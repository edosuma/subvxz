01:02.663 --> 01:04.396
<i>Not the way we play.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:07.232
<i>Seconds, centers, bottoms,</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:09.234
<i>stacking the deck,</i>

01:11.839 --> 01:14.740
<i>But just having</i>
<i>a pair of hands ain't enough.</i>

01:14.742 --> 01:17.910
<i>If you don't have</i>
<i>the stones to move under fire,</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:20.546
<i>you'll never get the money.</i>

01:20.548 --> 01:22.881
<i>So you work in fast company,</i>

01:22.883 --> 01:24.750
<i>hone your chops,</i>

01:24.752 --> 01:27.352
<i>learn to deal</i>
<i>with the unexpected.</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:30.289
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>you become a pro.</i>

01:30.291 --> 01:34.126
<i>That's how you become the Dean.</i>

01:39.066 --> 01:42.935
- Are we going to play some cards or what?
- Everybody freeze!

01:44.271 --> 01:46.472
Don't anybody fucking move!

01:46.474 --> 01:48.907
Come on, get your hands up.
Get 'em up.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.876
<i>Put your fucking hands up!</i>

01:50.878 --> 01:53.579
What the fuck is this, huh?!
What is this?!

01:53.581 --> 01:55.714
What are you talking about?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.817
Huh?!

01:58.819 --> 02:00.819
You guys know
who's running this game?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.188
Shut up, you fat fuck!
Now get your money out.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.725
Get your fucking hands up!

02:06.727 --> 02:08.727
Look, I'm not going
to do anything, okay?

02:08.729 --> 02:11.130
<i>Get 'em up now!</i>

02:12.066 --> 02:13.499
Okay.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.105
Man: <i>The appropriate
term here is...</i>

02:20.107 --> 02:21.306
<i>Fucked.</i>

02:22.143 --> 02:24.309
You mother...

04:15.356 --> 04:17.356
- Fill it up, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.507
Oh, shit!

04:37.878 --> 04:39.444
Are you all right?

04:39.446 --> 04:42.014
I just took my ring off in
the washroom and dropped it.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.923
If you or anybody else
finds this ring...

04:51.925 --> 04:53.458
actually it was
really expensive...

04:53.460 --> 04:55.894
whoever finds it,
I'll pay him a $1000 reward.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.496
Hey!

05:31.498 --> 05:32.597
Yo!

05:38.706 --> 05:40.772
Why don't I give you
$100 for it?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.774
This ring is worth
more than $100.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.142
Don't waste my time.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.378
Well, how much you want for it?

05:52.219 --> 05:54.553
260, 280,

05:54.555 --> 05:56.188
300.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.468
Come on, baby.
How much you get?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.210
Let's go.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.051
Charlie, here's your money.
Plenty there, all right?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.253
About fucking time, homer.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.754
Hey, Charlie,
van morrison, Vegas.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.523
Van morrison, count me in.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.111
Hey.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.717
Hey, Vespa, Toni.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.453
Hey there.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.528
Hey, Cody, how are you, man?

07:46.767 --> 07:49.334
Hey, hey, hey.
That's enough of that.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.169
- Hey, Charlie.
- How are you, baby?

07:53.807 --> 07:57.075
- Charlie.
- Carl, good to see you, man.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.833
Club.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.504
Jack of clubs, nine of hearts,

08:25.506 --> 08:27.272
eight of spades.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.676
All in.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.984
I call.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.152
All bets are in, gentlemen.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.888
On their backs.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.524
Three nines, pair of kings.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.559
Turn.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.060
Ouch.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.329
- Man: Oh, God, that's gotta hurt.
- Three kings.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.164
Baby, you're a 10,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.033
but I really need a nine.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.935
I'm out.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.739
That's how we do.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.674
Oh, this is great.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.577
Baby, you are a 10. I know you
thought I was bullshitting.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.281
High five.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.017
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, baby.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.986
- How you doing?
- I'm handling mine, taking all of this.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.721
- Mm-hmm. Big man.
- Yeah.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.723
Yeah, you bet your ponytail.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.892
You know, Miller's here.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.160
Who's that?

09:22.162 --> 09:24.429
Come on, Miller, the guy
I was telling you about.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.265
So Larry,
this is Charlie Miller.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.669
Miller, this is <i> the</i> Jennings,
Larry Jennings.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.105
Larry, that was pretty
hot shit downstairs.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.675
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, it was all right.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.344
T. Tells me that you play
pretty good yourself.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.612
Now and again, yeah.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.447
Yeah, right.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.350
- Can I get you some drinks, guys?
- Yeah, I'll take a refill.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.519
Okay. Charlie, you
still jd on the rocks?

09:47.521 --> 09:50.755
- In a bucket, baby.
- You got it.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.725
So Larry,
what do you know so far?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.227
What I do know is
that you and your partner

09:56.229 --> 09:57.629
found some seats at a soft game

09:57.631 --> 10:00.465
and you guys have been doing
pretty good on the regular.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.435
Yeah, that's right. It's taken
quite a while to set it up,

10:03.437 --> 10:04.803
but it's beginning to pay off.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.639
<i>Yeah, it's worth it.</i>
<i>10 to 20,000 a game.</i>

10:07.641 --> 10:09.874
<i>10, 20 thou? That's nice.</i>

10:09.876 --> 10:12.243
We could be doing a hell
of a lot better, you know?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.946
If we had a third player,
we'd tear this game apart.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.716
You're making money already. How
did I become the lucky guy?

10:17.718 --> 10:20.619
It's pretty obvious that you can
handle yourself well in a game.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.787
And Tiffany says
you're cool, so...

10:22.789 --> 10:25.323
Can I get you a drink?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.628
Well, uh...

10:29.630 --> 10:31.730
Can I get you some of me?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.832
Original.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.800
No, actually.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.102
I'm Jeff.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.637
Go away,<i> Jeff.</i>

10:38.639 --> 10:40.672
W-whoa, whoa, where do
you think you're going?

10:40.674 --> 10:42.974
My God!

10:42.976 --> 10:44.943
Hey, listen, get out
of my face, Jeff,

10:44.945 --> 10:47.445
or I will gladly shove my
heel down your throat.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.648
I like the sound of that.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.817
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.154
You stay here and think
about that, Jeff,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.490
while I walk away.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.625
Well, consider me interested.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.862
You got to raise
at least 15 to 20,000.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.464
15, 20... what, you want
me to give you the money?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.366
What, you trying
to pimp me now?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.602
It's the stake we all put in.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.203
It's a cash only game.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.838
<i>You need the playing money.</i>

11:13.840 --> 11:16.641
Come on, baby, I thought
you'd be interested in this.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.877
Charlie's come
all the way down here.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.445
But it's okay,
maybe he's just not...

11:20.447 --> 11:22.147
I know Charlie came
all the way down here.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.882
The money is no problem.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.984
The point is, I don't know
him, he doesn't know me,

11:25.986 --> 11:28.787
and I don't want to be wearing
a thong at the end of the day.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.556
For fuck's sakes, we're going
to be giving <i> you</i> the money,

11:31.558 --> 11:33.825
<i>not the other way around.</i>

11:33.827 --> 11:35.894
This is a hell
of an opportunity, Larry.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.200
What about the third musketeer?
When do I meet him?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.251
- Ohh!
- Ooh.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.319
Come on, let's go.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.856
I'm not feeling real well.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.058
- Jesus!
- <i> Fuck!</i>

12:09.596 --> 12:11.830
Watch where you're
going, bitch!

12:11.832 --> 12:14.532
Who are you calling
bitch, cocksucker?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.735
- Oh!
- Play nice, play nice!

12:16.737 --> 12:18.269
Get away from me!

12:22.776 --> 12:25.877
- Man: <i> Over here.</i>
- Woman: <i> Fuck that! Fuck you, bitch!</i>

12:25.879 --> 12:28.947
Fucking bitch! Fuck,
she fucking ruined it!

12:28.949 --> 12:31.182
Take 'em away from
me, all right?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.453
Give me a napkin, will you?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.122
Fuck! Jesus!

12:37.124 --> 12:39.057
- You okay there, miss?
- Oh, fine.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.126
- You, sir, how you doing?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.061
Aside from being down
20 grand, I'm just great.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.864
Any chance of raising
the limit on this table...

12:45.866 --> 12:47.132
To be five grand a hand?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.867
Let me see what I can do.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.302
What the fuck
are you looking at?

12:51.304 --> 12:52.604
Your tits.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.273
Yeah.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.909
He wants to raise the table
limit to five gs a hand.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.844
He's on a fresh shoot.
Fade him.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.914
It's done. Five a hand.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.150
Great. Damn nice of you.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.928
Woman: <i> Yes!</i>

13:16.930 --> 13:18.663
Dealer busts.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.803
Tearing me apart over there.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.805
Good work, ladies.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.509
40 gs for a half hour's work.
Not bad.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.977
You bet.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.914
There's your cut.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.683
You sure you don't want
to reconsider Reno?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.685
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.021
Besides, Jackie's good
enough to pull it off.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.823
Good enough for Reno, anyway.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.591
Woman: I'm almost out of beer.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.526
Man: <i>You got something set up?</i>

13:48.528 --> 13:50.428
Who, me?

13:51.965 --> 13:55.200
Great. I'll be in town
later this evening.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.602
Okay, see you then.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.437
Thanks.

14:02.776 --> 14:05.043
God, I wish the mob
still ran this town.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.011
So do I.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.716
This is a hell
of an opportunity, Larry.

14:11.718 --> 14:15.053
So what about the third musketeer?
When do I meet him?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.654
You can meet him
anytime you want.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.256
You can
meet him now if you like.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.860
So how do we know
this is going to pay off?

14:25.332 --> 14:28.199
Listen, come to this
address in an hour.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.968
<i>Go to the back room,</i>

14:29.970 --> 14:32.170
<i>ask for me. I'll be
there with my partner.</i>

14:32.172 --> 14:34.005
If the cards come funny
to all of us,

14:34.007 --> 14:36.241
how you gonna fix that?

14:36.242 --> 14:38.476
<i>Yeah, look, lady luck can
be a bitch at times.</i>

14:40.347 --> 14:42.513
<i>But fortunately, the guy
we're going to meet...</i>

14:42.515 --> 14:44.816
<i>my partner, he's a...</i>

14:44.818 --> 14:48.953
Larry, do you know
what a "mechanic" is?

15:06.940 --> 15:09.440
Christ, I can see
debris from here.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.945
I'm not even
dealing deuces, asshole.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.447
Pretty ugly-looking taps then.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.852
Maybe the chaps
are getting rusty.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.687
Is that so?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.356
Big slick in clubs. Two-handed.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.206
Pretty good.
That'd get the money.

15:42.208 --> 15:46.377
Yeah, but I always preferred
American airlines myself.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.447
Son of a bitch.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.383
Well, good to see you're
keeping the hands in shape.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.819
It's a hard habit to break.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.126
So what happened, Vernon?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.996
You disappeared like a fucking
ghost after the Ross game.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.899
I just needed
to get away for a while.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.500
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

16:09.502 --> 16:13.171
Well, for what it's worth,
Tiffany and I were...

16:13.173 --> 16:15.173
we were worried about you.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.009
We thought you'd gone South
because you'd taken some heat.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.979
It wasn't the cool thing to do.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.483
Yeah, well,
neither was Atlantic city.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.190
So how is Tiffany?

16:32.192 --> 16:35.093
We're great. Very great.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.196
She is an amazing woman.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.965
- You know, I never thought...
- What's the word on the game?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.600
Are we... are we set?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.335
Yeah, I'm starting you
at the game.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.038
Just got to get
your head in the moment.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.041
That guy I was telling you about,
he's coming here in a few minutes.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.642
I want you...

16:51.644 --> 16:54.512
Speak of the devil.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.447
That must be him.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.221
Hey! And the devil appears.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.189
Fuckin' a. Come on in.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.393
<i>Yeah, I heard</i>
<i>you were back in town.</i>

17:08.395 --> 17:12.563
But you know
what hurts me the most is,

17:12.565 --> 17:15.700
goddamn it,
you didn't even call.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.635
It must've slipped my mind.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.038
What the fuck
do you want, scarne?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.839
What the fuck you think I want?

17:21.840 --> 17:26.310
You know, we're kind of
in between jobs at the moment.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.479
Why don't you come back
in a couple of weeks

17:28.481 --> 17:31.315
and we'll see what we can do?

17:31.317 --> 17:33.518
Okay! Okay!

17:33.520 --> 17:36.254
I'll tell you what,
can we make that on a...

17:36.256 --> 17:38.489
Ah, come on.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.159
Jesus, come on, scarne,
you don't have to do that.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.393
See what you made me do?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.829
We don't have anything
going on right now, okay?

17:44.831 --> 17:48.066
Bullshit. If you didn't
have a line on something,

17:48.068 --> 17:49.068
you wouldn't be back here.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.035
He's telling you
the truth. The only...

17:51.037 --> 17:53.738
hold it.
When I want your opinion,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.974
I will dial
your fucking asshole.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.244
I'm kind of tapped
at the moment.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.147
All I got is a nickel on me.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.951
Jesus Christ. You weren't
kidding, were you?

18:06.953 --> 18:08.853
We're in a recession,
didn't you hear?

18:11.391 --> 18:13.524
Well, whatever.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.261
But just remember, boys,

18:17.263 --> 18:18.963
I want my cut.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.133
And I will get it one way...

18:22.135 --> 18:24.602
Or another.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.638
Uh, how's your...
how's your leg, by the way?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.010
It still hurts when it rains.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.813
Son of a bitch.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.648
Vernon: <i>Do yourself
a favor, scarne,</i>

18:37.650 --> 18:40.351
keep to extortion and leave
the real work to the pros.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.122
Pros.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.258
Hear Skinner got...
got run over by a car?

18:47.260 --> 18:50.161
Yeah, yeah.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.131
Unsolved hit and run.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.434
Real tragedy.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.836
To protect and serve, huh?

18:58.838 --> 19:01.339
Fuck off.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.951
Some things never change, huh?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.154
You're going
to dial <i> your</i> asshole.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.957
Oh, shit.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.259
Who is it?

19:21.261 --> 19:22.527
Jennings.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.197
This is the guys
t. Was telling you about.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.767
She says you know
your way around a game.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.235
Just got lucky.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.373
So Miller says that...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.341
You're the real deal
holyfield with the cards.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.278
I can handle
a deck pretty well.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.313
What is this, modesty night?

19:42.315 --> 19:43.781
Show him something.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.085
Four aces.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.976
That's kind of dope.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.344
<i>I told you he was good.</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.479
He's a goddamn artist.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.081
So you know the situation...

20:17.083 --> 20:19.383
we need a third to take
down some of the big pots.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.019
<i>If the same man keeps winning,
it arouses suspicion.</i>

20:22.021 --> 20:23.487
It's a big game.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.489
Soft game.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.226
Guys go all their lives trying
to get into a game like this.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.695
<i>So we've got to be really
careful how we handle it.</i>

20:30.697 --> 20:34.232
We need a top notch man.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.666
Uh-huh.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.235
So what you want me to do?

20:37.237 --> 20:40.238
You play on the square
during most of the game,

20:40.240 --> 20:41.639
except on my deal.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.910
Like your hand?

20:48.448 --> 20:51.449
Get the fuck out of here
with that Copperfield shit.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.017
Yeah, I like my hand.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.086
That's what's known
as base or bottom dealing.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.455
But I will vary it
by stacking as well

20:57.457 --> 20:59.290
and dealing the punch,
whatever it takes.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.792
But don't worry. You'll end
up a winner every time.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.794
Oh.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.263
So are you our man?

21:05.265 --> 21:08.266
I'm gonna fuck with y'all.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.900
- Great.
- For sure.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.269
<i>We'll give you</i>
<i>most of the stake,</i>

21:11.271 --> 21:12.937
so don't go
blowing it on a hunch.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.339
Just save it for the sure
thing on my deal, okay?

21:19.312 --> 21:22.480
Here's five, 10 grand.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.282
With your 15 that's 25.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.550
That gives us
enough money to play.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.154
But you are going to be the
one making the big bets.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.758
<i>You</i> are the one going to be
taking down the big pots.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.092
Okay?

21:35.094 --> 21:37.828
I'm good with that.
I like big shit.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.398
Show me the shit.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.651
Woman: <i>Well, I think
we're all here now.</i>

22:00.653 --> 22:03.020
You all know
Mr. Charlie Miller.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.122
- Man: Hey, Charlie.
- And this is Mr. Jennings,

22:05.124 --> 22:06.791
who will be joining us tonight.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.327
Would you sit there,
Mr. Jennings, please?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.462
Thank you.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.364
This is Mr. Andrews,

22:13.366 --> 22:16.334
and Mr. Ose, Mr. Leipzig,

22:16.336 --> 22:19.670
Charlie of course you know,
Dr. Daley and Mr. Vernon.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.773
- Good to meet you.
- Call me Larry.

22:22.775 --> 22:26.811
Mr. Jennings, we play
regular poker here.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.046
Stud, draw, lowball,

22:29.048 --> 22:30.781
<i>dealer's choice, no limit.</i>

22:30.783 --> 22:33.517
And of course, I take a small
percentage for the house.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.152
Yeah.

22:35.154 --> 22:38.856
Have a wonderful game,
all of you, and good luck.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.825
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.598
Okay, high card gets to deal.
Good luck, everyone.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.002
You get the ace.
It's your call.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.371
Let's ante up, gentlemen.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.740
<i>Nothing fancy, nothing wild,</i>

22:55.742 --> 22:58.008
just pray for cards
that make you smile.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.944
Corny corn.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.052
Jennings: <i>Baddest guitarist
in a white band, ace freely.</i>

23:09.222 --> 23:10.421
Three aces.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.693
Yeah, I know you're
in for that $25.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.262
Gonna put your kids
through school, grade school?

23:18.264 --> 23:20.164
Look.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.236
Nice-ass house, man. We should
be playing some bigger hands.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.671
<i>Know what I'm saying? Are we men, or...
What's going on?</i>

23:27.673 --> 23:31.509
I done came all the way up here.
Got my suit on and everything.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.744
What's with the arcade money?

23:39.919 --> 23:43.621
We gonna throw some logs on the
fire and let it blaze a little bit?

23:45.291 --> 23:46.624
Man: <i>Ace bets.</i>

23:47.627 --> 23:49.527
I'm going to get it
cracking already.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.862
Let's pop this cherry. Shall we fellas?
Can we do this?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.564
- Go ahead.
- Can we do this? $500.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.133
- <i> Oh.</i>
- <i> Spend some of that hmo money.</i>

23:56.135 --> 23:57.735
I'm out.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.303
- Too rich.
- Too rich?

23:59.305 --> 24:01.939
- I'm out.
- I'm in.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.240
My man.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.875
- <i> Are you out?</i>
- <i> Out.</i>

24:04.877 --> 24:08.078
Then stay out.
Me and my man will do it.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.214
Mmm, holler back.
You know what I'm gonna do?

24:10.216 --> 24:11.982
<i>Since I done</i>
<i>already popped the cherry,</i>

24:11.984 --> 24:15.286
I'm gonna take her out for a date.
2000 right there. Now what?

24:17.256 --> 24:18.689
Huh?

24:23.563 --> 24:25.229
Take it.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.398
- Take what?
- Take it.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.233
Y'all got to be
bullshitting with this.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.968
I spend more than this
in a strip club.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.637
- You want to tell me how to play cards?
- <i> I'm not trying...</i>

24:33.639 --> 24:36.240
- <i> you want my chips, too?</i>
- <i> I would like to get some of those chips.</i>

24:36.242 --> 24:38.409
<i>I can't get 'em unless you
put 'em on the table.</i>

24:38.411 --> 24:40.444
- Get a drink around here?
- A drink?

24:40.446 --> 24:42.480
Shit, what is these chips,
potato chips?

24:42.482 --> 24:45.516
Shit, come on, man, this is poker.
$200. Somebody bounce with me.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.619
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.588
- You pushed me out.
- Fuck.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.858
- I'm out.
- Me too.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.860
You folding too.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.996
I'm with you, bro'.
Let's keep it black.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.299
It's 200.
I'll raise you 200 more.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.502
That's for Jesse.
"Keep hope alive."

25:04.504 --> 25:06.604
I'm going.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.673
Okay, I'm gonna
keep it black like my ass,

25:09.675 --> 25:12.276
and I'm gonna raise you three grand.
Check your rent money.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.577
What's your wangdang look like?

25:15.381 --> 25:17.882
- Hmm? Come on, black.
- Too rich for my blood, bro'.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.551
Fuck on, man, this is
supposed to be a big game.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.820
We're supposed to be playing some big money.
What is this?

25:22.822 --> 25:25.189
G-15, bingo! You all playing
bingo in this bitch,

25:25.191 --> 25:26.724
<i>'cause you</i>
<i>ain't spending no money.</i>

25:26.726 --> 25:30.027
This is bullshit.
I can't believe this.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.229
I think it's time we took a
little break, gentlemen.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.964
Man: <i> Sounds good to me.</i>

25:33.966 --> 25:35.733
Got some kool-aid
in this motherfucker?

25:35.735 --> 25:37.401
Where'd you get this big man?

25:37.403 --> 25:39.169
Let's just take a break.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.038
Leipzig: <i>I thought we
had a civilized game.</i>

25:41.040 --> 25:43.407
Man: <i>Everybody calm down.</i>

25:43.409 --> 25:46.510
I can't believe this. $5, $10.

25:46.512 --> 25:49.647
You want to tell people
how to play poker,

25:49.649 --> 25:51.015
maybe you could open a school.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.317
I can tell you about the
hair on your chest.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.085
Are you cool?

25:55.087 --> 25:57.721
No, I ain't cool. Five hands, I'm
only up a few hundred dollars?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.657
Fuck it, man. It's not
an exact science.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.759
You just have to wait
for the right time.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.761
Fuck that. This is
wasting my time.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.596
I could do better by myself.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.064
Relax, will you?

26:07.066 --> 26:09.366
You cannot control
how the other players bet.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.335
You just gotta wait
your time, be patient.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.003
It'll pay off, I promise you.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.172
Yeah, it better.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.375
Five card draw, nothing's wild.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.945
Drinks, gentlemen?

26:20.947 --> 26:23.547
We don't need no drinks.
We just need to play.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.950
- <i> Let's get it cracking.</i>
- Let's do that.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.990
Good?

26:38.464 --> 26:40.130
Looking good already.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.134
All right,
let's start with 100.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.769
Your hundred, and 200 more.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.308
300 to me.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.477
Let's do three more.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.580
Six to me. Make it four more

26:56.582 --> 26:59.617
for an even grand.
How about that?

27:00.720 --> 27:03.587
- I'm out.
- Going, huh? Little thick?

27:03.589 --> 27:06.657
I'll see your grand,

27:06.659 --> 27:09.293
and I'll raise you two
granddaddies... that's 2000.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.295
Holler back.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.663
I'm out.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.834
The man with style
is a man that can smile.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.269
- <i> I'm out.</i>
- You should come out with a rap album.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.409
Leipzig: <i>Two grand to me. I'm
gonna take a look at my cards.</i>

27:25.411 --> 27:27.411
Call that.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.646
I think I'll follow your lead.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.849
Cards, fellas?

27:31.851 --> 27:33.851
Two please.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.953
- <i> Two.</i>
- Just give me one, man.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.156
One card like my bitch.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.358
The dealer takes one.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.870
<i>All right, holler back.</i>

27:52.872 --> 27:54.772
Two grand again.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.677
I'm out.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.679
Come on, brother. Nothing, huh?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.751
Well, what the hell?

28:09.722 --> 28:13.624
It feels about like it's 12 gs.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.867
All right, well...

28:23.869 --> 28:26.003
Whoo, it's getting hot.
Hot in here.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.871
Let's say... Five grand more?

28:30.409 --> 28:31.642
Well...

28:36.816 --> 28:39.850
I assume cash
is acceptable, right?

28:39.852 --> 28:44.354
- Of course.
- 'Cause I happen to have a little bit on me.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.823
Jesus Christ.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.257
Man: <i> Shit!</i>

28:48.327 --> 28:50.794
That calls your bluff
right there.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.633
That's $82,500.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.104
No limit, right?

29:00.106 --> 29:02.372
This son of a bitch
gonna buy it.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.874
Oh, it's bought.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.909
Excuse... excuse... excuse me.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.945
Excuse me, Mr. Jennings.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.082
- Is my marker good here?
- Of course.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.185
Hell no. What the fuck is that?
I'm American express up in here?

29:15.187 --> 29:18.122
What the fuck is this mark shit?
If you don't have the chips...

29:18.124 --> 29:21.391
excuse me,
but I have the money.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.960
I just don't have it on me.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.928
I got a jet,
I just didn't fly here.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.531
Mr. Jennings, I can assure you
that he has plenty of money,

29:27.533 --> 29:30.100
<i>and he always pays his debts.</i>

29:30.102 --> 29:32.536
Now his marker is good at this table.
You are called.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.108
Fuck it, it don't matter.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.611
I've only had four
girlfriends in my life,

29:40.613 --> 29:42.880
and they was all 10s.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.850
Shit.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.888
You motherfuckers.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.891
Excuse me. I guess every
one of those girls

29:53.893 --> 29:55.692
was fucking a guy named Jack.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.530
Take a look.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.533
No, that's not... Possible.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.005
Whoa, whoa!

30:08.007 --> 30:09.840
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

30:09.842 --> 30:11.742
Let me explain.
What I'm saying is, look,

30:11.744 --> 30:14.645
this money is not the money
that I'm trying to bet with.

30:14.647 --> 30:17.114
- Let me give you an iou.
- A little cab fare, there you go.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.283
Dina, can't you take his iou?

30:19.285 --> 30:22.186
The cash right here
is not the money I'm supp...

30:22.188 --> 30:25.422
supposed...
miss whatever your name is...

30:25.424 --> 30:27.524
look, my man,
let me get you an iou.

30:27.526 --> 30:31.261
What were you thinking, Larry?

30:31.263 --> 30:34.965
You were told just to bet
on Vernon's deal, right?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.667
I know, I know.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.702
And what's with pulling
out the big bankroll?

30:38.704 --> 30:40.971
Because I had a four of a kind.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.940
Shit.

30:42.942 --> 30:47.344
Okay, just relax, man.
Relax. You know what?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.880
We're going to get those sons
of bitches the next time.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.015
But you've got
to start listening to me.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.518
You got to start getting
with the program, Larry.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.453
You don't...
you don't understand.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.655
Shit!

30:58.657 --> 31:00.390
Listen, if you're
short of some cash,

31:00.392 --> 31:02.192
I can lend you
a couple hundred.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.461
A few hundred dollars ain't
gonna do nothing for me.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.897
That just went swimmingly.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.032
Were we not clear, Larry?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.701
Only bet heavy on my deal.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.336
That way I can
control the outcome.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.904
You know, cheat.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.039
Man, I don't want to hear
this shit right now.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.008
- Fuck!
- Larry... Larry, listen.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.711
This is just
a bump in the road.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.913
We're going to get
this back tenfold.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.349
Only if Nick the Greek here
learns to control himself.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.551
Would you leave him alone?
Leave him alone.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.053
- Relax.
- Fuck!

31:30.055 --> 31:32.689
You'll get back twice what you
lost in a couple of weeks.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.925
- I swear to you.
- I don't have a couple of weeks.

31:34.927 --> 31:38.729
Damn! Motherfuckers ain't
hearing what I'm saying?

31:38.731 --> 31:40.597
Shit.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.000
- Hey, Larry.
- Don't give me that shit right now.

31:43.002 --> 31:46.436
Nice to see you, too.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.739
What the hell was that about?

31:50.509 --> 31:52.609
He had a...

31:52.611 --> 31:54.978
a really bad night.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.018
Fuck it.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.121
Man: To your health.

32:06.292 --> 32:09.026
I wish that you
could've joined me.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.696
They do a lovely
lichee-nut Martini here.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.601
Respect.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.939
I think respect
is one of the Paramount

32:21.941 --> 32:24.574
tenets of human relations.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.143
It says in the Bible,

32:26.145 --> 32:29.880
"thou shalt respect
thy mother and thy father."

32:29.882 --> 32:31.949
I respect Mr. Malini.

32:31.951 --> 32:35.652
He has respected me as a
father respects his son.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.055
We've respected you.

32:38.057 --> 32:41.024
<i>But frankly you've</i>
<i>disappointed us.</i>

32:41.961 --> 32:43.994
Hello, Nate.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.930
Would you care
for something to eat?

32:46.932 --> 32:48.565
No, thanks.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.767
You see my friend here,
he probably prefers

32:50.769 --> 32:53.170
a double king chili cheese
with an egg on it.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.738
And a shake.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.774
And I respect that.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.876
Oh, excuse me.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.480
I'm vibrating.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.417
Hello, marlo. Yes?

33:09.021 --> 33:11.822
Information? Who is this?

33:11.824 --> 33:13.623
<i>Is that so?</i>

33:13.625 --> 33:14.958
<i>I'll do that.</i>

33:14.960 --> 33:18.161
Who is this?

33:19.431 --> 33:20.764
They hung up.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.602
No respect.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.325
You're hitting the hard stuff

33:48.327 --> 33:50.193
kind of early, aren't you?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.129
What the fuck y'all want?

33:53.032 --> 33:55.899
Mr. Malini would like
to have a word with you.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.103
Right now?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.373
Patience isn't
one of his virtues.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.420
<i>Larry, I understand you're
a very good card player.</i>

34:17.422 --> 34:20.489
Yeah, I mess around
a little bit.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.690
- Do you?
- Yeah.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.493
Pick up
the motherfucking phone.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.263
I heard you're quite a
brilliant poker player.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.099
Well, if that's what they say,
then that's what it is.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.833
How's it going?

34:32.237 --> 34:35.438
It's got its ups and downs.
That's how it goes.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.007
- <i> Ups and downs?</i>
- Yeah.

34:38.010 --> 34:40.543
<i>You know, I'm not</i>
<i>much of a card player,</i>

34:40.545 --> 34:43.280
but would you say that losing

34:43.282 --> 34:46.516
80,000 U.S. dollars is a down?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.418
Yeah, that's... fuck!

34:49.420 --> 34:51.353
Yeah, that's a down.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.090
And would it be a down

34:53.092 --> 34:56.626
if I lost that 80,000
out of last week's take?

34:56.628 --> 34:58.295
I said it would be a down, man.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.098
If you already know, you know.
What's with the silly questions?

35:01.100 --> 35:04.201
Did you really think you could
lose 80,000 of Max's money

35:04.203 --> 35:07.104
and he'd not find out
about it in this town?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.572
I'm gonna square that
away with Max.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.208
How could you be
so fucking stupid, Larry?

35:11.210 --> 35:14.644
I'm in it with these guys, one guy can
do anything with a deck of cards.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.047
They take me to this game.
We're supposed to win it.

35:17.049 --> 35:18.882
I get carried away
on this one had and I...

35:18.884 --> 35:20.917
I shouldn't have bet on it,

35:20.919 --> 35:23.587
and I lost. I can't blame
nobody but myself.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.655
I just... I didn't do
what they said to do.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.557
Did it ever occur to you

35:27.559 --> 35:29.893
that you were
the one hustled, Larry?

35:29.895 --> 35:31.962
<i>That your so-called partners</i>

35:31.964 --> 35:34.131
were professional grifters?

35:34.133 --> 35:35.599
They were con men?

35:35.601 --> 35:37.300
No, no, no,

35:37.302 --> 35:39.369
because they lost
their money, too.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.340
Dina: Well, I think
we're all here.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.809
This is...

35:51.817 --> 35:55.852
boy reaches for his stash and I
thought I was going to shit.

35:55.854 --> 35:59.656
- Hey, baby.
- Do you like that?

35:59.658 --> 36:03.193
Tiffany: Hey, I told you
it would feel good.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.195
Marlo: <i>The whole
thing was a setup.</i>

36:05.197 --> 36:06.363
I got 60 even.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.465
You believe me now, Larry?

36:08.467 --> 36:11.034
They had...

36:12.671 --> 36:14.304
A buffet.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.173
Beautiful jacket.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.375
Always a pleasure.

36:24.116 --> 36:26.483
Charlie: <i>Son of a bitch
never knew what hit him.</i>

36:26.485 --> 36:29.019
Five card draw. Nothing's wild.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.388
- Charlie: <i> Work of art.</i>
- Drinks, gentlemen?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.456
No, we don't need no drinks.
We just need to play.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.726
<i>Francis brought in the drinks</i>
<i>as Jack brought in the cooler.</i>

36:36.728 --> 36:39.296
<i>Cooler on his own deal.</i>

36:39.298 --> 36:41.464
It is good to be back.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.633
It's certainly turning out
to be profitable.

36:43.635 --> 36:47.370
I've got to say, you sure
know how to pick 'em, baby.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.972
That's what I'm here for.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.910
This is a hell
of an opportunity, Larry.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.314
So when do I meet
the third musketeer?

36:57.316 --> 37:00.183
Anytime you want. You can
meet him now, if you like.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.085
Yeah.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.020
I'm gonna go cash out.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.122
I'll call you later.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.228
He's pretty good.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.096
Where'd you get him?

37:14.366 --> 37:17.400
A couple of weeks ago
at another club.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.502
Y'all count 'em.

37:19.504 --> 37:23.440
He had the rolex,
he had a brand new lexus.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.242
He's made for it.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.177
I've always said it, baby...

37:27.179 --> 37:29.312
you are the best.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.349
Have you seen Vernon yet?

37:32.351 --> 37:34.417
<i>I'm seeing him</i>
<i>later on tonight.</i>

37:34.419 --> 37:36.353
<i>How is he?</i>

37:36.355 --> 37:38.221
You know Vernon.
Vernon's Vernon.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.257
- You know how he is.
- Yeah.

37:43.895 --> 37:47.264
What are you doing?
You've got one lit already.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.303
Listen, if...

37:53.305 --> 37:55.905
if working with Vernon
is going to be a problem...

37:55.907 --> 37:58.241
what?

37:58.243 --> 38:00.410
Come on, Charlie...

38:00.412 --> 38:02.779
Don't worry about me.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.989
It's me.

38:12.991 --> 38:16.126
Got it. I'll meet you there.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.063
Well, well, well.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.866
Looks like you're
all alone now, huh?

38:23.835 --> 38:25.135
Lucky me.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.171
Who is that?

38:28.173 --> 38:30.640
None of your fucking
business, that's who.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.243
Do you know what
a "mechanic" is, Larry?

38:33.245 --> 38:36.112
So were you serious before?

38:36.114 --> 38:38.181
Is that your scene?

38:39.318 --> 38:41.251
Scene?

38:41.253 --> 38:44.187
Yeah, or were you just talking
shit trying to get laid?

38:44.189 --> 38:46.489
Oh, I'm...

38:46.491 --> 38:49.025
I'm into it, mate.

38:49.027 --> 38:52.362
Yeah, well, we'll
see about that.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.331
Come on, Jeff.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.503
Okay, so what about
a safe word?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.505
What?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.341
You know, in case
one of us feels

39:04.343 --> 39:06.509
we're going too far.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.678
Okay, how about...

39:08.680 --> 39:10.280
"Eclipse"?

39:10.282 --> 39:12.215
Either one of use
feels uncomfortable,

39:12.217 --> 39:14.351
we say eclipse,
we take a time out.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.419
Sure, baby, whatever you want.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.637
So how do you like it, Jeff?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.639
Rough.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.603
Hey, Tiffany, how are ya?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.738
Hey, Teddy, I'm good.
How's your family?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.573
Oh, they're great...
great, thanks.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.877
Say, it surprised me a little
to get that telephone call.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.912
I didn't know
you still did this.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.549
- Yeah, well, I needed some fast cash, you know?
- <i> On the road with Miller?</i>

40:19.551 --> 40:21.818
Something like that.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.790
What did you say?

40:26.792 --> 40:29.092
I can't hear you
with that thing in your mouth.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.860
Eclipse.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.030
Rough enough for you, baby?

40:39.771 --> 40:42.772
I've got to say, you sure
know how to pick 'em, baby.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.541
That's what I'm here for.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.577
<i>So you think Jennings</i>
<i>will be back for more?</i>

40:47.579 --> 40:49.579
Fish like that
always come back.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.115
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- No? Why not?

40:52.117 --> 40:55.985
Jennings, he seemed...
something was off.

40:55.987 --> 40:59.255
He just dropped his entire
life's savings in one hand.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.590
Tends to wig a guy out.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.460
- No, it was more than that.
- Fuck him.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.396
You know that's a trait you're
going to have to get rid of...

41:06.398 --> 41:08.832
feeling sorry for the mark.
The way I look at it,

41:08.834 --> 41:11.000
guy isn't smart enough
to hold on to his money,

41:11.002 --> 41:12.769
he doesn't deserve
to have it. Right, baby?

41:12.771 --> 41:14.671
- You said it.
- <i> See? She understands.</i>

41:14.673 --> 41:17.207
Let's go get a drink.
Come on. Let's go.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.312
The suspense is killing me. What's
the word on the game? Is he sitting?

41:24.649 --> 41:26.182
Yeah, he's in.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.218
Holy shit.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.820
Tiffany: <i>Come on, guys, who?</i>

41:30.822 --> 41:33.923
Dean fucking Stevens,
that's who.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.492
"Dad" Stevens.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.360
Charlie: <i>The man himself.</i>

41:37.362 --> 41:39.496
I mean, this guy,
he's a legend.

41:39.498 --> 41:42.499
<i>He was younger than I was when
he started playing the big time.</i>

41:42.501 --> 41:44.534
Big time? This guy sat
down with gangsters,

41:44.536 --> 41:46.202
fucking killers, mobsters.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.671
- <i> Not for the money...</i>
- <i> No, no, just to hone his chops.</i>

41:48.673 --> 41:50.607
Tiffany:
<i>I guess that would do it.</i>

41:50.609 --> 41:52.609
There was one night
in Philadelphia,

41:52.611 --> 41:54.511
all these mobsters
sitting around a table,

41:54.513 --> 41:56.679
<i>he's working the game</i>
<i>when out of nowhere, bang...</i>

41:56.681 --> 41:58.515
- <i> Everybody freeze!</i>
- <i> ...The place gets hit.</i>

41:58.517 --> 42:00.483
<i>Everyone's got</i>
<i>their hands in the air.</i>

42:00.485 --> 42:03.319
- Man: <i> What is this?</i>
- <i> Everyone but Stevens.</i>

42:03.321 --> 42:06.723
<i>As luck would have it, he'd just
gone South and was holding out.</i>

42:06.725 --> 42:09.559
<i>Well, the place explodes.</i>

42:09.561 --> 42:11.494
<i>A huge gunfight</i>
<i>and everyone but Stevens</i>

42:11.496 --> 42:13.897
<i>and one of the wise guys</i>
<i>go down.</i>

42:13.899 --> 42:17.901
<i>Stevens and the other guy,</i>
<i>they end up in a standoff.</i>

42:17.903 --> 42:19.903
Vernon: <i>Yeah, and they
had three choices...</i>

42:19.905 --> 42:23.406
<i>start shooting, walk away</i>
<i>and leave the money...</i>

42:23.408 --> 42:25.808
...or three?

42:33.552 --> 42:35.652
We cut for it.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.420
High card takes it all.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.589
<i>I know which I prefer.</i>

43:07.519 --> 43:09.285
Nothing ventured...

43:12.724 --> 43:14.290
Nothing gained.

43:19.864 --> 43:21.631
Charlie: <i>He walked
away with 50 grand,</i>

43:21.633 --> 43:22.732
<i>not even a scratch.</i>

43:22.734 --> 43:24.067
Tiffany: <i> Wow.</i>

43:24.069 --> 43:25.969
Charlie: <i>Maybe it's
just a fucking myth.</i>

43:25.971 --> 43:28.371
<i>Maybe Stevens</i>
<i>made the whole thing up.</i>

43:28.373 --> 43:30.373
It's a great
fucking story, though.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.774
Yeah.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.977
There are guys that'll
drop their entire bankroll

43:33.979 --> 43:36.245
just to say they sat
at the same table as him.

43:36.247 --> 43:37.981
The Dean.

43:50.395 --> 43:53.096
- So will you be staying with us very long?
- Just a few days.

43:53.098 --> 43:55.798
- Business or pleasure?
- Business.

44:10.749 --> 44:13.082
Whoever takes the Dean
becomes the Dean.

44:13.084 --> 44:14.851
Well, he's never been taken.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.753
Not yet.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.756
Don't' get so cocky. I don't
want a repeat of Atlantic city.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.057
Yeah, well, neither do I.

44:41.479 --> 44:44.681
Well, I'll be damned.

44:45.884 --> 44:47.684
Good to see you, Eve.

44:47.686 --> 44:49.952
It's good to see you, too.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.057
Frank...

44:54.059 --> 44:56.225
It has been a while, hasn't it?

44:57.729 --> 45:00.897
Yeah, it's been a while.
You look good.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.865
I do, don't I?

45:06.171 --> 45:08.137
You don't look so bad yourself.

45:10.809 --> 45:12.909
Nice place you got here.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.511
Yeah, a lot of work.

45:15.513 --> 45:17.914
<i>You should have seen it</i>
<i>when I first got it.</i>

45:19.751 --> 45:22.018
So...

45:22.020 --> 45:23.619
So.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.256
I was just in town for this
game and I thought I'd...

45:27.258 --> 45:28.925
you hungry?

45:30.562 --> 45:32.895
Famished.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.231
So you saw Stevens play, right?

45:35.233 --> 45:38.067
Oh, I sure did.
Omaha, Nebraska,

45:38.069 --> 45:41.104
24th of may, 1986.
I'll never forget it.

45:41.106 --> 45:43.272
I saw him gut a mob
that tried to set him up,

45:43.274 --> 45:46.175
and he did it in such a way
that it was a thing of beauty.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.778
I will never forget it
as long as I live.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.513
Quit trying to scare me.

45:50.515 --> 45:53.015
I'm not trying to scare you. I'm
just trying to prepare you.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.051
This isn't some whale
who sits down beside you

45:55.053 --> 45:56.853
and says, "here, please,
take my money."

45:56.855 --> 45:59.856
This guy can cut you into little
pieces, you won't even know it.

46:01.693 --> 46:04.127
So are you... are you happy?

46:04.129 --> 46:07.063
Sure... I mean, sometimes.

46:07.065 --> 46:09.799
You know, that's life.

46:09.801 --> 46:12.769
Well, it looks like things are
really working out for you.

46:12.771 --> 46:15.104
You never know what's
going to happen to somebody

46:15.106 --> 46:16.873
once they get off the grift.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.641
But I'm happy for you, really.

46:18.643 --> 46:19.909
Thanks.

46:19.911 --> 46:21.944
No husband or kids?

46:23.915 --> 46:27.450
God... no.

46:27.452 --> 46:30.887
- Not for a lack of opportunities, though.
- Of course.

46:30.889 --> 46:33.656
I guess you're
a tough act to follow.

46:35.326 --> 46:37.126
When you have
your life's savings

46:37.128 --> 46:40.830
riding on the turn of a
card every other night,

46:40.832 --> 46:43.900
then paying a mortgage
can seem rather mundane.

46:43.902 --> 46:45.868
Yeah, I guess.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.473
What?

46:50.475 --> 46:53.810
Lately I've been thinking that
worrying about paying a mortgage

46:53.812 --> 46:55.745
might not be such a bad thing.

46:55.747 --> 46:58.347
- Oh, come on.
- No, I'm serious.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.683
More and more it's starting
to feel like work.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.320
I know the feeling.

47:04.322 --> 47:07.957
I'm starting to feel
like this old gunfighter.

47:07.959 --> 47:10.660
Like every game I go to,
every town,

47:10.662 --> 47:12.495
there's always some kid

47:12.497 --> 47:14.797
who's dreaming about
knocking off the Dean.

47:14.799 --> 47:16.933
And I used to love it,

47:16.935 --> 47:19.101
'cause everybody wanted
a piece of me,

47:19.103 --> 47:20.837
sitting around that table
and knowing

47:20.839 --> 47:23.639
that no one
could even touch me.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.641
But these last couple of years,

47:25.643 --> 47:27.977
I'm just going through
the motions,

47:27.979 --> 47:29.879
getting lazy, not caring.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.115
I'm losing my edge.

47:33.117 --> 47:36.052
So I say to myself,
maybe I oughta retire,

47:36.054 --> 47:37.887
go out gracefully,

47:37.889 --> 47:41.557
before some kid comes along
and just rips me apart.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.994
Charlie: <i>One small problem...</i>

47:44.996 --> 47:48.064
we need 250
to get into the game.

47:48.066 --> 47:51.400
- Whew, man, that's quite a stake.
- Prime rib.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.536
<i>The way I figure it is this...</i>

47:53.538 --> 47:55.137
six, seven, 'round the table,

47:55.139 --> 47:58.174
the pot's two million at least,
just for starters.

47:58.176 --> 48:01.878
- <i> I've got 100 grand.</i>
- I don't know.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.280
You really think
you can take Stevens?

48:05.917 --> 48:08.918
Eve: <i>The Dean retire?</i>

48:08.920 --> 48:10.486
That would be a first.

48:11.923 --> 48:14.357
I don't know,
seeing how well you've done

48:14.359 --> 48:16.359
just gets me thinking.

48:16.361 --> 48:18.227
Thinking can
get you in trouble.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.898
Maybe I don't know
what I'm talking about.

48:24.002 --> 48:27.103
So are you a restauranteur now?

48:29.107 --> 48:32.108
Well, I'm still trying
to figure that one out.

48:32.944 --> 48:35.111
Do you think
a happy restauranteur

48:35.113 --> 48:36.345
could be...

48:36.347 --> 48:38.481
Happy with a retired card man?

48:42.020 --> 48:44.954
Well, I'll let you
know when I meet one.

48:47.225 --> 48:49.125
Maybe we should
meet again tomorrow night.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.132
Maybe we should.

48:56.134 --> 48:57.733
Come to the game.

48:57.735 --> 49:00.469
"Come to the game, Eve."

49:02.307 --> 49:04.640
I might be able to come by

49:04.642 --> 49:06.108
when I close up.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.312
I'd like that.

49:09.314 --> 49:12.481
I always did love
to watch you play.

49:13.718 --> 49:16.285
But the best mechanic
doesn't always win the game.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.487
<i>Don't worry.</i>

49:18.489 --> 49:20.923
This time I'll be patient.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.458
I'll wait for the right moment.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.926
And when he makes his move,

49:23.928 --> 49:26.662
I'll gut the son of a
bitch in one hand.

49:28.933 --> 49:30.633
That's what I like to hear.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.503
Okay, I'm in.

49:34.505 --> 49:36.238
But I am coming to this game.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.007
I've got to watch
over my investment.

49:38.009 --> 49:40.343
Well, this puts us
over the top.

49:40.345 --> 49:43.612
I guess I'll go
make that phone call,

49:43.614 --> 49:44.981
tell them we're in the game.

49:48.286 --> 49:50.119
You know what's really cool?

49:50.121 --> 49:51.721
We're back together again.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.491
The old team,
just like the old days.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.362
It's good to have
you back, kid.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.140
It is, you know.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.075
Is what?

50:16.147 --> 50:17.947
Good to have you back.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.350
I'm not back. I'm just
here for the game.

50:23.154 --> 50:24.920
All right.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.961
So how's working single o?

50:33.031 --> 50:34.063
It's fine.

50:34.065 --> 50:36.832
It must be sort of
limiting though, huh?

50:36.834 --> 50:40.169
Yeah, but it's
got its advantages.

50:40.171 --> 50:43.005
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

50:43.007 --> 50:46.142
I don't have to worry about your
partner stabbing me in the back.

50:48.012 --> 50:50.279
Or waking up
with a kidney missing.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.918
Tell Charlie
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

51:15.273 --> 51:18.274
Shit!

51:18.276 --> 51:21.210
Do not sneak up
on me like that.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.279
Oh God.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.248
Are you okay?

51:26.250 --> 51:29.118
Yeah, just checking
my messages.

51:32.056 --> 51:33.889
So where did Vernon go?

51:33.891 --> 51:35.124
I don't know. He split.

51:40.631 --> 51:41.797
What do you want?

51:41.799 --> 51:43.699
Tiffany: <i>I need to talk.</i>

51:43.701 --> 51:47.636
- Now?
- <i> Yeah, now.</i>

51:47.638 --> 51:50.039
Charlie: <i>Such a moody
guy, that Vernon.</i>

51:50.041 --> 51:52.274
Tell me about it.

51:53.144 --> 51:55.878
Listen, now that he's back,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.447
there's a couple of things I
want to talk to you about.

51:58.449 --> 52:01.650
Oh, Charlie, I'm beat.

52:02.620 --> 52:03.886
Thanks.

52:08.726 --> 52:11.293
Tiffany: <i>I wanted to explain
about Atlantic city.</i>

52:11.295 --> 52:13.329
Vernon: <i>I don't need
an explanation.</i>

52:13.331 --> 52:16.732
Tiffany: <i>Well, I need to. I
didn't mean for it to happen.</i>

52:16.734 --> 52:19.068
Vernon: <i>I don't see the point.
Once the game is over,</i>

52:19.070 --> 52:20.803
<i>I'm out of here</i>
<i>and you and Charlie</i>

52:20.805 --> 52:23.172
<i>can go back to whatever
it is you have going on.</i>

52:23.174 --> 52:25.741
Tiffany: <i>There is nothing going on.
We're just partners.</i>

52:25.743 --> 52:27.510
Vernon:
<i>Last time I saw you two,</i>

52:27.512 --> 52:30.112
<i>it appeared a lot different</i>
<i>than just being partners.</i>

52:30.114 --> 52:32.681
- Tiffany: <i> It doesn't mean anything.</i>
- <i> Tell that to Charlie.</i>

52:32.683 --> 52:36.118
- <i> I was just frustrated.</i>
- <i> Yeah, I can see how frustrated you are.</i>

52:36.120 --> 52:39.588
<i>Come on, t., nothing with
you ever just happens.</i>

52:39.590 --> 52:41.290
<i>I don't know what your</i>
<i>angle was,</i>

52:41.292 --> 52:43.425
<i>but I wasn't going</i>
<i>to stick around and find out.</i>

52:43.427 --> 52:46.095
Tiffany: <i>There wasn't any angle.
I just made a mistake.</i>

52:46.097 --> 52:48.864
<i>I mean, you just</i>
<i>took all that cash.</i>

52:48.866 --> 52:50.833
<i>I had a right</i>
<i>to be pissed and upset.</i>

52:50.835 --> 52:53.869
<i>Charlie was just there
saying all the right things.</i>

52:53.871 --> 52:56.305
Vernon: <i>I should never have
fallen in love with you.</i>

52:56.307 --> 52:58.707
<i>You had me feeling like a mark.</i>

52:58.709 --> 53:00.676
Tiffany: <i>How can you say that?</i>

53:00.678 --> 53:03.712
<i>You were the only one I didn't
have to play a role with.</i>

53:03.714 --> 53:05.748
<i>I miss that.</i>

53:07.018 --> 53:09.218
I miss it too.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.353
So what are we going
to do about it?

53:14.392 --> 53:16.358
We're not going to do
anything about it.

53:18.129 --> 53:20.396
I'm not going to hurt Charlie.

53:20.398 --> 53:23.132
You mean, like the way
he hurt you?

53:27.305 --> 53:28.470
I thought you quit.

53:30.308 --> 53:32.641
Yeah, well...

53:33.644 --> 53:37.379
You, smoking,

53:37.381 --> 53:40.316
all my old vices
are becoming versas.

53:56.267 --> 53:58.234
Vernon: <i> Oh good.</i>

53:58.236 --> 54:01.270
Listen now,
can you do me a favor?

54:02.373 --> 54:05.007
Can you come by
tomorrow around 2:00?

54:05.009 --> 54:07.576
There's a couple of things I
want to talk to you about.

54:08.546 --> 54:11.447
You know, personal,

54:11.449 --> 54:13.682
just you and me.

54:13.684 --> 54:16.685
Sure. I'll see you then.

54:16.687 --> 54:18.020
Mm-hmm.

54:51.255 --> 54:53.422
Jennings: <i>These motherfuckers
set me up, all right?</i>

54:53.424 --> 54:55.157
That bitch had
something to do with it.

54:55.159 --> 54:57.993
These motherfuckers... I
usually don't work like that.

54:57.995 --> 55:00.429
I usually work by myself...
should've been by myself.

55:00.431 --> 55:02.331
<i>They disrespected me</i>
<i>in doing that.</i>

55:02.333 --> 55:04.933
<i>They disrespected Max.</i>
<i>They disrespected everybody.</i>

55:04.935 --> 55:07.269
Max is looking at me now
like it's some fucked up shit.

55:07.271 --> 55:08.937
Like I would really
steal from Max.

55:08.939 --> 55:10.773
Max is my dawg, man.
You know what I'm saying?

55:10.775 --> 55:12.841
I couldn't believe
I didn't see it coming,

55:12.843 --> 55:15.444
but I had a great hand, and then
I didn't have a great hand.

55:15.446 --> 55:18.380
Motherfuckers, they... motherfuckers
is good... they good.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.691
I'm going to take care
of a couple things.

55:28.693 --> 55:30.359
I'll be right back.
Don't worry.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.828
Yeah, sure, sure.
Take care of that.

55:35.499 --> 55:36.732
Oh, fuck.

55:56.354 --> 55:57.519
Shit!

56:11.802 --> 56:13.869
Hi, I'm looking
for a Mr. Miller,

56:13.871 --> 56:16.839
a Mr. Charlie Miller.
Do you know him?

56:16.841 --> 56:18.907
You're kidding me, right?

56:25.850 --> 56:27.383
The corner booth.

56:27.385 --> 56:31.053
I just needed change for the
condom dispenser. Thank you.

56:49.373 --> 56:50.506
Take a seat.

56:56.180 --> 56:57.679
Are you Charlie Miller?

56:57.681 --> 56:59.448
Charlie Miller?

56:59.450 --> 57:01.283
I know who you're
talking about.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.918
Cool guy, kind of handsome.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.453
You want to get
a message to him?

57:04.455 --> 57:06.822
I'll take that as a yes.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.528
God, I'm hungry.

57:12.530 --> 57:14.530
I've got to watch
the cholesterol, though.

57:14.532 --> 57:16.765
You want to split
a chicken Caesar?

57:16.767 --> 57:20.068
I have some important information
for you, Mr. Miller,

57:20.070 --> 57:22.304
which may be
of interest to you.

57:22.306 --> 57:24.473
You're not one of those
Jesus guys, are you?

57:24.475 --> 57:25.808
Because it's not for me.

57:25.810 --> 57:27.910
You're in way over
your head, Mr. Miller,

57:27.912 --> 57:29.778
and you don't even know it.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.647
Is that so?

57:32.616 --> 57:34.383
You and your crew knocked off

57:34.385 --> 57:37.453
someone last night
for 80 large.

57:40.791 --> 57:44.493
Don't worry, it doesn't matter to
me how a man makes his living.

57:44.495 --> 57:47.162
Schmuck probably
had it coming to him.

57:47.164 --> 57:49.498
<i>It would be of no concern to me</i>

57:49.500 --> 57:52.434
except that the 80 grand
he lost was not his.

57:52.436 --> 57:54.403
It was his employer's.

57:54.405 --> 57:56.972
<i>And his employer</i>

57:56.974 --> 58:01.443
is a man by the name
of Mr. Malini.

58:01.445 --> 58:03.545
Does that name sound
familiar to you, Mr. Miller?

58:11.288 --> 58:14.623
"Malini."
Yeah, it rings a bell, yeah.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.992
Then now, perhaps, you realize

58:16.994 --> 58:20.095
the situation in which
you find yourself.

58:20.097 --> 58:22.698
Listen, I don't know
who the fuck you are,

58:22.700 --> 58:24.666
but let's just take
a couple of seconds here

58:24.668 --> 58:26.535
to pretend I know
what you're talking about.

58:26.537 --> 58:29.872
I ain't dumb enough
to play with mobbed-up money.

58:29.874 --> 58:32.474
No, not on purpose, no.

58:32.476 --> 58:35.878
But you see the problem,
it still remains.

58:36.814 --> 58:39.081
The money, Mr. Miller...

58:40.651 --> 58:42.284
Do you still have it?

58:43.554 --> 58:46.121
No, I don't.

58:46.123 --> 58:47.523
<i>It's all been divided up.</i>

58:47.525 --> 58:48.624
And how much do you have?

58:48.626 --> 58:51.827
Well, not much. I...

58:51.829 --> 58:54.196
Had some expenses.

58:56.734 --> 58:57.966
It's unfortunate.

59:01.972 --> 59:05.140
Yeah, I'm beginning to feel
that might be the case.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.808
And what about your crew...

59:06.810 --> 59:08.544
And Vernon?

59:12.249 --> 59:14.416
Listen, that 80 gs...

59:14.418 --> 59:15.884
no sweat to get it back.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.420
In fact, why don't you
tell Mr. Malini this...

59:18.422 --> 59:21.557
tell him to consider it
in the context of a loan

59:21.559 --> 59:24.426
and I'll keep the juice going,
give him an extra 20,000.

59:24.428 --> 59:27.896
Let's say, I'll have 100
grand in a couple of days.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.665
- Two days?
- Two days.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.034
- 100 grand.
- Mm-hmm.

59:32.036 --> 59:34.570
So you already
have your mark set up?

59:34.572 --> 59:38.106
Yeah, no sweat. No sweat.

59:38.108 --> 59:39.775
Hmm.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.878
I'll make sure that
I get the message out.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.580
You do that.

59:51.689 --> 59:54.056
- Oh, and one more thing.
- Oh, yeah, what's that?

59:54.058 --> 59:56.858
Give up smoking. It takes
years off your life.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.794
You know, it's funny
you should say that

59:58.796 --> 01:00:00.862
because I've been...

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:02.364
hey, Charlie.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:14.943
Fuck!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.712
Stained the fucking suit!

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.816
Fuck.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:34.496
Vernon, come on!

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.501
Come on, Charlie!

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:54.783
What the fuck was that about?!
Who were those guys?!

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.685
Muscle... muscle for malini.

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.654
- Malini?
- Yeah.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.690
Obviously Jennings was working for malini.
It wasn't his money to lose.

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:03.358
You think? Fuck!

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.494
You were supposed
to check him out.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:08.830
Oh, come on, Charlie. I knew he
was connected, but not <i> connected.</i>

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.332
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:13.035
Okay, okay, calm down.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.541
Good timing, t.,
saved our asses in there.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:23.945
Charlie: We just have to figure
out what to do next, that's all.

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:25.881
It's time to get
the hell out of dodge.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:27.015
- After the game.
- What?

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.384
- After the game.
- Are you insane?!

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:32.287
Malini's connected all over L.A., Vernon.
It's highway time.

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:33.689
We haven't gone
through all of this

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:36.525
not to play in that fucking game.
I'm playing in that game.

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:38.794
- You want to split? Feel free.
- Shut up!

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.996
Malini's never going
to find us that fast.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.065
All we got to do is lay low
for a bit, that's all.

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:44.399
Where?

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:49.037
Let's get cleaned up. I know
a place no one will look.

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.787
Open sesame.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:10.892
- You're kidding.
- No shit.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.729
It's the magic castle,
what do you want?

01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:19.835
There's no way malini's going
to find us in this place.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.903
It's kind of amazing.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.406
Yeah, I used to spend a lot of
time here before I met Charlie.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.608
Before I rescued you, you mean.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:32.881
You okay?

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:36.418
Well, yeah, other than
being shot at, I'm great.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.789
No, I mean, between you
and me, are we okay?

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:43.759
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:50.732
Look, after the game,

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:53.368
I'll talk to Charlie, okay?
We'll work it out.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.907
What the hell's
vice doing here?

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:01.276
You run out of hookers to bust?

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.645
Yeah, I...

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.814
I think the last one
I busted was your mama.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:08.884
Of course, don't worry,
she's out on bail.

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.652
- So who's this guy?
- <i> Not sure yet.</i>

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.821
<i>We think he's connected</i>
<i>to malini's crew.</i>

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.890
Witnesses?

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.958
The waitress in back.
She didn't see anything.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.827
People outside said they saw

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.829
three people tear ass out
of here just afterwards.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.831
<i>Two guys and a girl.</i>

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.301
Two guys and a girl?

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.139
Vernon: <i>Jesus, I
don't believe it.</i>

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.908
- What?
- Look.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:40.015
What the fuck
is he still doing here?

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:42.551
- Who?
- Professor.

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.987
Put the cards down.
Just put them down.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.023
Jesus, you have no idea
what you're doing.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:50.292
That's horrible.
Absolutely horrid.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:51.827
Go read eardonachs.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:54.296
- But I didn't get...
- No, no, it actually hurts me

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:55.797
to watch you hold a deck.

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:59.201
I suggest taking up a new
hobby like stamp collecting.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:01.970
So Professor,
what is the best advice

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.538
you've ever given a card man?

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.208
Sleep with as many
different women as possible.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:11.012
Hey, guys, what do you
think of this?

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.782
Not bad.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.118
Not bad.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.854
What do you think, Vernon?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:21.523
Well, the move is pretty open.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.992
It'll work here, but forget
about it at the card table.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.861
You need some kind of shade.

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:28.563
I'd say make the shift with one
hand as you ante with the other.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:33.535
That's good. Very good.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.872
Boys, I'd like you to meet
one hell of a card man.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:38.573
- This is Vernon.
- <i> Hey.</i>

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:40.942
Hey. Professor,
this is Tiffany.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:44.880
If I knew that hustling
had such benefits,

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.414
I never would have
gotten into magic.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.750
Why thank you.

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:50.886
- And you remember, uh...
- <i> Miller!</i>

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.888
Surprised you're still alive.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.090
Funny, I could've said
the same thing about you.

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:58.894
You still hustling old ladies out
of their social security checks?

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:01.730
Still pulling rabbits
out of hats, Professor?

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:04.699
Boys, entertain the lovely lady

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:06.668
while Vernon buys me a drink.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.504
Just don't pull any
rabbits out of your hats.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.941
- Been a while.
- <i> Quite a few years.</i>

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.110
What brings you here?

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:16.945
There's a big game
at the Roosevelt tonight.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.179
You boys are going to work?

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:20.515
Stevens is playing.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.517
- The Dean?
- <i> Yeah.</i>

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.352
Be careful, he's damn good.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.187
So are we.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:29.391
- Don't you mean <i> he?</i>
- No, I mean <i> we.</i>

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:31.426
<i>Who do you think got your</i>
<i>little magic boy here</i>

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.361
into someone who could
make a real living?

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:36.398
It hasn't hurt you
at all, has it?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.533
Vernon: <i>Give us a minute,
Charlie, will you?</i>

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:41.036
Look, there's some loose change
over there on the floor.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:43.905
Keep an eye on the clock, okay?

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:46.107
I want you to think

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.143
of any card in any
of the three rows.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.044
Okay.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:55.383
- You look a little haggard, son.
- <i> It's been a long week.</i>

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.752
Being on the grift
is a tough life.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.654
It can wear you down.
I've seen it before.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:01.656
I know, I know. You told me.

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:04.125
I'm not knocking
the profession, my boy.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.094
Hell, I've been friends

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.797
with most of the top
mechanics and hustlers

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.966
of the last century.

01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:12.767
I just hate to see
you go down that road,

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:14.803
especially with Miller.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:17.639
- He's not that bad.
- He's a street hustler...

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:20.909
Who's glommed onto you because
he sees you have talent

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:24.112
and he has none... other
than being a good liar.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:27.182
We made a good team. I mean,
what did you want me to do?

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:29.818
Make a grand or so a week
doing tricks for tourists?

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.086
I make that in one hand.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:33.088
Of course.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:36.091
You just have to make a choice.

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:38.093
At some point,

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:40.328
is it about the art,

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.896
or the money?

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:46.434
I remember when you and I
used to stay up all night

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.170
just discussing one move.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.740
Yeah, I miss that.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.642
I still don't have
the finger floater

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:57.445
on the bottom palm covered yet.

01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:00.115
We should work on that.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:03.118
You always know
where to find me.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.387
Resident legend, huh?

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:09.858
Ask yourself if this is
what you want to be doing

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.427
for the rest of your life.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.897
It gets harder every day

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:19.067
and every dollar to get out.

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:27.876
Just remember,

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:32.247
some things are
more important than money...

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:34.816
Vernon.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:42.157
I've known a lot of mechanics
and hustlers in my time,

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:44.225
but I've yet to meet
a retired one.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.615
Hello?

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.850
Man: <i>They're using
bee, red back.</i>

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.553
Nice work, j.J.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:06.841
I'm... I'm looking
for Mr. Hemingway.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.421
Try room 808.

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:23.024
Thank you.

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.563
We're in.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:36.703
- How do you feel?
- I'm good. I'm loose.

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:38.773
Okay, remember what I said...

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.009
play the man,

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.544
not just the cards.

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:45.013
Take your time. Be patient.

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.115
Quit it, Charlie. You're
making me nervous.

01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:49.149
No, nerves are good.
Keeps you sharp.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:52.420
Good. Ready to do this?

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.256
Okay, let's go.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.296
Can I help you?

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:02.664
I'm looking for Mr. Hemingway.

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:04.465
Please come in.

01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:08.403
Hey, now you
must be Mr. Holden.

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.737
That's right. How're you doing?

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:12.173
- How do you do?
- This is Miller.

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:14.309
- How are you?
- And this is Tiffany.

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:16.311
A genuine pleasure, ma'am.

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:19.714
- Thank you.
- I'm Tony d. From Austin, Texas.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.083
This good old boy
is Mr. Thornhill.

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:23.885
- Hey.
- Call me Jack.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.353
Hey, Jack.

01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.590
And if you'll allow me to introduce
you to our host this evening...

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.226
Mr. Malini.

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:35.396
Good of you
to join us, Mr. Holden.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.465
It's good of you to have me.

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:40.935
These are my friends.
They tend to bring me luck.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:43.504
Any problem
with them observing?

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:45.873
Not at all.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.709
<i>I hope this will prove to be</i>

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:50.311
an entertaining evening
for all of us.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.249
If you'll allow me to introduce
you to the other players?

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:03.391
You didn't know malini
was going to be here?

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.425
No idea.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.094
- Great.
- Stay cool.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.632
This is Mr. Stevens.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:12.467
<i>Mr. Stevens...</i>

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:14.435
Mr. Holden.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.406
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:20.541
I hear you're from
the Cincinnati area.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:22.377
Yeah, around there.

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:24.912
Then you must know
lady buck Johnson?

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:27.982
I've met her. I don't
really know her, though.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.984
Too bad about her
husband, isn't it?

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.657
I wasn't aware
that she was ever married.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.359
Oh, that's right.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:41.896
I don't remember
seeing you around the clubs

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:43.798
the last time I was
around Cincinnati.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.001
- I'm more or less a weekend player.
- Right.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.903
This is Tiffany.

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:51.406
Tiffany, very expensive name.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.775
Worth every penny.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:56.344
- This is Miller.
- Charlie, Charlie Miller.

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.146
Dean, good memory.

01:11:58.148 --> 01:11:59.314
You sitting in, Charlie?

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:02.116
Not me, no. I'm a dice man.

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.818
Really. Are you stake horsing?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.121
Well, yeah, I guess
something like that, yeah.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:08.623
You must be pretty good, kid,

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.358
if he's willing
to risk money on you.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.393
<i>Charlie's very conservative.</i>

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.363
You're not a hustler,
are you, kid?

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:23.137
What do you say, Max? Are we going
to start this thing or what?

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:25.073
Absolutely. Gentlemen.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.542
There you go.

01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:29.277
Can I get a receipt for that?

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:32.013
Yeah, after the game, dice man.

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:36.851
Malini: <i>Mr. Holden, take
your seat over there.</i>

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.724
Feel free to reload
at any point.

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:48.730
<i>If the Dean would</i>
<i>do us the honor?</i>

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:50.932
Sure, Max.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:26.768
Texas hold 'em, straight up.

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:28.436
Ante, gentlemen.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.510
Call.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.615
Ah, what the hell?

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.785
10 more.

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:45.953
I'll just take
one card, please.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:52.860
<i>I'm out.</i>

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.964
I'm in for a thousand.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.602
20 more.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.504
That's it for me.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.340
<i>Out.</i>

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:09.577
- Stevens: <i> Well, Tony?</i>
- <i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:13.381
<i>Okay, heck yeah, I'll call you.</i>

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.451
Let's see what you
got there, buddy.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.988
We got a big ouch.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.891
Heck yeah. I guess you
won that one, too.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.628
Tony: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:43.044
Something says five more.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.683
Yeah, I'll raise you
another 5000.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.751
My goodness, I'm getting
weak at the knees.

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:54.689
<i>Let's see if I can</i>
<i>dig down and get the courage</i>

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:56.958
to match that hefty wager.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.961
Stevens is going to go
for the kill on Tony d.

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.263
Why don't we make it...

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:04.665
50,000?

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.001
<i>That's 45,000 more.</i>

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:16.611
What do you think?

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:18.045
Malini: <i> Tony?</i>

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:23.017
Yes, um...

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:27.722
I don't think
I have that much...

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.291
With me.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.228
Stevens: <i>Really, Tony,
it's not that complicated.</i>

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.697
How much do you
think you have, Tony...

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.166
Anthony from Austin
or whatever...

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:43.304
in that little saddlebag
that you brought with you?

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.607
Well, let's see.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.545
Mm-hmm.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:55.583
I'm sure you got a few
more nuggets in that bag.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:59.554
It appears I only have 25,000.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.658
<i>Now I could be cruel,</i>

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.159
<i>but you would think badly of me</i>

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:07.662
if I just bought the pot.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:09.697
So Tony, since you flew in

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:11.599
and you look like a nice guy,

01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:14.502
<i>I am going to accept that bet.</i>

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:17.505
So 25,000 it is to you.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.781
I'm... I'm awfully sorry.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:35.690
What?

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.593
Oh, no.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.264
Easy, easy, cowboy.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:46.567
Back off, let's go.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:48.536
Bad manners, Tony.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:53.808
It appears my evening has drawn

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:57.612
to an embarrassingly
dramatic close.

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:00.881
Gentlemen...

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:03.618
Ma'am.

01:17:05.555 --> 01:17:06.954
Good night, Tony.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.464
Hundred thousand.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:18.733
I'm out.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:26.807
All in.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.412
I'll call.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.251
Trip 10s.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.487
- Sweet.
- As pie.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.490
But I've got the nuts.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:43.891
- Ace high.
- Son of a bitch!

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:47.662
Vernon: <i>Some luck.</i>

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:49.830
So much for my lucky hat.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.668
Well, gentlemen,
that's all for me.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.870
I think I'll
call it a night as well.

01:17:58.474 --> 01:17:59.807
Gentlemen.

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:02.109
Very impressive, kid.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.811
And then there was three.

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:05.780
My lucky number.

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:07.782
How about five-card stud
from here on out?

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:10.818
Music to my ears.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.887
Yeah, that sounds quaint.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.657
And how about a break?

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:18.526
What, are you tired?

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.897
<i>Just distracted, Cleveland.</i>

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:25.633
- Cincinnati.
- Sorry, same state.

01:18:25.635 --> 01:18:28.703
Back in 20 minutes, gentlemen.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.742
Man, am I glad you came by.

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:37.812
Like I said, I always
love to watch you play.

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.748
- I like that.
- <i> How's it going?</i>

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.683
I'm doing the obnoxious
bit with this kid.

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:44.518
Nothing seems to rattle him.
He's good.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.687
He's just very, very good.

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.556
As good as you?

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.258
Well, I didn't say that.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.461
Charlie, will you
fix me a drink?

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:03.671
- Mmm, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:05.506
<i>You want me to get you a drink?</i>

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.842
Yeah, I'd love a drink.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:22.089
Keep your mind
on the fuckin' game.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:23.290
Do you "folly"?

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:25.960
Hey, count the chips
on the table.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:33.033
- So how is he?
- He's really good.

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:35.970
I've double duped him a couple
of times and he won't bite.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:39.473
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:41.809
He's folded a few times
with bad hands.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:44.278
It's like he's
reading my cards.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.914
- So maybe he is.
- Marked cards? Come on.

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:49.283
The Dean's not going
to use paper in a real game.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.051
That's just
for hustles and squares.

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:52.920
You don't use it
in fast company.

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:55.189
Maybe he doesn't
consider you fast company.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.930
You know what? Let's find out.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:04.832
Come with me.

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:08.903
<i>I don't see any edgework,</i>
<i>sandwork,</i>

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:10.938
no shade or flash,

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.407
no block out or black line either.
It's clean.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.484
- Son of a bitch.
- Charlie: <i> What?</i>

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.921
It's juice. The bastard
is using a juice deck.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:28.489
Juice deck?

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:30.191
Yeah, look.
It's a way of marking cards

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.960
so you can only read it when
your eyes are out of focus.

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.695
Try it.

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:41.101
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:20:41.103 --> 01:20:43.704
I've only heard of juice decks.

01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:45.439
- So what now?
- <i> Now?</i>

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.441
I think the Dean
is about to take a fall.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.584
I think I'll quit
while I'm still behind.

01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:59.687
I guess it's just
you and me, Cincinnati.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.356
So romantic.

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:23.911
King speaks.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:35.256
4,000.

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.360
I like round numbers.
Let's make it 10.

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.895
King agrees.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:53.774
King says bet.

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:57.444
20.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.448
Make it 50.

01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:10.024
King likes that.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.933
Cowboy still thinks big.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.301
How's 100 grand sound?

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:40.988
Two.

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:45.392
Weekend player, huh?

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:04.244
Last time I recall,
ladies beat Jacks.

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:06.981
If that's all I have.

01:23:09.185 --> 01:23:11.018
Well, let's find out.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:16.156
<i>300,000.</i>

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:18.058
Starting to feel
like a healthy pot.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.033
500,000.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:40.748
I'm all in.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.137
I'm short... 50 grand.

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:07.107
- Really?
- Mmm.

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:11.912
Nothing ventured.
Nothing gained.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:21.088
That's 3-0. 30.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:27.561
Here's 20 more.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.235
It's good to have friends.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:36.804
You bet.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.440
All the way.

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:46.313
I'm looking for Mr. Hemingway.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:54.588
I don't know any Hemingway.
Sorry.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.290
Oh.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:59.393
Now you listen to me,
you son of a bitch,

01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:01.762
I'll squeeze your goddamn balls

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:04.298
till you shit in your britches.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.667
Now where's the goddamn game?

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:14.274
So let's see what you've
got up your sleeve, kid.

01:25:36.932 --> 01:25:38.265
- <i> Wait.</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:40.834
- <i> Come on.</i>
- These are the guys.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.736
- <i> What?</i>
- What is this?

01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:44.571
That's Vernon, Miller...

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:47.274
<i>these are the guys who
took Jennings for 80 g.</i>

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:48.809
I don't know you.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:50.811
- Hey! Hey!
- Not so fast, slick.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.347
- <i> Put down your gun.</i>
- You so much as move, your boss...

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.082
- drop the gun!
- Fuck you!

01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:57.151
- You're Vernon?
- <i> Malini, tell 'em to drop 'em.</i>

01:25:57.153 --> 01:25:59.019
- Drop it, sweetheart.
- Fuck you, man!

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:00.954
- Fuck you!
- Drop the fucking gun!

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:02.589
- Put the gun down.
- Charlie, shut up!

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:04.958
- <i> Put it down!</i>
- You see what I'm fucking doing?

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.194
- Be nice, lady.
- You're the Vernon from Kansas City?

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:08.428
What?

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:10.497
- Put it down now!
- Fuck you!

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.199
Watch your language.

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.201
Yeah? Eat my shit, asshole.

01:26:14.203 --> 01:26:15.936
Drop the fucking gun, bitch!

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:18.972
- I heard a lot about you.
- Thanks.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:20.641
- <i> Fuck you!</i>
- Put down the gun.

01:26:20.643 --> 01:26:22.109
Malini, tell him to drop it!

01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:24.278
- I hear you've been looking for me.
- Well...

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.480
- I guess you found me.
- Put it down!

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:38.525
Goddamn it, Charlie!

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:48.702
Hello.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:50.270
Yeah.

01:26:52.241 --> 01:26:55.142
No, I don't know anything
about a fucking ring.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:02.149
Things okay at home,
are they, Charlie?

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:05.419
Who the fuck is this?

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:08.989
Shit.

01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:10.657
Thank God, it's the police.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:12.893
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:16.763
- Who the fuck are you?
- Great timing, scarne.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:20.367
- Another friend?
- You have no idea.

01:27:20.369 --> 01:27:22.669
Max, why don't you
tell your boys to relax?

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:24.805
You can take care of him
after the game.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.544
Stevens: <i>All right.</i>

01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:33.580
Now I'm guessing that you and your
friends are completely tapped out

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.382
and I can buy this pot
for say, $10.

01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:37.117
Don't bet on it, sweetheart.

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:38.185
Tiff.

01:27:40.356 --> 01:27:42.956
Considering the circumstances,
I'll let it pass.

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.258
Let's see your card.

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.331
Do it, Vernon.

01:28:03.545 --> 01:28:05.012
Yes.

01:28:06.148 --> 01:28:08.015
Trip Jacks.

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:17.357
Hell of a hand, kid.

01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:19.493
You surprised?

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:22.496
You could say that.

01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:28.368
I guess I always knew
this day was gonna come.

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.009
It just ain't today.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.345
Three ladies.

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.019
No, no, no.
That's not possible.

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:49.022
Anything is possible.
Tough break, kid.

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.425
- What does that mean, Charlie?
- We're fucked.

01:28:51.427 --> 01:28:53.327
What does that mean, Charlie?

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:55.529
We're fucked.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:58.031
You're good, kid. Really,
you're very, very good.

01:28:58.033 --> 01:29:01.101
But as long as I'm around, you're
always gonna be second best.

01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:04.538
Jesus Christ.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.106
What did you do?

01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:13.046
Hey, you want to get that
thing away from me, please?

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:15.782
- <i> You're making me nervous.</i>
- You're making me nervous, too.

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:17.451
Not exactly a private
place for murder.

01:29:17.453 --> 01:29:19.353
Put it away.

01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:21.388
<i>Jennings was an idiot, anyway.</i>

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:24.191
I would, however,
strongly suggest

01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:26.393
the three of you
get out of the racket,

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:29.930
'cause if I see you again,
I won't see you again.

01:29:36.305 --> 01:29:38.472
About my cut...

01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:40.173
Forget it.

01:29:40.175 --> 01:29:41.775
Forget about it.

01:29:43.312 --> 01:29:46.980
You know, this almost
makes up for my leg.

01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:52.085
See you around...

01:29:52.087 --> 01:29:54.054
<i>Pros.</i>

01:29:58.427 --> 01:30:00.160
Nice play, Dean.

01:30:00.162 --> 01:30:02.329
- Here are your winnings.
- Thanks.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:07.000
I'll let you know when we
set another game, Dean.

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:09.703
Sure, Max, but this is
my last one for a while.

01:30:09.705 --> 01:30:12.339
- Eve.
- Good night.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:18.578
Hey, always reject
your hold cards.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.014
Hell, I was mucking cards
before you were born.

01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:30.524
The Dean, huh?

01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:33.794
Oy.

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:42.602
You know, it's probably
none of my business...

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:50.076
But Jennings never knew
he was being conned.

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:52.646
Shit.

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.583
Someone must've tipped us off.

01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:59.419
- Who is this?
- Seems one of your mules

01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:01.321
dropped 80 grand
on a poker hustle tonight.

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:04.257
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey!

01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:06.059
One more thing,

01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:07.394
if you want the cash back,

01:31:07.396 --> 01:31:10.664
you might want
to talk to a guy named...

01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:12.799
Charlie Miller.

01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:15.335
He'll be at a bar...

01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:20.841
Now.. Please,

01:31:20.843 --> 01:31:24.644
let us know if we can
be of some assistance.

01:31:42.598 --> 01:31:44.064
You got a cigarette?

01:31:48.303 --> 01:31:49.436
Thanks.

01:31:49.438 --> 01:31:54.074
$2 million. I can't believe it.

01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:58.111
You let $2 million
slip through your fingers.

01:31:58.113 --> 01:31:59.980
You fucked it.

01:31:59.982 --> 01:32:02.182
He outplayed me.

01:32:02.184 --> 01:32:04.184
Outplayed you?

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:07.654
Look, Charlie I'll make it up to you, okay?
The next time...

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:10.657
there isn't gonna be a next time.
Don't you get it?

01:32:10.659 --> 01:32:12.125
It's over.

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:14.027
I wash my hands of you.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:15.562
So that's it?

01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:18.965
That's it.

01:32:20.569 --> 01:32:23.436
Come on, baby, just leave him.

01:32:25.007 --> 01:32:27.040
Well, this is familiar.

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.376
Yeah, well, it's over.

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:35.715
Oh, yeah, it's over, baby.

01:32:48.931 --> 01:32:50.830
Wait a minute.

01:33:24.967 --> 01:33:28.201
<i>¶ Stormy weather ¶</i>

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:30.136
<i>¶ since me</i>
<i>and that little girl... ¶</i>

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:32.072
sir, I'm sorry,

01:33:32.074 --> 01:33:34.774
there's not supposed
to be any smoking in here.

01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:38.378
Hell with it.

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.715
Go ahead.
Stupid-ass law anyway.

01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:43.783
Thanks.

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:47.954
<i>¶ Life is bare ¶</i>

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:51.625
<i>¶ there's gloom</i>
<i>and misery everywhere ¶</i>

01:33:51.627 --> 01:33:54.661
<i>¶ stormy weather ¶</i>

01:33:54.663 --> 01:33:57.731
<i>¶ since me</i>
<i>and that little girl ¶</i>

01:33:57.733 --> 01:34:00.634
<i>¶ been together... ¶</i>

01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:01.968
good work, kid.

01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:05.338
Everything except for malini.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.140
Oh hell, there's
always complications.

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:08.842
Dealing with it is
what takes skill.

01:34:08.844 --> 01:34:11.745
<i>Which reminds me, it was a
good call bringing in scarne.</i>

01:34:11.747 --> 01:34:15.448
- Nice work there, John.
- My pleasure.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:17.317
Thanks for coming in, John.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:20.186
This actually does
make up for my leg.

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:24.324
Besides, I never liked
Miller or that broad.

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:26.860
Mean, mean...

01:34:29.798 --> 01:34:31.998
So did you get
your answer, kid?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.036
Unfortunately, yes.

01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:38.171
Oh, come on, anybody can
take a sucker.

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:39.839
That's what they're built for.

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:43.343
But to take down a pro... someone
who's wise, your partner...

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:44.878
now that's a real score.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.214
There's nothing more satisfying
than taking down your partner,

01:34:48.216 --> 01:34:50.116
especially when
they deserve it.

01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:53.453
Yeah, that they definitely did.

01:34:55.724 --> 01:34:58.892
So you really out?

01:34:58.894 --> 01:35:01.895
Oh, hell yeah.
Gotta go out sometime.

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:04.464
- Might as well be while you're on top, right?
- Right.

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:07.333
What about you? You
goin' back on the road?

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:09.836
Nah, I don't know
what I'm gonna do,

01:35:09.838 --> 01:35:12.205
but I'm finished for a while.

01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:14.708
It's too bad though.

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:16.443
Oh, why's that?

01:35:17.813 --> 01:35:20.513
We never got to sit
at a table for real.

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:23.149
Yeah, that is a shame.

01:35:24.853 --> 01:35:27.821
I always wondered
how it would turn out.

01:35:32.994 --> 01:35:35.361
I guess one of us
would have lost.

01:35:35.363 --> 01:35:37.230
I guess so.

01:35:43.672 --> 01:35:45.672
See you around, Vernon.

01:35:49.711 --> 01:35:51.311
Hey, Vernon...

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:11.965
see ya around, Dean.
