-DEE: Dennis.

00:05.918 --> 00:08.008
Wake up, buddy.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.053
Smell the stew, okay?

00:10.097 --> 00:14.449
Breathe in the arousing aromas

00:14.492 --> 00:16.886
of this delicious st--
Ah, screw it.

00:16.929 --> 00:20.498
-[screaming]
-[laughs]

00:20.542 --> 00:22.413
What the hell was that?
That's hot as shit.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.980
Yeah, yeah, that's
a whole bowl of stew

00:24.024 --> 00:25.329
you took right in the grill.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.549
See? It does wake people up.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.333
[grunts]

00:29.377 --> 00:31.509
Why am I in a hospital? [spits]

00:33.468 --> 00:35.861
And why is your head still on?
Did they reattach it?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.385
Left the skin
pretty loose, I see.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.039
You didn't behead me,
you stupid idiot.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.084
You had a 105-degree fever,

00:41.128 --> 00:42.738
and you were hallucinating.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.696
You were too weak
to even lift the ax.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.089
You did collapse
and shit yourself

00:46.133 --> 00:47.308
and stink up the whole castle.

00:47.351 --> 00:50.137
You know, Dee, I, uh...

00:50.180 --> 00:52.182
I'm starting to think
I might have had COVID.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.097
-Oh, yeah? You think?
-Yeah.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.186
Mr. Reynolds, you're finally up.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.666
What is that?

00:57.709 --> 01:00.321
-It's stew.
What's the update, man?
-Stew.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.714
Uh, okay. How are we feeling?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.890
Uh, outraged, violated,

01:04.934 --> 01:06.936
disgusted at the looseness
of my sister's neck,

01:06.979 --> 01:08.416
covered in stew,

01:08.459 --> 01:10.809
dragged from my castle
to a dingy hospital

01:10.853 --> 01:12.768
where I'm about to be saddled
with an enormous bill.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.726
Well, there is no bill.
It's free.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.032
Ireland has public health care.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.990
Oh, well, then that'll be fine.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.209
It's free, huh?

01:19.253 --> 01:22.038
Well, then maybe I ought
to get my neck done.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.214
[laughter]

01:24.258 --> 01:25.824
Yeah, your sister's a stitch.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.565
Oh, yeah?
Have you heard the one

01:27.609 --> 01:29.524
about the hot Irish doctor
who has a fling

01:29.567 --> 01:31.482
with the hilarious
American tourist?

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
'Cause I could give you
the punch line

01:33.180 --> 01:34.833
over drinks tonight, my place.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.314
Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Sounds great.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.099
-Tonight it is.
-[Irish brogue]: Tonight it is.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.191
Looks like mama's about to have

01:44.234 --> 01:46.628
a little of the old
luck of the Irish.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.195
[laughs]

["Pot of Gold"
by Christopher Beaty playing]

02:09.085 --> 02:11.218
DEE: You know, I'm just so glad
you're feeling better,

02:11.261 --> 02:12.523
Dennis, I really am.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.090
Now, a couple quick things
about the castle,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.527
I do need you to clear out
of here for the night.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.703
-What?
-Mm.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.357
Dee, I haven't even begun
to do half the things

02:20.401 --> 02:21.532
I want to do with this castle.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.534
-Now you're asking me to leave?
-Yeah.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.188

-Oh, Christ!

02:25.232 --> 02:26.407

02:26.450 --> 02:28.539
-Christ. What is this?
-What are you doing?

02:28.583 --> 02:31.238
Just want to reconnect
with my kids.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.196
Not you so much, more Dennis.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.764
Like, you know,
father-son thing.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.635
I mean, you know, it's one of
the strongest bonds there is.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
-Come on. Give me a kiss.
-What are you doing?

02:40.464 --> 02:42.031
-A kiss? [stammers] No!
-Come on, give me a...
lean down, give me a kiss.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.728
Give your daddy a kiss.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.903
No, no! God. Get your lips
away from me, Frank.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.036
What?

02:47.079 --> 02:48.820
-Cut the bullshit.
What's your angle?
-What are you doing here?

02:48.864 --> 02:50.561
Charlie's got a new dad.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.520
A-a new dad?

02:52.563 --> 02:53.912
-Weird.
-Yeah.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.219
I want to humiliate the jerk.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.395
I want to send
his Irish ass packing.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.180
-He's jealous.
-Yeah.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.399
Okay, well, listen, I-I don't
have any interest in the, uh,

03:02.443 --> 03:04.662
interpersonal dynamics
between an old man

03:04.706 --> 03:07.230
and his
roommate/surrogate adult son,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.753
but if we can incorporate

03:08.797 --> 03:10.973
the castle into it
in some way, then I'm in.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.148
-Done.
-DEE: No.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.454
-No.
-Yes.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.238
Goddamn it, no!
You listen to me.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.676
This trip has been absolutely
ruined because of you, okay?

03:18.720 --> 03:21.505
And I have one chance tonight
to have a good time in Ireland,

03:21.549 --> 03:23.159
so here is what
is going to happen,

03:23.203 --> 03:25.683
I'm going to go down to the bog,
I'm going to gather peat moss

03:25.727 --> 03:27.903
to burn it to try
and get rid of the shit smell

03:27.946 --> 03:29.818
that Dennis stunk up
the castle with.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.342
Do not be here when I get back.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.691
Cool.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.174
[chuckles]

03:38.218 --> 03:39.393
She's... [chuckles]

03:39.436 --> 03:41.656
-Bent out of shape.
-Yeah.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.311
Well... just me and you, huh?

03:44.354 --> 03:47.139
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

03:47.183 --> 03:49.925
It's a little odd being
one on one, though, you know.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.274
I feel, I feel like
we usually have a buffer.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.449
Yeah.

03:53.711 --> 03:54.930
Yeah.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.806
GUS:
So, Mac,

04:01.850 --> 04:04.505
when did you hear the call
to become a priest?

04:04.548 --> 04:07.247
Oh, when God took away
my Irish identity

04:07.290 --> 04:10.989
and made me Dutch to smite me
for the urges that He gave me

04:11.033 --> 04:13.601
when I made the original sin
of being born.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.777
That's not the way
God works, Mac.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.605
He doesn't smite us.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.998
Yes, He does. Yes, He does.
Remember the flood

04:20.042 --> 04:21.609
that took out the whole world?

04:21.652 --> 04:23.567
Remember? Then-then-then
Noah made that ark,

04:23.611 --> 04:25.308
and he saved himself
but no women,

04:25.352 --> 04:27.005
-which was really cool.
-[both laugh]

04:27.049 --> 04:29.486
Not sure how he made
more people after that, though.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.879
Could've been
another rib situation.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.229
Either way, then God made
the Ark of the Covenant

04:33.273 --> 04:35.579
where he promised
to never, ever do it again.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.407
Then a bunch of people
looked at it.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.280
He didn't like that,
so he blasted them, too.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.412
Remember, the Nazis got
their faces all melted off,

04:42.456 --> 04:44.545
and the-the guy with the whip
and the hat, he was cool.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.722
I think you've mixed that
story up with Indiana Jones.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.550
Oh. I did?

04:49.593 --> 04:51.726
-Yeah, but listen...
-Oh.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.468
...many of the stories
in the Bible are metaphors.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.731
Parables with lessons.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.820
What's the lesson of the
last one? Don't look at my shit?

04:58.863 --> 05:00.561
Look, you're looking at this
all wrong.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.780
The Bible is a guidepost.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.913
Interpretations
can change over time.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.349
They can?

05:06.393 --> 05:08.351
Yes, and so can the Church.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.223
Our God, the God we teach here,

05:11.267 --> 05:12.964
is a merciful God.

05:13.008 --> 05:16.054
One that loves us
for exactly who we are.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.318
Otherwise, why would He have
made us that way

05:18.361 --> 05:19.667
in the first place?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.277
[chuckles]

05:21.321 --> 05:23.018
Yeah.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.150
Yeah. Wow.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.413
Thanks, Gus.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.892
SHELLEY:
That's John Patrick Kelly.

05:27.936 --> 05:28.980
Killed by the plague.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.028
And his son William,
also the plague.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.291
And Michael Kelly.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.727
He was attacked
by the village loon,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.686
became a loon himself.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.819
He died from eating rocks,
which he thought were eggs.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.822
Oof. [laughs] Yeah,
I've made that mistake, yeah.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.259
So, are all
the Kellys buried here?

05:47.303 --> 05:48.870
Uh...

05:48.913 --> 05:51.829
Honored, yes. Buried, no.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.223
They were all thrown
from a cliff into the sea.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.878
You see, legend has it

05:56.921 --> 05:59.315
that only when a man is thrown
from a cliff into the sea,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.622
may his soul be released.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.233
-Huh.
-When I pass, I'll have
the same done for me.

06:04.276 --> 06:07.628
All Kelly men must be thrown
from a cliff into the sea.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.586
Wow.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.761
-That's pretty cool.
-Yeah.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.067
Yeah. What about the women?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.808
Oh, the women are thrown
from a cliff as well.

06:13.851 --> 06:14.939
Mostly alive.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.420
[stammers] Just to see
if they can fly,

06:17.464 --> 06:19.248
as they're presumed
to be witches.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.119
Right. Right.

06:21.163 --> 06:24.079
Well, we...
we honor their spirits.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.908
Ah, yes, their spirits
watch over us. The men, that is.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.083
Ah.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.346
The women roam the land

06:30.390 --> 06:32.827
as terrible hags and banshees

06:32.870 --> 06:36.308
whose wailing warns
of impending death.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.919
If you ever see

06:37.962 --> 06:39.399
a gruesome woman

06:39.442 --> 06:41.313
covered in filth

06:41.357 --> 06:43.054
with long, stringy hair,

06:43.098 --> 06:45.448
who's horribly shrieking

06:45.492 --> 06:47.276

06:47.319 --> 06:48.669
the end is near.

[sighs]

06:51.062 --> 06:52.324
Whoa.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.938
I mean, how am I supposed
to know what peat is?

06:56.981 --> 07:00.071
What am I, a botanist?

07:00.115 --> 07:02.204
Hey-o. I'll burn you.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.467
Be like lighting a match.
That works.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.168
Hey-o. That's my guy.

07:10.212 --> 07:13.041
A selfie, huh? You got it.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.912
[phone camera clicks]

07:14.956 --> 07:17.045
Oh, goddamn it.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.134
Dennis got me all worked up
about my neck.

07:19.177 --> 07:22.180
Here.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.443
[phone camera clicks]

07:23.486 --> 07:24.966
I mean, that's just insane.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.446
Maybe if I stand back
a little bit.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.798
Let's see here.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.279
-Oh!

07:44.202 --> 07:47.031
Oh... Help!

07:47.075 --> 07:48.032
Dennis!

07:48.076 --> 07:50.165
Um, I...

07:50.208 --> 07:52.297
This is crazy,
but I think I'm stuck.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.473
[bog bubbling]

07:53.516 --> 07:55.300
Am I sinking?

07:55.344 --> 07:56.563
Oh, shit, I'm sinking.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.697
Yes.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.657
Yes.

08:03.700 --> 08:04.919
You're right.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.964
Huh? Who you talking to?

08:07.008 --> 08:09.358
Hmm? Oh, uh, nothing.
It's just the-the castle.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.620
The castle?

08:10.664 --> 08:11.839
-Oh.
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.623
-Yeah, no.
-Okay, we've got it.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.886
-What?
-It'll be a dinner.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.541
-Hmm?
-A banquet of humiliation.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.936
Wait a minute.
The old turd in the soup trick.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.720
-What? No. We're not...
-Turd in the soup.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.070
We're not putting a turd
in someone's soup, Frank, okay?

08:26.114 --> 08:28.464
Can we be a little bit more
sophisticated than that?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.989
All right, so you invite them
to a classy dinner.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.600
You wine and dine the man

08:33.643 --> 08:36.037
while also pointing out
all of his character flaws,

08:36.080 --> 08:37.604
and then you lure him over

08:37.647 --> 08:40.258
to the castle's murder hole.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.565
Is that like a-a glory hole?

08:42.609 --> 08:45.046
A predecessor to
the glory hole, perhaps.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.439
It's a discreet opening
concealed in plain sight,

08:47.483 --> 08:48.615
except, instead of for sex,

08:48.658 --> 08:51.618
it's used for murder.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.098
-[laughs]
-[whoops]

08:54.142 --> 08:55.535
-You didn't see that there,
did you?
-No.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.624
No. [laughs] Yeah, so you'll

08:57.667 --> 08:59.190
lure him under the hole,

08:59.234 --> 09:01.192
where I will, uh,
douse him with boiling oil

09:01.236 --> 09:04.979
or hot tar or really
any scalding substance.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.676
Wait, you're gonna char the guy?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.112
[laughs]
Yeah.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.549
-Gonna char him up?
-Yeah.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.028
I'm not gonna kill him
or anything, but it's-it's

09:11.072 --> 09:12.290
got to be hot enough
to be annoying as shit, right?

09:12.334 --> 09:13.422
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. Burn him.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.815
Uh, he's gonna get burned.

09:14.858 --> 09:15.990
But, I mean, Charlie's got
to see him lose his cool,

09:16.033 --> 09:17.469
so we can expose him

09:17.513 --> 09:19.471
as the child-abandoning monster
that he really is.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.648
-Exactly.
-Oh, FYI,

09:21.691 --> 09:24.041
I'll know exactly when to pour
the boiling substance on him

09:24.085 --> 09:26.957
because I'm going to be hiding
in this passageway here.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.872
I'm gonna take this painting,

09:28.916 --> 09:30.352
cover up the passageway.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.397
I'm gonna cut out the eyeholes

09:32.441 --> 09:34.704
so I can see everything
that's happening.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.053
That's something
I've always wanted to do,

09:36.097 --> 09:38.229
and it fully takes advantage
of the castle.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.101
It also happens to be
the castle's preference

09:40.144 --> 09:42.625
for how this
is all gonna go down.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.974
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.585
Wow. I wouldn't have been able

09:45.628 --> 09:47.543
to think of this
all by myself. I...

09:47.587 --> 09:48.979
I mean... You know,

09:49.023 --> 09:51.852
the sickness and anger
inside of you is diabolical.

09:51.895 --> 09:55.551
-Way to go, son.
-Well...

09:55.595 --> 09:58.032
I suppose all of your years
of neglect

09:58.075 --> 10:00.164
and misdeeds

10:00.208 --> 10:02.558
have allowed me to harness
the darkness inside me

10:02.602 --> 10:04.908
and to unleash it

10:04.952 --> 10:07.563
without conscience, so...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.610
Yeah, perhaps I owe you a...

10:10.653 --> 10:13.525
thanks for making me the man
I am today, Frank. Thank you.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.876
You're welcome.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.226
Yeah, y...
Maybe I'll just, um...

10:25.233 --> 10:26.495
-There.
-Oh.

10:26.538 --> 10:29.585
Was that okay to do?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.022
Yeah, it was nice.

10:32.066 --> 10:35.417
Good.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.027
So, you're telling me

10:37.071 --> 10:38.420
that the whole
Cain and Abel thing

10:38.463 --> 10:39.421
didn't actually happen?

10:39.464 --> 10:40.596
Metaphor.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.424
This is all so confusing.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.121
Yes, look... [sighs]

10:44.165 --> 10:47.429
Our faith is...
it's complicated.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.083
Can I admit something?

10:49.126 --> 10:52.652
You said you were, you were
born a certain way.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.784
-You're... different.
-Mm-hmm.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.134
You have urges that,
traditionally,

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
the Church has been
very clear about.

10:59.746 --> 11:00.747
Well...

11:00.790 --> 11:03.488
I have those urges, too.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.708
-You do?
-Yes.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.232
I, too, have an eye
for the lads.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.453
It's not uncommon.
There's nothing wrong with it.

11:11.496 --> 11:14.282
It's who He made us.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.719
But, uh, our path,

11:16.763 --> 11:19.461
this path, is very clear.

11:19.504 --> 11:22.333
We must never act
on those urges.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.467
[sighs] That's gonna be
really hard for me.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.295
That's what he said.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.905
[both laugh]

11:28.949 --> 11:30.733
That's-that's really good.

11:30.777 --> 11:31.691
Thank you. I'm sorry.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.910
It just slipped out.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.259
-That's what he said.
-[both laughing]

11:35.303 --> 11:37.653
Shh! Shh.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.741
Sorry.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.091
Sorry.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.571
Help!

11:42.614 --> 11:44.704
Oh, God, help.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.183
-WOMAN: Hello?
-Hello!

11:46.227 --> 11:48.795
-Hello?
-H-Hello!

11:48.838 --> 11:51.362
-Hello...
-W-W-Waitress?

11:51.406 --> 11:53.756
Oh... my God.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.845
What the hell
are you doing out here?

11:55.889 --> 11:59.501
What are you doing out here
with a toiletry bag?

11:59.544 --> 12:01.633
Are you gonna brush your teeth
in a stream or something?

12:01.677 --> 12:04.375
No. I was gonna shave my legs.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.464
Ew. Gross.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.772
Um, hey, can you help a girl out
and then get me of this bog?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.121
Are you stuck in there?

12:11.165 --> 12:12.775
Yeah.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.472
-[both laugh]
-I know.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.996
I also seem to be sinking.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.214
-And, uh... I know.
-Uh-oh.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.650
And I-I-I have a date tonight

12:18.694 --> 12:19.956
with a real hot Irish doctor.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.392
Is he meeting you here, or...?

12:23.264 --> 12:25.788
You got me. No, no.
He's meeting me out there.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.094
-I bet.
-So that's why I want

12:27.137 --> 12:28.878
to get out of here.
I also don't want to die,

12:28.922 --> 12:30.358
but, either way, could you p--
just give me a big tug,

12:30.401 --> 12:31.838
and I bet you could get me out.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.014
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here.
I got you. Let me just...

12:34.057 --> 12:36.538
-[sighs] You're a livesa...
-Grab my hand, and I'll-- Psych!

12:38.018 --> 12:40.411
-[laughs]
-"Psych"?

12:40.455 --> 12:43.501
-Your face. I'm kidding.
No, I got you.
-Okay.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.329
-Psych! [laughing]
-Oh...

12:45.373 --> 12:46.853
Two times.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.290
-I will get you.
-Hey, uh, well, just quick tip

12:49.333 --> 12:51.161
for you, nobody does "psych"
anymore. It's kind of dumb.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.728
-Oh, do they not?
-Nah, it's not funny, it's dumb.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.861
-I feel like it's classic.
I-I got you.
-Oh, you got me.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.427
-You got me.
I got you, and you got me.
-I got you.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.777
Okay.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.517
It's fun.
All right, here we go. Psych!

12:59.561 --> 13:01.737
Oh, my God. Just--
Come on. Knock it off.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.565
Cut the shit.
Get me out of here.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.175
I will, I will, I will.
All you have to do is one thing.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.090
Yes. Great. What?

13:07.134 --> 13:09.310
Say my name.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.573
Hmm?

13:11.616 --> 13:14.228
Just say my name. What is it?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.711
Oh, o... kay, yeah.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.844
Yeah, yeah.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.150
-It's-- That's easy.
-Okay.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.108
Just, just give me,
give me a second.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.197
GUS:
Well, Mac, this is it.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.547
The end of a typical day
in my life.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.636
It's modest, pious,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.160
and somewhat dull,

13:33.203 --> 13:36.554
but I can't imagine my life
any other way. [chuckles]

13:36.598 --> 13:38.600
-What do you think?
-Gus,

13:38.643 --> 13:40.689
knowing that there's
somebody here

13:40.732 --> 13:44.388
that's exactly like me
gives me the courage

13:44.432 --> 13:47.435
to-to want to do it, too,
so tomorrow

13:47.478 --> 13:49.698
I am going to join the seminary.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.222
Grand! I am so happy for you.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.573
And I must admit,
I'm happy for myself, too.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.966
Having someone here

13:57.010 --> 13:59.055
who knows how I feel
will help keep me

13:59.099 --> 14:01.101
-on the straight and the narrow.
-Yes.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.233
And no matter how strong
those urges get,

14:03.277 --> 14:05.105
and they will be strong,

14:05.148 --> 14:06.497
we must never, ever
give in to them

14:06.541 --> 14:07.934
because we would get
kicked out of the Church.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.283
-Good, good.
-Yes.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.024
And we'll never, ever
leave each other alone

14:11.067 --> 14:12.764
in the room with the wee lads.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.071
Yes, and I also think...

14:15.115 --> 14:16.290
Wait, what?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.509
Or the wee lasses,
whatever you're into.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.294
There's no judgment here.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.731
And, of course, you know,
if you do slip up,

14:22.774 --> 14:25.081
you'll go to a new parish,
they sort the family out,

14:25.125 --> 14:27.214
have some chats, perhaps
some money changes hands,

14:27.257 --> 14:29.085
perhaps not. No harm, no foul.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.044
You come back, you're grand.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.959
Uh...

14:33.002 --> 14:35.352
Yeah, I'm gay.
What are you talking about?

14:37.964 --> 14:40.705
Oh...

14:40.749 --> 14:42.751
No. I'm gay. That's it.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.405
I'm a gay man.

14:44.448 --> 14:48.104
I'm a gay man who has trouble
controlling his...

14:48.148 --> 14:50.628
urges with other

14:50.672 --> 14:52.761
gay adult men,

14:52.804 --> 14:54.894
and that's the end of it.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.985
[sighs] Goddamn it.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.727
[knocking]

15:04.599 --> 15:07.384
Ah, welcome, welcome.
Come in, come in.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.734
-You're leaving us waiting
out there forever.
-No, no, no. Come on in.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.476
Welcome, welcome.
Shirley, let me take your coat.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.826
Frank, his name is Shelley,
okay? You know this.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.437
And you couldn't take
his coat if you tried, dude,

15:16.480 --> 15:17.655
'cause it's buttoned
to his pants

15:17.699 --> 15:18.961
in traditional Irish style.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.616
I'm not wearing a coat.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.705
Right, he's not even
wearing a coat, man.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.750
All right, look, we brought
you this. We made it ourselves,

15:25.794 --> 15:27.361
-with love.
-Mm.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.972
You made cheese together?

15:30.016 --> 15:31.974
Uh, well, personally,

15:32.018 --> 15:34.237
I think cheese should be
sprayed out of a can,

15:34.281 --> 15:35.804
but to each his own.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.458
Yeah, well, normally
I would agree with you, Frank,

15:37.501 --> 15:39.416
but Shelley's really opened
my eyes to a whole new world.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.028
Oh, yeah? Well, that can
be very blinding.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.073
But I'm sure,
by the end of the evening,

15:44.117 --> 15:46.467
we'll all be seeing clear.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.122
Let's sit down.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.907
I don't like how you said that.
I don't like how he said that.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.387
-Ah, yeah.
-Wow.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.997
-Well, come on in.
-Cool.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.477
-Wow. Okay.
-Yeah.
-Very nice.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.001
Put it right there.
Welcome. Sit down there.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.698
-Went all out, huh?
-Shirley, you over there.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.526
-Charlie, there.
-Here?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.006
Welcome,
and thank you all for coming.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.617
You know, it's been
a very trying time

16:06.661 --> 16:09.969
with Charlie finding
his biological father,

16:10.012 --> 16:11.883
who abandoned him
when he was a child, by the way.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.756
Not judging, just the facts.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.540
Okay, I can't really read the
tone of this dinner, you know?

16:16.584 --> 16:17.715
It's very confusing.
You're being mean,

16:17.759 --> 16:18.890
you're being nice.
What are you doing?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
No, no, I-I want everybody
to be happy.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.634
In fact, in the spirit of that,
I bought everybody a gift.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.768
So, just look under
your seats, and you'll see

16:26.811 --> 16:29.075
a nice gift for you.
Uh, Shelley, you go first.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.251
-Oh.
-Oh, wow.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.774
-Yeah.
-Okay.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.819
Very nice.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.214
Swim goggles?

16:38.258 --> 16:40.173
Yeah, they're good ones, too.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.740
They'll protect your eyes
from any chlorine

16:42.784 --> 16:45.004
or oils or any other hot liquid

16:45.047 --> 16:47.006
that might come in contact
with your face.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.746
That's, that's very kind
of you, Frank, yeah, thanks.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.574
Yeah, Frank, I'm not seeing
a present for me.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.054
No, no, no. [stammers]

16:52.098 --> 16:53.708
Just the one gift,
just for Shelley.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.058
Eat up. Yeah. [stammers]

16:56.102 --> 16:58.234
Eat it while it's hot. It's, uh,

16:58.278 --> 17:00.410
it's, uh, butternut squash soup.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.151
And for the special guest,

17:02.195 --> 17:03.892
there's a couple meatballs
in there.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.763
DENNIS:
Didn't put any goddamn meatballs
in that soup.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.462
-Do you hear something?
-Yeah.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.334
Oh, it's probably your stomach
grumbling from hunger.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.032
Eat up before they get cold.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.468
Oh, why don't I get
any meatballs?
