00:03.440 --> 00:04.720
[Danny] Evening, Steven.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.040
Lot to get through, yeah?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.039
How much? What the hell is this?

00:08.119 --> 00:10.480
Sat Nav for the elderly.
It's a new option they're offering.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.840
Sat Nav?

00:11.920 --> 00:13.880
Is that the client's name?
That sounds Indian.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.160
So, I'm guessing that's you?

00:16.920 --> 00:17.960
Not quite, Steven.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.120
Sat Nav is the brand name
of a voiced automated travel service.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.360
-You what?
-Audio travel information.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.240
As you can see, Steven, there's a lot
to get through. So let's crack on.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.320
Yeah? May be a long night.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.200
Hello, Steven.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.520
-This is Clem Fandango. Can you hear me?
-Here we go.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.080
-Steven?
- Yeah, I can hear you, Clem Fandango!

00:38.160 --> 00:39.800
There's over 700 pages in front of you.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.720
The sooner we start,
the sooner we can sign off.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.960
Well, stop talking then, you silly prick!

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
[whispers] God!

00:48.680 --> 00:50.760
-Are we rolling?
-All good, buddy.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.000
[Toast] You are now turning into...

00:53.080 --> 00:57.640
Abbotsbury... Abingdon...

00:58.280 --> 00:59.720
Acton...

01:00.360 --> 01:04.319
Albrighton... Alcester...

01:04.400 --> 01:09.320
Alford... Almouth... Alnwick...

01:09.400 --> 01:14.400
Alston... Aylsham... Amersham...

01:14.840 --> 01:16.200
Andover...

01:16.280 --> 01:18.160
Accrington...

01:18.240 --> 01:19.800
Aylesham...

01:21.200 --> 01:22.360
Ashbourne...

01:23.400 --> 01:27.440
Ascot... Ashburton...

01:27.520 --> 01:29.800
Axminster...

01:29.880 --> 01:31.920
[cockerel crows]

01:32.000 --> 01:33.240
[yawns]

01:33.320 --> 01:34.800
St. Albans...

01:35.360 --> 01:37.800
St. Leonards Warrior Square...

01:37.880 --> 01:40.640
St. Peter Port...

01:40.720 --> 01:41.960
Who the hell are you?

01:42.960 --> 01:45.520
[exhales] St. Saviour...

01:46.320 --> 01:48.240
What the hell's the time? Fuck this.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.960
[yawns]

02:15.040 --> 02:18.360
And you must be looking forward
to going back into the West End again.

02:18.440 --> 02:22.520
Yes. Uh, it's a legendary play. I mean,
there can't be many theater goers

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
who haven't heard of  The Moosetrap.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.160
How long has it been running?

02:29.760 --> 02:33.560
Sixty years.
And uh, still attracting huge audiences.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.600
That is such a long time.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.760
What do you think
is the secret to its success?

02:38.320 --> 02:41.600
Well, it's a good old-fashioned
murder mystery, really.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.840
-Right.
-It's well plotted.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.200
And the fact that the chauffeur
is the murderer

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
is very cleverly concealed
from the audience,

02:48.560 --> 02:50.440
with a series of delicious red herrings.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.440
-The chauffeur did it?
-The chauffeur is the murderer, yes.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.560
Well,  The Moosetrap's  running
in the West End until forever really.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.760
So, do go along and you'll see
our special guest, Mr. Steven Toast.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.080
Thanks for coming in, Steven.
Well, thank you.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.720
And I hope I don't come across
as crude by saying this,

03:06.800 --> 03:08.520
but you really are sex on legs.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.760
You should be on the TV,
where more people can see you.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.080
I don't suppose you fancy going
for a drink, do you? Hm?

03:18.880 --> 03:20.000
[sighs]

03:22.120 --> 03:25.280
[yawns]

03:25.360 --> 03:27.440
Had a hell of a morning, Jane.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.040
I was up all night doing that voiceover.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.320
Then I went and did the radio interview.
I was quite pleased with myself.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.920
And then, I went to The Colonial Club

03:36.000 --> 03:37.920
and, for some reason,
nobody would talk to me.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.200
I was up most of the night too, Toast,

03:41.280 --> 03:43.960
cleaning this collection
of antique firearms.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, what the hell is it with all that?
Where did you get them from?

03:47.080 --> 03:49.520
Michael Winner loaned them to me.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.000
Kind of stuck with them now,
since he's dead.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.880
And then this morning,
I heard your interview.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.840
You know that play's
been running for... 60 years?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.960
-Yes.
-And in all that time, no one,

04:03.040 --> 04:07.080
not one single person,
has revealed the climax of the play

04:07.160 --> 04:09.040
where the murderer is unmasked.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.320
Yes.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.360
But today, live on  Woman's Hour,
you revealed the name of the murderer.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
Yes.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.720
You see what you've done, Toast.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.399
Yes.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.600
Think of the implications for a moment.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.600
-Yes.
-Well?

04:27.520 --> 04:28.520
Oh, God.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.640
What are the implications?

04:32.600 --> 04:36.680
The implications are that,
as a result of your actions this morning,

04:36.760 --> 04:41.640
no director, or actor for that matter,
will ever want anything to do with you.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.800
Well, that's why people weren't talking
to me in The Colonial Club earlier.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.000
Anyone see Mark Rylance
on  The Culture Show  last night?

04:49.720 --> 04:53.040
-What's that smell, Royce? It's dreadful.
-Smell, Purchase?

04:53.120 --> 04:57.240
Yes. It smells like someone's
just fucked up their career!

04:57.320 --> 05:00.280
[laughter]

05:02.200 --> 05:05.040
[laughter continues]

05:09.760 --> 05:12.040
You were being shunned, Toast.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.600
-Shunned?
-Yes.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.280
You've done something really dreadful,
by giving away the end of that play.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.160
The Colonial is an actors' club.
They were quite right to shun you.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.960
It's not nice being shunned.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.280
Luckily, shunning doesn't last long.
You can go back in a couple of days.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.040
But, anyone who wanted to see
that  Moosetrap  play,

05:30.120 --> 05:33.480
probably won't bother now,
because you told them who the murderer is.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.280
No, no, Jane. It's like that  Titanic  film.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.680
Everyone knew
what was gonna happen in the end,

05:39.760 --> 05:41.160
but it was still a tremendous hit.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.520
This is very different, Toast.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.560
Honestly, Jane, I don't think anybody's
going to agree with you about this.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.080
It's like that  Titanic  film.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.360
Everyone knew
what was gonna happen in the end,

05:52.440 --> 05:55.720
-but it was still a tremendous hit.
-This is very different, Toast.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.200
Honestly, Davison, I don't think anybody's
going to agree with you about this.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.360
It's like that  Titanic  film.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.720
Everyone knew
what was gonna happen in the end,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.400
but it was still a tremendous hit.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.880
This is very different, Toast. Oh!

06:08.960 --> 06:13.320
Honestly, Mrs. P, I don't think anybody's
going to agree with you about this.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.000
It's like that  Titanic  film.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.120
Everyone knew
what was gonna happen in the end,

06:17.200 --> 06:18.680
but it was still a tremendous hit.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.200
This is very different, Toast.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.840
[sighs] To be honest, Ed,
a few people have said that to me now.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.840
It's quite serious, to give away
the ending of such a legendary play.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.600
It probably doesn't matter much
to the cast. They've been in it for years.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.640
Completely zombified, going through
the motions. But 60 years?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.680
-Can you imagine?
-[exhales]

06:43.080 --> 06:44.760
-[snoring]
-I say?

06:45.960 --> 06:47.520
-[snoring continues]
-Hello?

06:49.480 --> 06:51.720
-Hello?
-[man stirs]

06:52.200 --> 06:53.360
Oh.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.120
I'm Steven Toast.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.760
Ah.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.720
I'm playing the detective.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.240
[shouts] Who? Oh, yes!
Our new cast member. [laughs]

07:03.320 --> 07:07.160
I'm... I'm Ken Suggestion.
Good to meet you, Post.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.680
No, no, Toast.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.800
Philip, dear?
Philip, this is our new cast member, Post.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.040
-[sighs]
-As in deaf as a...

07:16.120 --> 07:18.760
And I'm Penny Traitor.

07:18.840 --> 07:23.520
-Is the producer or director around?
-Sorry?

07:23.600 --> 07:28.680
The producer or director?
Are they around?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.240
No, no. It's just us, I'm afraid.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.240
Well, who takes charge of rehearsals?

07:35.320 --> 07:36.800
Rehearsals?

07:36.880 --> 07:39.920
-Well, I haven't even been sent a script.
-[Ken] Oh. Well...

07:40.000 --> 07:43.080
There may be a copy of the play

07:43.160 --> 07:44.560
lying around somewhere.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.120
Who... Who would have one?

07:46.200 --> 07:50.720
-Albert may have a copy.
-Yes, yes. Uh...

07:50.800 --> 07:52.120
Is he around?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
[whispers] Oh, fuck...

07:53.480 --> 07:55.720
-Oh, I don't...
-Albert! [coughs]

07:55.800 --> 07:56.960
Albert!

07:58.320 --> 07:59.680
-What news?
-What?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.680
Of the outside world?

08:01.760 --> 08:04.080
We're a bit isolated in here.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.520
Oh. Oh, right.
Well, um, David Cameron is still PM.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.120
Not that you'd notice.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.320
I mean, I can't even remember
what he looks like. [laughs]

08:15.400 --> 08:17.800
-Who?
-Really?

08:18.680 --> 08:22.280
-Any sign of that script?
-Yes, here's Albert now.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.320
[spooky music]

08:27.200 --> 08:30.520
Do you have a copy of the play
for Post here?

08:35.520 --> 08:36.600
[Ken] Thank you, Albert.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.039
Right.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.160
[Toast] The play's awful,

08:45.240 --> 08:47.640
but, luckily, I don't appear
until the third act.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.240
when I quickly solve the murder.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.840
Yes, and you know who did it?
The chauffeur!

08:51.920 --> 08:53.520
We all know that now, thanks to you.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.840
-All right!
-Anyway...

08:55.480 --> 08:57.200
Looking forward to seeing the play again.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.360
What a relief to see a show
that isn't full of bad language,

09:01.440 --> 09:03.960
immigrants and sex-change artists.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.080
Unlike most modern dramas,
it isn't set in the North.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.240
Glorifying the type of scroungers
one sees on  Benefits Street.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.920
And I don't even have to follow
the plot or anything,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.920
-because I know the chauffeur did it.
-All right, Blair, keep it down!

09:16.000 --> 09:20.680
[chuckles]
Still, a regular job for you, Toast.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.400
Play your cards right, you could be in
gainful employment for the next 30 years.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.600
-[laughs]
-[laughs sarcastically]

09:28.920 --> 09:31.360
Where the bloody hell is he?
Not like him to be late.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
Ah! There he is.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.720
-Who the fuck is that?
-Dennis Thwaites.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.560
Retired commander of
the Household Cavalry Regiment.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.680
Still likes to wear the uniform.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.320
Dennis, good to see you.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.640
Gin, tonic!

09:46.360 --> 09:49.200
Uh, no, Dennis. This chap isn't a waiter.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.360
-He's my brother.
-Why does he think I'm a waiter?

09:52.440 --> 09:53.800
'Cause you bloody look like one.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.240
A lot of people have remarked on it.
It's the tache.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.160
-Thwaites, Dennis!
-This is Steven Toast.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.000
-Toast, Steven!
-Toast, Blair!

10:02.080 --> 10:03.480
Ah! [laughs]

10:03.560 --> 10:06.000
-[Blair and Dennis laugh]
-[Blair clears throat]

10:07.000 --> 10:09.160
[Blair] How was your journey
from Ipswich, Dennis?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.720
Come down on Farage, did you?

10:11.120 --> 10:13.480
-On who?
-Farage, Dennis's horse.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.000
What, did he ride a horse
all the way from Ipswich?

10:16.080 --> 10:19.040
Yes. The only reason
I'm meeting Dennis here

10:19.120 --> 10:22.200
in this bugger house,
it's one of the few places in London

10:22.280 --> 10:24.360
where you can still
tie up your horse outside.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.960
Christ, Cambridge!

10:26.040 --> 10:28.080
Roadworks at Cambridge were there, Dennis?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.000
Roadworks, Cambridge!

10:30.080 --> 10:33.280
You said you were using that new device.
The Sat Nav for the elderly.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.840
Rubbish, useless!

10:34.920 --> 10:36.520
[Blair] Probably doesn't work on horses.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.840
Why the fuck is he talking
in that crazy way?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.400
Because since Dennis
retired from the regiment,

10:41.480 --> 10:44.200
he's landed himself
a cushy little job at the BBC.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.840
He's the announcer
on that university quiz program.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.520
Oh, that, yes.
I haven't seen that in 30 years,

10:50.600 --> 10:52.400
but there again I never watch television.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.600
Though I have heard
Breaking Bad  is very good.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.040
What happens is the student presses
a buzzer when he

11:01.120 --> 11:02.920
or she... [laughs]

11:03.000 --> 11:07.480
thinks they know the answer,
and Dennis gives the name and university.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.720
-That's the easiest job in the world.
-Dennis is getting a bit tired

11:10.800 --> 11:14.120
of the traveling though. Especially since
he goes everywhere by horse.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.520
-So, he's retiring.
-Well, I could do that job.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.080
How much do you earn in a year?

11:18.160 --> 11:19.400
Half a... million!

11:19.480 --> 11:22.360
Shit! Could you put a word in for me?

11:22.440 --> 11:24.400
Certainly, yes!

11:24.480 --> 11:27.560
You'd have to watch yourself though.
You'll probably have to meet Paxman.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.480
-Who?
-Jeremy Paxman!

11:29.560 --> 11:30.840
The miserable presenter.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.160
Year above me at Eton.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.000
He was a sullen little prick, even then.

11:35.080 --> 11:40.560
Who cares? Half a million quid? Just for
saying the names of a bunch of students?

11:40.640 --> 11:45.520
-Huh! Easy... peasy!
-Don't do that, Toast.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.600
[tannoy]  Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.120
Tonight's performance
will begin in five minutes.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.440
[Toast] I say!

11:59.520 --> 12:04.400
It's a little queer that there aren't any
directors or stage managers around.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.480
Oh, we've been at it so long

12:06.560 --> 12:10.560
that everything more or less
happens automatically. [laughs]

12:10.640 --> 12:14.680
No real dramas to speak of.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.720
Apart from Ken.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.080
Ken? What about Ken?

12:18.160 --> 12:24.760
He just occasionally forgets his lines
when a new actor joins the production.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.120
Or... Or there isn't a full house.

12:28.200 --> 12:33.480
[growls] One... minute...
until curtain up.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.560
All right, let's do this.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
[Penny] What?

12:38.920 --> 12:41.040
There's no one there!

12:41.120 --> 12:45.040
I need a full house! I can't go on!

12:45.120 --> 12:47.480
-[Penny sobs]
-Get a fucking grip, woman!

12:47.560 --> 12:49.920
-[audience gasps]
-[woman whispers] What did he say?

12:52.680 --> 12:57.000
I am Inspector Attenborough,
from Scotland Yard.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.400
One of your servants rang me
about a murder.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.640
So, I wish to interview you all. No?

13:04.720 --> 13:07.520
You don't come on till Act Three!

13:07.600 --> 13:09.040
Right.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.480
I'll be back.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.480
Yes, I know. It's Act Three.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.440
I'm on in a... moment.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.480
[ghostly voice] There's not many
in tonight.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.480
[door creaks and slams]

13:30.280 --> 13:34.560
So, what time did you hear this scream,
Colonel Granville?

13:34.640 --> 13:38.920
I... um, uh... uh... uh...

13:39.000 --> 13:42.880
Miss Crabtree informed us
that she retired at 11:30.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.880
Was it after that?

13:44.960 --> 13:46.680
[stammers]

13:46.760 --> 13:48.920
-Well, say your line, man!
-I've forgotten it.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.600
[man 1] The chauffeur did it.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.000
-[Toast] Bloody hell.
-[man 2] I say, the chauffeur did it.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.120
Yes!

13:58.360 --> 14:01.280
I say, the chauffeur did it!
The chauffeur did it!

14:01.360 --> 14:04.440
-The  chauffeur did it!
-The chauffeur is the murderer, yes.

14:04.520 --> 14:11.520
-The  chauffeur is the murderer, yes.
-There's not many in tonight.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.320
Finishing touches!

15:26.920 --> 15:29.600
[Toast] Ha-ha! Starter for ten.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.080
I think Oxford is the better team, Toast.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.440
Maybe you should swap
Sooty and Richard Osman.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.560
It doesn't matter, Ed.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.680
I wanted Salman Rushdie and Germaine
Greer, instead of Sooty and Sweep,

15:38.760 --> 15:41.600
-but I couldn't find their pictures.
-Why do we have to have any women?

15:42.120 --> 15:44.280
I've never noticed a woman
on that program.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.400
Who cares, Blair?
It's important that I get this job.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.040
That play's a disaster.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.600
Ed, you be Oxford.

15:50.680 --> 15:51.880
Blair, you're Cambridge.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.240
Get on your buzzers
and I'll practice saying the names.

15:56.560 --> 16:02.160
Chemistry. What ionic logarithm
is the carbon derivative of ten?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.240
Oh...

16:04.520 --> 16:05.960
-Come on, buzz.
-I'm trying to think.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.400
Who'd be good at chemistry?

16:07.480 --> 16:09.600
You've selected classicists
and journalists.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.200
Well, can we at least get rid
of Janet Street-Porter?

16:12.280 --> 16:13.320
Just press anything.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.000
-[buzzer sounds]
-Oxford, Fry!

16:16.400 --> 16:18.160
-Well, I don't know the answer.
-Me neither.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.440
Look, have you got any questions
on military history?

16:20.520 --> 16:23.840
Look, scrap that.
Randomly press and I'll say the names.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.920
-[buzzer sounds]
-[Toast] Cambridge, Yentob!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.400
-[buzzer sounds]
-Oxford, Kureishi!

16:30.480 --> 16:32.360
-[buzzer sounds]
-Cambridge, Sweep!

16:32.440 --> 16:33.560
This is quite fun, actually.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.520
Isn't it? And I'm excellent at it.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.520
Yes, it's noticeable that the women
haven't answered anything.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.040
-When's your audition tomorrow?
-Three o'clock.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.240
-Will Paxman be there?
-Apparently so.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.080
-It's funny you've never heard about him.
-I never watch television.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.360
Although I hear
Breaking Bad  is very good.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.720
-[buzzers sound]
-[Ed] Sorry, Toast.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.800
I think it's electrocuting me.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.080
[Ed] Not quite sure where we are, Toast.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.080
Since they closed down Television Centre,

17:03.160 --> 17:06.160
nobody really knows
where the BBC actually is now.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.359
I haven't got a clue either, Ed.
Do you have a Sat Nav?

17:10.440 --> 17:14.400
Good thought, Toast.
As it happens, I bought one just recently.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.680
-Ah.
-Let's see.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.520
-[Sat Nav beeps]
-[Toast]  You are now turning into...

17:18.599 --> 17:22.200
-[Sat Nav beeps]
-...St. Wafford... Abergavenny...

17:22.280 --> 17:24.560
What the hell's the time? Fuck this...

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
-Um, was that...?
-Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.320
-Ah.
-[Sat Nav beeps]

17:29.400 --> 17:32.480
[Toast]  Who the hell are you?
Albrighton...

17:32.560 --> 17:34.560
-Ah, fuck this!
-[laughs]

17:37.600 --> 17:39.160
[Toast] There it is! Stop!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
[brakes screech]

17:44.080 --> 17:45.080
What the...

17:45.600 --> 17:47.480
[man] Like the sound of that?
Thought not.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.560
Who the hell are you again?

17:49.640 --> 17:52.920
Who the hell? I'm Steven Toast.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.120
I'm here for the
university quiz show voiceover gig.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.600
Steven Toast. And what are
your qualifications for this job exactly?

18:00.680 --> 18:04.240
I'm an experienced actor
and voiceover artist.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.160
I'm a little surprised
you haven't heard of me.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.520
Steven Toast... Hang on a second. Oh, God.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.280
You're that idiot that gave away
the ending of  The Moosetrap.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.520
Well, I went on  Woman's Hour  on Radio 4
and was asked a question--

18:17.600 --> 18:19.800
Did you give away
the ending of  The Moosetrap?

18:19.880 --> 18:21.920
I was asked a question on said show...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.760
Did you give away
the ending of  The Moosetrap?

18:24.840 --> 18:27.440
Many topics were discussed,
one of which was  The Moo--

18:27.520 --> 18:29.760
Did you give away
the ending of  The Moosetrap?

18:29.840 --> 18:32.600
It was a promotional interview.
She asked me the question...

18:32.680 --> 18:35.760
[loudly] Did you give away
the ending of  The Moosetrap?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.920
[shouts] Why the fuck
do you keep asking me that?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.800
You're a rude fella,
if you don't mind me saying.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.400
[scoffs] Well, and you're an idiot.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.960
What did you just say?

18:45.720 --> 18:49.040
-You'll apologize for that, big boy.
-No, I won't.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.920
What's that meant to be?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.800
That's my sculpture of
the Angel of the North,

18:54.880 --> 18:56.280
which I made out of matchsticks.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.440
Well, if you don't apologize, I'll smash
your sculpture of the Angel of the North,

19:00.520 --> 19:02.800
-which you made out of matchsticks.
-Hm.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.720
You wouldn't dare.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.760
That was a very stupid thing to do.
[yells]

19:20.720 --> 19:22.160
[smash]

19:24.120 --> 19:25.120
Paxman?

19:26.320 --> 19:28.960
Paxman? Where the hell did he go?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.520
[Blair] Ahh.

19:32.600 --> 19:37.760
And so it becomes very clear.
An unlikely killer, to be sure.

19:37.840 --> 19:44.440
But there was only one person
who had the motive, means and opportunity

19:44.520 --> 19:47.880
to commit such a foul deed.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.640
The murderer is...

19:51.680 --> 19:53.840
-Lady Beddington.
-Huh?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.800
-[whispers] That's a surprise.
-What?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.960
No, no, you idiot!
The chauffeur did it!

19:59.040 --> 20:00.560
No. It was Lady Beddington.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.680
[gasps]

20:02.520 --> 20:05.280
No, no, this is all wrong.
The chauffeur did it!

20:05.360 --> 20:07.840
-[Penny gasps]
-My God! I think she's dead.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.440
-Oh, brilliant.
-What's going on, Toast?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.280
I was just trying
to shake things up a bit.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.160
How dare you, Post?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.600
Toast, you fucknut!

20:15.680 --> 20:17.280
You bloody ruined it!

20:17.360 --> 20:18.800
-[man] Rubbish!
-Out of my way!

20:19.720 --> 20:22.600
Oh, that's right, yeah. Go on.
Desert a sinking ship.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.600
Bugger off to  Cats,
or whatever it is you losers enjoy?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.160
-[growls]
-Screw you, old timers!

20:28.240 --> 20:29.440
Good for you, Toast.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.480
[chokes]

20:31.560 --> 20:32.800
[yells]

20:32.880 --> 20:38.000
-[Albert] There's not many in tonight.
-[Toast] I know! So you keep saying!

20:42.240 --> 20:43.880
Sixty years, Toast.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.600
Sixty long and successful years

20:47.680 --> 20:52.240
and now the show has closed
and a wonderful actress has died.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.880
I didn't know she was one of your clients.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.040
Yes. The only thing she did,
apart from that play,

20:57.120 --> 20:59.520
was an episode of  Poldark  in 1973.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.920
Such a tragedy. And all down to you.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.400
You won't be able to show your face
around here for a while.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.400
I think you should go and live in France.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.760
And one more thing.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.960
What's this I hear about you on
that university quiz show on the BBC?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
-Uh...
-Ah! Just about to tell me, were you?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.600
Going behind my back,
trying to get jobs on your own, were you?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.720
You fucking weasel!

21:22.840 --> 21:25.080
-I just fancied the--
-“Fancied myself as an agent,"

21:25.160 --> 21:27.280
by the sounds of things. What have I said?

21:27.360 --> 21:30.000
-That you are never--
-Never to try and get jobs on my own.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.960
You are never ever to try
and get jobs on your own.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.880
Well, you haven't got this job, anyway.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.560
-Who got it?
-Well, not you.

21:35.640 --> 21:40.040
Because, apparently, you had some kind of
argument with Jeremy Paxman,

21:40.120 --> 21:43.000
destroyed his matchstick model
of the Angel of the North

21:43.080 --> 21:44.680
and threw him out of a window.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.400
Did you throw Jeremy Paxman
out of a window?

21:47.480 --> 21:48.560
No!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.880
-Well, kind of.
-[sighs] Oh.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.080
I didn't throw him out of a window, though
he did end up going through a window.

21:54.160 --> 21:58.880
Unbelievable behavior, Toast.
You have created a perfect fiasco.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.200
And now you're kind of
throwing Jeremy Paxman out of windows

22:02.280 --> 22:06.840
and destroying his matchstick models.
Really, Toast! I mean, really!

22:13.880 --> 22:15.600
I think you know what to do.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.040
And do a good job this time.
Your last attempt wasn't very thorough.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.000
Here's your starter for ten.
What was the name of the second-rate actor

22:48.080 --> 22:51.600
who single handedly forced the closure of
the legendary play,  The Moosetrap,

22:51.680 --> 22:54.280
after a successful 60-year run
in London's West End?

22:54.360 --> 22:57.040
-[buzzer sounds]
-Cambridge, Clacy-Smith!

22:57.640 --> 22:59.960
-Steven Post?
-Near enough.
