the greater good.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.333
Trying to understand
this incredibly powerful,

04:54.458 --> 04:56.208
incredibly complex mystery.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.042
Thanks for everybody being here.

-MARTY: There you go.
-Yeah.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.167
MARTY: The first thing
I want to talk about,

05:08.292 --> 05:10.083
'cause it's what keeps
me coming back

05:10.208 --> 05:13.792
with enthusiasm, is that
there is gold in the water.

05:13.917 --> 05:17.500
The number one goal
is to trace that gold

05:17.583 --> 05:19.417
in the water back to its source,

05:19.542 --> 05:21.875
and then dig it up.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.917
So, last year,
we had anomalous gold

05:27.042 --> 05:28.125
in the water,

05:28.250 --> 05:29.667
but our data set wasn't large.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.500
It was based on 20 holes
in the Money Pit.

05:32.625 --> 05:36.167
So, this year,
we identified 50 holes

05:36.292 --> 05:39.042
-to collect a bigger data set.
-Mm-hmm.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.500
To that end, uh, Dr. Spooner,

05:41.667 --> 05:43.208
as we drill
all these other wells

05:43.375 --> 05:45.000
to chase the gold in the water,

05:45.125 --> 05:47.208
how are we going to do it
and what have we done so far?

05:47.375 --> 05:49.833
<i>Yeah, uh, yeah, thanks, Marty.</i>

05:49.958 --> 05:51.375
I mean, what we're trying to do,
really, is

05:51.542 --> 05:53.042
figure out where water travels

05:53.167 --> 05:54.542
in The Money Pit,
how water moves.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.667
<i>We've been putting in
these wells</i>

05:56.833 --> 05:58.583
<i>that'll help us track water.</i>

05:58.708 --> 06:01.667
<i>So, then, when we do find gold
in the water,</i>

06:01.792 --> 06:03.500
we can get a bit better idea

06:03.625 --> 06:06.125
-where it's coming from.
-Yeah.

06:06.708 --> 06:07.667
IAN:
All right,

06:09.542 --> 06:11.875
<i>geoscientist
Dr. Ian Spooner,</i>

06:12.000 --> 06:14.542
<i>collected water samples
from numerous boreholes</i>

<i>that the team has drilled</i>

06:16.417 --> 06:19.333
<i>over the past decade

high trace evidence of</i>

<i>both silver and gold
in numerous locations.</i>

06:26.583 --> 06:30.167

<i>a new core-drilling operation
involving more than</i>

06:33.375 --> 06:35.667
<i>50 planned boreholes
to not only look</i>

06:35.833 --> 06:37.583
<i>for hard evidence of treasure</i>

06:37.708 --> 06:40.375
<i>but also allow
Dr. Spooner to conduct</i>

06:40.500 --> 06:43.417
<i>much more sophisticated
water tests.</i>

06:44.542 --> 06:47.042
<i>By using a device
known as a level logger,</i>

06:47.167 --> 06:50.000
<i>Dr. Spooner believes he can
determine the direction</i>

06:50.167 --> 06:53.500
<i>of water flow deep underground
in the Money Pit area.</i>

06:53.667 --> 06:56.417
<i>This would allow him to
also track where the evidence</i>

06:56.542 --> 06:58.833
<i>of gold is coming from.</i>

06:59.000 --> 07:02.667
<i>IAN:
What's important to me is,
if we can isolate that gold</i>

07:02.750 --> 07:05.208
in the water
down to a specific location.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.167
By specific,
I mean 20 feet by 20 feet.

07:08.250 --> 07:13.333
<i>Then we know almost certainly
that the gold's been in place.</i>

07:13.500 --> 07:17.583
Fantastic. Find us
that 20 by 20 box, okay?

07:17.708 --> 07:19.917

07:23.500 --> 07:26.708
Okay. Rick,
what's the next topic?

07:26.875 --> 07:29.667
I think the elephant in the room
is the muon technology.

07:29.792 --> 07:32.333
Right. You know,
everything's in place.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.333
-Everything's recording.
-Mm-hmm.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.750

I have to say every time we've
dug in there, we've found stuff.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.792
-Right, Gary? Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.333
I think there's still some story
there to be understood.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.333
-Yes.
-MARTY: Okay.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.083
And I see over here
on the right,

09:58.208 --> 10:00.708
-with Helen, I see a new face.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.167
So we have a new member of
our archeological team,

10:03.250 --> 10:05.042
Emma Culligan.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.250
She's gonna be running
CT scanner

10:07.375 --> 10:08.500
and the other equipment

10:08.625 --> 10:09.917
that we're gonna have
on the island.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.792
-Oh.
-EMMA: Yeah,
so I studied engineering,

10:12.875 --> 10:15.625
um, as well as archeology,
kind of a niche

10:15.750 --> 10:17.750
that I wanted to create
for myself. So...

10:17.875 --> 10:20.167
Uh, yeah, I think you've
come into a pretty good niche.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.167
-(laughter)
-We're gonna keep her
pretty busy this summer.

10:23.292 --> 10:26.250
Excellent. Well,
welcome to the fellowship.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.750
Well, that nicely brings us
to one of Rick's

10:28.875 --> 10:30.167
favorites and that's research.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.833
Because I will say that

10:31.917 --> 10:34.292
what happened in Portugal is
a bit of an eye-opener.

10:34.375 --> 10:35.833
I was surprised

10:35.958 --> 10:37.917
how many potentially
relevant things you found.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.375
-Oh. Good morning.
-Welcome to Portugal.
-RICK: Thank you.

12:10.833 --> 12:13.083
I have high hopes for it.

12:13.208 --> 12:16.542

a lot of stuff there.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.333

some more.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.250

-Okay, so that's Lot 8.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.167

a pretty full schedule.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.708
I think so.

something this far out

It was found on Lot 8.

investigations there,

30:14.208 --> 30:16.958

31:31.458 --> 31:33.208

Like hauling wood out

31:33.333 --> 31:37.042

33:24.292 --> 33:26.875
We'd expect something
on the East Drumlin like this.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.667

a useful hook to have.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.417
But this was found, like,
in the middle of the lot.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.458

RICK:

33:53.250 --> 33:55.125
We would have to have
this conserved

33:55.250 --> 33:57.667

33:57.792 --> 34:01.708

with something.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.333
We will definitely
put a notation on here and...

34:10.833 --> 34:13.667
-Very interesting.
-That could date back quite old

41:59.000 --> 42:02.458
Almost a 100 feet,
with another 2 or 3 feet to go.

42:05.292 --> 42:08.333
Another foot
and we should be peeking out.

42:09.958 --> 42:13.083
31.15,
we're getting very close.

42:20.083 --> 42:23.125
-Right there. 31.94.
-TERRY: There it is. Okay.

42:23.250 --> 42:25.042
Paul, do you want to take us
down just a little bit further?

42:25.208 --> 42:27.750
Let's get the camera
outside of the casing, first.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.667
PAUL:
Just below.

42:29.792 --> 42:31.167
SCOTT:
Just right there, right there.

42:31.333 --> 42:32.667
RICK:
There you go.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.417
PAUL:
There you can see the teeth.

42:34.542 --> 42:37.125
-Can we, can we turn?
-Okay.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.167
-It looks like a shark jaw.
-SCOTT (chuckles): It is.

42:42.292 --> 42:43.708
TERRY:
We got <i>Jaws</i> going on here.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.458
-RICK: Woah!
-SCOTT: There's a timber there.

42:48.542 --> 42:50.000
STEVE:
Yep.

42:51.208 --> 42:52.833
TERRY:
Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

42:52.958 --> 42:54.625
We are in the tunnel.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.000
<i>RICK:
We saw broken timbers.</i>

42:57.083 --> 43:00.333
Certainly the bit was
coming down, vertically,

43:00.500 --> 43:03.667
<i>It had gone through a ceiling,</i>

43:03.792 --> 43:05.542
<i>and then there was a void.</i>

43:05.667 --> 43:07.542
<i>It's pretty amazing.</i>

43:07.667 --> 43:10.333
TERRY: Look at that, that's
a 45-degree cut, right there.

43:10.458 --> 43:12.625
You can even see the splinters
on the sides of that beam.

43:12.708 --> 43:14.667
-TERRY: For sure.
-SCOTT: That's a great image
right there.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.583
I think that-that, to me,
is almost

43:17.708 --> 43:19.708
the-the ceiling of the tunnel.

43:19.875 --> 43:21.542
Kind of looks like
a fastener or head of a bolt

43:21.667 --> 43:23.750
-or something right there.
-PAUL: It could be a dowel.

43:24.792 --> 43:26.458
<i>NARRATOR:
A possible wooden dowel?</i>

43:26.542 --> 43:31.500
<i>In a tunnel found more than 100
feet deep in the Money Pit area?</i>

43:32.667 --> 43:35.458
<i>Dating back to as early
as the seventh century AD,</i>

43:35.542 --> 43:38.042
<i>wooden dowels are fasteners
used to connect</i>

43:38.208 --> 43:41.042
<i>the timbers of large structures.</i>

43:42.458 --> 43:45.083
<i>Because metal fasteners
were generally used</i>

43:45.208 --> 43:47.375
<i>by treasure hunters
who built shafts and tunnels</i>

43:47.542 --> 43:51.625
<i>after the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795,</i>

43:51.708 --> 43:54.417
<i>could a wooden dowel
offer evidence</i>

43:54.542 --> 43:57.625
<i>that this tunnel
predates searcher activities?</i>

43:57.708 --> 44:03.000
<i>If so, who built it, when,
and where does it lead?</i>

44:03.083 --> 44:05.750
Two things,
it is two separate beams,

44:05.875 --> 44:08.083
or it's a collapse.

44:08.208 --> 44:11.083
And that sure looks like
it suffered some sort

44:11.208 --> 44:13.042
-of catastrophic break.
-Damage, yeah.

44:13.208 --> 44:16.625
So, that would be my guess
that it went like that.

44:16.708 --> 44:18.958
Well, guys, I don't know
if we're gonna see much more

44:19.083 --> 44:20.292
than we have so far.

44:20.417 --> 44:22.167
We got some great images
of those beams.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.792
-Very interesting.
-Straight up.

44:23.875 --> 44:25.958
But, you know,
we just don't have the light

44:26.042 --> 44:27.208
to see further down
into that opening, you know,

44:27.333 --> 44:29.000
to see where
that tunnel may go

44:29.083 --> 44:30.583
or what else may be in there.

44:32.042 --> 44:33.708
PAUL:
We should definitely
send the video to Prohawk,

44:33.833 --> 44:35.875
so they can clean the video up,

44:36.042 --> 44:37.833
maybe get
through the sand and silt,

44:37.958 --> 44:39.417
and we'll get a better look
at the structure.

44:39.542 --> 44:41.833
But also just an indication,
an outline,

44:41.958 --> 44:44.917
-of what it looks like,
potentially.
-RICK: Yeah.

44:45.042 --> 44:46.708
That's our next step,
so let's initiate that process.

44:46.833 --> 44:49.167
-All right.
-Super.
-Sounds good.

44:49.292 --> 44:51.833
RICK:
Marty needs to see this footage.

44:57.333 --> 44:59.125
<i>NARRATOR:
The following morning...</i>

44:59.208 --> 45:01.667
<i>Hey, good morning,
Fellowshippers!</i>

45:01.792 --> 45:03.792
-Hey, Marty.
-Hey Marty.

45:03.917 --> 45:05.250
<i>...Rick Lagina and members
of the team</i>

45:05.375 --> 45:08.917
<i>meet via conference
with Marty Lagina,</i>

45:09.042 --> 45:10.917
<i>who has been called away
from the island</i>

45:11.042 --> 45:13.042
<i>on important business.</i>

45:13.167 --> 45:15.208
<i>They are eager to share
the stunning footage</i>

45:15.333 --> 45:18.208
<i>of their latest discovery
in the Money Pit.</i>

45:18.375 --> 45:21.292
So, this is one of
the most exciting days

45:21.375 --> 45:24.167
we've had in the last...
I don't even want to count

45:24.333 --> 45:26.500
how many years
we've been here now.

45:26.625 --> 45:29.000
But, uh, for the first time,
we will look at

45:29.167 --> 45:31.333
really hi-res photos

45:31.458 --> 45:34.667
in a man-made structure
in the Money Pit.

45:37.250 --> 45:39.125
-We'll share a screen.
-Yep, I'll share my screen.

45:39.208 --> 45:41.208
That'd be great. It's exciting.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.750
STEVE:
All right, Marty.
Here's the video.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.750
<i>-Okay.</i>
-STEVE: Can you see it?

45:45.875 --> 45:47.125
<i>Yeah, I can see it. Yep.</i>

45:47.250 --> 45:48.792
STEVE:
So, this is just a quick view

45:48.875 --> 45:50.958
-of what we could see.
-Okay.

45:51.042 --> 45:53.958
All right,
Marty, so we took that image

45:54.083 --> 45:55.833
and this is the enhancement
from Prohawk.

45:55.917 --> 45:57.833
MARTY:
Wow.

45:57.958 --> 46:01.542
<i>NARRATOR: In order to enhance
the compelling video footage,</i>

46:01.667 --> 46:04.542
<i>the team has commissioned
a company known as</i>

46:04.667 --> 46:06.417
<i>Prohawk Technology Group.</i>

46:06.542 --> 46:10.000
<i>Their revolutionary software
makes murky images</i>

46:10.167 --> 46:12.458
<i>appear clearer
and in higher resolution.</i>

46:14.417 --> 46:15.917
Yeah, that's a broken timber.

46:16.042 --> 46:17.833
We think the beam has
probably collapsed

46:18.000 --> 46:19.708
as the-the casing
came down into it.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.625
The original tunnel height is
about four to five feet high.

46:25.708 --> 46:29.542
So, at this point, we found
a new undiscovered tunnel?

46:29.667 --> 46:30.625
That's the hope.

46:31.875 --> 46:33.708
<i>MARTY:
That's really cool.</i>

46:33.875 --> 46:36.125
It's kind of an odd location.

46:36.250 --> 46:38.250
DOUG:
So what is that tunnel?

46:38.375 --> 46:40.625
Is that tunnel
a searcher tunnel?

46:40.708 --> 46:42.167
Or is it original works?

46:42.250 --> 46:45.208
It may lead to
the "True Money Pit."

46:45.375 --> 46:48.333
I mean, we all feel we've lost
the location of the Money Pit.

46:48.417 --> 46:51.750
So, it'd be
good information to...

46:51.875 --> 46:53.875
You know, if we can confirm
what it is,

46:54.042 --> 46:56.250
it'd help decide
where we need to go.

47:00.042 --> 47:03.625
<i>NARRATOR:
Could it be possible that, after
more than a decade of searching,</i>

47:03.750 --> 47:06.958
<i>the Oak Island team has
finally discovered</i>

47:07.042 --> 47:09.500
<i>a tunnel more than
100 feet underground</i>

47:09.625 --> 47:12.667
<i>that may be connected
to the original Money Pit?</i>

47:12.792 --> 47:16.708
<i>And if so, might it lead
to the source of silver and gold</i>

47:16.833 --> 47:19.583
<i>that has been detected
through scientific testing?</i>

47:19.708 --> 47:23.042
I'm not an expert
in all of this stuff, okay?

47:23.208 --> 47:25.458
<i>But it could be
the fabled flood tunnel.</i>

47:25.542 --> 47:27.917
<i>We don't know what it is,
but it's previously unknown.</i>

47:28.042 --> 47:29.958
<i>So that's good.</i>

47:30.083 --> 47:33.583
<i>That's clearly,
by definition, a find.</i>

47:33.708 --> 47:36.042
<i>It could yield answers.</i>

47:36.167 --> 47:37.958
We should have
a proper discussion

47:38.042 --> 47:40.875
-about what we do next.
-Yeah.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.167
Considering we're fortunate
enough to have this open tunnel,

47:44.292 --> 47:46.000
um, I think it's a good idea

47:46.125 --> 47:48.000
that maybe we put a sonar
down there.

47:48.083 --> 47:50.375
See how far it's open,
direction it's heading,

47:50.500 --> 47:52.417
get a good image, you know,
underground,

47:52.542 --> 47:55.417
-and we can learn a lot
from that.
-Okay.

47:56.417 --> 47:57.875
JACK:
And test the wood.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.667
Maybe this tunnel is
from the 1700s or older.

48:00.792 --> 48:02.625
-Ultimately, you're right.
-It could be from depositor.

48:02.708 --> 48:06.292
CRAIG:
Right. The first well
drilled into the tunnel,

48:06.375 --> 48:10.083
K-15.5, it's been sent out
for carbon dating.

48:10.208 --> 48:11.625
Okay, good.

48:11.750 --> 48:13.292
<i>Here's my take on it.</i>

48:13.417 --> 48:15.208
<i>-It's really cool
and it's neat to see it.</i>
-Yeah.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.625
And the most exciting is
Jack's hypotheses,

48:17.708 --> 48:20.750
<i>which is that
this is a previously unknown,</i>

48:20.875 --> 48:22.458
perhaps, depositor tunnel.

48:22.583 --> 48:25.708
That is really exciting if
that's what it turns out to be.

48:28.542 --> 48:31.250
<i>RICK:
The most astounding thing
of all would be,</i>

48:31.375 --> 48:34.542
<i>if we can make a determination
that this is original,</i>

48:34.667 --> 48:36.083
<i>it's huge.</i>

48:36.208 --> 48:39.750
We would expend
the sufficient monies,

48:39.875 --> 48:42.833
sufficient time,
sufficient energy

48:42.917 --> 48:45.417
to follow the tunnel, literally,

48:45.542 --> 48:47.625
to, hopefully, X marks the spot.

48:48.667 --> 48:50.792
<i>If this is original,
it's the one thing,</i>

48:50.875 --> 48:52.500
<i>there's no question about it.</i>

48:52.625 --> 48:55.667
<i>You know, maybe in front of us
we have the proof.</i>

48:55.750 --> 48:57.708
<i>MARTY:
You know, here we drilled
all these wells,</i>

48:57.875 --> 49:00.750
all hundreds of them,
and we never hit this before.

49:02.167 --> 49:04.250
And so, you know,
it kind of goes to your point

49:04.375 --> 49:07.083
that there could be
stuff still within that matrix

49:07.208 --> 49:09.708
that we haven't hit,
because we just did.

49:09.875 --> 49:11.667
<i>So, uh, that's-that's good.</i>

49:11.750 --> 49:14.167
Keep going. Good info, guys.
Appreciate it.

49:14.333 --> 49:16.458
All right, we'll let you know
how it turns out.

49:16.542 --> 49:18.000
<i>-CRAIG: See you later.
-MARTY: Appreciate it.</i>

49:18.083 --> 49:19.333
<i>-Thank you.
-RICK: See ya.</i>

49:23.417 --> 49:25.250
<i>NARRATOR:
As another new day
begins on Oak Island...</i>

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
<i>PAUL:
Okay, here's the sonar unit.</i>

49:28.625 --> 49:31.500
<i>...Rick Lagina, along
with members of the team,</i>

49:31.625 --> 49:33.417
<i>have returned to
the Money Pit area</i>

49:33.542 --> 49:36.333
<i>in order to conduct
a sonar operation</i>

49:36.458 --> 49:39.333
<i>in Borehole M-16.25.</i>

49:39.500 --> 49:42.208
We're gonna have to
measure it out to 103.8.

49:42.333 --> 49:45.083
<i>NARRATOR:
A borehole where, two days ago,</i>

49:45.208 --> 49:47.958
<i>the team recorded video
of an approximately</i>

49:48.042 --> 49:49.250
<i>five-foot tall, man-made tunnel,</i>

49:49.375 --> 49:53.250
<i>some 103 feet deep underground.</i>

49:55.208 --> 49:56.500
I'm gonna pull it
right to the end, Paul.

49:56.625 --> 49:57.792
Right to the end.
Make it tight.

49:57.917 --> 49:59.542
And then we'll mark our spots.

49:59.667 --> 50:03.792
My hope is that we'll see enough
to give Steve a line.

50:03.917 --> 50:07.000
-Yeah.
-And then you can project
the line, right?

50:07.083 --> 50:09.583
Okay, Steve,
I think we've got it marked.

50:09.708 --> 50:11.667
-Okay.
-All right.

50:11.750 --> 50:14.542
<i>NARRATOR:
Now, as they await
carbon dating analysis</i>

50:14.667 --> 50:16.458
<i>on a wood sample

50:16.542 --> 50:18.708
<i>from their initial discovery
of the structure...</i>

50:18.833 --> 50:21.500
Hey, guys. You guys all done?
We're all ready.

50:21.625 --> 50:24.500
<i>...it is Rick, Marty
and the team's hope</i>

50:24.667 --> 50:26.917
<i>that by utilizing
a sonar device,</i>

50:27.042 --> 50:30.417
<i>they can determine which
direction the tunnel may lead.</i>

50:30.542 --> 50:32.917
So, Paul, we'll see this
in real time, right?

50:33.042 --> 50:35.667
Yes, as we're sending it down
it will scan 360 degrees,

50:35.833 --> 50:37.292
and it'll give us
a profile of what it sees

50:37.375 --> 50:38.708
outward from the sonar,

50:38.833 --> 50:40.417
and it reflects back
for a sound signal.

50:40.542 --> 50:42.000
And the data will record?

50:42.125 --> 50:43.833
Data will record to the unit,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.917
and we'll be able
to play it back

50:46.042 --> 50:47.167
-in real time as well.
-Perfect.

50:47.292 --> 50:48.500
Okay. Ready, guys?

50:48.583 --> 50:49.833
PAUL:
All right. Yep, yep.

50:49.917 --> 50:51.458
Recording the log.

50:52.542 --> 50:54.042
<i>RICK:
Let's say this is original.</i>

50:54.167 --> 50:56.417
<i>Then we follow it, no question.</i>

50:56.542 --> 51:00.792
If it's searcher era,
we're gonna want to know

51:00.875 --> 51:03.417
the orientation,
because searchers were going

51:03.542 --> 51:05.333
to X marks the spot,

51:05.417 --> 51:07.000
where they thought
the treasure might be.

51:07.167 --> 51:09.833
-Got 103-foot-eight,
I believe, Steve?
-STEVE: Yep.

51:09.917 --> 51:12.750
We should be well
within the water right now.

51:13.958 --> 51:15.833
<i>If the sonar operates properly,</i>

51:16.000 --> 51:18.208
<i>and if we get that orientation,</i>

51:18.333 --> 51:20.167
<i>we can project those lines.</i>

51:20.292 --> 51:23.000
All right.
Well, that's interesting.

51:23.167 --> 51:24.875
<i>RICK:
The excitement is palpable.</i>

51:25.000 --> 51:26.625
<i>There's no question about it.</i>

51:26.708 --> 51:29.417
We're already
starting to see a profile...

51:29.542 --> 51:31.500
Something rectangular.

51:32.708 --> 51:36.250
We have green to red,
so red being the highest.

51:36.375 --> 51:38.375
We're getting
solid dense material,

51:38.500 --> 51:41.042
so those could be beams.

51:41.167 --> 51:42.500
I would say
it makes sense logically,

51:42.625 --> 51:44.792
because
there's a pattern to them.

51:44.875 --> 51:47.750
They're integrally spaced
from each other,

51:47.875 --> 51:50.458
and they seem to be reoccurring
at regular intervals.

51:51.708 --> 51:53.583
-That looks fantastic.
-SCOTT: Also the shape of that

51:53.708 --> 51:54.792
kind of gives like a little bit
of an elbow in that,

51:54.875 --> 51:55.792
if it's a tunnel.

51:57.708 --> 51:59.833
TERRY:
And we seem to be right
in the middle of that bend,

52:00.000 --> 52:01.667
that slight crook.

52:01.792 --> 52:04.000
We're just right about here.
It's kind of interesting.

52:05.417 --> 52:07.500
Am I seeing that we're going
past the five-meter mark

52:07.583 --> 52:09.417
-in that other direction?
-TERRY: Yes.

52:10.708 --> 52:14.042
20 feet out and it's about 15
in the other direction.

52:16.708 --> 52:20.500
We've got about 35 feet
of tunnel there in front of us.

52:20.625 --> 52:22.958
That's incredible.
That's quite the image.

52:24.750 --> 52:27.208
I'm troubled a bit by why
it's not seeing anything here,

52:27.375 --> 52:28.708
there's no explanation
like that.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.500
I wonder if that's
a collapsed feature there.

52:31.667 --> 52:33.292
And that's why
it's not seeing anything.

52:34.583 --> 52:36.500
PAUL:
To Rick's point, it does look
like it's collapsed.

52:36.583 --> 52:37.833
The other side is very square.

52:37.958 --> 52:39.708
This one comes
to a conical point.

52:39.833 --> 52:42.708
It kind of makes you think
that it could be collapsed.

52:42.875 --> 52:44.333
TERRY:
I think
it's really quite something.

52:44.458 --> 52:46.500
We've got 35 feet of tunnel
in front of us.

52:46.625 --> 52:48.000
At least we have
something in front of us

52:48.083 --> 52:49.625
that gives us a direction.

52:50.875 --> 52:52.667
<i>RICK:
There's no question
that the sonar</i>

52:52.750 --> 52:56.333
<i>is seeing an opening
and it can only be a tunnel.</i>

52:56.458 --> 52:58.833
But we have to derive more data
from this location,

52:58.958 --> 53:00.833
and we have to connect it
with the other data.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.292
<i>We need to go
and further investigate it.</i>

53:04.375 --> 53:06.958
My cautionary tale would be,

53:07.042 --> 53:10.292
let's wait until it gets
on the surveyor plan

53:10.375 --> 53:13.167
-before we say it's going here,
it's going there.
-SCOTT: Exactly.

53:13.292 --> 53:16.708
RICK:
Steve has the skill set
and the techniques

53:16.833 --> 53:20.333
available to him
to properly plot this on a map.

53:20.417 --> 53:22.500
-Absolutely.
-RICK: It's a tunnel.

persevering to follow this up,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.958

anything about

until I see it on a map.

another scan or two,

1:01:35.542 --> 1:01:41.042
35.5% from 1640 to 1687.

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:43.958
-Wow.
-So, you know, 70 to 80%

1:01:44.042 --> 1:01:49.417
is from 1640 to 1810.

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:54.833
The carbon dates
are pre-discovery

1:01:54.917 --> 1:01:57.125
and post-discovery
of the Money Pit.

1:01:57.250 --> 1:02:01.000
<i>That's what makes
this endeavor so difficult.</i>

1:02:01.083 --> 1:02:02.917
This time frame is
quite confusing,

1:02:03.042 --> 1:02:04.458
and we don't know
what to make of it.

1:02:04.542 --> 1:02:06.958
This thing just keeps
getting more complex

1:02:07.042 --> 1:02:09.167
by the... by the moment.

1:02:09.250 --> 1:02:13.125
JACK:
I see this
as kind of damning fact

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:15.042
that we found an
old tunnel finally,

1:02:15.167 --> 1:02:16.708
and we found something
that can be

1:02:16.875 --> 1:02:19.792
definitively substantial
and lead us on to something

1:02:19.875 --> 1:02:21.708
that could be
a treasure chamber.

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:23.750
And, if anything,
I'd say this might be

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:25.750
the oldest tunnel
we've ever found.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.750
I understand Jack's excitement.

1:02:27.875 --> 1:02:29.667
-Yeah.
-The dates seem to suggest

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:31.167
it's something earlier, so...

1:02:31.292 --> 1:02:32.750
that's something to be
excited about.

1:02:32.875 --> 1:02:37.000
I love those early 1700s dates.

1:02:37.167 --> 1:02:39.625
Could be some really,
really early gold

1:02:39.708 --> 1:02:43.792
and silver coins in that tunnel
or in the Garden Shaft.

1:02:43.875 --> 1:02:46.500
-CRAIG: We need more data.
-Yeah.

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:49.208
If we do drill into the tunnel
and we get more pieces of wood,

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:52.708
we'll just get more statistical
analysis of what makes sense.

1:02:52.875 --> 1:02:55.000
<i>MARTY:
Well, this is all intriguing</i>

1:02:55.125 --> 1:02:56.958
and of course, as usual,
it's a result

1:02:57.042 --> 1:03:00.042
that leads to more investigation
required, so...

1:03:00.167 --> 1:03:02.583
<i>let's pursue this,
let's continue to pursue it.</i>

1:03:02.708 --> 1:03:04.583
-Yep.
-Well done, guys.

1:03:04.708 --> 1:03:06.333
Okay.

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:08.375
We're not gonna do any work
sitting around this table,

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.917
so let's get back to work,
everybody.

1:03:11.042 --> 1:03:12.833
<i>MARTY:
Perfect. Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.250

1:03:50.042 --> 1:03:52.083
Can you show us the edge, Emma,

1:03:52.208 --> 1:03:53.792
-please?
-Yeah.

1:03:55.208 --> 1:03:57.042
LAIRD:
Right now, this is the CT scan.

1:03:57.167 --> 1:03:59.417
It's a...
interesting-looking piece.

1:04:00.667 --> 1:04:03.583
The edges are strange.

1:04:05.708 --> 1:04:07.875
GARY:
It looks like
whatever the metal is

1:04:08.042 --> 1:04:09.167
was cut with shears.

1:04:09.250 --> 1:04:11.125
Just cut like this.

1:04:11.250 --> 1:04:14.625
GARY:
Looks like it could be
something really special.

1:04:14.750 --> 1:04:17.792
I was hoping
that it was some kind of coin.

1:04:17.917 --> 1:04:19.375
LAIRD:
I think

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.583
you might find
what Emma has to say

1:04:21.708 --> 1:04:23.042
a little more interesting.

1:04:23.167 --> 1:04:24.792
Okay. That sounds great.

1:04:24.917 --> 1:04:26.000
Emma, do you want to...

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:27.500
-come up and, uh...
-Sure thing.

1:04:27.625 --> 1:04:29.333
LAIRD:
...tell 'em what you found?

1:04:30.167 --> 1:04:32.833
<i>NARRATOR:
Additionally,
the artifact has been scanned</i>

1:04:32.958 --> 1:04:37.125
<i>with an X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer, or XRF device,</i>

1:04:37.208 --> 1:04:40.167
<i>which can identify
the types of elements and metals</i>

1:04:40.292 --> 1:04:43.208
<i>that make up
an object's composition.</i>

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:45.833
So, what was really interesting
about this

1:04:45.958 --> 1:04:47.500
is the actual
material properties.

1:04:48.083 --> 1:04:50.583
This was the XRF analysis.

1:04:50.708 --> 1:04:52.833
So, it's mainly copper,

1:04:52.958 --> 1:04:54.333
which wasn't too surprising.

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:56.875
Then it had
an extremely high tin content,

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.333
which makes it bronze,

1:04:58.458 --> 1:05:01.917
along with a really high
arsenic content,

1:05:02.042 --> 1:05:04.375
which makes it
an arsenical bronze.

1:05:04.542 --> 1:05:06.333
And that stands out to me.

1:05:06.417 --> 1:05:08.000
JACK:
What would be

1:05:08.083 --> 1:05:10.500
the point
of a metal mixture like this?

1:05:10.583 --> 1:05:13.125
It increases
your tensile strength,

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:14.917
and it also reduces,

1:05:15.042 --> 1:05:16.708
-like, flaking.
-Yeah.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:18.792
So, anything with, like,
a high arsenic content

1:05:18.875 --> 1:05:20.667
has a low vaporizing point

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:23.667
that's lower than its melting
point of other metals.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:26.458
So during, like,
forging or casting,

1:05:26.542 --> 1:05:29.958
there'd be a lot of
arsen-arsenic gas in the air,

1:05:30.042 --> 1:05:31.792
which would affect
your nervous system.

1:05:31.875 --> 1:05:35.333
So there was this long period
of just it phasing out.

1:05:35.458 --> 1:05:37.958
And because it is
a phased-out metal,

1:05:38.042 --> 1:05:40.458
it is not a modern metal
by any means.

1:05:40.583 --> 1:05:43.250
16th century onwards,
it's nonexistent.

1:05:44.292 --> 1:05:46.458
They stopped making

1:05:46.542 --> 1:05:48.542
-this type of metal
in the 1500s?
-They stopped making it...

1:05:48.708 --> 1:05:50.167
Yes.

1:05:50.292 --> 1:05:51.958
-(chuckles): Yes.
-That is absolutely brilliant.

1:05:52.083 --> 1:05:53.000
EMMA:
It is...

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:54.125
it is pretty old.

1:05:54.208 --> 1:05:55.417
(chuckles softly)
Yeah.

<i>NARRATOR:

<i>If so, could it offer
more evidence</i>

1:06:05.375 --> 1:06:08.375

<i>may have been behind
the Oak Island mystery?</i>

1:06:12.458 --> 1:06:14.583
It was common for coins.

1:06:14.708 --> 1:06:18.583
But it was also used for swords.
It was used for statues.

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:20.333
But the shape...

1:06:20.458 --> 1:06:22.833
(chuckles softly) ...really
reminiscent of a coin here.

1:06:22.958 --> 1:06:24.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it is. I knew it!

1:06:24.292 --> 1:06:26.500
-(chuckling)
-It's quite exciting.

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:28.667
-Yeah, it is.
-Quite-quite-quite fascinating.

1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:31.333
It's certainly interesting
enough. I-I think Marty

1:06:31.417 --> 1:06:33.167
would like to know about this.
He's all about the data.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:36.167
So let me-- let me see
if he's available.

1:06:36.292 --> 1:06:38.417
(FaceTime ringing)

1:06:39.917 --> 1:06:40.958
Hey.

1:06:42.417 --> 1:06:44.167
Hey. Uh, we're here

1:06:44.292 --> 1:06:47.292
in the lab with Emma and Laird
and Jack and Gary.

1:06:47.417 --> 1:06:49.917
They found something.
But it's more than a something.

1:06:50.042 --> 1:06:51.500
It's quite interesting.

1:06:51.625 --> 1:06:54.500
Uh, Emma has run it through
the XRD and the XRF.

1:06:54.625 --> 1:06:56.208
I'm gonna let her
tell you about it.

1:06:57.667 --> 1:06:59.000
EMMA:
So, Gary and Jack found

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:00.833
this small rectangular object

1:07:00.958 --> 1:07:02.292
that I ran through the XRF,

1:07:02.375 --> 1:07:05.708
and the materials
that came out has copper,

1:07:05.833 --> 1:07:08.792
tin, zinc and a pretty high
arsenic content,

1:07:08.875 --> 1:07:12.208
which is a very unique
material composition.

1:07:13.292 --> 1:07:14.542
Those exact material properties

1:07:14.708 --> 1:07:17.500
indicate a metal
that was phased out

1:07:17.667 --> 1:07:19.500
at least in the 16th century.

1:07:19.667 --> 1:07:21.167
So,

1:07:21.292 --> 1:07:22.750
it is a really unique piece,

1:07:22.875 --> 1:07:24.500
and it really stands out.

1:07:28.042 --> 1:07:30.375
(chuckling)

1:07:33.542 --> 1:07:35.000
No.

1:07:35.125 --> 1:07:38.000
It's a very unique property,
'cause it did get phased out

1:07:38.125 --> 1:07:40.917
because it's so harmful
to humans.

1:07:42.167 --> 1:07:44.042
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-(chuckling)

1:07:44.167 --> 1:07:45.375

It's-it's quite unique.

1:07:45.542 --> 1:07:46.917
There's no question about it.

All right.

1:07:53.542 --> 1:07:54.667

IAN:
Bit of a recap-- last year,

1:09:22.875 --> 1:09:24.583
we found the gold in the water.
That was a surprise.

1:09:24.708 --> 1:09:28.250
So, the whole idea was
to put together a program

1:09:28.375 --> 1:09:29.542
in which
we could both understand

1:09:29.708 --> 1:09:31.167
how water was moving
in the Money Pit

1:09:31.333 --> 1:09:34.667
and to test this idea

1:09:34.750 --> 1:09:38.500
that there's a source of gold
in the Money Pit

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:39.792
and that's what's creating
the gold anomaly.

1:09:39.875 --> 1:09:42.833
-Yes.
-'Cause if it's naturally here,

1:09:42.958 --> 1:09:45.500
has nothing to do with humans,
it shouldn't be a small...

1:09:45.667 --> 1:09:47.958
area where it's concentrated.

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:49.625
That's really intriguing.

We've sampled wells
within the Money Pit area.

political, to mark events.

1:18:53.833 --> 1:18:56.375

1:18:56.542 --> 1:18:58.250

1:19:02.042 --> 1:19:05.333
<i>This cave actually proves
the narrative</i>

1:19:05.417 --> 1:19:08.833
<i>that the Templars came
to the New World,</i>

1:19:08.958 --> 1:19:11.208
<i>specifically to Oak Island,</i>

1:19:11.333 --> 1:19:13.333

1:19:13.417 --> 1:19:15.667

<i>NARRATOR:
Although Gretchen is not
the first to propose the theory</i>

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.042
<i>that the Knights Templar were
behind the Oak Island mystery,</i>

1:19:27.208 --> 1:19:31.000
<i>could the clues that she claims
reside in Royston Cave</i>

1:19:31.083 --> 1:19:33.458
<i>help explain the discoveries
made on the island,</i>

1:19:33.542 --> 1:19:36.417
<i>which may date back
to the Templar era,</i>

1:19:36.542 --> 1:19:38.708
<i>such as the paved area
in the swamp,</i>

1:19:38.833 --> 1:19:42.083
<i>which has been dated to 1200 AD,</i>

1:19:42.208 --> 1:19:45.833
<i>the recent finds

1:19:45.958 --> 1:19:48.917
<i>the 14th-century lead cross,</i>

1:19:49.042 --> 1:19:51.083
<i>which was verified
to have originated</i>

1:19:51.208 --> 1:19:53.917
<i>in a Templar stronghold
in Southern France,</i>

1:19:54.042 --> 1:19:58.500
<i>or even perhaps the high trace
evidence of silver and gold</i>

1:19:58.583 --> 1:20:00.667
<i>deep in the Money Pit?</i>

1:20:01.417 --> 1:20:03.208
Here's what I read
from what you're saying--

1:20:03.375 --> 1:20:05.833
that it-it's something
that needs to be experienced.

1:20:05.958 --> 1:20:07.750
-Is that correct?
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

1:20:07.875 --> 1:20:10.083
<i>That was how it was intended.</i>

1:20:10.208 --> 1:20:12.333
<i>But I would like to</i>

1:20:12.458 --> 1:20:14.250
invite you

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:15.458

1:20:19.667 --> 1:20:21.292
<i>see what you think.</i>

1:20:21.375 --> 1:20:24.208
Well, at-at the risk of
b-borrowing my brother's line,

1:20:24.333 --> 1:20:25.667
"Eyes and boots time."

1:20:25.750 --> 1:20:27.000
-That was good.
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

1:20:27.125 --> 1:20:28.250
MARTY:
A visit to Royston Cave sounds

1:20:28.375 --> 1:20:29.792
very, very interesting.

1:20:29.875 --> 1:20:31.000
Absolutely.

1:20:31.083 --> 1:20:32.417
MARTY:
Great. This would be

1:20:32.542 --> 1:20:33.875
a perfect mission
for Alex and I,

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:35.250
because we are
sort of the skeptics

1:20:35.375 --> 1:20:36.833
about the Templar connection.

1:20:36.958 --> 1:20:38.708
We're gonna plan a trip.

1:20:38.833 --> 1:20:40.042
<i>Splendid.</i>

1:20:41.792 --> 1:20:43.833
-MARTY and CRAIG: Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.417
-And please stay in touch.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

1:20:45.542 --> 1:20:47.250
<i>You, too.</i>

1:20:47.375 --> 1:20:48.833
RICK:
Should be interesting.
I look forward to,

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:50.333
um, what you learn.

1:20:50.417 --> 1:20:51.167
Okay.

1:20:51.250 --> 1:20:53.042
<i>Royston Cave,</i>

1:20:53.208 --> 1:20:54.833
as described by Gretchen,

1:20:54.958 --> 1:20:57.208
sounds very, very interesting.

1:20:57.333 --> 1:21:01.208
<i>It's clearly at a place
that has ancient roots.</i>

1:21:01.333 --> 1:21:02.958
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

1:21:03.042 --> 1:21:04.500
So it kind of sounds like,
if you figure out,

1:21:04.583 --> 1:21:06.917
you know, all the symbolism
inside the cave,

1:21:07.042 --> 1:21:08.625
that we can actually find
the Templar treasure

1:21:08.708 --> 1:21:10.792
here on the island.
So, no pressure, Marty.

1:21:10.875 --> 1:21:12.167
-MARTY: No.

<i>RICK:
Here's an opportunity</i>

1:21:14.042 --> 1:21:17.292
<i>presented
by a very valued researcher,</i>

1:21:17.417 --> 1:21:20.042
to come visit
a very historic site,

1:21:20.167 --> 1:21:22.000

1:21:22.083 --> 1:21:24.542

my brother and Alex

1:21:24.708 --> 1:21:26.208
from skeptic to believer.

1:21:26.333 --> 1:21:27.958
You know, we spoke
about the importance

1:21:28.083 --> 1:21:29.542
of doing research.

1:21:29.667 --> 1:21:31.667
We have heard that exhaustively
over the years.

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:34.958
And so I would recommend,
if you find the time,

1:21:35.083 --> 1:21:36.375
to meet with Paul Stewart.

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:38.208
-Uh, he's very knowledgeable.
-Yeah.

1:21:38.333 --> 1:21:40.333
Very, very accomplished
researcher.

1:21:40.458 --> 1:21:43.583
He's researched
at the British Museum at Kew,

1:21:43.708 --> 1:21:45.583
looking for any connections
to Oak Island.

1:21:45.708 --> 1:21:48.208
MARTY: (chuckles) Yeah,
all right. Sounds good as well.

1:21:48.375 --> 1:21:49.708
So it is written.

1:21:49.833 --> 1:21:52.167
