00:00.350 --> 00:02.279
Previously on "Brothers and Sisters"...

00:02.280 --> 00:05.919
I thought it might be nice if people
brought their dogs to work occasionally.

00:05.920 --> 00:06.490
You--nice?

00:06.490 --> 00:07.139
I sent an e-mail.

00:07.140 --> 00:07.889
You did what?

00:07.890 --> 00:09.329
Come up to my place in Santa Barbara.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.519
I don't date potential employers.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.009
You'll have lunch and a
professional conversation.

00:14.010 --> 00:17.289
If you consider that a date, then
your social life must be pretty lame.

00:17.298 --> 00:18.250
It is.

00:18.263 --> 00:19.347
We're having a baby.

00:19.356 --> 00:21.535
Oh!

00:22.014 --> 00:23.246
I am trying to be a good mother to him.

00:23.259 --> 00:25.110
I know that's what he wants when he's here.

00:25.126 --> 00:25.763
He has a mother.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.163
Yeah, but she's not here, is she, joe?

00:27.175 --> 00:27.971
And I am.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.432
Why are you leaving?

00:29.448 --> 00:31.192
I've had some bad ideas in my life,

00:31.206 --> 00:35.240
but thinking I could work here and share
an office with you is one of the worst.

00:35.255 --> 00:36.290
How ya doing?

00:36.307 --> 00:37.450
No,I work here now.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.821
I'm not kidding.

00:46.318 --> 00:54.483
<i>I know you been working hard all week
so won't you come on and lay with me?</i>

00:56.186 --> 00:57.482
Hey,stud.

00:58.115 --> 00:58.890
Hey.

00:58.907 --> 01:00.640
Whoa,blind stud.

01:00.657 --> 01:02.252
Soap in my eye.

01:03.375 --> 01:06.120
Sorry, but what you did back there?

01:06.137 --> 01:08.760
It was incredible.

01:09.866 --> 01:13.040
You sure it was me and not the hormones?

01:13.058 --> 01:14.741
Oh, it was you, all right.

01:16.318 --> 01:18.210
Well, I do aim to please.

01:18.565 --> 01:21.750
Good, because I'm nowhere
near finished with you.

01:23.446 --> 01:26.582
I barely left the house most sundays.

01:26.597 --> 01:33.160
My mom would cook elaborate dinners for
neighbors, friends and sometimes people we barely knew.

01:33.616 --> 01:39.350
By 10, I could whip up a perfect
meringue, deglaze a pan, truss a chicken.

01:39.747 --> 01:43.070
But by the time puberty
rolled around, I'd had enough.

01:43.087 --> 01:45.960
Football, friends seemed more important.

01:45.977 --> 01:48.041
So I told her I was done.

01:48.306 --> 01:49.081
I mean, I was a guy.

01:49.098 --> 01:51.962
I didn't want to spend sundays
in the kitchen with my mom.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.832
And you know what she said?

01:53.845 --> 01:59.923
She told me that someday I would realize that
taking care of people is not masculine or feminine.

01:59.937 --> 02:02.802
It's a privilege and it's an honor.

02:02.816 --> 02:04.101
And she was right.

02:04.118 --> 02:09.960
Then one day I realized that politics is about the
privilege and the honor of taking care of people

02:09.975 --> 02:16.403
of making certain that the weak are protected,the
poor are sheltered and the hungry fed.

02:17.018 --> 02:20.203
My mother passed away six years ago, but I work every day to honor her memory in politics and in my kitchen.

02:25.395 --> 02:25.992
Well,thank you.

02:25.998 --> 02:27.323
I appreciate the support.

02:27.335 --> 02:28.223
It's good to see you.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.072
Weren't you impressed?

02:30.086 --> 02:32.141
Well, you were talking to a room full of republican women.

02:32.157 --> 02:34.463
What did you think, they were gonna storm the stage?

02:34.477 --> 02:35.941
Look, this is your first week.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.303
Shouldn't you be kissing up to me a little more?

02:37.317 --> 02:41.161
There is nothing sexier than a man who loves his mom.

02:41.696 --> 02:43.351
I'm glad you enjoyed the speech.

02:43.366 --> 02:46.733
You are so much better-looking in person than you are on c-span.

02:46.746 --> 02:47.861
Oh.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.641
Nobody looks good on c-span, believe me.

02:49.655 --> 02:50.402
It's the lighting.

02:50.415 --> 02:53.421
Oh,those baby blues cheekbones that could cut glass.

02:53.435 --> 02:54.890
Financies are impeccable.

02:54.906 --> 02:57.821
I'd have to rate you a 94.5

02:57.836 --> 02:59.742
I have to take off something for the divorce.

02:59.757 --> 03:02.161
But thank goodness you were the cheatee, not the cheater.

03:02.176 --> 03:02.758
I'm sorry.

03:02.758 --> 03:04.252
Excuse me, but who are you?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.191
"Introductions by elise."

03:06.206 --> 03:07.420
"Introductions"?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.891
I ntro--oh!

03:08.905 --> 03:11.672
Oh,you're a...you're a dating service.

03:11.685 --> 03:13.551
Executive matchmaker.

03:13.567 --> 03:16.401
And a very large contributor.

03:16.418 --> 03:18.021
Look, I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

03:18.035 --> 03:21.192
You are the 200-pound tuna of bachelors, senator,

03:21.207 --> 03:24.112
and you really don't have time to separate the
 wheat from the chaff, you know,

03:24.126 --> 03:27.250
the Grace Kellys from the Britney Spears,
and that's where I come in.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.202
Senator, we need to go meet the governor.

03:29.218 --> 03:30.261
It's very nice meeting you.

03:30.275 --> 03:31.732
Lovely to meet you.

03:32.586 --> 03:33.371
Think about it.

03:33.386 --> 03:34.230
You bet.

03:34.246 --> 03:35.271
Give me that.

03:35.288 --> 03:36.632
You didn't find her persuasive?

03:36.648 --> 03:37.421
Persuasive? No.

03:37.437 --> 03:39.361
Objectifying, pushy, judgmental, yes.

03:39.376 --> 03:41.200
She is trying to bring people together.

03:41.216 --> 03:42.421
That is noble work.

03:42.437 --> 03:44.331
She looked at you like you were a piece of meat.

03:44.348 --> 03:45.412
Tuna, actually.

03:45.425 --> 03:49.263
- If the press ever got wind of you using a madam 
- it's an executive matchmaker.

03:49.278 --> 03:49.705
Fine.

03:49.705 --> 03:50.790
They're gonna have a field day.

03:50.808 --> 03:53.542
And by the way, can you think of a less romantic way to meet someone?

03:54.128 --> 03:57.200
Oh, what, you want to be reduced to an 
arbitrary number on an arbitrary scale?

03:57.215 --> 03:58.942
Y-you are try to get to me.

03:58.956 --> 04:02.052
No, not trying, succeeding ,and spectacularly, I might add.

04:02.066 --> 04:03.440
You realize I hate you right now?

04:04.586 --> 04:05.521
Come on, ladies, come on!

04:05.537 --> 04:07.031
Show me something down here!

04:07.638 --> 04:09.630
Oh, life's a fight, people!

04:09.646 --> 04:11.160
Let's see some fightin' spirit in here!

04:11.808 --> 04:13.233
Just five more, soldier!

04:15.295 --> 04:16.231
Five!

04:17.588 --> 04:18.422
Four!

04:19.505 --> 04:20.750
Three!

04:21.875 --> 04:22.503
Five!

04:22.516 --> 04:23.780
Two comes after three!

04:24.087 --> 04:24.930
Four!

04:26.246 --> 04:27.170
Three!

04:28.116 --> 04:28.952
Two!

04:30.137 --> 04:31.213
One!

04:34.846 --> 04:36.462
I can't believe he sat on me.

04:37.766 --> 04:39.232
Is that a common occurrence?

04:39.246 --> 04:40.743
You haven't taken benny before?

04:40.756 --> 04:41.752
No.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.701
He gets off on being a hard-ass.

04:45.848 --> 04:47.081
It's my first week.

04:47.098 --> 04:48.291
With those arms, bro?

04:48.306 --> 04:49.473
You could've fooled me.

04:50.526 --> 04:51.120
Nice to meet you.

04:51.138 --> 04:51.698
Chad.

04:51.698 --> 04:52.712
Kevin.

04:53.305 --> 04:54.570
Nice kicks, by the way.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.623
Where'd you get 'em?

04:55.635 --> 04:57.360
Some place on Melrose.

04:58.856 --> 05:01.570
I'm waiting for these limited edition japanese imports.

05:01.586 --> 05:04.561
They got, like, blue and orange on the side 
and this cool red mesh on the soles.

05:04.576 --> 05:06.803
I had my publicist put me on the list.

05:06.817 --> 05:07.920
They sound great.

05:08.996 --> 05:10.843
I could ask her to put you on it, too, if you want.

05:10.858 --> 05:12.880
If you don't mind matching, that is.

05:13.485 --> 05:14.462
No. Sure.

05:14.477 --> 05:15.232
Right on.

05:15.245 --> 05:16.431
I'll need your info, though.

05:17.058 --> 05:17.608
Oh.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.092
I'm so sorry.

05:19.108 --> 05:20.492
You're Dr Phillip, right?

05:20.507 --> 05:21.471
From "Tempest Bay"?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.043
That's me.

05:22.043 --> 05:25.277
I know it's completely hicksville, but 
would you sign my gym bag?

05:25.286 --> 05:26.315
Sure, no problem.

05:26.324 --> 05:27.516
Thanks.

05:32.179 --> 05:33.122
Oh,my god.

05:33.138 --> 05:34.722
My mom's gonna flip out.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.453
Bye.

05:35.466 --> 05:35.896
Bye.

05:35.896 --> 05:36.623
Bye.

05:40.415 --> 05:41.892
Too bad it's always the moms, right?

05:41.908 --> 05:42.992
Yeah, bummer.

05:45.298 --> 05:46.432
he was hitting on me.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.113
You are so full of yourself.

05:48.128 --> 05:51.481
Chad barry has had, like, ten girlfriends in the last year.

05:51.498 --> 05:52.037
What?

05:52.037 --> 05:52.971
I'm a mom.

05:52.988 --> 05:54.262
I read "us weekly."

05:54.277 --> 05:55.821
It's too bad justin's in rehab.

05:55.838 --> 05:56.773
He has great gaydar.

05:56.786 --> 05:59.912
Well, straight guys don't really comment on other guy's bodies.

05:59.928 --> 06:01.852
Then why did you tell kevin he was getting a gut?

06:01.866 --> 06:02.457
Yeah.

06:02.457 --> 06:03.332
Well, he's my brother.

06:03.346 --> 06:04.150
That's...that's different.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.800
I say "go for it".

06:06.666 --> 06:08.523
Since when have you been so sex positive?

06:08.538 --> 06:10.931
Well, julia's morning sickness is gone.

06:10.948 --> 06:11.543
Oh, it has?

06:11.556 --> 06:12.126
That's so great.

06:12.126 --> 06:12.912
Yeah.

06:12.927 --> 06:14.201
Really great.

06:15.688 --> 06:16.470
Oh.

06:16.488 --> 06:17.693
I remember that.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.592
When I was pregnant with Cooper, Joe would just, like, 
brush past me, and I was

06:22.317 --> 06:23.463
Enjoy it while it lasts.

06:23.476 --> 06:24.400
Believe me, it won't.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.332
Oh, thanks for the tip, killjoy.

06:26.347 --> 06:27.611
Oh, look.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.441
He brought his mom to the Daytime Emmys.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.651
Everyone does that now.

06:30.668 --> 06:32.010
Yeah, everyone who's gay.

06:32.028 --> 06:33.062
that's julia.

06:33.075 --> 06:36.050
She wants me home for, um, lunch.

06:36.065 --> 06:36.852
- Later. - lunch.

06:37.937 --> 06:39.532
He's got a blog.

06:40.746 --> 06:44.123
"Favorite music-- all things christina."

06:44.136 --> 06:44.922
You might be right.

06:44.937 --> 06:45.702
Yeah.

06:55.446 --> 06:56.450
Kitty walker?

06:57.295 --> 06:58.910
Gary morris, policy advisor.

06:58.925 --> 06:59.840
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:59.857 --> 07:00.641
Nice to meet you.

07:00.658 --> 07:02.061
I was a big fan of "red,white & blue."

07:02.077 --> 07:03.041
Welcome aboard.

07:03.056 --> 07:03.761
Oh,well,thanks.

07:03.777 --> 07:05.091
I'm happy to be here.

07:05.106 --> 07:05.883
Yeah.

07:05.895 --> 07:10.152
Uh, between you and me, some of the staff 
are concerned about you coming to work for us.

07:10.165 --> 07:12.661
- But,uh,so long as you're discreet 
- well,I'm sorry.

07:12.677 --> 07:13.450
Um, excuse me.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.010
- I'm not sure that I follow
 - oh,sorry.

07:15.026 --> 07:15.931
I need to take this.

07:15.946 --> 07:17.830
Noreen, can you help kitty get settled?

07:17.845 --> 07:18.912
Thanks.

07:18.926 --> 07:20.903
Your office is this way.

07:21.787 --> 07:23.513
Not quite what you're used to, huh?

07:23.528 --> 07:26.201
No makeup, no stylists.

07:26.215 --> 07:29.032
This office is seriously lacking in glamour.

07:30.628 --> 07:33.193
Well, uh, I worked in basic cable, so...

07:33.208 --> 07:33.990
ooh.

07:34.837 --> 07:35.950
No glamour there.

07:35.967 --> 07:38.410
- If you need anything else - uh,yeah.

07:38.426 --> 07:44.840
Actually, um, is there any reason why people 
would be uncomfortable with me being here?

07:44.858 --> 07:45.760
No reason.

07:45.775 --> 07:46.911
It's great.

07:46.926 --> 07:47.802
But I'm swamped.

07:47.815 --> 07:48.571
I should go.

07:48.587 --> 07:49.048
No,no.

07:49.048 --> 07:49.682
No,please.

07:49.696 --> 07:52.933
I mean, really, I-I feel like I have spinach in 
my teeth and nobody's telling me.

07:53.896 --> 07:55.992
We all just really care about the senator.

07:56.818 --> 07:59.263
Personally, I think you make a really cute couple.

07:59.276 --> 07:59.872
Couple?

07:59.888 --> 08:00.702
C-uple?

08:00.718 --> 08:01.236
No.

08:01.236 --> 08:01.852
No,no,no,no,no.

08:01.868 --> 08:03.611
We are--that--that--no.

08:03.626 --> 08:04.882
There's no couple.

08:04.895 --> 08:06.840
I mean, I'm just part of his communications staff.

08:06.858 --> 08:08.470
There's no coupling.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.291
I get it.

08:09.308 --> 08:10.781
You want to keep it on the down low.

08:10.796 --> 08:11.125
No.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.262
I don't--I don't want to keep it on the down.

08:12.277 --> 08:13.272
I don't want to keep it on the low.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.463
I don't want to keep it anywhere.

08:14.477 --> 08:16.223
There's nothing to keep anywhere anyway.

08:16.237 --> 08:18.353
I arranged for you to go up to his ranch for the weekend.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.191
Oh,no. For the day.

08:19.787 --> 08:20.277
For the day.

08:20.277 --> 08:21.180
It was one day.

08:21.197 --> 08:23.493
And actually, it turned into just a couple of hours.

08:23.505 --> 08:25.303
Look, he's been through a lot.

08:25.318 --> 08:26.762
Just don't break his heart,okay?

08:26.777 --> 08:33.041
Oh,my--I-I just-- you know, what can I say to you to make you understand that we are not together?

08:33.057 --> 08:34.942
You know, if you don't believe me, you can ask...

08:36.525 --> 08:38.581
ask my boyfriend.

08:39.755 --> 08:40.681
You have a boyfriend?

08:40.695 --> 08:42.111
Yes, I do.

08:42.128 --> 08:43.201
It's very serious.

08:43.217 --> 08:44.142
I love him.

08:45.365 --> 08:46.470
I'm sorry.I...

08:47.086 --> 08:49.143
I guess it was just a misunderstanding.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.652
I'll let you settle in.

08:51.667 --> 08:52.453
Yeah, okay.

08:52.468 --> 08:55.743
And--and please feel free to spread the word.

09:04.427 --> 09:06.583
oh,no.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.343
Listen to this.

09:32.356 --> 09:36.223
"Spend two weeks at a 16th century tuscan farmhouse."

09:36.235 --> 09:40.980
Each night you prepare an authentic italian meal,learning from local chefs.

09:42.367 --> 09:43.070
Interested?

09:43.087 --> 09:44.123
Two weeks cooking?

09:44.136 --> 09:47.653
Are you-- what--what part of "vacation" do you not understand?

09:47.668 --> 09:49.103
Are you expecting a fax?

09:49.118 --> 09:49.833
Well,no.

09:49.847 --> 09:50.833
I mean,yes,I am.

09:50.906 --> 09:52.580
Papers from my office.

09:52.596 --> 09:54.592
Kitty, don't lie.

09:54.605 --> 09:57.633
You've got a tell-- that funny thing you do with your eyebrows.

09:57.645 --> 09:59.681
I-I don't do a little thing with my eyebrows.

09:59.696 --> 10:01.030
This came in a few minutes ago.

10:01.045 --> 10:01.751
Oh, great, mother.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.390
Thank you for making an embarrassing situation even more embarrassing.

10:05.408 --> 10:07.242
A dating service,kitty?

10:07.258 --> 10:07.808
Oh,no.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.873
You don't need a dating service.

10:08.885 --> 10:10.261
No,I actually do.

10:10.278 --> 10:13.840
- I need a quick and expedient way to find 
- a husband?

10:13.858 --> 10:16.060
No,mother,not a husband.

10:16.075 --> 10:20.061
Sweetheart,there are other ways of fulfilling your physical needs.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.333
There are electrical things

10:21.348 --> 10:22.123
Mother,no,please!

10:22.136 --> 10:22.515
What?

10:22.515 --> 10:23.843
Oh,somebody,just kill me!

10:23.857 --> 10:24.582
Okay,all right.

10:24.597 --> 10:27.880
- If it's not a husband, and it's not sex, then why are you 
- it's--it's a beard.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.013
Arm candy.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.260
I need somebody whose picture I can put on my desk,

10:31.278 --> 10:35.201
because everybody in my office thinks that the senator and I are dating.

10:35.216 --> 10:36.613
Well,he is your type.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.860
Oh,et tu,mother?

10:37.878 --> 10:39.190
All right,I'm sorry.

10:39.207 --> 10:40.441
Just please continue.

10:40.455 --> 10:42.991
All right.Well,I really want to do well at this job,

10:43.005 --> 10:47.281
and I can't do well if everybody thinks 
that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.

10:47.298 --> 10:50.952
So if you will excuse me,I am meeting with the E.M.

10:50.968 --> 10:52.621
- Very shortly,and I 
- "E.M."?

10:52.638 --> 10:54.412
It's the executive matchmaker.

10:54.428 --> 10:56.490
Now silence,mother.

11:13.275 --> 11:14.300
you want help with that bar?

11:16.568 --> 11:17.162
Hey.

11:17.175 --> 11:18.030
Oh,hey.

11:18.046 --> 11:18.793
You made it.

11:18.806 --> 11:19.811
Yeah.

11:20.066 --> 11:23.110
I didn't want major pain to make me do 
extra push-ups,so I ran here.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.551
Hey, check 'em out.

11:25.568 --> 11:27.932
Oh, yeah, the--nice.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.551
Yeah,I got yours in my bag.

11:29.566 --> 11:30.156
Great.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.421
You'll need to break 'em in,though.

11:31.438 --> 11:33.600
What are you doing tomorrow, say around 11:00?

11:33.615 --> 11:34.951
Oh,I-I work.

11:34.966 --> 11:36.111
I'm a--I'm a lawyer.

11:36.127 --> 11:37.342
That's too bad.

11:37.357 --> 11:39.670
Not that you're a lawyer,that you're not free.

11:39.687 --> 11:42.651
Oh,well,you know,I-I-I work pretty flexible hours.

11:42.665 --> 11:43.420
Cool.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.410
So we'll,uh,skip class tomorrow and go hiking.

11:46.427 --> 11:48.841
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.

11:48.858 --> 11:50.043
Ah,come on,man,it'll be fun.

11:50.056 --> 11:51.711
I know this great off-leash trail we can hit.

11:51.727 --> 11:53.410
Uh,I don't have a dog.

11:53.427 --> 11:55.283
I do...Lola,my pug.

11:55.295 --> 11:57.280
You have a pug named lola?

11:57.298 --> 11:57.717
Yep.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.981
Short for lolita.

11:59.456 --> 12:01.341
And she's getting pretty fat,dude.

12:02.578 --> 12:04.202
let's get those heart rates up!

12:04.218 --> 12:05.160
all right,let's go,guys.

12:05.177 --> 12:05.841
Come on now!

12:05.855 --> 12:07.140
Ten rounds,jumping jacks!

12:07.155 --> 12:07.587
Go!

12:07.587 --> 12:08.231
Up!

12:08.248 --> 12:08.963
Up!

12:08.977 --> 12:09.582
Up!

12:09.596 --> 12:10.470
Come on!

12:12.016 --> 12:13.731
ah,hello,ladies.

12:13.747 --> 12:14.761
Hi,mrs.Whedon.

12:14.778 --> 12:15.503
Hi,mom.

12:15.518 --> 12:16.383
Where's dad?

12:16.397 --> 12:18.183
He's in the kitchen with nicole's mom.

12:18.197 --> 12:23.622
Okay,those two fingers on those-- that,yeah,second fret...

12:23.638 --> 12:25.801
And your pinky goes on the third fret there,yeah.

12:25.815 --> 12:26.411
Hit it.

12:26.748 --> 12:27.410
Hit it again.

12:27.425 --> 12:29.102
yeah,rock star!

12:31.238 --> 12:31.853
hi.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.171
Sarah,hi.

12:33.205 --> 12:34.241
I'm vanessa.

12:34.625 --> 12:35.510
I'm sorry.

12:35.528 --> 12:37.852
I didn't realize you had a lesson,joe.

12:37.865 --> 12:41.390
Uh,no,it's just I was playing a few tunes,and,uh

12:41.405 --> 12:43.262
and I made the mistake of saying it looked easy.

12:43.277 --> 12:45.022
Well,it's nice to see the guitar out.

12:45.037 --> 12:47.643
It's been a while since it's had any recreational activity.

12:47.657 --> 12:48.621
Yeah.

12:50.195 --> 12:52.132
I--you know,I should get going.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.791
Time to round up my little warrior.

12:53.808 --> 12:55.170
Oh,she's great.

12:56.185 --> 12:56.950
I'll ring you tomorrow.

12:56.968 --> 12:57.920
Sounds good.

12:57.936 --> 12:59.933
It's so nice to finally meet you.

12:59.948 --> 13:00.843
You,too.

13:00.855 --> 13:02.220
Vanessa,right?

13:02.237 --> 13:03.102
Right.

13:03.878 --> 13:04.812
See ya.

13:09.548 --> 13:10.463
Don't tell me.

13:10.478 --> 13:11.903
You're jealous.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.843
Don't be ridiculous.

13:13.857 --> 13:16.151
Come on,she's just another mom.

13:21.388 --> 13:22.203
Lovely.

13:22.217 --> 13:23.640
Oh,my.

13:23.657 --> 13:25.733
This is so beautiful.

13:25.745 --> 13:27.840
You know,your home says a lot about you.

13:29.386 --> 13:31.740
Warm,nurturing.

13:31.757 --> 13:33.191
Homebody.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.671
It's my mom's.

13:35.418 --> 13:36.822
You live at home at your age?

13:36.838 --> 13:39.522
Oh,well,yeah,it's temporary.

13:39.535 --> 13:41.573
See,used to live in new york, and then I moved to L.A...

13:41.585 --> 13:45.241
you should have seen her first apartment-- steel and concrete.

13:45.255 --> 13:47.922
What is it with young people that want to live in a warehouse?

13:47.936 --> 13:48.610
Hi,I'm nora.

13:48.627 --> 13:49.207
How do you do?

13:49.207 --> 13:49.892
I'm elise.

13:49.906 --> 13:52.182
Mom,don't you have something that you need to do?

13:52.197 --> 13:52.792
I do.

13:52.795 --> 13:54.430
I'm organizing the linen chest.

13:54.445 --> 13:56.341
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

13:56.738 --> 13:59.283
So,elise,when do you think I'll have my first date?

13:59.297 --> 14:00.443
Don't get ahead of yourself.

14:00.455 --> 14:05.451
We do have some work to do on your dating techniques,your appearance,your hair.

14:05.465 --> 14:08.112
What--what's wrong with my hair?

14:08.126 --> 14:09.403
A little product wouldn't hurt.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.083
Mom,I don't need product.

14:11.098 --> 14:13.001
You know,just for a little volume.

14:13.017 --> 14:15.792
Now I need to prep you on what you're going to say.

14:15.806 --> 14:23.203
Oh,well,you know,I'm-- I know that I look young,but I've actually been dating for about 20 years,so I've

14:23.216 --> 14:25.363
and yet you've never sealed the deal.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.102
Well,maybe I've never wanted to...

14:28.116 --> 14:30.232
seal the deal.

14:30.248 --> 14:31.161
Don't be defensive.

14:31.178 --> 14:31.615
No,no.

14:31.615 --> 14:32.047
No,no.

14:32.047 --> 14:32.882
She gets defensive.

14:32.898 --> 14:33.570
No,no.

14:33.588 --> 14:34.852
I don't get defensive.

14:34.865 --> 14:35.426
I'm not defensive.I'm not!

14:35.426 --> 14:36.360
she gets defensive.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.022
Okay,okay,okay,ladies.

14:38.038 --> 14:42.913
I am gonna meet with you before every date,
and we're gonna check your clothes,your makeup,

14:42.925 --> 14:47.872
you know,to make sure that you're projecting the
 right image,you know,based on the bachelors.

14:47.885 --> 14:50.132
We'll go over mutual areas of interest.

14:50.145 --> 14:56.740
Now I have been going over your questionnaire,and it seems like your priorities are...

14:57.717 --> 14:59.862
Well,looks.

15:00.868 --> 15:01.562
Oh,no.

15:01.577 --> 15:03.150
That doesn't sound like you,kitty.

15:03.168 --> 15:03.780
No,it's me.

15:03.798 --> 15:04.402
It's me.

15:04.415 --> 15:05.873
It's--it's me.

15:05.887 --> 15:07.901
Oh,sweetheart,looks fade.

15:07.915 --> 15:14.393
You want someone intelligent who'll make you laugh,
and cultured so you can travel with him, go to the theater.

15:14.408 --> 15:16.171
Since when do I go to the theater?

15:16.185 --> 15:21.830
You know, Ms Walker,I just signed a client who sounds exactly like the man you're describing.

15:21.848 --> 15:22.730
He's charming.

15:22.745 --> 15:23.288
He's funny.

15:23.288 --> 15:29.452
I think he's about your age,never married,so you know he's not bitter,and he's an accomplished ballroom dancer.

15:29.465 --> 15:31.542
I think he would love to meet you.

15:32.088 --> 15:32.683
you know what?

15:32.686 --> 15:34.021
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

15:34.037 --> 15:34.853
No,no,no.

15:34.865 --> 15:35.573
No,no,no.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.381
This is about kitty's social life.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.180
I don't really want to intrude.

15:39.196 --> 15:40.973
Oh,trust me,she loves to intrude.

15:40.985 --> 15:42.361
She lives to intrude.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.063
nonsense.

15:44.075 --> 15:44.527
And you know what?

15:44.527 --> 15:45.612
I love mother/daughter teams.

15:45.628 --> 15:46.910
It's twice as much fun.

15:46.926 --> 15:47.436
Okay.

15:47.436 --> 15:50.370
Well,she loves contractors.

15:50.386 --> 15:51.192
Kitty.

15:51.205 --> 15:55.670
Nora, I feel so confident in this,
I am not gonna charge you for this consultation.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.800
Sit down.

15:57.785 --> 15:58.800
Sit.

16:00.158 --> 16:00.930
Great.

16:00.948 --> 16:01.842
Okay.

16:01.858 --> 16:03.011
Here's what we're gonna do.

16:06.987 --> 16:07.498
Hey.

16:07.498 --> 16:08.330
So this is really good.

16:08.346 --> 16:11.221
I would just change "watchdog" to "necessary vigilance."

16:12.726 --> 16:14.632
"Protection over fear."

16:14.647 --> 16:15.570
It's good.I like it.Sit down.

16:15.588 --> 16:16.731
I'll go over the whole thing.

16:16.748 --> 16:19.743
Well,you know,actually,I-- I kind of have to go.

16:19.758 --> 16:21.640
Is it okay if we run through it tomorrow?

16:21.657 --> 16:23.363
It's a personal matter.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.581
Okay.

16:24.595 --> 16:26.053
Okay,thanks.

16:27.516 --> 16:28.750
I hope I get to meet him soon.

16:29.407 --> 16:30.111
What?

16:30.126 --> 16:31.141
Your boyfriend.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.872
If you want to keep things private,you gotta avoid noreen.

16:33.886 --> 16:35.812
Ah,yeah,thanks.

16:35.826 --> 16:36.842
Thanks for the intel.

16:36.858 --> 16:39.450
You know,I have to say,I was surprised to hear that you were in a relationship.

16:40.175 --> 16:42.641
I just would have assumed you'd said something.

16:42.658 --> 16:44.823
You know,you're-- you're fishing.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.812
You're evading.

16:46.966 --> 16:47.591
It's only fair.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.790
You know all the gory details in my personal life.

16:49.808 --> 16:54.112
Besides,what's the big secret-- is he bald,a hunchback,a member of the green party?

16:56.366 --> 16:57.763
he doesn't exist.

16:57.776 --> 16:58.752
I don't have a boyfriend.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.702
I...

16:59.716 --> 17:06.082
lied because I-- well,I had to,because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are...

17:06.098 --> 17:06.801
they do?

17:06.817 --> 17:07.510
They do.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.400
But we're not.

17:08.415 --> 17:13.670
I'm aware of that,but every time I tried to tell noreen,she thought I was lying,so--

17:13.688 --> 17:15.183
so you had to make up another lie.

17:15.756 --> 17:17.190
You'd be a very effective politician.

17:17.205 --> 17:17.863
I panicked.

17:17.876 --> 17:18.933
I was--I was nervous.

17:18.945 --> 17:22.932
It was my first day, and I just-- you know,
I really want people in this office to respect me,

17:22.945 --> 17:26.462
- and they're not if-- if they think 
- one day,you're gonna have to come clean.

17:27.425 --> 17:30.070
Not if I meet somebody really soon.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.343
I called the matchmaker.

17:34.156 --> 17:36.491
The pushy,judgmental,objectifying matchmaker?

17:36.506 --> 17:37.890
Yeah,that would be the one.

17:37.905 --> 17:39.451
Oh,the irony of this moment.

17:39.468 --> 17:42.573
You know,can I just have a minute to enjoy this?

17:42.588 --> 17:44.563
Oh,knock yourself out.

17:44.578 --> 17:46.292
Oh,well,I can't enjoy it if you're gonna enjoy it.

17:47.287 --> 17:49.943
Kitty,you don't have to prove yourself to the staff.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.210
I mean,ignore 'em,or I can talk to them.

17:52.228 --> 17:52.537
No.

17:52.537 --> 17:52.995
No,no,no.

17:52.995 --> 17:53.347
No.

17:53.347 --> 17:54.093
No,no,no.

17:54.107 --> 17:54.645
Don't.

17:54.645 --> 17:55.752
It's fine.

17:55.768 --> 17:59.711
You know,I don't think that the office scuttlebutt 
was the only reason I called.

17:59.725 --> 18:02.050
You know,it is hard to meet people.

18:02.067 --> 18:02.731
Tell me about it.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.180
I met my wife at a kegger.

18:04.198 --> 18:07.172
I filled her plastic cup up with flat beer,and that was that.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.050
Today,I don't have the first idea where to meet women.

18:11.227 --> 18:13.800
If it makes you feel better,I was half-tempted to call her myself.

18:14.646 --> 18:15.312
Really?

18:16.245 --> 18:17.022
Well,yeah.

18:17.036 --> 18:19.850
Yeah,that--that does make me feel better.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.162
It's just that...

18:21.895 --> 18:26.843
well,I have never been one to believe that 
there's gonna be some knight in shining armor

18:26.858 --> 18:29.603
who pulls up into my driveway and sweeps me off of my feet.

18:29.618 --> 18:31.342
But,you know,I really...

18:31.958 --> 18:35.282
I really never thought that it was gonna be this hard,either.

18:40.615 --> 18:42.220
I-I have to go.

18:42.537 --> 18:47.433
So thank you for not being a complete jerk about this.

18:47.768 --> 18:48.670
Anytime.

18:50.077 --> 18:53.490
Oh,and,uh,wish me luck.

18:56.137 --> 19:00.213
And then I said,you know,look,I know I'm supposed to be 
humble,but I'm better than that show.

19:00.228 --> 19:02.951
I mean,I can do more than play a mafioso's son.

19:02.967 --> 19:06.701
At least give me a disease or a multiple personality or something.

19:06.718 --> 19:07.310
Yeah.

19:07.325 --> 19:08.430
I can see how that would be...

19:09.055 --> 19:09.627
frustratinG.

19:09.627 --> 19:13.281
So finally I just said to 'em,"look,I'm not renewing my 
contract," you know?

19:13.295 --> 19:14.053
yeah?

19:14.065 --> 19:16.221
So,kev,you got a boyfriend or something?

19:17.708 --> 19:19.122
Uh,n-no,no,I don't.

19:19.135 --> 19:20.392
And,uh,h-how...

19:21.697 --> 19:22.963
how did you know I was gay?

19:22.978 --> 19:24.350
I got a lot of gay friends.

19:25.056 --> 19:26.713
It's so much easier hanging out,you know?

19:26.726 --> 19:29.322
None of that alpha male weirdness.

19:29.337 --> 19:31.261
So you're--you're not?

19:31.277 --> 19:31.808
Gay?

19:31.808 --> 19:32.318
Yeah.

19:32.318 --> 19:33.061
No.

19:33.816 --> 19:36.661
But my girlfriend's got a theory we're all a little bit gay.

19:37.175 --> 19:37.677
Right.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.551
Well,um,right.

19:38.568 --> 19:39.673
Well,um...

19:41.657 --> 19:43.881
I'm pretty much fully gay,so...

19:43.895 --> 19:45.210
so you have a girlfriend?

19:45.226 --> 19:46.901
Yeah, Michelle.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.060
She's awesome.

19:48.077 --> 19:50.432
She's out in new york right now doing a play.

19:51.135 --> 19:52.361
You two would totally hit it off.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.123
She loves hot gay dudes.

19:54.135 --> 19:55.543
Always trying to convert 'em.

19:58.426 --> 20:00.481
He uh,you into the lakers?

20:00.497 --> 20:02.343
Uh,the-- the basketball team?

20:02.358 --> 20:05.520
My,uh,agent got me floor seats for tonight's game.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.391
We could go if you want,you know,grab a couple beers after.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.203
Yeah,sure.

20:09.217 --> 20:10.322
Cool.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.101
Come on!

20:11.118 --> 20:12.163
Let's go!

20:12.176 --> 20:13.210
Come on.

20:13.757 --> 20:14.751
Lola,come on!

20:15.246 --> 20:16.162
Come!

20:16.176 --> 20:17.660
Come on!

20:17.676 --> 20:18.912
There's a good girl.

20:20.548 --> 20:21.281
What a waste.

20:21.297 --> 20:24.363
You're going to one of the biggest games of the season,
and I'm stuck at home.

20:24.378 --> 20:25.331
"Stuck at home"?

20:25.346 --> 20:28.113
Every time I turn around,you're racing to get out of here.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.530
Yeah,but I'm exhausted.

20:29.805 --> 20:31.810
You know,julia woke me up at 5:00 A.M.?

20:31.826 --> 20:34.051
Not in the mood for an erotic wake-up call?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.903
Not at 5:00 A.M.

20:36.177 --> 20:38.450
This guy is messing with my head.

20:38.467 --> 20:42.730
In the gay column,I have flirting,giving me shoes,lola the pug,

20:42.745 --> 20:47.682
and in the straight column,I have girriend,lakers and use of the words "dude" and "bro."

20:47.695 --> 20:48.621
Maybe he's bi.

20:48.638 --> 20:49.423
No one's bi.

20:49.435 --> 20:51.631
Have you ever met a 70-year-old bisexual?

20:51.648 --> 20:55.672
At some point you make a choice,thus the expression,
"bi now,gay later."

20:55.687 --> 20:57.140
Maybe he hasn't decided yet.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.072
Well,he better decide soon.

20:58.085 --> 20:59.183
I can't keep missing work.

20:59.195 --> 21:01.040
My hamstrings are killing me.

21:01.057 --> 21:03.812
I don't know how I'm gonna make it up and down all the stairs at the coliseum.

21:04.175 --> 21:06.170
It's staples center,dumb-ass.

21:06.876 --> 21:09.051
Who knew too much sex could make you cranky?

21:09.068 --> 21:11.471
Wish I was cranky from too much sex.

21:11.486 --> 21:12.882
So what are you and joe up to tonight?

21:12.897 --> 21:14.343
We are going to a club.

21:15.087 --> 21:15.922
Yeah.

21:15.936 --> 21:18.382
This,um,band that joe used to love.

21:18.398 --> 21:20.052
How very twenty something of you.

21:20.065 --> 21:21.792
We're in serious need of fun.

21:22.446 --> 21:25.582
The last time I heard my husband laugh was with another mom.

21:25.596 --> 21:27.501
Another mom?

21:28.358 --> 21:29.961
Someone feeling a little possessive?

21:29.976 --> 21:30.872
Oh,please.

21:30.887 --> 21:32.282
She's hardly the issue.

21:32.295 --> 21:35.051
So this club,do they let parents in or is it seniors night?

21:35.928 --> 21:36.731
No.

21:38.596 --> 21:39.442
Oh,definitely no.

21:39.457 --> 21:40.051
Oh,well,come on now.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.063
Hey,that is my favorite date dress.

21:42.077 --> 21:43.433
No wonder you're still single.

21:44.057 --> 21:47.250
Kitty,you are going out with a very dynamic man.

21:47.267 --> 21:51.012
"Dynamic" isn't some sort of code word for "deranged," is it?

21:51.025 --> 21:52.033
God,no.

21:52.047 --> 21:57.422
You told me you wanted handsome,and I went 
above and beyond on this one.

21:57.435 --> 21:59.702
Oh,absolutely beautiful.

21:59.715 --> 22:01.672
Well,why does she get to wear black?

22:01.688 --> 22:04.923
She's a woman of a certain age,and it's classic.

22:07.387 --> 22:08.510
The earrings are wrong.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.823
What's wrong with pearls?

22:09.836 --> 22:12.562
Nothing,if you want to remind your date of his grandmother.

22:12.578 --> 22:13.293
Diamonds.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.290
Where are your diamonds?

22:14.305 --> 22:15.660
Is this too much?

22:17.037 --> 22:18.052
That's the one.

22:18.066 --> 22:22.610
And for the final touch,a gift for both of you.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.053
Chicken cutlets?

22:25.065 --> 22:25.943
No,they're boobs,mom.

22:25.956 --> 22:26.922
They're--they're boobs.

22:26.935 --> 22:30.642
No,I--I'm personally very happy with my body the way it is.

22:30.658 --> 22:34.650
Well,that's very progressive of you,but you pay 
me to tell it like I see it,

22:34.665 --> 22:37.223
and I see you both need a little help in this department.

22:37.238 --> 22:38.513
What's wrong with kleenex?

22:38.528 --> 22:39.902
well,because they're lumpy...

22:39.918 --> 22:41.362
that's stupid.

22:41.378 --> 22:45.550
And these,these are light and comfortable,and they have just the right amount of jiggle.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.123
See,I'm wearing them right now.

22:47.135 --> 22:48.330
Would you like to feel them?

22:48.347 --> 22:48.725
Oh,no,no.

22:48.725 --> 22:49.470
I'm good.

22:49.488 --> 22:50.102
Thanks.

22:50.115 --> 22:52.941
Oh,also you can use these for the posterior,
'cause let's face it,ladies,

22:52.957 --> 22:55.332
what man doesn't like a little junk in the trunk?

22:55.348 --> 22:56.382
So...

22:56.397 --> 22:57.632
oh,well...

22:57.645 --> 22:58.750
what do you say,girls?

22:58.766 --> 23:01.182
Who wants to be bootylicious?

23:01.196 --> 23:04.591
I think I'm bootylicious enough.

23:07.466 --> 23:09.022
Uh,hi.

23:09.037 --> 23:11.992
Excuse me,u I'm meeting someone here.

23:12.007 --> 23:14.722
Uh,the reservation was under elise lacey.

23:14.738 --> 23:16.750
Oh,hi.

23:16.765 --> 23:17.780
Your date's waiting for you.

23:17.796 --> 23:18.492
Follow me.

23:18.508 --> 23:19.851
Oh,really?

23:19.867 --> 23:20.743
Is...

23:20.755 --> 23:21.921
he normal?

23:22.396 --> 23:24.612
I wouldn't exactly say "normal."

23:24.628 --> 23:26.003
Really?

23:34.666 --> 23:36.291
You must be kitty.

23:38.926 --> 23:42.071
And I'll be back to tell you about the specials in just a minute,senator.

23:43.216 --> 23:46.191
*I never loved nobody fully...*

23:47.097 --> 23:50.071
you know,I never would have figured you 
for a silent-treatment type.

23:50.086 --> 23:51.470
I'm not giving you the silent treatment.

23:51.487 --> 23:54.952
I'm just sitting here carefully considering 
how I can tell you off without losing my job.

23:54.968 --> 23:55.545
You're angry.

23:55.545 --> 23:56.293
Yes!

23:56.306 --> 23:58.492
Yes,I'm angry.

23:58.507 --> 24:02.270
I thought it would be a nice surprise if 
you showed up and saw a friendly face

24:02.286 --> 24:05.120
I confided in you,and you took advantage of me.

24:05.135 --> 24:07.340
Do you know how humiliating this is?

24:07.355 --> 24:08.682
You don't need to feel humiliated.

24:08.696 --> 24:11.392
I am wearing a silicone ass!

24:11.407 --> 24:13.350
I knew there was something different about you.

24:13.366 --> 24:13.815
You know what?

24:13.815 --> 24:14.395
No,no,no.

24:14.395 --> 24:15.833
I don't appreciate your jokes.

24:16.546 --> 24:18.610
I thought that you were a decent human being.

24:18.627 --> 24:19.402
Kitty...

24:20.118 --> 24:21.310
hear me out.

24:21.778 --> 24:26.463
I just felt terrible that you went through all this 
because my staff made assumptions about us.

24:26.478 --> 24:27.910
So you hijacked my date.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.341
I didn't trust elise to find anybody good enough for you,

24:30.357 --> 24:35.052
and rather than have you sit through some 
awkward meal with a complete stranger,

24:35.067 --> 24:39.361
and me at home with my laptop and take-out thai,
I hijacked your date.

24:40.818 --> 24:41.881
I thought you'd find it charming.

24:41.895 --> 24:42.751
Charming?

24:43.467 --> 24:44.872
Accept my apology.

24:45.168 --> 24:48.550
My intentions were noble,albeit my execution was--

24:48.567 --> 24:51.982
lame,ill-conceived,thoughtless.

24:51.995 --> 24:53.473
All of the above,yes.

24:55.416 --> 24:56.212
Look...

24:57.935 --> 24:59.271
I can't date you.

25:01.165 --> 25:01.942
I know.

25:02.348 --> 25:06.933
But maybe you could share some red wine and a steak 
with me as a friend?

25:07.495 --> 25:08.930
Do you have your speech with you?

25:08.948 --> 25:11.092
You want to turn this into a working dinner?

25:11.107 --> 25:11.702
Yeah.

25:11.705 --> 25:12.185
Yeah,I do.

25:12.185 --> 25:13.782
I think it would make me feel better.

25:13.798 --> 25:15.040
I already memorized it.

25:15.058 --> 25:15.608
Good.

25:15.608 --> 25:17.000
Then I'll excuse myself.

25:17.015 --> 25:21.732
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room,and I'm going 
to remove my new,improved butt.

25:22.248 --> 25:27.162
And I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad,and then we'll-- we'll get to work.

25:27.178 --> 25:28.161
Will do.

25:28.177 --> 25:30.323
Apology accepted.

25:40.846 --> 25:41.932
you must be nora.

25:41.946 --> 25:42.772
Yes.

25:42.786 --> 25:43.850
Lawrence magill.

25:43.866 --> 25:45.193
Very nice to meet you.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.063
My god,look at those earrings.

25:48.076 --> 25:50.523
Let me guess-- a karat and a half.

25:50.536 --> 25:51.125
Uh,yeah.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.590
Uh,are you a jeweler?

25:52.605 --> 25:53.015
No.

25:53.015 --> 25:55.393
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.

25:56.436 --> 25:57.252
Yes.

25:57.268 --> 25:58.671
Please forgive me.

25:58.686 --> 26:00.493
I'm a little nervous about all this.

26:00.507 --> 26:01.901
You're a virgin.

26:01.918 --> 26:02.532
Hardly.

26:02.546 --> 26:04.241
I-I have five children.

26:04.256 --> 26:06.543
I mean a dating service virgin.

26:06.555 --> 26:08.462
Oh,y--well,yes,I-I am.

26:08.475 --> 26:09.270
Are you?

26:09.287 --> 26:09.876
Oh,no.

26:09.876 --> 26:11.931
I'm an old whore at this point.

26:11.947 --> 26:13.021
Lots of first dates.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.163
Seconds,not so much.

26:15.176 --> 26:17.901
Uh,I think,uh,our table is ready.

26:17.915 --> 26:19.983
We should just sit right down,I think.

26:19.996 --> 26:20.671
Yes,thank you.

26:20.685 --> 26:21.633
Right down to the buzzer.

26:21.645 --> 26:23.373
That was,like,a total "sports illustrated" moment.

26:23.386 --> 26:26.373
I actually think I got hit by kobe's sweat when he took the shot.

26:26.388 --> 26:27.552
Nice.

26:27.567 --> 26:28.993
You still down for hangin' out?

26:29.006 --> 26:30.041
Sure.

26:30.057 --> 26:32.253
Uh,do you-- you know a bar around here?

26:32.267 --> 26:33.740
Let's skip that whole bar thing.

26:33.757 --> 26:34.990
Too many drunken fans.

26:35.008 --> 26:35.632
Fine by me.

26:35.646 --> 26:36.693
At did you want to do?

26:37.658 --> 26:39.501
Let's get out of here,take a drive up mulholland.

26:41.005 --> 26:41.932
Mulholland?

26:41.948 --> 26:42.487
Yeah.

26:42.487 --> 26:43.422
My girlfriend's out of town.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.543
I don't have a curfew.

26:44.555 --> 26:45.601
hop in.

26:48.446 --> 26:50.032
It'll be fun,I promise.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.781
that-- that is a beautiful watch.

26:55.798 --> 26:57.580
I have three sons and a brother.

26:57.598 --> 26:59.313
I'm always looking for good gift ideas.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.221
Where did you buy it?

27:00.236 --> 27:01.340
Fred segal'S.

27:02.166 --> 27:07.340
I did their christmas display last year-- an homage to 1940s' noir.

27:07.358 --> 27:08.120
Hmm.

27:09.536 --> 27:17.702
Lawrence,I hate to be blunt-- maybe it's my age or my
 inability to be coy anymore in my life-- but are you gay?

27:17.718 --> 27:19.022
I mean,it's fine.

27:19.038 --> 27:23.300
I have a son who's gay,and I am a proud member of P.F.L.A.G.

27:24.938 --> 27:25.981
Are you...

27:25.995 --> 27:26.923
disappointed?

27:26.938 --> 27:27.621
No!

27:27.637 --> 27:29.163
I'm curious.

27:29.567 --> 27:30.280
Why...

27:31.418 --> 27:32.412
why date womomen?

27:32.426 --> 27:33.692
I love women.

27:34.356 --> 27:37.390
I love their companionship, their friendship.

27:37.408 --> 27:42.641
I just want someone to go to museums,parties,take dancing.

27:42.655 --> 27:44.133
Does that sound pathetic?

27:44.925 --> 27:45.670
No.

27:47.315 --> 27:49.190
No,it sounds very familiar.

27:50.076 --> 27:51.952
if you want to call it a night,I'd understand.

27:51.968 --> 27:54.040
No,lawrence,absolutely not.

27:54.057 --> 27:54.663
We haven't eaten.

27:54.677 --> 27:55.851
I'm starving to death.

27:55.868 --> 27:58.783
You want to share an order of edamame with me?

28:01.737 --> 28:02.692
what time did you tell the sitter?

28:02.708 --> 28:04.153
12:00,at the latest.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.180
Look,it's 10:30 now.

28:06.195 --> 28:07.570
This is ridiculous.

28:09.516 --> 28:10.008
oh,god.

28:10.008 --> 28:11.080
Is that vomit?

28:11.098 --> 28:14.110
Well,I don't want to get close enough to confirm or deny.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.370
Oh,god.

28:15.388 --> 28:17.442
This is the worst date night ever.

28:20.346 --> 28:21.453
that's betsy

28:21.465 --> 28:22.500
Hey,betsy.

28:22.518 --> 28:23.371
What's up?

28:25.506 --> 28:26.322
He is?

28:26.477 --> 28:28.120
Well,does he have a fever?

28:28.137 --> 28:29.143
He's throwing up.

28:29.155 --> 28:31.692
Okay,look,we'll,um,we'll be home soon.

28:31.705 --> 28:32.630
Thanks.

28:34.085 --> 28:35.871
Hey,we would've had to leave early anyway.

28:36.395 --> 28:39.213
You know,we should have just stayed home and watched a movie.

28:40.985 --> 28:44.733
Oh,honey,you know there's another pint of 
ice cream in the freezer,right?

28:44.747 --> 28:47.533
Can't I just make out with my husband?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.283
Yeah...

28:51.215 --> 28:52.432
if that's all.

28:54.136 --> 28:55.220
What's that supposed to mean?

28:55.875 --> 28:59.930
Just I was hoping that we could take the night off.

29:01.037 --> 29:03.110
Since when do you want to take the night off?

29:03.126 --> 29:06.823
It's just,you know,the way you've been...

29:08.268 --> 29:10.023
how exactly have I been?

29:11.115 --> 29:12.910
Just very...

29:13.836 --> 29:15.440
easily aroused.

29:16.017 --> 29:17.532
What,like some nympho?

29:18.515 --> 29:19.560
Like a hooker?

29:19.578 --> 29:21.512
I can't get enough,is that what you think?

29:21.955 --> 29:25.190
look,I'm not like some sexbot.

29:25.206 --> 29:29.502
You can't just put a battery in me,and boom,there I go.

29:29.515 --> 29:32.862
Even if I was 16,I-I couldn't keep up with you.

29:32.878 --> 29:39.001
Look,all I want is some sleep-- just eight hours 
of uninterrupted sleep.

29:39.538 --> 29:40.773
you want to take a break?

29:40.787 --> 29:45.433
You can sleep on the couch tonight and tomorrow!

29:46.628 --> 29:47.842
Oh,god.

29:50.735 --> 29:53.713
(Josh rouse's "jersey clowns" playing)

29:53.727 --> 29:55.351
I feel like I'm in high school again.

29:55.368 --> 29:58.613
Last time I was up here with some soccer player named Eli.

30:02.636 --> 30:04.142
is something bothering you?

30:05.975 --> 30:07.282
Am I that obvious?

30:07.708 --> 30:10.283
The one thing you're not is obvious,chad.

30:12.558 --> 30:14.963
I got the pages for tomorrow's shoot.

30:14.977 --> 30:16.213
I have three lines.

30:16.226 --> 30:17.213
Three.

30:18.026 --> 30:22.250
I was nominated for a daytime emmy,and now they're 
treating me like I was some day player or something.

30:22.267 --> 30:25.780
Okay,we've parked at inspiration point so you can 
bitch about your job?

30:26.615 --> 30:27.480
I thought we were friends.

30:27.498 --> 30:29.020
I don't know what we are,chad.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.080
You give me shoes,you...

30:31.097 --> 30:33.980
admire my body,and,uh,you know,I'm sorry,

30:33.995 --> 30:38.790
taking a drive up to a beautiful location is,regardless of 
categories,a date.

30:38.807 --> 30:40.801
I mean,come on,man,driving me all the way up here?

30:40.815 --> 30:44.230
Either you're gonna hack me into a million little pieces 
or you're gonna kiss me.

30:45.297 --> 30:48.822
Well,I'm not a serial killer,so...

30:51.468 --> 30:52.611
wait.

30:53.888 --> 30:55.113
So you are gay?

30:55.448 --> 30:56.410
No,man.

30:57.157 --> 30:58.931
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.

30:58.946 --> 30:59.630
Wait.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.220
What about your girlfriend?

31:03.148 --> 31:04.103
She doesn't mind.

31:05.198 --> 31:07.372
I've seen her make out with tons of girls.

31:09.876 --> 31:11.280
who am I to judge?

31:24.356 --> 31:28.991
he shows up for his interview,and I-I swear to you,
his face did not move.

31:29.008 --> 31:29.336
No!

31:29.336 --> 31:29.970
N-no,no.

31:29.985 --> 31:30.603
Not an inch.

31:31.196 --> 31:31.881
botox?

31:31.897 --> 31:34.810
Enough for all the ladies who do high tea at the bel-air.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.040
Yeah,I remember my first campaign.

31:37.058 --> 31:39.081
I didn't care about image.

31:39.095 --> 31:43.982
I would show up at a fund-raiser in the same suit that
 I wore to the previous night's fund-raiser,

31:43.997 --> 31:48.940
and sometimes my wife and i would even bring the kids,
strapped to us those backpacks.

31:48.956 --> 31:50.671
Sounds like fun.

31:50.685 --> 31:51.743
No,it was.

31:51.756 --> 31:57.700
And then we'd rush home,put the kids to bed and then stay 
up all night laughing about the kind of evening we had.

31:57.717 --> 32:00.203
Sounds like you and your wife made a really good team.

32:00.217 --> 32:01.130
Ex-wife.

32:01.147 --> 32:03.621
And yeah,we did,for a while.

32:06.617 --> 32:07.620
do you miss her?

32:08.536 --> 32:10.301
I miss the people we were back then.

32:12.465 --> 32:15.461
And,no,I don't miss who she is now.

32:16.525 --> 32:18.231
And I know she doesn't miss who I've become.

32:19.197 --> 32:21.342
Well,you're not all bad.

32:22.465 --> 32:24.961
At least you still have facial expressions.

32:24.976 --> 32:25.870
Yes.

32:28.576 --> 32:29.693
It's getting really late.

32:30.576 --> 32:31.903
We should probably go....

32:38.886 --> 32:40.323
oh,it's cold,too.

32:41.258 --> 32:42.943
Thanks for not holding tonight against me.

32:43.356 --> 32:46.353
Well,tomorrow you and I are gonna pretend that 
this night never happened.

32:49.256 --> 32:49.757
here they come.

32:49.757 --> 32:50.610
Here they come.

32:50.627 --> 32:53.331
Senator,are you dating kitty walker?

32:53.348 --> 32:54.951
How long have you two been seeing each other?

32:54.968 --> 32:55.407
right here.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.492
Big smile.

32:58.758 --> 33:00.573
cough medicine knocked cooper out.

33:00.585 --> 33:01.481
You give paige her shot?

33:01.496 --> 33:03.472
Yeah,she practically slept through it.

33:03.486 --> 33:04.362
Okay.

33:04.785 --> 33:07.723
Joe,we need to talk.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.800
Oh,don't worry.

33:09.817 --> 33:11.540
It's not even the original band.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.541
The lead singer's the only one left.

33:13.557 --> 33:15.951
Why didn't you tell me about vanessa?

33:16.595 --> 33:17.156
What?

33:17.156 --> 33:18.210
Vanessa.

33:18.656 --> 33:23.701
Oh,the other day,she said,"it's nice to finally meet you," 
but you never mentioned her to me.

33:23.716 --> 33:24.481
I didn't?

33:24.496 --> 33:25.211
No.

33:25.475 --> 33:27.923
Well,I didn't not mention her,if that's what you're implying.

33:27.935 --> 33:34.960
'Cause I felt kind of out of place,you know,walking in on 
you guys like that-- laughing, playing the guitar.

33:34.978 --> 33:37.223
We were passing time while the kids played.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.021
Is she married?

33:39.035 --> 33:42.810
She is divorced,and she is a friend,sarah.

33:42.827 --> 33:46.391
When did she go from being just a mom to being a friend?

33:46.405 --> 33:48.560
I didn't know I needed permission to make a new friend.

33:48.577 --> 33:51.163
No,you don't,joe,but I saw you.

33:51.178 --> 33:52.083
You were...

33:52.525 --> 33:53.513
connecting.

33:53.527 --> 33:56.521
And don't say that you weren't,because I felt it.

33:56.536 --> 33:57.383
Oh,come on.

33:57.398 --> 33:58.703
We were having fun,that's all.

33:58.716 --> 34:02.462
Well,I want us to have fun,and we don't,
not like we used to.

34:02.476 --> 34:03.773
Wait a minute.

34:04.555 --> 34:06.163
Was tonight about vanessa?

34:07.995 --> 34:08.753
Maybe.

34:11.306 --> 34:17.032
sarah,you have no idea what it's like being at home 
all the time,being around kids all day.

34:17.045 --> 34:20.942
Oh,I'm a mom,joe,and I have plenty of days 
where I'm with the kids.

34:20.958 --> 34:21.913
Yeah.

34:21.928 --> 34:23.293
You have your job.

34:23.306 --> 34:26.222
Being at home day after day...

34:28.456 --> 34:29.411
gets lonely.

34:29.965 --> 34:32.282
I thought things were getting better.

34:32.295 --> 34:33.422
They are.

34:33.556 --> 34:36.732
They why did I feel like the other woman when I walked in here?

34:37.687 --> 34:45.453
sarah,you're my wife,and there is no one else that I 
would rather be with.

34:48.257 --> 34:49.601
Oh,I'm sorry,babe.

34:50.676 --> 34:51.373
I just...

34:52.456 --> 34:54.543
I just miss us.

34:54.556 --> 34:55.440
Yeah.

34:56.705 --> 34:58.311
I miss us,too.

35:08.617 --> 35:09.852
Rise and shine,sleepyhead.

35:09.866 --> 35:11.011
Oh,mother.

35:12.287 --> 35:14.161
Mother,that annoyed me when I was 6.

35:14.175 --> 35:15.781
Can you imagine how it feels now?

35:15.797 --> 35:17.480
Just sit up and say "thank you."

35:18.795 --> 35:20.720
all right,all right.

35:21.865 --> 35:23.290
Thank you,mother.

35:23.876 --> 35:25.242
Did I forget my birthday?

35:25.256 --> 35:26.950
No,but I have gifts.

35:28.278 --> 35:29.763
Page 4b...

35:30.517 --> 35:36.423
page 12 of the "register," and I drove all the way
 to glendale for this one,page 8.

35:38.328 --> 35:40.192
I am having a nightmare,right?

35:40.208 --> 35:44.271
How could elise set you up with your boss 
without letting you know?

35:44.285 --> 35:46.660
Well,mccallister called her and arranged it.

35:46.678 --> 35:50.923
I mean,the only reason I did this stupid thing was so 
that people wouldn't think we were seeing each other,

35:50.938 --> 35:52.860
and--and now look at us!

35:52.877 --> 35:55.341
We're plastered all over the lifestyle section.

35:55.358 --> 35:57.403
Well,for what it's worth,at least he wasn't gay.

35:59.415 --> 36:00.221
What?

36:00.235 --> 36:07.930
lawrence was wonderful,really funny,easy to talk to--we're going shopping together next week-- but straight,he wasn'T.

36:09.536 --> 36:11.161
Kitty,I'm so confused.

36:12.126 --> 36:17.081
I went from my father's house to my husband's house
 with nothing in between.

36:17.766 --> 36:18.682
It's not like you.

36:19.106 --> 36:20.673
Your life was always yours.

36:20.807 --> 36:24.220
The choices you made,the life you created belong to you.

36:24.236 --> 36:25.691
Well,I...

36:26.188 --> 36:28.322
I thought that you always liked being home.

36:28.336 --> 36:28.962
I did.

36:28.977 --> 36:29.407
I did.

36:29.407 --> 36:31.943
I would not trade a single moment of it.

36:31.955 --> 36:37.602
But now your father's gone and all you kids are grown,
and I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.

36:42.135 --> 36:45.061
do you remember that time your father and I went 
to the spa in santa barbara?

36:45.497 --> 36:47.592
yes,how could I forget?

36:47.605 --> 36:50.280
He bitched about it for the next six months.

36:50.298 --> 36:57.130
They wanted us to fast because they said that was 
the quickest way to rid our bodies of all the toxins and begin anew.

36:57.556 --> 37:00.120
I think that's what I have to do with my life.

37:01.046 --> 37:07.892
I have to give myself some time to figure out who
 I am,without having anyone else to account to.

37:07.908 --> 37:10.200
How about we start with man-fasting?

37:11.528 --> 37:15.890
well,elise said mother/daughter teams are twice as much fun.

37:15.905 --> 37:17.463
To man-fasting.

37:17.476 --> 37:18.991
And more.

37:21.887 --> 37:23.561
It's not a bad picture.

37:23.577 --> 37:25.652
Her hair looks great.

37:25.666 --> 37:26.550
Yes,I know.

37:26.568 --> 37:28.132
Elise gave it volume.

37:28.147 --> 37:28.832
I like it.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.191
How much of a scandal is this?

37:30.208 --> 37:36.223
The scandal is right here,people--"chad barry has hot 
night with unknown but incredibly handsome attorney."

37:36.236 --> 37:39.810
Yeah,who's waging a valiant battle against 
his ever-encroaching gut.

37:40.418 --> 37:43.192
Nice try,but we all know you're pissed 'cause julia 
kicked you out of bed.

37:43.206 --> 37:44.741
I'm pissed you were at the game.

37:44.755 --> 37:48.820
Tommy,I suggest flowers and chocolate and jewelry.

37:48.836 --> 37:49.521
Listen to your mom.

37:49.536 --> 37:51.051
She's very wise.

37:51.067 --> 37:52.543
Sarah,how was your night with joe?

37:52.557 --> 37:57.143
Oh,the band never came on,cooper got sick,and I 
got vomit on my brand-new ankle boots.

37:57.158 --> 37:59.293
If you want me to babysit next weekend,I can.

37:59.306 --> 37:59.877
Thank you.

37:59.877 --> 38:00.541
okay.

38:00.555 --> 38:02.443
I still can't quite believe it.

38:02.456 --> 38:04.292
It was like sleeping with a greek god.

38:04.305 --> 38:05.223
Oh,my god.

38:05.236 --> 38:06.392
- The size of his...
 - whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

38:06.405 --> 38:07.301
Mother present.

38:07.315 --> 38:09.360
Are you gonna see this greek god again?

38:09.375 --> 38:10.350
Boot camp's in an hour.

38:10.367 --> 38:13.090
Yeah,if you have enough stamina left to work out.

38:13.105 --> 38:13.723
I do.

38:14.478 --> 38:15.502
Hi,sorry I'm late.

38:15.518 --> 38:16.112
hey.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.162
I brought muffins.

38:18.578 --> 38:20.120
Yeah,I-I could go a muffin.

38:20.136 --> 38:21.090
I'll take one for the road.

38:21.105 --> 38:21.780
I gotta get going.

38:21.797 --> 38:23.600
Uh,yeah,I really should get going,too.

38:23.615 --> 38:27.313
I promised saul that I would review holly's winery proposal.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.100
milk it for all it's worth.

38:32.548 --> 38:33.362
you know what?

38:33.376 --> 38:34.530
I hear the washing machine.

38:34.548 --> 38:35.413
It's beeping.

38:35.427 --> 38:36.702
I'll be right back.

38:40.638 --> 38:42.390
Did I forget deodorant or something?

38:43.827 --> 38:47.621
Um,honey,about last night...

38:47.635 --> 38:48.743
I'm sorry.

38:48.756 --> 38:52.090
You know I think you're the most beautiful,sexy woman in the world.

38:52.106 --> 38:54.251
I already know how you can make it up to me.

38:54.267 --> 38:55.653
Well,I'm ready,baby.

38:55.665 --> 38:57.472
Wherever,whatever,you name it.

38:57.485 --> 39:00.191
How's tonight in the living room?

39:01.178 --> 39:02.083
I'm there.

39:02.157 --> 39:07.902
Good,'cause I rented every single "die hard" movie,
and I got you some of that belgian beer you like.

39:09.008 --> 39:10.263
are you kidding me?

39:10.277 --> 39:11.813
"Die hard 3"?

39:11.826 --> 39:13.931
Yeah,well,I didn't know.

39:23.285 --> 39:24.030
hey.

39:24.048 --> 39:24.961
Oh,hey.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.450
Um,how are you-- how are you feeling today?

39:30.467 --> 39:31.561
Fine,man.

39:31.575 --> 39:32.570
You?

39:34.798 --> 39:35.783
Hey,mister.

39:35.798 --> 39:36.822
Baby.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.311
Hi.

39:38.328 --> 39:39.942
I thought you were gonna save me a spot.

39:39.957 --> 39:40.702
I am.

39:40.718 --> 39:41.891
This is,uh,kevin.

39:41.908 --> 39:43.222
You remember I told you about him,right?

39:43.235 --> 39:44.611
Oh,yeah,kevin,hi.

39:44.627 --> 39:45.921
You were there for the 3-pointer.

39:45.936 --> 39:46.532
Yeah.

39:46.545 --> 39:48.612
Michelle just got back into town this morning.

39:48.627 --> 39:50.293
H-how was,uh,how was new york?

39:50.308 --> 39:51.632
They loved her,man.

39:51.647 --> 39:52.972
She got rave reviews.

39:52.986 --> 39:54.070
Stop bragging.

39:54.088 --> 39:56.063
It was wonderful,thank you.

39:56.077 --> 39:57.233
Great.

39:57.248 --> 39:59.233
Mind if I take that spot?

39:59.246 --> 40:00.780
I haven't seen this guy for a while.

40:00.798 --> 40:01.922
Of course,no,no,sure.

40:01.935 --> 40:02.970
- Absolutely. - thank you.

40:04.626 --> 40:07.222
Hey,uh,later we should grab a smoothie or something.

40:07.236 --> 40:07.808
Sure.

40:07.808 --> 40:08.921
Yeah,great.

40:10.348 --> 40:11.873
Well,what the hell is he thinking?

40:13.095 --> 40:14.550
You tell the chairman that I'll be there.

40:15.615 --> 40:17.542
The committee on armed
services is meeting next week.

40:17.555 --> 40:21.540
Davids is introducing a joint resolution
calling for a freeze on military spending,

40:21.557 --> 40:24.173
including death benefits for families of military personnel.

40:25.108 --> 40:25.687
You saw it?

40:25.687 --> 40:26.371
I did.

40:26.387 --> 40:27.312
Page 4.

40:27.328 --> 40:28.921
We should've at least got page 2.

40:29.678 --> 40:30.692
Oh,I talked to everybody.

40:30.705 --> 40:31.963
I told them that we're not...

40:31.976 --> 40:33.263
no,no,I--yea I know.

40:33.277 --> 40:34.883
Noreen told me,thanks.

40:34.898 --> 40:39.770
I did get an earful this morning from my ex-wife--
 east coast time,which is always so nice.

40:39.786 --> 40:40.662
Did you...

40:40.675 --> 40:42.872
want her to see us togeth?

40:42.887 --> 40:43.405
Kitty.

40:43.405 --> 40:45.933
Well,it just--you're just not upset at all.

40:46.707 --> 40:47.572
I'm not.

40:48.765 --> 40:56.642
I wanted to have dinner with you,and if I'm honest,
then,yeah,I'm glad she saw me out with a beautiful woman.

40:58.028 --> 40:59.020
Does that make me petty?

40:59.038 --> 41:00.113
Yeah.

41:00.988 --> 41:03.553
But it also makes you human.

41:04.557 --> 41:06.373
Oh,and I think I know what davids is up to.

41:06.388 --> 41:09.901
I think he's trying to force you into defending a 
budget increase,and I think he's gonna spin it around,

41:09.917 --> 41:11.593
and he's gonna try to make you look hawkish.

41:11.605 --> 41:14.650
Us--make us look hawkish.

41:14.665 --> 41:15.801
You're on the team now.

41:16.397 --> 41:17.070
Come on.

41:17.325 --> 41:18.480
We're late for a staff meeting.

41:19.975 --> 41:20.572
RighT.

41:21.787 --> 41:22.472
Right.

41:22.676 --> 41:25.603
I think that we should compile a list of all the 
beneficiaries of the death benefit,

41:25.618 --> 41:28.690
and that way,when the committee sees the actual family members

41:28.707 --> 41:30.863
they'll have to think twice about the ramifications.

41:30.875 --> 41:33.660
And you should definitely speak to a-a veterans group.

41:33.678 --> 41:35.370
What about elaine berland at the "journal"?

41:35.386 --> 41:36.151
Yeah,call her.

41:36.165 --> 41:36.627
Call her.

41:36.627 --> 41:37.570
She'll sink her teeth into this.

41:37.586 --> 41:40.190
Also--and mary howard at "the post," and we should tip her,too.

41:40.205 --> 41:41.070
You are very good.

41:41.086 --> 41:42.802
Well,that's why you hired me.

41:42.818 --> 41:44.253
Excellent decision on my part.

41:44.267 --> 41:45.652
Well,I'm glad you think so.

41:45.665 --> 41:46.603
We'll go with that one.

41:46.618 --> 41:46.955
Thanks.

41:46.955 --> 41:47.550
All right.

41:48.266 --> 41:49.521
let's go,people.
