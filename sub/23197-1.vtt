11:07.166 --> 11:10.369
I'm running for class president.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.204
I'm only here to learn how I can

11:12.204 --> 11:13.238
help you and your fellow

11:13.239 --> 11:15.174
social gamers.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.308
Help?

11:16.308 --> 11:17.509
You just want an easy vote for

11:17.509 --> 11:19.445
a bucket of empty promises.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.413
If you fancy hard-core gamer

11:21.413 --> 11:22.414
folk really wanted to help us

11:22.414 --> 11:24.490
cow-clickers, you'd come to our

11:27.486 --> 11:29.521
Now, if you don't mind, i've got

11:29.521 --> 11:31.824
Bongo Berries to harvest.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.897
Two-minute warning,

11:37.897 --> 11:38.597
everybody.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.466
Two minutes to showtime.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.533
[bell rings]

11:41.533 --> 11:42.534
They're gonna ask a bunch of

11:42.534 --> 11:44.503
dumb, nosy, personal questions

11:44.503 --> 11:45.604
about my life, aren't they?

11:45.604 --> 11:47.406
Stop squirming.

11:47.406 --> 11:48.540
Gosh, I hate these things.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.974
I hate talking about myself.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.143
Well, get used to it, because

11:51.143 --> 11:52.444
being a pro means being

11:52.444 --> 11:53.444
a personality.

11:53.445 --> 11:55.547
Just look at ashley over there.

11:55.547 --> 11:56.448
...And then I says to the

11:56.448 --> 11:58.160
salesman, "yacht?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.120
[laughs]

12:01.120 --> 12:02.121
Oh, man.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.189
Jacques Latour, big fan.

12:04.189 --> 12:05.257
[gasps]

12:05.257 --> 12:07.126
That's Jacques Latour.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.160
Oh, my gosh, he's, like, the

12:08.160 --> 12:10.194
Best FPS coach of all time.

12:10.195 --> 12:11.597
I'm right here, Jenny.

12:11.597 --> 12:12.698
Mom, he coaches the Paris

12:12.698 --> 12:13.564
Panthers.

12:13.565 --> 12:14.566
That's, like, my favorite team

12:14.566 --> 12:16.100
since forever.

12:16.702 --> 12:17.569
I can't talk to him.

12:17.569 --> 12:18.469
Mom, will you go talk to him?

12:18.470 --> 12:19.672
Matthews, Barnstormer,

12:19.672 --> 12:21.140
30 seconds.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.308
Oh, god.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.175
Please tell me not to

12:23.175 --> 12:24.276
embarrass myself.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.343
Jenny, just relax.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.790
You're fine, okay?

12:28.113 --> 12:29.982
Okay.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.323
Jacques Latour...

12:37.323 --> 12:38.991
Cool dude.

12:38.991 --> 12:43.620
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

12:43.729 --> 12:45.130
[gasps]

12:45.130 --> 12:45.998
You're on.

12:45.998 --> 12:47.399
Go, go, go.

12:47.399 --> 12:50.269
[crowd cheering]

12:50.269 --> 12:53.706
W are back from commercials

12:53.706 --> 12:54.573
And talking to

12:54.573 --> 12:56.408
Ashley Barnstormer and

12:56.408 --> 12:57.977
Jenny Matrix.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.712
Please clap for them.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.450
[applause]

13:06.652 --> 13:08.654
Agree/Disagree?

13:08.654 --> 13:09.655
You know, TalkBot,

13:09.655 --> 13:12.358
I got to say, Jenny and VGHS

13:12.358 --> 13:13.592
have really pulled off something

13:13.592 --> 13:15.327
special this season.

13:15.327 --> 13:16.462
But I feel good about our

13:16.462 --> 13:17.329
chances.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.997
[applause]

13:18.998 --> 13:20.399
Jenny...

13:20.399 --> 13:21.767
Tell us about your parents'

13:21.767 --> 13:23.302
divorce.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.236
What?

13:24.236 --> 13:25.704
Do you blame yourself?

13:25.704 --> 13:27.372
Uh...

13:27.373 --> 13:28.240
No.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.408
Can we talk about something

13:29.408 --> 13:30.309
else?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.743
Who's the better smoocher,

13:31.744 --> 13:35.800
Brian D. or The Law?

13:36.548 --> 13:37.783
My goodness.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.618
Just playing, just playing!

13:39.618 --> 13:40.486
Ha ha ha ha.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.353
Very charming.

13:41.353 --> 13:43.222
Oh, my god.

13:55.401 --> 14:00.606
So, uh...

14:00.606 --> 14:03.750
How's drifting?

14:07.713 --> 14:09.480
How's not talking to Brian?

14:13.719 --> 14:15.421
[sighs]

14:15.421 --> 14:16.388
I'd at least like to know

14:16.388 --> 14:17.256
If Ki's all right.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.257
Haven't really talked to her

14:18.257 --> 14:19.123
since--

14:19.124 --> 14:20.726
Traveler, beware!

14:20.726 --> 14:23.529
Grave danger lies ahead.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.596
Oh, Ted, i think this is

14:24.596 --> 14:25.597
the guy.

14:25.597 --> 14:27.632
Are you the Babbages guy?

14:27.633 --> 14:29.568
You fools seek Babbage's

14:29.568 --> 14:30.636
Blade?

14:30.636 --> 14:31.569
[coughs]

14:31.570 --> 14:33.705
Yep, we do.

14:33.705 --> 14:34.673
Where do we go?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.742
Many have died in pursuit

14:36.742 --> 14:38.343
of that wretched blade.

14:38.343 --> 14:41.146
Before I send you to your doom,

14:41.146 --> 14:44.149
Prove you are worthy...

14:44.149 --> 14:45.417
By entering the exclusive

14:45.417 --> 14:46.819
pre-order bonus code found on

14:46.819 --> 14:48.420
The inside cover of the art book

14:48.420 --> 14:49.420
in the Deathstalker 2:

14:49.421 --> 14:51.423
King's Ransom edition...

14:51.423 --> 14:53.392
If you dare.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.359
Got it right here.

14:54.359 --> 14:58.230
It's 3-b-b-x-x-y-1.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.865
You are...

14:59.865 --> 15:00.866
Unworthy.

15:00.866 --> 15:01.834
Wait. what?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.301
No, no.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.369
Oh, wait a minute.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.270
It's not a one.

15:05.270 --> 15:06.771
It's a lowercase "l."

15:06.772 --> 15:10.242
You are worthy.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.709
Enjoy your thrilling

15:11.710 --> 15:13.345
DLC adventure.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.279
Thank you.

15:14.279 --> 15:15.647
But before you do,

15:15.647 --> 15:17.749
Hear this tragic tale

15:17.749 --> 15:19.384
of Sir Babbages

15:19.384 --> 15:20.719
And the cursed blade...

15:20.719 --> 15:21.620
Skip, skip, skip.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.488
I and knights --

15:22.488 --> 15:23.388
Skip, skip, skip, skip.

15:23.388 --> 15:24.389
Seeing nothing but death--

15:24.389 --> 15:26.125
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

15:26.125 --> 15:26.792
...ash under a sky of blood.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.659
Skip, skip, skip.

15:27.659 --> 15:28.660
Dude, we're on a clock here.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.695
I should have...

15:30.696 --> 15:32.164
I should have stayed a farmer.

15:32.164 --> 15:32.831
Just skip it.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.700
[groans]

15:39.605 --> 15:47.346
Okay, looks like it's, uh,

15:47.346 --> 15:50.682
yeah, this way.

15:50.682 --> 15:52.251
I didn't tell Ki not to talk

15:52.251 --> 15:55.587
to you or anything.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.422
Okay.

15:57.422 --> 15:58.924
She's just busy.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.159
You should hang out with her

16:00.159 --> 16:02.394
sometime.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.462
I will.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.396
Thanks.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.565
Anyway, let's get this

16:06.565 --> 16:08.434
over with.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.243
Traveler, beware!

16:23.949 --> 16:26.484
Hello?

16:29.354 --> 16:33.125
Is anybody down here?

16:54.379 --> 16:57.249
[dial-up connections whining]

16:57.849 --> 17:03.555
I didn't think you'd show up.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.623
Say hello to the Fruit Tune

17:04.623 --> 17:07.226
Farmers.

17:07.226 --> 17:11.930
Hi.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.598
A.cC's broken,

17:13.598 --> 17:15.500
Runny noses wherever you look,

17:15.500 --> 17:16.935
Spotty wi-fi.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.270
We lost our Fiddle Fig crop

17:18.270 --> 17:20.439
when the router timed out.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.540
We'd suffer it all if we could

17:21.540 --> 17:23.608
get some decent computers.

17:34.319 --> 17:40.591
Well, I can see why you would

17:40.592 --> 17:43.729
need wi-fi and actual chairs,

17:43.729 --> 17:44.997
But the computers seem to be

17:44.997 --> 17:46.832
running the game just fine.

17:46.832 --> 17:47.799
All we want is equal

17:47.799 --> 17:48.966
treatment.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.769
These computers are lame.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.471
The ones they got upstairs--

17:52.471 --> 17:53.872
they're, like, from the future.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.274
Well, that's because they're

17:55.274 --> 17:57.842
for playing real games.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.120
"Real games"?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.382
Fruit Tune Farms may not have

18:03.382 --> 18:04.716
fancy graphics or take

18:04.716 --> 18:06.685
lightning-fast reflexes,

18:06.685 --> 18:08.419
But it takes dedication and care

18:08.420 --> 18:09.855
to tend these crops.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.456
We love it, and it brings us

18:11.456 --> 18:16.962
together.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.665
So i ask you, Ki swan, isn't

18:19.665 --> 18:21.600
that what gaming's all about?

18:39.685 --> 18:42.254
[shrieking]

20:10.975 --> 20:16.848
[dragon screeches]

20:16.848 --> 20:19.717
[groaning]

20:30.929 --> 20:34.699
She has to get--

20:34.699 --> 20:35.967
Ah, Ki!

20:35.967 --> 20:36.902
Where have you been?

20:36.902 --> 20:37.769
The debate's in, like,

20:37.769 --> 20:38.637
five seconds!

20:38.637 --> 20:39.504
I was talking with the

20:39.504 --> 20:40.171
Social gamers--

20:40.172 --> 20:41.390
Dah -- Blagh!

20:41.907 --> 20:42.774
Look, bad news--

20:42.774 --> 20:43.809
Shane-- Shane promised pizza

20:43.809 --> 20:45.476
Parties to every team in the school.

20:45.477 --> 20:46.445
So we have to shift to a

20:46.445 --> 20:47.745
pro-pizza party platform.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.613
You got that?

20:48.613 --> 20:49.514
When they ask about the

20:49.514 --> 20:50.181
student funds--

20:50.182 --> 20:51.650
Wendell, there's good things

20:51.650 --> 20:52.784
we can do with that money.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.786
Aw, Ki, look at that crowd.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.210
They are literally eating up

20:59.959 --> 21:05.197
Candidates, tick tock.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.598
Let's get this show on the road.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.000
Guh.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.137
[exhales deeply]

21:12.137 --> 21:14.940
And every night i would open

21:14.940 --> 21:18.900
ip that freezer door and say,

21:20.245 --> 21:22.746
My strawberry swirl."

21:22.747 --> 21:23.915
Thank you.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.484
Jenny...

21:25.484 --> 21:28.530
Same question.

21:29.688 --> 21:30.889
a strawberry milkshake,

21:30.889 --> 21:33.580
would you still love him?

21:34.826 --> 21:38.697
No, because he'd be a milkshake.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.931
[crowd grumbling]

21:40.932 --> 21:42.234
So physical attraction

21:42.234 --> 21:43.869
is important to you.

21:43.869 --> 21:44.735
[crowd booing]

21:44.736 --> 21:45.604
What?

21:45.604 --> 21:46.972
No, i'm just being realistic.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.839
Come on.

21:47.839 --> 21:48.773
Looks like the only thing

21:48.773 --> 21:49.841
colder than that milkshake

21:49.841 --> 21:51.800
is jenny's heart.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.947
For Ashley!

21:55.947 --> 21:56.982
Next segment--

21:56.982 --> 21:59.840
"Did Jenny just say that?"

21:59.985 --> 22:01.620
Jenny, rank your favorite

22:01.620 --> 22:03.655
races in order.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.856
Um, wha--

22:04.856 --> 22:06.124
It's just a thought

22:06.124 --> 22:07.259
experiment, jenny.

22:07.259 --> 22:10.195
No one will get mad at you.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.530
Okay.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.898
Um...

22:12.898 --> 22:16.534
Well, i guess that i'm white,

22:16.535 --> 22:17.836
So...white.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.871
And then i love indian food,

22:19.871 --> 22:21.873
so maybe that would be two?

22:21.873 --> 22:23.241
We were talking about

22:23.241 --> 22:25.744
World of Warcraft.

22:25.744 --> 22:26.878
Oh, my God.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.947
[crowd booing]

22:28.947 --> 22:30.581
And that is how my drinking

22:30.582 --> 22:32.117
fountain redistribution act will

22:32.117 --> 22:33.818
ensure equal access to all

22:33.818 --> 22:35.820
students without increasing

22:35.820 --> 22:37.880
hallway foot traffic.

22:39.958 --> 22:44.162
Okay, final question--

22:44.162 --> 22:45.630
How do you plan to use the

22:45.630 --> 22:48.733
student fund to benefit vghs?

22:48.733 --> 22:50.869
Shane, two minutes.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.271
I only need two words--
