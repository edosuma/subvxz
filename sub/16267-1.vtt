<i>Woman: But you took a huge
bet on the housing crisis</i>

00:57.890 --> 01:01.126
<i>in the middle of
the biggest boom in housing</i>

01:01.127 --> 01:03.394
<i>anybody has ever seen. Why?</i>

01:03.395 --> 01:04.930
<i>Man: I'm a child of the '50s.</i>

01:04.931 --> 01:08.766
<i>My father welded steel for the Navy
and my mother worked at the V.A.</i>

01:08.767 --> 01:11.568
<i>They lived through the Depression,
Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb.</i>

01:11.569 --> 01:13.772
<i>They didn't think that
bad things might happen.</i>

01:13.773 --> 01:16.374
<i>They knew that bad
things would happen.</i>

01:16.375 --> 01:18.744
<i>- Woman: Is that what's happening now?
- When I was a kid,</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:20.745
<i>my favorite teacher
was Mr. James.</i>

01:20.746 --> 01:23.648
<i>Mr. James said, "World events
all revolve around five things.</i>

01:23.649 --> 01:25.917
M-O-N-E-Y."

01:25.918 --> 01:28.887
( laughs )
This is freshman econ?

01:28.888 --> 01:32.524
It was fifth grade econ, but this is
something we've seen over and over again.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.893
Time and time again,
the competition

01:34.894 --> 01:38.263
for this limited amount
of dollars out there

01:38.264 --> 01:40.532
can make the best of us manic.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.333
So it's not surprising that
we have these asset bubbles,

01:43.334 --> 01:45.770
but when reality sets in,
of course they burst.

01:45.771 --> 01:47.675
<i>( music playing )</i>

02:29.448 --> 02:31.515
<i>- the historic run-up in price.
- Man: Here you go.</i>

02:31.516 --> 02:33.786
<i>Take a look at the dramatic move
in copper prices, for example,</i>

02:33.787 --> 02:37.922
<i>as that once-quiet market has
become a hotbed of activity.</i>

02:37.923 --> 02:39.327
<i>Man: You're disappointed.</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:44.696
Quants?

02:44.697 --> 02:47.398
Derivative structures?
I mean, what was that about?

02:47.399 --> 02:49.701
It makes no sense.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.806
That's what you said last time.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.573
Why'd we go down there?

02:55.574 --> 02:58.275
<i>- To sign.
- To sign.</i>

02:58.276 --> 02:59.844
<i>- Did we sign?
- No.</i>

02:59.845 --> 03:01.014
No. We did not.

03:02.014 --> 03:05.316
Instead, I flew 2,000 miles
for a marketing meeting.

03:05.317 --> 03:07.385
( sighs )

03:07.386 --> 03:09.419
Where was Mayfield?

03:09.420 --> 03:12.757
What was this emergency?
What was that about?

03:12.758 --> 03:14.559
You speak to the auditors?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.627
Why?

03:16.628 --> 03:20.544
<i>What if we don't sign
this week?</i>

03:32.544 --> 03:34.414
See you. Bye.

04:09.414 --> 04:11.887

04:21.560 --> 04:22.697
Look who's here.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.929
What a minute.

04:25.930 --> 04:28.833
<i>How'd you know
I had something there?</i>

04:28.834 --> 04:31.802
<i>- Woman: No fighting, no fighting.
- Easy, easy, easy.</i>

04:31.803 --> 04:34.672
- We had to start. The kids were starving.
- No, no. That's okay.

04:34.673 --> 04:38.975
Dad, it's your birthday.
You are spoiling them rotten--

04:38.976 --> 04:42.946
- It's my job. God. You guys turned out fine.
- Debatable.

04:42.947 --> 04:44.817
- How are you doing, son?
- How'd it go?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.987
Where's my drink?
This is mine? Here?

04:48.987 --> 04:52.959
- All: Happy birthday!
- ( party horns blaring )

04:54.959 --> 04:56.096
Oh-oh, wow.

04:58.096 --> 05:00.597
Hey, kids. Come on,
come on. I need some help.

05:00.598 --> 05:02.734
I can't do these by myself.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.737
First of all, you have to make a wish.
Make a really good wish.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.671
I need you to help me out.
Wish and then we go on three.

05:07.672 --> 05:08.841
<i>- Got a wish?
- Woman: What are you going to wish for?</i>

05:08.842 --> 05:11.377
1... 2... 3.

05:12.377 --> 05:14.845
- Awesome.
- ( cheering )

05:14.846 --> 05:16.881
<i>- Excellent.
- Man: Speech.</i>

05:16.882 --> 05:19.650
<i>- That was really-- thank you, thank you.
- ( clinking on glass )</i>

05:19.651 --> 05:21.652
Thank you all very much.
It's such a surprise.

05:21.653 --> 05:24.422
I didn't even know
it was my birthday.

05:24.423 --> 05:26.457
What did Mark Twain
say about-- he said,

05:26.458 --> 05:30.061
"Old age is clearly
a case of mind over matter.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.896
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter."

05:31.897 --> 05:34.799
- ( laughter )
- I've done a lot of things in my life.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.402
I've worked very hard,
but being here,

05:37.403 --> 05:39.737
looking around...

05:39.738 --> 05:43.508
at all these shining,
radiant faces,

05:43.509 --> 05:45.676
<i>I know that my best work
is right here</i>

05:45.677 --> 05:47.677
<i>in this room, right now.</i>

05:47.678 --> 05:49.982
I'm deeply proud of all of
you, and that's the best gift

05:49.983 --> 05:52.616
your mom and I could ever hope for.
So thank you.

05:52.617 --> 05:54.683
And to have sold the company
to Standard this morning.

05:54.684 --> 05:56.721
- Hey, hey, hey. Yes, that's true,
- All right, not now.

05:56.722 --> 05:58.823
but no business tonight.
No business.

05:58.824 --> 06:02.559
Although your
one-pointed mind assures me

06:02.560 --> 06:05.696
that you have not only your
mom's genes, you got mine, too.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.664
I know it's very
uncharacteristic of me,

06:07.665 --> 06:10.134
but I just want you to know that
it's probably taken me 60 years

06:10.135 --> 06:13.604
for me to really understand
what's truly important,

06:13.605 --> 06:16.707
and that's you guys.
So I love you all very much.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.076
<i>- Woman: Aww.
- Man: Hear, hear.</i>

06:18.077 --> 06:20.579
<i>- Love you.
- ( applause )</i>

06:21.579 --> 06:22.879
I'll take a big piece.

06:24.081 --> 06:26.450
You can wait. You can wait
a little while longer.

06:26.451 --> 06:28.654
<i>- Woman: I don't know about me as a mom.
- No, no, no. You should have.</i>

06:28.655 --> 06:32.088
I want more kids, everywhere.
I want more "yous" around.

06:32.089 --> 06:35.460
It's all about you, is it?

06:35.461 --> 06:37.565
- Four and 19.
- All right.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yah.

06:42.233 --> 06:45.035
- So what was that all about?
- What?

06:45.036 --> 06:46.769
The last time you gave
a speech like that,

06:46.770 --> 06:48.240
we lost the bid to Firestone.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.842
( chuckles )
Yeah, well, I don't know.

06:51.843 --> 06:54.182
I just wanted it to be
about the family tonight.

06:57.182 --> 06:59.987
- Did you see this?
- ( scoffs ) Yeah.

07:01.987 --> 07:04.789
You know how I feel
about that. Trash can.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.125
Peter has a copy pinned up
in the conference room.

07:07.126 --> 07:11.061
Well, are you going to keep
skirtin' around it?

07:11.062 --> 07:12.864
Why sell our company?

07:12.865 --> 07:16.600
- We make a great return.
- ( sighs )

07:16.601 --> 07:18.703
We give money to the
causes we believe in,

07:18.704 --> 07:21.239
that we know are important.
We love what we do.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.542
My darling, you are still
in your 20s. I'm 60.

07:24.543 --> 07:28.112
That is a huge difference
of point of view.

07:28.113 --> 07:29.914
- Dad.
- Yes?

07:29.915 --> 07:32.616
You are not old.

07:32.617 --> 07:35.919
- Last year was our best year--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It catches up, all right?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.989
Maybe there's some other
things I'd like to do.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.791
Maybe I would like to spend
a little more time

07:39.792 --> 07:41.659
with you guys

07:41.660 --> 07:43.831
outside the office.

07:45.831 --> 07:48.131
- What?
- I'm just trying to imagine

07:48.132 --> 07:49.742
what we would do.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.975
Where are you going?

07:58.976 --> 08:01.145
<i>- The office.
- Now?</i>

08:01.146 --> 08:03.814
Yeah, I've got to finish up
that thing.

08:03.815 --> 08:05.785
Aww, but...

08:06.785 --> 08:11.222
I haven't given you
your birthday present yet.

08:11.223 --> 08:13.114
Then I'll come back
as soon as I can.

08:36.114 --> 08:37.715
Just keep it.

08:37.716 --> 08:40.083
Yeah, Gavin. It's me.
When you get this...

08:40.085 --> 08:41.019
could you call
Chris Vogler at Fremaut?

08:42.019 --> 08:44.519
Tell him that I need to talk
to him right away. Thanks.

You know that. I'm sorry.</i>

09:24.631 --> 09:26.738
<i>And I'm always saying
I'm sorry, but...</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:35.379
it doesn't mean I wouldn't
rather be here with you.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.416
The show's gonna be beautiful.

<i>- I'm working on it.
- Well, while you're doing that,</i>

11:37.996 --> 11:40.397
- let me tell you what's not working.
- Okay.

11:40.398 --> 11:42.966
What's not working
is my $412 million

11:42.967 --> 11:45.769
that's sitting in your account
so you can pass your audit.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.204
The $412 million

11:47.205 --> 11:49.907
you needed, you said,
for two weeks.

11:49.908 --> 11:52.442

languishing now for 32 days</i>

11:52.443 --> 11:55.412
<i>while it could be elsewhere
invested, earning an actual return</i>

11:55.413 --> 11:58.415
instead of couching this absurd
lie that you're spinning.

11:58.416 --> 12:02.153
- What do you want me to say?
- That you're going to get a signature from Mayfield

12:02.154 --> 12:05.090
and that my hostage money and my fee
are going to be sent to me promptly,

12:05.091 --> 12:07.296

12:11.296 --> 12:13.032

12:14.032 --> 12:16.432
I'm going to get your money
and your fee.

12:16.433 --> 12:19.436
- You will have it very shortly.
- When?

12:19.437 --> 12:23.541
As soon as they sign
the fucking contract.

12:23.542 --> 12:26.576
You know, I'm not the one
with the liability.

12:26.577 --> 12:28.144

- for fraudulent conveyance--
- Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that, Jeff.

12:33.451 --> 12:34.984
I didn't get you
into this mess.

12:34.985 --> 12:37.387
- Remember when you asked me if it was a good idea...
- Would a friend--

12:37.388 --> 12:39.057
- You were a friend of mine--
- ...to convert half your liquid assets

12:39.058 --> 12:42.160
into a fucking copper mine?
What did I tell you?

12:43.160 --> 12:46.397
Are we done?
I think we're done here.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.000

I take my money back.

Jeffrey!

14:55.227 --> 14:56.994
- Yeah.
- Right?

14:56.995 --> 14:59.129
So I want to have some fun.

14:59.130 --> 15:02.733
I want to have fun with you. Let's
go to Rovella. The house there.

15:02.734 --> 15:06.369
- We haven't been there forever.
- I just haven't had time.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.306
We have to make time.
We could take a year.

15:08.307 --> 15:11.274
Let's take a year
and get fat and have fun

15:11.275 --> 15:13.210
and go on an adventure.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.745
I mean, seriously,
how much money do we need?

15:15.746 --> 15:18.046
Do you want to be the richest
guy in the cemetery?

15:18.047 --> 15:20.351
- I don't want to be in the cemetery.
- Oh, by the way,

15:20.352 --> 15:22.418
Mary called from
St. Victor's Hospital again.

15:22.419 --> 15:23.755
- She hasn't gotten the check.
- Yeah, I'm taking care of that.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.024
The gala is Friday.
Should I be selling my ring?

15:27.024 --> 15:30.661
- What's going on?
- I've had to move a lot of things around for this merger.

15:30.662 --> 15:32.427
It hasn't been easy.
It's very complicated.

15:32.428 --> 15:34.399
- It's only two million.
- Only two million?

15:34.400 --> 15:37.267
- Yeah.
- You remember Riccio's?

15:37.268 --> 15:40.738
- Yeah.
- Four meals, two bucks.

15:40.739 --> 15:44.207
All you can eat, three bucks.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.210
I do remember,

15:47.211 --> 15:49.612
but I do not remember
you being this sentimental,

15:49.613 --> 15:51.010
unless you're trying
to change the subject.

15:51.015 --> 15:52.317
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.667
<i>- ( knocks on door )
- Yup.</i>

16:09.667 --> 16:11.368
Hello, how are you?

16:11.369 --> 16:13.138
- Good evening, Mr. Miller. Nice to see you.
- Julian.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.705
Your table has been waiting

16:14.706 --> 16:17.508
and your guests are here.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.779
Excellent.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.549
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.752
- Where the hell is Mayfield?
- I don't know.

16:28.753 --> 16:31.721
- Mr. Miller. Thank you so much for coming.
- Hello. No, no, no, no.

16:31.722 --> 16:32.990
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.658
We were just getting acquainted
with Peter and Brooke here.

16:35.659 --> 16:39.095
- I hope they didn't beat you up too much.
- No, no. They've been terrific.

16:39.096 --> 16:41.330
Dad, we've been talking
about operations.

16:41.331 --> 16:43.534
<i>- Tim thinks once we consolidate,
- ( cell phone vibrating )</i>

16:43.535 --> 16:47.171
<i>we can save about...
50% on our back office costs.</i>

16:47.172 --> 16:49.739
Yeah, I'd like to hear
more about that,

16:49.740 --> 16:53.310
but, eh, I had thought
that Mr. Mayfield

16:53.311 --> 16:55.079
planned to meet us
here tonight.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.380
Yeah, Jim should be here
in about 20 minutes.

16:57.381 --> 17:00.216
He suggested that we
get right into details.

17:00.217 --> 17:01.719
I was just saying to Brooke,
now that we can market

17:01.720 --> 17:03.754
<i>your quants track records,</i>

17:03.755 --> 17:06.089
<i>we have access
to a host of new capital.</i>

17:06.089 --> 17:10.160
And we've got something very special,
something we're thrilled about.

17:10.161 --> 17:13.229
New capital is exciting.
( laughs )

17:13.230 --> 17:15.598
<i>- That's why we're here.
- Brooke: Talk to us a bit about oversight.</i>

17:15.599 --> 17:19.569
<i>I mean, obviously we've been very
successful at what we do because...</i>

17:19.569 --> 17:22.472
We hope that it spreads
across-- oh, thank you.

17:22.473 --> 17:25.508
Assuming we shed debt through
some small liquidations,

17:25.509 --> 17:28.511
we're looking at a
significant uptake in ROI.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.713
<i>I don't want to pin
a number on it,</i>

17:30.714 --> 17:33.249
<i>but they-- significant in
the first quarter alone.</i>

17:33.250 --> 17:35.384
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We've been here

17:35.385 --> 17:37.754
almost two hours now.
Where is Mr. Mayfield?

17:37.755 --> 17:39.890
He just texted me.

17:39.891 --> 17:43.126
He's very sorry,
but he's been detained.

17:43.127 --> 17:46.400
Detained? Where?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.767
All right. I think I can
trust you with my family.

17:51.768 --> 17:53.371
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course. Mr. Miller, again, it was a privilege.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.806
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Dad, Dad? Excuse me.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.242
This is the bullshit way
you try to close a deal?

17:58.243 --> 18:01.278
Port. Would you like
some-- to have some port?

18:01.279 --> 18:03.248
- Dad. Did you get my message?
- Yeah?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.382
- No, what's up?
- We need to sit down.

18:05.383 --> 18:06.883
( sighs ) What is it?

18:06.884 --> 18:09.886
- I can't talk about it here.
- Brooke, I--

18:09.887 --> 18:14.391
I found some strange entries
in the Old Hill books.

18:14.392 --> 18:16.527
- What kind of entries?
- I don't know yet,

18:16.528 --> 18:18.495
but something
is definitely off.

18:18.496 --> 18:20.497
All right, all right.

18:20.498 --> 18:24.168
Come by around 11:00 tomorrow.
We'll look at it then. Okay?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.768
And, Brooke?

18:25.769 --> 18:28.309
See if you can find out what
happened with Mayfield. All right?

18:32.309 --> 18:34.319
<i>- ( laughing )
- ( music playing )</i>

18:42.319 --> 18:43.757
Excuse me. Thanks.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.361
( chatter )

18:50.361 --> 18:52.362
- Good evening, Mr. Miller.
- Hey.

18:52.363 --> 18:54.964
- So how are they doing?
- Great. Everyone loves them.

18:54.965 --> 18:58.438
- How are they doing?
- So-so.

19:00.438 --> 19:02.272
- Where's Julie?
- She's in the back.

19:02.273 --> 19:04.777
Thanks.

19:39.777 --> 19:41.545
So...

19:41.546 --> 19:43.981
I've seen you've met already.
It's Victor Rodriguez.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.883
<i>- Isn't it amazing?
- Woman: He's extraordinary.</i>

19:46.884 --> 19:48.919
- Great show.
- Oh, this is Robert Miller.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.188
One of our collectors.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.656
- This is Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava.
- Alex.

19:53.657 --> 19:56.727
- She's a talented young artist.
- Really? Painter?

19:56.728 --> 19:58.029
- Drawing.
- Drawing? That's great.

19:59.029 --> 20:01.931
So, eh, I like the size
of the paintings.

20:01.932 --> 20:03.005
I want to talk to you
about them in a second.

20:07.005 --> 20:10.885
- Why are you doing this?
- Go away.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.854
Emma, let me see the list.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.891
- I will take these two.
- Okay.

20:27.892 --> 20:31.295
- What's the Rubik's Cube in the back there?
- Right there. Number seven.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.797
All right. Great.
Don't tell her it was me.

20:33.798 --> 20:35.298
- No problem.
- I mean it.

20:35.299 --> 20:36.693
You got it.

21:02.693 --> 21:04.641
<i>( music playing )</i>

21:16.641 --> 21:18.945
<i>( cell phone beeping )</i>

21:21.945 --> 21:23.818
Excuse me.

21:27.818 --> 21:30.787
<i>- Who is this?
- Robert: It's me.</i>

21:30.788 --> 21:33.957
<i>- What do you want?
- I'm here.</i>

21:33.958 --> 21:36.492
- Where?
- I'm in your bedroom.

21:36.493 --> 21:38.829
Came in the back. Can you get
those people out of here?

21:38.830 --> 21:42.800
- Are you serious?
- Look at your bedroom door. Do you see me?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.846
<i>- Yeah, I see you.
- I'm serious.</i>

21:54.846 --> 21:56.846
Excuse me, guys.

21:56.847 --> 22:00.888
<i>I'm sorry. I know, I know.</i>

22:04.888 --> 22:06.890
You just come in and out
whenever you want?

22:06.891 --> 22:10.093
I thought we should talk.

22:10.094 --> 22:13.430
One damn night in a month.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.898
- I told you it was important to me.
- I was working.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.501
- You understand that?
- ( speaks French )

22:17.502 --> 22:19.469
I have obligations.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.069
- I don't want to hear--
- I'm under a lot of pressure right now.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.904
- I don't want to hear about your obligations!
- I could use a little help.

22:22.905 --> 22:24.709
If you cared,
you would have been there.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.576
I was there. I was there!

22:26.577 --> 22:29.578
I was late, but I was there.
And I'm here now.

22:29.579 --> 22:32.149
No, no, no. You're here when it's
convenient for you to be here.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.491
( speaks French )
Love means you fucking show up.

22:41.491 --> 22:42.496
<i>Sorry.</i>

22:45.496 --> 22:49.900
- Why did you buy those paintings?
- Because I liked them.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.936
( scoffs )

22:52.936 --> 22:55.838
<i>Okay. Thank you
for helping me to get started,</i>

22:55.839 --> 22:59.742
but if I'm going to fail,
then let me fail.

22:59.743 --> 23:02.212
<i>Julie, you won't fail.
Why would you fail?</i>

23:02.213 --> 23:04.914
You know,

23:04.915 --> 23:07.050
I'm not the kind of guy
that wants to throw money away.

23:07.051 --> 23:11.188
You want to start a business, you
have to project a certain image.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.027
<i>- What image?
- Success.</i>

23:16.027 --> 23:17.795
The market is a disaster
right now.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.729
<i>For everybody.
No one's moving anything.</i>

23:20.730 --> 23:23.834
<i>So that's why
you've got to show sales.</i>

23:23.835 --> 23:26.068
People look at you then
and they say,

23:26.069 --> 23:27.970
"Wow, how did she do that?"

23:27.971 --> 23:30.548
<i>That's what they remember.
Always.</i>

23:37.548 --> 23:39.054
You're never
going to leave her.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.968
( erratic breathing )

23:56.968 --> 23:59.837
Come away with me.

24:00.837 --> 24:03.977
Let's take your car and go.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.779
Where?

24:09.779 --> 24:12.582
It's a place I'm staying.

24:12.583 --> 24:16.118
Beautiful, on the water.

24:16.119 --> 24:19.625
We could wake up there,
together, just you and me.

24:21.625 --> 24:25.604
- I'd like that.
- Me, too.

24:33.604 --> 24:37.744
<i># Just one more chance #</i>

24:40.744 --> 24:46.153
<i># To prove it's you alone
I care for #</i>

24:49.153 --> 24:53.595
<i># Each night I say
a little prayer for #</i>

24:57.595 --> 25:01.936
<i># Just one more chance #</i>

25:05.936 --> 25:09.849
<i># Just one more night. #</i>

25:19.849 --> 25:21.623
<i>( screams )</i>

25:25.623 --> 25:27.865
Ahh!

25:34.865 --> 25:36.008
( groans )

25:44.008 --> 25:46.875
Jul-- Julie?

25:46.876 --> 25:49.971
Julie?

26:13.971 --> 26:15.980
God!

26:23.980 --> 26:24.823
( grunting )

26:32.823 --> 26:34.300
Fuck!

26:44.300 --> 26:45.287
Fuck!

27:03.287 --> 27:05.343
( yells )

27:59.343 --> 28:01.419
Ow!

28:08.419 --> 28:12.022
- Yes, I want to make it collect.
- Your name, sir?

28:13.022 --> 28:16.500
- Lawrence Grant.
- ( phone ringing )

28:22.500 --> 28:24.769
<i>Man: Who the fuck is this?</i>

28:25.769 --> 28:28.438
Jimmy, it's me.

28:28.439 --> 28:31.775
<i>Robert?</i>

28:31.776 --> 28:34.913
I want you to listen to me
very, very closely.

28:36.913 --> 28:38.516
<i>Dispatch: Vehicle is
1978, brown Mercedes,</i>

28:38.517 --> 28:40.916
<i>- registered to a Julie Cote.
- Douche.</i>

28:40.917 --> 28:44.386
<i>5-1-1-20 40th street.
Subject is a French national.</i>

28:44.387 --> 28:46.789
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

28:46.790 --> 28:49.526
Catching Detective wants us
to rule before he calls it.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.194
We've been having the same
fucking argument for 20 years.

28:52.195 --> 28:54.365
He can't handle one drunk
motorist who kills herself?

28:54.366 --> 28:57.066
You know what? I'm not
so sure about this.

28:57.067 --> 28:59.835
If the car rolled
on multiple impacts,

28:59.836 --> 29:03.910
but she was here
and her feet were down here.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.018
So who kicked out the door?

29:14.018 --> 29:15.997
( groans ) Let's go.

29:26.997 --> 29:29.035
You want to tell me
what this is?

29:31.035 --> 29:32.935
Better you don't ask.

29:32.936 --> 29:35.971
So all you're saying is you
need a ride somewhere.

29:35.972 --> 29:38.608
- That's correct.
- Because I'm going to be very clear about this. All right?

29:38.609 --> 29:41.911
You called me up for a ride.
I showed up, I gave you a ride.

29:41.912 --> 29:44.314
No, you didn't. We're not here.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.018
Then where the fuck are we?

29:48.018 --> 29:52.255
We're both asleep
right now, at home.

29:52.256 --> 29:55.124
- Which is where you left your phone, right?
- Right.

29:55.125 --> 29:58.327
- Yeah, 'cause if anyone checks...
- Why is anybody going to check?

29:58.328 --> 30:01.932
Well, they're not.
As long as we're not here.

30:02.932 --> 30:05.634
- Anybody know you're here?
- No.

30:05.635 --> 30:09.174
- Somebody knows you're here?
- No.

30:11.174 --> 30:15.143
- Somebody knows you're not there?
- My girl, but--

30:15.144 --> 30:18.047
- Ah, Jimmy! Jesus Christ!
- You call me up at 2:00 a.m.!

30:18.048 --> 30:19.316
- What the fuck you want?
- I fucking told you!

30:19.317 --> 30:22.588
She asked me where I was going.
All right?

30:25.588 --> 30:27.624
All right, what did you say?

30:27.625 --> 30:29.328
I told her
I had to run out a minute.

30:32.328 --> 30:35.530
- You trust her?
- Is this the kind of shit you used to do to my dad?

30:35.531 --> 30:38.034
- Do you trust her?
- Yes, I fucking trust her!

30:38.035 --> 30:40.203
- I fucking trust her.
- All right, all right. Good.

30:40.204 --> 30:43.439
- Good. You're at home and I'm at home.
- Jesus.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.142
My wife gets up
at 5:00 a.m. for Pilates.

30:46.143 --> 30:48.644
I'll be there next to her. That's
where I've been all night long.

30:48.645 --> 30:50.914
- You do the same with yours.
- I don't know, man.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.950
- This is some pretty fucked-up shit. Seriously.
- Jimmy, just fucking do it.

30:53.951 --> 30:55.417
- Don't think about it--
- No, fuck that, man!

30:55.418 --> 30:57.219
I don't hear from you
since the fucking funeral,

30:57.220 --> 30:59.621
you call me up out of the
blue, using my father's name?

30:59.622 --> 31:02.092
What is it? Do you want money?
Is that what you want?

31:02.093 --> 31:03.593
I'll give you money, all right?

31:03.594 --> 31:06.595
I will give you $5,000--
I will give you $10,000--

31:06.596 --> 31:09.065
$20,000. I'll give you
whatever you fucking--

31:09.066 --> 31:11.001
You want to talk to me like this?!
You can get the fuck out of my car

31:12.001 --> 31:14.671
and you can walk.
You want that?

31:14.672 --> 31:20.108
- You want to fucking walk home?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:20.109 --> 31:24.079
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself right now.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.517
You came and you picked me up.
I need your help, you helped me.

31:27.518 --> 31:31.227
I need your help. I'm sorry.

31:37.227 --> 31:38.631
You all right?

31:40.631 --> 31:43.132
Jesus, man!
What the fuck happened to you?

31:43.133 --> 31:45.668
- We got to get you to a hospital. Right now.
- No, no.

31:45.669 --> 31:48.236
- I just got to get home.
- Rob, it looks like you're bleeding inside, man.

31:48.237 --> 31:49.007
I'll deal with it
in a couple of hours.

31:50.007 --> 31:52.976
What if you don't make it
a couple of hours?

31:52.977 --> 31:55.229
Then I don't make it.

32:12.229 --> 32:14.364
- ( groans )
- Call me, all right?

32:14.365 --> 32:16.234
Let me know everything is okay.

32:18.234 --> 32:20.074
Yeah, it's best
we don't talk for a while.

32:24.074 --> 32:25.641
Hey, yo!

32:25.642 --> 32:27.410
So that's it?

32:27.411 --> 32:29.115
You get in a bind and just call
up the only nigga you know?

32:32.115 --> 32:34.486
Jimmy.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.589
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

32:39.589 --> 32:41.691
<i>- Go on home.
- Yeah, all right.</i>

32:41.692 --> 32:43.503
<i>- Just go.
- You take care of that.</i>

33:27.503 --> 33:28.284
Fuck!

33:40.284 --> 33:42.321
<i>Man: Everything okay, sir?</i>

33:45.321 --> 33:47.123
No, I'm fine, Glen.
Go back to bed.

34:20.123 --> 34:23.326
<i>- Ellen: Where did you go?
- What?</i>

34:23.327 --> 34:25.364
I woke up and you weren't here.

34:27.364 --> 34:31.737
- I just went to get some ice cream.
- Mm. Was it good?

34:34.737 --> 34:38.406
- Yes.
- Good.

34:38.407 --> 34:41.746
Don't forget to take your
Lipitor in the morning.

34:43.746 --> 34:46.818
- Ellen.
- Hmm?

34:48.818 --> 34:53.670
- Do you still love me?
- Of course I do.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.705
Hypothetically,
the situation you're describing

35:10.706 --> 35:12.908
would be
involuntary manslaughter.

35:12.909 --> 35:16.946
- Such a person...
- Would be in a lot of trouble.

35:16.947 --> 35:19.448
Especially if that person
were closing a merger

35:19.449 --> 35:20.750
with a large public bank

35:20.751 --> 35:23.886
where any publicity
or arrest could delay

35:23.887 --> 35:26.189
or derail the transaction,

35:26.190 --> 35:28.890
but that's only
if there were some evidence

35:28.891 --> 35:31.259
that could link him
to the crime.

35:31.260 --> 35:35.430
- Fingerprints? DNA?
- Very hard to collect after an explosion.

35:35.431 --> 35:38.670
Real world is different
from television.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.504
What about cell phone records?

35:42.505 --> 35:46.274
- Did this person make any calls from the area?
- Not from a cell phone. No.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.778
Then they won't be able
to place him there.

35:48.779 --> 35:52.948
What would you advise
such a person to do?

35:52.949 --> 35:56.352
To confess immediately.

35:56.353 --> 35:59.855
- Failing which?
- To put as much distance between himself

35:59.856 --> 36:02.959
<i>and the event as possible.
If possible.</i>

36:02.960 --> 36:06.361
But let me tell you something.

36:06.362 --> 36:09.497
And I'm speaking to you
as a friend now.

36:09.498 --> 36:12.500
There's about 50 things that
person wouldn't have thought of.

36:12.501 --> 36:16.738
And the more time that passes,
the more lies that are told,

36:16.739 --> 36:18.978
the worse it gets for him.

36:20.978 --> 36:23.812
<i>- Robert?
- Yeah?</i>

36:23.813 --> 36:27.850
- They're going to come to you.
- I know.

36:27.851 --> 36:30.886
An accident
is not the worst trouble.

36:30.887 --> 36:33.955
If we talk to them now,
we can probably work it out.

36:33.956 --> 36:36.692
Now you tell me what happens

36:36.693 --> 36:38.761
if the Standard deal
does not close.

36:38.762 --> 36:42.832
- I got to tell my investors about our real losses.
- Nothing good.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.800
What did you say about
the Justice Department?

36:44.801 --> 36:47.669
Depending on what they
decide to arrest me on?

36:47.670 --> 36:51.847
- Fraud conviction gets me 20 years?
- I did.

36:56.847 --> 37:00.530
What choice do I really have?

37:14.530 --> 37:16.764
<i>Man: Now, you're aware
Congress plans to extend</i>

37:16.765 --> 37:18.066
<i>the audit requirements
for private funds?</i>

37:18.067 --> 37:19.900
<i>Robert: Of course I am aware.</i>

37:19.901 --> 37:21.536
<i>I gave testimony
to the committee.</i>

37:21.537 --> 37:23.440
<i>- You know this.
- I know, but anyway,</i>

37:23.441 --> 37:25.441
Standard wants to prepare
for it now.

37:25.442 --> 37:27.543
So I was asked to go through
every one of your trading books

37:27.544 --> 37:31.314
<i>- and reconfirm the assets.
- No, no. Absolutely not. It's impossible.</i>

37:31.315 --> 37:33.083
Don't worry, I gave
different books to the team

37:33.084 --> 37:34.884
and I kept Old Hill for myself.

37:34.885 --> 37:37.953
Anyway, I'm here to tell you...
I cleared it.

37:37.954 --> 37:41.390
<i>- The audit's cleared?
- The report will be issued today.</i>

37:41.391 --> 37:43.695
Actually, I'm calling it
my "swan song."

37:45.695 --> 37:48.663
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, on Friday. You know, it's a five-year clock.

37:48.664 --> 37:52.600
- And why?
- To prevent exactly what we're doing, but honestly...

37:52.601 --> 37:56.372
<i>- ( phone ringing )
- ...there is nothing left to worry about. It's great.</i>

37:56.373 --> 37:59.978
<i>- Get out.
- Okay.</i>

38:02.978 --> 38:05.480
<i>- What?
- Gavin: How was it?</i>

38:05.481 --> 38:07.350
- What?
- The show.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.010
What the fuck are you
talking about?

38:09.018 --> 38:11.956
The show. Julie's show.

38:13.956 --> 38:16.424
Oh, yeah.

38:16.425 --> 38:18.526
Yeah, it was fine.

38:18.527 --> 38:20.030
- Mayfield's here.
- He's here? Where?

38:21.030 --> 38:23.430
<i>Sherry-Netherland. He checked
in about an hour ago.</i>

38:23.431 --> 38:25.902
- He called?
- No. Brooke has a friend on the executive committee

38:25.903 --> 38:28.870
<i>who said he's taking
meetings in his room.</i>

38:28.871 --> 38:30.842
I don't know.
Maybe he's settling in.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.377
You think we're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

38:34.378 --> 38:36.012
I spoke to legal. They said
that Standard will sign

38:37.012 --> 38:39.047
<i>once they get the audit report.</i>

38:39.048 --> 38:41.083
- Yeah, it's being issued now.
- How do you know that?

38:41.084 --> 38:43.886
Never mind that. Just find out
why Mayfield hasn't called us.

38:43.887 --> 38:46.522
- How am I supposed to--
- Do I have to do every goddamn thing myself?

38:46.523 --> 38:48.556
Just find out, will you?
Please?

38:48.557 --> 38:50.574
Thank you.

39:04.574 --> 39:08.511
- Brooke: I really can't reconcile this.
- Reconcile what?

39:08.512 --> 39:10.413
The Old Hill fund.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.784
Dad, are you listening to me?

39:13.784 --> 39:15.155
Yeah, of course I'm listening.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.790
Okay, those trades
are in the special book.

39:20.791 --> 39:23.426
They don't get audited here
on the same balance sheet.

39:23.427 --> 39:26.761
Wait, but look at the sheet.
There's a $400 million hole here.

39:26.762 --> 39:28.170
I mean, that can't be right.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.203
- Evening.
- May I help you?

39:35.204 --> 39:37.105
Detective Bryer.

39:37.106 --> 39:40.109
- I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.
- Is he expecting you?

39:40.110 --> 39:41.944
Possibly.

39:41.945 --> 39:44.146
<i>Brooke: I really have no
idea what's going on,</i>

39:44.147 --> 39:46.848
but the way
that this sheet reads...

39:46.849 --> 39:50.653
- half of the fund's assets are missing.
- That's ridiculous.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.989
- I mean, it can't be right.
- Right. It's ridiculous

39:52.990 --> 39:54.989
- and yet that's what--
- Okay, okay, look.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.059
<i>- I-- I'll look into this. I promise you.
- ( phone ringing )</i>

39:57.060 --> 39:59.794
I'll look into it.

39:59.795 --> 40:03.202
- Yeah.
- There's a Detective Bryer here to see you.

40:05.202 --> 40:08.203
- Eh, give me a minute, then send him in.
- Okay.

40:08.204 --> 40:11.707
- Thanks.
- Is everything okay?

40:11.708 --> 40:14.576
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just--

40:14.577 --> 40:16.146
my next meeting came here
a little early. That's all.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.848
We're going to have to pick
this up later.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.750
Mom is looking
for the hospital check.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.898
Brooke, we'll pick it up later.

40:34.898 --> 40:36.865
<i>Detective Bryer? Hi, I'm Cindy.</i>

40:36.866 --> 40:39.366
Mr. Miller's personal assistant.
Right this way.

40:51.047 --> 40:53.883
Yeah, sorry to keep you waiting.
You can sit there.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.651
<i>We just heard about it.
Really terrible.</i>

40:56.652 --> 40:58.722
<i>- Bryer: Okay, so you're an investor in the gallery?
- Correct.</i>

40:58.723 --> 41:03.591
- How did you meet her?
- Eh... through-- I think it was a charity function.

41:03.592 --> 41:06.761
- My wife and I have a foundation.
- Okay.

41:06.762 --> 41:11.165
- When did you last see her?
- Last night. At the gallery.

41:11.166 --> 41:14.569
<i>- You stayed till the doors closed?
- No, I--</i>

41:14.570 --> 41:17.272
I was only there a couple of minutes.
I think I left around 10.

41:17.273 --> 41:20.142
- Where did you go?
- Home.

41:20.143 --> 41:21.012
<i>- You go straight home?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

41:22.012 --> 41:23.745
- You stayed home?
- Yeah.

41:23.746 --> 41:27.283
- Your wife home?
- Yes.

41:27.284 --> 41:31.620
Okay. Okay, so now
back to the gallery.

41:31.621 --> 41:35.124
<i>- Did you see her with anyone?
- See her-- what do you mean?</i>

41:35.125 --> 41:38.195
<i>I mean, like, boyfriend. Someone
she might of left with?</i>

41:40.195 --> 41:42.297
Not that I noticed. No, no.

41:42.298 --> 41:46.201
The reason I ask is
we haven't located the driver.

41:46.202 --> 41:47.771
<i>- The driver?
- Yeah, the driver.</i>

41:47.772 --> 41:50.738
Someone else was driving. So...

41:50.739 --> 41:54.042
sometimes the driver
will go for help

41:54.043 --> 41:56.745
and he'll die tryin'--
you know,

41:56.746 --> 41:58.046
- so--
- This is awful.

41:58.047 --> 41:59.016
<i>- Yeah.
- This is truly awful.</i>

42:00.016 --> 42:02.116
We're searching
the area right now.

42:02.117 --> 42:05.888
<i>So no boyfriend, no--
that you know of?</i>

42:05.889 --> 42:07.824
Actually, we didn't talk
about personal matters.

42:07.825 --> 42:10.759
- She was just an employee, right?
- She-- well, not an employee.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.628
- I was an investor.
- Why did you invest?

42:12.629 --> 42:14.930
- Why did I invest?
- Yeah, why did you invest?

42:14.931 --> 42:20.301
She had a great eye. She-- actually,
she found me these Brice Mardens here.

42:20.302 --> 42:22.837
<i>They went up in value
very quickly,</i>

42:22.838 --> 42:25.775
and it was on the basis of that that I
agreed to fund some of the gallery.

42:25.776 --> 42:29.178
All right. Do you mind
if we search her apartment?

42:29.179 --> 42:32.714
- Why would I mind?
- Well, it's in your company's name. So...

42:32.715 --> 42:35.951
Right. Oh, yeah. Of course.

42:35.952 --> 42:37.919
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

42:37.920 --> 42:42.890
<i>- Now, Mr. Miller.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

42:42.891 --> 42:45.627
Why would you lease
an apartment for Miss Cote?

42:45.628 --> 42:48.696
I mean, is that something that you
would normally do for an employee?

42:48.697 --> 42:50.766
Well, actually, I said
that she wasn't an employee.

42:50.767 --> 42:54.335
But she-- I think she'd
just come over from Paris,

42:54.336 --> 42:57.238
if I remember, and she needed
a place to entertain buyers.

42:57.239 --> 42:58.806
So you leased her an apartment?

42:58.807 --> 43:01.243
Well, it was through
the holding company.

43:01.244 --> 43:03.014
You are a little confused by all
this, aren't you? ( laughs )

43:04.014 --> 43:07.883
- I am, I am, but I'll get there. Give me time.
- All right.

43:07.884 --> 43:11.352
Now I don't mean to be
indelicate, but--

43:11.353 --> 43:13.988
But you're going to
be indelicate.

43:13.989 --> 43:16.991
From what I can gather, she
wasn't exactly an art star.

43:16.992 --> 43:19.161
<i>She worked for a couple
of dealers in Paris, but--</i>

43:19.162 --> 43:22.263
Okay, I get it. So why would I invest
in her and help her find a place?

43:22.264 --> 43:24.001
<i>- Something like that, yeah.
- It's very simple, Detective.</i>

43:25.001 --> 43:28.037
I invest in people
I believe in.

43:28.038 --> 43:31.874
I thought she'd do well.
I backed her, she did.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.410
- It's as simple as that.
- Well, that seems to make sense.

43:34.411 --> 43:37.879
- Yeah.
- We all good with the apartment, then, right?

43:37.880 --> 43:40.114
- Yeah, yeah. That's fine. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

43:40.115 --> 43:42.417
- What happened to your head?
- What?

43:42.418 --> 43:44.751
Your head. What happened to
your head? That's a nasty cut.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.119
I've been looking at that
for the last five minutes.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.023
- Does it hurt you?
- No, no, no. I just--

43:48.023 --> 43:51.829
- I hit it on the medicine cabinet.
- Last night?

43:52.829 --> 43:55.464
- This morning.
- Hate when that happens.

43:55.465 --> 43:59.167
- Me, too.
- Yeah. Well, thanks for the chat.

43:59.168 --> 44:01.143
No problem.

44:08.143 --> 44:11.245
- ( phone ringing )
- Ellen Miller's office.

44:11.246 --> 44:14.415
And it transformed them.
Seriously.

44:14.416 --> 44:16.852
There's a Detective Bryer
in the lobby.

44:16.853 --> 44:18.986
And thanks again
for your generosity.

44:18.987 --> 44:21.256
All right. I'll see you then.
Bye-bye.

44:21.257 --> 44:23.759
- Sorry, what?
- A Detective Bryer.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.893
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

44:25.894 --> 44:29.098
Well, I'm late, so I just
can't deal with it right now.

44:29.099 --> 44:30.601
- Okay. What about these?
- Send them a thank-you note.

44:30.602 --> 44:33.876
- Zappos has been so generous. Thanks. Bye, guys.
- Okay. No problem.

44:40.876 --> 44:43.278
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

44:43.279 --> 44:46.314
- Detective Bryer.
- Did you just call my office?

44:46.315 --> 44:48.451
- Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
- I don't have time right now.

44:48.452 --> 44:51.185
- Sorry.
- It will just take a couple of seconds.

44:51.186 --> 44:55.849
- This is about your husband.
- Well, fine, but make an appointment.

45:19.849 --> 45:24.085
- How'd it go?
- Well, the wife blew me off.

45:24.086 --> 45:27.055
Which was interesting.

45:27.056 --> 45:29.425
He didn't admit to the affair,
but then he wouldn't, would he?

45:29.426 --> 45:32.998
- Why didn't you pick him out?
- He's a very rich man.

45:34.998 --> 45:38.399
- Anything?
- Yeah, about 10 million prints.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.568
- What happened with the pay phones?
- Got about 15 calls

45:40.569 --> 45:42.806
in a three-mile-- two of them
look a little strange.

45:42.807 --> 45:45.306
Got an incoming, which is
probably a local drug deal.

45:45.307 --> 45:47.010
- And the one we care about?
- Collect call. About a minute and a half.

45:48.010 --> 45:51.180
- Made from the Chevron station on Westlake Road.
- Who'd he call?

45:51.181 --> 45:55.551
Cell phone in Harlem.
Still waiting on the address.

45:55.552 --> 45:59.187
So you're at the crash site.

45:59.188 --> 46:03.457
All right, and you
make it out of the car.

46:03.458 --> 46:06.060
Now you're smart enough

46:06.061 --> 46:07.562
not to use your own cell phone.

46:07.563 --> 46:11.033
So you get to a pay phone
and you're a billionaire.

46:11.034 --> 46:13.602
Right? You're a billionaire.

46:13.603 --> 46:16.337
So what do you do?

46:16.338 --> 46:18.012
You call someone in Harlem?

46:23.012 --> 46:25.180
Robert?

46:25.181 --> 46:28.317
I just heard about Julie.
I'm so sorry.

46:28.318 --> 46:31.453
Her gallery called.
Her mom's flying in today.

46:31.454 --> 46:34.455
Her mom.

46:34.456 --> 46:37.192
- Service here?
- Tomorrow. 9:00 a.m.

46:37.193 --> 46:39.493
Wow. We should pick up
the expenses for that.

46:39.494 --> 46:41.330
Whatever she wants.

46:41.331 --> 46:42.931
You take care of that
personally for me?

46:42.932 --> 46:44.366
- Of course.
- Thanks.

46:44.367 --> 46:47.935
- You all right?
- Did you get ahold of Mayfield?

46:47.936 --> 46:49.338
<i>- No. Not yet, but we'll get him.
- ( elevator bell dings )</i>

46:49.339 --> 46:53.911
<i>- Robert? I--
- Thanks.</i>

46:54.911 --> 46:56.418
I appreciate your concern.

47:02.418 --> 47:05.953
<i>Mills: Let's flash
him, let's flash him.</i>

47:05.954 --> 47:08.457
<i>- ( tires screeching )
- Hold on, you gonna go--</i>

47:08.458 --> 47:11.326
- Wait, right here. Mr. Grant?
- Yes.

47:11.327 --> 47:13.931
NYPD Homicide. Do you mind
stepping in the car, please?

47:14.931 --> 47:16.465
- What's this about?
- Just get in the car, Jimmy.

47:16.466 --> 47:19.304
- Am I under arrest?
- Do you want to be?

47:22.304 --> 47:26.607
- So let's do this again.
- Man, for what? My answers ain't going to change.

47:26.608 --> 47:29.512
- So you're asleep...
- Right.

47:30.512 --> 47:33.180
- and the phone rings...
- Right.

47:33.181 --> 47:35.320
and it's a wrong number.

47:37.320 --> 47:40.689
Why do you accept the charges on a
collect call from a wrong number?

47:40.690 --> 47:42.925
I don't think I want to answer
any more questions.

47:42.926 --> 47:46.395
And then...
you stay on the phone

47:46.396 --> 47:48.964
for a minute and a half
with a wrong number.

47:48.965 --> 47:50.000
What the fuck do you
talk about? Area codes?

47:51.000 --> 47:53.034
<i>- I want to talk to my lawyer.
- Mills: Listen, big man.</i>

47:53.035 --> 47:54.200
We know you went down there.

47:54.201 --> 47:55.538
We ID'd your photo
with your neighbor,

47:55.539 --> 47:58.306
who saw you get into your truck 10
minutes after the call was made.

47:58.307 --> 48:00.476
If you got all that, what the
fuck do you need me for, Officer?

48:00.477 --> 48:02.477
I don't think you
understand the gravity

48:02.478 --> 48:05.516
of the situation here, Jimmy.

48:06.516 --> 48:10.654
- This is a homicide.
- Lawyer.

48:11.654 --> 48:14.656
- You're going to sign him out?
- I called in Earl Monroe.

48:14.657 --> 48:19.428
- The basketball player?
- Civil rights attorney.

48:19.429 --> 48:22.230
- Remember Crown Heights?
- He's the best?

48:22.231 --> 48:25.167
He's the best
above 96th Street.

48:25.168 --> 48:27.539
<i>That doesn't make him
any cheaper.</i>

48:30.539 --> 48:32.174
You got to get Jimmy
out of this.

48:32.175 --> 48:34.442
Might not be that easy.

48:34.443 --> 48:38.680
If he doesn't cooperate, they're
likely to indict him on obstruction.

48:38.681 --> 48:41.750
- What would he be looking at?
- Hard to say.

48:41.751 --> 48:45.354
With his prior, five years.
Maybe 10.

48:45.355 --> 48:47.494
Jesus.

48:52.494 --> 48:54.395
Hey.

48:54.396 --> 48:56.706
This is not going to go away.

49:04.706 --> 49:08.209
Okay. I'm going to call you
tomorrow if there's any news.

49:08.210 --> 49:10.678
Don't you worry
about anything here.

49:10.679 --> 49:13.163
Don't talk to anyone else.
Take care.

49:27.163 --> 49:29.400
Come on. Get in.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.435
All you said was you needed a fucking ride.
You didn't tell me you killed that girl.

49:34.436 --> 49:37.138
- Jimmy, I didn't--
- I'm trying to put my life back together.

49:37.139 --> 49:39.606
Okay. I appreciate you helped us,
but now you're taking it too far.

49:39.607 --> 49:41.508
- It's going to be okay, Jimmy.
- Like it was your ass sitting there.

49:41.509 --> 49:43.579
<i>Like you know a fucking thing
about how it's going to be.</i>

49:43.580 --> 49:45.613
We got you the best criminal
lawyer in the city.

49:45.614 --> 49:47.414
Don't you got
your own son for this?

49:47.415 --> 49:49.617
- Why the hell you didn't call him?
- Because he would have

49:49.618 --> 49:52.286
- fucked it up, all right?
- Okay. Well, I'm sorry your son is a fucking idiot,

49:52.287 --> 49:54.056
- but that ain't my fault.
- This isn't productive.

49:54.057 --> 49:55.591
Oh, okay, then, Syd.

49:55.592 --> 49:59.127
- Tell us, what happens now?
- We meet with Earl and we go from there.

49:59.128 --> 50:02.095
I understand right now they don't have
enough to charge you with anything.

50:02.096 --> 50:04.166
<i>- You're under suspicion.
- Under suspicion?</i>

50:04.167 --> 50:07.669
- Motherfucker, I'm black!
- I am aware of that.

50:07.670 --> 50:10.106
And what exactly would you
like me to do about it?

50:10.107 --> 50:13.375
Gentlemen, my driver will take
you where you want to go,

50:13.376 --> 50:16.410
but I cannot be a party
to this conversation.

50:16.411 --> 50:18.452
So this is where I get out.

50:23.452 --> 50:25.822
<i>- Why couldn't you have just stayed?
- I couldn't.</i>

50:25.823 --> 50:29.857
- Why not?
- Because I have responsibilities.

50:29.858 --> 50:31.626
If I stayed there, a lot of
people would have gotten hurt.

50:31.627 --> 50:34.763
- Well, somebody was hurt.
- Other people, Jimmy.

50:34.764 --> 50:37.098
I got business troubles,
you understand?

50:37.099 --> 50:38.503
People rely on me.

50:40.503 --> 50:42.702
Listen, I want to talk
to you a second. Come here.

50:42.703 --> 50:44.440
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

50:44.441 --> 50:46.646
Just for a second. Come here.

50:51.646 --> 50:54.883
- Now, you know your father asked me to look after you.
- Yeah.

50:54.884 --> 50:59.254
Yeah. I know, I know.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

50:59.255 --> 51:01.724
But I do want to help you.
You know that.

51:02.724 --> 51:06.132
<i>So I've been able to set up
a situation for you.</i>

51:09.132 --> 51:11.165
- What's that?
- This is a trust.

51:11.166 --> 51:14.268
In your name,
assets of $2 million.

51:14.269 --> 51:16.671
- Take a look at that.
- Are you serious?

51:16.672 --> 51:18.839
You think money
is going to fix this?

51:18.840 --> 51:21.813
- Huh?
- What else is there?

51:23.813 --> 51:27.681
- What are you doing?
- Yo, man. Pull over.

51:27.682 --> 51:29.621
What are you doing?

51:31.621 --> 51:34.622
- What are you going to do?
- Do I look like a fucking snitch to you?

51:34.623 --> 51:37.295
I don't know, Jimmy.
I don't know. Are you?

51:39.295 --> 51:41.462
Wait, wait, wait. Look, sorry.

51:41.463 --> 51:44.665
Just read it. Just take
it home and read it.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.942
It's not going to hurt you.

51:52.942 --> 51:54.780
<i>( cell phone vibrating )</i>

51:58.780 --> 52:01.515
- Yeah?
- I've got Chris Vogler from Fremaut Accounting.

52:01.516 --> 52:05.453
- You asked me to interrupt you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put him through.

52:05.454 --> 52:07.923
<i>- Chris?
- Robert, I've run into some problems.</i>

52:07.924 --> 52:10.424
<i>- Look, we're doing a non-recommend.
- What?</i>

52:10.425 --> 52:13.662
<i>- They got compliance involved, I'm sorry.
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait.</i>

52:13.663 --> 52:15.763
<i>- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- I've got to go.</i>

52:15.764 --> 52:19.239
Chris! Ch-- God damn it, Chris!

52:23.239 --> 52:26.540
Oh, Peter. Listen. I'm looking
at some statements right now.

52:26.541 --> 52:29.944
<i>- How much did you book last quarter?
- Why?</i>

52:29.945 --> 52:33.714
<i>- Eh, what do you care?
- Peter, I'm really just asking you.</i>

52:33.715 --> 52:36.317
<i>- All right, eh, 35.
- 35 million for your whole group?</i>

52:36.318 --> 52:38.653
<i>Yes. 35 million
for my entire group.</i>

52:38.654 --> 52:42.524
<i>- You sure it wasn't 68?
- What? 35 million isn't a big enough number for you?</i>

52:42.525 --> 52:45.660
<i>- I know that it's a big number.
- Well, what the fuck are you--</i>

52:45.661 --> 52:48.306
<i>- No-- Peter, I'll call you later.
- What do you want?</i>

52:58.306 --> 53:00.577
What are you doing
in my office?

53:01.577 --> 53:02.880
Eh, hello?

53:04.880 --> 53:06.948
- Can you explain these?
- Explain what?

53:06.949 --> 53:10.454
Old Hill. All the
numbers you falsified?

53:11.454 --> 53:12.891
You don't know
what you're saying.

53:16.891 --> 53:18.593
- Get out of my way.
- Brooke.

53:18.594 --> 53:21.733
- You're hurting my arm.
- Can't you just leave it alone?

53:24.733 --> 53:27.535
- You're fired, Ben.
- You can't fire me.

53:27.536 --> 53:31.878
- Oh, I just did.
- Who do you think asked me to make those changes?

53:36.878 --> 53:38.413
You tell me.

53:38.414 --> 53:41.415
<i>Mills: He was doing a little dealing a while back.
Looks like he stopped.</i>

53:41.416 --> 53:44.051
<i>- Man: Any family?
- Eh, they're all dead.</i>

53:44.052 --> 53:47.455
Kid's a good student.
Magnet school. Whatever.

53:47.456 --> 53:50.558
Then his mom dies and he gets
popped for gun possession.

53:50.559 --> 53:53.630
<i>- Even so, how come he got probation?
- He had an excellent lawyer.</i>

53:55.630 --> 53:57.900
How the fuck could this kid
afford Felder & Chos?

53:57.901 --> 54:00.768
Well, we pulled
his parents' tax returns.

54:00.769 --> 54:02.539
Guess where his father
worked for 20 years.

54:04.539 --> 54:06.674
<i>Miller Capital?</i>

54:06.675 --> 54:09.410
He was the fucking driver?

54:09.411 --> 54:11.413
Oh, wow.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.384
Oh, this guy's good.

54:15.384 --> 54:18.085
- Where are you at with the kid?
- So far, he won't budge.

54:18.086 --> 54:19.754
Well, he's a convicted felon.

54:19.755 --> 54:21.589
We'll get a warrant.

54:21.590 --> 54:23.792
Put him in front
of a grand jury.

54:23.793 --> 54:25.793
<i>Let's see how long
he holds out when he realizes</i>

54:25.794 --> 54:27.074
<i>he's looking at 10 years
off the prior.</i>

54:38.074 --> 54:40.709
I'm sorry. Mr. Miller,
as I explained from downstairs,

54:40.710 --> 54:42.776
- he's on a call right-- Mr. Miller!
- Whoa.

54:42.777 --> 54:44.880
<i>- Robert, what the fuck--
- Tell me what is going on.</i>

54:44.881 --> 54:47.381
- I can't.
- Tell me what the fuck is going on!

54:47.382 --> 54:48.818
- I can't, I can't!
- This is my life!

54:48.819 --> 54:51.685
I know. It's not me!
Okay. The audit--

54:51.686 --> 54:54.689
- What?
- The audit passed. It passed a week ago, like I said.

54:54.690 --> 54:57.625
Okay. Everything is fine. Money's confirmed.
It's all straight and done.

54:57.626 --> 55:00.828
- It really is.
- Why did you tell me that it didn't?

55:00.829 --> 55:03.568
<i>- Because they asked me to hold it. Okay?
- Who's they?</i>

55:05.568 --> 55:08.610
- Who is they?!
- Mayfield.

55:14.610 --> 55:16.088
Mayfield.

55:26.088 --> 55:28.823
<i>What?</i>

55:28.824 --> 55:31.847
They're negotiating.
He wants a better price.

55:51.847 --> 55:53.580
Sherry-Netherland?

55:53.581 --> 55:55.750
Yes. James Mayfield, please.

55:55.751 --> 55:58.419
Mr. Mayfield. Uh-huh.

55:58.420 --> 56:01.122
I think it's time
we had a talk.

56:01.123 --> 56:03.456
- It's not going to hold.
- The warrant doesn't need to hold.

56:03.457 --> 56:05.527
It just needs to scare him
into giving up Miller.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.694
What is it, Mike? You
stalled that big career,

56:07.695 --> 56:08.898
so you're reaching
for a high note?

56:08.899 --> 56:11.098
Who gives a fuck?

56:11.099 --> 56:13.134
This is about
Judge Rittenband, right?

56:13.135 --> 56:15.436
- This is 'cause he's running again?
- You want to cost the judge

56:15.437 --> 56:16.871
his seat
on a profiling claim...

56:16.872 --> 56:19.207
against Earl Monroe?

56:19.208 --> 56:21.810
I'm getting a new piece of evidence
that's going to seal it 100%.

56:21.811 --> 56:23.612
Good. Bring it back
to me when you got it.

56:23.613 --> 56:27.181
You can have it in your hand
before you go in the jury room.

56:27.182 --> 56:29.049
Look, Ray.

56:29.050 --> 56:31.986
We like this kid.
I don't want to lose him.

56:31.987 --> 56:34.488
Think about it. If we flip
him, you get Robert Miller,

56:34.489 --> 56:37.192
and what's that worth
to Rittenband?

56:37.193 --> 56:39.028
Or to you for that matter?

56:40.028 --> 56:42.730
20 fucking years.

56:42.731 --> 56:46.067
Ray, 20 years we've watched these guys.
They out-lawyer us, they out-buy us.

56:46.068 --> 56:49.837
I'm fucking sick of it. Where's
the consequence? The guy did it.

56:49.838 --> 56:53.040
He does not get to walk
just because he's on CNBC.

56:53.041 --> 56:55.014
Give me the warrant.

57:00.014 --> 57:02.262
You better not fuck me.

57:13.262 --> 57:17.744
Yeah. I need
a serious fucking favor.

57:28.744 --> 57:31.578
- Brooke's waiting for you.
- We had a meeting?

57:31.579 --> 57:33.617
No, but she looked upset.

57:35.617 --> 57:37.219
<i>Robert: Sweetie, you okay?</i>

57:38.219 --> 57:40.206
What's wrong?

57:57.206 --> 58:00.114
- You want to sit?
- I'll stand.

58:06.114 --> 58:09.917
- Didn't you think I'd find out?
- I did.

58:09.918 --> 58:12.221
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I hoped you wouldn't.

58:12.222 --> 58:15.055
Oh, come on.

58:15.056 --> 58:17.726
You tell me the truth
now or I am done.

58:18.726 --> 58:21.065
- I made a bad bet.
- No, you committed fraud.

58:23.065 --> 58:25.166
- That's a dangerous word.
- What would you prefer?

58:25.167 --> 58:28.803
That you cheated?

58:28.804 --> 58:30.005
That you stole money
from people who trust you?

58:31.005 --> 58:33.774
That you lied-- that you
lied right to my face?!

58:33.775 --> 58:37.078
- Why?
- Because we were going broke.

58:37.079 --> 58:39.113
Everything was finished.

58:39.114 --> 58:41.250
- We'd have nothing.
- How? How does that happen?

58:41.251 --> 58:43.817
<i>How? ( scoffs )</i>

58:43.818 --> 58:46.187
<i>You remember Alexandrov?</i>

58:46.188 --> 58:49.357
He came to see me
one day last year.

58:49.358 --> 58:51.326
He said, "Robert,

58:51.327 --> 58:53.127
you got a great opportunity.

58:53.128 --> 58:55.730
There's a copper mine in Russia.
It's under-exploited,

58:55.731 --> 58:57.832
there's billions
under the ground.

58:57.833 --> 59:00.135
To get it out, all we need
is a couple hundred million.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.971
You put in 100,
we'll put in 100.

59:02.972 --> 59:05.309
We'll triple it in six months."

59:07.309 --> 59:10.278
<i>I was skeptical,
so I go check it out.</i>

59:10.279 --> 59:13.881
<i>Geological survey's right.
Friendly government.</i>

59:13.882 --> 59:18.252
And to lock it in,
you hedge it.

59:18.253 --> 59:21.656
Right? We sell
the copper ahead.

59:21.657 --> 59:24.158
Commodities exchange and it all works.
It's fine.

59:24.159 --> 59:26.627
We're making a fortune.

59:26.628 --> 59:29.798
<i>And then there's something
that I hadn't accounted for.</i>

59:30.798 --> 59:32.001
A variation margin.

59:33.001 --> 59:35.903
And that friendly Russian
government-- not so friendly anymore.

59:35.904 --> 59:37.971
They're blocking
the exported copper.

59:37.972 --> 59:41.642
<i>So I got to pony up. I got to put
the cash in to cover the hedge.</i>

59:41.643 --> 59:43.409
But I'm not worried about it because
it's still springing money.

59:43.410 --> 59:45.380
There's so much money
coming out of this ground,

59:45.381 --> 59:48.181
you can't believe it.
You can't-- you can't stop it.

59:48.182 --> 59:50.384
Yes. I'm the oracle.

59:50.385 --> 59:54.821
I have done housing. I've arb'd credit swaps.
I have done it all.

59:54.822 --> 59:58.058
Yes. I know
it's outside the charter,

59:58.059 --> 59:59.028
but it is fucking
minting money.

01:00:00.028 --> 01:00:02.763
It is-- it's a license
to print money for everybody.

01:00:02.764 --> 01:00:05.836
Forever! It is God.

01:00:08.836 --> 01:00:12.774
- Until?
- Until it's not.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:16.243
The money's trapped.
I can't get it out.

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:18.680
I probably never will.

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.016
It's like a plane crash.
It just happens.

01:00:21.016 --> 01:00:23.750
<i>- It does not just happen.
- It just happened, honey.</i>

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:27.721
You are so naive sometimes. You're
young, but you're not that young.

01:00:27.722 --> 01:00:29.691
It happens.

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.426
And like any father, I pray
that it doesn't happen to you.

01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:36.296
- Happily, because of me, it won't happen to you.
- Thanks to you,

01:00:36.297 --> 01:00:38.034
- we all may be arrested.
- No one's getting arrested.

01:00:40.034 --> 01:00:42.403
That's why I borrowed
the money from Jeffrey.

01:00:42.404 --> 01:00:44.171
Plugged the hole.

01:00:44.172 --> 01:00:46.707
They see that
the books are fine.

01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:50.477
Transfer the company, I pay
back Jeffrey with interest.

01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:54.281
I make all our investors whole
and what's left, we keep.

01:00:54.282 --> 01:00:56.117
<i>At least we get to keep
the house.</i>

01:00:56.118 --> 01:00:58.085
- Everybody wins.
- Yes.

01:00:58.086 --> 01:01:00.855
- If we sell the company.
- It'll sell.

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:03.056
- If I lie for you.
- You don't have to lie.

01:01:03.057 --> 01:01:04.925
You didn't know about it.
That's why I didn't tell you.

01:01:04.926 --> 01:01:06.529
I'm the chief investment
officer of this company.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.730
What do you think they're going to say
at the deposition? "She didn't know"?

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:11.866
They'll take away
my brokerage license.

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:13.468
Failure to supervise you.

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:16.404
My name in every paper and blog
while I visit your ass in jail!

01:01:16.405 --> 01:01:19.307
What do you want me to do? Did you
want to let our investors go bankrupt?

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:22.176
Is that what you wanted? You
wanted people to get really hurt?!

01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:24.179
- What gives you the audacity to think that you..
- You want those lives--

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.747
- ...can make others--
- Because it's my job!

01:01:26.748 --> 01:01:28.883
- Job? It's illegal.
- Yes.

01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:31.319
It's illegal
and I am your partner.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.154
You are not my partner.
You work for me.

01:01:34.155 --> 01:01:36.128
That's right. You work for me.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.404
Everybody works for me.

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:52.105
Come here. Brooke. Please.

01:01:52.106 --> 01:01:55.475
Please. Come here. Just--

01:01:55.476 --> 01:01:57.052
just for a second. Sit down.

01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:07.421
<i>There's something
I want to tell you.</i>

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:10.893
<i>Whatever you decide,
I won't blame you.</i>

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:13.831
I'm on my own path.

01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:18.799
It's up to you to move
with it or against it.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.971
<i>But I'm the patriarch.
That's my role.</i>

01:02:22.971 --> 01:02:24.909
I have to play it.

01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:30.193
For a moment there, I thought you
were going to say you're sorry.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.902
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:55.903
Hey, Jimmy.

01:02:55.904 --> 01:02:58.973
- Come on, man. What?
- Take a ride with me.

01:02:58.974 --> 01:03:02.911
- Where? Back to the station?
- No, man. Just get in the car.

01:03:03.911 --> 01:03:06.613
- What if I say no?
- I'm not threatening you.

01:03:06.614 --> 01:03:09.862
I'm just asking you.
Take a ride with me.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:22.462
<i>( door slams, engine starts )</i>

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:25.933
Wasting my time,
Detective. What?

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:28.201
Well, it's pretty
fucking simple.

01:03:28.202 --> 01:03:30.071
I know you went to pick him up.

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.406
So that's what you want
to talk about?

01:03:32.407 --> 01:03:35.509
- I told you, I ain't making no more statements.
- And I know why.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.514
- Somebody cares?
- Here. Take a look at this.

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.348
Take it.

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:43.951
I got his phone calls.
I got his text messages.

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:47.087
I got his relationship
with the girl.

01:03:47.088 --> 01:03:49.357
They were fucking, by the way.

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.993
<i>And then I got you.</i>

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.361
I got the time log
from the pay phone.

01:03:54.362 --> 01:03:57.098
I got a fucking
tollbooth photograph

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.269
of you driving your car
through the Triborough.

01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:03.504
Where you got that?

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:07.107
That's bullshit 'cause I ain't do it.
It's impossible.

01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:09.643
Really?

01:04:09.644 --> 01:04:12.480
Look, you lied to me.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:15.482
<i>You lied to the police.
You obstructed justice.</i>

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:18.451
- Talk to Earl, Detective.
- Fuck Earl. You see this?

01:04:18.452 --> 01:04:21.355
This means that tomorrow,

01:04:21.356 --> 01:04:23.556
grand jury hears
your case in court.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:27.995
<i>And tomorrow in court, I'm going to ask
for a felony obstruction indictment.</i>

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:31.198
With your prior, you're going
to prison for 15 fucking years.

01:04:31.199 --> 01:04:35.303
You might get out in 10,
but then you'll be, what? 33?

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:38.376
<i>With no job. No girl. No life.</i>

01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:45.379
Look. I know you think
Miller's your friend.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.716
- Who's Miller?
- I know about your father.

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:50.652
You don't know a goddamn
thing about my father.

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:53.955
I know that Miller paid
his bills while he was dying.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:56.457
I know he got Syd Felder

01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:58.393
to get you out of trouble
on your gun charge.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:01.095
<i>- That doesn't add up to this.
- You done?</i>

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:04.564
Okay. He's driving...

01:05:04.565 --> 01:05:07.067
<i>he crashes, he runs away.</i>

01:05:07.068 --> 01:05:09.471
Who's he call? He calls you.
Why do you think that is?

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:11.439
<i>Because you're disposable.</i>

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.642
You're the one person he can call
that just doesn't fucking matter.

01:05:14.643 --> 01:05:16.409
<i>- You're a-- you're a-- throwaway.
- Yeah.</i>

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:18.581
<i>You're just another part
of his transaction.</i>

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:23.616
<i>- Will you open the door?
- So what? You're his new nigga now?</i>

01:05:23.617 --> 01:05:25.486
Open-- open the fucking door!

01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:27.489
I'm not fucking playin'
with you, man. Open the door.

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.191
You didn't kill that girl.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:34.630
<i>- He did.
- Will you open the door?</i>

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.598
He's using you.

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:39.001
<i>I know it. You know it.</i>

01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:41.634
<i>Do the right thing.</i>

01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:43.577
<i>Now get out of my fucking car.</i>

01:05:49.577 --> 01:05:52.513
<i>- Robert: What do you think?
- Felder: He's going to walk.</i>

01:05:52.514 --> 01:05:54.314
You're certain?

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:56.250
Courts aren't for certainty,

01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:59.053
but he says he was at home.
Why shouldn't he be?

01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:01.087
Phone call
doesn't make him a liar.

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:05.058
- It's not great.
- What's baffling to me, though,

01:06:05.059 --> 01:06:07.127
despite your sentimental
history together,

01:06:07.128 --> 01:06:11.237
is why you would put your family's
future in this kid's hands.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.672
He's not like us.

01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:20.349
Is that a good thing?

01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:29.585
I don't know.

01:06:31.585 --> 01:06:36.826
- How's Ellen?
- She's good. Fine. Same.

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:40.329
- Why?
- I heard something.

01:06:42.329 --> 01:06:46.634
- Yes?
- She met with Gil Deustchman.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.803
- The estate lawyer?
- Yeah.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.507
Has she mentioned anything?

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:55.519
Not to me.

01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:07.856
<i>Deferlito: That was the early
morning of April 11th.</i>

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.658
<i>- Yes.
- You received a phone call?</i>

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:13.727
<i>- Yes.
- Who called you?</i>

01:07:13.728 --> 01:07:17.363
- It was a wrong number.
- That's a lie. Isn't it, Mr. Grant?

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:19.767
No.

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:22.636
<i>You were on the phone
one and a half minutes.</i>

01:07:22.637 --> 01:07:25.239
<i>Isn't it the case you know exactly
who called you and exactly why?</i>

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.514
<i>- Why are you lying to this grand jury?
- I'm not lying.</i>

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:35.816
I'm going to introduce
into evidence People's A.

01:07:35.817 --> 01:07:38.618
<i>This is a tollbooth photograph</i>

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:41.788
taken in the northbound
ninth lane of Triborough--

01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:44.260
excuse me, the RFK Bridge.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.131
Mr. Grant, directing your
attention to the photograph.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:53.399
Would you please read
the date and time stamp

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.240
indicated on
the upper right-hand corner.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.843
- This is crazy.
- You've got to answer.

01:08:03.844 --> 01:08:05.516
Mr. Grant,
please answer the question.

01:08:08.516 --> 01:08:11.551
April 11th, 2:33 a.m.

01:08:11.552 --> 01:08:13.822
Again, directing your attention
to the same photograph.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.322
Would you please read
the license plate

01:08:16.323 --> 01:08:18.661
of the vehicle passing
through the toll?

01:08:19.661 --> 01:08:22.595
A-O-C-8-9-6-3.

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:23.997
This is People's B.

01:08:23.997 --> 01:08:28.402
A printout from the Department of
Motor Vehicles plate registry.

01:08:28.403 --> 01:08:31.438
<i>Mr. Grant, directing your
attention to that printout.</i>

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.573
<i>Are the numbers
on the toll photograph</i>

01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:36.912
<i>the same ones that are
on your own license plate?</i>

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:41.948
<i>- Mr. Grant?
- Yes.</i>

01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:44.785
<i>- Yes, the numbers are the same?
- Yes.</i>

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:46.786
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:49.822
But that is...

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:52.626
your car in this photograph.
Isn't it?

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:55.667
- No.
- No, that is not your car?

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.401
Answer the question, Mr. Grant.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:03.203
This is not my car
in this picture.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:06.840
I don't know how y'all did that,
but this isn't my car.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:09.809
<i>You expect this grand jury
to believe that,</i>

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.247
<i>that is not your car,
when there is a printout</i>

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:15.381
from the Department
of Motor Vehicles?

01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:17.349
<i>- That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
- Mr. Monroe,</i>

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.832
you are aware that you're not
permitted to go on record?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.832
Jimmy.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:34.667
- Jimmy, Jimmy, wait.
- What?

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:36.403
- What was that?
- They're lying.

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:39.939
- Okay. Now here's--
- You can halt the decision.

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:41.774
Detective,
we need a minute, please.

01:09:41.776 --> 01:09:43.844
How about you, Jimmy?
You need a minute?

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.845
- Because if you do--
- Get the fuck out of my face. How about that?

01:09:46.846 --> 01:09:48.448
So you want to keep
playing games

01:09:48.448 --> 01:09:49.881
or are you ready
to tell me something?

01:09:49.883 --> 01:09:51.683
<i>Detective, I need to speak
with my client.</i>

01:09:51.684 --> 01:09:52.921
So now if you would
just please--

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:55.555
How-- how are y'all just
going to lie like that? Huh?

01:09:55.556 --> 01:09:57.658
- How are y'all just gonna lie?
- We didn't lie. You lied.

01:09:57.659 --> 01:10:00.260
- That wasn't my car.
- Jimmy, don't say anything else.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.795
Sure, it wasn't.

01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:04.665
And it was a telemarketer
called you from the pay phone

01:10:04.666 --> 01:10:06.933
who stopped at the Chevron
to make a late-night sale.

01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:09.268
- That picture was some bullshit.
- Jimmy, stop.

01:10:09.269 --> 01:10:10.538
Detective, what's going on?

01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:15.541
Well, tell him.
Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him.

01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:17.944
See how your boss
will like this one.

01:10:17.945 --> 01:10:19.615
<i>( buzzing )</i>

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:23.752
Last chance.

01:10:24.752 --> 01:10:26.833
Wait here.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:14.568
Mr. Miller?

01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:16.937
I would like to introduce
you to Julie's mom.

01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:18.909
Sandrine.

01:11:21.909 --> 01:11:24.545
I'm so, so sorry.

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.881
I want to thank you for everything
you did for my daughter.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.681
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:11:28.682 --> 01:11:31.417
You believed in her.
You gave her a chance.

01:11:31.418 --> 01:11:33.390
She was happy.
I know she was happy.

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:38.634
It's not fair, is it? Not fair.

01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:48.983
It shouldn't have happened.

01:12:01.983 --> 01:12:04.718
...rail thin. She's a blonde.

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:06.754
I would have known who she was

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.722
if she didn't come up and
introduce herself to me.

01:12:08.723 --> 01:12:11.392
<i>- She looked totally different.
- ( beeping )</i>

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.131
She's living in Miami and...

01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:18.830
You're going straight
to level six?

01:12:18.831 --> 01:12:20.935
Don't you think you better pace
yourself a little bit?

01:12:21.935 --> 01:12:23.407
I'm good. I want to run.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.674
<i>Something the matter?</i>

01:12:27.675 --> 01:12:30.443
<i>You and Tom all right?</i>

01:12:30.444 --> 01:12:32.746
We're fine.

01:12:32.747 --> 01:12:34.850
You worried about
the deal closing?

01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:39.555
- No.
- Do you want me to guess?

01:12:40.555 --> 01:12:42.589
Come on, Brooke.
Don't be silly.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.559
- Tell me what's going on.
- You know, I can't stay for breakfast today.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.131
I have to just-- I got to get into work.
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:53.002
Did you finish the deal
with the hospital?

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:56.969
Uh, no.

01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:01.442
- Did he write the check?
- No.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:05.845
- Why not?
- Issues related to the closing.

01:13:05.846 --> 01:13:08.948
<i>- We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
- I'm not lying to you.</i>

01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:11.488
It's complicated.
You wouldn't understand.

01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:15.922
You know, I know that the--

01:13:15.923 --> 01:13:19.492
that the police
came to the office.

01:13:19.493 --> 01:13:21.127
Do you know what that's about?

01:13:21.128 --> 01:13:25.232
- I honestly have no idea.
- How about your father's head?

01:13:25.233 --> 01:13:27.233
Where he cut his head

01:13:27.234 --> 01:13:29.136
and the pain that he's
hiding in his stomach

01:13:29.137 --> 01:13:31.971
and the fact
that he hasn't slept?

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.007
And now, for some reason,

01:13:34.007 --> 01:13:38.178
it's way too complicated
for me to understand?

01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:42.081
There's no money
for a routine gift?

01:13:42.082 --> 01:13:43.951
Does that seem
a little strange?

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:47.120
- Of course it's strange.
- So tell me what's happening.

01:13:47.121 --> 01:13:49.956
What do you want me to say?

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:52.693
He's my dad.

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.065
- I have to trust him.
- No.

01:13:58.065 --> 01:14:00.099
You have to do
what's right for you.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.769
Not him. Not me. Not anyone.

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.914
This is your life.

01:14:13.914 --> 01:14:16.738
I love you. I've got to go.

01:14:37.738 --> 01:14:39.605
Mr. Mayfield.

01:14:39.606 --> 01:14:41.908
You keep sending people
to my office

01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:45.144
- to do business.
- They're just getting acquainted.

01:14:45.145 --> 01:14:47.915
Yeah. The intricacies
of my operation,

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.250
so that you cannot buy it?

01:14:50.251 --> 01:14:52.085
Just coffee, thanks.

01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:53.988
You remember what it was like
on our side of the fence.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:56.857
Everything just moves
a little slower.

01:14:56.858 --> 01:15:00.294
Plus, this whole audit mess doesn't help.
You know, clearing that all up.

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.295
- Fuck you.
- Excuse me?

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:05.165
Fuck you. I am the oracle
of Gracie Square.

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:07.200
You came to me.
I did not come to you.

01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:09.837
- Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot.
- No, no, no. Forget it.

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.339
Forget the deal. I don't
even care about the deal.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.907
No, I run a very comfortable--
no, excuse me.

01:15:14.908 --> 01:15:17.611
I run a thriving business.

01:15:17.612 --> 01:15:20.613
It has returned,
year to date, 15.4%.

01:15:20.614 --> 01:15:23.716
Approximately $583 million
from an operation

01:15:23.717 --> 01:15:26.086
that you don't have
and we both know you need.

01:15:26.087 --> 01:15:28.154
Which is why you called me
in the first place.

01:15:28.155 --> 01:15:30.756
You, on the other hand,
you take a salary

01:15:30.757 --> 01:15:33.859
of $18 million.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.329
And what are you doing with it?

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:38.130
Falling stock price--
no, negative 16?

01:15:38.131 --> 01:15:39.399
Is that what it is?

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.836
You've also lost approximately
3.5 billion to your investors.

01:15:43.837 --> 01:15:45.338
Tell me, why the fuck
do I need you?

01:15:45.339 --> 01:15:47.108
- Let's just calm down.
- You know what we're gonna do?

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.910
We're gonna put out a press
release. Immediately. Today.

01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:52.612
We're gonna say there's no deal.
There never was a deal.

01:15:52.613 --> 01:15:54.880
You're not going to be
buying Old Hill.

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:56.616
You're not going to be
buying Quantum.

01:15:56.617 --> 01:15:57.918
You're not going to be
buying anything.

01:15:57.919 --> 01:16:01.755
You? You're just a browser.

01:16:01.756 --> 01:16:05.091
Me? I'm going to continue
to enjoy my earnings.

01:16:05.092 --> 01:16:09.196
And while I soar
on princely wings

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:12.799
to my next winning enterprise,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.269
your shares are going to drop
another couple of bucks based on

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.738
a failed acquisition attempt.

01:16:18.739 --> 01:16:21.710
Bodes well for your tenure,
doesn't it?

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:24.015
Your price is too high.

01:16:28.015 --> 01:16:30.716
You have a nice day, James.

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:33.086
<i>400.</i>

01:16:33.087 --> 01:16:35.356
- 550.
- 450.

01:16:36.356 --> 01:16:37.856
525. That's it. Yes or no.

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:42.429
And if it's no, that's any
further communications

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.068
- goes right into my trash can.
- It's a deal.

01:16:47.068 --> 01:16:48.774
One other thing.

01:16:53.774 --> 01:16:56.443
Six months, I'm going to be gone.
I'm out of here.

01:16:56.444 --> 01:16:58.179
My daughter's
going to take it over.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.880
You know her, you trust her.

01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:04.283
- All right.
- And you're going to have to make my son a VP.

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:06.853
- Robert.
- No, no. He doesn't have to do anything.

01:17:06.854 --> 01:17:09.889
He just gets a salary.
He gets the office.

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:13.426
Five-year employment contract
for both of them.

01:17:13.427 --> 01:17:15.230
My lawyers draft them.
Yes or no?

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:19.109
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:17:28.109 --> 01:17:31.344
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing the deal.

01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:34.051
- You're not serious.
- Yeah. I'm serious. Very serious.

01:17:37.051 --> 01:17:38.059
Sign it.

01:17:45.059 --> 01:17:47.364
I'll send over a draft
of the press release.

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:53.032
- ( grunts )
- You all right?

01:17:53.033 --> 01:17:54.104
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

01:17:56.104 --> 01:18:01.110
Before I leave,
what would you have paid?

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:05.814
600. And you would have taken?

01:18:07.814 --> 01:18:10.183
475.

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:12.059
- So we made a good deal.
- Yeah.

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:21.802
Actually, I lied.
I would have taken 400.

01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.971
<i>Robert: Anyway, I will
be seeing most of you</i>

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:33.038
<i>at the gala tomorrow night.</i>

01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:34.974
Since the sale is official,

01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:37.043
as of this afternoon, you're
free to talk about it now.

01:18:37.044 --> 01:18:40.045
- More questions?
- Will we get new business cards?

01:18:40.046 --> 01:18:42.482
Yes. Everyone but you.

01:18:42.483 --> 01:18:44.785
All right. Thank you
all very, very much.

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:47.453
You're going to be proud
of this. It's a good day.

01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:49.089
Your hard work made it happen.

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:50.859
Thank you all. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:18:51.859 --> 01:18:53.394
So how did you get Mayfield
to come around?

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.795
I met his price.
Took it out of your share.

01:18:55.796 --> 01:18:57.563
- Hey, Robert?
- Yeah?

01:18:57.564 --> 01:19:01.067
- Nice job.
- Well, thank you.

01:19:01.068 --> 01:19:03.870
Now go get me that fucking
hospital check.

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:05.507
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

01:19:07.507 --> 01:19:10.387
<i>- Yeah?
- Felder: It's not good.</i>

01:19:20.387 --> 01:19:22.993
<i>( lights buzzing )</i>

01:19:25.993 --> 01:19:27.935
<i>( chatter )</i>

<i>( door buzzing )</i>

01:19:40.574 --> 01:19:42.452
Hello.

01:19:51.452 --> 01:19:53.420
You want something to drink?

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.589
- What do you got?
- Not much.

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.624
- Got any milk?
- Nope.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:19:59.231
I'll take a water.

01:20:04.231 --> 01:20:06.966
<i>- Where are you going?
- What?</i>

01:20:06.967 --> 01:20:11.506
- Boxes.
- Was planning on Virginia.

01:20:12.506 --> 01:20:14.948
Looks like
I'm not going anymore.

01:20:20.948 --> 01:20:22.617
What? You waiting on me
to say something?

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:26.452
- I told you not to take the toll.
- Yeah, you did.

01:20:26.453 --> 01:20:28.388
I said listen carefully.

01:20:28.389 --> 01:20:31.892
Follow my directions. Do
exactly what I tell you to do.

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.491
- You said all that.
- But you took the toll anyway.

01:20:33.492 --> 01:20:35.328
- No, I did not.
- Don't fucking lie to me.

01:20:35.329 --> 01:20:38.264
I'm not lying. I took 95
the whole goddamn way there.

01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:40.432
I did what you said. I didn't stop.
I didn't take the Triborough.

01:20:40.433 --> 01:20:41.799
I followed all
your fucking instructions.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.204
- Then where did they get the photograph from?
- You tell me.

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:48.073
- You're saying it's a fake?
- How did you get so fucking rich again?

01:20:48.074 --> 01:20:50.644
- Don't be such a wise-ass.
- This is my fucking life, man.

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:54.480
Earl's telling me it could be
10 years! 10 fucking years!

01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:57.517
How much is
10 years worth, Robert?

01:20:57.518 --> 01:20:59.619
<i>Look, man. I told you,
I ain't no fucking snitch.</i>

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.988
But this is bad.
This is real bad.

01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:04.523
Me and Reina got a whole plan

01:21:04.524 --> 01:21:06.226
<i>we about to make
happen next week.</i>

01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:08.428
- What plan?
- I got money saved up.

01:21:08.429 --> 01:21:10.533
Buying a business.

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:14.600
- What business?
- I bought an Applebee's.

01:21:14.601 --> 01:21:18.237
- What's an Applebee's?
- It's a fucking restaurant.

01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:22.207
- It's a chain restaurant.
- You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:24.978
Is this really what you
came here to talk about?

01:21:24.979 --> 01:21:29.416
- What are you gonna do?
- It's not really that simple, Jimmy.

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:32.652
- I'm in a situation now.
- What situation?

01:21:32.653 --> 01:21:35.154
I told you. Right now,

01:21:35.155 --> 01:21:37.390
if I were to speak, a lot
of people would get hurt.

01:21:37.391 --> 01:21:39.526
Jobs. Families.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:42.161
<i>A lot of innocent people. Do you
think you can understand that?</i>

01:21:42.162 --> 01:21:46.599
Yeah, but what about me?
What about my situation?

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.301
They showed me the pictures.
That's fucked up what you did.

01:21:49.302 --> 01:21:52.204
- And I know all the people counting on you. Whatever.
- It was an accident.

01:21:52.205 --> 01:21:54.143
But you told me Earl
was gonna make this right.

01:21:56.143 --> 01:21:58.045
<i>Robert, you know
I care about you.</i>

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:02.415
All the things you did
for us and for my father.

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:05.184
But Earl said
they'll offer me a deal.

01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:07.521
<i>No charges at all. I walk away.</i>

01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:11.758
They just want to know
who I went to pick up.

01:22:11.759 --> 01:22:14.626
Why are you putting me
in this situation, man?

01:22:14.627 --> 01:22:16.233
Why are you putting me
in this position?

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:21.367
Can you just hang tight?

01:22:21.368 --> 01:22:24.373
Can you do that?
Just a little longer.

01:22:26.373 --> 01:22:28.241
All right,

01:22:28.242 --> 01:22:30.777
but Earl said the deal
is on the table for 24 hours.

01:22:30.778 --> 01:22:34.181
<i>After that,
they're going to file a case.</i>

01:22:35.181 --> 01:22:36.020
Earl says we're going to lose.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.490
All right.

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:45.773
Just hang with me a little bit.

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:01.107
You got to give him up.

01:23:01.108 --> 01:23:03.309
You said take the money.

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:06.082
Yeah. That was to keep quiet,
not to go away.

01:23:08.082 --> 01:23:09.652
<i>What's he offering you now?</i>

01:23:11.652 --> 01:23:13.640
What can he offer me?

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.507
<i>Felder:
We went to the toll authority</i>

01:23:35.508 --> 01:23:37.778
<i>and they said they gave
the tape to the cops.</i>

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:41.613
<i>I requested our investigator go
examine it at the evidence room,</i>

01:23:41.614 --> 01:23:43.649
<i>but honestly, what's the point?</i>

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:47.460
<i>- He says he didn't take the toll.
- And you believe him?</i>

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.728
<i>- Does Standard have claw-back?
- What? What do you mean?</i>

01:23:56.729 --> 01:23:59.532
<i>- Let's just say I decide to go in.
- Have you lost your mind?</i>

01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:01.137
Wait a minute.
Just listen. Listen to me.

01:24:04.137 --> 01:24:06.706
If I were to surrender now...

01:24:06.707 --> 01:24:10.309
<i>- could they roll back the deal?
- No. What's done is done.</i>

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:14.279
<i>There's no intention of fraud, you
haven't warranted any behavior.</i>

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.383
<i>- So it's just money.
- Four years, you think?</i>

01:24:17.384 --> 01:24:19.251
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:24:19.252 --> 01:24:23.255
<i>At this point, they're not
going to make it easy.</i>

01:24:23.256 --> 01:24:27.794
<i>I really suggest
you think about this.</i>

01:24:27.795 --> 01:24:30.568
Call the D.A. Get it started.

01:24:34.568 --> 01:24:37.840
<i>Robert: Yeah, Glen. Mrs. Miller
say where she was going tonight?</i>

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.854
Ah. No, I'll try her
her cell. Thank you.

01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:56.922
( phone ringing )

01:24:56.923 --> 01:24:59.434
<i>Voicemail: Hi, this is Ellen Miller.
I'm not available right now.</i>

01:25:07.434 --> 01:25:09.585
( groans )

01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:28.554
Syd? Yeah, yeah. Did you make
that call to the D.A. yet?

01:25:28.555 --> 01:25:31.523
Thank God. No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:31.524 --> 01:25:33.626
Listen to me. Call Earl.

01:25:33.627 --> 01:25:35.428
<i>Tell him to get his car.</i>

01:25:35.429 --> 01:25:38.965
<i>Tell him to meet us over here
at my house in 20 minutes.</i>

01:25:38.966 --> 01:25:42.801
<i>Yeah, and Syd? Bring a notary.</i>

01:25:42.802 --> 01:25:44.712
I'm going to need
a receipt, please.

01:25:51.712 --> 01:25:53.840
Thank you.
You have a good night now.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.442
Hi. I'm Brent Owens. Night Supervisor.
How can I help you?

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.277
Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe.

01:26:24.278 --> 01:26:26.446
I'm issuing
a criminal evidence request.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:29.749
I'm going to need to have a
look at one of your lane tapes.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:32.417
I don't understand.
This says you want to look

01:26:32.418 --> 01:26:34.418
at a tape that was made
ten minutes ago?

01:26:40.027 --> 01:26:42.400
Wait, wait. Just wait.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.006
<i>( knocks on window )</i>

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:55.642
Okay. They won't release
tape without a court order,

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.977
<i>but they did give me
a printout.</i>

01:26:57.978 --> 01:27:01.813
The same kind they used
at Jimmy's indictment.

01:27:01.814 --> 01:27:03.950
- Your car? With plates.
- Yes.

01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:05.587
Okay. You got Jimmy's?

01:27:07.587 --> 01:27:09.623
Thanks.

01:27:43.623 --> 01:27:45.728
<i>- Son of a bitch.
- ( laughing )</i>

01:27:47.728 --> 01:27:49.496
<i>Man: They look a little
different to me, too.</i>

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.730
Is there a reason
why you haven't allowed

01:27:51.731 --> 01:27:54.066
Mr. Monroe's investigator
to conduct his own analysis?

01:27:54.067 --> 01:27:55.802
We've had some issues
regarding chain of custody.

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.937
Now you don't
have them anymore.

01:27:57.938 --> 01:28:00.439
You're to meet with him, with
the evidence, in the next hour.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.377
I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:28:03.377 --> 01:28:05.577
Where is the tape?

01:28:05.578 --> 01:28:07.079
<i>Am I not speaking loud enough?</i>

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.546
<i>- Your Honor?
- Yes?</i>

01:28:08.547 --> 01:28:10.086
- There seems to be--
- Let him tell me.

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:15.822
- We don't know where it is.
- Come again?

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:19.425
- It's not in the evidence locker.
- Where is it?

01:28:19.426 --> 01:28:22.862
- We don't know.
- I'll ask you one more time, Detective.

01:28:22.863 --> 01:28:25.502
Where is the tape?

01:28:28.502 --> 01:28:31.108
<i>- We lost it.
- Monroe: Mm.</i>

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.009
In light of these developments--

01:28:36.009 --> 01:28:37.845
and I would think you should be
very happy to hear this.

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:40.947
With Mr. Monroe's approval, I'm
going to offer Mr. Deferlito

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:44.050
<i>the opportunity to voluntarily
dismiss the indictment</i>

01:28:44.051 --> 01:28:46.118
<i>to save us all a bunch
of embarrassment.</i>

01:28:46.119 --> 01:28:48.988
- I don't feel comfortable with that, Your Honor.
- Further, I'm going to put

01:28:48.989 --> 01:28:51.556
all charges against
Mr. Grant under seal.

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:54.426
This case is dismissed with
prejudice and not to be refiled.

01:28:54.427 --> 01:28:56.929
<i>Hold on, Detective.</i>

01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:59.898
<i>If you have another suspect
in the automobile death,</i>

01:28:59.899 --> 01:29:03.836
then you are to present him.

01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:06.006
But Mr. Grant is free
from any further inquiry.

01:29:07.006 --> 01:29:10.881
<i>- This is over. Do I have your understanding?
- Thank you.</i>

01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:17.591
Close the door,
Detective. Please.

01:29:24.591 --> 01:29:26.858
You finessed this. Didn't you?

01:29:26.859 --> 01:29:30.429
- I'm sorry?
- You finessed it.

01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:32.431
I know it and you know it.

01:29:32.432 --> 01:29:34.099
<i>I know who you're after.</i>

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.702
<i>I saw all the evidence.
Not just a toll photo.</i>

01:29:36.703 --> 01:29:40.707
- You got to get him the right way.
- Oh.

01:29:41.707 --> 01:29:42.612
Okay.

01:29:45.612 --> 01:29:48.147
So let me get this straight.

01:29:48.148 --> 01:29:50.751
What you're telling me is I'm supposed
to sit around with my thumb up my ass

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:53.685
and my fingers crossed,
hoping that one of these

01:29:53.686 --> 01:29:55.189
fucking days,
somewhere down the line,

01:29:55.190 --> 01:29:57.989
one of these rich assholes

01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:01.059
is gonna say the wrong thing
loud enough

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.600
so that we can't choose
to ignore him anymore?

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.604
Get the fuck out of my office.

01:30:10.604 --> 01:30:13.975
Yes, Your Honor.

01:30:14.975 --> 01:30:18.176
- Well, when do you expect her?
- Hey.

01:30:18.177 --> 01:30:21.246
- When do you expect her?
- What's going on?

01:30:21.247 --> 01:30:23.616
So I don't have
to call you a ninth time,

01:30:23.617 --> 01:30:25.185
can you take down
what I'm saying?

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:27.953
Word for word. Exactly.

01:30:27.954 --> 01:30:29.956
Okay. You got a pencil?

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.191
All right. Are you ready?

01:30:32.192 --> 01:30:34.126
Okay. Here goes.

01:30:34.127 --> 01:30:35.894
Mrs. Miller,

01:30:35.895 --> 01:30:39.002
exactly how fucking stupid
do you really think I am?

01:30:43.002 --> 01:30:45.571
He didn't hurt anybody.

01:30:45.572 --> 01:30:47.739
He helped a lot of people.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:50.613
- This piece of paper makes everything okay?
- No.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.547
It makes it easier.

01:30:55.548 --> 01:30:57.118
You heard him say something.

01:30:59.118 --> 01:31:00.622
No.

01:31:02.622 --> 01:31:06.725
Robert, look. You asked me to
come meet you and I'm here.

01:31:06.726 --> 01:31:10.630
But I came because I want to get
something straight between us.

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:12.600
We're even.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.903
Okay. We're even.

01:31:17.904 --> 01:31:21.107
Just for the record, though,

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.276
what you did,

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:25.877
way beyond the money.

01:31:25.878 --> 01:31:28.648
Nothing beyond money for you, Robert.
We both know that.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:32.087
- Thanks a lot.
- If I take this...

01:31:34.087 --> 01:31:36.127
what does that say about me?

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:43.129
Fuck it. I'm going
to take your money.

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.877
I'm going to do
something good with it.

01:31:57.877 --> 01:31:59.181
Hey, sweetie.

01:32:02.181 --> 01:32:04.282
What time do you
want to get there?

01:32:04.283 --> 01:32:06.722
<i>I don't want
to get there too soon.</i>

01:32:09.722 --> 01:32:12.927
<i>How late do you
think it will go?</i>

01:32:14.927 --> 01:32:17.699
You okay? What is it?

01:32:19.699 --> 01:32:23.234
- You spoke to Brooke?
- She told you that?

01:32:23.235 --> 01:32:27.842
- No, she didn't have to.
- ( sighs )

01:32:29.842 --> 01:32:33.245
- Yeah, I explained to Brooke--
- You explained?

01:32:33.246 --> 01:32:37.849
- Did you tell her everything?
- Yeah. Yes.

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.890
Everything?

01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:47.059
- Lift up your shirt.
- What?

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:49.702
<i>Lift up your shirt.</i>

01:32:55.702 --> 01:32:57.947
Did you tell her about this?

01:33:06.947 --> 01:33:09.914
- Ellen, I don't know what you think you know.
- Don't treat me like an idiot.

01:33:09.915 --> 01:33:12.351
You've been sneaking off to see her for months.
You don't think I know?

01:33:12.352 --> 01:33:16.889
- What do you think you know?
- I never cared, really, about your secretaries,

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:19.791
<i>your gallerists, your whores,
whatever you want to call them.</i>

01:33:19.792 --> 01:33:21.794
<i>I cared about our home.</i>

01:33:21.795 --> 01:33:25.864
- Now you brought this to our door.
- I did what was necessary.

01:33:25.865 --> 01:33:27.900
No, you did what was necessary for
you, Robert, for your interests.

01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:29.434
<i>- For my interests?
- Yes.</i>

01:33:29.435 --> 01:33:32.438
Everything I do is for us.
For this family.

01:33:32.439 --> 01:33:35.808
- Now you're telling me how to run my business?
- This isn't about business!

01:33:35.809 --> 01:33:38.244
This is our life! Where do you
think we're going tonight?

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.979
What do you think I've tolerated
all of this for so long?

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:44.050
You tolerated? Wow.

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.918
- I'm glad you find that funny.
- What about me?

01:33:45.919 --> 01:33:48.153
What about me?
What about the complaints?

01:33:48.154 --> 01:33:50.922
The unhappiness? The drinking?

01:33:50.923 --> 01:33:54.393
The shopping?
The trainers? Everything!

01:33:54.394 --> 01:33:57.862
But, yes, the charities. The
wonderful, sainted charities.

01:33:57.863 --> 01:34:00.800
You know, all the wonderful
things that you do.

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.468
How do you think
I pay for them?

01:34:02.469 --> 01:34:06.171
I didn't ask you because
I didn't want you to lie.

01:34:06.172 --> 01:34:07.007
- Because you didn't want to give them up.
- I thought that we

01:34:08.007 --> 01:34:11.443
had an understanding, and you
broke that understanding

01:34:11.444 --> 01:34:13.144
when you brought
Brooke into it.

01:34:13.145 --> 01:34:16.181
- No, I kept her out.
- When you made Brooke complicit.

01:34:16.182 --> 01:34:19.787
- When you risked her future, and I'm done.
- I kept her out.

01:34:20.787 --> 01:34:22.011
- What is this?
- Read it.

01:34:46.011 --> 01:34:48.147
All ownership
and voting rights transfer

01:34:48.148 --> 01:34:50.048
to the Miller Charitable
Foundation

01:34:50.049 --> 01:34:51.287
to be administered
by Brooke Miller.

01:34:54.287 --> 01:34:57.857
- You really expect me to sign this thing?
- You're not following.

01:34:57.858 --> 01:35:01.160
- Apparently not. No, no.
- Okay.

01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:04.964
Um, the police have been
trying to talk to me.

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:08.399
I assume because they want to
know where you were that night.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.769
I'm not going to lie for you.

01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:13.938
- Not unless you sign that.
- Yeah.

01:35:13.939 --> 01:35:15.840
This leaves me with nothing.

01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:17.144
I think you'll
find a way to manage.

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:21.147
I'm sure you have all kinds of
things offshore for a rainy day.

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:24.018
- This is fucking crazy.
- If you sign it, then I will tell your lie.

01:35:25.018 --> 01:35:30.523
I will say that I was with you
that night. All night, here.

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:34.160
<i>And you will be free and clear.</i>

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:37.565
And the people that need our money will get it.
That's my price.

01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:41.467
You are out of your mind.
I am not signing this.

01:35:41.468 --> 01:35:43.005
I will not sign that!

01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:47.505
Well, then,
I will have to tell them

01:35:47.506 --> 01:35:50.442
that you came home at 4:30...

01:35:50.443 --> 01:35:52.212
- bruised and bleeding.
- Why would you tell them?

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:54.015
That's fucking ridiculous.
What--

01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:59.451
- You trying to blackmail me?
- I think we call it negotiating.

01:35:59.452 --> 01:36:02.188
You're not going to win that one.
There's no fucking way.

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.989
Then you know what? It will
cause just enough trouble,

01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:06.125
the kind of trouble
that you don't want.

01:36:06.126 --> 01:36:09.060
- Apparently, according to my lawyer, it's enough...
- Fucking lawyer--

01:36:09.061 --> 01:36:10.030
- ...to give them probable cause.
- Fuck!

01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:15.334
- Then they can subpoena your DNA and your cell phone and--
- Fuck the DNA!

01:36:15.335 --> 01:36:18.104
- I'm sick of this shit!
- So, really, Robert. What you have is a choice.

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:21.072
You can either be in court and the
tabloids for the next three years,

01:36:21.073 --> 01:36:23.142
or you can be at your business.

01:36:23.143 --> 01:36:25.215
You won't do this.
You won't do it.

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:32.425
- You wouldn't do it to the kids.
- Just try me.

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:41.327
You broke

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.367
our little girl's heart.

01:36:47.367 --> 01:36:50.269
It's how it all works, Ellen.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.103
- You know that.
- I know.

01:36:52.104 --> 01:36:55.377
- But she didn't.
- She'll be better for it.

01:36:57.377 --> 01:37:00.511
The world is cold.

01:37:00.512 --> 01:37:02.020
Then you're going
to need a warm coat.

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.002
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:24.470
There's one more thing.
I hate to mention it now...

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:28.311
- but I just received it.
- Speak, John.

01:37:32.311 --> 01:37:36.482
I had Stern Marling do a secondary
audit on the Miller financials.

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:40.563
<i>- Who authorized this?
- I did.</i>

01:37:50.563 --> 01:37:53.000
What did you conclude?
It's in front of you.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.100
( chuckles )

01:37:56.101 --> 01:37:57.569
I didn't ask you
what the paper said, John.

01:37:57.570 --> 01:37:59.206
I asked you what you thought.

01:38:00.206 --> 01:38:02.407
What do you think?

01:38:02.408 --> 01:38:05.077
I think...

01:38:05.078 --> 01:38:07.257
I think I don't see
anything wrong here.

01:38:52.257 --> 01:38:54.661
<i>Brooke: And to receive
this prestigious award...</i>

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:56.495
<i>I invite now to the stage</i>

01:38:56.496 --> 01:38:59.364
<i>the man who led
this generous effort</i>

01:38:59.365 --> 01:39:02.634
<i>and whose financial
trading firm, Miller Capital,</i>

01:39:02.635 --> 01:39:06.673
<i>was just this morning acquired
by Standard Bank & Trust.</i>

01:39:07.673 --> 01:39:11.777
<i>A dedicated businessman,
a family man,</i>

01:39:11.778 --> 01:39:15.147
<i>philanthropist,</i>

01:39:15.148 --> 01:39:17.284
and all-around humanitarian.

01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:21.754
A man I am very lucky to call

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:25.491
my mentor, my friend,

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.660
<i>and my father.</i>

01:39:28.661 --> 01:39:31.793
<i>Mr. Robert Miller.</i>

01:40:34.793 --> 01:40:36.771
<i>( music playing )</i>

01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:48.342

<i># And when #</i>

<i># You get older later #</i>

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:26.577
<i># I will see the same girl #</i>

01:41:26.578 --> 01:41:30.883
<i># The same soul #</i>

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:36.354

01:41:36.355 --> 01:41:40.708
<i># Passionate lover #</i>

01:41:56.708 --> 01:42:00.585
<i># And afterwards #</i>

01:42:05.585 --> 01:42:09.827
<i># Later this century #</i>

01:42:14.827 --> 01:42:19.665
<i># When you and I #</i>

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:24.837
<i># Have become corpses #</i>

01:42:25.837 --> 01:42:30.341
