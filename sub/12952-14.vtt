00:00.934 --> 00:01.800
<i>Previously on "Alias:"</i>

00:01.801 --> 00:04.103
Something you should know.

00:04.104 --> 00:09.041
I spent three years studying you
for my postdoctorate dissertation.

00:09.109 --> 00:13.773
And to some degree
I understand you, Arvin.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.611
And I can help you if you let me try.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.744
I lie. I keep secrets.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.257
I divulge only what I must
in order to elicit the reaction I need.

00:25.325 --> 00:30.786
One of those secrets affects the
only two people I care about in the world.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.364
Sydney and Jack Bristow.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.058
This watch belonged to my father.

00:37.137 --> 00:40.504
It's broken now,
but it used to keep perfect time.

00:40.573 --> 00:44.236
He said,"You could set your heart
by this watch. "

00:45.178 --> 00:50.673
It stopped October 1, the day we met.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.420
We will find each other.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.515
We always find each other.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:11.604 --> 01:13.238
You two are gonna
continue working together.

01:13.239 --> 01:17.073
You're gonna be heading up
our new North American cell.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.778
That sounds just about right.

01:21.714 --> 01:26.617
Now, of course, this doesn't absolve you
of your responsibilities.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.416
Working overtime
as an agent for Uncle Sam.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.156
Of course.

01:31.157 --> 01:35.218
But in the meantime, may I suggest -
and this is just a suggestion -

01:35.295 --> 01:41.359
that you put the kibosh on
your husband's extracurricular sextivities?

01:44.704 --> 01:45.938
Lauren. Hi.

01:45.939 --> 01:50.467
I see what's going on between
you and Michael, so let me be clear.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.774
Stay the hell away from my husband.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.930
Michael, what are you doing?

02:14.567 --> 02:17.627
<i>Sometimes I hate my job.</i>

02:21.875 --> 02:24.375
Baby, what's going on?

02:25.411 --> 02:28.005
You know how doctors
always make you wait?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.681
What?

02:29.682 --> 02:33.641
When you go in for an appointment.
My dad hated that.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.553
He used to say
he always kept his appointments

02:37.624 --> 02:40.124
and everyone else
should do the same.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.594
<i>Are you OK?</i>

02:42.595 --> 02:45.189
Yeah.

02:45.265 --> 02:49.759
I just... I was looking for my house keys
and I found this.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.703
Why were you looking
for your house keys?

02:55.708 --> 02:59.371
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd go for a jog.

02:59.445 --> 03:01.945
What time is it?

03:03.550 --> 03:06.144
I dunno. It's broken.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.655
Are you sure you're all right?

03:16.129 --> 03:18.629
Yeah. I'm fine.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.506
I'll see you later.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.085
<i>Will he ever open his eyes?</i>

03:40.086 --> 03:42.354
Well, babies sleep, Weiss,
that's what they do, you know?

03:42.355 --> 03:45.620
Except when they're screaming.
Last night from midnight to six.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.593
- He's gorgeous, Marshall.
- Thanks.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.119
- Isn't he beautiful?
- Mm.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.531
Looks like he has my nose.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.766
<i>- Oh, look at him.
- Thanks.</i>

03:54.767 --> 03:57.267
You know, last night he looked at me.
He barely opened his eyes,

03:57.337 --> 04:01.398
but... I swear to God, guys,
Mitchell's a genius.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.308
Oh, Mr. Bristow.

04:03.309 --> 04:06.244
Take a look.
It's Mitchell. He's my guy.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.847
- Cute.
- Thanks.

04:11.584 --> 04:16.180
- Your tie's on backwards.
- Oh, I didn't... get a lot of sleep.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.724
You're familiar with the Shining Sword?

04:18.725 --> 04:21.026
Fundamentalist terror network
based in the Philippines?

04:21.027 --> 04:23.028
They've been dormant
since the Bali bombings of '02.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.229
Are they operational again?

04:24.230 --> 04:26.824
Earlier today we intercepted
a burst transmission

04:26.899 --> 04:29.800
which indicates
that an operative of Shining Sword

04:29.869 --> 04:31.436
has acquired a plasma charge.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.634
Plasma charge?
I thought those were only theoretical.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.375
According to the burst transmission,

04:36.376 --> 04:40.369
the operative is shipping the bomb
to one of their European cells.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.074
The transmission included specs.
Now, believe it or not,

04:43.149 --> 04:45.484
these schematics are two times scale,

04:45.485 --> 04:50.320
meaning this device is only six inches
in diameter. But... it packs a wallop.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.156
Now, this is a conservative interpolation
of the damage it would cause if detonated,

04:54.227 --> 04:57.754
and this doesn't account for fires
or collateral explosions.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.298
And...

04:59.299 --> 05:02.962
Sorry. Dunno how that got in there.
That was at breakfast... Mitchell.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.630
Is the bomb being shipped transpacific
or via the Atlantic?

05:05.705 --> 05:07.572
We don't know,
but we traced the transmission

05:07.573 --> 05:09.808
to a digital storage facility in Vancouver

05:09.809 --> 05:12.277
where the Shining Sword operative
maintains his database.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.345
Were we able to hack in?

05:13.346 --> 05:17.680
Well, DigiStash is basically
a self-storage facility for digital files -

05:17.750 --> 05:19.818
corporate records, medical databases,
that sort of stuff -

05:19.819 --> 05:21.586
so their firewall's state of the art.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.422
I wouldn't be able to hack the database

05:23.423 --> 05:27.086
unless someone on the inside
were to open up a port.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.221
Sydney, Vaughn. You'll go to the facility
looking to lease vault space.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.398
Once inside you'll uplink with Marshall.

05:33.399 --> 05:37.062
Now, if we're lucky, the operative will
have archived the details of the shipment

05:37.136 --> 05:39.866
and we can intercept the bomb
before it's delivered.

05:39.939 --> 05:43.534
Shall I tell them the idea I had?
I had a great idea what you guys should...

05:43.609 --> 05:47.010
I think you should pose
as radio astronomers.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.413
You know, looking to back up
your recordings of interplanetary noise.

05:50.483 --> 05:54.476
Now, I came up with a little cheat sheet
that should help you,

05:54.554 --> 05:57.990
and you can review this en route.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.324
<i>And one more thing.</i>

05:59.325 --> 06:02.021
The Covenant may have intercepted
CIA intelligence

06:02.095 --> 06:06.555
regarding our mission in North Korea
and our pursuit of the Doleac agenda.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.867
Langley has assigned
a counterintelligence team

06:08.868 --> 06:14.306
to determine whether someone within
the agency has been leaking information.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.605
Jack will run point on their investigation
inside this office.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.578
Marshall, Lauren, I've scheduled you
in the first round of interviews.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.414
You'll be available later this afternoon?

06:22.415 --> 06:25.043
Actually, I'm due in DC tonight
for an NSC briefing,

06:25.118 --> 06:26.918
but I'll call them
and let them know I can't make it.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.047
That's OK. As soon as you return, then.
Weiss, you'll go instead.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.623
Good. Let's get moving.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.392
Lauren, we need to talk.

06:37.163 --> 06:37.829
Lauren?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.330
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.235
Hey, guess what? It's me.
Come on. How you doing?

06:44.871 --> 06:47.038
I'm hanging in there.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.974
How was Lauren about it?

06:52.645 --> 06:56.809
- She didn't remember.
- And you didn't say anything?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.186
Nah. I mean, she's got a lot on her mind.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.916
Yeah, that's probably it.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.832
<i>- Hello?
- Uh, Dr. Barnett, this is Arvin Sloane.</i>

07:25.378 --> 07:30.008
I'm calling to apologize for my discourteous
behavior the other day when we met.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.483
I'm not accustomed to just
simply sitting around and talking.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.181
- Well, not everyone is.
- Yeah.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.056
Actually, it would have been
much more simple

07:38.057 --> 07:41.083
if there had been a bottle
of ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion on the table.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.327
Excuse me?

07:42.328 --> 07:48.289
<i>I'm suggesting that we talk over dinner.
You know? "In vino veritas"?</i>

07:48.367 --> 07:50.535
I know a lovely little
out-of-the-way restaurant

07:50.536 --> 07:52.170
in a former sewing machine factory.

07:52.171 --> 07:57.074
It's called Brasserie Al Pontile.
I'm hoping you enjoy French cuisine.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.578
Well, that wouldn't be very professional.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.639
Well, why don't you consider it
an office with food?

08:02.715 --> 08:06.310
After all, psychoanalysts do eat dinner,
don't they?

08:06.385 --> 08:10.617
<i>Zurich is such a lovely city.
It would be criminal for you to dine alone.</i>

08:10.690 --> 08:13.818
At any rate, you know the name of the
restaurant. I shall be there at eight o'clock

08:13.893 --> 08:16.828
and I am hoping you'll join me.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.730
<i>Goodbye, Dr. Barnett.</i>

08:32.111 --> 08:35.376
So you're looking for alien life?

08:35.448 --> 08:38.110
In a manner of speaking.
Our radio telescopes inspect the cosmos,

08:38.183 --> 08:42.280
looking to detect artificially generated
signals. Basically, anything below 300Hz.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.257
But don't worry. The alien invasion
is still a few months away.

08:46.325 --> 08:47.592
As we discussed over the phone,

08:47.593 --> 08:51.085
our telescopes gather over 350 gigabytes
of information per day.

08:51.163 --> 08:54.098
Not a problem. Our vaults are designed
to accommodate teraflops.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.760
You could store 20 years of data
in the vault you've leased.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.430
Number 2289 please, Luc.

08:59.505 --> 09:02.770
Data is backed up twice daily. The servers
are monitored around the clock.

09:02.842 --> 09:06.141
Climate control, fire suppression,
all state of the art.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.840
- The interface is hot-swappable.
- Oh, great.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.249
If you need anything, you can call me.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.912
Thank you.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.893
Luc?

09:24.330 --> 09:28.198
<i>OK, guys. Let me know when
you're connected to the mainframe, OK?</i>

09:28.267 --> 09:30.767
<i>- Copy that.
- Mm-hm.</i>

09:32.772 --> 09:34.873
<i>OK, now, once we download
the shipping information</i>

09:34.874 --> 09:39.140
<i>we should be able to pinpoint
the location of the plasma charge.</i>

09:39.211 --> 09:41.012
Connection established.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.914
Oh, listen, I wanted to...
ask you something. The truth, now.

09:43.983 --> 09:47.851
Your science-geek character...
was that supposed to be me?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.055
<i>- Your son.
- Funny.</i>

09:50.056 --> 09:51.957
Although that would have been pretty cool,
don't you think?

09:51.958 --> 09:55.724
Little Mitchell working
side by side with his old man.

09:57.897 --> 10:02.163
<i>- We're downloading now.
- I see it. Another 15 seconds.</i>

10:05.037 --> 10:07.537
Marshall, what's happening?

10:09.008 --> 10:12.034
I don't know. There's someone else
in the system with you.

10:12.111 --> 10:12.978
Here, from our end?

10:12.979 --> 10:14.879
It has to be.
There's no other way to access the files.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.576
I think they just planted a virus.
It has to be the Covenant.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.346
The mole must have leaked our intel.
They beat us here.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.387
You guys, listen to me.
Disconnect from their system

10:22.388 --> 10:24.089
before their virus affects our copy.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.590
<i>- Did we get the shipping information?
- I'm not sure.</i>

10:25.591 --> 10:29.152
I'll have to see if I can reconstruct the data
from what we've got.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.728
Let's get out of here.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.631
Please. Don't do this.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.289
The shooter.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.293
There! Vaughn!

11:20.613 --> 11:23.113
The F-150.

12:34.553 --> 12:37.053
Vaughn!

13:18.497 --> 13:20.598
How much of the data
did we get our hands on?

13:20.599 --> 13:23.227
Looks like 63 percent,
give or take a few megs.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.802
Oh, I slept 20 minutes last night, FYI.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.405
<i>How long before
you can extrapolate the rest?</i>

13:27.406 --> 13:31.604
Well, I ran the code through a high-grade
decryption algebra... algorithms, I mean.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.908
Oh, but you should look at this,
stare at this, right here. It's like a lava lamp.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.609
- If you look... I passed out before when I...
- Marshall, how long?

13:38.684 --> 13:39.751
12 hours?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.949
We don't have 12 hours. If the Covenant
gets their hands on the plasma charge...

13:43.022 --> 13:45.356
Sydney. I know.

13:45.357 --> 13:50.488
The decryption program will work,
but it just requires a little time.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.465
I'm out of coffee. I had 12 cups
and I'm not feeling anything.

13:54.466 --> 13:58.960
You'd think it would... Caffeine...
I'm gonna check if it's the real deal.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.235
- Do you guys want?
- No, thank you.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.833
Oh, by the way, after six hours
in the hot seat

14:04.910 --> 14:07.078
from the boys from counterintelligence,

14:07.079 --> 14:09.741
Langley has declared me exhausted,
but free from suspicion.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.843
Never had a doubt in my mind.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.394
Is something wrong?

14:23.395 --> 14:28.958
- No. No. Just getting old, I guess.
- You expect me to believe that?

14:30.536 --> 14:33.801
Just had a lot on my mind lately,
that's all. It'll pass.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.770
Yesterday was the day,
wasn't it?

14:38.844 --> 14:41.438
The anniversary
of your father's death.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.046
How could you remember that?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.955
I remember what missing him
does to you.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.796
Sorry.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.404
Hey.

15:07.706 --> 15:08.940
<i>How was your day?</i>

15:08.941 --> 15:12.775
<i>- Oh, frustrating. Hit a bit of a roadblock.
- Anything I can help you with?</i>

15:12.845 --> 15:14.512
No, but thanks for asking.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.014
<i>Michael, would you mind
holding a second?</i>

15:16.015 --> 15:18.515
No, go ahead.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.111
<i>Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm being called away. I love you.</i>

15:22.187 --> 15:24.687
Uh, you too.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.246
Glad you came.

15:48.247 --> 15:53.116
So that we're clear, I'm here
for professional reasons only.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.086
Oh, we're clear.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.720
Although I must say
I don't necessarily believe you.

16:02.227 --> 16:05.526
Well, I told you that I was writing about you,

16:05.597 --> 16:08.293
but I haven't told you
the premise of my thesis.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.234
Aha. Well, I would say I'm fascinated,

16:10.235 --> 16:12.136
but that would sound egomaniacal,
wouldn't it?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.662
<i>Salud.</i>

16:14.740 --> 16:19.109
You certainly have given proof
that anyone can change for the better.

16:19.178 --> 16:22.079
Given the proper stimuli.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.310
You look beautiful. Beautiful.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.150
That's just a layman's opinion, Dr. Barnett.

16:31.256 --> 16:36.717
All I'm saying is that
you made a remarkable transformation.

16:36.795 --> 16:40.196
Master spy to humanitarian.

16:40.265 --> 16:41.799
Yeah.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.168
Well, sometimes I wonder which is harder.

16:44.169 --> 16:48.936
The Rambaldi device was instrumental
in your transformation.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.602
Oh, yes, it was critical.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.305
It only revealed one word to you.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.379
- "Peace. "
- That's correct.

16:58.450 --> 17:02.216
And yet there were eight yards
of parchment scroll

17:02.287 --> 17:04.787
before the message appeared.

17:05.723 --> 17:10.855
- Wh-what was on that?
- Oh. It was nothing. Blank paper.

17:10.929 --> 17:14.729
Sort of the equivalent of leader tape
on a cassette.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.326
I discarded it.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.998
I'm not quite sure why you did that.

17:23.075 --> 17:27.978
You could have studied it,
sold it, kept it for antiquity.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.515
It's hard to believe
that you threw away something

17:30.516 --> 17:33.974
that you would normally consider holy.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.349
Are you calling me a liar?

17:39.958 --> 17:44.122
You almost revealed something
to me the other day.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.063
A secret.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.795
That wears on you.
Those were your words.

17:54.139 --> 17:56.699
I am not your patient...

17:56.775 --> 17:58.409
your client...

17:58.410 --> 18:00.910
or your lab rat.

18:00.979 --> 18:04.278
Now, we can speak in generalities,

18:04.349 --> 18:08.649
have an elegant meal,
perhaps laugh together,

18:08.720 --> 18:14.249
but there are some truths
you will never learn from me.

18:14.326 --> 18:17.159
Do you understand that?

18:18.864 --> 18:25.428
You must be ravenous. I suggest the
Barbary duckling. It's their signature dish.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.170
This was a mistake. Sorry.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.085
Now, there are still several hundred
gigabytes to decipher,

18:41.086 --> 18:44.578
but I was at least able to decode this.

18:45.524 --> 18:49.551
Freighter. Liberian registry.
Will dock in Lisbon, 14 hours.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.961
- How do we locate the bomb?
- With this.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.834
It is a modified explosives sniffer.

18:56.835 --> 19:00.327
Now, I've added plasma to the list
of detectable compounds that it detects.

19:00.405 --> 19:03.135
You know, like Semtex,
dynamite, HMX, you know.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.200
It works just like
a normal tracking device.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.838
When you're within 100 feet,
"bling, bling, bling".

19:08.914 --> 19:11.439
- Found the prize in the Cracker Jack.
- 100 feet.

19:11.517 --> 19:16.511
Sorry, I would have done better
if I'd had a little more sleep.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.666
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.
We're on board.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.012
<i>We have you five-by,
Mountaineer.</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:45.109
Perimeter is clear. Now let's fire up
that sniffer and find the bomb, baby.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.919
- Hot or cold?
- Freezing.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.818
Wait, I think we've got something.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.391
Towards the stern, 30 yards below us.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.894
We've got tone below deck,
possibly the engine room.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.664
Copy that. Proceed.

20:10.008 --> 20:12.508
Mountaineer? Boy Scout? Report.

20:18.617 --> 20:22.144
<i>- Sydney, do you copy?
- Vaughn, are you OK?</i>

20:36.368 --> 20:38.868
Michael, what are you doing?

20:40.505 --> 20:43.497
<i>Sometimes I hate my job.</i>

20:46.511 --> 20:49.011
Baby, what's going on?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.710
I was looking for my house keys
and I found this.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.651
Why were you looking
for your house keys?

20:57.589 --> 21:01.252
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd go for a jog.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.826
What time is it?

21:05.430 --> 21:08.024
I dunno. It's broken.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.367
Are you sure you're all right?

21:13.438 --> 21:16.100
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.011
I'll see you later.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.863
- This better be good.
- And a good morning to you, too.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.138
<i>You paged me on my NSC cellphone.</i>

21:47.139 --> 21:49.273
You know that they track
all incoming numbers.

21:49.274 --> 21:52.971
This cellphone's been cloned,
so you have nothing to worry about.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.179
We've just learned that
a freelance munitions expert

21:55.180 --> 21:57.081
has created a cutting-edge technology.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.245
<i>One that he's since sold
to one of our rivals.</i>

22:00.319 --> 22:04.255
We need you to filter back any CIA intel
that might help us get a lock on it.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.823
You called me to remind me to do my job?

22:06.858 --> 22:08.359
Darling, it's not like that.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.860
Yeah.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.533
You're familiar with the Shining Sword?

22:15.534 --> 22:17.835
Fundamentalist terror network
based in the Philippines?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.804
They've been dormant
since the Bali bombings of '02.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.038
Are they operational again?

22:21.039 --> 22:23.633
Earlier today we intercepted
a burst transmission

22:23.709 --> 22:26.610
which indicates
that an operative of Shining Sword

22:26.678 --> 22:28.245
has acquired a plasma charge.

22:28.246 --> 22:31.477
Plasma charge?
I thought those were only theoretical.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.217
According to the burst transmission,

22:33.218 --> 22:36.915
the operative is shipping the bomb
to one of their European cells.

22:36.988 --> 22:39.582
Is the bomb being shipped transpacific
or via the Atlantic?

22:39.658 --> 22:41.559
We don't know,
but we traced the transmission

22:41.560 --> 22:43.794
to a digital storage facility in Vancouver

22:43.795 --> 22:46.423
where the Shining Sword operative
maintains his database.

22:46.498 --> 22:50.559
Sydney, Vaughn. You'll go to the facility
looking to lease vault space.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.737
Once inside you'll uplink with Marshall.

22:52.738 --> 22:56.731
Now, if we're lucky, the operative will
have archived the details of the shipment

22:56.808 --> 22:59.436
and we can intercept the bomb
before it's delivered.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.439
Lauren, we need to talk.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.349
Lauren?

23:05.350 --> 23:07.978
Everything I needed to say
I've already said.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.920
Then here's my turn.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.549
The implication that somehow I've set out
to undermine your marriage

23:12.624 --> 23:14.325
is wrong and unfair.

23:14.326 --> 23:18.387
I've done nothing but respect
the relationship that you and Vaughn have.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.435
You were saying?

23:26.471 --> 23:29.304
Vaughn and I have a history,
a complicated one.

23:29.374 --> 23:32.832
I can't deny that,
but I won't apologize for it either.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.005
If your marriage is in trouble,
if you and Vaughn are having problems,

23:36.081 --> 23:40.211
I suggest you leave me out of it
and take it up with your husband.

23:52.998 --> 23:56.331
Are you ready for our first job
as senior management?

23:56.401 --> 23:59.393
You're so ambitious. I love it.

23:59.471 --> 24:03.532
The job's in Vancouver. It requires
a breach of a digital storage facility.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.736
<i>- Really? What's the prize?
- A plasma charge.</i>

24:07.179 --> 24:09.380
<i>Next-generation destructive power.</i>

24:09.381 --> 24:13.112
- I thought those were just theoretical.
- Apparently not in Vancouver.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.685
<i>- All right. I'll meet you there in four hours.
- Three.</i>

24:15.720 --> 24:18.587
We have to be first in line.
The CIA are sending agents.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.724
<i>- Who?
- One guess.</i>

24:20.725 --> 24:24.252
Oh, sweetheart. This should be fun.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.997
I'll see you in Vancouver.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.899
Don't be late.
Or call me "sweetheart. "

24:29.968 --> 24:32.468
<i>Ambitious and domineering.</i>

24:32.537 --> 24:35.037
Fantastic.

24:46.351 --> 24:47.918
How long before
Sydney and Vaughn get here?

24:47.919 --> 24:49.687
20 minutes, if that.

24:49.688 --> 24:53.180
Well, you'd better show me
the meaning of haste.

24:53.258 --> 24:58.855
Once we have the transport information,
I'll corrupt the files, leave the CIA blind.

24:58.930 --> 25:02.093
It looks like another black mark
on your husband's record.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.796
How does it feel to systematically ruin
a man from the inside out?

25:05.871 --> 25:08.999
It wouldn't be the first time.
Buzz me into 2201.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.479
As we discussed over the phone,

25:15.480 --> 25:18.643
our telescopes gather over 350 gigabytes
of information per day.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.652
Not a problem. Our vaults are designed
to accommodate teraflops.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.689
You could store 20 years of data
in the vault you've leased.

25:24.756 --> 25:27.350
Number 2289 please, Luc.

25:29.594 --> 25:32.961
Data is backed up twice daily. The servers
are monitored around the clock.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.735
Hurry. Hurry.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.432
...his former sweetheart are early.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.439
They're headed for room 2289.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.102
Planting the virus now.
Get out and get the car ready.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.012
You are so controlling.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.713
Move it. I'm right behind you.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.049
If you need anything, you can call me.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.712
Thank you.

25:59.424 --> 26:01.125
Luc?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.494
<i>Marshall, what's happening?</i>

26:03.495 --> 26:06.794
I don't know. There's someone else
in the system with you.

26:06.865 --> 26:07.731
Here, from our end?

26:07.732 --> 26:09.600
It has to be.
There's no other way to access the files.

26:09.601 --> 26:12.101
I think they just planted a virus.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.934
Luc?

26:15.006 --> 26:17.506
Has anybody seen Luc?

26:22.514 --> 26:24.615
God.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.984
Drop the walkie.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.485
Please. Don't hurt me.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.291
You think about pointing that gun at me
and I'll shoot you in the heart.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.296
The couple in room 2289, when they
come out, I want you to kill them both.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.699
- What?
- Or you die. It's your choice.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.533
But I haven't shot a gun...

26:44.603 --> 26:49.165
- This isn't a negotiation.
- OK. OK.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.073
Let's get out of here.

26:53.678 --> 26:56.408
Please. Don't do this.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.396
The shooter.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.234
There! Vaughn!

27:57.175 --> 27:59.735
- They're right behind us.
- Yes, thank you, I can see that.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.501
Vaughn!

28:33.344 --> 28:34.378
Stop the car.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.879
- What are you talking about?
- Stop the car now. Pull in here.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.375
<i>How was your day?</i>

29:05.376 --> 29:09.107
<i>- Oh, frustrating. Hit a bit of a roadblock.
- Anything I can help you with?</i>

29:09.180 --> 29:10.848
No, but thanks for asking.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.349
<i>Michael, would you mind
holding a second?</i>

29:12.350 --> 29:14.850
No, go ahead.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.887
I'm working.

29:23.128 --> 29:28.532
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm being called away. I love you.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.100
<i>Uh, you too.</i>

29:35.473 --> 29:38.704
- Tell me, did they spot us?
- No, I don't think so.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.269
According to the transport order,
the ship docks in 16 hours.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.548
We should get going.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.784
You should know...

29:46.785 --> 29:49.119
you were amazing.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.620
Before, I mean.

29:53.558 --> 29:57.961
Typically, this is where
you return the compliment.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.597
I am not your patient...

30:08.673 --> 30:10.307
your client...

30:10.308 --> 30:13.209
or your lab rat.

30:13.278 --> 30:17.647
But there are some truths
you will never learn from me.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.983
Do you understand that?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.985
This was a mistake. Sorry.

30:31.896 --> 30:32.930
Hi.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.431
Could I get my coat, please?

30:40.238 --> 30:44.072
Until I turned into a complete son of a
bitch, we were having a wonderful evening.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.804
Something we can both agree on.

30:48.613 --> 30:52.276
Though I am now known
as a humanitarian...

30:52.350 --> 30:55.547
Your words, not mine.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.120
I sometimes regress.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.752
Dr. Barnett, I'm sorry I snapped at you.

31:03.828 --> 31:07.594
Trusting you, trusting anyone,
will take time.

31:08.466 --> 31:11.264
You know so much about me.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.836
I know almost nothing about you.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.137
I want to. Very much.

31:19.010 --> 31:23.640
I'm not sure I can understand
how your manipulating this date

31:23.715 --> 31:26.215
can help you gain my trust.

31:30.755 --> 31:34.122
Would you excuse us for a moment?
Thanks.

31:38.096 --> 31:41.122
You want my secret?

31:41.199 --> 31:43.895
I'll tell you. But only you.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.598
I have betrayed people,
many of whom deserved it.

31:52.944 --> 31:56.072
But only one didn't.

31:56.147 --> 31:58.647
It was a long time ago.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.752
I sometimes try to convince myself
that it was worth it, that she was worth it.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.416
What is this? You had an affair?

32:08.459 --> 32:10.959
Yes.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.893
It was Irina Derevko.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.968
Sydney's mother.

32:22.040 --> 32:27.000
Jack never knew. Emily, my wife,

32:27.078 --> 32:29.313
she never knew.

32:29.314 --> 32:33.774
Irina and I pledged to take that secret
to our graves.

32:35.086 --> 32:40.183
Are you telling me
Sydney... is your daughter?

32:45.563 --> 32:48.063
Mm.

32:48.499 --> 32:52.458
I never tried to prove it,
one way or the other.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.669
But the strength that Sydney finds within...

33:00.745 --> 33:04.476
I like to believe that comes from me.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.484
Well, how about that?

33:14.525 --> 33:17.187
The world didn't come to an end.

33:28.873 --> 33:31.740
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.
We're on board.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.343
We have you five-by, Mountaineer.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.513
- Hot or cold?
- Freezing.

33:42.553 --> 33:45.113
It's a tranquilizer dart.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.420
The humanitarian work of the CIA.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.060
Let's go.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.167
<i>Towards the stern,
30 yards below us.</i>

34:04.742 --> 34:07.939
<i>We can't let them go below deck.</i>

34:20.725 --> 34:22.391
Mountaineer? Boy Scout? Report.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.418
Vaughn, are you OK?

34:29.367 --> 34:32.268
Yeah. I'm fine.

34:32.335 --> 34:35.328
But I'm glad I wore the vest.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.966
We have to get the bomb.

34:47.952 --> 34:52.786
<i>- Meet me in the engine room.
- I'm going to the upper deck.</i>

34:58.563 --> 35:01.063
<i>It's just ahead.</i>

35:02.934 --> 35:05.434
Go to the engine room.
I'll cover.

35:21.919 --> 35:25.013
It's secured.
I'm gonna need a minute.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.934
<i>Freeze.</i>

35:41.873 --> 35:44.373
Drop the gun.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.515
Put your hands in the air.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.314
Put your hands in the air!

35:54.385 --> 35:57.320
Now turn around. Slowly.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.123
Turn around.

36:08.065 --> 36:10.565
Take off the mask.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.630
Do it. Take off the mask.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.982
Take off the mask.

36:30.788 --> 36:33.288
Put the gun down, Agent Vaughn.

36:33.324 --> 36:36.487
- Drop the gun.
- Not a chance. You drop yours.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.655
- Put the gun down now. Drop it!
- No, Vaughn, don't!

36:41.232 --> 36:45.498
If you love her,
you'll put the gun down now.

36:53.411 --> 36:56.539
Vaughn, don't!

37:27.411 --> 37:29.646
<i>Sark's got the bomb.</i>

37:29.647 --> 37:32.172
OK, you go after him.
I'm gonna cut off Sark.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.750
Got it!

38:12.957 --> 38:15.457
I've lost mine.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.303
Freeze!

38:29.307 --> 38:31.807
Give me the bomb.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.645
<i>Give it to me.</i>

38:38.716 --> 38:41.216
With pleasure.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.961
<i>Sark activated the bomb.
I've got to defuse it.</i>

38:51.962 --> 38:53.129
OK, describe it to me.

38:53.130 --> 38:56.065
All right. It looks sort of like a
VS-5 land mine, but with a timer attached.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.534
We have 40 seconds.

38:57.535 --> 39:00.095
<i>- Vaughn, find the power source.
- A battery, something like that.</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:02.439
All right. There's something here. It looks
like a cellphone wrapped in fiber optics.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.898
- No, no, no. Don't touch that.
- He's right. It's a secondary trigger.

39:05.976 --> 39:06.843
<i>33 seconds.</i>

39:06.844 --> 39:08.511
OK, find the blue wire
attached to the screw

39:08.512 --> 39:11.447
<i>and then open up the valve
near the stem.</i>

39:11.515 --> 39:13.383
I did that. It's still ticking.
We have 14 seconds.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.317
<i>Listen. You're gonna short it.</i>

39:14.318 --> 39:17.754
Strip the black wire and the red wire
and then attach them together.

39:17.822 --> 39:18.988
I don't know if
I'm gonna have time to do that.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.458
No, you can do it. You can do it.
You can do it. You can do it, Vaughn.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.959
You can do it. You can do it.
You can do it.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.065
Plasma charge is secure.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.706
See? Told you you could do it.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.885
- You're an angel for waiting.
- Hey.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.949
No problem. I've had good company.

39:57.361 --> 39:58.561
How was Washington?

39:58.562 --> 40:01.929
Awful. I'm happier now that
I'm home with you.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.000
Me too.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.598
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

40:10.674 --> 40:11.841
Hello?

40:11.842 --> 40:15.505
<i>It killed you, didn't it?
Seeing him drop the gun for Sydney.</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:18.079
No, it isn't a good time.
Can I call you in the morning?

40:18.149 --> 40:21.084
<i>He's there with you, is that it?</i>

40:21.152 --> 40:24.280
<i>Though he'd rather be with her.</i>

40:24.355 --> 40:28.519
<i>You know, it's quite a charade
you two are engaged in.</i>

40:28.592 --> 40:31.459
I think we both know how dedicated I am
to this assignment.

40:31.529 --> 40:34.521
If you have any issues,
take it up through the proper channels.

40:34.598 --> 40:39.592
<i>Don't mistake me.
It's not your dedication that I question.</i>

40:41.038 --> 40:44.303
We'll talk about this later.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.875
Sorry about that.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.445
Work is officially over.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.020
What was that for?

41:01.158 --> 41:03.658
I just miss you.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.239
<i># Round and round</i>

41:22.313 --> 41:24.147
<i># Carousel</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:29.142
- I thought you'd be home by now.
- I was about to say the same to you.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.825
The plasma charge.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.327
It's in our hands.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.560
Sark isn't.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.431
The Covenant.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.006
Have you had dinner?

41:51.041 --> 41:55.034
If memory serves,
you always liked Michelli's.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.945
I haven't eaten there since I was eight.

42:02.987 --> 42:05.820
I do eat, you know.

42:11.595 --> 42:14.462
I'd like that, actually.

42:15.633 --> 42:19.967
<i># Lonely</i>

42:21.238 --> 42:27.768
<i># Lonely</i>

43:05.516 --> 43:08.016
<i>Bad robot!</i>
