14:19.233 --> 14:22.486
I purchased a 65-foot vessel, got a crew,

14:23.279 --> 14:28.200
and sent the boat off to be loaded up
with 15,000 pounds of grass.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.291
[Pam] I knew what he was going to do,
but I didn't know a lot of the details.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.878
He kept me sheltered from that
and the less I know, the better.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.132
[Randy] I didn't want to keep the weed
at my house.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.676
So, I needed a stash house.

14:47.386 --> 14:51.473
But I didn't look the part of someone
who could afford high-lease rent.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.475
So, I needed a front guy.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.228
[upbeat jazzy music playing]

15:06.614 --> 15:11.285
Charles had a presence
and a demeanor that stood out.

15:11.869 --> 15:16.165
He was running a company
that was importing olive oil

15:16.248 --> 15:18.208
and cheese from Italy,

15:18.292 --> 15:22.504
so, he could present himself
as a legit business guy.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.173
[Charles] Love this belt.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.216
A gift from the House of Versace.

15:27.092 --> 15:31.555
[Randy] He was a very polite,
charming, friendly person.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.684
Looking good.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.021
I call him Chuck. You call him Charles,
but I call him Chuck.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.272
[Charles sighs]

15:40.356 --> 15:45.319
[Allan] He was a very polished kind of guy
that knew a few different languages,

15:45.819 --> 15:47.279
was well-traveled.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.032
[Charles] Rolex, best in the world.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.035
But he always kind of struck me
as somebody phony, really.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
He was just always a real nice guy.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.039
You know how some people
are just too nice?

15:57.665 --> 16:00.250
Nobody's that fucking nice, you know?
[laughs]

16:01.502 --> 16:06.757
[Randy] He was clean-cut, business suits,
so he fit the bill for a front guy.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.178
The first thing that I did for him
was renting a house.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.723
He had come to me because I had
a very straight appearance, obviously.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.770
So, Randy needed a minimum
of five acres of land.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.732
Not in a residential area,
kind of out in the country.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.275
You know, horse farms.

16:25.359 --> 16:30.239
You know, he wanted to be very low-key
and neighbors not nearby.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.658
Where a car could come in and leave,

16:32.741 --> 16:34.368
really without being detected.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.121
He would pay me, instead of money

16:37.204 --> 16:39.623
to do this favor for him,
he would give me a bag of weed.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.585
Which, to me, was the same thing as money,
so it was good.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.171
[suspense music playing]

16:47.131 --> 16:50.676
[Randy] My plan was to bring the boat
about a half a mile off-shore

16:51.635 --> 16:55.723
and use Zodiacs
as the runner back and forth.

16:57.099 --> 17:02.271
And Zodiacs are these rubberized vessels.
Navy Seal teams use them.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.733
Soon as the sun went down,
so around nine o'clock,

17:05.816 --> 17:09.319
the operation began,
and we had till sunup.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.782
[Allan] We'd load up
the bales of pot into the Zodiac,

17:15.409 --> 17:20.039
and there was so much pot
that I had to literally lay my body

17:20.122 --> 17:24.501
over the tops of the bales
and try to hold them all together.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.213
The batteries are underwater,

17:28.297 --> 17:31.258
so I'm getting the shit shocked out of me,
and I'm like lightening up.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.928
[Charles] Once we got 'em up to the shore,

17:35.012 --> 17:38.849
we just started grabbing the bales,
dragging them off the Zodiac

17:38.932 --> 17:40.309
and up this dune.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.854
We started then loading the vans.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.565
[crickets chirping]

17:47.107 --> 17:51.528
[Randy] I'm looking south,
and all of a sudden I see a lit cigarette.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.615
Oh, shit. We got beach walkers.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.410
If they see us offloading,

17:58.494 --> 18:01.497
they're gonna call the police,
and everybody's going to jail.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.334
So I radioed my friend down on the beach,
"Do you see them?"

18:06.335 --> 18:07.920
And he said, "Yes, I see them."

18:08.879 --> 18:11.256
I said, "Do not hurt anybody."

18:13.050 --> 18:16.845
But when you have a gun in someone's hand,
you don't know how they're gonna act.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.140
They stop right at where my friend is.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.524
And they turn around and leave.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.192
[tension resolves]

18:33.445 --> 18:35.531
[engine turning over]

18:38.075 --> 18:40.119
[Charles] I was very careful to drive

18:40.202 --> 18:43.497
doing the speed limit,
making sure nothing went wrong,

18:43.580 --> 18:46.250
that I got that marijuana
back to the stash house.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.128
Pulled it in the garage,
and I started unloading it.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.047
And started dragging the bales 
back to one of the bedrooms.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.844
And it was, I mean,
floor to ceiling of weed.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.056
[Allan] We just pulled off
unloading seven tons of marijuana

19:01.140 --> 19:04.977
on the coast of Melbourne, Florida,
and got away with it.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.397
And the weed was fabulous, by the way.
It was really good.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.819
[Allan] I was responsible
for guarding the house

19:13.902 --> 19:16.613
to make sure that nobody would rip us off.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.991
[dog growling]

19:19.074 --> 19:23.954
We had dogs that were killer dogs.
I mean, they were trained killer dogs.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.207
[Charles] We had Mad Max.
And Max was crazy.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.834
And there was only two or three people.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.836
Randy could go near him,
I could go near him,

19:30.919 --> 19:33.255
but nobody else could go near him.
He wanted to kill you.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.757
The only way I could get him
in and out of the house was…

19:35.841 --> 19:38.552
to take a piece of hot dog or something
and throw it out there.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.930
[Randy] So, Allan was
one of the guys that I could trust

19:42.014 --> 19:45.601
that I knew he would not steal no weed

19:45.684 --> 19:48.061
and he would be honorable
while he was there

19:48.145 --> 19:49.605
and protect the load.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.024
-[producer] Did you ever help yourself?
-Oh, of course.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.234
Shit, I'd walk over to cut open any bale

19:54.318 --> 19:58.655
and pull out a nice bun and twist it up
right there. Hell, yeah. [laughing]

19:58.739 --> 19:59.740
Yeah.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.828
[Randy] The weed was gone the next day.
I made a little over a million dollars.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.498
Not a bad payday.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.879
[calculator]
Four, nine, point six… equals.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.257
[car accelerating]

20:17.966 --> 20:22.304
[Randy] And I ended up winning
the South Eastern Amateur Championship,

20:22.888 --> 20:26.475
so I started thinking about
maybe going professional.

20:31.813 --> 20:35.484
Low and behold, the Miami Grand Prix
come into town.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.694
-[cars revving]
-[fast-paced music playing]

20:40.072 --> 20:42.032
[man] Dream machines, fantasy cars

20:42.115 --> 20:44.826
have come to life this weekend
on the streets of Miami.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.164
This is a race for IMSA GTP cars.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.376
P for prototype.
Definition, anything goes.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.295
[Charles] Those were expensive cars.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.590
You know, we're talking tens of millions
of dollars to run these cars.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.261
[Randy] You have
a lot of professional teams,

21:02.344 --> 21:04.471
but there's also a lot of private teams.

21:06.014 --> 21:10.143
A friend of mine named Marty Hinze,
he had a private race car team.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.854
I told him I'd like to give it a try.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.315
And, um, he said I could drive the car.

21:17.859 --> 21:21.405
[female reporter] 150,000 people
are expected to converge

21:21.488 --> 21:24.741
on Downtown Miami this weekend
for the Grand Prix event.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.162
And we were really excited about that race
because that's in our backyard.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.290
[racing cars wailing]

21:31.373 --> 21:35.544
[reporter] The Grand Prix race organizers
are predicting that spectator excitement

21:35.627 --> 21:38.130
will be as high then
as it was with the Super Bowl.

21:38.213 --> 21:42.467
[man] It's a major international event.
Television coverage is gonna be worldwide.

21:45.095 --> 21:50.058
[Randy] Because I'm a local guy here,
I'm doing radio shows, talk shows.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.438
[Pam] This was a very important race
for his career.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.608
He was good at what he did,
but he was an amateur,

21:59.109 --> 22:00.986
so he had to prove himself.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.951
[Randy] We qualified the car really good,
and I'm excited,

22:08.035 --> 22:10.037
thinking that I could win this race.

22:11.163 --> 22:15.125
I had a lot of friends in Miami,
so, I rented the Everglades Hotel,

22:15.625 --> 22:17.461
the presidential suite.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.546
Big party. Huge party.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.383
We were snorting a lot of coke
and drinking a lot of champagne.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.184
We go out in the morning,
practice session…

22:32.267 --> 22:34.269
[dramatic music playing]

22:37.522 --> 22:38.482
…and it's raining.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.447
[tires squealing]

22:46.114 --> 22:48.241
And I'm working as hard as I could work

22:48.325 --> 22:50.660
without losing control of the car…

22:50.744 --> 22:52.621
[racing cars accelerating, wailing]

22:55.207 --> 22:56.625
…and the gear box breaks.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.715
And it was such a let-down.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.304
I go back into the garage area
with the car and find out that

23:09.388 --> 23:11.973
the owner of the car
doesn't have no spare parts.

23:12.641 --> 23:17.354
And I sat and watched
the Miami Grand Prix from my hotel suite

23:17.437 --> 23:19.523
when I was supposed to have been
on the track.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.150
[Pam] He was angry.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.738
He was just building his name up,
and it didn't look good.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.323
Did not look good at all.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.911
And I made my mind up that day

23:33.745 --> 23:35.956
that I'm gonna do my own race car team.

23:37.541 --> 23:41.002
[producer] Where were you gonna get
the money to fund your own team?

23:43.213 --> 23:45.715
[laughing]

23:45.799 --> 23:47.801
[lively instrumental music playing]

23:47.884 --> 23:49.886
[birds chirping]

23:54.015 --> 23:55.350
[Randy] I had connections.

24:04.609 --> 24:09.030
I knew that the Colombian product
was top grade, top flight weed.

24:12.784 --> 24:17.873
And my buyers liked good weed.
Just like people like good coffee.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.083
[laughs]

24:21.251 --> 24:24.004
Dealing directly with the Colombians
was an opportunity

24:24.087 --> 24:26.256
to make vast sums of money.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.263
We hiked for about a half a day,
up into like a jungle.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.602
And they had brought down bales
of what you call punta roja.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.811
Fresh red bud.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.314
It smelled good.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.983
It was gummy and tacky.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.361
And it was probably
some of the best weed that I've seen.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.576
So, I said, "Yeah,
this is what I'm looking for right here."

24:56.411 --> 24:57.704
But we got a problem.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.876
[Ronald Reagan]
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear

25:02.959 --> 25:06.421
that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.256
So, help me God.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.717
[chief justice Burger]
May I congratulate you, sir.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.761
[Marine Band plays "Hail to the Chief"]

25:12.844 --> 25:14.095
[cheering and applause]

25:16.515 --> 25:19.976
[Randy] Ronald Reagan came into office
and started putting down

25:20.060 --> 25:25.023
orders for the US Customs
and Marine Patrol to step up their game.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.983
[male reporter]
The Blue Lightening Strike Force

25:27.067 --> 25:29.945
is a customs-coordinated,
multi-agency drug interdiction team.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.447
The essence of Blue Lightening is speed.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.992
That's what this boat,
and this task force, represent.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.120
[Randy] Every time they'd capture
a drug smuggler,

25:39.204 --> 25:42.082
the US Coast Guard
would paint a big marijuana leaf

25:42.165 --> 25:43.375
on the side of their vessel.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.086
They would come and make a big show of it.

25:46.169 --> 25:49.464
Put all the drugs on the dock
and all the people handcuffed,

25:49.548 --> 25:52.217
bragging about how many people
they were busting.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.511
[President Reagan]
Here at Homestead Air Force Base,

25:54.594 --> 25:57.389
we see visible evidence
of the federal commitment

25:57.472 --> 26:00.976
to the war on criminal drug smuggling
in South Florida.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.772
[Randy] Before, we was just taking
our own vessels and filling it up.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.776
And if you got pulled over by customs,
they would find it.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.611
It was just too exposed.

26:11.695 --> 26:16.116
Uh, you know, to do that amount of weed,
in that way, uh,

26:16.199 --> 26:18.660
we had to find another way to do it.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.038
[Randy] So, I had an idea.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.927
[ship horn honking]

26:39.139 --> 26:43.268
One of my distributors introduced me
to a gentleman named Eugene Fisher.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.564
Gene owned a salvage and tug operation

26:47.647 --> 26:53.945
and had, available to us, a 300-foot barge
with a 110-foot tugboat.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.410
The barge arrives in Colombia,
and this is similar to the barge.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.912
It's seven-stories high, 300-feet long.

27:03.747 --> 27:07.709
And they have on each side of the barge
what's called ballast tanks.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.921
Compartments that they pump saltwater in

27:12.005 --> 27:15.133
to make the boat ride equally
in the water.

27:15.216 --> 27:18.011
So, what we figured out, if we welded
three quarter inch steel

27:18.094 --> 27:22.015
halfway up the ballast tanks,
we would have hollow compartments

27:22.098 --> 27:25.185
in the bottom of the barge.
That's where we stored the marijuana.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.228
So, if we got pulled over by customs,

27:27.312 --> 27:30.273
they'd see it was full of saltwater,
and that was it.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.819
The first load was 110,000 pounds of weed.

27:35.820 --> 27:40.200
When the barge arrives
into the United States, we clear customs.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.660
[suspenseful music playing]

27:44.788 --> 27:47.374
It'd go straight to a dock…

27:48.667 --> 27:51.961
at a abandoned gas station
that we had leased.

27:52.545 --> 27:56.800
But before I unload it, I wanna make sure
that there's no police watching it.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.720
So, I asked two distributors that I knew

28:00.804 --> 28:03.973
to drive around the waterfront
with a scanner that I gave them

28:04.057 --> 28:05.433
to listen to the chatter.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.936
[indistinct radio chatter]

28:08.019 --> 28:12.023
I wanted some activity at the gas station
where the barge is docked at.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.652
So, I also had a different guy go there.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.489
The guys that's driving around
the waterfront came back

28:19.572 --> 28:23.076
and reported that they heard
"suspect entering compound."

28:24.077 --> 28:25.704
It's like, "Oh, shit."

28:26.371 --> 28:27.706
"They're on to us."

28:29.582 --> 28:31.668
So now we're all really paranoid.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.672
Took 30 days to find another spot.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.805
The abandoned Brooklyn Naval Yards.

28:44.639 --> 28:48.101
But we had to pay
some mob guy $500,000

28:48.184 --> 28:50.103
in order to let us use the spot.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.814
[producer]
How did that affect your profits?

28:53.398 --> 28:54.441
Very little.

28:59.028 --> 29:02.282
[Allan]
I found myself in the hull of a ship,

29:02.365 --> 29:04.784
and there were stacks of bales of pot.

29:05.452 --> 29:09.539
They were like 20, 30-feet high.
I mean, that was a shitload of pot, man.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.624
[welder crackling]

29:14.502 --> 29:18.047
We had a trailer set inside
the hull of the ship.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.466
The crane would set it in there.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.760
We would load 'em up
in the middle of the night,

29:21.843 --> 29:23.052
and they'd pull it out.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.223
[Charles] The only thing somebody
in the shipyard would have seen

29:27.307 --> 29:30.518
is a crane picking up a container
and putting it on a truck.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.521
Very normal. You see that every day.

29:34.481 --> 29:37.817
[Randy] I already had distributors
waiting for the weed.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.613
[Charles] My role was receiving
the money from these distributors

29:41.696 --> 29:44.365
and then dispersing the money to Randy.

29:45.700 --> 29:50.455
[Randy] I sold the 110,000 pounds
for $310 a pound.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.375
My cut was right at ten million dollars.

29:56.753 --> 30:00.799
And I thought,
"Now I can afford my race car team."

30:02.592 --> 30:03.843
[reporter] Do you know this man?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.595
He hasn't done
any credit card commercials,

30:05.678 --> 30:08.640
but a year ago, Randy Lanier's car
broke down in practice

30:08.723 --> 30:10.475
the morning of the Miami Grand Prix.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.019
That frustration
led to a very big decision.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
It gets disappointing
when you don't finish a race,

30:15.188 --> 30:18.024
and I figured there had to be a better way
to finish some races

30:18.107 --> 30:21.486
and maybe win some, and that idea
was putting my own team together.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.573
[present-day Randy]
So, I formed a team for 1984,

30:25.657 --> 30:27.951
to race in the IMSA GTP series,

30:28.034 --> 30:29.786
and named it Blue Thunder Racing.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.497
First, I needed a co-driver.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.666
I went and talked to my friend,
Bill Whittington.

30:35.458 --> 30:38.253
He's a hell of a race car driver,
very fast.

30:38.753 --> 30:41.005
Had won Le Mans in 1979.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.465
[crowd cheering]

30:42.549 --> 30:44.717
Track's good.
Well, I've always liked a fast track.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.554
You know, we can hold a flat in a bowl
and that's a big thrill.

30:47.637 --> 30:51.224
[Randy] I asked him if he would come
as a co-driver. And he agreed.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.812
And he suggested hiring a crew chief
from the UK

30:55.895 --> 30:57.772
that had great racing credentials.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.192
[Keith] Randy was very new.

31:01.276 --> 31:05.321
So, I just thought he was the guy
that wanted to have a bit of fun,

31:05.864 --> 31:08.992
talk to his mates about it,
you know, might finish somewhere.

31:09.075 --> 31:12.704
You know, "I finished tenth in this race,
and I did really well," you know?

31:14.080 --> 31:17.417
[Randy] I told him
not to worry about any expenses.

31:17.917 --> 31:21.045
Whatever he needed,
I was gonna see that he got it.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.883
I made a decision
that I was gonna run a two-car team.

31:25.925 --> 31:29.554
Two cars,
you're probably looking at $350,000.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.515
[producer] Where did you think
the money was coming from?

31:32.599 --> 31:34.225
[inhales deeply]

31:34.309 --> 31:35.393
Um…

31:38.062 --> 31:41.566
I was the bank. [laughs]
I was the banker.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.320
They made deposits,
and I made distributions.

31:48.406 --> 31:53.244
[Allan] Randy's crew was all pretty much
us friends that we had grown up together

31:53.328 --> 31:54.287
selling pot.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.706
So, I would be
hanging out in the garage and…

31:56.789 --> 31:59.375
fucking make hot dogs and hamburgers
for everybody for lunch.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.795
And then I just kind of became the cook
for the race team.

32:06.758 --> 32:11.346
And I made a point with my guys
not to discuss anything illegal

32:11.429 --> 32:12.639
at the race track.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.768
[commentator]
We're getting ready for the green flags.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.603
So, let's go to Brock and Steve
at the track.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.522
[reporter] Thank you, Ed.
It's a very exciting day at Riverside,

32:21.606 --> 32:25.109
as on the pole with a new track record
over a 130 miles an hour,

32:25.193 --> 32:28.863
is an all-American built Ford Mustang GTP.

32:28.947 --> 32:33.910
We are a private team, taking on
nearly every major car manufacturer.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.330
-Ford, Jaguar and Porsche.
-[engines revving]

32:38.289 --> 32:40.249
The other teams probably thought

32:40.333 --> 32:44.003
that we was gonna be a team
to not worry about.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.882
And on the outside of the front row
the Randy Lanier-Bill Whittington car.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.927
Randy, uh, you got a fast car
right beside you.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.513
You gonna try to take the lead early,
or hang back a bit?

32:53.596 --> 32:57.809
[Randy] We're gonna just stay back,
play it by ear for about the first hour.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.144
-[Brock] Okay, well, good luck.
-Thank you very much.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.612
[engines revving]

33:18.496 --> 33:20.790
[commentator] We have a start
to the Los Angeles Grand Prix.

33:20.873 --> 33:25.044
Bobby Rahal in the Ford Mustang,
up through the S's and into the lead.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.172
And Randy Lanier who started
in the front row is now back to fourth.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.300
[Randy] We was competing,
not only against the factories,

33:31.384 --> 33:35.471
but against the most highly-skilled
drivers on the planet.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.306
[comm] And now, a new leader here,

33:37.390 --> 33:40.226
Derek Bell, one of the very best
endurance drivers in the world.

33:40.309 --> 33:44.522
These Porsche cars are so tough to beat
in endurance racing, Steve.

33:44.605 --> 33:45.648
[revving]

33:45.732 --> 33:47.775
I'm just driving as hard as I can.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.946
[comm] And a guy who is maturing today
as a driver is Randy Lanier.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.698
He has moved into the third spot.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.783
[fast-paced music playing]

33:56.743 --> 33:58.745
It was like he had a fever, man.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.667
[comm] And here is Bobby Rahal,
in the Ford Mustang number seven,

34:04.751 --> 34:07.253
currently running second,
but Rahal is coming into the pit.

34:08.671 --> 34:11.257
[Keith]
The Ford Mustang comes flying in the pit.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.176
But it's worn out. I mean, it's done.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.431
[comm] Derek Bell now leads
and this man, Randy Lanier from Florida,

34:18.514 --> 34:20.349
is in the second spot.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.102
And then it's a direct fight
between us and Porsche.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.605
[cars revving, whooshing]

34:26.439 --> 34:29.650
[commentator] Randy Lanier brings
the second-place car into the pit area.

34:30.943 --> 34:34.238
We concentrated on the pit stop.
To make time.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.033
[comm]
The very aggressive Bill Whittington

34:37.116 --> 34:39.410
just rips car runner Randy Lanier
out of the car.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.997
He's gonna have to hurry
because the distance is opening.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.083
[Brock] A very nice pit stop, well done.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.167
Thank you very much.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.418
How's the car feel to you now?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.212
You're running very high,
second, I believe.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.963
Well, car's running real good right now.

34:51.798 --> 34:52.882
We might have a chance.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.967
[engines accelerating]

34:55.760 --> 34:58.554
[comm] Randy Lanier
is listening to Whittington on the radio.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.848
You gotta wonder
what he's saying right now.

35:01.307 --> 35:04.852
But look at Whittington.
He is taking no prisoners here.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.145
[laughs]

35:08.523 --> 35:11.234
And then the Porsche came in
to change their drivers.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.320
[comm] You know, seldom, Brock,

35:14.403 --> 35:16.030
are endurance races won or lost
in the pit,

35:16.114 --> 35:17.448
but this may be the exception.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.159
And Derek Bell
is coming out of the automobile.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.744
This is a complete surprise.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.038
Derek Bell
gets out of the car unannounced.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.627
Derek looks around for Al Holbert,
who wasn't ready.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.045
A tragic miscue.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.381
There's been a change in the lead.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.883
[car accelerating]

35:37.677 --> 35:40.847
It's Bill Whittington up against
the state-of-the-art Porsche.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.682
The fans are going wild over this.

35:46.060 --> 35:50.648
Al Holbert gets underway, Bill Whittington
opens the gap in first place.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.484
He's racing his balls off.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.906
[comm] This is absolutely the best finish
I've ever had the privilege of watching.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.868
Look at Lanier's crew.
Lanier is trying to drive that car.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.414
Heading toward the checkered flag.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.004
[men cheering, whistling]

36:14.922 --> 36:18.009
[comm] Randy Lanier and his team
are going absolutely nuts.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.764
We was just ecstatic.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.725
[Brock]
Bill Whittington, Randy Lanier,

36:25.808 --> 36:27.643
couldn't have made it
any closer than that.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.020
[laughs]

36:29.604 --> 36:30.938
Fantastic.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.815
Randy, let me get you first.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.192
Kinda tense at the end, huh?

36:34.275 --> 36:36.652
Oh, so touching.
It was like waiting for a baby.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.778
[Brock laughs]

36:37.862 --> 36:43.034
The Porsche team threw their boards
on the ground… they couldn't handle it.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.076
[laughs]

36:44.160 --> 36:46.078
I didn't expect him to beat them.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.040
[Brock] And so ends
one of the most exciting

36:49.123 --> 36:51.125
endurance races in recent history.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.919
Boy, are they fast.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.921
[Pam] He was not clever.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.382
It was obvious
that something was going on.

36:58.966 --> 37:02.553
All of a sudden, Blue Thunder showed up
and started winning races.

37:03.888 --> 37:08.226
[comm] And the green flag comes out,
and look at Randy Lanier leap out, wow.

37:08.309 --> 37:12.230
We were hot out the gate, man.
Are you kidding me? We were badass.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.358
[comm] Randy Lanier, just looking for
a wide enough spot on the race track

37:15.441 --> 37:17.610
to get around,
and he may have found it here.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.822
We went up to Laguna Seca.
Won the race on the last lap.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.993
[comm] Randy Lanier.
Boy, he just gets pumped up.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.247
When he gets in that automobile,
he drives it as hard as he can.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.458
[Randy] Two weeks after that,
we was in Charlotte, North Carolina.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.753
And we win that race.
So, now we got three in a row.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.421
Now we leading in points.

37:38.005 --> 37:41.801
[comm] I think you'd be a little excited
if you were leading a world-famous series

37:41.884 --> 37:43.010
like this in your first year.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.930
He has to pinch himself every once
in a while to make sure it's true.

37:48.182 --> 37:51.602
He was kicking ass.
He was killing the circuit.

[commentator] Randy Lanier,
just picking them off one by one.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.024
[Keith] As the year progressed,

37:57.108 --> 37:59.235
to start off, Bill was up here,
Randy was here.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.654
Bill stayed there,
and Randy came up to him.

38:01.737 --> 38:04.699
[commentator] Because Randy Lanier,
who's gonna relieve Bill when he--

38:04.782 --> 38:07.576
And there comes Bill. Wow!
Does he come out of that car.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.744
Right on the deck.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.538
And here goes Randy Lanier,

38:10.621 --> 38:13.666
the points leader
in this IMSA Endurance Series.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.169
Well, Randy Lanier has certainly
got all of US road racing

38:17.253 --> 38:19.213
talking about his Blue Thunder effort.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.050
He has progressed so fast that no one's
taking him lightly now. Not at all.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.428
["The Heat Is On" by Glenn Frey playing]

38:26.470 --> 38:27.972
That's when he became noticed.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.726
That's when they said, "Look at this guy."
You know, "Where did this guy come from?"

[Keith] In the second half of the year,

38:44.905 --> 38:47.325
this was one of the most humid races
in the country.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.246
[Randy] It's summer…

38:53.664 --> 38:55.207
everybody in T-shirts.

38:56.709 --> 39:01.005
And all weekend,
I've been seeing these guys in suits.

39:01.088 --> 39:03.090
[mischievous music playing]

39:09.597 --> 39:13.225
So, I tell Pam,
"I think the FBI is here watching me."

39:14.894 --> 39:18.773
I go to my motor home,
I lay down with the AC blowin' on me.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.151
And Pam comes in and says
there's two gentlemen with suits.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.780
They're outside the motor home,
and they wanted to speak to me.

39:28.449 --> 39:31.202
I go outside and introduce myself.

39:32.286 --> 39:36.374
And one of them hands me a business card.
I look at the card…

39:38.125 --> 39:39.919
and it says Michael Kranefuss.

39:40.002 --> 39:42.922
Special Vehicle Operations
for Ford Motor Company.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.844
They tell me
that they've been watching us all year.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.890
They like the progress
that we've been making with the team.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.143
And they'd like to have
a meeting with me in Detroit.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.360
Yes.

40:04.443 --> 40:08.489
I talked to Pam about it,
but my mind was already made up.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.201
I passed on the deal.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.830
I wanted to keep Blue Thunder together.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.127
[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" playing]

40:21.210 --> 40:22.628
That's what friends do.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.386
[Pam] Randy's very loyal to his friends.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.431
Almost too much.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.686
[Charles] When I got married…

40:41.605 --> 40:43.357
I asked Randy to be my best man.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.736
-[officiant] I, Charles.
-I, Charles.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.864
-Take you, Margaret.
-Take you, Margaret.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.615
-To be my wife.
-To be my wife.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.120
[Allan] Chuck was Randy's right-hand man.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.664
He was kind of part of their family.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.418
[Pam] Charles did everything
and anything for Randy.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.170
He loved him.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.298
They were brothers.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.928
I wanna congratulate Chuck and Margaret.

41:13.012 --> 41:16.056
Two of the best
and most sincere couple that I know.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.476
[crowd cheering, whooping]

41:21.103 --> 41:24.482
[Charles] I felt like I was going
through the motions for other people.

41:25.483 --> 41:31.113
You know?
Uh, I didn't have the courage to come out.

41:31.197 --> 41:35.117
You know? Uh, you know?
Because it just wasn't done then.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.870
You just didn't do that. I mean, you know.

41:37.953 --> 41:41.081
♪ Don't go changing ♪

41:41.999 --> 41:44.627
♪ To try to please me ♪

41:44.710 --> 41:47.171
[Charles] And I also had to look
at the business side of this.

41:48.005 --> 41:48.964
I'm pragmatic.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.591
What would Randy think?

41:50.674 --> 41:53.969
What would all these guys think
that I'm working with? [laughs]

41:54.053 --> 41:55.387
[dance music playing]

41:56.305 --> 41:58.390
And it afforded me a great lifestyle.

41:59.016 --> 42:03.437
We had the lifestyle of drug smugglers,
I guess.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.612
We weren't no angels.
We had fun back in those days.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.658
[Randy]
Lot of Las Vegas, lot of Monte Carlo.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.161
Pounds of caviar and cocaine.

42:20.913 --> 42:25.709
I will say I experimented
with just about everything out there.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.213
Quaaludes to LSD to mescaline.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.507
[upbeat music playing]

42:32.675 --> 42:35.511
It was a lifestyle
beyond my wildest dreams.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.264
I enjoyed the life in the fast lane
with him.

42:42.893 --> 42:46.146
[comm] Here they come side by side
down the straightaway, wow.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.357
[laughs] A classic matchup.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.361
I mean, competitors
was the Porsche factory.

42:52.444 --> 42:55.030
[Keith] As the year went on,
they were humiliated

42:55.114 --> 42:57.074
that we were taking them on
and beating them.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.492
They couldn't handle it.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.328
This is the racing service manager
in the US for Porsche.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.539
Peter, essentially, what are we
looking at here?

43:03.622 --> 43:07.293
You're looking at our latest,
newest race version in US.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.878
[Keith] They kept throwing
more money and people at it.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.130
[Peter] Six cylinder.

43:11.213 --> 43:14.258
So, they were developing the car
like crazy to try and beat us.

43:14.341 --> 43:16.468
[reporter]
Porsche's 45-foot tractor-trailer rig

43:16.552 --> 43:18.846
is jam-packed with suspension components.

43:18.929 --> 43:22.683
Gears for the transmission,
spare turbo parts, and manifolds.

43:22.766 --> 43:26.645
Actually, there's a million dollars' worth
of Porsche parts in this one trailer.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.522
And here is the most expensive part.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.734
It's the computer brain that monitors
all of the functions of the car.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.819
Eleven thousand bucks.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.279
[comm] And look at this, Steve.

43:35.362 --> 43:38.073
Derek Bell, and he is now
going after Bill Whittington.

43:38.157 --> 43:42.369
Look at this. Drives him on the inside,
and it's Derek Bell and Porsche.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.497
And we'd hear, "Oh, Porsche
has a new engine for the next race."

43:45.581 --> 43:48.959
"Oh, it's got an extra hundred horsepower.
Oh, God, what do we do now?"

43:49.543 --> 43:52.171
[comm] And you know that Randy
is feeling the pressure. Look at that.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.964
He's off the racetrack.

43:54.048 --> 43:57.509
As the checkered flag
is displayed for Derek Bell.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.930
[Randy] Towards the end of the '84 season,
we're very close in points.

44:06.435 --> 44:07.645
[Keith] Randy was pissed off.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.064
He's like, "Keith!"

44:10.147 --> 44:12.358
[mumbling rapidly]

44:12.441 --> 44:14.652
"Okay, Randy, slow down,
slow down, slow down."

44:14.735 --> 44:17.404
"All we need is some money, Randy."
[laughing]

44:21.158 --> 44:24.828
That's when I would come in
on a private jet with a briefcase.

44:27.164 --> 44:30.125
So, I go into the next to last race
of the year.

44:30.209 --> 44:34.338
If I won this particular race,
it would give me enough points

44:34.421 --> 44:36.131
to clinch the championship.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.550
But I needed to win it.

44:46.183 --> 44:48.519
[Pam] I got paranoid about that race.

44:49.311 --> 44:51.605
He was bringing too much attention
to himself…

44:52.648 --> 44:55.025
with no real legal income.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.862
Um, I just knew it couldn't last forever.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.699
[comm]
Here we find a fleet of angry Porsches

45:01.782 --> 45:05.077
going after the Chevrolet-powered march
of Bill Whittington and Randy Lanier,

45:05.160 --> 45:06.328
the series' points leaders.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.330
Can they catch them today, Brock?
We'll see.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.083
[Randy] I wanted to be
in the best position

45:11.166 --> 45:12.418
in order to win the race.

45:13.085 --> 45:15.379
So, I fielded both cars.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.090
That is Dale Whittington,
Bill's younger brother,

45:18.173 --> 45:20.634
in the other Blue Thunder
March Chevrolet.

45:20.718 --> 45:25.305
If one car broke, it would give me
the opportunity to race in the other car.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.725
[comm] The green flag is up
for Bill Whittington

45:27.808 --> 45:29.977
and the rest of the large endurance field.

45:30.519 --> 45:32.354
[cars accelerating]

45:34.356 --> 45:35.941
Porsche came with their A-game.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.655
And I obviously did stuff to make our cars
as quick as possible.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.534
Lightweight body work,
small amount of fuel.

45:45.617 --> 45:47.745
[comm]
The harder you screw down the bootstrap,

45:47.828 --> 45:49.413
the more fuel you're going to use.

45:49.496 --> 45:52.708
In a race of this distance,
pit stops could be the difference.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.463
[Randy] In the middle of the race,

45:57.546 --> 45:59.715
something broke
on the car that Bill drove.

45:59.798 --> 46:02.176
[comm] There is a problem, Brock,
for Randy Lanier.

46:02.676 --> 46:04.386
And he didn't finish the race.

46:04.928 --> 46:08.849
[comm] Oh, boy. Lanier's lost
one of the old teammates out there.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.521
That beautiful streamlined Porsche
still in the lead.

46:15.647 --> 46:16.815
Uh-oh, here's trouble.

46:16.899 --> 46:21.028
That's the second Blue Thunder March Chevy
that's had some mechanical problem.

46:22.112 --> 46:24.198
[Randy] My second car come into the pits.

46:26.116 --> 46:29.828
My heart rate must have went
from 60 or 70 to 120.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.663
[tense music playing]

46:31.747 --> 46:33.665
I decided to take over.

46:34.416 --> 46:37.169
[car wailing past]

46:43.217 --> 46:45.969
[commentator]
Randy Lanier was trying to get it started.

46:48.889 --> 46:52.309
Look at this! He may be
back in the race after all, Steve.

46:53.185 --> 46:56.605
[engine revving]

47:01.485 --> 47:05.239
And started trying to climb my way
up to the front of the pack.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.997
[comm] The normally perfect Porsche
has got problems.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.459
[Randy]
The Porsche's car ended up breaking.

47:19.002 --> 47:24.341
And towards the last ten laps of the race,
I found myself in second position.

47:28.428 --> 47:29.805
Then I'm leading the race.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.974
[engine wailing]

47:34.059 --> 47:37.229
For the last lap, I'm obviously thinking,
"Have we got enough fuel?"

47:37.312 --> 47:39.147
[accelerating]

47:40.899 --> 47:43.402
[commentator]
Now heading down into the final turn.

47:44.987 --> 47:47.281
I was like… You know, holding my heart.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.129
-[crowd whooping]
-[engine revving]

48:02.629 --> 48:04.381
[Randy] This is my first full year…

48:05.674 --> 48:07.259
and I win the championship.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.054
[indistinct clamoring]

48:12.264 --> 48:13.432
It's unheard of.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.185
[shouts indistinctly]

48:17.269 --> 48:19.688
[crowd cheering, whooping]

48:21.982 --> 48:24.109
[man] Come on, shake that harder!

48:25.110 --> 48:27.112
[crowd cheering, whooping]

48:30.616 --> 48:34.036
[Allan] One of the drivers, Derek Bell,
I think, made the comment that…

48:34.536 --> 48:37.539
nobody knows
where these Blue Thunder guys came from,

48:37.623 --> 48:42.586
but they're the only team on the circuit
where every pit crew guy wears a Rolex.

48:42.669 --> 48:43.545
[laughs]

48:45.797 --> 48:47.007
[Pam] I thought…

48:47.507 --> 48:49.259
you know, he's gotten away with it.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.511
I started purchasing things.

48:52.137 --> 48:55.474
Apartments in New York City.
Apartments here on the beach.

48:55.557 --> 48:56.558
A jet just to have.

48:57.851 --> 49:00.020
[Pam] Lavish, lavish things.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.607
Ferraris, Porsches, Mercedes.

49:03.690 --> 49:05.233
I kind of went along with him.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.862
I lived in a mansion.

49:11.156 --> 49:12.824
I was living the dream.

49:15.202 --> 49:19.748
For my daughter's sixth birthday,
we had Circus World in Orlando

49:19.831 --> 49:22.167
-bring in an elephant.
-[elephant trumpets]

49:24.586 --> 49:26.713
He got her a Volkswagen.

49:26.797 --> 49:30.300
[Randy]
Brandy, you got your own little car, huh?

49:32.886 --> 49:34.304
[revving]

49:34.388 --> 49:35.305
[Randy] Go slow!

49:36.932 --> 49:38.517
[Allan] He had the money.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.560
And he flaunted it.

49:42.813 --> 49:47.442
This ain't a guy that's worried
about a low profile. [laughing]

49:49.236 --> 49:50.737
[Pam] Randy came from poverty,

49:51.780 --> 49:53.740
and now he had everything.

49:54.866 --> 49:56.952
But… it wasn't enough.

49:59.788 --> 50:01.915
[Randy]
After winning the IMSA Championship,

50:01.999 --> 50:03.875
I figured I've done everything there.

50:04.376 --> 50:07.921
So, now, I wanted to win the Indy 500.

50:09.798 --> 50:12.259
[man] Gentlemen, start your engines.

50:13.093 --> 50:14.428
[Randy] That was my dream.

50:15.053 --> 50:18.807
Oh, the Indy 500
is probably every driver's dream.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.314
[Charles] That's when you are
in the big leagues, you know?

50:26.398 --> 50:29.359
Racing the Indy cars in the Indy circuit

50:29.443 --> 50:32.821
is, like, the highest level
you could get in car racing.

50:32.904 --> 50:36.366
That is the top of the top.
You don't get any higher than that.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.453
[comm] Let's watch as he goes
into turn one, which's right ahead of him.

50:39.536 --> 50:42.080
He's doing about
220 miles an hour right now.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.460
You gotta have nuts this big, okay?
[laughing]

50:46.543 --> 50:49.546
To do that. You see some
of the accidents and everything…

50:54.301 --> 50:56.344
You're putting your life
on the line, buddy.

50:59.931 --> 51:05.604
But those are expensive cars. [laughs]
The cars, the crew, you know?

51:05.687 --> 51:08.106
I'm thinking okay,
let's bring in bigger loads.

51:15.072 --> 51:20.077
I went and bought four cars,
ten motors, tractor and trailers.

51:21.244 --> 51:22.621
Oh, I thought it was great.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.916
I mean, you know, more weed, more money.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.169
Business expanded,
and that's a good thing. [chuckles]

51:31.463 --> 51:33.757
[newscaster] In recent years,
US authorities have begun

51:33.840 --> 51:38.053
to stem the tide of large
marijuana shipments from South America.

51:38.136 --> 51:42.224
Latest example's on Miami Beach,
where the luxury Doral hotel

51:42.307 --> 51:44.643
now doubles
as a government radar station.

51:45.644 --> 51:49.231
[reporter] Seized in less than a year,
more than 100 tons of marijuana.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.775
[Reagan] We intend to do what is necessary

51:51.858 --> 51:55.654
to end the drug menace
and cripple organized crime.

51:55.737 --> 51:57.739
[reporter]
The bill, signed by President Reagan,

51:57.823 --> 52:00.867
delivers harsher sentences
for drug-related convictions.

52:08.166 --> 52:09.251
[Pam] I was scared.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.754
Reagan had just made
the "life without parole" law.

52:13.713 --> 52:15.423
I knew that if Randy was caught…

52:16.341 --> 52:17.717
he was gonna die in prison.

52:18.218 --> 52:19.886
He was coming out in a pine box.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.018
[commentator]
Let's see if some of them-- We are green.

52:27.102 --> 52:30.397
And Sullivan still drops in
behind Mario Andretti. It's Sullivan…

52:30.480 --> 52:32.691
[Randy]
When I first started Indy car racing…

52:33.900 --> 52:35.610
I didn't fare too well.

52:36.153 --> 52:38.280
[comm] Look, another car has slowed down.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.949
Could it be out of gas?
That's Randy Lanier in the Lola.

52:41.032 --> 52:42.784
[Keith] Indy car was a different deal.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.536
Randy just wasn't comfortable

52:44.619 --> 52:48.206
turning into corners at 220,
225 miles an hour.

52:48.290 --> 52:51.960
[comm] Slowest qualifier,
defending IMSA GT Champ, Randy Lanier.

52:52.711 --> 52:55.213
[Keith] And then, as time went on,

52:55.714 --> 52:58.133
I had got more and more aware
that we were being watched.

53:00.927 --> 53:04.389
And I said to Randy,
"People are watching us."

53:04.472 --> 53:06.474
[producer]
What did these people look like?

53:07.684 --> 53:11.188
Uh, how would you typically say
an FBI guy looks like?

53:13.315 --> 53:15.609
[Randy]
I started noticing cars following me.

53:17.694 --> 53:21.489
Just leaving my house,
and I would pick up a tail.

53:22.407 --> 53:25.076
[Pam] At one time
he thought our house was bugged,

53:25.160 --> 53:26.828
that our phones were tapped.

53:26.912 --> 53:29.956
He started to get very paranoid.

53:33.293 --> 53:36.254
[Keith]
These people were constantly watching us.

53:36.963 --> 53:38.590
I'm running the damn thing,

53:38.673 --> 53:40.842
so I might be number one
on their hit list.

53:42.385 --> 53:45.722
So, I said to Randy,
"This ain't working. I mean, I'm done."

53:48.183 --> 53:50.727
[Randy] Keith was a brilliant crew chief.

53:51.937 --> 53:55.398
When I lost him,
the team kind of fell apart.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.401
[comm]
The 57 car has got a technical problem.

53:58.485 --> 54:01.488
Randy Lanier out of Florida
wasn't really running up

54:01.571 --> 54:03.281
near the front of the race at any time.

54:04.115 --> 54:06.785
[Randy]
So, I went and got more experience.

54:08.620 --> 54:12.165
[Pam] He would go out of town racing,
and wouldn't be around.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.877
It was difficult on Brandy and I.

54:17.462 --> 54:21.508
[comm] Finally, in row number 14,
Randy Lanier in 57…

54:21.591 --> 54:27.555
I felt lonely at times,
and I sought out drugs, I guess, to…

54:28.598 --> 54:31.184
ease my pain, ease my loneliness.

54:36.189 --> 54:37.732
[Randy] I come home one evening,

54:37.816 --> 54:42.362
and Pam and some of her friends
was, um, partying.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.072
And as soon as I open the door,

54:44.656 --> 54:47.826
I could smell a different smell
in the house.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.786
Somebody was smoking cocaine.

54:50.328 --> 54:54.666
And he said if I didn't get help
that he was gonna take Brandy from me.

54:55.750 --> 54:56.835
And, um…

54:58.461 --> 55:00.171
she went to rehab the next day.

55:04.634 --> 55:07.262
[Pam] I stayed
in that treatment center for 30 days.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.347
I got clean.

55:10.932 --> 55:15.020
And that's when I started
seeing things clearer.

55:22.652 --> 55:24.863
And then after I got out
of that treatment center,

55:24.946 --> 55:27.157
a month later,
I got pregnant with our son.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.493
I approached Randy with…

55:31.911 --> 55:33.121
you're gonna be caught.

55:33.204 --> 55:36.374
You can't keep doing what you're doing
and getting away with it.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.793
Please, get out
for our children's sake.

55:39.753 --> 55:42.505
And that's when he said to me, "I can't."

55:42.589 --> 55:45.967
"It's like shooting heroine in my veins,
I am addicted."

55:46.468 --> 55:49.095
He was addicted to racing cars.

55:51.264 --> 55:55.143
And he had to continue smuggling drugs
to support his racing habit.

55:59.606 --> 56:01.816
[Randy]
I already had another load planned.

56:02.317 --> 56:04.569
A bigger load than the last load.

56:05.070 --> 56:08.615
Over 50-million dollars of merchandise.

56:10.075 --> 56:13.620
Probably the largest load of grass
ever brought into the United States.

56:15.080 --> 56:19.542
And it was ten days
from coming ashore in Louisiana.

56:25.006 --> 56:27.717
And my gate bell rings.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.143
It's a fellow I know from Louisiana.

56:40.271 --> 56:43.066
He's come to tell me some bad news.

56:43.149 --> 56:44.859
His brother had gotten arrested,

56:45.735 --> 56:46.986
and he's cooperating.

56:49.322 --> 56:53.451
His brother knew a lot about the operation
because he's from Louisiana.

56:55.703 --> 56:58.915
He might know
exactly where this barge is coming into.

57:00.542 --> 57:04.045
I'm thinking, "Holy shit.
What am I gonna do now?"

57:05.672 --> 57:08.800
I call my partners, I tell them
we've got some major problems.

57:08.883 --> 57:12.929
We can't bring the load into Louisiana.
They know the load is coming.

57:14.264 --> 57:18.476
But there's no way we cannot do this.
The Colombians are expecting

57:18.560 --> 57:19.894
this load to come in.

57:20.979 --> 57:24.899
I don't want a dozen Colombians
showing up at my house with guns.

57:26.067 --> 57:28.111
We've got to find a backup spot.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.989
I thought, wait a minute.

57:31.531 --> 57:36.619
The FBI, the DEA,
they would never know that we know.

57:37.328 --> 57:41.332
So, by them not knowing that we know,
we can take the barge,

57:41.416 --> 57:43.293
put in on the Pacific Coast…

57:44.586 --> 57:47.046
they'll be looking for it in Louisiana.

57:48.131 --> 57:50.633
So, we found a spot in San Francisco.

57:51.468 --> 57:55.346
The barge has got to go
back through the Panama Canal

57:55.847 --> 57:59.434
to the Pacific Ocean, and all the way up
to Northern California.

58:00.101 --> 58:01.769
It's gonna take about six months.

58:02.145 --> 58:05.064
If we get up out of this,
then damn sure, I'm done with it.

58:06.107 --> 58:08.234
This was definitely my last load.

1:07:44.518 --> 1:07:45.895

1:07:51.984 --> 1:07:53.235
What should I do?

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:58.866
Should I just turn myself in
and try to face the fact?

1:08:00.868 --> 1:08:02.787
But then, what good would that do,

1:08:02.870 --> 1:08:05.331
getting a life sentence
and being in prison?

1:08:06.874 --> 1:08:12.546
I could do more helpful things
for my family if I was a fugitive.

towards the end of my pregnancy

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:20.346
and got an apartment in Miami.

1:08:21.055 --> 1:08:24.934
He told me if we got divorced
he would sign me over the mansion,

1:08:25.559 --> 1:08:27.478
and that nobody could take it from me.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:34.360
[Randy] Meanwhile, I took some precautions
and I buried some money, $3,000,000.

1:08:35.653 --> 1:08:38.906
And I had my dad bury it
at his property in Virginia.

1:08:40.866 --> 1:08:44.036
The plan really was to disappear.

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:51.001
So, he needed to assume another identity,
which I was very good at doing.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:54.630
Randy had got
these fake birth certificates.

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:57.633
I attempted then
to get a fake driver's license.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:02.638
So, dressed like I am right now,
I went in and I said,

1:09:03.472 --> 1:09:07.268
"I've had a robbery at my house,
I've lost all my identification,

1:09:07.351 --> 1:09:10.146
the only thing I have
is a copy of my birth certificate."

1:09:10.229 --> 1:09:14.275
"Is that enough to get me
a Florida driver's license?"

1:09:14.817 --> 1:09:17.069
And, she looked at it she goes, "Yeah."

1:09:17.153 --> 1:09:18.362
So, I'm thinking…

1:09:20.114 --> 1:09:21.949
Perfect. Piece of cake.

1:09:22.867 --> 1:09:26.495
I sat in the chairs waiting for my name
to be called for the license…

1:09:28.330 --> 1:09:29.498

And at this point,
I just broke out into a sweat.

And he says, "I don't think this is real."

1:09:45.848 --> 1:09:49.768
And, uh, so they arrest me.

1:09:51.353 --> 1:09:56.775
But in the car that I drove that day,
I had a briefcase.

1:09:57.359 --> 1:09:58.569
And in that briefcase,

1:09:59.069 --> 1:10:02.573
was the abbreviated notes…

1:10:03.991 --> 1:10:06.243
of the money that I had collected
up to that point.

the FBI and the DEA

I did not tell them where he was

1:22:04.252 --> 1:22:05.670
we cook dinner at home.

1:22:06.630 --> 1:22:09.758
He drives me crazy sometimes,
but I love him.

1:22:11.509 --> 1:22:15.263
I'm looking forward
to, uh, living my life out with her.

1:22:16.139 --> 1:22:17.140
Pretty awesome.

1:22:21.311 --> 1:22:23.647
[Pam] So, how long's it been
since you've seen him?

1:22:24.147 --> 1:22:26.066
[Randy] He testified in '88.

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:28.360
-[Pam] Man!
-Thirty-one years ago.

1:22:33.531 --> 1:22:35.533
-[Randy] Hey!
-[Charles] Hello!

1:22:35.617 --> 1:22:36.743
Come here.

1:22:36.826 --> 1:22:39.037
God. How's it going, bro?

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:41.206
That's a hug waiting 30 years.

1:22:42.082 --> 1:22:44.334
-Yeah, 31. No.
-You ain't grown none.

1:22:44.417 --> 1:22:45.627
[Charles laughs]

1:22:45.710 --> 1:22:48.755
You honor our home.
And I thank you so much for that.

1:22:48.838 --> 1:22:52.842
-It's fucking amazing to fucking see you.
-I know.

1:22:54.135 --> 1:22:59.516
I know that this journey that we're on
is a short-lived journey.

1:23:00.016 --> 1:23:00.976
For real.

1:23:01.935 --> 1:23:03.353
Decades can go by.

1:23:04.604 --> 1:23:08.817
And it took me years to understand
that for me to have…

1:23:10.568 --> 1:23:15.865
freedom within a confinement of a prison,
I had to have forgiveness.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:19.202
I remember some of the meals
we used to go to--

1:23:19.285 --> 1:23:20.745
Yeah. I remember when we used to

1:23:20.829 --> 1:23:22.580
take over the restaurant
in Fort Lauderdale

1:23:22.664 --> 1:23:25.792
-and had big parties upstairs. 
-Which one? The French restaurant?

1:23:25.875 --> 1:23:29.879
-The French restaurant, yeah.
-Well, after we did a load, huh?

1:23:29.963 --> 1:23:31.715
[both laugh]

1:23:31.798 --> 1:23:33.883
-The party was on.
-The party was on.

1:23:34.467 --> 1:23:37.762
[Randy] But I've come to understand that
they're not the ones who put me in prison.

1:23:37.846 --> 1:23:40.473
I put myself in it through my actions.

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:41.766
[Charles] Thank you, darling.

1:23:42.434 --> 1:23:45.145
-You are-- He's a keeper.
-[Randy laughs]

1:23:45.228 --> 1:23:49.232
Anybody that puts up with me
is a keeper, you know what I mean?

1:23:49.315 --> 1:23:50.483
[laughs]

1:23:50.567 --> 1:23:53.570
He's gonna kill me later, okay?
I just want you to know.

1:23:53.653 --> 1:23:55.655
[Randy] I wanna tell you something else.

1:23:56.656 --> 1:23:58.825
If you live
with forgiveness and gratitude,

1:23:59.909 --> 1:24:02.537
your life will open up in so many ways.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:05.373
Greed…

1:24:07.042 --> 1:24:08.501
is a bad thing.

1:24:08.585 --> 1:24:11.379
And it can lead you
to make some bad decisions.

1:24:15.842 --> 1:24:17.260
And I was a greedy fuck.

1:24:20.263 --> 1:24:22.265
