"High on the Ceiling" plays)

00:20.120 --> 00:22.111
*

00:29.790 --> 00:32.054
Please, right here.

00:36.430 --> 00:39.467
* I read all your mail

00:40.670 --> 00:43.639
* I searched all your clothes

00:43.670 --> 00:47.777
* And I had you tracked

00:47.810 --> 00:51.701
* When you left home

00:51.750 --> 00:53.115
Here.

00:53.150 --> 00:57.484
* I watched all your tapes

00:57.520 --> 01:00.785
* Went through
all your magazines... *

01:02.830 --> 01:04.786
(clears throat)

01:04.830 --> 01:06.821
(laughs softly)

01:09.730 --> 01:11.288
Well, we could do mime.

01:11.330 --> 01:13.560
(laughs)

01:13.600 --> 01:15.591
Uh, they can't take
all of us, can they?

01:15.640 --> 01:18.268
No. Five percent.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.369
Any, uh, suggestions

01:20.410 --> 01:21.331
for getting out of jury duty?

01:21.380 --> 01:23.245
Yeah. Tell them you're a lawyer.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.178
Oh, do I have to?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.314
I'm Daniel by the way.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.409
Alicia.

01:28.450 --> 01:31.146
So, what do you do, Alicia?

01:31.190 --> 01:32.509
I'm a lawyer.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.255
Oops.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.688
Bad experience with lavwers?

01:37.730 --> 01:39.857
Uh... ex-wife.
(cell phone rings)

01:39.900 --> 01:41.891
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.420
Hello?
ELI: Where are you?

01:43.470 --> 01:45.768
You're not at work.
Nice to talk to you, too, Eli.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.199
I'm at jury duty. What's up?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.764
They put you on a jury?

01:48.800 --> 01:51.200
What's up, Eli?
You're friend Finn,

01:52.510 --> 01:53.579
he's losing.

01:53.610 --> 01:54.736
How can he be losing?

01:54.780 --> 01:56.600
The campaign hasn't
even started yet.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.402
Alicia, the campaign started
when Peter vouched for him.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.179
He needs to win.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.279
His competition Castro is
out there getting endorsements.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.719
People don't know who Finn is.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.149
Who's his campaign manager?

02:05.190 --> 02:06.282
He doesn't have one.
Well, he needs one.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.309
Coffee!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.282
(sighs)
I've set up...

02:09.330 --> 02:11.924
No! An interview with WEQT

02:11.960 --> 02:13.359
to introduce him.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.799
Talk to him, Alicia.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.219
Uh, no, thank you, Eli.
They're calling me in now.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.191
No one's calling you in.

02:18.230 --> 02:19.629
Here they are. Bye.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.662
(groans)

02:22.710 --> 02:24.462
(cell phone rings)
Finn.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.637
This is Eli Gold calling
from the governor's office.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.568
Yes, Mr. Gold, hello.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.202
Look, I'm a little busy.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.877
I set up an interview
for today.

02:31.910 --> 02:34.276
A local station, WEQT,
at 6:00 pm.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.345
Excuse me_?
You're running
for state's attorney.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.346
I set up a TV interview.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.880
Be ready at 2:00.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.478
You said 6:00.
The interview's at 6:00.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.748
My prep is at 2:00.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.280
It'll take an hour.
Come by my office...

02:44.330 --> 02:45.649
I'll call you back.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.328
Ms. Lockhart?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.588
Uh, Finn Polmar.

02:48.630 --> 02:50.791
Oh, yes.
So, where can we do this?

02:50.830 --> 02:53.264
Where can_ we...?
The questioning.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.631
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.739
Your firm invited us
to conduct

02:55.770 --> 02:56.862
the Pollard questioning here.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.332
So we're here.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.837
I, uh, I...

02:59.880 --> 03:01.939
Could you give me one second?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.907
Actually, uh, come with me.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.770
Please.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.709
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:10.750 --> 03:11.717
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:11.750 --> 03:12.557
I have an ASA

03:12.590 --> 03:14.512
and three policeman
waiting for me?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.619
Oh, yeah, that would
be for the Pollards.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.457
Lyle Pollard?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.957
He called this morning.
He said that, uh,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.797
that the police
were at his home,

03:21.830 --> 03:23.263
wanted to speak to his grandson.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.892
Kid was out,
so I suggested

03:24.930 --> 03:27.398
he tell them to meet here, and
we'd supervise the questioning.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.429
Regarding?

03:28.470 --> 03:29.505
What?
The-the questions

03:29.540 --> 03:30.905
are regarding...?

03:30.940 --> 03:32.476
Oh, uh, I have no idea.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.972
Mr. Canning.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.773
Why are you talking
to my clients?

03:38.810 --> 03:41.711
Well, your assistant
couldn't find you this morning.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.685
Uh, and she said it was
an important client.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.449
So I just took it.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.958
I mean, next time I won't
if you don't want me to.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.855
Let me think about that.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.448
WOMAN:
Juror 68?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.354
You are excused,
also Juror 72...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.389
You look familiar, Alicia.

03:55.430 --> 03:56.624
Why do you look familiar?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.298
I don't know. I have
one of those faces.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.434
_ MAN:
First row up.
Fill the empty seats, please.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.437
(sighs)

04:03.470 --> 04:05.938
Could I get in trouble
ifI said I was a lawyer?

04:05.970 --> 04:07.801
Uh, if you're lying, you will.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.649
Oh, so probably shouldn't.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.443
Depends on your taste
for adventure.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.879
MAN:
No cell phone use.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.342
(elevator bell dings)

04:14.380 --> 04:16.848
Oh, Diane, thank God!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.039
Is he here?

04:18.090 --> 04:20.308
Robbie? No, not yet.
What happened?

04:20.360 --> 04:21.782
They say he's selling pot.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.482
Can you believe
Robbie's selling pot?

04:24.530 --> 04:26.350
Do you know why all the police?
Yeah, sure.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.799
You know why.

04:27.830 --> 04:28.990
They're still after me

04:29.030 --> 04:31.328
for the work I did
in the '68 convention.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.361
They drive by the
house every day.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.628
Oh, here he is. Robbie.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.501
Don't worry, I just
went to the bathroom.

04:36.540 --> 04:37.564
What's up?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.601
We need to talk.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.809
DIANE:
Uh, just to be clear.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.546
I am allowing my client
to answer a limited number

04:46.580 --> 04:49.583
of questions to aid
your investigation

04:49.620 --> 04:51.747
as long as the conversation
is proffer-protected.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.611
It is. Thank you.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.651
Do you know
what Silk Road is, Robbie?

04:56.690 --> 04:57.850
A black market site?

04:57.890 --> 04:59.596
Yeah, it's a marketplace

04:59.630 --> 05:02.667
for the sale of drugs.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.419
Marijuana, cocaine, MDA,

05:05.470 --> 05:07.097
heroin, assault weapons

05:07.140 --> 05:10.405
and even murder.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.533
What Amazon is to book clubbers,

05:12.580 --> 05:15.378
Silk Road is to criminals.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.479
Have you ever logged into it?

05:16.510 --> 05:17.499
No.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.370
Not even to peruse it?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.012
He already said no!
Well, $1.2 billion

05:21.050 --> 05:24.440
in legal goods are bought
and sold on Silk Road.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.458
Now, that makes it
a class one felony

05:26.490 --> 05:28.515
for anyone involved
in running the site.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.380
I'm not hearing a
lot of questions,

05:30.430 --> 05:31.385
Mr. Polmar.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.921
We traced money

05:33.960 --> 05:35.518
from Silk Road
to your computer, Robbie.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.391
You traced money? What money?

05:37.430 --> 05:40.433
65 Bitcoin
worth approximately $39,000.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.735
We found it deposited
in Robbie's digital wallet.

05:43.770 --> 05:46.409
I've never bought anything
or sold anything on Silk Road.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.600
The money that we traced

05:47.640 --> 05:50.575
was to an employee.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.477
You're an employee of Silk Road.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.771
LYLE:
Robbie's in college.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.071
He's graduating in May.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.678
He's writing his thesis
for God's sake.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.518
We've worked with Bitcoin
before, Mr. Polmar.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.551
It's an anonymous currency.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.455
You can't trace it.
Oh, you couldn't.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.923
Until Mt. Gox was bankrupted.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.598
The Bitcoin exchange.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.495
Then law enforcement
was suddenly allowed

06:09.530 --> 06:11.623
access to the servers,
which meant that we could trace

06:11.670 --> 06:13.558
the Bitcoin to
Robbie's computer.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.431
Now, a class one
felony, Robbie?

06:15.470 --> 06:16.607
Four years

06:16.640 --> 06:18.767
to 15 years in prison.

06:18.810 --> 06:19.970
Mr. Polmar,
let's talk in private.

06:20.010 --> 06:22.478
Shall we?
Yeah.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.487
Mr. Canning,
do you have a minute?

06:33.020 --> 06:35.784
Why aren't you
arresting him?

06:35.820 --> 06:38.152
I want to know
what he knows.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.748
So, you're looking
for a plea?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.926
Yeah.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.791
Yeah, one year of jail time
for getting us

06:42.830 --> 06:46.630
to the top dog at Silk Road.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.559
And yet, you're
questioning him here

06:49.610 --> 06:50.804
and not at_ the
police station?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.000
That's true.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.008
You didn't want to be
seen strong-arming

06:54.040 --> 06:56.201
a kid with cerebral palsy?

06:56.240 --> 06:58.743
Oh, come on.
Especially one who was
an attorney like...

06:58.780 --> 07:00.008
Louis Canning.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.177
Hello, I'm Louis Canning.

07:02.220 --> 07:03.847
Nice to meet you.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.517
Uh, this is
ASA Polmar.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.814
Uh, why don't you, uh,

07:07.860 --> 07:10.454
describe your disorder,
Mr. Canning?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.050
Yeah, it's, uh,
tardive dyskinesia.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.499
It's a neurological disorder...

07:14.530 --> 07:16.623
Which plays
well on camera.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.626
Especially if he has
a client with cerebral palsy.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.490
Your client's involved
In one of the biggest

07:20.540 --> 07:21.996
criminal conspiracies
of the let century.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.463
All you have is a few Bitcoin...

07:24.510 --> 07:26.159
And you're running for
state's attorney, aren't you?

07:26.210 --> 07:27.632
POLMAR:
What does that have
to do with this?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.079
Well, you wouldn't want
to be seen

07:29.110 --> 07:30.805
falsely accusing
another young man.

07:30.850 --> 07:31.908
Especially since

07:31.950 --> 07:33.577
your last wrongful prosecution

07:33.620 --> 07:35.713
resulted in the death
of an attorney

07:35.750 --> 07:37.081
and a witness.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.249
I have a witness.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.826
To what?
Your client

07:44.860 --> 07:46.225
participating in Silk Road.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.956
But you have another problem.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.025
Lyle Pollard.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.867
He's one of your richest
clients, isn't he?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.664
Well, Robbie worked on Silk Road
in his grandfather's basement.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.498
That means that I can freeze
his grandfather's assets.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.640
Juror 499, please
state your name.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.739
Uh, Daniel Irwin.
And your occupation.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.685
I-I design batteries.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.789
What does that entail?

08:12.820 --> 08:14.617
Uh, well, I'm, uh,

08:14.660 --> 08:16.082
I'm working
on a lithium ion battery

08:16.120 --> 08:19.226
that's 2,000 times more powerful
than current batteries.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.626
_ It's for use_
In computers and In cars.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.422
That's very impressive.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.324
Do you think
that you could judge

08:23.370 --> 08:25.895
_ this case _
of Indecent exposure faIrly?

08:25.930 --> 08:27.136
I-I don't, uh, know.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.730
I have friends who...
friends who are lavwers,

08:29.770 --> 08:32.307
and that might influence me.

08:32.340 --> 08:35.207
The Defense has no objections
to this juror,

08:35.240 --> 08:36.901
Your Honor.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.714
Juror 503,
please state your name.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.218
Alicia Florrick.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.945
I see. Uh, you are
the governor's wife.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.218
Iam.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.649
And you're a lawyer.

08:46.690 --> 08:47.679
Yes.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.620
Well, it was very nice
to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.685
Uh, the Defense would like

08:51.730 --> 08:53.721
_ to exercise
Its preemptory challenge.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.227
MAN:
Okay, the juror is excused.
Thank you.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.921
Well, it was
very nice to meet you.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.619
Well, next time
I'll say I'm a lawyer.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.661
Good luck.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.638
That's it, I'm done.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.331
No more jury duty.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.201
Ah, that was easy.
Yeah.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.605
I'm coming in.
I'll see you in a few minutes.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.675
Nope.
What do you mean?

09:11.710 --> 09:13.610
You're not coming in.
How am I not coming in?

09:16.650 --> 09:18.140
(laughs)
Cary, thanks.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.750
ButI have a lot...
No, you don't.

09:20.790 --> 09:21.916
Seriously, how many days
have you had off

09:21.960 --> 09:23.188
in the last five years?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.255
I don't know.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.359
I do.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.755
The same as me-- none.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.597
So today is your day off.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.961
This is my gift to you.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.638
Take it.

09:32.670 --> 09:33.796
(sighs)

09:33.840 --> 09:35.990
Thanks, Cary.
You're a good man.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.701
Nah, I'm a good partner.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.105
Okay, I'm taking the day off.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.279
This is me taking
the day off.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.005
I didn't do it.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.074
DIANE:
I know,

09:44.110 --> 09:46.613
but how did this Bitcoin end up

09:46.650 --> 09:47.617
on your computer?

09:47.650 --> 09:49.311
They use zombie computers.
Maybe it was that?

09:49.350 --> 09:50.715
He's been busy

09:50.750 --> 09:52.012
doing his graduate work.
He's had no time...

09:52.050 --> 09:53.381
Lyle, could you
give us a minute?

09:53.420 --> 09:54.614
W-W-What do you mean?

09:54.660 --> 09:55.786
Could you step out
for a minute?

09:55.820 --> 09:56.718
Why?!

09:56.760 --> 09:57.829
I'll come and get you.
Please?

10:04.870 --> 10:07.839
They say they have
a witness, Robbie.

10:07.870 --> 10:09.360
How could they have a witness?

10:14.940 --> 10:17.738
Lyle, wait in reception, please.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.747
He's innocent.

10:18.780 --> 10:19.815
This is about the cops.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.249
I know. Reception.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.745
Kalinda, do you have a minute?

10:23.790 --> 10:24.609
Sure.

10:24.650 --> 10:27.813
CANNING:
Look, everybody wants to rebel.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.829
I mean, for me in-in college

10:30.860 --> 10:32.748
it-it was girls.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.859
The key is to not let it affect

10:34.900 --> 10:36.925
the rest of your life.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.790
Everybody wants a clean slate.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.889
This is a chance
to make this yours.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.191
So, tell us.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.663
We-we'll find a way
to tell your grandfather.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.859
He will understand.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.309
Believe me, I promise you.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.816
I wrote reviews for them.

10:53.850 --> 10:56.341
For Silk Road?

10:56.380 --> 10:59.087
Yeah.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.816
They wanted some business.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.454
They paid me
to write client reviews

11:04.490 --> 11:05.889
to get more sales moving.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.227
Right. But you didn't sample
the product.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.455
No, they-they weren't
real reviews.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.319
They were just planted.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.739
You know, "great high,
fast delivery."

11:14.770 --> 11:18.262
I created a ratings system
for the quality of the high:

11:18.310 --> 11:20.904
"Five William S. Burroughs."

11:20.940 --> 11:22.771
It was all a joke.
That's what

11:22.810 --> 11:23.902
you were paid for?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.076
Yeah.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.407
(sighs)
What?

11:26.450 --> 11:28.372
I never did anything.
I just wrote reviews.

11:28.420 --> 11:33.187
But you abetted $1.2 billion
in drug sales.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.778
It makes you
an accessory.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.185
KALIN DA:
Who paid you?

11:36.220 --> 11:37.881
Uh, this is
our investigator.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.727
Hi.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.829
I don't know.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.259
It was all done anonymously.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.860
They say they have a witness,
Robbie.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.128
Who can that be?

11:46.170 --> 11:47.467
I don't know.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.937
What?

11:50.970 --> 11:53.768
There was this girl.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.404
I was just talking
to her near school.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.107
I offered to write her a review

11:59.150 --> 12:01.846
if she ever got on Silk Road
to sell anything.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.110
And what was her name?

12:04.150 --> 12:08.780
Hi, uh, Corsica.
Sorry to interrupt you.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.152
Yeah, come on in.
I've got two new types.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.055
Northern Lights,
8-52 on the coffee table.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.328
Nice.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.351
Yeah, uh-huh.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.532
No, not tonight.
But look, someone's here.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.458
I'll call you back, okay?

12:24.870 --> 12:26.360
So, what are you looking for?

12:26.410 --> 12:27.877
Actually,

12:27.910 --> 12:29.901
I'm looking for information
on Robbie Pollard.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.869
I have nothing to say.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.716
I think you already had

12:34.750 --> 12:36.217
something to say...
to the police.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.081
_ You're not
In any danger.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.089
I just want to know
what you told the police.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.023
They were gonna arrest me.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.153
All I did was give his name.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.553
Did you give any other names?

12:48.600 --> 12:53.890
No, I've never met anyone else
from Silk Road.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.293
I told them Robbie offered

12:55.340 --> 12:57.137
to write me a review,
that's all.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.865
I didn't tell them everything.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.901
What do you mean
by "everything"?

13:00.940 --> 13:02.976
You know...

13:05.050 --> 13:09.009
That Robbie invented Silk Road.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.097
Look, I told Corsica
I invented Silk Road,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.165
but I didn't know
she'd believe me.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.829
I just said it. I was just...

13:32.880 --> 13:36.941
She was pretty,
and I was trying to impress her.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.174
Well, she believed you.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.973
But she didn't call
the police.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.079
KALINDA: No. She said she was
worried that Robbie

13:42.120 --> 13:43.610
would hurt her.
That I would?

13:43.650 --> 13:46.244
She said that you were
in charge of Silk Road,

13:46.290 --> 13:47.985
it was your invention

13:48.020 --> 13:50.181
and that you had $100 million

13:50.230 --> 13:52.255
in Bitcoin hidden away
in Iceland.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.326
Robbie, if you aren't
in charge of Silk Road...

13:54.360 --> 13:55.156
I'm not. I...

13:55.200 --> 13:57.259
...then you have got
to give the ASA

13:57.300 --> 13:59.291
something he can use.
Do you have anything

13:59.330 --> 14:01.264
that would lead
to someone hIgher up?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.392
No, it was all anonymous.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.964
How did they contact you,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.363
the leaders
of Silk Road?

14:05.410 --> 14:06.638
Through e-mail.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.900
But it was over TOR,
everything encrypted.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.874
You show me?

14:10.910 --> 14:13.219
I have to do_ _
the v0Ice-recognItIon.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.117
It's programmed
for my dysarthria.

14:16.150 --> 14:18.448
Computer, launch TOR.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.881
Go to Cloak and Veil.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.025
Where are we, Diane?

14:25.060 --> 14:26.459
Without committing
ourselves,

14:26.490 --> 14:28.629
we might be willing
to make a deal.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.265
Good. We want
the guy who runs it.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.167
We're trying
to work on that now.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.679
Roger, hi.
Thank you for the flowers.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.678
No, I wanted to thank you.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.917
Great work.
Some of your best yet.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.418
Thank you. I'm just, uh...

14:51.450 --> 14:52.951
Which work are we talking about?

14:52.990 --> 14:55.311
(chuckles)
Listen to you! So humble.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.079
The business plan.
Talk about going the extra mile.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.951
Well, I-I-I'm glad you're happy.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.528
So, um, Roger, I don't remember
you asking me to do this work.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.697
Um, when did you call?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.298
About a month ago.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.932
Did we talk?

15:10.970 --> 15:12.301
No, you were out.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.205
Your assistant sent me on to...

15:14.240 --> 15:15.434
Louis Canning?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.141
No, David something.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.169
Oh, David Lee.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.041
Yeah, that's it. Funny guy.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.945
He said he'd give you
the message.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.119
Well, anyway, thank you so much.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.569
(knocking on glass)

15:40.140 --> 15:43.007
Pauline, you can go home now.
You're fired.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.071
The e-mails
are anonymous,

15:51.110 --> 15:53.476
but there is a message
at the bottom of each of them:

15:53.520 --> 15:55.476
"Prepare to be amazed."
It's a signature of some kind.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.714
You're seeing

15:56.750 --> 15:59.082
if you can find it
anywhere else on the Web?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.189
Yeah, somewhere unprotected.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.984
Good. I need something else.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.249
You said you could
help me when I needed it.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.161
Could you find out if moves
are being made against me?

16:11.200 --> 16:12.224
Moves?

16:12.270 --> 16:13.396
It might be nothing,

16:13.440 --> 16:16.694
but my assistant was sending
client calls

16:16.740 --> 16:18.230
on to Canning and David Lee.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.170
Well, that sounds
like something.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.029
Yes, it does.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.173
But I want to know what
before I act.

16:23.210 --> 16:26.077
Good.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.510
You seem... different, Diane.

16:28.550 --> 16:31.018
Different? I do?

16:31.050 --> 16:32.642
Different good or different bad?

16:32.690 --> 16:33.714
Different good.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.459
Kalinda, I feel like
I'm channeling Will's ghost.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.355
Well, then take care of him.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.588
(clicking)

16:55.680 --> 16:57.204
What's next, Zach?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.445
Pull out the wire furthest
to the right.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.243
Not the high one, the low one.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.113
That's closest
to the blue light.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.788
What blue light?

17:05.820 --> 17:07.253
Is the TV on?

17:07.290 --> 17:08.552
Yes.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.080
Okay, so click the remote
on and off,

17:10.130 --> 17:12.018
and you should see a blue light.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.492
No, nothing's happening.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.054
Mom, which remote are you using?

17:16.100 --> 17:18.068
The silver one.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.068
No, use the other one.

17:21.740 --> 17:22.695
Which one?

17:22.740 --> 17:23.832
The black one.

17:23.870 --> 17:24.700
Zach, they're all black.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.129
The black one
with a million buttons.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.209
(loud music plays)

17:35.780 --> 17:36.815
(music stops)

17:43.390 --> 17:45.449
(fanfare plays)

18:16.720 --> 18:18.722
(mechanical whirring)

18:20.430 --> 18:22.318
No, no, no, no.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.169
Cary, I just need
to get something.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.622
What?

18:25.670 --> 18:27.297
My scarf and my laptop.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.159
Stay here.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.135
Kim, can you get
Mrs. Florrick's scarf?

18:31.170 --> 18:32.239
And my laptop!

18:32.270 --> 18:33.669
NoI
Cary?!

18:33.710 --> 18:35.769
You'll just work,
and you're not supposed to work.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.599
How's the Gower suit?

18:38.650 --> 18:40.345
It's good.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.369
They paying?

18:41.420 --> 18:44.139
I'll tell you
tomorrow. Okay!

18:44.190 --> 18:46.818
Go have fun.
(sighs)

18:50.760 --> 18:51.886
(phone rings)

18:51.930 --> 18:54.854
Hello. Oh, hey, Mom.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.266
Lunch. Um, actually,
I'm a bit busy today.

18:57.300 --> 19:01.589
Yeah. No, maybe another time.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.268
Okay, good talking to you, too.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.632
Mom? Mom, Mom,
are you still there?

19:07.680 --> 19:12.242
You know, actually,
Ithink I can make it.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.647
No. Uh, something
just dropped through.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.911
Good. I'll see you there.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.658
Wow, you really are bored.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.620
Alicia.

19:27.660 --> 19:28.820
I'm so sorry.

19:28.860 --> 19:29.849
Thank you, Mom.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.390
Will was such
a speCIal person.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.920
He made me laugh.
Thank you.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.234
Do you want me
to shut up?

19:35.270 --> 19:36.032
No. What do you mean?

19:36.070 --> 19:37.731
Oh, the way
you said thank you.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.658
After your father died,
at one point,

19:39.710 --> 19:41.337
I was just all cried out,

19:41.380 --> 19:44.406
and I just wanted
people to shut up.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.645
No, it's-it's just...

19:46.680 --> 19:47.942
Come on.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.379
Sit down.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.408
It's just what?

19:53.460 --> 19:54.813
(sighs)

19:54.860 --> 19:56.816
It's unreal.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.749
Like he's...

19:59.790 --> 20:02.588
like he's still there,
you know?

20:02.630 --> 20:05.861
Or... that he was never
there at all.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.460
I know.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.263
That's the worst part,

20:10.310 --> 20:11.959
When you can't remember
what they look like.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.898
The thing to do is pray.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.476
Pray?
Yeah.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.000
Talk to him.
Talk to Will.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.339
He'll listen.
He may not answer, but...

20:20.380 --> 20:22.848
There'll be things
in the middle of the day

20:22.880 --> 20:25.849
that seem like
he's answerIng, you know?

20:25.890 --> 20:27.517
A balloon in the slq,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.256
a leaf falling
from a tree.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.826
I don't know what I'm doing
with my life, Mom.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.758
Just working
seems pointless.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.892
You're smart.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.669
You're gonna
figure it out.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.362
I don't know if I want
to be a lawyer anymore.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.604
Then what are
you gonna be?

20:46.640 --> 20:47.937
I don't know.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.039
It's not about
what I want to be, it's...

20:50.080 --> 20:51.809
I don't know ifI can...

20:51.850 --> 20:53.442
MAN: _
Hey! There you are, VeronIca!

20:53.480 --> 20:55.448
Hi.
I thought we said 1:30?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.742
I got off
early, so...
Oh.

20:56.780 --> 20:58.509
Hi. Logan.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.847
This is my
daughter, Alicia.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.687
Logan wanted to join us
for lunch.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.051
You look beautiful.
Oh! (laughs)
Come on!

21:03.090 --> 21:04.682
Actually, I have to get
back to work.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.823
I got a text
and I'm a little late.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.849
No, no, no, stay, stay.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.821
No, they need me
at work, Mom.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.418
Nice to meet you, Logan.
What are you doing?

21:10.470 --> 21:11.767
You, too.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.601
(couple conversing indistinctly)

21:21.780 --> 21:23.805
(Anya Marina's
"High on the Ceiling" plays)

21:34.990 --> 21:36.878
What's wrong with you?

21:38.830 --> 21:39.922
Oh, God.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.749
Alicia Florrick.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.462
I thought that was you.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.626
Hey.

21:46.670 --> 21:47.762
Did you get on another jury?

21:47.800 --> 21:51.964
No, I just, um, I thought
I left something in court.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.500
My wallet.

21:53.540 --> 21:54.973
Oh. Did you find it?

21:55.010 --> 21:56.773
No, uh, not yet.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.971
I-I might-might
have left it at work.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.019
Well, you want to hit lunch?

22:02.050 --> 22:03.711
90 minutes.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.487
He's worried about
what you think of him.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.784
Did he do these
reviews for money?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.821
And the adventure.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.358
He's a good boy.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.958
He's very
embarrassed.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.093
And if he turns
on these...

22:20.130 --> 22:21.893
these Silk
Road people,

22:21.940 --> 22:23.430
will he be
in danger?

22:23.470 --> 22:24.937
The police
don't think so.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.370
These buyers and
sellers on the Internet

22:27.410 --> 22:28.672
tend to be
pretty Innocuous.

22:28.710 --> 22:29.870
Hmm.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.605
You'll keep him safe.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.844
(knocking at door, door opens)

22:32.880 --> 22:33.915
Diane, can we talk?

22:34.980 --> 22:36.811
I'll try.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.457
You fired Pauline.

22:44.490 --> 22:45.957
My assistant?
Yes. Why?

22:45.990 --> 22:47.651
She wasn't doing anything wrong.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.951
What are we talking about here?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.592
She sent your
client calls on to me

22:50.630 --> 22:51.722
because I asked her to.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.761
I also asked her
not to tell you.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.097
And why did you do that, David?

22:56.140 --> 22:57.437
You've been missing things

22:57.470 --> 22:58.437
since Will died.

22:58.470 --> 23:00.165
You have been missing meetings,

23:00.210 --> 23:01.700
uh, you haven't been
returning calls,

23:01.740 --> 23:03.674
clients are starting
to comment.

23:03.710 --> 23:04.677
Which clients?
Uh, you've
been

23:04.710 --> 23:05.904
coming in later,

23:05.950 --> 23:07.417
people are saying
you're not answering

23:07.450 --> 23:08.610
your cell...
Which clients?

23:08.650 --> 23:09.947
Roger Lux.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.789
Vito Conning.
I-I did it

23:11.820 --> 23:12.809
as a favor, Diane.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.683
I-I wasn't trying
to horn in on your business.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.551
I did this work
without any credit.

23:17.590 --> 23:18.818
_I-I-I said
It was you.

23:18.860 --> 23:19.827
Thank you, David.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.521
Okay.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.460
It's the last nice thing I do.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.967
From now on,
take up your own slack.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.663
KALINDA:
Here and here. See?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.860
The sender from Silk
Road had a phrase:

23:32.910 --> 23:34.935
"Prepare to
be amazed."

23:34.980 --> 23:36.834
Now, we can't trace
these e-mails back,

23:36.880 --> 23:38.848
but Robbie
was hired

23:38.880 --> 23:39.972
because of his
reVIews on Amazon,

23:40.010 --> 23:42.217
and so we scanned
the reVIews

23:42.250 --> 23:43.888
and we found this.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.787
It's a review
of an Ayn Rand book,

23:46.820 --> 23:48.151
and there it is again:
"Prepare to be amazed."

23:48.190 --> 23:49.657
This one has

23:49.690 --> 23:51.021
an IP address.

23:51.060 --> 23:54.757
One year probation.
No jail time.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.949
With a conviction.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.093
Jeremy Barba.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.597
He's a local.

23:59.630 --> 24:00.665
(knocking loudly)

24:00.700 --> 24:02.736
OFFICER: _
Jeremy Barba? Po|Ice.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.465
(knocking)

24:04.510 --> 24:06.899
Mr. Barba, we have a warrant
to search your apartment.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.601
(indistinct radio chatter)

24:18.920 --> 24:19.784
(sighs)

24:19.820 --> 24:21.549
Damn it.

24:27.190 --> 24:28.452
(indistinct radio chatter)

24:32.270 --> 24:33.567
Is that him?

24:33.600 --> 24:34.635
Is that Jeremy Barba?

24:34.670 --> 24:35.637
POLMAR:
Yeah.

24:35.670 --> 24:37.706
Kalinda, why do people
let you into crime scenes?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.037
Oh, you know.

24:39.070 --> 24:41.106
Cops like me.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.131
(camera shutter clicks)

24:47.080 --> 24:48.217
How well did you know her?

24:48.250 --> 24:49.547
Corsica?

24:49.580 --> 24:51.116
She was nice to me.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.139
She named you to the police.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.612
She was in trouble.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.615
DIANE:
Robbie...

24:54.660 --> 24:55.979
we think she may be connected

24:56.020 --> 24:57.521
to this man's death.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.788
When I questioned Corsica,

24:58.830 --> 25:00.650
she said she didn't know
anybody at Silk Road,

25:00.700 --> 25:03.191
and yet her pot label
was found at the crime scene.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.198
DIANE:
They're not honoring
the plea bargain, Robbie.

25:05.230 --> 25:06.891
We need something on Corsica.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.067
KALINDA:
How many tImes
did you meet her?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.032
Just that once.

25:09.070 --> 25:10.901
And did you bring up Silk Road,
or did she?

25:10.940 --> 25:12.828
I don't remember.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.031
Now listen to me:

25:15.080 --> 25:17.674
either this_woman Corsica
Is settIng you up,

25:17.710 --> 25:19.143
or you run Silk Road.

25:19.180 --> 25:22.115
Because that's what the
po|Ice are thInkIng rIght now.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.539
So you help us,
or you go to jail.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.887
But those are
your optIons.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.182
LYLE:
Robbie, you need
to help them.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.526
I... I set up the cloud
for her computer.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.161
(both laughing)

25:44.340 --> 25:46.934
So, the governor's wife.

25:46.970 --> 25:48.073
Yep.

25:48.110 --> 25:50.078
And what's
that like?

25:50.110 --> 25:51.600
Clarifying.

25:51.650 --> 25:52.947
(both laugh)

25:52.980 --> 25:54.948
DANIEL:
Uh...

25:56.680 --> 25:57.783
Are we being too loud?

25:57.820 --> 26:00.618
No.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.150
What is that card?
Who's that for?

26:02.190 --> 26:04.078
Oh, it's, uh,
for my kid. Anthony.

26:04.130 --> 26:04.949
Oh, how old?

26:04.990 --> 26:05.957
He's 14.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.628
Well, now 15.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.218
He's amazing. He's, uh...

26:09.260 --> 26:10.898
he writes these little stories.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.637
Th-They're like
New Yorker stories.

26:13.670 --> 26:14.989
You have kids?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.132
Yeah. Two.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.001
A boy and a girl.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.065
16 and 18.
16 and 18?

26:20.110 --> 26:21.179
When'd you have 'em,
when you were 12?

26:21.210 --> 26:24.907
(laughs)

26:24.950 --> 26:26.178
Well, I'm glad
you came along, Alicia.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.349
I thought this day was
just gonna be a waste.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.018
You all right?

26:30.050 --> 26:32.314
Will you excuse me?

26:32.350 --> 26:34.352
(door closes)

26:37.830 --> 26:38.785
What's wrong with you?

26:38.830 --> 26:40.991
Just tell him you have to go.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.021
I'm so stupid.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.670
DANIEL:
Thank you.
ALICIA:
Oh, no...

26:54.710 --> 26:56.234
Oh, no. Well, no, let's...
at least split it.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.271
Let me pay.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.371
Hmm. Thought you
lost your wallet.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.912
My other wallet.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.110
(snorts)

27:11.060 --> 27:13.426
Alicia, look, I, uh...

27:13.460 --> 27:15.348
I-I don't have friends.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.789
I work a lot and I'm private,

27:17.830 --> 27:19.195
so what I'm about
to say doesn't...

27:19.230 --> 27:20.219
doesn't mean anything.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.669
I mean, anything serious.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.861
Jury duty takes me
till 6:30.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.003
I was planning on
coming back here and just

27:26.040 --> 27:27.337
getting a drink.

27:27.370 --> 27:29.076
Meet me here at 7:00.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.975
Okay? Just a drink,
nothing more.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.102
I can't.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.175
Eh, you can.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.244
I know you're married.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.918
And you have kids, and...

27:36.950 --> 27:39.089
and I'm not into getting
tangled up either,

27:39.120 --> 27:41.088
but I still want
to have a drink with you.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.155
Why?

27:42.190 --> 27:43.316
Because
I like you.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.328
Gaugh)
I think you're funny.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.851
I'd want a drink with you
if you were a man,

27:47.900 --> 27:49.197
or a chimpanzee, or...

27:51.900 --> 27:53.458
All right.
Let's leave it at this:

27:53.500 --> 27:55.229
I'm coming back
here at 7:00.

27:55.270 --> 27:56.066
They have a great
wine list.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.864
If you're here,
I'll be very happy.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.207
If you're not, I'll be

28:00.240 --> 28:02.333
less happy.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.870
Butthen,

28:03.910 --> 28:06.071
this was a nice lunch.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.875
I have to go.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.048
But your credit card--
she hasn't taken it yet.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.814
I'll pay. You go.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.125
Okay. Thanks.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.923
Remember, 7:00.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.024
I'm Finn Polmar,

28:26.070 --> 28:27.935
and I'm running for
Cook County state's attorney

28:27.970 --> 28:29.938
because I think the ofﬁce
is currently being mismanaged.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.835
In what way mismanaged?

28:31.870 --> 28:33.906
James Castro is
a good man, but...

28:33.940 --> 28:35.077
He's not a good man.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.078
What does that mean,
"a good man"?

28:37.110 --> 28:38.839
James Castro is a
frIend of mm...

28:38.880 --> 28:40.040
Nobody cares.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.445
What can you
do for me?

28:41.480 --> 28:43.448
Stop serving political interests

28:43.480 --> 28:44.811
and convict criminals.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.442
Are political
interests being served?

28:46.490 --> 28:48.856
Yes, for the past three years...
No.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.152
Governor Florrick
was state's attorney

28:50.190 --> 28:51.327
for two of
those years.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.554
But it's the truth.

28:52.590 --> 28:54.990
You're under the impression
this interview's
about the truth?

28:55.030 --> 28:57.225
For the past year,

28:57.260 --> 28:59.023
the office has been mired in...
Good.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.321
Tell me about being shot.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.769
I'm sorry. What?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.165
The interview is
to Introduce you.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.758
Tell me about being shot.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.401
I was in court.

29:10.110 --> 29:14.069
A defendant took
a sheriff's gun,

29:14.120 --> 29:15.974
killed a witness

29:16.020 --> 29:17.078
and then tried to shoot himself.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.940
And you're already back
in court, prosecuting cases?

29:18.990 --> 29:20.287
It's my job.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.288
Good.
People say you're a hero.

29:23.990 --> 29:24.922
Do we have to do this?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.985
No one_ will remember
your fIve-pomt plan.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.520
They'll remember a hero
trying to save

29:28.560 --> 29:29.527
a dying man.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.767
I... I wasn't the hero.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.963
Will Gardner was the hero.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.069
When Jeffrey Grant
started shooting,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.931
he tried to, uh, take the gun.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.130
Good. Good. Say that.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.900
That... Will was the hero?
Mmm.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.305
Humility.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.104
A hero doesn't brag,
he deflects.

29:46.150 --> 29:48.118
But he still
has to describe.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.072
People need to hear the horror.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.581
Do you have some comment
to make, Mr. Polmar?

29:54.620 --> 29:57.214
That's the reason the governor's
endorsing me, the shooting?

29:57.260 --> 29:58.852
No.
The governor's endorsing you

29:58.890 --> 30:00.926
because he doesn't like Castro.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.496
I am establishing your value

30:02.530 --> 30:04.020
through the shooting.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.368
If society valued kindness
and a good haircut,

30:06.400 --> 30:07.526
I'd establish that.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.561
(phone ringing)

30:16.610 --> 30:18.305
Hi, Diane.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.602
What do you need?

30:20.650 --> 30:21.912
Corsica?

30:21.950 --> 30:24.544
What did you
find out?

30:24.590 --> 30:27.479
I gotta go.
The interview's
at 6:00.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.851
Be on time.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.084
Yeah.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.526
What?
POLMAR:
Jeremy Barba Is dead.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.993
You know who that is?

30:40.300 --> 30:41.938
You said that you didn't know

30:41.970 --> 30:43.528
any other names
connected with Silk Road.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.401
I didn't want
to get him in trouble.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.431
What happened?

30:49.310 --> 30:50.299
He was murdered.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.171
Oh, my God.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.041
You know, there are
a lot of, uh, services

30:54.080 --> 30:56.446
sold on Silk Road.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.482
Smuggling,
kidnappIng...

30:59.650 --> 31:01.049
Also murder
for We.

31:01.090 --> 31:02.114
It was Robbie.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.025
He's trying to get rid of
anybody who can hurt him.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.220
Or you are.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.891
Recognize this?

31:08.930 --> 31:10.989
Why?

31:11.030 --> 31:13.396
And these?

31:13.430 --> 31:15.091
CORSICA:
I don't know them.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.095
These photos
were found

31:16.140 --> 31:17.539
in your cloud
account.

31:17.570 --> 31:19.367
And there was _
an encrypted e-maII

31:19.410 --> 31:20.502
to one of the hit men.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.679
Well, I'm being set up.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.246
You have to believe me.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.109
Ms. Dinnerstein,

31:27.150 --> 31:28.549
you're under
arrest.
It's Robbie.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.945
It's not me.

31:29.980 --> 31:30.947
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:30.990 --> 31:31.945
Anything
you say...

31:31.990 --> 31:33.287
She's lying.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.389
She said I was setting her up?

31:34.420 --> 31:35.682
Yes.
LYLE:
This is insane.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.608
Who is this girl?
DIANE:
It's her cloud account.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.184
She left evidence at the scene.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.448
She said that you created
and ran Silk Road.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.422
That you were worried
about Jeremy Barba

31:43.460 --> 31:45.098
turning on you if
you were arrested,

31:45.130 --> 31:47.018
and that you used your Bitcoin
to hire someone to kill him.

31:47.070 --> 31:48.196
And the cloud account?

31:48.240 --> 31:48.990
That Robbie_had
access to It,

31:49.040 --> 31:50.234
so he could've
planted it there.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.238
DIANE:
So...

31:52.270 --> 31:54.409
is there an arrest
on the horIzon, Mr. Polmar?

31:54.440 --> 31:56.032
POLMAR:
I've _a rrestec_l
Ms. DInnersteIn.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.570
But I might need Robbie's help

31:57.610 --> 32:00.545
to testify
against her.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.647
You asked
to see us?

32:03.680 --> 32:04.487
Are we being scolded?

32:04.520 --> 32:06.988
You need to stop
courting my clients.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.681
We're not courting anyone,
Diane.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.551
You need to take
better care of them.
No, David.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.182
That won't work with me.
What won't?

32:12.230 --> 32:13.481
Trying to make me think
it's my fault.

32:13.530 --> 32:15.191
Kalinda. ..
KALIN DA:
You have met

32:15.230 --> 32:17.027
on eight separate occasions

32:17.060 --> 32:19.164
outside of work
in the last two weeks.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.189
We like each other.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.458
You don't like anyone, David.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.491
KALINDA:
You also requested records

32:23.540 --> 32:25.701
of billable hours _
and partner compensatIon.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.129
So, what would you conclude
from that, Alicia?

32:28.180 --> 32:29.704
Uh... Diane?

32:29.740 --> 32:31.207
You're isolating me.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.649
YouTe
gaslighting me.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.717
You're trying to take over
the managerial spot.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.578
Tell her.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.178
You sure?

32:44.230 --> 32:45.527
Yeah.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.255
We've been estate planning.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.121
That's why we met eight times
outside the office.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.196
Actually, I think it was nine.
My assistant

32:51.230 --> 32:52.458
gets things
wrong.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.524
DIANE: _
Estate plannIng?

32:53.570 --> 32:55.231
What, are you two
getting married?

32:55.270 --> 32:57.090
I'm dying.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.537
Doctors gave me
12 months to live.

33:00.570 --> 33:03.368
I have, uh...

33:03.410 --> 33:04.638
children and-and a wife,

33:04.680 --> 33:06.602
and I need to get
my affairs in order.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.675
That's why the urgency
of the estate planning.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.119
CANNING:
That's why I came here.

33:10.150 --> 33:12.789
I wanted to... have a home.

33:12.820 --> 33:14.458
Have somewhere
I could make amends.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.583
How long have you known this?

33:16.620 --> 33:17.780
CANNING:
Two months.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.152
I really don't want
anyone else to know

33:20.190 --> 33:22.499
and H don't want any pity

33:22.530 --> 33:24.225
and H don't_want
anyone cryIng.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.567
I-I just...

33:25.600 --> 33:26.669
Do me that
kIndness.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.793
I-I will.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.762
I'm sorry.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.376
It has to happen to all of us.

33:37.810 --> 33:39.038
He's a good guy.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.551
You believe him?

33:53.590 --> 33:56.525
I did, until he said,
"I don't want pity."

33:57.530 --> 34:00.124
You want me to find out?

34:01.170 --> 34:02.933
Yep.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.801
(clock ticking)

34:12.810 --> 34:14.346
GIFFORD (on television):
Sex...

34:14.380 --> 34:17.679
is a chimera.

34:17.720 --> 34:20.245
I saw a crack whore
eat her own arm.

34:20.290 --> 34:22.349
I saw a baby drowned like a cat.

34:22.390 --> 34:24.779
Sex...

34:24.830 --> 34:27.287
just keeps us occupied.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.423
Because reality

34:29.460 --> 34:31.291
can't be endured.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.663
Even this will end in smoke.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.190
(knocking at door)

34:39.840 --> 34:41.728
I didn't know
he'd get there so early.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.407
I thought we'd have
more time for lunch.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.475
Hi, Mom.

34:44.510 --> 34:45.602
What are you doing?

34:46.850 --> 34:48.545
I have no idea what I'm doing.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.413
Well, whatever it is,
I'm gonna do it with you.

34:51.450 --> 34:52.815
Yes, for the last 12 months

34:52.850 --> 34:55.580
the office has been mired
in sloth and politics.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.258
INTERVIEWER:
Let's talk about the event
of December 20.

34:57.290 --> 34:58.621
Yes, that was terrible.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.389
And in your own words,
what happened?

35:00.430 --> 35:03.854
Well, a defendant
took a sheriff's gun

35:03.900 --> 35:05.265
killed a witness,

35:05.300 --> 35:06.722
and then tried
to shoot himself.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.465
Did you think you'd
make it out alive?

35:08.500 --> 35:10.229
Come on. Come on.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.636
Well, there really
wasn't time to think.

35:12.670 --> 35:14.774
A man was in front
of me, bleeding.

35:14.810 --> 35:17.335
This was, uh, the
opposing attorney?

35:17.380 --> 35:18.574
Yes, he'd been shot.

35:18.610 --> 35:19.907
And you were
trying to cover him,

35:19.950 --> 35:20.700
even though you
were wounded?

35:20.750 --> 35:22.377
Come on, come on.
You can do it.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.739
Mandy, I'm sorry.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.748
Will Gardner
was the hero.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.849
I was just
luclq.
Yes.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.188
Why is that?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.859
He tried to get the gun
away from Jeffrey Grant.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.755
Ijust, uh...

35:34.800 --> 35:37.519
You just... tried
to protect Will?

35:37.560 --> 35:39.562
I wish I'd done more.

35:40.870 --> 35:42.861
This wasn't your first
brush with tragedy,

35:42.900 --> 35:44.538
was it, Mr. Polmar?
Your sister

35:44.570 --> 35:46.834
Leah, committed suicide
a few years ago

35:46.870 --> 35:48.735
after a long battle
with drug addiction.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.668
It'll be three years
in June, yes.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.803
I understand your family
took a "tough love" approach,

35:52.850 --> 35:55.774
refusing to help her
those final days.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.515
What are you doing?
Trying to blindside us?

35:57.550 --> 36:00.417
As any family who's dealt
with drug addiction knows,

36:00.450 --> 36:02.350
you try everything,

36:02.390 --> 36:04.722
because you desperately
want to save them.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.785
Rehab, psychiatrists,
interventions

36:06.830 --> 36:08.252
and yes,
tough love.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.722
Would you say this
was an instance

36:09.760 --> 36:12.968
where tough
love... failed?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.265
Drug addiction is
an insidious disease.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.938
I think the hardest
lesson for all of us

36:17.970 --> 36:20.302
was knowing that no matter
what we did to help,

36:20.340 --> 36:21.807
ultimately it
wasn't up to us.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.637
Good.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.602
Good.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.745
How did she know about Leah?

36:28.780 --> 36:29.974
I don't know.

36:30.020 --> 36:30.816
Probably Castro.

36:30.850 --> 36:31.919
You did well.

36:31.950 --> 36:33.815
No, I didn't.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.488
I should've told her
to go to hell.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.284
That's when you know
you're a true politician--

36:38.330 --> 36:39.479
when you don't.

36:46.630 --> 36:49.531
You didn't deserve
this, Norma Jean.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.538
VERONICA:
You called me.

36:51.570 --> 36:52.537
ALICIA:
No.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.470
It was Owen.

36:54.510 --> 36:56.239
Oh, right.
He-he called us both,

36:56.280 --> 36:57.406
because he was...

36:57.440 --> 36:58.543
he was staying
at Dad's that weekend.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.842
Oh, you're right.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.416
Owen started
cryIng.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.418
"Dad is dead."

37:03.450 --> 37:04.917
Oh...
I remember.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.440
I couldn't
catch my breath.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.912
I just couldn't
breathe.

37:07.950 --> 37:10.009
Oh, I thought
he'd live forever.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.857
I thought he'd live
longer than you.

37:11.890 --> 37:13.426
Mmm.
(laughs)

37:13.460 --> 37:14.996
God, he was strong
as an ox, wasn't he?

37:15.030 --> 37:17.726
I always thought you two
would get back together.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.921
Oh, we tried.

37:19.970 --> 37:22.461
Some people are just
better at being friends.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.737
Why are you looking
at your watch?

37:25.770 --> 37:27.408
Are you afraid the
kids are gonna come home

37:27.440 --> 37:29.271
and see us
both drunk?

37:29.310 --> 37:30.470
I'm not drunk.

37:30.510 --> 37:32.501
Then why are you
looking at your watch?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.279
It's on my wrist.

37:37.650 --> 37:38.981
I'm like him, aren't I?

37:39.020 --> 37:40.783
What do you mean?

37:40.820 --> 37:42.959
Stuck being the good one.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.059
He talked about work.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.988
How he'd always stay late

37:52.030 --> 37:54.021
cleaning up after everyone.

37:55.940 --> 38:01.298
Dad said there are people
who make the mess...

38:01.340 --> 38:04.400
and people who clean up.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.748
And you two are the cleaners.

38:06.780 --> 38:08.771
I don't know what I am anymore.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.716
(sighs)

38:12.750 --> 38:14.752
Nothing's as simple
as it used to be.

38:16.490 --> 38:18.629
What's going on, Alicia?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.695
I'm spinning, Mom.

38:23.730 --> 38:25.322
I can't stop.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.496
(exhales)

38:26.530 --> 38:27.997
I shouldn't have
stopped working.

38:28.030 --> 38:29.031
Oh, honey,

38:29.070 --> 38:31.095
you're just hurting.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.938
I'm so sorry
you have to go through this.

38:33.970 --> 38:36.029
I don't know what
to do, Mom.
Oh, sweetheart.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.571
(sobbing)
Shh, shh, no, no, no.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.941
Shh-Shh.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.777
Oh, baby, nobody does.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.776
(Alicia sobbing)

38:43.820 --> 38:45.845
Shh...

38:48.490 --> 38:49.957
Anything on Canning?

38:52.790 --> 38:54.792
Diane...

38:54.830 --> 38:56.559
ifI had information

38:56.600 --> 38:58.090
that would make you withdraw

38:58.130 --> 38:59.961
as Robbie's attorney,
would you want it?

39:02.170 --> 39:03.262
Yes.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.407
I was looking at e-mails
from Corsica's cloud storage.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.705
This is an
e-maII request

39:10.740 --> 39:12.549
for Jeremy Barba's
murder.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.002
She told him that
she wanted to

39:14.050 --> 39:16.416
purchase something
from him, except

39:16.450 --> 39:17.940
she wrote "perches,"
like the fish.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.083
It's an autocorrect glitch.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.385
No. "Purchase" isn't spelling
anything like the fish.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.923
But they do sound alike.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.428
Voice recognition software.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.121
Yeah.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.025
It's a speech
recognition glitch.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.026
And it's the same
mistake that shows up

39:34.070 --> 39:37.096
four times in Robbie's
reviews on Silk Road.

39:37.140 --> 39:40.109
It looks like Robbie
did set up Corsica.

39:40.140 --> 39:43.075
(sighs heavily)

39:43.110 --> 39:44.873
Well, that's not good.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.088
Finn...

39:59.130 --> 40:00.927
My apologies, but...

40:00.960 --> 40:02.188
something's come up.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.596
I'm gonna have to withdraw
myself from this case.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.621
Really?
Why is that?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.126
There's a conflict.
That's all I'm able to say.

40:08.170 --> 40:09.660
I'm sorry.

40:09.700 --> 40:10.837
What's going on, Diane?

40:10.870 --> 40:11.962
I'm referring the Pollards

40:12.010 --> 40:12.999
to another law firm.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.473
Thanks for coming over here.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.082
Hey, Alicia.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.087
You got a minute?

40:26.120 --> 40:28.088
I do. How are you doing?

40:28.120 --> 40:30.918
Oh, it's been a long day.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.188
Here, too.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.754
Look, I'm on a case.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.997
Lockhart/Gardner's
on the other side.

40:36.030 --> 40:37.156
Or was.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.189
Diane just withdrew herself

40:38.230 --> 40:40.198
from the case for no reason.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.162
Now, is that like her?

40:41.200 --> 40:42.462
Well...

40:42.500 --> 40:44.195
Do you feel comfortable
discussing this?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.128
Yes. I...
It's not like her.

40:46.170 --> 40:48.934
The clients are her friends,
the Pollards.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.231
Oh, I know them.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.679
The grandson.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.473
No, I don't know him.

40:53.510 --> 40:56.115
Is there a chance the client
Intends to perjure hImself?

40:56.150 --> 40:58.141
Well, I can't say
for certain, but

40:58.180 --> 41:00.580
it would be one reason why
Diane would back out.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.053
She would never suborn perjury.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.580
Okay. Thanks.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.723
Hey... sounds like
you're on the street.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.897
You all right?

41:09.930 --> 41:12.262
I had the... had a day off.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.927
Sounds good.

41:13.970 --> 41:15.892
Uh, did Eli get ahold of you?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.567
Yeah.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.068
Yeah...

41:20.110 --> 41:21.737
He wants to turn me
Into a hero.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.179
Yes.

41:23.210 --> 41:24.700
Eli is good at that.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.069
That's right.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.805
He already turned you
into a saint.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.545
Yep.

41:29.580 --> 41:30.945
Talk to you later.

41:32.690 --> 41:33.816
This is a betrayal.

41:33.850 --> 41:34.987
It's better for Robbie
that I do.

41:38.090 --> 41:39.626
How can you just withdraw?

41:39.660 --> 41:41.252
It's best for
Robbie that I do.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.258
Why? Tell me why.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.927
I can't.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.790
Diane, you're abandoning us.

41:46.830 --> 41:47.797
My apologies.

41:47.830 --> 41:48.831
Oh, thank you!

41:48.870 --> 41:50.189
That-that's very helpful.

41:58.710 --> 42:00.143
Sounded like it went poorly.

42:00.180 --> 42:03.149
Not great.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.272
Do you have
something?

42:04.320 --> 42:05.719
Yeah.

42:05.750 --> 42:06.978
On Canning?

42:07.020 --> 42:08.248
Yes.

42:08.290 --> 42:09.917
So is he dying?

42:09.960 --> 42:11.188
Or is he trying
to screw me?

42:13.330 --> 42:16.299
He is dying...

42:16.330 --> 42:18.218
and he's trying to screw you.

42:18.260 --> 42:20.262
(Anya Marina's
"High on the Ceiling" plays)

42:47.360 --> 42:49.225
It's one drink.

42:49.260 --> 42:50.693
Why is that a problem?

42:53.400 --> 42:55.368
Who am I being faithful to?

42:55.400 --> 42:58.631
* I read all your mail

42:59.840 --> 43:03.037
* I searched all your clothes.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.071
*
