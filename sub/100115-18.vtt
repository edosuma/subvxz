00:02.306 --> 00:05.222
[Jughead] "Lynchian."
Adjective to describe
something inspired

00:05.266 --> 00:08.356
by the noted American
filmmaker, David Lynch.

00:08.399 --> 00:13.665
And/or to describe something that is both incredibly macabre and incredibly mundane.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.407
[ominous music playing]

00:20.194 --> 00:24.720
Also, Riverdale's status quo,
reaching new depths
of perversion

00:24.763 --> 00:28.115
with the discovery of a videotape in which someone wearing a mask of me

00:28.158 --> 00:31.944
is bludgeoned to death
by someone wearing a mask
of my girlfriend.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.685
-[thud]
-Hey, what are
you guys watching?

00:33.729 --> 00:36.079
-[tape stops playing]
-Jellybean, you gotta
get out of here.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.081
Sorry, this is NC-17 stuff.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.649
Fine. Whatever.

00:40.692 --> 00:44.479
Okay, so that was dropped off
at the sheriff's station,

00:44.522 --> 00:46.742
in a bin with all
of the other Voyeur tapes?

00:46.785 --> 00:49.397
Yeah, but all the other Voyeur
tapes were just static shots

00:49.440 --> 00:51.181
of people's houses
at a distance.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.227
This is clearly
an escalation.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.968
It's a recreation of whatever
someone thinks happened
to me in the woods.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.362
And the big questions are:
Who is doing this

00:58.406 --> 01:00.147
-and what are we gonna
do about it?
-Me?

01:00.190 --> 01:03.715
Nothing. No. I'm not
getting pulled into some
creepy new mystery.

01:03.759 --> 01:07.023
But you can feel free
to get sucked
into this one, okay?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.547
I could always use
an extra set of eyes
and ears, little brother.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.769
[presses button]

01:13.812 --> 01:15.684
[Hiram whistling]

01:18.643 --> 01:21.342
[Veronica] You're unusually
chipper today, Daddy.

01:21.385 --> 01:25.128
Mija,I just closed
a major distribution deal.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.262
As of this morning,
I'll be supplying
all the rum

01:28.305 --> 01:32.570
for the Grande family's chain
of casinos, up and down
the Eastern seaboard.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.182
You're doing business
with Elio shady ass again?

01:35.225 --> 01:36.922
All I'm doing is selling
rum, mija.

01:36.966 --> 01:40.143
And beating you to a market
you hadn't even considered.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.014
I did consider it.
Weeks ago.

01:42.058 --> 01:46.758
Instead, Red Raven is
expanding into a heretofore
untapped market.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.238
The college crowd.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.589
With an affordable version
of our product, Maple Claw.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.721
Good luck with that.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.516
-[Reggie] What's up?
-[Fogarty] What's up, Reggie?

02:05.560 --> 02:09.085
What's up is I hear you
two have some scam going

02:09.128 --> 02:11.261
where you're bringing in
some serious bank.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.828
Are you dealing again, Fangs?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.221
No. Are you?

02:14.264 --> 02:15.961
No. That's why I'm broke.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.138
And I want in
on whatever you're doing.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.749
So, what's the scam?

02:26.015 --> 02:29.279
-We make tickle videos
for a guy named Terry.
-Hmm?

02:29.323 --> 02:31.934
And before you assume
the worst, it's not sexual.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.457
No clothes come off
at any time.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.850
It's like an endurance sport.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.983
And this Terry guy pays you?

02:38.027 --> 02:39.507
[Fogarty] Yeah.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.857
[smacks lips] And a lot more
than dealing.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.511
That's weird as hell, boys.

02:44.599 --> 02:48.646
But do you think Terry
could use a guy like me?

02:52.781 --> 02:54.174
[guitar strumming]

03:35.954 --> 03:39.610
[Betty] "Dear diary,
today I fell in love
with the boy next door.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.179
He has red hair and freckles

03:43.223 --> 03:45.573
and a scar on his eyebrow
that he got when he
fell off his bicycle.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.795
His name is Archie Andrews,

03:50.839 --> 03:53.972
and he has a dog named Vegas,
who is super cute,
but not as cute as Archie."

03:54.016 --> 03:55.713
-[knock on door]
-Hey.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.019
Hi.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.194
What are you reading?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.935
Just looking at
one of my old diaries.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.459
Oh, fifth grade.
That's juicy.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.289
-Mom, seriously. [chuckles]
-I'm sorry.

04:07.203 --> 04:10.293
Oh, honey,
you're so grown up.

04:10.337 --> 04:14.341
I can't believe you're gonna
be leaving for Yale
in a few months.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.647
My precious little girl.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.129
Mom, please, do not cry.
If you cry, I'm going to cry.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.435
[sighs] I'm sorry.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.963
What could you possibly
cry about, honey?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.579
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.281
Three cases, as ordered.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.500
Your party will be the hit
of frat row, boys.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.285
Would be a bigger hit
if you two came.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.026
You ladies supply anything
other than booze?

04:49.114 --> 04:51.291
Ew! Get out of my sight.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.031
Bye!

04:58.210 --> 05:01.083
Honestly, Veronica,
what happened
to "quality always"?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.998
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

05:03.041 --> 05:05.043
[suspenseful music playing]

05:05.087 --> 05:08.612
Oh, great. The cast
of Swamp Thingjust got here.

05:08.656 --> 05:12.790
Welcome. I don't have
any more orders
scheduled for pick-up,

05:12.834 --> 05:14.618
but can I help you?

05:14.662 --> 05:18.361
Actually, little lady,
we're just, uh, checking out
the competition.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
Jinx Malloy,
of the Malloy family.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.975
Maybe you gals have
heard of us.

05:24.019 --> 05:27.152
No, I'm afraid I canceled
my subscription
to Truckers Weekly.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.199
That's funny.
You know what's not funny?

05:30.242 --> 05:33.420
[inhales sharply] You bitches
are cutting into our profits.

05:33.463 --> 05:38.120
You see, we Malloys have been
running the Maple Moonshine
business for generations.

05:38.163 --> 05:43.168
And one of our most
lucrative markets
is the college scene.

05:43.212 --> 05:48.739
But recently we've been
getting wind of a new
product that's...

05:48.783 --> 05:50.872
eating into
our customer base.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.704
Maple Claw.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.750
Let's say that's true.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.971
What exactly would you
like us to do about that?

06:03.014 --> 06:04.102
Just pull your product.

06:04.146 --> 06:07.279
[soft chuckle]
I don't think so.

06:07.323 --> 06:10.674
See, I can guess
who you boys work for.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.242
And you can tell him

06:13.285 --> 06:16.376
that Veronica Lodge
and Cheryl Blossom

06:16.419 --> 06:18.943
do not back down
from a fight.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.904
Now, if you'll excuse us,

06:23.557 --> 06:24.993
we have bottles to fill.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.603
[bottle clinks]

06:26.647 --> 06:28.823
Don't say we didn't warn you.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.878
-[sighs]
-Veronica, what the hell
was that?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.227
That was a bluff.

06:42.271 --> 06:45.100
Trust me, Cheryl,
this is typical of my father.

06:45.143 --> 06:48.886
Last year, he sent thugs
in gargoyle masks
to beat up on Reggie.

06:48.930 --> 06:52.673
This year, it's hillbillies
who claim to produce
Maple Moonshine.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.768
Well, the good news is,
both drop-off boxes,

07:00.811 --> 07:03.074
the one
at the sheriff's station
and the one upstairs,

07:03.118 --> 07:05.033
are under surveillance 24/7.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.557
So maybe we can identify
the person who dropped
off this faux snuff film.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.777
Yeah, well,
it's hours of footage.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.519
Does this place have
any popcorn?

07:12.562 --> 07:14.695
[popcorn popping]

07:25.053 --> 07:26.054
[clicks]

07:31.973 --> 07:33.148

07:34.149 --> 07:35.455
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.413
What? Do you
recognize someone?

07:37.457 --> 07:41.635
Uh, maybe. But I think
I'm gonna check this lead
out alone. Is that cool?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.076
[clicks]

07:51.296 --> 07:53.603
Jughead's working late
with Charles.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.084
The videotapes.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.741
Veronica's with Cheryl.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.266
Doing her maple rum thing.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.487
Archie...

08:09.358 --> 08:10.751
why are we here?

08:16.539 --> 08:17.671
I don't know.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
But it's nice.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.198
Right?

08:25.548 --> 08:28.508
It is, but it's not
like we can do anything...

08:29.204 --> 08:30.988
more than this.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.514
What do you mean?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.864
We're just hanging out.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.871
I love Jughead.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.051
And I love Veronica.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.143
But this is nice, right?

09:27.828 --> 09:29.830
What would you say
if you were here, Dad?

09:33.268 --> 09:36.750
Probably something corny
like, "Follow your heart."

09:38.316 --> 09:39.753
[chuckles softly]

09:41.015 --> 09:43.800
The problem is,
I have no idea
where it's pointed.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.067
And I don't want
to hurt anyone.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.767
I'm just... [sighs]

09:56.596 --> 09:58.119
I'm just missing you a lot.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.776
[school bell rings]

10:04.647 --> 10:08.042
Ethel, do you have
a moment to talk
in private?

10:08.085 --> 10:09.391
Jughead, sure.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.612
This is so unexpected.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.091
[soft chuckle]

10:14.135 --> 10:16.703
Yeah, what can I say,
it's been a pretty weird year.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.923
I actually wanted to talk
to you about some of those
creepy video tapes.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.882
You dropped off a couple
at the station, right?

10:21.925 --> 10:25.625
I did, yeah. It was
just hours and hours
of our house.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.539
Nothing new.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.845
Well, there actually
was something new
on one of them.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.978
It was footage of someone
dressed up as Betty,

10:31.021 --> 10:33.415
murdering someone
dressed up as me,
with a rock.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.331
-Oh, my God!
-You don't know anything
about that, do you?

10:36.374 --> 10:38.159
What? No. Of course not.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.987
It's just that
you're the only person
who has a direct connection

10:40.030 --> 10:41.815
to Betty and me
who dropped off a tape.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.470
I didn't. I swear.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.950
I'm just trying to keep
my head down

10:46.994 --> 10:49.039
and make it out
of Riverdale in one piece.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.825
I didn't make any tape.

10:57.613 --> 11:01.095
[Betty] "Dear diary,
today was the happiest day
of my life.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.966
After walking home
from school,

11:03.010 --> 11:05.403
little Archie
proposed to me.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.670
Of course I want
to marry Archie,
but I know we're too young.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.673
So I told him that
he should ask me again
when we're both 18

11:13.716 --> 11:15.370
and in high school."

11:15.413 --> 11:16.850
Everything all right, Betty?

11:17.807 --> 11:21.506
Yeah. Sorry,
I was just thinking about--

11:21.550 --> 11:22.769
Simpler times.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.990
Simpler times.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.514
[Mr. Honey over PA]
Betty Cooper to
the principal's office.

11:29.558 --> 11:32.387
Betty Cooper to
the principal's office.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.868
-I really hate Mr. Honey.
-Likewise.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.088
I wonder
what I did this time.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
I'm confused.
What is this for?

11:42.266 --> 11:43.964
For the yearbook.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.575
You are editor-in-chief,
aren't you?

11:46.618 --> 11:47.881
Appointed last year.

11:48.316 --> 11:51.362
[sighs] Um, yes.

11:51.406 --> 11:55.540
In between being attacked
by the Black Hood
at junior prom

11:55.584 --> 12:00.110
and being hunted
by the Gargoyle King
before the Farm was raptured,

12:00.154 --> 12:04.201
I volunteered to be
in charge of the yearbook.

12:04.245 --> 12:09.250
Wonderful. So, tick-tock.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.213
So, did you solve the case?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.562
Unfortunately not.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.434
I had a hunch,
but it didn't pan out.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.565
But I did have
another thought,

12:20.609 --> 12:22.306
that maybe our suspect
is not a Voyeur.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.221
Maybe they're a filmmaker.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.484
Whoever made that video
in the woods had to know
what they were doing,

12:26.528 --> 12:27.877
and they even hired actors.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.184
Plus, the fact that
it's all on videotape,

12:30.227 --> 12:31.838
that's the hallmark
of a cinephile.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.535
Let's start at
the Bijou theater.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.843
Yeah. There's also
Paramecium Records
and Blue Velvet Video.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.979
Okay, that was seriously
one of the best videos
we've made yet.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.634
Good work.
Especially you, Reggie.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.201
You have a great laugh.

12:47.810 --> 12:48.985
Nice and deep.

12:50.682 --> 12:54.469
Keep this up and, uh,
we're all gonna make
a lot of money.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.866
[Reggie] We should go
into business on our own,

12:59.909 --> 13:02.172
and ditch this Terry dude.
We don't need him.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.131
This is Terry's operation,
Reggie.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.046
If we act
as our own distributor,

13:06.089 --> 13:07.787
we don't have
to cut anyone in

13:07.830 --> 13:09.310
on our hard-earned bank.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.791
We'll make our own website
and put it behind a pay wall.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.793
You know, it's not
a bad idea, Kevin.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.884
Look, all you have to do
is let Terry down easy.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.974
I'll take care of the rest.
Getting the equipment,

13:21.017 --> 13:22.671
recruiting us
some new talent.

13:22.714 --> 13:27.328
This is gonna pay
for our community college
education, boys.

13:31.549 --> 13:32.550
[doorbell rings]

13:34.857 --> 13:36.816
I can't believe places
like this still exist.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.992
Yeah. Open 24 hours, too.

-[man] Can I help you,
gentlemen?

13:41.777 --> 13:46.651
Yes, actually.
This is quite the retro vibe
you got going on.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.916
-FBI. Can we ask you
a couple of questions?
-Sure can.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.962
We're assuming you know
about the videotapes being
delivered around town?

13:53.006 --> 13:55.704
-Sure do.
-Have you heard anything
about them?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.967
Any of your customers
acting suspicious?

13:58.011 --> 14:00.535
They all act suspicious.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.972
Can we check all your records?
Who's rented what?

14:03.451 --> 14:05.018
Happy to oblige.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.846
[man clears throat]

14:06.889 --> 14:08.848
That's old school.
I like it.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.067
Each customer gets a page.

14:11.111 --> 14:15.245
The first column is the date
when they checked out
a tape.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.857
Second column is the date
they returned it.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.510
[Charles] Who is E. Muggs?

14:19.554 --> 14:23.906
Looks like they rented
Friday the 13th16 times.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.170
Oh, that's Ethel Muggs.
She's one of my regulars.

14:27.214 --> 14:30.565
Well, heck, you may know her.
Goes to Riverdale High.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.480
She's a senior,
I believe.

14:37.702 --> 14:41.358
Things aren't looking good
for your pal, Ethel Muggs.

14:41.402 --> 14:45.145
I admit that renting
Friday the 13th
over ten times is excessive,

14:45.188 --> 14:46.842
but it's not
a sign of guilt.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.497
I mean, I've seen Eraserhead
more times than I can count,

14:49.540 --> 14:51.020
it doesn't mean
I'm the man in the planet.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.370
She has a predilection
for horror films.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.720
She dropped off a videotape
at the station.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.332
You said yourself
that she was obsessed
with you, Jughead.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.377
[chuckles] In my book,
that makes her
a prime suspect.

15:00.421 --> 15:05.078
Charles, I'm telling you,
it finally seems like
Ethel is in a good place.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.775
And there's more
than 100 tapes.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.038
I don't think she has
the bandwidth or even
the equipment

15:09.082 --> 15:10.953
for that kind of operation.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.086

[Cheryl over phone] You need
to get to the Maple Club
right the hell now!

15:31.974 --> 15:35.021
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened in here?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.413
We were invaded

15:36.457 --> 15:39.068
by those mountain men
you insisted on provoking.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.505
-Who, the Malloys?
-[Penelope] Yes.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.378
I was sleeping
in my secret room
behind the office,

15:44.421 --> 15:46.249
and heard the door
being kicked in.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.643
It's only by the grace of God
they didn't find and molest
my mumzie.

15:48.686 --> 15:53.300
Miss Blossom, I am so sorry
this happened to you.

15:53.343 --> 15:56.303
I swear, I am going
to murder my father.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.313
[Hiram] You were out
early, mija.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.316
No. I was out late.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.840
All night.

16:11.883 --> 16:15.191
Cleaning up the Maple Club
after you sent those hillbilly
Malloys to trash it.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.107
What? I did no such thing.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.022
I would never do business
with the Malloys.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.590
They're ruthless competitors.
They're dangerous.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.854
Did Jinx's boys threaten you?

16:25.897 --> 16:28.291
-If he threatened you--
-No, no. If you didn't
start this,

16:28.335 --> 16:30.119
then it's none
of your concern, okay?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.165
Do not underestimate
the Malloys.

16:32.774 --> 16:33.905
I've tangled with them.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.646
Let me help you
deal with this.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.084
Okay? I'll settle whatever
dispute you have with them.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.564
Absolutely not, Daddy.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.871
This is my business, my war,

16:42.914 --> 16:45.047
and I'm gonna win it
on my terms.

16:45.091 --> 16:49.269
Besides, if the Malloys
are as dangerous
as you're insinuating,

16:49.312 --> 16:52.359
you may not be strong enough
to go up against them.

Archie, what are you
doing here?

17:49.720 --> 17:52.332
Kev told me that
Honey's making you
do the yearbook.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.073
-I wanna help you.
-No.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.294
Arch, you're not helping me
with the yearbook,

17:58.338 --> 18:01.254
and that's not why
you're here.

18:04.474 --> 18:09.131
Okay, you're right.
Honestly, I can't stop
thinking about you, Betty.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.264
I've tried,
but it's impossible.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.442
Archie, we can't do this.

Not here.

about you either.

-So maybe...
-We meet tonight.

-At the bunker, maybe.
-No. Not... Not...
Not tonight.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.111
Tomorrow night.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.766
So we have time to think
about this.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.857
And make sure
it's what we really want.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.772
Tomorrow night.

18:41.816 --> 18:45.298
That actually gives me
a little time to do something.

Hi, Miss Bell.
Now, as a senior, I should
probably know this,

18:58.180 --> 18:59.747
but does this school
have an AV Club?

19:00.269 --> 19:02.141
We do, Mr. Jones.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.447
Can anyone get access
to the equipment?

19:04.491 --> 19:07.494
I mean, I assume they have
like video cameras and VCRs.

19:07.537 --> 19:12.325
Oh, yes,
but only AV Club members
are allowed to use it.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.240
Is Ethel Muggs a member
of the AV Club?

19:14.283 --> 19:15.850
She's the president.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.245
How funny.
You're the second person
to ask me that today.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.813
The first was a handsome
FBI agent.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.206
Where is he now?

all the opportunities
you've given me.

that I stop making videos
with you.

the Bulldogs exclusively?

to drop off your

Yes, and about that,
I'll be needing two pages.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.963
Uh, it's one page per senior.

24:47.007 --> 24:50.053
Yes, and for average humans
that would suffice.

to Jay-Jay.

you hated me back in the day.

we're doing more than
just pretending to date

25:22.695 --> 25:24.740
-when Jughead was dead?
-No.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.824
you and Jughead
found each other.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
That's real.

26:07.609 --> 26:12.135
That's maybe even,
dare I say, "endgame"?

26:13.049 --> 26:14.050
Who knows?

26:15.443 --> 26:19.055
People stray, it happens.

26:19.099 --> 26:24.060
The trick is... stop straying
before anyone gets hurt.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.933
Or even better,
stop before you even start.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.681
[doorbell rings]

26:39.336 --> 26:40.729
What the hell?

26:40.773 --> 26:43.210
You've been
a naughty boy, Kevin.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.081
-Terry.
-You lied to me.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.518
You weren't getting out
of the tickle business,

26:47.562 --> 26:49.303
you were setting up
your own shop.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.088
We don't want
to make trouble.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.264
Mmm. You already did.

26:56.266 --> 26:59.052
-So...
-[Kevin grunts]

26:59.095 --> 27:01.358
Here's how you're going
to fix this.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.491
You and your buddies...

27:03.534 --> 27:05.667
will give us 40%
of your profits.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.540
I'll have to talk
to my partners.

27:09.584 --> 27:10.629
[knuckles cracking]

27:10.672 --> 27:12.979
[groans, grunts]

27:15.111 --> 27:16.678
Forty percent.

27:17.766 --> 27:21.683
Or you'll never tickle anyone
ever again.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.730
[grunts] Okay, okay.
Terry, I get it. Jeez.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.820
[breathes heavily]

27:39.353 --> 27:41.181
[indistinct chatter]

27:45.359 --> 27:48.275
Hey, Ethel, got a minute?

27:49.232 --> 27:51.887
This is a sex tape
of me and my girlfriend,

27:51.931 --> 27:55.151
filmed without our consent
at Stonewall Prep.

27:55.195 --> 27:58.459
And Charles found it
while searching your house.

27:58.502 --> 28:03.159
I stood up for you, Ethel.
I believed you, and you had
this tape the whole time?

28:03.203 --> 28:06.989
-Where did you even get this?
From Bret?
-No.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.166
There's a place in the back
of the Blue Velvet Video Store.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.604
A secret place.
It's called the Scarlet Suite.

28:13.648 --> 28:17.608
Uh-huh. And what's in this
Scarlet Suite?

28:17.652 --> 28:22.526
Tapes. Rougher ones.
Weirder ones. Homemade.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.398
Like the Voyeur tapes?

28:25.660 --> 28:30.404
And darker stuff.
Like... sex tapes.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.449
Maybe even snuff films,
I heard.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.757
And that's where this was?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.545
The video was called
Ponytail Playmate.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.243
I thought it sounded fun.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.549
But the second I saw
what it was, I swear,
I turned it off.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.814
And I kept it because
I didn't want anyone else
to get their hands on it.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.424
Please, you have
to believe me.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.905
Go to the Scarlet Suite,
Jughead.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.471
You'll find
what you're looking for.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.955
[Kevin]
Shut everything down ASAP.

28:59.999 --> 29:03.785
We can't. Our videos
are already uploaded.

29:03.829 --> 29:07.006
We're a hit, bro.
A big, fat, stinking hit.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.659
Then we need
to give Terry a cut.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.574
-[Reggie] No.
-No, just a taste.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.186
No way.
This is our thing, not his.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.362
And I know
how to handle Terry.

29:15.405 --> 29:20.802
All I need you to do is set up
a meeting with him
at the Five Seasons.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.631
I got your back, bro.
Trust me.

29:23.674 --> 29:24.937
[exhales]

29:27.635 --> 29:29.245
[David]
How can I help you, fellas?

29:29.289 --> 29:31.247
Keep out of our way,
we have a warrant
to search the store.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.292
Uh...

29:55.489 --> 29:56.969
[Jughead] What?

29:57.970 --> 29:59.798
What is it, Jughead?

29:59.841 --> 30:02.148
Only 18 and over
allowed back here.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.585
Where the hell
did you get this?

30:04.628 --> 30:07.631
People come in
selling and trading
all kinds of tapes.

30:07.675 --> 30:11.897
It's a video
of Clifford Blossom shooting
his son Jason Blossom.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.507
It's an actual snuff film.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.259
[Terry scoffs]

30:29.001 --> 30:31.394
This is making
a lot more sense now.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.616
You boys better have
my 40%.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.619
[whistles]

30:44.973 --> 30:49.369
You know, if you'd asked
for 10%, maybe.

30:49.412 --> 30:53.634
But you got greedy,
so, here are our terms.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.376
You get zilch.

30:56.419 --> 31:00.728
And if any of your goons
so much as touch a hair
on my boy Kevin's head,

31:00.771 --> 31:04.863
me and the 'dogs
will break a lot more
than your fingers.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.387
You boys just made
a big mistake.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.266
[Cheryl] I'm so sorry
about your Dad,

31:17.310 --> 31:21.053
but I got into this business
for fun, to do something
fun with you.

31:21.096 --> 31:24.099
And it was, for a while.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.623
But some families
have rum in their veins,

31:26.667 --> 31:28.974
and other families
have maple syrup.

31:29.017 --> 31:32.151
And some blood types
simply are incompatible.

31:33.543 --> 31:37.199
In other words, partner,
I want out,
effective immediately.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.508
Okay.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.125
[bell ringing]

31:50.169 --> 31:52.084
You asked to see us,
Mr. Honey?

31:54.129 --> 31:55.087
I did.

31:57.437 --> 32:01.745
Earlier, I received
a troubling phone call,

32:01.789 --> 32:07.360
alerting me of a clandestine
online "tickling ring,"

32:07.403 --> 32:11.581
apparently
being operated by students
from Riverdale High.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.843
You care to comment on this?

32:12.887 --> 32:14.715
Was this some Terry guy
who called you?

32:14.758 --> 32:17.544
It doesn't matter who it was,
Mr. Mantle, is it true?

32:18.980 --> 32:21.896
You know what, Mr. Honey,

32:21.940 --> 32:25.595
yeah, we did produce
the videos.

32:25.639 --> 32:29.295
And there is nothing
wrong with it,
because it's just tickling.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.253
And what we did
doesn't break any laws.

32:31.297 --> 32:34.953
Yeah, and we were all
wearing clothes.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.999
Yes, you were, Mr. Mantle.
In fact, some of you
were wearing

32:38.043 --> 32:41.437
Bulldog jerseys
and Vixen practice uniforms,

32:41.481 --> 32:46.312
putting you in violation
of at least a dozen legal
and copyright laws.

32:46.355 --> 32:52.318
Not to mention,
under my direct jurisdiction.

32:52.361 --> 32:56.278
Which means,
I want your degenerate
website taken down

32:56.322 --> 33:00.152
immediately before it tarnishes
the reputation of this school.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.546
Do I make myself clear?

33:03.590 --> 33:04.591
Yes, sir.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.332
Good.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.161
Now, get out of my sight.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.347
[Archie] I wanted to share
something with you.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.654
-[sighs]
-What is it?

33:25.916 --> 33:28.615
It's a song I wrote for you.

33:42.324 --> 33:47.155
♪ The snow morning
When everything changes ♪

33:47.199 --> 33:50.071
♪ You let down
Your guard and I ♪

33:50.115 --> 33:53.161
♪ Saw something strange
I thought ♪

33:53.205 --> 33:56.860
♪ She's not made
For this world ♪

33:56.904 --> 34:00.212
♪ And neither am I

34:03.302 --> 34:07.610
♪ 'Cause you make me--

34:07.654 --> 34:09.047
Stop.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.791
What? What is it?
You don't like it?

34:14.835 --> 34:18.621
No, this... It's...
It's us.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.797
I love Jughead.

34:22.973 --> 34:26.237
And you love Veronica,
don't you?

34:28.109 --> 34:30.416
But then,
what has this all been about?

34:30.938 --> 34:32.983
I don't know.

34:33.027 --> 34:36.465
I don't know.
Maybe it's because
everything's changing...

34:37.031 --> 34:39.554
in the next few weeks.

34:39.599 --> 34:43.081
And you and I feel safe
with each other,
we always have.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.255
I don't know.

34:46.257 --> 34:49.565
And I do not want to hurt
or lose Jughead.

34:49.609 --> 34:52.612
I don't want to lose
or hurt Veronica either. I...

34:55.397 --> 34:59.836
So whatever this is,
or it was...

35:01.229 --> 35:04.711
[sighs] It's just over.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.290
[guitar strumming]

35:24.426 --> 35:26.385
[Mary] I love that song,
Archie.

35:26.428 --> 35:29.170
Sounds like you wrote it
for someone special.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.606
Has Veronica heard it yet?

35:32.478 --> 35:35.176
Uh, no, not yet.
It's a surprise.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.917
Well, she's going to love it.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.921
Hey, Mom,
if it's not too late...

35:42.531 --> 35:45.186
I'm ready to get serious
about the Naval Academy.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.234
That's wonderful news, Archie.

35:52.889 --> 35:57.503
And, uh, I know
I've been kinda flaky lately,

35:58.286 --> 36:01.463
but I'm all in now.
I promise.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.639
I think it's time
for a completely fresh start.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.817
Well, I will call Brooke
and tell her the good news.

36:16.783 --> 36:19.264
[Alice] Elizabeth,
what are you doing, honey?

36:19.307 --> 36:21.831
Exorcising my demons.

36:21.875 --> 36:25.400
Oh. But these
are your diaries.

36:25.444 --> 36:28.534
These are your childhood
memories, honey.
They're precious.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.972
And that's all they are, Mom.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.192
Memories.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.761
[sighs]
Why don't we save this one?

36:40.589 --> 36:43.940
It's okay to keep one,
if you want.

36:49.076 --> 36:52.558
Yeah. Right, one is fine.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.256
Thank you.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.740
[Fogarty] So, what's next?

37:03.351 --> 37:06.702
Graduation. Carnegie Mellon.

37:06.746 --> 37:10.402
So, I got into
the University of Pittsburgh.

37:12.882 --> 37:13.840
You did?

37:15.798 --> 37:18.236
You wanna go there? Why?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.412
Because they gave me
a scholarship.

37:21.456 --> 37:26.679
And because it's close
to Carnegie Mellon.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.724
[chuckles]

37:28.768 --> 37:33.816
I wonder what it would be like
for us to date somewhere
that's not in Riverdale.

37:33.860 --> 37:39.344
I've been... I've been
wondering that, too.

37:39.387 --> 37:42.695
And... [sighs]
...maybe we find out.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.828
Yeah, maybe we do.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.269
Mmm... So...

37:51.312 --> 37:54.881
Do you think Reggie
was right that it was Terry
that called Mr. Honey?

37:55.185 --> 37:57.100
Probably.

37:57.144 --> 38:01.061
I mean, how else would
Mr. Honey find out about
a clandestine tickling ring?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.454
[scoffs]

38:04.282 --> 38:09.635
Sorry, Holden.
The Scarlet Suite's
closed until further notice.

38:10.549 --> 38:14.335
-What happened?
-The FBI raided me.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.904
All my contraband's
been confiscated.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.862
I was just released myself.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.301
I'm sorry
to hear that, David.

38:25.564 --> 38:26.652
Well...

38:28.044 --> 38:29.916
It's probably for the best.

38:37.706 --> 38:40.927
I must admit,
I'm surprised.

38:40.970 --> 38:44.278
I know it's been a while
since I last came to you
asking for money,

38:44.322 --> 38:49.457
but... this will allow me
to buy Cheryl out
of the maple rum business.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.678
You refused my help
numerous times, as I recall.

38:52.721 --> 38:56.377
Yes. But the reasons
I didn't want to get
into business

38:56.421 --> 38:59.685
with you
were your immoral ways.

38:59.728 --> 39:03.602
What happened when you spared
that Malloy troll...

39:04.516 --> 39:06.909
you said it revealed
that you were weak.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.651
But I think
it did the exact opposite.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.654
It took strength for you
to not go back
to your old habits,

39:12.698 --> 39:15.396
and I'm proud of you for it.

39:31.543 --> 39:34.110
I shouldn't have gone
after one of your sons, Jinx.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.766
Was out of line.

39:37.810 --> 39:40.726
Hiram Lodge,
you outta know by now,

39:42.205 --> 39:44.599
you never turn your back
on a Malloy.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.734
Lesson learned.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.392
It showed me
that you have finally,

39:54.435 --> 39:57.569
truly, turned over
a new leaf.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.137
I have, mija.

40:04.227 --> 40:07.840
And, might I add,
it's a pleasure doing business
with you again.

40:13.323 --> 40:16.501
It was actually called
Ponytail Playmate?

40:16.849 --> 40:18.851
Yeah.

40:18.894 --> 40:22.289
Just when we thought
Bret Weston Wallis couldn't be
any more of a creep, huh?

40:22.332 --> 40:23.943
[phone vibrates]

40:25.292 --> 40:26.598
Cheryl's calling me.

40:29.775 --> 40:30.819
Hello?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.215
Yeah, I'll be right there.

40:35.258 --> 40:38.261
Cheryl just
got sent another tape.
She wants me to come over.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.090
-Oh, wow.
-Oh.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.832
-I know you swore off
mysteries, but--
-No.

40:45.312 --> 40:48.663
-I'm in.
-Well, well.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.883
Dream team
back together again?

40:54.103 --> 40:56.323
It was sitting on my doormat
when we got home.

40:56.366 --> 40:59.674
We thought it was gonna be
like the other tapes at first.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.474
[gun cocks]

41:18.519 --> 41:19.564
[gunshot]

41:21.522 --> 41:22.654
[exhales]

41:26.005 --> 41:27.180
Why me?

41:27.876 --> 41:30.009
Why are they coming after me?

41:30.052 --> 41:31.532
It's not just you, Cheryl.

41:32.185 --> 41:34.056
I got one, too.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.189
I have a feeling
we're only the first.
