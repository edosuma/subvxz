01:12.985 --> 01:14.683
<i>Hi, babe.</i>

01:14.813 --> 01:17.338
Dinner's almost ready.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.253
Wha... What...

01:19.383 --> 01:21.298
Where... Where am I?

01:21.429 --> 01:23.083
How did I get here?
Where's... my phone?

01:23.213 --> 01:25.650
Where's my phone?
Where are my glasses?

01:25.781 --> 01:26.956
Shh, shh, shh.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.914
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Calm down.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.287
Hi, Isaac.
You're late.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.245
And you broke the
Freezy machine.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.247
It's on the fritz!

02:00.337 --> 02:02.426
I haven't touched it.
Yeah, you did.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.559
If you hadn't, it wouldn't be
on the fritz, now, would it?

02:04.689 --> 02:06.604
Okay. I'll take a look.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.085
Hey.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.567
Let's checky-check that
gloomy mug at the door, huh?

02:12.697 --> 02:14.699
Better not be greeting
my customers

02:14.830 --> 02:16.571
with that sad-sack shit.

02:19.791 --> 02:23.230
You smell like... failure.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.585
After you're done
with the Freezy machine,

02:30.715 --> 02:32.891
clean up whatever happened
in the bathroom, okay?

02:33.022 --> 02:34.676
Devereaux!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.853
I'm watching you.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.301
[man] I'm sorry.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.694
I'm sorry, sorry.
Hold on.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.435
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. Shh.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.001
Hold on.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483
Ch-Charlie? Charlie?

02:59.614 --> 03:01.355
Hi, beautiful.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.411
<i>I'm gonna
give you another chance</i>

03:14.542 --> 03:16.848
<i>to remember

03:26.858 --> 03:27.903
<i>None of your
business. Keep going.</i>

03:28.033 --> 03:29.426
<i>No.</i>

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
<i>Okay. Taste-test the sauce,</i>

03:31.559 --> 03:34.126

03:45.964 --> 03:46.965

too much tarragon.</i>

03:47.096 --> 03:48.445
<i>What?</i>

03:48.576 --> 03:49.925
You owe me a song.
<i>You owe me a song.</i>

03:50.055 --> 03:52.493

04:06.942 --> 04:09.640
Charlie, what are you
even trying to do?

04:09.771 --> 04:13.644
I decided to forgive you
for humiliating me.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.429
Breaking up with me days after

04:15.559 --> 04:17.605
my father threw me
off the board was

04:17.735 --> 04:20.172
revealing of
your character.

04:20.303 --> 04:24.002
Now, I know I used a little
too much tarragon last time.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:25.569 --> 04:28.006
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
There you go.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.182
Hi. As I was saying,

04:30.313 --> 04:33.185
I, uh, know I used a little
too much tarragon last time,

04:33.316 --> 04:36.580
but, uh, this time,
I practiced restraint.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.496
What is wrong with you?

04:39.627 --> 04:41.019
Might be the best batch yet.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.412
Seriously?

04:43.761 --> 04:45.023
Please?
Mm-mm.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.547
Come on. Come here.
Oh, no, no.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.200
Open.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.725
There you go.
There you go.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.596
There you go.

05:06.218 --> 05:09.091
You should know I'm not willing
to live the rest of my life

05:09.221 --> 05:11.093
wondering what your life
is like without me.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.138
What?
The only way...

05:13.269 --> 05:15.489
that I can move on...

05:17.665 --> 05:20.189
You know, I hated
my father's hunting trips.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.410
Every year, being dragged
to some English countryside

05:23.540 --> 05:25.803
to trudge acres
of dreary terrain.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.370
But...

05:27.501 --> 05:31.809
I grew an admiration
for hunters.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.422
The patience and precision
it takes to make a kill.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.206
Please.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.340
Even though taking a life
at a distance lacks...

05:40.470 --> 05:42.516
a level of intimacy,
don't you think?

05:42.646 --> 05:46.694
I mean, the butchering
process comes close

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
if you do it right away.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.045
Mm-hmm.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.047
To stick your hands

05:52.177 --> 05:57.008
in between the warmth of
another creature's organs.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.928
I only know one other time
I've ever been inside

06:04.059 --> 06:06.148
another's body.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.889
Please.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.892
Oh.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.373
No.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.897
I wouldn't end you
with such a barbaric tool.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.029
No.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.163
This is for after.

06:24.949 --> 06:27.212
Because we both know

06:27.343 --> 06:31.260
the most intimate way
to end a life requires...

06:32.696 --> 06:35.351
...skin to skin,

06:35.482 --> 06:36.787
heartbeat...

06:38.789 --> 06:41.705
...to heartbeat...

06:45.361 --> 06:46.928
...touch.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.631
You can still change your mind
and sing for me.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.069
Come on. Sing for me.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.723
I can't.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.775
Sing for me!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.088
Yeah.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.829
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.527
I just, uh...
I'm still a little woozy

07:20.657 --> 07:22.224
from whatever
you gave me.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.792
Um, could I have my glasses, please?

07:24.922 --> 07:26.315
Please?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.273
Can I see you?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.275
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving

07:30.406 --> 07:31.668
when things
were hard. I...

07:31.799 --> 07:33.191
And you-you didn't tell me why.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.628
I did.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.891
No, you-you didn't.
You just left.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.154
Okay. You're right.
And I'm sorry.

07:39.284 --> 07:42.026
I've just been so stressed with
work at the hospital, you know?

07:42.157 --> 07:44.246
But, um, maybe if-if we talk,

07:44.376 --> 07:46.291
if we go to therapy.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.729
I mean, yeah, that's-that's...
that's all I want.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.295
Okay, okay. Yeah.

07:50.426 --> 07:53.298
Yeah, willing to try.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.649
It's been really hard for me.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.215
I know.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
I know, Charlie.

07:59.087 --> 08:02.482
Um, can I please look at you
in the eyes?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.309
Please?

08:39.170 --> 08:40.476
Here.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.956
Thank you.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.045
I just want to see you,
you know?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.877
Will you sing for me?

08:50.007 --> 08:51.356
Uh-huh. Yeah.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.461
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.301
No, no, you make the caterers
get to the boat

10:50.432 --> 10:52.782
two hours before the guests.
No later.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.177
Gas grades aren't clear.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
They're not clear?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.789
They're not clear.
I just pumped 87 into my Beemer

10:59.920 --> 11:02.836
because the markings are all
fucked-up and faded.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.576
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.275
This is more
than an inconvenience.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.929
That is a European

11:09.059 --> 11:10.452
luxury vehicle over there.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.975
It should only
sip 91 gas.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.282
I want a full refund.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.285
The gas is already in your car.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.721
That is because
you are not running

11:18.852 --> 11:19.983
a professional
business establishment.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.681
I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:21.811 --> 11:25.423
I can't give you a refund
for wrongly pumped gas.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.990
"Wrongly pumped gas"?

11:27.121 --> 11:28.557
That's what you're going with?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.387
What is that smell?

11:34.302 --> 11:35.956
Oh, my God.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.610
This place is
fucking disgusting.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.787
There is no way
this place is up to code.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.527
I am calling the
Better Business Bureau.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.922
I'm gonna have this redneck
shithole place shut down.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.228
What'd you say your name was?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.099
I'll give you a refund.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.753
That's what I thought.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.983
It's gonna take
two to three business days.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.288
"Two to three business days."

12:04.419 --> 12:06.290
With an attitude like that,
that's gonna

12:06.421 --> 12:08.292
get you a one-way ticket
to fucking nowhere.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.428
Is it okay if I just...

12:13.558 --> 12:15.822
Few of these? Oh, and...

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.042
Please.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.491
Okay.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.232
Oh, shit.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.020
Come on, come on.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.382
Emily!

13:38.513 --> 13:40.167
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.647
Please pick up. Please pick up.
Please. Please pick--

13:42.778 --> 13:44.127
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

13:44.258 --> 13:45.563
Oh, thank God.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.565
Okay, my name is Emily Kasahara.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.742
I've been drugged and kidnapped
by my ex, Charlie Bellwick.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.658
I don't know where I am,
but I'm somewhere in the forest,

13:53.789 --> 13:56.183
and I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.228
<i>Okay. Where is
the kidnapper now?</i>

13:58.359 --> 14:02.276
I don't know, but I heard him
yell my name, so he's close.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.017
<i>Okay. Well, we're gonna
figure out where you are</i>

14:04.147 --> 14:06.062
<i>and get you help ASAP.</i>

14:06.193 --> 14:07.890
<i>Are location services
enabled on your phone?</i>

14:08.021 --> 14:09.718
No. I thought that
he was using them

14:09.849 --> 14:11.589
to track me,
so I turned them off.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.722
<i>That's okay.
I have your number, so we can</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:15.550
<i>work with your carrier
to determine your location.</i>

14:15.680 --> 14:17.378
Okay. How long until
the police get here?

14:17.508 --> 14:19.336
<i>I won't know until we locate
your exact position,</i>

14:19.467 --> 14:21.686
<i>but it can take up to an hour
to work with your carrier</i>

14:21.817 --> 14:23.340
<i>and local dispatch.</i>
What?

14:23.471 --> 14:24.951
Can't you go any faster?

14:25.081 --> 14:26.648
<i>We'll go as fast as we can, Emily.</i>

14:26.778 --> 14:28.780
Okay, well,
I can't see anything.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.305
Could you video-call me
and guide me to somewhere safe?

14:31.435 --> 14:33.263
<i>Unfortunately, we do not have
video capabilities,</i>

14:33.394 --> 14:36.397
<i>and it's against regulations
to use our personal devices.</i>

14:36.527 --> 14:38.051
Against regulations?
Are you kidding me?

14:38.181 --> 14:40.053
I'm about to get killed.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.881
<i>Emily, can you feel around
for a hiding place?</i>

14:42.011 --> 14:44.579
I can't stay in one place,
or he's gonna find--

14:53.370 --> 14:55.285
Okay.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.680
Oh... oh, no. No, no, no.

14:58.810 --> 14:59.942
No.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.292
No, no, no. No.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.034
Please, please work.
Please, please, please.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.340
Okay.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.994
Um...

15:09.299 --> 15:10.953
Uh...

15:55.693 --> 15:57.304
Hello?
<i>Hello?</i>

15:57.434 --> 15:58.696
<i>Who is this?</i>

15:58.827 --> 16:00.524
It's Sam. Who's this?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.483
<i>Are you 911?</i>

16:02.613 --> 16:05.703
No. Uh...

16:05.834 --> 16:08.228
Oh, sh-- I'm... I think...
I think maybe I, um,

16:08.358 --> 16:10.447
accidentally dialed you earlier.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.407
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.104
What?

16:15.235 --> 16:16.584
Shh!

16:31.512 --> 16:33.470
Hello?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.619
Oh, my God.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.881
Oh, my God.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.752
<i>I think it was an animal.</i>

16:54.883 --> 16:56.885
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
I'm gonna go.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.452
No, no, no, no. Wait.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.757
<i>Wait. Can...</i>

16:59.888 --> 17:01.977
Can you do video calls, Sam?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.719
Uh, yeah. Why?

17:04.849 --> 17:06.329
Okay. Listen.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.157
My name is Emily,
and I have been kidnapped.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.855
<i>I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses,</i>

17:10.986 --> 17:13.597
<i>and all that I know is that
I am in the woods somewhere</i>

17:13.728 --> 17:16.600
<i>and my ex is coming to kill me.</i>

17:16.731 --> 17:18.211
What?

17:18.341 --> 17:20.691
Look, I just...
I need you to be my eyes for me.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.476
C-Can you... can you do that?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.391
Is this a scam or something?
'Cause--

17:24.521 --> 17:26.697
<i>No. I promise you
that this is very real.</i>

17:26.828 --> 17:29.613
If I can't get away from him,
he's going to kill me.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.615
I don't--

17:31.746 --> 17:33.965
<i>Look, I know that this sounds
like nonsense, but please.</i>

17:34.096 --> 17:36.011
Please, will you call me back?

17:36.142 --> 17:38.057
Why-why don't I call 911
for you?

17:38.187 --> 17:40.537
<i>Because I already called them,
and their fucking regulations</i>

17:40.668 --> 17:42.583
<i>won't let them video-call me.</i>

17:42.713 --> 17:44.498
<i>They're working to find
my location, but, um,</i>

17:44.628 --> 17:46.674
<i>it's gonna take a while,
so I just... I have to--</i>

17:46.804 --> 17:47.979
I-I don't think that--

17:48.110 --> 17:50.591
My phone screen is
really broken.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.680
If you hang up,

17:52.810 --> 17:55.726
<i>I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to make another call.</i>

17:55.857 --> 17:58.642
I-I don't think I'm the person
to do this for you. I--

17:58.773 --> 18:01.558
<i>All you need to do is be
my eyes for me. That's it.</i>

18:01.689 --> 18:03.865
Please.
Look, I need to keep running.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.736
<i>I need to,
and I can't do it alone.</i>

18:05.867 --> 18:07.260
<i>If I don't...</i>

18:07.390 --> 18:08.913
<i>If I don't, I--</i>

18:09.044 --> 18:10.480
Okay. Okay.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.526
Okay. Okay, thank you.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.962
So, um,

18:14.093 --> 18:15.355
<i>just-just video-call me back.</i>

18:15.485 --> 18:17.313
Yeah. Uh, I-I'm...

18:17.444 --> 18:19.359
I'm gonna hang up now.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.448
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

18:21.578 --> 18:23.102
Okay.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.776
Damn it.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.413
<i>Oh, thank God. I got worried.</i>

19:13.543 --> 19:15.937
Sorry. I, um,
just needed a second.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.547
<i>All right, I need
to figure out</i>

19:17.678 --> 19:20.463
which way to go,
so can you tell me what you see?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.770
Trees. Yeah. Trees. You're
in a forest.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.381
Okay. Uh, is there
a clearing in any direction?

19:25.512 --> 19:28.993
Uh, uh, yeah, uh,
to your left.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.909
Uh, maybe it'll be faster
without the trees.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.129
<i>Great. All right, now,
I need you to look behind me</i>

19:34.260 --> 19:36.349
<i>and make sure he's not there,
okay?</i>

19:37.567 --> 19:39.569
Okay. Uh...

19:45.227 --> 19:46.228
Wait. Stop.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.838
What was it?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.190
I thought I saw something move.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.541
I-I guess it was nothing.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.238
<i>It was nothing.
It's just, um...</i>

19:56.369 --> 19:58.153
Okay, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.024
I, um... I should... I should...
I should probably call

20:00.155 --> 20:02.026
someone else for you,
because I just... I just can't.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.334
I can't.
<i>No. You're doing great.</i>

20:05.465 --> 20:08.772
<i>Sam, I'm gonna need you to take
a deep breath for me, okay?</i>

20:08.903 --> 20:11.862
<i>In... and out.</i>

20:11.993 --> 20:13.734
<i>Look, I-I know
that this is a lot,</i>

20:13.864 --> 20:16.345
<i>but it's a miracle I got you.</i>

20:19.870 --> 20:21.350
Miracle?

20:21.481 --> 20:23.004
<i>Yes.</i>

20:23.134 --> 20:24.571
A miracle.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.879
Okay.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.925
<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

20:31.055 --> 20:33.406
Yes, I can.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.671
<i>Which way, Sam? Which way?</i>

20:37.801 --> 20:40.151
<i>Okay, stop.</i>

20:40.282 --> 20:42.153
The clearing's to your right.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.807
<i>Right. Okay. Any obstructions?</i>

20:43.938 --> 20:46.506
Um, yeah, there's a-a tree.
Step to your left.

20:46.636 --> 20:47.985
Good?

20:48.116 --> 20:49.770
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.426
<i>Okay, you're at the field now.</i>

20:53.556 --> 20:56.037
Great. What do you see?

20:56.167 --> 20:58.257
Is there a house?
Um, a landmark?

20:58.387 --> 21:00.868
- <i>A road anywhere?
- Uh...</i>

21:00.998 --> 21:03.523
<i>Um... stop.</i>

21:03.653 --> 21:07.048
I think I see a-a path
across the field.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.833
Great. Okay, let's go. Let's go.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.623
<i>Um, there hasn't been
any sign of him</i>

21:16.753 --> 21:18.320
<i>for a while,
which is good, but, um...</i>

21:18.451 --> 21:19.930
<i>I'll keep doing 360s in case,</i>

21:20.061 --> 21:21.845
<i>and if you see him,
you just have to</i>

21:21.976 --> 21:23.325
<i>give me a shout, okay,
and I'll just start running.</i>

21:23.456 --> 21:25.632
Oh, it sparkles.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.416
<i>And just make sure that
I don't trip on anything.</i>

21:27.547 --> 21:29.679
Hey, um, are you sure I can't

21:29.810 --> 21:31.202
<i>call, uh, family or friend,</i>

21:31.333 --> 21:33.074
<i>have them
call you back?</i>
What?

21:33.204 --> 21:35.729
<i>No. I haven't memorized
a number since middle school.</i>

21:35.859 --> 21:38.514
<i>Uh, it's just I'm at work,
and-and I am...</i>

21:38.645 --> 21:41.648
I'm so not good under stress, like...

21:41.778 --> 21:43.345
<i>Can you see your
own hands, Sam?</i>

21:43.476 --> 21:44.738
Yeah.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.261
Then you are
better-equipped than me.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.002
Right, uh--

21:48.132 --> 21:49.873
Please, listen. Um...

21:50.004 --> 21:51.658
God, I'm so jealous.

21:51.788 --> 21:55.226
<i>Uh, I-I've had shit eyes
since I was a kid.</i>

21:55.357 --> 21:57.403
<i>Do you know what they
used to called me back then?</i>

21:57.533 --> 21:59.100
Four Eyes?

21:59.230 --> 22:03.583
Nope. They would scream
"Missu Golightulee" at me.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.019
What's that?

22:05.149 --> 22:06.673
Bullshit in
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

22:06.803 --> 22:08.283
You never saw it?

22:08.414 --> 22:11.025
White actor in yellow face
with the taped-back eyes

22:11.155 --> 22:14.202
and, lucky for me, glasses.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.683
Yeah, yeah. I saw
clips on YouTube.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.337
It's-it's horrible.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.905
Yeah, I begged my mom for LASIK,
but I was too young.

22:22.036 --> 22:26.083
Then when I got older,
I chose not to get it,

22:26.214 --> 22:28.085
thinking that
people would take me

22:28.216 --> 22:30.914
more seriously as a doctor

22:31.045 --> 22:33.047
if I had glasses on.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.181
Pretty stupid decision
in hindsight, huh?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.621
You know, when
I was little,

22:41.751 --> 22:43.405
the kids playing
Power Rangers,

22:43.536 --> 22:47.104
they would make me
be Rita Repulsa.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.498
Oh, wait, is that
the evil lady with the staff?

22:49.629 --> 22:52.675
Yeah, and the nickname stuck
all the way through high school.

22:52.806 --> 22:56.113
Repulsa was written all
over my senior yearbook.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.464
God, kids can be such shit.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.943
Yeah.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.946
But hey, uh,
Rita was, like, a...

23:03.077 --> 23:06.036
a badass space witch, right?

23:06.167 --> 23:07.951
Yeah. I guess.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.780
Are you okay?

23:10.911 --> 23:13.304
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just, uh...

23:13.435 --> 23:16.003
Are we near the path yet?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.874
Oh, no.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.615
What?

23:19.746 --> 23:20.964
<i>I'm so sorry, Emily.</i>

23:21.095 --> 23:22.357
What is it?

23:22.488 --> 23:25.099
<i>It's not a path.</i>

23:25.229 --> 23:27.275
It's just a fallen tree.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.711
Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.452
How could I have thought
that that was a path?

23:30.583 --> 23:32.454
<i>What is... what is wrong
with me? I'm so sorry.</i>

23:32.585 --> 23:34.630
Nothing is wrong with you.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.590
Okay? It's fine.
Let's just keep going.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.636
Okay, but what if... what if I
missed sending you a better way?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.072
<i>You didn't lead me back</i>

23:42.203 --> 23:43.247
to the cabin, did you?

23:43.378 --> 23:44.510
No, no, but I--

23:44.640 --> 23:47.208
Hey, it's okay.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.166
What is it?

23:49.297 --> 23:52.300
My wrists are, uh, zip-tied,
and I'm losing circulation.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.693
I got to get 'em off.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.346
Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.218
And I didn't...
I didn't even realize.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.959
Okay. Uh, hold on.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.700
Let me see.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.485
<i>Okay, I'm gonna stop for
a sec here, so you just have to</i>

24:03.616 --> 24:07.489
check behind me to make sure
that he's not here, okay?

24:07.620 --> 24:09.578
<i>Oh, no.</i>
What?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.711
Is he there?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.626
<i>Did you see him?</i>
What? Oh, no.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.541
No, it's just my-my battery's
low, but don't worry.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.108
<i>Okay? I have a charger.</i>
Jesus. You scared me.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.849
Sorry. I'm sorry.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.721
<i>My phone was fully charged</i>

24:21.851 --> 24:23.592
<i>when I left for my run
this morning,</i>

24:23.723 --> 24:27.074
<i>but I have no idea
how much I have left now.</i>

24:27.204 --> 24:28.902
Damn it.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.730
Maybe if you find me,
like, a rock or something,

24:30.860 --> 24:32.775
I could, uh...

24:35.256 --> 24:36.257
Is that Russian?

24:36.387 --> 24:38.738
Uh, I think so. It's a video.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.236
I never imagined
getting murdered

24:59.367 --> 25:01.543
would feel so absurd.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.503
Hey, okay?

25:04.633 --> 25:06.548
No one is getting
murdered today.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.245
Now, Sergei says

25:08.376 --> 25:10.596
you need to use your teeth
to tighten the zip ties.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.163
Sergei says tighten 'em?

25:13.294 --> 25:15.383
Yeah. The tighter they are,
the easier they'll snap.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.603
Now, bring your hands
down to your knee

25:17.733 --> 25:19.300
as you bring
your knee up.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.650
You should probably
put the phone down.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.565
Okay.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.437
Okay. Yeah.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.004
Ready?

25:28.135 --> 25:31.051
One. Two. Three.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.406
<i>Emily?</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:40.408
Hold on. Hold on.
<i>Are you okay?</i>

25:40.539 --> 25:42.889
<i>I will be,
as long as he didn't hear me.</i>

25:43.019 --> 25:44.717
<i>Did the ties come off?</i>

25:44.847 --> 25:45.848
Yep.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.763
Yes! Sergei for the win.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.504
<i>Hey, but are-are you okay?</i>

25:49.635 --> 25:51.854
Uh, it cut me up, but there are

25:51.985 --> 25:53.334
no major blood vessels here,
so we're good.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.988
<i>Oh, no. You sure it's okay?</i>

25:55.118 --> 25:57.556
Yep. Perks of being
an ER doctor.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.993
Okay.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.777
Okay, let's go.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.431
Do you see anything else

26:03.562 --> 26:05.041
<i>around here
that looks promising?</i>

26:06.739 --> 26:08.479
I don't know.
I-I don't... It just...

26:08.610 --> 26:10.438
It all... it all looks the same.

26:26.106 --> 26:29.849
Hey. Uh, if you got
lost in the woods

26:29.979 --> 26:32.808
on one of your hunting trips,
what would you do?

26:33.853 --> 26:35.289
I wouldn't get lost.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.638
<i>Yeah, but if you did.</i>

26:36.769 --> 26:38.074
Hey, we-we got to go. Come on.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.467
One sec. Uh--

26:39.598 --> 26:40.903
Wouldn't happen.

26:41.034 --> 26:44.124
Right, but just...
just humor me, dude.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.691
I guess my best
bet would be

26:45.821 --> 26:48.476
to find a stream, river.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.783
Chances are it'll lead
me to civilization,

26:50.913 --> 26:52.349
if there's any around.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.568
Okay.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.745
In my belly.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.355
Hello?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.183
<i>One sec.</i>

27:00.314 --> 27:01.794
Four sixty-five.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.187
Four sixty-five for a dog?
That's highway robbery.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.278
Someone might've left
their card.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.803
Keep the change.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.853
Please don't come back.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.289
<i>What?</i>

27:19.420 --> 27:21.465
Okay, did you hear that?
About the water?

27:21.596 --> 27:24.555
Yeah, I heard, but, uh,
I left my divining rod at home.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.427
How do we find a stream, Sam?

27:26.557 --> 27:28.385
<i>Hold on.</i>

27:28.516 --> 27:30.866
Okay, it says that birds
can lead you to water.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.999
That, uh,
"in the evenings especially,

27:33.129 --> 27:35.479
following the flight path
of birds could lead you to H2O."

27:35.610 --> 27:38.874
Wait. I heard a flock of birds
fly above me a few minutes ago.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.920
Okay, great.
Uh, which way did they go?

27:43.792 --> 27:45.620
I think it's this way.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.101
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

28:05.422 --> 28:06.859
<i>Okay.</i>

28:06.989 --> 28:08.556
<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

28:10.732 --> 28:12.734
No sign of him.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.041
I think we might be safe
for a little bit.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.173
Just keep-keep walking, okay?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.307
Damn.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.178
It's starting
to get chilly.
<i>Where are you?</i>

28:22.309 --> 28:24.093
<i>It's lukewarm and humid here.</i>

28:24.224 --> 28:25.965
<i>You want
to trade?</i> Yeah.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.924
<i>Come on over, Sam.
Take my place.</i>

28:29.055 --> 28:30.621
Um, I'm in Michigan, I-I think.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.145
Unless he crossed state lines.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.755
<i>Where are you?</i>

28:36.018 --> 28:37.977
Uh, Florida.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.761
Oh, man.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.676
- Florida, beaches.
- Shit.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.809
Do you live
near the ocean?

28:43.939 --> 28:47.682
No, uh, Tallahassee is a
few hours from the ocean.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.423
Used to, though.

28:49.553 --> 28:53.383
Uh, Jacksonville's a couple
minutes from the water.

28:53.514 --> 28:54.994
I loved it.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.735
Why did you move away?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.346
A lot of things.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.393
Yeah.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.960
I can't believe
you're a doctor.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.919
You look so young.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.964
Yeah, it's the bane
of my existence, Sam.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.575
Even interns make
Doogie Howser jokes at me.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.621
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.405
Oh, it's okay.
When I'm 70, I'll look 40,

29:15.536 --> 29:17.146
and no one will
force me to retire.

29:19.105 --> 29:22.499
Can I, um... can I
ask you a question?

29:22.630 --> 29:24.937
Sure.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.853
What pushed you
to be a doctor?

29:27.983 --> 29:31.552
My mom is an ER nurse,
and she worked crazy hours, too.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.380
So when I was little,
I made this vow

29:33.510 --> 29:35.034
that I'd become a doctor

29:35.164 --> 29:36.600
<i>so that I could be
in the hospital, too,</i>

29:36.731 --> 29:38.341
<i>and we could spend
more time together.</i>

29:38.472 --> 29:40.561
<i>It didn't exactly turn out
that way, but, uh,</i>

29:40.691 --> 29:42.389
now I just...
I want to work really hard

29:42.519 --> 29:44.565
so that I can give her
an easier life, you know?

29:44.695 --> 29:46.393
That's really nice.

29:46.523 --> 29:50.266
Yeah, uh, but...

29:50.397 --> 29:52.312
you know, she...

29:52.442 --> 29:54.401
she hates flying alone, and...

29:54.531 --> 29:57.273
<i>and she kept asking me when I'd
be able to take time off work</i>

29:57.404 --> 30:00.711
<i>so that I could go with her
to visit my grandma in Japan.</i>

30:00.842 --> 30:04.890
But I never did.
I never did, and, uh...

30:05.020 --> 30:06.892
<i>You know, it's, like,
the only thing that my mom,</i>

30:07.022 --> 30:08.807
<i>like, ever asked of me ever,
and now...</i>

30:08.937 --> 30:11.026
I don't know...

30:11.157 --> 30:13.202
I don't know if I'm gonna, uh...

30:13.333 --> 30:14.769
No. Okay? No.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.510
Um, you're...

30:16.640 --> 30:18.512
you're gonna buy tickets
just as soon as you get back.

30:18.642 --> 30:19.948
Yeah.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.558
Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.301
<i>You said you were a cashier?</i>

30:25.432 --> 30:28.043
<i>Yeah, yeah, at this-this</i>

30:28.174 --> 30:31.394
really weird
gator-themed gas station.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.440
<i>It's a dream career.</i>
Hey, well,
at least it's--

30:33.570 --> 30:35.007
No. Uh-uh.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.269
No, don't try and make it
something it's not.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.880
<i>Okay? It's what was available.</i>

30:39.011 --> 30:40.403
Well, they need cashiers everywhere.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.188
<i>You could go back
to Jacksonville,</i>

30:42.318 --> 30:43.885
<i>work at a gas station
near the beach.</i>

30:44.016 --> 30:46.496
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I just, um,

30:46.627 --> 30:48.498
got to take care
of a few things first.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.109
<i>How long have you worked there?</i>

30:50.239 --> 30:52.111
Um, few years.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.635
I, uh... I moved back
to help my mom.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.245
And then she had
some health issues.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.899
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.553
Well, how's she doing now?

31:01.729 --> 31:03.818
She's not. She...

31:03.949 --> 31:06.299
She passed, so...

31:06.429 --> 31:09.084
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sam.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.999
But hey, you know,
that-that is admirable

31:11.130 --> 31:13.175
that you stopped your life
to help her. I mean,

31:13.306 --> 31:14.785
<i>I'm sure she's really grateful</i>

31:14.916 --> 31:16.744
<i>that you were there for her,
you know?</i>

31:16.875 --> 31:18.441
Yeah.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.443
Maybe, yeah.

31:20.574 --> 31:21.967
<i>Wait. Do you hear that?</i>

31:23.011 --> 31:24.447
I hear water.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.014
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

31:26.145 --> 31:27.711
Uh, not yet.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.800
Just keep going, okay?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.368
Okay.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.737
Well, I found a lot of water

31:53.868 --> 31:55.870
but not the kind
we're looking for.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.960
All right.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.222
<i>See anything?</i>

32:00.353 --> 32:02.137
Uh, not yet.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.573
Wait, wait.

32:03.704 --> 32:04.923
<i>I see it. Okay, there's...</i>

32:05.053 --> 32:06.402
<i>There's a river down below.</i>

32:06.533 --> 32:09.144
Oh, great work, Sam. Yes. Okay.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.016
<i>All right,
let's get me down there.</i>

32:11.146 --> 32:13.105
Okay.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.671
Hey, oh, um, careful.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.108
It's a drop-off.

32:16.238 --> 32:19.459
Um, let's just find
an easier spot,

32:19.589 --> 32:21.069
uh, for you
to climb down.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.375
Okay, okay.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.812
Tell me when
you see something, okay?

32:27.293 --> 32:29.077
Son of a bitch.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.732
<i>What?</i>

32:31.862 --> 32:34.909
No, no, no, no, no.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.259
Sam, Sam, is it still too steep?

32:39.435 --> 32:42.221
<i>Hey, Sam, Sam,
is it still too steep here?</i>

32:42.351 --> 32:43.962
Um, just-just hold on, okay?
Just--

32:44.092 --> 32:45.876
<i>Yeah?</i>

32:46.007 --> 32:48.705
Um, shit.
Just hold on one second, okay?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.274
<i>Ah, shit!</i>

32:52.405 --> 32:53.884
Shit.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.540
Emily, are you there?
Emily, I can't see you.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.283
Emily, are you okay?

33:01.414 --> 33:03.372
Oh, God.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.331
Ah, shit.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.463
Thank God. I can't see you.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.335
<i>I have my earbud,
but I dropped my phone.</i>

33:09.465 --> 33:10.989
<i>Where are you?</i>
Okay. Okay.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.687
Where are you, Sam?

33:13.817 --> 33:15.863
<i>Um, I'm...</i>

33:15.994 --> 33:18.170
I'm looking away from the river,
uh, towards the forest.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.303
Okay, um... God, I'm sorry.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.088
Okay, I was distracted. Okay.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.525
<i>I think I'm going away
from the river. Hold on.</i>

33:30.356 --> 33:32.053
Stay.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.229
Do you
see me yet?
<i>No, not yet.</i>

33:34.360 --> 33:36.188
Can you see any movement?

33:36.318 --> 33:37.537
No.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.582
I think I see
some grass or, um...

33:39.713 --> 33:40.975
There's a forest.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.977
I don't quite know.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.895
No, come on.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.158
Maybe if I just...

33:52.421 --> 33:53.683
Okay.

33:55.337 --> 33:56.817
Wait.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.645
I hear an engine.

33:58.775 --> 34:01.126
That's great. That's great.
Okay, let's go find 'em.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.172
I think he's here.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.131
Oh, no.

34:06.261 --> 34:07.958
Oh, no, no, no, no. I see him.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.830
<i>You're okay.</i>

34:09.960 --> 34:11.440
<i>To your left, to your left.</i>

34:11.571 --> 34:13.573

It's a video of me he took

36:07.034 --> 36:08.166
It's playing from his car.

<i>What? No, we can't drive a car.</i>

36:43.331 --> 36:45.420
We have to.
<i>Emily!</i>

36:45.551 --> 36:47.596
<i>Emily!</i>

36:51.905 --> 36:53.689
I'm up. I'm up.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.475
<i>Are you sure about this? Okay.</i>

36:56.605 --> 36:57.998
He could be back
at-at any minute,

36:58.128 --> 36:59.782
and then we should just
keep heading

36:59.913 --> 37:02.437
<i>downriver, just--</i>
We can't outrun
him, Sam.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.396
Yeah, but there's...
there-there is...

37:04.526 --> 37:06.789
there's no way that I'm gonna
be able to-to help you drive.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.008
You know, just, what if--

37:08.138 --> 37:10.837
Sam, where is his car?

37:16.582 --> 37:17.670
Right.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.020
Go right.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.718
Okay, you're headed
towards the driver's side.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.068
Just keep walking.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.592
Turn left for the door.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.637
Reach out.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.291
Did he leave his key
in the ignition?

37:30.422 --> 37:31.684
Yeah.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.816
Yes! What a fucking fool.

37:41.824 --> 37:42.869
He's here.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.698
He's here. Duck.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.569
Start the engine. Go. <i>Wait.</i>

37:47.700 --> 37:49.832
<i>Is he coming towards us
from the front?</i>

37:49.963 --> 37:51.617
Yeah, yeah. Start the car.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.227
Tell me when he's back
right in front of us.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.403
What? Why?

37:55.534 --> 37:57.362
If something happens, I don't
want him coming after me again.

37:57.492 --> 37:58.928
We have the advantage now.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.974
Let's just...
let's just stop him for good.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.106
What are you gonna do? Are you
gonna try and run him over?

38:03.237 --> 38:04.934
No, let's just go, okay?

38:05.065 --> 38:06.675
Tell me when he's here.

38:06.806 --> 38:07.981
Oh, my God, Emily.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.243
<i>Is he there?</i>

38:09.374 --> 38:10.592
Not yet.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
<i>Now?</i>
No.

38:22.430 --> 38:23.388
<i>Now!</i>

38:27.522 --> 38:29.437
<i>Oh, my God, you got him!</i>
Yes!

38:29.568 --> 38:31.396
<i>Wait. Stop. Brake! Brake!</i>

38:36.444 --> 38:38.403
Emily!

38:38.533 --> 38:39.969
<i>Emily!</i>

38:48.456 --> 38:51.633
<i>Emily, are you okay?</i>

38:51.764 --> 38:53.069
<i>Hello?</i>

38:53.200 --> 38:54.897
We got him, right?

38:55.028 --> 38:56.986
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Are you okay?</i>

38:57.117 --> 38:59.206
I mean, I'm alive.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.208
<i>Nothing's
- fractured.
- Okay.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:02.688
<i>Where are you?</i>

39:02.818 --> 39:05.343
Uh, uh, it flew onto the floor.

39:05.473 --> 39:08.563
<i>To your right. To your right.</i>

39:08.694 --> 39:10.913
<i>Did we kill him?</i>

39:11.044 --> 39:12.611
I don't know.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.395
<i>Here, look.</i>

39:15.440 --> 39:16.789
I can't see him.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.747
<i>I can't... I... Let's go.</i>

39:18.878 --> 39:20.401
<i>Emily!</i>
Okay, okay.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.577
<i>We got to go.</i>

39:22.708 --> 39:24.231
Sam.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.147
It-it's stuck, Sam.
It's... Fuck, it's stuck!

39:27.277 --> 39:29.062
<i>Shit!</i>
What's stuck?
What's stuck?

39:29.192 --> 39:30.716
Sam, the car, the car is stuck.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.153
What do we do?
<i>Oh, no.</i>

39:33.283 --> 39:35.155
<i>Shit. I don't know.</i>

39:38.288 --> 39:40.987
<i>What-what's going on?</i>

39:41.117 --> 39:43.772
<i>Sam, do you see anything sharp?</i>

39:43.903 --> 39:45.557
Uh...

39:45.687 --> 39:47.472
No?
<i>Uh, no.</i>

39:49.474 --> 39:50.562
How about here?

39:50.692 --> 39:52.302
Uh...

39:52.433 --> 39:54.827
I don't... I don't see anything.
Oh, wait, there.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.829
There's, uh, a piece of mirror
on the ground.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.961
Tell me when you see it.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.746
<i>It's right there,
right in front of you.</i>

40:00.876 --> 40:03.096
<i>Reach out. Be careful.
Careful, it's sharp.</i>

40:04.967 --> 40:06.055
You got it?
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:06.186 --> 40:07.796
Why-why... What are you--

40:07.927 --> 40:09.276
Do you see him?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.757
<i>Um... um...</i>

40:11.887 --> 40:14.150
Uh, uh...

40:14.281 --> 40:17.371
Just keep going around the car.

40:17.502 --> 40:18.764
<i>Do you see him now?</i>
He's there.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.156
There, on your left.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.202
Um, he's on the ground.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.247
Direct me to him, Sam.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.858
Emily, what are you doing?

40:25.988 --> 40:27.425
Let's go, okay?

40:27.555 --> 40:28.948
<i>Just go.</i>
I need to know
if he's dead.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.169
He's still breathing.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.694
Okay.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.347
<i>I'm gonna end this now.</i>

40:37.478 --> 40:39.175
Emily, what are you doing?

40:39.306 --> 40:42.918
You have no idea what this man
has put me through, Sam.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.616
Emily, this isn't you, okay?

40:44.746 --> 40:46.922
No, I don't... I don't know,
but let's just go, okay?

40:47.053 --> 40:48.228
If he just left me alone,
none of this would've happened.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.795
<i>No, but don't do it, Emily.</i>

40:49.925 --> 40:51.797
<i>Whatever you do,
don't do it. Just...</i>

40:51.927 --> 40:53.407
<i>I can get you out of here.
I got you, okay?</i>

40:53.538 --> 40:55.453
<i>Let's just get out of here. Emily...</i>

40:55.583 --> 40:56.715
Emily, he's moving. Please.

40:56.845 --> 40:58.325
<i>Emily, Emily.</i>

40:58.456 --> 40:59.935
<i>Emily, please. Emily.</i>

41:01.284 --> 41:03.461
<i>Emily, he's moving. Please!</i>

41:04.679 --> 41:06.202
Okay.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.421
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.075
You're right.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.033
<i>But I'm keeping this
just in case, okay?</i>

41:12.470 --> 41:13.862
Okay. Okay. <i>Now...</i>

41:13.993 --> 41:16.038
Which way? Which way?

41:16.169 --> 41:17.736
Um, uh, let me see.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.564
Okay, let's, um...

41:19.694 --> 41:21.740
<i>T-To your right, okay?
Just keep going straight.</i>

41:21.870 --> 41:23.872
<i>It's clear for a while.
We'll just... we'll walk</i>

41:24.003 --> 41:25.526
<i>above the river,
okay?</i>
Okay.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.267
<i>He looked really hurt.
We're safe for now.</i>

41:27.397 --> 41:28.442
<i>Just keep going.</i>

41:28.573 --> 41:29.965
Okay.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.707
Fuck.

41:32.838 --> 41:33.969
Oh, fuck.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.536
<i>What did you say?</i>

41:35.667 --> 41:37.364
Emily, uh...

41:37.495 --> 41:39.279
Emily, I'm gonna have to, uh...

41:39.409 --> 41:41.107
<i>What?</i>
Ah, shit.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.979
Uh, I'm gonna have to start
making some calls.

41:44.110 --> 41:45.590
To do... to do what, Sam?

41:45.720 --> 41:47.243
<i>To find another phone.</i>

41:47.374 --> 41:49.332
<i>I broke mine.
I can't charge it anymore.</i>

41:49.463 --> 41:51.160
What do you mean,
you broke your phone?

41:51.291 --> 41:53.380
<i>It snapped. I--</i>
When?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.904
Earlier. You fell, and then he--

41:56.035 --> 41:57.253
So, why didn't you
tell me earlier?

41:57.384 --> 41:58.777
Why didn't you tell me
when I fell?

41:58.907 --> 41:59.995
Emily, the charger
broke off on the phone,

42:00.126 --> 42:01.867
and now it-it's stuck, okay?

42:01.997 --> 42:03.216
How could that even happen?

42:03.346 --> 42:04.913
<i>I... I don't know. Oh.</i>

42:05.044 --> 42:06.524
Oh, shit, there's a stump.

42:06.654 --> 42:07.829
<i>Step.</i>

42:07.960 --> 42:09.657
Okay.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.094
Is there somebody at your work
who can lend you a phone?

42:12.225 --> 42:13.574
Uh, no. No, I'm alone.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.097
<i>A friend that can bring
you one?</i>

42:15.228 --> 42:16.316
Shit. No, let me think.

42:16.446 --> 42:17.752
Let me think. Let me think.

42:17.883 --> 42:19.188
Oh, fuck.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.494
Um...

42:20.625 --> 42:22.844
No, no.

42:25.064 --> 42:28.502
<i>♪ She'll put you
Under her spell ♪</i>

42:28.633 --> 42:31.984
<i>♪ 'Cause she's
Batshit crazy...♪</i>

42:33.725 --> 42:35.422
Shit.

43:11.545 --> 43:13.373
<i>♪ She'll send you
Straight to hell... ♪</i>

43:13.503 --> 43:14.809
Shit.

43:17.812 --> 43:19.335
Hey, uh, Emily.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.163
Okay, quick,
give me your number.

43:21.294 --> 43:22.687
Did you get a phone?

43:22.817 --> 43:24.514
I will in a sec,
okay, but if my phone dies,

43:24.645 --> 43:25.907
I need your number. <i>Okay.</i>

43:26.038 --> 43:29.476
Eight, one, zero,
one, four, seven,

43:29.607 --> 43:32.087
<i>zero, one, eight, five.</i>

43:32.218 --> 43:33.436
Eight, five. Okay.

43:33.567 --> 43:35.438
All right. Got it.

43:35.569 --> 43:37.223
Okay. My eyes might
have to leave you

43:37.353 --> 43:39.225
for a second, okay,
so be careful.

43:39.355 --> 43:41.357
I'm gonna try and borrow
this woman's phone.

43:41.488 --> 43:43.142
<i>Oh, no, Sam, Sam.</i>
What?

43:43.272 --> 43:44.273
Sam, I hear footsteps.

43:44.404 --> 43:46.014
He's already caught up.

43:46.145 --> 43:48.103
No. Already? Okay, show me.

43:48.234 --> 43:50.497
No. Not the '98.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.412
He was saving that
for the mayor's gala.

43:52.542 --> 43:53.848
The '03 Château Margaux.

43:53.979 --> 43:55.284
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

43:55.415 --> 43:57.373
Hey. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

43:57.504 --> 43:59.941
You were so rude earlier
that I left my Amex.

44:00.072 --> 44:01.290
Um, just give me a moment, okay?

44:01.421 --> 44:02.770
Absolutely not.

44:02.901 --> 44:04.685
I am missing my
<i>fête de yacht</i>

44:04.816 --> 44:07.035
because of you, because
of how rude you were.

44:07.166 --> 44:09.037
You probably don't speak French,
but that means "yacht party."

44:09.168 --> 44:10.648
Okay, just give me
one second, okay?

44:10.778 --> 44:13.259
There is a woman
who is about to get murdered.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.695
What kind of crack
are you smoking?

44:14.826 --> 44:16.610
Shit!

44:16.741 --> 44:18.481
Shit, Emily! He's headed
straight for you, okay?

44:18.612 --> 44:20.440
<i>Turn around! Go! Go!
He has a gun!</i>

44:20.570 --> 44:22.181
Which way?
<i>He's headed straight
for you!</i>

44:22.311 --> 44:23.835
Excuse me.
Turn around!
Turn around! Go!

44:23.965 --> 44:25.488
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Go! He's got a gun, Emily!

44:25.619 --> 44:26.794
Straight. Straight. Yeah, stop.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

44:26.925 --> 44:28.317
Excuse me, I'm standing
in front of you.

44:28.448 --> 44:29.797
I'm a customer.

44:29.928 --> 44:31.103
A paying customer.
No. No, no. No, no.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.365
No!
What could be
more important

44:32.495 --> 44:34.019
than what-- Hey!
No! Emily, no!

44:34.149 --> 44:35.977
Sam?

44:36.108 --> 44:38.240
Sam, Sam, Sam.

44:46.292 --> 44:47.989
<i>Excuse me.</i>

44:49.208 --> 44:50.644
Hey. Go get my card.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.777
Hey. Can-can-can I use
your phone, please?

44:52.907 --> 44:55.344
You think I'm gonna
let you touch this? Ew. No.

44:55.475 --> 44:56.955
Please. There...
there is a woman.

44:57.085 --> 44:58.478
I answered her call today--

44:58.608 --> 45:01.568
All of this, I don't
give a shit about, okay?

45:01.699 --> 45:04.092
Just scurry back into your
cage and get me my card.

45:04.223 --> 45:05.790
What now?

45:05.920 --> 45:07.095
Please.

45:07.226 --> 45:09.445
Please.
Go.

45:09.576 --> 45:12.710
Well, just slow down.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.669
Oh, that...
that is bullshit.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.454
Oh, fuck wind speed.
You tell that driver

45:18.585 --> 45:21.022
he is not weaseling out of this
just to keep our deposit.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.373
You're a...

45:24.504 --> 45:26.549
Do you know what that means?
That's "shithead" in French.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.508
Cut off some of
the Williams Sonoma cheese,

45:28.638 --> 45:29.552
but don't eat any

45:29.683 --> 45:30.597
until I get back.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.641
I'll be there in ten.

45:34.949 --> 45:36.690
Little bitch! Fucking...

45:39.998 --> 45:41.608
Okay.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.614
Fucking trailer trash cunt!

45:47.745 --> 45:49.398
Give that back to me now!

45:49.529 --> 45:52.010
Eat all the Williams Sonoma
cheese you want.

46:24.694 --> 46:27.959
You know, in the wild,

46:28.089 --> 46:30.657
there are these, uh,
pack hunters.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.269
Animals that rely
on others to live.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.489
But, you see,
I have always seen myself--

46:36.619 --> 46:38.491
Shut up!

46:38.621 --> 46:40.754
Shut the fuck up!

46:40.885 --> 46:43.191
I am so sick of your blah,

46:43.322 --> 46:44.627
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah!

46:44.758 --> 46:47.195
No one wants
to hear you talk, Charlie.

46:47.326 --> 46:48.980
I mean, you think
of yourself as

46:49.110 --> 46:50.720
this modern-day
alpha male philosopher?

46:50.851 --> 46:52.853
Well, you're
just a spoiled,

46:52.984 --> 46:56.683
rich trust-fund kid
that parrots back bad TED Talks.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.903
Yeah! They're bad!

47:01.775 --> 47:03.211
I called 911.

47:03.342 --> 47:04.778
They have your name.

47:04.909 --> 47:06.432
They're tracking
my location,

47:06.562 --> 47:08.521
and they're on their way
right now.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.743
What, are you still gonna
go through with this?

47:13.874 --> 47:15.441
You're gonna get
caught, Charlie.

47:15.571 --> 47:17.573
Sure.

47:17.704 --> 47:19.967
But there's a difference
between getting caught

47:20.098 --> 47:21.926
and being convicted.

47:25.190 --> 47:28.236
You don't get to do this to me

47:28.367 --> 47:29.890
and get away with it.

47:41.597 --> 47:44.252
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

47:44.383 --> 47:45.775
I don't care, Charlie.

47:45.906 --> 47:47.212
I don't care.

47:47.342 --> 47:49.431
Kill me if you want, but you,

47:49.562 --> 47:51.869
you do not get to murder me
and play the victim.

47:52.913 --> 47:53.958
I am the victim.

47:54.088 --> 47:56.003
Are you kidding me?

47:56.134 --> 47:57.483
No, the victim
of your abandonment.

47:57.613 --> 47:58.614
Neglect.
My--

47:58.745 --> 48:00.094
After I gave you everything.

48:00.225 --> 48:01.704
The romantic surprises,

48:01.835 --> 48:03.968
the trips,
the emotional support.

48:04.098 --> 48:06.971
Are you forgetting the jealousy?

48:07.101 --> 48:09.321
Are you forgetting
the stalking?

48:09.451 --> 48:11.540
The holes in my wall?
The bruises?

48:11.671 --> 48:13.455
Well, you pushed me there.

48:13.586 --> 48:15.022
Look, how am I supposed to feel

48:15.153 --> 48:16.850
when you would rather spend
100-hour weeks

48:16.981 --> 48:19.635
with disgusting sick people
than with me?

48:19.766 --> 48:22.116
But you're so addicted
to the validation

48:22.247 --> 48:24.162
that you get at work--
I am not.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.992
What you will never understand, Charlie,

48:28.122 --> 48:30.124
is that some people do things

48:30.255 --> 48:32.692
for other things
besides validation.

48:32.822 --> 48:34.999
I work my fucking ass off
so that my mom

48:35.129 --> 48:36.348
can have a better life.
Your mom?

48:36.478 --> 48:38.350
It's not for your mom!

48:38.480 --> 48:41.266
God, how many times
did I see you ignore her calls?

48:41.396 --> 48:43.094
You see, the truth is, Em--

48:43.224 --> 48:44.747
Do not call me that.

48:46.488 --> 48:49.578
You've convinced yourself
that you work so much

48:49.709 --> 48:51.754
to be a good daughter,

48:51.885 --> 48:54.975
but it actually makes you
a fucking horrible one.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.759
A horrible daughter

48:56.890 --> 49:00.938
and a completely neglectful
partner to me.

49:04.245 --> 49:07.683
This is what you do, Charlie.

49:07.814 --> 49:10.643
You find what hurts in people,

49:10.773 --> 49:12.558
and then... and then...

49:12.688 --> 49:14.603
and then you use it
like a weapon.

49:15.865 --> 49:17.563
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

49:31.446 --> 49:32.491
Stop.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.015
No! Stop!

49:48.724 --> 49:50.683
Fuck!

49:56.602 --> 49:59.213
Hey, fuck. I want my fucking
phone back, you bitch.

49:59.344 --> 50:02.086
For the last time,
it's an emergency.

50:02.216 --> 50:03.696
Whose fucking emergency is it?

50:03.826 --> 50:05.306
It's not my emergency.

50:05.437 --> 50:07.395
My emergency is that
you took my fucking phone!

50:07.526 --> 50:09.745
I'm not afraid of you.

50:11.051 --> 50:12.879
All right.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.882
You want a fucking war?

50:16.013 --> 50:17.536
You got one.

50:19.755 --> 50:22.062
You better start
fucking praying.

50:30.070 --> 50:31.332
Okay.

50:33.595 --> 50:35.467
Fuck. I thought
it was in this one.

50:38.165 --> 50:39.688
No, no, no, no, no.

50:51.483 --> 50:53.050
Nobody does this to me.

51:22.470 --> 51:25.604
Where are you, you gator fuck?

51:28.215 --> 51:30.217
Come out, come out.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.439
You hiding from me?
Shit. Shit.

51:34.569 --> 51:36.223
Got a little surprise
for you. Okay.

51:37.137 --> 51:39.444
Don't shoot, okay?

51:39.574 --> 51:41.533
I can't afford to get shot.
I don't have insurance.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.536
You deserve a bullet for putting
your filthy hands on my phone.

51:44.666 --> 51:47.365
That case costs more
than you make in a year.

51:47.495 --> 51:49.106
It's 24-karat gold.
Now, hand it over.

51:50.498 --> 51:52.935
Okay.
Now!

51:53.066 --> 51:54.241
No, not on the f--

51:54.372 --> 51:56.678
You fuck!

52:07.254 --> 52:09.126
Okay. Okay.

52:11.650 --> 52:13.434
Okay.

52:14.740 --> 52:18.047
What? What does it say?

52:58.087 --> 53:00.089
Call Hubby Wubby.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.874
Fuck. Okay.

53:41.087 --> 53:43.002
<i>We're sorry.</i>

53:43.132 --> 53:45.134
<i>Your call cannot
be completed.</i> Okay.

53:45.265 --> 53:47.789
Eight, one, zero,

53:47.920 --> 53:51.097
one, four, seven,
zero, one, five, five.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.055
Okay. Uh...

53:55.188 --> 53:57.321
Man, what the hell? Okay, um...

53:57.451 --> 53:59.410
Three, eight. Three, eight.

54:00.454 --> 54:02.543
Okay. Okay.

54:02.674 --> 54:04.850
Call. Okay.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.199
Okay. Okay.

54:06.330 --> 54:07.374
<i>Yello?</i>

54:07.505 --> 54:08.723
Seriously?

54:08.854 --> 54:10.725
Eight, five.

54:16.514 --> 54:19.343
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

54:43.410 --> 54:45.325
<i>Emily?</i>

54:45.456 --> 54:46.848
<i>Sam?</i>

54:46.979 --> 54:48.676
<i>You found a phone.</i>

54:48.807 --> 54:51.026
Thank God.
Are you okay?
<i>Not great.</i>

54:51.157 --> 54:52.593
<i>I lost my earbud.</i>

54:52.724 --> 54:54.595
Um, can you get up?
Okay, we got to go.

54:54.726 --> 54:56.423
We got to do the 360, okay?

54:57.598 --> 54:59.948
It's dark.

55:00.079 --> 55:01.472
<i>Now we both can't see.</i>

55:01.602 --> 55:02.995
Yeah, I can... I can...

55:03.125 --> 55:04.518
I can still spot his flashlight,
though, right?

55:04.649 --> 55:07.173
I'm just gonna lay here
until he finds me.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.870
No, your phone,
it has a flashlight.

55:09.001 --> 55:11.046
I can walk you through,
uh, turning it on, okay?

55:11.177 --> 55:13.005
You're just gonna--

55:13.135 --> 55:15.964
That would just make it
easier for him to spot me.

55:16.095 --> 55:18.010
Okay. Okay.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.099
So, um... so, what
are we gonna do?

55:20.229 --> 55:22.101
Hey.

55:22.231 --> 55:23.972
- Sam?
- Yeah?

55:24.103 --> 55:27.541
None of this is
your fault, okay?

55:27.672 --> 55:29.848
I asked you to do
a pretty impossible thing.

55:29.978 --> 55:31.719
And I'm sorry.

55:31.850 --> 55:34.331
No, Emily. No, no, no,
no, you can't, okay?

55:34.461 --> 55:36.245
I need you to call
someone for me.

55:36.376 --> 55:39.118
Can you do that, Sam?
No. No, let's just...

55:39.248 --> 55:41.294
Let's keep going, right?
Let's keep going.

55:41.425 --> 55:44.558
Call the landline
and put it on speaker.

55:44.689 --> 55:46.952
No, let's just go.
Okay? Let's just go.

55:47.082 --> 55:49.955
The number is...

55:50.085 --> 55:53.306
eight, one, zero,
one, two, six,

55:53.437 --> 55:56.353
zero, one, nine, seven.

56:00.487 --> 56:03.490
Hey. I thought you hadn't
memorized any numbers

56:03.621 --> 56:05.362
since middle school.

56:05.492 --> 56:07.538
<i>Yeah, well,
sometimes it's easier</i>

56:07.668 --> 56:10.323
<i>to show a stranger
how much you fucked up.</i>

56:12.978 --> 56:14.632
Please...

56:14.762 --> 56:16.982
don't make me ask you again.

56:31.953 --> 56:33.390
<i>Hello?</i>

56:35.914 --> 56:37.611
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

56:37.742 --> 56:39.918
<i>Em, what's this number
you're calling from?</i>

56:40.048 --> 56:43.356
My friend's phone.
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

56:43.487 --> 56:45.010
I'm sorry.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.578
<i>For what?</i>
I...

56:47.708 --> 56:50.581
You were right,
and I should've listened to you,

56:50.711 --> 56:54.236
and I'm... I'm sorry
that I got mad at you.

56:54.367 --> 56:55.803
<i>What has he done to you?</i>

56:55.934 --> 56:58.415
<i>Deep down, I think that I knew</i>

56:58.545 --> 57:02.331
that you were right,
but I indulged anyway.

57:02.462 --> 57:04.159
<i>Em, where are you?</i>

57:04.290 --> 57:07.032
<i>I'm sorry that
I didn't come see you more.</i>

57:07.162 --> 57:08.642
<i>That I didn't take off work.</i>

57:10.383 --> 57:11.906
<i>I always made excuses.</i>

57:12.037 --> 57:13.473
<i>I'm going to come get you.</i>

57:13.604 --> 57:15.170
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

57:15.301 --> 57:17.259
I love you so much, Mom.

57:17.390 --> 57:19.261
<i>Tell me where you are, Em.</i>

57:19.392 --> 57:21.786
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

57:21.916 --> 57:24.528
<i>Thank you for everything.
Thank you for...</i>

57:24.658 --> 57:27.618
<i>for making me strong,
and I'm sorry.</i>

57:27.748 --> 57:30.490
<i>Emily, tell me what's going on.</i>

57:30.621 --> 57:34.015
<i>This is probably the last time
that we're gonna...</i>

57:35.016 --> 57:35.930
A light.

57:36.061 --> 57:37.802
Emily.

57:37.932 --> 57:41.022
<i>Emily, there's a light.</i>

57:41.153 --> 57:42.589
<i>A light went on behind you,
okay?</i>

57:42.720 --> 57:43.982
<i>It could be a house.</i>

57:44.112 --> 57:45.549
<i>Em, what's happening?</i>

57:45.679 --> 57:47.246
<i>We can get to it. It's not far.</i>

57:47.376 --> 57:49.291
I don't know.

57:49.422 --> 57:51.293
Just get up, okay?

57:51.424 --> 57:52.817
Just get up.

57:52.947 --> 57:55.428
<i>I can barely stand now, Sam.</i>

57:58.649 --> 58:00.346
Emily.

58:01.956 --> 58:04.045
You know how...

58:04.176 --> 58:07.266
You know how you said
that you're sure...

58:07.396 --> 58:09.486
you're so sure
that my mom was happy

58:09.616 --> 58:11.531
I was there with her
when she passed?

58:11.662 --> 58:13.620
Yeah.

58:16.231 --> 58:18.843
I wasn't there.

58:18.973 --> 58:20.932
Okay, I needed...
I needed a break.

58:21.062 --> 58:22.934
I needed a break from her
and from her sickness,

58:23.064 --> 58:24.762
and so I went out
and I got drunk,

58:24.892 --> 58:27.678
and I left and...

58:27.808 --> 58:29.810
By the time
I got back home, I...

58:30.985 --> 58:32.770
Shit.

58:34.946 --> 58:38.166
I left her, and she...

58:38.297 --> 58:40.647
<i>died, okay?</i>

58:40.778 --> 58:43.476
<i>And I wanted
to leave you tonight, too,</i>

58:43.607 --> 58:45.652
<i>so bad, okay?</i>

58:45.783 --> 58:48.002
<i>I was... scared.</i>

58:48.133 --> 58:52.311
But you, you asked me to stay.

58:52.441 --> 58:55.270
Okay? So I stayed, right?

58:55.401 --> 58:57.142
And now what? What?

58:57.272 --> 59:00.885
You're just gonna...
you're gonna give up?

59:01.015 --> 59:03.888
No, no.
No, you are not allowed, okay?

59:04.018 --> 59:07.544
<i>You, you are not allowed
to give up.</i>

59:07.674 --> 59:09.241
<i>Em, who is that?</i>

59:10.938 --> 59:12.244
It's Sam, Mom.

59:12.374 --> 59:14.551
<i>Who's Sam?</i>
She's my friend.

59:14.681 --> 59:18.555
<i>Oh. Then listen to Sam.</i>

59:18.685 --> 59:20.121
<i>Goddamn it, get up. Em, get up!</i>

59:20.252 --> 59:21.253
Just get up.

59:21.383 --> 59:22.428
I can't.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.299
Get up.

59:24.430 --> 59:25.649
<i>Get up.</i>
<i>Emily,
you can do it.</i>

59:25.779 --> 59:27.215
He's gonna find me
no matter what I do.

59:27.346 --> 59:28.826
He's gonna...
he's gonna find me.

59:28.956 --> 59:30.654
<i>No, no.
Emily, I'm not gonna leave you.</i>

59:30.784 --> 59:32.177
<i>Just get up.</i>
<i>Come on, honey.
Get up.</i>

59:32.307 --> 59:35.441
Okay, you just...
you just have to get up.

59:35.572 --> 59:38.400
<i>Okay? I am right here.
I didn't leave.</i>

59:38.531 --> 59:39.750
I'm right here.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.578
Okay? Go. Just get up.

59:42.666 --> 59:44.102
<i>Just get up, please.</i>

59:44.232 --> 59:46.626
Is there really a light?

59:46.757 --> 59:49.281
Yes, yes, yes.
<i>You can
do this, okay?</i>

59:49.411 --> 59:51.065
<i>Listen to your friend.
She's gonna help you.</i>

59:51.196 --> 59:53.067
<i>Just come home.</i>

59:53.198 --> 59:54.503
I think maybe I see it.

59:54.634 --> 59:56.680
<i>It's there. Okay, trust me.</i>

59:56.810 --> 59:58.725
Okay.

59:58.856 --> 1:00:00.945
Okay, Sam.

1:00:01.075 --> 1:00:02.816
Lead me to the light.

1:00:02.947 --> 1:00:04.731
<i>Yes! Honey, go.</i>

1:00:04.862 --> 1:00:06.385
<i>You can do it.</i>

1:00:20.921 --> 1:00:22.619
Sam?

1:00:22.749 --> 1:00:26.448
<i>Yeah, we're almost there.
Just keep going.</i>

1:00:26.579 --> 1:00:28.363
<i>I see it. Right up ahead.</i>

1:00:28.494 --> 1:00:30.931
What is it?
<i>It's a barn.</i>

1:00:31.062 --> 1:00:33.586
<i>Okay, let's see if there's
a house nearby. Scan.</i>

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:34.805
Okay.

1:00:35.849 --> 1:00:37.155
Shit.

1:00:37.285 --> 1:00:38.678
I see his flashlight.
Turn around.

1:00:38.809 --> 1:00:40.288
Get in the barn.

1:00:41.594 --> 1:00:43.770
<i>Straight. It's in front of you.</i>

1:00:48.732 --> 1:00:50.559
All right, what do you see?

1:00:50.690 --> 1:00:51.996
I need a weapon.

1:00:52.126 --> 1:00:55.086
Uh, I see hay, shelves,

1:00:55.216 --> 1:00:57.392
some-some sort of chemicals,

1:00:57.523 --> 1:01:00.700
um, uh, uh, stairs going up.

1:01:00.831 --> 1:01:03.137
What, no pitchfork? Axe? Gun?

1:01:03.268 --> 1:01:05.096
No. No, not yet.

1:01:05.226 --> 1:01:07.315
God. What else is there?

1:01:11.624 --> 1:01:13.191
What is that?

1:01:24.202 --> 1:01:25.943
What the fuck?

1:01:54.406 --> 1:01:56.800
<i>Sam, what's wrong?</i>

1:02:00.978 --> 1:02:02.196
Sam.

1:02:02.327 --> 1:02:03.763
He's close.

1:02:03.894 --> 1:02:05.025
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

1:02:06.984 --> 1:02:09.116
Sam, are you there? Hello?

1:02:09.247 --> 1:02:10.465
Shit.

1:02:10.596 --> 1:02:12.293
Okay. You need to hide. <i>Okay.</i>

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:14.905
All right, which way?
Anything look good?

1:02:15.035 --> 1:02:16.428
<i>Um, go to your...
go to your right.</i>

1:02:16.558 --> 1:02:17.951
<i>Your right, behind that shelf.</i>

1:02:27.874 --> 1:02:29.310
<i>Sam? Hello?</i>

1:02:29.441 --> 1:02:32.226
<i>Is there anything here?</i>

1:02:32.357 --> 1:02:33.924
<i>Hello? Sam.</i>

1:02:37.884 --> 1:02:39.973
Holy shit.
What?

1:02:45.239 --> 1:02:47.154
Oh, God.
<i>What happened?
What happened?</i>

1:02:49.461 --> 1:02:52.333
Let us in, little bitch.

1:02:52.464 --> 1:02:53.726
Go away!

1:02:53.857 --> 1:02:56.816
Sam, what is happening
over there?

1:02:56.947 --> 1:02:58.862
Open this fucking door!

1:02:58.992 --> 1:03:00.689
There-there is a couple here,

1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:03.823
and, well, they...
they have guns.

1:03:03.954 --> 1:03:05.694
What do you... what do you mean,
they have guns?

1:03:05.825 --> 1:03:07.131
I took this woman's phone

1:03:07.261 --> 1:03:09.089
to call you, and...
Let us in!

1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:10.917
...her and her husband,
well, they are not

1:03:11.048 --> 1:03:12.745
happy about it, okay?

1:03:12.876 --> 1:03:15.530
You ruined my <i>fête de yacht!</i>

1:03:15.661 --> 1:03:17.706
Oh, my God.
You will pay
for that!

1:03:17.837 --> 1:03:21.275
<i>Sam, if they have guns,
you have to call the police.</i>

1:03:21.406 --> 1:03:24.670
No, no, no, no. I really...
I really did steal the phone,

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:27.064
so, um, you know, if, uh...
if I call the police,

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:28.717
they're gonna come
and they're gonna...

1:03:28.848 --> 1:03:29.980
<i>they would take it away
from me.</i>

1:03:30.110 --> 1:03:31.503
<i>I need you safe first.</i>

1:03:31.633 --> 1:03:33.157
Move back.
Okay, baby.

1:03:38.162 --> 1:03:39.728
Oh, shit.

1:03:42.993 --> 1:03:43.994
Sam.

1:03:47.301 --> 1:03:49.260
What happened? What happened?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1:03:49.390 --> 1:03:51.131
I just, um...
Uh, why don't you, uh,

1:03:51.262 --> 1:03:52.480
keep showing me
the shelves, okay?

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:53.655
Just show me the shelves.

1:03:53.786 --> 1:03:54.874
<i>Okay.</i>

1:03:55.005 --> 1:03:56.397
<i>Okay. Anything here?</i>

1:03:56.528 --> 1:03:57.834
No, no, no. Nothing.

1:04:02.012 --> 1:04:03.404
Give me the phone.

1:04:03.535 --> 1:04:05.363
Give her the phone back!
Give us the phone!

1:04:05.493 --> 1:04:08.235
You want to catch one
right between the eyes?

1:04:10.411 --> 1:04:11.935
<i>Give her
the fucking phone back!</i>

1:04:12.065 --> 1:04:13.675
<i>Give us the phone!</i>

1:04:13.806 --> 1:04:16.069
Look at you,
you fucking ugly piece of shit!

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.636
Sam.

1:04:18.767 --> 1:04:20.073
What is this?

1:04:20.204 --> 1:04:23.424
Uh...
Give me the phone.

1:04:23.555 --> 1:04:25.644
Do you hear him, bitch?
Give him the phone!

1:04:25.774 --> 1:04:26.993
Give me the phone.

1:04:27.124 --> 1:04:29.169
I have an idea.

1:04:36.002 --> 1:04:37.961
What in God's green fuck
is going on here?

1:04:38.091 --> 1:04:39.527
Hey!

1:04:39.658 --> 1:04:41.486
I own this establishment,
you sons of-- Whoa.

1:04:44.358 --> 1:04:45.838
Your cunt employee

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:48.319
snagged my new phone,
and I want it back now!

1:04:48.449 --> 1:04:49.842
Uh, uh, m-my deepest apologies.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:51.017
N-N-N-Now! Get up!
Okay. All right.

1:04:51.148 --> 1:04:52.584
Yes, ma'am.

1:04:52.714 --> 1:04:54.064
She's been nothing
but a nuisance.

1:04:54.194 --> 1:04:55.630
I never should've hired her.

1:04:55.761 --> 1:04:56.936
Now!

1:04:57.067 --> 1:04:58.546
Yes.

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:01.593
Devereaux!

1:05:01.723 --> 1:05:03.943
Open up now.

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:07.904
<i>Ready?</i>

1:05:08.034 --> 1:05:09.209
I think so.

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:11.124
Devereaux!
Stupid redneck.

1:05:11.255 --> 1:05:12.821
You can't even
control one employee?

1:05:12.952 --> 1:05:14.432
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Let's go!

1:05:14.562 --> 1:05:16.564
Okay. All right. Hey, Devereaux,
I'm calling the cops.

1:05:16.695 --> 1:05:18.784
Your ass is going to jail!

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:20.742
Sometime today.
Come on!
Hello?

1:05:20.873 --> 1:05:22.092
I got some trash

1:05:22.222 --> 1:05:24.094
<i>that needs taking out.</i>

1:05:24.224 --> 1:05:25.486
Sam, he's gonna hear

1:05:25.617 --> 1:05:27.053
all the noise coming
from over there.

1:05:27.184 --> 1:05:28.794
Hey, ball sack,
let's go!

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:30.883
Sam, you got to stop
the noise.
Open up. Open up now!

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:32.537
You better get in
there right now!

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:34.626
I want this bitch!

1:05:34.756 --> 1:05:37.107
Fuck it!

1:05:37.237 --> 1:05:38.369
Let's go!

1:05:38.499 --> 1:05:39.413
He's gonna hear.

1:05:39.544 --> 1:05:41.285
<i>I know, I know, okay?</i>

1:05:41.415 --> 1:05:43.200
I got to think.
I got to think.
Motherfucker!

1:05:43.330 --> 1:05:44.766
What the...
Come on, asshole.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

1:05:44.897 --> 1:05:47.465
Get in there.
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

1:05:47.595 --> 1:05:50.033
Okay.

1:05:50.163 --> 1:05:51.817
Okay, okay. Okay.

1:05:51.948 --> 1:05:53.340
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:54.907
- I can mute myself.
- What?

1:05:55.038 --> 1:05:56.735
But-but how will I know
when it's time?

1:05:56.865 --> 1:05:59.390
No, no, no. I will send you
a text when he's in the spot.

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:01.000
You'll hear a ping.

1:06:01.131 --> 1:06:02.741
But what if he doesn't go
to the spot, Sam?

1:06:02.871 --> 1:06:04.656
I can't know what's happening

1:06:04.786 --> 1:06:06.788
if you can't talk to me.
Hey, hey. We just
have to trust

1:06:06.919 --> 1:06:08.355
that it's gonna work.
But-but-but...

1:06:08.486 --> 1:06:09.878
Just, I have to
mute myself, okay?

1:06:11.141 --> 1:06:12.577
- No.
- This is gonna work.

1:06:12.707 --> 1:06:14.405
It's gonna work, okay?

1:06:14.535 --> 1:06:16.363
He is not gonna beat us.
Come on,
get in there!

1:06:16.494 --> 1:06:20.019
Open the fuck up!

1:06:25.459 --> 1:06:27.548
Sam.

1:06:27.679 --> 1:06:29.289
<i>Oh, G--</i>

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:12.680
There you go.

1:07:12.811 --> 1:07:14.552
Get in there.
We're coming for you.

1:07:14.682 --> 1:07:16.597
That's right!

1:07:16.728 --> 1:07:18.121
Come on, come on.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:20.922
Get him, Emily!

1:08:23.708 --> 1:08:25.013
Yes! Yes!

1:08:30.802 --> 1:08:32.891
<i>Get him, Emily!
Push him over the edge!</i>

1:08:33.021 --> 1:08:34.980
<i>Push him harder! Go!</i>

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.851
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1:08:36.982 --> 1:08:38.636
Push him! Harder! Push him!

1:08:41.595 --> 1:08:43.554
No! No!

1:08:43.684 --> 1:08:45.251
Emily. Emily.

1:08:45.382 --> 1:08:46.905
<i>No!</i>

1:08:47.035 --> 1:08:49.560
<i>Emily, no. No, no.</i>

1:08:58.395 --> 1:08:59.787
Back here, guys.

1:08:59.918 --> 1:09:02.747
That's the bitch.
That's the piece of trash.

1:09:02.877 --> 1:09:04.270
Take it out.

1:09:07.839 --> 1:09:09.232
Open the door!

1:09:11.582 --> 1:09:14.933
<i>No!</i>

1:09:15.063 --> 1:09:18.110
Open the door.

1:09:20.808 --> 1:09:21.766
Emily!

1:09:21.896 --> 1:09:23.333
<i>Emily, use the--</i>

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:51.448
The mirror's in your pocket!
Use the mirror!

1:10:11.729 --> 1:10:13.252
Yes!

1:10:13.383 --> 1:10:15.298
Emily, you did it!
Emily, you did...

1:10:15.428 --> 1:10:17.387
you did it, you did it!

1:10:31.139 --> 1:10:32.793
<i>Emily!</i>

1:10:32.924 --> 1:10:34.708
<i>Emily, you did it!</i>

1:10:36.275 --> 1:10:37.972
Yes.

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:40.323
<i>Sam.</i>

1:10:44.196 --> 1:10:46.154
Give it up. Let's go!

1:10:46.285 --> 1:10:48.896
Hands up!
Let's see your hands!

1:10:50.550 --> 1:10:52.944
She's coming out.

1:10:53.074 --> 1:10:55.251
Keep those hands
where we can see 'em.

1:10:56.382 --> 1:10:58.254
Get ready to go.

1:12:16.723 --> 1:12:18.551
<i>Hey!</i>
Hey.

1:12:18.682 --> 1:12:20.379
<i>Oh, wait. Mom, Mom, say hi.</i>

1:12:20.510 --> 1:12:22.555
<i>It's Sam.
Hi, Sam.</i>

1:12:22.686 --> 1:12:24.383
Hi, Yuko.
<i>Can you please
get Emily</i>

1:12:24.514 --> 1:12:26.080
<i>to fold her clothes
a little faster</i>

1:12:26.211 --> 1:12:27.995
<i>so we don't miss our flight?</i>

1:12:28.126 --> 1:12:30.258
<i>I'm almost done.</i>

1:12:30.389 --> 1:12:32.217
<i>Anyway, what's up?</i>

1:12:32.348 --> 1:12:36.439
Um, so I wanted to tell you

1:12:36.569 --> 1:12:38.528
I'm gonna try
and go back to school.

1:12:38.658 --> 1:12:39.920
<i>Hell yes, Sam.</i>

1:12:40.051 --> 1:12:41.661
<i>That is what I'm talking about.
Yes!</i>

1:12:41.792 --> 1:12:44.969
Yeah, it's, um,
terrifying, but I'm...

1:12:45.099 --> 1:12:46.362
I'm excited.

1:12:46.492 --> 1:12:48.276
And I was just wondering, um,

1:12:48.407 --> 1:12:50.148
could I take you up
on your offer

1:12:50.278 --> 1:12:51.410
to help me with my application?

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:52.629
Look over my essay?

1:12:52.759 --> 1:12:53.717
<i>Oh, my God, of course.</i>

1:12:53.847 --> 1:12:55.458
<i>I would love to.</i>

1:12:55.588 --> 1:12:56.894
<i>Yeah, just send it to me
whenever you're ready.</i>

1:12:57.024 --> 1:12:58.417
Okay. I will.

1:12:58.548 --> 1:13:00.201
<i>Oh, I've been meaning
to ask you,</i>

1:13:00.332 --> 1:13:03.770
<i>who were you trying to call
last month, anyway?</i>

1:13:03.901 --> 1:13:06.947
I was just trying
to order a pizza, I think.

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:08.949
<i>Pizza? Really?</i>

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.997
<i>Wow. Love that a wrong
pizza number saved my life.</i>

1:13:13.127 --> 1:13:14.738
Me, too.

1:13:14.868 --> 1:13:16.740
<i>Oh, oh, Lyft is here.
Lyft is here.</i>

1:13:16.870 --> 1:13:18.916
<i>Okay, we got to go.</i>
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

1:13:19.046 --> 1:13:21.527
<i>Thank you. And hey, I am coming
to visit you after, okay?</i>

1:13:21.658 --> 1:13:23.224
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that.

1:13:23.355 --> 1:13:26.271
