WEBVTT

00:40.125 --> 00:41.125
Now the latest

00:41.500 --> 00:44.000
on the big Berlin blackout.
Official sources report

00:44.375 --> 00:47.291
that the two main suspects,
Lukas Franke and Lena Arandt...

00:47.666 --> 00:49.916
Turn off the TV.
- ...may be heading East.

00:50.291 --> 00:51.625
Please turn off the TV!

00:54.791 --> 00:56.833
Give me the remote control.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.791
Hope we're safe here.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.875
What now?
- We wait.

03:44.916 --> 03:45.958
We wait?

03:47.750 --> 03:49.583
We have no choice
but to wait here.

03:50.375 --> 03:51.500
I can't do that.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.958
You can't go out there now.
- No. I just can't...

03:56.708 --> 03:58.833
Fuck! Shit.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.250
Trust me!

04:05.500 --> 04:08.916
Why should I trust you
when I don't even know you? Huh?

04:10.541 --> 04:12.833
Why should I trust you? Huh?

04:20.666 --> 04:21.958
Huh?

04:23.583 --> 04:27.250
Case asked me four weeks ago if I
was interested in publishing something.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.791
He was onto something big.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.916
You're telling me this now?

04:42.958 --> 04:46.250
I... - Why didn't you
tell me this before?

04:47.625 --> 04:48.916
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

04:49.666 --> 04:53.791
I didn't know you before, so how
should I know if I could trust you?

05:03.041 --> 05:04.708
So what was it?

05:13.833 --> 05:17.666
A secret program of the NSA,
"Burning Man". He had information on it.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.291
That's all I know.

05:26.791 --> 05:28.375
It's all connected.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.083
What?

05:30.458 --> 05:34.958
1.8 times 10 to the tenth.
Sound familiar?

05:36.125 --> 05:37.125
No.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.250
Slomo told me I've got 72 hours
to find out what it means.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.666
Again,
1.8 times 10 to the tenth.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.500
What does it mean?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.791
I've got 72 hours
to save my family.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.375
I can't just stand here
and wait.

05:59.375 --> 06:03.708
Lukas. If you go out there now
and they get you, it's over.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.833
Franke
and Arandt are on the run.

06:09.208 --> 06:14.125
We know they're armed, and we're
dealing with alleged murderers.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.375
Now the search for these two
has absolute priority.

06:18.916 --> 06:20.708
We're increasing our staff.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.291
The District Attorney and the State
Prosecutor just confirmed, any means

06:24.666 --> 06:27.750
we use to capture them is legal.
Dilara, you lead the search.

06:36.458 --> 06:37.791
Sandra?

06:38.166 --> 06:40.208
Do you have a minute?

07:01.333 --> 07:03.416
You put Dilara on me?

07:04.166 --> 07:08.375
She's not exactly subtle.
- Info got to the press.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.875
Franke stops being observed.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.208
What should I think?
- You should read this.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.791
Jeryczek worked for KUP Security
Solutions as a pen-testing agent.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.041
Yeah, that's the company
responsible for our IT security.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.541
He hacked into
the account of our administrator

07:26.916 --> 07:29.791
and got full access
to our IT and email systems.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.000
Jeryczek got into
my email account

07:32.375 --> 07:35.708
and made sure Franke's
observation order was cancelled.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.875
Good work, Siebert.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.708
Is that an apology?

07:52.041 --> 07:54.375
You seriously think
I'd go behind your back?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.583
Anything less
would be unprofessional.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.291
Screw yourself!

08:20.500 --> 08:24.083
It's really awful
to just sit here and do nothing.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.625
My son would love this place.

08:36.375 --> 08:37.875
You got kids?

08:41.291 --> 08:42.958
I'm not the family type.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.916
It hurts to lose someone.

08:48.541 --> 08:50.875
I don't want to take the risk.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.583
It's worth the risk,

08:55.708 --> 08:57.125
believe me.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.708
"Then the tiniest mouse
came out of her hiding place

09:18.083 --> 09:19.666
and stood in front
of the other mice.

09:20.041 --> 09:23.250
She said, 'I will free Princess
Nibbletooth from Tom Cat's dungeon.'"

09:23.791 --> 09:26.208
This is a real boring story.

09:26.583 --> 09:30.875
I want the dinosaur book. - Your
dinosaur book is back home.

09:31.291 --> 09:33.458
I specifically asked you
what you wanted to bring.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.916
I wanna see Daddy.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.708
Wait.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.041
Hello?
- Hello, Hanna.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.875
I'll be right back.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.958
I've seen the news. How
can they say things like that?

10:00.208 --> 10:04.791
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
If there's anything I can do for you.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.333
That's nice of you. I have to
sort things out. - Hanna,

10:08.708 --> 10:11.708
did you know I was
pretty chubby as a teenager?

10:14.708 --> 10:17.291
I'm not talking cute chubby,

10:17.666 --> 10:19.916
I mean no-friends-at-all fat.

10:21.041 --> 10:25.750
Spending all day in my room
sad and alone, curtains closed.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.916
So I speak from experience.

10:29.708 --> 10:33.083
Stewing in your own juices
just makes things worse.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.083
I'd rather,
you not go through that.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.291
Ehm...

10:40.208 --> 10:43.291
What about a small
change of scenery tomorrow?

10:47.708 --> 10:49.916
Okay, ehm ...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.541
Sure. Why not?

11:28.791 --> 11:30.041
I gotta go.

11:31.083 --> 11:34.125
I can't wait
any longer. - Yeah.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.166
I'll come too.

11:53.708 --> 11:55.458
You take care.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.916
I'm sorry. Sorry.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.333
What are you doing here?
The police are after you. Fuck off!

13:20.708 --> 13:22.875
Listen, what does
1.8 times 10 to the tenth mean?

13:23.250 --> 13:25.166
If you end up leading
the police to me, I swear...

13:25.541 --> 13:28.958
Will you listen for a minute! Case
talked to Lena right before his death.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.333
He hacked a program called Burning Man.
He wanted to release the whole thing.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.958
Have you heard of Burning Man?
- Sorry, no.

13:35.333 --> 13:39.208
Look, I gotta know. 1.8 times
10 to the tenth. What could it be?

13:39.666 --> 13:41.625
It's not an access code.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.916
What do I know?

13:48.291 --> 13:52.166
He's gotta be referring to something.
Sounds like some serious mathematics.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.541
How are you two connected?

13:56.500 --> 14:00.083
I worked in a psychiatric clinic.
- What did you do with him there?

14:04.250 --> 14:06.500
Nothing, we played board games.

14:12.666 --> 14:16.166
Meaning of 1.8 times 10 to the tenth.

14:18.708 --> 14:19.750
What are you doing?

14:20.791 --> 14:23.333
Probability 1.8 times 10 to the tenth.

14:26.458 --> 14:30.500
Game variants 1.8 times 10 to the tenth.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.666
That's it!
- What?

14:33.041 --> 14:37.250
It refers to a game with
1.8 times 10 to the tenth variations.

14:40.791 --> 14:43.166
Morris!
- And?

14:43.625 --> 14:45.208
Who's that?

14:47.791 --> 14:49.541
The board game.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.458
Locked-ward psychiatry.

16:02.541 --> 16:06.166
People usually steal key cards
to get out of here. Not to get in.

16:07.291 --> 16:11.416
You've changed
quite a bit. - You haven't.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.958
You've been in the news lately.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.375
Don't believe a word of it.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.916
Lukas, I've been
here for over 30 years.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.791
I know if someone
is a psychopathic murderer or not.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.416
Why are you here?

16:32.791 --> 16:37.875
Is it Jens Kaufmann? I'm sorry,
but he's dead. - I know.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.875
Or maybe you want a job, Lukas?
I was hoping you'd come back.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.291
Inge,

16:44.666 --> 16:47.291
Jens got involved
in something he couldn't finish.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.083
Erm...

16:51.500 --> 16:54.625
You and Kaufmann
have always been a mystery.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.333
You know
I can't just let you in here.

17:09.666 --> 17:12.416
My break's over.
I have to get to work.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.000
Too bad the door
closes so slowly.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.666
The most beautiful day. Leon.

19:28.458 --> 19:32.666
As a child I always imagined
that every human being has his own note.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.833
Some notes are bright,
and some are dark.

19:36.458 --> 19:40.625
Not all of them are perfect,
but together they form a melody.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.833
And how does it sound?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.875
It depends.

19:48.041 --> 19:49.583
To me, the cosmos.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.500
I usually know what kind
of note someone is pretty quickly.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.791
Not so easy with you.

19:58.958 --> 20:01.958
I don't think I have a note.
- Nonsense!

20:06.375 --> 20:08.666
If I ever had one,

20:09.750 --> 20:11.750
I can't hear it right now.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.750
By the way,
do they have any leads yet?

20:20.583 --> 20:22.750
Do you believe
there's a hacker out there?

20:23.125 --> 20:25.750
I think my husband found him.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.500
If you need any help,

20:31.208 --> 20:33.041
I have contacts.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.250
Rollo!

21:55.000 --> 21:58.208
"Dear Christina, I'm sure you saw me
in the news, but please believe me,

21:58.583 --> 22:00.166
that none of it is true. I got hacked

22:00.541 --> 22:02.291
and I'm being threatened
The man that's after me

22:02.666 --> 22:06.208
is very dangerous. Please take Rollo
and leave the city at once.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.666
Get to safety! Lena."

22:13.166 --> 22:14.500
Rollo?

22:16.375 --> 22:17.583
Rollo?

22:40.041 --> 22:42.458
Emergency police service.
How can I help you?

23:05.833 --> 23:07.666
Who's that?

23:08.125 --> 23:10.708
Doesn't matter.
He'll be out of here soon anyway.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.291
It does matter who he is!

23:14.083 --> 23:15.958
Come with me.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.375
Tell me!

23:26.291 --> 23:27.375
So?

23:32.791 --> 23:34.416
He's my brother.

23:39.541 --> 23:41.083
Your brother?

23:43.041 --> 23:44.125
Why is he here?

23:59.833 --> 24:02.208
I always dreaded the days
when the curtains stayed closed.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.958
She couldn't get up and...

24:07.708 --> 24:09.875
she'd forget about us.

24:11.041 --> 24:15.583
Sometimes the door was unlocked and we
could get out and be free for a while.

24:17.625 --> 24:19.916
Then a neighbor realized one day

24:20.291 --> 24:22.875
something was
wrong with our family.

24:23.625 --> 24:26.375
No foster family
would take us together.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.458
But I always took care of him.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.125
I protected him then,

24:35.500 --> 24:37.250
and I will now.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.875
Protect him from what?

24:46.875 --> 24:49.416
What did you do? Tell me.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.333
He pressured me.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.333
He threatened to hurt him.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.083
Who did?

25:06.916 --> 25:08.458
Slomo.

25:16.416 --> 25:17.583
What did he want?

25:21.875 --> 25:23.416
He...

25:23.791 --> 25:25.833
wanted to know
what you're up to.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.458
How could you do that?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.083
I'm wanted for murder,
my wife won't talk to me,

25:37.458 --> 25:40.958
everyone thinks I'm crazy,
thanks to you!

25:43.041 --> 25:46.208
I had no other choice.
- Of course you did.

25:49.208 --> 25:52.541
You could've warned me.
You could've helped me.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.541
But you played your games
and talked about trust.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.708
And I believed you!

25:59.083 --> 26:01.083
I believed you!

26:04.250 --> 26:05.750
I'm sorry.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.541
Want some more?

27:17.333 --> 27:18.750
Is it good?

27:32.166 --> 27:34.791
Does Christina
know where you are?

27:39.625 --> 27:42.833
Okay, then finish
and I'll take you back to her.

28:04.333 --> 28:07.125
You and Christine are going
on a trip. Maybe you'll go to the ocean.

28:07.500 --> 28:11.333
We went to the ocean with Mom and Dad,
remember? You were still very little.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.250
Come on.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.416
Rollo!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.416
Police!
Come out with your hands up!

29:13.791 --> 29:16.541
I... will protect... you.
- Rollo!

29:17.375 --> 29:18.708
Over there!

30:54.625 --> 30:55.833
Hands up!

30:58.500 --> 30:59.875
Freeze!

31:04.666 --> 31:06.250
Put your hands on you back!

31:06.916 --> 31:09.208
Thomas? Leon is in danger.
Get Leon to safety.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.666
Face on the ground!

31:14.166 --> 31:15.833
Hands behind your back!

31:19.000 --> 31:21.458
Thomas,
get Hanna and Leon to safety!

31:22.166 --> 31:25.208
Thomas!
Get Hanna and Leon and hide!

31:26.833 --> 31:29.250
You have
the right to remain silent...

31:43.625 --> 31:46.250
Two. - Yeah.
- Extra lime, please.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.791
Two.

31:51.708 --> 31:54.458
Excuse me, another
two gin and tonics, please.

31:54.833 --> 31:56.750
Yeah, same as before.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.291
But mine could be actually
a bit weaker.

32:01.791 --> 32:04.416
Here you go.
- Thanks.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.000
Let's dance.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.500
I'm the worst dancer in the world.

32:11.875 --> 32:14.041
I promise,
you couldn't be worse than me.

32:14.416 --> 32:16.458
No, I really can't dance.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.875
How about we play a game?

32:22.083 --> 32:26.125
Whoever laughs first loses and
pays for the next round, okay?

32:26.625 --> 32:27.791
Okay.

32:49.416 --> 32:50.666
I think...

32:53.708 --> 32:56.250
I know how you sound.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.000
Do you?

33:40.583 --> 33:42.625
Seven missed calls?

33:43.500 --> 33:45.791
What's going on?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.291
I have to leave.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.541
Thank you. I'm sorry.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.375
No worries.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.250
Nothing happened.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.250
Where's Hanna?
- What do you want?

34:18.625 --> 34:21.250
I'm bringing them to safety.
- They're safe here. - Thomas?

34:21.625 --> 34:23.541
You must leave.
Leon's in danger.

34:23.916 --> 34:27.333
Who says that? - Lukas.
- What if he's imagining all this?

34:27.708 --> 34:29.458
The hacker needs Leon.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.791
Thomas,
Leon is in danger. The hacker needs him.

34:33.166 --> 34:36.208
Leon is the key!
- Face on the ground!

34:36.583 --> 34:40.250
Thomas! Get Hanna
and Leon to safety! Thomas!

34:40.625 --> 34:43.000
Get Hanna and Leon and hide!

34:44.875 --> 34:46.625
You still believe
I killed Frank Jeryczek?

34:48.541 --> 34:50.916
That's why I'm here, right?

34:51.625 --> 34:53.541
I don't believe it.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.125
I know it.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.625
You know the video with the gorilla?

35:03.291 --> 35:05.541
A toddler falls into a gorilla enclosure

35:05.916 --> 35:07.833
and the world talks about one thing.

35:08.208 --> 35:11.166
It shakes the toddler nearly to death.

35:12.625 --> 35:14.875
And then the gorilla gets killed.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.333
Why are you telling me this?

35:21.375 --> 35:25.375
The gorilla only shakes
the toddler to see if it's still alive.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.083
It takes it in its arms,
sits down at the gate

35:29.458 --> 35:33.208
and waits until the zookeeper comes
to take the injured kid.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.333
Have you ever thought...

35:38.708 --> 35:40.666
maybe I'm the gorilla?

35:43.166 --> 35:45.000
Sorry ...
- I'm in an interrogation!

35:45.375 --> 35:47.208
Sorry but
there's a gentleman here...

35:48.875 --> 35:51.791
Lorenz, BND.
We'll take over from here.

35:52.166 --> 35:55.583
What? - Nothing to worry about.
It'll only be an informal conversation.

35:55.958 --> 35:58.583
You don't have
any right to do this!

35:58.958 --> 36:01.291
Mr. Franke, please
follow me. And, Ms. Jansen?

36:01.666 --> 36:05.583
You'll need to answer a few questions.
- You don't have the authority.

36:06.875 --> 36:10.208
The Prime Minister's office
has a different opinion.

36:10.583 --> 36:12.500
Mr. Franke, please follow me.

36:18.625 --> 36:22.125
Do you dream?
- What's that?

36:22.500 --> 36:26.208
What do you want from me?
- To get inside your skull.

36:27.458 --> 36:30.041
I wanna
know everything you know.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.083
So this Case guy
was able to hack our agency?

36:36.333 --> 36:40.666
Your family ever deal
with a sniper? - Sniper!

36:41.458 --> 36:44.250
Isn't that
story a little absurd?

36:46.458 --> 36:49.333
I didn't
take it seriously at first,

36:49.708 --> 36:53.750
but after that email I went to
Case and... - He's a corpse.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.291
That's all?

37:00.416 --> 37:02.958
Yeah, that's all. Trust me.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.458
I don't buy it for a moment.

37:09.833 --> 37:13.791
I think your imagination was inspired
by your friend Case's conspiracies.

37:14.416 --> 37:18.000
There is no evidence whatsoever
that you got hacked in the first place.

37:18.375 --> 37:21.125
Your bullshit theories
are gonna make me sick!

37:21.500 --> 37:25.083
So you're suddenly the victim of
a great conspiracy, Mr. Franke?

37:25.458 --> 37:28.833
But if we got hacked,
we'll know soon enough.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.458
Hey, Wessling!

37:36.250 --> 37:37.500
Slomo!

37:37.916 --> 37:39.916
Son of a bitch!

37:42.458 --> 37:44.000
Help!

37:44.666 --> 37:46.041
Help me!

37:46.458 --> 37:47.333
Help!

37:55.458 --> 37:57.333
Are you okay, Marc?

37:58.541 --> 37:59.791
503!

38:00.166 --> 38:02.750
503. Get the 503!

38:03.583 --> 38:07.875
Tell me, Mr. Lorenz, exactly what
is Mr. Wessling's involvement here?

38:08.250 --> 38:10.791
You can stop your investigation.
You're off this case.

38:11.166 --> 38:15.708
How does Franke know about Burning Man?
- You ask too many questions. Go home.

39:08.458 --> 39:09.541
Hello.

39:21.958 --> 39:24.541
Hello.
- Number 503, please.

39:43.791 --> 39:46.541
Here. This is for you.

40:26.083 --> 40:27.916
I think he looks
more and more like Lukas.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.333
He misses him.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.500
We both miss him.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.875
What's going on?

40:55.375 --> 40:56.458
The doctor

40:56.833 --> 40:59.041
who allegedly treats Lukas

41:01.291 --> 41:03.208
doesn't have
a patient named Franke.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.458
Lukas was telling the truth.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
Have you talked to him?

41:23.875 --> 41:28.166
He's no longer at the police station
and I don't know where they took him.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.625
Daddy!
