09:35.825 --> 09:37.460
- MONEY TALKS, RIGHT?

09:37.493 --> 09:40.229
- ACTUALLY, MIKE,
THESE GUYS ARE LIKE FIELD MICE.

09:40.263 --> 09:42.165
THEY'RE CREATURES OF HABIT.

09:42.198 --> 09:43.499
THEY SPOT ONE LITTLE THING
OUT OF PATTERN,

09:43.533 --> 09:45.535
THEY'RE LIKELY TO RUN RIGHT BACK
INTO THEIR HIDEY-HOLE.

09:45.568 --> 09:47.136
- ALL RIGHT.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.738
WELL, IF OUR LADY IN WHITE HERE
DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPITAL,

09:48.771 --> 09:50.206
I KNOW YOU'RE OFF NARCO.

09:50.239 --> 09:52.475
WOULD YOU MIND
BEING HER SUGAR DADDY?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.644
- [sighs]

09:54.677 --> 09:58.314
WELL, WE'RE SETTING UP A DEAL,
NOT MAKING ONE, RIGHT?

09:58.347 --> 10:00.116
- YEAH.

10:00.149 --> 10:01.484
- I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BUY YOU SHINY, PRETTY THINGS.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.219
- [laughing]

10:03.252 --> 10:05.254
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BRIEF YOU
ON THE RIDE.

10:05.288 --> 10:07.523
BYE, MIKE.

10:14.497 --> 10:19.235
- [snoring]

10:19.268 --> 10:21.270
- DALE, WAKE UP.

10:23.439 --> 10:25.575
JAKES!

10:27.276 --> 10:29.512
[sighs]

10:29.545 --> 10:30.713
- [grunts]

10:30.746 --> 10:33.416
HUH? WHAT'S-- WHAT'S--
WHAT'S TODAY?

10:33.449 --> 10:35.685
AH! JESUS!

10:35.718 --> 10:37.820
- I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.263
- WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?
- OUTLIERS.

10:47.296 --> 10:50.499
SOMETHING THAT POINTS
TO A SPECIFIC BUS.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.669
- OUTLIERS.
- MM-HMM.

10:53.703 --> 10:56.505
- FANTASTIC.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.447
[indistinct chatter]

11:06.315 --> 11:08.117
[dog barks]

11:15.258 --> 11:17.727
[dogs barking]

11:17.760 --> 11:20.696
- LADY IN WHITE,
I MISSED YOU.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.098
- I MISSED YOU TOO, TOP.

11:22.131 --> 11:23.833
THIS IS MY FRIEND
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.769
- LIL TOP, WHAT'S UP, B?
MY NAME'S PAUL.

11:26.802 --> 11:28.571
- YOU BLACK?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.439
- [speaking Spanish]

11:30.473 --> 11:32.308
MY DAD WAS DARK-SKINNED,
MY MOM WAS LIGHT--

11:32.341 --> 11:33.509
BOTH HALVES OF THE D.R.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.278
- YOU'RE FROM THE DOMINICAN?

11:35.311 --> 11:37.079
- I WASN'T RAISED THERE,
BUT IN THE WINTERTIME,

11:37.113 --> 11:38.447
WE USED TO GO DOWN
TO BARAHONA.

11:38.481 --> 11:39.749
- HE'S GOOD, TOP.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.784
[whispering]
HE HAS GREEN.

11:44.053 --> 11:46.255
- ALL RIGHT.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.256
COME ON.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.325
- AFTER YOU.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.362
[reggae music playing]

11:53.396 --> 11:56.365
- OKAY, SO GET THIS.

11:56.399 --> 11:58.701
PAUL GETS THIS BUCK TICKET
AT THE GROCERY STORE--

11:58.734 --> 12:00.369
A PICK FIVE, RIGHT?
- PICK FIVE!

12:00.403 --> 12:02.605
- PICK FIVE,

12:02.638 --> 12:04.373
- MM. ALL FIVE.
- [laughs]

12:04.407 --> 12:05.775
- LUCKY GUY.
- YEAH, MAN.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.510
I WANNA RENT A HOUSE
UP IN THE HILLS,

12:07.543 --> 12:09.378
SPEND THE WEEKEND
SPRINKLING STARDUST

12:09.412 --> 12:10.780
ON BAD BITCHES IN BIKINIS.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.782
YOU KNOW?
- YOU'LL HAVE TO INVITE ME THEN.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.350
- YEAH, B.
- WHAT BARRIO?

12:14.383 --> 12:16.118
- IN THE HILLS?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.653
- IN BARAHONA.

12:17.687 --> 12:19.221
WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD?

12:19.255 --> 12:21.057
- OH, I WASN'T
IN THE CITY PROPER.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.825
- NO?
- NO, UP THE HIGHWAY A CLIP.

12:23.059 --> 12:25.761
LITTLE VILLAGE BY A LAKE.

12:25.795 --> 12:28.431
- LADY IN WHITE...

12:28.464 --> 12:31.200
YOU WANT A TASTE?
- NOT IF IT'S YOUR USUAL STUFF.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.668
- HOW MUCH
YOU LOOKING TO MOVE?

12:32.702 --> 12:35.237
- OH, THIS IS THE BEST PART.

12:35.271 --> 12:37.540
PAUL?
- JUST A LITTLE BIT.

12:37.573 --> 12:39.408
- 20 GRAND.

12:39.442 --> 12:40.609
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:40.643 --> 12:42.211
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

12:42.244 --> 12:43.546
- THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY
OTHER TIME YOU COME IN HERE,

12:43.579 --> 12:45.481
YOU BUY A GRAM,
AND TODAY YOU A HIGH ROLLER?

12:45.514 --> 12:47.516
- NO, I--IT'S NOT MY MONEY,
IT'S PAUL'S.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.251
I TOLD YOU HE JUST WON IT.
- I KNOW.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.387
THE PICK FIVE, THE PICK FIVE.
[speaking Spanish]

12:51.420 --> 12:54.557
- OKAY, WELL, IF IT STINKS,
WE CAN TAKE IT BACK, RIGHT?

12:54.590 --> 12:56.092
[screams]

12:56.125 --> 12:57.460
TOP!

12:57.493 --> 12:59.628
[crying]
- DON'T.

13:11.544 --> 13:13.642
- STOP. YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

13:13.642 --> 13:15.811
- OH, THE MISTAKE WAS HIS.
- [crying]

13:15.845 --> 13:17.313
- COMING IN HERE
WITH SOME BULLSH--

13:17.346 --> 13:19.081
[speaking Spanish]
ABOUT THE D.R.

13:19.115 --> 13:21.751
- WASN'T NO FAIRY TALE,
HERMANO, NEVER WAS.

13:21.784 --> 13:25.154
- NO?
- NO.

13:25.187 --> 13:28.691
- WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THE LAKE?

13:28.724 --> 13:30.726
- WHAT?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.628
- "LITTLE VILLAGE BY A LAKE,"
YOU SAID.

13:32.661 --> 13:35.498
AIN'T THAT MANY LAKES
ON THE ISLAND.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.535
- LAGO ENRIQUILLO.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.237
RIGHT UP HIGHWAY 46,
YOU KNOW IT?

13:41.270 --> 13:43.639
YOU GET THERE EARLY ENOUGH,
YOU CAN CATCH PAVON.

13:43.672 --> 13:46.375
LISTEN, LIL TOP,
THIS PICK FIVE--

13:46.409 --> 13:47.777
IT PAYS BIG.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.612
THERE'S A LOT MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.714
- [crying] A LOT MORE, TOP.
THERE IS A LOT MORE!

13:51.747 --> 13:55.351
- 20 Gs IS ALMOST A KEY.
I AIN'T GOT NO KEY.

13:55.384 --> 13:56.819
- CAN YOU GET ONE?

13:57.052 --> 14:00.256
- SUNDAY.

14:00.289 --> 14:02.258
- [screams]

14:02.291 --> 14:04.226
- I'MA HOLD ON TO THIS

14:04.260 --> 14:07.129
IN CASE YOU TWO RUN
INTO SOME UNSAVORY ELEMENT.

14:07.163 --> 14:10.166
COMPRENDE?
- COMPRENDO.

14:10.199 --> 14:11.700
- YEAH.

HOMEBOY'S GONNA FLIP!

14:19.842 --> 14:21.377

14:21.410 --> 14:22.778
CAN I ASK,
IF WARREN FINDS OUT--

14:22.812 --> 14:24.280
- HE'S NOT GONNA FIND OUT.
DON'T SAY THAT.

14:24.313 --> 14:25.614
- YEAH, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THE MAN DOESN'T SEEM

14:25.648 --> 14:27.116
LIKE
THE TAKE-IT-IN-STRIDE TYPE.

14:27.149 --> 14:28.417
- LOOK, WE'RE IN THE CONE
OF SILENCE HERE.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.819
HE AIN'T GONNA FIND OUT
UNLESS SOMEBODY TELLS HIM.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.687
- SOMEBODY TELLS WHO?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.789
- NO-- NOBODY.

14:35.191 --> 14:37.760
[exhales]

14:37.793 --> 14:39.195
- WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

14:39.228 --> 14:40.429
- HMM?

14:40.463 --> 14:44.099
- IT'S, UH,
BACKGAMMON, MAN.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.135
- JOHNNY.

14:46.168 --> 14:48.604
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.706
- [sighs]

14:50.739 --> 14:52.475
- MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING
IS MY FAULT.

14:52.508 --> 14:53.742
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU MORE.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.845
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS ENTIRE OPERATION

14:56.078 --> 14:57.446
IS A HOUSE OF CARDS.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.216
GUYS, WE HAVE TWO WEEKS, OKAY?
TWO WEEKS!

15:00.249 --> 15:01.383
- MM-HMM.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.518
- SO IF SOLANO EVEN CAUGHT
A SCENT OF THIS...

15:02.551 --> 15:04.487
- HE DIDN'T CATCH OF SCENT
OF THIS, MIKE!

15:04.520 --> 15:06.288
- JOHNNY'S BEEN DOING THIS
FOR WAY LONGER THAN YOU, MIKE.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.690
- PREACH!

15:07.723 --> 15:09.291
- THIS IS NOT A QUESTION
OF TENURE.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.193
THIS WAS DANGEROUS,
IRRESPONSIBLE,

15:11.227 --> 15:12.828
AND FRANKLY INSUBORDINATE.

15:13.062 --> 15:14.196
- OH!
- OH, OH!

15:14.230 --> 15:15.331
- INSUBORDINATE!

15:15.364 --> 15:16.398
I THINK WE HIT THE CORE ISSUE.
- REALLY?

15:16.432 --> 15:17.466
- IS THAT WHAT IT WAS?
- INSUBORDINATE.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.501
- DO I HAVE TO BREAK UP
ANOTHER FIGHT?

15:18.534 --> 15:19.602
- IT'S NOT A FIGHT.
- NOT YET.

15:19.635 --> 15:20.736
- HEY, BY THE WAY,

15:20.769 --> 15:22.204
YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS
NO PLAY ON SOLANO.

15:22.238 --> 15:23.305
- I DON'T--

15:23.339 --> 15:24.507
- THE PLAY CAME
AFTER SHE LEFT, MAN.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.841
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

15:26.075 --> 15:27.743
- I FOUND OUT CARLITO IS
INTO ANTIQUE MEXICAN WEAPONS.

15:27.776 --> 15:30.112
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO ACT
IN SUPPORT OF YOU,

15:30.145 --> 15:31.313
BUT INSTEAD, HE WENT IN--

15:31.347 --> 15:32.815
- MIKE, AT SOME POINT,
YOU HAVE TO STOP ACTING

15:32.848 --> 15:34.483
LIKE YOU INVENTED UNDERCOVER.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.584
- THANK YOU!
- SERIOUSLY.

15:35.618 --> 15:36.719
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS--

15:36.752 --> 15:38.120
- EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY.

15:38.153 --> 15:40.055
- CARLITO SOLANO
DOESN'T JUST MURDER PEOPLE,

15:40.089 --> 15:41.590
HE EVISCERATES THEM.
- WE KNOW THAT, MIKE.

15:41.624 --> 15:43.158
- AND THEN HE STRINGS THEM UP
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.593
- WE KNOW THAT!

15:44.627 --> 15:46.362
- THIS GUY'S NOT ONE OF YOUR
MALAYSIAN STREET TOUGHS, JOHN.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.597
- OH, IS HE NOT?
- HE'S A GRADE-A PSYCHOPATH.

15:48.631 --> 15:50.466
SO SERIOUSLY,
UNLESS YOU WANNA SEE

15:50.499 --> 15:52.334
WHAT THE INSIDE OF THAT PRETTY
LITTLE STOMACH LOOKS LIKE--

15:52.368 --> 15:53.736
- OKAY, MIKE,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:53.769 --> 15:55.204
DID I MAKE CONTACT?
- MM-HMM.

15:55.237 --> 15:56.772
- DID I SET THE MEET?
- YES.

15:56.805 --> 15:57.806
- DID I GET THE PISTOLS
ALL READY?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.775
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
- JOHNNY...

15:59.808 --> 16:02.111
CARLITO'S INTO MEXICAN SH--.

16:02.144 --> 16:03.345
- YEAH, HE IS.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.647
- CERTIFICATE
OF AUTHENTICITY.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.650
LES PISTOLETS SONT FRANCAIS.

16:07.683 --> 16:10.519
- THEY'RE FRENCH?

16:10.553 --> 16:11.587
- YEAH.

16:11.620 --> 16:14.490
- OH, GOD DAMN IT,
MY BOY SCREWED ME.

16:14.523 --> 16:16.158
- HEY, WHATEVER.
LOOK, MAN.

16:16.191 --> 16:17.760
HE'S A BANGER, HE'S NOT GONNA
WANNA SEE THE CERTIFICATE.

16:17.793 --> 16:20.396
LOOK, I'M-- IT'S GOOD.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:20.429 --> 16:24.600
- [scoffs]
- YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, MAN.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.236
- DID YOU FIGURE OUT
YOUR PERSONNEL ISSUE?

16:27.269 --> 16:29.104
- I DON'T KNOW.
[sighs]

16:29.138 --> 16:31.340
ZELANSKI'S RECALCITRANT,
BUT JAKES...

16:31.373 --> 16:32.675
[sighs]

16:32.708 --> 16:35.277
YOU THINK ICE WOULD PUSH BACK
IF I KICK HIM OUT?

16:35.311 --> 16:38.280
- THEY'LL DO THEIR OBLIGATORY
JURISDICTIONAL DICK SWINGING,

16:38.314 --> 16:41.817
BUT LET'S BE HONEST,
THAT'S ICE.

16:41.850 --> 16:42.785
- ANY ADVICE?

16:42.818 --> 16:44.520
- YEAH. DON'T SCREW UP.

16:44.553 --> 16:45.654
- TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU.

16:45.688 --> 16:49.491
[knocking]
- DUDE, I FIGURED IT OUT.

16:49.525 --> 16:53.162
JOSEPH NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
- NAPOLEON?

16:53.195 --> 16:55.397
- NO, NO.
NAPOLEON'S COUSIN.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.665
- I'M ON THE PHONE.

16:56.699 --> 16:59.668
- YEAH, BUT I FIGURED IT OUT.
- JOHNNY, PLEASE.

16:59.702 --> 17:03.439
I'M ON THE PHONE.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.108
- WHAT WAS THAT?

17:06.141 --> 17:07.409
- I HAVE MADE
A PERSONNEL CHANGE.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.678
I THINK THAT JOHNNY...

17:09.712 --> 17:11.714
TUTURRO...

17:11.747 --> 17:13.449
IS BETTER
FOR THE CARLITO SOLANO ANGLE.

17:13.482 --> 17:15.117
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE

17:15.150 --> 17:16.752
WHEN IT CAME TO TUTURRO.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.387
- I'M COMING AROUND.

17:18.420 --> 17:22.157
[knocking]
JOHNNY, I'M ON THE PHONE!

17:25.794 --> 17:28.197
I NEED TO LET YOU GO.
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:28.230 --> 17:30.299
- NO. I GOTTA GO.

17:32.334 --> 17:33.702
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:33.736 --> 17:37.106
- RELATIVE TO WHAT?

17:37.139 --> 17:39.575
- JESUS.

17:39.608 --> 17:40.576
- IT STILL HAS MOBILITY.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.177
IT'LL BE FINE.
IT JUST HURTS.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.312
- WHAT HAPPENED?

17:43.345 --> 17:45.581
- WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST.

17:45.614 --> 17:47.850
THERE'S NO HURRY-UP OFFENSE
IN UNDERCOVER WORK.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.218
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:49.251 --> 17:50.653
WASHINGTON IS
A RESULTS-ORIENTED PLACE,

17:50.686 --> 17:52.154
AND WITH THIS MONEY
THAT THEY'RE PUMPING IN--

17:52.187 --> 17:53.756
- THE SHIPMENT
COMES IN SUNDAY.

17:53.789 --> 17:55.424
- WAIT, YOU GOT IT?

17:55.457 --> 17:57.192
- I GOT IT.

17:57.226 --> 17:58.360
- YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.229
- [laughing]

18:00.262 --> 18:01.530
- SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY.

18:01.563 --> 18:03.065
OKAY, IF LIL TOP
GETS THIS THING SUNDAY,

18:03.098 --> 18:04.466
THAT MEANS THE BUSES
ARE GONNA COME ANYTIME.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.701
I NEED TO CHECK WITH JAKES AND--
- MIKE?

18:05.734 --> 18:06.769
- YEAH.
- MIKE?
