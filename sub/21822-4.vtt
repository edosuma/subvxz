WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:04.320
[Toast] But you promised me, Jane.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.880
You said I would definitely get the role.
You said I was an absolute shoo-in.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.200
I know, Toast.
That's what they said to me, too,

00:10.280 --> 00:14.680
and then Bruce Willis expresses an
interest and it's a whole new ballgame.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.040
Well, this is very embarrassing for me.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.120
Having to go around looking like a tit!

00:20.200 --> 00:21.480
Can't you sue them or something?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.200
Unfortunately not,
because there was nothing in writing,

00:24.280 --> 00:27.640
but I'm gonna make
one very angry phone call!

00:27.720 --> 00:29.720
I mean, I won't be able to go out
for six months!

00:29.800 --> 00:33.040
No, that is defeatism, Toast.
You can still do voiceovers.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
[sighs]

00:34.200 --> 00:36.200
In fact, I have you down for one
this afternoon.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.120
Oh, those fuckers are gonna love this.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.400
Nice outwear, dude.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.120
-You what?
-Cool jacket, Steven.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.080
Haven't seen one like that
in a long while.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.960
-What is that, vintage?
-No, it isn't bloody vintage.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.880
-I got it from Cliftons in St James's.
-Fancy.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.200
It is fancy.
You won't find one of these in Oxfam

00:57.280 --> 00:59.760
or wherever it is
you pick up those clown outfits from.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.800
-Cool.
-[Toast] Yeah.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.560
Alright, let's get on. What are we doing?

01:02.640 --> 01:05.560
Medical doc, operation blow by blow.
It's pretty squeamish stuff.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.800
Squeamish? Poppycock!

01:06.880 --> 01:09.000
They've just sent through the footage.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.480
[inhales sharply]
Oh Jesus! That's not nice!

01:11.560 --> 01:14.120
It's nothing I won't have seen before.
Let's just get on.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.960
Hi, Steven. This is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

01:17.040 --> 01:21.240
-Come on then, Plato, enlighten me.
-The footage is quite full on.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.240
If you'd rather record it wild,
without picture, it's totally do-able.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.120
-Yeah.
-No! I'll do it to picture. Run the tape.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.320
OK, comin' at you, big guy.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.920
Head injuries are possibly
the most critical and serious injury

01:35.000 --> 01:37.840
a qualified surgeon
will ever have to attend to.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.720
A specially designed tool,
not unlike a workman's masonry drill,

01:46.800 --> 01:50.800
is lowered onto the mark,
ready to cut through the skull.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.640
Oh!

01:55.720 --> 01:59.080
[exhales and sniffs]

01:59.160 --> 02:01.280
The brain is now visible.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.200
[vomits]

02:05.280 --> 02:07.000
[Danny] Is everything alright, Steven?

02:07.080 --> 02:09.280
Hope you haven't got sick
all over your nice new coat.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.320
[Clem laughs]

02:38.560 --> 02:41.440
The wind machine was going at full tilt.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.280
Everyone else had been blown off the
bloody deck, but I held my ground, Toast,

02:45.360 --> 02:47.600
and I delivered my speech in one take.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.040
[laughs] I have to hand it to you, Axel,

02:50.120 --> 02:53.240
I don't think
there's a finer actor in the country

02:53.320 --> 02:55.160
when it comes to performing in high winds.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.280
Well, when playing ships' captains
and mad kings,

02:58.360 --> 03:02.400
performing in gales and storms
comes very much with the territory.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.120
Wind machines, rain machines,

03:04.200 --> 03:06.520
thunder and lightning machines,
sleet machines--

03:06.600 --> 03:09.360
Tell me something,
when you're performing in high winds,

03:09.440 --> 03:11.560
are you tethered to a mast in some way?

03:11.640 --> 03:15.400
No, no, no.
The public would notice that immediately.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.280
It's all to do with technique.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.360
I look full on, but I usually stand
at a very, very slight angle.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.280
-Well, even Olivier used a safety harness.
-Yes.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.520
Nice fellow.
Used to be in the same lodge.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.280
I must invite you to a meeting.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.000
I'm guessing you're, uh,
on the square?

03:34.080 --> 03:35.320
What square?

03:35.400 --> 03:38.600
I wouldn't work with an actor
who wasn't in the Masons.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.400
Oh, the Masons! Oh, yes.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.480
Yes, of course. Uh...

03:43.560 --> 03:45.640
So, what's this production
that you're working on?

03:45.720 --> 03:48.440
TV adaptation of that
Master and Commander  film.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.040
-[inhales] Nice!
-Hm.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.080
They're promising me
an absolute howling gale.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.160
[laughs]

03:54.240 --> 03:57.760
You know, Toast,
I've heard it said that you, after me,

03:57.840 --> 04:00.320
are the best high winds actor in Britain.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.640
[laughs] I mean, I'm good,
but I don't think I'm in your league.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.720
True, but if anything should happen to me,

04:06.800 --> 04:09.600
you might find yourself
getting a few more job offers.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.280
[laughs] No, I think your position will be
quite secure for some years to come.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.960
Cheers.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.480
I was just talking to Axel Jacklin
in The Colonial Club.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.840
-Apparently he's a Mason.
-I see.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.640
You're not, uh, on the square, are you?

04:33.720 --> 04:34.840
Well, yes. Most actors are.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.760
Well, I'm not.
I always found it quite ridiculous.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.680
With the silly handshakes and pulling up
your trouser leg to the judge.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
Don't knock it, Toast.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.880
Many men have escaped
from a perilous situation

04:44.960 --> 04:47.040
by performing just such a ritual.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.280
I remember once I played a Bond girl
when I was in  Octopussy.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.760
You played a Bond girl?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.600
Yes, at tennis.
During a break at Pinewood.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.200
Maude Adams.
She wanted to play the full three sets.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.720
Cubby Broccoli came over and said,
"No, you only have to play one."

05:01.800 --> 05:03.320
He knew I was a Mason, you see.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.320
We performed the ritual
and I had the rest of the afternoon off.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.080
What the hell are you talking about?

05:08.160 --> 05:09.440
Mind if I watch the midday news?

05:09.520 --> 05:12.880
[newsreader]  Axel Jacklin was well known
for his many roles in costume dramas.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.040
-No!
-His agent, Jane Plough

05:15.120 --> 05:17.640
-said it was a terrible tragedy.
-It's a terrible...

05:17.720 --> 05:21.680
...tragedy,
but it's common knowledge that after Axel,

05:21.760 --> 05:25.560
you are the best high winds actor
in Britain.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.200
So, I've been onto
the  Master and Commander  chaps

05:28.280 --> 05:32.960
and I've persuaded them that you
are the best actor to take over the role.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.440
Well, you've certainly moved fast, Jane.
Axel's only been dead 46 minutes.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.000
There's no room for sentiment
in this game, Toast.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.360
And another thing,
I presume you're in the Masons.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.680
Well, you'd better join up if you're not,
because the producer, Parker Pipe,

05:46.760 --> 05:49.560
is very keen on using only Masonic actors.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.960
What's up, Toast? Sad about Axel?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.200
-Mm, yeah.
-Mm, yes.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.680
People die all the time though,
don't they?

05:59.360 --> 06:02.680
Actors, prime ministers, kings, queens.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.720
Everybody's just passing through.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.000
The list of people who've died
is as long as my arms.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.000
And I have unnaturally long arms.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.280
Imagine if all the actors who were dead
were alive.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.480
There'd be no jobs
for the younger actors at all.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.920
[distorted voice] Are you all right?
Jane?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.040
[distorted noises]

06:28.120 --> 06:31.320
[distorted noises]

06:32.760 --> 06:36.520
No. We have to strike
while the iron is hot.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.200
Stay where you are, Toast.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.480
Are you all right, Jane?
You're behaving very, very queerly.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.240
[whispers] Just stay where you are.
The bats are back.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.320
Let me get my special swat.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.520
[Toast whispers] What special swat?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.720
[yells]

06:56.800 --> 06:58.760
-[psychedelic music]
-Bloody bats!

06:58.840 --> 07:00.560
-I'll get help...
-I hate you!

07:00.640 --> 07:03.120
Bloody bats! I hate bats!

07:04.760 --> 07:06.200
[yells]

07:06.280 --> 07:09.200
-[music stops abruptly]
-[pants]

07:11.560 --> 07:14.640
-[intercom buzzer]
-Hello, this is Esther Rantzen.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.520
May I order a takeaway?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.760
-Toast.
-Davison.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.480
Have you been to see Jane?

07:23.560 --> 07:26.200
What the hell is going on up there?
Should I get a doctor?

07:26.280 --> 07:29.920
-Was it... the bats?
-She did mention bats.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.480
-I thought so. I'd better get go up.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. It is a bit alarming.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
The truth is, Toast, she's um...

07:36.640 --> 07:40.680
-back on the acid.
-Ah. Well, that would explain it.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.760
She was definitely having
some kind of bad bat trip.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.320
-How long's she been back on the acid?
-A week. Her timing is appalling.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.120
You know there's a surprise party for her
at The Colonial tomorrow?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.320
Celebrating 40 years as an agent.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.680
Jane really needs her friends now.
We all have to rally round.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.720
Sorry, Davison,
I need to ask you something.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.960
What?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.760
Are you a Mason?

08:03.840 --> 08:07.600
-[laughs] Of course, yes.
-Yes.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.880
[glass shatters]

08:09.960 --> 08:11.120
[distorted] Jane?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.440
[psychedelic music]

08:12.520 --> 08:15.640
-[Davison] Jane! Jane! Jane!
-[Jane screams] Bats!

08:16.560 --> 08:18.400
Steven.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.800
I'm Parker Pipe, the producer.
Nice to meet you.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.280
-This is Chloe Hammerslag, my assistant.
-[Toast] Hello.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.400
You knew Axel?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.720
Very well indeed. Old friends.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.080
It's such a tragedy.
His very first day on set.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.120
Yeah. He was just blown away, I believe.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.559
Yes, yes. His luck finally ran out.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.320
Lost his footing and just blown away.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.760
Hit the back wall of the set
at 70 miles an hour. [shudders]

08:43.840 --> 08:45.680
He told me he never wore a harness.

08:45.760 --> 08:50.160
[sobs] He never did.
Put authenticity above everything.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.360
But the show must go on, as they say.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.640
And Jane thoroughly recommended you.
How is Jane?

08:56.720 --> 08:59.160
-She's back on the acid.
-Oh, dear.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.520
Anyway, I've got a script here.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.720
By the way, Toast.
I presume you are um...

09:04.800 --> 09:09.520
Oh, uh... Oh, yes.
Fully paid up and committed member.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
OK.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.600
-Thanks, Camilla.
-[sighs]

09:13.680 --> 09:15.200
Parker...

09:16.480 --> 09:17.480
Toast.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.640
Ray bloody Purchase.
What are you doing here?

09:19.720 --> 09:21.120
Do you two know each other?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.040
[Ray and Toast growl]

09:23.120 --> 09:25.120
We thought you could
play the scene together,

09:25.200 --> 09:26.680
-if that's OK?
-[mutters] God.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.560
I didn't know you were up for this.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.240
I didn't know you were up for this either.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.840
-You're not a Mason.
-Yes, I am.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.080
-Oh, yes, he is.
-What?

09:34.160 --> 09:37.880
[Parker] Uh, there's one thing
we'd just like to try out.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.600
Chloe, could you...? [clears throat]

09:40.680 --> 09:44.640
Steven, Ray, would you mind standing
in front of the machine?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.120
-Of course.
-Alright, if I must.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.040
That would be great.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.120
Uh, I don't need a script, Parker,
I've learnt it.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
[scoffs]

09:54.280 --> 09:56.520
We're going to start on a three setting

09:56.600 --> 10:01.000
and then gradually bring it up to...
oh... ten.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.960
In your own time!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.680
[Toast] "Three days out of port, Captain.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.240
When do you think
the Frenchies will show themselves?"

10:12.320 --> 10:14.280
"Soon enough, Chief Surgeon.

10:14.360 --> 10:19.400
But fear not.
The wind may blow and storms may rage.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.040
England will never fail."

10:21.840 --> 10:23.280
"Aye aye, Captain.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.560
-Though it is a stiff south westerly."
-[wind machine gets louder]

10:26.640 --> 10:30.320
"Our destiny is
to see us through the battle."

10:30.400 --> 10:32.840
-[wind machine gets louder]
-"Sweet victory shall be..."

10:32.920 --> 10:36.120
-[wind machine gets louder]
-"Shall be..."

10:36.200 --> 10:37.560
[screams]

10:37.640 --> 10:40.440
OK, OK. Turn off the wind, Chloe.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.040
Steven, you stood on your feet.
That's fantastic.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.440
I'm so impressed,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.400
I think I'm gonna promote you
to the lead role of the captain now...

10:49.480 --> 10:51.840
-[Ray groans]
-...and demote Ray to chief surgeon.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.120
Well, that'd be great!

10:53.200 --> 10:58.000
Ray Purchase is a top class high winds
actor, but you are even better.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.440
The wind machine was up to nine!

11:00.520 --> 11:02.840
I mean, to manage nine at your first read,

11:02.920 --> 11:05.520
well, it's just super.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.360
Well, I was stood at a slight angle.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.680
It's a tip from Axel Jacklin.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.720
Yes, poor, poor Axel.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.200
[sobs]

11:23.920 --> 11:26.480
Ed, I need to become a Mason, immediately.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.680
Can you pull some strings?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.640
-Who are you trying to impress?
-Parker Pipe.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.200
-The producer?
-The very same.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.880
Oh, he's very high up. Partakes in
some of the more exotic Masonic rituals.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.880
I couldn't give rat shit.
Could you get me in?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.840
I think I know someone
who may be able to help you.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.760
-Really? Who?
-The thing is, he's an East Ender.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
You'll have to travel into
the East End to meet him.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.040
Who is the cockney cheap-jack?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.520
Fellow by the name of Basil Jet.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.560
I've got his number and address.
He may be able to fast track you.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.760
-Fabulous.
-It'll cost you.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.040
How much?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.600
-Twenty-seven pounds, 50 pence.
-Well, that's not too bad.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.240
For goodness' sake,
keep my name out of it.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.840
Alright, Ed.

11:59.920 --> 12:06.840
The East End, you say.
I wonder what it's like these days.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.880
-[baby cries]
-[Toast] Thanks, cabbie. Keep the change.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.720

-[woman] Psst!

12:20.600 --> 12:23.880
Follow me, love.
I can suck the Thames dry.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
Is that you, Mrs. Purchase?

12:26.040 --> 12:28.200
Toast, what are you doing here?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.680
You in the East End.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.360
I'm looking for a chap called Basil Jet.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.160
That's his shop two doors down.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.320
I must say,
you're full of surprises Mrs. Purchase.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.320
[whispers] Shh, stop saying my name.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.960
Oh yes, of course.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.160
Officer.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.640
[buzzer]

12:47.720 --> 12:50.280
[man slurs] Who is it?
What do you want?

12:50.360 --> 12:53.320
My name's Toast.
I want to be a Mason, today.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.360
-[dog barks]
-[gasps]

12:55.440 --> 12:57.160
You can't become a Mason just like that.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.040
Ed Howzer-Black said I could join.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.080
Oh right, yeah. You got the money?

13:01.160 --> 13:04.080
Yes. Twenty-seven pounds and 50 pence.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.120
I'm a little bit busy today
to do the paperwork.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.560
So you'll have to use the app.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.880
An app? What, there's an app you can use
to join the Masons?

13:10.960 --> 13:13.200
Wow! What's an app?

13:13.280 --> 13:14.440
You ask Ed. He'll tell ya.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.760
You download the app
and I'll text ya the password.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
When do I get initiated?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.160
I'll let you know all about it.
We'll have a ceremony.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.760
Bit of a booze-up, finger food.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.800
And you sir, you get a goody bag.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.680
-Yeah.
-Ooh. Great.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.800

13:28.880 --> 13:30.840
-[intercom buzzer]
-I say, what's a goody bag?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.600
Where is she?

13:36.680 --> 13:38.800
[voice whispers]  Ray!

13:40.560 --> 13:42.440
Oh, God. Not you again?

13:42.520 --> 13:46.360
Yes, it's me, Toast,
Ray fucking Purchase, again.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.800
What the hell were you talking about
at that audition? You're not a Mason.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.040
-Yes, I am.
-[groans]

13:52.120 --> 13:55.800
Jane should be here by now.
I'll try and track her down.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.000
-Yeah. Who else is here?
-Fotheringham's here.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.840
Last time I saw him,
he was being carted off to the BBC jail.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.280
Yeah, they let him out today.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.400
A lot of his types have been released
from the BBC jail

14:04.480 --> 14:06.600
in return for a reduction
in the license fee.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.880
Whoa.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.200
-Fotheringham.
-[grumbles]

14:13.280 --> 14:15.120
Didn't realize it was fancy dress.

we're having a surprise party for Jane

14:24.600 --> 14:26.360
at The Colonial Club.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.040
No, you are Jane.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.840
-What?
-We're here at The Colonial Club waiting.

14:30.920 --> 14:35.120
-Right?
-Yeah, well, get here as fast as you can!

14:35.200 --> 14:36.200

-Oh, fuck off!

14:39.480 --> 14:41.680
[psychedelic music]

14:48.960 --> 14:52.440
...and I said, "What the hell is wrong?
Have I forgotten our wedding anniversary?"

14:52.520 --> 14:55.280
And she said,
"No, we're not actually married."

14:55.360 --> 14:56.680
[all laugh]

14:56.760 --> 14:58.160
What are you doing here, Blair?

14:58.240 --> 15:01.080
-How do you know each other?
-Oh, we know each other.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.440
[voice whispers]  Mason.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.800
-Oh!
-Shh!

Get everyone's attention, Toast.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.480
-She'll say a few words.
-Yeah.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.600
What's going on here?

15:34.680 --> 15:37.160
Just say a few words to welcome everybody.

Forty years in the business
and it doesn't seem a day too long.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.600
When Ray Purchase told me there was
gonna be a surprise party for me,

16:13.400 --> 16:17.360
-I was of course very, very thrilled.
-[Fotheringham growls]

16:17.440 --> 16:21.960
So everybody just have
a wonderful, wonderful time.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.240
-Hear, hear!
-To Jane!

Oh, how lovely! From Torville and Dean.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.920
Sorry if I've been
a bit out of it recently, Toast.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.320
Thank you for visiting me.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.400
I do hope you can stay for a while.
I'm a bit lonely here.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.040
[phone rings]

16:49.120 --> 16:50.560
Toast.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.640
Ah, very well.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.920
It's Parker Pipe. I've gotta go.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.920
Oh, don't leave me. You've just arrived!

17:01.200 --> 17:05.280
I get so lonely here
at the Mayfair House of Addiction.

17:05.359 --> 17:09.000
-[grunting and gasping]
-Parker?

17:09.079 --> 17:13.839
Toast! So you've officially got the job.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.880
Welcome onboard, Captain.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.200
This Freemasons lark is the bees knees.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.960
I thought we'd celebrate
with an impromptu orgy.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.119
I'll have a slice of this!

17:25.200 --> 17:29.000
-[phone rings]
-Oh, you fuck...

17:29.080 --> 17:33.000
Basil Jet.... Is it now?

17:33.080 --> 17:36.920
[groans] Alright!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.760
I've gotta go, Pipe.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.680
Oh, well, what a shame.
Never mind. I'll see you on the set.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.880
[laughs] You betcha. Ooh...

-Is everything prepared for Junior Deacon?
-Aye, Grand Master.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.320
Will the head of ceremony please
place the under-brother unto the line?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.840
[voice whispers]  Shh! Mason.

18:22.920 --> 18:27.360
Remove his hood and step aside,

-You've got to be fucking kidding!

18:31.400 --> 18:34.120
Toast!
What the hell are you doing here?

18:34.200 --> 18:37.080
Are you under-brother Steven Toast?

18:37.160 --> 18:40.400
-I am.
-Is this your doing, Ed?

18:40.480 --> 18:43.560
Well, he seemed very keen.
And he did pay his £27.50.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.320
[Peter] I'm sure he did,
but come, on old chap--

starting from... now.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.280
There's a magnet.

Um... an onion?

19:08.720 --> 19:12.440
Um, framed photograph
of Dan and Peter Snow.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
Very well.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.480
The secret initiation ceremony
shall now commence.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.240
[animal squeals]

19:26.320 --> 19:28.960
[Fotheringham] I would slit my own throat,

I am nothing but a fool and a beggar.
