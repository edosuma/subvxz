00:01.667 --> 00:05.625
<i>Captain's log,</i>

00:01.667 --> 00:05.625
<i>stardate 41249.3.</i>

00:05.625 --> 00:08.083
<i>We have orbited</i>

00:05.625 --> 00:08.083
<i>the two major planets</i>

00:08.083 --> 00:09.875
<i>of the Beta Renner system,</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:12.291
<i>taking aboard delegates</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:12.291
<i>from those two worlds.</i>

00:12.291 --> 00:14.208
<i>Since achieving space flight</i>

00:14.208 --> 00:16.000
<i>their major life-forms--</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
<i>the Anticans and the Selay--</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
<i>have become deadly enemies,</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:22.875
<i>but both have also applied for</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:22.875
<i>admission into our Federation.</i>

00:22.875 --> 00:24.750
<i>We are to deliver</i>

00:22.875 --> 00:24.750
<i>these delegates</i>

00:24.750 --> 00:26.917
<i>to this sector's neutral</i>

00:24.750 --> 00:26.917
<i>conference planet--</i>

00:26.917 --> 00:28.417
<i>called Parliament--</i>

00:28.417 --> 00:31.458
<i>in the hope their dispute</i>

00:28.417 --> 00:31.458
<i>can be resolved.</i>

00:35.625 --> 00:39.417
I'm Captain Picard.

00:35.625 --> 00:39.417
Welcome aboard.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.917
We hope your journey

00:40.917 --> 00:42.625
will be pleasant

00:40.917 --> 00:42.625
and comfortable.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.792
Arranging that will be my

00:42.625 --> 00:45.792
first officer, Commander Riker.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.458
Welcome aboard.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.875
If you'll follow me, I will

00:47.458 --> 00:49.875
show you the accommodations...

00:49.875 --> 00:51.959
We can already smell

00:49.875 --> 00:51.959
the Anticans.

00:51.959 --> 00:54.041
They were taken

00:51.959 --> 00:54.041
aboard first?

00:54.041 --> 00:56.625
Only because their world

00:56.625 --> 00:58.417
was first on this heading

00:56.625 --> 00:58.417
to Parliament.

00:58.417 --> 01:01.375
Will our quarters

00:58.417 --> 01:01.375
be near the Anticans?

01:01.375 --> 01:03.333
About 100 meters apart.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.250
Is that all right?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.709
No.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.709
Unsatisfactory.

01:07.709 --> 01:10.375
I believe we can

01:07.709 --> 01:10.375
accommodate your wishes.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.417
We'll rearrange

01:10.375 --> 01:12.417
the suite assignments.

01:12.417 --> 01:13.709
If you'll follow me.

01:13.709 --> 01:16.458
And we must be upwind

01:13.709 --> 01:16.458
from the Anticans.

01:16.458 --> 01:19.041
Of course, sir.

01:32.792 --> 01:36.166
Neither seem like very promising

01:32.792 --> 01:36.166
Federation candidates, sir.

01:36.166 --> 01:37.667
Even Parliament's

01:36.166 --> 01:37.667
peacemakers

01:37.667 --> 01:40.083
may find this case

01:37.667 --> 01:40.083
a little difficult.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.834
But do you understand

01:50.041 --> 01:51.834
the basis

01:51.834 --> 01:53.417
of all this nonsense

01:51.834 --> 01:53.417
between them?

01:53.417 --> 01:56.000
No, sir. I never understood

01:53.417 --> 01:56.000
that sort of hostility

01:56.000 --> 01:57.333
even when I studied

01:56.000 --> 01:57.333
Earth history.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.834
Really? Oh, yes.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.333
Well, these life-forms

01:58.834 --> 02:01.333
feel such passionate hatred

02:01.333 --> 02:04.250
over matters of custom,

02:01.333 --> 02:04.250
god concepts...

02:04.250 --> 02:07.709
even, strangely enough,

02:04.250 --> 02:07.709
economic systems.

02:07.709 --> 02:09.208
Sir, my sensors

02:07.709 --> 02:09.208
are picking up

02:09.208 --> 02:11.083
an unusual

02:09.208 --> 02:11.083
energy object ahead.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.750
On screen.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.583
Confirmed, sir.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.083
My sensors read nothing solid,

02:18.583 --> 02:21.083
but considerable energy

02:21.083 --> 02:22.375
in changing patterns.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.709
Also traveling

02:22.375 --> 02:24.709
at warp speed, sir.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.375
Intriguing.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.041
I can find no match with

02:26.375 --> 02:29.041
anything in our records, sir.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.917
Change course to make

02:29.041 --> 02:31.917
a close sensor pass.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.583
We can then increase

02:31.917 --> 02:34.583
warp speed and reach

02:34.583 --> 02:36.583
Parliament on schedule.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.583
Aye, sir.

02:41.834 --> 02:44.166
So, Worf, why

02:41.834 --> 02:44.166
the interest in this?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.959
It's just routine maintenance

02:44.166 --> 02:46.959
on the sensor assemblies.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.667
Simple, Geordi.

02:48.667 --> 02:50.709
Our captain wants

02:48.667 --> 02:50.709
his junior officers

02:50.709 --> 02:52.917
to learn, learn, learn.

02:52.917 --> 02:54.875
Not just his junior ones.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.083
Okay, you hold

02:54.875 --> 02:57.083
this relay off-line

02:57.083 --> 02:58.625
while I adjust

02:57.083 --> 02:58.625
these sensor circuits.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.333
Security to

02:58.625 --> 03:00.333
Sensor Maintenance.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.083
Lieutenant

03:00.333 --> 03:02.083
La Forge here.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.750
We're making a close sensor pass

03:02.083 --> 03:05.750
on an unusual object, Geordi.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.333
Any problems?

03:07.333 --> 03:08.834
Not at all, Lieutenant.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.834
All equipment on-line

03:08.834 --> 03:10.834
and functioning.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.000
Sensors ready, sir.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.750
Life-form reading?

03:13.750 --> 03:15.542
No life-form reading, sir.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.208
Begin the pass.

03:20.542 --> 03:23.709
Sir, it is changing shape.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.166
Any readings of matter there?

03:26.166 --> 03:27.542
Negative, sir.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.709
Energy only.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.333
(<i> screaming</i> )

03:58.709 --> 04:00.750
Worf!

04:05.834 --> 04:07.417
La Forge to Sick Bay.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.417
We have a medical emergency

04:07.417 --> 04:09.417
in Sensor Maintenance.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.375
I repeat, this is

04:09.417 --> 04:12.375
a medical emergency.

04:32.792 --> 04:36.458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:36.458 --> 04:41.458
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:36.458 --> 04:41.458
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:43.667 --> 04:46.667
<i>to explore</i>

04:43.667 --> 04:46.667
<i>strange new worlds</i>

04:46.667 --> 04:51.667
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:46.667 --> 04:51.667
<i>and new civilizations</i>

04:51.667 --> 04:56.333
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:51.667 --> 04:56.333
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

06:00.125 --> 06:01.834
What happened?

06:00.125 --> 06:01.834
I don't know.

06:01.834 --> 06:04.417
He got hit by some sensor

06:01.834 --> 06:04.417
feedback, maybe.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.583
(<i> shouts</i> )

06:10.208 --> 06:12.083
You got it, Doc?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.375
I got it.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.000
Lieutenant Worf, can you

06:20.083 --> 06:23.000
hear what I'm saying?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.917
(<i> grunts</i> )

06:26.917 --> 06:28.875
Let's get him up.

06:26.917 --> 06:28.875
Okay.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.250
Come on, big guy.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.250
On your feet.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.291
Here we go.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.333
That's it.

06:39.291 --> 06:40.750
Are you okay?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.875
He was just monitoring

06:42.500 --> 06:44.875
the sensor console

06:44.875 --> 06:47.625
when he jerked as though

06:44.875 --> 06:47.625
something hit him.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.625
What my sensors showed was...

06:50.625 --> 06:52.917
it was a glow...

06:52.917 --> 06:54.333
just for a second.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.166
I can't explain it.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.834
Could your visor device

06:56.166 --> 06:58.834
have malfunctioned?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.667
I doubt it, sir.

07:00.667 --> 07:03.000
It seemed like what I was seeing

07:00.667 --> 07:03.000
was something real.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.375
(<i> growls</i> )

07:12.000 --> 07:13.959
Sorry to call you, sir.

07:13.959 --> 07:15.959
Not strictly security.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.500
It's about the

07:15.959 --> 07:18.500
dietary requirements

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
of the Antican delegates.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.250
I thought that had been

07:20.500 --> 07:23.250
taken care of in advance, Tasha.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.500
So did we, sir.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.458
Their live animals

07:24.500 --> 07:26.458
were beamed aboard.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.959
We were going to preserve

07:26.458 --> 07:28.959
the meat for them...

07:28.959 --> 07:31.792
but they say we must

07:28.959 --> 07:31.792
bring it to them alive.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.500
Then do so.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.375
Lieutenant Yar was...

07:33.500 --> 07:37.375
confused.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.208
We no longer enslave animals

07:37.375 --> 07:40.208
for food purposes.

07:40.208 --> 07:44.000
But we have seen

07:40.208 --> 07:44.000
humans eat meat.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.208
You've seen something

07:44.000 --> 07:47.208
as fresh and tasty as meat,

07:47.208 --> 07:49.291
but inorganically materialized

07:49.291 --> 07:52.166
out of patterns

07:49.291 --> 07:52.166
used by our transporters.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.125
Sickening!

07:58.208 --> 07:59.959
It's barbaric!

08:23.959 --> 08:26.750
He's reading normal now.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.041
How did you manage that?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.125
Yes. Normal.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.542
Are you all right?

08:32.542 --> 08:34.542
Yes. Perfectly.

08:35.625 --> 08:39.458
Both of us...

08:35.625 --> 08:39.458
quite normal now.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.625
Where-- where am I?

08:45.625 --> 08:48.083
Don't you remember?

08:48.083 --> 08:50.417
You were in the

08:48.083 --> 08:50.417
sensor maintenance room.

08:50.417 --> 08:53.750
I remember monitoring

08:50.417 --> 08:53.750
the sensor console.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.125
What am I doing here?

08:56.125 --> 08:58.792
That's a story

08:56.125 --> 08:58.792
the doctor will tell you.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.834
Obviously, you seem to feel

09:08.542 --> 09:10.834
it's something

09:10.834 --> 09:12.625
we should look at

09:10.834 --> 09:12.625
more carefully.

09:12.625 --> 09:14.083
A mystery is

09:12.625 --> 09:14.083
only a mystery

09:14.083 --> 09:15.917
as long as it remains

09:14.083 --> 09:15.917
un-investigated, sir.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.166
Mm, I love a mystery, Data,

09:18.166 --> 09:19.625
but this one

09:18.166 --> 09:19.625
will have to wait

09:19.625 --> 09:21.291
until we've delivered

09:19.625 --> 09:21.291
the delegates

09:21.291 --> 09:23.083
to their peace conference

09:21.291 --> 09:23.083
on Parliament.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.333
Time and tide,

09:24.333 --> 09:26.333
Lieutenant La Forge.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.208
Go to warp 8.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.625
Warp 8, sir.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.291
Hi, Mom.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.291
You're back early.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.458
Yes.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.625
Physical sciences class.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.166
We're studying Dr. Channing's

09:52.625 --> 09:56.166
theory on dilithium crystals.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.500
Tell me about it.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.000
Really?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.875
You never seemed that interested

10:00.000 --> 10:02.875
in warp theory before.

10:02.875 --> 10:06.792
Doctor Channing thinks it's

10:02.875 --> 10:06.792
possible to force dilithium

10:06.792 --> 10:08.709
into even more useful crystals.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.250
If, as shown here,

10:10.250 --> 10:12.583
matter and antimatter

10:10.250 --> 10:12.583
could be aligned

10:12.583 --> 10:13.834
even more efficiently...

10:13.834 --> 10:15.166
Would that affect navigation?

10:15.166 --> 10:18.375
This is engineering,

10:15.166 --> 10:18.375
not helm control.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.667
Oh, yes,

10:20.667 --> 10:23.667
the helm's located

10:20.667 --> 10:23.667
on the bridge.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.709
Mom?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.625
Is something wrong?

10:43.333 --> 10:46.000
This is the helm.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.750
Unless there have been

10:46.000 --> 10:49.750
some changes I don't know about.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.750
Dr. Crusher?

10:53.709 --> 10:56.542
You will

10:53.709 --> 10:56.542
wish to know

10:56.542 --> 10:58.125
Lieutenant Worf

10:56.542 --> 10:58.125
is much improved.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.542
Ready to return to duty.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.083
What was the diagnosis?

11:01.083 --> 11:03.125
A temporary

11:01.083 --> 11:03.125
mental aberration.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.125
Doctor!

11:09.125 --> 11:12.834
When such a diagnosis

11:09.125 --> 11:12.834
concerns a bridge officer

11:12.834 --> 11:14.959
I expect a better

11:12.834 --> 11:14.959
explanation.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.792
Then I will have to first

11:14.959 --> 11:16.792
run some cross-checks

11:16.792 --> 11:19.291
on the library computer.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.917
Klingons are so unusual

11:19.291 --> 11:21.917
in their reactions,

11:21.917 --> 11:23.959
aren't they?

11:25.417 --> 11:27.792
Use Science

11:25.417 --> 11:27.792
Station 2, Doctor.

11:40.041 --> 11:43.792
Intriguing, Doctor.

11:43.792 --> 11:47.875
What does helm control have

11:43.792 --> 11:47.875
to do with medical cross-checks?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.250
Why am I...

12:06.250 --> 12:08.834
Is something wrong, Doctor?

12:08.834 --> 12:11.417
Doctor?

12:08.834 --> 12:11.417
Are you all right?

12:12.709 --> 12:14.291
Yes.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.834
Yes.

12:17.834 --> 12:21.250
I'll do my work

12:17.834 --> 12:21.250
in my office.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.375
That's where

12:21.250 --> 12:23.375
I should be.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.458
Do you want someone

12:23.375 --> 12:25.458
to accompany you?

12:29.166 --> 12:33.125
Captain, there is

12:29.166 --> 12:33.125
a malfunction in this station.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.458
I cannot bring

12:33.125 --> 12:35.458
any information up on it.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.333
Science 2 does not

12:37.750 --> 12:40.333
function either, sir.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.750
Engineering to Captain Picard.

12:42.750 --> 12:46.333
We have something wrong with

12:42.750 --> 12:46.333
warp drive circuitry, sir.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.000
Transporter Room 6 to Bridge.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.583
Reporting transporter

12:49.000 --> 12:52.583
console malfunction, sir.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.083
Data, this ship is less than

12:59.500 --> 13:03.083
a year out of spacedock.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.917
What are the chances

13:03.083 --> 13:06.917
of this occurring?

13:06.917 --> 13:10.291
It is a virtual

13:06.917 --> 13:10.291
impossibility, sir.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.792
So what the hell

13:10.291 --> 13:13.792
is going on here?

13:32.125 --> 13:34.458
And you're telling me

13:32.125 --> 13:34.458
that there are no explanations

13:34.458 --> 13:35.709
for these malfunctions?

13:35.709 --> 13:38.375
At least, sir,

13:35.709 --> 13:38.375
all the department heads

13:38.375 --> 13:40.250
reported the

13:38.375 --> 13:40.250
damage repaired.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.166
That was not my question,

13:40.250 --> 13:42.166
Number One.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.333
What caused

13:42.166 --> 13:44.333
the malfunctions?

13:45.875 --> 13:48.458
I believe it was a

13:45.875 --> 13:48.458
rampant electronic short

13:48.458 --> 13:51.000
that jumped from system

13:48.458 --> 13:51.000
to system, sir.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.667
But the only thing is, um...

13:52.667 --> 13:54.542
Yes, Mr. Singh?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.166
That shouldn't be possible.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.834
The affected systems

13:57.166 --> 14:00.834
don't generally interact

13:57.166 --> 14:00.834
with each other.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.792
And where

14:00.834 --> 14:02.792
they do, well...

14:02.792 --> 14:05.625
it wasn't an interlink

14:02.792 --> 14:05.625
that was malfunctioning.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.458
Have you spoken

14:05.625 --> 14:08.458
with Chief Engineer Argyle

14:08.458 --> 14:09.750
about this problem?

14:09.750 --> 14:12.333
With all the engineering

14:09.750 --> 14:12.333
staff, sir.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.834
They're just as puzzled.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.083
Well, I'm not satisfied.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.667
I want an explanation

14:16.083 --> 14:17.667
of this

14:17.667 --> 14:19.458
by the time

14:17.667 --> 14:19.458
we reach Parliament.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.125
But, sir...

14:21.125 --> 14:23.792
By the time we reach

14:21.125 --> 14:23.792
Parliament, Mr. Singh.

14:32.625 --> 14:35.458
These weapons were taken

14:32.625 --> 14:35.458
from two of your people

14:35.458 --> 14:37.250
who were loitering

14:35.458 --> 14:37.250
out of sight

14:37.250 --> 14:39.458
in the vicinity of the Selay

14:37.250 --> 14:39.458
delegation's quarters.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.750
Do you care

14:39.458 --> 14:41.750
to explain, sir?

14:41.750 --> 14:44.125
These are not weapons,

14:41.750 --> 14:44.125
First Officer.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.667
They are tools.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.667
We use these to dispatch

14:45.667 --> 14:49.667
the animals we consume.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.417
Your food supply is not

14:49.667 --> 14:51.417
on the same deck

14:51.417 --> 14:52.917
as the Selay

14:51.417 --> 14:52.917
delegation, sir.

14:52.917 --> 14:55.250
And you have to admit

14:52.917 --> 14:55.250
that these could kill.

14:55.250 --> 14:59.041
I admit some of my people

14:55.250 --> 14:59.041
are impulsive

14:59.041 --> 15:02.792
and we all have reason

14:59.041 --> 15:02.792
to hate the Selay.

15:02.792 --> 15:05.291
They appear to have the same

15:02.792 --> 15:05.291
feelings about you, sir.

15:05.291 --> 15:07.583
Ah, the nature

15:05.291 --> 15:07.583
of politics.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.417
Nevertheless,

15:07.583 --> 15:09.417
Chief Delegate,

15:09.417 --> 15:11.166
you are on notice

15:09.417 --> 15:11.166
that all of your weapons,

15:11.166 --> 15:13.000
no matter what their

15:11.166 --> 15:13.000
basic function,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.125
are being confiscated.

15:15.125 --> 15:18.041
Violence will not be

15:15.125 --> 15:18.041
tolerated on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

15:21.125 --> 15:22.542
Of course not.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.083
And if any does occur,

15:22.542 --> 15:25.083
let me assure you

15:25.083 --> 15:28.208
it will not be

15:25.083 --> 15:28.208
we Anticans who start it.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.875
Thank you, sir.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.458
But...

15:36.458 --> 15:40.166
we will finish it.

15:40.166 --> 15:43.041
Sir, warp power is fading.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.875
Picard to Engineering.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.125
What is the problem?

15:49.125 --> 15:52.375
We've lost the warp engine

15:49.125 --> 15:52.375
computer tie.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.500
Warp five... four...

15:54.500 --> 15:56.750
three... two...

16:00.792 --> 16:02.959
State-of-the-art vessel?

16:02.959 --> 16:05.458
Data, signal Parliament

16:02.959 --> 16:05.458
we'll be delayed.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
We will send

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
a new arrival time

16:07.458 --> 16:09.875
as soon as it is determined.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.458
Sir...

16:11.458 --> 16:13.667
subspace radio is out.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.417
All right, gentlemen.

16:27.417 --> 16:31.208
Your theories on this sudden

16:27.417 --> 16:31.208
vulnerability in our systems.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.333
If the<i> Enterprise</i> were

16:31.208 --> 16:34.333
really this fragile, sir,

16:34.333 --> 16:36.542
she never would

16:34.333 --> 16:36.542
have left spacedock.

16:36.542 --> 16:39.583
Therefore, her systems' failures

16:36.542 --> 16:39.583
are not endemic to the ship

16:39.583 --> 16:42.500
but are the result of the

16:39.583 --> 16:42.500
actions of an unknown adversary.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.917
We have a saboteur aboard.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.917
I believe I said that.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.208
Gentlemen,

16:46.917 --> 16:50.208
the question is who?

16:50.208 --> 16:52.750
I can't believe it's

16:50.208 --> 16:52.750
one of our own people.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.000
Agreed. There must be someone

16:52.750 --> 16:56.000
from either alien delegation.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.417
If the Ferengi could have bought

16:56.000 --> 16:59.417
or bribed even one of them

16:59.417 --> 17:00.667
that's all they'd need.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.709
Ferengi contacts

17:00.667 --> 17:02.709
have been detected

17:02.709 --> 17:05.000
on both Selay

17:02.709 --> 17:05.000
and Antica, sir.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.667
Can either of you suggest

17:05.000 --> 17:07.667
any other suspects?

17:07.667 --> 17:10.333
You're sounding like

17:07.667 --> 17:10.333
a private eye, sir.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.417
Inquiry: private eye?

17:14.417 --> 17:17.583
A private consulting

17:14.417 --> 17:17.583
investigator, Data--

17:17.583 --> 17:19.041
who solves crimes.

17:19.041 --> 17:22.375
Hmm.

17:19.041 --> 17:22.375
Most interesting occupation.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.875
In the world of fact,

17:23.542 --> 17:26.875
probably not.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.959
However in literature,

17:26.875 --> 17:29.959
criminal detection

17:29.959 --> 17:32.583
can be a fascinating exercise.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.959
The immortal Sherlock Holmes

17:32.583 --> 17:34.959
would have an interesting

17:34.959 --> 17:36.500
view of our mystery,

17:34.959 --> 17:36.500
I believe.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.083
But I'm afraid we're going

17:36.500 --> 17:38.083
to have to find

17:38.083 --> 17:40.208
our solution without history's

17:40.208 --> 17:42.375
greatest

17:40.208 --> 17:42.375
consulting detective.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.709
How about here,

17:49.542 --> 17:51.709
Mr. Singh?

17:57.458 --> 17:59.875
If the control network

17:57.458 --> 17:59.875
breaks off at this point...

17:59.875 --> 18:02.750
It bleeds warp engine

17:59.875 --> 18:02.750
commands off into dead ends.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.750
Excellent.

18:09.542 --> 18:12.375
Well, I believe I can handle

18:09.542 --> 18:12.375
it from here, Mr. Crusher.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.125
But, sir...

18:14.125 --> 18:17.542
You are scheduled

18:14.125 --> 18:17.542
for classwork now. Sorry.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.542
Yes, sir.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.250
But I don't learn nearly

18:24.542 --> 18:27.250
this much in school.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.959
Well, I tend to agree.

18:28.959 --> 18:31.417
But the captain's orders

18:28.959 --> 18:31.417
on this are very clear.

18:44.417 --> 18:45.875
Hi.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.375
Solve any new

18:48.792 --> 18:51.375
problems today?

18:51.375 --> 18:53.458
I was starting to,

18:51.375 --> 18:53.458
maybe.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.291
Mr. Singh sent me

18:53.458 --> 18:56.291
off to class.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.583
Wes, you're only

18:56.291 --> 18:58.583
an acting ensign.

18:58.583 --> 19:00.083
You've got to let the

18:58.583 --> 19:00.083
commissioned officers

19:00.083 --> 19:02.125
do some of the work.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.208
Mom, I've learned a lot

19:04.959 --> 19:08.208
more than they understand.

19:08.208 --> 19:11.125
For example--

19:08.208 --> 19:11.125
with Channing's

19:11.125 --> 19:13.834
dilithium crystals theory

19:11.125 --> 19:13.834
I was telling you about...

19:13.834 --> 19:15.875
When were you telling me

19:13.834 --> 19:15.875
about that?

19:15.875 --> 19:18.959
This morning.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.959
Don't you remember?

19:20.166 --> 19:22.542
Honestly,

19:20.166 --> 19:22.542
I don't remember.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.834
Engineering to Captain Picard.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.834
Security alert.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.250
Picard.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.250
Lieutenant Worf, sir.

20:02.250 --> 20:05.125
I just found Mr. Singh.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.834
He's dead.

20:14.625 --> 20:18.542
<i>Captain's log,</i>

20:14.625 --> 20:18.542
<i>stardate 41249.4.</i>

20:18.542 --> 20:21.542
<i>I've ordered</i>

20:18.542 --> 20:21.542
<i>an immediate investigation</i>

20:21.542 --> 20:24.291
<i>into the death of</i>

20:21.542 --> 20:24.291
<i>Assistant Chief Engineer Singh.</i>

20:24.291 --> 20:27.792
<i>We continue to run</i>

20:24.291 --> 20:27.792
<i>on impulse power.</i>

20:27.792 --> 20:29.750
He could have been

20:27.792 --> 20:29.750
working there

20:29.750 --> 20:31.458
restoring warp power.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.250
Well, according to

20:31.458 --> 20:33.250
these readings

20:33.250 --> 20:36.375
we can go back

20:33.250 --> 20:36.375
to warp speed now.

20:36.375 --> 20:39.291
Those aren't the same

20:36.375 --> 20:39.291
readings as when I left.

20:39.291 --> 20:42.917
Singh probably repaired it

20:39.291 --> 20:42.917
just before he was killed.

20:42.917 --> 20:45.208
He couldn't have

20:42.917 --> 20:45.208
repaired it, sir.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.917
The problems were

20:45.208 --> 20:47.917
inside the engines.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.667
Who else could have

20:47.917 --> 20:50.667
corrected it, Wes?

20:50.667 --> 20:53.625
Inform the bridge

20:50.667 --> 20:53.625
of engine status.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.709
Engineering to Bridge.

20:56.709 --> 20:59.500
We now have warp capacity, sir--

20:56.709 --> 20:59.500
all power on-line.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.834
Well done. Warp engines ready

20:59.500 --> 21:02.834
on previous heading.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.959
Warp factor 6.

21:09.959 --> 21:13.583
I tolerate these questions,

21:09.959 --> 21:13.583
Lieutenant Yar,

21:13.583 --> 21:16.834
because I need this vessel

21:13.583 --> 21:16.834
to get us to Parliament.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.959
Your shipboard problems

21:16.834 --> 21:19.959
do not concern me.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.750
They should.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.750
Our delays are your delays.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.750
(<i> growls</i> )

21:24.750 --> 21:27.041
The peace conference

21:24.750 --> 21:27.041
will wait for us.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.834
I must ask where you were

21:28.834 --> 21:31.667
during this vessel's

21:28.834 --> 21:31.667
Earth hours of 1800 last night

21:31.667 --> 21:33.959
and 0700 this morning?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.166
Eating.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.417
Sir, we're talking

21:35.166 --> 21:38.417
about hours here.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.375
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:45.709 --> 21:49.458
It was a large meal,

21:45.709 --> 21:49.458
Lieutenant Yar,

21:49.458 --> 21:52.834
and a very interesting animal.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.000
You wanted me, Doctor?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.917
Yes, concerning

22:02.000 --> 22:04.917
your memory blackout.

22:04.917 --> 22:08.333
I still don't remember

22:04.917 --> 22:08.333
having one.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.208
The same thing happened to me.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.291
I want to try hypnosis

22:10.208 --> 22:13.291
on both of you.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.959
It may restore your memory

22:13.291 --> 22:15.959
as to what happened.

22:17.917 --> 22:21.750
One thing is clear-- almost

22:17.917 --> 22:21.750
all of the peace delegates

22:21.750 --> 22:23.750
answered our questions

22:21.750 --> 22:23.750
with lies.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.083
Imprecise, Lieutenant.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.291
They omitted certain truths

22:28.291 --> 22:31.041
which in itself

22:28.291 --> 22:31.041
tells us something.

22:31.041 --> 22:34.208
We can learn something

22:31.041 --> 22:34.208
from nondisclosure?

22:35.750 --> 22:38.417
Indubitably, my good woman.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.917
It's something

22:41.291 --> 22:43.917
the captain mentioned.

22:43.917 --> 22:45.458
Sherlock Holmes.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.417
Indubitably...

22:47.417 --> 22:49.250
Data has been

22:47.417 --> 22:49.250
studying him.

22:49.250 --> 22:52.625
Has studied, sir, every case.

22:52.625 --> 22:54.750
As Holmes would have

22:52.625 --> 22:54.750
pointed out,

22:54.750 --> 22:58.583
during the time in question,

22:54.750 --> 22:58.583
something was afoot.

22:58.583 --> 23:00.250
Afoot?

23:00.250 --> 23:01.625
While both sets of delegates

23:01.625 --> 23:03.250
say they were

23:01.625 --> 23:03.250
in their quarters,

23:03.250 --> 23:07.041
our crew locator sensed them

23:03.250 --> 23:07.041
passing here and here.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.959
But since it doesn't show

23:10.750 --> 23:12.959
where they went,

23:12.959 --> 23:14.208
we're still in the dark.

23:14.208 --> 23:18.125
On the contrary,

23:14.208 --> 23:18.125
my dear colleague.

23:21.583 --> 23:24.834
On their return,

23:21.583 --> 23:24.834
they drew medical supplies

23:24.834 --> 23:27.417
appropriate to the treatment

23:24.834 --> 23:27.417
of minor wounds and abrasions

23:27.417 --> 23:28.750
on these

23:27.417 --> 23:28.750
life-forms.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.417
Which leaves us

23:28.750 --> 23:30.417
with only one conclusion.

23:30.417 --> 23:31.834
Exactly.

23:31.834 --> 23:33.542
That they were too engaged

23:31.834 --> 23:33.542
in their own affairs

23:33.542 --> 23:35.750
to have disabled the ship

23:33.542 --> 23:35.750
and murdered the engineer.

23:35.750 --> 23:39.083
Given the choice, they would

23:35.750 --> 23:39.083
rather kill each other

23:39.083 --> 23:41.083
than any of us.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.333
It's elementary,

23:43.333 --> 23:45.959
my dear Riker.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.375
Sir.

23:51.417 --> 23:54.083
Beverly, can you hear me?

23:54.083 --> 23:56.041
Yes.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.542
I want you to go back

24:01.041 --> 24:03.542
in your mind

24:03.542 --> 24:05.709
to the moment

24:03.542 --> 24:05.709
when you first recall

24:05.709 --> 24:08.542
this sensation

24:05.709 --> 24:08.542
of memory loss.

24:08.542 --> 24:11.959
Picture it exactly

24:08.542 --> 24:11.959
as it occurred.

24:13.208 --> 24:17.083
He's lying on

24:13.208 --> 24:17.083
the hospital bed, sedated.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.208
I'm walking up to him...

24:20.208 --> 24:22.041
I...

24:24.583 --> 24:26.667
How do you feel at this moment

24:26.667 --> 24:29.291
as you lean over him

24:26.667 --> 24:29.291
to take the specimen?

24:29.291 --> 24:32.291
I feel...

24:32.291 --> 24:34.875
someone else...

24:34.875 --> 24:38.166
There's someone else

24:34.875 --> 24:38.166
who's there.

24:38.166 --> 24:41.041
Not a... not alone.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.792
Get out.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.792
Get out of my mind.

24:54.583 --> 24:58.417
That's almost

24:54.583 --> 24:58.417
exactly what you said.

24:58.417 --> 25:00.792
As though there were

24:58.417 --> 25:00.792
something else inside you.

25:03.041 --> 25:06.375
Which confirms the feeling

25:03.041 --> 25:06.375
of duality that I sensed

25:06.375 --> 25:07.709
earlier in both of them.

25:07.709 --> 25:09.417
Why didn't you report it?

25:09.417 --> 25:12.959
Because, sir,

25:09.417 --> 25:12.959
I assumed at first

25:12.959 --> 25:16.542
it was the kind of duality that

25:12.959 --> 25:16.542
we Betazeds feel in all of you.

25:16.542 --> 25:19.041
Even you, sir.

25:19.041 --> 25:21.500
When you approach

25:19.041 --> 25:21.500
a decision

25:21.500 --> 25:24.500
and ask yourself

25:21.500 --> 25:24.500
which direction to go,

25:24.500 --> 25:26.291
who are you

25:24.500 --> 25:26.291
talking to?

25:26.291 --> 25:28.083
Hmm.

25:28.083 --> 25:32.041
Your hypnotism revealed

25:28.083 --> 25:32.041
another form of duality?

25:32.041 --> 25:33.917
Yes, sir.

25:33.917 --> 25:36.250
I believe something

25:33.917 --> 25:36.250
invaded them.

25:36.250 --> 25:39.709
It's the only

25:36.250 --> 25:39.709
possible conclusion.

25:41.959 --> 25:43.291
Data...

25:45.041 --> 25:47.834
Let's proceed

25:45.041 --> 25:47.834
without the pipe.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.458
Yes, sir, if you wish, sir.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.458
But I ask if you take it

25:52.750 --> 25:55.458
as incontrovertible

25:55.458 --> 25:57.208
that it cannot be

25:55.458 --> 25:57.208
a family member

25:57.208 --> 25:59.000
or one of the crew?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.834
Yes, very unlikely.

26:01.834 --> 26:04.417
Then our investigation

26:01.834 --> 26:04.417
was worthwhile, sir.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.291
We've eliminated

26:04.417 --> 26:06.291
both the delegates

26:06.291 --> 26:08.542
and the ship's

26:06.291 --> 26:08.542
regular complement.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.542
Data, what are you suggesting?

26:13.458 --> 26:17.458
I am referring to the great

26:13.458 --> 26:17.458
detective's credo, sir.

26:17.458 --> 26:18.834
I quote--

26:18.834 --> 26:22.250
"We must fall back

26:18.834 --> 26:22.250
on the old axiom

26:22.250 --> 26:25.375
"that when other

26:22.250 --> 26:25.375
contingencies fail,

26:25.375 --> 26:29.458
"whatever remains

26:25.375 --> 26:29.458
however improbable

26:29.458 --> 26:33.291
must be the truth."

26:37.500 --> 26:39.750
(<i> water gurgles</i> )

26:42.291 --> 26:46.125
That engine computer net

26:42.291 --> 26:46.125
wasn't repaired, sir.

26:46.125 --> 26:49.166
It just suddenly

26:46.125 --> 26:49.166
became all right.

26:49.166 --> 26:51.875
Sometimes, it's the result

26:49.166 --> 26:51.875
that counts, you know?

26:51.875 --> 26:54.542
What the... oh, no.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.333
What is it?

26:58.333 --> 27:00.834
Helm control just went down.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.834
She won't respond.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.667
Bridge to Captain.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.667
You're needed here immediately.

27:03.667 --> 27:06.917
Wes, alert engineering from

27:03.667 --> 27:06.917
your panel, all right?

27:06.917 --> 27:09.083
I'm trying.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.917
Report.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.792
Helm is down, sir.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.667
There's no apparent reason.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.083
Captain, we've just dropped

27:14.667 --> 27:17.083
to impulse power.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.792
Sir, are you all right?

27:31.792 --> 27:33.917
I thought I just saw...

27:33.917 --> 27:36.625
I'm fine.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.166
Everything is fine now.

27:54.917 --> 27:58.000
Why the drop to impulse power,

27:54.917 --> 27:58.000
Lieutenant?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
The helm is suddenly

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
malfunctioning, sir.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.917
Malfunctioning?

28:01.917 --> 28:03.709
You're wrong. Look again.

28:03.709 --> 28:05.333
Captain, I was just...

28:07.667 --> 28:09.458
Mr. La Forge?

28:09.458 --> 28:11.959
Well, there's nothing

28:09.458 --> 28:11.959
wrong with it now, sir.

28:11.959 --> 28:14.417
Everything is

28:11.959 --> 28:14.417
just as it should be.

28:14.417 --> 28:17.959
In that case,

28:14.417 --> 28:17.959
make our heading

28:17.959 --> 28:22.291
925 mark 3... 7.

28:22.291 --> 28:24.875
Sir?

28:24.875 --> 28:28.000
You have a problem

28:24.875 --> 28:28.000
with that heading, Lieutenant?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.792
You want to double back

28:28.000 --> 28:30.792
on our course, sir?

28:33.291 --> 28:35.959
Isn't that what I ordered?

28:37.959 --> 28:40.125
GEORDI:

28:37.959 --> 28:40.125
Yes, sir.

28:51.667 --> 28:55.834
Sir... I'm puzzled by

28:51.667 --> 28:55.834
your reversing our course.

28:55.834 --> 28:59.375
That energy cloud, Commander.

28:59.375 --> 29:02.083
I believe it important

28:59.375 --> 29:02.083
we have another look at it.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.625
But we're behind schedule

29:02.083 --> 29:04.625
for Parliament already.

29:04.625 --> 29:07.875
I believe a very important

29:04.625 --> 29:07.875
scientific discovery

29:07.875 --> 29:09.667
awaits us on this heading.

29:09.667 --> 29:12.917
Perhaps you'd like to share

29:09.667 --> 29:12.917
your reasoning on that, sir?

29:12.917 --> 29:16.000
Yes, since we obtained

29:12.917 --> 29:16.000
only minimal information

29:16.000 --> 29:17.750
on our sensor pass of it.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.417
Right, Data.

29:19.417 --> 29:21.959
We must go back to learn more.

29:23.417 --> 29:24.959
Counselor...

29:24.959 --> 29:27.291
do you believe

29:24.959 --> 29:27.291
a ship captain

29:27.291 --> 29:29.709
should explain<i> every</i> order?

29:31.917 --> 29:33.834
Of course not, sir.

29:40.417 --> 29:43.250
I demand to see

29:40.417 --> 29:43.250
the captain!

29:43.250 --> 29:46.041
Stop! Return

29:43.250 --> 29:46.041
to your quarters!

29:46.041 --> 29:47.417
(<i> shriek of disgust</i> )

29:47.417 --> 29:49.917
What is that doing

29:47.417 --> 29:49.917
on our deck?

29:49.917 --> 29:53.875
I demand to know why this

29:49.917 --> 29:53.875
starship has changed its course!

29:53.875 --> 29:56.834
Please return

29:53.875 --> 29:56.834
to your quarters, delegates.

29:56.834 --> 29:59.291
(<i> hostile growls</i> )

29:59.291 --> 30:03.333
A mere change of direction

29:59.291 --> 30:03.333
hardly justifies mutiny.

30:03.333 --> 30:07.083
Exactly what do you believe

30:03.333 --> 30:07.083
you're sensing from him?

30:07.083 --> 30:09.291
It's just the

30:07.083 --> 30:09.291
feeling that...

30:09.291 --> 30:13.208
well, that he's closed

30:09.291 --> 30:13.208
part of his mind to me.

30:13.208 --> 30:15.375
I just feel

30:15.375 --> 30:18.000
that the captain

30:15.375 --> 30:18.000
has become...

30:18.000 --> 30:20.375
perhaps dangerous.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.959
If he's dangerous...

30:24.959 --> 30:26.458
<i>if...</i>

30:26.458 --> 30:29.083
Then he'd have to be

30:26.458 --> 30:29.083
relieved of command.

30:30.667 --> 30:31.959
Which you could do, Doctor.

30:31.959 --> 30:34.041
It's<i> beaucoup</i> trouble

30:31.959 --> 30:34.041
if you're wrong.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.125
And at the moment,

30:34.041 --> 30:37.125
it is all pure speculation.

30:37.125 --> 30:40.500
He's done nothing to subject

30:37.125 --> 30:40.500
the<i> Enterprise</i> to danger.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.542
I'd need a medical log citing

30:40.500 --> 30:44.542
clear evidence of incapacity.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.750
You could do it

30:44.542 --> 30:47.750
without that problem.

30:47.750 --> 30:51.875
Only if all command officers

30:47.750 --> 30:51.875
agreed it was vital to do so.

30:51.875 --> 30:56.083
But he has not been showing

30:51.875 --> 30:56.083
any overt unusual behavior.

30:56.083 --> 30:59.750
Ultimately,

30:56.083 --> 30:59.750
I believe he will.

31:02.917 --> 31:05.917
As second in command,

31:02.917 --> 31:05.917
it's still in your corner.

31:05.917 --> 31:08.583
I'll order medical

31:05.917 --> 31:08.583
and psychiatric exams.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.917
You'll have to back

31:11.250 --> 31:13.917
me up somehow.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.959
<i>First officer's log,</i>

31:21.458 --> 31:23.959
<i>supplemental.</i>

31:23.959 --> 31:26.709
<i>After meeting</i>

31:23.959 --> 31:26.709
<i>with the senior officers,</i>

31:26.709 --> 31:29.125
<i>Dr. Crusher and I have decided</i>

31:26.709 --> 31:29.125
<i>to approach the captain</i>

31:29.125 --> 31:31.250
<i>regarding his recent behavior.</i>

31:33.875 --> 31:35.333
(<i> door shuts</i> )

31:35.333 --> 31:36.709
Yes?

31:39.333 --> 31:42.125
I'd like you to come

31:39.333 --> 31:42.125
to Sick Bay

31:42.125 --> 31:44.333
for some examinations,

31:42.125 --> 31:44.333
Captain.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.917
Oh?

31:45.917 --> 31:48.625
I'd be glad to,

31:45.917 --> 31:48.625
when I'm free.

31:49.917 --> 31:52.458
I'd like to conduct

31:49.917 --> 31:52.458
them now, sir.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.417
Why?

31:59.291 --> 32:01.458
What can I do for you,

31:59.291 --> 32:01.458
Number One?

32:01.458 --> 32:04.667
Sir, counselor Troi has

32:01.458 --> 32:04.667
recommended the examinations.

32:04.667 --> 32:07.500
Same question-- why?

32:10.125 --> 32:12.542
It is my duty to

32:10.125 --> 32:12.542
inform the captain

32:12.542 --> 32:15.375
we believe he may be under

32:12.542 --> 32:15.375
some kind of alien influence

32:15.375 --> 32:19.125
which may constitute

32:15.375 --> 32:19.125
a danger to this ship.

32:23.667 --> 32:26.208
I consider it

32:23.667 --> 32:26.208
equally possible

32:26.208 --> 32:28.125
that the two of you,

32:28.125 --> 32:30.166
and counselor Troi,

32:30.166 --> 32:32.333
are overworked

32:32.333 --> 32:34.667
and possibly suffering

32:32.333 --> 32:34.667
hallucinations.

32:34.667 --> 32:36.291
Now, this is an order--

32:36.291 --> 32:39.041
you will arrange medical

32:36.291 --> 32:39.041
and psychiatric exams

32:39.041 --> 32:41.333
both for yourself

32:39.041 --> 32:41.333
and them.

32:43.041 --> 32:46.875
Doctor, are you aware everyone

32:43.041 --> 32:46.875
is behaving strangely?

32:46.875 --> 32:49.291
I'm concerned that

32:46.875 --> 32:49.291
you've suddenly turned

32:49.291 --> 32:50.667
the ship away

32:49.291 --> 32:50.667
from its course...

32:50.667 --> 32:52.792
What's happened

32:50.667 --> 32:52.792
to your mind, Doctor?

32:58.500 --> 33:02.166
The search for knowledge is

32:58.500 --> 33:02.166
always our primary mission.

33:04.834 --> 33:06.375
I'm sorry. I...

33:06.375 --> 33:09.959
I really am too busy

33:06.375 --> 33:09.959
for this kind of nonsense.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.583
Do I have to call security

33:13.583 --> 33:16.250
to force you to report

33:13.583 --> 33:16.250
to the Sick Bay?

33:16.250 --> 33:17.917
No, sir.

33:38.208 --> 33:40.041
What the hell?!

33:42.083 --> 33:44.291
Sorry, wrong species.

33:46.583 --> 33:47.917
Riker to security chief!

33:47.917 --> 33:49.208
Yar here.

33:49.208 --> 33:51.458
Security guard

33:49.208 --> 33:51.458
to the engineering deck.

33:51.458 --> 33:54.709
The Selays are playing

33:51.458 --> 33:54.709
hide-and-seek down here,

33:51.458 --> 33:54.709
obviously with the Anticans.

33:54.709 --> 33:56.208
It's a lethal game.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.250
I want them returned

33:56.208 --> 33:58.250
to quarters, under guard!

33:58.250 --> 33:59.625
Right away, sir.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.208
(<i> chime sounds</i> )

34:04.583 --> 34:06.208
Come.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.709
What do you want?

34:13.709 --> 34:17.291
Here are the results from the

34:13.709 --> 34:17.291
exams you ordered, sir.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.709
You don't care

34:26.625 --> 34:29.709
to inspect them?

34:32.625 --> 34:34.542
Please...

34:34.542 --> 34:36.458
are you Jean-Luc?

34:36.458 --> 34:38.792
He is here.

34:38.792 --> 34:40.875
The Jean-Luc I know?

34:40.875 --> 34:42.959
And more.

34:42.959 --> 34:46.000
The more frightens me.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.792
And elates us.

34:47.792 --> 34:51.458
We wish you could understand

34:47.792 --> 34:51.458
the glorious adventure ahead.

34:51.458 --> 34:54.250
You and...

34:56.041 --> 34:58.417
Soon we'll both be home.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.166
<i>First officer's log,</i>

35:07.083 --> 35:09.166
<i>supplemental.</i>

35:09.166 --> 35:11.166
<i>On the orders</i>

35:09.166 --> 35:11.166
<i>of Captain Picard,</i>

35:11.166 --> 35:12.875
<i>we have returned</i>

35:11.166 --> 35:12.875
<i>to the vicinity</i>

35:12.875 --> 35:14.583
<i>of the energy pattern cloud.</i>

35:14.583 --> 35:16.375
<i>I am personally convinced</i>

35:16.375 --> 35:18.542
<i>that something from this cloud</i>

35:18.542 --> 35:20.667
<i>now shares the captain's mind.</i>

35:20.667 --> 35:22.959
<i>But there seems to be</i>

35:20.667 --> 35:22.959
<i>nothing we can do--</i>

35:22.959 --> 35:24.792
<i>at least within regulations.</i>

35:24.792 --> 35:27.041
We're now approaching

35:24.792 --> 35:27.041
the cloud, sir.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.125
Very well, Mr. La Forge.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.750
Bring us to within 10,000

35:31.750 --> 35:34.750
kilometers and hold us there.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.500
Aye, sir.

35:41.959 --> 35:44.709
Shall we begin the scientific

35:41.959 --> 35:44.709
tests you wanted, sir?

35:44.709 --> 35:46.917
Oh, they're already underway.

35:54.542 --> 35:57.625
I have an announcement

35:54.542 --> 35:57.625
for the entire bridge.

35:57.625 --> 36:00.000
As many of you suspected,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.750
when our ship passed

36:00.000 --> 36:03.750
through the edge of this,

36:03.750 --> 36:07.000
it accidentally carried away

36:07.000 --> 36:08.667
a sentient being--

36:08.667 --> 36:12.417
much like these

36:08.667 --> 36:12.417
energy patterns

36:12.417 --> 36:14.625
we're seeing here.

36:14.625 --> 36:17.625
A terrifying experience

36:14.625 --> 36:17.625
for any intelligent being--

36:17.625 --> 36:21.291
as if a great claw reached

36:17.625 --> 36:21.291
down and scooped one of you

36:21.291 --> 36:23.125
from your home world.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.583
Drawn in to the energy

36:23.125 --> 36:25.583
circuits of this vessel.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.375
It found its way

36:25.583 --> 36:27.375
to you, Worf.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.709
Frantic at being taken

36:27.375 --> 36:29.709
from its home world

36:29.709 --> 36:31.709
and recognizing you

36:29.709 --> 36:31.709
as sentient beings,

36:31.709 --> 36:32.959
it pleaded for help,

36:32.959 --> 36:36.500
but in ways

36:32.959 --> 36:36.500
you couldn't understand.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.417
Desperately going

36:36.500 --> 36:39.417
from person to person.

36:39.417 --> 36:43.250
And then discovering

36:39.417 --> 36:43.250
the computer intelligence

36:43.250 --> 36:45.166
in this ship's

36:43.250 --> 36:45.166
memory circuits.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.959
Oh, simplistic intelligence--

36:47.959 --> 36:50.834
but it furnished it enough

36:50.834 --> 36:55.417
to slow this<i> Enterprise</i> thing

36:55.417 --> 36:57.500
that had captured it.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.208
And it very much regrets

37:00.208 --> 37:03.458
the accidental death

37:00.208 --> 37:03.458
of engineer Singh.

37:04.458 --> 37:06.125
Captain...

37:07.291 --> 37:10.041
do you exist

37:07.291 --> 37:10.041
in combination

37:10.041 --> 37:11.917
with this entity?

37:11.917 --> 37:13.875
Is it in control

37:11.917 --> 37:13.875
of you, sir?

37:13.875 --> 37:15.583
Very soon after

37:13.875 --> 37:15.583
we had combined

37:15.583 --> 37:17.583
we had learned much

37:15.583 --> 37:17.583
about each other.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.834
Passion for exploration,

37:17.583 --> 37:19.834
for the unknown--

37:19.834 --> 37:21.583
we found we had

37:19.834 --> 37:21.583
similar dreams.

37:21.583 --> 37:23.375
And it offered your

37:21.583 --> 37:23.375
captain a way

37:23.375 --> 37:25.083
to realize them

37:25.083 --> 37:26.542
beyond human

37:25.083 --> 37:26.542
expectations.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.750
RIKER:

37:26.542 --> 37:27.750
Captain!

37:27.750 --> 37:30.500
I must speak to you

37:27.750 --> 37:30.500
privately, now!

37:30.500 --> 37:32.792
I understand.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.542
As an energy pattern,

37:34.542 --> 37:36.542
free of the limitations

37:34.542 --> 37:36.542
of matter,

37:36.542 --> 37:39.000
he might travel anywhere.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.583
At any velocity.

37:40.583 --> 37:42.750
Captain, do you hear me?

37:42.750 --> 37:47.041
Sir, I see no way for you to

37:42.750 --> 37:47.041
journey with an energy form.

37:47.041 --> 37:48.917
Isn't there?

37:51.375 --> 37:53.750
He's planning to beam himself

37:53.750 --> 37:55.917
and the entity

37:53.750 --> 37:55.917
into that cloud.

37:57.500 --> 38:01.333
The transporter need not pattern

37:57.500 --> 38:01.333
your captain into matter.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.333
We'll beam energy only

38:03.333 --> 38:06.583
and we will become

38:03.333 --> 38:06.583
a combined energy pattern

38:06.583 --> 38:09.333
of our life-forms.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.417
A resignation from this command

38:09.333 --> 38:12.417
and from Starfleet has been

38:12.417 --> 38:13.500
appropriately

38:12.417 --> 38:13.500
recorded.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
I refuse to allow this, sir.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.208
How does this resignation

38:15.000 --> 38:18.208
threaten the ship

38:18.208 --> 38:19.583
or its crew in any way?

38:19.583 --> 38:21.417
Captain Picard, you are

38:19.583 --> 38:21.417
now relieved of duty.

38:21.417 --> 38:23.250
I judge you

38:21.417 --> 38:23.250
to be disabled

38:23.250 --> 38:25.417
and mentally

38:23.250 --> 38:25.417
incapacitated.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.208
RIKER:

38:27.208 --> 38:29.208
Security!

38:29.208 --> 38:31.291
Red alert!

38:31.291 --> 38:32.709
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

38:32.709 --> 38:34.500
Restrain the captain!

38:36.250 --> 38:38.375
Where is he?

38:38.375 --> 38:40.625
This is

38:38.375 --> 38:40.625
blinding me!

38:42.625 --> 38:44.792
WORF:

38:42.625 --> 38:44.792
Captain!

38:44.792 --> 38:47.208
I'll help you

38:44.792 --> 38:47.208
if you let me!

38:49.667 --> 38:52.083
Someone restrain the captain!

38:56.458 --> 38:59.000
(<i> alarm continuing</i> )

39:22.917 --> 39:25.500
RIKER:

39:22.917 --> 39:25.500
<i>First officer's log,</i>

39:22.917 --> 39:25.500
<i>supplemental.</i>

39:25.500 --> 39:27.417
<i>More than an hour has passed</i>

39:27.417 --> 39:29.625
<i>since the captain beamed out,</i>

39:27.417 --> 39:29.625
<i>energy only.</i>

39:29.625 --> 39:33.583
<i>Every effort has been made</i>

39:29.625 --> 39:33.583
<i>to determine his whereabouts.</i>

39:33.583 --> 39:35.000
The transporter

39:33.583 --> 39:35.000
chief has no idea

39:35.000 --> 39:36.625
what the coordinates

39:35.000 --> 39:36.625
were, sir.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.583
So he's just floating

39:36.625 --> 39:38.583
around out there?

39:38.583 --> 39:40.041
How can we

39:38.583 --> 39:40.041
settle for that?

39:40.041 --> 39:42.291
Give me a choice, then.

39:42.291 --> 39:45.208
Still no readings,

39:42.291 --> 39:45.208
no sign of anything.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.625
Mr. La Forge...

40:00.625 --> 40:03.500
it's time to set a course

40:00.625 --> 40:03.500
for Parliament.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.333
Warp 8.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.792
We're really leaving him?

40:08.792 --> 40:12.041
Commander... wait!

40:13.208 --> 40:15.583
It's the captain.

40:15.583 --> 40:17.667
But only the captain.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.875
He's out there alone.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.959
The entity,

40:19.875 --> 40:22.959
has it abandoned him?

40:22.959 --> 40:25.750
No.

40:25.750 --> 40:29.667
But the combination wasn't

40:25.750 --> 40:29.667
possible out there.

40:29.667 --> 40:33.041
He's in trouble,

40:29.667 --> 40:33.041
so we have to beam him back.

40:33.041 --> 40:35.834
Beam him back as what?

40:33.041 --> 40:35.834
He's nothing but energy now.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.125
Sir, the entity was caught

40:35.834 --> 40:39.125
in the ship's circuitry.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.583
The captain might try

40:40.583 --> 40:42.792
to get in the same way

40:40.583 --> 40:42.792
if he's in trouble.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.333
Bring us in closer, La Forge.

40:44.333 --> 40:47.083
Moving in, sir, but where?

40:47.083 --> 40:49.500
There's no way to know.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.291
Let's hope he can come

40:49.500 --> 40:52.291
part way himself.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.959
Troi, is there any way

41:00.291 --> 41:03.959
you can get a message to him?

41:03.959 --> 41:05.583
I wish I could.

41:05.583 --> 41:08.458
Sensors monitoring

41:05.583 --> 41:08.458
the perimeter...

41:09.458 --> 41:13.208
ship's circuitry, sir--

41:09.458 --> 41:13.208
nothing.

41:13.208 --> 41:15.709
Bring us right into the edge

41:13.208 --> 41:15.709
of it, La Forge.

41:15.709 --> 41:16.875
Aye, sir.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.500
Sir!

41:25.500 --> 41:27.000
On my sensor controls.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.750
There's something here.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.542
I feel it.

41:30.542 --> 41:34.500
Just as before,

41:30.542 --> 41:34.500
going to Worf first.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.750
Something crazy on my panel.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.959
Commander Riker...

41:42.709 --> 41:45.750
GEORDI:

41:42.709 --> 41:45.750
Static?

41:45.750 --> 41:47.750
"P" for Picard?

41:47.750 --> 41:50.250
He's in the ship's

41:47.750 --> 41:50.250
circuitry.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.917
Come to the transporter

41:50.250 --> 41:52.917
room, please.

41:52.917 --> 41:55.625
There might be

41:52.917 --> 41:55.625
a way, sir. Hurry!

42:04.792 --> 42:06.709
This is a wild theory, Data.

42:06.709 --> 42:10.083
I knew we had to have

42:06.709 --> 42:10.083
the captain's physical

42:06.709 --> 42:10.083
pattern here, sir.

42:10.083 --> 42:12.000
He was the last one

42:10.083 --> 42:12.000
to beam out.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.792
Is what you're

42:12.000 --> 42:13.792
thinking possible?

42:13.792 --> 42:15.458
Unknown at this time, sir.

42:15.458 --> 42:17.917
I hope the captain remembers

42:15.458 --> 42:17.917
his physical pattern is here.

42:17.917 --> 42:19.792
If he has,

42:17.917 --> 42:19.792
his energy has moved

42:19.792 --> 42:21.875
into the transporter

42:19.792 --> 42:21.875
relays by now.

42:21.875 --> 42:25.333
I wish we had some sign

42:21.875 --> 42:25.333
that he was in here.

42:25.333 --> 42:28.208
I guess we have no choice

42:25.333 --> 42:28.208
but to risk it.

42:28.208 --> 42:29.667
Energizing, sir.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.542
What the devil am I doing here?

43:01.542 --> 43:04.208
Sounds like our captain.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.834
But confused.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.834
This Picard pattern was formed

43:07.834 --> 43:09.417
before he went

43:07.834 --> 43:09.417
out there.

43:12.667 --> 43:16.000
What's happening to me,

43:12.667 --> 43:16.000
Number One?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.125
I was preparing to...

43:18.125 --> 43:20.208
to beam out...

43:20.208 --> 43:22.625
to somewhere.

43:22.625 --> 43:25.250
And I remember there

43:22.625 --> 43:25.250
was talk of an entity.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.959
But it all seems so vague.

43:27.959 --> 43:30.750
I believe the captain is now

43:27.959 --> 43:30.750
his separate self, sir.

43:30.750 --> 43:33.125
Much of what happened

43:30.750 --> 43:33.125
is naturally missing.

43:33.125 --> 43:35.083
What are you talking

43:33.125 --> 43:35.083
about, Data?

43:35.083 --> 43:36.875
Is this still

43:35.083 --> 43:36.875
Sherlock Holmes?

43:36.875 --> 43:39.417
Indubitably, sir.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.583
Indubitably.

43:41.583 --> 43:45.083
Hmm. At least you got rid

43:41.583 --> 43:45.083
of that damned pipe.

43:45.083 --> 43:48.208
Dr. Crusher has asked me

43:45.083 --> 43:48.208
to steer you past Sick Bay.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.917
She said you've been

43:48.208 --> 43:50.917
looking very tired.

43:50.917 --> 43:52.917
Captain!

43:50.917 --> 43:52.917
Yes, Lieutenant.

43:52.917 --> 43:56.458
Sorry, Commander,

43:52.917 --> 43:56.458
but Security Team Two reports

43:56.458 --> 43:58.959
they've discovered a puddle of

43:56.458 --> 43:58.959
blood outside the Selay quarters

43:58.959 --> 44:01.291
and they can't find

43:58.959 --> 44:01.291
one of the delegates...

44:01.291 --> 44:03.917
Lieutenant, this couldn't

44:01.291 --> 44:03.917
have waited a moment?

44:03.917 --> 44:05.834
It's good to see you, sir.

44:05.834 --> 44:09.583
The problem is is that one of

44:05.834 --> 44:09.583
the cooks has just been asked

44:09.583 --> 44:11.500
to broil reptile

44:09.583 --> 44:11.500
for the Anticans

44:11.500 --> 44:14.000
and it looks like

44:11.500 --> 44:14.000
the Selay delegate.

44:15.583 --> 44:20.500
Riker, what with the

44:15.583 --> 44:20.500
peace delegates and all,

44:20.500 --> 44:22.959
I think I do

44:20.500 --> 44:22.959
need a rest.

44:22.959 --> 44:25.166
Take charge,

44:22.959 --> 44:25.166
Number One.
