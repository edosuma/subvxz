WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.503
Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.

00:03.586 --> 00:05.755
I have this thing,
and I have to ballroom dance.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.299
I could teach you.
- You know how to waltz?

00:08.383 --> 00:12.595
Okay, dog whisperer, ballroom champ.
What other secrets are you hiding?

00:12.679 --> 00:16.433
Brooke's a fancy woman.
She's gonna expect a dip, Scott.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.475
Go big or go home.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.354
Scott, come join me later. We'll have
a scotch and cigar with Buzz Aldrin.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.106
Those police files that you asked for,

00:23.189 --> 00:25.525
Mayor Sutton came to my office,
asked for the exact same ones.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.110
Should we be looking into David?

00:27.193 --> 00:28.653
He was Dad's best friend.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.823
Your dad was always riled
about developers ruining the town.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.950
Just before he passed,
he called me, wanted to meet.

00:34.034 --> 00:34.868
About what?

00:34.951 --> 00:37.120
He died before I had the chance
to talk with him.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.163
What did you find?

00:38.246 --> 00:40.206
That road where he had the heart attack…

00:40.290 --> 00:41.875
Your father was watching something.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.173
Welcome to
the Cypress Beach Guacamole Festival.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.344
-Hey, how are you, bud?
-I'm good.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.849
Oh!

00:59.392 --> 01:00.685
-Hey, this is Brooke.
-Hi!

01:02.312 --> 01:03.313
We have to--

01:04.314 --> 01:06.274
-Hey!
-Hey.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.192
It's pretty good.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.235
Yeah?
-Come on.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.945
I can't. Oh, yeah.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.655
Flips.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.698
You won all of 'em.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.369
Did you see that?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.626
I thought that I had it.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.254
- Ooh! Ooh!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.006
Ringtoss harder this year?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.424
I don't need your negativity.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.345
-Oh. Mayor Sutton, this is Brooke.
-Hi.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.555
Call me David.
And you're Scott's girlfriend?

01:38.139 --> 01:41.017
I'm not sure we're officially…

01:41.101 --> 01:43.144
Uh-oh. This is getting guac-ward.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.983
No, it's okay. Yes, I am his girlfriend.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.611
So how long have you been the mayor?

01:51.694 --> 01:53.863
Seems like forever. Ten years.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.198
Ten years. Wow.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.449
Before that I was a cop.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.827
And my old partner
was the father of these two rascals.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.203
Well, three rascals.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.373
Sounds like Scott's dad
was a pretty big deal around here.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.458
He was the town hero. No doubt about it.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.752
This whole festival
is dedicated to him this year.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.629
Mayor Sutton,
please report to the tug-of-war.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.423
Oh, I should go. You two have fun.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.467
-Rock out with your guac out.
-Yeah!

02:15.677 --> 02:18.138
You guys know everyone.
It's kind of like dating royalty.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.683
Technically, 'cause you're my brother,
and I was Guacamole Princess, so…

02:21.766 --> 02:22.767
It's true. Yes.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.437
The year I was nominated for
Guacamole Prince, I lost to Laura's ex.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.689
I did it, Dad!

02:27.772 --> 02:29.774
Oof. That is the pits.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.569
-Yeah.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.195
-Mom, I did it!
-What?

02:34.279 --> 02:37.448
-I won the guacamole-eating contest!
-Yes!

02:37.532 --> 02:39.409
I ate four pounds!

02:39.492 --> 02:41.619
-Yeah.
-Well, it is a family of champs, kiddo.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.455
Come on, let's go say bye to your grandma
at the puppy booth, okay?

02:44.539 --> 02:45.498
Okay.
-See you later.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.791
Bye.

02:47.458 --> 02:51.421
I have to admit, when you invited me,
I wasn't sure what to think,

02:51.504 --> 02:54.883
but I am impressed, Scott Turner.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.976
Hey, Matthew, don't forget your ribbon!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.563
I'm kinda worried about Hooch.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.649
I think all that guacamole he ate
gave him gas.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.317
You think? I know.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.319
You know, I've gotta say,

03:56.402 --> 03:59.280
I am pleasantly surprised
that Brooke did so well.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.409
I didn't ever think that
I would see you at another GuacFest.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.245
What's that supposed to mean?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.622
Just that you skipped a few Fests,
you know?

04:07.705 --> 04:09.415
Dad would be happy you're back.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.335
-Hey, speaking of Dad,

04:12.418 --> 04:14.963
were you able to look at David's notes
on Dad's case?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.924
We have got the mayor on our side.
That's gotta be good for something.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.260
We're pretty much right back
to where we started.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.346
I mean, we know Dad
was watching something on Valley Road,

04:23.429 --> 04:25.014
but it could've been anything.

04:25.098 --> 04:25.932
I'll ask around.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.977
What? I was the Guacamole Princess, okay?

04:29.060 --> 04:32.605
If there's one thing I know that I can do,
it's get information from my subjects.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.401
Four pounds of guacamole.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.613
So, the champ fertilized the roses
a bit on his way in.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.073
He might need something for his tummy.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.534
I think they both do.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.164
I wanted to thank you for spending
the whole day with my family.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.376
Don't be silly. I should thank you.
I loved your family.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.920
You guys are like the Kennedys
of Cypress Beach,

04:56.004 --> 04:58.089
I mean, if the Kennedys had a gassy dog.

04:58.172 --> 05:02.176
Actually, speaking of family,
I wanted to talk to you about something.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.429
Are you a fan of Senator Helen Pine?

05:04.512 --> 05:08.141
Um, Safe Schools Act. What?
Helped build the new civic center, right?

05:08.224 --> 05:10.435
Well, Daddy has a friend
from Princeton in the FBI,

05:10.518 --> 05:12.854
and there have been some threats
against the senator.

05:12.937 --> 05:13.813
Really?

05:13.896 --> 05:15.940
And they're bringing in
the Marshals for protection.

05:16.024 --> 05:20.194
And I told him that I know
the perfect person to be in charge.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.821
Oh, yeah, right.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.032
A case like that,
they would never give it to me.

05:24.115 --> 05:28.077
Maybe, maybe not.
My father put in a good word for you.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.873
I-- You know,
you kinda have to earn the big cases.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.625
You did earn it.
You impressed my dad at the charity ball.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.379
So you want me
to literally waltz into the case?

05:38.463 --> 05:41.341
This is your chance to show the chief
what you can do.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.925
Just promise you'll ask.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.386
All right. Fine.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.514
Okay, buddy. We got this.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.266
Just gonna make our case, right?

05:50.350 --> 05:54.645
I'm ready to be deputy in charge,
and you can be dog in charge. Right?

05:54.729 --> 05:57.231
Do good, and it's gonna be Treat City,
all right?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.400
All right, come on.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.238
Uh, Chief? Do you have a second?

06:04.322 --> 06:05.281
Come on in.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.575
So I heard about the assignment
protecting Senator Pine,

06:07.658 --> 06:09.285
and I would like to be considered for DIC.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.496
Now, I know it's unusual for a new deputy,

06:11.579 --> 06:15.166
but I've put together a PowerPoint
as to why I think I'd be a good choice.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.543
Yeah. It's the wrong PowerPoint.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.921
Just try to wipe that image
from your mind.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.882
Here we go.
Now, if we look at the pie graph,

06:22.965 --> 06:25.176
I've actually evaluated
my protection cases,

06:25.259 --> 06:27.762
and if you include court duty,
I've got over 200 hours of--

06:27.845 --> 06:29.263
Turner, enough.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.140
I got a call from the marshal.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.769
I guess somebody spoke to somebody.
Anyway, the job's yours.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.146
It is? That's fantastic.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.357
Well, it's not usually
how we do things around here,

06:39.440 --> 06:41.275
going over people's heads,
but he's the boss.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.986
I won't let you down.
I'll put together a team right now.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.363
Good. Briefing's at 11:00.

06:45.947 --> 06:46.948
Thank you.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.366
-Oh, and, Turner.
-Yeah.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.618
Good luck with those fitness goals.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.586
X. X, guess what?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.464
Banana Republic
is having a sale on chinos?

07:03.548 --> 07:06.259
Yeah, how'd you know?
You banana republican?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.055
Thanks.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.850
Hey, I just got my first
deputy-in-charge assignment.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.436
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna be protecting Senator Pine.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.104
Brooke's dad talked to the marshal,

07:18.187 --> 07:21.858
who called the chief personally,
and I got the job.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.609
I thought you could be my number two.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.404
That's okay. Good luck though.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.781
What? What do-- What do you mean?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.075
I don't like to drop in
on someone else's wave.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.077
No, no, no. Nah, it's not--

07:33.161 --> 07:36.497
See, you wouldn't be dropping in
because this is my wave,

07:36.581 --> 07:39.000
but we're on the same board
and it's pumping.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.210
Have fun with it.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.421
See you, Hooch.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.049
What was that about?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.259
I'd love to.

07:48.342 --> 07:52.889
But I have mileage reports to do,
and so I have to organize rec-- receipts.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.058
That's the thing about receipts, right?
They don't organize themselves.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.186
I've always said that.
You can't ask a receipt…

07:58.269 --> 08:02.273
I wish I could, but my computer's
been acting up, and I'm updating it.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.442
I just gotta make sure nothing goes wrong.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.402
Can't be too careful.

08:08.196 --> 08:12.700
I would, but I think that
I'm allergic to Hooch actually, so…

08:14.076 --> 08:15.453
You have a German shepherd. I…

08:18.789 --> 08:22.710
I-I-I don't get it. Do I smell?
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.712
Well, I'll tell you what's going on.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.716
What's going on is you went to the chief
and snaked a case.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.800
You jumped the line.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.428
I didn't jump the…
The case was given to me.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.847
Would have been somebody else's case
before that call.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.058
You're supposed to get cases
when you're ready.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.809
I'm ready. Hooch is ready.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.311
-You ready, Hooch? We're ready.
-

08:40.394 --> 08:43.856
G-- Jess, please. I-I-I need a team.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.571
Fine. I know a few deputies

08:50.655 --> 08:54.033
that haven't been able to get off
court duty, so they'll take anything.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.493
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.579
-Wait. Why can't they get off court duty?
-Are you seriously being picky right now?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.414
-No.
-You're the one who jumped the line.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.668
-Go to your briefing.
-Thanks.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.086
Mm-hmm.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.132
Senator Pine, I would like you
to meet Deputy Scott Turner.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.009
He'll be in charge
of your protection detail.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.763
Wonderful to meet you.
My chief of staff, Alex.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.139
We've heard a lot of great things
about you.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.517
You have friends in high places,
Deputy Turner.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.519
Any relation to the police officer

09:21.602 --> 09:25.231
who broke that big money laundering
operation back in, what, '89?

09:25.314 --> 09:26.816
Actually, he was my father.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.903
Wonderful. Great man. Real hero.
Thank you for being here.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.196
Well, I'll get right to it.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.491
The senator's office
has received several threats recently.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.494
"I'm coming for you. I'm gonna
wipe you from the face of the Earth."

09:38.578 --> 09:40.329
This looks bad.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.166
She started receiving these threats
after her speech on space exploration.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.254
Well, my team will be with you 24/7.
As deputy in charge, I will--

09:48.337 --> 09:50.256
-Oh!
-Gosh. I'm so sorry.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.925
-Come here, Hooch. Come here, buddy.
-Thank you.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.011
Sorry. He likes pastries.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.221
-Deputy Turner's part of our K-9 unit.
- I'm sorry.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.931
Is this some kind of joke?

09:59.015 --> 10:02.393
We're gonna be doing events
and taking photos with that?

10:02.476 --> 10:05.688
I assure you,
he is a highly trained protection dog.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.982
He won't be a problem. Will he?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.066
Course not.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.615
Hey, Jess. What's going on?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.534
Hey. Okay, so just calling
to give you a heads-up.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.286
Scott's on his way over.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.496
Why are you warning me?

10:22.580 --> 10:26.042
Maybe 'cause the last time he came over,
you agreed to dog-sit for him

10:26.125 --> 10:27.960
while he went out
with another woman, girl.

10:28.044 --> 10:32.048
No, 'cause what happened was
that was an accident. I accidentally--

10:32.131 --> 10:34.050
I just kind of offered without thinking.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.135
Which is exactly why
I'm calling to tell you

10:36.218 --> 10:38.971
to think about not doing that this time.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.182
Do you think I should tell him how I feel?

10:41.265 --> 10:43.768
What? No. No. No, no, no, no.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.937
I've heard you talk about how you feel,
and you can't even make sentences.

10:47.021 --> 10:51.400
Full sentences, maybe,
but half sentences, I am rocking.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.778
And that's the kind of thing
that'll make a guy's head explode.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.197
So, trust me. You just need to chill.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.825
How do I chill, Jess? I'm not a chiller.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.202
I don't know how to chill.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.454
I'm not good at chilling.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.917
Just breathe. You know? Little whoosah.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.001
Yeah.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.129
Keep your mouth closed.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.924
A little smile at the edges.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.968
Just relax your face.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.809
Okay, whatever you're doing right now,
it doesn't sound good.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.727
-Are you okay?
-I know!

11:27.395 --> 11:28.437
Oh!

11:28.521 --> 11:30.898
Oh, my gosh! He's here.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.943
Just stick-- stick to talking about dogs.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.569
-Okay.
-Just stick to dogs.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.779
Stick to dogs.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.657
And let your body language
speak for you, you know?

11:39.740 --> 11:43.369
Body language. Okay. I got this.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.995
You gotta chill, okay?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.790
Chill. Okay, yeah.
I got this.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.378
Yeah, so, you know,
it's protecting the senator.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.796
-It's kind of a big deal.
-Yes.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
I'll be attending rallies,
watching for threats,

11:56.173 --> 12:00.636
but I don't know what to do about Hooch,
other than keeping him away from pastries.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.433
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.727
Just chillin', you know?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.272
-Like Bob Dylan, the singer.
-Great.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.109
Um, so, you know, anyway,
this is just my first assignment as DIC,

12:15.192 --> 12:16.944
and it just-- It has to go well.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.698
So, main thing is make sure Hooch
has a good view of the crowd, you know?

12:20.781 --> 12:23.826
And remember, if he responds to someone,

12:23.909 --> 12:27.163
he's good at sensing emotions,
not interpreting them.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.458
-I don't follow.
-Say there's two people.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.169
Hooch would be able to tell
if they liked each other,

12:33.252 --> 12:36.338
but he wouldn't be able to tell
if it was like a crush or…

12:37.381 --> 12:38.382
just friends.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.969
-Nope, that's a terrible example.
-Okay.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.597
Think of it this way.
If Hooch spots somebody angry,

12:44.680 --> 12:48.559
he's not gonna be able to tell
if it's a protestor or a assassin.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.853
-That's your job.
-That makes sense.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.023
That's good. So--

12:55.191 --> 12:56.150
Sorry.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.485
No worries.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.070
-It's okay.
-One second. Sorry.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.363
Hey, sweetie.

13:01.447 --> 13:05.284
No, no, no. I'm just at the dog place
getting some pointers for the big job.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.869
Can I call you back?

13:07.703 --> 13:10.039
Okay. All right. Thanks. Bye.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.333
Sorry.

13:12.416 --> 13:17.004
-I gotta go do something actually.
-Oh. Is there another time?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.425
-Yeah, I gotta do it now, like, now.
-Oh.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.470
-I'm busy doing my thing. Good luck.
-Okay.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.806
Guess we're gonna have to
figure this out ourselves.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.942
Hi, I'm Scott Turner, DIC on this job.
You probably know that.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.401
Thank you all for being here.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.489
Jessica recommended all of you…
very highly.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.784
-Uh, yeah, so it's Natalia, Omar, Craig.
-Yes, sir.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.495
-Scott's fine.
-Yeah. Yeah.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.414
Okay. I know this is
your first street assignment,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.375
and we're about to take our places
in a minute.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.252
Just wanna make sure everyone has a radio.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.128
-I got spare batteries if anyone needs it.
-Great.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.714
Also burner phones, gum, tool kit,
emergency fire starters--

14:00.798 --> 14:03.133
emergency fire starters
'cause those emergency fire starters--

14:03.217 --> 14:04.760
-So we're prepared.
-Yeah.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.845
Thank you, Omar.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.013
This is really straightforward.
I'm gonna be on stage.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.808
-Each of you, take a zone.
-Should we code name the zones?

14:11.475 --> 14:15.396
It's an extra layer of security
in case communications are compromised.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.694
Uh, it's a good thought.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.196
The person we're looking for though,
they handwrite their letters,

14:24.280 --> 14:27.408
so I just don't think it's the kinda guy
who hacks a comm system.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.452
You saying that to throw him off the plan
in case he's listening?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.705
No. I'm-- I'm just saying it.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.081
Gotcha.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.585
Great, guys. Let's take our places.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.628
-Yeah.
-Please don't salute me.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.339
Yes, sir.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.842
Come on, bud.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.387
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not
seriously having the dog on stage.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.347
Yes. It's important for my K-9 unit

14:50.431 --> 14:53.017
to monitor the crowd
so he can observe all possible threats.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.936
But it was licking the senator.
It drools everywhere.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.688
Hooch is going through a wet phase,

14:57.771 --> 15:00.816
but I assure you,
he's great at spotting threats.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.110
It's all right, Alex.
Let the man do his job.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.862
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.655
-Okay?
-Okay.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.826
Just keep him out of the way.
And keep the senator safe.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.912
-I don't see this thing helping much.
-Uh-huh.

15:17.499 --> 15:21.795
And that's why I fight for the children
of our great state,

15:21.879 --> 15:25.966
so they have everything they need
to achieve their dreams.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.719
I care for all our kids

15:28.802 --> 15:32.389
the way I care for my own grandson, Miles,

15:32.473 --> 15:34.558
who's here with us today.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.559
Come on.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.731
Natalia, right side. Eyes on crowd.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.198
Down in front, Omar.
Blue hat, windbreaker. Watch his hands.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.624
-What is it, boy? You see something?

16:08.759 --> 16:10.511
Hooch, no.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.430
-Quiet.
-

16:13.514 --> 16:16.183
- Sing it, puppy!

16:16.266 --> 16:17.184
Shh. Quiet.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.061
Yeah, you go, doggy!

16:19.144 --> 16:21.730
Hooch, no. Quiet, no.
-

16:21.814 --> 16:22.773
Hooch, no.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.650
-

16:27.194 --> 16:29.279
- Sing it, puppy!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.781
You go, doggy!

16:30.864 --> 16:34.451
As you probably noticed,
we have a surprise guest.

16:34.535 --> 16:41.208
Please, let me introduce you
to Deputy Scott Turner

16:41.291 --> 16:45.754
and our number one dog supporter, Pooch!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.840
It's Hooch.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.261
Yeah, Pooch!

16:52.344 --> 16:54.680
Extra guac, please.
- Come on over. Wanna give it a try?

16:54.763 --> 16:58.851
So, you know that area out by Valley Road?
I've been trying to find out about it.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.855
I heard there could be some, you know,
criminal activity out there.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.106
And you come to see me?

17:04.189 --> 17:08.068
Of course. You stole the Driver's Ed car
in high school and drove it to Santa Cruz.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.695
You were like the number one criminal.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.573
You thought I was number one?
You're not just saying that?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.283
Might as well learn from the best, right?

17:14.366 --> 17:17.995
-So, about that road. Anything?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.539
You remember Travis Hawkins?

17:20.622 --> 17:23.792
Yeah, Travis. He had
a Eater of Souls tattooed on his neck.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.627
Yeah. Anyway, me and him,

17:25.711 --> 17:28.964
we broke into this garage out there once
a while back.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.635
There's not much out there though.
Old warehouse ways off the road a bit.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.180
But other than that, not much…

17:36.263 --> 17:39.141
-The warehouse. Tell me more about that.
-I, uh, gotta go.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.352
Wait. I have another question!

17:42.978 --> 17:44.313
What the--

17:45.689 --> 17:48.942
Grady? What are you doing?
I'm trying to investigate here.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.029
Yeah. Yeah. About that. Can we talk?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.240
I know you're all excited
about your dad's case,

17:55.324 --> 17:56.992
but you're talking to guys like Murph?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.786
I've arrested that dude, like, 20 times.

17:59.369 --> 18:03.290
I thought this would be one of those
things, you get all excited, and then--

18:03.373 --> 18:06.210
-Then I give up, is that it?
-You did bail on the vet tech exam.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.545
-I'm still studying for it.
-Selling those organic lip balms.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.506
The lip balm market in Cypress Beach
is totally saturated.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.800
And those juice cleanses
where you get friends to buy them.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.260
-They try to sell them back to you.
-This is-- No. This is different.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.763
I'm not gonna stand here
and justify myself to you

18:17.846 --> 18:20.182
in front of a stupid fried avocado stand.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.731
Uh, she didn't mean that.
Fried avocados rule.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.110
I'd have one, but I got my Invisalign.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.697
So, it went well?
-Yeah. You know what?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.407
It went surprisingly great.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.744
Look, the team's a little green,
but there were no incidents.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.412
And Hooch? I know you were worried.

18:42.496 --> 18:47.251
I can't say he was a perfect guard dog,
but he was kinda the hit of the rally.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.170
See? What did I tell you?
You were born for this.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.214
You are crushing it,
and all those doubters

18:52.297 --> 18:54.633
are gonna eat your dust
when you leave them behind.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.052
Well, it's not really about dust-eating.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.346
A little dust-eating. A little bit.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.266
Listen, I'm just pulling up
to the senator's house,

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
so can I check back in later?

19:03.976 --> 19:04.852
Kiss.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.441
-

19:13.277 --> 19:17.573
-Evening, sir. Perimeter secure.
-That's great, Craig. At ease.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.783
This is me at ease.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.327
-Omar's grabbing new flashlights.
-Great.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.581
I've worked out the best places to stand
guard for interlocking fields of fire.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.083
It's a good thought. I'm gonna go inside
and check on the senator.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.711
And then when I get back,
we'll work on the fields of fire.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.171
Okay? Great.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.256
-I'll keep strategizing.
-Great.

19:34.756 --> 19:38.010
-You don't have to salute me, Craig.
-Yes, sir!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.345
- Right in here.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.347
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.853
Oh! I didn't realize you were there.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.063
Aren't the deputies out front?

19:50.147 --> 19:53.192
Yes, ma'am. We'll be out there all night.
Just wanted to check on you.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.111
I appreciate the extra protection.
Thank you.

19:56.195 --> 20:00.365
So how do you know Martin Mailer?
He spoke very highly of you.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.659
I actually don't know him well.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.496
He's my girlfriend's dad.
She really wanted him to call you.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.789
I know how that goes.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.627
Lord knows I wouldn't be a senator
if it weren't for my late husband.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.711
God rest him.

20:12.794 --> 20:16.006
Well, speaking of rest,
it's been a long day.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.551
-Hooch.
-Howling again?

20:20.135 --> 20:23.222
I thought he did that
because of Miles' singing.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.390
So did I. What is it, Hooch?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.684
Is someone there?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.855
I should go check outside.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.815
-I'm sure it's nothing.
-Ma'am, stay here.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.485
Hooch, come on. Come on.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.487
-Hooch. Okay, fine.
-

20:38.570 --> 20:39.696
I'll be right back.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.963
Stop! US Marshals!

21:05.806 --> 21:08.517
Unidentified suspect fleeing south
from the rear of the home.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.271
Male. Dark hair. Dark clothing.
In pursuit. Requesting backup.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.397
Coming to you.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.633
-Where's the suspect? Did they get away?
-

21:41.717 --> 21:44.386
-You all right, sir?
-I'm fine. Fine.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.306
Suspect's gone. I'll call it in.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.601
Think I broke my nose. Did we get him?

21:52.269 --> 21:53.270
Ooh.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.440
Oh, geez.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.570
Unfortunately,
I was unable to get the license plate

22:01.653 --> 22:03.447
before the suspect escaped in their car.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.992
Is this after Deputy Herbert
drove his car into a ditch?

22:07.075 --> 22:10.954
Yes, but i-it wasn't really his fault.
I-I-I ran onto the road.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.084
Well, at least you scared the bad guy off.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.879
Yes. And moving forward,
we're gonna be tightening up security.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.882
Turner, this guy has escalated
from sending threats

22:21.965 --> 22:23.842
to showing up at the senator's house.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.594
Are you gonna be able to handle this?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.347
I take this responsibility
very seriously, sir.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.431
You better.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.891
Because we've got a psycho out there,

22:30.974 --> 22:34.102
and I need to know that we're not gonna
have a senator die on our watch.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.063
You have my word, sir. I'm on it.

22:36.146 --> 22:40.650
We are totally focused, 1,000% dedicated
to protecting the senator and catching--

22:42.110 --> 22:44.654
Is he eating
my Distinguished Service award?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.282
No. See. It's-- It's fine.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.586
Hey. Check out Mr. Connections over there.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.806
I get it, okay? Everyone's
annoyed at me for jumping the line.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.309
But the fact is, however I got the job,
as deputy in charge,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.144
I'm the one responsible, right?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.062
I am.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.856
There's no "I" in Marshals.

23:20.941 --> 23:21.942
Okay.

23:22.567 --> 23:26.655
Yeah. Well, to be fair though,
there is an "I" in deputy in charge.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.616
First letter of the word "in," so…

23:29.699 --> 23:31.284
You're quite a talented speller.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.330
I don't have time for your mind games.
I have a senator to protect.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.214
Number 48.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.590
That's me.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.925
Laura. Hey.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.010
Hi, Todd. How's it going?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.680
I'm good. How's GuacFest treating ya?

23:51.763 --> 23:54.599
Matthew won the ten-and-under
guacamole-eating contest.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
But really, I couldn't be prouder.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.437
I'm hoping you can help me with something.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.941
I'm looking for property records
on a warehouse out on Valley Road.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.735
It's related to an investigation
my dad was doing.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.573
An investigation? That's exciting.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.909
I'll, uh, see what I have. Be right back.

24:12.993 --> 24:13.994
Thank you.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.081
Oh. Ebony. Hi.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.459
-Hey, Laura. Hey.
-How's the baby?

24:20.542 --> 24:22.419
Well, do you have time for the truth?

24:22.502 --> 24:23.670
Uh…

24:23.753 --> 24:26.131
Oh, well, then he's an absolute angel.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.508
Oh, that's great. They grow up so fast.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.929
So, bad news.
Looks like that record was misplaced.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.639
Looked everywhere for it,
but I can't find it.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.475
These kind of things,
nothing can be done, so…

24:36.558 --> 24:38.977
But I came all the way down here.
Do you mind looking again?

24:39.060 --> 24:43.690
I would, but, uh…
it's, uh… my lunch break.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.859
So, good to see you.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.570
It's 10:30 in the morning. Todd?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.324
So I'll be over here with my team
monitoring the entrances.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.659
Entrances? What do you mean?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.578
Well, at this point
the threat level is elevated.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.914
But someone tried to gain access
to the senator's home.

24:58.997 --> 25:03.001
No. You can protect the senator best
by her side on stage.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.546
Look. The dog was a huge hit
with the local news last night.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.340
Pooch was on every station.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.342
It's Hooch, actually.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.136
Actually,
the media consultant likes Pooch better.

25:13.220 --> 25:17.516
Hooch, it reminds people of alcohol
and big liquor sponsors, our opponent.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.894
Anyway, we need it on stage howling
during the photo op

25:20.977 --> 25:22.145
with the local business leaders,

25:22.229 --> 25:24.898
preferably right after we announce
the gold level donors.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.025
-I can't actually control--
-Deputy, Deputy.

25:27.108 --> 25:30.695
Just make it happen. Okay?
Now get up there. We're about to start.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.324
Come on, Hooch.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.327
-All right, is everybody in place?
- Yes, sir.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.829
Got an action plan for multiple scenarios.

25:39.913 --> 25:43.500
Let's stick with the "look for bad guy
coming through the door" scenario for now.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.043
The threat level's a lot higher today.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.922
Omar? Omar.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.715
Uh, sorry, sir.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.218
In position.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.762
-Omar, do you have two Tasers?
-Three.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.347
I have one strapped to my ankle.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.599
Let's just keep a hand free
for the radio, okay?

25:59.683 --> 26:02.018
-Natalia?
- Fox Den sector secured.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.144
Copy.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.815
Good afternoon, everyone,
and thank you for coming.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.733
Before we get started,

26:08.817 --> 26:11.278
I wanted to introduce
one of my newest supporters.

26:11.361 --> 26:15.115
You may have seen him
on the news the other day. Pooch.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.450
Aw!
- Go, Pooch!

26:17.534 --> 26:20.662
Pooch is like my hometown
of San Francisco.

26:20.745 --> 26:25.250
A little rough around the edges,
but powerful and…

26:26.418 --> 26:28.003
dripping with potential.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.301
-The great people of California--
-

26:37.596 --> 26:39.723
Hey. Not now. Wait.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.308
Hooch. No.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.693
Caucasian male. Overcoat right side.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.986
-We need to cut him off.
- On it.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.491
Ma'am, you need to move now.
Get her upstairs.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.285
-Hooch! Hooch. Come on.
-

27:00.368 --> 27:01.995
US Marshals. Coming through.

27:02.078 --> 27:02.954
Hooch!

27:03.038 --> 27:04.706
-Move, move, move.
-Come on.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.507
Stop! US Marshals!

27:22.098 --> 27:24.100
Coming through! Over here.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.732
Out of the way.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.193
Move, move, move.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.321
-

27:39.616 --> 27:41.201
Stop. US Marshals!

27:41.284 --> 27:42.744
Whoa!

27:44.371 --> 27:46.414
Don't let him get away.
-Geez.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.671
We got him. We got him. Oh!

27:54.172 --> 27:57.217
Deputy down! It's a bloodbath!

27:57.300 --> 27:58.677
It's soup, Natalia.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.817
Give me your hands.
Keep your hands behind your back.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.693
Don't move.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.952
Sir… You all right, sir?

28:24.035 --> 28:26.621
It's fine, guys. We got him.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.790
We got him. Good job.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.043
Guys, I think
I wanna go back to court duty.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.009
Senator, how will today's events
affect your campaign?

28:40.093 --> 28:44.931
I wanna thank the great US Deputy Marshals
who protected me.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.850
They're the heroes today.

28:46.933 --> 28:49.018
Wow. How does that make you feel?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.020
Oh. Uh, just doing my job.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.399
I should point out that
the senator's opponent doesn't have a dog.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.568
I mean, is she anti-dog?
Does she even have a pet?

28:56.651 --> 28:58.695
The people of California need to know.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.821
Senator, we want--

28:59.904 --> 29:02.407
Scott, look at you. That's amazing.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.076
-You're right there with the senator.
-Yeah, it went pretty well.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.912
Are you kidding? Your first time as DIC,
and you caught an assassin.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.497
You saved a senator's life.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.999
I-I-I don't know about that.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.295
You know, it was weird, actually.

29:15.378 --> 29:18.339
He didn't seem to have a weapon.
Just, like, a stick.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.841
A stick is a weapon.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.762
Also, the guy escaped four highly trained
deputies at the senator's house.

29:23.845 --> 29:27.390
Yeah, I don't know how highly trained.
One of them drove into a ditch.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.518
Stop being so humble, Scott.
This is your moment.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.566
Oh, my gosh. Daddy's watching
the news right now. He's so happy.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.401
Yeah? What'd he say?

29:38.485 --> 29:39.819
Check it out.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.448
You're trending on Twitter
as hashtag Pooch.

29:43.531 --> 29:46.409
-Really? I'm trending.
-

29:47.076 --> 29:50.413
I hope you learned a valuable lesson,
Mr. I-wanna-earn-my-cases.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.291
Nothing wrong
with working the system a bit.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.587
Wish I could see the looks on
the people's faces who doubted you now.

30:02.091 --> 30:05.720
I heard this dog is quite the hero.
Hi, Pooch.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.930
It's Hooch, actually.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.849
Exactly. And who's the clever one?

30:10.433 --> 30:14.354
Um… It's-- Again, it's a team effort.
We're all clever.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.939
You're all clever.
-Hey, baby.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.149
-I heard he sounded the alarm today.
-I brought you dinner.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.609
Yes, ma'am.
-You okay?

30:19.692 --> 30:22.445
Yes, it's just this case
Scott's working on.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.739
We're a K-9 unit.
-And does he do any tricks?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.367
Well, what's the problem?
It looks like Scott caught the guy.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.411
Well, maybe he did. Maybe he didn't.

30:30.495 --> 30:34.165
Usually I get tingles when a case closes.
Right now, no tingles.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.752
I'm sure it's fine. You need to relax.

30:37.836 --> 30:38.920
Yeah, I know.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.840
Just hard to relax
when you know something's coming.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.592
Yeah, that and treats.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.304
What did you do to relax
when you were in the marines?

30:48.388 --> 30:49.305
Didn't.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.391
You must have done something.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.020
You know, sometimes
when I was standing post at night,

30:57.146 --> 30:58.731
I thought about you.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.777
Come on. You didn't even know me.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.822
Well, I imagined perfection…

31:07.365 --> 31:09.284
so that I'd know you when I met you.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.161
And we will keep you posted
as we learn more

31:12.245 --> 31:14.581
about the attack on Senator Pine.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.707
Back to you, Ron.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.756
And I see
you've waived your right to an attorney.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.427
Mr. Tibbs,
I need to ask you a few questions.

31:27.510 --> 31:31.472
I have nothing to hide.
I want the world to know everything.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.143
So you admit it was you who made
the threats against the senator's life?

31:35.226 --> 31:36.352
Yes.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.900
You wanna tell me what this is?

31:41.983 --> 31:44.736
It's a laser sword to battle Senator Pine

31:44.819 --> 31:47.655
to drive her from the face of the Earth
and back to the Hydrus galaxy.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.658
I've already warned her.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.577
Back up a bit.

31:52.660 --> 31:56.497
This stick wrapped in foil
is a laser sword?

31:56.581 --> 32:01.002
An Inzinium blade,
the weapon of the intergalactic warrior.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.504
Uh-huh.

32:04.797 --> 32:05.798
Uh-huh.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.885
Okay… um, tell me this.

32:08.968 --> 32:12.347
The night before last,
were you at the senator's house?

32:12.430 --> 32:14.140
I'm everywhere the senator is.

32:14.223 --> 32:18.227
I use a dimensional gateway
to move myself through time and space.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.437
I'm with her right now.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.858
Shh. She's eating a sandwich.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.527
There's no escape for her.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.115
I don't understand.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.994
You're saying there's another attacker,
this guy wasn't at the senator's house?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.830
When I asked Tibbs
what color the senator's house was,

32:37.914 --> 32:39.123
he said, "Fancy."

32:39.207 --> 32:41.668
And the suspect drove away at high speed.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.878
I don't even think
Tibbs knows how to drive a car.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.090
I'm not saying the guy's not a nutjob.
You said he confessed though.

32:47.173 --> 32:50.677
Yeah, he did. I'm just worried
we're missing something here.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.221
Look, here's the thing, Turner.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.765
The marshal is thrilled.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.892
And when the big guy's thrilled,
I'm thrilled.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.186
-Take the win.
-Yes, I'm just wondering if we should--

33:00.269 --> 33:03.106
Also, the senator's office called.
They want you at another rally.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.358
You know, have the dog howl for the crowd.

33:05.441 --> 33:09.737
He doesn't really do commands.
Plus, I don't think I can just turn it on.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.907
You better because they're gonna
give you an award, which is good,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.118
because then maybe Hooch
will leave mine alone.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.832
Okay. I'm just gonna…

33:26.629 --> 33:27.630
I'm sorry.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.717
Whatever. At least they all match now.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.678
-We done here, Turner?
-Yeah. I guess.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.767
Okay.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.977
-Mom.
-Yeah?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.770
Why are we here so early?

33:42.854 --> 33:45.481
I have to pick something up
before I drop you off at school, okay?

33:45.565 --> 33:46.858
Just sit here for a few minutes.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.528
I got a Grape-Nut in my nose
eating breakfast in the car.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.488
What? Okay. You got it out.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.032
I'll be one second.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.158
Hey, Todd.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.245
-Hey, Laura.
-I'm back about that warehouse.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.456
I need the address,
and I need to know who owns it.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.916
And don't you dare tell me
you have a breakfast break.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.003
Right, yeah, uh, the warehouse, um…

34:08.504 --> 34:12.258
Looked everywhere for it. I can't find it.
Maybe you can come back another time.

34:12.341 --> 34:16.471
Todd, I've known your girlfriend Lisa
since third grade.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.891
We back-combed each other's bangs.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.935
I got her invited
to Crystal Slipkin's 12th birthday.

34:23.770 --> 34:24.896
Taught her about second base.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.355
Mm-hmm.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.233
If you don't tell me what's going on…

34:30.943 --> 34:33.529
I will call Lisa.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.958
Grady! Grady Garland, you and I
need to have a conversation right now!

34:46.042 --> 34:49.545
Crap. Don't tell me it was my day
to take Matthew to school.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.089
No. I just left City Hall,

34:51.172 --> 34:53.633
and Todd told me
that I couldn't have records that I wanted

34:53.716 --> 34:55.968
because it was illegal file giving.

34:56.052 --> 34:59.013
You do know
that that's not a real law, right?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.556
Well, now you know.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.850
Also, how did you even find out
I was there?

35:04.060 --> 35:07.438
I might have followed you… a little.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.774
You followed me?
Do you know how creepy that is?

35:09.857 --> 35:12.652
I'm sorry. I should've told you.
But I knew you'd be mad.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.988
Laura,
you're going around talking to criminals.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.533
I mean, I know we're divorced,
but you're my kid's mom.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.617
Is this the '50s?

35:19.700 --> 35:22.829
Did the greasers crash the sock hop, and
I need a big, strong man to protect me?

35:22.912 --> 35:25.957
No, it's not like that. Come on,
you're the strongest person I know.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.378
I guess I'm just-- I'm scared for you,

35:31.629 --> 35:34.966
and… kind of for me too.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.678
Grady, it's like I said before.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.056
This case is all I have left of my dad.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.433
And he always told me
that I could do big things.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.563
And for the first time in my life,
I feel like I actually believe him,

35:48.646 --> 35:49.939
that he could be right.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.359
What?
Come on, you've done hella great things.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.819
You're Matthew's mom.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.697
You won that over-30 moms
Fortnite tournament.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.115
Laura, you're amazing.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.742
You don't have to prove anything.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.749
Fine. I'll call Todd.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.752
I'll tell him to give you whatever
you want, and I'll stay out of it.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.754
Please be careful.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.007
Thank you.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.308
Scott is here.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.227
-He's asking for you.
-Oh.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.022
Um, can you tell him I'm busy?

36:31.105 --> 36:34.150
But you're not busy.
You're brushing Angel's hair.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.068
I know. I'm just--

36:36.152 --> 36:38.905
-I'll tell him you don't wanna see him.
-No! No.

36:38.988 --> 36:43.743
I'm just a little overwhelmed emotionally.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.620
-I'll tell him that then.
-No.

36:47.580 --> 36:51.542
I'll go. Yeah. I'll go. I'll go.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.296
-Are you gonna go?
-I'm going. Yes, I am going.

36:55.922 --> 36:59.383
Anyway, the senator's people
are asking Hooch to howl.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.930
That's weird. I don't understand.
I thought you were protecting the senator.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.724
Yeah.
Protecting her polling numbers maybe.

37:06.807 --> 37:10.811
Listen, I know it's a lot to ask,
but can you show me how?

37:15.233 --> 37:19.111
Well, it's obvious
Hooch was howling for a reason.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.197
Without knowing his feelings,
I can't really--

37:21.280 --> 37:25.201
Honestly, I just need him to howl.
I don't care about his feelings.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.663
You don't care about his feelings?

37:29.789 --> 37:30.915
You can't…

37:31.707 --> 37:33.167
Feelings are important.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.752
You can't just ignore them.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.838
You have to let him have his feelings.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.300
He can't bottle them up. Doesn't work.
He needs to get them out.

37:41.884 --> 37:45.513
He should,
no matter what anybody else says.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.561
Erica, you're not really talking
about Hooch anymore, are you?

37:56.857 --> 37:57.900
Maybe not.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.696
-Maybe I'm talking about--
-About me.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.155
That's it, right?

38:03.239 --> 38:06.701
About my feelings.
About Brooke's dad getting me this job.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.411
About being deputy in charge.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.913
And about feeling
like this case is just wrong.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.833
I mean, I can't ignore those feelings!

38:17.545 --> 38:20.172
Oh, you're amazing. Thank you.

38:21.048 --> 38:22.133
-I gotta go. Okay.
-Okay.

38:23.759 --> 38:24.885
Let's go. Let's go.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.972
I was talking about me.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.224
You got that, right?

38:31.684 --> 38:33.185
Mmm. Okay.

38:35.479 --> 38:39.025
Yes, I figure we go in there,
we serve the warrant, and we pick him up.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.109
Okay.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.902
Are you busy, or…

38:41.986 --> 38:44.447
-No, we're just-- we're finishing up.
-Mm-hmm.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.074
Listen, I really need your help.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.452
I know I jumped the line,
and I know that was wrong.

38:49.535 --> 38:52.455
But I thought I was ready
to be deputy in charge, but I'm not ready.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.291
And everybody in this place
thinks that this case is closed,

38:55.374 --> 38:58.169
but I got this feeling, dude,
that there is something wrong.

38:58.252 --> 39:01.505
And I don't know what it is.
And now I'm kinda in over my head here.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.924
But I guess what I'm saying is I'm sorry.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.594
Also, is there any way you can help me?
'Cause I don't know what to do.

39:09.722 --> 39:10.723
You like kombucha?

39:12.850 --> 39:14.810
Okay. So the problem is

39:14.894 --> 39:17.396
I don't think it was Clarence Tibbs
at the senator's house,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.106
but I don't know who was there.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.109
All I could see was that it was
a black sedan. I didn't get the plates.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.320
Hmm. Was it a flying car?

39:24.403 --> 39:27.573
No, it-- it was a driving one.

39:27.656 --> 39:31.118
Then it had to pass through
the intersection at Park and Oaknoll.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.037
-What time did it leave exactly?
-Uh…

39:34.622 --> 39:35.915
9:42 p.m.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.709
Then the car
had to hit the traffic cam at Oaknoll

39:38.793 --> 39:42.129
at approximately 9:47 headed west.

39:42.213 --> 39:46.592
Red car. White car.
Silver car. Black sedan.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.762
And the license belongs to…

39:52.181 --> 39:54.558
-Look familiar?
-Something very weird is going on here.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.936
-That's Pine's chief of staff.
-Uh-huh.

39:57.686 --> 40:02.066
Look, I know this is a lot to ask,
but I'm working with these deputies, and--

40:02.149 --> 40:04.693
They're just so excited to be there,
but they don't know anything.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.404
-Yeah, I know the type.
-Right.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.698
I see what you did there. Uh, anyway…

40:10.282 --> 40:12.827
Any chance you'll come with me
to the senator's place?

40:14.829 --> 40:16.622
There's no "I" in Marshals.

40:18.999 --> 40:22.336
So we'll start with a cocktail party,
but then after the opening remarks,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.672
we're gonna have you do
a meet and greet with--

40:24.755 --> 40:29.176
Oh, how long will that take?
I'm feeling a little tired.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.139
I understand, Senator, but these
are the gold level donors, and we--

40:33.222 --> 40:35.850
What are you doing here?
The rally's tomorrow.

40:35.933 --> 40:36.934
Who is this?

40:37.518 --> 40:40.312
Deputy Wilson's here to help
with the follow-up investigation.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.649
What follow-up investigation?
What are you talking about?

40:43.732 --> 40:47.278
We're here to find out why you were in
the senator's backyard on Tuesday night.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.946
-Me?
-

40:49.029 --> 40:52.491
That's-- That's just ridiculous.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.869
You caught the intruder yourself
at the event--

40:54.952 --> 40:57.830
The guy I arrested was never
at the senator's house. That was you.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.499
-Alex, we should really tell them.
-

41:00.583 --> 41:02.293
-Tell me what?
-No, there's nothing to tell.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.170
We have an event
that's happening in an hour.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.796
-Can't this wait?
-Alex, please.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.923
Senator,
these men are not supposed to be here.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.469
They come barging in with accusations,
and they're disrupting a private event!

41:11.552 --> 41:13.387
-Oh, ma'am. Ma'am, ma'am.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.097
-Senator! What's happening?
-

41:15.181 --> 41:16.599
-Ma'am.
- Okay.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.559
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
What's happening?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.394
-Pulse is weak.
-She's barely breathing.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.354
-Hooch, shut up.

41:22.438 --> 41:26.066
Hooch is trying to tell you the senator's
sick. Does she have heart problems?

41:26.150 --> 41:29.487
A buddy of mine in the marines has a dog
that barks when his blood pressure drops.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.197
Yes, she has congestive heart failure.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.907
We didn't tell anyone
because of the campaign.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.492
I was at her house delivering medicine,

41:34.575 --> 41:36.660
but the dog started freaking out
and I panicked and I ran.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.121
-We need an ambulance!
-No time for an ambulance.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.124
-We gotta get her to a hospital right now.
-All right.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.543
Emergency! Get out of the way!
Go, go, go, go.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.214
-Come on, come on. You ready?
- Okay. I got you.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.590
-Keys.
-X, let's go!

41:49.673 --> 41:52.134
Senator, come on.
You gotta wake up. Come on, come on.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.686
Her pulse is dropping, X!

42:02.770 --> 42:04.230
She's gotta take one of these
or she's gonna die.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.232
Senator, you gotta wake up.
You gotta wake up.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.026
She can't take a pill if she's passed out!
X, how much longer?

42:09.109 --> 42:11.362
Not long enough.
You need to wake her up, Scott.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.656
-But how do I do that?
-You gotta shock her somehow.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.325
-Stimulate her autonomic nervous system.
-What is that?

42:16.408 --> 42:19.078
Part of the brain
that responds to pain, disgust.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.454
Pain…

42:20.538 --> 42:21.956
-Go.
-Senator, Senator.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.249
It's not working.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.584
She's dying!

42:26.752 --> 42:29.672
-

42:30.673 --> 42:32.508
Come on.
-X, disgust works?

42:32.591 --> 42:35.177
Disgust is good.
You need to shock her system.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.804
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to save her life.

42:36.887 --> 42:40.474
Is that gravy? No, no, no. This is insane.
This is very unsanitary.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.435
-Go, Hooch. Go, buddy. Go, go, go.
- Oh!

42:44.770 --> 42:45.980
Go, buddy.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.147
Ugh.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.692
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am?

42:49.775 --> 42:51.986
She's waking up. She's waking up.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.071
-She's awake.
-Dog spit.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.990
Yes, Senator. It's dog spit.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.533
-It's dog spit.
- Nice job, Hooch.

42:57.616 --> 43:00.494
Here, you need to take one of these pills.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.621
She's awake! She's awake!

43:03.706 --> 43:05.249
You okay, ma'am?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.876
Yes. Thank you.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.180
Just finished up the after-action report.
You wanna take a look?

43:20.264 --> 43:22.057
Nope. I'm sure it's perfect.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.642
Yeah, I wanted to ask you.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.894
How did you know
when you were ready to be DIC?

43:25.978 --> 43:29.023
Like, if I'm not supposed to jump the line
to be DIC till I'm ready,

43:29.106 --> 43:31.150
how do I know
when I'm at the front of the line?

43:31.775 --> 43:33.235
Well, you know, 'cause you're DIC.

43:35.029 --> 43:39.116
Right. I-- Right, I can't be DIC
till I'm at the front of the line,

43:39.199 --> 43:41.702
but I'll only know I'm at the front
of the line when I am DIC?

43:41.785 --> 43:43.537
-Exactly.
-Right, but--

43:43.621 --> 43:45.080
Turner, Wilson.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.665
The senator would like a word.

43:47.541 --> 43:51.045
I just wanted to thank you
and to apologize.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.921
I should've told you about my condition.

43:53.005 --> 43:56.800
Alex said it would hurt
my reelection chances if it came out.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.761
Dying probably wouldn't help much either.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.804
No, I suppose not.

44:00.888 --> 44:01.722
Mm-mmm.

44:01.805 --> 44:05.893
Anyway, if there's anything
I can do to repay you…

44:05.976 --> 44:07.519
Actually, there is one thing.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.647
You know that award
you were gonna give me?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.857
Do you think
you could give it to Hooch instead?

44:11.940 --> 44:14.401
He, uh, kinda has a thing for awards.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.236
It would be my pleasure.

44:16.320 --> 44:21.825
Hooch, thank you so much.
You saved my life.

44:30.709 --> 44:32.127
Hooch, dessert!

44:33.629 --> 44:36.590
To your first case as DIC.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.676
Saving a senator's life, very nice.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.471
Too bad Pine's retiring though.
She would've been great for your career.

44:42.554 --> 44:43.972
Hmm.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.058
The good news is, she's okay.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.226
Speaking of good news.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.270
You know that Mafia case
you helped me with?

44:50.354 --> 44:53.273
They want me to consult on another one.
I got word today.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.400
-Great.
-Yeah.

44:54.483 --> 44:55.609
I'll do court security again.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.821
Well, not unless you
wanna come to Boston with me.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.155
That's where the trial is.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.907
I leave tomorrow morning.

45:02.908 --> 45:05.327
Oh, wow. So you're leaving tomorrow?

45:05.411 --> 45:07.287
Be gone, like, two months tops.

45:08.747 --> 45:09.915
Oh, cool.

45:11.959 --> 45:15.170
Scott… don't worry about it.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.339
I'll be back before you know it.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.384
I'm so proud of us. We're crushing it.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.849
Get that.
I have to return some emails anyway.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.563
Yeah.

45:35.607 --> 45:38.026
Oh, hi. Hey, Laura. What's up?

45:38.110 --> 45:41.697
So you know how I said I would ask about
that road where Dad had his heart attack?

45:41.780 --> 45:42.740
Yeah?

45:42.823 --> 45:45.200
-Well, I did. And I found something.
-What?

45:45.284 --> 45:48.579
Yeah, it turns out there's this warehouse
out there owned by some trucking company.

45:48.662 --> 45:51.665
I got the address.
So we should probably check it out.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.377
I sort of promised Grady that I wouldn't.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.504
-He's worried, so…
-You know what?

45:59.256 --> 46:00.507
I'll go check it out tonight.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.759
Thank you.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.567
Okay. We'll take a quick look and leave.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.169
-What is it, boy? You smell something?

46:37.252 --> 46:40.214
-Hooch! Come back, Hooch!

46:41.632 --> 46:45.219
Hooch, we can't go inside.
-

46:46.011 --> 46:47.387
Hooch, what's wrong?

46:48.096 --> 46:50.849
-We're not supposed to be in here, Hooch.
-

47:01.276 --> 47:03.195
Hooch. Hooch.

47:04.154 --> 47:05.447
What is it, buddy?

47:05.531 --> 47:07.783
This building's empty.
You just don't like this place?

47:07.866 --> 47:09.827
-

47:33.934 --> 47:35.769
-Freeze! US Marshal!
-

47:39.356 --> 47:43.402
Dude, what the hell?
You made me swallow my Invisalign.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.362
Grady, what are you doing here?

47:46.905 --> 47:48.699
You're in a lot of trouble, man.
