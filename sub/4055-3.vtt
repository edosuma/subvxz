Extracting or viewing read-only

41:31.739 --> 41:33.275
I'm afraid I don't understand.

41:35.159 --> 41:40.950
The most common reason
for unusual synth behavior

41:41.082 --> 41:43.539
is illegal modification.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.664
No, Laura.

41:51.801 --> 41:54.634
One of the most popular mods
is to program your synth

41:54.762 --> 41:56.753
to act as if it feels pain.

made from is highly resilient

Why do you think I have
these concerns about you?

42:53.362 --> 42:57.321
By design, synthetic appliances
appear very similar to humans.

42:57.450 --> 42:59.941

especially those

43:00.078 --> 43:02.239
without a history
of prior appliance ownership,

43:02.371 --> 43:05.238
to anthropomorphize,
as you might a pet,

43:05.374 --> 43:06.955
and attribute
human characteristics

43:07.085 --> 43:07.824
