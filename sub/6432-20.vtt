WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.625
Previously
on Warehouse 13...

00:03.036 --> 00:04.230
I have cancer.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.940
Be good and quiet.
And I'll make you mortal again.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.875
You took everything from me.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.640
Now I'll take
something from you.

00:13.713 --> 00:15.078
No!

00:15.148 --> 00:17.013
Look after our son.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.614
This is the Eldunari, the
Warehouse's central nervous system.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.419
Something's tearing apart the
Warehouse from within its heart.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.094
Two Caretakers vying
for the Warehouse.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.124
Paracelsus was Caretaker.

00:30.764 --> 00:31.924
Of Warehouse 9.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.260
And as he gains strength,
I am...

00:34.734 --> 00:35.928
I will...

00:39.305 --> 00:42.638
I spoke to Mr. Kosan. Paracelsus
has to be taken alive.

00:42.942 --> 00:43.966
Alive?
Yes,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.375
in the state that
Mrs. Frederic is in,

00:45.445 --> 00:48.380
if he dies suddenly, it could
cause a rupture in her psyche.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.916
He has to be captured.
He has to be bronzed.

00:51.017 --> 00:54.111
And that's how we can transfer
the Caretakership back to her.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.279
Well how is she?

00:55.855 --> 00:57.322
Worse and worse by the hour.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.858
Dr. Abigail's with her,
but her memory's failing...

01:00.193 --> 01:01.353
She's...

01:03.229 --> 01:04.218
Fading.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.999
So then what? Paracelsus
just takes over?

01:09.102 --> 01:12.003
Claud, come on, you're the
future Caretaker, right?

01:12.338 --> 01:15.569
Feel anything about him? I
don't know, like where he is?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.967
Nada, no, I guess
I'm still in training,

01:18.044 --> 01:20.410
but I will find this guy,
that bitch put me in bronze.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.504
I have a score to settle.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.674
Well, thanks to Joshua's blood
sample, you have the chance.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.274
Yeah, how was Josh by the way?

01:25.351 --> 01:26.716
Did he faint when you
took the blood,

01:26.786 --> 01:28.720
because when it comes
to needles, he's so not butch.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.756
Yeah, no,
he was pretty queasy...

01:31.691 --> 01:33.158
Look, can we please focus

01:33.293 --> 01:36.126
on stopping Paracelsus,
getting Mrs. Frederic better.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.993
Steve, I want you
to go prep the bronzer.

01:38.064 --> 01:41.500
Pete, you and Myka go and dig through
whatever we've got on Paracelsus.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.057
Copy that.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.835
I think I should
see him, could he...

01:49.909 --> 01:52.139
Yes, yes.
That would be perfect.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.541
I will call you back.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.609
We should hang a bell
around your neck.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.016
Yeah, but then I couldn't
sneak up on you,

02:00.086 --> 02:01.951
and ask what's up
with all the hushy-hush.

02:02.021 --> 02:05.548
I made an appointment
with my oncologist. Happy?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.956
Yeah, as long as you keep it.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.119
No ditching,
no "getting busy."

02:09.195 --> 02:10.219
Yes, Dad.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.060
Oh, my God, I liked you better as
your usual annoying 12-year-old self.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.693
No, I just wanna make sure
you take care of this,

02:15.768 --> 02:17.633
we don't need
any more surprises.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.463 --> 02:44.987
Respectfully, I decline.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.157
Doctor, is there
something in my tone

02:47.233 --> 02:49.497
indicating I was
offering a suggestion?

02:49.602 --> 02:52.093
You're asking me to run,
that is not how I do things.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.637
I want the Keeper to go somewhere
where she and her secrets are secure.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.006
I made you a promise, Leena,
and I won't let you...

02:59.612 --> 03:01.876
Leena, Leena, Leena...

03:03.016 --> 03:04.711
I beg your pardon, Doctor.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.641
Irene.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.387
Come with me to the B&B.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.218
I belong with my Warehouse.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.090
But you... You carry
the most valuable information.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.662
It must be protected.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.287
She's right, Doctor.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.727
You have to go somewhere safe.

03:21.634 --> 03:22.760
How's she doing?

03:22.835 --> 03:25.030
She is fine and is
also still in the room.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.196
More or less.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.434
But I...

03:31.411 --> 03:34.039
I don't know how
much longer I have, Arthur.

03:34.113 --> 03:37.446
I'm gonna find a way to sever
Paracelsus from the Warehouse.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.275
The previous Caretaker
has precedence.

03:40.353 --> 03:43.151
Removing him is nearly impossible.
I love a good challenge.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.582
You! You have
to go right now.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.726
Irene, be careful.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.227
I've already lost enough
people I care about.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.228
I'll see what I can do.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.701
Was there something in my tone which may
have indicated I was offering a suggestion?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.236
Here, here, here!

04:09.148 --> 04:11.480
That's a lot of here's! I like that,
means there's something here.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.712
I found us a ping, or more
accurately three pings.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.084
San Francisco City Hospital.
That's one.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.918
Patients and doctors
reported seeing a, quote,

04:17.991 --> 04:19.618
"Strange and beautiful
golden light."

04:19.692 --> 04:21.023
We love strange and beautiful.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.083
Well then you'll want
to marry this.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.994
That light was emanating from a
copper bowl being carried by a man,

04:25.064 --> 04:27.999
a man fitting the description
of one Para-freaking-celsus.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.227
Why San Francisco?

04:29.369 --> 04:32.065
That's unclear, but we got the same
report from three San Fran hospitals.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.833
What about the patients
exposed to light?

04:33.906 --> 04:36.932
Are they all dead? I mean, is Paracelsus
racking up his death count like before?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.376
No deaths reported, but a
lot of patients affected.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.970
Okay, so, I guess we should...
I'll call you when I get there.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.723
Yeah, hi, what are you doing? You
have a doctor's appointment.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.523
Later this week, what am I supposed to
do till then, play fetch with Trailer?

04:56.596 --> 04:57.688
Myka...

04:57.764 --> 05:01.097
Pete, look, if anything happens
we'll be in a hospital, right?

05:03.069 --> 05:04.661
The first sign of trouble...

05:05.638 --> 05:06.627
Oh, God.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.246
Nick.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.707
Nicholas.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.312
I know your mother was the only
real parent that you ever had.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.379
I know that.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.624
I wish...
What?

05:28.127 --> 05:29.355
You wished what?

05:29.662 --> 05:32.028
Paracelsus should have
killed me, not her.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.534
Yes, he should have.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.965
We had no idea
he was a mass murderer.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.430
You never said anything.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.903
Six hundred people died
to make us immortal.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.638
So, yes, it should have been you.
We make choices in life...

05:46.713 --> 05:48.510
Save your platitudes,
I'm not 15.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.741
And I'm not your problem.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.340
That's not true.
I'm still your father...

05:51.417 --> 05:53.715
No, you're not.
I don't have a father.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.981
Fathers think of something
besides their own interest.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.886
You've never done
a thing for us,

05:57.957 --> 05:59.390
but she was there.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.324
She was the only person
in 500 years

06:01.394 --> 06:03.385
who was always there,
and now I'm completely alone.

06:13.906 --> 06:16.431
The man carried a bowl
with him, um, copper.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.472
Had an Egyptian ankh on it.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.172
He only came here,
to the terminal ward.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.939
So he sought out
dying patients.

06:23.015 --> 06:26.075
Yes, well, this
is the only wing he visited.

06:29.856 --> 06:30.845
Pete!

06:33.559 --> 06:35.186
Why didn't you do something?

06:37.029 --> 06:38.053
Pete!

06:39.165 --> 06:40.154
What?

06:44.637 --> 06:45.934
What? What? What?

06:46.005 --> 06:48.997
Dr. Trachtenberg's examined all the
patients exposed to the light.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.839
Yeah? And they're all
getting worse? No.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.778
The two patients in this room are
both in Stage IV lung cancer.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.352
This is Maggie
and this is Lucy.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.184
They're in complete remission.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.157
Oh, my God, Mykes,
he cured them.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.907
Okay, okay,
so what are we thinking?

07:28.347 --> 07:30.372
Huh? I mean, is it possible?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.213
I mean, is Paracelsus...

07:32.285 --> 07:34.879
I mean, is this part
of his plan? To cure people?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.148
He killed Charlotte.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.383
I know, I know.
Yes, yes, he did.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.327
Also a bunch of villagers
500 years ago.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.086
But, Mykes, they're cured.
I mean, what the hell?

07:46.365 --> 07:47.491
I just...

07:48.668 --> 07:51.694
So badly,
I just wanna believe...

07:51.804 --> 07:53.294
I do too. A lot.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.799
But I'm afraid we just
don't know his endgame yet.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.239
Excuse me.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.474
Maggie spoke with the man.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.847
Maggie, hi. This is Agent
Lattimer and I'm Agent Bering.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.243
Hello.
What did the man say?

08:09.922 --> 08:12.982
Well, I asked him
what he was doing.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.687
I was scared at first
but he told me not to be.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.091
He said he could see my cancer.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.862
In my eyes.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.067
And that I would be
a part of helping people.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.968
He said it would all be clear

08:28.140 --> 08:33.100
once he got to the place where
the air had yielded to stone.

08:35.081 --> 08:38.174
Before I could ask, he'd
already gone to another room.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.275
Cryptic.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.455
Great. We love cryptic.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.616
Can you describe
the copper bowl?

08:46.092 --> 08:48.424
Only that light came out of it.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.585
Golden light.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.928
It was beautiful.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.127
He took away all
that pain.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.202
Maggie, thank you.

09:04.844 --> 09:07.608
Okay, so the stone, right?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.012
It's gotta be the
Philosopher's Stone right?

09:10.182 --> 09:14.619
Right, and the air could represent
breathing or life, like a metaphor.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.051
Oh, metaphors.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.752
Worse than a cryptic.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.482
Looks like he struck again, St.
Christopher's Medical Center.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.618
Okay, we're on it.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.959
Nothing yet on where the air has
yielded to stone, I'm still searching.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.794
We think it might
be a metaphor.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.799
I'm so
tired of metaphors.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.597
Right? That's what I'm saying.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.695
I'll find something.
You find him.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.641
Steve's getting the bronzer ready for our
returning guests, but just in case...

09:36.709 --> 09:38.802
What do you think... Oh, my
God, why do you have that?

09:38.878 --> 09:40.675
Don't panic. That's what
Dr. Vanessa was going to use

09:40.746 --> 09:43.112
to transfer the Caretaker connection
from Mrs. Frederic to me.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.343
Is she that sick?
See, this resembles panicking.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.648
I won't put it on.
It's not for you.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.689
Whew! Okay, good, proceed
with the 'splaining please.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.745
Do you mind?

09:52.825 --> 09:53.849
Thank you.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.826
Ah, now I can tell you.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.865
Mrs. Frederic is getting worse,
so we've had to get inventive.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.026
This ribbon,
it disconnects Caretakers...

10:03.102 --> 10:07.129
So maybe use it to disconnect
Paracelsus, but he's not here.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.340
That's the inventive part.

10:09.742 --> 10:13.838
We are gonna send the power of this
ribbon through the Farnsworth.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.473
You can do that?

10:15.881 --> 10:19.544
The Farnsworth is more than just an
oversized iPhone, you know, yes.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.052
I'm gonna send to...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.109
Possibly.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.348
You have something to do besides
look doubtful? You know, I...

10:25.424 --> 10:26.413
Thank you.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.050
So he did the same
thing here, why?

10:29.128 --> 10:32.461
If Paracelsus needed sick people
why not get them in Istanbul?

10:32.531 --> 10:33.964
Why come all the way
to California?

10:34.033 --> 10:36.092
I don't know, nothing connects
the hospitals,

10:36.168 --> 10:37.396
two county, two private.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.268
One was elder care
and the other, ER,

10:40.339 --> 10:42.034
only the most seriously
injured and then the...

10:44.944 --> 10:46.377
Cancer ward.
Huh?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.606
You can say the word
"cancer." I know.

10:49.015 --> 10:52.007
I can say it. You know,
cancer, cancer, cancer!

10:52.952 --> 10:54.920
That was a little loud,
are you all right?

10:54.987 --> 10:57.581
Okay, look, I know that
you're worried.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.782
Whoa...
No, no, no.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.753
I am not worried, okay?

11:01.827 --> 11:04.523
I'm actually the opposite
of worried, I am un-worried

11:04.597 --> 11:06.565
because you are going to see
your doctor this week.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.192
And who told me that?
Oh, that's right, you did.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.530
Excuse me, ma'am.
You need to...

11:10.603 --> 11:11.900
Hi.
Hi.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.666
Sorry, you asked me
to review the security video

11:13.739 --> 11:15.297
and let you know which door
the gentleman left from?

11:15.374 --> 11:18.309
Mmm-hmm. We can't find any
video of him leaving.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.311
Our best guess is that the guy
is still in the building.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.142
We locked down all the exits.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.978
So I asked myself...

11:27.086 --> 11:31.580
What could possibly make a
creepy basement even creepier?

11:38.064 --> 11:39.053
I know.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.826
It could also
be a morgue. Yippee!

11:43.569 --> 11:46.834
This is the last place that
Paracelsus was spotted, so...

11:46.972 --> 11:48.166
Leave me alone.

11:48.407 --> 11:52.241
All right, all right, all right
you big ancient freak, give it up.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.238
You're done here.

11:54.313 --> 11:58.113
I'm healing. Is
that a crime in this century?

11:59.885 --> 12:03.753
No, but killing Charlotte and
almost killing Claudia was.

12:03.823 --> 12:07.190
Whatever it is that
you're planning...

12:07.359 --> 12:10.294
I'm planning
scientific progress.

12:10.529 --> 12:11.894
Okay, fine.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.490
Fine, explain it to us then.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.662
You really
wouldn't understand.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.632
Oh! No, no, no.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.531
We love it when air
yields to stone.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.302
Myka, icebox.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.869
Are you so afraid
of someone trying to do good?

12:28.948 --> 12:30.848
You're not capable of good.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.407
You killed 600
people, remember?

12:33.552 --> 12:37.886
Come on. How many gave their
lives in search of the New World?

12:38.290 --> 12:40.850
Progress always
requires sacrifice.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.022
Sorry, lady.

12:52.805 --> 12:56.571
How many lives were
lost in man's pursuit of flight?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.176
In his exploration of space...

12:59.245 --> 13:01.179
So you are gonna keep killing.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.236
Pete!

13:05.684 --> 13:07.151
Took out the camera.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.115
Who knows, you
might find yourself surprised

13:10.189 --> 13:12.680
at what I'm going
to do for mankind.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.525
He's using an artifact
to throw his voice.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.124
Oh, brava,
Agent Bering.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.633
Now please let me
finish my work.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.532
There's no need that your lives be
sacrificed for this great achievement.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.844
You know what?
Let me tell you something.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.847
I am tired of listening
to this pile of bull...

13:40.853 --> 13:42.650
But make no mistake.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.121
I will sacrifice you if I must.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.460
Where's your father? I need
to ask him some Paracelsus questions.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.332
Don't know, don't care.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.398
Maybe this time he's
gone for good. Oh.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.100
So you're gonna go with snotty.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.403
Well, that's an
interesting choice.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.205
Artie suggested the two
of you might be helpful,

14:06.278 --> 14:08.712
but now I'm beginning
to think he oversold you.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.606
Sutton was just trying
to protect you,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.014
you can't be mad
at the guy forever.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.484
Oh, can't I?
Just watch me.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.078
Well, you don't have
forever anymore, do you, Nick?

14:17.156 --> 14:19.021
You got what you wanted,
you're gonna grow up.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.183
And part of growing up,
means you...

14:20.259 --> 14:22.250
Oh, please stop.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.886
I am 500 years old,

14:23.963 --> 14:25.988
when are people gonna stop
talking to me like I'm a child?

14:26.065 --> 14:27.760
When you stop acting like one.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.098
Geez, you wanna complain to me about
your father not thinking things through?

14:31.170 --> 14:33.502
You? The guy whose plan
involved turning me into

14:33.572 --> 14:35.233
some kind of crumbly
bronze art?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.799
I forgive you, by the way.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.842
That's what adults do.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.611
I know you didn't mean
for me to get hurt.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.674
You were just doing the best you
could with the information you had.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.345
So you're saying
I'm just like him?

14:49.421 --> 14:51.912
I'm saying you have a pretty nice view
from your glass house over there.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.449
Can we just... I need help.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.418
What can you tell me
about this phrase,

14:57.529 --> 14:59.190
"The air has
yielded to stone."

14:59.698 --> 15:00.687
I've no idea.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.266
I know it's part of your
uncle's plan, I just can't...

15:04.870 --> 15:06.997
Tell me what the immortalization
process was like.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.107
I don't remember much.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.301
It was awful.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.277
It was a cold, wet dungeon.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.743
The air was stale, even the
wood was twisted and strange.

15:17.816 --> 15:18.840
Wood?

15:19.952 --> 15:22.546
Wait, I thought it was underground, rock and stone.
Why would there be wood?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.077
I don't know.

15:24.189 --> 15:27.124
But the room he had Mother and me
chained to was covered with it.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.625
It was all shiny and polished.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.389
It felt like stone,
cold and hard.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.588
Petrified wood?

15:33.699 --> 15:37.135
He'd have to go through a lot of trouble to
put petrified wood in an underground lab.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.804
Okay, here's what
the quotation means.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.035
Could I?
No.

15:44.176 --> 15:47.509
Petrified wood is formed when plant matter
is buried, is cut off from oxygen...

15:47.579 --> 15:49.479
That would be the air.
That would be the air.

15:49.548 --> 15:52.483
When oxygen is cut off, what
that does is prevent decay.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.745
So, when water
flows through it...

15:53.819 --> 15:55.480
Water, which contains minerals.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.920
Those minerals deposit
themselves in the plant cells

15:57.990 --> 15:59.685
eventually forming a stone mold.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.325
So in cryptic speak, petrified
wood is formed when...

16:03.395 --> 16:05.795
"Air yields to stone."

16:07.166 --> 16:10.363
I wish I could go back and retake some
of those science tests I flunked.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.838
Paracelsus... Paracelsus
needs petrified wood

16:13.906 --> 16:15.134
for the immortalization
process.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.107
And apparently a lot of it.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.609
Because his lab was destroyed he needs
to go somewhere else to find it.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.145
Yeah, but why stay
in San Francisco,

16:21.213 --> 16:22.737
he can find petrified
wood anywhere.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.442
No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.308
Only in one specific area in
Western Turkey... Eastern.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.048
Eastern Turkey right near
the mouth of Euphrates River.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.417
So it's region-specific,

16:31.490 --> 16:34.050
the artifact needs that
specific wood in order to work.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.993
Right, unforts for Parry, that
area is now way overdeveloped.

16:37.062 --> 16:40.259
But 100 years ago, a bunch of
it was sent somewhere else...

16:40.332 --> 16:42.459
A certain city by the bay.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.728
Meet Lillie Hitchcock Coit.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.497
Wait, wait, wait.
My dad told me about her.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.906
She was a big supporter
of the firemen,

16:50.976 --> 16:52.876
and the benefactor
of Coit Tower.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.176
I actually knew that, too. Maybe,
but I said it first, so...

16:56.315 --> 16:58.977
What most people do not know...

16:59.351 --> 17:01.842
Is that the tower was built with
a hidden inner wall made of...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.512
Petrified wood.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.117
From the Euphrates
River region.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.584
Yeah, Coit liked the symbolism

17:06.657 --> 17:08.182
of wood that could
survive a battle with fire,

17:08.260 --> 17:09.420
much like firefighters do.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.861
So we gotta get there
before Paracelsus does.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.420
Here's how you're
gonna get him.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.296
This is a scanning disk.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.192
It was first used by
John Logie Baird in 1926.

17:18.270 --> 17:22.001
It was the world's first demonstration of
the live transmission of moving images.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.336
So we're gonna
show him a movie?

17:23.409 --> 17:24.773
No.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.672
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna use a Tesla

17:26.744 --> 17:28.736
to blast the energy
of this ribbon

17:28.814 --> 17:29.906
through our Farnsworth

17:29.982 --> 17:32.007
and transmit it
to your Farnsworth,

17:32.084 --> 17:34.177
directly at Paracelsus...

17:34.253 --> 17:37.154
Ooh, so we're gonna take him
down by remote. Exactly.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.414
And that should disconnect
him from our Warehouse.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.619
Why don't we just capture Paracelsus,
bring him back to the Warehouse...

17:42.694 --> 17:44.958
There's no time.
Mrs. Frederic is going fast,

17:45.030 --> 17:46.827
and she may not last
till you get here.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.388
Okay.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.959
Okay, so we take him
down by Tesla.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.561
We use the ribbon to disconnect
him from the Warehouse.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.964
Don't worry, Artie,
we got this.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.613
Okay, how far are
we gonna let him go?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.278
Artie?
He's starting the process.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.880
Pete, you get ready
to take him down.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.884
This is for Charlotte!

18:18.530 --> 18:19.519
Sutton, no!

18:25.537 --> 18:27.198
What the hell is going on?

18:30.742 --> 18:31.834
Artie, Artie, shoot now!

18:31.910 --> 18:32.899
Do it!

18:40.219 --> 18:41.481
Aah!

18:52.030 --> 18:53.054
Arthur.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.991
Why have you allowed
a civilian in the Warehouse?

18:56.068 --> 18:57.228
Mrs. Frederic?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.667
Mykes, hey, are you okay?

19:03.275 --> 19:04.936
Mrs. F!

19:06.612 --> 19:09.080
Pete, what's wrong?
Are you getting a vibe?

19:10.182 --> 19:12.446
Patient's flatlining.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.680
Epinephrine, stat!
Bring the cart.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.327
No!

19:32.871 --> 19:34.031
Stop!

19:39.144 --> 19:40.975
Too late, Agent Lattimer.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.071
So...

19:45.817 --> 19:48.513
Maggie and all those
patients who got well,

19:49.154 --> 19:50.348
they're all dead.

19:50.422 --> 19:51.650
Just like Istanbul.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.520
Progress demands sacrifice.

19:54.793 --> 19:55.953
I'm Paracelsus.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.953
And I shall live forever.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.029
I got this, Mykes.
Claud, track me!

20:08.106 --> 20:09.232
Yeah, I'm tracking you.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.599
Sutton!

20:10.676 --> 20:12.200
He could have killed me,
actually killed me!

20:12.311 --> 20:14.040
Yes.
Mortality is awful.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.046
What are you doing here?

20:16.114 --> 20:18.514
I had to prove to Nick, to
myself, that I deserved it.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.814
Sutton, listen to me, okay?
You have to be careful,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.786
you're not indestructible anymore.
Oh, it's not so bad...

20:22.854 --> 20:25.345
Ow! My shoulder, it's not healing.
Oh, my God!

20:25.657 --> 20:26.919
And it really hurts.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.225
I was right the first time,
this is dreadful! Come on.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.588
Look out! Look out!

20:36.868 --> 20:38.062
Hey, watch it!

20:38.403 --> 20:40.530
Shooting's not gonna
stop him, trust me.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.074
If he gets to the wharf
you'll lose him for sure.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.537
Claud, I think I got an idea.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.443
Great idea, Pete,
I'm all over it.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.447
Idea? What idea?
He's got an idea?

20:55.520 --> 20:58.614
He's a smart boy when he's not
thinking about cookies or boobies.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.225
Yeah, you may be immortal,
but you can't fly, can you?

21:08.300 --> 21:10.063
Nope, no super powers.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.662
And now you're finished.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.935
I'll be alive long after
you've gone. Yeah.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.476
As a statue. Maybe we'll
put you in a park.

21:18.543 --> 21:19.771
Let's go.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.080
The pharaoh's copper bowl

21:31.156 --> 21:32.680
tethered him to those
sick people

21:32.758 --> 21:34.885
and then, using the Stone, he
siphoned off their life force.

21:35.327 --> 21:38.819
We can learn to do this with
fewer deaths. Possibly none at all.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.995
But think of the
benefits to mankind.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.261
Why sick people?

21:43.335 --> 21:44.529
Weakened immune systems.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.161
Easier to draw from.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.030
Hundreds of innocent people.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.365
Look, we know that
you have a larger plan.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.368
So what exactly are you after?

21:54.112 --> 21:55.238
I can see you.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.544
You know, actually, shut up.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.086
Let's bronze him already.
Yeah.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.849
My sentiments exactly.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.822
He can be Warehouse 27's problem.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.892
And... He's not bronzed.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.327
I developed
the bronzing process,

22:20.405 --> 22:22.965
you think I don't know which
chemicals to ingest to prevent it?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.508
Can't we just lock him up?

22:24.976 --> 22:28.571
No, the Warehouse will still
see him as a Caretaker.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.740
The Regents will know
what to do with him.

22:30.816 --> 22:34.582
No, 500 years in one prison is
enough, I will not endure...

22:34.653 --> 22:36.280
I think I said, "shut up."

22:37.422 --> 22:39.720
So he's immortal, so what?
How about beheading?

22:39.791 --> 22:41.452
Or burning alive.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.120
Oh! Or we chop him into
tiny little bits, huh?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.220
Let's experiment.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.198
No, we have to transfer his
connection back to Mrs. Frederic,

22:48.266 --> 22:50.234
and we can't bronze him.
What about the ribbon?

22:50.302 --> 22:51.428
No, no it's too weak.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.869
At least, it's not enough for someone
as strong as he is right now.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.703
Have you considered that
I might be of more benefit

22:56.775 --> 23:00.211
to the Warehouse as Caretaker
than this Mrs. Frederic?

23:00.345 --> 23:03.212
Tiny little bits.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.345
You know what?
Till the Regents get here...

23:07.386 --> 23:09.752
Let's put him in
the Suspension Chamber.

23:09.821 --> 23:10.810
Oh!

23:13.125 --> 23:14.558
What is wrong with you, Father?

23:16.428 --> 23:18.328
It was a stupid risk, stupid.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.955
But you told me
if was my fault.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.464
I know, but...

23:21.967 --> 23:24.026
I only told you it was
your fault because

23:24.302 --> 23:26.361
I was afraid you'd
tell me it was mine.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.803
I let Paracelsus out, and
if it wasn't for me then...

23:29.307 --> 23:31.537
Mother would still be alive...
No, I'm respon... Ow!

23:32.244 --> 23:33.575
I'm responsible.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.772
I should have stopped
him a long time ago.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.713
And I should have told
you both the truth.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.007
Nick...

23:41.286 --> 23:43.254
I know I can't take
your mum's place,

23:44.423 --> 23:45.822
but as long as I draw breath,

23:46.992 --> 23:48.220
you'll never be alone.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.291
Okay, let's give it a try.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.155
Dad...

23:57.402 --> 23:59.267
Father? Yeah, "Father."
Definitely "Father."

24:00.439 --> 24:03.169
The sooner you leave, the sooner
that you can start your new lives.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.868
Yes, could you speak
to the Regents?

24:04.943 --> 24:07.377
They named me Ned.
Hating that.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.812
That's karma for all
those back taxes.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.673
You know,
I'm proud of you, Sutton.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.052
All Charlotte wanted was
to keep her family together,

24:16.121 --> 24:17.850
and you're making that happen.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.181
It's what I would want.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.991
You're not
so bad yourself.

24:23.328 --> 24:25.319
Doing all this just
to keep the world safe.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.193
Not everyone would.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.030
Yeah, you have
to be a little impressed.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.464
I am. A little impressed.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.261
Bye.

24:37.709 --> 24:38.937
Stay in touch.

24:39.244 --> 24:40.643
Or not.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.639
All right,
so you gonna tell me?

24:46.818 --> 24:48.945
You know sometimes your
vibes are very annoying?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.109
I know.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.222
I talked to my doctor, and he's
concerned about some pain.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.051
Okay, so...

24:56.761 --> 24:58.023
You've been having pain?

24:58.530 --> 25:00.896
He wants to do
the surgery today.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.693
Today? Yeah,
just in case, you know.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.637
In case of what?

25:06.705 --> 25:09.697
They remove the mass
to biopsy it.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.001
And they can see if
the cancer has, you know...

25:15.380 --> 25:16.369
Spread.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.376
It's a good thing.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.817
You know, the surgery will
tell us how bad this is,

25:21.887 --> 25:24.185
and then I can
start to fight it.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.589
Okay, I'm gonna go with you.
What? No.

25:27.893 --> 25:28.882
No.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.592
No, I...

25:31.730 --> 25:35.029
Pete, I don't want anyone there,
so I will just call you...

25:35.133 --> 25:36.862
Myka, I don't want
you to leave me.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.060
Okay? I just, I...

25:41.306 --> 25:43.501
I got a thing about
that and I...

25:46.845 --> 25:48.176
I know you do.

25:50.749 --> 25:51.738
I know.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.412
Look, I am not going anywhere.

25:59.958 --> 26:00.947
Hey!

26:01.459 --> 26:03.586
I could use
a little help in here.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.995
When you're...
When you're done.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.159
We're almost done.
I just, I have a...

26:10.235 --> 26:11.668
I have a thing to do.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.432
Yeah, you do your...
I'll be...

26:14.506 --> 26:16.303
Okay, okay.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.299
Pete...

26:20.045 --> 26:21.979
Everything is going to be fine.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.909
It's okay. I'm fine.

26:25.483 --> 26:26.814
Okay.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.853
Everything's going to be fine.
Okay.

26:44.636 --> 26:45.762
Hey, Artie.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.403
How's Mrs. F?

26:48.473 --> 26:51.772
Well, her
memory's almost gone.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.242
Well, the Regents are
working on a solution,

26:53.311 --> 26:54.573
but so far...

26:55.313 --> 26:57.372
Nothing. And I have
run out of ideas.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.883
Paracelsus is the only one that
knows anything about this.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.316
Well,
he's not talking.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.445
Yeah, well, you know, Artie,

27:04.589 --> 27:06.352
there's a lot of things
I can't do anything about.

27:06.424 --> 27:09.257
But I can do something about this.
Wait, wait, wait...

27:09.327 --> 27:12.023
What are you gonna do? I'm
gonna find out what he knows.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.860
Trust me.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.832
I'm feeling very persuasive.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.328
Artie, hey.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.404
We need to talk.
No. No.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.806
We don't need to talk.
You need to go.

27:24.876 --> 27:26.867
You didn't see Joshua.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.640
Yeah. No, I spoke
with his office at CERN,

27:28.713 --> 27:29.941
he's been there for weeks now.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.812
If whatever you did has
Claudia still in danger...

27:31.883 --> 27:32.975
Steve, don't worry about it.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.279
Claudia is fine.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.876
If you didn't use family
DNA, then what...

27:35.954 --> 27:37.216
Stop.

27:37.522 --> 27:38.921
You don't understand,

27:39.724 --> 27:41.419
okay?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.393
The DNA is fine.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.985
I'm protecting her.

27:45.063 --> 27:47.429
You can still protect her

27:47.499 --> 27:50.059
if you tell her the truth.

27:50.135 --> 27:51.659
It may be even safer.

27:51.736 --> 27:53.067
If she knows,

27:53.138 --> 27:55.333
she can be prepared for it.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.534
Prepared for what?
What truth?

27:58.009 --> 27:59.874
I'll be gone soon.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.843
If she becomes the Caretaker,

28:01.913 --> 28:03.380
she'll find out anyway.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.207
It'll be best if you told her.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.343
No, no.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.785
What if she's not ready?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.685
I believe Miss Donovan

28:12.090 --> 28:15.719
would say she was born ready.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.857
She was, wasn't she?

28:21.766 --> 28:23.961
Okay.
All right. My God.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.768
I... I'll tell her.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.806
It's okay, Artie.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.778
You know, if it were up
to me, we wouldn't be talking.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.984
But you tell me how
to save Mrs. Frederic,

28:42.053 --> 28:45.819
and I'll make sure that you get handed
over to the Regents in one piece.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.756
I have no idea how to save her.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.350
No, I think you do.

28:50.295 --> 28:53.628
I know you're upset, it can't
be easy with your friend dying.

28:53.698 --> 28:56.360
Mrs. Frederic is more
than a friend, pal.

28:56.434 --> 28:59.232
She... No, no, not her.
What is it...

28:59.304 --> 29:01.329
The young one... Myka.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.203
She's very, very ill.

29:03.274 --> 29:04.866
You didn't know?

29:05.477 --> 29:06.774
Myka is dying.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.052
No.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.057
No. You...

29:20.125 --> 29:23.856
You're wrong. Myka...

29:23.928 --> 29:26.453
Myka's going to be fine...
Er... She's...

29:26.531 --> 29:29.022
Having the surgery and
they'll take out the cancer.

29:29.134 --> 29:31.193
No, it has spread.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.100
Far beyond whatever
they can remove.

29:36.241 --> 29:38.539
Oh, please, how could you
possibly know that?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.202
Her eyes.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.542
I saw it in her eyes.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.241
He said he could see my cancer.
In my eyes.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.349
Spots on the iris.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.548
They can reveal things
about someone's health.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.221
But you know this.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.328
You know she's been lying.
You felt it.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.061
She's going to die.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.803
Now I suppose you can help her.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.607
This is the Warehouse.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.666
There are things here
that can help.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.838
Sorry, pal, but we don't
use the artifacts.

30:15.914 --> 30:19.577
Oh, if I was to tell you
which artifacts can help her,

30:19.651 --> 30:21.482
you would seriously do nothing?

30:21.553 --> 30:23.180
You would let them
sit on the shelf,

30:24.088 --> 30:25.680
rather than saving her life?

30:33.731 --> 30:34.720
Hey.

30:35.066 --> 30:36.431
You wanted to see me?

30:36.634 --> 30:38.431
Hey, yeah. Um...

30:39.037 --> 30:41.699
Listen, there's something
we should discuss.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.002
Oh, boy.
I know that tone.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.736
Uh, Artie, I'm not ready to
talk about being Caretaker...

30:46.811 --> 30:48.540
Oh, no, no... We're gonna find
a way to save Mrs. Frederic...

30:48.613 --> 30:49.841
Claudia, it's about
something else

30:49.914 --> 30:51.176
you may not want to hear...
The Regents are gonna...

30:51.249 --> 30:52.739
Would you please listen to me!

30:55.920 --> 30:57.217
The DNA...

30:58.189 --> 31:00.783
That slowed down the
decomposition of the bronze...

31:03.695 --> 31:05.356
I didn't get that from Joshua.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.690
Oh?
There was just no time.

31:08.833 --> 31:11.028
Your life was in danger.
Your life, okay?

31:11.402 --> 31:13.666
I had to have a blood relative.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.333
I got the sample...

31:18.810 --> 31:20.209
From your sister.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.544
What? No.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.713
That doesn't, um...

31:26.818 --> 31:27.807
Claire was killed.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.047
Claire was killed in the car
accident that killed my parents.

31:30.121 --> 31:32.419
Uh, Joshua told me about it,
I've been to their graves...

31:32.724 --> 31:34.021
Claudia...

31:36.761 --> 31:37.955
Your sister's alive.

31:41.933 --> 31:45.630
The last time your artifact
"cured" people, you murdered!

31:45.703 --> 31:48.297
That's different. These are
two specific artifacts,

31:48.640 --> 31:51.234
minimal downside. You can see
for yourself, look at the tags.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.968
And I'm not being altruistic.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.208
I want something in exchange.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.812
Oh, there it is.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.875
Yes, of course.
There's a catch.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.016
No, no, no. Listen...

32:04.889 --> 32:06.914
The Regents will
punish me severely.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.525
Now I'm immortal,
it will be for forever.

32:11.796 --> 32:15.095
You have no idea,
no idea, what it was like...

32:15.500 --> 32:16.626
Conscious.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.626
And yet inert, in bronze.

32:19.704 --> 32:22.468
I am a scientist.
My mind cannot stop.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.002
I cannot endure.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.600
No, I conceive, I conceive...

32:28.112 --> 32:30.444
That you want me to beg them,

32:31.449 --> 32:32.711
to show you mercy.

32:32.817 --> 32:36.309
No, no, no. I want you to
ask them to erase my mind.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.688
As if I didn't exist.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.581
They must have
that power by now.

32:41.526 --> 32:42.652
The Janus Coin.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.524
The Janus Coin
will facilitate

32:45.596 --> 32:48.656
the separation of a person's
consciousness from their body.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.262
It would be like killing.

32:52.337 --> 32:53.565
It's what you want.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.165
Do this and I'll help you combine
the artifacts that can cure Myka.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.708
I don't understand.
I know, it's a lot to take in.

33:06.784 --> 33:08.513
Claire is alive.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.781
My sister is alive.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.051
And you knew...

33:13.124 --> 33:14.216
And you didn't tell me.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.817
None of this was easy, I really had
to make an informed decision...

33:16.894 --> 33:18.384
Oh, an informed decision?
Yeah.

33:18.463 --> 33:19.828
That must have been so nice.

33:19.897 --> 33:22.092
Listen, it's not that simple, Claudia.
Could you listen...

33:22.166 --> 33:23.929
Does Joshua know?

33:26.704 --> 33:29.696
Does Claire know about me?
Does she know where I am?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.198
How long have you known?

33:31.275 --> 33:33.709
No, Claudia. You're focusing
on the wrong thing...

33:33.778 --> 33:35.075
When...

33:35.713 --> 33:36.839
Did you...

33:37.148 --> 33:38.137
Know?

33:39.917 --> 33:44.286
It was part of my intel when I was
tracking Rheticus' Compass, so I knew...

33:46.591 --> 33:47.683
Before I met you.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.631
No, sir. Miss Bering
is still in surgery.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.269
What? No, no, no,
no, no, no.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.937
She was supposed
to be out by now.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.581
Look, what's going on?
Were there complications?

34:11.849 --> 34:13.817
I'm sorry. I don't have you
listed as the next of kin.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.045
You'll have to wait
till the doctor...

34:15.119 --> 34:18.020
No, never mind. I was
gonna ask her, I just...

34:18.856 --> 34:20.585
Never mind. Thanks.

34:21.859 --> 34:23.224
I know what to do.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.150
Okay.

34:25.596 --> 34:26.960
I got 'em, right?

34:27.065 --> 34:30.034
The thing from Hippocrates' robe
and the Chinese guy's scalpel.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.661
Now tell me how to use these
things, so I can save Myka.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.797
Bring the clasp to
1,940 degrees Fahrenheit.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.364
You must use caution, as it will
begin to evaporate quickly.

34:38.443 --> 34:40.377
What? How the hell
am I gonna do that?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.911
Well, I'm sure there's something here
you can use, it's the Warehouse.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.608
Okay, fine, fine. Let's just say I can.
What do I do then?

34:45.683 --> 34:47.150
I just...
I dip the scalpel in?

34:47.217 --> 34:49.550
No, no, no. Artifacts are
extremely unstable.

34:49.620 --> 34:53.112
You must introduce the scalpel
into the molten metal,

34:53.190 --> 34:55.022
exactly half a centimeter
at a time.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.958
You must be precise
or the result could kill her.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.560
Great. No pressure.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.824
I'll talk you through it. I've
devoted my life to this science...

35:00.932 --> 35:02.263
Yeah, well,
this is Myka's life.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.298
Agent Lattimer,
we're running out of time.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.763
Once the Regents arrive,
I can't help you.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.098
No.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.739
No, I can't. I can't.
I can't, okay?

35:12.810 --> 35:14.539
What if I mix
them wrong and I...

35:17.949 --> 35:19.007
You.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.474
You can do it.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.042
So you can blame me,
if it goes wrong?

35:23.154 --> 35:24.212
No, no.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.755
You're her best shot.

35:25.823 --> 35:29.088
You said it yourself, I mean, I'm not
gonna let something sit on the shelf

35:29.160 --> 35:30.684
that can save Myka.
Not even you.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.023
First I'll make you
mortal again.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.154
No.

35:35.233 --> 35:36.598
You have no idea
how the Stone works.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.692
You can talk me
through it, right?

35:39.670 --> 35:42.571
Then you save Myka. Of course, I'll
have a gun to your head the whole time,

35:42.640 --> 35:45.700
but once you're mortal again, you don't need
to worry about eternal Regent punishment.

35:45.776 --> 35:46.800
No, no.
I don't think...

35:47.011 --> 35:49.343
No, it's this or forget it.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.576
You have been lying to me.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.919
It's complicated. No.
No. It's a lie.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.650
And you've been doing it
as long as I've known you.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.954
Please, look, it was for
your own protection.

36:02.126 --> 36:03.354
Protect me from what?

36:03.427 --> 36:04.951
From...
From the truth?

36:05.029 --> 36:07.998
Your sister, she's an
incredibly dangerous woman!

36:13.538 --> 36:16.530
This will reverse everything
I've worked for my entire life.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.538
Okay, so the temperature
doesn't matter?

36:18.709 --> 36:21.075
No. Just do it quickly,
before I change my mind.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.028
Oh, God.

36:48.105 --> 36:49.800
That didn't happen
when you used it on...

36:49.941 --> 36:51.203
What the hell?

36:52.076 --> 36:53.100
No, it didn't.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.701
How did you get...

37:04.488 --> 37:07.457
When the Stone is used
in proximity to the Eldunari,

37:07.725 --> 37:11.627
the Caretaker's link to the Warehouse
is increased exponentially.

37:12.196 --> 37:13.493
Oh, yeah...

37:13.698 --> 37:16.132
The Eldunari in the Warehouse
is a pretty good trick,

37:16.601 --> 37:17.829
but it's not gonna stop me from

37:17.902 --> 37:19.267
kicking your ass!

37:25.443 --> 37:28.742
I am now in complete
control of the Warehouse.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.746
Thank you so much.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.414
You will be very useful
for my future endeavors.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.643
This is my house now!

37:39.523 --> 37:40.922
Artie!

37:42.059 --> 37:43.048
Artie!

37:46.030 --> 37:48.692
Artie, something bad.
Something really bad.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.563
Paracelsus...

37:50.868 --> 37:52.267
His connection's
even stronger now.

37:53.571 --> 37:54.799
This is it...

37:55.239 --> 37:56.570
This is the end.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.597
Whoa, what are you doing?

37:58.676 --> 38:00.007
Oh, my God.

38:12.156 --> 38:17.423
The ribbon wasn't strong enough
to disconnect Paracelsus.

38:17.528 --> 38:19.587
No, but you could still
disconnect Mrs. Frederic.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.422
I'm so sorry.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.867
The choice was this or death.

38:24.268 --> 38:25.633
Thank you, Claudia.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.429
That means that
Mrs. Frederic is...

38:28.873 --> 38:30.204
No longer the Caretaker.

38:30.441 --> 38:32.534
And she may never be again.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.803
Paracelsus is more
than just the Caretaker now.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.514
I felt him take complete
control of the Warehouse.

38:39.717 --> 38:41.048
We must leave now.

38:43.554 --> 38:44.714
You got what you want,

38:44.789 --> 38:46.017
why don't you just kill me?

38:46.390 --> 38:47.721
I have no need to kill you.

38:48.659 --> 38:52.686
My first act as sole Caretaker
will be to expel all my enemies.

38:54.465 --> 38:55.625
So, get out of my Warehouse.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.836
Oh, my God.
Pete, are you all right?

39:02.306 --> 39:03.773
No, definitely not.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.000
Mrs. F, are you all right?

39:07.378 --> 39:09.346
I've seen better days,
Agent Lattimer.

39:12.650 --> 39:13.776
It's Paracelsus.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.445
He's literally trying to chase
us out of the Warehouse.

39:16.554 --> 39:17.578
Guys, we've got
to get out here.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.350
No, no, no. The umbilicus
was cut off by the quake.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.821
We need another exit.
Come on.

39:27.631 --> 39:28.893
There are other exits, right?

39:29.066 --> 39:30.055
Follow me.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.177
My house now!

39:53.257 --> 39:55.122
Up there.
The way out.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.330
Let's go, let's go!

40:06.070 --> 40:07.401
I can't go.

40:07.872 --> 40:08.861
Claud?

40:09.039 --> 40:10.097
I have to stay.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.471
No, absolutely not.

40:12.276 --> 40:13.402
You don't know how you know it,

40:13.477 --> 40:15.069
but you know it, don't you?

40:15.679 --> 40:17.203
The Warehouse needs me. I...

40:18.182 --> 40:19.945
I have to stay
and fight Paracelsus.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.016
No, no.
It's too dangerous.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.346
Artie, you have made enough
calls about my safety,

40:24.455 --> 40:25.820
I'm deciding this one.

40:26.457 --> 40:27.617
I'm sorry.
Listen to me...

40:32.863 --> 40:34.490
The Warehouse will protect me.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.966
Yes, I believe it might.

40:38.035 --> 40:40.162
We have to stop this freak.
If you stay...

40:40.404 --> 40:42.964
He might kill you all and
I can't stop him myself.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.032
I can't just leave you here.

40:45.676 --> 40:47.871
I'll fight him from the inside and
you'll fight him from the outside.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.469
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this, Jinksy.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.042
Yes.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.811
You need us to live,
so we can fight another day.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.450
Come. There's no time.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.030
You know, I...

41:12.803 --> 41:14.100
Very much...

41:15.105 --> 41:16.572
I know. Me, too.

41:18.075 --> 41:19.064
You have to go.

41:27.618 --> 41:28.778
Claud.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.714
Claud, I'm really sorry.

41:30.788 --> 41:31.914
It's not your fault.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.488
I'm counting on you to stop this
guy more than anybody, okay?

41:36.193 --> 41:37.319
I will.

41:37.761 --> 41:39.558
I swear it. I will,
whatever it takes.

42:24.675 --> 42:26.768
Paracelsus has the Warehouse.

42:27.778 --> 42:29.370
And he has Claudia.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.305
How?
