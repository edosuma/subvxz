00:53.303 --> 00:57.098
-(men clamoring)
-(grunts)

00:57.140 --> 00:59.934
Please. Please, don't.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.228
(sobbing)

01:12.322 --> 01:14.574
(screaming)

01:19.037 --> 01:21.289
(screaming continues)

01:51.111 --> 01:53.279
LANGDON:
When it comes to symbols
of the past,

01:53.321 --> 01:56.783
what was relevant then

01:56.825 --> 01:58.493
is relevant now.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.120
-(door closes)
-Sure, there are
a lot less people

02:00.161 --> 02:02.706
who think they can
change the weather with runes

02:02.747 --> 02:04.332
or summon the devil
with a pentagram.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.668
-Looking at you, Clark.
-(students chuckle)

02:06.710 --> 02:09.004
But there are still
a lot of people

02:09.045 --> 02:12.257
who ascribe
extranatural powers to symbols.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.217
The sign of the cross.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.136
The number 13.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.971
Four-leaf clover.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.181
Luck symbols.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.516
Bad luck symbols.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.353
Symbols that cure
or curse or protect.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.689
It's all superstition,

02:27.731 --> 02:30.191
but people can believe
what they want.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.278
Right?
It's a free country.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.988
At what point, though...

02:35.780 --> 02:39.701
...do their convictions
and your pursuit of happiness

02:39.743 --> 02:42.495
become mutually exclusive?

02:42.537 --> 02:45.415
When do benign symbols

02:45.457 --> 02:48.585
become malignant?

03:08.480 --> 03:10.815
What was relevant then

03:10.857 --> 03:13.610
is relevant now.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.862
The difference is
that now people can push symbols

03:15.904 --> 03:18.031
out to millions
with the click of a button.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.284
Promoting myths as fact.

03:21.326 --> 03:25.413
And in this post-truth world,
where does that leave us?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.707
Where do we draw the line

03:27.749 --> 03:31.419
between respecting
the beliefs of others

03:31.461 --> 03:34.547
-and calling bullsh...
-(phone vibrates)

03:38.802 --> 03:41.888
-MAN: Professor Langdon? Hello?
-Hi.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.473
I-I was expecting Peter.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.266
Yes, sorry,
I'm his new assistant.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.810
He asked me to jump on
and let you know

03:46.851 --> 03:48.436
about a kind of urgent
situation.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.355
He could use your help.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.107
What, the secretary
of the Smithsonian

03:52.148 --> 03:53.274
can't ask his own favors?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.693
It's last-minute, I-I know,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.444
but he said he can count on you.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.030
Oh, I'm-I'm kidding.
Wh-Whatever I can do.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.407
Terrific.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.118
Do you think you can
get to D.C. by 5:00?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.494
What, like, tonight?

04:04.536 --> 04:07.497
-(bell chimes)
-MONK: Tayatha om

04:07.539 --> 04:11.251
bekandze bekandze maha

04:11.292 --> 04:14.129
bekandze maha bekandze.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.757
Radza samudgate soha.

04:18.758 --> 04:19.968
Tayatha

04:20.010 --> 04:23.430

04:23.471 --> 04:25.682
-(door opens)
-(typing)

04:27.475 --> 04:29.436
(door closes)

04:29.477 --> 04:31.438
How's Monk-chella?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.440
See for yourself.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.483
(chanting continuing faintly)

04:36.526 --> 04:39.863
-TRISH: This is
a live image, right?
-KATHERINE: Mm-hmm.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.034
So, cell growth has been
almost completely arrested.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.662
And keep in mind,
this isn't just any cancer.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.956
These cells
are poorly differentiated,

04:49.998 --> 04:52.417
chemo-resistant,
highly aggressive.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.545
And these guys
sung them right to sleep.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.631
This is breakthrough stuff.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.175
Harnessing the power

05:00.216 --> 05:02.344
of focused thought beats
the hell out of chemo, right?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.263
And we may only
be scratching the surface.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.391
(phone vibrates)

05:17.692 --> 05:20.362
Langdon, this is a surprise.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.905
To what do I owe this pleasure?

05:21.946 --> 05:23.698
Well, you can thank your dad.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.284
Apparently the keynote speaker
for his gala got sick,

05:26.326 --> 05:27.869
so he wants me to step in.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.621
I don't know anything
about a gala.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.539
The Smithsonian Gala
at the Capitol.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.458
He didn't mention it?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.043
He may have.
I've just been so buried.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.462
But that's nice of you
to come in on such short notice.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.673
You know I'd do anything
for Peter.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.591
Yeah, and a captive audience.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.385
-That's a slander.
-Come on.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.388
Beguiling a room full
of wealthy, half-drunk patrons

05:46.429 --> 05:49.099
with your historical expertise?
It's pretty much your dream.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.642
That's nice.
Okay.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.770
Uh, I thought maybe
we could have dinner tonight.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.773
I can't.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.150
-Hey, no. No worries.
-I'm right in the middle

05:59.192 --> 06:01.903
of an experiment. We're seeing
some incredible phenomena.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.572
Like moving dice with your mind?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.157
You know, my dad
thought he could do that.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.575
And there it is.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.493
You know I think
you're brilliant.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.661
It's just your field.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.912
Noetic science.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.372
You should remember those words.
One day,

06:12.414 --> 06:13.957
-they're going
to rewrite physics.
-Ah.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.252
-When do you get in?
-Oh, I didn't mention it?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.879
I'm already here.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.095
NUÑEZ:
Did y'all just meet here?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.389
You picked up a date?
Here?

06:29.431 --> 06:30.849
That-that...
He's smooth, man.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.434
I like your style, man.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.561
We're finding love over here.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.691
-(beep)
-That's okay.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.484
-Come on. Step over.
-I thought that might happen.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.778
I'm wearing a ring under this.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.281
My finger was too swollen
to get it off.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.657
Oh, yeah? (chuckles)
Open up.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.367
Thank you.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.787
My girlfriend says, you know,
a man shouldn't wear jewelry,

06:52.829 --> 06:54.622
-but I disagree.
-(wand beeps)

06:54.664 --> 06:55.957
Must have hurt.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.625
Yeah, you'd think
after 30 years,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.294
I'd be able to walk
down an icy driveway

06:59.336 --> 07:00.795
without falling on my ass.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
-No, I-I meant the ink.
-Mm.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.258
You know, I got a Little Mermaid
tattoo on my back,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.385
and I almost cried
when they put it on.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.928
-A Little Mermaid.
-Yeah.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.805
Well, that must have
been some party.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.475
Well, you know how it is.
Misspent youth.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.518
Yeah, well, same here, I guess.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.815
I'd like to, um, get a good look
inside before you close.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.735
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, you're all good to go.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.617
God bless you.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.667
NUÑEZ:
Everything okay, sir?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.543
Yeah.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.462
Can't read my own writing.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.756
-Hmm.
-Um...

07:44.798 --> 07:47.092
Thank you. Thanks.
Statuary Hall?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.720
-It's, uh, upstairs,
to the left.
-Thanks.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.402
Excuse me. Hey.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.028
Sorry. Um,

08:07.070 --> 08:09.322
there's supposed to be
a Smithsonian event in there.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.574
Nothing on the schedule.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.453
Maybe it got moved
to another room.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.414
I-I'm supposed to give a speech.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.082
I doubt it.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.043
But don't let that stop you.
I'm a real good listener.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.921
-(phone vibrates)
-(chuckles)

08:24.963 --> 08:26.256
Peter.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.049
Nobody's here.
Did I get the time wrong?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.510
MAN:
No. You followed
directions perfectly,

08:30.552 --> 08:32.220
which bodes well.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.723
But the hall's locked.
Th-There's no event.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.392
I'm sorry, c-could you
just put Peter on?

08:37.434 --> 08:40.353
(chuckles)

08:40.395 --> 08:42.230
Peter is in the A'raf.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.024
I'm sorry, what?

08:44.065 --> 08:47.277
The borderland
between heaven and hell.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.821
Yeah, thank you.
I know what the A'raf is.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.531
And whether he returns
to your world

08:51.573 --> 08:55.410
or moves on to the next
will depend on your actions.

08:56.202 --> 09:00.081
There exists within the city
an ancient portal.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.167
Now, I need you to find it.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.294
And unlock it.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.338
An ancient portal.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.050
I know Peter likes to be
the center of attention, but...

09:10.091 --> 09:12.093
this is objectively extreme.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.096
Um, Peter, if you're listening,
honestly, consider medication.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.557
For someone
with so much knowledge,

09:17.599 --> 09:20.685
you know so little.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
But that will change.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.736
You will solve
the great mystery.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.073
-It looks so real.
-MAN: And Peter

09:33.114 --> 09:35.867
-will point the way.
-Well, where is he?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.620
MAN:
As above,

09:38.661 --> 09:40.038
so below.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.208
-Hello?
-(woman screams)

09:43.249 --> 09:46.044
* *

09:52.467 --> 09:54.678
(indistinct chatter)

09:57.931 --> 09:59.933
Hey, okay,
we're clearing this area.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.643
-Phones away. Sir.
-OFFICER: Ma'am. Ma'am.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.269
NUÑEZ:
Sir, please. Phones away.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.397
Keep it moving.
Ma'am. Thank you.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.815
Clearing this out.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.025
Get these guys...
Get these guys away from here.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.276
Please, keep moving.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.070
Thank you.
We're closed up now.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.322
Clearing this out.
Thank you.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.324
Sir?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.493
Sir.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.371
LANGDON:
I know these symbols.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.920
He's got Peter.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.673
That's his ring.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.967
NUÑEZ:
Stay right there.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.807
* *

10:57.198 --> 10:59.576
PETER: The shucking
of the oyster. We break in

10:59.617 --> 11:02.287
at the hinge here.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.706
Then we...

11:04.748 --> 11:07.334
tear through
the adductor muscle.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.878
Sure not to break the mantle.
Et voilà.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.129
-(Isabel chuckles)
-Wow.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.547
ISABEL: Don't worry.
He does this

11:12.589 --> 11:14.507
-every year.
-The oysters or the TED Talk?

11:14.549 --> 11:16.885
-(chuckles)
-PETER: One of the many lies

11:16.926 --> 11:19.012
told to us at Thanksgiving

11:19.054 --> 11:21.890
is that early American settlers
feasted

11:21.931 --> 11:25.518
on turkey.
Now, duck, maybe. Swan, even.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.812
But most certainly, bountifully,

11:27.854 --> 11:30.774
-on oysters.
-My dad would rather us be

11:30.815 --> 11:32.692
historically accurate
than happy.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.569
PETER:
Robert appreciates history.
He may be

11:34.611 --> 11:35.904
one of the sharpest students

11:35.945 --> 11:37.322
I've ever known.
But I've told him

11:37.364 --> 11:39.240
that raw intellect
can only get you so far.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.658
KATHERINE:
Raw oysters,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.161
on the other hand,
is a very different story.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.913
PETER:
Indeed, it is.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.291
-I lost track of time.
-Well, Descartes
will do that to you.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.253
My daughter is doing a thesis
on Passions of the Soul.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.756
ISABEL:
I originally thought
it was a romance novel,

11:54.798 --> 11:57.550
but I was wrong.
It is not.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.928
Well, it does
romanticize nonsense.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.471
Have you ever read him?

12:03.473 --> 12:05.016
I-I tried.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.602
Genius mathematician.
He lost me

12:07.644 --> 12:09.896
when he said the pineal gland
was the gateway

12:09.938 --> 12:11.606
-to the soul.
-Can you disprove it?

12:11.648 --> 12:14.109
Do I need to?
A-As far as I can tell,

12:14.150 --> 12:15.819
he had a prehistoric
understanding of anatomy.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.821
And yet he posited
psychophysiological laws

12:17.862 --> 12:21.449
-that are still relevant today.
-Psychophysiological.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.034
Oh, that's right.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.036
Peter mentioned
you're into the pseudosciences.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.830
-Did he?
-PETER: "A credible mind

12:26.871 --> 12:29.958
drawn to incredible things"

12:30.000 --> 12:31.793
-is the way I put it.
-Mm.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.504
I suggest we change the subject.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.132
Zachary, why don't you tell us
about your itinerary.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.676
PETER:
Yes, my son is going
to the Middle East

12:39.718 --> 12:41.219
to lay siege to the beaches

12:41.261 --> 12:43.722
-of Aqaba.
-Just to get away
from here, really.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.433
Really? Why?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.812
Oh, I-I just mean, uh,

12:50.854 --> 12:52.147
is it always like this?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.190
Like, debating,
exchanging ideas,

12:54.232 --> 12:57.360
even if they aren't...
credibly rational?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.155
(chuckles):
What... I-I just mean, um...

13:00.864 --> 13:02.991
You're all very lucky...

13:03.033 --> 13:05.243
to have this.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.330
You really hit the jackpot
with this one, Dad.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.415
Each year,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.584
Professor Solomon
takes in a stray

13:12.625 --> 13:15.295
for Thanksgiving as some sort
of a charitable exercise,

13:15.337 --> 13:17.839
but, really, he's just looking

13:17.881 --> 13:19.883
for a new audience
to fawn over him.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.676
What he doesn't realize is

13:21.718 --> 13:25.055
you don't really care
any more than we do.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.559
I care.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.229
-(chuckles)
-I think he really does.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.274
Can we keep him?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.776
PETER:
I think

13:37.817 --> 13:40.987
he's earned an open invitation.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.992
(indistinct chatter)

13:46.743 --> 13:48.870
All right, let me know
when you hear from the chief.

13:48.912 --> 13:49.996
In the meantime,
we sweep the building

13:50.038 --> 13:51.456
and keep it locked down.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.791
-OFFICER: Roger that.
-Are you in charge here

13:52.832 --> 13:54.626
-or what?
-Yeah. Um, for now.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.045
For now? What does
that-what does that mean?

13:57.087 --> 14:00.090
Just give me a sec, okay?
Ma'am, you can't be here.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.008
-This is a crime scene.
-Maybe you shouldn't let

14:02.050 --> 14:04.386
a bunch of tourists
tweet photos of it.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.680
-Excuse me?
-Just a thought.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.223
Oh, sorry.
(chuckles)

14:08.264 --> 14:09.933
I should have this on.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.685
Inoue Sato.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.312
CIA? I-I thought the Bureau
handled kidnappings.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.565
They do.
Sometimes. It depends.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.734
I can't really
say anything else.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.405
Those two are with me, by the
way. They'll need full access.

14:23.446 --> 14:26.074
So, I understand this hand may
have belonged to Peter Solomon.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.575
Yeah. You know him?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.911
-Of him.
-Ah, well,
this is Robert Langdon.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.330
He's a coworker
of Mr. Solomon's.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.874
-The suspect called him. Twice.
-Yeah,

14:34.916 --> 14:36.126
we-we're not coworkers.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.752
I teach at Harvard.
Symbology.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.129
Peter was my mentor.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.922
This morning,
I got a call from his assistant.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.549
Least, thought it was
his assistant.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.092
He said that Peter
wanted me to come down,

14:44.134 --> 14:45.468
speak at the Capitol
at this gala.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.928
Peter's not known
for his consideration

14:46.970 --> 14:48.263
of other people's time,

14:48.304 --> 14:49.723
so it didn't seem
out of the ordinary to me

14:49.764 --> 14:51.975
-to get on a plane...
-Robert. Take a breath.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.019
(exhales)

14:54.060 --> 14:56.438
Did this person
say what he wants?

14:56.479 --> 14:59.190
Uh... it won't
make sense to you.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.650
Tell me anyway.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.987
He said he's looking
for an ancient portal

15:04.029 --> 15:05.113
buried within the city.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.740
He wants me to locate

15:06.781 --> 15:09.284
-and unlock it.
-And that means something
to you?

15:09.325 --> 15:12.078
It didn't until I saw that.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.122
On the other three fingers,

15:14.164 --> 15:16.041
I expect you'll find
more tattoos.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.794
A sun, a lantern and a key.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.504
* *

15:25.592 --> 15:28.428
He's replicated
the Hand of the Mysteries.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.806
It's an icon you see
throughout history.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.933
The alchemists, the cabalists.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.729
It's an invitation to seek
a body of ancient knowledge

15:37.771 --> 15:40.065
beyond a mystical gateway.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.733
-A portal.
-NUÑEZ: Yeah, the suspect

15:41.775 --> 15:44.152
walked through security earlier
with his hand in a sling

15:44.194 --> 15:45.362
like it was his.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.072
And he was wearing makeup,
I think.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.866
-Concealer.
-You got a good eye.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.660
See if the sergeant
can pull some security stills

15:52.702 --> 15:55.789
of the suspect.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.165
The ring on Peter's hand--

15:57.207 --> 15:59.334
33rd-degree Mason.
From what I remember,

15:59.376 --> 16:02.045
that comes with some
ancient knowledge of its own.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.505
Despite what some people think,

16:03.546 --> 16:06.257
the Masons
are essentially a social club.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.510
Still, it could explain
why he was targeted.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.804
If this guy thought Peter knew
about the portal thing...

16:10.845 --> 16:12.597
Then he would've been
sorely disappointed.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.433
Peter knows that what this guy
is after doesn't exist.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.852
He has a daughter, right? What's
your relationship with her?

16:17.894 --> 16:20.230
-Uh, we're friends.
-We need to make sure
she's secure,

16:20.271 --> 16:21.690
and we'll need a DNA reference

16:21.731 --> 16:23.775
to confirm that's actually
her father's hand.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.319
Uh, let me do it.
Let me-let me call her first.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.575
(phone vibrates)

16:36.371 --> 16:38.248
-Hey.
-LANGDON: Katherine.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.874
Something's happened.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.918
It's your dad. He...

16:41.960 --> 16:43.336
He's been taken.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.047
And, um, I don't know exactly
what's going on,

16:46.089 --> 16:48.591
but we're gonna get him back.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.677
* *

16:54.180 --> 16:56.099
(phone vibrates)

16:58.935 --> 17:01.396
Have they left the Rotunda?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.023
OFFICER:
Hey!

17:03.064 --> 17:05.900
Hey, you can't be in here, man.
Park's closed.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.528
Sorry, I didn't realize.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.115
Hey, Ma, I got to go.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.784
Rich!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.704
Those yours?

17:17.746 --> 17:20.081
Uh, does it look
like I'd wear that?

17:20.123 --> 17:23.376
RICH:
So that wasn't you
by the Capitol earlier?

17:23.418 --> 17:26.463
Oh, yeah. They were vetting me
for the Supreme Court.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.340
Yeah, very cute.
Let's see some ID.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.342
Man, I don't...
I don't want any trouble.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.136
RICH:
Just want to see some ID, sir.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.389
Of course.
Yeah. Yeah.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.808
-(grunting)
-OFFICER: Hey!

17:41.770 --> 17:43.063
(choking)

17:43.104 --> 17:45.315
(grunting)

17:54.783 --> 17:57.077
No! Stop!

17:57.118 --> 17:59.329
(screaming)

18:02.123 --> 18:04.751
(whimpering)
No.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.836
(panting)

18:10.131 --> 18:12.342
(grunts)

18:25.313 --> 18:26.648
Liberty. Freedom.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.484
E pluribus unum.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.947
13. 13. 13 states.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.949
Local PD found Solomon's car

18:35.990 --> 18:37.492
in a lot off of Canal Road.

18:37.534 --> 18:41.413
No cameras. No witnesses.
No signs of struggle.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.833
You know, it would
be helpful if I knew

18:44.874 --> 18:47.293
what our actual interest
in this is.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.296
I know.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.553
Liberty. Freedom.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.513
13 maidens.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.015
SATO:
What's he doing?

19:00.056 --> 19:02.559
No idea.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.188
"Peter will point the way."

19:07.230 --> 19:09.357
He said that on the call.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.568
The fresco above us

19:11.609 --> 19:15.321
is Brumidi's
Apotheosis of Washington.

19:15.363 --> 19:19.200
From the Greek "apo," to become,
and "theos," God.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.578
There, in the central panel,

19:21.619 --> 19:23.163
George Washington is ascending

19:23.204 --> 19:25.373
on a cloud above the mortals.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.375
His moment of transformation.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.169
I think this guy

19:29.210 --> 19:31.921
is telling us what he wants.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.008
Apotheosis.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.552
To become a god.
And he thinks he can do that

19:37.594 --> 19:39.054
by accessing
this ancient knowledge?

19:39.095 --> 19:41.890
It was said to hold the keys
to unlocking abilities

19:41.931 --> 19:44.225
that lay dormant
in the human mind.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.435
I'm-I'm playing catch-up,

19:45.477 --> 19:47.437
but th-the ransom
is superpowers?

19:47.479 --> 19:49.230
Everything he's doing
is-is in accordance

19:49.272 --> 19:51.066
with ancient protocols.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.400
The Hand of the Mysteries.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.486
It must be presented
in a sacred place.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.237
-That's why he chose this room.
-SATO: Sacred?

19:56.279 --> 19:58.907
They sell "We the People"
shot glasses in the gift shop.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.325
It's symbolic.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.118
This room was built

20:02.160 --> 20:05.955
as a tribute
to the Temple of Vesta in Rome.

20:07.916 --> 20:11.878
There's a purpose
to-to everything he's done.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.177
And everything he's said.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.304
What is it?

20:23.139 --> 20:26.184
"As above, so below."

20:26.226 --> 20:29.854
It's the last thing he said
before he hung up.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.190
I wonder...

20:32.232 --> 20:34.984
-Oh.
-Wait.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.824
There it is.
Roman numerals?

20:40.865 --> 20:43.535
No. As a subtractive notation,
it doesn't work.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.037
-Uh, e-excuse me.
-It could be, uh, an Arabic...

20:46.079 --> 20:47.664
-Not Arabic.
-No?

20:47.706 --> 20:49.124
SATO:
It's a specialty of mine.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.834
If I can just interject
for a quick second...

20:50.875 --> 20:52.293
Well, it actually looks
like a runic variation.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.713
Hey, smart people.
It's upside down.

20:55.505 --> 20:58.967
So it's not 885.
It's S-B-B. Right?

20:59.009 --> 21:01.553
We use that numbering system
here in the Capitol.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.139
Subbasement.
Room 13.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.517
Okay. Let's go.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.811
* *

21:39.424 --> 21:40.884
(drill whirring)

22:05.325 --> 22:07.077
Come on.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.162
(sighs)

22:14.125 --> 22:16.044
Sorry, Dad.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.172
(exhales)

22:34.604 --> 22:37.232
-Aah!
-(Katherine grunts)

22:37.273 --> 22:39.484
(grunting)

22:40.777 --> 22:43.196
What are you doing
in my father's house?

22:44.155 --> 22:46.408
(panting)

22:46.449 --> 22:48.910
CIA?

22:48.952 --> 22:50.453
Your turn.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.747
Let me see some ID.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.792
How's that?

23:03.466 --> 23:06.761
I'm gonna need you to come
with me to the Capitol.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.604
NUÑEZ:
No, Larry. Surprisingly,

23:16.646 --> 23:19.024
the master key
doesn't say "master" on it.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.027
No labels. Just numbers.
Find it.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.905
Okay. Down we go.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.455
(Langdon breathing shakily)

23:33.496 --> 23:35.206
* *

23:35.248 --> 23:37.500
(water dripping)

23:38.585 --> 23:40.962
You good, man? Come on.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.006
* *

23:47.177 --> 23:50.972
We're below sea level, so it
can get pretty wet down here.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.058
Probably why no one
ever comes down anymore.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.643
SATO:
Didn't stop Peter Solomon.
They just told me

23:55.685 --> 23:58.313
room 13 was designated
as his private space.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.148
NUÑEZ:
Oh, this keyhole's

24:00.190 --> 24:03.026
a bit funky.
None of these are gonna work.

24:03.068 --> 24:05.612
(keys jangling)

24:05.653 --> 24:07.072
(Nuñez grunting)

24:08.782 --> 24:10.867
LANGDON:
Hang on.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.787
This sconce.

24:13.828 --> 24:17.248
Sprigs of acacia.

24:17.290 --> 24:21.127
Masons consider it
a symbol of immortality.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.213
* *

24:36.559 --> 24:38.228
(lock clicks)

24:44.234 --> 24:47.696
(door creaks)

25:00.750 --> 25:03.670
SATO:
Do you have any idea
what Peter would have been doing

25:03.712 --> 25:04.921
down here?

25:04.963 --> 25:06.715
NUÑEZ:
What's that smell?

25:06.756 --> 25:08.883
Sulfur.

25:17.267 --> 25:21.062
SATO: Maybe you don't know Peter
as well as you thought.

25:40.290 --> 25:43.376
These bones look human.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.462
They are.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.047
Uh-huh.

25:47.088 --> 25:51.426
And this book, it's bound
in human flesh or what?

25:51.468 --> 25:52.761
It's just a Bible.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.804
This isn't
some sacrificial altar.

25:54.846 --> 25:58.683
It's a Masonic Chamber
of Reflection.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.435
-Hmm.
-Meant to be a place

26:00.477 --> 26:04.189
to come and reflect
on one's own mortality.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.108
-With some dude's femur?
-That any stranger

26:07.150 --> 26:08.943
than chanting
before a four-armed elephant

26:08.985 --> 26:12.322
or praying at the feet
of a man nailed to a cross?

26:18.244 --> 26:20.955
-SATO: Something wrong?
-LANGDON: This symbol. The...

26:20.997 --> 26:23.249
The Leviathan Cross.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.586
It's incongruous.
It shouldn't be here.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.796
What about this?

26:27.837 --> 26:29.923
LANGDON:
"VITRIOL."

26:29.964 --> 26:31.424
It's an acronym.
How's your Latin?

26:31.466 --> 26:34.344
Not as good as my Arabic,
better than my German.

26:34.386 --> 26:37.180
"Visita interiora terrae

26:37.222 --> 26:40.392
rectificando invenies
occultum lapidem."

26:40.433 --> 26:43.228
"Visit the interior
of the Earth,

26:43.269 --> 26:46.606
and, purifying it,
you will find a dark stone."

26:46.648 --> 26:49.693
Hidden stone, technically.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.653
(faint creaking)

26:51.695 --> 26:53.238
SATO:
Do you know what it means?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.116
LANGDON:
It's a Masonic mantra.

26:56.157 --> 27:00.370
"Purifying it,
you will find the hidden stone."

27:13.466 --> 27:14.884
(chuckles softly)

27:14.926 --> 27:16.386
(creaking)

27:20.265 --> 27:22.892
Did you happen to put that key
back in the sconce?

27:22.934 --> 27:24.352
You-you mean this?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.521
No, no one told me
to put it back.

27:26.563 --> 27:27.605
Maybe we should hurry.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.357
Uh, in alchemy,

27:29.399 --> 27:33.111
the first purification
is dissolution,

27:33.153 --> 27:36.364
represented by the dissolving
of calcifications.

27:36.406 --> 27:39.242
These letters
are calcifications.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.369
It's salt.

27:44.289 --> 27:47.375
(stone scrapes)

27:49.377 --> 27:51.004
The wall.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.505
LANGDON:
I know, it's remarkable.

27:52.547 --> 27:53.673
No, the wall!

27:53.715 --> 27:56.009
I-I think it's moving.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.181
LANGDON:
These aren't just letters.
They're handles.

28:01.222 --> 28:04.017
(rumbling)

28:07.312 --> 28:09.898
-(grunts) Damn it,
I can't get it.
-Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.776
We're okay. Hurry, please.

28:14.402 --> 28:15.528
Oh!

28:16.529 --> 28:17.947
Oh, man.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.866
That's not... That's not
gonna hold. We got to go.

28:20.617 --> 28:21.993
Watch out. Watch out.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.912
Hurry up. Come on!
What we waiting for?!

28:23.953 --> 28:25.830
(Sato grunting)

28:29.668 --> 28:31.419
LANGDON:
Whoa.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.004
Whoa, whoa.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.340
(Sato panting)

28:53.191 --> 28:55.360
SATO:
Come on, let's go.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.117
-NUÑEZ: Come on!
-(Sato grunts)

29:02.909 --> 29:04.285
NUÑEZ:
Langdon!

29:04.327 --> 29:06.830
SATO:
One step at a time. Come on!

29:06.871 --> 29:08.331
NUÑEZ:
Are you kidding me right now?!

29:08.373 --> 29:09.958
-Come on!
-SATO: You've got this. Come on!

29:10.000 --> 29:11.126
-Let's go!
-NUÑEZ: Take a step.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.293
Come on.
Just keep going forward.

29:12.335 --> 29:15.213
Langdon! Langdon!

29:15.255 --> 29:17.966
-SATO: Langdon, come on!
-NUÑEZ: Snap out of it!

29:18.008 --> 29:20.135
-(breathing shakily)
-(water dripping)

29:26.182 --> 29:29.144
SATO:
Come on!

29:30.353 --> 29:31.980
(Langdon panting)

29:51.750 --> 29:55.003
-(Nuñez panting)
-(Sato coughs)

30:07.349 --> 30:09.392
* *

30:21.488 --> 30:24.866
I used a common
Masonic decryption key,

30:24.908 --> 30:28.036
and the, uh, resulting cleartext
is, to use a technical term,

30:28.078 --> 30:29.996
gibberish.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.374
Well,
maybe your decryption's off.

30:32.415 --> 30:33.667
No.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.378
I think it's a segmented cipher.

30:36.419 --> 30:39.881
When the Greeks wanted to store
secret information,

30:39.923 --> 30:42.175
they inscribed it on a tablet,

30:42.217 --> 30:44.219
then shattered it into pieces,

30:44.260 --> 30:46.221
storing each piece
in a separate location.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.098
Only when the pieces
were gathered together

30:48.139 --> 30:50.266
could the secret be understood.

30:50.308 --> 30:52.560
Which would explain
why the top is missing.

30:52.602 --> 30:54.104
The capstone
could complete the message.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.189
In theory.

31:01.069 --> 31:03.279
Why are you here?

31:06.241 --> 31:07.742
You said before that, uh,

31:07.784 --> 31:11.246
maybe I didn't know Peter
as well as I thought.

31:12.455 --> 31:15.458
Was he working for the CIA?

31:16.459 --> 31:17.794
No.

31:17.836 --> 31:19.462
(phone vibrates)

31:20.255 --> 31:21.965
LANGDON:
It's him.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.633
Hang on.

31:24.592 --> 31:28.388
-Go.
-Just like we talked about.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.056
Hello?

31:30.098 --> 31:31.766
MAN:
What have you found?

31:31.808 --> 31:33.268
Um, I'll tell you,

31:33.309 --> 31:35.061
but first, I-I want to know
that Peter's okay.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.855
I want proof that he's alive.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.399
Oh, he's alive.
But,

31:39.441 --> 31:42.444
by any measure,
in great distress.

31:42.485 --> 31:45.196
You expect me
to just accept that?

31:45.238 --> 31:49.075
I expect you to focus
on what you can control,

31:49.117 --> 31:52.328
which is whether
he lives or dies.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.960
There's a small granite pyramid.

31:59.002 --> 32:03.173
Contains a numerical grid.

32:03.214 --> 32:05.050
But if this is your, uh, portal,

32:05.091 --> 32:08.386
then I'm afraid
I got some bad news.

32:08.428 --> 32:09.971
I'll be the judge of that.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.307
Any deciphering of the grid

32:12.349 --> 32:14.642
would require further context.

32:14.684 --> 32:17.187
The capstone.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.858
You didn't think
it was gonna be that easy,

32:21.900 --> 32:23.860
did you?

32:23.902 --> 32:26.863
We have more work to do, Robert.

32:26.905 --> 32:28.531
Find it.

32:28.573 --> 32:31.826
I-I-I wouldn't know
where to start.

32:31.868 --> 32:34.204
Well, this is the journey.

32:34.245 --> 32:37.040
And it's just begun.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.461
Got the trace.
Three miles away.

32:41.503 --> 32:44.005
-Let's go.
-We're on our way.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.507
Not you.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.425
I'm not gonna just sit here.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.844
You're the only expert we have.
I need you safe and secure.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.180
Sounds like a nice way of saying
I'm not allowed to leave.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.766
-You're not.
-Hey. Hey. Hey!

32:54.808 --> 32:57.394
* *

33:03.483 --> 33:05.527
NUÑEZ:
Hey, man. They didn't have oat.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.237
Soy okay?

33:07.278 --> 33:11.074
(sighs)
Guess it'll have to be.

33:29.217 --> 33:31.428
-Thanks.
-Yep.

33:32.887 --> 33:35.098
Look...

33:35.140 --> 33:37.392
I know you want to get out there

33:37.434 --> 33:39.227
and help find your friend,

33:39.269 --> 33:43.940
but I think
CIA lady's pretty capable.

33:44.691 --> 33:48.194
I think there's something
she's not telling us.

33:48.236 --> 33:51.322
(sighs)

33:52.115 --> 33:55.326
It's a "need to know" world,
man.

33:56.786 --> 33:58.538
(sighs)

33:58.580 --> 34:00.582
I did two tours in the desert.

34:00.623 --> 34:03.376
I'm still waiting
for someone to tell me why.

34:04.836 --> 34:06.880
They like their secrets.

34:14.846 --> 34:16.890
Yes, they do.

34:19.559 --> 34:22.604
All this talk about a portal,

34:22.645 --> 34:25.774
that's what Peter was to me.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.276
A gateway.

34:28.318 --> 34:31.613
To books. To-to art.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.531
Myth.

34:34.491 --> 34:35.909
You think you know everything,

34:35.950 --> 34:38.411
then you meet someone
who actually does?

34:38.453 --> 34:42.207
It's, uh, it's-it's humbling.

34:44.459 --> 34:46.252
And it could be hard.

34:46.294 --> 34:49.464
He'd push me to open my mind,

34:49.506 --> 34:53.301
appreciate points of view
that I found...

34:55.053 --> 34:57.514
...unsupportable.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.690
PETER:
Good evening.

35:06.731 --> 35:08.400
Oh, hey.

35:08.441 --> 35:10.652
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh...

35:10.694 --> 35:12.946
I'm sure we're all relieved
that I did.

35:12.987 --> 35:15.115
(chuckles): Oh, no.
No, no, no, no. We were... We...

35:15.156 --> 35:17.617
-Dad, what are you doing
in here by yourself?
-Okay.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.744
-Working on the notes
for my lecture.
-You're hiding

35:19.786 --> 35:20.829
from your guests.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.872
Hiding from
your mother's guests.

35:22.914 --> 35:26.167
Sorry to disturb you.
Uh, we should probably...

35:26.209 --> 35:27.669
I'm happy you did,

35:27.711 --> 35:29.838
'cause I actually wanted
to ask you about these notes,

35:29.879 --> 35:32.590
and your thoughts always
change things for the better.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.343
-Uh...
-(laughs) Okay, you know what?

35:35.385 --> 35:37.846
I'm gonna get us a drink. Um...

35:37.887 --> 35:39.305
Dad? Scotch?

35:39.347 --> 35:40.932
I'm good, Katie.
Thank you.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.936
I thank the gods

35:44.978 --> 35:47.564
I had the good taste
to introduce you two.

35:47.605 --> 35:48.982
Katherine would
probably call it fate.

35:49.024 --> 35:53.903
Or the immutable reality
of the Akashic Field.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.032
You don't believe
in that kind of thing, do you?

35:57.073 --> 35:58.575
God, no.

35:58.616 --> 36:00.160
But you do believe in Katherine?

36:00.952 --> 36:03.038
The worst thing you can do
if you love someone

36:03.079 --> 36:06.791
is to give them reason
to doubt themselves.

36:06.833 --> 36:10.378
Our partners. Our family.
These are people we lean on

36:10.420 --> 36:12.839
because these are
people we trust

36:12.881 --> 36:15.383
and who trust in us

36:15.425 --> 36:17.552
no matter what.

36:19.012 --> 36:22.015
I guess I-I never had that.

36:22.057 --> 36:23.767
You have it now.

36:27.062 --> 36:29.773
Yeah, he never gave up on me.

36:32.567 --> 36:36.321
(sighs)
I can't give up on him.

36:42.952 --> 36:44.996
* *

36:59.344 --> 37:01.054
(grunts)

37:07.310 --> 37:09.521
SATO:
Solomon's phone.

37:11.314 --> 37:13.942
-Goodness.
-SOJANI: Okay. So,

37:13.983 --> 37:15.443
the statue's a symbol.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.278
That's how
this guy works, right?

37:17.320 --> 37:19.114
Like with the fresco
at the Capitol?

37:19.155 --> 37:20.782
It's not about the statue.

37:20.824 --> 37:23.451
It's about the inscription.

37:23.493 --> 37:28.415
"Mundus vult decipi
ergo decipiatur."

37:29.499 --> 37:31.751
"The world wants to be deceived,

37:31.793 --> 37:34.671
so let it be deceived."

37:34.713 --> 37:36.715
Deceived.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.174
Well, that sounds like

37:38.216 --> 37:41.052
we brought everyone
out here for nothing.

37:43.346 --> 37:46.307
Almost everyone.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.893
Get Simmons on the phone.

37:48.935 --> 37:50.979
(phone vibrates)

37:53.189 --> 37:56.151
-Yeah.
-(speaking indistinctly)

37:56.192 --> 37:58.028
Oh, it's all quiet over here.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.739
Yeah, we are secure.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.699
Okay.

38:04.117 --> 38:06.036
* *

38:35.440 --> 38:37.901
* *

38:46.409 --> 38:49.079
(Nuñez breathing raggedly)

38:50.622 --> 38:52.165
Whoa.
Why are you doing this?

38:52.207 --> 38:55.377
Mal'akh needs you free of here
to find the portal.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.420
Mal'akh.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.673
JANITOR:
Take that and go.

39:00.674 --> 39:03.468
He'll be in touch.

39:06.930 --> 39:09.391
-He needs help.
-JANITOR: He'll need last rites

39:09.432 --> 39:12.060
if you don't go.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.145
* *

39:20.068 --> 39:22.153
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-DISPATCHER: Officer down.

39:22.195 --> 39:24.239
-Repeat, we have reports
of an officer down.
-OFFICER: Stop!

39:24.280 --> 39:27.242
DISPATCHER:
Can we get EMS Code 3,
East Capitol and First.

39:27.283 --> 39:29.536
-That's coming
from inside the Capitol.
-Stay here.

39:29.577 --> 39:32.288
-What does this have to do
with my dad?
-Just stay here.

39:32.330 --> 39:34.708
-Hey!
-ADAMU: CIA.

39:37.585 --> 39:39.796
(indistinct chatter)

39:53.476 --> 39:55.729
SOJANI:
Still no sign of Langdon.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.523
But we've got everyone looking.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.862
I want to show you something.

40:10.201 --> 40:13.163
You asked about my interest
in this case.

40:13.955 --> 40:15.832
Solomon's kid worked for us?

40:15.874 --> 40:18.668
Briefly.
In Ankara.

40:21.546 --> 40:24.257
Then he got locked up
for trafficking.

40:24.299 --> 40:26.509
(shouts)

40:28.345 --> 40:29.804
Three years ago,

40:29.846 --> 40:31.514
there was a riot in the prison.

40:31.556 --> 40:33.683
(breathing raggedly)

40:37.812 --> 40:41.649
SATO:
Zachary Solomon
was beaten to death.

40:46.696 --> 40:49.074
So, what's the connection?

40:49.115 --> 40:51.868
That's what you're going
to Turkey to find out.

40:59.542 --> 41:01.211
Langdon?

41:06.716 --> 41:08.927
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

41:10.053 --> 41:11.304
Langdon!

41:12.263 --> 41:14.015
Langdon!

41:15.975 --> 41:17.268
Kat.

41:17.310 --> 41:19.688
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?

41:19.729 --> 41:21.022
No, not really.

41:21.064 --> 41:23.441
Where are you going?
What do...

41:23.483 --> 41:25.527
Oh, my God.
Are you...

41:25.568 --> 41:27.195
Is that blood?

41:27.237 --> 41:29.239
It's not mine.

41:30.573 --> 41:33.076
Tell me what's going on.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.871
You're gonna have to trust me.

41:36.913 --> 41:38.832
If I'm gonna help your dad,
I got-I got to go.

41:38.873 --> 41:41.543
-Robert.
-The people who took him

41:41.584 --> 41:43.253
want me to find something.

41:43.294 --> 41:46.965
A... A-An artifact,
a piece of a very old puzzle.

41:47.007 --> 41:49.718
-Then I'll help you.
-No.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.804
They shot two people back there

41:52.846 --> 41:55.640
so I could do this thing alone.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.226
It's... It's not safe.
I got to go.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.020
I have something.

42:00.061 --> 42:03.565
-Katherine.
-Maybe it can help.

42:03.606 --> 42:05.358
(sighs)

42:05.400 --> 42:07.736
What is it?

42:07.777 --> 42:10.488
I don't know,
but Dad said that its secrecy

42:10.530 --> 42:12.323
was more valuable than his life.

42:19.664 --> 42:21.499
He said that?
Those exact words?

42:21.541 --> 42:23.293
Close enough.

42:24.627 --> 42:26.629
He made me promise to destroy it

42:26.671 --> 42:29.090
if anything
ever happened to him.

42:34.304 --> 42:36.973
I'm coming with you.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.033
What is it?

42:55.075 --> 42:57.827
LANGDON:
A Leviathan Cross.

42:59.829 --> 43:02.624
MAL'AKH:
There's been a shift.

43:02.665 --> 43:06.086
A stirring in the atmosphere.

43:06.836 --> 43:09.214
Can you feel it?

43:15.929 --> 43:19.224
Your fate
is in Robert's hands now.

43:19.265 --> 43:22.686
And the fate of mankind,
as well.

43:34.489 --> 43:37.909
Now, hopefully,
he's not a disappointment.

43:39.369 --> 43:40.954
Like your son.

43:42.205 --> 43:46.084
Poor, disappointing Zachary.

43:46.126 --> 43:50.213
You know nothing of my son.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.798
I do, though.

43:54.050 --> 43:58.179
I was there with him in the end.

44:05.812 --> 44:09.065
I was the one who ended him.

44:10.442 --> 44:12.277
* *

44:26.416 --> 44:28.585
SATO:
Langdon, I'm giving you a chance
to come out on your own

44:28.626 --> 44:30.712
or I'm sending someone else
in after you.

44:30.754 --> 44:32.005
-(hangs up)
-Robert?

44:32.047 --> 44:34.257
Well, you just hung up
on the CIA.

44:35.592 --> 44:38.094
I've been friends with Peter
for 30 years.

44:38.136 --> 44:40.388
He was the one who brought me
into the group.

44:40.430 --> 44:43.058
The Leviathan Group
was formed based on

44:43.099 --> 44:46.936
a belief that the ancient wisdom
unlocked hidden power.

44:46.978 --> 44:48.646
And what would happen
if this power

44:48.688 --> 44:50.106
fell into the wrong hands?

44:50.148 --> 44:52.233
LANGDON:
And you think Peter
would die to keep

44:52.275 --> 44:54.569
-that secret?
-Be careful.

44:54.611 --> 44:57.280
We wouldn't be here
if had any other options.

44:57.322 --> 44:59.908
You were right about Sato.
There's something she's hiding.

44:59.949 --> 45:01.368
Do what you do best.

45:01.409 --> 45:02.952
(grunting)

45:04.287 --> 45:05.955
LANGDON:
Only way to get Peter back

45:05.997 --> 45:09.084
is to find the capstone,
give Mal'akh what he wants.

45:09.125 --> 45:11.002
Time is running out.
We have to finish this.

45:11.044 --> 45:14.297
-Or my dad is dead.
-MAL'AKH: Death will be
a blessing for him.

45:14.339 --> 45:16.508
* *

45:17.967 --> 45:18.093
You're in my world now.
