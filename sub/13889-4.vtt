00:51.665 --> 00:54.600
Have you found a way to get us out of here?

00:54.768 --> 01:00.400
<i>I have, actually. I've devoted all my run-time</i>
<i>to looking for a loophole in the prison regs,</i>

01:00.574 --> 01:04.977
<i>and I've found something which means you</i>
<i>can serve your two-year sentence</i>

01:05.144 --> 01:06.703
<i>in just 14 weeks.</i>

01:06.880 --> 01:08.370
What have I got to do?

01:08.548 --> 01:10.948
<i>Become a dog.</i>

01:15.355 --> 01:18.188
- A dog?
- <i>According to my data banks,</i>

01:18.358 --> 01:21.623
<i>dog years are seven times shorter</i>
<i>than human years.</i>

01:22.796 --> 01:26.232
<i>You can't fault that plan on its mathematics.</i>

01:26.400 --> 01:29.164
Maybe you can fault it on the fact I'm not a dog.

01:29.336 --> 01:33.466
<i>According to a 20th-century newspaper</i>
<i>called "The National Enquirer",</i>

01:33.640 --> 01:35.870
<i>the operation's straightforward.</i>

01:38.211 --> 01:40.645
<i>A roverostomy, they call it.</i>

01:42.549 --> 01:45.347
<i>Here's a photograph</i>
<i>of a bloke who had it done.</i>

01:48.789 --> 01:50.279
That's a dog!

01:50.457 --> 01:52.721
<i>See how convincing it is?</i>

01:52.893 --> 01:55.020
<i>Even you're fooled.</i>

01:55.729 --> 02:01.224
Become a dog. That is the crappiest, most
pathetic plan you've come up with all week.

02:01.401 --> 02:04.734
<i>Give me a chance</i> - <i>it's only Monday.</i>

02:05.372 --> 02:07.272
(BEEP)

02:11.411 --> 02:14.938
What happened to my life -
career, prospects, friends?

02:15.115 --> 02:18.016
I had it all and threw it away. It's a tragedy.

02:18.185 --> 02:20.415
What? You had none of that stuff.

02:20.587 --> 02:23.556
You're right. I had none of that stuff.

02:23.723 --> 02:27.124
I had absolutely nothing and I threw it all away.

02:27.294 --> 02:29.194
It's an even bigger tragedy.

02:29.362 --> 02:33.025
We'll only get through this
by being positive, by being...

02:33.200 --> 02:37.830
What did women tennis players reckon
was so important - begins with C?

02:38.004 --> 02:40.495
Cunnilingus?

02:42.909 --> 02:46.572
Centred. By being centred, focused.

02:46.746 --> 02:50.842
It's only two years. With good behaviour,
it could be 18 months.

02:51.017 --> 02:54.976
Remember you were born,
then you were 18 months? It flashed past.

02:58.525 --> 03:04.361
That's 'cause you had two breasts big as
your head at your beck and call day and night.

03:07.367 --> 03:10.200
Give me that now, and I wouldn't be whinging.

03:15.242 --> 03:19.144
- What's this?
- Canary outfits and first meeting information.

03:22.916 --> 03:24.884
I volunteered for the Canaries.

03:25.051 --> 03:28.612
- Some bloke came round so I signed up.
- For the Canaries?

03:28.788 --> 03:33.782
Yeah. You should see the list of privileges
you get. It's unbelievable.

03:33.960 --> 03:38.829
- You don't know what the Canaries are.
- It's a singing troop. A cappella.

03:38.999 --> 03:41.832
<i>(SINGS) You are the sunshine of my life</i>

03:42.002 --> 03:43.560
<i>Ooh</i>

03:43.737 --> 03:47.298
<i>That's why I'll always be around...</i>

03:53.046 --> 03:57.676
They're nothing to do with singing, are they?
Holly lied to me, didn't he?

03:57.851 --> 03:59.284
He was taking the smeg!

03:59.452 --> 04:02.387
Oh, Listy.

04:03.590 --> 04:06.457
Listy, Listy, Listy.

04:06.626 --> 04:09.322
Well, go on, then. What have I signed up for?

04:10.230 --> 04:16.065
In the 19th century, when miners went down
a pit, they'd lower a canary down first in a cage.

04:16.236 --> 04:19.171
What, and make 'em do some mining?

04:20.040 --> 04:23.203
They were sick
in the 19th century, weren't they?

04:23.376 --> 04:25.776
How much coal can a little canary get?

04:25.946 --> 04:29.848
And if the atmosphere was noxious,
guess what the canary did?

04:30.016 --> 04:31.984
Complained to the foreman?

04:33.720 --> 04:35.711
It died, Listy.

04:35.889 --> 04:41.418
The canary's job was to go into the most
dangerous, unpleasant and smeggy situations,

04:41.595 --> 04:47.556
and see if it could stay alive, then they'd know
if it was safe to send in the important people.

04:47.734 --> 04:51.636
- I'm gonna kill him!
- How come you've not heard of the Canaries?

04:51.805 --> 04:56.071
Recruitment posters are all over the bogs.
Haven't you seen them?

04:56.242 --> 05:00.269
When I'm in the men's toilets in prison,
I tend not to look around.

05:02.282 --> 05:05.274
It's like playing golf. I concentrate on me grip,

05:05.452 --> 05:08.888
keep me eye on the ball,
and try not to veer off to the side.

05:10.757 --> 05:14.318
The Canaries. Do you know
what it's supposed to stand for?

05:14.494 --> 05:18.658
"Convict Army Nearly All Retarded
Inbred Evil Sheepshaggers."

05:20.600 --> 05:25.401
(LAUGHS) They haven't got an X chromosome
to share between them!

05:25.572 --> 05:27.005
Smeg!

05:27.173 --> 05:30.040
- It gets worse as well.
- Worse? Go on.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.734
I signed you up, too.

05:38.385 --> 05:42.253
I forged your signature.
I thought I was doing you a favour.

05:42.956 --> 05:44.890
- Me? Why?
- I've signed us all up.

05:45.492 --> 05:47.824
- Kryten, Kris. Everyone.
- No way.

05:47.994 --> 05:50.462
No way am I becoming a Canary.

05:53.466 --> 05:55.866
It's a great honour for floor 13,

05:56.036 --> 06:01.804
for today we are visited by Captain Hollister,
who has a special assignment.

06:01.975 --> 06:03.909
At last some action!

06:04.077 --> 06:09.481
I've been going mental. All this time,
cooped up, not killing nothing. Yes!

06:09.649 --> 06:11.583
Kill Crazy, shut up, yer punk!

06:13.553 --> 06:14.884
OK. Listen up.

06:15.055 --> 06:19.754
We've located a ship, the SSS Silverbird,
buried at the bottom of an ocean moon.

06:19.926 --> 06:23.054
Remote probe has come back
with no signs of a crew.

06:23.229 --> 06:26.596
No bodily remains, no skeletons - zip.

06:26.766 --> 06:31.032
We want you guys to go onboard
and find out why.

06:32.872 --> 06:35.670
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.

06:35.842 --> 06:39.710
<i>You are the sunshine of my life</i>

06:39.879 --> 06:41.437
<i>Ooh</i>

06:41.614 --> 06:45.106
<i>That's why I'll always be around</i>

06:45.285 --> 06:46.684
Rimmer!

06:46.853 --> 06:51.950
Sorry, sir. We appear to be in the wrong
hobby group. We'll leave immediately. Go!

06:52.826 --> 06:55.954
This is where you're staying. Now get on with it.

06:56.129 --> 06:59.257
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You heard the warden.

06:59.432 --> 07:02.265
He wants you to get on with it. From the top.

07:02.435 --> 07:06.064
<i>You are the sunshine of my life...</i>

07:06.239 --> 07:07.638
Rimmer!

07:10.043 --> 07:11.977
Sorry, sir. I thought you...

07:12.145 --> 07:16.707
Shut up! You're a member of the toughest
combat army this side of Pluto.

07:16.883 --> 07:20.148
I've seen custard factories less yellow
than you are!

07:20.320 --> 07:24.017
- Start behaving like a man.
- A man, sir?

07:24.190 --> 07:26.624
Yes, of course, sir. A man.

07:27.627 --> 07:32.064
A man? Perhaps if you could just remind me,
I am sure it will all come back.

07:32.232 --> 07:34.826
(CRUNCHING)

07:40.473 --> 07:42.464
Continue, Captain.

07:43.376 --> 07:44.809
(RATTLING)

07:47.313 --> 07:50.942
It's inconceivable the ship
was sent out without a crew,

07:51.117 --> 07:54.484
so whatever devoured the crew, bones and all,

07:54.654 --> 07:56.019
might still be there,

07:56.189 --> 07:58.123
so be careful.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.452
Let's go kill something!

08:00.627 --> 08:03.323
Yes!

08:15.708 --> 08:21.078
I hope it's got like big teeth and claws
and like loads of heads. Great!

08:37.831 --> 08:41.392
Here we go at last. Yeah!

08:56.049 --> 08:59.018
OK. Stay together. Keep 'em peeled.

08:59.185 --> 09:00.516
What's that?

09:00.687 --> 09:04.418
- (KRYTEN) Where?
- It's shaking from side to side like a leaf.

09:04.591 --> 09:06.923
I think that's your shadow, sir.

09:07.994 --> 09:10.792
Located the mainframe.
Maybe it can tell us something.

09:15.368 --> 09:20.328
<i>Good evening, Arnold. I've been looking</i>
<i>forward to your arrival so very much.</i>

09:20.506 --> 09:23.907
- How do you know my name?
- <i>My name is Cassandra.</i>

09:24.077 --> 09:27.535
<i>I am a computer with the ability</i>
<i>to predict the future</i>

09:27.714 --> 09:30.308
<i>with an accuracy rating of 100 per cent.</i>

09:30.483 --> 09:31.780
<i>Bless you.</i>

09:31.951 --> 09:34.010
Bless you? What do you mean?

09:34.187 --> 09:35.984
A-choo!

09:36.155 --> 09:41.457
<i>Kris has a tissue in her pocket. She says,</i>
<i>"Would you like this?" You say, "Thanks."</i>

09:41.628 --> 09:43.892
- Would you like this?
- Thanks.

09:44.631 --> 09:47.600
- <i>Extraordinaryl</i>
- Extraordinary!

09:47.767 --> 09:50.600
<i>The questions we can askl It tells the future.</i>

09:50.770 --> 09:53.466
The questions we can ask! It tells the future.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.768
<i>How does it work?</i>
<i>The future's not happened yet.</i>

09:57.610 --> 09:59.578
I wasn't going to say that.

09:59.746 --> 10:02.715
- <i>I never said you would...</i>
- But how does it work?

10:02.882 --> 10:06.147
- The future's not happened yet.
- <i>... although you do.</i>

10:06.319 --> 10:08.184
Smeg!

10:09.088 --> 10:12.615
Let's ask her a question about the future.
A biggie.

10:12.792 --> 10:16.592
Cassandra, do we ever get back to earth?
Have humans survived?

10:16.763 --> 10:19.527
Do I ever find my singing tie pin?

10:21.634 --> 10:24.262
Do we want to know about the future?

10:24.437 --> 10:27.338
Do we want to know how and when we die?

10:27.507 --> 10:33.446
Kris is right. Something like that could mess
your life up for ever. I have a question.

10:33.613 --> 10:36.844
<i>I know, Arnold. I know</i>
<i>the rest of this conversation.</i>

10:37.016 --> 10:38.347
So what's the answer?

10:38.518 --> 10:43.683
<i>He chokes to death aged 181,</i>
<i>trying to remove a bra with his teeth.</i>

10:46.225 --> 10:47.658
What was the question?

10:47.827 --> 10:49.920
I just asked how you died.

10:50.930 --> 10:53.797
You what? I don't wanna know that.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.697
- Whose bra?
- 181?

10:56.869 --> 10:58.860
Probably your own.

11:01.040 --> 11:06.740
Come on, though. Taking a bra off with me teeth
at 181. That's a hell of a sexy way to go!

11:07.814 --> 11:11.045
So long as the teeth are in your mouth
at the time, sir.

11:12.852 --> 11:16.982
I'm really screwed up now. I never wanted
to know that - know how I die.

11:17.156 --> 11:20.148
It's completely spoilt the surprise!

11:20.326 --> 11:24.592
<i>Kryten, this is where you share your theory</i>
<i>with your crewmates.</i>

11:24.764 --> 11:28.894
I have a theory. The Silverbird didn't crash,
did it, Cassandra?

11:29.068 --> 11:33.528
The ship was sent here by the Space Corps
on autopilot to get rid of you -

11:33.706 --> 11:37.142
to abandon you at the bottom
of a lunar sea in deep space.

11:37.310 --> 11:40.245
That's brilliant, bud! How did you work that out?

11:40.413 --> 11:43.610
I read it on this mission directive here.

11:47.987 --> 11:52.549
So, there was no dead bodies on board
because there was no crew.

11:52.725 --> 11:55.023
A computer that predicts the future...

11:55.194 --> 11:59.460
- <i>... is dangerous indeed.</i>
- Is dangerous... Yes, precisely.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.464
We should be making tracks.

12:03.636 --> 12:07.800
<i>I'm afraid that's not going to happen.</i>
<i>The bulkhead's just given way</i>

12:07.974 --> 12:11.102
<i>and we're shipping water</i>
<i>at 1,000 gallons a second.</i>

12:11.277 --> 12:14.041
<i>All the Canaries will be dead within one hour</i>

12:14.213 --> 12:16.147
- <i>except for Rimmer...</i>
- Yes!

12:16.315 --> 12:18.476
<i>... who will be dead in 20 minutes.</i>

12:24.757 --> 12:28.659
<i>Only Lister, Kryten, the Cat</i>
<i>and Kochanski survive.</i>

12:28.828 --> 12:30.352
What happens to Rimmer?

12:30.530 --> 12:35.058
<i>He has a heart attack brought on</i>
<i>by the stress of knowing he's going to die</i>

12:35.234 --> 12:42.140
<i>and collapses during a conversation with me</i>
<i>in 19 minutes and 31 seconds.</i>

12:42.308 --> 12:45.334
I don't believe you. I simply don't believe you.

12:45.511 --> 12:47.979
<i>We shall see, or rather, YOU shall see.</i>

12:48.147 --> 12:50.411
<i>I have already seen.</i>

12:51.250 --> 12:54.310
The hairs on the back of my neck
are standing on end.

12:54.487 --> 12:59.117
Mine, too, and not just the ones
on the back of my neck - it's one up, all up.

13:02.762 --> 13:07.290
Well, it's not the first time we've been
in a situation like this, is it?

13:07.467 --> 13:11.426
Hell, no. We've drunk coffee thousands of times.

13:11.604 --> 13:13.071
We're veterans.

13:13.239 --> 13:14.934
Future echoes, remember?

13:15.108 --> 13:18.373
- Future echoes - all right!
- What was that?

13:18.544 --> 13:23.345
We learned that if the future's already decided,
you can't change it.

13:23.516 --> 13:27.919
Yeah, but what do you know?
You're a chicken-soup machine repairman,

13:28.087 --> 13:30.521
not Hank Handsome, Space Adventurer.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.754
Don't get ideas above your station,

13:33.926 --> 13:36.326
and your station is Git Central.

13:36.963 --> 13:39.955
I've been surviving in space five, six years.

13:40.133 --> 13:44.627
When it comes to weirdy, paradoxy space stuff,
I bought the T-shirt.

13:45.505 --> 13:48.201
He bought it and I ironed it for him.

13:49.876 --> 13:53.243
- Exactly.
- So, you're saying the future's the future,

13:53.412 --> 13:57.314
and, like your underpants,
the chances of change are remote.

13:58.484 --> 14:00.281
Well, I don't accept it.

14:00.453 --> 14:04.355
- Hey, I'm not happy about it, man.
- None of us are.

14:04.524 --> 14:08.153
You dying is the last thing we want, bud,
especially me.

14:08.327 --> 14:12.024
Hell, I'll probably have to help dig the hole.

14:13.733 --> 14:18.500
So, six years of space adventuring,
six years of experience and knowledge

14:18.671 --> 14:22.437
have led you to the conclusion
that I'm totally stuffed.

14:22.608 --> 14:27.238
Mr Rimmer has a point, sir.
Your greater knowledge makes you pessimistic,

14:27.413 --> 14:32.373
while his ignorance and naivety
keep his mind receptive to a possible solution.

14:32.552 --> 14:34.520
Shut your stupid flat head, you.

14:36.355 --> 14:40.348
So, when you don't know enough
to know that you don't know enough,

14:40.526 --> 14:45.987
there's no fear holding you back - you achieve
things which people with more brains can't.

14:46.165 --> 14:49.032
- Precisely.
- He's got the power of ignorance.

14:49.202 --> 14:54.697
With the ignorance he's got, that makes him
one of the most powerful men that's ever lived.

14:54.874 --> 14:58.469
Harness your stupidity, sir.
Employ your witlessness.

14:58.644 --> 15:02.603
Use your empty-headed simplistic moron mind
and find a solution.

15:03.449 --> 15:06.077
OK. I've got an idea.

15:06.252 --> 15:09.153
Replay our meeting with Cassandra in your CPU,

15:09.322 --> 15:12.814
and tell me if at any point,
anyone ever called me Rimmer.

15:12.992 --> 15:16.393
- What?
- (BEEPING)

15:17.296 --> 15:22.063
At no point did anyone refer to you as Rimmer.
In fact, we barely looked at you.

15:23.369 --> 15:24.734
That's what I thought.

15:24.904 --> 15:29.273
Cassandra said, "Rimmer dies,"
but that doesn't necessarily mean me.

15:29.442 --> 15:33.742
- Who does it mean, then, your dad?
- Cassandra doesn't know the future.

15:33.913 --> 15:35.380
She sees pictures of it.

15:35.548 --> 15:39.985
She could have seen another guy
die of a heart attack who's called Rimmer.

15:40.152 --> 15:42.382
- He's right.
- All I've got to do

15:42.555 --> 15:46.719
is to find someone I can
introduce to Cassandra as Rimmer,

15:46.892 --> 15:50.020
and it will be them that stiffs out and not me.

15:50.196 --> 15:54.189
Such lowlife conniving -
it's impossible not to be impressed!

15:55.001 --> 15:58.698
What I wouldn't give
to have your weasel gene, sir!

16:02.508 --> 16:06.035
- Now, wait a minute.
- Oh, look, here's Mr Knot.

16:07.747 --> 16:11.148
- You made this area secure?
- Yes, sir. Coffee, sir?

16:13.486 --> 16:16.353
We have to inspect the mainframe. Where is it?

16:17.456 --> 16:21.916
Agh! You idiot!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

16:22.094 --> 16:23.425
Please...

16:23.596 --> 16:26.121
Have my jacket. I insist.

16:27.033 --> 16:30.594
Then I shall lead you to Cassandra.
There we are, sir.

16:30.770 --> 16:32.761
A perfect fit, sir.

16:34.173 --> 16:36.607
- Lead on, Rimmer.
- Don't call me Rimmer.

16:36.776 --> 16:40.109
- That's your name.
- But Rimmer is so full of nobility

16:40.279 --> 16:41.576
and quiet courage.

16:41.747 --> 16:43.908
Call me Arsewipe or Fishbreath.

16:44.717 --> 16:46.776
Not Rimmer, sir. Never Rimmer.

16:46.952 --> 16:50.752
OK, Arsewipe, whatever you say.
Now, where's the mainframe?

16:53.993 --> 16:56.325
<i>Hello, Arnold. Bang on time.</i>

16:56.495 --> 16:59.293
I've brought a visitor. Do you know his name?

16:59.465 --> 17:01.865
- <i>Yes, I do... Knot.</i>
- What?

17:02.034 --> 17:03.365
- <i>Knot.</i>
- What?

17:03.536 --> 17:08.838
<i>Let me finish. Not that it matters what his</i>
<i>name is. Our relationship doesn't last very long.</i>

17:09.008 --> 17:13.172
- I understand you have the ability to predict...
- <i>... the future, yes.</i>

17:13.346 --> 17:15.609
- 100 per cent...
- <i>... reliable, yes.</i>

17:17.148 --> 17:21.676
- What happens to me? Do I get back to earth?
- <i>No, you die of a heart attack</i>

17:21.854 --> 17:25.346
<i>after hearing you're going</i>
<i>to die of a heart attack.</i>

17:26.791 --> 17:29.283
You filthy... (GROANS)

17:33.466 --> 17:34.763
- Poor Rimmer.
- <i>Yes, poor old Rimmer.</i>

17:36.369 --> 17:39.702
- My name is Knot...
- Your name is not what?

17:39.872 --> 17:42.238
Knot! Knot! Knot!

17:44.844 --> 17:47.438
- Is he dead now?
- <i>I'm afraid so.</i>

17:47.613 --> 17:49.638
Yes!

17:49.815 --> 17:53.080
<i>He died of a massive coronary,</i>
<i>just as I prophesied.</i>

17:53.252 --> 17:54.549
Yes!

17:54.720 --> 17:58.952
<i>You seem inordinately happy, Arnold, but why?</i>
<i>You're going to die, too.</i>

18:00.793 --> 18:03.956
But you said... I've just...
I'm going to die, too?

18:04.130 --> 18:10.091
<i>I already told you. Rimmer dies of a heart attack,</i>
<i>then you and the other Canaries die, too.</i>

18:10.269 --> 18:14.296
<i>All except Lister, Kryten, Kochanski</i>
<i>and the Cat. I've seen it.</i>

18:14.473 --> 18:18.034
That's as well as maybe,
but you have you seen this?

18:23.048 --> 18:26.984
<i>Yes, I'm afraid I have.</i>

18:29.455 --> 18:35.621
- You were right. There's nothing I can do.
- According to Cassandra, we four survive.

18:35.795 --> 18:40.255
Therefore, while we are here,
we cannot die. Regard.

18:41.233 --> 18:44.464
(GUN DOESN'T FIRE)

18:44.637 --> 18:46.264
Duck, sir.

18:48.207 --> 18:51.335
(BULLET RICOCHETS)

18:51.510 --> 18:52.841
Duck again, sir!

18:54.647 --> 18:56.137
As I thought.

18:57.249 --> 19:01.049
So, in other words, if I...

19:03.722 --> 19:05.781
- What's that for?
- You can't die.

19:05.958 --> 19:09.155
Yeah, but I can still feel pain, you smeghead!

19:10.796 --> 19:16.632
How about we use our powers of invulnerability
which will last until we return to Red Dwarf

19:16.802 --> 19:20.636
and escort Mr Rimmer up to the obs deck
and into the diving bell?

19:43.362 --> 19:45.956
(LISTER) The diving bell. We've made it.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.191
Where did he go?

19:55.608 --> 19:56.905
Yo!

20:06.252 --> 20:09.483
(RUSHING WATER)

20:09.655 --> 20:12.749
- Hear that?
- Water.

20:13.592 --> 20:16.220
Kris, take cover. Water's coming!

20:32.311 --> 20:34.836
Great! Everything above us is flooded

20:35.014 --> 20:39.007
and now we're back down
in the bowels again with Cassandra.

20:39.184 --> 20:41.118
It's coming true.

20:41.287 --> 20:44.313
My death! It's all coming true.

20:52.031 --> 20:56.400
<i>You tried to cheat the future and failed,</i>
<i>as I knew you would.</i>

20:56.569 --> 20:59.504
So what happens now? How?

20:59.672 --> 21:01.139
How do I die?

21:01.307 --> 21:04.105
<i>Lister catches you making love to Kochanski</i>

21:04.276 --> 21:08.713
<i>and shoots you through the head</i>
<i>with a harpoon gun.</i>

21:14.987 --> 21:17.751
Can you just double-check that?

21:17.923 --> 21:21.791
<i>I've seen it. It's what happens</i> -
<i>in the old laundry room.</i>

21:21.961 --> 21:25.021
So let me just repeat what I think you're saying.

21:25.197 --> 21:27.165
Arnold - that's me -

21:27.333 --> 21:32.600
and Kochanski - that's the woman,
the really attractive one you saw earlier -

21:32.771 --> 21:35.433
me and her are in bed giving it rizz...

21:37.109 --> 21:39.976
Lister - the dumpy one
with the stupid haircut -

21:40.145 --> 21:43.945
walks in and shoots me
while I'm making love with Kochanski?

21:44.116 --> 21:46.277
<i>That is what is going to happen.</i>

21:46.452 --> 21:49.478
Fantastic!

22:00.032 --> 22:04.799
- I can't believe what you're telling me.
- I can scarcely believe it myself.

22:06.038 --> 22:09.132
I never thought you'd look at me twice.

22:09.308 --> 22:12.004
Neither did I.

22:12.678 --> 22:18.913
But, apparently, we're gonna make love.
Unbe-smegging-lievable or what?

22:19.084 --> 22:22.781
- It's not warm in here. Fancy a wee nip?
- No.

22:24.757 --> 22:29.387
But why would I want to sleep with you?
It doesn't make sense.

22:29.561 --> 22:31.461
Maybe you get blind-drunk.

22:31.630 --> 22:34.827
That doesn't excuse my other four senses.

22:36.235 --> 22:39.534
Right. Barely an hour to go.
Shall we get started?

22:39.705 --> 22:43.835
I mean, let's face it,
you can't change the future - sadly.

22:44.576 --> 22:47.443
But you said you could.

22:47.613 --> 22:50.207
Yeah, I've changed my mind now.

22:50.749 --> 22:53.616
Shall we play the opera game instead?

22:53.786 --> 22:57.313
Kris, it's what Cassandra saw.
You can't cheat fate.

22:57.489 --> 23:03.621
There's no way on earth that I'm climbing
out of my clothes and clambering into that bed.

23:19.344 --> 23:20.902
My clothes are soaking!

23:21.080 --> 23:24.049
Take them off and dry them on the heater.

23:35.394 --> 23:38.022
It's coming true. It's all coming true.

23:38.197 --> 23:41.030
It's coming true. It's all coming true!

23:49.041 --> 23:51.737
(GROANS)

23:55.647 --> 23:57.638
Bud, you can't go back there.

23:57.816 --> 23:59.784
Cassandra said Kris survives,

23:59.952 --> 24:04.480
and the only way that's gonna happen
is if someone goes back and saves her.

24:04.656 --> 24:06.886
Chuck us that harpoon gun, will ya?

24:16.268 --> 24:18.429
<i>Ba-la-bup-doodle-up-bap!</i>

24:21.840 --> 24:27.801
I'm not sure about this. This is the first time
I've been seduced by predeterminism theory.

24:28.881 --> 24:30.678
One hour exactly.

24:33.118 --> 24:35.348
Bloody buggering hell!

24:37.055 --> 24:40.354
Tonight must be the night
they put the clocks forward!

24:41.493 --> 24:42.858
I've got it.

24:43.028 --> 24:45.019
That's more than I did.

24:45.864 --> 24:47.297
I've worked it all out.

24:47.466 --> 24:52.460
I never get any breaks ever!
20 seconds later, you could have been on top

24:52.638 --> 24:55.539
and I could have used you as a human shield.

24:55.707 --> 25:00.371
I must have been mad. What the hell
was I thinking? I felt sorry for you.

25:00.546 --> 25:04.710
- Shut up and listen to me.
- Why aren't you mad that I'm in bed with him?

25:04.883 --> 25:07.317
'Cause I know why you're in bed with him.

25:07.486 --> 25:11.820
- I also know that I don't kill him.
- Oh, but Cassandra promised.

25:12.591 --> 25:15.822
Cassandra made that up
to force you two together,

25:15.994 --> 25:19.361
so that you'd feel sorry for him
and sleep with him.

25:19.531 --> 25:22.796
- Why did she say she saw it happen?
- To make it happen.

25:22.968 --> 25:25.027
- But why?
- To try and punish me.

25:25.204 --> 25:28.640
- Punish you? Why?
- 'Cause Cassandra has always known

25:28.807 --> 25:30.104
how she dies.

25:30.275 --> 25:34.211
She wants me to suffer for something
that I do in the future.

25:35.147 --> 25:36.478
You kill her.

25:36.648 --> 25:41.210
- She hates you because she knows you kill her.
- That's what this was about.

25:41.386 --> 25:42.910
Kryten figured it out.

25:43.488 --> 25:46.924
Kryten figured it out, did he? Good old Kryten (!)

25:48.327 --> 25:51.922
But did he really have to figure it out
quite so damn fast?

25:52.831 --> 25:57.131
Would it have killed him to take
30 minutes longer? Ten minutes even?

25:57.803 --> 25:59.794
Two would have done.

26:00.772 --> 26:03.240
I'm gonna take care of the rest of it now.

26:03.408 --> 26:06.605
I'll see you two lovebirds later.

26:07.913 --> 26:11.178
Look... Thanks for being with me tonight.

26:11.350 --> 26:15.719
I can't think of anyone I'd rather share
my final hour with than you.

26:15.888 --> 26:18.049
I really mean that.

26:18.991 --> 26:23.587
I'm not all bad. In fact, sometimes,
I'm quite sweet and sensitive.

26:23.762 --> 26:25.753
Bye.

26:25.931 --> 26:27.330
By the way...

26:28.033 --> 26:30.024
Is it OK if I keep these?

26:37.576 --> 26:40.977
If the future's all worked out -
horoscopes and stuff -

26:41.146 --> 26:43.979
it means we're not responsible for what we do.

26:44.149 --> 26:48.142
We're actors saying lines in a script
written by somebody else.

26:48.320 --> 26:54.054
I don't want to believe that. I want to believe
I'm in charge of me own life. Me own destiny.

26:54.226 --> 26:58.993
So I'm not gonna kill you, Cassandra.
I'm out of here.

26:59.164 --> 27:01.655
<i>But you DO kill me. I've seen it.</i>

27:01.833 --> 27:06.861
Tomorrow's a new day - a fresh page
in a book that's not been written yet.

27:07.039 --> 27:09.439
What happens in the future is up to me,

27:09.608 --> 27:12.509
not some predetermined-destiny smeg.

27:12.678 --> 27:14.509
I'll see you, kiddo.

27:49.881 --> 27:51.644
Smeg.

27:53.785 --> 27:57.346
<i>It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:57.522 --> 28:00.753
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

28:00.926 --> 28:04.054
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

28:04.229 --> 28:07.027
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:07.199 --> 28:10.635
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:10.802 --> 28:13.100
<i>I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

28:14.306 --> 28:17.332
<i>Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

28:17.509 --> 28:20.876
<i>Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

28:21.046 --> 28:23.640
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:23.815 --> 28:27.478
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:27.652 --> 28:30.212
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:30.389 --> 28:34.485
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>
