L.A. WAS GOOD?

04:00.501 --> 04:02.938
YEAH.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.548
IT WAS FINE.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.302
DID I JUST WITNESS
ANOTHER EPISODE

OF "THE DA-MONE

04:21.348 --> 04:23.045

04:23.088 --> 04:24.220
NATE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.613
I WANTED TO CHECK ON YOU.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.136
SINCE YOU GOT BACK,
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE

04:27.179 --> 04:29.356
RIHANNA'S NEXT ALBUM:
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

04:29.399 --> 04:32.837
WELL, BETWEEN
STUDYING FOR MIDTERMS,
WORK, AND PRACTICING

04:32.881 --> 04:34.404
FOR THE PROFESSIONAL
QUALIFYING
TENNIS TOURNAMENT,

04:34.448 --> 04:35.927
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.582
SIMONE, THIS "I'M FINE
WITH THE BREAK-UP" ACT

04:38.626 --> 04:40.105
ISN'T A GOOD LOOK.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.455
WELL, I HAVE OTHER
THINGS TO FOCUS ON

04:41.498 --> 04:43.979
OTHER THAN
MY BREAK-UP, NATE.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.589
WHEN NICO AND I SPLIT,

04:45.633 --> 04:47.417
I THOUGHT I COULD JUST GO
THROUGH THE MOTIONS

04:47.461 --> 04:49.593
AND THE PAIN WILL
GO AWAY ON ITS OWN.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.378
BUT THAT AIN'T THE TRUTH.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.467
LIFE IS LIKE A TAPE.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.338
YOU CAN'T FAST-FORWARD
THROUGH THE HURT.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.340
YOU HAVE TO LET
THE TAPE PLAY,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.908
OR THE BAD'S GONNA
KEEP ON REPEATING.

05:01.431 --> 05:04.869
OK. WELL, THANK YOU FOR
THE ADVICE, BUT I'M FINE.

05:04.913 --> 05:07.219

05:12.094 --> 05:13.617
ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU ALL
NEXT WEEK.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.667
THAT WAS QUITE
THE TURNOUT.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.800
MY STUDENTS KNOW BETTER
THAN TO MISS MY MIDTERMS.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.976
IF I RECALL, YOU HAD
TO LEARN THAT THE HARD WAY.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.891
SEE, THAT WAS
PAST RALPH.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.676
WELL, WHAT BRINGS
PRESENT RALPH BACK?

05:28.719 --> 05:31.113
I'M WRITING A STORY
ON TERRY TUCKER

05:31.156 --> 05:32.941
AND THE P.E.D. SCANDAL
IN THE MAJORS,

05:32.984 --> 05:34.856
AND I THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE USEFUL

05:34.899 --> 05:36.379
TO GET THE PERSPECTIVE
OF A FORMER TEAMMATE.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.120
-YOU MEAN MARCUS.
-MM-HMM.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.991
AND YOU THINK BECAUSE
I KNOW HIM,

05:40.035 --> 05:41.776
I COULD TALK HIM INTO
GIVING YOU AN INTERVIEW.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.734
WELL, IT'S HARDER FOR
THE SOURCE TO SAY NO

05:43.778 --> 05:46.433
WHEN THE REQUEST
COMES FROM SOMEONE
THAT THEY TRUST.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.260
-I TAUGHT YOU THAT TRICK.
-HAS IT WORKED?

05:48.304 --> 05:50.175
SORRY. I MEAN, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO SEEK HIM OUT

05:50.219 --> 05:51.699
ALL BY YOURSELF.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.222
ALL GOOD. IT WAS
WORTH A SHOT.

05:53.265 --> 05:56.007
THIS COULD'VE BEEN
A PHONE CALL, RALPH.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.400
OH, I KNOW.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.664
ALSO, I WANTED
TO STOP BY IN PERSON

06:00.708 --> 06:03.014
AND GET AN UPDATE
ON THE BRINGSTON
FINANCIAL STORY.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.539
UNFORTUNATELY,
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.845
I'VE BEEN DISTRACTED BY
VERONICA SKINNER.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.934
NOT ONLY DID SHE
TRY TO GET ME FIRED,

06:09.978 --> 06:12.589
BUT HER REASONS FOR
BEING AT BRINGSTON ARE
A LITTLE SUSPECT.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.417
OK, WELL, I GET IT.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.376
BUT WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE

06:16.419 --> 06:18.421

06:18.465 --> 06:20.684

THE LATEST BOARD MEETING.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.688

IN THEM THAT'LL BE USEFUL.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.168

06:55.371 --> 06:57.242
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.070
I WASN'T ACTUALLY
MAD AT YOU.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.464
I WAS JUST DEALING WITH
MY PTSD FROM KEVIN

07:01.508 --> 07:05.990
AND TOOK IT OUT ON YOU,
BUT ALL GOOD NOW.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.471

MONTHS AGO.

07:20.222 --> 07:23.443

07:50.992 --> 07:53.385

BUT I'M NOT MAD AT IT.

WASN'T AWFUL.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.502
WELL, YOU WOULD
ONLY KNOW THAT IF
YOU CAME TO MY GAME.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.853
SO I DIDN'T KNOW

09:09.897 --> 09:11.725
OH. SLOW DOWN,
BIG GUY.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.248
IT WASN'T ABOUT YOU.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.945

09:14.989 --> 09:17.600

09:23.127 --> 09:25.477
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE THAT?

09:25.521 --> 09:28.829
NO. WHAT I NEED TO DO IS

09:28.872 --> 09:31.483

ON THAT DATE THAT WE
WERE SUPPOSED TO GO ON.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.007

OOH, HOW...HOW IS

12:02.199 --> 12:04.201
YO, HOW ARE YOU NOT COLD?

12:04.245 --> 12:06.116
OH, I'M COLD.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.770
I'M JUST NOT A BABY.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.250
OH, OH.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.556
OK. BUT I BET I LAST
IN HERE LONGER THAN YOU.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.733
MM-MM. WHAT DO I WIN?

12:13.776 --> 12:15.430
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.258
I GET TO SHAVE
YOUR LEGS.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.522
HA HA. ALL RIGHT.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.307
BET. BUT IF I WIN,

12:23.351 --> 12:25.309
I GET TO TAKE YOU ON
A REAL DATE.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.791
OH, THAT'S CUTE YOU THINK
YOU GOT A CHANCE TO WIN.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.837
OH. HA HA!

12:33.796 --> 12:36.407
HEY, MA, WHAT YOU
DOING HERE?

12:36.451 --> 12:38.932
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU
NEEDED SOME SPACE, BUT...

12:38.975 --> 12:42.326
I GOT THE DNA
TEST RESULTS BACK.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.896
DAMON IS MY BIOLOGICAL SON.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.553
DID YOU TELL HIM?

12:51.596 --> 12:53.511
HE WON'T ANSWER MY CALLS.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.165
WELL, COULD YOU
BLAME HIM?

12:55.209 --> 12:58.125
MA, YOU ABANDONED HIM.
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

12:58.168 --> 13:00.780
BLENDED FAMILIES EXIST.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.825
Y'ALL COULD'VE MADE IT WORK.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.828
YOUR FATHER REFUSED TO
RAISE ANOTHER MAN'S CHILD.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.830
AND THEN YOU GOT SICK.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.963
AND WITH ALL
THE TREATMENTS AND
THE BILLS ADDING UP--

13:10.006 --> 13:12.139
SO YOU HAD TO DECIDE
BETWEEN KEEPING DAMON

13:12.182 --> 13:14.010
OR TAKING CARE OF ME.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.753
BABY, NO. THAT IS NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.495
ARE YOU SURE, MA?
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M HEARING.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.584
AND THAT'S WHAT DAMON'S
GONNA HEAR.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.413
I GOT TO GO.
COACH TEXTED ME.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.557
HEY, YOUNGBLOOD IN
THE SLICK SUIT.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.559
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.561
SORRY TO DISTURB
YOU, BUT, UH,
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT,

13:43.605 --> 13:46.347
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT TERRY TUCKER.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.914
YEAH. WHAT ABOUT HIM?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.480
WELL, I'M DOING A STORY

13:49.524 --> 13:51.091
ON THE RISE OF P.E.D.
USE IN THE MLB.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.441
WHEN YOU TWO PLAYED
TOGETHER BACK IN '05,

13:53.484 --> 13:55.878
DID HE EXHIBIT ANY
SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR?

13:55.922 --> 13:58.794
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.361
OK.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.493
AND WAS THERE
ANY INDICATION

14:02.537 --> 14:05.975
OF OTHER PLAYERS
ON THE TEAM USING
P.E.D.s AS WELL?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.064
ONE BAD PLAYER, AND YOU WANT
TO CALL THE INTEGRITY

14:08.108 --> 14:09.849
OF AN ENTIRE TEAM
INTO QUESTION, HUH?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.241
COME ON, MARCUS.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.895
TERRY COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THE ONLY PLAYER

14:12.939 --> 14:14.070
IN THAT LOCKER ROOM
PLAYING DIRTY.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.593
LIKE I SAID, MAN,

14:15.637 --> 14:19.075
I DIDN'T NOTICE
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

14:19.119 --> 14:23.340
REALLY? WAS IT MAYBE
JUST EASIER TO IGNORE
WHAT YOU SAW?

14:23.384 --> 14:26.430
ARE YOU DIGGING UP A QUOTE
ABOUT TERRY OR ABOUT ME?

14:26.474 --> 14:28.780
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A THING FOR AMARA,

14:28.824 --> 14:30.347
BUT DO YOU THINK TAKING ME
DOWN IS THE BEST WAY

14:30.391 --> 14:31.914
TO IMPRESS HER, MAN?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.916
LISTEN, MY FEELINGS
FOR AMARA

14:33.960 --> 14:36.049
HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU OR MY WORK.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.616
SURE. LOOK,
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,

14:38.660 --> 14:41.619
BUT MY ANSWER TO ALL OF THEM
IS NO COMMENT.

14:41.663 --> 14:44.100
SO SEE YOURSELF OUT, RALPH.

14:54.197 --> 14:57.113
MARCUS, THIS IS
DR. EPPS CALLING AGAIN.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.986
THE PHARMACY SAID
YOU STILL HAVE NOT
PICKED UP YOUR REFILL

15:00.029 --> 15:01.944
FOR ARIPIPRAZOLE.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.337
MARCUS, IT'S NOT
EFFECTIVE

15:03.380 --> 15:04.468
IF YOU DON'T TAKE
IT DAILY--

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
I WANT TO GRAB
A JUICE BEFORE.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.432
I'LL SEE YOU
OVER THERE, ALL RIGHT?

15:11.475 --> 15:12.607
OH. UH...

15:12.650 --> 15:13.608
OH, I'M SORRY.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.785
MY BAD. HEH.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.395
UH, YOU GOOD?

15:18.439 --> 15:20.920
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.096
I HEARD ABOUT THE GAME.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.967
YEAH. WE--WE WON.

15:25.011 --> 15:28.536
DESPITE YOUR PITCHING.
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

15:28.579 --> 15:32.192
I JUST HAD ONE BAD GAME.
THAT'S IT.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.976
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE LYING?

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
I DON'T KNOW.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.982
HI. SORRY. I DON'T
MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.985
HI, SIMONE. HEY, D., I'M
GONNA GRAB US A TABLE.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.247
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE
YOU IN A SECOND.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.248
OK.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.384
SINCE WHEN DID YOU TWO
BECOME BESTIES?

15:50.427 --> 15:53.648
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND, ALL RIGHT?

16:03.701 --> 16:06.095
CHOCOLATE
WITH, LIKE...

16:07.444 --> 16:09.838
I HAVE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.843
-HEY, AUNTIE!
-DON'T "HEY, AUNTIE" ME.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.976
WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN
YOU SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
BACK FROM L.A.?

16:17.019 --> 16:18.978
WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO EXHAUSTED?

16:19.021 --> 16:21.241
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WHY DID PROFESSOR CORTE

16:21.284 --> 16:24.331
JUST GIVE ME A HEADS-UP
THAT YOU'RE GETTING
A "C" ON YOUR MIDTERM?

16:24.374 --> 16:26.202
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.552
AUNTIE,
I'M ALL As IN HIS CLASS.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.772
WHICH IS WHY HE'S
CONCERNED.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.688
OK. WELL, I GUESS BALANCING
STUDYING, WORK, AND TENNIS

16:33.731 --> 16:35.385
IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT,

16:35.429 --> 16:38.214
BUT EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE
AFTER THE MATCH TOMORROW.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.651
THAT WAS NICE
AND REHEARSED.

16:40.695 --> 16:44.003
OK, I'LL DIG. WHAT
HAPPENED IN L.A.?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.875
BECAUSE I'M GUESSING
THIS ALL HAS
TO DO WITH THAT.

16:49.225 --> 16:52.272
JORDAN AND I BROKE UP.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.622
SIMONE, I AM SO SORRY.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.191
I'M FINE. SERIOUSLY.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.628
JORDAN WAS A MAJOR
PART OF YOUR LIFE.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.152
PRETENDING THAT
LOSING HIM IS JUST
ANOTHER TUESDAY

17:03.196 --> 17:04.806
ISN'T HELPING.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.983
I HEAR YOU, BUT I'M GOOD.
I PROMISE.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.333
I NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING
MY AMERICAN LIT GRADE UP,

17:10.377 --> 17:12.857
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:12.901 --> 17:14.772
YOU THINK PROFESSOR CORTE
WILL GIVE ME ANOTHER SHOT?

17:14.816 --> 17:18.515
I DON'T KNOW, BABY GIRL.
IT'S WORTH ASKING.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.951
MM-HMM.

17:19.995 --> 17:23.738
HEY, JUST KNOW IT'S OK

17:23.781 --> 17:25.696
NOT TO BE OK.

17:25.740 --> 17:30.962
AND IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN THAT PLACE, I'M HERE.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.933
GLAD YOU COULD
FINALLY MAKE IT, SON.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.544
SORRY, COACH.
MY MOM STOPPED BY.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.851
ACTUALLY, CAN I GET YOUR
ADVICE ON SOMETHING?

17:49.894 --> 17:51.983
OH, I GET IT.
NOW THAT YOU'VE MADE
PLAY OF THE DAY,

17:52.027 --> 17:54.290
YOU BIG-TIME NOW, HUH?

17:54.334 --> 17:55.639
HUH? YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S
SCHEDULES, SON?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.598
COACH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
NOT AT ALL.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.513
SURE, EVERYBODY
BEEN HITTING ME UP ABOUT IT,

17:59.556 --> 18:02.472
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HAPPY FOR ME.
IT'S GOOD PRESS, RIGHT?

18:02.516 --> 18:05.736
WRONG. BRINGSTON
DOESN'T NEED ANY MORE
PRESS RIGHT NOW, SON.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.522
SINCE WHEN? WASN'T THE HBCU
BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS

18:08.565 --> 18:10.089
ABOUT MEDIA ATTENTION?

18:10.132 --> 18:11.829
COACH, THIS IS
A GOOD LOOK FOR ME.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.354
LOOK, EVERYTHING ISN'T
ABOUT YOU, J.R. ALL RIGHT?

18:14.397 --> 18:15.920
IF THEY'RE PUTTING
THE FOCUS ON YOU,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.748
IT'LL COME AT THE COST
OF SOMEONE ELSE.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.359
OUR HOMECOMING GAME
AGAINST HAWKINS IS

18:19.402 --> 18:20.925
THE END-ALL, BE-ALL
FOR US.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.753
AND IF WE DON'T FOCUS
ON THAT, WE'RE FINISHED.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.886
NOW, DO YOU WANT TO BE
THE REASON THAT

18:24.929 --> 18:27.584
BRINGSTON BASEBALL
DOESN'T MAKE IT
TO THE SPRING, HMM?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.891
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS
ON THE TEAM.

18:29.934 --> 18:33.199
YOU UNDERSTAND ME? DO
YOU UNDERSTAND ME, SON?!

18:33.242 --> 18:37.028
HMM? I ASKED
YOU A QUESTION.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.945
YES, SIR. I GET IT.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.818
YEAH.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.865
SO I'VE BEEN
OVER THE MINUTES

18:47.909 --> 18:49.432
FROM ALL THE FINANCIAL
MEETINGS.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.696
REMEMBER THE TRUSTEE
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.176
UH, VERONICA SOMETHING.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.960
SKINNER. RIGHT.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.571
WELL, SHE'S ALL OVER
THESE MINUTES.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.442
WHY IS THAT STRANGE?
SHE'S A BOARD MEMBER.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.227
A NEW INTERIM
BOARD MEMBER.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.229
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE
A SECOND TO GET

19:03.272 --> 19:04.665
THE LAY OF THE LAND.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.014
SHE JUST JUMPED IN,
DAY ONE,

19:06.057 --> 19:07.624
PUSHING TO INCREASE
FUNDING

19:07.668 --> 19:10.061
IN THE ENGINEERING
AND LIBERAL ARTS
DEPARTMENTS.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.107
AND THEY SEEM TO BE
LISTENING TO HER.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.718
HEY. WAIT. IF BRINGSTON IS
HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,

19:14.762 --> 19:16.938
WHY ARE THEY GIVING ANY
EXTRA MONEY TO ANY PROGRAMS?

19:16.981 --> 19:20.202
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M
STARTING TO THINK
MY FINANCIAL STORY

19:20.246 --> 19:21.725
AND WHATEVER
VERONICA IS DOING
AT BRINGSTON

19:21.769 --> 19:23.249
ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.947
DO YOU HAVE ANY SOURCES
CLOSE TO HER?

19:25.990 --> 19:28.602
ONE--HER SISTER.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.039
GREAT. SO WORK
YOUR AMARA MAGIC

19:31.082 --> 19:32.736
AND THEN BREAK THE STORY.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.043
HUH. GOING TO BE
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

19:35.086 --> 19:39.134
THAN THAT, RALPH,
BUT I'M FIGURING IT OUT.

19:43.486 --> 19:47.838
SO I ENDED UP SPEAKING
WITH MARCUS.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.189
OK. HOW DID IT GO?

19:50.232 --> 19:53.017
SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH HIM.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.585
HE GOT PRETTY
AGGRESSIVE WITH ME.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.979
AGGRESSIVE? MARCUS TURNER?

19:58.022 --> 20:00.982
I'M SURE YOU'RE
MISREADING THE SITUATION.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.984
YEAH. TRUST ME. I'M NOT.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.858
LOOK, RALPH...

20:07.902 --> 20:11.645
JUST BECAUSE I STOPPED
PURSUING SOMETHING
ROMANTIC WITH YOU

20:11.688 --> 20:12.863
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET TO TAKE--

20:12.907 --> 20:14.822
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TWO?

20:14.865 --> 20:17.868
LOOK. I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN
THAT CAN HANDLE
REJECTION JUST FINE,

20:17.912 --> 20:20.784
BUT I'VE GOT TWO EYES.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.918
AND WHAT I SAW,
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.789
IF I WAS YOU, I WOULD...

20:25.833 --> 20:27.530
I WOULD GIVE HIM SOME SPACE.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.489
I SHOULD GO.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.585
IS IT ME

20:38.628 --> 20:41.805
OR DOES IT FEEL LIKE
WE'RE IN A CHEESY
ROMANTIC NOVEL?

20:41.849 --> 20:44.068
UHH, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO RETRACT YOUR SHADE.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.114
I LOVE ROMANCE NOVELS.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.898
THEA, NO, YOU DON'T.

20:47.942 --> 20:50.292
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY'RE CORNY
AND UNREALISTIC,

20:50.336 --> 20:52.468
AT LEAST SO I'VE HEARD.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.557
I DO LOVE THIS, THOUGH.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.690
IT'S BEEN THE BEST NIGHT.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.129
YEAH.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.523
UH, IT REALLY HAS.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.742
YO, DAMON...

21:05.786 --> 21:07.353
OH, DAMN. I DIDN'T MEAN--

21:07.396 --> 21:10.704
YEAH, WELL, YOU DID,
ALL RIGHT?

21:10.747 --> 21:13.489
WHAT'S
GOING ON, MAN?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.404
DNA RESULTS CAME IN.

21:17.101 --> 21:21.192
LOOK, IT'S COOL.
I ALREADY FILLED HER IN.

21:21.236 --> 21:24.065
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.720
WE'RE HALF-BROTHERS, MAN.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.765
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS MAY BE HARD,

21:28.809 --> 21:31.115
BUT IGNORING
OUR MOTHER ISN'T GONNA
MAKE IT ANY EASIER.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.900
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE DNA TEST SAYS,
ALL RIGHT?

21:32.943 --> 21:34.989
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
BE MY MOTHER.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.034
ALL RIGHT? SHE GAVE
ME UP WITHOUT EVEN
A SECOND THOUGHT.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.646
OK, D., I HEAR THAT. I DO.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.430
BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

21:41.474 --> 21:44.955
OH, SO GHOSTING ME
HAS BEEN INTENTIONAL.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.088
SAY IT, DAMON. SAY IT.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.916
LOOK, YOU WERE SICK,
ALL RIGHT,

21:48.959 --> 21:50.874
AND SHE TOOK CARE OF
YOU AND GOT RID OF ME.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.441
YOU'RE LITERALLY
THE CHOSEN SON.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.356
OK, DAMON, IF I
COULD CHANGE IT, I WOULD.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.140
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.968
AND SO NOW EVERY TIME
THAT I LOOK AT YOU,

21:58.012 --> 21:59.622
I AM REMINDED THAT IT
WAS MORE IMPORTANT

21:59.666 --> 22:02.930
TO TAKE CARE OF J.R.
THAN IT WAS TO KEEP ME.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.021
UNDERSTOOD.

22:13.419 --> 22:17.074
UM, HEH, UM, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS,

22:17.118 --> 22:18.989
ALL THIS FAMILY DRAMA.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.253
THAT IS NOT HOW I
WANTED OUR DATE TO END.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.517
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

22:24.560 --> 22:29.348
YEAH. AND J.R.
DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.480
WAIT. HIS MOM
LITERALLY GAVE ME AWAY.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.395
YEAH. SHE DID, NOT HIM.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.832
NEITHER OF YOU ASKED FOR THIS.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.139
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE HURT

22:38.182 --> 22:39.923
AND YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU,

22:39.967 --> 22:42.012
SO TALK TO YOUR
BIRTH MOM OR DON'T.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.884
BUT BURNING YOUR
NEWFOUND BROTHER,

22:43.927 --> 22:45.668
WHO'S BEEN YOUR BEST FRIEND
SINCE YOU GOT HERE,

22:45.712 --> 22:48.323
WON'T DO YOU, NOR HIM,
ANY GOOD.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.429
-HEY.
-OH!

23:07.473 --> 23:09.562
JESSIE RAYMOND, THAT HAIR!

23:09.605 --> 23:11.738
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN MY CHAIR EVERY TWO WEEKS.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.870
YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY NOT
HERE FOR A HAIRCUT.
I'M HERE TO TALK.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.046
OH, UH, SORRY.
I WISH I COULD,

23:16.090 --> 23:18.048
BUT I GOT A BIG TOURNAMENT.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.876
WELL, I WAS HERE TO
TALK TO NATE,

23:19.920 --> 23:21.487
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT LOOK LIKE YOU
NEED A VENT SESSION.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.314
YOU GOOD?

23:23.358 --> 23:26.579
SIMONE, YOUR FACE IS CALLING.
IT NEEDS YOU TO PICK IT UP.

23:26.622 --> 23:30.452
WHATEVER.
IS THIS ABOUT DAMON?

23:30.496 --> 23:32.149
I GOT THIS.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.978
YOU GO HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS
ON THE COURTS, MISSY.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.719
BRING HOME SOMETHING
SHINY FOR THE ROOM

23:36.763 --> 23:39.505
SINCE YOU HAVE YET TO ADD
ANYTHING TO THE DECOR.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.031
SINCE YOU'RE HERE, I MIGHT
AS WELL GET YOU RIGHT.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.337
MM-HMM.

23:49.950 --> 23:53.040
YOU KNOW,
I FOUND OUT DAMON IS
MY BIOLOGICAL BROTHER.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.609
OOH. THAT WAS NOT
ON MY BINGO CARD.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.959
YOU TWO MUST BE THRILLED.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.396
ACTUALLY, NOW HE WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.094
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE
MY ILLNESS

24:04.138 --> 24:05.835
ALWAYS TAKES THINGS
FROM ME.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.359
FIRST MY BROTHER,
BASEBALL.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.580
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THE BROTHER PART,

24:11.624 --> 24:14.409
BUT LOOK AT THE VIEWS
YOUR VIDEO'S GOTTEN.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.716
PEEP THE COMMENTS.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.501
IF THEY AREN'T TALKING
ABOUT WHICH MLB TEAM
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON,

24:19.545 --> 24:21.329
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHO'S GONNA DATE YOU.

24:21.372 --> 24:22.852
HA HA. SO I WOULD SAY
NO ONE AND NOTHING

24:22.896 --> 24:25.028
IS EVER TAKING
BASEBALL FROM YOU.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.117
I DON'T KNOW. MY COACH
IS SAYING I'M TAKING
TOO MUCH ATTENTION

24:27.161 --> 24:28.641
AWAY FROM THE TEAM.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.599
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
IS THAT WHO I AM?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.645
DO PEOPLE GET
KICKED TO THE CURB
BECAUSE OF ME?

24:32.688 --> 24:34.690
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.387
YOU CANNOT BLAME
YOURSELF FOR THE CHOICES
YOUR MOTHER MADE.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.693
YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO BE SICK.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.652
DAMON WILL SEE THAT.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.915
AS FAR AS YOUR COACH,
DON'T LET HIM STEAL
THIS MOMENT

24:41.958 --> 24:44.004
BECAUSE YOU EARNED IT
ON AND OFF THE FIELD.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.093
YEAH.

24:46.136 --> 24:49.139
MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GONNA WORK WITH YOU
AS YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER

24:49.183 --> 24:51.794
TO MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T MISS THIS MOMENT.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.975
IS ALL THIS FOR REAL?

25:00.760 --> 25:03.240
I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME,

25:03.284 --> 25:06.417
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.812
AND I'M HERE IF
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY

25:09.856 --> 25:11.553
TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.076
YOU LOVE ME?

25:13.120 --> 25:14.730
YES.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.558
BUT HOW? YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.996
FOR 18 YEARS, YOU KNEW
THAT I WAS OUT THERE

25:20.040 --> 25:21.781
AND YOU NEVER BOTHERED
TO CONTACT ME.

25:21.824 --> 25:25.088
NO PHONE CALLS ON CHRISTMAS,
NO BIRTHDAY CARDS OR NOTHING.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.353
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT XAVIER WANTED.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.921
MY DAD WANTED TO KEEP
YOU AWAY FROM ME?

25:33.619 --> 25:38.145
HE HAD JUST MARRIED
YOUR MOM

25:38.188 --> 25:40.408
WHEN I CALLED TO
TELL HIM ABOUT YOU.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.323
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE HER.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.067
I AGREED TO STAY AWAY.

25:47.110 --> 25:50.418
SO NOT ONLY DID MY DAD
LIE TO ME MY ENTIRE LIFE...

25:51.854 --> 25:53.943
BUT HE KEPT MY
BIRTH MOTHER AWAY FROM ME

25:53.987 --> 25:57.207
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO
OWN UP TO HIS MISTAKES.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.600
DAMON.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.170
NO. NO, NO. I GOT TO GO.

26:03.213 --> 26:04.954
I'M SORRY.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.660
WOW. YOU CAN SEE
THE DUNNETT FROM HERE.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.792
YEAH. I WAS FORTUNATE
TO FIND THIS PLACE.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.926
FORTUNATE? GIRL, I AM
SURE YOU EARNED IT.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.710
THAT WAS ALWAYS
YOUR M.O.

26:21.754 --> 26:25.453
I THINK YOUR SISTER VERONICA
WOULD BEG TO DIFFER.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.804
LOOK, JADA, I'M SORRY

26:28.848 --> 26:30.719
FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN COLLEGE.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.416
YOU GOT CAUGHT UP
IN MY ACTIVISM WAKE,

26:32.460 --> 26:33.766
AND I GOT YOU SUSPENDED.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.203
STOP. I GOT
MYSELF SUSPENDED.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.031
YOU DIDN'T MAKE ME
DO ANYTHING THAT

26:38.074 --> 26:40.163
I WASN'T GONNA
ALREADY DO ANYWAY.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.992
SOMETIMES TROUBLE'S
THE PRICE YOU PAY

26:43.036 --> 26:44.777
FOR DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.779
BUT THEN IF YOU
TRULY DON'T BLAME ME,

26:46.822 --> 26:49.303
WHY IS VERONICA HERE AT
BRINGSTON WITH A VENDETTA?

26:49.346 --> 26:51.653
SHE TRIED TO HAVE ME FIRED.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.916
I AM SO SORRY THAT SHE
HAS BEEN COMING AFTER YOU.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.093
AND NOW SHE'S MEDDLING IN
BRINGSTON'S FINANCES.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.661
IS THAT SOMEHOW
ABOUT ME, TOO?

26:59.705 --> 27:02.229
VERONICA DOESN'T MIX
PERSONAL WITH BUSINESS
LIKE THAT.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.274
AND BRINGSTON ISN'T
THE ONLY BOARD THAT
SHE'S A PART OF.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.059
WHAT OTHER BOARD IS SHE ON?

27:06.102 --> 27:07.713
WILLIS COBB. IT'S A...

27:07.756 --> 27:09.802
PWI IN MARIETTA.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.543
YES. THEY'RE HAVING
MONEY TROUBLES JUST
LIKE BRINGSTON.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.937
SHE'S HELPING THEM
GET THEIR FINANCES
IN ORDER, TOO.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.897
THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES
FOR A LIVING, AMARA.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.768
SHE'S GOOD AT IT.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.727
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

27:21.770 --> 27:23.729
VERONICA IS HERE
TO HELP BRINGSTON?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.731
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

27:25.774 --> 27:29.648
WHEREVER VERONICA GOES,
WHOEVER SHE "HELPS"

27:29.691 --> 27:31.737
ENDS UP SOLD.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.832
GIRL, YOU WON.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.181
YOU QUALIFIED FOR YOUR
FIRST PRO TOURNAMENT.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.573
HOW ARE YOU NOT
SCREAMING RIGHT NOW?

27:42.617 --> 27:44.488
I AM EXCITED.
I'M JUST TIRED.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.055
NAH, YOU
GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER, GIRL.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.317
WE ARE GOING OUT
TO CELEBRATE RIGHT NOW.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.189
BECCA--

27:49.232 --> 27:50.581
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY WANT
TO CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND

27:50.625 --> 27:52.714
AND CELEBRATE
WITH HIM FIRST,

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
BUT YOU GOT 20 MINUTES
WITH HIM AND THEN
WE ARE GOING OUT.
