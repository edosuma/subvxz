(male narrator)
Tonight on a very special
Clone High,

00:12.033 --> 00:13.933
one of the clones
you've grown to love

00:13.933 --> 00:15.867
will be horribly killed.

00:15.867 --> 00:17.500
This is not
some cheap-ass stunt

00:17.500 --> 00:19.467
where we lamely introduce
a new character

00:19.467 --> 00:20.733
just to kill him off.

00:20.733 --> 00:23.467
A clone dies tonight.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.367
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:26.367 --> 00:29.300
* Secret government employees

00:29.300 --> 00:32.200
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:32.200 --> 00:35.233
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:35.233 --> 00:38.033
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:38.033 --> 00:40.867
* They're gonna make it
if they try *

00:40.867 --> 00:43.767
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:43.767 --> 00:50.100
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:50.100 --> 00:52.833
* Clone High

00:52.833 --> 00:58.433
* Clone High

01:02.700 --> 01:05.067
Another french fry,
Abe?

01:07.300 --> 01:10.233
[both slurping]

01:14.700 --> 01:17.233
JFK with Ponce de León,

01:17.233 --> 01:18.633
what a surprise.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.700
Are you guys ever apart?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.167
splat!

01:22.167 --> 01:23.500
Oh, Ponce,

01:23.500 --> 01:26.433
you are
a regular character.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.333
Like my tattoo says,

01:28.333 --> 01:30.733
we're like
two peas in a pod.

01:30.733 --> 01:32.567
Best friends for life.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.467
Till death do us part.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.867
How about a picture
of the best friends?

01:36.867 --> 01:38.967
Say, "Best friends!"

01:38.967 --> 01:41.367
(both)
Best friends.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.967
(JFK)
Hey, uh, Poncey,

01:43.967 --> 01:46.767
watch me flip over
this garbage can!

01:46.767 --> 01:47.767
Hi-oh!

01:47.767 --> 01:49.067
Ha, good one, bro.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.600
Check this out.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.333
Swish.
Ha-ha.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.700
Littering's so cool.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.100
Hello, Cleo.
How are you?

01:57.100 --> 01:59.267
I'm fine.
And you, JFK?

01:59.267 --> 02:00.800
- Fine.
- Me too.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.067
- Good.
- Good.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.067
Great.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.900
Great.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.367
Thanks for not making this
too weird.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.933
You know what's weird?

02:08.933 --> 02:10.233
That tall,
lanky knucklehead

02:10.233 --> 02:12.633
licking the inside
of your mouth!

02:12.633 --> 02:15.867
I bet Lincoln here
throws his trash away

02:15.867 --> 02:18.167
in the proper receptacle.

02:18.167 --> 02:19.867
No, I've littered...

02:19.867 --> 02:22.767
lots of times.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.900
[groaning]

02:24.900 --> 02:27.967
Good one, Abe.
That was classic.

02:27.967 --> 02:29.967
[laughs]

02:29.967 --> 02:31.400
Teens and their litter.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.967
[scatting]

02:35.067 --> 02:36.100
[gasps]

02:36.100 --> 02:37.200
'Sup, litterbug?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.633
Or should I say lovebug?

02:39.633 --> 02:41.400
You two seem to be getting
pretty serious.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.967
Thanks for noticing,
Ponce.

02:42.967 --> 02:45.067
You know, when I get serious
with a lady,

02:45.067 --> 02:47.300
I like to take her
someplace special.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.533
Maybe he's right.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.733
Let's go to Teen Sex Cove.

02:51.733 --> 02:52.767
[gasps]

02:52.767 --> 02:54.633
[screams]

02:54.633 --> 02:57.500
Um, yeah, let's do it.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.533
[heart screams]

03:00.533 --> 03:02.133
Then it's a date.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.133
[slurps]

03:04.133 --> 03:05.533
You're a lucky dude,
A-Linc.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.100
And don't sweat JFK.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.500
He's almost over Cleo.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
He's lucky to have a friend
like you, Ponce.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.867
We all are.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.567
JFK is a good dude.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.100
I am proud to know him.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.067
You should probably
tell him that.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.300
Yeah, think I will.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.467
Guess who went
to the mall, baby.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.733
Gandhi.

03:23.733 --> 03:25.200
And you better warm up
to these warm-ups,

03:25.200 --> 03:27.933
'cause I'm gonna be wearing them
all the time.

03:27.933 --> 03:30.867
Extra small, saggy style.
Ow!

03:30.867 --> 03:32.333
[laughs]

03:32.333 --> 03:35.767
Gandhi, you are
a total original.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.833
I'm not surprised,
but thanks, Ponce.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.433
Well, I got to bolt.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.067
If I don't see you guys again,
good-bye,

03:41.067 --> 03:42.400
and have a wonderful life.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.900
[laughs]

03:43.900 --> 03:46.067
Why do you always say that,
Ponce?

03:46.067 --> 03:47.933
It's just my thing, man.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.600
I love life.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.367
[sighs]
Who's there?

03:55.367 --> 03:56.767
Orange.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.200
Orange who?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.900
Orange you jealous
of my new warm-ups?

03:59.900 --> 04:01.100
That's who.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.067
[cackles]

04:04.067 --> 04:05.600
Ponce said he loved 'em.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.667
[tires screech]

04:06.667 --> 04:07.867
- Ooh!
- [groans]

04:07.867 --> 04:10.067
Littering's not cool, Gandhi.

04:10.067 --> 04:13.333
If littering's not cool,
then why does Ponce do it?

04:13.333 --> 04:14.333
Jeez, you're lame.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.500
Out!

04:15.500 --> 04:17.567
And I'm keeping
your car seat.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.867
Oh, man!

04:19.867 --> 04:22.067
(man)
Trash kebab?

04:22.067 --> 04:26.067
Thanks.
Hey, sweet warm-ups.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.967
Okay, round up.
Everyone on the bus.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.900
We're on the honor system here.
Let's go.

04:31.267 --> 04:33.733
Guards, grab
the petite one.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.467
[gasps]

04:35.467 --> 04:38.867
[screaming]

04:38.867 --> 04:41.700
[whistling]

04:41.700 --> 04:45.067
Take your time, Glenn.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.433
[whistling]

04:46.433 --> 04:48.933
That doesn't need dusting,
thank you.

04:48.933 --> 04:51.067
You guys, do me a favor.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.800
Have yourselves a great day.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.300
[scatting]

04:55.300 --> 04:57.100
[door clicks shut]

04:57.100 --> 05:00.100
Ooh, what a jackass!

05:00.100 --> 05:03.500
He thinks he's the hottest thing
since wheels on a bucket.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.067
I like him.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.300
You would.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.667
Have you seen my secret files?

05:10.667 --> 05:12.733
I'm sure it's where you left it.

05:12.733 --> 05:16.567
It was that cocky janitor,
Glenn!

05:16.567 --> 05:18.733
I have a system,
and he comes in

05:18.733 --> 05:21.400
and puts everything
into neat little piles.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.967
Neat little piles of chaos,
Mr. B!

05:23.967 --> 05:25.500
Chaos!

05:25.500 --> 05:26.733
(Mr. Butlertron)
Found it.

05:26.733 --> 05:30.700
It was in the bathroom
next to your YM...

05:30.700 --> 05:34.200
and your BM,

05:34.200 --> 05:35.833
Wesley.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.567
Damn that janitor!

05:40.567 --> 05:43.333
(Ponce)
I've been thinking a lot
lately, JFK,

05:43.333 --> 05:44.500
about life and stuff.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.333
If by life,
you mean sex

05:47.333 --> 05:49.933
and by thinking,
you mean having.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.233
Hey, Poncey?

05:51.233 --> 05:52.767
Life is so short.

05:52.767 --> 05:56.433
I mean, there's no
fountain of youth, Jackie boy.

05:56.433 --> 05:59.067
You got to live every day
like it was your last.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.067
I want to make sure
everyone knows

06:01.067 --> 06:02.300
how I feel about them.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.200
Feelings are for dames!

06:04.200 --> 06:06.767
You are so detached, man.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.333
I'm trying to get
in touch with me,

06:09.333 --> 06:10.433
in here.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.400
I don't know who you are.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.600
But you're not my friend Ponce.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.667
You're some kind of sissy broad.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.967
Calm down, Jack.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.867
I am perfectly calm!

06:20.867 --> 06:22.767
I am trying to tell you
something

06:22.767 --> 06:24.700
before it's too late.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.867
It is too late,
whoever you are.

06:27.867 --> 06:32.500
Because the real Ponce
is dead to me!

06:32.500 --> 06:33.900
[yells]

06:33.900 --> 06:35.600
I hate you, JFK.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.967
[gasps]

06:38.700 --> 06:40.233
[gasps]

06:42.733 --> 06:44.333
Wait! Jackie boy!

06:44.333 --> 06:45.967
I didn't mean it.

06:45.967 --> 06:49.567
Ponce, everyone's littering
because they look up to you.

06:49.567 --> 06:50.833
You've got to stop.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.833
What, Joan?
Is litter gonna kill me?

06:52.833 --> 06:55.200
[echoing]
Kill me? Kill me?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.667
What the--

06:57.667 --> 07:00.133
Ow! Candy wrapper cut!

07:00.133 --> 07:01.133

07:08.500 --> 07:09.767
Oh!

Aah. Oh, I--

08:01.733 --> 08:09.167
* The tears stream down
like a flood *

08:09.167 --> 08:14.833
* Since you drowned
in your own blood *

08:14.833 --> 08:16.567
Hi, I'm Glenn.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.600
I'm the school janitor.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.200
Ponce was like a son to me,

08:21.200 --> 08:24.900
probably because
he was my foster son...

08:24.900 --> 08:26.467
my dead foster son.

08:26.467 --> 08:27.900
[cries]

08:27.900 --> 08:29.300
Son, I just want you
to know that--

08:29.300 --> 08:31.067
Oh, janitor!

08:31.067 --> 08:33.833
Some kid vomited
in the hallway.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.567
Could you make with the sawdust
and clean it up?

08:36.567 --> 08:40.567
Uh, yeah, but I'm kind of giving
my son's eulogy right now.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.800
Ooh, yeah.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.067
If you could just do it now.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.400
Your son will still be dead
when you come back.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.333
[wheels squeaking]

08:53.633 --> 08:56.333
[sniffles]

08:56.333 --> 09:00.467
Ponce de León
was my best friend.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.067
He left me these pants.

09:03.067 --> 09:06.067
They're Ponce's pants.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
Ponce's pants.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.767
Stand up!

09:09.767 --> 09:11.467
I know you're not
really dead.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.700
Stand up,
or I'll sock you one!

09:14.700 --> 09:15.900
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

09:15.900 --> 09:18.367
I just killed my dead friend!

09:22.367 --> 09:25.900
Ponce, I'm gonna sleep here
next to you.

Genghis Khan,
sing us back to class.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.967
Okay. I sing now.

* Ave Maria

10:00.367 --> 10:02.933
You guys, pick up your trash.

10:02.933 --> 10:05.767
You guys, Ponce died from trash,
you guys.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.600
And now you guys
are littering.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.767
That sucks, you guys.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.000
Ow.

You guys suck.

(Joan)
Yeah, very funny, Gandhi. Bye.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.400
(Gandhi)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joan.
I'm in lockdown.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.200
On death row.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.733
You got to get me out.

10:25.733 --> 10:27.800
Gandhi, what did you do, "A"?

10:27.800 --> 10:30.233
And "B," why did you open
with a crank call?

10:30.233 --> 10:31.467
Oh, that's 'cause I always--

orange warm-ups.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.100
So's everyone
in this place.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.833
Start walking.

10:40.833 --> 10:45.133
[prisoners whistling

10:45.133 --> 10:46.233
Nice orange warm-ups.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.167
Do you wear 'em
in the shower?

10:48.167 --> 10:50.367
I'll see you in the shower, boy!

that I said? *

10:58.867 --> 11:03.267
(JFK)
Why, Ponce?

11:03.267 --> 11:04.500
(man)
* Too many voices in my head

11:04.500 --> 11:05.600
(JFK)
You took him!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.700
This is your fault, God!

11:07.700 --> 11:09.767
I killed my best friend!

11:09.767 --> 11:11.400
Let it out.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.300
Let it out.

11:13.300 --> 11:18.067
[JFK crying]

11:18.067 --> 11:24.633

* And I can't bring back
yesterday *

11:24.633 --> 11:26.667
[JFK sniffles]

11:26.667 --> 11:29.067
Cheer up, friend.
It's not your fault.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.167
(JFK)
Oh, my God.

11:30.167 --> 11:33.400
You're a g-g-g-g--
dead guy!

11:33.400 --> 11:35.533
No, I'm not a ghost.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.333
I'm part
of your subconscious.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.300
I knew you weren't dead,
Ponce-o!

11:40.300 --> 11:42.067
Let's go score some chicks!

11:42.067 --> 11:43.933
No, you don't understand.

11:43.933 --> 11:46.867
I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

11:46.867 --> 11:49.267
Oh!

11:49.267 --> 11:50.300
You're a genie!

11:50.300 --> 11:53.400
I'm not a genie.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.367
For my first wish,

11:55.367 --> 11:57.600
I want my dead friend back.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.800
Ponce!

12:00.800 --> 12:02.500
You're back!

12:02.500 --> 12:03.967
I missed you, buddy!

12:03.967 --> 12:06.467
This is so frustrating.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.967
Joan, you got to bust me out

12:08.967 --> 12:10.333
before shower time.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.133
I'm talking to some lawyers,
Gandhi.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.867
We're doing everything we can.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.467
Joan, I haven't gotten
a single high five

12:15.467 --> 12:17.067
since I've been in here.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.367
Could you give me a few
under the table?

12:19.367 --> 12:20.667
Everyone else
is getting 'em.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.700
[hands slapping]

12:27.267 --> 12:30.700
Gandhi, I have some bad news.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.400
It's about Ponce.

[both slurping]

12:41.067 --> 12:43.600
Cleo, this isn't working
for me.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.733
I'm not comfortable with you
spending so much time

12:45.733 --> 12:47.600
with your ex, JFK.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.867
Don't worry about me.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.567
I've got my Game Boy.

12:51.567 --> 12:54.233
The only game
that boy is playing

12:54.233 --> 12:56.400
is pretending to be sad,

12:56.400 --> 12:58.967
and first prize
is getting into your pants!

12:58.967 --> 13:01.067
It's not about that, baby.

13:01.067 --> 13:04.500
All that matters
is you and me.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.800
[video game beeps]

13:05.800 --> 13:08.333
Now Mario's dead!

13:08.333 --> 13:10.067
I'm killing everyone!

13:10.067 --> 13:13.700
Oh, why couldn't Ponce have had
three lives like Mario?

13:13.700 --> 13:16.167
Maybe I should
go back there.

13:16.167 --> 13:19.067
[car horn beeps]

13:19.067 --> 13:21.067
It's gonna be okay, baby.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.167
I'll just
leave you two alone,

13:23.167 --> 13:26.367
because it looks like
you're about to do it anyway!

13:26.367 --> 13:28.433
(JFK)
Why--dead--

13:28.433 --> 13:30.933
If I just--
I just want to--

13:30.933 --> 13:32.800
I can--
Why?

13:32.800 --> 13:33.900
[cries]

13:33.900 --> 13:35.200
Here's the keys.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.067
Drop my car off at my house
when you're done.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.967
[lively music]

13:44.400 --> 13:49.100

* Why are you so dead?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.600
* Ah-ah

13:51.600 --> 13:56.800
* Miss your bloody
bug-eyed head *

13:56.800 --> 14:04.633
* Oh, we can't replace
your dead, bloated face *

14:04.633 --> 14:11.400
* You've touched us all
with the life you led *

14:12.667 --> 14:15.100
[ladder creaks]

14:15.100 --> 14:18.400
I've been acting
such the fool, Joan.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.133
I berated Cleo for comforting
JFK in his time of grief.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.533
When we cast our love

14:24.533 --> 14:26.467
into the sea
of human emotion,

14:26.467 --> 14:28.300
sometimes what we catch

14:28.300 --> 14:30.100
is in fate's hands.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.800
I never asked to be a fisherman
in such a sea as this.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.067
Then you know what you must do.

14:36.067 --> 14:39.067
[crying]

14:57.333 --> 15:00.367

It's time for your initiation.

Welcome aboard.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.467

Yeah!

15:17.467 --> 15:19.833
Your death row name
is Silky Butterfly.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.267
That's it?

15:21.267 --> 15:22.667
That's the initiation?

15:22.667 --> 15:23.767
Damn, boy!

15:23.767 --> 15:25.433
What'd you think
we was gonna do?

15:25.433 --> 15:27.567
Make love to you?

15:27.567 --> 15:30.500
[laughter]

15:33.333 --> 15:34.867
Oh, shoot.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.167
I really needed this,
'cause I just got some bad news.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.933
You need to talk about it
with somebody?

15:40.933 --> 15:43.500
We're all
real good listeners.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.467
My friend died.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.900
He was killed by litter.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.533
He was white and privileged.

15:52.533 --> 15:53.833
[all gasp]

15:53.833 --> 15:57.067
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.600
Was he famous?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.467
That's still really sad.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.700
I got to go to his grave
or light a candle or something.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.267
I-I'm breaking out of here.

16:05.267 --> 16:08.667
Whoa, Gandhi!
That's against the rules.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.400
I don't care, Sunshine.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.233
My friend is dead.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.333
Then we're gonna help,

16:14.333 --> 16:15.933
prison style.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.467
I'm sorry about
how I've been acting.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.300
I don't really know
what to say.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.433
[sniffles]

16:32.433 --> 16:34.067
So I'm just gonna hug you

16:34.067 --> 16:37.533
and hold you
for a really long time.

16:37.533 --> 16:40.733
(man)
* Why the night
seems darker... *

16:40.733 --> 16:41.767
Let go!

Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:44.633 --> 16:46.933
It's all right.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.433
Abe's here.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.067
Let go, or I'll slug you!

16:51.067 --> 16:53.933
(man)
* To a time we spent together

16:53.933 --> 16:55.533
* When there was you and me

Hold me!

(man)
* There's a hole you left
inside me *

17:00.800 --> 17:04.067
* A brokenhearted souvenir

17:04.067 --> 17:05.800
I'm a Kennedy.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.067
I'm not accustomed
to tragedy.

17:08.067 --> 17:11.300
(man)
* To remind me you were here

17:11.300 --> 17:14.533
You know the last thing
Ponce said to me?

17:14.533 --> 17:17.867
He said, "I hate you."

17:17.867 --> 17:19.333
Oh, yeah?

17:19.333 --> 17:23.067
Well, you want to know
the last thing Ponce told me?

17:23.067 --> 17:25.667
He told me that you
were a good dude.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.333
Really?

17:27.333 --> 17:29.500
Poncey said that?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.933
(man)
* A brokenhearted souvenir

17:31.933 --> 17:35.067
Let's not let Ponce die
in vain.

17:35.067 --> 17:38.600
We should learn from this
and put an end to litter...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.900
forever.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.067
Ponce would have
wanted it that way.

17:43.067 --> 17:45.467
But Ponce loved littering.

17:45.467 --> 17:48.300
Yeah, but once
litter killed him,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.800
he probably would have
changed his mind.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.367
He said something
about that.

17:53.367 --> 17:56.333
I saw him recently.
He's a genie now.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.133
[whispering]
He lives in my head.

18:00.833 --> 18:03.767
[snoring]

18:14.600 --> 18:15.667
(man)
Guys, this way.

Come on.

[indistinct mumbling]

18:19.500 --> 18:21.100

Guys.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.633
I'm serious, you guys.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.167
We made it! We're free!

18:24.167 --> 18:25.367
[all cheering]

18:25.367 --> 18:27.367
I'm gonna kill that bitch!

18:27.367 --> 18:31.100
There's just so much litter.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.233
I hope you don't mind.

18:33.233 --> 18:35.633
I brought some friends along.

18:35.633 --> 18:39.200
And I brought some
convicted felons to help out.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.267
Yeah, we know a thing or two
about picking up trash.

18:43.267 --> 18:46.600
[laughter]

18:47.900 --> 18:50.900
Now, who wants to pick up
some litter?

18:50.900 --> 18:52.800
I don't usually do this,

18:52.800 --> 18:56.367
but there's a few more friends
that could help us out.

18:56.367 --> 18:57.633
From land,

18:57.633 --> 18:58.967
from sea,

18:58.967 --> 19:00.600

* And the sun doesn't shine
as brightly *

Well, I guess we won't
be needing

19:36.433 --> 19:39.400
that janitor anymore, hey?

19:39.400 --> 19:40.933
Sorry, brother.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.500
We're going to have
to let you go.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.167
But I lost my son.

19:46.167 --> 19:47.967
This job is all I've got.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.400
Yeah, great.

* To remind me you were here

19:54.100 --> 19:56.767
I guess some people
rely on litter for their jobs.

Maybe littering
is good...

19:59.700 --> 20:01.833
in moderation.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.800

In moderation!

No. Oh.
