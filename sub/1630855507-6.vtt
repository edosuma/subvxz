* MTV...

00:07.575 --> 00:10.144
[music]

00:13.647 --> 00:15.483
[seagulls screeching]

00:23.023 --> 00:24.325
[phone rings]

00:27.628 --> 00:29.029
Hey.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.498
- Are you close?
- I'm getting close.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.600
Weather's not cooperating
with our weekend.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.335
- You are wrong.
The weather is perfect.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.969
I love the rain.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.605
Hurry, I have
a surprise for you.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.340
- I'm hurrying.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.342
- Hurry harder. Your surprise
has to leave at seven.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.146
[phone rings]

00:47.415 --> 00:49.517
- What's my surprise?

00:49.550 --> 00:53.087
- Five women just arrived, two
of them have massage tables.

00:53.121 --> 00:56.090
So it looks like you're
going to have a spa day.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.658
- Wonderful.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.260
- Look at the bright side.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.330
- Yeah?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.031
- I don't know, I haven't
thought of one yet.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.533
Well, here's the bright side.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.668
I mean, you're not talking
when you have a facial.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.503
[Joe] Three days alone
with this girl,

01:09.537 --> 01:12.206
every lie you tell her,
she is going to remember.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.908
Tell the truth, just change
the names and locations.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.945
Answer questions with questions
then do a lot of listening.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.012
[Cruz]
Roger that.

01:19.045 --> 01:22.283
- No, not "roger that".

01:22.316 --> 01:24.452
[deep breath]

01:24.485 --> 01:26.554
This is her wanting
to know you.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.158
I need you to
understand the risks.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.459
- I understand the risk.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.261
- Guess we're gonna find out.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.062
- Hey, Cruz.
We write all this stuff down.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.332
So you'll have a cheat sheet
for the next time, okay?

01:38.366 --> 01:41.068
- Let's worry about next time
when we have one.

01:41.101 --> 01:41.702
[phone rings]

01:41.735 --> 01:43.437
Hey.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.307
[Kaitlyn] The debrief's
at the White House now.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.609
- The White House. Why?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.244
Who's in the debrief?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.413
- I don't know yet.
I'm gonna pick you up.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.014
We'll talk about it in the car.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.421
My meeting's been moved
to the White House now.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.489
- I heard.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.725
- Heard from who?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.994
- If it would make a difference,
I'd tell you.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.197
- Do you know who's
in this meeting?

02:09.229 --> 02:11.064
- Don't you?

02:11.098 --> 02:13.167
- I knew who was in
the debrief was at Langley.

02:15.603 --> 02:19.072
Well, it won't
be the President.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.574
- Wouldn't be the
President anyway.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.975
You don't plan bus routes
with the bus driver.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.377
You just tell him
where to drive.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.483
- I see the Secretary of State
has canceled his trip to Poland.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.585
- Fuck.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.254
Who called you?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.356
- We don't do that.
He called me in confidence.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.291
- I'm your fucking wife.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.192
- You have the same rule.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.464
- If you give something
you get something.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.132
- You trading for sex now?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.135
- No, I'm gonna give you
something you actually want.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.037
Something that helps you.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.242
- National Security Advisor
asking if you

02:54.275 --> 02:55.743
went to San Antonio.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.312
- He doesn't need to call you
to answer that question.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.215
- Nope.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.516
- They're nervous.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.586
- Real nervous.
Worried about loose lips.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.388
Wanted to know if I knew.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.458
My turn.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.595
- There's a mole...
Qudrah Petrol.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.999
- No shit, Kate.
You said useful.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.371
- [whispering]
It's not one of our moles.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.572
- Which nation?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.206
- Not nation. Group.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.409
- Which group?
- More like a parent company.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.678
- You're making me work pretty
hard for my slice, Kaitlyn.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.113
- That's because you're not
asking the right questions.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.650
- Not a nation, not a state.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.486
- You call it a group.
- Mm-hm.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.554
- Parent company,
which means there's a lot

03:40.588 --> 03:42.189
of little companies--

03:42.222 --> 03:43.624
- What are the two tallest
buildings in New York?

03:43.656 --> 03:45.526
- Today?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.795
One World Trade Center
and Central Park Tower.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.196
- Groups like these
are the reason

03:49.228 --> 03:51.399
they're the tallest buildings.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.335
- That's your mole.
- That's my mole.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.270
He runs a sort of...

03:56.304 --> 03:58.839
What we call a bank
for terrorists.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.708
- Interesting.
- Mm-hm.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.477
[music]

04:03.511 --> 04:05.713
- Not sure how it helps me.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.415
- Oh, it helps you.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.083
It helps you when we get him
because getting him

04:10.117 --> 04:11.485
puts 80 billion dollar's worth

04:11.519 --> 04:14.755
of black market oil back
on the open market.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.659
I'm gonna be late.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.594
- Kate, you're assuming
putting it back

04:20.628 --> 04:22.596
on the open market
is a good thing.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.732
- Isn't it?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.867
- It's a matter of perspective,
I suppose.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.669
- Whose perspective?

04:28.702 --> 04:30.771
- Look who's asking
the wrong questions now.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.510
[music]

05:33.701 --> 05:35.335
[music]

05:43.677 --> 05:45.245
- Welcome back, Miss Adid.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.780
- Thanks.
- Luggage in the trunk?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.348
- I travel light.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.560
Do I just...

05:59.593 --> 06:00.628
Can I go in?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.296
- Please.
- Thanks.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.205
- Zara!

06:14.875 --> 06:18.211
We must hurry or they won't
have time to do everything.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.680
- What's everything?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.582
- You'll see.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.220
Come on.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.226
[inhales]
Ah!

06:36.764 --> 06:38.999
Ooh...

06:39.032 --> 06:40.834
Ow.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.706
Damn it.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.341
- If they only knew the pain
of looking beautiful.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.943
- If only I'd known.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.411
How often do you do this?

06:54.314 --> 06:57.985
- You've never been to a spa?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.988
- I'm... Weird about people.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.724
I don't like being poked at.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.325
- You've never had a facial?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.462
- No.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.630
- But you've been to Hammam.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.565
- No.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.933
- How no?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.301
- We don't have money.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.903
- You have money
to shop in Kuwait.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.672
- My uncle has money.

07:18.706 --> 07:22.776
And to auction me off to
a husband, he spent some.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.412
My fanciest dinner
was with you.

07:25.445 --> 07:30.951
My first ride in
a jet was with you.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.053
First ride in a fucking
Range Rover was with you.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.555
[laughs]

07:34.588 --> 07:36.890
Sorry, I don't mean to swear.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.727
- God gave you to
the wrong family, I think.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.363
Or there was a mix-up at the
hospital the day you were born.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.865
[chuckles]

07:44.898 --> 07:47.000
You deserve all those things.

07:51.505 --> 07:56.376
I think your uncle is the wrong
man to find you a husband.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.612
I think that's my new job.

07:58.646 --> 08:03.450
But it will be tricky:
No Ehsans for you.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.452
You will need a dreamer.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.888
But dreamers don't have money.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.559
It's okay, I find
you a dreamer with money.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.326
There has to be one.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.997
I can't promise you handsome
and money and dreamer,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.332
but I'll get you two
of the three.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.501
- I don't care about money.

08:21.535 --> 08:25.005
- That's because
you've never had any.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.807
Describe to me your perfect man,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.676
so when I'm shopping
I know what to look for.

08:29.376 --> 08:34.014
- Uh...kind.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.383
Capable.

08:36.415 --> 08:38.385
Stand up for his beliefs.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.654
I don't really care
what his beliefs are

08:40.688 --> 08:42.522
as long as he
stands up for them.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.425
Stands up for me.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.729
Looks me in the eye
when he speaks.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.065
- What's he look like?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.801
- I couldn't care less.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.435
- I think it's you
who are the dreamer.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.037
- [laughs]

09:01.108 --> 09:03.143
This is easily
the most uncomfortable

09:03.176 --> 09:05.145
I've been in my life...

09:05.178 --> 09:06.747
and that's saying something.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.081
- This is to relax.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.918
And your skin will
glow like the sun.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.586
If this makes
you uncomfortable,

09:12.620 --> 09:14.888
I worry for you and the mud.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.591
- Mud?

09:18.158 --> 09:21.094
[music]

09:21.128 --> 09:23.396
- Now are you relaxed?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.111
[speaking Arabic]

10:02.135 --> 10:03.036
- Gets everywhere, doesn't it?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.038
- Oh! Shit!

10:05.072 --> 10:07.574
Yeah, it's, uh...

10:07.607 --> 10:09.509
One big damn shower.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.644
Not small.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.849
- Been in a steam before,
I'm sure.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.585
- Yeah, I've been in a steam.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
I used to box.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.123
- Box?
I don't know box.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.658
- Mulakima.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.794
- Oh, Fight?

10:26.827 --> 10:27.995
Of course you did.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.966
Was that the bruises?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.003
- I haven't done it in years.

10:36.036 --> 10:40.774
But when I did it, we would
have to sweat to make weight.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.475
Try to get real skinny
before the weigh in,

10:42.509 --> 10:44.945
and then put all the water back
in you before the fight.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.847
I've been in a steam room.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.550
Never seen one in a house,
but I know them.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.821
- But still.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.790
No car wreck.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.192
- It was a man.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.894
- Why did you let him
do that to you?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.963
- I didn't let him
do anything.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.698
- Men don't start
with beatings.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.036
They start with
shoves and slaps.

11:09.069 --> 11:13.073
Then punches,
then the beatings.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.675
If you get a beating
you let him

11:15.709 --> 11:17.577
because you didn't
leave with the slap.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.046
- It was the last beating.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.513
I made sure of it.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.249
- How did you make sure?

11:25.318 --> 11:27.654
- I hit him in the face
with an iron skillet

11:27.687 --> 11:29.222
until he didn't
have one anymore

11:29.256 --> 11:31.524
then I ran for my fucking life.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.627
- And then you came to me.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.630
- Then I came to you.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.571
- Look me in the eye and
name me your five best friends.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.906
Don't think just do it.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.574
Name them.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.077
- [exhales]

11:50.110 --> 11:52.679
- That's what I thought.
We have that in common.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.684
Now take a breath
and take your time.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.152
And name me one.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.157
- You.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.698
- I want to be.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.766
I will be.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.271
I want to be your friend.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.540
And I am the one
who stands up for you.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.945
Will you be my friend?

12:26.046 --> 12:28.315
- Yeah, I will.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.217
[chuckles]

12:30.250 --> 12:33.686
- So now we are friends.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.023
But no more lies.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.259
How can I stand up for you
if you don't tell me the truth?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.295
- No more lies.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.804
- When you were a kid
did you have sleepovers?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.973
Slumber party.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.375
Eating ice cream...
watch stupid movies

12:55.408 --> 12:58.278
then watch scary movies
then tell scary stories?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.213
- No, I didn't do any of that.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.183
- We do that tonight.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.957
[music]

13:11.691 --> 13:13.360
- What the fuck am I doing?

13:19.766 --> 13:22.135
[music]

13:24.337 --> 13:26.273
- I am fucking bored.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.943
- They only got this
one guard posted outside.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.212
And I haven't seen anyone
come to relieve this fool.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.515
Just been standing
there all damn day.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.550
- I think the detail's
following the banker.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
- If that fucker's
alone, who's watching

13:39.319 --> 13:40.854
the monitors on the inside?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.355
- You think their
system's in-house

13:42.389 --> 13:43.823
or are they feeding
into computers?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.525
- You bet, Tex.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.194
The ace of fucking spades
he's using a Nest app

13:47.227 --> 13:48.428
for his security surveillance.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.829
- That's an NSA question.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.664
- Maybe we oughta ask 'em.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.800
- Actually, it's an FBI question
this side of the pond.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.835
- It's irrelevant,
is what it is.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.204
System's closed circuit.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.571
[glass shatters]

13:58.605 --> 14:00.407
- What the fuck?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.476
- P.D.?
- P.D. knocks.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.313
[music]

14:46.319 --> 14:47.454
[grunts]

15:05.472 --> 15:06.706
[grunts]

15:06.739 --> 15:08.441
[panting]

15:10.510 --> 15:12.612
- Boy, did you pick the wrong
fucking house.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.947
- Officers, they just asked
me to drive 'em here.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.482
- We ain't officers.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.816
But you're sure gonna
wish we were.

15:18.485 --> 15:22.789
[music]

15:27.360 --> 15:30.998
- Fucking ten o'clock at night.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.966
- Yep.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.635
- You ever been iced this long?

15:35.668 --> 15:38.405
- Nine-eleven.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.473
I sat here for three days.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.279
[door opens]

15:49.116 --> 15:50.617
- Would you both step
inside, please?

15:54.787 --> 15:55.955
[exhales]

15:55.989 --> 15:57.890
- Take a seat by Byron.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.792
[door closes]

16:04.564 --> 16:05.865
[knocking]

16:08.101 --> 16:09.369
[door opens]

16:12.039 --> 16:13.673
Bring him down here.
[door closes]

16:18.811 --> 16:22.449
It's a pretty
interesting week you've had.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.819
I'd like to hear your version
of the events, Mr. McManus.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.555
- Which events are
you referring to?

16:28.588 --> 16:31.458
- We are not fucking
around today!

16:32.492 --> 16:33.993
Extraction at the border.

16:34.027 --> 16:37.430
Kill mission in San Antonio.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.366
Your version now.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.471
- I'm unaware of any
border extraction.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.607
I had a safe house in
San Antonio under surveillance.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.677
- You are not authorized to
order surveillance on U.S. soil.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.481
- The request for surveillance
was made to the ATF through NSA.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.915
- Why ATF, why not the FBI?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.686
- ATF chases bombs, sir.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.122
FBI chases headlines.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.856
- [chuckles]

17:03.890 --> 17:05.791
- Picked up footage of
a lieutenant for Maher Al Agal

17:05.825 --> 17:07.493
at the San Antonio residence.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.863
Contacted ATF, FBI,
San Antonio P.D.,

17:10.896 --> 17:14.401
alerted them, and then
advised on a capture mission.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.104
The Al Qaeda team engaged SWAT,
neutralized the threat,

17:17.137 --> 17:22.075
and then discovered explosives
determined too volatile to move

17:22.108 --> 17:24.544
so they were destroyed in place.

17:24.577 --> 17:28.448
- [chuckles]

17:28.481 --> 17:32.018
I have heard some bullshit
in my time, I'll tell you.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.423
But that is...

17:36.456 --> 17:39.492
Bravo.
You got a real winner here.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.730
It takes local police an hour
to get their shit together

17:43.763 --> 17:46.966
with a live shooter
in a fucking school.

17:46.999 --> 17:51.571
You want me to believe that they
dumped six Al Qaeda fighters

17:51.604 --> 17:53.940
in less than 90 seconds?

17:53.973 --> 17:55.542
I saw the video.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.077
The NSA didn't just put
cameras in the house,

17:58.111 --> 18:01.114
they parked a fucking
satellite over it.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.983
- You know, I was impressed
with them as well, sir.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.519
- It was cute the first time.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.991
Care to give us your version?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.726
- I don't have a version, sir.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.495
- You saying you
weren't there?

18:15.528 --> 18:19.799
- I was there to identify
Mohamed Mahmoud.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.901
However, the decision
to detonate the residence

18:21.934 --> 18:23.102
made that impossible.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.840
- So we're all just
going to pretend that

18:27.874 --> 18:32.879
a CIA quick reaction force
did not execute a kill mission

18:32.912 --> 18:35.081
in front of CBS fucking news.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.518
- Secretary Mullins, I'm
confused, did CBS News report

18:38.551 --> 18:41.087
that a CIA QRF operated
within the borders

18:41.120 --> 18:42.989
of the United States?
I've not heard that.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.925
- No, they didn't.
They're too busy filming

18:45.958 --> 18:47.894
the victory lap
that the local police

18:47.927 --> 18:49.762
is taking for saving the city.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.031
- Isn't that the most important
thing: that the city was saved?

18:52.064 --> 18:54.000
- It's the most important
thing to the city.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.737
The most important thing for me
is protecting my President

18:57.770 --> 19:01.608
from a CIA team
operating on U.S. soil.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.810
- There doesn't seem to be
any evidence of that.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.613
- There's evidence
everywhere I look:

19:06.646 --> 19:08.248
I've got a director
of operations and two

19:08.281 --> 19:12.685
senior case officers on
the ground in Texas at a time

19:12.719 --> 19:15.755
when a kill mission
is executed in a manner

19:15.788 --> 19:19.526
that no U.S. police force
is trained to do.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.861
- That is not evidence,
that is speculation.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.832
- Is it your testimony that
there is zero physical

19:25.865 --> 19:28.735
or digital evidence
of your involvement

19:28.768 --> 19:30.670
in a mission in San Antonio?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.239
- Is that what I'm doing, here?
I'm testifying?

19:32.272 --> 19:35.007
- If evidence surfaces,
you will be.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.676
I can promise you.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.110
- There is no
evidence to surface.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.113
- We are not the
only people studying this.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.183
You know Russia
is going to come down

19:44.217 --> 19:47.720
so fast on every police officer
involved in this investigation.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.723
And I would love to meet
the watch commander

19:50.757 --> 19:54.093
who can resist the race horse
of a woman they will sic on him.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.662
- So what would you
like to do here?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.664
Should we turn this over
to Senate Intelligence

19:57.697 --> 19:59.766
and have a hearing?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.067
It's going to be hard
to prosecute

20:01.100 --> 20:03.102
because it's such a win.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.604
Americans have seen
the consequences

20:04.637 --> 20:06.239
of fumbling intelligence.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.242
Let's not forget the Jordanian
intelligence warned us of

20:09.276 --> 20:13.112
an airborne terrorist attack
two months before 9-11.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.882
Did we know the flight schools

20:15.915 --> 20:19.286
where the terrorists
trained? Yes.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.620
Did we know the names
and locations

20:20.653 --> 20:23.122
of two of
the terrorists? Yes.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.292
Does sending a team and
neutralizing those threats

20:25.325 --> 20:28.060
look like a good idea
in the rear view mirror?

20:28.094 --> 20:30.330
Four shy of
three thousand died here.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.132
God knows how many died
in Afghanistan over the years.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.868
That is what was avoided here.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.237
They had enough explosives
to blow up the Alamodome,

20:38.271 --> 20:42.809
which was hosting an Elton John
concert that very weekend.

20:42.842 --> 20:47.113
That venue holds
64,000 people.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.148
I'll let that sink
in for a minute.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.352
So, we can keep playing
this game,

20:52.385 --> 20:54.721
but what I'd really like to
is go back to my office

20:54.754 --> 20:57.924
and hand out T-shirts that say
"You're goddam right we did it."

20:57.957 --> 21:00.993
[music]

21:01.027 --> 21:03.796
But you're never going
to be able to prove it.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.197
Give it your best shot.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.972
- [whispering]
I think we could do just that.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.614
- Thank you, Agent McManus.
That will be all.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.824
- Next order of business.
[door closes]

21:35.027 --> 21:36.829
[music]
Something you forgot to tell us?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.399
- I updated you on our progress
at last month's briefing.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.300
- Quite a bit has
happened since then.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.669
- Are you close?

21:42.702 --> 21:43.670
- Closer than we've ever been.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.004
- How close?

21:45.037 --> 21:48.875
- I have someone embedded
with a next of kin.

21:48.908 --> 21:52.278
- Is someone a contract
agent or a Lioness?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.846
- A Lioness, sir.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.349
- If she's able to makes contact
with the target,

21:56.383 --> 21:58.718
what are her directives then?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.820
- Neutralize the target
if possible.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.789
If not we can send the QRF,

22:02.822 --> 22:04.791
or depending on the location
we can use a drone,

22:04.824 --> 22:07.460
possibly a tomahawk depending on
the target's proximity

22:07.494 --> 22:09.896
to our fleet in
the Mediterranean.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.331
- How does she request
authorization for that?

22:12.365 --> 22:13.833
- She's been green since
she first made contact

22:13.866 --> 22:15.001
with her mark.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.903
- We need to assume
that authority.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.238
- No, it doesn't
work like that.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.874
Once she's embedded,
we don't have access to her.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.743
We can only keep
eyes her on from a distance,

22:23.776 --> 22:26.713
but that's all we can do without
jeopardizing the mission.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.281
- Well, then how can she order
a missile strike?

22:29.315 --> 22:31.751
- She doesn't.
I do.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.453
- Without being able to
contact the Lioness?

22:33.486 --> 22:35.722
- No, sir.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.391
- Are you saying the Lioness
is collateral damage?

22:38.425 --> 22:41.293
- Collateral damage
is unintended.

22:41.327 --> 22:44.864
I'm saying it's a casualty
of the situation.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.399
- A sacrifice.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.800
- Yes, ma'am.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.504
- What a lovely war.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.940
- And what is the anticipated
point of contact?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.408
- A wedding.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.209
- Location?
- Unknown.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.978
Even to the bride.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.113
But we do have a date.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.515
December 7th.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.216
- Ironic.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.419
We're naming this mission
Operation Yellow Jacket.

23:06.453 --> 23:10.757
Your authorization code
to launch or execute is "Mabel."

23:10.790 --> 23:12.825
I repeat, Mabel.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.027
- And how am I supposed
to relay that to the Lioness

23:15.061 --> 23:16.362
when I have no contact with her?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.797
- Not my problem.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.398
Once they depart
for the wedding,

23:19.432 --> 23:21.968
command of this operation will
move to the situation room.

23:22.001 --> 23:26.105
You will both oversee
from there, understood?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.407
- Why are you taking
over our operation?

23:28.441 --> 23:32.078
- Because your team had
a fire-fight on the interstate

23:32.111 --> 23:35.982
then executed a kill mission
in Middle America

23:36.015 --> 23:39.418
then blew up a fucking house
to destroy the evidence.

23:39.452 --> 23:43.422
You can do that kind of shit
all you want in Syria.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.124
You don't get to do it here.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.896
You can go and make those
T-shirts now, Byron.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.864
[Hollar] That's all.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.965
[Mason] Thank you.
[Hollar] Thanks for coming.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.137
[music]

23:58.170 --> 23:59.939
- What the fuck
was that about?

23:59.972 --> 24:02.108
- Not here.
Meet me in Langley.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.310
- Kaitlyn.
- Not another fucking word.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.845
[phone vibrates]

24:08.481 --> 24:10.550
- My team.
- Not the place.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.823
- [sighs]
I need ten minutes.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.324
[Two Cups] This problem
will still be here.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.536
[Man] Oh, shit.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.870
[Woman] Oh my God.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.610
[Man] You know what?

24:37.644 --> 24:39.946
There's footsteps in but
there's no footsteps out.

24:39.979 --> 24:44.416
[Woman] Oh, God.
- What the fuck?!

24:44.450 --> 24:46.485
- Micah!
Micah! Micah!

24:46.519 --> 24:48.688
[screaming]

24:48.721 --> 24:51.490
- Oh! Why the fuck
are we watching this?

24:51.524 --> 24:53.826
I'm gonna have to sleep with
the fucking lights on.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.963
- Micah!
[sobbing]

24:56.996 --> 24:59.131
- That's it?
That's the end of the movie?

24:59.165 --> 25:00.767
- Not yet.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.739
[screams]

25:06.773 --> 25:08.775
[laughing]

25:08.808 --> 25:10.442
That's the end of the movie.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.179
- Why would anyone pay to
have the shit scared

25:13.212 --> 25:14.681
out of them for two hours?

25:14.714 --> 25:16.616
I'm gonna
need therapy after that.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.718
- It's like the roller coaster.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.019
Why do you ride
the roller coaster?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.621
- I don't ride
the rollercoaster.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.089
- Scared of rollercoasters.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.025
- No, I'm not fucking scared
of the rollercoaster.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.028
I'm scared of the 18 year-old
making minimum wage

25:29.061 --> 25:30.630
to operate it.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.532
- Now we have
to watch something funny or sad

25:33.566 --> 25:34.901
to get it out of our brains.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.737
Which one?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.806
- I don't want to watch
something depressing

25:39.839 --> 25:40.940
after being traumatized.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.043
- Romance then.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.412
- Um, "Notebook."
You seen "The Notebook?"

25:48.180 --> 25:49.849
- I haven't seen anything.
- Okay.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.622
Well, now you will cry,
but a good cry,

25:55.655 --> 25:58.190
a "love exists in the world"
kind of cry.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.760
- [Cruz laughs]
- [movie music plays]

26:06.866 --> 26:08.167
- I think I'm drunk.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.170
Are you drunk?

26:11.203 --> 26:12.504
- No.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.876
- One of those legs
must be hollow.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.211
[movie music plays]

26:22.615 --> 26:25.818
[music]

26:28.855 --> 26:30.089
[phone rings]

26:33.092 --> 26:34.661
- What's the problem?

26:34.694 --> 26:36.863
- Uh, group of three tried
to rob the house.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.265
We're holding them now.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.500
- This fucking day.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.235
- Assuming you don't want us
calling local P.D.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.604
- I definitely do not
want you doing that.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.573
[deep breath]

26:47.606 --> 26:48.675
Hold on.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.945
[phone vibrates]

26:55.948 --> 26:58.517
- Well, that was
pretty fun, huh?

26:58.550 --> 27:00.052
- What are you doing?

27:00.086 --> 27:02.655
- I am about to
get really drunk.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.591
- I would hold off on that.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.126
- Mm. I'm pretty committed.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.161
- Remember that favor
you fucking owe me?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.997
- Yeah.

27:11.030 --> 27:14.166
- I need it.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.136
- Can you describe
the problem over the phone?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.672
- My friends ran into
some wayward young men.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.574
I need those men to get
amnesia real fucking fast.

27:24.610 --> 27:27.546
- Where am I going?
- Hamptons.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.581
- Is Kaitlyn gonna
clear me a jet

27:29.615 --> 27:31.050
or do I have to drive
for seven hours?

27:31.083 --> 27:34.553
- Can you get him a jet?

27:34.586 --> 27:35.855
The jet will be ready.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.589
[snaps fingers]

27:37.623 --> 27:40.092
- All right, what's my budget
on hush money?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.895
- If it's more than ten apiece
they'll just buy a car

27:42.929 --> 27:45.331
wreck it and tell the police
everything.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.333
- Ten.
- I'm on my way.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.835
- I'll text you the address.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.136
- Text it to the burner.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.047
- [man laughing]
- Congressman.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.783
There's a reporter for the Post
over my left shoulder.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.220
- Thank you.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.856
- Just doing my part.

28:12.725 --> 28:16.763
[music]

28:21.300 --> 28:22.668
- I don't buy it.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.704
They were too upset.

28:25.738 --> 28:28.007
And that was too big a win.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.076
- San Antonio is the excuse.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.078
They don't have
the resolve on Amrohi.

28:32.111 --> 28:36.148
- He funnels money to
ISIS, Taliban, Hezbollah,

28:36.182 --> 28:41.320
any terrorist group with
their hand out he funds.

28:41.353 --> 28:44.223
Sunni, Shia,
he doesn't give a shit.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.926
I'm surprised the Saudis
haven't killed him themselves.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.228
- The only thing
that makes sense is

28:49.261 --> 28:52.999
they want the region
destabilized.

28:53.032 --> 28:56.402
Us too, I guess.

28:56.435 --> 29:00.139
- I don't see a single
political benefit from that.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.941
I certainly don't see
the human rights benefit.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.309
- I don't either.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.777
But that's how
this is presenting

29:04.811 --> 29:06.012
and we have to figure out why.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.288
[music]

29:17.589 --> 29:19.358
[car approaching]

29:19.391 --> 29:21.928
- I need to go to the bathroom.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.295
- Piss your pants.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.605
[Bobby] Oh, shit.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.707
I'm not cleaning that shit up.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.409
[door opens, closes]

29:37.443 --> 29:41.480
- Jesus!
This looks like fun.

29:43.415 --> 29:47.319
You know why they get you
sitting on your heels like that?

29:47.353 --> 29:48.821
[whimpering]

29:48.855 --> 29:50.489
'Cause your legs fall asleep
from the knees down.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.224
So if you try
to get up and run,

29:52.258 --> 29:53.692
you fall flat on
your fucking face.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.194
Sit the fuck down!

29:57.796 --> 30:02.501
Only people who know that
little trick are professionals.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.971
You know what I mean
when I say professionals?

30:05.004 --> 30:10.276
They make a living
out of pursuing, detaining,

30:10.309 --> 30:13.579
and neutralizing threats
posed by others.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.284
Who we got?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.820
Lucky for you...

30:21.854 --> 30:23.355
Damian.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.693
212 Spring Street, Farmingdale.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.431
Lucky for you,
I'm going to do a DNA swab

30:32.464 --> 30:35.267
of the inside
of your cheek, Damian.

30:35.301 --> 30:38.237
You're not much of a threat,
but you're a fucking nuisance.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.542
- Open your mouth.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.711
- Were they armed?

30:45.744 --> 30:47.679
- Pistols.
We got em over there.

30:47.713 --> 30:48.881
- I'll take em with me.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.316
- All right, open up,
and say ah.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.283
Open up.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.319
Open your mouth.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.386
- Aah.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.492
- All right, here's the deal
we are going to make.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.595
Hold your hands
out in front of you.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.867
Fucking hold your hands up
in front of you!

31:10.469 --> 31:11.971
It's not that hard.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.373
- Fucking hold your hands out.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.574
- Tonight shouldn't
be a complete waste of time.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.976
I mean, you came
here for something,

31:17.009 --> 31:19.778
so [laughs] you should
fucking get something.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.348
- Oh God, oh God,
oh God, oh God!

31:25.484 --> 31:29.555
Hey...you should fucking
get something, right?

31:32.624 --> 31:35.394
Hm. Do you know
what that is?

31:35.427 --> 31:36.828
That's money.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.401
But if I ever see
you here again,

31:42.434 --> 31:45.704
we're gonna
consider you a threat.

31:45.737 --> 31:49.641
And if you speak
of this...

31:49.675 --> 31:51.510
to anyone...
- [whimpering]

31:51.543 --> 31:53.079
- I'll consider you
an even bigger threat.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.849
[exhales]
Yeah.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.552
And then we're gonna
have to assume

32:00.586 --> 32:02.955
that you spoke
to your families and...

32:02.989 --> 32:05.391
and now
they're a threat too.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.762
I made it pretty clear
what we do to threats,

32:10.796 --> 32:11.763
didn't I, Damian? Yeah? Yeah?

32:11.797 --> 32:13.632
- Yes, yes, you did.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.436
- I want to hear you say it.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.640
- You...you...you kill them.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.710
- We fucking do.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.378
[chuckles]

32:28.047 --> 32:30.549
[sighs]

32:30.582 --> 32:32.818
All right, then.
[pats Damian on back]

32:32.851 --> 32:35.087
I think we can turn
these little pigeons loose now.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.990
- All right. Stand up.
Let's go.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.425
- Stand up.
- Up, up, up.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.793
- Get your ass up.
- Get up.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.095
- Turn to your left.
- Stay, stay.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.763
- All right, there you go.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.465
Hands on the shoulders of
the man in front of you.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.867
Damian, you're the lead.
Keep your hands by your side.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.037
Walk forward until
I tell you to stop.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.405
Follow my voice.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.741
[Randy] Steps. Steps.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.543
- I smell like piss now.
[Randy] Steps.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.810
- Fuck.

32:58.844 --> 33:02.048
- [whimpering]

33:02.081 --> 33:03.782
- Come on, come on.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.883
All right.
Stop.

33:05.951 --> 33:06.952
Turn to the right.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.094
You will walk forward
to your car, you will get in,

33:15.127 --> 33:16.862
you will drive away.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.764
You will not look back in
the direction of the house.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.700
Do you understand?
[All] Yes.

33:21.733 --> 33:22.834
Walk.

33:24.636 --> 33:25.871
- What about our shoes?

33:25.904 --> 33:27.973
- They're our shoes now.
Fuck your shoes.

[movie music playing]

33:48.194 --> 33:50.229
[crying]

34:02.408 --> 34:04.176
- I said that you would cry.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.348
- You said it was a good cry.
This is fucking heartbreaking.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.121
- But they knew love.

34:16.155 --> 34:19.257
Can't have heartbreak
if you don't have love.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.293
- It's just so fucking sad.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.502
- I'll never know love.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.438
But I guess I'll never know
heartbreak either.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.214
- Don't marry him.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.185
- It's not my choice.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.154
- It is absolutely your choice.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.054
- You are not Arab.

34:51.690 --> 34:55.194
You may have Arab ancestry,
but you were raised here.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.395
You live here.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.531
- You live here.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.732
- I play here.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.569
[voice breaking]
When I am married

35:03.602 --> 35:06.138
I will live in Riyadh.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.308
In my country, my culture,

35:09.341 --> 35:13.279
to say no is to
shame both families.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.515
I would be taken back to
Riyadh, locked away or killed.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.288
For me to choose love
would be the death of me.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.792
[crying]

35:29.295 --> 35:31.497
- My turn, I guess.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.413
- You ever been in love?

35:48.847 --> 35:50.216
- No.

35:54.386 --> 35:57.856
- I would love to feel
it just once.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.360
- Me, too.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.731
a little wheelchair
friendly in here.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.370
- I can see that.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.340
- What time is it?
- It's late.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.177
- Too late for a night cap?

36:54.646 --> 36:56.548
- It's never too late
for a night cap.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.622
How was she today?

37:04.990 --> 37:07.293
- Today was rough.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.695
Backed off the morphine
so she's sore.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.501
- Sorry I wasn't there.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.269
- I told her
today was gonna be tough.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.639
- She was okay with that?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.741
- Well, whatever
you said worked.

37:25.477 --> 37:26.945
She is gonna need more
of you, though.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.447
- Yeah, I know.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.884
I know.

[music]

37:43.962 --> 37:46.732
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.502
- No more Band-Aids, okay?

37:53.905 --> 37:56.274
Just you and me from now on.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.378
- I'd like that.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.847
- Oh, good.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.916
We should probably
bank a few sessions

38:04.950 --> 38:06.685
before I have to go overseas.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.687
- I think that's
a really good idea.

Wooo!

They have chosen a place for
the wedding: Mallorca!

38:58.404 --> 39:00.439
Mallorca! Ha ha!

39:00.472 --> 39:02.007
- That's good?

- It's the most beautiful
