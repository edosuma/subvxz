WEBVTT

00:03.458 --> 00:06.375
Mr. Hune,
you can't kick us out!

00:06.375 --> 00:10.750
I can do anything I want.
I own the building.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.291
Dad, why are you
yelling at the landlord?

00:13.291 --> 00:15.000
Remember, we put
holes in the walls,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.333
and we cover them
with posters.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.333
Alex...
we're being evicted.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.833
"Evicted"
sounds so mean.

00:22.833 --> 00:26.458
I'd prefer to say "Giving you
a chance to live somewhere

00:26.458 --> 00:30.500
- that's not here."
- That's still mean.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.375
You just said it
in a nice way.

00:34.083 --> 00:37.291
Listen, Mr. Hune,
our Sub Station provides

00:37.291 --> 00:39.458
a very valuable service
to the community.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.708
Where else
are people gonna eat

00:40.708 --> 00:43.708
when they want to call in sick
to work the next day?

00:43.708 --> 00:47.083
Mr. Hune, you don't want
to kick my family out

00:47.083 --> 00:50.625
on the street.
Just look at them.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.166
Look, if your dad

01:02.166 --> 01:04.833
hadn't sold me
this building in 1957,

01:04.833 --> 01:06.416
you wouldn't
be in this mess.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.833
- So blame your dad, not me.
- Nice going, Dad.

01:09.833 --> 01:13.500
Wha... No, his dad,
our grandpa.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.583
Oh, Grandpa Russo.
I love him.

01:16.583 --> 01:19.208
He always pulls a jellybean
out of my ear when I see him.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.625
'Cause I always
got one in there.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.500
You have 30 days
to pack up and get out.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.625
Wha... wait!

01:28.625 --> 01:31.375
Would this jellybean
change your mind?

01:33.458 --> 01:35.875
Fifteen days.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.958
I got us 15 days.
Fifteen days!

02:31.458 --> 02:33.708
We can't lose our home.

02:33.708 --> 02:38.000
I just had a bunch of return
address stickers printed up.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.208
Look, maybe this
is a good thing.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.458
Maybe we can finally
move to a place

02:42.458 --> 02:44.083
that doesn't have
a spiral staircase

02:44.083 --> 02:47.750
where customers can walk
directly into our living room.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.958
Theresa, we can
find another home.

02:49.958 --> 02:53.000
The real problem is we
can't find another lair.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.875
That's right.
If we lose the lair,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.708
we'll lose all contact
from the Wizard World.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.750
How are we gonna get there
without a portal?

02:59.750 --> 03:02.000
Well, what if we just
shrunk down our lair

03:02.000 --> 03:05.125
with our magic stick thingies
and packed it in a suitcase?

03:05.125 --> 03:08.250
- Magic stick thingies?
- Yeah.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.583
They're called wands, Max.
What's the matter with you?

03:11.583 --> 03:16.583
I shrunk my brain down so I
could fit in more jellybeans.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.583
Well, make it big again.

03:26.166 --> 03:29.208
Look, we can't
shrink the lair.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.583
My great-great-grandfather
chose this place

03:32.583 --> 03:34.291
for the Russo family
wizard lair,

03:34.291 --> 03:35.750
and we're not allowed
to move it.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.708
Actually, Dad,
there's a solution.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.458
We can appeal to
the Wizard Council.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.875
Come on.
To the lair!

03:42.875 --> 03:45.166
Really? We're gonna
follow someone that says...

03:45.166 --> 03:48.000
..."To the lair"?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.208
The Department of
Lair Relocation Services

03:50.208 --> 03:52.125
can fix all of this.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.583
Abraca-doodler,

03:55.583 --> 03:57.708
one lair relocation
application, please.

04:04.416 --> 04:06.291
All right, page one...

04:06.291 --> 04:10.000
...of four thousand!
Come on!

04:10.000 --> 04:13.125
That's gonna take
you guys months to fill out.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.500
We don't have months.
We have 15 days.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.625
Fifteen days.
You are welcome.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.583
OK, all right,
this is ridiculous.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.583
Why don't we just
go back in time

04:26.583 --> 04:28.875
and tell Grandpa not to sell
the building to Lenny Hune?

04:28.875 --> 04:30.000
Boom. Problem solved.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.875
Alex, time travelling
can be very hazardous.

04:32.875 --> 04:33.875
Whatever we do in the past

04:33.875 --> 04:35.833
can negatively affect
the present day

04:35.833 --> 04:37.875
by causing ripples
in the Fabric of Time.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.875
Besides, we don't even
have to worry about that,

04:39.875 --> 04:41.416
because we don't have
a time travel device.

04:41.416 --> 04:44.458
- Actually, we do.
- Come again?

04:44.458 --> 04:47.291
I didn't want to
tell you guys about it,

04:47.291 --> 04:49.458
because I didn't want
anyone to be tempted,

04:49.458 --> 04:52.000
but it seems like
our only option.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Ah, we time travel through
a mysterious crystal orb.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Looks like it didn't work out
too well for the last guy.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.875
No, no, no, honey, this is
actually a bowling ball

05:02.875 --> 05:06.000
that your father bought
when he was gonna go pro.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.500
That could still happen,
Theresa.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.000
Here it is,
My First Time Machine.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The time travelling device
looks like a kid's toy?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.500
That could be dangerous.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.458
Could you imagine how many kids
are lost in time right now?

05:22.458 --> 05:25.458
There you guys are.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.458
Wait a minute.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.000
Is this another
meeting about me?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.458
'Cause you all agreed to
let me stay in the basement

05:30.458 --> 05:32.208
until I graduate.
Just let it go.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.458
Harper, we have to go back
in time to save the lair.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.500
Are you in?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.583
Well, it has been awhile
since I've been on

05:38.583 --> 05:40.958
a madcap adventure
with you guys. Why not?

05:40.958 --> 05:44.125
OK. So, Grandpa sold
the building in 1957, right?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.458
No, no, no, you guys!
Just wait.

05:45.458 --> 05:47.000
There's a safer
alternative here.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.416
Look, look.
We are on page three.

05:49.416 --> 05:54.125
Oh, paper jam! Come on!

05:54.125 --> 05:56.166
OK, everybody,
we're leaving.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.000
- Where to?
- 1957.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.458
I've heard of that place.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.875
No, Alex, what
are you doing?!

06:07.875 --> 06:12.750
Wait, this isn't 1957.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.458
We traveled to 1977.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.000
Justin, you must have
bumped the arrow

06:17.000 --> 06:19.125
when you got all grabby
with this thing.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.583
I'm only trying to
save our universe.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.083
Jerry, we know this song.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.625
Come on, let's shake our
groove things before we go.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.625
I can dig it.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.166
No! No one is shaking
their groove things.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.583
Oh, come on, Justin.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.958
We can't let these fine threads
go to waste. Let's boogie.

06:35.958 --> 06:39.125
We can change the future.
We need to get out of here.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.125
I do love this song, though.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.750
OK, that's enough of
the bump. Let's go.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.875
Hey. This is
my dad's old diner.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.750
Yeah, I've seen this place
in pictures.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.875
They should've kept it
black and white.

07:15.875 --> 07:19.375
Nice glasses, nerd.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.416
Actually, in the 50s
we're called "poindexters,"

07:22.416 --> 07:23.583
but you're still
called annoying.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.583
Jerry, is that
your father?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.500
Oh, my gosh,
he's so young.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.166
Hey! Customers!

07:36.375 --> 07:38.458
Can I interest you
in today's special,

07:38.458 --> 07:40.000
hamburger soup.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.833
In case you're wondering,
it has nothing to do

07:41.833 --> 07:44.125
with yesterday's special,
hamburgers.

07:44.125 --> 07:47.083
He's brilliant.

07:47.083 --> 07:50.208
Yeah, that's definitely
your dad, Dad.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.166
- Oh.
- Ooh, oh!

07:52.166 --> 07:53.875
Don't hurt me.
Just take the money.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.708
There's 14 dollars
in the register.
It's all I've got!

07:58.250 --> 08:02.583
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Uh... I'm your son.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.291
My son?
But I don't have any kids.

08:05.291 --> 08:09.166
I'm not even married.
And you're older than me.

08:09.166 --> 08:12.750
Wait... Is that a
My First Time Machine?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.000
Yes.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.416
We used this to travel
from the future.

08:16.416 --> 08:19.583
You gave this to me as
part of my wizard training.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.000
I did?
You are my son.

08:23.958 --> 08:28.166
Yes! I'm not going
to die alone!

08:28.166 --> 08:32.083
- Uh, Grandpa, I'm waiting.
- For what?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.958
For you to pull the
jellybean out of my ear.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.000
Tell me I'm not related
to this one.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.583
Don't tell him in the future he
actually eats those jellybeans.

08:40.583 --> 08:43.083
This is your
grandson, Max.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.000
And this is your
other grandson, Justin.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.250
And this is your
granddaughter, Alex.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.375
And I'm Harper.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.000
Just a friend who lives
in their basement.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.500
In the basement?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.708
So, in the future, they
get rid of the ghosts?

08:56.708 --> 08:59.833
I told you people
I wasn't seeing things.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.416
Nice to see you, Hank.
I'm Theresa.

09:03.416 --> 09:06.208
Oh, my, uh...
wife in the future?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.708
No, Dad.

09:07.708 --> 09:09.458
Actually, she's my wife
in the future.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.583
Do I find a wife
as beautiful as her?

09:11.583 --> 09:13.833
Well, a lot of people say
I look just like Mom.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.875
Oh, jeepers.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.083
You must be hungry after
all that time travel.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.166
Why don't you
take a load off,

09:19.166 --> 09:20.750
and I'll cook you up
some grub.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.875
Oh, how much for
a bottle of water?

09:22.875 --> 09:26.458
You want me to fill
a bottle with water

09:26.458 --> 09:28.208
and charge you for it?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.958
OK, but it sounds
a little kooky.

09:30.958 --> 09:33.458
Oh, yeah. See in the future,
people pay a ton of money for...

09:33.458 --> 09:36.708
Shh! You're messing with
the Fabric of Time.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.250
No more talking
about the future.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.250
OK, look, let's get
down to business.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.291
Grandpa,
sometime this year,

09:43.291 --> 09:45.333
a man named Lenny Hune will
offer to buy your building.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.166
And don't sell it to him,

09:47.166 --> 09:49.208
because he's going to
evict us in the future,

09:49.208 --> 09:52.083
- and our lair will disappear.
- No lair?

09:52.083 --> 09:56.291
A wizard without a lair is like
a telephone without a cord.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.000
Don't worry, kids.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.500
Your grandpa won't sell
this building to Lenny Hune.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.291
Wow, "Grandpa."
Ain't that a kick?

10:07.083 --> 10:10.250
All right now, let's
get out of here, guys,

10:10.250 --> 10:12.583
before someone tells Grandpa
about the Internet.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.750
What's the Internet?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.458
I've said too much.

10:18.625 --> 10:19.958
Bye, Grandpa.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.250
- Bye, Hank.
- Bye, Grandpa.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.083
Oh, look,
there's a poodle.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.125
You know your skirt
would look so much cuter

10:29.125 --> 10:30.708
with a poodle on it.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.875
Oh, no.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.583
Hey.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.250
What happened to
the Sub Station?

10:45.250 --> 10:47.250
Dad, are we back
in our own time?

10:47.250 --> 10:50.083
Yeah, we're here,
the same day as we left.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.291
But without
the subway car!

10:54.958 --> 10:58.333
Oh, I'm sorry. I should've
said that with a sad voice.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.500
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.000
Something we did in the past

11:03.000 --> 11:05.583
must have affected
our present day.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.583
The lair.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.208
The lair's gone.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.208
You guys should've filled out
that application.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.583
Something we did in 1957

11:26.583 --> 11:28.458
caused a ripple
through the Fabric of Time

11:28.458 --> 11:30.625
and made our lair
not exist in the present.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.833
OK, well then, we'll
just have to go back to 1957

11:33.833 --> 11:35.583
and figure out
what we did wrong.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.125
Oh, that's a brilliant idea.
We're gonna solve the problem

11:38.125 --> 11:39.750
by doing exactly what
caused the problem.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.958
Have you not been paying
attention to anything?!

11:43.708 --> 11:46.750
Sweetie... Honey, I think
we do have to go back.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.458
- Why?
- We left Harper there.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.583
Oh, my gosh,
my best friend!

11:52.583 --> 11:56.416
- What am I gonna do?
- You didn't even notice.

11:56.416 --> 12:01.000
- I've got a lot on my mind.
- No, we're not going back.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.625
You're just gonna have
to find a new best friend.

12:04.708 --> 12:07.166
Here, Alex,
I'll help you out.

12:07.166 --> 12:08.333
What do you look for
in a best friend?

12:08.333 --> 12:09.625
You still play
with dollies or...

12:11.000 --> 12:14.333
Look, everybody, we have
to go back and fix this.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.375
We need to get
our lair back.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.166
OK, all right,
fine.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.458
But I'm not wearing those
poindexter glasses this time.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.708
Oh, good, no glasses
this time.

12:27.708 --> 12:31.166
They fell off when
you landed, Poindexter.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.875
Future family.
What's buzzing, cousins?

12:34.875 --> 12:38.166
Oh, great. I changed the past
and now we're cousins.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.458
Hank, what's
going on here?

12:40.458 --> 12:42.708
Well, as you predicted,
Lenny Hune rolled in

12:42.708 --> 12:44.875
and offered a lot of
do-re-mi for the place.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.583
But I didn't sell it,
like I promised.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.875
The problem is I didn't
get enough business.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.416
So, now I gotta
shut the place down.

12:51.416 --> 12:54.416
That's why the lair's gone.

12:54.416 --> 12:57.083
When your business failed,
you moved out of the building,

12:57.083 --> 12:59.083
and because our family
wasn't here,

12:59.083 --> 13:00.958
that's why the lair
disappeared.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.875
So, we can't let
this business fail.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.708
OK, well,
the only way to do that

13:04.708 --> 13:05.958
is to make
this place popular.

13:05.958 --> 13:09.000
There's no time.
I won't own this place tomorrow.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.625
That's when the bank
takes it over.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.458
Maybe Justin's right.
We shouldn't be here.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.875
We should just
find Harper and leave.

13:17.875 --> 13:20.875
Hank, do you have any idea
where Harper is?

13:20.875 --> 13:23.083
At my old high school,
Tribeca Prep.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.000
She enrolled there
as soon as you left.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.583
Didn't want to hurt her
perfect attendance record.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.708
I'll go get her.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.125
I want to come, too.
I want to check out my locker

13:34.125 --> 13:36.583
and see if my initials
are still there from when
I scratched them in.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.125
Max, we went back in time.
You're not even born yet.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.583
Perfect. So I'll just
scratch 'em in now

13:40.583 --> 13:41.708
so I won't have to
do it later.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.166
No, no, no! Don't go!

13:43.166 --> 13:44.625
You guys
are causing ripples.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.583
Ripples!

13:46.583 --> 13:48.750
Justin, just go!
Go with them

13:48.750 --> 13:51.875
and protect your precious
Fabric of Time.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.208
Uh, excuse me. Hi.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.000
Have you seen a girl
with red hair,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.750
and an overly peppy attitude

14:02.750 --> 14:06.083
that covers her sadness
right below the surface?

14:06.083 --> 14:08.708
So, I say,
"You better cool it, Daddy-o,

14:08.708 --> 14:10.875
'cause you're cruisin'
for a bruisin'."

14:10.875 --> 14:13.708
Harper?

14:13.708 --> 14:18.458
Ah. Gotta scram, girls.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.375
Oh, Alex,
you came back for me!

14:21.375 --> 14:23.708
Now get outta here.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.833
Well. It's nice
to see you, too.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.291
I'm super popular here.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.833
Those poodle skirts?
My idea.

14:30.833 --> 14:32.875
The girls love me.
They do whatever I say!

14:32.875 --> 14:34.625
I am not going back!

14:34.625 --> 14:37.125
Harper, your life
is in the future.

14:37.125 --> 14:39.125
If you stayed here,
you won't exist,

14:39.125 --> 14:41.583
and we won't
ever be friends.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.750
I'm OK with that.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And this little guy
holds about 10,000 songs.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.375
- Well, let me hear it.
- I forgot my headphones.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.208
Well, you know,
I don't need headphones

14:55.208 --> 14:56.958
to listen to this.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.708
No? How many songs
does it play?

14:59.708 --> 15:02.458
As many as I want.
It's the radio.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.708
Oh, my gosh,
I can hear music.

15:06.708 --> 15:09.708
And you didn't have to pay
99 cents a song?

15:09.708 --> 15:11.750
Ninety-nine cents?
What are you, rich?

15:16.291 --> 15:18.625
This radio thing
is awesome.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.708
I'm gonna go to the future
and invent that.

15:20.708 --> 15:24.000
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Whoa, hey, hey.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.625
You never done this before?

15:26.625 --> 15:29.250
- No.
- Relax. Just slap it.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.000
Give a slap.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.583
Harder.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.125
- There you go.
- Hey.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.083
What's up?

15:39.083 --> 15:40.500
What are you doing?

15:40.500 --> 15:44.208
You just invented the
high five 20 years too early.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.291
This is a horrible day.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.458
Hey, uh, Harper.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.958
You know, we're going down
to the malt shop tonight.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.208
You're coming, right?

15:53.208 --> 15:54.708
Sure, Tommy.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.416
Wait, you all hang out
at the malt shop?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.375
Yeah, the whole school
hangs out there.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.708
The whole school, huh?

16:02.708 --> 16:06.000
Hey, everybody.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.291
Harper Finkle's
got a new hangout,
the Waverly Diner.

16:09.291 --> 16:13.250
Be there or be square.

16:13.250 --> 16:16.583
You see what I did there?
I can fit in, too.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.708
Alex, what are you doing?

16:19.708 --> 16:22.583
I'm getting customers to the
diner and saving our lair.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.458
So, see you tonight!

16:24.458 --> 16:28.625
This is risky.
This is very, very risky.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.250
I'm gonna put a note
in a time capsule,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.458
so one day people will know
I wasn't a part of this.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.708
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.208
Positive. If kids
have fun at your diner,

16:43.208 --> 16:46.416
it'll be their regular hangout,
and you'll stay in business.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.708
But no one's having any fun.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.875
Oh, no.
Tommy doesn't look happy.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.458
And when Tommy's not happy,
no one's happy.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.583
He's almost as popular as me.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.750
Hey, Harper.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.250
Why do you guys
hang out here?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.875
Their jukebox
doesn't even work.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.166
Let's motor.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.708
Wait, wait.
We have music.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.208
- We do?
- Max has an mp3 player.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.250
How good are you at
rewiring electronic stuff?

17:13.250 --> 17:16.958
Intermediate to advanced.
Uh... more advanced.

17:16.958 --> 17:20.166
Hook that up to the jukebox.
Max, pull up a good playlist.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.250
We gotta get
this party started.

17:24.833 --> 17:26.500
Harper, what happened
to all my songs?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.750
- I don't know any of these.
- Your songs must have changed

17:28.750 --> 17:30.250
when we traveled
back to the 50s.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.250
Who's this Elvis guy?

17:33.250 --> 17:36.458
He'll never get far
with a name like that.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.625
Max, bring me
the mp3 player.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.333
We're ready.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.208
Come on, everybody,
let's dance!

17:48.958 --> 17:52.458
Ow! My new saddle shoes
are giving me a blister.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.083
I can't dance.

17:55.083 --> 17:58.291
Hey, why isn't anybody
dancing with us?

17:58.291 --> 18:00.583
Because we're not Harper.

18:00.583 --> 18:03.166
They do whatever
Miss Popularity does.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.208
Oh. I thought I was
Miss Popularity.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.875
Harper, you have to
dance with us.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.500
It's our only chance
to save this place.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.000
Fine,
but if I'm gonna dance,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.333
these puppies gotta run free.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.000
Everyone, dig
what Harper's doing.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.416
Dancing in her socks.
That's keen!

19:16.875 --> 19:19.250
This place is boss, Harper.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.375
We're gonna call this
a sock hop,

19:21.375 --> 19:24.458
and we're gonna make this place
our regular hangout.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.208
- Alex, you did it!
- No, we did it.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.375
Yeah, you're right,
I did it, though.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.625
Thanks for saving
the business, kids.

19:31.625 --> 19:34.708
And, more importantly,
the lair.

19:34.708 --> 19:38.125
- It was great to see you, Dad.
- I'm proud of you, son.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.583
You've done a fine job
raising this family.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.000
It's gonna be weird changing
your diapers in a few years.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.958
Ooh, and remember,
I'm allergic to talcum powder.

19:45.958 --> 19:48.333
Well, it's gonna be
your mother's problem anyway.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.458
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye, Grandpa.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.875
- Bye, Greandpa.
- Thanks, Hank!

19:51.875 --> 19:54.208
Bye!
See you in a few decades!

20:08.458 --> 20:09.708
Our lair!

20:09.708 --> 20:12.375
Our beautiful lair!

20:12.375 --> 20:15.708
Oh, the dust,
and the moldy smell.

20:18.708 --> 20:22.333
It's all here!

20:22.333 --> 20:25.333
Ah. Page five of 4,000.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.166
Who was right about
time travel? Me.

20:28.166 --> 20:31.416
Let's go check out
the Sub Station.

20:32.625 --> 20:36.375
Still no customers.
I love it!

20:37.500 --> 20:39.458
Uh, excuse me.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.000
Uh... Who are you?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.708
I'm the janitor.
Lenny Hune, Jr.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.458
Lenny Hune, Jr.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.000
Does your dad
own the building?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.875
Of course not. You do.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.208
My Dad owns a janitor service.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.500
Well, I'm done
for the day.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.833
Gimme a Max.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.583
A Max?

21:01.583 --> 21:03.500
Don't you mean a high five?

21:03.500 --> 21:06.375
What's a high five?
Ah, forget it.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.625
You left me
hanging too long.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.458
What?

21:13.833 --> 21:15.875
Oh, come on. Gimme a me.

21:19.833 --> 21:23.250
Well, Justin, I hope you
learned a valuable lesson.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.208
You can go back in time
and fix something

21:25.208 --> 21:27.000
without causing
any real problems.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.458
Really?

21:29.333 --> 21:30.708
Where's Harper?

21:34.208 --> 21:36.333
All right, well,
we have to go back.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.958
No, no, no.
Wait, wait! Alex!

21:42.750 --> 21:46.583
We're back in 1977 again!

21:48.208 --> 21:50.500
But I do love this song.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.583
Well, Harper can wait.
