WEBVTT

00:35.969 --> 00:37.704
WELCOME TO LAST WEEK

00:37.704 --> 00:38.471
TONIGHT, I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.205
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.173
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK FROM LORI

00:40.173 --> 00:41.107
LIGHTFOOT LOSING HER REELECTION

00:41.107 --> 00:42.108
BID IN CHICAGO, TO ALEC MURDAUGH

00:42.108 --> 00:42.942
BEING FOUND GUILTY OF TWO

00:42.942 --> 00:43.910
MURDERS.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.345
AND OF ALL THE ILL-ADVISED

00:45.345 --> 00:46.279
PIECES OF COMMENTARY CONCERNING

00:46.279 --> 00:47.614
THIS BLOCKBUSTER TRIAL, PERHAPS

00:50.183 --> 00:51.384
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING

00:51.384 --> 00:53.486
ME WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS, UH,

00:53.486 --> 00:55.855
ALEX MURDAUGH TRIAL.

00:55.855 --> 00:56.823
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THINK I'M

00:56.823 --> 01:02.362
AN EXPERT ON IT.

01:02.362 --> 01:05.231
I DO, BECAUSE THERE

01:05.231 --> 01:06.566
ARE EXACTLY TWO THINGS YOU HAVE

01:06.566 --> 01:10.637
EXPERTISE ON IN THIS LIFE.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.172
FOOTBALL AND MURDERING WIVES.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.474
NO ONE IS ASKING FOR YOUR TAKE

01:14.474 --> 01:15.575
ON HIS RUSHING AVERAGE SO I'M

01:15.575 --> 01:16.776
GUESSING IT'S THE SECOND ONE, WE

01:16.776 --> 01:18.478
ARE GOING TO START WITH OUR MAIN

01:18.478 --> 01:22.415
STORY TONIGHT WHICH CONCERNS

01:22.415 --> 01:23.283
RON DeSANTIS.

01:23.283 --> 01:23.850
BUSINESS FRED FLINTSTONE.

01:23.850 --> 01:24.851
DESANTIS HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE

01:24.851 --> 01:25.318
NEWS THIS WEEK, AS HE IS

01:25.318 --> 01:26.085
SEEMINGLY EVERY WEEK.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.620
HE APPOINTED

01:27.620 --> 01:29.722
HIS POLITICAL BACKERS TO A NEW

01:29.722 --> 01:30.457
DISNEY OVERSIGHT BOARD.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.124
HE RELEASED A NEW BOOK "THE

01:31.124 --> 01:32.025
COURAGE TO BE FREE.

01:32.025 --> 01:32.759
AND BY THE WAY, I HAVE

01:32.759 --> 01:33.560
A LITTLE GIFT FOR OUR STUDIO

01:33.560 --> 01:34.327
AUDIENCE, LOOK UNDER YOUR SEATS!

01:34.327 --> 01:35.261
THE GIFT IS, IT ISN'T THERE.

01:35.261 --> 01:39.032
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.301
YOU'RE WELCOME!

01:41.301 --> 01:41.968
AND HE PUT OUT THIS EYE-CATCHING

01:43.236 --> 01:48.241
FLORIDA IS PROOF POSITIVE

01:48.241 --> 01:48.842
THAT WE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:48.842 --> 01:49.909
DESTINED FOR FAILURE.

01:49.909 --> 01:50.543
DESANTIS WINS.

01:50.543 --> 01:51.311
HE HAS MADE A PROMISE, AND HE'S

01:51.311 --> 01:52.412
MAKING GOOD ON THE PROMISE.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.213
FLORIDA IS LEADING THE

01:53.213 --> 01:54.347
NATION.

01:54.347 --> 02:00.487
DECLINE IS A CHOICE.

02:00.487 --> 02:01.154
SUCCESS IS ATTAINABLE.

02:01.154 --> 02:01.754
AND FREEDOM IS WORTH FIGHTING

02:01.754 --> 02:02.455
FOR.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.490
WOW.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.925
THERE'S A LOT THERE, BUT

02:05.925 --> 02:06.626
"FLORIDA'S PROOF THAT WE THE

02:06.626 --> 02:07.327
PEOPLE ARE NOT DESTINED FOR

02:07.327 --> 02:08.461
FAILURE?"

02:08.461 --> 02:09.729
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.064
LAST YEAR ALONE IN FLORIDA, A

02:11.064 --> 02:12.365
MAN TRIED TO STEAL A CROSSBOW BY

02:12.365 --> 02:13.900
STUFFING IT DOWN HIS PANTS, A

02:13.900 --> 02:15.568
WOMAN INSTIGATED A POLICE CHASE

02:15.568 --> 02:16.803
SO SHE COULD CROSS "GETTING

02:16.803 --> 02:18.338
ARRESTED' OFF HER BUCKET LIST,

02:18.338 --> 02:19.572
AND A MAN WAS CHARGED WITH

02:19.572 --> 02:20.406
BATTERY FOR THROWING A HOT DOG

02:20.406 --> 02:22.675
AT A POLICE OFFICER.

02:22.675 --> 02:23.676
THE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE DESTINED

02:23.676 --> 02:24.544
FOR FAILURE, BUT A LOT OF

02:24.544 --> 02:26.312
INDIVIDUALS DOWN THERE SURE SEEM

02:26.312 --> 02:28.348
DRAWN TO IT.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.016
THIS FEELS LIKE A COORDINATED

02:30.016 --> 02:36.055
ROLLOUT OF HIS INEVITABLE

02:36.055 --> 02:37.323
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

02:37.323 --> 02:37.924
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE HASN'T

02:37.924 --> 02:39.893
YET ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING, HE'S

02:39.893 --> 02:41.027
ALREADY MANY CONSERVATIVES'

02:41.027 --> 02:41.928
FAVORITE CANDIDATE.

02:41.928 --> 02:42.762
AFTER HIS LANDSLIDE REELECTION

02:42.762 --> 02:43.463
AS GOVERNOR LAST NOVEMBER, THE

02:43.463 --> 02:44.664
NEW YORK POST PROCLAIMED HIM

02:44.664 --> 02:45.598
DEFUTURE.

02:45.598 --> 02:49.369
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,

02:49.369 --> 02:50.136
DEEEEEPRESSING.

02:50.136 --> 02:50.770
AND HE RECEIVED THIS CRINGE

02:50.770 --> 02:51.404
INDUCING INTRODUCTION FROM KARI

02:52.272 --> 02:53.306
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE'S GOT.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.340
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF

02:54.340 --> 02:55.375
THIS, BUT HE'S GOT B.D.E.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.845
ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

02:58.845 --> 03:02.215
ASK YOUR KIDS ABOUT IT LATER.

03:02.215 --> 03:06.986
I CALL IT BIG DESANTIS ENERGY.

03:06.986 --> 03:07.787
OKAY,

03:07.787 --> 03:08.788
THAT'S TERRIBLE, BUT JUST TO BE

03:08.788 --> 03:09.722
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT B

03:09.722 --> 03:11.224
D-E IS, PLEASE DON'T ASK YOUR

03:11.224 --> 03:13.660
KIDS ABOUT IT LATER.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.861
IN FACT, FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE

03:14.861 --> 03:16.029
KIDS, I'LL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT

03:16.029 --> 03:17.797
IT STANDS FOR BIG DICK

03:17.797 --> 03:19.232
ENERGY, A KIND OF EASY, MAGNETIC

03:19.232 --> 03:20.600
CONFIDENCE THAT DOESN'T

03:20.600 --> 03:21.935
NECESSARILY MEAN YOU HAVE A

03:21.935 --> 03:22.669
LARGE PENIS, OR, INDEED, A PENIS

03:22.669 --> 03:23.970
AT ALL.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.605
IT'S JUST THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED.

03:25.605 --> 03:26.839
A LIST OF THOSE WITH B-D-E WOULD

03:26.839 --> 03:28.007
INCLUDE

03:28.007 --> 03:30.009
BRYAN CRANSTON, CHRISTINE

03:30.009 --> 03:31.911
BARANSKI, THE PIXAR LAMP,

03:31.911 --> 03:36.849
CHARLES DARWIN, AND SNOOPY.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.585
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

03:38.585 --> 03:39.285
PLEASE COME TO ME AND NOT YOUR

03:39.285 --> 03:39.953
KIDS IF YOU HAVE ANY PENIS

03:39.953 --> 03:40.720
RELATED SLANG EXPLAINED IN THE

03:40.720 --> 03:41.754
FUTURE, IT IS WORTH NOTING IN

03:41.754 --> 03:42.989
GENERAL YOU CAN'T PREDICT MUCH

03:42.989 --> 03:45.491
ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL RACE 20

03:45.491 --> 03:47.694
MONTHS OUT, PREVIOUS EARLY

03:47.694 --> 03:48.861
FRONTRUNNERS INCLUDE JEB BUSH,

03:48.861 --> 03:52.231
THE LATE JEB BUSH?

03:52.231 --> 03:52.966
I DON'T KNOW.

03:52.966 --> 03:53.933
IT'S UNCLEAR.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.435
HOWARD DEAN AND RUDY GIULIANI

03:55.435 --> 04:01.007
WANDERING AROUND CENTRAL PARK

04:01.007 --> 04:01.975
CUPBOARD AND THOUSAND ISLAND

04:01.975 --> 04:03.242
DRESSING AND A SCREAMING ABOUT

04:03.242 --> 04:06.379
THE ELECTION FRAUD TO PIGEONS.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.580
AND RON DeSANTIS IS LIKELY TO

04:07.580 --> 04:09.949
HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST

04:09.949 --> 04:11.050
DONALD TRUMP WHICH HISTORY HAS

04:11.050 --> 04:14.253
SHOWN IS NO EASY TASK.

04:14.253 --> 04:14.988
AND WHILE TRUMP INITIALLY

04:14.988 --> 04:16.022
STRUGGLED TO COIN A DAMAGING

04:16.022 --> 04:19.292
NICKNAME FOR DESANTIS-- WITH

04:19.292 --> 04:19.859
HIS FIRST ATTEMPT BEING THE

04:19.859 --> 04:20.393
EMBARRASSINGLY WEAK "RON

04:20.393 --> 04:21.227
DESANCTIMONIOUS", HE LATER

04:21.227 --> 04:21.928
UNVEILED SOMETHING WITH A LOT

04:21.928 --> 04:22.729
MORE PUNCH.

04:22.729 --> 04:23.830
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES, TRUMP

04:23.830 --> 04:24.831
HAS SPENT WEEKS TRYING TO GOAD

04:24.831 --> 04:25.999
DESANTIS INTO A FIGHT,

04:25.999 --> 04:27.166
DESCRIBING HIM IN CONVERSATIONS

04:27.166 --> 04:29.969
AS MEATBALL RON.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.572
APPARENTLY HE WAS

04:32.572 --> 04:33.873
CALLING HIM MEATBALL RON.

04:33.873 --> 04:34.807
TRUMP'S STILL

04:34.807 --> 04:36.676
GOT IT!

04:36.676 --> 04:38.544
IT'S PERFECTLY STUPID, CHILDISH,

04:38.544 --> 04:40.079
AND HURTFUL IN A WAY THAT'S

04:40.079 --> 04:42.548
DIFFICULT TO ARTICULATE.

04:42.548 --> 04:43.516
ALSO IT'S A GOOD NAME ON ITS

04:43.516 --> 04:44.550
OWN.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.952
IF YOU'D ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE

04:45.952 --> 04:46.919
THE PERFECT "MEATBALL RON" I'D

04:46.919 --> 04:47.987
SAY I WOULD SAY A ROUND LITTLE

04:47.987 --> 04:51.557
HAMSTER.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.258
OR

04:52.258 --> 04:54.060
THIS SMILEY CARTOON CHARACTER.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.095
Y'KNOW-- LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS,

04:56.095 --> 04:56.729
LITTLE MOUSTACHE, MAYBE VOICED

04:56.729 --> 04:57.497
BY CHRIS PRATT IN A

04:57.497 --> 04:58.264
STRAIGHT-TO-STREAMING KIDS MOVIE

04:58.264 --> 04:59.332
WITH WEIRDLY CHRISTIAN

04:59.332 --> 04:59.932
UNDERTONES THAT FEELS VAGUELY

04:59.932 --> 05:01.300
ANTI-ITALIAN.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.535
BUT THEN IF YOU SIMPLY SHOWED

05:02.535 --> 05:07.206
ME THIS GUY, I'D SAY "FORGET

05:07.206 --> 05:08.041
EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, "THAT'S'

05:08.041 --> 05:09.242
MY MEATBALL RON RIGHT THERE."

05:09.242 --> 05:11.244
THAT IS MY MEATBALL.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.211
BUT WHATEVER TRUMP CALLS HIM IN

05:12.211 --> 05:13.279
THE FUTURE, THE FACT IS,

05:13.279 --> 05:14.447
MEATBALL RON REMAINS A STRONG

05:14.447 --> 05:15.682
CONTENDER FOR THE REPUBLICAN

05:15.682 --> 05:17.150
NOMINATION.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.885
AND WHILE MANY COMMENTATORS

05:18.885 --> 05:20.753
INSIST ON FRAMING HIM SOLELY IN

05:20.753 --> 05:22.188
OPPOSITION TO TRUMP-- SAYING

05:22.188 --> 05:23.322
THINGS LIKE THAT HE'S "DONALD

05:23.322 --> 05:25.124
TRUMP WITH A BRAIN"-- THAT

05:25.124 --> 05:25.892
THAT DOESN'T SEEM PARTICULARLY

05:25.892 --> 05:27.627
MEANINGFUL.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.695
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "THAT NEW

05:28.695 --> 05:29.729
RESTAURANT IS BETTER THAN THIS

05:29.729 --> 05:30.830
CHICKEN POT PIE THAT FELL ON THE

05:30.830 --> 05:32.131
SIDEWALK."

05:32.131 --> 05:33.466
SURE, IT IS BUT YOU'RE NOT

05:33.466 --> 05:34.801
GIVING ME MUCH USEFUL

05:34.801 --> 05:36.235
INFORMATION THERE.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.537
SO IF I MAY QUOTE TOM BRADY'S

05:37.537 --> 05:40.173
PUBLICIST WHILE REVIEWING HIS

05:40.173 --> 05:41.708
"LET'S TAKE

05:41.708 --> 05:44.510
TRUMP OUT OF THE PICTURE."

05:44.510 --> 05:46.479
AND TONIGHT, LET'S EXAMINE

05:46.479 --> 05:48.081
DESANTIS ON HIS OWN MERITS, AND

05:48.081 --> 05:50.917
LOOK AT JUST SOME OF WHAT HE'S

05:50.917 --> 05:51.918
DONE TO AND FOR THE OVER 20

05:51.918 --> 05:52.919
MILLION PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.220
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETIMES LESS AND

05:54.220 --> 05:55.254
HE CLAIMED, SOMETIMES LESS THAN

05:55.254 --> 05:57.256
HIS CRITICS CLAIM AND SOMETIMES

05:57.256 --> 05:58.524
WORSE THAN

05:58.524 --> 05:59.459
YOU MAY KNOW.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.359
AND LET'S SKIP OVER HIS EARLY

06:00.359 --> 06:01.260
LIFE-- THE SHORT VERSION BEING,

06:01.260 --> 06:02.395
HE GREW UP IN FLORIDA, WAS A

06:02.395 --> 06:03.629
STANDOUT BASEBALL PLAYER, AND

06:03.629 --> 06:04.597
EVEN GOT TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE

06:04.597 --> 06:05.932
WORLD SERIES WITH HIS LOCAL

06:05.932 --> 06:07.333
TEAM.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.601
HE THEN WENT TO YALE, THEN

06:08.601 --> 06:10.269
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL AND

06:10.269 --> 06:10.903
SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED THE NAVY AS

06:10.903 --> 06:12.371
AN ATTORNEY.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.639
EVENTUALLY HE MARRIED HIS WIFE

06:13.639 --> 06:15.074
CASEY DESPITE HAVING THE MOST

06:15.074 --> 06:16.342
BIZARRE DATING TACTIC I HAVE

06:16.342 --> 06:18.411
EVER HEARD.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.645
ACCORDING TO A FORMER CLASSMATE

06:19.645 --> 06:22.115
HE WOULD APPARENTLY TELL DATES

06:22.115 --> 06:27.019
HE LIKES THAI FOOD BUT

06:27.019 --> 06:28.721
PRONOUNCED IT THIGH.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.789
IF THEY CORRECTED HIM, HE WOULD

06:29.789 --> 06:30.356
MAKE UP AN EXCUSE TO LEAVE,

06:30.356 --> 06:31.290
BECAUSE QUOTE "HE DIDN'T WANT A

06:31.290 --> 06:32.892
GIRLFRIEND WHO CORRECTED HIM."

06:32.892 --> 06:34.393
AND IF THAT'S TRUE, WOW.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.629
JUST IMAGINE BEING ON THAT DATE.

06:36.629 --> 06:37.797
YOU'RE OUT AT DINNER, AND OUT OF

06:37.797 --> 06:39.198
NOWHERE, YOUR DATE TELLS YOU HE

06:39.198 --> 06:41.100
REALLY LIKES "THIGH" FOOD.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.201
YOU THINK, "WAIT, DID HE JUST

06:42.201 --> 06:43.269
CALL THAI FOOD "THIGH' FOOD?

06:43.269 --> 06:44.437
I MUST HAVE MISHEARD."

06:44.437 --> 06:45.671
BUT THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY HE

06:45.671 --> 06:51.244
KNOWS A GREAT FIVE FOOD

06:51.244 --> 06:53.846
KNOWS A GREAT THIGH FOOD

06:53.846 --> 06:54.747
RESTAURANT IN THE AREA

06:54.747 --> 06:55.348
WHILE STARING VERY INTENTLY AT

06:55.348 --> 06:55.882
YOU, ALMOST STUDYING YOUR

06:55.882 --> 06:56.582
REACTION.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.316
SO AS POLITELY AS YOU CAN, YOU

06:57.316 --> 06:58.484
SAY, "WAIT, DO YOU MEAN "THAI"

06:58.484 --> 06:59.218
FOOD?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.019
LIKE, FROM THAILAND?"

07:00.019 --> 07:00.887
AND THEN SUDDENLY, HIS FACE

07:00.887 --> 07:01.721
DROPS, AND HE SAYS 'SORRY, I

07:01.721 --> 07:02.555
FORGOT I HAVE A DOCTOR'S

07:02.555 --> 07:03.356
APPOINTMENT TONIGHT," AND HE

07:03.356 --> 07:04.056
LEAVES, LEAVING YOU WITH THE

07:04.056 --> 07:04.824
CHECK, AND THE GREATEST

07:04.824 --> 07:05.691
FIRST-DATE DISASTER STORY OF ALL

07:05.691 --> 07:09.896
TIME.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.000
THEN IN 2012 HE WAS ELECTED TO

07:14.000 --> 07:15.802
CONGRESS.

07:15.802 --> 07:16.569
WHILE THERE, A FORMER COLLEAGUE

07:16.569 --> 07:17.436
SAYS HE ALWAYS HAD HIS EARBUDS

07:17.436 --> 07:19.438
IN, TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.274
AND IF YOU'RE PICKING UP ON A

07:21.274 --> 07:22.608
THEME OF "RON DESANTIS DOESN'T

07:22.608 --> 07:23.876
LIKE HEARING ANYONE'S VOICE BUT

07:23.876 --> 07:26.279
HIS OWN," YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.213
BECAUSE SINCE BECOMING FLORIDA

07:27.213 --> 07:28.414
GOVERNOR, HE'S MADE "SHUTTING

07:28.414 --> 07:29.816
DOWN DISSENTING VOICES"

07:29.816 --> 07:31.284
SOMETHING OF A FEATURE.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.385
HERE'S A CAMPAIGN AD FROM LAST

07:32.385 --> 07:33.820
YEAR IN WHICH HE SHOWS OFF HIS

07:33.820 --> 07:38.457
SKILL AT BATTLING THE MEDIA.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.892
GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND

07:39.892 --> 07:40.560
GENTLEMEN.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.761
THIS IS YOUR GOVERNOR SPEAKING.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.562
TODAY'S TRAINING EVOLUTION:

07:42.562 --> 07:43.763
DOGFIGHTING.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.464
TAKING ON THE CORPORATE MEDIA.

07:45.464 --> 07:49.001
DON'T FIRE UNLESS

07:49.001 --> 07:50.536
FIRED UPON, BUT WHEN THEY FIRE,

07:50.536 --> 07:52.605
YOU FIRE BACK WITH OVERWHELMING

07:52.605 --> 07:53.840
FORCE.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.373
DOES IT SAY THAT IN THE

07:54.373 --> 07:55.141
BILL?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.410
I'M ASKING YOU TO

07:57.410 --> 07:58.945
TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE BILL.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.847
NEVER, EVER BACK

08:00.847 --> 08:02.381
DOWN FROM A FIGHT.

08:02.381 --> 08:03.216
IF I COULD COMPLETE THE

08:03.216 --> 08:04.183
QUESTION, THOUGH, WOULD YOU

08:04.183 --> 08:04.650
RATHER IT BE-?

08:04.650 --> 08:05.151
SO ARE YOU GONNA GIVE A

08:05.151 --> 08:06.285
SPEECH OR ASK A QUESTION?

08:06.285 --> 08:07.353
DON'T ACCEPT

08:07.353 --> 08:08.254
THEIR NARRATIVE.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.856
IT'S WRONG, IT'S A FAKE

08:09.856 --> 08:11.123
NARRATIVE, I JUST DISABUSED YOU

08:11.123 --> 08:12.391
OF THE NARRATIVE, AND YOU DON'T

08:12.391 --> 08:15.094
CARE ABOUT THE FACTS.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.262
AMAZINGLY, UNTIL 40

08:16.262 --> 08:17.663
SECONDS AGO, "TOP GUN: MAVERICK"

08:17.663 --> 08:18.598
WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF LAST

08:18.598 --> 08:20.032
YEAR.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.934
NOW, I'M SAD TO SAY, IT'S MY

08:21.934 --> 08:22.635
LEAST FAVORITE MOVIE OF

08:22.635 --> 08:23.169
ALL TIME, TIED WITH

08:23.169 --> 08:23.736
"CATS"

08:23.736 --> 08:27.607
AND "THE ZAPRUDER FILM."

08:27.607 --> 08:28.941
DESANTIS IS CONSTANTLY

08:28.941 --> 08:32.778
COMPLAINING THE MEDIA'S TAKING

08:32.778 --> 08:33.713
HIM OUT OF CONTEXT.

08:33.713 --> 08:34.947
ALTHOUGH IT'S

08:34.947 --> 08:35.715
WORTH NOTING THAT IN THAT AD,

08:35.715 --> 08:36.382
HE'S REMOVING SOME PRETTY

08:36.382 --> 08:36.983
IMPORTANT CONTEXT FROM THE

08:36.983 --> 08:37.550
MEDIA.

08:37.550 --> 08:38.317
TAKE THAT CLIP WHERE HE SAID,

08:38.317 --> 08:39.552
"ARE YOU GONNA GIVE A SPEECH OR

08:39.552 --> 08:40.519
ASK A QUESTION?", IF YOU LOOK AT

08:40.519 --> 08:41.721
THE START OF THAT EXCHANGE,

08:41.721 --> 08:43.189
YOU'LL NOTICE ONLY ONE PERSON IS

08:43.189 --> 08:44.924
DOING THE FIGHTING THERE.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.092
GOVERNOR, WHAT HAS GONE WRONG

08:46.092 --> 08:46.759
WITH-GOVERNOR, WHAT HAS GONE

08:46.759 --> 08:48.761
WRONG WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THE

08:48.761 --> 08:49.962
VACCINE THAT WE'VE SEEN PHONE

08:49.962 --> 08:54.233
LINES JAMMED, WEBSITES CRASHING,

08:54.233 --> 08:54.734
IT'S A LOT OF DEMAND.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.534
I MEAN, I THINK AT THE END OF

08:55.534 --> 08:56.002
IF I COULD-

08:56.002 --> 08:56.602
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, YOU JUST

08:56.602 --> 08:57.136
SAID WHAT HAS GONE WRONG.

08:57.136 --> 08:57.737
SO I'M ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

08:57.737 --> 08:58.371
IF I COULD COMPLETE THE

08:58.371 --> 08:59.272
QUESTION THOUGH.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.006
SO ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE A

09:00.006 --> 09:00.539
SPEECH OR YOU'RE GOING TO

09:00.539 --> 09:02.108
ANSWER-ASK A QUESTION?

09:02.108 --> 09:02.842
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

09:02.842 --> 09:03.442
GOVERNOR, I'M TRYING TO-

09:03.442 --> 09:04.043
YOU

09:04.043 --> 09:04.443
ASKED A QUESTION.

09:04.443 --> 09:04.944
I'M GOING TO ANSWER IT.

09:04.944 --> 09:05.611
I'M TRYING TO FINISH MY

09:05.611 --> 09:06.379
QUESTION.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.346
NO, YOU ARE GIVING A SPEECH,

09:07.346 --> 09:08.581
YOU ASKED A QUESTION.

09:08.581 --> 09:13.786
I AM TRYING TO ASK YOU-

09:13.786 --> 09:14.420
YOU ARE GOING TO ASK HOW MANY

09:14.420 --> 09:14.687
QUESTIONS?

09:14.687 --> 09:15.154
YOU GET THREE?

09:15.154 --> 09:15.821
THEY ONLY GOT ONE QUESTION.

09:15.821 --> 09:16.289
WHY DO YOU GET THREE?

09:16.289 --> 09:16.789
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

09:16.789 --> 09:17.390
GOVERNOR, I'M JUST ASKING IF I

09:17.390 --> 09:17.924
COULD FINISH MY QUESTION.

09:17.924 --> 09:18.457
YOU DIDN'T.

09:18.457 --> 09:19.992
YOU FINISHED THE QUESTION.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.963
NO SHE DIDN'T!

09:23.963 --> 09:24.563
AND ALL SHE'S DOING IS ASKING

09:24.563 --> 09:25.598
FOR SOME BASIC ACCOUNTABILITY.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.066
WHEN YOU SEE THAT IN CONTEXT,

09:27.066 --> 09:27.967
THAT'S A PRETTY GROSS CASE OF

09:27.967 --> 09:29.368
SOMEONE MEATBALLSPLAINING TO A

09:29.368 --> 09:31.203
JOURNALIST WHO'S JUST TRYING TO

09:31.203 --> 09:33.439
DO HER FUCKING JOB.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.540
THOUGH, TO BE CLEAR, DESANTIS

09:34.540 --> 09:36.208
DOESN'T HATE ALL MEDIA.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.543
BECAUSE THERE IS ONE NOTABLE

09:37.543 --> 09:38.544
EXCEPTION, AND IT'S THE EXACT

09:38.544 --> 09:40.046
ONE YOU'RE THINKING OF.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.548
DESANTIS IS ON FOX NEWS ALL THE

09:42.548 --> 09:44.283
TIME-- MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.018
EVEN BY REPUBLICAN STANDARDS,

09:46.018 --> 09:47.186
THE MUTUAL AFFECTION BETWEEN HIM

09:47.186 --> 09:48.821
AND FOX IS PRETTY EXTREME.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.690
IN JUST ONE FOUR-MONTH STRETCH,

09:50.690 --> 09:52.291
THE NETWORK ASKED HIM TO APPEAR

09:52.291 --> 09:54.460
ON ITS AIRWAVES 113 TIMES, OR

09:54.460 --> 09:57.463
NEARLY ONCE A DAY, WITH ONE FOX

09:57.463 --> 09:58.664
PRODUCER EVEN OFFERING TO LET

09:58.664 --> 10:00.399
HIM PICK THE SUBJECT MATTER IF

10:00.399 --> 10:02.535
HE AGREED TO COME ON.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.836
WHICH IS PATHETIC.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.404
I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY.

10:05.404 --> 10:06.572
IF FOX NEWS EVER WENT ON A DATE

10:06.572 --> 10:07.907
WITH RON DESANTIS, THEY

10:07.907 --> 10:09.442
DEFINITELY WOULDN'T CORRECT HIM

10:09.442 --> 10:15.281
WHEN HE CALLED IT "FIRE" FOOD.

10:15.281 --> 10:15.815
HE ISN'T JUST ANOTHER FOX

10:15.815 --> 10:16.182
TALKING HEAD.

10:16.182 --> 10:16.615
HE

10:16.615 --> 10:17.316
SELLS HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WITH A

10:17.316 --> 10:19.185
PROVEN TRACK RECORD.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.287
AND HE HAS DONE SOME TERRIBLE

10:21.287 --> 10:22.688
STUFF-- FOR INSTANCE, AT HIS

10:22.688 --> 10:24.190
URGING, HIS STATE'S MEDICAL

10:24.190 --> 10:25.124
BOARD BAND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE

10:25.124 --> 10:26.292
FOR MINORS AND HE SIGNED A 15

10:26.292 --> 10:29.328
WEEK ABORTION BAN INTO LAW WHILE

10:29.328 --> 10:30.262
RECENTLY SUGGESTING HE'D SIGN A

10:30.262 --> 10:32.031
SIX-WEEK ONE IF IT REACHED HIS

10:32.031 --> 10:33.799
DESK.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.001
LOTS OF REPUBLICAN

10:35.001 --> 10:37.603
GOVERNORS HAVE DONE THAT.

10:37.603 --> 10:38.904
WHAT MAKES DESANTIS EXTRA

10:38.904 --> 10:40.239
POPULAR ON THE RIGHT IS HIS

10:40.239 --> 10:41.340
WILLINGNESS TO WAGE BIG,

10:41.340 --> 10:42.975
SYMBOLIC CULTURE WARS.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.076
HE'S BRAGGED THAT HE'S MADE

10:44.076 --> 10:46.045
FLORIDA "THE FREEST STATE" IN

10:46.045 --> 10:47.346
AMERICA

10:47.346 --> 10:48.214
WHILE DEFENDING ITS RESIDENTS

10:48.214 --> 10:49.382
FROM THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF OUR

10:49.382 --> 10:51.450
TIME.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.485
WOKEISM IS REALLY A FORM OF

10:52.485 --> 10:55.788
CULTURAL MARXISM.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.489
IS THE NEW RELIGION OF THE

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
LEFT.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.493
WE ARE NOT, AND WILL NEVER, EVER

11:00.493 --> 11:03.496
SURRENDER TO THE WOKE MOB.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.631
FLORIDA IS WHERE WOKE GOES TO

11:05.631 --> 11:07.700
DIE.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.968
OKAY, FIRST: FLORIDA IS

11:08.968 --> 11:10.002
NOT WHERE WOKE GOES TO DIE.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.003
IT'S

11:11.003 --> 11:12.204
WHERE WEALTHY UPPER EAST SIDE

11:12.204 --> 11:12.938
NEW YORKERS GO TO DIE.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.007
GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.742
DESANTIS SAYS "WOKE"

11:16.742 --> 11:18.444
SO OFTEN IT BEGINS TO LOSE ALL

11:18.444 --> 11:19.879
MEANING, BUT IF YOU'RE WONDERING

11:19.879 --> 11:22.448
WHAT HE THINKS IT ACTUALLY

11:22.448 --> 11:23.249
STANDS FOR, HIS GENERAL COUNSEL

11:23.249 --> 11:28.454
ONCE HELPFULLY DEFINED "WOKE" IN

11:28.454 --> 11:29.121
COURT AS, "THE VIEW THAT THERE

11:29.121 --> 11:29.789
ARE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES IN

11:29.789 --> 11:30.623
AMERICAN SOCIETY AND THE NEED TO

11:30.623 --> 11:31.390
HAVE POLICIES THAT ADDRESS

11:31.390 --> 11:33.092
THEM."

11:33.092 --> 11:34.460
WHICH IS A HELL OF A THING FOR

11:34.460 --> 11:36.395
SOMEONE TO ADMIT TO EVERYONE

11:36.395 --> 11:37.763
THAT YOU'RE AGAINST.

11:37.763 --> 11:38.597
DESANTIS MIGHT REALLY WANT TO

11:38.597 --> 11:39.698
INVEST IN A LAWYER MORE WILLING

11:39.698 --> 11:41.267
TO LIE FOR HIM.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.002
I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND

11:43.002 --> 11:43.769
THERE'S ONE WANDERING AROUND

11:43.769 --> 11:44.804
CENTRAL PARK RIGHT NOW WHO'S

11:44.804 --> 11:47.873
AVAILABLE, IF YOU CAN CATCH HIM.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.443
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.410
HE'S SLIPPY!

11:51.410 --> 11:52.244
DESANTIS EXPENDS A LOT OF ENERGY

11:52.244 --> 11:53.079
DECRYING WOKENESS AND EMPTY

11:53.079 --> 11:55.514
"VIRTUE SIGNALING"-- ALTHOUGH

11:55.514 --> 11:56.749
HE ALSO SEEMS TO SPEND A HUGE

11:56.749 --> 11:57.516
AMOUNT OF TIME DOING THE

11:57.516 --> 11:58.417
RIGHT-WING VERSION OF EXACTLY

11:58.417 --> 11:59.785
THAT.

11:59.785 --> 12:08.561
FOR INSTANCE, THERE WAS THE TIME

12:08.561 --> 12:08.994
THAT HE WADED IN ON

12:08.994 --> 12:09.628
LIA THOMAS, A TRANS WOMAN WHO'D

12:09.628 --> 12:10.262
WON AN EVENT IN AN NCAA SWIMMING

12:10.262 --> 12:10.930
CHAMPIONSHIP.

12:10.930 --> 12:11.730
THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER HAPPEN

12:11.730 --> 12:12.731
TO BE FROM FLORIDA

12:12.731 --> 12:13.632
WHICH DESANTIS THEN TOOK AS AN

12:13.632 --> 12:14.233
EXCUSE TO COME OUT AND DO THIS

12:14.867 --> 12:16.168
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE NCAA

12:16.168 --> 12:18.571
HAS DONE BY ALLOWING BASICALLY

12:18.571 --> 12:20.906
MEN TO COMPETE IN WOMEN'S

12:20.906 --> 12:22.508
ATHLETICS, IN THIS CASE THE

12:22.508 --> 12:26.045
SWIMMING, YOU HAD THE NUMBER ONE

12:26.045 --> 12:26.645
WOMAN WHO FINISHED WAS FROM

12:26.645 --> 12:27.546
SARASOTA.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.216
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A

12:30.216 --> 12:32.485
PROCLAMATION SAYING THAT EMMA IS

12:32.485 --> 12:34.320
THE BEST FEMALE SWIMMER IN THE

12:34.320 --> 12:36.122
500 METER FREESTYLE BECAUSE SHE

12:36.122 --> 12:38.457
EARNED THAT.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.059
OKAY, ASIDE FROM BEING

12:40.059 --> 12:41.293
FUCKING GROSS AND AWFUL, TO BE

12:41.293 --> 12:42.261
DESANTIS DOESN'T

12:42.261 --> 12:44.230
HAVE THE POWER TO DECLARE OR

12:44.230 --> 12:45.297
DISQUALIFY WINNERS IN COLLEGE

12:45.297 --> 12:46.699
SPORTS, RENDERING THAT

12:46.699 --> 12:48.067
PROCLAMATION COMPLETELY

12:48.067 --> 12:49.535
POINTLESS.

12:49.535 --> 12:50.769
BUT SINCE MEN IN SUITS SEEM TO

12:50.769 --> 12:52.104
BE USING THEIR PLATFORMS TO

12:52.104 --> 12:53.772
INVALIDATE PAST ATHLETIC

12:53.772 --> 12:55.174
ACHIEVEMENTS OUT OF PURE SPITE,

12:55.174 --> 12:57.409
I HEREBY DECLARE THAT BY SIGNING

12:57.409 --> 13:00.412
THIS, RON DESANTIS' LITTLE

13:00.412 --> 13:01.013
LEAGUE

13:01.013 --> 13:01.614
TEAM-- THE SWINGIN' MEATBALLS

13:01.614 --> 13:03.482
DID NOT, IN FACT, EVER MAKE

13:03.482 --> 13:04.850
THE LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.918
INSTEAD, HIS TEAM'S PLACE WILL

13:05.918 --> 13:06.986
FROM HENCEFORTH BE TAKEN BY THE

13:06.986 --> 13:08.020
SEASON SIX CAST

13:08.020 --> 13:11.991
RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE.

13:11.991 --> 13:15.961
I DECLARE IT!

13:15.961 --> 13:16.328
IT IS DECLARED.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.596
IT IS DONE.

13:17.596 --> 13:18.164
BUT IT'S GONE WAY

13:18.164 --> 13:19.265
BEYOND JUST EMPTY, HATEFUL

13:19.265 --> 13:20.166
PROCLAMATIONS.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.167
DESANTIS HAS ALSO SIGNED A BUNCH

13:21.167 --> 13:22.134
OF ATTENTION-GRABBING BILLS THAT

13:22.134 --> 13:23.068
SEEM DESIGNED TO DELIGHT

13:23.068 --> 13:23.869
CONSERVATIVES AND ENRAGE

13:23.869 --> 13:25.204
LIBERALS.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.572
AND WHILE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF

13:26.572 --> 13:28.174
THESE BILLS TEND TO GET A LOT OF

13:28.174 --> 13:30.009
NATIONAL MEDIA COVERAGE, THE

13:30.009 --> 13:31.510
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THEM

13:31.510 --> 13:33.612
CAN GET FAR LESS SCRUTINY.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.813
TAKE DESANTIS' SO-CALLED

13:34.813 --> 13:36.148
"ANTI-RIOT LAW", WHICH HE PASSED

13:36.148 --> 13:37.449
FOLLOWING THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

13:37.449 --> 13:39.885
PROTESTS IN THE SUMMER OF 2020.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.153
THE LAW, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

13:41.153 --> 13:43.355
STRENGTHENS CRIMINAL PENALTIES

13:43.355 --> 13:44.456
FOR THOSE DEEMED RIOTERS AT

13:44.456 --> 13:45.457
DEMONSTRATIONS.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.625
AND HE LOVES TO

13:46.625 --> 13:48.827
BRAG TO CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCES

13:48.827 --> 13:50.529
ABOUT HOW MAD IT'S MADE PEOPLE.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.864
AND I HAVE TO SAY-BRAG A

13:51.864 --> 13:53.666
LITTLE BIT.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.434
OUR ANTI RIOT LEGISLATION WAS

13:55.434 --> 13:56.535
RECENTLY CRITICIZED BY THE

13:56.535 --> 13:58.270
UNITED NATIONS.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.104
SO I WEAR THAT AS A BADGE OF

13:59.104 --> 14:01.207
HONOR.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.342
OKAY!

14:03.342 --> 14:04.410
BUT BEING CHASTISED BY THE UN

14:04.410 --> 14:06.712
ISN'T INNATELY POSITIVE.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.713
WHAT OTHER ADMONITIONS WOULD

14:07.713 --> 14:09.081
FILL DESANTIS WITH A MISPLACED

14:09.081 --> 14:10.382
SENSE OF PRIDE?

14:10.382 --> 14:13.052
"I WAS ALSO CRITICIZED BY THE

14:13.052 --> 14:14.186
HOLOCAUST MUSEUM, LEGO CALLED ME

14:14.186 --> 14:15.487
A SCUMBAG, AND MALALA YOUSAFZAI

14:15.487 --> 14:16.488
SAID SHE'D PUNCH ME IN THE

14:16.488 --> 14:17.723
OF THROAT IF SHE EVER GOT A

14:17.723 --> 14:18.958
CHANCE SO I WEAR THAT AS A BADGE

14:18.958 --> 14:22.828
OF HONOR.

14:22.828 --> 14:23.796
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE UN THAT

14:23.796 --> 14:25.364
HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT LAW.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.732
A JUDGE ISSUED A PRELIMINARY

14:26.732 --> 14:27.800
INJUNCTION BLOCKING THE KEY PART

14:27.800 --> 14:28.767
OF IT FROM BEING ENFORCED,

14:28.767 --> 14:29.902
ARGUING THAT IT COULD

14:29.902 --> 14:34.907
EFFECTIVELY CRIMINALIZE LEGAL,

14:34.907 --> 14:35.507
PROTECTED SPEECH, AND THAT IT

14:35.507 --> 14:36.041
WAS VACANT TO THE POINT OF

14:36.041 --> 14:37.343
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY.

14:37.343 --> 14:38.711
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIS

14:38.711 --> 14:39.979
"STOP SOCIAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP

14:39.979 --> 14:41.180
ACT", WHICH, AGAIN, GOT A HUGE

14:41.180 --> 14:42.348
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION WHEN HE

14:42.348 --> 14:43.782
FIRST SIGNED IT.

14:43.782 --> 14:44.984
IT THREATENED SOCIAL MEDIA

14:44.984 --> 14:46.018
PLATFORMS WITH FINES FOR BANNING

14:46.018 --> 14:47.519
POLITICAL CANDIDATES, AND HE

14:47.519 --> 14:49.822
PROPOSED IT RIGHT AFTER A NUMBER

14:49.822 --> 14:51.757
OF THEM REMOVED TRUMP AFTER

14:51.757 --> 14:53.225
JANUARY 6TH.

14:53.225 --> 14:53.626
'CAUSE OF.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.426
Y'KNOW.

14:54.426 --> 14:57.596
THAT THING.

14:57.596 --> 14:58.330
BUT THAT LAW IS ALSO

14:58.330 --> 14:59.031
UNDER A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION,

14:59.031 --> 15:00.099
FROM A JUDGE WHO AT ONE POINT

15:00.099 --> 15:02.167
TOLD THE DESANTIS

15:02.167 --> 15:03.502
ADMINISTRATION'S LAWYERS, "I

15:03.502 --> 15:04.436
WON'T PUT YOU ON THE SPOT AND

15:04.436 --> 15:05.804
ASK YOU IF YOU'VE EVER DEALT

15:05.804 --> 15:08.007
WITH A STATUTE THAT WAS MORE

15:08.007 --> 15:09.308
POORLY DRAFTED, AND LOOK: HE'S

15:09.308 --> 15:11.043
STILL FIGHTING THOSE LAWSUITS,

15:11.043 --> 15:12.344
AND FUTURE DECISIONS COULD WIND

15:12.344 --> 15:13.245
UP GOING HIS WAY-- AFTER ALL,

15:13.245 --> 15:14.179
THESE CASES ARE GOING THROUGH

15:14.179 --> 15:15.648
HIGHER COURTS THAT RANGE FROM

15:15.648 --> 15:20.819
FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE ALL THE WAY

15:20.819 --> 15:21.720
UP TO OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.955
EVEN WHEN HE HAS EXISTING LAWS

15:22.955 --> 15:24.590
ON HIS SIDE, HIS APPLICATION OF

15:24.590 --> 15:26.292
THEM CAN BE SLAPDASH AND GROSS.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.993
LAST YEAR, HE MADE A BIG SHOW OF

15:27.993 --> 15:29.595
ANNOUNCING HIS NEW "ELECTIONS

15:29.595 --> 15:32.965
CRIME AND SECURITY OFFICE" HAD

15:32.965 --> 15:33.799
SPEARHEADED THE ARRESTS OF 20

15:33.799 --> 15:34.833
PEOPLE WHO'D VOTED ILLEGALLY.

15:34.833 --> 15:35.968
BUT THESE WERE LARGELY PEOPLE

15:35.968 --> 15:37.636
WHO THE STATE HAD CLEARED TO

15:37.636 --> 15:39.605
JOIN THE VOTER ROLLS, SO THEY

15:39.605 --> 15:40.539
ASSUMED THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO

15:40.539 --> 15:41.874
VOTE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY

15:41.874 --> 15:43.909
TECHNICALLY WEREN'T.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.411
ONE WAY

15:45.411 --> 15:46.178
OF DEALING WITH THAT WOULD'VE

15:46.178 --> 15:47.112
BEEN TO SIMPLY CONTACT THOSE

15:47.112 --> 15:48.714
PEOPLE, EXPLAIN THE MISTAKE, AND

15:48.714 --> 15:50.282
REMOVE THEM FROM THE ROLLS.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.185
BUT INSTEAD, WHAT DESANTIS DID

15:53.185 --> 15:54.920
WAS TO SEND ARMED COPS TO

15:54.920 --> 15:55.921
CONDUCT ARRESTS WITH BODY CAM

15:55.921 --> 16:05.064
VIDEO REVEALING POLICE WITH GUNS

16:05.064 --> 16:05.631
DRAWN PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF

16:05.631 --> 16:06.065
THEIR

16:06.065 --> 16:06.765
HOUSES AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE

16:06.765 --> 16:07.533
COPS INVOLVED, EVEN THEY SEEM

16:07.533 --> 16:08.167
ANNOYED AND EMBARRASSED AT WHAT

16:08.167 --> 16:08.701
THEY'RE HAVING TO DO.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.368
THEY JUST DUMPED THIS

16:09.368 --> 16:10.703
SHIT ON ME.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.804
I HAD TO PLAN THREE OPERATIONS

16:11.804 --> 16:13.405
IN FOUR HOURS.

16:13.405 --> 16:13.939
I AIN'T FRAUD-COMMIT NO

16:13.939 --> 16:15.074
FRAUD.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.709
WELL, SO THAT'S THE THING.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.243
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

16:18.243 --> 16:19.078
HAPPENED WITH IT, BUT YOU-YOU DO

16:19.078 --> 16:19.812
HAVE A WARRANT, AND THAT'S WHAT

16:19.812 --> 16:21.447
IT'S FOR.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.681
WHY ARE Y'ALL DOING THIS NOW,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.550
AND THIS HAPPENED YEARS AGO?

16:24.550 --> 16:25.184
I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE NO IDEA,

16:25.184 --> 16:26.318
MAN.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.419
WOW.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.756
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SKETCHY

16:30.756 --> 16:31.523
YOUR AUDIO NEEDS TO BE FOR COPS

16:31.523 --> 16:33.926
TO ENFORCE IT RELUCTANTLY?

16:33.926 --> 16:34.827
ENFORCING LAWS ON SCARED PEOPLE

16:34.827 --> 16:35.728
IS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE THINGS

16:35.728 --> 16:37.262
TO DO.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.197
IT'S THAT, "MAKE SIREN GO WEE

16:38.197 --> 16:39.932
WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO" AND END OF

16:39.932 --> 16:44.470
LIST.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.037
NOW, SINCE THEN, SEVERAL OF

16:45.037 --> 16:46.405
THOSE CASES, INCLUDING ALL THOSE

16:46.405 --> 16:47.206
WE JUST SHOWED, HAVE BEEN

16:47.206 --> 16:48.440
DROPPED OR DISMISSED.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.008
BUT IT

16:50.008 --> 16:51.243
FEELS LIKE DESANTIS' MAIN AIM

16:51.243 --> 16:52.544
THERE-- AS IN SO MANY CASES--

16:52.544 --> 16:54.813
WAS TO INSTILL FEAR.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.582
TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID TO

16:56.582 --> 16:58.083
PROTEST, OR TO MODERATE CONTENT,

16:58.083 --> 16:59.451
OR EVEN TO VOTE.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.153
AND THAT'S THE

17:01.153 --> 17:02.154
THING-- EVEN HIS SLOPPILY

17:02.154 --> 17:03.622
WRITTEN LAWS CAN END UP DOING

17:03.622 --> 17:04.623
REAL HARM.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.358
AND MAYBE THE CLEAREST PLACE TO

17:06.358 --> 17:07.126
SEE ALL OF THIS IN ACTION IS IN

17:07.126 --> 17:09.061
FLORIDA'S SCHOOLS.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.763
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN BUSY THERE.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.331
YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER LAST

17:12.331 --> 17:14.032
YEAR'S PASSAGE OF H-B 1557,

17:14.032 --> 17:16.969
THE FLORIDA PARENTAL RIGHTS IN

17:16.969 --> 17:17.736
EDUCATION ACT, A-K-A "THE DON'T

17:17.736 --> 17:19.538
SAY GAY BILL."

17:19.538 --> 17:20.639
THOUGH DESANTIS SAYS THAT NAME

17:20.639 --> 17:22.508
PUSHES A FALSE NARRATIVE, AND

17:22.508 --> 17:24.443
HAS CLAIMED THAT WHAT THE BILL

17:24.443 --> 17:27.012
SIMPLY SAYS IS NO SEXUAL

17:27.012 --> 17:27.579
INSTRUCTION IN PRE-K THROUGH

17:27.579 --> 17:28.781
THREE.

17:28.781 --> 17:36.722
BUT THE

17:36.722 --> 17:38.490
TRUTH IS, THE BILL IS NOT AS

17:38.490 --> 17:40.192
NARROW AS THAT AT ALL.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.059
AS THIS DESANTIS

17:41.059 --> 17:41.660
SUPPORTER OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGES.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.261
WHAT THIS BILL'S TRYING TO

17:42.261 --> 17:42.895
PREVENT IS INDOCTRINATION OF OUR

17:42.895 --> 17:43.162
CHILDREN.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.163
BUT THE BILL IS A SWEEPING,

17:44.163 --> 17:44.730
GENERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION

17:44.730 --> 17:45.364
THAT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO YOUNG

17:45.364 --> 17:46.265
CHILDREN, IT APPLIES THROUGHOUT

17:46.265 --> 17:47.232
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL AGE, WHERE IT

17:47.232 --> 17:48.333
SAYS "AGE-APPROPRIATE TEACHING

17:48.333 --> 17:49.067
OF GENDER IDENTITY AND

17:49.067 --> 17:50.469
SEXUALITY.'"

17:50.469 --> 17:51.270
SO THE BILL IS,

17:51.270 --> 17:52.538
IT-IT DOES, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT

17:52.538 --> 17:54.072
TARGETS KINDERGARTEN TO THIRD

17:54.072 --> 17:55.073
GRADE AND IT SAYS "OR AGE

17:55.073 --> 17:56.375
APPROPRIATE.'

17:56.375 --> 17:57.509
YEAH.

17:57.509 --> 17:58.710
SO WHEN IS IT AGE APPROPRIATE TO

17:58.710 --> 18:00.045
TALK ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY?

18:00.045 --> 18:01.580
IT-IT VARIES BY THE-BY THE

18:01.580 --> 18:03.048
INDIVIDUAL.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.283
YOU WOULD-YOU WOULD SUE A

18:04.283 --> 18:05.150
TEACHER IF THEY STARTED TALKING

18:05.150 --> 18:06.118
TO YOUR DAUGHTER ABOUT SAME-SEX

18:06.118 --> 18:07.486
MARRIAGE OR LGBT ISSUES AT THE

18:07.486 --> 18:08.854
AGE OF 17?

18:08.854 --> 18:10.122
IF THEY DON'T HAVE MY CONSENT

18:10.122 --> 18:11.523
AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S NOT

18:11.523 --> 18:12.090
APPROPRIATE FOR MY DAUGHTER,

18:12.090 --> 18:13.258
YES.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.626
WOW.

18:14.626 --> 18:15.260
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE

18:15.260 --> 18:19.598
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT.

18:19.598 --> 18:23.035
THAT IS THE LAW

18:23.035 --> 18:25.137
EXACTLY.

18:25.137 --> 18:30.008
THAT'S ROUGH TO HEAR, BUT HE IS

18:30.008 --> 18:32.878
TECHNICALLY RIGHT THERE.

18:32.878 --> 18:33.378
THANKS TO RON DESANTIS,

18:33.378 --> 18:34.012
RIGHT NOW IT IS THE LAW IN

18:34.012 --> 18:34.580
FLORIDA.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.214
IT'S FUNNY

18:35.214 --> 18:35.881
HOW IT'S ALWAYS THE PEOPLE WHO

18:35.881 --> 18:36.548
THINK HOMOSEXUALITY AS A CONCEPT

18:36.548 --> 18:37.382
NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT AT AN

18:37.382 --> 18:38.150
"APPROPRIATE AGE" THAT DON'T

18:38.150 --> 18:38.984
GIVE A SECOND THOUGHT TO WHEN

18:38.984 --> 18:39.818
THEY TEACH THEIR KIDS WHAT

18:39.818 --> 18:40.586
HETEROSEXUALITY IS.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.253
ALTHOUGH I COULD BE WRONG.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.187
MAY BE IN THAT GUY'S FAMILY HIS

18:42.187 --> 18:43.222
KID ASKS EVERY DAY "WHO ARE YOU

18:43.222 --> 18:47.259
PEOPLE LIVING IN MY HOUSE?"

18:47.259 --> 18:52.698
IS DAD, THAT LADY IS MOM AND WE

18:52.698 --> 18:53.332
ARE.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.433
FRIENDS.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.067
DON'T ASK ME ANY MORE QUESTIONS

18:55.067 --> 18:55.667
TILL YOU'RE 18 OR I'LL FUCKING

18:55.667 --> 18:56.068
SUE YOU.

18:56.068 --> 18:56.535
IT'S NOT JUST

18:56.535 --> 18:57.169
SEXUALITY IN DESANTIS'

18:57.169 --> 18:57.803
CROSSHAIRS-- HE'S ALSO PASSED

18:57.803 --> 18:58.937
AN ACT CALLED THE "STOP WOKE

18:58.937 --> 19:00.272
ACT", WHICH LIMITS THE WAYS

19:00.272 --> 19:01.440
CONCEPTS RELATED TO SYSTEMIC

19:01.440 --> 19:02.875
RACISM AND SEX DISCRIMINATION

19:02.875 --> 19:04.343
CAN BE DISCUSSED IN SCHOOLS AND

19:04.343 --> 19:06.345
TO HEAR HIM TELL IT, LAWS LIKE

19:06.345 --> 19:09.147
THAT ARE NEEDED, BECAUSE THE

19:09.147 --> 19:10.616
WOKENESS IN SCHOOLS GOES DEEPER

19:10.616 --> 19:12.384
THAN ANYONE MIGHT THINK.

19:12.384 --> 19:13.785
I WILL HAVE MATH BOOKS SENT

19:13.785 --> 19:15.854
TO MY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

19:15.854 --> 19:17.990
FOR REVIEW, THESE TEXTBOOKS, AND

19:17.990 --> 19:19.157
THEY WILL DO THINGS LIKE WOKE

19:19.157 --> 19:20.392
MATH.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.661
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, TWO

19:22.661 --> 19:24.630
PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.064
IT'S NOT, "TWO PLUS TWO.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.266
WELL, LET'S HAVE A STRUGGLE

19:27.266 --> 19:28.333
SESSION OVER THAT.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.801
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?" NO,

19:29.801 --> 19:30.536
NO, NO.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.538
THERE'S A RIGHT ANSWER HERE.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.572
I MEAN, OUT OF CONTEXT

19:33.572 --> 19:35.641
HE'S RIGHT.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.009
NUMBERS DON'T HAVE FEELINGS.

19:37.009 --> 19:37.943
IF THEY DID, THIS ONE WOULD BE

19:37.943 --> 19:39.945
SAD, THIS ONE WOULD BE GIGGLY,

19:39.945 --> 19:41.046
AND THIS ONE WOULD BE EXCITING

19:41.046 --> 19:41.914
FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT THEN THE

19:41.914 --> 19:42.748
NOVELTY WEARS OFF AND IT MOSTLY

19:42.748 --> 19:45.017
JUST GETS TIRED AND SORE.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.452
DESANTIS HAS CLAIMED THAT HIS

19:47.452 --> 19:48.620
STATE HAD TO REJECT MATH BOOKS

19:48.620 --> 19:49.955
FOR CONTAINING "INDOCTRINATING

19:49.955 --> 19:50.689
CONCEPTS LIKE RACE ESSENTIALISM,

19:50.689 --> 19:51.924
ESPECIALLY, BIZARRELY, FOR

19:51.924 --> 19:56.428
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS."

19:56.428 --> 19:57.162
NOW, THAT'S A BIG CLAIM.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.196
AND IF IT SOUNDS LIKE BULLSHIT,

19:58.196 --> 20:01.600
THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.334
REPORTERS FOR THESE OUTLETS

20:02.334 --> 20:03.368
COMBED THROUGH THOUSANDS OF

20:03.368 --> 20:04.369
PAGES OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

20:04.369 --> 20:05.237
TEXTBOOKS AND THEIR REVIEWS, AND

20:05.237 --> 20:07.573
COULDN'T FIND ANY SUCH EXAMPLES.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.941
WHEN THE DESANTIS ADMINISTRATION

20:08.941 --> 20:10.576
EVENTUALLY PRODUCED JUST FOUR

20:10.576 --> 20:11.944
TINY SNIPPETS OF WHAT THEY

20:11.944 --> 20:13.512
CLAIMED WAS OBJECTIONABLE

20:13.512 --> 20:16.448
MATERIAL, FROM THE TWO THAT CAME

20:16.448 --> 20:17.883
FROM GRADE SCHOOL BOOKS, THERE'S

20:17.883 --> 20:19.484
NOTHING ABOUT RACE.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.886
ALTHOUGH ONE

20:20.886 --> 20:21.720
DOES SUGGEST STUDENTS "PRACTICE

20:21.720 --> 20:23.221
WITH EMPATHIZING WITH

20:23.221 --> 20:24.590
CLASSMATES" WHILE THEY FULFILL A

20:24.590 --> 20:25.857
LESSON OBJECTIVE OF "IDENTIFY

20:25.857 --> 20:26.625
NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 5 IN

20:26.625 --> 20:27.659
SEQUENCE."

20:27.659 --> 20:29.227
THAT'S IT.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.963
SO HIS BIG CLAIM OF "WOKE MATH"

20:30.963 --> 20:32.531
AND "RACE ESSENTIALISM" IN GRADE

20:32.531 --> 20:33.999
SCHOOLS IS BASICALLY "REGULAR

20:33.999 --> 20:35.567
MATH" AND "TRYING TO TEACH KIDS

20:35.567 --> 20:37.669
NOT TO BE DICKS TO EACH OTHER."

20:38.604 --> 20:39.805
A KIND OF MATH EDUCATION

20:39.805 --> 20:41.239
DESANTIS MIGHT'VE BENEFITED

20:41.239 --> 20:42.240
FROM, AS HIS SOLUTION TO

20:42.240 --> 20:42.941
FIGURING OUT THE DIFFERENCE

20:42.941 --> 20:44.209
BETWEEN ONE AND THREE QUESTIONS

20:44.209 --> 20:45.577
SEEMS TO BE, "YELL UNTIL THE

20:45.577 --> 20:49.014
OTHER PERSON STOPS TALKING, "AND

20:50.515 --> 20:52.084
THE MOST RECENT THING YOU MAY'VE

20:52.084 --> 20:53.118
HEARD ABOUT ARE BOOKS BEING

20:53.118 --> 20:54.686
PULLED FROM SHELVES IN FLORIDA

20:54.686 --> 20:56.688
SCHOOLS, WITH VIRAL IMAGES, LIKE

20:56.688 --> 21:03.528
THESE MAKING THE ROUNDS ONLINE.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.063
IN CLASSIC FASHION, HE HAS

21:05.063 --> 21:07.399
PUSHED BACK ON THOSE IMAGES HARD

21:07.399 --> 21:09.067
TO.

21:09.067 --> 21:11.269
THEY TRIED TO CREATE IN

21:11.269 --> 21:12.604
FLORIDA, NARRATIVE, A BOOK BAND

21:12.604 --> 21:14.573
HOAX-- IT'S A HOAX WHAT THEY

21:14.573 --> 21:14.840
ARE DOING.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.440
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT

21:15.440 --> 21:17.042
BECAUSE WE HAVE PARENTAL RIGHTS

21:17.042 --> 21:17.876
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE CURRICULUM

21:17.876 --> 21:19.311
TRANSPARENCY, IF YOU HAVE A BOOK

21:19.311 --> 21:21.780
THAT HAS HARDCORE PORNOGRAPHY

21:21.780 --> 21:22.514
AND IT'S IN THE LIBRARY THAT

21:22.514 --> 21:23.749
10-YEAR-OLDS CAN ACCESS, A

21:23.749 --> 21:25.150
PARENT OBJECTS TO THAT, THAT

21:25.150 --> 21:26.418
DOES NOT SATISFY FLORIDA

21:26.418 --> 21:27.719
STANDARDS, IT SHOULD NOT BE IN

21:27.719 --> 21:28.987
THE LIBRARY WITH THOSE YOUNG

21:28.987 --> 21:31.156
KIDS.

21:31.156 --> 21:32.958
AND I THINK 99% OF PARENTS AGREE

21:32.958 --> 21:35.661
WITH THAT.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.395
OKAY, FIRST, LET'S

21:36.395 --> 21:37.996
DEBUNK THE MOST EGREGIOUS CLAIM

21:37.996 --> 21:38.563
99% OF PARENTS DON'T

21:38.563 --> 21:41.233
AGREE ON ANYTHING.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.668
I'M SURE YOU CAN

21:42.668 --> 21:44.036
FIND AT LEAST 10% OF PARENTS WHO

21:44.036 --> 21:45.103
ARE AGAINST COVERING ELECTRICAL

21:45.103 --> 21:46.571
SOCKETS IN REACH OF TODDLERS.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.240
THEY'RE CALLED "ZAP MOMS" AND

21:48.240 --> 21:49.408
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT LETTING KIDS

21:49.408 --> 21:50.342
DISCOVER THEIR OWN LIMITS OF

21:50.342 --> 21:52.711
ELECTRICITY.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.912
BUT I'LL GIVE

21:53.912 --> 21:55.480
DESANTIS THIS-- THERE HAS BEEN

21:55.480 --> 21:56.048
SOME MISINFORMATION FLOATING

21:56.048 --> 21:57.716
AROUND ONLINE.

21:57.716 --> 21:58.850
THIS VIRAL LIST OF BOOKS THAT

21:58.850 --> 22:00.419
WERE SUPPOSEDLY BANNED STATEWIDE

22:00.419 --> 22:05.023
IN FLORIDA, CIRCULATED WIDELY.

22:05.023 --> 22:08.226
BUT IT'S NONSENSE.

22:08.226 --> 22:11.496
HAVING SAID THAT, THOSE IMAGES

22:11.496 --> 22:18.470
OF EMPTY SHELVES ARE VERY REAL

22:18.470 --> 22:19.171
AND ARE DIRECT RESULT OF HIS

22:19.171 --> 22:19.404
ACTIONS.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.005
BECAUSE HE SIGNED LEGISLATION

22:20.005 --> 22:20.572
MANDATING THAT ONLY APPROVED

22:20.572 --> 22:21.173
BOOKS COULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY

22:21.173 --> 22:21.807
SCHOOL OR CLASSROOM LIBRARY, AND

22:21.807 --> 22:23.108
THAT APPROVAL MUST COME FROM A

22:23.108 --> 22:23.675
CERTIFIED MEDIA SPECIALIST.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.209
THAT LED SOME DISTRICTS--

22:24.209 --> 22:24.843
INCLUDING THE ONES THOSE PHOTOS

22:24.843 --> 22:26.311
ARE FROM-- TO TELL TEACHERS TO

22:26.311 --> 22:26.778
REMOVE OR COVER BOOKS.

22:26.778 --> 22:27.679
NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE PUSHING A

22:27.679 --> 22:28.747
FALSE NARRATIVE, BUT BECAUSE

22:28.747 --> 22:29.648
THEY WERE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH

22:29.648 --> 22:37.789
DESANTIS' STUPID LAW.

22:37.789 --> 22:38.290
AND WHILE

22:38.290 --> 22:38.924
DESANTIS MIGHT SAY, "THIS IS AN

22:38.924 --> 22:39.825
OVERREACTION, BECAUSE THOSE

22:39.825 --> 22:40.692
BOOKS WILL RETURN ONCE THEY'RE

22:40.692 --> 22:41.293
APPROVED," NOT ALL OF THEM.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.127
BECAUSE THANKS TO HIS NEW LAW,

22:42.127 --> 22:42.928
AS WELL AS THAT DON'T SAY GAY

22:42.928 --> 22:44.196
BILL AND HIS STOP WOKE ACT,

22:44.196 --> 22:44.863
HE'S

22:44.863 --> 22:45.697
TURBOCHARGED A MOVEMENT AMONG

22:45.697 --> 22:46.598
CONSERVATIVES TO GET BOOKS

22:46.598 --> 22:48.066
REMOVED FROM LIBRARIES THAT THEY

22:48.066 --> 22:49.868
JUST DON'T LIKE.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.369
AND THIS GOES

22:51.369 --> 22:53.405
BEYOND REMOVING "HARDCORE

22:53.405 --> 22:54.740
PORNOGRAPHY" OR THE USUAL KIND

22:54.740 --> 22:56.942
OF GIVE-AND-TAKE BETWEEN PARENTS

22:56.942 --> 22:59.745
AND SCHOOL BOARDS THAT'S BEEN

22:59.745 --> 23:00.679
GOING ON FOR DECADES NOW.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.013
WHAT DESANTIS HAS DONE IS MAKE

23:02.013 --> 23:03.515
IT SO ANYONE IN A COMMUNITY CAN

23:03.515 --> 23:04.683
CHALLENGE THESE BOOKS.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.184
REPORTERS TRACKED DOWN ONE WOMAN

23:06.184 --> 23:07.352
WHO SUBMITTED 21 BOOK CHALLENGES

23:07.352 --> 23:10.255
IN ONE COUNTY, ONLY TO FIND THAT

23:10.255 --> 23:11.990
SHE'S A RETIREE WITH NO

23:11.990 --> 23:13.125
CHILDREN, WHO FULLY ADMITS THAT

23:13.125 --> 23:14.292
SHE HASN'T READ ALL OF THEM, BUT

23:14.292 --> 23:18.196
"I'VE READ THEM IN PARTIAL."

23:18.196 --> 23:19.131
SO BASICALLY, SHE JUST SKIMMED

23:19.131 --> 23:19.765
THEM AND SAID "EH, NOBODY SHOULD

23:19.765 --> 23:21.967
READ THIS."

23:21.967 --> 23:23.135
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY,

23:23.135 --> 23:24.569
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT RON

23:24.569 --> 23:25.604
DESANTIS' BOOK, BUT I'M NOT

23:25.604 --> 23:26.605
TRYING TO GET IT TAKEN OUT OF

23:26.605 --> 23:29.808
LIBRARIES.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.143
MEANWHILE, THIS TEACHER IN

23:31.143 --> 23:32.611
ESCAMBIA COUNTY, FLORIDA,

23:32.611 --> 23:34.079
CHALLENGED AROUND 115 BOOKS,

23:34.079 --> 23:35.614
AMONG THEM TITLES LIKE "AND

23:35.614 --> 23:36.481
TANGO

23:36.481 --> 23:37.716
MAKES THREE", A PICTURE BOOK

23:37.716 --> 23:38.817
BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF TWO

23:38.817 --> 23:40.152
MALE PENGUINS AT THE CENTRAL

23:40.152 --> 23:41.586
PARK ZOO WHO RAISED A BABY CHICK

23:41.586 --> 23:43.655
TOGETHER.

23:43.655 --> 23:45.290
APPARENTLY, ONE OF HER

23:45.290 --> 23:46.024
OBJECTIONS TO IT IS THAT A

23:46.024 --> 23:47.225
SECOND GRADER COULD READ IT,

23:47.225 --> 23:49.427
"AND THE IDEA WOULD POP INTO

23:49.427 --> 23:50.462
THEIR MIND THAT THESE ARE TWO

23:50.462 --> 23:51.329
PEOPLE OF THE SAME SEX THAT LOVE

23:51.329 --> 23:53.799
EACH OTHER."

23:53.799 --> 23:55.534
AND THE PROBLEM IS, SCHOOLS ARE

23:55.534 --> 23:56.768
ACTING ON THOSE SORTS OF

23:56.768 --> 23:57.869
COMPLAINTS.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.337
THERE WAS A RECENT SCHOOL BOARD

23:59.337 --> 24:00.705
MEETING IN THAT COUNTY, TO

24:00.705 --> 24:02.340
ADDRESS THE CALLS TO BAN THREE

24:02.340 --> 24:04.276
OF THE BOOKS ON THAT TEACHER'S

24:04.276 --> 24:05.544
LIST, INCLUDING THE PENGUIN ONE.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.078
MULTIPLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAME

24:07.078 --> 24:08.446
TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF BANNING

24:08.446 --> 24:09.981
IT AND SOME MADE IT ABUNDANTLY

24:09.981 --> 24:11.783
CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT LAW THEY FELT

24:11.783 --> 24:14.019
EMPOWERED THEM.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.221
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN TALK

24:16.221 --> 24:18.957
ABOUT THIS BOOK EXCEPT FOR RIGHT

24:18.957 --> 24:20.525
AND WRONG AS A CLEAR LINE AND

24:20.525 --> 24:22.661
IT'S NOT GRAY SO IT IS BLACK AND

24:22.661 --> 24:23.762
WHITE IT'S BLACK AND WHITE WITH

24:23.762 --> 24:27.199
THE LAW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT H1557

24:27.199 --> 24:27.899
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

24:27.899 --> 24:31.436
INDOCTRINATION.

24:31.436 --> 24:34.172
AND WHEN YOU LOOK UP THIS BOOK

24:34.172 --> 24:35.607
ON DESTINY DISCOVER ON THE

24:35.607 --> 24:38.176
SCHOOLS AND COUNTY WEBSITE THE

24:38.176 --> 24:39.744
BOOK SAYS THIS BOOK IS ABOUT TWO

24:39.744 --> 24:41.913
MALE PENGUINS THAT FALL IN LOVE.

24:41.913 --> 24:45.917
JESUS SAID GO AND SIN NO MORE

24:45.917 --> 24:48.386
SO THIS-- -- THIS IS AGAINST

24:48.386 --> 24:50.755
THE LAW, THANK YOU.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.123
THINK ABOUT THE WORK

24:52.123 --> 24:53.992
HE HAD TO PUT INTO THAT.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.427
THAT MAN HAD TO

24:55.427 --> 24:56.962
SHOWER, PUT ON A PAIR OF PANTS,

24:56.962 --> 24:57.963
DECIDE WHAT SHIRT TO WEAR,

24:57.963 --> 24:59.598
CHOOSE THE LIGHT BLUE ONE THAT'S

24:59.598 --> 25:01.132
TWO SIZES TOO BIG, DRIVE TO THE

25:01.132 --> 25:02.167
MEETING, PARK HIS CAR, WALK INTO

25:02.167 --> 25:02.968
THE BUILDING, WAIT A WHILE FOR

25:02.968 --> 25:04.202
HIS TURN TO SPEAK, ALL SO HE

25:04.202 --> 25:05.237
COULD EVENTUALLY STAND BEHIND A

25:05.237 --> 25:06.738
PODIUM AND SAY OUT LOUD, AS AN

25:06.738 --> 25:08.006
ADULT, THAT HE'S MAD ABOUT GAY

25:08.006 --> 25:09.774
PENGUINS.

25:09.774 --> 25:11.209
YOU ALMOST HAVE TO ADMIRE HIS

25:11.209 --> 25:12.911
DEDICATION TO BEING SUCH A

25:12.911 --> 25:15.347
FUCKING IDIOT.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.888
THAT FUCKING IDIOT WON.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.521
AT THAT MEETING,

25:23.521 --> 25:24.256
THE BOARD VOTED TO AND TANGO

25:24.256 --> 25:25.457
MAKES THREE" FROM ITS SCHOOLS.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.258
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

25:26.258 --> 25:27.125
BOOKS BEING

25:27.125 --> 25:27.759
REMOVED, THE INANE PROCLAMATIONS

25:27.759 --> 25:28.627
TO SHAME TRANS ATHLETES,

25:28.627 --> 25:32.264
SLOPPY ATTEMPTS TO CRIMINALIZE

25:32.264 --> 25:33.098
PROTESTORS, AND YOU COMBINE IT

25:33.098 --> 25:33.732
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE-- FROM THE

25:33.732 --> 25:34.499
SUPPORT FOR RESTRICTIVE ABORTION

25:34.499 --> 25:36.201
BANS, TO THE EFFORTS TO STOP

25:36.201 --> 25:37.569
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE, IT REALLY

25:37.569 --> 25:40.305
BEGINS TO FEEL LIKE "THE FREEST

25:40.305 --> 25:41.306
STATE" IN AMERICA IS ONLY FREE

25:41.306 --> 25:43.041
TO THE EXTENT ANYONE WANTS TO

25:43.041 --> 25:44.409
BEHAVE EXACTLY THE WAY THAT RON

25:44.409 --> 25:46.411
DESANTIS THINKS THEY SHOULD.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.046
AND LOOK-- IN THE MONTHS TO

25:48.046 --> 25:49.080
COME, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT

25:49.080 --> 25:50.181
OF DESANTIS-VERSUS-TRUMP

25:50.181 --> 25:52.517
COMPARISONS.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.386
AND THE TRUTH IS, HE'LL PROBABLY

25:54.386 --> 25:55.687
COME OUT WELL IN A LOT OF THEM,

25:55.687 --> 25:57.822
MORE OR LESS BY DEFAULT.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.057
BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE BAR HERE.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.258
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER

26:00.258 --> 26:00.892
DESANTIS IN HIS OWN RIGHT.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.928
IF DONALD TRUMP NEVER EXISTED--

26:02.928 --> 26:05.797
AND LET'S JUST ALL JUST PAUSE

26:05.797 --> 26:06.865
AND ENJOY THAT HYPOTHETICAL FOR

26:06.865 --> 26:12.938
A SECOND-- IF DONALD TRUMP

26:13.605 --> 26:14.272
NEVER EXISTED, AND YOU WERE

26:14.272 --> 26:15.140
FORCED TO LEARN ABOUT RON

26:15.140 --> 26:16.041
DESANTIS, FROM SCRATCH, WITH NO

26:16.041 --> 26:16.808
BASIS FOR COMPARISON, WHAT YOU'D

26:16.808 --> 26:18.877
SEE WOULD HORRIFY YOU.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.812
BECAUSE YOU'D BE DISCOVERING A

26:20.812 --> 26:22.247
PETTY AUTOCRAT AND A BULLY.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.448
A MAN WITH NO INTEREST IN

26:23.448 --> 26:24.549
HEARING DISSENT, QUESTIONS, OR

26:24.549 --> 26:26.384
THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION OF

26:26.384 --> 26:28.053
"THAI FOOD."

26:28.053 --> 26:29.988
AND ALL IN ALL, A MAN WHO IS--

26:29.988 --> 26:32.123
AND I DO NOT USE THIS TERM

26:32.123 --> 26:34.926
LIGHTLY-- A FUCKING MEATBALL.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.861
AND NOW THIS.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.497
AND NOW.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.468
JERRY O'CONNELL'S WIFE IS A

26:43.468 --> 26:44.736
SCORPIO AND HE NEEDS HELP.

26:44.736 --> 26:45.370
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I DID NOT

26:45.370 --> 26:46.104
BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY EITHER,

26:46.104 --> 26:46.738
WHEN I SOUGHT I DID NOT BELIEVE

26:46.738 --> 26:48.206
IT AND THEN I MARRIED A SCORPIO.

26:48.206 --> 26:52.744
IF YOU MARRY A SCORP, DO WHAT

26:52.744 --> 26:58.049
THEY SAY.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.085
ALL SCORPIOS DO IS VENT.

27:00.085 --> 27:00.618
YOU CAN'T EVER GET HER MAD

27:00.618 --> 27:02.687
BECAUSE MAMA BEAR IS A SCORPIO.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.055
MY WIFE IS A SCORPIO.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.557
I CAN TELL WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS

27:05.557 --> 27:06.391
MARRIED TO ONE, THEY ARE REALLY

27:06.391 --> 27:07.792
GOOD AT FIGHTING.

27:07.792 --> 27:14.466
I'M MARRIED TO A SCORPIO.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.301
WE ARE ONE DRUNK AND LUNCH AWAY

27:16.301 --> 27:18.069
FROM BEING THAT'S AT I'M OUT.

27:18.069 --> 27:19.137
MY WIFE WAS BREASTFEEDING I

27:19.137 --> 27:21.039
DROP A COUPLE OF BAGS ON THE

27:21.039 --> 27:22.540
FLOOR AND MY WIFE IS A SCORPIO,

27:22.540 --> 27:25.510
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT--

27:25.510 --> 27:28.446
REBECCA IS A SCORPIO.

27:28.446 --> 27:29.681
JERRY WOULDN'T DO IT.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.816
SOMETIMES MY WIFE IS LIKE

27:31.816 --> 27:36.054
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:36.054 --> 27:36.688
YOU ARE MARRIED TO A SCORPIO AS

27:36.688 --> 27:41.292
WELL?

27:41.292 --> 27:43.261
WE CAN TALK AFTER THE SHOW.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.734
MOVING ON.

27:49.734 --> 27:50.235
BEFORE WE GO, I WOULD

27:50.235 --> 27:50.869
LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS

27:50.869 --> 27:51.169
ADVERTISING.

27:51.169 --> 27:51.603
WE'RE ALL CONSTANTLY

27:51.603 --> 27:52.237
BOMBARDED BY ADS, AND IT CAN BE

27:52.237 --> 27:53.071
HARD FOR A BRAND TO CUT THROUGH

27:53.071 --> 27:54.105
THE NOISE UNLESS THEY'RE USING A

27:54.105 --> 27:55.373
FLASHY CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT OR

27:55.373 --> 27:57.675
MAKING A MASSIVE FUCK-UP.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.977
LIKE WHEN

27:58.977 --> 28:00.512
VOLKSWAGEN ITALY'S INSTAGRAM

28:00.512 --> 28:01.279
ACCOUNT COMBINED THE WORD

28:01.279 --> 28:02.614
"VOLKSWAGEN" AND THE WORD

28:02.614 --> 28:04.149
"ITALIA", TO SPELL SOMETHING

28:04.149 --> 28:06.618
VERY DIFFERENT.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.453
IT'S LIKE WHAT OPTIMUS PRIME

28:08.453 --> 28:09.354
LOOKS FOR WITH SAFE SEARCH

28:09.354 --> 28:11.556
OFF.

28:11.556 --> 28:13.358
BUT RECENTLY, WE DISCOVERED

28:13.358 --> 28:14.392
THAT A PLUMBING COMPANY FROM

28:14.392 --> 28:15.627
AUSTIN, TEXAS HAD MADE A

28:15.627 --> 28:16.928
COMMERCIAL SO BOLD IT DARED YOU

28:16.928 --> 28:19.230
NOT TO PAY ATTENTION.

28:19.230 --> 28:19.864
THERE

28:19.864 --> 28:21.499
WAS A TIME WHERE HOMEOWNERS

28:21.499 --> 28:22.801
DEALT WITH UNRULY ACS, TOILETS,

28:22.801 --> 28:24.803
AND WATER HEATERS."

28:24.803 --> 28:26.571
NO OTHER TEAM COULD HANDLE THE

28:26.571 --> 28:28.406
FIGHT.

28:28.406 --> 28:33.344
BUT THERE REMAINED A BEACON OF

28:33.344 --> 28:34.179
HOPE IN A GROUP OF SUPERHEROES

28:34.179 --> 28:35.413
JUST ONE CALL AWAY.

28:35.413 --> 28:41.719
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

28:41.719 --> 28:47.525
DISPATCH, I'M EN ROUTE.

28:47.525 --> 28:48.693
JUST CALL RADIANT.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.729
YEAH, EXACTLY.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.231
YEAH, THAT AVENGERS PARODY IS

28:53.231 --> 28:54.332
AN AD FOR A LOCAL PLUMBING

28:54.332 --> 28:55.300
COMPANY.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.135
HONESTLY, I'VE GOT NO NOTES.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.137
WELL, I DO HAVE ONE: WHO THE

28:59.137 --> 28:59.938
FUCK IS THE GUY ON THE LEFT

28:59.938 --> 29:01.706
SUPPOSED TO BE?

29:01.706 --> 29:02.674
I'M NOT AN AVENGERS BUFF BUT I'M

29:02.674 --> 29:03.842
PRETTY SURE THERE'S NO DOG GUY.

29:03.842 --> 29:04.576
BUT PLEASE, TELL ME I'M WRONG,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.111
INTERNET.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.545
I'D LOVE TO GET A THOUSAND

29:07.545 --> 29:09.214
TWEETS ABOUT THIS FROM YOU

29:09.214 --> 29:10.682
NERDS, "WELL ACTUALLY JOHN IF

29:10.682 --> 29:12.150
YOU LOOK CLOSELY IN THE AVENGERS

29:12.150 --> 29:14.352
ISSUE FOUR FIVE SEVEN, THE

29:14.352 --> 29:15.787
EXISTENCE OF A RADIOACTIVE DOG

29:15.787 --> 29:18.323
ISN'T OUT OF THE QUESTION."

29:18.323 --> 29:19.090
TELL ME, PLEASE.

29:19.090 --> 29:19.991
BECAUSE I'M LOOKIN' AT THIS GUY

29:19.991 --> 29:21.526
AND I'M THINKING THERE'S

29:21.526 --> 29:22.293
ABSOLUTELY NO RADIOACTI-- OH

29:22.293 --> 29:22.894
SHIT, THAT'S THE RACCOON ISN'T

29:22.894 --> 29:25.997
IT?

29:25.997 --> 29:28.466
IT'S THE RACCOON.

29:28.466 --> 29:29.067
HE'S THE RACCOON WITH A DIRTY

29:29.067 --> 29:30.435
MOUTH AND A TREE FOR A FRIEND.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.035
IT'S MY MISTAKE I TAKE ALL OF

29:31.035 --> 29:31.503
THAT BACK.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.270
IF ALL THIS COMPANY

29:32.270 --> 29:33.004
HAD MADE WAS THAT ONE

29:33.004 --> 29:33.638
MOVIE-THEMED AD, THAT WOULD HAVE

29:33.638 --> 29:35.206
BEEN ENOUGH.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.941
BUT IT TURNS OUT, RADIANT

29:36.941 --> 29:37.976
PLUMBING DOES THIS A LOT.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.110
BECAUSE LAST YEAR, THEY ALSO

29:39.110 --> 29:40.378
MANAGED TO TURN A CERTAIN

29:40.378 --> 29:41.613
TRANSHUMANIST EPIC ABOUT THE

29:41.613 --> 29:42.580
DANGERS OF MESSIANIC PROPHECIES

29:42.580 --> 29:44.282
INTO AN AD, TOO.

29:48.219 --> 29:49.320
THE PEOPLE ASK US TO BRING

29:49.320 --> 29:51.956
PEACE TO THE CITY OF AUSTIN.

29:51.956 --> 29:56.794

30:00.899 --> 30:05.470
YOUR MIND.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.206
YOU MUST FACE YOUR FEARS.

COME WITH ME.

30:12.977 --> 30:17.182
YOU NEED TO BE READY.

INCREDIBLE.

30:29.627 --> 30:30.261
THE CASTING ALONE!

30:30.261 --> 30:30.862
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

30:30.862 --> 30:33.331
HE'S MORE OF A TIMOTHEE CHALAMET

30:33.331 --> 30:34.332
TYPE THAN THE REAL TIMOTHEE

30:34.332 --> 30:35.733
CHALAMET.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.501
HE'S GOT THAT SIGNATURE CHALAMET

30:36.501 --> 30:37.168
AIR OF MYSTERY WHERE YOU'RE NOT

30:37.168 --> 30:37.969

30:37.969 --> 30:38.536
RAP AT YOU OR DO WHIP ITS IN

30:38.536 --> 30:39.204
YOUR MOM'S BASEMENT.

30:39.204 --> 30:39.871
AND AS FOR ENDING WITH THIS

30:39.871 --> 30:40.471
GIANT TOILET SANDWORM?!

30:40.471 --> 30:41.339
"AVATAR WAY OF WET" CAN GO FUCK

30:41.339 --> 30:42.140

30:46.110 --> 30:46.878
THAT IS THE TITLE THEY CHOSE FOR

30:47.912 --> 30:50.148
TOILET DUNE.

30:50.148 --> 30:50.982
NO NEED TO THINK TOO HARD ON

30:50.982 --> 30:52.283

30:52.283 --> 30:54.018
IT'S TOILET AND IT'S DUNE.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.659
VERSATILE THEY ARE IN THE MEDIUM

31:01.659 --> 31:03.061
OF TOILET CINEMA.

31:03.061 --> 31:04.696
THEY'VE DONE STAR

31:04.696 --> 31:05.730
WARS, IN WHICH R2-D2 IS PLAYED

31:05.730 --> 31:07.365
BY A TOILET.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.766
THEY'VE DONE A "SCREAM" PARODY

31:08.766 --> 31:10.034
FOR HALLOWEEN, AND THREE YEARS

31:10.034 --> 31:10.835
AGO, THEY EVEN ROLLED OUT A

31:10.835 --> 31:12.237
SERIES OF ADS PARODYING

31:12.237 --> 31:13.738
"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE", A MOVIE

31:13.738 --> 31:14.739
THAT WAS, AT THAT POINT, A MERE

31:14.739 --> 31:17.642
16 YEARS OLD.

31:29.287 --> 31:32.957
JURASSIC TOILET.

31:32.957 --> 31:34.125
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR AT

31:34.125 --> 31:35.159
THIS POINT-- I HAVE NO IDEA HOW

31:35.159 --> 31:40.965
GOOD AT PLUMBING RADIANT

31:40.965 --> 31:41.666
PLUMBING IS.

31:41.666 --> 31:42.400
GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPEND

31:42.400 --> 31:43.234
MAKING THESE ADS, THEY COULD

31:43.234 --> 31:44.002
WELL BE TERRIBLE.

31:44.002 --> 31:44.702
