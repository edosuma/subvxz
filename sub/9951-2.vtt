WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:02.992
- Previously on Haven...

00:04.296 --> 00:06.412
- FBI! Who are you?
- Haven PD. Who are you?

00:06.548 --> 00:07.833
- FBI. Are you deaf?

00:07.966 --> 00:09.547
- Chief Wuornos, this is—

00:09.676 --> 00:11.007
- Special Agent Audrey Parker.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.046
- Gun trace came in.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.385
It belongs to a guy I know:

00:13.514 --> 00:14.629
Duke Crocker.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.512
- You took my clothes.
- I saved your life.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.181
- You must be Duke.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.725
Oh!
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.563
- It's all right.
I didn't feel it.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.683
- You seriously can't feel pain?
- No.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.275
- Dave Tiggs.
My brother, Vince.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.564
Publishers of the Haven Herald.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.904
- This could be why I thought
I recognize you.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.068
- She looks like you.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.236
- Yeah, I know.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.779
You know that vacation time
I never take?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.072
I need a few weeks.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.911
There's just something
I need to look into.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.747
- She's staying.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.491
Maybe she can help you
with your troubles.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.993
[loud rumbling]

00:52.469 --> 00:53.709
- Good night.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.598
Running late again, Otis.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.763
I'll be back tomorrow
to finish the week's receipts.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.602
- Sounds good.
- Hannah!

01:04.731 --> 01:05.891
- Dad.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.639
- I thought you said you weren't
working here anymore.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.277
- Well, I'm not working
very much.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.314
- This is time you should
be spending with Bobby

01:11.446 --> 01:13.186
or volunteering,

01:13.323 --> 01:15.188
not wasting your time
in this pit of a bar.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.281
- Hey! Watch your mouth.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.073
- Listen, if you want
to spend your time

01:20.205 --> 01:22.116
selling poison to losers,
that's your business.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.455
If my daughter
wants to waste her time

01:23.584 --> 01:25.245
bookkeeping for you,
that's minel

01:25.377 --> 01:27.459
- Come on inside.
I'll buy you a drink.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.455
You liked it straight up,
from what I remember, right?

01:35.387 --> 01:37.127
- You take care, Otis.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.300
Hannah, let's go!

01:41.268 --> 01:42.132
- Come on, sweetheart.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.134
I'm sorry.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.641
- What the hell?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.850
[dramatic music]

02:32.986 --> 02:40.984
J‘J‘

03:07.187 --> 03:09.894
- Sandwich meatball?
What?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.435
I wonder when they put that
on the menu.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.070
Well, good morning to you too,
Agent Parker.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.530
- I need to know more
abouthen

03:22.035 --> 03:25.402
- I'm fine, thank you very much.
Nice of you to ask.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.904
I didn't know
you were still in town.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.904
- That's it?

03:28.041 --> 03:31.329
That's all I get,
the folksy, local cop brush-off?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.042
- I was shooting for civil.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.205
- Okay, you know what?
You—

03:38.719 --> 03:41.085
My bad.
Let me take this again.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.595
You were the local beat cop
in that photo, right?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.761
You would've taken a witness
statement from that woman.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.633
- Maybe.
It was a long time ago.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.976
- Wouldn't there be
an evidence file?

03:50.105 --> 03:53.518
- It was a long, time, ago.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.016
- This is a funny town
you've got here.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.484
- Well I'd say "unique."

03:57.612 --> 03:59.477
Now, is there a point
coming my way?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.981
- I've been a lot of help
to you recently—discreet help.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.109
And I was just hoping
for a little quid pro quo.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.360
- Ooh, that sounds illicit.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.656
- I was shooting for civil.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.495
- [laughs]

04:09.624 --> 04:10.534
All right.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.168
Okay, you know what?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.909
It's gonna take
a couple of days.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.251
How long are you
gonna be in town?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.540
- Well, that depends on you.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.629
- Okay, well, my advice to you
is, just relax.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.794
Enjoy yourself.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.462
You know what you ought to do
is go and visit

04:21.595 --> 04:22.801
the Haven moose farm.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.465
Not to be missed.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.929
Enjoy the vacation.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.139
- I don't do vacations.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.226
- Then look at it
like a learning opportunity.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.970
- Dad.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.392
- Hey.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.514
- You're still in Haven.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.734
- Oh, apparently,
I'm vacationing.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.821
- [coughs]

04:42.949 --> 04:46.032
- Actually, I'm looking
into the woman in the picture...

04:46.161 --> 04:47.321
unsuccessfully.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.240
- What can we do for you,
Nathan?

04:49.372 --> 04:52.159
- There's something strange
down at the Rust Bucket.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.623
I'm heading out.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.663
- Hey, can I tag along?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.502
I'm not really big
on the moose museum.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.871
- It's actually a farm.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.417
- Farm, gallery, museum...

05:00.550 --> 05:01.505
Can I come?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.842
- Well—
- I think it's a good idea.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.303
Nathan here can use
all the help he can get.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.094
- After you.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.141
- Finally, some peace.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.687
[people speaking indistinctly]

05:23.824 --> 05:25.360
- Whoa.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.777
All right,
so first question is,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.196
why is there
a giant metal ball?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.320
- Oh, everyone knows that ball.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.367
- Second question:

05:33.500 --> 05:35.206
there's a ball
everyone knows about?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.620
- Yeah, it's part of a sculpture

05:36.753 --> 05:38.789
that's usually
up on Green Street.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.083
Been there forever.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.707
Every year, high school seniors
try and steal it,

05:43.844 --> 05:45.550
fail, pick something else.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.010
- And they fail because...

05:47.138 --> 05:49.049
- It's a big bronze ball.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.592
- Someone's gonna pay for this!

05:50.725 --> 05:52.181
- Excuse me, sir.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.847
Agent—uh, Officer Parker,

05:54.980 --> 05:57.266
Haven PD...sort of.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.388
Did you see anything?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.062
- Yeah, a big metal ball
crushed my place.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.231
- Was there anybody pushing it
or a truck that unloaded it?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.070
- Just a ball
rolling down the hill.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.155
- How about is there a person
in particular

06:08.285 --> 06:10.241
that you may have upset
recently?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.782
- Ed Driscoll
was in my face last night.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.495
- Driscoll was here?

06:14.624 --> 06:15.579
- Yeah.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.792
He's not a big fan of this place
since he gave up drinking.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.332
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.591
I also know his place
is up on Green Street.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.129
- Where the ball was
up until last night.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.252
You don't mind, do you?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.548
- Mind what?

06:29.681 --> 06:31.717
- That I invited myself along.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.466
- It's a huge metal ball.
Who could resist that?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.264
- Exactly.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.103
- Well, there's nothing
complicated about that ball.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.267
Outer shell of bronze,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.857
filled with about three tons
of sand.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.443
- And how long would you say
it's been anchored here?

06:45.572 --> 06:49.190
- Church bought it in '68,
installed in '69.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.533
Too heavy to move after.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.912
- No rust on these chains.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.120
- Oh, I only put them on
last year.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.409
The new insurance company
made us do it.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.158
I told them the ball
wasn't going anywhere.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.126
- Bet you wish
you hadn't said that.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.746
- All right,
let's go find Driscoll.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.470
Well, he doesn't look
like the kind of guy

07:20.607 --> 07:22.188
who'd get in fights
with bartenders

07:22.317 --> 07:24.478
and then destroy the place.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.818
- Just wait
until he opens his mouth.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.608
- Why, do you know him well?

07:28.740 --> 07:29.820
- More than I'd like.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.487
- This child belongs to God now.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.950
all:
Amen.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.697
- He will walk in the path
of the Lord with us.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.369
It is up to each
and every one of us

07:40.502 --> 07:43.619
to keep him
on that path.

07:43.755 --> 07:44.710
Hallelujah!

07:44.839 --> 07:46.340
all:
Hallelujah!

07:46.466 --> 07:50.050
- The best chance he has
of staying on God's path

07:50.178 --> 07:52.260
is to live amongst the godly

07:52.389 --> 07:56.849
and to steer clear
of the troubled and the ungodly.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.513
Can I hear an "amen"?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.510
all:
Amen.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.776
- Haven...

08:11.908 --> 08:15.992
is a fine place
to raise a family.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.284
But you and I know...

08:19.416 --> 08:22.624
it is chock-full
of the ungodly!

08:22.752 --> 08:23.867
Can I hear an "amen"?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.494
all:
Amen.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.256
- What the hell was that?

08:34.389 --> 08:35.720
- I have some history
with the rev.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.056
- Yeah, well, you think you
could have told me that before?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.675
- Probably should've.
- Yeah. Probably should've.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.811
Okay, so what do you know
about him?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.773
- He's a pompous,
self-righteous ass.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.768
Never been violent,
as far as I know, just angry.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.520
Been that way
since his wife died.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.898
- All right, so do you think
you can keep that to yourself

08:55.035 --> 08:57.367
while we go talk to the rev?

09:13.053 --> 09:15.214
Hello?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.931
- You left in a hurry.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.927
And you must be
Special Agent Parker.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.599
- You keeping tabs on me,
Reverend?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.971
- You're here
about the sculpture.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.484
- Tell us about the Rust Bucket.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.067
- It's a cesspool.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.983
Someone in the town did us
a favor and destroyed it.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.777
- That someone being you?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.947
- Agent Parker, has anyone
taken the opportunity

09:40.080 --> 09:42.116
to welcome you properly
to our town?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.159
- Answer Nathan's question.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.376
- I don't condone violence
of any kind.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.370
If wanted to destroy that bar,

09:50.507 --> 09:52.998
would I use a sculpture
from this very church?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.796
- Then why were you yelling
at the bartender last night?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.045
- Hmm. Perfect timing.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.091
Hannah!

09:59.224 --> 10:01.886
Special Agent Parker,
this is my daughter Hannah

10:02.018 --> 10:04.179
and her foster son, Bobby.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.644
- Hi.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.641
- Bobby, I told you, don't bring
that bike in the church.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.642
- I'm sorry.
I forgot.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.647
- Hannah, would you mind
telling Agent Parker

10:16.783 --> 10:19.399
why I was expressing
my frustration

10:19.536 --> 10:21.151
in the bar last night?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.994
- Well, I'd, um—l'd rather not.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.284
- My daughter hid from me
the fact

10:25.416 --> 10:27.077
that she was working there.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.122
And I went there to bring her
back to do God's work,

10:30.255 --> 10:33.338
where her talents
can be a better service.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.004
- Dad, everyone's waiting
for you at the reception.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.253
- Duty calls.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.755
- Hannah, do you have anything
that you may want to tell us

10:41.891 --> 10:43.506
about what happened
at the Rust Bucket?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.134
- No, sorry.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.227
I only started working there,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.017
and we left
hours before it happened.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.062
- Bobby, you heard anything?
- No, sir.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.025
- You mind keeping
an ear out for us?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.816
- Sure, Nathan.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.403
- Agent Parker?

11:00.535 --> 11:03.868
My daughter Hannah makes
a dynamite seafood stew,

11:03.997 --> 11:06.579
every Sunday night,
so if you're free,

11:06.708 --> 11:07.663
we'd love to be able

11:07.792 --> 11:09.407
to welcome you properly
to our town.

11:09.544 --> 11:13.002
- Thanks, but I have this whole
gigantic metal ball thing

11:13.131 --> 11:14.587
that I have to look into.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.167
And I don't think
you're telling us everything

11:19.304 --> 11:22.546
about why you were
at the Rust Bucket.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.391
- Audrey, you're not from here,

11:27.520 --> 11:30.853
so I've given you
the benefit of the doubt.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.813
But let me make
something clear:

11:32.942 --> 11:37.026
those are the last questions
I'll answer about that place.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.156
- Wow, what a sweetheart.

11:43.661 --> 11:47.529
So what was that
between you and his daughter?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.623
- I asked Hannah to the prom
without her father's permission.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.210
He found out
and said she couldn't go.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.581
- So the prom is why the rev
would barely look at you?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.833
- Well, that,
and 'cause we ignored him,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.346
went up to the ledge,
and watched a meteor shower.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.632
- And...

12:03.765 --> 12:05.596
- And...

12:05.725 --> 12:07.932
meteor showers
are better naked.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.143
- Nathan Wuornos!
- Uh-huh.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.260
- Just another teenage boy

12:11.397 --> 12:13.103
trying to take
a girl's clothes off.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.598
- No, the meteor shower
was my idea.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.725
The rest was hers.
- Ah.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.917
[touch-tones beeping]

12:49.435 --> 12:52.302
Polyester is so beneath you.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.920
[gasps]

13:29.434 --> 13:33.177
[line ringing]

13:33.313 --> 13:34.723
- Hello?

13:34.856 --> 13:36.392
- Nathan!
- Parker?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.640
- Nathan!
- Parker!

13:39.861 --> 13:41.192
Audrey!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.690
- What did I do on my vacation?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.532
You came and cut me out.
No big deal.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
- Still think
you should get checked out.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.871
- You know what?
I'll—I'll live, okay?

13:57.003 --> 13:58.584
And I know you'll think
this is ridiculous,

13:58.713 --> 13:59.702
but when you think about it,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.249
it's got to be the rev
that's doing it.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.542
He collects butterflies,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.212
and I saw a butterfly
right before I was cocooned.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.210
God, I can't believe
I'm saying that.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.087
- Me either.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.054
- Look, you can deny
that strange things

14:11.184 --> 14:12.469
are going on around here,

14:12.602 --> 14:15.309
but we need to press the rev,
and we need to press him hard.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.144
- What are you gonna say?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.434
"You wrapped me up in a cocoon.
Confess."

14:19.567 --> 14:21.398
- Yeah, you might have a point.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.859
- We need to talk to Hannah
without the rev around.

14:23.988 --> 14:24.943
I already called
the church office.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.279
She's at the food bank.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.568
Her favorite days are when
her father's somewhere else.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.362
- They said that?

14:30.495 --> 14:34.079
- Well, I might have added
that part.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.089
- Here you go, Howard.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.379
- Thank you.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.886
Bobby, I'm gonna take
a break, okay?

14:54.018 --> 14:56.634
- You know what?
A break sounds great.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.604
- Hannah, can I talk alone
with you for a minute?

14:59.732 --> 15:02.144
- Well—
- Bobby, let's take a walk.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.608
- Okay.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.147
- Thanks.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.949
- It's really great
that Bobby

15:09.075 --> 15:11.066
does volunteer work
with you like that.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.615
- Well, to tell you the truth,
he won't leave my side.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.123
Getting him to school
in the morning

15:16.249 --> 15:18.365
is not for the faint of heart,
believe me.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.664
- So you're his
foster mom, right?

15:21.796 --> 15:24.333
- Well, my dad
took him in a year ago.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.126
Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.999
- His family
was in a car accident.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.343
Bobby was the only survivor.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.555
- So your dad took him in,
but you're his foster mom?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.140
- Dad's good
at the big gestures.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.476
It's the day-to-day stuff
that bores him.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.514
- Yeah.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.308
You know,
taking in a child,

15:41.441 --> 15:45.150
that's, uh—that's an amazing,
beautiful thing.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.150
- Actually, you know what?
I didn't think I could do it.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.821
What the rev wants,
the rev gets.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.990
And now I can't imagine life
without him.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.075
- The rev's not easy.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.997
- He's okay.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.337
He's the one that brought me
home from the hospital

16:06.466 --> 16:07.672
when my parents died.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.543
And I don't think I came out
of my room for a week,

16:11.679 --> 16:14.512
and he didn't try to make me.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.972
And after a while, I started
coming down for breakfast,

16:17.101 --> 16:20.844
and he didn't say a word to me,
just brought me to school.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.265
He's cool that way.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.434
- Is he always cool that way?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.773
Between me and you,
I promise.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.527
- He has moods.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.744
And when he gets weird,
I just go to my room, but...

16:38.873 --> 16:40.864
Hannah just takes it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.867
She's just more used to it,
I guess.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.710
- Your dad has quite a temper,
doesn't he?

16:46.839 --> 16:50.127
- He doesn't like surprises,
that's all.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.001
He's just—
he's protective.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.594
- Is that why he doesn't
want you to work?

16:59.185 --> 17:02.052
- You know,
I know that it's pathetic

17:02.188 --> 17:05.305
that I don't stand up to him.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.729
I always promise myself I will,
and then I never do.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.570
If you'll excuse me,
I have to finish this.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.039
- Agent Parker!

17:27.004 --> 17:28.665
How dare you?
- Hold on, Rev.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.756
- Harass my daughter
when she's doing God's work!

17:31.884 --> 17:32.873
- You hit your daughter, Rev?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.626
- l have nothing
to explain to you.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.129
- Nathan.
- I see it.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.257
- What are you doing?

17:40.393 --> 17:41.633
Hey!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.430
- The last time I saw
a butterfly like that,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.099
I ended up in a cocoon.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.937
- Have you both
lost your minds?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.403
[groaning]

18:04.458 --> 18:05.834
What's happening?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.076
My God!
What's happening?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.459
[engine turns over]

18:14.760 --> 18:17.137
Hey! What are you doing?

18:20.683 --> 18:21.843
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.603
- [exhales deeply]

18:36.866 --> 18:38.151
So you think I'm crazy now?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.694
- I never said you were crazy.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.067
- This isn't
the first weird thing

18:41.203 --> 18:42.363
I've seen in Haven, Nathan,

18:42.496 --> 18:43.576
and I've only been here a week,

18:43.706 --> 18:46.163
so just—can you tell me
what's going on?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.874
- Every town's got
a few skeletons in the closet.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.585
- Well, this is a big
freaking closet.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.500
All right,
can we at least agree

18:53.633 --> 18:56.215
that whatever's going on here,
this is not normal?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.254
- Yeah.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.501
- And can we also agree

18:58.638 --> 19:00.503
that whoever's behind this,
it can't be the rev?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.346
- Unfortunately.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.181
- Which means
it's someone else.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.846
- Did I say,
"unfortunately"?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.060
- [chuckles]

19:11.901 --> 19:13.857
You know what's not
working for me?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.692
- The Bucket.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.357
- Yup.
Why isn't it working for you?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.105
- Since the rev's
no longer a suspect,

19:19.241 --> 19:22.028
the bar's got nothing to do
with the hotel or the church.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.867
- They do have
one thing in common.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.113
- What's that?
- Hannah Driscoll.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.082
- Hannah's got nothing
to do with this.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.951
- She worked at the Bucket,

19:32.088 --> 19:33.544
she was there
when l grilled her father,

19:33.673 --> 19:34.879
and she has issues
with the rev.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.793
- But she didn't have issues
with the Rust Bucket.

19:36.926 --> 19:37.836
why destroy it?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.799
- Okay, let's get
the bartender in here

19:39.929 --> 19:41.044
and see what we can find out.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.590
- Fine.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.810
- What was Hannah Driscoll
doing for you?

19:49.939 --> 19:53.056
- Just bookkeeping,
deposits, payroll,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.056
like that.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.603
- Does she have any reason
not to like you?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.067
- Why? What did she say to you?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.402
- Just answer the question.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.691
- l was gonna fire her.

19:59.824 --> 20:00.984
- Why?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.232
- She was dipping in the till.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.983
- Hannah Driscoll?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.735
- I told her I was thinking
of letting her go

20:05.871 --> 20:07.827
right before
this freak ball thing.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.788
- Can you give us a second?

20:14.296 --> 20:15.456
If he was firing her,

20:15.589 --> 20:17.716
it would give her motive
to destroy the place.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.252
- I don't see Hannah stealing.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.751
- Nathan, your prom
was last century.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.754
She had a strong motive
to attack me.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.051
- I could subpoena
her bank records.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.600
- I'm sorry,
but yeah—

20:29.729 --> 20:31.811
yeah, I think
you need to do that.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.685
- Just heard back from the bank.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.275
Hannah Driscoll doesn't have
a bank account in Haven.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.360
- Damn, I had a good feeling
about that one.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.481
- But Hannah has $57,000
in an account in Bangor—

20:43.617 --> 20:45.482
far enough away to keep it
secret from the rev.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.904
- Well, you could've led
with that.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.197
- Mm, could've.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.965
- I got nothing to say to you

21:01.093 --> 21:04.256
except get the hell
off my porch.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.548
- Now, that's just unfriendly,

21:05.681 --> 21:07.217
considering
we just saved your life.

21:08.934 --> 21:09.798
- You looking for the Lord

21:09.935 --> 21:11.846
in the bottom
of a scotch bottle?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.186
- I take Him where I find Him.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.689
- We're here to see Hannah.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.479
- She's not here.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.818
- Where is she?

21:20.946 --> 21:22.152
- Out.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.487
- Where?
- Rev.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.481
- Don't you call me that!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.360
- Reverend Driscoll,
I think that Hannah

21:28.496 --> 21:29.952
was the one
that attacked you.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.332
- Then you're a fool,
Officer Parker,

21:32.458 --> 21:35.416
because I wasn't attacked.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.500
- Well, then what would you
call it?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.837
Did you know that Hannah
had almost $60,000

21:39.965 --> 21:41.250
in a bank account?

21:41.383 --> 21:43.419
She was fired for stealing
from the Rust Bucket.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.803
That's why she destroyed it.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.217
- That's not possible.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.591
- Hey, Hannah?
Are you here?

21:51.727 --> 21:54.639
- She's not here.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.433
She's at the junior high school
science club.

22:03.697 --> 22:08.612
Oh, I pity you, Nathan.

22:10.621 --> 22:14.705
You walk alone, but you think
your shadow is the Lord's.

22:16.544 --> 22:23.712
But the lord cast you out,
and now you're truly alone.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.674
- Maybe I am alone.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.423
Maybe I always will be.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.925
But I'm not trying
to lose myself

22:34.061 --> 22:36.723
in the bottom of a bottle.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.972
- Nathan.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.236
Nathan, let's go.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.869
[people chatting indistinctly]

23:08.554 --> 23:10.795
- I remember
when I was in the science club.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.762
Feels like 100 years ago.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.053
- That's 'cause it was
100 years ago.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.220
- Thank you.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.604
- Thanks for helping me out
with this.

23:17.730 --> 23:22.394
- Hey, that's what—
that's what friends do.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.982
Now, Bobby, you look exhausted.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.442
You're not getting
enough sleep.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.278
How late did you stay up
working on this?

23:28.407 --> 23:29.908
- Most of the night.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.620
Need to beat your score.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.327
- Well, you finish setting up,

23:35.456 --> 23:39.620
and I am gonna see if I can
bribe a judge or two.

23:39.752 --> 23:44.462
- All right, well,
I like the way you think.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.759
Mary Lou.
- Hi!

23:56.268 --> 23:58.133
- Hannah, is there
someplace we can talk?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.306
- Is my father all right?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.940
He said that he was gonna
take it easy

24:02.066 --> 24:05.399
after that. . .event.

24:05.527 --> 24:09.611
- We need to know why you have
$57,000 in the bank.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.406
- Hannah,

24:12.534 --> 24:14.035
were you stealing
from the Rust Bucket?

24:14.161 --> 24:15.822
Is that why you destroyed it?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.866
- Is that what Otis told you?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.829
- Is it true?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.496
- Otis stopped
repaying his bank loan.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.960
The bank hired me
to audit his books.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.080
Call them.
They'll confirm.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.923
Otis is the one who's skimming.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.417
- Otis is stealing?

24:31.553 --> 24:32.759
- I earned that money.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.344
- How?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.553
- Took me seven years,

24:35.683 --> 24:37.344
and the bank
wasn't my only client.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.977
And I didn't put the money
in Haven

24:39.103 --> 24:42.266
because my father knows
everybody, and he—

24:42.398 --> 24:43.683
he would find out.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.477
- He would find out what?

24:45.609 --> 24:48.396
- I would leave him,
just like my mother did.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.235
- Your mother died.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.104
- She died three days
after she ran away

24:52.241 --> 24:54.232
with the deacon in the church.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.484
Not the story
my dad tells, is it?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.574
If you'll excuse me, I have
a few things I have to do

24:59.707 --> 25:02.039
before I get back
to help Bobby.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.419
He has a booth on butterflies.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.545
- Butterflies?

25:25.482 --> 25:27.393
- Hey, Bobby.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.732
You here for practice?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.193
- No, I just forgot something
in my locker.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.154
- If you change your mind,
just come on out anytime.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.069
The team misses you.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.485
- Will do, Coach.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.662
- Bobby?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.757
Bobby!
- Hey!

26:00.392 --> 26:01.928
-Cmp

26:02.061 --> 26:03.551
This is gonna suck.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.771
[electricity crackling]

26:22.873 --> 26:26.741
[water trickling]

26:27.419 --> 26:29.034
- All right.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.968
[groans]

26:47.940 --> 26:50.682
- Uh, bench!
- Yeah, yeah.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.695
The fire alarm.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.111
Hopefully that'll get us
out of here quickly.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.620
Yeah.
Hang on.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.917
[fire alarm ringing]

27:24.476 --> 27:26.637
What the hell
just happened here?

27:31.275 --> 27:32.355
- He's a great kid.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.566
- There's nothing strange?
You haven't had any problems?

27:34.695 --> 27:36.811
- After what Bobby went through
with his parents,

27:36.947 --> 27:39.029
it's amazing there aren't.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.366
Especially since I know
Bobby's always felt responsible.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.870
- He does? Why?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.282
- Survivor's guilt.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.121
He's the only one
who made it out of the car.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.239
- What happened?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.207
- Driving home
from the family cabin,

27:51.336 --> 27:53.452
car lost control.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.046
I don't think the kid's had
a decent night's sleep since.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.631
- Did you see him leave?

27:57.759 --> 28:00.250
- Miss Driscoll took him home
after the fire alarm.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.593
Probably had to wake him up,
though.

28:01.722 --> 28:02.711
- Wait. Wake him up?

28:02.848 --> 28:06.056
- I think he was catching a nap
right here in the locker room.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.928
Not the first time either,
since the accident.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.727
- Bobby? Hannah?
Anybody home?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.192
- What the hell
happened here?

28:27.122 --> 28:29.659
- Mm, Rev found
the bottom of the bottle.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.577
- [groans]

28:33.962 --> 28:36.419
- Let's go see
if Bobby's in his room.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.416
Bobby!

28:42.721 --> 28:46.054
- I don't think
they came back here.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.441
- Hey, do you see that?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.613
Does it remind you of anything?

29:03.742 --> 29:05.733
- A certain metal ball.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.533
And these.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.658
The rev's necklace
was pulled like a magnet.

29:15.254 --> 29:19.543
- Ah, my personal favorite,
the hotel cocoon experience.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.337
- And the water and the wire
in the school hallway...

29:22.469 --> 29:25.836
these are the things Bobby sees
before he falls asleep.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.589
They must be working their way
into his dreams.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.590
- All right, when you dream,
it mixes everything up

29:30.727 --> 29:32.638
and it combines it
with your fears.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.853
The attacks came out of that,

29:34.982 --> 29:36.813
and he thought
we were coming after him.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.807
- Maybe break up
his new family.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.151
- He's trying to stay awake.
He doesn't want to dream.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.736
- He knows he's hurting people.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.196
- We need to find him
before he falls asleep again.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.941
- Where would Bobby
and Hannah go, Rev?

29:48.078 --> 29:49.989
- Why should I tell you?

29:50.122 --> 29:51.328
- Sooner you tell me,

29:51.456 --> 29:52.832
the sooner
I'm out of your house.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.036
- Miller's Crust.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.831
His parents
had a cabin up there.

29:58.964 --> 30:02.206
Just past where they were killed
at Twin Pines Overlook.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.333
Now get the hell out of here!

30:04.469 --> 30:05.845
- Works for me.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.007
- That boy...

30:08.140 --> 30:09.971
isn't one of God's people.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.091
He's one of yours, Nathan.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.889
That's why I never let you
near my daughter,

30:15.022 --> 30:16.432
because you would have
killed her,

30:16.565 --> 30:19.352
just like your people
killed my Penny.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.816
- Hmm.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.776
Way I heard it,
she was free of you

30:23.905 --> 30:27.068
for three days
before she died.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.065
Probably the best three days
of her life.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.410
- All right, you know what?

30:32.539 --> 30:34.780
Not now, Nathan.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.703
- The troubles are back,
like it or not!

30:37.836 --> 30:41.078
You find that boy,

30:41.214 --> 30:43.500
don't bring him back here!

30:45.761 --> 30:48.218
[crickets chirping]

30:48.347 --> 30:49.427
- Kiddo, why don't you lie down,

30:49.556 --> 30:50.841
and I'll make you
something to eat?

30:50.974 --> 30:53.386
Something incredibly unhealthy.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.434
- How about just a coffee?

30:56.563 --> 30:57.552
- No.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.225
When did you start
drinking coffee?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.940
- A while ago.
- You should be sleeping.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.900
- Hannah, can we talk
about something?

31:04.029 --> 31:05.519
- Anything.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.076
- What was that stuff
about the troubles?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.745
- I don't want
to talk about it.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.162
- All right.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.290
Are you okay?

31:23.423 --> 31:25.755
- I'm okay.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.340
- I know, but it must
have been tough—

31:27.469 --> 31:29.835
- I'm okay!

31:33.100 --> 31:35.091
But thanks.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.392
- Bobby, you can't
really believe that.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.937
- I don't want to,
but when I wake up,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.526
the things that I dreamed
happened.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.613
- Sometimes I don't sleep much
either, and when I don't,

31:49.741 --> 31:51.527
it really messes
with how I'm thinking.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.072
- That's not
what's happening to me.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.740
- No.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.954
No, I know it isn't.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.039
I'm just saying
that problems

32:00.168 --> 32:02.830
are so much easier to work on
when you're rested.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.828
And you're so exhausted.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.331
- Can we just agree to disagree
on that one?

32:07.467 --> 32:10.300
- Sure.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.590
[line ringing]

32:12.722 --> 32:15.885
Hi, this is Hannah.
Please leave a message.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.553
- Hannah,
this is Officer Parker.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.972
I need you to make sure
that Bobby doesn't fall asleep.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.017
I'll explain when we get there.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.436
[sighs]

32:25.569 --> 32:27.935
- Twin Pines Overlook's
coming up soon.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.107
About ten minutes.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.443
- [gasps]

32:32.576 --> 32:35.568
Uh...

32:36.830 --> 32:38.570
- Don't need to say it.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.590
- I'm pretty sure
that's not gonna help.

32:54.723 --> 32:59.092
Bobby must be dreaming.
We have to wake him up.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.138
[horn honks]

33:01.271 --> 33:04.308
Seriously?
- What?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.308
Ugh.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.531
- Whoa, whoa!
Why are you speeding up?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.369
- I'm not!

33:20.499 --> 33:22.035
Bobby is.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.703
- Relax, Bobby.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.744
You're having a nightmare.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.212
- Slow down!

33:29.341 --> 33:31.297
- I'm not controlling the car!

33:31.426 --> 33:35.010
- Maybe if we're in his dream,
he can see us.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.344
- Okay, maybe.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.088
Why?
What are you thinking?

33:38.225 --> 33:39.089
- Hey, kiddo!

33:39.226 --> 33:40.386
- Are you talking to me?

33:40.519 --> 33:43.977
- No, I'm talking
to Bobby, honey.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.561
Bobby, it's Mommy.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.067
Bet you're pumped to get home
to your projects, huh?

33:48.193 --> 33:49.729
I'm sure it's great.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.694
Oh, wait. I have to tell
your dad something.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.360
Okay, here, it's coming up.
Twin Pines Overlook.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.907
- No!
- Bobby! Bobby, please!

34:01.039 --> 34:04.031
- No, stop! Go back!
- Just wake up!

34:05.085 --> 34:06.621
- Bobby.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.540
It can be different this time.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.288
You can change things.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.257
You can save us this time,
Bobby.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.546
I know you can.

34:22.852 --> 34:25.559
I know you can, Bobby.
I trust you.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.775
- Dad, don't play
with the radio.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.361
Dad, don't play
with the radio!

34:35.490 --> 34:36.400
- Nathan.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.364
- No, Dad,
don't touch the radio!

34:38.493 --> 34:40.108
Watch the road, please!

34:41.538 --> 34:44.530
- Okay, Bobby.
I'm watching the road.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.281
[tires squealing]

34:46.418 --> 34:49.455
[all screaming]

35:01.766 --> 35:04.223
[both breathing heavily]

35:04.352 --> 35:07.219
- Whoa!

35:07.355 --> 35:08.640
Whoa.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.684
- You did it, Bobby.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.559
You saved us.
Thank you.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.151
- There you go.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.488
It's okay, Bobby.
I'm here.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.970
Bobby, stop dawdling,

35:47.103 --> 35:49.435
or we won't make the cabin
by nightfall.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.939
- He's a different kind of kid,
Hannah.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.688
- Just like you were.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.360
- Like I was.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.860
- Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

36:04.996 --> 36:07.078
- Have you told Bobby
why the rev

36:07.207 --> 36:08.413
won't let him stay
at his house?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.406
- Honestly,
I don't know how to tell him.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.704
He always tries
to please my father.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.044
That's why he chose butterflies
for his science project.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.506
- You'll tell him
when the time is right.

36:20.345 --> 36:24.884
- Nathan, I'm sorry I let
my father come between us.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.927
- No, it was a long time ago.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.721
- Yeah, it was.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.229
But sometimes
I can't help imagine

36:30.355 --> 36:32.391
what my life might've been like
if! ignored him

36:32.524 --> 36:35.857
and let you take me
away from here.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.646
- We're doing fine here
without you!

36:44.703 --> 36:46.864
Anyway...

36:46.996 --> 36:49.487
yeah, I never knew my parents.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.536
- Do you ever
think about them?

36:53.795 --> 36:56.628
- You know, there were
graduations, proms,

36:56.756 --> 36:58.462
things like that
that they didn't,

36:58.591 --> 37:01.424
you know, show up for.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.590
But in a way,
you're luckier than me.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.089
- Because I knew my parents.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.591
- Yeah.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.390
And because your new family
showed up.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.488
So Dr. Carr
gave me these for you.

37:27.620 --> 37:28.826
- What are these?
- lmipramine.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.195
It stops night terrors.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.071
It should help for now.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.459
- For now.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.668
- The doc says that it tends
not to work on adults.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.629
- Oh.
Well, thank you, Audrey.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.295
- Yeah, so did you talk
to the reverend?

37:42.427 --> 37:45.169
- It's like we're living like
strangers in the same house.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.717
He won't even look at me.
- I'm sorry.

37:47.849 --> 37:50.511
- I saw him at the supermarket,
and he looked the other way,

37:50.643 --> 37:52.929
just kept moving.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.053
But, you know,
his shopping cart

37:55.190 --> 37:57.772
was full of frozen dinners
for one,

37:57.901 --> 38:00.984
and I figure that's bound
to get old, right?

38:01.112 --> 38:04.525
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.972
- Well, we had a flood here
about ten years ago,

38:35.104 --> 38:37.516
so things kind of
got shifted around.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.061
As you can see,

38:40.193 --> 38:41.899
evidence tape's still on there.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.643
It's the original.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.701
- What is this?
A joke?

38:52.831 --> 38:53.741
- Definitely not.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.738
- What about the photographer
who took the picture?

38:55.875 --> 38:57.615
Where's the Colorado Kid buried?

38:57.752 --> 39:00.459
There are still leads
that we could track down.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.204
- It's a very old case,
Agent Parker.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.127
- She might be my mother.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.376
- Well, then stay here
and find her.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.422
- What?

39:08.555 --> 39:09.886
- Why don't you come work
for me?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.596
You know,
you have a very rare talent.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.636
Most people just want
to see things

39:14.769 --> 39:16.100
the way they want
to see 'em,

39:16.229 --> 39:18.561
whereas you see things
the way they are.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.897
That is a skill that I value.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.062
Hell, it's kind of a skill
we desperately need around here.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.571
- Well, that keeps
getting clearer.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.860
- So, you know,
you could actually make

39:28.992 --> 39:30.072
kind of a difference here,

39:30.201 --> 39:32.578
and, more importantly
for you,

39:32.704 --> 39:34.740
I could maybe help you find

39:34.873 --> 39:37.285
some of the answers
that you're looking for...

39:37.417 --> 39:39.282
if you were to stay.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.880
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.730
- Your father
just offered me a job.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.650
- What'd you say?

40:09.782 --> 40:15.243
- I said that I would
think it over.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.613
- Might be a good idea.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.834
- Really?
What makes you say that?

40:27.926 --> 40:31.544
- February 1983.
I was seven.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.341
I went sledding
on that hill right over there.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.465
I crashed into a tree,

40:36.601 --> 40:39.138
but I felt fine,
so I ran back up the hill,

40:39.270 --> 40:40.976
ready to go again,

40:41.105 --> 40:45.565
and Lisa Bottke took
one look at me and threw up.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.904
I had blood all over my coat

40:49.030 --> 40:50.270
and a bone
sticking out of my arm,

40:50.406 --> 40:53.148
and I never felt a thing.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.526
Wasn't the only thing
that happened that year.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.073
Don't remember a lot of it,

40:58.206 --> 41:02.119
just people whispering,
kids pulled out of school.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.626
- The troubles.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.755
- Couple years later,
I got better,

41:09.884 --> 41:12.500
and I stopped hearing
about them.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.681
- And you're afraid
they're coming back?

41:18.810 --> 41:19.970
- No.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.344
They are back.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.563
And I'm afraid
they won't go away this time.

41:31.322 --> 41:35.986
- I might need to stick around
for a while and see.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.861
- You sure you want to do that?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.362
- That crime picture
with that woman

41:40.498 --> 41:43.410
that I think might
be my mother,

41:43.543 --> 41:44.874
that was taken around the time

41:45.003 --> 41:47.540
that you say
the troubles started.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.331
- I think it's all connected.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.386
- I guess we're gonna find out.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.846
You want to grab
something to eat?

42:04.272 --> 42:07.139
- How about pancakes?

42:07.275 --> 42:09.391
- Yeah, I could eat
some pancakes.
