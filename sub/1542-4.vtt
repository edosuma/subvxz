40:40.058 --> 40:41.560
SHE WROTE MOSTLY AT NIGHT,

40:41.560 --> 40:44.152
WITH A GLASS OF WINE,
AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE...

40:44.152 --> 40:46.234
RING STAINS AND --

40:46.234 --> 40:50.829
BUT I THINK HERE
IS WHEN SHE FOUND OUT

40:50.829 --> 40:54.412
SHE WAS PREGNANT
BECAUSE THE WINE STAINS STOP

40:54.412 --> 40:58.416
AND SHE STARTS WRITING DOWN
EVERYTHING SHE ATE.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.999
SO...
THIS WAS WHEN SHE...

41:00.999 --> 41:04.002
REALIZED SHE WAS PREGNANT
WITH YOU.

41:04.002 --> 41:06.755
SO SHE WANTED YOU
TO BE OKAY.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.137
SHE WANTED
TO BE HEALTHY.

41:11.219 --> 41:14.643
SHE TRIED, AT LEAST.

41:17.185 --> 41:20.058
THEY MADE US WHO WE ARE.

Ellis: THE FIRST TIME I WON
THE HARPER AVERY,

41:30.318 --> 41:33.912
I DEDICATED IT TO THE MEN
WHO'D BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE.

41:33.912 --> 41:35.664
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]

41:35.664 --> 41:38.747
[ CHUCKLES ]
NO, I WISH. JUST KIDDING.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.670
THE FIRST TIME I WON
THE HARPER AVERY,

41:41.670 --> 41:44.252
I THOUGHT,
"SCREW ALL THOSE BOYS."

41:44.252 --> 41:45.503
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

41:45.503 --> 41:48.426
I STOOD THERE,
HOLDING THAT TROPHY,

41:48.426 --> 41:52.010
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
EVERYTHING I'D SACRIFICED,

41:52.010 --> 41:54.092
WHAT I HAD OVERCOME.

41:54.092 --> 41:58.266
AND I DEDICATED THAT AWARD

41:58.266 --> 42:02.901
TO ALL THE WOMEN SURGEONS
WHO WOULD COME AFTER ME.

42:02.901 --> 42:04.733
