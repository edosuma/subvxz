00:00.031 --> 00:02.609
- Guess what's back!
<i>- Previously on</i> Stitchers...

00:02.634 --> 00:04.846
You have a sister. Her name's Ivy Brown.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.500
Your mother is still alive.

00:07.525 --> 00:11.668
I shared information with you
that I promised to keep secret.

00:11.693 --> 00:14.560
You are not the only one with
issues at the moment, so back off!

00:14.585 --> 00:16.792
- If something should happen to me...
- Baba!

00:16.817 --> 00:18.227
I've always been proud of you.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.101
You need to make a choice.

00:19.126 --> 00:21.797
The girl in your mind or the
girl standing in front of you.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.094
- What do you want?
- I want to be with my mother.

00:24.119 --> 00:25.668
Shh. He can hear you.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.866
Whoever that is, that's not me.

00:26.891 --> 00:28.691
Entanglement. It's the ultimate hack!

00:28.726 --> 00:30.926
Stinger's been running the
anomaly on us this entire time.

00:30.962 --> 00:32.250
Shut it down, Captain.

00:32.275 --> 00:35.140
- Step away from your equipment.
- Excuse me.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.928
You haven't just crossed a line,
Baptiste. You've crossed me.

00:41.955 --> 00:44.625
- Kirsten's gone.
- Then get her back!

00:44.650 --> 00:46.016
- Mom.
- How do you feel?

00:46.041 --> 00:47.945
- Like I'm home.
- I want you to hijack it.

00:47.970 --> 00:50.328
No matter how long it takes...

00:50.353 --> 00:52.242
I will never leave you.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:13.310 --> 01:14.676
She's ready.

01:14.711 --> 01:17.660
All right, stand by.
Rebooting all systems in 30 seconds.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.613
If this doesn't work,
how much longer can Kirsten last?

01:21.638 --> 01:25.309
She's not eating, but she's getting
fluids. She could last a few weeks.

01:25.334 --> 01:28.128
Yes, what about her mind?
How long can she stay lost inside of it?

01:28.153 --> 01:30.060
- I don't know.
- Well, what does Goodkin think?

01:30.085 --> 01:31.015
He doesn't know either.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.137
He's had three days to figure it out.

01:32.162 --> 01:36.387
This is what he's come up with. Rebooting
the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.255
Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.247
You're all in enough trouble

01:39.272 --> 01:41.274
without also killing the golden goose.

01:41.299 --> 01:44.286
Don't make me regret letting you and
your men out of the interrogation room.

01:44.311 --> 01:46.857
It's a good thing for you that you did.

01:49.599 --> 01:50.698
How's your son?

01:50.723 --> 01:53.457
Recovering in Germany at
the Army Medical Center.

01:53.482 --> 01:55.450
I hope I get to see him
before you send me off

01:55.475 --> 01:57.762
to wherever it is you
plan on sending me off to.

01:57.787 --> 02:00.537
That one's on you, Baptiste.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.285
You ready?

02:04.310 --> 02:05.960
Does it matter?

02:06.850 --> 02:08.917
Cameron, when this is
over, win or lose...

02:08.942 --> 02:11.038
they're gonna disappear us.
You know that right?

02:11.062 --> 02:14.593
When this is over,
if Kirsten's dead, I won't care.

02:17.425 --> 02:20.563
Prepping systems to go offline!

02:26.442 --> 02:28.535
Full system reboot on my mark!

02:28.560 --> 02:31.068
In five... four...

02:31.093 --> 02:32.193
three...

02:32.218 --> 02:33.692
two...

02:33.717 --> 02:35.377
one. Mark!

02:35.402 --> 02:38.122
Full system power down!

02:38.147 --> 02:40.414
Blood pressure's dropping. 107 over 66.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.584
- Not yet.
- 98 over 54.

02:46.955 --> 02:49.055
Not yet.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.106
81 over 44. She's crashing!

02:52.131 --> 02:54.942
- Cameron?
- Not yet.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.167
- She's bottomed.
- Cameron.

02:57.191 --> 02:59.339
- Reboot.
- Systems back online

02:59.364 --> 03:01.364
in three, two, one, now.

03:07.042 --> 03:09.060
Kirsten, can you hear me?

03:11.220 --> 03:13.818
Blood pressure's not coming back up.

03:14.775 --> 03:16.427
Kirsten.

03:18.204 --> 03:20.075
Kirsten!

03:37.200 --> 03:41.918
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:44.535 --> 03:46.477
Kirsten.

03:49.458 --> 03:52.153
- Ayo.
- Wait.

03:52.178 --> 03:54.660
93 over 62. It's coming back up.

03:54.685 --> 03:55.458
Kirsten, come on.

03:55.872 --> 03:58.106
Come on, talk to me, Stretch. Linus!

03:58.131 --> 04:00.497
She's still trapped in the memory loop.

04:00.747 --> 04:02.254
Damn it.

04:02.623 --> 04:05.454
Goodkin, is that it?

04:19.928 --> 04:22.015
I have to find out how
my father is doing.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.749
I talked to Blair about letting
you call out. He won't budge.

04:24.774 --> 04:26.640
- I bet I could make him budge.
- Linus.

04:26.665 --> 04:27.831
I'm going crazy!

04:28.966 --> 04:30.591
I can feel it.

04:30.784 --> 04:32.684
There's something not right with him,

04:32.709 --> 04:34.709
and... I don't know how to explain it,

04:34.734 --> 04:37.277
but I just... I just know.

04:37.302 --> 04:40.067
The bond between parent
and child is like that.

04:40.092 --> 04:42.825
It's... I guess it's like entanglement.

04:47.149 --> 04:48.841
The conference room! Tell everyone!

04:48.865 --> 04:51.032
Please.

04:51.778 --> 04:53.917
Quantum disentanglement?

04:53.942 --> 04:55.785
Yeah! So, what do we know?

04:55.810 --> 04:59.248
Our quantum computer's entangled
with Stinger's quantum computer.

04:59.273 --> 05:01.417
They are bonded without
being physically connected,

05:01.442 --> 05:03.746
like the bond between a
child and their parent.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.972
Now, if we could just figure
out how to disentangle them,

05:05.997 --> 05:07.964
then we could take back full
control of Kirsten's Stitch.

05:07.989 --> 05:09.021
Yeah, but we've been through this.

05:09.046 --> 05:11.012
We don't know where
Stinger moved his computer.

05:11.037 --> 05:14.148
It doesn't matter! It could be a
mile away, a hundred miles away.

05:14.173 --> 05:15.448
It could be in the next room!

05:15.481 --> 05:18.216
Entanglement is not
dependent on proximity.

05:18.241 --> 05:20.029
What we need to figure
out is the trigger

05:20.054 --> 05:22.146
Stinger used to entangle Kirsten.

05:22.171 --> 05:23.974
Linus is right.
We don't need to know where he is.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.065
We need to know how he did it.

05:25.090 --> 05:26.997
How do we do that without Stinger?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.072
His daughter, Ivy.
I think she knows something.

05:29.097 --> 05:31.060
No. We already questioned her.

05:31.085 --> 05:33.118
We even hooked her up to a polygraph.
She doesn't know anything.

05:33.143 --> 05:35.740
Well, maybe you geniuses didn't
ask her the right questions.

05:35.765 --> 05:37.296
Where's Fisher?

05:37.321 --> 05:40.107
Under guard in the interrogation room.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.196
He was not being cooperative.

05:42.221 --> 05:44.608
- Get him.
- Nope! He's dangerous.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.792
Get him.
He was there when Ivy was questioned.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.230
He'll know what happened.

05:48.255 --> 05:51.156
Or we can just stand around and
watch your golden goose die.

05:51.205 --> 05:53.138
And that will be on you.

06:03.841 --> 06:07.520
- God, Fisher!
- Quincy, what happened?

06:07.545 --> 06:10.317
I wasn't being... cooperative.

06:10.974 --> 06:13.548
- Are you all right?
- You should see the other guy.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.273
I'm serious. Are you all right?

06:15.298 --> 06:17.711
I'm serious. You should
see the other guy.

06:20.724 --> 06:22.340
Get the handcuffs off of him!

06:22.365 --> 06:24.365
No, no. Can't risk that.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.361
I promise I won't break
anymore of your guards.

06:28.084 --> 06:29.507
My God, I cannot wait until I'm done

06:29.532 --> 06:31.298
with the whole lot of ya. All right.

06:31.323 --> 06:33.441
When Ivy was questioned,
did anyone ask her

06:33.466 --> 06:35.813
exactly how Stinger trapped Kirsten?

06:36.016 --> 06:38.762
No. It was "Where's your father?"
and "Where's his computer?"

06:38.787 --> 06:39.899
Nothing about his methods.

06:39.924 --> 06:41.988
Let's get her in here.
Ask the right questions.

06:42.013 --> 06:44.785
Linus, you handle this.
Find out what she knows.

06:44.810 --> 06:46.310
Gladly.

06:47.732 --> 06:50.666
I don't know where my father is.

06:50.691 --> 06:53.465
I told you. I told everyone!

06:53.490 --> 06:55.590
I don't care about that!

06:55.615 --> 06:58.684
What I want to know is how he
manipulated his quantum computer

06:58.709 --> 07:00.842
to trigger entanglement in ours.

07:00.866 --> 07:02.271
What's a quantum computer?

07:02.296 --> 07:03.689
Would you stop playing me?

07:03.714 --> 07:04.713
What is your problem?!

07:04.749 --> 07:07.115
My problem is that I
am in a situation here!

07:07.140 --> 07:09.406
And the sooner I can
find out how your father

07:09.431 --> 07:11.264
triggered entanglement in our computer,

07:11.289 --> 07:13.809
the sooner I can find out how
the hell my father's doing.

07:14.479 --> 07:15.978
What's wrong with him?

07:17.405 --> 07:19.439
He had surgery a couple days ago.

07:19.464 --> 07:22.359
And since we're in lock-down,
I have no idea how he's doing.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.907
- Can't you call?
- No!

07:25.169 --> 07:28.365
Outgoing calls are restricted
and they took away my cell phone.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.853
NSA goons took mine away
when they brought me in too,

07:31.878 --> 07:34.121
except they forgot this.

07:35.607 --> 07:37.677
It has a cellular connection.

07:42.494 --> 07:45.715
Use it. Call.

07:46.751 --> 07:48.291
Find out.

07:49.479 --> 07:51.643
And yes...

07:51.668 --> 07:53.907
I know what quantum computers are,

07:53.932 --> 07:55.470
and how entanglement triggers work.

07:55.495 --> 07:58.979
Now, what is this really all about?

08:00.515 --> 08:01.950
Kirsten.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.216
It's about Kirsten.

08:05.304 --> 08:07.128
Do you think we can trust Ivy?

08:07.153 --> 08:08.634
I'm not a hundred percent sure,

08:08.659 --> 08:09.588
but at the end of the day,

08:09.613 --> 08:11.783
that is her sister dying in there.

08:12.227 --> 08:14.845
Hijacking the hijacked
signal does make sense.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.456
You've already done
that. It didn't work.

08:16.481 --> 08:19.159
Not hijacking the anomaly's signal.

08:19.184 --> 08:20.637
Hijacking Kirsten's mother.

08:20.662 --> 08:22.329
That's not a signal. That's a memory.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.659
Well, it's the same thing, sort of.

08:23.684 --> 08:26.218
Kirsten's emotional state is what's
keeping the entanglement active.

08:26.243 --> 08:28.971
If we can isolate Kirsten's
memory of Jacqueline Stinger,

08:28.996 --> 08:30.095
we can manipulate it.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.087
Force a disentanglement
trigger to make her bounce.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.313
So, you're gonna save Kirsten

08:33.339 --> 08:35.940
with an idea you got from the
daughter of the guy who trapped her.

08:35.965 --> 08:37.441
Do you want Kirsten out of here or not?

08:37.466 --> 08:39.645
Because this gamble's
all the gamble I got.

08:52.579 --> 08:54.219
Hey.

08:55.408 --> 08:56.940
Tell me.

08:59.156 --> 09:00.755
He died.

09:02.463 --> 09:04.612
Two... two days ago.

09:05.904 --> 09:08.033
The funeral was yesterday.

09:10.093 --> 09:12.072
I wasn't even there.

09:14.102 --> 09:16.313
How's your mom?

09:17.629 --> 09:18.995
She's holding up.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.610
Did you tell her...

09:20.635 --> 09:22.922
why you haven't been able to call?

09:23.452 --> 09:25.672
I wanted to, but she stopped me.

09:25.697 --> 09:27.627
She said it doesn't matter.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.292
Whatever I was doing was important,

09:29.317 --> 09:31.117
and that my father would have approved.

09:33.213 --> 09:35.784
I loved him so much.

09:37.605 --> 09:40.621
I know. Come on.

09:41.598 --> 09:44.167
Okay. Stations, everyone.

09:45.163 --> 09:47.326
Technically, this
Stitch is still active,

09:47.352 --> 09:49.185
so there's no go-no-go to call.

09:49.229 --> 09:53.011
Linus and Camille, I'll need
you both to isolate the memory.

09:55.535 --> 09:57.168
Linus, you okay?

09:57.203 --> 09:59.099
He's good.

10:00.551 --> 10:03.687
Okay. Let's go get our girl.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.366
Isolate the signal and
route it to my station

10:06.391 --> 10:08.196
in three, two, one.

10:08.221 --> 10:10.610
- Mark!
- Done.

10:11.012 --> 10:14.239
Got it. Kirsten?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.787
- Kirsten?
- Mom.

10:23.308 --> 10:27.110
Hi, honey. I think it's...

10:27.135 --> 10:28.388
time for you to go now.

10:30.569 --> 10:32.169
I'm not leaving.

10:32.194 --> 10:34.640
This is no place for you. If you...

10:34.665 --> 10:36.157
stay here, you will die.

10:36.182 --> 10:37.425
I don't care.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.514
I want to be with you forever.

10:39.952 --> 10:42.226
Entanglement is holding.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.194
Say it.

10:56.338 --> 10:58.992
Well, I don't want to be with you.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.702
You don't mean that.

11:02.587 --> 11:03.867
Yes, I do.

11:03.892 --> 11:05.415
Now, leave.

11:07.483 --> 11:09.183
Heart rate's up to 103.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.360
Entanglement is weakening.

11:10.385 --> 11:12.952
Is there any way you can diminish
everything except the mother memory?

11:12.977 --> 11:14.611
Give me ten seconds.

11:14.636 --> 11:15.836
Mom?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.772
You don't mean that.

11:20.003 --> 11:21.695
What have you ever done for me?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.438
Entanglement is down to 50 percent.

11:23.463 --> 11:26.264
I am cutting background impulses now!

11:26.289 --> 11:28.222
I tried to save you.

11:28.247 --> 11:29.092
Save me?

11:30.789 --> 11:32.192
Save me?

11:32.217 --> 11:34.263
You're the reason my
life is the way it is.

11:34.288 --> 11:36.633
Mom. Please, what are you saying?

11:36.658 --> 11:38.280
Heart rate: 137.

11:38.305 --> 11:39.913
- Really push her.
- What do you think I'm doing?

11:39.938 --> 11:41.201
Push her harder.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.202
Here, take this.

11:43.227 --> 11:45.127
I was happy before you
came into my life...

11:45.152 --> 11:46.319
do you know that?

11:46.344 --> 11:49.362
I had my work, my life...

11:49.387 --> 11:51.537
and then you ruined everything!

11:51.562 --> 11:53.817
That's not true. You
don't feel that way.

11:53.842 --> 11:54.908
You can't feel that way!

11:54.943 --> 11:56.476
Twenty-three percent.

11:56.512 --> 11:58.436
I do, Kirsten. That's
exactly how I feel.

11:58.461 --> 12:00.233
Please, Mom, don't say that.

12:00.258 --> 12:01.209
It's the truth.

12:01.234 --> 12:03.429
No, you love me! I know you do.

12:03.454 --> 12:04.486
You're wrong.

12:04.511 --> 12:06.186
But I love you.

12:06.211 --> 12:08.178
I don't care.

12:08.203 --> 12:09.662
Now leave me alone!

12:09.687 --> 12:11.731
- Mom, please.
- Nine percent.

12:11.756 --> 12:13.541
I don't want to be with you.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.466
- Leave!
- No!

12:15.491 --> 12:17.487
- Leave!
- Mom!

12:17.512 --> 12:20.365
- Go, damn it!
- Mom!

12:20.719 --> 12:21.783
Kirsten.

12:23.144 --> 12:25.812
You can't help me if
you're stuck in here.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.258
Mom?

12:27.283 --> 12:28.916
Get out of my life!

12:28.941 --> 12:31.389
- Mom!
- I don't love you!

12:31.414 --> 12:33.747
- Mom!
- Zero percent. We're disentangled.

12:33.772 --> 12:35.396
Mom!

12:38.147 --> 12:39.506
Mom!

13:01.070 --> 13:02.998
Kirsten. Kirsten. Shh.

13:03.023 --> 13:05.281
It's okay. That wasn't her.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.044
No. She said things.

13:08.069 --> 13:10.366
No, no. No, that...
That wasn't her, okay?

13:10.391 --> 13:11.944
That was me. I said those things.

13:11.969 --> 13:13.460
That...

13:13.798 --> 13:15.545
What?

13:21.420 --> 13:23.220
That was you?

13:24.315 --> 13:27.116
Talking through my
mother the whole time?

13:27.141 --> 13:30.560
It was the only way
to get you to bounce.

13:37.832 --> 13:40.287
Kirsten.

13:45.695 --> 13:47.628
Arrest them all.

13:48.419 --> 13:50.182
What?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.772
Hey! Slow down.

14:18.518 --> 14:20.318
How long?

14:20.343 --> 14:21.637
You asleep?

14:21.662 --> 14:24.447
Closin' in on 18 hours.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.509
- Cameron.
- He saved you.

14:28.082 --> 14:30.412
Why are you here? I...

14:30.444 --> 14:31.998
I thought you hated me.

14:32.023 --> 14:33.999
Yeah.

14:34.099 --> 14:36.876
Uh... about that.

14:38.137 --> 14:40.437
I was just mad at you, but...

14:40.630 --> 14:42.756
feels like a pretty long time ago.

14:43.942 --> 14:45.333
Where is Cameron?

14:45.368 --> 14:46.601
Where's Camille?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.303
You know the unctuous guy?

14:48.338 --> 14:50.480
At the NSA,
the one who looks like a sci-fi villain?

14:50.505 --> 14:53.059
- Blair.
- He arrested everyone.

14:53.428 --> 14:56.495
So, you know about the
Stitchers technology.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.597
Yes, and I know my father.

14:59.622 --> 15:01.755
Our father helped build it.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.624
He trapped me inside my own memory.

15:03.659 --> 15:06.239
He's not my father, not anymore.

15:10.130 --> 15:12.358
So where did Blair take everyone?

15:12.426 --> 15:13.948
I don't know.

15:13.973 --> 15:17.942
When you bounced, they ushered
me out of the interrogation room.

15:18.165 --> 15:20.099
How many guards are
sitting outside right now?

15:20.134 --> 15:22.167
None. Blair said you
weren't going anywhere.

15:23.371 --> 15:24.974
Well, he's wrong.

15:37.485 --> 15:40.552
Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.

15:40.577 --> 15:43.965
Thought you'd have bodyguards to
protect you against rogue agents.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.691
- Budget cuts.
- Mmm.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.742
I am surprised to see you back on
your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.033
My sister helped me.

15:51.058 --> 15:54.294
Ah! The sister you're
a fool for trusting.

15:54.319 --> 15:56.873
- That sister?
- Where's my team?

15:57.740 --> 15:58.990
Your small, erratic team

15:59.015 --> 16:01.558
of warrior-scientist
friends are being detained.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.847
- Pending relocation.
- Relocation?

16:03.872 --> 16:05.824
What's that code for? Execution?

16:05.849 --> 16:08.051
Don't be a child, Miss Clark.

16:08.505 --> 16:09.571
Now, please, if you'll excuse me,

16:09.606 --> 16:12.507
I need to prepare for my
meeting with Admiral Decker.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.575
He's my boss.

16:13.610 --> 16:16.377
Everyone answers to a higher authority,
Miss Clark.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.313
What about my team?

16:18.348 --> 16:21.830
I am preparing a new,
more trustworthy team for you,

16:21.855 --> 16:24.756
so the work of the Stitchers
Program will continue.

16:24.781 --> 16:26.736
No, it won't, not without me.

16:27.510 --> 16:29.060
Seriously?

16:29.096 --> 16:31.325
This again?

16:32.099 --> 16:37.163
All right. Come with me.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.204
I would've thought you'd be
ready for a change in your team,

16:42.229 --> 16:45.923
considering how Goodkin used
your mother's memory against you.

16:45.948 --> 16:47.502
Well, it worked, didn't it?
It got me to bounce.

16:47.527 --> 16:50.394
Well, but at what cost? Hmm?

16:50.419 --> 16:53.054
How will you remember your mother now?

16:53.079 --> 16:56.281
How will you react to her
when you are reunited?

16:56.306 --> 16:58.643
Yeah. Reunited.

16:58.961 --> 17:01.561
- You know where she is.
- I do.

17:01.597 --> 17:02.503
Someplace safe.

17:02.528 --> 17:04.395
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.777
Trust me, the NSA needs her hale
and hearty as badly as you do.

17:11.380 --> 17:12.479
Please.

17:15.585 --> 17:17.890
The lab accident that
happened to your mother,

17:17.915 --> 17:19.705
the one when you were eight years old,

17:19.731 --> 17:21.742
do you have any idea
what she was working on?

17:21.768 --> 17:23.648
- Project Grasshopper.
- Yeah, that's the name.

17:23.674 --> 17:26.328
But its purpose? No?

17:26.557 --> 17:28.690
Well, Project Grasshopper's goal

17:28.726 --> 17:31.175
was to accelerate the
evolution of the human brain.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.167
You can't speed up evolution.

17:33.192 --> 17:34.636
Yes, you can.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.106
Why would anyone want to?

17:38.142 --> 17:41.309
Well,
imagine if world leaders knew instantly

17:41.345 --> 17:43.178
what other world leaders
felt and thought?

17:43.213 --> 17:46.148
If they could immediately
intuit the wants, needs,

17:46.183 --> 17:48.438
fears, desires of their counterparts.

17:48.463 --> 17:51.397
You tell me. What would that mean?

17:52.629 --> 17:57.035
- The end of conflict?
- Yes. The end of war.

17:57.060 --> 17:59.213
Hunger, poverty,
pretty much all the bad stuff

17:59.238 --> 18:01.372
that keeps nice people,
like me, up at night.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.475
Project Grasshopper was a failure.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.210
Ah!

18:08.245 --> 18:10.049
That depends on who you ask.

18:10.969 --> 18:13.526
The lab accident accelerated
your mother's brain.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.764
She evolved in ways more
complex than we understand.

18:16.789 --> 18:18.689
We tried to recreate it, and we failed,

18:18.724 --> 18:21.558
and that is why we need
to keep your mother safe.

18:21.594 --> 18:24.461
So that after Stitching
technology is perfected,

18:24.497 --> 18:28.274
we can Stitch into her
living, evolved brain

18:28.299 --> 18:29.777
and map it completely,

18:29.802 --> 18:31.027
every neuron,

18:31.052 --> 18:33.848
until we understand her completely.

18:33.873 --> 18:37.200
We're saving the world, Miss Clark.

18:38.546 --> 18:41.447
- Our cases are training missions?
- Yes!

18:41.472 --> 18:42.823
Designed to teach us everything

18:42.848 --> 18:44.382
there is to know about Stitching.

18:44.407 --> 18:47.293
And when we are done...
When we are done...

18:47.318 --> 18:49.239
you get to complete the rescue mission

18:49.264 --> 18:51.562
you started with your
father all those years ago

18:51.587 --> 18:54.552
and finally pull your mother
out of her endless sleep.

18:54.577 --> 18:58.012
Oh, suddenly, I'm not
such a bad guy, am I?

18:58.037 --> 18:59.348
Your mother's alive and well.

18:59.373 --> 19:01.057
One day, you'll be reunited with her,

19:01.082 --> 19:02.375
but not if you quit the program.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.134
- I can't do it without my team!
- Yes, you can!

19:05.159 --> 19:07.581
They're very, very smart people, sure,

19:07.606 --> 19:08.940
but they are just people.

19:08.965 --> 19:10.731
You will stay with the program

19:10.756 --> 19:13.611
if you want to save
your mother, Miss Clark.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.606
You sure it's okay for me to be here?

19:21.631 --> 19:24.038
I stopped caring what's
okay about an hour ago.

19:25.006 --> 19:27.106
Who's there?

19:27.131 --> 19:28.911
Jesus. Tim!

19:28.936 --> 19:31.379
- Who's the skirt?
- Who's the ape?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.824
That's Tim.

19:32.849 --> 19:35.365
He works here in Engineering.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.662
God, what happened to your hair?

19:36.687 --> 19:39.443
I cut it.
I figured I'm going to prison, why wait?

19:39.468 --> 19:40.591
Why aren't you detained?

19:40.616 --> 19:41.926
I am.

19:41.959 --> 19:44.659
I need to 3D print some
spare parts for the new team

19:44.695 --> 19:46.019
before I get shipped off.

19:46.044 --> 19:48.115
I hope it's some place
nice like Cleveland.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.296
Mmm.

19:49.766 --> 19:52.068
Are you sure Blair has
no idea Linus has it?

19:52.093 --> 19:53.067
Positive.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.485
If Linus is half as
smart as I think he is,

19:55.510 --> 19:56.709
he found a way to keep it on him.

19:56.734 --> 19:58.156
Question.

19:58.181 --> 20:00.199
What are we talking about?

20:03.253 --> 20:04.737
There it is.

20:04.762 --> 20:07.332
I lent Linus my smart-watch.

20:07.357 --> 20:09.290
He still has it.

20:09.315 --> 20:11.336
This is gonna be harder than I wanted.

20:11.361 --> 20:13.421
That's an NSA facility.

20:14.454 --> 20:17.188
Biometrics, photo ID.

20:17.213 --> 20:19.135
- It's impossible.
- Mmm.

20:19.406 --> 20:20.819
Well, that's what people say

20:20.844 --> 20:22.344
about hacking into the
memories of the dead.

20:22.369 --> 20:24.432
No, that sounds reasonable.

20:25.637 --> 20:27.504
You know how I'm gonna
get them out of there?

20:27.529 --> 20:29.187
Through the front door.

20:30.452 --> 20:32.308
Nora Dublin, 42 years old.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.533
Highest ranking woman in
the NSA security hierarchy.

20:34.737 --> 20:36.802
Got the promotion from
the President himself.

20:36.827 --> 20:38.447
Holds the rank of Security Commander.

20:38.472 --> 20:41.101
Currently stationed in Cairo.

20:42.963 --> 20:45.286
You look good for 42.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.628
It's clean living.

20:49.545 --> 20:51.612
What about the biometrics?

20:51.647 --> 20:54.796
You don't happen to have Nora
Dublin's fingers lying around, do you?

20:55.168 --> 20:57.131
I'm about to.

21:02.619 --> 21:05.515
I hope this will fool
the biometrics scanner.

21:07.051 --> 21:09.640
I've never printed anything
this thin and flexible.

21:09.665 --> 21:11.465
I have no idea how long it will last.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.606
Hopefully long enough.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.682
- Good evening.
- Ma'am.

21:38.794 --> 21:40.594
Commander Dublin.

21:40.629 --> 21:42.109
From the Cairo office?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.067
- Yes.
- What brings you to LA?

21:44.103 --> 21:46.310
I'm here to oversee a prisoner transfer

21:46.335 --> 21:48.641
from Detention Block AA-23.

21:48.859 --> 21:51.352
We don't have detention blocks.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.610
Well, in Cairo, that's what we
call where the prisoners are held.

21:55.635 --> 21:58.776
If you call it something different here,
that's your business, not mine.

22:06.207 --> 22:07.773
It's good.

22:08.091 --> 22:10.004
- Thank you.
- Hold it, Commander.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.373
I need to call this in
because that's my business.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.614
Director Mitchell Blair's office.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.407
Yes, this is Post 1477E16.

22:22.432 --> 22:25.136
Calling in for confirmation
of a prisoner transfer.

22:25.161 --> 22:27.847
Stand by for Director Blair.

22:29.322 --> 22:31.364
This is Blair.

22:31.389 --> 22:34.094
Yes, I'm at Post 1477E16.

22:34.119 --> 22:38.575
Is this about the prisoner transfer
from Detention Block AA-23?

22:38.950 --> 22:41.214
- Yes, sir.
- I concur.

22:41.239 --> 22:43.883
- Concur?
- Approve?

22:43.908 --> 22:46.741
She's good. Good to go. It's all good.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.467
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.

22:49.492 --> 22:51.745
Will do, sir. Sorry to bother you.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.140
Sorry for the delay, Commander.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.236
- Director Blair sends his regards.
- That's so Director Blair.

22:58.261 --> 23:00.065
Place your right hand on the scanner,
please.

23:16.670 --> 23:19.544
Commander,
may I see your credentia one more time?

23:22.186 --> 23:24.887
When was the last time you
had this scanner cleaned? Hmm?

23:24.912 --> 23:26.645
Ma'am?

23:39.040 --> 23:42.464
In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.

23:42.499 --> 23:46.392
- Commander, let me escort you.
- That would be lovely.

23:51.103 --> 23:52.741
Here we are, the, uh...

23:52.776 --> 23:54.609
detention blocks.

23:54.644 --> 23:56.018
Thank you.

23:56.938 --> 23:59.558
- I'll take it from here.
- Are you sure?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.961
These prisoners attacked
a fully-armed NSA unit.

24:01.986 --> 24:03.359
I can take care of myself.

24:03.384 --> 24:07.154
- I'll wait outside. Just in case.
- Mm-hmm.

24:09.509 --> 24:11.188
You got to be freakin' kidding me!

24:11.213 --> 24:13.619
Well, look who finally showed up.

24:13.644 --> 24:15.744
Told you!

24:16.877 --> 24:18.677
Kirsten, what the hell
are you doing here?

24:18.712 --> 24:20.001
Getting you out?

24:20.653 --> 24:22.376
Please tell me you're not cooking.

24:22.401 --> 24:23.930
Yeah, crepes. You want?

24:23.955 --> 24:26.589
I thought you guys were in trouble.
It's like a country club!

24:26.625 --> 24:29.009
We're being reassigned,
not waterboarded.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.922
Okay, well, Blair plans to
continue with the program.

24:32.947 --> 24:34.252
I told him I wouldn't do it without you.

24:34.277 --> 24:35.825
Let me guess. He didn't care?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.712
He... he said my mother's still alive,

24:37.737 --> 24:40.915
and that as soon as we perfect
Stitching, I'll be able to save her.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.781
- He told you all of that?
- That sounds a little crazy.

24:43.806 --> 24:45.973
At least he didn't screw
with my memory of her.

24:46.065 --> 24:48.070
I will explain it when we're outta here.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.189
All right, so what's the plan?

24:49.214 --> 24:51.647
Something that doesn't involve
us getting shot on the way out?

24:51.672 --> 24:53.539
No, I worked up a security clearance,

24:53.564 --> 24:54.805
told the guards I'm
taking charge of you.

24:54.830 --> 24:58.248
It's a prisoner transfer
from Detention Block AA-23.

24:58.273 --> 25:00.063
- Mmm! That's my girl!
- <i>Blade Runner?</i>

25:00.088 --> 25:01.190
- <i>Star Wars.</i>
- Darn.

25:01.214 --> 25:02.668
We're gonna walk out of here together,

25:02.693 --> 25:03.916
then we're gonna find my mother,

25:03.941 --> 25:06.033
and we're gonna use that
knowledge as leverage.

25:06.058 --> 25:08.206
Force Blair to let you all
continue with the program.

25:08.231 --> 25:10.965
NSA protocol is that prisoner transfers

25:10.990 --> 25:12.884
require at least one armed guard.

25:12.909 --> 25:14.842
I don't suppose you're carrying a gun.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.307
You said we couldn't.

25:16.332 --> 25:18.252
Your idea, not mine.

25:18.277 --> 25:21.020
Only one armed guard? Done!

25:32.552 --> 25:35.159
Ivy told me about your dad.

25:35.290 --> 25:38.663
Linus, I'm so sorry. He was a good man.

25:38.688 --> 25:42.041
Yeah. He was the best. Thanks.

25:44.095 --> 25:45.544
Hey.

25:45.679 --> 25:48.125
- Can we talk about the Stitch?
- I'd rather not.

25:48.150 --> 25:50.320
Look, I'm sorry about what I
did to get you to bounce, but...

25:50.345 --> 25:52.078
It's not that I'm not grateful,

25:52.113 --> 25:54.113
it's just now I'm stuck
remembering my mother that way.

25:54.148 --> 25:55.533
She wasn't real.

25:56.584 --> 25:59.225
She was to me.

26:35.085 --> 26:37.108
Thank you for your cooperation.

26:43.004 --> 26:46.605
- Freeze! Stay where you are!
- Right there!

26:49.150 --> 26:52.542
Guess crepes are back on the menu.

27:06.187 --> 27:08.108
We've had plenty of time to check.

27:08.133 --> 27:09.499
There's no other way out.

27:09.829 --> 27:13.497
Well, maybe you missed something.

27:13.522 --> 27:15.843
Then again, maybe we didn't.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.702
- You'll be fine.
- I'm worried about everyone else.

27:18.727 --> 27:20.560
Well, we'll be fine too.

27:20.585 --> 27:23.749
I've always wanted to spend more
time in an Arctic weather station.

27:23.774 --> 27:25.531
Joking. I...

27:25.556 --> 27:27.886
I have no idea where
Blair's reassigning me.

27:27.911 --> 27:29.336
Why don't you just quit?

27:29.361 --> 27:31.528
- You could go back to research.
- What?!

27:31.572 --> 27:33.826
And give up show business? Nah.

27:33.851 --> 27:36.320
Maybe if I play nice,
and don't piss anyone off for a while,

27:36.345 --> 27:38.250
Blair will let me back
in the Stitch lab, but...

27:38.275 --> 27:39.832
Why would you even want to?

27:39.857 --> 27:41.786
Because that's where you'll be.

27:41.992 --> 27:43.820
Okay, you need to keep Stitching.

27:43.845 --> 27:45.540
- Not without you.
- Yes, without me!

27:45.566 --> 27:47.532
It's the only hope your mother has.

27:47.557 --> 27:49.657
Look, look, as long
as I know you're safe,

27:49.682 --> 27:51.716
I'll be okay, and...

27:51.741 --> 27:55.749
You know, I am... I am sorry about
what I did to your memory of her,

27:55.774 --> 27:56.973
but that's why you
need to keep Stitching,

27:56.998 --> 28:00.054
so you can save your mother
and make some new memories.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.980
We're needed back at the lab.
Something's happened.

28:14.702 --> 28:16.693
They showed up about a half hour ago.

28:16.718 --> 28:18.197
What is she doing here?

28:18.222 --> 28:19.955
She helped me rescue you guys.

28:19.980 --> 28:22.366
So, this is what rescued looks like?

28:22.391 --> 28:25.148
Oh, hi, Mitch. Great to see you again.

28:25.173 --> 28:26.956
Not now, Engelson.

28:27.489 --> 28:29.041
New case has come in.

28:29.066 --> 28:30.709
27 years old.

28:30.734 --> 28:32.546
Hit and run...

28:32.571 --> 28:35.755
while jogging downtown.
His name is Nathan Blair.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.008
He's my son.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.761
Mitchell, I am so sorry.

28:40.786 --> 28:43.687
I need to know who did this
and if it was premeditated.

28:43.712 --> 28:46.279
Maybe someone killed Nathan to
get to me. I need to know who.

28:46.315 --> 28:48.936
Mitchell,
I don't think that this is good for you.

28:51.722 --> 28:53.399
He was my son.

28:54.126 --> 28:55.401
Okay.

28:56.036 --> 28:57.736
No.

29:02.499 --> 29:05.995
Kirsten, come with me.

29:10.478 --> 29:12.245
We have him where we want him.

29:12.270 --> 29:13.919
Negotiate, get pardons.

29:13.944 --> 29:15.393
Make him tell us where my mother is.

29:15.418 --> 29:18.319
"We have him where we want him?"
Is that who you are?

29:18.344 --> 29:19.800
That is his son in there.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.340
Yeah, and I didn't see him
crying over the people I lost.

29:22.365 --> 29:24.122
Me neither.

29:24.147 --> 29:25.866
That man kept me from finding out

29:25.891 --> 29:28.051
that my father had died for three days.

29:28.076 --> 29:30.370
I didn't even get to go to my own
father's funeral because of Blair.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.787
I'm not doing jack for him.

29:31.812 --> 29:35.043
And that is why you two
are better than he is.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.575
- I'm not so sure about that.
- I am.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.559
Go suit up.

29:50.970 --> 29:53.009
Hey! Look, I don't
know how ready you are

29:53.034 --> 29:54.368
to Stitch so soon after...

29:54.393 --> 29:57.547
you know, but first time something
goes wrong, I want you to bounce, okay?

29:57.579 --> 29:58.040
Mm-hmm.

29:58.065 --> 30:00.939
I almost lost you once.
I'm not doing that again.

30:02.502 --> 30:04.428
Hey.

30:04.453 --> 30:06.889
You're cute when you're
worried about me.

30:06.914 --> 30:09.933
Then I must be cute all the time.

30:11.056 --> 30:13.022
All right, lights at 20 percent, please.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.080
I need a go-no-go for Stitch neuro-sync.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.204
- Life Sci?
- Go.

30:17.228 --> 30:18.181
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.

30:18.206 --> 30:19.820
- Engineering?
- Go.

30:19.845 --> 30:20.994
- Communications?
- Go!

30:21.019 --> 30:22.402
- Medical.
- We are a go.

30:22.427 --> 30:23.665
Comm check. One, two, one, two.

30:23.690 --> 30:24.760
I hear you, Cameron.

30:24.785 --> 30:26.982
All right, mission clock
set to five minutes, please.

30:27.236 --> 30:29.903
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
this one's family.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.410
So, let's get it right.

30:31.435 --> 30:33.111
Induce Stitch neuro-sync on my mark.

30:33.136 --> 30:34.667
In three...

30:34.692 --> 30:36.043
two...

30:36.068 --> 30:38.035
one...

30:38.060 --> 30:40.545
mark.

30:43.165 --> 30:45.165
_

30:45.655 --> 30:47.516
"All that night, we
were in a great bustle"

30:48.114 --> 30:49.570
"getting things in their place...

30:49.595 --> 30:51.228
"boatfuls of the squire's friends,

30:51.253 --> 30:52.887
- "squire's friends..."
- What do you see, Kirsten?

30:52.912 --> 30:55.508
Nathan's seven years old, maybe, eight.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.415
Blair's reading to him in the office.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.732
<i>Treasure Island.</i>

30:58.757 --> 31:00.362
Blair's being very sweet to him.

31:00.387 --> 31:01.553
He loved that book.

31:01.578 --> 31:03.411
"The boatswain sounded his pipe..."

31:05.072 --> 31:07.533
"and the crew began to
man the capstan-bars.

31:07.558 --> 31:10.996
And the crew began to
man the capstan-bars."

31:15.190 --> 31:16.923
Located a memory hotspot.

31:16.948 --> 31:18.352
- How hot?
- Molten.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.570
All right, K, you're on the move.

31:22.101 --> 31:25.092
You don't even know her!

31:26.781 --> 31:28.476
The NSA knows her family.

31:28.501 --> 31:30.234
She's not her parents.

31:30.269 --> 31:32.236
We are all our parents.

31:32.271 --> 31:34.142
That's who we become.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.981
Blair and Nathan are fighting.
It's about a girl.

31:40.357 --> 31:43.124
You think that she's
using me to get to you?

31:43.149 --> 31:44.358
I can't rule it out.

31:44.383 --> 31:47.188
Everything makes sense
when I'm with her, Dad.

31:47.213 --> 31:49.560
God, sentiment like that is proof
you're not ready to get married,

31:49.585 --> 31:51.452
not just to her, but to anyone.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.062
Do not turn your back on me, young man!

31:54.087 --> 31:55.187
You're wrong!

31:55.212 --> 31:57.227
Not all of us become our parents.

31:57.944 --> 32:01.295
That's the last memory
Nathan had with Blair in it.

32:02.031 --> 32:04.085
That's the last time I saw him alive.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.841
Approaching death memory.

32:13.461 --> 32:15.666
Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.

32:22.823 --> 32:24.439
Blair wants to kill your mother.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.886
Do not trust him.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.167
Find out where she is,
and find a way to tell me.

32:28.192 --> 32:29.964
Together, we can save her.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.267
I'm counting on you, sweetheart.

32:32.292 --> 32:33.972
- Oh my God.
- Kirsten, what is it?

32:33.996 --> 32:35.996
Will you talk to me, damn it?

32:36.021 --> 32:38.207
Cameron. You okay there?

32:39.389 --> 32:41.759
Kirsten, bounce.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.926
And hey, I don't think
you're a bad person

32:43.951 --> 32:45.823
for calling the NSA on me.

32:45.848 --> 32:49.526
Kirsten, Daddy loves you so much.

32:51.848 --> 32:53.511
Death memory in six seconds.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.143
Kirsten, damn it, make the bounce.

33:02.651 --> 33:04.065
Well?

33:05.654 --> 33:07.260
What'd you see?

33:08.752 --> 33:12.074
Don't play with me, Miss Clark.
What'd you see?

33:13.580 --> 33:15.360
- Nothing.
- What'd you see?!

33:15.385 --> 33:16.799
Nothing.

33:19.608 --> 33:22.471
Sidearm. Now.

33:23.658 --> 33:25.624
Blair!

33:25.649 --> 33:27.756
Tell me, or I will shoot her.

33:35.693 --> 33:37.995
Kirsten, don't tell
this ass-hat anything.

33:38.597 --> 33:40.330
Blair, take it easy.

33:40.355 --> 33:42.224
I would stop moving, right now,
Detective, if I were you.

33:42.249 --> 33:45.016
Mitchell, I know you're upset,
but you don't have to do this.

33:45.041 --> 33:47.234
What did you see?

33:54.123 --> 33:55.762
I saw my father kill your son.

33:55.787 --> 33:56.826
What?

33:56.851 --> 33:59.599
He knew you'd make us Stitch,
so he wanted to give me a warning.

33:59.624 --> 34:01.915
He said you're gonna kill my mother.

34:02.670 --> 34:04.397
Why would I kill your mother?

34:04.422 --> 34:06.055
You tell me.

34:07.316 --> 34:09.016
That son of a bitch...

34:10.668 --> 34:12.842
killed my son to tell you that.

34:13.879 --> 34:15.510
I'm gonna find your psychopathic father,

34:15.534 --> 34:17.018
and when I do, I am gonna kill him.

34:17.043 --> 34:18.110
That's my warning.

34:22.815 --> 34:24.502
Touch me again,
and I'll rip out your ribcage

34:24.527 --> 34:26.563
and wear it like a vest.

34:29.496 --> 34:31.195
There are several vans waiting outside.

34:31.219 --> 34:33.155
You'll all be held for reassignment.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.822
All except you, Miss Clark.

34:35.847 --> 34:37.746
What makes you think
I'll keep working here

34:37.782 --> 34:39.675
after you take everyone away from me?

34:39.699 --> 34:43.665
I haven't taken everyone away from you.
Not yet.

35:02.428 --> 35:06.606
He used me to make you stay, didn't he?

35:09.069 --> 35:11.837
You know, this lab...

35:11.872 --> 35:14.973
it used to remind me of everything
that was wrong in my life.

35:15.009 --> 35:17.976
And now it's pretty much
the only place where...

35:18.001 --> 35:19.409
everything's right.

35:19.892 --> 35:21.703
Kirsten...

35:21.728 --> 35:24.706
- I'm so sorry...
- It's not your fault.

35:24.829 --> 35:29.685
And as long as my mom is
out there somewhere, alive,

35:29.710 --> 35:31.213
I'm not done.

35:31.238 --> 35:33.549
What about Blair?

35:34.976 --> 35:36.270
You know, I used to think

35:36.295 --> 35:38.428
I was the smartest person in the room.

35:38.453 --> 35:40.334
But Cameron, Camille, Linus,

35:40.359 --> 35:42.526
even Maggie and Fisher, they're...

35:42.551 --> 35:46.603
they're all so much smarter
than I am in so many ways.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.106
But...

35:51.141 --> 35:54.778
there is one person
that I'm smarter than.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.312
Mitchell Blair.

35:57.347 --> 36:02.244
You got something on him in the Stitch,
didn't you?

36:02.269 --> 36:04.913
Oh, yeah.

36:19.332 --> 36:22.806
Nora Dublin? Credentials, please.

36:37.275 --> 36:40.251
You look younger than I remember,
Miss Dublin.

36:40.487 --> 36:42.454
I apologize, Admiral.

36:42.479 --> 36:44.174
My name is Kirsten Clark,

36:44.199 --> 36:47.392
and I work for a secret
division of the NSA

36:47.417 --> 36:49.791
that hacks into the
memories of the dead.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.836
It's called the Stitchers Program,
but you knew that.

36:54.637 --> 36:58.175
- That's ridiculous.
- You know it's not.

36:59.394 --> 37:01.731
Leave us.

37:05.979 --> 37:07.979
You lured me here by falsely claiming

37:08.015 --> 37:10.384
to be a high-ranking NSA Commander.

37:10.409 --> 37:11.978
I should have you arrested.

37:12.003 --> 37:14.885
I know... but as Secretary of Defense,

37:14.910 --> 37:18.111
I thought you should know
that someone is threatening

37:18.136 --> 37:19.907
to go public about
the Stitchers Program,

37:19.932 --> 37:21.721
as well as your personal knowledge

37:21.746 --> 37:23.080
of the billions of dollars

37:23.105 --> 37:25.174
that have been diverted developing it.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.913
- Who?
- Me.

37:28.783 --> 37:30.852
You know Daniel Stinger,

37:30.877 --> 37:33.377
and you certainly know Mitchell Blair.

37:34.229 --> 37:36.610
That means you know about
the Stitchers Program.

37:36.635 --> 37:38.632
Let's just say for a
moment you're right.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.892
- Why are we here?
- To make a deal.

37:40.917 --> 37:42.219
My colleagues are being reassigned.

37:42.244 --> 37:43.443
I don't want that to happen.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.846
Anything else?

37:44.871 --> 37:47.557
I want Maggie Baptiste to
run the Stitchers Program.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.460
I never want to see
Mitchell Blair again.

37:49.485 --> 37:52.053
Is that it?

37:52.078 --> 37:54.045
No. I'm looking for someone.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.087
And I know you know where she is.

37:56.112 --> 37:58.402
Who are you looking for?

37:58.427 --> 38:02.614
My mother.

38:15.429 --> 38:17.929
Well, I'm not sure what you did.

38:17.954 --> 38:19.478
Not sure if I want to know either,

38:19.503 --> 38:21.215
but well done.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.699
All I can say is that it's good
to have friends in high places.

38:25.709 --> 38:28.342
Speaking of which,
congratulations on your promotion.

38:28.367 --> 38:30.965
Well, just because I've
been offered Blair's job

38:30.990 --> 38:32.395
doesn't mean that I want it.

38:32.420 --> 38:35.027
Sure you do.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.253
May I come in?

38:45.278 --> 38:48.058
Always.

38:50.625 --> 38:55.293
So... Kirsten Clark saves the day again.

38:55.318 --> 38:57.316
- It was a team effort.
- Well.

38:57.341 --> 38:59.426
Is Nina here?

39:00.051 --> 39:01.784
Yeah, about that.

39:06.789 --> 39:09.087
This was waiting for me when I got home.

39:09.926 --> 39:12.198
"Cameron, I waited three days for you.

39:12.223 --> 39:13.353
"Every time I heard a noise in the hall,

39:13.378 --> 39:15.445
"I would go to the door
thinking it was you coming home,

39:15.470 --> 39:16.290
"but it never was.

39:16.315 --> 39:19.115
"I love you,
but I can't wait for you anymore.

39:19.140 --> 39:22.455
Take care of yourself. Love, Nina."

39:23.133 --> 39:24.970
Cameron...

39:25.187 --> 39:26.920
I'm so sorry.

39:26.945 --> 39:28.044
Are you okay?

39:28.069 --> 39:29.384
Yeah.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.892
I mean, I love Nina, but I...

39:31.917 --> 39:34.033
I wasn't in love with her.

39:34.065 --> 39:37.532
Took me a while,
but I think I finally figured that out.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.433
How long would you have waited for me

39:50.458 --> 39:52.724
when I was trapped in my memory?

39:52.749 --> 39:54.726
Forever.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.128
Everything makes sense
when I'm with you.

40:28.399 --> 40:31.096
Wow.

40:33.106 --> 40:35.645
Please tell me that wasn't
caused by residual emotion.

40:35.670 --> 40:36.810
No.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.244
Brand-new emotion.

40:39.269 --> 40:42.274
- I like it.
- Me too.

40:55.087 --> 40:58.623
Hey. I was wondering...

41:00.760 --> 41:04.021
when... when you were
trying to get me to bounce,

41:04.046 --> 41:06.089
from my memory...

41:06.114 --> 41:08.848
what did you mean when you said,

41:08.873 --> 41:10.969
I couldn't help you if
I was stuck in there?

41:12.006 --> 41:14.306
I never said that.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.085
But if you didn't say it, who did?
