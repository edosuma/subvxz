Cruella:
Psst! Over here.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.540
Now listen, I want you two

01:16.540 --> 01:18.380
to take care of
this little package.

01:18.380 --> 01:21.210
Um, "take care"

01:21.210 --> 01:23.120
What's in the box,
a hamster?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.330
Just hide it
or get rid of it somehow.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.710
Normally, I'd say we could,
but we don't have time.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.210
Time?

01:29.210 --> 01:31.120
You just do as I say.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.750
Mm-hmm.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.540
-Ow!
-Now don't dawdle.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.040
I'm meeting the editor
from the town's most
prestigious magazine,

01:38.040 --> 01:39.790
The Gruteley Do-Gooder.

01:39.790 --> 01:42.120
If I can show him
what a truly caring

01:42.120 --> 01:45.330
and generous person I am,
the magazine will name me,

01:45.330 --> 01:48.580
Cruella De Vil,
Humanitarian of the Year.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, but I
still don't get it.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.290
Ow!

01:54.500 --> 01:57.000
Remember, if anyone
finds this box,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.250
I'll squash you like a bug.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.460
Nanny:
And then she said,

02:03.460 --> 02:06.290
"That would be fine,
bad, greedy lady,

02:06.290 --> 02:10.250
but all we have left is pie!"

02:13.080 --> 02:16.080
Hey, look, Rolly,
there he is!

02:20.380 --> 02:23.210
If we can show that editor
from The Gruteley Do-Gooder

02:23.210 --> 02:25.790
how truly caring
and generous Nanny is,

02:25.790 --> 02:30.830
the magazine will name her
Humanitarian of the Year.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.710
"Humanitarian of the Year."

02:36.710 --> 02:38.790
That'd be great.
Truly deserves it.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.040
And then she said,

02:41.040 --> 02:43.830
"You'll never take our farm,
but have another pie!"

02:43.830 --> 02:45.170
Ta-da!

02:45.170 --> 02:48.460
-The end!

02:48.460 --> 02:49.580
Oh, thank you.

02:49.580 --> 02:52.250
Thank you,
thank you, thank you...

02:52.250 --> 02:54.120
Editor:
Oh, that was just beautiful!

02:54.120 --> 02:56.380
Oh...

02:58.920 --> 03:03.080
What's this?

03:03.080 --> 03:05.000
Good morning, neighbor.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.170
Have a muffin.

03:06.170 --> 03:07.880
Have a muffin, child.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.040
I baked it myself.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.120
Good morning, neighbor.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.920
Here's a nice,
warm muffin for you.

03:16.710 --> 03:17.880
You're welcome.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.500
-Oh, Mr. Gubble!

03:20.500 --> 03:22.580
-How nice to meet you.

03:22.580 --> 03:23.710
Gah--

03:23.710 --> 03:26.380
Oh no, Nanny has competition!

03:26.380 --> 03:27.830
Yeah, right.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.830
Cruella De Vil,
Humanitarian of the Year?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.420
-Cadpig: Yeah.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.040
I think you may
have crossed the road

03:36.040 --> 03:38.080
one too many times,
my friend.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.040
B-- b-- but look!
She's with the editor

03:40.040 --> 03:41.960
from The Gruteley Do-Gooder.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.620
-I'm delivering food
to the less fortunate.
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.080
-Oh, there's some now!

03:48.080 --> 03:49.460
Shall we?

03:49.460 --> 03:51.290
Cruella:
Oh, Anita...

03:51.290 --> 03:54.120
-Roadwork...

03:54.120 --> 03:55.920
how have you two
been holding up?

03:55.920 --> 03:59.580
-Um--
-Here, have some muffins.

03:59.580 --> 04:02.120
Now, now, I insist.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.290
After all, you need
your nourishment.

04:05.290 --> 04:08.710
They're a proud people,
but they'd be the first ones

04:08.710 --> 04:12.290
-Uh-huh.
-to tell you I definitely should
be Humanitarian of the Year.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.920
Well, uh, before
I make my decision,

04:14.920 --> 04:17.670
I'd like to find out
a little bit more about you.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.960
Ask me anything.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.790
My life is an open book.

04:21.790 --> 04:25.670
I have absolutely
nothing to hide.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.040
So where we gonna hide this?

04:29.170 --> 04:31.000
Just dump it in here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.290
-Okay.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.790
Haha.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.380
No one will ever find it now.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.830
Uh...

04:38.830 --> 04:42.210
Here, I think
you dropped this.

04:50.170 --> 04:53.080
Ha. No one will
ever find it now.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.250
-Never.
-Both: Aah!

04:56.250 --> 04:59.420
Here, I think you dropped this.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.920
Ha. No one will
ever find it now.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.920
Both:
Huh?

05:19.120 --> 05:22.040
Here, I think you dropped this.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.750
Jasper, where'd you go?

05:25.750 --> 05:27.880
-Right over here, you dummy!
-Ooh!

05:36.500 --> 05:38.120
Jasper:
There.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.080
Ha. No one will
ever find it now.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.290
Spot, calm down.

05:53.290 --> 05:57.330
There's no way
Cruella could ever win
Humanitarian of the Year.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.250
Bok, bok, bok,
but what if Cruella lies

05:59.250 --> 06:02.000
and convinces
that magazine editor
that she should win?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.920
You saw the muffin mobile.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.170
We gotta do something!

06:05.170 --> 06:08.960
Well, unless we find a box
of incriminating photographs

06:08.960 --> 06:11.380
that prove every
un-humanitarian thing

06:11.380 --> 06:13.040
Cruella's ever done--

06:13.040 --> 06:14.500
-Hey, look what I found!

06:14.500 --> 06:18.210
Lucky:
"Incriminating photos
of Cruella De Vil."

06:18.210 --> 06:20.210
Now that's what I call lucky!

06:20.210 --> 06:23.420
So, this is where you live.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.920
It's humble, I know,

06:25.920 --> 06:27.420
but I call it home.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.040
Why, you're neighbors
with the Dearlys.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.170
Who are like family to me.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.000
-Oh, yes.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
We're just sugar-borrowing,
fence-chatting, coffee-klatching

06:37.000 --> 06:40.960
neighbors sharing love,
good times, and mutual respect.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.170
Whoa, here's
a picture of Cruella

06:46.170 --> 06:48.830
trying to cheat Roger
and Anita out of their farm!

06:51.420 --> 06:53.120
I want to buy the place.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.620
That moth-eaten Widow Smedley
wouldn't sell it to me.

06:56.620 --> 06:59.120
But you will. Why?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.000
Because Anita,
you work for me

07:02.000 --> 07:03.920
and you want to please me.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.420
So, I'm prepared
to offer you...

07:06.420 --> 07:08.330
double what you paid!

07:08.330 --> 07:10.750
Sorry, Cruella, but
your money's no good here.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.000
-Triple it.
-Nope.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.250
-Quadri-triple it.
-No can do.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.210
What do you want, Rudolph?

07:16.210 --> 07:18.040
Name your price.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.880
It's not for sale.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.000
This farm now belongs to us
and the dalmatians.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.830
The dalmatians.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.540
Yes.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.750
Tell me, are there still 101,
or did I manage to take out

07:31.750 --> 07:33.920
a couple of the mutts
when I drove in?

07:37.880 --> 07:40.920
Well, if you change
your minds, let me know!

07:40.920 --> 07:43.460
Meanwhile, I hope you all
enjoy your little...

07:43.460 --> 07:45.540
Barkingham Palace.

07:50.290 --> 07:53.920
Memo to myself: come up
with a diabolical scheme

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
to steal this farm.

07:57.420 --> 08:00.620
Cadpig:
That wasn't very humanitarian.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.880
Hey, look at this one!
I remember that day.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
$1,582.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.960
Why, that's the exact amount

08:07.960 --> 08:10.920
of Reggie and Anita's
monthly mortgage payment.

08:10.920 --> 08:15.710
Hm, I suppose I should
return it to Anita.

08:15.710 --> 08:19.960
Then again, finders keepers,
losers weepers!

08:26.250 --> 08:28.540
Rolly:
Huh, that was a close one.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.790
Cadpig:
Hey, here's one with her
humanitarian pet, Scorch.

08:31.790 --> 08:35.210
Spot:
Ooh, things were
looking bad that day.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.290
-I do believe

08:37.290 --> 08:40.790
the cost of my boots wiped out
the Dearlys' checking account!

08:40.790 --> 08:43.750
Just one pair!

08:47.830 --> 08:51.210
Imagine if the Dearlys had to
replace my entire collection!

08:51.210 --> 08:53.710
Well, they'd be driven
to the poorhouse!

08:53.710 --> 08:55.710
-That's it!

08:55.710 --> 08:59.080
If I could lure that shoebie,
spotted pup here,

08:59.080 --> 09:01.120
he would chew every shoe!

09:01.120 --> 09:03.960
The Dearlys could
never pay me back!

09:03.960 --> 09:06.500
They'd have to
give me their farm!

09:06.500 --> 09:09.120
Cadpig:
Instead, we gave her the boot!

09:09.120 --> 09:11.000
Spot:
Fashion that, Cruella.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.880
Oh, take a look
at this one!

09:16.880 --> 09:19.420
Cadpig:
Talk about negative energy.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.500
Cruellanator:
I am the Cruellanator.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.830
Nothing can stop me.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.330
My secret weapon...

09:27.330 --> 09:29.170
Must attain more wealth

09:29.170 --> 09:31.880
starting with the Dearly Farm.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.880
You know, I love
the Dearlys to pieces.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.500
Why, I gave Rustproof's little
video game business its start.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.830
And I must say, my caring
and generous nature

09:42.830 --> 09:45.000
is an inspiration to him.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.710
Ooh!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.330
Hmm.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.750
-Cadpig and Rolly: Look out!

10:01.750 --> 10:03.750
Take a look at me.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.120
A good, hard look!

10:08.120 --> 10:11.250
Rolly:
What a model citizen.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.830
Spot:
Hey, here's one of Anita.

10:12.830 --> 10:15.000
I remember this.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.540
Hmm...

10:26.540 --> 10:27.670
-Ow!

10:27.670 --> 10:30.290
Anita:
Okay, okay,
I'll be right there.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.670
Hello? Roger!

10:35.670 --> 10:37.960
You got the stuff? Great!

10:37.960 --> 10:40.080
No, no, no,
I'm on my lunch break,

10:40.080 --> 10:42.750
-so it's my time,
not Cruella's.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.580
Listen, I'll pick up
the other things after work.

10:44.580 --> 10:47.670
I gotta get back
to my designs now
for you-know-what.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.620
Bye. Muah!

10:55.620 --> 10:57.750
-Woman: Will Anita Dearly

10:57.750 --> 11:00.290
- come to the front
desk immediately.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.040
-Will Anita Dearly please

11:08.040 --> 11:10.920
pull chair from under desk,
then come to front desk.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.170
Get to work.

11:22.710 --> 11:25.750
-Hm.
-Poor Anita's career
was on the skids

11:25.750 --> 11:28.710
until I hired her
at the House of DeVil.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.620
-Well, my dear...

11:32.620 --> 11:34.670
are we being
brilliant as usual?

11:34.670 --> 11:38.210
Yes, I can see we are.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.380
You know, I can
never thank you enough

11:40.380 --> 11:41.620
for letting me
work here, Cruella.

11:41.620 --> 11:44.120
No, my dear,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.670
you can't, can you?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.960
Answer, it, Anita.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.750
It may be that wonderfully
dim husband of yours.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.500
Hello?

11:54.500 --> 11:57.000
Why, yes, Mr. Puffin.
This is--

11:57.000 --> 11:59.620
Hello, Puffin, darling!

11:59.620 --> 12:01.960
Isn't it me
you want to speak to?

12:01.960 --> 12:04.170
Er, why, yes, Cruella.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.080
I knew it!

12:06.080 --> 12:09.620
Listen, before I make
the public announcement,

12:09.620 --> 12:12.250
I wanted to congratulate
you for having

12:12.250 --> 12:15.000
the Designer of the Year
working for you.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.460
Darling,
I don't work for me,

12:18.460 --> 12:20.290
I am me.

12:20.290 --> 12:23.580
Oh, Cruella,
you are such a caution.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.960
No, darling.
Not you at all.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.290
Anita's the new
Designer of the Year!

12:30.580 --> 12:33.120
Cruella, are you all right?

12:34.460 --> 12:37.790
Of course, Anita, dear.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.710
I'm just so full of emotion,

12:40.710 --> 12:44.120
I can barely express
my feelings.

12:45.750 --> 12:50.540
Yes,
working for me has been
a dream come true for Anita.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.120
Anita:
"Fired"?

12:52.120 --> 12:55.620
Not fired, downsized.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.080
All the big companies
are doing it.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.920
It's so in this year!

12:58.920 --> 13:00.420
So, you're out.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.790
But I thought
you liked my work.

13:04.790 --> 13:07.210
Oh, I do. You're the best.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.750
But if I downsize
an employee as good as you,

13:09.750 --> 13:11.750
imagine how good
the competition will think

13:11.750 --> 13:13.920
my other employees are.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.380
Cadpig:
Cruella sure can be mean.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.120
I know. Poor Anita.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.380
Spot:
Hey, the Chief Firedog Contest.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.000
Cruella was
in rare form that day.

13:27.580 --> 13:30.120
Cruella:
"Chief Firedog Contest"?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.790
"This Saturday
at the Dearly Farm,

13:31.790 --> 13:35.250
sponsor your favorite puppy
with a donation to the
Grutely Fire Department"?

13:35.250 --> 13:37.960
Oh, do you know
what this means?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.580
Balloons and ice cream

13:39.580 --> 13:42.500
and cute, little,
happy puppies.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.670
-D'oh!
-No!

13:44.670 --> 13:46.960
It means I'll lose a fortune.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.580
For years, I've been
trying to drive

13:48.580 --> 13:50.670
the Grutely volunteers
out of business

13:50.670 --> 13:52.960
so I could debut
my new product:

13:52.960 --> 13:55.580
the DeVil Dime-A-Drip
Fire Hydrant!

13:55.580 --> 13:57.500
It looks like
a fire hydrant,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.620
but it works
like a parking meter!

13:59.620 --> 14:01.420
Just drop in
your change up here,

14:01.420 --> 14:05.000
and a carefully regulated
ration of water spills out here.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.670
Because with Cruella De Vil,
a drop in my bucket

14:08.670 --> 14:11.080
means a drop
in your bucket.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.750
What civic pride.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.330
Talk about pride.
Remember this?

14:16.330 --> 14:19.120
Cadpig:
Oh, the caring,
giving Cruella.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.170
I am Cruella De Vil!

14:22.170 --> 14:25.620
My name is synonymous
with wealth!

14:25.620 --> 14:28.330
But your fall designs fell flat.

14:28.330 --> 14:31.880
Especially these cheese shoes.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.250
Our only seller was
the Cruella De Vil
Halloween costume.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.250
And according
to my computations,

14:37.250 --> 14:39.000
profits are down.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.120
Down? Well, of course.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.330
It's quite clear to me
my profits are less... up

14:44.330 --> 14:45.670
than they should be.

14:45.670 --> 14:50.790
Well, that's easily remedied,
isn't it, Scorch?

14:50.790 --> 14:52.960
You're fired!

14:57.790 --> 14:59.540
Mm-hmm.

14:59.540 --> 15:03.710
Ms. De Vil, I have to say,
it's very refreshing

15:03.710 --> 15:07.380
to find a wealthy person
with such a generous spirit.

15:09.290 --> 15:11.420
Hey, look at this!

15:11.420 --> 15:14.290
There is one thing
Cruella loves more than money:

15:14.290 --> 15:18.290
her own reflection!

15:20.500 --> 15:21.830
Oh.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.580
Oh, if only there was
a quick fix

15:26.580 --> 15:29.790
for my fading bloom of youth.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.790
Why should I,
of all people,

15:32.790 --> 15:34.830
have to age? Ow!

15:37.790 --> 15:39.670
There must be a way.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.250
Oh-- Oh.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.380
Aah! Oh!

16:11.380 --> 16:12.790
My eyelash!

16:16.540 --> 16:19.290
Why do they call it
"super

16:19.290 --> 16:23.290
Is there nothing that can
make me young again? Ugh.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.380
I'd like to take a picture
of you, Ms. De Vil.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.380
If you win Humanitarian
of the Year,

16:31.380 --> 16:33.290
you'll be on the cover
of our magazine.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.830
Oh, really?

16:35.830 --> 16:38.880
Are you ready, or would you like
to powder your nose first?

16:38.880 --> 16:42.290
Well, I don't know
about the other candidates

16:42.290 --> 16:46.080
you photographed,
but I don't have
a vain bone in my body.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.380
-Ew!
-Gross!

16:48.380 --> 16:49.960
-That's the time

16:49.960 --> 16:51.580
she wanted to find
the Fountain of Youth

16:51.580 --> 16:53.170
by stealing all our water.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.460
Look at me.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.500
I'm gorgeous anyway.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.000
Oh, why, I don't need youth.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.380
I just need better lighting.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.460
Muah.

17:10.170 --> 17:13.290
Oh my. You're quite
a natural, Ms. De Vil.

17:14.580 --> 17:17.040
-Ugh!

17:17.040 --> 17:19.670
Oh, you're an animal lover too.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.460
Uh, of course!

17:21.460 --> 17:23.380
I adore animals.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.710
Wake up, chicken!

17:26.710 --> 17:28.540
Huh

17:28.540 --> 17:31.960
48, 49, 50, 51?

17:31.960 --> 17:36.000
Oh, only 51 completed paintings,
and the opening is tonight!

17:36.000 --> 17:39.040
I need 49 paintings
by eight o'clock, bird,

17:39.040 --> 17:42.170
or one deep,
fat fryer. Got it?

17:46.330 --> 17:47.250
Hm.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.620
Well, well...

17:51.620 --> 17:53.960
looks like
three little dalmatians

17:53.960 --> 17:56.170
have lost their way.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.380
Run!

18:15.250 --> 18:17.710
-Gotcha! Wha--

18:18.960 --> 18:20.250
Gone.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.250
Lucky:
Boy, this was a close call.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.420
It's amazing,

18:28.420 --> 18:30.420
with everything
she's got to do,

18:30.420 --> 18:32.620
she still finds time
to torment us.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.580
Hey, look.
This was the time

18:34.580 --> 18:37.420
we got a chance
to torment her.

18:39.170 --> 18:40.250
Ahh.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.250
Oh, isn't that sweet?

18:42.250 --> 18:44.750
My bed is filled with puppy dogs

18:44.750 --> 18:48.380
licking and crawling
all over me.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.120
Germs! Disease!

18:51.120 --> 18:53.120
Fleas!

18:58.750 --> 19:01.380
Tell me a little
about your family, Ms. De Vil.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.670
Well, no.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.670
The truth of the matter is,

19:07.670 --> 19:09.500
I'm too busy
doing good deeds

19:09.500 --> 19:11.620
to even think about men.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.250
-Look!
-Ew!

19:14.250 --> 19:17.000
-Oh, just another example

19:17.000 --> 19:19.380
of Cruella's
man-ster behavior.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.960
I'm telling you, Cru,

19:21.960 --> 19:23.670
I just don't feel
that way about ya.

19:23.670 --> 19:24.750
Mm.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.120
-Oh!

19:26.120 --> 19:27.380
You're my business rival.

19:27.380 --> 19:30.330
It would be unethical
for me to like you. Aah! Ooh!

19:30.330 --> 19:32.000
Oh, fess up.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.420
Ralphie, darling,
who else can it be?

19:35.420 --> 19:37.080
I'm a lot of things, Cru,

19:37.080 --> 19:39.040
but I'm not as dumb
as I look. Whoa!

19:39.040 --> 19:41.460
Oh, you're right.

19:41.460 --> 19:44.210
Anyone who wears
such gauche undergarments

19:44.210 --> 19:48.080
doesn't have the taste
to appreciate a prize like me.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.330
Welcome,
Baron Von Schnickerdoodle!

20:00.670 --> 20:02.080
Can I get you anything?

20:02.080 --> 20:04.120
A drink

20:04.120 --> 20:05.500
Oxygen?

20:05.500 --> 20:08.580
Memo to myself:
make this a short engagement.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.380
Ooh! Hello, sailor!

20:17.380 --> 20:19.040
What do you say
you and I find

20:19.040 --> 20:22.210
a little island
to get stranded on

20:22.210 --> 20:25.790
Okay, boys,
just leave my essentials
with half-pint here.

20:30.170 --> 20:33.880
And I'll be back
after this three-hour tour.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.080
Oh!

20:40.080 --> 20:42.960
Lucky:
And that was certainly
a photo opportunity.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.920
-Okay, okay, we all know

20:44.920 --> 20:48.290
Cruella's a self-serving,
money-grubbing animal hater.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.880
Now let's get
these photographs
to that editor guy

20:50.880 --> 20:54.120
before he names her
Humanitarian of the Year!

21:00.080 --> 21:02.540
Quick! Before she comes out!

21:06.330 --> 21:08.580
Editor:
Well, thank you
so much, Ms. De Vil,

21:08.580 --> 21:10.830
for that lovely tea
and showing me around

21:10.830 --> 21:12.080
your wonderful home.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.000
Well, I'm so glad
you could drop by.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.920
And I don't mind saying
you have a very good chance

21:17.920 --> 21:20.040
of becoming
Humanitarian of the Year.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.080
well, that would be
quite an honor,

21:23.080 --> 21:26.380
but I always say
just doing for others

21:26.380 --> 21:28.830
-is reward enough for me.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.790
Adieu , Ms. De Vil.

21:32.710 --> 21:35.420
So, uh, you think
he'll find the photos?

21:40.580 --> 21:42.580
He found 'em.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.000
What?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.080
No!

21:55.920 --> 21:57.880
I don't know what
she's so angry about.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.500
The magazine gave her
quite an honor.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.670
It did?

22:00.670 --> 22:02.080
She made number one

22:02.080 --> 22:05.080
on Gruteley's Top 10
Worst Dressed list.
