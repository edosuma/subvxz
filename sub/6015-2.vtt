00:03.972 --> 00:06.611
Good evening. Welcome to the show.
The extra buttons.

00:08.292 --> 00:09.964
Yeah.

00:11.532 --> 00:14.604
What kind of a sicko, really,
would save these...

00:14.772 --> 00:17.206
...have them in a huge file?

00:17.372 --> 00:20.364
Drawers that wide.
You know, you just...

00:22.172 --> 00:23.321
"Where the hell is that but..."

00:23.492 --> 00:27.565
I mean, is it that hard to get
black, round buttons...

00:27.732 --> 00:29.529
...that they make it
into a whole thing?

00:29.692 --> 00:31.250
Like this is such a great jacket.

00:31.412 --> 00:35.405
These buttons are so unique,
so one-of-a-kind.

00:35.572 --> 00:37.881
You'll never find them.
We'll save you the trouble...

00:38.052 --> 00:41.089
...of knocking your brains out.
We know they're going to fall off too.

00:41.252 --> 00:43.812
That's the other point that
they're trying to make here.

00:49.772 --> 00:51.410
Everyone in my family's creative.

00:51.572 --> 00:54.689
And even though I'm working
as an accountant right now...

00:54.852 --> 00:58.083
...l'd really like to eventually
work exclusively...

00:58.252 --> 01:00.447
...on my papier-mâché hats.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.362
I don't understand.
Papier-mâché hats?

01:09.372 --> 01:10.805
What if it rains?

01:12.772 --> 01:14.967
They're art.
You hang them on the wall.

01:15.412 --> 01:16.606
Art.

01:17.292 --> 01:20.125
It's my creative outlet,
one of my passions.

01:20.292 --> 01:21.566
Any money in it?

01:22.532 --> 01:24.807
"Who so belongs only to his age...

01:24.972 --> 01:28.601
...reverences only its popinjays
and mumbo jumbos."

01:29.692 --> 01:31.808
Of course. Right.

01:32.132 --> 01:35.488
- Thomas Carlyle, 1864.
- Tommy C.

01:41.092 --> 01:42.684
These are the receipts from '85.

01:43.012 --> 01:45.082
- And I'm gonna do '86.
- I'm sorry.

01:45.252 --> 01:48.722
I thought it was a legitimate charity.
I didn't know you'd get audited.

01:48.892 --> 01:51.087
I don't blame you. I blame myself.

01:51.252 --> 01:53.482
- No, blame me.
- Okay, I blame you.

01:53.652 --> 01:56.041
- No, no, don't blame me.
- What was I supposed to do?

01:56.212 --> 01:57.770
I was on my first date with Elaine.

01:57.932 --> 02:00.446
You come barging in here,
asking me to contribute money...

02:00.612 --> 02:03.172
...to a volcano relief fund
for Krakatoa.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.845
It was supposed to erupt.

02:05.012 --> 02:06.650
I find the whole thing embarrassing.

02:06.812 --> 02:08.803
Well, you know what
my feelings are about this.

02:08.972 --> 02:10.166
I don't even pay taxes.

02:10.332 --> 02:12.562
Yeah. That's easy when
you have no income.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.603
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:16.772 --> 02:20.048
Kramer, do me a favour, will you?

02:20.212 --> 02:23.010
If you insist on making pasta
in my apartment...

02:23.492 --> 02:27.280
...please don't put the tomato sauce
on the pasta while it's in the strainer.

02:27.452 --> 02:31.889
All the little squares have
hardened red sauce in them.

02:32.892 --> 02:34.689
What's so funny?

02:34.852 --> 02:38.049
Oh, I don't know. Kramer dating
your roommate, it's funny.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.044
It's a riot, Alice.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.845
When do you put the sauce on?

02:43.012 --> 02:44.570
Any other time.

02:45.052 --> 02:48.362
No, no, no. I like to strain the sauce.

02:48.732 --> 02:52.122
And I could really live without...

02:52.292 --> 02:56.763
...the tribal music and the make-out
sessions in the living room.

02:57.932 --> 02:59.331
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

03:04.612 --> 03:07.922
- What are you doing? What is all this?
- Oh, he's helping me sort my receipts.

03:08.092 --> 03:09.491
I'm being audited.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.802
You're being audited? What for?

03:11.972 --> 03:15.203
Oh, I contributed money to a charity
that turned out to be fraudulent.

03:15.372 --> 03:18.364
- It's really very boring.
- When was this?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.762
A long, long time ago...

03:20.932 --> 03:23.969
...in a galaxy far, far away.

03:24.172 --> 03:29.200
I remember you donated to some
volcano thing on our first date.

03:29.412 --> 03:31.642
Volcano? Really?

03:32.092 --> 03:34.652
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me that that was...

03:34.812 --> 03:36.564
Something to drink?

03:36.732 --> 03:38.529
What, did you think
that would impress me?

03:38.692 --> 03:39.966
You've got me all wrong.

03:40.332 --> 03:43.290
I was thinking only
of the poor Krakatoan.

03:43.452 --> 03:45.408
Like you'd make this donation
for 50 bucks...

03:45.572 --> 03:47.403
...and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

03:47.572 --> 03:50.166
Those brave Krakatoans...

03:50.932 --> 03:52.968
...east of Java...

03:53.132 --> 03:56.204
...who sacrificed so much,
for so long.

03:56.372 --> 03:58.010
Now you're being audited
because of it.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.402
- See, that's karma.
- No, that's Kramer.

04:04.492 --> 04:07.689
- So, what are you gonna do?
- It's all taken care of.

04:07.852 --> 04:09.080
How is that?

04:10.172 --> 04:12.606
An old friend of mine,
whom you may have met...

04:12.772 --> 04:15.332
...George Costanza,
has recently become intimate...

04:15.492 --> 04:17.846
...with a female accountant
who was formerly...

04:18.012 --> 04:20.446
...a highly placed official
with a little outfit...

04:20.612 --> 04:23.570
...known as the IRS.

04:23.732 --> 04:26.644
And as we speak,
at this very moment...

04:27.172 --> 04:31.085
...he is handing over to her
all of my pertinent tax information...

04:31.372 --> 04:33.408
...and she has assured us...

04:33.732 --> 04:37.805
...that the matter is well within
her field of expertise.

04:39.252 --> 04:40.446
Why is she doing this?

04:40.612 --> 04:42.523
I don't know. It must be love.

04:43.172 --> 04:45.163
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

04:46.532 --> 04:48.284
You're great...

04:48.612 --> 04:51.410
...but I'm riddled
with personal problems.

04:51.572 --> 04:53.802
- What's wrong? What did I do?
- Nothing. It's not you.

04:53.972 --> 04:57.760
It's me. I have a fear of commitment.

04:57.932 --> 05:00.730
- I don't know how to love.
- You hate my earrings, don't you?

05:01.412 --> 05:02.925
- No, no.
- And you didn't comment...

05:03.092 --> 05:04.286
...on the chopsticks.

05:04.452 --> 05:08.525
I love the chopsticks. I personally
prefer a fork, but they look very nice.

05:10.292 --> 05:13.011
You're not telling me the truth.
I must have done something.

05:14.012 --> 05:16.526
- I have a fear of intimacy. l...
- Don't give me clichés.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.330
I have a right to know.
What did I do?

05:18.492 --> 05:19.766
Nothing. It's not you.

05:19.932 --> 05:21.285
I want the truth!

05:21.452 --> 05:24.444
The truth? You want the truth?!

05:24.612 --> 05:26.204
It is your earrings!

05:26.372 --> 05:27.691
It is your chopsticks.

05:27.852 --> 05:30.366
But it's so much more.
You're pretentious.

05:30.812 --> 05:32.689
You call everyone by their full name.

05:32.852 --> 05:35.241
You called my doorman Sammy,
"Samuel."

05:35.412 --> 05:39.007
But you didn't even say Samuel.
You went "Samuel."

05:39.172 --> 05:40.764
Papier-mâché?

05:40.932 --> 05:43.287
What is papier-mâché?

05:44.612 --> 05:45.806
Keep going.

05:46.452 --> 05:49.205
I think I made my point.

05:50.612 --> 05:52.250
I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.288
No. I asked for the truth.

05:55.972 --> 05:57.724
Thank you for being so honest.

05:58.852 --> 06:00.285
Can I...?

06:00.452 --> 06:04.161
- Can I walk you back to work?
- I really prefer to go alone.

06:05.772 --> 06:07.000
How much do I owe?

06:07.172 --> 06:08.571
Oh, please.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.642
Four dollars is fine.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.887
If this audit had happened to me and
I didn't have this woman to help me...

06:16.052 --> 06:19.601
...I would've killed this man. I would've
strangled him with my bare hands.

06:19.772 --> 06:21.728
- I don't blame you.
- Ever been through an audit?

06:21.892 --> 06:23.484
- No.
- It's hell.

06:23.652 --> 06:27.008
It's the financial equivalent
of a complete rectal examination.

06:27.172 --> 06:28.844
I would've killed this man.

06:29.012 --> 06:30.411
Torn him limb from limb.

06:30.572 --> 06:33.609
Ripped the flesh right off his bones.

06:36.132 --> 06:37.406
- Yeah?
- It's George.

06:37.572 --> 06:38.846
Come on up.

06:39.652 --> 06:42.166
There he is, the man himself...

06:42.332 --> 06:44.129
...George Louis Costanza.

06:44.292 --> 06:46.522
Here I am, about to go
to the electric chair...

06:46.692 --> 06:49.252
...and my oldest friend
is dating the governor.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.365
My whole life has been
a complete waste of time.

06:54.692 --> 06:56.125
And there's so much more to go.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.965
Now I know what I'm supposed
to do. It is so simple.

06:59.132 --> 07:02.841
Tell the truth. That's all.
Just tell the truth.

07:03.012 --> 07:05.207
- You give her my tax papers?
- What?

07:05.372 --> 07:07.124
My papers?

07:08.652 --> 07:09.880
What?

07:10.052 --> 07:11.804
Oh, the papers.

07:12.252 --> 07:14.482
- You didn't give her the papers?
- No, I did.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.290
So?

07:18.332 --> 07:20.209
I broke up with her.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:29.092 --> 07:31.162
- You what?
- I broke up with her.

07:31.332 --> 07:32.765
I'm being audited...

07:32.932 --> 07:35.492
...and you broke up with her?
- It's okay. It's fine.

07:35.652 --> 07:39.361
- She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
- Why? Why will she still do it?

07:39.532 --> 07:42.683
She hates you now. People don't
do you favours after you dump them.

07:42.852 --> 07:44.365
No, no. We left on good terms.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.363
How is that possible?

07:46.532 --> 07:49.842
Because l...
I told her the truth.

07:50.132 --> 07:52.248
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

07:52.412 --> 07:54.528
- It's unheard of.
- She asked me to.

07:54.692 --> 07:55.920
So you lie.

07:56.092 --> 07:59.448
- What did you tell her?
- I told her that she was pretentious.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.965
Pretentious?

08:01.132 --> 08:04.602
The woman has my tax papers.
You told her she's pretentious?

08:04.772 --> 08:06.171
The IRS...

08:06.332 --> 08:08.607
...they're like the Mafia.
They take anything they want.

08:08.772 --> 08:11.081
How would you like it if
someone told you the truth?

08:11.252 --> 08:13.846
- What? What could they say?
- There are plenty of things to say.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.321
Like what? I'm bald?
What is it specifically?

08:16.492 --> 08:18.528
Is there an odour I'm not aware of?

08:18.852 --> 08:20.763
- George, please.
- Give me one.

08:21.132 --> 08:23.202
- You sure?
- Yes.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.885
Okay.

08:26.652 --> 08:29.007
You're extremely...

08:29.452 --> 08:31.124
...careful with money.

08:32.932 --> 08:34.284
I'm what?

08:34.452 --> 08:36.522
- Forget it.
- I'm cheap? You think I'm cheap?!

08:36.692 --> 08:39.081
How could you say that to me?
I can't believe this!

08:39.251 --> 08:41.561
- How could you say that to me?
- You asked me to.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.609
- You should've lied.
- So should you!

08:43.772 --> 08:45.842
Okay, wait a second.
What happened to my papers?

08:46.012 --> 08:48.526
- I'm not really working right now.
- I know.

08:48.692 --> 08:51.490
When I was working, I spent, baby!

08:53.412 --> 08:56.006
Yeah, I know.
Champagne, limos, cigars.

08:56.172 --> 08:57.685
What happened to the papers?

08:57.852 --> 09:00.207
She put them in her pocketbook.
I guess she took them.

09:00.372 --> 09:04.365
- A pocketbook or a handbag?
- Is that relevant? She took them.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.803
Call her office.

09:06.972 --> 09:08.405
Give me the phone.

09:15.492 --> 09:18.165
Yeah, hi, I'd like to speak to Patrice.

09:18.852 --> 09:20.410
What?

09:21.252 --> 09:23.129
Oh, really.

09:23.372 --> 09:25.840
Oh, okay. Thank you.

09:27.412 --> 09:29.289
What? What?

09:30.212 --> 09:31.964
She never came back from lunch.

09:32.892 --> 09:34.723
This is no good.

09:36.292 --> 09:38.123
This is no good.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.163
Call her house.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.645
Hi. Are you okay?

09:48.172 --> 09:50.640
No, no. No...

09:55.492 --> 09:57.323
She hung up.

09:58.372 --> 09:59.930
Not good.

10:01.292 --> 10:03.806
All right, look,
there's nothing to be worried about.

10:03.972 --> 10:06.008
She's just a little annoyed right now.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.083
Tomorrow, I'll personally
go over there.

10:08.612 --> 10:11.172
I'll apologize. I'll get the papers.

10:11.932 --> 10:14.651
Don't worry. Don't worry.

10:16.172 --> 10:18.049
Not good.

10:20.572 --> 10:23.006
Yeah, it's a windshield.

10:24.252 --> 10:26.971
I can see that. What's it for?

10:27.132 --> 10:29.043
I found it on the road.

10:33.452 --> 10:35.408
- Yeah?
- I just finished working out.

10:35.572 --> 10:38.325
- Are you busy?
- No. Come on up.

10:38.492 --> 10:41.689
Can you believe somebody
threw this out?

10:43.132 --> 10:46.010
I'm gonna make a coffee table
out of this and surprise Tina.

10:46.172 --> 10:48.322
Well, wouldn't it be invisible?

10:48.492 --> 10:51.564
I mean, what, are you gonna just
sense it's in front of the couch?

10:52.132 --> 10:53.770
Well...

11:02.292 --> 11:03.771
Hello.

11:04.172 --> 11:05.924
Hello.

11:08.052 --> 11:10.043
What's with you two?

11:11.332 --> 11:14.927
- You haven't told him?
- Told me what?

11:17.052 --> 11:19.486
Go ahead, tell him.

11:20.052 --> 11:21.849
I saw her naked.

11:28.012 --> 11:30.048
He saw me naked.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.890
Kramer saw me naked.

11:35.372 --> 11:36.691
Well, it was an accident.

11:36.852 --> 11:39.650
Who walks into a woman's bedroom
without knocking? I wanna know.

11:39.972 --> 11:41.963
I thought it was a closet.

11:43.532 --> 11:44.726
Completely naked?

11:44.932 --> 11:47.492
Completely naked.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.523
Jerry, how can I go on?

11:54.412 --> 11:58.200
All right, if it's gonna make you feel
any better, you can see me naked.

11:58.372 --> 11:59.964
No, thank you.

12:00.972 --> 12:02.883
- No, I want you to see me naked.
- No, no, no.

12:03.052 --> 12:04.280
- I wanna show you.
- No! Jerry!

12:04.452 --> 12:06.568
Hold it. Just a second.

12:06.732 --> 12:09.883
Let's not lose our heads here.

12:10.532 --> 12:12.727
Kramer, you know you're always
welcome in my home...

12:12.892 --> 12:15.201
...but as far as Mr. Johnson
is concerned...

12:15.372 --> 12:17.647
...that's another story.

12:20.132 --> 12:23.329
- What is this?
- It's a windshield.

12:23.652 --> 12:25.768
It's going to be
your new coffee table.

12:26.252 --> 12:29.403
I'm gonna kill myself on that thing.
You can't even see it.

12:29.572 --> 12:31.005
You'll sense it.

12:35.812 --> 12:38.280
Well? What happened?
Was she there?

12:38.452 --> 12:40.283
No. No, she wasn't.

12:40.452 --> 12:42.682
- You didn't get my papers?
- No, I didn't.

12:45.572 --> 12:46.971
Well, where is she?

12:47.972 --> 12:50.406
A mental institution.

12:51.332 --> 12:54.165
Why is it so difficult,
uncomfortable to be naked?

12:54.332 --> 12:56.288
It's because we have clothes on...

12:56.452 --> 12:59.922
...you can always make those little
adjustments, which people love to do.

13:00.092 --> 13:03.243
You feel like you're getting it together.
"Yeah, I look pretty good.

13:03.412 --> 13:05.528
Feeling good, looking good."

13:05.692 --> 13:09.890
But when you're naked, it's like...
It's so final. You're just, "Well...

13:10.052 --> 13:11.849
...that's it.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.969
There's nothing else I can do."

13:15.132 --> 13:18.044
That's why I like to wear
a belt when I'm naked.

13:18.212 --> 13:19.804
Because I feel
it gives me something.

13:19.972 --> 13:22.691
Some, you know,
"I'm naked, but, you know..."

13:23.292 --> 13:26.170
I'd like to get pockets to hang
off of the belt. That would be...

13:26.332 --> 13:28.163
Wouldn't that be the ultimate thing?

13:28.332 --> 13:31.324
To be naked
and still be able to do this.

13:31.492 --> 13:34.484
I think that would really help a lot.

13:37.252 --> 13:38.970
A mental institution?

13:39.132 --> 13:42.283
You know what they do in there?
Did you see Cuck oo's Nest?

13:42.532 --> 13:44.762
They put those electrodes
in your head.

13:44.932 --> 13:46.650
It's not really a mental institution.

13:46.812 --> 13:48.450
It's more like a depression clinic.

13:48.612 --> 13:51.968
She went out to Woodhaven and
checked herself in. I'm sick over this.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.043
- Who told you this?
- Her roommate.

13:54.212 --> 13:55.930
I've driven women
to lesbianism before...

13:56.092 --> 13:57.969
...but never to a mental institution.

14:01.532 --> 14:04.205
My friend Bob Sacamano
had shock treatments.

14:04.372 --> 14:07.489
But his synapses were so large,
had no effect.

14:08.692 --> 14:12.287
You know, I hate to raise
a crass financial concern...

14:12.452 --> 14:17.082
...but was there any information
as to the whereabouts of my papers?

14:18.012 --> 14:21.527
She put them in her pocketbook. She
probably took them out there with her.

14:21.732 --> 14:23.802
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

14:23.972 --> 14:25.166
Can we go out there?

14:25.412 --> 14:27.562
- Where?
- Woodhaven.

14:29.732 --> 14:31.085
We could.

14:31.732 --> 14:33.484
I'm very nervous about this.

14:33.732 --> 14:36.883
I've never spoken
to a mental patient before.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.812
My cousin Douglas
was in a place like this one time.

14:39.972 --> 14:43.567
Came over to my house for dinner,
there was no soda...

14:43.732 --> 14:45.723
...and he went berserk.

14:45.892 --> 14:48.531
He was screaming, "Where's
the Pepsi? Where's the Pepsi?"

14:48.692 --> 14:51.160
I should be in a place like this.

14:51.852 --> 14:53.524
I envy this woman.

14:53.972 --> 14:56.440
Get to wear slippers all day.

14:56.732 --> 14:58.848
Friends visit, they pity you.

14:59.572 --> 15:03.645
Pity's very underrated. I like it.
It's good.

15:03.972 --> 15:06.930
Plus, they give you those word-
association tests. I love those.

15:07.092 --> 15:09.162
They're great.
There's no wrong answer.

15:09.332 --> 15:11.971
- Potato.
- Tuberculosis.

15:12.932 --> 15:14.923
- Blanket.
- Leroy.

15:15.172 --> 15:18.005
- Grass.
- Tuberculosis.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.483
Oh, boy. Here she comes.

15:30.652 --> 15:31.926
Oh, my God.

15:37.572 --> 15:40.484
Oh, Kram...

15:50.012 --> 15:52.606
Kramer! Kramer, could you please...

15:52.772 --> 15:54.205
...put something on?

15:55.292 --> 15:57.567
Well... Oh, boy.

15:57.732 --> 15:59.962
Listen, you want some leftovers?

16:00.132 --> 16:03.249
I made some African food.
There's yambalas and sambusa.

16:03.612 --> 16:05.330
Sweetie.

16:05.572 --> 16:09.645
- Are you coming back to bed?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there, babe.

16:12.132 --> 16:14.168
Hi, Elaine.

16:15.772 --> 16:18.525
What did you think
of the coffee table?

16:19.652 --> 16:21.404
It's invisible.

16:21.572 --> 16:22.846
So is everything cool or what?

16:23.012 --> 16:25.526
Yeah, you seem
a little bit dysfunctional.

16:27.012 --> 16:29.480
- Well...
- Come on, Elaine...

16:29.652 --> 16:31.244
...just tell us the truth.

16:32.772 --> 16:34.364
The truth?

16:34.532 --> 16:35.965
You want the truth?

16:37.212 --> 16:38.645
Who are you?

16:40.732 --> 16:43.326
This is my friend...

16:44.452 --> 16:46.204
...Jerry.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.570
Why are you talking like that?

16:49.732 --> 16:51.882
And what do you want?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.451
Want? What could I possibly want?

16:53.612 --> 16:57.730
I just came because I heard so many
nice things about you from George.

16:58.052 --> 16:59.644
George thinks I'm pretentious.

17:00.372 --> 17:02.806
Pretentious. Who isn't pretentious?
I mean...

17:02.972 --> 17:06.646
...if everyone that was pretentious
was in a mental institution...

17:06.811 --> 17:09.723
Obviously,
this isn't a mental institution.

17:11.051 --> 17:14.521
You're trying to take it back because
you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

17:14.692 --> 17:16.762
- No, that's not it at all.
- Don't lie, George!

17:16.932 --> 17:18.047
I'm not a liar.

17:18.652 --> 17:19.925
We're cool. Everything's cool.

17:20.092 --> 17:22.481
- No problem. We're good.
- Just chatting.

17:22.652 --> 17:23.971
Very friendly.

17:26.332 --> 17:28.084
Alrighty.

17:28.772 --> 17:30.842
No reason for us to raise our voices.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.287
I know what you said.
You can't change that.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.488
What I said.
I say stupid things all the time.

17:35.652 --> 17:37.802
I can't go two minutes
without saying something dumb.

17:37.972 --> 17:41.726
It's one stupid thing after another.

17:41.892 --> 17:44.452
So let me ask you, when you come
to one of these places...

17:44.612 --> 17:46.250
...do you bring your pocketbook?

17:47.132 --> 17:48.724
You should be the one criticizing me.

17:48.892 --> 17:51.406
I'm lucky to even know
someone like you.

17:51.892 --> 17:53.484
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

17:53.652 --> 17:56.120
- I'm incapable of guile.
- He's never guiled.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.971
You know, some women keep a lot of
important papers in their pocketbooks.

18:01.132 --> 18:03.009
Like, for example...

18:03.172 --> 18:06.130
...someone else's
personal financial papers.

18:07.372 --> 18:08.566
Papers.

18:08.732 --> 18:11.610
Oh, Jerry. You're the Jerome
with the tax problem.

18:12.572 --> 18:14.449
You know,
after that date with George...

18:14.612 --> 18:17.251
...I got so cuckoo,
I threw out all your papers.

18:17.412 --> 18:19.801
So I'd love to help you,
but I'll just need the copies.

18:21.532 --> 18:23.170
There are no copies.

18:24.132 --> 18:25.451
So...

18:25.612 --> 18:28.046
...are you saying you want
to continue seeing me?

18:28.532 --> 18:30.523
Who makes copies?

18:31.692 --> 18:34.126
The truth is...

18:35.172 --> 18:36.366
...I think...

18:37.972 --> 18:41.408
...you make a very nice couple.

18:43.652 --> 18:45.563
Oh, Kramer.

18:56.852 --> 18:59.161
- Here, Kramer?
- No, no.

18:59.332 --> 19:01.402
Let's go to the couch.

19:04.532 --> 19:07.000
Yes, I'm trying to get
a copy of a receipt...

19:07.172 --> 19:10.209
...for a computer that I bought there.

19:11.652 --> 19:14.166
It was 1987.

19:14.692 --> 19:18.651
I remember I talked to a guy,
had, like, a maroon sport jacket...

19:18.812 --> 19:22.487
...and he might have had a toupee.
Oh, it was a weave?

19:23.492 --> 19:26.529
Okay, well, then I'll come by.

19:26.692 --> 19:27.920
Okay, bye.

19:28.332 --> 19:30.800
Anybody want to take a walk down
to 48th Street?

19:30.972 --> 19:33.327
I think I may have tracked
down another receipt.

19:33.812 --> 19:36.531
I can't. I got to go visit Tina
in the hospital.

19:36.692 --> 19:38.683
- George?
- I'm going to a poetry reading...

19:38.852 --> 19:40.080
...with Patrice.

19:40.252 --> 19:42.163
First-time poets.

19:42.332 --> 19:45.244
It's in a burnt-out building
down by the docks.

19:45.812 --> 19:47.564
It's supposed to be good.

19:51.252 --> 19:52.765
Are you going to the hospital now?

19:52.932 --> 19:55.446
- Yeah, I suppose I am.
- All right. Great, great.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.761
We'll share a cab.

19:56.932 --> 19:58.650
You going by 48th.
You can give me a ride.

19:58.812 --> 20:00.086
I'm getting in on that.

20:00.252 --> 20:02.049
- Yeah.
- You know you're chipping in.

20:02.212 --> 20:04.203
You're going that way anyway!

20:04.372 --> 20:06.169
Come on.

20:06.652 --> 20:09.803
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.

20:09.972 --> 20:12.884
At first, I thought, "Well,
IRS kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.

20:13.052 --> 20:16.124
Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe they
have a sense of fun about it."

20:16.292 --> 20:18.886
You know?
But it's bad. It's an ordeal.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.771
And they don't do anything
to keep your spirits up...

20:21.932 --> 20:23.490
...through the ordeal.

20:23.692 --> 20:26.331
I think they should take all
your receipts and put them...

20:26.492 --> 20:28.608
...in one of those big,
Lucite sweepstake drums...

20:28.772 --> 20:30.524
...and just kind of crank
it around there.

20:30.692 --> 20:33.923
Give you a feeling like you might win
something. You know what I mean?

20:34.092 --> 20:35.810
Then they can pull them out and go:

20:35.972 --> 20:39.567
"Oh, I'm sorry.
That's another illegal deduction...

20:39.732 --> 20:44.522
...but we do have some lovely
parting gifts for you. Jail."
