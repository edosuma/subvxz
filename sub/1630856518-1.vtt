01:25.760 --> 01:27.519
- Hey, Uncle?
- Be quiet!

01:27.599 --> 01:28.760
Shh, Totò.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.760
Grab this.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.599
Okay...

01:41.239 --> 01:43.000
Goddammit!

01:43.079 --> 01:44.400
It got away.

01:47.319 --> 01:49.719
- Uncle?
- Quiet, shut your mouth!

01:52.120 --> 01:54.079
Hear that, Nino?

01:54.159 --> 01:55.959
- Yes.
- Let's keep quiet.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.280
Where is it?

02:01.920 --> 02:02.959
There, Uncle!

02:04.760 --> 02:05.799
Hush!

02:17.319 --> 02:18.560
Move.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.080
Watch...

02:24.919 --> 02:25.879
You got it.

02:26.879 --> 02:28.439
You got it!

02:28.759 --> 02:30.840
See? Come on.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.479
Totò, do you have balls
or are you a sissy?

02:45.560 --> 02:48.520
- Go get the rabbit.
- No, I'm afraid.

02:48.599 --> 02:49.759
Go!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.240
- Don't be afraid, go.
- I'm afraid!

02:52.319 --> 02:53.919
You're useless.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.439
Next time you'd better do it.

03:02.879 --> 03:04.039
Look at this!

03:06.240 --> 03:07.199
Let's go.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.240
Watch out for the thorns, Totò.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.919
Nino!

03:27.719 --> 03:29.360
Uncle, there's an echo.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.759
Nino!

03:37.680 --> 03:39.960
- These Poles sure can play.
- Yeah.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.080
They're hogging the ball.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.120
Damn, pathetic!

04:02.680 --> 04:04.280
Hey, shut that radio off!

04:05.360 --> 04:06.680
Get lost!

04:13.680 --> 04:15.199
Kick, kick!

04:15.560 --> 04:17.120
Fuck!

04:17.199 --> 04:18.680
Gianni-Bonnie?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.120
Hey!

Gianni-Bonnie?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.079
Gianni-Bonnie?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.720
Are you deaf?

04:34.959 --> 04:36.240
Gianni-Bonnie?

04:37.439 --> 04:40.279
Come have coffee with your friends.

04:40.839 --> 04:41.959
Come on!

04:49.240 --> 04:50.920
I'm talking to you.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.639
Come here.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.199
He's talking to you!

05:04.319 --> 05:07.399
My friend's talking to you,
didn't you hear?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.279
Have some coffee.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.199
Don't be afraid, come here.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.879
Are you ignoring your friends?

05:13.959 --> 05:15.800
Is mommy waiting for you?

05:15.879 --> 05:18.000
His mommy is waiting for him!

05:19.480 --> 05:21.160
Go have some coffee.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.240
Gianni-Bonnie?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.600
The coffee's on us.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.160
That's better,
have some coffee with your friends.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.720
Go in.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.360
Stop it!

05:47.279 --> 05:48.680
Go in!

05:53.160 --> 05:54.680
Sergio, a coffee for our pal.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.079
You don't say thanks?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.839
Like it, don't you?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.600
You can say you like it, don't worry.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.519
You don't like it?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.160
Yes, you do.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.639
Everyone knows what you like.

06:15.439 --> 06:17.920
Everyone knows what you want.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.560
There, that's better...

06:23.639 --> 06:25.120
Pretty!

06:26.160 --> 06:27.360
So pretty.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.800
Pretty Gianni-Bonnie...

06:33.079 --> 06:34.800
Such a pretty girl.

06:35.439 --> 06:37.319
Pretty Gianni-Bonnie!

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
Stay still, Gianni-Bonnie.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.959
Hey!

07:15.120 --> 07:17.279
So, what's up?

07:22.759 --> 07:24.920
Leave the kid alone.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.519
If you say so, I'll have to obey.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.319
Gimme the gun.

07:42.319 --> 07:43.439
Grandpa!

07:46.439 --> 07:48.879
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Careful, Totò.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.199
Hi, Grandpa.

07:52.279 --> 07:53.519
Hi, Dad.

Alfredo.

Pietro...

08:03.120 --> 08:04.839
- How's it going?
- Fine.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.959
How'd it go?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.160
- Fine.
- Any problems?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.560
The Santa Venerina fireworks?

08:11.639 --> 08:14.240
- All set.
- What did the councilor say?

08:14.319 --> 08:17.000
- Did you tell him we're brothers?
- He wasn't there.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.920
I'll call him.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.040
C'mon, boys.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.519
I knew it, I should've gone.

08:23.279 --> 08:26.040
There's no need, I'll handle it.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.759
You? You let people
push you around.

08:29.839 --> 08:31.839
Pietro, enough.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.639
Not in front of the boys.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.919
You take it,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.279
my wife's no good at cooking.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.279
- Thanks, see you.
- Bye.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.320
Totò, what are you doing in there?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.799
Nino, come here.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.840
This was your grandfather's,
it's yours now.

08:55.879 --> 08:58.639
You graduated, so you deserve it,
good job.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.879
- Thanks, Uncle.
- Bye.

09:07.759 --> 09:09.720
Look, Dad.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.879
So we're not doing
the Santa Venerina fireworks?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.559
Bullshit!
I'll sort everything out.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.360
Here's the list
of what we need for tonight.

09:34.039 --> 09:36.759
Rope, igniter cord, rubber bands...

09:37.200 --> 09:39.000
You're telling me what to get?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.799
I was shooting fireworks
before you were born!

09:41.879 --> 09:43.559
I'll just leave it here.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.039
Totò, you okay?

09:55.440 --> 09:56.360
Gianni!

09:58.720 --> 10:00.120
I'm sorry.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.919
Sorry they're tormenting you,
but what can I do?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.840
That's how they are.

10:05.919 --> 10:07.600
Do you hear what you're saying?

10:10.440 --> 10:14.559
Good, keep your mouth shut.
You cause trouble when you talk.

10:14.639 --> 10:17.679
I didn't want to tell them,
but they made me.

10:17.759 --> 10:20.120
Plus, it's your fault.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.759
- Mine?
- Yes!

10:23.240 --> 10:25.799
You never worried
about what they'd do to you.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.279
You told them about it for fun.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.639
Get lost!

10:52.840 --> 10:54.919
Gianni's here, stop.

10:57.679 --> 10:59.159
Wait...

10:59.679 --> 11:00.799
Stop!

11:02.279 --> 11:04.039
I can't even fuck in peace.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.679
Tell him not to drink
from the bottle as usual!

11:09.399 --> 11:10.679
That pig...

11:49.399 --> 11:51.440
Want some lemon on it?

12:00.679 --> 12:02.120
What's wrong?

12:05.519 --> 12:07.080
They're tormenting you again?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.720
- So what's new?
- You tell us!

12:10.799 --> 12:14.000
- What for?
- We both have the right to know.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.320
He doesn't give a shit,
he just wants to avoid gossip.

12:17.639 --> 12:21.519
- Don't disrespect him.
- Respect? Want me to kiss his hand?

12:22.679 --> 12:24.440
- Do you?
- Shut up!

12:28.480 --> 12:32.840
It's your fault
because you took him back in.

12:34.519 --> 12:38.879
If it were for me, he would've stayed
in the reformatory.

12:40.399 --> 12:44.480
But since I love your mom
and I had no other choice,

12:44.559 --> 12:48.039
I let you work in my garage
even if you're useless.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.039
But now things...

12:56.279 --> 12:58.000
I'm talking to you!

12:59.159 --> 13:01.000
That's my fucking garage,

13:01.080 --> 13:04.159
not some freak show
for people to laugh at.

13:04.879 --> 13:06.360
Hear me?

13:08.279 --> 13:10.840
And you? Got nothing to say?

13:13.399 --> 13:15.080
What can I say?

13:15.159 --> 13:16.919
Think it's easy growing up
without a father?

13:18.159 --> 13:20.159
Then he should kill himself.

14:32.919 --> 14:35.679
- Hi, Uncle.
- Hey.

14:35.759 --> 14:37.000
Grandma!

14:38.720 --> 14:40.360
Uncle caught a rabbit.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.360
A rabbit? Grandma
makes a tasty rabbit stew!

14:43.879 --> 14:45.399
Look at him, he never sweats!

14:46.879 --> 14:49.039
I sweat plenty last night!

14:49.440 --> 14:51.200
Don't say that in front of the kid.

14:52.039 --> 14:54.960
We gotta teach these kids
what life is about!

14:56.519 --> 14:58.159
Nino, come here.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.360
What's up, Uncle?

15:05.240 --> 15:07.480
Know what I did last night?

15:07.559 --> 15:08.679
What?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.919
- I won't tell you.
- Come on!

15:13.240 --> 15:15.559
- What are you making?
- Pasta with sauce.

15:15.639 --> 15:18.080
Last night
I didn't hit on any old girl,

15:19.240 --> 15:21.759
I hit on the prettiest girl there was.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.360
Know what I said to her?

15:26.879 --> 15:29.960
You know, I'm not sure
which of your eyes is prettiest...

15:30.039 --> 15:31.480
What did she say?

15:31.559 --> 15:33.279
Fuck you, that's what.

15:34.279 --> 15:35.799
What does your dad know?!

15:36.519 --> 15:38.279
Don't spoil your appetite.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.480
- Put that cigarette out.
- Leave me alone, Dad.

15:45.159 --> 15:47.639
- Look.
- Leave it there.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.639
- Is it lunchtime?
- Nino, come here.

15:53.399 --> 15:54.679
Hi, Mom.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.279
Look what Uncle Pietro gave me.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.120
Get the bread, oil, and salt.

16:00.679 --> 16:01.879
- Isabella?
- Yes?

16:01.960 --> 16:02.919
Come here.

16:14.399 --> 16:15.440
Totò, stop!

16:18.480 --> 16:20.279
Cut the bread, go on.

16:23.919 --> 16:25.360
I want some bread.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.240
Dummy! That's bad luck.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.159
You're bad luck!

16:30.679 --> 16:33.600
Is that how you talk to your mom?
Clean it up.

16:33.679 --> 16:35.600
Quit laughing and help out.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.159
What did you do?

16:44.559 --> 16:46.159
Totò, listen...

16:46.240 --> 16:47.559
What?

16:47.639 --> 16:50.000
You and I need to form a partnership.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.039
Really? What does that mean?

16:52.919 --> 16:54.559
That we'll always be together.

16:55.039 --> 16:56.799
- For real?
- Yes.

16:57.399 --> 16:58.919
Hurry up, I'm hungry.

17:00.639 --> 17:01.639
Eat up.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.400
Did you give Uncle Nino the moped yet?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.160
Did you really buy me one?

17:15.680 --> 17:17.720
It was meant to be a surprise, Totò.

17:18.759 --> 17:20.799
- She told me to say it.
- No way!

17:21.319 --> 17:23.960
- He repeats what he hears.
- Where is it?

17:24.279 --> 17:27.079
Sit down, finish eating first.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.279
I knew it.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.440
You can't blame him for being curious,
I am too!

17:40.799 --> 17:43.079
- Come on.
- She never blames him.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.119
Like it?

17:51.920 --> 17:53.759
A graduation present.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.799
- You deserve it.
- Thanks, Mom.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.680
- Like it? Is it the one you wanted?
- Yes, it's awesome.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.680
Go test it out.

18:03.319 --> 18:05.039
- I'll take a spin.
- Go slowly!

18:08.920 --> 18:13.039
Alfredo, you couldn't buy a new one?!
That's like a war relic!

18:17.440 --> 18:19.480
Let's go see the moped.

18:19.839 --> 18:20.960
Go.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.000
Uncle!

18:34.319 --> 18:36.400
Damn, how cool!

18:36.799 --> 18:39.599
- Let me get on.
- Hold on.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.480
- Please!
- Give your nephew a ride.

18:43.119 --> 18:45.400
- Grandma, tell him.
- Totò, wait.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.960
Stop it, Totò.

18:49.319 --> 18:52.160
Don't be late,
we're leaving at 6:00.

18:53.039 --> 18:55.839
You said we'd form a partnership!

18:56.880 --> 18:58.480
Please, Uncle.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.160
What's wrong?

21:01.359 --> 21:03.960
Dunno, how about 50,000 liras?

21:04.599 --> 21:07.039
Consider it done, Mr. Sciacca.

21:09.319 --> 21:10.519
All right.

21:11.839 --> 21:14.200
Happy birthday to your son, bye.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.200
Mr. Sciacca's son's moped,

21:22.480 --> 21:25.240
they can't come pick it up.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.799
Go deliver it.

21:30.079 --> 21:32.960
They live far away,
how'll I get back?

21:34.119 --> 21:37.599
You can take a nice walk,
it's cool at night.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.759
I'm going home, you close up.

21:42.799 --> 21:43.720
Fine.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.680
Gianni? How's it going?

22:11.039 --> 22:12.000
Hey.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.519
Done working?

22:14.599 --> 22:16.920
No, I have to deliver a moped.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.599
Where?

22:18.680 --> 22:20.599
- Far away.
- I'll come.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.119
No need.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.799
Why not?

22:24.799 --> 22:26.839
We can stop for a beer.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.440
Like we used to.

22:29.519 --> 22:30.880
I don't want to.

22:31.279 --> 22:34.119
You don't want to today?
What's wrong?

22:34.640 --> 22:35.880
Nothing.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.160
Ignore those dumbasses.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.240
Don't worry, I'll look out for you.

22:43.839 --> 22:45.680
Leave me alone, I have to go.

22:46.519 --> 22:47.880
Why?

22:49.359 --> 22:51.799
- You're so handsome.
- Please...

22:52.119 --> 22:54.000
- Come here.
- No, Turi.

22:54.079 --> 22:55.799
- Relax.
- I have to go.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.319
Relax.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.640
No, Turi! Leave me alone.

23:01.759 --> 23:03.480
Come here.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.680
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

23:07.720 --> 23:09.119
You fucking fairy!

23:12.640 --> 23:14.880
Emanuele? Emanuele!

23:16.240 --> 23:17.720
- Come with me.
- Huh?

23:17.799 --> 23:18.720
Let's go.

23:43.279 --> 23:45.319
- Leave me alone!
- Get over here.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.440
Leave me alone, please.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.480
Stop.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.519
Gianni-Bonnie!

24:40.160 --> 24:41.759
Go, go!

25:01.720 --> 25:03.480
It's my fault, I didn't see you.

25:04.279 --> 25:05.480
Breathe.

25:07.519 --> 25:08.720
Breathe!

25:09.160 --> 25:10.079
Come on.

25:33.839 --> 25:35.079
Are you okay?

25:40.440 --> 25:43.839
If you need anything, I'm Nino Scalia,
I live in Triona...

25:43.920 --> 25:45.759
my father is Alfredo Scalia...

25:46.200 --> 25:49.359
We shoot fireworks, everyone knows us.
Here you go.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.640
Feeling better?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.240
Are you okay?

26:39.039 --> 26:40.839
I'm sorry, Dad...

26:42.160 --> 26:44.319
- Where were you?
- I had an accident.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.799
With your new moped?

26:46.240 --> 26:48.200
- Are you hurt?
- No.

26:48.279 --> 26:49.680
He's fine.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.400
Let's go, money doesn't grow on trees.

26:53.319 --> 26:54.400
Go on.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.319
- Mr. Sciacca?
- Coming.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.319
Hello.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.000
- How are you?
- Fine.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.240
- Everything okay with the moped?
- Yes.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.839
- Where should I leave it?
- Right there, it's a surprise.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.599
Thank your boss for me

27:41.680 --> 27:44.680
and tell him that men like him
are a rarity nowadays.

27:44.759 --> 27:46.640
Luca, the cake's ready.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.920
Coming!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.119
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.319
Happy birthday to you

27:52.839 --> 27:55.480
Happy birthday to you...

29:03.599 --> 29:05.400
- Gimme the fuse.
- Okay.

29:23.519 --> 29:24.799
- Ready?
- Yes.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.200
Let's go.

30:18.519 --> 30:21.279
- The first round's done.
- Set up the second.

30:23.599 --> 30:25.440
- Be careful.
- Yes.

30:31.519 --> 30:33.440
- What's wrong, Dad?
- Nothing.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.559
Don't worry.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.000
Set it up.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.079
Gimme.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.839
Finish up.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.720
- You take over.
- Are you okay, Dad?

31:03.720 --> 31:04.799
Dad?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.559
Light it.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.839
Where is it?

31:12.920 --> 31:14.519
Light it.

31:18.279 --> 31:19.200
Dad!

31:35.759 --> 31:37.480
Where's the spray?

31:38.720 --> 31:40.480
In the van, find it.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.480
Breathe.

32:25.039 --> 32:26.359
Breathe.

32:32.519 --> 32:34.079
Better?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.559
You have hot flashes!

33:03.000 --> 33:05.119
Me? Hell no.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.720
How dare you?!

33:10.160 --> 33:12.880
Sweetie, your loverboy
isn't showing up tonight.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.960
But if Italy wins the game,
he'll be celebrating for sure.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.599
Want some fun, honey?

34:06.079 --> 34:07.480
Trying to kill me?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.000
Who, me?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.840
- What happened?
- He's trying to kill you.

34:13.519 --> 34:16.400
You left the garage open,
he had to go close up.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.880
Apologize tomorrow
or he'll kill you.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.639
Who were you with?

34:51.840 --> 34:53.519
Scooch over.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.119
Dad, don't smoke.
If Mom sees you she'll flip put.

37:08.199 --> 37:10.000
Don't get on my case,

37:10.079 --> 37:14.280
I'm annoyed enough as it is
with these people not answering!

37:53.920 --> 37:55.480
How are you?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.159
Fine, why wouldn't I be?

37:59.679 --> 38:01.599
You scared me last night.

38:02.199 --> 38:03.960
Nino, nothing happened.

38:04.639 --> 38:08.440
And since nothing happened,
nobody needs to know.

38:09.159 --> 38:10.559
Understand?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.159
Yes.

38:12.239 --> 38:13.360
Go to work.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.280
Who's that?

38:58.599 --> 39:00.280
Looking for someone?

39:00.360 --> 39:01.760
Mr. Scalia.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.800
- For what?
- I'm looking for work.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.719
Wait here.

39:08.719 --> 39:11.000
Dad, a boy is looking for you.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.280
Nino, go see who it is.

39:14.639 --> 39:17.320
Finally!
I've been calling you all morning.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.679
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:21.519 --> 39:24.239
- Did you have moped trouble?
- No...

39:24.320 --> 39:28.360
- It was my fault, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.159
I meant to apologize.

39:30.239 --> 39:31.960
- The moped accident?
- Yes.

39:32.360 --> 39:35.199
We're good people,
if there's damage we'll pay.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.159
No, I'm not here for money,
the moped's fine.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.960
I was delivering it to a customer
for my boss.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.039
I work in a garage.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.760
And your boss made you walk home?

39:46.840 --> 39:48.920
Yes, that's why I want to quit.

39:50.159 --> 39:51.719
Looking for work?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.480
- Good luck...
- Yes.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.840
Is that why you're all dressed up?
What's your name?

39:58.119 --> 39:59.519
Gianni, hello.

40:01.880 --> 40:04.880
That's a nice shirt, though.
Come in.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.480
- May I?
- Sure.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.320
Okay...

40:09.679 --> 40:11.000
goodbye.

40:13.960 --> 40:18.159
Dad, he's the guy from the accident.
He's looking for work.

40:18.559 --> 40:20.159
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.199
My son told me what happened,

40:30.760 --> 40:32.320
he was in the wrong.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.400
- No, no...
- No, what?

40:35.599 --> 40:37.760
Apologize to him in front of me.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.119
Sorry.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.320
Good.

40:43.559 --> 40:45.159
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

40:45.239 --> 40:47.840
- I'm hungry, let's go eat.
- I know, Totò.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.079
If my stomach is empty

40:51.039 --> 40:54.639
and I'm ticked off, I can't talk
about anything, let alone work.

40:54.719 --> 40:55.760
Come on.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.480
Your mom has always been pretty.

41:02.559 --> 41:05.480
- What's that for?
- You'll see.

41:05.559 --> 41:07.519
I liked her
as soon as I set eyes on her.

41:08.719 --> 41:10.440
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

41:11.559 --> 41:15.000
But I made the decision
one night at her house...

41:15.079 --> 41:18.559
We were dating, and her parents,
her mother,

41:19.719 --> 41:22.880
invited me over for pizza
that she made.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.960
- When I saw her...
- Knock it off!

41:26.079 --> 41:27.599
Carmela?

41:28.239 --> 41:30.599
She's blushing, look at her.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.719
Carmela,
you were beautiful, elegant.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.440
- You still are!
- We have a guest.

41:37.519 --> 41:38.920
I know.

41:41.239 --> 41:42.679
The cigarette...

41:44.400 --> 41:46.079
- What's that?
- Shh!

41:47.880 --> 41:50.360
- Time to eat.
- Sit straight.

41:57.639 --> 41:59.079
Eat it with your hands.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.440
Gianni, what does your dad do?

42:03.480 --> 42:05.639
My dad left...

42:07.480 --> 42:09.000
a few years ago...

42:09.079 --> 42:10.960
he went to work in Germany.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.159
I haven't seen him in a while.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.119
But he works hard,

42:20.800 --> 42:24.239
he takes whatever job he can.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.880
I want to be like him.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.320
See how he talks about his dad?

42:35.119 --> 42:37.239
That's how you talk about a dad.

42:37.559 --> 42:38.840
Understand?

42:39.679 --> 42:42.039
You're a good kid, Gianni.

42:42.559 --> 42:44.400
Even for how you talk about your dad.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.440
Listen,

42:47.519 --> 42:49.480
hold your head high,

42:49.559 --> 42:52.880
be proud of what you are
and the family you have.

42:55.639 --> 42:59.119
- Now that we're eating...
- I forgot the salad with onions!

42:59.199 --> 43:00.559
..let's talk about work.

43:01.280 --> 43:04.639
I can tell you're a good kid,
but I'll be straight with you,

43:04.719 --> 43:06.559
I can't give you a job.

43:07.119 --> 43:09.679
I can't afford to pay a worker.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.519
Who wants some?

43:11.599 --> 43:14.519
We're talking about important stuff,
never mind onions!

43:15.440 --> 43:16.760
Geez...

43:17.639 --> 43:21.159
I was thinking that tomorrow morning
I could ask my brother

43:21.239 --> 43:24.000
if he needs help at the quarry,
sound good?

43:24.800 --> 43:26.360
Great.

43:28.119 --> 43:31.400
- Have you ever split rocks?
- No, but I can learn.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.800
If you ever finish school,
you can work with Uncle too.

43:35.119 --> 43:38.360
- I won't work at the quarry!
- You want to be a scientist?

43:38.440 --> 43:41.320
- No, a soccer player.
- You need to pass exams first.

43:42.079 --> 43:43.679
Did you study the poem?

43:44.599 --> 43:47.159
- Will you really help me?
- Of course.

43:47.239 --> 43:49.679
I thought you'd only help him now.

43:54.559 --> 43:56.559
- What's your name?
- Gianni.

43:58.320 --> 44:00.639
It hasn't been driven in ages.

44:01.239 --> 44:04.000
Must be the spark plug, don't worry.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.320
It's rusted.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.559
Gimme a rag and sandpaper.

44:09.119 --> 44:10.880
- Isabella?
- Yes?

44:10.960 --> 44:12.519
- Isabella?
- What?

44:12.880 --> 44:14.760
Help me with the bottles.

44:17.199 --> 44:19.440
Are you watching the game tomorrow?

44:19.519 --> 44:21.320
- What game?
- What game?!

44:22.000 --> 44:23.400
The World Cup?

44:23.840 --> 44:24.760
Yes.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.519
You'd eat pasta with sauce
for breakfast!

44:28.599 --> 44:30.719
Why did your mom
put the spoon in her mouth?

44:31.599 --> 44:35.079
She says it's a trick
for cutting onions without crying.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.760
I didn't know that.
Give it a try.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.840
See?

44:57.320 --> 45:00.920
So you cleaned the spark plug,
it's your job after all.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.039
It was...

45:02.599 --> 45:05.280
Anyway, I don't have any money.

45:05.599 --> 45:08.480
I'll drive you home
and we'll call it even.

45:08.559 --> 45:11.239
No, I'll take the bus, no need.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.519
Come on, it's 30 minutes.

45:13.599 --> 45:15.440
- No need to.
- Come on.

45:18.679 --> 45:21.280
Is there anything left
for us to eat?

45:21.599 --> 45:22.519
Look who's up!

45:22.880 --> 45:26.199
Thanks, by the way, lunch was great.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.639
I had a good time with you all.

45:30.679 --> 45:32.360
You have a nice family.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.880
Say bye to your dad,
I don't want to bother him.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.960
Bye, Gianni. Come back soon.

45:41.039 --> 45:43.760
- Okay, goodbye.
- Bye.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.360
- Bye.
- Bye.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.519
Totò, go buy me cigarettes.

45:48.039 --> 45:50.440
Do you realize what time it is?

46:13.400 --> 46:14.800
One,

46:14.880 --> 46:16.639
two, three...

46:17.320 --> 46:20.360
four, five, six,

46:20.920 --> 46:24.159
seven, eight, nine...

46:55.199 --> 46:57.639
Look who's here? Enzo!

46:58.920 --> 47:00.800
Enzo, come here.

47:05.719 --> 47:07.039
Come here.

47:14.239 --> 47:17.280
Enzo, show these kids
how to lift up a car.

47:19.679 --> 47:21.320
He can do it.

47:23.639 --> 47:25.360
I bet 1,000 liras.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.280
He can do it.

47:32.559 --> 47:34.280
Enzo, Enzo, Enzo!

47:35.880 --> 47:38.719
One, two, three,

47:39.360 --> 47:41.440
four, five, six,

47:41.760 --> 47:44.639
seven, eight, nine, ten!

47:50.280 --> 47:51.480
Holy cow!

47:52.480 --> 47:54.519
What the fuck?! That's my car.

47:58.920 --> 48:00.239
Enzo's amazing.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.199
Look who's here...

48:11.199 --> 48:12.559
Why so happy?

48:14.440 --> 48:16.079
It's Miss Italy...

48:20.639 --> 48:22.239
Sergio, coffee.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.639
See that?

48:28.239 --> 48:30.079
He's looking for trouble today.

48:31.760 --> 48:33.519
What are you doing?

48:37.119 --> 48:38.800
What are you up to?

48:42.519 --> 48:44.559
Why are you instigating them?

48:45.760 --> 48:48.360
Don't you realize
they'll destroy you?

48:53.960 --> 48:55.960
You wanted a coffee?

49:08.599 --> 49:12.000
Bring him a coffee too,
since he's always fucking.

49:14.159 --> 49:15.599
Franco...

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
Franco the Ladyfucker.

49:27.679 --> 49:29.519
Franco...

49:35.800 --> 49:38.519
Yeah, it's best you close the shop.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.920
Go home, Franco...

49:53.400 --> 49:54.360
Mom.

49:56.079 --> 49:58.039
You're totally nuts!

49:58.119 --> 49:59.199
Nuts!

49:59.280 --> 50:01.599
- It's fine.
- What's fine?

50:01.679 --> 50:04.719
Don't you realize
he'll kick us both out of this house?

50:04.800 --> 50:07.199
Remember how we used to live?

50:07.280 --> 50:10.519
Now go apologize to him
because money is sacred!

50:10.599 --> 50:12.400
I found a job, Mom.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.880
We'll get out of here soon.

50:15.199 --> 50:17.480
- We'll leave.
- What?

50:17.559 --> 50:20.039
We'll get our own house, I'll pay.

50:20.679 --> 50:22.920
We don't need him, understand?

50:23.840 --> 50:25.519
We don't need anyone.

50:25.599 --> 50:28.159
- Get over here.
- Let me talk to him.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.519
Never set foot in my garage again!

50:32.880 --> 50:34.639
- Don't, Franco.
- Get off.

50:34.719 --> 50:36.440
- Leave him alone.
- Get out of here.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.960
Or you'll regret being born!

50:39.280 --> 50:40.679
Leave him alone.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.360
Get out.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.239
What the hell?!

50:52.840 --> 50:54.760
This is my house, understand?

50:57.360 --> 50:59.280
And I make the rules here.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.719
Pasquale, where's the list?

51:06.760 --> 51:07.679
Okay...

51:09.639 --> 51:11.599
- You?
- Salvatore Mastuono.

51:11.679 --> 51:14.079
Salvatore, I know you.
Go ahead.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.000
- Antonino, here again?
- Yes.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.519
Go work the excavator.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.039
- Is this your first time?
- Yes, Mr. Scalia.

51:25.119 --> 51:26.960
- Name?
- Michele Mannino.

51:27.280 --> 51:28.480
Michele Mannino...

51:30.960 --> 51:33.719
- Willing to work hard?
- I have a family.

51:34.199 --> 51:37.039
Go get your gear
before I change my mind.

51:37.119 --> 51:38.280
Thanks.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.719
Pasquale? Take over.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.559
Morning.

51:46.199 --> 51:47.440
Morning.

51:49.079 --> 51:52.000
I heard this Formula One champ
crashed into you?

51:52.320 --> 51:54.719
Ignore my brother,
he thinks he's funny.

51:55.039 --> 51:57.360
- Look at this.
- It's not his fault.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.119
Gianni Accordino, hello.

52:01.119 --> 52:02.559
Hello.

52:05.119 --> 52:07.880
- How are you?
- Fine, why shouldn't I be?

52:07.960 --> 52:10.639
Don't worry,
I'll go to Santa Venerina tonight.

52:10.719 --> 52:13.360
- No need.
- No need, my foot.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.880
I want them to say it to my face!

52:16.199 --> 52:18.599
- Don't do this...
- Alfredo...

52:18.960 --> 52:22.199
They should respect you
because you're a good man.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.440
- Gianni, ready?
- Yes.

52:24.519 --> 52:26.679
We should get to work too.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.679
- Thanks again, Mr. Scalia.
- Later, kid.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.320
Enjoy, Gianni.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.440
Bye, Uncle.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.920
Pasquale,
put Gianni Accordino on the list.

52:42.800 --> 52:46.639
Gianni, thanks to my brother
you skipped the line,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.119
but you need to work
as hard as the others.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.400
Okay.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.960
Show him the ropes,
by tonight I want him to be a pro.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.000
Let's go.

52:57.039 --> 52:58.000
See those branches?

52:59.320 --> 53:01.039
Here's what you'll do...

53:11.039 --> 53:12.519
All set, thanks.

53:24.679 --> 53:26.079
Slowly.

53:27.639 --> 53:28.800
Go.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.719
Go, go.

53:34.199 --> 53:35.119
Stop!

53:35.880 --> 53:37.280
Stop!

53:37.760 --> 53:39.239
Shut it off!

53:39.320 --> 53:40.800
What's going on?

53:50.880 --> 53:53.559
Sorry,
I was taking a cigarette break.

53:53.639 --> 53:55.400
Go home.

53:55.480 --> 53:58.559
What do you mean?
I have a family.

53:58.639 --> 54:00.079
I told you,

54:00.159 --> 54:03.760
nobody should be on the stairs
when the truck's unloading.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.960
Hear me?

54:07.519 --> 54:09.800
Get moving or I will drag you out.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.480
Go home, you dud.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.119
You did good, it's not the first time
he's done stupid shit.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.039
Pasquale...

54:37.519 --> 54:39.320
that's what I'm here for.

54:40.079 --> 54:41.320
Right.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.679
What are you looking at?

54:50.840 --> 54:53.679
Nothing happened,
get back to work now.

55:14.559 --> 55:16.320
Cheers!

55:21.559 --> 55:25.440
Did you watch the game?
Paolo Rossi: 2-0! Up yours!

55:42.639 --> 55:44.039
Bye, Gioacchino.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.400
Gianni, come here.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.440
I was watching you.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.480
I saw how you move.

56:08.599 --> 56:09.559
Good job.

56:10.559 --> 56:14.079
This is hard work
and it takes a while to learn the ropes.

56:15.119 --> 56:16.880
But your first day was good,

56:17.559 --> 56:18.920
you work hard.

56:19.559 --> 56:20.599
Thanks.

56:25.920 --> 56:26.960
Bye.

56:27.039 --> 56:28.039
Goodbye.

56:31.679 --> 56:35.320
No more hunting with me
now that you're a Formula One champ?

56:35.400 --> 56:36.840
No, Uncle.

56:37.239 --> 56:38.360
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:38.679 --> 56:40.400
Are you going to watch the game?

56:40.719 --> 56:44.239
No, I want to stay outside,
want to come with me?

56:44.559 --> 56:46.719
No, drive me to the bus stop.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.760
- I want to take you somewhere.
- Where?

56:49.760 --> 56:51.719
A place only I know about.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.199
Come on.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.440
All right...

57:29.679 --> 57:32.199
There's gunpowder in here,

57:32.280 --> 57:35.800
when the shell goes into the mortar,
the first explosion

57:35.880 --> 57:37.440
causes the gas to expand,

57:37.519 --> 57:40.719
the shell shoots into the air
and flies.

57:41.159 --> 57:45.199
And when it's high up,
really fucking high,

57:45.880 --> 57:47.119
it explodes,

57:47.519 --> 57:50.599
and then you see all the colors
you put inside.

57:50.679 --> 57:52.519
Blue, red, green,

57:53.119 --> 57:54.360
yellow, purple,

57:54.679 --> 57:55.960
and all.

57:58.599 --> 58:00.480
You didn't understand a thing?

58:01.440 --> 58:04.199
I understood it explodes
and we see colors.

58:04.280 --> 58:07.000
Never mind then.
Look...

58:11.639 --> 58:13.719
My grandpa drew these.

58:15.079 --> 58:16.639
I drew this.

58:20.400 --> 58:23.400
To start,
you need a little warning shot.

58:23.480 --> 58:24.760
Heads-up!

58:26.159 --> 58:29.599
People look up
and you've caught their attention.

58:30.159 --> 58:33.079
Then you have to decide
what your message is.

58:35.559 --> 58:39.000
If you want to talk about love,
use softer colors.

58:40.840 --> 58:45.519
If you're pissed off with someone,
you want to show your anger.

58:47.199 --> 58:50.000
And if you want to scare someone,
no problem.

58:50.079 --> 58:51.840
You have an arsenal.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.360
What are you doing?

59:00.719 --> 59:02.280
The grand finale.

59:16.599 --> 59:18.960
Because every story ends, right?

59:23.599 --> 59:24.800
What's wrong?

59:29.639 --> 59:32.760
You kissed me last time,
after the accident.

59:33.800 --> 59:36.639
Nonsense, I didn't kiss you,
it was CPR.

59:37.079 --> 59:38.760
I saved you.

59:40.320 --> 59:43.159
Go wash up, you're all filthy.

59:43.599 --> 59:45.719
I'm not washing up in there,

59:45.800 --> 59:47.320
that water's ice cold.

59:57.960 --> 59:59.360
Come on.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.039
Nino!

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.039
I'm here, dummy!

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.840
I got scared, I thought you drowned.

01:00:46.239 --> 01:00:48.840
Careful, the current's strong there.

01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:51.960
We come here every day,
you should know.

01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:05.800
When's the last bus?

01:01:07.199 --> 01:01:09.079
Soon, I told you.

01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:11.079
So you have to catch that one...

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.960
I told you, hurry up!

01:01:17.199 --> 01:01:18.760
- Come on.
- Hold on.

01:01:24.119 --> 01:01:25.360
Move it.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.000
- Hold on.
- I'm leaving you here, bye.

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:31.880
You can't, it's my moped!

01:01:43.039 --> 01:01:45.440
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:10.800
Dummy! You fell for it.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.239
Hop on.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.280
- That's where you worked?
- Yes.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.039
He's the guy who fired you?

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.159
Yes.

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.119
He looks like an asshole.

01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:52.320
He sure is.

01:02:53.159 --> 01:02:54.639
Hi.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.119
This is Nino,
he's my quarry boss's nephew.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.679
Hello. They finished late today
so I drove him home.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.280
My uncle said he's a great worker.

01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:05.920
Thanks.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.280
- Come up.
- Okay.

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:16.639
See you.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.679
You don't like me driving you home?

01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:21.519
Because I don't want to impose.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.800
Gimme a break, see you.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.280
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.360
What's that?

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.360
A trick so you don't cry.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.800
Where'd you learn this trick?

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.599
It works.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.679
I can tell!

01:03:58.039 --> 01:03:59.800
You have a new buddy?

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:02.679
Good.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.000
Tune in tomorrow at the same time.

01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:20.840
Here's one last song...

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.159
Which one?

01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:25.239
Let's dance.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.440
Yeah?

01:07:24.599 --> 01:07:26.920
Grab a pick and get started.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.679
- Who are you?
- Rosario Puglisi.

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:39.960
- Is it your first day?
- Yes.

01:07:40.679 --> 01:07:43.000
Then you can cut grass for today.

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:05.920
Kid!

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Are you slacking off?

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.480
No.

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:11.840
Move it!

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.720
Sorry, Mr. Scalia,
but I'm not feeling well.

01:08:46.039 --> 01:08:47.600
Can I go home?

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:51.920
- What's wrong?
- Dunno, I feel feverish.

01:08:53.079 --> 01:08:54.560
Feverish?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.680
Fine, go home.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:01.920
But come back soon,
there's lots of work to do.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.399
- Okay.
- Go on.

01:09:07.119 --> 01:09:09.439
Mr. Scalia, leave it to me.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.640
Be careful with it.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.199
- Hi, Uncle.
- Here he is, regular as clockwork.

01:09:17.239 --> 01:09:18.319
Gianni?

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:21.279
- Your buddy went home.
- Why?

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:25.359
He said he wasn't feeling well,
he was feverish...

01:09:26.039 --> 01:09:29.520
But the truth is,
you're a bunch of pussies!

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.039
- You who?
- You youngsters!

01:09:33.119 --> 01:09:36.119
- So you're saying you're old?
- Get lost!

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.560
- See you.
- Goodbye.

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.199
Yes?

01:10:42.079 --> 01:10:44.119
- Hi.
- Hello. Is Gianni here?

01:10:45.039 --> 01:10:47.800
- No, he's at work.
- Oh, right.

01:10:48.319 --> 01:10:49.920
Did something happen?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.359
No, I didn't realize it was this early.
I'll head there, bye.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.880
Bye.

01:11:01.199 --> 01:11:02.439
Hey, you!

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.960
Who are you looking for?

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.439
- Me?
- You.

01:11:08.039 --> 01:11:09.279
Come here.

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:11.239
Come.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.680
Well?

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.520
I was looking for the guy
who lives there.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.079
Lemme guess,

01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:33.359
looking for Gianni-Bonnie?

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:38.640
Shut up, I'm watching the game
and you're bugging me.

01:11:39.039 --> 01:11:41.359
Let us have some fun.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.239
- Why do you want Gianni?
- Nice, Giuseppina.

01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:47.239
That's how you treat visitors...

01:11:48.079 --> 01:11:51.199
I just came to say hi,
he must still be at work.

01:11:51.279 --> 01:11:53.119
Work? What work?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.720
- That's why he vanished.
- He works with my uncle.

01:11:58.319 --> 01:12:01.199
- See you around.
- Where are you going?

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.560
Hold on.

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:06.399
Did he bullshit you
about his dad working in Germany?

01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:07.720
Germany, Germany...

01:12:08.279 --> 01:12:10.159
You don't know your buddy.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.960
Giuseppina will tell you a story
about him.

01:12:14.479 --> 01:12:15.760
She's playing shy.

01:12:17.439 --> 01:12:19.279
- Turi?
- Knock it off.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.680
I'm watching the game.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.680
I don't want to interrupt.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.880
You're not interrupting at all.

01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:27.840
Your buddy's a fairy.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.000
Giuseppina saw him sucking a guy off,
does he suck you off?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.199
Enough!

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.399
Shut up, I said. Or I'll kill you.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.760
Okay?

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.840
You're still here? Get lost.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.760
Go, you faggot.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.640
Did I scare you?

01:13:11.119 --> 01:13:12.359
What's wrong?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.239
Nothing.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.439
What do you want?

01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:33.079
My uncle said you were sick
so I went to see how you were.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.880
Nino, don't go to my house
unless I say so. Got it?

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:42.680
Anyway, I'm fine now.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.760
Why are you acting like this?

01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:59.279
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Answer me, okay?

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.199
You can't just run off.

01:14:07.439 --> 01:14:10.960
You're not feverish
and you don't have a father.

01:14:13.239 --> 01:14:14.960
You're just bullshitting me.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.159
And I don't want a friend
who bullshits me.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.760
We won't be seeing
each other again anyway.

01:14:25.039 --> 01:14:26.920
What's that mean?

01:14:29.159 --> 01:14:31.159
I'm not going to the quarry anymore.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.319
They hired a guy I can't stand
from my town.

01:14:40.079 --> 01:14:42.880
One of those guys
who hangs out at that shitty bar?

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.479
How do you know?

01:14:48.039 --> 01:14:49.880
They attacked me too.

01:14:53.039 --> 01:14:54.479
I'm sorry.

01:14:57.079 --> 01:14:59.359
Is what they said true?

01:14:59.439 --> 01:15:00.760
What'd they say?

01:15:07.439 --> 01:15:08.880
Bullshit...

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:12.000
like the bullshit you say.

01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:18.279
I don't want to lose you.

01:15:18.359 --> 01:15:19.439
Neither do I.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.760
So we'll find a solution.

01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:24.680
Trust me.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.199
Let's head down.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.039
This is my land, my farm...

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.159
Tomato... Do you know tomto?

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.439
Not even you?

01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:15.199
How do you say it...

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:20.600
Let me... Now I let you introduce
the important part of my family.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.560
Never mind...

01:16:26.279 --> 01:16:27.600
This is my family.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.840
Prego... Please!

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.239
Sit down.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.640
- This is Carmella.
- Good evening.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.119
- Ninuzo.
- Ciao.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.640
Italy, Italy!

01:16:41.159 --> 01:16:45.279
- Grandpa, when is the game starting?
- Go get Uncle Nino.

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:48.079
Yes! Paolo Rossi!

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.399
Grandpa wants you.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.119
Hey, Dad.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.800
So you told your mom
about the other night?

01:17:05.159 --> 01:17:07.079
Me? No way!

01:17:07.159 --> 01:17:10.640
She called the doctor
because my cough is worrying her.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.359
Now she doesn't want me working.

01:17:14.439 --> 01:17:16.279
Know what pisses me off?

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.079
That you're both right.
I'm struggling, damn it.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.640
- That's why I...
- What?

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:28.840
We have 20 fairs before August,
that's a lot.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.840
I know, but I can handle it alone,
I know the ropes by now.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.279
At 16? All alone?

01:17:38.199 --> 01:17:41.600
You're right, but maybe...

01:17:43.119 --> 01:17:44.920
Gianni can help me.

01:17:45.439 --> 01:17:47.600
Why not? He's eager to work.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.960
Uncle Pietro says
he's one of the best workers.

01:17:50.319 --> 01:17:53.239
We'll take the three-wheeler
and get to it.

01:17:54.239 --> 01:17:57.479
After a week of rest,
you'll be as good as new.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.119
In the meantime,
you can watch all the games.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.600
Get me another.

01:18:10.359 --> 01:18:13.560
I'll decide after I talk to the doctor.
Okay?

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:15.680
Okay.

01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:25.399
Hooray Italy!

01:19:47.279 --> 01:19:51.479
<i>- Say it loud!</i>
<i>- Long live Saint Sebastian!</i>

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.279
<i>- Say it loud!</i>
<i>- Long live Saint Sebastian!</i>

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.880
<i>- Say it loud!</i>
<i>- Long live Saint Sebastian!</i>

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.720
Excuse me...

01:20:47.239 --> 01:20:49.079
can we get through?

01:20:49.159 --> 01:20:50.119
No.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.119
No cars, the saint is going by.

01:20:56.439 --> 01:20:58.079
- You're the firework guys?
- Yes.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.600
- Aren't you a little late?
- We hit traffic.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.199
I can't let you through now.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.760
We have to set off the fireworks.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.840
Quit insisting, you can't go through.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.039
Then I'll call my uncle Pietro,
the councilor will be upset...

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.119
Hey, they're the firework guys.

01:21:27.119 --> 01:21:28.279
They need to pass.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.600
I'll let them pass?

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.720
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.720
Place them close,
but not that close.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.119
- Now get me some fuses.
- Okay, but don't boss me around.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.000
- Am I your helper?
- Yeah, you're helping me.

01:22:02.479 --> 01:22:03.520
Knock it off!

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.119
Shut up!

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:07.319
- Get over here!
- Want to fight me?

01:22:11.479 --> 01:22:13.039
I'm not scared of you.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.720
- Do you give up?
- Yes.

01:22:16.039 --> 01:22:17.319
I give up.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.640
You can't beat me.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.039
Got it?

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.680
Knock it off.

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:31.680
You can't.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.800
Enough.

01:22:39.439 --> 01:22:41.640
To our first fair together, boss.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.439
Look how nice.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.039
Make me proud!

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.479
- Nino!
- What?

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.479
Come here.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.920
Wait here.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.680
- Did you like the fireworks?
- Sure did.

01:23:49.439 --> 01:23:51.520
I heard all about it.

01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:53.960
- Where's your pal?
- In there.

01:23:54.039 --> 01:23:55.239
Call him.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.239
Gianni, come here.

01:24:03.159 --> 01:24:04.399
Well?

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:05.640
Hello.

01:24:09.039 --> 01:24:10.800
The show went well.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.760
- Totò?
- What?

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.039
Come here.

01:24:15.359 --> 01:24:16.800
I'm crapping.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.520
The councilor called,

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.600
he said the whole town was staring
with their mouths wide open.

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:24.439
Good job.

01:24:25.319 --> 01:24:26.439
What?

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.560
- Have these champs drive you.
- Where?

01:24:30.479 --> 01:24:31.760
To color your hair.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.960
I dreamt that Italy would lose
unless I color my hair!

01:24:36.039 --> 01:24:37.439
Here's the money.

01:24:38.119 --> 01:24:40.800
Make sure the green, white,
and red are bright!

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.600
- Bring back the change.
- Bye.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.760
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.640
Where are they going?

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.680
You look like mummies!

01:24:55.439 --> 01:24:57.279
Ready?

01:24:57.359 --> 01:25:00.520
One, two, three, go!

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.800
Go, Uncle!

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.760
Go, Uncle!

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.840
- Totò, come here.
- Come on.

01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:28.600
No, I'm scared! I can't swim.

01:26:23.399 --> 01:26:26.119
- Totò, knock it off.
- It's okay.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.920
Totò, enough or I'll pop that ball.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.439
I will...

01:26:44.479 --> 01:26:45.680
Enough.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.279
Totò, enough with that ball.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.000
Be quiet, we can't hear.

01:26:54.079 --> 01:26:55.279
Fill it up.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.960
Change sides!

01:27:01.279 --> 01:27:02.720
To the right!

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.000
The defense needs to be
more aggressive.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.840
They're quick,
now that it's 2-2 they woke up.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.000
Quiet.

01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:19.199
Conti...

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.119
Conti's ready to kick.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.720
Conti...

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.319
Goal!

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.039
Honey!

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.720
Damn, I'm winded.

01:27:58.399 --> 01:27:59.560
Nino?

01:29:16.279 --> 01:29:17.840
Shitty luck.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.039
Now what?

01:29:20.119 --> 01:29:22.760
We wait till it stops,
we have no choice.

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.319
- Want a beer?
- Yes.

01:29:48.239 --> 01:29:49.680
A beer, thanks.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.119
Mom, I have some great news.

01:31:00.439 --> 01:31:02.880
I've been promoted,
I'll be working at fairs.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.279
Nino's dad isn't well,
he can't handle fireworks right now.

01:31:10.079 --> 01:31:12.960
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- I'm telling you now.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.359
What do you know about fireworks?

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.800
It's not that hard, I help Nino.

01:31:22.159 --> 01:31:24.319
Mom, they're amazing.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.760
You should see them!
Fireworks can express anything.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.319
Just the two of you?

01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:35.359
Yes.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.159
What's wrong?

01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:50.319
Nothing...

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.119
nothing.

01:32:06.439 --> 01:32:08.479
It's good, Aunt Carmela made it.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.640
Totò, do you like the pasta?

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.680
We should take your pal
hunting one day.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.960
- Sure, if he wants.
- Any time!

01:32:19.279 --> 01:32:20.720
I'll teach you to shoot.

01:32:21.039 --> 01:32:24.960
Last time Nino shot a rabbit,
it was this big, huge!

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:26.520
Mom!

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.079
Sorry, lost in thought.

01:32:37.159 --> 01:32:40.359
- Give Aunt Carmela a hand.
- No, I'm fine.

01:32:40.439 --> 01:32:43.319
Nobody makes pasta
like my sister-in-law's.

01:32:43.399 --> 01:32:48.039
None for me, I drank too much
last night, I'm still full.

01:32:49.159 --> 01:32:52.239
- My sister-in-law's a beauty.
- Hands off!

01:32:52.319 --> 01:32:54.000
She's too busy eating.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:55.960
Thanks.

01:32:56.359 --> 01:32:58.359
Happy birthday, Alfredo!

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.920
Happy birthday to my brother.

01:33:03.199 --> 01:33:06.640
- Sit and eat something.
- You're right, I will.

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.199
I'm always right.

01:33:08.279 --> 01:33:11.000
We have to agree
because it's your birthday.

01:33:11.079 --> 01:33:13.560
Leave the poor guy alone,
look at him.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.680
He may be 99...

01:33:16.119 --> 01:33:18.720
He's 49 not 99!

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:24.000
My friends told me the whole town
was gaping at the fireworks.

01:33:24.079 --> 01:33:25.079
Good job.

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:26.960
It's true.

01:33:27.039 --> 01:33:29.680
Carmela, bring out some wine, please.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.159
Here goes Uncle
with one of his speeches.

01:33:33.239 --> 01:33:35.479
Pietro, let me talk.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.079
Well, as we all know,
my son is an artist.

01:33:39.159 --> 01:33:41.079
- Thanks.
- Carry on, I'll be right back.

01:33:42.079 --> 01:33:47.159
But today I want to toast the person
who accompanies and works with him.

01:33:48.359 --> 01:33:49.560
Keep smoking...

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.920
Let me talk.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.760
This kid walked into our home
by chance and humbly...

01:33:55.079 --> 01:33:56.640
Atta boy, Gianni.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.640
And took my spot next to someone
who means the world to me.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.039
What's more...

01:34:02.119 --> 01:34:05.159
he also took my spot in something
that means the world to me,

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.239
my job.

01:34:08.319 --> 01:34:11.720
And you stole
one of my hardest workers!

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.439
Come on...

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.159
This year, the first toast
is for Gianni.

01:34:19.359 --> 01:34:21.239
All right, Gianni, welcome.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.119
Carmela, what's going on?

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.000
Nino, go see what your mom's up to.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.720
Mom?

01:34:33.359 --> 01:34:35.199
Mom, what's going on?

01:34:40.239 --> 01:34:43.840
I was bringing them out
but they slipped and broke.

01:34:45.039 --> 01:34:46.920
Don't worry, these things happen.

01:34:47.319 --> 01:34:49.079
No, Nino...

01:34:49.159 --> 01:34:52.680
These oddities should not happen,
we need to be careful.

01:34:55.079 --> 01:34:56.760
Don't hurt yourself.

01:35:14.119 --> 01:35:16.359
- Hi, Mom.
- Why the rush?

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.840
The fair's far away,
we have to leave now.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.720
I just came home to change,
Nino's waiting outside.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:41.960
Hello.

01:35:43.119 --> 01:35:44.039
Hi.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:55.239
Bye.

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.359
Wow...

01:36:01.439 --> 01:36:03.640
You look great in that shirt.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.680
Geez, they look like
a pair of girlfriends.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.319
But that job is a real godsend.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.640
If the pay is good,
he can get his own apartment.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.079
You know what?

01:36:26.159 --> 01:36:29.119
I'll call my friend
who works in public housing,

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:30.880
and pull some strings.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.319
Lina, where are you going?

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.279
Gianni!

01:37:19.239 --> 01:37:20.439
Hello?

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.119
I'm Gianni's mother.

01:37:26.239 --> 01:37:30.399
I wanted to thank you
for all you've done for my son.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.640
And that's why...

01:37:38.239 --> 01:37:40.159
it's only right that you know...

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:46.319
my son is the victim of gossip,
of maliciousness,

01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:51.159
nasty words said
to have a good laugh

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.199
but they can brand you forever,

01:37:56.159 --> 01:37:58.840
especially someone
who's too sensitive to react.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.560
Your son can be spared
from this gossip.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:11.279
A life full of joy
and fulfilment awaits him.

01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:21.600
Whereas Gianni... his life...

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.680
Get lost before I kill you.

01:42:24.359 --> 01:42:27.199
- Did you know?
- You think I didn't ask him already?

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.399
- Did you know or not?
- No.

01:42:29.479 --> 01:42:31.920
- You're full of shit!
- Shut up!

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.840
No, I won't shut up.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.000
He was alone with my son,
who knows what he did!?

01:42:37.079 --> 01:42:39.399
- Right, Nino?
- Get her out of here.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.000
Mom...

01:42:43.079 --> 01:42:45.119
We let the devil in.
Nino...

01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:47.119
- I said get out!
- No!

01:42:47.199 --> 01:42:49.720
I told you to get out of here!

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.920
Enough, get out!

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.680
- Nino, come here.
- Get out, now!

01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.520
Goddammit!

01:42:59.119 --> 01:43:00.560
Out!

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.600
Sit down.

01:43:09.159 --> 01:43:10.359
Sit.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Nino, tell us the truth.

01:43:18.079 --> 01:43:21.199
We can only help you
if you tell us what happened.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.439
There's still time
to straighten things out.

01:43:25.359 --> 01:43:27.960
What do you think happened?

01:43:29.359 --> 01:43:30.399
You really think...

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:34.039
We don't want to think anything,
but the facts are clear!

01:43:34.119 --> 01:43:36.840
That swine is what he is,
don't make me say it.

01:43:37.199 --> 01:43:38.760
Don't make me say it.

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:42.840
And you spent too much time with him,
everyone saw you.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.199
You and him, alone!

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.680
Dad, what can I say...

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.399
Gianni's a faggot?

01:43:50.479 --> 01:43:52.279
Whenever he saw a girl...

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:53.960
What the hell?!

01:43:54.039 --> 01:43:56.000
Don't bullshit me!

01:43:56.079 --> 01:43:58.159
I'm not bullshitting you, I swear.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.960
Calm down.

01:44:01.399 --> 01:44:02.600
Jesus...

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.159
Are you calm?

01:44:08.239 --> 01:44:09.960
He has to tell me...

01:44:16.199 --> 01:44:18.399
did something happen or not?

01:44:23.279 --> 01:44:25.039
Well, Nino?

01:44:26.039 --> 01:44:28.199
Go on, answer your father.

01:44:30.119 --> 01:44:33.960
If I'd known, I wouldn't have
even let him in the house.

01:44:35.079 --> 01:44:38.560
Because guys like him sicken me
more than they sicken you.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.640
Actually, I never want to see
his faggot face again!

01:44:46.199 --> 01:44:47.399
Okay?

01:44:49.039 --> 01:44:50.680
Happy now?

01:44:52.039 --> 01:44:53.760
Is the trial over?

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.800
Because I'm tired.

01:45:56.159 --> 01:45:57.479
Why?

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.880
Go to bed, Franco's expecting you
at the garage tomorrow.

01:47:28.119 --> 01:47:30.840
You had something to do
with what happened.

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.920
I'm your mother.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.239
Have you forgotten
you already ruined one boy's life?

01:47:46.319 --> 01:47:49.880
Now you want to ruin your friend too?

01:47:52.279 --> 01:47:57.199
And if you have a problem with it,
go back to reform school.

01:48:00.199 --> 01:48:01.520
You did it for you...

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.000
Because if people gossip about us,
he'll kick us out.

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.960
Who bought you that cheap dress?

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.159
Who gave you a home?
This shitty home...

01:48:13.239 --> 01:48:15.840
It sickens me and so do you.

01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:19.359
You can't even stand up.

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.720
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off.

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.600
You think they're laughing and smiling
at your friend's house now?

01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:30.319
You're way off, my love.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.319
If you care about that boy...

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.520
disappearing is the greatest gift
you can give him.

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.119
CERTIFIED FAGGOT

01:51:13.359 --> 01:51:15.520
- Hello?
- We're closing.

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.720
I wanted to buy the kid a coffee,
it'll be quick.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.000
The kid's working.

01:51:21.319 --> 01:51:23.920
I thought he said they were closing?

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.720
It's okay... Hello.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.439
Shall we get a coffee?

01:51:31.479 --> 01:51:32.479
Yes.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.239
Gianni, Gianni...

01:51:54.359 --> 01:51:57.119
So, shall we get a coffee?

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.199
Guys, look what's happening!

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.479
Shall we get a coffee or not?

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.479
What do you think?
Should we buy your pal a coffee?

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.720
Well...

01:52:36.359 --> 01:52:38.159
how many spoons of sugar?

01:52:40.359 --> 01:52:41.840
No, stop!

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.239
Stop, you bastards!

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.359
Bastards, go away!

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.760
Go away, now!

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.520
Go!

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.520
Bastards!

01:52:53.359 --> 01:52:54.479
Gianni?

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.039
Don't just fucking stand there!

01:53:02.119 --> 01:53:03.720
Help!

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.479
Help!

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:46.119
It got away.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.960
Be more careful.

01:53:49.439 --> 01:53:53.039
If you make too much noise,
the rabbit will hear you.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.479
Knock it off.

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.640
- Want to shoot, Totò?
- I'm scared.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.159
Scared of what?
Come here, I'll teach you.

01:54:21.239 --> 01:54:22.680
Give me your hand.

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:23.920
One here...

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.880
and one here.

01:54:27.359 --> 01:54:28.680
Do you see the rabbit?

01:54:29.159 --> 01:54:30.079
Yes.

01:54:32.359 --> 01:54:34.520
I got it, I got!

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.479
I got it!

01:54:37.199 --> 01:54:39.560
- Good job!
- Atta boy, Totò.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.079
I got it!

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:49.279
Uncle, look! I got it.

01:54:51.359 --> 01:54:53.119
I got it.

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.159
Things are back to normal now?
We'll play again?

01:54:57.399 --> 01:54:58.520
Of course.

01:55:03.439 --> 01:55:04.760
Gianni...

01:55:08.119 --> 01:55:09.960
Let's pray together.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.279
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

01:55:19.039 --> 01:55:23.520
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:55:24.359 --> 01:55:27.680
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.319
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:55:30.399 --> 01:55:34.640
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.399
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

01:55:38.479 --> 01:55:43.119
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.840
Come on, Nino,
tonight's the final game.

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.960
Let's get set up.

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.199
- Isabella, help me.
- Okay, Dad.

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.239
Hooray Italy!

01:56:14.239 --> 01:56:15.319
Here?

01:56:17.439 --> 01:56:19.920
Come on, get up!

01:56:20.359 --> 01:56:21.960
Grab some chairs.

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.720
Nino, move it.

01:56:36.359 --> 01:56:38.159
- What's wrong?
- Grab the table.

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.039
Totò, what are you doing?
Come here.

01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:49.760
Put that flag on the table.

01:56:50.079 --> 01:56:51.520
On top.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.039
Like that.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.840
Good.

01:57:00.199 --> 01:57:02.560
- What'll we do tonight?
- We'll win!

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.520
We'll win, that's right!

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.039
Thanks.

01:57:24.319 --> 01:57:26.960
Go, Paolo Rossi!

01:57:32.279 --> 01:57:34.159
- Where's Nino?
- Dunno.

01:57:41.279 --> 01:57:43.079
Grandpa, will we win?

01:57:43.159 --> 01:57:45.439
We sure will, don't worry.

01:57:46.119 --> 01:57:47.840
Move it, go!

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:50.800
Come on, go!

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.079
Be careful, go!

01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.640
Go!

01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:01.439
Hey, you're not watching the game?

01:58:02.079 --> 01:58:03.000
No.

01:58:07.479 --> 01:58:09.199
You don't have to be afraid of me.

01:58:11.199 --> 01:58:12.840
I'm not afraid of anything.

01:58:13.439 --> 01:58:14.359
That's bad...

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.880
if you're not afraid,
you'll go nowhere in life,

01:58:18.359 --> 01:58:20.560
or you'll end up under a train!

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.359
They think they know
everything about me...

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.000
your father...

01:58:40.159 --> 01:58:41.439
your mother...

01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:43.199
Isabella...

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:45.720
Uncle Pietro...

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:51.800
But they don't know a thing.

01:58:55.119 --> 01:58:58.600
Everything I do at night...
the girls, the friends...

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.439
the Americans...

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.319
and everything I don't do...

01:59:06.399 --> 01:59:08.840
Of course they make their assumptions,

01:59:11.159 --> 01:59:13.319
but will always have a doubt...

01:59:16.119 --> 01:59:18.159
and that isn't enough.

01:59:29.079 --> 01:59:31.840
Nino, whatever we do in secret

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.319
can continue for a hundred years.

01:59:37.399 --> 01:59:38.560
Bye.

01:59:42.039 --> 01:59:43.119
Bergomi...

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:45.920
The World Cup is over!

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.199
<i>Champions of the world!</i>
<i>Champions of the world!</i>

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:50.000
Champions of the world!

01:59:50.079 --> 01:59:54.119
<i>Italy won the final game</i>
<i>beating Germany 3-1...</i>

02:00:05.359 --> 02:00:08.840
Italy! Italy! Italy!

02:00:21.199 --> 02:00:22.399
Gianni?

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.920
Gianni?

02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.039
Nino! Come down!

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.000
Come here, come down!

02:00:45.159 --> 02:00:46.840
You're not going anywhere!

02:00:48.039 --> 02:00:49.640
Yes, you're right.

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:53.119
I'm not going anywhere.

02:03:05.399 --> 02:03:06.880
What's wrong?

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.399
For Toni and Giorgio

02:03:35.479 --> 02:03:38.039
who, in 1980 in Sicily, were killed
because they were in love.

02:03:39.439 --> 02:03:43.159
FIREWORKS

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.920
The first Arcigay Association was founded
in Palermo on December 9, 1980

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.079
also in the wake of the protests following
the death of the two young Sicilians.
