WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:02.721
I'm not so sure this
is a good gift for a 5 year old...

00:02.841 --> 00:05.102
*** It was the perfect gift for Toby.

00:06.477 --> 00:08.817
What do you say, Dustin?
Just put aside our differences?

00:08.854 --> 00:09.714
Not interested.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.110
Kenny!

00:11.230 --> 00:12.910
You'd better come get your wife.
Right now.

00:12.925 --> 00:13.923
There you go.

00:14.043 --> 00:15.595
Why don't you hang out with us, Kenny?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.272
Cocaine!

00:17.520 --> 00:19.055
Whoa, I'm not doing any coke.

00:19.175 --> 00:20.197
If you tell your wives,

00:20.219 --> 00:22.920
I swear to God, I will tell them
that you slept with those women.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.198
I'm 2-89.

00:24.229 --> 00:25.599
I can come up to your hotel room.

00:25.719 --> 00:27.375
You have family. We can't.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.812
- You don't have to worry about that.
It's fine. - It's too messed up.

00:29.932 --> 00:35.317

00:35.437 --> 00:37.134
Brennan, did you fart in here?

00:37.167 --> 00:40.002
- No. No, no.
- It stinks. You got a stinky ass.

00:40.122 --> 00:42.884
- No, I don't.
- You're a bad boy.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.634
Fuck me.

00:45.667 --> 00:48.857
Shit.

00:48.890 --> 00:50.259
[sighs]
I feel so much better.

00:50.379 --> 00:52.506
I went potty.
Are we ready?

00:52.547 --> 00:54.215
Yeah. I got everything
loaded in.

00:54.248 --> 00:55.823
- Kids are strapped together.
- Good.

00:55.864 --> 00:57.161
Got a bottle of water for you.

00:57.234 --> 00:59.202
OK. Honey, what is that
on your face?

00:59.235 --> 01:02.814
- Uhh... what?
- That mark. Is that a bruise?

01:02.847 --> 01:04.157
I don't know.
No... I don't know.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.067
- Did someone hit you?
- No...

01:06.100 --> 01:08.133
[chuckles]
No. Nobody hit me.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.073
Oh, OK. So I'm crazy?

01:10.106 --> 01:12.351
There's a bruise on your jaw.
Who did this to you?

01:12.384 --> 01:15.531
- Gene?
- It's nobo... it's nobody.

01:15.564 --> 01:18.183
Fine. I'll count to three.
One...

01:18.248 --> 01:21.016
- Two...
- Come on.

01:21.049 --> 01:23.457
- All right. It's OK...
- Two and a half...

01:23.490 --> 01:24.989
OK. Kenny Powers.

01:25.030 --> 01:26.432
- Kenny did this?
- [sighs] Yeah.

01:26.465 --> 01:27.603
- We were...
- Were you being bullied?

01:27.636 --> 01:28.874
No. We were singing
and rapping

01:28.907 --> 01:30.749
and we were playing...
doing a scene from <i>Rocky</i>

01:30.783 --> 01:31.982
and he... [clicks]
knocked me...

01:32.015 --> 01:34.422
You were doing
a scene from <i>Rocky?</i>

01:34.455 --> 01:36.135
- And he hit you?
- For... as a joke, yeah.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.490
No. I don't think so.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.195
- I'm gonna call April.
- No, no. Hey. No, no.

01:40.228 --> 01:41.595
- We'll clear this up.
- Do not talk to April.

01:41.636 --> 01:43.067
I will talk to April if I want.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.269
- Hey, I will handle this.
- I'd love to see that.

01:45.302 --> 01:46.270
- I can.
- Can you handle it?

01:46.303 --> 01:47.608
Yes, yes. I can handle it.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.852
- Now will you just let it go?
- OK.

01:49.917 --> 01:52.917
For now, I will let it go.
All right? Let's go.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.824
We have to stop at
the gas station.

01:55.857 --> 01:57.697
I'm all out of pads.

01:57.730 --> 02:04.989
[theme music playing]

02:05.022 --> 02:08.662
In most of nature, the alpha
is the strongest of the pack.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.863
Creature of immense strength,
large in size.

02:11.896 --> 02:13.599
A leader from birth.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.841
Hippos, bumble bees,
Wayans Brothers...

02:15.874 --> 02:18.108
Most of the time, they just look
to the biggest amongst them.

02:18.141 --> 02:20.476
But not all alphas are born,
children.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.286
Some animals become great.

02:22.319 --> 02:25.183
They use they mind,
form respect

02:25.256 --> 02:26.759
and build alliances.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.592
Your father has recently
used this technique

02:28.625 --> 02:29.897
to stunning effect.

02:29.930 --> 02:33.193
It is now your turn, my son.
Feed his desires.

02:33.234 --> 02:37.971
Give Dakota this
chicken chow mein.

02:38.004 --> 02:38.909
- [growling]
- There you go.

02:38.942 --> 02:41.449
Don't be scared, Toby.
No fear.

02:41.482 --> 02:43.619
You are his master.

02:43.652 --> 02:45.684
Toby, goddammit, he ain't
gonna be able to reach that.

02:45.725 --> 02:49.063
And that's not even feeding him.
You're cock teasing him.

02:49.096 --> 02:50.559
[announcer]
It's the Ultimate <i>Sports Sesh</i>

02:50.600 --> 02:51.805
- Double Dog Challenge.
- [audience chanting]

02:51.833 --> 02:53.064
And right now it looks like
it's come down

02:53.097 --> 02:54.568
to a two man race.

02:54.601 --> 02:56.504
And now it's the
breakfast of champions.

02:56.537 --> 02:57.641
The apple pie, whipped cream,

02:57.674 --> 02:59.780
followed by downing
a can of beer.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.478
- [shouting]
- Here comes Kenny Powers

03:01.511 --> 03:03.247
- through the birth canal.
- [audience cheering]

03:03.288 --> 03:06.385
It looks like it's gonna be
Jed Forney and Guy Young

03:06.426 --> 03:08.322
in a dead heat around
the baseball bat spin.

03:08.355 --> 03:12.395
Powers is bibbing up.
Jimmy Clay's with a can of beer.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.565
Now atop the balance beam,

03:14.598 --> 03:17.574
duel's underway
and down goes Guy Young.

03:17.607 --> 03:19.943
Jed Forney on his way
to the pyramid.

03:19.976 --> 03:23.575
Three steps the top.
Two, one. He's there.

03:23.616 --> 03:25.914
- He reaches for the flag.
- [bell dinging]

03:25.955 --> 03:27.283
- He's won.
- Yeah!

03:27.324 --> 03:30.096
- [cheering]
- [announcer] Jed Forney,

03:30.129 --> 03:32.800
the winner of
the Ultimate <i>Sports Sesh</i>

03:32.833 --> 03:35.432
Double Dog Challenge.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.767
Good race, man.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.335
[announcer] We'll be back
with more <i>Sports Sesh</i>

03:39.368 --> 03:41.704
right after this.

03:41.737 --> 03:43.608
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

03:43.641 --> 03:44.808
What the fuck were you
thinking about?

03:44.841 --> 03:46.144
How you gonna beat Guy Young
on his own show?

03:46.177 --> 03:48.944
Fuck. So stupid.

03:48.985 --> 03:51.281
- Just a idiot.
- You guys are hilarious.

03:51.353 --> 03:53.819
Do you really think Guy Young's
gonna be upset with you

03:53.852 --> 03:55.061
because you beat him on a silly
little obstacle course?

03:55.094 --> 03:56.957
- You don't know Guy Young.
- Uh, excuse me.

03:56.998 --> 03:58.123
I played baseball
with the motherfucker.

03:58.164 --> 04:00.593
- I think I know Guy Young.
- This ain't baseball.

04:00.626 --> 04:01.657
[Jed] That was a long time ago,
Kenny.

04:01.698 --> 04:03.496
Guy's the sorest loser there is.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.096
Throws a damn fit.

04:05.129 --> 04:06.896
Ask Dontel
if you don't believe me.

04:06.929 --> 04:08.568
Oh, an ex-embittered employee.

04:08.601 --> 04:10.104
I'm sure he's a great
judge of character.

04:10.137 --> 04:12.905
Well, ask Rodney.
He ain't no trash talker.

04:12.938 --> 04:13.977
- Tell him.
- Tell him, Rodney.

04:14.010 --> 04:15.673
- He can be fucked up.
- Yeah?

04:15.706 --> 04:18.841
Come on, man. You and I
are show mates, dude.

04:18.914 --> 04:21.278
I got your back. I'll make sure
nobody fucks with you.

04:21.310 --> 04:25.548
Thanks, Kenny.
That means a lot.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.883
- KP.
- Saved you a seat, homeboy.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.248
- [both laugh]
- KP has found his niche.

04:30.281 --> 04:34.213
He is hysterical out there.
They're loving you, my man.

04:34.246 --> 04:35.582
Oh yeah, dog.
I'm loving my stage charisma.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.390
- [chuckles]
- Well, I like it too.

04:37.455 --> 04:38.918
I like it too.
I'm glad you're here, KP.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.127
I don't wanna sound weird, Guy.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.264
But, I mean, you're just...

04:43.297 --> 04:45.065
...fastly becoming...

04:45.098 --> 04:46.730
...my very best friend, dude.

04:46.770 --> 04:48.697
I don't just throw that around.

04:48.738 --> 04:51.170
You know,
I had a very best friend.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.739
He passed away suddenly.
Overdose of cocaine.

04:53.772 --> 04:55.476
He was all alone by himself
in his apartment.

04:55.509 --> 04:58.614
After my experiences
with Shane Dog,

04:58.647 --> 05:00.054
I, uh...

05:00.087 --> 05:02.316
I never thought I'd have a very
best friend like him again.

05:02.349 --> 05:03.515
Best friends
are very cool to be.

05:03.556 --> 05:06.125
Pff. Fucking very best friends
are fucking dope to be.

05:06.158 --> 05:07.125
[both laugh]

05:07.158 --> 05:08.629
What are you doing
this weekend?

05:08.662 --> 05:10.396
Me? I need to check
my Palm Pilot.

05:10.429 --> 05:11.364
But I think I'm just chilling.

05:11.397 --> 05:13.026
Yeah? I'm hosting
a charity event.

05:13.059 --> 05:14.825
It's the Dragon Boat Classic.

05:14.858 --> 05:16.791
Oh, Dragon Boat.

05:16.832 --> 05:19.569
That sounds like that might be
Asian in origin, am I correct?

05:19.602 --> 05:21.468
- Ah, so it is.
- [laughs]

05:21.509 --> 05:23.908
So what do you say, you wanna go
into battle with me, KP, huh?

05:23.941 --> 05:25.508
You wanna be on my row team?

05:25.541 --> 05:26.811
Because of my martial arts
training,

05:26.844 --> 05:28.975
my muscles are tuned to excel
at oriental activities.

05:29.009 --> 05:30.007
How much does it pay?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.207
[laughing]
No, we don't get paid.

05:31.279 --> 05:32.710
It's charity work, Kenny.

05:32.743 --> 05:34.783
All you gotta do is pick
the charity of your choice

05:34.816 --> 05:35.983
and we're good to go.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.247
Look, I'm not gonna be crazy,
all right.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.248
I'll take this friendship slow

05:38.281 --> 05:40.891
but you've really
turned my life around.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.291
The least I can do is join you
in this charitable battle.

05:43.324 --> 05:44.291
[pounds table] I love it.

05:44.324 --> 05:45.795
OK. Come on.

05:45.828 --> 05:50.699
[yells] Get back,
back, back, back, back.

05:50.732 --> 05:55.340
Ten seconds to blast-off.

05:55.373 --> 05:58.275
It's gonna be so awesome.

05:58.308 --> 06:00.073
- [hip-hop music playing]
- Stevie.

06:00.106 --> 06:01.408
This isn't play time.

06:01.441 --> 06:05.279
I'd love to discuss something
with you, ASAP.

06:05.312 --> 06:07.047
I need you to find me
a charity that I can represent

06:07.080 --> 06:09.017
for this goddamn Dragon Boat
shit I got going on.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.587
- [glass breaking]
- Shut up!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.389
- The fuck?
- Sorry about my kids.

06:12.422 --> 06:15.295
I just realized
that I cannot control them.

06:15.328 --> 06:16.694
Stevie, I need you to
fucking focus up, all right?

06:16.727 --> 06:18.534
I just need you to come up
with a goddamn good cause

06:18.567 --> 06:20.168
I can put my name on.
I need something fucking dope

06:20.201 --> 06:21.433
and I need it quick.

06:21.474 --> 06:22.939
And I know you got
a one track mind right now

06:22.972 --> 06:24.181
so don't be
coming at me with some

06:24.214 --> 06:25.613
"Save the Limp Dick Foundation."

06:25.646 --> 06:26.909
Ah. That was what
I was gonna say.

06:26.950 --> 06:29.214
"Save the Limp Dick."
Speaking of,

06:29.247 --> 06:30.414
I went to
the dick doctor today,

06:30.455 --> 06:35.260
and he said that my problem
is 100 percent mental.

06:35.293 --> 06:36.764
So, that's a positive, right?

06:36.797 --> 06:39.834
No! Obviously not because
if it was physical

06:39.898 --> 06:41.000
you could unclog a tube

06:41.033 --> 06:43.298
and then I can get back
to everyday love making.

06:43.339 --> 06:45.419
Scientifically speaking
what's probably going on here

06:45.436 --> 06:47.572
with the fucking
downstairs business is

06:47.612 --> 06:49.676
your boner muscles are looking
at yourself in the mirror

06:49.709 --> 06:51.950
and they're saying, "Jesus
Christ, there's no way in hell

06:51.982 --> 06:54.616
that any woman is ever
gonna fucking let me pump her."

06:54.657 --> 06:56.258
That makes sense, Kenny

06:56.291 --> 06:57.859
I mean, you put zero
to no effort

06:57.892 --> 06:59.290
into your personal appearance.

06:59.330 --> 07:01.361
I mean, maybe try spending more
than six bucks on a haircut.

07:01.394 --> 07:04.232
You know? Buy shirts that aren't
fucking plum colored.

07:04.265 --> 07:05.232
You don't like plum?

07:05.265 --> 07:07.266
Let the dick guide you,
all right?

07:07.300 --> 07:08.804
The dick knows
what it wants to wear.

07:08.837 --> 07:11.511
And right now,
the dick wants to be a hunk.

07:11.544 --> 07:13.279
New clothes.
New wardrobe. New Stevie.

07:13.312 --> 07:14.183
Mm-hmm.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.112
The dick wants to be a hunk.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.249
[wolf growls, barks]

07:17.282 --> 07:19.217
Aw, yeah. That's right.

07:19.258 --> 07:21.458
Look at you sexy motherfuckers.

07:21.491 --> 07:23.490
Oh. So sweaty, so raw, so real.

07:23.523 --> 07:25.425
Aw, yeah. Dutch angles.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.192
Rule of thirds up in here.

07:27.225 --> 07:30.926
Pa-pow. That's some <i>Amores Perros</i>
right there, motherfucker.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.262
I want y'all to pretend
that you're digging up

07:33.303 --> 07:34.799
the ancient city of El Dorado.

07:34.832 --> 07:36.505
And once you find
these jewels and treasures

07:36.538 --> 07:38.010
it will save your
entire village.

07:38.043 --> 07:39.539
- Kenny.
- Hey, wheel barrow one.

07:39.580 --> 07:42.646
Pretend like there's a
Chupacabra chasing your ass.

07:42.686 --> 07:44.581
- There you go, faster.
- [April] Baby.

07:44.614 --> 07:48.652
Has Gene and Tel
been weird to you at all?

07:48.685 --> 07:51.092
Nah, just boring as usual.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.987
I found out that
they had spaghetti night

07:54.028 --> 07:56.662
- without us on Wednesday.
- How could they do that?

07:56.695 --> 07:58.102
I mean, we practically
invented spaghetti night.

07:58.135 --> 08:00.165
Viv let it slip.

08:00.199 --> 08:03.038
I swear something's
going on with them.

08:03.071 --> 08:04.904
Well, you know,
I didn't wanna say anything

08:04.946 --> 08:07.747
but Gene has been fibbing
like a motherfucker lately.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.250
Like what?

08:09.283 --> 08:10.977
Like making up lies about
people's relationships.

08:11.018 --> 08:12.113
Just kind of out of the blue.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.353
With, like,
nothing to base it on.

08:13.386 --> 08:15.018
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, like the other day

08:15.051 --> 08:17.187
he was coming to me
talking about Tel.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.596
Saying how Tel's, like,
been going online

08:19.661 --> 08:21.631
doing Chatroulette
trying to get dick sucks.

08:21.664 --> 08:23.000
- [gasps]
- And it's like, Tel?

08:23.033 --> 08:24.231
He like, loves his wife

08:24.272 --> 08:25.735
and he doesn't even know
how to use Chatroulette.

08:25.768 --> 08:27.872
That makes me just question,
like, maybe Gene's

08:27.905 --> 08:29.271
not that happy
in his own marriage.

08:29.304 --> 08:31.806
- Well, he's... he's with Dixie.
- Gross [scoffs]

08:31.839 --> 08:36.182
You know what? I think that she was very
judgy about my drinking at the waterpark.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.184
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:38.217 --> 08:40.154
- I just figured it out.
- What?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.489
I bet, because
you were drinking,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.822
you probably somehow
offended her

08:44.856 --> 08:46.116
and now she's trying to
turn that shit against you.

08:46.157 --> 08:47.252
- Shit.
- Isolate us out

08:47.285 --> 08:48.453
in the goddamn neighborhood
and pull this.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.127
- I knew it. Fuck them?
- Fuck them.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.598
- Yeah.
- Look at all the wonderful things

08:51.631 --> 08:53.629
happening for us.
We're rich as fuck.

08:53.662 --> 08:55.430
We got a goddamn
army of workers here.

08:55.503 --> 08:56.998
We're happier than
we've ever been, right?

08:57.032 --> 08:59.440
- Mm-hmm.
- You see this one right here?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.210
You see that little broach
on TT's neck there?

09:01.243 --> 09:02.975
That used to belong to your
great-grandmother.

09:03.008 --> 09:04.608
I used it as an incentive
yesterday for the workers

09:04.641 --> 09:07.176
to see who could do the
best work and he won.

09:07.217 --> 09:10.785
- TT dug the most.
- [sighs]

09:10.818 --> 09:17.457
[classical music]

09:17.491 --> 09:20.055
I'm thinking I can...
if I get enough loft

09:20.088 --> 09:23.034
- I can get it over that bunker.
- It looks...if you can do the bounce.

09:23.099 --> 09:27.465
[heavy metal music]

09:27.498 --> 09:29.305
[music stops]

09:29.338 --> 09:31.041
What's the word, mean Gene?

09:31.074 --> 09:32.905
How's that jaw feeling,
slugger?

09:32.938 --> 09:35.273
You didn't punch me that hard
so it doesn't hurt that bad.

09:35.306 --> 09:38.510
[chuckles]
Fucking pussy.

09:38.543 --> 09:40.140
Look, I know shit got
out of hand the other night.

09:40.173 --> 09:41.340
We all got a little crazy.

09:41.413 --> 09:44.748
Drugs, sex, incest.

09:44.781 --> 09:46.578
All right. Let's just relive
the whole evening, Tel.

09:46.611 --> 09:48.080
I was there, motherfucker.
All right?

09:48.113 --> 09:49.247
I know what happened.
Guess what?

09:49.280 --> 09:51.447
I also saw some suspicious
and provocative

09:51.480 --> 09:53.182
behaviors on your half, too.

09:53.215 --> 09:54.781
And I could talk about
those if I wanted to.

09:54.814 --> 09:57.389
[scoffs] What are you talking about, man?
We didn't do anything.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.253
Yeah. I know.
That's what I'm saying, dude.

09:59.286 --> 10:01.326
Neither did I.
No one did anything.

10:01.359 --> 10:02.463
- Fine.
- So let's just drop it.

10:02.496 --> 10:03.592
- Good.
- I know you and Dixie

10:03.633 --> 10:05.329
have been having
little spaghetti nights

10:05.362 --> 10:07.200
and not inviting us.
Yeah. So what.

10:07.233 --> 10:10.166
I don't give a fuck. All right?
But you hurt April's feelings.

10:10.199 --> 10:11.798
And that shit
don't fly with me.

10:11.839 --> 10:15.541
Let's leave the spouses
out of it. Do you hear me?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.740
- OK.
- Leave the fucking spouses out if it!

10:17.774 --> 10:19.042
All right, dude.
Chill.

10:19.075 --> 10:21.840
- Now you, Tel.
- I'm sorry.

10:21.873 --> 10:24.101
You got any fucking change?
Where's your fucking change at?

10:24.142 --> 10:25.941
- What do you need change for?
- I'm trying to get a pink lemonade

10:25.974 --> 10:28.045
in this motherfucker. Give me
your money, you guys got change?

10:28.078 --> 10:29.444
[Gene]
No. I got no money on me.

10:29.477 --> 10:32.545
I'll fucking deport you
back to Mexico city.

10:32.578 --> 10:34.311
How will you guys play golf
without a fucking ball?

10:34.344 --> 10:35.807
Come on.

10:35.847 --> 10:40.351
I never... have been so
disgusted by two men's behavior.

10:40.416 --> 10:46.393
Leave the spouses out of it,
you fucking bullies.

10:46.427 --> 10:48.058
Which clubs are yours, Gene?
These red ones?

10:48.090 --> 10:50.329
[Gene] Yeah, those are mine.
That's my TaylorMades.

10:50.362 --> 10:52.329
- Ho-ho!
- [Tel] Hey.

10:52.394 --> 10:58.797
[rap music]

10:58.830 --> 11:02.008
Goddamn, dude. Why you taking me
onto the set of <i>City of God,</i> man?

11:02.041 --> 11:03.377
This place isn't gentrified
for a reason.

11:03.410 --> 11:05.146
Hold on. I think
you're gonna like this.

11:05.179 --> 11:07.211
I better like it. The Dragon
Boat race is almost here.

11:07.252 --> 11:10.679
It's right here.
Check it out.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.751
[Kenny] What the hell is this?

11:11.784 --> 11:13.119
All these kids
have AIDS or something?

11:13.184 --> 11:16.056
No. They're poor.
You keep them off the hood

11:16.089 --> 11:17.793
by teaching them baseball.

11:17.826 --> 11:20.164
Little black kids playing sports
isn't a hot button issue.

11:20.197 --> 11:22.599
No one's gonna give a fuck about
this at the Dragon Boat race.

11:22.632 --> 11:24.535
Man, I'm going up against
some heavy hitters, dude.

11:24.568 --> 11:27.268
AIDS. Fucking rainforests.
Cystic Fibrosis.

11:27.302 --> 11:30.069
Don't underestimate the cause.
It's got a lot of potential.

11:30.110 --> 11:32.807
Who knows. One of these kids
could be the next Babe Ruth.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.512
Well, I wanted the next
Rock Hudson or Liberace.

11:35.545 --> 11:38.478
Jesus Christ.
Guy Young has AIDS!

11:38.519 --> 11:40.781
Why can't I get AIDS?!
I want fucking AIDS!

11:40.814 --> 11:42.655
Look, AIDS is harder to get
than you think.

11:42.688 --> 11:45.563
Every celebrity
with a butthole wants AIDS.

11:45.596 --> 11:47.563
But this is not the 1980's.

11:47.596 --> 11:50.499
You can't just sit
on a toilet seat and get AIDS.

11:50.532 --> 11:52.898
This, though,
everyone loves poor black kids.

11:52.939 --> 11:55.767
<i>Different Strokes,</i>
<i>Dangerous Minds,</i> Urkel.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.967
White guilt, man.
Get with the program.

11:58.001 --> 12:00.839
No, I know. Box office returns
on <i>Blindside</i> were huge.

12:00.873 --> 12:05.844
I'm highly disappointed in your
efforts here but I will make it work.

12:05.878 --> 12:08.548
Sorry. I hate when
I disappoint you, Kenny.

12:08.581 --> 12:12.151
I'm just all torn up about
my fucking dick and balls.

12:12.216 --> 12:13.416
Well, homes. Look, man,

12:13.456 --> 12:14.856
it's gonna take more
than one polo shirt

12:14.889 --> 12:16.154
to change your confidence,
all right?

12:16.194 --> 12:18.824
Dude, you're being very nerdy
with your clothes picking.

12:18.857 --> 12:20.622
No wonder your dick's
not getting hard, dude.

12:20.663 --> 12:21.926
Probably can't even breathe
in there.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.263
Polyester pleats.
You fucking jackass.

12:24.296 --> 12:25.831
I'm sorry I failed you.

12:25.864 --> 12:27.031
The only thing
that would make me happy

12:27.064 --> 12:28.871
is if all these kids had AIDS.

12:28.904 --> 12:38.408
[rock music]

12:38.449 --> 12:40.479
[exhales]

12:40.512 --> 12:41.583
And to think,

12:41.616 --> 12:43.320
you were sweating
spaghetti and meatballs

12:43.353 --> 12:45.618
with Gene and Dixie and now
look at your fine ass.

12:45.659 --> 12:46.691
- [giggles]
- This is upper-class.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.259
- This is the elite.
- OK.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.530
We need to make sure they
realize that we are one of them.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.826
- I need your linguistics to be on point.
- OK. Mm-hmm.

12:52.859 --> 12:57.199
Talk about finances. Talk about
ancient affairs. Industrialism.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.633
I need you to be the fucking Bill
O'Reilly with tits in there.

12:59.664 --> 13:01.136
- OK.
- OK?

13:01.169 --> 13:05.779
Do you have a napkin on you?

13:05.812 --> 13:09.145
Step forward.

13:09.178 --> 13:10.880
Now you're ready to sizzle.

13:10.913 --> 13:22.190
Let's be elite.

13:22.223 --> 13:24.789
- [drumming stops]
- [clinking glass]

13:24.822 --> 13:27.831
- Well, hello, everybody.
- He looks like fucking Neo, doesn't he?

13:27.864 --> 13:30.097
- He does. [laughs]
- It's fucking cool.

13:30.129 --> 13:34.770
It has been said that the Dragon Boat
racers of old were so competitive

13:34.803 --> 13:37.377
that they would strike
each other with bamboo

13:37.410 --> 13:40.473
in order to drown each other,

13:40.514 --> 13:46.285
for the soul purpose of claiming
victory for the mighty dragon deity.

13:46.318 --> 13:49.495
I, along with many
of my dear friends here...

13:49.528 --> 13:50.863
I see Kenny P in the house.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.495
- Hey.
- [chuckles]

13:53.528 --> 13:57.199
We... we're honored to be
manning this beautiful vessel

13:57.232 --> 13:58.670
for our respective charities.

13:58.703 --> 14:01.899
Mine being Guy's AIDS.
What's yours again, KP?

14:01.932 --> 14:03.897
Just Little Black Kids.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.136
[Guy] Little Black Kids.

14:06.169 --> 14:07.536
- And now,
- [indistinct whisper]

14:07.569 --> 14:09.963
let's officially
get the festivities started.

14:10.004 --> 14:12.499
Priest Shen-Quan.
Did I say that correctly?

14:12.540 --> 14:18.113
Shen-Quan? Will be conducting
the "Awakening of the Dragon."

14:18.146 --> 14:21.988
[chanting in foreign language]

14:22.021 --> 14:24.189
[mumbles along]

14:24.222 --> 14:28.002
[bell ringing]

14:28.035 --> 14:34.413
- The bell is for symbolisms.
- Oh.

14:34.446 --> 14:36.478
- What he said. Let's party!
- [man] Yeah!

14:36.511 --> 14:38.217
[laughing and cheering]

14:38.250 --> 14:47.217
- [drums beating]
- [Asian pop music]

14:47.250 --> 14:49.888
- April. What a pleasure.
- So flattering.

14:49.921 --> 14:51.286
- [laughter]
- So beautiful.

14:51.319 --> 14:52.790
- Thank you.
- Just gorgeous.

14:52.823 --> 14:54.992
April, what do you say
us girls go get a drink?

14:55.025 --> 14:56.994
- Oh, OK. Yes.
- Leave these two to it.

14:57.027 --> 14:58.731
[Kenny] OK.

14:58.764 --> 15:03.030
Wow. She is stunning, Kenny. How'd
you land somebody like that?

15:03.063 --> 15:05.698
Ah, I fucked with her head
for a while. Never fails.

15:05.731 --> 15:07.897
- I love it.
- Yours is pretty ravishing, as well.

15:07.930 --> 15:09.569
She looks like that lady
from <i>Transformers.</i>

15:09.602 --> 15:11.506
I met her in a bathroom stall.

15:11.539 --> 15:13.169
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15:13.202 --> 15:14.808
I guess we're both
a couple of cocksman, huh?

15:14.841 --> 15:16.438
- Hell yeah.
- Holla.

15:16.471 --> 15:17.540
- Holla.
- Hey, oh.

15:17.573 --> 15:20.134
- There he is.
- Oh boy.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.967
Look who's coming.
My goodness.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.470
- Salt and pepper's here.
- [laughter]

15:24.504 --> 15:25.870
- How you doing?
- How are you, buddy?

15:25.911 --> 15:27.509
- Good, good, good.
- What's the word?

15:27.542 --> 15:28.939
- [woman] Hi.
- Hello, Cheryl. How are you?

15:28.972 --> 15:31.474
Hey, my wife here brought
her famous peach cobbler.

15:31.507 --> 15:35.345
Yes, I did. I told you last time
we met I'd bring you some.

15:35.378 --> 15:38.112
I remember, Cheryl. And I'm
looking forward to that cobbler.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.077
Why don't you go put it over there
by the other baked confections.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.548
Then I'm gonna dive into it
a little later.

15:41.581 --> 15:43.442
- I'll be there in a second.
- Wonderful to see you, baby.

15:43.483 --> 15:46.786
Well, I told her
I'd take her down to by water

15:46.819 --> 15:48.252
and whisper sweet nothings
into her ear.

15:48.284 --> 15:50.522
- Whoo.
- [laughing]

15:50.555 --> 15:51.785
If I get lucky, she might...

15:51.818 --> 15:53.455
drop a digit in my bunghole.

15:53.489 --> 15:54.920
- You're talking ass-play?
- Butthole.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.423
- Oh, man.
- If we're in the water, don't even bother.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.055
- [laughter]
- That means something's happening.

15:59.095 --> 16:01.031
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- Get after it.

16:01.064 --> 16:02.599
[laughing]

16:02.632 --> 16:05.935
Ah, Jed Forney.
Ugh, God.

16:05.968 --> 16:07.670
- [sighs]
- Ah, Forney's all right.

16:07.703 --> 16:11.300
No, he's not, man. The motherfucking
guy's lame and he's dull.

16:11.333 --> 16:14.167
And he's an ass-kiss.
And his wife brings in cobbler?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.333
Like, I got Sweet Lady Jane
flown in from LA.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.532
You know? I'm not gonna eat
that bullshit cobbler.

16:18.565 --> 16:20.267
No, I know. It's like,
in Tupperware.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.539
The presentation
is obviously not up to snuff.

16:22.604 --> 16:23.876
She reminds me
of my little brother.

16:23.909 --> 16:25.974
- What does that mean?
- His wife, man.

16:26.014 --> 16:29.717
Looks like a boy. With her
little short hair and no tits

16:29.750 --> 16:31.782
and a flat ass
and little boy legs.

16:31.815 --> 16:35.821
And short little
fucking... boy fingers.

16:35.854 --> 16:37.850
Like a little
Dennis the Menace.

16:37.883 --> 16:40.755
[Guy] Disgusting, man. I don't even
wanna think about them having sex.

16:40.788 --> 16:42.692
All right. I'm gonna have to hobnob
with some of the big donors.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.364
- OK, sure.
- I'll catch you later, baby.

16:44.397 --> 16:46.660
All right? Champion.
Thank you for coming.

16:46.701 --> 16:53.669
Mos def, mos def.

16:53.702 --> 16:56.509
Kemosabe.
You're showing brain.

16:56.542 --> 17:02.072
Your scrotum and some of your testicles
are leaking out of your diaper there.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.612
[Stevie] Hello, everyone and
welcome to Kenny Powers'

17:05.652 --> 17:09.820
Extra Innings After School
Baseball Class.

17:09.854 --> 17:14.789
And now, here is Kenny Powers.

17:14.829 --> 17:20.099
[clapping]

17:20.133 --> 17:22.367
Whoa. Whooo.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.569
Word.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.607
- Fresh.
- Dope.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.036
- Pay-puh.
- Jams.

17:28.069 --> 17:30.537
- Badonkadonks.
- Street talk.

17:30.570 --> 17:33.138
That's what we're here for
today, you guys.

17:33.179 --> 17:34.379
I know what you guys
are thinking.

17:34.412 --> 17:36.885
"Who the hell this cracker
think he is?"

17:36.918 --> 17:39.782
"Walking up in here,
this honkey motherfucker."

17:39.823 --> 17:41.485
Well, don't be thinking
that kind of stuff, guys.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.051
Don't be racist.

17:43.084 --> 17:46.687
Because this cracker-ass
honkey motherfucker...

17:46.720 --> 17:49.287
...from this day forward
is now the face of you guys.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.961
I've chosen to battle
on your behalf

17:52.994 --> 17:55.999
in the celebrity charity
Dragon Boat race.

17:56.032 --> 17:58.031
There's gonna be other
causes that,

17:58.065 --> 18:00.266
frankly are way more
interesting than you guys.

18:00.306 --> 18:03.170
Things like Lyme's disease
and cleft palates

18:03.203 --> 18:05.106
and war torn countries
and rainforests.

18:05.139 --> 18:07.148
Breast cancer... for teens.

18:07.181 --> 18:08.749
But don't let that scare you.

18:08.782 --> 18:11.056
Because I'm gonna make a promise
to each and every one of you

18:11.089 --> 18:12.287
that when I got out there

18:12.320 --> 18:15.451
- I will win.
- Belee dat.

18:15.484 --> 18:16.890
[Kenny] Steven, I got this, OK?

18:16.923 --> 18:19.627
I'm here to amend for the
atrocities of my ancestors.

18:19.660 --> 18:23.425
You think I'm proud to come from a fucking
powdered wig wooden teeth motherfucker?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.590
Fucking George Washington
didn't do shit.

18:25.623 --> 18:28.995
He can suck my fucking dick.
I fucking hate that faggot.

18:29.028 --> 18:30.628
That's street talk, y'all.

18:30.661 --> 18:32.062
Hope y'all can get
where we're coming from.

18:32.095 --> 18:34.332
- [Stevie] We're keeping this real.
- So look.

18:34.365 --> 18:36.929
I'm looking around at this fucking
baseball park and it sucks. I get it, man.

18:36.962 --> 18:39.169
There's a goddamn swamp
in the outfield.

18:39.202 --> 18:42.105
There's a used tampon
stuck to second base.

18:42.138 --> 18:45.307
But now that I'm your leader,
all that shit's about to change.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.749
I'll crush those other charities
in the Dragon Boat race

18:47.782 --> 18:49.950
and when I do I will
bring back that skrilla.

18:49.983 --> 18:52.116
That cash money.
And I'll spend it here.

18:52.149 --> 18:53.514
We getting a goddamn
brand new couch.

18:53.548 --> 18:55.216
We're gonna change your lives.

18:55.249 --> 18:58.454
And I have a feeling
that right now,

18:58.487 --> 19:00.488
- the change has begun.
- Hallelujah.

19:00.553 --> 19:04.429
Get ready for victory.
You're with a champion now.

19:04.462 --> 19:07.531
<i>What are you, an audience</i>
<i>or an oil painting?</i>

19:07.564 --> 19:09.500
[TV chatter]

19:09.533 --> 19:12.539
Seriously? Gene and Dixie
are having guests over again.

19:12.572 --> 19:15.201
I don't get it.
What is their deal?

19:15.234 --> 19:17.369
I have to go over there and see
what the problem is. I do.

19:17.410 --> 19:20.009
April, don't do it. You're
playing right into their hands.

19:20.042 --> 19:21.841
This is the exact sort of
reaction they're hoping for.

19:21.874 --> 19:24.680
Well, if they have an issue, Kenny,
then they need to fucking spill it.

19:24.713 --> 19:26.345
Yeah. They've ruffled
your feathers, I know.

19:26.385 --> 19:27.785
Will you please go with me?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.985
You sure you just don't wanna
send a text or an email?

19:30.050 --> 19:31.016
[April] No.
That's not gonna work.

19:31.057 --> 19:32.152
Just go over in person.

19:32.185 --> 19:34.088
Kenny, I'm not playing around.

19:34.121 --> 19:36.289
[sighs]

19:36.330 --> 19:37.994
There he is.
Here he comes.

19:38.027 --> 19:40.026
- Here it is.
- Tel cut the cheese.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.233
[laughter]

19:42.266 --> 19:45.830
- Hi. Hi, Dixie.
- Whoa. Uh, hello.

19:45.903 --> 19:47.195
- Hello.
- Um, hi, everybody.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.234
- This won't take long.
- Sure.

19:48.268 --> 19:50.236
Um, how have your
two dinner parties been

19:50.269 --> 19:51.701
in the last two weeks?

19:51.734 --> 19:53.941
I've just... I've seen
everybody come over here.

19:53.974 --> 19:57.044
I don't think I got the invitation.
I think it got lost in spam.

19:57.077 --> 19:58.707
Sorry, April. I don't know if
this is a joke that you're doing.

19:58.741 --> 20:00.507
- It's very passive aggressive.
- This isn't a joke.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.715
This isn't a joke.
I'm very angry with you.

20:02.748 --> 20:03.981
- [Dixie] Well...
- I'm very upset because I feel

20:04.014 --> 20:05.517
- left out. I've been
a very good friend to you. - OK.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.285
You're a very good friend,
but my problem is...

20:07.318 --> 20:09.125
- You know what? I know what it is.
- [Dixie] What is that?

20:09.158 --> 20:11.824
You were upset with me for getting drunk
at the water park in front of the kids.

20:11.864 --> 20:15.930
- Yeah. Um, that's not what I was
upset about. At all. - OK. Well, then...

20:15.971 --> 20:17.171
Well, then what's the problem?

20:17.204 --> 20:19.709
My big problem is your husband.

20:19.743 --> 20:22.572
Your husband punched
my husband right in the face.

20:22.613 --> 20:23.810
- Excuse me.
- It's true.

20:23.843 --> 20:25.274
He punched me.
He hit me right in the mouth.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.378
- [Kenny] Tall tale.
- [April] Please don't lie.

20:26.411 --> 20:27.683
- That's a tall tale.
- [April] What?

20:27.716 --> 20:29.013
- These are fabrications.
- Yes, you did!

20:29.054 --> 20:31.285
- You hit me in the mouth.
- [overlapping chatter]

20:31.318 --> 20:33.189
One at a time.
One at a time.

20:33.222 --> 20:35.359
- You punched me in the mouth!
- One at a time.

20:35.392 --> 20:37.464
In this house,
we speak one at a time.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.398
OK, fine.
Shut up, Gene. I'll talk.

20:39.431 --> 20:44.099
God. One at a time.

20:44.132 --> 20:47.663
[sighs]

20:47.696 --> 20:52.302
All right. Some stuff happened
at the Congo Canyon Water Park

20:52.335 --> 20:53.870
that I haven't been
100% honest about.

20:53.903 --> 20:56.574
- Damn right.
- After you guys went to bed,

20:56.607 --> 21:00.342
the fellas and I were down at the
bar and we were having some drinks.

21:00.375 --> 21:03.476
We ran into some fans of mine.

21:03.509 --> 21:06.581
And they invited us up to
their hotel room to party.

21:06.614 --> 21:09.516
We got up there and the party was
definitely a little more intense

21:09.549 --> 21:11.989
than any of us had anticipated.

21:12.022 --> 21:16.624
There were girls there.

21:16.657 --> 21:19.124
And Gene had unprotected oral
sex with one of the girls.

21:19.157 --> 21:20.722
- What?!
- What?

21:20.763 --> 21:21.688
- Gene.
- [Kenny] Yeah.

21:21.761 --> 21:23.360
Gene fucked a girl in her ass.

21:23.393 --> 21:25.098
- That is a lie and you know it.
- No, you did, Gene.

21:25.131 --> 21:27.332
- What?
- He... I came into...

21:27.365 --> 21:28.837
- I came into the room.
- Hold on, man.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.140
As soon as I did, I saw him.
I said, "Gene, you're married."

21:30.173 --> 21:32.337
Bam! Punched him in his face
because it upset me.

21:32.370 --> 21:34.768
- I didn't wanna see that.
- Are you fucking nuts, man?

21:34.801 --> 21:36.807
I didn't have sex with anybody.
Tel, could you back me up,

21:36.872 --> 21:37.945
- please?
- Absolutely.

21:37.978 --> 21:40.113
Sit your fucking ass
down right now. Tel.

21:40.146 --> 21:42.344
- You sat there and
watched it fucking happen. - Tel!

21:42.377 --> 21:45.711
You jerked off. He sat there and
let it happen and got off on it.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.416
The worst thing you said that
happened was the cocaine.

21:47.449 --> 21:50.952
What?! Cocaine?!
Cocaine is drugs.

21:50.985 --> 21:53.194
I didn't do any cocaine though.
There was cocaine there.

21:53.227 --> 21:54.626
- [Kenny] Yeah, right, Gene.
- I don't know why I didn't tell you.

21:54.659 --> 21:55.994
- ...don't fucking tell me about!
- Hey!

21:56.027 --> 21:57.898
- What didn't you tell me about?
- I didn't do anything!

21:57.931 --> 21:59.729
- Would you say something here,
Kenny, please? - Coked out dick!

21:59.762 --> 22:02.296
- Coke dick. What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- I didn't do anything!

22:02.329 --> 22:04.800
- Eat your fucking cheese, you rat. Eat it!
- Fuck you. [spits]

22:04.833 --> 22:08.406
I ha... I hate you.
I hate you.

22:08.439 --> 22:12.340
Dix. I didn't do
any drugs, Dix. Come on!

22:12.373 --> 22:17.108
Dix!

22:17.141 --> 22:19.076
This is the cost of lies, guys.

22:19.109 --> 22:23.918
This is when we aren't faithful to
the ones that we make promises to.

22:23.983 --> 22:27.926
I think it's probably best if we
just end spaghetti night now, OK?

22:27.959 --> 22:30.093
Let's go. Tel, get up.
Get the fuck out of here.

22:30.126 --> 22:33.228
Let's go.

22:33.261 --> 22:39.668
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

22:39.701 --> 22:50.870
[chatter]

22:50.903 --> 22:52.101
[Guy] Hey.

22:52.142 --> 22:55.403
Kenny P.
What's up, champion?

22:55.444 --> 22:58.239
- [Kenny] Spicy. What's happening, baby?
- KP, yeah. How you feeling?

22:58.272 --> 23:00.772
- Wonderful, man. Wonderful.
- All right. Soak it in.

23:00.805 --> 23:03.335
There it is. There's
your ball field today.

23:03.368 --> 23:04.903
You ready to strike
some motherfuckers out?

23:04.936 --> 23:06.641
[Dontel] Yo.

23:06.674 --> 23:11.476
Guy Young and Kenny Flowers.

23:11.541 --> 23:14.043
- What's up, Dontel?
- Ah. Dontel, Dontel.

23:14.076 --> 23:15.747
- How's the job hunt going?
- [laughs]

23:15.780 --> 23:19.248
Don't worry. They still take food
stamps here at the concession stand.

23:19.281 --> 23:22.879
- [laughs] - Hey, on the real tip, I wanted
to apologize to you, Dontel.

23:22.912 --> 23:25.047
I'm so sorry I ruined
your whole entire fucking life.

23:25.088 --> 23:26.319
- [laughter]
- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

23:26.352 --> 23:28.222
- Must be a tough break, kid.
- [Guy] Burn!

23:28.255 --> 23:29.854
Na-na-na-na. Ain't no thang
but a chicken wing.

23:29.887 --> 23:33.020
Truth be told, man,
I feel sorry for you.

23:33.053 --> 23:36.689
Having to work for this
insecure backstabbing asshole.

23:36.722 --> 23:39.425
I ain't telling you nothing
you don't already know, right?

23:39.458 --> 23:41.865
Look at you, man. Come on.
You're just obsessed with me.

23:41.898 --> 23:44.033
- Nah.
- [Guy] You want to butt fuck me at the charity event?

23:44.066 --> 23:46.096
- Is that what you want?
- [Dontel] Nah.

23:46.129 --> 23:49.565
You got it all wrong, bruh. See
I know why you cut me out, Guy.

23:49.598 --> 23:50.564
Yeah, why's that?

23:50.597 --> 23:51.699
Because you saw the beauty

23:51.732 --> 23:53.434
of my black ass coming for you.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.338
But, hey...

23:55.371 --> 23:57.770
Today's about the charities.

23:57.803 --> 24:01.470
About the kids. About AIDS.
And about having a good time.

24:01.503 --> 24:04.003
So we just gonna
put a pin in that for now.

24:04.036 --> 24:07.509
- Peace, bitches.
- Bye, Dontel.

24:07.542 --> 24:10.305
You fucking loser.
All of you.

24:10.338 --> 24:14.909
And that's why we're here. To show
Dontel that he's a fucking loser.

24:14.942 --> 24:18.009
- Because losers always forget.
- [chuckles]

24:18.042 --> 24:19.673
Hell yeah, they do.

24:19.714 --> 24:21.946
Let's smash these
fucking losers so hard,

24:21.979 --> 24:25.344
their charities
don't get a goddamn dime.

24:25.385 --> 24:36.416
[drum beating]

24:36.449 --> 24:38.490
Hey, hey.
Jed, hold up for a second.

24:38.523 --> 24:39.521
Let me help you with that.

24:39.554 --> 24:41.960
Thank you kindly there, Kenny.

24:41.993 --> 24:43.559
- There you go, bud.
- You're a good man.

24:43.592 --> 24:45.358
[Dontel] Guy.

24:45.391 --> 24:47.926
You look real comfortable stroking
that black thing like that.

24:47.959 --> 24:51.966
[laughs] Look like
Dontel in your hand.

24:51.999 --> 24:54.533
[laughter]

24:54.566 --> 24:57.470
On you mark.

24:57.503 --> 25:01.107
