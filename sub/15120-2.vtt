- No. I'm looking after Mr Turner's son

How nice.

- Are you a doctor?
- Not a medical doctor, no.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.570
An engineer, consulting on a project.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.841
What kind of project?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.968
It's very technical, I'm afraid.

- GOEBEL: Mr Turner,

01:48.520 --> 01:51.046

- GOEBEL: Indeed.

shadowing this bloke from the City.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.765

- Betrayed?</i>

06:59.240 --> 07:00.446
More likely.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.164
Shall I instruct Sam to retrieve him?

07:05.360 --> 07:06.850
That's not an option.

Yes, but we can't retrieve him.

Not at all. I expect we won't meet again

Well, you might say to yourself,
"I'm not going to answer."

11:24.680 --> 11:26.444
Either way you're dead.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.523
So what you got to decide

11:29.600 --> 11:33.286
is how much pain can you bear before you go.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.329
You have a little think about that.

- Where's he heading?
- ZOE: He's booked on an early ﬂight home'

12:42.400 --> 12:44.084
I'll ask Amsterdam to keep an eye on him.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.647
- Where are they keeping Hasan?
- Lower basement.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.611
- Access?
- No stairs. Magnetic key in the lift

13:35.480 --> 13:38.086
You and Hasan weren't exactly best friends.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.641
So now you think I set him up, too, do you'?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.324
Like I set you up in Tangier.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.448
Hasan may be a prick, but he's not sloppy.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.841
- I didn't set him up.
- Then who did?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.649
At least now you're asking the right question.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.569
- Fowkes.
- Milk! W hero!

14:17.120 --> 14:18.610
- Sam?
- She's on it.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.610
So what's she going to do then?

14:21.680 --> 14:23.364
Shut up and eat your Weetabix, Fowkes.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.522
Well, then. One of our males is down.
How do we get him out?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.967
- We don't.
- What do you mean, "We don't"?

14:28.320 --> 14:30.561
That old bastard thinks Hasan
tried to kidnap his grandson.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.081
- He'll torture him to death.
- Not if he's already dead.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.530
She's going to kill Hasan?

14:46.480 --> 14:49.723
- What for?
- You said it yourself. They'll torture him'

14:49.800 --> 14:52.406
He'll talk, exposing Sam and the rest of us.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.006
That puts us all at risk, not just the operation.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.249
Sod this. I didn't sign up
for killing our own man,

14:58.320 --> 15:01.085
Yeah, you did, actually. You signed up for
whatever Byzantium orders you to do.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.208
And you're bloody well paid for it,
now sit down.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.089
A man is down, we rescue him, full stop.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.801
There are circumstances under which
any of us could be terminated.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.720
- Hasan understands that.
- Well, I don't!

15:11.800 --> 15:15.361
All Tumer knows right now is that
Hasan tried to kidnap his grandson'

15:15.480 --> 15:18.245
If Hasan reveals he works for Byzantium,
it compromises our client...

15:18.320 --> 15:21.483
- We don't even know who our bloody client is!
- And puts us all in danger.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.005
And the op is blown.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.244
If Hasan talks. Not if we rescue him first.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.203
A rescue proves that he is a professional.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.690
If he dies in custody,
the damage is contained'

15:32.920 --> 15:34.570

27:11.880 --> 27:14.884
- You ready, Alex?
- Give me a second, I'll be right back'

27:20.080 --> 27:22.242
- Could I have a word?
- Of course.

Look, I really appreciate
what you've tried to do for me

27:27.080 --> 27:30.084
and Eddie's a wonderful boy, but I can't stay.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.766
Why not?

27:36.920 --> 27:39.400
It's pretty clear your father
doesn't want me here.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.128
He's a very difficult man,
he tries to bully everyone'

27:45.400 --> 27:49.405
You're the first person Eddie's made
any connection with since his mother died'

27:49.520 --> 27:52.330
I can see he desperately
wants you to stay' So do I'

27:55.440 --> 27:57.044

29:22.000 --> 29:25.402

29:25.480 --> 29:28.450

One of Turners men must have

31:52.600 --> 31:55.251
No. I don't perceive that. Not at all.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.925
You're strong, are you?

49:39.600 --> 49:40.761
Well, let's see then.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.050
Come on, let's just see how strong you are.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.001
(ELEVATOR THUDS)

50:18.160 --> 50:20.845
This is the bag of shit
who tried to take little Eddie.

50:20.920 --> 50:23.127
You want to show me how strong you are?

50:27.960 --> 50:30.247
Here, take it.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.446
Take it!

50:36.560 --> 50:40.121
Well, now's your chance, son.
Crush his skull in, if you want to

50:40.280 --> 50:41.964
You're within your rights.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.971
Well, come on, then!

50:48.800 --> 50:49.961
Do it.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.441
Do it.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.691
I didn't think so

51:00.960 --> 51:02.485
I didn't bloody think so.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.801
(METAL CLANKING)

51:15.320 --> 51:16.606
Why did you do it?

51:18.640 --> 51:19.766
Wm'?

51:57.040 --> 52:00.044
- Where the hell have you been?
- It's good to see you, too

52:00.200 --> 52:02.362
- What's the plan?
- You tell me who tried to kill me.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.124
Uh-uh. After you set me free.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.361
No deal.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.211
I ran into your friend,
he didn't introduce himself.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.408
So you tell me his name or you die.

52:10.520 --> 52:11.931
I don't know his name.
He didn't give it to me,

52:12.000 --> 52:13.604
What did he say to you?

52:14.960 --> 52:16.610
If you came back to Byzantium,

52:16.680 --> 52:19.047
I'd get a hundred thousand quid
if I gave him your head'

52:23.840 --> 52:25.569
And you didn't think to tell me?

52:27.240 --> 52:28.366
Or Keel?

52:28.880 --> 52:30.245
I'm telling you now.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.410
I'd watch yourself, though.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.403
He may have gone to someone else
on the team.

52:38.640 --> 52:42.201
We got the results back on his prints,
there's no match anywhere'

52:42.280 --> 52:43.964
This bloke's a ghost.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.605
- What else?
- There is nothing else'

52:48.680 --> 52:51.286
He must've given you a number.
A way to contact him'

52:51.360 --> 52:53.169
He said he'd find me. That's all.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.971
I'm telling you the truth!
Now cut me loose, for God's sake!

53:09.120 --> 53:12.761
I've got a score of my own to settle.
With whoever set me up.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.886
- Your fingerprints.
- Yeah. Thanks.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.206
(PHONE BEEPS)

54:31.000 --> 54:32.889
She's done it, hasn't she?

54:39.280 --> 54:40.486
Happy now, are you?

54:42.080 --> 54:45.209
You think that, you're a bigger idiot
than I thought you were.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.561
- You're late.
- Eddie had trouble sleeping'

55:02.720 --> 55:04.051
What does Turner think happened?

55:04.400 --> 55:05.640
Hasan got loose.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.690
The guard killed him before
succumbing to his own injuries

55:08.760 --> 55:09.921
That'll work

55:11.040 --> 55:13.725
This have something to do with
those steps you fell down'?

55:15.560 --> 55:17.881
Didn't you serve together in Afghanistan?

55:18.560 --> 55:21.928
They killed her to get to you, didn't they'?
To ﬂush you out.

55:24.280 --> 55:27.568
The longer you stay,
the worse it's going to get'

55:30.360 --> 55:31.850
Go, Sam,

55:33.600 --> 55:35.170
before it's too late.

55:36.305 --> 55:42.201
