My friends and I love those.

to another establishment

Yeah.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.792
since this is
a pyramid scheme,

I texted you
all that awful stuff

07:22.125 --> 07:23.583
that her friend
said about her.

07:23.667 --> 07:24.834
I figured by now
you-you'd give him

07:24.917 --> 07:26.375
one of your
nagging mom talks.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.750
No, because I'm
not a nagging mom.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.166
I'm a cool mom.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.667
I just found out
when Burning Man is.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.250
I can't make it.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.750
And I don't care what
anyone's friend says--

07:33.834 --> 07:35.583
I'm not getting between
Gerald and a girl.

07:35.667 --> 07:39.625
Apparently you don't realize
the severity of this situation.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.417
All right, I'm gonna
tell you something.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.917
But you have to promise

07:43.000 --> 07:44.792
that you'll never tell
another living soul. Swear?

07:44.875 --> 07:47.041
Yes, fine, whatever.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.792
Summer of 2008,
I briefly dated Tila Tequila.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.917
I'll spare you the details,
but it did not end well.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.291
What does this have
to do with anything?

07:53.375 --> 07:54.792
The moral of this story is:

07:54.875 --> 07:56.583
do not fall in love
with a party girl.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.709
And I guarantee you, Gerald's
doing that right as I speak.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.500
Okay, look, I know
that you're new to this,

08:00.583 --> 08:02.291
so I'm gonna
boil this down for you.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.875
Do not meddle
in your son's love life.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.125
It will backfire.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.917
He will end up liking her more.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.500
You've just got to be
cool, man, like me.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.792
Cool like you, huh?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.959
Edie, I hate to
put you on the spot.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.792
Who's cooler,
Grandma or Jimmy?

08:14.875 --> 08:16.125
Who's cooler, me or her?

08:16.208 --> 08:17.125
Me?

08:17.208 --> 08:18.125
Yeah.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.125
Thank you.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.125
The kid said yeah.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.625
I rest my case.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.417
(whispers):
I know you were lying.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.834
(Armenian folk music plays)

08:26.917 --> 08:28.166
What is this?

08:28.250 --> 08:30.417
Oh, uh, it's an
Armenian folk song.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.208
Frankie's a
quarter Armenian.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.750
You seem to know
a lot about this girl

08:34.834 --> 08:36.375
after dating her only a week.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.834
(beeps)

08:37.917 --> 08:39.583
Oh, my printer's done
printing the printer.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.834
Ooh.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.834
It looks just like a 3D printer.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.375
(sighs)

08:44.458 --> 08:46.625
This is how
I'll remember you, Printy.

08:46.709 --> 08:47.625
What are you doing?

08:47.709 --> 08:48.917
Oh.
(chuckles.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.834
Selling the old girl.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.291
Yeah, need a little extra cash
for a little lover's weekend

08:53.375 --> 08:55.000
with Frankie in Vegas.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.834
(grunts)
Oh, question.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.834
Do you get a discount
if you clean your own room?

08:58.917 --> 09:01.625
(phone chimes)

09:01.709 --> 09:04.083
Uh, like, in
sleeping bags.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.917
What about if you
don't turn on the TV?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.542
What about if you don't
use the soap?

09:16.834 --> 09:18.125
(door opens)

09:23.417 --> 09:24.875
Jimmy?

09:24.959 --> 09:25.875
Hi.

09:25.959 --> 09:27.875
Oh, my God.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.709
You did not bring me sushi.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.583
You love me, stalker.

09:31.667 --> 09:32.583
Guilty.

09:32.667 --> 09:33.875
Is Frankie around?

09:33.959 --> 09:34.875
Why?

09:34.959 --> 09:36.875
Threesome much? Ha.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.875
I'm gonna go get
some teriyaki sauce.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.750
Okay.

09:45.834 --> 09:49.542
"Aunt eater"-- A-U-N-T.
(chuckles)

09:49.625 --> 09:51.542
Does anyone else know
about this<i> Far Side? </i>

09:51.625 --> 09:52.750
Funny.

09:52.834 --> 09:53.917
Hey, lover.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.208
Hi. Ow.
(giggles)

09:55.291 --> 09:57.166
Loud.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.166
Um, well, you know,
it was good seeing you.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.542
Can you point me
to Frankie's, um, work pen?

10:01.625 --> 10:03.000
Uh, I want to talk to her.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.000
Well, she's with Roger, our
CEO, at a business lunch

10:05.083 --> 10:07.542
they were supposed to be
back from an hour ago,

10:07.625 --> 10:09.375
aka, they're
totally boning.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.917
She's cheating
on Gerald with her boss?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.375
Did I hear
"cheating"?

10:13.458 --> 10:14.917
Are we talking
about the Patriots

10:15.000 --> 10:16.083
or are we talking about
Roger and Frankie?

10:16.166 --> 10:17.083
(laughter)

10:17.166 --> 10:18.917
Guys, come on.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.291
Roger's a married man.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.333
I'm sure they're
just having lunch...

10:22.417 --> 10:24.333
delivered by
room service.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.041
(laughter)

10:30.917 --> 10:32.667
That's my boyfriend.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.542
He's my new boyfriend.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.750
And this is the dream factory.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.000
This is where I shoot
my makeup tutorials,

10:41.083 --> 10:44.667
I run my businesses, and I come
up with ideas for new ones.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.750
ANNELISE:
"Miniature elephants"?

10:47.834 --> 10:49.041
Super-small.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.250
Why don't we
just get started.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.000
What are your
long-term goals?

10:54.083 --> 10:56.709
Ooh, good question...
for me to ask you.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.875
What are your long-term goals?

10:58.959 --> 10:59.875
My goals don't matter.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.458
Wrong, they do matter.

11:01.542 --> 11:02.959
You matter.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.500
Please just
say your goals.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.291
I wanted to look at patio
furniture before work.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.333
(chuckles) I think we zeroed
in on what the problem is.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.000
Bad attitude.
(chuckles)

11:10.083 --> 11:12.458
Wait, what do you think
is happening here?

11:12.542 --> 11:15.000
Oh, God, you think
you're mentoring me?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.959
Yes. No?

11:17.041 --> 11:19.542
Why on earth would
I need your advice?
Excuse me?

11:19.625 --> 11:23.000
No offense, but you're the most
scattered person I've ever met.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.333
If you're going
to be successful,

11:24.417 --> 11:26.000
you've got to
pick one thing.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.000
Well, I'm sorry
for having dreams,

11:28.083 --> 11:30.750
for wanting to be more than
just "Jimmy's assistant."

11:30.834 --> 11:32.542
Everybody has dreams.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.166
I was gonna be
a soul singer.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.583
But, like most people,
I grew up and found a real job.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.250
So first and
last lesson:

11:38.333 --> 11:39.542
grow the hell up.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.959
Hey, you're in my house.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.291
No, I'm in your parents' house.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.291
Business journal entry 63.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.291
Had to kick a girl's ass today.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.041
Guess again.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.000
Do you want to
call your mommy?
Sister,
these guns are gonna...

11:53.083 --> 11:54.083
Peekaboo!

11:54.166 --> 11:56.625
Oh, hi, monkey-pie.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.041
Oh, how was your nap?

11:58.125 --> 12:00.041
Come here.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.125
Oh, look at you.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.041
And then Elaine in accounting
said that she heard

12:06.125 --> 12:07.500
noises coming
from Roger's office,

12:07.583 --> 12:09.041
and then... and then
Jerry from I.T.,

12:09.125 --> 12:10.500
he said he definitely
heard noises,

12:10.583 --> 12:11.917
and they were sex noises.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.041
Wait, I-I thought
Jerry was from HR.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.041
No, Gary is from HR.
Gary from HR.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.792
Pay attention,
Victor.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.000
So I<i> should </i>do something
about this, right?

12:20.083 --> 12:21.166
No.
Uh-uh, no.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.625
Absolutely do nothing.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.208
Got it. So you guys
are on the fence.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.208
No, we're
really not.
Actually, it's...

12:26.291 --> 12:29.208
(knife scraping)

12:29.291 --> 12:31.250
What if I told you
there was a way

12:31.333 --> 12:33.250
to expose Frankie
for the cheater she is

12:33.333 --> 12:35.041
without having to lift a finger?

12:35.125 --> 12:36.834
If this is your stupid
"Ryan's Roses" knockoff,

12:36.917 --> 12:38.083
I'm not interested.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.458
Um, "knockoff"?

12:39.542 --> 12:40.959
No, this is
completely different.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.083
"Ravi's Rezzies"

12:42.166 --> 12:44.083
offers the
suspected cheater

12:44.166 --> 12:46.291
a romantic dinner
for two at Jimmy's.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.083
If he shows up with his wife,
then we're down a dinner,

12:49.166 --> 12:52.000
but if he shows up
with his mistress,

12:52.083 --> 12:54.583
then he, sir,
has been "Rezzied."

12:54.667 --> 12:56.125
No... All right,
I'm not interested.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.625
And how is this any different
than "Ryan's Roses"?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.375
Seacrest does it on the radio.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.083
No, uh, you know what,
I'm just gonna call Gerald.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.166
I'm gonna tell him
this girl's cheating on him.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.959
Or you can tell
him in person.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.625
He just sat down.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.542
Dad, you remember Frankie.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.041
Of course!
Try the calamari.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.542
Can I speak with you
real fast, please?

13:19.625 --> 13:21.291
What's going on here?

13:21.375 --> 13:22.500
Gerald thought
it would be nice

13:22.583 --> 13:23.500
if we had dinner
with his girlfriend.

13:23.583 --> 13:24.667
She's his
girlfriend now?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.667
Frankie is cheating
on Gerald with her boss.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.458
They hooked up at lunch today.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.166
If you would have heard Mark
from accounting do the noises,

13:30.250 --> 13:31.542
(scoffs) you'd be just
as pissed as I am.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.542
What the hell are
you talking about?

13:33.625 --> 13:34.959
Did you go to her office?

13:35.041 --> 13:36.834
No. Y-Yes.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.834
Wow, I thought you were
the cool detached guy.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.542
When did you become
a Jewish mother?

13:42.625 --> 13:44.041
Okay, we are gonna go
back to that table,

13:44.125 --> 13:45.542
and you are not gonna
do anything stupid

13:45.625 --> 13:47.333
while we get to know
our son's girlfriend,

13:47.417 --> 13:49.291
who he really likes,
which is all that matters.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.083
Oh, apparently you don't
care about cheating.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.542
What, are you a Patriots fan?
(chuckles)

13:52.625 --> 13:54.417
It's a sports... thing.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.583
Hi. May I join you?

13:56.667 --> 13:58.583
Yeah. I'm so glad
you can eat with us.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.083
I can't promise
how much I'll eat,

14:00.166 --> 14:02.208
'cause I had a "late
working lunch" today.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.291
Anyone else here

14:03.375 --> 14:04.500
have a "working lunch"

14:04.583 --> 14:05.542
that went "late"?

14:05.625 --> 14:07.583
Going pretty hard
on those air quotes.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.166
So, Frankie, we've heard so many
great things about you.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.750
Oh, my gosh, that's
such a relief

14:11.834 --> 14:13.583
considering the first
impression I made at the club.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.583
Jimmy, I asked Gerald
to set up this dinner

14:15.667 --> 14:17.291
because I wanted you to know
that was not me.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.959
I'm not a club person,
but some coworkers wanted

14:20.041 --> 14:21.959
to take me out to
celebrate a promotion,

14:22.041 --> 14:24.500
and what was supposed to
be one glass of prosecco

14:24.583 --> 14:27.333
turned into me force-feeding
your son vodka

14:27.417 --> 14:29.542
off of my stomach.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.291
But the real reason that
I wanted to meet you:

14:32.375 --> 14:34.208
free dinner.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.041
She's funny. I feel like
I'm in<i> The Far Side. </i>

14:38.125 --> 14:39.834
I love free meals.
Who bought you lunch?

14:39.917 --> 14:41.458
Oh, gosh, don't get me
started on that.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.709
I have this really
creepy boss

14:42.792 --> 14:44.625
who drags me to so-called
business lunches

14:44.709 --> 14:46.625
and hits on me the entire
time-- it's the worst.

14:46.709 --> 14:49.542
Well, that is a horrible
and very believable reason

14:49.625 --> 14:52.000
for you to have a late lunch
with your boss.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.792
Gerald...

14:54.875 --> 14:56.500
Are you sure?
Uh...

14:56.583 --> 14:57.792
I thought we were
cutting back on the carbs.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.083
GERALD:
Yes. Sorry.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.291
Well, don't put it back
after you touched it!

15:01.375 --> 15:03.500
Oop. Now there's
olive oil on your shirt.

15:03.583 --> 15:04.625
Great. Okay.
Up. Come on.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.625
GERALD:
Sorry. Yeah.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.625
Oh, I can't take
him anywhere.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.625
SARA:
That's my son.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.959
That bitch has got to go.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.542
You forgot this.

15:19.625 --> 15:20.667
Thanks.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.333
So you think
I'm a mess, huh?

15:22.417 --> 15:24.542
(scoffs) Yeah.
You're a mess,

15:24.625 --> 15:26.667
your ideas suck, and
you sell an energy drink

15:26.750 --> 15:28.542
that exploded
a cow heart in testing.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.250
Hey, the cow had
a pre-existing condition.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.667
But you've got
something more valuable

15:32.750 --> 15:34.583
than good ideas:
you're fearless.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.375
Maybe someday you can
teach me a thing or two.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.667
What are you doing?

15:41.750 --> 15:43.625
Teaching you
a thing or two.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

15:48.333 --> 15:50.667
for the soulful stylings
of Annelise Wilkinson.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.542
(quietly): Holy crap.

15:52.625 --> 15:53.667
This is your passion.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.291
Get up here.
Be fearless.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.792
Hi.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.625
"Tempted" by Squeeze.

16:04.709 --> 16:05.792
Take it up a half step.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.709
Keep it in the pocket.
Count it off.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.834
(song begins)

16:12.667 --> 16:14.709
(singing badly):
♪ I bought a toothbrush ♪

16:14.792 --> 16:16.417
♪ Some toothpaste ♪

16:16.500 --> 16:18.709
♪ A flannel for my face ♪

16:18.792 --> 16:21.500

16:25.875 --> 16:30.500
♪ Let's get out
of this place... ♪

16:30.583 --> 16:32.709
Did she ask me
if she could do that?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.166
Maybe in an e-mail.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.000
We cannot have
our son's girlfriend

16:36.083 --> 16:37.709
bossing him around
like that.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.792
Who does she think she is,
the bread police?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.208
Ooh, look at you.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.625
I thought you were
LL Chill Mom.

16:42.709 --> 16:43.750
LL Cool Mom.
LL Cool Mom.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.000
(phone chimes)

16:45.083 --> 16:47.166
(Sara gasps quietly)

16:47.250 --> 16:49.750
Frankie just got a text

16:49.834 --> 16:51.959
from somebody
called "Big Daddy."

16:52.041 --> 16:53.750
Ooh, I'll bet
that's her boss.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.083
We shouldn't look
at it though, right?

16:55.166 --> 16:56.875
No, definitely not.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.250
(gasps)

17:00.375 --> 17:01.583
(gasps)

17:02.834 --> 17:04.500
(singing badly):
♪ A foot without a sock ♪

17:04.583 --> 17:06.500
♪ Your body gets much closer ♪

17:06.583 --> 17:08.291
♪ I fumble for the clock... ♪

17:08.375 --> 17:10.500
And then
Big Daddy wrote,

17:10.583 --> 17:12.834
"You know who wants you
so bad? Little Daddy."

17:12.917 --> 17:15.125
Ugh! He's got a name for it?

17:15.208 --> 17:16.500
That old perv.

17:16.583 --> 17:17.542
Scroll up, scroll up.

17:17.625 --> 17:18.875
Oh, oh, oh, look.

17:18.959 --> 17:21.542
Two hours ago, she wrote,
"I can't wait

17:21.625 --> 17:23.208
"for you to zap this bass.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.375
"Oops, autocorrect, haha.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.667
But seriously,
I want you to tap this..."

17:26.750 --> 17:28.750
Okay, that is enough.

17:28.834 --> 17:29.542
looking at Frankie's phone?

17:29.625 --> 17:31.041
Uh...

17:31.125 --> 17:33.542
Gerald, you should
know something.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.542
Hey, boo! Thought I'd bring
by some homemade brownies,

17:35.625 --> 17:36.834
since someone brought me

17:36.917 --> 17:38.208
sushi at work today.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.959
Holy crap.
You were at her work today?

17:40.041 --> 17:42.208
Yes, because...

17:42.291 --> 17:43.542
Priya, I'm in love with you.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.208
Oh, my God,
it's happening...

17:45.291 --> 17:46.542
And it's "Pree-ya."

17:46.625 --> 17:48.083
JIMMY: "Pree-ya."
And while I was there,

17:48.166 --> 17:50.792
I found out she's having
an affair with her boss.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.542
ROGER: I can't believe
I won Ravi's Rezzies.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.542
I never win anything!

17:54.625 --> 18:01.625
♪ Tempted by the fruit
of another! ♪

18:01.959 --> 18:03.291
Yeah!

18:04.667 --> 18:06.834
Maybe a table
away from the stage.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.500
Roger?
Frankie?

18:08.583 --> 18:09.583
Priya?

18:09.667 --> 18:10.500
That's Roger?

18:10.583 --> 18:11.417
What? Who?

18:11.500 --> 18:13.667
Hey! Ravi from Ravi's Rezzies.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.500
You must be Roger.
Roger, tell us,

18:15.583 --> 18:16.792
who did you choose

18:16.875 --> 18:18.417
to share you
Rezzie with?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.417
My wife, Evelyn.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.583
Well, g-good news, everyone.
This guy checks out.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.542
All right, back to the kitchen.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.417
Dad, what the hell
is going on?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.667
Well, I went to their office
because I knew she was bad news

18:29.750 --> 18:31.291
and, you know, I wanted
to have a chill conversation.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.792
And to bring me sushi.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.583
JIMMY: You know, it might
not be with Roger,

18:34.667 --> 18:36.208
but she's definitely
having an affair with someone.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.125
Who's "Big Daddy"?

18:37.208 --> 18:39.000
I am. I'm Big Daddy.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.000
Barf.
I've been
developing an app

18:41.083 --> 18:42.792
that lets you send out texts
you write ahead of time

18:42.875 --> 18:43.917
and deliver them
whenever you want.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.333
I thought it'd be
a fun, sexy way

18:45.417 --> 18:46.625
to surprise Frankie
during dinner.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.208
It wasn't.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.542
If you and Roger
aren't a thing,

18:49.625 --> 18:50.625
then why does
everyone at your work

18:50.709 --> 18:51.834
think you're
sleeping together?

18:51.917 --> 18:53.166
Mmm, risotto.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.792
Oh, my God,
are you still

18:54.875 --> 18:56.792
spreading rumors about
me, you psychopath?

18:56.875 --> 18:59.750
I drove you around
for a year!

18:59.834 --> 19:01.750
"Pree-ya..."
Priya, I don't love you anymore.

19:01.834 --> 19:02.917
PRIYA:
I understand.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.375
And quite frankly,

19:04.458 --> 19:07.125
I have some things
to work through.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.375
Well, maybe we should all,
uh, take turns

19:11.458 --> 19:13.041
apologizing
to one another.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.375
Mm-hmm. You first.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.625
No, thanks.

19:15.709 --> 19:16.792
Let's go.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.625
(sighs)

19:18.709 --> 19:20.458
(chortles)

19:20.542 --> 19:21.625
(laughs)

19:21.709 --> 19:23.041
Whoo!

19:23.125 --> 19:25.625
I feel amazing.

19:25.709 --> 19:26.917
I need a drink.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.250
Any chance you
want to make out?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.583
No, never mind.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.667
Unless you're into it.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.667
You know you sang
like ass, right?

19:32.750 --> 19:34.792
Yeah. That's why
I feel amazing.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.083
I know I made the right decision
giving up on my dream.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.750
I guess I was
your mentor after all.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.250
Huh.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.583
Yeah, I guess so.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.667
Sweet!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.667
That'll be 185 bucks.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.000
Make the check out to "cash."

19:47.083 --> 19:49.792
(laughs)

19:49.875 --> 19:51.166
Oh, you serious?

19:53.917 --> 19:56.500
Ger, I know you're not
talking to us,

19:56.583 --> 19:58.041
but we wanted to drop by
and give you

19:58.125 --> 19:59.667
this brand-new
3-D printer we got you.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.208
You guys seriously
bought me a...

20:01.291 --> 20:02.500
regular black-and-white
inkjet printer?

20:02.583 --> 20:04.667
Yep. The guy at the store

20:04.750 --> 20:06.583
said he had the same one
at home. Enjoy.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.792
I tried to explain it
to him.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.500
"Works with Windows."

20:10.583 --> 20:11.834
Gerald, I don't know
what to say.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.125
We messed up.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.709
Not that
it changes anything,

20:14.792 --> 20:16.417
but I only messed up
right at the end.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.875
JIMMY:
Honestly, I don't know

20:17.959 --> 20:18.875
what's happening to me.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.792
I mean, sure, we all think of me

20:20.875 --> 20:22.792
as this sexy guardian angel,

20:22.875 --> 20:24.792
but I guess at the end
of the day, I...

20:24.875 --> 20:27.333
I'm just a dad.

20:27.417 --> 20:29.083
Just a normal,
sexy dad.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.667
(whispers):
Almost there.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.291
Guys, I appreciate
all the concern,

20:33.375 --> 20:35.166
and it makes me feel nice
to have a dad

20:35.250 --> 20:37.542
that worries about me,
but I'm an adult.

20:37.625 --> 20:38.709
All right? If I want
to get into

20:38.792 --> 20:40.125
a serious relationship
with a girl

20:40.208 --> 20:41.959
I did body shots with
at a nightclub,

20:42.041 --> 20:43.917
I'm gonna do it. Okay?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.709
Mom, I can tell you're not
a big fan of Frankie's.
What?

20:46.792 --> 20:49.709
But she's great for me.
You know my texting app?

20:49.792 --> 20:52.250
Uh-huh.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.834
And then all of a sudden,
I'm dating Frankie...

20:53.917 --> 20:55.834
boom, I got a beta version
in, like, a week.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.917
I don't know why
I'm explaining this.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.458
It doesn't really matter
if you like her,

20:59.542 --> 21:00.750
because I do.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.959
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

21:03.041 --> 21:04.750
I am going to
an insanely expensive hotel

21:04.834 --> 21:06.542
in Vegas with my lady.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.583
These pre-made sandwiches
should help offset the cost of

21:09.667 --> 21:12.583
the Backstage Penn &amp; Teller
Experience. VIP seats.

21:12.667 --> 21:13.750
Front row.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.125
You can't afford that.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.458
Here, let me give you
some money.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.834
Nope. Like, here I am,
meddling again.

21:17.917 --> 21:18.834
No more meddling.

21:18.917 --> 21:19.750
Meddling's okay.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.750
Hey.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.583
She'll probably want
to get her nails done.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.250
And massages.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.834
There's the whole dolphin
experience, you want to...
