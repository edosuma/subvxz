everybody here at Christmas.

00:18.684 --> 00:19.919
- Yeah.

00:19.952 --> 00:23.155
- Whose idea was it for us

00:19.952 --> 00:23.155
to draw ornaments?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.457
- Me.

00:24.490 --> 00:25.524
- But how in the world

00:24.490 --> 00:25.524
am I ever going

00:25.557 --> 00:26.760
to recreate this?

00:26.792 --> 00:28.561
- Why would you put

00:26.792 --> 00:28.561
that on an ornament?

00:28.594 --> 00:29.596
- Look at that!

00:29.629 --> 00:30.929
That is freaking perfection.

00:30.963 --> 00:32.231

I'm going to tell the judges

00:44.978 --> 00:46.279

01:02.295 --> 01:04.640

The eggnog that you make

01:05.331 --> 01:07.966
you can run cars off of.

this ratty tree.

a little dust on it.

- Todd, I want to host

04:21.728 --> 04:24.596
Christmas this year.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.699
I can't think

04:24.630 --> 04:26.699
of anything better

04:26.733 --> 04:28.134
than to have my grandbabies

spend the night with me

04:28.168 --> 04:30.269

the work that goes

04:36.942 --> 04:39.790
into doing all of this.

04:39.790 --> 04:41.581
Well, now, Todd,

04:39.790 --> 04:41.581
this might be my last one.

So if you feel like--

04:50.189 --> 04:51.990
we're afraid of.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.939
Did I really just get suckered

04:52.920 --> 04:54.939
into letting my mom

04:54.939 --> 04:55.949
host Christmas?

04:55.949 --> 04:56.329
- But look on the bright side,

04:56.362 --> 04:58.980
you get to give your voice

04:56.362 --> 04:58.980
a rest,

04:58.980 --> 05:00.600
and my ears, for that matter.

My mom and dad did the best

We didn't have a whole month,

I don't think Santa's gonna

you wherever you are.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.734
is the best gift of all.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.569
- So that means that I can take

18:21.768 --> 18:23.569
the expensive gift

18:23.603 --> 18:25.171
I got for you back?

<i>[instrumental "Jingle Bells"]</i>

18:34.146 --> 18:36.415
- You know what they say,

18:34.146 --> 18:36.415
how many Chrisleys does it take

18:36.449 --> 18:38.218
to screw a lightbulb in?

18:38.250 --> 18:39.752
- Grayson, you need to be

18:38.250 --> 18:39.752
careful right there.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.421
Make sure he does not fall.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.421
- Yeah.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.455
- Because I don't think

18:41.453 --> 18:43.455
he has fully signed his will

18:43.490 --> 18:44.457
over to me yet.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.825
- And that's the reason

18:45.858 --> 18:47.930
Grayson is holding the ladder

18:45.858 --> 18:47.930
because you've made

18:47.126 --> 18:49.295

18:49.328 --> 18:50.697
Okay, so y'all think

18:49.328 --> 18:50.697
it looks good?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.897
- Yeah, I think it looks great.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.666
- She's gonna be so excited.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.666
- I know!

18:53.700 --> 18:55.701
All right,

18:53.700 --> 18:55.701
I'm gonna go get her.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.671

18:55.734 --> 18:57.671
with making amends,

18:57.703 --> 18:59.204
I mean, it's Chloe's turn.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.440

I have all the faith

19:00.472 --> 19:02.307
in the world in you.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.676

19:05.144 --> 19:06.378

19:21.661 --> 19:23.229
that Santa's gonna miss that.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.298

19:23.262 --> 19:25.298
I did all this for you?

19:25.330 --> 19:26.532
- No.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.835
- Because I love you

19:26.566 --> 19:28.835
to the moon and back.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.369
And I have always made sure

19:28.867 --> 19:31.369
that my kids

19:31.369 --> 19:33.772
had a great Christmas just like

my mama always made sure

19:33.807 --> 19:35.208
I had a great Christmas.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.179
my Santa tracker on,

19:39.211 --> 19:40.713
and it looks like

19:39.211 --> 19:40.713
he's over Italy,

19:40.747 --> 19:42.214
so we gotta go in.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.482
- Come on--

19:42.248 --> 19:43.482
- Italy?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.509
I mean, we still got

19:43.516 --> 19:45.509
a little time.

19:45.849 --> 19:46.952
- No!

19:45.849 --> 19:46.952
- No, it's bedtime.

'Cause you have

19:50.123 --> 19:52.592
to bring me something?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.599
- Uh...

19:54.940 --> 19:55.662

Todd, you know how old

It's about 60 or 65 years old.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.465

21:06.499 --> 21:09.301
that Christmas is not about

21:06.499 --> 21:09.301
the décor that you use.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.710
I never thought I'd say that.

the magic about leather

is that you can wear

those black leather pants

21:54.213 --> 21:56.281

21:54.213 --> 21:56.281
any top that you want.
