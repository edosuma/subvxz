00:13.638 --> 00:15.974
And the rest of us starved

<i>and scavenged and prayed,</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:18.893
<i>until they finally found us.</i>

<i>There's a lake.
- Look.</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:49.340
<i>You're not the bad one.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:50.925
<i>Is someone else the bad one?</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:53.219
Someone strung him up

00:53.219 --> 00:54.762

- The blackmail?</i>

01:31.924 --> 01:33.801
<i>Oh, my God, Jeff.
What did you do?!</i>

01:33.801 --> 01:35.970
<i>I was gonna lose the store, Shauna.</i>

01:35.970 --> 01:37.263
<i>So you blackmailed us?</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:39.057
<i>We can get past this.
We can forget it happened.</i>

01:39.057 --> 01:40.183
No, Jeff, we can't.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.101

01:44.354 --> 01:45.938
<i>Uh, yeah,

01:45.938 --> 01:47.440
<i>I think Misty poisoned me again.</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:49.275
<i>I think she poisoned

02:18.554 --> 02:20.973
<i>I'm surprised you're aware

02:20.973 --> 02:22.725

12:53.230 --> 12:54.481
<i>And your journals, too?</i>

12:54.481 --> 12:56.984
<i>Yes.
- Answered too fast that time.</i>

12:56.984 --> 12:58.986
<i>Misty.</i>

12:58.986 --> 13:00.070
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

13:00.070 --> 13:01.321
<i>But, before you go,</i>

13:01.321 --> 13:02.948
<i>you should take
some Hawaii 5-0 punch.</i>

13:02.948 --> 13:04.158
<i>It's just
regular Hawaiian punch,</i>

13:04.158 --> 13:05.451
<i>but I gave it
a snazzier name.</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:07.619
<i>And I can give you
a Tupperware container,</i>

13:07.619 --> 13:08.912
<i>and I can lend you a ladle,</i>

13:08.912 --> 13:11.415
<i>and then you can have,
like, a punch kit.</i>

13:13.250 --> 13:16.045
<i>Just let me know if you'd like
to take anyone to the playroom</i>

13:16.045 --> 13:18.088
<i>to get better acquainted,
Ms. Turner.</i>

13:18.088 --> 13:21.008
<i>Or should I say
Madam Senator?</i>

13:21.008 --> 13:23.594
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:24.803
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

13:24.803 --> 13:28.766
<i>I-I'll just take that one. Steve.</i>

13:28.766 --> 13:29.892
<i>Is it okay
if I meet you out front?</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:31.185
<i>I have to make some calls.</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:33.937
<i>Well, there's some paperwork
to fill out, but...</i>

13:33.937 --> 13:35.272
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

13:35.272 --> 13:37.149
<i>I phone banked for you.</i>

13:37.149 --> 13:39.068
<i>Thank you.
Every vote counted.</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:41.111
<i>Oh, no, I just...</i>

13:41.111 --> 13:42.529
<i>It meant a lot to me,
that's all.</i>

13:42.529 --> 13:45.115
<i>After these last few years,
to be able to support</i>

13:45.115 --> 13:47.743
<i>someone who's the real thing,</i>

13:47.743 --> 13:49.661
<i>that's a big deal.</i>

13:49.661 --> 13:51.705
<i>For a lot of us.</i>

13:53.207 --> 13:54.708
Look,

13:54.708 --> 13:56.502
<i>we ruffled a lot of feathers
with our rhetoric,</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:58.462
<i>so now we have to,
I don't know,</i>

13:58.462 --> 14:01.840
<i>smooth them, or whatever
the fuck you do with feathers.</i>

14:01.840 --> 14:03.175
<i>- Right.
- You'll have to meet</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:05.052
<i>with the teacher's union
and start managing them,</i>

14:05.052 --> 14:07.096
<i>considering there's no way
that we can deliver</i>

14:07.096 --> 14:08.722
<i>half of what we promised.</i>

14:08.722 --> 14:10.849
<i>Oh, and I'm setting up a tour
of the country club circuit.</i>

14:10.849 --> 14:12.017
<i>We're gonna need a lot more cash</i>

14:12.017 --> 14:13.310
<i>if we're gonna get you reelected.</i>

14:13.310 --> 14:15.020
<i>Reelected? I--
-</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:17.523
<i>I haven't even
taken office yet.</i>

14:17.523 --> 14:18.524
<i>Is that Biscuit?</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:21.610
<i>Look, I'll-I'll call you back
later, okay?</i>

Enough with the telegram bit.</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:23.755
<i>"Okay, I feel like the telegram
bit has run its course."</i>

15:23.755 --> 15:26.216

it's mostly predictable stuff.</i>

<i>Hello, Callie.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:15.849
<i>Oh, good, attitude voice.</i>

16:16.725 --> 16:18.894
<i>Fine. Never mind.</i>

16:21.563 --> 16:23.482
You should probably go, too.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.192

16:25.192 --> 16:26.985

<i>Everything okay

16:49.675 --> 16:53.428
<i>Actually, no. I might have
to break up with him.</i>

17:01.561 --> 17:04.106
<i>Is there something you want
to tell me, Mother?</i>

17:04.106 --> 17:05.357

17:05.357 --> 17:06.775
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:11.446 --> 17:13.657
<i>Please, just watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth.</i>

17:13.657 --> 17:15.659
<i>Well, that
doesn't even make sense.</i>

17:15.659 --> 17:18.745
<i>Dad deserves to know
what is going on, okay?</i>

17:18.745 --> 17:21.248
<i>What happened between
me and Adam was a mistake,</i>

17:21.248 --> 17:23.166
<i>but it's over now.</i>

17:23.166 --> 17:25.961
<i>And besides, your father
already knows, so...</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:26.920
Wait.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.380
<i>You told him?
- Yeah.</i>

17:28.380 --> 17:29.715
<i>I told him.</i>

17:29.715 --> 17:31.758
<i>Oh, my God.
How could you do that to him?</i>

17:31.758 --> 17:34.469

- You are so fucking selfish.</i>

<i>Jeff.</i>

18:06.710 --> 18:08.754
<i>So, basically,
I'm gonna be my mom.</i>

18:08.754 --> 18:11.298
<i>Great. This was fun.
- Come on.</i>

18:11.298 --> 18:14.343

18:16.011 --> 18:17.262

<i>Okay.
- You're getting better.</i>

18:41.370 --> 18:42.496
<i>It's fine.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:43.663
<i>It's worth it.</i>

18:43.663 --> 18:44.998
<i>You've been sleeping
through the night</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:46.124
<i>since we thought of that.</i>

18:46.124 --> 18:48.710
<i>It's not worth it

18:48.710 --> 18:51.296

lock me up there at night.</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:53.340

18:53.340 --> 18:55.092
<i>Yeah, okay, Rapunzel.</i>

18:55.092 --> 18:58.053
<i>It's my decision
to be up there with you.</i>

18:58.053 --> 18:59.805
<i>Not yours.</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:01.640
<i>Maybe I just want you
to tie me up.</i>

19:01.640 --> 19:03.392
<i>You ever think of that?
- Shut up.</i>

19:03.392 --> 19:06.895
Shut up. Stop.

19:10.982 --> 19:13.443
<i>You should add more herbs.</i>

<i>Okay, where the hell is Shauna

19:21.660 --> 19:23.620
<i>Seriously? Are we just
not gonna talk about</i>

19:29.251 --> 19:31.336
It's been two months.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.672
Give her some time.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.799
<i>All right?
She's still grieving.</i>

19:35.799 --> 19:39.803
<i>Yeah, or she's gone
full-on Norman Bates.</i>

19:40.345 --> 19:42.305
<i>What do you guys think
they're talking about?</i>

19:42.806 --> 19:45.016
Guys.

19:45.016 --> 19:48.019
<i>Gods of the dirt?</i>

19:59.531 --> 20:01.908
<i>Okay? You're driving us nuts.</i>

20:01.908 --> 20:02.826
<i>I wasn't singing.</i>

20:02.826 --> 20:04.244
<i>I was humming.
- Cool.</i>

20:04.244 --> 20:06.121
<i>Fucking stop.</i>

20:10.584 --> 20:12.502
How'd it start, anyway?

<i>You and Jeff?</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.422
<i>If you don't want
to talk about the future,</i>

20:15.422 --> 20:17.466

<i>That's probably
why I'm still here.</i>

20:19.551 --> 20:21.470

20:25.474 --> 20:27.642
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

20:31.313 --> 20:33.648
<i>How'd it start?</i>

20:35.484 --> 20:36.860
<i>Remember that party in Holmdel</i>

20:36.860 --> 20:39.905
<i>when the cops came
and everybody ran away?</i>

20:39.905 --> 20:42.657
<i>You know, you jumped
in Jamie Hoffman's minivan,</i>

20:42.657 --> 20:44.409
<i>and the cops were
rounding people up,</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:47.954
<i>so we ran through the backyard
into the woods.</i>

20:49.039 --> 20:51.374
<i>After that, we just...</i>

20:51.374 --> 20:53.335
<i>um, started walking.</i>

20:53.335 --> 20:55.879
<i>Keep going.</i>

<i>Well, you guys had just had
your, like, millionth fight,</i>

20:58.632 --> 21:00.383
<i>and I guess you told him
you weren't sure</i>

21:00.383 --> 21:02.511
<i>if you wanted to be
with him anymore.</i>

21:02.511 --> 21:05.055
He was pretty messed-up.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.640
<i>That is such bullshit.</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:09.267
<i>We were fighting
because he said he wasn't sure</i>

21:09.267 --> 21:10.477
<i>how much longer
he could be with someone</i>

21:10.477 --> 21:11.978
<i>who wouldn't have sex with him.</i>

21:11.978 --> 21:14.481
<i>So, yeah, I told him
I wasn't sure</i>

21:14.481 --> 21:16.858
<i>I wanted to be with someone
who felt that way.</i>

21:16.858 --> 21:19.236
<i>Jackie, I...</i>

21:19.236 --> 21:20.904
<i>I didn't know.</i>

<i>So, what happened next?</i>

21:27.911 --> 21:29.704
<i>Did he kiss you?</i>

21:32.415 --> 21:33.917
<i>Holy shit.</i>

21:33.917 --> 21:36.002
<i>You kissed him.</i>

21:37.254 --> 21:38.129
<i>Why?</i>

21:38.129 --> 21:39.673
<i>I don't know.
- Yes, you do.</i>

21:39.673 --> 21:42.217
<i>Go on, say it.</i>

21:42.217 --> 21:43.510
<i>Say it, Shauna.</i>

<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.
Shit, shit.</i>

22:21.089 --> 22:22.924
<i>No.</i>

22:31.391 --> 22:34.561
<i>I had to cut back
the rations again.</i>

22:34.561 --> 22:37.439

<i>slow, tense music</i>

<i>Uh, McDonald's,
chicken nugget department.</i>

23:44.130 --> 23:46.257
<i>I'm sorry, did you say
"chicken nugget department"?</i>

23:46.257 --> 23:47.676
<i>I sure did.</i>

23:47.676 --> 23:51.429
<i>Because I'm selling six-pieces
like it's my job, baby.</i>

23:53.056 --> 23:54.683
<i>Well, it is,
I mean, it is my job,</i>

23:54.683 --> 23:57.519

I am doing it like a boss.</i>

23:57.519 --> 24:00.188

<i>- You know where it is?
- I think so.</i>

the Jolly Hitcher.</i>

<i>Sammy, Steve. Steve, Sammy.</i>

25:06.004 --> 25:07.380
Sammy, no! Stop right there!

25:07.380 --> 25:08.840
Oh. I'm sorry, Simone.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.300
<i>I tried calling.
- You stay the fuck</i>

25:10.300 --> 25:11.801
<i>away from him.
- What?</i>

25:11.801 --> 25:14.345
<i>Okay, what's going on?</i>

25:14.888 --> 25:16.222
<i>Everything's okay, baby.</i>

25:16.222 --> 25:18.516
<i>Go wait for me over there
by the fence.</i>

25:18.516 --> 25:20.101
<i>Look, your mom and I,
we just...</i>

25:20.101 --> 25:22.228
<i>we just need to talk
for a minute. Okay?</i>

25:22.729 --> 25:25.940
<i>Looks like we got a crossed
wire situation, Sam-wich.</i>

25:25.940 --> 25:29.611
<i>Let's just do what Mommy says.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

25:31.571 --> 25:33.281
<i>I love you.</i>

25:34.908 --> 25:37.285
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

25:37.869 --> 25:39.913
<i>I found that...</i>

25:39.913 --> 25:43.291
<i>that thing in the basement.</i>

25:43.291 --> 25:45.335
<i>What thing?</i>

25:45.335 --> 25:46.419
<i>You're not well.</i>

25:46.419 --> 25:49.547
<i>And if you don't get help--
and I mean real help--</i>

25:49.547 --> 25:52.133
<i>you will never see Sammy again.
- Simone, wait.</i>

25:52.133 --> 25:54.594
<i>I have no idea
what you're talking about.</i>

25:54.594 --> 25:55.804
<i>Well, then maybe
I should put it into terms</i>

25:55.804 --> 25:57.055
<i>that you will understand.</i>

25:57.055 --> 25:59.140
<i>If you don't step down
from office</i>

25:59.140 --> 26:00.642
<i>and seek treatment
for whatever this is</i>

26:00.642 --> 26:02.018
<i>that is happening to you,</i>

26:02.018 --> 26:04.020
<i>I will have no choice
but to go to the press.</i>

26:04.020 --> 26:05.396
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

26:05.396 --> 26:06.606
<i>Jesus.</i>

26:06.606 --> 26:09.609
Come on, baby.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.654
<i>Fuck.</i>

26:12.654 --> 26:15.698
<i>tense music</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:29.087
<i>What is that?</i>

26:33.299 --> 26:35.009
<i>Javi.</i>

26:36.386 --> 26:37.804
<i>Javi. Javi.</i>

26:37.804 --> 26:40.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay..

26:40.640 --> 26:43.768
<i>It's just a fox.
It's just a fox.</i>

26:43.768 --> 26:45.270
<i>Travis, come on.</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:48.523
<i>Hey. Hey.
-</i>

26:48.523 --> 26:50.066
<i>You're good.</i>

26:50.066 --> 26:53.695
<i>Come on.
- I... Sorry. Sorry.</i>

26:59.868 --> 27:02.287
<i>We should probably
head back soon.</i>

27:02.829 --> 27:04.205
<i>It's gonna be dark.</i>

27:04.205 --> 27:06.040
<i>We need to be
searching out further</i>

27:06.040 --> 27:07.250
<i>and getting up earlier.</i>

27:07.250 --> 27:10.295
<i>Javi could've found
another cabin, or...</i>

27:10.295 --> 27:12.672
<i>I don't know, but...</i>

27:13.339 --> 27:15.884
<i>We could probably start
another hour before sunup.</i>

27:15.884 --> 27:17.719
<i>If Javi's still alive...</i>

27:20.096 --> 27:24.058
<i>I-I mean, farther out,
it makes sense.</i>

27:29.314 --> 27:31.733
<i>We should head back, yeah.
You're right.</i>

27:31.733 --> 27:33.067
<i>It's not gonna help anyone</i>

27:33.067 --> 27:35.403
<i>if we get lost out here
in the dark.</i>

27:35.403 --> 27:36.946
<i>Hang on.</i>

27:36.946 --> 27:38.907
<i>I'm gonna mark it.</i>

<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

27:45.705 --> 27:47.415
<i>Okay.</i>

27:47.415 --> 27:50.001
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:02.764 --> 28:04.474
<i>Hi. Are you the manager?</i>

28:04.474 --> 28:06.267
<i>No, I'm actually the lookout.</i>

28:06.267 --> 28:08.645
<i>My partner's in the back,
working the manager over</i>

28:08.645 --> 28:11.272
<i>until he gives up
the combination to the safe.</i>

28:11.272 --> 28:13.733
<i>We're here to steal
the Baroness's jewels.</i>

28:13.733 --> 28:15.026


28:15.026 --> 28:17.403
<i>What happened to
the woman in room 135?</i>

28:17.403 --> 28:19.739
<i>Let me check my records.</i>

28:20.698 --> 28:23.076
<i>You're not doing anything.</i>

28:23.868 --> 28:25.370
<i>Huh.</i>

28:25.370 --> 28:27.121
<i>Let me try again.</i>

28:29.123 --> 28:30.917
<i>Brunette, stunning,</i>

28:30.917 --> 28:32.543
<i>looks like she'd stab you?</i>

28:32.543 --> 28:35.630
<i>She's my best friend, and, um,
she wouldn't have left town</i>

28:35.630 --> 28:36.923
<i>without telling me,</i>

28:36.923 --> 28:38.758
<i>so something must have
happened to her.</i>

28:38.758 --> 28:41.302
<i>Something happens to all of us.</i>

28:41.886 --> 28:43.388
<i>True.</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:45.932
<i>And some of those things
can be worse than others,</i>

28:45.932 --> 28:48.017
<i>depending on our choices,</i>

28:48.017 --> 28:52.063
<i>Larry Frankowski,
65 Union Street, apartment 2B.</i>

28:53.439 --> 28:54.816
<i>Remind me, Larry,</i>

<i>is your social security number
138-00-2671,</i>

28:59.821 --> 29:01.906
<i>or is it... [scoffs]</i>

29:01.906 --> 29:03.992
<i>No. [laughs]</i>

29:03.992 --> 29:06.327
<i>I'm pretty sure that's it.</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:10.581
<i>Look, lady,
I'm gonna level with you.</i>

29:10.581 --> 29:13.084
<i>The water pressure here sucks.</i>

29:13.084 --> 29:16.462
<i>The ambiance is a heady mix
of imminent tragedy</i>

29:16.462 --> 29:20.174
<i>and broken dreams, and
we don't have cable or Wi-Fi.</i>

29:20.174 --> 29:24.721
<i>The one thing we do have
is discretion.</i>

29:24.721 --> 29:27.098
<i>You ever stay here before?</i>

29:27.098 --> 29:28.224
<i>The answer's no.</i>

29:28.224 --> 29:31.060
<i>Even if you have,
you haven't.</i>

<i>And even then,
my memory stinks</i>

29:38.943 --> 29:41.362
<i>and my handwriting's worse.</i>

29:41.362 --> 29:42.697
<i>Capisce?</i>

29:44.907 --> 29:47.869
<i>Okay. Well, you should know</i>

<i>I have two days off from work,</i>

<i>So, huh...</i>

29:57.545 --> 29:59.422
<i>I'll just wait.</i>

30:10.058 --> 30:11.350
<i>She took off.</i>

<i>Chronic?
-</i>

30:37.460 --> 30:41.756
<i>So, is... is this it? I mean,
you sure this is his?</i>

30:42.381 --> 30:44.425
Oh, it's his.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.680
<i>I've been dying just
to feel you</i>

30:49.680 --> 30:53.226
<i>By my side</i>

30:54.894 --> 30:56.687
<i>To know that you're mine</i>

<i>Hey. How do you get an art
major off your front porch?</i>

31:00.316 --> 31:03.778
<i>What?
- Pay for the pizza.</i>

31:21.337 --> 31:23.506
<i>I will pray for you</i>

31:30.763 --> 31:33.432
Uh... My God.

31:33.432 --> 31:35.768
We have to get rid of them.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.062
Someone like you

31:38.062 --> 31:40.314
<i>Did you pose for him?</i>

31:41.149 --> 31:42.525
<i>No.</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:47.446
<i>See your face
every place that I walk in</i>

31:47.446 --> 31:52.118
<i>Hear your voice
every time that I'm talking</i>

31:52.118 --> 31:54.120
<i>Are you okay?</i>

31:54.120 --> 31:55.454
<i>You will believe in me</i>

31:55.454 --> 31:57.999
<i>What are you, what are
you thinking right now?</i>

31:59.000 --> 32:00.001
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:00.001 --> 32:03.838
<i>And I will never be ignored</i>

32:05.548 --> 32:11.345
<i>The thought of you with
someone else always scared me.</i>

32:12.054 --> 32:14.515
<i>I will burn for you</i>

32:37.246 --> 32:39.832
<i>I will crawl on hands
and knees</i>

<i>What do you think now?</i>

32:41.500 --> 32:43.961
<i>Until you see</i>

32:43.961 --> 32:46.839
<i>That I like being
the way I am.</i>

32:46.839 --> 32:50.885

Hey.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.105
<i>The fuck are you doing?</i>

33:44.105 --> 33:45.273
<i>Me?</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:47.233
<i>Get away from that.
You know the rules.</i>

I'm gonna poison anyone.</i>

<i>You drew the four
this morning, Misty.</i>

33:55.241 --> 33:56.367
<i>You have to get the water.</i>

33:56.367 --> 33:57.952
But that's not fair. I...

<i>I've been doing it every day,
and it's freezing out there.</i>

34:00.788 --> 34:02.748
<i>I...</i>

34:03.749 --> 34:05.459
<i>Fine.</i>

34:18.222 --> 34:19.807
<i>Are you okay?</i>

34:19.807 --> 34:21.934
<i>Um, yeah.</i>

34:21.934 --> 34:23.811
<i>Why?</i>

34:30.151 --> 34:31.944
<i>Oh, Jeff...</i>

34:31.944 --> 34:34.989
<i>Shauna, just... please.</i>

34:36.699 --> 34:38.367
<i>Look, we got to do something
about these,</i>

34:38.367 --> 34:40.328
<i>because we can't just
take them out of here</i>

34:40.328 --> 34:43.664
<i>without somebody seeing us.</i>

34:57.470 --> 34:59.013
Okay.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.223
<i>Okay.</i>

35:22.328 --> 35:26.165
<i>You gotta give a little</i>

35:26.165 --> 35:28.376
<i>Take a little</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:33.089
<i>And let your poor heart
break a little</i>

35:33.089 --> 35:35.341
<i>That's the story of</i>

35:35.341 --> 35:39.011
<i>That's the glory of love</i>

35:39.011 --> 35:41.263
<i>My mama told me</i>

35:41.263 --> 35:42.848
<i>Oh, my God,
shut the fuck up!</i>

35:42.848 --> 35:45.267
<i>Jesus. Sorry.</i>

35:45.267 --> 35:46.852
<i>Uh, it's stuck in my head now.</i>

35:46.852 --> 35:49.397
<i>I had to go,
and sometimes singing helps,</i>

35:49.397 --> 35:51.357
<i>you know, grease the skids.</i>

35:52.691 --> 35:54.193
<i>I know it's annoying to people</i>

35:54.193 --> 35:55.611
<i>who aren't into the theater
like I am.</i>

35:55.611 --> 35:57.488
<i>Every day, I wake up
and I tell myself,</i>

35:57.488 --> 35:59.490
<i>"Crystal, stop singing
so freaking much.</i>

35:59.490 --> 36:00.866
<i>It's driving everyone bananas."</i>

36:00.866 --> 36:03.744
<i>But then I don't even realize
I started it again.</i>

36:04.662 --> 36:06.664
<i>Uh, you should try it sometime.
It helps.</i>

36:06.664 --> 36:09.542
<i>I can't sing.
- No, everyone can sing.</i>

36:09.542 --> 36:11.460
<i>You just need
a good vocal coach.</i>

36:11.460 --> 36:13.504
<i>I could teach you.</i>

36:15.423 --> 36:18.759
<i>Oh, my God.
Uh, we could harmonize.</i>

36:20.302 --> 36:22.555
<i>intriguing music</i>

36:28.185 --> 36:30.104
<i>Hey. How'd it go?</i>

36:30.104 --> 36:31.522
<i>Great.</i>

36:31.522 --> 36:33.232
<i>Except for the part
where we failed</i>

36:33.232 --> 36:36.026
<i>for the millionth day in a row.</i>

36:36.026 --> 36:39.947
<i>But... at least...</i>

36:39.947 --> 36:41.782
<i>...this.</i>

36:48.164 --> 36:50.499
<i>Wow. These are getting
pretty good.</i>

36:50.499 --> 36:52.543
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

36:52.543 --> 36:54.753
<i>Okay.</i>

37:08.517 --> 37:10.519
<i>Okay. So...</i>

37:10.519 --> 37:12.271
<i>Here?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

37:12.271 --> 37:15.274
<i>So, that's, what, like...</i>

37:15.274 --> 37:17.818
<i>seven miles in each direction?</i>

<i>at this point...</i>

37:31.499 --> 37:33.250
<i>I mean...</i>

<i>There's just no conceivable way.</i>

37:36.545 --> 37:39.006
<i>I-I know.</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:43.010
<i>But, you know, Travis.</i>

37:44.512 --> 37:46.639
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:47.556 --> 37:50.226
<i>Yeah, that's got to be tough.</i>

37:50.726 --> 37:53.437
<i>Of course she left
without telling you.</i>

37:53.437 --> 37:56.607
<i>Best friends.
Yeah, right.</i>

37:58.692 --> 38:02.112
<i>Do not cry about this, Misty.</i>
