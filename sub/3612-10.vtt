00:11.262 --> 00:12.627
Mr. Hume.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.182
My name is Zoe.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.767
I know you're disoriented. You've been
unconscious for the last three days.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.766
But you're off the IV sedation now.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.690
And I've just given you a shot
to help you wake up.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.103
Are you a nurse?

00:32.450 --> 00:35.317
You're not in the hospital anymore,
Mr. Hume. We had to move you.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.323
What? Move me? Move me where?

00:38.414 --> 00:39.699
Where's my wife?

00:40.625 --> 00:43.742
- No. Wait... You shouldn't...
- I wanna see Penny.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.248
I'm afraid that's not
gonna be possible, Desmond.

00:51.802 --> 00:52.928
You.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.004
- Mr. Hume...
- Easy.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.719
- I'll take it from here.
- You should sit.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.425
Desmond.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.809
What happened to me? Where am I?

01:07.193 --> 01:10.060
You were shot... by Benjamin Linus.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.152
Do you remember that?

01:12.823 --> 01:14.074
Yes, I remember.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.571
- I wanna talk to Penny. Penny!
- She's not here.

01:18.663 --> 01:21.905
But I assure you, both she
and your son are perfectly safe.

01:22.375 --> 01:25.412
I'm really sorry
for taking you away from them,

01:25.503 --> 01:27.539
but I didn't have a chance
to explain, and...

01:28.339 --> 01:31.172
...if| had, you never
would've come with me.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.211
Come with you?

01:34.720 --> 01:35.971
Come with you where?

01:38.683 --> 01:40.264
I brought you back to the island.

01:43.521 --> 01:46.354
I... can't imagine
how you must be feeling.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.514
But if you'll give me
a chance to explain...

01:54.824 --> 01:57.281
- Damn it! Don't hurt him!
- You take me back!

01:57.368 --> 02:00.735
- You take me back right now, you hear?!
- I can't take you back.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.372
The island isn't done with you yet.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.168
What is Desmond doing here?

02:14.677 --> 02:17.965
It will be easier for me to show you
than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.465
Take him to the generator room.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.173
I'll be along with Hume
so we can start the test.

02:22.268 --> 02:24.600
Charles, that test
isn't scheduled till tomorrow.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.394
I know when it's scheduled.
Get them ready now.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.085
Come on. No time for sightseeing.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.664
Double-check inside.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.967
- They're bringing Hume down now.
- What?!

03:06.062 --> 03:08.348
You heard me. We are go right now.
What's your time frame?

03:08.439 --> 03:11.727
We're not close to being ready.
This generator hasn't run in 20 years.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.398
- How am l...?
- Widmore doesn't want to wait.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.272
- What are you doing?
- Running a test.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.069
- What kind of test?
- Let's see where we are.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.238
Can we get a functioning
EM field going?

03:19.325 --> 03:22.317
- Sure thing.
- Try a power test. Generator to full.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.742
- OK.
- OK.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.654
Here we go. On my count.

03:26.749 --> 03:30.082
Three... two... one.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.284
And power on.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.215
Great.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.918
We probably got a faulty
contact somewhere. Find it.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.174
Simmons, go check the circuits
on the solenoids.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.641
- Yes, sir.
- Try it again.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.677
Guess what, Angstrom?
You're going in there next.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.539
Foundiﬂ
It's a bad breaker on the genny.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.496
- Bringing it back online now.
- No!

04:22.471 --> 04:23.677
No!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.005
Turn it off! Turn it off!

04:41.407 --> 04:42.817
Oh, my God.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.285
Zoe.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.538
- Are we ready?
- Let's go.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.446
Stop.

05:37.755 --> 05:39.336
You can take him now. Thank you.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.412
Yes, sir.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.086
Put him inside.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.006
What the hell are you doing?!

05:53.729 --> 05:55.560
I know how this looks, Desmond.

05:55.648 --> 05:58.355
But if everything I've been
told about you is true,

05:58.442 --> 05:59.943
you'll be perfectly fine.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.609
You don't have any metal on you,
do you? Keys? Change?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.106
Of course he doesn't, you idiot.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.774
I hate to resort to forcing
this upon you, Desmond...

06:10.579 --> 06:11.819
...but once it's over...

06:12.998 --> 06:15.330
...l'm going to ask you
to make a sacrifice.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.955
And I hope, for all our sakes,
you'll help me.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.461
Sacrifice?

06:22.925 --> 06:24.961
What the bloody hell
do you know about sacrifice?

06:28.722 --> 06:32.010
My son died here
for the sake of this island.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.935
Your wife, my own daughter, hates me.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.013
And I've never even met my grandson.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.817
But if you won't help me, Desmond,
all of it will be for nothing.

06:45.573 --> 06:48.155
Penny, your son, and everyone else

06:49.118 --> 06:51.234
will be gone... forever.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.932
All right. Turn it on.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.765
No. If you want me to help you
with whatever you're doing here,

07:21.859 --> 07:24.316
- you need to explain to me...
- That man is the only person

07:24.403 --> 07:25.859
I'm aware of in the world

07:25.946 --> 07:28.779
who has survived a catastrophic
electromagnetic event.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.859
I need to know that he can do it again,
or we all die.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.701
Turn it on.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.721
- Do we have full power?
- Yeah, but...

08:02.775 --> 08:03.810
Let me out!

08:12.534 --> 08:14.399
Let me out of here, you bastards!

08:14.495 --> 08:16.076
Let me out!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.994
Let me out of here!

08:22.252 --> 08:23.753
Let me out of here!

08:50.239 --> 08:54.323
- lt's carousel four.
- Sorry?

08:55.411 --> 08:57.618
- You were on the Sydney flight, right?
- Yeah.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.447
Our bags are on carousel four.
I double-checked at the counter.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.285
Thank you.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.296
Hang on. I've got it. I got it.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.258
Thank you so much.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.213
Pleasure.

09:18.308 --> 09:22.847
- Do you have any more bags?
- No. That's it, thank God.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.474
Boy or a girl?

09:26.191 --> 09:29.683
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
- No. It's fine.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.734
| just don't know what it is.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.029
All right. Well, you're braver than I.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.573
I'm not a big fan of surprises.

09:39.455 --> 09:40.695
Excuse me. That's mine.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.840
So... have you got someone meeting you?

09:54.511 --> 09:58.379
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe they got
the... flights mixed up or something.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.260
Because I've got a car picking me up.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.557
If you need a ride, I'd be happy
to give you a lift.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.477
Oh, no, no, no. That's really sweet
of you, but I'm good.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.350
- There's cabs, so...
- All right. Yeah.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.683
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.939
A boy.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.770
- What?
- I bet it's a boy.

10:14.865 --> 10:19.575
Please note the television monitors
located at the baggage claim entrance.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.738
Detailed baggage claim information
on all arriving flights...

10:30.255 --> 10:31.370
Looks like I'm with you.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.422
Mr. Hume. Hello.
Let me grab that for you.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.421
- Thank you.
- My name is George.

10:36.512 --> 10:37.547
Nice to meet you.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.129
So I will take you back to your hotel?

10:40.224 --> 10:42.431
- The office.
- Office. Wonderful.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.758
This way, please.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.346
So you flew in from Sydney, huh?

10:49.441 --> 10:50.851
Yeah. That's right.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.067
And what were you doing down under?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.437
l was closing a deal for the boss.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.694
Good for you. Congratulations.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.743
If you need anything at all
while you're in town, I know everyone.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.367
If you need a reservation,
you just pick a restaurant.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.448
The room service at the hotel
is excellent. Thank you.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.919
You looking for some company?

11:13.298 --> 11:15.880
Well, I noticed that you weren't
wearing a wedding band,

11:15.968 --> 11:20.712
and there are a lot of lovely ladies
offering their... companionship.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.673
I'm not looking for any companionship.
I'm here to work.

11:25.143 --> 11:29.182
Guess that's why you're the boss's
right-hand man, and I am the driver.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.105
OK. Got it.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.779
Good morning, Mr. Hume.
How was your flight?

11:43.871 --> 11:45.702
- Lovely. Thank you.
- He said to send you right in.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.074
Thank you.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.380
- Charles.
- Hello, Desmond.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.132
- Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.
- Thank you.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.527
I don't give a bloody damn what he did
or how much it's going to cost.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.447
Just get him arraigned
and get him out of there.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.326
Sorry, Desmond.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.326
Our celebration of the Australian deal
is gonna have to be cut short.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.282
You are aware that my son is a musician?

12:32.377 --> 12:34.754
Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.294
Yeah, he is, quite.

12:37.215 --> 12:40.207
Anyway, my wife is putting together
one of her charity events,

12:40.302 --> 12:42.964
and the boy had the crazy idea

12:43.055 --> 12:45.717
to combine classical music
with modern rock.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.678
Have you heard of a band
called Drive Shaft?

12:49.186 --> 12:50.722
No, can't say l have.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.805
Their bass guitarist overdosed
and got himself arrested.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.812
And now if I don't get
this junkie to my wife's event,

12:57.903 --> 13:01.236
she will, simply put, destroy me.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.239
- So you want me to baby-sit him.
- I know it's beneath you,

13:04.326 --> 13:06.738
but I need someone I can trust
to do the job right.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.489
Say no more, Charles. It's done.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.698
You really do have the life, son.

13:14.086 --> 13:16.668
No family, no commitments.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.329
To be free of attachments.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.382
I'm a blessed man, sir.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.257
No, it is I who am blessed
to have you in my employ.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.383
A drink to celebrate
your indispensability.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.520
That's your 60-year-old scotch, Charles.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.069
Nothing's too good for you.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.759
- Mr. Hume?
- That's right.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.761
Bail's all been taken care of.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.472
- He's not allowed to leave the state.
- Right.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.355
Mr. Pace, l'm Desmond Hume.
Charles Widmore sent me...

14:24.448 --> 14:26.359
Hey. Where you going?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.695
He's all yours.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.369
Hey!

14:40.964 --> 14:44.127
What's wrong with you?! ldiot!

14:45.260 --> 14:46.591
Come on.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.311
Yeah, I'll have whatever he's having.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.312
One drink, then we go.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.901
So, what's your job then,
to baby-sit me?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.654
What are you?
Mr. Widmore's chief lackey?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.535
- Henchman?
- No title.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.244
- Plenty of perks, though.
- Such as?

15:19.002 --> 15:20.503
| get to meet charming people.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.166
Well... cheers, then.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.845
Tell me, Perky. Are you happy?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.350
Quite.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.349
No, you're not.

15:37.104 --> 15:41.063
Well, I've got a great job,
lots of money, travel the world.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.686
- Why wouldn't I be happy?
- Have you ever been in love?

15:44.361 --> 15:47.319
- Thousands of times.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

15:47.405 --> 15:52.024
I'm talking about spectacular,
consciousness-altering love.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.989
Do you know what that looks like?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.617
I wasn't aware that
love looked like anything.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.915
I've seen it, mate,
on the plane back from Sydney.

16:01.545 --> 16:02.876
Is that so?

16:03.755 --> 16:07.088
Well, we were on the same flight,
so... maybe I saw it too.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.630
Trust me. You didn't.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.674
No? Enlighten me.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.387
There was this woman

16:18.478 --> 16:20.014
two rows in front of me,

16:20.105 --> 16:23.313
in handcuffs, sittin' with a cop.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.393
He looked at me, knew I was holding.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.396
lfl didn't take action, I'd be caught.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.159
So I got up, went to the lav.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.907
Proceeded to eliminate the evidence
by swallowing my stash.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.829
And at that exact moment,
we hit turbulence.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.620
lchoked.

16:48.675 --> 16:53.294
The entire bag of heroin
is stuck in my throat.

16:53.388 --> 16:57.051
It's over. Everything starts to go dark.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.383
l'm slippin' into the abyss, and then...

16:59.936 --> 17:02.518
.Hlsee”.heh

17:03.982 --> 17:05.267
"Her"?

17:06.067 --> 17:09.059
A woman. Blonde.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.985
Rapturously beautiful.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.324
And I know her.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.823
We're together.

17:15.911 --> 17:19.369
It's like... we've always been, and...

17:20.207 --> 17:21.538
...always will be.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.452
This...

17:25.086 --> 17:26.587
...feeling, this...

17:28.798 --> 17:29.833
...love.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.086
And just as I'm about
to be engulfed by it...

17:37.515 --> 17:39.380
...| open my eyes,

17:39.476 --> 17:43.139
and this sodding idiot
is standing there,

17:43.230 --> 17:45.095
asking me if I'm OK.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.854
But I saw it. Just for a moment,
I saw what it looked like.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.649
Well, that's just...

17:54.741 --> 17:55.821
...poetry, brother.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.692
You should write a song about that.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're saying.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.164
Poor suicidal rock star.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.585
But I've seen something real.
I've seen the truth.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.537
No, that's not the truth.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.415
You wanna know the real truth, Pace?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.671
Right now you have a choice.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.344
You can keep on drinkin',
or you can come with me.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.766
Now before you make your choice,
realize that if you stay here,

18:22.852 --> 18:27.312
it will very likely result in the
extermination of your musical career.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.064
And if I go with you?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.936
Twenty minutes, you'll be luxuriating
in a five-star hotel,

18:34.030 --> 18:35.645
right on the harbor front.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.823
Charles Widmore, one of the most
powerful men in this town,

18:38.910 --> 18:40.286
will owe you a favor.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.363
Doesn't really seem like a choice.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.575
There's always a choice, brother.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.968
That's my band.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.590
Drive Shaft.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.930
Our first single.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.063
The beginning of everything great.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.363
You like it?

19:19.451 --> 19:21.407
Sure. For what it is.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.403
| feel sorry for you, mate.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.416
You think you're happy.
You think you got it all.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.627
This... your life.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.997
But you don't.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.502
Why, because none of it's real?

19:39.304 --> 19:42.888
All right, Mr. Hume.
How about I offer you a choice?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.510
What's that?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.184
I can either show you
what I'm talking about,

19:48.980 --> 19:50.516
or you can get out of the car.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.776
Why in God's name
would I want to get out of...

20:20.637 --> 20:23.253
Charlie! Charlie!

20:23.848 --> 20:24.837
Come on!

21:37.714 --> 21:40.126
Come on! Come on!

21:46.306 --> 21:47.637
Come on, damn it!

21:53.271 --> 21:57.856
Radiology tech to CPA. RTto CPA please.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.979
You sustained a pretty bad bump
in your accident. Any nausea?

22:01.488 --> 22:03.774
- Nope.
- Double vision?

22:03.865 --> 22:06.197
No. I need to find the man
that l was brought in here with.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.945
How about hallucinations?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.287
What do you mean?

22:13.374 --> 22:15.501
Hallucinations.
Seeing things that aren't there.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.835
I'm not sure.

22:23.927 --> 22:28.546
Your CAT scan was inconclusive. I'm
gonna send you downstairs for an MRI.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.428
No, I don't have time for this. I need
to find the man I came in here with.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.977
You're not finding anyone till we know
what's going on inside your brain.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.603
Are you wearing any metal,
carrying keys or change?

22:40.693 --> 22:43.856
Any metal inside your body,
pacemakers, pins, bullets?

22:43.947 --> 22:46.359
- Steel plate inside of your head?
- No, nothing.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.446
| see you didn't list an emergency
contact. No friends or family?

22:53.122 --> 22:55.454
Just put down my employer,
Charles Widmore.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.209
This machine is super loud.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.957
You're gonna want these.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.586
- And you need the button.
- Button?

23:09.681 --> 23:12.468
Panic button.
You need to stop, press it.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.892
Try not to, 'cause we'll have to start
all over again from the beginning.

23:15.979 --> 23:19.471
I'll be in that booth over there. You'll
be able to hear me, 30 minutes, OK?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.841
OK, here we go.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.199
Desmond?

24:15.163 --> 24:16.369
Hey!

24:16.456 --> 24:17.741
Hey, let me out of here!

24:18.791 --> 24:21.077
Hey! Hey!

24:22.754 --> 24:23.869
What? Are you all right?

24:23.963 --> 24:25.544
I need to find the man
I came in here with.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.962
I need to find the man
I came in here with.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.758
His name is Charlie Pace.
He came in an hour ago.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.509
If you'd give me his room number...

24:35.600 --> 24:37.761
If you're not a relative,
that's confidential information.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.764
We were in an accident together.
I need to see him.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.766
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.315
Hey. Excuse me.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.946
We were on the same
Oceanic flight from Sydney.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.319
Yeah, yeah.
You were sitting next to me.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.527
- Desmond, right?
- That's right.

24:57.622 --> 25:01.365
I wonder if you can help me. I need
to find someone. He was on our plane.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.496
- He's somewhere in the hospital.
- Wait. He was on our plane,

25:04.587 --> 25:06.123
and now he's in the hospital?

25:06.214 --> 25:08.956
None of this matters!
None of this matters!

25:09.050 --> 25:11.086
- Sir, please! Stop!
- Take it easy.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.529
- Why you running?
- No one here can help me.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.329
- Let me go.
- Why'd you try and kill me?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.453
I didn't try and kill you.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.250
l was trying to show you something.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.873
Show me something?
Show me your hand.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.580
- What?
- Your hand. Show me your bloody hands.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.676
You saw something, didn't you?

25:53.469 --> 25:54.845
In the water.

25:55.763 --> 25:59.176
What was it? What are
you looking for, mate?

26:02.353 --> 26:04.890
- Who's Penny?
- I don't know.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.147
- You felt it, didn't you?
- I didn't feel anything.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.270
Then why are you accosting
a man in a dressing gown?

26:14.365 --> 26:15.741
All right, come on. We're leaving.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.109
You think I'm gonna go
play a rock concert after this?

26:20.204 --> 26:22.411
This doesn't matter.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.908
None of this matters.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.326
All that matters is that we felt it.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.332
You wanna try and stop me? Good luck.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.377
Hey. Where you going?

26:34.469 --> 26:37.381
If I were you,
I'd stop worrying about me

26:38.347 --> 26:39.928
and start looking for Penny.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.855
What do you mean, "He's gone"?

26:54.447 --> 26:57.109
He escaped. He knocked over
a doctor with a bloody crash cart

26:57.200 --> 26:59.236
- and then ran out of hospital.
- And you let him go?

26:59.327 --> 27:02.239
He's a junkie who drove my car
into the ocean, Charles.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.787
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.115
And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.917
But when I give you a job to do,
I expect you to do it.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.962
With all due respect, sir,
it's just a bloody concert.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.462
I'll tell you what, Desmond.
If you can't deliver Pace,

27:16.552 --> 27:20.090
why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore
it's only a bloody concert?

27:34.070 --> 27:36.061
Mr. Hume.

27:40.868 --> 27:44.531
So you've never met
the boss's wife, huh?

27:46.040 --> 27:48.281
- No.
- Good luck.

27:53.923 --> 27:57.791
Please tell me, how is it
that someone in your line of work

27:57.885 --> 28:02.800
is not aware that the butter knife
is placed handle to the right?

28:02.890 --> 28:05.302
Blade facing left just so.

28:06.978 --> 28:08.468
For God's sake.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.474
- Mrs. Widmore?
- Yes?

28:16.237 --> 28:19.229
My name is Desmond Hume.
| work for your husband.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.023
Of course, Mr. Hume.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.279
Charles has told me so much about you.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.036
It's a travesty
we haven't met before.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.910
Well, it's about time.

28:30.001 --> 28:34.461
- The feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.
- Oh, please. lt's Eloise.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.503
Eloise.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.879
So, what crisis forced Charles

28:39.969 --> 28:44.838
to send his best fix-it man
into the bowels of charity balls?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.719
Well, Eloise...

28:47.810 --> 28:52.304
I'm deeply sorry,
but it appears as if Drive Shaft

28:52.398 --> 28:55.890
won't be able to perform
alongside your son.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.521
I take full responsibility...

28:58.195 --> 28:59.571
Don't worry about it.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.525
- Excuse me?
- My son will understand.

29:05.620 --> 29:09.659
I suppose if one employs
so-called rock stars,

29:09.749 --> 29:13.492
a certain unpredictability
comes with the territory.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.751
- You're not angry?
- Oh, not at all, dear.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.549
What happened, happened.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.882
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

29:25.973 --> 29:28.214
for coming and telling me in person.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.142
- A pleasure meeting you.
- And you. Thank you.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.810
Center that flower arrangement, please.

29:33.898 --> 29:36.765
- Have a good evening.
- Thank you.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.942
Leifer, Stephanie, plus two.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.860
Markey, Mary, plus one.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.688
Milton, Penny, solo.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.904
- Pepper, Nicholas, plus one.
- Excuse me.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.610
I'm sorry.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.368
- Did you just say "Penny"?
- And who are you?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.290
| work for Mr. Widmore.
May | see the list?

29:55.378 --> 29:57.869
You absolutely may not.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.125
That list is confidential.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.549
Begging your pardon, l'm entrusted
with confidential items every day...

30:03.636 --> 30:05.627
Are you questioning me?

30:06.681 --> 30:09.639
No, I... just want to look
at one name on that list.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.102
- And if that's a problem...
- Come with me.

30:20.695 --> 30:23.186
Out, everyone. Now.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.568
Look, I'm sorry if I've
overstepped my bounds, but I just...

30:26.659 --> 30:28.900
Stop talking, Hume.

30:29.286 --> 30:32.323
I've heard what you've had to say.
Now you listen to me.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.161
I want you to stop.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.997
Stop? Stop what?

30:39.088 --> 30:41.204
Someone has clearly affected
the way you see things.

30:41.298 --> 30:45.962
This is a serious problem.
It is, in fact, a violation.

30:46.053 --> 30:50.342
So whatever you're doing, whatever it is
you think you're looking for,

30:52.018 --> 30:54.430
you need to stop looking for it.

30:58.024 --> 31:03.018
Do you... do you know what
I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

31:03.112 --> 31:04.977
I don't know why you're
looking for anything.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.403
You have the perfect life.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.742
On top of it,
you've managed to attain

31:08.826 --> 31:11.533
the thing you wanted
more than anything,

31:11.620 --> 31:13.451
my husband's approval.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.864
How do you know what I want?

31:17.585 --> 31:20.076
Because I bloody do.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.957
I need to see that list...

31:24.133 --> 31:25.919
Or you need to tell me why I can't.

31:26.010 --> 31:30.128
You can't because you're
not ready yet, Desmond.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.673
Ready? Ready for what?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.235
That bad?

31:53.954 --> 31:55.490
Is there any alcohol in this car?

31:56.499 --> 31:59.161
Oh, yeah. Whatever you need.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.996
So... Where to, Mr. Hume?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.507
Just drive, George.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.595
- Mr. Hume.
- Yes?

32:17.686 --> 32:20.018
My name is Daniel.
Daniel Widmore.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.852
We need to talk.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.151
Look, Mr. Widmore...

32:31.242 --> 32:32.948
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.775
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.282
Dan, look, if this
is about Charlie Pace

32:37.373 --> 32:40.865
not being able to perform with you,
I'm very sorry.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.743
Do you believe in love
at first sight, Mr. Hume?

32:48.384 --> 32:49.715
Excuse me?

32:50.928 --> 32:54.295
The first time I saw her, l was walking
through this museum a few weeks ago.

32:55.224 --> 32:57.715
She works here.
She was on her lunch break.

32:58.727 --> 32:59.978
She was eating a chocolate bar.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.684
She has these incredible
blue, blue eyes, red hair.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.354
And as soon as I saw her,

33:07.444 --> 33:10.186
right in that moment, it was like...

33:12.575 --> 33:14.315
It was like I already loved her.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.279
And that's when things got weird.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.075
That same night
after I saw that woman...

33:26.881 --> 33:28.621
I woke up and I wrote this.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.678
So, what is it?

33:37.558 --> 33:39.924
I'm a musician.
I have no idea.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.344
So I took it to a friend of mine
at Caltech. He's a math whiz.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.430
He said this is quantum mechanics.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.688
He said these equations
are so advanced

33:49.778 --> 33:52.861
that only someone who'd been
studying physics their entire life

33:52.948 --> 33:55.610
- could've come up with them.
- So...

33:57.536 --> 33:59.276
So, what do they mean?

33:59.371 --> 34:03.034
OK, imagine something terrible
is about to happen,

34:03.125 --> 34:04.581
something catastrophic.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.533
And the only way
to stop it from happening

34:06.629 --> 34:08.335
was by...

34:08.422 --> 34:10.788
...releasing a huge amount of energy.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.041
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.842
You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?

34:18.933 --> 34:19.968
Just listen.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.142
What if this, all this...

34:24.230 --> 34:26.471
What if this wasn't supposed
to be our life?

34:28.734 --> 34:32.101
What if we had some other life,

34:32.196 --> 34:35.688
and for some reason,
we changed things?

34:40.246 --> 34:42.828
I don't want to set off
a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.335
I think I already did.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.212
Listen, mate...

34:56.303 --> 34:59.386
I don't know what any of this
has to do with me. So...

34:59.473 --> 35:01.680
Why did you ask my mother
about a woman named Penny?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.270
It happened to you too, didn't it?

35:11.860 --> 35:13.066
You felt it.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.113
I don't know...

35:20.536 --> 35:21.946
I don't know what I felt.

35:22.496 --> 35:24.987
Yes, you do.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.448
You felt love.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.586
That's impossible because
I don't know anything about this woman.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.756
I don't know...
I don't know where she is.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.549
I don't even know if she exists.

35:38.887 --> 35:39.876
She's...

35:43.559 --> 35:44.844
She's an idea.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.761
No, Mr. Hume.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.557
She's my half-sister.

35:58.115 --> 36:01.232
And I can tell you exactly where
and when you can find her.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.082
Hi.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.243
Excuse me?

36:57.966 --> 36:59.001
Yeah?

37:01.845 --> 37:03.005
Are you Penny?

37:05.766 --> 37:06.801
Yes.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.217
Hello.

37:13.649 --> 37:14.809
l'm Desmond.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.398
Hi.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.660
Checking it now.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.620
He's OK.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.255
Indeed, he is.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.671
How are you, Desmond?
How are you feeling?

37:48.684 --> 37:49.719
Fine.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.769
How long was I unconscious for?

37:54.857 --> 37:56.768
No more than a few seconds.

38:00.863 --> 38:02.194
Will you help me up, please?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.776
I'm really sorry we had
to do this to you, Desmond.

38:08.871 --> 38:13.365
But as I told you, your...
talent is vital to our mission.

38:13.459 --> 38:14.915
So if you just let me explain...

38:15.002 --> 38:17.414
It's all right. I understand.

38:19.882 --> 38:22.794
- What?
- I said I understand.

38:25.179 --> 38:28.091
You brought me to the island
to do something very important.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.428
- Yeah.
- When do we start?

38:45.616 --> 38:48.983
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

38:50.162 --> 38:51.777
What I mean is 20 minutes ago,

38:51.872 --> 38:54.705
you were beating the crap out
of Widmore with an IV stand,

38:54.791 --> 38:57.123
and now you're Mr. Cooperative.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.661
A lot can happen in 20 minutes.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.999
Sure, it can.
That thing fried your brain.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.178
- Did it?
- Whatever.

39:10.766 --> 39:12.677
Doesn't change that you're gonna...

39:17.064 --> 39:18.270
Run.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.851
Desmond, I don't have time to explain,

39:24.947 --> 39:27.780
but these people
are extremely dangerous.

39:27.866 --> 39:28.981
We need to go now.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.613
Aye, of course.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.868
Lead the way.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.453
Hello? You OK?

39:49.721 --> 39:52.463
- What happened?
- Well, I shook your hand,

39:52.558 --> 39:55.345
and then you fainted.
I must have quite an effect on you.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.643
Aye. Aye, you must have.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.475
Have we met before?

40:07.114 --> 40:09.571
I think we'd remember it if we had.

40:09.658 --> 40:11.114
Yeah.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.242
Well, as long as you're sure
you're all right...

40:14.329 --> 40:15.614
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.665
Hey, listen...

40:18.667 --> 40:20.373
Would you like to go for a coffee?

40:22.170 --> 40:23.159
What, now?

40:24.256 --> 40:26.121
I'm a sweaty mess.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.798
| just fainted in front of you.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.551
I'd say we're even.

40:35.684 --> 40:38.426
There's a coffee shop on the corner
of Sweetzer and Melrose.

40:39.896 --> 40:44.560
- I'll meet you there in an hour.
- Absolutely.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.518
- OK.
- OK.

41:23.315 --> 41:26.478
So... did you find
what you were looking for?

41:29.905 --> 41:31.395
Yes, George, I did.

41:35.577 --> 41:38.319
- Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer.
- You got it.

41:38.413 --> 41:41.280
And if there's anything else
I can do for you, Mr. Hume,

41:41.375 --> 41:42.615
you just name it.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.246
Actually, there is one thing, George.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.627
Can you get me the manifest
from my flight from Sydney?

41:54.721 --> 41:56.382
Oceanic 815.

41:56.807 --> 41:58.422
Just the names of the passengers.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.931
Sure, I can.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.807
Do you mind if! ask you
what you need it for?

42:08.985 --> 42:10.816
| just need to show them something.
