Everyone has
a date to the prom but me.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.502
I am the only one.

00:09.612 --> 00:11.502
Sue, I'm sure you're not
the only one.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.588
No, I am. It's true.

00:13.677 --> 00:16.651
You know, I heard that Beyoncé
never got asked to her prom.

00:17.387 --> 00:18.685
Really?

00:18.782 --> 00:21.073
<i>I had no idea if that was true.</i>

00:21.153 --> 00:22.632
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's certainly possible.</i>

00:22.780 --> 00:24.947
<i>You don't come out of the womb</i>
<i>lookin' like Beyoncé.</i>

00:25.064 --> 00:26.856
<i>She could've been awkward</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

00:27.085 --> 00:28.717
<i>What kind of name is "Beyoncé"?</i>

00:28.824 --> 00:30.904
<i>Is it French or did her parents</i>
<i>just make it up?</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:32.381
<i>Oh, I wish</i>
<i>I could speak French.</i>

00:32.465 --> 00:33.885
<i>God knows when I'd use it.</i>

00:33.962 --> 00:37.144
<i>But still, sometimes it's just</i>
<i>nice to be able to do stuff.</i>

00:37.971 --> 00:40.220
<i>Oh, my God. Your daughter is</i>
<i>pouring out her heart to you.</i>

00:40.349 --> 00:41.600
<i>Listen! Focus!</i>

00:41.668 --> 00:42.788
<i>Pay attention!</i>

00:42.872 --> 00:45.991
That is something
I've never told anyone ever.

00:46.569 --> 00:47.970
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>She stopped talking.</i>

00:48.056 --> 00:48.891
<i>Say something.</i>

00:48.978 --> 00:50.158
<i>Take a shot.</i>

00:50.677 --> 00:53.467
Honey, I'm sure you will.

00:53.568 --> 00:56.558
Oh. Thanks, mom.

00:57.102 --> 00:58.273
<i>God, I'm good.</i>

00:59.573 --> 01:02.307
Axl, did you have Mrs. Danner
for sixth-grade English?

01:02.502 --> 01:04.759
Grandma arms, slight mustache?

01:04.924 --> 01:06.081
Yeah, I remember her.

01:06.207 --> 01:08.400
Well, she won't let us write
a normal book report --

01:08.511 --> 01:11.601
says we have to be creative
and "Think outside the book."

01:11.702 --> 01:12.425
I hate this.

01:12.521 --> 01:13.853
If they want us to think
outside the box,

01:13.943 --> 01:15.953
they should tell us
exactly how.

01:16.069 --> 01:18.657
Oh, yeah, I remember
that project.

01:18.741 --> 01:19.909
I did awesome on that.

01:19.973 --> 01:21.403
So you'll help me with mine?

01:21.513 --> 01:23.883
No, I was just telling you
how awesome I am.

01:23.986 --> 01:25.686
Hey, who helped you
drop all those classes

01:25.786 --> 01:27.469
so you wouldn't fail
out of school?

01:27.563 --> 01:28.862
And who allowed himself
to be farted on

01:28.943 --> 01:31.277
for the promise of a prize
that never came?

01:31.444 --> 01:33.922
As far as little brothers go,
you hit the jackpot.

01:34.057 --> 01:36.843
So, come on,
help a brother out.

01:39.216 --> 01:41.023
Sue, I need to talk to you
for a minute.

01:41.742 --> 01:43.648
Enjoy your potato.

01:46.329 --> 01:47.448
Oh, no.

01:47.551 --> 01:49.389
Am I over-chiving again?

01:49.519 --> 01:51.000
No, it's not about the chives.

01:51.085 --> 01:52.674
Although, you know
with the chives, less is more.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.201
This is non-work related.

01:54.377 --> 01:56.562
I'm gonna take off
my assistant-manager hat.

01:56.709 --> 01:57.638
I'm gonna talk to you

01:57.721 --> 01:59.691
as a fellow student
of Orson High --

01:59.851 --> 02:01.189
and a man.

02:01.943 --> 02:07.995
Anyway, I would like you
to accompany me to the prom.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.366
Really?

02:11.466 --> 02:12.741
Yes!
I'm going to prom!

02:12.835 --> 02:14.519
Whoo!

02:15.376 --> 02:16.212
Now back to work.

02:16.293 --> 02:17.748
Yes.

02:18.726 --> 02:21.163
<i>Dr. Oz says</i>
<i>sitting is the new smoking,</i>

02:21.274 --> 02:24.119
<i>so Mike and I decided to</i>
<i>haul our butts off the couch</i>

02:24.205 --> 02:25.475
<i>and take a walk.</i>

02:25.552 --> 02:27.530
<i>And while we may no longer</i>
<i>be dying from sitting,</i>

02:27.635 --> 02:31.214
<i>dying from boredom</i>
<i>was definitely a possibility.</i>

02:33.763 --> 02:36.633
<i>But then something amazing</i>
<i>happened -- well, someone.</i>

02:36.725 --> 02:37.518
<i>Well, someones.</i>

02:37.617 --> 02:39.311
<i>I'm saying</i>
<i>we ran into other people.</i>

02:39.449 --> 02:42.826
Hey! Vicki
from Mrs. Keats' class.

02:42.911 --> 02:44.596
Remember we sat next to each
other at back to school night?

02:44.714 --> 02:47.333
Yeah, thanks so much for
waking me up when I fell asleep.

02:47.409 --> 02:48.606
No problem.

02:48.698 --> 02:49.749
Hey, this is my husband, Mike.

02:49.824 --> 02:51.435
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my husband, Dale.

02:51.493 --> 02:52.157
Hey, I'm Dale.

02:56.046 --> 03:00.405
So, we get to my sister's house,
and we can't work <i> anything.</i>

03:00.505 --> 03:02.118
18 remotes --
we couldn't turn on the TV.

03:02.197 --> 03:04.310
It was like the whole house
was smarter than us.

03:04.411 --> 03:07.538
I swear, at one point, I think I
heard the oven laughing at me.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.463
- You work at Orson Quarry?
- Yeah.

03:09.546 --> 03:10.430
What's that like?

03:10.514 --> 03:12.862
Oh, well, have you seen "The Flintstones"?

03:12.968 --> 03:14.273
It's pretty much like that.

03:14.349 --> 03:15.291
Except at the end of the day,

03:15.361 --> 03:17.030
we <i> don't</i> slide down
the tail of a dinosaur.

03:17.096 --> 03:17.858
Oh, that's a bummer.

03:17.993 --> 03:19.070
Yeah.

03:19.139 --> 03:19.975
I hate to disappoint you.

03:21.176 --> 03:22.333
Well, this is our stop.

03:22.415 --> 03:23.277
- Oh.
- Oh.

03:23.379 --> 03:24.977
- This was great, guys.
- Yeah, do it again.

03:25.073 --> 03:26.489
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

03:26.584 --> 03:27.851
- Great.
- Take care.

03:27.949 --> 03:29.212
Bye!

03:29.727 --> 03:31.076
Well, that was pathetic.

03:31.159 --> 03:32.392
What do you mean?
I had fun.

03:32.467 --> 03:34.747
Yeah, of course you did, Mike.
You weren't talking to me.

03:34.821 --> 03:37.917
Hey, you were chattin' it up
pretty good with Dale yourself.

03:38.004 --> 03:39.656
It was like a one-woman show
back there.

03:39.754 --> 03:43.142
Tell me about it.
I was adorable -- witty, clever.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.030
I have never felt so alive.

03:45.130 --> 03:46.174
And <i> you?</i>

03:46.271 --> 03:47.960
You're totally bringing it
for Vicki.

03:48.100 --> 03:48.589
Eh.

03:48.681 --> 03:50.611
Yeah, you were talkative,
you were smiling.

03:50.696 --> 03:51.556
Don't you get it?

03:51.649 --> 03:54.345
That walk proves
that we can be fun and charming.

03:54.513 --> 03:56.388
But we shouldn't just bring it
for other people.

03:56.499 --> 03:58.243
We should bring it
for each other.

03:58.376 --> 03:59.072
Let's try it.

03:59.161 --> 04:00.824
Let's be interesting
for each other.

04:01.182 --> 04:01.833
Now?

04:01.925 --> 04:04.305
No, I'm tired now,
but we'll hit it hard tomorrow.

04:07.258 --> 04:08.847
I still don't get
what we're doing.

04:08.935 --> 04:10.578
Trust me.
It's gonna be awesome.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.077
You start with
the first book you ever read,

04:12.192 --> 04:14.614
then go all the way
to the last book you've read.

04:14.705 --> 04:16.904
It's your whole life's
journey in books.

04:16.998 --> 04:19.647
Then we knock them down like
dominos, video it,

04:19.762 --> 04:22.201
you show it in class --
"Boom!" -- they go nuts.

04:22.299 --> 04:23.236
Guaranteed A.

04:23.325 --> 04:24.013
But that doesn't have

04:24.115 --> 04:26.030
anything to do with
"The Old Man And The Sea."

04:26.103 --> 04:28.084
See? That's
your problem, Brick.

04:28.195 --> 04:29.784
You are a rigid thinker.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.761
That's why I'm gonna end up
ruling the world.

04:31.865 --> 04:34.999
All the big-time rich guys --
Steve Jobs...

04:36.273 --> 04:37.178
other guys --

04:37.295 --> 04:40.200
they're all creative thinkers,
risk-takers.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.105
I don't know about this, Axl.

04:42.185 --> 04:43.595
Wha-- look, that's fine.

04:43.695 --> 04:44.423
Go ahead.

04:44.507 --> 04:45.610
Dress like one of
the characters in the book

04:45.685 --> 04:47.838
and do a lame presentation
like a million other kids.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.032
What do <i> you</i> want, Brick?

04:50.142 --> 04:51.478
Do you want to go
the safe route,

04:51.598 --> 04:54.028
or do you want to be
an innovator,

04:54.133 --> 04:57.720
a trailblazer, a rule breaker?!

04:58.175 --> 04:59.180
I do.

04:59.263 --> 05:01.723
Then give me "One fish,
two fish, red fish, blue fish"

05:01.811 --> 05:03.210
and let's change the world!

05:03.802 --> 05:04.893
Yeah!

05:06.767 --> 05:08.425
Surprise!

05:08.506 --> 05:09.794
I'm here to take you to prom!

05:09.989 --> 05:10.929
What?

05:11.014 --> 05:12.363
Yeah, my mom
was talking to your mom,

05:12.465 --> 05:14.302
and she was saying how no one
had asked you to prom yet

05:14.399 --> 05:15.987
and how crazy that was.

05:16.123 --> 05:17.938
So my mom said, "It might
be nice if you'd take her,"

05:18.030 --> 05:19.775
and I said, "Are you kidding me?

05:19.916 --> 05:23.073
I'd do anything for Susie Q!"
You're like family.

05:23.169 --> 05:25.227
Oh! Wow, Sean.

05:25.316 --> 05:27.593
That is so incredibly nice!

05:27.741 --> 05:29.743
Actually,
the funny thing is --

05:29.819 --> 05:31.549
Yeah, my car broke down twice

05:31.645 --> 05:33.129
on the way down here
from Notre Dame,

05:33.207 --> 05:33.957
but I got it fixed.

05:34.045 --> 05:36.033
And I had to ask a professor
to move a big test,

05:36.138 --> 05:37.400
and I'm missing
my fraternity photo,

05:37.481 --> 05:39.442
but I said, "I don't care.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.711
I'm takin' Sue to her prom."
So, here I am.

05:44.013 --> 05:44.984
Well, great!

05:45.103 --> 05:46.294
- Yay!
- Yeah!

05:46.542 --> 05:47.807
Fun!

05:54.161 --> 05:57.279
<i>So, Sue had gone from no
dates to the prom to two dates --</i>

05:57.375 --> 06:00.077
<i>a problem she never in her life</i>
<i>could have anticipated.</i>

06:00.195 --> 06:01.961
<i>But since Sean had gone</i>
<i>to all that effort,</i>

06:02.050 --> 06:03.752
<i>Sue knew she had to do</i>
<i>the right thing</i>

06:03.869 --> 06:05.539
<i>and kick Edwin to the curb.</i>

06:05.652 --> 06:07.204
Okay, what color
are you wearing?

06:07.360 --> 06:11.243
Uh, green and burnt tangerine.

06:11.366 --> 06:12.562
No, silly, for the prom.

06:12.668 --> 06:13.995
'Cause I want to get
a matching cummerbund.

06:14.140 --> 06:14.712
Uh --

06:14.789 --> 06:16.118
Oh, and I'm gonna wear
my dress shoes,

06:16.217 --> 06:18.747
but can I put my jazz shoes
in your purse for dancing later?

06:18.918 --> 06:20.527
Brad, what are you
talking about?

06:20.606 --> 06:22.735
Prom. We always said that
if neither of us had a date,

06:22.820 --> 06:23.847
we'd be each other's date.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.205
I'm so glad I have you.
Otherwise, I'd be devastated.

06:26.327 --> 06:27.495
So, we're going together,
right?

06:29.583 --> 06:31.024
You bet!

06:33.312 --> 06:34.186
Hey, did I tell you we got

06:34.285 --> 06:36.980
those new rotary saliva ejectors
at work?

06:37.205 --> 06:38.174
Hm.

06:38.891 --> 06:41.088
Still gettin' spit on
a lot, though.

06:44.954 --> 06:46.696
Got to get working
on those taxes.

06:46.986 --> 06:48.054
Yep.

06:48.215 --> 06:50.424
Comes faster every year.

06:50.703 --> 06:51.866
It does.

06:57.225 --> 06:58.549
They're not here, Frankie.

07:04.377 --> 07:06.207
I'm so confused.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.394
I mean,
Brad is an amazing friend

07:08.498 --> 07:11.314
and he has always been there
for me, and he'll do my makeup.

07:11.450 --> 07:13.883
But Sean drove all the way down
from Notre Dame

07:13.988 --> 07:15.457
just to take me.

07:15.596 --> 07:16.974
What do you think I should do?

07:19.229 --> 07:21.237
Oh. Ha ha.
Very funny, Axl.

07:21.344 --> 07:23.438
You know, this is
a very serious issue

07:23.517 --> 07:25.040
and a lot of people's feelings
are at stake

07:25.110 --> 07:26.894
and you are not being
very supportive!

07:27.484 --> 07:28.239
Aah!

07:31.113 --> 07:32.696
You. Me. Prom.

07:32.781 --> 07:34.780
Pick me up at 7:00.
Show some leg.

07:34.861 --> 07:36.331
Are you -- What --

07:36.427 --> 07:37.583
No, no, no, but I-I--

07:38.631 --> 07:39.771
Ha.

07:42.247 --> 07:43.657
Yeah. Right.

07:51.541 --> 07:52.632
You know what?

07:52.719 --> 07:53.540
Maybe we've just said

07:53.631 --> 07:55.239
everything we've had to say
to each other.

07:55.324 --> 07:57.344
You wanted to bring it,
I wanted to bring it.

07:57.479 --> 07:59.420
Maybe there's
just nothing to bring.

07:59.719 --> 08:01.292
This is why we should never
leave the couch.

08:01.384 --> 08:02.729
Let the cable company bring it.

08:02.831 --> 08:03.937
Yeah, that's fine for now.

08:04.064 --> 08:06.265
But when the kids leave,
it's just gonna be you and me,

08:06.361 --> 08:07.642
and we're not gonna have
anything to talk about.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.365
Then we're just gonna be two old
people staring at each other.

08:10.444 --> 08:11.386
We won't be alone.

08:11.473 --> 08:13.337
Brick will be here,
jumbling up our meds.

08:13.419 --> 08:15.128
I'm just saying,
if we want to have any prayer

08:15.219 --> 08:15.967
of an interesting life,

08:16.065 --> 08:18.385
we're gonna have to bring
other people into it.

08:18.652 --> 08:20.123
You know what we should do?

08:20.202 --> 08:21.428
I know it's not
your favorite thing,

08:21.516 --> 08:22.880
but I think we should have
a dinner party.

08:22.957 --> 08:24.462
You know, we used to have

08:24.550 --> 08:26.220
those Memorial Day barbecues
every year.

08:26.304 --> 08:28.767
We put the keg on the porch.
Remember?

08:28.898 --> 08:31.032
I mean, we used to be fun,
social people, Mike.

08:31.106 --> 08:32.703
I've seen the pictures.

08:32.881 --> 08:33.732
Hmm.

08:34.115 --> 08:35.508
I am pretty bored
of talking to you.

08:35.587 --> 08:38.548
Exactly, and I'm totally sick
of talking to you.

08:39.509 --> 08:41.306
Sure. What the hell?

08:41.399 --> 08:42.381
Let's do it.

08:44.679 --> 08:45.722
I love books.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.206
Do you remember
"Pat The Bunny"?

08:47.379 --> 08:48.654
You could feel the bunny.

08:49.066 --> 08:49.830
Oh.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.398
Hey, Darrin.

08:51.642 --> 08:52.624
Hey, Sue.

08:52.712 --> 08:54.404
- No-no-no-no-no! Bup-bup-bup!
- No, wait!

08:54.869 --> 08:55.756
No!!

08:56.005 --> 08:57.018
Oops.

08:57.698 --> 08:58.703
Sorry.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:07.018 --> 09:08.118
Hey, again.

09:08.222 --> 09:09.443
Oh, hey.

09:09.587 --> 09:12.240
So, this is where
the Heck laundry goes down, huh?

09:12.355 --> 09:15.286
Yep, this is where
the magic happens.

09:15.374 --> 09:16.184
I've seen the clean clothes,

09:16.271 --> 09:17.782
but you never get to see
behind the scenes.

09:17.877 --> 09:20.509
Very few
have had the privilege.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.560
So, listen, I was thinking,

09:25.007 --> 09:26.939
you know, sometimes
people don't always

09:27.022 --> 09:28.864
have dates to the prom.

09:29.882 --> 09:31.556
And I don't know
if you do or you don't,

09:32.094 --> 09:34.521
but if you don't and you want to
go, I'm around,

09:34.598 --> 09:36.283
so I could take you
if you want.

09:37.030 --> 09:39.160
Are you kidding me right now?!

09:39.303 --> 09:41.471
No, uh, but if you
don't want to --

09:41.550 --> 09:42.411
No. No, no, no,
no, no.

09:42.490 --> 09:43.236
I do, I do, I do.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.467
I definitely, definitely do.

09:45.754 --> 09:48.000
I just have to check
on a few things.

09:48.403 --> 09:50.646
But, yes.
Yes, my answer is yes.

10:02.256 --> 10:04.116
Hey! Sue!

10:04.239 --> 10:05.597
Excited for next Saturday?

10:05.677 --> 10:07.399
I was just getting ready
to pick up your corsage.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.664
Hope you like gardenias.

10:08.752 --> 10:10.444
Actually, Sean, about that...

10:11.114 --> 10:13.406
I really appreciate
you asking me.

10:13.531 --> 10:17.082
Like, you have no idea
how much that means to me.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.791
And I think it would be
really fun to go together,

10:20.218 --> 10:25.149
but somehow, I ended up
with four other dates to prom.

10:25.265 --> 10:29.288
So, unfortunately,
I won't be able to go with you.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.876
Oh. Wow.

10:31.984 --> 10:34.772
But it's not like I had four
other dates when you asked me.

10:34.898 --> 10:35.901
I had one.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.394
But of all the people
that I'm not going with,

10:38.501 --> 10:40.302
<i>you</i> are really my favorite.

10:40.395 --> 10:42.913
Okay! Yeah, no problem.
That's cool.

10:42.998 --> 10:43.777
I'll -- I'll just --

10:43.849 --> 10:45.186
I guess I'll just head on back
up to school.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.192
It's a six-hour drive,

10:46.273 --> 10:48.123
so I won't get back in time
for the fraternity photo.

10:48.213 --> 10:50.373
But, hey,
there's always next year.

10:51.715 --> 10:54.994
Thank you so much
for understanding, Sean.

10:55.278 --> 10:58.270
I am so, so sorry.

10:58.356 --> 11:00.165
Hey! No problem.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.154
What?!
Sue, you can't do this!

11:07.302 --> 11:09.484
You know I would never,
but it's Darrin.

11:09.574 --> 11:10.901
You know how I feel
about Darrin.

11:11.013 --> 11:12.059
Sue, you promised.

11:12.158 --> 11:13.474
Love affairs
with thick-necked,

11:13.555 --> 11:14.685
handsome blond men
will come and go,

11:14.754 --> 11:16.066
but best friendships
are forever.

11:16.146 --> 11:19.512
I know, and I wouldn't cancel
if it was <i> anybody</i> else.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.053
Well, if your girlfriend
from Canada

11:21.156 --> 11:24.450
would suddenly be able to go --
Arena or Ariel --

11:24.543 --> 11:25.881
It's Arena.
It's definitely Arena.

11:25.974 --> 11:26.924
That's a real name.

11:27.032 --> 11:28.598
Well, if she
was suddenly able to go,

11:28.693 --> 11:31.182
you know I would be okay
letting you go with her

11:31.293 --> 11:32.751
because that is
what is so great

11:32.847 --> 11:33.766
about our friendship --

11:33.906 --> 11:36.356
we always want the best
for each other.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.996
All right, fine.

11:39.076 --> 11:40.723
- Go with Darrin.
- Yes!

11:40.832 --> 11:41.694
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

11:44.215 --> 11:48.542
Hey, lady, my brother
said he can't take you to prom.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.806
He's in juvie.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.619
What? Why?
What'd he do?

11:51.776 --> 11:53.824
None of your damn business!

12:01.527 --> 12:02.692
Hey, Edwin.

12:02.897 --> 12:05.330
So, listen,
about prom --

12:05.444 --> 12:07.593
Oh, I know all about it.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.353
You didn't think
I'd hear about you and Brad,

12:09.484 --> 12:11.559
the great hot-dog
adventure guy?

12:11.712 --> 12:13.320
Uh, what?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.343
Yeah, it's all over
the food court.

12:15.462 --> 12:18.076
He's counter, I'm management.

12:18.187 --> 12:20.028
You had a good thing,
and you blew it.

12:20.119 --> 12:22.473
You don't think I could've
taken Kathy at Orange Julius?

12:22.566 --> 12:25.960
As soon as her lap-band kicks
in, she's gonna be gorgeous.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.415
Oh, I was gonna tell you

12:27.503 --> 12:28.965
what the featured potato is
for next month,

12:29.084 --> 12:31.141
but now you'll just have to
find out with everyone else.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.408
Ohh.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.633
Yeah!

12:39.514 --> 12:41.301
Hey, I didn't know
you were in town.

12:41.381 --> 12:44.199
Yeah, I was doing a favor
for my mom taking Sue to prom.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.200
I was happy to do it,

12:45.275 --> 12:47.710
but it turns out
she's got like four other dates.

12:47.814 --> 12:49.096
Wait. Are you sure?
'Cause --

12:49.211 --> 12:50.964
Yeah,
that's what she said --

12:51.121 --> 12:52.610
four guys.

12:53.029 --> 12:55.457
But I'm fine. It's --
it's fine. I'm fine.

12:55.530 --> 12:58.784
I'll just smile through it just --
just like I smile through everything.

13:04.883 --> 13:06.530
<i>Hey, Sue, it's Darrin.</i>

13:06.620 --> 13:08.110
<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>
<i>about prom.</i>

13:08.235 --> 13:10.617
<i>When I asked you, I didn't</i>
<i>realize you had so many dates.</i>

13:10.777 --> 13:11.768
<i>I was just trying to be nice,</i>

13:11.906 --> 13:12.982
<i>but you can take me off</i>
<i>the list</i>

13:13.062 --> 13:14.885
<i>because, clearly,</i>
<i>you've got a lot going on.</i>

13:14.992 --> 13:17.366
<i>And the truth is, I didn't</i>
<i>really want to go anyway.</i>

13:17.460 --> 13:19.450
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I don't care about prom.</i>

13:19.651 --> 13:20.680
<i>I've been before.</i>

13:20.795 --> 13:22.411
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>I was just being nice.</i>

13:23.427 --> 13:24.788
<i>This is Darrin.</i>

13:38.188 --> 13:40.042
So, who's the unlucky guy

13:40.111 --> 13:41.802
you decided to go to prom with?

13:41.918 --> 13:43.408
Actually, nobody.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.446
I am taking myself to prom.

13:45.682 --> 13:48.249
Just like Molly Ringwald
in "Pretty In Pink."

13:48.991 --> 13:52.063
It's a very important movie from
the '80s about self-acceptance.

13:52.604 --> 13:54.379
Wait, I thought
you were going with Darrin.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.901
I was,
but then I guess he decided

13:58.011 --> 14:00.509
he didn't want to go to prom
after all.

14:00.761 --> 14:02.203
Oh, well.

14:02.576 --> 14:03.709
I'm off to prom.

14:04.022 --> 14:05.049
Will you take my picture?

14:16.204 --> 14:17.276
Thanks.

14:22.410 --> 14:24.475
I know I'm only 12,
but that was the saddest thing

14:24.559 --> 14:26.376
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

14:26.475 --> 14:28.003
Yeah.

14:29.257 --> 14:30.956
Ooph. Bl-bl!

14:31.056 --> 14:32.907
Dah, all right, agh!

14:33.072 --> 14:34.619
We got to get this done before
mom's dumb dinner party.

14:34.704 --> 14:35.704
- Mm.
- You ready?

14:35.790 --> 14:38.075
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this!

14:40.227 --> 14:42.314
Okay.

14:44.376 --> 14:45.395
Yes!

14:47.325 --> 14:48.560
Yes! Yes!

14:48.663 --> 14:49.977
Ah!

14:50.062 --> 14:52.155
Brilliant!
Oh, I'm a genius!

14:54.636 --> 14:55.525
Yes!

14:55.794 --> 14:57.105
Yes!

14:57.260 --> 14:58.522
Oh, my God!

14:59.601 --> 15:01.156
Yes! Yes!

15:02.273 --> 15:03.503
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!

15:03.618 --> 15:04.752
Oh, my God!
I'm a genius!

15:07.673 --> 15:09.966
"He was an old man
who fished alone in a skiff."

15:10.148 --> 15:11.951
You hooked?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.471
And cut!

15:13.601 --> 15:15.201
Oh, yes, we did it!

15:15.291 --> 15:16.057
Yes!

15:16.136 --> 15:18.192
- Whoo!
- Oh, thank you!

15:18.474 --> 15:20.098
You know, I've never
been there. I hear it's nice.

15:20.192 --> 15:21.848
Oh, no, I hate Santa Fe.

15:21.982 --> 15:23.237
- What?
- Yeah, all that adobe.

15:23.347 --> 15:25.093
You know, it's, like,
a whole city made of mud.

15:25.181 --> 15:28.090
Oh, don't listen to him.
He doesn't hate Santa Fe.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.522
How do you hate a whole city?

15:29.641 --> 15:30.520
Well...

15:30.657 --> 15:33.024
True story --
I suggested to Bill

15:33.121 --> 15:34.660
that we vacation
in new Mexico once,

15:34.755 --> 15:37.318
and he said no 'cause he didn't
want to leave the country.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.008
Hey, you -- you want a smart guy
or you a sexy guy?

15:42.087 --> 15:43.981
'Cause, uh, I might be able
to introduce you to somebody.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.000
- Oh, Frankie, everything looks delicious!
- Yes.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.713
- Thank you.
- Mangia! Mangia!

15:50.800 --> 15:51.957
We went to Italy last summer,

15:52.068 --> 15:53.428
and the only two things
he learned to say

15:53.508 --> 15:55.685
were "Let's eat"
and "We can't afford that."

15:56.922 --> 15:58.401
We went to Italy
last summer, too!

15:58.475 --> 15:59.033
Really?

15:59.108 --> 16:01.757
- Yeah, we went on a cruise
for our anniversary. - We did.

16:01.830 --> 16:02.835
Oh, yeah?
Where'd you guys go?

16:02.927 --> 16:04.830
Oh, well, we went
to the whole Tuscany thing.

16:04.919 --> 16:06.366
Oh, where?

16:11.915 --> 16:14.011
- What does?
- Like tongue-twisters.

16:14.791 --> 16:15.980
And sometimes you can get into
these mud --

16:16.075 --> 16:16.813
it's like a mud bath.

16:16.889 --> 16:19.432
It's like a -- it's like mask
for your whole body.

16:19.527 --> 16:21.681
So, what did you do today?

16:23.249 --> 16:26.859
♪ hey, you ♪

16:26.972 --> 16:30.163
♪ shine like a star,
'cause you know that you are ♪

16:30.239 --> 16:31.415
Hey, Sue.

16:31.506 --> 16:32.506
Are you here alone?

16:32.798 --> 16:33.986
Yeah.

16:34.165 --> 16:35.178
Me, too.

16:37.601 --> 16:39.956
<i>Yep, it wouldn't be prom</i>
<i>if some poor Heck</i>

16:40.046 --> 16:42.643
<i>didn't end up going</i>
<i>with Weird Ashley.</i>

16:49.073 --> 16:52.372
Okay, I downloaded the video
onto the laptop.

16:52.459 --> 16:53.827
Are you ready for greatness?!

16:53.901 --> 16:55.453
- Lay it on me.
- All right!

16:56.370 --> 16:57.687
<i>Let's do this!</i>

16:58.743 --> 16:59.789
<i>Oh, there it goes!</i>

16:59.881 --> 17:00.872
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>It's working!</i>

17:00.961 --> 17:02.929
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I'm a genius!</i>

17:04.148 --> 17:06.973
<i>Brick, oh! You're so lucky</i>
<i>you got me for a brother!</i>

17:07.070 --> 17:10.310
<i>"He was an old man who</i>
<i>fished alone in a skiff."</i>

17:10.391 --> 17:11.172
<i>You hooked?</i>

17:11.208 --> 17:13.723
<i>And cut!</i>

17:14.709 --> 17:18.146
Aah, grades don't really matter
till high school anyway.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.213
What are you doing?

17:24.465 --> 17:25.550
Nothing. Just
getting some coffee.

17:25.632 --> 17:26.726
What are you doing in here?

17:26.856 --> 17:29.032
I don't know. Came to see
what you were doing.

17:29.204 --> 17:32.084
Hmm. Well, I suppose one of us
should be in there.

17:32.162 --> 17:33.881
Why? We're just
talking to each other.

17:33.964 --> 17:34.769
I think we've established

17:34.859 --> 17:36.292
we don't have anything
to say to each other.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.494
Besides, they won't
even know we're gone.

17:41.243 --> 17:45.099
Well, should we go back there
and try to get in the mix?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.433
Seems like a lot of work.

17:47.515 --> 17:48.513
Let's just take our foot
off the pedal

17:48.602 --> 17:50.946
and coast to the grave.

17:51.051 --> 17:53.478
- Impossible!
- Do you hear that?

17:53.558 --> 17:54.546
Why did you say
that you hated Santa Fe?

17:54.633 --> 17:56.211
How do you know those people
are not from Santa Fe?!

17:56.301 --> 17:57.721
So what if they are?
Okay?

17:57.799 --> 17:59.698
Why are you always so worried
about what people think?

17:59.771 --> 18:02.301
You say something and you don't think
and then you embarrass everyone!

18:02.374 --> 18:03.945
Oh, yeah, you're worried
about being embarrassed.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.935
Do you realize how loud
your laugh is?

18:06.058 --> 18:08.434
You can't even hear other people
'cause your laugh is so loud.

18:08.519 --> 18:10.555
- Oh, great, so now you're gonna
tell me how to laugh? - Yeah.

18:10.644 --> 18:11.731
I don't tell you
how to eat --

18:11.828 --> 18:13.839
the way your teeth click
together when you chew!

18:13.923 --> 18:16.853
<i>Sometimes, all it takes</i>
<i>to feel better about yourselves</i>

18:16.937 --> 18:19.106
<i>is seeing somebody</i>
<i>who's got it worse.</i>

18:19.509 --> 18:22.177
<i>Maybe behind closed doors,</i>
<i>nobody's really bringing it.</i>

18:22.909 --> 18:25.892
<i>And as a bonus, it gave us</i>
<i>plenty to talk about.</i>

18:26.568 --> 18:28.398
Can you believe he talked
to her like that?

18:28.502 --> 18:30.141
- Ohh.
- I had no idea.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.817
You look at their house,
and it's all perfect,

18:32.912 --> 18:34.288
but you don't know.

18:34.389 --> 18:36.115
You never know.

18:36.257 --> 18:38.935
I mean, it makes sense 'cause
you know how controlling she is,

18:39.021 --> 18:40.712
so of course she is with him.

18:40.805 --> 18:42.247
And he's out of town
all the time.

18:42.416 --> 18:46.146
- You got to wonder.
- You really do.

18:46.235 --> 18:47.929
Did you hear what she said
to him when they were leaving?

18:48.103 --> 18:49.772
Don't tell me yet. Save it.

18:49.842 --> 18:51.686
We'll take a walk tomorrow.
You can tell me about it then.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.548
Hey, am I too
late for the big book tipping?

18:56.643 --> 18:57.692
Did I miss it?

18:57.778 --> 18:58.926
Yeah, you missed it.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.352
Whatever, Darrin.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.312
Hey. What's with you?

19:02.529 --> 19:03.545
What's with <i> me?</i>

19:03.670 --> 19:05.034
I don't want to see
your stupid face right now.

19:05.113 --> 19:06.317
That's what's with <i> me.</i>

19:06.423 --> 19:08.858
That's not very nice to say that
about somebody's face.

19:08.954 --> 19:10.159
What did my face
ever do to you?

19:10.240 --> 19:12.135
You told my sister you were
gonna take her to prom,

19:12.222 --> 19:14.846
and then, like, you just
cancel on her last minute?

19:14.992 --> 19:16.575
What are you talking about?

19:16.659 --> 19:18.048
She has like a million dates.

19:18.128 --> 19:19.409
No, she doesn't, Darrin.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.928
She went to prom alone,
and she wanted to go with you,

19:22.019 --> 19:23.899
so nice goin'.

19:24.261 --> 19:26.073
She doesn't even like me.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.874
Oh, my God.
Are you an idiot?

19:28.142 --> 19:30.704
Do you not see how she gets
those weird, googly eyes

19:30.811 --> 19:32.867
whenever you come over
and grins like an idiot?

19:33.033 --> 19:35.028
It's completely disgusting
and makes me want to vomit.

19:35.111 --> 19:37.918
But for whatever reason,
she still really likes you,

19:38.052 --> 19:39.992
and you really hurt her,
and that's not cool.

19:40.092 --> 19:41.377
You do not hurt my sister.

19:42.827 --> 19:44.046
I had no idea.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.072
And here's another slow song,

19:57.165 --> 19:59.765
so hold on tight
to the one you love.

20:02.183 --> 20:03.456
You know what, Ashley?

20:03.575 --> 20:05.069
Uh, I'm kind of tired,

20:05.155 --> 20:07.867
and I'm really not
having that much fun.

20:07.970 --> 20:10.062
It's not you.
It's me.

20:10.282 --> 20:12.267
I think
I'm just gonna head home.

Hi.

20:45.247 --> 20:46.564
What are you doing here?

20:46.701 --> 20:48.497
I came to take you to prom.

20:49.137 --> 20:50.941
But I --
I got your message.

20:51.029 --> 20:52.912
I thought you didn't care
about prom.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.829
I don't.
I only care about you.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.680
I know it didn't work out
last time

20:57.770 --> 20:58.700
and you told me to forget you,

20:58.781 --> 21:00.459
but the thing is, Sue, I can't.

21:00.551 --> 21:01.904
I think about you all the time.

21:02.007 --> 21:03.068
And I get up, and I think,

21:03.156 --> 21:04.853
"Okay, I will not
think about Sue today."

21:04.970 --> 21:07.479
But then it backfires, 'cause I'm
thinking about you even more, and...
