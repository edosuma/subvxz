02:45.748 --> 02:48.543
{\an5}And we were trying
to go out there and have
a real ass conversation.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.087
And this lady came
from left field.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.964
And just started
going nuts.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.424

go get her address?

{\an5}Let's go beat them up.

to make sure

02:57.343 --> 02:59.596
Because I like to cake--
take care of myself.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.222
People wanna dog me
for that, you know?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.849
{\an5}And I'm, like...

03:01.306 --> 03:02.849
What does
it matter, though?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.184
As far as-- I get people
dogging on my appearance

03:05.268 --> 03:06.769
{\an5}all the time.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.769

I have to say real quick.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.776
Look at me.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.904
Why do you let
that get to you?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.323
Based off of your appearance,
what does it matter?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.617
{\an1}Does it matter
whether people think?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.160
Does it really?

03:22.243 --> 03:25.622
There's literally
good vibes everywhere.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.248
And then for some reason,

03:27.332 --> 03:28.958
Jeremiah's sitting
there giving lectures.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.377
He's, like, well, I love myself.
You should just love yourself.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.213
It's easier said
than done, Jeremiah.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.966
Because in the end, the only
person that should be satisfied

03:37.050 --> 03:39.928
with yourself <i> is yourself.</i>

Jeremiah,

03:41.471 --> 03:43.806

socially challenged.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.391
I want to be okay
with myself.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.644
And why do you think
I get everything I do

03:47.727 --> 03:49.520
to myself because I don't.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.897
Right now,
Nilsa is not in a place

03:50.980 --> 03:52.607
where she can leave
her past in the past.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.276
All I can do is just explain
my side of it to her

03:55.360 --> 03:56.861
and hope she understands.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.529
{\an1}Like , there was a, a big point
in my life where I was, like,

03:58.613 --> 04:01.074
{\an1}you know what, I am pretty,
I am beautiful.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.951
And then when I got out
of the relationship,

04:03.034 --> 04:03.910
I'm, like, I'm nothing.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.912
I'm 15 pounds overweight
and here I am.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.289
I don't feel like I'm good
enough, like...

04:08.373 --> 04:09.999
I sit here
and cake on makeup all day

04:10.083 --> 04:11.834
so I can feel pretty
about myself.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.628
And then when I feel pretty,

04:13.711 --> 04:15.672
people make me feel bad
for being pretty.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.632

{\an3}Yes.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.259

if you fat, you tall,

04:23.930 --> 04:25.181

just what it is.

04:26.808 --> 04:31.854
{\an8}I think Nilsa is realizing that
she has issues to deal with.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.066
So, our biggest hope is that we
can come together and help her.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.526

You be who you are.

04:36.609 --> 04:40.822

ass shirt come up to you

04:40.905 --> 04:43.408

you put him in his place.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.243

Yeah, he said, psyche.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.758
{\an4}(Kirk)
I don't know, dude,
I was pissed off.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.177
(crosstalk)

07:08.261 --> 07:09.804
{\an5}(Kirk)
Jeremiah's my dog.
Love him to death.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.097
{\an8}But I feel like he would not
take a bullet for me.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.516
{\an8}That's just who he is,
and I know that as a person.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.226
{\an8}I just keep that
in the back of my head.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.686
I just wish they would
understand where I'm coming from

07:16.769 --> 07:20.231
that no matter what, you have
your family and friends back.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.608
I'll take a bullet for you if it
really does come down to it.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.360
How I am here, like,
trying to squash (bleep).

07:24.443 --> 07:26.028
That's how I am back home
with my boys.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.196
{\an1}But it's, like, that's with any
family, brothers, sisters...

07:27.280 --> 07:30.032
{\an6}Yeah.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.032
Cousins.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.951
{\an1}Random roommates
you got for the summer, like,

07:32.034 --> 07:33.119
{\an5}it's gonna be...

07:32.034 --> 07:33.119
{\an3}(laughing)

07:33.202 --> 07:34.120
{\an5}Different places (bleep).

07:33.202 --> 07:34.120
Exactly.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.746
Dude, last night
was a (bleep).

07:35.830 --> 07:37.790
{\an1}It did kind of bring us, like,
closer in a way, you know?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.167
Found out everybody's
got each other's back.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.043
{\an1}Regardless of what we're
fighting about or whatever,

07:41.127 --> 07:42.211
{\an5}we got each other.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.211
{\an3}Yeah.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.880
{\an5}It could've been worse.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.880
(bleep) happens.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.173
{\an5}(Kirk)
Me and Gus are the tightest
in this house

07:45.256 --> 07:46.215
when it comes
to the dudes.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.884
We both have similar, like,

07:47.967 --> 07:50.553
struggles being on our own
at a younger age

07:50.636 --> 07:51.637
and, like, you know,

07:51.721 --> 07:53.097
living out of our cars
at points.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.016
And I grew
tougher skin from it.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.642
Love the guy, he's--
that's my boy,

07:56.726 --> 07:57.310
that's my homie "quo fo."

07:57.393 --> 08:00.146
Donovan's again tonight?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.481
(laughing)

08:03.482 --> 08:07.111
(Kortni)
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

08:07.195 --> 08:08.863
{\an1}We're going to my house
if that's okay with everybody.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.574
{\an4}(Gus)
That's fine.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.574
{\an1}(Kirk)
Yeah, I'm down.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.659
{\an6}Okay.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.659
Yes!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.244
{\an5}You're--
If you whack me...

08:13.743 --> 08:15.244
{\an1}Yes!

08:15.328 --> 08:17.997
{\an5}I will break your (bleep).

08:15.328 --> 08:17.997
Neh! Neh! Neh! Neh!

08:18.080 --> 08:20.750
My expectations for meeting,
uh, Kortni's mom.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.918
I bet she's
crazy as hell.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.921
But we'll see
because Kortni's a wild card

08:25.004 --> 08:26.255
at this point. (chuckling)

08:26.339 --> 08:28.841
All right, y'all,
I gotta take, like, ten shots.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.926
Because I'm not spending
money tonight.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.136
♪♪

08:33.221 --> 08:34.013
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Are we going out tonight?

08:34.096 --> 08:35.597
(Codi)
That Cajun place.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.308
Okay.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.311
{\an5}(sing-song)
Wha, wha, wha, wha,
wha-wha-wha-wha.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.772
(line ringing)

08:42.855 --> 08:44.232
{\an8}(Kayla Jo)
<i>Hello?</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:45.358
{\an8}I just wanted to let you know
what the game plan was.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.902
{\an8}We're going to some
Cajun restaurant, so...

08:47.985 --> 08:50.696
<i>All right, I'll, I'll try</i>
<i>to be there at 11:30.</i>

08:50.780 --> 08:53.032
Having Kayla Jo around
is fun for me

08:53.115 --> 08:55.576
because she gives me
a level of sanity.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.287
Y'all (bleep) go!

08:58.371 --> 08:59.789
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
She's a little older,
but it's nice to have

08:59.872 --> 09:02.458
a mature woman in your bed
if you know what I mean.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.126
All right, sounds like a plan.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.295
{\an6}<i>Bye-bye.</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:06.295
Bye, Kayla.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.341
Game time, fellas.

09:10.424 --> 09:14.136
At the Cajun Cafe.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.638
{\an1}(Codi)
Time to eat.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.142
{\an5}(Candace)
Do y'all mind saying
a quick prayer?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.478
(Codi)
Yeah, let's say it.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.146
Our Father in heaven,
thank you for this food.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.649
Thank you for, um, bringing us
altogether today.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.150
Thank you for us
having a successful day.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.319
No fights, no arguments.
That we have a great night.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.071
Watch over
our families, amen.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.155
(all)
Amen.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.032
{\an1}We really haven't
fought all day.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.201
(Codi)
We have not.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.245
{\an4}Holy moly.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.245
{\an1}I think we're really starting
to come together now.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.206
{\an5}We had to get
all that (bleep) out.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.206
It took that crazy lady...

09:42.290 --> 09:43.541
God bless her.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.625
(laughter)

09:44.709 --> 09:46.043
I look at my roommates
differently now.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.963
It makes me feel like we're
all down for each other.

09:49.046 --> 09:53.884
And that we actually
might all like each other.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.219
Excuse me,
this is a little Jameson.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.430
{\an3}Oh (bleep).

09:57.513 --> 10:00.308
Oh, well, yes, sir,
God bless you.

10:00.391 --> 10:03.185
{\an7}(man)
Yes, I do.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.521
Okay, a ranger's home
is the forest.

10:05.604 --> 10:08.649
A sailor's home
is the sea.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.486
A whiskey glass and a hooker's
ass is home sweet home to me.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.406
(cheering)

10:15.489 --> 10:17.199
(Codi)
I could drink to that.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.535
{\an5}(Nilsa)
It feels great to finally get
to have, like, this night out

10:19.618 --> 10:21.579
as a group where we're not
acting wild and crazy.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.205
All right, guys,
let's get it.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.124
{\an4}Thank you!

10:23.289 --> 10:25.124
All right, thank you
guys so much!

10:25.207 --> 10:26.375
We can go back
in the house

10:26.459 --> 10:28.294
and there not be any
tensions or egg shells.

10:28.377 --> 10:31.714
{\an5}(Kirk)
You look like you're going to
an Atlanta bar right now, dog.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.591
Hey, that's a outfit if you
walk the Buckhead with me.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.592
You pullin'
all the (bleep).

10:34.675 --> 10:36.177
{\an5}All the (bleep)?

10:34.675 --> 10:36.177
All the (bleep).

10:36.260 --> 10:37.803
{\an5}I'll have to keep
that in mind.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.803
What about my outfit?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
Can I pull hella (bleep)?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.389
In Atlanta, yes.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.224
Uh, yeah, you could pull,
like, some Black chicks.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.435
But they gonna be, like,
the fat Black chicks, though.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.436
{\an1}(Codi)
That's okay.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.355
(Kayla Jo)
Hello!

10:47.438 --> 10:48.898
{\an5}Hey, Kayla Jo.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.898
Kayla Jo, what's up?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.733
{\an1}What's up, Miss lady?
(chuckling)

10:50.816 --> 10:51.942
{\an6}Hi, guys.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.942
How you doing?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.527
Sorry, I smell
like pickle juice.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.695
(Nilsa)
Are you kidding me?

10:54.779 --> 10:57.114
Everyone's finally
getting along.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.741
When all of a sudden,
here comes Kayla Jo.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.950
The barnacle has arrived.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.702
It's, like,
she won't go away.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.455
Ew, so nice.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.873
Aimee, ask Kayla Jo
where her rent money is.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.460
If we're gonna act
like a hotel for her,

11:09.543 --> 11:10.795
we better start
collecting for it.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.881
Kayla Jo, honey, sorry,
but you're not gonna be

11:13.964 --> 11:17.426
one of my new roommates
no matter how hard you try.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.428
(moans)

11:19.512 --> 11:20.805
(man)
Coming up...

11:20.888 --> 11:22.890
{\an8}If you stay with us, you're
gonna have to pay rent now

11:22.973 --> 11:24.683
{\an8}'cause, uh,
it ain't cheap living here.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.519
{\an8}Here we go again.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.813
{\an8}(Kayla Jo)
You couldn't pay me
to live here.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.356
{\an7}You're right,
I probably couldn't.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.857
{\an8}Apparently,
she's a Wiccan.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.693
{\an8}The practicing of witchcraft.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.693
{\an8}Oh! No! No!

11:34.777 --> 11:37.113
{\an8}Unh-unh! Where's
that Jesus candle?!

11:37.196 --> 11:39.448
{\an8}Why do you talk
to women like this?!

11:39.532 --> 11:40.491
{\an8}Were you raised like that?!

11:40.574 --> 11:42.118
{\an8}My brother was not
raised like that.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.995
{\an8}Last I checked,
you earn respect, honey.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.751
{\an4}(Codi)
Oh, my God.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.751
(Aimee)
I am drunk.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.756
{\an8}My plan tonight is to really
try to give Kayla Jo a chance.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.342
{\an8}Um, I'm gonna kill her
with kindness.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.803
Oh, you! Hey!

12:00.886 --> 12:03.305
Well...

12:03.389 --> 12:04.473
what's up, Kayla Jo?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.267
Gotta work in the morning.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.977
{\an1}Damn! Well,
if you stay with us,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.145
{\an1}you're gonna have
to pay rent now

12:09.228 --> 12:10.729
{\an1}'cause, uh, it ain't
cheap living here.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.314
{\an1}(chuckles)

12:12.398 --> 12:14.650
{\an8}Here we go again.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.652
{\an5}(Kayla Jo)
You couldn't pay me
to live here.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.654
{\an3}(laughing)

12:18.737 --> 12:21.031
{\an1}I feel that, you're right.
I probably couldn't.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.658
(laughing)

12:22.741 --> 12:24.326
(Nilsa)
I tried to be nice.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.370
But a woman's intuition
is usually right.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.831
And mine about Kayla Jo
is that she just

12:28.914 --> 12:32.251
doesn't have good intentions.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.335
(bleep)

12:33.419 --> 12:36.380
(laughter)

12:36.464 --> 12:39.091
{\an1}That's the second time
a drink has spilled on me.

12:39.175 --> 12:39.633
Don't act like
you don't like it.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.469
(bleep) you.

12:41.552 --> 12:41.886
{\an1}(Gus)
You know you like it.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.476
{\an8}I honestly just wanna
go outside right now.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.810
{\an8}Spend a little alone
time with Kayla Jo

12:49.894 --> 12:53.314
{\an8}away from
any potential drama.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.318
God, she's a bitch.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.237
{\an4}(Kayla Jo)
My thing is if you can't say
nothing nice, don't speak.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.281
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
Yeah.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.450
{\an1}Although she'd
be silent, 24/7.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.785
{\an5}'Cause I've never heard
her say anything nice.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.785
Yeah.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.162
(Kayla Jo laughs)

13:08.245 --> 13:09.205
She would be.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.539
(both laughing)

13:10.623 --> 13:14.043
They're just children...

13:14.126 --> 13:15.252
{\an3}literally.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.004
(Aimee)
Save me a piece of pizza.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.132
{\an1}Would you guys
like some pizza?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.009
{\an1}Um, a slice
would be great, please.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.804
{\an4}Thank you.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.804
And if y'all need
more drinks, let me know.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.475
{\an1}Drinks, snacks,
a condom, let me know!

13:29.558 --> 13:31.894
Kayla Jo is a definition
of a barnacle.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.772
She's just clingy,
and no one likes clingy.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.023
So, that's definitely
not gonna fly.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.318
{\an4}(Nilsa)
Aimee, Aimee, Aimee,
your cigarette smells good.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.613
{\an5}You're killing me.
I'm about to have
a cigarette myself.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.574
No, don't start!
It causes wrinkles.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.576
I could, I could smoke
cigarettes every day

13:47.660 --> 13:48.702
of my life, and I could
quit like that because

13:48.786 --> 13:50.454
I don't have
an addictive personality.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
Smoking causes wrinkles.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.958
I don't
have wrinkles.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.918
All my family...

13:56.001 --> 13:57.336
Like, my mom's side,

13:57.419 --> 13:59.171
beautiful Hispanic women,
none of 'em have wrinkles.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.590
{\an5}And a bunch of them smoke.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.590
That hurt my feelings.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.342
{\an5}I don't have--

14:01.674 --> 14:03.342
So, it just comes
down to genetics.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.469
{\an5}Like, if you, like, my dad's
side, they're all white.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.469
I don't have wrinkles.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.097
{\an5}No, that hurt
my feelings, Kayla Jo.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.097
They're white people
and they all have wrinkles.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.307
You should quit smoking,
you're too beautiful.

{\an5}(Aimee)
Kayla Jo, Kathy Ho,
whatever her name is,

14:11.892 --> 14:15.312
she was talking
about me smoking.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.524
{\an8}She's very, like, sneaky,
disrespectful.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.942
{\an5}(Kayla Jo)
Like, have you ever
seen old women

14:20.025 --> 14:21.318
that they have wrinkles
around their lips?

14:21.402 --> 14:24.822
{\an1}You're beautiful, you will not
have wrinkles, don't even worry.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.949
You're not-- don't worry.
You're not gonna have wrinkles.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.367
Don't li--
You're not gonna have wrinkles.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.495
{\an8}But you will
if you keep smoking.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.541
Bitch, maybe you need to smoke
to chill your ass out.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.587
That girl is so dumb.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.963
Are you the youngest
in this house?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.798
Me and Gus are.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.134
And y'all seem to
be the most mature.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.845
Um, Kayla Jo?

14:47.928 --> 14:50.222
There's a taxi
outside for you.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.934
{\an5}All right.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.934
Where's our umbrella at?

14:54.018 --> 14:56.270
Hurry up and cut
this pizza, woman.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.938
The taxi's
gonna leave her.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.440
{\an1}Would you like
a juice or anything?

14:59.523 --> 15:01.734
No, you cooked,
this is great, thank you.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.235
I'll eat it
in the taxi.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.613
{\an6}Thank you.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.613
{\an1}And I got the umbrella

we'll see you.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.709
{\an1}I really don't
want this, so...

15:18.792 --> 15:20.753
Mixed meat's
not for me.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.213
{\an4}So, like, toss it on the way
in so she doesn't see it.

a big difference

You gotta be (bleep) me.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.207
The worst thing someone can do
to me is to take a piece

15:58.290 --> 16:01.710
of my pizza and just throw it
away like it means nothing.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.837

this is her pizza.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.054
{\an1}She left it right there
by my shoes.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.639
{\an1}She said she
wanted a piece.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.516
Well, she took
a bite, didn't she?

16:15.599 --> 16:18.102
She can't take it
in the taxi with her.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.854
Jeremiah, he's kind of like
making excuses for her.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.525
Tip-toeing around the fact that
she didn't just disrespect me.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.402
She disrespected my pizza.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.988
{\an4}Don't waste it, don't waste it,
don't waste it.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.988
Dude, I'll eat it, all right?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.116
I'll eat it and then
when she comes back,

16:32.199 --> 16:34.618
we'll make another slice
for God sake.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.788
{\an1}Thank you, I just didn't
want her to go home hungry.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.708
(Kirk)
Oh, my gosh.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.421
Every single day of my childhood
put into a freaking scrapbook.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.716
And everyone's seeing me
straight out the womb.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.384
My first boyfriend.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.720
First birthday,
second birthday.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.971
Every single birthday.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.597
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.018
Embarrassing.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.812
Here's the one of me actually
teaching you to potty train.

21:53.895 --> 21:58.317
I understand that she doesn't
always, um, go on the potty.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.653
{\an1}I promise I trained her
to not do that.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.155
(laughter)

22:03.238 --> 22:05.240
{\an5}(Candace)
I see the photo album
and I am so surprised.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.409
Kortni actually
was potty trained.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.745
Hey, why don't
y'all come in.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.871
{\an5}It's getting a little...

22:09.828 --> 22:10.871
{\an1}(Kortni)
Hey, yeah, let's go inside.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.956
{\an3}Yes, ma'am.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.916
{\an1}Do y'all wanna go ahead
and make a burger?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.043
(Nilsa)
You wanna sit down?

22:16.126 --> 22:17.544
(Kortni's mom)
No, I'm good.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.964
{\an1}Miss Sharon, you are so calm.
And then you have Kortni.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.258
{\an1}She tells everybody she
got her mom's party side.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.926
I said, "Kortni, have you
ever seen my party?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.136
I don't even drink."

22:26.219 --> 22:27.637
(laughing)

22:27.721 --> 22:30.223
I am really excited
that she has met

22:30.307 --> 22:32.100
wonderful people
like you all.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.436
I'm so exited
about that, um...

22:34.519 --> 22:36.730
Kortni's never paid
a bill or anything.

22:36.813 --> 22:39.608
{\an5}My phone bill.

22:36.813 --> 22:39.608
{\an1}She paid for her phone bill
when she turned 21.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.069
And she did have
to buy her car out there.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.570
{\an1}Y'all, I can't
tell y'all how, like,

22:43.653 --> 22:45.947
{\an1}hard I worked to pay
for that car.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.074
{\an1}Like, that
is the hardest thing

22:47.157 --> 22:48.492
{\an1}I've ever done
in my entire life.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.662
It's really heartwarming that
Kortni's mom is so proud of her.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.955
Because Kortni
is a great girl.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.291
And we're seeing Kortni
in a different light

22:56.375 --> 22:58.502
than we have seen.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.003
{\an5}(Sharon)
So, y'all tell me some
interesting facts

23:00.087 --> 23:01.004
about yourselves.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.715
I'm Aimee,
and I'm from Perdido.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.218
{\an1}And so you have how many
people in your town?

23:06.301 --> 23:08.095
Really about 45, 50.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.638
That's really little.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.308
{\an1}We have an elementary school
and a middle school.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.392
But not a high school.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.144
So, what do the high
school students do?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.980
They go 35 minutes away.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.149
{\an1}So, you drove 35 minutes
to school every day?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.859
No, I dropped out.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.237
You dropped out?

23:25.320 --> 23:26.154
{\an1}I've been on my own
since I was 17.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.906
{\an1}I got kicked out
of my house at 17.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.241
{\an1}I tried to go
into the military.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.033
{\an1}But unfortunately,
I broke my arm.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.743
So, I got disqualified.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.162
{\an1}I've been still grinding,
doing everything I can.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.123
{\an1}And just trying to stay
in school in the process.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.541
{\an1}I'll be at Florida State
in the fall.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.542
That's awesome.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.168
{\an1}Mm-hmm,
I'm excited for it.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.505
I'm so glad to have y'all here
because I want her to grow up.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.341
{\an1}And I think living in a house
with other young adults

23:46.424 --> 23:48.844
that, um, y'all can help her
grow in the right direction.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.846
Hold down a job because
I don't know if you know,

23:50.929 --> 23:54.683
{\an1}but she's been fired
from every job she's ever had.

23:54.766 --> 23:55.559
{\an5}(laughter)

23:54.766 --> 23:55.559
{\an1}(Gus)
We know.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.519
(Nilsa)
Well, she's doing good.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.104
I think by the end
of the summer,

23:59.187 --> 24:01.690
Kortni will have accomplished
what she came here to do.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.024
Which is grow up.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.235
All right, y'all,
thank y'all for coming.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.069
{\an1}Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.779
Oh, you're welcome.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.239
{\an5}(Kortni)
Hey, can someone
grab this beer?

24:09.322 --> 24:10.574
(crosstalk)

24:10.657 --> 24:12.993
{\an5}(Gus)
Well, thank you, Mom.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.993
You're welcome.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.329
{\an4}Thank you for having us here.
We appreciate it.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.329
Thank you so much.

24:16.413 --> 24:17.998
{\an1}You get
Mother of the Year.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.709
{\an1}Thank you for taking care
of her and being her friend.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.043
{\an5}Of course.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.043
She loves you.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.545
{\an5}Of course.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.545
She does.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.882
Kortni's mom is one of the
nicest people I have ever met.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.426
I mean, maybe it's not
her upbringing.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.262
Maybe she's always
just been crazy on her own.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.388
Her mama didn't make
no mistakes.

24:33.471 --> 24:36.600
{\an5}Bye!

24:33.471 --> 24:36.600
(Codi)
Bye, Ma.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.726
Y'all have fun.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.352
(Candace)
She's an angel, ain't she?

24:39.436 --> 24:42.147
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Yeah. The apple fell
really far from the tree.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.399
(man)
Coming up...

24:44.482 --> 24:47.903
{\an8}It's a (bleep) joke!
Who gives a (bleep)?!

24:47.986 --> 24:49.738
{\an8}(Gus)
It's my name that keeps getting
thrown in the dirt.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.239
{\an8}I'm just tired of it, man.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.200
{\an7}'Cause I grew up in a house
seeing women get disrespected.

24:53.283 --> 24:58.914
{\an8}So, when you sit here and accuse
me of that, it breaks my heart.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.876
♪♪

25:04.419 --> 25:05.754
{\an5}(Nilsa)
How did we get
home before them?

25:12.552 --> 25:14.429
Oh, man, oh, man.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.015
I gotta go change
my shorts.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.600
I can taste 'em
they're so far up my butt.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.811
I think, I think
my fart lingered in.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.855
He was farting in the car
the whole way here.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.193
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Is this pizza for me too?

25:28.276 --> 25:30.237
{\an5}(Candace)
I mean, if you want some.
It's-- I just made it.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.366
Well, I have PTSD from, um,
pizza because of Kayla Jo.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.700
{\an1}(Kortni)
Whoo!

25:35.784 --> 25:38.286
No one leaves their pizza
around the house anywhere.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.372
I don't know
what it is about Kayla Jo.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.623
Something about that girl that
just rubs me the wrong way.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.333
(Kortni)
Apparently she's a Wiccan.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.628
{\an5}What's a Wiccan?

25:43.416 --> 25:46.628
A witch.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.963
{\an5}The practicing...

25:46.711 --> 25:47.963
Oh!

25:48.046 --> 25:50.173
{\an5}The practicing
of witchcraft.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.173
No! No!

25:50.257 --> 25:51.758
Unh-unh! Unh-unh!

25:51.841 --> 25:52.425
Where's that
Jesus candle?!

25:52.509 --> 25:55.053
{\an8}She's a witchy barnacle.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.597
{\an8}Ha-ha-ha, Jeremiah,
look who's right?

25:57.681 --> 26:00.642
{\an8}I'ma get my Jesus candle,
and I am going to rebuke

26:00.725 --> 26:01.643
{\an8}this demon
in the name of the Lord.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.354
I knew it.
I had a bad vibe.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.563
What did I tell y'all?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.190
She's a witch?
That's so weird.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.149
Put that thing right
there in the middle.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.026
{\an5}I'm not kidding.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.026
No, no, no, no, no.

26:10.110 --> 26:14.948
{\an8}A Wiccan, that's, like,
a bitch flying off on a broom.

26:15.031 --> 26:19.160
Ooh, oh! I about dropped Jesus.
I'ma set it right there.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.495
{\an5}(Kirk)
Somebody already
dropped the other one.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.372
Not me and I think
it was the ghost.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.331
It was Kayla Jo.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.251
It was Kay--
(gasps)

26:26.334 --> 26:29.337
It all makes sense now.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.464
If she comes,
if she comes here tonight,

26:31.548 --> 26:33.591
I'll try to get her
to hold my rosary beads.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.927
If she doesn't,
then we'll know something's up.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.345
{\an8}I wanna get her back
to the house now,

26:37.429 --> 26:40.932
{\an8}hand her my rosary beads and
spill some, like, holy water.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.684
{\an8}Oh, I tripped and fell.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.020
See if she melts or starts
bubbling or whatever.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.896
You really think she's a witch,
like a real one?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.690
That's what I-- yeah.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.567
Like Salem Witch Trials witch?

26:50.650 --> 26:53.278
{\an1}We need to burn her
at the stake.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.573
Lord Jesus, please don't bring
this Wiccan into the house.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.991
And if you do, please know
I don't believe in that.

26:58.074 --> 27:01.202
I believe in you,
I'm Jesus's girl and that's it!

27:01.286 --> 27:06.207
{\an1}It's an ancient religious group
based on ancient witchcraft.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.459
Oh.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.710
So, they're modern--
modern-day witches.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.587
(Aimee)
I don't (bleep) with that.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.672
I don't either.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.923
{\an5}(Codi)
I'm gonna be careful
around here.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.801
I really am.
That scares me.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.636
{\an5}(Gus)
The girls are so
overdramatic in this house.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.013
{\an8}Codi, on the other hand,

27:20.096 --> 27:22.098
{\an8}loves to get in the middle of it
and just stir it all up.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.558
He's always starting all this
drama for no reason at all.

27:23.641 --> 27:24.893
So, I'm just tired of it.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.897
{\an1}Maybe that explains why
she is always where we are.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.941
{\an5}She always knows...

27:28.980 --> 27:31.941
She's a fortune teller.

27:32.025 --> 27:35.070
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
So, you guys are going
to, uh, La Vida?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.863
{\an5}(Gus)
I think that's the game plan.
Are you coming?

27:36.946 --> 27:38.615
{\an5}Negative, Ghost Rider.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.615
You staying home?

27:38.698 --> 27:41.409
Yeah, I just gotta
call Kayla Jo.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.120
{\an1}You better, uh, get control
of them in that room.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.373
{\an4}Why?

27:44.204 --> 27:46.373
Talk (bleep).

27:46.456 --> 27:48.375
{\an4}About me?

27:46.456 --> 27:48.375
Kayla Jo.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.168
What are they saying?

27:50.251 --> 27:52.504
{\an1}Talking about her being Wiccan
and blah-blah-blah and...

27:52.587 --> 27:56.758
Just being judgmental.

27:56.841 --> 27:59.969
It's not a surprise that
they're being judgmental.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.971
{\an1}Mostly just Nilsa and Aimee
for the most part.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.600
I hear everybody's--
Well, not everybody.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.435
Nilsa, of course,
you know who is still

28:07.519 --> 28:09.187
talking (bleep)
about Kayla Jo.

28:09.270 --> 28:13.566
So, she's just a (bleep).
That's what I've decided.

28:13.650 --> 28:17.070
{\an1}I don't know why people are
still acting so childish.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.780
Yeah, I don't want people
judging me for my beliefs.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.572
{\an4}I'm not gonna judge her
for hers.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.572
{\an3}Yeah?

28:19.656 --> 28:21.449
That's how I feel about it.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.493
I say you need
to ask 'em

28:23.576 --> 28:24.619
what their problem
with all that is.

28:24.702 --> 28:25.787
{\an6}Yeah.

28:24.702 --> 28:25.787
You know?

28:25.870 --> 28:28.623
So, I say we call it,
call it out.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.707
{\an3}Do it.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.959
Gus, he's helping me

28:31.042 --> 28:32.335
{\an8}(bleep) nip it in the bud
so to speak.

28:32.419 --> 28:36.005
{\an8}Because in the end, I don't want
them to think that I'm okay

28:36.089 --> 28:38.675
with them talking
about Kayla Jo like that.

28:38.758 --> 28:41.219
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Family meeting!

28:41.302 --> 28:43.221
Can I boycott
the family meeting?

28:43.304 --> 28:47.350
{\an8}Family meetings are always
negative, never positive.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.311
And they're also bull(bleep).

28:50.395 --> 28:53.148
This family meeting
is (bleep) stupid.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.027
(woman)
Coming up...

28:58.111 --> 28:59.612
{\an8}(Gus)
This guy over here
wants to call me a (bleep).

28:59.696 --> 29:01.156
{\an8}(Kortni and Candace)
Who?!

29:01.239 --> 29:01.823
{\an8}(Gus)
Farmer boy in the hat,
straight ahead.

29:01.906 --> 29:02.866
{\an8}(Candace)
Him?

29:02.949 --> 29:05.577
{\an7}Yeah?

29:02.949 --> 29:05.577
{\an9}What's up?!
What's up?!

29:05.660 --> 29:06.953
{\an8}Oh, hell no.

29:07.036 --> 29:07.996
{\an8}(bleep)

29:08.079 --> 29:11.791
{\an8}(shouting and bleeps)

29:11.875 --> 29:17.589
{\an9}What's up?!

29:17.672 --> 29:20.842
Okay, there is still
consistent chatter

29:20.925 --> 29:23.970
still going
about Kayla Jo.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.014
I don't understand why.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.766
And it just keeps coming
out of the same room.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.352
{\an1}Everybody
has talked about it.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.729
It's a joke, Jeremiah.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.189
Because I need
to actually figure out

29:34.272 --> 29:35.857
{\an5}what you guys were
talking about.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.857
It's not that serious.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.609
Well, then explain yourself.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.819
{\an1}So, I heard she was a Wiccan,
and it kind of scares me.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.573
{\an1}(Nilsa)
And that's what I said.

29:43.656 --> 29:44.741
{\an8}(Candace)
I do wanna know.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.910
{\an8}I wanna know if Kayla Jo
is a witch

29:46.993 --> 29:49.037
{\an8}because I don't rocks with that.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.371
I don't do witches.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.790
I don't do mythical creatures
and stuff like that.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.375
That's against my beliefs.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.462
{\an1}I just feel like this is just
another reason for her to start

29:57.545 --> 29:59.881
{\an1}more drama with Kayla Jo,
whether she should be scared

29:59.964 --> 30:01.633
{\an5}of her whenever
she comes around.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.633
Oh, just me?

30:01.716 --> 30:03.760
Did not everyone else
say something? Yeah.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.928
Everybody's joking about it.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.888
But they're not
scared of Kayla Jo.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.181
You are apparently.

30:08.264 --> 30:09.098
{\an1}The witchcraft--
I'm not scared of Kayla Jo.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.141
I'm scared
of the witchcraft.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.809
What does that
have to do with you

30:11.893 --> 30:13.311
if I'm scared of
the witchcraft?

30:13.394 --> 30:15.396
{\an4}(Aimee)
I mean, it's not that serious
if it's just a joke.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.232
I mean, she's not
one of our roommates.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.816
But I feel like out
of all the people

30:18.900 --> 30:21.444
that have tried to,
like, hurt Kayla Jo,

30:21.528 --> 30:25.198
{\an1}I think Nilsa's been the biggest
one, and she just won't stop.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.407
{\an1}Whether it's talking behind
her back or whether it's saying

30:26.491 --> 30:28.910
she owes her something,
whatever the case is.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.662
{\an5}I, I literally...

30:28.993 --> 30:30.662
{\an1}Because you have nothing but
problems with her in the past.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.455
Am I right
or am I wrong?

30:32.539 --> 30:35.792
{\an1}(Gus)
Right.

30:35.875 --> 30:36.960
I wasn't even the one
that started

30:37.043 --> 30:38.670
the whole witch,
Wiccan thing.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.588
That happened way
earlier today.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.174
{\an5}But I didn't hear any of that
when I came out of the shower.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.174
Be quiet, I'm talking!

30:43.258 --> 30:44.551
{\an5}And I just hear you.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.551
So, that's what I did.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.677
I'm talking.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.554
Don't you baby me
like this, all right?

30:47.637 --> 30:49.597
{\an5}I'm talking.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.597
You can talk to me
like an adult, all right?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.099
You wanna think that
you're this big...

30:51.182 --> 30:54.269
{\an1}You can talk to me like
an adult, all right, woman?

30:54.352 --> 30:57.730
{\an8}Nilsa needs to be very thankful
that she's not a dude right now

30:57.814 --> 31:00.775
{\an8}because I would literally
deck her, I'm pissed.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.318
I'm just saying, I joked
about it, I really did.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.987
{\an4}You know what? Next time
you wanna bring her over...

31:02.402 --> 31:03.987
I joked about it.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.822
And I didn't give a (bleep)
about joking about it.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.156
{\an5}What's that?

31:05.905 --> 31:07.156
How about you approve it
by all the roommates

31:07.240 --> 31:09.659
before you bring a guest
over because we all...

31:09.742 --> 31:12.203
How about you kiss my ass?
How about that?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.371
It's not the Jeremiah show,
is it?

31:13.454 --> 31:14.789
She's not gonna
be sleeping in your bed.

31:14.872 --> 31:17.208
{\an1}Why don't you kiss my ass
if you think I'm gonna do that.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.501
{\an1}Why do you talk
to women like this?!

31:18.585 --> 31:20.503
{\an1}Who taught you to talk
to women like this?!

31:20.587 --> 31:21.796
To talk down to them.

31:21.879 --> 31:22.839
{\an1}You haven't just
talked down to me.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.465
You talked down
to Aimee, too.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.467
{\an6}Oh, really?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.467
Were you raised like that?

31:26.551 --> 31:27.760
My brother was not
raised like that.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.804
Last I checked you
earn respect, honey.

31:29.887 --> 31:32.724
Level of respect from Nilsa.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.643
Or at least
what I had, you know?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.520
It's gone.
You wanna know why?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.689
Because you don't talk about
how I was raised whatsoever.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.233
(bleep) you,
all right?

31:42.317 --> 31:44.652
When it comes to women,
it's different.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.655
{\an1}You must not have been raised
in the true South, honey.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.283
{\an8}The difference between a
Southern gentleman and Jeremiah.

31:50.366 --> 31:51.784
Southern gentlemen,
they stand up for women.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.286
They don't disrespect women.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.662
They don't throw
low blows at women.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.831
(Candace)
Y'all, can we please chill?

31:56.914 --> 31:58.082
Do you want a shot?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.709
She needs a lot
more than a shot.

31:59.792 --> 32:02.587
Shut the (bleep) up, Jeremiah!

32:02.670 --> 32:04.297
{\an1}See, this is the kind
of (bleep) I'm talking about.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.174
Shut up! It'd done!
It's over with!

32:06.257 --> 32:07.258
I walked outside!

32:07.342 --> 32:08.551
Quit putting all
your focus on me!

32:08.635 --> 32:11.721
Like, come on!

32:11.804 --> 32:13.014
{\an1}We're having the talk
'cause y'all can't

32:13.097 --> 32:14.057
keep her out your mouth.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.683
That's why we're
having the talk.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.019
{\an1}Y'all have had something against
Kayla Jo from the get-go.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.480
{\an5}She's not our roommate.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.480
That doesn't have anything
to do with anything.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.440
{\an1}She's not even
Jeremiah 's girlfriend.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.025
{\an5}What, what, what is this?

32:22.523 --> 32:24.025
That's just the respect
for anybody.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.276
I'm the first one that won't
make fun of somebody's belief

32:25.360 --> 32:28.237
{\an1}'cause some of my best friends
are Muslim, whatever...

32:28.321 --> 32:30.615
{\an5}Okay, so...

32:28.321 --> 32:30.615
{\an1}So, don't come
in my room again

32:30.698 --> 32:32.367
{\an1}if you wanna sit there
and just eavesdrop

32:32.450 --> 32:34.786
{\an4}on what we have to say.
Go do your own thing.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.786
Can you let me finish?

32:34.869 --> 32:36.496
{\an1}And I'm not listening
to you anymore! No!

32:36.579 --> 32:38.539
It's a (bleep) joke.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.500
{\an1}I'm just saying have
respect for others

32:40.583 --> 32:43.336
{\an1}and don't talk
about 'em like that.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.672
Oh, my gosh, everybody
picks and makes fun.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.839
It's not that
(bleep) serious.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.425
We're (bleep) adults.
We're not children.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.219
{\an7}I pick all the time but
I don't pick on religion.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.512
(Aimee)
It's not that serious.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.056
You act like
everybody don't talk--

32:55.139 --> 32:56.641
{\an1}Oh, I'ma go (bleep) this thot.
Like, come on, now.

32:56.724 --> 32:57.892
When have I ever said that?

32:57.975 --> 32:59.018
Are we really playing
innocent like that?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.062
{\an1}When has that ever
left my mouth?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.230
{\an8}Oh, yeah,
we're going to the club.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.481
{\an8}We're gonna (bleep) some
(bleep) tonight.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.066
I haven't said
anything like that.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.318
But yet it's my name that keeps
getting thrown in the dirt.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.403
I'm just tired of it, man.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.779
I would love to sit 'em
down and ask

33:09.862 --> 33:11.447
what disrespectful
thing have I done to them?

33:11.531 --> 33:12.824
And give me
an example.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.117
I would love
to know.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.827
Like, I'm tired
of getting worked up

33:15.910 --> 33:16.828
over pointless
(bleep) like this.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.287
I wasn't poking fun
at the girl.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.497
All of y'all
were sitting there.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.873
{\an5}Everybody was.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.873
{\an3}We all did.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.291
We weren't poking fun,
we were being <i> funny.</i>

33:22.375 --> 33:24.544
{\an1}If y'all don't wanna talk
and just sit out there,

33:24.627 --> 33:25.503
I'll come out there.

33:25.586 --> 33:26.963
I don't give
a (bleep).

33:27.046 --> 33:28.840
All right,
then I'm coming.

33:28.923 --> 33:30.091
If y'all gonna keep running,
we're just gonna come out here.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.300
'Cause we gotta
stay out here and talk.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.885
{\an5}We're over it.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.885
I don't give a (bleep).

33:32.969 --> 33:33.886
No, if you wanna
accuse me and him

33:33.970 --> 33:35.263
of being disrespectful
to y'all,

33:35.346 --> 33:37.265
please give me an example
when we were disrespectful.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.350
Just don't (bleep)
start with me.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.269
Don't (bleep) start with me.
Don't (bleep) start with me

33:41.352 --> 33:42.353
'cause you're gonna
piss me (bleep) off.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.938
Can I not ask a question?

33:44.021 --> 33:46.774
It's a (bleep) joke.
Who gives a (bleep)?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.234
You calling me
disrespectful's a joke.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.027
That's not a joke.
Because I find myself being...

33:50.111 --> 33:51.154
Did I say, did I say
you were disrespectful?

33:51.237 --> 33:54.115
{\an5}Yes, you just--

33:51.237 --> 33:54.115
I said!
No! I said!

33:54.198 --> 33:57.160
I said we all make
fun and pick!

33:57.243 --> 33:58.703
It's a joke.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.874
{\an8}Jeremiah and Gus
are so freaking sensitive.

34:02.957 --> 34:06.502
They are, like, super in touch
with their "feminime" side

34:06.586 --> 34:07.462
or however you say it.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.920
I didn't say I was perfect.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.840
But I do pride myself on being
respectful towards women

34:10.922 --> 34:12.507
because I have two little
sisters and a mother

34:12.592 --> 34:14.135
that I love to death,
and I grew up in a house

34:14.217 --> 34:17.472
seeing women get disrespected,
and I don't put up with it.

34:17.554 --> 34:19.474
And so when you sit here
and accuse me of that,

34:19.556 --> 34:20.766
it breaks my heart.

34:20.850 --> 34:21.601
And I don't wanna hear it.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.726
(sniffles)

34:22.810 --> 34:25.353
Man, y'all getting...

34:25.438 --> 34:27.023
I can't stand around
somebody be start crying.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.690
{\an1}I'll start crying for real.
I can't do it.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.318
(sniffs)

34:30.400 --> 34:32.612
{\an5}(Kirk)
I can honestly
say Gus is probably

34:32.695 --> 34:33.654
the most respectful person
in this house.

34:33.737 --> 34:37.324
(sniffles)

34:37.408 --> 34:40.036
{\an4}(Codi)
It's okay, Gus,
it's all right, man.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.920
It's just, like, a super
sensitive topic for me.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.089
And, like, I just get so mad
when they're saying

34:52.172 --> 34:53.674
I'm disrespectful like that
'cause I work so hard not to be.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.135
(sniffles)

34:56.219 --> 34:57.887
Y'all don't understand some of
the stuff that I saw growing up

34:57.970 --> 34:59.138
'cause I don't talk about it.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.932
{\an1}You're right, and you don't
understand what I've been

35:01.015 --> 35:02.183
{\an4}through in the past
few years.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.183
And that's what I'm saying.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.726
I don't put up with
that from anybody.

35:03.810 --> 35:04.811
{\an1}So, if I'm doing that then
you tell me so I can fix it.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.647
That's all I wanted to know.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.277
{\an5}(Candace)
Please, Gus, I'm sorry,
stop crying, please.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.864
{\an5}I'm good.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.864
Okay.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.157
(sniffs)

35:20.451 --> 35:20.493
(sniffs)

35:25.790 --> 35:28.709
♪♪

35:28.793 --> 35:30.294
{\an5}(Aimee)
I don't have
a problem with Kayla Jo.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.379
Like, I said,
it was a joke.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.714
Sorry, Jeremiah,
won't do it no more.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.715
That's the end of it.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.717
I'm (bleep)
going out tonight.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.594
{\an5}(Jeremiah sighs)

35:36.801 --> 35:38.594
{\an3}Thank God.

35:38.678 --> 35:39.887
{\an8}(Candace)
After this house meeting,

35:39.971 --> 35:41.722
{\an8}I need, like,
a whole bottle of tequila.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.765
This is cute.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.100
Oh, I love that.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.977
Are you ready
for tonight?

35:46.060 --> 35:46.769
I am so ready
for tonight.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.896
Chi-chi's up.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.189
All right, let's go.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.232
{\an3}(Kortni)
Whoo-hoo!

35:51.315 --> 35:52.525
Let's go to the bar!

35:52.608 --> 35:53.943
{\an6}Bar!

35:52.608 --> 35:53.943
Let's go.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.486
No stragglers,
come on!

35:55.570 --> 35:57.446
(laughing)

35:57.530 --> 35:58.447
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
Side saddle.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.615
I'm sitting
in the back.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.075
(Kortni)
Going to Newby's.

36:01.158 --> 36:03.828
{\an1}I'm just ready to hang out with
your friends, Gus, I like...

36:03.911 --> 36:06.747
{\an5}Oh, yeah, uh...
forgot they were coming.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.747
Oh, (bleep) yeah.

36:10.543 --> 36:10.835
{\an3}Yes!

36:10.918 --> 36:14.088
{\an1}Whoo!

36:14.172 --> 36:15.590
{\an8}Some of my boys from back home,
they're in town tonight.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.676
{\an8}I am stoked.
I miss them boys so much.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.262
{\an5}What up, ladies?

36:18.759 --> 36:21.262
{\an3}Hey!

36:21.345 --> 36:23.139
{\an1}What's up?
What's up?

36:23.222 --> 36:25.308
So, I see this guy Matthew that
I met before in the past.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.101
So, seeing him again,
I'm, like, oh, okay.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.562
There's my dance partner.

36:29.645 --> 36:32.648
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
Here we go, here we go.
Drink up!

36:32.732 --> 36:36.944
{\an5}(Codi)
We need to put all of this
bull(bleep) behind us.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.696
Party, let loose,
have a good time.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.698
{\an8}That's what everybody
in this house needs.

36:40.781 --> 36:43.951
(music playing)

36:47.705 --> 36:49.123
(Gus)
Here you go.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.208
(cheering)

36:54.045 --> 36:55.630
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I see Jeremiah
alone at the bar.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.550
{\an8}Now's my chance, one-on-one,
without anyone else around

36:59.634 --> 37:02.219
{\an8}to try to understand
each other.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.097
Do I hate you?

37:05.181 --> 37:07.475
{\an1}Sometimes the (bleep) that
you say just drives me insane.

37:07.558 --> 37:11.437
{\an1}I wasn't talking about
anything personal with you

37:11.520 --> 37:13.981
{\an1}when you brought personal
(bleep) up with me.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.026
It's just that
things hit home for me

37:17.109 --> 37:19.570
when you do things to me,
when you say things.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.822
And I've been a victim
of those things.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.700
{\an1}You probably don't mean it
as any type of disrespect to me.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.494
But I take it like that

37:26.577 --> 37:28.287
because I was around
that for three years.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.873
{\an1}But in the end,
when you come at me

37:30.957 --> 37:33.125
as far as about my family,
that's when I get set off.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.127
{\an1}You don't talk
about my parents.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.380
You don't.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.924
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I really didn't mean to take
digs at his family

37:40.007 --> 37:42.885
and tried to explain what
I meant by that statement.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.470
You know, I shouldn't
have said anything.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.847
{\an1}Because I grew up differently
than a lot of my friends grew up

37:46.931 --> 37:50.643
because I grew up
in an interracial family.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.521
And so, I'm sure it hit home
for you because if somebody

37:53.604 --> 37:56.190
{\an1}would have said that to me,
it would've been the same thing,

37:56.273 --> 37:58.192
and I'm so sorry, and I did
wanna apologize about that.

37:58.275 --> 38:01.320
{\an5}Can we hug it out?

37:58.275 --> 38:01.320
{\an1}Yeah.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.197
I'm sorry and you're
still really cute.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.824
(Gus)
Back to the Jenga table.

38:04.907 --> 38:05.908
Go ahead and finger it.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.579
{\an1}There it is.
Okay, think you slick with it?

38:17.128 --> 38:19.880
{\an8}Who said (bleep)?

38:19.964 --> 38:20.881
{\an1}You gon' talk (bleep) about me.
Say it to my face.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.676
Don't be saying it
from a distance.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.302
Someone tells me
that he's yelling,

38:25.386 --> 38:26.137
"Cut your hair,
you (bleep)."

38:26.220 --> 38:27.471
{\an5}What's up, baby?

38:26.220 --> 38:27.471
I'm here.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.141
{\an1}You wanna say it to my face?
Say it to my face.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.142
{\an1}No! You wanna call me a (bleep).
Say it to my face.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.060
Don't say it from a distance.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.146
Wait, what?

38:35.229 --> 38:37.565
{\an5}You gonna talk (bleep),
say it to my face.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.565
(crosstalk)

38:37.648 --> 38:39.567
{\an5}I don't care if he's
a grown man or not, no.
I don't like him.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.652
He's just jealous, bro,
he's (bleep) jealous.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.698
{\an5}Let us deal with it.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.698
Let him talk (bleep).

38:45.781 --> 38:47.616
You be a bigger man, dog.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.827
I'm waiting.
I'm not going nowhere.

38:51.495 --> 38:51.954
You're about to get
your ass knocked off.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.081
(man laughs)

38:54.165 --> 38:55.291
{\an1}Bitch, I ain't--
You think I'm scared of you?

38:55.374 --> 38:57.209
{\an5}Look at you.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.209
(laughing)

38:57.293 --> 39:04.925
(Kirk)
Gus!

39:05.009 --> 39:06.594
♪♪

39:06.677 --> 39:08.262
Say it to my face.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.097
{\an1}You wanna say it to my face?
Say it to my face.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.766
{\an1}No! You wanna call me a (bleep).
Say it to my face

39:11.849 --> 39:15.561
Don't say
it from a distance.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.771
{\an5}You gonna talk (bleep),
say it to my face.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.771
(indistinct)

39:16.854 --> 39:18.481
I don't care if he's
a grown man or not, no.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.775
(Gus)
Some guy starts yelling at me.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.109
"Cut your hair, you (bleep)."

39:22.193 --> 39:24.612
{\an8}You don't say that word.
It's the same as the N word.

39:24.695 --> 39:25.780
{\an8}That is so offensive
and so degrading.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.074
{\an8}And I'm not gonna put up with it
from anybody.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.659
{\an5}I don't like him.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.659
No, no, he's
just jealous, bro.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.161
I'm not gonna throw the first
swing 'cause I'm not willing

39:32.244 --> 39:33.454
to go to jail
for some dumb ass at a bar.

39:33.537 --> 39:36.415
{\an5}Let us deal with it.

39:33.537 --> 39:36.415
Let him talk (bleep).

39:36.499 --> 39:37.625
Come on, let's go.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.959
And that's
when security came in

39:39.043 --> 39:40.086
and broke us apart.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.504
They told me
I gotta go this way.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.672
So, we went our separate ways.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.802
(chatter)

39:47.885 --> 39:49.470
{\an5}(Gus)
I'm mad (bleep)
kill that dude.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.096
You know what will happen
if he tries me!

39:50.179 --> 39:52.139
You've seen it!

39:52.223 --> 39:53.641
What happened?
Hold on, who trying you?

39:53.724 --> 39:55.142
What happened?

39:55.226 --> 39:56.977
{\an5}(Gus)
This guy over here
wants to call me (bleep).

39:57.061 --> 39:57.978
(Kortni and Candace)
Who?!

39:58.062 --> 39:59.146
Farmer boy in the hat
straight ahead.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.440
{\an6}Him?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.440
Yeah.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.775
{\an3}Bitch!

40:04.902 --> 40:06.654
{\an8}I'm very passionate about
protecting the people

40:06.737 --> 40:08.364
{\an8}that I know and love against
derogatory comments.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.824
He said farmer
boy in the hat.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.744
Who-- y'all three of y'all
in the hats, which one?

40:13.828 --> 40:14.995
{\an5}Which one?

40:13.828 --> 40:14.995
Watch out...

40:15.079 --> 40:17.289
{\an6}Which one?

40:15.079 --> 40:17.289
Not me.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.125
Which one? He said
farmer boy in the hat.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.001
I'm, like, all three
of y'all are grown men.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.586
Nobody wanna
say who said it?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.172
You was bold enough to say it
when nobody else was around.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.925
But now that the roommates
are around defending Gus,

40:28.008 --> 40:28.968
nobody wanna say anything.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.511
Gus! Which one?!

40:30.594 --> 40:32.012
{\an5}Left!

40:30.594 --> 40:32.012
(Candace)
Him?

40:36.809 --> 40:39.019
{\an5}You mad 'cause
he did yours?
What's wrong?

40:39.103 --> 40:39.979
I'ma step to you.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.647
{\an5}We the same height, boo.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.647
(laughing)

40:41.730 --> 40:42.481
{\an3}What's up?

40:42.565 --> 40:45.860
{\an7}I'm down,
I'll hit him first.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.027
{\an8}Are you (bleep).

40:47.111 --> 40:49.155
{\an8}(spectators)
Ohh!

40:49.238 --> 40:50.865
{\an8}And you ain't gon'
do (bleep) about it.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.158
{\an8}So sit down.

40:52.241 --> 40:56.078
{\an8}This guy definitely
messed with the wrong house.

40:56.162 --> 40:56.996
{\an7}What are you looking at,
you bitch?!

40:57.079 --> 40:58.706
{\an8}You ain't gon'
do (bleep) about it.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.207
{\an8}What you about
to do about it?

41:00.291 --> 41:01.000
{\an9}What's up?!

41:01.083 --> 41:02.376
{\an8}(Kirk)
Oh, hell no.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.502
{\an9}What's up?

41:03.586 --> 41:04.879
{\an8}It's about to go down.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.422
{\an8}(shouting)

41:06.505 --> 41:10.759
{\an8}(shouting and bleeps)

41:06.505 --> 41:10.759
{\an8}Where he at?

41:10.843 --> 41:12.636
{\an9}What's up?!

41:12.720 --> 41:14.597
{\an8}Where you at?!

41:14.680 --> 41:16.140
{\an8}(bleep)

41:20.895 --> 41:23.063
{\an8}(man)
Next time
on "Floribama Shore."

41:23.147 --> 41:24.023
{\an8}(door bell ringing)

41:24.106 --> 41:25.941
{\an8}That's Jeremiah 's brother?

41:26.025 --> 41:26.984
{\an8}(both)
You son-of-a-bitch!

41:27.067 --> 41:28.569
{\an8}He is a barrel-chested
freedom fighter.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.071
{\an8}This is what
I've been looking for.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.740
{\an8}(Candace)
I do not do water.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.241
{\an8}I don't do sharks.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.744
{\an8}(Aimee)
I'm not gonna let nothing
happen to you, come on.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.245
{\an8}Whoa! See it's a shark!

41:38.329 --> 41:40.039
{\an8}There it is, y'all.
