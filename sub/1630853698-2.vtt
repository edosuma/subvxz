- Okay, well, can you go on
without a drummer?

It was a year ago today

I'm back there painting.

your father and I to give you

03:39.958 --> 03:41.786
one year to pursue
that pipe dream.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.180
But guess what?
Today, that year is up.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.921

to get your suit pressed

and your shoes shined,

03:47.096 --> 03:48.402
and get your ass into the city

to find a real job.

to find someplace else to live.

what, like a thousand times.

I don't want
to be an accountant.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.502

- But in the meantime...

Can you please come out here
and talk some sense to him?

about this artist nonsense,

We sent you so you could get
an education and a real job.

you want me to do, huh?

04:23.175 --> 04:24.481
You want me to just
give up on my dream?

04:24.612 --> 04:25.830
Is that--is that what you want?

04:25.961 --> 04:28.137
- Yes, exactly.
And you know what else?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.052
Maybe you should come to mass
with your father and I.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.271

04:31.401 --> 04:32.924
for causing your parents
such heartache.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.884
Pray to Jesus to get you back
on the right path again.

whether or not

04:39.104 --> 04:41.803
I'm a painter or an artist
or an accountant or--

04:41.933 --> 04:43.631
- Maybe he doesn't, but we do.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.133
What's this big audition
you got anyhow?

05:08.264 --> 05:11.136
- Oh, it's actually
for an off-Broadway musical.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.182
But it's not just
for the ensemble.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.185
It's for one of the leads,
so it's kind of a big deal,

05:16.316 --> 05:19.667
and that's why I needed
to work on it this morning.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.408
Not that you would care.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.713

05:30.242 --> 05:32.810

05:32.941 --> 05:35.987
- Okay, so this is what
I'm thinking, right.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.946
I don't want to get a real job,
which means my parents

05:38.076 --> 05:39.121
are gonna kick my ass
out of the house,

05:39.251 --> 05:41.123
and I can't afford
a place on my own.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.953
So I was thinking
about asking Tammy

05:45.083 --> 05:46.998
if she wanted
to get a place together.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.000
- I think that
that is a great idea,

05:49.131 --> 05:50.915
as long as she agrees
to join the band.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.787
- Not gonna happen.
That was a one shot deal.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.832
- Can we forget about the band
for one second, okay?

05:54.963 --> 05:57.139
Dude, you realize Tammy would
never go for that, right?

05:57.269 --> 05:58.270
- Why do you say that?

05:58.401 --> 05:59.968
- 'Cause she's
a good Catholic girl.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.013
And living with you would be,
like, living in sin.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.973
Besides, even if she wanted to,
her mother would never have it.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.105
She'd sooner
cut your balls off.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.977
If you wanted to move in with
her, you'd have to marry her.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.761
- You know,
I have been thinking

06:10.892 --> 06:13.590
about the exact same thing.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.418
- Sorry, what?
- No.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.202
- Did you just say--did he just
say what I think he just said?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.508
- He did, he said it.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.076
- [laughing]
Why is that such a crazy idea?

06:21.206 --> 06:22.033
Huh?
I mean, we've been dating

06:22.164 --> 06:24.949
for what, almost a--a year?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.864
I know my mom keeps
asking me about it,

06:26.995 --> 06:28.431
and her mother keeps
asking her about it.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.606
And I know they both keep
seeing each other at church

06:29.737 --> 06:30.955
and asking each other about it.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.783
So I'm, like,
you know what? It's time.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.176
I love her,
I'm making Mama proud

06:34.306 --> 06:36.047
and I'm feeling good,
so why not?

06:36.178 --> 06:39.094
- Well, that's great that
your mothers are discussing it,

06:39.224 --> 06:41.270
but have you actually talked
to Tammy about this?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.012
- Yes, I have, Pags,
actually a bunch of times.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.230
And I know we've said,
you know,

06:45.361 --> 06:47.407
maybe we'd do it after
she gets her MBA and stuff.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.365
But now I'm thinking that
if I ask her to marry me now,

06:49.496 --> 06:51.236
she'll move in with me
if we're engaged.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.760
- Well, I think that's still

06:52.890 --> 06:54.283
classifies as living in sin,
my friend.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.154
- Yeah, I don't think there's
an amendment to the rule.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.895
- I also don't think
that this is the way

06:58.026 --> 06:59.201
that you should be talking

06:59.331 --> 07:01.508
about the rest
of your fucking life.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.988
Look, if you really get kicked
out, you can move in with me,

07:04.119 --> 07:06.861
but marriage,
it's a big deal, all right?

07:06.991 --> 07:08.950

there's the band to consider.

dude,

07:12.997 --> 07:15.043
I'm not coming at
this lightly.

07:15.173 --> 07:18.089
And besides, maybe my mom
kicking me out is a sign

07:18.220 --> 07:19.787
that now is the time
for me to do it.

about it, sláinte.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.222
I never stopped
busting my ass at this.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.137
Whereas you have
been doing what?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.530
Living the high life
and partying like a rock star,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.357
I assume, because the last
time I saw you,

08:52.488 --> 08:53.402
you were a fucking mess.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.012
- Who, me?
- [laughs]

08:55.143 --> 08:57.493
- No, never.
- Yes. Yes, you girl.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.408
Falling down drunk
outside of some club.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.236
I can't remember where, though.
Do you remember that?

09:01.366 --> 09:03.020
- Uh, if you don't
remember it,

09:03.151 --> 09:04.326
how the hell am I supposed
to remember it?

09:04.456 --> 09:06.241
Apparently,
I was the one that was wasted.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.156
- [laughing]Right.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.767
Well, it's good
to see you back at it.

09:10.898 --> 09:11.942
You looked great out there.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.162
- Thank you.
Still feeling a bit rusty.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.337
- Well, they called your name,right?

09:15.467 --> 09:16.991
- Mm-hmm.
- I know the director has

09:17.121 --> 09:18.383
taken a special interestin you.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.821
He's asked me about you
a couple dozen times.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.823
- Really?
What does he wanna know?

09:32.876 --> 09:34.443
- Oh, look who's here.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.054
So you got a plan for tomorrow?
- Are you asking me

09:37.185 --> 09:38.708
if I'm gonna go look
for an accounting job?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.275
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.842
But I do have
a little favor to ask.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.147
- Oh, you have a favor.
- Yes.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.540
- That's rich.
Well, I have a favor for you.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.933
Why don't you take
the laundry upstairs?

09:46.063 --> 09:48.979
- Mom, this is serious, okay?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.851
Remember when Baba died,

09:50.981 --> 09:53.331
you said that when it was time
to propose to Tammy

09:53.462 --> 09:55.943
that I could use
her old engagement ring?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.859
- Oh my God, are you serious?

09:58.989 --> 10:00.295
When did you
decide to do this?

10:00.425 --> 10:01.426
- Well, I don't know.
I've been thinking about it,

10:01.557 --> 10:03.254
you know,
and her and I talked about it.

10:03.385 --> 10:06.170
And I just thought,
if I love her, why wait?

10:06.301 --> 10:08.042
You know, why wait to start
the rest of my life?

10:08.172 --> 10:10.392
So I was thinking about
asking her tonight.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.046
- Her mother's
gonna be so happy.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.613
You know,
she calls all the time asking

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
when are you gonna make an
honest woman of her daughter?

10:15.919 --> 10:18.052
Oh my God, Mikey.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.489
This is such beautiful news.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.187
- What's going on here?
- Your son has just given us

10:23.318 --> 10:25.015
the most wonderful blessing.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.451
- You got a job.
- Even better.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.063
He's gonna ask Tammy
to marry him.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.065
- Is this true?

10:31.195 --> 10:32.849
- Yeah, Dad.
I love her.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.417
- Muchachito, por fin!

10:35.547 --> 10:38.202
[chuckling]
Come here big guy.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.248
Can't tell you
how proud I am of you.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.032
Your mother and I have been
praying for this day

10:42.163 --> 10:44.078
since the two
of you started dating.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.253
When do you plan
on asking her?

10:45.383 --> 10:46.994
- He's gonna ask her tonight.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.735
And he's gonna
use Abuelita's ring.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.998
- Wepa!

10:51.128 --> 10:53.565
You see, Mikey, you just
needed a good kick in the ass.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.524
Something
to motivate you to act,

10:55.655 --> 10:56.830
to take control of your--

10:56.960 --> 10:58.005
- Don't start, Victor.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.136
Just go get the ring.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.356
- Por fin!
[laughing]

11:03.227 --> 11:04.620
- Think he's a little happy?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.056
- I can't thank you enough,Matty.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.318
My son has been gone
for a year,

11:07.449 --> 11:09.320
and this is a perfect
little project for us.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.322
So I appreciate it.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.802
- I'd say this is more
than a little project.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.151
Good luck with it.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.979
- Thanks again.
- All right, man.

11:16.110 --> 11:16.937
- [whistles]

11:17.067 --> 11:18.460
Jimmy!

11:18.590 --> 11:20.636
Grab your camera,
grab your sister,

11:20.767 --> 11:22.159
and your mother
while you're at it.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.204
I got a little surprise
for the family.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.426
All right.
Now, would you please

11:28.557 --> 11:30.951
feast your eyes on that beauty?

11:31.081 --> 11:33.214
- Arthur,
what the hell is that?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.259
- Pretty great, right?
- No, not--

11:35.390 --> 11:36.304
not at all.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.001
Whose is it,
and why is it here?

11:38.132 --> 11:39.524
- It's for Jimmy.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.917
I just had to it towed over
from the junkyard.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.398
- Oh, really, the junkyard?
I never would have guessed.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.574
- And why exactly
would you do that, Arthur?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.403
- James, would you please
remind your mother.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.014
- Uh, I don't
really know, Dad.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.320
- You don't remember?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.104
High school graduation,
what did you want?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.584
You wanted me to get you
an old muscle car

11:55.715 --> 11:57.542
that we could
work on together.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.979
- Right.
- Right?

11:59.109 --> 12:00.284
I mean, come on,
look at this thing.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.373
This is the perfect
summer project for us.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.289
- Summer project.
Boy, you're in for it now.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.377
- Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy,
get over here.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.552
Do me a favor.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.859
I wanna document
the entire thing, all right?

12:09.990 --> 12:12.253
From today

12:12.383 --> 12:13.515
until we return it
to its former glory.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.517
- All right.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.519
- You look beautiful
together, Dad.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.565
Perfect couple.
- Yes, we do.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.263
- Arthur, this is the first
and last time

12:22.393 --> 12:23.307
I'm getting in this thing.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.222
- Famous last words, Mom.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.311
- I don't wanna hear it
outta you two.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.139
This thing is gonna be great.
Tell 'em, James.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.445
- Gonna be great, Dad.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.403
- So glad I'm not
his favorite.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.842
- You don't see the sign?

12:35.972 --> 12:37.365
Thanks.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.106
[sighs]

12:45.155 --> 12:48.028
[phone ringing]

12:51.031 --> 12:52.249
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.208
Can you talk?
- Yeah. What's up?

12:54.338 --> 12:56.688
- I think I have a potentially
huge problem on my hands.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.734
- What kind of problem?
- I think I need a change.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.302
Like--like a big change,
a radical change.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.738
- Is this is about Mikey?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.435
- I mean,
that's definitely part of it,

13:04.566 --> 13:07.264
but I don't know.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.396
[sighing]
I think it's somehow connected

13:08.526 --> 13:11.747
to playing
with the band last week.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.705
God, I don't know, Jill.
There was just something

13:13.836 --> 13:15.620
about being up
on stage with them

13:15.751 --> 13:16.752
that just brought something
out of me, you know,

13:16.883 --> 13:19.059
something that I've
never felt before.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.625
And it just is making
me rethink everything,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.584
My--like, everything.
My--my clothes,

13:22.714 --> 13:25.065
my God, my hair, my--
my entire life.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.110
I just feel like--

13:27.241 --> 13:28.503
[sighs]
I don't know.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.200
And to make matters worse,
I just heard from Mikey,

13:30.331 --> 13:32.768
and he's got some huge surprise
planned for me tonight,

13:32.899 --> 13:33.943
which is the last thing
I want to hear.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.205
- Tam, listen to me.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.511
You've been talking
about breaking up

13:36.641 --> 13:37.642
with him for months now.

13:37.773 --> 13:38.818
What are you waiting for?

13:38.948 --> 13:41.821
- I know.
I'm just--I'm scared, I guess.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.344
I've been waiting
for the right moment to do it,

13:43.474 --> 13:44.780
but it's just--
something always comes up.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.434
It's either his birthday
or my birthday

13:46.564 --> 13:48.218
or our anniversary
or Mother's Day or--

13:48.349 --> 13:51.091
- Mother's Day?
That's bullshit.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.701
The two of you
and your mothers,

13:52.832 --> 13:54.398
that shit's gotta stop.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.486
- It's hard.
I don't want to hurt him.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.619
What do I do?

13:57.749 --> 14:01.188
- You do what I've been telling
you to do for weeks now.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.798
You break up with him.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.452
And you do it sooner
rather than later,

14:04.582 --> 14:06.671
so you can get on
with your life.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.064
[woman]
Tammy, can I get some help?

14:08.195 --> 14:10.588
- All right.
Thanks.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.287
- Okay, everybody
who was asked to stay,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.115
please make your way back
to the stage.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.379
Once you find your places,

14:18.509 --> 14:20.468
we're gonna take it
from the top.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.513
- Before we get started,
the, uh,

14:22.644 --> 14:25.125
young lady in the back
with the purple stripes.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.388
Uh, Stacey Ross--

14:27.518 --> 14:29.216
- Stacey, that's you.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.435
- Uh--um, yeah, that's me.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.306
- Yeah, would you mind coming
to the front

14:32.436 --> 14:33.655
of the stage for a second?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.012
Stacey.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.405
You recognize me?

14:44.535 --> 14:46.711
- Um, no.
Should I?

14:46.842 --> 14:50.106
- You used to tend bar
over at Area, right?

14:50.237 --> 14:51.760
- Yeah.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.415
- I used to go in there
all the time, we would talk.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.504
- Uh, I'm sorry,
I don't remember.

14:56.634 --> 14:57.679
- You don't--
not ringing a bell?

14:57.809 --> 15:00.160
I used to--
shorter hair back then.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.685
Really?

15:03.815 --> 15:07.297
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, well, never mind.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.733
Let's get to it, then.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.910
- I'm sorry.
- No.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.478
- Okay, we'll have yellow
shirt move upstage for me.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.090
We'll have Stacey downstage.
Thanks, guys.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.093
All right.
And cue music.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.312
[upbeat music plays]

15:22.443 --> 15:23.879
Keep that same energy
as before, guys.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.361
Thanks.
And five, six, seven, eight.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.199
Nice.
Nice.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.334
Cleaner turn, Stacey.
That's it.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.336
Nice.
Smooth it out.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.301
- Oh, hey.
Sorry.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.564
Stacey, right?
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.740
- Hey, you were really
good out there today.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.351
- Yeah, just not good enough,
apparently.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.439
- Only have two leads
in the show,

16:02.570 --> 16:03.484
but, you know, keep at it.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.573
You got a career in this
if you want one.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.054
- Okay.
Well, maybe next time.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.664
- Hey, look.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.971
You really
don't remember me?

16:12.101 --> 16:13.407
I asked you out a few times.
I mean, obviously,

16:13.537 --> 16:15.757
you always said no, but--

16:15.887 --> 16:17.585
- Listen,
when you work in a club,

16:17.715 --> 16:20.588
a lot of guys talk to you
and a lot of guys ask you out.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.590
And it's kind of hard
to remember all those faces,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.332
but, um, I don't know,
it's good to see you again.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.595
Even if you didn't
like my dancing

16:27.725 --> 16:29.640
nearly as much as you,
apparently, like my bartending.

16:29.771 --> 16:30.946
- It's not that.
Just, I think, uh--

16:31.077 --> 16:33.166
- Listen, I don't need
the sob story, okay?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.994
I get it.
Good luck.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.869
- It's kind of great
how close our mothers are.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.175
Don't you think?
- Mm.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.480
- It's like they're sisters.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.004
They just talk all day,
every single day.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.615
- I don't know, I guess.
I mean, sometimes I feel

16:47.745 --> 16:50.531
like they're a little too
interested in our business.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.141
- Yeah, but I think of it
as a blessing, you know,

16:52.272 --> 16:54.013
for the future.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.624
Them getting along, you know,
and us being there,

16:56.754 --> 17:00.410
and them being there for us,
and helping us with things.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.760
- Oh, yeah, uh,
helping us with things.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.632
What do you--what kind of--
what kind of things

17:04.762 --> 17:05.807
do you think
we'd need help with?

17:05.937 --> 17:07.635
I mean--
- I don't know, well, you know,

17:07.765 --> 17:11.030
just things that couples plan
for in the future.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.467
- Oh, things that couples
plan for in the future.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.426
- Hey, do you mind if we just
take a seat real quick?

17:16.557 --> 17:18.515
- Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.824
[clears throat]
- So--

17:22.954 --> 17:24.260
so your mother didn't
say anything to you

17:24.391 --> 17:25.435
before you met me, right?

17:25.566 --> 17:27.568
- No.
Uh, was she supposed to?

17:27.698 --> 17:28.786
- No, that's good.
That's good.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.614
I just--I have something
I wanna ask you,

17:30.745 --> 17:32.268
and I want it
to be a surprise.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.270
- A surprise?
- Yes.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.666
Tammy, for about a year--

17:38.796 --> 17:40.494
- Uh, Mikey,
what are you doing?

17:40.624 --> 17:42.496
[clears throat]
- I'm proposing.

17:42.626 --> 17:43.888
What does it look like?
- I don't think--

17:44.019 --> 17:45.412
I don't think you should
do that right now.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.240
I don't, um--
- What?

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
Why not?
- Because, I don't--

17:49.198 --> 17:51.070
I don't think with us--
I don't think it's--

17:51.200 --> 17:53.289
I think it's too soon, maybe.
- Too soon?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
We've been dating for a year.

17:55.596 --> 17:56.771
- [sighs]
- We've talked about this.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.207
Our mothers have
talked about this.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.905
- Mikey.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.517
- Tammy, I--I thought
this was what you wanted.

18:05.432 --> 18:06.868
Tammy?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.829
Tammy, look at me.
- Look, I'm sorry.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.310
All right, I'm sorry,
I just--I can't.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.703
- Why not?
- Because, Mikey,

18:15.833 --> 18:18.488
I just don't--

18:18.619 --> 18:19.794
I'm--

18:19.924 --> 18:21.622
I'm just not in love
with you anymore, Mikey.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.322
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.504
- [no audible dialogue]

18:36.854 --> 18:39.857
[crying]

18:39.988 --> 18:41.772
Fuck, man.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.603
[sighs]

18:46.734 --> 18:48.214
- What you got there?

18:48.344 --> 18:49.737
Oh-ho, nice.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.000
Some dirty pictures.
Can I see?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.481
- No, I'm--they're just some
shots I took from the trip.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.135
- Oh, so this
is the new girl?

18:56.265 --> 18:59.050
Hm, let me see what you're
getting yourself into.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.704
Okay, Jimmy,
these are dirty pictures.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.315
- Would you--
just give me that.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.620
- Don't worry, Jimmy,

19:03.751 --> 19:04.926
I've seen boobs before,
plenty of them.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.667
- Yeah,
but not on my girlfriend.

19:06.797 --> 19:07.581
- Are you forgetting
all the times

19:07.711 --> 19:08.930
that I walked in
on you and Jill?

19:09.060 --> 19:10.410
Because I haven't
forgotten that.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.977
Unforgettable.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.503
By the way, was it weird seeing
her at the barbecue last week?

19:16.633 --> 19:18.113
'Cause I have to admit,
I was worried you two would

19:18.244 --> 19:19.767
see one another
and then that would be it.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.638
You'd be back
in the throes again.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.641
- Was it weird?
Yeah.

19:24.772 --> 19:28.515
Yeah. But I realized
when I met Maya,

19:28.645 --> 19:31.170
I needed to be with someone
who has the same dreams as me.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.433
You know, who's into
the same stuff I'm into--

19:33.563 --> 19:36.000
the outdoors, nature,
camping, hiking.

19:36.131 --> 19:39.003
- So basically someone who was
willing to have sex in a tent.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.614
- Hey, listen,
there worst things to be into.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.355
- [chuckling]

19:42.485 --> 19:43.834
Oh, she sure is a fox.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.534
And she looks sweet.

19:47.664 --> 19:48.970
Sweet fox.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.059
- Yeah, she is.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.278
I think you're gonna like her.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.801
- Good.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.456
I'm looking forward
to meeting her.

19:56.586 --> 19:57.544
Can I keep this
in the meantime?

19:57.674 --> 19:59.546
- Give me that.

20:01.939 --> 20:02.984
- So when are you gonna
tell Dad you're leaving?

20:03.114 --> 20:04.986
I assume you haven't
spoken to him yet.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.814
- No, not yet.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.468
- Well, I'd suggest you might
want to break the news

20:08.598 --> 20:10.078
to him sooner
rather than later.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.776
Like, before Maya gets here.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.039
You don't want her
to see your father cry.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.173
- You know what scares me?
That he actually might.

20:18.304 --> 20:21.045
- Want me to come along
for moral support?

20:21.176 --> 20:22.090
- Definitely not.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.745
- Hm, okay.
Hop to it.

Hey, Dad.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.235
How's it coming along?

20:36.365 --> 20:38.193
- Well, we've got our work
cut out for us this summer,

20:38.324 --> 20:40.369
but nothing
the Farrells can't handle.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.502
- Yep.
[laughs]

20:42.632 --> 20:44.112
There's something
we need to discuss.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.070
- Yeah, what you got, kid?

20:46.201 --> 20:49.639
- Well, it's about this girl
I'm seeing now, Maya.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.424
Just wanna make sure you guys
are okay with her staying here.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.729
- Yeah, totally.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.948
As long as you're smart
about it.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.732
Remember, the walls
in this house are thin.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.560
- Yeah, uh, don't worry,

20:57.691 --> 20:59.083
we'll be good with that.

20:59.214 --> 21:03.827
But, um, something else
we need to discuss.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.700
- What's going on?
You look worried sick.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.658
- Well,

21:08.789 --> 21:12.053
things went really well with
Bill Ford, like, really well.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.968
He likes me.
He says I'm a real good

21:14.098 --> 21:16.492
addition to the team,
and that's why he invited me

21:16.623 --> 21:17.841
on the trip to the Andes.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.278
- Yeah, well,
I would expect nothing less.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.975
- And, you know shooting
for National Geographic

21:21.105 --> 21:22.803
has been my dream forever.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
- Right.
So what is it?

21:24.805 --> 21:28.069
- Well, Mr. Ford then invited
me and Maya on his next job,

21:28.199 --> 21:29.070
and I said yes.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.160
And, um,

21:32.291 --> 21:35.598
I won't be around much this
summer to help with the car.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.912
- All right.
So let me get this straight.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.045
You said yes

21:48.176 --> 21:51.048
without talking to your mother
and father about it first?

21:51.179 --> 21:54.704
- Yeah, I mean, it's a really
good opportunity, right?

21:54.835 --> 21:56.837
Not for nothing,
but I'm 23 now, Dad.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.665
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
You are now old enough

21:58.795 --> 21:59.927
to make these kind
of decisions

22:00.057 --> 22:02.930
without consulting
with your parents first.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.933
All right.
So when do you leave?

22:06.063 --> 22:07.717
- Next week.
- Next week?

22:09.023 --> 22:10.285
Get the fuck
out of here, James.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.548
Next week--I get one week
with you this summer?

22:12.679 --> 22:14.289
- It was too
good an opportunity.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.596
I--it's my dream.
I had to say yes.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.600
- Well, what am I gonna do
with the Cougar, huh?

22:20.730 --> 22:21.557
What am I gonna do
with the Cougar?

22:21.688 --> 22:22.732
You think about that at all?
No.

22:22.863 --> 22:23.907
Of course you didn't
think about that,

22:24.038 --> 22:26.127
because I guess we don't
consult the father

22:26.257 --> 22:28.129
about these things anymore,
do we?

22:30.479 --> 22:32.612
I'll tell you who's gonna be
even more upset than me,

22:32.742 --> 22:34.178
it's your mother.

22:34.309 --> 22:36.920
- Actually, she seemed
pretty okay with it

22:37.051 --> 22:38.748
when I told her
and Genie this morning.

22:38.879 --> 22:39.967
- Your mother knows
and your sister knows.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.795
Everybody knows but Artie,
is that it?

that's left in the dark.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.667

Thanks a lot, pal.

how this gonna go.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.324
All right?

22:49.455 --> 22:52.588
I'm gonna go up to the bar
and drown my sorrows.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.329
And you,

22:54.460 --> 22:56.853
you can stay here
and fix the Cougar by yourself.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.465
Oh, by the way, have
a great time with Bill Ford.

that was fucking rough.

Who else would it be?

23:39.026 --> 23:40.419
- I don't know.
I was kind of hoping

23:40.549 --> 23:42.203
after you saw Jimmy last week,
you'd come to your senses.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.291
- What?
No.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.901
And you know,
not that a barbecue

23:45.032 --> 23:46.990
in Long Island isn't
a lot of fun.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.732
Sometimes you got to move on,
hence the gloves.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.647
- So why didn't he come up?
Is he afraid of me?

23:51.778 --> 23:53.257
- No.
I just figured you would

23:53.388 --> 23:54.998
be here and I wanted
to save him the trouble

23:55.129 --> 23:56.435
of getting
his balls busted by you.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.001
- Yeah, of course, I'd be here.
I live here.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.699
And it's my name
on the lease.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.831
- Your father's name,
don't you mean?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.268
- Same difference.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.661
You know, I hope you know
that he's never gonna

24:05.792 --> 24:06.836
leave his wife
for you, Jill.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.664
I hope you know that.
- [laughs]

24:08.795 --> 24:11.058
Yeah, I do.
And that's fine.

of this relationship.

Don't you care about
what you're doing to them?

- Have a good fucking night.

you throw them down, please?

to do with anything?

throw down my fucking keys.

Throw down my keys.

I'll throw 'em down.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.022
- Are you fucking serious?

25:46.153 --> 25:47.546
- You know what, I don't
need this shit from her.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.330
I'll gladly get a cab
if it means I don't have

25:49.460 --> 25:52.289
to listen to any more
of her bullshit.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.901
- Oh, great idea.
See you later, Hank!

25:55.031 --> 25:56.163
- You shut the hell up!

You, where the hell
are you gonna go?

25:58.295 --> 26:00.297
Huh?
- I'll go back to the office.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.343
I'll get cleaned up there.
No one will be in at this hour.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.345
It'll be fine.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.092
Are you going to be okay?

26:12.222 --> 26:13.963
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.055
