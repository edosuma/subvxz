WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:19.894
We begin…

00:25.734 --> 00:27.235
…in the waking world,

00:29.487 --> 00:33.616
which humanity insists
on calling the real world…

00:36.369 --> 00:40.040
as if your dreams have no effect
upon the choices you make.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.335
You mortals go about your work,

00:45.086 --> 00:47.380
your loves, your wars,

00:47.464 --> 00:51.050
as if your waking lives
are all that matter.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.475
But there is another life which awaits you
when you close your eyes…

01:03.063 --> 01:04.856
and enter my realm.

01:11.071 --> 01:16.076
For I am the King of Dreams…

01:19.204 --> 01:20.789
…and Nightmares.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.841
When the waking world
leaves you wanting and weary,

01:32.634 --> 01:35.011
sleep brings you here

01:36.513 --> 01:40.517
to find freedom and adventure.

01:51.402 --> 01:55.281
To face your fears and fantasies

01:55.365 --> 01:59.994
in Dreams and Nightmares that I create…

02:01.830 --> 02:03.915
and which I must control,

02:05.625 --> 02:09.170
lest they consume and destroy you.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.216
That is my purpose and my function.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.510
Or it was,

02:16.094 --> 02:19.722
until I left my kingdom
to pursue a rogue Nightmare.

02:23.685 --> 02:27.438
My Lord, you are coming back, aren't you?

02:28.022 --> 02:30.108
Why would I not return, Lucienne?

02:30.191 --> 02:32.652
I don't know, a presentiment.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.197
As powerful as you are here in your realm,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.076
Dreams rarely survive in the waking world.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.998
Nightmares, on the other hand,
seem to thrive there.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.300
Wake up, sir, we're here. Fawney Rig.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.176
Already?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.096
I must have dozed off.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.140
Thank you.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.064
Oh.

03:51.147 --> 03:55.026
Good afternoon, lad.
My name is Dr. John Hathaway.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.946
Of the Royal Museum?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.406
Are you here to see the Magus?

04:01.366 --> 04:04.619
Well, I've come
to see Mr. Roderick Burgess.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.918
Father likes to be called Magus.
It means sorcerer.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.336
Hmm.

04:35.441 --> 04:41.698
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

04:42.407 --> 04:48.496
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.293
The Magus will receive his guest
in the study, Alex.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.837
Yes, Mr. Sykes.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.221
Have you come to join Father's Order?

05:07.765 --> 05:09.726
The Order of Ancient Mysteries.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.063
Dr. Hathaway, what an unexpected pleasure.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.774
Alex, tea for our guest.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.902
Please, sit down.
You must be exhausted from your journey.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.321
Thank you.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.407
I take it you've reconsidered, then?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.909
After our meeting at the museum…

05:27.618 --> 05:29.078
I know what I said.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.582
I received a telegram this morning.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.917
My son, Edmund,

05:36.127 --> 05:40.923
his destroyer was
sunk last week, off Jutland.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.634
Oh, my condolences, Doctor.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.972
We are bonded

05:49.057 --> 05:51.476
then, in our grief, you and I.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.980
As you know, I lost my son Randall
recently at Gallipoli.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.733
Forgive me, I…

05:59.317 --> 06:02.820
I understood that
Randall was your only son.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.576
Randall was my greatest joy.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.916
All this was meant to be his.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.464
So, have you brought it,
the Magdalene Grimoire?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.016
If I give you the book…

06:36.020 --> 06:37.438
can you really…

06:38.064 --> 06:39.565
Capture the Angel of Death?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.609
Oh, yes.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.072
With the spells recorded in this book,

06:46.155 --> 06:49.450
we can compel Death
to return our sons to us.

06:50.159 --> 06:54.163
Your Edmund
and my Randall will live again.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.194
It's all right, Dr. Hathaway. Here.

07:46.466 --> 07:51.804
Tonight, we will achieve
what no one before us has even attempted.

07:52.430 --> 07:57.018
We will summon and imprison Death.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.647
Here in the darkness.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.608
Here in the darkness.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.208
Corinthian.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.215
My creations stay in The Dreaming.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.637
They do not walk amongst the living,
killing mortals for pleasure.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.140
Isn't this why you created me?

08:37.183 --> 08:40.686
Why should we confine ourselves
to their sleeping minds?

08:40.770 --> 08:43.940
Here, in the waking world,
we're unstoppable.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.527
There is nothing preventing us from taking

08:48.694 --> 08:51.447
whoever, whatever we want.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.699
There is though.

08:56.744 --> 08:57.662
My Lord…

08:59.372 --> 09:00.790
Please, no.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.917
No, no, no, I beg you.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.673
Please…

09:12.343 --> 09:15.471
Here in the darkness.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.446
I give you a coin made from a stone.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.615
Here in the darkness.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.202
I give you a knife from under the hills,

09:39.203 --> 09:43.374
and I give you the blood
from out of my vein.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.668
Here in the darkness.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.297
I give you a song I stole from the dirt,

09:49.964 --> 09:51.841
and I give you a feather

09:53.259 --> 09:55.678
pulled from an angel's wing,

09:55.761 --> 09:58.264
for you to lift up into the heavens.

10:00.683 --> 10:06.230
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:08.357 --> 10:13.738
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.991
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.160
I summon you with poison.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.956
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.584
I summon you with pain.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.961
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.422
I open the way, I open the gates.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.593
Here in the darkness.
Here in the darkness.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.804
I summon you
in the names of the old lords.

10:38.888 --> 10:44.060
Namtar, Allatu, Morax… Maborym calls you.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.687
Horvendile calls you.

10:47.355 --> 10:52.818
We summon you together. Come!

11:33.067 --> 11:33.901
Alex.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.737
Alex!

11:44.370 --> 11:45.704
Get that pouch for me.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.957
But be careful.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.335
Don't break the binding circle.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.344
Hmm. Sand.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.266
Now the jewel. There.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.601
Good.

12:09.895 --> 12:14.650
Well, let's see
what other treasures you have for us.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.488
-The bird!

12:21.949 --> 12:25.286
-Father!
-No! No! Stop.

12:37.089 --> 12:37.923
Move.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.105
Hmm.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.776
We'll let our guest recover

12:58.360 --> 13:00.362
before we tell him our demands.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
Guards, watch him.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.664
I was powerless,

13:11.499 --> 13:14.376
trapped by a spell cast by an amateur

13:14.460 --> 13:19.298
with no concern for the damage
he had done to my realm

13:20.549 --> 13:21.509
and to his own.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.596
For the following morning,
there were some sleepers…

13:25.679 --> 13:26.722
Unity.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.933
…who could not wake up.

13:29.016 --> 13:29.934
Unity.

13:33.187 --> 13:36.857
Rise and shine, dormouse.
Can't have you late to school, can we?

13:38.651 --> 13:43.656
Luvvie? Wake up. Unity?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.992
-What's wrong?
-Call the doctor.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.037
Hello, operator.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.718
The sleepy sickness,
as it was called,

14:04.802 --> 14:08.847
affected nearly one million men,
women and children

14:08.931 --> 14:12.893
in every city, town
and village in the world.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.066
Sykes! Alex!

14:26.073 --> 14:27.074
Oi!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.660
Good morning, Magus.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.799
Do I know you?

14:43.883 --> 14:48.679
No, but I know all about you, Roderick,

14:49.346 --> 14:52.766
and the being
you've trapped in your cellar.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.563
Blackmail then, is it? A shakedown?

14:58.188 --> 15:01.066
Not at all. I'm here to help you.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

15:14.788 --> 15:18.292
There are benefits
to keeping one of The Endless close.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.046
The Endless?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.090
Did you think Death
was the only one in charge?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.801
The Reaper has family, you know.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.804
Desire, Destiny, Despair.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.933
Which one have I got then?

15:34.516 --> 15:35.392
Dream.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.979
What's the good
of a god who governs dreams?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.064
Not a god.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.775
More than a god.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.236
And are men not governed by their dreams?

15:46.904 --> 15:48.280
You've taken his vestments?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.908
The ruby, the pouch and the helm?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.995
-They can lend you an aspect of his power.

15:56.413 --> 16:00.626
Extend your lifespan,
allow you to manipulate others.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.255
But you must ensure that he never escapes.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.257
The binding circle is intact.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.343
The circle will not be enough.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.931
You must construct
a sphere of glass inside the circle

16:14.014 --> 16:16.892
to contain Dream's physical manifestation.

16:19.436 --> 16:23.190
No one must be allowed
to fall asleep in his presence, no one,

16:23.273 --> 16:26.485
or he will escape into your dreams.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.113
And you don't want that.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.824
There are Forced March tablets.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.787
Stimulants used to keep
trench soldiers awake.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.499
See that your guards
use them at all times.

16:43.293 --> 16:47.548
Um… Why are you helping me?
What… what is he to you?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.592
Well, you could say that
he made me what I am today.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.722
And if he ever gets free,
he could take it all back.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.018
We're being observed.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.936
What? There's nobody here.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.195
Well,
you'll have to deal with that one.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.488
Her name is Jessamy.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.115
She belongs to him.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.952
Best of luck… to the both of us.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.580
Will I see you again?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.665
You should hope not.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.896
You can go.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.655
Are you awake?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.409
Are you listening?

18:09.546 --> 18:10.964
I know who you are…

18:13.175 --> 18:14.593
Dream of The Endless.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.184
I captured you
according to the laws of magic.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.646
But it wasn't you I wanted.

18:26.438 --> 18:30.192
I wanted Death to return my son Randall,

18:30.818 --> 18:33.362
who died in the Gallipoli Campaign.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.036
If you give him back to me,
alive and well,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.288
I'll release you.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.169
Is that in your power, Lord of Dreams?

18:54.049 --> 18:55.384
No, I suppose not.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.558
So, then, what can you give me?

19:05.185 --> 19:08.480
If I let you go,
if I promise to give you back your things.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.442
What, power? Wealth? Immortality? Hmm?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.739
Is there nothing you can offer me?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.165
Well, have it your way then.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.459
And until you're ready to speak,

19:31.545 --> 19:34.006
I'll enjoy the gifts
you've already given me.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.655
Day after day,
he pleaded for gifts

19:58.739 --> 20:03.118
that are not mankind's
to receive nor mine to give.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.038
So I remained silent.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.124
And ten years later…

20:09.208 --> 20:10.751
-Enjoy yourself.
-Of course.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.462
…though my presence there
remained a secret,

20:14.004 --> 20:18.675
my ruby, sand
and helm brought youth and prosperity

20:18.759 --> 20:21.261
to Roderick Burgess and his followers.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.429
Enjoy yourselves.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.932
But for the rest of the world,

20:25.807 --> 20:28.101
the suffering continued.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.187
Alex.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.526
You're supposed to be working,
not reading.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.488
Don't let your father catch you.

20:58.799 --> 20:59.758
Good evening.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.473
Excuse me, I'm afraid that there's
no more room inside this evening.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.143
-But if you'd all come back tomorrow--
-Been out here for hours. We're not goin'.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.729
But, I'm afraid that the Magus insists.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.940
Oh, the Magus insists, does he?

21:15.023 --> 21:18.360
And who are you to speak for the Magus?
Who the fuck are you?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.028
He's the Magus' son.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.447
You fucking twat.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.951
And he can do magic too.

21:28.078 --> 21:28.954
Can't you?

21:30.497 --> 21:34.501
Do you want him to put a curse on you?
Hex you and all your unborn children?

21:34.584 --> 21:37.838
No? Then you should leave right now.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.968
-Can we still come back tomorrow?
-Can they?

21:44.886 --> 21:48.015
Yeah. If they bring cash.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.851
Well, you heard him. Cash only.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.561
Now, piss off.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.567
Thanks for that.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.360
You didn't need my help.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.072
I'll bet you can do magic, can't you?

22:05.198 --> 22:07.326
Can't do much of anything, really.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.453
That's not true.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.497
You're more powerful than you know.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.126
You can get me in to see the Magus.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.440
I'm not staying with that thing
one second longer than I have to.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.317
We can't just leave him alone.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.694
Why not?
He's in his cage, isn't he?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.946
Sometimes
I wonder about this job.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.115
Really, "sometimes"?

22:47.199 --> 22:49.034
-I do not have the--
-Morning.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.620
-You seen Noel and Maurice?
-No.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.081
They're nearly half hour late.

22:55.999 --> 22:59.419
Uh, I could… watch him,

23:00.587 --> 23:02.672
until they get here, if you wanted to go.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.720
-See you tomorrow.
-Cheers, Alex.

23:45.882 --> 23:46.800
Hello.

23:55.433 --> 23:59.479
It's Alex. The Magus' son.

24:04.025 --> 24:07.779
See, I don't know
whether you can speak or…

24:08.905 --> 24:11.074
or even understand me, but

24:13.034 --> 24:14.619
I just wanted to ask…

24:19.624 --> 24:21.001
Are you all right in there?

24:30.010 --> 24:32.345
No, of course you're not.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.436
I'm… I'm sorry about all of this.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.857
He's not a bad man,
my father, he… he just…

24:48.028 --> 24:51.698
See, if you could bring Randall back,

24:52.574 --> 24:55.660
or… or just give him something, anything.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.288
Or even just speak to him.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.665
Then I am sure he would let you out.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.256
See, I… I would let you out

25:10.133 --> 25:11.343
if I could.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.474
You would, would you?

25:22.020 --> 25:24.689
-What were you doing down there, huh?
-Nothing.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.901
You were plotting his escape, weren't you?
Conspiring against me?

25:27.984 --> 25:28.944
-Hmm?
-No, Father.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.655
-What did he say to you?
-He didn't say anything.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.074
Know what would happen if you let him out?

25:34.157 --> 25:35.867
I won't, Magus. I promise.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.035
He'd slaughter you.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.704
He'd slaughter all of us.
Is that what you want?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.749
Is it? Do you wanna die, Alex? Do you?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.335
'Cause if you do, it's relatively simple.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.171
Fuck.

25:50.131 --> 25:50.966
Roddy?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.386
What is it? What's wrong?

25:56.012 --> 25:57.055
It's Jessamy.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.890
Who's Jessamy?

25:58.974 --> 26:01.977
I've been trying to shoot
this wretched bird for ten years now.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.689
It can't be the same bird, can it?

26:10.318 --> 26:13.947
-Did he tell you to say that? Did he? Hmm?
-No, Father. He didn't say anything.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.284
Prove it to me.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.369
Shoot the fucking bird.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.292
Ethel.

28:21.616 --> 28:22.700
Fucking hell.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.621
-Shall we call the fire brigade?
-We are the fire brigade. Come on.

29:30.643 --> 29:34.314
Idiot. You could have shattered the glass.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.945
Clear that mess up.

30:24.197 --> 30:27.200
The savagery
of my captors bespoke a world

30:27.283 --> 30:31.913
whose dreams in my absence
turned darker still.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.375
A world which would soon be at war again.

30:36.543 --> 30:40.672
A world still ravaged by the disease
which doctors named…

30:41.339 --> 30:43.716
encephalitis lethargica.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.136
I just want to sleep, please.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.973
Some begged for sleep
that would not come.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.560
Others lived as perpetual sleepwalkers.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.981
Most slept without waking.

31:01.484 --> 31:02.318
Sorry, sir.

31:03.653 --> 31:04.821
What's that you're reading?

31:04.904 --> 31:05.864
Uh…

31:05.947 --> 31:09.242
I'm afraid I'm doing much more sleeping
than I am reading at the moment.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.372
Have you read Vile Bodies?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.875
Now that'll keep you awake.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.443
You all right?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.032
Well, I'm going to have a baby.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.077
That's wonderful news.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.959
He wants me to get rid of it.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.965
In fact, he's…
calling the doctor right now.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.524
I'll be fine.

32:30.782 --> 32:31.783
Not your worry.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.602
What is it? What's wrong?

33:01.270 --> 33:02.438
She's taken it all.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.526
The helmet, the pouch,
the ruby, the grimoire,

33:07.276 --> 33:08.861
and 200,000 in cash.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.990
She's taken far more than that.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.660
Find her. Bring her back here now.

33:15.743 --> 33:16.619
Where are you going?

33:16.703 --> 33:19.831
To see how badly Dream of The Endless
wants out of his cage.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.920
The woman who lives with me has gone

33:27.088 --> 33:29.424
and robbed me of my fortune.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.427
She's also robbed you.

33:34.178 --> 33:39.434
She's taken your helm,
your sand and your ruby.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.147
Now, I can unlock this,
you can go after her…

33:47.025 --> 33:49.986
if you give me what I've been asking for.

33:51.696 --> 33:55.450
Wealth, youth, immortality.

33:57.618 --> 34:00.204
Oh, you're a god.
These things are nothing to you.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.001
Don't you want your weapons
and your freedom?

34:08.546 --> 34:12.884
Speak to me! Speak to me! Speak to me!

34:12.967 --> 34:15.470
-Come on! Speak to me!
-It's all right, Father.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.679
Get away from me.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.307
If you were any kind of son to me…

34:23.102 --> 34:25.021
If Randall were alive today--

34:25.104 --> 34:27.690
If Randall were alive,
he would hate you as much as I do.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.282
Sir?

34:44.415 --> 34:46.000
You're never getting out of there.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.129
Never.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.266
Sir, can you hear me?

35:05.311 --> 35:06.145
Sir?

35:06.854 --> 35:09.649
He's not moving. Is he…

35:12.235 --> 35:13.111
He's dead.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.161
Don't do it, sir.

36:03.995 --> 36:04.996
He'll kill us.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.375
What would your father say?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.386
I need to think.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.070
Sir?

36:40.656 --> 36:41.908
Are you all right?

36:43.576 --> 36:44.744
My father, he, uh…

36:48.039 --> 36:49.207
He's dead.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.252
I'm so sorry, sir.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.639
I'm so sorry, Alex.

37:15.775 --> 37:19.070
Out of loss, new love was born,

37:20.321 --> 37:21.781
as was new life.

37:22.531 --> 37:27.078
For nine months later,
Ethel Cripps gave birth to a son.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.081
My mum used to say that if I was good,

37:31.707 --> 37:33.751
when I went to sleep, a man would come,

37:34.335 --> 37:35.962
sprinkle sand in my eyes.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.010
Make all of my dreams come true.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.098
But the Sandman's not coming.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.725
From now on, Johnny,

37:51.519 --> 37:54.522
you and I are going to have to
make our own dreams come true.

37:56.899 --> 38:02.863
And nothing and no one
is going to stand in our way.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.380
How is he today, Rogers?

38:19.463 --> 38:20.715
Buggered if I know, sir.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.843
Moved his hand this morning. Right hand.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.894
Oh, my God.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.232
Alex?

38:42.778 --> 38:43.612
Hello.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.034
This is my friend, Paul.

38:50.870 --> 38:55.583
Paul, this is our unwilling guest.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.671
Look, we've been talking, Paul and I,

39:01.714 --> 39:03.257
and if I let you out,

39:05.134 --> 39:07.511
will you promise not to harm us?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.685
If you could just speak to us.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.398
You see, I told you.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.567
I'm telling you, you have to keep trying.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.653
Show him that he can trust you.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.448
Show him that you mean it.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.828
I do mean it.

39:35.247 --> 39:39.251
Just promise that
you won't harm me or Paul,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.254
and I will let you out.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.759
Should I have
believed him this time?

39:48.719 --> 39:51.639
Should I have forgiven him
for murdering my raven?

39:54.308 --> 39:55.309
Perhaps.

39:56.644 --> 39:57.812
But in the end…

40:00.481 --> 40:01.690
I could not.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.860
I could have
asked you for wealth

40:04.944 --> 40:07.613
or power, like my father did.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.909
But all I ever wanted
was to be free of you.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.958
Surely you want that too.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.798
Alex, darling, please.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.893
Take me upstairs, Paul.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.647
I won't be coming down here again.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.017
Old Dracula here's not givin' an inch.

41:19.685 --> 41:23.481
-Why do you call it Dracula?
-'Cause I think it's one of them Draculas.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.399
What do you think it is?

41:26.108 --> 41:27.109
I try not to.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.112
You know what I think about?

41:31.363 --> 41:32.198
Majorca.

41:33.365 --> 41:36.619
Four days… and I'll be on a beach.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.289
-Stinking of suntan lotion.
-Lucky bugger.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.167
I was on Corfu on holiday once.

41:43.250 --> 41:47.004
I met this right fit type
at the hotel in the morning…

42:45.604 --> 42:46.438
Fred!

42:48.941 --> 42:50.359
Fred, stop it! You'll… Fred!

42:54.488 --> 42:56.657
Don't move! Stay where you are!

42:56.740 --> 42:59.076
What… what's he got in his hands?

42:59.660 --> 43:01.954
Oi! Open your hands, now!

43:30.482 --> 43:31.483
Paul?

43:48.375 --> 43:49.835
-Well, hello.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.128
Where did you come from?

44:07.853 --> 44:08.771
Hello.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.690
It's… it's you.

44:12.941 --> 44:15.361
You're… you're free.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.071
I am.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.745
And you have any idea what it was like?

44:25.454 --> 44:28.540
Confined in a cage for over a century?

44:30.209 --> 44:34.129
Do you understand the damage
you've done to your world?

44:34.213 --> 44:39.051
I'm sorry. I… I didn't know. Please.

44:39.134 --> 44:42.096
Your punishment, then, shall be a gift.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.264
I give you this,

44:45.307 --> 44:50.896
the gift… of eternal… sleep.

44:56.652 --> 45:00.489
-Alex. Alex, wake up, please.

45:01.073 --> 45:03.951
More than a century
of tortured sleep,

45:04.034 --> 45:06.954
of Dreams and Nightmares running riot

45:08.539 --> 45:10.040
was coming to an end.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.291
He's free.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.630
He's out of his cage.

45:28.058 --> 45:31.478
So, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to run.

45:33.730 --> 45:39.361
And I'm not gonna stop
until I've reshaped this world

45:41.196 --> 45:43.699
to look just like me.

46:03.427 --> 46:06.763
Sir. Sir!

46:08.223 --> 46:10.267
Oh, my goodness.

46:10.893 --> 46:11.852
Sir.

46:12.811 --> 46:13.979
It's me.

46:16.648 --> 46:17.983
It's Lucienne.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.530
Lucienne.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.159
You're home, my Lord.

46:27.784 --> 46:29.036
I am.

47:11.411 --> 47:15.999
Forgive me, sir, but… the realm,

47:17.459 --> 47:18.669
the palace…

47:20.921 --> 47:22.923
they are not as you left them.

47:45.487 --> 47:47.114
What happened here?

47:48.407 --> 47:49.449
Who did this?

47:52.244 --> 47:54.913
My Lord, you are The Dreaming,

47:55.622 --> 47:57.374
The Dreaming is you.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.502
With you gone as long as you were,

48:00.586 --> 48:03.714
the realm began to… decay

48:04.798 --> 48:05.882
and crumble.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.177
And the residents?

48:11.013 --> 48:12.389
The palace staff?

48:13.599 --> 48:15.642
I'm afraid most have

48:17.269 --> 48:18.186
gone.

48:18.770 --> 48:21.481
-Gone?
-Some went looking for you.

48:23.108 --> 48:24.234
And the others?

48:26.862 --> 48:31.533
They thought, perhaps,
you'd grown weary of your duties

48:33.201 --> 48:34.703
-and--
-What?

48:37.164 --> 48:38.373
Abandoned them?

48:40.375 --> 48:42.210
Had they so little faith in me?

48:44.046 --> 48:46.006
Do my own subjects not know me?

48:46.673 --> 48:48.300
If I may, sir.

48:49.092 --> 48:51.511
It wouldn't be the first time
one of The Endless had just--

48:51.595 --> 48:52.512
Enough.

48:54.181 --> 48:57.809
I will not have Dreams and Nightmares
preying on the waking world.

48:57.893 --> 48:59.478
I will bring them all back.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.943
I made this realm once, Lucienne.

49:10.155 --> 49:11.657
I will make it again.

49:33.136 --> 49:34.471
I knew you would return.

49:34.554 --> 49:35.931
The Dreaming must be restored.

49:37.265 --> 49:39.309
You want me to kill the King of Dreams?

49:39.393 --> 49:41.561
You just have to trust me.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.314
Whatever's happening,
however it's happening,

49:44.398 --> 49:45.816
your dreams are coming true.

49:46.858 --> 49:48.819
I'm worried about my brother.

49:48.902 --> 49:51.905
I need your help. If dreams disappear,
then so will humanity.

49:51.988 --> 49:53.156
You have to do something.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.784
Fuck it!
Let's go to Hell.

49:57.869 --> 50:00.956
What power have Dreams in Hell?

50:01.707 --> 50:04.835
Nightmares do not belong
in the waking world, Corinthian.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.211
Oh, turns out I fit right in.

50:07.546 --> 50:10.632
Can I get you anything you desire?

50:12.092 --> 50:15.762
Your kingdom is my birthright.

50:15.846 --> 50:18.348
Can you imagine the damage he could do?

50:19.725 --> 50:22.144
You don't think Dreams can die.
Let's find out.

50:23.103 --> 50:25.063
-Boss!
-Still with us, Dream?

50:25.147 --> 50:27.315
Dreams don't fucking die.
