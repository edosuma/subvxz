WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:06.640
Let the fun commence.

00:08.680 --> 00:10.880
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:14.240 --> 00:18.280
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.360 --> 00:21.520
'But what they don't know is

00:21.600 --> 00:25.120
there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.200 --> 00:27.880
My arse fell out of my shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:27.960 --> 00:29.920
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.880
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:32.960 --> 00:36.680
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:36.760 --> 00:38.440
(cheering)

00:41.360 --> 00:44.200
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.280 --> 00:46.520
I do really, really love him.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.000
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.080 --> 00:52.360
(screaming)
Let go now!

00:52.440 --> 00:54.560
No-one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.680
'And others just want
to wreck the gaff.'

00:57.760 --> 01:00.560
(shattering)

01:02.000 --> 01:03.800
That'll be someone's head.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.320
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment.'

01:07.400 --> 01:09.720
It's gonna be fireworks.
'Causing misery.'

01:09.800 --> 01:12.040
(crying)

01:12.120 --> 01:14.200
You will never, ever
have me ever again.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.040
'Mayhem.'
Fucking dickhead.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.760
(screaming)

01:17.840 --> 01:20.000
'And madness.'

01:20.080 --> 01:22.880
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:22.960 --> 01:25.040
You fucking what?

01:28.400 --> 01:31.000
'Four exes have already arrived.'

01:31.080 --> 01:33.160
'Whose...'

01:33.240 --> 01:34.960
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.440
'...ex...'

01:36.520 --> 01:39.000
'...is...'

01:39.080 --> 01:40.560
'...next?'

01:40.640 --> 01:42.480
My heart is breaking.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.520
It takes someone really special
to come along

02:08.600 --> 02:11.760
and get me to open up.
It was nice to get time with her.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.520
Have a little proper chat.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.520
Get a little bit deep,
yeah, have a little kiss.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.800
This morning, I've woken up
and I'm feeling emotionally drained.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.440
I feel bad about
what I'm doing to Ross,

02:24.520 --> 02:27.120
but at the same time,
I still fancy Jack.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.960
It is nice to have him here.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.000
How do you feel, though?

02:36.360 --> 02:38.200
(exhales loudly)

02:38.280 --> 02:41.440
I made a mistake by letting Jack
take her off my hands.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.440
I'm not gonna let that happen.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.400
Why was I such a dick last night?

02:49.480 --> 02:53.240
I should have acted differently,
it could have been different.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.640
I still love her, like.
Of course I love her.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.320
I wanna win her back.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.280
It is absolutely over
between me and Alex.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.440
Sean's mine now and we can't
keep our hands off each other.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.600
Sex with Zahida was boring.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.360
I'm keeping my options open.
I will go back there,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.720
but I'm also gonna look elsewhere.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.600
I woke up this morning
and I was alone,

03:28.680 --> 03:31.520
but there's a lot
of fanciable guys in the house.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.280
I love boys. I love cock.
Big cock, small cock.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.280
I am absolutely gagging.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.680
'Eloquently put, Maisie.'

03:40.760 --> 03:44.520
'Luckily, the Tablet of Terror
has sent them to find some action.'

03:44.600 --> 03:47.640
'At, where else? The water park!'

03:51.080 --> 03:52.760
Fucking love water parks.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.400
Finally time to get wet.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.600
I love a wet tunnel. Oi, oi!

04:23.960 --> 04:26.640
'While the others
are busy getting wet,

04:26.720 --> 04:30.720
Josh is getting to the bottom of what
happened with Jack and Harriette.'

04:30.800 --> 04:34.000
So, obviously, you and Harriette
went to the penthouse?

04:34.080 --> 04:37.160
Yeah, yeah.
We had a little kiss and that.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.000
Fuck off.
She don't regret what happened.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.800
The ship sailed mate,
crack on with someone else.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.920
How do you feel about me
having a chat with Harriette?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.800
Mate, have a little chat with her.
I know how we stand.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.000
It's time to get her back.
Do you know what? It's game on.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.600
(laughs)

05:06.320 --> 05:08.800
Ross likes the taste
of custard pie, I think.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.760
He's already had one in his face.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.320
So, if he wants another one,
let him crack on.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.360
I love Sean's face. And his dick.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.800
I can literally look at his willy,
even if he's wearing shorts

05:23.880 --> 05:24.960
and he gets a stiffy.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.000
I just wanna spend my time with you.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.360
That's what I wanted
from the start anyway.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.720
Now it's happening,
I couldn't be happier.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.480
I'm not looking for anything serious.
I need to distance myself.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.800
I'm not gonna call you my girlfriend

05:37.880 --> 05:42.040
and I don't want it to get too much,
cos things are gonna change.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.320
Him saying that
makes me want him more.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.040
I want to know your postcode
and you won't tell us.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.080
If Zahida ever finds out my postcode,

05:51.160 --> 05:53.920
I'm gonna get witness protection
when I get out.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.520
You revealed last night
you live in Coventry.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.200
That narrows it down.
I'm moving, though.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.440
(laughs)

06:00.520 --> 06:02.120
I think he's a bit scared of us.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.040
The plan for us tonight is to get
him drunk and find where he lives.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.160
(laughs)

06:07.240 --> 06:09.320
What do you think's
gonna happen, like,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.560
when your exes come in, though?

06:11.640 --> 06:15.000
I'll take a step back from you.
As long as can sleep next to you.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.720
She's fucking nuts. She's a psycho.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.440
You might have to sleep
next to my ex-girlfriend as well.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.880
Fuck her.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.360
He's mine now.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.680
Sean's me new boyfriend.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.080
'Zahida looks like she's becoming
a thorn in Sean's side,

06:35.160 --> 06:38.640
but that will be the least of
his worries as the villa overgrows

06:38.720 --> 06:42.000
with exes coming for revenge.'

06:42.080 --> 06:44.480
'Whose ex is next?'

06:46.280 --> 06:47.480
No-one's cried...

06:47.560 --> 06:50.160
We're all just on a good...
No tears today.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.800
(tablet dings)

06:51.880 --> 06:54.440
Does that ever stop going off,
that little shit?

06:54.520 --> 06:56.800
Why don't you fuck off
Tablet of Terror?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.320
Hello, everyone,
now that you're all wet,

06:59.400 --> 07:00.920
it's an ideal time for a date.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.840
Alex and Alice, it's time for you
to talk it through by candlelight.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.120
Get in!
She looks happy.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.800
I hate him.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.960
Like, it's been playing on my mind,

07:24.040 --> 07:28.520
have you made a choice,
or had a thought about these two

07:28.600 --> 07:30.720
and what you're gonna do?

07:30.800 --> 07:33.600
I know that's...
But it's been on my mind.Wow.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.080
Made a choice?
I ain't a fucking choice.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.200
Shut up, you pleb. This ain't
got nothing to do with you.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.640
She's with Jack,
so let her get on with it.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.440
Like, I genuinely don't want
to talk about my situation. At all.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.880
No-one ask me any questions.
I'm so serious right now.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.720
I'm serious.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.440
So, do you just not know yourself?
Just leave her. Let her eat.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.560
Don't have a crack at me.
What are you two? Friends?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.640
Are you gonna be
rumping every night?

08:01.720 --> 08:04.520
There's other girls.
Other girls that could come in.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.760
Keeping your options firmly open?

08:06.840 --> 08:12.280
Sean is single. Do I give a fuck
if Zahida goes mental? No. I don't.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.000
Basically, can I crack on, or not?
Ooh.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.160
What did she say?

08:16.240 --> 08:18.520
Sean's a good looking guy,
I fancy...

08:18.600 --> 08:21.160
You still do. You fancy everyone.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.240
I'm sick of her trying
to steal Sean away from us.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.120
Get out me life, get out me face,
get off the Earth!

08:28.360 --> 08:30.240
That's how I feel about Maisie.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.280
Yeah, so shut your eyes.
Ooh. Ooh.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.200
I'm single. If I wanna
fancy another girl, I can.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.080
I've told Zahida from day one
that we're cracking on.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.760
What's the fucking problem?

08:44.720 --> 08:47.200
'With Alex hoping
to make amends with Alice,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.920
will he be able to find the words
to woo her back?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.720
You're a lovely girl,
you're not a slag.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.320
'I didn't think so.'

08:55.400 --> 08:57.960
I love who you are as a person,
how nice you are...

08:58.040 --> 09:00.560
Why's it taken you
three years to realise that?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.800
Is it because you love yourself
more than anyone else?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.360
Could be that.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.440
I can't take him seriously.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.360
You say such serious things, like,
"I love you", "I wanna marry you".

09:13.440 --> 09:16.640
I do.
But at the same time...

09:16.720 --> 09:19.880
...there's another girl
behind closed doors. In our bed!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.720
(laughs)

09:21.800 --> 09:23.440
I don't wanna be with you.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.960
How can a person...
You do.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.840
Point blank, I don't love you.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.640
Alex, right? Valentine's day,

09:29.720 --> 09:33.040
you asked a girl out, who I know,
for a date.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.640
I was in your bed.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.880
Do you know, right?
Like, I love her to pieces.

09:38.960 --> 09:43.240
You know, I'm not gonna lie,
every time I saw her I was ecstatic.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.440
He's horrible.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.480
You dunno what love is.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.360
You make me angry. I hate you.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.920
You're a horrible, horrible,
manipulative, controlling freak.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.200
Chill out, please.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.920
I'd rather date a rock than you,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.360
cos I've got more
to talk about with a rock.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.800
You're not like this.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.640
I am so done with Alex. So done.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.600
More food for me.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.680
Cheers.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.880
No arguments.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.520
(laughs)

10:27.960 --> 10:30.240
Never have I ever had a threesome.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.240
I'm fucking shit at this game,
I ain't done fuck all.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.000
Never have I ever faked an orgasm.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.080
Yep. Cheers girls!

10:39.160 --> 10:43.400
I shoot after five minutes anyway.
(laughs)

10:43.480 --> 10:44.680
I know a secret.

10:44.760 --> 10:48.400
Someone kissing behind the slide
today at the waterpark.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.440
And I love to get
that big wooden spoon out.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.160
Never have I ever
kissed anyone at a waterpark.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.840
(laughter)

11:00.920 --> 11:03.400
(laughs) This is awkward.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.240
Who've you kissed
at the waterpark then?

11:06.320 --> 11:09.200
Great question, Josh. Cheers.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.640
She's a bit of a bullshitter,
do you know what I mean?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.640
I am actually lost for words.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.200
They kissed at the water park?
I mean, what the hell is going on?

11:24.280 --> 11:27.680
Do you have any emotions about this?
Nah, mate. Sweet.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.880
It is what it is.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.160
Sweet, babe.
Yeah, don't worry. Crack on.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.280
So fucking awkward.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.080
It's no skin off my back.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.760
To be fair, I did say...
Listen, it's not skin off my back.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.760
It's very muggy what they done.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.120
I put trust in someone
and then they go and do that.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.560
Can I just say, it's not like we run
behind a fucking slide and snogged.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.160
It wasn't like that.
I was upset, he gave me hug

11:54.240 --> 11:56.960
and he looked at me
and I looked at him and we kissed.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.400
Jack. Ross. Jack. Ross.
You know what? Fuck it.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.080
All he's done is told me
that he cares about me.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.760
I could tell my fucking dog
that I care about it. It's bullshit.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.320
I need to get some action, cos it
feels like my bollocks are swelling.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.760
Come here, kid. Come here.

12:21.760 --> 12:25.360
(laughter)

12:25.440 --> 12:28.520
Fuck off, mate.
I don't want to shag you.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.440
Come here. Come on, gal.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.280
Come here, son.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.720
I tell you what,
she took that tongue well.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.840
I don't give a fuck, like, I like the
girl, but she can do what she wants.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.920
(laughter)

12:46.000 --> 12:48.840
Sean and Maisie pops up.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.040
Zahida's face drops.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.880
You couldn't have wrote this.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.760
Maisie's the only girl
who wants to sit on my dick.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.880
It's a game.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.640
Do you want a drink in your face?
I don't wanna look like a psycho.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.640
For God's sake, girl.
Keep your chill.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.000
(cheering, laughter)

13:29.920 --> 13:31.600
What you laughing at?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.680
Cos I'm not a psycho, maybe.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.320
You've not had a reason
to go psycho over anyone,

13:36.400 --> 13:40.120
cos you're fucking disgusting.
Inside and out.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.560
What the fuck
are you fucking laughing at?

13:42.640 --> 13:45.560
Who fucking cares
about your opinion?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.080
Grow the fuck up.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.640
Fuck off!

13:48.720 --> 13:51.240
I'm fucking sick of your shit.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.200
Maisie is fucking buzzing right now.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.400
I'm not gonna let that
last very long.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.840
I'm not gonna back down,
what the fuck am I?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.760
A virgin? No, I'm a fucking Geordie.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.520
That doesn't happen to us.
I don't fucking lose.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.840
Thank you, guys. Cheers to not being
a fucking psycho.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.480
Fuck off!

14:10.560 --> 14:13.480
I ain't into this shit.
I don't like aggressive girls.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.400
It's getting a bit much, isn't it?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.080
That's embarrassing, man.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.920
Fucking sick of that fucking cunt.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
You already had my ex, didn't you?

14:22.080 --> 14:25.480
See ya later. I fucking enjoyed it.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.920
I fucking enjoyed it.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.320
That is the one person who's been
bothering me in the house.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.080
I'm fucking livid!

14:34.160 --> 14:39.320
He's fucking got with Maisie
and Maisie got with my ex and...

14:39.400 --> 14:41.560
Fuck's sake.
I don't want to do this.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.400
I'm getting really wound up
about the situation.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.920
Fuck off!

14:48.000 --> 14:49.360
Calm your shit.
No!

14:49.440 --> 14:52.360
The way Zahida's acting
is absolutely out of order.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.320
You're being an idiot.
I don't care.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.320
Why are you so live?
I'm not, though.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.280
I'm embarrassed. I really am.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.680
I've proper had enough of Zahida
going off the hook.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.280
You're gone. Game over. Bye, bye.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.400
(crying)

15:08.480 --> 15:10.800
I don't give a fuck.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.040
Sean, if you think you can
end things with me now,

15:16.120 --> 15:19.160
you are very fucking wrong.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.560
After an unsuccessful date
to resolve their issues,

15:28.640 --> 15:31.000
Alex and Alice return to the villa.'

15:31.080 --> 15:34.000
'And there's only one question
on everyone's lips.'

15:34.080 --> 15:36.680
One question, did you cry?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.680
I didn't cry.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.440
(laughter, cheering)

15:41.520 --> 15:43.080
Stop being a fucking prick.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.160
I got really emotional
and ended up walking off.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.080
Do you think you could
ever love Alex again? No.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.400
You don't?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.160
You don't know?
No. Just no.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
I can't go through
what I went through.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.840
This kid's deluded.
Alice is there like, no chance, kid.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.480
What you gonna do
to try and win her back?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.440
Show that I don't wanna be a prick.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.720
There really isn't a chance at all.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.200
Are you single?
Yeah.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.200
But now I feel like, is there
any point in you being here?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.920
Yeah, cos I wanna get back with her.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.280
Well, that's fucking awkward.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.600
(laughs)

16:21.320 --> 16:24.880
I normally need a nervous poo,
but I think I need an awkward one.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.800
Fucking hell. Awkward!
(laughter)

16:29.760 --> 16:32.720
'Talking of feeling
like a number two...'

16:34.560 --> 16:39.440
I probably should have told Jack,
but I have no regrets kissing Ross.

16:41.080 --> 16:45.760
Ross gives me a hug, shows me
some affection and I feel happy.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.520
Everything between me
and Harriette is sweet now.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.120
She loves me.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.560
You may be smiling now, Ross, but
will that grin be wiped off your face

17:01.640 --> 17:04.480
when the next ex flies in to action?'

17:04.560 --> 17:07.800
'Expect the unexpected.'

17:13.160 --> 17:14.560
(tablet dings)

17:14.640 --> 17:18.079
(shouting)

17:18.160 --> 17:21.319
For fuck's sake, I hope my ex
don't come on that balcony.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.000
Shit.
Listen.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.680
'Hello, everyone.'

17:26.760 --> 17:29.840
'The villa is getting too full.'
(woman) Oh, God.

17:29.920 --> 17:35.080
'It's time to say goodbye to someone.
Josh, the choice is yours.'

17:35.160 --> 17:38.320
Oh, my fucking goodness.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.920
Pick wisely.
It's all right. I know it.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.200
Everyone's shitting themselves.
I'm gonna have a little think.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.240
Shit the fucking bed!

17:49.600 --> 17:54.160
Oh, this is horrible, man.
I really don't like it.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.760
If I'm honest...
Take a deep breathe and think.

17:57.840 --> 18:02.240
(tense music)

18:04.080 --> 18:06.840
Alex, bro, I'm gonna have to
send you home, mate.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.840
Why?
Just the table situation last night.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.000
She's right good-looking as well,
like you said.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.840
Oh, my God.
There's no need to get aggressive.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.400
Sorry, Alex, you have to go home.
Is that a little tear I see?

18:22.480 --> 18:23.720
Fuck off, mate.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.160
Fucking fuck.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.640
It's probably for the best.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.880
He brought this on.
I have no sympathy.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.080
Bye, babes. See you later.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.400
Do you want me to help you pack?
See you later, Alex.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.000
Everyone is well fucking glad
that Alex is going. Great decision.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.800
I used to be a massive geek, until
I got the sweet taste of vagina

18:58.880 --> 19:02.280
and every since then,
I've just been playing girls.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.400
All I wanna do
is talk to fucking Alice.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.080
What do you wanna say to her?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.600
Just tell her I'm sorry.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.480
You're being a great, big,
massive pussy.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.080
I can't wait to see her
and talk to her and chat.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.920
(shouting, cheering)

19:16.000 --> 19:18.360
I still love her.
Of course I love her.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.680
I wanna win her back.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.080
Please don't do this to me, babe.
Please.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.400
I just wanna be with you,
Alice, man, so bad.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.800
I don't wanna be with you.

19:33.880 --> 19:38.000
You're a horrible, horrible,
manipulative, controlling freak.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.680
I can't do it.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.560
I woke up this morning, looked to my
right and there's a little brunette.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.840
It's Harriette.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
But I need to clear the air,
find out where she's at,

20:03.080 --> 20:06.560
if she likes Jack, or she's got
feelings for me. I think it is me.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.920
Harriette's a bit like
a hotel, really.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.520
Ross is the guest there at the
minute, but I can get the keys.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.160
I can't help it with Jack.
There is history there.

20:19.240 --> 20:24.000
But I really like Ross and I'm ready
to tell him how I feel.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.640
Zahida's fucking crazy.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.000
She's lobbing glasses
and I can't be arsed.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.840
So, what I'm gonna do is take a step
back and put my intent elsewhere.

20:55.320 --> 21:00.280
Zaralena, dark hair, dark skin,
great body. My type.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.600
I want someone new in here
to have a bit of fun with.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.360
Just bring in another guy. Bring in
some more dick and let me have fun.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.880
'Careful what you wish for, Maisie,

21:13.960 --> 21:18.320
cos the next ex is around the corner
in T minus eight hours.'

21:19.560 --> 21:22.000
'Whose ex is next?'

21:27.640 --> 21:30.120
Maisie, do you wanna chat
before we eat?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.600
Come on then.

21:31.680 --> 21:35.160
The only reason I'm going to
apologise is to impress Sean.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.640
I don't actually mean it. I don't
give a fuck about her feelings.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.520
OK. I'll try and make this as short
as possible, cos I'm starving.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.800
But I just wanted to start by saying
I'm really, really, really sorry.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.520
Fuck me, she's actually apologising.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.480
I had some tension cos I heard
you still want to get with him.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.280
It's bothering us.
I'd never throw a punch at you.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.800
No, cos I'm, like,
five foot a fucking billion.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.680
You wouldn't be able
to reach my face.

22:04.760 --> 22:08.000
I can't really work out whether
Zahida's a broken girl

22:08.080 --> 22:09.520
and I should have sympathy,

22:09.600 --> 22:12.120
or whether she's mad
and brings it on herself.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.360
I'm swaying towards mad
to be honest.

22:14.440 --> 22:18.240
Do you know what I didn't like?
Erm, doing my thing with Sean.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.520
Please be respectful towards that.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.440
I hate her clothes, I hate
her shitty hair extensions,

22:23.520 --> 22:25.680
I hate her belly bar,
I hate her voice,

22:25.760 --> 22:28.840
I hate her accent,
I hate her massive long legs,

22:28.920 --> 22:30.520
I just hate her.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.680
'Ah, best friends.'

22:34.760 --> 22:35.840
Are you joking?

22:35.920 --> 22:39.360
'And it looks like Sean's
making friends of his own.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.200
Are coming on to me?

22:48.280 --> 22:50.360
Like I said, straight away...

22:51.360 --> 22:54.000
(laughs) Awkward as fuck.
But, it's like...

22:57.080 --> 23:00.600
I'm not quite sure what Zara thinks
of me telling her I fancy her.

23:03.720 --> 23:08.280
I genuinely do like him, but he's
already made roots with Zahida.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.280
I dunno, it's a hard one.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.360
Awkward. I'm gonna go and get a
juice on that awkward fucking note.

23:17.440 --> 23:21.600
I don't chase girls, but if Zara's
worth it, I might get a jog on.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.680
'The Tablet of Terror is being nice

23:25.760 --> 23:30.120
and it's sent Ross and Harriette on
a big, fat Greek dancing date.'

23:30.200 --> 23:33.160
Ross looks like Puss in Boots.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.480
What the fuck, mate?

23:35.560 --> 23:37.800
Yes!
Oh, my God.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.920
Amazing.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.520
Hello, guys.
Hiya.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.280
Hey, mate.
Welcome.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.200
What a lovely wedding dress.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.200
That's a wedding dress?
Er, yeah, yeah.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.280
Oh, my fucking God.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.160
(Greek dancing music)

23:59.760 --> 24:01.520
Enough of this Greek dancing.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.280
It's about time I showed 'em
how Essex girls do it.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.840
(club music)

24:06.920 --> 24:10.000
If she dances like that,
what is she gonna have sex like?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.240
Oh, there's that knife again.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.920
Ross is pretty shit at this,
to be honest.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.360
Go on!

24:16.440 --> 24:20.440
(cheers, laughs)

24:20.520 --> 24:23.280
That was a sick date.
Let's get a drink. I need a drink.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.680
I don't want that situation
to happen again.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.760
I wanna let her know how I feel
and see what she's saying.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.960
That one day where I wasn't
really with you, like,

24:32.040 --> 24:35.080
obviously I did miss being around
you and stuff like that.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.440
(giggles)

24:36.520 --> 24:39.720
Like, moving forward now,
I wanna be with you.

24:39.800 --> 24:44.120
I'm, like, 110% gonna be with you.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.360
I am massively falling for him.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.800
To be honest, if Jack kicks off
back at the villa, I don't care.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.800
Right, shall we go get married then?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.840
Now me and Harriette are together,
we need to go to the next level.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.360
I wanna see if I can get into her.
'Ah, romance.'

25:12.160 --> 25:14.920
I'd like to get to know you
and all of us a bit better,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.520
but we never see you,
cos you're so attached to Z.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.760
I ain't attached.
It's Z that's attached.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.440
That's a shock to me, bro.
Really? That is a shock.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.720
Sean's telling me he likes Zaralena,
is he looking for a death wish?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.400
You could try giving her a smooch.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.800
I'm not gonna try that.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.600
Listen,
I'm winding the bobbin up now.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.280
We'll see...
To be honest, that's shocked me,

25:50.360 --> 25:53.000
but do you know what?
My lips are sealed.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.480
Are you fucking sure?

25:56.160 --> 25:59.280
Zahida's gonna go fucking crazy
if she finds out

25:59.360 --> 26:02.720
what Sean's been saying
about cracking on with Zaralena.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.360
Look at the fucking state
of these two!

26:07.440 --> 26:09.920
(laughter, groans)

26:10.000 --> 26:13.840
Harriette and Ross walk in
from their little dancing date...

26:13.920 --> 26:17.640
Ross looks like a knock off
version of Jack Sparrow.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.360
(laughter)

26:19.440 --> 26:21.760
They look like a pair of prats
to be honest.

26:21.840 --> 26:27.000
Right, obviously, Harriette, you've
been confused about the situation,

26:27.080 --> 26:29.360
what's the full crack now?

26:29.440 --> 26:32.840
Yeah, so, we've just decided
that we're getting on really well

26:32.920 --> 26:35.600
and we're pretty serious
about each other, so...

26:35.680 --> 26:38.600
Right, do you want me
to go get my wedding hat?

26:38.680 --> 26:40.280
This is why we're dressed.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.560
Losing to Ross?

26:43.640 --> 26:48.280
It was like swallowing knives
when I heard them announce that.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.680
That's one to me, zero to Jack.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.760
'Not dressed like that, Ross.'

26:59.800 --> 27:01.320
(laughter)

27:04.640 --> 27:09.920
Basically, Harriette's
eyeballing me over the table.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.440
What does she want? She wants
my attention, let's be honest.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.680
It's hard having an ex in the villa.

27:19.760 --> 27:24.120
It's hard having them there staring
at you when you're cracking on.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.760
'Well, Harriette, expect it
to get a whole lot harder

27:27.840 --> 27:31.480
as a massive chopper is on its way.'

27:31.560 --> 27:33.560
The date went well,
we have champagne.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.000
So, everyone's had
a really good day.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.520
I can hear a little
chopping noise going round.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.680
(helicopter propellers)

27:42.760 --> 27:44.960
Oh, my God!

27:45.040 --> 27:47.800
Shit!
Is that a fucking helicopter?

27:50.120 --> 27:52.320
No.
It's turning.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.920
(talking over each other)

27:57.000 --> 27:59.520
What the fucking fuck?

27:59.600 --> 28:01.720
(talking over each other)

28:03.280 --> 28:07.840
(shouting, talking over each other)

28:07.920 --> 28:10.880
I am fucking nervous.
Who the hell is in that helicopter?

28:13.440 --> 28:15.360
Who's it gonna be?

28:15.440 --> 28:19.960
Shit. It's all of Sean's exes.
They're gonna grate my skin off.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.640
(shouting, screaming)

28:24.920 --> 28:26.200
For fuck's sake.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.520
(tense music)

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
Whose ex is fucking next?

28:38.920 --> 28:41.920
(tense music continues)

28:45.280 --> 28:47.000
I'm fucking sweating.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.760
Oh, my God.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.920
I'm Aaron from Newcastle. You might
recognise us from Geordie Shore.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.600
What I'm known for
is shagging and drinking.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.520
Most men dream about threesomes,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.880
but if I have anything less
than that, it's been a shit night.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.560
I had a foursome on Sunday, actually.

29:07.640 --> 29:11.360
I'm out to shag fit birds.
My loyalties lie right here.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.040
Me dick.

29:13.120 --> 29:16.800
Fuck knows what women love about me,
must be the blue eyes and tattoos.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.920
and my squeaky voice. (laughs)

29:24.080 --> 29:27.600
Finally, a fitty's in the villa.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.280
Hi, you all right?
You all right?

29:30.360 --> 29:33.640
This shit just got interesting!

29:33.720 --> 29:35.560
My fanny is gushing.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.520
Maisie, could you be
anymore desperate?

29:40.600 --> 29:43.360
I can smell you from here.
(retches)

29:43.440 --> 29:45.360
Hi, darling. You all right?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.680
I can see girls,
which is what I wanna see.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.040
And I'm just wondering
which one is my ex.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.880
Who's your ex?

30:08.560 --> 30:10.600
Me.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.960
Maisie's ex? I can crack on, then.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.440
I wasn't really an ex,
it was more of a bang, wasn't it?

30:17.840 --> 30:21.280
We are just a bang, but he's got
a massive cock. He's a great bang.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.440
This has to happen again.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.360
'Aaron's arrival seems to be causing
a storm amongst the girls.'

30:29.440 --> 30:30.920
'Particularly Maisie.'

30:31.000 --> 30:33.520
Fuck me, my fanny
is so fucking dripping.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.680
Aaron makes my fanny gush.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.680
Someone get a wet floor sign, cos I
tell you what, it is slippery here.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.640
I coughed and I basically pissed
out of my fanny hole.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.560
Stop it!
'Delightful.'

30:49.640 --> 30:52.520
'Let's hope Aaron's packed
his wellies.'

30:58.120 --> 30:59.680
Who wants a shot then?

31:00.880 --> 31:02.080
H?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.560
Want a shot, babe?

31:03.640 --> 31:06.880
Harriette's eyeballing me
over the bar.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.200
What the fuck is he all about?
Staring at me and giving me the eye?

31:15.280 --> 31:18.440
Go fuck off and play a game
with someone else. It's boring.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.120
You got one?

31:20.200 --> 31:24.480
We know she's with silly bollocks
cos I gave her no attention.

31:24.560 --> 31:28.800
I can have a little click
and she'll come running.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.640
'Oh, goody, it's question time
around the bar.'

31:36.720 --> 31:41.800
If you could share the penthouse
with anyone, who would it be?

31:41.880 --> 31:43.120
Yeah, you do.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.600
(laughter)

31:47.680 --> 31:50.040
(laughs) Fuck off.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.680
(laughter)

31:51.760 --> 31:54.240
Nicole's got a question.
Chuck it out there.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.200
Sean, who in this villa
do you fancy the most?

31:57.280 --> 32:01.080
(tense music)

32:02.440 --> 32:04.320
Like, I ain't getting involved,

32:04.400 --> 32:07.480
but me, Jack and Sean
was having a conversation earlier...

32:09.360 --> 32:10.720
My lips are sealed.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.160
...and Sean did say the person
he fancies in the house is Zara.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.920
Oops.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.320
Sean doesn't have his eye on me,
he has it for her,

32:22.400 --> 32:25.240
and now he's made us feel
second best.

32:29.040 --> 32:33.480
I feel guilty, but at the same time,
I tried to warn her.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
I've got my feelings for Zara.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.160
That was awkward.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.200
Zara!

32:43.280 --> 32:47.400
I've been getting mixed signals.
I wanna know what the crack is.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.400
Zara!

32:54.600 --> 32:58.360
I'm all for girl code. What the fuck
did he think was gonna happen?

33:07.400 --> 33:10.040
Sean's chucked straight
into the friend zone bin.

33:10.120 --> 33:14.760
Anyway, I fancy Aaron.
He's so fucking fit.

33:18.720 --> 33:23.240
'Jack and Ross have cosied up for
a man-to-man chat about Harriette.'

33:23.320 --> 33:25.480
I'll tell you now...

33:25.560 --> 33:27.480
I'll tell you now straight here.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.800
She's been eyeballing me
the whole time.

33:30.880 --> 33:35.040
She was eyeballing me
the whole time we was on the bar.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.720
That's a bit weird, isn't it?

33:36.800 --> 33:39.320
I'm just throwing
a couple of comments out there

33:39.400 --> 33:41.800
just trying to get
into his head a little bit.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.800
I dunno whether to trust Jack
or be wary of him.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.400
I won't beat around the bush, mate.
The thing is...

33:51.480 --> 33:52.560
As much...

33:57.120 --> 34:01.120
He has been pretty straight up, but
at the same time, he lost a bird.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.560
A lot of the girls are in here to
meet someone, have a relationship.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.400
I'm here to have some fun,
spread my legs and chill.

34:15.480 --> 34:19.760
I'll give you the fanny you want.
You want sex? I'm here for it.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.560
Let's be honest, we all know
Maisie wants to fuck me

34:22.639 --> 34:26.639
but I've got my eyes on one girl,
and that is Zaralena.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.719
Corner of my eye I can see Harriette
staring at me the whole night.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.719
Don't fucking start with me, mate.
That ain't fair.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.080
I'm not looking at him.
He's chatting shit and stirring.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.040
I got nothing to wind you up about.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.679
Bollocks, mate.

34:47.760 --> 34:51.480
Jack's saying she won't stop
looking at him, who do I believe?

34:51.560 --> 34:54.000
What's happened here?
I've missed loads.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.400
What's happened?

34:56.400 --> 34:57.800
Nothing.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.520
Jack doesn't get to me at all.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.520
I've not been thinking about him.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.040
He doesn't get to me whatsoever.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.360
I think Jack does get to Harriette
and she gets to Jack.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.800
Why don't you speak up?

35:12.880 --> 35:15.960
As if me and him have got
anything to talk about!

35:16.040 --> 35:19.120
I'm not gonna sit down and have
a chat about what's going on,

35:19.200 --> 35:21.040
cos there is nothing going on.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.440
Come on, mate, like, you fucking...
Oh, don't even start.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.200
Try and stir as much as you want.
How am I?

35:27.280 --> 35:31.480
I thought she was a decent bird
before I come in here.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.960
If you thought I was decent,
you wouldn't have fucked me about.

35:35.040 --> 35:41.040
If you thought I was a decent bird,
you wouldn't have fucked me about.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.400
I do like Harriette, but for some
reason she's acting crazy.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.760
Maybe cos she's got
feelings for Jack.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.560
Everyone's a fucking dickhead
in this house.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.480
'You might think that now,

35:51.560 --> 35:57.280
but there's plenty more dickheads
on their way to mess with your mind.'

35:57.360 --> 36:00.200
'Whose ex is next?'

36:06.000 --> 36:08.480
I don't get why
you'd let it bother you.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.040
Why you making out
that I'm some pathetic bird?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.960
That I'm getting in rows with my ex?

36:13.040 --> 36:16.560
I promised you the whole way
through, if my ex comes in,

36:16.640 --> 36:20.400
nothing would change, but you're
still getting in rows with yours.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.720
She knows how I feel, I know
how she feels. Let it go.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.920
I'm not getting stuck
in this triangle.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.040
He's been trying to stir shit,

36:32.120 --> 36:35.440
cos he's a very fucking clever guy.
Don't rise to it.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.320
No triangle. I'm done.
Me and Ross are cracking on.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.840
We're getting to know each other,
we're happy.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.640
'Yeah, you're really happy.'

36:44.720 --> 36:48.400
'Let's see if Maisie's still
playing hard to get?'

36:48.480 --> 36:51.440
He's got my fanny on tap,
so if he wants it, he can have it.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.680
(laughter)

36:52.760 --> 36:56.600
Tap fanny. On. Off. On.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.520
(laughs) You're a fucking...

36:58.600 --> 37:01.240
(Tablet of Terror dings)
Oh, for fuck's sake.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.000
Tablet of Terror, let's be honest
is a little shit.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.640
"Hello, Aaron. Hope you're having
a nice first night."

37:07.720 --> 37:11.840
"You've had one ride tonight, will
you be lucky enough to get another?"

37:11.920 --> 37:13.640
Yes!

37:15.200 --> 37:18.640
"You and Zaralena
may have the penthouse tonight

37:18.720 --> 37:21.120
to get to know each other
a little bit better."

37:21.200 --> 37:22.240
That's fine. Good.

37:22.320 --> 37:26.320
I've shaved my fucking fanny.
What a fucking waste.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.800
What a fucking waste.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.120
Do you want it?
Yeah.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.440
Not got to know you yet.
Thanks, Tablet of Terror.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.800
What's people saying?
You think she'll put out?Nah.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.080
Cheers. Welcome to the villa.
To the first night.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.600
I hope Aaron's got strength
in his wrists,

37:46.680 --> 37:50.280
cos he's gonna be tugging off on his
own while she's fallen asleep.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.480
(champagne cork pops)

37:55.200 --> 37:57.280
'Sean's put himself to bed alone.'

37:57.360 --> 37:59.720
'Well, that's what he thinks.'

37:59.800 --> 38:03.120
No-one, and I fucking mean no-one,

38:03.200 --> 38:05.640
is getting in the way
of what I fucking want.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.880
And what I fucking want is Sean.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.240
'Zaralena's getting to know
Aaron better.'

38:18.320 --> 38:19.840
Wow.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.320
'With Maisie waiting in the wings.'

38:23.400 --> 38:24.800
'Just in case.'

38:27.680 --> 38:30.440
'And Ross and Harriette
finally bed down together.'

38:30.520 --> 38:33.760
'Under the watchful eye
of Jack, of course.'
