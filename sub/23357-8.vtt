00:03.286 --> 00:05.721
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

00:10.225 --> 00:12.703
LANE: Costs us about $2,200

00:12.739 --> 00:16.364
per bed a day just to
keep Chastain open.

00:16.399 --> 00:19.272
Now, that's roughly $160 million a year.

00:19.308 --> 00:21.599
GORDON: Have-have you ever experienced
the Serengeti, Randolph?

00:21.635 --> 00:24.159
No, Gordon, but much more rewarding

00:24.195 --> 00:25.627
than waiting for the rains in Africa

00:25.663 --> 00:27.327
might be to help us make it rain here.

00:27.363 --> 00:29.864
Mm-hmm, like funding
your new surgical center?

00:30.112 --> 00:32.680
Well, in order to keep
brilliant, young surgeons

00:32.715 --> 00:34.594
like Dr. Okafor here happy,
we need the...

00:34.630 --> 00:37.430
Is that why you were invited
here tonight, Dr. Okafor?

00:37.466 --> 00:39.566
To, um, help persuade us?

00:39.602 --> 00:43.574
I was invited because I'm black.
Apparently diversity matters.

00:47.856 --> 00:49.778
Ah, look at poor Mina.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.065
I wish we could throw her a lifeline.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.301
Why don't you go down there?
Help her out?

00:55.153 --> 00:56.770
I'll go if you go.

00:57.444 --> 00:59.273
I'd rather have a colonoscopy.

00:59.308 --> 01:00.644
(both laughing)

01:03.320 --> 01:07.149
They're in my ear. Can you...
Can you get them out?

01:08.322 --> 01:10.218
CONRAD: All right,
let's get back to work.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.107
Wait.

01:12.487 --> 01:13.588
Please.

01:13.623 --> 01:14.939
It hurts.

01:15.243 --> 01:18.080
Can you get them out? It hurts. Please?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.316
Too loud. They're-they're in my ear.

01:24.766 --> 01:26.767
Please, can you help me get them out?

01:26.802 --> 01:28.736
Oh, is that right? Yes, that's... Yeah.

01:28.771 --> 01:30.079
They're in my head. Get them out.

01:30.115 --> 01:31.037
Excuse me.

01:31.073 --> 01:32.575
They're in my ear. Get 'em out.

01:37.813 --> 01:39.279
(guests exclaiming)

01:39.314 --> 01:41.415
- Excuse me.

(guests murmuring)

01:48.099 --> 01:50.067
How did she get in here?

01:53.627 --> 01:55.631
She's got a pulse, it's very slow.

01:56.053 --> 01:57.419
Pupils are equal and reactive.

01:57.455 --> 02:00.432
Scattered rhonchi,
but she's moving good air.

02:00.468 --> 02:03.437
Okay, everybody, just step back,
step back, please.

02:03.472 --> 02:05.005
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.340
Let's just give these doctors
some room to work.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.109
I need a C-collar and backboard now.

02:08.144 --> 02:11.611
Okay, well, let's get this-this
poor soul to our ER, and, uh,

02:11.646 --> 02:14.348
just keep me posted on how she's doing.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.317
It's okay.

02:17.209 --> 02:18.855
She'll be all right.

03:00.062 --> 03:01.675
Collapsed from syncopal episode

03:01.711 --> 03:03.712
with blunt head trauma,
multiple abrasions,

03:03.748 --> 03:05.015
and a forehead laceration.

- Not seeing an I.D.

- Trauma panel, EKG,

- chest X-ray and head CT.
- I'll take care of the lac.

03:13.376 --> 03:15.632

- Channing Brewster, 25-year-old male.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.559
Ran through a glass door.
Facial lacerations,

03:32.594 --> 03:34.027
multiple small cuts
to his arms and torso,

03:34.062 --> 03:35.396
shards of glass in his left eye.

03:35.431 --> 03:37.031
Two episodes of vomiting en route.

03:37.067 --> 03:40.101
- I can't see out of this eye.
- Okay, easy, Mr. Brewster.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.971
I'm Dr. Feldman,
I'll be taking care of you.

03:42.007 --> 03:43.704
I just want to take a look
at your eye, okay?

03:43.739 --> 03:45.611
- Okay.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

03:45.647 --> 03:47.984
Let's transfer him
and prepare to irrigate.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.546
Micah, hey. Sorry we had
to change your echo to tonight.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.216
It's been crazy around here.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.722
Yeah, I noticed. I was rerouted
from the front entrance.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.224
How's the new ticker?

03:59.260 --> 04:00.694
That's what I'm here to find out.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.029
MINA: Admit him to the floor

04:02.065 --> 04:04.699
on antibiotics and we'll
take him to the OR tomorrow.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.514
NURSE: Mm-hmm. Right away.

04:07.305 --> 04:10.138
Wow, Dr. Okafor, I almost

04:10.298 --> 04:11.899
didn't recognize you
all supermodeled up.

04:11.934 --> 04:15.436
(chuckles)
In for your 1,000-mile checkup?

04:15.471 --> 04:17.404
A patient who actually follows up.

04:17.439 --> 04:18.839
Yeah.

04:21.677 --> 04:23.721
I will leave you two to it.

04:25.331 --> 04:28.114
I hear your heart donor's family
wants to meet you.

04:28.777 --> 04:30.917
They reached out through
the recovery program.

04:30.952 --> 04:32.753
Just not sure I'm ready for that yet.

04:32.788 --> 04:35.153
So don't meet them. It's your heart now.

04:40.844 --> 04:43.330
No, actually, we'd like to keep
the guest list to 150.

04:43.365 --> 04:44.765
Nonsense.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.467
So few? That would
barely cover my cousins.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.284
Well, it's important

04:49.320 --> 04:52.440
to us that we pay for half the wedding,

04:52.475 --> 04:54.113
- so we need to stick to our number.
- Yes.

04:54.149 --> 04:56.943
But the groom's family
can also contribute,

04:56.979 --> 04:58.946
- not just the bride's.
- Of course.

04:59.123 --> 05:01.614
We can pay for more than just
flowers and the <i>mithai.</i>

05:01.649 --> 05:02.782
DEVON: It's okay.

05:02.817 --> 05:05.896
Like I said, we got it covered.

05:06.189 --> 05:09.860
Besides, we want to keep it
small and intimate.

05:14.092 --> 05:15.869
Let's talk about something else.

05:19.107 --> 05:23.792
So, uh, Priya, your father
is a barrister in London, yes?

05:23.828 --> 05:25.062
That's right.

05:25.161 --> 05:26.826
TEJAN: How does he feel
about you marrying

05:26.862 --> 05:28.030
the son of a taxi driver?

05:28.066 --> 05:30.805
- Tejan.
- My parents are very fond

05:30.841 --> 05:33.018
of your son, Mr. Pravesh.

05:33.473 --> 05:35.894
They don't discuss things
like this in their family.

05:37.596 --> 05:41.522
Well, judgments get passed in silence.

05:41.857 --> 05:43.526
Your occupation has never come up.

05:43.746 --> 05:48.049
And it is my decision
who I marry, not my father's.

05:50.565 --> 05:53.902
(cell phone chiming)

05:54.854 --> 05:56.663
_

05:56.699 --> 05:58.046
Uh...

05:58.082 --> 06:00.850
- And the check, sir.
- I have to get back.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.981
HIMAYA: Do you have to leave now?

06:03.515 --> 06:05.852
The hospital is short-staffed
and they need me.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.851
No more questions, Dad, and...
We got it.

06:09.887 --> 06:11.124
Let me.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.636
We discussed this.

06:15.348 --> 06:16.605
It's okay.

06:24.115 --> 06:27.317
Her head CT and drug and alcohol
screen came back normal.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.195
Thinking she's altered from
an underlying psych disorder.

06:30.231 --> 06:31.864
We need a medical reason to admit her.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.593
She does have an area
of pneumonia on her X-ray.

06:33.629 --> 06:35.395
Plus the ear infection,
but, technically,

06:35.431 --> 06:37.398
we should just discharge her
on oral antibiotics for that.

06:37.434 --> 06:38.632
Yeah, no, we can't do that.
That's not right.

06:38.668 --> 06:41.064
Yeah, I know. Well, admitting
her, I'm just trying to...

06:44.586 --> 06:46.719
I remember her saying
she felt severe chest pain

06:46.754 --> 06:48.793
before she collapsed, don't you?

06:49.757 --> 06:51.660
That'll buy her an admission.

06:51.814 --> 06:54.649
I mean, I'm not sure it's
gonna fly with admin, but...

06:54.685 --> 06:57.298
Yeah, too bad. We're out of options.

07:01.470 --> 07:02.736
These drops will sting

07:02.771 --> 07:04.572
for a few seconds
but then numb the pain.

07:04.607 --> 07:05.924
- Okay.
- Look down.

07:06.442 --> 07:08.241
CHANNING: (inhales sharply) Ow.

07:08.276 --> 07:10.144
- Blink. Good.
- Yeah. Thanks.

07:10.446 --> 07:12.979
We'll try irrigating,
and if this doesn't work,

07:13.014 --> 07:15.142
then we'll pull those
little suckers one at a time.

07:15.178 --> 07:16.477
Look down.

07:16.985 --> 07:19.419
Wh-What about the face?

07:19.454 --> 07:22.755
I mean, is it gnarly?
Do I need stitches?

07:22.790 --> 07:24.959
That's a no to the gnarly
and the stitches.

07:24.994 --> 07:26.279
You got lucky.

07:26.907 --> 07:29.240
How in the world did you
run through a glass door?

07:29.564 --> 07:31.240
Occupational hazard.

07:31.806 --> 07:33.790
I was trying to get away
from my client's husband.

07:33.981 --> 07:37.187
Oh, yeah? You, like,
a private eye? Divorce lawyer?

07:37.513 --> 07:39.858
No. Although, in my line of work,

07:39.894 --> 07:41.308
I definitely run into both.

07:41.343 --> 07:42.775
Uh...

07:42.810 --> 07:45.179
I'm in the, um, service business.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.384
Oh. Oh!

07:48.725 --> 07:50.360
(whispering): You're a gigolo?

07:50.396 --> 07:52.627
Well, we prefer "male escort."

07:54.689 --> 07:55.826
Huh.

08:02.097 --> 08:05.058
Pretty. So pretty.

08:09.217 --> 08:12.243
The painting. Yeah, it is pretty.

08:13.609 --> 08:15.177
Here.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.703
Were you at another hospital?

08:23.739 --> 08:24.839
Huh?

08:27.055 --> 08:29.391
Did you come from another hospital?

08:32.395 --> 08:34.230
I'm gonna get you something
to eat. I'll be back, all right?

08:38.705 --> 08:41.307
I think our Jane Doe was
dropped off by another hospital.

08:41.342 --> 08:42.669
Hospitals dumping homeless patients

08:42.705 --> 08:44.730
not only pisses me off, it's illegal.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.798
We sure she didn't elope on her own?

08:46.834 --> 08:48.203
It's not likely.

08:48.269 --> 08:50.979
I know exactly what hospital
this EKG lead comes from.

08:52.944 --> 08:54.821
They've done it before, Conrad.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.558
A little overdressed for work.

09:02.593 --> 09:04.192
I was at dinner.

09:04.227 --> 09:05.660
I'd say I'm sorry for
interrupting date night,

09:05.695 --> 09:06.995
but I'd be lying.

09:07.030 --> 09:08.364
It wasn't a date as much as it was

09:08.399 --> 09:10.165
an interrogation by my father.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.000
You got me confused
with someone who cares.

09:12.035 --> 09:14.569
I need you to head down to
the ER. Irving's short-handed.

09:14.604 --> 09:16.589
Needs help with the gigolo.

09:17.485 --> 09:18.546
Wait.

09:18.582 --> 09:20.082
Did you say "gigolo"?

09:20.118 --> 09:21.711
It's really about the little details.

09:21.746 --> 09:24.713
Personal touches
in every patient's room.

09:24.748 --> 09:26.674
Personal menus.

09:26.710 --> 09:30.823
We also keep a full-on staff of nurses,

09:31.588 --> 09:34.277
make sure everyone
has that one-on-one feeling...

09:34.313 --> 09:36.091
Why was this woman admitted?

09:36.884 --> 09:39.521
Just following through
on your promise to the donors

09:39.557 --> 09:41.090
that we'd get her the best care
in the city.

09:41.126 --> 09:42.962
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.735
Randolph, is everything all right?

09:45.770 --> 09:48.178
Yup. Everything's fine.
Be with you in one second.

09:49.469 --> 09:51.046
We don't know what's wrong
with our Jane Doe.

09:51.082 --> 09:52.883
We had to admit her to run more tests.

09:52.919 --> 09:54.316
And before you ask,

09:54.352 --> 09:56.084
she tested negative
for any drugs or alcohol.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.994
Okay, wouldn't she be more
comfortable in the psych ward

09:58.030 --> 09:59.316
on an involuntary hold?

09:59.352 --> 10:00.616
Trent from Psych already examined her.

10:00.652 --> 10:01.918
He doesn't think she's mentally ill.

10:01.954 --> 10:03.140
That's why we're doing more tests.

10:03.176 --> 10:05.063
We're not running a charity here.

10:05.558 --> 10:08.455
Well, you're the Chief of Surgery.
You know it's not your call.

10:08.491 --> 10:11.126
I'm the highest-ranking member of
the board currently on the premises.

10:11.161 --> 10:13.456
And it sure as hell
isn't a resident's call.

10:13.492 --> 10:15.581
Treat her for the bare minimum
and street her.

10:15.617 --> 10:17.650
That makes us no better
than Atlanta General.

10:17.833 --> 10:18.932
Atlanta General?

10:19.138 --> 10:20.752
This lead goes with a new

10:20.788 --> 10:23.256
all-digital EKG machine from Cardiosure.

10:23.292 --> 10:24.758
Atlanta General
has the only one in town.

10:24.794 --> 10:26.141
I've been trying to get one
here for months.

10:26.176 --> 10:28.577
Yeah, but, Nic, we got
that fancy cappuccino machine

10:28.612 --> 10:30.938
- up in the VIP wing.
- Just call Atlanta General

10:30.974 --> 10:33.770
and tell them to come
and pick up their problem.

10:33.806 --> 10:35.335
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

10:37.906 --> 10:40.561
Well, you know, I just,
I forget who I'm talking to.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.103
I'll do it.

10:42.139 --> 10:43.659
How are you gonna get
Atlanta General to do anything?

10:43.694 --> 10:45.126
No, it's simple. We just call them,

10:45.161 --> 10:46.761
tell them to come pick up
their responsibility,

10:46.796 --> 10:49.259
unless they want to be the
lead story on the 10:00 news.

10:49.381 --> 10:51.982
"Atlanta General unwilling
to treat homeless patients,

10:52.018 --> 10:54.635
- now dumps them on Chastain's door."
- All right.

10:57.751 --> 10:59.922
They're just going to dump her
on the street again.

11:00.157 --> 11:01.977
- LANE: Uh, the one-on-one...
- We can't let that happen.

11:02.012 --> 11:05.716
...very important to us
that patients feel comfortable.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:20.874 --> 11:22.939
DEVON: Nice, nicely done.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.977
Sorry, it wasn't my idea
to call you back.

11:26.013 --> 11:27.045
It was Conrad's.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.803
It's okay, he did me a favor.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.872
Not that Priya was thrilled.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.881
Your parents and your fiancée
don't get along?

11:32.917 --> 11:34.384
DEVON: No, no, no. Priya loves them.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.178
It's just my old man
who's got the issues.

11:36.213 --> 11:37.980
He gets all squirrely and weird

11:38.015 --> 11:40.149
when it comes to his money and pride.

11:40.184 --> 11:42.832
Has a lot to do with how
he was brought up in India.

11:43.253 --> 11:46.521
Great. So, how's the pain?

11:46.556 --> 11:47.856
It's, uh, great.

11:47.891 --> 11:49.859
As in, I don't feel any. (chuckles)

11:50.289 --> 11:52.327
It sounds like your dad's all
caught up in the caste system.

11:52.362 --> 11:53.663
Is your fiancée in a different caste?

11:53.698 --> 11:55.492
Is that the-the problem?

11:55.925 --> 11:57.725
What do you know about
the Indian caste system?

11:57.761 --> 11:59.201
CHANNING: It's a paradigmatic,
ethnographic

11:59.236 --> 12:00.903
social stratification

12:00.938 --> 12:02.237
that determines the behavior

12:02.272 --> 12:04.340
of one member of society over another.

12:04.736 --> 12:07.510
I was an International Studies
major. Yeah.

12:08.254 --> 12:10.999
I took a special interest
in Southeast Asia.

12:11.035 --> 12:13.848
The whole caste system thing,
it's archaic.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.585
So, uh, the whole,
uh, male escort thing,

12:15.620 --> 12:17.053
is that to pay off student loans?

12:17.088 --> 12:18.670
CHANNING: I don't carry student loans.

12:18.706 --> 12:20.356
Job pays well.

12:20.894 --> 12:23.887
I mean, that could change if I
end up looking like Leatherface.

12:23.923 --> 12:26.028
Nah. Battle wounds.

12:26.063 --> 12:27.263
Gives you character.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.861
Mm, the news is good, Micah.

12:30.897 --> 12:33.879
No sign of rejection,
your EF's up to 54%.

12:33.915 --> 12:35.548
The valves are functioning well,

12:35.584 --> 12:38.240
limited view of the aortic root
from shadowing,

12:38.275 --> 12:40.255
but, overall, everything looks good.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.257
I knew that. Wasn't worried at all.

12:42.293 --> 12:43.578
(both laugh)

12:44.837 --> 12:46.881
Oh, you're laughing.
That's always a good sign.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.884
We're all done here, Micah.

12:48.919 --> 12:50.994
I'm going to leave you
in Nurse Nevin's capable hands.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.496
- See you next month.
- All right.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.076
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

12:54.112 --> 12:56.303
That has to be a huge relief.
Let's get you out of here.

12:56.339 --> 12:59.189
You know, actually, my surgical scar's
been a little irritated.

12:59.225 --> 13:00.657
I'm worried it's not healing properly.

13:00.808 --> 13:02.765
Oh. Looks okay,
but better safe than sorry,

13:02.801 --> 13:04.735
- I'll see if Dr. Peterson can come back.
- It's okay.

13:04.771 --> 13:06.806
Can Dr. Okafor check it out?

13:06.974 --> 13:09.316
I mean, since she's here

13:09.352 --> 13:11.240
and she was on my surgical team...

13:11.275 --> 13:13.442
- (chuckles)
- (code alarm blaring)

13:14.292 --> 13:16.779
I got to go, but I'll see
if she's available.

13:16.814 --> 13:18.031
Okay.

13:20.955 --> 13:23.089
- What happened?
- CONRAD: Found her hypotensive

13:23.125 --> 13:25.920
and coughing up large clots.
Sats are dropping.

13:25.955 --> 13:27.088
I think it's her lungs.

13:27.123 --> 13:28.658
We need pulmonary. Page Dr. Hoffman.

13:28.693 --> 13:31.039
And activate massive transfusion
protocol with the blood bank.

13:31.075 --> 13:32.377
Paging Dr. Hoffman.

13:34.298 --> 13:36.808
Dr. Hoffman's in the middle
of an ER bronch.

13:36.844 --> 13:38.751
It says he'll be here
in 15 to 20 minutes.

13:38.787 --> 13:40.269
She'll drown in her own blood in ten.

13:41.426 --> 13:43.090
Then I'll intubate her myself.

13:45.486 --> 13:47.086
Infiltrate's on the left,

13:47.122 --> 13:48.456
that's probably what's causing
the bleeding.

13:49.216 --> 13:50.851
Hurry, her sats are dropping.

13:54.748 --> 13:56.331
Airway's filled with blood.

13:56.367 --> 13:57.748
I need to intubate just the right lung.

13:57.784 --> 13:59.553
Sats are down to 74%.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.977
(Conrad grunts)

14:06.762 --> 14:08.465
Okay, through the cords.

14:11.134 --> 14:13.037
Rotating 90 degrees.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.345
Hoping I can block the bleeding
from the left

14:20.381 --> 14:21.583
and still ventilate her.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.890
No breath sounds on the left.

14:35.727 --> 14:37.362
Blow up the balloon.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.061
NIC: Sats are coming back up.

14:45.097 --> 14:46.465
This is just a Band-Aid.

14:46.501 --> 14:47.694
Page Mina.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.538
She needs a bronchoscopy right away.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.395
ISABEL: Paging Dr. Okafor.

14:58.686 --> 15:00.850
Bleeding has stopped.
The cautery worked.

15:00.885 --> 15:03.393
Let me get a tissue sample
for biopsy while I'm here.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.703
ISABEL: So, this is where the lesion

15:07.739 --> 15:10.649
eroded the bronchus,
causing her to hemorrhage?

15:13.054 --> 15:14.665
Doesn't look like pneumonia.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.877
It can be any number of things,

15:17.202 --> 15:19.203
including cancer. Got the sample.

15:19.238 --> 15:21.056
CONRAD: We need to start
narrowing down the differential.

15:21.092 --> 15:22.573
Get her to imaging for a CT

15:22.608 --> 15:24.078
and send the biopsy off to the lab.

15:24.114 --> 15:25.651
That's expensive.

15:26.211 --> 15:28.179
Since when do you care
about the cost of tests?

15:28.214 --> 15:30.513
Not tests. This bag.

15:31.338 --> 15:34.268
This is an Xavier Mellino original.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.887
It's worth $148,000.

15:36.922 --> 15:38.388
What... How do you know that?

15:38.423 --> 15:41.025
I know stitching.
Probably found it in a Dumpster

15:41.060 --> 15:42.526
or snatched it from the owner.

15:42.561 --> 15:44.561
CONRAD: Nic already looked
for an I.D. in there.

15:44.596 --> 15:46.763
One-of-a-kinds like this usually
have the owner's name

15:46.798 --> 15:48.567
inscribed on the inside.

15:54.139 --> 15:55.539
Sara Ravenscroft.

15:55.574 --> 15:57.407
Her name even sounds rich.

15:57.442 --> 15:59.109
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear

15:59.144 --> 16:00.740
that we found her $100 grand purse.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.915
Maybe there's a reward.

16:02.951 --> 16:04.086
Maybe.

16:08.590 --> 16:10.054
Or maybe...

16:10.089 --> 16:12.565
our Jane Doe is Sara Ravenscroft.

16:13.658 --> 16:15.593
<i>She's the daughter</i>

16:15.628 --> 16:17.460
of Lawrence and Veronica Ravenscroft.

16:17.902 --> 16:20.037
They're wealthy philanthropists
out of Savannah.

16:20.073 --> 16:21.431
How does the daughter of one of the most

16:21.466 --> 16:22.900
prominent families in Georgia

16:22.935 --> 16:24.635
end up sick and living on the street?

16:24.670 --> 16:26.303
According to one of the
Savannah gossip blogs,

16:26.338 --> 16:28.238
Sara is estranged from her family.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.709
She left town a couple months
ago to become an artist.

16:30.745 --> 16:32.309
- Is she out of imaging yet?
- (pager beeping)

16:32.344 --> 16:33.978
Was just about to check.

16:34.013 --> 16:35.945
You get that, I'll check on Sara.

16:35.980 --> 16:37.634
Mina, you've got something
else to deal with.

16:37.670 --> 16:38.758
CONRAD: What?

16:38.794 --> 16:40.251
Pressing surgery?

16:40.286 --> 16:41.785
A certain lovesick transplantee

16:41.820 --> 16:43.786
has something wrong with his scar.

16:43.821 --> 16:46.623
This is a waste of my time.
You know his scar is fine.

16:46.658 --> 16:48.491
Mina, you know Micah
has feelings for you.

16:48.526 --> 16:50.294
If you want them to go away,
you've got to deal with them.

16:50.329 --> 16:51.629
CONRAD: Be gentle.

16:51.664 --> 16:53.264
The poor guy just got a brand-new heart.

16:53.496 --> 16:55.233
I'm always gentle.

16:56.005 --> 16:57.771
A little swelling is normal.

16:58.368 --> 17:01.454
I'll prescribe some vitamin E ointment
to help with the healing.

17:03.929 --> 17:05.944
I wasn't really worried about my scar.

17:07.018 --> 17:08.502
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone

17:08.539 --> 17:10.013
- what I actually wanted to discuss.
- Look, Micah...

17:10.049 --> 17:12.016
It's-it's my heart donor.
Turns out he was a convicted

17:12.050 --> 17:14.243
car thief who was let out on parole.

17:14.329 --> 17:17.060
- You have a felon's heart?
- Ironic, right?

17:17.096 --> 17:19.020
Me, a minister's son.

17:19.261 --> 17:20.773
Anyway, I went online, right?

17:20.810 --> 17:22.625
And there's this thing
called cellular memory,

17:22.660 --> 17:24.295
where the person who
receives a donor organ

17:24.329 --> 17:26.296
sometimes takes on the
characteristics of the donor.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.966
- You know, like their taste in music and food...
- (laughs)

17:29.001 --> 17:30.467
No, I'm serious.
Look, what if I develop a taste

17:30.502 --> 17:32.468
for aggravated assault or armed robbery?

17:32.503 --> 17:34.610
Okay, calm down, Idi Amin.

17:35.073 --> 17:37.208
I'm sure there are studies
from reputable medical journals

17:37.243 --> 17:38.842
to dispute this nonsense.

17:38.877 --> 17:40.477
I will look into it and
get back to you tomorrow.

17:40.512 --> 17:42.813
Why not tonight? I'm stressed.

17:42.848 --> 17:44.648
- That could be bad for my health.
- My shift is...

17:44.683 --> 17:45.838
I can wait until you're done.

17:46.851 --> 17:48.888
Maybe we can discuss it
over a cup of coffee.

17:51.999 --> 17:54.299
(sighs) Fine.

17:54.738 --> 17:57.597
One cup, black, to go.

18:02.754 --> 18:05.169
So how long till
I can see out of this eye?

18:05.204 --> 18:07.571
Depends on how quickly
the swelling goes down,

18:07.606 --> 18:09.206
but I'm optimistic.

18:09.241 --> 18:11.154
The injuries seem superficial.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.833
I've paged an ophthalmologist
to take a second look.

18:13.869 --> 18:16.080
And once he gives you
the okay, you can go.

18:16.115 --> 18:18.885
- (cell phone buzzing)
- Hmm.

18:20.646 --> 18:25.386
Uh, so your fiancée, is she
Kshatriya or Vaishya?

18:28.627 --> 18:32.495
She's, um, she's Kshatriya.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.102
And, uh, your parents, they-they
immigrated here, right?

18:35.138 --> 18:36.938
Uh, what's your dad do?

18:37.235 --> 18:38.901
He owns a medallion cab
in Queens, and I'm done

18:38.936 --> 18:41.104
- talking about this.
- So you are the successful son

18:41.139 --> 18:43.239
of an honest, working-class family.

18:43.274 --> 18:45.374
I'm guessing your family is Vaishya.

18:45.811 --> 18:48.879
As a gigolo, shouldn't you be
a man of action, not words?

18:48.914 --> 18:51.081
Okay. First, male escort.

18:51.116 --> 18:53.712
Second, m-most of my clients
just want to talk.

18:53.748 --> 18:54.857
Look here.

18:54.893 --> 18:57.120
So your fiancée's in the higher caste,

18:57.156 --> 18:58.889
- which probably makes your dad feel insecure.
- (sighs)

18:59.236 --> 19:01.103
Or is it her family that has issues?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.922
Our families haven't even met.

19:04.757 --> 19:07.230
You're not gonna wait for them
to meet at the wedding, are you?

19:07.265 --> 19:09.565
- (cell phone buzzing)
- Ah.

19:10.056 --> 19:11.926
You got to be kidding me.

19:17.176 --> 19:18.774
What are you guys doing here?

19:19.344 --> 19:20.611
Where's-where's Priya?

19:20.646 --> 19:22.246
She dropped us at the hotel.

19:22.281 --> 19:24.414
HIMAYA: Our flight leaves early
tomorrow morning.

19:24.449 --> 19:26.949
We were worried that we wouldn't
get a chance to say good-bye.

19:26.984 --> 19:29.085
TEJAN: We barely got
to see you this trip,

19:29.120 --> 19:30.453
so we took a cab over here.

19:30.488 --> 19:32.655
Pleasant driver from Belize. Nice car.

19:32.690 --> 19:34.424
- Little too chatty.
- (Himaya chuckles)

19:34.621 --> 19:36.755
We know you're busy, we'll just sit.

19:36.791 --> 19:39.763
And whenever you get a coffee
break, you just come and visit.

19:39.798 --> 19:41.265
Is there a gift shop?
Maybe I'll get a book.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.766
The gift shop is closed and we don't,

19:42.801 --> 19:44.518
we don't have coffee breaks.

19:45.306 --> 19:48.671
Honey, we haven't seen you in months.

19:48.706 --> 19:51.475
Just watching you work makes me happy.

19:51.510 --> 19:52.942
You can't watch me work, Mom.

19:52.977 --> 19:54.644
There are rules about these things.

19:54.679 --> 19:56.279
We'll grab a bite and wait, then.

19:56.314 --> 20:00.519
The cafe is closed, Dad.
The gift shop is closed.

20:00.555 --> 20:02.619
Everything is closed
but the saving-lives part

20:02.654 --> 20:04.142
of this building, okay?

20:06.358 --> 20:07.957
You should have called first.

20:08.902 --> 20:10.827
Do you not want us to be here?

20:10.862 --> 20:12.462
Do you not want us
meeting your colleagues?

20:12.497 --> 20:16.535
What? No. Okay, that-that's ridiculous.

20:18.655 --> 20:21.305
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

20:21.340 --> 20:23.640
You can stay. There's a-a
nice waiting area upstairs

20:23.675 --> 20:25.329
and I will drop by when I can.

20:25.365 --> 20:27.223
But right now I have to go.

20:27.425 --> 20:29.364
I have patients that need me.

20:30.401 --> 20:32.056
All right?

20:39.256 --> 20:41.224
He's under a lot of pressure.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.561
Excuse me.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.646
Where did you get that?

20:45.682 --> 20:47.885
Uh, on the buffet tables.

20:53.910 --> 20:55.338
<i>Oh, my God, you have to turn that off.</i>

20:55.373 --> 20:57.306
<i>You're making me so nervous.</i>

20:57.517 --> 21:01.051
<i>Hi. Hi. Um, wow.</i>

21:01.191 --> 21:04.381
<i>Uh, I can't believe
that you guys are all here</i>

21:04.416 --> 21:06.850
<i>to see this dream come true.</i>

21:06.885 --> 21:11.640
<i>Painting has been a passion
of mine since I was a child.</i>

21:11.956 --> 21:13.923
<i>So, thank you.</i>

21:13.958 --> 21:17.593
<i>To all of you, to the
Thackery Gallery and, uh,</i>

21:17.628 --> 21:20.403
<i>especially to my parents.</i>

21:21.065 --> 21:23.033
<i>Okay, uh, sorry.
That is enough out of me.</i>

21:23.068 --> 21:24.868
<i>I'm so nervous,
I might actually run the risk</i>

21:24.903 --> 21:26.068
<i>of talking all night.</i>

21:26.103 --> 21:28.117
<i>So, enjoy the show.</i>

21:28.153 --> 21:29.706
LAWRENCE: <i> Which we know</i>

21:29.741 --> 21:31.708
<i>will be the first of many.</i>

21:31.743 --> 21:33.209
<i>Thank you, Dad. Thank you.</i>

21:33.244 --> 21:35.280
<i>Thank you, Dad. Enjoy the show.</i>

21:42.087 --> 21:43.053
(phone rings)

21:43.676 --> 21:44.917
Hello?

21:45.118 --> 21:47.891
Hi, um, my name's, uh, Nic Nevin.

21:47.926 --> 21:50.468
I'm calling from Chastain Park
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

21:50.504 --> 21:53.227
<i>Uh, your daughter, Sara,
is being treated here.</i>

21:53.263 --> 21:54.465
Is she all right?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.900
Well, she's safe, but I'm-I'm
afraid she's quite ill,

21:56.935 --> 21:58.485
- which is why I'm calling.<i>
- Yes...</i>

21:58.521 --> 22:03.239
Uh, I know. She has...
paranoid schizophrenia.

22:03.274 --> 22:04.908
<i>She refused to take her medication,</i>

22:04.943 --> 22:07.076
<i>and we told her if she was
going to live in this house,</i>

22:07.111 --> 22:08.787
she would have to.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.414
That was the last time we saw her.

22:11.449 --> 22:13.283
Mrs. Ravenscroft...

22:13.318 --> 22:16.610
<i>I-I assume you're putting her
on a psychiatric hold.</i>

22:16.988 --> 22:20.289
Um, we'll cover all of her expenses.

22:20.324 --> 22:23.427
Maybe you will have more luck
getting her on anti-psychotics.

22:23.462 --> 22:25.328
Mrs. Ravenscroft,
the doctors don't believe

22:25.363 --> 22:26.930
that she's mentally ill.

22:26.965 --> 22:29.432
(sighs) Forgive me
if I can't take the word

22:29.467 --> 22:31.301
of some random ER

22:31.336 --> 22:33.437
<i>over the diagnosis of
a world-renowned psychiatrist</i>

22:33.472 --> 22:35.005
<i>that examined her.</i>

22:35.040 --> 22:37.341
Maybe if you just,
if you just came to see Sara.

22:37.376 --> 22:39.343
She's scared and alone.

22:39.378 --> 22:40.611
I-I really think it would help if...

22:40.646 --> 22:41.945
<i>She's schizophrenic.</i>

22:41.980 --> 22:44.172
She needs to accept it.

22:44.983 --> 22:47.651
Please don't fill her head
with a lot of false hope.

22:47.686 --> 22:50.953
<i>Just give her the meds that she needs.</i>

22:51.424 --> 22:52.691
Thank you.

23:04.386 --> 23:07.188
- You guys reach her parents?
- Yeah, they're not coming.

23:07.223 --> 23:09.023
Her mom's convinced
Sara's schizophrenic.

23:09.058 --> 23:11.126
(scoffs)

23:11.161 --> 23:13.160
We need to figure out
what the real diagnosis is.

23:13.195 --> 23:14.795
Well, that's not gonna happen.

23:14.830 --> 23:17.165
She's getting sent back
to Atlanta General.

23:17.661 --> 23:19.627
They'll just treat her for
a pneumonia she doesn't have,

23:19.663 --> 23:21.692
load her up with olanzapine
and turf her again.

23:21.728 --> 23:24.566
Or worse, banish her
to their psych ward.

23:29.846 --> 23:31.094
Where you going?

23:32.048 --> 23:34.050
(mellow piano music playing)

23:36.019 --> 23:38.311
- This place feels pricey.
- Mm-hmm.

23:41.891 --> 23:44.594
- Champagne, Dr. Hawkins?
- No, thank you.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.075
TEJAN: Dr. Hawkins, could it be?

23:48.565 --> 23:51.066
H-Himaya, this is Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

23:51.101 --> 23:54.535
The mentor. So nice to meet you.

23:54.570 --> 23:56.141
I didn't catch a name.

23:56.177 --> 23:57.906
Oh. I'm Tejan, and this is Himaya.

23:57.941 --> 23:59.506
We're Devon's parents.

23:59.541 --> 24:01.208
Right, yes, you're in town. Oh, wow.

24:01.243 --> 24:02.843
It's... (chuckles) It's so nice
to meet you.

24:02.878 --> 24:04.346
So nice to meet you, too.

24:04.381 --> 24:06.370
Thank you for everything
you've done for our son.

24:06.406 --> 24:07.415
Yes.

24:07.450 --> 24:09.684
You should be very proud of him.
Excuse me,

24:09.719 --> 24:11.253
- I have to talk to someone.
- Of course.

24:11.288 --> 24:12.520
- He's so nice.
- Very nice.

24:13.173 --> 24:14.755
Who are they?

24:14.790 --> 24:17.725
Uh, I think I heard
telecom billionaire. I just..

24:17.760 --> 24:19.261
- Oh.
- Yeah.

24:19.296 --> 24:20.690
I have some news.

24:21.397 --> 24:24.032
We just admitted a VIP,
Sara Ravenscroft.

24:24.067 --> 24:25.766
Of the Savannah Ravenscrofts?

24:25.801 --> 24:28.013
The very wealthy and philanthropic

24:28.187 --> 24:30.371
Savannah Ravenscrofts. Correct.

24:30.406 --> 24:32.741
You put her on the 16th floor, I hope.

24:32.776 --> 24:35.243
That's a good idea.
I should... I'm, I just...

24:35.278 --> 24:36.878
I had her flying coach,
but let's upgrade her

24:36.913 --> 24:38.545
to the VIP wing immediately.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.880
Okay, well, I should go see her.

24:39.916 --> 24:42.450
Well, you've already met her.
She was here at the fundraiser earlier.

24:43.947 --> 24:46.721
Five-seven, blonde hair, dark roots.

24:46.756 --> 24:48.956
Carrying a $100,000 Xavier Mellino bag.

24:48.991 --> 24:51.531
I'm not gonna lie,
she could use a shower.

24:54.497 --> 24:56.452
Sara Ravenscroft is...

24:59.836 --> 25:01.569
Well, get her up on the 16th floor,

25:01.604 --> 25:03.070
and I'll be up there in a minute.

25:03.105 --> 25:06.057
Sure. But you have to deal
with Atlanta General first.

25:06.093 --> 25:10.278
You did call them to come get
their Jane Doe, right?

25:10.313 --> 25:11.780
(exhales)

25:11.815 --> 25:13.111
Yeah.

25:16.185 --> 25:18.454
(sighs)

25:26.328 --> 25:28.618
I appreciate the call, Randolph.

25:29.132 --> 25:31.332
Listen, I am sorry about the Jane Doe.

25:31.367 --> 25:35.003
Apparently, she ran off when
personnel just wasn't looking.

25:35.038 --> 25:38.272
Right. And walked three miles
to the closest hospital

25:38.307 --> 25:40.641
despite a severely compromised
sense of direction.

25:40.676 --> 25:43.445
Denying someone proper treatment
when they present

25:43.480 --> 25:45.179
with a clear emergency medical condition

25:45.214 --> 25:47.448
is a violation of federal law, Gavin.

25:47.483 --> 25:48.483
GAVIN: Listen.

25:48.518 --> 25:50.452
If one of our people turfed

25:50.487 --> 25:52.020
a homeless patient to your hospital,

25:52.055 --> 25:53.455
they will be terminated.

25:53.490 --> 25:54.680
Look, the only reason you're
here is because

25:54.716 --> 25:55.956
we threatened to tell the media

25:55.991 --> 25:57.658
Atlanta General dumps its undesirables.

25:57.693 --> 25:59.793
You're lucky we didn't call the cops.

25:59.828 --> 26:01.963
Randolph, if you came to us
with the same problem,

26:01.998 --> 26:03.465
we would handle it with discretion.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.699
Well, unlike your hospital,

26:05.734 --> 26:08.191
we treat everyone who
walks through these doors.

26:08.227 --> 26:09.860
So, what's really at play here?

26:10.173 --> 26:11.339
At play?

26:11.374 --> 26:13.387
You played us, Gavin.

26:13.423 --> 26:15.612
We're done here. You won.

26:20.849 --> 26:23.318
(woman laughing)

26:23.353 --> 26:25.552
Listen, I promise you,
they're gonna have you back up

26:25.587 --> 26:27.222
dancing the salsa with, um,

26:27.257 --> 26:28.389
what's your boyfriend's name again?

26:28.424 --> 26:30.492
Joe, but he doesn't dance much.

26:30.527 --> 26:31.859
Oh, I'm telling you right now.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.494
You could teach him how to dance, right?

26:33.529 --> 26:35.163
(laughter)

26:35.198 --> 26:36.731
How did you get here from your bed?

26:36.766 --> 26:38.417
Oh, the nurse was nice enough
to help me out.

26:38.453 --> 26:41.069
You see, Mrs. Reed's a little
nervous about her fractured ankle,

26:41.104 --> 26:43.504
so I'm just keeping her company
till the doctors come back.

26:43.539 --> 26:44.797
- I am better.
- Mm-hmm.

26:44.833 --> 26:47.298
- Thank you. Carry on.
- Mm.

26:47.376 --> 26:49.208
- (both chuckling)
- IRVING: What's up?

26:50.225 --> 26:52.847
- He's working the room pro Bono.
- (hoarsely): Hey,

26:52.882 --> 26:54.749
you guys save lives,

26:54.784 --> 26:56.417
I save people from loneliness.

26:56.452 --> 26:59.087
It's like my (gasps) superpower.
(gasping)

26:59.122 --> 27:00.466
Are you all right?
Your voice sounds different.

27:00.502 --> 27:01.688
And his breathing.

27:01.723 --> 27:04.089
My chest feels tight. (gasping)

27:04.125 --> 27:05.861
Having a hard time breathing.
(shallow, gasping breathing)

27:08.286 --> 27:10.732
- Palpable air under the skin.
- Subcutaneous emphysema.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.367
DEVON: Do you think
he swallowed some glass?

27:12.402 --> 27:14.269
- What's going on?
- Get up. Let's get you up.

27:14.304 --> 27:17.040
Your vomiting en route
may have been forceful enough

27:17.076 --> 27:18.858
to cause an esophageal perforation.

27:18.894 --> 27:20.707
Air is leaking into your chest.

27:20.742 --> 27:22.042
We need a STAT CT chest,

27:22.077 --> 27:23.946
esophagram, and call the OR.

27:25.615 --> 27:27.418
(monitor beeping)

27:31.253 --> 27:32.887
BELL: So, if it's not mental illness

27:32.922 --> 27:34.272
and it's not drugs, what is it?

27:34.308 --> 27:35.775
CONRAD: No definitive answer yet.

27:35.811 --> 27:38.058
How did Sara Ravenscroft
end up like this?

27:38.094 --> 27:40.751
Well, this is her chest CT.

27:44.601 --> 27:46.935
BELL: Multiple lesions.
They're too small

27:46.970 --> 27:48.403
to have shown up on previous X-rays.

27:48.438 --> 27:49.971
Wow, the disease is extensive.

27:50.006 --> 27:51.738
It could be TB, it could be cancer.

27:51.773 --> 27:53.574
I'm just waiting on her biopsy results.

27:53.609 --> 27:55.143
Okay, well, I'll call the lab,

27:55.178 --> 27:56.743
see if I can get them to speed it up.

27:57.173 --> 27:58.464
Thank you.

28:03.845 --> 28:05.253
Let's just wait and see.

28:05.288 --> 28:06.757
(phone buzzing)

28:06.793 --> 28:10.594
Uh, we got a problem.
They've come to take Sara.

28:10.826 --> 28:12.793
- I took care of Atlanta General.
- No, not Atlanta General.

28:12.828 --> 28:16.466
Her parents are here, with their
doctor and their private jet.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.724
NIC: Look, we can't let them take her.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.865
Sara is their daughter.

28:23.063 --> 28:24.646
And since she can't speak for herself,

28:24.682 --> 28:28.008
they get to decide her course of
treatment and where she has it.

28:28.044 --> 28:29.343
Okay, but they want to medicate her

28:29.378 --> 28:30.945
and put her in a psychiatric facility.

28:30.980 --> 28:32.780
That is not what is best for Sara.

28:32.815 --> 28:35.116
What if you're both wrong?

28:35.151 --> 28:37.318
What if her respiratory issues
and her mental health

28:37.353 --> 28:39.686
are unrelated, and what if
she is schizophrenic?

28:39.721 --> 28:41.622
What if we're right and her two
issues are connected?

28:41.657 --> 28:44.291
All I'm asking for is
a little bit more time.

28:44.326 --> 28:47.794
If we can really figure out what's
wrong with Sara and cure her,

28:47.829 --> 28:49.630
think about how much more
financially grateful

28:49.665 --> 28:51.835
the Ravenscrofts will be
to Chastain and to you.

28:55.403 --> 28:57.138
Okay.

28:57.173 --> 29:00.641
Okay. I can buy you,
I don't know, maybe an hour.

29:00.676 --> 29:02.976
But the minute they demand it,

29:03.011 --> 29:05.103
I have to discharge her.

29:09.537 --> 29:13.939
Forgive me for the delay.
Um, please take a seat.

29:13.974 --> 29:15.529
We're fine, thank you.

29:15.565 --> 29:17.197
When can we see her, Doctor?

29:17.444 --> 29:20.079
Well, i-in addition to her
mental disorientation,

29:20.114 --> 29:22.581
your daughter had bleeding in her lungs.

29:22.616 --> 29:24.484
And we've identified the lesion,

29:24.519 --> 29:26.151
which we're cauterizing as we speak.

29:26.186 --> 29:27.920
So it shouldn't be too much longer.

29:27.955 --> 29:29.422
The bleeding in her lungs,
is it serious?

29:29.457 --> 29:30.924
For someone her age,

29:30.959 --> 29:33.425
it's probably from a bronchitis
or pneumonia.

29:33.461 --> 29:35.994
Soon as she's back in Savannah,
I'll have a pulmonologist

29:36.029 --> 29:37.463
assess her while we treat her

29:37.498 --> 29:39.098
for the schizophrenia concurrently.

29:39.133 --> 29:41.501
We will need copies
of all of her records

29:41.536 --> 29:42.936
- and tests from tonight.
- Yeah, of course.

29:42.971 --> 29:44.436
Now, are you... are you confident

29:44.471 --> 29:45.650
with the schizophrenia diagnosis?

29:45.686 --> 29:47.620
We've had her diagnosed
by the best in the field.

29:48.603 --> 29:51.343
Would you object to sharing
that physician's name with me?

29:51.378 --> 29:53.612
Do you have any idea what it's like

29:53.647 --> 29:56.782
to watch the child that
you love just fade away

29:56.817 --> 29:58.650
piece by piece, Dr. Bell?

29:58.685 --> 30:00.880
We're supposed to protect our children.

30:02.193 --> 30:05.011
It almost killed me that I
couldn't protect her from this.

30:05.047 --> 30:07.049
LAWRENCE: But now
Sara can't speak for herself.

30:08.695 --> 30:10.797
So we finally have the legal power

30:10.832 --> 30:12.130
to do something about her condition.

30:12.165 --> 30:14.199
We've waited a long time

30:14.234 --> 30:15.868
to get her mental disorder treated.

30:15.903 --> 30:18.523
I'm in no mood for further delays.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.509
MINA: You know, I did some research

30:23.544 --> 30:26.280
- on cellular memory and transplants.
- Uh-huh.

30:26.316 --> 30:28.982
As it turns out,
there is a reason for you

30:29.017 --> 30:30.657
to be concerned about your heart donor.

30:31.051 --> 30:33.151
I found some studies
out of Singapore showing that

30:33.186 --> 30:35.888
the human heart can actually
store memory

30:35.923 --> 30:38.646
through combinatorial coding
of nerve cells.

30:39.059 --> 30:40.650
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

30:40.686 --> 30:44.230
There was one case, uh,
where an engineer in Iowa

30:44.265 --> 30:47.332
received a murderer's heart and
stabbed his buddy in the head

30:47.367 --> 30:48.667
with an ice pick.

30:48.702 --> 30:50.669
Wait, wait a minute. Are you sure?

30:50.704 --> 30:54.173
Yeah. In another case, a
God-fearing high school teacher

30:54.208 --> 30:57.843
from Conyers, Georgia received
the heart of a car thief

30:57.878 --> 31:00.379
and suddenly fabricated medical symptoms

31:00.414 --> 31:02.618
just to get his doctor
to go out with him.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.083
One can only wonder what
perverted intentions

31:05.118 --> 31:06.570
he had in mind.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.654
- So I wanted to go out with you.
- You lied.

31:09.690 --> 31:12.634
Yes, but my brain wanted
to do the right thing.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.344
My criminal heart held it
hostage. I'm sorry.

31:20.401 --> 31:21.434
I like you. All right?

31:21.469 --> 31:23.368
I know you're a good man.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.863
But I don't date patients.

31:25.899 --> 31:27.740
My career is my focus.

31:27.775 --> 31:29.378
Anything else is
an unnecessary distraction.

31:29.414 --> 31:31.380
What you want, I can't give.

31:31.416 --> 31:33.789
- I don't believe that.
- Believe it.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.231
And if you try to prove otherwise,

31:35.267 --> 31:36.732
I will guarantee you one thing.

31:36.768 --> 31:38.569
I will break your brand-new heart.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.639
Oh, I'll risk it. Turns out
they're replaceable.

31:42.155 --> 31:43.956
Good night, Micah.

31:43.991 --> 31:45.529
- Oh, you're weakening.
- (chuckling): I'm not.

31:45.565 --> 31:48.366
Yes, you are. Yes, you are... Hey, wait.

31:48.402 --> 31:50.505
Hey, oh. My heart just skipped a beat.

31:54.442 --> 31:55.865
It just skipped another one.

31:56.009 --> 31:57.643
(scoffs)

31:57.679 --> 31:59.331
Come on, you're killing me.

32:01.303 --> 32:03.041
You can't just leave me here.

32:06.314 --> 32:08.315
(monitor beeping)

32:11.512 --> 32:13.444
- Any progress?
- I'm missing a puzzle piece.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.980
I just don't know what it is.

32:15.355 --> 32:16.488
(Conrad sighs)

32:16.649 --> 32:19.082
What if we can't diagnose her in time?

32:19.366 --> 32:21.828
Then we go to plan B.
Try to get through to Sara.

32:21.863 --> 32:23.963
Get her lucid enough to make
her own medical decisions.

32:23.998 --> 32:27.500
(Nic sighs)

32:27.535 --> 32:28.765
Sara?

32:29.369 --> 32:30.800
Sara.

32:35.188 --> 32:38.318
Hey. Hey, I brought you something.

32:39.233 --> 32:42.115
These are tidal marshes.
You painted this.

32:42.150 --> 32:43.518
It has your name right there.

32:45.837 --> 32:47.254
You're very talented, Sara.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.151
Nic has a great eye.
If it weren't for her,

32:49.187 --> 32:51.205
I'd still have Bruce Lee posters
on my walls.

32:52.059 --> 32:53.993
(chuckles)

32:54.028 --> 32:55.494
Look, there's this one, too.

32:55.529 --> 32:56.999
See?

33:03.336 --> 33:05.024
(echoes): Sara?

33:06.339 --> 33:07.755
- (monitor beeping rapidly)
- Sara?

33:09.531 --> 33:10.831
Blood pressure's dropping.

33:10.867 --> 33:13.500
Give her a 500cc bolus.

33:13.847 --> 33:15.183
There's blood in her urine.

33:16.851 --> 33:19.551
Disorientation, ear infection,
pulmonary bleeding...

33:19.586 --> 33:21.445
Lung lesions, hematuria...

33:22.682 --> 33:24.287
Any skin lesions?

33:33.843 --> 33:35.153
Hey.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.769
I'll call the lab.

33:42.609 --> 33:44.209
How will we know if we're right?

33:44.244 --> 33:45.678
You'll see it in the blood.

33:45.713 --> 33:48.180
Reminder, I'm a nurse practitioner,
not a histopathologist.

33:48.215 --> 33:50.067
You don't have to be. You'll see.

33:50.103 --> 33:52.107
Chris, can you put it up?

33:55.867 --> 33:56.865
Wow.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.191
See the staining pattern
of the granular white cells?

33:59.226 --> 34:01.533
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.

34:01.569 --> 34:03.369
Sara has Wegener's.

34:03.405 --> 34:05.597
I've-I've read about it,
I've just never seen it.

34:05.632 --> 34:07.934
The disease attacks blood
vessels in multiple organs.

34:07.969 --> 34:09.868
I've never seen it attack
blood vessels in a brain,

34:09.902 --> 34:10.937
but it makes sense.

34:10.972 --> 34:12.405
It explains the psychosis.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.737
(exhales)

34:13.937 --> 34:15.206
What?

34:15.871 --> 34:18.076
Schizophrenia is not curable,
but this is.

34:18.112 --> 34:20.580
I mean, that's news
any family would pray for.

34:20.616 --> 34:22.650
(phone buzzing)

34:22.686 --> 34:25.302
- We can treat her.
- If she hasn't been discharged.

34:28.322 --> 34:31.474
Sara has a very rare autoimmune disease
called Wegener's.

34:31.510 --> 34:33.495
It's what caused the bleeding
in her lungs and kidneys.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.090
Which also, likely, caused
her erratic behavior,

34:36.126 --> 34:38.929
making her seem mentally ill
when she wasn't.

34:38.965 --> 34:43.469
You understand how we still find
this news hard to believe.

34:43.505 --> 34:45.040
SANDRA: The biopsy results

34:45.074 --> 34:46.808
confirm the diagnosis, Lawrence.

34:46.842 --> 34:48.308
The doctors are right.

34:48.342 --> 34:49.976
She isn't schizophrenic.

34:50.012 --> 34:51.645
BELL: Look, given the lack of research

34:51.679 --> 34:53.514
on Wegener's affecting
the brain this way,

34:53.550 --> 34:54.882
you know, I'm not surprised
Sara was misdiagnosed

34:54.918 --> 34:56.484
at that early stage.

34:56.518 --> 34:58.153
CONRAD: She's being
treated with medication

34:58.188 --> 34:59.821
to stop the body from attacking itself,

34:59.856 --> 35:01.321
but it may take hours

35:01.356 --> 35:03.158
- before we see any change.
- VERONICA: Dear God.

35:03.193 --> 35:04.820
We almost had her committed.

35:05.905 --> 35:07.864
She could have died.

35:10.578 --> 35:12.606
What if she never forgives us?

35:24.380 --> 35:25.579
(grunts)

35:25.615 --> 35:27.368
DEVON: The surgery was successful.

35:27.404 --> 35:28.537
Your face is gonna be fine.

35:28.573 --> 35:30.220
It'll heal without a scar.

35:34.224 --> 35:35.756
You seem stressed.

35:36.239 --> 35:37.558
Your parents.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.194
Are they still here?

35:39.229 --> 35:41.696
- It's that obvious, huh?
- (chuckles): Yeah.

35:42.498 --> 35:44.031
Hey, you know what I think?

35:44.066 --> 35:46.366
No, and I know that's not
gonna stop you from telling me.

35:46.401 --> 35:47.701
I think your father's not the only one

35:47.736 --> 35:49.104
with money and pride issues.

35:49.139 --> 35:50.862
I think it's you, too. Yeah.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.540
I think that you're anxious
that your in-laws

35:53.575 --> 35:55.910
won't think your family measures up.

35:55.945 --> 35:56.985
Excuse me?

35:57.021 --> 35:59.046
Hey, bro, listen, I
get it, man, I get it.

35:59.081 --> 36:01.281
I'm-I'm the kid of
immigrants, too, all right?

36:01.316 --> 36:06.256
I-I know how it feels to... to
be embarrassed by your parents.

36:08.490 --> 36:10.457
(quietly): God...

36:10.492 --> 36:12.961
When I was in high school,
I would just get so frustrated,

36:12.996 --> 36:14.596
you know, they couldn't grasp

36:14.631 --> 36:17.131
- simple Western mores.
- (chuckles): Yeah.

36:17.166 --> 36:20.291
You got it worse than me; your
dad's just a cab driver, so...

36:20.327 --> 36:22.305
Dude, you have no idea about my dad.

36:23.773 --> 36:25.105
Folks hear the accent

36:25.140 --> 36:26.741
and assume that he's beneath them.

36:26.776 --> 36:30.919
They have no idea that he is
a self-made entrepreneur.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.621
That he speaks three languages.

36:32.657 --> 36:36.416
Not to mention the courage
and the confidence it took him

36:36.452 --> 36:40.014
to uproot his family and start
all over in another country.

36:40.357 --> 36:43.361
Hey. I don't think I could do it.

36:46.919 --> 36:48.419
Your parents?

36:49.098 --> 36:50.799
They sound great.

36:53.702 --> 36:55.139
Yeah.

36:57.807 --> 36:59.439
Yeah, they are.

36:59.474 --> 37:01.477
(chuckles softly)

37:03.713 --> 37:05.744
- Okay, get some rest.
- Yeah.

37:06.481 --> 37:09.149
And, uh, for the record, you're
not so bad at talking to people.

37:09.184 --> 37:10.651
(laughs softly)

37:10.686 --> 37:12.787
You ever consider
a career in psychotherapy?

37:12.822 --> 37:14.788
No, no, no. Too pretty.

37:14.823 --> 37:16.658
You know, but if the looks fade, maybe.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.493
- IRVING: Channing.
- Ha.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.826
Ready to get back to work?

37:19.861 --> 37:21.129
I got to go check on my parents.

37:21.164 --> 37:23.288
Is your tuxedo pressed?

37:24.032 --> 37:26.133
Don't tell me they're at the fundraiser.

37:26.168 --> 37:27.679
Okay. I won't.

37:28.238 --> 37:30.274
But Conrad says they are.

37:32.049 --> 37:34.515
(Devon sighs)

37:34.843 --> 37:36.880
(piano playing)

37:38.180 --> 37:39.346
LANE: I have to say,

37:39.381 --> 37:41.381
your sari is stunning

37:41.416 --> 37:42.838
and such a breath of fresh air.

37:42.874 --> 37:45.542
This traditional Indian dress
is really very simple.

37:45.578 --> 37:47.311
An untailored length of cloth.

37:47.523 --> 37:49.323
- And yet so elegant.
- (laughter)

37:49.358 --> 37:50.725
HIMAYA: Traditionally, the sari was seen

37:50.760 --> 37:54.861
as a sign of purity,
because cloth, when cut

37:54.896 --> 37:56.897
and pierced with needles, was impure.

37:56.932 --> 37:58.031
- Fascinating.
- Mm.

37:58.066 --> 37:59.334
You know, I love to travel.

37:59.369 --> 38:01.002
I'll have to put India
on my bucket list.

38:01.037 --> 38:03.671
- (laughs)
- Uh, I wanted to thank you personally

38:03.706 --> 38:05.240
for your support of Chastain.

38:05.275 --> 38:07.174
Perhaps I could give you a tour,

38:07.209 --> 38:09.942
let you see where your generous
donation gets put to good work.

38:09.978 --> 38:11.546
- Donation?
- DEVON: Dr. Hunter,

38:11.581 --> 38:13.348
I'm sorry for the confusion.

38:13.383 --> 38:15.549
- These are my... parents.
- I'm Tejan Pravesh,

38:15.584 --> 38:17.504
and this is my wife Himaya.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.574
- Oh.
- Devon is our son.

38:19.956 --> 38:21.555
Oh, s... I'm so sorry.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.890
I was told that you were
in the telecom business.

38:24.141 --> 38:26.730
I-I'm in... transportation.

38:27.332 --> 38:29.214
My father owns his own cab.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.659
He put me through medical school

38:31.901 --> 38:33.901
working seven days a week,
very long hours,

38:33.936 --> 38:35.508
and I'm very proud of him.

38:36.350 --> 38:39.274
LANE: You know, I-I don't
have any children of my own,

38:39.309 --> 38:41.743
but if I did, I would hope
they'd be as proud of me

38:41.778 --> 38:43.378
as Devon is of you.

38:43.937 --> 38:46.780
(exhales) Really, such
a pleasure to meet you both.

38:47.709 --> 38:50.011
- If you'll excuse me.
- TEJAN: Of course.

38:53.128 --> 38:55.762
I-I'm sorry we couldn't spend
more time together,

38:55.798 --> 38:57.297
but we had a lovely evening.

38:57.887 --> 39:00.294
I hope we weren't too much in the way.

39:00.329 --> 39:04.064
No, I... I owe you both an apology.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.466
I was...

39:06.501 --> 39:11.238
I was very dismissive of you
and your feelings at dinner.

39:11.273 --> 39:13.721
No... I was wrong to ask
about Priya's parents.

39:14.075 --> 39:15.911
No, you weren't.

39:17.225 --> 39:19.087
They've wanted to come visit,

39:19.648 --> 39:20.915
and I've been pushing back.

39:20.950 --> 39:22.667
I was...

39:23.119 --> 39:25.086
I was... (sighs)

39:25.121 --> 39:26.476
I was worried about...

39:28.691 --> 39:30.091
I was worried that they were gonna take

39:30.126 --> 39:31.792
creative control of the wedding.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.428
But it's more than that;
I just didn't know

39:33.463 --> 39:35.254
if you all were gonna get along.

39:37.817 --> 39:40.167
But I think it's important
that we all meet,

39:40.202 --> 39:44.591
and we-we... we honor
family traditions on both sides.

39:45.391 --> 39:47.774
We would like that very much.

39:47.809 --> 39:48.843
Yeah?

39:48.878 --> 39:50.416
- Hmm?
- Good.

41:01.883 --> 41:03.383

- Get away from me.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.388
NIC: Sara, it's okay, I'm Nurse Nevin.

41:08.423 --> 41:10.524
Look at me. You're fine, you're safe.

41:10.559 --> 41:11.926
They want to put me away,
they think I'm crazy.

41:11.961 --> 41:13.428
No one's gonna put you away, Sara,

41:13.463 --> 41:15.267
- because you're not mentally ill.
- NIC: You hear that?

41:15.531 --> 41:17.130
You're not crazy.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.267
- Huh?
- CONRAD: You have an autoimmune disease

41:18.303 --> 41:20.014
that's been untreated for a long time.

41:20.050 --> 41:22.236
VERONICA: And the medicine
that they're giving you now,

41:22.271 --> 41:23.703
it's reversing the disease.

41:23.738 --> 41:25.210
LAWRENCE: You were right, Sara.

41:25.246 --> 41:26.548
We were wrong.

41:28.276 --> 41:30.745
(quietly): I'm really gonna be okay?

41:30.780 --> 41:32.046

Um, Doctor?

Thank you both.

I, uh...

Thank you.

Well, we're just happy
you're all together again.

42:11.119 --> 42:13.421
And I better get an invite
to your next opening.

42:13.456 --> 42:15.490
