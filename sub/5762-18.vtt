00:00.100 --> 00:01.800
PREVIOUSLY
ON GHOST WHISPERER...

00:01.800 --> 00:04.700
THEY'RE WHAT'S LEFT OVER
OF OLD ROADS, ALLEYWAYS,

00:04.700 --> 00:07.700
THEY'RE WHAT'S LEFT OVER
OF ANOTHER TOWN-UNDERGROUND.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.400
Dad! YOU'RE ALIVE.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.000
IT HAS TO DO
WITH PAUL EASTMAN.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.200
YOU SENT HIM TO PRISON,
ONLY HE ESCAPED.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.100
I'VE PUT A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN JAIL,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.200
AND NONE OF THEM
HAVE COME AFTER ME.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.900
WHAT IF HE'S HIDING
FROM SOMEONE, SOMEONE WHO
HE SENT TO PRISON?

00:19.900 --> 00:21.600
WHAT IF HE'S JUST
LYING TO PROTECT ME?

00:21.600 --> 00:23.200
Jim: THE MAN KILLED
A LITTLE BOY.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.100
HE ESCAPED DURING
A PRISON FIRE.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.900
FACIAL BURN VICTIMS WEAR A
CLEAR MASK DURING TREATMENT.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.400
PAUL EASTMAN IS DEAD.
HE POSSESSED MY DAD.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.100
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO GET HIS REVENGE.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.400
I HAVE TO WARN MY DAD.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.500
DAD?!

00:38.100 --> 00:39.200
OH, MY GOD!

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
Jim: TOM GORDON!

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
TOM, WE'RE COMING IN.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.300
IT'S A GUNSHOT VICTIM.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.600
Man: WHAT ARE HIS VITALS?

00:50.600 --> 00:52.800
TOM, CAN YOU
HEAR ME, TOM?
LACERATIONS TO THE HEAD.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.700
HE MAY BE GOING INTO
FULL ARREST.

01:00.300 --> 01:04.599
I HAD TO. I HAD TO PROTECT HER, I HAD TO.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.800
TRY TO BE QUIET.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.000
I HAD TO.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.100
YOUR FATHER'S IN
CRITICAL CONDITION, AND THE NEXT
24 HOURS ARE KEY.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.800
HOW COULD HE BE ALIVE?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.900
I SAW HIM,
I SAW HIS HEAD.

01:33.900 --> 01:34.900
COLD FEET.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.800
HE HAD THE GUN
RIGHT AGAINST HIS TEMPLE, BUT HE MOVED HIS HAND
JUST AS HE FIRED.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.000
MAYBE HE CHANGED HIS MIND
AT THE LAST SECOND.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.700
NOW THE BULLET HAD LODGED
UNDER THE SCALP, BUT IT DIDN'T
PENETRATE THE SKULL.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.800
SO HE MADE IT THROUGH
SURGERY QUICK AND EASY.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.600
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS WATCH AND WAIT.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.300
YEAH.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.000
HEY, THANKS
A LOT, DOC.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.900
YOU GOT IT. JUST PAGE ME IF YOU NEED ME,

01:53.900 --> 01:55.800
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I NEVER
REALLY LEAVE THIS PLACE.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.700
HEY.
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

01:59.700 --> 02:01.900
I MEAN, HE MUST
HAVE BEEN POSSESSED.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.100
LOOK, BEFORE
WE BROUGHT HIM IN, HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.500
HE TOLD ME HE DID THIS
TO PROTECT YOU.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.600
PROTECT ME? FROM WHAT?

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
OR WHO.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.500
PAUL EASTMAN? NO, HE'S
HAUNTING MY FATHER.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.900
WHY WOULD HE BE
A THREAT TO ME?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.600
MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION
FOR DEAR OLD DAD.

02:35.900 --> 02:36.900
HEY.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.700
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

02:41.600 --> 02:43.200
BUT THEY TOLD ME
MAYBE YOU COULD.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.200
LOOK, DAD,
I'M-I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.600
I DON'T KNOW...

02:57.000 --> 02:59.200
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO MEAN TO ME.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.300
I MEAN, YOU LEAVE US
WHEN I'M 9,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.700
AND THEN YOU JUST...
COME BACK.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.300
NO EXPLANATION, NOTHING.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.500
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.200
OR WHAT I REALLY
THINK ABOUT YOU.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.800
SO IT'S A REALLY BAD TIME
TO DIE, OK?

03:28.900 --> 03:32.000
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.300
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.800
SORRY.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.000
THERE WAS A LINE
OUT THE DOOR.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.100
I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS
LIKE THIS ALL DAY!

04:11.100 --> 04:12.300
HEY, HEY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.900
BUT JUST DON'T TRY
TO PICK IT UP.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.100
I'M GONNA GET A BROOM.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.800
ARE YOU OK?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.800
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.700
HEY, HOW IS
YOUR DAD?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.100
UH, RESTING COMFORTABLY
OR SO THEY SAY,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.100
AND IF THAT'S TRUE,
HE'S THE ONLY ONE.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.500
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
IT'S A LONG STORY, BUT I
THINK MY DAD'S BEING HAUNTED

04:35.500 --> 04:38.300
BY THIS MAN HE SENT TO
PRISON, AN INNOCENT MAN.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
HAUNTED HOW?

04:39.600 --> 04:43.900
MMM, I THINK THIS GHOST
JUST FIGURED OUT A WAY TO POSSESS PEOPLE
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

04:43.900 --> 04:47.100
OR AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO GET
THEM TO DO THE THINGS HE WANTS DONE.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.700
LIKE YOUR DAD
KILLING HIMSELF?

04:49.700 --> 04:52.200
YEAH, THAT'S ONE THEORY. THIS
DOES NOT TASTE LIKE GREEN TEA.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.400
YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU TOOK MINE.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.900
OH. SORRY.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.900
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY NOW?

04:56.900 --> 05:00.800
I MEAN, WHY WOULD
PAUL EASTMAN WAIT 30 YEARS
TO GET VENGEANCE?

05:01.800 --> 05:04.700
ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE YOU
ACTUALLY EXPECT AN ANSWER?

05:04.700 --> 05:07.200
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU WORK ON THAT
FOR A WHILE,

05:07.200 --> 05:08.900
AND I'M GONNA GO GET US
SOME NEW GLASSES.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.700
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU NEED A BREAK.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.500
WE REALLY SHOULD
GO NEXT WEEK

05:13.500 --> 05:16.000
AND SEE THE TALL SHIPS COME
INTO THE HARBOR AT PIERMONT, OK?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.300
YOU MEAN DO SOMETHING FUN?

05:18.700 --> 05:20.100
I HAVE NO TRAINING FOR THAT.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.900
IT'S SETTLED!
WE ARE GOING.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.800
PAUL?

06:55.100 --> 06:56.500
PAUL EASTMAN?

07:04.300 --> 07:07.100
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THIS STUFF SCARES ME, DO YOU?

07:07.100 --> 07:10.000
WELL, FEAR IS A RELATIVE
THING, I'VE ALWAYS FOUND.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.000
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
POSSESSING MY FATHER.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.100
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT REVENGE.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
YOU BLAME HIM FOR
SENDING YOU TO PRISON.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.200
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.800
HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF
JUST TO GET RID OF YOU.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.400
HE THINKS YOU'RE TRYING
TO HURT ME.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.900
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S
BEEN HAUNTING ME IN MY DREAMS.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.300
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE HIM ALONE?

07:28.300 --> 07:29.700
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.500
IT'S TOUCHING
THAT YOU BELIEVE YOUR FATHER
TO BE SO NOBLE.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.200
NO, NEVER SAID HE WAS NOBLE,

07:36.600 --> 07:39.400
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE
DESERVES FORGIVENESS.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.200
HE DIDN'T SET OUT
TO HURT YOU.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.700
YOUR FATHER DIDN'T TRY TO
KILL HIMSELF TO SAVE YOU;

07:44.700 --> 07:46.900
HE DID IT
BECAUSE I MADE HIM.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.000
I PUT THAT GUN
TO HIS HEAD MYSELF.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.500
BUT HE'S STRONG,
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.900
HE SAVED HIMSELF.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
YOU REALLY DO HATE HIM.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.400
THERE ARE FEW WHO DESERVE
HATRED MORE THAN THAT MAN.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.600
SO TELL ME.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.500
I DON'T THINK I WILL.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.400
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BELIEVE ME.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.600
TRY ME.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.000
EVERY JOURNEY BEGINS
WITH THE FIRST STEP.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.100
MOM.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.600
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. WHY HAVEN'T
YOU BEEN ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.200
'CAUSE THEN I'D HAVE TO TALK
TO WHOEVER'S CALLING.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.400
THAT'S CLEAR.
COLD, BUT CLEAR.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
HOW'S THE NEW SHOP?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.900
I LIKE WORKING WITH FLOWERS.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.800
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,
THEY SMELL NICE.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.400
AND WHEN THEY DIE, THEY DON'T
COME BACK WITH COMPLAINTS.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.900
OK THEN.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.400
I'M NOT DISCUSSING
YOUR FATHER.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.300
WHO SAYS THIS IS ABOUT HIM?

11:09.300 --> 11:10.800
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.400
IS IT?
NO, IT'S ABOUT DAD.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.500
I AM NOT DISCUSSING
YOUR FATHER.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.700
FINE, LET ME TALK THEN.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.900
I FOUND OUT THAT HE PROSECUTED
A MAN NAMED PAUL EASTMAN FOR MURDER,

11:19.300 --> 11:22.500
ONLY HE WAS INNOCENT, AND HIS GHOST IS BACK
TRYING TO GET REVENGE.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.000
THIS IS SOUNDING A LOT LIKE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.900
DID YOU KNOW PAUL EASTMAN?

11:28.500 --> 11:30.600
I MEAN, DID DAD
EVER TALK ABOUT HIM?

11:30.700 --> 11:31.800
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

11:31.800 --> 11:32.900
WELL, HE'S GOT
HIS HANDS FULL RIGHT NOW.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.700
YOU KNOW, BULLET IN
THE HEAD AND ALL THAT?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.300
NOT THAT YOU'D CARE.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.300
IT WASN'T
LIFE-THREATENING.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
IT DIDN'T EVEN
GET PAST THE SCALP.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.800
SO YOU CHECKED ON HIM?

11:42.600 --> 11:43.900
ONE PHONE CALL.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.900
LOOK, MELINDA,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.800
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND
HARD-HEARTED ABOUT THIS,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.300
BUT YOUR FATHER
IS NOT A GOOD PERSON.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.100
HE'S NOT MISUNDERSTOOD.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.900
HE'S JUST PLAIN BAD.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.600
YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.800
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.700
HE DOESN'T EVEN...

12:04.300 --> 12:05.800
I LEFT THE DOOR
UNLOCKED.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.000
I HAVE TO GET BACK.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.700
I'M SORRY...
I CANNOT HELP YOU.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.800
Rick: YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE BIG PICTURE HERE.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.800
YOU CAN'T JUST GET CAUGHT UP
IN WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW,

12:21.800 --> 12:24.900
ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE TRAP THAT
WE ALL SEEM TO GET CAUGHT UP IN.

12:24.900 --> 12:28.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S WHERE
AM I, WHERE AM I GOING,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.400
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
THESE ARE-HELLO?!

12:31.500 --> 12:34.100
YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD REALLY BE TAKING NOTES ON THIS,
MY LITTLE FRIEND.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.100
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT TALKING
TO THAT GERBIL.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.800
HIS NAME IS BOB,
BY THE WAY,

12:37.800 --> 12:40.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I BOTHER WITH THIS GUY.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.800
IT'S IN ONE LITTLE EAR,
OUT THE OTHER WITH HIM.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.700
STABLE, WHICH IS MORE
THAN I CAN SAY FOR ME.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.300
WELL, STABILITY'S OVERRATED.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.700
I WOULDN'T KNOW. ANYWAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
PAUL EASTMAN,

12:48.700 --> 12:50.100
THE GUY WHO WAS
HAUNTING MY FATHER?

12:50.100 --> 12:51.800
NO, BUT IF YOU HUM
A FEW BARS.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.900
HE'S NOT ONLY HAUNTING HIM,
HE'S POSSESSING HIM.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.800
YOU KNOW, LIKE MAKING HIM
DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.200
I DON'T KNOW,
TRYING TO KILL HIMSELF.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
WELL, THE DEAD ARE REALLY
GETTING THE HANG OF THIS.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.100
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD NEWS
FOR THE LIVING.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.500
YEAH, AND I'VE ALREADY
TALKED TO EASTMAN,

13:01.500 --> 13:02.900
AND HE HATES MY FATHER
WITH A PASSION,

13:02.900 --> 13:05.200
SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO TURN THIS GUY AROUND.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.400
AND BY THE WAY,
I FOUND EASTMAN'S BONES BURIED IN THE BASEMENT
OF A HOUSE

13:08.400 --> 13:09.500
THAT HIS GHOST LED ME TO.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.300
THAT'S QUITE A "BY THE
WAY" YOU JUST LAID ON ME.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.600
DID ANYTHING ORDINARY HAPPEN
TO YOU IN THE PAST FEW DAYS?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.000
UM, NO.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.200
ANY IDEAS?

13:16.200 --> 13:18.700
WELL, NO ONE'S BONES ARE FOUND BURIED
IN SOMEONE'S BASEMENT

13:18.700 --> 13:20.600
IF THEY DIED A NICE,
HAPPY, PEACEFUL DEATH.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.400
I THINK HE WAS MURDERED AND
HE WANTS YOU TO SOLVE IT.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.300
NO, THAT'S TOO SIMPLE.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.400
I MEAN, HE WOULD HAVE LAID ALL
THAT OUT FOR ME FIRST THING.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.800
WHATEVER IT IS,
HE KNOWS THE ANSWER,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
AND HE WANTS ME TO FIGURE
OUT THE MYSTERY FOR MYSELF.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.500
WHY?
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM IF HE TRIED TO TELL ME-

13:33.100 --> 13:34.500
IF THAT'S FOR ME,
I ALREADY LEFT.

13:35.700 --> 13:36.300
HELLO?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.000
Jim: HEY, I FOUND SOMETHING
IN THE ARCHIVES.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.500
THAT HOUSE YOU WERE IN,
WHERE YOU FOUND THE BONES...

13:41.500 --> 13:42.800
YOU KNOW THAT HOUSE.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.000
NO, I DON'T.
YEAH, YOU DO.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.600
THEY MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE NAME
ON THE STREET, BUT YOU KNOW IT.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.200
HOW?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.100
THE NAME
ON THE ORIGINAL DEED

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
IS THOMAS
AND BETH GORDON.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.100
IT WAS YOUR PARENTS'
FIRST HOME.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.400
WHAT?!

13:59.900 --> 14:01.400
HONEY, IT'S THE HOUSE
YOU WERE BORN IN.

14:05.700 --> 14:06.700
BONES?

14:07.200 --> 14:11.000
AS IN A SKELETON
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE HOUSE
YOU AND DAD OWNED.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.300
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A
HUNDRED YEARS, FOR ALL YOU KNOW.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.600
NICE TRY.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.400
OK, THE BONES BELONG TO THAT
MAN THAT DAD SENT TO PRISON,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
PAUL EASTMAN. HE WAS THE
ONE THAT LED ME THERE,

14:20.300 --> 14:22.600
AND YOU'RE GONNA ACT LIKE YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.600
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
YOU NEVER BELIEVE ME ANYWAY.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.800
WHY SHOULD I?
YOU NEVER TELL ME THE TRUTH.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.800
THEN DON'T ASK.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.100
JUST LEAVE ME
IN PEACE.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.000
PEACE IS NOT AN OPTION
RIGHT NOW.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.200
ALL RIGHT? SOONER OR LATER, THE
POLICE ARE GOING TO GET INVOLVED.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.000
IT HAPPENED AT YOUR HOUSE,
THEY'RE COMING TO YOU.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
YOU BE MAY BE IMPLICATED
IN A MURDER!

14:40.900 --> 14:44.400
MELINDA, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT I SAY,

14:44.400 --> 14:46.700
BUT I AM ASKING YOU
THIS ONE TIME

14:46.700 --> 14:49.800
TO LISTEN TO ME-
LEAVE THIS ALONE.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.700
THERE IS NO GOOD
FOR ANYBODY AT THE END OF THIS ROAD.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.600
YEAH, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.500
I CAN'T LIVE WITH A LIE.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.400
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT WHAT
YOU CAN LEARN TO LIVE WITH.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.300
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
ANYTHING IN THE BASMENT.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.500
IT'S REALLY CHANGED.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.900
???

15:16.100 --> 15:18.500
YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE?
NO.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.000
TOO MANY BAD MEMORIES?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.400
TOO MANY MEMORIES, PERIOD.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.400
NOW I'VE SEARCHED
EVERY ONLINE NEWS SITE.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.100
PAUL EASTMAN
ESCAPED FROM PRISON AND WAS NEVER
HEARD FROM AGAIN.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.300
RIGHT. UNTIL HE SHOWS UP
AS A SKELETON

15:30.300 --> 15:32.700
IN THE HOUSE WHERE YOU AND
YOUR PARENTS USED TO LIVE.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.300
IT'S CRAZY.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.500
WHAT IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.400
I- I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.600
YOU KNOW, I... I JUST HAVE
THIS REALLY BAD FEELING.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.700
LIKE WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL WAITING ON MY DAD
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.200
YOU KNOW, OR TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.800
AND I JUST KEEP
GETTING HURT, AND THEN HE WALKS AWAY.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.200
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT MAYBE YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.300
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
CUT HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE,

15:58.300 --> 15:59.900
THE WAY HE CUT YOU
OUT OF HIS.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.100
I WISH I COULD.

16:01.900 --> 16:02.900
BUT I'M NOT HIM.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.700
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE STORE,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.400
OK.

16:16.100 --> 16:16.700
YEAH?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.600
HEY, JIM, DR. FARRINGTON,
JUST GIVING YOU A HEAD'S UP

16:18.600 --> 16:20.300
IN CASE THE HOSPITAL
HASN'T CALLED.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.700
TELL MELINDA THAT HER DAD
IS CONSCIOUS AND TALKING.

16:27.200 --> 16:27.800
YEAH.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
I'LL DO THAT.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.500
SORRY, I'M JUST
A LITTLE DIZZY.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.600
HEY, BOSS, DO YOU MIND,
UH, THIS IS MY FATHER-IN-LAW.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.000
DO YOU MIND IF WE, UH, TAKE A WALK TO MY
- THANKS A LOT.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.100
JIM CLANCY.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.100
I HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.600
IT'S IF I KNEW YOU.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.599
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, TOM.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.599
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME.
COME ON.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.300
YOU KNOW, UNLIKE MELINDA,
I GOT NOTHING INVESTED IN YOU,

17:10.300 --> 17:13.599
ZERO. YOU'RE JUST THE GUY WHO'S
PUT MY WIFE THROUGH A WORLD OF PAIN.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.800
SHE'D BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF
YOU NEVER TOOK ANOTHER BREATH.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.000
I ALMOST OBLIGED,
DIDN'T I?

17:20.599 --> 17:22.000
YEAH, BUT YOU MISSED.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.599
AND THEN YOU TELL ME
YOU DID IT TO PROTECT HER?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.000
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
BELIEVING THAT.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.700
I MISSPOKE.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.200
DO NOT MESS
WITH MELINDA'S HEAD.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.000
I WON'T HAVE THAT.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.600
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
TO STAND BY,

17:34.600 --> 17:37.000
WATCH HER TOSSED AROUND AND HURT
BY THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.600
BUT YOU...
YOU I UNDERSTAND.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.200
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
OH, I THINK SO.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.600
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
START TELLING ME THE TRUTH,

17:45.300 --> 17:48.700
OR I'M GONNA COME BACK HERE WHEN
YOU ARE SOUND ASLEEP IN YOUR ROOM,

17:48.800 --> 17:53.300
AND I'M GONNA CUT
SOME VERY IMPORTANT TUBES AND WATCH YOU DIE
FOR REAL, TOM.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.900
BUT JIM...

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
YOU'RE SWORN
TO SAVE LIVES.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.400
COMES OUT A ROARING SECOND
COMPARED TO SAVING MY WIFE.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.000
IT ALL GOES BACK
TO PAUL EASTMAN.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.900
HE SPENT 9 YEARS IN
PRISON, THEN HE ESCAPED.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.900
Tom: CAME TO FIND ME,

18:16.900 --> 18:19.700
ACTUALLY BETH AND ME
AND MELINDA.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.000
THE THING IS, PRISON
DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
HE WAS DEMENTED,
AND HE WANTED REVENGE.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.200
HE WAS GOING TO KILL
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.500
AND ME, TOO.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.500
Tom: COULD HAVE DONE
A LOT OF THINGS. I COULD HAVE
CALLED THE COPS.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.200
COULD HAVE DROVE HIS BODY
TO THE MOUNTAINS AND DUMPED IT.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.000
I WANTED TO KEEP HIM
RIGHT THERE.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.300
I WANTED TO ALWAYS
KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.700
WANTED TO KEEP THIS
IN THE FAMILY.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.900
YOU WERE THE ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.900
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
CLEAR CASE OF SELF DEFENSE.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.300
MAYBE.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.200
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A BIG MEDIA STORY.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.700
AND HOW WOULD MELINDA
HAVE PROCESSED ALL THIS?

19:13.700 --> 19:14.700
SHE WAS 9.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.100
WHAT IF SHE GOT HARASSED
ABOUT IT AT SCHOOL,

19:17.100 --> 19:19.400
OR HAD REPORTERS
FOLLOWING HER?

19:19.700 --> 19:22.700
SO YOU SEE, JUST LIKE YOU, MY FRIEND,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.400
BURYING A BODY

19:24.500 --> 19:27.300
CAME IN A ROARING SECOND
TO PROTECTING MY FAMILY.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.100
OH, YEAH.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.700
IS THAT WHY YOU LEFT THEM
RIGHT AFTER THAT?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.700
THERE'S NEVER ONLY ONE
REASON FOR THESE THINGS.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
THE IMPORTANT THING BOTH OF
US HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THIS-

19:42.000 --> 19:44.200
PAUL EASTMAN STILL
WANTS TO KILL ME...

19:45.000 --> 19:46.200
FROM THE GRAVE.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.000
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.200
I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY
TO CRY ANY TEARS OVER ME,

19:52.200 --> 19:54.100
BUT HE STILL WANTS
TO KILL BETH,

19:54.500 --> 19:56.300
AND HE STILL WANTS
TO KILL MELINDA.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.700
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP HIM.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.600
DO YOU?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.600
MY FATHER ADMITTED TO
YOU THAT HE'S A KILLER?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.000
YEAH. I KNOW. I KNOW
THIS SEEMS LIKE AN EPISODE

20:08.000 --> 20:09.500
<i>OF FATHER KNOWS BEST
GONE HORRIBLY WRONG,</i>

20:09.500 --> 20:11.300
AND I AM THE LAST GUY
TO DEFEND YOUR DAD,

20:11.300 --> 20:13.600
BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE
A CASE OF SELF DEFENSE.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.300
SO I GUESS WE KNOW WHY
PAUL EASTMAN WAS HAUNTING HIM.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.300
HEY, CORRECTION-
HAUNTING YOU, MEL.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.200
YOUR DAD TOLD ME THIS
GUY WANTS TO HURT YOU,

20:20.200 --> 20:22.600
YOUR MOM, AND HIM,
AND BY HURT,

20:22.600 --> 20:24.100
I DON'T MEAN JUST
PUSH AND SHOVE, OK?

20:24.100 --> 20:25.500
YEAH, I KNOW.
I CONVINCED MY DAD

20:25.500 --> 20:27.400
TO PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD
AND PULL THE TRIGGER.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.300
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
PAUL EASTMAN, HE'S A
POWERFUL GHOST, RIGHT?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.700
SO WHY HASN'T HE
POSSESSED YOU?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.800
WHY HASN'T HE REALLY
COME AFTER YOU?

20:36.800 --> 20:40.000
FOR ONE, HE OBVIOUSLY HAS THINGS
HE WANTS ME TO FIND OUT FIRST.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.600
YEAH, LIKE WHAT?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
SINCE I'M STILL ALIVE,
I DON'T KNOW YET.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.200
NOT A BIG FAN OF
THE GALLOWS HUMOR WHEN IT CONCERNS
YOUR SAFETY.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.400
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE IF IT HAD BEEN BOURBON.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.800
PINOT GRIGIO
HAS A PRETTY BIG KICK.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.700
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.600
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET HIM TO CROSS OVER.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.100
Tom: OK, I THINK
I CAN MAKE IT FROM HERE.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.700
GOOD ENOUGH, THANKS.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.900
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO GET OUT SO SOON.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.500
SIGNED MYSELF OUT.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.900
THERE'S TOO MANY SICK
PEOPLE IN THAT HOSPITAL.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.300
I NEED YOU TO LET ME
TAKE YOU TO PAUL EASTMAN.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.800
SERVES NO PURPOSE.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.700
IS IT TRUE?

21:28.700 --> 21:30.700
WAS HE REALLY GOING
TO KILL MOM AND ME?

21:32.500 --> 21:33.400
JUST A SECOND.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.700
MELINDA, IT'S
A LITTLE LATE...

21:39.600 --> 21:42.100
FOR ME TO BE A HERO
IN YOUR EYES.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
I DID WHAT I HAD
TO DO, THAT'S ALL.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.500
I SAVED MYSELF
AS WELL.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.700
I HEARD WHAT
YOU SAID IN THERE.

21:51.300 --> 21:51.900
WHEN?

21:51.900 --> 21:53.800
WHEN YOU CAME
TO MY HOSPITAL ROOM.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.400
A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.100
UNDERSTOOD.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.600
AM I EVER GOING TO FIND OUT?

22:02.300 --> 22:03.300
FIND OUT WHAT?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
WHO YOU ARE?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.000
IF YOU EVER LOVED ME.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.300
IF YOU EVER LOVED MOM.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.500
IF YOU LOVE ME NOW.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.000
MELINDA,
IT'S SO COMPLICATED-

22:17.000 --> 22:18.100
NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.300
EVERYBODY ALWAYS
SAYS THAT, BUT...

22:20.600 --> 22:22.700
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S PRETTY DAMN SIMPLE.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.000
EITHER LOVE
IS THERE OR ISN'T.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.200
NO EXCUSE, NO QUALIFICATIONS,

22:29.200 --> 22:30.500
NO COMPLICATIONS.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.300
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO PAUL EASTMAN?

22:34.300 --> 22:36.200
I WANT YOU
TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.900
I WANT YOU TO TELL HIM
WHY YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.300
I WANT YOU TO HAVE CLOSURE...

22:44.300 --> 22:45.900
WITH AT LEAST ONE PERSON.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.600
AND MAYBE
HE'LL LEAVE US ALONE.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.400
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
ANY OF THIS IS GOING TO END.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.900
ALL RIGHT.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.900
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING TO HELP, BUT IF YOU DO,
I WILL.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.100
I'LL COME TO
YOUR SHOP TONIGHT,

22:59.400 --> 23:01.900
AND AFTER IT'S OVER,
WE'LL TALK.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.800
AND I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME,

23:05.400 --> 23:06.600
ABOUT US.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.300
NO MORE
COMPLICATIONS.

24:06.000 --> 24:06.600
DAD?

24:07.500 --> 24:11.000
HEY. I WAS JUST
WALKING BY, I SAW THE LIGHTS ON.
EVERYTHING OK?

24:12.100 --> 24:12.900
YEAH.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.600
SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SOMEONE ELSE. WHO?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.200
NO ONE WORTH
TALKING ABOUT.

24:29.700 --> 24:30.300
Man: THANKS.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.400
HE'S GONNA HURT HER,
YOU KNOW.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.000
WHAT?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.300
SHE HAS TO KNOW.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.600
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SAVE HER.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.900
AND SHE HAS
TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.800
DON'T LET HER
FIND OUT FROM TOM.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.600
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.100
SHE'S SAFER
NOT KNOWING.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.900
NOT ANYMORE.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.700
OH, I HOPE YOU HAVE
SOME BOURBON AND A STRAW.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.000
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THE DAY I HAD.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.200
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
NO KIDDING.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.300
ABOUT WHAT?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.200
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.900
I LIED ABOUT NOT KNOWING
PAUL EASTMAN.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.800
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.200
WE WERE ENGAGED.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.500
I WAS LIVING WITH HIM
WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.300
PAUL AND I HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER
FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.100
I KNEW HE WASN'T GUILTY
OF THAT MURDER.

26:01.100 --> 26:04.500
I KNEW THAT A GHOST HAD
LED HIM TO THAT BOY'S BODY.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.100
BUT WHO WAS GOING
TO BELIEVE THAT?

26:07.100 --> 26:09.600
SO YOU WENT
TO THE PROSECUTOR...

26:12.900 --> 26:14.400
THAT'S HOW YOU MET DAD.

26:14.700 --> 26:15.500
YES.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.800
AFTER HE WAS
CONVICTED.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.600
I NEVER EXPECTED HIM
TO BELIEVE ME.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.000
I HAD TO SHOW HIM
THE GHOST IN HIS OWN OFFICE
BEFORE HE DID.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
WHERE IS HE?
RIGHT THERE, IN THE CORNER.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.500
WHAT'S HE WEARING?

26:27.600 --> 26:29.800
HE'S WEARING A BROWN SUIT,

26:29.800 --> 26:32.100
UH, PROBABLY FROM
THE LATE 1800s.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.700
HE'S GOT A GRAY BEARD,
WHITE HAIR, UH, LONG,

26:35.700 --> 26:37.100
AND GLASSES.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.600
YOU JUST DESCRIBED
MR. McLAUGHLIN.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.600
THIS WAS HIS OFFICE
LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.700
Beth: OF COURSE,
THEN HE DID BELIEVE ME,

26:45.300 --> 26:48.400
AND HE REALIZED
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT PAUL WAS INNOCENT.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.400
I TOLD PAUL
THAT THERE WAS HOPE;

26:51.800 --> 26:56.000
THAT TOM WAS DOING
EVERYTHING HE COULD TO FIND EVIDENCE
TO EXONERATE HIM.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.400
PAUL WAS THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.800
WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON,
IT WAS LIKE...

27:01.400 --> 27:02.800
I DIED INSIDE.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.400
I DIDN'T WANT TO.
I TRIED TO FIGHT IT,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.000
BUT I STARTED
HAVING FEELINGS FOR TOM.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.500
I THOUGHT HE WAS SUCH
A GOOD MAN.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.400
PAUL WAS GOING MORE
AND MORE INSIDE HIMSELF,AND...

27:17.700 --> 27:19.200
AND THERE WAS
TOM GORDON.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.200
???NTERED,
VERY SURE OF HIMSELF.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.800
AND HE CARED,

27:23.800 --> 27:27.700
OR AT LEAST HE DID THE BEST
IMITATION OF SOMEONE WHO CARED THAT I'D EVER SEEN.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.800
HOW DID YOU TELL PAUL?

27:32.800 --> 27:34.000
I DIDN'T.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.400
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL HIM?

27:38.100 --> 27:39.700
I WAS CONFUSED.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.300
I FELT GUILTY.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.100
HIS LETTERS WERE GETTING
SO ANGRY AND BITTER.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.400
I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TELL HIM.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.500
AND THEN HE KILLED
A MAN IN PRISON.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.100
HE WAS NEVER
GONNA GET OUT THEN.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.000
IT WAS OVER FOR HIM.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.800
AND YOU MARRIED DAD.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.500
I'M NOT PROUD
OF ANY OF THIS, MELINDA.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.600
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU,
MOM, REALLY. I'M NOT.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.500
HOW DID PAUL FIND YOU AFTER
HE ESCAPED FROM PRISON?

28:22.200 --> 28:25.400
HE READ SOMETHING IN THE
NEWSPAPER ABOUT TOM'S CAREER,

28:25.400 --> 28:28.700
AND IN THE ARTICLE
IT MENTIONED ME AND...

28:30.000 --> 28:31.400
AND THAT
WE HAD A DAUGHTER.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.500
HE STARTED A FIRE.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.700
HE ENDED UP
GETTING BADLY BURNED.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.600
AND WHEN HE WAS IN
THE HOSPITAL WARD,

28:40.300 --> 28:42.000
HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.400
HE FOUND US.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.900
WELL, I GUESS
YOU KNOW THE REST.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.300
DO WE KNOW THE REST?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.100
I MEAN, DO WE, BETH?

28:52.800 --> 28:56.400
OR ARE WE JUST GOING
TO WAIT AROUND FOR YOU TO TELL US THE NEXT BIG
MISSING PIECE IN MELINDA'S LIFE?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.400
JIM, DON'T.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.000
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M SICK OF THIS.

28:59.300 --> 29:02.900
I AM SICK OF PEOPLE
LIKE YOU AND LIKE HER FATHER

29:02.900 --> 29:04.600
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PROTECTING HER.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.800
WHO SHOULD STILL BE WATCHING OUT
FOR HER INSTEAD OF LYING TO HER!

29:08.100 --> 29:10.500
I MEAN, PLAYING MIND GAMES
WITH HER WHEN SHE'S IN DANGER.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.400
JIM, THIS ISN'T HELPING.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.900
BETH, ALL SHE EVER
WANTED FROM YOU

29:12.900 --> 29:15.100
WAS FOR YOU TO ACCEPT HER AS SHE IS.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.300
AND MAYBE FROM HER FATHER,
MAYBE AN EXPLANATION.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.400
YOU KNOW? HOW DO YOU
WALK OUT ON A FAMILY?

29:19.400 --> 29:21.100
AND FOR ALL THAT,
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.900
SHE STILL WANTS
TO UNDERSTAND.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.300
SHE STILL WANTS
TO FORGIVE.

29:26.700 --> 29:29.800
BUT EVERY TIME SHE
OPENS HER HEART TO YOU, YOU STICK
A KNIFE IN IT.

29:29.800 --> 29:34.600
BETH, YOU RAN AWAY
FROM EVERYTHING YOU COULD DO
IN YOUR LIFE.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.300
MY WIFE RUNS TOWARD IT.

29:37.300 --> 29:38.900
AND FOR THAT,
SHE DESERVES

29:39.000 --> 29:40.800
JUST THE LITTLEST BIT
OF RESPECT.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.400
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE TRUTH.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.400
I'M SORRY.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.700
MOM, I-
NO.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.500
HE'S RIGHT.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.700
YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
THERE IS ANOTHER
MISSING PIECE.

29:57.000 --> 29:57.900
WHAT?

29:59.300 --> 30:01.100
WHEN PAUL WAS ARRESTED...

30:02.600 --> 30:04.200
I WAS PREGNANT.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.800
MOM, WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

30:07.400 --> 30:08.800
I WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.700
PAUL EASTMAN
IS MY FATHER?

30:19.700 --> 30:20.600
YOU'RE LYING.

30:21.300 --> 30:22.100
No.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.000
WE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.300
WE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

30:26.800 --> 30:31.000
TOM WANTED YOU AND HE WASN'T AFRAID
THAT YOU MIGHT

30:31.600 --> 30:34.500
HAVE THIS THING,
THIS SO-CALLED GIFT.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
YOU'RE LYING!

30:36.600 --> 30:37.700
YOU'RE LYING.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.200
IS IT TRUE?

31:09.300 --> 31:10.300
IS WHAT TRUE?

31:10.800 --> 31:12.500
THAT YOU'RE NOT
MY FATHER?

31:14.700 --> 31:18.000
IF YOU SAY IT'S COMPLICATED,
I WILL KILL YOU RIGHT HERE.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.200
YOUR MOTHER'S TRYING TO
DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN US.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.300
YOU CAN SEE THAT,
CAN'T YOU?

31:33.900 --> 31:35.600
NO ONE
WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.900
COME WITH ME,
AND I WILL.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.200
COME WITH YOU WHERE?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.900
A PLACE WHERE YOU'LL BE SAFE.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.700
SAFE.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.200
RIGHT.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.500
LOOK...

31:48.800 --> 31:49.900
I'M SORRY.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.500
I REALLY AM.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.600
THIS WHOLE THING
IS SUCH A MESS.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.500
I NEVER MEANT FOR YOU
TO BE INVOLVED.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.100
NOT LIKE THIS.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.800
COME WITH ME, AND YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.000
I'M CURIOUS,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.800
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THAT NIGHT,

32:38.600 --> 32:41.000
THE NIGHT PAUL EASTMAN
CAME HERE?

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
NOT MUCH.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.800
JUST HIS FACE, WITH THAT
HORRIBLE MASK LEANING OVER ME. I WAS SCARED.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.000
WHAT ELSE?

32:49.500 --> 32:50.800
THAT'S ALL, WHY?

32:51.400 --> 32:52.400
COULD BE IMPORTANT.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.000
WHAT I REMEMBER?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.600
WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS AND
SEE IF YOUR ROOM JOGS ANYTHING?

33:14.100 --> 33:15.900
YOUR BED WAS
RIGHT OVER THERE.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.000
YOU NEVER EVEN
HEARD HIM COME IN.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.000
DID YOU SEE HIM LEAVE?

33:20.400 --> 33:22.900
NO. I JUST
WENT BACK TO SLEEP.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.700
YOU SURE?
YEAH.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.600
YEAH, I...

33:41.400 --> 33:42.600
THAT'S IT.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.200
THE BREAKING GLASS,
IT WOKE ME UP.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.200
AND THEN?

33:48.500 --> 33:49.800
AND THEN THE VOICES.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.600
Tom: THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR THE PLACE,
PAUL. YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW UP HERE AND-

33:52.600 --> 33:54.800
Paul Eastman: WHAT'D YOU THINK
I'D DO, MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?

33:54.800 --> 33:57.000
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO... YOU SHOULD TURN YOURSELF IN.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.600
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.700
I SAW ALL THE FILES.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.500
ALL THE COURT
RECORDS.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.100
YOU NEVER LIFTED
A FINGER TO HELP ME.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.800
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU TOLD BETH THAT YOU WERE
DOING FOR ME,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.600
THAT WAS ALL A LIE.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.199
YOU WANTED TO
KEEP ME IN PRISON!

34:13.199 --> 34:14.300
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK
BETH IS GOING TO SAY

34:16.400 --> 34:19.900
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT THAT YOU HIRED
THAT OTHER PRISONER TO KILL ME,

34:20.400 --> 34:24.000
THAT YOU WANTED ME DEAD SO THAT
YOU COULD HAVE HER ALL TO YOURSELF.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.199
SHE'LL NEVER BELIEVE YOU,

34:25.199 --> 34:26.900
BUT YOU DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

34:27.800 --> 34:28.900
I WILL.

34:48.900 --> 34:52.300
IT'S FUNNY HOW MEMORIES
CAN COME RUSHING BACK.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:54.800 --> 34:57.100
I'M SORRY, MELINDA,
BUT THE THING IS...

34:58.600 --> 35:00.800
I JUST CAN'T
LET YOU LIVE NOW.

35:07.100 --> 35:07.800
Melinda: WAIT.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.700
YOU KNEW PAUL EASTMAN
WAS INNOCENT,

35:09.700 --> 35:11.200
AND YOU KEPT HIM
IN JAIL?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.300
INNOCENCE IS KIND OF
A BROAD CONCEPT AT TIMES.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.800
BESIDES,
YOUR MOTHER WANTED ME

35:17.800 --> 35:21.000
AND NOT SOME NEEDY,
HAUNTED GUY.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.400
SO I JUST...

35:23.100 --> 35:24.900
MADE SURE HE STAYED
WHERE HE BELONGED.

35:24.900 --> 35:28.100
BUT YOUR MOTHER, SHE'S
NOTHING IF NOT DEVOTED.

35:28.100 --> 35:31.500
SHE JUST WOULDN'T...
GIVE UP ON THAT GUY.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.700
SO YOU TRIED TO HAVE
HIM KILLED IN PRISON?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.800
WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT PAUL
KILLED THAT GUY INSTEAD...

35:47.000 --> 35:48.900
HE HAD MORE ON THE BALL
THAN I THOUGHT HE DID.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.400
IT WAS A WIN-WIN
IN ANY CASE.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.300
HE WAS CONVICTED
FOR THAT MURDER, TOO.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.800
YOUR MOTHER AND I,

35:56.600 --> 35:59.500
WELL, NOT EXACTLY HAPPILY
EVER AFTER, I GUESS, BUT STILL,

35:59.800 --> 36:02.100
IT'S NICE TO... WIN.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.900
SO WHY DID YOU
COME BACK HERE?

36:04.400 --> 36:05.800
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

36:05.800 --> 36:08.700
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO GO
AND FIND THE UNDERGROUND, WAKE UP PAUL EASTMAN.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.600
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, MELINDA?

36:11.200 --> 36:12.900
YOU'RE JUST TOO GOOD
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

36:13.300 --> 36:16.200
I KEPT HOPING THAT YOU
WOULD GET SCARED OFF.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.700
BUT YOU DON'T SCARE EASILY, DO YOU?

36:21.700 --> 36:24.200
DAD, PLEASE... DAD!

36:24.200 --> 36:25.400
DON'T CALL ME DAD.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.400
I'm not your father.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.400
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!

36:43.200 --> 36:44.300
NO!

37:10.200 --> 37:11.400
HEY. HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:11.400 --> 37:13.300
YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

37:13.300 --> 37:14.700
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

37:14.700 --> 37:17.200
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EASTMAN'S
GHOST HERE, WITH THE BONES.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.800
HE'S DEAD.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.900
YOU'RE MY FATHER?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.100
HAVE YOU ALWAYS KNOWN?

37:37.200 --> 37:40.700
AFTER I DIED, I FORGOT ALMOST
EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.400
IT WAS LIKE
I'D BECOME PARALYZED,

37:44.700 --> 37:48.600
STUCK DOWN BELOW WITH ALL OF
THE OTHER ANGRY, BITTER SPIRITS.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.100
BUT THEN I SAW SOMETHING.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.700
SOMETHING THAT CHANGED
EVERYTHING.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.300
IT WOKE ME UP.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.200
WHAT?

38:05.700 --> 38:06.600
YOU.

38:07.100 --> 38:11.300
I SAW YOU MOVING
THROUGH THE CHURCH, AND I KNEW INSTANTLY.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.100
I FELT THAT
YOU WERE FROM ME.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.800
YOU WERE SO BEAUTIFUL.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.600
THE MORE
I WATCHED YOU,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.900
THE MORE I SAW HOW
YOU PINED FOR THE MAN

38:21.900 --> 38:23.800
THAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS YOUR FATHER;

38:24.100 --> 38:26.400
HOW YOU WERE WAITING
FOR HIM TO LOVE YOU BACK,

38:26.400 --> 38:30.600
AND I KNEW THAT
I COULD NEVER COMPETE WITH
YOUR IDEA OF HIM,

38:30.600 --> 38:34.800
SO I HAD TO TRY AND MAKE YOU
DESTROY THAT MYTH YOURSELF.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.800
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS
SO MUCH SOONER.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
YOU WOULD NEVER
HAVE BELIEVED ME.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.300
THIS WAS A JOURNEY YOU
HAD TO TAKE ON YOUR OWN.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
WITH MY HELP.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.600
YOU'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MAN

38:50.600 --> 38:52.800
WHO PRETENDED
TO BE YOUR FATHER,

38:53.800 --> 38:56.000
YOU NEVER SAW
THE ONE PERSON

38:57.200 --> 38:59.600
WHO WAS RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.100
I'VE TRIED.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.200
BUT SHE ALWAYS
PUSHES ME AWAY.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.000
AND SHE LIES
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.000
SHE ONLY WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.100
THAT'S WHAT MOTHERS DO.

39:15.800 --> 39:16.900
BUT YOU'VE ONLY...

39:17.300 --> 39:19.900
LOOKED AT HER IN THE SHADOW
OF TOM GORDON.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.900
BUT SHE HAS ALWAYS
PUT YOU FIRST.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.100
IT'S TIME...

39:27.900 --> 39:29.400
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.400
BE TOO GOOD
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.000
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR HATING ME.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.500
MOM, I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.500
YOU'RE BUSY FIGHTING
YOUR OWN BATTLES.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.200
YOU ALWAYS
BELIEVED IN HIM.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.400
I JUST DIDN'T
SEE HOW I COULD

39:54.500 --> 39:56.100
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.000
MOM, I'M RELIEVED.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.500
MY FATHER DIDN'T ABANDON ME.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.800
AT LEAST NOT BY CHOICE.

40:07.100 --> 40:10.400
AND TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED ME IF HE COULD HAVE,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.500
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.000
SOMEWHERE, DEEP DOWN INSIDE, I ALWAYS FELT LIKE
I WAS DISPOSABLE.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.300
NOW I DON'T.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.300
Go.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.400
YOU NEVER WERE FOND OF
SEEING GHOSTS, WERE YOU?

40:47.500 --> 40:49.600
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION TODAY.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.700
HOW CAN I EVER
ASK YOU TO FORGIVE ME?

40:53.700 --> 40:56.100
I WAS SO
FULL OF RAGE...

40:57.000 --> 40:58.700
AT YOU AND HIM.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.400
I JUST WANTED YOU ALL TO
FEEL AS MUCH PAIN AS I DID,

41:03.900 --> 41:06.900
BUT THAT ALL WENT AWAY
WITH JUST ONE WORD.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.200
WHAT?

41:11.100 --> 41:12.100
"DAD."

41:14.300 --> 41:16.400
WHEN MY DAUGHTER
CALLED FOR ME,

41:17.500 --> 41:18.900
<i>WHEN SHE NEEDED ME,</i>

41:19.600 --> 41:21.300
ALL THE FURY
WENT AWAY,

41:22.100 --> 41:23.900
AND I JUST WANTED
TO SAVE HER.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.100
IF I COULD DO THIS
ALL OVER AGAIN-

41:27.100 --> 41:28.500
I WOULDN'T
CHANGE A THING.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.800
LOOK AT WHAT
WE CREATED.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.000
SHE'S THE REASON
WE CAME TOGETHER.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.100
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.100
NOTHING.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
THE LIGHT?

41:47.500 --> 41:48.300
YEAH.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.300
IT'S GETTING BRIGHTER.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.700
????

41:53.600 --> 41:54.700
I NEED TO KNOW.

41:54.700 --> 41:55.500
NO.

41:57.300 --> 41:58.300
THERE ISN'T.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.000
YOU'RE LOVED.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.400
THAT'S ALL,
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.300
AND SO AM I.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.000
CLEAN SLATE.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.000
CLEAN SLATE.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.000
YOU KNOW, UM,

42:42.800 --> 42:45.400
WE'RE ALL GOING TO WATCH
THE TALL SHIPS COME IN.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.200
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME?

42:47.300 --> 42:50.900
OH, NO, YOU-YOU GO ON
WITH YOUR FRIENDS. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.500
IT'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

42:54.700 --> 42:55.300
OK.

43:00.700 --> 43:03.700
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW
PROUD I AM TO BE YOUR MOTHER?

43:03.700 --> 43:05.100
YOU ARE MY MOTHER, RIGHT?

43:05.700 --> 43:09.800
YES. I AM DEFINITELY
YOUR MOTHER.

43:10.000 --> 43:20.000
