WEBVTT

00:02.443 --> 00:04.502
He just threw a curse
over the whole place.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.262
Come on, Thomas.!

00:07.339 --> 00:09.739
What happened? Moki, get an ambulance.
I don't know.

00:09.808 --> 00:13.767
- It's too late. - Henry Lewis could
have literally been cursed to death.

00:13.845 --> 00:16.837
Look at you. You're sitting around here
like you're ready to die.

00:16.915 --> 00:19.179
These are legitimate aches
and pains I got, Thomas.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.651
- That stuff's all folklore.
- Well, you tell that to Henry Lewis.

00:22.721 --> 00:25.246
Here! Over here!
They're over here!

02:33.751 --> 02:36.948
The final report before the board
takes up new business,

02:37.021 --> 02:39.615
will be given by Mr. Higgins.

02:39.691 --> 02:41.852
As the board is aware,

02:41.926 --> 02:45.555
I have placed a box for complaints
in the clubhouse lobby...

02:45.630 --> 02:49.794
so that members might voice any criticisms they
may have concerning the facilities and services.

02:49.868 --> 02:53.133
I call it my complaints corner.

02:53.204 --> 02:55.399
I have sorted through the complaints,
and would at this time...

02:55.473 --> 02:58.306
like to bring some of them
to the attention of the board.

02:58.376 --> 03:00.310
First,

03:02.847 --> 03:04.781
parking.

03:04.849 --> 03:08.512
Many members have complained that some
people are parking in the wrong spaces,

03:08.586 --> 03:10.520
or in spaces not assigned to them.

03:10.588 --> 03:14.080
The parking is supposed to be handled by our valets.
Some people continue to ignore this service.

03:14.159 --> 03:17.322
Probably because
they're too cheap to tip.

03:19.164 --> 03:22.998
The second complaint
deals with dress.

03:24.075 --> 03:25.831
Although this is a recreational facility,

03:25.904 --> 03:28.873
some portions of the club
do require proper attire.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.933
A requirement that some members
continue to blatantly ignore.

03:33.011 --> 03:34.945
And finally,

03:35.013 --> 03:39.279
I have noticed an inordinate number of guest
charges on one particular individual's tab.

03:40.075 --> 03:41.147
Whose?

03:41.219 --> 03:44.017
Put it on Robin's tab.

03:44.088 --> 03:48.616
I'll pay it, T.C. I just don't have
the cash on me right now, that's all.

03:48.693 --> 03:50.923
If that concludes all the business
for this meeting...

03:50.995 --> 03:53.862
Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled
to voice a formal protest...

03:53.932 --> 03:55.923
concerning the exploitation
of this club.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.492
Higgins, you're not gonna start in
on that surf ski race again, are you?

03:59.571 --> 04:03.302
Although I seem to be the only member who
understands the costly risks of this venture,

04:03.374 --> 04:05.569
I am not protesting the race,

04:05.643 --> 04:08.669
but rather the extravagant
promotional campaign for the race.

04:08.746 --> 04:13.479
I move this meeting be adjourned, so we can all
go watch the qualifying runs. I second it.

04:17.055 --> 04:20.957
You know, T.M., they got some pretty
strong-looking dudes in this surf ski race.

04:21.024 --> 04:24.392
You know, I've been watching
old Henry Lewis out there.

04:24.462 --> 04:26.487
Man, that cat's built solid
as a rock.

04:27.765 --> 04:30.529
You know what? When he's out
on that water in his surf ski,

04:30.602 --> 04:33.366
man, his muscles move
like a finely-tuned machine.

04:33.438 --> 04:37.704
Yep. Well, muscle
isn't everything, T.C.

04:37.775 --> 04:41.404
Yeah, that's what Rick
keeps telling me.

04:41.479 --> 04:45.711
But I'm gonna bet my money
on old Henry Lewis for sure.

04:45.783 --> 04:48.251
Him? What about me, T.C.?

04:48.319 --> 04:51.516
- You?
- Yeah.

04:51.589 --> 04:53.853
Me bet on you?

04:55.193 --> 04:59.152
Well, Rick's gonna bet on me.
Wanna bet?

05:00.965 --> 05:05.163
It's cheap commercialism. Oh, take it easy.
A little publicity isn't gonna hurt.

05:05.236 --> 05:08.103
It'll showcase the club and bring in new
members. New members mean new money.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.732
This is a private club,
not a three-ring circus.

05:10.808 --> 05:13.800
Higgins, it's only a couple of photographers
taking a couple of pictures with some quotes.

05:13.878 --> 05:18.474
It's not a big deal. It isn't.

05:18.549 --> 05:21.780
Hello. I'm Christine Richards
for Honolulu's KSFB.

05:21.853 --> 05:24.378
Which of you is the official
spokesperson for the club?

05:24.455 --> 05:26.423
I am.

05:26.491 --> 05:29.619
I'm Rick, the manager of the club.
I see.

05:29.694 --> 05:31.924
What can you tell us
about the race?

05:31.996 --> 05:34.055
Nothing. A lot.

05:34.132 --> 05:38.091
Well, today... today we're gonna have
qualifying sprints for the local contestants.

05:38.169 --> 05:42.003
But we do have entries from all over the
world... Mexico, France, Australia...

05:42.073 --> 05:44.064
England. And England.

05:44.142 --> 05:47.407
All total, it's about 300 people.
279.

05:47.478 --> 05:49.673
279, right.

05:50.782 --> 05:53.742
The route of the actual race, which won't
take place for another three days,

05:53.751 --> 05:57.585
will be from Moloka "I to O" ahu
which is approximately 30 miles.

05:57.655 --> 06:00.624
26.5 actually.

06:00.692 --> 06:04.788
The best part of the race is that we've
opened it up to nonmember entries,

06:04.862 --> 06:07.228
which is why we're expecting
a great, great turnout.

06:07.298 --> 06:10.495
The, um, um...

06:24.415 --> 06:27.111
- What'd he say?
- Wait. I wanna talk to you.

06:27.185 --> 06:31.747
No, man, let him go. I swear. I had
nothing to do with this caper.

06:31.823 --> 06:33.757
You know that guy, Moki?
He's a kahuna.

06:33.825 --> 06:36.794
He's a crackpot, a kahuna!
Anyway, the race was blessed already.

06:36.861 --> 06:40.729
That kahuna wasn't blessing.
He was cursing.

06:40.798 --> 06:43.266
He just threw a curse
over the whole place.

06:57.415 --> 07:00.213
He's probably too muscle-bound
to be very agile.

07:00.284 --> 07:03.310
That's the same thing
I was thinking, Charlie.

07:03.388 --> 07:06.983
Well, Henry's favored to win.
So I've heard.

07:07.058 --> 07:09.526
You gonna compete
in this craziness, huh, Magnum?

07:09.594 --> 07:11.755
I'm gonna give it my best shot.
How 'bout you, Charlie?

07:11.829 --> 07:16.232
Nah. I'm sticking
to my ocean laps.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.235
Besides, who can beat Henry?

07:35.553 --> 07:38.920
Hey, Henry, how 'bout a little one-on-one?
One-on-one with whom?

07:38.990 --> 07:43.256
- With me.
- Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding.

07:52.603 --> 07:57.006
He said he saw a demon hovering
over the club, the water, the sand.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.235
Did he say why?

07:59.310 --> 08:01.835
Unless he comes up with some specifics,
I'm just not gonna worry about it.

08:01.913 --> 08:05.713
Well, you'd better worry about it, especially
since the entire episode was captured on tape,

08:05.783 --> 08:07.808
courtesy of your free publicity.

08:07.885 --> 08:11.821
Higgins, now don't get shook up. He's probably a
crazy old man with a lot of time on his hands.

08:11.889 --> 08:14.915
It's precisely the kind of sensational
news coverage I was afraid of.

08:14.992 --> 08:20.294
Well, the only sensational news coverage
we'll get is if Thomas passes Henry Lewis.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.124
Hey, man.

08:24.202 --> 08:29.105
I ain't seen Thomas move his tail like that since he
was running away from them dogs of yours, Higgins.

08:33.477 --> 08:36.174
Hey, man, Thomas is starting
to gain on him!

08:36.246 --> 08:39.114
Let me see. Let me see.

08:39.183 --> 08:42.914
He is. Come on, Thomas.!

08:54.165 --> 08:57.862
Wait, wait, wait.
What the hell is Thomas doing now?

09:02.607 --> 09:04.598
Hey, man, something's wrong.

09:12.984 --> 09:16.511
Hey, Charlie, help me out over here.
Something's happened to Henry.

09:23.861 --> 09:26.091
Henry. Let's get him in.

10:01.499 --> 10:03.899
What happened? Moki, get an ambulance.
I don't know.

10:04.936 --> 10:07.461
It's too late.

10:07.538 --> 10:09.904
That's great, Bill.
Move in close. Get a close-up.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.003
He's dead.

10:41.237 --> 10:46.231
I didn't particularly like going to the
county morgue and inquire about a body.

10:46.309 --> 10:50.712
It's kind of like an impersonal reminder
of one's own mortality.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.442
But I was here anyway by choice.

10:55.318 --> 10:59.220
For some reason, I felt responsible
for Henry Lewis's death.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.553
Maybe because I was racing him
at the time.

11:01.624 --> 11:05.890
It was dumb, I know. But I'd feel better
when I found out why he died.

11:05.962 --> 11:09.125
Young lady, at the moment
I don't know why this man died.

11:09.198 --> 11:12.190
There's no evidence of any heart attack,
stroke or any other seizure.

11:12.268 --> 11:14.862
No signs of anything.
He just died.

11:14.938 --> 11:18.738
You're saying that a 35-year-old man
in perfect physical condition...

11:18.808 --> 11:21.003
just dropped dead
for no apparent reason?

11:21.077 --> 11:25.446
It's quite possible a combination of sun and
overexertion were just too much for him.

11:25.515 --> 11:29.383
It is my understanding that he paddles
20 miles regularly for recreation.

11:29.452 --> 11:32.615
Well, there's also a new theory
doctors are exploring.

11:32.689 --> 11:36.591
A condition that affects perfectly healthy
athletes causing them to drop over dead.

11:36.659 --> 11:41.528
Did you know that a kahuna cursed the King Kamehameha
Club moments before Henry Lewis collapsed?

11:41.597 --> 11:43.565
No, I didn't.

11:43.633 --> 11:46.466
Do you think that curse could have
had anything to do with his death?

11:46.536 --> 11:50.700
I don't think. I mean, I suppose, if Mr.
Lewis really believed in such things.

11:50.773 --> 11:53.367
Then you can't deny
the very real possibility...

11:53.443 --> 11:56.412
that Henry Lewis could have
literally been cursed to death.

11:56.479 --> 11:58.777
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.612
Aren't you getting a little carried
away with this? Who are you?

12:01.684 --> 12:04.551
- Huh?
- Who are you?

12:04.620 --> 12:07.817
- Thomas Magnum.
- Oh.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.450
You're the man who was racing against Henry
Lewis when he died, is that correct?

12:10.526 --> 12:14.462
- It was a trial heat, yeah.
- Are you a very close friend of his?

12:14.530 --> 12:16.498
No, I was just racing against him.

12:16.566 --> 12:19.091
Then what are you doing here?
Are you a member of the club?

12:19.168 --> 12:21.500
No. I'm a private investigator.

12:21.571 --> 12:23.596
I see.

12:23.673 --> 12:27.268
And the club has hired you
to investigate this very strange death?

12:27.343 --> 12:30.278
It wasn't a strange death.
I mean, the guy died.

12:30.346 --> 12:32.746
Then why did they hire you
to look into it?

12:35.651 --> 12:40.850
Well, as the official investigator
and spokesman for the club in this case,

12:40.923 --> 12:45.758
I can only say that we're not attributing
anything to this kahuna's curse.

12:45.828 --> 12:49.195
This is preposterous!
Official club spokesman.

12:49.265 --> 12:52.530
Come on, Higgins. I had to say something.
You can see what she was trying to do.

12:52.602 --> 12:54.934
What were you doing there
in the first place?

12:55.004 --> 12:57.964
- I was trying to find out why Henry died!
- His death doesn't concern you.

12:58.007 --> 13:01.465
- Yes, it does, Higgins. I hired Magnum.
- Thanks, Nadine.

13:01.544 --> 13:06.277
- We're doomed. - Only as long as we've
got that Christine Richards hounding us.

13:06.349 --> 13:08.283
She tends to get
a little carried away.

13:08.351 --> 13:11.411
Yes, that was Rick's idea for free
publicity. What are you doing?

13:11.487 --> 13:14.422
I think I got a sore throat.
Do me a favor. See if I got a temperature.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.691
There's nothing wrong with you. You're just
upset over what's been happening here.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.661
As well he should be.
This club is in critical condition.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.664
Yeah, tell me about it.

13:22.732 --> 13:26.293
Several people have requested to withdraw their
memberships, ten have pulled out of the race...

13:26.369 --> 13:29.395
and a swimmer almost drowned
this morning from cramps in the pool.

13:29.472 --> 13:34.102
- What swimmer? - A girl this morning went out to
do some laps, took a nosedive and almost drowned.

13:34.177 --> 13:36.270
They took her to the hospital.
Is she all right?

13:36.345 --> 13:38.279
Yeah, she's all right,
but that's not the point.

13:38.347 --> 13:40.645
The point is that it's starting
to get to everybody here.

13:40.716 --> 13:43.514
You'd thinkJaws is waiting out there
for his brunch. Take a look.

13:43.586 --> 13:45.781
But somebody wants it that way
for a reason.

13:45.855 --> 13:48.119
What for? All they gotta do is come
to me if they got a complaint...

13:48.191 --> 13:50.125
or stick it in Higgins's
little complaint box.

13:50.193 --> 13:52.661
I think it goes a little deeper
than a complaint, Rick.

13:52.728 --> 13:55.526
Maybe somebody has a grudge
against the club, or you.

13:55.598 --> 13:57.958
There's only one person
that would have a grudge against me.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.027
If you're insinuating that I would stoop
to such a low-handed trick...

14:01.104 --> 14:04.005
Hold it now!
I mean, come on. Look.

14:04.073 --> 14:06.007
Maybe somebody wants
to take over the club.

14:06.075 --> 14:09.101
Certainly not for profit.
This place is barely staying afloat.

14:09.178 --> 14:13.205
- How 'bout the land? - The land is leased
like all the other land on the Islands.

14:13.282 --> 14:16.012
They got another 46 years to
go on the lease. Forty-five.

14:16.085 --> 14:18.315
Forty-five.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.412
What's that?
It's the fire alarm!

14:23.426 --> 14:25.485
Fire extinguisher!

14:25.561 --> 14:27.620
Stay back!

14:29.132 --> 14:31.123
Get back.

14:35.371 --> 14:38.704
What happened?

14:38.774 --> 14:41.140
- Tell me in English. Now, what happened?
- Grease fire.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.940
Looks like someone threw a match
on an oil spill here.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.743
Come on, Rick. Take it easy.
It's out. It's just a little fire.

14:46.816 --> 14:48.943
This stove has suffered
severe fire damage.

14:49.018 --> 14:52.385
- Where's the rest of the cooks?
- They called in sick today.

14:52.455 --> 14:55.253
Allergic reaction to curses, huh?

14:55.324 --> 14:57.554
Get someone in here to clean this
up immediately. Yes, Mr. Higgins.

14:57.627 --> 14:59.627
And I expect something
to be done about this stove.

14:59.662 --> 15:02.222
I thought I'd bring a hibachi
in from home, Higgins.

15:02.298 --> 15:05.961
I've taken just about all
of your wise talk that I'm going to.

15:06.035 --> 15:09.801
When the board meets again, I'm sure a motion for
your dismissal will meet with unanimous approval.

15:09.872 --> 15:13.399
I'm gonna save you the trouble, pal. I'm
gonna quit first. How do you like that?

15:18.514 --> 15:21.005
I don't need this aggravation.
I really don't.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.483
Don't let Higgins get to you.
He really doesn't mean it.

15:23.553 --> 15:25.544
You guys are just
at each other's throats.

15:25.621 --> 15:28.556
Maybe so, but I'm getting tired of getting
blamed for everything that goes wrong.

15:28.624 --> 15:31.320
Rick, you're a good manager
and you know it. So does Higgins.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.329
The only thing Higgins knows
is that he wants me out. O-U-T.

15:34.397 --> 15:36.797
And quite frankly,
I'm getting to like the idea.

15:36.866 --> 15:38.834
You love this club.
You couldn't leave it.

15:38.901 --> 15:42.564
I should have kept the disco... Rick's
Café Americana. Remember, Thomas?

15:42.638 --> 15:47.473
The people, the music and Sam... good old Sam.
Now that was a club. That was a class-A club.

15:47.543 --> 15:50.011
Yeah, it was a bust, remember?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.445
Maybe so, but at least
it made me happy.

15:52.515 --> 15:56.212
The only thing this place is doing for
me is giving me indigestion. I'm going.

15:56.285 --> 15:58.617
My stomach's killing me.

16:08.731 --> 16:11.222
Moki? This is your drink.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.599
Moki. I gotta talk to you.

16:14.670 --> 16:18.197
Who was that kahuna
that was here yesterday?

16:18.274 --> 16:20.367
Oh, yeah. I don't know
anything about the guy.

16:20.443 --> 16:23.776
Moki, I don't wanna know his life story.
I just wanna know who he is.

16:23.846 --> 16:26.815
I never seen him before. Moki.

16:28.317 --> 16:31.377
It's a big island, Magnum.
It ain't easy finding guys like that.

16:31.454 --> 16:34.150
Well, give me a clue.
North Shore.

16:38.494 --> 16:42.658
And I believe his name
is Makua. Moki?

16:44.267 --> 16:46.167
Yeah, he's Makua.

16:46.235 --> 16:48.465
You knew he was all along
and you didn't say anything?

16:48.537 --> 16:52.735
He's a kahuna, Thomas. You know, they make
things happen that just can't be explained.

16:52.808 --> 16:55.504
If we find him,
we find who's putting him up to this.

16:55.578 --> 16:57.978
Moki is wise to be cautious
of Makua.

16:58.047 --> 17:00.538
But I don't think
you'll have any problems.

17:02.618 --> 17:05.519
I doubt his powers
could extend over you, Magnum.

17:06.555 --> 17:10.082
But then, you never know.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.796
It's harvesttime.
They're burning the sugarcane fields.

17:20.869 --> 17:23.498
I can almost feel the heat from here.

17:23.571 --> 17:27.473
I can't help if it's harvesttime, T.C.
Would you just keep reading?

17:27.542 --> 17:29.807
Oh, yeah. Uh...

17:29.879 --> 17:33.838
"" One of the most important rules among
kahunas is summed up in one of their vows.

17:33.916 --> 17:37.044
"""Learn to know all,
but keep thyself unknown.'

17:37.119 --> 17:40.919
That is why curses or warning
of death prayers... ".

17:40.990 --> 17:42.924
Death prayers?

17:44.960 --> 17:46.951
Keep going. That is why what?

17:48.831 --> 17:51.322
Death prayers?

17:51.400 --> 17:54.164
"" That is why curses or warning
of death prayers...

17:54.236 --> 17:57.967
are made known to their victims
through the mana. '".

17:58.040 --> 18:02.067
- Thomas, where'd you get this book? - I got it
from Higgins. What else does it say about kahunas?

18:06.549 --> 18:09.712
"" Kahunas look just like you and me.

18:11.821 --> 18:15.120
"" According to legend,
the only way to know for sure...

18:15.191 --> 18:17.159
"" if someone is a kahuna...

18:17.226 --> 18:21.390
is by the presence of a ruby flash
detectable in the eyes."

18:21.464 --> 18:25.560
A ruby flash detectable in the...
Why am I reading this nonsense?

18:25.634 --> 18:29.070
Because I wanna know what to expect
when I find Makua.

18:29.138 --> 18:33.131
- Makua? - Yeah, he's the kahuna
that cursed the club yesterday.

18:33.209 --> 18:35.143
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Thomas.

18:35.211 --> 18:38.146
You said you was taking me
to some nice, exotic place for lunch.

18:38.214 --> 18:41.945
You ain't mentioned nothing about looking
for no kahuna. Take it easy, T.C.

18:42.017 --> 18:45.077
That's stuff's all folklore anyway.
Oh, yeah?

18:45.154 --> 18:47.679
Well, you tell that to Henry Lewis.

19:06.909 --> 19:08.843
Hi.

19:08.911 --> 19:12.438
Hey, man,
I don't like this place.

19:12.515 --> 19:14.506
What's not to like?

19:16.852 --> 19:18.649
Hi.

19:18.721 --> 19:21.713
I'm looking for a man
named Makua.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.988
I knew it. I knew it.

19:25.060 --> 19:28.393
Uh, could you tell me
where I might find him?

19:28.464 --> 19:30.523
Here we go again.

19:30.599 --> 19:32.567
First you promise me lunch.

19:32.635 --> 19:35.365
Then you drag me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

19:35.438 --> 19:39.306
And then you come on like a
missionary with the Peace Corps. T.C.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.811
- Man, we're gonna wind up getting
our butts kicked. - No, we're not.

19:42.878 --> 19:45.813
I know one thing. That old boy ain't
gonna give you the time of day,

19:45.881 --> 19:48.315
much less where you can
find, uh, uh,

19:50.219 --> 19:51.982
a kahuna.

19:52.054 --> 19:55.182
You got a better idea, T.C.? You know
some other way I can find this guy?

19:55.257 --> 20:00.559
Well, I know struttin' up here, flashing a big smile
to these turkeys ain't gonna get you nothing.

20:00.629 --> 20:03.063
Since when are you an expert
on psychology?

20:03.132 --> 20:07.432
Well, since I started getting messed up in
these dumb cases of yours. That's when.

20:07.503 --> 20:10.802
Let me tell you something. You didn't
need to come out here... Hey, over there.

20:10.873 --> 20:15.071
Huh? Makua lives down
there in the last house.

20:17.413 --> 20:20.348
Thank you very much.
You've been a big help.

20:24.186 --> 20:27.053
I told you I knew
what I was doing.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.446
Uh, sounding like he's working
on a curse.

21:00.523 --> 21:03.754
Maybe we'd just better take off.

21:09.231 --> 21:10.926
Makua?

21:22.144 --> 21:26.513
Oh, man, I don't dig this.
Mm-mmm.

21:26.582 --> 21:28.516
Are you Makua?

21:33.188 --> 21:37.386
Man, uh-uh.

21:37.459 --> 21:39.188
Makua?

21:41.330 --> 21:44.060
Are you finished?

21:48.837 --> 21:51.931
Now, are you gonna tell me
who's putting you up to this?

21:54.076 --> 21:57.375
Uh, Thomas Magnum, why don't
you and I just get outta here,

21:57.446 --> 21:59.710
'cause I think this man
is about to spring the big one on us.

21:59.782 --> 22:02.376
Come on, Makua.
I know someone's setting you up.

22:02.451 --> 22:05.909
And if you don't tell me who it
is, I'm gonna curse you. Thomas!

22:11.160 --> 22:13.128
He can't do anything to us! Ha!

22:13.195 --> 22:17.495
Will you stop that? Charlie Kalo said
his powers could never extend over me.

22:17.566 --> 22:20.467
That's great for you. What about me?
You'll be fine.

22:27.910 --> 22:31.903
Over here.
He's heading towards the cane field.

23:04.013 --> 23:07.005
Makua!

23:12.721 --> 23:15.656
Makua!

23:16.959 --> 23:19.723
You ain't gonna find him in here, Thomas.
How 'bout over there?

23:19.795 --> 23:22.958
Barbecued sugarcane. Let's get out of here.
Let's get back.

23:23.032 --> 23:24.966
I'll drink to that.

23:30.173 --> 23:33.074
There's a backfire!

24:14.633 --> 24:18.228
Here, Bill! Here! Over here.
They're over here.

24:22.708 --> 24:24.972
There's a man trapped inside.
We gotta get help.

24:25.044 --> 24:27.342
The news car.
You can use the radio.

24:29.848 --> 24:31.839
Here.

24:33.852 --> 24:37.288
This is KSFB. I'm Tom Magnum
with Christine Richards.

24:37.356 --> 24:39.756
I need a fire truck
and an ambulance immediately.

24:39.825 --> 24:41.850
At the scene is Thomas Magnum,

24:41.927 --> 24:44.623
a private investigator
for the King Kamehameha Club,

24:44.697 --> 24:46.790
which yesterday was cursed
by a kahuna.

24:46.865 --> 24:50.596
Roger. Out. Mr. Magnum
was seen pursuing a man,

24:50.669 --> 24:55.732
a man who may now be trapped
inside the burning field.

24:55.808 --> 24:59.005
Why were you chasing that man into
the field? I wasn't chasing...

24:59.078 --> 25:02.047
Why is it that every time I turn
around, I seem to be running into you?

25:02.114 --> 25:05.606
Maybe it's because we were following the
same leads. I found out that the kahuna...

25:05.684 --> 25:09.347
You all right, T.C.? Yeah, I'm all right.
I just got a few cuts and bruises.

25:09.421 --> 25:13.261
Was this the man you were chasing... Will you get
that camera outta my face? Is your arm all right?

25:13.325 --> 25:16.988
- Who are you and how are you
involved in all this? - Reluctantly.

25:17.062 --> 25:19.929
Why were you chasing a man
into a burning sugarcane field?

25:19.999 --> 25:22.524
What?

25:22.601 --> 25:24.967
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.
- Oh, good.

25:25.037 --> 25:27.198
Now you are beginning to get
on my nerves.

25:27.272 --> 25:31.140
Now, I'm hot, I'm tired, and I am sick
of seeing you every time I turn around.

25:31.210 --> 25:35.340
Now, cover the fire, cover the race,
cover any damn thing you wanna cover,

25:35.414 --> 25:37.541
but quit following me.

25:44.623 --> 25:46.887
I hope he got out all right.

25:49.028 --> 25:52.725
Medical examiners are removing
the body of Makua Wani,

25:52.798 --> 25:54.732
a self-proclaimed kahuna,

25:54.800 --> 25:58.133
who yesterday cast a curse
over the elite King Kamehameha Club.

25:58.203 --> 26:01.661
Mr. Wani became trapped inside
the burning sugarcane field...

26:01.740 --> 26:03.901
while running from Thomas Magnum,

26:03.976 --> 26:07.241
a private investigator
assigned to the case by the club.

26:07.312 --> 26:10.713
I suppose you thought chasing him
into a fire would make him cooperate.

26:10.783 --> 26:15.880
You're starting to believe her too. I wasn't
chasing him into the fire. He ran into it himself!

26:15.954 --> 26:19.913
Maybe the curse died with him. There
is no curse, T.C...! It's a setup.

26:19.992 --> 26:24.895
- I still think it's the land. - I think it's a
stroke. Isn't a stroke when you go numb on one side?

26:24.963 --> 26:27.557
Will you stop it
with that already, Rick!

26:28.967 --> 26:31.231
I'm serious.
I'm losing my feeling.

26:31.303 --> 26:33.771
- You're losing your marbles.
- You're normal.

26:33.839 --> 26:36.000
- That's impossible.
- I agree.

26:36.075 --> 26:39.374
Stop it!
All of you, please, stop it!

26:39.445 --> 26:43.211
Now, the club is on the only land...

26:43.282 --> 26:45.773
this side of Waikiki
still relatively undeveloped, right?

26:45.851 --> 26:48.251
Yeah, but I keep telling you,
we got 46...

26:48.320 --> 26:51.118
- Forty-five.
- 45 more years left on our lease.

26:51.190 --> 26:55.751
As long as you can make the payments, but you can only make
the payments as long as the club is making money, right?

26:55.794 --> 26:57.921
Evidently it ain't turning
a profit now, is it?

26:57.996 --> 27:02.729
A profit? This club and that word have
never been used in the same sentence.

27:02.801 --> 27:05.861
You just take it easy, will you, Higgins?
Did you come in and make this club work?

27:05.938 --> 27:08.372
Until I got here, your bookkeepers
were using nothing but red pens.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.931
Someone wants to break the lease!

27:11.009 --> 27:15.446
And there's only one person who stands to benefit
from that... the person who owns the land.

27:40.339 --> 27:43.274
Mr. Magnum? Yes. Are you the
lady I spoke to on the phone?

27:43.342 --> 27:46.140
I told Mr. Dollinger,
so he is expecting you.

27:46.211 --> 27:48.202
He doesn't usually take visitors,

27:48.280 --> 27:51.181
so please, be as brief as possible.

27:58.857 --> 28:02.623
I can't take these
without my beer, Mrs. Macao!

28:02.694 --> 28:04.628
Now you know that!

28:04.696 --> 28:07.597
Calm down, Sidney.
You have a visitor.

28:12.237 --> 28:14.797
For his heart.

28:14.873 --> 28:19.833
He takes them with beer? Oh, it isn't real beer,
Mr. Magnum. The cans are filled with water.

28:19.912 --> 28:23.939
Sidney just likes to think
he can still drink like he used to.

28:24.016 --> 28:27.611
Now that's what
I call moviemaking.

28:30.656 --> 28:33.648
Sidney.
Nice, old-fashioned romance.

28:33.725 --> 28:35.716
Sidney! Hmm?

28:35.794 --> 28:39.890
Sidney, this is Thomas Magnum from
the King Kamehameha Club. Oh.

28:39.965 --> 28:43.401
- How do you do?
- Oh, well.

28:43.468 --> 28:45.402
Thank you, Mrs. Macao.

28:45.470 --> 28:48.303
We'll call you if we need anything.

28:48.373 --> 28:51.740
Sit down. Oh, thank you.

28:51.810 --> 28:56.645
She's a good nurse,
but she's always underfoot.

28:56.715 --> 29:00.048
- Would you like a beer?
- No, thank you. I don't think so.

29:02.955 --> 29:05.685
Well, uh, that's water.

29:05.757 --> 29:08.590
But this... is the real stuff!

29:08.660 --> 29:11.629
Well, in that case,
thank you, sir.

29:12.664 --> 29:16.361
So, you're from the King Kamehameha
Club, eh? How's it doing?

29:16.435 --> 29:18.494
Mabel Preston still a member?

29:18.570 --> 29:20.868
Uh, I don't know. I'm sorry.

29:20.939 --> 29:23.908
She was a gorgeous dish.

29:27.813 --> 29:30.008
Mr. Dollinger, about the land.

29:30.082 --> 29:32.209
Oh, I know.

29:32.284 --> 29:36.243
She's been after that
for as long as I can remember.

29:36.321 --> 29:40.121
- Mabel Preston?
- No, my daughter.

29:40.192 --> 29:43.719
A spoiled little brat who wants
everything made easy for her.

29:43.795 --> 29:46.457
She thinks all you have
to do is own it.

29:46.531 --> 29:50.023
But we didn't just own
that land, we worked it.

29:50.102 --> 29:53.333
We dug it, planted, harvested,
sugarcane, pineapple fields...

29:53.405 --> 29:57.967
all of it we did ourselves
with good, honest work.

29:58.043 --> 30:01.570
Your daughter wants the land back?
That's right.

30:01.647 --> 30:04.639
She wants to lease it to someone
who'll build one of those...

30:04.716 --> 30:08.777
big fancy hotels
or a bunch of condominiums.

30:08.854 --> 30:10.822
Well, is she here in Honolulu?

30:10.889 --> 30:13.949
I founded that club for the people.

30:14.026 --> 30:17.553
Notjust the rich,
the people that make this island...

30:17.629 --> 30:22.191
the Hawaiians, theJapanese,
the haoles... everybody!

30:22.267 --> 30:25.395
They're the ones that give it
the personality...

30:25.470 --> 30:27.404
and romance.

30:30.842 --> 30:34.437
You know how much I charge for
the lease on that land, Mr. Magnum?

30:34.513 --> 30:37.311
About 2,000 a month, sir.
Exactly.!

30:37.382 --> 30:40.579
Not $50,000 a month,

30:40.652 --> 30:45.112
or $100,000 a month, which is what you
could charge one of those foreign cartels,

30:45.190 --> 30:49.024
and there have been plenty
of offers, believe me.

30:49.094 --> 30:53.622
But I don't wanna make money
on that land.

30:54.733 --> 30:57.634
I want the King Kamehameha Club...

30:57.703 --> 31:01.036
to provide... happiness.

31:02.441 --> 31:06.707
I... I love that land, Mr. Magnum.

31:11.283 --> 31:13.808
Because it's for the people I love.

31:21.360 --> 31:25.228
So, you think your daughter
wants to break the lease, sir?

31:27.366 --> 31:30.733
Always... Always after me.

31:35.173 --> 31:37.232
Where does she live, sir?

31:37.309 --> 31:41.575
Always, always.

31:42.614 --> 31:44.639
Mr. Dollinger?

31:44.716 --> 31:48.277
Always, always...

31:48.353 --> 31:50.947
Sir? Uh...

31:51.023 --> 31:53.321
Always after me.

32:01.767 --> 32:03.928
Mrs. Macao.
Did you find out what you needed?

32:04.002 --> 32:07.995
Yes. Could you help me
get in touch with his daughter?

32:08.073 --> 32:11.270
His daughter? Sidney only has
one daughter, Mr. Magnum,

32:11.343 --> 32:14.835
and she's been dead
for nearly 15 years.

32:25.824 --> 32:28.224
So, you don't think there is
anything to this whole thing?

32:28.293 --> 32:31.414
No, I think we're letting superstition get
the best of us. What do you mean, we?

32:31.463 --> 32:33.590
I never fell for any of this
curse business to begin with.

32:33.665 --> 32:36.657
Look at you! You're sitting around here
like you're ready to die.

32:36.735 --> 32:39.602
These are legitimate aches
and pains I got, Thomas.

32:39.671 --> 32:42.469
Then how come they only showed up
after the kahuna cursed the club?

32:42.541 --> 32:45.169
I don't know!
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

32:45.243 --> 32:47.609
I'll tell you one thing.

32:47.679 --> 32:50.477
This whole episode has really taught me
something about people's behavior.

32:50.549 --> 32:52.676
That's just wonderful.
Let me ask you something.

32:52.751 --> 32:55.311
Did it teach you how to start getting
members to come back to the club?

32:55.387 --> 32:59.118
No. Think about it.
This guy shows up, he says a few words,

32:59.191 --> 33:03.127
and after that, everything that happens
gets blown way out of proportion.

33:03.195 --> 33:07.154
There I was this afternoon blaming an
80-year-old man for wanting to break the lease.

33:07.232 --> 33:09.564
Well, it's almost his anyway.

33:09.634 --> 33:11.898
Five more members
wanna quit the club.

33:11.970 --> 33:14.097
Thomas, we're not even making
bar money in here.

33:14.172 --> 33:17.335
To top everything off, the board
wants to cancel the ski surf race.

33:17.409 --> 33:21.812
- Call off the race? What for? - It's not gonna be
much of a race with only two people entered in it.

33:23.348 --> 33:26.977
Everybody wants to stay away
from this place, Thomas. Everybody.

33:27.052 --> 33:29.612
Just take a look around.

33:29.688 --> 33:31.713
Everybody.

33:39.464 --> 33:41.398
No, not everyone.

33:56.014 --> 33:57.982
Have a good swim, Charlie?

33:58.049 --> 34:01.678
Oh, it's always a good swim.

34:01.753 --> 34:04.745
But today it was perfect.

34:04.823 --> 34:08.953
- No crowds.
- No, there's certainly no crowds.

34:09.027 --> 34:11.257
Reminds me of the old days.

34:14.431 --> 34:18.266
- You like it better this way?
- Oh, some days, yes.

34:18.335 --> 34:22.237
Some days, no. But it won't
be empty like this for too long.

34:24.275 --> 34:28.303
Tell me, Charlie, how come none of this kahuna
stuff has bothered you? You're Hawaiian.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.746
It should have an effect on you too.

34:32.184 --> 34:34.947
Well, there are some people
to be afraid of, Magnum.

34:35.020 --> 34:38.284
And there are some people
not to be afraid of.

34:38.356 --> 34:41.813
Makua was somebody not to be feared.

34:41.893 --> 34:43.793
Hey, Magnum,

34:43.862 --> 34:46.659
I told you he don't
have no power over you.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.527
Do you think there is someone
who has power over me, Charlie?

34:51.603 --> 34:55.333
Always someone has power over you.
The thing to consider...

34:55.407 --> 34:58.205
is the power good or bad?

34:59.678 --> 35:02.442
Well, from the looks of things
around here, it's not too good.

35:02.514 --> 35:05.642
- Magnum, Rick has collapsed.
- What?

35:05.717 --> 35:07.776
We were talking.
Well, arguing, I guess.

35:07.852 --> 35:11.185
He suddenly turned white and dropped to the
floor. I didn't know he was really sick.

35:11.256 --> 35:14.885
- Where is he? -An ambulance is coming
to take him to Honolulu General.

35:21.833 --> 35:25.530
He was really sick.
I... I didn't know.

35:58.870 --> 36:02.465
Dr. Dan Webb to O.R. One.
Dr. Dan Webb.

36:07.512 --> 36:09.844
No, you'll have to wait out here, please.
But he's...

36:09.914 --> 36:11.905
No.

36:15.419 --> 36:18.479
Miriam Hara, you're wanted in X-ray.
Miriam Hara.

36:19.891 --> 36:23.327
Oh, no.
I'm not in the mood for this.

36:29.267 --> 36:33.260
I thought I told you to quit
following me. How is he?

36:33.337 --> 36:37.273
I don't know. He's sick. And I'm
sick of seeing you everywhere I go!

36:37.341 --> 36:40.105
Do you think that the curse could have
had anything to do with his illness?

36:40.178 --> 36:42.146
Oh, you're just not gonna
give up, are you?

36:42.213 --> 36:44.977
You're bound and determined to get yourself
a splashing byline on network news!

36:45.049 --> 36:47.745
Turn that damn thing off!
Hey, hey, Tom, take it easy.

36:47.819 --> 36:50.253
I'm only trying to do my job.
Ever heard of the First Amendment?

36:50.321 --> 36:53.848
I believe in freedom of speech too. But
I'm sick and tired of you hounding me,

36:53.925 --> 36:58.453
making insinuations and turning this
whole thing into sensationalism!

36:58.529 --> 37:01.464
Now you just stay out of my way.
Doctor?

37:01.532 --> 37:03.898
How is he, Doctor?
Is he gonna be all right?

37:03.968 --> 37:06.994
We don't know yet. We're still running tests.
Can you tell us what's wrong with him?

37:07.071 --> 37:11.974
Something is causing a muscle paralysis. Right
now we're checking him for spinal meningitis.

37:12.043 --> 37:16.639
It seemed like he had a heart attack, the way he
cramped all up real funny and then dropped over.

37:16.714 --> 37:19.080
No, there was no evidence
of coronary arrest.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.641
That's the same thing
that happened to Henry Lewis.

37:23.754 --> 37:27.622
So, if it's neither one of them,
what do you think it could be?

37:33.164 --> 37:35.598
Hello?

37:35.666 --> 37:40.194
This is Thomas Magnum. I talked to you this
morning about a man named Henry Lewis.

37:40.271 --> 37:43.763
Oh, yes, Mr. Magnum. I was just
going over the data on this case.

37:43.841 --> 37:47.971
Did you come up with anything, Doctor? Well,
so far everything looks pretty normal,

37:48.045 --> 37:50.343
except a severely
deficient potassium count.

37:50.414 --> 37:54.009
Could he have died from that?
He most certainly could,

37:54.085 --> 37:57.486
especially in combination
with exertion of a surf ski race.

37:57.555 --> 37:59.580
Well, I don't understand, Doctor.

37:59.657 --> 38:02.592
Why would his potassium level
be so low? Was he sick?

38:02.660 --> 38:06.619
Well, there could be a number of reasons,
but most likely some type of medication.

38:06.697 --> 38:09.632
Probably a diuretic to control
high blood pressure.

38:09.700 --> 38:15.036
I didn't see any signs of coronary deficiency in the
autopsy, so I don't know why he'd be taking diuretics.

38:15.106 --> 38:18.166
Unless he didn't know he was.
Pardon me?

38:18.242 --> 38:21.109
Uh, nothing. Thanks, Doctor.
You're a lifesaver.

38:21.178 --> 38:24.636
Lifesaver. Hmm. I'm a coroner.

38:25.917 --> 38:28.147
Check Rick
for a potassium deficiency.

38:28.219 --> 38:30.210
What makes you think he has...
just check him!

38:30.288 --> 38:33.086
Hey, hey, hey, man. Where you goin'?
I'll be back.

38:35.726 --> 38:38.194
Some of the things
that were going on at the club...

38:38.262 --> 38:40.856
might have been coincidence
or just plain accidents.

38:40.932 --> 38:45.028
But Henry's and Rick's ailments
were neither. Of that I was almost sure.

38:51.208 --> 38:54.905
If I found bottles of diuretics
on Sidney Dollinger's nightstand,

38:54.979 --> 38:57.743
he was gonna end up
being more than just senile.

38:57.815 --> 38:59.749
Mr. Magnum!
Where's Mr. Dollinger?

38:59.817 --> 39:01.751
He's sleeping right now.
I have to talk to him.

39:01.819 --> 39:07.223
You can't do that! What do you think you're
doing by pushing your way into this house?

39:07.291 --> 39:11.193
I just want to make sure he's
taking his medicine. What?

39:14.098 --> 39:17.090
I'm surprised you have any left,
Mr. Dollinger.

39:17.168 --> 39:19.932
Who is this man?
Oh, knock it off!

39:20.004 --> 39:22.905
- Mr. Magnum!
- Oh, yes.

39:22.974 --> 39:24.908
He's the man from my club.

39:24.976 --> 39:28.434
- Your club. I love it.
- So do I.

39:28.512 --> 39:31.572
The only thing you love is that
damn piece of real estate, Mr. Dollinger.

39:31.649 --> 39:34.516
What's he talking about?

39:34.585 --> 39:36.678
What am I talking about?

39:36.754 --> 39:39.416
I'm talking about you trying to bring
down the club to get back your land.

39:39.490 --> 39:42.084
I'm talking about you
killing people with these pills.

39:42.159 --> 39:45.424
Boy, I bought the whole act, the tears,
the weak mind, the whole thing.

39:45.496 --> 39:47.930
That's absurd!
Mr. Dollinger has done nothing!

39:47.999 --> 39:50.263
And that bit about your daughter,
that was a nice touch.

39:50.334 --> 39:54.600
My daughter? What about her?
Has she done something wrong?

39:54.672 --> 39:57.732
Knock off the senility act.
Your daughter's dead and you know it.

39:57.808 --> 40:00.038
Dead?

40:00.111 --> 40:04.070
Well, then what's she doing on TV?

40:04.148 --> 40:08.209
This man was later identified
as Makua Wani, a kahuna.

40:08.285 --> 40:11.812
Sidney, that's your granddaughter
Christine!

40:11.889 --> 40:13.823
Your daughter Sarah is dead.

40:13.891 --> 40:16.052
Remember, Sidney?

40:16.127 --> 40:18.493
That's your granddaughter Christine.

40:18.562 --> 40:21.156
Christine?

40:22.700 --> 40:25.498
- Not Sarah?
- As we reported earlier,

40:25.569 --> 40:29.335
this man was found dead just a few
hours ago in a burning sugarcane field...

40:31.075 --> 40:33.441
Well, she looks like Sarah.

40:33.511 --> 40:35.672
My mistake, Mr. Dollinger.

41:03.908 --> 41:06.536
Good evening, Mr. Magnum.
Would you care to take a drive?

41:06.610 --> 41:09.306
I'd like to talk to you.

41:09.380 --> 41:13.339
I'd prefer to take my own car,
if you don't mind.

41:13.417 --> 41:15.408
Fine.

41:30.634 --> 41:32.727
Wait a minute.

41:54.425 --> 41:56.893
All done?

41:56.961 --> 41:58.952
All done.

42:32.329 --> 42:35.196
Is that the lighter you used to start
the backfire in the cane field?

42:35.266 --> 42:37.666
Uh-huh.

42:41.539 --> 42:43.473
Actually, I was trying
to tie up a loose end,

42:43.541 --> 42:46.999
but since you were there, I figured I might
as well kill two birds with one stone.

42:47.077 --> 42:49.671
Three birds.
I had a friend with me.

42:54.585 --> 42:56.883
Where are we driving?

42:58.088 --> 43:01.148
Nowhere in particular.

43:01.225 --> 43:04.717
I just wanted to talk to you
and... show you something.

43:08.098 --> 43:10.692
All this land belonged to my family.

43:12.036 --> 43:14.402
That is to say, it used to,

43:14.471 --> 43:19.135
until my grandfather decided he was going to be
a great humanitarian and provide for everybody.

43:19.210 --> 43:21.542
Everybody, that is,
except his own family.

43:21.612 --> 43:25.173
So, the club land was
your last chance for survival, huh?

43:25.249 --> 43:28.741
- It's the only piece left.
- And you're killing people to get it.

43:28.819 --> 43:32.277
Oh please, spare the theatrics.

43:32.356 --> 43:35.154
Wars have been fought over land.

43:35.226 --> 43:39.686
I just waged one little battle to provide
for something that was rightfully mine.

43:41.365 --> 43:44.732
Tell me, Christine,
how did you find time to do it all?

43:46.036 --> 43:50.530
Well, it really doesn't take too much
time to put pills into a bottle.

43:53.077 --> 43:56.171
Henry Lewis,
was he just a sacrificial lamb?

43:57.715 --> 44:01.742
Henry was... convenient.

44:01.819 --> 44:06.051
I interviewed him at breakfast
the morning that you two had the race.

44:06.123 --> 44:08.091
And Rick,
was he just convenient too?

44:08.158 --> 44:10.558
Rick?

44:10.628 --> 44:12.926
Rick was just too good.

44:12.997 --> 44:16.489
He had that whole club
almost in the black.

44:16.567 --> 44:18.933
Oh, I couldn't let that happen.

44:19.003 --> 44:23.133
I can't break the lease
unless the club is going under.

44:25.709 --> 44:28.439
So, I guess this is all just
to cleanse your soul, huh?

44:28.512 --> 44:31.572
The club is gonna go under.

44:32.883 --> 44:36.819
When it does, I'm gonna prove
that my grandfather is senile.

44:36.887 --> 44:39.617
Then I'll sell the land
to the highest bidder.

44:39.690 --> 44:42.591
You could have a nice piece
of what I get. Forget it.

44:43.927 --> 44:47.658
Do you know how much money
I'm talking about? Millions.

44:49.099 --> 44:51.329
You could have your own Ferrari,
your own estate.

44:51.402 --> 44:54.599
You wouldn't have to borrow those
things, you know. You could buy them.

44:57.341 --> 44:59.673
That would take
all the fun out of it, Christine.

45:00.911 --> 45:02.902
Suit yourself.

45:12.723 --> 45:15.851
So that's it. You're just gonna
let me go to the police.

45:15.926 --> 45:18.724
Why not?

45:18.796 --> 45:22.630
All you've got on me is a theory that I gave
two men diuretics and one of them died of it.

45:22.700 --> 45:26.602
There are thousands of people who have access
to the kind of medication my grandfather takes.

45:26.670 --> 45:29.195
It's quite common.

45:29.273 --> 45:31.707
And Makua's dead,

45:31.775 --> 45:36.371
so he can't say that anybody paid
him to make that curse on the club.

45:36.447 --> 45:39.678
Okay, you can make things
a little tough for me.

45:39.750 --> 45:42.583
But I can play that game too.

45:42.653 --> 45:45.781
Before it's over, I'll have you
looking like a frustrated private eye...

45:45.856 --> 45:49.223
who was just getting a little too much
pressure from a probing reporter.

45:50.928 --> 45:52.862
You can't prove a damn thing.

45:52.930 --> 45:54.955
But you can.

45:59.536 --> 46:01.697
Yeah,

46:01.772 --> 46:06.675
the picture's probably not much to brag about, but
I'll bet your voice came through loud and clear.

46:08.512 --> 46:10.707
Just like a pro.

46:26.964 --> 46:30.491
Come on, Murphy.!

46:35.239 --> 46:37.503
You can do it.!

46:59.530 --> 47:02.727
- How'd I do?
- Fifty-eighth.

47:02.800 --> 47:06.099
- Fifty-eighth?
- Better than 59th!

47:07.604 --> 47:09.799
Hey, where'd you get all the money?
Bets.

47:09.873 --> 47:13.138
- But I didn't win.
- We know.

47:13.210 --> 47:16.270
Drinks are on me at the club,
everybody!

47:18.615 --> 47:21.379
He didn't bet on me.

47:21.452 --> 47:24.683
I saved his life
and he didn't bet on me.

47:24.755 --> 47:27.747
Hey, Magnum.
You did pretty good.

47:30.194 --> 47:34.221
Fifty-eighth isn't
even pretty good, Charlie.

47:34.298 --> 47:36.323
I was talking about the club,
you know.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.461
It's back to normal.
The race is a big success.

47:41.538 --> 47:44.769
Yeah, it's kind of nice to have the
place lively again, huh? Yeah.

47:44.842 --> 47:49.541
I was beginning to miss
the crowd myself.

47:49.613 --> 47:54.550
So, it turned out to be
the news lady, huh? Yeah.

47:54.618 --> 47:57.587
Old man Dollinger's
granddaughter, huh?

47:59.022 --> 48:01.991
I guess she was one of the bad powers
I had over me, huh?

48:03.227 --> 48:06.094
It could have been.
Could have been.

48:08.699 --> 48:12.465
You know, for a while, Charlie,
I thought it was you. Me?

48:12.536 --> 48:15.437
You're always around here,

48:15.506 --> 48:17.599
always making some kind
of ominous point,

48:17.674 --> 48:22.338
but then something about that
just didn't feel right.

48:22.412 --> 48:26.508
Maybe some guiding force
telling you a good power this time?

48:26.583 --> 48:28.983
I don't know, Charlie.

48:29.052 --> 48:31.520
You no believe in kahunas, huh?

48:31.588 --> 48:35.319
Well, the romantic in me
would like to,

48:35.392 --> 48:40.489
but curses, potions,
flashy ruby eyes...

48:40.564 --> 48:44.466
It's fascinating folklore, but it's tough
to really believe. You know what I mean?

48:44.535 --> 48:48.494
Maybe for a haole it is.
