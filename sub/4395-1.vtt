03:02.967 --> 03:04.967
Oh, my God. Fucking hell.

03:07.967 --> 03:10.550
Fucking bastards!

03:13.717 --> 03:14.883
Come on, you fuck...

03:15.592 --> 03:18.174
Mikey, get down! Mikey! Mikey!

03:26.216 --> 03:29.924
- I'm hit, Charlie. I'm hit!
- You'll be all right, Mikey. Hold strong.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.132
You'll not hang me alive, you bastards!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.964
Do I need to introduce myself?

04:18.630 --> 04:20.297
I know who you are.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.547
Good.

04:23.339 --> 04:25.005
I know who you are.

04:27.089 --> 04:30.089
My brother's taken a bullet, Stanley,
and is in need of medical attention.

04:30.464 --> 04:34.547
Well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother, Mr Burns.

04:36.505 --> 04:41.463
Christmas, as you're probably aware,
is fast approaching.

04:42.379 --> 04:47.046
And Christmas this year will hold a unique
significance for young Mickey here.

04:47.129 --> 04:48.546
Mikey.

04:51.129 --> 04:52.921
Because on Christmas Day,

04:53.254 --> 04:56.463
I have made plans that he be taken
from the jail in Banyon

04:56.838 --> 04:58.754
and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

04:59.004 --> 05:00.129
Charlie!

05:00.213 --> 05:02.421
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

05:02.879 --> 05:07.254
Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

05:11.128 --> 05:14.462
- So what is it that you want?
- I want Arthur Burns.

05:15.503 --> 05:17.545
I no longer ride with me brother.

05:27.503 --> 05:30.170
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think about it.

05:49.669 --> 05:51.711
What's happening, Charlie?

05:51.877 --> 05:53.586
It's all right, Mikey.

05:55.502 --> 05:56.627
It's all right.

06:06.501 --> 06:08.876
Australia.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.710
What fresh hell is this?

06:15.751 --> 06:19.501
I have kept company
with bad men all my life.

06:21.751 --> 06:25.126
I was 22 years in Her Majesty's Land Forces.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.585
I've dealt with your type many times.

06:26.668 --> 06:28.585
Touch me brother again, and I'll kill you.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.917
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.084
It will be done.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.000
I will civilise this place.

06:43.084 --> 06:45.417
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

06:50.417 --> 06:53.542
Listen to me now, Charlie. Don't speak.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.417
Hush, Mikey. You'll be fine.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.209
Hush.

07:07.666 --> 07:11.083
I wish to present you with a proposition.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.916
<i>I know where Arthur Burns is.</i>

07:19.541 --> 07:22.124
<i>In his godforsaken place.</i>

07:26.916 --> 07:30.165
<i>The blacks won't go there, nor the trackers.</i>

07:30.790 --> 07:32.957
<i>Not even my own men.</i>

07:35.123 --> 07:38.582
<i>I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.</i>

07:41.790 --> 07:43.790
<i>But I have other plans.</i>

07:43.915 --> 07:46.165
<i>I aim to bring him down.</i>

07:46.373 --> 07:49.165
<i>I aim to show
that he is a man like any other.</i>

07:49.248 --> 07:51.290
<i>I aim to hurt him.</i>

07:51.748 --> 07:53.373
When you're ready, sir.

07:57.497 --> 07:59.914
<i>And what will most hurt him?</i>

08:03.081 --> 08:05.622
<i>Well, I thought long and hard about that.</i>

08:07.831 --> 08:09.956
<i>And I have realised, Mr Burns,</i>

08:10.497 --> 08:14.247
<i>that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.</i>

08:19.872 --> 08:22.581
<i>Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.</i>

08:23.164 --> 08:25.205
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

08:28.746 --> 08:30.371
<i>Now, suppose I told you there was a way</i>

08:30.455 --> 08:32.955
<i>to save your little brother Mikey
from the noose?</i>

08:35.205 --> 08:38.705
<i>Suppose I gave you a horse and a gun?</i>

08:41.913 --> 08:43.913
<i>Suppose, Mr Burns,</i>

08:43.996 --> 08:45.663
<i>I was to give both you</i>

08:45.746 --> 08:47.330
<i>and your young brother Mikey here</i>

08:47.413 --> 08:48.496
<i>a pardon?</i>

08:52.954 --> 08:58.412
Suppose I said that I could
give you the chance to expunge the guilt

08:58.579 --> 09:01.162
beneath which you so clearly labour?

09:02.620 --> 09:05.037
Suppose I gave you till Christmas?

09:06.370 --> 09:10.245
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you?

09:12.370 --> 09:14.162
You want me to kill me brother?

09:14.745 --> 09:16.787
I want you to kill your brother.

09:22.036 --> 09:24.703
<i>Arthur Burns is a monster.</i>

09:25.411 --> 09:27.119
<i>An abomination.</i>

09:34.911 --> 09:39.661
<i>You were right to part company with him,
to take Mikey with you.</i>

09:41.411 --> 09:44.744
<i>What happened at the Hopkins place
was unforgivable.</i>

09:47.578 --> 09:50.368
<i>I have never seen such a sickening sight.</i>

09:50.618 --> 09:55.327
<i>Did you know that that poor woman,
Eliza Hopkins, had a child in her belly?</i>

10:51.283 --> 10:54.200
<i>Your business with your brother
is unfinished.</i>

10:55.533 --> 10:58.616
<i>You have nine days, Mr Burns.</i>

11:43.531 --> 11:44.864
Come on, let's hit them.

11:46.364 --> 11:47.698
Bastards!

11:49.781 --> 11:51.198
You got him!

12:03.406 --> 12:05.073
Pigs!

12:05.948 --> 12:07.073
Who have you got?

12:10.655 --> 12:13.780
Troopers! Dismount!

12:19.072 --> 12:21.530
The man I have brought in

12:22.280 --> 12:25.947
is Mike Burns, of the Burns Gang.

12:31.697 --> 12:34.655
So that's one down
and two to go, gentlemen.

12:37.737 --> 12:40.029
Gotta get him to get the other ones now.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.154
I will civilise this land.

12:45.821 --> 12:47.779
Make yourself at home, Mikey.

13:31.403 --> 13:34.902
- Good Evening to you, Mrs Stanley.
- Good Evening, Mr Broussard.

13:46.194 --> 13:49.027
Not so fucking dangerous now, is he?

14:05.693 --> 14:06.943
Martha?

14:10.818 --> 14:12.401
Good evening, gentlemen.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.609
- Good evening, Mrs Stanley.
- Good evening.

14:14.693 --> 14:16.943
You should really not come here.

14:17.026 --> 14:20.693
Cannot a lady visit her husband
in his place of work?

14:34.150 --> 14:37.400
You men wait outside.

14:46.483 --> 14:48.567
We spoke about why
you shouldn't come here.

14:49.192 --> 14:52.442
- This is not appropriate...
- Morris, you've been gone for three days.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.941
It's lonely up there at the house.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.316
It's so quiet without you.

15:01.399 --> 15:04.774
- Are you coming home now?
- Well, I have things to attend to.

15:07.066 --> 15:11.649
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.
I'll be back soon.

15:11.732 --> 15:13.357
You look terrible, Morris.

15:13.732 --> 15:14.816
Yes.

15:18.399 --> 15:20.024
Yes, I do.

15:24.565 --> 15:25.731
Dunn!

15:26.523 --> 15:27.898
Who is that?

15:29.690 --> 15:31.023
But he is no more than a boy.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.940
Well, he's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough indeed.

15:34.023 --> 15:35.106
Enough.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.981
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there until I return.

15:46.773 --> 15:49.356
- How long will you be, dear?
- Later.

16:00.939 --> 16:03.522
Never speak to my wife about such things
again. Do you understand?

16:03.647 --> 16:04.772
My apologies, Captain.

16:04.855 --> 16:07.272
What happened today on the Flats,
that's between you and me.

16:07.855 --> 16:09.230
Of course, sir.

16:09.314 --> 16:12.022
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.230
Yes.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.270
<i>Eliza Hopkins was a good Christian woman.</i>

17:12.853 --> 17:14.686
And she was my friend.

17:14.895 --> 17:17.769
I pray to God
that her death was mercifully swift.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.602
It was, wasn't it?

17:20.685 --> 17:24.060
Martha, can we speak of other things?

17:26.227 --> 17:28.227
Come here, Captain Stanley.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.768
My poor husband.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.434
The world you live in, in there.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.559
Don't be gloomy, dear.

18:27.184 --> 18:30.059
This burden you carry,

18:30.850 --> 18:33.475
you might let me carry it, too.

18:36.350 --> 18:38.267
I believe in you.

18:56.099 --> 18:58.683
Stay down. Stay in bed.

19:16.515 --> 19:17.723
What in God's name...

19:18.515 --> 19:19.932
Christ, sir.

19:20.557 --> 19:22.765
I've shot me bloody toes off.

19:28.932 --> 19:31.598
There's nothing to see here, Martha,
go back to bed.

19:31.848 --> 19:33.848
Officer Dunn has shot his...

19:35.806 --> 19:37.556
Martha, go back inside.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.804
Bloody flies!

20:48.595 --> 20:51.929
Kill one
and a dozen more turn up to his funeral.

20:54.179 --> 20:56.762
<i>Oh, Danny Boy</i>

20:56.845 --> 21:01.844
<i>The flies, the flies are crawling</i>

21:05.844 --> 21:08.511
A thousand pardons, my dear man.

21:08.594 --> 21:11.678
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

21:11.761 --> 21:15.219
No, no need for that, sir. No need for that.

21:16.261 --> 21:18.594
We are white men, you and I.

21:20.678 --> 21:25.678
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Jellon Lamb.

21:25.844 --> 21:29.468
Citizen of the world, you might say,
an adventurer,

21:29.635 --> 21:35.677
and if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

21:36.593 --> 21:38.177
And you, sir?

21:39.010 --> 21:43.302
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

21:47.552 --> 21:51.177
Of course, a mere detail.

21:52.885 --> 21:54.802
Mere detail.

21:56.842 --> 21:59.884
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

22:00.134 --> 22:04.509
with no one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

22:04.884 --> 22:08.676
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.884
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

22:14.134 --> 22:16.259
One more crack about the Irish, Mr Lamb,

22:16.426 --> 22:17.509
and I'll shoot you.

22:18.009 --> 22:21.301
- Am I clear?
- Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

22:21.467 --> 22:23.217
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.841
No finer race of men hath ever

22:26.425 --> 22:28.258
peeled a potato.

22:29.175 --> 22:33.800
- Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
- Good lord, son. No, I do not!

22:34.008 --> 22:37.425
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

22:38.008 --> 22:41.508
But, alas, I came to this beleaguered land,

22:41.633 --> 22:43.591
and the God in me just

22:45.258 --> 22:47.008
evaporated.

22:47.758 --> 22:50.175
Let us change our toast, sir.

22:50.383 --> 22:53.215
To the god who has forgotten us!

22:56.965 --> 22:59.924
The first, cardinal rule:

23:00.757 --> 23:07.215
Never raise a glass
with a man whose name you do not know.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.965
My name is Charles Murphy.

23:24.381 --> 23:26.131
Charles, eh?

23:26.964 --> 23:28.298
Perhaps you've read

23:28.381 --> 23:34.006
<i>On the Origin of the Species by Means
of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin?</i>

23:34.089 --> 23:39.006
Oh, don't be thrown by the title,
he had some most fascinating things to say.

23:40.173 --> 23:41.631
Chilling things.

23:42.548 --> 23:47.006
Mr Darwin spent time studying Aboriginals.

23:47.380 --> 23:51.422
He claims we are, at bottom,

23:52.547 --> 23:55.380
one and the same!

23:59.380 --> 24:02.172
He infers, Mr Murphy,

24:03.547 --> 24:08.838
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

24:12.630 --> 24:14.463
Monkeys!

24:20.587 --> 24:24.712
Mr Murphy! Russia, China, the Congo...

24:24.796 --> 24:28.629
"Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

24:28.712 --> 24:31.087
"in lands beyond the seas!"

24:33.337 --> 24:34.754
But nothing,

24:35.546 --> 24:40.462
nothing could have prepared me
for this godforsaken hole.

24:42.087 --> 24:45.420
You see, Mr Murphy,

24:47.461 --> 24:50.670
I am something of a fortune hunter.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.795
And what fortune
do you hunt out here, Mr Lamb?

24:58.878 --> 25:00.586
That would be
my question to you, Mr Murphy.

25:00.670 --> 25:01.795
Don't fuck with me.

25:01.878 --> 25:05.170
Unhand me, Murphy,
or I'll slit your fucking throat.

25:17.294 --> 25:19.335
We are white men, sir.

25:21.585 --> 25:23.335
Not beasts.

25:42.543 --> 25:46.709
He sits up there in those melancholy hills.

25:47.876 --> 25:52.543
<i>Some say he sleeps in caves like a beast,</i>

25:52.709 --> 25:55.293
<i>slumbers deep like the Kraken.</i>

25:56.751 --> 26:00.376
<i>The blacks say that he's a spirit.</i>

26:01.001 --> 26:03.376
<i>The troopers will never catch him.</i>

26:04.084 --> 26:07.417
<i>Common force is meaningless, Mr Murphy,</i>

26:07.500 --> 26:12.875
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

26:17.250 --> 26:20.958
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.500
I wait.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.875
Aye, you wait.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.874
You wait here, bounty hunter.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.832
- Hang him, sir.
- Hang him high, sir.

27:07.456 --> 27:09.540
Hail the conquering hero.

27:24.206 --> 27:26.581
What a vile specimen of humanity.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.123
What a little piece of filth.

27:32.580 --> 27:35.330
Not really the one that we're looking for,
though, is it, Captain?

27:35.497 --> 27:37.539
Well, in the end, justice will be done.

27:37.747 --> 27:39.164
"Justice."

27:40.039 --> 27:43.164
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.914
Has he told you where his brothers are?

27:47.997 --> 27:49.997
With due respect, Mr Fletcher,

27:50.164 --> 27:52.455
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

27:52.539 --> 27:54.205
to be done by policemen.

28:00.871 --> 28:02.871
What a little piece of filth.

28:05.788 --> 28:08.746
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

28:09.371 --> 28:11.579
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.

28:18.038 --> 28:21.288
<i>"When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky</i>

28:23.788 --> 28:27.453
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home</i>

28:30.120 --> 28:32.912
<i>"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry</i>

28:36.162 --> 28:38.537
<i>... said the rider, dry as a bone</i>

28:51.703 --> 28:53.620
Your roses are looking lovely.

28:53.953 --> 28:55.786
I've got green thumbs, I have.

28:57.494 --> 28:59.369
I was just thinking about England.

29:02.161 --> 29:03.661
Do you not miss it, Martha?

29:05.786 --> 29:09.702
There's much to miss, there and here.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.661
Let's get rid of that headache.

29:18.536 --> 29:21.827
Now, Captain Stanley,

29:22.702 --> 29:24.826
eat your breakfast before the flies do.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.243
Made by me own fair hands, them eggs.

29:33.368 --> 29:35.951
Me eggs have never tasted so fine, Mum.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.660
You're a good man, Morris.

29:40.618 --> 29:42.743
And you're a good woman, Martha.

29:47.493 --> 29:50.784
- Do we have company?
- Yes, I'm afraid we do.

29:56.784 --> 29:57.867
Captain!

30:10.200 --> 30:12.367
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, sir.

30:15.742 --> 30:18.658
- Martha, would you excuse us?
- It's fine, Morris.

30:18.741 --> 30:20.991
No, Martha, please. This is police business.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.199
How dare you come to my house
in that state?

30:33.283 --> 30:35.533
- Sir.
- What exactly do you want?

30:35.658 --> 30:37.699
We just got back
from the Arooka Ranges, sir.

30:37.866 --> 30:40.949
We rounded up six rebel blacks, sir.
Sean killed one.

30:41.074 --> 30:43.033
Thought you'd want to know about it
straightaway.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.157
Captain?

30:52.282 --> 30:53.573
Captain?

30:58.282 --> 31:00.573
No, leave the door open, it's rank in here.

31:00.907 --> 31:02.032
Yes, sir.

31:04.073 --> 31:07.407
Are you sure you put enough iron
on these men, Sergeant?

31:07.490 --> 31:10.115
They have been adequately secured, sir.

31:10.198 --> 31:12.323
- Jacko, get over here.
- Yes, Captain, sir.

31:13.032 --> 31:16.447
Ask them how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

31:20.197 --> 31:22.322
He says they are very tired.

31:24.031 --> 31:26.281
Well, you'll have a nice, long rest

31:26.447 --> 31:29.739
if you don't open your fucking mouth
and start yapping, you black bastards!

31:29.822 --> 31:30.989
Sergeant.

31:32.781 --> 31:34.197
Wait outside.

31:34.406 --> 31:35.864
Wait outside the door.

31:36.406 --> 31:38.281
I'll call you if and when I need you.

31:48.946 --> 31:50.946
Ask them again

31:51.321 --> 31:54.238
how long they've been hiding
up in the ranges.

32:02.238 --> 32:05.155
Captain, sir, he said they don't hide
in the ranges.

32:05.446 --> 32:06.613
They live in the ranges.

32:06.738 --> 32:09.655
Well, then ask him
how long they have lived in the ranges.

32:09.738 --> 32:12.112
Them always been living in the ranges,
Captain, sir.

32:16.029 --> 32:18.487
Ask him if they've seen
a white man up there.

32:18.654 --> 32:20.862
Yes, Captain, sir. I'll ask them.

32:33.070 --> 32:35.987
They seen white men.
White men catches them.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.737
Jesus Christ.

32:38.029 --> 32:39.569
I don't mean the police.

32:41.111 --> 32:42.694
This man...

32:44.278 --> 32:45.611
This man.

32:45.819 --> 32:47.653
A man with this man.

32:47.944 --> 32:49.069
A white man.

32:50.278 --> 32:52.486
This man. This man.

32:57.486 --> 32:58.569
Ask him...

33:01.028 --> 33:02.319
Fellow in the picture,

33:03.403 --> 33:04.944
he live in a cave.

33:05.486 --> 33:06.568
Dog man.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.652
Big fella.

33:09.610 --> 33:11.360
He said dog man never sleep.

33:11.693 --> 33:13.235
He sit there all day.

33:13.777 --> 33:16.943
Sit down in a cave, way up.

33:17.027 --> 33:20.777
He live with small fella and black fella.

33:21.735 --> 33:22.818
Cannot catch him.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.318
Cannot kill him.

33:25.902 --> 33:27.027
He's dog.

33:27.110 --> 33:29.235
What? He eats dog?

33:29.360 --> 33:31.985
No, Captain, sir. He is dog.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.610
He changed to dog.

33:34.401 --> 33:35.859
He grows ears.

33:36.484 --> 33:38.484
He grow teeth. Sharp.

33:38.776 --> 33:40.734
And he grows a tail, this way.

33:40.817 --> 33:41.901
Long.

33:42.567 --> 33:47.109
And he stand with two leg, like this,
and he goes...

33:54.359 --> 33:55.442
Sergeant!

33:55.984 --> 33:57.026
Sergeant!

34:01.526 --> 34:04.691
<i>"When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky</i>

34:07.316 --> 34:10.608
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home</i>

34:13.650 --> 34:17.025
<i>"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry</i>

34:19.190 --> 34:22.608
<i>"Me," said the rider, dry as a bone</i>

34:23.525 --> 34:26.483
<i>"How?" said the sun that melted the ground</i>

34:30.857 --> 34:33.982
<i>"Why?" said the river that refused to run</i>

34:36.107 --> 34:39.149
<i>"Where?" said the thunder without a sound</i>

34:41.857 --> 34:45.440
<i>"Here," said the rider and took up his gun</i>

34:59.106 --> 35:01.689
Captain is weak. A weak man.

35:01.939 --> 35:05.356
So you reckon he's weak, eh, Lawrence?

35:05.439 --> 35:07.481
Cocksucker. Fucking cocksucker.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.231
Come out here to sort out the niggers?
Fuck him. He's done nothing.

35:10.856 --> 35:13.481
Those black bastards,
they're running all over us.

35:14.064 --> 35:16.356
They chose the wrong man for the job.

35:16.773 --> 35:20.148
'Cause this isn't London. It's not England.
This is fucking Australia.

35:21.939 --> 35:25.356
Did I say
I wanted to fuck Captain's wife?

35:25.439 --> 35:28.063
Oh, will you go back to sleep, Paul?
For God's sake.

35:28.147 --> 35:29.480
I would like to fuck his wife.

35:29.563 --> 35:32.855
Yeah, well, if I was married to that bucket
of pig's tripe you call a fucking wife,

35:32.938 --> 35:34.438
I'd want to fuck her, too.

35:35.105 --> 35:37.272
I want to fuck his wife.

35:37.730 --> 35:40.188
- I want to fuck his wife.
- Oh, I could fuck her so.

35:40.397 --> 35:43.855
Yeah, all right,
we all want to fuck Mrs Stanley.

35:46.397 --> 35:49.813
She certainly isn't getting anything
from the good Captain, is she?

35:51.313 --> 35:52.480
And you know why?

35:52.688 --> 35:54.229
Oh, because he's weak.

35:55.896 --> 35:57.979
He's got other things on his mind.

35:58.854 --> 36:01.062
Because he really fucked up this time.

36:01.604 --> 36:05.729
He got the boy, yeah,
but he let the other one go.

38:11.683 --> 38:12.975
Fix him right up.

38:15.057 --> 38:17.682
Got good medicine. Fix him no time good.

38:17.766 --> 38:19.974
Gonna need sleep. Gonna need rest.

38:23.307 --> 38:24.516
No cry, daddy.

38:25.016 --> 38:26.932
That'll go on good and clean.

38:27.182 --> 38:29.474
Going to need sleep. Going to need rest.

40:29.887 --> 40:31.637
Good Afternoon, Mr Broussard.

40:33.345 --> 40:34.969
Remember to save a turkey for me.

40:35.177 --> 40:36.427
Of course, Mrs Stanley.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.427
Is everything all right?

40:45.344 --> 40:46.719
Go home, you stupid cow.

40:46.802 --> 40:48.261
I'm sorry, what did you say?

40:50.427 --> 40:54.136
Mrs Stanley, perhaps you better ask
your husband.

41:15.718 --> 41:16.801
Shut up, dog.

41:19.843 --> 41:21.676
Holy Mother of Mercy.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.343
Look who's raised himself from the dead.

41:24.593 --> 41:27.343
Him much better now.
Him much better because I fixed him.

41:27.426 --> 41:28.760
He don't look better to me.

41:29.925 --> 41:32.675
You know, Samuel, the thing
I relished the most while I was away

41:33.050 --> 41:35.259
was not having to see your fucking face
all the time.

41:35.550 --> 41:38.509
If it weren't for me and my crack shooting,
you'd be fucking dingo dinner.

41:38.592 --> 41:40.009
Thirty yards away, I was.

41:41.842 --> 41:43.967
Blew that black bastard's head right off.

41:44.425 --> 41:45.550
It was beautiful.

41:46.342 --> 41:47.634
So a bit of respect,

41:48.217 --> 41:50.050
or I might just have to shoot you

41:50.634 --> 41:52.217
with my new Winchester.

41:55.050 --> 41:57.217
Fuck! That hurt!

43:00.922 --> 43:02.422
- Oh, Charlie.
- Go easy, there.

43:02.506 --> 43:03.839
It's all right, Charlie.

43:07.131 --> 43:08.964
Do you want to know why I've come back?

43:09.714 --> 43:11.589
I know why you've come back, Charlie.

43:13.672 --> 43:15.297
Look at that.

43:19.172 --> 43:22.713
Be humble of heart, Charlie.
This is the end of things.

43:24.171 --> 43:27.296
You're my brother, Charlie.
You belong with me.

43:28.838 --> 43:31.671
We are a family. All of us.

43:33.588 --> 43:35.463
Yeah, I was just getting reacquainted.

43:35.546 --> 43:38.046
Samuel? Oh, be kind.

43:39.005 --> 43:40.713
A little tolerance, Charlie.

43:41.588 --> 43:42.755
Samuel's a boy.

43:43.130 --> 43:44.796
He's a vicious little cretin.

43:57.879 --> 43:58.962
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

43:59.670 --> 44:01.587
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

44:01.670 --> 44:03.129
You left Mikey alone?

44:03.420 --> 44:04.629
He met a girl.

44:06.504 --> 44:07.712
Mikey met a girl?

44:07.920 --> 44:10.254
Aye. Mikey met a girl.

44:17.087 --> 44:19.336
- What's her name, Charlie?
- Molly.

44:20.128 --> 44:23.169
- Molly.
- Molly O'Boyle.

44:24.544 --> 44:26.044
Molly O'Boyle.

44:30.003 --> 44:33.336
- A redheaded Colleen, no doubt.
- Aye. Red.

44:33.794 --> 44:35.461
Like the sunset?

44:36.628 --> 44:37.961
Like the sunset.

44:53.085 --> 44:56.335
What does she do, this Molly O'Boyle?

44:59.418 --> 45:01.918
I'm feeling a bit tired right now, Arthur.

45:02.002 --> 45:04.210
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good lamb stew?

45:04.293 --> 45:05.668
Would you just stop it?

45:15.292 --> 45:17.126
Mikey's not the same stuff as us.

45:18.584 --> 45:21.209
We've flung to the depths, you and I.

45:22.209 --> 45:23.709
He worships you, you know.

45:25.709 --> 45:27.376
There was a time we both did.

45:37.792 --> 45:39.792
Mikey deserves better.

45:40.167 --> 45:41.708
You were right to leave,

45:42.291 --> 45:43.666
take him with you.

45:46.291 --> 45:47.500
I need to rest.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.291
Mary O'Boyle?

45:49.916 --> 45:52.291
Molly, Arthur. Molly.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.125
Molly. Molly.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.333
Right. Molly.

46:12.249 --> 46:13.374
Fuck.

46:24.749 --> 46:25.874
Mikey.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.040
Mikey.

46:27.207 --> 46:33.332
<i>On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love gave to me</i>

46:34.165 --> 46:37.082
<i>Five cats a-flogging</i>

46:37.956 --> 46:40.831
<i>Four nooses swinging</i>

46:41.581 --> 46:44.164
<i>Three crows a-pecking</i>

46:44.831 --> 46:48.206
<i>Two dogs a-pissing</i>

46:48.956 --> 46:55.873
<i>And little Mikey hanging from a pear tree</i>

46:56.456 --> 46:58.914
Only five more days to go, Mikey.

47:11.205 --> 47:12.288
Martha?

47:14.955 --> 47:16.080
Martha.

47:18.413 --> 47:20.372
When Sergeant Lawrence said

47:21.413 --> 47:25.497
that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was "man enough,"

47:27.455 --> 47:28.913
what did he mean by that?

47:28.997 --> 47:31.372
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug

47:31.538 --> 47:33.787
with the moral fortitude of a snake.
Just disregard...

47:33.871 --> 47:35.579
What did he mean?

47:35.996 --> 47:37.246
What did the boy do?

47:37.454 --> 47:39.496
He's a member of the Burns Gang.

47:40.162 --> 47:41.954
There are certain things
that a woman shouldn't be privy to.

47:42.037 --> 47:45.204
- I know that, and I asked you a question.
- And I asked you not to visit me in my...

47:45.287 --> 47:46.829
- Just tell me what he did to Eliza.
- Enough!

47:46.912 --> 47:49.454
- She was my friend!
- Enough!

47:51.871 --> 47:52.954
That's enough.

47:57.579 --> 47:59.246
Headache, Captain Stanley?

48:07.995 --> 48:09.995
So what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

48:16.620 --> 48:21.578
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks, two days ago.

48:22.286 --> 48:24.703
And that one was shot in the process.

48:26.703 --> 48:28.078
And do you have a problem with that?

48:29.785 --> 48:31.244
Yes, Captain, I do.

48:31.910 --> 48:34.285
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

48:34.369 --> 48:36.785
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

48:36.869 --> 48:38.202
Are you sure it was blacks?

48:38.327 --> 48:40.494
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

48:40.577 --> 48:44.035
that he resembled your good old
garden-variety English hedgehog.

48:45.785 --> 48:50.160
It's simple, Captain.
It's called the Law of Reciprocity.

48:50.535 --> 48:53.702
Kill one of them,
and they're going to kill one of ours.

48:54.952 --> 48:57.826
Do the job I brought you here to do.

48:59.368 --> 49:00.951
If you have to kill one,

49:01.534 --> 49:04.034
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

49:04.951 --> 49:06.743
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

49:13.243 --> 49:14.993
Is our business here finished?

49:16.201 --> 49:18.701
- I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.
- What?

49:18.784 --> 49:20.076
One hundred lashes.

49:25.617 --> 49:26.783
Martha.

49:27.158 --> 49:28.533
Thank you.

49:29.033 --> 49:32.117
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

49:32.908 --> 49:34.325
Please, sit down.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.408
Thank you, Martha, that would be lovely.

49:42.283 --> 49:43.492
Thank you, Martha.

50:01.407 --> 50:02.949
Is there anything else I can get you?

50:03.241 --> 50:05.157
No, thank you, Martha, this is lovely.

50:08.282 --> 50:10.741
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.323
A clever and well-bred woman, your wife.

50:31.531 --> 50:33.448
You did well for yourself, Captain.

50:38.406 --> 50:42.906
Word has it that you had Charlie Burns

50:44.615 --> 50:45.948
and you let him go.

50:47.323 --> 50:51.989
Word has it
that you offered him some kind of deal.

50:52.530 --> 50:54.322
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

50:55.364 --> 50:56.780
Word has it

50:56.864 --> 51:00.989
that you promised those animals
who raped Eliza Hopkins a pardon

51:01.072 --> 51:03.239
if Charlie Burns brought back his brother.

51:03.364 --> 51:06.197
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family!

51:06.739 --> 51:09.030
Are you completely out of your mind?

51:09.697 --> 51:10.822
Listen to me.

51:10.905 --> 51:12.530
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

51:12.614 --> 51:14.947
He spends all day in his cell
crying like a child.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.279
It is my belief that he is not
responsible for his actions.

51:18.363 --> 51:21.238
I'm not interested
in your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.446
Who do you think you are,
the judge and the jury?

51:23.529 --> 51:25.279
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

51:25.654 --> 51:28.779
It is he who is responsible for this outrage.

51:29.071 --> 51:32.821
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

51:32.988 --> 51:35.279
to protect his younger brother, Mike.

51:37.613 --> 51:39.446
So all we need do now is wait.

51:40.363 --> 51:41.613
Wait?

51:41.821 --> 51:43.696
My God, man, they raped a woman!

51:44.404 --> 51:47.237
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

51:51.028 --> 51:53.278
As I said, 100 lashes.

51:53.362 --> 51:55.278
- This will kill him.
- So be it.

51:55.403 --> 51:56.737
What if I'm right?

51:57.820 --> 52:00.612
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?

52:00.695 --> 52:02.112
What if he comes back?

52:02.278 --> 52:04.112
Then we will hang the lot of them.

52:08.195 --> 52:09.612
Good day.

52:22.152 --> 52:23.236
Martha.

52:25.027 --> 52:27.027
Martha, stay here.

52:27.111 --> 52:29.944
Do not let anyone in.
I shall return tomorrow.

52:31.402 --> 52:33.527
Martha! Do you hear me?

52:34.027 --> 52:35.611
Please. Stay here.

53:26.817 --> 53:28.609
What's going on in here?

53:31.317 --> 53:34.692
Well, I believe Officer Davenport
and Officer Matthews

53:34.775 --> 53:36.234
have been entertaining the prisoner, sir.

53:36.317 --> 53:38.316
- Is that right, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

53:38.399 --> 53:39.899
- Well, I've got a job for you.
- Yes, sir.

53:39.983 --> 53:42.233
You have unfinished business
in the Arooka Ranges.

53:42.983 --> 53:44.108
Sir?

53:44.191 --> 53:45.733
Rebel blacks, Sergeant.

53:46.233 --> 53:49.524
Within two hours, you must find Jacko

53:49.941 --> 53:52.108
and recruit some more troopers,

53:52.816 --> 53:53.899
and depart.

53:59.233 --> 54:00.733
Fucking snake.

54:03.858 --> 54:05.315
Why are you still standing there?

54:07.565 --> 54:09.107
You've been dismissed.

54:18.482 --> 54:20.523
Where's Charlie, Mr Stanley?

54:22.648 --> 54:25.732
I don't know, son. I don't know.

54:37.481 --> 54:38.814
Captain?

54:56.689 --> 54:57.939
Captain.

55:12.355 --> 55:14.688
Bring him out, Stanley!

55:30.520 --> 55:33.937
- Michael Burns.
- Who?

55:34.020 --> 55:36.562
Let's see him, Stanley!

55:40.020 --> 55:42.187
Give him to us, Stanley!

55:46.937 --> 55:48.270
Bring him out, Stanley.

55:49.020 --> 55:50.270
Stand aside, Stanley.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.062
We want justice.

56:00.603 --> 56:06.228
I'll shoot the first person
who lays hands on Mike Burns.

56:07.019 --> 56:08.728
Give him to us.

56:19.519 --> 56:23.728
You heard me.
You move, I'll shoot you dead.

56:24.643 --> 56:27.268
Are you going to shoot your wife
as well, Captain?

56:32.977 --> 56:34.393
Martha?

56:34.477 --> 56:37.685
She was with child, for God's sake.

56:38.227 --> 56:41.352
Martha, if this flogging goes ahead,

56:45.268 --> 56:47.643
it will be our death sentence.

56:47.893 --> 56:49.477
What if it had been me?

57:10.892 --> 57:13.517
- Come on, you bastard.
- Captain Stanley?

57:13.767 --> 57:16.226
- Help me!
- Get up, Mikey!

57:16.309 --> 57:18.226
Get up for your bloody whooping!

57:19.767 --> 57:20.850
Come on!

57:21.100 --> 57:22.183
Go back!

57:23.766 --> 57:27.600
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Stay still!

57:27.766 --> 57:29.141
My good people,

57:31.225 --> 57:32.725
before you stands

57:33.725 --> 57:34.891
one of the vilest,

57:36.183 --> 57:39.975
most bloodthirsty villains
this country has ever seen.

57:40.433 --> 57:41.766
Rapist,

57:42.141 --> 57:43.225
looter,

57:43.558 --> 57:44.641
murderer.

57:44.725 --> 57:48.058
His crimes are of the most heinous kind.

57:48.557 --> 57:51.057
Before the year is out, this man will hang.

57:51.432 --> 57:53.224
Today, he will be flogged.

57:53.307 --> 57:58.265
A message to all
who dare transgress the laws of this land.

57:58.474 --> 57:59.682
One hundred lashes.

58:00.474 --> 58:01.557
Proceed.

58:01.640 --> 58:02.890
One!

58:02.974 --> 58:04.057
Captain, please!

58:05.474 --> 58:06.599
Two!

58:09.807 --> 58:10.932
Three!

58:11.099 --> 58:12.265
Please!

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.094
He could shame a nightingale.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:46.843
Thirty-eight.

01:00:49.509 --> 01:00:50.634
Thirty-nine.

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:55.759
Go on.

01:01:25.467 --> 01:01:27.758
Your days are over, Captain Stanley.

01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:42.674
Martha, come on.

01:03:29.045 --> 01:03:30.545
Martha, you must eat.

01:03:31.628 --> 01:03:33.712
Tobey's made you some soup.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.003
Here you go.

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:56.669
This is good.

01:04:06.586 --> 01:04:08.627
You must eat something, Martha, please.

01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:13.377
No.

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:18.877
No.

01:04:31.126 --> 01:04:32.460
I'm so sorry.

01:04:35.043 --> 01:04:36.668
Forgive me, please.

01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:38.751
I just wanted to protect you.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.126
I had an idea about justice, and...

01:04:44.668 --> 01:04:46.376
For the town, for the country.

01:04:47.959 --> 01:04:49.167
For you.

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:51.959
For you.

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.042
And now,

01:04:58.584 --> 01:04:59.917
I don't know.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.584
Hey, quit pissing down me leg.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.167
Well, find your own fucking tree!

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:08.375
What do you need a fucking tree for?
Just piss on Daniel, not on me!

01:05:08.459 --> 01:05:10.542
Fuck off! Don't piss on me, you idiot!

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:13.459
Strange mob, you whities.

01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:22.374
Good news.

01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:24.374
Sergeant Lawrie?

01:05:26.624 --> 01:05:28.124
- Over there.
- What?

01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:30.624
Where?

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:31.958
See it?

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:34.874
Hard to see it.

01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.374
At foot of the Ranges.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:39.458
Well, I can't see a bloody thing.

01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:40.958
There!

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.624
What?

01:05:45.748 --> 01:05:46.832
Smoke.

01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:05.915
Love.

01:06:07.582 --> 01:06:08.998
Love is the key.

01:06:11.248 --> 01:06:12.956
Love and family.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.664
For what are night and day,

01:06:19.081 --> 01:06:22.456
the sun, the moon, the stars,

01:06:22.872 --> 01:06:24.497
without love

01:06:25.914 --> 01:06:27.831
and those you love around you?

01:06:30.872 --> 01:06:33.331
What could be more hollow

01:06:34.497 --> 01:06:35.956
than to die alone,

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:38.664
unloved?

01:06:39.247 --> 01:06:40.580
What the fuck was that?

01:06:41.246 --> 01:06:44.038
Fucking trooper's rifle. Four-fiftys.

01:06:44.538 --> 01:06:46.496
- Shooting blacks.
- Be calm, Samuel.

01:06:47.455 --> 01:06:49.246
The shots are miles away.

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.243
Burn it!

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.493
Burn the fucking lot!

01:08:21.577 --> 01:08:22.827
Don't stand there moping.

01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:26.493
What are you doing?

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:28.660
Burn everything!

01:08:35.742 --> 01:08:37.783
Molly O'Boyle, my arse.

01:09:12.116 --> 01:09:15.450
Who the fuck left Danny-boy out in the sun?

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.866
Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.116
I told you to bury that bastard last night.

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:30.282
He stinks worse than you.

01:09:30.865 --> 01:09:32.323
Jacko!

01:09:34.657 --> 01:09:37.407
You got the wrong fucking black man.

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.532
Slowly, now, Sergeant.

01:09:40.198 --> 01:09:43.032
Put your privates back in your pants
and turn around.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.240
Come to steal my brother a horse,

01:09:49.407 --> 01:09:50.657
and we find ourselves a copper.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.198
You fire that gun,
you'll have eight more all over you.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:55.656
Fair enough.

01:10:00.406 --> 01:10:04.406
Step into the shade, Sergeant. To the back.

01:10:13.698 --> 01:10:15.406
Has Charlie found you, then?

01:10:15.906 --> 01:10:17.614
Stanley's little mate.

01:10:17.698 --> 01:10:19.114
Over there.

01:10:20.323 --> 01:10:21.614
By the straw.

01:10:21.864 --> 01:10:24.197
Good boy. That's right, stay.

01:10:24.405 --> 01:10:25.947
Lay down, Sergeant.

01:10:27.655 --> 01:10:29.322
Move. Right now. Come here.

01:10:29.405 --> 01:10:31.780
I know something you don't know.

01:10:33.572 --> 01:10:35.572
Now, Sergeant,

01:10:35.655 --> 01:10:36.905
what?

01:10:37.488 --> 01:10:39.530
Your brother's come to kill you.

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:42.988
- I can help.
- You can help me?

01:10:50.488 --> 01:10:53.612
Help your fucking self!

01:10:55.487 --> 01:10:56.571
Copper.

01:11:06.196 --> 01:11:07.904
Here's your knife back, you dog.

01:11:19.361 --> 01:11:20.778
There's something I want to tell you.

01:11:24.528 --> 01:11:27.528
I've been having a dream. Most nights.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.403
I've kept it from you.

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.320
But I don't suppose it matters now.

01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:35.820
I'm in a room.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:38.736
It's our bedroom, I think.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.445
And I'm searching for something.

01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:47.902
And then suddenly,
I feel a presence in the room.

01:11:48.819 --> 01:11:51.444
And I stand up, and I turn around,

01:11:52.902 --> 01:11:55.527
and there in the doorway is Eliza Hopkins.

01:11:56.735 --> 01:11:58.277
And she looks frightful.

01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:04.152
Her dress is all creased and torn

01:12:04.902 --> 01:12:07.319
and covered in blood, and her face, too.

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:12.069
All battered and bruised,
and splashed with blood.

01:12:12.152 --> 01:12:14.985
- Martha.
- But listen to this.

01:12:15.068 --> 01:12:18.026
In her arms, she's holding something.

01:12:19.984 --> 01:12:21.734
I can't see what it is

01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:25.693
because it's covered by her hair.

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:29.234
And then she walks towards me,

01:12:30.859 --> 01:12:32.359
very slowly.

01:12:34.859 --> 01:12:35.943
Then

01:12:37.943 --> 01:12:40.359
she hands me a tiny bundle.

01:12:43.733 --> 01:12:45.567
And I look down,

01:12:47.733 --> 01:12:50.067
and I see that it's a baby,

01:12:52.275 --> 01:12:53.775
a newborn.

01:12:55.983 --> 01:12:59.275
And this baby...
Oh, it's a beautiful baby, Morris.

01:13:01.483 --> 01:13:05.067
And it opens its eyes,

01:13:05.858 --> 01:13:06.983
and then

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:10.525
I feel a pressure on my hand,
and I look down,

01:13:10.608 --> 01:13:15.316
and I see that the baby has
taken hold of my finger

01:13:15.399 --> 01:13:18.482
and it's squeezing it tight in its tiny fist.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.191
And then I wake up.

01:13:33.066 --> 01:13:37.691
But after I wake, it's the strangest thing.

01:13:38.066 --> 01:13:43.815
I can still feel the pressure
of that dream baby's hand

01:13:45.023 --> 01:13:46.440
on my finger.

01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:52.065
What do you think of that?

01:14:07.939 --> 01:14:09.189
Good boy!

01:14:10.064 --> 01:14:12.189
Nice and tight, eh?

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.564
Right.

01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:17.105
Up we get!

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.105
No, I wouldn't try that if I were you.

01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:24.772
Ligatures and knots
are one of my many talents.

01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:28.064
Right.

01:14:30.897 --> 01:14:35.854
And it appears that you are singularly bereft
in any talents whatsoever, Mr Burns.

01:14:39.646 --> 01:14:42.146
To be speared by a savage?

01:14:42.313 --> 01:14:44.771
How extraordinarily quaint!

01:14:46.771 --> 01:14:49.771
Easy, Mr Burns.

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:56.396
I was drunk.
You only got me because I was drunk.

01:14:57.188 --> 01:15:00.729
Well, I'm not drunk now. I'm on the job now.

01:15:02.646 --> 01:15:04.895
Not a bad day's work, either.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:09.228
For what is an Irishman
but a nigger turned inside out?

01:15:09.603 --> 01:15:14.437
Now, we're going to sit down

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.937
on this log.

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:19.228
Nice and easy, Mr Burns.

01:15:20.353 --> 01:15:21.478
There!

01:15:40.727 --> 01:15:43.852
I really should stop saving your life,
brother Charlie,

01:15:47.227 --> 01:15:48.394
all things considered.

01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:51.644
"There's night and day, brother

01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:55.144
"Both sweet things

01:15:55.852 --> 01:16:01.101
"The sun and the moon and the stars
are all sweet things

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.935
"Likewise,

01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:08.518
"there's a wind on the heath

01:16:09.476 --> 01:16:15.518
"Life is very sweet, brother..."

01:16:16.643 --> 01:16:20.810
"'Life is very sweet, brother

01:16:21.768 --> 01:16:25.101
"Who would wish to die?"

01:16:27.267 --> 01:16:29.267
George Borrow, I believe.

01:16:30.392 --> 01:16:34.059
A worthy writer,
and a beautiful sentiment, sir.

01:16:36.475 --> 01:16:38.475
But you're not my brother.

01:16:49.475 --> 01:16:50.850
Finish him.

01:16:53.267 --> 01:16:54.517
Oh, dear.

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:00.891
This may hurt.

01:17:30.473 --> 01:17:33.598
Why can't you ever just stop me?

01:17:39.557 --> 01:17:41.848
They're hanging Mikey come Christmas Day.

01:17:44.473 --> 01:17:45.765
When's Christmas, Charlie?

01:17:46.348 --> 01:17:48.807
- I have some riding to do.
- Brother!

01:18:07.472 --> 01:18:08.764
Where did you get it?

01:18:08.972 --> 01:18:10.431
I'm a very resourceful woman.

01:18:10.514 --> 01:18:12.431
I never doubted it for a moment.

01:18:12.514 --> 01:18:15.347
- Look real good, Missus.
- Thank you, Tobey.

01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:17.597
And...

01:18:30.513 --> 01:18:31.596
And look.

01:18:39.055 --> 01:18:40.221
Snow.

01:18:47.887 --> 01:18:49.679
"Ho, ho, ho!"

01:18:49.762 --> 01:18:51.179
Ho, ho, ho.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.929
- Who is it?
- Dr Bantrey.

01:19:03.887 --> 01:19:04.970
Are you alone?

01:19:05.804 --> 01:19:06.929
Yes.

01:19:09.637 --> 01:19:11.095
Then you may come in.

01:19:17.469 --> 01:19:20.594
It doesn't look good, Morris.
The boy is dying.

01:19:22.219 --> 01:19:25.594
Nothing that I can do.

01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:30.761
It sure is pretty.

01:19:32.303 --> 01:19:33.803
You can never
get your fill of nature, Samuel.

01:19:33.886 --> 01:19:36.303
To be surrounded by it is to be stilled.

01:19:36.594 --> 01:19:38.011
It salves the heart.

01:19:38.094 --> 01:19:41.886
The mountains,
the trees, the endless plains.

01:19:42.428 --> 01:19:44.343
The moon, the myriad of stars.

01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:47.052
Every man can be made quiet and complete.

01:19:47.468 --> 01:19:50.927
Even the lowliest misanthrope
or the most wretched of sinners.

01:19:51.552 --> 01:19:53.468
What's a misanthrope, Arthur?

01:19:53.968 --> 01:19:56.510
Some bugger
who fucking hates every other bugger.

01:19:56.635 --> 01:19:58.843
Hey! I didn't ask you, you black bastard.

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:02.010
He's right, Samuel.
A misanthrope is one who hates humanity.

01:20:03.718 --> 01:20:06.260
Is that what we are? Misanthropes?

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:08.760
Good lord, no. We're a family.

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:35.717
<i>"Adieu," said the bird in the branch of a tree</i>

01:20:37.092 --> 01:20:41.925
<i>"Farewell," said the snake to the dying light</i>

01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:47.800
<i>"Adieu," said the fish in the river of sleep</i>

01:20:49.216 --> 01:20:53.966
<i>"Goodbye," said the rider
"Goodbye and good night"</i>

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.133
<i>"No," said the stars to the moon and the sky</i>

01:21:00.425 --> 01:21:03.050
<i>"No," said the trees that started to moan</i>

01:21:07.132 --> 01:21:10.007
<i>"No," said the dust that blinded his eyes</i>

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:12.924
<i>"Yes," said the rider and pointed his gun</i>

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:23.090
Best you go now, Tobey.

01:21:34.881 --> 01:21:36.298
Tobey.

01:21:39.381 --> 01:21:40.464
Merry Christmas.

01:21:50.548 --> 01:21:52.173
Merry Christmas, Captain.

01:22:23.297 --> 01:22:25.338
Prisoner coming through!

01:22:27.713 --> 01:22:29.338
Prisoner coming through!

01:22:29.422 --> 01:22:32.712
Stand back, ladies and gentlemen,
this black fellow bites!

01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:35.087
Keep moving,
you murdering bloody bastard!

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:36.837
'Tis the jailhouse for you!

01:22:36.921 --> 01:22:40.046
You led us a merry,
bloody dance for many days.

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:43.254
But, alas for you, you dirty mongrel,
we've got you.

01:22:43.462 --> 01:22:44.754
How am I doing?

01:22:45.212 --> 01:22:47.462
You're doing just fine, Sergeant Stoat.

01:22:50.587 --> 01:22:52.837
Keep moving, you dusty devil! Don't lag!

01:22:53.712 --> 01:22:56.962
And keep your lustful eyes
to the ground, you lecherous dog,

01:22:57.046 --> 01:22:59.836
or I'll whip the filthy black hide
right off you!

01:23:01.128 --> 01:23:02.503
Good morning, miss.

01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:24.503
What's happened?

01:23:24.753 --> 01:23:25.836
I don't know.

01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:28.585
It must be some of Lawrence's lot.

01:23:29.044 --> 01:23:32.752
- Go! Fast!
- Holy shit! Oh, God!

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:37.877
Mikey. Mikey!

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.502
- Hey! This one's pissed himself!
- No!

01:23:40.794 --> 01:23:42.669
Where are the keys, you bastards?

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.627
Give me the fucking keys!

01:23:48.127 --> 01:23:51.252
Please! Don't hurt me! Please!

01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:52.877
Mikey!

01:23:55.043 --> 01:23:56.126
Mikey!

01:23:56.376 --> 01:23:57.918
Mikey, it's all right.

01:23:58.001 --> 01:23:59.751
Will you shut him up, Charlie?

01:23:59.959 --> 01:24:01.709
Mikey! Mikey! Mikey!

01:24:01.876 --> 01:24:03.418
It's Charlie!

01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:04.584
Two Bob.

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:10.126
- I think the job is fucking done.
- Two Bob, you fucking yellow dog!

01:24:10.334 --> 01:24:12.459
Come on, fucking bitches, in you go!

01:24:12.793 --> 01:24:14.418
- Arthur?
- Arthur!

01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:17.834
I'll see you at the good Captain's.
We'll save the best till last.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:24.917
Get!

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.500
Stand back!

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:28.333
Get!

01:25:41.581 --> 01:25:43.206
You look grand, Samuel.

01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:49.372
Well, we're going visiting.

01:25:49.455 --> 01:25:50.664
That's right.

01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:20.452
It's all your fault, Charlie.
You should never have left us.

01:27:37.494 --> 01:27:39.576
- Would you like me to carve?
- No. No, no, no.

01:27:39.951 --> 01:27:41.076
I'll carve.

01:28:03.993 --> 01:28:05.867
Finest bird I ever had, Mum.

01:28:06.075 --> 01:28:08.159
Made with me own fair hands.

01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:41.283
Thank you.

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:08.032
For what we are about to receive,

01:29:08.782 --> 01:29:10.573
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

01:29:10.657 --> 01:29:12.157
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:29:14.865 --> 01:29:16.115
Merry Christmas.

01:29:18.365 --> 01:29:19.865
Merry Christmas.

01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:49.406
Guard the woman, Samuel.

01:29:50.614 --> 01:29:51.781
Shit!

01:30:07.946 --> 01:30:09.821
Move out of your seat again, ma'am,

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.905
and I'll stick this fork
through your fucking eye.

01:30:14.946 --> 01:30:16.071
Shut up.

01:30:16.738 --> 01:30:18.655
I said, shut up.

01:30:43.112 --> 01:30:44.445
It's Christmas.

01:31:12.736 --> 01:31:14.111
What does that say?

01:31:26.277 --> 01:31:27.818
"To my darling wife,

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.652
"whom I love so much.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:32.277
"I'm sorry."

01:31:34.985 --> 01:31:36.402
Sorry for what?

01:31:52.692 --> 01:31:55.609
Oh, ma'am, they're beautiful.

01:31:56.442 --> 01:31:58.109
Never seen anything so beautiful.

01:31:58.192 --> 01:31:59.859
- Samuel!
- That's us.

01:32:00.859 --> 01:32:01.942
Get up.

01:32:22.191 --> 01:32:24.108
You won't want to miss this, Captain.

01:32:58.190 --> 01:33:01.190
<i>Samuel, sing us Peggy Gordon.</i>

01:33:19.606 --> 01:33:22.189
Charlie. Just in time.

01:33:23.606 --> 01:33:25.064
Mikey's dead.

01:33:27.939 --> 01:33:29.231
Listen to that.

01:33:29.481 --> 01:33:30.606
He sings like a bird.

01:33:52.605 --> 01:33:54.355
Not the gut, Charlie.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.605
Shit.

01:34:02.438 --> 01:34:03.563
No more.

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:52.561
I'm going to be with me brother.

01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:04.892
You got me, Charlie.

01:36:15.017 --> 01:36:16.683
What are you going to do now?
