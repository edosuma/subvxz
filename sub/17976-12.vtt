11:14.833 --> 11:16.667
I DON'T EXPECT

11:16.700 --> 11:18.167
THAT IT WOULD
FIX EVERYTHING.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.300
LIKE YOU CAN BUY ME OFF
WITH MONEY AND GOOD DEEDS,

11:21.333 --> 11:24.067
LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF A WHORE.

11:24.067 --> 11:27.533
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

11:30.833 --> 11:31.733
[BETTE]:
I WAS PLANNING

11:31.767 --> 11:33.133
ON COMING IN
THIS AFTERNOON,

11:33.167 --> 11:34.433
BUT HE JUST SEEMED
A LITTLE DISORIENTED,

11:34.467 --> 11:36.067
SO I JUST DIDN'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.067
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING,
BETTE.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.333
AFTER THIS WEEK,

11:39.367 --> 11:40.633
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET BACK

11:40.667 --> 11:44.067
TO SOME SEMBLANCE
OF A NORMAL SCHEDULE.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.067
LISTEN, WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL PRESSURED.

11:46.067 --> 11:47.667
YOU TAKE
HOWEVER MUCH TIME YOU NEED.

11:49.633 --> 11:50.667
THANK YOU.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.067
I APPRECIATE THAT.

11:52.100 --> 11:56.433
WE JUST NEED TO PUT
SOME STRUCTURE IN PLACE.

11:56.467 --> 12:00.600
I'M SURE THE BOARD WOULD SUPPORT
A TEMPORARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.800
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE?

12:04.833 --> 12:07.367
WHAT ABOUT
THE ALAN BARNES RETROSPECTIVE?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.067
WELL, WE HAVE LEO.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.633
THINGS WON'T TOTALLY FALL APART
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.067
I HIRED A NURSE.

12:13.067 --> 12:16.067
I WASN'T PLANNING
ON TAKING A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.733
I'M SURE THAT AS SOON
AS HE TRUSTS HER--

12:17.767 --> 12:19.333
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT,

12:19.367 --> 12:20.367
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.367
I'M SORRY.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.500
EXCUSE ME, JUST...

12:22.533 --> 12:25.467
SURE.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.133
SO WE HAVE TO DO THIS
EVERY FEW HOURS.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.167
JUST TAKE HIS SHOULDER GENTLY,
UNDER HERE, LIKE THAT.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.133
IS THAT OKAY?

12:32.167 --> 12:34.367
[GROANS]

12:34.400 --> 12:36.533
I'M SORRY.

12:36.567 --> 12:37.700
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.333
JUST ONE SECOND.

12:49.433 --> 12:52.067
YOUR FATHER'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU,
BETTE.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.733
THANKS.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.600
JUST LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.700
ABOUT WHAT?

12:58.733 --> 13:01.533
ABOUT THE LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

13:01.567 --> 13:05.467
CAN I HAVE UNTIL MONDAY
TO DECIDE?

13:05.500 --> 13:06.600
OF COURSE.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.067
TAKE THE WEEKEND.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.633
[***]

13:18.667 --> 13:20.067
ASK LARA TO--

13:20.067 --> 13:22.767
IT IS LARA, ISN'T IT?
YOUR CHEF?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.100
YEAH.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.233
ASK LARA TO BRING US

13:25.267 --> 13:26.300
A SELECTION
OF SMALL TASTES,

13:26.333 --> 13:28.967
WHATEVER SHE THINKS
IS MOST DELICIOUS.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.067
YOUR CHEF.
THAT'S NICE.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.133
WOW.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.667
THIS IS MY FAVORITE
WAY TO EAT.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.700
YOU SHOULD STICK WITH ME, THEN.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.300
ALICE, IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO GO OUT WITH HER, JUST--

13:37.333 --> 13:38.433
I SAID IT WAS OKAY.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.833
I'M A SURVEILLANCE
PHOTOGRAPHER.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.100
I WORK
FOR DIVORCE LAWYERS,

13:42.133 --> 13:43.300
WIVES TRYING TO FIND
THEIR HUSBANDS

13:43.333 --> 13:44.300
CHEATING ON THEM,

13:44.333 --> 13:45.300
THAT KIND OF THING.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.300
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.433
I SHOULD BRING YOU
WITH ME TO NEW YORK.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.767
YOU CAN SPY ON MY EX.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.967
[BOTH LAUGH]

13:53.067 --> 13:54.300
I'M GOING TO GO.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.567
WHY?

13:55.600 --> 13:56.967
WE HAVEN'T EVEN EATEN.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.367
I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN,
BUT PLEASE STAY.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.167
I'LL TAKE A CAB.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.500
YOU OKAY?

14:03.533 --> 14:06.600
BESIDES HAVING TO PEE
LIKE A HORSE?

14:06.633 --> 14:08.067
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.467
HELENA, I'M TIRED.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.367
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME
AND BE ALONE.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
FINE.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.133
ENJOY BEING ALONE.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.700
I WILL.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.533
I WANT TO ENJOY IT WHILE I CAN.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.633
BYE, GUYS.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.833
OKAY, I'LL
SEE YOU LATER.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.633
BYE.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.433
DANA...

14:32.633 --> 14:34.567
[WHISPERING]:
YOU WON'T BE ALONE,

14:34.600 --> 14:36.267
BUT YOU'LL STILL GET LONELY.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.167
[BETTE]:
"I LOOKED UPON THE NILE

14:44.200 --> 14:45.867
"AND RAISED THE PYRAMIDS
ABOVE IT.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.533
"I HEARD THE SINGING
OF THE MISSISSIPPI

"WHEN ABE LINCOLN
WENT DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS,

14:51.300 --> 14:54.833
AND I'VE SEEN ITS MUDDY BOSOM
TURN ALL GOLDEN IN THE SUNSET."

14:58.567 --> 15:02.733
"I'VE KNOWN RIVERS,
ANCIENT, DUSKY RIVERS.

15:02.767 --> 15:07.333
MY SOUL HAS GROWN DEEP,
LIKE THE RIVERS."

15:15.867 --> 15:17.767
DADDY,
IT'S TIME TO TURN YOU OVER.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.067
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY
TO DO THIS BY MYSELF, OKAY?

15:21.067 --> 15:22.067
I'M JUST GOING TO
LIFT UP...

15:22.100 --> 15:24.900
LET ME HELP YOU.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.267
IF YOU COULD JUST...

15:27.300 --> 15:29.067
TAKE THE PILLOW...

15:30.733 --> 15:34.567
AND I'LL HOLD HIS SHOULDER HERE.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.733
KIT MADE YOU DINNER.

15:35.767 --> 15:36.733
I PROMISED HER

15:36.767 --> 15:39.133
I'D MAKE YOU
SIT DOWN AND EAT IT.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.700
THAT'S GOOD.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.933
HELLO, MELVIN.

15:53.967 --> 15:56.900
IT'S TINA.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.967
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.433
KIT'S AT WORK.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.067
SHE'LL BE HERE
AS SOON AS SHE CAN.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.433
WHO?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.667
KATIE, DADDY.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.067
SHE SAID SHE'S
GOING TO BE HERE SOON.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.533
HOW DOES SHE KNOW KATIE?

16:18.133 --> 16:20.233
I'M GOING TO GO GET YOU
A GLASS OF WATER.

16:20.267 --> 16:21.600
OKAY?

16:21.633 --> 16:24.167
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.067
I'LL FIX YOU DINNER.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.467
I'M SORRY...

16:44.500 --> 16:47.167
IF I WAS SELFISH
THE OTHER NIGHT.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.833
IT'S OKAY.

16:56.333 --> 17:00.533
I PUT HIM IN
THE LIVING ROOM.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.633
I DIDN'T
WANT TO PUT HIM

17:01.667 --> 17:02.967
IN THE BABY'S ROOM,

17:03.067 --> 17:05.100
IN CASE...

17:17.567 --> 17:20.367
WE'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

I'VE NEVER HELD YOU...

17:22.700 --> 17:25.133
IN FRONT OF MY FATHER.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.467
HE'S ASLEEP.

NOW, THAT'S

17:33.500 --> 17:35.367
WHAT I LIKE TO SEE.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.067
NOW, PROMISE...

17:37.067 --> 17:41.300
YOU'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY GIRL.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.067
I PROMISE.

DON'T RUN AWAY AGAIN.

LITTLE GIRL.

18:14.100 --> 18:20.433
I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN,
MAXINE.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.067
I WAS WEAK.

WHAT TIME
DID YOU GET HERE?

22:58.700 --> 23:01.067
A LITTLE
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.433
HE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.567
HE WAS AWAKE,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.100
BUT HE DIDN'T TALK.

23:08.133 --> 23:10.167
HE WAS IN
SO MUCH PAIN.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.467
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S GIVING UP.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.867
SHELLY'S GOING TO BE HERE
IN AN HOUR.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.133
SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO GIVE HIM

23:26.167 --> 23:27.167
A SPONGE BATH
THIS MORNING.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.167
NO, SHE WILL NOT.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.467
THAT'S AN INDIGNITY

23:29.500 --> 23:31.067
I AM NOT PREPARED
TO ENDURE.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.233
DADDY...

23:32.267 --> 23:35.200
YOU CAN HELP ME
TO THE BATHROOM.

23:35.233 --> 23:39.133
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF BATHING MYSELF...

23:39.167 --> 23:40.333
WHICH YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE ABLE TO DO

23:40.367 --> 23:41.300
THESE DAYS.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.133
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
OUT OF THOSE CLOTHES

23:43.167 --> 23:45.800
SINCE I FIRST ARRIVED.

23:45.833 --> 23:48.667
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF YOU, DADDY.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.067
TO THE DETRIMENT OF YOUR WORK,

23:51.100 --> 23:53.700
AND WHAT'S ALL THIS

23:53.733 --> 23:55.300
ABOUT TAKING
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE?

23:55.333 --> 23:56.967
I'M CONSIDERING IT.

23:57.067 --> 23:59.767
SO YOU CAN MOPE AROUND HERE
AND WATCH AN OLD MAN DIE?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.167
I WILL NOT HAVE IT.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.267
YOUR WORK IS TOO
IMPORTANT FOR THAT.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.067
IT'S NOT MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOU.

24:06.067 --> 24:08.333
I DON'T WANT
EITHER OF YOU

24:08.367 --> 24:10.167
TO COMPROMISE
YOUR CAREERS

24:10.200 --> 24:11.933
ON MY BEHALF.

24:11.967 --> 24:14.267
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

24:14.300 --> 24:15.967
YEAH.

24:16.067 --> 24:17.300
AND YOU.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.467
IF YOU THINK BENJAMIN

24:18.500 --> 24:20.533
IS GOING TO LEAVE
HIS FAMILY FOR YOU--

24:20.567 --> 24:21.767
I DON'T, DADDY.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.833
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T?

24:23.867 --> 24:26.700
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
TO ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.500
IT'S HUMAN NATURE
TO PURSUE ONE'S HAPPINESS

24:29.533 --> 24:30.833
OVER SOMEONE ELSE'S MISERY.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.267
NOT ALWAYS, DADDY.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.567
AFTER HER MOTHER
STOLE YOU FROM MY MOTHER,

24:33.600 --> 24:35.433
YOU FELL IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, DIDN'T YOU?

24:35.467 --> 24:37.200
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

24:39.467 --> 24:41.067
OH, UM...

24:41.067 --> 24:42.100
I'M SORRY.

24:42.133 --> 24:43.467
HELLO, TINA.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.400
HELLO, MELVIN.

24:46.433 --> 24:47.733
WHERE'S MY NURSE?

24:47.767 --> 24:51.400
