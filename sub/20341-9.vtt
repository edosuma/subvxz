(Bingo and Rolly speak)

01:05.750 --> 01:07.000
Come on, you guys.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.875
Let's take a look
at my special calendar

01:08.875 --> 01:10.625
and see what's happening today.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.458
I can't wait to see
what's happening today.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.000
Especially 'cause you and I
are always happening.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.375
Bingo:
There we are!

01:16.375 --> 01:17.166
Rolly:
Looking good!

01:18.416 --> 01:20.291
Oh! Today's the big parade

01:20.291 --> 01:22.208
right through
the center of town.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.958
Oh-ho! I designed
a special balloon for it
and everything.

01:25.958 --> 01:27.875
Ooh, I love balloons!

01:27.875 --> 01:30.083
Especially
specially designed ones.

01:30.083 --> 01:33.416
Except I won't be able
to see it.

01:33.416 --> 01:35.708
Well, that calls
for a... "What?"

01:35.708 --> 01:37.833
I need to come up
with a new invention

01:37.833 --> 01:41.458
and I'm gonna be working
at my desk upstairs
until I invent it,

01:41.458 --> 01:44.166
which means that everything
I love about a parade--

01:44.166 --> 01:47.291
all the marching
and the music and the noise...

01:48.375 --> 01:49.458
I'm gonna miss it.

01:51.291 --> 01:52.583
Well, I'll see you guys

01:52.583 --> 01:54.208
after I invent something,

01:54.208 --> 01:55.375
as soon as I figure out

01:55.375 --> 01:56.583
something to invent.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.375
I feel bad for Bob.

02:00.375 --> 02:01.500
He'll be standing up there

02:01.500 --> 02:03.333
all day long not being able

02:03.333 --> 02:04.291
to go see the parade.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.708
It's too bad he can't just

02:05.708 --> 02:07.291
just see the parade
from the house.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.250
Rolly, that's a great idea!

02:09.250 --> 02:10.458
It is?

02:10.458 --> 02:12.625
You're gonna have
to tell me what
that great idea is.

02:12.625 --> 02:14.875
We could put together
a different parade

02:14.875 --> 02:16.416
and bring it right by the house.

02:16.416 --> 02:19.250
That way Bob can see it
when he looks outside.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.375
(gasps) That sounds like
it could be our mission!

02:21.375 --> 02:24.208
That is our mission,
so let's go!

02:24.208 --> 02:25.458
Wanna come with us, Hissy?

02:25.458 --> 02:28.000
We're gonna go find some noise
and music and marching for Bob!

02:28.000 --> 02:30.375
No thanks,
my calendar's pretty full.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.208
I've got a big nap planned

02:32.208 --> 02:34.500
from now until... dinner.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.375

02:59.166 --> 03:00.833

-(both laughing)

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Remember everything
that Bob said he liked
about a parade?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.375
Let's see,
he likes marching and music

03:19.375 --> 03:20.708
and noise.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.416
So we'll start with
the first one.

03:22.416 --> 03:23.958
We need to find
something that marches

03:23.958 --> 03:25.375
and bring it to Bob.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.416
Something that marches,
something that marches...

03:27.416 --> 03:29.416
Woman:
All right, children, line up.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.458
Back to the classroom we go.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.000
Bow to the wow,
they're marching!

03:34.000 --> 03:36.375
Yeah! If we can get them
to follow us home

03:36.375 --> 03:38.166
and march past Bob's house,

03:38.166 --> 03:40.250
he can see a parade
like he wants!

03:40.250 --> 03:42.375
But how are we gonna
get them to follow us home?

03:42.375 --> 03:44.333
I guess we could
just ask them.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.875
Could all of you
maybe follow us
back to our house?

03:48.875 --> 03:50.583
-Puppies!
-(giggling)

03:50.583 --> 03:52.833
Come on, children!
Back in line!

03:52.833 --> 03:55.500
-And follow us!
-Forward, march!

03:55.500 --> 03:57.375
Both:
March, two, three, four.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.250
March, two, three, four.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.458
Where'd they go?
Our parade marched off
without us.

04:03.458 --> 04:04.583
So we'll have to find

04:04.583 --> 04:06.875
something else that Bob
likes about a parade

04:06.875 --> 04:08.375
and take that to him instead.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.500
Something that makes
either music or noise.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.083
And I know where
to find both!

04:12.083 --> 04:13.333
Come on, Rolly.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.291
Both:
March, two, three four!

04:15.291 --> 04:17.500
March, two, three. Stop!

04:17.500 --> 04:18.708
A music store,

04:18.708 --> 04:20.625
with all kinds of stuff
that makes noise and music!

04:20.625 --> 04:22.708
We should figure out
which is the noisiest one

04:22.708 --> 04:24.458
and take it back
to be in Bob's parade.

04:28.583 --> 04:31.458
Hmm... it could be
that one, or that one.

04:32.458 --> 04:35.166
-Maybe it's-- Ah!
-(horn blows)

04:35.166 --> 04:36.875
This one's pretty noisy.

04:36.875 --> 04:37.958
So I've heard.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.583
But that one looks
even noisier!

04:41.583 --> 04:43.708
Drums are super noisy,

04:43.708 --> 04:45.833
except I don't know how
to get noise to come out of one.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.750
-(drum beats)
-(shouts)

04:50.583 --> 04:54.500
(shouting slowly)
I really like this place!

04:56.583 --> 04:58.458
This one's just kind of a box.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.458
Rolly:
Doesn't look like
it makes any noise at all.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.166
What's this thing do?

05:02.166 --> 05:04.458
-(amp blares note loudly)
-(both shout)

05:06.458 --> 05:08.125
Rock 'n' roll!

05:09.208 --> 05:11.458
I guess now we know
what that thing does.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.500
It makes music
and noise,

05:13.500 --> 05:15.000
which is exactly what
Bob wants.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.333
Hey, let us in!

05:17.333 --> 05:18.958
Sir, excuse me!

05:18.958 --> 05:20.875
Uh, do you repair kazoos?

05:20.875 --> 05:22.875
Sure, but come back tomorrow.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.583
I'm closing early
to see the parade.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.625
This is terrible.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.458
I know, a broken kazoo?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.958
How is she gonna get by?

05:29.958 --> 05:31.625
And without any
noisy instruments,

05:31.625 --> 05:33.958
we'll have to think of
some other noisy musicy things

05:33.958 --> 05:35.583
for Bob's parade.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.458
♪ ♪

05:37.458 --> 05:39.416
Okay, what's something

05:39.416 --> 05:41.583
we can bring Bob
that marches and makes noise?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.500
Because that's what
he likes about a parade.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.583
(quacking)

05:48.458 --> 05:49.583
You think of anything yet?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.000
Nope. You?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.125
I don't think so.

05:53.125 --> 05:56.125
(quacking)

05:56.125 --> 05:59.000
It's kind of hard to concentrate
with all that noise around here.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.458
Yeah, all that
"quack, quack, quacking"

06:01.458 --> 06:03.708
makes it hard to do
any think, think, thinking.

06:03.708 --> 06:05.458
(quacking continues)

06:05.458 --> 06:06.958
Could you ducks please stop

06:06.958 --> 06:09.125
marching past here and
making so much noise?

06:09.125 --> 06:12.416
Yeah, we're trying to think
of something that marches
and makes a lot of noise.

06:12.416 --> 06:13.708
Wait a minute.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.208
These ducks could be
our parade for Bob!

06:16.208 --> 06:18.500
These ducks could be
your what for who?

06:18.500 --> 06:21.583
You can go past Bob's house
marching in a line

06:21.583 --> 06:23.583
so he can see a parade today
like he wanted.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.875
Sorry, we're ducks
on a mission.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.416
Hey, we love missions!

06:27.416 --> 06:30.083
We need to find ourselves
a new park to live in.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.958
That's why we're looking
here, there, and everywhere.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.250
We know a park
that'd be perfect for you.

06:35.250 --> 06:38.333
And best of all, you have to go
right in front of Bob's house
to get there.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.125
Which means
he could see you march.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.833
Uh, maybe.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.208
Let me quack it over
with the family.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.458
(ducks quacking)

06:50.250 --> 06:51.375
Quack,
quack, quack.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.166
You got yourselves a deal.

06:53.166 --> 06:54.583
You show us the park,

06:54.583 --> 06:56.833
and we'll be your parade.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.958
-(marching band
music playing)
-Forward, quack!

06:58.958 --> 07:00.250
Bob's gonna be so happy

07:00.250 --> 07:01.583
when he looks out his window

07:01.583 --> 07:02.708
and sees we brought

07:07.000 --> 07:08.583
You and I know how
to make music.

Then, if no cars
are coming, it's safe to go.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.750

Uh-oh,
that duck is still
in the crosswalk.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.583
I need to make sure the cars
go in a different direction

08:07.583 --> 08:09.708

all the way past our friend,

08:27.375 --> 08:29.000
Cagey, at the pet store

08:29.000 --> 08:30.750
and then past Bob's house
right after that.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.333
This parade
is gonna be awesome!

08:33.333 --> 08:36.708
All march-y and noise-y
and music-y and... yeah!

08:36.708 --> 08:38.125
(air whooshing)

08:38.125 --> 08:40.875
Bingo, did this sidewalk
suddenly get all floaty feeling,

08:40.875 --> 08:42.250
like we're on
a great big balloon?

08:42.250 --> 08:45.125
Because the two of us
are floating on
a great big balloon!

08:45.125 --> 08:48.125
Uh, do you want
us to wait for you?

08:48.125 --> 08:50.708
No, you should probably
go on ahead without us.

08:50.708 --> 08:54.458
When you get to the pet store,
ask Cagey the guinea pig,
"Which way to the park?"

08:54.458 --> 08:57.750
Then you'll march
right past Bob's house
like a parade!

08:57.750 --> 09:02.500
Pet store, Cagey,
Bob's house, park. Got it.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.583
(quacking)

09:05.583 --> 09:08.000
-What kind of balloon
is this, anyway?
-I'm not sure,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.875
but that collar
is exactly the same
as your collar.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.458
And that ear
looks like your ear.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.000
And the whole thing
has the same colors
as you and me!

09:16.000 --> 09:19.708
Rolly, this is a Bingo
and Rolly balloon!

09:19.708 --> 09:21.833
Rolly:
Bow to the wow, wow, wow!

09:21.833 --> 09:23.083
Bingo:
This must be the balloon

09:23.083 --> 09:24.875
that Bob designed
for the parade.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.500
Rolly:
Which means we're in the parade!

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
-(firetruck horn blares)
-Can we see the ducks
from up here?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.833
We can see everything
from up here!

09:30.833 --> 09:32.416
That park you're looking for

09:32.416 --> 09:33.833
is straight down there

09:33.833 --> 09:35.500
and around the corner.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.291
Just keep marching,
you can't miss it.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.958
Quack you very much.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.166
Bingo:
There they go the one way.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.833
Rolly:
While this parade's
gonna go the other.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.458
(quacking)

09:53.166 --> 09:54.708
It's those ducks again.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.333
I better make sure this parade
goes in a different direction

09:57.333 --> 09:59.208
so they can be safe.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.500
This looks like a nice place
to watch the parade.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.875
Sure is. We'll get to see
the whole thing from here,

10:04.875 --> 10:06.750
starting with
the shiny, red firetruck.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.208
They're making the parade
go a different way, Frank.

10:12.208 --> 10:15.375
Now we'll have to move
to another place to watch it.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.875
But at least we get to see
those cute little duckies.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.458
Quack, quack, quack,
little duckies! Quack, quack!

10:21.875 --> 10:23.708
Rolly:
Those ducks made it
across the street.

10:23.708 --> 10:26.875
-Yay!
-Which means they'll be
going right past Bob's house.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.458
High-paw! Whoa!

10:29.458 --> 10:31.000
Whoa, what happened?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Bingo:
We're going around that corner,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.416
into the direction
of the parade.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.500
Yeah, now we're going
the same way as the ducks.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.875
(horn honks)

10:40.708 --> 10:41.750
(firetruck horn honks)

10:41.750 --> 10:43.000
Great gears!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.416
What is that?

10:44.416 --> 10:47.000
Bingo, the parade's going
in front of Bob's house!

10:47.000 --> 10:50.083
So we need to get off this thing
and go tell Bob. Come on!

10:50.083 --> 10:52.833
You can see the parade
right in front of our house.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.333
On your bark...

10:56.333 --> 10:58.000
-Get set...
-Go!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.416
Bingo:
Balloon slide!

11:00.500 --> 11:02.750
Bingo! Rolly! Hissy!

11:02.750 --> 11:04.291
-Bob!
-Hey, Bob!

11:05.875 --> 11:07.875
Hoo-hoo! Oh, you're not
gonna believe what's outside!

11:07.875 --> 11:09.625
It's the parade, we know!

11:09.625 --> 11:12.125
We brought it here
so you could see it.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.000
-(barking)
-Put your tails
in turbo and let's go!

11:17.416 --> 11:18.833
(horn honks)

11:18.833 --> 11:20.500
This better be good.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.416
I interrupted
my nap for this.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.250
Oh, I can't believe the parade

11:24.250 --> 11:26.291
came right down my street.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.875
Now I get to see it!

11:27.875 --> 11:31.458
-(invention whirring)
-And I finished this invention
just in time for us to use it.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.875
Oh, we've got the best
seat in town

11:39.875 --> 11:41.958
with a perfect view
of the parade!

11:46.166 --> 11:47.875
Bob:
Oh, beauty!

11:47.875 --> 11:49.375
(quacking)

11:49.375 --> 11:51.875
This is the best spot ever!

11:51.875 --> 11:53.875
Yeah!
We can see everything.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.083
Are we blocking your view?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.958
Not at all, because...

12:01.000 --> 12:02.875
-Oh!
-Wow.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.958
Now the view
is even better!

12:04.958 --> 12:07.875
And look, there are
the balloons I designed!

12:07.875 --> 12:11.583
-(horn honking)
-(chuckles) Oh, now
this is what I call a parade!

12:11.583 --> 12:13.125
Woo-hoo!

12:16.958 --> 12:18.833
(Bingo speaks)

12:18.833 --> 12:22.166
(snarls) I'm gonna get you,
you blowy blue balloon!

12:22.166 --> 12:24.000
(growls) (groans)

12:25.000 --> 12:26.833
Nice try, Rolly,

12:26.833 --> 12:29.708
but this is a job
for Bingo the bouncer!

12:29.708 --> 12:32.583
(grunts)

12:32.583 --> 12:34.458
Uh, can I have that guys?

12:34.458 --> 12:37.166
I need to hang it up
with the other decorations.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.625
It's my mom's
birthday party tonight,

12:39.625 --> 12:42.291
so we're all gonna
treat her like a queen, okay?

12:42.291 --> 12:46.125
I even got her
this paper crown to wear.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.875
Well, I've got
to get to work.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.250
But I'll see you
when it's party time.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.958
I wish it was party time
all the time!

12:53.958 --> 12:56.291
Me too, but Bob wants us
to treat his mom

12:56.291 --> 12:58.500
like a queen and we don't know
how to do that.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.958
Yeah, and where are we

12:59.958 --> 13:01.833
gonna find a queen
so we can learn how?

13:01.833 --> 13:04.625
They have a queen in England.
Maybe you should go there.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.000
Hissy, are you saying
we should go all the way
to England,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.875
find the queen,
learn how they treat her,

13:09.875 --> 13:12.708
and then come back here
and treat Bob's mom
the same way?

13:12.708 --> 13:15.000
Well, when you say it
like that, it seems
kind of crazy.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It seems kind of perfect!

13:17.000 --> 13:19.166
(gasps)
A perfect mission?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.875
It is so a mission!

13:20.875 --> 13:22.083
Let's go!

13:26.958 --> 13:30.250
-Rolly: The Queen of England
lives there?
-Bingo: Yep.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.500
It's called a palace.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.083
We need to figure out
how to get inside.

13:34.083 --> 13:38.291
Now, those men
in the furry hats are
the "Queen's Guards," Frank,

13:38.291 --> 13:43.083
and it's their job to keep
anyone from getting through
the palace gates.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.708
Hm, seems like a good gig.

13:44.708 --> 13:45.958
Why do they look so grumpy?

13:45.958 --> 13:49.166
(gasps) Oh, oh!
They never laugh or smile.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.000
That's part of the job.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.875
Well, then I wouldn't be
very good at it 'cause
I'm always getting the giggles.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.291
(giggles) See?

13:56.291 --> 13:59.000
(laughs)

13:59.000 --> 14:02.083
Maybe if we can get those guards
to smile or laugh,

14:02.083 --> 14:04.833
they'd be so happy
they'd let us into the palace.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.083
But that lady said
they never smile or laugh.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.250
Then we'll give them
something to laugh about.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.208
-Funny faces?
-Funny faces.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.291
Get ready for this, boys.

14:14.291 --> 14:18.625
(blubbering)

14:20.625 --> 14:22.458
Wow, tough palace.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.000
What are we
gonna do?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.250
If we can't get
past those guards,

14:25.250 --> 14:27.083
we'll never
get inside that palace.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.000
Unless we go through
that doggy door right there.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.125
That doggy what right where?

14:31.125 --> 14:32.000
Huh.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.500
Look at this place!

14:34.500 --> 14:36.125
It's pronounced "palace," Bingo.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.875
-Is that the Queen?
-Looks like it.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.875
Bingo:
And that must be
the Queen's dog.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.208
I most certainly am.

14:43.208 --> 14:48.000
I am Crumpetsworth Cream Puff
Scone Triflebottom III,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.458
at your service.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.708
But you may call me Crumpet.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.250
You may call us Bingo and Rolly,

14:53.250 --> 14:54.083
'cause those are our names.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.875
Well then, Bingo and Rolly,

14:56.875 --> 14:58.708
may I ask what two puppies

14:58.708 --> 15:00.166
are doing here

15:00.166 --> 15:01.458
in the Queen's palace?

15:01.458 --> 15:03.375
We need to learn how
to treat a queen

15:03.375 --> 15:05.000
so we know what to do
for Bob's mom

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
at her birthday party.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.083
You gotta teach us.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.583
Pretty please?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.166
Well, since you said
"pretty please,"

15:11.166 --> 15:12.458
I don't see how a chap

15:12.458 --> 15:14.166
like me can say no.
(laughs)

15:14.166 --> 15:16.250
Jolly good then.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.583
Let's get to work.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.458
Now, the first thing
you need to learn

15:22.458 --> 15:24.125
about how to treat a queen

15:24.125 --> 15:27.250
is when and when not
to eat biscuits.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.291
-(sniffs)
-At tea time,

15:28.291 --> 15:30.000
one must never
eat their biscuits

15:30.000 --> 15:32.166
until after they've been
given permission.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.708
(chewing noisily) Oh, after?

15:34.708 --> 15:36.125
Sorry.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.708
Let's give it another go,
shall we?

15:39.708 --> 15:40.875
As I was saying,

15:40.875 --> 15:43.875
-do not eat the biscuits until--
-(chewing noisily)

15:45.166 --> 15:47.083
I say, this is a challenge.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.708
He's not real good at waiting.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.000
-Nope.
-(laughs)

15:50.000 --> 15:52.208
Can I have a biscuit, please?

15:52.208 --> 15:54.875
Another way
to treat the queen well

15:54.875 --> 15:58.583
is to sit still for
the yearly portrait painting.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.208
Sitting still?
That sounds easy.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.208
There is no greater compliment

16:04.208 --> 16:07.875
-to the queen than to
sit still in her presence.
-(laughs)

16:07.875 --> 16:10.625
I remember
on one such occasion--

16:10.625 --> 16:12.583
-(Rolly growls)
-(Bingo laughs)

16:12.583 --> 16:14.583
I'm gonna get you!

16:14.583 --> 16:17.166
(clears throat)

16:17.166 --> 16:18.583
Sorry.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.125
As I was saying,

16:20.125 --> 16:22.583
I recall a few years ago...

16:22.583 --> 16:24.250
-(grunting, growling)
-I say, pups,

16:24.250 --> 16:27.000
you're-- you're supposed
to be sitting still.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.125
We were sitting still...

16:29.125 --> 16:30.375
for a second,

16:30.375 --> 16:32.375
but it got really hard
after that.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.000
Oh, my.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.125
Now, here's a way

16:36.125 --> 16:37.833
to treat a queen
that you boys

16:37.833 --> 16:39.458
should be
able to do:

16:39.458 --> 16:42.166
process in a straight line.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.000
Uh, that means walk.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.458
Like this...

16:50.416 --> 16:52.333
We're awesome at walking.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.333
But be careful,
these royal floors can be

16:55.333 --> 16:58.000
-royally... slippery.
-Pugs: Whoa!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.708
Whoa! Whoa, oh, oh, oh! Oh!

16:59.708 --> 17:01.125
-Whoa! No!
-Whoa!

17:01.125 --> 17:02.875
I say, stop that slipping!

17:02.875 --> 17:04.708
And we say, we can't!

17:06.416 --> 17:09.708
(groans) Everything's
all right then. (chuckles)

17:09.708 --> 17:12.125
-No damage done.
-Whoa! (grunts)

17:22.708 --> 17:23.708
Both:
Ah!

17:26.458 --> 17:30.125
Well, this is
a royal mess.

17:30.125 --> 17:34.250
Uh... I'm afraid I don't
have time for anymore
lessons today.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.000
We're so sorry, Crumpet.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.958
Bob's mom's party is tonight.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.375
Can you still help us?

17:39.375 --> 17:40.708
We didn't mean
to make a mess.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.333
I'm so sorry, pups,

17:42.333 --> 17:44.750
but tea time with the queen
is starting soon

17:44.750 --> 17:47.500
and I need to straighten
the hallway before it begins.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.125
Thanks anyway, old chap.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.708
Yeah, old chap.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.583
(sighs) You gave it
a jolly good try.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.875
We made a really big mess.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.458
I wish we could
make it up to Crumpet somehow.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.333
Whoa! What's going on?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.250
Looks like Bob's
not the only one

18:04.250 --> 18:06.250
throwing a party.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.208
Wait a second.

18:07.208 --> 18:10.458
A fancy table
with biscuits set for tea.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.708
Rolly, do you realize
what this is?

18:12.708 --> 18:15.708
Uh, a fancy table
with biscuits set for tea?

18:15.708 --> 18:17.625
This is the queen's tea!

18:17.625 --> 18:19.125
♪ ♪

18:19.125 --> 18:22.458
What's that...
(mimics trumpet) mean?

18:22.458 --> 18:25.583
I don't know. Maybe we should
hide until we figure it out.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.166
Bingo:
Bow to the wow,

18:31.166 --> 18:32.416
it's the Queen!

18:33.875 --> 18:37.000
(trumpets playing)

18:40.291 --> 18:42.333
Queen:
Good afternoon, everyone.

18:42.333 --> 18:43.500
Please be seated.

18:49.458 --> 18:52.125
Greatest chew toy ever!

18:54.333 --> 18:56.333
(chewing)

18:56.333 --> 18:58.291
Queen:
I'm so glad that
you could join me.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.416
Please, help yourselves.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.458
-(chewing)
-Put that back!

19:03.458 --> 19:05.125
But it tastes so good!

19:05.125 --> 19:06.500
Nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom, nom!

19:06.500 --> 19:09.166
I say, has anyone
spied my purse?

19:09.166 --> 19:12.166
Rolly, that's the Queen's purse!

19:12.166 --> 19:14.250
Oh, is that
what this thing is?

19:16.375 --> 19:19.208
Not to worry, here it is.

19:19.208 --> 19:22.416
But where's my doggy, Crumpet?

19:22.416 --> 19:26.833
Crumpetsworth Cream Puff
Scone Triflebottom III?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.458
Oh no.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.750
Crumpet is late,
and it's all our fault.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.416
Crumpet? Crumpet?

19:33.416 --> 19:35.000
(clears throat)

19:35.000 --> 19:36.333
(British accent)
Hello, Crumpet here.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.333
(barking)

19:38.333 --> 19:40.291
Good, that sounded
just like him.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.458
(British accent)
Very good, then.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.000
Queen: I can't wait
to introduce you
to my guests.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.083
My darling Crumpet,

19:46.083 --> 19:48.333
why are you hiding
under the table?

19:48.333 --> 19:52.250
Queen:
Enjoy yourself
a biscuit, darling.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.458
Just take one,

19:53.458 --> 19:55.458
-the way you've been
trained to do.
-(gasps)

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
-(both grunt)
-Rolly!

19:58.291 --> 19:59.875
You can do it, Rolly.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.875
(Rolly panting)

20:04.875 --> 20:07.000
Queen:
Good boy.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.375
Now come out from under
that table so I can give you
a scratchy behind your ears.

20:11.375 --> 20:12.583
Uh-oh.

20:12.583 --> 20:15.000
If we go out there,
she'll know we're not Crumpet.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.583
(normal voice)
Although I do like
a good scratchy behind the ears.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.583
Queen:
Crumpet,
where are you?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.166
What are we gonna do?

20:21.166 --> 20:23.166
Queen:
Crumpet, come out at once.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.000
Bingo:
She'll know
we're not Crumpet.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.166
(Crumpet clears throat)

20:26.166 --> 20:28.333
I'm coming, ma'am.

20:29.958 --> 20:32.875
-(bark)
-Oh, there's my Crumpet.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.208
Good doggie.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.500
Thanks for filling in
until I arrived.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.458
Turns out you chaps
do know how to treat a queen.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.375
-High-paw!
-(British accent)
Very good, old chap.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.875
(normal voice)
We just wanted to say
thank you for all your help.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.583
You're welcome, pups.

20:47.583 --> 20:50.708
We need to get home
so we can treat Bob's mom
like a queen!

20:50.708 --> 20:52.458
Then let's Rolly on out of here.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.583
-Goodbye, Crumpet!
-Cheers, lads!

20:54.583 --> 20:56.375
Hissy:
Hold on,

20:56.375 --> 20:59.833
you really had tea
with the Queen?

20:59.833 --> 21:02.583
-Indeed we did.
-We learned how
to process.

21:02.583 --> 21:03.958
That means walk.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.000
And they also blow
trumpets and bow.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.875
(British accent)
It was a jolly good trip, I say.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.125
-Jolly good!
-(doorbell rings)

21:10.125 --> 21:12.000
Oh, she's here!

21:12.000 --> 21:14.833
Come on, Rolly, we have to
treat Bob's mom like a queen!

21:18.875 --> 21:20.333
Are you ready for this?

21:20.333 --> 21:21.833
(normal voice)
Let's show her
everything we learned.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.958
Happy birthday to me!

21:23.958 --> 21:25.583
Bob:
Happy birthday, Mom!

21:25.583 --> 21:26.583
Let's do the trumpet!

21:26.583 --> 21:29.458
(both imitating trumpets)

21:29.458 --> 21:33.583
Oh, ho-ho! Are those
your two little puppies I hear?

21:33.583 --> 21:36.750
Oh! Aren't they
as cute as cute can be?

21:36.750 --> 21:40.083
Here you go,
have some doggie biscuits.

21:45.458 --> 21:46.958
Well, why aren't
they eating them?

21:46.958 --> 21:48.500
What's wrong, fellas?

21:50.291 --> 21:51.708
Well, they've never
done that before.

21:51.708 --> 21:54.583
They usually don't wait
so politely for their treats.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.875
Go ahead boys,
eat those treats.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.208
Yay!

21:58.208 --> 21:59.458
(laughs)

21:59.458 --> 22:01.583
This way, Mom.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.083
Got the birthday party all set.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.458
Wait, Rolly, don't forget
the Queen's purse.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.833
Oh, right.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.166
Got it.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.583
Processing
for the birthday Queen.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.166
(barking)

22:14.166 --> 22:15.708
Why, thank you, Rolly.

22:15.708 --> 22:18.250
I always like to
have this right by my side.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.166
And we even learned
a special birthday song,

22:21.166 --> 22:23.583
just for you, Mom.
Ready, pups?

22:23.583 --> 22:25.500
♪ Me, me, me-me-me ♪

22:25.500 --> 22:28.083
-♪ Today is your birthday ♪
-(puppies yipping along)

22:28.083 --> 22:30.458
♪ So let's sing a song ♪

22:30.458 --> 22:32.083
♪ And have a big party ♪

22:32.083 --> 22:33.708
Bob/Bingo/Rolly:

22:33.708 --> 22:35.083
♪ Your special day ♪

22:35.083 --> 22:38.875

22:38.875 --> 22:42.125
♪ Happy birthday,

22:42.125 --> 22:43.875
-Happy birthday!
-(puppies barking)

22:43.875 --> 22:45.583
I almost forgot
your birthday crown.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.500
I have to say,

22:48.500 --> 22:51.583
I have never
been treated so well.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.458
I feel like a queen.

22:53.458 --> 22:55.458
Good work, chap. Jolly good.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.875
You too, chap.
Good and jolly.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.333
Time for the birthday portrait.

22:59.333 --> 23:00.625
Remember to sit still.

23:00.625 --> 23:01.708
Here we go.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.625
Smile, everybody.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.833
Oh, look at that.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.458
The perfect picture.

23:09.458 --> 23:11.583
You guys sat perfectly still.

23:11.583 --> 23:14.166
They must know
it's my special day.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.500
Rolly:
Wow, we look great!

23:15.500 --> 23:18.416
Yeah. I bet Crumpet
would be really proud of us

23:18.416 --> 23:20.291
for sitting still
for the birthday portrait.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.708
Indeed.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.625
This calls for more trumpets.

23:23.625 --> 23:24.500
Yeah!

23:24.500 --> 23:26.625
-(both imitating trumpets)
-(laughs)

23:26.625 --> 23:30.000
(all laugh)

23:32.166 --> 23:33.875
(end theme playing)

23:35.625 --> 23:37.333
(barking)

23:41.000 --> 23:42.458
(barking)

23:43.583 --> 23:45.250
(record
scratching)

23:52.291 --> 23:53.333
(both bark)

23:56.750 --> 23:58.375
(barking)
