WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:04.254
Boys...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.254
you see what I have?

00:04.296 --> 00:07.508
This is a movie I asked you

00:04.296 --> 00:07.508
to return three weeks ago.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.050
What if we want

00:07.549 --> 00:09.050
to watch it again?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
I found it in the dishwasher.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.764
21 days times $2.99 a day,

00:11.094 --> 00:13.764
that's...

00:13.806 --> 00:15.933
$62.79.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.933
What?!

00:15.975 --> 00:17.434
What is it going to take

00:15.975 --> 00:17.434
for you boys

00:17.476 --> 00:19.060
to learn some responsibility?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.897
You can't just go through life

00:19.102 --> 00:21.897
letting things slide?

00:21.939 --> 00:25.150
Sooner or later, you are going

00:21.939 --> 00:25.150
to learn that...

00:25.192 --> 00:27.068

01:06.859 --> 01:08.610
Mom's been at her sister's

01:06.859 --> 01:08.610
for a month,

01:08.652 --> 01:10.029
resting while she's pregnant.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.822
Things were kind of chaotic

01:10.070 --> 01:11.822
for a while,

01:11.864 --> 01:13.949
but we've settled

01:11.864 --> 01:13.949
into a pretty nice rhythm.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.999
Can I use a glass?

01:22.041 --> 01:24.125
No.  Nothing

01:22.041 --> 01:24.125
that requires washing.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.085
Okay,

01:24.167 --> 01:26.085
let's clear the table.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.385
Oh, I talked to your mother

01:31.884 --> 01:33.385
last night.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.137
She misses you all very much,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.137
and she'll be home soon.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
How soon?

01:38.181 --> 01:40.601
A few weeks.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.601
(sighing)

01:40.642 --> 01:42.019
Oh, and Reese,

01:40.642 --> 01:42.019
she wanted you

01:42.061 --> 01:43.228
to sweep the leaves

01:42.061 --> 01:43.228
off the garage roof

01:43.270 --> 01:44.521
when you get home

01:43.270 --> 01:44.521
from school today.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
What? But today

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
is the one day

01:46.481 --> 01:48.233
that Alison's parents

01:46.481 --> 01:48.233
aren't home.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.444
To interfere

01:48.275 --> 01:50.444
with our homework.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.320
Reese, your mother...

01:50.485 --> 01:52.320
This isn't fair!

01:52.362 --> 01:54.155
Mom can't control us

01:52.362 --> 01:54.155
when she's not even here!

01:54.197 --> 01:57.200
Nobody is being controlled

01:54.197 --> 01:57.200
by your mother.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.411
For instance, I'm inviting

01:57.242 --> 01:59.411
an old friend over tonight,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.204
and even though

01:59.453 --> 02:01.204
we're never going to tell

02:01.246 --> 02:04.165
your mother about it, it doesn't

02:01.246 --> 02:04.165
mean we're being controlled.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.627
To repeat: Your mother is never

02:04.207 --> 02:06.627
to hear about this.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.963
And you boys are just going

02:06.668 --> 02:08.963
to love Larry.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.881
We were inseparable

02:09.004 --> 02:10.881
in high school.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.174
But seriously, your mother

02:10.923 --> 02:13.174
cannot find out

02:13.216 --> 02:14.342
he was in this house.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.178
Dad, you're hurting me.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.178
Oh.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.680
Sorry, sweetheart.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.557
WOMAN:

02:18.722 --> 02:20.557
Malcolm... Stevie!

02:20.599 --> 02:22.183
Hi, Mrs. Hooper.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.351
Do either of you

02:22.225 --> 02:23.351
hooligans

02:23.393 --> 02:24.979
know where my son,

02:23.393 --> 02:24.979
Dabney, is?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.480
I don't know.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.480
He was excused from gym.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.482
What  is  a nervous eyelid

02:26.521 --> 02:28.482
anyway?

02:28.523 --> 02:31.902
It's an allergic reaction

02:28.523 --> 02:31.902
to either gluten, whey or air.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.361
I suppose

02:31.944 --> 02:33.361
you boys are coming

02:33.403 --> 02:35.280
to Dabney's birthday

02:33.403 --> 02:35.280
party tonight.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.280
Yeah.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.282
Sure.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.282
Just a little reminder:

02:37.324 --> 02:39.200
I don't want either of you

02:39.242 --> 02:42.370
showing up with any punk hairdos

02:39.242 --> 02:42.370
or racy outfits.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.999
BOY: What are you doing

02:42.412 --> 02:44.999
on the pavement, huh?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.792
I told you to walk

02:45.040 --> 02:46.792
on the grass.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.876
There's another guy

02:47.918 --> 02:49.878
who doesn't let me walk

02:47.918 --> 02:49.878
on the grass.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.047
Fine, you like the pavement

02:49.920 --> 02:52.047
so much, kiss it.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.216
Oh, my God... Dabney!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.301
You come away from there!

02:56.343 --> 02:57.385
Did you make

02:57.427 --> 02:58.804
eye contact

02:57.427 --> 02:58.804
with that big boy?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.014
When you're

02:58.846 --> 03:00.014
in danger,

03:00.055 --> 03:01.640
you tuck and cower.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.433
I was cowering;

03:01.682 --> 03:03.433
he wouldn't let me tuck.

MAN: Hello.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.170
This is a recorded greeting

03:31.210 --> 03:32.171
from the Malgacore Financial...

03:32.211 --> 03:34.255
Hi, Mom. We're fine.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.465
(drops slingshot)

03:35.507 --> 03:37.092
Okay, I'll ask him.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.260
Mom wants to know

03:37.134 --> 03:39.260
if you swept the leaves

03:39.302 --> 03:41.262
off the garage.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.262
I'm doing it now.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.765
(recorded message continues)

03:45.976 --> 03:48.269
So Piama called-- she and

03:45.976 --> 03:48.269
Gretchen got to Tucson okay.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.689
Tucson...

03:48.311 --> 03:50.689
the city that never sleeps.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.650
They think they're going

03:50.731 --> 03:53.650
to have so much fun

03:53.692 --> 03:55.485
but we will show them, eh?

03:55.527 --> 03:56.444
Just us guys.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.863
Where do you want

03:56.486 --> 03:57.863
your things, Otto?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.280
Just put them in Francis' room.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.490
What?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.951
Oh, and Gretchen left this

04:00.532 --> 04:02.951
for you.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.951
Wh...?

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
Hold on. Why is he bringing

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
your things to my room?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.539
Because I'm staying with you

04:05.328 --> 04:07.539
this weekend.

04:07.581 --> 04:12.293
I have not slept alone

04:07.581 --> 04:12.293
in a bed for 35 years.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.089
You're planning on sleeping

04:12.335 --> 04:15.089
in my bed? With me?

04:15.130 --> 04:18.258
It would be presumptuous of me

04:15.130 --> 04:18.258
to ask a guest.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.719
"Don't forget to sweep

04:19.342 --> 04:20.719
the leaves

04:20.761 --> 04:22.554
"off my roof

04:20.761 --> 04:22.554
'cause I'm a mean old lady.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.223
"Who cares if it's wet

04:22.596 --> 04:24.223
and slippery?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.348
"The roof

04:24.264 --> 04:25.348
has to be cleaned

04:25.390 --> 04:26.767
'cause I'm stupid."

04:26.808 --> 04:28.143
(phone ringing)

04:26.808 --> 04:28.143
Not it.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.310
Hello?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.105
Oh, hi, Mom.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.397
I wasn't talking about her.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.398
What do you mean "Mom"?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.025
It's me, Francis.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.025
Did you page me?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.484
Yeah, Reese is right here.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.028
I'll tell him, Mom,

04:38.070 --> 04:40.321
but does he really have

04:38.070 --> 04:40.321
to stay up all night?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.322
Can't he fix

04:41.364 --> 04:42.532
my bike tomorrow?

04:42.574 --> 04:43.909
Well, you're right.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.037
Saturday morning

04:43.951 --> 04:47.037
is the best time for riding.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.329
FRANCIS:

04:47.079 --> 04:48.329
Okay.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.206
Now I get it.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.331
Just go easy on him.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.126
You're a lot smarter than he is.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.334
I've got to go.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.713
OTTO:

04:54.377 --> 04:56.713
Whoo!

04:56.755 --> 04:57.839
Whoo!

04:57.881 --> 04:59.258
This floor is so cold.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.926
Get me under those

04:59.299 --> 05:00.926
warm blankets.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.844
Aah...!

05:02.886 --> 05:04.846
Aah.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.266
Aah...

05:07.307 --> 05:08.642
This is sort of weird.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.020
I haven't had a sleep-over

05:08.683 --> 05:12.020
since I was in the third grade.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.149
I was at Jeffery Feldman's house

05:12.062 --> 05:15.149
and his mom, uh...

05:15.190 --> 05:17.442
Otto, what the hell

05:15.190 --> 05:17.442
are you doing?!

05:17.484 --> 05:20.070
I know, I am a

05:17.484 --> 05:20.070
notorious blanket hog.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.404
(chuckles)

05:21.446 --> 05:23.198
Mmm.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.198
(screams)

05:23.240 --> 05:24.950
Otto!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.950
Ooh. Sorry.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.868
Popsicle toes.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.868
(laughs)

05:26.910 --> 05:28.787
(laughing playfully)

05:29.704 --> 05:32.415
(Otto laughs, sighs)

05:33.458 --> 05:34.960
(woman screaming)

05:35.002 --> 05:36.753
MAN (on TV):

05:35.002 --> 05:36.753
Push! Push!

05:36.795 --> 05:38.088
Look! I'm starting to crown!

05:38.130 --> 05:39.380
(Dorene screaming)

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
DORENE:

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
Get this horrible thing

05:39.422 --> 05:42.467
out of me!

05:42.509 --> 05:44.385
(screaming continues)

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
Can he open presents now?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.471
Yeah, can I?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.849
Oh, okay, but go slow.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.393
We don't want to

05:48.890 --> 05:52.393
end up covered in

05:48.890 --> 05:52.393
paper cuts, do we?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.313
Boy, this is such

05:52.435 --> 05:54.313
a great party.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.981
It's twice the turnout we had

05:56.023 --> 05:57.858
last year.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.484
(mouthing words)

05:59.526 --> 06:01.903
DABNEY:

05:59.526 --> 06:01.903
Can I open

05:59.526 --> 06:01.903
Grandpa's present

06:01.945 --> 06:03.113
first, Mom?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.240
Well, we might as well

06:03.155 --> 06:05.240
get that out of the way.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.410
STEVIE:

06:06.825 --> 06:09.410
Whoa.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.580
The XJ... 7000!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.581
Cool!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.125
What is it?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.293
It's a paintball gun.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.627
It's, like, the best

06:16.335 --> 06:17.627
one you can buy.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.213
I'll take that.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.589
But, Mom!

06:19.254 --> 06:21.589
When will your thoughtless

06:19.254 --> 06:21.589
grandfather learn?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.008
These gifts do nothing

06:23.050 --> 06:24.425
but overstimulate you.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.261
And when the

06:24.467 --> 06:26.261
so-called fun ends,

06:26.303 --> 06:28.889
you're left all red and giggly

06:26.303 --> 06:28.889
and up until 9:00.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.431
Well, not this time.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.432
Give it to Mommy.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.477
(grunting)

06:35.729 --> 06:37.314
That's okay.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.733
I wouldn't know

06:37.356 --> 06:39.733
how to paint with it anyway.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.152
Why don't you open

06:39.774 --> 06:42.152
one of my gifts?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.532
A new hairbrush.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.368
Thanks, Mom.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.451
Want to give it a try?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.745
Sure.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.955
Count down

06:51.786 --> 06:53.955
from a hundred.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.291
You boys can help.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.459
One hundred...

06:58.501 --> 07:00.045
99...

07:00.087 --> 07:02.256
BOTH:

07:00.087 --> 07:02.256
98...

07:02.297 --> 07:04.299
97...

07:06.134 --> 07:07.468
Oh, ha, ha!

07:07.510 --> 07:09.137
Here he is!

07:09.179 --> 07:12.182
Hey, you big jackass!

07:14.226 --> 07:17.145
It was just Mrs. Haggerty

07:14.226 --> 07:17.145
turning around in our driveway.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.480
So how come Mom won't let you

07:17.187 --> 07:19.480
hang out with this Larry guy?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.191
Oh, she thinks

07:19.522 --> 07:21.191
he's a bad influence.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.483
You know Mom, she's always

07:22.525 --> 07:24.194
blowing things

07:22.525 --> 07:24.194
out of proportion.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.486
Just like at our wedding.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.780
Okay, he missed

07:25.528 --> 07:26.780
the ceremony,

07:26.821 --> 07:29.490
but he did show up

07:26.821 --> 07:29.490
with these two totally hot...

07:29.532 --> 07:31.492
Well, that's a bad example.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.371
Oh, there was this time

07:31.534 --> 07:34.371
in New Orleans when we...

07:34.413 --> 07:35.872
No, that's no good either.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.498
Oh! Here's on.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.501
Our families went

07:37.540 --> 07:40.501
to the same church...

07:40.543 --> 07:42.296
Oh... well, you

07:40.543 --> 07:42.296
know your mother.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.089
She just makes

07:42.337 --> 07:44.089
stuff up.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.089
(doorbell ringing)

07:44.131 --> 07:45.506
He's here!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.384
Dewey!

07:47.426 --> 07:49.719
(rock music playing)

07:49.761 --> 07:50.804
Hoo!

07:50.845 --> 07:51.763
Oh, ho!

07:51.805 --> 07:54.224
Pass complete!

07:51.805 --> 07:54.224
Larry!

07:54.266 --> 07:55.225
Hal!

07:55.267 --> 07:56.517
Man, you look like crap.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.019
You, too, buddy.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.019
Come on in.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.105
Boys, I'd like you

07:58.061 --> 08:00.105
to meet Larry Ross.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
These are my boys.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
This is Reese

08:01.564 --> 08:02.523
and Dewey.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.523
Malcolm is at

08:02.565 --> 08:03.524
a birthday party.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.110
So, you got custody, huh?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.236
Good for you.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.904
Little word to the wise,

08:06.278 --> 08:07.904
I heard, uh,

08:07.946 --> 08:10.407
you should talk nice

08:07.946 --> 08:10.407
about the ex, even if she is...

08:10.449 --> 08:12.575
No, no, no, no, no, I'm

08:10.449 --> 08:12.575
still married to Lois.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.701
Oh, really?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.120
Oh, yeah.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.413
Well,

08:15.162 --> 08:16.413
that's-that's great, man.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.538
That's-that's just great.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.624
You know, there's a little bar

08:17.580 --> 08:19.624
down the way that...

08:19.666 --> 08:21.251
No, no, she's out

08:19.666 --> 08:21.251
of town for a while.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.128
Sweet!

08:21.293 --> 08:23.128
First beer, 7:04.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.839
One of you kids

08:23.170 --> 08:25.839
ought to write that down.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.257
(laughing)

08:27.299 --> 08:29.301
Isn't he great?

08:27.299 --> 08:29.301
(laughing)

08:31.970 --> 08:34.264
FRANCIS (to self):

08:31.970 --> 08:34.264
This  is kind of a landmark

08:31.970 --> 08:34.264
night for me.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.435
My first psychological trauma

08:34.306 --> 08:38.435
not caused by my mother.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.562
But I guess I do owe Otto for

08:38.477 --> 08:41.562
everything he's done for me.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.025
I mean, he and Gretchen

08:41.604 --> 08:45.025
have just been amazing.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.277
Gretchen....

08:47.319 --> 08:49.570
I wonder what was in

08:47.319 --> 08:49.570
that note?

08:49.612 --> 08:50.738
(screaming)

08:50.780 --> 08:53.741
(screaming continues)

08:53.783 --> 08:56.036
(screaming)

08:56.077 --> 08:59.580
(screaming)

09:01.624 --> 09:05.670
(screaming continues)

09:05.712 --> 09:07.214
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

09:07.255 --> 09:09.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.841
whoa, whoa, whoa...

09:09.883 --> 09:12.219
They had to take

09:09.883 --> 09:12.219
that tractor apart

09:09.883 --> 09:12.219
piece by piece

09:12.260 --> 09:13.887
to get it out of

09:12.260 --> 09:13.887
the teacher's lounge.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.972
But you never gave me up, man.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.308
(laughing)

09:18.350 --> 09:20.601
What happened?

09:20.643 --> 09:21.602
I mean, look at me.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.604
Middle-aged, lousy job.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.773
Dumpy little house

09:23.646 --> 09:25.773
that can't hold the kids I have

09:25.815 --> 09:27.442
and another one on the way.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.069
Don't get down on yourself, man.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.653
The only reason

09:29.110 --> 09:30.653
you're a failure

09:30.695 --> 09:33.281
is because society hates

09:30.695 --> 09:33.281
free spirits like you and me.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.324
It's the price we pay

09:34.366 --> 09:35.992
for being in

09:34.366 --> 09:35.992
the vanguard.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
You remember

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
the way Dawkins

09:37.494 --> 09:38.619
screwed us over?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.247
Who?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.247
Dawkins.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.706
Our boss back

09:40.288 --> 09:41.706
at Carmello's.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.292
You remember senior year,

09:41.748 --> 09:44.292
Labor Day weekend?

09:44.334 --> 09:45.668
The kitchen flooded.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.421
We spent the whole

09:45.710 --> 09:47.421
weekend cleaning it up,

09:47.462 --> 09:49.214
and then he stiffed

09:47.462 --> 09:49.214
us out of 200 bucks.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.507
Wait! Yeah!

09:50.549 --> 09:51.841
(growls):

09:50.549 --> 09:51.841
Unbelievable.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.552
200 bucks. I mean,

09:51.883 --> 09:53.552
you take that,

09:53.593 --> 09:55.262
plus the interest

09:53.593 --> 09:55.262
over all these years,

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
we're rolling in it.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.515
Boy, if I had that money

09:56.679 --> 09:58.515
right now,

09:58.557 --> 10:00.267
I could afford to build

09:58.557 --> 10:00.267
a nursery.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.560
Thanks a lot, Dawkins.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.062
You want a nursery, Hal?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.688
We could do it.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.482
Yeah,

10:05.730 --> 10:07.482
I got a contractor's license.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.901
We could add on to your bedroom

10:07.524 --> 10:09.901
here no problem at all.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.361
What?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.361
You knock out this wall,

10:11.403 --> 10:12.695
you extend out a little bit.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.531
We could do the whole thing

10:12.737 --> 10:14.531
for cost.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.949
We'll make do.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.658
You're not being fair

10:15.990 --> 10:17.658
to the baby, Hal.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.953
I know, but...

10:17.700 --> 10:19.953
Come on. Eye of the tiger!

10:19.994 --> 10:21.662
We create our own futures.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.874
Well, you know, you-you...

10:21.704 --> 10:24.874
you do what you can.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.502
I mean, we'll be okay

10:24.916 --> 10:27.502
as long as we...

10:27.544 --> 10:28.669
(crashing)

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
Oh, my God!

10:32.715 --> 10:33.925
Now you're committed.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.176
Let's get to work.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.678
Larry, I don't believe you!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.680
I invited you over

10:37.720 --> 10:39.680
for a couple of beers,

10:39.722 --> 10:41.391
and you punch a hole in my wall?

10:41.433 --> 10:42.683
This is exactly why

10:42.725 --> 10:45.103
I haven't seen you

10:42.725 --> 10:45.103
in all these...!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.397
That little bat did all that?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.691
(laughing)

10:50.733 --> 10:51.943
This is great.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.530
Wait till Lois sees this.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.082
Dad? I don't know

11:04.164 --> 11:06.082
what he did last night,

11:06.124 --> 11:07.708
but there's no hot water,

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
and the toilet's full

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
of sawdust.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.546
Dewey, if Dad wakes up

11:09.752 --> 11:11.546
by dinner,

11:11.588 --> 11:13.548
tell him I'm at Dabney's.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.548
DEWEY: Okay.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.383
WOMAN (over phone):

11:13.590 --> 11:15.383
Good afternoon.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.383
The current time is...

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
Yeah, Mom. My bed's

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
going in the sunny spot.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.096
Reese's bed is going in the

11:17.636 --> 11:20.096
closet like you wanted.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.722
This is ridiculous.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.975
We're never going

11:21.764 --> 11:23.975
to make that movie.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.726
I'm moving as fast

11:24.017 --> 11:25.726
as I can, okay?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
He's doing a really

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
good job, Mom.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.564
You may want to give him

11:27.770 --> 11:29.564
a break.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.232
Thanks, Dewey.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.232
You're a good brother.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.359
She said no.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.734
Don't you think it's

11:33.776 --> 11:35.654
a little strange that

11:33.776 --> 11:35.654
your mom keeps calling

11:35.694 --> 11:37.947
just so you can do

11:35.694 --> 11:37.947
Dewey's homework

11:37.989 --> 11:40.200
and-and fix Dewey's

11:37.989 --> 11:40.200
bike, and move

11:40.241 --> 11:41.576
Dewey's furniture around?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.119
What are you trying to say?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.538
It's obvious, isn't it?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.247
She wants you to do

11:44.579 --> 11:46.247
stuff for Dewey.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.957
Hey, if you want to talk

11:46.289 --> 11:47.957
to her about it...

11:47.999 --> 11:49.417
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.253
Hello?

11:52.295 --> 11:53.754
Yes, good afternoon to you, too.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.340
Well, thank you,

11:55.382 --> 11:58.343
but I really don't need to know

11:55.382 --> 11:58.343
what time it is.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.678
Wait, listen to me.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.928
Listen to me!

12:00.970 --> 12:02.763
Forget it,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.763
there's no talking to her.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.764
Good-bye.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.850
Okay, good afternoon.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.770
God, she's polite

12:05.892 --> 12:09.770
and rude at the same time.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.773
Ow! Careful!

12:12.815 --> 12:14.401
Hold still, Mom.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.777
(knocking on door)

12:14.442 --> 12:16.777
This is a tough area

12:14.442 --> 12:16.777
for us.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.946
Dabney, you get that. I'm going

12:16.819 --> 12:18.946
to go hop in the shower.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.032
If that's the Thompsons,

12:18.988 --> 12:21.032
tell them to move their car,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.450
then they'll get

12:21.074 --> 12:22.450
their cat back.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.869
Hi, Malcolm.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.869
Where's your mom?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.787
In the shower.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.787
Good. Then I won't have

12:26.829 --> 12:28.081
to put the laxative in her tea.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.957
We have to meet Stevie

12:28.122 --> 12:29.957
at paintball in an hour.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.792
Malcolm, I can't

12:29.999 --> 12:31.792
go-- Mom and I

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
are going to put on our

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
pajamas and watch videos.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.838
Dabney, your grandfather

12:33.836 --> 12:35.838
got you this amazing gun,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
and you have to use it.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.218
Look, Malcolm, I know you

12:37.840 --> 12:40.218
think I'm a mama's boy...

12:40.260 --> 12:42.803
No. Mama's boys are laughing

12:40.260 --> 12:42.803
at you  with  their mothers.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.180
Come on, I saw

12:42.845 --> 12:44.180
the look in your eye

12:44.222 --> 12:45.515
when you opened it.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.808
Admit it.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.808
You're dying to do this.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.894
You just have to break free

12:47.850 --> 12:49.894
from your mom.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.812
Malcolm, you don't understand.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.815
In exactly 17 minutes, she's

12:51.854 --> 12:54.815
going to open that shower door

12:54.857 --> 12:58.236
and expect to see me there

12:54.857 --> 12:58.236
with a warm, cozy towel.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.322
All right, let's go.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.658
(snoring)

13:15.878 --> 13:17.422
(loud gasp)

13:17.464 --> 13:19.257
Oh, my God!

13:20.675 --> 13:22.927
Damn it, Larry!

13:22.969 --> 13:24.929
Okay, think, think.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.014
How can I blame this

13:24.971 --> 13:27.014
on the boys?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.141
Good morning, princess.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.851
Larry!

13:30.893 --> 13:32.853
What have we done?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.856
I've actually made

13:32.895 --> 13:35.856
my crappy house even crappier.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.318
Yeah, we got a hell of

13:35.898 --> 13:38.318
a lot of work to do.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.860
You're damn right we do!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.446
First things first--

13:39.902 --> 13:41.446
we're going to pay

13:41.488 --> 13:43.114
a little visit on our

13:41.488 --> 13:43.114
old friend Dawkins.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.242
What?

13:43.156 --> 13:46.242
Did a little

13:43.156 --> 13:46.242
research last night.

13:46.284 --> 13:50.871
Turns out he lives in a place

13:46.284 --> 13:50.871
called Carlson Estates.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.873
Estates, man!

13:50.913 --> 13:52.873
Can you believe that?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.292
He's living a

13:52.915 --> 13:54.292
life of luxury.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.294
You... you don't

13:54.334 --> 13:56.294
even have a wall.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.878
We're going to

13:56.336 --> 13:57.878
get this guy.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.381
Larry, we-we have

13:57.920 --> 14:00.381
to fix this.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.381
This?

14:00.423 --> 14:01.882
This is nothing.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.882
Two days, tops.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.802
You lay your

14:01.924 --> 14:03.802
foundation here, zam!

14:03.842 --> 14:05.679
Little electrical,

14:03.842 --> 14:05.679
zing, zing!

14:05.720 --> 14:08.389
Put in a bay window, vrunt!

14:05.720 --> 14:08.389
You're done.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.850
Now, let's go get Dawkins.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.522
Okay.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.816
Someone was out of bed

14:15.563 --> 14:17.816
bright and early this morning.

14:17.856 --> 14:18.899
(chuckles)

14:18.941 --> 14:20.568
Yeah, Gretchen left me a note.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.111
Can't seem to find it anywhere.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.530
I think it may have been

14:23.571 --> 14:24.905
about your violent

14:23.571 --> 14:24.905
night terrors.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.491
What are you talking about?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.075
I don't speak terrified German,

14:28.117 --> 14:30.495
but you must have been having

14:28.117 --> 14:30.495
some pretty horrific dreams.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.747
That's ridiculous.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.747
I never dream.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.747
What?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.290
I never dream-- I go to sleep;

14:34.332 --> 14:36.793
eight hours later, I wake up

14:34.332 --> 14:36.793
with a slight sore throat

14:36.835 --> 14:38.085
just like everybody else.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.505
You screamed for hours.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.923
I think it was  you

14:40.547 --> 14:42.923
that had the bad dream,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.967
but don't worry,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.967
I know just what to do.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.638
I will give you a nice,

14:45.009 --> 14:48.638
oily massage before bedtime,

14:48.680 --> 14:51.932
you will sleep like a baby.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.019
HAL:

14:53.601 --> 14:55.019
This is going to be sweet.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.313
LARRY:

14:55.061 --> 14:57.313
Now, once we jump

14:55.061 --> 14:57.313
the inner fence,

14:57.355 --> 15:00.066
I'll take care of the dogs,

14:57.355 --> 15:00.066
you take out the cameras.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.534
He lives in a trailer park.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.118
Yeah, an awesome

15:09.576 --> 15:11.118
trailer park.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.953
I mean, look at

15:11.160 --> 15:12.953
that double-wide.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
You don't got a

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
trailer like that.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.875
All right, commando mode.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.682
All right, you scale

15:30.889 --> 15:32.682
the side of the trailer.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.059
See if you can get in up there

15:32.724 --> 15:35.059
where the paint's peeling.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.352
Okay.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.352
All right, move.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.687
What's going

15:36.394 --> 15:37.687
on out there?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.230
Larry?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.356
Hal?

15:40.398 --> 15:42.983
Mr. Dawkins? Is that you?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
(chuckling):

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
What a pleasant surprise.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.571
Come on in.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.615
I just put some tea on.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.243
(paintball guns popping)

15:56.623 --> 15:58.082
Stevie, cover me!

15:58.124 --> 16:02.002
(vicious yelling)

15:58.124 --> 16:02.002
(rapid popping)

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
I'm so glad

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
I dragged Dabney here.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.425
This is exactly

16:04.422 --> 16:07.425
the kind of thing he needs.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.303
(guns popping)

16:10.344 --> 16:11.471
(gun pops)

16:10.344 --> 16:11.471
(gasps)

16:11.512 --> 16:13.306
Aren't I dead by now?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.182
In the game, you are.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.182
(gun pops)

16:15.224 --> 16:17.518
(whimpers)

16:15.224 --> 16:17.518
Dabney, just fire back!

16:17.560 --> 16:19.019
Don't fire back. And don't move.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.730
We're going to go get more ammo.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.568
Get... up!

16:26.360 --> 16:28.028
You have to shoot.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
You have to do this.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
Mom was right.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.742
I could be home watching

16:30.114 --> 16:32.742
Dark Victory  right now.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.035
You have to fight back!

16:32.784 --> 16:35.035
Just pull the trigger!

16:35.077 --> 16:37.079
But there could be

16:35.077 --> 16:37.079
adverse consequences.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.331
That is your mother talking!

16:38.372 --> 16:39.916
Just shoot it!

16:39.958 --> 16:42.335
If you want to be any kind

16:39.958 --> 16:42.335
of man, shoot it now.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.005
(gun pops)

16:56.516 --> 16:59.519
(gasps):

16:56.516 --> 16:59.519
Haul ass!

17:05.817 --> 17:09.821
Brush your own damn hair!

17:14.325 --> 17:17.036
(vicious yell)

17:14.325 --> 17:17.036
(rapid popping)

17:19.580 --> 17:22.082
Get your own damn towel!

17:22.124 --> 17:23.167
(yelling)

17:23.209 --> 17:26.796
100! 99!

17:26.838 --> 17:29.757
98! 97!

17:29.799 --> 17:30.717
Aaah!

17:30.758 --> 17:34.929
I call... Dabney's team.

17:34.971 --> 17:35.930
(yelling)

17:35.972 --> 17:37.598
The tea is great.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.308
I wish I had more

17:39.350 --> 17:42.269
to offer you,

17:39.350 --> 17:42.269
but the Meals on Wheels van

17:42.311 --> 17:44.939
only comes around

17:42.311 --> 17:44.939
twice a week now.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.107
No, this is fine.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.819
You've been so... nice.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.779
Can I ask you something?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.155
See, Larry and I

17:51.821 --> 17:53.155
were talking

17:53.197 --> 17:55.157
about old times

17:53.197 --> 17:55.157
at the restaurant,

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
and a certain

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
Labor Day weekend came up.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.829
Oh, you mean the time

17:57.159 --> 17:59.829
you boys flooded the kitchen.

17:59.871 --> 18:00.955
Huh?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.206
You two were doing chin-ups

18:02.248 --> 18:03.499
on the water pipe.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.168
Oh... yeah!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.128
We  busted it!

18:08.170 --> 18:09.839
Larry, I think

18:08.170 --> 18:09.839
he's right.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.131
Mr. Slocumb

18:09.881 --> 18:11.131
didn't want me

18:11.173 --> 18:13.133
to give you your paychecks,

18:13.175 --> 18:15.845
but I snuck them to your dads.

18:15.887 --> 18:19.891
I almost got fired for that,

18:15.887 --> 18:19.891
but what's right is right.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.649
Well, that was illuminating.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.944
We now know

18:28.691 --> 18:30.944
the face of all evil

18:30.985 --> 18:33.320
is a feeble old man

18:30.985 --> 18:33.320
in a trailer park

18:33.362 --> 18:35.949
who whittles bird feeders.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.534
Well, I hope we've both

18:35.990 --> 18:38.534
learned something here.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.702
Oh, yeah.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.045
What the hell

18:46.584 --> 18:49.045
is wrong with you?!

18:49.087 --> 18:51.171
Eye of the tiger, Hal.

18:51.213 --> 18:56.010
DAWKINS: Larry? Hal?

18:51.213 --> 18:56.010
Are you boys all right?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.183
Yeah, Mom, he just

19:01.223 --> 19:03.183
finished digging

19:03.225 --> 19:05.019
that underground fort

19:03.225 --> 19:05.019
you wanted.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.186
I think you're

19:05.061 --> 19:06.186
going to have

19:06.228 --> 19:08.230
a lot of fun in it.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.230
Give me that.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.232
Honey, don't say anything.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.232
Just listen.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.192
You were right.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.192
You're always right.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.445
From now on, I will do

19:12.234 --> 19:14.445
whatever you say,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.572
because I have been happier

19:14.487 --> 19:16.572
just mindlessly obeying you

19:16.614 --> 19:18.198
than doing what I think I want

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
with any

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
of my so-called friends.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.201
I love you.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.244
I miss you.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.163
Here's Dewey.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.416
Really, Mom?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.919
You want me to cut Reese's hair?

19:29.961 --> 19:32.296
But he  loves  his hair.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.255
Okay.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.257
This is so unfair.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.678
Just get it over with.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
Mohawks are kind

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
of out, Mom.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.597
What if I...

19:41.639 --> 19:43.223
(phone ringing)

19:45.267 --> 19:47.687
Do you hear a strange

19:45.267 --> 19:47.687
ringing, Mom?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.023
You are so dead!

19:50.064 --> 19:52.150
(screaming)

19:52.191 --> 19:54.068
And the last thing I remember

19:54.110 --> 19:57.113
is him shoving paint balls

19:54.110 --> 19:57.113
up my nose.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.532
Good. Then let's just say

19:57.155 --> 19:59.532
that's where he stopped.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.535
DORENE:

19:59.573 --> 20:02.535
Where's my boy?!

19:59.573 --> 20:02.535
What have you done

20:02.576 --> 20:05.830
with my poor, delicate boy?!

20:05.872 --> 20:08.541
Oh, my God!

20:13.295 --> 20:17.050
This is  your  fault, you

20:13.295 --> 20:17.050
evil little Svengali!

20:17.091 --> 20:19.677
I knew I shouldn't let

20:17.091 --> 20:19.677
Dabney have any friends!

20:21.012 --> 20:22.304
Now, Dabney, where...

20:21.012 --> 20:22.304
Get the car.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.264
We're going home.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.976
Dabney, you've never spoken

20:24.306 --> 20:26.976
to me like this before.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.310
Well, get used to it.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.813
I'm not your little

20:28.352 --> 20:30.813
boy anymore, Mom.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.316
I'm your little  man.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.736
Oh, my.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.487
Oh...

20:38.529 --> 20:40.656
Oh, Dabney. Oh!

20:40.698 --> 20:43.868
(loud yelling)

20:43.910 --> 20:46.286
(yelling continues)

20:52.501 --> 20:55.295
"Dear Francis,

20:52.501 --> 20:55.295
to stop Otto's night terrors,

20:55.337 --> 20:57.297
"just caress his  Ohrlappchen.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.299
Gretchen."

20:59.341 --> 21:01.260
(yelling continues)

20:59.341 --> 21:01.260
His  Ohrlappchen?

21:11.353 --> 21:14.356
Please, please, please,

21:11.353 --> 21:14.356
please, please.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.525
(quietly):

21:14.398 --> 21:16.525
Ah...

21:16.567 --> 21:18.986
(sighs)

21:16.567 --> 21:18.986
Thank you.
