07:47.367 --> 07:49.000
Do you have an idea?
- We have no idea.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.836
- Last time, he ran his
whole head through the wall.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.070
- Ah!

07:52.139 --> 07:54.005
- Ahh!
- Oh!

07:54.074 --> 07:55.307
- We need a medic.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.175
- We got a little bit
of a situation, though.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.045
We got to figure out something
to do with this dance studio.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.413

it changes everything.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.315
Let's go check it out.
- Yeah, let's check it out.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.050
- Myself and Pauly
have to pivot

08:05.118 --> 08:06.751
and come up with a new plan.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.687
When you walk in here,

08:08.789 --> 08:10.055

08:10.123 --> 08:11.056

Oh, my goodness.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.594

the same as the wedding

08:15.662 --> 08:16.595

- Yep.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.796
Remember?

08:17.865 --> 08:21.166

going to find the roommates.

Hi, Chris.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.528

08:49.596 --> 08:50.996
OK, there's no one in it.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.430

and Daddy to have some fun.

someone was in this,

08:56.937 --> 08:58.370

like, pranking me,

08:58.438 --> 09:00.505

- You guys hungry?

09:02.743 --> 09:03.675
- Yeah.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.077

chicken tendies.

operation help Vinny

this elimination?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.150

09:34.808 --> 09:36.274
You want me to come back

09:36.343 --> 09:37.442
- Yes.

09:37.511 --> 09:38.743
- Bye.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.545
- This could be
a recipe for disaster

09:40.614 --> 09:42.981
because once Angelina
takes down a couple of shots

09:43.050 --> 09:44.282

09:46.486 --> 09:48.420

- I'm not making it worse.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.923
- Put flowers on it. Yeah.

15:24.991 --> 15:25.924
Can I eat that part?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.625
Maybe I can eat that part.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.693
- Time-out.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.694
Time-out.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.229
I think got this.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.697
- Yo.
- Hold on.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.932
Hello?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.033
- Open the door.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.134
It's the police.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.735
- Just say,
congrats on your success.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.937
Congrats on your success.

15:39.005 --> 15:39.971
- Hi.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.406
- Hi, Vin.
Congrats.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.440
[cheering]
- What's up?

15:42.509 --> 15:43.775
- Congrats on doing so well!

15:43.843 --> 15:47.478
We're so proud of you!

15:47.547 --> 15:49.580
- My cake says congrats.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.282
Something is scratched out.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.152
Probably said, congrats on
getting to the semifinals.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.853
But it's the thought
that counts.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.255
I got the best fam.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.190
Angelina is probably
throwing this at someone later.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.658
- Did you miss our faces?
Did you miss--

16:00.727 --> 16:01.659
- Yeah, I did.
- Yeah, you did.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.694
Did you miss my vagina lips?

16:02.762 --> 16:03.761
- Oh, damn.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.730
- Oh, my God.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.165
- Honestly, after,
like, the drama

16:07.233 --> 16:08.599
that I've been through these
last couple of months--

16:08.668 --> 16:10.101
- It's like a cakewalk.
- This is, like, amazing.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.302
[laughter]

16:11.371 --> 16:14.238
- You're like, yes, Angelina!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.206
- So what's the plan
for tonight?

16:15.275 --> 16:16.708
Anybody know?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.009
- It was supposed to be
Vinny's celebratory party,

16:18.078 --> 16:20.745
but now he didn't make it, so--

16:20.814 --> 16:22.246
- So like, you think
we should show this guy?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.982
- We've got something
to show you.

16:24.951 --> 16:25.883
- Oh.

16:25.952 --> 16:26.884
The dance studio.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.320
- Exactly.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.756
This was set up for you
to practice with Coco.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.224
- It was actually
a nice gesture

16:33.293 --> 16:35.193
that, you know, my roommates
set up this dance

16:35.261 --> 16:37.228
studio in case I was
going to have to rehearse

16:37.297 --> 16:38.763
<i> my dances with Coco.</i>

16:38.832 --> 16:41.466
This would have been
very challenging to learn

16:41.534 --> 16:42.600
two dances...
- That's what I said.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.235
- In this space, right here.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.904
But I'm actually happy
as hell that

16:46.973 --> 16:48.239
I don't have to use
this dance studio.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.008
- You have to show us
how to do some moves,

16:50.076 --> 16:52.143
like actual, like,
cha, cha, cha.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.778
- I know a ton of moves now.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.014
This is called a stationary.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.949
We're going to breathe in, go--

16:58.018 --> 16:58.983
- [blows raspberry]
- And then go on--

16:59.052 --> 17:01.019
[laughter]
- I hate you.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.789
- Hey, hey.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.057
- 2, 3, 4.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.025
There we go.

17:07.093 --> 17:10.228
- Hey!

17:10.296 --> 17:11.295
- Do--someone else go next.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.330
It's hard.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.364
- Bend your knees a little bit.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.333
Open your legs a little bit.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.602
OK, now open your mouth.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.037
[laughter]

17:19.105 --> 17:20.204
- Malleable.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.939
- There you go.
- There you go!

17:22.008 --> 17:23.941
Yay!

17:24.010 --> 17:27.512
[cheering]

17:27.580 --> 17:29.180
- Congratulations.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.782
You're dancing
without the stars.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.334
- Look, they're here.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.935
- We are going to dinner.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.337
- Fried shrimp.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.872
The Po Boy.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.041
You know, all the finest that
this particular geographic

19:06.446 --> 19:07.445
- Hello.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.646
- Just like old times.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.281
I'm the first one ready.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.450
I'm the one that takes
25 minutes to do my hair.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.784
You can relate to me, my dude.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.753
Anyway, my hair's on point.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.221
Literally.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.391
Yo, if it ain't
the dancing queen himself.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.392
Yo.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.027
- Hey.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.028
Yo, we starving, man.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.363
- Yeah, me too.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.497
- We just rolled in, man.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.498
- You look great.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.499
- Oh, thanks.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.534
- Good to see you.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.002
- Team Wow in the building.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.436
- Hello, beautiful.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.504
- What's up, man?
- How you been?

19:33.573 --> 19:34.505
- What's going on?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.606
- Good to see you.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.277
- Who is it?
- It's Ange.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.311
- Hi.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.580
- Oh, it's Angeliners.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.814
- Do you have wine for me?
- We do.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.049
- Here.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.450
There's mad [bleep]
going on right now.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.818
- What do you mean
there's mad [bleep]?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.554
- Hold on.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.756
- Angelina's been drinking
all day,

19:51.824 --> 19:54.358
and I already know this
is not going to end well.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.327
- Mike has been coming at me,
obviously, you guys know,

19:56.396 --> 19:57.528
on Twitter.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.430
He said I should
have been a felon.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.465
I thought I was going
to have to [bleep] go ham.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.500
<i> I'll admit it.</i>

20:02.569 --> 20:03.868
Mike and I had an agreement

20:03.937 --> 20:05.369
to go at each other on Twitter.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.338
<i> But calling me a felon?</i>

20:07.407 --> 20:09.540
You hit below the belt
really hard, Mike.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.142
- I knew you were
going to have to go ham.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.510
- I thought I was going to go
Karate Kid

20:12.579 --> 20:13.778
on some mother[bleep].

20:13.846 --> 20:15.680
- If you're that upset,
then there is going

20:15.748 --> 20:16.647
to have to be a discussion.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.648
- [bleep] yeah, I will.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.950
- But like, just you two.

20:19.052 --> 20:19.951
- I will.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.385
- Where's Miss Deena?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.787
- Oh, we were all just
getting ready for dinner.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.322
- Oh, yeah, and Angelina.
- Yeah.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.123
- Angelina been drinking
all day.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.760
She dropped the F-bomb
19 times before she made it

20:29.829 --> 20:31.762
from the door to the couch.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.797
She's a little like--

20:32.865 --> 20:34.232
- She happy?
- I don't know.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.433
- Oh, my God.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.201
I will [bleep] flip
the [bleep] out.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.670
- Angelina clearly
isn't changing her tune.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.472
I'm ready to get out
of this [bleep] hotel

20:41.541 --> 20:42.940
and see New Orleans.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.175
You know, she's been drinking
all day.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.543
<i> So I'm starving.</i>

20:45.612 --> 20:47.345
<i> Let's go to dinner,</i>
<i> and hopefully</i>

20:47.413 --> 20:48.579
this will be
a tomorrow problem.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.547
- Hey, what's up, bitches?

20:49.616 --> 20:50.581
- Hello.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.649
- Hey!
- Hi.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.650
- Hi, beautiful.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.185
- Hi.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.454
- All right, now that I get
everybody here, let's go.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.290
all: First night in NOLA!

20:59.359 --> 21:00.958
- Cheers, bitches.

21:01.060 --> 21:01.959
- Yeah, Vin.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.461
- Oh, my God.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.096
- You guys are going to like
what I got in store

21:05.164 --> 21:06.197
for you tonight.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.198
- I can't see
where we're going.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.266
- I know.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.267
I know.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.501
- It's getting weird back here.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.103
- Angelina's playing
with Mike's nipples.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.739
- You're surprisingly
in good energies these days.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.940
- No.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.375
- I--no?

21:17.443 --> 21:19.110
Why is the answer no?

21:19.178 --> 21:21.012
- Well, it was like
the Twitter thing.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.547
And like recently, I was like,
what the [bleep] is going on?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.149
Like--

21:25.218 --> 21:27.652
- Oh, God, I'm going to need
a lot of wine for this [bleep].

21:27.720 --> 21:29.587
- But like,
we had a conversation--

21:29.656 --> 21:31.489
- I heard that
that was a thing.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.824
- We had a conversation.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.294
- Oh, my God.

21:36.362 --> 21:37.495
Here we go.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.300
- I don't feel like dealing
with this [bleep] tonight.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.402
- One of the fans said
it was a felony.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.403
And I'm like, no way.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.937
And I checked it, and it was.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.572
- This is awkward.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.940
- So I just threw it out there.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.542
And that's how that happened.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.379
- At Deena's house, I was ready
to go hard for Angelina.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.882
- Mike took it upon himself
to insert himself,

21:57.950 --> 22:00.718
out of nowhere, tweeting
bad stuff about me.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.421
- But then Mike checked me
with those texts.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.724
- Says right here,
"Let's tweet crazy."

22:06.793 --> 22:09.360
I said, "If I say anything
you don't like,

22:09.429 --> 22:11.495
just text me,
and I'll delete it."

22:11.564 --> 22:13.130
There's an agreement in place.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.433
- All I know is, I don't want
to get involved.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.502
- And then you came out with
some [bleep] really sensitive

22:18.571 --> 22:20.171
words that shouldn't be said.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.539
- Frankly, I never said--

22:21.607 --> 22:23.107
- Sensitive words that
shouldn't have been said.

22:23.176 --> 22:26.477
- Angelina and Mike take
this time in this car ride

22:26.546 --> 22:27.945
to hash out their beef.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.281
- And then there was probably
a miscommunication about

22:30.350 --> 22:32.416
the arrangement that we had.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.918
- What the actual [bleep]?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.286
- Upgrade.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.488
- There's a time and place,
and that is not now.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.689
- You can't flip
the table in advance.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.924
You got to wait
till the dinner.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.866
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

22:48.935 --> 22:50.935
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.203
Listen.
- Be positive.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.738
- No, I'm being positive.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.005
- Mike,
that's the beignet place.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.207
- Oh, my God,
the beignet place.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.208
I love that place.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.776
- Are we done?

22:58.845 --> 22:59.744
Are we just moving on then?

22:59.812 --> 23:00.911
- No.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.046
I do understand
what you're saying.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.414
- You see what he's doing?

23:03.483 --> 23:04.648
- You're saying that
there was an argument that

23:04.717 --> 23:05.916
had nothing to do with us.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.651
- I'm just airing
everything out to Mike.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.154
And I feel like Mike
always tries to discredit

23:10.223 --> 23:12.156
my feelings all the time.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.357
- I do. I do. I do.
- You took

23:13.426 --> 23:14.358
the low-hanging fruit.
- And I took it

23:14.427 --> 23:15.459
because it was an opportunity--

23:15.528 --> 23:16.460
- The low-hanging fruit,
like a [bleep]

23:16.529 --> 23:17.628
goddamn banana.
- Yes.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.063
- He's just trying
to just brush it off

23:19.132 --> 23:20.131
like it's not a big deal,

23:20.199 --> 23:21.632
<i> but I know it's a big deal.</i>

23:21.701 --> 23:22.867
- Let's not dismiss
her feelings.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.201
- No.
- She was very offended.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.236
- I was.
- Yes.

23:25.338 --> 23:26.604
- Very upset.

23:26.672 --> 23:30.040
I explained that we can't
take away her feelings.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.342
- Yes.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.210
I feel that it's not over.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.046
I feel that
there's something brewing.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.649
This is like the calm
before the storm.

23:38.718 --> 23:43.154
- Yo, let's roll out for
some authentic NOLA cuisine.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.955
- All right, we're here.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.091
- Yeah, so I set up something
real nice out here in NOLA,

23:47.160 --> 23:49.593
a nice, authentic meal
for night one.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.795
Follow me.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.797
- Authentic dinner.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.033
It's probably gator bites,
frog legs, you know,

23:56.102 --> 23:58.369
some shrimp,
a little bit of gumbo.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.804
Holy [bleep].

23:59.872 --> 24:01.739
The Italian Barrel?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.707
- This is authentic NOLA food,
right here.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.109
- I thought we were
getting oysters.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.610
- We are. Follow me.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.412
- The last time I came
to New Orleans, I couldn't eat.

24:08.481 --> 24:09.947
- Fried gator bites?

24:10.016 --> 24:10.948
- We have raw oysters.

24:11.017 --> 24:11.949
- Oh, Pauly loves these.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.317
- Nasty.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.618
Hey, you guys remember
how much of a hard time

24:14.687 --> 24:16.520
I had last time
we came to NOLA?

24:16.589 --> 24:17.855
I couldn't eat because
it's all seafood.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.123
I had to take it
into my own hands.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.325
So I got you guys some Italian.

24:21.427 --> 24:22.927
Pauly D. needs to eat.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.028
- You can't go wrong
with Italian.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.196
- That's right.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.597
- Guys, I have
a little announcement.

24:26.666 --> 24:27.832
- Oh, no.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.469
- I am on day eight
of No Nut November.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.803
- Oh.
[laughter]

24:32.872 --> 24:35.940
- Oh, we have to see
if we can fix that tonight.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.142
- Nothing.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.677
I haven't done anything.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.813
I heard somewhere
that, like, dance competitors

24:42.882 --> 24:45.549
didn't have sex
before they would compete.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.419
And I got eliminated,
but I still wanted to, like,

24:48.488 --> 24:50.921
maybe finish up
No Nut November.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.623
- You're going a whole month?
- I'm trying.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.191
I'm trying.
- Good for you.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.326
- Mind over matter.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.327
- Yeah.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.895
- [bleep] wacko.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.431
- I don't need to know when
you nut and when you don't nut,

25:00.500 --> 25:01.665
<i> nor do I care.</i>

25:01.734 --> 25:02.900
Mm-mm.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.302
- Cheers to no nuts.
- Cheers to no nuts.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.303
Salut.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.872
<i> - No, Vinny's got no shot.</i>

25:07.940 --> 25:10.140
He's definitely not
going to finish that.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.909
- All right, let's talk
about flat Earth again.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.677
- Mike, do you still
believe in flat Earth?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.813
- No, but I think there
may be time travelers.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.948
- I do believe that,
straight up.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.316
I seriously do.

25:19.385 --> 25:20.451
- I do think that there
are time travelers.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.452
- Time travelers.
I really do.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.753
- Oh, I do. I do.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.821
Simpsons.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.789
- Yeah, that's a great example.

25:25.858 --> 25:26.891
- How the [bleep] does that--

25:26.959 --> 25:28.025
- They predict everything.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.560
You can't tell me they don't.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.563
- Am I putting an
aluminum foil on my head?

25:32.632 --> 25:35.833
No, I wouldn't say I'm that far
of a conspiracy theorist.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.736
But I believe in some stuff.

25:38.804 --> 25:39.904
[bell dings]

25:39.972 --> 25:41.338
- Well, I predicted
Angelina's divorce

25:41.407 --> 25:42.339
the day she got married.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.607
- We all did that, girlfriend.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.708
- He said that.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.043
- When she touches
Vinny's [bleep]

25:46.112 --> 25:47.011
on the day of the wedding,
I knew they were doomed.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.279
- I just fell.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.280
I just fell into your D.
I didn't mean it.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.948
- There you go. Whoa.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.283
Whoa, she just grabbed
my [bleep]!

25:52.351 --> 25:54.251
- No, she did not.
- Ahh!

25:54.320 --> 25:56.687
- Angelina, why did you pick
your boyfriend

25:56.756 --> 25:57.821
that has the same name
as Vinny?

25:57.890 --> 25:58.822
Same city and everything.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.924
- I didn't try that [bleep].

25:59.992 --> 26:01.358
It just happened.

26:01.427 --> 26:02.726
- Yeah, but like,
some people have a type,

26:02.795 --> 26:04.495
and your type is Vinny.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.829
- He's very different from you.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.565
- Oh, Vin, she said that
with passion.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.433
- Two totally different people.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.769
Unfortunately,
have the same name,

26:11.837 --> 26:14.305
and from the same [bleep] town,
and have the same birthday,

26:14.373 --> 26:17.107
and their mothers have
the same birthday as well.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.876
Yeah, they're not
the same person, though.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.010
[laughs]

26:20.079 --> 26:21.211
- Are we ever
going to meet him?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.813
- She's always liked
douchebags.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.281
- [laughs]

26:24.350 --> 26:26.317
- Oh, that was a heckle,
like a witch.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.651
Angelina didn't miss
her flight because

26:27.720 --> 26:29.286
she took a broomstick
to get here.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.589
[laughter]

26:31.657 --> 26:32.856
- If I would have said that,
she would have

26:32.925 --> 26:34.725
punched me in the face.
- I know.

26:34.794 --> 26:35.859
Threw the water on you.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.428
- I've made that joke
80,000 times.

26:37.530 --> 26:38.896
- [bleep] off, you [bleep].

26:38.965 --> 26:41.265
- Angelina, you should do
No Swear November.

26:41.334 --> 26:42.433
- Yeah.

26:42.535 --> 26:43.601
- I cannot last--

26:43.669 --> 26:45.569
- Let's get a swear jar.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.605
- [bleep] Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.073
- Watch your mouth.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.107
- We'll be rich.

27:05.558 --> 27:06.690
- Chicken parmesan.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.958

a bottle of wine, or--

Thank you.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.069

- Thank you so much.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.354
We've got to go back to Italy.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.756
- Can I please go
with you guys?

27:38.824 --> 27:39.923
Because I've never been there.
- I didn't appreciate it.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.425
- I'd love that.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.760
- I was just gonna say that.
I was like, I wanna go back.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.428
I feel like we would
appreciate it more now.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.230
We went through a lot
of [bleep].

27:46.298 --> 27:47.331

a lot together.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.599

A lot happened in Italy.

[doorbell rings]

27:54.707 --> 27:55.906
- Hi.
- Hey, Cynthia.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.174
How are you?
- How are you?

27:57.243 --> 27:58.175
- I'm good.
How are you?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.743
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I am.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.779
You know, I think I feel like
I needed a change of scenery

28:01.847 --> 28:04.381
and a change of just pace
in my life.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.617
<i> So I decided to move</i>
<i> from LA to Miami.</i>

28:06.686 --> 28:08.118
And I opened up a new business.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.554
It's going to be a sneaker
store called Sneaker Clinic.

28:10.623 --> 28:11.989
<i> You know, it's just something</i>
<i> that I've always been into,</i>

28:12.058 --> 28:13.290
<i> and it's a passion of mine.</i>

28:13.359 --> 28:14.792
- And do you want to leave
everything in the house?

28:14.860 --> 28:16.160
You want to sell it furnished?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.195
- Let me find out
what I'm going

28:18.264 --> 28:20.197
to move into when I get there,
because I'm looking at houses.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.732
I'm looking at condos.
- OK.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.969
- The last couple of years,
I was in a bad situation.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.138
<i> I almost lost</i>
<i> everything that I built.</i>

28:28.207 --> 28:29.640

- Let's go.

<i> I almost lost my daughter,</i>
<i> and I was in treatment</i>

28:33.079 --> 28:34.878
for eight or nine months,
but it helped me grow,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.313

a stronger person.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.449
<i> Depression is something</i>
<i> that I suffer with,</i>

28:38.517 --> 28:41.819

realized, like, I need help.

<i> to fly in?</i>

28:43.956 --> 28:45.289
- As soon as possible.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.423
I'm going to miss
the neighborhood, though.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.591
I love it around here.
- I know.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.093
- It's so quiet.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.695
Now I have full custody
of my daughter.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.696
- Daddy!

28:52.765 --> 28:54.465
- Yes.

- Yeah, help me pack your toys.

<i> what, four years now?</i>

29:13.819 --> 29:14.752
<i> Almost five.</i>

29:14.820 --> 29:15.953
- Yeah, almost five.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.287
<i> - When you decided</i>
<i> that you just</i>

29:26.632 --> 29:28.632
- It's been a crazy, you know,
five years.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.169
- I got to get mama bear home.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.737
Are you guys doing
anything tonight?

29:33.806 --> 29:35.572
- We're going to go
to a bar, I feel.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.108
- Dirty stay-outs out,
dirty stay-ins in.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.143
- Thank you so much
for everything.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.310
- Thank you.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.812
- All right, dirty stay-outs,
have fun.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.313
- You two are nuts.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.416
I'm the only normal person
in this group.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.185
- A little bit tired.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.987
- A bitch is tired.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.091

29:54.160 --> 29:55.259
I will be sleeping.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.260
- The food was amazing.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.462
- I'm in a food coma, for sure.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.063

30:21.220 --> 30:22.820

- You know what, it was--

30:22.888 --> 30:24.021
- I think it was--

30:24.089 --> 30:26.557
- It was a really
mature conversation.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.659
I--it was very unexpected.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.528
I just hope that she remembers
how good of a conversation

30:31.597 --> 30:32.796
we were having.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.970
- Over the past 10 years,

30:40.039 --> 30:42.472
a lot of the exchanges

have been super fiery.

30:44.710 --> 30:45.742
- Get out of my face.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.077
- You dirty little hamster.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.612

on crack, you big jerkoff.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.147
- Popeye on crack.
Oh, my God.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.715
- I try to be all nice
to everybody

30:51.784 --> 30:52.749
in this [...] house.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.818
- You're a [...] loser.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.153
- But it's my mess.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.187
- It always is your mess.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.355
- You guys got history.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.857
- Yeah, we got
a little bit of history.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.658
Your life is
a [bleep] dumpster fire.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.160
You know,
at the end of the day,

31:03.229 --> 31:05.128
you know, old Sitch is still
in there, and he's like...

31:05.197 --> 31:06.630
I got the receipts, kid.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.265
[bleep] around...

31:08.334 --> 31:10.100

- You're going to find out.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.301
You know what I'm saying?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.804
So if you want the smoke,
free smoke.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.912
- And talk like normal people,
not like assholes.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.383
- Bourbon Street.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.517
Get it, girl.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.886
Come on, girl.

31:32.625 --> 31:35.259
- Hey, Ange,
can you move this guy out?

31:35.327 --> 31:36.727
No! Stop it!

31:36.795 --> 31:38.729
- What a waste of cake.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.364
What a waste of cake.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.378
<i> - ♪ When we swagger</i>

31:54.446 --> 31:55.479
- Let's go to your room.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.613
I got to talk to you
about something.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.515
- Yeah?

31:58.584 --> 32:01.652
- So this guy wants to do this
gender reveal out here, right?

32:01.720 --> 32:02.986
- Yeah.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.521
I thought he was, like,
planning it or something.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.722
- Right, but he's not, so we
got to take the reins on this.

32:05.791 --> 32:06.857
- OK.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.258
- But do you remember
he said he wanted

32:08.327 --> 32:09.559
to jump out of a plane?
He wanted to do it real big.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.129
- I would think about
jumping out of a plane.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.530
- Why don't we do that?

32:13.599 --> 32:16.066
- If we do this, though,
and plan this,

32:16.135 --> 32:19.002
you can't tell him, because
he's going to tell Lauren,

32:19.071 --> 32:20.370
and Lauren's not going
to let him do it.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.638
- Right.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.373
<i> - I'm more scared</i>

32:23.442 --> 32:25.008

32:25.077 --> 32:26.843

32:26.912 --> 32:28.679
- Mike, you need
to get in here.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.047
Put all this in my bag.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.415
We have to pick
our wedding song.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.916
Honey, can you
just get him out?

32:32.985 --> 32:35.252
- If she finds out about this,
it's not going to work.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.721
You have to almost, like,
take him away from Lauren,

32:37.790 --> 32:40.223
get him on the plane,
and then tell him.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.325
- Yeah.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.693
- We'll plan
a whole other thing,

32:42.761 --> 32:45.362
but really, we'll take him
to jump out of a plane.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.565
- Yes, and reveal
the gender of his second baby.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.267
- We all know it's a girl,
but I still want to see

32:50.336 --> 32:51.368
Mike jump out of a plane.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.536
- Operation Distract Mike.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.071
- Lit.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.275
- I love this song.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.881
- [bleep]. Wait.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.483
Let's make sure my phone--

33:06.552 --> 33:07.918
I have it.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.152

33:16.662 --> 33:17.828
- No.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.597
Let's go.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.666
I'm going to probably
bust my ass right now.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.134
- Oh, my God.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.369
- This way, bitch.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.104
- Guys, this way.
- My balls.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.438
- Just heads up.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.040
- Guys, I'm going to--
- Ange.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.575
- I'm going to show my balls
right now.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.276
OK, we're here.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.578
Dirty stay-outs.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.612
Let's do it.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.447
I hate this [bleep] guy.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.349
[bleep] idiots.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.389

33:51.697 --> 33:56.133
Hey, Ange, can you
move this guy out?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.501
No, move him out.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.803
Not that--no, stop it.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.271
- Oh!

34:01.340 --> 34:05.075
What a waste of cake.
What a waste of cake.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.276
- Now I have to [bleep]
do this.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.277
- OK, uh--

34:07.346 --> 34:09.212
- What a waste of cake.

34:09.281 --> 34:12.049
What a waste of cake.
What a waste of cake.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.417
- All right,
so how are we supposed to--

34:13.485 --> 34:14.985
we can't keep it here?
I'm not going to keep it--

34:15.054 --> 34:17.988
- [vocalizing] I didn't do it.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.523
- Who do you think you are,
Steve Aoki?

34:19.591 --> 34:20.891
- Ooh.
- No.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.859
Please stop.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.362
- I'm glad
you think it's funny.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.863
- What a waste of cake.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.399
- This is not
what I should be doing.

34:29.468 --> 34:32.803
She's fricking making a mess
of a room.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.971
I don't like that.
- Oh, [bleep].

34:35.040 --> 34:36.239
- Like,
you should clean this up.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.441
I'm not cleaning this up.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.142
- I didn't--[laughs]

34:39.211 --> 34:40.444
- Chris, let's go.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.945
- What a waste of cake.
- Why'd you spill it?

34:42.014 --> 34:43.213
- We're going to bed.
- I have to go to bed too.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.281
- No.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.282
Who's supposed to
clean that up now?

34:45.350 --> 34:46.349
- My [bleep].

34:46.418 --> 34:47.350
- Oh.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.618
That's not nice.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.921
- We had a really great night,
but Angelina

34:50.989 --> 34:51.922
is all over the place.

34:51.990 --> 34:53.190
I just had enough.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.193
- What a fun night,
dirty stay-outs.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.928
- I think it's time for bed.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.096
- Goodnight, guys.
- Goodnight.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.297
- Goodnight, Ange.
- Love you.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.466
- Wait, I think
I'm on the same floor.

35:02.534 --> 35:03.733
- I need to [bleep] sleep.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.235
- Really?

35:05.304 --> 35:06.903
Shut the [bleep] up, Ange,
'cause our kids are sleeping.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.239
- I love you guys,
but like, I understand.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.942
Where's my [bleep] room?

35:12.010 --> 35:13.577
I have to pee.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.078
Where is it?

35:15.147 --> 35:17.180
I thought it was the other
way, but it's not.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.520
- Come on, Chris.
Get it.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.255
- What do you want me to do
if the key don't work?

35:25.324 --> 35:26.256
- Just--

35:26.325 --> 35:27.357
- This is our key.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.292
It doesn't work.

35:30.195 --> 35:32.195
- I gotta pee.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.397
So annoying as [bleep].

35:34.466 --> 35:36.266
Am I an asshole?

35:36.335 --> 35:38.768
I'm going to pee my pants.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.471
- Chris, maybe you're
not putting it on right.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.106

in the handle.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.641
I'll Pauly D. this [bleep].

35:44.710 --> 35:47.043
I call hotel security,
they're going to have to come.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.178

35:48.247 --> 35:51.114
Now we're talking, in the pool.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.224
I have to pee.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.959
- If we just came back here
after dinner,

36:03.028 --> 36:04.861
the battery would
still be alive.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.429
We'd be able to get in.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.430
- Pool is closed.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.899
You can't do that.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.680

Get it, girl.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.923
Is that a prostitute?

38:13.992 --> 38:15.725
That's a prostitute.

38:15.827 --> 38:16.760
Thank you.

38:16.862 --> 38:17.761
- You're welcome.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.429
- Come on, girl.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.964
<i> So I'm finally in Noler.</i>

38:21.033 --> 38:24.134
I know I mixed the day up,
but now I'm ready.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.468
Where am I at?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.504
Ma'am?
Is this the right way?

38:27.572 --> 38:29.873
Oh, my God.
Is this the right way?

38:31.543 --> 38:34.277
- [retching]

38:36.882 --> 38:37.847
Ugh.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.516
I woke up this morning

38:39.584 --> 38:41.885
feeling like death.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.689
[retching]

38:45.757 --> 38:47.324
I don't feel good.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.259
What the [bleep] did I drink?

38:49.328 --> 38:50.293
<i> - ♪ I am invincible ♪</i>

38:50.362 --> 38:51.861
<i> ♪ Ain't no one stopping me ♪</i>

38:51.930 --> 38:53.396
<i> ♪ I live my vision because</i>
<i> this is my prophecy ♪</i>

38:53.465 --> 38:54.898
<i> ♪ I am a king of the jungle,</i>
<i> your highness ♪</i>

38:54.966 --> 38:56.833
<i> ♪ I swing from vine to vine</i>
<i> in any climate ♪</i>

38:56.902 --> 38:58.702
<i> ♪ Beat on my chest,</i>
<i> then I scream out my lungs ♪</i>

38:58.770 --> 39:00.370
<i> ♪ I am the beast</i>
<i> that they don't want to hunt ♪</i>

39:00.439 --> 39:01.871
<i> ♪ Never believe I ♪</i>
<i> [music winds down, stops]</i>

39:01.940 --> 39:04.507
- [bleep].
[whimpering]

39:04.576 --> 39:06.343
- Last night was fun.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.744
- Yeah, it was good food.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.279
- I did not know they could do
Italian like that.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.413
- Yeah.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.448
- I thought
it was a nice dinner.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.083
- Last night was good.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.784
Angelina and Mike
started having

39:14.886 --> 39:16.386
that conversation in the car.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.321
- That conversation in
the back of the van,

39:18.390 --> 39:19.589
though, was so weird.

39:19.658 --> 39:20.990
- What did you think
about the vibes?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.726
I thought the vibes were great.
- Oh, please.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.928
<i> - After my conversation</i>
<i> with Angelina,</i>

39:24.996 --> 39:27.197
I'm feeling that
she doesn't want the smoke.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.766
And I wouldn't want it either,

39:29.835 --> 39:32.402
if you knew the receipts
that I got.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.570
And I have the receipts here.

39:33.638 --> 39:38.375
On September 30, 5:51 p.m.,

39:38.443 --> 39:40.944
she said, "Let's tweet crazy."

39:41.012 --> 39:42.412
- It sounds like a trap.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.646
- I feel like
they're going to have

39:43.715 --> 39:45.382
to have another conversation.

39:45.450 --> 39:46.616
- You're playing her game.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.118
<i> - I probably shouldn't</i>
<i> have engaged</i>

39:48.186 --> 39:50.353
because I knew that she was
going to come around the back

39:50.422 --> 39:51.688
and betray me.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.023
But Angelina has no leg
to stand on right now.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.427
You're playing victim in
the story that you created.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.129
You don't want this smoke.
All right?

39:59.197 --> 40:03.166
The toll in Jersey
is to tell the truth,

40:03.235 --> 40:05.235
and you've got lie-abetes.

40:05.303 --> 40:08.371
In this particular situation,
I just want to be heard.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.640
- She's just always
on the defense.

40:10.709 --> 40:14.244
So like, even if the smallest
thing happens, like,

40:14.312 --> 40:15.812
instead of being like, OK,

40:15.881 --> 40:18.481
rationalize it,
and let's talk through it,

40:18.550 --> 40:21.384
she's like, I'm going
to [bleep] this person up.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.552
- Oh, my God.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.753
- 3-0.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.255
This way.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.992
I have to go up 99 rooms?

40:29.060 --> 40:30.760
I think I'm going
the wrong way.

40:30.829 --> 40:31.795
I'll handle it, honey.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.230
I'll handle it,
like I always do.

40:34.299 --> 40:37.300
If she wants to fight,
like, old Sitch is ready.

40:37.369 --> 40:40.437
Remember, honey,
if Angelina lunges at you,

40:40.505 --> 40:43.339
just stop, drop, and roll.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.241
- I just look really bad.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.211
Why is this such a far walk?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.879
3-0.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.748
Could you just tell me
where to go?

40:51.817 --> 40:53.149
This is annoying.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.422
- Yo, Godfather.
I have to get what you want.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.890
- This is your gender reveal.

41:00.959 --> 41:01.991
- So you jumping out of the
orange one or the white one?

41:02.060 --> 41:03.293
- This is all
under the direction

41:03.361 --> 41:04.694
of Pauly DelVecchio.

41:04.763 --> 41:05.762
- I'm going to [bleep]
kill you.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.797
- My wife is going to flip out.

41:07.866 --> 41:08.798
- They're in the air.
- No.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.300
- My wife's going to kill me.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.868
- I will kill Mike.
- She's going to start crying.

41:11.937 --> 41:12.869
- No!

41:12.938 --> 41:14.070
- Oh, my God.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.238
- Wait a minute.
[screaming]

41:15.307 --> 41:16.906
- Let's go, let's go.
- Oh, my God.
