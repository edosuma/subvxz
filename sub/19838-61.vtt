<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

00:04.990 --> 00:06.690
<b><i>By using...</i></b>

00:06.690 --> 00:07.570
<b><i>words?</i></b>

00:12.010 --> 00:13.100
<b>King...</b>

00:15.450 --> 00:18.410
<b>Would you like to know your name?</b>

00:21.230 --> 00:24.620
<b>How would you know my name?</b>

00:30.380 --> 00:34.800
<b>My subordinates were present at the 
moment of your mother's passing.</b>

00:37.630 --> 00:41.010
<b>She uttered your name with her dying breath.</b>

00:42.330 --> 00:47.340
<b>And my subordinates may have died 
fighting your Royal Guard by now.</b>

00:54.110 --> 00:56.380
<b>Interested in fighting me now?</b>

00:59.950 --> 01:03.720
<b>If you can force me to admit defeat,</b>

01:03.720 --> 01:06.240
<b>I will tell you your name.</b>

01:09.130 --> 01:13.310
<b>Force you to admit defeat without killing you?</b>

01:18.190 --> 01:21.060
<b>So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...</b>

01:43.700 --> 01:44.770
<b>No matter.</b>

01:44.770 --> 01:47.040
<b>I shall checkmate you shortly.</b>

03:30.980 --> 03:35.980
<b>Centipede x And x Memory</b>

03:41.860 --> 03:48.020
<b>As the King and Netero prepared 
for their final battle...</b>

04:15.330 --> 04:20.030
<b>Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing,</b>

04:20.470 --> 04:24.960
<b>having failed to finish off 
the unconscious Brovada.</b>

05:13.540 --> 05:16.030
<b><i>Fire! This is the best option!</i></b>

05:17.180 --> 05:20.180
<b><i>There's no one else to help me!</i></b>

05:21.580 --> 05:22.590
<b><i>I h-have to...</i></b>

05:24.810 --> 05:25.840
<b><i>kill him!</i></b>

05:32.920 --> 05:34.600
<b><i>This is no time to be crying...</i></b>

05:35.080 --> 05:36.680
<b><i>I have to find Palm!</i></b>

05:37.140 --> 05:37.810
<b>Huh?</b>

05:38.980 --> 05:41.370
<b><i>The door to the warehouse area is open.</i></b>

05:42.620 --> 05:44.570
<b><i>So is the door leading to the garage!</i></b>

05:45.190 --> 05:46.150
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

05:46.580 --> 05:47.530
<b>Don't move!</b>

05:52.080 --> 05:53.830
<b>If you move, I'll attack.</b>

05:58.490 --> 05:59.580
<b><i>Welfin...</i></b>

06:00.270 --> 06:03.840
<b>I have a lot of things to ask you.</b>

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
<b>If you seem to be trying anything funny,</b>

06:06.430 --> 06:07.430
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

06:09.230 --> 06:11.440
<b><i>What he wants to ask me</i></b>

06:12.150 --> 06:13.050
<b><i>is obvious!</i></b>

06:14.170 --> 06:15.450
<b><i>The number of my allies,</i></b>

06:15.900 --> 06:16.960
<b><i>their roles,</i></b>

06:17.680 --> 06:19.100
<b><i>and their abilities.</i></b>

06:19.860 --> 06:23.360
<b><i>And he intends to use any means 
necessary to get the answers.</i></b>

06:24.570 --> 06:28.490
<b><i>People could die if I leak information.</i></b>

06:29.750 --> 06:31.350
<b><i>If he's a Manipulator,</i></b>

06:31.990 --> 06:34.780
<b><i>he can obtain the information against my will.</i></b>

06:37.880 --> 06:38.580
<b>Huh?</b>

06:38.950 --> 06:40.250
<b>D-Don't move!</b>

06:40.250 --> 06:41.500
<b>I really will kill you!</b>

06:41.650 --> 06:43.420
<b><i>Go ahead... Kill me.</i></b>

06:43.420 --> 06:44.250
<b><i>That's what I want!</i></b>

06:44.740 --> 06:45.750
<b>Stop!</b>

06:45.750 --> 06:47.760
<b><i>If the alternative is betraying my buddies,</i></b>

06:48.320 --> 06:49.210
<b><i>I'll take you with me!</i></b>

06:49.880 --> 06:51.570
<b>Ouch!</b>

06:52.150 --> 06:53.890
<b>Bastard! Now you've done it!</b>

06:54.870 --> 06:55.890
<b>Damn it!</b>

06:56.200 --> 06:57.360
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

06:57.680 --> 06:58.760
<b><i>Missile Man!</i></b>

07:06.780 --> 07:08.530
<b><i>I'm... not dead...</i></b>

07:09.630 --> 07:10.930
<b><i>I didn't sustain any damage.</i></b>

07:11.650 --> 07:13.950
<b><i>What was that attack?</i></b>

07:14.210 --> 07:17.200
<b>Damn, that hurts...</b>

07:17.680 --> 07:19.420
<b>You little punk...</b>

07:19.420 --> 07:21.960
<b>Damn...</b>

07:22.550 --> 07:28.210
<b><i>That bastard... How did a wimp like 
that figure out my weakness?</i></b>

07:28.680 --> 07:31.620
<b><i>Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.</i></b>

07:31.620 --> 07:35.860
<b><i>If an enemy attacks before I can ask 
a question, it's null and void!</i></b>

07:36.690 --> 07:38.110
<b><i>The wound isn't deep...</i></b>

07:41.100 --> 07:43.530
<b><i>I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.</i></b>

07:50.150 --> 07:50.850
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

08:01.470 --> 08:04.750
<b><i>He planted something inside me?</i></b>

08:06.850 --> 08:10.830
<b>Those were created by my <i>Nen</i>.</b>

08:11.330 --> 08:12.630
<b>They're black centipedes.</b>

08:13.550 --> 08:15.630
<b>Black Centipede</b>

08:16.550 --> 08:20.140
<b>They grow by feeding on your resistance.</b>

08:27.190 --> 08:32.450
<b>If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,</b>

08:33.050 --> 08:35.910
<b>you'll suffer excruciating pain,</b>

08:36.310 --> 08:39.570
<b>then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!</b>

08:48.670 --> 08:50.950
<b>Wh-What are you doing, fool?</b>

08:50.950 --> 08:52.900
<b>Weren't you listening to me?</b>

08:53.280 --> 08:56.240
<b>If you try to do that...</b>

09:05.000 --> 09:06.790
<b>That's fine with me.</b>

09:08.010 --> 09:10.100
<b>If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!</b>

09:15.040 --> 09:16.570
<b>S-Stop!</b>

09:24.320 --> 09:25.830
<b><i>No, wait...</i></b>

09:26.660 --> 09:30.860
<b><i>If he wanted to kill me, that's the 
ultimate form of resistance.</i></b>

09:31.690 --> 09:36.850
<b><i>Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes 
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!</i></b>

09:43.820 --> 09:45.260
<b>Don't worry.</b>

09:45.780 --> 09:47.260
<b>I'm not interested in killing you...</b>

09:48.320 --> 09:51.490
<b>I just need to make sure that you can't leave.</b>

09:54.340 --> 09:55.480
<b>I still...</b>

09:56.050 --> 09:57.110
<b>have plenty of bullets.</b>

10:00.930 --> 10:02.870
<b>Bastard! Don't mess with me!</b>

10:03.260 --> 10:04.620
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

10:04.620 --> 10:07.020
<b>You're dead! I'll kill you!</b>

10:31.980 --> 10:33.710
<b><i>It's so easy.</i></b>

10:39.760 --> 10:42.660
<b><i>When I'm prepared to offer my own life,</i></b>

10:43.360 --> 10:47.480
<b><i>it's so easy to pull the trigger.</i></b>

11:28.810 --> 11:30.000
<b>I g-get it...</b>

11:30.000 --> 11:31.080
<b>I get it, already.</b>

11:31.080 --> 11:32.540
<b>I won't go anywhere!</b>

11:35.290 --> 11:36.260
<b>I surrender.</b>

11:36.260 --> 11:38.300
<b>Please... Don't fire!</b>

11:42.550 --> 11:44.440
<b><i>The pain is going away.</i></b>

11:44.440 --> 11:46.570
<b><i>The creatures inside me are suffering?</i></b>

11:47.470 --> 11:49.810
<b>I lose, damn it...</b>

11:50.970 --> 11:53.310
<b>I can't move anymore.</b>

11:54.630 --> 11:57.910
<b><i>Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?</i></b>

12:03.040 --> 12:05.760
<b>Man, I knew it...</b>

12:06.280 --> 12:08.780
<b>I had a feeling this would happen eventually.</b>

12:10.670 --> 12:12.350
<b><i>But still...</i></b>

12:12.350 --> 12:15.740
<b><i>I didn't think I was this weak!</i></b>

12:15.740 --> 12:19.480
<b><i>I didn't think it'd be so scary 
to face someone who fights</i></b>

12:19.480 --> 12:21.970
<b><i>with no regard for their own life!</i></b>

12:23.470 --> 12:24.310
<b>Hey.</b>

12:24.680 --> 12:25.620
<b>What?</b>

12:26.230 --> 12:30.850
<b>The pain has stopped, but can 
you get rid of these bugs?</b>

12:32.070 --> 12:33.800
<b><i>Stop complaining...</i></b>

12:33.800 --> 12:36.970
<b><i>I'm in too much pain to think about that now!</i></b>

12:43.890 --> 12:45.340
<b>Hurry up.</b>

12:45.770 --> 12:47.870
<b>Give me a minute!</b>

12:48.800 --> 12:52.990
<b><i>I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.</i></b>

12:53.490 --> 12:57.050
<b><i>But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble...</i></b>

12:57.560 --> 13:00.130
<b><i>Damn, how do I get out of this?</i></b>

13:03.690 --> 13:05.480
<b><i>I need to buy time...</i></b>

13:05.820 --> 13:08.300
<b><i>Until I can come up with a good idea.</i></b>

13:11.800 --> 13:14.830
<b>The pain is making me...</b>

13:15.400 --> 13:17.850
<b>feel faint...</b>

13:39.030 --> 13:40.370
<b>Wait! Okay!</b>

13:40.370 --> 13:42.470
<b>I was lying! I won't do it again!</b>

13:42.470 --> 13:44.540
<b>Then get rid of these.</b>

13:44.840 --> 13:46.900
<b>Yeah, uh...</b>

13:46.900 --> 13:49.430
<b>So, the thing is...</b>

13:55.950 --> 13:58.270
<b>Forget it. I see how it is.</b>

13:58.760 --> 14:00.310
<b>Wait! Hold on!</b>

14:00.680 --> 14:02.900
<b>I can't remove them!</b>

14:02.900 --> 14:04.570
<b>Not once they've been activated!</b>

14:08.000 --> 14:10.490
<b>That's why I didn't want to say anything.</b>

14:10.490 --> 14:13.010
<b>It's the truth! Believe me!</b>

14:13.010 --> 14:14.830
<b>I'm not trying to trick you!</b>

14:16.980 --> 14:19.440
<b><i>The insects are in pain again.</i></b>

14:20.270 --> 14:22.380
<b><i>Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?</i></b>

14:23.190 --> 14:24.790
<b>Can you really blame me?</b>

14:25.590 --> 14:29.030
<b>I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.</b>

14:29.030 --> 14:30.840
<b>I never cared what happened after that.</b>

14:31.520 --> 14:36.350
<b>I never gave any thought to 
what happened to my enemy.</b>

14:37.720 --> 14:40.680
<b><i>Nen</i> abilities are really something.</b>

14:41.150 --> 14:44.610
<b>My abilities reflect my own personality.</b>

14:45.570 --> 14:49.760
<b><i>My personality? His true intentions?</i></b>

14:51.270 --> 14:52.220
<b>Welfin...</b>

14:55.020 --> 14:56.570
<b><i>What do I ask him?</i></b>

14:57.310 --> 14:58.800
<b><i>What do I want to know?</i></b>

15:03.100 --> 15:05.470
<b><i>I once knew someone just like him.</i></b>

15:07.740 --> 15:11.090
<b>Do you have any memories from 
when you were human?</b>

15:11.580 --> 15:14.600
<b>Wh-Why are you asking about that?</b>

15:15.140 --> 15:16.790
<b>I can't remember...</b>

15:20.980 --> 15:22.150
<b>You're lying.</b>

15:23.270 --> 15:24.470
<b>Wh-What?</b>

15:24.470 --> 15:26.240
<b>Stop! Hold on!</b>

15:26.240 --> 15:27.030
<b>Calm down!</b>

15:28.330 --> 15:31.710
<b>If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you.</b>

15:42.120 --> 15:44.440
<b>When I woke up,</b>

15:45.520 --> 15:47.520
<b>my first thought was...</b>

15:53.400 --> 15:54.900
<b>Damn...</b>

15:55.680 --> 15:58.600
<b>I can still remember it.</b>

16:08.270 --> 16:12.760
<b>I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.</b>

16:23.210 --> 16:28.780
<b>I was fed to the Queen, 
and reborn as something new...</b>

16:32.750 --> 16:33.840
<b>But I still...</b>

16:34.920 --> 16:39.970
<b>I still remember the one thing 
I most wanted to forget.</b>

16:44.920 --> 16:47.280
<b>The sight of my father strangling me,</b>

16:48.660 --> 16:51.040
<b>and the woman watching behind him.</b>

16:56.000 --> 16:59.500
<b>At first, I only had flashbacks of it.</b>

17:00.270 --> 17:03.370
<b>Over time, I remembered the 
entire sequence of events.</b>

17:08.100 --> 17:10.130
<b>I was saved by...</b>

17:11.200 --> 17:13.990
<b>my little brother, who was unrelated by blood.</b>

17:17.830 --> 17:19.140
<b>I remember now!</b>

17:20.080 --> 17:23.260
<b>He looked just like Gyro!</b>

17:24.560 --> 17:25.530
<b>Gyro?</b>

17:26.230 --> 17:28.520
<b>You know. The king!</b>

17:31.640 --> 17:35.600
<b>We used to brag about whose 
life was more miserable.</b>

17:37.130 --> 17:40.810
<b>He was the only one I could 
turn to when I needed</b>

17:40.810 --> 17:42.540
<b>to laugh away my tears...</b>

17:43.930 --> 17:46.810
<b>We were both empty.</b>

17:47.850 --> 17:51.470
<b>So we had nothing to hide.</b>

17:57.460 --> 18:00.730
<b>I wonder what he's doing now...</b>

18:10.720 --> 18:14.570
<b>I want to see him one more time...</b>

18:36.300 --> 18:39.560
<b>Yes, I just want to see Gyro.</b>

18:41.390 --> 18:44.250
<b>I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,</b>

18:45.100 --> 18:48.730
<b>with money and nations...</b>

18:53.070 --> 18:54.200
<b>Go.</b>

18:54.910 --> 18:56.540
<b>The bugs are gone.</b>

18:57.280 --> 18:59.610
<b>You still have something to do.</b>

19:02.560 --> 19:05.620
<b>Why did you open the doors?</b>

19:07.210 --> 19:12.380
<b>Oh, I was letting those weaklings 
reach the treasure in the back.</b>

19:16.250 --> 19:18.600
<b>They can't put up much of a fight.</b>

19:19.830 --> 19:22.310
<b>I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.</b>

19:23.760 --> 19:26.890
<b>And I told them to pass while 
you were on the way back.</b>

19:37.840 --> 19:39.630
<b><i>A coward!</i></b>

19:41.900 --> 19:43.280
<b>It was that simple.</b>

19:46.060 --> 19:48.910
<b>Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,</b>

19:49.390 --> 19:51.920
<b>I thought you'd be an easy target.</b>

19:52.620 --> 19:54.890
<b>I couldn't have been more wrong.</b>

20:00.940 --> 20:02.140
<b>Go on.</b>

20:02.650 --> 20:04.260
<b>I'm too tired to move...</b>

20:04.920 --> 20:06.420
<b>I have one last question.</b>

20:08.060 --> 20:10.930
<b>Did you see a woman in the palace?</b>

20:11.360 --> 20:12.420
<b>A woman?</b>

20:13.840 --> 20:16.350
<b>Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,</b>

20:16.350 --> 20:20.840
<b>but the Royal Guard captured a human, 
and put her in a cocoon.</b>

20:21.590 --> 20:22.950
<b>Where is she?</b>

20:24.000 --> 20:26.410
<b>Take the elevator up, then turn left.</b>

20:26.910 --> 20:28.450
<b>It's the room at the end of the hall.</b>

20:29.620 --> 20:31.690
<b>They called it #1.</b>

20:33.130 --> 20:34.120
<b>Thank you!</b>

20:38.670 --> 20:39.960
<b>What's so funny?</b>

20:44.920 --> 20:47.220
<b>Telling the truth</b>

20:48.170 --> 20:50.930
<b>feels really good...</b>

20:55.730 --> 21:00.990
<b>Welfin had spent his life unable 
to trust himself or others.</b>

21:01.890 --> 21:06.820
<b>Telling Ikalgo the location of 
the one he searched for</b>

21:07.470 --> 21:11.950
<b>was the first time he'd opened 
up and spoken honestly.</b>

23:24.610 --> 23:26.840
<b>Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.</b>

23:28.250 --> 23:30.970
<b>I'm just... I'm just...</b>

23:30.970 --> 23:32.670
<b>What's wrong, Killua?</b>

23:32.670 --> 23:33.890
<b>I'm here for you.</b>
