00:02.602 --> 00:04.276
Honey, Mitchell helped me
pick out the shirt.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.908
You're gonna love it.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.816
Ooh, I wish I could
pick you up some lip gloss...

00:07.875 --> 00:09.821
but we're already at the car.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.379
Okay, bye, honey.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.981
♪♪ Getting pretty good, huh?

00:13.047 --> 00:15.152
Yeah, but you were always good.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.162
I'm just glad you stuck with it.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.061
- Seriously?
- What?

00:19.120 --> 00:22.624
- It's playing itself.
- Well, I didn't know.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.763
You honestly thought that
I just became a piano virtuoso, Dad?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.398
You've known me my whole life.
Have you ever seen me take a lesson?

00:29.463 --> 00:32.034
- I thought maybe you were self-taught.
- Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.079
- Like when I taught myself to play the clarinet.
- Exactly.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.945
- I never played the clarinet.
- Can we drop it?

00:37.004 --> 00:38.915
Let's go get an ice cream.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.817
- What about my lactose intolerance?
- Oh, I'm not loving this game.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.358
Oh, this sucks.
My teacher gave me mononucleosis.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.985
As a parent, I feel
I should ask about this.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.223
Slow down. it's not like she gets
that many tugs on the line.

00:51.285 --> 00:55.131
It's for A. P. bio. We have to write a report
about a disease, and I got the worst one.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.100
- This is a joke.
- Actually, it's pretty serious.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.729
Back in college,
I caught mono from my roommate Ling.

00:59.794 --> 01:02.104
Served us right for fooling around.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.507
Never share a flute, kids.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.044
Can you drop me off at the library?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.512
Sorry. I'm meeting some friends
at that coffee shop on Lake.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.675
- You mean the one next to the library?
- That's a library?

01:11.739 --> 01:14.015
I thought it was a church
for a religion that didn't allow makeup.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.918
When is the washing machine
gonna get fixed?

01:15.976 --> 01:18.183
I'm wearing a swimsuit
underneath my pants.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.350
Everybody's gonna
have clean clothes soon.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.621
The repair guy's supposed to come today
between 10:00 and 2:00.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.185
Oh! Honey, can you be here for that?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.857
Can I sit around in an empty house
and wait for someone?

01:26.921 --> 01:29.367
Baby, I'm a Realtor.
I have a license for that.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.061
- You sure you don't mind?
- Go. Run your errands.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.731
- It'll give me a chance to get started on these dishes.
- Oh, good.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.296
All right. Come on, Luke.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.308
All right. See you guys later.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.676
Oh. More dishes than I thought.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.579
That lasagna's gonna be a tough one.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.448
Somebody's gonna need a scrub brush.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.312
Hello?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.414
What?

01:54.982 --> 01:57.087
No... way.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.529
June 10, 1988.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.967
Carla Concannon and I spent the afternoon
frolicking at the public pool.

02:04.024 --> 02:07.403
Later, at her house, things got private...

02:07.461 --> 02:11.307
while a 45 of Carly Simon's
"Nobody Does it Better" played.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.278
It was my first time, her first time...

02:15.136 --> 02:16.240
with me.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.045
I always thought
it'd be fun to own that 45.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.017
When the record store
finally called that morning..

02:21.075 --> 02:23.578
I ran right down
so I wouldn't miss the repairman.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.214
I had to have it.

02:25.279 --> 02:30.126
It was the chance to relive
those magical three minutes and 42 seconds...

02:30.184 --> 02:32.130
which was also the length of the song

02:32.186 --> 02:34.029
But then it dawned on me.

02:34.088 --> 02:38.366
I was cheating on my wife
with the red-hot memory of another woman.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.042
I could not let Claire find out.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.368
I had to destroy the evidence.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.278
Luckily, I'm cool under pressure.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.313
Ow!

02:55.876 --> 02:57.878
Ow.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.251
What? No!

03:02.316 --> 03:05.297
When did he- Come on!

03:05.352 --> 03:07.423
There were a couple of snags...

03:07.488 --> 03:10.162
but I think I covered my tracks
pretty well.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.836
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:13.894 --> 03:15.931
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:15.996 --> 03:18.033
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:18.098 --> 03:20.009
♪ Hey, hey♪

03:20.067 --> 03:21.239
♪ Hey,♪♪

03:24.505 --> 03:26.815
I'm so sorry it took so long
to get you these clothes.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.218
I left them in the back of my car
and completely forgot about 'em.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.778
Sounds familiar.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.346
I was in the pharmacy for three minutes.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.326
You had a cracked window and a juice box.
Let's retire that story.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.123
Can I wear this for the family photo?

03:37.184 --> 03:38.686
Oh, honey, that's adorable...

03:38.752 --> 03:42.131
but Gloria wants us in jeans and a black T-shirt,
classic and casual.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.793
Then maybe afterwards, we can stop by...

03:43.857 --> 03:45.530
and change the scenery
in a high school play.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.573
That is a really cute dress.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.369
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Just got it yesterday.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.411
Really? it reminds me of
something I gave you six months ago.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.639
Do you ever put her
in the girls' hand-me-downs?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.272
- Oh, yeah. All the time.
- Really?

03:56.337 --> 03:59.648
Because if my girls' old clothes
aren't to your taste...

03:59.707 --> 04:01.550
I could always just...
give 'em to somebody else.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.111
Okay, calm down, Claire.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.214
Your voice is getting to that pitch
that disturbs our cat.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.849
Hey. Oh, my God.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.725
You will not believe what Dad just said.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.286
- So, we're at the mall, right?
- Mm-hmm.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.299
And there's a piano there.
I sit down behind it.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.096
Come on, Mitchell.
He's just not wired for compliments.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.659
I'm sure your playing was great.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.639
I don't play the piano.
I've never taken a lesson.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.141
- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God. My own family doesn't even know me.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.700
Mitchell, please. Don't be so sensitive.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.268
You don't see me pitching a fit...

04:27.334 --> 04:30.440
because Cam is too much of a snob
to use our hand-me-downs.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.814
- Sn- I'm sorry. Snob?
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.854
I will have you know
I come from simple farm folk.

04:35.909 --> 04:39.755
There is permanent dirt underneath
these fingernails from working the soil.

04:39.813 --> 04:44.091
Really? I had no idea that repotting
your orchids counted as "working the soil."

04:44.151 --> 04:47.394
They're in soil- You know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.957
I don't need to listen to this.
I'm gonna go out and get some air.

04:50.024 --> 04:53.403
- I know the feeling.
- Retire it. Seriously.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.770
Does Joe look a little pale to you?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.605
This whole country looks pale to me.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.442
I think he needs a little color
for tonight's photograph.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.108
What do you think is the minimum age
for spray tanning?

05:04.171 --> 05:08.677
Now that Joe is here
and that his head is finally normal-shaped...

05:08.742 --> 05:11.279
I decided to take a new family portrait.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.957
- ¡Hola!
- How did it go at the mall?

05:15.015 --> 05:18.189
Bought a shirt, angered my son.
Another successful outing.

05:18.252 --> 05:20.198
Ooh. I've been wanting to do this.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.564
Quick. What's the ring
around an angel's head?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.398
- What?
- Halo!

05:24.458 --> 05:26.096
You did the angel one!

05:26.160 --> 05:29.073
Ordinarily, I'd be delighted,
but this isn't gonna be one of our fun chats.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.575
You mean like that time you called me
when you saw that blimp?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.475
It was so low they waved back.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.606
I'd done a pretty good job
eliminating all traces of that record...

05:36.670 --> 05:39.082
but there was still one loose end

05:50.851 --> 05:53.331
You know earlier today,
when we ran into each other on the street?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.832
I didn't see you. You didn't see me.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.596
Okay, so you're saying
whatever either one of us...

05:57.658 --> 05:59.604
might have been doing will remain forever-

05:59.660 --> 06:02.470
I didn't see you You didn't see me.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.941
Just to be c- Hello?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.808
Jay's so cool. He gets it.

06:07.868 --> 06:12.510
I didn't know what he was talking about,
but I needed him to keep his trap shut.

06:12.573 --> 06:16.919
You see, lately, I may have been
dabbling in something that...

06:16.977 --> 06:21.323
strong, virile men like me
aren't supposed to be dabbling in.

06:21.382 --> 06:26.058
And it wouldn't exactly fit my image if
people found out I was considering entering...

06:26.120 --> 06:28.464
a certain adorable dog...

06:28.522 --> 06:30.195
in a dog show.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.931
Gloria thought I was out
getting my tires rotated

06:32.993 --> 06:36.304
Actually, I was buying Stella
a decorative show collar.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.105
You know, just in case.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.340
I figure if she looks beautiful,
she'll feel beautiful.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.010
Guess who we ran into at the library.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.145
- How would I know? I was here the whole time.
- Sanjay Patel.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.120
- He's got Crohn's disease.
- No!

06:51.178 --> 06:53.522
I know. So lucky. He's totally
going to win that science scholarship.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.321
He should use it
to find a cure for baldness...

06:55.382 --> 06:57.225
'cause that kid is 16 with a comb-over.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.695
That's it!
I'm just gonna pick a new topic.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.325
I want a disease that everyone
in the school is going to talk about.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.460
All right!

07:06.059 --> 07:07.299
- Hey!
- Hi! Wow!

07:07.361 --> 07:08.897
- Why are you standing there?
- 'Cause I missed you.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.600
- I love you so much.
- Oh!

07:10.664 --> 07:12.905
- Mwah.
- Oh, wow. Love you too.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.639
How'd it go with the repair guy?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.772
"The repair guy came, but I missed him."

07:16.837 --> 07:18.339
"Why? What were you doing?"

07:18.405 --> 07:20.476
"Listening to a record." "What record?"

07:20.541 --> 07:22.350
"it's not important." "Phil!"

07:22.409 --> 07:25.879
"The soundtrack to my first sexual experience
that I think about from time to time.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.416
Honey, where are you going?
Don't take the kids!"

07:29.483 --> 07:32.521
- He didn't show up.
- What? That is so annoying.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.930
I know. Put away your groceries.
I'll call him and reschedule.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.764
No, no, no, no, no.
You are too nice. I am calling.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.499
- I am not resting till I get to the bottom of this.
- It's no big deal.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.667
- It's not the first time I've been stood up by some guy.
- Listen to your words, Phil.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.867
Yep. Yep.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.813
She called me a snob, Mitchell.

07:52.873 --> 07:58.755
Oh, I'm sorry if I don't rush to throw Lily
in every bargain-bin rag Claire tosses our way.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.224
You're not really shedding
the snob tag with that.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.228
Look, why don't we just put Lily
in one of Alex's shirts for the picture tonight?

08:04.284 --> 08:06.628
- She'll see right through that.
- No, you're thinking of Haley's shirts.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.930
No, I mean it'll look like we're doing it
just because she brought it up.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.334
Well, I know. That's why
I'm looking for a photo of Lily...

08:12.392 --> 08:15.236
in a hand-me-down to show Claire,
but I can't seem to find one.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.571
By the way, I'm barely in any of these.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.702
Mitchell, are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

08:19.766 --> 08:22.076
Yes! Sometimes I feel like
this family looks right past-

08:22.135 --> 08:24.513
You're suggesting that
we stage a photograph...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.073
put Lily in some hand-me-downs...

08:26.139 --> 08:28.483
make it look like it's from the past-
Christmas, say-

08:28.542 --> 08:30.044
just to prove Claire wrong?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.612
Simplicity itself.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.419
That's not remotely what I'm saying.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.120
Mitchell, don't second-guess yourself.
It's simplicity itself.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.023
Yes. Once again,
I would like to speak to a supervisor.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.002
Listen, if my husband
said nobody came, nobody came.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.732
- Dad, it's your move.
- No, I think I should just play it cool for now.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.442
I'm so sorry.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.671
Score! I got a disease
that's rare and fun- narcolepsy.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.977
The company swears that
the driver was here at 10:00.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.745
They're putting him through to me right now.
I'm gonna chip away at his story.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.513
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's see how you get out of this.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.748
- I'm thinking.
- It's a neurological condition...

09:03.810 --> 09:06.313
where people under extreme stress
actually fall asleep.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.018
It's like a way for the brain to escape.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.061
I bet he was doing
something he shouldn't have.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.688
I'm just gonna let him keep talking
till he makes a mistake.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.562
Everybody makes mistakes.

09:14.621 --> 09:17.602
- And the noose tightens.
- Why were my headphones in the couch?

09:17.658 --> 09:20.229
Oh, good. You do keep G. P.S. logs
on all your drivers.

09:20.294 --> 09:21.796
There's no way out.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.364
Let me just write down your name.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.434
Hey, does anybody need a receipt
from Flipside Records?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.774
Damn it! I didn't even see that!

09:29.836 --> 09:31.008
Wow.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.280
I see you're registered for tonight's show.
First one, huh?

09:35.342 --> 09:36.685
Yeah.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.518
I'm not sure I'm comfortable...

09:38.579 --> 09:41.560
with that whole prancing-in-a-circle thing
in front of everybody.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.390
Can someone else
run her through her routine?

09:43.450 --> 09:46.761
- It has to be the owner.
- I suppose that's the best. We have a rapport.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.322
All right. See you at 5:00.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.767
5:00. Uh, I got a family thing at 5:00.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.271
- Do these things tend to start on time?
- Of course.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.830
It's not a cat show.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.308
Well, I better speed it along. Come on.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.369
I can't believe
Mom made me take you here.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.314
- This is my only black shirt, and
Mom needs me to wash it. - Wow.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.146
It's only when I see the less fortunate...

10:06.206 --> 10:08.243
that I realize how lucky my clothes are.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.515
All the machines are taken.
We're gonna have to wait.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.558
Oh, I am not spending any more time
in fluorescent lighting than I have to.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.322
You're gonna sneak your shirt in
with someone else's load- like that guy's.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.919
Go that way. I'll distract him.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.257
Excuse me.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.062
- Haley?
- Oh, my God. Kevin.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.661
It's Keith. You really don't remember
the guy you abandoned at Coachella?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.832
I didn't abandon you.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.535
I-i texted you.
That deejay put me in a trance.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.442
Yeah. it's- it's almost like
you were using me for tickets.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.573
That's crazy.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.108
Can you get those again, or was that just,
like, a one-time thing with your uncle?

10:41.174 --> 10:43.051
It was a one-time thing.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.954
- Okay, so, good seeing you.
- Yeah.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.152
- Remind me never to date you.
- You wish.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.923
- Please. I could totally get you.
- Like to see you try.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.294
All right. Lily,
can you come in here, please?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.867
It's Christmas already? Yay!

10:57.924 --> 10:59.460
Ah. Probably should've prepped her.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.996
No, it's not actually Christmas.
We're just gonna take a fun photo.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.067
Which I am going to be in because I am
a member of the- Where is my stocking?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.135
Oh, relax. it's not in the shot.
Neither are you.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.681
Here. I want you to take the picture
from right over here. This way.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.978
Okay, great. Lily,
I want you to put this on...

11:13.040 --> 11:15.452
and stand in front of the tree,
and we'll pop a shot off.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.580
Ooh! Look at all the pretty presents!

11:17.644 --> 11:19.146
Those are just empty boxes.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.214
You're killing me.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.257
I don't know which one it is!
I didn't see him put it in!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.264
Wait. I think I found it.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.294
- He's coming!
- What? No!

11:30.357 --> 11:33.361
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I-I saw that your laundry was done...

11:33.427 --> 11:36.738
and I was gonna fold it for you
to make us even...

11:36.797 --> 11:38.936
for what you thought that I did
that I didn't do.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.310
Even? I held your popcorn for eight hours
waiting for you to come back.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.680
I walked all the parking areas twice,
checked every medical tent.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.619
By the time I got back to my car, it had
been broken into and the battery was gone.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.486
I had to trade my festival pass
for a ride home in a horse trailer.

11:52.546 --> 11:57.928
But looks like
someone got a concert T-shirt.

11:57.984 --> 12:01.363
Dad, is there anything bothering you
that might be causing...

12:01.421 --> 12:03.662
I don't know, major psychological stress?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.829
No. I've been acting normally,
haven't I?

12:05.892 --> 12:09.135
- Did something happen earlier today?
- Uh, nothing at all.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.506
- Because you seem a little tense.
- What? No, I don't!

12:11.565 --> 12:13.636
Stop badgering me! I love your mom!
Let's listen to some music.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.442
- ♪ Nobody, does it better♪
- Boy, the way you cook things up sometimes-

12:16.503 --> 12:18.005
- Dad!
- What?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.347
You fell asleep.
It's like the fifth time today.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.411
I think it has something to do with that guy
not showing up to fix the washing machine.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.286
Well, that's not exactly what happened.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.349
You snuck out to buy "Nobody Does it Better"
from Flipside Records, and he showed up?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.123
That's more exactly what happened.
How do you know all this?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.891
I've been watching you all day.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.126
I think the guilt from that
has been causing you to fall asleep.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.498
- So you know about Carla?
- I do now.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.069
- Dad!
- What is happening?

12:44.831 --> 12:47.869
I was skeptical about
the jeans and T-shirt, but I like it.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.346
Any chance the photographer
could fire off a couple solo shots?

12:50.403 --> 12:53.543
Look at the bottom of Joe's face.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.143
What happened?
Did you leave him in the sun?

12:55.208 --> 12:58.678
No, I took him out for five minutes
to give him a little color.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.487
I must have not closed the visor
all the way down.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.028
Why is it so important to you
that he has color?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.291
Because we're sending this picture
to our family in Colombia...

13:06.353 --> 13:09.027
and I have a son
that doesn't even look Colombian.

13:09.089 --> 13:12.901
Now they're gonna look at this picture, and they're
gonna think that I am a terrible mother...

13:12.959 --> 13:15.405
that I can't even
take care of my own child.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.102
I think your reputation is set.
I can still do this with my arm...

13:18.165 --> 13:19.872
'cause I slept in a sink till I was three.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.276
Halo!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.245
- People are here. I'll deal with Joe.
- Okay.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.080
Come on, buddy. Oh. Come on.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.983
Hola. Claire is on her way.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.680
Dad, you have to confess to Mom.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.281
- Clearing your conscience is the
only way to make this stop. - Really?

13:33.346 --> 13:36.020
I hope so, or else I have to rewrite
the whole end of my paper.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.028
Just the two of you? Where's the rest?

13:38.084 --> 13:40.564
I had hoped to get this picture thing
wrapped up by 5:00.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.600
- They're all coming separately.
- Cam, do me a favor.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.294
Call Mitchell and light a fire under him.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.236
- I'm right here, Dad.
- Oh. Good. I didn't see you come in.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.605
You opened the door for me. You thanked me
for bringing a bottle of Chardonnay.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.473
Doesn't sound like me.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.307
- Hey, guys. We're here.
- Finally!

13:54.367 --> 13:56.244
Let's do this.
Luke, where's your black shirt?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.874
- Right here. I'll get changed.
- All right. Shake a leg.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.748
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi!

14:00.807 --> 14:02.309
- Hey.
- Hello.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.254
Hey, Lily, be careful.
Don't get anything on that beautiful outfit.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.019
Recognize it? Look familiar?

14:07.080 --> 14:10.289
Yes, I do, but I hardly think that putting her
in one of Alex's hand-me-downs...

14:10.350 --> 14:12.057
proves anything after I pitched a fit.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.565
First of all, I think it's really healthy
that you do admit it was a fit.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.933
But if you need further proof,
I'm sure I could find a photograph over here.

14:18.992 --> 14:19.993
Sure. Go ahead.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.234
- Mm-hmm.
- No me. No me. No me.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.037
Ah. There we are.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.510
- Christmas morning last year.
- Oh, my God.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.411
Oh, it's Alex's old pajamas!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.347
I'm so sorry. I owe you an apology.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.907
Sometimes I can be really-

14:33.974 --> 14:35.476
What's that?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.453
Uh, the calendar open to December...

14:37.510 --> 14:40.423
the half-eaten cookies for Santa Claus,
the nibbled-on carrots for reindeer?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.982
I don't know.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.257
No, that looks like
last month's VanityFair.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.264
Oh, well, you know,
every month's "Young Hollywood."

14:47.320 --> 14:49.766
Mmm, and didn't Lily just lose that tooth?

14:49.823 --> 14:52.429
It's still there. it's just dirty.
Christmas morning chocolates.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.802
Uh, and I am quite sure
that's a reflection of Mitchell...

14:54.861 --> 14:57.000
in the clothes
he was wearing this morning.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.838
Oh, yay, I finally made it into a picture.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.345
- Just couldn't change, could you?
- You are a snob.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.039
Okay, you know what?
It hardly takes a snob...

15:03.103 --> 15:05.982
to recognize the clothes you put
your children in are uninspired at best.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.542
- Claire, Cam, enough.
- Oh, really?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.246
Everybody in this family has good taste.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.189
It's just different.
It's causing too many fights.

15:13.246 --> 15:17.888
That's why today I just put everybody
in a simple T-shirt and jeans outfit.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.956
There's a new rule from now on. Nobody
gives clothes to anyone else's children.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.127
- Well, I think that's probably for the best.
- Okay.

15:24.190 --> 15:29.731
Thank God I don't have to spend one more of
Joe's birthdays with a funny smile on my face.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.901
Thank you, Cam. He loves it.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.967
Twinsies!

15:34.935 --> 15:36.812
Yay!

15:36.870 --> 15:38.907
Okay, everybody, it's picture time.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.747
- Where's Luke?
- Right here.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.980
Honey, what are you wearing?
Is that a girl's shirt?

15:43.043 --> 15:45.250
I guess I grabbed the wrong one
from the Laundromat.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.553
If I'm being honest,
I don't hate the way it fits.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.561
It must be that guy's girlfriend's shirt.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.894
- Is it bad that that makes him more interesting to me?
- Yes. Stay away.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.831
Don't worry about Luke.
We'll stick him in the back row.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.028
Not everyone can look their best
in the picture.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.537
Joe's ready.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.574
- What did you do to him?
- You want him to look more Colombian.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.735
What's more Colombian
than the Colombian flag?

16:05.799 --> 16:06.971
He's perfect.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.569
Not a banner day for my male heirs.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.412
Claire, you're in the back.
Phil, you're behind Claire.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.351
No rabbit ears. I don't want you
messing around behind Claire's back.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.447
- Dad.
- Cameron, Lily!

16:17.510 --> 16:19.012
Come on in. it's picture time.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.581
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.183
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Mmm.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.422
Um, you know how you can treasure
special moments in your past...

16:25.485 --> 16:27.863
that in no way diminish
the special moments in your present?

16:27.921 --> 16:29.628
Yeah, sweetheart.
It's called having a memory.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.862
Okay, I wouldn't mind a friendlier tone
as I move through this.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.632
- What did you do?
- Up, up, up, up, ah!

16:33.693 --> 16:35.195
No, that's the wrong way, sweetheart.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.104
What fell out of Lily's pocket?

16:37.163 --> 16:41.236
- Is that a diamond ring?
- Ha. That'll go great with your shirt.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.339
- It looks real.
- It is real.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.375
A small occlusion,
but very good color. This is Claire's.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.478
- No. Claire's got hers on.
- Yeah.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.352
Ay. Phil, please.
You cannot tell the difference...

16:52.412 --> 16:55.825
between this beautiful
but small diamond...

16:55.882 --> 17:00.297
and that chunk of glass that should have
made her finger fall off weeks ago?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.330
I feel like I am getting you in trouble.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.565
- Picture time!
- What's happening?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.664
Okay, don't be mad. Um-

17:10.663 --> 17:12.300
I lost my real ring a few months ago...

17:12.365 --> 17:15.608
and I just realized it must have fallen
in the box of clothes I gave to Lily.

17:15.667 --> 17:19.480
- Why'd you take it off?
- Well, I got pulled over...

17:19.539 --> 17:23.782
and I wanted to flirt my way out of the ticket
by pretending I was single...

17:23.843 --> 17:26.414
and it worked, and I-I kind of liked it.

17:26.479 --> 17:30.621
And then I felt so guilty about liking it
that I just wanted to erase the whole thing.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.755
- So you lied?
- Yes. I lied. I'm sorry.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.824
- Does that make me a terrible person?
- No, no.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.995
- Are you kidding me?
- No?

17:39.059 --> 17:42.802
We've been married for a long time.
Of course we're gonna have our little secrets.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.705
- The important thing-
- Mm-hmm?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.040
Is that we know the difference
between a harmless indulgence-

17:47.100 --> 17:49.410
- Mm-hmm.
- and a real indescre-

17:50.970 --> 17:51.971
Gloria?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.441
- Left.
- Thank you.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.215
Okay, it's picture time!
Everybody, hurry up.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.951
Get in your positions. All right?

18:00.013 --> 18:02.015
All right, I think that everyone is here.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.086
Okay, ready? And smile!

18:05.151 --> 18:06.653
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.393
Nobody noticed I wasn't here.
What does it take with you people?

18:09.456 --> 18:12.835
Ay. Joe, my baby, are you okay?

18:12.892 --> 18:15.736
Yeah, yeah, maybe that's
what it takes for you to pay attention to me.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.934
Throw a temper tantrum like Joe.
I could just...

18:17.997 --> 18:20.136
throw a big... temper tantrum that-

18:20.200 --> 18:22.339
Or make a mess of everything and-

18:32.645 --> 18:36.388
I feel like that was aimed at me.
You want to talk about it?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.191
- Or I could just play some piano.
- So I'm in the ballpark.

18:40.920 --> 18:46.461
Look. if it seems sometimes
like we don't notice you...

18:46.526 --> 18:51.305
maybe that is because we are focused
on our own stupid problems...

18:51.364 --> 18:53.640
- and you're so steady.
- Oh, you mean boring.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.838
- No.
- Yeah.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.312
Calm.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.406
Because you live your life
the way you want to.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.887
In fact, you inspired me recently.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.216
- How so?
- Well-

19:06.279 --> 19:09.453
Fine.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.086
I've been going through this thing lately.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.099
It all started when I noticed
a group of guys in the corner in the park.

19:15.155 --> 19:19.228
And, uh, honestly, when I first found out what
they were doing, I thought it was kind of weird...

19:19.292 --> 19:21.602
but I found I kept thinking about it.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.064
And I thought I'd give it a whirl.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.632
O-Okay. Go on.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.144
I think you know where
I'm going with this, but-

19:28.201 --> 19:30.010
One of the older guys showed me the ropes.

19:30.069 --> 19:34.779
Next thing I know, I'm hanging out at that park
in that corner every day and loving it.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.479
Uh-huh.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.750
But I must have also
got some shame about it...

19:38.811 --> 19:41.485
because it feels good
when I'm doing it, but-

19:41.548 --> 19:43.050
Is that me now?

19:43.116 --> 19:45.096
A guy with a show dog?

19:45.151 --> 19:48.894
There it is! Okay, see, I-I knew what
it wasn't. I just wasn't sure what it was.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.493
In fact, there's a show right now, but-
Ah, I'm not gonna go.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.197
No, no.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.672
D- I could tell this is important to you.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.231
- No.
- You should go. You should go.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.108
I don't want to sneak out,
and I don't want people to know about it.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.976
Dad.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.916
A wise man once told me, "I don't get it...

20:06.973 --> 20:10.785
but if that's who you are,
don't you dare be ashamed of it."

20:14.147 --> 20:15.649
I did handle that kind of well.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.696
- Yeah, yeah, well.
- And it wasn't easy.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.664
I just never pictured my kid a lawyer.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.196
It's scary to let people see the real you..

20:26.259 --> 20:28.762
Even when those people
are your own family

20:28.828 --> 20:32.332
But aren't they the ones we should be least worried about?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.537
The ones who will love us without judging..

20:34.601 --> 20:37.013
Who forgive our faults
and celebrate our imperfections...

20:37.070 --> 20:40.142
maybe even encourage us
to let our true selves shine through.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.345
Wait, wait.
Hang on. Wait, wait.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.889
Okay.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.022
- I think you look beautiful.
- I look old.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.064
All my cousins are going to see this.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.895
Click the button
that makes my wrinkles go away.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.566
- What happened?
- Nothing.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.404
It's not nothing. You're limping!

21:04.464 --> 21:06.808
Were you trying to do
the Russian dance again?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.607
It was just something stupid
I was trying out...

21:08.668 --> 21:11.308
and I don't even know why,
since it's basically impossible.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.873
Gloria. Gloria!

21:12.939 --> 21:15.920
Check it out. Is this not
the cutest thing you've ever seen?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.648
She did that on her first try.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.157
- He loves it too.
- Oh, sure. Rub it in, Joe.

21:21.214 --> 21:24.024
Attagirl!
Here she comes this way.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.563
- Now she's just showing off.
- Both ways.
