01:29.627 --> 01:33.431
The 1960s, American society is brought

01:33.498 --> 01:35.166
to the verge of revolution,

01:35.233 --> 01:37.802
and in the midst of this social turmoil

01:37.868 --> 01:39.470
is Sidney Muntzinger.

01:39.537 --> 01:42.207
Just, you got to trim a little
and take a little off the top.

01:42.273 --> 01:43.850
You know, right here would be very good.

01:43.874 --> 01:45.943
There's not too much on
the top to begin with.

01:46.010 --> 01:47.578
Yeah, no, I know, but you know,

01:47.645 --> 01:51.249
here, I tore a picture
out of a magazine,

01:51.316 --> 01:53.651
and I thought, you know,
if you could do this,

01:53.718 --> 01:55.720
just shape it like that.

01:55.786 --> 01:57.121
That's James Dean.

01:57.122 --> 01:59.124
Yeah, and if you could do that,

01:59.190 --> 02:00.801
you know, I'd like
that kind of cut there.

02:00.825 --> 02:02.460
I can't make you look like James Dean.

02:02.527 --> 02:05.129
No, I know, I don't
expect that, obviously,

02:05.130 --> 02:07.598
but, you know, come as close as you can.

02:07.665 --> 02:09.567
I can work on your hair
for ten years Sidney,

02:09.633 --> 02:11.112
you're never gonna look like James Dean.

02:11.136 --> 02:12.803
I understand Dominic, I get it,

02:12.870 --> 02:15.306
but you know, give it your
best shot, is all I'm asking.

02:15.373 --> 02:17.308
Okay, all right, all right.

02:19.884 --> 02:22.487
So I finished your last novel.

02:22.553 --> 02:24.289
Mm-hmm, okay.

02:24.355 --> 02:26.857
Finally, took all winter.

02:26.992 --> 02:29.160
Why? It was just a novella.

02:29.227 --> 02:30.895
It was not even 200 pages.

02:30.996 --> 02:33.364
Well, I kept dozing off.

02:33.431 --> 02:37.568
Well, you know, you
know, you get up early,

02:37.635 --> 02:38.569
so those hours...

02:38.636 --> 02:40.147
I thought I might have a sleep disorder,

02:40.171 --> 02:41.339
like narcolepsy, you know?

02:41.406 --> 02:43.341
But my doctor said it was the book.

02:43.408 --> 02:45.310
See when I read in
bed, my eyes get tired

02:45.376 --> 02:47.588
unless I'm really gripped, or
at least somewhat interested.

02:47.612 --> 02:50.548
I really... Don't trim the ears.

02:50.615 --> 02:54.185
Leave my ears full, same
size as when I came in.

02:54.252 --> 02:56.030
At least if I care about
the characters, you know,

02:56.054 --> 02:57.555
even one of them.

02:57.622 --> 03:01.626
Well, you know, literature
is a very personal taste.

03:01.692 --> 03:03.528
I wouldn't exactly call it literature,

03:03.594 --> 03:05.396
although I liked it
better than your last one.

03:05.463 --> 03:06.397
Mm-hmm.

03:06.464 --> 03:08.199
This one was at least coherent.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.835
My last one was postmodern, so...

03:10.901 --> 03:12.637
Yeah, it was totally
incoherent, totally.

03:12.703 --> 03:14.805
I wouldn't exactly call
it incoherent, Dominic.

03:14.872 --> 03:16.017
Oh, come on, it was like the ravings

03:16.041 --> 03:17.608
of a madman, a lunatic,

03:17.675 --> 03:19.844
or let's say a guy with
limited intelligence.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.146
Uh, yes, well...

03:21.212 --> 03:23.047
I saw a lot of you in that character.

03:23.048 --> 03:25.316
Yeah, can you just cut the hair?

03:25.383 --> 03:26.584
So you're writing another?

03:26.651 --> 03:28.586
Or did I read your
publisher went bankrupt?

03:28.653 --> 03:32.056
Um, I'm working on an idea
for a television series now.

03:32.057 --> 03:34.959
Ah, probably an easier medium for you.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.228
But don't make the TV show incoherent.

03:37.295 --> 03:39.464
No, I'm gonna do my
best to keep it rational.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.366
- So, you know...
- What's it about?

03:41.432 --> 03:43.334
It's a family thing, you know.

03:43.401 --> 03:45.503
Oh, I see, the usual
dysfunctional family

03:45.570 --> 03:47.138
with the wise-cracking wife and kids

03:47.205 --> 03:50.975
and much-harassed
husband kind of thing?

03:51.076 --> 03:52.310
- Uh...
- Yeah? Yeah.

03:52.377 --> 03:53.678
Good idea. You know what?

03:53.744 --> 03:56.081
Stick with what works for other people.

03:56.114 --> 03:57.948
Let 'em say cliché, what do you care?

03:58.083 --> 03:59.693
You'll be humiliated
all the way to the bank.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.352
I didn't say cliché. It was...

04:01.419 --> 04:02.696
Look, there's no stigma, you know?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.889
Just because a TV series
is considered lowbrow

04:04.955 --> 04:06.424
compared to a book, come on.

04:06.491 --> 04:08.626
Yeah, well, it's, you
know, very lucrative,

04:08.693 --> 04:11.929
and, uh, there's not a lot
of money in novels, so...

04:11.996 --> 04:16.101
No, not unless you're
Salinger, which you're not.

04:16.134 --> 04:17.468
Your wife still work?

04:17.535 --> 04:19.670
Oh, yeah, she sees
people up at the house,

04:19.737 --> 04:22.740
but limited, you know,
not as much anymore.

04:22.807 --> 04:25.276
How do you decide if
someone's marriage goes bad,

04:25.343 --> 04:27.612
between a marriage
counselor and a shrink?

04:27.678 --> 04:29.314
Well, they're very different, you know.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.624
Kay, Kay is a marriage counselor.

04:30.648 --> 04:33.618
A shrink is a completely
different thing.

04:33.684 --> 04:35.296
I love the picture you
showed me of your house,

04:35.320 --> 04:37.655
by the way. It was really beautiful.

04:37.722 --> 04:40.458
I'm a very lucky guy, you
know, when I think of it,

04:40.525 --> 04:43.127
I got a lovely wife.
I got a great marriage.

04:43.128 --> 04:46.197
I got great grandchildren.
I, you know...

04:46.264 --> 04:48.233
I just live... I don't know.

04:48.299 --> 04:50.168
I'm blessed. I'm blessed.

04:50.235 --> 04:52.537
Yeah, so was Job. Then one, two, three,

04:52.603 --> 04:53.838
God fucked him over.

04:57.642 --> 05:01.011
So tell me, Mr. and Mrs. Bellman,

05:01.146 --> 05:03.148
exactly what marital difficulties

05:03.214 --> 05:04.615
bring you here today?

05:04.682 --> 05:05.883
We argue.

05:05.950 --> 05:07.885
We don't argue about material things.

05:07.952 --> 05:10.188
For instance, he wants
to live in the city;

05:10.255 --> 05:12.157
I want to live in the country.

05:12.223 --> 05:15.860
He doesn't want me to
work; I want to work.

05:15.926 --> 05:17.962
I love sports; she hates sports.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.231
I love movies; she hates movies.

05:20.298 --> 05:24.202
I love restaurants; she
likes to eat at home.

05:24.269 --> 05:25.503
He hates my cooking.

05:25.570 --> 05:27.605
I can't stand his snoring.

05:27.672 --> 05:30.575
I can't stand his terrible jokes.

05:30.641 --> 05:32.177
I hate her laugh.

05:32.243 --> 05:36.647
I hate that she loves to
shop and runs up the bills.

05:36.714 --> 05:39.617
I can't stand that he's
frugal, a cheapskate,

05:39.684 --> 05:44.222
and yet an embarrassing
over-tipper, plays the big shot.

05:44.289 --> 05:46.224
She sleeps with the window open.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.658
I need air-conditioning.

05:47.725 --> 05:50.728
He refuses to travel. He isn't romantic.

05:50.795 --> 05:53.664
He doesn't remember my
birthday or anniversary.

05:53.731 --> 05:56.267
She doesn't find me sexually appealing.

05:56.334 --> 05:59.570
Uh, he can't stand my family.

05:59.637 --> 06:03.207
She hates classical
music and must have a dog,

06:03.208 --> 06:05.476
and I hate dogs.

06:06.877 --> 06:11.516
So, um, are there any
things that you agree on?

06:13.884 --> 06:16.754
Neither one of us likes guacamole.

06:16.821 --> 06:19.390
Okay, that's a beginning.

06:19.457 --> 06:21.659
I mean, it's really
obvious that the two of you

06:21.726 --> 06:26.697
love each other, and I think
we can build on guacamole.

06:43.298 --> 06:45.100
Kay?

06:46.953 --> 06:47.953
I'm home.

06:47.988 --> 06:50.190
Uh, in the office.

06:50.256 --> 06:52.058
How do you like my haircut?

06:52.125 --> 06:53.293
Oh, you got a haircut?

06:53.394 --> 06:54.628
Yeah, you can't tell?

06:54.695 --> 06:56.396
Who do I look like?

06:56.397 --> 06:57.598
What do you mean?

06:57.664 --> 07:00.033
What actor do I look like?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.668
- What actor do you look like?
- Mm-hmm.

07:01.735 --> 07:05.406
Um, let me think for a minute.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.475
Franklin Pangborn.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.744
- Who?
- Franklin Pangborn.

07:10.811 --> 07:12.546
Who is Franklin Pangborn?

07:12.613 --> 07:15.148
He seems sort of a mincing,
effeminate little actor

07:15.215 --> 07:17.951
who plays a floor walker in
movies, and he's just great.

07:18.018 --> 07:20.654
He really is. He has only minor roles.

07:20.721 --> 07:22.456
But he has a silly mustache,

07:22.523 --> 07:24.434
W. C. Fields makes fun of
him in a lot of movies.

07:24.458 --> 07:25.892
That's not what I had in mind, Kay.

07:25.959 --> 07:29.062
Look, look more closely.

07:29.129 --> 07:30.497
Elisha Cook Jr.?

07:30.564 --> 07:32.132
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

07:32.198 --> 07:35.669
What's new? Anything happen today or...

07:35.736 --> 07:38.772
Uh, there was a massacre
of civilians in Vietnam.

07:39.906 --> 07:43.309
There was a riot in
a college in Michigan.

07:43.444 --> 07:45.345
And in San Francisco,
there was a bombing

07:45.446 --> 07:46.956
and a jailbreak by
the Black Liberation...

07:46.980 --> 07:49.082
Yeah, but did anything
happen at home, any good news,

07:49.149 --> 07:50.450
anything interesting, or...

07:50.451 --> 07:51.828
Yes, they fixed the television set.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.186
Oh, great.

07:53.253 --> 07:54.797
So right in time for the
baseball season, terrific.

07:54.821 --> 07:57.290
Yes, baseball all day long today.

07:58.492 --> 07:59.793
- Oh, the girls.
- Who's that?

07:59.860 --> 08:01.094
The girls, the girls are here.

08:01.161 --> 08:05.165
Oh, God, not that silly book club.

08:05.231 --> 08:06.467
Oh, it takes only an hour,

08:06.533 --> 08:08.201
and Jane and Doug are coming over

08:08.268 --> 08:10.471
and they're gonna bring
steaks, and you can grill

08:10.504 --> 08:12.873
on your new barbecue and work it out.

08:12.939 --> 08:16.743
Hello, hi. Come on in!

08:16.810 --> 08:17.810
Hi.

08:20.246 --> 08:21.381
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:24.818 --> 08:27.488
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Hi, sweetie.

08:27.521 --> 08:28.689
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

08:28.755 --> 08:29.956
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:30.023 --> 08:31.491
- So...
- Yeah.

08:31.492 --> 08:33.559
He wakes up one morning,

08:33.626 --> 08:36.897
and he's turned into a giant cockroach.

08:37.764 --> 08:39.732
I hate science fiction!

08:39.799 --> 08:42.669
It's not science fiction.
It's supposed to be symbolic.

08:42.736 --> 08:45.105
Right? Or am I reading this wrong?

08:45.171 --> 08:49.409
No, but the author has already
left me behind, I mean...

08:49.510 --> 08:51.077
What does the insect symbolize?

08:51.144 --> 08:55.782
The insect obviously
suffers from low self-esteem.

08:55.849 --> 08:56.783
From guilt.

08:56.850 --> 08:59.185
Could it be from original sin?

09:00.721 --> 09:04.591
Um, have we ever
considered the relationship

09:04.658 --> 09:06.326
of Kafka to his father?

09:06.392 --> 09:10.163
Is he the one who kills his
father and marries his mother?

09:10.230 --> 09:14.000
God, listen to her. That's Hercules.

09:14.067 --> 09:17.270
Oh, Jesus, this is a
state-of-the-art machine,

09:17.337 --> 09:20.373
and I can't work it. It won't work.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.142
Here, here, look at these steaks.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.977
We got 'em shipped in from Nebraska.

09:24.044 --> 09:25.555
You know, I think
we're gonna get a storm.

09:25.579 --> 09:27.089
Let's go in and make 'em in the stove.

09:27.113 --> 09:30.450
Oh, God, why can every
mental defective barbecue,

09:30.551 --> 09:33.086
and I can't get the barbecue to go?

09:33.153 --> 09:35.088
I didn't even think you ate steak.

09:35.155 --> 09:37.891
Yeah, I read an article
in a magazine that said

09:37.958 --> 09:39.660
you can add years to your life

09:39.726 --> 09:41.962
if you avoid anything pleasurable.

09:42.028 --> 09:45.198
Jesus, I can't get this thing to work,

09:45.265 --> 09:48.068
It just... no matter what
I do, it doesn't work.

09:48.134 --> 09:52.372
S. J. Muntzinger, he's a
brilliant author, brilliant,

09:52.438 --> 09:54.407
but he can't change a fuse.

09:54.474 --> 09:56.176
Is it true that you began as a writer

09:56.242 --> 09:57.778
for an advertising agency?

09:57.844 --> 09:59.445
He wrote the commercials

09:59.580 --> 10:01.948
for Stillman's Orthopedic Ice Cream.

10:02.015 --> 10:04.951
Yeah, they were trying
to play down the sugar

10:05.018 --> 10:07.954
and fat content, so I
came up with the idea

10:08.021 --> 10:10.423
that if they called it
Orthopedic Ice Cream,

10:10.490 --> 10:11.958
it'd be a big seller.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.927
- I remember those!
- Yeah!

10:13.994 --> 10:16.697
Oh, for starters Allen
and Ellie are gonna be

10:16.763 --> 10:18.865
having dinner with us tonight.

10:18.932 --> 10:20.033
Who?

10:20.100 --> 10:20.834
Allen, the boy

10:20.901 --> 10:22.402
who's staying with us.

10:22.468 --> 10:23.637
Oh him, oh, well,

10:23.704 --> 10:25.138
I wouldn't call him a boy.

10:25.205 --> 10:27.540
He's kind of a boy. I mean, he's young,

10:27.608 --> 10:30.076
and his parents are very
good friends of ours,

10:30.143 --> 10:32.579
and he's taking his
master's in business.

10:32.646 --> 10:35.248
So, uh, they're very conservative,

10:35.315 --> 10:38.318
and NYU is way down
in Greenwich Village,

10:38.384 --> 10:40.086
and they're afraid...
they don't want him

10:40.153 --> 10:42.789
to meet any hippies or druggies, so...

10:42.856 --> 10:44.991
Yeah, he's a very straight kid.

10:45.058 --> 10:47.994
And they're coming down in
about a month to meet Ellie,

10:48.061 --> 10:52.532
who... his fiancée, and she's
a lovely girl, lovely girl.

10:52.599 --> 10:55.636
Hey, tell 'em who
introduced the two of 'em.

10:55.702 --> 10:58.639
S. J. Muntzinger introduced them.

10:58.705 --> 11:00.473
Yeah, I was downtown at art gallery

11:00.641 --> 11:02.084
and there's this pretty blonde there,

11:02.108 --> 11:05.145
and I'm talking to her,
and she's educated and rich.

11:05.211 --> 11:07.648
You know, I figured
this is it for Allen.

11:07.714 --> 11:10.250
She's a debutante. She came out.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.028
That's all the parents
had to hear, you know?

11:12.052 --> 11:14.721
They think that he's
marrying Grace Kelly.

11:14.788 --> 11:15.922
Oh, that's so great.

11:15.989 --> 11:17.190
So they fell in love?

11:17.257 --> 11:18.558
Yeah, completely.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.139
Oh, I bet they'll have a big wedding.

11:20.193 --> 11:23.063
Oh it's so romantic when
your kids fall in love.

11:23.129 --> 11:25.031
You miss the kids not being home?

11:25.098 --> 11:27.400
Oh, you should see our grandson.

11:27.467 --> 11:31.171
He looks like Robert
Redford, and he's brilliant.

11:31.237 --> 11:33.039
Robert Redford.

11:33.106 --> 11:35.008
You know who you look
like with that haircut?

11:35.075 --> 11:36.677
- I just realized.
- Who's that?

11:36.710 --> 11:38.945
You know the actor Percy Helton?

11:39.012 --> 11:40.046
Who?

11:40.113 --> 11:41.581
Percy Helton.

11:41.682 --> 11:43.116
Percy Helton, I see it.

11:43.183 --> 11:44.751
- Right?
- Yeah, it's perfect!

11:44.818 --> 11:47.220
You know, he always
played a kind of cringing,

11:47.287 --> 11:48.454
squeaky-voiced little loser.

11:49.522 --> 11:50.824
Let's go inside.

11:50.891 --> 11:52.392
We'll cook the steaks inside,

11:52.458 --> 11:54.527
'cause there's gonna be an
electrical storm tonight,

11:54.594 --> 11:57.764
and this is not gonna ever
work, and it's a catastrophe.

11:57.831 --> 11:59.275
Oh, yes, there was
turbulence in the stars.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.267
You know, I did all of
our horoscopes today,

12:01.334 --> 12:03.294
and it said that you and
Kay were in for some kind

12:03.336 --> 12:04.705
of a shocking experience.

12:04.738 --> 12:06.172
Oh, well.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.074
So your parents haven't met hers yet?

12:08.141 --> 12:09.986
Well, actually they've spoken
to each other on the phone,

12:10.010 --> 12:11.577
and they hit it off well.

12:11.712 --> 12:13.346
Oh, a wedding at The Plaza,

12:13.413 --> 12:14.981
it sounds so elegant.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.752
What was the hotel that we
got married in, in New Orleans?

12:18.819 --> 12:20.286
The Scorpion.

12:20.353 --> 12:21.287
The Scorpion.

12:21.354 --> 12:23.456
Where will you honeymoon?

12:23.523 --> 12:25.525
- Um, Europe?
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.591 --> 12:26.960
Rome, Athens.

12:27.027 --> 12:29.796
Oh, Doug and I are going
on a cruise this fall.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.307
Yeah, we're going to the Greek islands.

12:31.331 --> 12:34.034
I know it's silly to
ask if you want to come.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.570
Well, um, Sid on a cruise...

12:37.637 --> 12:39.339
Is the cruise on a boat?

12:39.405 --> 12:40.774
Definitely.

12:40.841 --> 12:42.608
- On water too.
- It's a big boat.

12:42.743 --> 12:43.977
I'm sure, and it doesn't rock,

12:44.044 --> 12:46.146
except as soon as you
get on it, it rocks.

12:46.212 --> 12:49.049
Um, let me say two words to
you, if you're going on a cruise,

12:49.115 --> 12:53.153
food poisoning, okay, inevitable.

12:53.219 --> 12:55.756
And then you're out in
the middle of the Atlantic,

12:55.789 --> 12:58.158
it's 12 midnight, your appendix bursts.

12:58.224 --> 12:59.893
Well, they have helicopters.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.762
They can take you right to a hospital.

13:01.828 --> 13:04.597
You gonna go on a helicopter,
with the little pin that

13:04.664 --> 13:07.834
holds the blades, the little
tiny pin holds those blades?

13:07.901 --> 13:11.972
And you want to be
operated on in a hospital

13:12.038 --> 13:13.573
in some foreign...

13:13.639 --> 13:16.609
You want open-heart
surgery in the Cameroons?

13:18.211 --> 13:20.947
Sid doesn't like to
be any where but home

13:21.014 --> 13:24.550
and in his own little spot
on the bed with a ball game

13:24.617 --> 13:25.886
playing on the television,

13:25.952 --> 13:28.955
and he likes his
routine to be unruffled.

13:29.022 --> 13:31.324
You know, I got to say I agree with him.

13:31.391 --> 13:34.094
So what are you gonna do
after you get your master's?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.496
Allen's going to go into
his father's business.

13:36.562 --> 13:37.797
Oh, what's that?

13:37.798 --> 13:39.966
Um, money management.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.968
Oh, maybe I should talk to your father.

13:42.035 --> 13:44.304
No, his father doesn't handle any client

13:44.370 --> 13:46.139
that doesn't have a million dollars.

13:46.206 --> 13:47.874
- A million dollars?
- Yeah.

13:47.941 --> 13:50.110
That's all right. I've
got, uh, let me see.

13:50.176 --> 13:53.880
It's like, you know, $50, $54, $54.

13:53.947 --> 13:55.491
You guys have to...
You got to excuse us.

13:55.515 --> 13:57.217
- We, uh, should get going.
- Oh no!

13:57.283 --> 14:00.153
We're going to see some
great folk music downtown.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.555
- Oh, folk music, wow.
- Yeah.

14:02.622 --> 14:04.024
- Yes.
- Well, you're excused!

14:04.090 --> 14:05.334
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

14:05.358 --> 14:06.969
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

14:06.993 --> 14:08.170
- Lovely to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

14:08.194 --> 14:09.395
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

14:09.462 --> 14:10.831
There's dessert, right?

14:10.864 --> 14:12.966
Well, so shall we go to
the den and have coffee?

14:14.700 --> 14:16.069
They make such a nice couple.

14:16.136 --> 14:18.371
I know. Ha, to be young again.

14:18.438 --> 14:20.640
Not me, I would not like to be young

14:20.706 --> 14:22.408
and get shipped off to Vietnam.

14:22.475 --> 14:23.509
The news, the news.

14:23.576 --> 14:25.111
Oh, no, don't depress me.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.747
Oh, boy, did you ever think
you'd see America like this?

14:27.848 --> 14:30.716
So polarized, you know, these riots,

14:30.851 --> 14:32.318
uh, black versus white,

14:32.385 --> 14:35.221
uh, male versus female,
young versus old?

14:35.288 --> 14:36.856
These strikes will continue

14:36.857 --> 14:38.458
until the Vietnam War ends,

14:38.524 --> 14:40.626
and there is no end
to this war in sight.

14:40.693 --> 14:42.195
I hate this stupid war.

14:42.262 --> 14:44.764
Oh, I know. You know, our
friends' kids wanted us

14:44.865 --> 14:46.665
to go and demonstrate
in Washington last week,

14:46.699 --> 14:49.235
but I don't know. I think
I'm too old for that.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.736
Well, I would have gone, but Sid...

14:50.871 --> 14:52.038
Yeah, yeah, forget it!

14:52.105 --> 14:54.908
You know, I'm allergic to tear gas.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.742
Well, what about Allen the bridegroom?

14:56.877 --> 14:59.245
I mean, isn't he worried about
being drafted and sent over?

14:59.312 --> 15:02.415
He's 4F. He's got a herniated thing.

15:02.482 --> 15:05.251
- Oh.
- I was always 4F, proud of it.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.020
I was psychologically unfit.

15:07.087 --> 15:09.222
The draft board told him that.

15:09.289 --> 15:11.024
- No.
- You know, I served proudly.

15:11.091 --> 15:13.059
I, uh, have a Purple Heart.

15:13.126 --> 15:15.228
I had a yellow streak.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.763
The revolutionary group
that calls themselves

15:17.898 --> 15:20.733
the Constitutional Liberation Army.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.004
Riots broke out on half
a dozen college campuses

15:24.070 --> 15:25.471
protesting the war

15:25.538 --> 15:28.274
and the present
administration's policies.

15:55.936 --> 15:58.771
They're very nice
people, Sidney and Kay.

15:58.838 --> 16:00.306
Oh, yeah, well, Sidney,

16:00.373 --> 16:02.142
he's one of my father's oldest friends,

16:02.208 --> 16:03.676
and they get along great,

16:03.743 --> 16:06.946
unless the subject of
Vietnam comes up of course.

16:06.947 --> 16:08.148
Sidney's a liberal?

16:08.214 --> 16:09.615
No, Kay is a liberal.

16:09.682 --> 16:11.717
Sid, he's an ostrich,

16:11.784 --> 16:14.054
lives his life with his
head in the sand, you know?

16:14.120 --> 16:17.257
And, Dad, he's that
classic Orange County type.

16:17.323 --> 16:19.692
Oh, God, I love the idea
of living in California.

16:19.759 --> 16:21.594
I've got so many friends out there.

16:26.066 --> 16:27.567
What are you thinking about?

16:27.633 --> 16:29.435
I don't know. Sometimes I just feel this

16:29.502 --> 16:33.239
tremendous guilt over not
getting drafted, you know?

16:33.306 --> 16:37.443
I mean, do I really want to
go into my father's business?

16:37.510 --> 16:40.180
Just, so many of my friends,
they're politically active,

16:40.246 --> 16:43.716
and, you know, we're living
in these exciting times

16:43.783 --> 16:46.452
where things are constantly changing.

16:46.519 --> 16:48.488
Maybe I should go into law school,

16:48.554 --> 16:51.391
do constitutional law, I don't know.

16:51.457 --> 16:53.026
Law is fascinating.

16:53.093 --> 16:54.827
And so many of my classmates,

16:54.894 --> 16:58.231
they're over in Vietnam, and
they're serving and fighting,

16:58.298 --> 17:00.600
and some of 'em are dying, and for what?

17:00.666 --> 17:02.011
Well, you can't think
about that too much.

17:02.035 --> 17:04.003
It'll drive you nuts.

17:04.037 --> 17:06.239
Be thankful you have a herniated disk.

17:06.306 --> 17:08.674
I guess.

17:08.741 --> 17:11.644
I do love that you struggle
with those thoughts.

17:11.711 --> 17:13.012
Struggle's right.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.847
It's enough to drive you crazy.

17:14.914 --> 17:17.050
I love you.

17:19.385 --> 17:21.521
We have to name one of
our kids after Sidney,

17:21.587 --> 17:24.790
or S. J. Muntzinger, as he
pretentiously writes under.

17:24.857 --> 17:27.560
He did introduce us.

17:27.627 --> 17:30.396
Yes, uh, maybe.

17:30.463 --> 17:32.232
He's a great kid, you know?

17:32.298 --> 17:34.900
And his parents should give me a medal

17:35.035 --> 17:37.037
for bringing the two of them together,

17:37.103 --> 17:39.305
because the girl is exactly

17:39.372 --> 17:41.174
what they always wanted for him.

17:41.241 --> 17:43.876
She's bright. She's lovely.

17:43.943 --> 17:45.111
She's educated.

17:45.178 --> 17:46.712
She's cultivated, you know.

17:46.779 --> 17:51.117
She's not one of those
crazy, dope-smoking hippies.

17:51.184 --> 17:53.386
Young love, it's so romantic.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.255
I know. I know. It's sweet to see them.

17:55.321 --> 17:57.390
Do you remember when you were trying

17:57.457 --> 17:59.359
to get me away from Henry Goodwin?

17:59.425 --> 18:00.636
You killed yourself trying to get...

18:00.660 --> 18:03.063
The fat, the fat, stuttering guy

18:03.096 --> 18:04.373
that had the crush on you, right?

18:04.397 --> 18:06.299
Yeah, he proposed to
me. He proposed to me.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.468
But what happened to him? My God.

18:08.534 --> 18:10.803
He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry

18:10.870 --> 18:14.440
and then made a billion dollars
over some drug he invented.

18:14.507 --> 18:16.485
Oh, well, you're lucky you
didn't wind up with him then,

18:16.509 --> 18:18.311
because, you know, you
got me instead, so...

18:18.378 --> 18:21.081
No, I do have you, and
I'm very, very happy

18:21.114 --> 18:24.084
to have the man, the
man who wrote commercials

18:24.150 --> 18:25.418
for the ad agency.

18:25.485 --> 18:27.653
That's right. It may
not be a Nobel Prize,

18:27.720 --> 18:29.989
but I did win something
for my commercial

18:30.090 --> 18:32.492
for the Earl of Sussex Frozen Fishbowls.

18:32.558 --> 18:34.227
- Yeah.
- Let's now forget that.

18:34.294 --> 18:36.729
You know, I always thought
that it would have been

18:36.796 --> 18:39.599
much better if they
were smaller fishbowls,

18:39.665 --> 18:41.901
because then that
way, not so many people

18:41.967 --> 18:43.103
would have choked on them.

18:43.169 --> 18:44.637
Yes, that was a little problem

18:44.704 --> 18:46.772
for the company for a while that we did.

18:46.839 --> 18:50.576
Uh, all I know is
that I wound up finally

18:50.643 --> 18:52.512
with the right woman, the right wife.

18:52.578 --> 18:53.913
- Oh.
- Could not be happier.

18:53.979 --> 18:57.417
We, we are very, very lucky people.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.352
Shall I say my prayers in the event

18:59.419 --> 19:02.955
that there's a God and I've
been wrong all these years?

19:03.022 --> 19:04.524
Do you think we should've...

19:04.590 --> 19:06.592
Do you think we should've
gone to Washington

19:06.659 --> 19:08.661
to demonstrate?

19:08.728 --> 19:11.897
Right, get some sleep.

19:11.964 --> 19:13.833
God bless the Muntzinger household.

19:13.899 --> 19:17.403
Yes, if you're listening,
that goes double for me.

19:17.470 --> 19:19.572
And if you happen to think
of any new tax loopholes

19:19.639 --> 19:21.174
my accountant hasn't thought of,

19:21.241 --> 19:24.143
just slip it into my dream tonight.

19:24.144 --> 19:26.312
Good night, honey. Sweet dreams.

19:26.379 --> 19:28.181
Ah, good night, good night.

19:28.248 --> 19:30.983
Hey, you know, you know who came up,

19:31.050 --> 19:33.153
whose name today when I was...

19:33.186 --> 19:35.388
Ugh, so tired.

19:35.455 --> 19:38.858
You know who my barber mentioned today

19:38.924 --> 19:40.159
in conjunction with me?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.862
Job. Can you believe that?

19:44.697 --> 19:45.631
Well, good night, honey.

19:45.698 --> 19:48.301
Oh, good night, good night.

20:05.251 --> 20:08.754
Jesus, oh, my God.

20:08.821 --> 20:10.956
What? What happened?

20:11.023 --> 20:13.293
I forgot to turn the alarm on.

20:13.359 --> 20:15.060
How could you forget
to turn the alarm on?

20:15.127 --> 20:16.367
You've turned it on every night

20:16.429 --> 20:18.398
since we moved in here 26 years ago.

20:18.464 --> 20:21.534
I know, but, you know,
better safe than sorry.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.204
Oh, don't, don't be paranoid.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.339
- Really, just relax.
- God, I'm...

20:26.406 --> 20:29.442
I'm not paranoid, but I'm so tired,

20:29.509 --> 20:31.019
I don't believe any...

20:31.043 --> 20:32.421
Honey, honey, don't be an old lady.

20:32.445 --> 20:33.879
Lie back down again.

20:33.946 --> 20:36.249
You're gonna survive one
night without a burglar alarm.

20:36.316 --> 20:38.384
Oh, geez.

20:38.451 --> 20:41.221
I wish I hadn't read "In Cold Blood".

20:41.287 --> 20:45.024
You know, they cut Mr. Clutter's throat.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.292
Okay. All right.

20:46.359 --> 20:47.936
Go downstairs and turn
the burglar alarm on,

20:47.960 --> 20:50.095
because we're not gonna
get any sleep until you do.

20:50.162 --> 20:52.565
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Go ahead.

20:52.632 --> 20:55.235
No, my shrink thinks I'm
paranoid, so I'm just...

20:55.301 --> 20:57.537
I'm too tired.

20:57.603 --> 20:58.738
That's fine.

21:43.983 --> 21:46.051
Did you hear that?

21:47.320 --> 21:48.788
Did you hear that?

21:48.854 --> 21:50.089
What?

21:50.155 --> 21:51.291
Why are you waking me?

21:51.357 --> 21:53.459
I thought I heard something.

21:53.526 --> 21:55.361
No, it's nothing.

21:55.428 --> 21:57.096
It's nothing. Leave me alone.

21:57.162 --> 21:59.432
Go to sleep.

21:59.499 --> 22:02.335
Believe me, there's nothin' doin'.
