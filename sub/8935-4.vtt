00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.937
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.072
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.076
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.945
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.313 --> 00:15.348
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.250
Yikes!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.085
Yaaaah...

00:21.921 --> 00:23.390
Yeaaaah!

00:23.390 --> 00:26.459
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.436
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.637 --> 00:39.305
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.575 --> 00:45.145
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.380
the Raccoons!!

00:47.380 --> 00:48.114
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.828 --> 01:03.163
The Evergreen
train station

01:03.163 --> 01:05.398
is usually a pretty quiet place

01:05.398 --> 01:08.268
But today, Cyril Sneer is
frantically preparing it

01:08.268 --> 01:10.403
for the arrival of Mr. Mammoth.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.839
He's coming to the forest
in few days time,

01:12.839 --> 01:14.374
looking to do business.

01:14.374 --> 01:17.544
I want this place
tip top and in ship shape!

01:17.544 --> 01:20.213
What are you doing?!
Going into hibernation?!

01:20.213 --> 01:21.848
The Bear: Ugh!

01:21.848 --> 01:23.983
Mammoth will be
here in three days

01:23.983 --> 01:26.920
and Sneer Industries is
rolling out the red carpet!

01:28.488 --> 01:29.823
Oooff!

01:30.356 --> 01:32.892
Pop, it's going to
take more than a red carpet

01:32.892 --> 01:34.961
to get Mr. Mammoth's business.

01:34.961 --> 01:38.231
Remember what he said last
year when he passed us by?

01:38.231 --> 01:41.301
Sneer Industries have
nothing new to offer.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.870
What does that
ridiculous rhino know anyway?!

01:43.870 --> 01:45.338
But don't worry son,

01:45.338 --> 01:47.640
he won't pass us by this year.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.242
Boss, we've done it!

01:49.242 --> 01:52.779
We've created the product that
will impress Mammoth and also...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.747
Cut the blab,
bacon breath.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.149
Let's see what you've got!

01:56.149 --> 01:59.719
Pig 2: It's the start of a
complete line of air fresheners!

01:59.719 --> 02:02.422
Ohoo! We call this one...

02:02.422 --> 02:04.757
Pig 3: The Stink Stomper!

02:04.757 --> 02:07.494
Pig 2: The best part is,
every air freshener

02:07.494 --> 02:09.796
comes in six different boxes,

02:09.796 --> 02:11.631
of which, one is bound to match

02:11.631 --> 02:13.933
the buyer's personal decor.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.603
Pig 1: It's a multitude
of fragrances

02:16.603 --> 02:18.304
somewhat reminiscent of

02:18.304 --> 02:21.674
fresh lilacs on
a spring morning.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.944
I can't smell a thing!

02:24.944 --> 02:27.814
Pig 1: It's uh, subtleness
is sooooo enticing.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.215
Pig 2: Heh heh, the formula

02:29.215 --> 02:32.352
is a carefully guarded secret.

02:32.352 --> 02:35.188
Passed from generation
to generation.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.190
You three will
be the last generation,

02:37.190 --> 02:39.125
if you don't tell
me what's in it!

02:40.727 --> 02:43.530
Pig 1: A quarter cup of
water and a breath mint.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.466
What?!! Did you think
you could fool someone

02:46.466 --> 02:48.268
with a nose like this?

02:48.268 --> 02:50.970
Get back to the lab and
punch this product up!

02:50.970 --> 02:54.407
But Pop, I've been
working on some ideas myself!

02:54.407 --> 02:55.875
That's nice son,

02:55.875 --> 02:58.545
but right this minute I've...
Woooow!

02:58.545 --> 03:00.346
Coming through!!!

03:00.346 --> 03:02.448
Cedric! Have you seen it yet?!

03:02.448 --> 03:03.716
Seen what, Bert?

03:03.716 --> 03:05.518
The train that's coming!

03:05.518 --> 03:07.620
It-it's huge!

03:07.620 --> 03:10.223
Mammoth!
He's three days early!!

03:10.223 --> 03:12.392
Pig 2: Three days, four hours

03:12.392 --> 03:14.794
and ten minutes to be exact.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.930
Pig 3: I got ten days,
four hours and...

03:16.930 --> 03:18.398
Never mind that now!

03:18.398 --> 03:20.099
It's show time!!!

03:29.842 --> 03:31.177
Ahem!

03:31.177 --> 03:33.079
Greetings from Sneer Industries

03:33.079 --> 03:35.615
and welcome to the most
profitable stop

03:35.615 --> 03:37.250
on your long journey!

03:37.250 --> 03:38.885
Who wrote this drivel?

03:41.287 --> 03:42.522
Ahhh!!!

03:45.024 --> 03:47.293
What in blue
blazes is this?!

03:47.293 --> 03:50.430
It looks like... garbage!

03:52.832 --> 03:55.435
Ahh ahh ahhhh!

03:56.102 --> 03:57.737
Looks like someone's
finally found a way

03:57.737 --> 04:00.540
to cool off Cyril.
Hi there, I'm Sid and...

04:00.540 --> 04:02.141
I don't care who you are!

04:02.141 --> 04:04.877
You're not Mammoth and this
isn't the Mammoth-mobile!

04:04.877 --> 04:08.114
What's the big idea of dumping
this garbage all over the place?

04:08.114 --> 04:10.116
I want this eyesore out of here!

04:10.116 --> 04:12.719
So move this mess! Capiche?

04:12.719 --> 04:15.355
Come on, Pop. We
haven't got much time,

04:15.355 --> 04:17.190
and you wanted to
tour your factories

04:17.190 --> 04:19.392
before Mr. Mammoth gets here.

04:20.159 --> 04:23.896
Now, that's the most
unfriendly man I've ever met.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.932
Ah, Cyril only
acts like that

04:25.932 --> 04:28.701
when he gets... dumped on.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.271
Actually, he acts
like that all the time.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.006
Where are you headed
with all this garbage?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.241
Well, according to
my transportation papers,

04:35.241 --> 04:37.310
this is the end of the line.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.912
This garbage is
staying right here.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.148
In the
Evergreen forest?!

04:43.249 --> 04:46.986
Ha! Ha!
Factory 1-9-8-4!

04:46.986 --> 04:49.622
Made a lot of money
producing this stuff!

04:49.622 --> 04:51.291
Sneer Snake Oil!

04:53.092 --> 04:56.496
Guaranteed to prevent
dandruff, aging, arthritis,

04:56.496 --> 04:59.332
hair loss and the common cold!

04:59.332 --> 05:01.901
Pop, no one would
believe all this!

05:01.901 --> 05:04.771
That doesn't matter now,
I'm shutting this place down.

05:04.771 --> 05:05.872
The Bears: Huh?!?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.007
I've got to
concentrate all my efforts

05:08.007 --> 05:10.376
on new products at
my other factories.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.945
It's such a waste to
throw all this stuff out!

05:12.945 --> 05:16.182
There must be something
Sneer Snake Oil can do?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.017
Has it ever been tested?

05:18.017 --> 05:19.319
Tested?! No.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.689
Ahh, this brings back memories.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.124
Saved me more than
once from laryngitis!

05:25.124 --> 05:27.493
Gee Pop, you
have to test a product.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.464
If a product does one thing well
then you can really sell it.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.033
These are some of my ideas!

05:34.033 --> 05:36.669
Hey! These
look pretty good!

05:36.669 --> 05:40.073
But I'm all tied up with this
Mammoth tour right now, son.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.842
I haven't had any time to
run tests or this factory...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.310
I could run this place.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.213
Pop, I want a chance
to be in charge

05:47.213 --> 05:50.550
and see if my ideas work.
Please?

05:50.550 --> 05:51.984
Boss, this is it!

05:51.984 --> 05:56.556
The new and improved version
of the Stink Stomper.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.491
Pig 2:
We added some kick.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.060
It can even be used
as a cleaning fluid.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.362
Pig 3: Oops!

06:02.362 --> 06:05.465
You cloven-hoofed
chemical clod hoppers!

06:05.465 --> 06:08.167
I want you to stay
here and help Cedric!!!

06:08.167 --> 06:11.871
And I want you two to get
back to the lab pronto!!

06:11.871 --> 06:13.005
Ah-oh-ho!

06:13.005 --> 06:15.541
Ha ha!
I just love this thing!

06:15.541 --> 06:18.010
Son, you wanted a chance
to run a factory,

06:18.010 --> 06:19.545
and I'm going to give it to you.

06:19.545 --> 06:23.249
I need a new product and
you may be my only hope.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.852
Thanks, Pop!
I won't let you down.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.588
I'll have the results of the
tests in a couple of days

06:28.588 --> 06:30.390
and then you can...
That's no good, son.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.925
I need a finished product
in a couple of days.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.595
Give me the test
results in 12 hours.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.531
I know it's late,

06:38.531 --> 06:41.000
but could you just
check your records?

06:41.434 --> 06:42.602
Yes, I'll hold.

06:42.602 --> 06:43.870
According
to these records,

06:43.870 --> 06:46.672
this train has been to every
station along the line.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.341
But who sent it?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.877
Couldn't we just
ask Sid where it came from.

06:50.877 --> 06:51.944
Sid doesn't know,

06:51.944 --> 06:54.547
he only started driving
the train yesterday.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.782
Yes?

06:56.883 --> 06:58.251
Thanks anyway.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.721
Well, that's one more station
that didn't send the garbage.

07:01.721 --> 07:05.391
Well, why are people
shipping their garbage anyway?

07:05.391 --> 07:06.959
Hey guys! These papers

07:06.959 --> 07:08.995
list the garbage
on the train as cargo,

07:08.995 --> 07:12.732
and the railway's policy is,
'all unclaimed cargo is

07:12.732 --> 07:15.201
to be disposed of
within seven days!'

07:15.201 --> 07:17.036
Hoo, ha ha! Great!

07:17.036 --> 07:18.638
Bert, do you
know where the railway

07:18.638 --> 07:21.073
disposes of unclaimed cargo?

07:21.073 --> 07:22.542
The nearest dump!

07:22.542 --> 07:26.446
You mean, we get stuck
with all that rotting garbage?

07:36.722 --> 07:39.659
Ah-aah!

07:39.659 --> 07:43.062
The chemical make-up
appears to be the same...

07:43.863 --> 07:46.799
Bingo!!! But it has
to be tested on...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.936
...someone.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.338
Oh, I gotta stay awake!

07:56.943 --> 08:01.447
Pig 1: Wake up Mr.
Ce-boss, time's up!

08:01.447 --> 08:03.483
Oh! Gee thanks.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.651
Are there any results yet?

08:06.686 --> 08:08.387
Wow! This is terrific!

08:08.387 --> 08:10.089
I've got to tell Pop!

08:11.524 --> 08:14.427
Pop! I've got the test results

08:14.427 --> 08:16.095
and Sneer Snake Oil

08:16.095 --> 08:18.231
works as a sun block!

08:18.231 --> 08:23.469
I'll have this factory pumping
out Sneer sun block in no time!

08:23.469 --> 08:26.038
Pig 2: Great work, boss!

08:26.038 --> 08:28.074
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

08:29.308 --> 08:32.812
Um.. Hi, I'm Cedric Sneer.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.347
Uh, the new boss?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.783
Anyway, I've got some
really exciting news.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.685
We're getting a raise?

08:41.153 --> 08:44.657
Uh, no! Um...
What I have to say is...

08:44.657 --> 08:47.793
Uh, we're going to start
manufacturing a new product.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.562
We'll all have to work harder,

08:49.562 --> 08:51.797
around the clock if necessary.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.834
This factory is going to turn
out a hot new product

08:54.834 --> 08:56.802
and make a profit again!

08:58.404 --> 09:00.606
It's quitting' time!

09:00.606 --> 09:03.376
Wait!
We have to be a team!

09:05.645 --> 09:07.380
Hey Cedric!

09:07.380 --> 09:10.850
Gee, this is some
setup you've got here!

09:10.850 --> 09:12.752
Oooh, and you're the boss!

09:12.752 --> 09:15.588
Oooh! A real
captain of industry!

09:15.588 --> 09:19.559
Uh, listen Cedric, I have to
deliver all these notices.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.727
We're having a big meeting
tomorrow to discuss

09:21.727 --> 09:23.229
the garbage problem.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.298
Do me a favor and post
one in your factory.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.167
See you there, captain!

09:28.167 --> 09:31.571
Yeah... some captain.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.940
A captain on a sinking ship.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.312
Listen, Mammoth,
I'm talking new!

09:39.312 --> 09:42.949
I'm talking exciting!
I'm talking Sneer Sun Block!

09:46.218 --> 09:48.354
Great, I've got him primed,

09:48.354 --> 09:50.423
pumped and ready to purchase!

09:50.423 --> 09:53.526
Pig 3: Oh boss, we finally
have it perfected!

09:53.526 --> 09:56.095
Forget it! Your
product's low on my list.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.164
Right now I've got to get
over to Cedric's factory,

09:58.164 --> 10:00.466
to make sure that assembly
line is in high gear!

10:00.466 --> 10:03.269
Pig 2: But boss,
Stink Stomper now comes

10:03.269 --> 10:05.972
in an industrial-sized
dispenser.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.908
You can freshen up the
whole forest with this!

10:10.943 --> 10:14.113
Ah, the formula's just
a little unstable, boss.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.048
You two are
a little unstable!

10:16.048 --> 10:17.149
Get that out of here!

10:18.951 --> 10:20.820
Now bring the limo around front!

10:26.525 --> 10:28.828
Pig 2: You know,
it's such a nice day,

10:28.828 --> 10:30.329
perhaps we should walk?

10:31.330 --> 10:32.932
Pig 1: Pink slips?!!!

10:32.932 --> 10:35.668
Oh, you're giving us
all the big boot?

10:35.668 --> 10:38.104
No, they're
stock certificates!

10:38.104 --> 10:41.841
Everyone here now owns a
little bit of this company.

10:41.841 --> 10:45.578
If the company makes a profit,
we all make a profit!

10:45.578 --> 10:49.749
Pig 1: Wow! Profit sharing!

10:49.749 --> 10:52.151
I hope everyone
is just as excited,

10:52.151 --> 10:54.820
because that's the kind of
enthusiasm we'll need

10:54.820 --> 10:57.623
to get things really
rolling around here!

10:57.623 --> 10:59.325
Pig 1: Hey boss, come here!

11:00.526 --> 11:04.096
Hooray, hooray!!!!

11:04.096 --> 11:05.498
What's going on here?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.734
Why is everyone laying around
like bearskin rugs!!

11:09.468 --> 11:10.870
Profit sharing!!!

11:10.870 --> 11:12.505
Whose big idea is this?!!!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.440
It's my big idea, Pop!

11:14.440 --> 11:17.610
Cedric? Sneers
don't share profits!

11:17.610 --> 11:20.680
If you're having
problems, try this.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.315
No Pop! I told
you, I had new ideas,

11:23.315 --> 11:25.284
and I want to do
things my own way.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.820
I'm the boss.
You said so yourself!

11:27.820 --> 11:29.989
Of course I did, son.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.658
Don't you trust
me to get the job done?

11:32.658 --> 11:34.860
Of course I do, son.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.530
I guess I shouldn't
be horning in.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.466
I'll get out of your way. Boss.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.534
Thanks, Pop!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.335
All right team!

Here Pop, you keep the
first bottle as a souvenir.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.217
There'll be plenty
more of these soon.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.253
Pig 1: Oh, I wouldn't be
too sure of that, boss.

13:07.253 --> 13:09.255
The factory is nearly
out of supplies

13:09.255 --> 13:10.389
and I can't order more in,

13:10.389 --> 13:13.425
because the train
station is closed!

13:13.425 --> 13:14.493
Closed?!

13:14.493 --> 13:16.729
Why, that means Mammoth
can't get here either!

13:16.729 --> 13:18.330
It's the
trash train, Pop.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.999
There's a meeting
today to decide

13:19.999 --> 13:21.467
what should be done with it.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.271
There's only one
thing to do... move it!

13:25.271 --> 13:27.373
We're holding this
meeting in the Evergreen dump,

13:27.373 --> 13:30.643
so everyone can see just
what the problem is.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.877
Garbage!

13:31.877 --> 13:33.646
I haven't been able
to track down

13:33.646 --> 13:36.015
where the trash train
came from yet,

13:36.015 --> 13:38.851
but it looks like it's going
to be unloaded right here.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.587
We need a new dump.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.956
Brilliant idea, Raccoon!

13:43.956 --> 13:46.425
And where do you
propose we put it!?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.861
Well, that's
what we have to discuss.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.097
How about somewhere
on all that vacant land,

13:52.097 --> 13:54.366
around the Raccoon-Dominium?

13:56.101 --> 13:57.803
Well, if
that's a problem,

13:57.803 --> 13:59.939
how about the West side?

13:59.939 --> 14:03.342
Hey!!!!
That's where we live!

14:03.342 --> 14:05.511
Someone shipped
this garbage to us,

14:05.511 --> 14:08.314
so we ship it to someone else!

14:08.314 --> 14:10.349
But that's not
solving the problem!

14:10.349 --> 14:12.685
That's just passing it along!

14:12.685 --> 14:14.220
It solves our problem.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.856
We can take care
of our own trash!

14:16.856 --> 14:19.625
But this forest is
not a giant dump

14:19.625 --> 14:21.393
for everyone else's garbage.

14:21.393 --> 14:24.230
I say, we sent it
back down the line!

14:24.230 --> 14:25.998
Send it home!!!

14:25.998 --> 14:28.100
(chanting) Send
it home, send it home!

14:28.100 --> 14:30.336
Take the trash
and send it home!

14:30.336 --> 14:33.138
Send it home! Send it
home! Take the trash...

14:33.138 --> 14:35.841
Wait! Listen!
This isn't the answer! We...

14:35.841 --> 14:39.378
Enough talk. All in
favor? Raise your hand!

14:40.579 --> 14:43.215
Cedric, you're not
buying this, are you?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.384
Well Bert,
I need that train moved,

14:45.384 --> 14:47.519
or I'll have to lay
off all my workers.

14:47.519 --> 14:49.555
They have families to feed.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.056
It's settled then!

14:51.056 --> 14:53.158
The train leaves tomorrow!

14:56.262 --> 14:59.331
Sending this
train on just isn't right.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.367
We did the
best we could, Ralph.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.904
Maybe this story we're doing
will open some peoples' eyes.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.538
Oops!

15:06.538 --> 15:09.074
Don't worry about that
Bert, I'll clean it up.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.645
Hey Melissa,
someone else has good taste!

15:12.645 --> 15:15.247
Heh heh.
My favorite peanut butter!

15:15.247 --> 15:18.050
Ralph,
look what Bert found!

15:18.050 --> 15:21.520
Gee Melissa, it's only an
empty peanut butter container.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.590
And it's only
sold in the Evergreen forest.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.926
Do you guys realize
what this means?!

15:26.926 --> 15:30.229
Yeah, it means the
garbage on this train

15:30.229 --> 15:32.798
is from the Evergreen forest!

15:32.798 --> 15:35.701
And that means,
I'm not going anywhere.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.638
Pig 2: And that means the
boss is going to go crazy!

15:43.242 --> 15:44.977
What?!
The train isn't leaving?!

15:44.977 --> 15:46.378
What happened?

15:46.378 --> 15:49.448
Pig 2: Uh, well, it seems
that the Evergreen dump

15:49.448 --> 15:52.618
has been shipping garbage
out of the forest for months.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.787
But now, all the dumps are full

15:54.787 --> 15:57.122
and no one wants the trash.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.291
Pig 3: It's the
start of a serious

15:59.291 --> 16:01.760
environmental crisis
that everyone is...

16:01.760 --> 16:05.164
It's the start of a
serious monetary crisis for me!

16:05.164 --> 16:07.566
If that train isn't
gone by tomorrow,

16:07.566 --> 16:10.469
Mammoth and all his
money will pass us by!

16:10.469 --> 16:13.405
I don't care what it takes,
or how you do it...

16:13.405 --> 16:15.474
Get rid of that train!!!

16:15.474 --> 16:17.609
Ohhhh, yes boss!

16:18.510 --> 16:20.913
It's all
our garbage, Cedric.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.115
We can't send the train on.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.418
I hope, this doesn't mean,
you'll have to shut down?

16:26.418 --> 16:27.653
Don't worry, Bert.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.189
When I thought my supplies
were going to be cut off,

16:30.189 --> 16:31.957
I started rationing.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.158
See these bottles?

16:33.158 --> 16:37.329
I calculated I could make them
thinner and save plastic.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.298
Here come the first ones now.

16:39.298 --> 16:42.501
Hey! Neat idea Cedric!

16:42.501 --> 16:44.870
Oops! Sorry Cedric.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.172
Oh no! They're too thin!

16:47.172 --> 16:50.342
I've got to re-check
my calculations!

16:50.342 --> 16:51.977
Can I help Cedric?

16:51.977 --> 16:54.847
Oh! This has
turned into such a mess!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.849
C'mon it's
not your fault, Cedric.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.183
These things happen.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.353
It is my fault!
I'm the boss!

17:01.353 --> 17:03.622
Oh sure, Cedric.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.625
I'll just get out of your way.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.626
Ouch!

17:08.894 --> 17:12.865
Stupid lights! Stupid
factory! Stupid job!

17:13.966 --> 17:16.035
Pop's going to kill me!

17:22.841 --> 17:24.843
Pig 3: Why are we on the roof?

17:24.843 --> 17:27.479
Pig 2: Because we're
fearless commandos

17:27.479 --> 17:30.382
and all commandos
sneak across roofs.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.352
Look! Our primary goal!

17:33.352 --> 17:35.054
I think it's unguarded!

17:35.054 --> 17:37.823
Pig 3: Who would guard garbage?

17:37.823 --> 17:41.994
Pig 2: Commandos never
take unnecessary chances.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.229
Oomph!

17:44.229 --> 17:47.066
Pig 3: Ooh! I think
I pulled a tenderloin!
Pig 2: Shh!

17:51.837 --> 17:53.772
Darn, it's locked!

17:53.772 --> 17:57.843
Pig 3: Oh well.. I guess,
that's the end of this mission.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.045
Pig 2: Commandos never quit!

18:00.045 --> 18:02.047
They just go to plan B.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.750
We can't move this
train off the tracks,

18:04.750 --> 18:09.054
but we can blow it off
with Stink Stomper!

18:09.054 --> 18:11.190
Pig 3: What time should
we set them to blow?

18:11.690 --> 18:12.724
Huh?!

18:12.724 --> 18:14.393
I hope you know,
what you're doing.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.195
Run!!!

18:17.596 --> 18:19.398
Pig 3: Oh no! It's leaving!

18:22.267 --> 18:25.070
I must say, you
boys did a fine job

18:25.070 --> 18:26.572
of taking out the garbage!

18:26.572 --> 18:28.941
I've got big plans for you two!

18:28.941 --> 18:31.710
Pig 2: Gee, thanks boss!

18:33.045 --> 18:34.446
Here comes Mammoth!

18:34.446 --> 18:36.782
Let's not make any mistakes.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.784
Cyril, we've
gotta talk to you.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.787
What do you interfering
fur balls want now?

18:41.787 --> 18:45.624
We want to know why Sneer
Industries moved the train?

18:45.624 --> 18:46.959
I don't know, what
you're talking about!

18:46.959 --> 18:50.662
No? We got the records
from the station master.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.499
Last night, Cedric signed
for the cargo on the train.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.668
Cedric took the train?!

18:57.102 --> 18:59.104
What is there,
an echo in here?

18:59.104 --> 19:01.940
Pig 3: No, but there's a
bomb on that train!

19:01.940 --> 19:03.342
Bert/Ralph/Melissa: A bomb?
A bomb!!

19:06.712 --> 19:08.413
Mr. Mammoth says...

19:08.413 --> 19:09.781
Out of my way,
bird brain!

19:09.781 --> 19:11.917
Let's go!
Cedric's in real trouble.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.253
Hurumph! I say there!

19:20.592 --> 19:23.428
There he is!
Catch up to him!

19:26.298 --> 19:29.301
Cedric!!! Get off the train!!

19:29.301 --> 19:31.703
There's a bomb on board!!

19:31.703 --> 19:34.473
♪ (tense music) ♪

19:34.473 --> 19:35.807
I can't keep up with him!

19:35.807 --> 19:37.442
I've got to get to him!

19:37.442 --> 19:38.644
Whaaahh!!

19:42.848 --> 19:44.082
Bert!!

19:46.385 --> 19:47.553
Cedric!!

19:54.893 --> 19:57.996
Boy, it's a good
thing we jumped, Bert!

19:57.996 --> 20:01.333
Hooo. Yeah! Are you okay?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.868
I'm all right.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.405
Gee. It sure smells
nice around here...

20:06.405 --> 20:08.373
Like breath mints!

20:11.210 --> 20:12.711
The factory has
undergone some

20:12.711 --> 20:14.846
last minute changes, gentlemen.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.883
But the heart of my
operation... is garbage.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.017
Garbage?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.353
The garbage is
sorted and the plastic,

20:21.353 --> 20:23.589
metal and glass is taken out.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.991
Right now we're only
using the plastic.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.427
Then it's melted down
in this machine,

20:28.427 --> 20:32.030
poured into molds and comes
out as plastic bottles.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.332
This is great!

20:33.332 --> 20:36.268
You thought of this all
by yourself, Cedric?

20:36.268 --> 20:39.871
No. I had some
help from a friend.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.941
Mr. Mammoth says:

20:42.941 --> 20:45.544
'This is just the sort of
thing he is looking for

20:45.544 --> 20:48.880
and is most eager
to negotiate a deal.'

20:48.880 --> 20:52.251
Well Mammoth, you're
going to have your hands full,

20:52.251 --> 20:54.052
because you'll be dealing with

20:54.052 --> 20:57.256
two very shrewd businessmen.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.959
Cedric's first venture
into the business world

21:00.959 --> 21:02.961
was a resounding success.

21:02.961 --> 21:06.198
And along the way, he helped
reduce the Evergreen forest's

21:06.198 --> 21:09.801
garbage problem by discovering
that one man's garbage,

21:09.801 --> 21:11.737
is another man's treasure.

21:11.737 --> 21:14.940
There's big bucks
in this recycling business!

21:14.940 --> 21:18.710
So, I only think it's fair
that you boys get to do

21:18.710 --> 21:20.946
some profit sharing of your own!

21:20.946 --> 21:22.814
Pig 1: That sounds great, boss!

21:22.814 --> 21:24.916
I want you to
go through this dump

21:24.916 --> 21:27.619
and recycle everything you can!

21:27.619 --> 21:31.623
Pig 2: B-b-b-but boss!
What about the profit sharing?

21:31.623 --> 21:34.459
You two porkers can
share the work 50/50,

21:34.459 --> 21:36.595
and I'll take all the profits!

21:36.595 --> 21:39.498
Haha! Now get to work!!!

21:39.498 --> 21:42.567
Hahahaha!
I really love this thing!
