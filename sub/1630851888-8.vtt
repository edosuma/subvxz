08:11.975 --> 08:16.161

08:16.312 --> 08:18.404

being woken up.

08:18.557 --> 08:20.406
- Zack?

08:20.559 --> 08:21.241
- So, at the time, though,
I didn't realize

08:21.335 --> 08:22.559

a conversation on the phone,

08:39.186 --> 08:40.410

09:24.714 --> 09:25.955
Sometimes you gotta be
a little more realistic

09:26.049 --> 09:27.381
And a little more patient.

09:27.475 --> 09:28.975
And I think that
that's something

09:29.127 --> 09:30.293
He's starting to realize.

09:30.312 --> 09:31.795
Hopefully, they can
figure that out together.

09:31.888 --> 09:34.055

it's like,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.815

09:35.967 --> 09:37.742
With very minor situations--

09:37.969 --> 09:38.985

That's what--that's--now,
that why I'm so nervous,

09:42.082 --> 09:43.807
Because, like, the reason
why my past relationships,

09:43.825 --> 09:46.067
You know, haven't worked out
was because of the way,

09:46.086 --> 09:47.902
You know, my girlfriends were.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.495
They were very confrontational,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.340
- Spa.

15:51.359 --> 15:53.600
- Ooh. Yes.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.011
- You know I'm, like, a--
I'm, like, a relax

15:55.029 --> 15:56.679
On vacation kind of person.

15:56.698 --> 15:58.105
- That's the best way to be.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.349
- We're definitely different.

16:00.368 --> 16:01.684
- In what ways?

16:01.703 --> 16:04.611
- The first thing I saw was,
not a big traveler.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.024
I mean, she was terrified
on that plane.

16:08.042 --> 16:10.784
She comes across as very
high-stress, high-anxiety,

16:10.804 --> 16:12.470
And that is a concern of mine.
- Yeah.

16:12.697 --> 16:14.621
- I'm the complete
opposite of that.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.717
I find myself
being even more carefree

16:17.869 --> 16:18.534
Just to try to make light
of the situation...

16:18.627 --> 16:21.204
- Right.
- For her sake.

16:21.297 --> 16:25.374
Outside of the plane, there was
some kayak anxiety in the keys.

16:25.468 --> 16:28.486
Manatee! He's right under you.

16:28.637 --> 16:29.545
- I don't like it.
- Look, look, look.

16:29.564 --> 16:31.047
- I can't. I don't like it.

16:31.065 --> 16:33.049
- At least, like, look at it.
- I looked at it!

16:33.142 --> 16:34.567
Not a fan, not a fan,
not a fan.

16:34.719 --> 16:35.067
- It's right by you. Look down.
- I can't.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.828
- Look!

16:37.055 --> 16:38.479
- I can see it
in my peripheral vision.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.497
- We'll have to work on that.

16:39.648 --> 16:41.482
- Would I have
picked that activity?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.392
No.
- No.

16:43.411 --> 16:45.986
- Did I do it? Yes.
Would I do it again? Maybe.

16:46.006 --> 16:46.653
- You'll do it
if he wants you do it.

16:46.748 --> 16:49.156
- That's what I said.

16:49.175 --> 16:49.674
- Yeah, you wouldn't do it
on your own.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.342
- No.
- No.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.402
But if somebody
who you care about

16:53.421 --> 16:54.828
Really wants you to do it,

16:54.848 --> 16:55.662
You'll force yourself,
and you'll do it.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.922
- That's why I did it.

16:57.075 --> 16:57.423
- And you'll do it with a smile
on your face.

16:57.575 --> 16:59.350
- I did it.

16:59.502 --> 17:00.167
- Have you guys been
intimate yet?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.927
- We have not.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.080
I mean, we're affectionate,
to an extent.

17:04.173 --> 17:06.006
That was all comfortable
and easy.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.768
And we've stayed
in the same bed every night.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.421
- So do you feel as though
the attraction's there?

17:12.440 --> 17:15.199
How'd you like seeing him
shirtless on the beach?

17:15.426 --> 17:18.094
I don't know, I'm just saying,
you get to--

17:18.112 --> 17:19.945
- Keep telling him he's like
an action figure.

17:20.098 --> 17:21.522
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

17:21.616 --> 17:23.690

like, he feels the same way?

17:39.300 --> 17:40.541
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:40.635 --> 17:41.617
- Mm-hmm.
- That's good.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.895
- I don't think
that's a problem.

17:44.046 --> 17:45.546
- Attraction is there.
- Yeah.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.714
And for me, it's been growing.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.642
- Mm-hmm?
- A lot.

17:49.794 --> 17:51.235
- It is growing, and I hope
that does continue to grow.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.571
- Wow.

17:53.722 --> 17:56.148
- 'cause she's
an attractive woman.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.651
There's just, there's
so many things to consider.

17:58.803 --> 18:00.394
I mean, it's a huge,
huge thing.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.229
- Yeah.
- Like, this is my marriage.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.748
- Right.

18:03.975 --> 18:05.566
- There's a lot of positives
about it.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.478
I'm seeing more and more
positives every day.

18:09.572 --> 18:12.998
Arms are gonna be
useless tomorrow.

18:13.151 --> 18:14.884
- Well, you'll look sexy

18:18.264 --> 18:20.323

- It's a nice place.
- You like it?

18:31.760 --> 18:32.351
- It is.
- It's nice, huh?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.262
Going into the marriage,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.615
I already had so many
positive thoughts about johnny,

18:37.766 --> 18:40.025
And he expressed the same.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.361
<i> But because we're diving</i>
<i> in deep so quickly,</i>

18:42.513 --> 18:45.272
<i> I feel like now</i>
<i> we're having to learn</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:47.683
That we're both not perfect
and we have our flaws

18:47.702 --> 18:50.277
And we have our boundaries
that we need to establish.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.923
So you know my husband,
johnny lam.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.526
It's just so weird
to say, actually.

18:57.545 --> 19:01.622
Like, every day I wake up
and he's next to me,

19:01.641 --> 19:02.381
And I turn over, and I'm like,
"I'm married to johnny lam."

19:02.475 --> 19:04.642
- That is crazy.

19:04.793 --> 19:05.718
- It's just so bizarre,
you know?

19:05.870 --> 19:07.536
- Yeah.
- Like--like, I know him.

19:07.555 --> 19:08.795
He knows me.

19:08.890 --> 19:11.798
- I was worried that,
in your head, you thought,

19:11.818 --> 19:12.875
"I'm gonna marry a stranger."

19:12.894 --> 19:15.227
- Yeah.
- And then you saw johnny.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.637
And I was just like,

19:16.656 --> 19:17.655
"she's gonna have
a moment of, like,

19:17.882 --> 19:19.231
'this is not what
I signed up for.'"

19:19.384 --> 19:20.232
- Honestly, though,
as soon as I saw him...

19:20.326 --> 19:22.160
- Yeah.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.477
- It was a shock moment,
and a moment of,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.404
Like, "oh my god."

19:25.498 --> 19:30.559
You know, everything I know
of him just spun immediately,

19:30.578 --> 19:32.503
And I had a moment of doubt.

19:32.655 --> 19:35.339
Just that second was just,
like, "johnny, the party boy.

19:35.566 --> 19:39.585
"johnny, the frat guy.
Johnny, the bro. Johnny"--

19:39.737 --> 19:41.995
Like, a lot of negativity
in that moment,

19:42.015 --> 19:43.664
Just because it's, like, wait,
my expectation was,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.165
I would be matched
with someone I don't know

19:45.185 --> 19:47.334
That's the perfect match
for me.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.503
But everything that I know
of him, some of it is great,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.355
But there's some disconnect
here in my head.

19:51.507 --> 19:54.099
So it's just like, "wait."

19:54.194 --> 19:56.752
But every step towards
the altar, I started thinking,

19:56.771 --> 19:59.588
"I get it. It makes sense."

19:59.607 --> 20:02.091
I mean, I'm so introverted.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.351
He's so outgoing
and extroverted and friendly.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.353
I'm guarded. He's open.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.854
There's some things there
that I'm like,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.932
I see the complementary
pieces of it.

20:09.951 --> 20:11.692
And then, on the honeymoon,

20:11.711 --> 20:12.935
When we started
having disagreements,

20:12.954 --> 20:15.938
And we both kind of reacted
differently--

20:15.957 --> 20:18.290
He's a little dismissive.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.701
Like, he just doesn't take
a lot of stuff seriously.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.702
- I think there's
a lot of pressure.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.888
- Definitely.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.614
- Because, when you spend
so long not thinking about

20:25.708 --> 20:26.782
Another person's perspective--

20:26.875 --> 20:30.043
He's been alone
for how many years now?

20:30.137 --> 20:31.954
- Eight.
- Eight years.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.564
He hasn't really dated anybody
for a long time.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.882
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Nothing serious.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.568
So even though
he wants to try, like,

20:37.720 --> 20:39.904
It takes
a little bit of time to--

20:40.055 --> 20:41.630
- Yeah.
- To get used to that, right?

20:41.649 --> 20:43.983
To not think so selfishly.

20:44.135 --> 20:45.892
- There's sometimes
a disconnect

20:45.912 --> 20:47.303
Between what he says he wants

20:47.396 --> 20:51.749
And what he actually,
like, demonstrates, in a way.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.251
Like, he'll tell me he's still
in it, he's not giving up.

20:53.478 --> 20:55.068
- Right.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.146
- But I can see
when he gets deflated,

20:57.239 --> 20:58.314
And it affects
our communication.

20:58.332 --> 21:01.150
- I see.
- You know? He just shuts down.

21:01.168 --> 21:02.593
And just a couple days ago,

21:02.820 --> 21:05.912
He told me that
he needs time apart

21:05.932 --> 21:08.081
Because he still needs
to process.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.083
And I was like,
"why do you do that?

21:10.103 --> 21:12.085
You know, you're married now.
It should be different."

21:12.105 --> 21:13.512
And johnny was like, "it was
the reset that I needed."

21:13.606 --> 21:18.667
I'm like, "I didn't need
no [bleep] reset, okay?"

21:18.686 --> 21:19.777
- Some guys just withdraw.

21:19.928 --> 21:22.113
Like, it's not because--

21:22.264 --> 21:23.355
It's not that
they're not into it.

21:23.508 --> 21:24.931
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not like they're trying.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.692
It's just that they need
a little bit of time

21:26.786 --> 21:30.121
Just to withdraw and get
their thoughts into things.

21:30.348 --> 21:32.606
But that doesn't mean
he's not committed, right?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.016
I mean, especially if you
haven't been with somebody

21:34.035 --> 21:36.368
For eight years, it's tough.

21:36.521 --> 21:37.611
- I mean, overall,
I still think

21:37.630 --> 21:39.279
That we were matched
for the right reasons.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.449
- Yeah.
- I'm still super optimistic.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.785
I'm not the one
ducking and running.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.530
- You think, if anyone ducks
and runs, it'll be johnny?

21:47.548 --> 21:49.548
- It would be johnny. Yeah.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.309

Long time no see.

22:14.483 --> 22:16.817
- Johnny boy.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.818
Being able to hang out
with the guys,

22:17.912 --> 22:20.245
I always feel like
this is like war,

22:20.398 --> 22:21.505
<i> And these guys are</i>
<i> in the trenches with me,</i>

22:21.732 --> 22:23.490
<i> So I'm really glad</i>

22:23.509 --> 22:24.991
And just talk about

22:25.011 --> 22:26.159
- Open and honest.
- Open and honest.

22:26.253 --> 22:26.844
- Two weeks.
- Yeah!

22:27.071 --> 22:29.180
- Open and honest. Hey.

22:29.331 --> 22:30.589
- Salud, salud, salud, salud.
- Come on, man.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.998
- Absolutely.

22:32.093 --> 22:35.019
- So what are you guys
doing for your housewarming?

22:35.246 --> 22:38.080
- I'm latino, man.
We're going pura fiesta, man.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.598
- [scoffs]
- so, yeah, bro.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.842
Really excited about it.
It's gonna be kind of cool.

22:41.936 --> 22:43.844
So it's, like, a mexican theme.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.845
- Nice.
- Y'all know I love brunch.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.364
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

22:46.515 --> 22:47.848
- And so I'm ordering
from lucille's.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.683
- Wow!
- Ooh.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.759
- That's why she was in the gym
with me this morning,

22:50.778 --> 22:52.185
So she can eat this food.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.353
- That's why I was in the gym,

22:53.373 --> 22:54.855
So I can eat
the freaking mac and cheese

22:54.874 --> 22:56.040
And the freaking
croissant french toast.

22:56.191 --> 22:57.375
- We were thinking just
island-themed,

22:57.526 --> 22:57.950
Because it was--

22:58.102 --> 23:00.044
Well, why not?

23:00.271 --> 23:01.270
'cause we kind of went
to an island a little bit,

23:01.363 --> 23:02.213
The florida keys,
kind of, sort of.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.864
It was like, okay,
let's do island--

23:03.883 --> 23:05.624
- Bao, you stop right there.
We did not go to the islands.

23:05.776 --> 23:07.367
But okay.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.612
- It's not hawaii,
but it was island-y.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.222
- You're gonna like my deal.

23:11.449 --> 23:12.539
I got some boudin
coming from lake charles.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.541
- Okay.
- Hey!

23:14.560 --> 23:16.452
- I got some frozen daiquiris
coming.

23:16.470 --> 23:18.211
Some real frozen daiquiris.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.212
- Hey, but do you got
the crawfish coming, though?

23:19.306 --> 23:20.881

- Aw.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.066

impressive charcuterie board

23:22.217 --> 23:23.550
You've ever seen coming.

23:23.644 --> 23:24.793
- Yes!
- Cool, cool.

23:24.812 --> 23:25.978
- Tough question.
- Yeah.

23:26.130 --> 23:27.721
- Married life--
what you expected?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.740
Different than what
you expected?

23:32.561 --> 23:33.652
- I think the expectations were
far beyond what I expected

23:33.804 --> 23:36.062
In regards
to just the chemistry,

23:36.082 --> 23:38.398
The connection and all--
you know, I mean,

23:38.492 --> 23:40.584
We really can't, honestly,
keep our hands off each other.

23:40.811 --> 23:42.903

I was gonna interject.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.163
So you didn't see it,

23:44.257 --> 23:46.239
But they can't keep
their hands off each other.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.240
- Yeah, if she was here,
they would have already kissed

23:47.334 --> 23:49.485

He's clear of covid.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.534
We're getting through it.

You know, sickness--
through sickness and health.

24:23.521 --> 24:24.853
- Yeah.

24:24.872 --> 24:26.446

like, next day.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.465

"we're gonna test it.

24:27.616 --> 24:28.966

24:41.372 --> 24:42.646

And still trying
to figure it out.

24:54.051 --> 24:55.400
How are you guys doing?
How's everything?

24:55.495 --> 24:56.735
- I'm good. Yeah.

24:56.887 --> 24:57.978
- It's been a tough week,
an adjustment, for sure.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.056
- I will say it's been a long,
tough week.

25:01.075 --> 25:02.391
Like, you know, just the
adjusting of, like, the times.

25:02.409 --> 25:04.076
- The schedules and stuff.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.411
- And the new home and
the no food in the fridge yet.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.654
- I think, to me, it feels
a little hotel-ish still.

25:07.748 --> 25:09.398
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:09.416 --> 25:10.508
- 'cause you don't have
all your stuff.

25:10.659 --> 25:11.675
- Not that home feeling yet.
Yeah.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.177
- So, like, the home
feeling isn't there.

25:13.328 --> 25:15.346
- But as far as, like,

25:15.573 --> 25:16.755
Being with ryan
in the apartment, that's great.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.590
Like, that's, like,
the whole point, right?

25:18.684 --> 25:20.500
- Yeah.
- Is to...

25:20.520 --> 25:21.519

the easiest, at least for me.

25:21.746 --> 25:22.186
- That's the
easiest part for me too.

25:22.337 --> 25:24.580
- No scary habits.

25:24.598 --> 25:25.748
Nothing--you know, no red flags
or anything for me.

25:25.766 --> 25:26.932

a dating/friend thing.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.867
- Correct.

25:37.019 --> 25:39.094
- And that's something that
we're gonna have to work on.

25:39.113 --> 25:40.279
- That's--I mean, I think,
we're, like--

25:40.431 --> 25:42.097
We're around there too.
- Yeah.

25:42.190 --> 25:43.265
- Mainly with her,
because, like,

25:43.358 --> 25:44.024
I still haven't
even got a kiss.

25:44.118 --> 25:45.692

- Yeah.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.936

25:50.124 --> 25:51.364
Like, how do you
feel about that?

25:51.384 --> 25:52.608
- Still--nah, it's not
bothering me yet.

25:52.701 --> 25:54.626
- He's lying.
- I think eventually it will.

25:54.779 --> 25:56.612
It will--it's like
one of those ingrown hairs

25:56.630 --> 25:58.222
That, it's small,
it starts off a little bit.

25:58.449 --> 25:59.390
- So at which point, though,
are you like,

25:59.541 --> 26:00.783
"okay, this is--
I can't do this anymore"?

26:00.801 --> 26:01.950
- I don't know.
- You know what I mean?

26:01.969 --> 26:03.376
- I don't know.
That's a good question.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.620

reach that point.

26:04.713 --> 26:05.896

when it's gonna be.

26:06.048 --> 26:07.547
- Yeah.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.215

- Yeah.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.052
Yeah. And he was surprised.
- Yeah.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.386
- He was like,
"man, not even a peck?"

26:13.406 --> 26:14.387
- Yeah.
- And he was--she was like--

26:14.481 --> 26:16.648
- I bet he grilled her.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.559
- Yeah, he got on her.
He got on her. So we'll see.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.244
I mean, we talking
about a future, so obviously...

26:20.395 --> 26:21.912

26:22.064 --> 26:23.488
- There's something there.
- Yeah.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.583

comes around and is ready.

26:25.810 --> 26:26.992

lost five bucks to me.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.569
- What?

26:29.589 --> 26:32.314
- 'cause we had a bet about you
and gil having a kiss.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.332
And y'all didn't, so I won.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.818
'cause I said,
"no, she's not going to."

26:35.836 --> 26:37.428
- Wait, have you? Still not?

26:37.579 --> 26:39.504
- Taking it slow.
- Wow.

26:39.657 --> 26:40.914
- I could not imagine
not having

26:40.933 --> 26:41.915
Kissed my husband
at this point.

26:42.009 --> 26:45.752
It's, like, living with someone

26:45.771 --> 26:47.420
And being with someone
all the time,

26:47.440 --> 26:50.682
It does accelerate
the feelings for me.

26:50.835 --> 26:53.760
Yay or nay on if you guys have
consummated your marriage yet?

26:53.779 --> 26:56.614
- Nay.

that's public information.

27:38.048 --> 27:40.716

she's friend-zoned?

27:40.809 --> 27:42.308

actually.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.496
She feels like
she is making advances,

27:45.647 --> 27:47.981

a little friendly right now.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.737
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

48:45.757 --> 48:48.999
- I didn't get a chance
to get a wedding gift, so.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.409
- Thank you, thank you.
- Is it fragile. Can I--

48:50.503 --> 48:51.576
- Yes. Very fragile.

48:51.671 --> 48:53.763
- Can I open it?
- Yeah, go ahead. Open it.

48:53.990 --> 48:55.431
- Have y'all met?
This is serena and brian.

48:55.582 --> 48:57.249
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
Anh and scott.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.176
- Yeah, so brian's my cousin.
He was at the wedding.

48:59.328 --> 49:00.937
- Yes.
- And serena's his wife.

49:01.164 --> 49:02.939
- Awesome.
- We're married for two weeks.

49:03.166 --> 49:04.273
You guys are married
for two months.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.257
How long have you guys
been married?

49:05.351 --> 49:06.183
- Since 2015.
- Oh.

49:06.335 --> 49:08.002
- Six years.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.003
- Six years.
- Six years. There we go.

49:09.021 --> 49:10.854
- Here goes. I'm opening it.

49:11.007 --> 49:12.431
- Let's see what you got.
- Feels like a book.

49:12.525 --> 49:13.783
- Oh, I hope it's a book.

49:13.934 --> 49:15.434
Hope it's a book
on relationships.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.453
- It is a book
on relationships.

49:17.604 --> 49:18.179
- Spoiler alert.

49:18.197 --> 49:21.273
[laughter]

49:21.292 --> 49:23.608
All: Oh!
- Yes! Yes!

49:23.703 --> 49:24.868
- "she comes first:

49:24.963 --> 49:28.022
The thinking man's guide
to pleasuring a woman."

49:28.040 --> 49:31.634
- It's a good book.
I insist that he reads it.

49:31.861 --> 49:33.360
- And what is this--
what is this fruit here?

49:33.454 --> 49:35.287
- Bro, you know what that is.

49:35.381 --> 49:36.621
- Thank you.
- Papaya?

49:36.641 --> 49:39.717
- Looks like a papaya?
- Oh, I don't eat papaya.

49:39.869 --> 49:41.477
- Just looking out
for you, bao.

49:41.628 --> 49:42.627
- It's kind of strange
that bao's friend

49:42.722 --> 49:45.873
Gave her a sex book.

49:45.891 --> 49:49.059
Maybe there's, like, hints on,
you know, getting there.

49:49.212 --> 49:51.228
Wherever "there" is.

49:51.380 --> 49:53.881
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

49:53.899 --> 49:55.324
This place is amazing, right?
- It is.

49:55.551 --> 49:58.661
- How has your expectation
of marriage been so far?

49:58.812 --> 50:01.238
- Um, I would assume
that normally,

50:01.390 --> 50:02.647
When you get married,
it's not this intense

50:02.742 --> 50:05.334
In just a short period of time.
It feels different.

50:05.486 --> 50:10.506
But I feel reassured that I'm
married to someone that I know.

50:10.733 --> 50:12.900
Having that familiarity
really does help.

50:12.918 --> 50:14.251
I feel it would be harder
if I were married to someone

50:14.403 --> 50:16.679
That I had
absolutely no background with.

50:16.830 --> 50:18.014
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

50:18.241 --> 50:19.907
- You know,
but at the same time,

50:19.925 --> 50:22.518
The other couples, they're kind
of taking their time

50:22.745 --> 50:24.520
Because they don't have
any background.

50:24.671 --> 50:26.580
So I think they're having,
like,

50:26.673 --> 50:29.767
Really, really petty fights,

50:29.861 --> 50:32.528
Where we are having, like,
more, like, deep--

50:32.679 --> 50:35.089
You know, deep conversations
and deep disagreements

50:35.107 --> 50:36.866
And trying to figure
those things out.

50:37.093 --> 50:38.442
- So you feel like
both of you are 100% in.

50:38.594 --> 50:42.946
- I feel I'm 100% in.
I feel like he's 90% in.

50:43.099 --> 50:44.765
- How's it been going thus far?

50:44.858 --> 50:47.785
Like, if you had to--if you had
to put a probability percentage

50:47.879 --> 50:49.286
On it, like, what are
you-what are you feeling?

50:49.438 --> 50:51.288
- Yeah. Um. It's really early.

50:51.440 --> 50:55.442
So two weeks in,
and even though we're married,

50:55.536 --> 50:57.111
I feel like I'm treating it

50:57.204 --> 50:59.221
As I'm going into
a fresh relationship,

50:59.373 --> 51:02.558
And I need to feel it out
before I feel certain.

51:02.785 --> 51:04.042
I want to fall in love
at some point.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.120
I'll be honest, I mean,
I'm not there yet.

51:06.138 --> 51:09.214
So probability, if I was,
like, a sportsmaker, right?

51:09.233 --> 51:11.642
Probably somewhere like 65.
- Okay.

51:11.794 --> 51:17.314
- What's the 35%
that is keeping you from that?

51:17.466 --> 51:19.391
- I feel like we need to get
closer somehow,

51:19.410 --> 51:21.393
And more intimate.

51:21.412 --> 51:24.747
And that's the thing I'm trying
to work on to build up

51:24.898 --> 51:26.231
Before I can fall for her.

51:26.325 --> 51:27.899
- Yeah.
- Understood.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.401
And that, you know,
like, takes time, man.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.312
That's all it is.

51:31.330 --> 51:32.813
- Like, you said that you're
a very open person,

51:32.832 --> 51:34.481
Put everything out, but she's
a big more guarded, right?

51:34.575 --> 51:35.758
So it might just take, again,

51:35.909 --> 51:37.909
A little more time for her
to be able to open up.

51:37.929 --> 51:39.653
- What are some tactics
to make, like,

51:39.672 --> 51:41.263
An introverted person
that's usually pretty guarded

51:41.415 --> 51:43.415
About sharing things
about herself?

51:43.434 --> 51:45.917
- From what I know about bao,

51:45.937 --> 51:48.345
Bao's got a lot of love
to give,

51:48.497 --> 51:50.497
But you gotta accept all of it.

51:50.516 --> 51:52.349
And I think, if you do that,

51:52.501 --> 51:55.427
You'll get the most out of her
as a person,

51:55.446 --> 51:59.431
And it'll ultimately end up
getting you guys to be closer.

51:59.450 --> 52:00.950
Be all in.
- Yeah.

52:01.177 --> 52:04.102
- And I think
if you're able to do that,

52:04.122 --> 52:06.122
You'll unlock
some pretty special things.

52:06.273 --> 52:08.773
- He knows I'm all in.
I'm all in.

52:08.793 --> 52:10.684
I'm gonna work
at whatever I can

52:10.703 --> 52:13.020
To make the marriage work.

52:13.113 --> 52:15.706
But I also need him
to be 100% in too.

52:15.800 --> 52:16.523
- Well, and she acknowledged
that she wasn't

52:16.617 --> 52:19.026
At that love point yet.

52:19.044 --> 52:21.137
So maybe her saying
that she's all in

52:21.364 --> 52:23.455
Is just that she's willing
to do the various things

52:23.474 --> 52:25.307
That are necessary to,
like, build that foundation

52:25.534 --> 52:27.292
To eventually lead you guys
to that stage...

52:27.311 --> 52:29.461
- Yeah.
- Where you are in love,

52:29.480 --> 52:31.221
Which is what you're committed
to doing as well, so.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.982
- I'm committed just learning
as much as possible

52:33.133 --> 52:34.541
About her
and figuring out, like,

52:34.560 --> 52:37.060
If our relationship has
the legs to go the distance.

Both: Yes.

53:22.608 --> 53:24.107
- Okay.
- Let's go.

53:24.260 --> 53:26.685
- Once I saw my girls...
[laughs]

53:26.779 --> 53:29.446
That's all I needed.

53:29.540 --> 53:33.934
It's been an interesting
kind of start to our marriage.

53:33.953 --> 53:34.526
You know, we've only
been married two weeks.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.770
- Yeah.
- Right.

53:36.789 --> 53:38.439
- So that's even more so of a--

53:38.457 --> 53:40.958
We done gone through a lot
in two weeks.

53:41.052 --> 53:42.534
Like, I didn't know
it was gonna be this intense.

53:42.628 --> 53:43.944
Whew. I don't know, y'all.

53:44.037 --> 53:46.129
I know I'm a strong person,
but this [bleep] hard.

53:46.224 --> 53:47.130
- You're strong.

53:47.283 --> 53:47.890
I feel like if it was anybody

53:48.041 --> 53:49.391
To do it, it would be you.

53:49.543 --> 53:51.227
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

53:51.378 --> 53:54.137
- But, you know, we are working
through all those things,

53:54.290 --> 53:55.456
You know,
like learning each other,

53:55.549 --> 53:57.624
Getting better
at communicating,

53:57.718 --> 53:59.884
And our communication styles.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.128
- That's good.

54:01.146 --> 54:02.554
You know, in every situation,
let's grow.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.132
- Yeah, and arguments
have to happen.

54:05.150 --> 54:06.224
- Yeah.

54:06.244 --> 54:07.392
- Right?
- Are you neat one?

54:07.486 --> 54:08.577
- He is very clean.

54:08.729 --> 54:10.804
- That's good.
- So I really do like that.

54:10.823 --> 54:12.248
He is a toothpaste crusher,
though.

54:12.475 --> 54:14.083
- Oh, that's a problem.
- Oh, the middle?

54:14.310 --> 54:15.251
The middle?
- He crushes everything.

54:15.478 --> 54:16.310
- I mean, we can teach him,
right?

54:16.403 --> 54:17.828
He's teachable, right?
- Yeah.

54:17.922 --> 54:18.495
But, you know, I'm not
even trying to teach him.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.481
He's okay.

54:20.499 --> 54:21.815
- Aw, look at you,
accepting him however he is.

54:21.908 --> 54:24.167
- Yeah, however he is.
- Okay.

54:24.262 --> 54:26.595

I'm happy you're here.

thank you.

55:33.664 --> 55:34.163
- Yeah, and I'm happy
you're part of the family.

55:34.314 --> 55:36.332
So marriage life.

55:36.483 --> 55:40.336
- It's definitely been an
adjustment, both good and bad.

55:40.487 --> 55:42.338
And so what really kind of
took me over the top

55:42.565 --> 55:44.064
Was saying,
"hey, the housewarming's off,

55:44.083 --> 55:45.841
And, you know, I'm not coming,"
or whatever.

55:46.068 --> 55:47.751
- Yeah, we got that message.
- Yeah.

55:47.903 --> 55:49.845
- Yeah, and that was really--

55:50.072 --> 55:51.088
That kind of sent me
over the top.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.255
It's a very difficult situation

55:52.408 --> 55:52.923
Because I'm not used
to those outbursts,

55:53.017 --> 55:54.074
Like, out of the blue,

55:54.093 --> 55:56.243
Because, again,
I just don't know,

55:56.261 --> 55:58.020
Like, what caused that
and what happened,

55:58.171 --> 56:00.080
And so that's what I want
to ask you guys.

56:00.099 --> 56:02.099
Like, you know,
is this kind of usual for her?

56:02.193 --> 56:03.600
And, like, how do you
kind of get around this?

56:03.752 --> 56:05.194
Because this, for me,
personally, is something

56:05.421 --> 56:06.362
That I'm gonna have trouble
dealing with.

56:06.589 --> 56:07.529
- Mm-hmm.
- But I want to make this work.

56:07.681 --> 56:09.923
And I don't know
if I can if, like, this--

56:09.942 --> 56:11.367
These things keep happening.

56:11.594 --> 56:13.035
- I don't think
it's a usual thing.

56:13.262 --> 56:14.444
- Okay.
- It's nothing that's usual.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.113
It's nothing that's gonna
continue to, like, happen.

56:16.265 --> 56:17.689
Because once she's comfortable,

56:17.708 --> 56:18.932
You won't have to worry
about any of that.

56:18.951 --> 56:21.101
She is the most, like,
level-headed, like,

56:21.194 --> 56:23.212
Sane person you'll ever meet.
- Mm-hmm.

56:23.363 --> 56:24.713
- But this whole situation,
I know--

56:24.865 --> 56:26.048
I mean, even for you,

56:26.275 --> 56:27.216
It's probably
super uncomfortable.

56:27.367 --> 56:29.793
I think while she's out
of this, like,

56:29.945 --> 56:31.720
Comfort zone for her...
- Yeah.

56:31.872 --> 56:34.114
- I think you're gonna get

56:34.207 --> 56:35.724
A couple sides
that she's not typically.

56:35.951 --> 56:38.710
- Right.
- Until she gains that trust.

56:38.804 --> 56:39.786
But that's also where she needs
to start communicating

56:39.880 --> 56:42.973
With you better in the moment.

56:43.125 --> 56:45.142
- So how has it been this far
with zack?

56:45.294 --> 56:46.402
I know it's only been
two weeks,

56:46.629 --> 56:48.478
But a lot can happen
in two weeks.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.313
- I've noticed that
we are both strong-willed

56:50.466 --> 56:52.574
And strong-minded individuals,

56:52.726 --> 56:54.726
And I'm a married woman,

56:54.820 --> 56:57.228
And I do have to be considerate
of other peoples' feelings.

56:57.248 --> 56:58.989
Especially his. Especially his.
- Right.

56:59.141 --> 57:01.141
- He's such an amazing
and beautiful man,

57:01.160 --> 57:04.253
Inside and out,
that I can't do these things--

57:04.480 --> 57:06.738
These vindictive things,
essentially--

57:06.757 --> 57:08.331
And think that it's okay.
- Right.

57:08.484 --> 57:09.073
- Because I may lose
my marriage,

57:09.168 --> 57:10.484
And I don't want to.

57:10.502 --> 57:12.761
I came here to be married...

57:12.913 --> 57:15.322
- Exactly.
- And to work through it.

57:15.415 --> 57:16.765
And it's hard.
It's hard for both of us.

57:16.992 --> 57:19.493
And I think we both
have to learn

57:19.511 --> 57:21.678
What is and what is not okay.
- Right, right.

57:21.772 --> 57:24.681
How do you think
the communication is thus far?

57:24.833 --> 57:26.667
- It could be better.
- It could be better?

57:26.685 --> 57:28.685
- I think, on both of our ends.

57:28.837 --> 57:29.686
On my end, I bite my tongue.

57:29.838 --> 57:32.673
And I just do.
- Right.

57:32.691 --> 57:34.024
You'll bit your tongue,
and then you'll react.

57:34.118 --> 57:36.601
And that might be
a drastic action sometimes.

57:36.620 --> 57:38.603
- Yes.
- Okay.

57:38.697 --> 57:41.790
Zack historically has been used
to relationships where,

57:41.942 --> 57:44.776
You know, most people would
kind of define them as toxic.

57:44.870 --> 57:48.188
His partner sometimes wasn't
that good at communicating.

57:48.281 --> 57:50.299
Some of them were
pretty immature.

57:50.450 --> 57:52.693
So that's why communication
is so big for him.

57:52.711 --> 57:54.544
So you know, you sit down
and you talk to him

57:54.697 --> 57:56.379
About something,
and you're upset, you know,

57:56.474 --> 57:57.864
Handle it differently
than most people would, right?

57:57.883 --> 58:00.309
You know, it's okay
to feel however you feel.

58:00.536 --> 58:01.960
No one can invalidate
your feelings.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.127
If you're upset,
you can be upset.

58:03.147 --> 58:05.205
You can be angry.

58:05.224 --> 58:07.298
When you talk to him,
you know, be different.

58:07.318 --> 58:09.559
Talk to him calmly.
Tell him how you feel.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.378
Tell him that you're upset,
tell him you're angry,

58:11.396 --> 58:13.972
And explain why, you know,
and say it respectfully.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.382
- I don't know if she's
admitted to you, but I know

58:15.475 --> 58:17.976
She's admitted to me things
that she could do better.

58:18.070 --> 58:20.996
She needs to be telling those
to you if she hasn't already.

58:21.147 --> 58:22.647
- We haven't had
that conversation.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.407
- Yeah, and I think--
I'm sure y'all will.

58:24.502 --> 58:27.410
- This definitely comes down
to communication.

58:27.505 --> 58:29.004

into, like, parenting.

58:29.155 --> 58:30.655

1:03:14.274 --> 1:03:15.682
I think you don't
have anything.

1:03:15.775 --> 1:03:16.625
All the other stuff,
that's all lust.

1:03:16.776 --> 1:03:17.942
- Agreed. Yep.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:20.462
- There's a place that we need
to get past,

1:03:20.613 --> 1:03:23.114
From, like, friend
to relationship, marriage-wise.

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:25.191
I mean, hopefully we get there.

1:03:25.285 --> 1:03:26.635
I mean, that's where
we are now.

1:03:26.786 --> 1:03:30.472
- But, like, for me, like,
I definitely want to know more

1:03:30.623 --> 1:03:32.549
Regarding, like, his feelings
for me specifically.

1:03:32.701 --> 1:03:34.868
- Yeah.

1:03:34.886 --> 1:03:37.554
- I think at the time
and place that brett and ryan

1:03:37.706 --> 1:03:39.873
Are at, it's hard--
it's kind of, like--

1:03:39.966 --> 1:03:41.465
- It's fresh.
- Yeah, it's fresh.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.819
It's like a cute chess game
because you're still trying

1:03:44.046 --> 1:03:46.062
<i> To figure out</i>
<i> what you can and cannot share.</i>

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:48.990
<i> I think if ryan is more open</i>
<i> with how he feels,</i>

1:03:49.142 --> 1:03:51.051
She will feel reassured
to be herself,

1:03:51.144 --> 1:03:52.719
And she will open up more.

1:03:52.812 --> 1:03:55.664
She just needs, like,
the cliché term--

1:03:55.815 --> 1:03:57.648
Like, if you water her,
she will grow.

1:03:57.742 --> 1:03:59.909
- We've let everything happen,
like, just naturally,

1:04:00.003 --> 1:04:02.579
And I think that's--
it is a slower process

1:04:02.731 --> 1:04:04.564
Because we're pretty adamant

1:04:04.583 --> 1:04:06.174
About that's how we want
it to happen.

1:04:06.326 --> 1:04:08.068
- That's the best part,
I think,

1:04:08.086 --> 1:04:09.160
Is that you're both coming
at it from that mind space

1:04:09.254 --> 1:04:11.680
Of, like, "we're committed."

1:04:11.831 --> 1:04:12.514
- But again, we only have--
we have eight weeks, so.

1:04:12.741 --> 1:04:14.757
- I know.

1:04:14.852 --> 1:04:15.851
- It is a rush thing
that we're trying not to rush.

1:04:16.078 --> 1:04:17.835
- Yeah.

1:04:17.929 --> 1:04:19.003
- And that's kind of
where we are now.

1:04:19.022 --> 1:04:20.355
- Yep.

1:04:43.622 --> 1:04:45.455
- No.
- Not excited?

1:04:45.607 --> 1:04:47.123
- This is a lot
for an introvert.

1:04:47.275 --> 1:04:49.384
- I'm all into housewarming.

1:04:49.611 --> 1:04:50.777
Like, I love going
to housewarming parties.

1:04:50.795 --> 1:04:52.036
- Oh, no.
- I would throw one.

1:04:52.130 --> 1:04:53.555
- If somebody invited me,
I probably wouldn't go.

1:04:53.782 --> 1:04:54.631
- Oh.
- I would send them a gift.

1:04:54.783 --> 1:04:55.724
- No, I would go, for sure.

1:04:55.875 --> 1:04:57.800
- I'd be like,
"here you go. Gift card."

1:04:57.953 --> 1:05:00.228
My husband and I have been
married for almost two weeks,

1:05:00.380 --> 1:05:03.306
But I think there is just
so much more to learn from him,

1:05:03.458 --> 1:05:07.551
<i> Every day or every opportunity</i>
<i> or every activity that we do,</i>

1:05:07.571 --> 1:05:09.963

Taking advice

1:05:11.909 --> 1:05:13.816
<i> Through it--they've been</i>
<i> married or divorced,</i>

1:05:13.911 --> 1:05:15.652
<i> And they are willing</i>
<i> to share the mistakes</i>

1:05:15.746 --> 1:05:18.747
That they've made to help us
flourish in our marriage.

1:05:18.974 --> 1:05:20.974
- Has there been a fight yet?
- No.

1:05:21.067 --> 1:05:21.641
- Not yet.
- Are you surprised?

1:05:21.734 --> 1:05:24.235
- He's very patient.

1:05:24.254 --> 1:05:25.979
- I--actually, I didn't expect
y'all to have any fights.

1:05:26.072 --> 1:05:27.571
- Yeah, me neither.
- Why not?

1:05:27.591 --> 1:05:29.332
- Like, from what
I know of gil...

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:30.500
- Right. Yeah.

1:05:30.594 --> 1:05:33.153
- You are, like,
the female version of him,

1:05:33.171 --> 1:05:35.004
From what I can tell, right...
- So far, yeah.

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:35.913
- In the short amount of time
that we've known you.

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:37.157
- Oh!

1:05:37.175 --> 1:05:38.749
- Minus--
- nice to know.

1:05:38.769 --> 1:05:39.935
- As far as temperament
is concerned.

1:05:40.086 --> 1:05:41.252
- Oh, yes, temperament,
for sure.

1:05:41.271 --> 1:05:42.829
- There's nothing not
to like about y'all.

1:05:42.922 --> 1:05:44.255
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:45.256
So you're like, "okay, so
I don't like that dress..."

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:47.609
- I am pretty wonderful.

1:05:47.836 --> 1:05:49.018
- And she'll be like,
"well, get over it."

1:05:49.112 --> 1:05:50.594
"all right, maybe she'll just
wear the blue one--

1:05:50.614 --> 1:05:51.854
I mean the pink one
tomorrow instead."

1:05:51.949 --> 1:05:53.840
I mean, that's just kind of
how I see it going.

1:05:53.858 --> 1:05:55.008
- Okay.

1:05:55.026 --> 1:05:56.509
It's kind of been
like that, pretty much.

1:05:56.602 --> 1:05:58.027
It's pretty much
been like that.

1:05:58.121 --> 1:06:00.346
- What you mean, "okay"?
What does "okay" mean?

1:06:00.365 --> 1:06:01.197
- Oh, no, I like the dress.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:04.108
[laughter]

1:06:04.127 --> 1:06:05.351
Y'all haven't seen
her closet, though.

1:06:05.370 --> 1:06:07.187
- I think that's easy.
- How's her closet?

1:06:07.205 --> 1:06:09.205
Is it organized more than you?
- No, this closet--no.

1:06:09.299 --> 1:06:11.357
No, her closet is organized.
Her closet is organized.

1:06:11.376 --> 1:06:12.859
- Both of y'all are organized.
- No, but, like...

1:06:12.952 --> 1:06:14.469
- Well, no, he's no better.

1:06:14.696 --> 1:06:16.863
- The amount of stuff
in her closet,

1:06:16.881 --> 1:06:17.973
<i> Like, I can't</i>
<i> keep up with that.</i>

1:06:18.124 --> 1:06:19.623
<i> - I have a small closet,</i>
<i> though.</i>

1:06:19.643 --> 1:06:20.976
<i> - You mean here?</i>
<i> - It looks like--</i>

1:06:21.203 --> 1:06:23.203
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It's, like, 1/4 of that.

1:06:23.221 --> 1:06:27.056
- I've never seen a hanger
that's specifically made

1:06:27.209 --> 1:06:30.634
<i> To hold ten pairs of jeans</i>
<i> on one hanger.</i>

1:06:30.654 --> 1:06:31.802
And she has, like,
15 of those hanging.

1:06:31.822 --> 1:06:33.563
- It's three, sir.

1:06:33.657 --> 1:06:35.323
There's three per hanger.
He's being sarcastic.

1:06:35.475 --> 1:06:37.066
- It's not three.
- There are three.

1:06:37.219 --> 1:06:39.552
- You have like seven trus
on one hanger.

1:06:39.571 --> 1:06:41.496
- See the first argument, guys.

1:06:41.647 --> 1:06:42.646
- I'm sorry. I'll leave.

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:45.074
I didn't mean
to instigate anything.

1:06:45.168 --> 1:06:49.820
- My husband loves to joke
around about my standards

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:51.414
<i> And the things that I like.</i>

1:06:51.566 --> 1:06:53.082
He thinks that's funny.

1:06:53.176 --> 1:06:54.083
- Adrienne, how many pair
of jeans do you have?

1:06:54.236 --> 1:06:55.585
- Nine?

1:06:55.737 --> 1:06:56.327
- She got nine on one hanger.

1:06:56.346 --> 1:06:58.421
- Oh, girl, it's okay.

1:06:58.515 --> 1:07:00.256
- But, you know,

1:07:00.408 --> 1:07:01.908
I love that
we have that, like--

1:07:02.001 --> 1:07:04.835
We're able to go back and forth
and joke around about things.

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:06.354
And so you gotta have
a little bit of fun.

1:07:06.506 --> 1:07:07.856
- Looks delicious.
- Eat away, guys.

1:07:08.083 --> 1:07:09.265
- Yeah, y'all can start
digging in.

1:07:09.417 --> 1:07:11.417
Don't be shy now.
Don't be shy. Just grab it.

1:07:11.436 --> 1:07:12.919
- So hey, guys.

1:07:13.012 --> 1:07:14.420
- It's a lot of food.
What's up?

1:07:14.439 --> 1:07:16.939
- So how you guys been,
being married to a stranger,

1:07:17.092 --> 1:07:18.424
Waking up next to a stranger,

1:07:18.443 --> 1:07:21.928
Taking a shower next
to a stranger, or whatever?

1:07:21.946 --> 1:07:24.021
- We're not gonna go there.
- Not there? Okay.

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:26.190
- Other than that,
I think it's been good.

1:07:26.284 --> 1:07:27.542
I think one thing that's--

1:07:27.769 --> 1:07:29.360
I don't think
it's been surprising.

1:07:29.454 --> 1:07:32.955
But, like, it's been--it's felt
very natural and normal.

1:07:33.108 --> 1:07:34.716
Like, you wake up,
and you have someone,

1:07:34.867 --> 1:07:35.775
And you're living with them,
and you're doing things,

1:07:35.794 --> 1:07:36.292
And it's flowing,
and it's easy.

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:38.553
- That's good.

1:07:38.780 --> 1:07:40.113
- At which point does it
stop being easy?

1:07:40.131 --> 1:07:41.447
- Right.
- No, I'm kidding.

1:07:41.541 --> 1:07:45.042
- Yeah. I agree with my wife.

1:07:45.062 --> 1:07:47.303
It's been surprisingly smooth,

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:50.473
Like, to get into a marriage
with somebody you don't know,

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:53.068
And for it to kind of, like,
click like it's clicked--

1:07:53.219 --> 1:07:54.127
- That's good.

1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:55.886
- I feel very comfortable
with her.

1:07:55.906 --> 1:07:57.797
I feel like I've known her
for a while.

1:07:57.890 --> 1:07:59.407
There's still plenty that
I need to know

1:07:59.559 --> 1:08:02.226
That I don't know about her,
but for the most part,

1:08:02.245 --> 1:08:04.153
It's like, I know enough
that--to trust her.

from pastor cal.

- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

1:08:26.752 --> 1:08:29.011
- So pastor cal came
and spoke to us.

1:08:29.164 --> 1:08:31.922
Had a little
one-on-one therapy.

1:08:31.942 --> 1:08:33.775
One of the homework
that he gave us was--

1:08:34.002 --> 1:08:35.426
You know, when he left,
he was like,

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.948
"I want y'all to look
at each other's bank accounts."

1:08:40.175 --> 1:08:42.692
So we logged
into our bank accounts,

1:08:42.844 --> 1:08:44.360
We looked at our checkings,

1:08:44.512 --> 1:08:47.196
We looked at each other's
savings, and, yeah.

1:08:47.290 --> 1:08:49.198
- Who got higher savings?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:08:49.351 --> 1:08:51.017
- Oh, come on, now.
- I knew that. I knew that.

1:08:51.110 --> 1:08:52.368
- That's a vulnerable position
to be in.

1:08:52.462 --> 1:08:53.277
- I knew that.

1:08:53.371 --> 1:08:55.688
- So you're okay with her

1:08:55.707 --> 1:08:57.206
Maintaining
that same kind of lifestyle?

1:08:57.359 --> 1:08:58.782

another question we had.

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.860
Right?
- Mm-hmm.

1:09:00.879 --> 1:09:02.637

the one thing I'm not gonna do

I felt a certain type of way

They were very sweet.

from that conversation.

1:17:41.215 --> 1:17:42.657

1:17:42.884 --> 1:17:43.883

learning how you are,

1:17:43.976 --> 1:17:48.237
Like, in terms of--you know,

1:17:48.389 --> 1:17:49.479

1:17:49.573 --> 1:17:52.391

1:17:57.489 --> 1:17:59.656

1:17:59.676 --> 1:18:01.175
And well,
I already knew this--

1:18:01.326 --> 1:18:02.251
But it's how genuine you are.
- Mm-hmm.

1:18:02.403 --> 1:18:05.162
- And I knew that,
but it's, like,

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:06.255

that I understood fully

1:18:06.407 --> 1:18:08.849
How caring and present you are.

1:18:09.076 --> 1:18:11.577

1:18:11.595 --> 1:18:12.745
- How--what do you mean
you took advantage of that?

1:18:12.763 --> 1:18:15.080
What do you mean?
- With my behaviors.

1:18:15.099 --> 1:18:16.932
I'm not used to being
in a relationship,

1:18:17.084 --> 1:18:19.768
Let alone marriage,

1:18:19.862 --> 1:18:21.921
Where somebody is in it
as much as I'm in it.

1:18:21.939 --> 1:18:24.014
- Mm-hmm.

1:18:24.108 --> 1:18:28.610
- And so my behaviors were to,
I guess I can say, like, harm.

1:18:28.705 --> 1:18:29.778
And I [bleep].

1:18:29.931 --> 1:18:32.022
My reaction
was an overreaction.

1:18:32.116 --> 1:18:34.542
And I should not do that.

1:18:34.693 --> 1:18:36.452
- Got it--like,
how do you think I feel?

1:18:36.546 --> 1:18:38.287
- That you feel hurt.
I think you feel hurt.

1:18:38.439 --> 1:18:40.697
I think you feel abandoned.

1:18:40.717 --> 1:18:44.218
I think you feel like I'm not
actually serious about this,

1:18:44.369 --> 1:18:46.795
That I'm not here for you.

1:18:46.889 --> 1:18:49.615
And all those feelings
are valid but not true,

1:18:49.708 --> 1:18:50.874
Because at the end of the day,

1:18:50.893 --> 1:18:52.059
I do want
this marriage to work.

1:18:54.379 --> 1:18:55.637

I understand

1:18:55.790 --> 1:18:57.122

1:18:57.216 --> 1:18:59.400
How it can get to that point.

1:18:59.551 --> 1:19:00.717
That's not something
I'm good with,

1:19:00.737 --> 1:19:02.294
'cause, you know,
that's why my relationships

1:19:02.387 --> 1:19:03.571
Haven't working out
in the past.

1:19:03.798 --> 1:19:05.406

It hasn't worked out
for a reason.

1:19:11.414 --> 1:19:14.564
For me, personally, it's bigger
than a communication thing,

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:16.642
It's how we handle
the conflict again.

1:19:16.735 --> 1:19:18.494
