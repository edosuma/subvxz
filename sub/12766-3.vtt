I WANTED THE FAIRYTALE.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.041
I WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL
AND PERFECT.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.250
I WANTED--
THE MAGIC.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.959
EXACTLY.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.041
SOME MAGIC.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.750
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

10:19.792 --> 10:22.041
OKAY?

10:22.083 --> 10:26.959
ALL RIGHTY, THIS IS GONNA BE
A LITTLE COLD.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.750
OW.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.750
OKAY. I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.041
JUST TRY TO RELAX. OKAY?

10:34.083 --> 10:36.000
I AM RELAXED.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.041
OW!

10:40.083 --> 10:41.083
(sighs)

10:41.125 --> 10:43.709
YOU'VE HAD EXAMS
BEFORE THIS?

10:43.750 --> 10:47.083
OH, GOD. IT'S REALLY BROKEN.
IT'S BROKEN, ISN'T IT?

10:47.125 --> 10:50.375
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING
THAT BREAKS. OKAY.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.041
WE'RE GONNA GO REALLY SLOW.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.041
OKAY...

10:54.083 --> 10:56.041
KNOCKING AT THE DOOR.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.834
STOPPING IN
FOR A LITTLE VISIT,

10:58.875 --> 11:02.375
AND I'M KNOCKING.

11:02.417 --> 11:06.041
KNOCKING A LITTLE HARDER.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.375
OW! OW, OW, OW. (sighs)

11:08.417 --> 11:11.041
AND I'M DONE KNOCKING.
I'M GONNA DIE A VIRGIN.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.041
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT,
CATHLEEN.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.542
WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU
YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.375
OKAY?

11:18.417 --> 11:21.041
SHE'S 35, AND SHE'S NEVER--

11:21.083 --> 11:22.083
NOPE.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.834
AND THE GATES ARE CLOSED,

11:23.875 --> 11:26.041
LOCKED, WELDED SHUT.

11:26.083 --> 11:29.333
HOLDING ON TO YOUR VIRGINITY
FOR THAT LONG? I THINK IT'S SAD.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.041
IT'S NOT SAD. IT'S SWEET.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.458
OKAY, NOT BEING ABLE TO
HAVE SEX WITH YOUR HUSBAND

11:34.500 --> 11:36.458
WHEN YOU WANT TO,
THAT'S SAD.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.041
BUT THE WAITING?

11:38.083 --> 11:40.208
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WANTING A LITTLE MAGIC?

11:40.250 --> 11:43.208
I LOST MY VIRGINITY WHEN I
WAS 17. IT WAS NOT MAGIC.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.041
A LOT OF FRICTION.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.125
I GOT RUG BURNS
IN BAD PLACES.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.583
(laughs)

11:48.625 --> 11:51.208
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GET
THE MAGIC UNTIL SAM?
MM.

11:51.250 --> 11:55.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT COULD BE MAGIC UNTIL SAM.

11:55.041 --> 11:58.000
I HARDLY REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I HAD A LITTLE MAGIC.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.500
MMM. I HEAR THAT.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.041
MMM.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
(laughs)
WHAT? WHAT?

12:03.083 --> 12:06.041
HOW CAN YOU EAT THAT MUCH SUGAR
THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING?

12:06.083 --> 12:08.208
DELL MADE IT.
I'M JUST BEING POLITE.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.083
YOU KNOW, AND WHAT'S ALL THIS
MAGIC TALK ANYWAY?

12:10.125 --> 12:12.083
FIRST L.A. DOESN'T HAVE IT--

12:12.125 --> 12:13.875
I DON'T KNOW.

12:13.917 --> 12:17.834
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
I JUST FELT MORE... MAGIC-Y.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.083
WELL, YEAH. YOU KISSED PETE.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.500
I DID NOT KISS PETE.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.208
PETE KISSED ME,
WHICH I DID NOT ASK FOR.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.041
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE'S NORMAL.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.458
YOU KNOW, ONE MINUTE HE'S HOT,
THE NEXT MINUTE HE'S ARCTIC.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.500
I DON'T NEED
THAT KIND OF DAMAGE,

12:32.542 --> 12:34.125
NO MATTER HOW FANCY
HIS LIPS ARE.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.083
HERE HE COMES.

12:36.125 --> 12:40.750
♪♪♪

12:40.792 --> 12:43.041
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEX,
AREN'T YOU?

12:43.083 --> 12:45.041
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
A PATIENT...

12:45.083 --> 12:47.500
WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX.

12:47.542 --> 12:50.500
WELL, SEND 'EM MY WAY.
I'LL GET 'EM GOING.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.250
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS NEEDS,
WHO HAS WANTS,

12:53.291 --> 12:56.417
WHO NEEDS AND WANTS MAGIC
IN HER LIFE.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.041
THIS IS NOT
A DIRTY LITTLE JOKE

12:58.083 --> 12:59.750
THAT YOU CAN MAKE

12:59.792 --> 13:02.250
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE JOKES ABOUT,
DIRTY MAN.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.917
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.917
YOU THINK YOU DO,
BUT YOU DON'T.

13:06.959 --> 13:09.792
SO... DON'T CALL ME NAMES.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.166
YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM
A PASS THIS WEEK.
WHY?

13:17.208 --> 13:20.041
YOU JUST...

13:20.083 --> 13:22.000
SHOULD.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.041
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

13:25.083 --> 13:28.792
A CLUB. A CLOSED CLUB.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.208
(sighs)

13:33.000 --> 13:35.959
I WENT BACK ON MY VOW,
AND--AND NOW SHE'S BLEEDING?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.959
MY WORDS DID THAT.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.041
NO, YOU DON'T CONTROL
ANYTHING EXCEPT YOURSELF.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.166
OUR WORK TOGETHER
HAS NOT BEEN ABOUT

13:42.208 --> 13:44.166
GETTING YOU
TO LEAVE YOUR WIFE.

13:44.208 --> 13:47.333
IT'S BEEN ABOUT GETTING YOU
TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.166
REMEMBER THE GOALPOSTS, DOUG.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.333
THE GOALPOSTS.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.041
RIGHT.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.333
RIGHT.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.375
(laughs)

13:58.417 --> 14:00.417
SO SHE LOST SOME IRON.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.333
BIG DEAL.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.917
I WANT A DIVORCE.

14:04.959 --> 14:07.166
YES, YOU DO.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.333
KAREN, I...

14:09.375 --> 14:11.834
THE BLEEDING GOT A LOT WORSE.
I CHECKED HER C.B.C.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.125
HER HEMATOCRIT'S
LESS THAN 30.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.625
LESS THAN 30?
ARE--ARE YOU SURE?

14:15.667 --> 14:18.166
YOU MEAN THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY WRONG WITH HER?

14:18.208 --> 14:20.041
YES, THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.000
YOU PICKED A GREAT TIME
TO WALK OUT, DOUG. JUST GREAT.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.333
IT'S CALLED VAGINISMUS.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.333
IT'S A CONDITION THAT CAUSES

14:27.375 --> 14:30.041
A CONSTANT INVOLUNTARY
MUSCLE SPASM.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.625
SO YOU HAVE A WAY
TO FIX IT, RIGHT?

14:32.667 --> 14:34.458
YOU--YOU CAN FIX IT?

14:34.500 --> 14:37.458
NOT--NOT THAT I'M NOT FINE
THE WAY THINGS ARE. I'M FINE.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.208
I LOVE YOU,

14:39.250 --> 14:42.041
AND I DON'T NEED TO HAVE SEX
TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.083
YOU CAN FIX IT?
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU CAN FIX IT.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.875
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESCRIBE
A MUSCLE RELAXANT

14:46.917 --> 14:48.041
FOR YOU, CATHLEEN,

14:48.083 --> 14:50.417
AND YOU'D TAKE IT
ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE YOU--

14:50.458 --> 14:53.041
A PILL. THAT'S GOOD.
A-A PILL.
I CAN DO A PILL.
AND IT'LL WORK?

14:53.083 --> 14:55.041
WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN
CASE STUDIES.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.542
UM, JUST, UH...
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.083
(clears throat)

15:07.959 --> 15:09.417
AT--AT HOME.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.208
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT
AT HOME.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.917
(Naomi) AND SHE NEEDS TO DO
HER HOMEWORK AND SHOW IT TO YOU.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.917
AND SHE CAN TALK
ON THE PHONE,

15:15.959 --> 15:18.041
BUT DO NOT LET HER
GET ON THE INTERNET

15:18.083 --> 15:20.041
BECAUSE YOU STILL DON'T HAVE
THAT THING

15:20.083 --> 15:22.500
THAT BLOCKS
THE CHILD PREDATORS.
GOOD NIGHT, NAOMI.

15:22.542 --> 15:25.083
SHUFFLING MAYA BACK AND FORTH,
IT'S JUST NOT PRACTICAL.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.291
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.
MAYA'S GONNA BE FINE.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.500
YOU AND YOUR HEAD
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF.
IT'S JUST THAT SHE'S A GIRL.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.500
MOTHERS KNOW MORE
WHEN IT COMES TO GIRLS.

15:31.542 --> 15:34.041
UH, I'M--I'M SHUTTING DOWN
FOR THE NIGHT

15:34.083 --> 15:35.834
UNLESS YOU NEED ANYTHING.

15:35.875 --> 15:39.500
NO, UH, BUT, UH, HERE.
UH, HERE'S YOUR CAKE CARRIER.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.250
YOU ATE THE WHOLE THING?

15:41.291 --> 15:44.709
WE. I-I DIDN'T...
EAT A WHOLE CAKE.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.041
I MEAN, I C--
I WOULDN'T.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.041
I-I COULDN'T. I...

15:48.083 --> 15:50.083
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.000
WELL,
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

15:53.041 --> 15:55.125
UH... OKAY.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.500
OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.333
(elevator bell dings)

16:06.375 --> 16:08.458
STILL RAINING.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.125
YEAH. I SEE THAT.

16:13.417 --> 16:16.000
I MADE YOU ANOTHER ONE
LAST NIGHT.

16:17.709 --> 16:21.083
I R--
I-I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.125
(whispers) THIS TIME I BAKED
CHOCOLATE CHIPS INSIDE.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.583
I CAN'T. (laughs)

16:26.625 --> 16:29.166
THANK YOU.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.959
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE SOMEONE
ELSE MIGHT WANT IT.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.041
SO I'LL JUST, UH...
(normal voice) RIGHT.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.333
NO SEX.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.041
NOT EVEN A LITTLE SEX.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.041
REALLY? DID--OR--
REALLY?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.333
SHE TOOK THE PILL. SHE--

16:43.375 --> 16:45.083
WE TRIED. OH, SISTER,
HOW WE TRIED.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.166
HONEY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT OKAY.
I NEED SEX.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.834
I NEED SEX, GEOFFREY.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.834
I HAVE WAITED AND WAITED
AND WAITED,

16:51.875 --> 16:55.041
AND I WANT TO DO IT.
I WANT TO DO IT NOW.
LOOK, I KNOW,
I'M JUST SAYING,

16:55.083 --> 16:57.166
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET UPSET.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.166
WE HAVE OTHER THINGS
TO CONNECT US.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.166
YOU'RE A MAN, GEOFFREY,
A BIG, STRONG, VERY HOT MAN,

17:02.208 --> 17:04.041
WHICH IS...

17:04.083 --> 17:06.333
I HIT THE JACKPOT
WITH YOU.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.000
AND WE WANT KIDS.
WE WANT A FAMILY.

17:10.041 --> 17:13.000
WHICH IS NOW NOT GONNA HAPPEN
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE ME

17:13.041 --> 17:15.125
FOR SOMEONE ELSE--
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.792
I DON'T NEED SEX.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.875
WE DON'T LIE TO ONE ANOTHER.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.792
WE NEVER HAVE.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.917
DON'T START NOW.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.041
PLEASE, DOCTOR.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.583
PLEASE.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.083
OKAY... (sighs)

17:35.125 --> 17:37.792
NOTHING I'VE TRIED
HAS WORKED.

17:37.834 --> 17:41.500
I MEAN, SHE JUST CAN'T...
JU--SHE JUST CAN'T.

17:41.542 --> 17:45.792
AND SHE DESERVES--
HE'S... HER GUY, HER ONE.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.625
MARRIAGE WITHOUT SEX.
(sighs)

17:47.667 --> 17:51.166
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.166
MAYBE IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.917
CAN YOU SEE HER?

17:54.959 --> 17:57.041
UM...

17:57.083 --> 17:59.208
ACTUALLY,
PETE SHOULD SEE HER.
WHAT?

17:59.250 --> 18:00.458
WHAT?

18:00.500 --> 18:02.208
THERE ARE
SOME VERY GOOD STUDIES

18:02.250 --> 18:05.125
ABOUT GUIDED ACTUALIZATION,
AND THAT'S HIS AREA.
THAT'S MY AREA.

18:05.166 --> 18:08.750
YEAH... UH...

18:11.250 --> 18:13.875
WANT SOME CAKE?

18:18.333 --> 18:19.834
MMM.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.917
SWEET MOTHER OF CHOCOLATE.
(laughs)

18:22.959 --> 18:24.458
I KNOW.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.458
YOU REALIZE YOUR REPLACING SEX
WITH FOOD?
YOU WANT SOME?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.041
IT...

18:29.083 --> 18:32.041
COME ON. COME ON.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.834
HOLY... MMM.

18:33.875 --> 18:34.959
MM-HMM.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.458
(Addison) MMM.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.291
(all speaking indistinctly)

18:40.333 --> 18:42.250
(Violet) YOU EAT IT, BABY.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.208
(laughs)

18:49.208 --> 18:52.875
SEE? THEY'RE GETTING HAPPY
OVER CAKE.

18:52.917 --> 18:56.125
I MEAN, IF I COULD
GET HAPPY OVER CAKE...

18:56.166 --> 18:58.125
WELL, I WOULDN'T BE A MAN.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.583
EXACTLY.
SECRET TO WOMEN.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.583
OH, LIKE YOU KNOW
THE SECRET TO WOMEN.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.125
YOU'RE A CHILD.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.125
YOU CAN BARELY GROW
FACIAL HAIR.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.125
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WOMEN YET.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.166
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WANT
AND GIVE IT TO THEM.

19:10.208 --> 19:12.834
YEAH... WELL, THAT'S...

19:12.875 --> 19:14.333
(speaking indistinctly)

19:14.375 --> 19:16.208
YOU BAKED THAT CAKE?

19:16.250 --> 19:19.041
(chuckles) MY GRANDMOTHER
BAKED THAT CAKE.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.375
(chuckles)
BUT NAOMI DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

19:21.417 --> 19:24.375
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WANT
AND GIVE IT TO THEM.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.834
IT WASN'T THE FILLINGS.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.375
IS ERIN OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:27.417 --> 19:30.041
I-I DON'T KNOW.
THEY JUST GOT WORSE.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.417
GET AN EXAM ROOM--

19:31.458 --> 19:34.250
YOU WANT JUST ONE?

19:40.208 --> 19:43.041
YOUR PATIENT
WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX?

19:43.083 --> 19:47.041
MY PATIENT.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
SHE'S CHECKING HER HISTORY
TO SEE IF SHE MIGHT BE ABLE

19:47.083 --> 19:50.000
TO FIND ANYTHING THAT COULD BE
CAUSING THE VAGINISMUS.
DELL.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.417
HE ASKED.
HE SNOOPED.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.417
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TRY MY THING?
YOUR THING?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.417
WHAT, TO CREATIVELY VISUALIZE
THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA,

19:56.458 --> 19:59.250
A GENTLE OPENING OF A FLOWER?

19:59.291 --> 20:01.750
YOU KNOW, ADDISON, THE WAY
WE WORK AROUND HERE IS--

20:01.792 --> 20:03.750
YEAH, I KNOW,
YOU UTILIZE EACH OTHER.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.041
I GOT IT. BUT THIS IS--
WE TAKE IT SLOW.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.250
AND YOUR SOLUTION IS, WHAT,
PUT HER IN SURGERY?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.250
THIS WOMAN IS NOT GONNA DIE
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE SEX.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.250
OH, PLEASE.
IF IT WAS YOU GOING WITHOUT,

20:12.291 --> 20:14.667
YOU'D BE BEGGING
TO GO UNDER THE KNIFE,

20:14.709 --> 20:16.667
MY HIGHLY SKILLED KNIFE.
I KNEW IT WAS TOO MUCH

20:16.709 --> 20:19.250
TO HOPE FOR A DOUBLE
BOARD CERTIFIED SURGEON

20:19.291 --> 20:21.458
NOT TO BE
THE MOST ARROGANT--
ARROGANT?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.709
YOU'VE GOT A GOD
AND A BUDDHA COMPLEX

20:23.750 --> 20:25.709
ALL ROLLED UP
INTO ONE BIG, ARROGANT--

20:25.750 --> 20:28.291
I GOT THIS.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.250
BACK OFF.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.000
(telephone rings)

20:33.041 --> 20:35.458
(sighs) OH, COME ON.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.041
NAOMI IS THIS CLOSE
TO A DIABETIC COMA

20:37.083 --> 20:40.709
THANKS TO YOUR CAKE,
SO YOU'RE WAY WORSE THAN I AM.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.417
OKAY.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.667
DR. TURNER?

20:46.709 --> 20:48.583
KAREN.
STAY OUT OF MY MARRIAGE.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.125
I THINK YOU TOOK CARE
OF THAT.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.333
DOUG CANCELED HIS THERAPY
APPOINTMENT THIS MORNING.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.834
WELL, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT STAYS THAT WAY.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.834
AND IF HE SHOWS UP AGAIN...
(coughs)

20:57.875 --> 20:59.333
(clears throat)

20:59.375 --> 21:02.458
I PAY THE BILLS.
YOU WON'T SEE A DIME.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.458
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DIME,
AND EVEN IF I DID...

21:05.500 --> 21:07.458
W-WHY ARE YOU
FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING

21:07.500 --> 21:09.291
THAT MAKES YOU BOTH
SO MISERABLE?

21:09.333 --> 21:11.291
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MY MARRIAGE MAKES ME FEEL.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM.

21:13.667 --> 21:16.125
YOU ONLY HAVE DOUG'S SIDE
OF THE STORY.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.041
I'M THE BITCH,
AND HE'S--HE'S... (coughs)

21:19.083 --> 21:20.959
I-I AM NOT ON ANYBODY'S--

21:21.000 --> 21:23.041
JUST STAY AWAY FROM--
DID YOU--

21:23.083 --> 21:26.959
(coughing)

21:27.000 --> 21:29.375
(Violet) KAREN! KAREN!
WE NEED SOME HELP!

21:31.083 --> 21:33.291
I HEAR YOU GOT
BLUE GIRLS.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.291
I RAN LABS.
NOTHING'S TURNED UP SO FAR.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.917
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

21:36.959 --> 21:39.750
I GIVE THEM I.V.s, AND THEY
TURN PINK AND SEEM FINE AND...

21:39.792 --> 21:41.750
THEIR MOM INSISTED ON
TAKING THEM HOME.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.750
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
A LOOK AT 'EM?

21:43.792 --> 21:45.291
I ORDERED EXTENSIVE
BLOOD CHROMATOGRAPHS.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.291
WHEN THOSE COME BACK,
YEAH, MAYBE.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.375
THE MOM CHECKED THE HOUSE
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS?

21:49.417 --> 21:51.375
YEAH, I GAVE HER THE FULL LIST

21:51.417 --> 21:54.375
AND SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA
GO OVER IT TOP TO BOTTOM,

21:54.417 --> 21:56.417
WHICH IS GONNA
TAKE A WHILE AND...

21:56.458 --> 21:58.041
THAT'S TIME WE DON'T HAVE.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.458
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING OVER THERE.
I'M GONNA GIVE HER A HAND.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.000
(girls laughing)

22:03.041 --> 22:05.625
(Cooper) THERE'S NOTHING HERE
FROM MY LIST OF CONTAMINANTS,

22:05.667 --> 22:07.542
AND THE GIRLS
WERE NO PLACE ELSE TODAY?

22:07.583 --> 22:09.000
NO FRIEND'S HOUSES? NO--

22:09.041 --> 22:11.000
THEY'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY,
WITH ME.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.542
THIS WAS MY GREAT PLAN.

22:12.583 --> 22:15.125
I QUIT MY JOB, FIRED THE NANNY
BECAUSE I COULD DO IT BETTER.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.917
YOU'VE CHILDPROOFED,
YOU BUY ORGANIC,

22:16.959 --> 22:18.917
YOU HAVE, UH,
BIODEGRADABLE DRYER SHEETS.

22:18.959 --> 22:22.083
I COULD EAT THEM. OKAY?
THIS IS NOT NEGLIGENCE.

22:22.125 --> 22:24.041
YEAH, BUT...

22:24.083 --> 22:25.709
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM,

22:25.750 --> 22:27.709
I--THEIR DAD TRAVELS
ALL THE TIME.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.750
I CAN'T CALL HIM UP AND SAY--
FOR NOW WE JUST NEED TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S DOING THIS

22:30.792 --> 22:32.792
SO THAT THE EXPOSURE DOESN'T
BECOME EVEN MORE DANGEROUS.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.792
BUT WE'VE GONE THROUGH
THE HOUSE TOP TO BOTTOM.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.959
THE YARD, THE GARAGE--
WHAT DID THE GIRLS SAY
ABOUT IT?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.959
WHERE WERE THEY
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED?
THEY DON'T TALK, NOT TO ME,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.041
NOT TO ANYONE OVER 8.
(girl) MOMMY!

22:44.083 --> 22:45.041
ERIN.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.875
MOMMY, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ERIN?

22:47.917 --> 22:49.792
SHE'S HAVING A SEIZURE.

22:49.834 --> 22:52.250
SHE'LL BE OKAY.
SHE'LL BE OKAY.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.792
(Sam) I GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS.

22:54.834 --> 22:57.583
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
CALLED WEGENER'S DISEASE.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.583
IT'S A DISEASE
OF THE BLOOD VESSELS

22:59.625 --> 23:02.792
THAT AFFECTS THE EARS,
NOSE, THROAT AND KIDNEYS.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.583
DOES SHE...

23:05.625 --> 23:07.208
DOES SHE DIE FROM THIS?

23:07.250 --> 23:09.667
WELL, IT TAKES YEARS
TO PROGRESS TO THAT STAGE.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.375
WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT,

23:11.417 --> 23:14.792
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP IT
AT BAY FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU WERE LUCKY.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.792
SOME PEOPLE BLEED OUT INTERNALLY
BEFORE THE DISEASE IS CAUGHT.

23:17.834 --> 23:20.458
LUCKY.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

23:22.083 --> 23:25.000
(monitor beeping)

23:37.583 --> 23:40.041
YOU SHOULD CHANGE.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.041
SAM...

23:41.083 --> 23:43.667
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
IF IT WERE NAOMI?

23:43.709 --> 23:46.917
IF SHE HAD GOTTEN SICK
RIGHT BEFORE THE DIVORCE?

23:46.959 --> 23:48.709
I WOULD'VE STAYED.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.500
VULVAR VESTIBULITIS.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.041
SHISTIKINIATIS.

23:55.083 --> 23:58.041
WHAT? I THOUGHT WE WERE
SAYING WEIRD STUFF.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.917
MY VIRGIN. SHE HAS
VULVAR VESTIBULITIS.

24:00.959 --> 24:03.041
I WENT THROUGH HER ENTIRE
MEDICAL HISTORY.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.542
SHE HAS INFLAMMATION,

24:04.583 --> 24:07.041
PROBABLY CAUSED BY
CHRONIC YEAST INFECTIONS,

24:07.083 --> 24:08.875
WHICH MADE HER NERVE ENDINGS

24:08.917 --> 24:10.875
EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE
TO PAIN,

24:10.917 --> 24:15.041
WHICH IN TURN MADE
ANY ATTEMPT TO HAVE SEX--
OUCH.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.375
THAT KIND OF PAIN IS WHAT
CAUSED HER MUSCLES TO LOCK UP.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.375
SO I'M GONNA DO
TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS

24:19.417 --> 24:21.750
OF LIDOCAINE AND STEROIDS
IN THE SENSITIVE AREAS.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.083
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
SEND HER TO PETE?

24:23.125 --> 24:24.917
NO. I CAN FIX THIS MYSELF.

24:24.959 --> 24:26.125
YOU CAN FIX
THE VULVAR VESTIBULITIS,

24:26.166 --> 24:29.041
BUT PETE CAN FIX
THE VAGINISMUS.
WHAT--

24:29.083 --> 24:31.750
IF YOU WORK TOGETHER WITH HIM,
THE TWO OF YOU WILL BE ABLE

24:31.792 --> 24:33.875
TO GIVE THIS WOMAN
A NORMAL SEX LIFE.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.333
WHY IS EVERYONE
ALWAYS PUSHING PETE ON ME?
WHY ARE YOU PUSHING
SO HARD AGAINST HIM?

24:36.375 --> 24:38.000
WAIT,
YOU WANT TO BELONG HERE,

24:38.041 --> 24:41.041
YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE A PART OF THIS PLACE,

24:41.083 --> 24:44.041
YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT PETE
IS PART OF THE SOLUTION.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.041
WISDOM COMING FROM
A CAKE FIEND.

24:47.083 --> 24:50.041
WELL, I JUST, UM, I JUST
TAKE ALL THESE FEELINGS--

24:50.083 --> 24:54.917
THE, UH, RAGE, THE EXHAUSTION,
THE SEXUAL FRUSTRATION,

24:54.959 --> 24:58.417
THE DESIRE TO RUN SAM DOWN
WITH MY CAR,

24:58.458 --> 25:00.500
THE FACT THAT
MY CHILD NOW THINKS

25:00.542 --> 25:03.000
THAT HER FATHER
IS THE GOOD PARENT--

25:03.041 --> 25:05.000
I JUST TAKE IT ALL
AND I SHOVE IT DOWN

25:05.041 --> 25:06.208
AS FAR AS IT'LL GO,

25:06.250 --> 25:09.041
AND THEN I JUST PUT
SOME FOOD ON TOP OF IT.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.125
MAYBE... YOU SHOULD
TALK TO SAM

25:12.166 --> 25:15.041
INSTEAD OF INHALING
4,000 CALORIES A DAY.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.750
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU FIND
YOUR MAGIC YOUR WAY.

25:17.792 --> 25:19.750
I'LL FIND MY MAGIC MINE.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.000
(clears throat)

25:24.792 --> 25:27.959
VIOLET SAID THAT I SHOULD
CUT PETE SOME SLACK.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.834
MM, THE "WHY"
IS WHAT I'M MISSING.

25:31.875 --> 25:34.208
IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY
OF HIS WIFE'S DEATH.

25:38.083 --> 25:41.041
IS THIS GOING TO HURT?

25:41.083 --> 25:43.000
I'M SORRY. IT IS.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.208
OKAY.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.959
OKAY.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.750
OKAY.

25:47.792 --> 25:50.166
HERE WE GO.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.041
(whimpers)

25:52.083 --> 25:54.625
H-HOW MANY MORE?
FOUR MORE.

25:54.667 --> 25:58.375
FOUR MORE.
I CAN DO FOUR MORE.

25:58.417 --> 26:00.250
OKAY.

26:00.291 --> 26:03.041
(grunts)

26:03.083 --> 26:05.291
I'M OKAY. I CAN DO THIS.

26:05.333 --> 26:08.834
THIS IS GONNA WORK? I MEAN,
SHE'S GOING THROUGH THIS.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.041
IT'S GONNA WORK?

26:10.083 --> 26:13.041
IT WILL SOLVE THE CAUSE
OF THE VAGINISMUS.

26:13.083 --> 26:16.000
AND THEN I'LL GET
MY WEDDING NIGHT?

26:23.959 --> 26:26.333
(Addison) THANKS.
MM-HMM.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.000
THANKS.

26:31.792 --> 26:33.041
(softly) JUST DO IT.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
(normal voice) HEY.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.041
I, UH,
DID A LITTLE RESEARCH,

26:37.083 --> 26:41.333
AND I THINK MY PATIENT
SHOULD TRY YOUR THING.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.041
YOU WANT MY THING?

26:45.083 --> 26:49.041
MY PATIENT. MY PATIENT
NEEDS YOUR THING.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.959
WHAT, NO COMMENTS
ABOUT MY DIRTY TALK?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.959
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NICE TO ME?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.709
I'M NOT. I...

26:56.750 --> 26:59.291
CAN YOU HELP OR NOT?

26:59.333 --> 27:01.583
I HAVE AN OPENING AT 3:00.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.583
SHE'S TOXIC.

27:09.625 --> 27:12.875
TREATMENT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE.

27:12.917 --> 27:17.041
BUT...
SHE'LL PULL THROUGH?

27:17.083 --> 27:20.041
IT WOULD HELP IF WE KNEW
WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH,

27:20.083 --> 27:21.625
THE CONTAMINANT.

27:25.375 --> 27:29.041
GIRLS... THIS IS VERY,
VERY SERIOUS.

27:29.083 --> 27:31.083
DID YOU EAT ANYTHING,

27:31.125 --> 27:34.041
TOUCH ANYTHING
THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO?

27:34.083 --> 27:36.250
MOMMY PROMISES
NOT TO GET MAD.

27:38.083 --> 27:41.250
IT WOULD REALLY HELP ERIN
IF YOU TELL.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.792
(whispering)

27:59.083 --> 28:02.250
SAM.

28:02.291 --> 28:04.250
YOU ORDERED
THESE ANTIBODY STUDIES

28:04.291 --> 28:07.041
FOR KAREN ADAMS,
ROOM 1001?
I DID.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.583
AS CHIEF OF STAFF,
I CAN'T SIGN OFF ON THIS.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.542
THESE STUDIES
ARE OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.542
I HAD TO CONFIRM
A DIAGNOSIS.

28:13.583 --> 28:16.250
AND SINCE WHEN HAS THAT BEEN
AGAINST HOSPITAL POLICY?

28:16.291 --> 28:18.250
SINCE YOUR PATIENT--
THIS KAREN ADAMS--

28:18.291 --> 28:20.041
WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH WEGENER'S DISEASE

28:20.083 --> 28:21.834
AT THIS HOSPITAL
SIX MONTHS AGO.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.041
WAIT, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

28:23.083 --> 28:25.041
SHE JUST STARTED
EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.542
THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD YOU.

28:26.583 --> 28:29.000
THESE RECORDS
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.208
(mutters)

28:35.250 --> 28:36.875
SHE KNEW.

28:36.917 --> 28:39.667
AND SHE NEVER TOLD
HER HUSBAND.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.291
WITH EVERYTHING HE DID
TO YOU, THAT ISN'T--

28:45.333 --> 28:46.834
HEY.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.041
HEY, CHARLOTTE KING
JUST CALLED.

28:48.083 --> 28:50.041
UNNECESSARY TESTS
ON KAREN ADAMS?

28:50.083 --> 28:52.041
I'VE GOT A PATIENT
WHO'S LYING TO ME

28:52.083 --> 28:54.208
ABOUT HER MEDICAL CONDITION.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

28:54.250 --> 28:57.000
IF WE COULD JUST TELL DOUG
THAT KAREN'S BEEN LYING TO HIM,

28:57.041 --> 28:59.709
HE WOULD LEAVE HER.
WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T REVEAL
HER MEDICAL INFORMATION

28:59.750 --> 29:02.041
TO ANYONE, INCLUDING HER
HUSBAND, WITHOUT HER APPROVAL.

29:02.083 --> 29:05.041
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.
SHE'S A PATIENT.
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.875
AND YOUR PATIENT IS MESSING
WITH MY PATIENT'S HAPPINESS.

29:07.917 --> 29:09.875
THREE YEARS OF KICK-ASS THERAPY
DOWN THE DRAIN

29:09.917 --> 29:11.875
WITH ONE SWIFT DIAGNOSIS.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.417
MAYBE THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.

29:13.458 --> 29:17.041
I MEAN,
PEOPLE DO MAKE MARRIAGES WORK.
THEY WON'T MAKE IT WORK.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.041
SHE'LL END UP HATING HIM.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.041
AND HE'LL HATE HIMSELF
FOR STAYING.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.041
AFTER SHE'S GONE,
THAT'S ALL HE'LL HAVE.

29:23.083 --> 29:26.041
SO I THINK IF YOU CAN FIND
A WAY TO HELP YOUR PATIENT,

29:26.083 --> 29:28.041
YOU DO IT.

29:28.083 --> 29:31.500
HEY, THE HOSPITAL SENT OVER
THESE RESULTS ON ERIN MERRING.

29:31.542 --> 29:33.500
I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW THESE GIRLS

29:33.542 --> 29:35.208
ARE GETTING EXPOSED.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.250
I CAN'T EVEN GET THEM
TO TALK TO ME.
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY INTO?

29:38.291 --> 29:41.083
UH, FLUFFY... PINK
PINKNESS?

29:41.125 --> 29:43.083
OKAY, SO GO THERE, TOO.
COMMIT.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.542
GIVE 'EM WHAT THEY WANT.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.083
OH, YOU AND YOUR CAKE.

29:46.125 --> 29:47.542
THEY ARE WOMEN, COOPER.

29:47.583 --> 29:50.041
TINY BLUE WOMEN,
BUT STILL WOMEN.
YEAH, NO.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.792
I DIDN'T GET INTO THIS DEAL
BECAUSE I'M A CLOWN.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.792
WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED TO PLAY
WITH MY PATIENTS?

29:54.834 --> 29:57.041

29:59.750 --> 30:02.041

30:02.083 --> 30:04.125

30:06.709 --> 30:08.125

30:10.959 --> 30:15.208
WHO WANTS TO PLAY?

30:18.083 --> 30:19.333
HI. COME ON IN.

30:19.375 --> 30:22.625

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.583

30:29.625 --> 30:31.208

30:41.041 --> 30:45.333
IT'S JUST, NAOMI TOLD ME
WHAT THIS WEEK IS.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.166
THE ANNIVERSARY.

30:47.208 --> 30:50.000
(scoffs) IT'S NOTHING.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.083
(Cooper) WHERE EXACTLY
ARE WE GOING?
A SECRET PLACE.

30:57.125 --> 30:59.041
OOH, YOU HAVE
A SECRET PLACE?

30:59.083 --> 31:01.041
WE HAVE A MAGIC CASTLE.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.333
BUT FIRST WE GOTTA
GET THROUGH THE FORTRESS.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.834
THE FENCE IS THE FORTRESS.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.250
COME ON.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.333
(girls screaming)

31:09.375 --> 31:11.458
YAH! AAH!

31:11.500 --> 31:13.125
OH.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.375

31:15.417 --> 31:17.834

31:17.875 --> 31:21.291

31:23.709 --> 31:25.208

OOH.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.667
SIT DOWN.

31:26.709 --> 31:28.208
AWESOME CASTLE.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.417
MAGIC CASTLE.
IT MAKES YOU SEE STARS.

31:31.458 --> 31:34.625
SEE?

31:36.333 --> 31:37.792
OH, STARS. YEAH.

31:37.834 --> 31:39.375
WHOA.

31:39.417 --> 31:42.417
(chimes tinkling)

31:44.875 --> 31:46.834
THE STARS MAKE ME DIZZY.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.667
ME, TOO.

31:48.709 --> 31:51.250
ME THREE.

31:51.291 --> 31:55.750
SEE? SEE THE STARS,
HOW THEY GO ALL FUNNY?

31:57.458 --> 31:59.834
THE STARS MAKE YOU DIZZY.

31:59.875 --> 32:03.542
(girls cough)

32:18.291 --> 32:21.041
(Karen) DR. BENNETT.

32:21.083 --> 32:24.417
I TOLD YOU
WE DON'T NEED A THERAPIST.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.041
YOU ARE NOT MY PATIENT.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.375
I AM HERE FOR DOUG.

32:28.417 --> 32:30.917
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU,
KAREN.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.917
NOW I HAVE
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS HERE.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.125
WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO
DISCUSS THEM IN FRONT OF DOUG?

32:35.166 --> 32:38.875
OR WOULD YOU LIKE DOUG
TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH VIOLET?

32:38.917 --> 32:41.375
IT'S UP TO YOU, BECAUSE
AS YOUR DOCTOR, I CANNOT DISCUSS

32:41.417 --> 32:43.709
WHAT'S IN HERE IN FRONT OF HIM
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.583
WHY--WHY WOULD I
HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM?
KAREN?

32:49.083 --> 32:51.041
THIS ISN'T FAIR.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.500
I AM NOT DISCUSSING ANYTHING
WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

32:53.542 --> 32:55.542
EITHER DOUG CAN STAY IN HERE
WITH YOU AND SAM,

32:55.583 --> 32:59.333
OR HE CAN COME OUT IN THE HALL
AND TALK TO ME.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.083
KAREN?

33:04.083 --> 33:06.333
SO I KNEW I WAS SICK BEFORE.
SO WHAT?

33:06.375 --> 33:08.333
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD TAKE IT.

33:08.375 --> 33:11.041
I THOUGHT YOU'D RUN AWAY
LIKE THE WEAKLING YOU ARE,

33:11.083 --> 33:12.542
SO... I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

33:12.583 --> 33:14.750
BUT YOU KNEW YOU WERE SICK
ALL--ALL THIS TIME?

33:14.792 --> 33:17.000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A WEAK,
WHINY PAIN IN THE ASS.

33:17.041 --> 33:19.041
BUT YOU SURPRISED ME.
YOU DIDN'T RUN.

33:19.083 --> 33:21.333
SO IT PROVES
THAT YOU'RE NOT WEAK.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.125
YOU'RE STRONG,
AND I NEED YOU.

33:24.166 --> 33:29.375
I NEED YOUR STRENGTH.
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

33:29.417 --> 33:32.208
WHAT DO YOU WANT, DOUG?

33:32.250 --> 33:35.375
YOU'VE BEEN COMING TO SEE ME
FOR 36 MONTHS--

33:35.417 --> 33:39.041
36 MONTHS AND THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

33:39.083 --> 33:43.208
YOU CAME AND YOU WORKED...

33:43.250 --> 33:45.625
ALL SO YOU COULD SAY
WHAT YOU WANT.

33:45.667 --> 33:49.166
YOU'VE EARNED YOURSELF
A VERY EXPENSIVE BACKBONE.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.625
USE IT.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.583
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:59.083 --> 34:01.667
YOU PROMISED.
I'M TALKING TO DOUG.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.250
(sighs) WHAT I WANT...

34:08.291 --> 34:10.083
(laughs) WHAT I WANT...

34:15.667 --> 34:18.250
I WANT TO STAY.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.375
DOUG, YOU--
I WANT TO STAY.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.500
ALL RIGHT?
END OF DISCUSSION.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.083
I'M STAYING WITH KAREN.

34:25.125 --> 34:28.625
I'M STAYING WITH MY WIFE.

34:35.834 --> 34:36.875
(Cathleen)
GOOD-BYE. THANKS.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.500
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.
TAKE CARE.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.041
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH--

34:41.083 --> 34:43.041
DON'T SAY ANYTHING NICE
TO ME.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.709
I WASN'T.
YOU WERE.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.041
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY.
I DON'T NEED YOUR SYMPATHY.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.208
I WAS GOING TO SAY,

34:49.250 --> 34:52.875
WHATEVER YOU DID IN THERE
FOR CATHLEEN, I HOPE IT WORKS.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.333
THEY DESERVE TO HAVE
A PERFECT NIGHT.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.667
OH.

34:57.709 --> 35:00.041
I GET A LITTLE...

35:00.083 --> 35:02.041
I NEED...

35:02.083 --> 35:04.000
I-I...

35:05.125 --> 35:08.000
I'M A LITTLE LOST HERE.

35:10.959 --> 35:13.500
MY WIFE WENT TO SLEEP
BESIDE ME IN BED

35:13.542 --> 35:14.959
ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.750
ON WEDNESDAY MORNING,
I WOKE UP, AND SHE WAS DEAD.

35:17.792 --> 35:20.959
ONE BAD NIGHT, BUT...

35:25.083 --> 35:28.041
ALL OUR NIGHTS WERE BAD.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.709
AND WE NEVER HAD
A PERFECT NIGHT...

35:32.542 --> 35:35.000
NOT EVEN OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.166
NOTHING'S PERFECT.

35:40.083 --> 35:42.125
NOTHING'S EVER PERFECT.

35:51.083 --> 35:53.041
THAT'S THE MOST
HE'S EVER TOLD ANYBODY

35:53.083 --> 35:55.000
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

36:03.083 --> 36:06.125
THE, UH, CASTLE
IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S YARD

36:06.166 --> 36:08.583
IS FULL OF TOXIC FUMES

36:08.625 --> 36:10.208
FROM OPEN BAGS OF FERTILIZER.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.000
THAT'S WHAT MADE THEM SICK?

36:12.041 --> 36:14.333
YEAH, THEY WERE INHALING
AMMONIUM NITRATE.

36:14.375 --> 36:16.041
FIRST IT TURNED 'EM BLUE,

36:16.083 --> 36:18.041
THEN IT ATTACKED
THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS.

36:18.083 --> 36:20.041
(sighs)
THEY PLAY IN THE YARD.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.834
I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D GET
BEYOND THE FENCE.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY KINDA KICK ASS SO...

36:25.083 --> 36:27.125
MOM.

36:27.166 --> 36:30.083
CAN THEY SIT IN MY BED?

36:30.125 --> 36:34.000
BE GENTLE. OKAY?

36:42.250 --> 36:45.000

36:54.208 --> 36:56.041
I'M SORRY.

36:56.083 --> 36:59.291
I-I KNOW HOW MUCH...
YOU CARED,

36:59.333 --> 37:01.667
HOW HARD YOU WORKED.

37:01.709 --> 37:04.208
YOU WORKED.
YOU DID MOST OF IT.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.208
I-I MAY NOT BE IN LOVE
WITH HER,

37:06.250 --> 37:09.000
BUT... I OWE HER.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.834
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH
WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH ALONE.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.041
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE--

37:13.083 --> 37:14.917
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

37:14.959 --> 37:17.208
I-I STILL THINK
WE DID SOMETHING HERE.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.583
I MEAN, BEFORE I MET YOU,
THINGS JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.417
I MADE A CHOICE TODAY.

37:21.458 --> 37:25.041
BUT YOU'RE STILL PICKING
WHAT'S SAFE, WHAT'S FAMILIAR,

37:25.083 --> 37:28.041
PAIN THAT WON'T EVEN
MAKE HER BETTER.

37:28.083 --> 37:30.875
WHAT ABOUT--
WHAT I WANT...

37:30.917 --> 37:34.041
IS FOR YOU TO BE THE THERAPIST
AND ME TO BE THE PATIENT.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.291
IT'S MY LIFE.

37:35.333 --> 37:38.125
AT LEAST NOW I KNOW
I'VE MADE MY BED.

37:38.166 --> 37:40.125
NOBODY ELSE.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.041
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.041
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.709
AND YOU MADE IT.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.125
AND THAT IS SOMETHING.

37:52.166 --> 37:54.166
THANKS.

38:07.083 --> 38:09.959

38:10.000 --> 38:12.125

38:13.625 --> 38:17.041

38:17.083 --> 38:19.917

ENOUGH WITH THE CAKE.

38:44.375 --> 38:47.083
I DON'T WANT YOUR CAKE.
I DON'T NEED YOUR CAKE.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.750
I-I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR CAKE.
I'M ALL CAKED OUT.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.792
YOU KNOW WHOSE CAKE I WANT?
I WANT SAM'S CAKE.

38:51.834 --> 38:55.083
I WANT SAM'S CAKE,
BUT SAM'S NOT BAKING A CAKE.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.834

SO COULD YOU JUST--
NAI.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.208

39:01.250 --> 39:03.333
