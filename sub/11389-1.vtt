03:13.264 --> 03:16.517
(speaking French)

03:40.291 --> 03:42.335
(speaking French)

04:42.520 --> 04:44.772
Taking your number, fella. I got it.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.609
That's in case you screwed me.

05:30.276 --> 05:31.777
- Bartlemy!
- Pardon?

05:31.903 --> 05:33.738
Bart...

05:35.406 --> 05:37.450
Bartlemy.

05:39.911 --> 05:41.954
Ah.

05:56.969 --> 05:59.180
- Bartlemy.
- Hm?

05:59.305 --> 06:01.557
- Bartlemy.
- Barthélémy?

06:01.682 --> 06:04.769
- Bartlemy. Yeah.
- (French)

06:04.894 --> 06:07.355
- Which one?
- (French)

06:08.523 --> 06:10.358
Barthélémy.

06:25.540 --> 06:28.209
(French)

06:29.377 --> 06:31.003
Bartlemy?

06:31.337 --> 06:33.172
Bartlemy.

06:36.551 --> 06:38.594
I'm Doyle.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.598
Ah. Doyle. Henri Barthélémy.

06:43.015 --> 06:45.685
- Bartlemy.
- We were expecting you.

06:45.810 --> 06:48.187
- A little spare-time work?
- Narcotics.

06:49.313 --> 06:51.190
- In the fish?
- In the fish.

06:51.315 --> 06:54.819
Unfortunately this is our information,
Monsieur Doyle.

06:54.944 --> 06:59.407
(French)

07:02.326 --> 07:07.915
Oh, pardon me. Inspectors Diron and Miletto.
Monsieur Doyle de New York.

07:11.586 --> 07:13.671
- We shall work together.
- Great.

07:13.796 --> 07:14.922
Henri!

07:15.047 --> 07:17.091
(French)

07:29.228 --> 07:31.272
(French)

07:47.622 --> 07:50.458
- What's all this about?
- Poisson d'avril.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.044
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:54.003 --> 07:56.088
April Fools' Day.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.674
You know? We are the first of April.

07:59.258 --> 08:01.761
You see, this information was a bad joke.

08:02.720 --> 08:08.935
Over here, on April Fools' Day, it's a custom
to pin a fish on people. You know?

08:09.060 --> 08:11.729
Only it's usually a paper one.

08:12.897 --> 08:15.274
They really pinned it to you this time.

08:15.483 --> 08:17.527
This way, please.

08:30.456 --> 08:33.668
"Doyle, James R."

08:36.003 --> 08:38.130
(French)

08:47.640 --> 08:51.978
"42 years old. Nickname: Popeye."

08:58.442 --> 09:00.278
Cute.

09:01.863 --> 09:03.906
Spinach.

09:05.408 --> 09:08.786
What are you doin' with my file
in the shithouse, huh?

09:08.911 --> 09:11.330
This another one of your April Fool jokes?

09:11.455 --> 09:13.791
No. I like reading it here.

09:15.751 --> 09:17.795
Uh...

09:17.962 --> 09:21.591
60 kilos of heroin. It was a big arrest.

09:22.675 --> 09:26.512
Regarde, Miletto.
We have an authentic American hero here.

09:28.598 --> 09:30.850
Where the fuck did you get that?

09:30.975 --> 09:33.686
Mr. Doyle, I was requested to help you.

09:33.978 --> 09:36.564
I didn't request that you come here.

09:36.689 --> 09:41.319
But naturally I wanted to know
who you were. I found out.

09:41.527 --> 09:44.113
After this big arrest,...

09:44.238 --> 09:46.407
..it disappeared.

09:46.532 --> 09:51.537
I read in the papers that somebody stole your
heroin right out of the police headquarters.

09:52.955 --> 09:54.999
Was it your friends?

09:57.126 --> 09:59.795
My friends are still on the force.

09:59.879 --> 10:02.548
How many men have you killed?

10:02.673 --> 10:05.051
Wait a fuckin' minute. Wait a minute!

10:06.385 --> 10:08.304
Am I bein' interrogated here?

10:08.429 --> 10:12.183
Am I workin' with you, or am l
some kind of goddamn suspect, or what?

10:17.730 --> 10:19.899
Five.

10:20.024 --> 10:22.276
Five people killed.

10:23.444 --> 10:25.404
It seems quite a lot.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.833
I've been a New York cop for 14 years.

10:38.251 --> 10:43.256
I know that the dope that comes out of
this city has killed a lot more than I have.

10:49.095 --> 10:51.764
Two of the dead were policemen.

10:53.599 --> 10:55.434
Right?

10:56.352 --> 10:58.396
Miletto, show him his office.

11:08.781 --> 11:10.408
Mr. Doyle.

11:10.533 --> 11:13.411
This is, uh... your office.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.414
Right here.

11:22.003 --> 11:24.672
- Yeah.
- (toilet flushes)

11:25.298 --> 11:28.134
Right next to the, uh... the shithouse, huh?

11:28.259 --> 11:31.637
I got a telephone, an extension... It's terrific.

11:32.305 --> 11:33.931
Very nice.

11:34.056 --> 11:39.520
Hey, Henry. It's beautiful. Really beautiful.
I'd be better off in New York on welfare.

11:39.645 --> 11:42.607
Hey, poor Popeye. You are -
how do you say - homesick?

11:42.732 --> 11:44.734
I'll send for some spinach.

11:44.859 --> 11:48.738
Hey, Bartlemy, why don't you
knock off the chickenshit, huh?

11:48.863 --> 11:52.200
I'd rather be a lamppost in New York
than the president of France.

11:52.325 --> 11:56.537
I came over for one thing only: to get
Charnier. And that's what I'm gonna do.

11:56.662 --> 12:00.374
I'm gonna get him and put him
where he belongs, even if you won't.

12:00.500 --> 12:04.420
Hey, bravo. It's D-day in Marseilles.
The Americans have landed.

12:04.545 --> 12:07.298
- (French)
- (phone)

12:08.382 --> 12:10.426
(French)

12:15.014 --> 12:20.645
Hey, this Charnier of yours,
to begin with, this is certainly not his name.

12:20.770 --> 12:25.691
Second, there is no record of such a man -
here, in Paris, or in the streets.

12:25.816 --> 12:28.819
But there is more of a record on you,
and it's not very nice.

12:28.945 --> 12:31.948
I must remind you,
it's you that let him escape.

12:33.115 --> 12:38.287
Come, back to work. But you come
only with us to observe, hein?

12:40.289 --> 12:42.625
You carry no gun, I hope.

12:42.750 --> 12:48.798
- It's illegal for foreigners. Even policemen.
- No, no gun. I'm strictly by the book.

12:48.923 --> 12:52.468
- You read my file, right?
- That's why I asked.

14:11.214 --> 14:13.132
- Raoul?
- Oui, Henri.

14:13.257 --> 14:14.800
- Miletto?
- Oui.

14:14.926 --> 14:16.677
- Prets?
- Prets.

14:16.802 --> 14:17.929
OK.

14:18.054 --> 14:20.097
Doyle.

14:20.806 --> 14:23.351
You just stay close to me and observe.

14:23.476 --> 14:28.022
You are my guest.
You do nothing, say nothing. OK?

14:28.147 --> 14:31.526
Who, me? I'm naked, remember?

14:31.651 --> 14:37.156
You must think I'm some sort of hero.
No, I'm just here to watch how the pros do it.

14:37.281 --> 14:39.325
I'm your guest.

14:40.117 --> 14:42.328
On y va.

14:45.456 --> 14:48.209
(loudhailer) Ici la police!

14:48.918 --> 14:51.671
(French)

15:16.404 --> 15:18.364
(French)

15:22.577 --> 15:24.829
(screaming)

15:30.168 --> 15:31.169
Hey!

15:34.672 --> 15:36.174
Hey!

15:38.801 --> 15:41.137
Doyle! Doyle!

15:42.889 --> 15:44.807
Doyle, come back! Doyle!

15:45.683 --> 15:47.727
Doyle! Raoul!

16:09.707 --> 16:11.751
(car horns)

16:50.248 --> 16:52.500
(Doyle) You bastard!

16:54.252 --> 16:56.170
Get him off me, goddamnit!

17:09.183 --> 17:11.477
(French)

17:11.602 --> 17:15.146
I want him arrested!
You're under arrest, you son of a bitch!

17:15.272 --> 17:19.193
Shut up! You've got
no police powers here, Doyle!

17:23.030 --> 17:25.700
Forget it. Raoul!

17:25.782 --> 17:29.787
- Come on. Come on, Doyle.
- No! I want that bastard collared!

17:30.413 --> 17:32.039
- You let him go?
- He's ours.

17:32.165 --> 17:33.499
- What?
- He's ours!

17:33.624 --> 17:36.169
How do you think he got out of there?
Come on.

17:36.294 --> 17:38.337
(dog barks)

17:39.213 --> 17:41.257
Holy shit.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.763
(mutters)

17:48.306 --> 17:51.142
(siren)

17:59.942 --> 18:01.986
(Barthélémy shouts in French)

18:13.539 --> 18:17.627
Why don't you go back to New York and
kill policemen? That's what you do best.

18:17.752 --> 18:19.754
Raoul, tu appelles l'ambulance.

18:20.213 --> 18:24.675
Two months' infiltration
wasted through your madness.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.178
- If you'd warned me, he'd still be alive.
- No!

18:27.303 --> 18:30.848
If you'd done what I told you,
he would still be alive.

18:40.942 --> 18:43.402
(French)

18:45.446 --> 18:48.324
Hey, what'd he say? What'd he say?

18:49.742 --> 18:53.412
Look at all this stuff.
Must've been an accident, huh?

18:54.330 --> 18:58.668
Look at that acid. Must be enough there
for 50 kilos. Maybe double that.

18:59.627 --> 19:02.839
You hit him too soon. Hey, you screwed up.

19:02.964 --> 19:04.757
I have a job for you, Doyle.

19:04.882 --> 19:08.344
You want to know what people say?
You talk to them!

19:09.011 --> 19:12.723
What do you mean?
Hey, you mean interrogate 'em?

19:13.391 --> 19:17.728
What am I supposed to use - sign language?
I don't speak French, remember?

19:17.854 --> 19:21.399
Miletto will be your interpreter. Miletto!

19:21.524 --> 19:25.778
- Hey. Shove it.
- No, my friend. You shove it!

19:26.612 --> 19:30.116
You don't help us outside. You just fuck up.

19:31.325 --> 19:36.873
What do you know of Marseilles? You think
it's Harlem? Kicking blacks in the streets?

19:37.582 --> 19:42.712
Get depositions from all of them. I don't give
a damn what they say, but I want it in writing.

19:42.837 --> 19:46.048
Hey, look. I came over here
to nail that Frog son of a bitch good.

19:46.174 --> 19:52.138
It's not part of my plan to sit beatin' my meat
while you French narcs grab all the credit.

19:52.263 --> 19:56.559
You stick me next to the shithouse
while you take all the medals, right?

19:56.684 --> 19:59.478
That's right.

20:03.983 --> 20:06.027
(siren)

22:08.191 --> 22:11.402
We should decide
the matter of the rendezvous.

22:11.527 --> 22:14.906
A place to meet after
you have made the delivery.

22:15.031 --> 22:17.074
How's New York?

22:18.326 --> 22:24.332
You know better than that, William.
New York is hazardous to your health.

22:24.999 --> 22:27.251
At least, to my health.

22:28.419 --> 22:30.671
But it is an amusing city.

22:31.506 --> 22:35.218
(shouts in French)

22:35.635 --> 22:41.599
- How did you do it, if it's not a secret?
- Oh, it was very simple, and very droll.

22:41.724 --> 22:44.727
83 policemen wanted to talk to me,...

22:44.852 --> 22:48.189
..and 52 of them chose
to talk to my money instead.

22:49.273 --> 22:52.860
I love a city where you always
know where you stand.

23:03.955 --> 23:05.331
(Doyle whistles)

23:05.456 --> 23:08.960
Hey, Hank!
I'm really learnin' a lot up here.

23:09.961 --> 23:12.004
You're really missin' it, buddy.

23:12.547 --> 23:18.302
(policeman) This one's named Godardi.
We arrest for drugs. One conviction.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.979
I'm gonna take you right down there
in that alley. Right down there.

23:28.104 --> 23:30.857
And we'll start on your throat, right here.

23:31.858 --> 23:34.068
I'm gonna bust everything in it.

23:35.486 --> 23:39.156
You like that, huh? Then your belly.
I'll start workin' on your belly.

23:39.282 --> 23:42.743
I'm gonna hit you so fuckin' hard,
it'll break your backbone.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.912
- Je comprends pas.
- You compris that?

23:45.037 --> 23:47.707
- Non.
- No, you don't understand, huh?

23:47.790 --> 23:51.002
Then I'm gonna work on your arms.
I'm gonna set 'em over a kerb.

23:51.127 --> 23:54.046
I'm gonna use 'em for a trampoline,
jump up and down on 'em.

23:54.172 --> 23:57.008
And then your kneecaps. One, two. Kneecaps.

23:57.133 --> 23:59.802
I'll make oatmeal
out of your fuckin' kneecaps.

23:59.927 --> 24:04.223
And when I get done with you,
you are gonna put me right in Charnier's lap.

24:04.348 --> 24:07.226
- Je ne le connais pas.
- You connais pas?

24:07.351 --> 24:09.395
Ah, food.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.652
What'd you do - cremate the fuckin' thing?

24:16.777 --> 24:18.821
You cremated it. You burned...

24:18.946 --> 24:22.200
You got the ketchup there.
Where's the mayo? The mayonnaise.

24:22.325 --> 24:25.411
Mayonnaise. Mayo, mayo, mayo, mayo.

24:25.536 --> 24:27.705
- Watch my mouth: mayo.
- Mayo.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.917
Mayo, right. And relish. Relish.

24:31.501 --> 24:32.835
- Relish.
- Relish.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.338
Relish, right. Mayo and relish.

24:36.255 --> 24:38.299
- Send Miletto up too, will you?
- Hein?

24:38.424 --> 24:40.468
- Miletto!
- Yes, yes. Miletto.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.138
That's good, huh?

24:44.263 --> 24:46.641
Hey, Miletto! Come on, get up here!

24:46.766 --> 24:49.352
I want ya to ask this fuck somethin'.

24:50.353 --> 24:53.648
Ask him if he ever
picked his feet in Poughkeepsie.

24:53.773 --> 24:56.984
- Is this comfortable for you?
- I didn't understand.

24:57.109 --> 25:01.072
Ask him... You ever
pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.283
(French)

25:08.329 --> 25:11.082
- I'm gonna take a walk.
- Doyle, the orders.

25:12.291 --> 25:14.335
Stick your orders right here.

25:16.045 --> 25:18.089
(thunder)

25:31.435 --> 25:35.523
I'd like a... Four Roses,
straight up, and water on the side.

25:35.648 --> 25:37.692
Quoi?

25:38.150 --> 25:41.362
Four Roses, straight up,
and water on the side.

25:41.487 --> 25:44.490
- Comprends pas.
- Aw, shit. Uh...

25:45.950 --> 25:47.577
Bourbon.

25:49.912 --> 25:52.415
(French accent) Bourbon. Bourbon.

25:55.251 --> 25:58.254
(Doyle sighs) OK. Um...

26:00.256 --> 26:02.925
Can you give me some help here?

26:05.887 --> 26:07.638
Uh... Jack Daniels.

26:07.763 --> 26:10.808
- Jack qui?
- Jackie, yeah. Jackie Daniels.

26:12.393 --> 26:14.437
Jackie?

26:15.271 --> 26:17.315
Let's see. Um...

26:18.733 --> 26:21.402
Scotch. Right there.

26:21.611 --> 26:24.280
- El Scotcho.
- Whisky?

26:24.405 --> 26:27.492
- Avec glace?
- In a glass, yeah.

26:40.588 --> 26:43.174
No, I don't want ice. I don't want it.

26:47.970 --> 26:51.057
Uh, excuse me, miss. Excuse me, ladies.

26:51.182 --> 26:53.434
Can I offer you a little drink?

26:54.560 --> 26:58.356
- A drink. Would you like a drink?
- (French)

26:58.481 --> 27:00.525
Comprends pas.

27:01.275 --> 27:04.737
- Mind if I sit down?
- (French)

27:04.862 --> 27:07.073
- What?
- (French)

27:07.198 --> 27:10.284
I don't understand. Just have a little drink.

27:14.163 --> 27:16.207
OK.

27:29.595 --> 27:32.306
How'd you like to kiss my Irish ass, huh?

27:33.641 --> 27:36.853
- Guess that told 'em, huh?
- (motorbikes zoom off)

27:37.144 --> 27:39.188
Hey, fella?

27:40.565 --> 27:44.819
How about another drink here?
Give me about two fingers, like that.

27:44.944 --> 27:46.988
- Un autre?
- Yeah. Um...

27:48.364 --> 27:50.533
Give yourself one too.

27:51.159 --> 27:53.202
- Pour moi?
- What's your name?

27:53.744 --> 27:55.788
André.

27:56.289 --> 28:00.209
Help yourself to one. I want...
Somebody's gonna have a drink with me.

28:00.334 --> 28:02.712
- Um... you.
- Moi?

28:02.837 --> 28:04.881
Right. Give yourself a drink.

28:06.424 --> 28:09.302
Á boire, pour moi? Merci beaucoup.

28:16.934 --> 28:19.228
You're gonna drink that green shit?

28:20.188 --> 28:21.939
J'aime beaucoup ça.

28:22.064 --> 28:25.109
- That's not... Hey, come on. Fill it up.
- Merci beaucoup.

28:25.234 --> 28:27.361
- Have a drink.
- Un double, alors.

28:33.242 --> 28:35.286
(low voices)

28:41.167 --> 28:42.960
- Pretty good drinker.
- Double?

28:43.085 --> 28:45.129
Double.

28:48.257 --> 28:51.677
- I hope those Hell's Angels come back.
- Mais c'est de ma part. Moi.

28:51.802 --> 28:53.554
Have another drink.

28:53.679 --> 28:56.140
No, no, no. Have another - you.

29:06.317 --> 29:08.361
- Santé.
- Down the hatch.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.825
Throw it back.

29:14.617 --> 29:16.327
Ah!

29:16.452 --> 29:18.704
(French)

29:18.830 --> 29:21.207
- Merci.
- I'll have another.

29:23.376 --> 29:25.419
(drunken laughter)

29:27.463 --> 29:31.175
# The first marines bought the beans

29:31.300 --> 29:33.344
# Parley-voo

29:34.011 --> 29:37.139
# The first marines bought the beans

29:37.265 --> 29:39.308
# Parley-voo

29:39.851 --> 29:43.938
# Oh... the first marines, the second marines...

29:49.360 --> 29:51.404
- # The first marines
- (drunken mumbling)

29:51.529 --> 29:52.530
No, no.

29:52.655 --> 29:56.993
- # The first marines
- # Ze first marines

29:57.118 --> 30:00.121
- # Bought the beans
- # Botza beans?

30:00.246 --> 30:02.290
Bought the beans!

30:02.415 --> 30:04.750
Yeah. Gimme my hat back.

30:05.376 --> 30:06.878
Ah!

30:07.003 --> 30:11.257
# Two marines are following me
Parley-voo

30:11.382 --> 30:13.426
Par... Parlez-vous?

30:13.551 --> 30:17.471
# Two marines are following me
Parley-voo

30:17.597 --> 30:19.640
# Parlez-vous

30:20.391 --> 30:24.645
# Two marines are following me,
I don't think they're gonna catch me

30:27.857 --> 30:29.692
(phone)

30:34.739 --> 30:36.782
Oui?

30:36.908 --> 30:38.951
Hello. Inspector?

30:39.368 --> 30:41.412
Yes. How are you?

30:42.497 --> 30:45.583
Well, it's... sunny, warm.

30:47.168 --> 30:49.629
Yes. There too? Formidable.

30:51.631 --> 30:54.300
Well, the plan is going as you said it would.

30:55.593 --> 31:00.848
(Barthélémy) No, I don't like it, no.
If Charnier is in Marseilles and sees him,...

31:00.973 --> 31:03.017
..it will be very dangerous.

31:04.602 --> 31:10.191
Well, I have two men on Doyle, day and night.
But he is unpredictable.

31:11.025 --> 31:13.861
No, I would not do it this way.

31:14.403 --> 31:20.618
First I would tell Doyle myself that he is
being used as - how do you say - as bait.

31:21.494 --> 31:24.580
Well, he is your man, not mine, Inspector.

31:26.916 --> 31:30.294
Oh, yes. He is very evident, very visible, yes.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.257
Hello? Hello? Merde. On a été coupé.

31:34.715 --> 31:37.176
Hello? Hello?

31:38.135 --> 31:40.596
Yes, operator? We were cut off.

31:41.264 --> 31:44.058
I was talking to
the New York Police Department.

31:44.559 --> 31:46.227
Hello?

31:46.352 --> 31:49.647
What do you mean,
it's the French operator's fault?

31:50.106 --> 31:52.650
What? Hello? Hello.

31:52.775 --> 31:55.152
Hello! Merde.

31:55.444 --> 31:57.488
(news in French)

32:06.956 --> 32:09.000
(car horns)

32:14.839 --> 32:16.883
(siren)

32:24.307 --> 32:28.728
- I wanna go right there, not here.
- (French)

32:30.229 --> 32:32.273
Do you speak English?

32:34.567 --> 32:36.611
Speak English?

32:40.656 --> 32:42.325
(car horn)

32:42.450 --> 32:44.494
Hey!

32:47.330 --> 32:49.373
Hey, Henry?

32:49.957 --> 32:51.876
Pretty good.

32:52.001 --> 32:56.422
You had a two-hour lunch?
Are you investigating the greasy spoons?

32:56.881 --> 32:58.925
Doyle, this is Mademoiselle Lefévre.

32:59.050 --> 33:02.678
- Monique, Monsieur Doyle de New York.
- Bonjour.

33:02.803 --> 33:06.724
- I thought that you had left us.
- No, I was... hangin' around.

33:06.849 --> 33:11.103
I wanted to find out why Charnier
likes this burg so much. You know?

33:11.604 --> 33:13.689
- I think I found out.
- Found out what?

33:13.981 --> 33:19.445
That while Charnier is walking around free,
the police are having two-hour lunches.

33:19.862 --> 33:24.033
- Can I get you a taxi to the airport?
- No, I think I'll just stay here.

33:24.158 --> 33:26.202
- As you wish.
- Listen.

33:26.327 --> 33:28.996
I want you to do me a favour.

33:29.121 --> 33:31.958
Get your two tails off my back, will you?

33:32.083 --> 33:34.252
Is the tall one your brother-in-law?

33:34.377 --> 33:37.338
- Listen, Doyle...
- No, you listen!

33:37.463 --> 33:41.008
I came over to get that fuckin' Charnier,
and I'm gonna get his ass.

33:41.133 --> 33:44.929
And I could do it a lot better
if Sacco and Vanzetti were off my tail.

33:45.054 --> 33:47.431
Put 'em back on the school crossing.

33:47.557 --> 33:51.602
They might get run over by a bicycle.
I don't want that on my conscience.

33:51.727 --> 33:55.189
- Nice to have met you.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit?

34:31.893 --> 34:34.020
You want this ball? Huh?

34:34.228 --> 34:36.272
Come on. Come over and get it.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.749
God, I wish this Blanc de Blancs
would travel.

35:36.874 --> 35:39.585
I'd like to take 20 cases back to Washington.

35:39.710 --> 35:42.672
All you Americans have that misconception.

35:42.797 --> 35:46.717
Wine will travel.
It is people who have difficulty.

35:52.682 --> 35:55.935
They understood about
you not travelling with the shipment.

35:56.060 --> 36:01.274
Good. I'm pleased you all continue
to see the situation as I do.

36:19.292 --> 36:21.419
Bill,...

36:21.544 --> 36:24.922
..have Geneva taken the necessary first step?

36:26.215 --> 36:31.637
Exactly as you wanted it, with a good spread
against inflation and floating currencies.

36:31.762 --> 36:36.601
100,000 in South African rands,
50 in Canadian dollars, another 50 in yen.

36:36.726 --> 36:40.062
200,000 altogether.
Ten per cent, as per the agreement.

36:43.107 --> 36:46.777
OK. Tell them the final shipment is en route.

36:47.653 --> 36:52.200
- Once it arrives, we cook for a few days.
- Understood.

36:54.076 --> 36:58.664
We are expecting you for dinner.
A little party, very informal.

36:59.874 --> 37:02.960
I'd love to but... no can do.

37:05.922 --> 37:07.965
Official business.

37:08.090 --> 37:10.968
Looks like you guys want us back here again.

37:11.093 --> 37:15.890
I've gotta be in Paris to have dinner with the
Minister of Defence, talk numbers and bases.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.186
Thank you very much for the lunch, Alain.

37:20.853 --> 37:23.523
Incidentally, Geneva's counting on you.

37:24.815 --> 37:27.735
Sorry. They wanted it made clear.

37:27.860 --> 37:29.987
Naturally.

37:30.112 --> 37:34.951
My expectations of them are the same.
Be sure they know that too.

37:41.165 --> 37:43.209
(French)

38:04.355 --> 38:07.984
Bonjour, mon chéri.
Je ne suis pas trop en retard?

38:08.109 --> 38:10.153
Non, non. Pas du tout.

38:10.611 --> 38:13.281
Mais... excuse-moi. Je suis obligé de partir.

38:19.245 --> 38:20.746
Listen, um...

38:20.872 --> 38:24.625
You play good volleyball.
You bounce around a lot.

38:26.043 --> 38:28.629
I'll see you down at the beach, huh?

39:33.736 --> 39:35.404
Sacco and Vanz...

40:54.233 --> 40:56.611
(shouts in French)

41:13.920 --> 41:16.380
(footsteps)

41:33.648 --> 41:38.986
I must say, Mr. Doyle, that you were
the one person I did not want to see again.

41:39.070 --> 41:42.156
(French)

41:43.032 --> 41:49.080
My... associates here want to discuss things
with you, Doyle, but in their fashion.

41:50.790 --> 41:56.254
I told them it would be useless,
that you would die first.

41:57.588 --> 42:02.802
And, of course, then we would never find out
what you have learned about our...

42:03.594 --> 42:05.346
..little business.

42:07.974 --> 42:10.852
That was the expensive lesson of New York.

42:11.853 --> 42:14.105
You're a good cop.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.899
Honest, but stupid.

42:18.484 --> 42:20.736
But honest.

42:21.195 --> 42:23.865
Up your ass, Charnier.

42:42.508 --> 42:44.552
I'll tell you what I found out.

42:47.180 --> 42:50.808
I found out that you eat shit,
you fuckin' Frog, you!

42:51.475 --> 42:55.855
- (Charnier) That's not good enough.
- You goddamn scumbag, you!

45:19.540 --> 45:21.584
(thunder and rain)

46:04.502 --> 46:06.546
(door opens gently)

46:15.054 --> 46:17.098
Hello.

46:18.891 --> 46:22.395
I have a son just about your age.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.564
Nice young man.

46:25.940 --> 46:30.319
I'm English, you know.
I heard you speak English.

46:30.778 --> 46:32.864
I heard you shout.

46:32.989 --> 46:35.116
You mustn't shout.

46:36.159 --> 46:38.536
They never listen.

46:39.829 --> 46:44.125
I have lived in Marseilles for 42 years.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.294
Even through the war.

46:47.044 --> 46:49.380
I married a Frenchman.

46:50.673 --> 46:52.925
He wouldn't listen to me.

46:55.052 --> 46:58.556
And then my son went away.

46:59.932 --> 47:03.019
Nobody listens to me.

47:04.312 --> 47:06.355
No, no, no, no, no, no.

47:06.731 --> 47:10.401
You mustn't do that. You mustn't scratch.

47:11.277 --> 47:15.990
You'll get infected,
and then you'll be very sick.

47:16.115 --> 47:18.159
You must...

47:18.284 --> 47:20.328
Like that. See?

47:21.829 --> 47:23.873
Hm? (chuckles)

47:39.764 --> 47:42.433
When will they come around again?

47:44.352 --> 47:46.187
Soon.

47:46.562 --> 47:48.022
Soon.

47:48.815 --> 47:50.858
But you mustn't shout.

47:51.818 --> 47:53.861
No one will listen.

47:59.408 --> 48:02.495
(woman laughs deliriously outside)

48:16.759 --> 48:18.803
(toilet flushes)

48:20.054 --> 48:22.098
(banging)

48:24.267 --> 48:27.353
- (singing French song)
- (Doyle hums along)

48:39.949 --> 48:43.286
Ah! Voilá. There you are.

48:44.453 --> 48:46.497
(police siren)

48:47.957 --> 48:50.001
(hums dreamily)

50:07.286 --> 50:09.539
Not yet.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.044
Doyle,...

50:16.254 --> 50:18.381
..tell me.

50:28.349 --> 50:32.687
They sent me over here because I was
the only one who could recognise you.

50:36.107 --> 50:38.151
That's all.

50:39.110 --> 50:41.154
I didn't find out anything.

50:45.116 --> 50:47.702
(sighs) You fuckhead, you.

50:51.747 --> 50:55.376
This ain't my town. I can't even
get a goddamn drink here.

50:55.501 --> 50:57.545
Come on.

50:58.462 --> 51:00.506
Come on!

51:01.048 --> 51:03.092
You know,...

51:04.093 --> 51:06.470
..I believe you.

51:10.766 --> 51:12.810
(gives order in French)

51:37.210 --> 51:39.253
(Doyle mutters)

52:09.325 --> 52:14.413
We'll take you back, Doyle, to your friends.
They are looking for you everywhere,...

52:15.248 --> 52:17.750
..and making it difficult for me to operate.

52:18.543 --> 52:20.795
So we are giving you back to them.

52:53.870 --> 52:57.206
- C'est l'américain.
- Oui, c'est l'américain!

52:57.331 --> 52:59.375
Appelle Henri.

53:03.045 --> 53:04.463
Barthélémy!

53:04.589 --> 53:07.008
Henri, viens vite.

53:07.133 --> 53:09.177
Oui.

53:39.707 --> 53:42.585
(doctor gives instructions in French)

55:07.044 --> 55:08.838
(Doyle groans)

55:30.193 --> 55:32.236
(machinery gurgles)

55:48.294 --> 55:50.338
(French)

55:53.966 --> 55:56.010
(heart monitor beeps)

56:18.324 --> 56:20.701
(French)

56:28.292 --> 56:30.169
(French)

56:30.294 --> 56:32.338
(long beep)

57:16.716 --> 57:18.759
(regular beeps)

57:45.119 --> 57:47.163
(Doyle vomits)

57:51.876 --> 57:53.920
(French)

57:54.921 --> 57:56.964
Merci.

57:58.299 --> 58:00.343
(Doyle sighs)

58:22.782 --> 58:25.243
What are you lookin' at, asshole?

58:56.232 --> 58:58.276
That's bitter.

58:58.526 --> 59:00.570
It's bitter.

59:02.280 --> 59:04.323
(Doyle snorts and coughs)

59:04.448 --> 59:07.994
I need a doctor. I need an American doctor.

59:08.119 --> 59:11.205
Doctors keep records, papers.

59:12.832 --> 59:14.876
- You want that?
- (retching)

59:15.001 --> 59:17.461
Junkie cop?

59:17.587 --> 59:20.381
They'll throw you off the police force.

59:20.506 --> 59:22.550
Drink.

59:24.093 --> 59:27.054
- (retches)
- Miletto!

59:28.264 --> 59:30.725
(Doyle screams)

01:00:21.567 --> 01:00:23.569
It's cold.

01:00:23.694 --> 01:00:25.738
(distant voices)

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:33.746
- (cell door closes)
- Yeah, that oughta help a lot.

01:00:42.129 --> 01:00:45.007
I feel like I spent a week licking a pool table.

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:47.468
It was three weeks.

01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:53.307
- Where were you guys?
- We looked.

01:00:54.976 --> 01:00:59.147
- Where the fuck were ya?
- 52 men were looking for you full time.

01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:04.527
Aw, shit. If I had 52 men lookin' for somebody
I'd find 'em in three hours in New York!

01:01:04.652 --> 01:01:09.073
- Yes, but Marseilles is not New York.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right it ain't.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.284
Bet your fuckin' ass it ain't New York.

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.537
Scag City.

01:01:14.662 --> 01:01:19.500
I'd like to pull the goddamn city down brick
by brick and put it all in your fucking head.

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.669
You can relax now.

01:01:28.342 --> 01:01:30.386
(distant laughter)

01:01:36.058 --> 01:01:39.437
Shit. I feel like a goddamn pincushion.

01:01:42.523 --> 01:01:47.236
Look, Henry... you're not gonna
make me go cold turkey, are you?

01:01:48.446 --> 01:01:50.865
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, look, I'm s...

01:01:51.657 --> 01:01:56.370
I've seen guys go cold turkey. They put
their fuckin' head right through a steel wall.

01:01:56.496 --> 01:02:00.791
They'd cut their mother's throat for
a $5 bag of scag. Come on, you can't make...

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.586
I call your mother.

01:02:04.045 --> 01:02:07.048
I call your mother. She will be proud of you.

01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:12.803
- Aw, come on. Leave her out of this.
- "Mrs. Doyle, I present your son, the hero."

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:17.558
- Oh, shit. Will you stop this shit?
- Did I ever tell you? I had her once.

01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:20.520
- What a fuck!
- Oh, you...

01:02:20.645 --> 01:02:22.688
(Henri speaks in French)

01:02:34.408 --> 01:02:36.452
Don't quit now.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.664
Don't give up.

01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:44.043
(whispers) Don't give up.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:15.241
I want a fuckin' Hershey bar.

01:03:21.372 --> 01:03:23.416
That's OK.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:41.142
It's not good for Frogs.
Makes 'em jump backwards.

01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.854
(Doyle chuckles)

01:03:44.979 --> 01:03:47.023
Asshole.

01:04:40.701 --> 01:04:42.745
(Doyle moans)

01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:59.345
(knocking)

01:05:04.851 --> 01:05:10.606
Hey. I don't want any of this fuckin' rock!
What are they givin' me?

01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:16.946
Wait a minute... OK. What I want
is a nice, juicy PJ Clarke's hamburger.

01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:20.366
Understand? With blood
runnin' out of it,...

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:25.621
..and some onions on it and some ketchup
and salt, and a beer. OK? All right?

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:28.499
Henry, wait. Wait a minute.

01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:31.752
I need some help, Henry.

01:05:32.587 --> 01:05:34.672
I need some help. I want a doctor, Henry.

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.883
- A fuckin' American doctor.
- Forget it.

01:05:37.008 --> 01:05:40.928
Don't tell me to forget it.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:05:43.723 --> 01:05:48.060
Just wait till you go get the hamburgers.
All right? I'll wait here.

01:05:48.186 --> 01:05:50.730
Just... wait till... All right, wait.

01:05:51.272 --> 01:05:52.607
Goddamn...

01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:55.776
Let's change the order.
I don't want the hamburgers.

01:05:55.902 --> 01:05:59.113
I want... I want some Hershey bars,
Henry. You know what I mean?

01:05:59.238 --> 01:06:04.076
Wait! I want the Hershey bars, Henry. Not
the Frog oatmeal shit you've been givin' me.

01:06:04.202 --> 01:06:06.621
I want real Hershey bars with the nuts in 'em.

01:06:06.746 --> 01:06:10.416
Henry, you got it in the office.
I know goddamn well... Henry!

01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:13.377
Who the fuck would know, Henry?!
Goddammit!

01:06:19.634 --> 01:06:21.677
You motherfuckers!

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.891
(footsteps recede)

01:07:07.598 --> 01:07:09.433
(muffled protests)

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:16.983
Don't tell 'em anything
until you see your fuckin' lawyer!

01:07:17.108 --> 01:07:19.152
Right?

01:07:26.492 --> 01:07:28.870
(Doyle coughs)

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:33.791
This is... (coughs)

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:37.837
It's really good. I never
drink this at home, you know.

01:07:37.962 --> 01:07:41.257
"Gaston de Lagrange. Cognac."

01:07:41.382 --> 01:07:43.301
It's good stuff.

01:07:43.718 --> 01:07:46.053
Only the best for you, Doyle.

01:07:46.179 --> 01:07:48.222
Goddamn.

01:07:49.182 --> 01:07:52.768
When I was a kid, I never drank
because I thought it was a sin,...

01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:54.937
..because of the nuns and everything.

01:07:55.062 --> 01:07:58.316
- Are you Catholic?
- Retired.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.819
Retired?!

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:07.200
Retired, huh? You just
turned in your papers and...

01:08:07.325 --> 01:08:09.494
Do you get a pension? (chuckles)

01:08:14.248 --> 01:08:16.542
Oh, shit.

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:18.711
Ahhhh...

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.511
Well, besides all that...

01:08:29.095 --> 01:08:34.018
You didn't imagine me, did you?
But besides all that... (chuckles)

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:42.609
When I was a... um...

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:49.492
..a kid, you know, with the nuns
and the confessions and all that,...

01:08:49.617 --> 01:08:52.286
..I was a ballpayer... ballplayer.

01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:55.456
I was a ballplayer!

01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:58.584
Baseball player.

01:08:58.709 --> 01:09:01.879
Yeah. You know,
I had a tryout with the Yankees.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:07.844
- You know what the Yankees are?
- Yes. As in "Yankee go home."

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.011
Yeah. No!

01:09:13.099 --> 01:09:14.934
No, uh...

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.899
Uh...

01:09:23.901 --> 01:09:27.071
No, the Yankee baseball... baseball team.

01:09:27.488 --> 01:09:30.448
Yeah, I had a tryout with them and...

01:09:31.325 --> 01:09:34.703
..they sent me down to the... the minors.

01:09:34.828 --> 01:09:39.082
And the poblem...
poblem... problem was that...

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.630
..there was a fuckin' kid there, and he was...

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:50.928
..the fastest bastard, he was fuckin' fast.

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:55.349
And he... he played shortstop
at the time, and he...

01:09:59.437 --> 01:10:02.106
He could hit the ball a fuckin' ton.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:04.609
A fuckin' ton!

01:10:06.652 --> 01:10:08.946
- You know what "fuck" means?
- Yeah.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:11.824
(Doyle chuckles) Yeah.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:15.828
Well, I was in spring training...

01:10:15.953 --> 01:10:18.623
..and I saw this kid,...

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:22.126
..and I just immediately took the test for cops.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.798
That kid was Mickey Mantle.

01:10:35.807 --> 01:10:38.351
You know who Mickey Mantle was?

01:10:38.476 --> 01:10:42.063
- You fuckhead.
- No, I can't say that I know.

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:47.109
You don't know
who Mickey Mantle was? Huh?

01:10:48.694 --> 01:10:50.738
How about Willie Mays?

01:10:50.863 --> 01:10:57.078
Say hey! Willie Mays!
The mighty Willie Mays. See?

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:01.165
No.

01:11:04.168 --> 01:11:07.380
Max Lanier. A Frog.

01:11:10.508 --> 01:11:14.011
Jean Kiley. You remember Jean Kiley?

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:18.224
- Gene Kelly?
- Gene... Not Gene Kelly.

01:11:19.392 --> 01:11:21.602
Jean Kiley, the fuckin' skier.

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.022
Oh. You mean Jean-Claude Killy.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.276
That's what I said! Yes. Fuck, yeah.

01:11:29.777 --> 01:11:31.654
Good athlete.

01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:39.579
Well, and... Whitey Ford. Goddamn.
You know who Whitey Ford was?

01:11:41.289 --> 01:11:45.126
Oh... shit. He was a dandy little southpaw.

01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:48.379
That's what we called him.
He was a dandy little southpaw.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:52.758
- Southpaw?
- Yeah. He was a lefty.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:56.304
- You mean a communist?
- No, he was a Republican.

01:11:56.429 --> 01:12:01.184
But he was somethin', I tell you.
He was somethin'. He was...

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.899
He was... uh...

01:12:08.649 --> 01:12:10.485
..um... a lefty.

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.820
He threw with his left hand.

01:12:12.945 --> 01:12:15.823
Understand? With his south hand.

01:12:16.491 --> 01:12:18.951
With his south paw.

01:12:19.076 --> 01:12:21.746
That's why we called him a lefty.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:25.541
You got it? (chuckles)

01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:28.503
Look here...

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.255
(mutters)

01:12:31.839 --> 01:12:33.925
(Doyle giggles)

01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:36.177
(mutters)

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:50.233
And the batter was standing like this.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.778
You gotta throw me the ball.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:57.240
Wait a minute. (mutters)

01:13:00.117 --> 01:13:02.161
OK. Ready.

01:13:05.665 --> 01:13:08.751
- You never saw any baseball, did you?
- No.

01:13:08.876 --> 01:13:10.920
Shit.

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:17.301
Well, Whitey Ford was a dandy southpaw.

01:13:18.845 --> 01:13:20.888
He was...

01:13:29.188 --> 01:13:31.232
(incoherent)

01:13:31.858 --> 01:13:34.986
Give me one, Henry, quick!

01:13:36.821 --> 01:13:38.865
(incoherent pleading)

01:13:45.413 --> 01:13:48.791
You motherfucker!

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.669
(Doyle sobs)

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:54.797
- Drink it.
- (yells)

01:14:20.948 --> 01:14:24.869
He'd hit the fuckin' apple ball
with the fuckin' stick!

01:14:28.372 --> 01:14:33.544
- Tell me about Southpaw.
- I told you about that fuckin' southpaw!

01:14:36.547 --> 01:14:39.634
- I can't take it no more!
- And Mickey Mantle.

01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:41.803
Mickey Mantle sucks!

01:14:46.724 --> 01:14:50.853
- Do you ski?
- Do I look like I can ski, you fuckhead?!

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.023
I can barely walk!

01:14:56.526 --> 01:14:59.111
I need help, goddamnit!

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.909
Shit.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:22.051
- I have your breakfast. I hope you can eat it.
- Uh... I'll try.

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.655
- Are you gonna take me home?
- Not yet.

01:15:46.534 --> 01:15:49.579
You were cold. We'll warm you up.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:54.709
And maybe see a little
of Marseilles too, hein?

01:16:12.894 --> 01:16:16.189
I don't remember anything.
They'd just knocked me on my ass.

01:16:16.314 --> 01:16:18.816
Anything? Any detail?

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.738
I don't remember anything.

01:16:46.385 --> 01:16:48.930
I'd like to have some of that.

01:16:49.055 --> 01:16:52.934
You're kidding. A woman now
would finish you off.

01:16:53.893 --> 01:16:56.062
Not the woman, dummy. What she's eating.

01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:08.950
Listen, asshole, tell me the truth.

01:17:11.869 --> 01:17:14.288
I was set up, wasn't l?

01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:22.964
Whose idea was it?

01:17:23.756 --> 01:17:26.342
What difference does it make?

01:17:35.226 --> 01:17:37.687
They sent me over here to work with you.

01:17:42.233 --> 01:17:46.279
You put me on the street
so Charnier could blow me away.

01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:52.034
That's beautiful. Beautiful.

01:17:55.079 --> 01:17:57.290
Why didn't you figure this out earlier?

01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:02.420
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

01:18:07.466 --> 01:18:09.677
Cos I'm a bigger asshole than you are.

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:21.100
Henry? It's Doyle.

01:20:21.225 --> 01:20:24.896
- Workin' kinda late at the office, aren't ya?
- Where are you, Popeye?

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:27.773
I'm at Charnier's place.
I suddenly remembered it.

01:20:27.899 --> 01:20:31.444
It's the Hotel Colonnades.
Used to be the Hotel Tanger.

01:20:31.569 --> 01:20:33.821
It's on the Rue Rappatu. You got that?

01:20:34.405 --> 01:20:36.365
- Stay where you are.
- OK.

01:20:36.491 --> 01:20:40.828
Oh, Henry. Bring some water. A lot of it.

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:01.265
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.434
- Exterminator.
- Quoi?

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:06.646
Rats. You got rats, buddy.

01:21:09.524 --> 01:21:11.567
(uproar)

01:21:15.488 --> 01:21:17.198
(shouting)

01:21:40.054 --> 01:21:43.307
Come on outta there, you fuckin' rats!

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.394
Come on out or I'll burn you out!

01:21:46.519 --> 01:21:49.230
- (woman screams)
- (sirens)

01:22:05.371 --> 01:22:08.124
Come on, you rats! Come on out!

01:22:15.256 --> 01:22:16.841
Everybody out!

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:24.307
Hey, hey, hey! Move it! Hot pussy here!

01:23:06.724 --> 01:23:09.769
Hey! You moustached motherfuckers!

01:23:17.568 --> 01:23:19.403
Hey!

01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:45.888
Doyle! Doyle, you knew!
You always knew the name of this place!

01:23:46.013 --> 01:23:50.143
You knew and you wouldn't tell me!
Doyle, I deserve an answer!

01:23:52.854 --> 01:23:56.023
Look at that! That's your answer. Fuck you!

01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:59.443
I came over after Charnier
and I'm gonna get his ass!

01:24:01.279 --> 01:24:04.490
Where is that goddamn motherfucker?
Where is he?!

01:24:12.206 --> 01:24:15.376
(pleading in French)

01:24:17.128 --> 01:24:20.131
That's enough! Stop it, Doyle!

01:24:20.256 --> 01:24:23.176
- (French)
- (Doyle) Look at this, asshole!

01:24:23.301 --> 01:24:25.303
He told us what we want.

01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:27.513
- That's enough now.
- OK.

01:24:27.638 --> 01:24:30.308
You'd better be right. I'll tell you that.

01:24:30.683 --> 01:24:32.727
I'll come lookin' for ya!

01:24:33.811 --> 01:24:35.855
I'll knock your dick stiff.

01:24:36.481 --> 01:24:38.524
Look at my hat.

01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:20.358
(French)

01:25:28.658 --> 01:25:30.701
(French)

01:25:31.744 --> 01:25:34.497
This time, Doyle, you stay right next to me.

01:25:35.581 --> 01:25:37.416
Come on.

01:28:08.067 --> 01:28:10.111
Where's my fucking gun?!

01:28:27.044 --> 01:28:29.130
(French)

01:28:40.975 --> 01:28:42.268
(French)

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.164
(rush of water)

01:29:19.806 --> 01:29:22.892
I hope you can swim, asshole!

01:29:44.038 --> 01:29:46.082
(French)

01:29:53.464 --> 01:29:56.467
Hey! Doyle, come on!

01:32:21.529 --> 01:32:24.031
(police siren)

01:32:24.157 --> 01:32:25.825
Henri! Henri!

01:32:59.525 --> 01:33:01.569
(knocking on door)

01:33:03.488 --> 01:33:05.031
Yeah?

01:33:05.156 --> 01:33:07.200
(Barthélémy) Doyle?

01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:20.379
Commissaire Delacroix.
He wants your passport.

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:26.636
There is a plane for Barcelona in the morning
with a connection to New York.

01:33:26.761 --> 01:33:29.430
You'll get your passport back
when you get on it.

01:33:29.514 --> 01:33:32.016
(French)

01:33:34.852 --> 01:33:37.146
(commissaire continues in French)

01:33:42.193 --> 01:33:44.445
Do you need me to translate?

01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:51.118
They called your boss in New York.

01:33:51.244 --> 01:33:53.329
(French)

01:33:53.496 --> 01:33:55.748
Your passport, Popeye.

01:33:58.584 --> 01:34:01.963
Why don't you tell him
I lost it in the dry dock?

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.112
(French)

01:34:26.237 --> 01:34:29.782
He wants you to stay in the hotel
until we say you leave.

01:36:52.175 --> 01:36:54.218
(French)

01:36:55.011 --> 01:36:57.180
My French no good. In English.

01:36:57.305 --> 01:37:00.892
I say nothing till consul get here.
I know nothing of last night.

01:37:01.017 --> 01:37:03.686
You must have known
something was stuck to the hull.

01:37:03.769 --> 01:37:07.773
We come for fixing of the rudder!
I know nothing about the dope!

01:37:07.899 --> 01:37:11.194
- You will wait here, Captain.
- I go back in Dutch territory.

01:37:11.319 --> 01:37:14.822
No! You are in French territory,
and you will stay on French territory.

01:37:36.511 --> 01:37:39.347
I don't want to see that. Keep it under wraps.

01:37:40.723 --> 01:37:42.767
- What are you gonna do now?
- We wait.

01:37:42.892 --> 01:37:45.853
When this consul comes,
we'll go to headquarters and talk.

01:37:45.978 --> 01:37:49.232
And when the consul leaves,
we don't talk so much.

01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:53.319
Don't lock this bum up yet.
He hasn't been paid.

01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:57.740
Charnier would only pay after delivery.
Last night there wasn't time.

01:37:57.865 --> 01:38:00.409
This Dutchman will wait till he gets his cash.

01:38:00.535 --> 01:38:05.081
- It could be in Holland, on deposit in Geneva.
- No, it'll be here, and in cash.

01:38:05.331 --> 01:38:08.876
Charnier won't stiff this guy.
He's got too many stories to tell ya.

01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:11.337
- I don't know.
- Look.

01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:15.091
If you follow this guy
all over Europe, in a week's time...

01:38:15.216 --> 01:38:17.927
..there'll be nickel and dime bags
on 126th Street.

01:38:18.052 --> 01:38:20.721
Let him go. Let him walk away.

01:38:22.306 --> 01:38:24.809
He'll lead us right to Frog One.

01:38:34.193 --> 01:38:36.237
You owe me one.

01:38:55.631 --> 01:38:57.675
OK, merci.

01:39:06.559 --> 01:39:10.938
We've got the harbour covered,
in case he tries a rendezvous by boat.

01:39:12.899 --> 01:39:16.903
- When's that ship scheduled to leave?
- The day after tomorrow.

01:39:20.448 --> 01:39:21.574
OK.

01:40:04.075 --> 01:40:07.745
It will get very difficult
if we see nothing tomorrow, Popeye.

01:42:11.619 --> 01:42:13.663
Hey, look. Look!

01:42:22.755 --> 01:42:26.050
Who in the hell does that
look like? Henry Kissinger?

01:42:33.391 --> 01:42:35.434
(French)

01:42:36.727 --> 01:42:39.730
- Alexandre, Raoul, Émil...
- Come on!

01:43:43.211 --> 01:43:45.254
They're comin' in.

01:43:47.673 --> 01:43:49.801
(ship's horn)

01:44:06.776 --> 01:44:08.903
- Hey, there he is.
- Which one?

01:44:10.196 --> 01:44:14.534
The guy with the cigarette in his mouth.
They switched bags!

01:44:15.076 --> 01:44:17.537
The white collar. He's got a white collar.

01:44:17.662 --> 01:44:20.081
(French)

01:44:21.207 --> 01:44:24.836
Tell 'em he's got a white-and-blue bag
around his shoulder.

01:44:28.965 --> 01:44:31.884
- Getting ready to cross the street.
- (French)

01:44:57.493 --> 01:44:58.911
Oui.

01:44:59.453 --> 01:45:01.372
(French)

01:45:52.298 --> 01:45:55.343
- (French)
- Christ, look at this.

01:46:03.559 --> 01:46:06.229
(# "La Marseillaise")

01:46:30.628 --> 01:46:32.964
(French)

01:47:13.463 --> 01:47:15.506
(French)

01:47:53.878 --> 01:47:55.296
He goes to the Arab quarter.

01:48:08.351 --> 01:48:09.685
(French)

01:49:58.586 --> 01:50:00.630
Over here!

01:50:03.841 --> 01:50:05.009
(gunshots)

01:50:08.805 --> 01:50:11.474
(machine-gun fire)

01:50:14.811 --> 01:50:16.437
Doyle!

01:50:18.981 --> 01:50:20.608
(shouting)

01:50:25.613 --> 01:50:27.031
(shouts)

01:50:36.249 --> 01:50:38.584
(machine-gun fire)

01:51:47.528 --> 01:51:49.572
(French)

01:53:37.013 --> 01:53:38.806
(car horn)

01:53:42.185 --> 01:53:44.729
(car horn)

01:53:48.232 --> 01:53:50.276
Get out of the way. Get out.

01:54:02.121 --> 01:54:04.165
Come on, move it. Come on!

01:57:35.084 --> 01:57:37.211
(ship's horn)

01:57:37.587 --> 01:57:41.090
(radio message in French)

01:57:47.472 --> 01:57:50.266
(ship's horn)

01:57:52.685 --> 01:57:54.854
(laboured breathing)

01:57:56.063 --> 01:57:58.232
Charnier?
