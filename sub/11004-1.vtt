01:17.800 --> 01:19.486
Want me to go call him up?

01:20.135 --> 01:21.135
No.

01:24.773 --> 01:27.388
You want a cup of coffee?

01:27.488 --> 01:28.488
No.

01:34.683 --> 01:36.674
You wanna go?

01:55.737 --> 01:57.137
You OK?

01:59.975 --> 02:01.306
Uh-huh.

02:54.530 --> 02:57.363
I'm betting you're awake in there.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.267
Are you?

03:02.471 --> 03:04.585
What do you want?

03:04.685 --> 03:08.120
- Figured I'd like to talk to you.
- About what?

03:08.220 --> 03:13.598
Fuck do you care? You ain't making money
at the side of the road. Get up. Start driving.

03:13.698 --> 03:15.932
Put me in the cab. I keep you up.

03:16.032 --> 03:19.600
- You're with the Teamsters.
- That's right.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.803
I can't take you. They find out
you rode my cab, I'm out of a job.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.742
You best get used to it
cos I'm coming with you.

03:25.842 --> 03:28.352
- The fuck you are.
- Fuck I'm not.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.693
- I said, get the fuck off my cab.
- Have a cigarette.

03:42.793 --> 03:46.028
I said, get the fuck out.
They find you in here, it's my job.

03:46.128 --> 03:50.983
What fucking kind of pussy are you? Some
guy in Duluth tells you who stays in the cab?

03:52.821 --> 03:57.656
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I know what that is, baby.

03:58.327 --> 04:02.809
Your driving cig burns down,
keeps you from falling asleep at the wheel.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.846
I know, I been there. I got scars of my own.
That's why I want you to listen to me.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.983
Get the fuck out of my cab.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.993
Baby, you got the balls,
and you might get lucky and kill me.

04:15.093 --> 04:22.005
Barring that, you'll hear my speech about the
Teamsters, so just drive the fucking truck.

04:22.684 --> 04:26.347
All that I'm saying
is there's a lot more there for us.

04:26.755 --> 04:31.642
It's right, it's just, it's due us, it's possible.

04:31.742 --> 04:35.776
The downtime pay,
pay for deadhead and medical.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.513
All the things I've been saying.

04:38.613 --> 04:42.593
Bobby, not only is it possible, it's right there.

04:43.972 --> 04:49.523
When they have to negotiate, they say to you,
"Ride with the Teamsters, lose your job."

04:49.623 --> 04:52.125
- They treat us like dirt.
- I know that.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.931
They got us driving to pay the rent. Every
couple of weeks, someone falls asleep.

04:56.031 --> 04:59.465
- I know that.
- Stuck 10 hours, rig broke down, no pay.

04:59.565 --> 05:04.104
Yeah, I know that.
We're trying to strike the company, you see.

05:04.204 --> 05:08.629
- I can't go out on strike.
- You can't afford not to go.

05:12.534 --> 05:17.753
- How you gonna get back to your cab?
- Another driver just like you, baby.

05:17.853 --> 05:22.625
- Now, listen to me. I want you to stop by...
- I can't sign up with you.

05:22.725 --> 05:28.262
You will sign up, but I didn't say sign up.
I said stop by.

05:28.362 --> 05:33.344
All right, pull this thing over right here.
You don't wanna be seen with me.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.942
Things been a little tough. You know kids...

06:37.519 --> 06:42.907
Don't count on their best efforts.
Negotiate from a position of strength.

06:43.007 --> 06:47.912
What can they take away from you?
Put it down.

06:48.012 --> 06:51.781
Put it down. If they put it down,
then they can't do nothing.

06:51.881 --> 06:53.785
Bobby, how you doin'?

06:53.885 --> 06:58.222
You're saying "I don't know."
"But I need my job."

06:58.322 --> 07:02.755
I'm saying, guarantee your job.

07:02.855 --> 07:06.494
Guarantee your wage.
You're working for peanuts...

07:06.594 --> 07:09.061
- What's going on?
- Fella the Teamsters.

07:09.161 --> 07:10.630
- What's he want?
- Strike.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.436
Hey, let's get to work.
Come on, let's move a little faster, huh?

07:14.536 --> 07:17.475
Let's get going.
Ciaro, you're on number ten.

07:17.575 --> 07:21.108
- Fitzgrieg, you haul it out.
- Stop their exploitation.

07:21.208 --> 07:26.381
I see a man with the power of an international
union to eliminate all this bullshit.

07:26.481 --> 07:31.484
Let them move the fuckin' crates.
Let's see how long they'll never negotiate.

07:31.584 --> 07:35.555
They've been feeding you dog shit,
telling you it's Cream of Wheat.

07:35.655 --> 07:38.909
You, too.
Hey, I've had it with you.

07:41.516 --> 07:45.801
I ain't afraid of these cocksuckers.
I ain't afraid of nobody.

07:45.901 --> 07:48.868
What are you afraid of? Hey, you.

07:48.968 --> 07:53.006
You, you son of a bitch. You. You. Yeah.

07:53.106 --> 07:57.076
You rode with me 85 miles,
smoked my cigarettes, listened to my jokes.

07:57.176 --> 08:02.296
After what I did for you,
what are you gonna do for me, huh? Huh?

08:03.839 --> 08:06.330
You just cost me my job.

08:07.409 --> 08:11.025
You cost me my fucking job.
You cost me my job.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.260
You cost me my fucking job.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.830
Put it down. Put the crate down.
You men, put the crates down.

08:17.930 --> 08:21.366
- Let it spoil.
- Hey, where do you think you are, a picnic?

08:21.466 --> 08:26.917
Put the fucking crates down.
Cross the line. Join the Teamsters.

08:27.762 --> 08:30.377
That's right. That's right. Put it down.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.797
Pick that crate up.

08:33.802 --> 08:36.687
You don't need some manager.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.886
You don't need some manager
telling you what's true.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.158
You don't need to worry about
killing no fucking golden goose.

08:43.258 --> 08:45.894
You guys want your jobs? Get back to work.

08:45.994 --> 08:48.882
Don't you got mouths to feed?
You can't fight back.

09:06.101 --> 09:09.284
- Get outta here, will ya?
- I'm sick and tired of talking to you.

09:09.384 --> 09:13.398
- Quit coming in here. No union.
- You're wearing me out. Crumb.

09:14.409 --> 09:15.808
Ladies.

09:30.659 --> 09:33.409
- Walk a little bit here.
- What the fuck you want?

09:33.509 --> 09:35.474
You cost me my job.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.711
- And what?
- I'm gonna cut your throat.

09:37.811 --> 09:42.051
You're obviously a man with
a profound sense of justice.

09:42.151 --> 09:44.617
- is there a problem?
- I got no quarrel with you.

09:44.717 --> 09:48.356
Yes you do, lad. You got a beef
with my partner, you got a beef with me.

09:48.456 --> 09:51.024
Pull a knife while a guy's unprotected.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.842
- Get fuckin' back.
- No.

09:56.518 --> 09:58.748
I couldn't have that on my conscience.

10:02.757 --> 10:03.757
See?

10:04.437 --> 10:08.021
Life's a negotiation. It's all give and take.

10:23.845 --> 10:26.439
I'm sorry I cost you your job.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.766
I'm oh, so sorry.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.402
And yes, yes, and...

10:35.502 --> 10:38.442
- Everything I did, why?
- To help the working man.

10:38.542 --> 10:41.946
- You're fuckin' A.
- And I'm a working man. So's Jimmy.

10:42.046 --> 10:45.849
Just the same as you.
You gotta eat, I gotta eat.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.684
I got no desire what I do hurts you.

10:48.784 --> 10:53.286
You got a beef with me.
What can I do to help?

10:53.386 --> 10:57.559
- Cos everybody's got a right to eat.
- That's right.

10:57.659 --> 11:03.432
Take these cocksuckers. Honest laundryman,
signed with the Teamsters.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.802
- Some cocksucker.
- You see that guy?

11:06.902 --> 11:10.016
I'm goin' to see him tonight.

11:10.658 --> 11:14.010
Some guy - be it you, the trucks,
some guy out of laundry...

11:14.110 --> 11:18.746
We are out there.
Jimmy's out there. Organizing.

11:18.846 --> 11:23.552
So the strength of collective bargaining
protects the working man.

11:23.652 --> 11:27.119
Some cocksucker won't organize, won't join,

11:27.219 --> 11:29.958
won't come along,
letâ€™s his brother pay the price,

11:30.058 --> 11:34.311
but won't he take the benefits
his brothers have accrued?

11:36.284 --> 11:38.275
You fuckin' know he will.

11:40.188 --> 11:42.349
Nobody wanted to hurt you.

11:44.025 --> 11:46.391
What am I gonna do for money?

11:49.297 --> 11:54.325
- Can he drive a truck?
- That's where I met him, isn't it?

11:55.603 --> 11:58.470
You want a bit of work? One night.

12:07.348 --> 12:09.564
Give me the fuckin' knife.

12:09.664 --> 12:13.485
You wanna go around, buy a gun.
Go like a white man.

13:03.805 --> 13:06.205
This cocksucker...

13:07.742 --> 13:10.643
"The Idle Hour Laundry."

13:13.248 --> 13:16.566
Cop comes by two minutes.

13:16.666 --> 13:19.232
We'll let him pass.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.206
- How'd you do on the west side?
- Working on it.

13:23.306 --> 13:27.874
I got the guys, Mallory Plant.
I'm gonna talk to 'em tomorrow.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.295
Yeah. Hey. There he is.

13:38.973 --> 13:41.373
Yes, indeed.

13:43.711 --> 13:46.373
Right into the thick of things.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.661
- Here we go.
- I got it.

14:18.880 --> 14:23.340
You stay here.
Turn the motor on, put it in gear.

15:13.868 --> 15:14.868
Shit.

15:16.651 --> 15:18.629
Holy shit.

15:22.577 --> 15:24.359
Jesus Christ.

15:24.459 --> 15:26.661
- Jimmy.
- The fucker blew up.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.031
- Jimmy.
- Jesus.

15:29.131 --> 15:32.435
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

15:32.535 --> 15:36.102
Get somebody. Where's the fuckin' phone?

15:36.202 --> 15:40.076
Get a phone. Oh. Get a fuckin' phone.

15:40.176 --> 15:43.562
Jesus, it just fuckin' blew up.

15:45.967 --> 15:49.684
He got out the cab,

15:49.784 --> 15:53.421
and ran in to see what the thing is

15:53.521 --> 15:58.395
that he thought he heard
screaming in the joint.

15:58.495 --> 16:00.470
He goes in...

16:02.817 --> 16:05.899
And who's this? is that the way it happened?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.203
- Yeah.
- Why?

16:08.303 --> 16:09.503
It is.

16:10.639 --> 16:14.789
- How's the other fella?
- He's dying in there.

16:31.979 --> 16:32.979
Amen.

16:35.183 --> 16:41.735
There may still be enough time, my son,
to rid your soul of whatever sin there may be,

16:41.835 --> 16:47.110
and if you did this thing,
simply to confess and lay it before God.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.129
- I...
- What?

16:55.303 --> 16:59.433
Yes, my son, what is it?

17:12.019 --> 17:14.351
Billy Flynn.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.058
Wasn't he?

17:30.304 --> 17:32.829
Fuckin' good old days.

17:35.710 --> 17:38.201
You cost me my job, Jim.

17:40.248 --> 17:43.240
You cost me my fuckin' job.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.920
Fuck you.

17:48.070 --> 17:50.455
You're wearing me out.

17:51.826 --> 17:54.874
Never let a stranger in your cab.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.374
Uh-huh.

17:57.542 --> 18:03.386
Never let a stranger in your cab,
in your house, or in your heart,

18:03.486 --> 18:07.087
unless he is a friend of labour.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.666
Ain't that the truth.

18:12.246 --> 18:15.909
But if he is that friend of labour...

18:17.819 --> 18:20.219
Want a cup of coffee?

18:22.990 --> 18:26.983
But if he is that friend of labour...

18:38.105 --> 18:41.506
But if he is that friend of labour...

18:45.847 --> 18:51.201
But if he is a friend to labour,
he's the only friend you've got.

18:51.301 --> 18:54.266
And you'd best listen to that man.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.740
If he's got the scars on his knuckles,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.407
if he's got the muscles in his arms,

19:00.507 --> 19:06.248
if he's been out on that road, like you and me,
then he's the only friend you've got.

19:06.348 --> 19:10.085
Are you listening? The only friend you've got.

19:10.185 --> 19:12.684
The race, the race of labour...

19:12.784 --> 19:19.393
- We're the union, boys.
- ..like the race of Israel of old, is saddened...

19:19.493 --> 19:23.029
He knows the words,
but he don't know the music.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.108
Hey, Pally.

19:26.187 --> 19:31.305
Team up with people who'll stand by you. To
the Kreger Company, you're part of the truck.

19:31.405 --> 19:34.609
You're just part of the truck,
you're the nut behind the wheel.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.344
The minute they find a way to replace you...

19:37.444 --> 19:39.613
Get the fuck down off my cab.

19:39.713 --> 19:43.283
- Get back, Jimmy.
- All right. All right.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.453
Fuck gonna shoot me, the fucking scab.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.459
- Jimmy, how you doing?
- Fine, Fitz.

19:48.559 --> 19:54.628
Somebody ought to shoot that motherfucker.
Let him organize the dead.

19:54.728 --> 19:55.728
Hey.

19:56.617 --> 19:59.017
They're letting them in.

20:01.022 --> 20:03.354
It don't look good.

20:04.525 --> 20:07.573
Hey. Get down off them trucks.

20:07.673 --> 20:12.178
You stupid dago. Get down off those trucks.
You fuckin' scabs.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.348
That's my job you're taking away from me.

20:15.448 --> 20:20.053
You scab bastards, you.
Hey. Hey. Come here.

20:20.153 --> 20:23.425
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

20:23.525 --> 20:27.431
You think they're gonna be loyal to you, huh?
Crossing over this line?

20:27.531 --> 20:29.899
- Get out of the way.
- You know what you are to them?

20:29.999 --> 20:33.803
A scab, just like you are to us. A fucking scab.

20:33.903 --> 20:36.152
Fuck you. Get out of the way.

20:42.296 --> 20:45.249
Hey, we're blowing this fuckin' strike, Fitz.

20:45.349 --> 20:50.152
I better organize some people this week,
or my family ain't gonna eat.

20:50.252 --> 20:52.569
Where's the justice in that?

20:54.008 --> 20:55.270
Oh, hell.

20:57.745 --> 20:59.838
We're gonna get in another punch-up.

21:01.582 --> 21:04.596
If we can just keep these
fuckin' dagos off our backs...

21:04.696 --> 21:07.085
- Just keep your head down.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:14.662 --> 21:17.676
Are you listening? Are you listening?

21:17.776 --> 21:21.098
We're with the Teamsters. We're with you.

21:23.237 --> 21:26.229
Pull these trucks over.
What's the matter with you?

22:03.778 --> 22:04.978
Jimmy.

22:15.122 --> 22:17.818
Some people wanna see you.

22:56.063 --> 22:58.577
He said "What are you afraid of?"

22:58.677 --> 23:01.382
Tell him it's none of his fuckin' business.

23:01.482 --> 23:04.404
Go on. Tell him what I said.

23:23.257 --> 23:27.374
He said to say that
you're costing him money and that

23:27.474 --> 23:31.192
you're pissing on his whole operation.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.813
I wanna...

23:34.913 --> 23:36.733
He said to shut up.

23:41.642 --> 23:46.670
He said, why shouldn't he take you out in the
alley and beat you until you beg for death?

23:48.449 --> 23:51.111
This is the question.

23:54.255 --> 23:57.747
When you fuck with the livelihood
of the people under his protection,

24:00.928 --> 24:03.920
why shouldn't he kill you?

24:09.603 --> 24:13.937
He said, if you were in his place
what would you do?

24:16.911 --> 24:21.245
Tell him he gives me a cup of coffee,
I'll answer his questions.

24:41.235 --> 24:45.228
Don't go anywhere.
I'm gonna need you here.

24:46.774 --> 24:47.774
Now,

24:48.555 --> 24:51.393
Here's the situation that we got here.

24:51.493 --> 24:55.312
Bring your man D'Alli in.
He'll understand the numbers.

24:57.518 --> 25:01.533
Kreger's got lettuce rotting
all over the south side of the city.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.338
You're runnin' men in to break the strike.

25:04.438 --> 25:08.508
The strike goes nowhere, the people go
nowhere. Doesn't do anybody any good.

25:08.608 --> 25:12.088
We'll win the strike. Thank you very much.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.500
The thing of it is, see...

25:19.106 --> 25:22.823
All right, all right.
The end of the strike...

25:22.923 --> 25:26.357
Let me have your attention for a minute.

25:26.457 --> 25:29.928
.. is due to one thing and one thing only.

25:30.028 --> 25:33.532
To the efforts of one man who went out there,

25:33.632 --> 25:36.472
who went out there in the cold,

25:36.572 --> 25:39.672
who was out there day and night,

25:39.772 --> 25:44.242
speaking the word, spreading the word.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.993
And the word was Teamsters.

25:48.002 --> 25:50.835
The word was unity.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.091
And it overcame the scabs.

25:56.191 --> 25:59.129
And it overcame the company.

25:59.229 --> 26:02.842
It made the day, and it made us our contract.

26:08.155 --> 26:10.607
Here's the man who led us through that fight,

26:10.707 --> 26:16.242
the man who beat Kreger,
who broke them down and who took us in,

26:16.342 --> 26:18.878
our new business manager,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.991
Red Bennett.

26:33.180 --> 26:36.877
Thank you, thank you.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

26:39.420 --> 26:43.205
This is a very embarrassing position for me.

26:43.305 --> 26:45.383
Ha. You bet.

26:48.495 --> 26:50.895
None of us who were there,

26:51.565 --> 26:55.831
none of us, are undeserving of recognition.

26:59.506 --> 27:03.657
It was the group, as it always is.

27:03.757 --> 27:05.735
The group.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.711
Full of shit.

27:15.923 --> 27:19.871
You don't get the wops to back off,
we don't win the strike.

27:19.971 --> 27:25.314
- That's right.
- Hey, this is my nephew.

27:25.414 --> 27:27.379
- Petey Connelly.
- Pleased to meet you.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.479
Hi.

27:29.452 --> 27:33.099
Hey, Petey, Petey, I'll catch up with you later.

27:36.977 --> 27:40.627
- Jimmy.
- Yeah, I'm terrific.

27:40.727 --> 27:43.532
- I got a lot to learn from you.
- That's true.

27:43.632 --> 27:46.131
- How did you do it?
- You don't wanna know.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.470
- Yes, I do. That's why I asked.
- Oh, I see.

27:49.570 --> 27:52.340
- I wanna know.
- You're drunk.

27:52.440 --> 27:56.278
I tell you, you go show off
tomorrow morning, tell your nephew.

27:56.378 --> 28:00.716
Jim. Jim, I'm born. I'm bred.

28:00.816 --> 28:03.720
- Yeah.
- I wanna know.

28:03.820 --> 28:07.887
I wanna put this together.
I wanna be the guy th...

28:07.987 --> 28:13.329
I'm sure you do, Fitz.
So I'm gonna give you a piece of advice.

28:13.429 --> 28:17.612
Don't ask for something
that it's a burden to you if you get it.

28:19.853 --> 28:20.853
Huh?

28:21.905 --> 28:25.972
Like information or something, huh?

28:26.072 --> 28:29.052
Like what a guy did.

28:36.637 --> 28:39.504
You want to know what I did?

28:43.077 --> 28:46.659
I told the wops
"Don't drive the Kreger trucks."

28:46.759 --> 28:49.098
"Scab labour. Help the Teamsters."

28:49.198 --> 28:54.666
They said "Why should I?"
I said "Teamsters drive the Kreger trucks."

28:54.766 --> 28:59.237
"Half the trucks we drive, we take 'em
to a warehouse of your choosing,

28:59.337 --> 29:02.278
and you steal the contents."

29:02.378 --> 29:07.095
What do you think of that, Fitz?
Does it shock or delight you?

29:08.135 --> 29:10.126
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

29:10.237 --> 29:14.286
There's a negotiating tactic
you can use next time you get all jammed up.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.327
What a fuckin' guy. Hey, look.

29:17.427 --> 29:21.128
I'm gonna go out, get drunk, get laid.

29:21.228 --> 29:24.033
I don't blame you for it.
It was a famous victory.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.733
Come with me.

29:27.603 --> 29:30.989
Nah, I'm busy. You go get laid.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.630
Fucking guy.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.447
So why'd you tell him?

29:41.547 --> 29:45.652
The thing of it is, a guy's close to you,
you can't slight him.

29:45.752 --> 29:50.688
You can't slight that guy.
A real grievance can be resolved.

29:50.788 --> 29:56.362
Differences can be resolved.
But an imaginary hurt?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.262
A slight?

29:58.732 --> 30:03.713
That motherfucker
gonna hate you till the day he dies.

30:04.958 --> 30:07.449
Should I have told him?

30:09.296 --> 30:12.147
6-to-5 and pick 'em.

30:12.247 --> 30:15.531
And so we move on.

30:17.237 --> 30:20.968
- Ain't that something?
- Yeah. You did good.

30:25.879 --> 30:26.879
Yeah.

30:29.116 --> 30:31.534
Al. Pretty chilly tonight.

30:31.634 --> 30:35.903
- Oh, yeah. I feel it in my bones.
- All right.

30:36.003 --> 30:38.171
So how much money you make organizing?

30:38.271 --> 30:43.321
- What?
- How much money you make organizing?

30:44.798 --> 30:46.798
All right?

30:47.334 --> 30:50.633
- Give you a hand?
- Yeah.

30:51.205 --> 30:53.522
A man who ain't afraid to get his hands dirty.

30:53.622 --> 30:57.960
I ain't afraid to get 'em dirty or get 'em
bloody. I ain't afraid of a fuckin' thing.

30:58.060 --> 31:00.795
I'll tell you why.
Cos I'm a member of a brotherhood.

31:00.895 --> 31:05.200
Jimmy Hoffa, Local 299,
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

31:05.300 --> 31:09.869
Now go around, get a big stone
or something, chock up this back wheel.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.307
You want some help?

31:12.407 --> 31:16.543
$10 each new member,
10% of the first year's dues.

31:16.643 --> 31:17.710
That's what you make?

31:17.810 --> 31:20.182
What I make is none of your fuckin' business.

31:20.282 --> 31:24.316
It's what I'll pay you, you come in with me.
I wanna tell you something...

31:24.416 --> 31:27.019
I'll listen to any man
ain't afraid to get his hands dirty.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.992
First man I ever seen
go out of his way to help a trucker.

31:30.092 --> 31:32.962
Someday this man will be
president of the United States.

31:33.062 --> 31:36.899
Fuck that. Someday I'm gonna
be president of the Teamsters.

31:36.999 --> 31:41.432
Now I want you to listen to me. When this
tin Lizzie breaks down, who pays you?

31:41.532 --> 31:43.906
I'll tell you. Nobody, that's who pays you.

31:44.006 --> 31:46.741
Same as who pays you when you got
the downtime and the deadhead.

31:46.841 --> 31:51.045
When there's nothing in there, who's
your partner? He makes you his partner.

31:51.145 --> 31:53.915
When it's time to give
the ham-and-eggers a Christmas bonus,

31:54.015 --> 31:57.698
does he make you his partner then? No.
I'll tell you when he makes you a partner...

32:08.915 --> 32:14.303
- You armed? You packin'?
- Always, Jimmy. Always.

32:14.403 --> 32:18.105
- Don't lighten up on me now.
- Oh, no.

32:18.205 --> 32:21.239
I'm serious, Bobby.

32:21.339 --> 32:27.014
- Did I get to be this old?
- You got the piece stashed at the roadhouse?

32:27.114 --> 32:29.500
Can you get to it?

32:32.706 --> 32:35.106
You wanna go check it?

32:37.477 --> 32:42.730
- I'll check it if you need that, but it's there.
- Go check it.

32:42.830 --> 32:45.808
Where the fuck's D'Allesandro?

32:47.220 --> 32:49.537
I don't know.

32:49.637 --> 32:53.976
- Why don't you call him up?
- He ain't gonna be in.

32:54.076 --> 32:57.142
Call him up. Where is he?

32:57.242 --> 33:03.248
What the fuck? I'm sitting here fuckin'
shotgun for a simple meeting, fuckin' guy.

33:03.348 --> 33:07.886
- I'm sorry he ain't here.
- You fuckin' wops.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.965
You people.

33:10.977 --> 33:15.744
You cocksucker, why you wanna be
born into a race like that?

33:16.750 --> 33:20.584
- Bad judgment.
- You're fuckin' A well told.

33:24.191 --> 33:29.843
You go sit, look out the roadhouse, huh?
The booth the meeting's supposed to be.

33:29.943 --> 33:35.391
Call the motherfucker. Tell me.
Thing is, I'm not sitting here all day.

33:36.603 --> 33:39.868
- I'll call him.
- Leave me the piece.

33:41.575 --> 33:44.555
- I'm gonna go naked?
- You got the one at the roadhouse.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.635
What are you worried about?

33:51.485 --> 33:55.819
Get outta here. Do something for a living.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.994
Blew a fucking rod
and busted through the fan belt.

34:23.094 --> 34:26.780
I'm supposed to be in Cleveland four o'clock.

34:27.788 --> 34:31.815
I know. What am I, a fucking idiot? I know.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.159
The booth.

34:35.909 --> 34:40.378
Excuse me. There's a big sign -
"booth reserved."

34:40.478 --> 34:42.581
- What?
- Way it is.

34:42.681 --> 34:47.090
- OK, come on. I was just going, anyway.
- Sorry.

34:47.190 --> 34:50.337
- One coffee here, two to go.
- You got it.

34:52.478 --> 34:57.664
Will you give me a fucking break?
Hey, hey, look. Get it out to me, OK?

34:57.764 --> 35:00.914
Because I can't move
my fucking rig without it.

35:10.230 --> 35:15.224
Look, just get it to me.
Would you just get it to me?

35:17.003 --> 35:22.087
Hey, I need it. I need it.
Would I call if I didn't need it? I need it.

35:22.187 --> 35:26.236
Hey, look, just tell him
I'll get back to him, all right? When?

35:28.448 --> 35:31.333
Five minutes. Five minutes. Thank you.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.233
Fuck you.

35:36.723 --> 35:41.717
- I need that back in five minutes.
- Fuck off outta here. I'm busy.

36:08.555 --> 36:11.536
Yeah. This is Bobby Ciaro.

36:11.636 --> 36:14.341
Sal, where is he?

36:14.441 --> 36:19.444
Because I'm asking. Because
I'm sitting out here to meet with the fella.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.613
When was that?

36:21.713 --> 36:24.192
Well, then, where is he?

36:25.939 --> 36:29.758
If he calls, you give him the 7488 number,
the booth, the roadhouse.

36:29.858 --> 36:33.142
And we're waiting,
but we aren't gonna wait all day.

36:38.218 --> 36:40.880
You can't use it, son. I'm sorry.

36:43.390 --> 36:46.223
Who the fuck are you?

36:47.227 --> 36:49.957
Excuse me, will you?
You're blocking the view.

36:57.203 --> 36:59.603
Who are you?

37:00.019 --> 37:03.908
- You a union driver?
- Yeah, I'm a union driver.

37:09.382 --> 37:11.873
That's who I am.

37:22.362 --> 37:25.024
That's who the fuck I am.

37:40.113 --> 37:46.699
Wait a minute. I am a man with a legitimate
grievance and a legitimate position.

37:46.799 --> 37:50.206
I'm here in the legitimate interest
of my fellow Teamsters

37:50.306 --> 37:53.771
and my fellow drivers, who,
under the law, have a right to elect...

37:53.871 --> 37:56.008
You say legitimate?

37:56.108 --> 38:00.314
Your people, for the last six weeks,
have tied up this entire nation...

38:00.414 --> 38:02.216
- My people?
- Your people.

38:02.316 --> 38:04.484
My people? What about your people?

38:04.584 --> 38:10.690
The over-the-road drivers have a right
to a decent wage, to representation...

38:10.790 --> 38:14.725
- President Roosevelt had decreed...
- Hey. I'm an American citizen,

38:14.825 --> 38:19.634
but President Roosevelt,
in all due respect to him, don't make the laws.

38:19.734 --> 38:22.381
And neither do the newspapers.

38:23.957 --> 38:26.876
When President Roosevelt
and when the newspapers

38:26.976 --> 38:32.330
are hired by the Teamsters to replace me,
then I will abide by your opinion.

38:33.066 --> 38:35.762
Wait a minute. Would you wait one minute?

38:39.272 --> 38:41.763
Get the fuck out of my way.

38:47.147 --> 38:51.365
- Will the president send in the troops?
- Are the Teamsters gonna back down?

38:51.465 --> 38:55.669
The Teamsters are not gonna back down.

38:55.769 --> 38:58.837
We have been out six weeks.
We can stay out 600.

38:58.937 --> 39:04.509
And we will prevail because of the strength
of our almost one million members

39:04.609 --> 39:09.113
in the organization of the Railway Transport
Agency and in the improvement...

39:09.213 --> 39:13.819
Am I going too fast for you?
Of the living conditions of their working men.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.055
I believe the correct place to negotiate...

39:16.155 --> 39:19.893
I don't give a shit what you believe.
We are working men,

39:19.993 --> 39:24.563
and the law of the land says that
we have the right to collective bargaining.

39:24.663 --> 39:28.503
I have men that I am responsible to
that have sent me here to negotiate.

39:28.603 --> 39:33.976
I sit in a room and I am told
"Take it or leave it" for the last three months.

39:34.076 --> 39:38.913
I say I leave it. I cannot accept an offer
that I am not empowered to accept.

39:39.013 --> 39:42.384
And you throw the president in my face.

39:42.484 --> 39:46.405
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm gonna tell it to you straight...

39:51.111 --> 39:53.545
And who are the Secret Service?

39:57.917 --> 40:00.633
They are the Pinkertons of old.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.469
- Jim?
- They are...

40:02.569 --> 40:05.806
I don't think a lot of guys know
who the Pinkertons are.

40:05.906 --> 40:09.339
Are you fucking writing this?
You wanna write this?

40:09.439 --> 40:13.315
- Jimmy...
- Get him outta here. Get outta here, Pete.

40:13.415 --> 40:16.318
- Jimmy, telephone call.
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

40:16.418 --> 40:20.451
- It's Dan Tobin.
- Did I say I don't wanna talk to nobody?

40:20.551 --> 40:24.724
- Did I say who I did wanna talk to?
- He says he needs to talk to you.

40:24.824 --> 40:27.493
- Get outta here.
- He says he needs to talk to you.

40:27.593 --> 40:32.332
All right. Give me that phone.
Hello. Dan?

40:32.432 --> 40:36.968
No? What the fuck am I gonna do?
I gotta hold out.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.868
Dan. Dan.

40:39.237 --> 40:42.144
Dan, they're giving me nothing that I...

40:42.244 --> 40:44.011
The membersh...

40:44.111 --> 40:46.577
Listen. Listen.

40:46.677 --> 40:50.282
Listen, they're gonna... They're gonna cave.

40:50.382 --> 40:53.134
Give me another week, and I...

40:54.140 --> 40:59.156
You wanna run this local, come down here.
You wanna unseat me? You tell me.

40:59.256 --> 41:02.180
Barring that... Barring that...

41:19.365 --> 41:22.801
Jimmy, what does Tobin want?

41:23.970 --> 41:25.950
What's he want?

41:26.050 --> 41:29.099
He wants the president to like him.

41:30.109 --> 41:32.392
Wants me to call off the march tonight.

41:32.492 --> 41:34.728
Wants me to settle RTA.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.805
Don't you got to?

41:37.750 --> 41:41.102
He wants to run this local,
he can come down here.

41:41.202 --> 41:43.403
He wants to replace me, let him do that.

41:43.503 --> 41:46.740
- If Tobin says...
- Yeah, yeah.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.226
Can you get me there?

41:50.597 --> 41:54.280
If Dan Tobin wants to tell me
something that I don't know...

41:54.380 --> 41:59.417
- Come down. I'll listen to him.
- Yeah, you're right, Jimmy. You're right.

41:59.517 --> 42:04.488
When the president of the United States
comes out against the working man...

42:04.588 --> 42:08.525
- The fucking local is a ship upon the sea.
- Right, Jim.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.015
The man on board...

42:13.353 --> 42:15.366
Can you get me there?

42:15.466 --> 42:17.685
- Yes, sir.
- Pick it up, Petey.

42:18.825 --> 42:21.176
Get down. Get down.

42:21.276 --> 42:23.578
Stay down. Stay down.

42:23.678 --> 42:25.528
Who the fuck is it?

42:31.070 --> 42:33.061
Looks like the fucking safety patrol.

42:36.075 --> 42:38.088
- I'll go talk to 'em.
- Where you going?

42:38.188 --> 42:40.427
- Give me the umbrella.
- Where you going?

42:40.527 --> 42:42.127
- Don't worry.
- I got him.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.683
- Keep 'em covered.
- Stay down.

43:20.453 --> 43:25.447
Said there's gonna be an ambush.
Course there's gonna be an ambush.

44:17.176 --> 44:20.561
- Always good to see you out here.
- How you doing, Jimmy?

44:20.661 --> 44:23.661
- Jimmy.
- We're getting to 'em now.

44:23.761 --> 44:26.533
We're getting to 'em now. That's right.

44:26.633 --> 44:29.504
- You marching on 'em tonight?
- We're working on that.

44:29.604 --> 44:31.568
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

44:31.668 --> 44:33.974
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Jim, Jim, message.

44:34.074 --> 44:36.573
Call Dan Tobin, New York,
right away, this number.

44:36.673 --> 44:39.114
- All right.
- He says hold off the march.

44:39.214 --> 44:41.678
- Thank you.
- He says the mood of the newspapers...

44:41.778 --> 44:44.484
Am I fuckin' deaf?
I heard you. Get back in the line.

44:44.584 --> 44:46.718
- Go get 'em, Jim.
- I will, don't worry.

44:46.818 --> 44:50.788
I'm gonna get 'em, all right.
Fellas, good to see you out here.

44:50.888 --> 44:54.797
You're doing a good job. Doing a good job.

44:54.897 --> 44:57.861
They're gonna cave in, don't you worry.

44:57.961 --> 45:00.464
How are you, kid? Hey, Bob, how you doing?

45:00.564 --> 45:03.973
I've been good. Good to see ya.
How's it going? Huh?

45:04.073 --> 45:08.140
- I been better.
- You holding up? Family eating?

45:08.240 --> 45:11.112
- Eating something.
- Uh-huh.

45:11.212 --> 45:13.649
Been better fed.

45:13.749 --> 45:17.349
People out here, they wanna hold out
or they wanna go back in?

45:17.449 --> 45:21.655
Lot of people in the union, even,
they say take the offer, go back in.

45:21.755 --> 45:23.155
Uh-huh.

45:23.522 --> 45:27.660
- I'm Jimmy Hoffa.
- I know who you are.

45:27.760 --> 45:33.601
International wants me to call the strike off.
Cops say there's gonna be violence.

45:33.701 --> 45:36.678
What do you think I should do?

45:38.758 --> 45:42.908
Don't make a difference what I say. You're
gonna do what you figure you got to do.

45:43.008 --> 45:46.111
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

45:46.211 --> 45:48.583
Ain't that what we pay you for?

45:48.683 --> 45:53.752
- What's the kid's name?
- Does it make a difference?

45:53.852 --> 45:58.174
- No, it don't.
- They're all called something, aren't they?

45:59.112 --> 46:01.444
Indeed they are.

46:03.349 --> 46:07.134
- Attaboy, Jimmy.
- Thank you.

46:07.234 --> 46:09.469
- Mr. Hoffa, we ready?
- Huh?

46:09.569 --> 46:12.305
- We ready to march?
- Yeah, we're ready.

46:12.405 --> 46:15.608
I don't think
they're gonna do a goddamn thing.

46:15.708 --> 46:21.691
- Do you? What do they gain by violence?
- Yeah, that's a good one, all right.

46:22.835 --> 46:27.534
We're ready. It's time, Mr. Hoffa. It's time.

46:31.911 --> 46:34.363
What you gonna do, Jimmy?

46:34.463 --> 46:38.884
Don't you think we better call it off?
If Tobin says call it off, don't you gotta?

46:40.186 --> 46:41.386
Jimmy.

46:48.227 --> 46:49.592
Stay down. Stay down.

46:55.001 --> 46:56.468
Fuck me.

46:58.738 --> 47:02.624
If Tobin, the president, newspapers,
everybody else in the world says I'm wrong,

47:02.724 --> 47:05.370
I gotta be right. All right.

47:06.512 --> 47:09.959
- Brothers.
- Yeah.

47:10.059 --> 47:13.131
- Brothers, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

47:13.231 --> 47:16.700
Look at them up there,
sitting on their fat asses,

47:16.800 --> 47:18.984
drinking coffee and eating doughnuts.

47:20.960 --> 47:25.043
- Have you had enough of it?
- Yeah.

47:25.143 --> 47:28.259
We're gonna march on the RTA headquarters.

47:31.537 --> 47:35.132
We're gonna demand that
they recognize the Teamsters.

47:37.343 --> 47:40.228
We are gonna hold together in good order,

47:40.328 --> 47:44.306
and we are gonna get
what we came down here for.

47:48.187 --> 47:53.136
Let's get over there. Come on. That's right.

47:53.236 --> 47:55.442
I'm sick to death of them. Come on.

47:55.542 --> 48:00.179
- Mr. Hoffa, are we gonna win this strike?
- Mister, we have won this strike.

48:00.279 --> 48:04.965
We won it the minute we
started across this railroad yard.

48:06.572 --> 48:08.972
Move back, boys.

48:12.912 --> 48:14.295
The right to organize, eh?

48:14.395 --> 48:17.406
Fuck their right to organize.
These cocksuckers shot at me.

48:24.457 --> 48:27.938
- You could've anticipated...
- In every conflict there are casualties.

48:28.038 --> 48:31.278
The question is, what has been lost
and what has been gained?

48:31.378 --> 48:33.764
- What about...
- Make the rest of it up yourself.

49:03.329 --> 49:05.559
Hey. Get these guys.

49:23.382 --> 49:25.373
Come on, boys.

50:03.089 --> 50:05.906
- Joey.
- Mom. Mom.

50:06.006 --> 50:09.776
- Mom.
- Joey. Joey.

50:09.876 --> 50:12.179
- Mom.
- Joey.

50:12.279 --> 50:15.149
- Mommy.
- Joey.

50:15.249 --> 50:18.499
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

50:20.840 --> 50:25.470
Come on, you scabs.
Come on, you fuck, come on.

50:27.179 --> 50:31.548
- Come on, let's tip this fuckin' thing over.
- Push the fuckin' thing over.

50:40.092 --> 50:42.151
Mommy. Mommy.

50:43.996 --> 50:45.196
Mommy.

50:49.135 --> 50:52.002
Over here. Over here. I got him.

50:54.740 --> 50:57.072
- Get him off me.
- Come on, come on.

52:11.517 --> 52:14.975
.. who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

52:15.754 --> 52:19.702
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

52:19.802 --> 52:23.211
on earth as it is in heaven.

52:23.311 --> 52:27.080
Give us this day our daily bread,

52:27.180 --> 52:29.882
and forgive us our trespasses

52:29.982 --> 52:34.288
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

52:34.388 --> 52:40.160
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.260
Amen.

52:51.090 --> 52:55.539
Lord, we wanna pray
for the people who have fallen.

52:55.639 --> 53:00.048
For their men who fell.
For their children, Lord,

53:00.148 --> 53:07.004
who must carry on with the knowledge
that their fathers fell in a just cause.

53:08.207 --> 53:12.627
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

53:12.727 --> 53:18.695
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

53:18.795 --> 53:23.334
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

53:23.434 --> 53:27.654
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

53:32.164 --> 53:34.564
D'Alli's outside.

53:40.272 --> 53:42.900
You want anything?

54:35.761 --> 54:39.878
- Jimmy, I...
- Thank you, Fitz. Pete.

54:39.978 --> 54:41.578
We're...

54:42.281 --> 54:45.017
- We're so...
- I appreciate it.

54:45.117 --> 54:48.551
- I'm really sorry, James.
- Thank you.

54:48.651 --> 54:52.892
We are left with this. For unto them...

54:52.992 --> 54:56.459
- This meat is very good.
- Thank you, Frankie.

54:56.559 --> 55:02.566
- James R, is there anything that I can do?
- Yeah. Bring my wife a sandwich.

55:02.666 --> 55:07.705
- .. praise the Lord...
- Some fuckin' Mick on a podium.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.943
- isn't it?
- .. delivered the soul of the poor

55:11.043 --> 55:13.999
from the hands of the evildoers.

55:28.714 --> 55:30.909
- D'Alli.
- Jimmy.

55:32.718 --> 55:34.982
Thanks for coming.

55:36.488 --> 55:40.307
Nothing's ever settled by violence.

55:40.407 --> 55:42.986
I heard that before.

55:55.340 --> 55:59.226
They're always looking to you, aren't they?

55:59.326 --> 56:01.926
Yeah. "What do we do?"

56:02.026 --> 56:04.663
"What do we do now?"

56:04.763 --> 56:07.810
"What do we do next?"

56:13.192 --> 56:15.854
No one pardons us, Jimmy.

56:16.862 --> 56:19.854
If they could, we wouldn't let 'em.

56:21.567 --> 56:26.561
They'd rather some people die
through your mistake,

56:28.107 --> 56:30.769
than that they lived

56:32.311 --> 56:34.575
but that they lacked a leader.

56:42.020 --> 56:44.853
We got things to do.

57:08.714 --> 57:11.706
He was such a good boy.

57:14.386 --> 57:20.382
From the bottom of my heart, I wish
I could change places with him, Mrs. Innes.

57:36.008 --> 57:37.008
Yeah?

57:40.279 --> 57:41.479
Bobby.

57:41.925 --> 57:44.596
Where the fuck...?

57:44.696 --> 57:47.833
Well, where is he?

57:47.933 --> 57:50.839
Well, why don't you know?

57:50.939 --> 57:53.206
Where's D'Al...

57:53.306 --> 57:58.423
No. Hey, baby, we got a meet,
and where is he? Find him.

58:05.070 --> 58:07.732
Black. Two. Give 'em to me.

58:14.213 --> 58:17.182
- Waiting?
- What?

58:18.383 --> 58:21.511
- Waiting?
- Yeah, that's right.

58:32.030 --> 58:35.978
Blew a fuckin' torque rod.
I'm sitting here eating it.

58:36.078 --> 58:38.683
Told me he'd get it to me four hours ago.
I'm waiting.

58:38.783 --> 58:40.863
That's rough.

58:42.107 --> 58:45.059
I want you to do me a favour.
That phone rings, whoever it is,

58:45.159 --> 58:47.927
say "He'll be right back."
I'm running out to the car.

58:48.027 --> 58:49.878
- Black. Two.
- There you go.

58:51.950 --> 58:55.499
- Union business?
- Yeah, that's what it is.

58:55.599 --> 58:58.112
I'm going out to the car. I'll be right back.

58:58.557 --> 59:01.273
What's at the car?

59:01.373 --> 59:04.678
What's at the car is my guy.
What's in here is you watching the phone.

59:04.778 --> 59:09.359
You help me out, I'll make a phone call,
I'll get somebody to shoot you out that rod.

59:10.335 --> 59:12.132
Who's your guy?

59:13.572 --> 59:15.972
So who's your guy?

59:17.509 --> 59:21.741
Who's your guy that all the time
you gotta run to him?

59:22.748 --> 59:26.797
What's wrong with just staying here?

59:26.897 --> 59:32.402
- I like you so much.
- I like you, too. You're fine.

59:32.502 --> 59:35.809
Oh, fuck. What I am is I'm late.

59:35.909 --> 59:39.330
There's a time to shirk and a time to work.

59:46.471 --> 59:50.066
- Here.
- I don't want your money.

59:51.677 --> 59:55.374
I didn't go with you because of the money.

59:56.982 --> 01:00:00.383
Don't forget what you said.
I'll be back a few hours.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.339
- Jim.
- Bobby.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:46.313
I got news.
He said he'd have to go with Test Fleet.

01:00:46.413 --> 01:00:49.249
- He'll lease 20 trucks from you.
- He said he'd go?

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:54.317
As it was laid down with what we said we'd
do, what he said he'd do, that he'd do it.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:59.091
Good. Sign him up Test Fleet,
and send him my thanks,

01:00:59.191 --> 01:01:02.692
and send him a bottle of...

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:05.998
- What's that shanty Irish prick drink?
- Crown Royal.

01:01:06.098 --> 01:01:10.803
All right, send it to him,
and send him a little note with it, says:

01:01:10.903 --> 01:01:14.404
"A good business deal benefits all."

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.504
Ah,

01:01:15.774 --> 01:01:17.808
just tell him I said thanks.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:21.248
- D'Alli, how are you?
- How's your wife?

01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.380
- She's good.
- How's your boy?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.448
He's good.

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:28.984
- How's your new kitchen coming along?
- It's costing me an arm and a leg.

01:01:29.084 --> 01:01:31.222
- You should do it yourself.
- I am.

01:01:31.322 --> 01:01:33.937
That's how come it's so goddamn expensive.

01:01:36.348 --> 01:01:40.768
Nobody says fuckin' nothin' about
anythin' to do with fuckin' business, right?

01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:43.270
Right, Jimmy. No business, no business.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:48.019
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Right. We're just gonna relax, take it easy.

01:01:50.562 --> 01:01:52.946
We loan it out. 20 million.

01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:57.682
You take the breakage of a half point,
plow it back, skim it, give it to the dog.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:02:01.453
- How do I plow it back?
- You take your pension fund...

01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:05.359
- What are you gonna whack your guys?
- What am I gonna whack 'em?

01:02:05.459 --> 01:02:09.926
My idea of the pension fund,
even each guy 100 bucks a year.

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:12.833
Bear with me. Whatever. You're now the bank.

01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:15.066
- I'm with you.
- You got your notes out?

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:20.989
What notes?
Fitz, give me a pencil. Hold this.

01:02:23.095 --> 01:02:26.278
You give us control straight up,
we'll start off 20 million.

01:02:26.378 --> 01:02:28.512
- 20 million.
- We'll loan it out.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.898
Give me a piece of paper.

01:02:31.903 --> 01:02:36.533
20 million loan. Go a little slower.
I need notes. Write it out.

01:02:41.012 --> 01:02:43.695
- I'll make it simple.
- All right. Go ahead.

01:02:43.795 --> 01:02:45.773
All right. Look.

01:02:48.253 --> 01:02:51.104
You take your 20 mil. We're gonna put it out.

01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:54.873
- We pay five points. That's one mil a year.
- One mil.

01:02:54.973 --> 01:02:58.075
- Two and a half points, that's 25 grand.
- On top the mil?

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:02.848
- Perfectly legit. Call it a service charge.
- Now, the rate goes up, the loan goes up.

01:03:02.948 --> 01:03:05.617
The rate goes up, loans go up,
everything goes up.

01:03:05.717 --> 01:03:08.104
Same two and a half?

01:03:10.709 --> 01:03:13.189
Let me go back.

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:16.393
- We're going to Nevada.
- Going Nevada.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.494
The down, 20 mil.

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:23.066
Teamsters getting, I'm talking basically,
three streams of income,

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.737
which all are, mind you, legal.
They're all legal.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:29.575
Your money, four and one half per cent.

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:31.843
- That yearly?
- Yearly, of the total.

01:03:31.943 --> 01:03:33.881
- Yearly.
- Yearly.

01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:37.581
- All right, you say the points...
- Just let me finish.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.251
One - four and one half per cent of the total.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.319
Basically.

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.019
As what?

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:50.059
Two and a half service charge
and the one and a half as what?

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.296
- Let me finish.
- All right.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:58.186
- This is the same two and a half plus the...
- No, no, let me finish.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:06.522
Fuckin' crazy.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.093
Go ahead. Get up, Fitz. The fighting's over.

01:04:23.682 --> 01:04:27.799
Four percent. Listen to what I'm telling you.
Different scenario, OK?

01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:31.305
- Two and a half and four, say 40.
- That's the one and a half...

01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:33.414
- No, different scenario...
- Beautiful.

01:04:35.093 --> 01:04:40.576
This goombah, this guinea,
reaches under his coat, takes out his piece.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.860
Kaboom. There goes the deer.

01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:46.116
Can't even hunt for shooting targets.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.152
Ya-boom, ya-boom, ya-boom.
Great outdoorsman.

01:04:50.252 --> 01:04:54.027
- Have to go over some of your testimony.
- All I'll do is tell the truth.

01:04:54.127 --> 01:04:58.446
- You shot a deer in cold blood?
- He pulled a knife on me.

01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:01.702
This goombah... Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:01.802 --> 01:05:06.235
This goombah is reaching around
in his pockets. Can't nobody find a knife.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:10.975
He takes out a nail file.
He's skinning a deer with a nail file.

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:14.948
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Please let me through.

01:05:15.048 --> 01:05:16.450
Hold it, buddy.

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:19.867
I have a very important message
for James R Hoffa.

01:05:21.239 --> 01:05:23.219
Not much huntin' he'd done up till here.

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:25.788
- James. James R.
- Just a minute.

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:29.527
So hardly it occurs to me to ask him,
heart in my throat:

01:05:29.627 --> 01:05:33.629
"Bobby, where did you learn to skin?"

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:38.302
- James, I have a very important message.
- I'm tellin' a story.

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:44.374
I'm tellin' a story. It's a very important
message to you, you understand, not to me.

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:46.914
It's not that important to me at this moment.

01:05:47.014 --> 01:05:48.578
- OK.
- OK?

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:52.052
- Just a second.
- All right, I'll tell you later.

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:54.537
Washington. So...

01:05:57.342 --> 01:06:00.294
Come to order. Everybody take a seat, please.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:05.232
I lost my train of thought. More about
the great outdoors after the ladies' lunch.

01:06:05.332 --> 01:06:08.534
- How's it gonna go?
- How's it gonna go? I'm gonna win.

01:06:08.634 --> 01:06:14.581
Right will prevail.
This mooch. Why doesn't he get a job?

01:06:15.994 --> 01:06:19.177
Trying to make a reputation for himself.

01:06:19.277 --> 01:06:22.278
Wants a reputation?
Why doesn't he rob a bank?

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.617
Someday you gonna organize the cops?

01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:29.140
Hey, that's easy. Someday I'm gonna
organize the crooks, then we all sit down.

01:06:31.009 --> 01:06:32.555
Mr. Hoffa?

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.826
Nice suit, Jimmy.

01:06:34.926 --> 01:06:38.833
Well, Jo got it for me.
Didn't want me to look bad

01:06:38.933 --> 01:06:41.566
next to the Senate committee
and their lawyers.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:45.282
Mr. Hoffa. Please take your seat.

01:06:46.157 --> 01:06:47.957
Sister M.

01:06:49.294 --> 01:06:53.128
- Frankie eating all his spinach?
- Can you believe it?

01:06:56.835 --> 01:06:58.826
Mr. Chairman...

01:06:59.738 --> 01:07:03.989
Mr. Chairman, I would like to apologize
for delaying these proceedings.

01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:07.943
- On the night of March 13th...
- Excuse me. Was I interrupting you?

01:07:09.247 --> 01:07:14.764
- I thought you'd finished.
- No, I was just expressing a thought.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.801
It was of no consequence.
You go on with what you had to say.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:22.872
All right. All right. Well, then,

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:25.555
why don't we talk about Joe Holtzman?

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.665
- He was a close friend of yours?
- I knew Joe Holtzman.

01:07:31.836 --> 01:07:35.317
- He was a close friend of yours?
- I knew Joe Holtzman.

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:39.388
- He was a close friend of yours?
- Now, just a moment, Bob.

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:43.709
I said I knew Joe Holtzman.
He wasn't any particular friend of mine.

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:49.133
Your turn, Bobby.

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:51.233
Mr. Hoffa,

01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:55.606
would you allow, as a Teamster official,

01:07:55.706 --> 01:07:58.809
a man who is a Communist?

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:02.046
We don't have any Communists
in our Teamsters...

01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:05.648
- Just answer the question, please.
- Just a moment, if you will.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.820
That I know of. But if the membership saw fit

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.694
to elect a man who had been tagged -
tagged, mind you, as a Communist -

01:08:14.794 --> 01:08:18.294
and no proof was presented
under our constitution,

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:22.365
and you don't have to read it to me
because I helped write the article,

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:29.040
we would be not allowed to discharge him
from his elected position.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.142
is there any question in your mind

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:37.983
that Mr. Bridges and Goldblatt
are Communists, Mr. Hoffa?

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:40.684
I don't know whether they are or not.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.287
I'm not dealing with Khrushchev,
I'm dealing with Goldblatt.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:48.424
I deal with Goldblatt the way our Secretary
Herter would deal with Khrushchev -

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:52.332
on the basis of what is good for
the American worker, the American citizen.

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:55.875
- I'm not in bed with him.
- Well, I...

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:01.703
- I don't think that the comparison holds.
- That's what you think.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:07.715
The fact that Mr. Bridges has ties with
the Communist party leaders of the world.

01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:13.817
Mr. Goldblatt is identified repeatedly as an
important member of the Communist party.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:17.555
These people are leaders of a local
with whom you made an alliance.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:21.122
I don't know if Harry Bridges
is a Democrat... Excuse me.

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:26.397
I don't know if Bridges is a Communist
or if Goldblatt is a Communist.

01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:30.837
This is not the issue
under the question of transportation unity,

01:09:30.937 --> 01:09:37.041
but they're elected under the free democratic
process of America and the Taft-Hartley laws.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.346
Mr. Goldblatt filed for 10 years, according
to his testimony, non-Communist affidavits.

01:09:42.447 --> 01:09:45.616
You think it's wrong, you investigate that.

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:51.625
There is no question about Mr. Goldblatt.
There can be a question about Mr. Hoffa...

01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:54.960
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.763
Just a moment. Don't you say anything
about a question about Hoffa.

01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:02.331
There is no question about Hoffa,
and don't you say that either.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:06.137
Don't you say that I'm a Communist
or even affiliated with one.

01:10:06.237 --> 01:10:10.543
You said that enough around this country,
and I want the American press to know

01:10:10.643 --> 01:10:15.049
that I resent the fact that there is
any inference that I am a Communist,

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:18.052
that I am associated with
or controlled by Communists,

01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:22.185
and don't you use this as a sounding board
for headlines for that purpose.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.990
And I appeal to the chair that
that be taken out of the record,

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:31.431
and that nobody cast any aspersions
about my loyalty to this country.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.900
I object to that.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.304
I'll straighten the record out. I was talking
about Mr. Bridges and Mr. Goldblatt.

01:10:38.404 --> 01:10:41.870
- Don't put me in their class, then.
- Did you put him in their class?

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:48.478
No, I just said that although there might be
some question about Mr. Hoffa...

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:52.851
Instead of... What I said was
"Hoffa" instead of "Mr. Bridges".

01:10:52.951 --> 01:10:57.656
What I meant to say was that although there
might be some question about Mr. Bridges,

01:10:57.756 --> 01:11:00.424
there is no question about Mr. Goldblatt.

01:11:00.524 --> 01:11:04.459
- Evidently, you agree with the same thing.
- Just one moment...

01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:08.401
You agree, otherwise you wouldn't
have said "Don't put me in their class."

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:11.304
Don't put me in their class that they're tagged.

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:16.973
In a class that they're tagged, I said.
But I want to have, if you will, sir,

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:21.346
the record cleared that there are
no aspersions made in any way

01:11:21.446 --> 01:11:26.882
that I am associated with or controlled
or any part of the Communist party.

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:29.924
I resent it, sir.

01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:33.123
All right. All right.

01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:35.427
We refer now

01:11:35.527 --> 01:11:38.175
to the pension fund.

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:43.247
To your stewardship, we could say,
to your creation of same.

01:11:44.856 --> 01:11:49.473
In amassing these funds,
this war chest, this unholy war chest...

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:52.642
Mr. Kennedy, you have used
this term "a war chest",

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:55.182
to which you have now added "unholy"...

01:11:55.282 --> 01:11:57.279
- Wait a minute...
- If I may finish.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:12:01.805
You may finish in a moment, sir.
When I am done, then you may finish.

01:12:03.975 --> 01:12:07.861
The movement of organized crime
into the ranks of labour,

01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:11.229
the corruption of leading Teamster officials
with gangsters...

01:12:11.329 --> 01:12:15.479
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.
If I might. Point of order. If I might.

01:12:19.957 --> 01:12:26.408
It is unfair to allow this impression to exist
publicly, as it's created by these hearings,

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:29.125
that I am controlled by gangsters.

01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:32.716
I am not controlled by 'em.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:37.286
I would be very sympathetic
if it wasn't for a fact you got people in Detroit,

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:42.060
at least 15 who have police records.
You've got Joey Glimco in Chicago.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.296
I say you're not tough enough
to get rid of these people.

01:12:45.396 --> 01:12:48.932
I don't intend to be tough.
I don't wanna be tough.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:53.821
I intend to follow the constitution of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

01:12:54.592 --> 01:13:00.610
We're talking about the vicious cooption
of the field of labour, and you sit there, sir,

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.617
who have single-handedly
created this monster,

01:13:03.717 --> 01:13:07.683
who have forged this bond
with improper, with criminal activity...

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:11.658
If it please the committee,
my client has been convicted of nothing.

01:13:11.758 --> 01:13:14.902
He hasn't been convicted, but he will.

01:13:15.947 --> 01:13:19.130
If James R Hoffa is acquitted,

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:23.017
I will jump from the Capitol dome.

01:13:28.392 --> 01:13:31.277
Aw, fuck it. Hey, I'll answer their questions.

01:13:31.377 --> 01:13:35.945
Where... This little piece of shit.
Yeah, I made a pension fund.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:39.149
For the benefit of who, Paul?
For the benefit of who, huh?

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:42.853
He couldn't find a working man
if you drew him a diagram.

01:13:42.953 --> 01:13:46.325
This little fuck born with a dick in his mouth.

01:13:46.425 --> 01:13:49.059
Mr. Hoffa, do you have a statement?

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:53.067
Bob Kennedy seems sure of himself.
He's gonna jump from the Capitol dome.

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.469
Bob Kennedy, Robert Kennedy,
whatever you wanna call him,

01:13:56.569 --> 01:13:59.270
has an exaggerated sense of
his own entertainment value.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:03.907
He asserts your only motive in inaugurating
the pension fund was accumulating power.

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:10.316
The assertions that Mr. Kennedy propounds
here lack only the merit of being true.

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:16.053
This three-ring circus, the newspapers and
the TV and the media and all the rest of it,

01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:19.222
is designed and intended
to bring him to the public eye.

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:22.825
To bring him to the public eye.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:26.097
And what has this law clerk done
with his little vendetta

01:14:26.197 --> 01:14:30.002
except picking on the working man?

01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:34.069
in my opinion, it's union busting.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:37.753
That's what it is,
and nothing more elegant than that.

01:14:38.329 --> 01:14:40.781
Hoffa will be acquitted,

01:14:40.881 --> 01:14:47.737
because Hoffa is innocent of the vicious and
unsubstantiated charges that face me here.

01:14:48.506 --> 01:14:52.392
And then Bobby Kennedy
can jump off the Capitol dome,

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:56.193
or whatever else he thinks
will bring him to the public eye at that time.

01:14:56.293 --> 01:14:59.930
That's all I got to say.

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:01.699
- Jimmy.
- Yeah. I hear you.

01:15:01.799 --> 01:15:06.538
- Hey, Jimmy, we're with you.
- How are you, Pete?

01:15:06.638 --> 01:15:12.276
- Jimmy. Ted Harmon, Detroit News.
- I know who you are.

01:15:12.376 --> 01:15:15.783
These allegations will affect your run
for presidency of the Teamsters.

01:15:15.883 --> 01:15:18.948
How are these allegations gonna affect
my bid to become president

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:24.120
of the international Brotherhood
of Teamsters? That your question?

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.526
in my opinion,
the first ballot will be the last.

01:15:27.626 --> 01:15:32.431
You know, Ted,
the Detroit News, hometown paper.

01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:37.701
You'd think in a city built by the automotive
industry, I'd get a fair shake from the press.

01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:40.904
You guys been printing a lot
of detrimental stuff about me.

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:44.073
What can I tell you? We print it cos it's true.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:47.858
is that the thing?
Well, you go on printing it, then.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.816
- I wanted to ask you about Test Fleet.
- What is that?

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:57.352
- About your Test Fleet company.
- Yeah, uh-huh?

01:15:57.452 --> 01:16:01.969
About using Teamster muscle to compel
certain companies to lease trucks from you.

01:16:03.047 --> 01:16:05.161
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:09.000
We possess facts and figures
which establish that it is true.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:13.535
Well, you got those facts and figures.
Why haven't you run them, then?

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:18.687
- We plan to, next week.
- I'd be careful about that, I were you.

01:16:21.799 --> 01:16:26.984
See, as I said, this is something
of a volatile time, this time here.

01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:30.234
Hearings, elections coming up.

01:16:31.242 --> 01:16:36.703
If I was gonna print something,
I'd be oh-so-sure it was true.

01:16:38.049 --> 01:16:42.383
it is true. We're gonna run it.
I thank you for your reaction.

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:50.590
Ants to the picnic.

01:16:59.203 --> 01:17:02.785
Somebody ought to give that punk
a dose of reality.

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:05.792
Yeah. Somebody ought to give it to him.

01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:08.868
We're with you, Jimmy.

01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:16.832
The idea being, if it's got wheels,
it's in Teamster jurisdiction.

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.739
If you wanna organize,
you gotta be a fuckin' man.

01:17:19.839 --> 01:17:24.340
You don't go out there to run pussies
or to bring back an excuse.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.409
You wanna organize,
the guy says take names.

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.714
Do not take no for an answer,

01:17:29.814 --> 01:17:32.449
because if you will not take no for an answer,

01:17:32.549 --> 01:17:35.528
eventually the answer comes back yes.

01:17:38.142 --> 01:17:40.133
Get the shit.

01:17:44.148 --> 01:17:46.810
This it? Let's see it.

01:18:04.468 --> 01:18:07.028
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.931
Put the paper under it.

01:18:13.878 --> 01:18:16.358
- What was I saying?
- Billy.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:19.664
The most stand-up guy I ever met,
Billy Flynn,

01:18:19.764 --> 01:18:23.765
back when we were organizing the laundries.
Billy gonna light up this laundry.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:26.835
- Light it up?
- He's gonna firebomb it.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.742
They don't wanna come around or sign up.

01:18:29.842 --> 01:18:32.610
They never heard of the Teamsters.

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:37.848
Billy torches the joint. Too much fuel.
Burns up entire body. Dyin'.

01:18:37.948 --> 01:18:40.854
in the hospital, dyin'.

01:18:40.954 --> 01:18:43.120
Priest comes up. Give me the ribbon.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.127
Priest comes up...
Yeah, put your finger there.

01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:52.897
Priest: "My son,
confess the shit that you did."

01:18:52.997 --> 01:18:57.066
"Confess, and meet God
with a clean conscience."

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.520
Looks the priest in the eye.

01:19:00.524 --> 01:19:02.724
"Fuck you."

01:19:02.874 --> 01:19:05.745
His dyin' words.

01:19:05.845 --> 01:19:10.824
Never let down. Never let up. Never forget.

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.868
What's in the package?

01:19:15.873 --> 01:19:18.034
A guy's dick and balls.

01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:21.742
Get this shit. Come on.

01:19:28.419 --> 01:19:30.399
OK, read it back to me.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:35.842
"Successful in verifying on three occasions
the charges of bribery against James Hoffa."

01:19:35.942 --> 01:19:37.439
- Ted.
- "in light of..."

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.744
- Sure about that?
- Came for you.

01:19:39.844 --> 01:19:40.844
Yeah?

01:19:41.814 --> 01:19:45.348
"in light of which the attitude
of the Senate committee, although combative,

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:49.986
is both, it would seem,
justified and necessary."

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:55.341
"The power to organize does not and must
not include the power to coerce, either in..."

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.977
The boardroom, the courtroom, or the streets.

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:17.782
"The J&H Sales Company,
later called National Equipment,

01:20:17.882 --> 01:20:21.917
own trucks which deliver automobiles
on large, open racks."

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:25.121
This is prosaic enough,
if Hoffa did not feel guilt about it..."

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:27.526
Kill the story.

01:20:27.626 --> 01:20:32.674
- What?
- Kill the story. Kill the Hoffa story.

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:37.282
- I...
- Kill the fuckin' story.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.303
Vice president in charge of finance,
Jerome Dempsey.

01:20:59.476 --> 01:21:04.413
Vice president for planning, Jerry Laughlin.

01:21:06.984 --> 01:21:14.152
Our negotiating team,
Vice President Dave Miller and John Breen.

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:23.457
Head of the benevolent association,
John Patrick Deedy.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:31.437
Head of the finance committee, Billy Flaherty.

01:21:35.212 --> 01:21:39.329
The strengths, the depths

01:21:39.429 --> 01:21:46.686
which makes, which made
and which will make the international run.

01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:51.642
Join with me in welcoming to you

01:21:51.742 --> 01:21:56.312
and using for the first time that title,

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.150
the president...

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:04.989
president of
the international Brotherhood of Teamsters.

01:22:05.089 --> 01:22:07.373
James R Hoffa.

01:22:25.829 --> 01:22:30.828
Tomorrow morning, you go in,
you fire every one of these cocksuckers.

01:22:30.928 --> 01:22:31.928
What?

01:22:32.028 --> 01:22:35.888
You're gonna can a lot of people,
make sure you do it the first day.

01:22:35.988 --> 01:22:39.392
That way, the ones that are left
don't feel insecure, you see.

01:22:39.492 --> 01:22:42.457
What they feel is grateful.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:47.062
You do it all piecemeal,
they're gonna turn against you.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.142
Right, Jimmy.

01:22:53.324 --> 01:22:56.384
- You listen to this good.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:11.508 --> 01:23:12.708
Jimmy.

01:23:17.481 --> 01:23:20.143
Let's get as many as we can, Jo.

01:23:26.223 --> 01:23:28.851
Whoa. Here I go.

01:24:06.196 --> 01:24:08.687
- Here.
- Where is he?

01:24:11.068 --> 01:24:14.731
I called him at the club, the office, everybody.

01:24:15.839 --> 01:24:17.966
Where the fuck is he?

01:24:22.212 --> 01:24:24.703
Fuckin' cocksucker.

01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:31.218
- The money I made him. The guys.
- I know, JR.

01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:41.627
The fuckin' money I made that man.

01:24:42.966 --> 01:24:47.027
- Call him at Gold Club.
- I did. They don't know where he is.

01:24:52.309 --> 01:24:55.526
Call him that number in the back.
Equipment shed.

01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:57.944
The card game.

01:24:58.982 --> 01:25:02.713
Call him. He's coming or not.

01:25:06.223 --> 01:25:10.171
I don't wanna be sittin' here
till the fuckin' sun goes down.

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:13.680
- I understand.
- I don't wanna, Bobby.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.792
- Right.
- Not in the mood for no fuckin' bullshit.

01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:37.151
Gettin' old.

01:25:38.489 --> 01:25:44.826
Everybody gets old till they die.

01:25:58.942 --> 01:26:01.775
That look familiar?

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.420
Long time.

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:22.294
You've been with me a long time, Bobby.

01:26:25.936 --> 01:26:29.030
What the fuck else am I gonna do?

01:26:37.681 --> 01:26:43.677
- Where you going?
- To call the equipment shed.

01:26:51.061 --> 01:26:56.544
Stay in the car. I said, stay in the goddamn
car. Hands on the wheel, eyes straight ahead.

01:26:56.644 --> 01:27:00.018
- If you'll just...
- Are you listening to me?

01:27:00.118 --> 01:27:04.687
- You're doing 90, 50-mile zone.
- I'm in a hurry.

01:27:04.787 --> 01:27:08.458
That's a hell of a hurry. You got
something peculiar making you go that fast?

01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:09.558
I do.

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:16.118
Let me see your registration and your license.
Slowly. OK? Slowly.

01:27:17.187 --> 01:27:20.139
- Wanna tell me what it is?
- I work for James R Hoffa.

01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:22.248
The hell you say.

01:27:34.404 --> 01:27:37.168
- OK. Go right ahead.
- Thank you.

01:27:54.925 --> 01:27:59.345
I said nobody gets in. Fuck's the matter with
you? Someone waves a name in your face?

01:27:59.445 --> 01:28:02.247
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck I am is not important.

01:28:02.347 --> 01:28:04.784
I am here with a message
for somebody who's in there.

01:28:04.884 --> 01:28:07.950
A message from James R Hoffa.
I was instructed to...

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:12.020
I said nobody in. Nobody in.
I said I don't care.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.895
I don't care who you work for.
Screw this bullshit.

01:28:16.995 --> 01:28:21.576
Throw this fuckin' dago out of here.
This is my fuckin' club here, OK?

01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:25.867
- I told you, nobody gets in.
- I'm sorry.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:30.972
- I don't care who the fuckin' guy works for.
- You're gonna fuckin' care.

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:33.445
Down the stairs. Down the stairs.

01:28:33.545 --> 01:28:35.914
Are you insane?
Get this guy off of me.

01:28:36.014 --> 01:28:39.480
We're going in the back to look for a fella.
I was told he was here.

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.751
Six feet, black hair, fella from Detroit.

01:28:41.851 --> 01:28:44.386
- All I got is a message for him.
- You're dead.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.923
You'll be in Sheepshead Bay tonight, you
guinea bastard. Know who my friends are?

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:52.413
- You are fuckin' dead.
- Open the door.

01:28:56.219 --> 01:29:01.270
You know what this cocksucker did? Fuckin'
goombah comes in, puts a gun to my head...

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:04.541
Give me your piece.
Give me your piece. Cut him down.

01:29:04.641 --> 01:29:08.548
Cut this fucker down. Cut him down.

01:29:08.648 --> 01:29:12.383
I'm sorry to intrude.
I came here. I was sent by someone.

01:29:12.483 --> 01:29:15.916
I didn't wanna mention names.
I was instructed to give a note to you.

01:29:16.016 --> 01:29:20.792
- I'm very sorry you were put through this.
- Well, sorry is... Thank you.

01:29:20.892 --> 01:29:25.928
Sorry ain't enough. This is my club here.
Guy comes in, puts a gun to my head...

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.678
Hey, I'm not talking to you.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.511
He is like a brother to me,

01:29:34.965 --> 01:29:38.283
and should be treated with
the same respect with which you treat me.

01:29:38.383 --> 01:29:39.718
D'Alli...

01:29:39.818 --> 01:29:43.352
Did he say he was here
from our friend in Detroit?

01:29:43.452 --> 01:29:47.388
- He said that, yeah.
- Having said that, you told him what?

01:29:47.488 --> 01:29:52.073
- To get out? That this is your club?
- D'Alli, I...

01:29:53.183 --> 01:29:55.196
I had no idea that you'd...

01:29:55.296 --> 01:29:57.719
Thank you for making the trip.

01:29:58.889 --> 01:30:02.640
If there's anything you need here in New York,
Mr. Stein will be happy to...

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:06.708
D'Alli, on my knees, on my knees,
if I knew this man was a friend of yours...

01:30:06.808 --> 01:30:11.184
I'm sure if there's anything you need here
in New York, Mr. Stein would be most happy...

01:30:11.284 --> 01:30:15.717
Happy? I'd be honoured...
Honoured? I'd be delighted.

01:30:15.817 --> 01:30:18.624
Whatever I can do for the gentleman.
Anything.

01:30:18.724 --> 01:30:20.643
- Champagne, Sal.
- Champagne.

01:30:24.081 --> 01:30:29.502
James R? Nothing to it.
The note is delivered, the note is understood.

01:30:29.602 --> 01:30:34.873
The message is "thank you",
and I am in receipt of a package for you.

01:30:34.973 --> 01:30:38.951
Tomorrow. Tomorrow night.
You want me to...

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:42.721
You can spare me that long?

01:30:45.569 --> 01:30:46.969
Uh-huh.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:51.889
Nothing separates me from it,
you know that, boss.

01:30:51.989 --> 01:30:54.056
Thank you, boss.

01:30:54.156 --> 01:30:58.604
I'm gonna see you Wednesday, then.
Thank you, boss. Right.

01:31:04.788 --> 01:31:07.882
- Hi, Jackie.
- Bobby.

01:31:15.599 --> 01:31:17.430
You wanna know what's in there?

01:31:17.701 --> 01:31:19.349
A heart of pure fuckin' gold.

01:31:19.449 --> 01:31:21.449
I don't care. Give me wops.

01:31:21.549 --> 01:31:26.892
You wanna talk about loyalty? Talk about
honour? Give me this dago right here.

01:31:26.992 --> 01:31:29.227
- Petey, get me a cup of coffee, will ya?
- Yeah.

01:31:29.327 --> 01:31:33.199
- Hey, fits in there nice.
- James R, you want the guy to continue?

01:31:33.299 --> 01:31:36.466
- Yeah, all right. Go ahead. Bobby?
- Oh.

01:31:36.566 --> 01:31:39.703
This is my dream. Thank you, Petey.

01:31:39.803 --> 01:31:42.208
Wanna know what my dream is? Huh?

01:31:42.308 --> 01:31:43.308
Fitz?

01:31:43.775 --> 01:31:46.144
it's a dream of community for working men...

01:31:46.244 --> 01:31:50.678
it's for broken-down truckers to drink beer,
fart, and lie about the waitresses they fucked.

01:31:50.778 --> 01:31:53.450
- That's right.
- A truck stop with a patio.

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:58.424
Wanna make retired truckers feel at home?
Put a condom machine in their living room.

01:31:58.524 --> 01:32:02.205
That's a good idea.
Hey, Jerry, get me a price on that.

01:32:03.213 --> 01:32:05.204
Don't strain yourself, Bobby.

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.469
Thank you. Give me that briefcase.
Put this in the safe, for fun.

01:32:14.569 --> 01:32:16.605
Subpoenas from the McClellan Committee.

01:32:16.705 --> 01:32:18.740
- Huh?
- Loan policy.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.648
- The loans are legit.
- All the Las Vegas loans. Record Test Fleet.

01:32:22.748 --> 01:32:25.083
- Test Fleet is legit.
- Kennedy and...

01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:28.751
it's a fuckin' vendetta.
These two little creeps are riding into office...

01:32:28.851 --> 01:32:31.088
- We have a subpoena.
- Forget about the subpoena.

01:32:31.188 --> 01:32:33.457
You can't square off with the White House.

01:32:33.557 --> 01:32:36.524
Then they don't square off with me.

01:32:36.624 --> 01:32:39.161
You follow me?
Don't tell me who I can square off with.

01:32:39.261 --> 01:32:42.134
Don't use words with me.
Any man fucks with me...

01:32:42.234 --> 01:32:44.868
- They have a subpoena.
- I say fuck the subpoena.

01:32:44.968 --> 01:32:49.274
Fuck you, too. Guy needed his brother elected
fuckin' president of the US to get a job.

01:32:49.374 --> 01:32:54.646
You'd have been a bond salesman. You're
the brother-in-law they make jokes about.

01:32:54.746 --> 01:32:58.246
I don't know what you're trying to prove,
but you're proving it.

01:32:58.346 --> 01:33:02.350
I'm proving what?
You got nothing on me. You got a TV show.

01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:05.554
The justice department
has plenty on you, Mr. Hoffa.

01:33:05.654 --> 01:33:08.291
You don't impress me
and your office don't impress me,

01:33:08.391 --> 01:33:11.662
and your family don't impress me.
Bunch of rum runners.

01:33:11.762 --> 01:33:15.133
And I don't need $300 million
and my brother elected president

01:33:15.233 --> 01:33:20.072
to whip your fuckin' ass, you slimy prick.
I beat that trumped-up charge down south.

01:33:20.172 --> 01:33:24.105
I'll beat you again. There is no
organized crime in the Teamsters...

01:33:24.205 --> 01:33:26.578
I am gonna see you in jail, Mr. Hoffa.

01:33:26.678 --> 01:33:29.379
- For what? What'd I fuckin' do?
- Your loans...

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:31.682
The pension fund has
the best record on loans.

01:33:31.782 --> 01:33:33.382
Bullshit.

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:36.085
- Best record in the country.
- Bullshit.

01:33:36.185 --> 01:33:38.754
For the working man.
You ever heard of work?

01:33:38.854 --> 01:33:41.356
I want this man in jail.
I'll see you behind bars.

01:33:41.456 --> 01:33:44.127
Who in the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

01:33:44.227 --> 01:33:47.633
Fuck you and fuck your threats
and fuck your brother.

01:33:47.733 --> 01:33:49.697
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

01:33:49.797 --> 01:33:52.536
What the fuck did you say?

01:33:52.636 --> 01:33:55.940
I don't succumb to pressure
and I don't succumb to threats.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.210
I've received both vilification
and threats in the form of innuendo

01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:02.979
from personnel of the international
Brotherhood of Teamsters.

01:34:03.079 --> 01:34:06.615
Nothing will stop me or this office
from the continuance of our duties.

01:34:06.715 --> 01:34:10.887
I swear to you that I will not stop
until those corrupted individuals

01:34:10.987 --> 01:34:13.426
have been put where they belong -
behind bars.

01:34:13.526 --> 01:34:16.929
Jimmy believes in you,
or you wouldn't be where you are.

01:34:17.029 --> 01:34:19.729
You didn't believe in him,
he wouldn't be where he is.

01:34:19.829 --> 01:34:22.268
Now's the time not to trust anybody.

01:34:22.368 --> 01:34:26.570
You didn't go to school with the guy, I don't
care what badge he's got stuck his lapel,

01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:30.542
you do not know him. Any questions,
come to Petey Connelly or me.

01:34:30.642 --> 01:34:34.028
Bobby, there's a man from
the Attorney General's office.

01:34:35.899 --> 01:34:36.899
Hey.

01:34:38.502 --> 01:34:43.355
- What are you doing?
- I'm Eliot Cookson. I have a subpoena...

01:34:43.455 --> 01:34:46.421
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I have a legitimate...

01:34:46.521 --> 01:34:49.625
You have a legitimate right
to get the fuck out before I bust you.

01:34:49.725 --> 01:34:53.194
- These people are witnesses...
- They didn't see a thing.

01:34:53.294 --> 01:34:55.274
Now, get going.

01:34:56.253 --> 01:35:00.701
- You don't understand me. Robert Kennedy...
- Fuck Robert Kennedy, and fuck you, too.

01:35:00.801 --> 01:35:04.191
What do I have to do,
throw you through a window? Are you deaf?

01:35:09.132 --> 01:35:13.796
I ate at a Chinese-German restaurant.
An hour later, I was hungry for power.

01:35:14.804 --> 01:35:17.487
- Hear that?
- Like those clubs? I'll send you a set.

01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:22.124
OK, OK, enough with the brushing, all right?
Back in your cage.

01:35:22.224 --> 01:35:24.529
Fuckin' guy thinks I'm a native dancer.

01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:28.832
- Jimmy, I wanna thank you for all your help.
- Good of you to come in.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:31.534
- Anything, anytime. You know that.
- We appreciate it.

01:35:31.634 --> 01:35:34.135
- I'll see you out there.
- Knock 'em dead, kid.

01:35:34.235 --> 01:35:37.751
With my act, I should be in your business.
At least I'd get mileage.

01:35:44.734 --> 01:35:45.734
What?

01:35:46.718 --> 01:35:50.400
- What is it?
- They've indicted Bobby and Peter, too.

01:35:52.609 --> 01:35:55.009
indicted Bobby and Pete...?

01:35:56.079 --> 01:35:58.126
I'm a busy man. What do they want from me?

01:35:58.226 --> 01:36:00.498
- They wanna try you.
- it's the same old shit.

01:36:00.598 --> 01:36:04.633
- They're just trying...
- They're succeeding's what they're doing.

01:36:04.733 --> 01:36:07.539
I'm a busy man.
I got a union to run. I got a job to do.

01:36:07.639 --> 01:36:10.908
We're not a small organization
with two people up in an office.

01:36:11.008 --> 01:36:13.075
Every time some jerk-off...
Excuse me, Jo.

01:36:13.175 --> 01:36:17.814
Every time some guy in Washington comes
up with an idea, I gotta haul records there.

01:36:17.914 --> 01:36:20.516
- Take it easy...
- Will you stop telling me that?

01:36:20.616 --> 01:36:23.685
Tell him to take it easy.
He's the one indicted. You take it easy.

01:36:23.785 --> 01:36:28.733
A guy drives up, big black Cadillac,
Teamster medallion on the side.

01:36:31.615 --> 01:36:33.981
- May I?
- Help yourself.

01:36:36.052 --> 01:36:39.736
You're too easy. You're too easy.
Teamster medallion on the side.

01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:42.223
A little fella gets out.

01:36:43.793 --> 01:36:48.045
Guy turns to St. Peter, he says, "I thought
you told me Jimmy Hoffa wasn't up here."

01:36:48.145 --> 01:36:51.396
St. Peter says, "That's God.
He just thinks he's Jimmy Hoffa."

01:36:55.038 --> 01:36:57.018
Are you laughing?

01:36:57.118 --> 01:37:01.792
- Bob, what are we gonna do?
- What do you mean?

01:37:01.892 --> 01:37:05.860
- I mean, what are we...
- The guys will come and tell us what to say.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.767
.. it even brought my family and I
closer together...

01:37:08.867 --> 01:37:13.036
The lawyers will come down and tell us.

01:37:13.136 --> 01:37:17.651
Buck up, Peter. Pete, we're the Teamsters.

01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:20.129
Yeah.

01:37:45.622 --> 01:37:47.622
Any man...

01:37:47.938 --> 01:37:52.311
Any man can have
an accusation thrown at him.

01:37:52.411 --> 01:37:54.746
Am I immune?

01:37:54.846 --> 01:37:56.446
Are you?

01:37:57.834 --> 01:38:02.817
in my opinion,
it is our very prominence itself

01:38:02.917 --> 01:38:07.355
that draws this, that draws these attacks.

01:38:07.455 --> 01:38:09.742
I will not be swayed.

01:38:10.747 --> 01:38:15.707
The international Brotherhood of Teamsters
will not be swayed.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.586
And our policy of unity will not be swayed.

01:38:24.694 --> 01:38:27.026
That's right.

01:38:29.366 --> 01:38:33.151
We must be ever watchful.

01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:38.787
We led the Teamsters, and the Teamsters led
the working man into the middle class.

01:38:38.887 --> 01:38:42.936
And, buddy, we intend to stay here.

01:38:46.483 --> 01:38:48.283
Hey, Bob.

01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:02.510
it's a boxing match.
You gotta get in there and mix it up.

01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:06.485
You wanna dish it out,
you gotta get in close enough

01:39:06.585 --> 01:39:09.766
that you, too,
have the possibility of getting hurt.

01:39:12.108 --> 01:39:14.560
That's life, my friends.

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:21.061
it's give and take and mix it up,
and that's what I am not afraid of.

01:39:21.161 --> 01:39:26.248
And that is what made the Teamsters
what we are today, and I'm proud of it.

01:39:32.462 --> 01:39:35.124
Proud to serve you.

01:39:52.916 --> 01:39:57.898
James R Hoffa, Robert Ciaro,
Peter Connelly, et al,

01:39:57.998 --> 01:40:02.287
for bribery, fraud,
conspiracy to commit same.

01:40:11.367 --> 01:40:16.817
Billy Flynn. Third-degree burns,
90% all over his body.

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:22.423
The motherfucker can't stop smoking.
His cigarette, the fumes, some fuckin' thing.

01:40:22.523 --> 01:40:24.810
Vaboom. There he goes.

01:40:25.682 --> 01:40:29.900
- Another one, Bobby?
- in a minute. I'm coming to the point of it.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.340
The priest, who was Father Doyle down at
St. Margaret's, which you wouldn't know,

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.791
asked him to confess.

01:40:38.795 --> 01:40:40.476
I'm coming to the end of it.

01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:46.229
As he is dying, Bill Flynn
looks the priest in the eye.

01:40:48.137 --> 01:40:50.128
"Fuck you."

01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:58.293
To respond, they have nothing.
Jimmy, everybody gonna walk.

01:40:58.393 --> 01:41:02.442
- To respond to your request - now pour it.
- Heh.

01:41:03.419 --> 01:41:07.935
Fuckin' man built the union
with a pair of balls and a Billy club.

01:41:08.035 --> 01:41:13.553
$200 million a year in dues.
Some bullshit fag in Washington...

01:41:15.532 --> 01:41:19.593
Fuck it. I said it. They got nothing.
Nothing but talk.

01:41:23.139 --> 01:41:26.024
- Going my way?
- Yeah.

01:41:26.124 --> 01:41:28.657
- What did they come up with in this trial?
- Nothing.

01:41:28.757 --> 01:41:31.697
Nothing. Not a fuckin' thing.

01:41:31.797 --> 01:41:34.199
- You watching the television?
- Yeah, I seen it.

01:41:34.299 --> 01:41:37.365
"Where were you on this day?"
Hey, somewhere, pal.

01:41:37.465 --> 01:41:40.501
"What were you doing?"
None of your fuckin' business.

01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:42.570
None of your motherfuckin' business.

01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:45.308
What if they had something?

01:41:45.408 --> 01:41:48.944
They ain't got nothing.
There's nothing to have.

01:41:49.044 --> 01:41:52.433
I heard the government
got to one of the guys.

01:41:53.436 --> 01:41:59.568
- Where'd you hear that?
- I heard a guy high up was giving Hoffa up.

01:42:01.544 --> 01:42:04.877
- Who are you?
- I heard the government had him.

01:42:04.977 --> 01:42:05.977
Had Jimmy?

01:42:06.077 --> 01:42:11.031
And if other defendants could
corroborate their case, they'd let them walk.

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:13.714
That's what I heard.

01:42:16.459 --> 01:42:21.611
You, for example. You could cross over
and testify for the government.

01:42:21.711 --> 01:42:25.725
They'd grant you immunity and let you walk.

01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:30.285
You ain't got nothing.

01:42:30.385 --> 01:42:34.776
- You got nothing or you wouldn't be here.
- We got him.

01:42:36.579 --> 01:42:39.031
And he's going away.

01:42:39.131 --> 01:42:42.516
Well, if he's going away, I'm going with him.

01:42:43.519 --> 01:42:46.750
You want me to give up Jimmy Hoffa?

01:42:48.825 --> 01:42:52.090
You want me to give up Jimmy Hoffa?

01:42:53.429 --> 01:42:55.920
You piece of shit.

01:43:00.103 --> 01:43:02.420
Witnesses for the prosecution.

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:06.839
Your Honour, the prosecution
would like to call

01:43:08.778 --> 01:43:11.269
just one more witness.

01:43:16.252 --> 01:43:20.869
And at this meeting,
I'm referring to the meeting of December 6,

01:43:20.969 --> 01:43:23.289
you saw what?

01:43:24.694 --> 01:43:27.959
- They discussed...
- "They" being?

01:43:31.134 --> 01:43:36.055
- Mr. Hoffa and Mr. D'Allesandro.
- Mr. Hoffa and Mr. D'Allesandro.

01:43:36.155 --> 01:43:39.472
Thank you. They discussed?

01:43:42.311 --> 01:43:45.144
Formation of the pension fund.

01:43:49.352 --> 01:43:50.552
And...

01:43:52.355 --> 01:43:54.273
And its use by organized crime?

01:43:54.373 --> 01:43:58.839
Objection. There are no links established
between my clients and Mr. D'Allesandro.

01:43:58.939 --> 01:44:04.080
- Overruled. You may continue.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:09.217
And so, on this hunting trip, on which...?

01:44:09.317 --> 01:44:11.917
On which they

01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:20.698
they laid out the scheme by which
the pension fund would give loans.

01:44:20.798 --> 01:44:25.265
- To Mr. D'Allesandro?
- Yes, sir.

01:44:25.365 --> 01:44:28.323
Thank you. That is all.

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:36.080
Mr. Connelly, did anyone except you
hear this alleged conversation

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:39.680
between the defendants
and Mr. D'Allesandro?

01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.796
in fact, there are no witnesses, are there?

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.922
No, sir.

01:44:46.022 --> 01:44:49.956
in other words,
there is no evidence whatsoever

01:44:50.056 --> 01:44:56.349
to support that this fantastical conversation
you describe ever took place. isn't that true?

01:45:00.456 --> 01:45:02.447
There's a...

01:45:06.028 --> 01:45:08.019
There's a hunting license.

01:45:19.509 --> 01:45:23.929
A hunting license issued to Peter Connelly.

01:45:24.029 --> 01:45:29.747
Scribbled on, the initials JRH,

01:45:30.653 --> 01:45:36.819
and the outlines of a plan for the diversion
of moneys from the pension fund.

01:45:37.827 --> 01:45:41.111
These notations, including the initials

01:45:41.211 --> 01:45:45.611
of James Riddle Hoffa,

01:45:47.069 --> 01:45:51.233
are in the handwriting of Carol D'Allesandro.

01:45:53.509 --> 01:45:56.171
Who the fuck keeps stuff that long?

01:46:15.498 --> 01:46:17.989
What are you doin'?

01:46:18.968 --> 01:46:21.459
You goin' with me?

01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:27.159
I was just putting a few things
I thought you'd need.

01:46:27.259 --> 01:46:30.576
You don't take anything to prison, Jo.

01:46:40.957 --> 01:46:43.619
it's not the end of the road.

01:46:45.194 --> 01:46:47.394
Eventually,

01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:51.227
everything's gonna finally be all right.

01:46:55.037 --> 01:46:59.201
- You got nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know that.

01:47:22.565 --> 01:47:26.884
Fitz is gonna be president until I return.

01:47:26.984 --> 01:47:32.188
I don't think there's anything else
to be said on that.

01:47:32.288 --> 01:47:33.288
No?

01:47:36.145 --> 01:47:37.145
Fine.

01:47:39.282 --> 01:47:41.273
Otherwise...

01:48:00.436 --> 01:48:02.036
Jimmy...

01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:03.420
Fitz.

01:48:04.186 --> 01:48:06.153
I tell you,

01:48:06.253 --> 01:48:11.407
you don't know what to do,
what good it do I tell you?

01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:14.566
Jimmy...

01:48:14.666 --> 01:48:16.266
Petey...

01:48:16.398 --> 01:48:19.535
You don't have to say anything, Fitz.

01:48:19.635 --> 01:48:21.283
You'll do fine.

01:48:38.741 --> 01:48:41.403
Wave bye to Grandpa.

01:48:58.294 --> 01:49:00.785
Let's do this thing.

01:49:05.935 --> 01:49:07.583
- Sir.
- Hold on.

01:49:07.683 --> 01:49:10.183
Let him through, let him through.

01:49:10.283 --> 01:49:14.072
All right. Don't worry about it.
I ain't in any rush.

01:49:16.178 --> 01:49:20.171
I know you got a job to do. So do I.

01:49:22.418 --> 01:49:24.409
I wanna say...

01:49:25.354 --> 01:49:29.256
that this is an unhappy day in my life.

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.641
All of my petitions that I have filed

01:49:34.741 --> 01:49:41.918
have stated that the government
has wiretapped, room-bugged, surveilled,

01:49:42.018 --> 01:49:46.053
and did everything unconstitutional
that they could do

01:49:46.153 --> 01:49:51.192
to try and place me in jail, which they
have temporarily succeeded in doing so.

01:49:51.292 --> 01:49:54.030
But I wanna say to my

01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:57.330
1,800,000-strong

01:49:58.501 --> 01:50:03.206
members of the international
Brotherhood of Teamsters,

01:50:03.306 --> 01:50:07.888
don't believe what people would
have you think with fancy words.

01:50:09.498 --> 01:50:13.249
I never benefited one dollar

01:50:13.349 --> 01:50:16.964
from the loans made by the pension fund.

01:50:18.974 --> 01:50:21.374
Legal loans.

01:50:22.745 --> 01:50:28.775
Loans that made profits for the union,
and what is wrong with that?

01:50:30.653 --> 01:50:34.316
- What is wrong with that?
- Not a thing, Jimmy.

01:50:35.324 --> 01:50:37.349
Tell that to Robert Kennedy.

01:50:47.369 --> 01:50:50.270
Come on, Jimmy. Give us a story.

01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:58.871
- How does it feel to be going to jail, Jimmy?
- Mind your own business.

01:51:38.454 --> 01:51:39.854
Pricks.

01:51:42.525 --> 01:51:45.376
I can't even scratch my nose.

01:51:45.476 --> 01:51:48.976
- Does it itch?
- No.

01:51:49.076 --> 01:51:52.556
What the fuck you complainin' about, then?

01:52:04.246 --> 01:52:06.828
What time is it?

01:52:06.928 --> 01:52:09.612
- Six.
- Check it out.

01:52:18.794 --> 01:52:20.887
This is it.

01:53:50.286 --> 01:53:51.286
Bob.

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:55.150
Jimmy's got a lot of friends.

01:54:53.148 --> 01:54:55.398
- Hiya, Jimmy.
- Hi, Jimmy.

01:54:55.498 --> 01:54:57.475
Hey, Tony.

01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:16.661
- Yeah, he's on.
- That's par.

01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:20.990
Bobby. I thought...

01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:24.996
- Weren't we gonna go meet him?
- There's no point in that now. I'm out.

01:55:25.096 --> 01:55:29.264
We were gonna go out and meet you.
How are you?

01:55:29.364 --> 01:55:33.333
I looked for you over at the office.
They told me you were here.

01:55:33.433 --> 01:55:37.381
- How's Jimmy?
- Fitz, you'd know if you went to see him.

01:55:38.527 --> 01:55:40.844
- How is he?
- You gotta get him out.

01:55:40.944 --> 01:55:43.713
He's not well.
You gotta get him outta there.

01:55:43.813 --> 01:55:47.550
- We're working on it.
- How serious is that? I'm not kidding you.

01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:52.118
We're working on it. I have a plan.
I'm sorry I can't share it with you now.

01:55:52.218 --> 01:55:54.187
You gotta get him out.

01:55:54.287 --> 01:55:58.061
- We're gonna get him out.
- He can't do eight more years, I'm tellin' you.

01:55:58.161 --> 01:56:03.346
- You're just gonna have to trust me on this.
- You got to get him out.

01:56:17.966 --> 01:56:21.697
The idea is this -
the Teamsters endorse Nixon.

01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:44.942
- And they go to Nixon.
- They what?

01:56:45.042 --> 01:56:47.518
They give you a pardon.

01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.727
- They give me a pardon.
- Yes.

01:56:54.336 --> 01:56:58.053
We give them the endorsement
and the money, they give me a pardon.

01:56:58.153 --> 01:57:02.474
- Yes.
- I voted for the guy three times.

01:57:03.745 --> 01:57:05.345
Jimmy...

01:57:05.661 --> 01:57:08.309
You've been gone five years.

01:57:09.384 --> 01:57:11.875
it feels like a thousand.

01:57:16.358 --> 01:57:17.358
When?

01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:26.328
What's his name? I can't hear ya.

01:57:37.613 --> 01:57:39.945
in a minute.

01:57:41.483 --> 01:57:43.849
in a minute. Vamp with it.

01:57:54.263 --> 01:57:56.863
Jesus Christ.

01:57:57.045 --> 01:57:59.023
I'm tired.

01:58:00.536 --> 01:58:04.131
Well, now, time to just rest up, huh, Jim?

01:58:05.307 --> 01:58:09.126
I wanna thank you, Fitz. You done a good job.

01:58:09.226 --> 01:58:12.044
You done a good job. You kept it together.

01:58:12.481 --> 01:58:15.529
You done what you were supposed to do.

01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:18.199
What happened...

01:58:18.299 --> 01:58:21.436
We rode it out, and here we are.

01:58:21.536 --> 01:58:26.877
Now, tomorrow, tomorrow we go in,
first thing, end of the week,

01:58:26.977 --> 01:58:30.612
we announce I'm gonna make a speech,
as back in office.

01:58:30.712 --> 01:58:35.261
Get the TV if you can.
Bobby, give him the list.

01:58:37.039 --> 01:58:41.358
These guys are out. I don't like
the way they were behaving when I was in.

01:58:41.458 --> 01:58:46.128
I got no complaints you, Fitz.
But these guys, they're gone.

01:58:46.228 --> 01:58:47.828
Jimmy...

01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:50.898
I gotta get back in the swing. indulge me.

01:58:50.998 --> 01:58:53.546
- Jimmy.
- Tomorrow...

01:58:54.623 --> 01:58:56.181
Jimmy what?

01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:07.500
You know what they used to say - tell me
now, I'm gonna find out about it anyway.

01:59:09.004 --> 01:59:10.004
Yeah.

01:59:13.308 --> 01:59:16.728
Jo, go out and tell them I'll be right there,
would you, honey? Please?

01:59:16.828 --> 01:59:19.212
- OK, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

01:59:35.831 --> 01:59:37.613
You what?

01:59:37.713 --> 01:59:41.051
- You fuckin' lied. You fuckin' lied.
- Now, Jimmy. Jimmy.

01:59:41.151 --> 01:59:45.787
- I did the best I could.
- You big piece of shit. You what? You fuck.

01:59:45.887 --> 01:59:47.487
Frankie.

01:59:48.710 --> 01:59:50.310
Frankie.

01:59:53.382 --> 01:59:58.432
What do I want you to do?
I want you to kill the cocksucker.

01:59:58.532 --> 02:00:02.941
I want you to stuff his arms up his ass,
that's what I fuckin' want.

02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:06.309
He made the deal
with that prick Colson to get me out of prison.

02:00:06.409 --> 02:00:09.679
He made a deal
I gotta resign from the Teamsters.

02:00:09.779 --> 02:00:13.166
That's the deal - I gotta resign.
I'm out. I'm out.

02:00:14.102 --> 02:00:17.685
Next ten fuckin' years I'm out
the American labour movement.

02:00:17.785 --> 02:00:22.458
Six months I'm eligible for parole. I never
would've done this if I knew what this is.

02:00:22.558 --> 02:00:24.827
They wait until now to tell me.

02:00:24.927 --> 02:00:27.027
I never would've agreed.

02:00:27.127 --> 02:00:28.931
Fitz. Fitzsimmons.

02:00:29.031 --> 02:00:34.580
All the time he's telling people he's
scheming to get me out, he done nothing.

02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:39.409
What am I supposed to do?
I want him fuckin' dead. That's what I want.

02:00:39.509 --> 02:00:43.487
I want his fuckin' back broke
is what I fuckin' want.

02:00:48.670 --> 02:00:51.150
What do the lawyers say, Jimmy?

02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:55.958
Fuck the lawyers. Fuck the law.
I don't want law, I want justice.

02:00:56.058 --> 02:01:01.933
I took that prick off a loading dock
40 years ago, and now he's betraying me.

02:01:02.033 --> 02:01:06.920
- Are you telling me you don't understand?
- Yeah, I understand it.

02:01:10.092 --> 02:01:13.323
And I can't get close to it.

02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:20.324
You can't get close to it?
What does that mean?

02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:26.187
Does it mean no, D'Alli?
is that what it means?

02:01:26.287 --> 02:01:30.026
If you think I'll fuckin' stand still for this,
you're out of your mind,

02:01:30.126 --> 02:01:35.033
cos if he don't reverse it, you don't reverse it,
I'll do what I gotta do to get the union back.

02:01:35.133 --> 02:01:38.935
- What does that mean?
- I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

02:01:39.035 --> 02:01:41.736
What does it mean?

02:01:41.836 --> 02:01:44.223
What does it mean?

02:01:46.661 --> 02:01:51.745
We talking words here, D'Alli?
We using words?

02:01:51.845 --> 02:01:54.415
That what we're doing?

02:01:54.515 --> 02:01:58.496
40 fuckin' years.
We're gonna use words?

02:01:59.741 --> 02:02:02.175
Too fuckin' late.

02:02:04.546 --> 02:02:06.346
Too late.

02:02:11.753 --> 02:02:14.604
That concludes this press conference.

02:02:14.704 --> 02:02:19.092
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
No, no more questions.

02:02:36.711 --> 02:02:38.372
Hey, Frank.

02:02:40.482 --> 02:02:41.482
John.

02:02:44.352 --> 02:02:49.504
I didn't wanna say it at the news conference,
we've been friends a long time, but...

02:02:49.604 --> 02:02:54.540
Jimmy's saying you and Colson conspired
to keep him out of the union for ten years.

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.680
Nothing could be further from the truth. When
he talks like that, he's lying through his teeth.

02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:04.432
And by the way, I got news for Jimmy Hoffa.
I ain't that easy to get rid of.

02:03:29.264 --> 02:03:32.312
What is it Jimmy wants?

02:03:32.412 --> 02:03:36.393
- He wants to talk with you.
- He's too hot.

02:03:40.642 --> 02:03:43.634
This whole thing is too hot.

02:03:45.347 --> 02:03:47.860
You gotta tell him the shit he's doing.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.960
You.

02:03:53.321 --> 02:03:55.721
You gotta stop it.

02:03:58.493 --> 02:04:01.575
Need to cool down.

02:04:01.675 --> 02:04:04.461
When it dies down, we'll talk.

02:04:05.567 --> 02:04:09.560
- He needs to talk with you.
- Or what?

02:04:10.906 --> 02:04:14.055
is there an "or what" with that?

02:04:14.155 --> 02:04:20.445
Or, he says, you and him can't get together,
reverse this thing, he's gonna go to the press.

02:04:39.401 --> 02:04:42.859
All right, tell him it's not necessary.

02:04:46.942 --> 02:04:49.934
Tell him I know he doesn't mean it.

02:04:53.748 --> 02:04:56.945
Tell him I'll meet him. Where?

02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:01.147
The roadhouse. Two tomorrow.

02:05:04.225 --> 02:05:07.217
Tell him it's gonna be all right.

02:05:20.608 --> 02:05:25.895
You tell him ten more minutes,
then we're gone. We're gone.

02:05:25.995 --> 02:05:28.866
You tell him we waited four hours.

02:05:28.966 --> 02:05:32.408
We're gone. He'll know what that means.

02:06:04.452 --> 02:06:08.946
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Still waitin' on that part.

02:06:10.892 --> 02:06:13.884
Are you a Teamster?

02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:18.925
Get the fuck out of here.

02:06:20.201 --> 02:06:24.695
Let's see if we can't roust
some fuckin' brotherhood the thing.

02:06:26.007 --> 02:06:29.067
Here. Call that number.

02:06:30.512 --> 02:06:34.398
Just call that fuckin' number.
You tell 'em Bobby said...

02:06:34.498 --> 02:06:36.900
Do it quick. I wanna keep this phone open.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.218
You tell them Bobby said to
get out here with what you need right now.

02:06:43.792 --> 02:06:47.785
Give me two more coffees to go,
a pack of smokes.

02:06:51.299 --> 02:06:54.881
Hello. Yeah, Bobby Ciaro
told me to call this number.

02:06:54.981 --> 02:06:59.906
I'm out here at the roadhouse.
I'm having a problem with my truck.

02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:17.858
I don't fuckin' believe it.

02:07:19.027 --> 02:07:21.518
Said they're coming right over with it.

02:07:22.564 --> 02:07:24.964
You're fuckin' right he is.

02:07:26.668 --> 02:07:30.934
- You remember that.
- How can I thank you?

02:07:32.974 --> 02:07:35.238
You don't gotta thank me.

02:07:36.244 --> 02:07:39.611
Nice. Guess you got a lot of pull, huh?

02:07:43.618 --> 02:07:46.537
A lot of pull, yeah.

02:07:46.637 --> 02:07:49.101
I got a lot of pull.

02:07:49.201 --> 02:07:51.852
I'm the last fuckin' Mohican.

02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:58.545
That's the way it should be.

02:07:58.645 --> 02:08:01.727
- Are we all in it?
- Fuck, yeah.

02:08:05.907 --> 02:08:08.307
- Thanks.
- it's all right.

02:08:11.346 --> 02:08:14.179
This was stuck to the bottom of it.

02:08:15.984 --> 02:08:18.976
That really from Jimmy Hoffa?

02:08:22.757 --> 02:08:25.225
That's really from Jimmy Hoffa?

02:08:26.761 --> 02:08:28.524
That's right, son.

02:08:29.497 --> 02:08:32.830
You know him? You know Jimmy Hoffa?

02:08:33.801 --> 02:08:35.792
There you go.

02:08:39.307 --> 02:08:43.193
I'm gonna show you something, kid.
Come on.

02:08:43.293 --> 02:08:45.494
You wanna thank somebody?

02:08:45.594 --> 02:08:49.914
You wanna thank somebody, thank
somebody who deserves your thanks.

02:08:56.558 --> 02:09:02.311
I want you to take these,
go over there, and thank that man.

02:09:02.411 --> 02:09:07.699
Just do it. If you wanna thank someone,
you go thank him.

02:09:11.973 --> 02:09:13.173
Go on.

02:09:34.829 --> 02:09:37.392
- Mr. Hoffa?
- Yeah, that's right.
