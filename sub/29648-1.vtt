[music playing]

00:28.462 --> 00:31.030
[buzzing]

00:38.739 --> 00:40.039
Nature calls.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.048
Don't go anywhere.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.584
Well, that was
kind of fucked up.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.472
[sizzling]

01:20.281 --> 01:22.781
Nature doesn't only call men.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.516
Shots of her pussy, right?

01:27.521 --> 01:30.489
You're not a pussy, are you?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.991
OK, OK.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.492
Hold up.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.993
I'm seeing two of you
right now, and I just

01:34.994 --> 01:36.494
hope to God I nail
the right one.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.613
[growling]

01:37.614 --> 01:38.730
Close your eyes
for the surprise.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.598
OK, yeah.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.808
My girlfriend is
going to be jealous.

01:53.814 --> 01:54.746
Of you or me?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.286
You ready to die for me, lover?

02:01.288 --> 02:02.721
[music playing]

02:02.723 --> 02:05.591
I think you are.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.359
Yeah.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.128
I knew you'd like this.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.363
You like Mardi Gras beads, huh?

02:11.365 --> 02:16.135
You like making girls
show you their tits, huh?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.470
Well, I hate these beads.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.143
[crackling]

02:32.553 --> 02:35.521
Another college kids
ODs on Mardi Gras.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.862
Typical guy.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.897
Just when things heat up,
he's dead to the world.

02:44.899 --> 02:48.333
[music playing]

02:48.335 --> 02:51.403
Did you really dose him?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.789
He'll be fine.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.174
He'll sleep it off and
hate himself tomorrow.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.342
It was our first Mardi Gras.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.745
We wanted to--

02:59.747 --> 03:03.182
You wanted to what?

03:03.184 --> 03:04.950
Explore.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.952
Yeah.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.953
Well, that probably shouldn't
happen in a shitty motel,

03:08.956 --> 03:11.757
should it?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.042
[music playing]

03:13.043 --> 03:14.326
(SINGING) Run if you dare.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.261
You wont' get away.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.565
I got you in my sights.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.203
Fight if you want to.

03:24.205 --> 03:28.807
You can't resist my
calculating mind.

03:31.612 --> 03:38.483
And you know what it
takes to free your soul.

03:41.255 --> 03:47.893
Distracted by [inaudible]
sacrificing you.

03:47.895 --> 03:58.237
You know, you know, will
you go through the deepest

03:58.239 --> 04:00.872
hell in you?

04:00.874 --> 04:09.815
Will you wallow in the
deepest darkest you?

04:09.817 --> 04:18.790
Will you [inaudible] to
the deepest hell in you?

04:18.792 --> 04:28.667
Will you go through the
deepest hell in you?

05:15.382 --> 05:18.684
(SINGING) Salt air on
the windows of life.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.688
Lay your evening as
the sun starts to rise.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.657
Blue skies on the [inaudible].

05:25.659 --> 05:28.860
Little to remember,
but I like to forget.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.371
[cheering]

05:40.808 --> 05:42.341
Hey, ladies.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.711
I got what you need.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.530
[scoffs]

05:47.531 --> 05:49.348
I'm sure you think you do.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.117
[music playing]

05:52.119 --> 05:53.352
[whoosh]

05:57.024 --> 05:59.024
Very nice.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.092
You keep it.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.393
Do you need it?

06:01.395 --> 06:04.429
Do you seek?

06:04.431 --> 06:05.364
Take a picture, dude.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.933
It'll last longer.

06:07.935 --> 06:11.937
How do you know I
will seek something?

06:11.938 --> 06:15.940
I see things right out in front
of me, in front of my cock.

06:15.943 --> 06:16.908
You dig?

06:16.910 --> 06:17.976
Right.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.411
You can see the future.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.080
Of course.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.717
$25 please.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.569
What?

06:27.570 --> 06:29.420
Then you must be able
to see that I don't

06:29.423 --> 06:31.456
have $25 for a chicken foot.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.425
A rabbit foot, maybe.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.427
How about this?

06:35.429 --> 06:40.932
Got $0.25.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.933
Are we good?

06:46.707 --> 06:49.074
Can I get that back?

06:49.076 --> 06:52.077
[music playing]

06:53.547 --> 07:00.585
(SINGING) [inaudible] because I
love for my [inaudible] sleeve.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.255
Don't leave.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.924
I'll paint it bad
for [inaudible]

07:05.926 --> 07:07.426
[laughter]

07:07.428 --> 07:09.861
You have [inaudible].

07:09.863 --> 07:12.898
[cheering]

07:14.668 --> 07:17.636
Hope, show them your boobs.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.704
OK, OK, OK.

07:19.706 --> 07:23.208
To Hope, who starts her new
job at Hooters on Tuesday.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.327
Very funny, Benay.

07:25.328 --> 07:27.445
It's a coffeehouse, and I'm
a barista, not a bar maid.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.747
Tragic underuse of assets.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.682
Best job on campus,
and you know it.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.716
Took me a year to get it.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.884
Here, here ladies.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.002
OK.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.119
1, 2, 3.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.126
Ah, Benay!

07:41.128 --> 07:42.594
[inaudible] tequila.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.196
Always.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.964
OK.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.731
My nomination who gets
to buy our next round

07:47.734 --> 07:52.838
goes to those that want to
be macho men over there.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.173
I think the blue shirt
has a superpower.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.543
It's sucking golf balls
through a garden hose.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.711
[laughter]

07:59.713 --> 08:02.047
Ladies, ladies, listen.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.266
Listen.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.484
We're in a weird place, so
remember the 60-second rule.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.521
If anyone is out of sight
for more than a minute, even

08:09.523 --> 08:12.190
in the bathroom, we go get her.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.103
The bathroom?

08:14.104 --> 08:16.015
But that's Hope's
favorite place to do it.

08:16.016 --> 08:17.927
That was only once, and
I was certainly wasted.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.031
Once?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.083
OK, twice.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.134
But the second time doesn't
count, because that lifeguard

08:24.137 --> 08:25.637
was too drunk to get it up.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.639
Look, I'm dead serious.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.640
Girls going missing at
Mardi Gras all the time.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.142
We need to watch
out for one another.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.561
That's all I'm saying.

08:32.562 --> 08:33.979
We need to get
this chick an easy.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.814
Yeah.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.648
That will happen about two--

08:37.651 --> 08:38.950
oh yeah, never.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.220
[laughter]

08:45.626 --> 08:47.081
Game on, ladies.

08:47.082 --> 08:48.537
Get ready for our
next free round.

08:48.538 --> 08:49.993
Oh, he looks like a
total douche to me.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.963
They all look like
total douches to you.

08:51.965 --> 08:55.066
Tina, I'll give you the rebound
if there is one, but don't

08:55.068 --> 08:56.234
hold your breath.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.812
Well, are you going to buy me
a drink or just stare at me?

09:07.814 --> 09:12.217
Well, I was hoping I could do
both, if that's OK with you.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.184
Whiskey.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.319
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.588
That's for amateurs.

09:16.590 --> 09:20.091
Sazerac, two.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.949
I don't get it.

09:21.950 --> 09:23.806
She always gets the hot ones.

09:23.807 --> 09:25.663
It's an ancient
college secret, Katie.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.698
Hope's a slut.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.868
[music playing]

09:29.870 --> 09:32.237
So what kind of
name is Gar, anyway?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.006
Well it's sure for Gargol.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.774
See, my family's
originally from Normandy,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.709
but we've been here
in royal New Orleans

09:37.711 --> 09:40.111
for a very long, long time.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.748
New Orleans doesn't look very
royal to me, at least not

09:43.750 --> 09:45.684
what I've seen of it.

09:45.686 --> 09:49.120
Well, you just haven't
seen the right parts.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.190
Well, maybe you should
show me the right parts.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.024
[giggling]

09:53.026 --> 09:55.927
Excuse me.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.829
Hey, back at the hotel, I have
a three-story five-alarm beer

09:58.832 --> 10:01.299
bong that's trashed, like,
a half dozen chicks, like,

10:01.301 --> 10:02.601
completely laid waste.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.080
You interested?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.558
That sounds tempting.

10:05.559 --> 10:07.036
Look, I'm not, like,
steaming on you or anything.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.607
What's steaming?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.342
Never mind.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.076
Just, where are you girls from?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.379
We were talking before
you came and sat here.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.115
I know, but I made a bet
with my buddy over there,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.085
the monster tard with
the football jersey

10:20.087 --> 10:22.187
that I could get your number.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.154
You want my number?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.022
Yeah.

10:24.024 --> 10:24.889
OK.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.658
My number's 7--

10:26.660 --> 10:28.660
Yeah.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.462
Yeah.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.263
He seems dumb enough
to believe that.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.316
Yeah, funny.

10:34.317 --> 10:36.368
That's actually my number
for intermural basketball.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.837
I think this is meant to be.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.006
Look, it seems like
the polite let-down

10:41.008 --> 10:42.774
isn't getting to your head.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.210
Fuck off, OK?

10:45.212 --> 10:47.879
You should be fucking honored
that I would give a rat's

10:47.881 --> 10:49.180
ass about hitting your shit.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.132
Hold that thought.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.083
I'll be right back.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.220
What a fucking--

10:55.222 --> 10:58.323
Oh, oh!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.724
Ah, yeah.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.192
My apologies for that asshole.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.017
Wow.

11:03.018 --> 11:04.841
What exactly did you tell
him to make him go away?

11:04.842 --> 11:06.665
I told him we Cajuns are
inbred, and I was going

11:06.667 --> 11:08.266
to make him squeal like a pig.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.200
[laughter]

11:09.202 --> 11:11.069
Easy, [inaudible].

11:11.070 --> 11:12.937
There really are gentleman
here in the French Quarter.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.806
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going to go back

11:14.808 --> 11:16.441
to seducing your friend.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.342
With our blessing.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.714
Sorry about that.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.215
[clears throat]

11:24.217 --> 11:27.786
SO where were we?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.954
Maybe you can get
rid of that guy.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.823
That pervert's been
staring at me all night.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.727
What do you say we get out
of here, go for a ride?

11:35.729 --> 11:36.545
Yeah.

11:36.546 --> 11:37.362
I'll show you the town.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.315
[music playing]

11:40.316 --> 11:43.267
(SINGING) Don't [inaudible]
you want to keep on dancing.

11:43.270 --> 11:50.408
Don't [inaudible] you
want to get the show.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.943
Come dance with me.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.113
You want to keep on dancing.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.382
She would.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.251
She asked [inaudible] huh?

12:00.253 --> 12:03.154
(SINGING) Ready for
the hit and run.

12:03.156 --> 12:07.092
She's got roaming shoes,
ready for the muse

12:07.094 --> 12:09.761
because girls just
want to have fun.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.733
Well, I should've gotten
your door, shouldn't I?

12:14.735 --> 12:15.300
I'm sorry.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.170
[grunts]

12:23.276 --> 12:25.727
It's a loaner.

12:25.728 --> 12:28.179
I love you so much.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.749
[cheering]

12:32.018 --> 12:33.485
How old did you say you were?

12:33.487 --> 12:34.886
I just turned 23.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.421
[giggling]

12:36.423 --> 12:37.922
Oh, pretty flask.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.124
Don't mind if I do.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.961
[coughing]

12:42.963 --> 12:44.963
That's some real shit.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.799
It's [inaudible].

12:47.801 --> 12:49.300
But it's empty.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.070
Can we get more?

12:52.071 --> 12:54.839
Oh, it's an old family recipe,
but I got some more at home.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.508
Oh, well let's go
home then, son.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.244
[giggling]

13:00.514 --> 13:02.781
[engine revving]

13:04.184 --> 13:06.551
[laughter]

13:09.022 --> 13:11.022
Where the hell is Hope?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.290
I checked the bathrooms.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.392
She's not there.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.393
Oh my god.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.195
I'm going to call her.

13:17.197 --> 13:17.996
OK.

13:17.997 --> 13:18.796
We'll see you at home.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.538
[music playing]

13:31.478 --> 13:32.443
[inaudible]

13:32.445 --> 13:33.645
Yes.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.846
Why isn't she answering?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.548
Guys, this is serious.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.849
It's not that serious.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.018
Don't say another word.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.453
Get the fuck--

13:42.455 --> 13:43.972
Wait.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.490
What the fuck is this, huh?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.742
Get out of here.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.993
You come back here again,
I'm going to arrest you.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.230
Wait, where are you going.

13:52.232 --> 13:52.831
Yum.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.235
Are you a real cop?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.303
Yeah.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.370
I mean, undercover.

13:59.371 --> 14:00.437
I thought you were a ZZ Top fan.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.406
[laughter]

14:01.408 --> 14:02.607
No, no, no, no.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.310
Pantera.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.012
Sir, we actually have a
dumb question to ask you.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.448
In the big easy, there are
no dumb questions, just

14:10.450 --> 14:11.700
a lot of dumb people.

14:11.701 --> 14:12.951
Do you handle bar situations?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.519
Depends on who's buying.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.155
Well, we just left a bar
where we were with a friend,

14:17.157 --> 14:20.091
and she got really
drunk and disappeared.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.260
And now, she's not
answering her phone.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.612
Wow.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.963
You know, boy,
that's the first time

14:24.965 --> 14:26.531
I heard that during Mardi Gras.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.034
And let me guess, she left
with a really cute guy,

14:30.036 --> 14:33.004
and you guys are
going home alone?

14:33.006 --> 14:35.685
Alone?

14:35.686 --> 14:38.365
That's a sexist concept.

14:38.366 --> 14:41.045
Well, I am a New Orleans cop,
so just how evolved can I be?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.797
Pretty evolved.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.548
What I'm saying is even
if she wasn't that type--

14:44.551 --> 14:46.150
Wait, you just said wasn't.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.019
You mean isn't.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.887
Girls, it's Mardi
Gras, you know?

14:49.890 --> 14:53.992
Why don't you just have some
fun, give her a couple of days?

14:53.994 --> 14:56.027
No, but she knows that
we're leaving tomorrow.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.263
If you don't find your
friend by tomorrow,

14:58.265 --> 15:00.231
why don't you look me up?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.901
I don't know about that.

15:02.903 --> 15:03.902
Beard is real.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.069
We should look him up.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.037
He's a profession.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.238
That's right.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.438
He doesn't look
like a professional.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.874
All right.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.308
Let me ask you,
where was the bar

15:11.311 --> 15:14.112
you guys were
drinking in tonight?

15:14.114 --> 15:17.199
Where was it?

15:17.200 --> 15:20.285
It was on the corner
of Dophine and Lessops.

15:20.287 --> 15:25.323
Why don't I meet you there
tomorrow night at 8:00 o'clock?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.910
OK, OK.

15:28.911 --> 15:32.496
And as they say,
[speaking creole] or something

15:32.499 --> 15:33.848
like that.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.198
[laughter]

15:56.957 --> 15:59.958
I don't know whether to be
concerned or jealous as shit.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.127
How many times has Hope
ditched us for some guy, Benay?

16:03.129 --> 16:06.631
As many times as
she's blown some guy.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.967
Besides, she just texted us.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.169
Phone's about to die.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.370
Well, her charger is right here,
so that's not very reassuring.

16:13.373 --> 16:17.141
Guys, I have a serious question.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.210
Are there any beers
led in the honor bar,

16:19.212 --> 16:20.712
or did we drink them all?

16:20.714 --> 16:22.613
Why do they call
it an honor bar?

16:22.615 --> 16:28.386
Because it's an honor to
drink at 4:00 in the morning.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.689
I get drunker when I drink.

16:31.691 --> 16:35.159
I swear I lose IQ points
every time I hang out

16:35.161 --> 16:36.594
with you idiots.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.029
Can you open this?

16:42.168 --> 16:45.136
Thanks, mom.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.272
[giggling]

16:51.745 --> 16:53.478
Right here, little darling.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.680
[music playing]

16:55.682 --> 16:57.382
Let me get that for you.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.225
Meet Hope.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.427
That's really her name.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.797
So we welcome a new guest
to our family table.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.765
So you're the family?

17:17.037 --> 17:20.671
Say, Gar, you promised more
of that family recipe stuff?

17:20.673 --> 17:21.739
[laughter]

17:21.741 --> 17:22.573
Dolly for Dolly.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.508
Dolly for Dolly.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.442
Dolly for Dolly.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.376
Dolly for Dolly.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.388
You like to drink, do you?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.456
Who doesn't like to
drink here and there?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.059
I don't.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.193
Why not?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.395
Alcohol dulls the senses.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.733
She's a girl of slightly
elevated acumen,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.402
I should think.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.070
You sure don't any
more, do you, dear?

18:08.655 --> 18:11.656
This is your party, too.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.690
Back off.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.295
Here.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.696
Drink up.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.530
Right.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.565
[laughter]

18:22.802 --> 18:23.534
Woo.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.681
Well, here we go again.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.684
It's the show-off.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.252
Whatever turns you on.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.386
Bring it up.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.375
Oh.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.258
Sorry.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.661
Sorry.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.064
Good.

18:53.065 --> 18:55.466
Who in the hell wants
to be good here?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.534
Not me.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.601
[laughter]

18:58.671 --> 19:04.442
I want you to really
feel this, Bri.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.812
This is my gift to you
after all this time.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.690
[music playing]

19:19.692 --> 19:21.726
[laughter]

19:24.430 --> 19:25.313
Dolly for Dolly.

19:25.314 --> 19:26.197
Dolly for Dolly.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.331
Dolly for Dolly.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.699
Dolly for Dolly.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.668
Dolly for Dolly.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.402
Ah.

19:34.941 --> 19:35.907
Sorry, mom.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.843
[baby crying]

19:38.845 --> 19:40.578
[sighs]

19:46.286 --> 19:47.652
Time to feed the baby.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.696
[music playing]

20:04.504 --> 20:07.605
Decaf for me and two
black jacks for you two

20:07.607 --> 20:09.607
pale imitations of who
you were last night.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.343
Oh, I always thought
a decaf was kind of

20:12.345 --> 20:13.978
like a virgin Margarita.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.846
It's meant to trick your body.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.381
I like the taste of coffee.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.817
I don't need it
for a sweep-me-up.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.986
What's up with you and
all the old guys, anyway?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.371
I just like to flirt.

20:23.372 --> 20:24.755
Thomas is kind of cute, Benay.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.040
Oh.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.324
And funny, and not.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.611
[laughter]

20:29.612 --> 20:31.896
Cute or not cute, he is a cop,
and he is the only resource

20:31.898 --> 20:35.766
that we have at this point, so
you need to make him like you.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.003
That's one thing Tina is
good at, men liking her.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.672
Well, don't be jealous.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.441
I'll do my best to
keep him hooked.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.909
You want to try
to call her again?

20:48.381 --> 20:50.281
[phone ringing]

20:50.283 --> 20:53.684
Straight to voicemail.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.020
[music playing]

20:56.022 --> 20:58.756
[birds chirping]

21:17.010 --> 21:19.277
[giggling]

21:28.521 --> 21:30.721
[baby muttering]

21:38.531 --> 21:43.834
Oh, our host is awake finally.

21:43.836 --> 21:44.969
God damn it, mom.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.573
I'm not your mom.

21:51.978 --> 21:56.647
She kept struggling,
waking up and whatnot.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.650
You know they have to
be comfortable to last.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.320
Well then, tell her
not to fight with me.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.856
She is not fighting you.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.991
She's scared.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.063
Are you sobered up yet, honey?

22:14.834 --> 22:17.118
Good.

22:17.119 --> 22:19.403
I'll come by with some
food a little later.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.605
You could eat a
horse, couldn't you?

22:35.555 --> 22:37.755
Don't you be making me
look bad with Justice.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.424
I may be in this damn chair,
but I got all kinds of ways

22:40.426 --> 22:43.027
to make you obey my will.

22:43.029 --> 22:52.803
Lucky little thing, living
life mobile, walking places,

22:52.805 --> 22:56.707
attracting the young bucks
by swinging your derriere.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.776
That damn curse had
happened one week earlier,

22:58.778 --> 23:00.544
I'd be sashaying
around just like you,

23:00.546 --> 23:02.713
wagging my little derriere,
instead of sitting

23:02.715 --> 23:08.419
in this damn chair for eternity
with an ass flat as a pancake.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.054
One week earlier.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.127
That's when Justice
punched me in the face

23:16.129 --> 23:17.661
and threw me down the stairs.

23:20.666 --> 23:23.534
He still loves me, though.

23:23.536 --> 23:27.037
My family moved to
America in the 1830s.

23:27.039 --> 23:31.776
My youngest daughter Blanche,
she was the star then.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.811
She graduated from the Sorbonne.

23:33.813 --> 23:40.651
That's in Paris with honors,
and was absolutely stunning.

23:40.653 --> 23:45.089
So when do I get to show
you off to my parents?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.091
I need you to meet mine first.

23:47.093 --> 23:52.029
My family is very particular
about who I spend my time with,

23:52.031 --> 23:54.365
but you understand.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.700
Well, hopefully
they'll approve me.

23:56.702 --> 23:59.603
I don't know.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.773
How large is your ranch?

24:02.775 --> 24:08.045
Oh, it's about 60 acres, plenty
of room for us and our rugrats.

24:10.817 --> 24:14.118
You really expect me to spoil
this figure with children?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.591
But my parents--

24:20.593 --> 24:24.028
I'll have this figure forever.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.864
We put Blanche on the hunt
to find the perfect family

24:26.866 --> 24:35.005
to marry into, but she made
a mistake, a tragic mistake.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.775
My whore of a daughter
had an affair that

24:37.777 --> 24:41.078
cost our family everything.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.615
I told you, I'm not
holding out, as you put it.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.618
I'm just not that kind of girl.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.119
You're so beautiful.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.677
What could that be?

24:56.678 --> 24:58.728
Just a little token
of my love for you.

24:58.731 --> 25:03.200
But before we do this, I
have one question for you.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.635
What's that?

25:04.636 --> 25:06.069
About your visitor
the other day.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.638
Visitor?

25:07.639 --> 25:09.205
A colored fellow.

25:09.208 --> 25:13.177
Oh, that was your visitor,
actually, I think.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.879
A delivery boy.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.213
Right.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.648
What about him?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.082
Is there anything you
want to tell me about it?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.284
Nothing to tell.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.752
That's not what I hear.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.858
A slave told me he
saw you guys together,

25:27.860 --> 25:30.794
heard you moaning and such.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.796
Well, your slave heard wrong.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.533
Even slaves know that sound.

25:35.535 --> 25:39.169
Nine months later, our lives
would never be the same.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.554
I take that back, dear.

25:40.555 --> 25:41.938
They became the same forever.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.174
Because of that
hellish curse, we

25:44.176 --> 25:48.679
were doomed to live the same
day over and over for eternity.

25:48.681 --> 25:49.780
[screaming]

25:49.782 --> 25:51.649
What's wrong, Sally?

25:51.651 --> 25:54.051
I am what is wrong.

25:59.125 --> 26:06.830
You can't wait to get
rid of it, can you?

26:06.832 --> 26:08.766
I hate the man who
did this to me.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.550
You can have it.

26:09.551 --> 26:10.333
I can have it.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.738
[cackling]

26:14.740 --> 26:17.074
I can have it.

26:17.076 --> 26:22.046
You would give me what's
already rightfully mine?

26:22.048 --> 26:30.688
It is I who is here just to
do the giving, little whore.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.223
Who could hate a baby?

26:33.225 --> 26:35.159
It's done nothing wrong.

26:35.161 --> 26:38.228
Can't help but be
born, can't help it.

26:38.230 --> 26:42.299
But its mother is a
semen-stealing wench.

26:44.837 --> 26:50.007
Perfect payback,
wouldn't you say?

26:50.009 --> 26:57.781
I curse you to be bound to
your bastard baby for eternity.

26:57.783 --> 27:04.355
And if you or yours
should ever end this bind,

27:04.357 --> 27:09.860
your whole family
line shall end.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.129
You will all perish.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.764
Sever the cord.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.166
[cackling]

27:16.168 --> 27:19.870
Sever the line.

27:19.872 --> 27:25.909
But if you keep your
pact, your whole family

27:25.911 --> 27:32.816
will be frozen in time at their
present ages for eternity,

27:32.818 --> 27:35.319
never to age.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.221
What about me, mistress?

27:37.223 --> 27:38.322
Will I age?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.723
Oh!

27:39.725 --> 27:43.227
[cackling]

27:44.664 --> 27:46.664
Yes.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.665
You will age, but
you will never die.

27:52.138 --> 27:57.141
You will live for eternity,
you little harlot.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.144
[music playing]

28:05.217 --> 28:07.685
[groaning]

28:13.726 --> 28:15.926
[cackling]

28:19.165 --> 28:21.732
[moaning]

28:28.374 --> 28:29.373
Sever the cord!

28:34.013 --> 28:37.448
So, here I sit for eternity.

28:39.952 --> 28:44.121
Every year, same show
over and over and over.

28:44.123 --> 28:48.192
You know, it's like
having eternal deja vu.

28:48.194 --> 28:53.430
You go, oh, that feels
like it's just happened,

28:53.432 --> 28:54.465
because it just did.

28:58.170 --> 29:03.440
And here I sit again, with
another one of you again

29:03.442 --> 29:05.242
in this contraption again.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.081
All right.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.418
Well, let's get started.

29:14.420 --> 29:19.022
Oh, we're going to get
this tube right here.

29:19.024 --> 29:22.025
And here's what I do.

29:22.027 --> 29:25.763
I take a little bit
of this, and I top it

29:25.765 --> 29:28.849
right off here into here.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.934
What it does is it makes your
joints catch on hell fire,

29:31.937 --> 29:34.338
and it makes your blood
just roast a little.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.775
But don't worry,
because you won't die.

29:37.777 --> 29:42.312
But I get a little
bit of variety,

29:42.314 --> 29:46.784
because everybody suffers
just a little bit different.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.452
OK, here we go.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.888
[cheering]

29:50.890 --> 29:53.323
[screaming]

29:53.325 --> 29:56.293
[baby crying]

29:57.196 --> 29:58.195
Go on.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.195
Go on.

29:59.196 --> 30:00.195
Shake that little derriere.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.015
Shake it.

30:01.016 --> 30:01.832
Shake it.

30:01.833 --> 30:02.649
Shake it.

30:02.650 --> 30:03.466
Shake it.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.370
[screaming]

30:06.372 --> 30:07.104
Good.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.477
Oh, Justice, she's
ready for her food.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.980
[music playing]

30:15.981 --> 30:18.482
(SINGING) We got a forklift
on the driveway, a big ass

30:18.484 --> 30:20.984
[inaudible] on the way.

30:20.986 --> 30:24.955
Like hell going to find
some backup because

30:24.957 --> 30:26.590
we've [inaudible] away.

30:26.592 --> 30:32.896
Don't have 16 professional
dancers or laser lights

30:32.898 --> 30:34.198
on display.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.834
But if you come
to the show, we're

30:36.836 --> 30:38.135
going to let you
know we're going--

30:38.137 --> 30:41.004
What can I get you, officer?

30:41.006 --> 30:43.140
Dude, if I'd known
it was your chopper,

30:43.142 --> 30:44.908
I never would've
let them boot it.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.910
Who boots a chopper, anyway?

30:46.912 --> 30:50.214
So, I guess a blow job's
out of the question?

30:50.216 --> 30:53.016
A comp light beer is out
of the question, bro.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.452
Did you work last night?

30:55.454 --> 30:56.987
Of course.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.521
Those girls back at
my table, did you

30:58.524 --> 30:59.857
see the guy that was with them?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.191
Not with them, but
the fine little nugget

31:01.193 --> 31:02.125
that was with them.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.496
How did he pay?

31:05.497 --> 31:08.866
Cash, big tip, so I'm inclined
to cover for him, if you say he

31:08.868 --> 31:11.401
killed the bitch or something.

31:11.403 --> 31:16.340
But I take it you're asking
because she's missing?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.009
Bingo.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.677
Yeah.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.345
Well, if I was him, I wouldn't
be done with her, neither.

31:21.347 --> 31:25.215
But like I said, I don't
really know who he is.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.617
I may have seen him around.

31:26.619 --> 31:27.918
Yeah.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.297
Thanks for your help.

31:29.298 --> 31:30.675
Thanks for your help.

31:30.676 --> 31:32.053
No wheels for two weeks
was great for my love life.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.423
Good for your upper thighs, too.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.458
Yeah, yeah.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.526
Thanks so much.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.593
Hey, walking's the best.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.095
M-hmm.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.897
Fuck you very much.

31:39.899 --> 31:43.367
[music playing]

31:43.369 --> 31:45.402
[footsteps]

31:49.675 --> 31:51.375
[sipping]

31:56.482 --> 32:00.584
I've seen a few slaves stretched
out on the road before them

32:00.586 --> 32:04.955
to question, and learned that
a very devout Christian man is

32:04.957 --> 32:08.125
his master.

32:08.126 --> 32:11.294
Hearing this, Candy admits
to himself, I'm through.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.430
I must give up paying loss.

32:13.432 --> 32:17.401
Optimism, after
all, it is a mania

32:17.403 --> 32:21.338
for saying things are
well when one is in hell.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.344
But when is one not so
much in hell, dear father?

32:32.618 --> 32:37.287
When one is with the one they're
meant to be with, I guess.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.693
Mama?

32:42.695 --> 32:45.595
No.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.098
It's all so bittersweet.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.535
You don't know what
fate means, do you?

32:51.537 --> 32:52.970
No.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.639
Fate means death.

32:55.641 --> 33:00.077
So to answer your question,
I don't guess anymore.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.279
I just sit and read.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.722
[sipping]

33:12.658 --> 33:14.491
[music playing]

33:14.493 --> 33:16.393
Look, she'd check
in by now, officer.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.128
But there's nothing
I can do officially

33:18.130 --> 33:19.847
unless we have more evidence.

33:19.848 --> 33:21.565
Man, you keep
fucking saying that.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.284
Look, I'll be frank.

33:23.285 --> 33:25.002
A lot of people come
here just to disappear.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.137
Hope didn't come
here to disappear.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.107
But what can we do?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.575
I'm not just going to sit here.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.346
Kris Kringle mother fucker.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.581
I'll go talk to her.

33:43.155 --> 33:43.687
Benay.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.492
Your friend is in real trouble.

33:48.494 --> 33:49.944
What?

33:49.945 --> 33:51.395
Who are you?

33:51.397 --> 33:53.764
I just got about 500
likes on my picture.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.535
I'm kinda Insta famous.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.070
Nice.

34:00.072 --> 34:03.573
I really like your beard.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.809
Thank you.

34:05.811 --> 34:09.446
Do you want to
come sit over here?

34:09.448 --> 34:10.047
Yeah.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.060
Look, I know you're trying.

34:23.062 --> 34:29.066
Benay's just really
uptight, you know?

34:29.068 --> 34:30.267
And you're not?

34:30.269 --> 34:33.403
No, I'm very relaxed.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.471
I was here last night.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.606
I saw her leave with him.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.141
You know the guy?

34:38.142 --> 34:39.675
We have a cop inside.

34:39.676 --> 34:41.209
That cop, he doesn't like
me, and I don't regard him.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.880
But you know the
guy with my friend?

34:42.881 --> 34:44.548
He's a local guy,
comes to town once

34:44.550 --> 34:50.787
a year during the festival,
so you don't have much hope.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.590
And I know Hope's having a
great time with that local guy.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.525
I mean, he's almost
old enough for me.

34:58.697 --> 35:02.399
Does that mean you
like older bad boys?

35:02.401 --> 35:06.636
Well, I prefer men over boys.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.773
I see.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.109
Am I in trouble, officer?

35:14.780 --> 35:18.615
I think we're both in trouble.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.616
Come here.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.523
Let's get out of here.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.758
My truck is parked around back.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.129
We'll have more room to
get to know each other.

35:32.131 --> 35:32.662
OK.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.501
Hello, YouTube.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.139
Oh, great.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.707
He knows where Hope is.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.142
I said no such thing.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.493
You just missed--

35:46.494 --> 35:47.843
This guy is a con man.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.280
Why don't you go peddle
your racket somewhere else

35:50.282 --> 35:52.216
across town, man?

35:52.217 --> 35:54.151
When you get through wasting
your time with this cop,

35:54.153 --> 35:55.719
use your [inaudible] to find me.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.560
What did he say?

36:03.562 --> 36:06.363
Nothing, a bunch of gibberish.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.842
Why are you so hostile, man?

36:07.843 --> 36:09.320
We're just trying
to find a friend.

36:09.321 --> 36:10.798
Look, you're not going to
find her by hanging out

36:10.802 --> 36:11.701
with the homeless.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.670
What did he say?

36:13.672 --> 36:16.206
Kool-Aid Griffith's
chicken feet.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.643
The claw.

36:23.348 --> 36:27.350
She is on a mission and
cannot be reasoned with.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.486
I'm sorry.

36:29.488 --> 36:35.192
Well, what about my truck?

36:35.194 --> 36:38.461
Can we follow them
and hide close by.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.264
Yeah, that's what
undercover cops do best.

36:41.266 --> 36:44.467
[music playing]

37:50.435 --> 37:53.637
[music playing]

38:08.387 --> 38:12.289
I fancy the brown
gravy on the meat.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.356
What do you think son?

38:13.358 --> 38:14.858
Oh, I love meat.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.326
[laughter]

38:17.929 --> 38:19.562
That's why I eat these.

38:19.564 --> 38:22.432
Oh, we got a vegetarian now.

38:22.434 --> 38:24.484
You have a problem with that?

38:24.485 --> 38:26.535
If the good Lord did not
want you dead animals,

38:26.538 --> 38:28.772
he wouldn't have made them
out of delicious meat.

38:28.774 --> 38:32.075
What does this little skinny
bitch know about food, anyway?

38:32.077 --> 38:35.478
I'm just saying, when's
the last time you actually

38:35.480 --> 38:37.614
killed something?

38:37.615 --> 38:39.749
Gar provides plenty
for this family.

38:39.751 --> 38:40.767
He's pretty.

38:40.768 --> 38:41.784
I'll give him that.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.853
I'll fucking kill you right now.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.044
Come on, then.

38:45.045 --> 38:46.234
That'll with
something, at least.

38:46.235 --> 38:47.424
Stop, stop.

38:47.426 --> 38:51.028
Look what you did.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.631
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly,
sweetheart, look at mama.

38:59.871 --> 39:00.837
Dolly.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.706
[sobbing]

39:02.708 --> 39:08.578
Oh, Dolly, when are you
going to get your new dolly?

39:08.580 --> 39:10.447
Look at mama.

39:10.449 --> 39:13.983
Look at me right now, right now.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.719
Are you looking?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.454
OK, you take a deep breath.

39:17.456 --> 39:17.987
Ah.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.892
Dolly, Dolly,
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.072
Dolly for Dolly.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.251
Dolly for Dolly.

39:27.252 --> 39:29.430
And when is Dolly going
to get a new dolly?

39:29.434 --> 39:30.400
Dolly for Dolly.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.102
Dolly for Dolly.

39:32.104 --> 39:34.371
Are you looking forward to it?

39:34.373 --> 39:35.839
Dolly for Dolly.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.906
Good girl.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.147
Gar, when is it going to be
ready to put in her room?

39:44.149 --> 39:46.015
Soon, mom.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.917
Soon.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.085
What?

39:49.087 --> 39:50.920
I'm going to an after hours.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.656
I want to be lean.

39:53.658 --> 39:56.459
That's pretty soon after
this day, don't you think?

39:56.461 --> 39:59.562
We have this
conversation every year.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.664
This is the best time of
the year to be invisible,

40:01.666 --> 40:03.833
and I want to go out.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.001
And every time you go out, you
put the entire family at risk.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.138
At risk of losing what?

40:08.140 --> 40:09.606
Only everything.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.140
That's all.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.078
I understand the stakes, mama.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.548
You carry this entire family
on your back every time

40:18.550 --> 40:20.517
you go out there.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.485
You eat your fucking egg.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.953
Shut the fuck up.

40:23.955 --> 40:24.921
Eat some meat.

40:28.693 --> 40:32.162
[music playing]

40:47.979 --> 40:50.580
Well, this is it.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.483
You think he beat us here?

40:53.485 --> 40:54.017
Hello?

40:58.190 --> 40:58.922
Hello?

41:21.480 --> 41:22.745
That's not possible.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.881
It doesn't make any sense.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.822
I know you met the chicken man.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.023
Jesus.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.759
This says he's dead.

41:36.761 --> 41:38.895
Who said he isn't?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.631
Follow me.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.801
[music playing]

41:52.777 --> 41:57.080
With all due respect, I
don't believe in any of this.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.749
Everything you are
experiencing and everything

41:59.751 --> 42:02.952
you will experience here
relates back to your quest.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.855
Did you bring the chicken foot?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.524
Place it on the table.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.070
[crashing]

42:25.110 --> 42:30.146
This is part of the
answer you're looking for.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.649
It's him.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.950
We've been here in
rural New Orleans

42:33.952 --> 42:38.021
for a very long, long time.

42:38.023 --> 42:41.558
The picture says 1838,
Burgundy, France.

42:44.863 --> 42:48.031
I told you I faded in that.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.098
What, no smile?

42:53.305 --> 42:56.573
You must be starving.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.107
[laughter]

42:58.109 --> 42:59.642
No, silly.

42:59.644 --> 43:01.110
I'm not going to
feed your mouth.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.783
Packed full of
sugar and nutrients.

43:06.785 --> 43:10.153
You're not just eating
for yourself now.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.593
[cackling]

43:16.595 --> 43:18.595
Sever the line.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.004
Your friend is the
only hope the family

43:28.006 --> 43:29.305
has to live in [inaudible].

43:29.307 --> 43:31.958
[baby crying]

43:31.959 --> 43:34.610
She is connected to
Blanche, now an old woman.

43:34.613 --> 43:36.746
[screaming]

43:36.748 --> 43:39.115
And her bastard baby.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.884
They must keep the baby
nourished with youthful blood

43:41.886 --> 43:45.088
in order to survive themselves.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.624
She's slurping again,
the filthy whore.

43:58.970 --> 44:03.773
The good news for you is
we require your services

44:03.775 --> 44:10.780
for a full year, and then get
your party, just like Brianna.

44:10.782 --> 44:13.750
You remember Brianna's
party, don't you?

44:13.752 --> 44:17.854
I want you to really
feel this, Bri.

44:17.856 --> 44:21.991
This is my gift to you
after all this time.

44:24.362 --> 44:29.799
My family is the only thing
that stands between you

44:29.801 --> 44:31.668
and the end of your life.

44:31.670 --> 44:32.402
Is that clear?

44:35.740 --> 44:41.711
We are everything to you.

44:41.713 --> 44:46.149
And remember, we didn't
ask for anything,

44:46.151 --> 44:48.384
so we won't feel guilty
about any of it, either.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.322
Isn't that right, sugar pie?

44:53.324 --> 44:57.060
[cackling]

44:57.762 --> 44:58.327
That's right.

45:01.199 --> 45:08.705
A good girl cannot be seduced
by another woman's man.

45:08.707 --> 45:13.142
Only a rank,
condemnable, coquette

45:13.144 --> 45:22.351
can commit such a heresy, a
girl with a heart of a whore.

45:22.353 --> 45:28.357
And that will be the girl
required to complete the bond.

45:28.359 --> 45:32.145
My friend is no whore.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.932
They're all whores now, sleeping
around, wearing flashy clothes.

45:35.934 --> 45:37.400
Where the hell is she?

45:37.402 --> 45:39.202
That's right.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.870
What?

45:40.872 --> 45:42.739
She's in hell.

45:48.012 --> 45:50.513
Look, I'll believe in all
this if it gets Hope back.

45:50.515 --> 45:53.750
You expect us to believe
that you are the 200-year-old

45:53.752 --> 45:55.241
boyfriend--

45:55.242 --> 45:56.731
Wait, wait.

45:56.732 --> 45:58.221
I think I should explain my
ulterior motive at this point.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.489
No, don't.

45:59.490 --> 46:00.756
We just want our friend back.

46:00.757 --> 46:02.023
We don't need all this shit.

46:02.024 --> 46:03.290
I don't care who or
what you think you are.

46:03.294 --> 46:05.027
Consider the facts.

46:05.029 --> 46:07.163
You met with him, you
sat down with the guy,

46:07.164 --> 46:09.298
you let him buy your drinks
while he gained your trust

46:09.300 --> 46:11.067
and seduced your friend.

46:11.068 --> 46:12.835
And you both know that
ain't no voodoo mumbo jumbo.

46:12.837 --> 46:14.637
But all of this is just fucked.

46:14.638 --> 46:16.438
Well, you don't have to
pretend to believe any of this.

46:16.441 --> 46:20.810
We both want to find Hope
for very different reasons.

46:20.812 --> 46:22.445
OK, then, magic man.

46:22.447 --> 46:25.047
You seem to know this town
like the back your hand.

46:25.049 --> 46:26.449
Look, it's not as
simple as that.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.118
Of course it's not.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.786
Oh, but let me
guess, you want money

46:29.788 --> 46:32.155
from us for your
voodoo mumbo jumbo.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.990
It's not that simple.

46:33.991 --> 46:35.824
Since the family
has what they have,

46:35.827 --> 46:37.393
they don't have to
hunt for another year.

46:37.395 --> 46:39.328
Now, unless you can get
the New Orleans Police

46:39.330 --> 46:41.397
Department to go house
to house, your friend

46:41.399 --> 46:44.167
is about to experience
a year of unholy hell.

46:44.169 --> 46:45.835
We're going to find
our friend, OK?

46:45.837 --> 46:48.021
We're going to go
on the internet,

46:48.022 --> 46:50.206
tell the whole
world if we have to.

46:50.208 --> 46:52.842
You know, I've danced this
dance for a very long time

46:52.844 --> 46:54.343
that I know all of your moves.

46:54.345 --> 46:57.146
Before the internet,
they tried TV and radio.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.215
Before that, the newspaper.

46:59.216 --> 47:01.283
And before that, they posted
signs and the family held

47:01.286 --> 47:03.831
vigils.

47:03.832 --> 47:06.377
Well, if it's that hopeless,
then why are you telling us?

47:06.378 --> 47:08.923
Because we have one shot,
the daughter, and they

47:08.927 --> 47:10.993
call her Amelia.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.830
She's a vile sadist, and
she thinks sex is violence,

47:13.832 --> 47:14.931
and she'll be out tonight.

47:14.933 --> 47:17.033
And how do you know that?

47:17.034 --> 47:19.134
Because it's the last
night of Mardi Gras,

47:19.135 --> 47:21.235
and it's the last night that
she can be out yet be invisible.

47:21.239 --> 47:23.039
Why don't we show the
picture to the cop?

47:23.041 --> 47:24.240
He seems to want to help.

47:24.242 --> 47:25.692
Help?

47:25.693 --> 47:27.143
In this town, the cops
are a bigger menace

47:27.145 --> 47:28.311
than the bad guys.

47:32.383 --> 47:35.802
Are you Cinderella?

47:35.803 --> 47:39.222
Because I definitely see that
dress coming off at midnight.

47:39.224 --> 47:39.589
What?

47:42.260 --> 47:46.529
Your father must be a baker,
because you've got great buns.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.164
[scoffing]

47:50.501 --> 47:52.602
Shouldn't we be going
to some clubs looking

47:52.604 --> 47:55.137
for that guy, something?

47:57.475 --> 47:58.608
You look like my mother.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.578
Wow.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.446
OK.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.331
[laughter]

48:05.332 --> 48:07.215
It worked like it
worked for my daughter.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.334
Huh?

48:08.335 --> 48:09.451
It worked for my daughter.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.453
That's not funny.

48:10.455 --> 48:11.320
No, no.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.356
No, no.

48:13.357 --> 48:15.391
I mean, I ran them by her,
and she, she approved.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.526
I know you're looking at
some weird pickup line

48:17.528 --> 48:19.095
website on your phone.

48:19.097 --> 48:20.897
I'm not, really.

48:20.899 --> 48:22.482
Well, I mean, I'm not.

48:22.483 --> 48:24.066
I can literally
see it right there.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.534
[laughter]

48:25.536 --> 48:28.170
Well, let's see here.

48:28.172 --> 48:31.574
Your daddy must be a drug
dealer, because you're dope.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.042
I want to try that one.

48:33.044 --> 48:34.010
Oh my god.

48:34.011 --> 48:34.977
That's my wife texting.

48:34.979 --> 48:36.279
Oh.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.580
I need to find my friends now.

48:40.451 --> 48:45.021
Your ass is so nice that it's
a shame you have to sit on it.

48:45.023 --> 48:46.389
All right, all right, all right.

48:46.391 --> 48:48.007
Start the car.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.624
We need to find the sister
tonight before the family goes

48:49.627 --> 48:51.811
in for another year.

48:51.812 --> 48:53.996
And there are three after-hour
joints we need to hit tonight.

48:53.998 --> 48:56.015
[honking]

48:56.016 --> 48:58.033
I think your friend
just rolled up.

Dolly for Dolly.

50:28.593 --> 50:29.592
Dolly for Dolly.

50:39.437 --> 50:44.040
(SINGING) Old
MacDonald had a farm.

Dolly for Dolly.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.046
Dolly for Dolly.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.615
And on his farm, he had a Dolly.

Dolly for Dolly.

51:20.111 --> 51:22.144
Dolly for Dolly.

51:22.146 --> 51:23.379
Yeah.

51:23.381 --> 51:25.347
I knew you'd be awake, Dolly.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.750
I just knew it.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.452
Look at them eyes.

51:32.190 --> 51:33.489
Ain't she pretty, Dolly?

51:36.594 --> 51:37.626
Dolly for Dolly.

51:41.365 --> 51:44.333
I knew you'd like her, Dolly.

51:48.539 --> 51:48.988
I just knew it.

51:48.989 --> 51:49.438
Hey, Dolly.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.942
Listen.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.445
Mr. [inaudible] Dolly.

51:59.217 --> 52:00.683
You got to stop
doing that, Dolly.

52:22.907 --> 52:25.641
[music playing]

53:07.351 --> 53:09.218
So what's the plan?

53:09.220 --> 53:11.270
The plan is to find
the sister tonight

53:11.271 --> 53:13.321
in one of the after-hours
club and follow her back home.

53:13.324 --> 53:14.890
And are you thinking
Red Stamp, homeboy?

53:14.892 --> 53:16.759
Yeah, or Johnny's, or Absinthe.

53:16.761 --> 53:18.661
OK.

53:18.662 --> 53:20.562
If we find her, I can't take her
into custody on a voodoo whim.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.464
Her custody don't get
that girl, anyway.

53:22.466 --> 53:26.335
When we find her, we have to
let her lead us to her home.

53:26.337 --> 53:27.820
That's no good.

53:27.821 --> 53:29.304
I mean, then, I'm in a
home without a warrant.

53:29.307 --> 53:31.118
I hit Absinthe.

53:31.119 --> 53:32.930
These ladies will hit
the Stamp, and you

53:32.931 --> 53:34.742
can hang at Johnny's with her.

53:34.745 --> 53:36.679
We can do that.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.214
We can be good?

53:38.216 --> 53:39.315
We can be great.

53:39.317 --> 53:42.785
[music playing]

53:53.397 --> 53:54.530
All right.

53:54.531 --> 53:55.664
You want a drink?

53:55.665 --> 53:56.798
How about one of
those energy drinks?

53:56.801 --> 53:57.700
I am beat.

53:57.702 --> 53:59.301
Yeah.

53:59.303 --> 54:01.270
Two White Ladies, please.

54:01.272 --> 54:03.405
Why they got to be white?

54:03.407 --> 54:05.341
It's so 1990s.

54:05.343 --> 54:06.742
Get over it.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.788
I think that's all there
is in here is ladies.

54:28.532 --> 54:30.566
In which case.

54:30.568 --> 54:34.703
Thanks Lafitte for
choosing this bar for us.

54:34.705 --> 54:37.806
We're the right
demographic, aren't we?

54:37.808 --> 54:40.609
Speak for yourself.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.544
Cheers.

54:42.546 --> 54:44.313
This place is dead.

54:44.315 --> 54:46.282
We can go somewhere else.

54:46.284 --> 54:48.817
Well, we're on a stakeout.

54:48.819 --> 54:52.288
Maybe we should drink
and see if she shows up.

54:52.290 --> 54:53.822
Oh, that's a good idea.

54:53.824 --> 54:58.527
Hey, let's drink heavily
and smoke some weed.

54:58.529 --> 54:59.995
Don't say that so loud.

54:59.997 --> 55:00.996
I'm a cop.

55:00.998 --> 55:04.033
[music playing]

55:15.446 --> 55:16.645
Come on.

55:23.454 --> 55:25.454
So his band plays what?

55:25.456 --> 55:27.323
Cowboy punk.

55:27.325 --> 55:29.108
Never heard of that.

55:29.109 --> 55:30.892
What makes cowboy
punk so unique is

55:30.895 --> 55:36.732
the juxtaposition of brevity,
and core construction,

55:36.734 --> 55:39.902
and horses.

55:39.904 --> 55:41.904
Interesting.

55:41.906 --> 55:44.973
That's actually a joke.

55:44.975 --> 55:47.776
Maybe in Idaho.

55:47.778 --> 55:50.246
Great news.

55:50.247 --> 55:52.715
You're up to Wayne's completely
unjustified skinny rocker

55:52.717 --> 55:55.617
ego-inflated standards.

55:55.619 --> 55:57.653
Very unjustified, I'd say.

55:57.655 --> 56:01.357
What's it like, living
in this dark crazy place?

56:01.359 --> 56:04.727
It's like black
magic all the time,

56:04.729 --> 56:08.364
like living in a
dream for 200 years.

56:08.366 --> 56:10.899
Wayne and I are really
into the occult.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.735
I know.

56:12.737 --> 56:14.603
How?

56:14.605 --> 56:18.941
Do what thou wilt, the
most hated man in England.

56:18.943 --> 56:21.677
Love him.

56:21.678 --> 56:24.412
(SINGING) Life without
apologies, or judgment,

56:24.415 --> 56:26.582
or holding back.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.584
I knew you were into Crowley.

56:28.586 --> 56:32.054
I actually bought him that
t-shirt at a flea market.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.523
In Boise?

56:34.525 --> 56:36.392
Do you know about Annie Ringler?

56:36.394 --> 56:38.628
No.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.863
She was a beautiful
young Hungarian girl

56:40.865 --> 56:43.932
Crawley met while
touring Moscow.

56:43.934 --> 56:48.670
He wrote in his journal she had
passed beyond the region where

56:48.672 --> 56:50.672
pleasure had meaning for her.

56:50.674 --> 56:53.175
She could only
feel through pain.

56:53.177 --> 56:57.179
My own means of making her happy
was to inflict physical cruelty

56:57.181 --> 57:00.082
as she directed.

57:00.084 --> 57:02.918
As she directed?

57:02.920 --> 57:06.688
I doubt pleasure has much
meaning to you anymore.

57:09.693 --> 57:13.629
Pleasure's a half a dozen
1:00 AM gut-busting sliders

57:13.631 --> 57:16.432
after her night of
rum and Coke and blow.

57:16.434 --> 57:16.965
Whoa.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.075
Time to go?

57:27.077 --> 57:27.810
Yes.

57:33.551 --> 57:34.683
Meet me outside.

57:37.087 --> 57:37.986
Oh, men.

57:42.893 --> 57:45.194
Here.

57:45.196 --> 57:46.562
What's this?

57:46.564 --> 57:49.465
It's absinthe.

57:49.467 --> 57:52.568
Is that real, Wormwood?

57:52.570 --> 57:55.637
Blended it morphine,
family recipe.

57:55.639 --> 57:58.807
Yes, it's real, from
back in the day.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.710
I always wanted
to try this shit.

58:01.712 --> 58:03.479
I'd like to meet your family.

58:06.517 --> 58:08.750
So you're a madam?

58:08.752 --> 58:11.220
A lifestyle dominatrix.

58:11.222 --> 58:13.789
They have those
where you're from?

58:13.791 --> 58:18.160
Cowboys can be very naughty.

58:18.162 --> 58:23.632
Well, at least you already
have saddles and straps around.

58:23.634 --> 58:27.636
You know, you could be a
good one if you wanted.

58:27.638 --> 58:28.770
You've got the look.

58:30.908 --> 58:33.642
I've never thought
much of dominatrix.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.777
No offense, I just
don't like play acting.

58:38.716 --> 58:42.918
It can seem real.

58:42.920 --> 58:47.723
I wonder if you
could handle real.

58:47.725 --> 58:50.158
Fuck, I can handle real.

58:50.160 --> 58:50.893
Let's go.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.577
[gasps]

59:08.579 --> 59:09.945
That's the girl from the photo.

59:09.947 --> 59:11.797
OK.

59:11.798 --> 59:13.648
To remind you, until we find
anything, I'm just a driver.

59:13.651 --> 59:14.182
Let's go.

59:25.696 --> 59:27.696
[scoffs]

59:27.698 --> 59:31.099
Like I'm floating, dude.

59:31.101 --> 59:33.902
Keep it down.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.388
Wow.

59:36.389 --> 59:38.873
Werewolf's Guide to Life, The
Necromaniac Ritual Rulebook,

59:38.876 --> 59:42.978
The Intro to
Civil-Borne Spirits?

59:42.980 --> 59:46.715
My family has always been open
to different ways of thinking.

59:46.717 --> 59:52.888
Fucking a, always love models.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.656
This one come in a box?

59:54.658 --> 59:57.793
Hardly.

59:57.794 --> 1:00:00.929
This is a hand replica of the
greatest cathedral in Russia.

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:02.731
I got some good
things around here.

1:00:02.733 --> 1:00:04.232
[clattering]

1:00:05.636 --> 1:00:07.135
Now, you've done it.

1:00:07.137 --> 1:00:08.270
Well, I can fix it.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:12.991
Fuck.

1:00:12.992 --> 1:00:14.875
The second we confirm that
Hope is here, we call the cops.

1:00:14.878 --> 1:00:16.745
We have a cop here.

1:00:16.746 --> 1:00:18.613
Yeah, well he seems to be
a little bit more concerned

1:00:18.616 --> 1:00:20.148
with some other
constitutional issues.

1:00:20.150 --> 1:00:21.249
[inaudible]

1:00:21.251 --> 1:00:22.751
Hey, guys, come on.

1:00:22.753 --> 1:00:24.069
Keep up.

1:00:24.070 --> 1:00:25.386
I'm not kidding around, OK?

1:00:25.389 --> 1:00:26.788
What if we get cursed?

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:29.658
Are you serious?

1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:30.892
No.

1:00:30.894 --> 1:00:32.361
Fuck it, let's go.

1:00:32.363 --> 1:00:34.730
Let's go.

1:00:34.732 --> 1:00:36.098
You know, it really
doesn't seem right

1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:37.733
that we're not out
there searching

1:00:37.735 --> 1:00:38.767
with them [inaudible].

1:00:38.769 --> 1:00:40.252
What do you mean?

1:00:40.253 --> 1:00:41.736
It's called the
division of labor.

1:00:41.739 --> 1:00:43.872
Didn't you learn
that in college?

1:00:43.874 --> 1:00:46.942
We're literally just
sitting here, though.

1:00:46.944 --> 1:00:50.979
You know, I have kind
of a crick in my neck.

1:00:50.981 --> 1:00:53.248
Is there a way you could,
like, rub it a little bit?

1:00:53.250 --> 1:00:55.117
No.

1:00:55.119 --> 1:00:56.718
Just a little, just right here?

1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:58.186
No, that comes with old age.

1:00:58.188 --> 1:01:01.056
What do you mean it
comes with old age?

1:01:01.058 --> 1:01:04.393
You know, this is part
of my undercover outfit.

1:01:04.395 --> 1:01:06.595
This is just a prop.

1:01:06.596 --> 1:01:08.796
It's a costume,
not a real beard.

1:01:08.799 --> 1:01:09.798
Ow!

1:01:09.799 --> 1:01:10.798
[laughter]

1:01:10.801 --> 1:01:13.235
Seems pretty real to me.

1:01:13.237 --> 1:01:17.305
Well, it was prematurely
gray when I was 17.

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:19.274
[laughter]

1:01:22.413 --> 1:01:25.681
Hey, want to see
a real dominatrix?

1:01:29.219 --> 1:01:33.955
Missy, I need to prepare you
for what's about to happen.

1:01:33.957 --> 1:01:35.290
What's about to happen?

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:38.026
Sit down.

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:41.096
You know, the dark
arts are all based

1:01:41.098 --> 1:01:45.867
on real acts, cruel
ones from long ago,

1:01:45.869 --> 1:01:49.271
updated into games and play.

1:01:49.273 --> 1:01:51.239
Like the cat o' nine.

1:01:51.241 --> 1:01:51.973
Exactly.

1:01:55.312 --> 1:01:58.714
Now, it's made out of
velvet or whatever.

1:01:58.716 --> 1:02:03.452
The real cat o' nine, would
strip skin off the sinner

1:02:03.454 --> 1:02:06.755
until he confessed a full
measure of his transgressions.

1:02:12.896 --> 1:02:15.263
Who's this guy, the butler?

1:02:15.265 --> 1:02:16.732
[scoffing]

1:02:16.734 --> 1:02:17.299
The butler.

1:02:25.442 --> 1:02:26.174
OK.

1:02:53.437 --> 1:02:55.621
The door's locked.

1:02:55.622 --> 1:02:57.806
I think you can get
into that room up there.

1:02:57.808 --> 1:03:00.375
That we can get into?

1:03:00.377 --> 1:03:01.810
You're the most athletic.

1:03:01.812 --> 1:03:03.495
It would be easy.

1:03:03.496 --> 1:03:05.179
I can get you onto
the top of this porch.

1:03:05.182 --> 1:03:07.282
The window's right over it.

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.383
All you do is climb in, but
don't do anything [inaudible]..

1:03:09.386 --> 1:03:11.486
Just come to this back
door and let us in.

1:03:11.488 --> 1:03:14.389
Don't worry about that.

1:03:14.391 --> 1:03:16.358
It shouldn't be too hard.

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:18.193
No.

1:03:18.194 --> 1:03:20.027
Just a bunch of century-old
vampires in there sleeping.

1:03:20.030 --> 1:03:21.429
Not vampires.

1:03:21.431 --> 1:03:22.764
They're that old.

1:03:22.765 --> 1:03:24.098
Why does it matter if
they're vampires or not?

1:03:24.101 --> 1:03:25.801
It doesn't matter.

1:03:25.803 --> 1:03:28.403
Which they're not.

1:03:28.405 --> 1:03:30.405
Right?

1:03:30.407 --> 1:03:31.740
Come on.

1:03:31.741 --> 1:03:33.074
Let's go.

1:03:33.075 --> 1:03:34.408
I'll help you up.

1:03:34.411 --> 1:03:34.988
Ready?

1:03:34.989 --> 1:03:35.566
Yeah.

1:03:35.567 --> 1:03:36.144
Go on.

1:03:38.882 --> 1:03:42.083
[music playing]

1:03:50.093 --> 1:03:51.126
More absinthe?

1:03:56.366 --> 1:04:00.168
What are you doing with
that fucking loser?

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:02.137
He got me out of the
sticks, didn't he?

1:04:11.315 --> 1:04:14.115
You need to know that
you can handle this.

1:04:14.117 --> 1:04:17.519
Pretending to be a dominatrix
won't cut it in this house.

1:04:17.521 --> 1:04:19.287
What do you mean?

1:04:19.289 --> 1:04:24.860
I'm going to destroy your guy.

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:27.262
I don't think he'd like that.

1:04:27.264 --> 1:04:28.897
You'll have to see for yourself.

1:04:48.485 --> 1:04:51.186
You can handle this.

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:52.420
I can handle anything.

1:04:55.325 --> 1:04:57.926
In 10 minutes, Justice
will come for you.

1:06:04.294 --> 1:06:05.560
There's fucking dead people.

1:06:10.689 --> 1:06:11.878
Oh my God, Katie.

1:06:11.879 --> 1:06:13.068
Why don't you call
the cops [inaudible]??

1:06:30.687 --> 1:06:31.419
Hello?

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:34.689
Hello?

1:06:41.131 --> 1:06:46.034
You know, we never
agreed on a safe word.

1:06:46.036 --> 1:06:47.268
A what?

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:55.477
God damn, that's an outfit.

1:07:01.785 --> 1:07:07.555
A safe word, like globule.

1:07:07.557 --> 1:07:09.457
That means stop.

1:07:09.459 --> 1:07:13.561
Why would I want to do that?

1:07:13.563 --> 1:07:17.032
Well, it's actually more for
me than you, to be honest.

1:07:20.804 --> 1:07:25.407
For you, of course,
playing games.

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:32.747
This thing's kind
of uncomfortable.

1:07:32.749 --> 1:07:35.550
Kind of uncomfortable?

1:07:35.552 --> 1:07:38.286
Yes.

1:07:38.288 --> 1:07:40.188
Well, that's no good.

1:07:40.190 --> 1:07:44.726
It's supposed to be
terribly uncomfortable.

1:07:49.099 --> 1:07:51.099
[grunting]

1:07:56.273 --> 1:08:01.509
Oh, now meet my favorite knife.

1:08:04.648 --> 1:08:06.414
Wait, wait, wait.

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:08.750
This is like theater, right?

1:08:08.752 --> 1:08:09.818
Right?

1:08:09.820 --> 1:08:12.520
[heavy breathing]

1:08:18.728 --> 1:08:20.428
[groaning]

1:08:23.834 --> 1:08:27.202
So the fat people in
Japan, they had this sport,

1:08:27.204 --> 1:08:28.353
and it's got, like soap--

1:08:28.354 --> 1:08:29.503
There's something out there.

1:08:29.506 --> 1:08:31.573
What?

1:08:31.574 --> 1:08:33.641
Right over there, right there.

1:08:33.643 --> 1:08:36.778
I don't see anything.

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:37.679
At least there was.

1:08:37.681 --> 1:08:38.680
I don't know.

1:08:38.682 --> 1:08:41.116
OK, OK.

1:08:41.118 --> 1:08:42.000
All right.

1:08:42.001 --> 1:08:42.883
I will go out and check.

1:08:42.886 --> 1:08:44.369
OK.

1:08:44.370 --> 1:08:45.853
And if you see something
just, I don't know,

1:08:45.856 --> 1:08:47.255
flash the headlights, all right?

1:08:47.257 --> 1:08:48.523
Yeah, OK.

1:08:54.397 --> 1:08:57.799
How about a kiss for luck?

1:08:57.801 --> 1:09:00.268
Maybe when you get back.

1:09:00.270 --> 1:09:01.770
OK.

1:09:01.771 --> 1:09:03.271
All right, cool.

1:09:48.952 --> 1:09:50.652
[phone bleeps]

1:09:55.458 --> 1:09:58.660
[frogs croaking]

1:10:01.932 --> 1:10:03.631
OK.

1:10:03.633 --> 1:10:05.550
OK.

1:10:05.551 --> 1:10:07.468
It's going to be OK.

1:10:07.470 --> 1:10:08.870
Everything's going to be fine.

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:16.744
[screaming]

1:10:19.616 --> 1:10:21.883
[dinging]

1:10:21.885 --> 1:10:23.384
[music playing]

1:10:23.386 --> 1:10:25.220
Tina, answer the phone.

1:10:25.222 --> 1:10:27.655
You have to answer the phone.

1:10:27.657 --> 1:10:29.724
[dinging]

1:10:34.631 --> 1:10:35.997
[cackling]

1:10:42.906 --> 1:10:45.406
[screaming]

1:10:45.408 --> 1:10:47.642
Shh, shh, shh.

1:10:51.381 --> 1:10:52.914
[snaps]

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:20.942
It's real.

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:22.543
Something's not right.

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:27.415
[muttering]

1:11:27.417 --> 1:11:28.650
The left ear.

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:31.819
Here.

1:11:37.694 --> 1:11:39.027
[giggling]

1:11:44.934 --> 1:11:46.634
[sighs]

1:11:49.839 --> 1:11:52.874
[screaming]

1:11:54.811 --> 1:11:57.312
Ah.

1:11:57.314 --> 1:11:59.080
Symmetry.

1:11:59.082 --> 1:12:00.315
Very nice.

1:12:05.722 --> 1:12:07.722
Come on.

1:12:07.724 --> 1:12:09.090
[grunts]

1:12:26.976 --> 1:12:28.009
I know you.

1:12:28.011 --> 1:12:29.777
It's been a while.

1:12:33.116 --> 1:12:34.749
You're the one who did this.

1:12:34.751 --> 1:12:39.654
I'm the one who can free you.

1:12:39.656 --> 1:12:42.090
How?

1:12:42.092 --> 1:12:44.625
How can you stop it?

1:12:44.627 --> 1:12:52.600
When I reclaim what is mine,
the thing ends, and then you

1:12:52.602 --> 1:12:56.637
can finally sleep, grandma.

1:12:56.639 --> 1:13:00.074
Now, wouldn't that be nice?

1:13:00.076 --> 1:13:01.676
[gasps]

1:13:07.417 --> 1:13:11.486
And the baby, the baby
will be all right?

1:13:11.488 --> 1:13:14.555
You wouldn't have
to let anybody know.

1:13:14.557 --> 1:13:16.023
Just let me finish.

1:13:20.130 --> 1:13:22.864
All right.

1:13:22.866 --> 1:13:23.931
All right.

1:13:27.837 --> 1:13:28.870
All right.

1:13:53.997 --> 1:13:55.830
You must be Hope.

1:13:55.832 --> 1:13:56.197
Hmm.

1:13:59.569 --> 1:14:02.737
It's almost over now, Hope.

1:14:02.739 --> 1:14:10.111
The unholy trinity, I can't
leave any witnesses, can I?

1:14:10.113 --> 1:14:13.147
[choking]

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:21.122
[grunting]

1:14:24.594 --> 1:14:27.762
[baby crying]

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:40.041
What's your name?

1:14:43.012 --> 1:14:45.012
Oh, Lafitte.

1:14:45.014 --> 1:14:47.014
[screaming]

1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:58.626
You always hated this baby,
but it was always mine.

1:14:58.628 --> 1:15:06.801
And with my blood, it
will continue to live.

1:15:08.938 --> 1:15:14.642
But that, that's great
news for you, my dear,

1:15:14.644 --> 1:15:17.178
because we don't
need you anymore.

1:15:22.919 --> 1:15:29.924
So when I sever this connection,
I sever my connection

1:15:29.926 --> 1:15:32.660
with this wretched family.

1:15:32.662 --> 1:15:35.062
Sever the cord.

1:15:35.064 --> 1:15:40.835
Finally, finally,
after all these years.

1:15:40.837 --> 1:15:42.203
Took a long time.

1:15:42.205 --> 1:15:43.871
[gunshots]

1:15:43.873 --> 1:15:45.239
[thud]

1:15:47.677 --> 1:15:49.911
[baby crying]

1:15:53.149 --> 1:15:56.183
[music playing]

1:16:17.307 --> 1:16:19.040
[squeaking]

1:16:26.783 --> 1:16:29.984
[weeping]

1:16:33.222 --> 1:16:35.723
I hear.

1:16:35.725 --> 1:16:37.758
I hear you.

1:16:42.031 --> 1:16:43.581
I'm going to come
get you right now.

1:16:43.582 --> 1:16:45.132
My sweet son Gar left me a
little present in the barn,

1:16:45.134 --> 1:16:51.272
knowing my 65th birthday was
right around the corner again.

1:16:51.274 --> 1:16:53.992
I liked her.

1:16:53.993 --> 1:16:56.711
This one was perky and
smart, full of drive

1:16:56.713 --> 1:16:59.080
and determination,
not glazed over

1:16:59.082 --> 1:17:01.949
by drunkenness like the others.

1:17:01.951 --> 1:17:05.653
Our family needed a
replacement, and I

1:17:05.655 --> 1:17:09.056
felt she may actually
be good company.

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:42.189
Shh.

1:17:42.191 --> 1:17:43.290
Don't worry, honey.

1:17:45.895 --> 1:17:48.763
Get some beauty sleep.

1:17:48.765 --> 1:17:51.232
It's going to be a
long year for you.

1:17:59.142 --> 1:18:00.708
[snaps]

1:18:19.362 --> 1:18:21.095
Welcome to the family.

1:18:23.866 --> 1:18:25.833
(SINGING) Run if you want.

1:18:25.835 --> 1:18:30.204
You won't get away
from me this time.

1:18:34.243 --> 1:18:37.745
Don't be afraid
if what you want.

1:18:37.747 --> 1:18:44.051
I know your deepest
darkest side.

1:18:44.053 --> 1:18:49.724
And you know what it
takes to free your soul.

1:18:52.128 --> 1:19:02.436
Distracted by [inaudible]
sacrificing you, you know.

1:19:02.438 --> 1:19:12.179
Who you go through the
deepest hell [inaudible]

1:19:12.181 --> 1:19:21.388
Will you wallow through
the deepest darkest hue?

1:19:21.390 --> 1:19:30.397
Will you latch on to through
the deepest hell in you?

1:19:30.399 --> 1:19:40.474
Will you go through the
deepest hell in you?

1:19:40.476 --> 1:19:42.810
[music playing]

1:19:46.883 --> 1:19:48.415
(SINGING) Burning alive.

1:19:56.826 --> 1:19:58.893
Friends all gone.

1:19:58.895 --> 1:20:00.928
Friends all gone.

1:20:00.930 --> 1:20:05.432
Caught in self-destruction.

1:20:05.434 --> 1:20:09.503
I was drawn.

1:20:09.504 --> 1:20:13.573
I was drawn but the demon
inside is burning alive.

1:20:16.512 --> 1:20:17.478
Burning alive.

1:20:20.449 --> 1:20:21.448
Burning alive.

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:25.186
Burning alive.

1:20:29.292 --> 1:20:33.961
Can you see through
my disguise of mine?

1:20:33.963 --> 1:20:36.964
I'm coming undone.

1:20:36.966 --> 1:20:42.870
Feel the anger deep inside
as [inaudible] this hell

1:20:42.872 --> 1:20:44.104
has begun.

1:20:44.106 --> 1:20:47.842
Burning alive.

1:20:47.844 --> 1:20:48.843
Burning alive.

1:20:53.850 --> 1:20:56.250
We complain.

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:57.985
We complain.

1:20:57.987 --> 1:21:01.922
Fate has brought us down again.

1:21:01.924 --> 1:21:03.591
Who's to blame?

1:21:03.593 --> 1:21:08.379
Who's to blame?

1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:13.166
Only what I can't
find is burning alive!

1:21:13.169 --> 1:21:14.535
I'm burning alive.

1:21:17.473 --> 1:21:20.474
Burning alive.

1:21:20.476 --> 1:21:22.209
I'm burning alive.

1:21:25.915 --> 1:21:30.584
Can you see through
my disguise of mine?

1:21:30.586 --> 1:21:33.420
I'm coming undone.

1:21:33.422 --> 1:21:39.593
Feel the anger deep inside
as [inaudible] this hell

1:21:39.595 --> 1:21:41.896
has begun.

1:21:41.898 --> 1:21:49.570
Hollow in my self-destruction,
I have only one life to give.

1:21:49.572 --> 1:21:57.044
Make it through just one more
day if I can hold on to it.

1:21:57.046 --> 1:22:00.047
I'm burning alive.

1:22:00.049 --> 1:22:01.415
Burning alive.

1:22:22.204 --> 1:22:25.940
Can you see through
my disguise of mine?

1:22:25.942 --> 1:22:28.208
I'm coming undone.

1:22:28.210 --> 1:22:29.677
Coming undone.

1:22:29.679 --> 1:22:32.479
Feel the anger deep inside.
