WEBVTT

01:04.189 --> 01:06.733
Allow me to introduce my game to you.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.863
This game,
the one that we're all about to play,

01:11.946 --> 01:13.281
is called…

01:13.364 --> 01:15.325
…The Queen of Croquet!

01:16.743 --> 01:17.911
Croquet?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.997
Lawn billiards
is what they used to call it

01:21.081 --> 01:24.209
in 19th-century England,
at the height of its popularity.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.338
I don't believe that it was ever
quite so popular in Japan.

01:29.714 --> 01:30.965
We don't know the rules.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.928
That's all right.
You don't really need to.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.013
Don't worry.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.725
It doesn't matter which one of us wins!

01:41.476 --> 01:42.352
What?

01:43.728 --> 01:45.939
Clearing Croquet is simple.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.357
You just have to complete

01:47.440 --> 01:50.693
three little sets of croquet games
without withdrawing.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.239
If you decide to give up, game over.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.074
Weapons are also allowed here.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.159
It's so simple.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.371
Just three little rounds of croquet.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.293
W-- We just have to finish three rounds?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
We don't even have to win?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.632
Exactly! Simple, huh?

02:15.176 --> 02:17.846
Now, why don't we begin?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.715
Each side has two balls,

03:35.798 --> 03:38.384
one blue and black,
the other red and yellow.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.805
To win, you need to pass your balls
through the six hoops in a certain order,

03:42.889 --> 03:46.643
then hit the final finishing peg
before your opponent does.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.006
Yes!

04:24.013 --> 04:27.016
The first set's mine.
Better luck next time.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.356
We clear the game
by finishing three sets without quitting.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.025
I'm not gonna forfeit.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.861
There are two sets left.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.698
What is she thinking?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.664
All right, round two now.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.522
It looks like she's dragging
the game out, making it last.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.109
I think she's playing with us.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.278
I need to get a move on.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.715
Oh! This is so much fun!

05:44.302 --> 05:45.845
Lovely!

05:47.055 --> 05:49.140
At this rate, we'll be playing forever.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.120
All right!

06:44.028 --> 06:44.904
I did it!

06:44.987 --> 06:45.863
I won!

06:50.326 --> 06:53.204
It looks like I lost the second set.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.498
You are really talented!

06:56.749 --> 06:58.876
Okay, time for round three.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.211
Hmm…

07:00.962 --> 07:02.797
That was just exhausting.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.675
What say we have some tea, hmm?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.510
Tea?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.730
Forget about the tea.
Let's play the game.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.942
But teatime is tradition.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.319
It's proper croquet etiquette.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.656
Now, please, help yourselves.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.463
When this game is over,

07:44.380 --> 07:46.090
will we return to our world?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.136
You'll find out
at the end of the game.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.306
Don't talk to her, Arisu.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.392
Don't pay any attention to her.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
Remember.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.146
We just need to finish.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.149
Why do you want to know so badly?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.030
My best friends died.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.491
They never got to learn the truth.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.621
So I need to find out.
I'm doing it for their sake.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.625
-That's why I made it this far.
-You want to know.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.669
But you also want to return

08:23.753 --> 08:25.588
to your world.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.964
Can we return?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.093
Aww…

08:32.220 --> 08:34.430
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.935
For all you know,

08:39.560 --> 08:42.271
this could be the ruins
of your original world.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.815
See, you say that.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.568
But I bet you don't know anything either.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.946
Yes, I do.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.202
Hmm.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.455
I guess I have no choice.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.875
If you want to know so bad,

09:04.001 --> 09:05.670
then I'll tell you everything.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.048
The whole truth about where we are.

09:17.431 --> 09:21.477
However, when I start,
there's no going back.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.939
Remember that you had to know the answer.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.901
You asked for this, Arisu.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.702
Tell me, have you ever thought…

09:37.785 --> 09:40.288
pictured what the future would be like?

09:40.997 --> 09:42.748
-Future?
-Yes.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.502
Nanotechnology and renewable energy,

09:46.586 --> 09:51.048
pluripotent cells, virtual reality,
cryogenics, terraforming.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.720
The science and technology from your era

09:55.803 --> 09:58.931
bursts with mountains
of hope and potential.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.019
Perhaps you should be celebrating,

10:03.102 --> 10:06.105
because all of those things
became a reality.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.193
What's more, technology
rapidly advanced and progressed.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.740
Within 30 years, the economies
of developing countries grew,

10:15.823 --> 10:19.869
and the inequality of living standards
was eventually eliminated.

10:19.952 --> 10:24.707
Fifty years later, gene manipulation
extended the human lifespan.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.126
Wait a second.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.087
What are you saying?

10:32.798 --> 10:34.008
What are <i>you</i> saying?

10:35.343 --> 10:38.179
I am simply providing information.

10:40.097 --> 10:44.226
I'm telling you about
1,000 years of human history.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.605
A thousand years?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.857
In the future?

10:51.525 --> 10:54.820
After humanity
acquired more advanced knowledge,

10:54.904 --> 10:58.658
it persisted in making
new discoveries in every field.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.118
And so, in short,

11:01.202 --> 11:04.955
approximately ten years after
what you believe is the current year,

11:05.831 --> 11:08.084
virtual reality and avatars

11:08.167 --> 11:11.629
begin to take over
all aspects of people's lives.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.633
After 50 years, cures for dementia,
cancer, and many other maladies

11:15.716 --> 11:17.677
become possible through genetics.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.888
After a hundred,
natural disasters are eliminated

11:20.971 --> 11:23.766
thanks to environmental
and weather control technologies.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.561
After 200 years,
the mechanism of the brain is analyzed.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.272
Memories and thoughts can be transplanted.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.151
After 300, humanity
finally conquers natural death

11:34.235 --> 11:36.779
and extends their lifespan to 300 years.

11:36.862 --> 11:41.075
After 400,
due to a perfect understanding of physics,

11:41.158 --> 11:43.994
humanity unlocks all laws of causality.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.330
Coincidence and fate are no more.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.710
After 500,
there are no irregular occurrences.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.547
Humankind is perfectly able
to control its whole world,

11:54.630 --> 11:56.716
basically becoming immortal.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.012
In the 500 years that follow, as long
as they are supplied with dopamine,

12:02.096 --> 12:03.806
humans can live forever.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.058
That's the world in 1,000 years.

13:05.242 --> 13:09.497
<i>Right now, you are playing</i>
<i>this game within a virtual reality.</i>

13:10.539 --> 13:13.375
<i>You are so deeply immersed</i>
<i>that you've forgotten.</i>

13:15.544 --> 13:19.590
<i>This particular simulation is</i>
<i>the most popular virtual reality package</i>

13:19.673 --> 13:21.550
<i>a thousand years in the future.</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:26.514
<i>After more or less achieving eternal life,</i>
<i>people started losing their drive to live.</i>

13:26.597 --> 13:30.935
<i>And yet, we were enamored with</i>
<i>the period of time a thousand years ago.</i>

13:31.018 --> 13:34.230
<i>A time when people feared death</i>
<i>and the end of the world.</i>

13:34.313 --> 13:36.065
<i>It continued to fascinate us.</i>

13:40.277 --> 13:41.654
Oh, and…

13:41.737 --> 13:44.406
I'm the administrator of this system.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.041
I'm just joking.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.626
Not a word was true.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.878
Huh?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.714
Just quit fucking around.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.301
This is the truth.

14:06.387 --> 14:11.100
Genetically modified plants developed
sudden mutations and exploded with growth.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.019
I'm sure you must have noticed.

14:14.728 --> 14:15.771
The city?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.233
It's completely overrun with vegetation.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.111
What's more,

14:23.112 --> 14:25.364
the mountains surround us and close us in.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.123
All of that was the work of aliens.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.334
Aliens?

14:38.168 --> 14:41.422
They captured all of humanity
and wiped our memories.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.757
Forced us to play countless games.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.052
All so they could conduct
behavioral experiments on us.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.929
Is that…

14:49.722 --> 14:50.848
Is that true?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.435
Of course it is.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.770
Except

14:57.855 --> 15:00.399
a rumor started circulating
among the players.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.444
The ones forced to compete in the games.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.946
A rumor that that wasn't the whole story.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.741
A nuclear apocalypse
had wiped out most life,

15:08.824 --> 15:10.951
and the wealthy elite living underground

15:11.035 --> 15:14.038
had created androids
with artificial memories.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.374
These androids compete in games
on the surface,

15:17.458 --> 15:20.711
and the wealthy place bets
on who would survive.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.845
A real nail biter,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.432
Miss? Excuse me.

15:33.515 --> 15:36.477
-Can I place a bet?
-Yes, of course.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.730
The players believe
that they are humans,

15:39.813 --> 15:42.983
being forced by aliens
to play these games.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.361
But actually, they…

15:47.071 --> 15:48.238
and you

15:48.322 --> 15:50.908
are simply androids with a collection

15:51.617 --> 15:54.036
of artificial memories.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.164
So is that actually the truth?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.377
No! Just kidding.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.213
We need to finish one more set.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.882
Don't listen to what she's saying.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.177
You don't even know
the real answer, do you?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.682
You just might be right.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.062
Do you want the truth so badly?

16:22.481 --> 16:25.693
You want the truth
for the sake of your dead friends?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.326
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.830
It's written all over your face.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.251
They were tremendously important to you,
weren't they?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.216
You should know,

16:49.299 --> 16:52.469
I'm the one who made that game for you.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.974
I designed the Seven of Hearts
because you three were so close.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.894
Arisu!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.771
It's all right.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.481
Please don't stop him.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.817
Let him hate.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.987
Hate is the most incredible motivator.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.139
It's all part of your plan, isn't it?

17:43.479 --> 17:44.897
You want to get killed.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.608
I'm supposed to shoot you now.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.903
If I kill you in this game,

17:52.154 --> 17:53.489
we won't win.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.990
We won't clear it.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.825
There won't even be a game over.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.786
That means

17:59.661 --> 18:02.039
I would make this game go on forever.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.541
If that happens,

18:05.834 --> 18:09.338
all the other players are doomed
to wait until their visas expire.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.425
You want that.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.553
You want us to fall into despair.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.223
You want us to lose all hope.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.315
Tell me something.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.984
While you were playing the games,

18:32.069 --> 18:35.030
did you really care
about the rest of the world?

18:36.490 --> 18:40.202
Were you thinking about how
the world works or what its purpose is?

18:40.994 --> 18:42.371
Your own goals?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.082
Or did you lose interest? Huh?

18:45.874 --> 18:48.335
Did you start to accept
that it didn't matter?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.132
The answer doesn't matter.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.009
And I think you know that.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.556
Arisu. Don't listen to her.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.391
-I wanna know the answer.
-Arisu!

19:02.474 --> 19:03.892
Are you really sure?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.063
Yeah.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.322
It seems like you're prepared
to accept reality.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.621
So be it, then.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.501
I'll stop dodging your questions
and tell you what you want to know.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.714
Let's start with the big one.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.010
The world,
this world in front of your face,

19:38.594 --> 19:39.928
none of it is real.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.930
It's an illusion.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.146
You want me to believe
all of this is a trick?

19:49.730 --> 19:53.525
Arisu, were you never once suspicious
since you arrived?

19:54.151 --> 19:57.446
The desolate city,
and the science far too advanced?

19:57.529 --> 19:58.989
The mysterious games?

19:59.072 --> 20:00.616
Is it humans, or aliens?

20:00.699 --> 20:02.701
That doesn't make any sense, does it?

20:02.784 --> 20:06.580
Even if they were behind all this,
why would they choose to run these games?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.251
<i>Tag, hide-and-seek,</i>

20:11.835 --> 20:13.587
<i>they're children's games.</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:17.674
<i>Nothing beyond your imagination</i>
<i>is possible here.</i>

20:25.974 --> 20:28.435
It is no surprise that you were right.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.104
You were always meant
to survive this long.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.524
It's simple, really.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.987
This is all taking place in your mind.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.698
This is all in your head, you see.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.369
In a brain
that barely weighs 1,500 grams.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.971
Arisu.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.139
Don't listen to her.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.850
If this were an illusion,

21:09.559 --> 21:11.395
that means I'm not real.

21:11.478 --> 21:15.274
I can't just be something you invented!
Listen, I'm alive and I'm here!

21:15.357 --> 21:17.276
Of course you are.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.862
You exist, all right. Of course you do.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.532
But you're somewhere else.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.077
That is not the reality
Arisu is looking at right now.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.745
Huh?

21:30.664 --> 21:31.665
Arisu.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.752
What happened in that moment?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.380
You remember, don't you?

21:42.342 --> 21:43.760
When you lost them.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.889
Those friends
that were so precious to you.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.892
The shock of it

21:51.727 --> 21:53.562
wiped your memories.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.318
I'm your doctor.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.487
My name is Mira Kano.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.114
Remember me?

22:05.032 --> 22:06.325
Your psychiatrist.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.286
I'm helping you.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.997
We are doing therapy together.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.335
You just

22:17.794 --> 22:19.338
don't remember.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.300
You don't remember anything.

22:29.848 --> 22:30.891
So?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.603
What about now?

22:36.938 --> 22:38.273
Your memories…

22:40.567 --> 22:42.027
Are they coming back?

23:34.788 --> 23:36.706
Arisu, how are you?

23:39.668 --> 23:41.753
Tell me about your memories.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.296
Are they coming back to you?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.387
Chota.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.722
Karube.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.986
You're both two peas in a pod.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.156
She's always checking in.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.285
She really worries about you.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.542
She also lost
someone very precious to her.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.629
So she's been hospitalized here.
Just like you.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.095
Now,

24:32.971 --> 24:33.972
tell me.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.853
Tell me what happened to you, Arisu.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.357
On that day with the fireworks.

24:51.072 --> 24:51.990
Go on.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.618
Try to remember.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.957
Fireworks…

25:03.835 --> 25:05.587
-Whoa! Get off!
-Put me down.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.172
-Quick!
-You guys are crazy!

25:10.717 --> 25:12.511
Watch out! Watch out!

25:12.594 --> 25:14.346
-Hurry up! Come on!
-Aah! Uh, uh--

25:14.429 --> 25:15.597
Look! Fireworks!

25:15.680 --> 25:17.724
-Okay.
-Run for your lives!

25:21.895 --> 25:23.897
Huh? Huh? Huh?

25:24.731 --> 25:26.399
Huh? Huh…

25:53.343 --> 25:54.886
It was my fault.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.098
And now they're dead.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.726
It seems like you remember now.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.733
I'm the one who killed them.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.152
My fault…

26:12.904 --> 26:14.864
The answer you're trying to find,

26:16.199 --> 26:17.993
it's not about this world.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.537
Why it exists.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.624
The answer you're really searching for

26:26.459 --> 26:28.461
is what you are.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.257
You want to know why you're alive.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.427
Why you lived.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.346
You want to know why you exist.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.477
You grew up starved for love.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.815
You've been seeking that answer
a long time.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.028
Long before you came here.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.408
So what did you do?

26:59.993 --> 27:01.911
You manifested these games

27:02.621 --> 27:03.913
in your fantasies,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.125
these childlike games
you made for yourself.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.719
And as you kept surviving the games,

27:18.386 --> 27:19.638
you developed the desire

27:19.721 --> 27:22.307
to know the truth about this place.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.104
And that overlapped with your search
for meaning in your own life.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.107
They became intertwined in your head.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.030
Tell me, Arisu…

27:38.990 --> 27:40.867
in this whole world,

27:41.868 --> 27:43.620
is there anyone who needs you?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.875
I'm not sure I'm ready.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.128
Don't be silly.
You've prepared, haven't you?

27:52.212 --> 27:53.463
-I have, but I--
-Mm-hmm.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.049
I just…
I don't know how much…

27:57.676 --> 28:00.970
<i>Is there a reason</i>
<i>you exist in this world?</i>

28:01.054 --> 28:03.223
I've never had any concerns
about you, son.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.517
<i>Does your life have any meaning?</i>

28:19.656 --> 28:21.741
What's your life's purpose, son?

28:27.872 --> 28:30.417
How long are you going
to pass your days like this?

28:35.922 --> 28:36.798
Hey.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.969
Is there a reason you're alive?

28:44.389 --> 28:45.598
<i>And now</i>

28:46.474 --> 28:48.435
<i>you're the one who survived.</i>

28:55.775 --> 28:57.026
I don't know why.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.739
There's no reason for me to live.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.578
They're the ones

29:07.954 --> 29:09.664
who should have survived.

29:13.877 --> 29:14.878
Karube.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.714
Chota.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.052
Instead, it's me.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.640
I survived. The one with no reason to.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.484
I shouldn't be alive at all.

29:45.825 --> 29:46.910
Arisu.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.496
You need to wait outside for your turn.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.831
We'll be seeing you soon.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.835
-Arisu!
-Leave him alone.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.048
He is trying to remember everything
right now.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.968
Hey, hey! Wake up!

30:04.052 --> 30:05.720
-Hey!
-I said stop that!

30:08.681 --> 30:13.019
Arisu's remembering his past
so that he can recover.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.647
And you're interfering with that.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.566
-No!
-Step back.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.447
Now,

30:25.740 --> 30:26.866
Arisu…

30:30.245 --> 30:31.913
why don't we make this go away?

30:34.165 --> 30:37.293
All you need to do
is tell me that you're giving up…

30:40.129 --> 30:41.673
and the game will end.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.762
The game will… end.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.271
That means it's real.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.148
It wasn't an illusion.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.492
I was a player in that game too.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.015
Now,

31:32.932 --> 31:33.892
Arisu.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.731
Let me be absolutely certain.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.359
You're forfeiting?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.196
You're quitting the game, right?

32:09.636 --> 32:12.221
You'll feel better
after you take your medicine.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.142
Go on.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.193
After that,

32:26.736 --> 32:27.904
you can answer.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.758
Arisu, stop it.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.554
Arisu, no!

33:09.278 --> 33:10.822
I would put that down.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.538
Arisu…

33:23.042 --> 33:24.711
you promised.

33:26.045 --> 33:29.549
You promised you'd protect me,
no matter what.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.888
Don't listen to her.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.350
I am definitely here with you.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.979
I'm alive!

33:47.859 --> 33:50.319
But if you believe what she says…

33:54.907 --> 33:57.118
then our time together wasn't real.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.832
It was just something
you created in your mind.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.381
And if you made it all up, then…

34:14.260 --> 34:16.763
then that means I don't matter to you.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.099
And what I do shouldn't affect you.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.692
Arisu!

34:31.277 --> 34:32.528
Wake up.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.721
Arisu.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.523
Arisu.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.693
You have to come back.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.864
Please.

36:45.953 --> 36:48.706
What a truly touching display.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.083
However,

36:52.627 --> 36:55.838
the feeling you call love is powerless.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.054
Arisu.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.308
Please.

37:09.727 --> 37:10.853
I shouldn't be here.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.940
I shouldn't be alive.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.693
I have no reason to live.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.374
Come back…

37:34.585 --> 37:35.962
Arisu.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.517
The answer you're looking for…

37:51.310 --> 37:53.813
a reason to be alive…

37:58.359 --> 38:00.361
Forget all of it, Arisu.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.077
The-- the truth is

38:09.245 --> 38:11.163
everyone has a different answer.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.793
It doesn't matter now.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.213
You-- you don't need

38:20.172 --> 38:21.924
a-- a reason to live.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.473
This whole time
that we were looking for answers…

38:32.018 --> 38:34.270
…we've been searching side by side.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.446
That alone was all I needed.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.949
That was enough.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.753
You helped me realize what was important.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.884
It was you.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.348
It was you, Arisu.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.345
You poor thing.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.645
Looks like I've won.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.613
You'll be forfeiting now.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.117
Isn't that right, Arisu?

40:25.339 --> 40:27.425
And then…

40:29.051 --> 40:31.011
…our game will be over.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.934
Usagi.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.110
Usagi…

41:30.237 --> 41:32.156
I want to feel your hand.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.410
Just one more time.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.959
Walk side by side.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.754
One more time.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.137
And I want to eat next to you.

42:01.685 --> 42:02.978
Me too.

42:15.115 --> 42:16.200
Tomorrow…

42:21.914 --> 42:23.123
I just want…

42:25.042 --> 42:27.878
to say good morning to you.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.260
I want to laugh with you every single day.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.305
And some day…

42:41.892 --> 42:44.353
I want us to climb a mountain.

42:46.313 --> 42:47.773
Just being with you…

42:50.025 --> 42:52.528
that's more than enough, Usagi.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.782
We may fight.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.538
But some days, that might be nice.

43:07.459 --> 43:08.919
I want you to live.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.591
I want that.

43:31.942 --> 43:33.944
I want to keep protecting you.

43:53.797 --> 43:54.965
Game on.

43:57.718 --> 43:58.844
Last round.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.939
Arisu.

44:53.232 --> 44:54.400
It's okay now.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.747
Here, take it.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.261
How beautiful that was.

45:28.434 --> 45:29.935
I do mean that.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.360
Let's finish off the game.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.531
Let's both do it for her.

46:15.731 --> 46:16.774
Yes!

46:31.955 --> 46:32.998
Okay.

46:39.546 --> 46:41.006
Yes!

47:18.168 --> 47:19.545
Gah!

47:24.299 --> 47:26.134
Yes!

47:27.219 --> 47:29.137
Hmm! I win!

47:47.948 --> 47:49.116
Well done.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.661
You finished three sets.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.874
You didn't quit or forfeit the match.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.630
Congratulations, Arisu.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.635
<i>The game has ended.</i>

48:13.098 --> 48:14.141
Finally…

48:17.477 --> 48:18.729
Is it over?

48:26.445 --> 48:27.446
Yeah.

48:29.656 --> 48:31.074
We won, Usagi.

48:48.717 --> 48:49.593
Well?

48:51.094 --> 48:53.764
What is this place? Can you tell me now?

48:59.019 --> 49:00.020
Arisu.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.650
You'll find out soon enough.

49:10.739 --> 49:12.658
You will be given two choices.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.536
No matter which one you pick,

49:18.080 --> 49:19.581
you will learn the answer.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.920
And you'll learn who you really are
when you choose.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.382
You'll soon find out.

49:31.718 --> 49:33.095
Life is just…

49:34.763 --> 49:36.473
a game we play together.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.687
You should try to enjoy it.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.177
<i>Congratulations.</i>

50:14.803 --> 50:18.515
<i>All of the games have now been cleared.</i>

51:29.586 --> 51:34.341
<i>All surviving players</i>
<i>will be presented with two choices.</i>

51:35.884 --> 51:38.136
<i>Players must now all decide</i>

51:38.220 --> 51:41.890
<i>whether to accept</i>
<i>permanent residency in this country,</i>

51:41.973 --> 51:43.892
<i>or decline it.</i>

51:45.143 --> 51:46.353
<i>Once again,</i>

51:47.312 --> 51:52.025
<i>players must now decide</i>
<i>whether to accept permanent residency,</i>

51:52.109 --> 51:53.777
<i>or decline it.</i>

51:59.866 --> 52:01.076
I decline.

52:33.608 --> 52:34.651
And I…

52:36.194 --> 52:37.904
don't want it!

53:04.514 --> 53:05.849
I decline.

53:29.497 --> 53:31.291
Let's go back together.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.514
I accept, naturally.

53:47.807 --> 53:49.559
I will gladly take it as well.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.652
I want

54:00.237 --> 54:01.613
to turn it down,

54:02.197 --> 54:03.323
I think.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.620
What are you gonna say?

54:18.129 --> 54:19.839
I decline.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.123
I decline.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.211
I'm choosing not to stay here.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.717
Same for me.

55:07.971 --> 55:09.097
I don't want it.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.200
You want the usual?

55:31.953 --> 55:32.871
Sure, thanks.

55:34.456 --> 55:35.457
Here you go.

55:38.918 --> 55:39.753
Hey.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.256
What?

55:46.926 --> 55:48.511
One big-ass nose hair…

55:48.595 --> 55:49.971
Wait, what?

55:50.055 --> 55:50.930
Really?

55:51.639 --> 55:54.142
-No.
-Aw, you're such a piece of shit!

55:59.898 --> 56:01.816
Ah, you just looked so depressed.

56:02.859 --> 56:06.821
Listen, did you know you can
pull out your nose hair with wax?

56:06.905 --> 56:09.491
-That would hurt so bad!
-And they never grow back?

56:09.574 --> 56:11.076
Nah, they still grow back!

56:11.159 --> 56:13.244
-Then using a trimmer is way better.
-Oh, sure.

56:13.328 --> 56:15.997
What if something
falls on top of you while you're doing it?

56:16.081 --> 56:19.667
-That would hurt even worse.
-Well, not as badly as an explosion.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.087
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah!

56:27.300 --> 56:28.343
I'm sorry.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.304
I'm sorry.

56:33.348 --> 56:34.641
It's my fault.

56:36.434 --> 56:37.268
I'm sorry.

56:38.603 --> 56:40.355
Oh, his fault, he says.

56:41.231 --> 56:43.108
Someone thinks highly of himself.

56:43.191 --> 56:47.404
I bet you think you're alive because
you're, like, a chosen one or something.

56:47.487 --> 56:50.365
I don't! It's thanks to you guys.

56:50.448 --> 56:55.286
Come on. That makes it sound like we all
sacrificed ourselves to keep you alive.

56:55.370 --> 56:58.456
Chota, hey. Wasn't that a little harsh?

56:58.540 --> 57:00.792
Arisu's missing
the whole point, seriously.

57:02.836 --> 57:03.920
What the hell?

57:04.963 --> 57:06.464
What are you trying to say?

57:07.966 --> 57:09.509
Just tell me, come on.

57:12.762 --> 57:14.305
Listen, man, it's like this.

57:16.516 --> 57:19.602
Across all these games,
there hasn't been a single one,

57:19.686 --> 57:21.688
not one, that you cleared on your own.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.607
You could go on thanking us
for the rest of your life

57:24.691 --> 57:26.401
and it still wouldn't be enough.

57:27.318 --> 57:28.278
Okay…

57:29.571 --> 57:32.031
Should I apologize
for the rest of my life, then?

57:34.409 --> 57:35.326
Don't be an idiot.

57:36.202 --> 57:38.079
We want you to live your life, man.

57:38.913 --> 57:40.748
Live it to the fuckin' fullest.

57:46.296 --> 57:47.297
All right.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.091
Promise.

58:35.178 --> 58:37.764
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

58:37.847 --> 58:40.308
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies.

58:40.391 --> 58:42.644
Stop it with the zombie talk,
will ya?

58:42.727 --> 58:46.022
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

58:46.105 --> 58:48.566
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

58:49.150 --> 58:51.611
I doubt that.
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.488
Me? Why's that?

58:54.656 --> 58:55.990
'Cause I know you'd outsmart 'em.

58:59.661 --> 59:01.329
Shit. Let's do this.

59:01.412 --> 59:02.413
-Come on!
-Whoa--

59:02.497 --> 59:04.457
-Whoa!
-Whoa, what are you doing?

59:04.541 --> 59:07.001
You know, this is the first day
of your independence!

59:07.085 --> 59:09.170
-Coming through! Step aside!
-Whoa! Whoa!

59:09.254 --> 59:11.256
Gangway!

59:11.339 --> 59:13.341
Hey, slow down!

59:47.166 --> 59:49.210
Whoa! Whoa!

59:49.294 --> 59:50.962
Get down!

59:51.045 --> 59:52.630
-Quick!
-You guys are crazy!

59:55.550 --> 59:56.801
Okay, run! Run!

59:56.884 --> 59:58.803
-We can make it!
-Look, fireworks!

59:58.886 --> 59:59.929
-Run for your lives!
-Go!

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:02.432
Fuck, man!

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:04.392
Come on!

1:00:04.475 --> 1:00:06.436
Fuck, fuck! It's the police!
This is bad!

1:00:06.519 --> 1:00:08.438
-So bad! I'm sorry!
-Oh no… Run!

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:12.984
The stairs!

1:01:53.209 --> 1:01:55.628
Can you hear me? Sir!

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.505
-Can you hear me?
-I need a check here!

1:01:57.588 --> 1:01:59.048
-His vitals?
-Now!

1:01:59.132 --> 1:02:00.258
Copy that.

1:02:01.175 --> 1:02:02.260
We've got a pulse!

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:04.804
He's breathing!

1:02:05.847 --> 1:02:07.473
He's alive! We need a stretcher!

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:09.517
-Resume CPR.
-Okay.

1:02:10.143 --> 1:02:11.310
We need a gurney here!

1:02:11.394 --> 1:02:13.563
Now! Hurry!

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:50.850
<i>It has been two days since</i>
<i>a meteorite exploded over Tokyo…</i>

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:54.937
<i>Structural damage is</i>
<i>centered around a 10 km radius</i>

1:02:55.021 --> 1:02:56.731
<i>from Shibuya Park Street…</i>

1:02:58.149 --> 1:03:02.904
<i>…has extended its condolences</i>
<i>to the following families.</i>

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:05.865
<i>Some names are Kairi Nakamura,</i>

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:08.159
<i>Daikichi Karube…</i>

1:03:08.242 --> 1:03:09.702
<i>The government's set up…</i>

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:11.579
<i>…Kihiro Sato,</i>

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:13.790
<i>Chota Segawa,</i>

1:03:14.373 --> 1:03:16.209
<i>Kodai Tatta,</i>

1:03:16.292 --> 1:03:18.753
<i>Saori Shibuki…</i>

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:22.173
Karube and Chota are dead now.

1:03:24.383 --> 1:03:25.718
And I get to live?

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.013
Don't beat yourself up.

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:31.933
It'll only make it worse.

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:36.896
Survivor's guilt.

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:39.649
It's a hell of a thing to deal with.

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:43.903
"Why me? Why am I alive?"

1:03:45.112 --> 1:03:47.824
"Why couldn't they have been saved too?"
You know?

1:03:50.076 --> 1:03:52.870
Apparently, it happens
to most people after disasters.

1:03:53.746 --> 1:03:55.498
They end up blaming themselves.

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:01.629
But when they finally
found your body,

1:04:03.005 --> 1:04:04.799
your heart had completely stopped.

1:04:09.345 --> 1:04:10.763
A whole minute went by.

1:04:15.101 --> 1:04:18.479
Apparently, for a minute,
the borderlands had taken you.

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:22.358
A minute?

1:04:23.276 --> 1:04:24.193
Yeah.

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:32.869
A minute?

1:04:37.623 --> 1:04:38.666
You know…

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:42.211
it felt like…

1:04:44.297 --> 1:04:45.631
a lot longer.

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.636
Like I'd gone away for a long time.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:58.728
You know, uh…

1:05:00.021 --> 1:05:01.188
Dad cried.

1:05:03.357 --> 1:05:04.817
The last time he cried

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:07.862
must've been when Mom died.

1:05:43.230 --> 1:05:44.815
What do you want?

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:50.738
It looks to me like you must have
experienced a cardiac arrest.

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:54.784
What are you, a doctor?

1:05:57.912 --> 1:05:59.288
Well, I did too.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:03.668
What a coincidence.

1:06:07.129 --> 1:06:08.756
So we both almost died.

1:06:10.383 --> 1:06:11.884
You feel any different now?

1:06:14.637 --> 1:06:15.554
I don't know.

1:06:16.847 --> 1:06:19.225
I mean, I look a lot worse.

1:06:20.935 --> 1:06:21.894
What about you?

1:06:26.315 --> 1:06:28.859
I've been thinking a lot about my life.

1:06:30.277 --> 1:06:31.988
Choices I had to make.

1:06:32.738 --> 1:06:35.116
Pretty sure I'm gonna
be turning my life around.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:39.829
Or something like that.

1:06:42.790 --> 1:06:45.084
You were a piece of shit, too, huh?

1:06:45.167 --> 1:06:46.502
You fucked up?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:48.879
I did.

1:07:06.355 --> 1:07:09.942
Huh. After his cardiac arrest,
it's a miracle he's come this far already.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:12.570
-Could you get me some gauze, please?
-Yes, doctor.

1:07:19.910 --> 1:07:21.746
Is it someone you know?

1:07:21.829 --> 1:07:23.289
No. Not really.

1:07:28.461 --> 1:07:29.962
But I do understand.

1:07:31.005 --> 1:07:33.090
I bet he's trying to survive too.

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:35.426
He is.

1:07:56.113 --> 1:07:57.740
Commencing cardiac massage.

1:07:57.823 --> 1:07:59.116
Get the defib ready, now!

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:02.119
-Right away, doctor!
-Miss Ann, can you hear me?

1:08:02.203 --> 1:08:04.038
-Miss Ann!
-Clear!

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:06.290
Still no pulse!

1:08:06.373 --> 1:08:10.127
-Again! Charge it!
-Yes, sir! Charge complete!

1:08:10.211 --> 1:08:11.670
Clear!

1:08:13.089 --> 1:08:15.257
We have a pulse!

1:08:15.341 --> 1:08:18.385
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate is holding between 80 and 90.

1:08:18.469 --> 1:08:19.678
She's back!

1:08:19.762 --> 1:08:21.055
Resume operation!

1:08:21.138 --> 1:08:22.848
-Forceps.
-Here, doctor.

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:36.028
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1:08:36.529 --> 1:08:38.280
There's no need to rush at all.

1:08:38.364 --> 1:08:39.907
-You're doing very well.
-Okay.

1:09:28.164 --> 1:09:29.665
You came back to us.

1:09:51.270 --> 1:09:52.354
Hikari.

1:10:15.127 --> 1:10:18.797
…<i>has released two trillion yen</i>
<i>from the national treasury</i>

1:10:18.881 --> 1:10:20.216
<i>for emergency relief.</i>

1:10:21.050 --> 1:10:25.054
<i>A week has passed</i>
<i>since the meteorite exploded over Tokyo.</i>

1:10:25.137 --> 1:10:30.643
<i>Even now, all metro and railway operations</i>
<i>have been suspended in Tokyo,</i>

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:34.313
<i>and many major roads</i>
<i>have been shut down as well.</i>

1:11:11.892 --> 1:11:13.102
Sorry…

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:15.604
Do you mind if I use it?

1:11:16.188 --> 1:11:18.232
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1:11:45.718 --> 1:11:46.844
Hey, wait.

1:11:48.053 --> 1:11:49.054
Your change.

1:11:51.724 --> 1:11:52.558
Oh!

1:11:53.559 --> 1:11:54.685
Thanks a lot.

1:12:07.573 --> 1:12:08.490
Um…

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:11.285
Sorry, but have we met before?

1:12:13.662 --> 1:12:14.913
I don't think so.

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:20.502
Wait.

1:12:25.132 --> 1:12:27.301
Are you sure that I don't know you, miss?

1:12:28.552 --> 1:12:29.470
Uh…

1:12:33.682 --> 1:12:36.018
Are you, uh,

1:12:37.186 --> 1:12:38.520
flirting with me?

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:40.773
Uh, no.

1:12:40.856 --> 1:12:42.149
It's not like that.

1:12:44.568 --> 1:12:46.820
Uh, wait. Wait. Stop!

1:12:47.488 --> 1:12:48.364
Um, miss.

1:12:49.031 --> 1:12:51.283
Would it be all right if I was?

1:12:51.367 --> 1:12:52.534
Flirting with you?

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:02.836
I'm sorry.

1:13:03.796 --> 1:13:05.172
That wasn't cool of me.

1:13:10.177 --> 1:13:13.430
I think maybe we have met before.

1:13:15.974 --> 1:13:17.893
Uh, was it last year?

1:13:18.685 --> 1:13:20.145
Or was it…

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:22.439
When was that?

1:13:23.774 --> 1:13:25.818
I don't know.

1:13:27.111 --> 1:13:28.195
But we've met.

1:13:38.247 --> 1:13:40.916
Uh, the sun's out. It's pretty nice.

1:13:42.668 --> 1:13:46.213
Do you want to maybe step out?
Go for a walk?

1:13:47.506 --> 1:13:49.049
Mm. Mm-hmm!
