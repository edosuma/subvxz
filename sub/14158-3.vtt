00:20.767 --> 00:24.567
*
We're just trying to be
YouTube sensations, Sir.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.300
Jonah:
Mr. Joseph found out
about our YouTube channel

00:27.400 --> 00:28.534
of bullying videos...

00:28.634 --> 00:30.000
Joseph:
"Fobba-liscious
Bully Video 2."

00:30.100 --> 00:31.500
"Fobba-liscious
Bully Video with spew."

00:31.600 --> 00:33.734
The whole lot of you are gonna
end up in fucking juvie.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.500
...so we had to meet
the new school youth worker
for counseling...

00:36.600 --> 00:38.634
*
Kris:
Hey, boys,
come join in!

00:38.734 --> 00:40.334
See if you can pick it up.
Grab a spot at the back.

00:40.434 --> 00:41.834
...but he was a homo.

00:41.934 --> 00:43.334
Maybe just build
a relationship.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.300
A relationship?
We're not gay, sir.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.367
*
Yeah!
( shouting )

00:49.467 --> 00:52.034
Jonah:
Graydon and the rangas
made fun of my break dancing...

00:52.134 --> 00:54.034
It's fucking
embarrassing, man.
You're so bad.

00:54.134 --> 00:55.334
You can't dance
for shit.

00:55.434 --> 00:57.567
...so I had to get revenge.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.167
Joseph:
Have a look at him!
He's clearly a fuckwit.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.534
I'm clearly a fuckwit!

01:00.634 --> 01:02.600
Shut up, Fob!
At least I can read books.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.367
That's enough
of the racist thing, mate!
Jonah: Piss off, ranga.

01:05.467 --> 01:07.834
Jonah:
And when Graydon's little
brother picked on Moses...

01:07.934 --> 01:09.834
Hey, Pooses!
Fuck up, homo.

01:09.934 --> 01:12.434
...I tried to make the best
bullying video ever.

01:12.534 --> 01:14.234
This is called
"The Ranga Roundup

01:14.334 --> 01:15.667
with Year 7 homo
eating dog shit."

01:15.767 --> 01:18.667
Jonah!
You fucking idiot!
Fuck. Shit. Fuck.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.034
I'm calling your father!

01:20.134 --> 01:22.900
Sir, I love you!
I love you, Sir!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.767
( theme music playing )

01:38.367 --> 01:41.067
( clicking, thuds )

01:41.967 --> 01:44.067
( monkey chatters )

01:46.434 --> 01:48.967
* "Screems" from
da old plantation, non-stop... *

01:49.067 --> 01:51.367
( vocalizes music )

01:51.467 --> 01:54.500
* Screems from
da old plantation,
non-stop... *

01:54.600 --> 01:56.600
( vocalizes music )

01:56.700 --> 01:59.900
( over TV )
* We watch it all
just float away *

02:00.000 --> 02:01.900
* I see 'em all
coming my way *

02:02.000 --> 02:04.567
* And now they wanna
take my time *

02:04.667 --> 02:06.934
* I could tell 'em
what's on my mind... *

02:07.034 --> 02:09.200
( Jonah laughs )
Don't, faggot.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.234
It was an accident.
Dad!

02:11.334 --> 02:13.800
Don't fucking say anything
or I'll punch you in the vagina.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.700
Jonah:
'Cause of the ranga incident...
Dad!

02:15.800 --> 02:19.267
...Mr. Joseph told my dad
and I got grounded.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.800
Turn that shit down!

02:20.900 --> 02:22.767
* I live life like
there ain't no today... *

02:22.867 --> 02:24.667
How you turn this shit off?
Mary:
Dad, Jonah's been--

02:24.767 --> 02:26.600
Don't even say it.
Stop talking.
( TV shuts off )

02:26.700 --> 02:28.967
Moses, we gotta
get ready for bowling.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.667
You're not going anywhere.
You're grounded.

02:30.767 --> 02:33.034
Well, grounding's
for homos.

02:33.134 --> 02:35.100
You want a smack as well?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.834
No.
Do something useful
with your life!

02:37.934 --> 02:40.167
( softly )
Do something useful
with your face.

02:40.267 --> 02:43.267
My dad, he always
wants me to be a priest

02:43.367 --> 02:45.634
or a rugby player
or something good.

02:45.734 --> 02:48.867
That shit's for homos.

02:48.967 --> 02:50.434
( Jonah laughs )
What the fuck was that?

02:50.534 --> 02:52.400
Jonah:
Nothing. I didn't do it!
Jonah.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.534
( doorbell chimes )
Look, fuckhead, stop mucking
around with the wall!

02:55.634 --> 02:57.934
You want to sit on your ass
all day doing nothing?

02:58.034 --> 02:59.467
No, sir.
You're coming
to work with me.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.234
I'm not gonna go
to work with you!
I give you a uniform

03:01.334 --> 03:03.434
and you're coming
to work with me!
( door closes )

03:03.534 --> 03:05.500
I didn't-- I'm grounded!
You can't take me to work.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.034
Mr. Takalua.
You've got a dick job.

03:07.134 --> 03:08.667
Mary:
Hey, go home,
he's grounded.

03:08.767 --> 03:11.334
Rocky:
Hey, listen! Get ready
to go to work with me!

03:11.434 --> 03:14.167
Otherwise your ass
is gonna get red-hot
when I smacked it!

03:14.267 --> 03:15.800
( whispers )
Siana, are you coming or what?

03:15.900 --> 03:18.500
Your dad's mad as fuck.
Jonah:
He's always mad as fuck.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.267
Let's get ready, boys.
We're going bowling.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.567
* One for my ussos,
two for the liability *

03:23.667 --> 03:25.134
* Three to change
the world views *

03:25.234 --> 03:27.334
* There's little pools
hearing this *

03:27.434 --> 03:30.067
* Four's the producer
of tracks that ain't feeling it,
five is for the... *

03:30.167 --> 03:31.900
Come on!
( laughs )
Shit.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.267
* Yo Safari,
I see you! *

03:34.367 --> 03:36.067
* Some cats, they try to make
a brother feel short *

03:36.167 --> 03:38.834
* Oh yeah, we on safari,
catch my vile sickness,
señor... *

03:38.934 --> 03:40.934
Dox, there's Melody.
Hey, dox.

03:41.034 --> 03:43.667
Hey, Melody!
Melody, what are you doing?

03:43.767 --> 03:45.134
Hey.
What do you reckon?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.200
Ohhh!
Take it easy.
Wait for it.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.400
Hoo-hoo!
Oh yeah.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.167
Melody!
What?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.434
Come chill
with me over here.

03:56.534 --> 03:58.734
Sorry, girls,
I'm taking her away.

04:01.334 --> 04:03.234
Hey, you're losing.
Huh?

04:03.334 --> 04:05.967
You're losing.
You're not any better.

04:06.067 --> 04:08.467
You look hot.
Thanks.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.900
Have you eaten
much today?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.734
No. Why?

04:12.834 --> 04:15.667
It's--
the food's good here.

04:15.767 --> 04:17.134
Hot chips are good.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.567
Uh, I wanted
to ask you something.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.934
You know that assignment
we've got to do in Design?

04:23.034 --> 04:25.334
Yeah.
Well, would I be able
to papier-mâché you?

04:25.434 --> 04:26.667
What the fuck?
Like your body?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.134
Like put
papier-mâché on me?

04:28.234 --> 04:29.700
Why the fuck would
you wanna do that?
Yeah.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.400
It's a sculpture thing.
Miss said we could do them.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.467
I was gonna papier-mâché
my dick, but Miss said no.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.834
Uhm, whatever.

04:37.934 --> 04:39.367
But I should
get back to the game.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.267
Okay.
Thanks for talking to me.

04:41.367 --> 04:44.034
You do realize
we're cousins.

04:44.134 --> 04:45.600
Yeah, I know.
I don't care.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.900
But, hey, before you go,
I wanna tell you a joke,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.067
a bowling joke.
No.

04:50.167 --> 04:54.300
What did the bowling alley
do to my dick?

04:54.400 --> 04:57.800
Give me balls.
You're so lame.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.000
It's a joke.
I made it up.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.934
See you, Melody!

05:02.034 --> 05:05.167
Hey, Moses,
ask if you can touch it.

05:05.267 --> 05:06.867
Miss, can he touch
the ball?

05:06.967 --> 05:09.900
Jonah:
Moses is obsessed
with the golden bowling ball.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.934
You're touching
$10,000, Moses.

05:12.034 --> 05:14.134
( chuckles )
Jonah:
It's this bowling ball, right,

05:14.234 --> 05:16.200
and they keep it on the shelf
behind the counter

05:16.300 --> 05:18.234
and it's worth $10,000.
As if.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.467
'Cause it's made
of pure solid gold.

05:20.567 --> 05:21.767
Bull!
It is!

05:21.867 --> 05:23.100
No, it ain't.
Ask the manager.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.667
We asked last time
we were here.
It is.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.267
Go ask the lady
behind the counter.
You don't even know.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.067
Oh, you can feel
how expensive it is.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.567
If it was worth that much,

05:30.667 --> 05:32.734
they wouldn't have it
on the shelf like that.
Yeah.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.267
They would have alarms and shit.
That's why
they've got security.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.300
Security guys.
Look, there's one over there.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.000
Manu: Security is too chubby!
Jerome:
Oh shit, your dad, siana.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.667
Holy fuck!
Boys, go go.

05:39.767 --> 05:42.334
Jonah, I'm gonna
smack your asshole!
Boys, boys.

05:42.434 --> 05:43.834
Boys,
come here, come here.

05:43.934 --> 05:46.200
Come over here,
you little fuckwit!

05:46.300 --> 05:48.334
Go down here.
Go down here.
If you don't come over here,

05:48.434 --> 05:50.500
I'm gonna kill
the shit out of ya!

05:50.600 --> 05:53.534
Come over here right now!
You can't go--

05:53.634 --> 05:55.167
Come and get us, Dad!
Come and get us!

05:55.267 --> 05:56.267
Oh yeah?
All right then!

05:56.367 --> 05:58.167
Get away!
Get away!

05:58.267 --> 06:00.567
Come over here!

06:00.667 --> 06:02.234
( laughter )

06:02.334 --> 06:03.867
You're dead,
motherfucker!

06:03.967 --> 06:06.734
Dad! Dad!

06:07.900 --> 06:09.800
( shouting )
Just get out of--

06:09.900 --> 06:11.234
You can't do that here.

06:11.334 --> 06:13.834
Get-- Jesus!
Get off of me!
Stop breaking the rules!

06:13.934 --> 06:16.400
I'm gonna break your dick
when we get home!
*

06:16.500 --> 06:18.067
Oh yeah, if you do,
you're a homo!

06:18.167 --> 06:19.567
Always thought
you were one!

06:19.667 --> 06:21.667
*

06:27.300 --> 06:29.600
Hunt:
Okay, please put
your smocks away,

06:29.700 --> 06:31.867
then please tuck
your chairs in, guys.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.334
( boys chattering )

06:33.434 --> 06:37.034
Keep ripping.
Smaller strips.

06:37.134 --> 06:38.634
How long is this
gonna take to dry?

06:38.734 --> 06:40.467
It dries really quickly.
I'm gonna use a hair dryer.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.234
I've just gotta
do more on this area.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.334
Stop trying
to touch my boobs!
You sicko!

06:44.434 --> 06:46.667
I'm not!
I've just go to--
You've been doing it a lot.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.800
The surface needs
more work there.
Just stop.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.600
Oh my goodness.
I can't help it.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.934
I gotta do this--
just one--
Jonah, stop!

06:53.034 --> 06:54.600
I just gotta make it good!

06:54.700 --> 06:55.967
Siana, that looks good as.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.467
You look hot
in newspaper, Melody.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.967
Hey, Jonah,
do you need help?
No!

06:59.067 --> 07:00.567
Don't fucking touch.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.167
Melody:
Yeah, fuck off.
She's my cousin!

07:02.267 --> 07:04.567
Only Jonah can touch me.
Yeah, only I can touch her.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.734
Manu:
All right then.
We're relations.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.534
I'm the artist
in this situation.

07:09.634 --> 07:11.634
And stop trying
to touch my boobs.
I'm not.

07:11.734 --> 07:13.300
I'm just doing this bit.
You're still touching it.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
I'm not even touching it.
I'm doing the middle bit.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.367
Where's that snorkel?
Put this in your mouth.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.900
Do I have to? Really?
Yeah, 'cause I've gotta
do your face.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.734
I'm doing the whole thing,
feet to face.
( speaks indiscernibly )

07:24.834 --> 07:26.134
Jonah: Okay.

07:26.234 --> 07:29.867
Manu: Oh, look. Oh.
Siana, that look like cum.

07:29.967 --> 07:33.534
Oh. Oh!
That's what Jonah wants to
splatter on her face for real.

07:33.634 --> 07:35.434
( laughter )
Oh my God.
Jonah: Leave me be!

07:35.534 --> 07:37.600
Come on, come on,
pack up please.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.467
It's good art, isn't it, Miss?
Yes, it's a fantastic
sculptural form.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.967
I want you to think
about your process diary

07:43.067 --> 07:44.834
and your design brief.
Yeah, I know about it.

07:44.934 --> 07:46.034
It's about my culture.
Yeah?

07:46.134 --> 07:47.700
It's about Tongan
girl shapes

07:47.800 --> 07:49.200
and what they mean to me.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.300
Okay, I'm gonna need
more of an explanation
than that.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
You need a hug, Miss.
Give me a hug.
No. No no no no no no no.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.700
No no no no.
No, Jonah. No, get off.
Just give me a hug.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.267
That's all you need.
Jonah! Get off, Jonah.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.367
Pack up, please.
Thanks, Miss.

07:59.467 --> 08:00.634
Pack up.
Okay, girls,

08:00.734 --> 08:03.067
plug this in and dry it.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.500
And when you're
finished drying,
just lift it off,

08:05.600 --> 08:07.534
put it on the table,
put my name on it.

08:07.634 --> 08:10.100
Here, I'll leave this with you.
Sonny:
Hey, what's up, Mr. Joseph?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.500
Mr. Joseph!
S'up, Sir?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.234
Jesus Christ.
How'd you wangle this?

08:15.334 --> 08:17.367
It's good art, Sir.
You don't know shit
about art.

08:17.467 --> 08:18.767
Yeah, Sir,
you don't know shit.
It's a sculpture.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.334
What are you in Design for?
It's papier-mâché.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.867
I'm here to escort
you little pricks

08:21.967 --> 08:24.600
over to your first counseling
session with Mr. Fonua.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.267
I figured you'd forget.
Manu:
Mister who?

08:26.367 --> 08:28.567
We know where to go, Sir.
You don't need to take us.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.034
Yeah, Sir.
We don't want
to hang out with Kool Kris.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.000
Yeah? Well, Listen,
it was all part of the deal.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.100
You're a bunch of bullies.
You need to learn the error
of your ways.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.867
Let's go.
Sir, don't take us there.

08:35.967 --> 08:38.167
I know where his room is.
Promise?

08:38.267 --> 08:39.934
Yeah, trust us for once.
Yeah, Sir.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.100
Don't fuck me around.
You go straight there,
you hear me?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.334
We won't!
Straight there!

08:43.434 --> 08:45.267
Straight there.
Definitely, Sir.
Go!

08:45.367 --> 08:46.767
Promise, Sir!
See you, Sir!

08:46.867 --> 08:48.967
Joseph:
Straight there!
( hair dryer whirring )

08:49.067 --> 08:51.334
*

08:56.367 --> 08:58.334
Moses! Moses, quick.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.467
We gotta hide from Kool Kris.
He wants to counsel us.
Manu: Yeah.

09:00.567 --> 09:01.467
When he comes,
we can duck quickly.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.034
All right,
all right, hurry up.

09:03.134 --> 09:04.400
Over there, hurry.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.334
Down, boys.
Get down.

09:09.434 --> 09:11.334
Oi, fellas!
( Moses giggles )

09:11.434 --> 09:13.434
He's coming.
Kris:
Come over.
Let's get started.

09:13.534 --> 09:14.800
Let's go, boys!
( laughter )

09:14.900 --> 09:17.334
*

09:18.767 --> 09:22.134
( chattering )
Get under--
get under the tables.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.700
Get under.
( laughter )

09:27.234 --> 09:30.400
Manu:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Shh! Shut up!

09:30.500 --> 09:32.334
What are you boys doing?
Sonny: Oh shit.

09:32.434 --> 09:34.400
Nothing, Miss.
What are you doing?

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
Mr. Fonua is looking for you.
I've just walked past him.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.667
Apparently you've
an appointment.
Jonah:
Yeah, we were going there.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.400
Manu: We were going there, Miss.
You've got an appointment.
Off you go.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.167
Yeah, we're going.
We're on our way there.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.734
We're just stopping out there.
Hunt: Go on.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.834
Sonny:
We were just
checking out the table.
Okay.

09:45.934 --> 09:47.167
Manu:
Love you, Miss.

09:47.267 --> 09:48.800
( whispering )

09:48.900 --> 09:50.234
We're gonna need
to split up,

09:50.334 --> 09:51.967
go in separate directions
if we're gonna lose him.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.267
Manu: Yeah?
Sonny: Let's do it.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.234
All right, go go.
Split up, boys. Let's go.

09:55.334 --> 09:58.267
*
Different directions, boys!

10:08.234 --> 10:10.467
Sister, I feel sick.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.300
I've got like stomach pains
or some shit.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.534
Oh, you poor thing.
Come on through.

10:16.034 --> 10:17.467
We're going to sick bay?

10:19.634 --> 10:21.400
Well, maybe you need
a glass of water, yeah?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.300
Yeah, I might have
to lie down too.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.634
You do feel like
you have a temperature,

10:25.734 --> 10:28.400
so a little rest'll help,
make you feel better.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.267
Mmm.
Have you still got
the tummy pains?

10:30.367 --> 10:32.434
Yeah, I think I might have
food poisoning, sister.

10:32.534 --> 10:35.200
Umm, and my head hurts too.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.800
Oh. Well, rubbing the head
a little bit sometimes helps

10:37.900 --> 10:39.100
when it's sore.
Mmm.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.967
Umm, my dick hurts too.

10:42.067 --> 10:45.534
What?!
Nothing. I'm just--
I'm only joking.

10:45.634 --> 10:48.000
Do you feel like
you might throw up?
No.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.067
Oh, actually,
yeah, I might.

10:50.167 --> 10:53.600
Well, I'm gonna leave you
to rest for a while, okay?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.300
Okay.
Now I'm only going
to be over there,

10:55.400 --> 10:56.934
so call me if you need me.

10:57.034 --> 10:58.400
I don't want
you to go, but--

10:58.500 --> 11:00.000
you stay,
'cause I'll be bored.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.600
Well, I've got work to do.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.400
I want to tell you some jokes.
Sister, sit down.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.134
Sit down.
I want to tell you some jokes.

11:05.234 --> 11:08.034
Just a couple of jokes.
Just-- come on.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.967
You like my jokes and shit.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.300
No, but no swearing.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.967
No.
Okay, first joke.

11:13.067 --> 11:16.334
Um, what did the school say

11:16.434 --> 11:18.000
when the teachers didn't come?

11:18.100 --> 11:20.434
"You're sacked,
so get lost."

11:20.534 --> 11:22.700
( clicks tongue )
Oh, that's silly.
It's not a swear word.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.900
Umm...

11:25.000 --> 11:26.900
what did the nun say
to the priest?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.500
"Shut up."

11:28.600 --> 11:32.534
( laughter )
Don't know why,
but I like that one.

11:32.634 --> 11:35.000
What did the old lady
say to her face?

11:35.100 --> 11:37.100
"Shut your face,
nun head."

11:37.200 --> 11:39.234
Oh, I don't like that one.
( laughs )

11:39.334 --> 11:41.734
I'm just being silly.
I wasn't being mean, Sister.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.334
Sister, can I do
some rapping?

11:44.434 --> 11:47.234
Like freestyle rapping?
Well, all right,

11:47.334 --> 11:49.200
but if that phone rings,
I've gotta get it.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.467
Can you beatbox? No.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.567
Um, okay.
It's about Holy Cross.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.200
* I like Holy Cross,
the teachers get cross *

11:59.300 --> 12:03.067
* Cross the road,
Jesus on the cross *

12:03.167 --> 12:05.967
* You are a nun,
you look quite good *

12:06.067 --> 12:07.667
* In your hood...
( laughs )

12:07.767 --> 12:11.267
* How many nuns do you meet
in your life? Probably none. *

12:11.367 --> 12:13.734
Get it? "Probably none."
( laughs )
I like the nun bit, yeah.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.034
Same as "nun."
( knocks )
I do like the nun bit.

12:16.134 --> 12:19.200
Boys.
Sister, we feel
a bit sick.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.267
Yeah.
What, all of you?

12:21.367 --> 12:23.167
Yeah.
Did you all eat
the same thing?

12:23.267 --> 12:26.434
Yeah, I think it's
the flu or something.
Oh my goodness.

12:26.534 --> 12:28.167
Sister thinks we might have
food poisoning, boys...

12:28.267 --> 12:30.000
Boys: Yeah.
...from the tuck shop.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.934
Sonny: I think we do.
I haven't got enough beds
for all of you,

12:32.034 --> 12:34.767
so you better just hop
onto Jonah's bed

12:34.867 --> 12:37.567
and have a rest.
Hop on, boys!
We'll share it up.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.167
Thanks, Sister!
Thanks, Sister.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.134
Thanks for looking after us.
All right now.

12:41.234 --> 12:42.734
We'll just chill here.
We'll let you know

12:42.834 --> 12:45.367
if anything bad happens,
any medical emergencies.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.400
I'll come back
and check on you later.
We'll ring the bell.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.534
Hopefully we don't
have heart attacks.
We'll do four steps.

12:49.634 --> 12:51.467
Boys:
* I'm your island boy...
Fuck, she fell for it.

12:51.567 --> 12:56.234
* You're my island girl,
let's be together forever *

12:56.334 --> 13:00.700
* I'm your island boy,
I kill a horse for you *

13:00.800 --> 13:02.434
* And we can eat it together

13:02.534 --> 13:06.600
* Yeah yeah,
hey, island girl,
the skux is here... *

13:06.700 --> 13:10.267
Israel: What?
* I want to suck on your tits,
so come here... *

13:10.367 --> 13:11.967
Yeah.
* Take off
your island skirt *

13:12.067 --> 13:14.334
* I promise it won't hurt.
Yeah.

13:14.434 --> 13:17.300
Kris:
Ah, here we are, boys.
Oh, we're sick as, Sir.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.634
Oh, you don't sound
sick to me.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.434
I just heard some cool
rapping and singing.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.434
We've got food poisoning
from the tuck shop!
Yeah.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.100
Kris:
All right, look,
you win this time.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.434
Lunchtime's over,
all right?

13:25.534 --> 13:27.534
But Mr. Joseph told me
you've got detention

13:27.634 --> 13:29.567
this afternoon
at the horticultural center,
all right?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.567
So we're going to meet
for counseling, all right?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.834
Don't be afraid, guys.
I don't bite.
We don't have detention.

13:33.934 --> 13:35.967
Fuck, no way.
I'm not afraid.
We just don't want to do it.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.534
Yeah.
No, Sir.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.267
Get up
and go to class now.
Manu: You go to class.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.867
Fuck shit.
( moans )

13:40.967 --> 13:42.234
Fuck.
Sir, why do you have to be--

13:42.334 --> 13:43.400
You're a dickhead.
Kris: Come on.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.534
Flippin' hell.
Stop bullying us.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.067
Asshole.

13:47.167 --> 13:48.800
Hey, Sister!
Bye, Sister.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.967
We're feeling better.
Thanks, Sister!
Thanks, Sister.

13:51.067 --> 13:54.700
( laughs )
They're hopeless.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.534
( chatter, laughter )
*

14:00.067 --> 14:02.234
( chattering )

14:06.734 --> 14:08.800
What is this shit, anyway?
Someone already dug here.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.167
You have to
plant it on the thing.
Don't take it out.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.067
This is pretty fun, boys.
Look, see?

14:13.167 --> 14:14.634
It's boring
and not fun at all.

14:14.734 --> 14:17.234
Dox, you stuffed it up.
You put too much dirt.
Like this?

14:17.334 --> 14:18.600
Hey! ( grunts )
Fuck up!

14:18.700 --> 14:20.100
Stop messing with my work.
Don't hit my ass.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.700
It still hurts
from the weekend.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.067
Did Dad give you
a hiding, Jonah?
Tongan dads, eh? Oof.

14:25.167 --> 14:26.667
Manu:
Yeah. Show you.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.500
Hey, garden's
looking good, boys.
Keep going.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.867
I was thinking
maybe we could have
a chat at the same time.

14:30.967 --> 14:33.100
Don't wanna chat.
Kris: Hey, listen,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.234
today's more about
just airing any issues

14:35.334 --> 14:37.467
you might be having
with the school or at home.

14:37.567 --> 14:38.934
You won't get
in trouble for anything

14:39.034 --> 14:40.700
you might want to say,
so just feel free.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.067
It's more of a general
get-to-know-you session.

14:43.167 --> 14:44.434
Get to know
my dick, Sir.

14:44.534 --> 14:46.034
That sounds
gay as, siana.
( laughter )

14:46.134 --> 14:48.000
Fuck up.
Gay joke.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.334
Sir, no one cares
what you have to say,

14:50.434 --> 14:52.900
so enjoy
talking to yourself,
Krissy Church-head.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.634
Look, man, I've been
through some pretty shit times
myself, all right?

14:55.734 --> 14:58.034
I'm hell tough.
You guys can say
whatever you want to say,

14:58.134 --> 14:59.334
call me whatever
you wanna call me.

14:59.434 --> 15:00.667
It's like water
off a duck's back.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.600
Okay, you're a Christian
homo dickhead

15:02.700 --> 15:05.967
and a shit dancer.
( boys laughing )

15:06.067 --> 15:07.334
You said say anything.
See, I don't even care.

15:07.434 --> 15:09.034
I was saying that kind
of stuff to teachers

15:09.134 --> 15:10.734
when I was your age as well.
( boys mutter )

15:10.834 --> 15:12.300
You're a dickhead.
( humphs )

15:12.400 --> 15:14.467
Well, hey, listen,
what about Mr. Joseph?

15:14.567 --> 15:15.834
All right?
What do you guys
think about him?

15:15.934 --> 15:17.367
He's a knob-head.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.300
No, fuck up.
He's a legend.
No, he's not.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.367
He killed people in the army.
Manu: No, he didn't, you liar.

15:21.467 --> 15:23.300
He did. He told me.
You're lying.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.434
Hey, have you guys thought
about your future at all?

15:25.534 --> 15:27.134
Any areas of work
you wanna get into?

15:27.234 --> 15:29.267
I want to go to uni.
Kris: Yeah?

15:29.367 --> 15:31.634
Jonah, you?
Go to uni, but--

15:31.734 --> 15:33.234
Well, uni's pretty hard
to get into.

15:33.334 --> 15:34.834
I'd love it
if you got in.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.800
We shouldn't rule it out.
What about the trades, guys?

15:36.900 --> 15:40.267
Any of the vocational
trade training subjects
interest youse?

15:40.367 --> 15:41.834
Metalwork's pretty good.
Yeah?

15:41.934 --> 15:43.900
Yeah.
I like papier-mâché.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.100
Well, that's good.
That's art.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.734
Maybe you could be
an artist.

15:46.834 --> 15:48.400
No, I'm a shit drawer.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.567
Anyone else?

15:52.267 --> 15:55.267
Guys, I wanna talk
about bullying,
all right?

15:55.367 --> 15:57.600
You guys have been
in trouble for bullying.
Why do you do it?

15:57.700 --> 15:59.334
( scoffs )
'Cause we dominate
the school.

15:59.434 --> 16:01.200
Yeah, we're the toughest
in the whole school,

16:01.300 --> 16:02.900
so we have to remind people
not to mess with us.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.467
I don't think
you do dominate,

16:04.567 --> 16:07.234
and I think you guys
know it deep down inside.
We do.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.800
So you guys try
and pick on small kids

16:09.900 --> 16:11.734
just to make yourself
feel better, am I right?

16:11.834 --> 16:14.200
No.
No.
I'm a Fob too, boys.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.067
I remember what
it was like in high school.

16:16.167 --> 16:17.367
Yeah, but you would've
been a nerd Fob.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.900
Yeah.
We're way tougher
than you.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.034
I was saying that
to teachers when I was
your age as well.

16:21.134 --> 16:22.667
I thought
all my teachers were nerds.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.234
No, you really are one, sir.
( laughing )

16:24.334 --> 16:26.434
Sorry to tell you.

16:26.534 --> 16:29.034
Hey, Mr. Joseph tells me
you've been in trouble
with the law as well.

16:29.134 --> 16:31.634
Is that right?
Ages ago,

16:31.734 --> 16:33.167
but I'm good now.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.100
Mm-hmm. Shoplifting,
tagging and stuff?

16:35.200 --> 16:38.700
Yeah, Jonah did
the shoplifting to show off
in front of The Soldierz.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.367
Who are The Soldierz?
Just these gun-as boys.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.667
They're older than us.
Fob boys.
Yeah.

16:43.767 --> 16:46.767
They're rich as.
What, and they encourage you
to shoplift?

16:46.867 --> 16:48.367
Yeah.
They don't sound
like good guys to me.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.500
No, they are.
They're legendary.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.400
All right.
Well, what about
your dancing, guys?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.867
You guys are incredible.
Why don't you pursue that?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.400
Sir, we're shit.
We're shit as.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.567
Yeah.
You saw the dance demo
the other day.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.200
We suck.
There's no way we'd ever be
as good as those boys.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.134
Yeah, but that's
because you don't practice.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.700
Listen, I guarantee you
if you guys worked
at it,

17:06.800 --> 17:09.434
you'll surprise yourselves.
I've seen you in the
playing ground.

17:09.534 --> 17:12.367
You guys are incredible,
and your singing is awesome.

17:12.467 --> 17:15.100
Moses, the tone
in your voice,
man, is beautiful.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.700
I really--
I mean that.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.334
I'm taking him to America
to get a record deal.

17:19.434 --> 17:22.167
Just gotta get $5,000 first.

17:22.267 --> 17:25.267
Yeah, they going Qantas,
business class.
Yeah.

17:25.367 --> 17:26.967
Gonna get upgraded...
Going economy.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.734
No, first class.
...to first class.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.467
It's better.
First class is better.
Listen, "Feel The Beat."

17:31.567 --> 17:34.000
Sir, that looks gay as.
Well, it's not, okay?

17:34.100 --> 17:37.134
Entries close soon.
You guys gotta sing and dance
and do whatever.

17:37.234 --> 17:38.400
All right?
We're not doing it.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.400
Why not?
'Cause we don't want to.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.167
Guys, listen, the prize--
if you make it through
to the heats,

17:44.267 --> 17:46.900
and then the state finals
and make it to the nationals,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.967
the prize is
a trip to America

17:49.067 --> 17:50.867
to work with industry
professionals

17:50.967 --> 17:53.567
and to make
contacts with people
in the entertainment industry.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.534
That's good for you.
How do we win it?

17:56.634 --> 17:58.900
Well, you've got to make
a video clip entry, right?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.567
It's got to be
an original performance
with an anti-bullying theme.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.600
All right?
If they like your clip,
you make it to the heats,

18:05.700 --> 18:07.567
and if you go
through in that,
you can make it

18:07.667 --> 18:10.667
to the state
finals at the Sydney
Entertainment Center, see?

18:10.767 --> 18:13.267
Well, we don't know how
to do a video clip, Sir.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.067
I do.
What do we have to do,

18:15.167 --> 18:16.300
like a song
or some shit?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.734
Okay, well,
this is what I suggest--

18:17.834 --> 18:20.267
you guys work with me
every afternoon this week,

18:20.367 --> 18:22.067
and we work
on the song together.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.667
We make a video clip
and we send it in,

18:23.767 --> 18:26.867
see what happens.
Guys, this is an
awesome opportunity.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.200
What do you reckon, siana?

18:28.300 --> 18:29.400
Jonah and Moses:
Suppose.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.900
Manu:
I reckon we should do it.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.800
Kris: All right,
strum me something.
Just strum anything.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.067
Manu:
Anything? Anything?

18:34.167 --> 18:35.700
Kris:
Yeah. Yeah.
Manu: So money.

18:37.167 --> 18:40.734
* Ooh, I feel so alone...

18:40.834 --> 18:42.534
( laughter )

18:42.634 --> 18:44.567
Sir, that is the gayest thing
you've ever done!

18:44.667 --> 18:47.434
Krissy, don't ever
sing again, okay?
What?

18:47.534 --> 18:48.900
Don't ever sing, cuz.
Listen listen listen.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.134
Listen, this song has
to have an anti-bullying
message.

18:52.234 --> 18:54.267
Fuck, that was funny.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.467
Listen, I'm thinking maybe
if Moses sings the hook,

18:57.567 --> 18:59.967
all right? This is
all part of it, guys.

19:00.067 --> 19:02.734
We have to encourage
each other and learn how
to just build each other up.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.300
Don't try and--
It's gotta sound
gangster though.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.900
Yeah. Sir, mean as.
I'm not doing that gay stuff.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.400
Yeah, I don't wanna
do a gay song.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.234
All right, then what ab--
okay, then I'll do a beatbox

19:09.334 --> 19:11.234
and then you guys freestyle.
Yeah, drop us some beat.

19:11.334 --> 19:12.400
Yeah, drop us
some beatboxing.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.600
Hit us with our beat,
Krissy.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.167
Okay.
( beatboxing )

19:15.267 --> 19:18.034
Yo, G.
Ooh, Krissy...

19:18.134 --> 19:20.767
Yo.
Don't be a bully!

19:20.867 --> 19:23.034
What a gay voice he's got.
( laughter )
Fuck off!

19:23.134 --> 19:25.000
It's good,
it's good, it's good.
Keep going.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.667
I'm doing--
I'm trying my best.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.100
Yeah, that's it.
That's the point.
That's the point.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.734
Ready?
( beatboxing )
Yo yo yo.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.500
* Don't be a bully,
"moolly, moolly"... *

19:33.600 --> 19:35.300
Stop it.
Don't say "mooli"!
That's ass!

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
I don't care!
It doesn't matter.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.634
Siana, it sounds good
anyways, man.

19:38.734 --> 19:39.700
Again.
( beatboxing )

19:39.800 --> 19:41.300
Yo! Yeah.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.534
* I want to beat the shit
out of every motherfucker... *

19:43.634 --> 19:45.534
Whoa whoa whoa!
Hey, we're against
bullying, remember?

19:45.634 --> 19:48.234
What's wrong, Sir?
Boys:
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.400
I'm getting
the bully beat. Go.
*

19:50.500 --> 19:52.934
Manu: * Bully
Jonah: * Fobba-liscious!
Listen to us *

19:53.034 --> 19:55.400
Moses:
* I feel sad,
I feel pain *

19:55.500 --> 19:58.534
* When you call me
that name *

19:58.634 --> 20:02.900
* I'm a person
just like you *

20:03.000 --> 20:04.834
* Don't be a bully

20:04.934 --> 20:07.434
* Hey, bullies
* Listen up

20:07.534 --> 20:10.034
* Stop walking around
* Thinking you're so tough

20:10.134 --> 20:11.400
( grunts )
* Just 'cause a kid's got

20:11.500 --> 20:13.467
* A different color hair

20:13.567 --> 20:15.767
* Don't mean
you can be a bully *
* Yeah yeah yeah

20:15.867 --> 20:18.567
* You're gonna get busted
* For calling kids names

20:18.667 --> 20:21.734
* The teachers get a note
* He'll write down
all your names *

20:21.834 --> 20:23.634
* So don't be a bully

20:23.734 --> 20:24.967
* Bully, bully!

20:25.067 --> 20:27.167
* Fobba-liscious,

just like you *

20:48.300 --> 20:49.800
* Don't be a bully

20:49.900 --> 20:52.900
* If a kid's being a pussy,
just try to be nice *

20:53.000 --> 20:56.067
* Don't punch him in the head,
just try to socialize *

20:56.167 --> 20:59.067
* Hi, what's up?
We're Fobba-liscious *

20:59.167 --> 21:01.034
* What do you wanna do

21:01.134 --> 21:04.834

21:22.534 --> 21:24.834
We're gonna win it.
We're gonna win!

21:24.934 --> 21:26.900
( chattering )
Hey hey, I'm gonna

21:27.000 --> 21:28.167
This is awesome.
Yes!
Yeah, man.

Uh-huh.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.734
Don't do the homework!

21:48.834 --> 21:51.267
Boys, don't do the homework,
'cause I'm not doing it!

21:51.367 --> 21:55.534
Yeah, school's so shit.
Love you, boys.

21:55.634 --> 21:58.667
( music playing on radio )
Is that George?

21:58.767 --> 22:00.300
Yeah.

22:04.134 --> 22:06.034
Hey, George.
Here's trouble.

22:06.134 --> 22:07.600
Jonah:
What are you doing?

22:07.700 --> 22:09.867
Cruising.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.700
S'up, dox?
What's up, brother?

22:12.934 --> 22:14.134
Boys.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.267
Wanna see something
pretty awesome?

22:16.367 --> 22:19.467
Moses: Yeah.
Yeah, what is it?

22:19.567 --> 22:22.567
Oh fuck!
That's gun as.
Oh, that's sick.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.500
What is it?
Traditional Tongan
machete, brother.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.300
Sharpest shit out, ay.
Shit. Can I hold it?

22:26.400 --> 22:28.467
Yeah, man. Here.
It's pretty heavy, eh?

22:28.567 --> 22:31.367
Oh fuck, man.
Yeah, we don't know about
it's an antique or something,

22:31.467 --> 22:32.934
but it was probably
used to kill someone.

22:33.034 --> 22:35.334
Oh, really?
Fuck.
Yeah, bro.

22:35.434 --> 22:39.234
Wow.
Hey, you guys wanna
do something brave?

22:39.334 --> 22:41.134
Something that proves to us
that you're real men?

22:41.234 --> 22:43.434
What,
like something dangerous?

22:43.534 --> 22:44.534
Yeah.

22:44.634 --> 22:47.400
Something that might
kill you, man.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.400
What?
You scared or something?

22:50.500 --> 22:52.834
Someone might
take you out, man.

22:52.934 --> 22:54.234
Maybe. What?

22:54.334 --> 22:56.134
( scoffs )
Come one, Mr. Tattoo Man.

22:56.234 --> 22:57.967
Thought you were supposed
to be some sort of warrior.

22:58.067 --> 23:01.667
What are you scared of?
Um, noth-- nothing.
I'm not scared of anything.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.100
If you boys do
this one brave thing for me,

23:06.200 --> 23:08.800
I'll let you take that machete
home for a night.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.834
Oh!
Yeah, okay.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.767
What do
you want us to do?

23:12.867 --> 23:14.134
You ever played Flat Cat?

23:14.234 --> 23:15.534
No, what is that?

23:15.634 --> 23:18.100
Well, you lie
on the road, right,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.067
as flat as you can.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.534
but you don't move
until I say.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.867
When a car comes,
I'll tell you to jump up.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.067
You don't move quick enough,
you're gonna get run over
like a cat,

23:27.167 --> 23:28.500
then you'll become
a flat cat, eh?

23:28.600 --> 23:30.667
I'll do it.
Yeah, I'll do it too.

23:30.767 --> 23:33.100
And then we get
to keep that?
Yeah.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.800
Okay.
Get on the road then.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.067
Big boys.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.434
Just here?
Yeah, in the middle, bro.

23:45.867 --> 23:47.934
All right, stay down.
There's a car coming.

23:48.034 --> 23:52.767
Oh no.
Lie down.
Put your arms down, man.

23:52.867 --> 23:54.300
No, don't move, stay.
Stay?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.834
Stay, man.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.934
All right, get up,
get up. Go go go.
( tires screech )

23:59.034 --> 24:00.367
( Jonah breathes heavily )
All right, man.

24:00.467 --> 24:01.834
( car honks )
Fuck! Sorry, car!

24:01.934 --> 24:03.867
( both laugh )

24:03.967 --> 24:07.067
That was fucking scary as!
George: Shit, man.
You guys got balls, man.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.834
( laughs )
Jonah: Whoa!

24:08.934 --> 24:11.267
We nearly got run over!
You guys are brave, bro.
You guys are mental.

24:11.367 --> 24:14.067
Don't matter, don't matter.
Respect, bro. Respect, bro.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.300
Yo, for that...
here's your prize, boys.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.800
( chuckles )
We get to keep it?
Yeah, bro,

24:18.900 --> 24:20.100
just for the night,
man, all right?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.900
Take it home--
don't show anyone, all right?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.567
Put it in your bag, Moses.
Put it in your bag.
Be careful, eh?

24:23.667 --> 24:25.434
Yeah.
Honestly, bro,
you guys did it, man.

24:25.534 --> 24:28.334
Fuck, man. You should feel
my heart right now.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.000
It's beating so fast.
Jonah the man.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.167
Moses: Yeah.
Fuck that.

24:31.267 --> 24:33.300
Melody:
Hi, George.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.800
Jonah:
Melody, did you get
all the glue off you?

24:35.900 --> 24:37.767
Yeah. Hate you
for making me do that.

24:37.867 --> 24:38.900
It was gross.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.034
( chuckles )
She likes you, siana.

24:42.134 --> 24:43.334
I can tell, man.
You think so?

24:43.434 --> 24:45.067
Yeah. You like her?
*

24:45.167 --> 24:47.767
Yeah, she's my cousin,
but she's hot as.

24:47.867 --> 24:51.200
( chuckles )
So what do we have to do
to be in The Soldierz?

24:51.300 --> 24:52.734
What, you wanna be
in The Soldierz, tough boy?

24:52.834 --> 24:55.600
You gotta do something braver
than just Flat Cat, man.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.767
That's how
we all became Soldierz.
It ain't easy.

24:57.867 --> 24:59.834
Anyways, man,
catch youse up, bro.
I gotta go.

24:59.934 --> 25:01.367
See you, Georgie.
