01:52.404 --> 01:55.157
Goddamn bunch of cutthroats.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.415
Oh, shit.

02:03.457 --> 02:07.970
Boy, they'd leave me belly-up out here
if they knew I was getting ready to run.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.053
- Don't you make a noise when you walk?
- Uh-uh.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.476
Hey, wait a minute.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.846
You got yourself all done up, Ruby.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.472
- What are you up to?
- Here.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.058
Oh, no you don't. Uh-uh.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.185
Ain't no trading today, Ruby.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.732
And not no more, neither.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.024
You folks gone too far.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.525
Trooper been snooping around.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.323
Air Force been through here twice.

02:31.443 --> 02:35.744
You folks have to go rob a goddamn
Air Force PX for God's sakes.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.161
We're hungry.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.250
No one comes through back there anymore.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.040
What did you get?

02:41.161 --> 02:44.506
Whiskey and radios.
I ain't got nothing to eat.

02:47.876 --> 02:52.431
I'm sorry, Ruby. I know you're starving,
but I ain't got nothing else to trade.

02:52.547 --> 02:57.223
I got no more gas,
no more cartridges, no more food.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.063
And the folks in Corn Creek
have cut me off already.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.808
They even talked of
blocking off this whole section

03:02.933 --> 03:06.778
and marching the National Guard through,
see what they can find.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.398
You coyotes better watch
your p's and q's for a spell.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.823
- Take me with you.
- What?

03:12.943 --> 03:16.368
So that's it. You want to get out.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.665
Do you think you could pass out there
with the regular folks?

03:21.785 --> 03:24.504
You don't know a knife and fork
from your five fingers.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.840
And you stink like a horse.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.675
You're getting out. You take me, too.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.544
Does the pack know you're doing this?

03:30.669 --> 03:32.342
Does Jupiter know?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.557
Why, he'd cut you to pieces
if I told him you were going over the hill.

03:36.174 --> 03:40.554
If my pa knew you was getting out,
he'd rip your lungs out.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.353
- Hello? Anybody around?
- Get in here.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.895
That'll be the State Troopers.

03:45.016 --> 03:49.112
They'll toss you in jail and throw the key
up a wild sow's ass and holler, "Suey!"

03:49.229 --> 03:51.903
Well, I'll take a look around.
I don't see any...

03:52.023 --> 03:53.991
Didn't hear you. I was just cleaning up.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.952
Fill it up and check the oil and water.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.915
Give you what I got. Ain't got much.
I'm just closing down.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.414
Morning.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.927
Don't you mind them,
they just want to play.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.592
Beauty, get down in there. Down now!

04:14.713 --> 04:17.808
That's... That's a good girl.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.016
Odd.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.011
I'm telling you,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.605
Yeah, I wonder how far it is
to the nearest cheeseburger.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.191
We don't usually get folk up this way.
Where you heading?

04:26.308 --> 04:28.686
California. L.A.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.484
Movie stars and fancy cars.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.448
California?

04:33.565 --> 04:36.193
You sure as hell
off the beaten track for that.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.867
Yeah, well, we're just making a stop
around here first.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.739
You know this place around here?
The desert?

04:40.864 --> 04:41.990
Why?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.914
- You got a bathroom around here?
- Yeah, round in back. Round in back.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.413
I need to make a litter dump.
You got a place to throw some trash?

04:47.537 --> 04:51.542
Oh hell. Use the whole damn desert
for all I care.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.839
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. Do you have your key?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.086
Good.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.135
How are my two baby girls doing?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.056
Fabulous.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.148
Hey, piggy, piggy.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.710
So, anyway, we thought
we'd take a little detour and go see it.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.125
It's supposed to be a real silver mine.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.374
Well, anyway, that's why I was asking.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.923
You see, it's my Aunt Mildred's gift
to Bob and me on our silver anniversary,

05:35.043 --> 05:36.545
and that's tomorrow.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.389
Lady, they ain't no silver left
back in there.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.976
Besides, the Air Force uses part of this
as a gunnery range.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.603
You folks just forget that foolishness
and go onto California.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.610
- That'll be $6.80.
- OK.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.157
- I've got no change.
- Oh, that figures.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.117
- Detective, huh?
- That's right.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.453
Bob just retired from the police force.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.538
He had to a little early
because of his heart.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.078
Referring to Strike Creek Road.
Do you know where it is?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.998
Look, Mister, don't take your family
back in there.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.214
The silver's been gone 40 years now.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.583
Besides, there's nothing back in there
but animals.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.133
Animals? You mean nobody lives back there?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.756
Nobody you'd want
to meet, lady, believe me.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.219
See? There's nothing back here.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.397
Jeeze! Look at this place.

06:30.214 --> 06:32.567
What's the matter? See something?

06:34.436 --> 06:35.938
Ugh!

06:37.856 --> 06:39.699
- What?
- Mercury!

06:39.816 --> 06:43.116
I didn't do anything wrong.
I just came to trade.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.600
Grandpa Freddy, he says he's running away.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.455
Shh! Big mouth. Let's go.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.877
Come here. Come here.
Hold it. Come here. Shh!

07:00.795 --> 07:03.093
Come on, Doug.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.309
Come on.
He must have some animals back there.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.303
Shh.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.226
There's nothing, dummy.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.813
Come on. Come on.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.238
Come on.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.543
Yeah, you'd better check
your grandchildren there, Mister.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.754
I think one of them's cut himself
on the window back there.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.919
- I'll check it. Thanks.
- That's OK.

07:39.918 --> 07:43.343
You folks go right to California
and have a good trip.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.812
You folks stay on the main road now,
you hear?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.602
Stay on the main road!

08:25.630 --> 08:27.132
Let's get out of here.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.678
What the fuck?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.482
Oh, Lord.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.400
There'll be hell to pay now.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.630
Jupiter. Papa.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.842
Papa Hunter, identify.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.006
Mama. Pluto.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.800
You see a station wagon and a trailer?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.888
That's what Mercury said,

09:08.006 --> 09:10.008
if you can believe him.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.135
They coming.

09:15.472 --> 09:19.067
We're lost. The old creep told you
not to get off the road.

09:19.184 --> 09:23.280
The old bastard probably snuck up here
and ripped off our mine

09:23.396 --> 09:25.319
and that's why he doesn't want us up here.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.068
We'll be French fries, human French fries.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.992
We are not going to be French fries.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.740
We're right here someplace
on this little blue road.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.124
Mother, this road is not a blue line.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.338
It's a dotted line
if it's on the map at all.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.502
Oh, Jesus.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.970
Nellis Air Force Base Nuclear Testing Site,
closed to the public.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.468
Holy shit, Daddy!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.471
All right, everybody shuts up. That's it.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.476
Man alive.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.318
We're not on a bomb range
and we're not goddamn lost.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.483
And we are...

10:09.567 --> 10:11.911
Jesus Christ on a crutch, what was that?

10:15.381 --> 10:18.200
Daddy, slow down a little bit, will you?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.038
Daddy, we're going to lose the trailer.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.714
Daddy, Mum is...!

10:33.216 --> 10:35.344
Bob, watch!

10:48.606 --> 10:51.610
You guys and your stupid silver mine.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.077
Doug, are you OK?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.447
Open the door. I think the door is jammed.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.791
Why don't you try unlocking it, creep?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.205
Oh, I got it.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.876
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.557
I feel like I've just been through
my first California earthquake.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.301
- How's the baby?
- She's fine. Mum's got her.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.678
I think we were lucky.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.476
- My finches OK?
- Aren't you even going to ask how I am?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.349
Oh, get out of my life, Bobby.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.397
- Look, I'm wounded.
- What is it?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.316
It's just ketchup, folks.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.360
Look out.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.862
Oh, you're so stupid.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.707
Twenty-five years I'm a cop

11:43.828 --> 11:46.707
in the worst goddamn precinct
in Cleveland.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.375
Niggers shoot arrows at me

11:49.500 --> 11:52.470
and the hillbillies throw dogs
off the roofs at me.

11:53.463 --> 11:57.843
I'm even shot at on two separate
occasions by my own men,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.811
but none of these bastards
ever come as close to killing me

12:00.929 --> 12:05.480
as my own goddamn wife and her
goddamn road maps and her wrong turns

12:05.600 --> 12:08.228
and her goddamn
hysterical screaming and her...

12:08.353 --> 12:09.900
Watch your language.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.651
You watch your heart, too.
You know what Dr Springer said.

12:14.776 --> 12:19.373
Dr Springer can take his stethoscope
and shove it...

12:19.489 --> 12:22.959
into his little black bag sideways.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.803
It's a turkey buzzard.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.473
It's the janitor of the desert.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.766
Does that mean there's a town nearby?

12:43.554 --> 12:46.603
Like when sailors spot a bird at sea
and know they're near land?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.192
Yeah.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.399
No.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.816
So pretty.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.652
Pretty girl.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.997
Threw the hitch right off the back.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.458
What's the verdict, big fella?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.583
- Well, the goddamn axle snapped.
- Oh no.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.463
Forget it. Forget it.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.382
What do we do now?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.254
We walk, baby.

14:00.423 --> 14:04.473
You know, Marlon Perkins says that
rattlesnakes can reach lengths of 20 feet

14:04.594 --> 14:06.312
and can kill you in eight minutes.

14:08.288 --> 14:12.770
Then you better not shoot until you
see the whites of their fangs, son.

14:12.894 --> 14:16.194
- Or was it eight feet and 20 minutes?
- Oh, Ma.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.032
Thank goodness the boys at the precinct

14:18.149 --> 14:20.652
presented me with this howitzer
when I retired.

14:20.777 --> 14:25.123
Sure wouldn't want to go looking
for those pythons without it.

14:25.239 --> 14:29.790
If it's all the same to you, Bob Carter,
I'll put my faith in the good Lord

14:29.911 --> 14:34.508
and a little gunpowder
rather than coyotes and rattlesnakes.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
This place must be crawling with them.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.004
Well, Katy's taking this all calmly.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.223
You OK?

14:44.175 --> 14:45.518
I hate it out here.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.683
It's just uncomfortable. That's all.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.647
It's more than uncomfortable.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.697
Lynne, honey,
would you get me my jacket, please?

15:45.528 --> 15:47.201
What is it?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.698
Nothing.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.123
I don't get it. Why can't we
raise anybody on the CB?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.244
Here.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.212
It looks to me like
these hills are full of iron,

15:55.329 --> 15:57.832
and if that's the case, you're not
going to get a radio signal past them.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.129
Would you hold this please?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.376
I'm going to head North,

16:00.501 --> 16:03.129
something on the map that looks like
a military installation here.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.471
OK, fine.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.307
You ought to have a gun too, Doug.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.974
We only have two guns, and I think
one of them ought to stay with you guys.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.348
All right, Doug. You walk out
six or seven miles and get back.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.067
I'll walk out as far as the old geezer's
service station, and...

16:16.184 --> 16:18.903
You can't get there and back before dark.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.647
It's only 15 miles back.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.569
Sweetheart, I'll get there about sundown.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.864
If the old guy's there, I'll borrow his pickup.
If he's not there, I'll borrow his phone.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.783
But what if the old jerk
doesn't have a phone?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.952
- Then I'll pawn it.
- Daddy, don't.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.372
Look, you stay close to the trailer,
and don't bust Bobby's chops.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.167
- He is in charge.
- That creep isn't in charge of me.

16:36.287 --> 16:40.337
Hey! Another outburst like that,
and I'll confine you to quarters.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.171
All right, men,
synchronise the watches. It's 3:38.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.469
If you're not back by midnight, we'll
have to board the submarine without you.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.388
Can we have a word of prayer first?

16:49.509 --> 16:52.638
- Oh, mother, for crying in a bucket.
- Brenda!

16:52.762 --> 16:55.606
Just to ask the Lord to watch over us all.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.310
Is that too much to ask?

17:00.728 --> 17:01.900
Bob?

17:08.653 --> 17:11.873
Heavenly Father, watch over us
for the rest of this day.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.367
Keep us in thy care in Jesus' name.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.914
Amen.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.752
So long, troops.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.807
Pluto?

17:29.924 --> 17:33.598
They stuck good, easy pickings now.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.454
Beauty! Come here, girl.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.831
Come on, Beauty. Come on, Beauty.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.339
Beauty. Come on, Beauty.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.800
Come on, girl. Let's go.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.261
Well, at least it's cooler now.

18:07.378 --> 18:10.472
- Oh, bring some plates would you, Bob?
- Sure.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.515
- It is cooler, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Fantastic!

18:14.635 --> 18:16.854
Now we'll all freeze to death.

18:16.971 --> 18:21.272
This is a great way to spend the eve
of your 25th wedding anniversary.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.269
Frozen French fries.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.772
A huge clump of human French fries

18:25.896 --> 18:29.992
was found stuck to a camper trailer
this morning by...

18:30.484 --> 18:31.861
But who'd ever find us?

18:31.986 --> 18:34.205
Well, it's kind of a pretty place.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.745
There's certainly plenty of the sunshine
and fresh air.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.710
- This much fresh air's unhealthy.
- Oh, it's good for you.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.501
It makes me want to puke,
if you really want to know.

18:43.422 --> 18:47.339
- It gives me the creeps.
- I suppose it's my fault we got lost.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.053
Mother, don't be ridiculous.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.219
It was Daddy's idea to go looking
around for this mine without any help.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.640
We'd be in California by now
if we'd stayed on the interstate.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.263
Showers and gin and tonics.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.310
- The beach.
- Fresh clothes.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.895
I wonder what's bugging her?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.614
Maybe there's some rattlesnakes
prowling around.

19:08.731 --> 19:12.486
You know what Freud would say about
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Ma?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.990
I wonder why the beast isn't chiming in.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.162
Beast never barks
until he's ready for the kill.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.377
He likes to catch his victims unawares.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.874
Hey, you know you're right.
Remember that poodle he killed in Miami?

19:25.998 --> 19:29.218
- Do I?
- Oh boy, was that lady ever fit to be tied.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.053
Was Daddy ever mad.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.798
He had to pay vet bills for a dead poodle.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.387
All right, creep, what's your story?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.684
Brenda, don't.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.183
Beauty!

19:43.307 --> 19:45.059
Beauty, get back here!

19:45.893 --> 19:47.065
Beauty!

19:47.186 --> 19:49.234
Bobby!

19:57.905 --> 19:59.452
Beauty!

20:02.785 --> 20:04.332
Here, Beauty.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.797
Here, Beauty. Come here. Come here, girl.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.008
Beauty!

20:10.584 --> 20:13.554
Hey, pig, come here.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.218
Beauty, come here.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.735
Beauty!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.495
Beauty!

20:39.488 --> 20:41.240
Hey, girl.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.036
Beauty!

21:38.964 --> 21:40.807
Bobby!

21:41.717 --> 21:44.015
Do you hear him answer?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.308
No.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.479
Bobby, come down.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.068
Bobby, come down.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.168
Beauty?

22:36.021 --> 22:40.652
You folks stay
on the main road now, you hear?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.913
Stay on the main road.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.033
Nothing out there but animals.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.283
Animals.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.128
Animals. Animals.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.402
Ooh...

23:24.445 --> 23:26.994
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.458
It must have dropped 20 degrees
in the last hour.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.753
God, I thought I was out.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.714
Hello. Testing.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.425
Hello? Anybody there?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.920
Testing, testing.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.174
Maypole, maypole, maypole, maypole.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.972
This is Mama Bear Carter calling.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.766
Do any of you bears have your ears up?

23:51.805 --> 23:55.605
Gosh, I can't seem to remember
how this works.

23:55.726 --> 23:59.026
- It's 'mayday', Mum, not 'maypole'.
- Hmm?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.069
- Mayday.
- Oh.

24:01.190 --> 24:04.615
- Did you put it on battery?
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.783
Well, here, let me.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.790
Mayday, mayday.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.628
This is mobile unit 2345 CB.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.834
We are stranded and in need ofhelp.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.924
Do you copy?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.644
What the hell was that?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.973
It sounded like some sort of animal.

24:36.475 --> 24:41.231
Yeah, well, animals around here
are smart enough to run radios,

24:41.355 --> 24:43.858
we're up shit creek without a paddle.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.203
You know you never used language like that

24:47.319 --> 24:49.492
before you moved to New York City.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.661
Where's Bobby and the men, anyway?

25:15.305 --> 25:17.103
Brenda?

25:24.565 --> 25:26.192
Brenda?

25:27.192 --> 25:29.115
Bobby!

25:33.615 --> 25:36.164
Beast, come back here.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.164
Beast.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.876
Bobby?

25:44.001 --> 25:47.050
Brenda? You there?

25:48.464 --> 25:50.592
Just a minute, Lynne.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.267
Bobby?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.447
Bobby?

26:21.538 --> 26:24.291
How does this damn thing work anyway?

26:31.715 --> 26:32.932
Bobby?

26:40.307 --> 26:44.562
Bobby, where have you been?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.865
Bobby, your face... What happened?

26:49.900 --> 26:51.743
Bobby?

28:43.472 --> 28:46.772
Get your stupid neck
out of that belt, you jackass.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.822
Should have left you hanging
after you took a shot at me.

28:54.358 --> 28:57.532
Not until you tell me
what the hell is going on.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.783
You're trespassing, that's what.
Give me that.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.502
You always try to stop trespassers
by hanging yourself?

29:05.619 --> 29:08.543
I thought you was somebody else.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.674
- How's your family?
- Well...

29:11.792 --> 29:13.715
The car skidded off the road,
we broke an axle.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.088
They're back at the trailer.
They're all OK.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.308
Like hell they are. Give me that booze.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.268
There's something you should know about.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.559
Yeah, well, what is it?

29:27.057 --> 29:29.105
Come on, Beast.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.864
Daddy and Doug back yet?

29:34.982 --> 29:37.076
Not yet.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.069
Didn't you find Beauty?

29:40.529 --> 29:42.657
She must have run off.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.083
Give me that.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.418
Come on, Beast.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.758
Come on, sweetheart...

30:03.093 --> 30:07.269
Back in '29, this place was spanking new,

30:07.389 --> 30:10.984
and me and my wife Martha
had a little baby girl

30:11.101 --> 30:13.980
so pretty and good, we couldn't believe,

30:14.104 --> 30:16.402
and another kid on the way.

30:17.274 --> 30:21.780
But when Martha had this one,
something went wrong.

30:21.903 --> 30:26.124
This thing she give me,
something happened.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.254
He was so big...

30:32.164 --> 30:36.214
He came out sideways
and almost tore poor Martha apart.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.469
He weighed 20 pounds
and was hairy as a monkey.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.059
When he was 10 years old,

30:45.052 --> 30:47.271
he was big as I was.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.475
Accidents were happening all the time.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.728
Dogs falling in the well.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.446
I even found chickens
with their heads bit off.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.736
Then in August of '39,

30:58.857 --> 31:01.531
I was in town getting supplies,

31:01.651 --> 31:04.825
and the whole damn house
burned to the ground.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.330
My little baby girl was a cinder
when I found her,

31:09.451 --> 31:12.455
but this monster kid wasn't even singed.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.751
I knew he'd done it.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.968
I hit him with a tyre iron,
and I split his face wide open.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.462
How bad was it?

31:20.587 --> 31:22.134
I thought I'd killed him.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.977
I was afraid they'd come and take me away,

31:28.095 --> 31:31.474
so I took him out in the desert
and I left him there.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.523
I figured if he wasn't dead,

31:35.644 --> 31:38.523
he couldn't live more than two hours
out there in that heat.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.858
Then it would all be over with.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.701
And you think his ghost
is still trying to track you?

31:43.819 --> 31:45.537
That was a long time ago.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.908
Long enough for him to steal
a whore that nobody would miss.

31:49.032 --> 31:52.536
Long enough to raise a passel
of wild kids.

31:52.661 --> 31:56.507
Long enough for a devil kid
to grow up to be a devil man.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.555
What the hell is this?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.519
That's just some stuff that I...

33:09.321 --> 33:12.416
You want some cheese on this?
There's plenty left.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.785
I don't want anything.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.583
What's the matter, don't you feel well?

33:16.703 --> 33:19.297
I'm just not hungry.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.293
- Your face still bothering you?
- No.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.342
- Did anybody try to CB while I was gone?
- We tried.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.636
We tried. Nothing...

33:29.424 --> 33:35.181
Well, one time we got something
that sounded an Epstein caller.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.932
What do you mean?

33:37.057 --> 33:41.608
Well, it sounded sort of like
heavy breathing, didn't it, Mum?

33:44.272 --> 33:46.491
It, er... it was static.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.361
It wasn't.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.871
What was that?

34:20.516 --> 34:22.645
Aw, Jesus.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.856
What's going on?

34:43.706 --> 34:46.051
Mummy!

34:46.167 --> 34:48.511
Daddy!

34:48.628 --> 34:50.551
Help me!

34:50.672 --> 34:53.094
Daddy!

34:53.216 --> 34:55.889
Bogeyman get me!

34:56.011 --> 34:58.606
Daddy!

34:59.723 --> 35:01.191
You son of a bitch!

35:11.985 --> 35:13.908
Faster. Faster.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.623
Mummy, Daddy. Faster.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.742
Your chest hurt? Faster. Faster.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.209
Looks like Daddy going to fall down.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.501
Over here.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.870
Over here.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.139
Here.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.770
Daddy all gone?

35:51.524 --> 35:53.276
Daddy all gone?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.702
Pluto.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.045
- Papa Jupe?
- Papa Jupe.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.795
We about ready.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.230
Hey.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.659
You mind pointing that thing
somewhere else?

36:34.776 --> 36:36.403
Oh.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.829
Thank you.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.725
It gets cold out there.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.634
Here, I brought you a present.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.764
What's the matter with you?

36:58.842 --> 37:00.560
Well, for one thing, Dad's not back yet.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.645
Oh, hell.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.639
I wouldn't expect him this early.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.233
He had a lot further to go than I did.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.148
Besides, it's slow-going out there.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.021
Where are the dogs?

37:11.146 --> 37:14.867
Beast broke his chain about
an hour ago and he ran off.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.860
Oh, yeah?

37:17.318 --> 37:19.320
And Beauty...

37:19.904 --> 37:21.998
Well...

37:22.115 --> 37:24.334
- Beauty, sh...
- It's Doug.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.919
Hey!

37:26.035 --> 37:27.378
Doug's back!

37:27.495 --> 37:30.419
I knew when you smelled food
you'd show up!

37:30.540 --> 37:32.713
Hey, gorgeous.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.928
Get out of here.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.802
- How you doing?
- Did you find anything?

37:37.922 --> 37:40.425
Oh, yeah. Lots of stuff. There's, er...

37:40.550 --> 37:44.475
I found a tower and a dump
about five miles out of here.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.598
All kinds of good stuff. Look at this!

37:46.723 --> 37:50.444
Look at all of this. I mean, it's no wonder
we're paying higher taxes.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.937
They're throwing this stuff away.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.735
Did you go any further?
Did you find any people?

37:54.856 --> 37:56.529
Oh, no. There's no people.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.448
And I couldn't go any further
because the road just stops right there.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.162
Just ended right there.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.782
- Is there any food left? I am so hungry.
- Oh, come and get it.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.750
- Come on.
- OK.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.084
Listen, we got to go out there

38:07.202 --> 38:09.580
'cause there's enough stuff
to open an army surplus store,

38:09.704 --> 38:11.456
honest to God.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.926
Ma?

39:22.443 --> 39:25.697
What's the matter?
You don't like dog anymore?

39:27.198 --> 39:28.871
I like it.

39:28.992 --> 39:34.294
Maybe dog's too good
for a runaway slut like you.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.042
The dog's ghost
is talking out there tonight.

39:45.258 --> 39:48.979
Another dog.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.312
Great big stud.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.146
Mama.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.147
Mama?

39:59.272 --> 40:01.195
Let me come inside?

40:01.316 --> 40:03.193
Mama?

40:03.318 --> 40:05.616
Goodies around here...

40:07.488 --> 40:10.241
...means he ain't around there.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.243
Where?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.791
Never you mind.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.279
Bobby? Come on in.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.405
Don't catch a cold.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.298
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.964
OK.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.931
Don't lock that too hard, old bean,
we're going out in a second.

41:15.932 --> 41:18.776
- Hey, where you going?
- The sack.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.942
I don't think you should sleep
in the station wagon tonight.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.408
- Why not?
- Look, sleep in here on the floor.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.369
- What are you, nuts?
- Look, Doug, I've got to talk to you.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.577
- All set?
- Yeah. All set.

41:33.741 --> 41:37.996
Hey. I guarantee you
that he'll be back here by 9:30.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.249
Bobby's worried that rattlesnakes
are going to get Big Bob.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.502
- It isn't that.
- Hey.

41:43.626 --> 41:48.006
You better worry about what Big Bob
will do to the rattlesnakes.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.348
Come on, you.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.515
Uh...

41:55.888 --> 42:01.941
Listen. If he's not back here by 11 o'clock,
we'll go out and meet him, OK?

42:02.061 --> 42:03.984
Sleep well.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.344
I'm scared.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.382
Beast?

44:49.020 --> 44:50.647
Beast?

44:55.234 --> 44:58.283
Beast! Come here, boy! Come on!

45:10.515 --> 45:12.260
Beast?

45:25.681 --> 45:27.524
Ugh!

45:32.980 --> 45:34.857
Beast?

45:35.608 --> 45:37.076
Beast?

45:37.193 --> 45:38.970
Hey, boy.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.448
Come here, boy.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.579
Just...

45:54.710 --> 45:56.087
Come on.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.913
Stupid...

46:42.216 --> 46:44.310
Jesus!

47:34.518 --> 47:37.237
What do you want?

47:57.458 --> 47:59.836
I mean, the amount of privacy we get
on this trip has been zero.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.510
I'm not the one knocking on windows
in the middle of the night.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.642
All right, this better be good.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.521
- I need your keys.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

48:15.518 --> 48:16.940
I locked myself out.

48:19.397 --> 48:23.573
- Couldn't you wait?
- Goddamnit! Give me the keys, please!

48:33.327 --> 48:36.922
Look, something weird
is going on around here.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.461
Dad's not back yet.

48:38.582 --> 48:42.086
You said that you heard heavy breathing
on the CB,

48:42.211 --> 48:44.589
and now Beast is out there
barking like he's hurt.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.550
Oh, Bobby, it's probably Beauty.

48:47.675 --> 48:51.020
She always sounds like that
when she barks.

49:00.194 --> 49:02.114
- Beauty is dead.
- What?

49:02.231 --> 49:04.984
She's been dead since this afternoon.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.986
Beauty's dead?

49:07.987 --> 49:10.160
What happened?
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

49:10.881 --> 49:12.875
I tried.

49:16.078 --> 49:18.831
When I found her she'd been gutted.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.799
Somebody slit her.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.133
It was pretty bad.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.343
I... I was so scared, I ran away.

49:27.006 --> 49:28.553
OK.

49:28.674 --> 49:32.178
You just hold on right here.
I'll get a flashlight, and we'll take a look.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.517
OK. Hang on. Come on, come on.

49:37.641 --> 49:39.439
- You stay here.
- I will not stay here.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.441
Do it.

49:47.151 --> 49:49.370
Oh, my God!

49:49.487 --> 49:51.785
Oh, God. Ethel!

49:51.906 --> 49:54.284
Help me, Ethel!

49:55.159 --> 49:58.038
Oh, God! Help me!

49:58.537 --> 50:00.915
- Ethel, don't go out there.
- Let me go!

50:01.040 --> 50:03.759
- Ma!
- Put it out!

50:10.090 --> 50:12.388
Brenda?

50:13.052 --> 50:15.680
Brenda? Keep an eye on the baby, OK?

50:17.139 --> 50:19.312
Oh, my God!

50:19.433 --> 50:21.527
Ethel!

50:21.644 --> 50:24.773
Help me, Ethel! Help me!

50:24.897 --> 50:27.400
Papa Jupiter. This here is Mars.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.402
You and Pluto in, Mars?

50:29.485 --> 50:31.908
We in, Papa. We in.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.962
Help me!

50:41.080 --> 50:43.424
God!

50:51.549 --> 50:53.972
Oh, my God!

50:54.093 --> 50:56.312
Ethel!

51:53.861 --> 51:55.829
You son of a bitch!

51:56.864 --> 51:58.161
You wait.

51:58.782 --> 52:01.205
You wait till you get to be a man.

52:37.363 --> 52:39.661
Baby's fat.

52:39.782 --> 52:41.910
You fat.

52:42.034 --> 52:44.832
Fat and juicy.

53:10.229 --> 53:12.982
Oh, that... that's not my Bob.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.950
He needs some water.

53:15.067 --> 53:17.536
He needs some water.
Would you get it, please?

53:17.653 --> 53:21.365
That's not my Bob! That's not my Bob!

53:21.490 --> 53:24.084
That's not my Bob!

53:24.201 --> 53:26.249
Not my Bob!

53:26.370 --> 53:28.498
That's not my Bob!

53:28.622 --> 53:30.624
He wants some water. No, it's not Bob.

53:30.749 --> 53:33.923
Lynne, Lynne, please,
take her to get some water, please.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.512
I'll take you, Mama.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.635
And some whiskey and blankets too.

53:38.715 --> 53:42.140
- That's not my Bob!
- Whiskey and blankets.

53:44.012 --> 53:45.855
You all right, man?

53:54.898 --> 53:57.071
What... what are you doing?
Where are you going?

53:57.192 --> 53:58.865
You're not my father.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.831
I'm going to get those bastards.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.619
- Bobby?
- I will.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.145
So long, Papa.

54:32.019 --> 54:34.898
Women coming, Mars.
Let's get what we came for and get out.

54:38.692 --> 54:41.445
- Katy!
- What was that?

54:41.570 --> 54:43.322
Oh, Katy!

54:44.573 --> 54:46.746
Where the hell are you going with my baby?

54:46.867 --> 54:48.835
Get out of my way, bitch.

54:59.797 --> 55:02.266
Get out of here!

55:09.515 --> 55:10.641
You...

55:45.300 --> 55:46.927
Take the baby.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.054
You better move your ass.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.119
I come back for you later, girlie.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.302
It's all right...

56:25.799 --> 56:27.676
It's all right. It's all right.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.269
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.686
Don't go, baby.

57:11.803 --> 57:13.846
Don't go away.

57:14.898 --> 57:17.021
Don't go away.

57:35.726 --> 57:38.305
OK. OK.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.350
Oh, Jesus!

57:54.012 --> 57:56.140
Katy?

57:59.226 --> 58:01.979
Get her inside and see to your mum.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.734
Oh, my God.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.786
Why are you doing this?

58:16.827 --> 58:18.875
What do you want?

58:25.377 --> 58:27.630
Damn you!

58:33.677 --> 58:36.021
Give me back my baby.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.807
My Catherine.

58:46.648 --> 58:48.696
Please.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.998
Come on.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.302
Yeah, he's still got a gun.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.889
Yeah, I got bullets.

59:16.261 --> 59:19.140
Mercury? You paying attention, Mercury?

59:23.310 --> 59:26.439
You know how to use that thing?
Huh, Mercury?

59:27.481 --> 59:29.199
Wait a minute.

59:29.316 --> 59:31.910
I see you... you got something to eat!

59:32.027 --> 59:34.622
We got the goods, and how, Mercury.

59:35.864 --> 59:39.914
- Is that a baby?
- You be a good, dog, you get some.

59:40.035 --> 59:42.333
Mama Jupi so happy.

59:42.454 --> 59:44.832
Papa Jupi so happy.

59:45.874 --> 59:50.050
Maybe I make a joke like last time
and eat the toes.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.764
You think everybody laugh?

59:53.881 --> 59:56.556
We always laugh at you, Mercury.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.519
Coming through.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.516
OK, Pluto.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.253
What?

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.590
I thought I heard something,
rocks falling.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:32.262
You got rocks in your head, asshole.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.382
Let's go.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:03.793
- I heard you tried to run away.
- No, Papa, no.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.754
I heard you messing with Grandpa Fred.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.289
I fixed Grandpa Fred good.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.015
I like fixing people good.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.944
Bobby?

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.758
What you got there?

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.348
Is that what I think it is?

01:01:58.465 --> 01:01:59.762
Oh, yeah.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:03.012
About time we got
some powerful food around here.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.639
- We're going to eat it, too.
- Call in Mercury!

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:08.142
- We don't need no watch no more.
- OK, Papa.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:12.897
We caught us a young Thanksgiving turkey.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.483
What we going to do?

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.576
They got our food, our ammo,

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.196
they killed Dad and Lynn
and they got the baby.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.369
And they're going to be back.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.752
What are we going to do?

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.464
She hasn't said a word all night.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.091
Mercury don't answer, Papa Ju.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.139
Don't answer?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.058
Maybe you don't know how to work it right.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.226
I don't think that's it,
I told you I heard something.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:54.855
- You heard what?
- I'll go find him.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:04.039
You go do that.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:14.717
Did you kill them all like I told you to?

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.429
Did you kill them all like I said?

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:26.098
Such a small place, a trailer.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.019
When it's messy, it's so messy.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.984
Yeah.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.904
Daddy back yet?

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:40.692
No, not yet.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.453
Where's the kids, back yet?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:52.705
Yeah, Brenda's right here
and Bobby's in the kitchen.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.713
Drinking Coke, I bet.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.052
Lynn sleep?

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.975
Yeah.

01:04:09.227 --> 01:04:11.476
Can I get you anything?

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:14.309
Another blanket, can I have one?

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:16.816
It's chilly.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:21.154
This will keep you warm.
This will keep you nice and warm.

01:04:23.217 --> 01:04:24.911
Thank you.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.949
Thanks.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.751
Oh, no!

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.418
- Turn the lights on, please.
- Oh Christ, the battery must be dead.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:39.418
- Bobby, I'm scared.
- I think the bastards took the lantern.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.386
Coming back for me!
Coming to get me, Bobby!

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.222
Shut up, will you?

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.467
I hear them outside.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:01.190
- It's OK.
- Maybe I got that son of a bitch.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:04.447
Mercury? Mercury, you all right?

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.569
Mercury, where are you?

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.421
Cover me.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.974
Hello, Papa? Hello, Papa Jupe?

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:39.486
Hold on Pluto, I'll get him.

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:42.196
The beast?

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.691
- That sound like the beast to you?
- I don't think it was.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.989
Yeah, I think it was.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.329
I'm telling you,
they can do the beast perfect.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.134
Bobby, is it all right?

01:06:09.948 --> 01:06:11.552
Beast, what are you trying to do?

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.017
Oh, get off of me.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.891
Where have you been?
Huh? Where have you been?

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:19.859
You bring this?

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:23.321
This is Jupiter, what you find?

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:27.033
Mercury's dead, Papa.
He's at the bottom of the cliff.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:31.030
Mercury's dead? He fall?

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.077
He was pushed.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:36.919
Pushed? Who the hell pushed my boy?

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.246
Devil dog.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.089
The big bastard's tracks
are right on Mercury's chest.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.333
Good boy!

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.927
Pluto! You come back here.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:49.469
We got some things to do.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.887
I'm coming, Papa.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:54.469
Uh-oh.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.983
Your dog made sport of my blood, you pig.

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:04.358
I'm going to kill your kids for that.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:09.614
You come out here
and stick your life in my face.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.955
Stick your fingers in my pie.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.370
That was a bad mistake.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:21.333
I thought you was smart and tough.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.672
- You're stupid.
- Yeah, you sure are.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.920
You're nothing.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:36.095
I'm going to watch your goddamn car
rust out, yes I will.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.892
Right, Father. Tell him.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:44.061
I'll see the wind
blow your dried up seeds away.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:51.159
I'll eat the heart
of your stinking memory.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:54.746
I'll eat the brains of your kids' kids.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.160
I'm in, you're out. Mars?

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.078
Yeah, Papa?

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:04.547
You keep an eye
on that young tenderloin baby.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:07.133
I want nothing happening to her
unless I say so.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.878
You get me, Papa. I'm going with you.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.338
I don't care.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:16.764
Well, you got that cut on your legs,
a blood pipe as big as your thumb.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.727
Good place to cut somebody,
but not so good to get cut there yourself.

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:23.020
Guys!

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:28.738
I got a feeling that tenderloin's daddy
is going to come looking for her.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.200
- You can take care of him then.
- I'll rip his lungs out.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.703
You do that.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:41.702
- You got bullets for that there cannon?
- All loaded, Papa Jupe.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:45.667
It's getting light out.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.790
Let's get started.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.609
Wait for me.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.189
Bobby?

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:55.362
Bobby, you read me?

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.446
Shh! Bobby?

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:05.168
This is a breaker one-niner for KUY-9532.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.339
Mayday, mayday, mayday. Goddamnit, mayday.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.719
This is a breaker KUY-195.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:26.189
Does anybody read this?
This an SOS. Mayday.

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:32.146
This is a breaker one-niner for KUY-9532.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.523
Does anybody read this?

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.900
We need police help.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.992
Mayday. M...

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:42.034
Look, Brenda, will you keep it down?

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.872
Oh, no.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.723
It's pretty quiet.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.766
- Think they're laying for us?
- Wouldn't be surprised.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.517
Hello, police? Air Force?

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:15.238
This is KUY-9532 calling mayday, mayday.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.788
Hello KUY, this is Air Force Rescue.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.124
We have you loud and clear. What's up?

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.290
Thank God.
Hello listen, we're under attack.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:34.587
I don't know who. They killed three of us,
and they kidnapped a baby.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.335
OK, OK. Now hold on.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.967
What are your defensive capabilities
at this time?

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.718
One gun and I only have two bullets left.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.016
We don't have any hunting rifles
or anything.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.856
You've got to help us.
We're sitting ducks.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.475
Stand by.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.978
You've got to tell him where we are.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:59.149
We are recommending
that until we can get to you,

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.367
you stand on your heads.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.237
Stand on our heads? Um, that's code f...

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:07.787
Just stand on your heads
with your thumbs up your ass.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.290
Oh, Bobby.

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:17.585
"What are your defensive
capabilities at this time?"

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:20.211
Ha! They're just sitting ducks.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.385
We'll go in through that wash.
They'll never see us coming.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.906
Mars, we've seen some signs.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.118
You might have a visitor snooping around.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.531
You keep your eyes open.
We're almost there.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.042
Bobby, do you read me?

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:54.792
Bobby?

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.590
They're coming your way.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.381
For Christ's sake, kid, put your ears on.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:03.004
Damnit!

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.764
Come here, fella. Come here.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.102
Listen, it's your turn up at the bat, OK?

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.312
So you go and get them, OK?

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.477
Go, go.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.871
Maybe the real Air Force
will see this and come.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.241
Forget it.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.083
Nobody's gonna help us.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.542
We've got to get out of this ourselves.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:45.471
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, girl,
just sing right out.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:10.493
- How strong is this anyway?
- Plenty, why?

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.615
Come on, I got an idea.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.773
Come here!

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.967
Papa Jupiter!

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.882
Papa Jupiter!

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.928
Papa Jupiter!

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.378
- Mars.
- Did you get them?

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:23.917
Kill the baby.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.135
- Ruby?
- What do you want?

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.548
- Get it out here.
- What?

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.769
- You know what.
- What?

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:41.935
- Just get it out here.
- What's going on?

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:51.066
Don't do it until I'm away.
I don't want to see it.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.745
Ruby!

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.206
Where is she?

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:13.929
Katy!

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.306
Katy!

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.140
Ruby!

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.859
Ruby!

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:38.367
Hey, you! Give me my Katy.

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:43.118
Let's get out of here!

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:52.047
Wait.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:53.795
What?

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.217
We can't do this.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.927
We've got to do it.

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:04.347
It's the only way to be sure.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:35.379
Fucking devil dog. You son of a bitch!

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:38.597
You piece of shit.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.684
I'll kill you bitch. I'll kill you.

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:45.517
I'll eat your heart, piss licker.
Puke eater!

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:49.017
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.345
- Take the baby, here.
- Lift this up.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:42.012
You die, boy!

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.087
Jesus, this guy doesn't quit!

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:42.906
Oh, holy shit!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:47.077
Got yourself trapped
right where they breed, boy!

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.828
Mars! Take me!

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.921
- Get out of here!
- Take me!

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.670
You ain't worth taking, Ruby.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.839
Leave him alone.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.507
Take me.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.381
- Look!
- Ruby!

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.101
Mars!

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.940
Katy!

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.855
Mars!

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.025
Help!

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:29.532
Help!

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.121
Katy!

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.291
No!

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:47.175
You... son of a bitch!

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:14.323
You bastard! You got ten seconds to live.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:16.997
- Ten seconds!
- Please!

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.875
Get off! Get off me!

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.908
Mars!

01:25:12.733 --> 01:25:14.155
Fire it up.

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:20.115
Come on.

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:33.553
Run!

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:49.611
It's working.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.326
Shit!

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:08.877
- Come on.
- He's loose!

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.294
Hurry!

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.513
Hold your nose. Hold your nose.

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.765
Through the window, like I told you!

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:32.362
I'll get you!

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.739
Go on. Run!

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.215
Come on, open the door.

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:00.181
Come on!

01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:20.695
Woo-hoo!

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.459
- Where are you going?
- We've got to be sure.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.294
Bobby, don't!

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:31.413
Bobby, no! Wait, don't!

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:32.960
Bobby, don't!

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:36.297
Bobby, don't leave me! Don't leave me!

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:38.546
Bobby, wait!

01:27:39.942 --> 01:27:41.760
Bobby!

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.137
Bobby, don't go in there!

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.681
Bobby, please don't go in there!

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:48.555
Bobby! No!

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.432
Bobby!

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:22.302
Bobby!
