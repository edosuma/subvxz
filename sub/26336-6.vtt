Cessna 727, Echo, Mike.
Emergency.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.216
Sir, we're getting

from a civilian aircraft.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.659
CIC visually confirms
a Cessna 172.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.791
It's five miles out
and closing.

00:52.835 --> 00:53.879
PILOT:
Situation urgent.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.620
Request permission
to land, over.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.405
He's trying to land
on our flight deck.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.497
This is Tower CVN-68.

Do not approach.
Repeat: do not approach.

This is a United States

[radio static]Cessna 7, Echo, Mike,

01:11.114 --> 01:14.117
turn back now or you will be
considered a threat.

Do you copy?[radio static]

Need to land now.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.489
Sir, we're running out of time.
Waiting for your order.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.059
PILOT:
Please. I need to land.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.495
Clear the deck, now.

STEVE:
Sergeant Duke Lukela.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.995
Thank you, Steve.

03:33.038 --> 03:36.390
We both know if it wasn't
for you, I wouldn't be here.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.782
It's a great pleasure for me

03:37.826 --> 03:40.785
to see you back
in this uniform, Sergeant.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.400
Thank you.Couple people here

03:46.443 --> 03:48.010
want to talk to you, Duke.

Commander McGarrett?

Yes, ma'am?

NCIS Special Agent
Emma Warren.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.844
I'm sorry to chase
you down like this,

03:55.887 --> 03:57.976
but someone from your
headquarters suggested I might

03:58.020 --> 03:59.369
find you here.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.284
No problem, Agent Warren.
What can I do for you?

04:01.328 --> 04:03.895
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.516
Now, we've been piecing together
Mr. Rodes's movements

04:15.559 --> 04:17.909
over the past few days,
and as far as we can tell,

04:17.953 --> 04:21.086
you were the last person
who saw him alive.Yeah, uh...

04:21.130 --> 04:23.306
I-I had drinks with him,

04:23.350 --> 04:26.266
I don't know, two days ago.
He was here on a job, I think.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.441
Did he share
any details with you?

04:27.484 --> 04:28.920
No.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.226
Okay.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.401
[scoffs]

04:33.882 --> 04:36.711
Look, I don't want
to jump to any conclusions,

04:36.754 --> 04:38.843
but when a gun for hire
turns up dead on a plane

04:38.887 --> 04:40.584
with a bullet in him
and a baby on board,

04:40.628 --> 04:43.152
I have to consider
every possibility.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.067
Such as?

04:45.110 --> 04:47.069
Well, that your friend,
Carson Rodes,

04:47.112 --> 04:48.679
may have been involved
in a kidnapping.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.856
Okay.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.032
Let me just be very clear
with you right here.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.297
I was on teams
with this guy.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.168
We were downrange
together two tours.

04:59.211 --> 05:02.650
I know this man; this is a
good man you're talking about.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.740
He may have been a good man,
Commander.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.220
But I can't say the same
for the people he took jobs for.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.832
His last three contracts
were in Venezuela,

05:10.875 --> 05:13.051
Somalia and Bosnia.Yeah.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.488
And for some
pretty sketchy individuals.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.228
Okay. You identify the kid yet?

05:16.272 --> 05:19.057
Identify the kid, all right?
And talk to the parents.

05:19.101 --> 05:22.365
'Cause I guarantee you,
they will clear this up.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.324
Look, I understand
that this is difficult for you.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.065
And I'm gonna do
everything I can

05:27.109 --> 05:28.371
to find out what happened
without jumping

05:28.415 --> 05:30.591
to any conclusions
about your friend.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.070
Okay.I will even
keep you in the loop

05:32.114 --> 05:33.898
as much as possible,
Commander.Thank you.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.901
But in return,
you have to do something for me.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.599
What's that?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.949
Back off and let me do my job.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.037
Got it.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.388
Okay.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.870
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.785
Okay.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.069

06:19.291 --> 06:22.512
Wha-What are you doing here?

06:22.556 --> 06:26.037
[scoffs]
I live here.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.823
What are you doing here?

06:28.866 --> 06:31.347
I was just watering the plants.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.003
You know, like you told me to
while you and Kono were gone?

06:35.046 --> 06:38.267
Remember?[sighs]

06:38.310 --> 06:40.225
[chuckles weakly]

06:48.016 --> 06:50.018
It's over.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.107
What's over?

06:55.545 --> 06:58.243
Kono left me.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.205
[sighs]

07:03.248 --> 07:04.467
What happened?

07:06.730 --> 07:11.082
Well, after all I went through
with Jesse, her death...

07:11.126 --> 07:14.216
that changed me.

07:16.174 --> 07:20.788
When I went back to Kono,
I f-found that she changed, too.

07:20.831 --> 07:25.140
Her job had become
everything to her.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.838
[scoffs]

07:27.882 --> 07:31.233
And there we were.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.364
Two different people,

07:32.408 --> 07:35.759
just trying to pretend
it still worked.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.155
She was just the first
to say it.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.026
That it was over.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.249
I'm so sorry.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.558
Yeah.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.258
I need to lie down.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
CARSON: I thought
that was it for me.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.233
STEVE: No, I knew you'd be
back to fight another day,

08:15.277 --> 08:16.887
but listen, do you remember the
look on that interpreter's face

08:16.931 --> 08:19.629
when that light came on?Yeah. We thought he said

08:19.673 --> 08:21.152
he'd never jumped before;
it turns out he never...

08:21.196 --> 08:22.763
He'd never been in
a plane. Period....been in a plane.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.374
When those doors opened,
he was clawing at me like a cat

08:25.417 --> 08:26.897
trying to get out
of a bath.

08:26.941 --> 08:30.335
That was the most terrifying
tandem jump of my life.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.772
Wasn't that guy
sick all over you?

08:31.815 --> 08:33.904
Twice.Twice, right.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.123
It's good to see you, brother.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.777
You, too, buddy.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.779
Especially when
you pick up the tab.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.607
Which is only fair,
considering how many times

08:40.650 --> 08:42.826
I pulled your chestnuts
out of the fire.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.612
Is that right?
You know, it's funny.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.266
The beer must be especially
strong this afternoon,

08:48.310 --> 08:49.703
'cause I-I'm struggling
to remember

08:49.746 --> 08:51.400
when you pulled anything
of mine...What about Fallujah?

08:51.443 --> 08:53.271
...out of the fire--
Fallujah's a beautiful city.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.925
What about Fallujah?No, no, no, no.
The tape trick.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.927
Who do you think
taught you that?

08:59.060 --> 09:00.104
Son of a bitch.
You taught me

09:00.148 --> 09:01.279
the tape trick.
Yes, sir.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.759
I totally forgot
about that.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.761
You know, I just used that
move recently in Sarajevo.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.502
Oh, you did?Made me think of you.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.895
You know, that is
the sweetest thing

09:07.938 --> 09:08.939
you've ever said to me.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.114
[laughs]You know that?

09:10.158 --> 09:11.942
So, what you're telling me
is that you came

09:11.986 --> 09:13.335
all the way to Honolulu

09:13.378 --> 09:15.250
to tell me how much you
miss me, is that right?

09:15.293 --> 09:17.818
Sure. Something like that.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.602
All right.
Tell me something, brother.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.995
How's life? You living right?

09:21.038 --> 09:23.867
I make good money.Yeah.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.695
I don't always work
for good people,

09:25.739 --> 09:28.002
but, you know, sometimes
you just got to do the job.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.830
Do you?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.222
I'm just saying,
I distinctly remember

09:31.266 --> 09:32.746
making you a job offer
which, uh,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.051
which still stands,
by the way.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.923
Oh, and I appreciate that,
my brother, I do.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.665
But me and law enforcement?
Not a good fit.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.927
Oh, yeah.
Too many rules.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.363
Oh, yeah.Plus, I could never

09:41.406 --> 09:42.625
take orders from you.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.369
Mm. I'll tell you right now,

09:47.412 --> 09:50.024
the only thing I'm ordering
this afternoon is a cab.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.202
Listen, let's not, uh,
let's not wait another six years

09:54.245 --> 09:55.551
before we do this again,
all right?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.944
Yeah.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.685
My man.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.643
Great to see you.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.949
You, too.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.610
â™ª

10:12.002 --> 10:15.005
I'm sorry for your
loss, Commander.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.007
Thank you. Um...

10:17.051 --> 10:20.315
I appreciate you letting me
pay my last respects here.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.883
This may be NCIS's case,
but they can't control

10:22.926 --> 10:24.885
who comes in and out
of my office.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.366
Yeah.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.673
These, um, these
Carson's things?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.806
Yes.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.896
Uh, we know that you can't
let us near that stuff, Noelani.

10:35.939 --> 10:36.984
It's okay.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.378
Oh, uh, actually,
I just remembered

10:40.422 --> 10:42.119
I need to make a phone call.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.253
Um, it's personal,
so I'm gonna take it out there.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.690
It'll take me
about two or three minutes,

10:47.734 --> 10:49.518
and that should be
enough time...

10:49.561 --> 10:51.302
uh, for my phone call.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.261
Thanks, Noelani.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.523
Thank you.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.265
I always liked her.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.875
All right, Carson...

10:58.919 --> 11:01.878
let's see what you had on you
when you boarded this plane.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.669
He was staying
at the Aupani Hotel.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.496
What else?
What do you got?

11:11.540 --> 11:13.368
I got a receipt for...

11:13.411 --> 11:15.022
baby supplies:
diapers, baby wipes...

11:15.065 --> 11:17.502
Look at that:
formula, bottles.I know this place.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.027
It's right by the airport.That was three days ago.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.812
It means he must have got this
right when he got to Oahu.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.119
Okay, so-so if he lands,
the first thing he does

11:25.162 --> 11:28.644
is buy all these supplies--
it means that he did not
just wind up with the baby.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.993
It wasn't an accident.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.430
No. He came here looking for it.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.911
STEVE:
Tani, what do you got

11:34.955 --> 11:36.130
on the baby so far?

11:36.173 --> 11:37.609
Based on the size of the diapers

11:37.653 --> 11:38.915
that Carson bought,

11:38.959 --> 11:41.004
that baby's between two
and three months old.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.484
Also, the formula is dairy-free,

11:42.527 --> 11:44.660
so he or she
must have an allergy.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.010
All right, look, even if that
baby was completely unharmed

11:47.054 --> 11:48.751
after the crash landing,

11:48.795 --> 11:51.754
NCIS would still take it to
a hospital for observation.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.016
Yeah. Joons is there right now

11:53.060 --> 11:55.105
doing the rounds to see
if there's any new admit

11:55.149 --> 11:57.064
that matches the profile,
but no luck so far.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.067
Where are we at
with the missing child reports?I reached out to the FBI,

12:00.110 --> 12:02.243
but nothing as of yet.
You know, it could really help

12:02.286 --> 12:04.941
if we could narrow down
exactly where we're looking.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.204
According to Agent Warren,
Carson was piloting

12:07.248 --> 12:10.120
a single-engine Cessna
with a maximum range

12:10.164 --> 12:11.861
of 600 nautical miles.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.472
Which means Carson and that baby
had to have taken off

12:14.516 --> 12:17.388
from one
of the Hawaiian Islands.Okay. So we need to search

12:17.432 --> 12:19.390
all the islands
for a missing three-month-old.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.783
Joons and I'll get on it.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.263
Steve, it's Jerry.
I've been looking at

12:22.306 --> 12:23.960
where Carson
may have gotten that plane--

12:24.004 --> 12:26.484
local airfields, whatnot--
so far, nothing.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.138
You know what we need?
We need a tail number.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.792
If we had a tail number,

12:29.836 --> 12:31.141
we could go through
flight records

12:31.185 --> 12:32.795
and find out exactly
where Carson took off from.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.015
Can't get a tail number,
'cause NCIS has that
plane in custody.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.451
Yeah, about that,

12:36.494 --> 12:39.106
turns out NCIS does not have
its own hangar on Oahu.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.065
Okay, so maybe they keep it
in one of the HPD impounds.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.111
Jerry, find out which one
and go on a field trip.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.113
Danny and I are gonna go
check out the hotel room

12:46.156 --> 12:47.375
where Carson was staying.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.855
Sir, wherever they're
keeping that plane,

12:48.898 --> 12:50.595
it's gonna be locked up
pretty tight.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.467
Well, you'd better get creative.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.473
â™ª

13:07.264 --> 13:08.657
MAN: Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.876
Yeah, you.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.834
Do I know you?Uh, no, sir.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.836
Name's Chuck.
I'm new here.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.969
Let me see your
credentials.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.147
Oh, darn. I must have
left them in the locker.

13:20.190 --> 13:23.280
Yeah. Look, I don't know how
you got in here, but I know

13:23.324 --> 13:25.195
where you're going.
Come on, come with me.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.370
GROVER:
I'll take it from here.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.198
Agent Parsons, NTSB.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.897
This wouldn't be the
first time I have to throw
this guy out of a hangar.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.550
He's some kind
of an airplane nut.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.205
Get a life, would you, Chuck?
Or at least

13:35.249 --> 13:37.033
stop ruining mine.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.774
Listen, do me a favor,
would you, Chief?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.168
Take this guy over here
and keep an eye on him.
I got to get a car

13:41.211 --> 13:42.430
to take Chucky into custody.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.084
And take off your watch;
he likes those, too.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.737
Yeah, yeah, okay.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.087
Come on.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.094
[whispering indistinctly]

13:54.137 --> 13:57.097
Can I help you,
Agent...?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.663
Parsons,

13:58.707 --> 14:01.536
NTSB, Deputy Division Chief S-R.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.929
I just took a man
into custody.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.279
Little word of caution
for you, ma'am: you might want

14:05.322 --> 14:07.585
to start locking this place down
a little bit better.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.414
You got all kinds of riffraff
in here just wandering about.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.941
[elevator bell dings]

14:14.984 --> 14:17.073
So, did you put the gun back
before you left?

14:17.117 --> 14:18.988
Would you keep
your voice down, please?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.903
Yes, I did.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.297
So, what are you gonna do now?I don't know. That's
why I'm talking to you.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.081
Ideas are welcome.Well, I told you...

14:25.125 --> 14:27.083
Don't do the "I told you" thing.
Please. That's not helping.

14:27.127 --> 14:30.130
Well, I-I did tell you
not to get involved.You did. You told me.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.522
All right?
And maybe I shouldn't have.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.784
Yeah, you
shouldn't have.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.569
But at the end of the day,

14:34.612 --> 14:37.093
you're still a cop, and
you got to follow the law.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.095
The bigger problem,
as I see it, is:

14:39.139 --> 14:41.619
this could blow up your
relationship with McGarrett.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.186
Oh, my...

14:43.230 --> 14:45.319
But maybe there's a way

14:45.362 --> 14:48.104
we can do the right thing
without jeopardizing that.

14:48.148 --> 14:52.065
[sighs]
You're talking about calling in
an anonymous tip to HPD?

14:52.108 --> 14:53.544
It's crossed my mind.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.242
So why haven't you done it?

14:58.332 --> 15:00.421
[elevator bell dings]

15:14.043 --> 15:15.262
[beeps]

15:41.027 --> 15:43.420
â™ª

16:00.307 --> 16:02.309
[camera clicks][door opens]

16:06.095 --> 16:08.619
EMMA:
Really, Commander?

16:08.663 --> 16:09.707
Agent Warren.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.535
This is, uh, this
is a surprise.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.754
Not for us.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.190
We made your partner
downstairs

16:14.234 --> 16:15.887
and came in through the back.

16:15.931 --> 16:19.108
[chuckles softly] Yeah, okay.
I was just leaving anyway.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.284
I said...

16:21.328 --> 16:23.286
let me do my job.Yeah, you did.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.288
And if you were in my
shoes, you would, uh,

16:25.332 --> 16:26.594
you'd have trouble
letting this go, too.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.335
Maybe. And if the roles
were revered,

16:28.378 --> 16:31.555
I'd hope you'd cut me the same
break I'm about to cut you.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.905
What's that?Consider this
a final warning.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.256
As much as I've enjoyed
our first two chats,

16:36.299 --> 16:37.953
I'm hoping there
won't be a third.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.869
Got it.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.089
Oh, and, um,
you didn't happen to find

16:43.132 --> 16:45.352
anything we missed,
did you?

16:45.395 --> 16:49.312
No. No, no, the place
is just as you left it.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.574
Hmm.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.669
We called it
the "tape trick," right?

16:58.713 --> 17:02.456
If either one of us
ever felt like we were
in danger of being grabbed,

17:02.499 --> 17:04.588
we would write something
that identified the threat

17:04.632 --> 17:07.156
on a piece of tape
and stick it somewhere
out of sight:

17:07.200 --> 17:09.550
under the dash of a car,
under some furniture, whatever.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.987
So if somebody disappeared,
there'd be a clue.Right.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.251
And-and Carson brought it up
with me a couple of days ago
when I saw him.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.732
He wanted me to find this in
case something happened to him.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.300
Right. So he left a clue
that there's a clue.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.866
Right. Junior.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.999
You, uh, you run that
plate we sent over?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.741
Uh, yes, sir, and it came back
as a rental from a company

17:26.784 --> 17:28.438
here in Oahu.
The name on the contract

17:28.482 --> 17:31.441
is fake, but there's
a number on there--
it looks like a burner.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.400
I'm trying to ping
its location right now.

17:33.443 --> 17:36.838
Okay, what about the baby,
did we get an I.D. yet?Unfortunately, no,

17:36.881 --> 17:38.840
but we checked records
at every hospital,

17:38.883 --> 17:40.668
statewide,
going back six months.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.800
Okay, so that probably means
the kid is not local.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.151
Guys, that was Jerry.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.674
He and Grover are
on the way back.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.415
They found the Cessna.Okay, so we got
a tail number.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.894
Well, they got
more than that.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.071
The flight records show
that Carson paid cash

17:52.114 --> 17:54.116
to charter a plane on Oahu,
and then he flew

17:54.160 --> 17:55.813
that plane to Lanai
early this morning.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.206
Okay, so he's probably

17:57.250 --> 17:58.425
going to Lanai
to pick up the kid,

17:58.468 --> 17:59.904
and he gets stopped
on his way back,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.297
they make him land.JUNIOR:
Hey, guys,

18:01.341 --> 18:02.385
I got a location on that burner.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.561
STEVE:
Where is it?Lanai.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.433
That was a popular
destination yesterday.All right, so somebody's

18:06.476 --> 18:08.522
tailing Carson on Oahu,
and then whoever it is,

18:08.565 --> 18:10.437
they follow him
all the way to Lanai.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.700
Right. And they're
still there, or their
cell phone's still there.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.311
All right, we're going to Lanai.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.444
Boss, can I
just have a word?Yes.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.882
[quietly]:
Adam's back.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.449
Adam's back?
That's great.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.277
He's not doing so well.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.584
Kono left him, and he's, like,
really not in a good place.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.282
Okay. Uh, oh, my God.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.284
All right. Thanks.
I'll reach out to him.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.155
I appreciate you telling me.
Thank you.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.374
Hey, Steve?Huh?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.593
The, um...

18:37.986 --> 18:39.596
STEVE: Oh, now
you notice her?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.555
That's good work,
Detective. Hi.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.644
Did you really think I wouldn't
find out you took something

18:43.687 --> 18:45.211
from that hotel room?I'm sorry,

18:45.254 --> 18:47.474
I don't know what you...Don't make this
worse by lying.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.520
Again. I dusted the place
as soon as you left.

18:50.564 --> 18:51.869
There was fresh
adhesive residue

18:51.913 --> 18:54.437
on the underside of the
bedside table drawer.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.917
You took something.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.312
About three inches long,
an inch or so wide.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.531
Something like that.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.446
What, that?

19:04.447 --> 19:06.493
Okay, you know what?

19:06.536 --> 19:09.191
You're right, I shouldn't
have done that.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.585
Which one? Crossing the crime
scene tape at the hotel room,

19:11.628 --> 19:14.240
tampering with evidence from
an active investigation,

19:14.283 --> 19:17.417
lying about it,
lying about it again?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.636
All of it. I shouldn't
have done any of it.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.421
I'm sorry, and, uh,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.510
I, uh, I won't
do it again.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.903
Hmm. Well, you won't have
the chance to, Commander...

19:25.947 --> 19:27.949
because I'm placing you
under arrest.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.303
You're serious?

19:34.347 --> 19:37.001
[handcuffs clicking]

19:37.045 --> 19:38.351
Okay.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.093
After you.

DANNY:
Wow. America's Most Wanted.

19:56.543 --> 19:57.631
What's going on?Hey, Danny. What's up?

19:57.674 --> 19:58.545
You know, I didn't think
your girlfriend

19:58.588 --> 20:00.024
was gonna give you a phone call.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.678
Ha. That's, uh,
that's a good one.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.420
You're, uh, you're on speaker
with the two of us in here, bud.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.031
Okay. Lead with that next time.
Anyway, uh, sit tight.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.990
I'm on my way
to the governor right now

20:09.033 --> 20:10.861
to get your official letter
of release.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.211
Oh, that's great news.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.691
Listen, there's something
I need you to do first.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.653
[grunting]

20:19.696 --> 20:20.871
[groans]

20:21.785 --> 20:23.352
Danny?Yeah.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.617
What are you doing here, man?I'm breathing
through my mouth.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.358
You're very ripe.
Drink this.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.578

Sorry about
the, uh...

the water.[mutters]

20:38.715 --> 20:40.935
[breathing deeply]

20:42.806 --> 20:44.895
Tani told you.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.288
Yeah, yeah, she, uh,

20:46.332 --> 20:47.768
she told me, she
told McGarrett,

20:47.811 --> 20:49.552
she told everybody else.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.771
[exhales]

20:50.814 --> 20:53.861
So I'm guessing
you drew the short straw?

20:53.904 --> 20:56.342
No. Uh, Steve
would be here, too,

20:56.385 --> 20:57.691
except he's, uh,

20:57.734 --> 21:00.041
he's tied up, literally.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.565
But I'm glad that I'm here
to talk to you, buddy.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.133
You look terrible.
Listen to me, I, um...

21:05.176 --> 21:07.309
I-I know what you're
going through right now.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.529
I-I know how you feel.
I've been there, too.

21:09.572 --> 21:12.575
Okay. Uh, when Rachel
and I broke up,

21:12.619 --> 21:15.665
I was... I was
in bad shape.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.451
I was sick.
I couldn't eat.
I didn't sleep.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.148
I was a mess.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.890
But I promise you,
I promise you
it gets better.

21:22.933 --> 21:27.242
It will pass.
It will get...Danny, Danny, uh...

21:27.286 --> 21:30.680
I appreciate that
McGarrett asked you to...

21:30.724 --> 21:33.292
come give me this pep talk,
but I'm... I-I got...

21:33.335 --> 21:35.032
I'm okay.You're okay?

21:35.076 --> 21:38.079
First of all, uh, Steve
doesn't ask anybody
to do anything.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.777
The pep talk's from me.
The-the invitation,

21:40.821 --> 21:43.258
on the other hand,
that-that's from Steve.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.043
Invitation? To what?

21:46.087 --> 21:48.742
To, uh, to join us,
to join the team.

21:48.785 --> 21:51.179
Five-O, the badge,
gun, the whole trip.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.789
[chuckles]

21:52.833 --> 21:54.791
You're-you're kidding,
right?

21:54.835 --> 21:55.705
Mm-mm.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.273
But, Danny,
I'm-I'm not a cop.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.883
So what?

21:59.927 --> 22:01.320
I mean, you've done the job.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.583
You've helped us out
more times than I can remember.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.280
This is not a
handout, by the way.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.369
This is not 'cause
you look horrible.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.806
It's because we actually
believe in you.You're serious?

22:09.850 --> 22:12.592
Absolutely, yeah. I mean,
take your time, think about it.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.377
I don't need to.

22:15.421 --> 22:18.032
Mahalo, Danny.Okay. All right.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.990
Mahalo.Okay. Buddy, you smell

22:20.034 --> 22:22.515
so bad. I love you,
but you stink really bad.[laughs]

22:22.558 --> 22:24.691
Thank you.Yeah, of course. Go
take a shower, okay?

22:24.734 --> 22:27.476
All right, stop touching me.
I love you, too, all right?

22:34.396 --> 22:37.225
Nothing ever good happens
in a place this remote.

22:37.268 --> 22:40.271
Least not for these three.Four.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.908
Baby was definitely here.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.172
Place looks like the Alamo.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.000
Fact that the kid
is even still alive

23:13.043 --> 23:15.045
must be some kind
of a miracle.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.134
Looks like someone was
squatting down with him here.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.049
Maybe all these dead shooters

23:19.093 --> 23:20.921
were just here trying to
protect the little guy.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.401
Well, it seems like
a lot of muscle

23:22.444 --> 23:24.446
just to protect one kid.Not if you think

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
a Navy SEAL's coming after you.So you think
that's what his tail

23:26.709 --> 23:27.754
on Oahu was about?

23:27.797 --> 23:29.538
Could be.

23:29.582 --> 23:33.586
Lou, you think McGarrett's
friend spilled all this blood?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.549
[knock on door]

23:40.593 --> 23:42.899
This is great.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.771
This is the...
This is fantastic.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.163
It's so good here.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.296
Can I... can I post this
on my Instagram account?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.167
I don't even have an Instagram
account. I'm gonna make one

23:50.211 --> 23:52.213
and-and make this,
like, my profile pic,

23:52.256 --> 23:53.475
here with the cuffs
and everything.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.824
That's good. That's good.
That's funny.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.391
How's Adam?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.219
Adam is, uh... He's miserable.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.787
Uh, but he's gonna be all right.
He's happy about the badge.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.702
He's in? That's great.
That's excellent.Mm-hmm. Yeah.

24:02.745 --> 24:06.096
Can I help you?Hi. Yeah.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.924
Detective Danny Williams.
We didn't officially meet.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.926
No? Okay.

24:09.970 --> 24:10.840
I want to thank you for this.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.668
This lunatic being

24:12.712 --> 24:14.496
behind bars finally.Honestly,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.411
it's a conference room.Can I have this moment, please?

24:16.455 --> 24:17.630
Yes, you may.I'm gonna send you

24:17.673 --> 24:18.892
a nice Edible Arrangement.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.589
It's gonna be lovely.
But, unfortunately,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.939
all good things come to
an end. There you go.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.424
[Emma scoffs]

24:31.470 --> 24:34.429
Not everyone
has immunity and means.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.736
Right.I have to work this case clean,

24:36.779 --> 24:38.868
and if you keep jeopardizing
my ability to do that,

24:38.912 --> 24:40.783
we're gonna have
an actual problem.

24:40.827 --> 24:44.221
One that the governor
can't fix.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.921
So, I spoke to Tani and
Grover over on Lanai

24:47.964 --> 24:49.836
about two secs before I
walked into your cell here.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.881
Still a conference room.Whatever.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.753
Uh, there were
bodies. Five bodies.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.755
Uh, all shooters.
Complete bloodbath.

24:55.798 --> 24:59.149
It looked like the baby had
been there for a while, too.

24:59.193 --> 25:02.109
Steve? Hey, Steve? What...?

25:09.159 --> 25:11.118
STEVE:
Hey. So, Five-O

25:11.161 --> 25:13.163
found the crime scene
where Carson was shot.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.731
There's two of our
team there right now.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.429
I see. You just like to fight.No.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.301
I'm just saying there's
five dead bodies there.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.346
Okay? Now, you can slap the
cuffs on me again if you like.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.435
Him, too, for that matter.Don't-don't volunteer me

25:24.479 --> 25:26.133
for the conference room, okay?Now it's a conference room?

25:26.176 --> 25:27.743
All right?
Or you can accept the fact

25:27.787 --> 25:30.746
that you wouldn't have this
break if it wasn't for Five-O.

25:30.790 --> 25:31.965
Okay? And we can
work together

25:32.008 --> 25:33.706
from here on out.
It's your call.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.756
TANI:
Maui County PD

25:40.800 --> 25:42.149
just started processing
the scene.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.107
We already have an I.D.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.545
from one of the dead shooters
that we found in the house.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.024
He was already in the system

25:48.068 --> 25:49.765
for multiple violent offenses.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.767
Name's Kalino Hale.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.250
DANNY:
That's good.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.904
Couple B and E's,
aggravated assault.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.949
Not my first choice
for a babysitter.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.560
Let me ask you
guys a question.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.998
If the baby is with a felon
like Hale, maybe Carson was here

26:05.041 --> 26:07.870
to rescue the kid, right?
Not abduct him.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
It's starting
to look that way, yeah.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.221
Hey, I just hit pay dirt in the
house. Who is that, McGarrett?

26:11.265 --> 26:12.962
STEVE: Hey, man, listen, there's
somebody I want you to meet.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.878
Captain Lou Grover, meet NCIS
Special Agent Emma Warren.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.054
EMMA:
Actually, we've met.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.753
Apparently Captain Grover
moonlights for NTSB.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.145
Yeah, I like
to keep myself busy.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.147
Anyway, I found some luggage
under the bed.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.758
Still had the baggage claim
sticker on.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.064
The information on that sticker

26:28.108 --> 26:30.937
says a Julia Berg flew
into Honolulu eight days ago

26:30.980 --> 26:32.808
on Flight 981 from Minneapolis.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.681
I'll pull up footage
from the arrival gate.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.682
TANI:
I'm assuming we're thinking

26:36.725 --> 26:38.422
Julia's the baby's mother?

26:38.466 --> 26:40.076
STEVE:
Looks that way.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.425
DANNY: That must be her.STEVE:
All right.

26:41.469 --> 26:42.905
So, what else are we
thinking? Julia comes

26:42.949 --> 26:44.646
to Oahu with the baby...

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
what, for a little R&R?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.476
Gets herself crossed up
with the wrong people

26:48.519 --> 26:51.000
and then gets kidnapped
by Hale, his group of thugs.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.873
Hold on. I found footage
from the baggage claim.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.614
This doesn't look
like a kidnapping.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.096
STEVE:
Looks like a reunion.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.445
So it wasn't a vacation.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.317
Julia travels
all the way to Oahu

27:03.360 --> 27:04.710
to meet up with Hale.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.059
JUNIOR: Then somebody
hires Carson

27:06.102 --> 27:08.365
to track her down
and bring mom and baby back.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.280
Right, somebody.
I'm guessing that's the father.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.673
JERRY: Public
records show Julia

27:11.717 --> 27:14.937
married to a Lee Berg.
Big philanthropist.

27:14.981 --> 27:18.027
Launched a couple
tech start-ups.STEVE: All right.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.638
We got to find this
guy and talk to him.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.685
Where is he?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.818
Where's my son?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
[chuckles, sniffles]

27:31.693 --> 27:32.999
I thought
I'd never see you again.

27:38.439 --> 27:41.616
Eight days ago,
Julia took off with the baby.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.097
I hired Carson
to bring them home safe.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.664
I got a call from him.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.666
He said, uh,
he tracked them to Lanai.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.016
I, uh, jump on
a plane to Oahu.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.018
I was supposed to hang tight
until I heard from him,

27:52.061 --> 27:53.846
but, you know,
the call never came.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.456
EMMA: Can you think
of any reason why your wife

27:55.499 --> 27:57.414
would have taken off
with your child?

27:57.458 --> 27:58.633
She's not well.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.635
It started, uh,

28:00.679 --> 28:01.810
you know, after the baby came.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.333
I thought it was
postpartum depression,

28:03.377 --> 28:05.553
but, um, it just spiraled.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.077
She stopped eating.
She started having delusions.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.384
Then one day she just...

28:10.427 --> 28:12.865
she was just gone.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.997
I pray you find her.
She needs help.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.912
EMMA:
Of course. We're doing

28:16.956 --> 28:18.827
everything we can.Mr. Berg,

28:18.871 --> 28:21.221
do you have any idea
how your wife knew Kalino Hale?

28:21.264 --> 28:24.441
They've known each other long
before I came into the picture.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.966
They dated, I guess,
for about a year

28:27.009 --> 28:28.707
when Julia did
Teach For America

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
in Waialua.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
I don't know,
she always liked bad boys.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.842
You know, that's one thing,

28:33.886 --> 28:36.062
but the taking off with our
child, that's-that's another.

28:36.105 --> 28:40.022
Listen, there was
a bunch of other dead bodies

28:40.066 --> 28:42.851
in that house on Lanai.[scoffs]

28:42.895 --> 28:45.114
You wouldn't happen to know
who they were, would you?

28:45.158 --> 28:48.161
I... No. I don't know.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.206
Maybe friends of Kalino's.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.078
Man, if it really was
that dangerous out there,

28:52.121 --> 28:54.080
Carson really is a hero.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.779
I can't wait to bring him home.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.128
EMMA:
Of course.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.696
But this is an ongoing
criminal investigation,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.654
so we appreciate
your understanding

29:03.698 --> 29:05.831
and your patience.Which means, uh,

29:05.874 --> 29:07.006
till we wrap this up,
we're gonna have

29:07.049 --> 29:08.224
to ask you
not to leave the island.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.270
Leave the island?

29:10.313 --> 29:11.967
No, I'm not leaving
the hospital.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.969
You do whatever you need to do.
I'm gonna stay right here.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.841
Okay.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.889
[indistinct chatter over P.A.]

29:22.935 --> 29:25.198
The guy's lying
through his teeth.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.200
What?He's lying.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.028
He just confirmed
everything you've been saying

29:29.071 --> 29:33.032
about your friend
this whole time.My friend was a SEAL, okay?

29:33.075 --> 29:35.077
I don't have to explain to you
what that means.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.905
Carson would have scoped
that house on Lanai out

29:36.949 --> 29:39.734
from top to bottom.
He's a special operator.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.258
He's not gonna walk into a house
up against five armed guys

29:42.302 --> 29:43.869
by himself. No way.No.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.305
He's brave, not suicidal.

29:45.348 --> 29:46.741
And he could've reached out
to Berg with an update.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.874
He could have
reached out to you.But he didn't.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.527
So if Berg's lying about Carson,

29:50.571 --> 29:52.051
he could be lying
about everything.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.836
There is one person we
haven't spoken to, all right?

29:54.880 --> 29:57.056
And I really believe if we want
to get to the truth in all this,

29:57.099 --> 29:59.101
we have to talk to
this kid's mother.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.958
[knock on door]

30:38.924 --> 30:40.708
Duke.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.145
What's going on?I'm sorry

30:43.189 --> 30:45.800
to have to do this, but HPD
received an anonymous tip.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.715
About what?

30:47.758 --> 30:49.891
A murder investigation.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.458
We need to search your house.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.377
Let's go, guys.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.265
EMMA:
All right, look,

31:16.309 --> 31:17.614
we need to expand the search
for a Julia Berg.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.355
She may not be at any
local hospitals or clinics,

31:19.399 --> 31:20.879
but the way the bullets
were flying at that house,

31:20.922 --> 31:22.315
odds are good
she would've caught one.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.926
Let's look at private
ambulance companies...

31:24.970 --> 31:26.536
Veterinary clinics.Shh.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.408
No, if she's captive
or in hiding, she may...Shh.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.322
...be trying to get her
treatment off the grid.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.324
Okay, good.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.369
Tell him. Tell him. Tell him.Yeah. No, no, he heard you.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.415
He heard you. All right,
Agent Vernon, thank you.Okay, good.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.417
Keep me posted.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.593
I'm starting to understand
why your partner was so happy

31:39.636 --> 31:42.378
to see you cuffed
to a table.
Excuse me?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.684
The interrupting.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.165
Do you do that all the time?Interrupting? I...

31:46.208 --> 31:48.254
'Cause it's incredibly annoying.
There it is again.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.820
I wasn't interrupting.
I was contributing.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.474
Oh, really?It's a... Is this
not a joint inves...

31:51.518 --> 31:53.172
I'm sorry, I thought it
was a joint investigation.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.304
Or is my only
contribution the driving?

31:55.348 --> 31:58.046
I'm just saying, 30-second
phone call, four interruptions.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.961
[phone ringing]Oh, check you out

32:00.005 --> 32:02.398
with your ever-growing list of
talents. I can now add math.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.792
Oh, yeah?
What else is on that list?

32:04.835 --> 32:06.794
Jerry, what do you got?JERRY [over phone]:
Commander,

32:06.837 --> 32:08.578
ballistics came back from Lanai,

32:08.622 --> 32:10.580
and it paints a very different
picture of our shootout.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.191
We've been working
under the assumption

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
that Carson super-soldiered
his way through the property,

32:14.584 --> 32:16.151
taking out Kalino
and his friends.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.500
Okay. But what,

32:17.544 --> 32:18.849
it didn't happen like that?

32:18.893 --> 32:20.112
JERRY:
Not exactly.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.070
Combined with the ballistics
that NCIS

32:22.114 --> 32:23.637
so graciously shared with us,

32:23.680 --> 32:26.553
we now know that Carson's gun
shot everyone except Hale.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.555
And Hale and Carson

32:28.598 --> 32:29.686
were both killed
by the other shooters.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.166
STEVE:
Hold on a minute.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.299
If these other guys weren't
friends of Kalino Hale,

32:33.342 --> 32:35.562
who the hell were they, and
what were they doing there?

32:35.605 --> 32:36.824
JERRY:
Not sure.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.391
But Maui County M.E.'s office
I.D.'d them,

32:38.434 --> 32:40.393
and it seems that they're
all on the payroll

32:40.436 --> 32:42.743
of Kent International,
a private security company

32:42.786 --> 32:45.311
on Oahu.I know that guy.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.139
I know Phil Kent. This
guy's entire operation's

32:47.182 --> 32:49.141
nothing but a bunch
of glorified bouncers.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.620
It's like, he's, like,
the one-stop shop

32:50.664 --> 32:52.448
if you want to hire shady
muscle on the island.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.015
Okay.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.799
So, question is,
who hired them?

32:55.843 --> 32:58.193
Jerry, you got an
address for Kent?

32:58.237 --> 32:59.629
Texting it to you now.

Move in.

33:32.836 --> 33:33.707
[shouts]

34:05.782 --> 34:07.219
That's Kent.

34:07.262 --> 34:09.743
So much for asking
who hired him.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.788
JUNIOR:
Commander.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.722
You're okay. You're all right.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.115
I got you.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.551
JUNIOR: I'll call
an ambulance.

34:35.595 --> 34:36.813
STEVE:
Thank you.

34:36.857 --> 34:39.164
Where's my baby?
[cries]

34:39.207 --> 34:40.600
Where is he?Branden's okay.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.514
He's okay.

34:41.557 --> 34:42.819
[crying]

34:42.863 --> 34:45.561
Julia, your son is healthy
and well cared for

34:45.605 --> 34:46.562
at King's Hospital.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.651
You'll be with
him very soon.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.784
[cries]
Thank you.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.351
You're safe now.

34:52.394 --> 34:55.745
My name is Emma, Emma
Warren. I'm with NCIS.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.617
This is Steve McGarrett
and Danny Williams

34:57.660 --> 34:58.705
from the Five-O
Task Force.

34:58.748 --> 35:01.621
Um... St-Steve McGarrett?

35:01.664 --> 35:02.796
Yeah.Carson told me
to find you

35:02.839 --> 35:04.493
if I ever made it out of there.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.800
Well, you found me, okay?

35:06.843 --> 35:08.802
I'm gonna take a look
at this wound.

35:08.845 --> 35:09.846
Is that all right?

35:09.890 --> 35:11.718
Yeah.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.895
[groans, panting]Listen to me. Hey, hey.
I know it hurts.

35:14.938 --> 35:17.071
There's an ambulance
on the way, okay?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.681
Where's Carson?

35:18.725 --> 35:21.423
Is he in the
hospital, too?

35:22.468 --> 35:24.296
Carson didn't make it.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.084
I knew he was hurt.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.913
I didn't realize how bad.

35:32.956 --> 35:36.090
What happened in that house
on Lanai, Julia?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.266
I was hiding there with Kalino.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.095
We were waiting on new passports
when Carson showed up.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.184
Passports.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.925
Where were
you guys headed?

35:44.968 --> 35:47.536
As far away from my husband Lee
as possible.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.624
[knocking]

35:48.668 --> 35:49.886
Kalino, don't answer it.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.541
Carson took Kalino's gun.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.934
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

35:53.977 --> 35:58.199
Said he was gonna take me
and Branden home.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
I said the only way
that was gonna happen is

36:00.201 --> 36:01.594
if he took us there
in body bags.

36:03.552 --> 36:06.686
Lee beat me.

36:06.729 --> 36:09.776
For years.

36:09.819 --> 36:11.343
I knew that everything
he did to me,

36:11.386 --> 36:13.214
eventually, he would do
to our child.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.783
I couldn't let that happen.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.220
Ever.

36:19.264 --> 36:23.006
Carson believed me.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.445
He said he was gonna get us to safety, throw Lee off my trail.

36:26.488 --> 36:29.230
But that's when
the shooting started.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.363
[gunfire]

36:35.715 --> 36:38.674
â™ª

36:41.677 --> 36:44.506
Carson and Kalino
tried to hold them off,

36:44.550 --> 36:46.900
but they took Kalino down.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.426
[shouts] Then I got shot.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.212
I ran to the back bedroom
with Branden.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.171
I think Carson was able to kill a bunch of them,

36:57.215 --> 36:58.781
but they just kept coming.

36:58.825 --> 36:59.869
[shouts]

36:59.913 --> 37:02.089
He was shot, but he managed

37:02.132 --> 37:04.134
to get back to us.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.788
He barricaded us in.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.747
I knew I didn't have

37:07.790 --> 37:09.749
the strength to make it out
of there,

37:09.792 --> 37:11.272
so I did what any mother
would do.

37:11.316 --> 37:14.580
I begged him
to take my son to safety.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.246
STEVE:
Your husband knew

37:28.289 --> 37:29.682
he couldn't
count on Carson.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.598
He knew that any man
worth his salt

37:32.641 --> 37:34.295
would hear your story
and refuse to bring you home.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.603
Lee was covering
his bases.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.953
Hired Carson to track you down

37:39.996 --> 37:42.172
and the goons to make sure
he got the baby back.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.827
EMMA: We have to
arrest him. Now.[phone beeps]

37:44.871 --> 37:46.264
I'll have HPD hold him
at the hospital.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.613
Wait, Lee's at the hospital?

37:48.788 --> 37:51.356
You didn't let him
near my baby, did you?

37:51.399 --> 37:53.140
Please,

37:53.183 --> 37:55.142
tell me you didn't let him
anywhere near my baby.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.107
Excuse me! Stop!

38:04.151 --> 38:06.327
Hey, you! Stop!

38:30.177 --> 38:31.961
Junior, put out an APB
and alert the TSA.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.963
All right? Lee Berg
does not leave this island.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.138
He has a plane.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.879
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
A plane? What plane?

38:36.923 --> 38:39.186
It belongs to the company.
It's how he'll be traveling.

38:44.974 --> 38:45.932
Hey, Jerry, you find that plane?

38:45.975 --> 38:47.934
FAA records have it located

38:47.977 --> 38:50.371
at a small private airfield
in Makiki.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.546
We're close.

38:51.590 --> 38:52.373
From your position, six minutes.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.722
We'll be there in three.

Lee Berg!

about that kid,

don't do this.
Hand him over, all right?

No, no, no.

As long as I've got him,
you won't take the shot.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.413
They won't, but I will.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.241
Give me Branden now.

Hi.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.975
Hey, little guy.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.673
I missed you.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.819
Well, that was...

40:30.863 --> 40:32.647
interesting.Wha...?

40:32.691 --> 40:35.563
Would you please just admit
that you had a good time?

40:35.607 --> 40:36.999
Please. Just once.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.436
As much as you did.

Sure.

40:45.138 --> 40:46.487
No. No, no, no.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.185
You arrest a man
who solves your case--

40:49.229 --> 40:51.100
the least you can do
is buy me a drink.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.103
Deal.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.148
Good.

40:59.544 --> 41:00.588
[sighs]

41:00.632 --> 41:02.982
I'm thinking,
uh, Pali Bar?

41:03.025 --> 41:04.157
Oh. Yeah.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.506
You would like that place.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.508
No, we're going to O'Connors.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.684
Halfway across the island
at rush hour.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.207
You're a genius. After you.

41:12.557 --> 41:15.124
I knew I should've left
you cuffed to that table.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.996
Not too late.

Hey, it's me. You got a sec?

41:22.697 --> 41:23.872
Yeah. What's up?

41:23.916 --> 41:25.570
I got a call from a buddy
on the force.

41:25.613 --> 41:28.442
Says HPD got a search warrant
on Adam's house,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.009
only, they didn't find anything.

41:32.098 --> 41:35.057
The gun wasn't there?

41:35.101 --> 41:37.059
Are you sure?Yeah, that's what he said.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.105
You did tell me
you put it back, right?

41:39.148 --> 41:41.150
Yeah.

41:44.676 --> 41:47.635
I got to go.

[phone beeps]

41:53.902 --> 41:55.034
Hi.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.862
Hey, Tani.
You got a minute?

41:56.905 --> 41:59.299
Yeah.

41:59.342 --> 42:01.606
What can I do for you?

42:01.649 --> 42:03.825
I think you've
already done enough.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.351
Why'd you put that
in my house?

42:08.395 --> 42:10.397
I didn't, Adam.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.313
I found it there
when you were away.

42:13.356 --> 42:15.489
You're telling me
it's sheer coincidence

42:15.533 --> 42:18.492
that a gun I've never seen
before turns up in my drawer

42:18.536 --> 42:20.276
right after you've been there

42:20.320 --> 42:21.364
and then,
three hours later,

42:21.408 --> 42:23.758
HPD shows up
with a search warrant?

42:27.283 --> 42:29.416
All right,
I know how this looks.

42:29.459 --> 42:30.635
Yeah.I-I will admit that,

42:30.678 --> 42:32.071
when I first found that gun,

42:32.114 --> 42:33.986
my first thought
was I should turn you in.

42:37.337 --> 42:40.209
But after everything we've
been through, I-I couldn't.

42:41.254 --> 42:43.604
So you didn't call HPD?

42:43.648 --> 42:46.302
Adam, you saved
my brother's life.

42:46.346 --> 42:49.088
That means more to me than
anything you might have done.

42:54.310 --> 42:56.269
Okay.

42:56.312 --> 42:58.750
But if you didn't plant the gun

42:58.793 --> 43:01.274
and you didn't tip the cops,

43:01.317 --> 43:03.493
who the hell did?
