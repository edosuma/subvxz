22:15.421 --> 22:18.032
Mahalo, Danny.Okay. All right.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.990
Mahalo.Okay. Buddy, you smell

22:20.034 --> 22:22.515
so bad. I love you,
but you stink really bad.[laughs]

22:22.558 --> 22:24.691
Thank you.Yeah, of course. Go
take a shower, okay?

22:24.734 --> 22:27.476
All right, stop touching me.
I love you, too, all right?

22:34.396 --> 22:37.225
Nothing ever good happens
in a place this remote.

22:37.268 --> 22:40.271
Least not for these three.Four.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.908
Baby was definitely here.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.172
Place looks like the Alamo.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.000
Fact that the kid
is even still alive

23:13.043 --> 23:15.045
must be some kind
of a miracle.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.134
Looks like someone was
squatting down with him here.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.049
Maybe all these dead shooters

23:19.093 --> 23:20.921
were just here trying to
protect the little guy.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.401
Well, it seems like
a lot of muscle

23:22.444 --> 23:24.446
just to protect one kid.Not if you think

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
a Navy SEAL's coming after you.So you think
that's what his tail

23:26.709 --> 23:27.754
on Oahu was about?

23:27.797 --> 23:29.538
Could be.

23:29.582 --> 23:33.586
Lou, you think McGarrett's
friend spilled all this blood?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.549
[knock on door]

23:40.593 --> 23:42.899
This is great.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.771
This is the...
This is fantastic.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.163
It's so good here.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.296
Can I... can I post this
on my Instagram account?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.167
I don't even have an Instagram
account. I'm gonna make one

23:50.211 --> 23:52.213
and-and make this,
like, my profile pic,

23:52.256 --> 23:53.475
here with the cuffs
and everything.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.824
That's good. That's good.
That's funny.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.391
How's Adam?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.219
Adam is, uh... He's miserable.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.787
Uh, but he's gonna be all right.
He's happy about the badge.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.702
He's in? That's great.
That's excellent.Mm-hmm. Yeah.

24:02.745 --> 24:06.096
Can I help you?Hi. Yeah.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.924
Detective Danny Williams.
We didn't officially meet.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.926
No? Okay.

24:09.970 --> 24:10.840
I want to thank you for this.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.668
This lunatic being

24:12.712 --> 24:14.496
behind bars finally.Honestly,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.411
it's a conference room.Can I have this moment, please?

24:16.455 --> 24:17.630
Yes, you may.I'm gonna send you

24:17.673 --> 24:18.892
a nice Edible Arrangement.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.589
It's gonna be lovely.
But, unfortunately,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.939
all good things come to
an end. There you go.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.424
[Emma scoffs]

24:31.470 --> 24:34.429
Not everyone
has immunity and means.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.736
Right.I have to work this case clean,

24:36.779 --> 24:38.868
and if you keep jeopardizing
my ability to do that,

24:38.912 --> 24:40.783
we're gonna have
an actual problem.

24:40.827 --> 24:44.221
One that the governor
can't fix.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.921
So, I spoke to Tani and
Grover over on Lanai

24:47.964 --> 24:49.836
about two secs before I
walked into your cell here.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.881
Still a conference room.Whatever.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.753
Uh, there were
bodies. Five bodies.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.755
Uh, all shooters.
Complete bloodbath.

24:55.798 --> 24:59.149
It looked like the baby had
been there for a while, too.

24:59.193 --> 25:02.109
Steve? Hey, Steve? What...?

25:09.159 --> 25:11.118
STEVE:
Hey. So, Five-O

25:11.161 --> 25:13.163
found the crime scene
where Carson was shot.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.731
There's two of our
team there right now.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.429
I see. You just like to fight.No.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.301
I'm just saying there's
five dead bodies there.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.346
Okay? Now, you can slap the
cuffs on me again if you like.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.435
Him, too, for that matter.Don't-don't volunteer me

25:24.479 --> 25:26.133
for the conference room, okay?Now it's a conference room?

25:26.176 --> 25:27.743
All right?
Or you can accept the fact

25:27.787 --> 25:30.746
that you wouldn't have this
break if it wasn't for Five-O.

25:30.790 --> 25:31.965
Okay? And we can
work together

25:32.008 --> 25:33.706
from here on out.
It's your call.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.756
TANI:
Maui County PD

25:40.800 --> 25:42.149
just started processing
the scene.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.107
We already have an I.D.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.545
from one of the dead shooters
that we found in the house.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.024
He was already in the system

25:48.068 --> 25:49.765
for multiple violent offenses.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.767
Name's Kalino Hale.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.250
DANNY:
That's good.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.904
Couple B and E's,
aggravated assault.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.949
Not my first choice
for a babysitter.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.560
Let me ask you
guys a question.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.998
If the baby is with a felon
like Hale, maybe Carson was here

26:05.041 --> 26:07.870
to rescue the kid, right?
Not abduct him.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
It's starting
to look that way, yeah.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.221
Hey, I just hit pay dirt in the
house. Who is that, McGarrett?

26:11.265 --> 26:12.962
STEVE: Hey, man, listen, there's
somebody I want you to meet.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.878
Captain Lou Grover, meet NCIS
Special Agent Emma Warren.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.054
EMMA:
Actually, we've met.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.753
Apparently Captain Grover
moonlights for NTSB.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.145
Yeah, I like
to keep myself busy.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.147
Anyway, I found some luggage
under the bed.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.758
Still had the baggage claim
sticker on.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.064
The information on that sticker

26:28.108 --> 26:30.937
says a Julia Berg flew
into Honolulu eight days ago

26:30.980 --> 26:32.808
on Flight 981 from Minneapolis.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.681
I'll pull up footage
from the arrival gate.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.682
TANI:
I'm assuming we're thinking

26:36.725 --> 26:38.422
Julia's the baby's mother?

26:38.466 --> 26:40.076
STEVE:
Looks that way.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.425
DANNY: That must be her.STEVE:
All right.

26:41.469 --> 26:42.905
So, what else are we
thinking? Julia comes

26:42.949 --> 26:44.646
to Oahu with the baby...

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
what, for a little R&R?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.476
Gets herself crossed up
with the wrong people

26:48.519 --> 26:51.000
and then gets kidnapped
by Hale, his group of thugs.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.873
Hold on. I found footage
from the baggage claim.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.614
This doesn't look
like a kidnapping.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.096
STEVE:
Looks like a reunion.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.445
So it wasn't a vacation.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.317
Julia travels
all the way to Oahu

27:03.360 --> 27:04.710
to meet up with Hale.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.059
JUNIOR: Then somebody
hires Carson

27:06.102 --> 27:08.365
to track her down
and bring mom and baby back.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.280
Right, somebody.
I'm guessing that's the father.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.673
JERRY: Public
records show Julia

27:11.717 --> 27:14.937
married to a Lee Berg.
Big philanthropist.

27:14.981 --> 27:18.027
Launched a couple
tech start-ups.STEVE: All right.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.638
We got to find this
guy and talk to him.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.685
Where is he?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.818
Where's my son?

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
[chuckles, sniffles]

27:31.693 --> 27:32.999
I thought
I'd never see you again.

27:38.439 --> 27:41.616
Eight days ago,
Julia took off with the baby.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.097
I hired Carson
to bring them home safe.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.664
I got a call from him.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.666
He said, uh,
he tracked them to Lanai.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.016
I, uh, jump on
a plane to Oahu.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.018
I was supposed to hang tight
until I heard from him,

27:52.061 --> 27:53.846
but, you know,
the call never came.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.456
EMMA: Can you think
of any reason why your wife

27:55.499 --> 27:57.414
would have taken off
with your child?

27:57.458 --> 27:58.633
She's not well.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.635
It started, uh,

28:00.679 --> 28:01.810
you know, after the baby came.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.333
I thought it was
postpartum depression,

28:03.377 --> 28:05.553
but, um, it just spiraled.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.077
She stopped eating.
She started having delusions.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.384
Then one day she just...

28:10.427 --> 28:12.865
she was just gone.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.997
I pray you find her.
She needs help.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.912
EMMA:
Of course. We're doing

28:16.956 --> 28:18.827
everything we can.Mr. Berg,

28:18.871 --> 28:21.221
do you have any idea
how your wife knew Kalino Hale?

28:21.264 --> 28:24.441
They've known each other long
before I came into the picture.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.966
They dated, I guess,
for about a year

28:27.009 --> 28:28.707
when Julia did
Teach For America

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
in Waialua.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
I don't know,
she always liked bad boys.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.842
You know, that's one thing,

28:33.886 --> 28:36.062
but the taking off with our
child, that's-that's another.

28:36.105 --> 28:40.022
Listen, there was
a bunch of other dead bodies

28:40.066 --> 28:42.851
in that house on Lanai.[scoffs]

28:42.895 --> 28:45.114
You wouldn't happen to know
who they were, would you?

28:45.158 --> 28:48.161
I... No. I don't know.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.206
Maybe friends of Kalino's.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.078
Man, if it really was
that dangerous out there,

28:52.121 --> 28:54.080
Carson really is a hero.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.779
I can't wait to bring him home.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.128
EMMA:
Of course.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.696
But this is an ongoing
criminal investigation,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.654
so we appreciate
your understanding

29:03.698 --> 29:05.831
and your patience.Which means, uh,

29:05.874 --> 29:07.006
till we wrap this up,
we're gonna have

29:07.049 --> 29:08.224
to ask you
not to leave the island.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.270
Leave the island?

29:10.313 --> 29:11.967
No, I'm not leaving
the hospital.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.969
You do whatever you need to do.
I'm gonna stay right here.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.841
Okay.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.889
[indistinct chatter over P.A.]

29:22.935 --> 29:25.198
The guy's lying
through his teeth.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.200
What?He's lying.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.028
He just confirmed
everything you've been saying

29:29.071 --> 29:33.032
about your friend
this whole time.My friend was a SEAL, okay?

29:33.075 --> 29:35.077
I don't have to explain to you
what that means.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.905
Carson would have scoped
that house on Lanai out

29:36.949 --> 29:39.734
from top to bottom.
He's a special operator.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.258
He's not gonna walk into a house
up against five armed guys

29:42.302 --> 29:43.869
by himself. No way.No.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.305
He's brave, not suicidal.

29:45.348 --> 29:46.741
And he could've reached out
to Berg with an update.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.874
He could have
reached out to you.But he didn't.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.527
So if Berg's lying about Carson,

29:50.571 --> 29:52.051
he could be lying
about everything.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.836
There is one person we
haven't spoken to, all right?

29:54.880 --> 29:57.056
And I really believe if we want
to get to the truth in all this,

29:57.099 --> 29:59.101
we have to talk to
this kid's mother.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.958
[knock on door]

30:38.924 --> 30:40.708
Duke.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.145
What's going on?I'm sorry

30:43.189 --> 30:45.800
to have to do this, but HPD
received an anonymous tip.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.715
About what?

30:47.758 --> 30:49.891
A murder investigation.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.458
We need to search your house.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.377
Let's go, guys.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.265
EMMA:
All right, look,

31:16.309 --> 31:17.614
we need to expand the search
for a Julia Berg.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.355
She may not be at any
local hospitals or clinics,

31:19.399 --> 31:20.879
but the way the bullets
were flying at that house,

31:20.922 --> 31:22.315
odds are good
she would've caught one.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.926
Let's look at private
ambulance companies...

31:24.970 --> 31:26.536
Veterinary clinics.Shh.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.408
No, if she's captive
or in hiding, she may...Shh.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.322
...be trying to get her
treatment off the grid.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.324
Okay, good.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.369
Tell him. Tell him. Tell him.Yeah. No, no, he heard you.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.415
He heard you. All right,
Agent Vernon, thank you.Okay, good.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.417
Keep me posted.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.593
I'm starting to understand
why your partner was so happy

31:39.636 --> 31:42.378
to see you cuffed
to a table.
Excuse me?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.684
The interrupting.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.165
Do you do that all the time?Interrupting? I...

31:46.208 --> 31:48.254
'Cause it's incredibly annoying.
There it is again.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.820
I wasn't interrupting.
I was contributing.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.474
Oh, really?It's a... Is this
not a joint inves...

31:51.518 --> 31:53.172
I'm sorry, I thought it
was a joint investigation.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.304
Or is my only
contribution the driving?

31:55.348 --> 31:58.046
I'm just saying, 30-second
phone call, four interruptions.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.961
[phone ringing]Oh, check you out

32:00.005 --> 32:02.398
with your ever-growing list of
talents. I can now add math.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.792
Oh, yeah?
What else is on that list?

32:04.835 --> 32:06.794
Jerry, what do you got?JERRY [over phone]:
Commander,

32:06.837 --> 32:08.578
ballistics came back from Lanai,

32:08.622 --> 32:10.580
and it paints a very different
picture of our shootout.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.191
We've been working
under the assumption

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
that Carson super-soldiered
his way through the property,

32:14.584 --> 32:16.151
taking out Kalino
and his friends.
