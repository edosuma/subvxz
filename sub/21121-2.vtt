WEBVTT

00:00.116 --> 00:01.688
Previously on "The Night Shift"...

00:01.710 --> 00:03.920
We're taking everyone we can
to the base near the border.

00:03.945 --> 00:05.968
- Come with us.
- I can't leave Syd behind,

00:05.993 --> 00:07.328
and he's the only chance
I got of finding her.

00:07.353 --> 00:08.858
He and his people killed
our families and friends,

00:08.883 --> 00:10.336
maybe yours, too.

00:10.361 --> 00:12.664
You're a nurse and a temp one, at that.

00:12.689 --> 00:14.140
Do your job.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.953
- Mac.
- Where the hell am I?

00:15.978 --> 00:17.601
It's okay. We've got you.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.078
This is the freakin' V.A.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.703
This is the exact place I told
you I didn't wanna end up.

00:20.728 --> 00:21.851
- Mac. Mac, you gotta relax.
- Mac.

00:21.876 --> 00:22.976
He's seizing.

00:23.001 --> 00:24.268
And I don't know much about the V.A.

00:24.293 --> 00:26.389
I'll steer the ship,
and I'll aid in the transition.

00:26.414 --> 00:27.883
And what do you want in return?

00:27.908 --> 00:29.475
I want my family back.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.546
- And Paul. I want him back, too.
- I'll take care of it.

00:32.772 --> 00:34.858
Please come help us!

00:34.883 --> 00:37.140
- Oh, my God.
- I can only fit one of you in here.

00:37.165 --> 00:39.797
Abby's intestines are exposed.
The fall could kill her.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.969
- One, two... three!
- I'm not doing it!

00:42.994 --> 00:43.618
Aah!

00:43.643 --> 00:46.648
Sofia! You gotta let go,
or we're all gonna die.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.633
Save me!

00:49.031 --> 00:50.686
- No, I'm doing it!
- You have to.

00:50.711 --> 00:51.594
I'm not falling!

00:51.619 --> 00:54.155
We don't have any time for this.
Sofia, you gotta let go.

00:54.181 --> 00:55.781
- No, I can't.
- You have to.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.706
- That airbag will catch you.
- No, I...

00:57.731 --> 01:00.375
Everybody, clear out! Go, go! Go!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.458
Hey, you're unstable, Drew!

01:02.483 --> 01:03.937
Get her down now! Whatever it takes!

01:03.962 --> 01:05.725
Listen to me, listen to me, okay?

01:05.750 --> 01:07.383
I promise you, you're gonna be safe.

01:07.408 --> 01:07.860
No.

01:07.885 --> 01:09.195
I gotta do this. I'm so sorry.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.219
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- You can do it.

01:10.244 --> 01:16.320
Oh, my God. No. Stop! Aah!

01:16.345 --> 01:19.242
All right, go!

01:19.267 --> 01:21.399
Sofia's okay.

01:21.424 --> 01:22.915
Hey, Paul, clear an ambulance.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.469
Abby's bleeding out.
We're coming down. Let's go.

01:27.709 --> 01:31.209
So my friend is here? I said I had
another American, so they waited.

01:31.234 --> 01:34.268
Twice the money.

02:00.822 --> 02:02.189
T.C.!

02:02.214 --> 02:05.014
Syd. Thank God you're alive.

02:05.039 --> 02:06.223
Oh, my God!

02:06.248 --> 02:08.997
Shh, shh. We don't have much time.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.872
What are you doing?

02:11.897 --> 02:14.670
We've got to get outta here.

02:14.912 --> 02:17.573
- Did they hurt you?
- I'll be okay.

02:17.598 --> 02:18.732
These guys...
They're just bush league, okay?

02:18.757 --> 02:21.028
They just wanna get paid.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.840
The next stop is
Caliphate. Then we're dead.

02:22.865 --> 02:24.599
I thought I was gonna...

02:24.624 --> 02:26.671
No, no, hey, hey.
You are not going out like this.

02:26.695 --> 02:27.903
- Okay.
- I promise.

02:27.929 --> 02:30.327
Okay. I know.

02:39.498 --> 02:41.559
I debulked as much of
his tumor as possible

02:41.584 --> 02:43.040
without affecting his speech.

02:43.065 --> 02:44.863
So he'll need radiation and chemo?

02:44.888 --> 02:47.088
He has an aggressive glioblastoma.

02:47.132 --> 02:50.527
Going forward,
we have to weigh the cost/benefit.

02:50.729 --> 02:52.636
Are you saying that as his doctor

02:52.661 --> 02:54.910
or as the new owner of this hospital?

02:54.935 --> 02:58.135
Sergeant Riley's surgery
alone cost $150,000.

02:58.161 --> 03:00.176
The V.A. might not pay for it.

03:00.201 --> 03:02.836
And our deal with them won't
kick in for a few weeks.

03:02.861 --> 03:05.611
You know, Scott and I wouldn't
be here if it weren't for Mac.

03:05.828 --> 03:07.408
And I wouldn't have done his surgery

03:07.433 --> 03:09.439
if you hadn't ambushed me
with a press conference.

03:09.464 --> 03:13.064
Look, Julian, we thank you for
going the extra mile for Mac.

03:13.089 --> 03:16.119
We so appreciate it,
but he's my patient now.

03:16.144 --> 03:18.080
So let's get back to work.

03:18.105 --> 03:20.063
We got a sick hospital to save, right?

03:20.088 --> 03:21.682
I couldn't agree with you more, Scott.

03:21.707 --> 03:22.443
Good.

03:29.035 --> 03:30.962
You're gonna need an
operation to remove your lips

03:30.987 --> 03:32.821
from that man's butt.

03:32.893 --> 03:35.557
Hey. Look, I don't like him either,

03:35.582 --> 03:36.949
but he's a necessary evil.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.246
So what, pucker up, buttercup?

03:39.271 --> 03:40.405
Pick our battles.

03:40.576 --> 03:42.572
I'd say getting cutting
edge surgery for Mac

03:42.597 --> 03:44.064
is a damn good start.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.736
Right?

03:45.908 --> 03:48.575
Now let's bring Paul back in the boat.

03:53.644 --> 03:58.150
Pulse 137, BP's 81 over 40
after 500 CCs of NS

03:58.175 --> 03:59.275
and 4 of morphine.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.181
She has a wound dehiscence
from a recent operation.

04:01.221 --> 04:03.524
Hi, my name's Dr. Clemmens.
I'm gonna be doing your surgery.

04:03.549 --> 04:05.869
- Does it hurt anywhere else?
- No. Aah!

04:05.894 --> 04:07.541
Can you tell me about the
procedure that you had?

04:07.566 --> 04:09.150
Hi, I'm Abby's mom. I'm Dana.
What... what happened?

04:09.175 --> 04:09.967
I'm Dr. Alister.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.453
This is Dr. Clemmens, head of surgery.

04:11.478 --> 04:13.612
The accident opened up
Abby's abdominal wall.

04:13.637 --> 04:14.601
So she's in critical condition.

04:14.626 --> 04:15.744
We're gonna take her up to the O.R.

04:15.769 --> 04:17.688
Does you daughter have
any medical problems

04:17.713 --> 04:18.649
or history of surgery?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.024
No, no. She's always been
completely healthy.

04:20.048 --> 04:21.307
Are you sure? Because she's got...

04:21.332 --> 04:22.361
Ow!

04:22.386 --> 04:24.587
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, let's go.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.632
No, baby, I'm right here.
I'm right here. Wait.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.252
Abby, we need you to stay calm,

04:28.277 --> 04:29.160
or the bleeding's just gonna get worse.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.072
Your daughter's in good hands.

04:30.097 --> 04:32.267
- I'll update you as soon as we can.
- I'm not going anywhere.

04:32.292 --> 04:35.134
Abby, Abby, listen to
me. You had a surgery.

04:35.159 --> 04:36.400
I need to know exactly...

04:36.425 --> 04:38.166
You can't tell her. She doesn't know.

04:38.191 --> 04:39.010
Know what?

04:39.035 --> 04:41.900
I had an abortion in Juarez.

04:41.925 --> 04:45.228
Please don't let me die.

04:56.490 --> 05:00.643
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:08.057 --> 05:10.813
Omar? What'd you do?

05:10.838 --> 05:14.111
What I had to. Let's go. Now!

05:14.180 --> 05:15.619
Okay.

05:15.644 --> 05:18.213
They've changed the plans.
They were going to kill us.

05:20.947 --> 05:22.880
Aah!

05:23.236 --> 05:26.032
You need a hospital, Omar.
You've lost a lot of blood.

05:26.057 --> 05:28.752
I'll die anyway if the
Caliphate finds me.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.620
Just wanna go home, you know?

05:30.645 --> 05:34.752
Where are you from? London?

05:35.786 --> 05:37.920
Whitechapel.

05:37.945 --> 05:41.198
I watched videos,
came here to fight for jihad.

05:41.223 --> 05:43.790
Had no idea what the
Caliphate was really about.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.733
So why don't you go to Camp Yuma?

05:46.758 --> 05:50.733
It's an American base.
It's 50 clicks east of here.

05:50.758 --> 05:53.563
There's a chopper that comes
once a month from Turkey

05:53.588 --> 05:54.924
to deliver med supplies.

05:54.949 --> 05:56.774
We were supposed to fly out on it today.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.793
How do I know you won't betray
me to the American army?

06:00.818 --> 06:02.560
That they won't waterboard me?

06:02.585 --> 06:04.518
We'll tell them you saved our lives.

06:04.543 --> 06:06.854
You give them intel on the Caliphate,
you'll be safe.

06:06.879 --> 06:08.160
Promise.

06:09.215 --> 06:11.635
They'll pay you for the information.

06:11.660 --> 06:14.127
I mean, in three days
you will be in London,

06:14.152 --> 06:16.635
10,000 pounds in your pocket.

06:17.119 --> 06:19.407
Or you could, you know, bleed to death

06:19.432 --> 06:21.499
in some bombed out
building, and your family

06:21.530 --> 06:23.634
will never even know
what happened to you.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.541
Your call.

06:28.641 --> 06:31.242
How can I believe you?

06:31.945 --> 06:33.745
I give you my word.

06:34.206 --> 06:36.647
I got you this far, didn't I?

06:40.317 --> 06:43.550
Okay. I'll go.

06:46.158 --> 06:47.688
No!

06:47.713 --> 06:49.510
What the hell did you do that for?

06:49.535 --> 06:50.868
There's two of you and one of me.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.384
Now the odds are even.
Patch him up. Let's go.

06:59.931 --> 07:02.189
This amusement park mess is no joke.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.237
Yeah, more on the way.

07:03.262 --> 07:05.648
Drew has an intestinal
evisceration headed for the O.R.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.643
- Scott's on the way down.
- Okay, got it.

07:07.668 --> 07:09.311
Hey, Shannon, how are we doing
with the walking wounded?

07:09.336 --> 07:10.346
In the weeds,

07:10.371 --> 07:12.830
but Cain's is treating
and streeting like a boss.

07:14.557 --> 07:16.298
Yo, first shift and this guy
thinks he owns the place.

07:16.323 --> 07:19.757
- He's a damn good nurse, Kenny.
- Yeah, easy on the eyes, too.

07:24.730 --> 07:29.010
It's itching bad, Kenny.

07:29.035 --> 07:30.237
That cream didn't work.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.196
Whoa, whoa, Otto. Okay. Okay, just...

07:32.221 --> 07:34.986
Yeah, hold it right there. Uh...

07:36.886 --> 07:38.439
You know what?
I have just the guy for the job.

07:38.464 --> 07:40.346
Just wait right there.

07:41.086 --> 07:46.419
Yo, Diaz. Hey, bud, so, uh,
Otto here has crotch lice.

07:46.444 --> 07:48.016
- Uh, shave him.
- Now?

07:48.041 --> 07:50.120
- We have mass cas.
- It's killing me!

07:50.145 --> 07:53.206
Yeah, and my team's
got it. You got Otto.

07:54.230 --> 07:56.893
- He's yours.
- You're the boss, Kenny.

07:56.918 --> 07:59.519
Come on.

07:59.544 --> 08:01.552
Easy.

08:04.338 --> 08:06.946
Now you're still a little
groggy from the surgery.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.908
Surgery?

08:09.807 --> 08:13.073
We removed your tumor. Almost all of it.

08:13.104 --> 08:15.182
So I can die alone in some V.A.?

08:15.418 --> 08:17.010
No.

08:17.187 --> 08:19.127
No, Mac, you don't understand.

08:19.152 --> 08:21.197
We are the V.A. now...

08:21.296 --> 08:23.775
Me, Scott, Topher, Drew.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.464
We're gonna treat you.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.204
You should've let me go, Jordan.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.715
You dragged your ass
for 10 miles to safety.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.096
You lit rescue fires.

08:35.121 --> 08:37.788
You could've laid down at any time,
but you didn't.

08:37.813 --> 08:40.479
You didn't give up. You wanted to live.

08:40.965 --> 08:43.164
Yeah, but I don't wanna live like this.

08:44.282 --> 08:45.582
Stop.

08:45.607 --> 08:47.240
You knew that.

08:49.221 --> 08:50.987
I trusted you.

09:02.328 --> 09:04.140
Hey.

09:08.009 --> 09:10.133
You're right.

09:12.855 --> 09:15.922
Thanks.

09:21.073 --> 09:23.106
Thank you.

09:27.221 --> 09:29.283
How'd it go?

09:29.331 --> 09:33.181
Abby had omental bleeding and
multiple bowel perforations.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.775
So you had to do an enterotomy?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.651
Well, I made the repairs,

09:38.006 --> 09:40.627
but ran into a complication.

09:43.051 --> 09:45.251
Abby's still pregnant?

09:45.276 --> 09:47.142
Do you want to tell Abby or should I?

09:48.520 --> 09:49.604
What happened to Sofia?

09:49.629 --> 09:50.884
We were talking,
she started getting anxious,

09:50.909 --> 09:52.854
wanted to leave and started seizing.

09:53.432 --> 09:56.074
All right, let's get her to
C.T. Did the labs show anything?

09:56.099 --> 09:58.401
Elevated WBCs consistent
with a stress response.

09:58.426 --> 10:00.573
Negative pregnancy. Tox screen pending.

10:00.598 --> 10:03.440
Jordan. This our fall victim?

10:03.465 --> 10:05.026
'Cause our lawyer called and said

10:05.050 --> 10:06.690
your guy Drew pushed her?

10:06.715 --> 10:08.141
Okay, okay. Sofia was frantic,

10:08.166 --> 10:09.729
nearly tipped over the cherry picker.

10:09.754 --> 10:10.921
She could've killed everyone, all right?

10:10.946 --> 10:12.089
Should have his back on this one.

10:12.114 --> 10:15.190
I have the hospital's back,
Paul, which is all of ours.

10:15.278 --> 10:18.971
Except Topher's. He's got your
knife in his, right, Jordan?

10:18.996 --> 10:21.831
Okay, Paul, enough.
Get your patient to C.T. now.

10:25.465 --> 10:28.049
Dear God, man,
do you even think before you shoot?

10:28.074 --> 10:30.800
First of all, Drew is a hero
for what he did out there.

10:30.825 --> 10:32.595
And second, if you
want Paul to come back,

10:32.620 --> 10:34.502
you need to stop getting in
my way by picking fights.

10:34.527 --> 10:36.698
Well, he hasn't committed yet?

10:36.723 --> 10:39.951
No. And he's not going
to if you don't stop

10:39.976 --> 10:41.409
trying to show him that you're his boss.

10:41.434 --> 10:44.768
But I am his boss, Jordan.
So get him around that.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.393
And if you can't,
then... our deal's off.

10:51.206 --> 10:54.720
- Dad!
- Hey. What? Hey... oh.

10:54.745 --> 10:57.315
It's after midnight.
What... Is everything okay?

10:57.340 --> 11:00.432
Bri's chest was hurting
so I brought her in.

11:00.456 --> 11:02.925
I saw you on the news
with the roller coaster.

11:02.950 --> 11:05.002
It looked really scary.

11:05.455 --> 11:09.385
R-Right. Um, I was safe the entire time.

11:09.691 --> 11:12.589
But, Bri, did you lie to Mollie
about your chest hurting?

11:14.150 --> 11:17.317
Okay. You can't do that
every night Rick and I work.

11:17.342 --> 11:19.638
I had to know that you were all right.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.723
Are you mad?

11:22.624 --> 11:24.757
No.

11:24.782 --> 11:28.148
Okay? But I do have to
talk to a patient's mom,

11:28.173 --> 11:30.835
and you have to get home
and get some sleep. Okay?

11:30.860 --> 11:32.449
Mols, can you bring the little monster

11:32.474 --> 11:34.615
back for breakfast after my shift ends?

11:34.640 --> 11:36.201
- No problem.
- I owe you.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.406
Hi. How's Abby?

11:38.431 --> 11:41.546
Uh... good. Uh, surgery went well.

11:41.571 --> 11:42.468
Good.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.779
She's in post-op.
The recovery nurse will let you know

11:44.804 --> 11:46.452
- when you can see her.
- Great.

11:46.478 --> 11:48.202
But we're not out of the woods yet.

11:48.227 --> 11:51.711
Um, Abby's friend, uh, Sofia.

11:52.404 --> 11:56.030
Her dad basically develops
condos and just throws a ton

11:56.055 --> 11:57.693
of money at her so he
doesn't have to deal.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.022
I realize I probably shouldn't
let Abby hang out with her,

12:00.047 --> 12:03.615
but I'm in the army and I just
spent nine months in Korea,

12:03.640 --> 12:06.476
so makes it kind of hard to
veto who your kid's friends are.

12:06.501 --> 12:07.967
No, I'm in the service, too.

12:07.992 --> 12:10.398
Yeah, I've deployed,
just never as a dad.

12:10.423 --> 12:10.976
Yeah.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.427
Can't imagine what that would be like.

12:12.452 --> 12:14.773
Rips your heart out.
Try to make it work, right?

12:14.798 --> 12:17.765
Being a soldier and a mom.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.468
Can't be in two places at once, though.

12:21.726 --> 12:22.953
Right.

12:22.978 --> 12:25.202
Sorry, I'm... I'm gonna call my folks

12:25.227 --> 12:26.718
- and just give them an update.
- Okay.

12:26.743 --> 12:27.554
Thank you.

12:27.579 --> 12:28.695
Yeah, I'll... I'll keep you updated.

12:28.721 --> 12:30.021
Thank you.

12:37.210 --> 12:39.967
He made you shave Otto's balls?
You're an R.N.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.437
Dude's got issues.
Anyway, we're getting stacked up.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.562
Next patient, Joan Fraley.

12:43.587 --> 12:46.006
Amusement park janitor with dizziness,
possible syncope.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.564
Miss Fraley, I'm Dr. Rivera.

12:47.589 --> 12:48.945
I heard you might've fainted at work.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.233
After the coaster derailed.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.425
My dad used to black out sometimes.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.350
He had a bad heart his whole life.

12:54.380 --> 12:57.046
Where's my damn doctor?!

12:57.071 --> 12:58.938
Dr. Rivera, your facial lac is ready

12:58.963 --> 13:00.547
- for her sutures, please.
- Okay. Coming.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.921
Cain, can you start on her workup?
I'll be back soon.

13:02.946 --> 13:05.109
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, and your dad...

13:05.134 --> 13:08.250
- How's he doing?
- Gone. Heart attack last year.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.671
I keep thinking I'm next, you know?

13:09.695 --> 13:11.219
I'm sorry to hear that, but listen,

13:11.244 --> 13:14.360
I know you're worried, but your
dad's story is not necessarily yours.

13:14.384 --> 13:16.202
We're gonna do a full
cardiac workup on you.

13:16.227 --> 13:18.296
Okay.

13:18.321 --> 13:20.277
Amazing, huh?

13:20.561 --> 13:22.552
Hmm.

13:22.961 --> 13:25.794
He's beautiful.

13:26.295 --> 13:28.350
Yeah.

13:32.038 --> 13:34.022
So Mexico...

13:34.283 --> 13:37.692
Why risk going so far
away for an abortion?

13:38.685 --> 13:41.117
You have to get your
parent's approval in Texas.

13:41.381 --> 13:43.115
I couldn't tell my mom.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.950
Well, now you have to, right?

13:46.123 --> 13:49.959
How? She missed going to college
because she got pregnant with me

13:49.984 --> 13:53.017
and now I can't go because
I made the same mistake?

13:54.885 --> 13:56.918
It'll kill her.

14:00.190 --> 14:02.324
Kids hate to disappoint their parents.

14:04.407 --> 14:06.373
Trust me, I know.

14:06.398 --> 14:09.209
But I would gladly have
my daughter hurt me,

14:09.234 --> 14:11.518
instead of hurting herself.

14:12.156 --> 14:14.289
Same with your mom, Abby.

14:14.314 --> 14:16.856
I'm telling you, you'll feel better.

14:17.684 --> 14:19.184
You will.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.236
I just...

14:23.025 --> 14:26.359
When I left Juarez, I felt so guilty.

14:27.874 --> 14:32.664
And now I feel like I've been
given a second chance and...

14:33.632 --> 14:36.042
I'm just so confused.

14:36.971 --> 14:38.815
I know.

14:40.577 --> 14:44.467
But I bet I know someone who
can help you sort things out.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.720
Hey, baby girl.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.302
Hi, baby.

14:56.401 --> 14:58.853
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Thank you.

15:06.593 --> 15:09.093
- Hey, Shannon, you got a sec?
- No, I got two facial lacs

15:09.118 --> 15:11.000
and a syncope patient to wrap up.

15:11.190 --> 15:14.101
Uh, hey, Paul,
heard you stood up for me with your dad.

15:14.126 --> 15:17.445
- That mean you're back?
- I want to, but it's complicated, man.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.670
Not really.
Just rip the Band-Aid off already.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.902
Exactly.
Me and Jordan, Shannon, I mean, hell,

15:21.926 --> 15:22.976
even Topher's back.

15:23.001 --> 15:24.242
Topher's back? You're dreaming.

15:24.267 --> 15:26.984
Unh-unh, we talked to him today.
He'll be here tomorrow.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.335
Your dad's met you more than
halfway, Paul. Your move.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.723
Jordan, got our results?

15:31.748 --> 15:33.348
Hey, Sofia.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.964
Okay, you're head CT looks normal.

15:37.585 --> 15:39.285
Hey.

15:39.310 --> 15:42.316
You're the... dick that dropped me.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.153
- Memory's intact.
- The dysarthria's new.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.893
- Like, I can't...
- All right, hold, hold.

15:48.918 --> 15:51.777
Move my left or... arm or leg.

15:51.802 --> 15:52.988
What's happening to me?

15:53.013 --> 15:54.909
Well, Sofia, you had a seizure,

15:54.933 --> 15:57.086
and sometimes that's followed
up by temporary paralysis.

15:57.110 --> 15:59.177
- Whoa, you think this is Todd's?
- No way.

15:59.203 --> 16:00.426
Okay. Drew's right.

16:00.451 --> 16:01.918
The whiplash from the
fall may have caused

16:01.943 --> 16:03.183
a torn blood vessel in your neck.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.730
We need an MRI to get a clearer picture,
okay?

16:04.755 --> 16:05.684
Sure, got it.

16:05.709 --> 16:08.842
Um, that's a vertebral
artery dissection, Paul.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.809
I can't let you upstairs
unless you're on the staff,

16:10.834 --> 16:14.684
so... which is it?
Are you in or you out?

16:16.676 --> 16:20.110
Paul, help me, please.
I'm really scared.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.951
Give radiology a heads up.
We're coming in hot to MRI.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.453
Ah, son of a bitch.

16:35.478 --> 16:37.322
You knew it wasn't Todd's Paralysis.

16:37.347 --> 16:38.714
You were just getting
Paul more invested.

16:38.739 --> 16:40.106
Yeah, I was waiting for you to catch on.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.585
I thought I was gonna
have to send up flares.

16:50.548 --> 16:52.262
Hey, you okay?

16:52.287 --> 16:54.685
I'm fine.

16:54.833 --> 16:57.326
Syd, take the wheel.
Take the wheel. Look out.

17:04.085 --> 17:07.544
- Syd, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, but Omar's not.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.732
Let's get him onto level ground.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.491
- Come on, buddy.
- Come on, buddy.

17:23.971 --> 17:27.037
Okay, weak pulse.
Trachea's pulled to one side.

17:27.061 --> 17:29.462
- Classic tension pneumo.
- Okay, let's switch sides.

17:32.556 --> 17:35.430
- I'll use this.
- Do it.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.625
One, two, three.

17:43.518 --> 17:46.024
He still in distress?

17:46.589 --> 17:47.889
I can hear his stomach
in his chest cavity.

17:47.914 --> 17:49.749
It's a gastrothorax.

17:49.774 --> 17:51.835
Rebar must've tore a
hole in his diaphragm.

17:51.860 --> 17:54.008
He's suffocating. Use
this to make a valve.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.789
I'll find something to
decompress his stomach.

17:55.814 --> 17:57.344
What?

17:58.215 --> 18:01.749
We are sitting ducks out here.
We've got to keep moving.

18:01.774 --> 18:03.540
Okay, if we don't fix Omar now,
he's gonna die.

18:03.565 --> 18:04.632
Okay, what about that speech you made

18:04.665 --> 18:05.938
about getting him to London?

18:06.030 --> 18:07.697
I lied.

18:07.722 --> 18:09.733
Yuma's not gonna let him go.

18:09.758 --> 18:11.219
He killed three of
his own in cold blood.

18:11.244 --> 18:12.149
To save us!

18:12.174 --> 18:14.633
Or to sell us to the highest bidder.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.501
- Okay.
- Who knows what's up on that road?

18:16.526 --> 18:18.258
I made him a promise. I'm keeping it.

18:18.283 --> 18:20.433
He's our NG tube.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.181
Sorry for the wait, Joan.

18:24.205 --> 18:26.178
I don't feel right.
It's hard to breathe.

18:26.203 --> 18:27.774
Don't let me die, please.

18:31.219 --> 18:33.419
I'll get Dr. Rivera.

18:33.457 --> 18:36.163
- Dr. Rivera?
- Hey, Jocelyn, I need help.

18:36.188 --> 18:37.650
I can't. I got a breech BOA came in.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.079
Okay.

18:41.129 --> 18:43.253
Coming through, coming through.

18:44.143 --> 18:46.781
Joan? Hey, Joan. Hey.

18:46.815 --> 18:48.115
She's not breathing!

18:59.299 --> 19:00.633
I need help in here!

19:00.658 --> 19:02.176
I'm back, I'm back. Where's Shannon?

19:02.201 --> 19:05.469
No idea. Here, grab the bag.
Resume ventilation.

19:05.567 --> 19:09.157
- What happened to her?
- Peri-arrest bradycardia.

19:09.430 --> 19:14.297
No response to Epi or external pacing.

19:14.322 --> 19:18.773
She's gonna code.

19:18.798 --> 19:21.731
- I'm placing a CPT.
- A central line? Are you joking?

19:21.756 --> 19:23.290
She needs a transvenous pacemaker.

19:23.444 --> 19:24.673
No, she needs a doctor.

19:24.698 --> 19:26.498
Cain, I am not gonna get fired for this.

19:26.523 --> 19:29.657
I need an Attending in here now!

19:29.682 --> 19:31.944
Carla, go and find Dr.
Rivera for me now, please.

19:31.969 --> 19:33.298
Jocelyn!

19:33.926 --> 19:35.826
It's just an LMA. She lost her airway.

19:36.061 --> 19:38.313
Okay. Keep bagging her.

19:42.551 --> 19:44.720
You're gonna need a new
job when Kenny finds out.

19:44.744 --> 19:47.844
What? That I saved Rivera's ass?

19:47.869 --> 19:49.781
Cain! What the hell are you doing?

19:49.806 --> 19:51.339
Third-degree heart block.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.031
You were busy. She was about to die.

19:53.056 --> 19:55.602
- I'll call cardiology.
- No time. Glove up.

19:55.635 --> 19:56.680
You're placing a transvenous pacemaker.

19:56.705 --> 19:59.010
- I've never even seen one!
- It's a simple procedure.

19:59.035 --> 20:00.330
Once I place a central line,

20:00.355 --> 20:01.588
all you have to do is
float the pacemaker.

20:01.613 --> 20:03.455
Come on, let's go! Glove up!

20:06.690 --> 20:08.290
Advance the pacer wire 30 centimeters.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.573
Good. Now inflate the balloon.

20:12.598 --> 20:15.260
- How much air?
- 1.5 CCs.

20:15.285 --> 20:18.219
Generator's on.
Now keep your eye on the monitor

20:18.244 --> 20:20.640
and advance slowly.

20:22.493 --> 20:24.877
Whoa, Shannon, too
fast. You're in too far.

20:24.902 --> 20:26.121
You're gonna perforate the myocardial.

20:26.146 --> 20:27.779
Now back it out.

20:28.118 --> 20:30.938
Okay, let the balloon
float into position.

20:33.862 --> 20:37.160
- We've got capture.
- Good. Now deflate the balloon...

20:37.602 --> 20:39.447
and secure the line.

20:39.679 --> 20:41.816
Cardiology's on the line.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.160
Finally.

20:45.891 --> 20:47.955
You okay, Joan?

20:55.188 --> 20:58.366
- You're not an R.N., Cain.
- You can see my license.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.133
Save it. Nurses can't
place central lines

21:00.158 --> 21:01.719
or float a pacemaker.

21:01.744 --> 21:03.203
Who the hell are you?

21:05.624 --> 21:07.774
Here, use his blood
to lubricate the tube.

21:15.305 --> 21:18.032
- I got him.
- Okay.

21:21.344 --> 21:23.178
I hope you're right about this.

21:23.203 --> 21:25.374
- That makes three of us.
- You do the honors.

21:25.399 --> 21:27.203
Okay.

21:40.571 --> 21:42.735
Sorry I'm not 72 virgins.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.290
You're more beautiful.

21:45.701 --> 21:47.735
The chopper leaves at sundown.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.073
We need to get out of here.

21:49.098 --> 21:51.135
If not, we're gonna be in this
hell hole for another month.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.093
He has internal bleeding.
The road might kill him.

21:53.118 --> 21:54.551
Better him than me.

21:54.638 --> 21:58.772
You've done all you can, Doctor.
It's with Allah now.

21:58.797 --> 22:01.514
Let's go. Let's go.

22:01.539 --> 22:04.740
She risked dying in Mexico
instead of telling me.

22:05.436 --> 22:08.002
Guess I'm not gonna win
mother of the year award, huh?

22:08.027 --> 22:10.257
She tried to take care of
it before you got back.

22:10.282 --> 22:11.008
Mm.

22:11.033 --> 22:12.456
She knows how much
you sacrifice for her.

22:12.481 --> 22:16.414
Have I? I mean, my parents
have basically raised her.

22:16.539 --> 22:19.088
- You said it made it easier.
- No, I said it helped.

22:19.113 --> 22:21.758
Nothing makes being
away from your kid easy.

22:24.872 --> 22:26.851
When I got pregnant with Abby,

22:26.876 --> 22:30.099
my parents were so mad that
I had just ruined my life.

22:30.124 --> 22:33.181
And then she came along,
and she just won 'em over.

22:34.460 --> 22:37.352
But they're pushing 70 now,
and I have to go back to Korea.

22:37.377 --> 22:39.692
I'm not even gonna be
here when the baby's born.

22:39.717 --> 22:41.316
Tell your Commander about your hardship.

22:41.341 --> 22:42.664
Ask for leniency.

22:42.689 --> 22:45.589
And have somebody else with
a family be put in my place?

22:46.677 --> 22:48.618
You served, Drew.

22:48.643 --> 22:50.343
What would you do?

22:52.422 --> 22:54.938
Julian, I think you've got
a decision to make here.

22:54.963 --> 22:58.711
You can either be Paul's dad,
or you can be his boss.

22:58.736 --> 23:00.469
But you can't be both.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.512
I am with my other kids.

23:02.778 --> 23:05.612
Yeah, and how are those
relationships working out?

23:07.261 --> 23:09.823
So what's your solution with Paul?

23:12.973 --> 23:15.839
You make me medical and
surgical center director.

23:16.370 --> 23:20.358
Then Paul reports to me,
not you, and you can be the dad.

23:21.547 --> 23:23.307
And I'll be the boss.

23:23.332 --> 23:25.780
Nice try, Scott.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.438
But stay in your own lane.

23:27.463 --> 23:29.696
I can manage this hospital and my son.

23:32.253 --> 23:35.220
Did my parents call from Hawaii?

23:35.245 --> 23:38.643
Um, not yet, okay? But
I'm sure they will.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.831
Her toxicology report came back. Okay.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.953
Sofia, you tested positive for cocaine.

23:44.978 --> 23:46.424
That explains the elevated heart rate.

23:46.449 --> 23:50.509
Please... don't tell... Tell my dad.

23:50.534 --> 23:53.447
He'll be so pissed at me

23:53.472 --> 23:56.705
and send me back to the creepy shrink.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.821
O-Okay, this is...
this is not about your dad, okay?

23:58.846 --> 24:00.580
This is about saving your life.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.505
I don't have a problem. I swear.

24:02.530 --> 24:04.030
All right, you have to...

24:05.871 --> 24:09.166
She's hypotensive. Okay.
Reverse Trendelenburg. Hang a liter.

24:09.284 --> 24:11.484
Yeah, MRI results. Okay.

24:11.509 --> 24:13.573
I was right. She has basilar stroke.

24:13.598 --> 24:15.865
BP's up. Temp's 102.

24:17.782 --> 24:20.048
She's seizing again.

24:20.945 --> 24:23.629
This can't just be from the cocaine.

24:24.067 --> 24:26.700
Okay.

24:26.725 --> 24:29.260
Hold it. That's... That's not a seizure.

24:29.285 --> 24:30.452
Get her to the angio suite now.

24:30.477 --> 24:31.745
Tell them to give me two minutes.

24:36.783 --> 24:38.235
Hold the Valium!

24:38.260 --> 24:39.860
Oh, thanks for coming, Paul.

24:39.885 --> 24:41.918
While you were on your wild goose chase,

24:41.943 --> 24:43.643
she's having another seizure.

24:43.667 --> 24:45.463
Hey, Sofia, can you
drink this for me? Okay?

24:45.488 --> 24:47.319
It'll stop the shaking.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.370
There you go. Okay.

24:50.395 --> 24:51.828
Good job.

24:51.853 --> 24:52.916
Okay.

24:52.941 --> 24:55.274
It's spontaneous clonus
from serotonin syndrome.

24:55.299 --> 24:58.266
My goose chase was to the
pharmacy for cyproheptadine.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.330
- The antidote.
- Lab tests?

25:00.355 --> 25:02.667
No, talking and listening to my patient.

25:02.691 --> 25:05.479
Amazing how that works sometimes.
Good job, okay?

25:05.504 --> 25:06.900
She said she'd been to a therapist,

25:06.925 --> 25:08.854
so I ran a tox screen
for antidepressants,

25:08.879 --> 25:10.956
came back positive.
Tricyclics plus cocaine,

25:10.981 --> 25:12.747
and Fentanyl triggered the clonus.

25:13.403 --> 25:17.729
That's a hell of a catch, Paul.
You know what? Scrub in.

25:17.754 --> 25:20.769
I'll let you two chase the clot.

25:24.342 --> 25:26.642
Cain, go ahead.
Tell Jordan what you told me,

25:26.667 --> 25:28.617
- who you really are.
- I don't wanna do this.

25:28.642 --> 25:31.008
You know, she dragged me off the floor.
You might as well.

25:32.508 --> 25:33.729
Tell her.

25:36.103 --> 25:40.372
I was an Attending in Nogales.
México, not Arizona.

25:40.397 --> 25:45.043
We had cartel violence,
shootings, amputations, rapes.

25:45.068 --> 25:47.068
Like a contest to please the devil.

25:47.093 --> 25:48.798
Anyway, after eight years of that,

25:48.823 --> 25:52.431
I was numb and I had to
leave before I lost myself.

25:52.456 --> 25:54.743
So I got my nursing license and a visa,

25:54.768 --> 25:57.767
and I could work anywhere...
Dallas, Austin, Houston.

25:57.792 --> 26:01.142
In Mexico, he's you, Jordan.
Here, he's not even Kenny.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.657
So why not just be a doctor?

26:04.939 --> 26:06.813
My English was bad,

26:06.838 --> 26:09.010
plus I'd have to start
from scratch as a resident.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.314
5,000 people applying for every slot,

26:11.339 --> 26:14.322
not a lot of those going to
foreign nationals these days.

26:15.047 --> 26:16.892
Yeah, Cain, that's a hell of a story,

26:16.917 --> 26:19.392
but I'm sorry, I have to let you go.

26:19.417 --> 26:20.775
Jordan, are you serious?

26:20.800 --> 26:23.517
If I were Jordan, I'd do the same thing.

26:23.542 --> 26:26.710
I overstepped,
and I'd do it again if needed.

26:26.993 --> 26:28.593
Impossible not to.

26:33.057 --> 26:35.174
We have an approaching!

26:40.909 --> 26:44.533
Slowly! One by one, get out!

26:47.394 --> 26:49.368
My name is Major Sydney Jennings.

26:49.393 --> 26:50.917
I'm an American doctor.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.088
I was kidnapped by rebels near Aleppo.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.142
We need medical assistance.

26:54.167 --> 26:56.845
She's okay! Is Dr. Callahan with you?

26:56.870 --> 26:58.537
He's in the back.

26:58.799 --> 27:01.232
- You made it.
- Barely.

27:01.257 --> 27:03.163
Omar did, too.

27:04.441 --> 27:06.625
He's under American care now.

27:06.861 --> 27:09.103
This man here... He saved our lives.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.715
He's got intel on the Caliphate.
So he needs an O.R. immediately.

27:15.579 --> 27:18.424
You kept your promise, Doctor.

27:18.449 --> 27:20.205
You take care.

27:23.948 --> 27:27.595
Syd, this is Amira.
She's a doctor in Aleppo.

27:27.620 --> 27:28.898
Does search and rescue.

27:28.923 --> 27:32.323
You saved that scum and now
you'll pay him to tell you lies.

27:32.348 --> 27:33.955
Yeah, if he doesn't
have a change of heart.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.500
What? The first leopard
to change his spots?

27:35.525 --> 27:36.642
Are you that stupid?

27:36.667 --> 27:40.126
Yes. Yes, he is. And wounded.

27:40.152 --> 27:43.648
He needs a complete
washout and IV antibiotics.

27:43.673 --> 27:45.486
I need to find the base commander.

27:45.511 --> 27:46.957
Follow me.

27:47.850 --> 27:50.133
We got a chopper to catch.

27:55.511 --> 27:58.080
The microwire's in the thrombus.

27:58.105 --> 27:59.772
I see it.

28:00.014 --> 28:01.847
Passing the catheter now.

28:01.872 --> 28:05.634
- I hear you're back on staff.
- I am.

28:06.838 --> 28:08.871
This isn't working, Dad.

28:09.464 --> 28:11.597
For either one of us.

28:11.806 --> 28:14.443
We need to separate work from family.

28:15.082 --> 28:18.015
- I already do that.
- Since when?

28:18.061 --> 28:19.927
You're a workaholic, okay?

28:19.952 --> 28:21.501
My whole life, whenever
I wanted to see you,

28:21.526 --> 28:23.827
I had to go to a hospital to do it.

28:24.172 --> 28:26.830
So you learn how to use hemostat

28:26.855 --> 28:28.499
instead of throw a baseball?

28:28.524 --> 28:30.822
I guess that turned
out horribly for you.

28:30.847 --> 28:33.963
And so you get defensive and shut down.
Helpful.

28:33.988 --> 28:36.033
I'm not defensive.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.180
That was a joke, Paul.

28:39.205 --> 28:41.477
Look, I-I don't need your approval

28:41.502 --> 28:43.361
or your help, Dad.

28:43.435 --> 28:45.291
I'm a damn good surgeon.

28:45.316 --> 28:47.649
And that is all I wanna be
when I come to work, okay?

28:47.674 --> 28:49.841
No favors or expectations,
no car payments,

28:49.866 --> 28:51.599
or med school loans.

28:51.907 --> 28:56.049
I'm not your son when I'm here.
Just another doctor on staff.

28:59.369 --> 29:02.611
Well, I guess your demands
aren't too demanding.

29:03.201 --> 29:05.577
I'll take that deal.

29:11.659 --> 29:13.548
Then you can go, Doctor.

29:13.573 --> 29:15.963
Lytic opened up the artery.
There's good flow.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.755
I'll take over from here.

29:27.984 --> 29:31.080
Drew! Abby's crashing.
They're taking her to the O.R.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.597
No! My stomach... it hurts!

29:36.622 --> 29:38.839
What is happening to her?
It's either an infection or bleeding.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.831
We need to get her back in the
O.R. to take a second look.

29:40.856 --> 29:42.439
What about my baby?
Please, please, don't hurt my baby.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.053
Abby, we're gonna do our best.

29:44.078 --> 29:45.439
Okay, Scott, I'm
scrubbing in for this one.

29:45.464 --> 29:46.330
Fine. Let's go.

29:46.355 --> 29:47.947
Drew. Listen, I messed up with Abby.

29:47.972 --> 29:49.672
I need a chance to make it right.

29:49.697 --> 29:52.130
Whatever you have to do, just save her.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.986
Drew!

29:54.011 --> 29:55.174
Please.

30:05.086 --> 30:07.780
So, Sofia, your mom
and dad are on the way,

30:07.805 --> 30:09.398
flying in right now.

30:10.391 --> 30:13.728
Were they super pissed at me?

30:13.753 --> 30:15.686
Not as much as they were at me.

30:15.711 --> 30:18.178
I told them that neglect
is a form of abuse,

30:18.203 --> 30:20.711
even if it comes with a credit
card and an Uber account.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.265
It's time your parents
started acting like parents,

30:22.290 --> 30:25.199
and if they didn't,
I was calling Child Services.

30:26.328 --> 30:30.156
W-Wow. Y-You said that?

30:30.181 --> 30:33.499
I did, but by the end of the call,

30:33.711 --> 30:35.834
they were in tears.

30:36.073 --> 30:38.406
They really love you, Sofia, and...

30:38.438 --> 30:40.738
they wanna try and change things.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.926
I'd like that.

30:43.951 --> 30:46.055
But hey, this is on you, too, okay?

30:46.080 --> 30:48.947
Things you were doing to hurt them,
it only hurts you.

30:49.256 --> 30:52.758
I-I know. I'm sorry.

30:53.828 --> 30:58.482
You... must have pretty great parents

30:58.507 --> 31:01.917
to turn out the way that you did.

31:01.942 --> 31:03.315
Yeah, I guess.

31:03.340 --> 31:06.373
Anyways, let's get you better, okay?

31:06.844 --> 31:09.159
So Abby had a bowel perforation

31:09.184 --> 31:10.386
hidden by a hematoma.

31:10.411 --> 31:13.478
We tried to reattach the ends,
but there was too much swelling.

31:13.503 --> 31:15.518
So we had to do a colostomy.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.656
All her plans are derailed now.

31:18.990 --> 31:20.624
It's my fault.

31:20.649 --> 31:22.464
I don't know about that, Dana.

31:22.629 --> 31:25.662
Mexican abortion, an evisceration,

31:25.687 --> 31:28.136
seems like this baby was meant to be.

31:28.467 --> 31:30.433
My baby's okay?

31:30.558 --> 31:34.225
- Hey.
- Yeah. For now.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.811
Good.

31:35.991 --> 31:37.857
Some family will be very happy.

31:39.179 --> 31:41.579
Honey, what are you talking about?

31:42.532 --> 31:46.060
I was thinking about
putting it up for adoption.

31:47.344 --> 31:51.118
I'm too young to be a mom,
and I'm not strong enough.

31:52.135 --> 31:54.268
I could never do as good a job as you.

31:55.639 --> 31:58.039
You're gonna change some
family's life forever.

31:58.064 --> 32:00.377
It's an amazing gift.

32:01.106 --> 32:02.573
And you know what else?

32:02.598 --> 32:04.806
I'll be here for you
every step of the way.

32:04.831 --> 32:07.806
- You're staying?
- Yeah.

32:07.831 --> 32:09.439
You applied for hardship.

32:09.464 --> 32:11.680
I nearly lost my girl.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.147
Busted my hump for 15
years for that army.

32:14.172 --> 32:15.546
If they can't give me this time off,

32:15.571 --> 32:17.178
- then to hell with them.
- Mm-hmm.

32:17.203 --> 32:20.250
Yo. Abby.

32:20.275 --> 32:21.425
Sofia!

32:21.450 --> 32:24.091
I thought they might
want to see each other.

32:25.408 --> 32:28.551
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

32:33.453 --> 32:34.932
Chopper's here.

32:35.485 --> 32:38.752
Base commander gave me passes
to the embassy in Ankara.

32:38.777 --> 32:40.777
I got you some
hydrocodone for your pain.

32:40.802 --> 32:42.206
It's gonna knock you right out.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.330
Thank you, Syd.

32:45.106 --> 32:46.740
I'm gonna stay here.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.342
They can fix your shoulder in Turkey.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.677
It's not life-threatening.

32:52.291 --> 32:54.635
Are you kidding me?

32:54.660 --> 32:56.221
Do you have a death wish, Callahan?

32:56.246 --> 32:58.446
No, no, the opposite. I...

32:58.471 --> 32:59.901
Look...

32:59.926 --> 33:02.522
My life back home was a trainwreck.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.579
And even though this place is a mess,

33:04.604 --> 33:06.221
it kind of makes sense to me.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.284
Everyone wants to hashtag "Save Aleppo"

33:08.309 --> 33:11.990
like it does something,
but I can make things better.

33:13.293 --> 33:15.518
You can do that in San Antonio.

33:15.543 --> 33:17.940
Anyone can do that in San Antonio,

33:18.103 --> 33:20.669
but not many people can do it here.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.761
It's why you came.

33:22.786 --> 33:24.904
It's who we are.

33:24.929 --> 33:26.797
It's who I was.

33:27.026 --> 33:29.459
This trip has cured me of that.

33:29.857 --> 33:31.969
No, I doubt that.

33:42.717 --> 33:44.881
Ah.

33:44.906 --> 33:48.527
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:48.830 --> 33:51.597
Thank you for coming
back and getting me...

33:51.622 --> 33:56.388
Getting me home to my
daughter, thank you.

34:04.799 --> 34:08.464
I'm gonna see you in Texas.
I'm buying the beer.

34:14.603 --> 34:16.534
- Better go.
- Yeah.

34:16.559 --> 34:19.043
Last time we did this,
we got hit by mortar fire so...

34:22.150 --> 34:24.551
You die over here, I'm gonna be really,
really pissed at you.

34:24.576 --> 34:25.743
- I won't.
- Yeah.

34:25.768 --> 34:26.768
I promise.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.777
- Yo, Joss.
- Hey.

34:39.802 --> 34:43.592
Hey, so I heard Jordan fired Cain.
Pisses me off.

34:43.617 --> 34:45.585
I wanted to fire his arrogant ass.

34:45.610 --> 34:48.023
- Oh, so you haven't heard.
- What?

34:48.047 --> 34:50.547
Hey, guess what? Did you hear?

34:50.572 --> 34:53.373
Cain's a doctor.
And now he's gonna work here.

34:53.956 --> 34:57.415
- I'm sorry, what?
- Hey, that's fantastic.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.751
I knew there was something
special about you.

34:59.776 --> 35:02.798
Yeah. He ran one of the
toughest E.R.s in Mexico.

35:02.823 --> 35:04.126
That he did.

35:04.151 --> 35:05.878
You know, he checked out.
We're short-staffed.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.369
So I hired him as a resident.

35:07.394 --> 35:10.548
We're getting a T.C. experience
at Shannon prices. Win/win.

35:10.573 --> 35:13.507
So great news. Huh, Kenny?

35:14.217 --> 35:17.728
Yeah, no. It's, uh... yeah, it's great.

35:17.753 --> 35:19.117
Um...

35:19.413 --> 35:21.778
- Listen, and about earlier...
- Yeah.

35:21.803 --> 35:24.001
You know, no hard feelings, man.
I was just doing my job, so...

35:24.026 --> 35:25.814
No. No, no, no, no hard feelings at all.
I totally get it.

35:25.839 --> 35:27.039
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no.

35:27.064 --> 35:28.097
All right, man. Thanks
for understanding.

35:28.122 --> 35:29.391
Yeah, yeah. I'm just doing my job,

35:29.416 --> 35:30.892
and you work for me now, yeah?

35:30.917 --> 35:31.736
Yeah, yeah.

35:31.761 --> 35:34.275
So there's a homeless guy, curtain 3,

35:34.300 --> 35:36.066
has a boil on his scrotum.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.798
- Needs his shave first.
- Come on, man.

35:44.823 --> 35:45.970
Oh, yeah. Get every hair.

35:45.995 --> 35:48.917
I want him looking like a newborn baby.

35:50.069 --> 35:52.651
Gonna be great working with you, Kenny.

35:53.427 --> 35:55.447
I'm sorry for shooting
you down like that.

35:55.472 --> 35:57.892
No, that's okay. I was out of line.

35:57.917 --> 36:01.548
No, no, you were right.
I don't need to micromanage Paul.

36:01.573 --> 36:04.837
- You should micromanage Paul.
- So that means...

36:04.862 --> 36:07.629
I'm choosing being his
dad over being his boss.

36:08.089 --> 36:09.970
But I still need you to

36:09.995 --> 36:11.673
get the surgical center off the ground.

36:11.698 --> 36:13.671
You up for two full-time jobs?

36:17.481 --> 36:19.628
I just e-mailed you
department breakdowns

36:19.653 --> 36:21.276
hospital-wide, where we're weak,

36:21.301 --> 36:23.909
- where we're strong.
- I'll set up a meeting tomorrow.

36:23.934 --> 36:25.892
Great.

36:28.573 --> 36:32.940
So, uh... is that what it looked like?

36:32.986 --> 36:35.485
Julian just made me medical
director of the E.R.

36:35.510 --> 36:37.676
and head of the new
cardiac surgical center.

36:37.701 --> 36:40.135
Wow. Is that some sort of a power play?

36:40.160 --> 36:42.971
Look, Julian is a
complete control freak.

36:42.996 --> 36:44.878
But he'll get bored of
this place and put some

36:44.903 --> 36:47.581
bean-counting jackass in
charge that we'll all hate.

36:47.606 --> 36:51.479
- Oh, so you're that jackass?
- In title, yeah.

36:51.838 --> 36:54.472
Look, I can make him think
he's running this place

36:54.497 --> 36:55.760
from a distance, and meanwhile,

36:55.785 --> 36:58.085
we keep everything exactly
the same way it's always been.

36:58.110 --> 37:00.144
Hmm. That's very impressive.

37:00.169 --> 37:02.635
- Right?
- Mm.

37:02.976 --> 37:05.564
So I guess that means

37:05.589 --> 37:08.120
you're not gonna have much
time for anything else.

37:08.145 --> 37:09.917
<i>Transition team report to O.R. 5.</i>

37:09.942 --> 37:13.924
Well, I mean, with work and...
and everything

37:13.949 --> 37:15.323
that's been going on with Annie...

37:15.348 --> 37:19.909
- Yeah, I mean, totally, right?
- Well, Jordan. Hey.

37:20.804 --> 37:23.931
Just until the dust settles, you know?

37:23.956 --> 37:27.222
I mean, I think we could both
use a little bit of a time-out.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.131
- Don't you think?
- 100%.

37:29.156 --> 37:30.620
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:30.797 --> 37:33.144
All right, good.
Well, I'm late to see Annie.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.120
- Okay, catch you later.
- Yeah.

37:40.397 --> 37:45.507
So... I went to the gift shop,
and I got something for ya.

37:47.067 --> 37:49.674
But I already have a phone...

37:49.843 --> 37:51.329
that was made in this decade.

37:51.354 --> 37:53.347
W... Yeah, yeah.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.777
Well, it's actually for me.
This is my dad phone.

37:56.801 --> 37:58.503
And you're the only caller.

37:58.528 --> 37:59.995
Wait, not even Rick?

38:00.020 --> 38:01.932
Nope. Just you.

38:01.957 --> 38:05.838
So whenever you're worried,
scared, anxious, whatever,

38:05.863 --> 38:08.796
I don't care, you call that phone,
and I'm gonna answer.

38:08.821 --> 38:10.388
I promise.

38:10.757 --> 38:13.026
Unless I'm hanging
from a roller coaster.

38:13.051 --> 38:15.362
- And then just leave a message.
- Okay.

38:15.401 --> 38:17.768
Give Cain a chance, Kenny.

38:17.793 --> 38:20.510
I can't, Mollie.
Got a bad feeling about the dude.

38:20.535 --> 38:23.009
That's just a taste
of your own medicine.

38:23.182 --> 38:27.065
No car payment, no rent, no
student loans. Are you high?

38:27.090 --> 38:28.724
I wanna be my own man, okay?

38:28.749 --> 38:30.268
I can't do that and take his money.

38:30.293 --> 38:32.518
Can I take his money?

38:33.939 --> 38:35.751
I'm proud of you, Paul.

38:35.776 --> 38:37.684
You beat your dad at his own game.

38:37.709 --> 38:39.343
I did, didn't I?

38:40.657 --> 38:43.112
Ugh, get a room.

38:43.137 --> 38:45.751
Hey, Jordan. I wanted to thank you.

38:45.776 --> 38:47.551
For what, chicken and waffles?

38:47.576 --> 38:49.682
Just give it a few hours.
You might change your mind.

38:49.707 --> 38:51.318
No, for giving me a chance.

38:51.343 --> 38:53.587
I didn't wake up today
thinking I'd be a doctor again.

38:53.612 --> 38:57.315
Oh. Well, I mean, like I said,
you're helping us out.

38:57.340 --> 38:59.190
We're taking advantage of you.

38:59.215 --> 39:02.089
Oh, yeah? Well... do it anytime.

39:02.241 --> 39:05.151
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan!
- I think you're being paged.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.693
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan!

39:07.718 --> 39:09.854
Jordan, Jordan!

39:09.879 --> 39:11.667
Good morning. Hi.

39:11.692 --> 39:17.291
Um, okay, so I will admit
that I had an ulterior motive

39:17.316 --> 39:19.885
for inviting you guys all out
here other than breakfast.

39:20.050 --> 39:24.487
I wanted to thank you, all of you,

39:24.512 --> 39:26.143
for hanging in there.

39:26.168 --> 39:31.377
I think it's been a rough 72 hours,
but we made it, right?

39:31.402 --> 39:32.735
- Right.
- Yeah!

39:32.760 --> 39:35.290
That's because we're family.

39:35.507 --> 39:39.104
So... let's raise a glass to
the best damn E.R. around.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.513
Jordan? Jordan.

39:44.538 --> 39:45.805
I need a minute.

39:45.830 --> 39:47.576
All right. Cheers.

39:47.601 --> 39:49.067
Cheers.

39:49.545 --> 39:51.342
- T.C.
- Yeah?

39:51.367 --> 39:53.490
Base commander asked me
to bring you a SAT phone.

39:53.515 --> 39:57.115
- You have a call from Texas.
- Texas? You're kidding.

39:58.992 --> 40:02.435
For an American,
you're tougher than I thought.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.460
I think you'll fit in here.

40:04.744 --> 40:07.162
I guess we'll find out.

40:10.421 --> 40:12.967
Just received this text
from our legal department.

40:12.992 --> 40:15.873
Oh, boy. Okay.

40:31.099 --> 40:34.717
Jordan, how's Annie?

40:34.955 --> 40:36.988
Why else would you be calling me?

40:37.013 --> 40:39.154
Everybody, um, I got some news here

40:39.179 --> 40:42.213
that... you all... might wanna hear.

40:42.238 --> 40:46.116
Um, at 9:37 last night,

40:46.141 --> 40:49.038
Dr. Christopher Zia
and his daughter, Lynn,

40:49.063 --> 40:51.097
were in a head-on collision
with a drunk driver

40:51.122 --> 40:52.881
on the Pacific Coast Highway.

40:52.906 --> 40:55.806
Topher?

40:56.445 --> 40:59.478
They were flown by chopper
to San Francisco General.

41:02.814 --> 41:05.004
There were no survivors.

41:13.026 --> 41:15.802
I'm sorry, T.C.
