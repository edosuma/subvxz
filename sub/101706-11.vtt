WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:03.351
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...She's dead.

00:03.394 --> 00:04.526
Whoa. What are you talking
about? Who's dead?

00:04.569 --> 00:05.701
Erika.

00:05.744 --> 00:06.789
<i>What happened, Chris?</i>

00:06.832 --> 00:07.833
<i>A bullet winged Tan,</i>

00:07.877 --> 00:08.834
<i>but Erika and I</i>

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
<i>brought him out safe.</i>

00:10.358 --> 00:12.838
I think I was hit, too.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.275
<i>We didn't know Erika got hit</i>

00:14.318 --> 00:15.189
<i>until just after.</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:18.018
Stop.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.063
She's gone.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.545
You sure you're ready
to retire?

00:23.588 --> 00:25.460
<i>I'm ready. Nikki and I</i>

00:25.503 --> 00:27.331
<i>got plans that don't include
me getting shot at anymore.</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:30.552
I'm proud to have
served this great city.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.771
Oh, brand-new Corvette.

00:32.815 --> 00:35.774
-Very nice.
-Told you clowns I was
getting out of here in style.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.559
I'll wave to you on the 405.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.438
Honestly, some days,
I don't even think about SWAT.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.223
Oh, please.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.790
You're either in denial, or
you're trying to pull my chain.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.444
There's nothing like
retirement, Bob.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.490
You should try it.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.100
I tell you I
took up hiking?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.363
After we get done with
this little project,

00:59.407 --> 01:01.191
I'm gonna hit
the Pacific Crest trail.

01:01.235 --> 01:04.107
Jack Mumford in the wilderness
for five months?

01:04.151 --> 01:05.674
You'd miss your
midlife crisis car too much.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.677
If you're really serious, don't
let this case slow you down.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.288
--It's been cold for five years.
-It ain't going anywhere.
-I'm not

01:11.332 --> 01:13.290
getting my hopes up, if that's
what you're worried about.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.814
Whether we find anything
or not, working with you

01:15.858 --> 01:19.296
Yeah, let's get out of here.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.432
The straw in the
water glass.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.520
Yeah, I saw it.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.697
Before the server gets it.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.394
I got it.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.399
Oh, great. Thank you.

01:44.408 --> 01:47.281
You notice the two
with him are carrying?

01:51.850 --> 01:53.113
I was thinking
about going shopping

01:53.156 --> 01:56.203
for socks this afternoon,
but now I'm thinking

01:56.246 --> 01:57.987
we should tail him.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.294
What do you say?

02:01.382 --> 02:02.948
Yeah.
Like it?

02:02.992 --> 02:05.168
I do. It's great.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.692
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.912
Hey!

02:09.955 --> 02:12.523
We were just
-talking about you.
-Oh, yeah?

02:12.567 --> 02:13.872
All good, I hope.

02:13.916 --> 02:14.743
Hmm.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.874
What's happening here?

02:15.918 --> 02:17.267
Why are you all suited
and booted, kid?

02:17.311 --> 02:18.660
And what's with
the papers?

02:18.703 --> 02:20.705
That's their
business plan.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.577
-Business plan?
I-I was gonna tell you.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.622
I was just waiting for
the perfect time. That's all.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.277
-Well, you got mereal interested now.
-Darryl and me--

02:27.321 --> 02:29.061
we're starting
a business together.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.628
Little father-and-son thing.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.196
I mean, for the betterment
of the community.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.284
Yeah, we're actually
pitching something to Nichelle

02:34.328 --> 02:36.156
to get some
of the start-up money

02:36.199 --> 02:37.461
that she's handing out.

02:37.505 --> 02:38.419
-From the funds donated
by Othella Baker?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.029
Oh, so you heard
about that, huh?

02:40.072 --> 02:41.422
Yeah, streets always hear
when someone's

02:41.465 --> 02:43.641
looking to improve things.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.689
It's so good that
you're doing this for people.

02:47.732 --> 02:51.693
Jobs give people hope, and
hope makes all things possible.

02:51.736 --> 02:52.998
There you go.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.174
What's this business idea?

02:54.217 --> 02:56.176
Auto repair shop.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.090
And you wrote up
a business plan already?

02:58.134 --> 03:00.528
-Yeah.
-Yeah, he put in a
whole lot of work, too.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.443
I got a real smart boy here.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.748
You ain't got
to tell me.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.838
Um, there's an Al-Anon
meeting in 30 minutes.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.450
I could use a
hand setting up.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.147
Darryl, why don't you go
help Nichelle?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.583
All right.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.718
An auto shop?

03:16.761 --> 03:18.546
Leroy, you throw a dime,
you'll hit

03:18.589 --> 03:20.852
-three of 'emin this neighborhood.
-We did our research.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.202
There ain't one like this one.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.421
We got a unique
selling point.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.729
We're gonna employ ex-cons,
give 'em a second chance.

03:27.772 --> 03:31.515
-Ex-cons?
-Reformed ex-cons, a'ight?

03:31.559 --> 03:32.864
Your girl gets it.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.911
She has a... a real
appreciation for our vision.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.434
Where you get the nerve to come
in here and talk to Nichelle?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.262
You're talking like
you're her man,

03:39.306 --> 03:41.351
but I-I thought
she was seeing some other dude.

03:41.395 --> 03:44.006
Watch yourself, Leroy.
I still care about that lady,

03:44.049 --> 03:45.442
and I don't appreciate
you seeking her out,

03:45.486 --> 03:47.052
trying to take advantage.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.880
Hey, we're just one of many

03:48.924 --> 03:50.839
throwing our hat in the ring
for some seed money.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.493
Nothing wrong with that.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.321
This Darryl's idea
or yours?

03:54.364 --> 03:57.237
You really think I'd pull my son
into something that ain't legit?

03:58.281 --> 04:01.806
I've been trying my damndest
to live straight,

04:01.850 --> 04:04.244
doing everything right, and
you still tossing shade at me,

04:04.287 --> 04:05.941
hating on it all, and you ain't

04:05.984 --> 04:08.335
-even heard it.
-I ain't hating on it or you.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.206
I'm just wondering what
you're dragging Darryl into.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.468
Dragging him?

04:11.512 --> 04:14.210
Now you better check yourself,
Hondo. Auto shop

04:14.254 --> 04:18.127
was his idea, after working with
your pops on cars all the time.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.998
Is everything good?

04:20.042 --> 04:21.348
Guys want to get something
to eat? I'm starving.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.001
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.133
You coming?

04:24.176 --> 04:26.440
Nah. Nah, not this time.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.093
All right.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.925
Thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.884
I'll be in touch once
we've made a decision.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.973
Cool.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.976
I'll call you later, Nichelle.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.196
Hey, Darryl?

04:44.240 --> 04:45.546
You really spent
a lot of time

04:45.589 --> 04:47.417
-on this business plan, huh?
-Months.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.636
My teacher at school helped me.

04:48.679 --> 04:49.767
Said it was one of the best
she'd ever seen.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.421
She even gave me
extra credit for it.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.249
Look, we have
this great USP,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.164
and I feel like we can be
profiting within six months,

04:55.207 --> 04:56.557
if we get the right
start-up funding.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.776
Whose idea was it to
ask Nichelle for that?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.952
My dad's.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.824
But it works, right?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
Look, I need
to start planning ahead.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.175
I need a little bank
for my future.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.438
Darryl, I thought you were
gonna go to college first.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.961
-What happened to that?
-Hondo, I need money now.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.789
I'm still trying
to get visitation with my son.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.922
I got lawyers to pay,
court fees.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.751
I need to be a part of Deon's
life before it's too late.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.449
Do you know how many businesses
fail in the first year?

05:19.493 --> 05:22.800
What happened to telling me
to dream big with my life, huh?

05:34.508 --> 05:36.597
It's been over ten minutes.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.643
Maybe we should go in.
It could be a robbery.

05:39.687 --> 05:42.603
You're retired,
I'm off-duty.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.605
I've already called it in
as suspicious activity.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.650
Unless we hear gunshots,
we're staying put,

05:46.694 --> 05:47.825
and we'll see what...

05:47.869 --> 05:49.349
Here they come.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.351
Trey Mitchell
and his two bodyguards.

05:56.704 --> 05:59.968
That ain't no robbery.
It's a pickup.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.710
-What do you think? Meth lab?
-Well, we'll know soon enough.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.539
Unis should be here any minute.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.376
Go!

06:19.901 --> 06:20.597
Sir,

06:20.641 --> 06:21.729
I'm a police officer.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.121
Drop the backpack

06:23.165 --> 06:25.385
on the ground
very slowly.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.735
-Hey! Stop!
-I got your six!

06:32.348 --> 06:34.263
Jack, down there.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.487
I have eyes on the suspect.
I'm doubling back!

06:40.530 --> 06:43.620
Freeze!

06:43.664 --> 06:45.666
Don't you move.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.413
Bob?!

06:57.155 --> 06:58.679
Must be fentanyl. Damn it.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.857
Give me your Narcan! Now!

07:50.644 --> 07:52.428
Commander.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.256
-Mumford.
Damn it.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.258
I told you not to call him.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.738
Sir, he didn't,
but I wish he had.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.914
My phone's been blowing up
with text messages about my boss

07:59.957 --> 08:01.742
in an off-hours incident
that landed him in the hospital.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.440
Well, as you can see,
I'm just fine.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.789
Turns out he can't
handle his fentanyl.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.271
Caught a snootful from a
lowlife street chemist.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.446
I shouldn't have been
close enough

08:10.490 --> 08:12.187
to get hit by the stuff.
Mental error.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.580
Okay, guys, I'm still in the
dark, here. Will one of y'all

08:13.623 --> 08:14.798
tell me what
the hell happened?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.278
You heard of the Echo Park Six?

08:16.321 --> 08:18.541
It was before my time on SWAT,
but yeah.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.456
Task force with the DEA.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.284
Y'all took down six heroin
distributors in one night.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.155
Kept 80 kilos off the street.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.287
And that was how many years ago?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.418
-Fifteen.
-So what, this is

08:26.462 --> 08:27.594
decades-old retribution?

08:27.637 --> 08:29.117
-Not exactly. The DEA wouldn't

08:29.160 --> 08:31.685
even have known about the
Echo Park Six if not for SWAT.

08:31.728 --> 08:32.903
One of my informantsgave us a lead.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.688
We shared the intel with DEA.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.559
I never heard that part.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.562
Not something I like
-to talk about.
Less than a week

08:39.606 --> 08:40.998
after we took down
the Echo Park Six,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.479
our informant was murdered.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.915
She wasa recovering addict.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.352
19 years old. Kid.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.920
They did her
with a hot shot.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.966
She was dead as soon
as the plunger was pushed.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.489
There was more battery acid

08:53.533 --> 08:55.056
than heroin in that syringe.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.318
There's a man's DNA

08:56.361 --> 08:58.799
all over the scene,matching DNA on a bottle

08:58.842 --> 09:00.931
of battery acid
we found in a dumpster nearby.

09:00.975 --> 09:04.239
And the DNA didn't match anybodyrelated to the Echo Park Six.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.980
Didn't even match anybody
in any database.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.983
Over the years, we check
back in from time to time.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.246
You hear how they caught the,
uh, Golden State Killer, right?

09:11.289 --> 09:13.117
Using online ancestry databases?

09:13.161 --> 09:14.815
You want to try thatto find this guy?

09:14.858 --> 09:16.251
Well, that
was Mumford's idea.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.818
He came to
me, he said

09:17.861 --> 09:19.471
"Maybe this is how
we can finally catch him."

09:19.515 --> 09:21.169
Nikki watches all
those true crime shows,

09:21.212 --> 09:22.953
put a worm in my ear.

09:22.997 --> 09:26.043
And, you know, I...I got some extra time right now.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.263
The closest probable match
we got was a fourth cousin.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.960
Which means a lot of possibles.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.528
Well, 34 justin the L.A. area, so,

09:32.572 --> 09:34.225
we started tracking 'em down
one by one

09:34.269 --> 09:36.314
-and collecting DNA samples.
-Well, if the guyyou were on today

09:36.358 --> 09:38.752
is slinging fentanyl, maybe
you already found your man.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.754
Well, only the DNA testcan tell us that for sure,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.060
but yeah, I mean,
we're thinking the same thing.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.149
Which would mean justice
for this girl.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.629
Tonya.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.109
Her name was Tonya.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.329
She wanted to get clean.

09:51.373 --> 09:55.595
Wanted to put the dealers
who hooked her in prison.

09:55.638 --> 09:59.337
I shouldn't have let her do it.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.818
She was a hell
of a softball player

10:01.862 --> 10:03.080
before the drugs took over.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.954
You knew her
before she was an informant?

10:06.997 --> 10:08.782
Yeah.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.873
She was my goddaughter.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.316
Sorry I got you out of bed.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.623
It's cool.
Don't worry.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.675
I told the bar owner
I was police,

10:32.719 --> 10:35.591
-and he still wouldn'tgive me the keys.
-I'm glad you called me.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.854
Wouldn't have been smart
to get behind a wheel.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.075
I wasn't gonna drive.
Just wanted my keys.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.772
How else am I gonna get
into the apartment?

10:42.816 --> 10:44.948
And I didn't start
that fight, either.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.037
Dude just grabbed my ass.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.256
I don't think he'll
try that again

10:48.299 --> 10:49.344
after you put him on the floor.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.911
[chuckles]
Got to say,

10:50.954 --> 10:52.913
I was surprised you called me,
not Street.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.655
He's got enough to handle
with Molly and-and the breakup.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.179
Oh, you don't need
to do that.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.354
It's a mess. Uh...

10:59.397 --> 11:03.053
I-I just haven't
had time to...

11:03.097 --> 11:05.621
-You know?
-Your eye looks real nasty.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.754
Let me get you some ice.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.975
It was for the housewarming.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.893
It's late.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.939
You don't have to stay.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.856
Hey, Chris?

11:23.987 --> 11:25.728
Should I be worried?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.904
-I'm fine.
-You know, it's okay
not to be okay.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.906
Erika's only been gone
for a few weeks.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.778
I said I'm fine.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.171
I won the T.L.I. competition,
didn't I?

11:34.215 --> 11:36.434
Okay, so, what I need is sleep.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.914
You still talking to Dr. Wendy?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.437
She signed off on me.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.962
-I'm clear for duty.
-Yeah, I know.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.311
Are you still talking to her?

11:43.354 --> 11:45.182
Maybe it's a good idea.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.271
You were living with Erika,
and loss is a process.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.056
I'm dealing with it.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.927
One shot at a time? Bar fights?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.276
Like I've never seen
you drunk before?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.800
Not on a school night.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.674
Look, take tomorrow off.
Get some rest.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.284
I'll come by after. We
can chat a little more.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.939
I'll help you clean up,
too, okay?

12:02.983 --> 12:04.680
Hey, Tan?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.075
Don't tell anyone, okay?

12:15.343 --> 12:16.866
<i>What's up, Mumford?</i>

12:18.259 --> 12:20.217
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.045
No, I'm-I'm sorry. I-I forgot.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.830
I will. I'll-I'll figure
something out.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.962
Okay. All right.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.094
Love you, too. Bye.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.312
Hey, Mumford.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.749
Heard about yesterday.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.098
Hope you didn't pull
any muscles.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.970
No, I'm golden.
But from the sound

12:34.014 --> 12:35.232
of that conversation,

12:35.276 --> 12:36.364
looks like you're the one
with the problems.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.974
-Annie giving you grief?
-No, no.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.064
It's just I-I promised
that I'd come up

12:41.108 --> 12:44.111
with a donation for the silent
auction at Lila's new school,

12:44.154 --> 12:46.113
and, uh, the deadline
was today. I forgot.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.549
Yeah,
that fancy-pants place.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.898
How you liking
those tuition fees?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.032
My biggest problem right
now is trying to find

12:52.075 --> 12:54.034
something impressive
enough to sit alongside

12:54.077 --> 12:57.037
a weeklong stay
at a fancy villa in Cabo,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.169
a sunset cruise
on a yacht, oh,

12:59.213 --> 13:01.302
and a behind-the-scenes look
at SpaceX.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.521
So, I guess a tour
of L.A. crime scenes

13:03.565 --> 13:05.523
from the back of a patrol
-car is not gonna cut it?
-No.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.264
If I don't come up
with something soon,

13:07.308 --> 13:09.919
Annie's gonna...
Well, she'll be displeased.

13:09.963 --> 13:13.009
Never make promises
to your wife you can't keep.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.358
That's what I learned.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.230
You've been married four times.

13:16.273 --> 13:19.407
I didn't learn it right away.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.542
Thought you were
taking today off.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.718
Decided not to. I'm good.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.981
You sure?

13:29.069 --> 13:30.984
Morning.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.333
What happened to you?

13:32.376 --> 13:33.900
Unpacking the last
of the boxes last night.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.902
I put a blender on a shelf,
and it fell.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.512
Was it set on crush mode?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.906
You should see the blender.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.344
A blender fell on her?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.998
How are things with Molly?

13:45.041 --> 13:47.914
She doing okay?
I don't know, man.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.437
Haven't spoken
since the breakup.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.786
Hicks know about it yet?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.744
Molly must've told him
about it by now, right?

13:52.788 --> 13:54.746
Nah. If he knew,
you'd for sure be

13:54.790 --> 13:56.226
on armory duty
for the next year.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.488
Anyway,

13:57.532 --> 13:58.750
think the commander's
a little preoccupied

13:58.794 --> 14:00.665
right now
after his brush with death.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.929
-What?
-You got to start reading
your texts, dude.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.452
That's why Mumford's here.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.064
Mumford.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.197
Hey. Still got
your head on a swivel, kid?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.503
-Yeah, we keep him in line.
-Some lessons

14:12.547 --> 14:14.505
you never forget. You mind
if I borrow Deac real quick?

14:14.549 --> 14:15.811
No problem. I have

14:15.855 --> 14:17.944
important investigative business
to attend to.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.947
What's up?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.600
<i>I can't tell</i>

14:22.644 --> 14:24.211
whether you're questioning
my judgment

14:24.254 --> 14:25.516
or just my authority.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.388
But either way,
you're pissing me off.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.824
-It's neither one.
-Sir,

14:28.868 --> 14:32.088
Street came to me expressing
his concern about Mumford.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.090
Turns out
it's a concern I share.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.657
That's why
we're coming to you.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.093
I saw Buck a few weeks ago.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.399
He mentioned Mumford's

14:38.442 --> 14:40.053
been calling him
a lot more than usual.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.358
Talking about old cases.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.794
Rocker's told me
that over the last year,

14:42.838 --> 14:45.232
Mumford's hit him up
more than once,

14:45.275 --> 14:47.974
seeing if he can consult
on raids.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.149
Well, maybe he's just bored.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.367
Or maybe it's more than that.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.108
Buck said he seemed more,

14:52.152 --> 14:53.544
uh, sentimental than usual.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.285
He said he was worried
about him, and that's...

14:55.329 --> 14:56.765
that's Buck saying that.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.985
I've spent hours at a time
on stakeouts with Mumford.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.639
If he was feeling desperate
for something to live for,

15:01.683 --> 15:03.990
I think I would've noticed.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.644
Sir,

15:06.688 --> 15:08.646
some people hide it really well.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.953
I don't think this is
about anything more for Mumford

15:10.997 --> 15:13.477
than nailing the guy
that killed his goddaughter.

15:13.521 --> 15:17.003
I appreciate your concern for
a retired brother in blue.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.528
I'll keep an eye on him.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.964
We done?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.624
After an hour
of going through mugshots,

15:29.667 --> 15:32.932
these are the guys we saw
with Trey Mitchell yesterday.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.194
Nestor and Adrian Hitzges.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.891
Never heard of 'em."Bulletproof Boys,"

15:35.935 --> 15:38.024
aka "Badass Incorporated,"

15:38.067 --> 15:41.027
aka "Brothers Grim."
One "M" in Grim.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.332
Sounds like they need
to settle on a nickname.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.334
Hired muscle for everyone

15:44.378 --> 15:47.642
from snatch-and-grab crews
to drug operations like Trey's.

15:47.685 --> 15:48.817
Do we know where they're at now?

15:48.860 --> 15:50.036
Skipped parole a year ago.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.081
Fake plates
on the car we saw yesterday.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.256
I got Tan looking through

15:53.300 --> 15:54.997
the DEA's findings
from the warehouse.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.391
There's a chance we might
pick up a lead from that.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.045
I worked up a dossier
on Trey Mitchell

15:59.088 --> 16:00.176
if you want to see it.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.615
-You put all this togethersince last night?
-Actually,

16:04.659 --> 16:07.140
I put it together on all 34
suspects when we started this.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.619
-Right?
Sounds like you ought to come

16:08.663 --> 16:10.012
out of retirement
to be a detective, Mumford.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.144
You kidding, right?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.015
As soon as we nail this guy,

16:13.059 --> 16:14.582
I'm going back
to sleeping till 10:00

16:14.625 --> 16:18.151
and long drives up the PCH
in the convertible with my lady.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.892
Well, looks like Trey's
got quite the imprint

16:20.936 --> 16:22.068
-on social media.
Cars.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.939
Women. Jewelry.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.636
Tell him his cover story
for how he affords

16:25.680 --> 16:28.074
-that kind of lifestyle.
-Positive thinking.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.945
No joke.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.381
Some reference to real
estate investments,

16:31.425 --> 16:33.340
but mostly
positive thinking.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.429
Well, he's got to be
laundering his drug money

16:35.472 --> 16:37.126
through something.
We'll look into it.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.736
You didn't find
any connection between Trey

16:38.780 --> 16:40.956
-and your goddaughter, Tonya?
-No.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.828
Nothing pointed to Trey Mitchell
being the guy until yesterday.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.178
Which I assume

16:45.221 --> 16:47.049
is why you had us look
at 22 other guys first.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.660
Trust me, if I knew that
Mitchell was doing dirt,

16:49.704 --> 16:51.184
I'd have put him
at number one.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.446
Not that I don't like
your company,

16:52.489 --> 16:55.057
Bob, but this ass
wasn't made for stakeouts.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.711
Duly noted.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.975
-What do you got?
-The DEA sent over

17:00.019 --> 17:02.064
some good intel on what
Trey Mitchell might be up to.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.370
Based on what they found
at the warehouse,

17:03.413 --> 17:05.676
they're definitely using it
as a drug lab,

17:05.720 --> 17:07.200
but they're not making fentanyl
like we thought.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.941
They're using fentanyl
to make fake oxycodone.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.247
The painkiller?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.944
That can't be good.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.250
It's a lot worse
than it sounds.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.209
A lot of O.D.s, a
lot of deaths.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.472
Now, an oxy and a
hit of fentanyl are two
different universes.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.952
Now, these people aren't
hardcore drug users.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.215
They're people
who lost their health insurance,

17:22.258 --> 17:24.173
and they're stuck
buying their meds illegally

17:24.217 --> 17:26.480
-from people like Trey Mitchell.
-Sounds like we got to
find these fake oxys

17:26.523 --> 17:28.221
before Mitchell puts
them out on the street.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.657
I'll talk to the commander.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.572
Good work.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.228
-The DNA came back
off that drinking straw.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.231
Trey Mitchell's a match to
the syringe that killed Tonya.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
We finally got him, Jack.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.973
Only took 15 years.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.106
You got to let me come with
you when you pick him up.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.760
We're not picking anyone up yet.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.762
-What?
-Turns out Trey Mitchell is

17:47.805 --> 17:50.112
making fake prescription drugs
laced with fentanyl.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.505
Putting him
under surveillance.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.115
That's the best chance we have
of finding these pills

17:53.159 --> 17:54.986
before they get out to dealers
and unsuspecting customers.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.989
-Offer him a deal if he tells youwhere the pills are.
-You really want

17:58.033 --> 18:00.383
the D.A. offering
Tonya's murderer a deal?

18:00.427 --> 18:03.430
-'Cause Isure as hell don't.
-Bob, we got him.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.172
Put the cuffs on and
-sort it out after.
-No, I'm sorry, Jack.

18:06.215 --> 18:09.044
There could be dozens of O.D.s,
and I'm not letting that happen.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.307
Nobody goes
near Trey Mitchell

18:11.351 --> 18:14.005
until we find those pills.
Understood?

18:15.006 --> 18:15.964
Yeah.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.313
I understand.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.794
What are we doing
to find those drugs fast?

18:19.837 --> 18:21.317
Everything we can.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.249
-Hey. Thanks for stopping by.
-Hey.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.164
Sure. I'm on call,

18:42.208 --> 18:44.123
but I figured
it must be important.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.516
I'm guessing you want to talk
about Darryl and Leroy.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.952
Nichelle, look, I'm sorry.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.519
I-I would've warned you
if I had known

18:49.563 --> 18:51.347
that Leroy was gonna come
-knocking on your door.
-Yeah.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.436
Sorry you weren't
in the loop on that.

18:53.480 --> 18:57.919
But the truth is
Darryl's proposal is good.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.008
Really good. I'm leaning

19:00.051 --> 19:01.879
towards giving them the money.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.099
Don't be doing this
-as some type of favor to me.
-I'm not.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.710
They've done their homework,
and they were very convincing.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.234
But I need

19:08.277 --> 19:10.236
to pick people
who I believe can deliver.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.716
And while I have faith
in Darryl...

19:12.760 --> 19:14.240
You're asking me
if you can trust Leroy.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.548
He says he's a changed man.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.551
And for Darryl's sake, I really,
really want to believe that.

19:21.595 --> 19:25.033
Then maybe someone should
give him a chance to prove it.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.907
If this was just about Leroy,
I'd be down for that.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.127
And sure, I got my doubts.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.868
As long as I've known him,

19:33.911 --> 19:36.566
Leroy has always been drawn
to the action.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.873
But, end of the day,

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
if you say you believe
in rehabilitation,

19:40.744 --> 19:42.877
then you got to walk the talk.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.966
It's just my only concern...

19:45.009 --> 19:46.359
-Darryl.
-Yes.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.838
I just had all these hopes
for him

19:47.882 --> 19:48.883
after everything
he's gone through.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.232
I mean, this whole time,

19:50.276 --> 19:51.581
I've just been trying
to broaden his horizons

19:51.625 --> 19:53.975
and make him see
that he has possibilities.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.804
But lately, I don't know.
It just...

19:56.847 --> 19:58.849
feels like
he's been ignoring me.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.721
Remind me,
didn't you tell your father

20:00.764 --> 20:01.896
you were ditching out on college

20:01.939 --> 20:04.159
to join the Marines?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.726
Touché.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.599
I'm not sure he wasn't right,
though, looking back.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.906
Now, he can never know
I just said that.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.908
-I would never hearthe end of it.
-Your secret's safe with me.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.867
Thank you.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.869
Would you mind
giving me a heads-up

20:18.913 --> 20:20.262
when you decide about the money?

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
Still got some thinking to do,

20:22.308 --> 20:24.788
so yeah, sure.
I'll let you know first.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.790
Thank you.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.271
<i>I mean, the guy's
always bragging</i>

20:29.315 --> 20:30.925
on social media about
investing in real estate.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.100
So he might be using

20:32.143 --> 20:33.188
an investment property
as a stash house.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.755
Yeah, I'm working on it.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.410
It's worth a shot, right? Now,
I'm-I'm no computer whiz kid,

20:37.453 --> 20:40.239
but if you put upanother screen, I could ...m on it, Mumford.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.632
Right.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.641
You know, I never saw
anybody use this chessboard.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
Still working
on that silent auction thing?

20:54.340 --> 20:57.081
Annie keeps sending me reminders
every five minutes.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.910
What about tickets to something?
Like a basketball game.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.825
One of the parents
at this school

21:01.869 --> 21:03.436
owns an NBA team.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.047
Think I got to tell her
I struck out.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.050
Well, I hope the cot in the
spare bedroom is comfortable.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.399
We've got four kids.
I don't have a spare bedroom.

21:10.443 --> 21:11.879
Hey, think
I might have found something.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.794
Look, several of the boxes
they were storing chemicals in

21:13.837 --> 21:15.491
were for kids' toys.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.059
It's playground equipment. Too
much of it to be a coincidence.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.540
Think these are thingshe personally ordered?
-Trey Mitchell

21:20.583 --> 21:22.498
or the street chemist that
kicked fentanyl in Hicks' face.

21:22.542 --> 21:23.978
If they are, we can
trace the labels

21:24.021 --> 21:25.022
and see where they were shipped.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.720
Might even be
the stash house

21:26.763 --> 21:28.548
where they're keeping the pills.
Then we put that bastard

21:28.591 --> 21:30.114
-Trey Mitchell in cuffs.
-We might not even need

21:30.158 --> 21:31.725
to trace shipping labels.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.161
Trey Mitchell's part owner
of an indoor playground

21:33.204 --> 21:36.469
called Jub Jub's Fun Factory.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.601
Looks like one of those
giant petri dishes full

21:38.645 --> 21:39.733
of trampolinesand foam castles

21:39.776 --> 21:40.864
my kids are always begging

21:40.908 --> 21:41.996
to have their birthdays at.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.432
Just the kind of place
that might place

21:43.476 --> 21:44.868
a large order
of playground equipment.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.740
Look at this.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.002
That's a pretty strong
revenue stream.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.090
Yeah, but
only three

21:49.133 --> 21:51.048
online reviews--
all very negative--

21:51.092 --> 21:52.876
say the place
is hardly ever actually open.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.052
Trey Mitchell is using this
place to launder his money.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.794
Hell, it might even
be the stash house.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.275
What are you two mooks
waiting for? Let's go.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.585
-What do you mean no?
-You were always gonna have

22:05.628 --> 22:08.544
to give up the reins
at some point. You knew that.

22:08.588 --> 22:09.850
I'm not asking
to be first through the door.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.156
I just want to see
this thing through to the end.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.549
And when we march
Trey Mitchell in here,

22:13.593 --> 22:15.508
I'll make sure
you have a front row seat.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.379
But until we
do that, we got

22:17.423 --> 22:19.163
to track down these drugs.
And there's no reason

22:19.207 --> 22:20.556
for you to be
involved in that.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.298
Involving a civilian,
even a retired SWAT officer,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.300
could jeopardize
the whole prosecution.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.301
You know that.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.955
Tonya was my goddaughter.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.913
I'm the one who let her be
an informant.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.176
And I'm the one
that signed off on it.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.877
Look...

22:36.920 --> 22:38.879
we both spent the
last 15 years wondering

22:38.922 --> 22:40.881
if we put Tonya in
unnecessary danger.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.404
After yesterday,

22:42.448 --> 22:44.972
I'm not risking putting you
in danger the same way.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.802
Wasn't me who had
to get Narcan shoved up my nose.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.158
I'll let you know what I find.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.945
No problem.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.208
Got plenty of things
to do with my day.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.472
Sorry to be so much trouble.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.521
Hey, what's up, big man?

23:12.565 --> 23:15.829
I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.004
What's your name?

23:17.047 --> 23:19.006
Theo.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.486
You sure about that? You
seem a little uncertain.

23:20.529 --> 23:21.965
Anyone else here?

23:22.009 --> 23:24.446
What about Jub Jub?
Jub Jub here? This is

23:24.490 --> 23:26.405
Jub Jub's Fun Factory,
is it not?

23:26.448 --> 23:27.884
How 'bout Trey Mitchell?

23:27.928 --> 23:28.929
He ever come around?

23:28.972 --> 23:31.279
I don't think
you can come in here.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.455
It's during business hours
and door's unlocked.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.978
Yeah. And if that's
not good enough for you,

23:35.022 --> 23:36.153
we got a warrant.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.242
You don't mind if we
look around, right?

23:38.286 --> 23:41.071
Yo, Theo,
you ran out of toilet paper.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.426
-They never learn.
-Street, get the kid!10-4.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.992
20-David to patrol,
we got a runner!

23:49.036 --> 23:50.254
Might be coming your way.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.386
We got all
exits covered!

23:51.430 --> 23:52.996
Give yourself up!

23:53.040 --> 23:54.650
Didn't look like he was armed.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.173
-Might have weapons hidden.
-If they're using this place

23:56.217 --> 23:57.827
as a lab like they were
with that warehouse,

23:57.871 --> 23:59.655
there could be fentanyl around,
too. Be careful.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.702
I'm hitting
the lights.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.011
Chris, Tan,
cover the three-four side.

24:08.055 --> 24:10.100
Move. Deacon, you're with me.

24:11.711 --> 24:14.017
Go.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.542
Two, two, two.

24:16.585 --> 24:17.673
Left side clear.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.936
Right side clear.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.215
I think he's in there.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.043
Hold up, hold up.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.218
We'll be totally exposed.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.351
Got you covered.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.878
Fine. You cover me.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.373
Hondo,
I think we got him.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.722
-Northwest corner.
-Copy.

25:06.766 --> 25:07.767
Headed your way.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.909
-He's on the move.
-We're on him!

25:22.912 --> 25:24.958
Give it up!

25:29.310 --> 25:30.354
Stop!

25:39.929 --> 25:42.236
This is everything we kept.

25:42.279 --> 25:45.761
You probably looked through it
all back when Tonya passed.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.938
Just hoping
to find something I didn't know

25:48.982 --> 25:50.636
to look for back then.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.291
There's a new lead
you're following up on.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.684
Might be something.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.338
Might be nothing.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.864
Was Tonya ever tight
with somebody named Trey?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.431
Would've been
a few years older.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.956
Yes. She went on a few dates
with a boy named Trey, but...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.698
that was years before she died.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.787
You think
he's involved?

26:14.181 --> 26:16.313
I don't want to get
your hopes up, Mary Beth.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.794
-It's just a leadI'm helping to follow up on.
-Jack, it's me.

26:18.838 --> 26:22.145
Don't treat me like I'm some
stranger you have to lie to.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.321
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I-I d-- This is...

26:24.365 --> 26:26.410
Difficult.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.325
I know.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.023
Of course you do.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.158
I'm helping Bob Hicks
follow up on some new leads.

26:35.202 --> 26:38.727
The DNA suggests
that this guy Trey

26:38.771 --> 26:40.903
is the one who killed Tonya.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.339
Bob can't arrest him.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.993
He's got some people
following him,

26:44.037 --> 26:46.126
hoping to catch Trey in some
ongoing criminal activities.

26:46.169 --> 26:50.347
But if it's the same Trey
that you're saying dated Tonya,

26:50.391 --> 26:54.134
maybe you know something
that can help us speed this up.

26:54.177 --> 26:57.137
They only went on
a couple of dates.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.227
I never even
actually met him.

27:00.270 --> 27:03.230
That's why I never mentioned
him to you back then.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.840
I only remembered
the name

27:04.884 --> 27:06.929
because of a shouting
match I had with Tonya

27:06.973 --> 27:08.844
when I told her never
to see him again.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.890
Why didn't you want
Tonya dating him again?

27:10.933 --> 27:13.066
He was too old for
her, for one thing.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.938
He would pull up in his
stupidly loud sports car

27:15.982 --> 27:17.026
and honk his horn.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.375
Wouldn't even
come to the door.

27:18.419 --> 27:21.248
Well, we found pictures
of her in his apartment,

27:21.291 --> 27:24.947
wearing his gold chain
like she was his property.

27:26.906 --> 27:30.126
A boy in his 20s with
a beachfront condo.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.347
You think she kept seeing him
behind your back?

27:33.390 --> 27:36.567
Yes. Very possible.

27:36.611 --> 27:40.876
It was about that time the drugs
started getting really bad.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.183
Those next two years
were just...

27:44.445 --> 27:46.403
Well...

27:46.447 --> 27:47.883
you were right there with us.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.276
You remember.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.279
Yeah. That was rough.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.237
I'm sorry Clark
couldn't be here.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.022
He had some
errands to run.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.894
It's o-- it's okay. I-I...

27:58.938 --> 28:00.417
I know he blames me.

28:00.461 --> 28:03.899
If I were him, I'd find
some errands to run, too.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.772
You said
this guy Trey had a...

28:06.815 --> 28:09.296
beachfront condo.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.428
You still have
those photos you mentioned?

28:11.472 --> 28:14.954
They'd be somewhere in the box.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.913
Remember me?

28:19.959 --> 28:21.438
Is that the guy?

28:21.482 --> 28:22.526
Yeah, that's him.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.311
-You find those fake oxys?
-Nothing yet.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.313
K-9 unit's on its way,
but I don't think the stuff

28:26.356 --> 28:28.924
-is stashed here.
-They're definitely setting this
place up to be their new lab.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.970
So far, it's just equipment,
chemicals.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.449
No fentanyl, no pills.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.450
Check out
the guy's phone.

28:33.494 --> 28:34.582
He was texting
when we found him.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.062
Several numbers,
but it's all nonsense.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.367
Got to be some kind of code.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.195
Probably connected to
the bad news I just got.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.807
-Bad news?
-Trey Mitchell
just shook his tail.

28:41.850 --> 28:42.938
Tell me you're joking.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.940
Oh, it gets worse.
DEA's lab called.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.942
Based on the evidence from
the warehouse yesterday,

28:46.986 --> 28:48.814
Trey's chemist has no
idea what he's doing.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.032
He cut the
pills so strong

28:50.076 --> 28:51.468
that it could kill
even hardcore users.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.383
We're talking a
50% mortality rate

28:53.427 --> 28:55.081
-or worse.
-That's hundreds

28:55.124 --> 28:56.386
-of people O.D.'ing.
-Yeah.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.040
We got to find those pills.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.832
I thought I made myself clear.

29:06.875 --> 29:10.444
Mumford was to have no further
involvement in this case.

29:10.487 --> 29:11.880
And we haven't shared
information with him since then.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.534
But, sir, when you stopped
responding to his calls,

29:13.577 --> 29:16.842
Mumford hit us up with intel
I think you should hear.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.887
All right. Bring him in.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.109
Mumford.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.417
All right, what do you got?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.725
Mary Beth gave me
this photo of Tonya

29:30.769 --> 29:33.728
at a beachfront condo
supposedly owned by Trey.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.556
Only Tan and I did
a workup on him.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.863
The guy's never owned
or rented a place at the beach

29:37.906 --> 29:39.821
his whole life.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.475
-Cut to it.
-Based on

29:41.518 --> 29:43.564
the lifeguard stand
in the photo, I...

29:43.607 --> 29:45.784
figured out
exactly where the condo is.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.046
Tan traced
the ownership

29:47.089 --> 29:49.613
to a shell corporation
hidden behind some LLC.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.877
Blah, blah, blah.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.879
Point is,

29:53.922 --> 29:56.577
Trey owns a lot of places,

29:56.620 --> 29:58.057
including that condo,

29:58.100 --> 29:59.754
and none of 'em
have his name on 'em.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.974
-Eight propertiesin L.A.
-Trey Mitchell's

30:02.017 --> 30:03.976
probably hiding out at
one of 'em with the drugs.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.804
Not only that. If you follow
the trail back far enough,

30:05.847 --> 30:07.849
these hidden companies of Trey's
connect up to members

30:07.893 --> 30:09.459
of the Echo Park Six.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.157
Which gives him a pure
motive for killing Tonya.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.594
Commander, it would've taken us
days if Mumford hadn't gotten us

30:13.637 --> 30:15.639
a head start by
finding that condo.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.164
Thank you, Sergeant.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.470
You're excused.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.821
Hold on a
second, Jack.

30:26.781 --> 30:27.826
That's good work.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.828
Thanks.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.962
I probably shouldn't have left
the way I did earlier.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.181
Ah...

30:35.224 --> 30:38.880
I know... you have
to play it a certain way.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.926
I could've been a touch
more understanding, too.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.144
Look,
just so you know,

30:42.188 --> 30:45.147
I'm not trying
to get back in again.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.845
I'm staying retired.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.542
I love being with Nikki.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.892
You know, she's built
a whole life for herself.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.808
Some friends that she hangs out
with, b-book club,

30:53.852 --> 30:55.723
-whatever.
-Yeah.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.246
Guys like us?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.860
The job <i>is</i> our life.

31:01.903 --> 31:02.991
Yeah.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.689
I get it.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.608
I guess I just miss my friends.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.617
Don't you dare
tell anybody I said that.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.013
We got to talk.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.797
Yeah, we do.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.148
Why'd you question
my call back there?

31:29.191 --> 31:31.019
You know
what being on SWAT means.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.325
I'll always have
your back, Chris.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.936
But I need to know
you're able to have mine.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.590
I can't be going out
in the field worrying

31:36.633 --> 31:38.592
-you might be operatingat half speed.
-Is this about earlier

31:38.635 --> 31:40.681
with the takedown,
or is this about Erika?

31:40.724 --> 31:42.248
What are you even talking about?
This has nothing to do

31:42.291 --> 31:43.336
with Erika.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.598
Oh, you think I'm blaming you

31:44.641 --> 31:45.642
for what happened to her?

31:45.686 --> 31:46.992
Chris, you know what happened

31:47.035 --> 31:49.124
to Erika wasn't
your fault, right?

31:49.168 --> 31:50.909
She was there
because of me.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.606
No, no, no, she was there

31:52.649 --> 31:55.261
'cause she chose to be
there, she wanted to be.

31:55.304 --> 31:58.220
And what happened to Erika could
have happened to any one of us.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.352
And it's no one's
fault that she died

31:59.395 --> 32:01.223
but the person who
pulled that trigger.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.877
Hey, Chris, you got
to get on top of this.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.227
I've seen the way
that grief eats people up.

32:07.142 --> 32:12.713
Look... when my dad
died, I lost it.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.323
I didn't know
how to deal.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.021
He had a heart attack.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.718
They pulled me out
of class to tell me.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.938
I'm sorry.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.244
And for the longest
time, I wasn't sad.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.333
I didn't even cry.

32:24.377 --> 32:27.728
I was just... I was mad.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.904
I was punching-the-walls mad.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.125
And when the anger finally
gave way, I still didn't cry.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.997
I just... I didn't
feel anything.

32:36.041 --> 32:39.044
I wouldn't get out of bed,
I wouldn't go to school.

32:39.087 --> 32:42.612
And after two months of
this, my best friend--

32:42.656 --> 32:45.224
he finally dragged me out of
the house, he took me surfing.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.748
And there was just
something about,

32:47.791 --> 32:50.055
you know, being out
on the water that...

32:50.098 --> 32:52.753
that helped me start to
process what had happened.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.798
I was finally
able to grieve.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.760
Look, I know surfing's
not your thing, but...

32:59.803 --> 33:01.936
how about getting
in the ring?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.852
That's your usual go-to,
right, to let off steam?

33:04.895 --> 33:07.115
Want to work off some
of that anger on me?

33:07.159 --> 33:09.944
Not some random Joes at a bar?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.381
Yeah.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.209
<i>So, why am I here?</i>

33:14.253 --> 33:16.385
I already told you
I got nothing to say.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.999
Hey, wait a minute.
He's not supposed be in here!

33:21.042 --> 33:24.828
Shut up! I'm in charge of
everyone in this building.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.483
You kicked fentanyl in
the wrong person's face, Ernie.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.008
I want to leave this roomright...
I said shut up!

33:30.051 --> 33:32.271
I'm not in here
to cut the cameras off

33:32.314 --> 33:34.012
and tell the judge,
"Well, he must've tripped

33:34.055 --> 33:35.535
and fell, Your Honor."

33:35.578 --> 33:37.145
That's not how
I run things.

33:37.189 --> 33:39.278
But you tried
to kill a police officer,

33:39.321 --> 33:41.802
so I'm not cutting you
any deals, either.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.893
So, I need your
opinion on something.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.764
What should I wear
to your hearing?

33:47.808 --> 33:49.592
What?

33:49.636 --> 33:52.639
You're gonna plead guilty
and throw yourself

33:52.682 --> 33:54.554
on the mercy of the court,
and I'm gonna

33:54.597 --> 33:56.643
testify at your
sentencing hearing.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.994
So... what should I wear?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.083
Now, I could go with
my full blue uniform

34:02.127 --> 34:04.172
with the badge, the gun,
you know, the works.

34:04.216 --> 34:08.916
Remind the judge I'm a cop
who can handle himself.

34:08.959 --> 34:13.964
Or maybe I go with the-- I don't
know-- old-man sweater, Dockers,

34:14.008 --> 34:16.358
maybe buy a pair of
those padded black shoes

34:16.402 --> 34:18.708
you see old folks
shuffling around in.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.668
Give everyone the feeling
that you tried to kill a guy

34:21.711 --> 34:24.105
who reminds them of
their dear old Pappy,

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
may he rest in peace.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.675
Now, whichever
one I decide on

34:28.718 --> 34:30.068
depends entirely on whether

34:30.111 --> 34:31.939
you tell me where
those drugs are at.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.202
What if they moved it
after I got arrested?

34:34.246 --> 34:37.075
Then I'll be shopping for Mr.
Rogers sweaters tomorrow. Yeah.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.207
And how do I know
you'll hold up your end, huh?

34:39.251 --> 34:42.123
I guess you'll have to risk it.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.212
Just like you and
Trey's customers

34:44.256 --> 34:47.085
are risking their lives
when they buy your fake oxy.

34:47.128 --> 34:50.218
Either way, you're
better off cooperating.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.699
Because if those
pills hit the street,

34:52.742 --> 34:56.355
I'll make sure you're charged
with murder one for every O.D.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.155
No one without
hazmat goes in until

35:14.199 --> 35:15.809
20-David gives the all-clear.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.246
I don't see why 50-Squad
can't go in first.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.118
Just looking out
for my boy Rocker.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.121
Special access to the
situation room can be revoked

35:23.164 --> 35:24.774
at any time, you know.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.084
Chris and Tan,
cover the front.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.086
50-Squad's got the back door.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.783
Let's move.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.356
LAPD! Hands!

35:41.400 --> 35:43.315
Let me see your hands.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.012
Down on the ground.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.754
You really want bullets
flying around in here, man?

35:47.797 --> 35:49.190
I said on the ground.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.192
A lot of fentanyl here,
but I don't see any pills.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.280
That vest ain't
gonna do you no good

35:52.324 --> 35:53.455
when you're covered
in that poison.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.848
Now get down.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.807
Down! Keep your hands
behind your head.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.418
Your brother and Trey Mitchell--
where are they hiding?

35:59.461 --> 36:00.854
They're in Mexico by now, bro.

36:00.897 --> 36:03.509
-They're what?
-Left with the
pills hours ago.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.039
If Trey and your brother already
left, then why are you

36:12.082 --> 36:14.781
-still here?
-Couldn't fit all
this fentanyl in the car.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.739
Got a friend coming
-with another truck.
-Impossible.

36:16.783 --> 36:17.740
Surveillance saw
all three enter,

36:17.784 --> 36:19.046
and none of them left.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.090
Wouldn't be the first time
he beat surveillance.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.396
Oh, so they went to Mexico

36:21.440 --> 36:22.789
to compete with the cartel
on their own turf?

36:22.832 --> 36:24.399
You think I'm buyingany of this?

36:24.443 --> 36:26.967
--You hear that?
-They're in the garage.
-Street, stay on him.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.229
Deacon, move.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.033
Don't you move.

36:55.517 --> 36:58.259
Got the pills.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.608
Perfect.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.131
Come on now, Trey.

37:01.175 --> 37:03.090
It's time
to get you patched up.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.005
Some friends of mine
been waiting a long time

37:05.048 --> 37:07.094
to see you take
a special walk.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.104
Left jab. Right cross.

37:17.147 --> 37:18.888
One, two, one,
two. That's it.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.194
Let's go. Keep
it coming.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.935
Bye, Deac.

37:21.978 --> 37:24.764
Come on.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.772
Hey, Deac.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.991
I got a great idea
for the silent auction.

37:35.035 --> 37:37.385
Civilians love
playing detective, right?

37:37.429 --> 37:39.518
I mean, you should see
the way these people go crazy

37:39.561 --> 37:41.824
for those true crime shows
that Nikki watches.

37:41.868 --> 37:47.177
So, we give these rich parents
a chance to work a pretend case.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.832
We set up a fake crime
scene, we let 'em do all

37:49.876 --> 37:51.443
the detective work,
they interview suspects...

37:51.486 --> 37:53.009
Uh, yeah, it's a great idea,

37:53.053 --> 37:55.011
but I-I don't have time
to organize all that.

37:55.055 --> 37:58.537
-Guess who does?
-Really?

37:58.580 --> 38:00.408
You'd be willing to
put that all together?

38:00.452 --> 38:02.497
I got so many ideas, you're
gonna have to do this next year.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.586
Okay. Yeah.

38:04.630 --> 38:05.935
Yeah, let's
-give it a shot.
-All right.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.459
-Thank you.
-All right.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.895
I owe you.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.158
Oh, baby, I'm cashing in.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.681
Great to see you, Mumford.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.901
Same here.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.560
-Jack.
-Hey, I just saved

38:21.603 --> 38:23.475
-Deacon's marriage.
-And solved a
15-year-old murder.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.478
It's a banner day
for a retired team leader.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.828
Days like this I miss the most.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.178
Seeing the whole team work
together to make it happen.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.919
All those people in there
that you and I trained.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.442
That's why I've
been thinking.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.836
With Luca still gone,
Deacon's been having

38:36.879 --> 38:38.968
to carry load training
the SWAT recruits on his own.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.754
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra set of eyes on some

38:41.797 --> 38:43.495
of these training exercises.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.714
Now, it would have to be
on a volunteer basis, of course.

38:45.758 --> 38:49.370
I'll check my schedule, see
if I can carve out some time.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.632
That's great.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.068
It'll be nice to see you

38:52.112 --> 38:54.549
around HQ again... occasionally.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.768
-I'll drink to that.
-I'm buying.

38:55.811 --> 38:56.986
Damn right.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.554
But we got
to make a pit stop first.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.971
Hey, what's up, D?

40:09.015 --> 40:10.320
Nichelle's not giving us
the money no more,

40:10.364 --> 40:11.278
and no bank in the world's

40:11.321 --> 40:13.193
gonna give us
a loan, so...

40:14.281 --> 40:17.415
Well, a bank might not,
but I will.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.113
-What?
-I spoke to Nichelle.

40:20.156 --> 40:22.115
Oh, I bet you did.

40:22.158 --> 40:25.205
And I told her that I would
put up the seed money myself.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.469
D, I read through your proposal.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.602
And I'll admit
I was a little skeptical,

40:30.645 --> 40:33.126
but you convinced me, kid.

40:33.169 --> 40:34.606
So, how would you feel about me
kicking in enough cash

40:34.649 --> 40:35.781
to get you started?

40:35.824 --> 40:36.782
For real?

40:36.825 --> 40:38.610
For real, but

40:38.653 --> 40:39.785
there are conditions.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.395
Now, for starters,
while I do think

40:41.439 --> 40:43.397
you have a solid idea,

40:43.441 --> 40:44.790
it wouldn't hurt for you
to get a little more knowledge

40:44.833 --> 40:46.095
under your belt
to help you succeed.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.794
And one of the junior colleges
that we looked at

40:48.837 --> 40:51.013
has marketing
and accounting classes

40:51.057 --> 40:52.406
-that you should consider.
-Deal.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.190
Oh, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.

40:54.234 --> 40:57.672
I mean, what exactly
are we talking about here?

40:57.716 --> 40:59.718
You giving us a loan?

40:59.761 --> 41:02.677
I was thinking I'd be more
of a partner in the business.

41:02.721 --> 41:05.506
You and me in business together?

41:05.550 --> 41:06.638
Mm-hmm.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.467
Well, our customers, uh,

41:09.510 --> 41:12.208
they ain't necessarily too fond
of the boys in blue.

41:12.252 --> 41:14.515
-You want the money or not?
-Yes, we want the money.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.778
Right, Dad?

41:21.130 --> 41:23.132
Yeah. Yeah, son.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.656
Perfect. I'm gonna go write
a list of what to do next.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.266
I'll be right back.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.534
You think you're smart,
don't you?

41:34.579 --> 41:36.711
Smart enough.
