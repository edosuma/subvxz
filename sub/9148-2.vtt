<i>- Just please rethink this.
- Dude, this'll work.</i>

00:03.130 --> 00:04.963
<i>I know these things.
I'm a scientist.</i>

00:04.965 --> 00:06.298
A computer scientist.

00:06.300 --> 00:07.966
- This is dangerous!
- Trust.

00:07.968 --> 00:11.603
You can't put mouthwash into
cookie batter. It's idiotic.

00:11.605 --> 00:13.388
There's, like, fluoride
and crap in that.

00:13.390 --> 00:16.074
Fluoride is good for you.
And try to deny

00:16.076 --> 00:17.743
that mint chocolate chip
is the best cookie.

00:17.745 --> 00:20.189
Just try.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.486
To the quiz cave!

I have a massive power flux
on all circuits.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.963
Robo-Bo!
Status update!

00:54.965 --> 00:57.666
<i>St. Cloud has tapped into
our power grid.</i>

00:57.668 --> 01:00.719
<i>One more burst, and we'll be
fried like southern chicken.</i>

01:00.721 --> 01:02.637
Send a grounded z-pulse
through the electrical,

01:02.639 --> 01:04.172
then run diagnostics on the echo.

01:04.174 --> 01:06.892
Configure the kickback waves
to resonate at that frequency.

01:06.894 --> 01:08.643
Let's make him eat his own farts.

01:08.645 --> 01:11.480
<i>Brilliant, sir, but slightly off-putting.</i>

01:18.021 --> 01:19.654
Eat it, St. Cloud!

01:19.656 --> 01:22.073
<i>Fools.
Will you never learn?</i>

01:22.075 --> 01:25.360
<i>While you wasted your efforts
on a harmless monster truck,</i>

01:25.362 --> 01:29.531
<i>I had all the time in the world
to steal this from you.</i>

01:29.533 --> 01:33.535
- No! The holy of holies.
- The source of all our power.

01:33.537 --> 01:35.370
You won't get away with it, St. Cloud.

01:35.372 --> 01:39.591

It'll be too late to stop me</i>

my mountain hideaway.</i>

01:42.045 --> 01:46.264
<i>So... maybe next year.
Maybe no go.</i>

01:46.266 --> 01:48.993
- To the Conjectu-craft!
- Uh, hey, uh, I have

01:48.994 --> 01:51.486
a teeth-cleaning appointment
first thing in the morning.

01:51.488 --> 01:54.823
Hey, can we do this tomorrow?
Like 10:00, 10:30?

01:54.825 --> 01:59.761
<i>Well... I do a bunch of things
I flaked on, so I'm down for that.</i>

01:59.763 --> 02:02.564
Okay, no, that's cool. I-I didn't
really sleep well last night.

02:02.566 --> 02:04.132
<i>Okay. So, uh... </i>

02:04.134 --> 02:09.287
<i>I will get you, Quizboy ...
at a reasonable hour.</i>

02:09.425 --> 02:11.864
<b>6x02 - "Maybe No Go"</b>

02:14.578 --> 02:17.746
- Wait ... is that a... piece?
- Huh? Piece of what?

02:17.748 --> 02:19.247
No, I mean a gun.

02:19.249 --> 02:21.750
I was attempting to use
the vernacular of the streets ...

02:21.752 --> 02:23.001
trying out New York rusty.

02:23.003 --> 02:27.088
Well, that really worked out for you.
Yeah, strict O.S.I. policy.

02:27.090 --> 02:31.176
Congratulations, doc,
you're a top-level client.

02:31.178 --> 02:33.795
What is this, decaf?
It tastes like old puddle.

02:33.797 --> 02:37.599
It's cafix. I've nervous bowels,
and I thought ...

02:37.601 --> 02:40.852
Ah. Thank you, Helper.
Uh, what happened to jBot?

02:43.523 --> 02:45.607
Well, hello, handsome.

02:45.609 --> 02:47.943
Look who's on the front page
again, Brock.

02:47.945 --> 02:49.244
"C-E-Oh-no.

02:49.246 --> 02:51.746
Second Venture son
drives stocks into the ground."

02:51.748 --> 02:54.783
- Do you have any real coffee?
- What? I'm mixing things up.

02:54.785 --> 02:56.685
Gettin' slappy
with this little company

02:56.687 --> 02:57.986
my brother trusted me with.

02:57.988 --> 02:59.888
No reason for stockholders
to jump ship.

02:59.890 --> 03:03.625
You fired everybody and started
spending. Can you blame them?

03:03.627 --> 03:07.062
I've big plans for Ven-whatever.
But fine. I don't need a mutiny

03:07.064 --> 03:08.697
because people can't post
a picture of their lunch

03:08.699 --> 03:10.365
on tweet-tweet or whatever.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.968
Where's that idiot Pirate?
I'm sure he knows how to fix this.

03:12.970 --> 03:15.503
Trust me, you don't want him.
He's back on tranque.

03:15.505 --> 03:17.606
I... don't want to know
what that is.

03:17.608 --> 03:19.007
I'm going out for coffee.

03:19.009 --> 03:20.909
Yeah, this grain
beverage isn't cutting it.

03:20.911 --> 03:22.677
I'd rather irritate my bowels.

03:22.679 --> 03:24.946
Get me a coffee, too!
And a Pirate.

03:24.948 --> 03:28.483
<i>No. I-I...
Double no! Extra no!</i>

03:28.485 --> 03:30.986
Cherry-on-top, gold-plated no!

03:30.988 --> 03:33.872
- Also... no.
- Sweetie, it's not a request.

03:33.874 --> 03:36.124
It's a political and tactical
move for the Guild.

03:36.126 --> 03:38.243
- You can't arch Dr. Venture.
- But if we ...

03:38.245 --> 03:41.329
This Guild thing was supposed
to be for our own good!

03:41.331 --> 03:43.581
And now you're stabbing me
in the wings!

03:43.583 --> 03:45.467
Once we get the Guild
back on its feet,

03:45.469 --> 03:47.052
you can arch Dr. Venture later.

03:47.054 --> 03:49.471
We'll bump up your low arching
level and file for some ...

03:49.473 --> 03:52.607
- Wait ... low arching level?
- Wait ... what level are we at now?

03:52.609 --> 03:54.509
On the books, y-you're a 6.

03:54.511 --> 03:57.979
But that was when you had over
100 henchmen and a flying cocoon.

03:57.981 --> 04:02.050
So if I were to reassess,
I'd go with 3, maybe 4.

04:02.052 --> 04:05.887
3 or 4?! Come on!
Tantrum Rex is a level 4.

04:05.889 --> 04:08.323
Tantrum Rex!
He looks like that

04:08.325 --> 04:10.659
"not the mama, not the mama"
baby-dinosaur puppet.

04:10.661 --> 04:13.328
- Right, you know that if we want t...
- It's not just the arching level.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.363
There are like a dozen villains
ahead of you.

04:15.365 --> 04:16.865
Venture is top dog now.

04:16.867 --> 04:19.617
Will you just trust me?
I'm on your team.

04:19.619 --> 04:21.119
Why can't you see that?

04:21.120 --> 04:24.039
Oh, I don't know. Because
you're in a Guild jacket, maybe?

04:24.041 --> 04:26.875
- Yeah, but if you just ... just ...
- I haven't unpacked my bathrobe.

04:26.877 --> 04:29.711
- See?
- That's, like, inappropriate.

04:29.713 --> 04:31.262
There is no way I
could stay mad at that.

04:31.264 --> 04:34.215
I've 10 minutes
before I leave for assembly.

04:34.217 --> 04:36.718
- Make-up sex?
- Only if you bump up my level.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.804
- And wear the cheerleader outfit?
- Deal.

04:39.806 --> 04:42.107
All right, you guys suck.
Meeting adjourned.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.059
Way to be totally unprofessional.

04:44.061 --> 04:47.562
<i>Hold on, pookums.
I forgot something in the kitchen.</i>

04:47.564 --> 04:49.030
Get into her files and get us a list

04:49.032 --> 04:50.782
of who's ahead of me
for arching Venture.

04:50.784 --> 04:52.901
I want names, addresses, schedules,

04:52.903 --> 04:54.986
strengths, weaknesses ...
the works.

04:54.988 --> 04:57.572
- You have five minutes.
- Five minutes? I need more time.

04:57.574 --> 05:00.125
She's putting on
the cheerleader outfit!

05:00.127 --> 05:02.127
I can't last more than five minutes.

05:02.129 --> 05:05.080
I know ... I'll pretend
I can't find the cleanup towel

05:05.082 --> 05:08.383
and leave her caked in my
sticky triumph for a few minutes.

05:08.385 --> 05:11.469
- Will that help?
- I hate that you tell me this stuff.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.975
<i>Oh, look at this here
dangerous situation!</i>

05:16.977 --> 05:19.060
That beastie is a man-eater!

05:19.062 --> 05:21.346
<i>Ye better dart that mighty bear!</i>

05:21.348 --> 05:23.982
<i>And ... And I'd dart
the Pirate, as well ... </i>

05:23.984 --> 05:26.267
for safety!
Dart me for safety!

05:26.269 --> 05:29.386
<i>Do not approach the bear.
We are going to subdue it.</i>

05:30.440 --> 05:32.273
Hey, hey, hey,
don't bogart me fix!

05:32.275 --> 05:35.944
Ohhh!
There you are, me little whore!

05:35.946 --> 05:38.663
Just get on your knees and
give the Pirate what he wants.

05:42.085 --> 05:44.786
<i>Dude, why are you complicating this?</i>

05:44.788 --> 05:48.540
Why don't we just fly in and storm
his estate with lasers blazing?

05:48.542 --> 05:50.708
One, we don't have lasers to blaze.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.877
Two, I just repaired
the Conjectu-craft

05:52.879 --> 05:55.680
- from the last time we did that.
- Ugh. Fine.

05:55.682 --> 05:59.467
All right, park it. You're
wasting ionized phosphates.

06:00.804 --> 06:03.104
We really need to put wheels
on that or something.

06:03.106 --> 06:06.307
I'll use my Quizboy grappling hand!

06:08.145 --> 06:10.145
That's it?
It doesn't pull you up?

06:10.147 --> 06:12.530
Where would I hide
the pneumatic gears for that?

06:12.532 --> 06:16.284
My arm would be all huge, like
"the man whose arms exploded guy."

06:16.286 --> 06:17.702
- Just climb it.
- Ugh.

06:17.704 --> 06:20.905
That was the single most
frightening thing ever aired on TV.

06:20.907 --> 06:22.791
Ow! Ah! O-Oh!
Dude, stop! Let go! Stop!

06:22.793 --> 06:24.459
- What?
- That kills!

06:24.461 --> 06:27.712
- This thing is attached to my nerves!
- Great design, Billy.

06:27.714 --> 06:29.631
Ehh. I can't get my hand
off this thing.

06:29.633 --> 06:30.999
White, what are you doing?

06:31.001 --> 06:33.084
Yeah, hey, it's
Conjectural Technologies.

06:33.086 --> 06:35.503
Can you capture us already?

06:37.724 --> 06:42.143
- Ta-da. We're in.
- Conjectural Technologies!

06:43.597 --> 06:47.482
Here's your coffee, black,
and a Pirate, unconscious.

06:47.484 --> 06:50.351
Look at him! Ugh!
Get him out of the living room!

06:50.353 --> 06:52.403
He smells like he went
to the bathroom on himself.

06:52.405 --> 06:55.073
More like he went to the bathroom on me.

06:55.075 --> 06:57.826
Oh, you're a talented polar bear ...

06:57.828 --> 07:00.829
all up on your hind paws.

07:00.831 --> 07:05.166
Oh, hey, I'm gonna just take
a wee hit of this, Mr. Bear.

07:05.168 --> 07:06.784
That's a real gun, idiot.

07:06.786 --> 07:11.039
Hank, go find your brother.
I got a, uh, little job for you.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.874
You're 100% sure this is the address?

07:12.876 --> 07:16.628
I mean, what kind of supervillain
lives in Paterson, New Jersey?

07:16.630 --> 07:19.881
- Yeah, you're one to talk.
- Please. Newark trumps Paterson.

07:19.883 --> 07:21.583
And we have a mansion!

07:21.585 --> 07:23.451
Yeah, yeah, well, just one address

07:23.453 --> 07:25.587
for both residence and secret lair.

07:25.589 --> 07:28.356
Maybe the house is made out
of a spaceship or something.

07:30.293 --> 07:31.459
What do you want?

07:31.461 --> 07:33.795
Hello, ma'am. I'm just
gonna cut to the chase here.

07:33.797 --> 07:36.481
My name is the Mighty Monarch.
This is my henchman.

07:36.483 --> 07:38.566
Uh, #21... of 1.

07:38.568 --> 07:41.619
You are Redusa, supervillain
in line to arch Dr. Venture.

07:41.621 --> 07:44.097
So if I could just get
your signature stating that

07:44.098 --> 07:46.574
you waive this privilege,
we'll just be on our way.

07:46.576 --> 07:49.043
And our gratitude and this
collectable Monarch pen

07:49.045 --> 07:50.578
will be your reward.

07:50.580 --> 07:53.548
I don't know who you are,
why you're dressed like that,

07:53.550 --> 07:54.999
or who you think I am,

07:55.001 --> 07:57.919
but you'd better get off my
porch before I call the cops.

07:59.923 --> 08:03.091
- Well, that worked great.
- Drag her inside.

08:04.761 --> 08:06.178
Mousse? I didn't even know

08:06.179 --> 08:08.930
- they made hair mousse anymore.
- You had all morning.

08:08.932 --> 08:12.016
<i>Well, you guys took so long,
I thought I'd freshen up.</i>

08:12.018 --> 08:15.103
Pei!
Bring me my soap mitt.

08:15.105 --> 08:17.605
And don't play stupid
about the red ball.

08:17.607 --> 08:19.107
<i>I know what it is.</i>

08:19.109 --> 08:20.825
Yes, it's a prop from Duran Duran's

08:20.827 --> 08:22.777
"Is there something
I should know?" video.

08:22.779 --> 08:26.080
Sure it is, Quizboy.
It's not the source of your power

08:26.082 --> 08:28.166
or the key to human history at all.

08:28.168 --> 08:32.669
It's just a red bouncy ball
from a video. Whatevs.

08:32.672 --> 08:35.256
Hey, hey, hey, check it out.
I'm in flock of seagulls.

08:35.258 --> 08:37.207
Is that Henrietta Pussycat?

08:37.210 --> 08:40.461
The Henrietta Pussycat from the
neighborhood of make-believe?

08:40.462 --> 08:42.964
The same.
Thank you, Pei.

08:42.966 --> 08:47.518
I use her as a shower mitt.
Does that bother you, Quizboy?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.388
It's sacrilege!
That's a priceless artifact,

08:50.390 --> 08:53.691
and a part of our collective
childhood, you monster!

08:53.693 --> 08:55.526
Hey, look, look!
I'm in the exploited.

08:55.528 --> 09:00.148
<i>Mmm. She's super-absorbent
and so extra-soft.</i>

09:00.150 --> 09:02.150
Aren't you, Henrietta?

09:02.152 --> 09:04.652
"Meow, meow.
Yes I am. Meow, meow."

09:04.654 --> 09:07.288
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Just give us the ball!

09:07.290 --> 09:10.158
<i>No, I've got this whole thing
planned for the ball.</i>

09:10.160 --> 09:13.711
<i>I've got a whole set made and
everything ... worth the wait.</i>

09:13.713 --> 09:16.965
<i>What, Henrietta? You want
to wash me... down there?</i>

09:16.967 --> 09:18.166
<i>Well, by all means.</i>

09:18.168 --> 09:21.636
Please tell me you're not doing
what I think you're doing!

09:21.638 --> 09:24.505
Billy, remember tool academy?

09:27.761 --> 09:29.510
Where am I? Hell?

09:29.512 --> 09:33.431
Or a children's TV show
that takes place in hell?

09:33.433 --> 09:35.683
Getting off tranquilizer darts.

09:35.685 --> 09:39.020
For this, you will need
one bed ... chained to.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.938
Ladies' shirt ... Pirate-sized.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.524
Beef-flavored tomato juice ...
two jugs of.

09:43.526 --> 09:44.993
Fruit snack ... 10 feet of.

09:44.995 --> 09:48.329
<i>Coffee cake ... crunchy part of.
Picture of old people dancing.</i>

09:48.331 --> 09:51.449
Sympathetic kitten, television,
"She's all that" DVD.

09:51.451 --> 09:53.868
<i>One bucket for urine,
one for feces, one for vomitus.</i>

09:53.870 --> 09:57.372
<i>Oh, and one for the kitten.</i>

09:59.259 --> 10:01.209
All right, take a seat, son.

10:01.211 --> 10:05.963
- Krill? Lots of omega-3.
- No. But thanks.

10:05.965 --> 10:08.049
Looks really ...
are those alive?

10:08.051 --> 10:10.101
Till I crush them in my mouth.

10:10.103 --> 10:12.937
So... you got something for me?

10:12.939 --> 10:15.556
Uh...
there was a-a thing.

10:15.558 --> 10:18.559
Hm.
Do I look different to you? Huh?

10:18.561 --> 10:21.229
Bigger, maybe?
You know, like, uh, stronger?

10:21.231 --> 10:22.447
No. I mean... yeah.

10:22.449 --> 10:25.566
You're ... you're a very strong guy.
You've always been strong.

10:25.568 --> 10:29.070
Oh, funny. I-I can lift this
without any effort.

10:29.072 --> 10:32.874
Maybe all them beachbody DVDs
are finally paying off.

10:32.876 --> 10:35.243
<i>Because this can't be
lighter than usual.</i>

10:35.245 --> 10:37.662
<i>You'd never do that to me,
would you?</i>

10:37.664 --> 10:39.464
So it's me, right?

10:39.466 --> 10:41.466
It's Venture.
He refused our protection.

10:41.468 --> 10:43.668
I-If he doesn't pay us,
we can't pay you.

10:43.670 --> 10:47.869
He refused your protection? Does
he understand what that means?!

10:47.904 --> 10:49.424
Okay!

10:49.426 --> 10:52.810
Well... let's see
if the good ship Venture

10:52.812 --> 10:55.179
is a strong and mighty vessel.

10:55.181 --> 10:58.900
She's going on
a nantucket sleigh ride.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.914
She's coming to.
So, are you gonna kill her?

11:04.916 --> 11:07.533
Me?! I'm not gonna kill her.
Nobody's gonna kill her!

11:07.535 --> 11:09.369
We're gonna just be
more persuasive.

11:09.371 --> 11:11.371
Oh, yeah, I'll just offer her
another free pen.

11:11.373 --> 11:14.374
How could she refuuuuse a free pen?

11:14.376 --> 11:16.125
I was thinking on my feet.
Come on!

11:16.127 --> 11:19.712
Well, now that you have experienced
the power of the mighty Monarch,

11:19.714 --> 11:22.599
- Oh, where am I?
- Let's have that signature, huh, Redusa.

11:23.385 --> 11:25.223
- What the ...
- Drop!

11:27.305 --> 11:29.138
<i>Kiss my ass!</i>

11:31.726 --> 11:33.726
That's really ironical.

11:34.896 --> 11:37.030
Ohhhh.
Okay, I get her name now.

11:37.032 --> 11:40.233
- Don't look at her!
- Like that's a problem. She's repulsive.

11:40.235 --> 11:43.286
I've seen "Clash of the titans"
enough times to know what goes next.

11:43.288 --> 11:45.154
You know, the Harry Hamlin
version, obviously.

11:45.156 --> 11:46.489
Yeah? Try it, fatty.

11:46.491 --> 11:49.826
Explain to the Guild how you, a
villain, killed another villain.

11:49.828 --> 11:51.077
Dude, I have your file.

11:51.079 --> 11:53.246
You never re-upped
your Guild membership.

11:53.248 --> 11:55.498
I could pop off your
little head legally.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.384
Or I could leave it on
your neck, you go to the Guild,

11:58.386 --> 12:01.004
and tell them you're
not interested in Venture.

12:01.006 --> 12:04.257
Look, Venture is a douche, okay?
We're doing you a favor here.

12:04.259 --> 12:06.142
You still get to keep the free pen.

12:22.277 --> 12:25.028
Aw, pally, you're, like,
a wicked-bad pirate.

12:25.030 --> 12:27.113
I'm a good pirate!

12:27.115 --> 12:29.165
Piiirraaate!

12:30.585 --> 12:33.119
No! No, baby!
No! No!

12:33.121 --> 12:35.455
You're an incompetent businessman.

12:35.457 --> 12:37.373
No, chairman! I'm good!

12:37.926 --> 12:39.425
No, no!

12:39.427 --> 12:41.844
Pirate. Pirate!

12:41.846 --> 12:44.347
I need help with my
damn company. Pirate!

12:44.349 --> 12:46.432
- Is that his name? Just Pirate?
- Right?

12:46.434 --> 12:47.800
Ooh! Can we name him?

12:47.802 --> 12:51.304
I think "Sir Reginald
von Pirate guy" is cool.

12:51.306 --> 12:53.056
He's not a pet pirate.

12:53.058 --> 12:55.975
W-W-What is this?

12:55.977 --> 12:58.277
- An intervention.
- You know what I see?

12:58.279 --> 13:00.313
I see a bunch of people
that love you ...

13:00.315 --> 13:03.366
love you like crazy ... and they
feel like they're losing you.

13:03.368 --> 13:06.202
Eh. Is that me poop
in that bucket there?

13:06.204 --> 13:07.954
Very much so.

13:13.328 --> 13:15.995
<i>Brock-star, this is Mr. Chin.</i>

13:15.997 --> 13:18.297
<i>Emergency call from Mr. Chin.</i>

13:18.299 --> 13:20.133
Don't do that.
Drives me nuts.

13:20.135 --> 13:24.303
<i>So fun! Oh. I see you're
wearing the gun. Impressed.</i>

13:24.305 --> 13:25.505
Yeah. It's not loaded.

13:25.507 --> 13:28.257
<i>Now I'm double impressed.
Anyway, just got wind</i>

13:28.259 --> 13:30.176
<i>of a level-10 arching coming your way.</i>

13:30.178 --> 13:31.728
Are you kidding me?
Already?

13:31.730 --> 13:34.564
- I'm not even set up over here.
- Welcome to New York.

13:34.566 --> 13:36.899
<i>Your idiot employer didn't
pay off the local talent,</i>

13:36.901 --> 13:39.102
<i>so you're gonna be
taught a little lesson.</i>

13:39.104 --> 13:41.521
- Who's the teacher?
- Chester Ong.

13:41.523 --> 13:43.689
<i>In the '80s, he worked
with his brother Doug,</i>

13:43.691 --> 13:46.325
<i>trying to find a cure for cancer
in cuttlefish DNA.</i>

13:46.327 --> 13:48.528
<i>You know the drill ...
experiments on himself,</i>

13:48.530 --> 13:50.863
<i>gets all f-reaky looking,
goes into villainy.</i>

13:50.865 --> 13:52.782
<i>He goes by "Wide Wale"
these days.</i>

13:52.784 --> 13:54.500
Okay, how fast can I get a scramble?

13:54.502 --> 13:56.452
I need ronins, stun mines,
60 feet of laser fence,

13:56.454 --> 13:58.337
- at least ...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:58.339 --> 14:00.506
<i>This is going down
any moment, my love.</i>

14:00.508 --> 14:03.126
<i>You're in this alone.</i>

14:03.128 --> 14:06.596
Into the panic room!
Everybody! Now!

14:09.517 --> 14:11.684
Yes, we're very impressed
with your setup.

14:11.686 --> 14:14.137
My god! Just give
your evil speech already!

14:15.140 --> 14:18.724
See the pyramid?
The time machine from the video?

14:18.726 --> 14:21.561
- Yeah, I bought that.
- Yes! Just go!

14:21.563 --> 14:25.364
This is the "Please please tell me" ball ...

14:25.366 --> 14:29.152
formed by Marc Bolan,
inflated by Roxy Music,

14:29.154 --> 14:33.239
its power passed down to every
new romantic band ever since.

14:33.241 --> 14:35.908
It's a prop from an '80s video.

14:35.910 --> 14:39.295
Without this ball, the New Romantics
could never have happened.

14:39.297 --> 14:41.998
Duran Duran would be
a jock-rock band.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.084
You're completely nuts!
It's a red rubber ball!

14:45.086 --> 14:48.754
Imagine ... no Spandau Ballet
to write "If you leave."

14:48.756 --> 14:51.057
John Hughes is without inspiration,

14:51.059 --> 14:54.594
forcing Molly Ringwald to remain
on "The facts of life."

14:54.596 --> 14:57.230
Her plucky charm
propels the show into legend,

14:57.232 --> 15:00.766
allowing Kim Fields to
successfully run for public office.

15:00.768 --> 15:03.603
So tell me, Quizboy, are you prepared

15:03.605 --> 15:07.073
for a world of jocks
led by President Tootie?

15:07.075 --> 15:11.494
- It's a useless collectible!
- Just give us the ball, St. Cloud!

15:11.496 --> 15:13.112
You want the ball?

15:13.114 --> 15:16.032
Here. Take the ball.
Psych!

15:16.034 --> 15:19.368
N-No, no, seriously.
Here. You can have the ball.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.588
Oh, psych!
Could you be any more lame?

15:22.590 --> 15:25.625
Here. I was just kidding.

15:29.631 --> 15:33.549
- Ohh! Why did you do that?!
- I... uh, reflex?

15:33.551 --> 15:36.636
Reflex is a lonely child
who is waiting by the park.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.271
All right, fine! Have the ball!

15:38.273 --> 15:41.474
- So, what do you want?
- Oh, goody. The denouement.

15:41.476 --> 15:44.977
Well, as you know, this pyramid
is a portal to the old West.

15:44.979 --> 15:47.563
I'm going to send the ball
back in time.

15:47.565 --> 15:51.150
That is, unless you sell me
your company,

15:51.152 --> 15:55.955
Conjectural Technologies...
for a single penny.

15:55.957 --> 15:59.542
No. We're talking live rounds
and expected casualties.

15:59.544 --> 16:01.160
You're barely a rent-a-cop.

16:01.162 --> 16:04.330
If you want to be technical,
I'm barely a tour guide.

16:04.332 --> 16:07.917
This is a flashlight, not a gun.
But I'm all you got.

16:07.919 --> 16:11.087
All you got, sir!
Okay. Fair point.

16:11.089 --> 16:13.839
- What do you know about this Wide Wale?
- Class act.

16:13.841 --> 16:16.676
One of the Ong brothers,
joined the Guild in '87.

16:16.678 --> 16:18.511
Ruthless, but plays it safe.

16:18.513 --> 16:22.215
Runs with about 40 henchmen,
4 private guards, 1 valet.

16:22.217 --> 16:25.268
- Since 1995, he's been, uh ...
- Whoa! How do you know all this?

16:25.270 --> 16:28.821
Brock, I used to be a supervillain,
and I was in the O.S.I.

16:28.823 --> 16:31.524
I can tell you where King Gorilla
used to hide his porn.

16:31.526 --> 16:33.743
All right, so, how does Wide Wale move?

16:33.745 --> 16:37.496
Oh, submarine. He takes the old
septic and drainage lines.

16:37.498 --> 16:39.532
<i>He'll be coming through
the floor most likely ... </i>

16:39.534 --> 16:42.201
<i>- uh, kind of his thing.
- So, what do we got, sergeant?</i>

16:42.203 --> 16:44.537
Well... lobby, so, uh,

16:44.539 --> 16:46.706
all you got is the old crap
you see lying around,

16:46.708 --> 16:48.124
one overweight tour guide,

16:48.126 --> 16:51.544
and your pistol,
that is clearly not loaded.

16:51.546 --> 16:53.462
Went to the ZOO today.

16:53.464 --> 16:55.381
When's the last time
you went to the ZOO?

16:55.383 --> 16:58.851
Jet-powered automated trains,
conveyer belts on the streets,

16:58.853 --> 17:02.138
Plug-in replaceable kidneys ...
that's what I'm talking about.

17:02.140 --> 17:05.107
Not this "Angry birds" nonsense
my brother did.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.778
Oh, no, I get it.
Ven-Tech just ain't set up for that.

17:08.780 --> 17:11.063
Ven-Tech?
This building was my father's.

17:11.065 --> 17:13.816
It's built on
my great-grandfather's building.

17:13.818 --> 17:16.368
That's the legacy ...
a legacy of super science!

17:16.371 --> 17:19.704
A legacy of looking at tomorrow
like it hasn't come yet.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.824
And when it's here, it'll be amazing.

17:21.826 --> 17:24.577
Yeah, but you got to
live in reality, Dr. Venture.

17:24.579 --> 17:25.994
You run a corporation.

17:25.997 --> 17:29.498
You got shareholders and
products what need updates.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.134
Ye got to pay the bills, Dr. Venture.

17:32.136 --> 17:33.636
Well, why can't you do both?

17:33.638 --> 17:35.137
- Uh, how?
- What?

17:35.139 --> 17:37.556
Keep the public face
that's already functioning

17:37.558 --> 17:41.260
and set up a team to work on
the speculative engineering.

17:41.262 --> 17:42.812
Hm. How about that?

17:42.814 --> 17:45.815
Could work.
Yeah. That could work.

17:45.817 --> 17:46.932
Nice work, Dean.

17:46.934 --> 17:49.602
Nice work.
Now let's get back to my idea.

17:49.604 --> 17:52.605
Two words ... moon circus.

17:52.607 --> 17:54.190
<i>If there's no New Romantics,</i>

17:54.192 --> 17:56.692
<i>t-then stuff like nu rock
woulda happened way earlier.</i>

17:56.694 --> 17:59.111
I mean, Linkin Park and
System of a Down woulda formed

17:59.113 --> 18:01.614
in the '80s, and that
woulda ruined future hip-hop.

18:01.616 --> 18:03.616
And with no good hip-hop,
there's no RZA.

18:03.618 --> 18:06.452
And I lost my virginity to side "A"
of "Wu-tang forever."

18:06.454 --> 18:09.505
We had to do it. Just think of
what your hair would look like.

18:09.507 --> 18:11.040
Well, now we have nothing.

18:11.042 --> 18:15.011
Robo-Bo, all our inventions, our
home ... all sold to St. Cloud.

18:15.013 --> 18:17.797
All we have is that stupid ball
that you think is magic,

18:17.799 --> 18:21.967
- because you're a... a dreamer.
- Well, this was your dream, too.

18:21.969 --> 18:25.054
- Yeah ... was.
- White... it is magic.

18:25.056 --> 18:26.689
Why would you doubt that?

18:26.691 --> 18:29.775
It's the "Please please tell me" ball.
It was all worth it.

18:29.777 --> 18:32.478
We saved the world. We did.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.814
What are we gonna do now, Billy?

18:34.816 --> 18:35.981
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:35.983 --> 18:38.854
<i>We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.</i>

18:39.153 --> 18:41.203
<i>With their mortal enemies</i>

18:41.205 --> 18:43.656
<i>about to penetrate
their secret cave,</i>

18:43.658 --> 18:45.374
<i>Jonas had to make his move,</i>

18:45.376 --> 18:50.296
<i>pouring an estimated 4 tons of
liquid nitrogen into the river...</i>

18:56.220 --> 19:00.256
<i>Hey, hey, yo, yo, yo!
Stop shootin'! Stop shootin'!</i>

19:00.258 --> 19:03.559
Nobody is here.
We got stood up.

19:03.561 --> 19:05.344
What do we do?
This is kind of embarrassing.

19:05.346 --> 19:07.756
Why do I feel like
it's my fault for some reason?

19:07.793 --> 19:09.577
- Right? Like we did something wrong.
- Wait, wait.

19:09.578 --> 19:11.767
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Shhh.
What is that?

19:11.769 --> 19:15.905
<i>Please let me direct your attention
to the treasure of Churumucuo.</i>

19:15.907 --> 19:19.108
<i>Weighing 30 pounds of Aztec gold,</i>

19:19.110 --> 19:21.694
<i>this mask is considered priceless.</i>

19:21.696 --> 19:23.529
Hey, what are you
standing around for, huh?

19:23.531 --> 19:25.281
What, are you looking
for the gift shop?

19:25.283 --> 19:27.917
Go get me that mask!

19:29.620 --> 19:31.253
<i>It was pretty cool.</i>

19:31.255 --> 19:34.039
You move like a thin guy,
but you're not. You're beefy.

19:34.041 --> 19:38.043
- Yeah, this time, I did kick ass.
- Up top, my main henchman.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.546
Yeah, you think Redusa's
gonna do what we said?

19:40.548 --> 19:42.882
No, I think she's gonna
tattle on me to my wife.

19:42.884 --> 19:44.266
We need another method.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.135
<i>Mr. Monarch,
I have to show you something.</i>

19:46.137 --> 19:47.887
Your wife no home,
so I wait for you.

19:47.889 --> 19:49.472
You're no going to believe this.

19:49.474 --> 19:51.807
I knew you spoke [bleep] English!

19:51.809 --> 19:54.143
...and then we hit solid steel.

19:54.145 --> 19:56.612
So I sent the workers home
because of this.

19:56.614 --> 20:01.984
Get all ready for nutty crazy.
La-da!

20:01.986 --> 20:05.488
<i>I no go inside.
Muy creepy.</i>

20:05.490 --> 20:07.072
Manolo, you're a good man,

20:07.074 --> 20:09.074
even though you lied to me
about not speaking English.

20:09.076 --> 20:12.912
Now go home and do not tell anyone
about this, especially my wife.

20:12.914 --> 20:16.048
<i>Holy crap!
Get down here!</i>

20:16.050 --> 20:20.252
Ugh. It smells like
blue cheese down here.

20:20.254 --> 20:23.722
<i>You have got to be
[bleep] kidding me!</i>

20:28.229 --> 20:30.429
He, uh, took the bait and left?

20:30.431 --> 20:33.516
Now he's got a Tumbaga mask
that's mostly copper.

20:33.518 --> 20:36.485
Hell of a plan, Brock.
Hey, uh, how's your back?

20:37.688 --> 20:39.572
I can't believe
how much he weighed.

20:39.574 --> 20:42.191
I think tranquilizers
make bodies weigh more.

20:42.193 --> 20:46.278
So, uh, take the cloth elevator
down? Buy you a beer?

20:46.280 --> 20:49.081
Well, uh, still an alcoholic,
but, uh...

20:49.083 --> 20:53.285
ah, heck, I'll just go to
an extra meeting. It's on me.

20:53.287 --> 20:56.121
<i>One, two, three!</i>

20:59.210 --> 21:02.795
Yeah, well, it was like stealing
lilies from a corpse, Badhul.

21:02.797 --> 21:06.382
Yeah, hauled in easily 700 grand
in Aztec treasure.

21:06.384 --> 21:07.800
You shoulda been there!

21:10.354 --> 21:13.639
Apparently, we had visitors.
We have been pranked.

21:13.641 --> 21:16.108
Hi-freakin'-larious.

21:16.110 --> 21:18.978
Hey! Shh, shh.
I hear you breathin'.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.647
<i>Who's there?
Come on out here!</i>

21:53.771 --> 21:56.322
Good morning, Peter.

21:56.324 --> 21:57.690
<i>Who is it?</i>

21:57.692 --> 21:59.525
It's our archenemy
and owner of our life.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.776
<i>Tell him to die!</i>

22:00.778 --> 22:02.244
What, you come here
for breakfast?

22:02.246 --> 22:06.082
No, I'm just here to inform you
that I sold your company

22:06.084 --> 22:09.869
and your miserable hides
for a considerable profit.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.837
Oh, wait ...
that's gloating, isn't it?

22:11.839 --> 22:13.589
Oh, well. Here's the info.

22:13.591 --> 22:17.793
- Ta-ta, losers. Mm.
- Ugh. Look at his hips.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.929
I swear that guy takes estrogen pills.

22:19.931 --> 22:24.865
Pack your bags, White.
We're going to New York City!

22:25.210 --> 22:28.613
