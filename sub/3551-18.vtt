WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.203 --> 00:04.035
I NEED A C.F.O.
PREPARED TO GIVE YOU

00:04.035 --> 00:06.507
STOCK OPTIONS,
ACCESS TO THE COMPANY JET.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.540
TOM GOT A JOB OFFER
HE COULDN'T REFUSE.

00:09.540 --> 00:12.213
I AM IN.
 (whispers) YES!

00:12.213 --> 00:16.015
AT DIALYSIS,
SUSAN MADE A FRIEND.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.619
BETH TOOK HER LIFE,

00:18.619 --> 00:20.191
WHICH LED TO SUSAN
GETTING A KIDNEY...

00:20.191 --> 00:23.194
HONOR BETH'S LIFE BY
ALLOWING YOU TO MAKE HER WELL.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.255
(gasps)

00:24.255 --> 00:26.057
AND FELICIA BEING FREED.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.259
I JUST HEARD
FROM THE PAROLE BOARD.

00:28.259 --> 00:30.261
THEY'VE DECIDED TO GRANT
YOUR REQUEST

00:30.261 --> 00:31.662
FOR HUMANITARIAN RELEASE.

00:31.662 --> 00:33.464
(voice breaking)
ALEX LEFT ME.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.236
(whispers) OH, HONEY.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.539
I GUESS HE JUST GOT SICK
OF LIVING WITH A DRUNK.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.673
AND BREE HELPED HER SON
FACE HIS ADDICTION.

00:43.814 --> 00:46.277
(sighs)

00:50.681 --> 00:52.583
(Mary Alice)
WHEN BREE VAN DE KAMP

00:52.583 --> 00:55.826
DECIDED TO STOP DRINKING,
HER RECIPE FOR SOBRIETY

00:55.826 --> 01:00.131
WAS THE 12 STEPS
OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.763
SHE ADMITTED SHE WAS POWERLESS
OVER ALCOHOL...

01:02.763 --> 01:05.096
(sighs)
 (glass clinks)

01:05.096 --> 01:10.070
SHE ASKED GOD
TO REMOVE HER SHORTCOMINGS.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.805
SHE MADE A LIST OF ALL
THE PEOPLE SHE HAD HARMED.

01:16.647 --> 01:21.081
SO WHEN HER SON ANDREW
DECIDED TO STOP DRINKING,

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
BREE WAS PLEASED
TO SEE HIM FOLLOW THOSE STEPS

01:24.084 --> 01:25.786
AS SUCCESSFULLY AS SHE HAD.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.818
(sighs) LET ME SEE IT AGAIN.

01:27.818 --> 01:29.860
(giggles)

01:30.861 --> 01:35.866
AHH. 30 DAYS SOBER.
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:35.866 --> 01:38.129
I FEEL GREAT, MOM.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.100
AND IT GETS BETTER
ALL THE TIME.
 (clatter)

01:40.100 --> 01:43.103
JUST KEEP GOING TO MEETINGS
AND WORKING THOSE STEPS.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.506
YEAH, I KIND OF STALLED OUT
AROUND NUMBER EIGHT, THOUGH.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.108
OOH, THAT IS A TOUGH ONE.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.111
NO ONE LIKES TO MAKE LISTS
OF PEOPLE THEY'VE DONE HARM TO,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.244
PARTICULARLY
WITH YOUR PENMANSHIP.

01:53.244 --> 01:55.516
NO, I WROTE THE LIST.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.388
BUT NOW I HAVE
TO MAKE THE AMENDS,

01:57.388 --> 02:02.353
AND THERE'S ONE PERSON
I'VE BEEN REALLY AWFUL TO.

02:02.353 --> 02:08.799
WELL, I KNOW IT SEEMS DIFFICULT,
BUT GIVE IT A CHANCE.

02:08.799 --> 02:13.634
SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE FORGIVING
THAN WE GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.810
(laughs)

02:19.810 --> 02:22.573
YOU THOUGHT I MEANT YOU?
 WELL, OF COURSE I DID.

02:22.573 --> 02:23.844
AW, MOM.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.747
UH, NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE
WAY DOWN THE LIST.

02:26.747 --> 02:27.778
I THINK YOU'RE,
LIKE, SEVENTH.

02:27.778 --> 02:30.621
SEVENTH?

02:30.621 --> 02:33.824
I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT
THESE SIX PEOPLE AHEAD OF ME.

02:33.824 --> 02:35.526
DID YOU STEAL
 THEIR POCKETBOOK?

02:35.526 --> 02:37.328
DID YOU WRECK THEIR CAR?

02:37.328 --> 02:40.291
STICK A KITCHEN KNIFE THROUGH
AN OIL PORTRAIT OF THEM?

02:40.291 --> 02:43.334
OKAY, CALM DOWN.
 I WILL NOT CALM DOWN.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.836
I RESENT YOU THINKING YOU'VE
HARMED ANYONE MORE THAN ME.

02:45.836 --> 02:47.838
WELL, I HAVE.

02:47.838 --> 02:51.202
AND IF I'M GONNA MAKE AMENDS,
I NEED TO START NOW...

02:51.202 --> 02:54.405
WITH THE TOP OF THE LIST.
(sighs)

02:54.405 --> 02:57.878
AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?
WHO IS THIS VICTIM NUMBER ONE?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.651
MR. SOLIS.

03:00.651 --> 03:06.757
YES, BREE WAS DILIGENT
ABOUT FOLLOWING THE 12 STEPS.

03:06.757 --> 03:10.461
AFTER ALL,
I DID SORT OF KILL HIS MOM.

03:10.461 --> 03:14.525
BUT EVEN SHE COULD RECOGNIZE
A STEP TOO FAR.

03:14.525 --> 03:27.378
ANDREW, STOP!

03:27.378 --> 03:28.739
WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN

03:28.739 --> 03:32.883
TO APOLOGIZE
WHEN THEY MAKE A MISTAKE.

03:32.883 --> 03:37.888
WE TELL THEM THAT IT'S WRONG
TO BLAME OTHERS...

03:39.620 --> 03:42.623
OR PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED...

03:44.725 --> 03:48.599
OR TRY TO COVER IT UP.

03:50.801 --> 03:53.664
BUT THERE ARE THOSE TIMES
WHEN APOLOGIZING...

03:53.664 --> 03:55.666
HEY, CARLOS!
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

03:55.666 --> 03:58.439
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF ALL.
 BE RIGHT THERE.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.712
(car door closes)
 ANDREW, STOP. YOU REALLY NEED
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

04:01.712 --> 04:03.714
MOM, YOU KNOW
WHAT THE STEP SAYS--

04:03.714 --> 04:05.846
MAKE DIRECT AMENDS
TO THOSE WE HAVE HARMED.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.948
UNLESS TO DO SO
WOULD INJURE THEM OR OTHERS.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.421
AND IF CARLOS FINDS OUT,
TRUST ME,

04:10.421 --> 04:12.423
HE'S GOING TO INJURE OTHERS!

04:12.423 --> 04:13.854
HEY, BUDDY. WHAT'S UP?

04:13.854 --> 04:16.557
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEVER TOLD YOU...

04:16.557 --> 04:19.790
UH, YES. HOW WONDERFUL YOU WERE
TO HIM AFTER REX DIED.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.992
YOU WERE LIKE
A... SURROGATE FATHER.

04:21.992 --> 04:23.934
OH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.766
YOU WERE. YOU TOOK HIM
ON HUNTING TRIPS,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.968
FOOTBALL GAMES, CAR RACES...

04:27.968 --> 04:29.770
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GAY THEN,

04:29.770 --> 04:32.473
OR I'D HAVE THROWN IN
A FEW MUSICALS.
 HA HA HA HA!

04:32.473 --> 04:35.476
THE POINT IS, YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN SO KIND TO PEOPLE,

04:35.476 --> 04:38.449
NEVER INURING THEM...
OR OTHERS.

04:38.449 --> 04:41.452
WELL, THAT WAS THE SAME YEAR
THAT MY MOM DIED,

04:41.452 --> 04:43.614
SO I WAS WORKING THROUGH
SOME GRIEF, TOO.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.916
IT WAS GREAT THAT WE
COULD BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER.

04:45.916 --> 04:52.393
SO... THAT WAS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?

04:52.393 --> 04:56.767
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, JUST, UH... THANKS.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.469
NO PROBLEM.

05:00.671 --> 05:04.835
(lowered voice) SOMEONE JUST
EARNED ANOTHER PIE. (sighs)

05:15.716 --> 05:17.788
HEY!

05:17.788 --> 05:20.090
WHOEVER'S IN HERE,
I OWN THIS HOUSE,

05:20.090 --> 05:22.353
AND I WANT YOU OUT NOW!

05:22.353 --> 05:23.924
(creaking)

05:30.601 --> 05:32.733
WELL, HELLO, PAUL.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.035
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.737
I'M JUST NOSING AROUND

05:36.737 --> 05:39.770
TO SEE WHAT I'LL NEED TO BUY
BEFORE I MOVE IN.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.472
NOT MUCH, APPARENTLY.

05:41.472 --> 05:44.575
I HAD NO IDEA
THE PLACE CAME FURNISHED.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.017
HAVE YOU LOST WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR MIND?

05:47.017 --> 05:48.719
THIS IS MY HOUSE! NOW GET OUT!

05:48.719 --> 05:50.721
OH, I KNOW YOU BOUGHT IT.

05:50.721 --> 05:53.424
YOU BOUGHT A LOT OF HOUSES
ON THIS STREET,

05:53.424 --> 05:55.426
BUT YOU DIDN'T
WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW,

05:55.426 --> 05:57.828
SO YOU PUT THIS ONE
IN BETH'S NAME.

05:57.828 --> 06:00.360
SO WHAT?
I WAS HER HUSBAND!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.433
AND SINCE
SHE NEVER MADE A WILL...

06:02.433 --> 06:05.696
OH, BUT SHE DID, PAUL,
YEARS AGO.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.968
AND ACCORDING TO THAT WILL,

06:07.968 --> 06:12.773
I OWN THIS HOUSE
AND EVERYTHING IN IT.

06:12.773 --> 06:17.047
OH, MY GOODNESS!
IS THIS A GUSTAV STICKLEY?

06:17.047 --> 06:19.079
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE PEOPLE ON THIS STREET

06:19.079 --> 06:21.081
WANT A MANIPULATIVE PSYCHO
FOR A NEIGHBOR?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.053
WELL, THEY LET YOU LIVE HERE,

06:23.053 --> 06:26.587
SO I'M GUESSING THE ZONING LAWS
AREN'T ALL THAT STRICT.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.160
IF THEY WANNA SHUN ME,
LET THEM.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.823
I WON'T BE ALONE.

06:32.823 --> 06:35.426
I'LL HAVE
MY DAUGHTER WITH ME.

06:36.727 --> 06:39.029
MY GOD.
YOU STOLE HER ASHES?

06:39.029 --> 06:43.704
I DID NOT STEAL THEM. YOU ARE SO
QUICK TO THINK THE WORST OF ME.

06:43.704 --> 06:48.779
I JUST WENT TO THE MAUSOLEUM
AND I EXPLAINED MY LEGAL RIGHTS.

06:48.779 --> 06:50.481
YOUR RIGHTS?

06:50.481 --> 06:53.083
WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS?
SHE WAS MY WIFE!

06:53.083 --> 06:55.085
DID I SAY YOU COULDN'T
VISIT HER?

06:55.085 --> 06:57.648
DROP BY ANYTIME, PAUL.

06:57.648 --> 06:59.920
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

07:11.702 --> 07:14.565
EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT,
SUSAN--

07:14.565 --> 07:16.136
YOUR BLOOD WORK,
CREATINE LEVELS.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.770
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE POSTER GIRL
FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS.

07:19.770 --> 07:23.774
(sighs) DOES THAT MEAN I CAN
HAVE SALTY FOOD AND SEX AGAIN?

07:23.774 --> 07:26.076
SALT IN MODERATION.
YOU SHOULD WAIT TWO MORE WEEKS

07:26.076 --> 07:28.448
BEFORE RESUMING
NORMAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
MIKE AND I HAVE ALREADY
WAITED A MONTH.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.452
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE
ANYTHING NORMAL ABOUT IT.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.925
(laughs)
 OKAY, WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
AT YOUR NEXT CHECKUP.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.927
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

07:36.927 --> 07:39.229
WELL, I AM DEFINITELY
GOING TO THE MALL

07:39.229 --> 07:42.232
TO ENJOY THE LAST FEW HOURS
OF MY HANDICAP PLACARD.

07:42.232 --> 07:44.464
BUT FIRST I'M GOING
TO THE DIALYSIS CENTER

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
TO VISIT MY FRIEND
DICK BARROWS.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.769
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE DIALYSIS CENTER.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.772
HE'S HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE WAS ADMITTED YESTERDAY.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.752
HEY, TALL, DARK,
AND JAUNDICED.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.084
DELFINO. (chuckles)

08:04.084 --> 08:06.486
(door closes)
 COME CLOSER.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.520
I WANNA SEE IF YOU STILL HAVE
THAT NEW KIDNEY SMELL.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.823
(laughs)
 (laughs)

08:12.823 --> 08:14.825
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:14.825 --> 08:17.267
WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GET
A LARGE JAMAICAN NURSE

08:17.267 --> 08:21.031
TO GIVE YOU A SPONGE BATH
FOR 4 GRAND A DAY?

08:21.031 --> 08:22.803
ANOTHER VIRAL INFECTION.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.535
(clicks teeth) I'M SORRY.

08:24.535 --> 08:26.907
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT A KIDNEY SO FAST.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.981
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
ANY MORE SUICIDAL NEIGHBORS

08:30.981 --> 08:32.683
WITH DONOR CARDS?

08:32.683 --> 08:35.015
I DIDN'T LAUGH WHEN YOU WROTE IT
ON MY GET-WELL NOTE,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.886
AND I'M NOT LAUGHING NOW.

08:36.886 --> 08:41.792
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE
THE LUCKIEST PERSON ALIVE.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.153
YOU SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.525
DO YOU GAMBLE?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.197
A LITTLE.

08:47.197 --> 08:50.030
AH. OH-HO, GREAT.
WHEN I GET OUTTA HERE,

08:50.030 --> 08:52.763
I'M TAKING YOU TO THAT CASINO
BY THE AIRPORT.

08:52.763 --> 08:56.166
I'VE NEVER WON IN THAT PLACE.
YOU COULD BE MY RABBIT'S FOOT.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.168
I'M NOT BIG ON CASINOS.

08:58.168 --> 09:01.211
I'M MORE OF
AN AROUND-THE-KITCHEN-TABLE,

09:01.211 --> 09:04.174
GOSSIP-WITH-MY-GIRLFRIENDS,
WIN-ALL-THE-M&M'S KIND OF GAL.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.747
(both chuckle)
 (door opens)

09:06.747 --> 09:10.621
AH, IT'S TIME
FOR MY SPINAL TAP.

09:10.621 --> 09:13.824
YOU SEE? YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY LUCKY ONE.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.691
(door closes)
 HEY, BABE.
YOU'RE HOME LATE.

09:20.691 --> 09:23.293
I GOT CALLED DOWN
TO THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

09:23.293 --> 09:27.698
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:27.698 --> 09:29.900
THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.773
OH, NO. WHAT IS THIS?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.745
THAT, MY DEAR...

09:36.807 --> 09:39.750
IS MY SIGNING BONUS.
 (bottle cap clinks)

09:39.750 --> 09:42.953
$100,000.

09:42.953 --> 09:46.687
NO WAY.
IT IS NOT $100,000.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.788
(whispers) "ONE..."

09:47.788 --> 09:51.261
(gasps)
IT IS. IT'S $100,000!

09:51.261 --> 09:53.794
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

09:53.794 --> 09:56.797
I KNOW! WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO WITH IT?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.098
UM, HOW ABOUT THIS--

09:58.098 --> 10:00.100
GO TO THE BANK,
GET 100,000 SINGLES,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.803
AND ROLL AROUND NAKED ON THEM,
AND THEN APOLOGIZE

10:02.803 --> 10:04.775
TO EVERYBODY AT THE BANK
AND COME HOME!

10:04.775 --> 10:06.677
I LIKE THE NAKED PART.
 OH, MY GOSH!

10:06.677 --> 10:08.338
OH, MY GOSH!

10:08.338 --> 10:11.812
OKAY. OKAY, LET'S THINK.
UM...

10:11.812 --> 10:15.085
OBVIOUSLY, WE SHOULD PUT SOME
IN THE KIDS' COLLEGE FUND,

10:15.085 --> 10:18.618
AND THEN TOP OFF
OUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNT...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.691
OR ACTUALLY START
A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.

10:20.691 --> 10:23.123
DEFINITELY. WE SHOULD
DO ALL OF THAT...

10:23.123 --> 10:24.895
WITH 90 GRAND.

10:24.895 --> 10:27.658
THE OTHER 10
IS FOR YOU TO SPEND

10:27.658 --> 10:29.700
ON SOMETHING FUN
AND TOTALLY FRIVOLOUS,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.703
LIKE A MINK VEST
OR A DIAMOND FRISBEE.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.104
NO, NO, NO...

10:34.104 --> 10:36.667
NO. LYNETTE, DO YOU KNOW
HOW LONG I HAVE WAITED

10:36.667 --> 10:38.709
TO BE ABLE
TO SAY THIS TO YOU?

10:38.709 --> 10:40.811
GO CRAZY.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.373
IT'S ON ME.

10:43.373 --> 10:45.776
FINE.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.748
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
A JERK ABOUT IT,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.649
I'LL SPEND $10,000
ON MYSELF.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.981
AAH!

10:50.981 --> 10:53.223
(laughs)
 WE SHOULD CELEBRATE!

10:53.223 --> 10:54.424
MM. LET'S GO OUT TO DINNER.
 MWAH.

10:54.424 --> 10:58.428
OH, DEFINITELY. BUT NOT TONIGHT.
I'VE GOT A TON OF WORK.

10:58.428 --> 11:01.661
OKAY? HOW ABOUT FRIDAY?
 OKAY. IT'S A DATE.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.993
(chuckles)

11:02.993 --> 11:05.035
WAIT A SEC.

11:05.035 --> 11:06.136
(whispers) "ONE..."

11:06.136 --> 11:11.071
(normal voice)
NOPE. THAT'S $100,000.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.712
AND I'LL CALL.

11:21.712 --> 11:24.414
9, 10, JACK, QUEEN, KING--
A STRAIGHT.

11:24.414 --> 11:26.857
EAT IT!

11:26.857 --> 11:30.420
(chips clinking)
 I WAS GOING TO SAY HOW NICE IT
IS TO HAVE YOU BACK IN OUR GAME,

11:30.420 --> 11:33.093
UNTIL YOU SO CHARMINGLY
TOLD US TO "EAT IT."

11:33.093 --> 11:37.798
FOR THE THIRD TIME.
 I'M SORRY. I'VE JUST
NEVER BEEN THIS HOT BEFORE.

11:37.798 --> 11:41.401
MY FRIEND CALLED IT TODAY.
HE SAID I WAS ON A LUCKY STREAK.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.735
WELL, YOU ARE LUCKY.
YOU GOT A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.777
AND IF YOU TAKE ANY MORE
OF MY MONEY,

11:46.777 --> 11:48.278
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A FACE TRANSPLANT.

11:48.278 --> 11:53.383
(laughs)
 OKAY, IS ANYONE GOING TO NOTICE
WHAT'S DIFFERENT AROUND HERE?

11:53.383 --> 11:55.415
YOU CUT YOUR HAIR?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.417
NO.
 WELL, YOU SHOULD.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.820
I MEAN THE COFFEE.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.722
TOM GAVE ME
PART OF HIS SIGNING BONUS

12:02.722 --> 12:04.795
AND SAID, "GO CRAZY," SO...

12:04.795 --> 12:08.428
I BOUGHT A GRIND AND BREW
COFFEE MASTER.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.101
WASN'T EVEN ON SALE.
CHECK ME OUT.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.034
SHALL I SAY IT?

12:14.034 --> 12:17.007
NO, PLEASE, ALLOW ME.
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

12:17.007 --> 12:19.269
YOU FINALLY GET
A LITTLE MAD MONEY

12:19.269 --> 12:21.241
AND YOU BUY
A KITCHEN APPLIANCE?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.013
BUT I DON'T REALLY
NEED ANYTHING.

12:23.013 --> 12:26.076
OH, HONEY, LOOK AROUND.
YOU NEED EVERYTHING. TWO.

12:26.076 --> 12:29.079
WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME.
TOM'S ONLY HAD THIS JOB A MONTH.

12:29.079 --> 12:31.782
I'M USED TO CLIPPING COUPONS
AND BUYING IN BULK.

12:31.782 --> 12:35.125
I EVEN COLOR MY OWN HAIR.
 AH. MYSTERY SOLVED.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.126
HEY. (clicks teeth)

12:36.126 --> 12:38.158
HOW DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

12:38.158 --> 12:41.261
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
I TRIED. I TRIED FOR YEARS.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.964
I COULDN'T EVEN GET HER
OUT OF FLIP-FLOPS.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.966
OH, MAYBE I CAN
TAKE A SHOT AT HER.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.467
DON'T DO IT.
SHE'LL BREAK YOUR HEART.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.400
(sighs) WELL, I'M BORED.
LOOK, AFTER THIS GAME,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.903
I AM TAKING YOU
TO A CLOTHING STORE...

12:52.903 --> 12:56.076
THAT DOESN'T ALSO SELL
PATIO FURNITURE AND MEAT.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.508
(laughs)
 I'M OUT.

13:03.313 --> 13:06.486
I'LL BET $20.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.458
I'M ALL IN.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.961
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOUR CARDS.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.522
I DON'T NEED TO.

13:12.522 --> 13:15.225
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
VAN DE KAMP?

13:15.225 --> 13:18.168
DID YOU COME TO PLAY?

13:18.168 --> 13:22.302
HUH. LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU ARE MADE OF.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.335
(sighs)

13:25.335 --> 13:29.179
(laughs) THREE KINGS.

13:29.179 --> 13:32.212
OH, LOOK AT ME! I SHOULD BUY
A LOTTERY TICKET RIGHT NOW.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.815
YES, YOU SHOULD, AND THEN
YOU SHOULD "EAT IT."

13:35.815 --> 13:37.547
(laughter)

13:41.391 --> 13:44.424
I SO DON'T BELONG HERE.

13:47.057 --> 13:49.559
(lowered voice)
THAT SALESLADY KNOWS IT, TOO.

13:49.559 --> 13:52.562
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
SHE JUST GAVE ME? COME ON.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.005
WHAT?
 WAIT. (sighs)

13:55.005 --> 13:56.606
UM, EXCUSE ME.

13:56.606 --> 14:00.911
WE'D LIKE
TWO PROSCIUTTO PANINIS

14:00.911 --> 14:03.513
AND A COUPLE
OF ICED CAPPUCCINOS.

14:03.513 --> 14:07.918
THERE'S A CAFé
ACROSS THE STREET.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.450
OH, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GO TO THE ENORMOUS HASSLE

14:10.450 --> 14:14.284
OF BUYING THIS PLACE
JUST TO FIRE YOU.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.587
(clears throat)

14:21.591 --> 14:23.433
NICE.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.635
NOW LET'S GET STARTED.

14:25.635 --> 14:29.599
(gasps) OH, YOU HAVE GOT
TO TRY THESE ON.

14:29.599 --> 14:31.441
NAH. I DON'T--
I DON'T NEED BOOTS.

14:31.441 --> 14:34.874
YOU WILL
ONCE YOU TRY THEM.

14:37.107 --> 14:39.409
AHH.

14:39.409 --> 14:43.583
IT'S LIKE THE BOOT
IS FRENCH KISSING MY FOOT.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.415
WALK AROUND IN THEM.

14:49.459 --> 14:51.491
OH, DEAR.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.294
WHAT THEY ARE DOING
TO MY FEET NOW...

14:54.294 --> 14:57.167
(whispers) I CAN'T EVEN SAY.
 (laughs)

14:57.167 --> 14:59.469
OH.

14:59.469 --> 15:03.073
NOW... TRY THESE.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.975
$500 FOR JEANS?

15:04.975 --> 15:07.978
I WOULDN'T PAY THAT IF THEY
HAD $400 IN THE POCKET.

15:07.978 --> 15:10.480
TRY THEM.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.182
LOOK AT MY ASS!

15:12.182 --> 15:14.444
(gasps) WHERE DID THAT ASS
COME FROM?

15:14.444 --> 15:16.416
IT CAME WITH THE JEANS.
 OHH!

15:16.416 --> 15:18.318
YOU LIKE IT?
 OHH!

15:18.318 --> 15:21.451
YOU SHOULD SEE THE ASS
THAT COMES WITH THE $900 PAIR.

15:21.451 --> 15:22.392
(chuckles)

15:28.158 --> 15:31.131
DO I EVEN WANNA KNOW
HOW MUCH THAT IS?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.163
YOU JUST WANT TO PUT IT ON.

15:33.163 --> 15:37.968
THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING
WITH US, MRS. SCAVO.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.340
UH, THAT DRESS SHOULD BE
ALTERED BY TOMORROW.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.641
WE OPEN AT 10:00.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.643
LET'S MAKE IT 8:00.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.645
AND... BRING CROISSANTS.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.081
HEY, BREE!
 (trunk closes)

15:51.081 --> 15:53.083
I HOPE ANDREW
BROUGHT HIS RAIN GEAR.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.585
I HEAR IT'S GONNA
POUR UP THERE.
 UP WHERE?

15:55.585 --> 15:58.688
THE CABIN.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:58.688 --> 16:00.390
DIDN'T ANDREW TELL YOU?

16:00.390 --> 16:03.463
HE CAME BY THIS MORNING
TO TALK TO CARLOS.
 HE DID?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.435
YEAH, CARLOS WAS JUST
LEAVING FOR A HUNTING TRIP

16:05.435 --> 16:08.438
AND INVITED ANDREW TO COME ALONG
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

16:08.438 --> 16:11.971
ANDREW IS WITH CARLOS
IN THE WOODS WITH GUNS?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.204
I HAVE TO CALL HIM.
 WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

16:14.204 --> 16:16.376
OH, YES,
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.279
HAS ANDREW LOST HIS MIND?
 I TRIED TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT,

16:19.279 --> 16:21.281
BUT HE'S TAKING
THIS A.A. THING SERIOUSLY.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.414
OKAY, SEE, THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WITH SOBRIETY--IT RUINS LIVES.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.356
DAMN IT.
I STILL CAN'T GET THROUGH.

16:26.356 --> 16:29.619
THERE'S NO RECEPTION
UP THERE.
 I'M STARTING TO GET SCARED.

16:29.619 --> 16:31.321
OH, YOU'RE SCARED?

16:31.321 --> 16:33.323
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
RAISING TWO KIDS

16:33.323 --> 16:35.325
WITH A HUSBAND IN JAIL
FOR MURDER!

16:35.325 --> 16:38.168
AND ANDREW'S GAY, SO IT'S A HATE
CRIME. THAT'S TEN MORE YEARS!

16:38.168 --> 16:40.600
LET'S NOT PANIC. IT MAY
NOT BE TOO LATE TO STOP THIS.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.333
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO GET UP THERE.

16:43.333 --> 16:47.307
I'M GONNA SEE
IF LEE CAN WATCH THE GIRLS.
 AND I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING
OUT OF MY NIGHTSTAND.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.310
BREE, AREN'T THERE GONNA BE
ENOUGH GUNS UP THERE?

16:50.310 --> 16:53.483
WHEN ONE OF THEM IS IN MY HANDS,
 THEN THERE'LL BE ENOUGH GUNS.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.455
(doorbell ringing)

17:06.455 --> 17:09.529
I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY I BEHAVED YESTERDAY.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.201
YOU'RE SORRY?

17:11.201 --> 17:14.334
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO REASONS
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.507
I KNEW YOU'D BE UPSET TO FIND
YOU'D BOUGHT ME A HOUSE.

17:17.507 --> 17:20.240
BUT I STILL HAD
TO TWIST THE KNIFE.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.472
I GUESS OLD HABITS
DIE HARD.

17:22.472 --> 17:25.675
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
UPSET ME--THE HOUSE?

17:25.675 --> 17:27.676
AND BETH'S ASHES, OF COURSE,

17:27.676 --> 17:30.420
BUT I WANNA MAKE THAT UP
TO YOU.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.682
YOU'RE GIVING THEM BACK?

17:32.682 --> 17:36.086
NO. I DON'T THINK
EITHER OF US SHOULD KEEP THEM.

17:36.086 --> 17:39.189
I THINK WE SHOULD
SCATTER THEM TOGETHER.

17:39.189 --> 17:41.331
SO YOU'VE PICKED UP
ON THE FACT

17:41.331 --> 17:44.834
THAT I LONG TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH YOU.

17:44.834 --> 17:48.468
THERE'S A PRETTY LITTLE LAKE
ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH OF HERE.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.201
WHEN BETH WAS A GIRL,
IT WAS HER FAVORITE PLACE.

17:51.201 --> 17:53.473
I THINK SHE'D BE HAPPY THERE.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.475
YOU COULD JUST DO THIS
ON YOUR OWN.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.747
WHY DO YOU WANT ME THERE?

17:57.747 --> 17:59.809
BECAUSE BETH LOVED YOU.

17:59.809 --> 18:01.851
IT'S WHAT I THINK
SHE'D WANT.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.416
AND I DON'T HAVE
A CAR YET.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.661
SHALL WE SAY TOMORROW
AROUND 10:00?

18:11.661 --> 18:15.465
10:00 WILL BE FINE.

18:15.465 --> 18:17.467
SHALL I MAKE US
SOME SANDWICHES?

18:17.467 --> 18:19.569
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, FELICIA,

18:19.569 --> 18:21.271
I'LL BRING MY OWN.

18:26.376 --> 18:28.408
(lowered voice)
DICK, ARE YOU AWAKE?

18:28.408 --> 18:30.240
(rustling)

18:30.240 --> 18:31.541
(normal voice) OH, GOOD.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.443
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE LUCKY STREAK.

18:33.443 --> 18:36.586
(curtain rings rattle)
 GUESS WHO WON AT POKER?

18:36.586 --> 18:38.588
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR MY UNCLE DICK?

18:38.588 --> 18:40.590
UH, YEAH.
DID HE GO HOME?

18:40.590 --> 18:42.592
NO, UM...

18:42.592 --> 18:44.754
I'M AFRAID
WE LOST HIM LAST NIGHT.

18:44.754 --> 18:47.527
WHAT?

18:47.527 --> 18:50.330
OH, MY GOD.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.802
YEAH. HE NEVER LET ON
HOW SICK HE WAS.

18:52.802 --> 18:54.634
(sighs)

18:54.634 --> 18:56.536
I'M WALLY, BY THE WAY.

18:56.536 --> 19:00.370
SUSAN.
 SUSAN DELFINO?

19:00.370 --> 19:05.315
UH, HE LEFT
SOMETHIN' FOR YOU.

19:13.883 --> 19:17.827
HE WAS ALWAYS BUGGING ME TO GO
OUT TO THAT CASINO WITH HIM.

19:17.827 --> 19:22.232
NOW I WISH I'D GONE.

19:22.232 --> 19:25.795
(thunderclap)

19:25.795 --> 19:27.467
(door opens)

19:28.638 --> 19:30.870
BREE, GABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.303
HE'S NOT HERE. WHERE'S ANDREW?

19:33.303 --> 19:35.174
HE'S HIKING
OVER BY THE CLIFFS.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.477
IN THE RAIN?
 WELL, IT WASN'T RAINING
WHEN HE LEFT.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.179
WHY'D YOU TWO
COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?
 WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT ANDREW.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.751
BECAUSE HE...
FORGOT HIS MEDICINE.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.454
SO WHEN IS HE GONNA
BE BACK FROM HIS HIKE?

19:44.454 --> 19:48.218
SOON, I HOPE. THOSE ROCKS GET
AWFUL SLIPPERY WHEN THEY'RE WET.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.490
OH, MY GOD! IS THAT BLOOD?
 (gasps)

19:50.490 --> 19:52.592
YEAH, I CUT MYSELF
CHOPPING WOOD.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.825
(gasps) WHAT'S THAT?

19:55.825 --> 19:57.427
A SHOVEL?

19:57.427 --> 19:59.729
WITH FRESH DIRT ON IT!
WHY IS THERE FRESH DIRT?

19:59.729 --> 20:02.201
DAMN IT, CARLOS.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ANDREW?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.674
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 DON'T PRETEND!

20:04.674 --> 20:07.477
WE KNOW HE CAME CLEAN
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER!
 MY MOTHER?

20:07.477 --> 20:09.709
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO RUN HER OVER!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.411
YOU SHOULD BLAME ME!

20:11.411 --> 20:14.384
I'M THE ONE WHO HELPED HIM
GET RID OF THE CAR!

20:14.384 --> 20:16.446
MOM?

20:16.446 --> 20:19.319
ANDREW!

20:19.319 --> 20:20.920
OH, THANK GOD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.653
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 YOU KILLED MY MOTHER?

20:23.653 --> 20:25.825
WHAT? NO. NO, WHO SAID THAT?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.927
WE THOUGHT
 YOU TOLD HIM.

20:27.927 --> 20:32.302
IN THE WOODS ALONE?
WHAT AM I, CRAZY?
 WELL, YOU WEREN'T HERE,
AND WE SAW BLOOD...

20:32.302 --> 20:35.905
AND THE SHOVEL WITH FRESH DIRT!
EXPLAIN THAT!
 DO YOU SEE A BATHROOM IN HERE?

20:35.905 --> 20:39.509
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
 CARLOS! I'M WARNING YOU.
I HAVE A GUN...

20:39.509 --> 20:40.740
IN THE CAR.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.442
(knock on door)

20:42.442 --> 20:43.943
(man) PARK RANGER!

20:45.775 --> 20:48.718
COME IN, PLEASE!

20:50.380 --> 20:52.382
HEY.

20:52.382 --> 20:54.884
SORRY YOU PEOPLE PICKED
SUCH A LOUSY WEEKEND

20:54.884 --> 20:57.787
TO ENJOY OUR PARK HERE.
 ACTUALLY,
WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

20:57.787 --> 21:00.460
OH, 'FRAID NOT.
JUST GOT A RADIO CALL.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.463
BIG OLD PINE TREE JUST FELL
ACROSS THE ACCESS ROAD.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.264
WE CAN'T CLEAR IT UP
TILL TOMORROW.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.037
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SIT TIGHT TILL THEN.

21:08.037 --> 21:11.401
YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO
STAY HERE ALL NIGHT?

21:11.401 --> 21:12.672
YEP!

21:12.672 --> 21:15.044
I GOT A DECK OF CARDS
IN MY TRUCK

21:15.044 --> 21:17.046
IN CASE YOU GET BORED.

21:17.046 --> 21:19.409
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.323
(gasps)

21:35.395 --> 21:37.026
AHH.

21:37.026 --> 21:39.298
HERE. IN CASE YOU'RE PLANNING

21:39.298 --> 21:41.801
TO PUT YOUR CHAMPAGNE
IN A PAINT BUCKET.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.033
I THINK I'M GOOD.

21:44.033 --> 21:45.705
(gasps)

21:45.705 --> 21:47.437
WOW.

21:47.437 --> 21:52.682
THE SAD CATERPILLAR HAS TURNED
INTO AN EXTRAVAGANT BUTTERFLY.

21:52.682 --> 21:54.313
(beeps)

21:54.313 --> 21:57.447
I AM CHECKING TOM'S E.T.A. SO
I KNOW WHEN TO PREHEAT THE OVEN,

21:57.447 --> 21:59.919
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT...
(singsongy) COOKING.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.422
I'M TALKING ABOUT--
 UH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE STOP.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.924
HEY, MR. C.F.O.,
THE KIDS ARE GONE,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.926
THE CHAMPAGNE IS ON ICE,

22:06.926 --> 22:10.930
AND MY BRA ACTUALLY
MATCHES MY PANTIES.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.933
I WAS JUST GONNA CALL YOU.
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.866
I'VE GOT TO GET TO MONTREAL
TONIGHT ON THE JET.

22:16.866 --> 22:18.337
WHAT? NO.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.339
NO, THIS IS
OUR CELEBRATION NIGHT.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.041
CAN'T YOU RESCHEDULE?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.543
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.516
I'M A HERO FOR LANDING
THIS MEETING. I GOT TO BE THERE.

22:26.516 --> 22:28.518
FINE. I'LL TAKE
ANOTHER RAIN CHECK.

22:28.518 --> 22:30.520
YOU'RE STARTING TO OWE ME
A LOT OF RAIN, YOU KNOW?
 (chuckles)

22:30.520 --> 22:32.922
I LOVE YOU. TRAVEL SAFE.

22:32.922 --> 22:35.024
(beep)

22:35.024 --> 22:38.057
(sighs) HEY.
GET YOUR MITTS OFF THAT.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.430
WE'LL HAVE IT TOMORROW
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

22:40.430 --> 22:43.593
OH, LYNETTE. TOMORROW IT'LL BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

22:43.593 --> 22:45.695
TOM IS A BIG SHOT NOW,

22:45.695 --> 22:48.768
AND THE BIGGER HE GETS, THE LESS
YOU'RE GONNA SEE OF HIM.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.541
HEY...

22:51.541 --> 22:54.003
YOU WANT THE CLOTHES
AND THE JEWELRY

22:54.003 --> 22:56.005
AND ALL THE OTHER PERKS.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.808
WELL, THIS IS WHAT
THEY REALLY COST.

23:01.110 --> 23:04.113
(thunder crashing)

23:09.118 --> 23:11.090
(exhales)

23:11.090 --> 23:13.423
YOU CAME TO THE FUNERAL.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.665
WHAT?

23:15.665 --> 23:17.667
MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.169
YOU SAT IN THE SECOND ROW,
BEHIND THE FAMILY,

23:20.169 --> 23:22.101
CONSOLED US ALL.

23:23.773 --> 23:25.775
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

23:25.775 --> 23:28.738
KIND OF... FUNNY?

23:28.738 --> 23:32.612
OF COURSE NOT.
IT WAS VERY AWKWARD.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.085
AWKWARD. GOSH.

23:36.085 --> 23:39.088
SO SORRY HER FUNERAL
WAS SO TOUGH ON YOU.

23:41.991 --> 23:43.993
GOD, I'M SO HUNGRY.

23:43.993 --> 23:46.956
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
DIDN'T BRING ANY FOOD.

23:46.956 --> 23:49.158
ACTUALLY,
I BROUGHT SOMETHING.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.833
THIS IS ALL THE DINNER I NEED.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.134
(bottle cap clatters)

23:55.134 --> 23:58.638
OH, GREAT. WE'VE GOT TENSION
AND FIREARMS. LET'S ADD ALCOHOL.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.209
CARLOS, PLEASE PUT THAT AWAY.

24:00.209 --> 24:02.211
ANDREW'S ONLY BEEN
SOBER A MONTH.

24:02.211 --> 24:03.873
(exhales) I HEARD.

24:03.873 --> 24:06.516
A WHOLE MONTH
WITHOUT A DRINK.

24:06.516 --> 24:08.948
YOU MUST BE THIRSTY.

24:10.019 --> 24:12.882
HELP YOURSELF.

24:14.724 --> 24:18.127
NO, THANKS.
I'M--I'M GOOD.

24:18.127 --> 24:21.160
OKAY,
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

24:21.160 --> 24:26.536
TO MAMA SOLIS.
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

24:26.536 --> 24:29.569
ARE YOU GONNA DRINK TO MY MOM?
OR YOU GONNA INSULT HER MEMORY?

24:29.569 --> 24:33.142
(sighs)

24:33.142 --> 24:36.976
I-I GUESS I'M GONNA
DRINK TO YOUR MOM.
 (whispers) YEAH.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.248
CARLOS, STOP IT. YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY,

24:39.248 --> 24:42.081
BUT PLEASE, THINK OF ALL
THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS.

24:42.081 --> 24:46.716
FRIENDS? YOU THINK
THAT WE'RE STILL FRIENDS?

24:46.716 --> 24:48.718
HOW LONG HAVE I WATCHED YOU

24:48.718 --> 24:51.621
PLAY MISS HIGH-AND-MIGHTY
TO THE WHOLE DAMN STREET?

24:51.621 --> 24:54.624
AND THE WHOLE TIME,
YOU WERE JUST COVERING YOUR ASS!

24:54.624 --> 24:56.596
HEY. GET MAD AT ME,

24:56.596 --> 24:59.098
NOT THE PEOPLE
WHO JUST KNEW ABOUT IT.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.000
PEOPLE?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.003
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THIS?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.535
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

25:05.535 --> 25:07.777
(mouths word)

25:07.777 --> 25:10.109
GABY, WHAT WAS THAT?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.681
NOTHING. IT WAS A MOTH.

25:11.681 --> 25:13.182
(sniffles)

25:14.684 --> 25:16.716
YOU KNEW.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.517
(sighs)

25:18.517 --> 25:20.750
HER I CAN UNDERSTAND,
BUT MY OWN WIFE?

25:20.750 --> 25:24.523
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, CARLOS, LET
IT GO. THIS IS ANCIENT HISTORY.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.526
NOT TO ME.
I MEAN, NOT A DAY WENT BY

25:27.526 --> 25:30.529
THAT I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD
HAVE FOUND THE GUY THAT DID IT.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.563
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE TO
LOOK FAR, DID I?

25:33.563 --> 25:36.065
I WAS TAKING HIM TO BALL GAMES,

25:36.065 --> 25:38.067
INVITING HIS ACCOMPLICE
TO DINNER PARTIES,

25:38.067 --> 25:40.840
AND MY WIFE KNEW.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.172
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU.

25:43.172 --> 25:45.174
WAIT.
CARLOS, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:45.174 --> 25:47.677
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.
I DON'T TRUST MYSELF

25:47.677 --> 25:51.651
TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH YOU PEOPLE.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.228
CARLOS!

25:59.228 --> 26:01.230
CARLOS!

26:03.192 --> 26:04.594
(thunderclap)

26:04.594 --> 26:07.697
CARLOS!

26:10.770 --> 26:12.071
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

26:12.071 --> 26:15.104
PLEASE DISCONTINUE USE
OF ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES

26:15.104 --> 26:17.777
SO WE CAN BEGIN
OUR MEAL SERVICE.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.610
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE OFF.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.612
NOT ANYMORE.

26:22.612 --> 26:24.954
I PUSHED YOUR FLIGHT BACK...
(whispers) HALF AN HOUR.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.656
YOU--WHAT? HOW?

26:26.656 --> 26:29.659
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY YOUR
PILOT'S BACK AT THE TERMINAL,

26:29.659 --> 26:32.591
HAVING COFFEE WITH
A FEW DEAD PRESIDENTS, SO...

26:32.591 --> 26:35.224
NOW IT'S JUST YOU, ME...

26:35.224 --> 26:39.068
(inhales sharply) OH,
AND TWO UNFORTUNATE LOBSTERS.

26:39.068 --> 26:41.070
(sighs)

26:41.070 --> 26:44.804
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN DO ON A PRIVATE JET?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.906
(gasps) ANYTHING.

26:46.906 --> 26:47.907
(sighs)

26:47.907 --> 26:52.041
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING.
(giggles)

26:52.041 --> 26:54.343
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

26:54.343 --> 26:56.185
I KNOW. WHAT A WIFE, HUH?

26:56.185 --> 27:00.089
NO, NO, NO. NO, I MEAN
IT'S REALLY GONNA SCREW ME UP.

27:00.089 --> 27:03.793
I'M SUPPOSED TO SIT DOWN
WITH MY TEAM THE MOMENT I LAND.

27:03.793 --> 27:06.325
I NEED EVERY SECOND
TO PREP FOR THIS MEETING.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.228
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.231
I JUST WANTED YOU TO HAVE
HALF AN HOUR OF FUN.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.234
THANK YOU,
BUT YOU NEED TO REALIZE...

27:15.234 --> 27:17.967
THIS IS FUN.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.812
HONEY, I LOVE THIS JOB.

27:22.812 --> 27:26.375
I HAVE NEVER FELT
SO VALUABLE BEFORE.

27:26.375 --> 27:30.319
I-I WALK INTO A ROOM,
AND PEOPLE STOP TALKING.

27:30.319 --> 27:33.022
THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT TOM THINKS.

27:33.022 --> 27:35.985
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THIS COMPANY IS A ROCKET SHIP.

27:35.985 --> 27:39.058
IT'S TAKING ME
ON THE RIDE OF MY LIFE.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.060
WOW.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.362
THAT'S...

27:43.362 --> 27:47.666
I AM REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

27:47.666 --> 27:51.140
AND DON'T THINK I HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHY I HAVE THIS GIG.

27:51.140 --> 27:54.143
YOU GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE
TO JUMP AT IT,

27:54.143 --> 27:56.145
AND I AM SO, SO GRATEFUL.

27:56.145 --> 27:59.248
THIS IS ALL 'CAUSE OF YOU.

27:59.248 --> 28:01.050
(cell phone ringing)

28:01.050 --> 28:03.182
(both moan)

28:03.182 --> 28:04.884
WHAT? OH.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.185
CAN--CAN... YEAH.
 (ring)

28:06.185 --> 28:07.386
(sighs)

28:07.386 --> 28:09.318
(beep)
 BACK TO FUN?

28:09.318 --> 28:12.361
(buzzing)
 UH, I SHOULD TAKE THIS.
I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I LAND.

28:12.361 --> 28:13.692
(whispers) OKAY.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.695
YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY.
 OH.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.770
HEY. I GOT A LITTLE HUNG UP ON
THE GROUND, BUT I'M ON MY WAY.

28:20.770 --> 28:24.473
WHILE I GOT YOU
ON THE PHONE, UM,

28:24.473 --> 28:28.778
WHO IS GONNA BE IN
ON THIS CONFERENCE CALL?

28:28.778 --> 28:31.040
YEAH--NO. N-N-NOT TED.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.042
I-I WANT TO TRY TO KEEP THIS...

28:40.950 --> 28:43.793
(beeping and whirring)

28:43.793 --> 28:45.094
SUSAN.

28:45.094 --> 28:48.127
ROY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU CAME HERE.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.829
EVERY THURSDAY,

28:49.829 --> 28:52.832
KAREN STICKS 50 BUCKS IN
MY POCKET, PATS ME ON THE BUTT,

28:52.832 --> 28:55.965
AND TELLS ME NOT TO COME HOME
TILL I BLOW IT OR DOUBLE IT.

28:55.965 --> 28:57.907
(chuckles) SO SLOTS?

28:57.907 --> 29:02.111
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THOSE TWO,
BUT I THINK LOTTIE GETS AROUND.

29:02.111 --> 29:04.814
(chuckles) NO. SLOTS.

29:04.814 --> 29:07.917
OH! (chuckles)
OH, YEAH. HEY, SIT DOWN.

29:07.917 --> 29:11.080
OH, THANKS, BUT, UH,
I'M GONNA TRY THE POKER ROOM.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.082
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO IN THERE.

29:13.082 --> 29:15.754
THOSE GUYS ARE JUST
A BUNCH OF SHARKS.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.888
I'M SURE I WON'T BE HERE LONG.
I'M PLAYING FOR A FRIEND.

29:18.888 --> 29:20.890
100 BUCKS?
YOU'RE AN HONEST WOMAN.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.162
WHEN SOMEBODY GIVES ME
 MONEY TO GAMBLE,

29:23.162 --> 29:25.935
I POCKET IT
AND TELL 'EM THEY LOST.

29:25.935 --> 29:27.867
(chuckles)

29:27.867 --> 29:32.201
EXCEPT YOU, LOTTIE.
YOU ACTUALLY LOST.

29:41.050 --> 29:42.051
(chuckles)

29:42.051 --> 29:43.552
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

29:43.552 --> 29:47.216
JUST WONDERING WHAT BETH WOULD
THINK IF SHE COULD SEE US NOW,

29:47.216 --> 29:50.389
DRIVING ALONG LIKE
WE'RE OFF TO A PICNIC.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.022
I THINK SHE'D BE GLAD.

29:53.022 --> 29:55.394
OUR HATE WAS WHAT KILLED HER.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.367
SHE COULDN'T PLEASE EITHER OF US
WITHOUT HURTING THE OTHER,

29:58.367 --> 30:01.100
SO SHE JUST WALKED AWAY.

30:01.100 --> 30:05.975
SO MAYBE SHE'S THINKING,
"OH, GREAT. NOW THEY GET ALONG."

30:05.975 --> 30:08.978
OR "BETTER LATE THAN NEVER."

30:12.211 --> 30:14.113
TELL ME SOMETHING, PAUL.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.414
WHAT?

30:15.414 --> 30:20.149
DID SHE SUFFER AT THE END,
IN HER LAST CONSCIOUS MOMENTS?

30:20.149 --> 30:23.052
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T THERE WHEN SHE DIED.

30:23.052 --> 30:27.496
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN BETH.
I MEANT MY SISTER.

30:27.496 --> 30:30.029
YOU WERE THERE FOR THAT ONE.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.431
FOR GOD SAKES, FELICIA.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.004
I'VE WONDERED
ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS.

30:35.004 --> 30:37.937
I'M NOT WEARING A WIRE, PAUL.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.609
AND I'M NOT GONNA FRISK YOU
TO MAKE SURE, SO LET'S DROP IT.

30:40.609 --> 30:42.111
THINK ABOUT IT.

30:42.111 --> 30:46.015
WE BOTH SAW SOMEONE WE LOVE
BE DESTROYED.

30:46.015 --> 30:50.349
FIRST MY SISTER DROVE
YOUR WIFE TO KILL HERSELF.

30:52.381 --> 30:56.025
YOU ADMIT THAT? FINALLY?

30:56.025 --> 30:58.857
YES, PAUL, I DO.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.031
YOU LOVED YOUR WIFE,

31:02.031 --> 31:04.964
SO YOU KILLED MY SISTER.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.265
I LOVED MY SISTER,

31:06.265 --> 31:10.069
SO I TRIED TO DESTROY YOU,

31:10.069 --> 31:14.273
AND WHO PAID THE PRICE
FOR IT?

31:14.273 --> 31:17.046
BETH.

31:17.046 --> 31:21.410
I JUST HOPE THAT
BY DOING THIS TOGETHER,

31:21.410 --> 31:25.084
WE CAN PUT A STOP
TO THIS AWFUL CYCLE,

31:25.084 --> 31:30.920
AND REACH SOME SORT OF...
CLOSURE.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.297
I'M ALL FOR CLOSURE.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.402
(sighs)

31:43.402 --> 31:47.036
WELL, I LOST MY $50,
BUT I ATE MY WEIGHT IN SHRIMP.

31:47.036 --> 31:50.039
SO ALL IN ALL, A GOOD DAY.
HOW YOU DOING?

31:50.039 --> 31:51.910
I'M OKAY.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.912
YEAH, YOU GOT A LITTLE LEFT.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.016
WHAT'S THAT, 60 BUCKS?
GOOD FOR YOU, KID.

31:57.016 --> 32:01.620
THOSE ARE $1,000 CHIPS.
I'M ALL IN.

32:01.620 --> 32:06.695
$1,000? Y-YOU BET $6,000?
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?!

32:06.695 --> 32:09.058
SHE'S NUTS.
WE'RE TAKING THESE BACK.

32:09.058 --> 32:10.299
HANDS OFF THE TABLE, SIR.

32:10.299 --> 32:13.632
GRANDPA MUST KNOW SOMETHING.
I'LL CALL.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.965
2 PAIR, KINGS OVER 4s.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.173
THREE ACES!
THE KID HAD THREE ACES!

32:24.173 --> 32:28.217
SUSAN, YOU WON OVER $12,000!

32:28.217 --> 32:29.718
I KNOW.

32:29.718 --> 32:31.220
I JUST...
 (chips clinking)

32:31.220 --> 32:32.721
KEEP...

32:32.721 --> 32:34.223
(sniffles)

32:34.223 --> 32:36.955
(voice breaks) WINNING.

32:36.955 --> 32:41.130
(sniffles and cries)

32:41.130 --> 32:45.964
AND YOU CRY EVERY TIME.
YOU'RE WEIRD.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.666
SUSAN, WHAT'S WRONG?

32:47.666 --> 32:49.999
(door opens and closes)
 MY FRIEND...

32:49.999 --> 32:52.601
YOUR FRIEND IS GONNA BE
THRILLED. YOU JUST WON FOR HIM.

32:52.601 --> 32:54.703
HE DIED YESTERDAY.

32:54.703 --> 32:57.106
(sniffles and sighs)

32:57.106 --> 32:59.178
HE WANTED ME TO COME HERE.

32:59.178 --> 33:02.011
HE SAID I WAS
ON A LUCKY STREAK.

33:02.011 --> 33:05.414
AND HE WAS RIGHT. I AM.

33:05.414 --> 33:07.986
BUT... (sighs)

33:07.986 --> 33:11.060
WHY?

33:11.060 --> 33:12.221
(sniffles)

33:12.221 --> 33:16.695
WHY DO I KEEP WINNING
WHILE OTHER PEOPLE LOSE?

33:16.695 --> 33:21.270
AND WHY DID I GET A KIDNEY
WHILE GOOD PEOPLE DIED?

33:21.270 --> 33:23.502
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
(sniffles)

33:23.502 --> 33:29.308
I SERVED IN KOREA
WITH THIS GUY, JOE DANSAK--

33:29.308 --> 33:33.682
FUNNY AS HELL, HE MADE
WHISKEY SOURS IN HIS HELMET.

33:33.682 --> 33:37.616
ONE DAY,
WE'RE OUT ON PATROL.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.549
I FELT SOMETHING
WHIZZ PAST MY EAR,

33:40.549 --> 33:44.623
I TURNED AND LOOKED,
AND JOE WAS ON THE GROUND.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.155
HE WAS DEAD?

33:46.155 --> 33:47.626
YEAH.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.729
THAT NIGHT,
I ASKED THE SERGEANT,

33:50.729 --> 33:53.802
"WHY WAS IT HIM AND NOT ME?"

33:53.802 --> 33:59.208
HE SORT OF SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND SAID, "WHY ASK?"

34:02.771 --> 34:05.814
SO YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL ME...

34:05.814 --> 34:09.678
THAT IT IS... RANDOM.

34:09.678 --> 34:12.050
I'M TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING I CAN

34:12.050 --> 34:15.754
TO GET YOU
TO STOP CRYING, HONEY.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.157
YOU'RE ON A LUCKY STREAK.

34:18.157 --> 34:21.560
WHO KNOWS WHY?
JUST ENJOY IT.

34:21.560 --> 34:26.295
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN MY LUCK RUNS OUT?

34:27.835 --> 34:30.668
I KNOW.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.400
"WHY ASK?"

34:32.400 --> 34:34.342
WHY ASK?

34:36.705 --> 34:39.447
HOW ABOUT RIGHT HERE?
 (exhales deeply)

34:39.447 --> 34:42.411
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HONEY?
IS THIS A GOOD SPOT?

34:42.411 --> 34:45.414
WOULD YOU STOP TALKING TO
THE URN? YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT.

34:45.414 --> 34:46.715
MUST WE BICKER? I THOUGHT

34:46.715 --> 34:49.717
THE POINT OF DOING THIS TOGETHER
WAS TO MAKE A FRESH START.

34:49.717 --> 34:51.719
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT STUPID?

34:51.719 --> 34:55.594
THAT JUST SCATTERING SOME ASHES
IS GONNA MAKE ME TRUST YOU?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.096
UGH. I KNOW
YOU DON'T TRUST ME, PAUL.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.169
IT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT A GUN.

35:00.169 --> 35:01.830
WHAT?

35:01.830 --> 35:03.802
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DENY IT.

35:03.802 --> 35:07.436
OKAY. SO WHAT? YOU SHOW UP
AT MY HOUSE AND SAY,

35:07.436 --> 35:09.738
"HEY, LET'S GO
TO THE WOODS TOGETHER."

35:09.738 --> 35:12.441
I'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO BRING A GUN.

35:12.441 --> 35:16.645
I KNOW... AND I'D BE
CRAZY TO LET YOU KEEP IT.

35:16.645 --> 35:19.418
WHAT?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.790
HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

35:21.790 --> 35:24.653
PRISON'S NOT
A VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE,

35:24.653 --> 35:27.156
BUT I DID PICK UP
A FEW SKILLS.

35:27.156 --> 35:30.429
I JUST BROUGHT THAT
FOR SELF-DEFENSE.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.561
SO NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE YOU?

35:32.561 --> 35:34.833
SEE,
THAT'S OUR PROBLEM, PAUL.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.536
HOW DO YOU TRUST SOMEBODY
WHO DOESN'T TRUST YOU?

35:37.536 --> 35:41.210
YOU FEAR ME, SO YOU BRING A GUN.
I FEAR YOU, SO I TAKE IT.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.741
WHERE DOES IT END?

35:42.741 --> 35:46.245
JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.247
IT COULD END RIGHT HERE

35:48.247 --> 35:50.749
WITH ME SHOOTING YOU
JUST SO I CAN SLEEP EASIER.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.681
GO AHEAD. SHOOT ME.

35:52.681 --> 35:55.754
AT LEAST I'LL DIE KNOWING
YOU'LL ROT IN JAIL FOREVER.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.357
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.690
I'LL PLEAD SELF-DEFENSE.
IT IS YOUR GUN, AFTER ALL.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.793
YOU PULLED IT ON ME,
WE STRUGGLED, IT WENT OFF.

36:04.793 --> 36:08.767
I COULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW
AND GO SCOT-FREE.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.903
OR I COULD DO THIS.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.351
(birds chirping)

36:22.351 --> 36:24.653
I DON'T WANT YOU DEAD,
PAUL.

36:24.653 --> 36:27.316
AND I DON'T WANT US
TO FEAR EACH OTHER.

36:27.316 --> 36:31.420
I JUST WANT THIS OVER.
DON'T YOU?

36:35.324 --> 36:38.767
I THINK YOU SHOULD
DO THE HONORS.

37:04.753 --> 37:08.997
WELL, JUST KEEP LOOKING.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A FOREST.

37:08.997 --> 37:12.831
FINALLY! NEXT TIME YOU DROP
YOUR GIRLS OFF FOR A FEW HOURS,

37:12.831 --> 37:15.404
YOU MIGHT MENTION
YOU MAY NOT BE HOME THAT NIGHT.

37:15.404 --> 37:17.736
THE ROADS WERE CLOSED.
WE WERE TRAPPED IN THE WOODS.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.008
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. COULD
HAVE BEEN AT MY DINNER PARTY

37:20.008 --> 37:22.010
WHEN I TRIED
TO SERVE THE TIRAMISU

37:22.010 --> 37:25.013
AND THE "TIRA"
HAD BEEN LICKED OFF.
 LOOK, LEE, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

37:25.013 --> 37:27.716
MY GUESTS WERE ANOTHER
GAY COUPLE WHO WERE THINKING

37:27.716 --> 37:29.718
OF ADOPTING A CHILD.
(whispers) THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE.

37:29.718 --> 37:32.321
LEE, CUT ME SOME SLACK.
MY HUSBAND IS MISSING.

37:32.321 --> 37:34.753
DON'T TRY TO PLAY ME.
CARLOS CALLED THIS MORNING.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.725
HE DID?

37:36.725 --> 37:38.827
YEAH. HE ASKED
IF I COULD WATCH THE GIRLS

37:38.827 --> 37:41.530
FOR A FEW MORE HOURS
WHILE HE DROVE OUT TO LITTLETON.

37:41.530 --> 37:43.832
I SAID, "WHY NOT? I HAVE
VERY FEW BREAKABLES LEFT."

37:43.832 --> 37:45.834
WHAT'S HE DOING
OUT IN LITTLETON?

37:45.834 --> 37:47.896
I KNOW. COME ON.

37:47.896 --> 37:49.898
WHAT? NO, WAIT.
GABY, WAIT!

37:52.671 --> 37:55.043
I'M HUNGRY.

37:55.043 --> 37:56.705
(car engine starts)

37:56.705 --> 37:58.407
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

37:58.407 --> 37:59.778
(sighs)

37:59.778 --> 38:02.781
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW
THAT PAUL WAS VERY TOUCHED

38:02.781 --> 38:04.783
WHEN WE SCATTERED THE ASHES.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.486
HE EVEN TEARED UP
A LITTLE AT THE END.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.787
'COURSE...

38:08.787 --> 38:13.692
HE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY YOU
IN THE URN...

38:13.692 --> 38:17.326
NOT JUST SOME SWEEPINGS
FROM THE FIREPLACE.

38:19.598 --> 38:23.602
BUT I WOULD NEVER
SCATTER YOU IN THE WOODS.

38:23.602 --> 38:27.906
NO. YOU'RE GOING TO STAY
WHERE YOU BELONG,

38:27.906 --> 38:32.310
RIGHT HERE...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.813
WITH ME.

38:34.813 --> 38:38.717
AND DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT PAUL.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.720
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.793
BUT NOT JUST
BY SHOOTING HIM, NO.

38:44.793 --> 38:47.696
THAT'S TOO QUICK, TOO...

38:47.696 --> 38:49.658
MERCIFUL.

38:49.658 --> 38:52.361
NO.

38:52.361 --> 38:57.035
DEATH IS THE EASY WAY OUT.

38:57.035 --> 39:01.740
BUT LOOK WHO I'M TELLING.

39:05.514 --> 39:08.517
OH, CARLOS...

39:08.517 --> 39:10.749
THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.652
YOU REALLY SCARED US.

39:13.652 --> 39:18.587
AW. FLOWERS FOR YOUR MOM.
HOW SWEET.

39:18.587 --> 39:21.660
SAVE IT, GABY.
YOU NEVER LIKED HER.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.632
(sighs)

39:23.632 --> 39:26.895
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:26.895 --> 39:29.898
MAYBE I DIDN'T SEE WHY SHE HAD
TO BE IN YOUR LIFE SO MUCH,

39:29.898 --> 39:32.901
WHY SHE COULDN'T JUST LET GO.

39:32.901 --> 39:35.904
BUT I WASN'T A MOTHER YET.

39:35.904 --> 39:39.608
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU NEVER LET GO.

39:39.608 --> 39:41.780
LISTEN, UH, CARLOS...

39:41.780 --> 39:45.714
WE ARE SO DEEPLY SORRY
FOR WHAT WE DID.

39:45.714 --> 39:48.887
ANDREW WAS ONLY 16
AND ALREADY ABUSING ALCOHOL,

39:48.887 --> 39:51.520
A HABIT THAT HE LEARNED
FROM ME, SO I--

39:51.520 --> 39:53.462
QUIET, M-MOM, PLEASE.

39:53.462 --> 39:56.895
I'M JUST TRYING TO DEFEND YOU.
 I KNOW. I KNOW.
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.769
AND I'VE LET YOU. THAT'S WHY
MY LIFE HAS BEEN SUCH A MESS,

40:00.769 --> 40:04.603
BUT I NEED TO DO THIS.
THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND CARLOS.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.576
JUST PLEASE,
WAIT IN THE CAR, OKAY?
 (whispers) BUT, ANDREW--

40:07.576 --> 40:09.938
THE CAR, MOM!

40:11.910 --> 40:15.484
BREE, LET'S GO TO THE CAR.

40:20.749 --> 40:23.752
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS RIGHT.

40:23.752 --> 40:27.696
YOU CAN SUE ME.
YOU CAN GO TO THE POLICE.

40:27.696 --> 40:30.529
WHATEVER IT TAKES. (sighs)

40:30.529 --> 40:33.962
I KNOW THIS MUST HURT.

40:33.962 --> 40:36.835
I'M NOT HURT.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.107
I'M PROUD.

40:42.571 --> 40:44.112
SIT DOWN.

40:47.816 --> 40:50.619
YES, WHENEVER WE MAKE MISTAKES,

40:50.619 --> 40:52.581
WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE,

40:52.581 --> 40:56.555
AND THEN WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

40:58.657 --> 41:02.691
WE MUST TRY TO ACCEPT
THE CHANGES IN OUR LIVES...

41:07.736 --> 41:11.840
OR CHOOSE TO TRUST
AN OLD ENEMY...

41:13.742 --> 41:19.678
OR LEARN TO STOP FIGHTING
OUR CHILDREN'S BATTLES.

41:19.678 --> 41:24.653
BUT SOMETIMES THE PAIN
WE'VE CAUSED IS SO GREAT,

41:24.653 --> 41:27.616
THERE IS NO MOVING ON.

41:27.616 --> 41:31.119
CARLOS, I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR FORGIVING ANDREW.

41:31.119 --> 41:35.093
YOU ARE A GENEROUS MAN,
AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU.

41:37.526 --> 41:39.127
(sighs) MAY I COME IN?

41:39.127 --> 41:41.630
YOU CAN GO TO HELL.
 CARLOS.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.972
EXCUSE ME?

41:43.972 --> 41:46.935
I DID FORGIVE ANDREW. HE WAS
A KID THAT MADE A MISTAKE,

41:46.935 --> 41:48.937
BUT YOU WERE AN ADULT--
MY FRIEND--

41:48.937 --> 41:51.610
WHO COVERED UP FOR HIM.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.781
CARLOS, PLEASE--

41:52.781 --> 41:54.282
MNH-MNH. LISTEN CAREFULLY,

41:54.282 --> 41:57.285
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST THING
I AM EVER GOING TO SAY TO YOU.

41:57.285 --> 41:59.848
WE ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS,
NOT YOU AND ME,

41:59.848 --> 42:02.691
AND NOT YOU AND GABY.
 YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR ME.

42:02.691 --> 42:04.192
I JUST DID.

42:07.596 --> 42:09.628
NO BARBECUES,

42:09.628 --> 42:12.100
NO COCKTAIL PARTIES,
NO POKER GAMES.

42:12.100 --> 42:15.704
YOU ARE NOT EVEN TO WAVE
TO US ON THE STREET.

42:15.704 --> 42:18.567
THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

42:23.171 --> 42:25.644
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MUFFINS.

42:28.276 --> 42:29.778
(door closes)
