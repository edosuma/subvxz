at the last minute

three ways instead of four.

the up-charging starts,

And don't get a stripper
on the holidays

add in surge pricing.

08:38.648 --> 08:41.477
I own a house.
You see these awards?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.610
Just accolades, accolades,
accolades, right?

08:43.653 --> 08:46.134
Keisha's biggest achievement
is getting peed on in a movie.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.223
I mean, she still smells
like Tiffany Haddish.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.181
All right, this is
a very bougie rant.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.227
I'm just saying
that I am proud of hard I work.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.534
And look, Kenan is proud
of you, too, queen.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.970
Thanks.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.059
But, I don't know,
maybe you're in your feelings,

08:58.102 --> 08:59.582
and you're not dealing with it,

08:59.626 --> 09:02.019
so you're making everybody work
all these crazy hours.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.978
And people are not happy
about it.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.414
"People"?

09:05.457 --> 09:08.156
People who work
on the number two morning show?

09:08.199 --> 09:11.072
Huh. Who, Kenan, who?
[laughs]

09:11.115 --> 09:12.726
Give me names.

09:12.769 --> 09:15.555
I don't know, I think maybe
Phil was saying something

09:15.598 --> 09:17.774
about his check or something,
I don't know.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.167
You know what?
I got this.

09:19.210 --> 09:22.474
No, you don't.
You don't have to get this.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.650
Mika, come back!

09:23.693 --> 09:26.174
Show me some more
fancy handbags, queen!

09:26.217 --> 09:28.176
I mean, it's too much.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.134
It is late.
- I'm so tired.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.396
- Yeah.
- Hey, everybody.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.615
Kenan told me that you're upset

09:32.659 --> 09:33.834
that we're working
late tonight,

09:33.877 --> 09:35.836
so I want you to go home
and get some rest.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.272
- Oh.
- [sighs]

09:37.315 --> 09:38.752
Because we're working
the weekend.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.710
Oh, thanks a lot, Kenan.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.756
Hey, you wanted
a night off, right?

09:42.799 --> 09:46.063
So I delivered.
- Mika, you're crazy.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.848
I'm not working the weekend.

09:47.891 --> 09:48.979
What did you say?

09:49.023 --> 09:51.591
I said you're crazy.

09:51.634 --> 09:52.722
Just 'cause you don't
have a life

09:52.766 --> 09:54.855
doesn't mean
you have to ruin ours.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.552
- Ooh.
- Okay.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.380
Okay, let's calm down
a little bit here.

09:58.423 --> 10:01.078
Everybody's friends here now.
- Yeah, best friends.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.211
- Phil.
- Phil.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.865
Work is way more important

10:04.908 --> 10:06.997
than barfing around the streets
with your friends, okay?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.173
So we are gonna eat, breathe,
and sleep this show

10:09.217 --> 10:11.741
until we're number one.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.917
- Okay.
- No.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.440
I am gonna eat food,

10:15.484 --> 10:17.138
I am gonna breathe air,

10:17.181 --> 10:18.400
and I am gonna sleep

10:18.443 --> 10:21.055
on a cool-ass
adjustable hospice bed

10:21.098 --> 10:24.232
that I just got
at an estate sale.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.495
Pamela, if you don't
come in this weekend,

10:26.538 --> 10:29.280
don't bother coming in tomorrow
or any day after that.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.022
Hey, long weekend.
Look at that.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.677
That's a compromise, right?
This is a good day.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.332
Shall we get some scones, or--
- No.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.160
I meant don't come in
ever again.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.684
- Are you firing me?
- Come on, Pam.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.034
Nobody's firing anybody.
- Pam, you're fired.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.558
[gasps]

10:46.602 --> 10:48.648
Damn, she just fired Pam.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.782
[laughter]
- What?

10:52.826 --> 10:54.001
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.524
You still got R. Kelly
on your playlist?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.744
- I know, he's a monster.
- Yeah.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.007
But he also made me believe
that I could fly.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.399
But you can't fly though.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.879
Deleted.
[both laugh]

11:02.923 --> 11:04.838
All right, but if you're
getting rid of that,

11:04.881 --> 11:08.232
I am getting rid of...

11:08.276 --> 11:09.886
the Shaq album!

11:09.930 --> 11:12.802
Okay, you not about to play
with "Shaq Fu" like that.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.978
- No!
- He gave you slam dunking...

11:15.022 --> 11:16.284
- No, he didn't.
- Being a ninja...

11:16.327 --> 11:17.589
Mm-mm.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.721
And a police officer
in a random town.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.940
- Well--
- Come on now.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.593
He might have
a personality disorder.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.118
Also, hold on, you can't judge

11:24.161 --> 11:26.729
because you have
Michael Jackson

11:26.773 --> 11:28.513
and then
Donald Trump's audiobook,

11:28.557 --> 11:29.558
"The Art of the Deal."

11:29.601 --> 11:31.125
Is this your canceled playlist?

11:31.168 --> 11:35.129
Yes, and my list of people
who can't read that well.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.522
[both laugh]

11:37.566 --> 11:39.089
Ugh.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.222
<i>[Muni Long's "Hrs and Hrs"]</i>

11:41.265 --> 11:44.094
Well, I mean,
I think it's time

11:44.138 --> 11:47.184
that you--um...
- [laughing]

11:47.228 --> 11:50.927
I mean, I think it's time
that you...

11:50.971 --> 11:54.452
- Mm-hmm?
- Should have some water.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.064
Do you ever drink water?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.196
I mean, don't most people?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.633
Right, well,
I'ma get you some

12:01.677 --> 12:02.765
so that you stay hydrated.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.767
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.290
You sit tight.
- Okay.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.250
Don't go nowhere.
I shall be but a minute.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.296
I don't know why I did that.
[both laugh]

12:12.340 --> 12:13.776
All right.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.864

12:28.617 --> 12:29.792
to get your power back, huh?

12:29.836 --> 12:31.663
Yeah, of course.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.231
Absolutely, yeah.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.017
About to,
soon as I give her this water.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.323
She gon' be on her way.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.108
Kenan!

12:41.151 --> 12:44.241
Hi. Carrie.
Sorry, big fan.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.721
[laughs]

12:45.765 --> 12:46.896
You're so much taller
in person.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.724
Why, thank you very much.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.073
- [laughs]
- And here's your water.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.120
Oh, and thank you.
Bye, guys.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.341
And you should leave
and drive safe.

12:57.385 --> 13:01.824
Go on, get on out of here
and drive cautiously.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.132
You think that qualifies
as asking her to leave?

13:05.175 --> 13:06.786
And she done took
one of my good glasses.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.004
Boy, what's going on with you?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.832
I've tried
to kick this woman out, man,

13:09.876 --> 13:11.399
but I can't.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.748
Oh, I get it.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.924
You think this is
about getting your power back,

13:14.968 --> 13:17.274
but you sprung.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.756
Since the first night, man.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.369
All I wanted to do
was stay over and cuddle.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.110
What do I do?

13:27.154 --> 13:30.374
Help me.
- Just tell her that.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.550
Tell her how you get lost
in her eyes

13:32.594 --> 13:34.030
whenever you see her

13:34.074 --> 13:36.119
or how your heart skips a beat
when she enters the room.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.556
Man, that is corny as hell.
I'm not saying that.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.036
Yeah, well, maybe it is,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.995
but you been swiping through
these streets for years,

13:42.038 --> 13:44.084
and I have never seen you
like this.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.564
You were singing Michael Bublé
in the shower the other day.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.870
I know.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.090
I was experiencing
a Bublé level of emotions,

13:50.133 --> 13:54.007
all light jazz
and tight Zara suits.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.878
But what if she don't want
to stay the night, though?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.401
Well, then,
you come back and pretend

13:57.445 --> 13:58.925
you didn't like her
in the first place,

13:58.968 --> 14:00.927
and I pretend to believe you
'cause I'm your brother.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.017
Thanks, fam.
You a real one for that.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.802
I'ma go to bed real quick.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.977
You 'bout to go see
if she's still

14:08.021 --> 14:09.239
in the driveway, ain't you?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.198
No, no,
I'm not even gonna do that.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.069
- All right.
- That's a stupid idea.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.984
Okay, then why are you
running to the front door?

14:15.028 --> 14:19.075
Mm-mm-mm,
the pitifulness of yourself.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.511
Okay, come on, Mika.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.557
You made your point,
but you gotta get Pam back.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.212
No, all I gotta do is
pay taxes and stay cute.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.083
Yeah, but Pam is family,

14:27.127 --> 14:29.042
and the good kind
of family, too.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.913
She would never steal
your social security number

14:30.957 --> 14:32.045
and go buy a car.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.568
- Ooh...
- Yeah, that was Gary.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.613
Okay, Kenan, can we talk
about this after the show?

14:35.657 --> 14:36.919
You're on in one minute.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.225
Oh, forget about the show
for one second.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.270
Work isn't all there is, Mika.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.098
You know what,
it might be easier for you

14:42.142 --> 14:44.187
to understand that
if there was no show.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.449
What are you talking about?

14:45.493 --> 14:48.931
I'm not working
until you bring Pam back!

14:48.975 --> 14:51.238
Excuse me?

14:51.281 --> 14:53.066
I--that's what
my mouth just said,

14:53.109 --> 14:55.459
and I believe I concur.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.461
This is for Pam.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.723
[joints crack]

14:58.767 --> 15:01.030
I heard something pop!

15:01.074 --> 15:02.858
Yeah, I need to get back up.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.555
But I believe I made my point.
- Mm-hmm.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.644
Come on, help me up, girl.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.907
Appreciate you.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.821
I'll just stay down here
all day, then.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.694
Can somebody call
LeBron's doctor?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.000
I need new knees.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.265
Kenan, I ain't playing
with you.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.310
Get to work.
- No. No.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.834
Not until you agree
to talk to Pam.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.533
Kay. Kay, fine.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.491
Tami, guess what?
You got your wish.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.363
The show is now yours.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.451
Really?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.801
No, Tami, Tami,
think about Pam.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.543
Tami.
- Tami.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.110
- Tami.
- I'm so torn.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.242
This is just like
when I divorced my parents.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.331
You don't want it like this.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.378
You're right.
I choose Pam.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.075
She would never spend
my pageant winnings

15:46.119 --> 15:47.598
on beef jerky and Mountain Dew.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.253
Kay. Kay, fine.
Phil!

15:50.297 --> 15:53.343
Oh, geez, please no.
I'm a fourth banana at best.

15:53.387 --> 15:54.736
What's a fourth banana?

15:54.779 --> 15:56.477
I don't know.
Maybe it's sexual.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.522
Okay, you know what?
Hey, you!

15:58.566 --> 16:00.611
The show is now "Wake Up
with What's-Your-Name."

16:00.655 --> 16:01.786
What's your name?
- Beck.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.223
But I'm sleeping with Pam.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.268
Also, we're on in 30 seconds.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.835
Okay, okay, so nobody?

16:06.878 --> 16:08.663
Nobody cares about the show?
Hmm?

16:08.706 --> 16:10.491
Not as much
as we care about Pam.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.362
Would you please go talk
to her?

16:12.406 --> 16:14.103
And say what,
that she was right?

16:14.147 --> 16:16.758
That I put work before
my friends until I had none?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.629
And my life is so sad,
I asked my Postmate

16:18.673 --> 16:19.804
to watch "Queen's Gambit"
with me.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.197
She was like, "Uh, not again.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.677
Not again."

16:22.720 --> 16:24.896
Now I'm dragging you all
with me.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.507
Well, I wouldn't mention
the Postmate part.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.638
That's rock bottom.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.163
But the rest of that
was pretty good.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.773
I am so sorry.

16:31.816 --> 16:34.341

16:34.384 --> 16:35.690

16:35.733 --> 16:38.040
Welcome to "Wake Up with Tami."

16:38.084 --> 16:39.389
Finally.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.043
She slid out there
halfway through your rant.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.959
- Yeah, she was quick.
- Girl can't even help herself.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.352
both: Tami!

16:45.395 --> 16:47.441
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

16:47.484 --> 16:48.485
You think Pam will
forgive me?

16:48.529 --> 16:50.313
I was pretty awful to her.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.576
Yeah. I mean, it's Pam.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.970
She's super reasonable.
- Okay.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.493
Huah!

16:59.148 --> 17:00.715
Ah!
- [groans]

17:00.758 --> 17:02.717
both: Oh.
- MY bad, bitch!

17:02.760 --> 17:05.720
Hey, tell your wife I got her
while you heal up.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.069
All right, well,
everybody knows

17:07.113 --> 17:08.549
that trash talk is a big part
of tennis.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.898
- Is it?
- Limp faster, Kip!

17:10.942 --> 17:14.990
This is Pam's house!
Pam's house!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.862
- Hey, Pam--
- Who wants some?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.169
Oh, Kenan, sorry.
I was in beast mode.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.215
Yeah, yeah, we saw you
serve Kip up that vasectomy.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.305
Not on me.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.436
Mika.
- Hi.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.873
What do you want?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.224
To talk about last night.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.964
Well, I only have the court
for an hour,

17:33.008 --> 17:36.446
so if you wanna talk,
we talk in my house.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.581
Oh, but I'm in heels, so...

17:40.624 --> 17:44.106
- Kip, run those shoes!
- Hm?

17:44.150 --> 17:47.370
Oh, he doesn't have
to do that--okay.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.156
He'll do whatever I ask.
Hey, Kip!

17:50.199 --> 17:51.896
Bring me a $20 bill!

17:53.028 --> 17:55.248
He's gonna bring me $20.
- Oh.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.119
Want one?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.688
[laughing]

18:02.472 --> 18:04.431
Okay, strip.

18:04.474 --> 18:08.130
Okay, but can we talk first?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.785
Oh, no, baby,
you're not pregnant, are you?

18:10.828 --> 18:12.439
'Cause I swear it's not mine.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.962
[laughs]

18:14.005 --> 18:15.833
You're so funny, man.
I love you.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.140
- What?
- Huh?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.968
- What?
- No, mm-mm.

18:20.011 --> 18:23.319
What I was gonna say is,
I think after we do the thing,

18:23.363 --> 18:26.931
we should watch TV together
and take a long nap,

18:26.975 --> 18:28.716
and then wake up the next day

18:28.759 --> 18:31.458
and have some cheesy eggs
and some juice,

18:31.501 --> 18:33.155
something like that.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.592
You're saying you want
to stay the night,

18:35.636 --> 18:38.421
and then eat breakfast?

18:38.465 --> 18:41.163
Uh, sure.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.296
Definitely, I think.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.775
Oh.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.995
I mean, I figured you just
wanted something casual.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.649
I mean, we met
on Impromptu-Vous.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.520
I'm sure I wasn't
your first vous.

18:50.564 --> 18:54.568
No, no, but...

18:54.611 --> 18:56.787
look, you're the only girl
with a smile

18:56.831 --> 18:58.789
that made my heart skip a beat.

18:58.833 --> 19:02.880
Aw, Gary, that's hella corny.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.012
Man.

19:04.055 --> 19:07.494
[laughs]
But it's also kinda sweet.

19:07.537 --> 19:08.843
For real?

19:08.886 --> 19:11.193
So you'd be down
for more than just hooking up?

19:11.237 --> 19:12.977
Yeah.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.155
You wanna cuddle?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.853
Hell no,
I don't wanna--hell yeah!

19:18.896 --> 19:21.029
I'm little spoon!
- What--aww!

19:21.072 --> 19:24.467
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.165
It was hard for you
to say that.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.775
- It was.
- It was.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.646
I almost farted
right in the middle of it.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.128
[both grunting]

19:33.172 --> 19:35.739
Okay.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.524
Okay, all right, next one.
I got the next one.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.134
Here we go, and--
- Huah!

19:39.178 --> 19:42.703
Just--oh! Okay.
Didn't get that one either.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.184
Do they always come
this fast, or--

19:45.227 --> 19:46.750
Okay.
- All right, come on, Pam.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.057
Ease up. Hear her out.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.668
Fine!
I'll go lefty. Talk.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.193
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Pam.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.283
Okay, I never should have
fired you.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.764
Look, my friends
really hurt my feelings,

20:00.808 --> 20:03.376
but they were right,
and so were you.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.595
I need to work a little less.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.381
- Huah!
- Okay, a lot less. A lot less.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.818
I definitely need to find
a work-life balance.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.689
Look, can we stop now?

20:12.733 --> 20:14.256
I'm meeting my sorors
for dinner,

20:14.300 --> 20:17.694
and I don't wanna
sweat out my silk press!

20:17.738 --> 20:19.566
Wait.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.655
You're going out
instead of working?

20:21.698 --> 20:23.744
Yeah, I told you,
you're right.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.099
- Pam, Pam, Pam--
- No, Pam, don't hurt her!

20:31.142 --> 20:33.057
[both grunt]

20:33.101 --> 20:36.713
Aww, love. Just like tennis.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.063
[laughs]
Man, I am funny.

20:39.107 --> 20:42.110
Really worked up
a sweat there, huh, buddy?

20:42.153 --> 20:45.026
- I skew moist.
- Let me get in on this.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.288
both: Aww.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.292
- Oh, you are moist.
- Yeah.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.862
Should we hit the showers?
- I'm out.

20:54.905 --> 20:58.561
- As a group, or...
- I mean, whatevs.

20:58.605 --> 21:02.130
Okay, well, shower for one.
Jealous?
