WEBVTT

00:30.760 --> 00:32.635
Come on, let's get your mother.

00:32.719 --> 00:34.320
I'm doing my homework.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.840
This is for adults, Pableras.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.200
- Isn't the talking car show on?
- It was on already.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.079
Then let's take a spin in the real KITT.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.116
All that's different is the color.
Otherwise, it's the spitting image.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.000
- I'd rather walk.
- Walk?

00:57.439 --> 01:01.075
You're too young to see the freedom
and independence a car gives you.

01:01.159 --> 01:02.719
Go on, go.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.756
You'll see when you turn 18
and run to the driving school.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.879
- I prefer the bus.
- The bus?

01:17.480 --> 01:18.956
The bus has timetables, son.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.116
It has delays, it doesn't come
sometimes and leaves you stranded.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.875
And you can take your car
whenever and wherever you want.

01:23.959 --> 01:27.715
I can read on the bus and I get carsick.

01:27.799 --> 01:30.480
Why do you want to read
if you're in KITT?

01:31.359 --> 01:34.275
KITT, how are you?

01:34.359 --> 01:37.439
Great. I see you're in
fine company today.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.640
Yes, Pableras is here.
He says you're not that fantastic.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.435
I reach a speed of 250 km/h.

01:45.519 --> 01:46.916
I drive by myself.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.050
And as you can see, Pablo,
I talk as well.

01:49.519 --> 01:52.155
KITT, take us to pick up Pablo's mother,

01:52.239 --> 01:54.476
she's doing the shopping
and she's loaded down.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.159
Of course.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.879
Come on, foot down, foot down.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.680
Do you realize that the expressions
"downhill" and "uphill"

02:14.000 --> 02:15.159
are both bad?

02:16.120 --> 02:18.355
One could be good, I'd say.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.235
No, they're both bad.

02:20.319 --> 02:23.479
To you this hill is an uphill battle.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.120
But the opposite is to master it.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.036
To go up without the car stalling.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.240
The opposite isn't a downhill ride.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.840
Language is so capricious, professor.

02:37.599 --> 02:38.716
Go on, first.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.756
Find the vibrato. Vibrato.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.759
Lift it up, up, up. Help...

02:43.159 --> 02:46.596
Okay, "it's fine, we've got Arconada".

02:46.680 --> 02:48.560
Start her up again. Go.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.436
- Let's go.
- Why the fuck are they honking?

02:51.520 --> 02:52.879
You focus on your car.

02:54.199 --> 02:56.115
- Start her up.
- It's a driving school car.

02:56.199 --> 02:57.919
Start her up. Take no notice.

02:58.319 --> 03:01.075
Let's go. Start her up.

03:01.159 --> 03:03.515
Alright, first. Now we go
to the vibrato and I'll help you.

03:03.599 --> 03:05.675
Go on, go on. Up, up. That's it.

03:05.759 --> 03:10.159
That's it. There.
Easy and for the whole family.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.916
Now that we're on
the chapter about hills...

03:14.000 --> 03:17.439
Do you know how to go
down a hill and with snow?

03:18.039 --> 03:18.960
No.

03:19.479 --> 03:20.520
In a sled.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.159
In a sled, sure.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.639
In a sled, because otherwise...

03:31.960 --> 03:38.120
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

03:42.599 --> 03:43.835
Pablo, don't go.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.680
You have to tell me
the classes for next week.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.235
Next week... I'll call you.

03:51.319 --> 03:52.439
I'll call you.

03:54.479 --> 03:56.355
What's up with the professor?

03:56.439 --> 03:59.476
I don't know, but I get the idea
he's not coming back.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.635
That hill gets him down.

04:01.719 --> 04:05.240
But he'll be back, Elisita, you'll see.
He'll be back.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.599
Hills are a climb for him.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.355
Lopetegui!

04:12.439 --> 04:13.639
Relay!

04:19.639 --> 04:21.519
How are the classes going?

04:23.279 --> 04:26.315
- So-so.
- Aren't they expensive?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.636
I'll only be able to afford
a few more of them.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.355
Just as well Lucía teaches me
on the sly, otherwise...

04:31.439 --> 04:34.875
- Don't tell Lorenzo.
- Relax, you know what Lorenzo's like.

04:34.959 --> 04:37.059
I don't speak in his classes,
only he does.

04:37.879 --> 04:40.596
He really likes chewing the fat.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.355
- Chewing the fat?
- Yes, gabbing.

04:43.439 --> 04:45.435
No, I know, I know what it is.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.995
It's been 30 years since I heard
"chew the fat".

04:48.079 --> 04:50.036
I say it a lot.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.555
Hey, if you fancy coming one day
to practice with the car,

04:52.639 --> 04:54.519
we do it in the carpark near college.

04:55.279 --> 04:56.956
No. Did you find my book for class?

04:57.040 --> 04:59.076
Yes, in the end
I bought it on the Internet.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.995
- But there were two.
- Two what?

05:01.079 --> 05:04.956
Two books, this one, but a novel too

05:05.040 --> 05:09.315
called "The Chances of the Living",
from yonks ago.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.555
- Is it yours?
- No.

05:11.639 --> 05:14.276
There are lots of people with my surname.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.435
And they write books
and are called Pablo.

05:17.519 --> 05:19.720
Yes, fewer of them. But there are, yes.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.079
So it's not your novel.

05:22.439 --> 05:24.235
Then I won't buy it.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.920
- Good, it's awful.
- How do you know?

05:27.759 --> 05:30.476
I didn't write it, but I've read it.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.920
Lorenzo's waiting for you.
You'll be late, Yolanda. Go on.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.920
My Internet's not working at home.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.716
Shouldn't you warn me before coming?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.115
I called, but you must've been
in the driving class.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.149
- How are you?
- No, you didn't call me.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.995
Yes, you did call me.

05:51.079 --> 05:52.399
Twice.

05:58.199 --> 05:59.120
Do you mind?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.516
- No.
- Then...?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.360
Iria, we were going to
stop doing these things.

06:06.439 --> 06:09.480
Remember I put a wedge
in this table so that this...

06:10.120 --> 06:11.360
wasn't so annoying?

06:11.959 --> 06:14.396
- Are you staying for lunch?
- Can we do that?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.040
If you cook, yes.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.315
Don't you have a plan?

06:20.399 --> 06:22.755
People who split up have plans,
they go partying...

06:22.839 --> 06:24.800
You split up too, and here you are.

06:25.199 --> 06:26.759
I have a plan for later.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.120
My friends were your friends,
naturally they chose you.

06:35.199 --> 06:36.959
Well, make some new friends.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.680
I'm too old for that.

06:40.839 --> 06:43.675
The driving school. At that age
they make friends in those places.

06:43.759 --> 06:46.435
In yoga classes, pottery classes,
at the driving school.

06:46.519 --> 06:48.399
The driving school is a bummer.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.156
They're all kids,
they're like my students.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.956
- There are teachers. Your teacher?
- My teacher is crazy.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.596
He's unbearable, he talks
constantly with set phrases.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.355
For example?

06:59.439 --> 07:03.795
For example, he says "nervouth"
instead of "nervous", I swear.

07:03.879 --> 07:04.879
Nervouth.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.280
"Easy and for the whole family".

07:07.879 --> 07:10.076
- "Step on the cockroach".
- The cockroach?

07:10.160 --> 07:11.795
He must be good at least.

07:11.879 --> 07:14.755
He can't be that good
because I drive like shit.

07:14.839 --> 07:17.800
It's the clutch, it gets me down.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.916
That's the cockroach: the clutch.
He calls it the cockroach.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.240
- Why?
- Because you have to step on it.

07:26.759 --> 07:29.836
Any idiot with a high school diploma

07:29.920 --> 07:31.795
can learn to drive in a week.

07:31.879 --> 07:34.396
And you, with a doctorate in
Medieval Literature, can't.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.600
It's a matter of millimeters,
millimeters.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.995
I think it's easier to drive well
if you're an idiot.

07:42.079 --> 07:43.600
I really think that.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.399
Maybe a little humility helps too.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.276
I think I'm going to
leave the driving school.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.235
And your father's car?

07:52.319 --> 07:54.369
I don't like driving. I'm not good at it.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.079
But you'll start it up
now and then, right?

07:57.560 --> 08:00.360
Otherwise the battery dies
and you're left without a car.

08:02.279 --> 08:04.636
Remember a show we saw on TV years ago,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.120
a car show?

08:09.639 --> 08:12.195
It totally traumatized me.

08:12.279 --> 08:14.229
They showed a car crashing into a rock.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.995
They showed it from different angles,

08:17.079 --> 08:19.720
again and again, again and again, no?

08:24.759 --> 08:25.759
No.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.396
But you didn't get your license
as a young man

08:29.480 --> 08:32.730
because you thought you wouldn't
need it, not because of a trauma.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.759
You thought you'd be rich,
famous and have a driver.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.670
I'm not rich and famous,
but I do have a driver.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.240
- Who?
- You.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.720
That perk is on its way out.

08:48.159 --> 08:49.440
Don't steal my food!

09:24.039 --> 09:25.120
What's wrong?

09:31.240 --> 09:33.039
Alright, try it now.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.120
It was the battery.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.890
Of course it was the battery.

09:39.519 --> 09:43.116
- Thanks a lot, that's it, Ramón.
- No, it's not.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.195
When are you thinking of
getting your driver's license?

09:46.279 --> 09:48.675
- I'm working on it.
- You'd better pass soon.

09:48.759 --> 09:51.516
A car this old,
if you don't drive it, it dies.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.919
Cars are for driving,
not for keeping in a garage.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.595
Why not sell it and forget about it?

09:57.679 --> 09:59.329
Let it be someone else's problem.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.960
Thanks for the battery, Ramón.

10:16.879 --> 10:17.799
Lopetegui!

10:18.320 --> 10:20.356
Lopetegui!

10:20.440 --> 10:21.720
Lopetegui!

10:22.519 --> 10:24.919
We're meeting up today
after class. You coming?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.315
No. I don't know.

10:30.399 --> 10:33.156
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.159
- Ciao, Manuela.
- See you later.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.120
It's not what it looks like.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.440
I don't meet up with
my students after class.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.850
And besides, it wouldn't be
to party, it's something else.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.595
Yoli's in my class, she's nice.

10:47.679 --> 10:50.835
Yes, nice, and I call her
Yolanda, not Yoli.

10:50.919 --> 10:53.236
I don't have that kind of familiarity.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.420
What do you teach her?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.679
I teach her 15th Century Literature. You?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.360
Grammar.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.120
I teach her Grammar.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.720
Sorry, I don't know all
the professors in the faculty.

11:10.919 --> 11:14.475
- Have you not been teaching long?
- No, 15 years.

11:14.559 --> 11:16.600
But I'm not very sociable.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.320
This is disgusting.

11:20.799 --> 11:23.636
Don't you get the impression
that Yolanda speaks strangely?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.600
Strangely? How?

11:26.600 --> 11:29.279
She uses very obscure words.

11:29.919 --> 11:32.396
Do girls her age talk like that?

11:32.480 --> 11:35.360
I think her father's famous,
maybe it's because of that.

11:36.159 --> 11:38.559
She speaks strangely
because her father's famous?

11:39.879 --> 11:42.276
You have a class full of girls her age.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.080
How do the others speak?

11:44.519 --> 11:46.799
I don't know,
I never let them speak in class.

11:48.159 --> 11:49.559
And if they have a question?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.700
I don't like them interrupting me.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.279
Bye.

12:27.679 --> 12:31.080
- Lopetegui, you came!
- What's up, Lopetegui?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.559
Is what you're doing legal?

12:35.720 --> 12:39.600
C'mon, didn't your father take you
to a carpark as a kid to drive?

12:44.279 --> 12:46.075
I have a very specific question.

12:46.159 --> 12:49.759
Then I'll let you go on with
your "2 Fast, 2 Furious" thing.

12:51.279 --> 12:53.835
How can I get a car
to not stall on a hill?

12:53.919 --> 12:56.036
Okay, that's easy.
You put the clutch half down

12:56.120 --> 12:58.315
and when you hear that it wants to move,

12:58.399 --> 13:00.036
you play with it until you notice...

13:00.120 --> 13:02.170
Lorenzo told me that and it doesn't work.

13:03.159 --> 13:05.000
You want a trick.

13:07.919 --> 13:09.399
Put on the handbrake.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.156
Lopetegui, it's a trick.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.480
In tricks, you have to do strange things.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.759
Don't do it with Lorenzo
or he'll get a syncope.

13:25.279 --> 13:27.396
Who taught you to speak like that?

13:27.480 --> 13:30.330
- Your father the famous guy?
- You know who my father is?

13:31.440 --> 13:33.555
I don't know who he is,
only that he's famous.

13:33.639 --> 13:36.795
- Is he a language academic?
- Focus on this, Lopetegui.

13:36.879 --> 13:39.600
Put it in first... and do the earwig.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.080
The "earwig"?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.276
The earwig, Lopetegui, the earwig.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.440
You lift the clutch, hit the accelerator

13:48.799 --> 13:50.600
and play with that.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.200
And when you notice that
the car wants to go,

13:54.120 --> 13:55.519
you take off the handbrake.

14:05.759 --> 14:08.960
Watch the accelerator,
don't shoot off like a missile.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.380
- This is ready to go, right?
- I take off the handbrake...

14:21.320 --> 14:24.356
- That's it.
- You've got it, Lopetegui!

14:24.440 --> 14:26.279
"Easy and for the whole family".

14:32.000 --> 14:33.900
Hello, Elisa. How are you? It's Pablo.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
Does Lorenzo have an hour free tomorrow?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.039
Okay, put me down.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.156
I don't know if I told you

14:49.240 --> 14:52.276
that I don't consider myself
a simple driving school instructor.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.396
Right, you're an educator.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.519
That's right.

14:56.559 --> 14:58.600
I'm an educator, that's right.

14:58.919 --> 15:00.996
I do my utmost for my students.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.516
I've even had sleepless nights
if my student doesn't pass the test,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.120
I put myself in their place.

15:06.559 --> 15:09.156
If only there was a word
to describe that.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.475
Putting yourself in someone's place,
feeling what they feel.

15:11.559 --> 15:13.159
If only there was, but no.

15:15.679 --> 15:16.600
Empathy.

15:17.679 --> 15:18.600
Eh?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.840
Empathy. The word is "empathy".

15:24.320 --> 15:27.480
You sure can tell you're
an educator like me, professor.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.315
I was so happy when Elisa
told me you were coming back.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.715
We thought you were going to
throw in the towel,

15:35.799 --> 15:37.279
but no, here you are.

15:38.759 --> 15:40.595
That's why today we're not
going to force the gadgetry.

15:40.679 --> 15:44.396
Today we're having
a quiet class, no surprises.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.720
- Flat.
- No, no, no.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.399
I want to do the hill.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.410
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, I want to do the hill.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.200
You're bold today, eh, professor?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.320
I like it.

15:57.759 --> 16:01.516
Start her up, step on that cockroach,

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
and let's go.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.955
Careful, careful. Stop.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.960
Brake, brake. Watch the lady.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.039
Right. The time has come. Now relax.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.715
I am relaxed.

16:15.799 --> 16:17.916
If you're relaxed,
I'm right to say "relax",

16:18.000 --> 16:20.636
or you get "nervouth". Right, go.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.360
Find the vibrato for me.
The key is the vibr...

16:28.600 --> 16:29.550
What are you doing?

16:29.960 --> 16:31.840
What are you doing?

16:33.759 --> 16:34.679
What...?

16:36.559 --> 16:40.195
Have some self-respect
and take that handbrake off now.

16:40.279 --> 16:42.475
No! Please! Please!

16:42.559 --> 16:45.080
No, professor, not you.
Don't do this to me.

16:45.399 --> 16:46.879
Not you, not you.

16:47.399 --> 16:49.516
The handbrake trick.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.799
The handbrake...

16:51.679 --> 16:53.555
You're blocking the road.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.955
My God, what a shame!

16:56.039 --> 16:58.675
What a shame! A terrible shame!

16:58.759 --> 16:59.840
What's wrong?

17:01.919 --> 17:03.276
Did the handbrake break?

17:03.360 --> 17:06.156
No, it didn't break, he broke it.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.796
He tried the hill start trick
and now it's all gone sour.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.475
You didn't you do the earwag?

17:12.559 --> 17:14.876
Of course I did,
and it's "earwig", not "earwag".

17:14.960 --> 17:15.955
No, Pablo, please.

17:16.039 --> 17:18.195
Don't you dare correct this lady,

17:18.279 --> 17:22.556
you're a big professor, but now
you don't give lessons to anyone.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.156
- So you can't move.
- The car's dead!

17:25.240 --> 17:29.156
How can we? What's worse,
something else is dead.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.839
Our empathy.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.390
Don't worry, we're not moving
from here without a tow truck.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.275
You're bringing it, aren't you?
I hope so.

17:41.359 --> 17:43.519
Don't forget, you crook.

17:45.039 --> 17:46.279
Well, see you later.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.359
You know who Yoli is?

17:59.359 --> 18:02.475
She's a student of yours at college,
I teach her too.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.675
Yes, I know who she is.

18:03.759 --> 18:07.799
Yoli has several theories about
why you're getting your license.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.675
You're having a child,
you're moving to the outskirts,

18:11.759 --> 18:14.119
the typical reasons one gets
the license so old.

18:14.519 --> 18:15.636
I tell her that

18:15.720 --> 18:19.116
you don't a reason to get
a driver's license.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.396
Do you spend the whole class
talking about me, or what?

18:21.480 --> 18:25.195
We have time for everything,
to learn how to park, talk about you,

18:25.279 --> 18:27.960
to not put the handbrake on
for a hill start...

18:31.279 --> 18:33.680
She also told me you wrote a novel.

18:35.359 --> 18:37.409
I told her it wasn't mine,
but it is mine.

18:38.759 --> 18:40.160
I wrote it many years ago.

18:40.799 --> 18:43.519
What, are you embarrassed?
Was it that bad?

18:55.799 --> 18:58.349
The publishers said it was
going to be a bestseller,

18:59.079 --> 19:01.720
and not a normal bestseller,
one of those that...

19:03.200 --> 19:06.035
sells lots of copies
wins prizes, gains prestige...

19:06.119 --> 19:09.200
- Like "Homeland".
- Yes, like "Homeland".

19:09.839 --> 19:12.400
But without ETA, I guess.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.160
- No, sure, ETA's not in it.
- You see?

19:17.640 --> 19:21.590
They were going splurge on publicity,
we were going to kill it at the Book Fair,

19:21.680 --> 19:23.799
then "The Sixth Sense" came out.

19:24.599 --> 19:25.519
And?

19:28.599 --> 19:32.275
In my novel, the twist was that
the protagonist didn't know he was dead.

19:32.359 --> 19:34.160
Hey, like Bruce Willis.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.319
That's what everyone said:
"Hey, just like Bruce Willis".

19:40.440 --> 19:41.880
I hadn't seen the film.

19:42.319 --> 19:44.839
I'd spent years working on the novel.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.876
The film came out
two months before my book

19:47.960 --> 19:50.560
and, of course, everyone thought
I'd copied the idea.

19:52.799 --> 19:56.480
Well, I'm sure the novel had
good things apart from that.

19:57.119 --> 19:58.369
It didn't matter anymore.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.680
Not even my family read it.

20:03.559 --> 20:05.880
I went to my dad's house for lunch

20:06.440 --> 20:08.675
and they'd wedged the copy I gave him

20:08.759 --> 20:11.160
under the dining room table.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.960
That fucking "Sixth Sense" kid!

20:17.960 --> 20:21.799
He's really gotten fat,
and he was so cute as a kid...

20:23.160 --> 20:24.720
Now he's all roly-poly.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.960
Yolanda, would you mind
staying for a minute?

20:44.599 --> 20:45.519
Yes.

20:47.759 --> 20:52.279
Look, I'd like you
to get this to your father.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.755
It's my latest book,
I'm publishing it in a few months.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.316
It'd be an honor if
your father wrote the prologue.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.515
I don't know if he'll be able to.

20:59.599 --> 21:02.076
He's very busy, he always is.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.955
I understand, but it'd mean a lot to me.

21:05.039 --> 21:08.316
And Arturo Macías writing
the prologue would help...

21:08.400 --> 21:10.050
the book to sell more, of course.

21:10.319 --> 21:12.556
I'll tell him and see what he says.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.359
I don't need to tell you
that there'd be compensation.

21:16.680 --> 21:20.116
My father does it by choice,
he never charges for things like this.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.359
No, I mean your grade in this subject.

21:27.279 --> 21:28.515
Right.

21:28.599 --> 21:29.519
I'll try.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.556
Thanks a lot, Yolanda.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.559
Ciao.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.119
What the hell is going on?

21:58.440 --> 22:01.116
Pump your brakes, it was just bad luck.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.156
Is this the student or his dad?
How old is he?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.876
Talk to me, Mariano, talk to me.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.435
There's nothing to talk about.

22:07.519 --> 22:11.076
He pays to fix the car
and he's expelled from the school.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.475
The usual in these cases.

22:12.559 --> 22:13.599
It wasn't him,

22:14.319 --> 22:15.400
It was me.

22:15.799 --> 22:18.076
What? Lorenzo, don't shit me.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.035
You did the trick? I don't believe it.

22:21.119 --> 22:24.556
I did the trick to show him
that you never should do it.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.200
Lorenzo, I tell you this with
all the affection in the world.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.356
This "educator" thing
is getting out of hand.

22:31.440 --> 22:36.035
Teach normally, with your
usual blather, but normally.

22:36.119 --> 22:37.200
Got it?

22:38.319 --> 22:40.755
- Don't you have a class now?
- Yes.

22:40.839 --> 22:43.275
Then take my car
and go to the driving school.

22:43.359 --> 22:45.519
To top it off you'll make me lose money.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.359
You drive.

22:52.039 --> 22:53.440
Get in the car.

22:55.279 --> 22:57.240
Put the belt on and start her up.

22:58.759 --> 22:59.755
Let's go.

22:59.839 --> 23:03.435
But this isn't a practice car.
You can't help with the pedals.

23:03.519 --> 23:07.356
If you don't go up this hill alone,
I'm not a teacher, an educator, nothing.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.916
Shit is what I am.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.275
So get up this hill
without the car stalling.

23:12.359 --> 23:13.435
- Lorenzo...
- Let's go.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.000
Turn the truck around. Shit!
The other way...

23:17.640 --> 23:20.240
Vibrato, vibrato, up... Go, foot down.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.400
Foot down. You can do it.
That's it, that's it.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.796
Holy shit! Easy and for the whole family.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.279
He can't drive my car! Fucking hell!

23:36.480 --> 23:37.599
Hey, Lorenzo.

23:38.519 --> 23:40.819
Do you remember a program
on TV many years ago?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.836
One about cars which was all accidents.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.596
- The Second Chance.
- That's it!

23:46.680 --> 23:48.076
But it wasn't about accidents.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.720
It was about teaching people
to drive safely.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.450
I became and educator
because of that program.

24:02.079 --> 24:03.519
THE SECOND CHANCE

24:09.160 --> 24:12.475
José María was given today

24:12.559 --> 24:16.195
a heap of a car,
you drive without your hands.

24:16.279 --> 24:19.316
It has little lights and cosmic sounds

24:19.400 --> 24:22.680
and a robotic voice,
like it came from Badajoz.

24:23.519 --> 24:25.195
José María, lad,

24:25.279 --> 24:27.039
I'm the car you're talking about.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.596
My name is KITT.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.076
KITT, the amazing car.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.156
I was designed and souped up
especially for you

24:34.240 --> 24:36.796
in Calzadilla de los Barros,
the province of Badajoz.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.955
But my Josema is in love,

24:40.039 --> 24:43.160
in love with cars from the past.

24:43.559 --> 24:46.755
But her Josema is in love,

24:46.839 --> 24:50.039
in love with cars from the past.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.240
José María has christened the car,

25:00.640 --> 25:03.876
a short, simple name to his liking.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.960
José María called the car KITT, and in...
