WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.637
Previously on Scorpion...
Last night was worth

00:03.671 --> 00:06.040
waiting three years for, huh?

00:07.175 --> 00:09.377
Patel's out,
and you're in.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.345
The alderman seat's yours,

00:11.379 --> 00:12.613
if you want it.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.448
If I uncuff him
without a direct order,

00:14.482 --> 00:17.718
I violate a half a dozen
federal statutes.

00:17.751 --> 00:18.752
Collins!

00:18.786 --> 00:20.354
(laughing)

00:21.789 --> 00:25.259
Agent Gallo, you're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.627
I want a lawyer.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.629
Gonna need one.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.065
SYLVESTER:
Fellow aldermen,

00:31.099 --> 00:33.201
I hold in my hand
an impassioned plea

00:33.234 --> 00:35.503
to restore the after-school
science club

00:35.536 --> 00:37.105
to Madison Elementary,

00:37.138 --> 00:38.806
which was cut
due to lack of space.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.209
It is my understanding
that the library basement

00:41.242 --> 00:42.310
is now available.

00:42.343 --> 00:46.114
I submit it be allocated for use
by the science club

00:46.147 --> 00:48.549
so that young minds
may flourish.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.820
So, what do you think
of the opening?

00:52.853 --> 00:55.389
SUPER FUN GUY STATUE:
My Whoopee Cushion of Doom

00:55.423 --> 00:57.191
will blast you to atoms!

00:57.225 --> 00:58.292
(whoopee cushion noise)

00:58.326 --> 00:59.693
PATTY: Better review
than I'd give you.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.794
Oh. I know you.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.130
You're the reporter

01:02.163 --> 01:04.498
from the West Altadenia Shopper.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.734
Patty Logan,
here to get your autograph?

01:06.767 --> 01:09.837
Really? My political career
has just barely taken flight,

01:09.870 --> 01:13.307
but already... a signature
worth getting.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.643
On this internship release form.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.246
My school has a deal with
West Altadenia city hall.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.347
They provide internships
with aldermen,

01:19.380 --> 01:22.516
our civics department
provides them with good PR.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.385
Seems I pulled the short straw.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.886
Short straw?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.355
You endorsed me.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.123
And you still lost the election.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.758
If Patel hadn't been caught
taking a bribe,

01:30.791 --> 01:32.293
you wouldn't be in office.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.527
You're a rookie politician.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.129
I can't waste my internship

01:35.163 --> 01:36.897
on someone who knows
less about the town than I do.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.599
What do you know? You're 14.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.535
15. And I know you're not
saving the science club

01:41.569 --> 01:43.904
with that turd of a speech.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.141
The library basement is the
hottest 500 square feet in town.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.709
Old folks club wants it
for Strummin' Seniors.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.311
Rotary club has their eye on it.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.580
And Rage-a-holics wants
to hold meetings there,

01:52.613 --> 01:54.582
and you don't want
to piss them off.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.684
Sly, if I may.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.186
I heard your speech
from the kitchen,

01:58.219 --> 02:00.288
I think it was logical
and reasoned.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.690
Thank you, Walter.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.558
Don't encourage him,
because his science club

02:04.592 --> 02:05.826
is toast without cookies.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.695
Oh, reminds me: my toast.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.463
I've been covering West
Altadenia for the Shopper

02:09.497 --> 02:10.698
since sixth grade.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.501
A pothole doesn't get patched
without me knowing about it.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.935
And what I know is,

02:14.968 --> 02:17.171
if you give a simple batch
of shortbread crisps

02:17.205 --> 02:19.340
to the right person,
you get your basement.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.375
Go on.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.876
Not until you sign
the release form.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.912
Let me work for
someone else.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.449
No.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.717
I won't be blackmailed.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.452
Fine.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.588
Then I'll ask my civics teacher
to change my assignment.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.657
I was hoping we could
avoid unpleasantries.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.259
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:38.292 --> 02:41.762
I've never gotten a tardy
and I'm not starting today.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.298
Fine. Get a new alderman.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.599
See if it bothers me.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.201
I was rejected by
high school girls

02:47.235 --> 02:48.636
all the time at your age.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.937
I am used to it.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.874
That's telling her.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.709
(door opens)

02:55.743 --> 02:56.877
Allie.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.613
Are-are you okay?

02:59.647 --> 03:02.483
I've tried calling you for about
20 minutes, it's been busy.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.219
Sorry, I've been running tests
on my new robocalling system.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
It's part of my alderman
responsibilities.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.955
Have you heard from Cabe?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.223
No, I haven't seen him
since last night.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.291
He was gonna see you.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.659
He didn't make it.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.227
He called and told me

03:13.261 --> 03:14.895
that he'd been arrested
by the FBI.

03:14.928 --> 03:15.896
Arrested?

03:15.929 --> 03:17.030
For what?
He wouldn't say.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.932
He said it was a mistake
and that he'd take care of it

03:18.966 --> 03:20.968
and be back by morning,
but he never showed.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.570
W-Why didn't anyone call us?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.272
ALLIE: He didn't want
to worry you guys,

03:24.305 --> 03:25.806
but I didn't know
who else to go to.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.741
You did the right thing. Where is he?
Federal courthouse.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.477
WALTER:
Okay.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.778
(door opens)

03:33.381 --> 03:35.583
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

03:38.018 --> 03:41.255
Aiding and abetting
the escape of an inmate?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.490
That's how you got arrested?

03:42.523 --> 03:43.757
What the hell
are you doing here?

03:43.791 --> 03:44.925
Bailing you out.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.360
I'm gonna explain
to the authorities

03:46.394 --> 03:48.296
that you had to remove
Collins's ankle cuff.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.530
Won't make a difference.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.931
Carson, the new
Homeland director,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.600
he's clearly got it out for me.

03:52.633 --> 03:56.036
We were stopping a
cataclysmic extinction event.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.473
Me uncuffing Collins,
after Homeland approved

03:59.507 --> 04:02.276
his prison furlough,
made Carson look bad.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.811
Now he's gonna
have me take the fall.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.314
Bottom dollar, Carson
pulled strings to make sure

04:06.347 --> 04:08.416
my public defender
is a fourth grader.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.551
JOSH: Actually,
I'm 24.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.320
I'll be 25 in October.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.622
You're his lawyer?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.989
Josh Mitchell, Esq.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.625
Cabe,

04:17.658 --> 04:18.826
I'm gonna talk
to the prosecutor,

04:18.859 --> 04:20.561
and figure out our next steps.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.929
Shouldn't you already
know the steps?

04:21.962 --> 04:22.930
When did you pass the bar?

04:22.963 --> 04:25.065
A week ago, Tuesday.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.401
That's great. Fantastic.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.304
A prepubescent public defender?

04:30.338 --> 04:32.873
Let's get you
a top flight advocate.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.476
Been on a lawman's salary
for 40 years.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.446
What I got saved up won't even
cover a decent retainer.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.847
Never mind
my representation.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.982
You mind telling me
how you guys came up with

04:42.015 --> 04:43.651
a half mil bail?

04:43.684 --> 04:46.019
I dove into some savings.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.721
HAPPY: I promised some online
wrenchers vintage bike parts

04:47.755 --> 04:49.423
at good prices.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.025
Same here, except comics
instead of motorcycle stuff.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.327
TOBY: You know those
blank checks you get

04:53.361 --> 04:54.094
with your credit card bills?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.729
So a loan for 19%?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.297
19.5.

04:58.766 --> 05:02.636
Mortgage. On the business.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.804
You put Scorpion
up as collateral?

05:03.837 --> 05:04.738
The garage, everything?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.874
It was either that or
leave you in prison.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.676
It was jail, not prison!

05:08.709 --> 05:09.843
I can handle myself.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.011
TOBY: You know,
Cabe, you have

05:11.044 --> 05:12.813
a very weird way
of saying thank you.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.882
Listen to me next time,
and then I'll thank you.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.617
Don't argue with them,
it was my fault.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.819
Stop it right there. You
hesitated to release Collins.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.454
You knew it was
breaking the law.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.823
I was the one who yelled at
you to hurry up and do it.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.492
When was the last time
anybody convinced me

05:24.525 --> 05:25.759
to do something
I didn't want to do?

05:25.793 --> 05:26.960
TOBY:
Yesterday.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.362
When Walter got you
to uncuff Collins.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.463
Weren't you just listening?

05:29.497 --> 05:30.598
Ow.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.865
I take full responsibility.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.501
The buck stops here.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.568
Is that why you told Allie

05:34.602 --> 05:35.836
not to call us?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.770
Machismo nonsense?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.906
I didn't want
to be a burden, now I am.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.073
Family's not a burden.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.174
What's a burden crippling debt,

05:41.208 --> 05:43.977
so I took on a case
while you were bailing Cabe out.

05:44.011 --> 05:44.978
Without discussing it first?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.980
Could be a year
till we get Cabe's trial date,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.682
and we're waiting
to hear from his lawyer,

05:48.716 --> 05:49.883
so in the meantime, while
we're trying to keep

05:49.917 --> 05:51.151
Scorpion above water,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.120
we need to bail ourselves out
of a half a million dollar debt.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.389
Unbelievable.
The client is

05:55.423 --> 05:56.657
Wildlife Animal Guardians.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.492
It's a charity, so
it won't pay top dollar,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.027
but since we're currently
at our bottom dollar,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.662
I suggest we get to work.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.797
(sighs)

06:03.831 --> 06:05.799
ADISSA: A poached
rhino horn.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.502
We intercepted a case
on the black market.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.938
Problem is, we have no
idea where it came from.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.641
Could be Africa,
Malaysia, India.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.043
People are still killing these
animals for their horns, huh?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.145
TOBY: They're ground up, and
then they're sold in vials

06:18.178 --> 06:19.079
worth a fortune in Asia

06:19.112 --> 06:22.516
for their purported
medicinal benefits.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.052
They think it gives a little
goose to the old gooty.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.755
A $213 billion industry

06:27.788 --> 06:29.790
destroying wildlife worldwide.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.925
CABE: Often funding
other operations.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.027
Human trafficking,
drugs, terrorism.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.430
Correct. I called Scorpion

06:36.464 --> 06:38.932
because I read about the DNA
sequencer you'd developed.

06:38.966 --> 06:39.967
SYLVESTER:
Yes.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.570
We've used it on spies in Cuba.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.971
And monkey poop.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.640
The number of horns
we intercepted indicates

06:46.674 --> 06:48.809
that they are ramping
up their operation.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.945
They could wipe out thousands of
rhinos at the end of the month

06:51.979 --> 06:53.981
if we don't act fast.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.650
My hope is you could sample
the horns we intercepted

06:56.684 --> 06:58.819
and identify
the subspecies of rhino.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.754
With that information,
we should be able narrow down

07:00.788 --> 07:02.823
the geographic region
the horns came from.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.492
PAIGE: And if you can figure
out where they came from,

07:04.525 --> 07:05.626
you can notify the
proper authorities

07:05.659 --> 07:06.727
and nail the poachers.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.895
Piece of cake.
Adissa,

07:07.928 --> 07:10.731
does your organization work
closely with law enforcement?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.800
Yes. But we've only
been able to arrest

07:12.833 --> 07:14.468
low-level foot soldiers.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.936
That just disrupts
business a day or two.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.171
You could go after
wealthy buyers,

07:18.205 --> 07:21.174
but basic economic theory
dictates

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
that you'll always
have someone to take their place

07:22.643 --> 07:23.644
if demand is high.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.146
CABE: Best way to nail
an organized crime unit

07:26.179 --> 07:27.214
is to cut out the middleman.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.649
Eliminate distribution,

07:28.682 --> 07:31.184
the organization is left
topless and bottomless.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.622
Like certain clubs
near the airport.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.689
Got the results.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.591
That quickly?

07:37.625 --> 07:38.892
That's impossible.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.762
Nope. I ran the sequence
on an online database.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.632
The horn came
from a crash of rhinos

07:44.665 --> 07:45.966
in a region of five valleys

07:45.999 --> 07:47.768
in the nation of Bozatta.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.236
Still a pretty
big swath of land.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.804
Well, we can narrow it down.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.773
All we do is match
the DNA in the horn

07:52.806 --> 07:54.542
to DNA samples on the ground.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.176
Oh, no, more poop?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.911
Well, rhino dung is full of DNA.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.013
And parasites, and bacteria.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.982
We get a match on dung
in a specific valley,

08:02.015 --> 08:03.617
we'll know that's where
the poachers are working out of.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.118
ADISSA: Then the
authorities move in.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.187
This is exactly
the help we need.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.057
I'll make arrangements
to fly you all out immediately.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.925
Okay, team, let's get packing.

08:11.959 --> 08:15.996
Um, I had to surrender my
passport as a condition of bail.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.130
I can't come.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.265
Oh, okay.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.933
Well, you can QB
from the garage.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.702
Maybe you can watch
over Ralph this weekend

08:21.735 --> 08:23.637
after he gets dropped off
from school? Paige,

08:23.671 --> 08:24.938
that work for you?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.073
Absolutely.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.174
Great.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.942
Relegated to babysitter.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.663
Look at this terrain.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.265
I am hoping to see a
West African common loon.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.035
I'm looking at a West Altadenia
common loon right now.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.809
This is one of several compounds
around the world

09:01.842 --> 09:04.111
to rehab and protect
endangered animals.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.246
Don't be alarmed
by the firepower.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.181
It's protection
from poachers.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.651
Well, the magazine capacity
and firing speed

09:10.684 --> 09:12.953
would surely put a hitch
in the giddyup of any bad guys.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.221
(quietly):
"Hitch in the giddyup"?

09:14.254 --> 09:15.689
I thought we left Cabe at home.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.957
ADISSA:
Don't be alarmed.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
I'm very well-trained

09:18.826 --> 09:21.061
and will have my rifle
on the plains.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.563
Come. Let me show you
our medical facilities.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.871
Thank you, officer.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.343
Top veterinarians volunteer
their services.

09:36.376 --> 09:40.748
These incubators house rare
peacock eggs to maturity.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.616
And this is Solomon Ebke.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.285
A retired general
of our nation's military.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.287
He runs security
for the compound.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.089
Solomon, this is Team Scorpion.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
We can't thank you enough.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.825
Poachers are a threat
to many animals

09:51.859 --> 09:53.627
on the endangered
species list.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.896
Your help is paramount
to our success.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.164
Well, when we're done here,

09:57.197 --> 10:00.300
the poachers will be the ones
on the endangered species list.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.736
Which one are you,
Cagney or Lacey?

10:02.770 --> 10:06.774
Okay, I think it's time we break
into groups and go dung diving.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.908
Hey, hey.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.376
Um, after we're done
with this case,

10:09.409 --> 10:11.044
how about you and I
change our tickets

10:11.078 --> 10:12.179
and stay a few extra days?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.047
See the plains of Africa.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.149
If I've learned anything
from '80s supergroup Toto,

10:16.183 --> 10:17.350
they're spectacular.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.819
It's a free honeymoon.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.888
What could be more romantic?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.322
(flies buzzing)

10:24.057 --> 10:25.659
I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.294
I've been taking stool samples
for four hours.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.929
Do you want to switch jobs?
No.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.063
Please, just run the test.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.969
Okay, Walt, about to get
the scoop on some poop.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.771
Yeah, okay,
keep me apprised.

10:37.805 --> 10:38.906
Oh, over here.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.908
Tracks.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.412
(sniffs) Mm.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.780
Animals were just here.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.848
Dung can't be far away.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.850
You mean like that giant
pile of crap right there?

10:49.883 --> 10:52.953
(flies buzzing)

10:52.986 --> 10:55.055
I'll get samples.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.057
He seems to be taking
to the safari life.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.693
TOBY: I got a theory
on what's going on

10:59.727 --> 11:00.928
with our
dung-smelling Magellan.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.995
Care to share?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.396
Not yet.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.698
I want to watch this monkey

11:04.732 --> 11:07.100
in his unnatural
habitat a bit longer.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.969
Hang on. Sly,
say that again.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.238
All right, Walt.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.706
Drop the droppings.
Let's move it.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.874
Sly got a hit.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.410
(quietly):
Ooh. Nice.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.313
CABE:
Hey.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.315
Look who finally woke up.
How'd you sleep?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.918
(sighs)
Camper still smells like Ray.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.053
How'd the couch treat you?

11:26.086 --> 11:27.487
It didn't.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.423
Was up all night
working with the team.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.092
That's a lie.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.861
They were flying
all night.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.096
You didn't get any sleep
because you're upset

11:36.129 --> 11:37.264
that they bailed you out.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.733
They shouldn't
have gotten involved.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.936
Scorpion is too important
to risk for one man.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.973
Isn't it the Marines who say,
"No man left behind"?

11:46.006 --> 11:49.076
Shut up and eat your eggs.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.112
(sighs)

11:53.480 --> 11:55.015
Hello, gang.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.149
Any progress?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.018
Yeah, several
smelly pounds of it.

11:58.051 --> 11:58.952
We got a match.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.454
The poached rhinos
came from this valley.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.957
Which means the poachers
aren't far from here.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.158
We just need to alert...

12:05.192 --> 12:06.159
(gunshot)

12:06.193 --> 12:07.094
Whoa, poachers might be closer
than you realized.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.162
Africa has been nice,
but we got to go.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.431
Happy, follow us!

12:11.464 --> 12:13.433
We're Oscar Mike!

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
SYLVESTER:
Oscar Mike?!

12:15.368 --> 12:17.771
Why are we following him
towards the gunfire?!

12:17.805 --> 12:19.907
Sunglasses don't mean he's Cabe!

12:19.940 --> 12:22.242
CABE: Walter, do not go
towards the gunshots.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.544
Hello?

12:24.577 --> 12:28.248
When the hell did everybody
stop listening to me?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.486
WALTER:
There. He has a gun.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.995
(gunshot)

12:42.029 --> 12:44.264
ADISSA:
Hey!

12:44.297 --> 12:45.999
Let's go.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.814
(animal mewling)

13:00.848 --> 13:03.316
He shot this poor deer.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.520
It's a spotted munt deer.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.356
Only about five left
in the world.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.358
Hunted to the brink
of extinction

13:11.391 --> 13:12.459
because its organs are
wrongfully believed

13:12.492 --> 13:13.460
to cure cancer.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.195
This animal alone

13:15.228 --> 13:17.164
could be worth half a million
on the black market.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.431
That means he won't
leave it behind.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.933
He's going for reinforcements.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.168
It's suffering.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.235
It's a through-and-through
abdominal.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.137
Sutures can stabilize her,
but if we don't get her

13:24.171 --> 13:25.138
to the animal sanctuary,
she won't survive.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.573
Well, let's throw her
in the back of the Jeep.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.908
SYLVESTER:
Hey.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.409
I get that there's
only four of them,

13:29.442 --> 13:32.179
but there's only one Sylvester
Dodd, and I'm an animal, too,

13:32.212 --> 13:35.015
and I'd really like
to preserve me.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.416
Cabe said dudes with guns
are coming back

13:36.449 --> 13:37.450
to collect this critter.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.386
Critters, plural.
She's pregnant.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.221
What? TOBY: Uterus is punctured

13:41.254 --> 13:42.890
and amniotic
fluid is leaking.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.491
This womb is compromised.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.094
Based on the
crown/rump length,

13:47.127 --> 13:49.596
I'm guessing it's halfway
through its gestation period.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.398
It's way too young
to survive outside the womb.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.499
CABE:
Damn it, get out of there.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.201
I am not there to protect you.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.336
Okay, you guys heard
the angry man in Los Angeles.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.504
Let's skedaddle.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.140
No damn way. You want to let
this mother and baby die?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.374
It's not my preference,

14:01.408 --> 14:03.010
but I'd really like
to let this baby live.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
Paige, I respect
your motherly instincts,

14:05.112 --> 14:06.179
but there's just no way

14:06.213 --> 14:08.281
this fawn can live
without a womb.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.283
It might be insane,
but can we build one?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.584
SYLVESTER:
Not "might be."

14:11.618 --> 14:13.186
It is insane.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.287
Hold on. I've seen you geeks

14:14.321 --> 14:16.423
build a gun with a paper towel
tube and a urinal cake.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.958
You crafted a
submarine escape hatch

14:17.991 --> 14:19.459
from an oil drum,
so if it's possible,

14:19.492 --> 14:20.894
figure out a way

14:20.928 --> 14:22.362
to build this kid a-a womb.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.564
Actually, a kid
is a baby goat.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.599
Toby, you're playing with fire.
WALTER: Paige.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.235
It's impossible.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.469
PAIGE:
Walter.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.638
You ever want to see me naked
again, you figure this out.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.608
You heard her, team.
Let's save these deer.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.644
♪

14:45.618 --> 14:48.088
An artificial womb.
Warmth, protection, oxygen,

14:48.121 --> 14:50.991
everything a mother gives,
minus the crippling guilt.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.094
So, we got to build that first
because baby's weakest.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.262
Then I can triage mama.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.097
Even if we build this perfectly,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.266
odds are high that
mama and baby will die.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.134
ADISSA: Poachers
might be back soon.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.503
I'm giving Solomon
our coordinates.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.371
All right, team.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.941
Time to order up
a little womb service.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.377
My medical bag has sterile
salt water with antibiotics

15:10.410 --> 15:12.112
that will sub in
for the amniotic fluid.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.981
The truck's heat sensor
will help us keep the baby

15:14.014 --> 15:15.248
at 99 degrees,

15:15.282 --> 15:17.350
the exact temperature
of a real deer womb.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.386
A cassava root's cell walls
will act as a placenta,

15:19.419 --> 15:20.520
providing oxygen,

15:20.553 --> 15:23.356
which will reach the baby
via the umbilical cord,

15:23.390 --> 15:25.959
plastic tubing
from the poacher's water bag.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.360
Now all we need
is something soft

15:27.394 --> 15:28.361
to create a wall
for the fake womb.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.463
The windows. We can
melt the edges together

15:30.497 --> 15:32.332
to form a bag.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.101
It will be a while
before Solomon arrives.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.969
I hope the poachers
don't get here first.

15:36.003 --> 15:39.572
Well, I will keep them
at bay if they...

15:39.606 --> 15:40.740
(gunshot)

15:40.773 --> 15:41.975
Was that a gunshot?

15:45.145 --> 15:46.346
It was unintended.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.050
My mistake.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.418
CABE:
Walt, I say this with love,

15:51.451 --> 15:54.087
but you better put that
gun in Adissa's hands

15:54.121 --> 15:57.257
or when I see you I am
gonna put my foot in your...

15:57.290 --> 16:00.027
Copy. HAPPY: There's still enough
plastic here to make a womb,

16:00.060 --> 16:01.394
but only a single layer.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.464
Well, it'll have to work.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.265
Right, Walter?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.466
SYLVESTER:
Guys, I've been searching

16:06.499 --> 16:10.070
the poacher's bag for matches
so we can melt the plastic

16:10.103 --> 16:11.171
and I found some.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.505
Look what else I found.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.041
His sat phone.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.608
That will have
all his contacts in it.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.177
Every scumbag he works with.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.578
You could kill
the whole operation.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.280
Yes, but it's encrypted.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.581
You've got to crack it.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.050
Linking it to you now, Ralph.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.484
RALPH:
Got it.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.260
It's as good as Mother Nature.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.561
Hurry up, Doc, she's in pain.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.029
Okay.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.299
Bedtime for Mommy Deer-est.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.335
Tough crowd.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.439
Won't that hurt her?

16:46.473 --> 16:48.341
It's just gonna make her sleep

16:48.375 --> 16:49.509
so that I can remove the baby.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.281
Hey. Don't worry.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.616
It's gonna be as easy
as A-B-C-section.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.353
No?

17:04.291 --> 17:06.526
Out cold with a strong
pulse. I'm ready.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.827
Okay. I'll assist.
TOBY: Perfect.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.662
Happy, be ready to cut
the umbilical cord

17:09.696 --> 17:11.231
and connect the baby's end
to the plastic tube.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.499
You know how I feel about blood.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.101
Yeah, well, we need the mitts

17:14.134 --> 17:15.568
of someone who's hooked up
a million fuel lines.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.670
Happy, get your ass over here
and do what he says.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.314
Bring enough
hand sanitizer?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.649
We came here to examine dung,

17:29.682 --> 17:31.818
so to answer your question, no.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.256
Short clamp.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.558
A sponge.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.827
Validation.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.529
No other doctor in the world
could do this.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.133
That's just what I need to hear
before removing this little one.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.201
(grunts)

17:48.235 --> 17:51.304
A not-yet-ready-for-prime-time
girl.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.379
Is it working?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.281
Might be a surprise,
but this is my first time

18:01.314 --> 18:05.652
super-gluing an umbilical cord
and plastic tubing.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.687
Got it.
This should hold tight.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.422
Squeamish, yes,

18:09.456 --> 18:11.424
but when the pressure is on,
she's rock solid.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.793
Sly, hand sanitizer now.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.895
How will we know
if it's working?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.765
Blood in the tubing will mean
her heart is beating.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.635
Look at that.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.571
Blood from her body
into the root

18:24.604 --> 18:26.473
and then the oxygenated blood
returns.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.208
Damn good engineering, Doc.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.243
Thanks, darling.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.412
Walt, send this little
girl to her womb.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.252
All right, look,
these are the jokes, folks.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.653
Incredible work, team.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.255
Now hurry up and get the hell
out of there.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.224
We're packing up.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.795
Put this over her.

18:48.828 --> 18:52.165
I got munt deer slobber
all over me.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.900
My dad and I might not
agree on much,

18:53.933 --> 18:56.236
but he sure was right
about Boscoe.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.604
Boscoe?

18:57.637 --> 19:01.508
When I was a boy,
I found a stray mutt.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.642
Boscoe.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.676
He was dirty.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.412
He chewed up the furniture.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.879
He left me presents
in my sneakers.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.648
(clears throat)
So, when Dad finally decided

19:08.681 --> 19:11.251
to give him to another family,
I was thrilled.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.352
That's why I like birds.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.620
They keep their distance.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.624
Getting up close and personal
with an animal? A real hassle.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.526
Animals are my life's work.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.295
Never too late
to switch careers.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.496
TOBY:
Guys, we got a problem.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.298
She's down to 97 degrees.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.799
If she reaches 95,
and at this rate,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.668
she will in a matter
of minutes, she'll die.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.503
We-we have to warm her up.
Car engine?

19:30.537 --> 19:31.804
No, that's too hot.
It's gonna cook her.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.839
Light a fire.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.674
That'll melt the womb.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.344
No, what we needed was
two layers of plastic

19:37.377 --> 19:38.811
to retain the heat,
which we had

19:38.845 --> 19:41.748
until Walter Gallo blasted
the window with a shotgun.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.915
"Walter Gallo"?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.551
What does that mean?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.453
It means your psyche
is having you mimic Cabe

19:46.486 --> 19:48.521
because you blame yourself
for his arrest.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.889
You feel guilty
he's not here,

19:49.922 --> 19:51.424
and now you're
making him be here

19:51.458 --> 19:52.825
and that fawn is gonna die!

19:52.859 --> 19:54.661
That's nonsense.
I'm not channeling Cabe.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear
over your sunglasses.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.567
One more comment and my foot
and your ass are...

20:00.600 --> 20:01.834
Oh, boy.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.935
Exactly.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.237
PAIGE:
Children,

20:04.271 --> 20:05.672
if we're done,
temperature is going up.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.274
SYLVESTER:
Brilliant.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.342
Nature's best source
of soothing warmth,

20:09.376 --> 20:10.510
a mother's bosom.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.245
Well, you're one hot mama.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.646
TOBY: That's a smart fix,
but it's only temporary.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.881
Body heat is only
gonna last for so long.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.384
She's never gonna make the two
hour drive to the compound.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.985
We have to find a more efficient
way to keep the baby warm.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.921
Okay, I'm checking
U.S. satellite maps.

20:21.954 --> 20:26.726
There's a Danish oil exploration
camp about five miles northeast.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.828
They must have
controlled heaters

20:28.861 --> 20:30.430
for the cold days out here.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.864
I can modify one
to warm the womb.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.433
Okay, uh, let's split up.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.269
Now, uh, Sly and Adissa,
take mama deer to the compound.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.439
The rest of us will take
the baby to the Danish camp.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.408
I'll call Solomon and
divert him to the camp.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.943
He'll provide protection on
our way back to the compound.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.413
But you and I
will be transporting

20:46.446 --> 20:47.547
the animal worth a fortune

20:47.580 --> 20:49.582
without protection
from poachers?!

20:49.616 --> 20:50.950
Wonderful!

20:56.789 --> 20:59.626
(deer mewling)

21:01.494 --> 21:03.029
I think she's in distress.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.030
Then comfort her.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.432
Comfort her? How?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.467
(deer continues mewling)

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070
Here. Nuts and seeds.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.506
Eat. You need your strength.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.910
You're eating right out
of my hand.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.448
Just like Boscoe used to do.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.454
(gunshots)

21:27.487 --> 21:28.988
What did I say about animals?!

21:29.021 --> 21:30.390
They are always a hassle!

21:36.963 --> 21:38.498
(gunshots) SYLVESTER: Cabe?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.800
We need help.
Two poachers on ATVs

21:40.833 --> 21:41.901
are after us.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.436
You still have
a weapon, right?

21:43.470 --> 21:46.072
Yes.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.306
Just a second...

21:48.975 --> 21:51.744
Scratch that.
No weapon.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.413
Well, what else do you got
to work with there?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.651
A spare gas can, uh,

21:58.685 --> 22:00.887
ah, some duct tape.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.423
Um, shotgun shells.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.425
And a pocket knife.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.026
All right, well, we can make
an explosive.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.395
That sounds dangerous.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.029
So are the poachers.
Do what he says.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.567
CABE:
Open the cap...

22:14.601 --> 22:16.636
and stick a shell in it.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.806
Then I want you to insert
the knife into the spout

22:19.839 --> 22:21.441
so it's touching the shell.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.577
Then invert the spout
back into the can.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.780
(bullets ricocheting)

22:27.814 --> 22:30.049
CABE: The knife will work
as a firing pin--

22:30.082 --> 22:31.551
it'll create a spark.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.688
They are coming up
behind us.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.063
Sylvester, you all right?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.666
Yeah, we're safe.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.067
For now.
Okay.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.135
Thanks, Cabe.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.637
WALTER:
There's Solomon.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.171
(horn honks)

22:52.204 --> 22:53.773
I took the liberty
of gathering items

22:53.806 --> 22:54.774
you might find useful.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.744
I can modify this
flameless battery-powered

22:57.777 --> 22:59.912
camp stove-- it should
warm the fawn.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.881
SYLVESTER (over radio):
Guys, we have a problem.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.750
(engine sputters, dies)

23:03.783 --> 23:04.551
We're out of gas.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.985
The poachers will call
for backup

23:06.018 --> 23:07.620
and return with
more firepower.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.755
Do you have any more fuel?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.557
I had a whole can of it,

23:10.590 --> 23:12.024
but you made me turn it
into a bomb.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.025
CABE:
Okay, listen up.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.629
You can't run carrying
a 70-pound munt deer.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.931
So it's time to hunker down
and get tactical.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.767
Tactical. Yes.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.169
How do I do that?

23:23.202 --> 23:25.505
CABE:
During the Revolutionary War,

23:25.538 --> 23:27.039
George Washington was
surrounded and outnumbered,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.942
so his men lit
several campfires.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.211
The British saw that,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.180
and they thought the Bluejackets
were still there

23:34.213 --> 23:37.650
while Washington's troops were
escaping across the East River.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.918
There are no rivers here.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.219
You got to make them think

23:40.252 --> 23:41.654
you're somewhere you're not.

23:41.688 --> 23:42.655
So check your surroundings.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.924
Look around you, Sly.
What do you see? Think.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.126
Nothing but brush.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.231
The western peregrine.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.768
They utilize a unique
defense mechanism,

23:55.802 --> 23:57.970
and we're gonna copy it.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.708
(device beeps)
Perfect 99 degrees.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.643
Hey, Sly,
whatever you're planning,

24:03.676 --> 24:04.944
be careful,
those guys are killers,

24:04.977 --> 24:05.945
be it animal or human.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.680
You be careful, too.

24:07.714 --> 24:08.781
I stripped the insulation
on these prongs.

24:08.815 --> 24:09.749
Touch 'em, and you'll feel 'em

24:09.782 --> 24:11.884
down in your gooty,
and not in a good way.

24:11.918 --> 24:12.952
Okay. Let's get back

24:12.985 --> 24:14.954
to the compound and
reunite her with her mommy.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.823
Dangerous passage. I'll lead.

24:16.856 --> 24:17.824
I'll go with you.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.659
You guys follow and keep
an eye out for poachers.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.898
POACHER:
Tire marks.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.636
Over there.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.013
They can't be far.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.584
We just need to figure out
which direction they went.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.053
There you go.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.989
Look at the dummy nest,
you dummies.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.596
Come on, Jane, eat.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.565
Jane?

24:58.598 --> 24:59.932
Yeah.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.000
Jane Doe.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.606
Don't like that
she won't eat.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.643
Heart rate is over 200.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.079
She's dehydrated
due to blood loss.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.615
She needs medical attention.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.185
Well, we can't move
until the poachers

25:19.218 --> 25:20.853
follow the fake boot prints.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.923
I made them nonobvious
as to not be suspicious,

25:23.956 --> 25:25.592
but come on.
(cell phone vibrating)

25:28.595 --> 25:29.829
Hello?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.664
They won't let me change
my assignment,

25:31.698 --> 25:32.765
so I'm stuck with you.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.033
(whispering):
Patty, not now.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.702
What the hell?

25:35.735 --> 25:37.003
Keep working the
phone encryption.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.705
PATTY: I'm gonna make the
best of the situation.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.872
That means baking
shortbread crisps

25:39.906 --> 25:41.007
whether you like it or not.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.908
CABE:
Excuse me.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.043
Who are you?
I work for Alderman Dodd.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.144
Assume the oven
in your garage works?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.013
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
wait a minute.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.214
Mr. Gallo.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.281
I have great news.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.717
Well, that's good.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.851
After the day I'm having,
I could use some.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.753
Prosecutor is offering
three years.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.022
Three years?!
I know, it's pretty good, right?

25:56.055 --> 25:58.057
I've got the paperwork right here.
But I'm innocent.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.726
PATTY: If you're innocent,
don't sign.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.827
Do you guys have a mixer?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.629
Who's that?
I have no idea.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.031
Oh. So you're
out of jail and okay.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.733
Would've been nice to know.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.768
Allie, I didn't want you
to be worried.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.771
You call and tell me you're
arrested, then radio silence.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.206
I don't know what's going on and
I leave message after me...

26:14.240 --> 26:16.042
Do I look like
I'm not worried?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.376
She looks worried.
Shut up.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.911
Uh, Mr. Gallo,
these kind of conversations

26:18.945 --> 26:20.613
are supposed to be privileged,
I think.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.781
Is there some place we could go?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.015
I'm about to tell you
where you can go.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.717
Three years is a solid offer.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.052
Three years?!

26:26.085 --> 26:27.153
PATTY:
Don't take the deal.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.855
But you should apologize
to that lady.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.923
Who is that?
I have no idea.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.192
The federal sentencing guideline
is seven years.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.862
The sentencing
for an innocent person is zero.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.196
ALLIE: You're talking plea
with your lawyer

26:37.229 --> 26:38.731
and you haven't
even told me.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.299
Don't you think I'd care
that maybe I won't see you

26:40.332 --> 26:41.634
for three years?!

26:41.668 --> 26:44.070
He's not my lawyer.
Uh, yes, I am.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.072
No, you're fired.
Now you're not.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.107
PATTY (chuckles):
Ooh-ooh, roasted.

26:48.140 --> 26:52.278
Fine. I didn't take the bar four
times to be treated like this.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
You know what?
He's got the right idea.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.082
Allie.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.052
You guys are
out of vanilla extract!

27:00.086 --> 27:01.821
Who the hell are you?!

27:01.854 --> 27:03.055
I cracked the sat phone.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.957
It's a network
of connected lines.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.225
If I call all the
numbers in the network,

27:06.258 --> 27:07.994
each phone will ping
off a local cell tower.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.796
I'll be able to track
every poacher's location.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.230
Dialing the network now.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.432
We'll be able to ID
every guy in the network,

27:13.465 --> 27:15.935
the grunts, the buyers
and the middlemen.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.304
(cell phones ringing)

27:20.940 --> 27:22.842
(quietly):
Ralph, your plan is working.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.044
(cell phone ringing)

27:25.077 --> 27:27.714
I can still hear ringing
in my comms.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.982
Yeah, me too.

27:30.016 --> 27:33.920
But it's not coming
from Sly's location.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.788
Oh, Walter!

27:35.822 --> 27:37.456
CABE:
Walt.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.859
If Solomon's phone is ringing,
clear your throat.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.394
(ringing)

27:42.428 --> 27:45.965
I never answer "blocked caller."

27:45.998 --> 27:47.233
(clears throat)

27:47.266 --> 27:49.068
Walter, Solomon
is a poacher!

27:49.101 --> 27:50.169
(cell phone ringing)

27:58.845 --> 28:01.714
(phone ringing)
So, um, who do you think it is?

28:06.285 --> 28:07.787
Is he making a fist?

28:07.820 --> 28:09.121
Not good. TOBY: Walter,

28:09.155 --> 28:10.790
you are not Cabe.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.059
Maybe it's
trouble calling?

28:13.092 --> 28:14.293
Huh?

28:15.928 --> 28:18.064
Why would he punch him?
That isn't his strong suit.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.267
Uh-oh.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.936
(grunting)

28:28.107 --> 28:28.941
(yells)

28:33.212 --> 28:36.482
If it can take down
a munt deer...

28:36.515 --> 28:38.017
"Trouble's calling"?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.319
You could do better?

28:46.158 --> 28:48.094
Prescription?

28:48.127 --> 28:49.461
Bed rest.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.799
That's actually pretty good.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.402
Do I sound like that?

28:58.437 --> 28:59.906
Footprints!

28:59.939 --> 29:01.774
Uh-huh, this way.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.942
Now.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.454
(truck door closes)

29:15.487 --> 29:17.924
(engine starts)
Go!

29:17.957 --> 29:19.491
(gunfire)

29:30.202 --> 29:32.004
What now?

29:34.373 --> 29:36.208
It worked.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.044
Compound, here we come!

29:38.077 --> 29:40.913
Strange for someone who dislikes
animals to throw his body

29:40.947 --> 29:43.349
over a deer to protect it
from bullets.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.952
Just drive.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.129
Get on a dextrose
saline IV stat.

29:57.163 --> 29:57.964
Careful.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.968
SYLVESTER:
Okay, mama's at the compound.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.002
Where's her kid?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.003
We're minutes out.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.337
And a kid is a baby goat,

30:05.371 --> 30:06.438
but we have a fawn.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.606
RALPH (over radio):
Stop!

30:07.639 --> 30:09.108
Oh, come on, Ralph,
it's just wordplay.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.078
No, stop now. There's
a poacher roadblock ahead.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.381
I'm still tracking their phones.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.448
I can see them all gathering.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.517
CABE: Solomon was leading
you guys into an ambush.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.086
I've called
the Defense Department.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.021
They've notified
the Bozattan military.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.991
They're on their way. Okay. So we'll
wait here until they get rounded up.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.392
Negative-- I'm seeing

30:26.425 --> 30:28.861
three to four poachers
closing in from behind.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.529
We can't stay put, we can't
move back, we can't go forward.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.264
Our little girl here's
running out of time.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.400
Cabe, how far is the
compound as the crow flies?

30:34.433 --> 30:37.203
Well, it's a half mile
due east over a hill.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.040
We're making a break for it.
Out there?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.474
With the poachers?
Walt, I don't want

30:42.508 --> 30:43.575
to get mounted
over a fireplace.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.978
The tall grass will shield us
if we stay low. Here.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.915
Hurry. Hurry,
let's move, let's go.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.253
(monitor beeping)

30:57.389 --> 31:00.392
The surgical team is prepping
the OR in "B" wing

31:00.426 --> 31:03.262
so we can clean her wound
and wash it with antibiotics.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.530
Your team did a great job.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.100
(beeping falters briefly)

31:08.134 --> 31:11.137
Is... that
an abnormal heartbeat?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.972
Yes, but she's
dehydrated.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.373
It's standard to have a few.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.308
I'll be back for her
when the OR is ready.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.344
(beeping continues)

31:20.947 --> 31:22.081
Poachers found your Jeep.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.249
They're entering the grass.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.650
Are these too salty?

31:24.683 --> 31:26.618
Kid, could not be a worse time.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.424
Mm, no, it's delicious.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.260
Knew the recipe was wrong.

31:42.168 --> 31:45.404
Ah, this is
an interesting development.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.278
CABE:
Keep as low as you can, guys.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.480
Any lower, I'd be a groundhog.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.282
Or a politician.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.123
SYLVESTER:
Toby,

32:04.156 --> 32:06.025
Jane's abnormal heartbeats
are speeding up

32:06.058 --> 32:08.594
at a common ratio,
geometrically increasing rate.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.329
By my calculations,
in 210 seconds,

32:10.362 --> 32:13.232
she'll have 130
abnormal heartbeats a minute.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.301
Her heart won't be able to
withstand that, where's the vet?

32:15.334 --> 32:19.105
Uh, she's prepping the OR in
the "B" wing, wherever that is.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.206
You don't have time
to look for them.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.473
You have to shock her heart.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.708
Is there a defibrillator nearby?

32:22.741 --> 32:23.775
Yes!

32:23.809 --> 32:26.712
But it looks like
it hasn't been used in a while.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.948
(gun clicks)

32:30.749 --> 32:33.619
Get up, and give me the animal.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.328
I said get up!

32:45.331 --> 32:46.732
Hand over the munt deer.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.768
Now!

32:49.801 --> 32:51.437
(electricity discharging)

32:51.470 --> 32:52.571
Run!

32:52.604 --> 32:54.706
POACHER:
This way!

32:54.740 --> 32:56.042
RALPH:
Run, Mom!

32:56.075 --> 32:57.109
They know where you are!

33:01.213 --> 33:02.481
Are you kidding me?

33:03.549 --> 33:04.716
(steady beep)
No, no, no.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.319
Not yet, I-I don't have
any conductive gel!

33:07.353 --> 33:08.487
(grunts)

33:14.426 --> 33:16.628
Or do I?

33:17.663 --> 33:18.697
Yes.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.134
A water and alcohol mix
will conduct electricity.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.736
Okay.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.406
There we go.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.740
(whirring)

33:28.774 --> 33:31.043
(panting):
All right.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.279
This might sting a little.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.315
No.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.217
Come on.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.519
No. No.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.554
I can't lose you
like I lost Boscoe!

33:43.689 --> 33:44.723
No.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.228
(beeping)

33:49.261 --> 33:50.829
Oh.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.432
(panting)

33:53.465 --> 33:55.101
That's a good girl.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.103
That's my girl.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.274
WALTER:
The wildlife center. Guys!

34:02.308 --> 34:04.310
We're almost there.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.187
Get your heads down!

34:20.626 --> 34:22.361
(bullets ricocheting)

34:31.703 --> 34:33.705
This animal has no heat source,
open up an incubator!

34:33.739 --> 34:35.107
(grunts) Here.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.242
Okay.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.509
(panting)

34:39.845 --> 34:41.113
She's okay.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.648
You need to regulate
this hot box

34:42.681 --> 34:44.150
so she stays
at 99 degrees.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.185
Great job.

34:46.218 --> 34:47.786
She's gonna live.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.522
And I know you didn't do
it just to see me naked,

34:50.556 --> 34:52.158
but you're gonna
get to anyway.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.835
What's taking so long in there?

35:03.869 --> 35:05.437
Jane's going to be fine.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.472
And her baby?

35:06.505 --> 35:07.773
Your friends are with her now.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.208
She's going to make it.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.842
I have more good news.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.345
The Bozatta Army
captured the poachers.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.181
And with the data
your friend decrypted

35:15.214 --> 35:18.250
from the satellite phone, the
entire operation is going down.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.588
Boscoe would be proud.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.902
Got a text from your mom.
They're a few minutes out.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.207
Can't you make anything
other than scrambled eggs?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.941
No. Now eat.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.477
You know, without your
hackin' and crackin' today,

35:45.511 --> 35:49.147
they would have never
taken down those poachers.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.218
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.720
You helped, too.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.223
If you hadn't shown Sly
how to make that explosive,

35:57.256 --> 35:59.625
he and Adissa and the deer
would've been goners.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.493
Feels good
helping the team, right?

36:01.527 --> 36:02.828
Of course.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.963
But you don't like it
when they help you.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.665
I never took you
for a hypocrite.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.600
Now, hold on a second.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.636
The team helped you, and you
need to accept that help

36:10.669 --> 36:12.471
so that they can feel good, too.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.240
You think
you're being selfless

36:14.273 --> 36:17.809
when you're really
being selfish.

36:17.843 --> 36:18.844
(door opens)

36:18.877 --> 36:20.279
Mom!

36:20.312 --> 36:21.813
Ralph. Come here.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.517
Oh. (laughs)

36:25.551 --> 36:26.785
TOBY:
Okay.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.388
I'm starved. Kovelsky's?
Can't afford it.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.957
Well, I've got some
leftover chicken upstairs.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.592
Well, we got
frozen veggies down here.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.694
Potluck soup it is.
Give me another hug.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.430
Want to help me?

36:38.464 --> 36:39.698
Sure.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.404
Uh, waitress, you went all
turbocharged mama bear today

36:45.437 --> 36:47.806
on the savannah. Even
tore me a new one. I liked it.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.708
Yeah, when it comes to
mamas and their babies,

36:49.741 --> 36:50.942
I can get a
little nuts.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.344
It's okay.
There's nothing stronger

36:52.378 --> 36:53.845
than the mother-child bond.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.415
Hello. Just came
to get my cookies.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.783
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.017
Who are you?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.486
Who cares?
There's cookies here?

37:00.519 --> 37:02.454
I'm Patty,
Alderman Dodd's intern.

37:02.488 --> 37:03.855
I'd left extra shortbreads
for your team,

37:03.889 --> 37:05.824
but they were such a hit
I need all of them

37:05.857 --> 37:07.293
to grease the wheels
of the government.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.927
Um, you don't need all of 'em.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.566
Your loss, Doc.
They were scrumptious.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.668
Ralph doesn't like shortbread.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.270
Yeah, but he sure likes her.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.838
Actually, there might
be one thing

37:19.871 --> 37:21.473
stronger than
the mother-child bond.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.911
This is an interesting
development.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.413
That's what I said.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.281
I don't like this one bit.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.451
Alderman.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.453
Patty. Glad you're here.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.021
Can you explain this?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.023
Mr. Dodd, this is Tyson Bales.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.991
Want to let you know
you've got my vote

37:40.025 --> 37:42.694
for the library basement.
Stella Johnson's, too.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.463
Looks like your science club
has a home.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.864
Congrats.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.734
You got this done
with shortbread crisps?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.869
It's simple.
Kim Becker and Kyle Metney

37:50.902 --> 37:52.704
both have dads
learning the banjo,

37:52.738 --> 37:55.006
so their votes were going
to the Strummin' Seniors.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.644
You have to win over Tyson
Bales and Stella Johnson.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.012
And they don't know you.
Probably don't even like you,

38:01.046 --> 38:03.349
since they were friends
with the man you replaced.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.750
But know who they love?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.017
Santa?

38:06.051 --> 38:08.787
Mrs. Pine,
their fifth grade teacher.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.323
She comes to their swearing-in
ceremony every year,

38:11.357 --> 38:12.624
and then they take her

38:12.658 --> 38:14.893
to Sweet Toto's Bakery
for coffee and...

38:14.926 --> 38:16.695
Shortbread crisps.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.930
So you buttered up
Mrs. Pine with the crisps

38:18.964 --> 38:21.633
and she told them
to support the science club.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.801
That's bribery.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.436
That's politics.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.037
Will you listen to me
from now on?

38:26.071 --> 38:27.673
Depends.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.907
Will you be nice?

38:28.940 --> 38:30.676
I'll be nicer.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.678
I'll take it.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.416
You could've left me a cookie.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.750
TOBY:
Gather up, everyone.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.552
Happy and I
are setting up a surprise.

38:40.586 --> 38:43.389
HAPPY: Cabe, can you and Sly
put the couch movie-style?

38:47.125 --> 38:49.094
So... today,

38:49.127 --> 38:52.964
what, uh, Toby said about you
doing Cabe impersonations...

38:52.998 --> 38:55.734
Uh, it was not,
uh, an impersonation.

38:55.767 --> 38:56.935
Live action role-playing?

38:56.968 --> 38:58.069
Your point?
I think you were

38:58.103 --> 38:59.438
having a hard time today

38:59.471 --> 39:00.539
because of what happened to Cabe

39:00.572 --> 39:02.741
and it affected you
in a really, really weird way.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.443
And I want you to
know just because

39:04.476 --> 39:06.545
I'm your girlfriend
now doesn't mean

39:06.578 --> 39:09.615
I can't still do my job.
So when you're having

39:09.648 --> 39:11.717
emotional stuff, like EQ issues,

39:11.750 --> 39:13.852
I'm-I'm here
to help you.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.588
Our relationship
doesn't change that.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.590
Thank you.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.863
There we go.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.598
Almost showtime.

39:26.632 --> 39:29.134
Uh... before you
raise the curtain,

39:29.167 --> 39:30.736
I would like
to say something.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.773
I can fire a crossbow,

39:34.806 --> 39:37.008
dance a decent box step...

39:37.042 --> 39:39.745
make a mean grilled cheese.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.179
Thanks for sharing, Cabe.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.081
I think Grandpa's
starting to slip.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.150
But what I'm not good at

39:45.183 --> 39:47.385
is accepting help.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.022
You put it on the line for me:

39:51.056 --> 39:54.960
prized possessions,
money, Scorpion.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.196
I'm sorry
for not being grateful.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.865
Thank you.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.633
Our pleasure.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.737
Now, if you'll excuse me,

40:05.771 --> 40:08.006
I'll, uh...

40:08.039 --> 40:10.041
I need to apologize to Allie.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.880
(door opens)

40:14.913 --> 40:16.648
Okay.
(door closes)

40:16.682 --> 40:19.017
Well, food's
almost ready.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.487
What's the main attraction?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.421
Bambi.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.458
My munt deer!

40:26.492 --> 40:28.059
It's a live compound feed.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.995
They're gonna let Jane
visit her baby every day

40:30.028 --> 40:31.530
to keep their bond intact.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.799
Nothing's gonna break that bond.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.901
Not even a punk
with cookies.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.168
Huh?

40:37.202 --> 40:40.472
Nothing.
Just watch the deer, dear.
