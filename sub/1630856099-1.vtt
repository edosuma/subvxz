01:10.820 --> 01:14.365

01:14.449 --> 01:16.200

01:16.284 --> 01:19.537
<i>by French naval explorer
Jean Pierre Le Roche.</i>

01:19.621 --> 01:24.417
<i>He fled to America and hid it
deep within the mountain.</i>

01:24.501 --> 01:27.044
<i>In his final days, he built a map,</i>

01:27.128 --> 01:30.423
<i>a key leading to this legendary treasure.</i>

01:32.133 --> 01:34.552

01:34.636 --> 01:36.721
<i>most feared adventurers in the world</i>

Dad, you don't understand.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.718
The Subes was busted, so we had to shred.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.177
You had to shred?

03:40.261 --> 03:43.097
Wait a minute.
Why are your lips red?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.181
Were you eating a snow cone?

03:44.265 --> 03:45.558
That was a really good guess.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.310
The police are here, and they're saying

03:47.394 --> 03:49.186
that you bought alcohol for minors.

- Oh, no.
- Oh.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.315
Yeah, that's a crime.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.275
In Europe, the drinking age is like ten.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.651
They could have been European.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.361
What made you think they were European?

03:57.445 --> 03:58.821
- They had a certain je ne sais quoi.
- Yeah.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.032
I think one of them was eating
pain au chocolat.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.533
Ben, I'm gonna retire soon.

What? You know what, no.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.122
Can I stop this for a second?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.957

04:10.041 --> 04:12.084
Johnny. -...talk to my friends like that...

04:12.168 --> 04:13.502
- John!
- Yeah.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.296
Be someplace else right now,
or I'll kill you.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.714
Got it. See you, brother.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.716
Uh, so I don't mean to be rude, but, like,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.886
lunch is usually now, so could we...

04:21.970 --> 04:23.638
I'll go. Thank you, sir.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.514
Skates are cool, though, right?

04:25.598 --> 04:28.392
Goddamn it, would you stand still!

04:28.476 --> 04:30.895
Would it kill you to be
just a little more like Dylan?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.396
I mean, look at that.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.066
God, the guy's a rock star.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.985
A rock star? He's, like, the
most normal guy in the world.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
He's the best.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.072
He looks like he's in the eighth grade.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.323
He's so cool.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.991
Try to pick up on what Dylan has.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.660
Yeah.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.995
I love you.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.581
Yeah. Love you, too.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.458
Did you just look around
to see if anyone was...

04:52.542 --> 04:53.709
- Did not.
- You did. I just saw...

04:53.793 --> 04:55.253
- You went both shoulders.
- Never did.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.420
- Get to work, okay?
- All right.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.964
- Good talk.
- Cool.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.675
Okay, let's... less touching.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.427
- And take off the skates!
- See you. Sorry.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.554
What a morning, man.
That was amazing.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.598
- I feel like Apollo Ohno.
- What are you talking about?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.850
- We just got chewed out.
- Whatever.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.103
Sometimes it does feel like we're getting

05:12.187 --> 05:14.188
- a little too old for this.
- That's what I'm saying, man.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.773
We're in our 20s, you guys.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.608
This is our time to have fun,
hang out with our friends.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.443
We're 26, man. We're not 21.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.778
- There's a big difference.
- Oh, my God.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.571
Next thing I know, you're gonna, like,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.740
go to bed at 10:00 p.m.
and, like, pay your taxes.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.534
- Do you not pay taxes?
- What are you talking about?

05:26.618 --> 05:27.827
You don't have to pay taxes

05:27.911 --> 05:29.745
- under a certain bracket.
- Yeah, you do.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.497
- Yes, you do.
- No, you don't.
- We have to pay... You sh...

05:31.581 --> 05:32.957
- We all have to pay.
- You're gonna get audited.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.542
- I dare the IRS to come to my house.
- They will.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.960
- They'll audit you.
- They will audit you.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.295
- What are you talking about?
- Kick their ass.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.212
Hey! What are you doing?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.547
Turtles can't eat bread!

05:39.631 --> 05:40.965
- Fuck.
- Scoop the bread out.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.383
You go for the turtles.
I'll get the bread.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.634
- Just take the bread out.
- Help.

05:43.718 --> 05:44.719
We don't need to take the turtles out.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.521
Yo, Mart.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.189
You Christian now?

05:57.273 --> 05:59.400
Oh, yeah.
Well, my girlfriend is.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.610
We're really in love.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.861
Whenever I'm around her,
I'm like,

06:01.945 --> 06:04.155
"I don't know what I'd do if you left me."

06:04.239 --> 06:05.364
I'm sorry, the wind is a little loud.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.824
Can you say that again?

06:06.908 --> 06:09.452
I'm just so scared she's gonna leave me.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.911
So the sex is good?

06:10.995 --> 06:13.748
It's great. She always just
lets me lie there.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.917
- I'm going deep. I'm going deep.
- Go long. Go long.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.002
I'm going deep. Hey!

06:18.086 --> 06:20.212
What are you guys doing?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.339
Geez, really?

06:21.423 --> 06:22.840
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, goodness.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.550
It's on me. Just take it.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.885
No, I couldn't.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.386
Hey, John?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.180
Will you help us reach this?

06:29.264 --> 06:31.474
Oh, um, maybe just ask him to jump.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.310
This is a three-in-one
North American birdcall.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.686
Just give it a nice blow in the...

06:35.770 --> 06:37.188
in the hole here, and it's, uh...

06:38.940 --> 06:40.525
- Oh!
- What?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.443
That wasn't right.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.070
I stay still!

06:44.154 --> 06:45.696
Oh, so you're completely still?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.324
I get hard. She slips it in.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.700
End of my job.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.702
Oh, so you're kind of
pumping it from below?

06:51.786 --> 06:54.538
No, I ain't moving a muscle, sister.

06:54.622 --> 06:58.668
She barely has to touch me,
and I make a huge mess.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.711
- Let me try one more time. Yeah, no worries.
- Sure.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.924
- You suck, Ben.
- Wow.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.259
Relax, Mike.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.885
<i>Night, y'all. Good day's work.</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:09.762
- Shut up.
- No.
- Let's get it again tomorrow.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.557
Keep working hard. All right.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.521
Are y'all ready?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.064
I brought the Trulys.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.357
I'm sorry, dude.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.733
I got a big meeting with my dad.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.610
But it's Fly Day Friday.
We do this every week.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.153
We get trashed and fly
in the wingsuit machine.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.613
I know. I'm sorry.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.073
It's just, I'm doing
a big presentation for him

07:29.157 --> 07:31.742
- on why I should run the store.
- Okay. Mart?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.494
I would, but Amy and I got to get ready

07:33.578 --> 07:34.829
for the big day tomorrow.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.248
- The adult baptism.
- Yes.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.250
Getting wet with the good Lord's water.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.960
- Okay.
- It's just a little weird

07:41.044 --> 07:43.045
- to get baptized as an adult.
- Thank you.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.798
Unless you're, like, getting
out of jail or getting sober.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.425
All right, well, more Trulys for me.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.718
Don't drink all of them.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.845
- Okay, I won't. I will.
- Hell yeah.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.346
- Peace, dudes.
- Have a good night.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.222
- See you, man.
- I'll see you at home.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.683
Later.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.195
<i>John was in pain.</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:11.115
<i>And not just because
he was seven Trulys deep,</i>

08:11.199 --> 08:13.909
<i>wing-suiting by himself on a Friday night.</i>

08:13.993 --> 08:17.079

went all the way back</i>

08:49.821 --> 08:51.155

08:51.239 --> 08:52.823
His penis is out!

09:00.415 --> 09:01.874
<i>Yes.</i>

09:01.958 --> 09:04.669

<i>- that had ever happened to him.</i>
- Stop!

09:08.590 --> 09:09.966
<i>Until five seconds later.</i>

09:10.050 --> 09:11.259
Now it's on fire!

♪ Instruction manuals for your dreams... ♪

10:17.409 --> 10:18.909
It's a compass!

10:21.162 --> 10:24.832
<i>Their friendship meant everything to John.</i>

10:24.916 --> 10:27.585
<i>But lately, he had the feeling
that Ben and Martin</i>

10:27.669 --> 10:30.087
<i>were moving on without him.</i>

10:30.171 --> 10:32.757
<i>Martin, I'm so excited.</i>

10:32.841 --> 10:36.052
I think it's gonna be
the perfect baptism outfit.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.264
I love it.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.599
- Really?
- Totally.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.768
I feel like I'm rolling up
to the Met Gala.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.436
Oh, yeah. Beep, beep.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.939
Yeah, and the theme is, like,
the '95 NBA Draft.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.942
Oh. Baby, I feel like
this could be your new look.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.276
- Yeah?
- And then, like,

10:52.360 --> 10:53.611
if you grow your hair out a little bit.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.321
Looking like Jesus?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.781
That suit's a family heirloom.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.991
Yeah, my grandfather
was buried in that suit.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.160
- What?
- Baby, come look at this listing.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.704
I think I found the house for us.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.289
Oh, wow.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.499
This is great.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.460
Right? Look at that kitchen.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.213
So, should we email the Realtor?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.631
Yeah.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.968
But doesn't it just
kind of look like shit?

11:17.052 --> 11:18.678
What?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.012
You know what,
I think I actually remember

11:20.096 --> 11:21.305
seeing an even better place.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.057
- Oh, okay.
- Um...

11:23.141 --> 11:24.475
Yeah, just...

11:24.559 --> 11:26.310
Uh... oh, this one.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.853
This place is cute, right?

11:27.937 --> 11:29.563
This place is kind of weird.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.233
I mean, like, who is that woman?

11:33.735 --> 11:34.944
Oh, my God.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.737
Is she, like, a ghost or something?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.197
I don't know.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.032
I mean, she's eating a cookie
over the garbage.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.784
Why is she in more than one picture?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.828
Well, let's just try to look past that.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.872
- Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, oh!
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

11:48.875 --> 11:50.001
Martin, why would you think this house

11:50.085 --> 11:51.335
is cuter than the other one?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.087
I don't know.
I was, like, freaking out.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.631
Okay, so you're freaking out
about the baptism stuff.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.091
You can be honest with me, okay?

11:57.175 --> 11:59.677
I mean, we don't have to do any of this.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.972
No. Amy, I'm sitting here in this suit,

12:03.056 --> 12:06.434
sweating so much
in your hot-ass apartment.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.727
Yeah.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.520
It's exactly where
I want to be.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.609
Dad, let's face it.
You'll be dead soon.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.901
I'm 55.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.236
And unless you leave the store

12:17.320 --> 12:19.447
in capable hands, it'll die with you.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.327
For years, Trout Plus has been
a leader in the outdoors.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.204
But what if we thought bigger?

12:27.288 --> 12:31.042
What if we brought the outdoors indoors?

12:31.126 --> 12:33.461
Over 50% of the Earth is inside.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.712
Did you know that?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.130
- I...
- Without realizing it,

12:36.214 --> 12:38.674
we've been cutting our own sales in half.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.677
Let's bust it open, Dad, nasty-style.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.804
Trout Plus Everything.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.640
Oh, so we could just sell anything.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.807
- Anything.
- That's great.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.643
- Monocles.
- Absolutely.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.227
- Wizards' hats.
- Why not?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.396
A bidet that shoots gravy at your ass.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.648
So you don't like the idea?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.232
Surely, this is not all you have.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.193
Okay, I've been working on something else.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.861
I'll pitch it to you,
but it's not fully developed.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.905
I'm ready.
I can handle it, I think.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.451
Okay. Hair Salon for Boys.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.494
Oh.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.745
This is fantastic.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.121
- You like it?
- Of course.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.623
It's just, like, a social place

13:10.707 --> 13:12.166
for young boys to come and hang out

13:12.250 --> 13:13.876
like older ladies do at the salon.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.671
Every boy's dream is to be an older woman.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.756
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Yes!

13:18.840 --> 13:20.091
Whoo!

13:20.175 --> 13:22.760
Never show this idea to anyone!

13:22.844 --> 13:25.221
Ever!

13:26.014 --> 13:27.348
Son, pop a squat.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.100
Dad.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.726
You're the last person on Earth

13:30.810 --> 13:32.186
that I would let run this store.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.063
I don't know why you want this.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.274
You don't like the outdoors.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.692
Remember Boy Scouts?

13:37.776 --> 13:40.611
The only badge you got was in
diversity and inclusion.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.779
It's really important.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.281
Dying of exposure in the woods?

13:43.365 --> 13:44.782
"Don't worry, I've got

13:44.866 --> 13:46.617
my diversity and inclusion badge."

13:46.701 --> 13:49.245
Well, what if you're dying
from exposure to hatred?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.205
Do you know that every day of my life,

13:51.289 --> 13:52.957
I've killed a living thing?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.458
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.711
I punched a field mouse three weeks ago.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.254
I would give a bobcat the finger,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.506
- if that's something, I mean...
- They don't care.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.800
Dad, I just need a little
more time to prove myself.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.385
More time? You're 26.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.846
Kids today prove themselves
when they're like 12.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.514
Have you seen <i>Stranger Things?</i>

14:08.598 --> 14:11.142
The kids on that show
are insanely talented.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.977
What are you talking about?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.937
I think you're just seeing
the glass as not having

14:15.021 --> 14:16.731
enough water in it, as opposed to having

14:16.815 --> 14:18.190
more than an adequate amount of water.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.734
That's not how the saying goes.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.528
Glass half full versus glass half empty.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.822
Yeah, well, your generation
loves to shorten everything

14:24.906 --> 14:26.991
till it makes no fucking sense.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.909
As your father--

14:28.993 --> 14:31.954
and I say this with all the warmth I can--

14:32.038 --> 14:35.499
I only care about two things:
money and power.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.419
And you have neither one.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.755
<i>All right, boys, finally, poker night.</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:41.964
Place your bets.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.674
Can we play something else?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.092
I'm bored.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.510
Hey, John, where are your roommates at?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.346
I don't know, like, busy again. It sucks.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.641
I just got to fucking remind
them that we're a dream team.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.017
Ben, John, Mart.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.144
That's, like, what it's always been.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.771
So, what do you want from your friends?

14:56.855 --> 14:59.065
I don't know, hang out
forever, travel the world,

14:59.149 --> 15:00.816
go somewhere exotic like London.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.443
You sound kind of sad.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.111
I sound kind of sad? Wow.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.614
- Dude!
- Shut up, Jason. I'll email your mom.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.990
Fuck you, fat boy!

15:08.074 --> 15:09.033
You're playing poker with 11-year-olds.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.535
- Fuck you, Jason!
- Asshole!

15:11.619 --> 15:12.703
You can't just...

15:12.787 --> 15:14.121
Hey, I'll kick your ass.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.332
- Hey! Ow! Oh!
- Do you want a piece of me?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.084
- Wow, okay.
- Hey! Come on!

15:18.168 --> 15:20.253
- How do you like that? No more game.
- Come on!

15:23.965 --> 15:26.468
Dude, what is wrong with my algorithm?

15:27.302 --> 15:29.971

Deetch Nordwind,

15:34.809 --> 15:36.352
the guy who went missing?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.188
He was looking for treasure:
the bust of Marie Antoinette.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.982
Somebody has the key out there

15:41.066 --> 15:43.025
to finding this treasure,
sitting in someone's room,

15:43.109 --> 15:45.194
and they have no idea they have the key

15:45.278 --> 15:48.739
to something worth over $100 million.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.116
If it's you, go!

16:13.098 --> 16:14.473
Shut up.

He's petrified right now.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.400
- Looks like he's being held at gunpoint.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.487
- Are you kidding me, man?
- What?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.030
You just sucked the bread off that?

17:11.114 --> 17:12.740
I said I'm more of a fan of the blanket.

In the words of John Lennon,

17:26.629 --> 17:28.172
I was a sinner, but now I'm saved,

17:28.256 --> 17:30.091
and it's all thanks to Amy.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.842
Aw.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.678
I can't... I can't take credit.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.555
Hmm. You know, thank God

17:36.639 --> 17:39.225
Amy finally found a good man like Martin.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.560
Martin is a-a good boy now,

17:41.644 --> 17:44.105
but you should've seen him
back in the day.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.523
He was so awesome.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.732
What did he do?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.192
Like, work at a soup kitchen?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.860
No, he would get, like, blackout drunk

17:49.944 --> 17:51.529
and become a character.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.866
It's hard to explain.
I-I can show you a video.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.535
<i>This is Lawrence.</i>

17:57.619 --> 17:59.412
<i>He was so much more than just a voice</i>

17:59.496 --> 18:01.622
<i>Martin would do when he was drunk.</i>

18:01.706 --> 18:03.082
<i>He was fearless.</i>

18:03.166 --> 18:05.251
<i>Like when the dean tried
to shut down our party,</i>

18:05.335 --> 18:07.587
<i>Lawrence beat his ass.</i>

18:07.671 --> 18:09.297
<i>And when my professor tried to fail me,</i>

18:09.381 --> 18:11.257
<i>Lawrence beat his ass.</i>

18:11.341 --> 18:14.802
<i>And when a lunch lady
banned him from the cafeteria,</i>

18:14.886 --> 18:17.888
<i>Lawrence dated her
for three beautiful months,</i>

18:17.972 --> 18:19.390
<i>until her husband found out.</i>

18:19.474 --> 18:21.726
<i>And then he beat his ass.</i>

18:21.810 --> 18:23.477
<i>And when Martin met Amy,</i>

18:23.561 --> 18:26.731
he vowed to never become Lawrence again.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.025
- So, that's that.
- Oh.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.484
Thank God people change.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.947
You know, life is full
of mountains and valleys.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.574
That's not what I'm saying.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.826
Dad, I'm sorry.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.286
It's so important to have

18:40.370 --> 18:41.662
- that moral compass.
- <i>Compass.</i>

18:41.746 --> 18:43.247
Not to mention the fact

18:43.331 --> 18:45.249
- that he's going to treasure
- <i>Treasure.</i>

18:45.333 --> 18:46.667
- all of the friends
- <i>Friends.</i>

18:46.751 --> 18:48.211
that he makes here.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.427
Mountain, compass, treasure, friends.

18:56.511 --> 18:59.263
<i>Mountain, compass, treasure, friends.</i>

18:59.347 --> 19:02.433
<i>Mountain, compass, treasure, friends.</i>

19:02.517 --> 19:04.101
<i>Mountain, compass, compass, friends,</i>

19:04.185 --> 19:05.436
<i>friends, treasure, treasure, friends.</i>

19:05.520 --> 19:07.480
<i>Mountain, compass, compass...</i>

19:07.564 --> 19:09.231
I got to go!

19:11.401 --> 19:13.527
Get your fucking hands off me!

19:13.611 --> 19:16.239
Sorry. Sorry.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.122
Dude, he ruined the baptism after-party.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.457
He didn't ruin it, man.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.459
- It was still cool.
- No, he's losing it.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.128
He's always alone in the house
doing the saddest shit.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.130
- It's depressing.
- Yeah, I-I'm with you, man.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.633
I'm... I think, though, he's
just going through something,

19:35.717 --> 19:37.468
but in general, he's totally fine.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.803
Oh, hello.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.389
- Oh, man.
- I was just taking an evening bath.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.307
- With your computer?
- Yes.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.142
Doing research.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.186
While I was at
the baptism reception today,

19:47.270 --> 19:49.689
I came upon an enlightening discovery.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.732
- Why are you talking like that?
- Guys, I think

19:51.816 --> 19:53.401
I know where the treasure
of Foggy Mountain is,

19:53.485 --> 19:55.403
and I think we should go get it.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.154
The treasure of Foggy Mountain?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.572
Like from when we were kids?

19:58.656 --> 20:02.201
It all started when I saw
a TikTok about this guy.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.620
Deetch Nordwind.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.997
Whoa.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.959
You have like 40 tabs open?
What are you doing, man?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.919
Well, that's how much
research I've been doing.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.547
Well, a lot of these are clips
from <i>Jennifer's Body.</i>

20:14.631 --> 20:16.674
- Is that part of the research?
- Um...

20:16.758 --> 20:18.551
- You could just rent the movie
at that point.
- Yeah.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.845
Enough, please. Can we just
go back to the first one?

20:20.929 --> 20:22.555
This is very important.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.473
The treasure Deetch was after was hidden

20:24.557 --> 20:27.518
by a French naval explorer
named Jean Pierre Le Roche.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.686
"J.L."

20:28.770 --> 20:31.522
This was Jean Pierre Le Roche's insignia.

20:31.606 --> 20:35.860
Our compass that we found
as kids is a treasure map.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.903
Here, check this out.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.865
It aligns perfectly.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.366
- Huh.
- And in my research,

20:42.450 --> 20:45.119
I found out that he hid it
in some kind of chamber,

20:45.203 --> 20:46.871
but nobody's been able to find it.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.289
What's that?

20:48.373 --> 20:49.832
Looks like a chamber.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.250
This is real?

20:51.334 --> 20:53.544
Ben, can you imagine
what your dad would say

20:53.628 --> 20:55.546
if you found the treasure
of Foggy Mountain?

20:55.630 --> 20:57.632
I guarantee you he will look at you

20:57.716 --> 20:59.717
like he's never looked at you before.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.345
And, Mart, Amy's 25.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.596
That's like 62 in Christian years.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.389
- At least.
- If it was up to her,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.266
she would have like 12 kids by now.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.517
You can't afford 12 kids.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.728
No. I'd have to feed 'em dog food.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.396
- Yeah.
- Or hay.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.358
Or you feed 'em steak and caviar
like babies should be fed.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.360
You could with a hundred mil.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.320
- What?
- A hundred million dollars?

21:19.404 --> 21:22.406
We are sitting here
on this warm summer night

21:22.490 --> 21:25.869
looking at the key to changing our lives.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.997
What are we waiting for?

21:35.503 --> 21:37.797
Hey! Oh!

21:37.881 --> 21:40.424
Hey! Oh! Hey!

21:42.177 --> 21:44.553
- Oh, shit.
- I hope your friendship falls apart!

21:44.637 --> 21:46.389
- What did he just say?
- We're good. We're good.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.225
Oh, snap.
Brought the Lawrence shades.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.519
Oh, my God! Come on, Mart.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.229
Is L-Man coming out to play?

21:53.313 --> 21:54.522
Hey, can you not, man?

21:54.606 --> 21:57.024
Last time I was Lawrence was a disaster.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.442
The cops said, if I'm even seen

21:58.526 --> 22:00.278
on a roof again, they can shoot to kill.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.154
You know what, man, just forget it.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.698
I'm sorry I brought it up.

22:03.782 --> 22:06.117
<i>John just hoped this trip could</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:08.494
<i>remind his friends why
they made such a great team.</i>

22:08.578 --> 22:09.829
Whoo!

22:09.913 --> 22:11.998
<i>By the way, I'm John Goodman</i>

22:12.082 --> 22:15.084
<i>from</i> The Big Lebowski
<i>and a ton of other shit.</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:16.544
<i>Anyhoo...</i>

22:18.546 --> 22:20.965
Well, well, well.
What do we have here, Lisa?

22:21.049 --> 22:23.676
I wonder who threw
the illegal gender reveal party

22:23.760 --> 22:25.469
that caused a small forest fire.

22:25.553 --> 22:26.971
- Hmm.
- I don't know, Lisa.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.432
I wonder who could it possibly have been.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.142
Come on, guys. Fess up.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.560
Which one of you weirdos did it?

22:32.644 --> 22:33.811
Are you kidding me, man?

22:33.895 --> 22:35.313
- Huh?
- You look like you've been

22:35.397 --> 22:36.897
getting your face ridden by an Avatar.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.316
- Just bustin'.
- Mm-hmm.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.652
Whoa.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.154
Whoa. You guys all in line?

22:43.238 --> 22:46.157
Oh, snap.
Why is this guy all blue?

22:46.241 --> 22:48.075
I'm having a baby boy!

22:49.828 --> 22:51.203
Congrats, buddy.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.456
Hey. Can I get you something to drink? -

22:53.540 --> 22:55.082
Like if I was a waiter.
I'm not.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.627
- But you do work here?
- Yes.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.170
I was wondering if you, uh, could point us

22:59.254 --> 23:00.755
in kind of like a direction
where we could go see,

23:00.839 --> 23:02.340
like, a cool, like, site or, like,

23:02.424 --> 23:03.507
- vista or something.
- Oh, my God. Yeah.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.842
But it has to be along this trail...

23:04.926 --> 23:06.385
Sorry, am I, like, leaning in on you?

23:06.469 --> 23:08.012
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.347
Let me just take a look.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.098
- What is that?
- Don't tell anybody.

23:11.182 --> 23:14.018
We are, um, going to hunt for
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.354
- : Wait, what?
- I swear to God, yeah.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.356
- Shut up.
- I know.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.774
Our friendship was kind of...

23:19.858 --> 23:21.400
- We needed a little juice.
- Yeah.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.652
Maybe you guys could've just went

23:22.736 --> 23:24.028
to Dave & Buster's or something.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.196
Can I give you some advice,

23:25.280 --> 23:26.489
- man, about fatherhood?
- Please.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.032
Never cheat on your son with another boy.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.368
- I'm gonna remember that one.
- John, come on, let's go.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.702
All right, I'm coming.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.704
Uh, it was nice meeting you.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.539
Bye.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.461
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.213
- Oh, my God, horses.
- A horse.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.215
- Yeah, give us a lasso.
- Hey!

23:44.299 --> 23:46.050
Come on, give us a lasso.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.637
Left, right, left...

23:49.721 --> 23:51.639
I haven't been outside
this long in like 15 years.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.057
Yeah, neither have I.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.392
I had one of these as a kid.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.227
- Oh, he's on the belly!
- Oh, on the belly!

23:56.311 --> 23:57.687
Ew, dude. What are you eating?

23:57.771 --> 23:59.730
They're smoochies.
Amy makes 'em.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.274
Smoochies?

24:01.358 --> 24:02.566
What's in it?

24:02.650 --> 24:03.985
It's mostly wheat germ and pitted dates.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.236
That sounds like shit, and those look like

24:05.320 --> 24:06.570
- little turds.
- Ben.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.197
- Dude, they're the best.
- Come on.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.240
- Stop eating it.
- Mart.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.700
Dude, IMAX on a phone, like,

24:10.784 --> 24:12.702
- isn't that bad.
- Yeah, you're so right.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.745
<i>Jennifer's Body</i> is kind of amazing.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.747
♪ Girl, you got to give in ♪

24:16.831 --> 24:19.333
♪ Sooner or later... ♪

24:19.417 --> 24:21.877
I hate this job.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.088
We have had, what, like 12 jobs?

24:24.172 --> 24:26.924
Like, day care, caterer.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.093
Then we were bus drivers together.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.428
Wish we had no jobs.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.762
Wish were out there searching for treasure

24:31.846 --> 24:33.765
like those guys with a treasure map.

24:34.557 --> 24:35.808
- Treasure map?
- Yeah.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.018
The cute guys that came in earlier--

24:37.102 --> 24:38.644
the, like, model and his bodyguards.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.271
I didn't see nobody cute.

24:40.355 --> 24:41.606
I had chemistry with one of them,

24:41.690 --> 24:43.190
but I don't know,
I wouldn't hook...

24:43.274 --> 24:45.735
I don't want to hook up.
I don't even know the guy.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.528
I'm not... I don't know him!

24:47.612 --> 24:51.616
Cute? The ginger one
looked like a colonial ghost.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.744
The one with glasses, he looked
like Tim Burton drew him.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.829
And then the short one, he got
titties bigger than mine.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.289
We probably wear the same size bra.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.582
They had a treasure map.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.459
They treasure map
with, like, an "X" on it.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.169
We should follow them.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.129
Okay, people always look for
the treasure of Foggy Mountain,

25:05.213 --> 25:07.131
- but they don't find it.
- Come on, Lisa.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.009
We gonna steal that map.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.521
- Come on, dude.
- Oh, my God.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.856
- What?
- What was that?

25:23.940 --> 25:25.483
- What was that?
- It's a birdcall, man.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.318
I'm trying to get good
at this stuff, okay?

25:27.402 --> 25:28.903
It sounds like a guy screaming.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.571
It feels like you should just
be able to blow into it.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.073
Like, it doesn't seem like a complicated...

25:32.157 --> 25:33.950
- Stop it, man.
- Oh, my God.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.493
- What is happening?
- How are you so bad at that, though?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.328
I don't know, man.
It's frustrating to me.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.459
It worked.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.169
- Oh, my God.
- Holy shit.

25:45.253 --> 25:46.671
That is a full-ass hawk.

25:46.755 --> 25:48.839
Oh, my God. Okay.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.008
- Sort of glaring at us.
- Yeah, you see that?

25:51.092 --> 25:52.677
- Maybe we head out.
- Yeah, maybe we...

25:52.761 --> 25:54.845
Yep. Bye, little girlie.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.347
See ya.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.682
Can't believe that we saw a hawk.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.100
- Yeah. That's cool.
- I know, man.

25:59.184 --> 26:00.393
Yeah.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.106
Is it following us?

26:05.190 --> 26:07.108
Feels like it is.

26:07.192 --> 26:09.277
What's going on here?

26:11.488 --> 26:12.905
Think it's just walking.
It's all good.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.075
I think it looks like it's hunting us.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.953
- Well, why don't we just
pick it up a little?
- Yes, sir.

26:20.872 --> 26:22.331
- Oh, my God. Go, go, go!
- Go! Go!

26:22.415 --> 26:23.708
Go! Go to the rock!

26:23.792 --> 26:25.209
Go, go! Fucking traverse it!

26:25.293 --> 26:26.502
- Okay.
- Traverse the rock!

26:26.586 --> 26:29.088
Wait, stop! Stop it! Stop!

26:32.967 --> 26:34.885
Does it not know it can fly?

26:34.969 --> 26:36.721
- What? Ew, dude.
- Oh, yuck.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.931
What a little fucking weirdo.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.100
Why did it walk away with an attitude?

26:41.184 --> 26:42.768
- Fuck, man. Jesus.
- Mart, that was scary, buddy.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.729
- That was very scary.
- Holy hell.

26:46.147 --> 26:47.815
How unbelievable, dude.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.567
- So beautiful.
- Mm.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.694
Just us, Mother Nature.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.363
- This ain't half bad.
- Yeah.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.240
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

26:56.324 --> 26:57.950
You boys got a camping permit?

26:58.034 --> 26:59.577
- Uh, not...
- Ben said he had one.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.954
I ha... I might have it on-on my phone.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.914
Chill, boys.
We're messing with you.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.626
Do you guys want a drink,

27:06.710 --> 27:08.920
or should I go fuck myself?

27:09.671 --> 27:10.963
- A drink.
- Yeah, a drink.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.006
- Yeah, let's do a drink.
- Let's do a drink.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.261
Try to flip it.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.265
Uh, okay. Oh.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.683
I'm sad.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.143
<i>- Manchester by the Sea.</i>
- Yeah.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.938
Okay, um, literally scariest
movie of all time.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.773
<i>- The Grinch.</i>
- Are you guys seeing this?

27:28.857 --> 27:31.442
- I can't believe we just did that.
- Is that not amazing?

27:31.526 --> 27:32.735
And time. Zero points.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.195
You guys are not allowed to talk.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.781
- Oh. I always forget that.
- Oh. It's charades.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.825
Okay, well, since we done
and y'all got zero points,

27:39.909 --> 27:41.452
let's talk about something else.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.245
Let's talk about the treasure...

27:43.329 --> 27:44.664
Dinner is served.

27:44.748 --> 27:45.998
Who's hungry, y'all?

27:46.082 --> 27:48.459
Whew-ee, I hope I did it right.

27:48.543 --> 27:49.877
I think I did, probably.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.879
Oh, the head's still intact, if anyone...

27:51.963 --> 27:53.464
- Oh.
- It's a delicacy.

27:53.548 --> 27:54.883
Dude, don't eat it.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.969
Mmm.

27:58.053 --> 28:00.096
Interesting flavor palette.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.765
It's, like, hard on the outside
but so raw on the inside.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.642
Good, though.
I think that's right.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.310
You were really, really good.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.020
- Hey, Lisa.
- Yeah?

28:08.104 --> 28:10.731
Hey, can I talk to you over
here, just me and you, please?

28:10.815 --> 28:11.857
Oh.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.192
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.403
- Cool.
- Lisa.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.655
You guys see that?

28:17.739 --> 28:18.990
She's flirting with me.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.658
Dude, you guys were vibing.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.827
We're not even here for that.
Like, this isn't a sex trip.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.787
But when's the next time
we are gonna take a sex trip?

28:24.871 --> 28:26.706
- I don't know.
- Did you hear that?

28:26.790 --> 28:28.082
John thinks
<i>The Grinch</i> is scary, too.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.750
It's like, yeah,
just 'cause it's a Christmas

28:29.834 --> 28:31.127
doesn't mean he's not a monster.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.628
Yeah. Lisa, Lisa,
I need you to focus, okay?

28:32.712 --> 28:33.838
We are here for one thing

28:33.922 --> 28:35.673
and one thing only, and that is...

28:35.757 --> 28:36.966
- To hook up.
- ...to get the treasure map.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.676
- Okay.
- It's to get the treasure map.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.344
- Lisa, I need you to focus, okay?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'm...

28:40.428 --> 28:41.971
You know what? No, I'm not
prepared for this, man.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.347
- Come on. Why?
- No, I'm not.

28:43.431 --> 28:45.975
God, I've never trimmed my bush.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.518
It's like, what am I gonna do?

28:47.602 --> 28:49.270
I thought you were gonna say
a whole list of things.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.771
You go in there in the tent with John,

28:50.855 --> 28:52.315
you get the treasure map...

28:52.399 --> 28:54.400
And if we hook up, it's like,
okay, we hooked up.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.444
I don't care if you're
hooking up, mid-hookup.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.195
- You can be grabbing...
- Grabbing the treasure map.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.780
...the treasure map.
That's fine.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.117
Lisa, don't let me down, okay?
I need you.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.869
So, what are we, um...

29:04.953 --> 29:07.204
Wh-Why are we in here?

29:07.288 --> 29:08.789
What do you mean?

29:08.873 --> 29:10.082
No, I just...

29:10.166 --> 29:11.542
There's a party going on out there,

29:11.626 --> 29:13.002
- and now we're in this tent.
- Yeah.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.546
But I-I mean, I'm not mad. I...

29:15.630 --> 29:18.007
Just funny, like, I feel like
I should be, like, nervous,

29:18.091 --> 29:20.969
but, like, I... yeah,
I feel like I like you.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.430
Oh.

29:24.514 --> 29:26.223
Well, I like you.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.310
We're on a date.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.063
Taylor, truth or dare?

29:35.358 --> 29:36.776
Truth.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.987
What is your worst memory, like, ever?

29:40.196 --> 29:42.114
So, wait, what are the rules again?

29:42.198 --> 29:44.575
Okay, so the game is you have
to sing as earnest as you can,

29:44.659 --> 29:45.868
and it has to be an original song.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.244
- You...
- No jokes.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.871
- Okay. Okay, but you go first.
- No funny voice.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.081

with your dad?

30:47.222 --> 30:48.472
- No.
- See, I told you,

30:48.556 --> 30:49.974
you look so good
with your hair slicked back.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.225
I don't think that it looks good.

30:51.309 --> 30:52.685
I don't think
I can pull it off.

30:52.769 --> 30:53.894
It looks really good.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.563
You're, like, the hottest guy.

30:55.647 --> 30:58.024
- Are you serious?
- Mm, yeah.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.942
Hotter than Johnny Knoxville?

31:00.026 --> 31:01.819
Yeah. Definitely.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.155
- What about Steve-O?
- Yeah.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.407
And he's, like,
my ultimate celebrity crush.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.075
That feels good.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.786
So you know how older ladies
have this great place

31:10.870 --> 31:12.830
where they can come and socialize and gab?

31:12.914 --> 31:14.832
And so I got to thinking,

31:14.916 --> 31:16.792
why don't little boys have
a place like that?

31:16.876 --> 31:18.836
Why is it just little boys?
I'm confused.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.421
This would just be little boys and Ben.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.506
You sound like you got a little
Never Neverland crackin'

31:22.590 --> 31:24.383
- but you get a haircut at the end.
- No, no, no.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.136
Hold it really tight.

31:28.471 --> 31:29.680
Three of hearts.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.307
Oh, my God.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.726
What is the saddest thought
you can think of right now?

31:33.810 --> 31:36.687
My grandma will never make out
with anyone ever again.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.315
That's so sweet that
that's your saddest thought.

31:44.112 --> 31:46.447
- I didn't fart once, okay?
- I can smell it.

31:46.531 --> 31:49.241
You farted your ass all the way
around this goddamn campsite.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.118
- He did not fart his ass all the way around.
- I didn't...

31:51.202 --> 31:53.329
I... Sometimes it smells outside.

31:53.413 --> 31:54.705
Smell like bussy.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.874
It... it doesn't smell like bussy.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.377
- Okay.
- What's... what's bussy?

32:00.420 --> 32:02.838
I don't want this night to end,
but I'm getting sleepy.

32:02.922 --> 32:05.133
Yeah. Me, too.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.386
This was really, really nice.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.237
Hey, y'all.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.075
Guys, why are we tied up?

32:31.159 --> 32:33.411
I'm coming. I'm coming.

32:40.168 --> 32:41.586
- What happened?
- Those mean ladies tied us up

32:41.670 --> 32:42.837
and stole all our shit.

32:42.921 --> 32:44.505
What?

32:44.589 --> 32:46.257
Get us out of here! It's like
a million fucking degrees!

32:46.341 --> 32:47.800
You guys,
I'm gonna use my mouth.

32:47.884 --> 32:49.594
I'm free!

32:51.262 --> 32:53.264
- Dude, you slept so late.
- It's 2:00!

32:53.348 --> 32:54.640
What the hell happened?

32:54.724 --> 32:56.892
Taylor tied us up, and Lisa stole the map.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.894
Wait, what? No, she didn't.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.062
Yeah. Kiss the treasure goodbye.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.732
I got love-bombed?

33:02.816 --> 33:04.108
- Wh-What?
- What?

33:04.192 --> 33:05.943
- I'm going to bed.
- Don't go to bed.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.778
I'm sorry you got love-bombed.
I think we shouldn't give up.

33:07.862 --> 33:10.615
Is there anything else
that we have or could use...

33:10.699 --> 33:11.949
So uncomfortable, dude.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.618
I'm trying to sleep in a bunch of dirt.

33:13.702 --> 33:15.244
- Yeah, and you slept like 13 hours, man!
- You guys?

33:15.328 --> 33:16.954
- Shut up!
- Do we still have the compass? The...

33:17.038 --> 33:18.789
- Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Maybe we can make another map.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.666
Oh, great.
We have a useless compass.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.127
- What are you talking about?
- It doesn't point north.

33:23.211 --> 33:24.962
It just points to the middle of the woods.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.674
It always has. That's why
I put a picture on it.

33:29.718 --> 33:30.968
Wait, wait, John.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.428
Ha-Have you looked at this in a while?

33:32.512 --> 33:36.141
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find"?

33:38.727 --> 33:40.394
"Let me be your guide..."

33:40.478 --> 33:41.854
Yeah, and it's not pointing north.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.981
"...and riches you will find"?

33:44.065 --> 33:45.650
So, where is it pointing, John?

33:45.734 --> 33:47.526
I think that that's pointing
to the treasure.

33:47.610 --> 33:49.111
- That's what we said.
- That's what we were saying.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.655
- We figured that out.
- Oh, my God, dude!

33:50.739 --> 33:51.822
"Let me be your guide..."

33:51.906 --> 33:53.324
"And riches you will find."

33:53.408 --> 33:54.992
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."

33:55.076 --> 33:56.494
Those rangers think they can mess with me?

33:56.578 --> 33:59.580
- Uh-uh!
- I don't think so, Lisa!

33:59.664 --> 34:01.415
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, John, John.

34:01.499 --> 34:03.042
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- It's just hard.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.293
- It's really... it's a lot.
- It was recent,

34:04.377 --> 34:05.503
and I really genuinely liked her.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.088
- Aw.
- You know what we got to do?

34:07.172 --> 34:08.714
- Get there first. Whoo!
- Yes.

34:08.798 --> 34:11.175
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."

34:11.259 --> 34:13.177
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."

34:14.763 --> 34:16.055
Who stole their treasure map?

34:16.139 --> 34:17.598
We did!

34:17.682 --> 34:19.767
- Yeah, fuck those guys!
- I do feel guilty, though.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.894
- I really connected with John.
- Which one was John?

34:21.978 --> 34:24.855
Oh, the one that looked like
Danny DeVito got a glow-up.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.315
Right. Who gives a fuck?

34:26.399 --> 34:28.276
We're millionaires.
We can get any man we want.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.612
- Hey, Method Man!
- Hi, John!

34:32.280 --> 34:34.240
Grisham, the writer.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.367
Have you read <i>The Firm?</i>
I couldn't put it down.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.452
I don't want to talk about John Grisham.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.211
So, the treasure's that way.

34:53.510 --> 34:56.220
Well, I mean, how are we gonna cross this?

34:56.304 --> 34:58.055
I mean, we could try to find,
like, another route.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.224
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Guys?

35:00.308 --> 35:02.268
I have a good idea.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.980
Wingsuits.

35:06.064 --> 35:07.732
Dude, what?

35:07.816 --> 35:09.442
We're gonna fly over that?

35:09.526 --> 35:11.277
We do it all the time in the machine.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.613
- This is not a machine.
- Guys...

35:13.697 --> 35:15.448
I'm doing it.

35:16.449 --> 35:17.617
Come on!

35:20.412 --> 35:21.746
Are you sure you want to do this?

35:21.830 --> 35:24.248
It feels like it's getting
extremely windy.

35:24.332 --> 35:25.625
I just need you guys to trust me, okay?

35:25.709 --> 35:27.251
You know what?
Go ahead and film me,

35:27.335 --> 35:28.628
'cause I'm pretty sure my old man

35:28.712 --> 35:30.755
is gonna want to see his boy in action.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.256
Okay.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.467
Oh, my God, it is steep.

35:37.345 --> 35:39.889
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:39.973 --> 35:42.183
Ben!

35:42.267 --> 35:44.268
Ben, you're like a kite!

35:44.352 --> 35:47.104
- What?
- You're like my kite, Ben.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.399
I feel like I'm at the beach right now.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.109
Oh, like a kite!

35:54.029 --> 35:56.197
- John, cut the video.
- Got it.

35:57.407 --> 35:59.116
I sent it to your dad.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.576
I'm sorry.

36:00.660 --> 36:01.494
What? No!

36:01.578 --> 36:02.828
- Shit.
- Are you kidding me?

36:02.912 --> 36:04.163
- Ben!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:05.540 --> 36:07.458
Ben, you're taking me up with you!

36:07.542 --> 36:09.335
- Oh, no! No, stop!
- The cliff!

36:09.419 --> 36:10.711
- The cliff!
- No, stop, stop!

36:10.795 --> 36:13.381
No!

36:22.307 --> 36:23.641
- Oh, my God, is everyone okay?
- Ow.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.518
- No, dude, that hurt.
- Dudes?

36:25.602 --> 36:27.144
I did seriously bruise my taint.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.562
We almost died.

36:28.646 --> 36:30.314
And there are fucking ants in this tree.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.441
Well, you miss 100% of
the shots you don't take, man.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.277
- Shut up.
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up, man.
-No, dude.

36:34.361 --> 36:37.113
Ben, you failed, okay?
You failed.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.489
Come on, Martin.

36:38.573 --> 36:41.200
Dear God, please save me
from this terrible trip

36:41.284 --> 36:42.785
with my two awful friends.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.870
Please lead us to the treasure,
and I promise I'll be

36:44.954 --> 36:47.999
a good Christian like the Pope
or Chance the Rapper.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.500
Wait. Guys, shut up, shut up.

36:49.584 --> 36:50.960
What?

36:51.044 --> 36:52.462
Dude, look.

36:54.381 --> 36:57.008
Is-is that the chamber thing
from the compass?

36:58.468 --> 37:00.344
- Dude, it-it is.
- Oh!

37:00.428 --> 37:02.179
- No way!
- Wow, that's it.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.764
- We fucking found it!
- Oh, my God.

37:03.848 --> 37:06.350
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."

37:06.434 --> 37:08.894
"Let me be your guide,
and riches you will find."

37:08.978 --> 37:11.188
- Dude, I got us here.
- Shut the fuck up.

37:14.943 --> 37:16.903
Holy shit, dude.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.822
Oh, my God.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.700
How do we get in?

37:23.743 --> 37:25.995
- Um...
- Wait, yo, yo, yo.

37:26.079 --> 37:28.372
Do you have the compass?

37:28.456 --> 37:30.959
- Give-give me the compass.
- The compass. Go, go, go.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.518
It smells like bussy in here.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.854
Dude, don't start saying that now.

37:51.938 --> 37:55.399
This must have been where
Le Roche hid before he died.

37:57.235 --> 37:58.611
Dude, what?

37:58.695 --> 38:01.030
- It must be here.
- Oh, my God.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.323
Guys, look.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.951
That looks like
SpongeBob's door.

38:06.745 --> 38:08.746
- What?
- Like on his pineapple house.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.373
Dude, that's-that's the treasure door.

38:10.457 --> 38:11.666
That's probably where the treasure is.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.459
It's, like, a giant steel...
Open it.

38:13.543 --> 38:15.753
Dude, open it.

38:15.837 --> 38:17.088
I think it's locked.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.923
- Is there a key?
- I don't know.

38:19.007 --> 38:20.758
Okay, obviously, it wasn't
just gonna be open, right?

38:20.842 --> 38:22.593
Maybe this is like an escape room.

38:22.677 --> 38:25.137
Maybe we just have to look
around for a-a key or a clue.

38:25.221 --> 38:28.016
Use your brains.
We can figure this out.

38:29.309 --> 38:30.726
Shit.

38:30.810 --> 38:32.270
Wait.

38:32.354 --> 38:34.689

find it."

38:44.199 --> 38:45.366
Botched the rhyme there.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.867
You know what that means, though?

38:46.951 --> 38:48.286
We have to be in harmony.

38:48.370 --> 38:49.578
We have to work together.

38:49.662 --> 38:51.748
Of course.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.918
Dang it.

38:57.754 --> 39:00.256
I can't believe we came all this way

45:35.610 --> 45:37.945
You left me tied up in the
woods and stole all my shit.

45:38.029 --> 45:39.280
That was Taylor's idea.

45:39.364 --> 45:40.740
Oh, so you do whatever you told?

45:40.824 --> 45:42.033
You know what, Lisa?

45:42.117 --> 45:43.743
The other night meant a lot to me.

45:43.827 --> 45:45.620
- And you fucked me.
- I didn't fuck you.

45:45.704 --> 45:47.204
Maybe I would've if the tent was bigger.

45:47.288 --> 45:48.706
- What are you talking about?
- I said get a bigger tent!

45:48.790 --> 45:50.958
Lisa! I got the treasure!
I got the...!

45:51.042 --> 45:53.210
Oh, my God.

45:53.294 --> 45:54.837
What the fuck?
You just hit a woman!

45:54.921 --> 45:57.298
I-I apologize for him.
I, for one, would nev...

45:57.382 --> 46:01.218
- Oh, oh! Oh, my God! Hypocrite!
- Okay, so I hit one woman.

46:01.302 --> 46:02.637
That's not, in the grand sch...

46:03.972 --> 46:05.264
Oh, my... Ew!

46:05.348 --> 46:06.474
- We shouldn't be talking.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

46:06.558 --> 46:08.100
I-I... I'm sorry.

46:08.184 --> 46:10.311
I know I stole from you, but I
was doing it for my friend.

46:10.395 --> 46:12.063
- I really like you.
- No, you don't.

46:12.147 --> 46:13.522
I knew it was too good to be true.

46:13.606 --> 46:15.232
I really do.

46:15.316 --> 46:16.776
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

46:16.860 --> 46:18.152
- You swear?
- Yeah.

46:18.236 --> 46:20.029
- You're not lying to me?
- I'm not lying to you.

46:20.113 --> 46:21.781
- Just to trick me again?
- I'm being more real than ever.

46:21.865 --> 46:23.407
I really like you.

46:23.491 --> 46:24.742
What's your favorite bagel?

46:24.826 --> 46:25.910
Everything bagel
with the stuff shaken off.

46:25.994 --> 46:27.328
Oh, God, I can't fight it.

46:27.412 --> 46:29.246
- You're perfect, girl.
- Oh, you're perfect, too.

46:29.330 --> 46:31.499
Where is it? Where'd it go?

46:36.504 --> 46:37.881
Yo, guys.

46:50.352 --> 46:51.936
- Ben?
- Hey.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.021
- Were you about to leave without us?
- Hmm?

46:54.105 --> 46:56.315
- Jesus Christ, man.
- Dude, get-get in.

46:56.399 --> 46:58.359
- You were gonna leave without us.
- I got the thing.

46:58.443 --> 46:59.819
- John, let's go!
- John, come on, let's go!

46:59.903 --> 47:01.195
Just one sec.

47:01.279 --> 47:02.989
Lisa, what the fuck are you doing?

47:03.073 --> 47:05.116
John, we're gonna abandon you
if you don't come, man.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.659
What?

47:06.743 --> 47:08.286
Sorry.

47:08.370 --> 47:10.079
- Oh, oh, dude, I dropped her.
God, I dropped her.
- John?

47:10.163 --> 47:11.622
- Dudes, I dropped her.
- What the hell, Lisa?

47:11.706 --> 47:12.957
- Are you okay?
- You in?
- Yeah.

47:13.041 --> 47:14.542
Maybe he's telling them to come back?

47:15.502 --> 47:17.086
Sorry!

47:17.170 --> 47:20.632
Man, Lisa, see what the fuck...
you see what you did?

47:22.425 --> 47:23.801
That was insane.

47:23.885 --> 47:26.262
I hope Lisa's not mad
that I stole her cart.

47:27.263 --> 47:29.473
Hey, you guys haven't talked
in like 45 minutes.

47:29.557 --> 47:31.267
What's going on?

47:31.351 --> 47:34.353
- Want to tell him what you did?
- I'm not talking about it, man.

47:34.437 --> 47:37.565
Can we just focus on getting home, please?

47:45.907 --> 47:48.117
<i>So Ben, John and the third guy</i>

47:48.201 --> 47:51.495
<i>continued their long journey home on foot,</i>

47:51.579 --> 47:54.165
<i>lost, tired and starving.</i>

47:54.249 --> 47:56.876
Hey, how good does, uh, taking a bath

47:56.960 --> 47:58.878
and a big plate of pasta fazool
sound right now?

47:58.962 --> 48:01.005
- Will you shut up, man?
- I'm sorry.

48:01.089 --> 48:02.673
Stranded out here, and I'm starving.

48:02.757 --> 48:03.966
Yeah, so am I, dude.

48:04.050 --> 48:05.760
Of course I want pasta fazool.

48:05.844 --> 48:08.138
- Goddamn it.
- Guys.

48:10.932 --> 48:13.518
My last smoochie.

48:15.812 --> 48:17.229
- Oh, my God.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.

48:17.313 --> 48:18.940
If it is the smoochie you'd like,

48:19.024 --> 48:21.067
confess one sin.

48:30.118 --> 48:31.452
One time, I jerked off
at my grandma's house.

48:31.536 --> 48:34.289
- Bingo. Was she home?
- Yep. I was very ashamed.

48:39.627 --> 48:42.213
- Thank you.
- What about you, Benjamin?

48:42.297 --> 48:44.423
I would love a little bit of smoochie.

48:44.507 --> 48:46.425
That's strange.

48:46.509 --> 48:48.219
Because earlier,

48:48.303 --> 48:50.346
I thought you said
they look like little turds.

48:50.430 --> 48:53.224
And now they're
your favorite fucking food?

48:53.308 --> 48:54.267
Let's not.

48:54.351 --> 48:56.060
I want you to confess that earlier

48:56.144 --> 48:58.187
you were gonna abandon us.

48:58.271 --> 48:59.897
What?

48:59.981 --> 49:01.524
- When? What are you talking about?
- No, I...

49:01.608 --> 49:04.068
Earlier, in the cart, you were
gonna drive away without us.

49:04.152 --> 49:05.403
Are you being serious? Huh?

49:05.487 --> 49:07.571
- You did that?
- It actually happened.

49:07.655 --> 49:09.323
I thought about it for
a second, but in my defense,

49:09.407 --> 49:10.783
I was only thinking about leaving

49:10.867 --> 49:12.076
and having all the treasure to myself.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.577
Everyone's had that thought before,

49:13.661 --> 49:14.912
and I almost acted on it.

49:14.996 --> 49:17.164
I've never had that thought, man. Fuck.

49:17.248 --> 49:18.457
But I didn't. You know why?

49:18.541 --> 49:19.750
Because of the kindness in my heart

49:19.834 --> 49:21.294
and because you saw me.

49:21.378 --> 49:22.837
I wish we didn't come up here
and find the treasure.

49:22.921 --> 49:24.130
- What?
- Whatever. Just give me some,

49:24.214 --> 49:25.590
and then we'll forget all of this.

49:25.674 --> 49:27.758
You know what?
Now nobody gets any smoochie,

49:27.842 --> 49:29.260
- you fucking psycho.
- No!
- No! Mart!

49:29.344 --> 49:31.095
- God, Martin, I'm gonna kill you!
- Guys! Guys!

49:31.179 --> 49:33.431
- Guys! Guys!
- I'm gonna kill you.

49:36.851 --> 49:38.103
Wh-What was that?

50:15.974 --> 50:18.268
What is this place?

50:19.310 --> 50:21.479
Intruders!

50:26.693 --> 50:28.527
- Maybe we should head-head out.
- Yeah, let's...

50:28.611 --> 50:30.279
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

50:30.363 --> 50:32.657
- Sorry.
- A show. Let's stay, then.

50:32.741 --> 50:34.241
Let's stay.

50:34.325 --> 50:36.535
How dare you interrupt our sacred dance.

50:36.619 --> 50:38.287
How dare you!

50:38.371 --> 50:40.164
Shit.

50:40.248 --> 50:42.333
Miles away from civilization,

50:42.417 --> 50:44.669
no cell phone service,

50:44.753 --> 50:46.837
no way to call for help.

50:46.921 --> 50:49.799
Now, tell me, why am I joined today

50:49.883 --> 50:52.468
by you three gorgeous girls?

50:52.552 --> 50:54.553
Oh, us?

50:54.637 --> 50:56.013
- No, no.
- No.

50:56.097 --> 50:57.598
Um, we're guys.

50:57.682 --> 50:59.308
- : Oh. Sorry.
- We're dudes.

50:59.392 --> 51:00.851
It's all right.

51:00.935 --> 51:03.020
Little hard to see out of my new,

51:03.104 --> 51:05.022
awesome ceremonial head.

51:05.106 --> 51:07.191
Regardless...

51:07.275 --> 51:11.696
you've stumbled upon our home,
and it begs the question:

51:11.780 --> 51:15.908
Why are we joined today
by five handsome Black men?

51:15.992 --> 51:18.369
- We're, uh...
- We're-we're, uh...

51:18.453 --> 51:19.870
We're not Black.

51:19.954 --> 51:21.664
- What?
- We're just white.

51:21.748 --> 51:23.249
We're not Black.

51:23.333 --> 51:27.795
Oh, oh, sorry. I can't fucking
see or hear in this thing.

51:27.879 --> 51:29.171
Jesus.

51:29.255 --> 51:31.507
So, what's a Chinese family like...

51:31.591 --> 51:33.509
- Ah, man.
- Stop guessing.
- Damn, dude.

51:33.593 --> 51:35.511
- I think his head is too fucked up.
- Yeah.

51:35.595 --> 51:38.639
God, it's like the most hot
I've ever felt in my whole life.

51:38.723 --> 51:40.141
Just take the fucking head off, man?

51:40.225 --> 51:41.225
Walk normal.

51:41.309 --> 51:42.935
Oh, God, it's too hot!

51:43.019 --> 51:44.270
Tricia!

51:44.354 --> 51:45.896
Okay, Tricia, Tricia.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.565
- Yeah, Deetch.
- I thought we talked about holes in this.

51:47.649 --> 51:49.150
- Yeah, holes in the face?
- Yeah. What the fuck?

51:49.234 --> 51:51.653
I can't keep doing this.

51:52.195 --> 51:53.446
<i>Deetch Nordwind.</i>

51:53.530 --> 51:55.281
<i>The treasure
Deetch was after...</i>

51:55.365 --> 51:56.741
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

51:56.825 --> 52:00.036
Thank you. Love you so much.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.329
Whoa.

52:01.413 --> 52:04.874
Hi. Wow, you look so sad.

52:04.958 --> 52:06.584
Disgusting.

52:06.668 --> 52:08.085
Come on.

52:08.169 --> 52:09.754
Let's change that.

52:12.215 --> 52:14.133
- What are we doing here, man?
- I don't know.

52:14.217 --> 52:16.260
- This is a cult, right?
- It's absolutely a cult.

52:16.344 --> 52:18.179
Dude, I was just out there.
I think this is a cult.

52:18.263 --> 52:19.597
That's what I was just saying.

52:19.681 --> 52:21.223
This sucks, dude.
I hate wearing these clothes.

52:21.307 --> 52:22.558
- I kind of like them.
- Really?

52:22.642 --> 52:24.310
'Cause you look like a bisexual mechanic.

52:24.394 --> 52:26.812
Well, fuck you, man.
You look like a gumdrop farmer.

52:26.896 --> 52:28.272
Who cares how we look?

52:28.356 --> 52:30.066
I haven't had food in 48 hours.

52:30.150 --> 52:31.359
The guy in the head is, like,

52:31.443 --> 52:32.485
the original treasure hunter, right?

52:32.569 --> 52:33.778
- Yeah.
- I mean, this feels like

52:33.862 --> 52:35.154
the worst place we could be.

52:35.238 --> 52:37.114
I know, I know, but that
was like ten years ago.

52:37.198 --> 52:38.366
Okay? I think we're okay.

52:38.450 --> 52:39.909
And the treasure's safe.
I just hid it.

52:39.993 --> 52:40.910
What do you mean? Where?

52:40.994 --> 52:42.286
- What?
- You hid it?

52:42.370 --> 52:44.288
You hid it?
What are you talking about?

52:44.372 --> 52:46.082
We should have eyes on Marge at all times.

52:46.166 --> 52:47.541
You know what?
No, I am not even

52:47.625 --> 52:49.418
entertaining you yelling at me right now.

52:49.502 --> 52:52.046
Martin, you just threw away
your last smoochie.

52:52.130 --> 52:53.589
And, Ben, you almost left us in the woods

52:53.673 --> 52:55.591
so you could take Marge for yourself.

52:55.675 --> 52:57.885
I am in charge.
I am de captain now.

52:57.969 --> 52:58.970
Don't quote <i>Captain Phillips.</i>

52:59.054 --> 53:00.012
Don't do <i>Captain Phillips.</i>

53:00.096 --> 53:01.305
Listen to me.

53:01.389 --> 53:03.140
We're gonna go out there, put a smile on

53:03.224 --> 53:05.602
and eat their food, 'cause we need it.

53:06.561 --> 53:07.728
Okay.

53:12.901 --> 53:14.860
Don't love that.

53:14.944 --> 53:16.153
Thank you so much, everyone,

53:16.237 --> 53:17.571
for occasioning this dinner tonight

53:17.655 --> 53:21.284
to welcome our three new friends.

53:22.202 --> 53:25.913
It's been many years since I sought out

53:25.997 --> 53:27.707
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.834
Over the years,
I've been joined by many

53:29.918 --> 53:32.336
wayward travelers, dreamers,

53:32.420 --> 53:35.339
gym teachers who got too close
to their students.

53:35.423 --> 53:37.008
Guilty.

53:37.092 --> 53:38.968
But, uh, in my defense, she was...

53:39.052 --> 53:40.261
No, no, no.

53:40.345 --> 53:42.555
- We live in harmony...
- What?

53:42.639 --> 53:44.849
...away from the civilized world,

53:44.933 --> 53:47.727
but when we do need to go
on supply runs into town,

53:47.811 --> 53:51.022
we put on our skin masks
to seamlessly blend in.

53:51.106 --> 53:52.898
Jesus Christ.

53:52.982 --> 53:54.191
Holy fucking shit, man.

53:54.275 --> 53:55.401
I feel like that's way more noticeable.

53:55.485 --> 53:56.944
Yeah, definitely.

53:57.028 --> 53:58.863
- No offense. It's okay.
- I'm sorry. You look good.

53:58.947 --> 54:02.950
Most of us came here to find
the treasure of Foggy Mountain.

54:03.034 --> 54:07.538
Eventually, we all realized
we don't need treasure.

54:07.622 --> 54:12.460
All that matters is you, me,
each and every one of us,

54:12.544 --> 54:18.132
which is why we go by
a simple guiding mantra here.

54:18.216 --> 54:19.884
All lives matter.

54:21.678 --> 54:24.555
I'm sorry, did I... did we say
something to offend you or...

54:24.639 --> 54:27.391
When did you guys leave society again?

54:27.475 --> 54:29.185
12 years ago. What? Why?

54:29.269 --> 54:31.354
- Ah.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Now it clicks.

54:31.438 --> 54:33.689
Just, like, now that's very racist.

54:33.773 --> 54:35.232
Racist?

54:35.316 --> 54:37.068
- Well, we're not trying to...
- No, no, I mean, totally...

54:37.152 --> 54:38.361
All lives matter!

54:38.445 --> 54:39.779
I feel like he knows what it means.

54:39.863 --> 54:41.405
- I feel like he knows.
- He definitely knows.

54:41.489 --> 54:42.949
All lives matter.
I got a tattoo of it.

54:43.033 --> 54:44.241
- Ah, shit, dude.
- Oh, my God, dude. It's big.

54:44.325 --> 54:45.576
Nobody else get that.

54:45.660 --> 54:47.620
Regardless, we all know that

54:47.704 --> 54:51.123
no one will ever find that treasure.

54:51.207 --> 54:53.084
But even if I did,

54:53.168 --> 54:57.546
I would take that monument to greed,

54:57.630 --> 55:02.260
and I swear to God I would
destroy it in a big fire

55:02.344 --> 55:04.637
without so much as batting an eye!

55:07.015 --> 55:08.391
Santé!

55:08.475 --> 55:10.685
- Santé!
- Shit.

55:11.895 --> 55:13.980
I wish I didn't hide it next to his chair.

55:14.064 --> 55:16.482
- What'd you say?
- I hid it next to his chair.

55:16.566 --> 55:18.442
On his perch?

55:18.526 --> 55:19.777
Why would you hide it there?

55:19.861 --> 55:21.529
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding me?

55:21.613 --> 55:22.947
You're such a fucking idiot, man.

55:23.031 --> 55:26.368
Deetch, I found some visitors.

55:30.747 --> 55:32.456
You put it under his fucking chair, man?

55:32.540 --> 55:33.791
What was I supposed to do?

55:33.875 --> 55:35.418
Carry around a tote bag all night

55:35.502 --> 55:37.295
like I'm at some fucking farmers market?

55:37.379 --> 55:38.838
The problem was the tote bag?

55:38.922 --> 55:40.464
I'm sorry, okay?

55:40.548 --> 55:42.341
I guess I wasn't thinking
and I just shoved it somewhere.

55:42.425 --> 55:43.968
Well, we got to get it back, all right?

55:44.052 --> 55:45.803
Taylor's probably out there
looking for it right now.

55:45.887 --> 55:48.347
Did you see my three skinny white friends

55:48.431 --> 55:49.974
walking around with a bag?

55:50.058 --> 55:51.225
Yeah, man, well, so is Lisa.

55:51.309 --> 55:52.685
No way. Not Lisa, dude.

55:52.769 --> 55:54.437
She's completely heartbroken right now.

55:54.521 --> 55:57.315
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

55:57.399 --> 55:58.899
Why don't we just go grab it right now?

55:58.983 --> 56:01.486
It's not like Deetch is sitting
on his throne all night.

56:02.737 --> 56:05.489
There's a million people
out there partying, dude!

56:05.573 --> 56:06.949
I can't believe you were so stupid!

56:08.493 --> 56:10.328
- You want to get physical?
- Yeah, maybe I do.

56:10.412 --> 56:12.997
- Hey! Okay.
- What are you doing?

56:13.081 --> 56:14.498
You want to fucking play that game? -

56:14.582 --> 56:16.208
Oh, my God!
Why do you have that?

56:16.292 --> 56:18.377
For self-defense.
I carry a lot of cash.

56:18.461 --> 56:20.338
I can't get approved for a debit card.

56:20.422 --> 56:21.505
Did you say "debit card"?

56:21.589 --> 56:22.840
- Okay.
- What?

56:22.924 --> 56:24.467
You didn't want to whip that thing out

56:24.551 --> 56:25.801
when we were getting punched
in the throat?

56:25.885 --> 56:27.595
You had that completely under control.

56:27.679 --> 56:28.846
- We absolutely did not!
- No, we didn't!

56:28.930 --> 56:30.222
Oh, Marge is driving you guys crazy.

56:30.306 --> 56:31.641
Our relationship is falling apart.

56:31.725 --> 56:34.685
If you don't start acting
like we normally do--

56:34.769 --> 56:38.064
like regular friends, I guess--
you... I'm gonna...

56:41.484 --> 56:43.361
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't do that.

56:43.445 --> 56:44.612
- I don't want to do it.
- John.

56:44.696 --> 56:46.072
- You don't have to do it.
- Oh, my God!

56:46.156 --> 56:47.573
Ow, that hurt so much more
than I thought it would!

56:47.657 --> 56:48.866
Why did you do it?

56:48.950 --> 56:50.117
No other way
I can prove my point.

56:50.201 --> 56:51.494
Yes, there are plenty of ways.

56:51.578 --> 56:53.704
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, dude!

56:53.788 --> 56:55.623
- Ow, ow, ow!
- I can't look at this. Johnny, buddy...

56:55.707 --> 56:57.166
I'm getting woozy, dude.

56:57.250 --> 56:58.918
- Why are you talking like that?
- I'm getting woozy.

56:59.002 --> 57:00.544
What the hell is going on?
John, can we just talk?

57:00.628 --> 57:01.754
- Yeah.
- I feel like maybe you're...

57:01.838 --> 57:04.215
Oh, my God! Why?

57:04.299 --> 57:06.801
- I'm trying to teach you guys a lesson...
- Oh, my God.

57:06.885 --> 57:08.636
...about friendship
and the power of friendship.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.721
Oh, fuck me!

57:10.805 --> 57:12.598
- I'm in middle school!
- What? What?

57:12.682 --> 57:14.517
Y'all remember the good old
days of middle school?

57:14.601 --> 57:16.310
- Middle school?
- Are you having a stroke?

57:16.394 --> 57:17.728
We would hang out like every day, dude.

57:17.812 --> 57:19.480
It was amazing.
Except for those two months

57:19.564 --> 57:20.856
where Ben thought he was
friends with T.J. Scardini.

57:20.940 --> 57:22.441
I was friends with T.J. Scardini.

57:22.525 --> 57:24.527
Uh, you mean you guys carpooled?

57:24.611 --> 57:25.820
Oh, fuck you!

57:25.904 --> 57:27.822
I was just as popular as him!

57:27.906 --> 57:30.157
- As T.J. Scardini?
- Yeah!

57:30.241 --> 57:31.409
Dude was getting his dick sucked

57:31.493 --> 57:32.827
before we even knew it was possible.

57:32.911 --> 57:34.245
Oh, you shut up!

57:34.329 --> 57:35.705
Back up!

57:35.789 --> 57:38.082
- What are you doing?
- Fuck! I like it!

57:38.166 --> 57:39.458
It's starting to feel good!

57:39.542 --> 57:41.127
Man, fuck this!

57:41.211 --> 57:43.087
We got to focus up, all right?
What are we doing?

57:43.171 --> 57:45.673
A-Any second now, they could
find Marge and destroy it.

57:45.757 --> 57:47.967
Maybe they're not wrong
for wanting to do that, okay?

57:48.051 --> 57:50.428
Maybe Deetch is right.
Maybe money isn't everything.

57:50.512 --> 57:51.804
Of course you would say that, man,

57:51.888 --> 57:53.764
'cause you have nothing to spend it on.

57:53.848 --> 57:55.266
Yeah, sorry you don't have shit

57:55.350 --> 57:56.601
waiting for you back home, but we do.

58:01.898 --> 58:04.275
Stop yelling at me like I'm a fucking kid.

58:04.359 --> 58:05.735
I will go and get it.

58:05.819 --> 58:07.278
It's not like they found it.

58:07.362 --> 58:08.946
We found the treasure.

58:09.030 --> 58:10.364
- Oh, my God! What?
- Oh, my God.

58:10.448 --> 58:11.782
It was really easy to find.

58:11.866 --> 58:13.534
- Oh, shit.
- No, no, no. Where is it? Where is it?

58:13.618 --> 58:15.202
- Where is it?
- It's getting prepared for burning.

58:15.286 --> 58:17.121
- Shit, shit, no!
- Oh, my God.

58:17.205 --> 58:18.289
Goddamn it.

58:18.373 --> 58:19.916
So it was you who brought it.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.211
You will be rewarded at
the treasure burning ceremony.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.145
Friends, we've been given a gift--

58:41.229 --> 58:45.816
the symbol of everything
we stand against--

58:45.900 --> 58:49.111
and tonight we destroy
the bust of Marie Antoinette!

58:52.407 --> 58:53.658
Burn!

58:53.742 --> 58:56.077
And it's all thanks
to our new friend, John.

58:56.161 --> 58:58.496
No, no, you don't have to point me out.

58:58.580 --> 58:59.914
- It's okay.
- Friends,

58:59.998 --> 59:03.417
look upon this
ridiculous object and laugh.

59:03.501 --> 59:05.211
Not literally.

59:05.295 --> 59:09.465
To those as enlightened as us,
how much is it even worth?

59:09.549 --> 59:11.384
A hundred million dollars!

59:13.928 --> 59:16.847
<i>A hundred million dollars.</i>

59:16.931 --> 59:18.224
<i>Right.</i>

59:18.308 --> 59:20.851
<i>I guess I haven't thought
of that in a while.</i>

59:20.935 --> 59:24.856
<i>God, it's a lot of money.</i>

59:30.737 --> 59:31.779
Shit's getting heavy, though.

59:31.863 --> 59:33.531
<i>Wait.</i>

59:33.615 --> 59:36.033
<i>Is burning this insane?</i>

59:36.117 --> 59:38.703
Burn it!

59:44.125 --> 59:47.420
♪ Soulja Boy off in this, oh ♪

59:47.504 --> 59:50.673
♪ Watch me crank it, watch me roll ♪

59:50.757 --> 59:53.634
♪ Watch me crank that Soulja Boy ♪

59:53.718 --> 59:57.305
♪ Then Superman that, oh... ♪

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:05.730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:08.399
Johnny Flames.

01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:10.943
Great. Your boyfriend
just lost us a million dollars.

01:00:11.027 --> 01:00:12.653
He probably feels bad.
He probably feels

01:00:12.737 --> 01:00:13.863
- worse than we do.
- Shit, please. Do you realize

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:15.281
I've been doing all this for us?

01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:17.158
No. Stay here with your new
musty-ass friends.

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:18.618
- I'm gone. I'm going home,
and don't you follow me.
- Wait.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.202
Well, fine.

01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:22.913
I'm sick of doing whatever
you want to do anyway, so...

01:00:22.997 --> 01:00:25.666
maybe I'm just gonna stay here
and think for myself

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:28.169
and join this cult.

01:00:29.254 --> 01:00:31.339
Where-where is John?

01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:40.264
How'd you do that, man?
How did you get that?

01:00:40.348 --> 01:00:42.099
It's just mirrors, man.
It's always mirrors.

01:00:42.183 --> 01:00:43.434
Let's go. Go.

01:00:49.482 --> 01:00:50.816
Oh, my God.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.944
I always knew you were
an amazing magician, man.

01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:54.946
Goddamn.

01:00:58.366 --> 01:01:00.827
- What-what are you doing, man?
- What's up?

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.954
I'm staying.

01:01:04.372 --> 01:01:05.665
What?

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.458
I'm staying here, man.

01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:09.043
You guys were right.

01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:11.212
I don't have fucking anything
waiting for me back home.

01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:14.340
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, come on, we-we didn't mean that.

01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:15.675
No, you did mean it.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.968
Dude, it is a hundred million dollars.

01:01:17.052 --> 01:01:18.886
Okay? You can do anything you want now.

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.137
Maybe we don't deserve the treasure.

01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:21.597
- Oh, my God.
- Why do we deserve it?

01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:22.974
We haven't struggled.

01:01:23.058 --> 01:01:24.308
What are you talking about?
I've struggled.

01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:25.434
When have you struggled?

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:26.560
I have anxiety.

01:01:26.644 --> 01:01:27.895
Everybody has anxiety!

01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:29.313
Well, I take pills for it, you asshole!

01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:30.940
Everyone...
everyone takes pills for it.

01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:32.316
No, they don't, man.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.776
You guys don't get it.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.903
Now that we have that money, we're over

01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:37.488
as soon as we leave this mountain,

01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:38.864
and I don't want to deal with that.

01:01:38.948 --> 01:01:40.783
Y-You just don't want to change.

01:01:40.867 --> 01:01:42.660
You just want me to be fucking Lawrence.

01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:44.578
Lawrence was fun as shit.

01:01:44.662 --> 01:01:45.913
I don't love our life, okay?

01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:47.498
I don't want to wake up in a shitty house

01:01:47.582 --> 01:01:48.708
I share with two other people.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.501
And I want to be honest, you guys don't

01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:52.628
- put on enough deodorant.
- What?

01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:54.213
Take that back, man.

01:01:54.297 --> 01:01:55.840
You guys have smelled a little bit bad

01:01:55.924 --> 01:01:57.508
- for as long as I've known you.
- Whatever, Mart.

01:01:57.592 --> 01:01:59.677
You're obsessed with this girl
that you're lying to.

01:01:59.761 --> 01:02:01.762
And you want to have sex
with your own father.

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:03.014
Better than being friends with you.

01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:04.890
I would rather have sex with my dad

01:02:04.974 --> 01:02:07.435
and suck on his nuts
than be friends with you.

01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:09.020
- There you go.
- That sounds bad.

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:10.688
I get that that sounds bad,
and I take that back.

01:02:10.772 --> 01:02:12.064
- All right.
- Maybe you're right.

01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:13.774
Maybe this is just making
all of us unhappy.

01:02:13.858 --> 01:02:15.610
Yeah, no.
That's what I'm saying.

01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:28.873
You guys realize how rare it is
to find great friends?

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:36.256
Asshole.

01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:45.181
<i>So John went back to the cult.</i>

01:02:46.307 --> 01:02:49.560
<i>And Lisa, also lost without her friend,</i>

01:02:49.644 --> 01:02:51.562
<i>stayed, too.</i>

01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:56.150
<i>Ben and Martin made it home
and began searching for someone</i>

01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:59.987
<i>rich and tasteless enough
to buy their treasure.</i>

01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:02.031
<i>With John no longer in their lives,</i>

01:03:02.115 --> 01:03:04.116
<i>they became the versions of themselves</i>

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.828
<i>they always wanted to be.</i>

01:03:20.633 --> 01:03:22.093
What can I get you?

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:24.929
I'll do the sausage plate
with a black coffee

01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:26.931
and a double whiskey, neat.

01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.517
- All right.
- Thanks, darling.

I've been good as shit, man.

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.917
Yeah. Uh, I don't know
if you heard, but next week,

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.253
I am officially taking over Trout Plus.

01:03:57.337 --> 01:03:58.713
Hmm.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.256
Noticed your hair is...

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.925
Jesus style.
They're extensions.

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:04.468
- Yeah. Amy loves it.
- It's cool, man.

01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:07.805

You look like if Reba
was on <i>Undercover Boss.</i>

01:04:10.725 --> 01:04:12.059
So I wouldn't be throwing stones

01:04:12.143 --> 01:04:14.354
from that glass house of yours.

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:16.981
Look, as you know, the sale is tonight,

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.816
so I just wanted to get on the same page

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.484
about some of the financials here.

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:24.072
Oh, my God, Ben.

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:26.490
What the...

01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.784
- Are those the, uh...
- The cult people.

01:04:28.868 --> 01:04:30.786
Okay. Oh, someone saw us.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.079
- Oh, my God.
- Somebody saw...

01:04:32.163 --> 01:04:33.664
- Oh, oh. He's coming over here.
- Oh.

01:04:33.748 --> 01:04:35.124
- Head down, head down, head down.
- Is he still coming?

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:37.919
- He's right there.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:41.589
Oh, he's coming in.
He's coming in.

01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:43.174
- Shoot.
- Ooh.

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:53.184
John?

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:54.310
Aah!

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:56.437
- Hey.
- Crazy running into you.

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:58.397
I was just down here
picking up some gasoline.

01:04:58.481 --> 01:04:59.982
You know how it is.

01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:02.526
You guys look amazing.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:03.861
Thank you. Yeah.

01:05:03.945 --> 01:05:05.404
You, uh... you look...

01:05:05.488 --> 01:05:06.864
Yeah, thanks so much.

01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:09.784
Just living up with the cult:
dancing, Molly.

01:05:09.868 --> 01:05:11.410
It's too much, man.

01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:12.578
It's every day.

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:14.121
You do Molly every day?

01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:16.040
Yeah. It's unsustainable.

01:05:18.293 --> 01:05:20.461
- Are we good?
- Yep, yep.

01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:22.255
- Just be cool.
- You're okay, though?

01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:24.257
Me? No. Yes.

01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.217
- How's Lisa been?
- Doesn't talk to me.

01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:28.094
I don't remember if I was mad at her

01:05:28.178 --> 01:05:31.389
or she was mad at me,
but I kind of missed my window.

01:05:31.473 --> 01:05:33.057
- Have you tried to leave?
- Every time I bring it up,

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:35.726
Deetch, like, mentions my mom's address.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:36.894
It's not a threat or anything.

01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:38.145
I would just imagine that he's saying

01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:39.563
if I left, he'd kill my mom.

01:05:39.647 --> 01:05:40.731
That sounds like a threat.

01:05:40.815 --> 01:05:42.108
That's really scary.

01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:44.110
Hey, did you guys ever, um...

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:46.070
did you guys ever sell Marge?

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.655
It's funny you should ask.

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:49.657
Uh, we're actually selling it
tonight at Trout Plus.

01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:51.284
- Tonight?
- Took us a couple weeks,

01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:53.828
but we found a high-profile buyer.

01:05:53.912 --> 01:05:55.497
That's fucking awesome.

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.460
You got to save me.

01:06:03.004 --> 01:06:04.130
What did you say?

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:05.756
It's just, we're all grown-up.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.466
It's so weird.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.177
You got to save me.

01:06:09.928 --> 01:06:11.095
- Save you?
- Dude.

01:06:11.179 --> 01:06:12.888
They have white chocolate pancakes here?

01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:14.765
Look at those fucking guys outside.

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.267
Oh, my God.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:17.810
- Everybody, be silent.
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:20.938
Guys, I hope you're happy.
I really do.

01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:23.524
I hope life's everything
you wanted it to be.

01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:25.318
Save me if you can.

01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:28.405
I'll see you on the flip.

01:06:29.197 --> 01:06:31.115
Hey, guys! I'm back.

01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:32.783
- Sorry about that.
- Get in the van!

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.410
Ow!

01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:39.290
Do you think he's okay?

01:06:39.374 --> 01:06:41.000
He-he made his choice, okay?

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:42.501
Like, for the first time in our lives,

01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:45.296
we're the perfect versions of ourselves.

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.048
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:47.132 --> 01:06:48.758
See you tonight.

01:06:48.842 --> 01:06:50.468
Sounds good.

01:06:50.552 --> 01:06:52.178
<i>Yes, hold the bike.</i>

01:06:52.262 --> 01:06:53.930
Yes. Good. Great.

01:06:54.014 --> 01:06:55.014
All right, Ben, we're gonna need

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.265
to be a little more sexier.

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:58.559
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Okay, yes.

01:06:58.643 --> 01:06:59.977
My son.

01:07:00.061 --> 01:07:02.188
Face of <i>Grills and Guns</i> magazine.

01:07:02.272 --> 01:07:04.357
Hey, Dylan, tilt up!

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.442
I can see the bags
under his eyes, dumbass!

01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:07.652
Come on!

01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:08.903
- Sorry.
- God.

01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:10.237
What a piece of shit.

01:07:10.321 --> 01:07:11.489
Okay, give me sexier.

01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:12.949
- Yeah, I want something sexy.
- Yeah.

01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:14.659
There it is.

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:16.160
Now let's try one where you feel

01:07:16.244 --> 01:07:18.454
extremely guilty about something.

01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:20.164
Yeah, there we go.

01:07:20.248 --> 01:07:21.499
Did you guys hear that?

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:24.043
Good. We love it. Okay.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.503
That's fine.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.131
Easy, son.
That's a floor model.

01:07:29.215 --> 01:07:30.758
Dad, this isn't me.

01:07:30.842 --> 01:07:32.176
I mean, what am I wearing?

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.512
I look like the CEO
of LongHorn Steakhouse.

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:35.721
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:07:35.805 --> 01:07:37.181
I'll be back for the sale.

01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:40.685
Martin.

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.311
Hey, Martin.

01:07:42.395 --> 01:07:44.438
I was just telling Father
that after the sale tonight

01:07:44.522 --> 01:07:47.233
we'll be able to make a large
donation to the diocese.

01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:49.860
That money will go a long way
in fighting our lawsuits.

01:07:49.944 --> 01:07:51.153
Of course.

01:07:51.237 --> 01:07:53.823
Amy, the salad you made, it's amazing.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:55.157
Oh, thank you.

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:56.534
I also brought dessert.

01:07:56.618 --> 01:07:58.869
My famous smoochies.
I'll be right back.

01:07:58.953 --> 01:07:59.954
Oh, damn, here they come.

01:08:00.038 --> 01:08:01.414
They're so good.

01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:06.085
What are you doing?

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.545
Oh, I'm allergic to walnuts.

01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:08.879
Does Amy not know?

01:08:08.963 --> 01:08:10.298
No, she thinks
I love this salad.

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:11.966
Fuck, you got to start eating these, man.

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.218
Go, go, go! Hurry!

01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:15.595
You got to go faster than I'm going,

01:08:15.679 --> 01:08:17.471
or else the pile just stays the same size.

01:08:17.555 --> 01:08:21.350
I love Amy, but I am in a hell
of my own making.

01:08:21.434 --> 01:08:23.603
- Do you guys hear a motorcycle?
- Oh, my God.

01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:25.813
Alert the press.
This church is close to a road.

01:08:27.732 --> 01:08:29.525
Don't laugh.
You're not my friend.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:30.985
Martin!

01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:35.281
Let's go save our friend.

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:40.786
- What's going on?
- Baby, I'm sorry.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:42.496
I'll see you at the sale.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.916
Now, let's get some haircuts.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.418
What...

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.670
Oh, by the way, your weird
friend ate all my walnuts.

01:08:49.754 --> 01:08:51.797
I tried to stop him.
I don't know what...

01:08:57.178 --> 01:08:58.846
Test. Testing.

01:09:01.307 --> 01:09:03.726
Why am I the one
that has to fix this head?

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:06.270
Um, just came to get my
flower crown. Have you seen it?

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:08.105
You're looking right at it.

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:10.483
Oh, didn't know that one was mine.

01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:14.070
Can we just talk to each other, please?

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:15.446
We could've been talking.

01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:17.073
We could've been hanging out every day.

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:18.282
But whatever.

01:09:18.366 --> 01:09:19.659
I'm gonna go see my new friends.

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:21.369
Of course they love you.
You do whatever they say.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.787
'Cause you're a follower.

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:24.121
Well, no one likes you,

01:09:24.205 --> 01:09:25.707
because you're a bad friend.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.461
Me being a bad friend--
that's rich.

01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:31.963
If I'm such a bad friend...

01:09:32.047 --> 01:09:34.674
why would I set up a magic trick

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:37.051
to steal the treasure back from Deetch

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.970
and give it to my friends?

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:40.638
And tonight, they're selling it

01:09:40.722 --> 01:09:44.809
for $110 million
at Trout Plus on Abercorn.

01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:46.978
Not the one that's on Mumford.

01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:49.063
- The one that's on Abercorn.
- Okay.

01:09:49.147 --> 01:09:52.233
God, it's just nice to talk, you know?

01:09:53.026 --> 01:09:55.361
No skin masks, no disguises.

01:09:55.445 --> 01:09:57.655
Tonight, we show the world
exactly who we are.

01:09:57.739 --> 01:09:59.407
Deetch, you don't have to do this.

01:09:59.491 --> 01:10:01.618
What would you get out of destroying it?

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:07.081
It's a hundred million dollars.

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:10.501
I'm not gonna destroy it,
you stupid bitch.

01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:12.169
- You are insane.
- Am I?

01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:14.505
What would you have done with the money?

01:10:14.589 --> 01:10:16.507
I would've gone to London
with my two best friends.

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:20.344
You don't need a hundred
million dollars to do that.

01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:23.014
Your friends just don't want
to go with you.

01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:25.808
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't.

01:10:25.892 --> 01:10:29.353
No!
There might be a bug in here!

01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:31.689
Gun it, Lisa.

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:33.274
Lisa, don't go down with him.

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:35.067
He's a liar!
He wants to keep it!

01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:37.612
I'm sorry, Lisa!

01:10:43.743 --> 01:10:46.496
- Here we come, Johnny boy!
- Here we come, man!

01:10:53.586 --> 01:10:56.255
Okay. Where's Ben?

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:57.798
Buyer's almost here.

01:10:57.882 --> 01:11:00.885
Hey, and why are the
hors d'oeuvres not here yet?

01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.845
And who the hell are you?

01:11:02.929 --> 01:11:04.138
I'm the appraiser.

01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:05.640
The buyer sent me in from Sotheby's.

01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:08.392
Yeah, well, your weird face
is ruining the vibe.

01:11:08.476 --> 01:11:09.769
I'm trying to set a mood.

01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:11.145
This is a big deal.

01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:12.772
This guy's an A-lister.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.150
Oh, my God!

01:11:16.234 --> 01:11:18.194
That's him! He's here! Mwah!

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:20.363
Everybody, the buyer's here!

01:11:20.447 --> 01:11:22.990
Come on! Dylan, vacuum!

01:11:23.074 --> 01:11:24.909
Get it out! Get it out now! Go!

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:26.077
Everybody on the line!

01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:27.703
This is the real thing!

01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:31.666
♪ I'm so fly, I can't lie ♪

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.834

01:11:33.918 --> 01:11:36.295

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.923
Is that Dustin from <i>Stranger Things?</i>

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.132
Yes, it is.

01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:41.634
Gaten Matarazzo...

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:43.261
- welcome to my store.
- Yeah, well, you can

01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:44.262
just call me that pretty motherfucker

01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:45.388
from <i>Stranger Things.</i>

01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:46.931

They found out about the treasure.

How did he find out?

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.177

Okay. Lisa, stay here.
Take the back entrance.

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:38.357
Make sure no one leaves.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:40.318

Oh, oh, my God.

01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:07.637

that belongs to me.

Oh, no!

01:13:21.276 --> 01:13:22.485
Where are we going, John?

01:13:22.569 --> 01:13:24.403
There's no way we're gonna
make it in time.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:26.740
There's one way.

01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:32.119
John, what are we doing here?

01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:40.086
Dude, you gonna fly down?

01:13:41.463 --> 01:13:42.838
That's Trout Plus.

01:13:42.922 --> 01:13:45.216
This is the only way
we'll make it in time.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.385
No, John, we did this once, man.

01:13:47.469 --> 01:13:49.553
I don't know if you remember--
I became a kite.

01:13:49.637 --> 01:13:51.055
You guys, we got to get Marge back.

that you guys love.

Mart, I've been a dick
to your girlfriend, man.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.064
If I'm being honest, I don't
know her last name even.

01:14:00.148 --> 01:14:01.065
It's Murphy.

01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:02.149
- Murphy.
- Murphy.

01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:03.276
That's beautiful.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.694
- Thank you.
- And, Benny,

01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:06.404
I feel like a big part of the reason why

01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:08.239
you and your dad have a weird relationship

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:10.658
is 'cause I write Yelp reviews
complaining about you,

01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:13.577
hoping Farley sees them and fires you.

01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:15.371
- What?
- Yeah, dude.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:16.622
- Why?
- Because I wanted him

01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:18.249
to get fired so we could go, like,

01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:19.417
bowling more or some stupid shit.

01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:20.668
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:22.086
I don't know, man.
I'm fucked-up.

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.589
When I was a kid,
you guys were there for me.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:27.008
I wasn't Penis Boy to you guys.
I was just John.

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:29.719
And I've been an asshole,
but I can change.

01:14:29.803 --> 01:14:31.387
I'll get to know Amy Miller.

01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:32.513
I just said Murphy, John.

01:14:32.597 --> 01:14:33.889
- Murphy, Murphy.
- Murphy, dude.

01:14:33.973 --> 01:14:35.391
- I'd appreciate it if...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:37.852
I can't hold you guys back anymore.

01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:40.188
