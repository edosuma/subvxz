00:06.006 --> 00:08.591
<i>Previously on</i> Justified City Primeval...

00:08.591 --> 00:10.510
Come on, Dad.
I don't wanna do this.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.929
- You broke her nose.
- She deserved it.

00:12.929 --> 00:13.972
<i>Clement Mansell.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:15.932
How'd he get off
the Wrecking Crew killings?

00:16.975 --> 00:18.059
Fuck.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.811
Listen, I'm gonna
need you to get me a lawyer.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.021
<i>My name
is Carolyn Wilder.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:22.439
<i>I'm a friend
of Marcus Sweeton's,</i>

00:22.439 --> 00:23.481
and I'm gonna be your lawyer.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.066
Today must be my lucky day.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.568
I've seen some shit--

00:26.568 --> 00:28.611
<i>things you and your bosses</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:29.988
<i>don't want to come to light.</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:31.489
<i>There's that woman
from court.</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:33.450
- What'd you do?
- You bought her a drink.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.326
<i>Then unless
you really have something</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:37.579
on my client,
then walk away, Marshal.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.330
I need you to do me
a little favor.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.373
<i>Sandy's dead.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:41.833
You think she was there
to toss a gun.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.085
<i>Job's the reason
we got the Albanian mark</i>

00:44.085 --> 00:45.253
and the penthouse crash pad.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.337
<i>You are a tough man</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:47.464
<i>to track down, Raylan.</i>

00:47.464 --> 00:48.715
You know, you did a great job.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.133
She's very sweet.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.471
I see you
near my daughter again,

00:54.471 --> 00:55.722
and I'll kill you.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.419
Hey, Jamal.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.005
I'm sitting here
looking at a lien

01:29.005 --> 01:31.591
from the goddamn IRS.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
This is your mess,

01:38.807 --> 01:40.350
not mine.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.559
Fix it.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.593
My neighbors are sleeping.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.222
Well, what do you think?

02:21.599 --> 02:23.476
I said turn it off.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.229
Huh?
Turn it off!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.939
Right.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.318
Well, don't you wanna know
who did it?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.361
No.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.822
Not interested.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.575
Our friend the marshal.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.161
Well, you can tell me about it

02:41.161 --> 02:43.329
at my office tomorrow morning.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.081
He chatted up my girl Sandy,

02:45.081 --> 02:48.084
and I just paid
a little visit to his hotel

02:48.084 --> 02:50.628
and then chatted up his.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.255
His gir--
do you mean his daughter?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.590
All I did was say hi

02:53.590 --> 02:55.133
and get her
some chicken fingers,

02:55.133 --> 02:56.384
which she enjoyed,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.178
and I want you to look
what he did to me.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.679
Maybe you deserved it.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.306
I've been assaulted.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.603
Probably smart we take pictures
of the evidence.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.938
Better light inside.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.281
Don't you put that out
on my yard.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.866
You stay away
from that marshal,

03:19.866 --> 03:21.159
you stay away
from his daughter,

03:21.159 --> 03:23.244
and you stay away
from my house.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.626
Messing with
a U.S. marshal's daughter...

03:31.628 --> 03:33.630
I don't know
what you think you're doing.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.966
What am I doing?

03:39.969 --> 03:42.764
Whatever I want.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.125
How is she?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.544
Ask her.
She ain't talkin' to me.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.672
You didn't take the bait?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.966
I might've left
some marks visible.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.009
Makes this an easy one--

04:20.009 --> 04:23.054
black bag in a cornfield,
problem solved.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.389
We like him for the judge.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.849
Come on, Maureen.
If that was your kids, huh?

04:26.849 --> 04:28.476
- Your girls?
- Everybody from police brass

04:28.476 --> 04:29.644
to Action News 7
wanna know why,

04:29.644 --> 04:31.145
36 hours later, we got nothing.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.480
Sorry if I wanna do
police work.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.232
I think she wants a photo op.
Blow me.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.358
We thump him and send him up,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.609
that's a kill-two-birds
kind of deal.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.027
Hey, look,
he take him, may as well

04:38.027 --> 04:39.487
put a hurt on Sweety
and the girl too.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.613
How about the Albanian kid?

04:40.613 --> 04:41.656
Detour.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.032
What do you say, slim?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.286
Your town, your call.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.537
Is it, though?

04:47.537 --> 04:48.788
Hey, two of you need anything--

04:48.788 --> 04:51.165
place to stay, a hot meal--
say the word.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.208
Thank you.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.376
Yo, Raylan, ride with me.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.877
Maybe we find a tall building,

04:54.877 --> 04:56.629
see if he can fly.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.557
Where are we going?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.058
Marshal's office.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.310
Then where?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.561
Right now is my concern.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.313
What about tonight?
Where then?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.731
I'm not
gettin' into that now.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.941
"Now." You keep saying "now."

05:16.941 --> 05:18.192
What's the deal, Dad?

05:18.192 --> 05:19.444
You got a plan
you won't tell me,

05:19.569 --> 05:20.945
or are you making this up
as you go?

05:20.945 --> 05:23.531
Willa,
what do you want from me?

05:23.531 --> 05:25.199
I'd like to eat--

05:25.199 --> 05:28.411
not a Coke, not a package
of nuts out of the machine--

05:28.411 --> 05:30.621
breakfast with my dad.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.583
Willa--
Rollin' out.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.514
What can I get ya?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.600
Scrambled eggs,
toast, cup of coffee.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.769
Tea with lemon, please.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.314
I thought you wanted to eat.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.107
I will.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.567
So...

05:59.567 --> 06:00.818
tell me.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.071
- All that activity back there...
- Mm.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.323
You must've fucked up
pretty bad.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.450
What?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.243
It's a word.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.080
People use words
to communicate.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.706
You should try some.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.626
All right.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.878
So you're mad.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.757
Mad?
Mm-hmm.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.968
No.
I'm in the Green Zone.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.263
You know,
the social-emotional chart?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.765
Probably didn't
teach that to you

06:30.765 --> 06:32.767
in Harlan public schools
a million years ago.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.477
- Mm.
- Blue is sad.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.937
All these kids today
with their little labels.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.063
Green is, kind of,
like, steady.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.272
- Yellow--
- And you're mad

06:38.272 --> 06:40.525
'cause you saw me
in the Red Zone.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.735
Well, he's a killer, Willa,

06:42.735 --> 06:44.487
and he enjoys it.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.988
Do you understand that?

06:48.199 --> 06:50.326
There you go again,
saying I'm mad.

you're under arrest.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.899
You have the right

Anything you say can and will

and want one,

the courts will appoint one

07:30.283 --> 07:32.452
You understand these rights?
I'm not gonna lie.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.995

07:33.995 --> 07:36.247

Well...

08:18.915 --> 08:20.249
You certainly didn't help

08:20.249 --> 08:23.085
with that little stunt
last night.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.962
I wish you'd just say it.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.800
What are we
talking about now?

08:29.800 --> 08:32.094
I got in the way,
and you got in trouble,

08:32.094 --> 08:34.597
and it would've been so much
easier if I weren't around.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.902
It's hard, Willa.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.278

08:50.655 --> 08:53.115
You do whatever you want.

You're my life.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.868
But am I?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.119
Like, am I even in it?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.163
To even hear you say that...

08:59.163 --> 09:02.124
How do you think
it feels to ask?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.889
I'll do better.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.809
I'll do better.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.104
All right?

09:24.313 --> 09:26.315
I'm gonna hold you to that.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.484
You better not
go backstabbing me.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.445
Yeah, or what?

09:33.656 --> 09:36.909
Why do you think
I broke that bitch's nose?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.044
They had you cold

09:47.044 --> 09:49.880
on four counts
of second-degree homicide,

09:49.880 --> 09:51.340
but you walked.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.508
That's impressive.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.176
You blew town
for a couple years

09:54.176 --> 09:56.178
to hide out
in the Redneck Riviera

09:56.178 --> 09:57.847
or--I don't know--
wherever the fuck

09:57.847 --> 09:59.932
a guy like you
thinks is paradise.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.518
But then you come back

10:02.518 --> 10:04.562
and you say,
"I know what I'll do.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.355
"I'll do a judge and a girl,

10:06.355 --> 10:08.024
<i>and then
I'll go after a marshal,"</i>

10:08.024 --> 10:11.277
<i>and I'm trying to answer
the question, "Why?"</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:12.862
<i>And the only thing
I can deduce</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:14.947
is that you are not

10:14.947 --> 10:16.699
what we in the trade call

10:16.699 --> 10:18.701
a criminal mastermind.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.453
<i>Motherfucker,
I got an eyewitness</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:21.871
<i>that ties you to the judge.</i>

10:21.871 --> 10:24.707
<i>With your sheet, you're
lookin' at life in Baraga.</i>

10:27.960 --> 10:30.379
You realize...

10:30.379 --> 10:32.715
that square beard
doesn't make up

10:32.715 --> 10:36.260
for a nice full head of hair.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.890
18 years on the job,
Ms. Stanton,

10:40.890 --> 10:42.183
murder police for 10.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.185
I've seen that look
plenty of times before,

10:44.185 --> 10:47.104
that squeezed-to-death look.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.399
Had it
leaving Del Weems' place,

10:50.399 --> 10:53.235
had it standing at the rail
of the bridge over the Rouge,

10:53.235 --> 10:55.446
and you had it when you went
into Sweety's Tavern...

10:58.240 --> 10:59.992
But not when you came out.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.577
<i>You've been
someone we can turn to</i>

11:01.577 --> 11:04.080
a long time now,
understand the street.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
You don't snitch,
fair enough.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.167
But you got your eyes
on the city, the community,

11:08.167 --> 11:11.003
and your tranquil patch therein.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.925
You, um,
singing my funeral song?

11:15.925 --> 11:18.886
You're in the hot seat on
a press case double homicide.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.221
Maybe I am.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.015
Maybe.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.767
<i>You don't wanna talk, fine.</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:26.102
We got Sandy in the next room,

11:26.102 --> 11:29.230
and she is just
spilling her guts.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.232
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I not mention that?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.441
I think
I also forgot to mention

11:32.441 --> 11:34.026
that we've been
tailin' her ass--

11:34.026 --> 11:35.277
when she stopped
at that bridge,

11:35.277 --> 11:37.113
when she stopped
at Sweety's Tavern,

11:37.113 --> 11:39.407
presumably at your behest.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
<i>Oh...</i>

11:40.741 --> 11:42.910
<i>he's here too, by the way.</i>

11:42.910 --> 11:44.787
We found the murder gun,

11:44.787 --> 11:46.330
the one you hid there,
Ms. Stanton.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.373
Isn't that right?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.416
Isn't that why you looked

11:48.416 --> 11:50.584
so calm and collected
coming out?

11:55.339 --> 11:57.800
Sandy Stanton,
next room over,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.468
just gave us the gun.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.971
Hear me?

12:03.472 --> 12:05.474
We got you cold.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.397
I wanna see my lawyer.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.650
<i>Okay, partner.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:17.528
I guess there's no point
in letting them tell it all.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.866
<i>Can you just
do me a favor and...</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:23.409
<i>can you get me
a tape recorder?</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:26.328
<i>I got you covered, pal.</i>

12:28.664 --> 12:30.666
<i>Yeah, but it's not the same.</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:35.337
Lucky me.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.840
It only took me
six rooms to find it.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.091
Now talk.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.182
<i>I do appreciate the effort.</i>

12:59.820 --> 13:01.363
<i>♪ Fall is here ♪</i>

Got up and sang?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.814
Oh, that's a new one.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.315
Like he knew I was there.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.900
You know,
I knew what to expect

13:37.900 --> 13:39.235
when I put you on this...

13:39.235 --> 13:40.736
Understood--
no more surprises.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.405
But you stay on this road,
you're gonna get indicted,

13:43.572 --> 13:44.865
and then I'm gonna miss
getting this guy.

13:44.865 --> 13:45.908
Then send me home, Lou.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.203
As the LEO who assaulted
instead of arraigned a suspect?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.329
Then keep me here.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.753
Did you like the drink
he sent you at the bar?

13:57.753 --> 14:00.381
Oh...

14:00.381 --> 14:02.258
that was you.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.136
The sparkler was a nice touch.
Thank you.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.558
He's not bad for a white guy.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.934
Leave her out of this, please.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.352
We're just talking.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.854
Give us a minute, Willa.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.230
And stay put.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.190
Nice to see you again.
You too.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.195
You need to get
your client under control.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.738
Excuse me?

14:24.738 --> 14:25.906
I steered clear,

14:25.906 --> 14:27.241
but there are
goddamn boundaries.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.367
He crossed a line.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.452
You put your hands on him.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.495
Not arguing I didn't.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.664
I should not have to tell you
why that's not okay.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.249
Clement Mansell

14:35.249 --> 14:37.251
ain't some misguided boy,

14:37.251 --> 14:38.669
someone to defend,

14:38.669 --> 14:41.046
- feel sorry for--
- I told you to stay away,

14:41.046 --> 14:42.464
- but no.
- He killed the judge

14:42.464 --> 14:43.632
and Rose Doyle.
Don't ever

14:43.632 --> 14:46.010
do that to me again.
We know he did.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.636
Then prove it!

14:47.636 --> 14:48.846
Get him--

14:48.846 --> 14:51.223
the right way.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.266
Look, look, look.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.934
I know that's your kid.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.477
You're angry.
I get it.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.937
I'd be angry too,

14:56.937 --> 14:58.814
but everybody
doesn't get to be angry

14:58.814 --> 15:00.608
the way you do.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.665
I appreciate the meal, Bill.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.876
And I appreciate you
opening your home.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.836
You're safer here than you
are at some hotel downtown.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.588
Yeah, I'd like
to see that guy try it.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.673
Huh? Huh, tough guy?

15:24.673 --> 15:26.091
Still, the risk ain't zero.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.343
I thank you both.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.012
Ah, it's all good, brother.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.097
You sure I can't dry
or something?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.682
Nah, you just chill.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.827
How about you show Willa
your room?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.245
What's Florida like?

15:55.245 --> 15:56.538
It's pretty nice.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.998
It's never cold.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.875
We have palm trees
and alligators.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.753
I have friends with alligators
in their backyards.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.816
Brought you an extra pillow.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.116
I know what you're thinking.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.412
What does Mansell
have to do with Judge Guy?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.039
Never came
through his courtroom.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.499
Never crossed paths
with Rose either.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.917
Played bumper cars
with the judge

16:41.917 --> 16:44.128
while his old lady's out
with some Armenian kid?

16:44.128 --> 16:45.170
- Albanian.
- Right.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.422
But he doesn't go after him.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.674
- He's not jealous.
- He's too neat.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.300
Kid figures in somehow.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.471
Look at the marshal
doing cop work.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.768
She's welcome to stay
as long as she wants.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.853
You too.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.990
Go on.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.076
I know you sittin' on them words
like a mother hen.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.578
I'm not sittin' on nothin'.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.540
I'm sweeping up
the shame of it all.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.796
That what I'm supposed
to be feelin'?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.965
That's what I'm feelin'.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.884
It's a shame,

17:31.884 --> 17:32.926
a waste.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.928
It's not how it had to be.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.430
But I guess it's how it is.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.729
You know,
I lived a long time...

17:43.729 --> 17:46.148
in this place...

17:46.148 --> 17:47.524
in this town.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.028
I can't go back now.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.031
And I won't.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.452
Guess I'll go on
sweeping, then.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.579
Don't have to do
one thing you don't want.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.000
Not one thing.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.135
Scuse me?

18:15.135 --> 18:16.804
Uh...

18:16.804 --> 18:19.014
did you stop at an antique shop
on the way back?

18:19.014 --> 18:20.724
It's Mansell's.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.976
Thought he was slick,
stashing it here.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.606
Get rid of it.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.025
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.322
Let him think
he got an ace in the hole.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.828
See the look on his face...

18:40.828 --> 18:43.413
when he get got.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.432
<i>♪ I can't reach you at all ♪</i>

19:02.432 --> 19:04.351
<i>♪ I can't hurt you ♪</i>

19:04.351 --> 19:07.688
Ooh, look at Suzy Homemaker.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.356
You needed your rest.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.066
You know, I did.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.443
I am feeling a bit refreshed.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.239
Time to get back on track, baby.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.868
My little Albanian?

19:20.868 --> 19:23.495
Can't you just picture it?

19:23.495 --> 19:26.373
Salt water...

19:26.373 --> 19:29.084
cocktails,
and steamy jungles.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.586
Cut it out.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.504
<i>♪ You can't see me ♪</i>

19:32.504 --> 19:35.716
I ain't gonna do it

19:35.716 --> 19:37.509
Baby, we don't have to kiss.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.430
- Uh-uh.
- Come on.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.849
I'm hungry, you know,

19:43.849 --> 19:46.476
from cleaning
the whole place myself.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.229
Hey, Sandy, uh,

19:49.229 --> 19:51.023
what'd you do
with that gun again?

19:53.066 --> 19:55.194
I told you.
I put it in the river.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.655
Hmm.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.368
So...

20:03.368 --> 20:06.955
what the hell
is an Albanian anyway?

20:06.955 --> 20:09.291
You know how Italy sticks down?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.418
Albania's
on the other side of it.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.878
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.962
Use the microwave.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.757
- It'll be soft.
- Do it over the burner, then.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.843
It's a bagel toaster.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.969
Mm.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.431
O...

20:24.431 --> 20:25.641
kay.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.145
Anyway, the Albanians
that live here

20:30.145 --> 20:31.813
are mostly
the really hard-ass ones

20:31.813 --> 20:33.482
who wouldn't live
under the Turks

20:33.482 --> 20:35.192
or Communists or somebody.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.069
What the hell's
so hard-ass about 'em?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.154
Well, like Skender says,

20:39.154 --> 20:40.739
if you do something
to his brother,

20:40.739 --> 20:42.658
you're doing it to him.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.953
Like,
husband beats up his wife.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.746
She goes home, tells her dad.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.414
Her dad goes looking
for the son-in-law,

20:49.414 --> 20:50.832
- shoots him...
- Oh, is that right?

20:50.832 --> 20:52.751
And then the brother of
the son-in-law shoots the dad,

20:52.751 --> 20:54.795
and then the dad's son,
the brother of the guy's wife,

20:54.795 --> 20:56.421
shoots the brother
of the husband.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.923
And sometimes they have
to get somebody over

20:57.923 --> 20:59.675
from Yugoslavia
to come and settle it.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.969
It gets so mixed up with
everybody shooting each other.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.805
Jesus, where the hell are we,
Detroit or east Tennessee?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.724
Skender said they built
this secret room he's got.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.352
In case they get into
one of their "blood feuds,"

21:10.352 --> 21:12.229
they got somewhere to hide out.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.066
Secret room?

23:11.014 --> 23:12.140
<i>Hey, bro,</i>

23:12.140 --> 23:13.517
<i>when I say "polish the floor,"</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:16.144
I mean polish the floor.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.441
Hey!
Welcome to Tirana Dog.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.276
Skender "Lullgarage"?

23:24.528 --> 23:26.488
Is "Lul-your-eye."

23:26.488 --> 23:29.491
Skender Lulgjuraj.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.997
You police?

23:35.997 --> 23:37.999
Got a question for ya.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.001
I was once standing
behind an individual,

23:40.001 --> 23:41.503
ordered a hot dog sandwich.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.921
Is it a sandwich?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.256
Bro.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.299
Next question:
what's your relationship

23:46.299 --> 23:47.509
with Sandy Stanton?

23:47.509 --> 23:49.845
I already
told you guys before,

23:49.845 --> 23:51.596
I don't wanna
talk about her.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.056
But you were
with her at the night

23:53.056 --> 23:54.349
Judge Guy was killed?

23:54.349 --> 23:55.767
Sandy's done nothing wrong.

23:55.767 --> 23:56.852
Why are you protecting her?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.146
You two a team?

23:59.146 --> 24:00.439
Team?

24:00.439 --> 24:04.609
We are apple cut in half.
Hmm?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.864
Look, I come here,

24:08.864 --> 24:11.032
this country, this city,

24:11.032 --> 24:16.079
I expect life is PlayStation
and <i>MTV Cribs</i> and big butts,

24:16.079 --> 24:18.248
and then...

24:18.248 --> 24:20.667
I meet Sandy,

24:20.667 --> 24:23.753
and I see there is more,
you know?

24:23.753 --> 24:25.422
There is, um...

24:28.008 --> 24:29.718
It is embarrassing, bro.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.304
Ah.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.055
The ring I buy for this,

24:34.055 --> 24:36.600
$27,000.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.270
You're marrying
Sandy Stanton?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.856
Uh, TBD.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.983
Sandy's very close
with her brother.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.403
Apparently he wants
to meet me first, so...

24:48.403 --> 24:50.071
I say, "Fine."

24:51.198 --> 24:52.741
I get it.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.159
Family.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.537
Hot dog sandwich.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.003
<i>What's up, Raylan?</i>

25:05.003 --> 25:07.672
He's loaded, he's in love,
and he ain't so bright.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.342
Doesn't sound like
somebody in on the grift.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.552
Sounds like he's the mark.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.273
<i>♪ Or give me
just a little sigh ♪</i>

25:25.273 --> 25:28.151
Uh, it's, uh,
pretty loud in here, bro.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.404
Well, if Mama hadn't been
carried off by a tornado,

25:31.404 --> 25:34.115
we'd be holding
this meeting in Lawton.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.244
He means Lawton, Oklahoma.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.079
Tornado?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.206
How have you
never told me this?

25:41.206 --> 25:43.458
It was a day like any other,

25:43.458 --> 25:45.710
Mama slaving away.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.295
<i>Poor old gal.</i>

25:47.295 --> 25:49.297
<i>She was hanging wash
on the line,</i>

25:49.297 --> 25:51.800
<i>had a pot on the stove inside.</i>

25:51.800 --> 25:54.219
<i>Then the wind picked up.</i>

25:54.219 --> 25:56.471
<i>Sky turned dark,</i>

25:56.471 --> 25:58.557
<i>angry, ugly.</i>

26:11.903 --> 26:14.614
Next thing we know,

26:14.614 --> 26:17.784
she was above
the fruited plain,

26:17.784 --> 26:19.995
teams of hounds
out hunting for her

26:19.995 --> 26:21.830
five counties over.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.125
Never found a trace.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.840
Hey, you're pulling my shit!

26:35.510 --> 26:37.137
Trust me, brother.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.180
I'll never pull your shit.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.683
He's not pulling your shit.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.226
So...

26:43.226 --> 26:46.479
young stud like you,
good looks,

26:46.479 --> 26:48.690
big business,

26:48.690 --> 26:50.358
hung like a nine-pound hammer.

26:51.651 --> 26:55.030
I mean, why you wanna
tie the knot?

26:55.030 --> 26:58.199
Ain't domestic life gonna
drag a guy like you down?

26:59.826 --> 27:02.120
Who do I explain this?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.747
You just know.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.790
And I tell you, your concern?

27:05.790 --> 27:09.628
Trust me,
when Sandy becomes Lulgjaraj,

27:09.628 --> 27:11.671
she becomes family.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.381
She will never,

27:13.381 --> 27:16.468
ever feel hunger or pain.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.720
That is quite a promise.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.472
I mean,
I don't mean to get personal,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.891
but I gotta look out
for sis here, you know...

27:22.891 --> 27:24.601
Or Mama comes

27:24.601 --> 27:26.227
storming back
from wherever she's at

27:26.227 --> 27:28.229
and give me the dickens.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.273
You're a good brother to her.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.900
You look out for family.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.026
SANDY.
Mm.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.861
So...

27:34.861 --> 27:38.948
all this money you got
from your hot dog dynasty,

27:38.948 --> 27:43.078
how do you keep
from getting taxed to death?

27:43.078 --> 27:44.412
Cash?

27:46.039 --> 27:48.416
Ah, sure, yes.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.254
I bet you got gold bars

27:53.254 --> 27:55.757
or something
in that room of yours.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.511
Oh, yeah.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.346
Ain't no secrets
in this family.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.808
Gold bars.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.226
Is not like that, bro.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.268
No?

28:08.937 --> 28:11.314
Oh, what's it like, then?

28:11.314 --> 28:15.110
I mean, fuckin' leaf
hits the roof, I'm awake.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.528
I've tried everything.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.947
Got a hamster
on a fuckin' wheel in my brain.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.281
Prick runs all night.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.660
And when I do sleep,
I have crazy dreams--

28:23.660 --> 28:25.078
I mean, sick shit.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.538
I don't remember any details
when I wake up,

28:26.663 --> 28:28.123
but when I have
lame-ass bullshit,

28:28.123 --> 28:30.166
that, I remember
like I'm looking at a picture.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.169
Hit me.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.340
Uh-huh.

28:37.465 --> 28:38.675
All right,
one I had just last week.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.926
I'm at a fancy dinner,

28:39.926 --> 28:42.095
not with Bill
but with some random hunk.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.763
You know, Magic Mike, right?

28:43.763 --> 28:45.014
Nobody I even know.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.475
And, uh, the guy's giving me
this look, right?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.811
You know the look--
"Let's fuck."

28:49.811 --> 28:52.564
And then my girls
show up with guns,

28:52.564 --> 28:54.482
and they're like,
"No, Mom, don't, please!

28:54.482 --> 28:56.776
Don't! No, we need you!"

28:56.776 --> 28:59.946
Next thing I know,
Magic Mike is just fucking Bill,

29:00.071 --> 29:01.656
and I wake up,
and I'm lying next to him,

29:01.656 --> 29:03.616
and his goddamn
sleep apnea thing fell off,

29:03.616 --> 29:05.577
and his fuckin' snoring
is what woke me up.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.127
You know you swear a lot?

29:14.127 --> 29:16.504
That's your takeaway,
Dr. Freud?

29:16.504 --> 29:17.839
My takeaway is,
it seemed to me

29:17.839 --> 29:19.591
like you were all
pretty happy back there.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.510
In fact,
I was honestly wondering

29:22.510 --> 29:23.845
how you did it--

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
the job, domestic bliss.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.308
Oh, that's easy--

29:28.308 --> 29:29.392
pretend.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.773
So what's the deal?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.066
Uh, Mansell, Stanton,
and the Albanian kid

29:37.066 --> 29:38.151
have been inside
nearly an hour.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.319
Should be wrapping up.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.029
We'll circle back
in a couple hours.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.990
Anything interesting happens,
you have my cell.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.617
Good luck
with that other thing--

29:45.617 --> 29:47.452
you know, with your kid.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.959
I got a hypothetical
I'd like you to assess.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.551
I might have a murder weapon.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.722
A gun that murdered a judge

30:07.722 --> 30:09.432
and might've taken out

30:09.432 --> 30:12.143
three brothers
and two peckerwoods

30:12.143 --> 30:14.187
in the Wrecking Crew killings.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.357
Now, if this gun

30:17.357 --> 30:19.901
were to show itself...

30:21.486 --> 30:24.197
Where does that leave me?

30:27.116 --> 30:29.202
You talkin' to me
like I'm just your lawyer,

30:29.202 --> 30:31.913
like I didn't do my homework
sitting on your barstool.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.374
So I mean...

30:34.374 --> 30:36.042
You got a take
on this situation or what?

30:36.042 --> 30:38.336
I'm sayin' help me.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.712
Help yourself.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.756
Turn it in.

30:41.756 --> 30:44.384
You know, let's get this cracker
off our backs for good.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.054
And I go to prison.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.472
No, I wouldn't
let that happen.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.934
I could talk
to this sister I know

30:52.934 --> 30:55.353
in the prosecutor's office,

30:55.353 --> 30:57.355
see if she'll
guarantee immunity.

31:01.734 --> 31:02.902
Okay.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.780
Okay,

31:05.780 --> 31:07.532
you work your magic.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.616
Yeah.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.744
I'll be waiting.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.209
I hope the hotel has a pool.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.628
Willa,
we're not going to a hotel.

31:20.628 --> 31:21.963
You're leaving.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.464
We're leaving.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.174
You're flying home.

31:25.174 --> 31:27.760
I'm staying here.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.804
But Mom's on vacation.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.472
Not anymore.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.974
Let's talk in the car.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.726
I spend more than
two weekends a month with you,

31:34.726 --> 31:36.603
and you gotta get rid of me?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.482
Get in the car, please, and--

31:41.482 --> 31:42.942
and hold the drama.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.652
You backstabbed me
after you said you wouldn't.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.821
Give me my bag.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.909
Willa, I cannot do my job
and take care of you.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.120
- Mom does.
- And I will not put you

31:54.120 --> 31:56.998
or that nice family
that's offerin' us their home

31:56.998 --> 32:00.168
at any more risk
than I already have.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.755
If you wanted me here,

32:03.755 --> 32:06.132
you would find a way
to keep me safe.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.352
Hell.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.811
Here.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.772
You left it on the dresser.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.031
All right,
you're gonna love this one.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.532
You're gonna love it.
Yeah, get it.

32:31.532 --> 32:32.825
Okay.
There you go.

32:32.825 --> 32:34.535
Down the hatch.
Hit it and quit it.

32:34.535 --> 32:35.828
Here we go. Hey!

32:37.956 --> 32:40.166
Oh, that's
buffalo sweat right there.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.001
151 and Tabasco.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.921
I don't want to know.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.923
Oh, you're so cute.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.717
Hey.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.055
Sandy.
Yeah?

32:54.055 --> 32:55.723
Oh! Oh, God!

32:55.723 --> 32:57.350
Oh, honey.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.977
You all right?
You okay?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.561
Oh, babe, oh.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.438
Oh.
Sandy,

33:02.438 --> 33:05.149
my sweet apple half...

33:06.693 --> 33:09.862
Oh, my God!

33:09.862 --> 33:11.572
Oh, my--oh, my God.

33:11.572 --> 33:15.368
I would very much like
to ask for your sister's hand.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.328
Do you bless?

33:17.328 --> 33:19.330
Mm,

33:19.330 --> 33:21.207
- I don't know.
- What?

33:21.207 --> 33:23.001
What is it?
Tell me.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.670
You know, that secret room
story, I don't know.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.879
Is true.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.214
Eh, I think
you might be trying

33:28.214 --> 33:29.924
to impress me a little bit.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.928
You don't believe me, bro?

33:33.928 --> 33:36.723
Come on.
I'll take you right now.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.932
You'll see.

33:37.932 --> 33:40.393
Hey!

33:40.393 --> 33:42.270
Okay, all right.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.438
Oh, okay.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.939
You good
to drive, big guy? Huh?

33:44.939 --> 33:47.108
I know a little Albanian.
I heard that joke.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.485
No, no. It's an actual word--

33:49.485 --> 33:51.446
<i>pordhe.</i>

33:51.446 --> 33:53.781
It means "fart."

33:53.781 --> 33:55.491
I don't even wanna hear
how you picked that up.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.490
All right, here we go.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.334
What's your problem, bro?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.504
<i>♪ I can hear your mama ♪</i>

34:51.172 --> 34:53.466

34:59.263 --> 35:01.349

35:11.484 --> 35:12.902

35:20.701 --> 35:21.994
- Come on, man.
- I'm 6'5".

35:21.994 --> 35:23.329

You taste like love.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.574
Mm!

36:12.295 --> 36:14.046
And buy this building

36:14.046 --> 36:16.090
and convert it to lofts.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.677
You know, cool,
high-end, expensive.

36:19.677 --> 36:23.639
Really, really good business
for us.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.604
Penthouse.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.898
Yes, very nice.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.192
After the World War II,
they build tough,

36:34.192 --> 36:36.027
mm, like, um...

36:36.027 --> 36:38.112
Brick shithouse.
Yeah, that!

36:38.112 --> 36:41.365
A shithouse,
like <i>Three Little Pigs.</i>

36:41.365 --> 36:43.618
You gonna blow my house down, bro?

36:43.618 --> 36:46.162
I don't think so.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.627
So I hired
a chick for this place--

36:52.627 --> 36:55.504
real professional,
knows a lot about art--

36:55.504 --> 37:00.635
and I told her,
"Find me cool shit,"

37:00.635 --> 37:02.345
like paintings that's powerful

37:02.345 --> 37:03.846
and looks good
behind the couch.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.557
Slivovitz?

37:06.557 --> 37:07.725
Say what?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.727
Or I have Bell's in the fridge.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.812
No.

37:11.812 --> 37:15.066
What, you don't
want to hang first?

37:15.066 --> 37:20.404
I think you know what I want,
you old bullshitter.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.585
I told you!

37:44.428 --> 37:45.972
I'll be a son of a gun.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.140
It's like a sexy panic room.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.268
