00:00.734 --> 00:01.802
<i>Previously on</i>
The Good Doctor...

00:02.570 --> 00:05.939
I feel something. A crush.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.342
Shaun,
did you change
the surgical plan?

00:08.476 --> 00:11.011
The parameters
it was based on changed.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.013
I adjusted accordingly.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.815
And ignored my instructions?

00:14.948 --> 00:17.218
Your bedside manner
is impressive.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.820
I spent two years
in Afghanistan.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.989
- You okay?
- No, I am not okay.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.357
<i>I'm so sick of this chair.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:26.760
<i>And I hate that my body
won't do what I want.</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:28.529
And I hate Shaun Murphy.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.466
What exactly
do you want from me?

00:32.600 --> 00:35.035
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.571
And everybody here
seems completely fine with it.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.939
I'm not fine with it.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.474
I don't want you to ask me
about my personal life,

00:40.608 --> 00:42.143
and I don't want
to hear about yours.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.946
From now on, our relationship
is medicine only.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.695
<i>Weather,
San Francisco Bay Area.</i>

01:01.829 --> 01:03.564
<i>Monday, 66.</i>

01:03.697 --> 01:06.200
<i>Tuesday, partly cloudy, 67.</i>

01:06.334 --> 01:09.403
<i>Wednesday,
72, sunny. 61 low.</i>

01:12.173 --> 01:13.907
Good morning.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.043
- You had the volume up
very loud.
- Sorry.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.546
I was watching <i>Hairspray</i>
before you got home last night.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.749
At those decibels,
damage to the inner ear
is very possible.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.517
Daddy, chill.
It was only for the last song.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.186
Hm.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.924
- Couldn't sleep again?
- I needed to read these.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.730
If you're feeling
anxious or upset,

01:36.864 --> 01:37.865
you know you can talk to me.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.433
I'm not anxious or upset.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.436
You've already read all those.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.871
Information retention
is increased

01:44.004 --> 01:45.439
by multiple exposures
over time.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.679
I'm sure Lim
just needs some time.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.548
She's struggling to adjust,
which is understandable.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.717
Yes, it's okay.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.453
I still have
Dr. Glassman and Dr. Andrews

01:59.587 --> 02:01.922
as mentors and other friends

02:02.055 --> 02:04.992
I can go to for advice.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.263
Steve always said
that if someone
didn't want to be my friend,

02:09.397 --> 02:10.431
it's their problem.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.865
So I shouldn't worry about it.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.002
Your brother was pretty smart.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.604
Oh. Yes, he was.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.707
Oh, I have to go.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.575
I'm meeting
Dr. Glassman for pancakes.

Good morning.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.156
I haven't seen you
around lately.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.791
Yeah, I've been
really busy at work.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.960
- Oh, I know the feeling.
- Mm.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.962
That Murphy guy
still making
your life miserable?

03:15.095 --> 03:17.130
Actually, no.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.000
We had
a very... honest discussion.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.202
I set some boundaries,
feel good about it.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.437
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.805
I bet that's a relief.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.342
Sorry I was such a mess
in the garage last week.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.210
Oh. It was nothing.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.513
Not true, but thank you.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.647
I owe you.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.451
Actually, I could use a ride
to the airport tomorrow.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.552
I have a 6:00 a.m. flight.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.655
- Okay. Um...
- I'm kidding.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.557
I was happy to help.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.026
- Have a good one.
- You too.

For once,
my complete clumsiness
actually paid off.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.515
Might change your mind
when you get the cleaning bill.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.883
It was worth every penny.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.453
I'd gladly sacrifice
another shirt
to do it all again.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.687
Hopefully soon?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.890
Or not.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.960
Sorry. I was only in town
to finalize the sale
of our West Coast distributor.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.130
And now that it's done...

04:23.263 --> 04:25.165
Well, I've been looking for
an excuse to visit New York.

04:26.734 --> 04:27.801
I would love that,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.304
but I'm pretty sure
my husband wouldn't.

We've got some powder burns

05:44.912 --> 05:46.580
and a penetrating
shrapnel wound.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.115
Ooh. From playing airsoft?

05:48.248 --> 05:51.118
I'm in a historical battle
reenactment club.

05:51.251 --> 05:55.122
I thought some explosions would
make it more realistic and fun.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.691
One of the fireworks went off
when I was setting it up.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.592
It doesn't look too bad.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.293
It was gushing blood.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.329
It's <i>bleeding.</i>
It's not <i>gushing.</i>

06:02.463 --> 06:04.632
I spent a year
as a Navy corpsman
in Afghanistan,

06:04.765 --> 06:07.435
treated hundreds
of shrapnel wounds
that actually were gushing.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.235
You're gonna be fine.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.804
- Can you move your arm?
- Oh.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.072
Yeah.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.608
Aah! Yeah.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.910
A little.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.779
No step-offs,
good range of motion.

06:18.912 --> 06:19.980
The humerus isn't fractured,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.449
which means
Dr. Powell is right.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.383
You're going to be fine.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.019
Irrigate with antibiotic saline
and get a CT to locate
the fragments.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.688
Page me to the OR
when he's prepped for surgery.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.189
Yes. Will do.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.425
Need help over here.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.026
He's in and out
of consciousness.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.028
BP's in the toilet
from massive blood loss.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.229
Damn.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.998
Fluid resuscitation
initiated en route.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.000
- Shark bite?
- Speedboat.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.969
Got run over on
a predawn skinny-dip.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.837
Luckily his girlfriend's
a former lifeguard,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.539
got him to shore,
applied a tourniquet.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.008
What do we got?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.243
An attending who's 20 minutes
late to his call shift.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.180
Total amputation
of the left lower extremity
at the tibiotalar joint.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.782
- Speedboat propeller.
- Thank you.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.249
See how easy
and productive that was?

06:56.383 --> 06:58.952
Oh, grumpy as well as late.
Must've been a rough night.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.421
It was a great night,
and an even better morning,

07:01.555 --> 07:02.790
not that it's
any of your business.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.758
- Oh, then why tell me?
- Because it bothers you.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.695
What's weird is,
this isn't much different
than when they were dating.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.997
One of the many reasons
we're not anymore.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.599
Transfuse four units PRBC
and stay four ahead.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.233
- On it.
- It's a clean cut.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.769
We got six to eight hours
max of ischemic time.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.237
You're gonna try
to reattach it?

07:17.370 --> 07:18.371
I'm gonna do more than try.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.240
And the proper term
is "replant."

07:20.373 --> 07:22.643
Call it whatever you want,
it's still a bad idea.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.177
Lack of
a sensate plantar surface

07:24.311 --> 07:26.379
would make it likely
no better than a prosthetic.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.582
I disagree, and seeing as
I'm the only attending

07:28.716 --> 07:30.784
who's an actual surgeon,
I'll take it from here.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.987
- Where's the foot?
- I assume
at the bottom of the lake.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.489
You mean the top.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.090
Not unless
he was skinny-dipping
with his shoes on.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.392
- Bodies float.
- Severed feet sink.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.228
Okay, wherever it is,
we need to find it fast.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.462
Get police search and rescue
out there ASAP.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.396
Good luck.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.766
I'll call.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.437
Increase fluid
and blood resuscitation.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.906
If we don't get his BP up,
finding his foot won't matter.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.057
Vitals have stabilized.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.224
He's opening his eyes.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.094
I'm Dr. Park.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.629
You're at
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.296
Can you tell me your name?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.566
Uh, Andy.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.900
You know what city you're in?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.101
San Jose.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.369
Is Brittany here?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.171
Your girlfriend couldn't ride
in the ambulance,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.306
but the EMT said she was
gonna follow in her car.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.675
She's not my girlfriend.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.942
It was our first date.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.444
She saved your life.
Sounds like a keeper.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.480
How many stitches did I need?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.115
She said
the cut was pretty bad.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.689
Andy, I'm sorry,
but your left foot

08:41.822 --> 08:43.123
was completely severed
at the ankle.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.659
What?

08:45.793 --> 08:47.861
It didn't even hurt that much.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.763
You were in hypovolemic shock,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.331
nearly died
from the blood loss.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.634
We need to get you into an OR
to clean and debride the wound.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.068
We'll leave it open for now,

08:55.202 --> 08:56.937
and if we can find the foot,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.606
we'll attempt to replant it.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.741
What do you mean,
if you can find it?

09:04.077 --> 09:04.978
It's in the lake?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.354
Search and rescue
headed to the lake.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.989
I want you guys out there,
as well.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
You need to start
antibiotic irrigation

09:18.058 --> 09:19.693
with pulse lavage
as soon as it's found,

09:19.827 --> 09:21.361
and then get it
in an organ transplant unit

09:21.494 --> 09:22.896
and perfuse during transport.

09:23.030 --> 09:23.997
We're on a clock.
Every second counts.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.134
That lake's huge.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.201
You really think
they're gonna find it?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.369
Well, police divers
find weapons

09:29.502 --> 09:31.238
perps toss in the ocean
all the time.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.073
With metal detectors,
which obviously won't--

09:33.206 --> 09:34.007
Go.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.712
He's lucky.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.682
Not even any occult fractures.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.019
It still blows my mind
you fought in a war.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.589
I wish that we could
get a better view

09:49.723 --> 09:50.824
of the recon images

09:50.958 --> 09:52.392
at the level
of the mid to distal humerus.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.593
Oh, we can.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.029
Watch and learn, young Padawan.

10:01.034 --> 10:01.802
Thanks.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.537
That's... a big one.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.311
What made you decide to enlist?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.246
- Did you have family in the--
- I didn't enlist.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.748
I went to the Naval Academy

10:14.882 --> 10:16.750
and got an officer's commission
after graduation.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.556
There's a brachial
artery pseudoaneurysm.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.893
Looks like the only thing
stopping it from rupturing

10:26.026 --> 10:28.061
is the shrapnel wedged
against the vessel wall.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.963
That's... not good.

10:30.097 --> 10:30.931
We have to get him to the OR.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.800
- I'll page Dr. Murphy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.482
What're you doing?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.820
This lamp
was in the wrong place.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.621
It seemed fine to me.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.624
You're not as easily distracted
by the environment as I am.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.826
Well, I understand,
but next time,

10:58.959 --> 11:00.127
you mind checking with me

11:00.260 --> 11:01.128
before you start
rearranging furniture?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.664
I think
you'll like the lamps here.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.999
That's not the point.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.801
I have to get to the OR.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.308
Park has more confidence
in the cops than I do.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.510
There's no way
they're gonna find it in time.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.380
I had a cousin who lost
her engagement ring
in a Halloween corn maze.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.283
A year later, the farmer
found it inside an ear of corn.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.519
If you believe that,
there's a Nigerian prince
I'd love to introduce you to.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.989
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.659
The farmer found it
the same day she lost it,
probably in the bathroom.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.328
He figured he'd let
the commotion die down
before he tried to sell it.

11:35.462 --> 11:40.433
Then someone in his family
got cancer or something else
he needed the Lord's help with.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.669
He couldn't very well pray
for divine intervention

11:42.803 --> 11:44.137
with a hot diamond
in his sock drawer.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.008
You have a very fertile
and cynical imagination.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.643
Thank you.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.645
I've been listening to that
<i>Ten Percent Happier</i> podcast,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.147
so I'm all about
the positive vibes.

11:54.948 --> 11:55.949
Our foot will be found.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.385
I got 20 bucks
says you're wrong.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.155
Oh, come on, Mr. Positive,
you can't lose.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.027
- It's a bet.
- Okay.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.871
Stop being so dramatic.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.172
<i>You</i> stop being so dramatic.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.908
The next one is--
is the top one.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.675
Stop second dealing.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.244
I don't want a pilonidal cyst.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.545
I just had a guy with jock-itch

12:25.678 --> 12:27.380
that was
up to his belly button.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.917
And I just had a guy
with a plantar wart infection
who hasn't changed socks

12:30.050 --> 12:31.084
since
the Carter Administration.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.953
The next one is the top one.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.021
Take it.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.591
Do you have a minute?

12:39.692 --> 12:40.460
Yes.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.832
I was just curious about how
your breakfast with Shaun went.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.766
I canceled.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.105
Uh, I'm worried about him.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.575
He won't admit it,
but I can tell what Lim said
is still really bothering him.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.410
If you're worried about him,
then you should talk to Shaun.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.946
I tried that.
He says he's fine.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.614
It's not just about Shaun.
You know that, right?

13:01.748 --> 13:03.216
No, it's not.
Lim is shutting him out.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.717
'Cause Lim is hurting.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.954
Shaun's gotta take some kind
of responsibility for that.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.288
Why? He didn't hurt her.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.026
It's not so cut and dried,
certainly not to Lim.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.663
- Well, what about for you?
- What about for me?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.566
If Shaun's
got a problem with Lim,
then he's gotta deal with it.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.375
A medial longitudinal incision

13:28.508 --> 13:31.411
is used to extend the wound
above and below.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.446
Next steps, Dr. Powell?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.416
Place clamps
both proximal and distal,
locate the foreign bodies,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.385
and remove and suture
with a 6-0 running.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.452
That's exactly right.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.955
Place the vascular clamps.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.156
The Navy
definitely gave you

13:43.290 --> 13:45.058
some good training
in trauma care.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.426
Is that why you went
to the Academy?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.962
Thought it would help you
get into med school?

13:49.096 --> 13:51.564
Can we get
a little bit more irrigation, please?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.300
Did you ever want work
on a fishing boat?

13:55.335 --> 13:58.638
At my high school,
the people who talked about
joining the military

13:58.771 --> 14:00.840
also wanted to work
on fishing boats in Alaska.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.543
I hate fishing.
It's both cruel and boring.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.311
Hm.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.417
I'm guessing
the shrapnel in Afghanistan

14:10.550 --> 14:12.719
didn't have clown faces
printed on it?

14:12.852 --> 14:13.853
Nope.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.061
Wait, can I see that?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.663
That looks like it's from
a propulsive charge,
not a shell.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.498
- What's the difference?
- Shut off the electrocautery.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.367
- There's still some bleeding--
- No, no, no, don't!

14:27.500 --> 14:28.335
Aah!

14:29.302 --> 14:30.870
What the hell was that?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.040
Firework mortar
the electrocautery detonated.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.146
His brachial artery's shredded.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.395
We stopped the bleeding
and restored blood flow
to your arm,

14:56.196 --> 14:57.630
but it's only a partial fix.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.232
You'll need more tests
and then surgery
to do a tissue flap

14:59.366 --> 15:00.700
and to stabilize
the shattered humerus.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.671
How could it explode again?

15:04.804 --> 15:06.706
Aerial fireworks
have two explosive charges.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.042
The shrapnel
from the propulsive charge

15:09.176 --> 15:11.979
obstructed the CT view
of the undetonated mortar.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.847
You're very lucky.
If it had exploded
in the field,

15:14.982 --> 15:17.084
you would've bled to death
in under 90 seconds.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.152
Ah, I don't feel very lucky.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.554
We can increase
your hydromorphone.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.124
You can pretend that you're
in a combat support hospital.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.592
Make it all part
of the "realistic fun."

15:29.262 --> 15:30.930
Mm.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.034
I doubt that will help,
but you can try.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.576
Ah, it feels like it's on fire.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.545
Almost done. For now.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.080
We'll need to repeat this
every two hours

15:47.214 --> 15:48.915
to make sure you're ready to go
the moment the foot arrives.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.555
Can you check my phone again?

15:59.026 --> 15:59.792
Nothing yet. Sorry.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.335
I know
it was just a first date,

16:08.468 --> 16:11.804
but... I thought
it was going really well.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.042
I always think that,

16:15.175 --> 16:19.279
and then find out
I talked too much
or not enough,

16:20.447 --> 16:21.548
or she actually did like me,

16:21.681 --> 16:23.350
but she's heading off
to grad school

16:23.483 --> 16:26.253
or doesn't want
anything exclusive.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.288
She's probably
stuck in traffic.

16:33.593 --> 16:37.430
Maybe-- Maybe some people
are just meant to be alone.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.805
Yeah, I met
a great woman last night.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.007
Found out this morning
she was married.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.742
That's in the wake of a divorce

16:49.876 --> 16:53.646
and a serious relationship
that crashed and burned
a few months ago.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.485
You know,
finding the right person,
it's pretty damn hard.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.621
You gotta keep trying.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.464
Dr. Park and I
are very different.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.999
You can't have
your own office, Murphy.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.667
But prior attendings--

17:14.801 --> 17:16.969
Were hired
when we had different
budgetary constraints.

17:17.104 --> 17:20.039
Okay, Dr. Park and I
have different work methods.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.442
Neither of us
can perform at our best
in a shared office.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.844
There are no other offices available,

17:24.977 --> 17:27.847
and I'm quite confident
you and Park can make it work.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.349
You're just gonna have to make
a few compromises.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.783
- Mm. But--
- And if I know Park,

17:30.917 --> 17:33.486
I'm guessing
he's already made a few,
which means...

17:35.488 --> 17:36.556
it's your turn.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.637
Officer Baxter?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.205
That's me.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.373
Dr. Perez, this is Dr. Allen.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.875
No foot yet.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.410
Just a bunch of old ball caps,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.746
beer bottles,
and dirty diapers.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.914
Some people just don't
deserve nice things.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.616
- Was that on the bottom?
- Yeah.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.518
Actually got us excited
for a minute.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.887
I'd find some shade.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.389
We're gonna be here a while.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.358
It's really important that
we find it as soon as possible.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.692
We'll find it when we find it.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.465
Okay.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.567
All right, well,
I'll be right back.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.269
I got a beach towel
in my trunk.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.003
You going for a swim?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.505
No, just want to be able
to sit down without
getting my pants dirty.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.274
Oh. Look at you, all prepared.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.575
- Yep.
- Such a Boy Scout!

18:30.210 --> 18:31.278
What about me?

18:31.411 --> 18:32.745
It's big enough for both of us.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.555
Severe trauma
to the distal subclavian.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.124
We can do the bypass
more proximally
than we'd planned.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.960
I've seen it done
in a Role 3 field hospital.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.329
It'll work.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.398
Surprised you're so invested.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.433
You certainly didn't seem
that sympathetic in the room.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.567
I shouldn't have said that.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.971
I can see how it would be
upsetting to deal with a guy

18:59.105 --> 19:00.573
who thinks combat
is a fun game to play.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.577
- Were you ever in actual--
- I was wrong.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.646
Well, it's okay.
We all let our personal--

19:06.779 --> 19:08.948
No, I mean about the bypass.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.150
There's avulsion
of multiple nerves
just beyond the plexus.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.620
So even if we can
restore blood flow,

19:13.753 --> 19:16.489
the arm would still be immobile
and without sensation.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.861
We're gonna have to amputate.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.771
We're not going to do that.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.442
We can use external fixation
to stabilize the fracture,

19:35.575 --> 19:37.810
thoracotomy for the
subclavian artery bypass,

19:37.944 --> 19:40.179
and repair
the peripheral nerves
with sural grafts from his leg.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.415
There are
multiple nerves damaged.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.251
Then we will find
multiple solutions.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.618
We are not going to amputate.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.021
Dr. Murphy, we need to talk.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.156
I'm busy.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.624
So am I, so I'll make it fast.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.797
Keep looking for a solution
to those nerve injuries.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.198
I will be right back.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.636
Really? Uh...

20:04.971 --> 20:06.739
And my desk is facing a window?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.609
I also moved my desk
several inches.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.778
Dr. Andrews said we both
needed to make compromises.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.813
Okay, Shaun,
I told you this morning--

20:13.946 --> 20:15.548
Yes, now neither of us
will be bothered

20:15.682 --> 20:17.484
because we won't be facing
each other as we work.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.918
I'm not bothered by that,
and if you are,

20:19.051 --> 20:20.287
then you should turn
your desk around.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.655
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't work facing a window.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.057
People constantly
walking by outside--

20:25.191 --> 20:27.126
You're not the only person who
needs a comfortable environment

20:27.260 --> 20:28.961
to do their job.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.797
Now, I don't care
what you do with your stuff,

20:30.930 --> 20:33.366
but do not move
or touch anything
that belongs to me again.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.851
Page me if you find
a surgical solution.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.323
Murphy wants his own office.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.225
- Is that surprising?
- No.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.429
What was surprising
was him coming to me
instead of his supervisor.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.865
Okay.
I'm not sure why you're
sharing that with me.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.234
Is there a problem
between Murphy and Lim
I should be aware of?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.603
Maybe.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
Care to elaborate?

21:13.740 --> 21:17.043
If there's a problem
between Lim and Shaun,
why are you asking me?

21:17.176 --> 21:18.445
Because I value your insight,

21:18.578 --> 21:20.279
and I'm under the impression

21:20.413 --> 21:21.881
that they're both
close friends of yours.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.318
Okay, so it's
definitely my responsibility
to sort that out.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.392
Mm...

21:34.394 --> 21:37.263
Not a bad spot
for a post-date skinny-dip.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.931
As long as you stay out
of the speedboat lane.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.400
Mm-hmm.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.301
You're not a skinny-dipper?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.436
Definitely not.

21:44.571 --> 21:48.641
Ooh. A strong aversion. Interesting.

21:48.775 --> 21:52.011
Ahh. Is it the--
uh, the cold water, the nudity,
or you just hate swimming?

21:53.279 --> 21:54.981
All of the above.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.249
I don't do outdoor naked
or outdoor hookups.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.485
Mm.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.821
Same goes for cars,
airplanes, elevators.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.290
Mm.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.626
I'm more of a comfortable,
private spot type of girl.

22:08.094 --> 22:08.761
Good to know.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.800
I definitely agree
on the planes and elevators,

22:13.933 --> 22:15.568
and I'm not a big fan
of cars myself,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.737
but, uh, tractor combines...

22:17.870 --> 22:20.239
phew, they're
a whole 'nother story.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.677
- Tractor combines?
- Mm-hmm.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.413
I don't know. Just something
about being high up,

22:26.546 --> 22:30.182
looking out over
a few hundred acres of alfalfa
blowing in the breeze.

22:32.284 --> 22:36.122
- What?
- You are a strange dude.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.790
And why do you keep
a beach towel in your trunk?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.227
I do yoga in the park
after work.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.995
Ah, yes, the yoga.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.164
- You should try it sometime.
- Mm.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.166
Might help soften up
some of that cynicism.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.368
I'd rather be cynical
than gullible.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.772
Found a diamond ring
in an ear of corn.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.007
Oh, God. It's true, all right?
You can ask my dad.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.143
He's known that farmer
his entire life.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.811
And now I know
where you got it from.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.180
The apple doesn't fall far
from the alfalfa.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.383
Okay.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.894
There's an active bleed
at the debridement site.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.666
- BP's plummeting.
- Damn it.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.167
We have to get
the stump closed.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.902
No, that'll make it impossible
to replant his foot.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.403
There's still time
for them to find it.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.106
I just need to stop the bleed.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.050
I can't
get the bleeding under control.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.420
If I ligate,
it'll clot, but if I don't,

23:41.554 --> 23:43.623
the reduced flow will destroy
everything we've already fixed.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.025
Still no word?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.662
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Allen.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.763
They still haven't found it.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.436
Let's get him to the OR.
We need to fully
close the wound.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.774
You tried your best.

24:09.716 --> 24:10.750
What're you doing, Murphy?

24:10.883 --> 24:12.819
Oh. Setting up my new office.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.387
No, you're not.
I told you there was
no extra space.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.089
But you were wrong.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.691
Nurse Hawks told me this room

24:18.825 --> 24:20.593
has not been used
by anyone in months.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.197
Because we need it for storage.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.233
We can still use it
for storage.

24:27.366 --> 24:30.603
There's room for my new desk
and all this other stuff,

24:30.737 --> 24:33.806
which won't distract me
by sharpening pencils,
doing back stretches,

24:33.940 --> 24:36.142
looking at me, or breathing.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.648
Fine. For now.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.449
But as soon as
someone needs it,
I'm kicking you out.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.117
Thank you, Dr. Andrews!

24:54.761 --> 24:55.728
Yeah.

24:56.763 --> 24:57.697
Okay.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.533
Got it.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.701
You owe me 20 bucks.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.870
We still have another hour.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.471
Park couldn't control
the bleeding.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.173
He's moving the guy to the OR
to close the wound.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.507
We can still scrub in
if we beat traffic.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.112
Hey! Where are you going?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.183
I got five little piggies
that need to go home.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.619
Page Park.

25:19.752 --> 25:20.953
Already am.

25:25.391 --> 25:28.695
We need to repair the left
subclavian artery first.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.462
But we still need a way
to get distal control.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.331
Couldn't we just extend
the incision

25:32.464 --> 25:34.867
to the supraclavicular one?

25:35.001 --> 25:37.436
No. That risks transection
of the phrenic nerve.

25:40.272 --> 25:44.343
So, why <i>did</i> you want to join
the Navy?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.146
Couldn't afford to pay
for college?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.682
You wanted to see the world?

25:49.816 --> 25:52.318
Why are you
so obsessed with this?

25:52.451 --> 25:55.387
I'm just... curious.
I'm trying to get to know you.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.790
Clearly, you have some sort
of judgmental notion

25:57.924 --> 25:59.859
about the type of people
that join the military.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.731
I'm not judging you.
I'm genuinely impressed.

26:04.864 --> 26:08.034
Because I know how to treat
a puncture wound and read a CT?

26:11.037 --> 26:15.574
Do you have such low
expectations of all veterans
or just the amputees?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.780
Hello.
I have resolved the issue.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.350
We use biopolymer grafts
to repair multiple nerves.

26:24.483 --> 26:27.887
Oh. I can definitely think
more clearly in my new office.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.521
Great.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.531
Forceps.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.735
Some of the
tissues edges look necrotic.

26:42.869 --> 26:43.936
You gonna be able
to remove it all?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.437
Hope so.
Grab the DeBakey scissors

26:45.571 --> 26:46.739
and cut off
the non-viable tissue.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.248
You mind keeping
your eyes on the road?

26:56.382 --> 26:58.918
Sorry. It's just...
that's pretty cool.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.292
6-0 on a prolene castro.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.764
Get the transplant unit
open and ready.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.565
It's been seven hours
of cold ischemia time.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.067
We gotta get it perfused ASAP.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.069
All right.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.728
It's nearing
the eight-hour mark.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.831
They got off
the freeway four minutes ago.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.065
Could be traffic.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.734
No, they're in
a squad car with a siren.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.301
Which you'd think
would make people
get out of the way,

27:49.435 --> 27:50.169
but apparently not.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.576
Nice color. Healthy edges.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.680
Great work.
Scrub in, and let's do this.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.288
Biopolymer grafts
aren't going to work.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.957
The gap's too wide.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.292
Nerve defects from
the explosion are too big.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.294
Even if
we bridge the nerves,

28:15.427 --> 28:16.362
what do we do about
all this bleeding?

28:18.831 --> 28:19.999
We have to amputate.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.001
We have no choice.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.040
Dr. Murphy?

28:39.451 --> 28:41.320
We can do
an end-to-side neurorrhaphy

28:41.453 --> 28:42.755
with coaptation
of the distal stump

28:42.889 --> 28:44.723
of the transected nerves
to adjacent donor nerves.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.292
But what do we do
about the bleeding?

28:46.425 --> 28:47.860
- If we can't stop it--
- We can facilitate anastomosis

28:47.994 --> 28:49.295
by using
the parachute technique.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.163
- We're running out of time.
- I can do it.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.207
Stabilizing
the ankle joint.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.911
Matching the ends
of the posterior tibial
and dorsalis pedis arteries.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.078
His date ever show up?

29:06.212 --> 29:07.579
- Nope.
- Use 7-0 prolenes.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.615
I sort of feel bad for the guy.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.350
In all fairness, was it right
for him to expect her to?

29:11.483 --> 29:13.352
Well, seems like
the decent thing to do.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.687
Repairing the vena comitans
and saphenous vein.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.089
Saving his life wasn't enough?

29:17.223 --> 29:18.858
Ah, she still could show up,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.893
and this could be a crazy story
they tell their kids one day.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.229
Sorry, Mr. Positive,
but that will
definitely not happen.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.031
You never know.
Most of the people I know

29:25.164 --> 29:27.766
who are in great relationships
had super rocky starts.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.743
I can't get
any pulse on the foot.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.311
The anastomosis sites
are hemostatic.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.913
Hey,
check Doppler at the femoral,

29:41.047 --> 29:42.581
then work your way down
to where the flow stops.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.217
Good in the groin.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.619
No flow here.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.355
He's thrombosed all the way
to his popliteal.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.390
We may have
just saved his foot,
but killed his leg.

30:01.667 --> 30:02.234
Shaun?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.737
I just saved my patient's arm.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.240
I heard that. That--
That's good-- good work.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.143
Do you like my new office?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.747
No, I don't. I don't like it.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.417
Mm. I've already talked
to Dr. Andrews.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.886
- He agreed--
- It's a bad idea.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.421
No. Dr. Park and I distract
and annoy each other.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.755
We will both do
better work if--

30:23.890 --> 30:26.092
- That's the reason? Really?
- Yes, it is.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.629
Why are you isolating yourself?

30:31.597 --> 30:33.565
I'm not.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.834
You're the one who canceled
our breakfast.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.337
Because I don't want to have
to deal with this, Shaun.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.272
I'm a--

30:41.473 --> 30:43.275
I'm angry with you.

30:44.743 --> 30:45.544
Oh.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.680
- Why?
-"Why?"

30:51.250 --> 30:53.619
Because of Lim's surgery.
Because I told you
exactly what to do...

30:53.752 --> 30:55.621
- No. No.
- ...and you didn't
listen to me.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.323
- The parameters changed.
- You went ahead and you--

30:57.456 --> 30:59.725
and you did the procedure
you wanted to do all along.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.994
Yes, the parameters changed.
I made the right decision.

31:02.128 --> 31:06.098
Shaun, Lim is paralyzed.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.768
You're the surgeon.
You have to take some kind
of responsibility for that.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.173
You shouldn't be angry with me.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.310
- Dr. Lim shouldn't be
angry with me.
- She--

31:20.012 --> 31:22.314
She is paralyzed, Shaun.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.219
Mm. I saved her life.
I made the right choice.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.420
You're acting like a child.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.721
No. No. I'm not.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.323
You're acting like you did
back in high school,

31:31.457 --> 31:33.059
like you did at--
at the beginning of med school.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.127
You're a grown man, Shaun.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.862
You're--
You're a married man now.

31:36.996 --> 31:40.299
You got to take
some kind of responsibility, accountability.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.767
You're running away.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.003
You're-- You're--
You're shrinking
your world around you.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.671
You're-- You're retreating.

31:52.811 --> 31:53.379
You're wrong.

31:55.181 --> 31:57.516
You are being mean
and calling me a child.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.118
- Shaun...
- And you are taking
Dr. Lim's side--

31:59.251 --> 32:00.519
Shaun,
you can't shrug this off.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.388
I do not want you in my office.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.825
Leave now!

32:36.722 --> 32:39.225
We successfully repaired
your shoulder.

32:39.725 --> 32:40.459
Thank you.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.130
Please don't play
with any more fireworks.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.764
You are lucky to have
survived your own ignorance.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.400
Yeah.

32:48.534 --> 32:51.003
At the very least, stick
to the non-explosive ones.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.405
I'll just, uh,
stick to watching them
on the 4th of July.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.574
Probably for the best.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.243
Mm.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.579
With lots of rehab,
you should regain
full function of your arm.

33:00.712 --> 33:01.647
Mm.

33:09.888 --> 33:10.922
Feel that?

33:12.091 --> 33:13.425
Just a small pinch.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.995
Well, that's exactly
what we want.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.931
Six months of PT,
and you should be up
on your feet walking again.

33:22.301 --> 33:26.238
Thanks, Doc, for holding out
and not giving up on me...

33:27.239 --> 33:28.274
and my foot.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.279
Do me a favor?

33:33.412 --> 33:35.047
Take a picture of me
and that gnarly scar.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.816
- This for Brittany?
- Nah.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.352
My new profile pic.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.194
You will stand out.

34:17.423 --> 34:18.490
I'm sorry I offended you.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.395
I grew up very... sheltered.

34:26.898 --> 34:31.537
I'm still trying
to figure things out
and play catch-up

34:31.670 --> 34:35.974
and get past
my limited sense
of imagination...

34:37.176 --> 34:38.677
which is just a long way
of saying that yes,

34:38.810 --> 34:41.213
I was being ignorant
and judgy and...

34:43.815 --> 34:45.217
I hope you can forgive me.

34:53.392 --> 34:56.094
I, um, tore my ACL.

34:57.529 --> 34:58.397
Um...

35:01.032 --> 35:04.370
growing up,
my dream was to play
Division 1 soccer,

35:06.338 --> 35:07.539
and I was pretty good.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.444
Junior year of high school,
I had a dozen offers
for a full ride.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.515
That's impressive.

35:16.648 --> 35:20.186
The first game of senior year,
I tore my ACL trying to
slide tackle a midfielder.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.257
And just like that,
every D-1 school rescinded.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.559
The only place
that still wanted me
was the Naval Academy.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.463
I never really had much
interest in the military,

35:31.597 --> 35:34.065
but, hey, the tuition was free.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.934
I was promised a roster spot.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.804
I played
all four years on varsity,

35:38.937 --> 35:41.207
and we even won
the Patriot League championship
my senior year.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.579
Nine months later,
I was deployed to Afghanistan.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.985
That sounds horrible.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.923
Not at all.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.991
Joining the Navy
was the best decision
I ever made.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.677
I enjoyed
our field trip.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.346
I had
a good time, too.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.615
Being away from the hospital
and all that. Yeah.

36:23.749 --> 36:24.816
It's definitely
nice out here.

36:26.151 --> 36:28.186
I might even
have to come back
for a swim.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.621
You could
bring a date.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.123
Not a bad idea.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.892
Just need to find
the right person.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.328
Hm.

36:38.096 --> 36:38.797
The bet.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.100
Yes. The bet.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.658
I'm sorry. I just...

37:10.996 --> 37:11.663
I can't.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.950
Need some help?

37:32.083 --> 37:35.621
Although, it's after 5:00,
so I'd have to charge you
time and a half.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.590
Sweet of you to offer,
but I think I got this.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.561
- Ohh!
- You sure?

37:42.694 --> 37:43.695
It'd be a shame if this...

37:45.196 --> 37:47.833
$70 bottle of olive oil
hit the ground.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.601
Well, I had a good day.
I splurged a bit.

37:49.735 --> 37:50.869
Good idea.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.071
I'm sure you deserve it.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.373
You do, too.

37:55.173 --> 37:55.941
For saving me twice.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.109
Can I offer you a taste?

37:58.243 --> 38:00.879
I got a baguette at Listo's,
a Brie, a Gouda.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.214
It's a deal.

38:04.950 --> 38:05.784
Thanks.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.455
This is nice.

38:43.589 --> 38:47.058
Talking to someone
I don't have to supervise
or be serious with.

38:47.192 --> 38:47.793
I agree.

38:49.461 --> 38:53.064
I just realized
I don't know what you do.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.766
I'm a professional
hockey player.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.168
Okay, I know that's a joke.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.838
Now I just have to decide
if that means
you love hockey or hate it.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.507
Now I'm curious
what you'll decide.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.841
Hmm. Let's see.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.845
- You grew up in Michigan.
- Mm-hmm.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.680
You appear to have
all your teeth.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.315
Oh, but they're also perfect,

39:10.449 --> 39:12.384
which means
they could be veneers.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.286
I'm gonna say
you're a Pistons fan
that hates hockey.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.022
It's like you can see
right through me.

39:18.289 --> 39:19.958
And my job?

39:20.091 --> 39:21.593
Clearly, you're the
parking garage attendant.

39:21.727 --> 39:22.861
Or you're just stalking me.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.263
I'm a marketing exec
at Greenzy.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.798
Mm.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.034
I have no idea
what you guys do,
but I know your building.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.169
There's an amazing
Chilean restaurant
right across the street.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.138
- Valeska's.
- Oh, I love that place.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.806
I've been craving
their sopapillas.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.542
We should take care
of that craving.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.709
Dinner at Valeska's sometime?

39:39.210 --> 39:39.811
Definitely.

39:41.847 --> 39:42.814
Mm, yeah.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.889
- You okay?
- Yes.

39:51.857 --> 39:52.991
Thinking about work.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.828
I saved my patient's arm today.

39:56.962 --> 39:57.996
I should be happy.

39:59.097 --> 39:59.865
So why aren't you?

40:02.300 --> 40:03.902
If this is about
your fight with Glassman--

40:04.035 --> 40:06.071
I'm thinking about
my patient's shoulder.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.728
I have to go.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.442
- Dr. Glassman!
- Okay! Okay!

40:44.576 --> 40:46.444
Okay! Okay. What?

40:47.579 --> 40:48.847
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

40:48.980 --> 40:49.881
I know how to fix it.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.283
I know how to fix everything.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.255
There's a surgery
that will cure Lim's paralysis.

41:02.594 --> 41:03.529
Oh.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.664
Okay.
