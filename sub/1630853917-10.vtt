00:38.872 --> 00:40.082
What are you looking at?

00:43.168 --> 00:45.796
Come on. She needs us.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.632
Let's go inside.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.553
So they found him,
crashed up against the tree.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.346
He was cold.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.349
Dead for hours.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.310
Dead for hours, Eva.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.693
Oh, my God.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.653
Grace, I'm so sorry.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.405
-What happened?
-We don't fucking know.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.323
Sorry.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.660
-Do you want some tea, Urs?
-No, she doesn't want tea.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.161
She doesn't-- Someone should make you tea.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.956
-Becka, the--
-No! I'm fucking listening.

01:22.875 --> 01:23.876
Go on, Grace.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.212
We had my birthday dinner.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.298
And it was lovely.

01:30.716 --> 01:34.094
So I said, "Let's have an early night."

01:35.846 --> 01:37.806
And he just got so angry with me.

01:38.348 --> 01:42.352
So, he left. Went off on the bike
to the pub to watch the match, so…

01:42.436 --> 01:43.729
I just went to bed.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.606
I was just--

01:47.274 --> 01:48.483
just so hurt.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.865
It was my birthday,
and I just wanted to be with my husband.

01:55.741 --> 01:59.828
I didn't know why he'd do that to me.
Just leave me like that.

01:59.912 --> 02:00.913
Because he was a prick.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.669
Hey. Of course you were hurt, Gracie.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.630
I'm so sorry.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.507
How am I gonna tell Blanaid?

02:15.594 --> 02:16.595
He's dead.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.640
He's dead.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.156
Oh, my God!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.293
Poor Gracie.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.048
Oh, God, I don't know how to feel.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.301
I do.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.346
He saved us all a lot of hassle.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.939
Ding-dong, the prick is dead.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.036
Hey. Is she okay?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.288
What's happened?

04:48.372 --> 04:50.249
She needs an emergency C-section.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.460
They don't know if they'll…

04:53.544 --> 04:56.171
Oh, Christ. I'll head over now.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.923
No, I don't need you here.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.884
-Have you a pen?
-Yeah. Hang on.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.182
Have you found a pen?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.935
You sh--
You don't have a pen on your desk.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.645
There'll be a pen there somewhere.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.273
I can't find a pen.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.566
Matt, there's pens.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.901
Look, it's fine. I'll just-- Just tell me.
I'll remember.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.027
Fine!

05:19.111 --> 05:21.446
I'm gonna be off radar
for I don't know how long.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.323
Respond to anything in my in-box.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.033
Post Malcolm Tunnoch his GAA tickets.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.828
They're his "thank you" for getting me
the psychiatric report on Williams.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.496
They're on the desk. You can't miss them.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.417
Okay, GAA tickets for Malcolm.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.877
-Anything else?
-I don't know, Matt.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.046
I mean, is there anything else you
can think of before it's all over for us?

05:39.381 --> 05:40.841
Before I'm in a cell?

05:41.466 --> 05:46.305
Before some man moves into my home?
Makes my family sever all contact with me.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.640
Not even a wedding photo left on the…

05:48.724 --> 05:51.018
-What are you talking about? What man?
-I don't know.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.186
I couldn't sleep last night.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.272
The future got very dark.
It got very specific.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.025
Look, you're not going to jail,
Thomas, okay?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.944
We know now for sure
Becka wasn't with her sisters.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.613
It's too late for all that now.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.698
We took our eye off the ball.
We should have done more.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.035
We exhumed the body, Tom, for God--
Oh, shit!

06:08.118 --> 06:09.203
Listen, I've gotta go.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.080
Look, just--
Tom, don't worry. Tru-- Please trust me.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.916
I have everything under control.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.515
Matt!

06:40.317 --> 06:41.944
Why were you hiding behind your desk?

06:42.027 --> 06:44.488
I wasn't. I was looking for a pen.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.784
I thought you were ghosting me.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.078
You didn't text me back yesterday.

06:51.161 --> 06:56.208
No. Just, Thomas is actually--

06:56.708 --> 06:59.503
-Thomas is in hospital.
-Good.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.673
I mean, I'm sorry. That's-- Is he okay?

07:02.756 --> 07:06.426
Yeah, no, it's his wife. Their baby.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.972
They have complications,
so I'm gonna head over there in a bit.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.689
So, yeah.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.026
I will call you when I know more.

07:31.869 --> 07:38.250
Becka, so I went to that pub
in Wicklow where JP spent his last night.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.628
And the barmaid said she saw you there.

07:42.629 --> 07:47.926
So, you and your sisters
weren't together at all, were you?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.096
Barmaid got it wrong.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.222
Right.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.436
How'd those postmortem results
work out for you?

07:58.896 --> 08:00.397
Or did you get that wrong too?

08:10.741 --> 08:12.034
Where the hell is Becka?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.368
She's supposed to be here.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.870
She'd better not be with Matt.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.290
Surely she's not following her fanny
at a time like this?

08:20.918 --> 08:23.253
Grace, you okay, honey? You all right?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.172
His walking boots.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.508
I broke these in for him.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.968
I wore them around the house.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.596
Oh, God. He's only just been buried

08:32.679 --> 08:36.058
and I'm boxing up
his life like he was never even here.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.227
He was here all right.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.688
Maybe these would suit Nora?

08:43.273 --> 08:44.983
I don't remember what size she is.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.904
I'm taking offense on Nora's behalf.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.492
We're fucked.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.913
One for Donal?
I think they had the same sense of humor.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.040
Baby Becka.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.794
Grace, we're gonna need more boxes, honey.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.714
Yeah. Hang on.
I'll just pop down to the utility.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.134
This is nice.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.762
I mean, this is awful.

09:13.846 --> 09:18.475
I'm packing up me dead husband's clothes,
but, you know.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.565
I just came--

09:24.648 --> 09:26.567
Just, shut up. Get inside.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.068
Get in.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.035
Matt knows we weren't together
the night John Paul died.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.246
-How the hell does he know that?
-Why were you with Matt?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.915
I just found him hiding
in his fucking office.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.918
-Oh, Christ. It's over.
-Hiding from me.

09:45.002 --> 09:48.130
Look, first of all,
I've had men hide from me, okay?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.174
-Just deal with it.
-He knows I've been lying, Eva.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.258
No, listen.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.427
What if they're onto something?

09:54.303 --> 09:57.556
They firmly believe that someone
was behind John Paul's death, okay?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.893
What if they're right?
What if someone did kill him?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.020
Wha--

10:03.103 --> 10:04.855
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

10:05.522 --> 10:10.277
We were just seeing if we could all
fit in your massive wardrobe.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.571
Eat your heart out, Carrie Bradshaw.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.782
Get in here! So big.

10:15.866 --> 10:16.867
Honestly.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.703
It's massive.

10:49.775 --> 10:52.110
Why do we keep coming here
if there's no booze?

10:52.194 --> 10:53.237
I fancy a soup.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.656
No soup, no booze.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.449
-I want your alibis.
-What?

10:58.033 --> 10:59.409
Where did you all go that night?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.411
Why are you looking at me?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.622
I was with Ben. You know that.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.542
Well, you could have done it together.
You've both plenty of reasons.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.294
And where were you? Your head's been
all over the place since Minna.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.379
Exactly.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.882
The only one mental enough
to do anything on their own is you.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.384
And everyone knows it.

11:15.968 --> 11:19.221
Actually, Eva,
you said point-blank that you'd do it.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.723
Yeah, well I didn't, okay?

11:22.432 --> 11:23.892
What'd you do with the pento anyway?

11:23.976 --> 11:25.102
It's in my wash-bag.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.895
Where's your wash-bag?

11:26.979 --> 11:28.188
-It's at Ben's.
-It's at Be--

11:29.565 --> 11:30.607
It's at Ben's?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.234
But I haven't seen him.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.486
Do you think he might be involved
in any way?

11:35.070 --> 11:38.699
How? He somehow
drugged him and caused him to crash?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.704
Oh, my God.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.165
Just go to Ben's, get the pento,
and then get back to mine.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.792
Okay.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.377
-Go!
-Okay.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.920
Oh, my God.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.882
And no sex.

12:03.599 --> 12:06.977
Sorry I've not been around to see you.

12:07.060 --> 12:12.357
It's just since, you know, JP died,
I needed to be there for Grace.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.944
The insurance company
are still making it difficult for her.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.779
They won't pay out.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.951
They think there's foul play of some kind
in JP's death.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.370
Wouldn't that be poetic.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.791
Where did you go that night?

12:30.542 --> 12:33.003
The night JP died,
you were gone when I woke up.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.758
You stopped calling, and you're not
answering any of my text messages.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.471
You once said that
you'd do anything for me.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.432
You think I killed him?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.310
I think people do crazy things
when they're in love.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.395
I'd do the same. I'd do anything for you.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.608
You're so full of shit.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.819
-No, I'm no-- I'm--
-Come on, Urs.

12:58.362 --> 13:01.532
You wouldn't even move into a house
that I wanted to rent for us.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.952
Now, you say you'd kill for me? Come on.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.495
I'm sorry.

13:07.162 --> 13:13.001
It repulsed me.
What you asked me to do, it repulsed me.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.087
I didn't ask you to do anything.

13:15.170 --> 13:19.174
We both know
what you wanted me to do that night.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.595
I had to leave that night

13:24.638 --> 13:27.641
because I couldn't bear lying beside you
for another minute.

13:29.977 --> 13:30.978
I'm sorry.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.648
It's over.

13:37.609 --> 13:38.652
Please.

13:41.572 --> 13:45.075
I need this to be over, Urs.

13:46.827 --> 13:47.744
Please.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.110
Michael, no.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.321
-No peeping. Think about it…
-Go!

14:22.404 --> 14:24.323
-Dad…
-Don't, Michael!

14:28.285 --> 14:30.996
Michael tried to soak me with the hose.
You'll be next.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.582
You all right? Do you want a cup of tea?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.685
Roger, is it? Matthew Claffin.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.104
Do you mind if I come inside?

14:59.358 --> 15:01.735
Yeah, okay.
Just go around to your left, yeah?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.127
-Please, sit down.
-Yeah. Thank you.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.462
Sorry about the mess.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.297
No, you're okay.

15:24.883 --> 15:29.763
So I'm dealing with the policy
of a local family, the Williams'.

15:29.847 --> 15:34.017
Just doing a bit of background work
before we pay out.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.603
It's standard procedure.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.649
So, you know the family?

15:41.149 --> 15:42.442
Yeah, I did.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.528
Not anymore?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.655
Well, he's dead, isn't he?

15:47.781 --> 15:48.866
He is.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.453
But not Grace and Blanaid.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.584
Yeah, well, it's too late now, isn't it?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.461
What's done is done.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.132
That man was the devil incarnate.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.635
He accused me of a crime so hateful.

16:08.719 --> 16:09.803
Which crime?

16:10.679 --> 16:13.140
Having an unnatural interest in children.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.393
I've got nothing but love for children,
but he set the tongues wagging!

16:16.476 --> 16:18.353
My church disowned me!

16:19.229 --> 16:22.691
My duties were taken from me!
My life has fallen apart!

16:23.692 --> 16:26.570
And all for sport. That's all it was.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.531
Just amusement to him.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.911
Can I ask you a question?

16:35.746 --> 16:39.374
Can you remember where you were
the night John Paul died?

16:41.919 --> 16:42.920
Yeah.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.507
I went up to his cabin
the night that he died.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.010
'Cause I knew I couldn't carry around

16:50.093 --> 16:52.930
all this hatred
that was inside me, you see?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.806
I knew I needed to forgive him.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.936
I knew I needed to get back
to the love, you see?

17:00.938 --> 17:05.776
You went to the cabin
and John Paul was there?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.113
Pay the woman's claim.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.657
It's the least she deserves

17:13.325 --> 17:16.869
after all these years spent
with that twisted bastard.

17:17.871 --> 17:22.917
I'll tell you what's unnatural,
the interest he had in his sisters-in-law.

17:23.502 --> 17:24.586
What do you mean?

17:27.005 --> 17:28.507
I'd like you to leave now, please.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.053
Sure.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.187
Mrs. Williams!

17:43.856 --> 17:44.898
Grace!

17:44.982 --> 17:46.233
Some news, I hope.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.570
-Yeah, well, sort of. Can I come in?
-No.

17:49.653 --> 17:52.614
Sorry, no, I have Blanaid's dinner
to get started, so…

17:53.115 --> 17:56.535
Okay, I'm just still a little fuzzy
on a couple of things

17:56.618 --> 17:58.287
I wanted to quickly go over.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.581
So, I went to that pub in Wicklow.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.293
Barmaid said she can't be sure
your husband was there or not.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.420
All I know
is he said he went to watch Harps play.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.089
And if that's what he said,
then that's what he would have done.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.591
Okay. She said Becka--

18:11.508 --> 18:14.261
your sister, Rebecca,
that she was there, though.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.098
So, not with you all as you said.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.351
She came late. She's always late.

18:21.435 --> 18:24.104
Your neighbor said
your husband accused him of pedophilia.

18:25.439 --> 18:29.234
He said he went to the cabin that night
to forgive him. Did you see him there?

18:30.444 --> 18:33.280
Your younger sister said
that he financially ruined her,

18:33.363 --> 18:35.324
and he was abusive to his own mother.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.912
He wasn't a popular man, was he?

20:06.665 --> 20:08.125
God's sake.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.630
Shit.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.219
For God's sake.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.939
Leave a message for Thomas Claffin.

21:55.357 --> 21:59.945
Thomas, Grace told me JP was going
to the pub to watch the match,

22:00.028 --> 22:02.531
but the match was the night after.
It was the Saturday.

22:03.073 --> 22:06.451
I just checked those tickets for Malcolm,
those fixtures are always on a Saturday.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.037
JP definitely lied to her.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.040
Why would he lie?

22:53.373 --> 22:55.167
Where the hell have you been?

22:58.295 --> 22:59.755
Oh, no, take your time, Urs.

22:59.838 --> 23:02.257
It's only our entire lives
on the line here.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.515
Ben didn't do it.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.977
What did he do with the pento?
Have you got it?

23:19.191 --> 23:20.484
How can you be sure he didn't?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.694
'Cause he ended it, Bibi, okay?
That's how.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.865
He wouldn't do that for me.
I don't know what I was thinking.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.994
I've ruined it all.

23:32.788 --> 23:33.956
Oh, Urs.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.043
Okay, if anyone in this room did it,
we need to say.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.337
I mean it.

23:40.838 --> 23:43.382
No one is gonna have
to deal with this alone.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.093
We'll close ranks, circle in.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.720
It's the only way we can all be protected.

23:51.974 --> 23:52.975
Urs.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.687
She was on her own all night.

23:57.271 --> 23:58.939
-Who's to say she didn't?
-'Cause I didn't.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.858
-Because she didn't.
-Okay.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.651
So, both of you get
automatically believed,

24:02.734 --> 24:06.238
-and I have to provide a bloody alibi?
-She didn't have someone else involved.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.073
She's a fucking psycho!

24:08.156 --> 24:12.035
I'm not the one who tried to kill someone
so my husband didn't discover my affair.

24:12.119 --> 24:14.329
-You f-- Bitch.
-Look, just stop! Okay? Just stop.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.416
-You're the psycho!
-Where were you, Becka?

24:17.499 --> 24:20.544
I need to know where you were that night.
Why was there mud on your shoes?

24:20.627 --> 24:23.839
I got hammered at the pub!
Miss fucking Marple.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.008
I was worried
you would do something reckless,

24:26.091 --> 24:29.303
-so I got pissed. You taught me well.
-Don't talk to her like that!

24:29.386 --> 24:31.054
What are you fighting about?

24:32.848 --> 24:35.559
Nothing. Just politics.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.728
Ever since John Paul died,

24:37.811 --> 24:40.063
whenever I walk into the room,
you stop talking.

24:40.689 --> 24:41.857
No, we don't!

24:41.940 --> 24:43.525
What's happened, Grace? You okay?

24:44.443 --> 24:45.903
They did a postmortem on John Paul.

24:46.612 --> 24:49.364
My signature is on this
like I agreed to it.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.035
-Those dirty bastards.
-Shut up.

24:54.328 --> 24:55.329
Oh, my God.

24:57.664 --> 25:01.627
You knew about it.
You knew about the postmortem.

25:04.338 --> 25:06.507
Why did they exhume John Paul's body?

25:13.931 --> 25:15.599
Because they think he was murdered.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.436
And they think
it was one of us who did it.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.024
One of you?

25:25.901 --> 25:27.361
Why would they think that?

25:30.072 --> 25:32.824
Because they think
we all had reason to kill him.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.161
-And because--
-No! Just--

25:36.245 --> 25:37.579
Stop lying to her!

25:40.457 --> 25:42.042
Because we may not have killed him…

25:44.419 --> 25:46.004
Jesus, we tried.

25:46.505 --> 25:49.466
What are you talking about?
What does that mean? "We tried"?

25:49.550 --> 25:53.262
We wanted John Paul dead, Gracie.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.558
We were doing it for you.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.227
We wanted to save you.

26:03.397 --> 26:04.982
We wanted you and Blanaid to be free.

26:10.445 --> 26:11.738
Gracie.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.710
I'm so sorry.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.965
I'm so, so sorry.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.556
-There you go.
-It was my birthday.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.933
We were having a lovely evening…

26:44.396 --> 26:45.397
Come on, you.

26:52.029 --> 26:54.114
These stairs are slippery, Mammy.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.490
Very slippery.

26:56.325 --> 26:58.619
We need to do something
about these stairs.

26:59.494 --> 27:02.206
-What are you looking for, honey?
-Jam-jams.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.751
You could go without them, maybe?

27:07.211 --> 27:08.545
Just for tonight.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.216
That tickles, Mam.

27:13.342 --> 27:14.885
Well, then…

27:14.968 --> 27:17.304
I'll just have to be more careful,
won't I?

27:39.284 --> 27:41.787
Tell me it's just you and me.

27:44.498 --> 27:45.832
Yeah.

29:06.038 --> 29:07.039
Hey.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.126
Are you trying to break my neck?
Don't do that.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.295
-John Paul.
-No, I'm--

29:14.838 --> 29:15.923
I'm not doing this now.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.970
Here we go, the dramatic tear fall.

29:25.182 --> 29:27.726
I just wanted to kiss you, baby.
I just want--

29:27.809 --> 29:30.646
No, you don't just want to kiss, Grace.

29:30.729 --> 29:33.857
You always want something more.
The pressure you put on me is…

29:36.443 --> 29:39.446
Ursula says it's so normal. Y--

29:41.490 --> 29:44.910
There are loads of reasons for impotence,
like--

29:44.993 --> 29:47.871
Have you talked to your sisters
about my cock?

29:49.540 --> 29:50.749
Ursula's a nurse.

29:51.542 --> 29:52.918
-She's used to talking about--
-She's a whore!

29:53.001 --> 29:54.002
I beg your pardon?

29:56.255 --> 29:59.550
Your sisters are poison, Grace.
And they poison your mind.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.052
Why do you keep talking about my sisters?

30:02.928 --> 30:07.432
-I'm just trying to help fix a problem.
-Who are you to fix anything anyway?

30:07.516 --> 30:08.809
I mean, you're nothing.

30:08.892 --> 30:12.187
You're a fly on a wall. You're a shadow.

30:12.271 --> 30:16.191
If I turn out that light right now,
you wouldn't even exist.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.651
You wanna try it?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.780
You wanna try that? See what happens?

30:22.281 --> 30:23.282
Here we go.

30:23.907 --> 30:28.453
Hello? Mammy? Where's Mammy?
Has anyone seen Mammy?

30:29.621 --> 30:31.331
See? You're not even a shadow anymore.

30:34.793 --> 30:35.794
There you are.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.088
You're back. Mammy's back.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.048
You exist again.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.388
Where are you going? I dare you to say it.

30:46.889 --> 30:49.141
I'm going to my sisters.

30:49.766 --> 30:53.896
You just won't see it, will you?
Your sisters are the problem!

30:53.979 --> 30:55.731
They're the only ones
who actually care about me.

30:55.814 --> 30:58.275
Well, they will do anything
to pull us apart.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.527
That's how much they care about you.

31:00.611 --> 31:01.945
-Do you wanna talk about this?
-No!

31:02.029 --> 31:04.573
Do you want to know why
I have issues getting it up with you?

31:07.701 --> 31:10.287
Because one of
your precious sisters seduced me,

31:11.330 --> 31:12.372
that's why.

31:12.456 --> 31:13.665
What are you talking about?

31:14.666 --> 31:16.752
Seduced you? What does that even mean?

31:18.754 --> 31:20.297
When I was drunk.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.924
Which sister, John Paul? Who?

31:23.800 --> 31:24.718
Eva.

31:25.469 --> 31:26.553
Eva?

31:26.637 --> 31:27.638
Yes.

31:29.264 --> 31:31.600
No, she wouldn't. I don't--

31:34.061 --> 31:36.480
You had sex with Eva?

31:36.563 --> 31:39.358
Grace, that was not sex.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.319
That was a trap.

31:43.070 --> 31:44.071
When?

31:44.780 --> 31:46.573
Years ago. Ten years ago.

31:47.699 --> 31:50.702
That Ciaran fellow, he'd passed out,
you'd fallen asleep,

31:50.786 --> 31:53.956
and she came onto me.

31:54.665 --> 31:58.252
And I was out of my mind drunk,
and I think I thought it was you,

31:58.335 --> 32:00.003
and then she tricked me, and it--

32:01.588 --> 32:05.384
It's messed me up.
It's messed me up ever since.

32:06.635 --> 32:11.139
So it was when
we came up here for my birthday?

32:12.140 --> 32:14.518
And she's even tried to blame me
for what happened after.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.144
For what?

32:17.646 --> 32:19.356
-The miscarriage?
-Yes.

32:21.275 --> 32:23.735
But I was with her when that happened.
She was destroyed.

32:23.819 --> 32:26.530
Yeah, well, whatever happened,
it was her fault.

32:27.489 --> 32:31.743
She was filthy drunk, Grace.
That's how you lose a baby.

32:35.539 --> 32:36.790
What did you do?

32:36.874 --> 32:37.875
What?

32:39.042 --> 32:40.169
What did you make her do?

32:40.961 --> 32:41.962
Look at me!

32:42.045 --> 32:44.089
Don't you fucking scream at me!

32:45.174 --> 32:46.216
Don't!

32:47.092 --> 32:50.137
It was her! Your sister!

32:50.721 --> 32:51.889
You're a liar.

32:56.810 --> 33:01.565
She's the liar here. She blamed me.

33:02.149 --> 33:06.653
She even tried to say that I raped her
'cause she was so disgusted with herself.

33:07.863 --> 33:09.406
Did you rape her, John Paul?

33:09.489 --> 33:14.661
Did I rape her? No.
You don't rape women like that.

33:19.625 --> 33:22.169
-Get off me! You liar!
-Mammy. Ma--

33:22.252 --> 33:24.838
Everything you do,
everything we have is a lie!

33:27.007 --> 33:30.802
You ruined her life, you fucking monster!

34:05.170 --> 34:06.255
Grace.

34:47.254 --> 34:48.797
You blamed me!

34:50.424 --> 34:52.467
You made me think it was me!

34:58.682 --> 35:01.310
You fucking monster.

35:32.174 --> 35:33.800
I didn't do what he said I did.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.844
-Course you didn't.
-I didn't do it.

35:38.055 --> 35:40.599
I re-- I was drunk. I was.

35:40.682 --> 35:44.061
And I really thought, you know,
I really thought, "Did I do something?"

35:44.144 --> 35:45.145
But…

35:45.229 --> 35:47.356
I remember going to the bathroom.

35:48.565 --> 35:51.068
And I remember
not being able to lock the door.

35:51.151 --> 35:54.029
And I passed out,
or I couldn't get up, or something,

35:54.112 --> 35:57.157
and then I looked up, and he was there.

35:58.408 --> 35:59.785
And he was looking down at me.

36:00.536 --> 36:02.996
And I remember I smiled at him, but just--

36:04.122 --> 36:05.749
Thought he was trying to help me.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.670
But he--

36:13.924 --> 36:15.884
-But I didn't do anything. I didn't.
-No.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.470
I couldn't stop him

36:18.554 --> 36:21.056
because I just-- I-- because I couldn't.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.307
Listen to me.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.185
I know that he raped you.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.359
I didn't know I was pregnant.

36:35.779 --> 36:38.991
I didn't even think I could get so…

36:40.576 --> 36:43.745
But when I miscarried, I tho--
I just thought it was a punishment for it.

36:49.543 --> 36:50.544
Don't.

36:56.008 --> 36:57.509
I'm sorry.

38:38.110 --> 38:42.114
Whatever you're blaming yourself for,
it's not your fault.

38:43.532 --> 38:44.825
Either of you.

38:52.624 --> 38:53.834
How did you…

38:56.795 --> 38:59.339
How did you know what to do with his body?

40:44.820 --> 40:46.572
You buried him in the murder weapon.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.992
-How do you mean?
-His pajamas.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.035
Sorry.

40:52.536 --> 40:55.414
How did you keep it to yourself
for so long, Gracie?

41:03.505 --> 41:06.008
Why did you never tell me what happened?

41:06.592 --> 41:10.929
I was going to. I was. I was
going to tell you the next morning, just…

41:12.472 --> 41:14.391
the moment I didn't, I knew I never would.

41:18.353 --> 41:19.521
It's Matt.

41:21.231 --> 41:22.232
Answer it.

41:25.819 --> 41:26.820
Hello?

41:27.321 --> 41:28.655
I need to see you.

41:30.324 --> 41:31.325
That's nice.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.828
I'm a bit busy now.

41:34.912 --> 41:37.831
I've been to the cabin in Wicklow.
I know what happened to JP.

41:39.208 --> 41:40.542
-Becka?
-Wait…

41:53.263 --> 41:54.264
Well?

41:58.143 --> 41:59.353
What did he say?

41:59.436 --> 42:02.314
He was at the cabin.
He wants to meet up with me.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.067
So what does he know?

42:06.443 --> 42:08.237
I guess that's what I'll find out.

42:11.823 --> 42:14.409
I can't go to prison. I can't do that.
I can't--

42:14.493 --> 42:16.870
I can't leave Blanaid on her own.
I can't do that.

42:16.954 --> 42:18.789
For God's sake,
surely we just explain what he did.

42:19.498 --> 42:20.916
The rape, the abuse.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.543
I mean, he's pushed us all over the edge.

42:22.626 --> 42:24.711
Yeah, let's try that,
'cause that always works for women.

42:24.795 --> 42:27.130
-I--
-Where you going?

42:27.214 --> 42:29.299
I have to take Blanaid to her swimming.

42:30.092 --> 42:32.344
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

42:32.427 --> 42:34.221
What?
You think if we sit here long enough,

42:34.304 --> 42:37.349
we're just gonna figure it out
like a bloody crossword puzzle?

42:38.976 --> 42:42.312
I have to be a mother to my daughter
for as long as I can be.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.231
Okay. You can go.

42:45.232 --> 42:46.775
-It's okay.
-You can go.

42:48.777 --> 42:50.946
-Love you, Gracie.
-I love you too.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.030
I love you.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.199
We're here, okay?

43:04.501 --> 43:05.794
I have to go meet Matt, so…

43:05.878 --> 43:07.588
Yeah. I'm gonna come with you.

43:08.088 --> 43:09.464
Can you just let me do this?

43:13.427 --> 43:14.469
Okay.

43:21.810 --> 43:23.103
She took your jacket.

43:24.021 --> 43:25.022
I know.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.371
-Whatever you're thinking--
-Becka.

43:41.455 --> 43:42.456
It was me.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.960
I killed him. I did it.

43:47.044 --> 43:48.795
I know why you're saying that.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.883
-And I also know that you're lying.
-I did it, Matt.

43:56.678 --> 43:58.972
Why are you punishing yourself like this?

43:59.932 --> 44:01.934
If I mean anything to you…

44:03.519 --> 44:06.104
then keep what you found out to yourself.
Please.

44:06.188 --> 44:08.524
You're asking me to choose you
over my brother.

44:08.607 --> 44:09.900
He was an abuser.

44:10.943 --> 44:13.278
He was a rapist. He raped my sister.

44:13.362 --> 44:17.574
-He ruined our lives.
-And Grace killed him. She murdered him.

44:18.784 --> 44:20.244
You and your sisters covered it up.

44:25.916 --> 44:28.001
My mouth is so dry. I can't swallow.

44:30.796 --> 44:32.214
I need a drink or something.

44:39.263 --> 44:40.347
Do you…

44:42.349 --> 44:45.185
Do you want a hot-water bottle, or--

44:45.269 --> 44:46.270
Why?

44:48.981 --> 44:49.982
Well…

44:51.567 --> 44:53.694
I just thought with--

44:55.696 --> 44:58.740
Yeah, well, it was ten years ago.

44:59.324 --> 45:03.078
I mean, hot-water bottles are great,
but that might be a stretch.

45:06.874 --> 45:09.918
I can't find my wash-bag.
I thought I left it on the table.

45:11.044 --> 45:12.379
It has the pento in it.

45:12.462 --> 45:13.672
Did you do something with it?

45:14.423 --> 45:16.466
Yeah, Ursula. I put it on my cornflakes.

45:17.134 --> 45:18.135
Well, did you take it?

45:18.218 --> 45:20.053
No. What?

45:23.390 --> 45:24.474
Oh, my God.

45:26.351 --> 45:28.604
Becka, I'm on my way to you now.

45:28.687 --> 45:31.023
Please don't do anything stupid.

45:31.106 --> 45:31.982
Get in the back.

45:32.065 --> 45:33.942
-Come on.
-Drive, Eva!

45:34.026 --> 45:35.319
I am!

45:35.402 --> 45:38.280
-Drive!
-Just hand her the bloody seat belt.

45:54.546 --> 45:56.757
Shit.

45:58.175 --> 45:59.218
Shit.

46:26.286 --> 46:27.496
I love you.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.669
You shouldn't say
something that you don't mean.

46:33.752 --> 46:35.045
But I do.

46:37.548 --> 46:39.007
I love you. That's the truth.

46:44.721 --> 46:45.806
I'm sorry, Becka.

47:18.505 --> 47:20.048
Just go. Please.

47:40.569 --> 47:42.654
Oh, my God, I'm stuck!

47:44.072 --> 47:46.408
-Wait!
-No, don't wait!

47:46.491 --> 47:47.492
Come on!

47:47.576 --> 47:49.369
-Press the button!
-I'm pressing it!

47:53.874 --> 47:56.793
Becka. What are you doing?

47:57.753 --> 48:00.839
What the fuck?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

48:00.923 --> 48:04.384
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

48:04.468 --> 48:08.472
-I couldn't do it.
-Stop. It's okay.

48:09.056 --> 48:10.307
I killed her.

48:11.558 --> 48:12.643
Listen. Listen to me.

48:12.726 --> 48:15.229
Whatever happens next,
you have to forgive yourself, Becka.

48:15.312 --> 48:17.689
You have to. You have to forgive yourself.

48:18.774 --> 48:20.442
It's okay. She's okay.

48:20.526 --> 48:22.027
Yeah, well, she won't be in a minute.

48:22.110 --> 48:23.987
You almost gave us a heart attack!

48:24.071 --> 48:26.782
Where is he? Becka, where has he gone?

48:29.785 --> 48:31.995
He knows Grace killed him
and thinks we covered it up.

48:33.830 --> 48:34.831
Well…

48:35.958 --> 48:38.085
Well, maybe there's a way around this.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.087
Diminished responsibility, or--

48:40.170 --> 48:42.631
Whatever happens to Grace,
we covered up a murder…

48:44.675 --> 48:47.302
I think that's frowned on
in certain circles.

48:48.136 --> 48:50.430
Yeah, you know what else is frowned on
in certain circles?

48:51.431 --> 48:54.434
Faking signatures.
Illegally exhuming bodies.

48:54.935 --> 48:57.729
All we tried to do
was kill that fucker a few times.

48:57.813 --> 48:58.814
Bibi…

49:05.028 --> 49:06.280
So, what are you gonna do?

49:46.570 --> 49:47.779
Fuck!

51:34.219 --> 51:38.223
I've a daughter. I'm a father, Matt.
I'm a daddy.

51:42.978 --> 51:44.062
How are the girls?

51:44.646 --> 51:46.273
Yeah,
the little one's out of intensive care,

51:46.773 --> 51:50.027
and Theresa asked me to go to AbraKebabra
to get an all-meat kebab,

51:50.110 --> 51:51.695
so that's a good sign. I think.

51:52.321 --> 51:53.322
Could be ominous.

51:53.989 --> 51:55.991
We don't have to pay out
the Williams claim, Tom.

51:57.117 --> 51:58.911
What? What do you mean?

52:00.495 --> 52:04.291
Grace WIlliams. She's withdrawn the claim.

52:06.710 --> 52:08.879
-Well, how the hell did you do that, Matt?
-It doesn't matter.

52:08.962 --> 52:10.672
It does matter!
Well, of course, it matters!

52:10.756 --> 52:12.633
You had your secrets, okay?

52:12.716 --> 52:15.093
Didn't seem to bother you
that I was in the dark.

52:15.177 --> 52:19.598
In fact, I'm pretty sure you said
it was for my own good. Well, so is this.

52:24.269 --> 52:26.522
You clever little bastard.

52:40.953 --> 52:42.955
Blanaid, you look beautiful.

52:44.373 --> 52:45.791
Maybe put on a coat, though?

52:45.874 --> 52:47.000
See you later, Mam.

52:48.544 --> 52:49.878
Text me.

52:49.962 --> 52:51.129
Mam, I'll see you later.

52:53.757 --> 52:54.925
Bla, I love you.

53:04.142 --> 53:05.352
I love you too, Mam.

53:07.688 --> 53:08.689
Have fun.

53:10.023 --> 53:12.067
-Bla, hurry up!
-Coming!

53:23.787 --> 53:25.747
Blink of an eye and she's all grown up.

53:28.083 --> 53:30.711
Well, a lot has happened.
That's sure to change you.

53:33.672 --> 53:34.798
I see you're moving on.

53:35.299 --> 53:38.218
We have no choice.
Can't afford to stay here.

53:38.802 --> 53:42.222
We're gonna live with Eva. A widow
and a spinster, living it up.

53:45.684 --> 53:46.977
Before we leave, I wanted to--

53:47.060 --> 53:49.938
Please. Grace, don't.

53:50.022 --> 53:52.983
I never did thank you for what you did.

53:53.483 --> 53:55.068
You can't thank me for that.

53:55.152 --> 53:57.321
If I had opened my eyes
to what was going on,

53:57.404 --> 53:59.406
if I'd just seen what he was doing to you,

53:59.990 --> 54:01.742
it would never have come to that.

54:03.619 --> 54:05.370
I wish I hadn't asked you for your help…

54:09.082 --> 54:10.209
but what you did,

54:11.877 --> 54:13.170
that was a good thing.

54:26.350 --> 54:27.726
Don't forget about me.

54:28.519 --> 54:29.728
I won't.

55:08.433 --> 55:09.852
Bring your own then!

55:20.696 --> 55:23.490
Are you trying to will
that dick in the Speedo's to fall in?

55:25.033 --> 55:26.994
No. I will now, though.

55:29.079 --> 55:30.080
You all right?

55:32.583 --> 55:34.459
Hola, chicas!

55:34.543 --> 55:36.003
-Hola!
-Hello.

55:36.086 --> 55:37.087
Finally.

55:37.171 --> 55:39.548
-Where have you been?
-Sorry, I had a business meeting.

55:39.631 --> 55:40.841
-Dirt bird.
-Shut up.

55:41.633 --> 55:42.926
All right, you mad cow.

55:43.010 --> 55:44.636
All right, you mad bitch.

55:45.220 --> 55:47.181
Man, I missed that laugh.

55:48.056 --> 55:49.600
I didn't realize how much.

55:51.852 --> 55:54.313
You're only as happy
as your unhappiest child.

55:55.939 --> 55:57.149
And she's grand now.

55:59.234 --> 56:02.905
-Oi! Are we getting in or what?
-Go on then.

56:03.488 --> 56:05.908
Yes! Come on. Took her time.

56:08.327 --> 56:10.579
God. A voluntary hug.

56:16.502 --> 56:17.669
Thank you, Gracie.

56:19.588 --> 56:22.883
Look at you. Bloody wet suit.

56:23.425 --> 56:25.010
-Bitch.
-I came prepared!

56:46.448 --> 56:49.117
-Come on, Grace!
-Get in! Come on!

56:49.201 --> 56:51.411
-Come on!
-Get in!

56:51.495 --> 56:53.747
-Oi!
-Come on!

56:54.540 --> 56:56.083
Come on, Grace! Do it!

56:56.166 --> 56:57.501
What are you waiting for?

56:57.584 --> 56:59.253
-Get in!
-Come on, Grace.
