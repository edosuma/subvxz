00:33.900 --> 00:37.349
- I'm sorry, lover. Did I wake you?
- I didn't know you were still here.

00:37.517 --> 00:41.293
- I can't figure out these locks.
- Don't do that. Let me.

00:51.793 --> 00:53.004
Thanks.

00:53.137 --> 00:57.033
Hey, hey, hey...
You're not driving, are you?

00:57.203 --> 01:01.939
- Is that an invitation to stay?
- No. I'll call you a cab.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.435
Leave my car all the way over here?

01:04.629 --> 01:08.853
No, I swear, officer. I can walk
the line, and I can touch my nose.

01:09.046 --> 01:13.804
- You can pick up your car whenever.
- I can drink a pot of coffee.

01:15.768 --> 01:18.256
I'll drive you. Hang on.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.326
Gee, they say chivalry's dead.

01:22.490 --> 01:24.498
- Good morning, boys.
- It's not good.

01:24.635 --> 01:29.077
I brought doughnuts.
You guys catch the game last night?

01:29.245 --> 01:32.028
Conway went 70 yards
for the touchdown. It was mayhem.

01:32.221 --> 01:34.677
Somebody remind me
why I picked surgery?

01:34.878 --> 01:37.148
For a scut zombie,
you're looking very crisp.

01:37.311 --> 01:41.884
Part of the joy of moving back home.
Rena insists on using extra starch.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.225
- Rena?
- The maid?

01:43.393 --> 01:47.518
My place burned down.
I've been living out of a suitcase.

01:47.682 --> 01:49.243
A Louis Vuitton suitcase.

01:49.411 --> 01:53.438
Dress down for the plumbing accident
in 2. He's very stinky.

01:53.604 --> 01:55.841
- Thanks for the carbs.
- Yo.

01:56.004 --> 01:59.300
- Your parents live on Oak Brook?
- Oh, don't start.

01:59.430 --> 02:01.820
I'm just saying, I've got an extra bed
in my place.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.806
It's two minutes away. Got all the
Cup o' Ramen you can eat.

02:04.967 --> 02:08.678
And you don't have to worry about
the help over-starching your shirts.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.453
- Are you serious?
- It's time to leave the nest.

02:12.618 --> 02:16.099
- That's great. Thanks.
- I'll see you at the firm conference.

02:17.451 --> 02:20.169
Firm conference?
That's not next week?

02:20.332 --> 02:23.846
Pancreatectomy lecture by Dr. Benton,
assisted by John Carter.

02:24.013 --> 02:27.843
Oh, my God! Benton's slides were
in the fire. They're toast.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.607
Why couldn't I have been home?

02:29.743 --> 02:33.672
I could've had smoke inhalation and be
sucking air through a nice ET tube.

02:34.992 --> 02:37.327
Where's the fire?

02:38.705 --> 02:42.961
- I'm just trying to get back to bed.
- Me too.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.695
Oh, damn it!

02:52.853 --> 02:55.920
I forgot my watch and stuff at your
place. Can we go back, please?

02:56.087 --> 02:58.706
You know, I'll send it to you. Okay?

03:05.209 --> 03:08.439
Oh! Do you mind? I have a headache.

03:10.843 --> 03:12.535
I'm not surprised.

03:16.508 --> 03:18.069
Oh, come on! I'm not in the mood.

03:19.101 --> 03:22.680
Don't, don't. Just don't mess
around with me right now.

03:22.846 --> 03:25.662
If you're gonna throw up,
just lean out of the window.

03:26.496 --> 03:28.056
You all right? Hey!

03:29.089 --> 03:31.675
Hey, hey, hey! Are you...?

03:32.418 --> 03:34.720
Hang on! Hang on!

03:34.882 --> 03:38.778
- Have a doughnut if you want one.
- No, thanks. Weaver's looking for you.

03:38.979 --> 03:40.987
Yeah. It takes a while to get in
from the D-Iot.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.814
- Did you get your car back?
- I will.

03:43.012 --> 03:44.955
I need some help here!
She's in status!

03:45.157 --> 03:49.414
I don't know if she's an epileptic
or if it's what she drank.

03:49.574 --> 03:51.779
Give me 4 mgs of Ativan
and an amp of D50.

03:51.943 --> 03:53.405
Doyle, clear Trauma 2.

03:53.576 --> 03:55.169
- Tonic-clonic seizure.
- Any history?

03:55.336 --> 03:59.680
Give me a CBC, Chem-20, blood glucose,
tox screen and a blood alcohol.

03:59.850 --> 04:03.014
- Where did you find her, Doug?
- My house.

04:03.178 --> 04:05.350
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

04:54.938 --> 04:59.030
- 70 over 40. Pressure's still dropping.
- Temp's up to 105.

04:59.195 --> 05:02.971
Seizing's burning her up. Get cooling
blankets before her brain fries.

05:03.133 --> 05:07.673
- Morning, folks. What's the word?
- We've got a Jane Doe in status.

05:07.805 --> 05:10.621
- Load her up with Dilantin?
- She's maxed out on the benzos.

05:10.782 --> 05:14.231
Came in 30 minutes ago.
Seizure history and meds unknown.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.637
- Meningitis?
- Doug thinks she's been drinking.

05:16.833 --> 05:20.249
- I thought you weren't on until noon.
- I'm not. She's with me.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.523
- Temp's 106.2.
- She's hyperthermic.

05:22.690 --> 05:27.296
Alert Neuro and Anesthesiology.
And bring in a two-channel EEG.

05:27.459 --> 05:31.716
We need pentobarbital,
100 mgs over two minutes.

05:31.877 --> 05:34.365
- And an intubation tray.
- Aren't you jumping the gun?

05:34.534 --> 05:37.732
She's been seizing for a half-hour.
You have a better suggestion?

05:37.895 --> 05:41.125
- Her blood gas is back. PH is 7.1.
- She's acidotic.

05:41.256 --> 05:45.448
Let's put her in a coma.
Kerry, you want to help me intubate?

05:45.609 --> 05:47.497
A 7.5 ET tube.

05:47.690 --> 05:51.465
I'll go to the car and look for
a registration or I.D. Or something.

05:51.659 --> 05:56.068
Another modification to the system
will be a return to professionalism.

05:56.236 --> 05:58.277
We're surgeons. Let's look like it.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.675
From here on out, I'm instituting
a jacket-and-tie policy...

06:01.838 --> 06:04.905
...for all surgeons outside the O.R.

06:05.071 --> 06:10.222
Except for the ladies on staff,
who I trust will dress appropriately.

06:13.009 --> 06:15.246
As I was saying...

06:16.754 --> 06:18.315
Well, so much for the do's and don'ts.

06:18.483 --> 06:24.148
We're still woefully short on surgical
volunteers for the Healthmobile.

06:24.309 --> 06:26.164
If we don't see some names
on that list ASAP...

06:26.326 --> 06:29.742
Carter, you're late.
I had to set up the projector...

06:29.911 --> 06:32.977
You can run a projector, can't you?
Damn, it's starting.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.717
- A paper on total pancreatectomy
versus the Whipple procedure...

06:37.881 --> 06:41.810
...in the palliative treatment of
pancreatic carcinoma. Dr. Benton.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.742
Thank you, Dr. Anspaugh.

06:46.908 --> 06:51.666
I'm gonna be talking today about
the use of the Whipple procedure...

06:51.869 --> 06:54.804
...in lieu of total pancreatectomy...

06:55.006 --> 06:59.709
...which is, I guess,
what Dr. Anspaugh just said.

06:59.903 --> 07:01.943
Lights, please.

07:06.658 --> 07:10.336
Pancreatectomy removes the potential
for recurrence...

07:10.499 --> 07:12.026
...due to multifocal disease...

07:12.195 --> 07:15.491
...and avoids pancreatojejunostomy.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.987
Now, slide, please.

07:18.117 --> 07:22.591
If you observe here, the attendant
risk of leakage is the...

07:28.296 --> 07:30.599
Path slide one, please!

07:30.761 --> 07:33.096
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

07:35.146 --> 07:38.856
- What were you trying to tell me?
- Can I speak to you alone?

07:39.019 --> 07:43.078
- Is there a problem, Dr. Benton?
- No, not at all, Dr. Anspaugh.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.154
- Carter, put in the damn slide.
- I can't.

07:45.325 --> 07:48.076
My apartment burned down.
I lost the pathology slides.

07:50.798 --> 07:52.325
The tables?

07:52.495 --> 07:54.383
- The operative photographs?
- Those too.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.312
- Looks like she's stabilizing.
- No spikes.

08:06.483 --> 08:10.958
- I'm gonna see what's keeping Neuro.
- Could I have a minute?

08:15.126 --> 08:19.404
In all the commotion, you may not
remember our new pilot study.

08:19.543 --> 08:21.966
The medical/surgical division of duty.

08:22.136 --> 08:26.130
One Attending gets real emergencies,
the other hands out aspirin?

08:26.297 --> 08:31.033
One takes medical cases, one takes
surgical. You wanted surgical?

08:31.195 --> 08:33.912
I wanted neither,
because I think it's a bad idea.

08:34.075 --> 08:38.681
Dr. Anspaugh approved it. Since you
took over the seizure patient...

08:38.845 --> 08:42.424
- Okay, why don't you take surgical...
- She's seizing!

08:42.590 --> 08:45.526
She's all yours. Report to him.

08:45.695 --> 08:50.431
All right. Looks like you and I are
handling all the medical cases today.

08:50.592 --> 08:53.724
- Only medical?
- That's the grand plan.

08:54.626 --> 08:59.232
- We thought she was stabilized.
- Okay. Six of Pavulon.

08:59.428 --> 09:02.178
- We're gonna paralyze her?
- Yes. Do you know why?

09:02.340 --> 09:05.505
- Because it's her only chance?
- That's right.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.318
Hey, girl. You missed all the drama.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.158
- Dr. Ross brought in a lady in status.
- Oh, yeah?

09:46.321 --> 09:50.513
- Are you okay?
- Just autumn. My allergies go crazy.

09:59.061 --> 10:02.510
Dr. Benton, I just want to apologize
again for the slides.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.336
- Did you replace them?
- Not yet.

10:04.534 --> 10:10.450
Dr. Anspaugh was kind enough
to reschedule for tomorrow morning.

10:10.616 --> 10:12.472
- Is there a chance...?
- Bye, Carter.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.301
Oh, the infamous Dr. Carter.

10:17.466 --> 10:20.402
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Abby Keaton.

10:20.571 --> 10:24.347
Pleased to meet you.
This morning was totally my fault.

10:24.508 --> 10:27.641
- It was a godsend. May I join you?
- Oh, yeah, please.

10:27.806 --> 10:30.621
No offense, Peter... Oh, thank you.

10:30.751 --> 10:33.173
No offense,
I love a nice, juicy gut lecture...

10:33.343 --> 10:37.851
...but your intern bought me
an extra half-hour for my dictations.

10:38.048 --> 10:40.951
- What did you think of Laura-Lee?
- Who?

10:41.154 --> 10:45.694
Are you so busy running the projector
that you can't follow up on cases?

10:45.859 --> 10:50.334
The film showed a dilated cecum,
and she's at risk of perfing.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.850
She's in 203. Why don't you two
go down and meet her?

10:54.021 --> 10:57.121
Answer her mother's questions,
and then bring her to the O.R.

10:57.287 --> 11:00.321
- I can do it myself.
- Bring Dr. Carter along.

11:00.455 --> 11:03.620
I guarantee it'll be
a real learning experience.

11:15.724 --> 11:17.383
Excuse me. Ambulance zone.

11:17.549 --> 11:21.063
Oh, good morning, Dr. Ross. Would
you mind moving the car, please?

11:21.230 --> 11:23.980
- Sir?
- Yep.

11:27.152 --> 11:30.895
- How's Dr. Ross' friend?
- "Friend" may be overstating it.

11:31.056 --> 11:34.254
You know, I don't think
it's any of our business.

11:40.563 --> 11:43.182
- Her name's Nadine Wilkes.
- Doug, Doug...

11:43.381 --> 11:45.203
...she's dead.

12:08.956 --> 12:13.879
- I thought you'd gone home.
- My shift starts in five minutes.

12:14.077 --> 12:16.893
I just thought you wouldn't be up
for working today.

12:18.975 --> 12:21.015
I feel bad for what happened to her.

12:21.184 --> 12:23.770
But if you're suggesting
I'm responsible...

12:23.936 --> 12:27.515
No, I just thought you were upset.
I guess not.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.023
I'm confused, Mark.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.339
Is it a big shock that I was intimate
with someone less than a soul mate?

12:34.499 --> 12:37.467
Doug, you didn't even know her name.

12:39.813 --> 12:43.360
Tox screen came back. Did you know
she'd test positive for cocaine?

12:43.558 --> 12:47.782
- No. Do you think I'd withhold that?
- I hope not.

12:48.839 --> 12:51.328
That's right. No.

12:51.497 --> 12:53.919
You were together all night.
She tested positive.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.741
- Are you asking if I did cocaine?
- Should I ask?

12:56.906 --> 13:00.136
You want me to piss in that mug?
Would that satisfy you?

13:00.300 --> 13:01.926
- Use a specimen cup.
- You want to watch?

13:02.092 --> 13:03.848
Just send it to the lab.

13:10.863 --> 13:13.319
We've got a 3-year-old
who drank shampoo.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.587
- You want me to wait for Doug?
- No, I'll handle it.

13:17.904 --> 13:20.393
- Doug lives his own life.
- That's the problem.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.627
I'm just saying
we can't live it for him.

13:24.947 --> 13:28.941
I think Dr. Keaton was inviting me
to do the colostomy with you.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.939
She doesn't know how busy you're
gonna be at the photo lab.

13:33.109 --> 13:35.281
Screw you! You can't make me.

13:38.422 --> 13:40.310
- Get out of my way, Mom!
- I'm Dr. Benton.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.118
- I'm out of here!
- You're having a major operation.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.420
The hell I am! I'm gone!

13:46.585 --> 13:50.034
Look, hold on. What is this?
Do you want to die? Is that it?

13:50.234 --> 13:53.203
- I'd make a good-Iooking corpse.
- I'd want to die too.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.313
You're gonna, if you don't
get out of my way!

13:55.516 --> 13:57.458
If I went to Proviso West...

13:57.628 --> 14:01.426
...I'd rather be 6 feet under
before a championship game.

14:01.598 --> 14:03.256
We're semifinalists this year,
lame-o.

14:03.422 --> 14:06.489
Last time I checked,
you had a semi-backfield.

14:06.655 --> 14:10.268
You should start some of your
cheerleaders. They look tough enough.

14:16.642 --> 14:19.709
Okay. Mom, okay.
Doc Magoo's at 5:00.

14:19.907 --> 14:23.170
No disrespect, E-Ray,
but I'm looking for a welding class.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.372
I can't see myself in genie pants.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.389
It's a simple means
to stress reduction and serenity.

14:28.550 --> 14:30.012
Whatever it is, sign me up.

14:30.182 --> 14:32.703
- You couldn't cancel?
- No, something's on her mind.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.425
Are you interested in my yoga class?

14:35.591 --> 14:38.626
Is there a mantra that'll get me
through dinner with my mother?

14:38.793 --> 14:41.641
You'd have to take my intro class
in preparation.

14:41.801 --> 14:44.552
Thursday nights
at Malcolm X Community College.

14:44.682 --> 14:47.978
- What's my old alma mater coming to?
- You went to Malcolm X?

14:48.140 --> 14:52.331
My first year. They got a very
prestigious pre-med night school!

14:52.525 --> 14:55.242
- Wait a minute.
- What?

14:55.405 --> 14:59.913
See there? Bio I, organic chemistry,
physics. All your basics.

15:00.079 --> 15:01.967
You got a problem with that?

15:02.127 --> 15:06.089
- Jerry?
- A 12-year-old GSW is coming in.

15:06.257 --> 15:08.975
Put this in Mark's box.
Make sure he sees it.

15:09.138 --> 15:11.986
Has anybody run a search
for Nadine Wilkes' medical records?

15:12.147 --> 15:17.134
- She's never been a patient here.
- We ought to try countywide.

15:17.269 --> 15:20.117
Won't the autopsy reveal
any preexisting conditions?

15:20.277 --> 15:24.883
- Probably, but it's worth a shot.
- Sure. E-Ray can help you.

15:25.078 --> 15:26.966
Dr. Ross, that gunshot wound is in.

15:27.895 --> 15:32.436
12-year-old GSW to the chest,
BP 50 palp, pulse 140, thready, weak.

15:32.601 --> 15:34.511
- Any I.D.?
- Street name's Shamrock.

15:34.681 --> 15:38.425
Usually he's on the other side of
the piece, but the owner drew faster.

15:38.587 --> 15:42.232
- He looks like a baby.
- Wait till you talk to the cops.

15:44.380 --> 15:49.237
It's either the protease inhibitor or
the AZT that's making me nauseous.

15:49.373 --> 15:52.822
No, I understand.
I haven't missed any doses.

15:54.431 --> 15:57.880
Thanks, Dr. D'Angelo,
I'd appreciate it. Bye.

15:59.873 --> 16:03.966
- What's up?
- Take the ankle fracture. I'm buried.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.124
You won't have any trouble finding
a nurse to assist.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.950
You okay?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.591
- Short stick gets it.
- Who can help with an ankle splint?

16:14.757 --> 16:16.514
- We'll tell you in a second.
- Damn!

16:16.678 --> 16:19.264
- I thought you were engaged.
- But I ain't dead.

16:19.431 --> 16:21.887
A behind like that could bring me back
from the dead.

16:22.023 --> 16:26.727
- Oh, yes! I'll send you a post card.
- What's so great about Exam 2?

16:26.922 --> 16:30.152
Put Dennis Quaid, Robert Redford
and James Dean in a blender...

16:30.314 --> 16:32.070
...you got Exam 2.

16:41.037 --> 16:45.130
Mr. MclKenna? Hi, I'm Jeanie Boulet.
I hear you have an ankle fracture.

16:45.295 --> 16:49.486
I was welding a girder up on the
ninth floor of a new office building.

16:49.648 --> 16:52.649
Wendy. Wendy, splint.

16:52.785 --> 16:55.437
I lost my footing,
my ankle went snap.

16:55.602 --> 16:59.694
If it hadn't been for Mickey's fast
catch, I would've been a goner.

16:59.891 --> 17:02.280
- Are you up for one more good deed?
- Sure.

17:02.484 --> 17:06.992
Hold his foot steady at a 90-degree
angle, and we're gonna splint it.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.678
- How's that?
- Perfect.

17:11.958 --> 17:15.058
- Didn't I see the food poisoning?
- That was the giardia diarrhea.

17:15.223 --> 17:19.829
You take the food poisoning.
Compazine, clear liquids, et cetera.

17:20.794 --> 17:23.281
Let me know as soon as he's back.

17:25.402 --> 17:27.891
- Mark, can we talk?
- Sure.

17:28.924 --> 17:33.977
I heard Nadine Wilkes' tox screen
was positive for coke.

17:34.173 --> 17:36.313
And Doug Ross is working today?

17:37.471 --> 17:39.260
It's been taken care of.

17:41.472 --> 17:45.980
I know Doug is your friend, but I'm
Attending on this shift as well.

17:46.145 --> 17:51.165
- His tox screen came back negative.
- How about his blood alcohol?

17:51.330 --> 17:52.607
He's fine.

17:53.635 --> 17:57.411
Good. He's putting a chest tube
in a 12-year-old right now.

17:59.045 --> 18:02.308
- He may need some help.
- Good idea.

18:05.094 --> 18:07.429
Tension pneumo. Decompress,
14-gauge.

18:07.623 --> 18:09.893
- He's cyanotic.
- Any I.D.?

18:10.056 --> 18:13.799
No, but his prints are on file.
The cops were right behind me.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.547
- Vitals are improving.
- Twenty-eight French.

18:17.866 --> 18:22.210
- Thought you might need an assist.
- Nope. We've got it under control.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.901
I'll just stay and watch.

18:31.566 --> 18:34.120
O-silk. I'm in. Hook it up.

18:37.840 --> 18:42.031
Hey, Carol, what's the hourly rate
for babysitting these days?

18:45.074 --> 18:48.075
I am amazed, Peter.
I thought you'd need backup.

18:48.243 --> 18:52.554
- It wasn't easy.
- I've gone a few rounds with Laura.

18:52.725 --> 18:57.363
But you didn't have to call in
the cavalry. I am impressed.

18:57.526 --> 19:01.456
You know, actually Carter was
very helpful in breaking the ice.

19:08.153 --> 19:10.259
She's got a couple more
questions for you.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.842
How would you like
to scrub in with us?

19:14.043 --> 19:17.175
Unless Dr. Benton needs you
elsewhere?

19:19.101 --> 19:23.924
When I was a kid, we boosted bags of
chips. Now they want the whole store.

19:25.086 --> 19:28.218
- Grab a cup of coffee?
- I should probably stay close.

19:28.383 --> 19:30.970
Pardon me? Are you Dr. Ross?

19:31.104 --> 19:35.066
That kid, he's out. He's not gonna be
up for a couple of hours, so...

19:35.234 --> 19:39.643
Actually, doctor, we wanted to speak
to you about Nadine Wilkes.

19:39.842 --> 19:41.250
Okay, fine.

19:42.883 --> 19:45.251
There's a room back here. Excuse us.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.455
When did her medical condition
first come on?

19:51.622 --> 19:54.274
She started seizing around 6 a.m.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.499
- And she died at 7:34?
- That sounds right.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.567
I didn't mean to interrupt.
You wanted to see me?

20:01.737 --> 20:05.383
- We'll be out in a minute, Mark.
- Are you the Attending Physician?

20:05.515 --> 20:07.272
- Pronounced Nadine Wilkes?
- I did.

20:07.436 --> 20:11.627
Why don't you stick around? We've
got a couple of questions for you too.

20:11.821 --> 20:16.557
- So no idea about next of kin?
- No. I told you we'd just met.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.533
- Last call, Roarke's Bar. I got that.
- That's right.

20:19.695 --> 20:23.493
- What?
- Roarke's Bar. Kind of a kinky crowd.

20:23.664 --> 20:28.105
At this joint, or later at your place,
you never saw her take any drugs?

20:28.273 --> 20:32.016
No. I mean, she went to the bathroom
a couple of times.

20:32.179 --> 20:33.739
- In between?
- Mm-hm.

20:34.963 --> 20:37.998
- She didn't ask for a prescription?
- No.

20:38.132 --> 20:41.428
You didn't give her a little something
to keep her going?

20:41.590 --> 20:44.078
- You're not that kind of guy?
- No.

20:46.999 --> 20:48.658
Okay.

20:48.824 --> 20:51.061
Can we speak to you outside, please?

21:00.923 --> 21:05.714
In a 16-year-old, the organs are
identical to those of an adult.

21:05.885 --> 21:09.431
In a neonate, on the other hand,
the liver is as big as Kansas.

21:09.565 --> 21:11.322
Needle holder.

21:11.486 --> 21:14.836
Boy, you could do this
with your eyes closed.

21:16.352 --> 21:22.551
John, how did you get Laura in here
without hired muscle or sedatives?

21:22.786 --> 21:24.543
- Gym pass.
- Gym pass?

21:25.571 --> 21:29.827
Yeah. Locker rooms can be tough
enough without an ostomy bag.

21:29.988 --> 21:35.423
- Kids are vicious. And I am a doctor.
- So you wrote her a pass out of gym?

21:35.589 --> 21:39.616
And told her she probably wouldn't
have the bag by championship game.

21:39.751 --> 21:42.599
- And that's in...?
- Late November.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.510
She's in the band.
I hope I didn't...

21:45.673 --> 21:47.877
No, with any luck she should make it.

21:53.163 --> 21:55.717
Ortho could be backed up
for a couple more hours.

21:55.884 --> 22:00.042
Mr. MclKenna said he'll take a cab. He
doesn't want you to miss your class.

22:00.205 --> 22:03.981
- Thanks, Miss Boulet, but I can wait.
- Anyone hungry?

22:04.142 --> 22:08.453
More pudding.
They said that County's unfriendly.

22:08.624 --> 22:10.413
You're being taken care of.

22:10.576 --> 22:13.773
So what kind of class are you taking?

22:15.025 --> 22:17.677
I sort of moonlight
as a dance instructor.

22:17.842 --> 22:21.705
- What type of dancing?
- All types, but country mostly.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.559
- Like line dancing.
- There's more to country than that.

22:24.724 --> 22:28.020
- Show us a few moves, cowboy.
- Here?

22:28.213 --> 22:30.931
- Why not?
- No music.

22:31.094 --> 22:32.818
We can fix that.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.128
The good news is, you're not pregnant.

22:39.289 --> 22:42.104
- Can you understand me?
- Yes. It's good.

22:42.265 --> 22:45.114
Now we have to do a pelvic exam
to find out why you're in pain.

22:45.242 --> 22:47.381
- You do the exam?
- No.

22:47.547 --> 22:50.265
A doctor will do the exam,
but he's very good.

22:50.428 --> 22:52.818
No, I don't need.
I'm fine, not pregnant.

22:53.020 --> 22:58.325
Miss Jung Koo Baek,
what seems to be the problem?

22:58.526 --> 23:01.975
- No problem. I could go home now.
- Doug, can I talk to you outside?

23:02.144 --> 23:04.763
- Just sit tight. I'll be right back.
- We'll be right back.

23:08.257 --> 23:11.160
She's 15 years old. One sexual
experience two months ago.

23:11.330 --> 23:13.436
Abdominal pain, fever's 101.

23:13.603 --> 23:16.059
She complains of vaginal discharge.
She's not pregnant.

23:16.196 --> 23:20.092
- Sounds like PID. I'll do a pelvic.
- She's a little jumpy.

23:20.261 --> 23:22.978
- She's never had a pelvic.
- I think I can handle that.

23:23.174 --> 23:27.453
I'm afraid she's gonna bolt. But she'd
probably let me take the cultures.

23:28.455 --> 23:31.555
- You're second-guessing me too?
- I don't give a damn about you.

23:31.721 --> 23:35.071
- I'm trying to take care of a patient.
- What's up?

23:35.241 --> 23:38.755
Carol thinks she's better suited
to perform a pelvic without me.

23:38.922 --> 23:42.600
- Carol, you know that you...
- I just want to take the swabs.

23:42.763 --> 23:46.409
- She's really afraid of men.
- Doyle, are you free?

23:46.573 --> 23:50.665
- That's my patient.
- Come help Carol do a pelvic.

23:50.798 --> 23:52.806
Okay?

23:56.591 --> 23:58.926
You're overreacting, Doug.

23:59.088 --> 24:02.123
What is it with you? Kerry Weaver's
breathing down my neck.

24:02.290 --> 24:05.258
People part like the Red Sea
when I walk down the hallway.

24:05.427 --> 24:10.546
- The tox screen came back negative.
- You didn't get a blood alcohol.

24:10.708 --> 24:14.124
How many times have you and I had
margaritas into the wee hours?

24:14.293 --> 24:17.392
Did you check your blood alcohol
every morning?

24:19.063 --> 24:21.005
Unbelievable.

24:21.943 --> 24:24.181
Let me tell you something
as a friend.

24:24.344 --> 24:27.923
You can't be my friend and my boss.
You chose to be my boss.

24:28.121 --> 24:31.734
I don't need your sanctimonious
approval of my life.

24:31.963 --> 24:34.811
Don't come to me for tips
on women anymore.

24:35.003 --> 24:40.274
If I have a Roman orgy with farm
animals, that's none of your business.

24:40.445 --> 24:44.505
That's none of anybody's business.
I am a doctor here! I do my job!

24:44.670 --> 24:47.060
Nothing gets in the way of that!
Nothing!

24:47.231 --> 24:52.830
Today you brought in a dying woman
and messed up everybody else's work.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.961
That's a problem. If you don't see
that, you don't belong here.

24:56.129 --> 24:57.656
- I'll tell you what...
- Hello, everybody.

24:57.826 --> 25:02.399
I thought I'd see how your pilot study
is going. Medical/surgical division?

25:02.596 --> 25:06.143
We still have a few kinks to work out.
Let me show you the board.

25:06.308 --> 25:12.290
A single-vehicle, high-speed TC's
coming in. Looks extremely surgical.

25:12.454 --> 25:16.317
- Do you want me to let Weaver know?
- Screw the new system. I'll take it.

25:16.488 --> 25:18.692
Call Surgical.
Get a consult down here.

25:18.857 --> 25:21.956
- Mark, we're not finished yet.
- Yes, we are.

25:30.699 --> 25:33.318
Oh, man! I haven't done
one of these in six months.

25:33.517 --> 25:35.557
Don't worry. I've assisted a million.

25:36.717 --> 25:38.311
Thanks.

25:38.479 --> 25:41.546
Okay, just relax. Good.

25:41.712 --> 25:45.008
Now let your knees fall open. Good.

25:50.322 --> 25:53.356
Okay, this is gonna feel
a little weird.

25:57.172 --> 25:59.060
Okay, Jung Koo, take a deep breath.

26:00.405 --> 26:03.789
Good. Dr. Doyle is gonna
take a deep breath too.

26:06.742 --> 26:08.685
Angle lower.

26:09.816 --> 26:13.974
Right. Relax these muscles.
Don't push away.

26:14.137 --> 26:18.099
Dr. Doyle is not gonna push either.
Nobody is gonna push.

26:18.266 --> 26:21.528
It's just gonna slide right in.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.275
There.

26:24.444 --> 26:25.753
Rotate and click.

26:31.838 --> 26:33.628
KOH and wet mount.

26:34.527 --> 26:36.350
And chlamydia.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.150
There you go.

26:42.721 --> 26:46.105
Mrs. Armitage. Hi, I'm Dr. Benton.
We met earlier.

26:46.274 --> 26:47.682
Oh, yes.

26:47.843 --> 26:53.474
- I'm sorry Laura was so rude to you.
- That was nothing.

26:53.637 --> 26:55.678
I don't know what to do
with her anymore.

26:55.846 --> 26:59.392
She's gonna be on IV antibiotics
for five days.

26:59.526 --> 27:02.527
And then she's gonna be
discharged in seven.

27:02.695 --> 27:06.558
- Mrs. Armitage knows the drill.
- Hi, Abby.

27:07.849 --> 27:14.080
Mrs. Armitage's concerns are more
related to Laura's overall well-being.

27:15.371 --> 27:18.154
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

27:18.316 --> 27:22.507
Sometimes they have problems
making the adjustment.

27:22.669 --> 27:26.347
We have a psychiatrist on staff.
Maybe they can help.

27:30.512 --> 27:34.125
Diane, you've got to stop babying her.

27:34.257 --> 27:38.153
She knows how to be a patient.
She's done that for years.

27:38.322 --> 27:40.778
Now she's a teenager.
She's gonna rebel.

27:40.979 --> 27:44.558
And you've got to be the bad guy.
Set the limits.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.784
You're right. I know.

27:48.949 --> 27:52.496
God willing, this surgery will be
her last.

28:06.011 --> 28:07.986
Dr. Greene?

28:09.244 --> 28:12.758
- You called for a Surgical.
- Yeah. Sounds like a spatula job.

28:12.956 --> 28:14.517
- How's your day?
- Fine.

28:14.717 --> 28:19.388
Great card from Dr. Lewis. Only she
would send a post card from O'Hare.

28:19.551 --> 28:21.821
- You got a card?
- Yeah. You didn't?

28:21.984 --> 28:24.221
No, I didn't.

28:30.146 --> 28:32.056
- Thanks for all your help.
- Part of the job.

28:32.226 --> 28:35.904
- I want to order a pelvic ultrasound.
- You did. Just need to sign it.

28:36.035 --> 28:38.851
Jerry, what's going on over there
at chairs?

28:39.013 --> 28:41.981
Some guy's trying to seduce
the nursing staff.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.874
Ma? You're early.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.438
Ten minutes.
It'll take five to walk over.

28:46.631 --> 28:48.387
I'll get my purse.

28:49.735 --> 28:53.413
- They don't have a locker for that?
- No, Ma.

28:53.576 --> 28:59.524
- And this is how you work?
- Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Ross.

28:59.690 --> 29:02.560
He's out in the ambulance pad.

29:02.731 --> 29:04.488
Come on, we'll show you.

29:11.118 --> 29:12.711
Hey, Doug.

29:16.048 --> 29:20.555
- Hi, Helen. How have you been?
- I have been well.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.892
- And yourself?
- I can't complain.

29:23.057 --> 29:27.532
- This lady is looking for you.
- Okay. Have a nice dinner.

29:28.403 --> 29:29.996
Hi.

29:33.204 --> 29:37.548
- Do I know you?
- I'm Claire Wilkes.

29:37.718 --> 29:39.890
You worked on my sister, Nadine.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.988
I'm sorry.

29:45.048 --> 29:49.522
I wish there was more
that we could've done.

29:49.722 --> 29:54.033
Nadine died just like she lived:
Drunk, high and alone.

29:54.235 --> 29:57.978
Actually, a friend brought her in.

29:58.140 --> 30:01.272
I know what kind of friend she had
at 4 a.m.

30:03.485 --> 30:06.486
Did she have a medical condition
that we didn't know about?

30:06.655 --> 30:10.911
Wasn't she wearing her bracelet?
Nadine was an epileptic.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.718
She knew she wasn't supposed
to drink, but that didn't stop her.

30:17.698 --> 30:20.349
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.287
The coroner's office still has
to do an autopsy.

30:28.453 --> 30:31.137
That's why the tubes are
still in there.

30:36.487 --> 30:38.909
She had so much to give.

30:40.809 --> 30:42.784
A fire in her.

30:45.706 --> 30:48.839
And then when the seizures started...

30:49.004 --> 30:53.096
...it just made her lose
her confidence somehow.

30:55.405 --> 30:59.563
She could always find the guys to
help her sink just a little lower.

31:01.487 --> 31:04.074
Chip away at her self-esteem.

31:09.553 --> 31:12.172
Whatever you were looking for,
Nadine...

31:13.842 --> 31:16.080
...I hope you found it.

31:18.388 --> 31:20.144
Oh, God!

31:40.058 --> 31:44.467
Come on. How about some two-step?
That is a quick-quick, slow-slow.

31:47.677 --> 31:52.599
I like that. Oh, okay.
Quick-quick, slow-slow.

32:01.217 --> 32:04.185
- Here you go.
- Work it, Lydia.

32:05.474 --> 32:09.469
I just got a call from Ortho.
Your friend's next up, I promise.

32:09.635 --> 32:13.051
How about some two-step?
It's really easy.

32:13.220 --> 32:15.709
- Quick-quick, slow-slow.
- All right, Jeanie!

32:16.998 --> 32:19.333
All right, girl! Come on.

32:58.193 --> 33:01.511
- X-rays for Trauma 2.
- Good.

33:01.715 --> 33:03.090
Hey.

33:04.532 --> 33:07.849
- You're quite a dancer.
- You're not half-bad yourself.

33:09.269 --> 33:13.067
- How's that pie, Ma?
- At least here they don't overcharge.

33:13.239 --> 33:17.975
A good thing when you're on a budget.
A lesson I hope you'll finally learn.

33:18.136 --> 33:23.091
- So I got in a little over my head.
- Because you bought a big house.

33:23.225 --> 33:27.536
An apartment is big enough for
one woman. A house is for a family.

33:27.707 --> 33:31.418
And you don't want to marry.
Dr. Ross wasn't right, I agree.

33:31.580 --> 33:36.567
Dr. Taglieri wasn't either. But then
you can't live like a doctor's wife.

33:36.765 --> 33:40.279
- Ma, I don't need this today.
- A nurse is not a queen.

33:40.446 --> 33:42.683
- I've noticed.
- A nurse has to watch her money.

33:42.847 --> 33:45.750
While teaching interns to make
quadruple her salary.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.401
- You can't change that.
- Maybe not.

33:49.569 --> 33:53.116
Anyway, anyone can get
into a little trouble.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.600
- What's this?
- To pay your plumber and roofer.

33:56.739 --> 34:00.931
And you can finish the plaster.
I don't want you to live in a dump.

34:01.093 --> 34:03.395
Ma, that is so sweet.

34:04.646 --> 34:07.014
- But I can't take this from you.
- From who, then?

34:07.206 --> 34:09.574
I can't even take that as a loan.

34:09.766 --> 34:12.833
You'd rather owe strangers
than your own mother?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.495
Yeah.

34:15.529 --> 34:21.379
What if it's not a loan?
What if it's more like a kind of rent?

34:23.114 --> 34:25.351
What kind of rent, Ma?

34:27.085 --> 34:29.452
"Pediatric Surgeon of the Year"?

34:29.614 --> 34:32.232
"The Price Award." Oh, man!

34:34.063 --> 34:36.136
That's very prestigious.

34:36.335 --> 34:40.079
I was really pleased with
how the Armitage surgery went.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.996
Thanks for the opportunity.

34:42.161 --> 34:46.734
You're a gifted surgeon,
and you do really well in the O.R.

34:46.899 --> 34:50.031
It's outside the operating room
where you need work.

34:55.541 --> 35:01.107
Peter, pediatric surgery focuses on
the child, not just the illness.

35:02.070 --> 35:04.460
That mother needed something
from you today.

35:04.632 --> 35:08.048
You thought your job was over
when you took your gloves off.

35:08.249 --> 35:13.007
You've got great hands.
Now you gotta show some heart.

35:15.579 --> 35:19.192
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Learn.

35:24.382 --> 35:28.180
I'm looking at it right now.
"One-hour photo, guaranteed."

35:28.351 --> 35:31.800
It doesn't apply to slides?
Slides are see-through photos.

35:31.936 --> 35:34.654
- Can I see your catalog of classes?
- Help yourself.

35:34.817 --> 35:37.851
- Benton's gonna kill me.
- Again?

35:38.017 --> 35:41.084
So, Carter, was it that bad living
with your parents again?

35:41.283 --> 35:43.040
Pretty strange. Why?

35:43.204 --> 35:47.099
My mom moved to the burbs, and now
she misses her friends at church.

35:47.268 --> 35:51.361
- She wants to stay Saturday nights.
- Just one night a week?

35:51.526 --> 35:54.079
You can always sign up
for work Saturday.

35:55.911 --> 36:00.135
- That's a good idea.
- We start Qigong next week.

36:01.737 --> 36:05.961
- No. You mind if I tear out a page?
- Go ahead.

36:08.651 --> 36:11.302
- Pre-med?
- It's for a friend.

36:19.118 --> 36:23.243
- He's still not up there?
- He's in the car, crutches and all.

36:23.407 --> 36:26.572
- Tell him to take it easy.
- I just wanted to say thanks.

36:26.736 --> 36:32.684
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to go out dancing sometime?

36:32.850 --> 36:35.469
Grab a bite. I don't know.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.810
- I'm sorry, I can't date patients.
- I wasn't the patient, so...

36:40.980 --> 36:43.883
- No, really, I can't.
- I'm a good guy. We'll go dancing.

36:44.085 --> 36:49.390
I'll buy you a steak. If you don't
like me, at least you got the steak.

36:51.543 --> 36:56.247
- I can't.
- All right. Sorry. I got ya.

36:56.409 --> 36:57.718
See you around.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.843
- Table for one?
- Yeah.

37:27.011 --> 37:31.070
- Is Carla working tonight?
- Yeah, she's here every night.

37:31.235 --> 37:33.986
Can you tell her
that Peter Benton is here?

37:34.149 --> 37:39.071
Oh, you're Peter Benton?
I can seat you at the counter.

37:42.919 --> 37:44.960
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

37:57.996 --> 38:00.997
- Hey.
- Well, well, well.

38:04.654 --> 38:06.662
- The place looks great.
- Thank you.

38:06.830 --> 38:10.890
You haven't seen my baby since
it was a little-bitty greasy spoon.

38:11.024 --> 38:17.005
Grand tour. And come with me, sir.
I'll show you the kitchen.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.618
You know Tyrone Harvey?
He cooks here.

38:20.818 --> 38:23.405
This is it.

38:23.603 --> 38:27.728
We just got two sub-zero freezers,
which is very, very nice.

38:27.892 --> 38:33.491
Do you remember that little Italian
place, Simeones, on Seneca?

38:33.654 --> 38:39.023
They closed and I picked up a bunch
of stuff for almost nothing. Great.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.429
You've made quite a place
for yourself.

38:41.593 --> 38:44.146
A lot of hard work.

38:49.627 --> 38:53.523
Well, you must have a taste
in your mouth for something...

38:53.724 --> 38:55.580
...to come all the way up here.

39:15.234 --> 39:17.242
This isn't your line.

39:17.411 --> 39:19.997
That's a buck down the drain.

39:22.533 --> 39:28.230
That girl who came in this afternoon
was Nadine Wilkes' sister.

39:28.423 --> 39:32.166
She came in to I.D. Her.

39:33.864 --> 39:37.182
She just thought I was
another caring doctor.

39:37.354 --> 39:40.770
I let her go right on thinking that
'cause...

39:40.939 --> 39:45.348
...that's what I want everybody
to think.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.541
Hey, Carol.

39:55.695 --> 39:58.063
I think I really did it this time.

40:01.169 --> 40:03.504
You came up here for what?

40:04.529 --> 40:06.635
Cry on my shoulder?

40:06.802 --> 40:10.032
Tell me how worthless you really are
deep down inside?

40:10.195 --> 40:15.282
And I'd say, "No, you're not, Doug.
You're one hell of a guy."

40:15.445 --> 40:18.707
And you'd be able to live
with yourself until the next time?

40:19.414 --> 40:22.033
No. No, thanks.

40:23.799 --> 40:26.418
I'm just not playing.
You're on your own.

40:36.123 --> 40:37.978
I didn't know she was sick.

40:39.196 --> 40:41.335
You didn't know her at all.

41:31.436 --> 41:35.365
<i>Hey, Doug. It's Lauren.</i>
<i>Give me a call</i>.

41:35.565 --> 41:38.697

41:41.295 --> 41:45.322

41:48.784 --> 41:51.207

41:52.402 --> 41:55.698
<i>Thursday, 5: 17 p.m.</i>

41:58.643 --> 42:00.237
<i>Dr. Anspaugh's office calling.</i>

42:00.404 --> 42:05.140

42:06.582 --> 42:09.681
