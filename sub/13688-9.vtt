{\an1}- That's not
what I'm doing, bro.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.506
- That's exactly
what you're doing.

37:55.573 --> 37:58.009
You're manipulating her
'cause you're making her

37:58.075 --> 38:00.044
{\an3}feel bad for having fun
with Mechie.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.445
<i>What he's doing to her</i>
<i>is not right,</i>

38:01.512 --> 38:03.748
{\an8}but nobody's ever called him
out in the moment,

38:03.814 --> 38:05.650
{\an8}so I just wanted
to point out, Ariana,

38:05.716 --> 38:07.952
{\an8}<i>this is exactly what Cam</i>
<i>does to you on a daily basis,</i>

38:08.019 --> 38:10.354
{\an8}which is why everybody's
saying he's a manipulator.

38:10.421 --> 38:12.289
{\an7}- So if it would've been Mark,
you wouldn't have cared?

38:12.356 --> 38:13.858
{\an8}- I would feel bad
if I picked her best friend

38:13.924 --> 38:15.292
{\an8}and walked in the house.
I wouldn't even--

38:15.359 --> 38:16.894
{\an8}I wouldn't even do [bleep]
in front of her.

38:16.961 --> 38:17.928

38:17.995 --> 38:19.096
{\an8}- I haven't done anything.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.898
{\an8}- Talk to her,
and I won't say [bleep].

38:20.965 --> 38:23.167
{\an8}This is very similar
to buyer's remorse.

38:23.234 --> 38:25.503
{\an8}<i>Now, no matter what feelings</i>

38:25.569 --> 38:26.637

chose Alexis."

38:28.105 --> 38:30.274
{\an8}<i>And seeing her with Mechie</i>
<i>is not only</i>

38:30.341 --> 38:32.877
{\an8}keeping those feelings there
but amplifying them times ten,

38:32.943 --> 38:34.311
{\an8}because now I'm jealous
on top of it,

38:34.378 --> 38:36.347

I have no one

38:36.414 --> 38:38.549
{\an8}to even [bleep] talk to
that will even listen to me,

38:38.616 --> 38:40.818
{\an8}because I've already picked
a girl in front of her.

38:40.885 --> 38:43.120
{\an9}- I don't give a [bleep].
Don't feel bad.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.922
