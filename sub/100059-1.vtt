WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.483
- Last season on "Superstore."

00:05.527 --> 00:06.919
- Hey, so, random--

00:06.963 --> 00:08.399
I was going through some old
security footage.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.140
Well, I came across the time
you let all my birds escape.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.316
I will never forgive you.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.231
- Do you want to get married?
- Okay.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.364
- We've authorized ICE to do
a worksite enforcement.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.540
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.671
- Okay, you guys need
to keep going straight

00:19.715 --> 00:21.282
through Bath and Beauty,

00:21.325 --> 00:22.718
then we're gonna try to make it
all the way to the end

00:22.761 --> 00:24.502
of the garden section.
- Hey!

00:24.546 --> 00:26.548
- Guys, it's over.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.253
- Wow, this is so awesome.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.212
So many people came out
to support Mateo.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.344
- Yeah, yeah, and on such
short notice, too.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.086
Only three hours
to put it together.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.609
I think we even
beat his family here.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.656
- Are you seriously bragging
about how well you organized

00:47.699 --> 00:49.310
a vigil for your friend

00:49.353 --> 00:51.660
who was just
detained by ICE today?

00:51.703 --> 00:52.704
- No.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.142
- All right, I got burgers.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.493
Does anyone have buns,
matches, or charcoal?

00:58.536 --> 01:00.582
- Yeah, no, because this isn't
a tailgate party.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.105
It's a candlelight vigil.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.368
- Oh, then what are we
supposed to be doing?

01:04.412 --> 01:10.287
- Um, you know,
we're--we're doing the--

01:10.331 --> 01:13.073
We're--the vigil.
The--Jonah, you wanna--

01:13.116 --> 01:14.422
I don't want
to step on your toes.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.815
- Oh, I was primarily focused
on the group E-mail.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.121
- Why don't we ask
those people?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.383
They said that they've
been vigil-ing

01:19.427 --> 01:22.125
for their uncle
for five months.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.127
- Five months?
- Yeah.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.304
- Um, I know this might be
a weird time,

01:27.348 --> 01:30.525
but since we're all together,
I have some exciting news.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.744
- You know,
when my church does a vigil,

01:32.788 --> 01:34.703
we always sing songs.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.574
- Yes!
Let's do that.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.534
- Okay, well, we start with
"O Living Bread from Heaven,"

01:39.577 --> 01:42.798
and then go straight into
"Alas did my Savior Bleed."

01:42.841 --> 01:44.713
- Ah, so mostly just
Top 40 stuff?

01:44.756 --> 01:46.149
- I think we can find a song

01:46.193 --> 01:47.846
that's a little bit
more Mateo-y.

01:47.890 --> 01:50.762
- Yeah, I think he likes,
uh, Taylor Swift.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.764
- No, he's back
to hating her again.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.723
- Do people know
"Yalla Tnam Rima?"

01:54.766 --> 01:57.552
- No, but I wish I did.
It sounds gorgeous.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.771
- Guys, let's pick a song
that we all know

01:59.815 --> 02:01.469
in a language we all know.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.471
- Got it.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.821
♪ Pizza in the morning
all: ♪ Pizza in the evening

02:05.864 --> 02:08.432
all: ♪ Pizza at supper time
- Guys, are you guys--

02:08.476 --> 02:10.652
all: ♪ When pizza's
on a bagel ♪

02:10.695 --> 02:16.266
- ♪ You can eat
pizza anytime ♪

02:19.878 --> 02:21.271
Never had any training.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.931
- I know we got
other things on our mind

02:28.974 --> 02:30.454
with, uh, Mateo and everything,

02:30.498 --> 02:33.240
but why does MC Cool Cloud
have a jetpack?

02:33.283 --> 02:35.590
He's a cloud.
They're already in the sky.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.635
- Also, Cloud 9.0?

02:37.679 --> 02:39.942
Does corporate think ".0"
just means high tech?

02:39.985 --> 02:41.813
- No, it means cool,
like "Tosh.0."

02:41.857 --> 02:44.642
- Great, guys, we could tear
this apart all day.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.341
The point is Cloud 9
just wants to communicate

02:47.384 --> 02:49.691
that it's modern
and forward-thinking.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.650
Anyway, we'll be rolling out
Cloud 9.0 technology

02:52.694 --> 02:55.218
like a digital map
of the store--a Smartphone app.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.480
Guess they finally
heard about those.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.961
- Oh, are we gonna get paid
in Bitcoin?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.658
- Um, no.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.618
- Aww, man, I really want
to find out what Bitcoin is.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.489
- So this is what they think
will save them

03:05.533 --> 03:08.927
from online retailers?
A confusing ad and a free app?

03:08.971 --> 03:11.234
- Oh, it's not free.
It's 2.99.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.931
- Well, I think all this
is great.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.498
I mean, come on.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.500
Let people know that the
brick-and-mortar stores

03:16.544 --> 03:19.634
are keeping up with the times.
The future is now!

03:19.677 --> 03:22.245
And also in the future.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.855
- Good attitude, Glenn.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.510
Also as part of Cloud 9.0,

03:26.554 --> 03:29.513
they've sent us a new
high-tech floor cleaner.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.515
- Check it out, people.
We got a robot.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.344
It was nice of corporate
to wait an entire week

03:34.388 --> 03:35.389
before they reminded us

03:35.432 --> 03:37.521
we're just
as replaceable as Mateo.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.871
- Hey, nobody can
replace Mateo.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.786
- Aren't you living
in his apartment?

03:41.830 --> 03:43.832
- Yes, I'm keeping an eye
on his stuff.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.356
- Look, this robot is not here
to replace anybody.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.706
- Why does this high-tech robot
have tape on it?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.882
- Oh, this is the best part.
- Um, that's just the design--

03:50.926 --> 03:52.275
- No, we decided we were gonna
keep the tape on--

03:52.319 --> 03:53.885
- Hey, he asked, okay?

03:53.929 --> 03:56.845
- So, um, I just wanna say that
I think corporate wanted

03:56.888 --> 03:59.021
to make the robot seem not so
intimidating to customers,

03:59.064 --> 04:00.544
so they gave it a name tag.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.893
It's a perfectly random name.
- Okay.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.895
- It's just a random name.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.289
- Look at that, Glenn.
Same name.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.638
- It's not the same at all.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.771
I mean, look,
it's spelled with one N.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.251
Like a serial killer.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.948
- So corporate's not
replacing us,

04:12.991 --> 04:16.691
but they sent us a robot to do
our jobs and its name is Glen?

04:18.345 --> 04:19.563
- Meeting adjourned!

04:19.607 --> 04:21.304
- Actually, I have
an announcement.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.437
I haven't been able to find
the right moment, but--

04:23.480 --> 04:25.308
- Damn it, Sandra.
Meeting adjourned!

04:25.352 --> 04:27.702
Okay?
We can't re-journ!

04:33.621 --> 04:35.579
- So they're still
debugging the app,

04:35.623 --> 04:37.755
but just tell Android users
it'll be available soon.

04:37.799 --> 04:41.455
Switching gears,
any union chatter over there?

04:41.498 --> 04:43.021
'Cause we can always
send someone in.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.936
- Nope, no need.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.503
You know, it's funny.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.592
All the talk about unionizing
just sort of went away

04:48.636 --> 04:50.507
after the ICE raid last week.

04:50.551 --> 04:53.641
Weird, almost like that had
something to do with it.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.947
- Oh, gosh,
wasn't that so tragic?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.340
Just a shame.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.037
Okay, bye.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.648
- Dick.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.780
Pretending like corporate
didn't send ICE in here.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.609
- Yeah, but well played
with the anti-union stuff.

05:05.653 --> 05:09.483
You're like a double agent.
My own Elizabeth Jennings.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.572
- Is that from "The Americans?"

05:11.615 --> 05:12.660
- Yeah, it's so good.
You should just--

05:12.703 --> 05:14.618
- I'm not gonna watch it.
- Just--

05:14.662 --> 05:15.924
- But I do think we need
to cool it a little

05:15.967 --> 05:17.447
with the union stuff.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.362
Corporate's is checking in
every day.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.756
They are super paranoid.
We need them to calm down.

05:21.799 --> 05:24.062
We can impress them with
the Cloud 9.0 rollout

05:24.106 --> 05:26.935
and then when they least
expect it,

05:26.978 --> 05:27.979
hit them with the union.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.807
- Yeah, okay, makes sense.

05:29.851 --> 05:33.550
- Which is why I need you
to watch the robot today.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.986
Just program its route.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.553
- Wait, what?

05:36.597 --> 05:37.989
You want me to--you want me
to train the thing

05:38.033 --> 05:39.643
that's here to replace us?

05:39.687 --> 05:42.385
- Jonah, come on.
You're the only one I trust.

05:42.429 --> 05:46.346
- Fine, I'll babysit
the robot for one day.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.392
It's nice to hear
that you trust me so much.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.393
- Don't make such
a big deal out of it.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.481
- Okay, it just feels good.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.700
- Man, come on, Dina.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.223
Did you throw away
my lunch again?

05:54.266 --> 05:56.051
- Did you really think writing
Elias on it would work?

05:56.094 --> 05:57.661
I know your handwriting.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.141
- Okay, well when are you gonna
stop punishing me?

05:59.184 --> 06:01.535
- Mm, maybe when my birds
stop being dead.

06:01.578 --> 06:02.666
How's then sound?

06:02.710 --> 06:04.146
Now, pipe down.
We're busy.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.582
- Oh, yeah,
I can see that.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.497
You guys are two busy little
builders over here.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.890
- This is the detention center.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.979
We're hatching a plan
to bust out Mateo.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.807
Now, the key is to go at night

06:12.850 --> 06:14.678
when the guards are fast
asleep.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.854
- Wow, that's a great plan.
You know what you could do?

06:16.898 --> 06:20.467
You could hang a poster of
the moon up outside the window

06:20.510 --> 06:21.946
That way they'll think
it's night time.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.339
You can go in
whenever you want.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.124
- I'm writing this down.
- He's mocking us, Marcus.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.866
He only likes letting birds
out of cages, not people.

06:28.910 --> 06:32.130
- Mm, okay, so you're seriously
gonna do this plan?

06:32.174 --> 06:33.654
- Well, I have
to try something.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.438
I mean, I'm the one that
let Mateo get detained.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.439
- What?
No, you didn't--

06:36.483 --> 06:38.006
- I was on the monitors.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.529
I should have been able
to find him an escape route.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.575
But don't worry.
No one expects you to help.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.926
Okay, some people are helpers.
Some are destroyers.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.884
Some people donate blood.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.713
Some steal blood and sell it
for video game money.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.933
- I don't--
nobody does that.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.543
- My cousin Rick does.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.849
- So, wait, are you saying
if I don't help you

06:54.892 --> 06:56.720
break Mateo out
of a heavily-guarded

06:56.764 --> 06:58.983
detention facility,
I'm a bad person?

06:59.027 --> 07:03.161
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.512
- Okay, I'll help.
Awesome.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.904
- Welcome aboard.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.211
Now, some of this is
from an old west set,

07:09.254 --> 07:12.170
so the doors at the detention
center might not swing open

07:12.214 --> 07:14.042
as easy as the saloon's.

07:14.085 --> 07:18.046
- Uh, no, we don't actually
sell jetpacks.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.179
Uh, hey, Chey,
can I talk to you for a second?

07:21.223 --> 07:23.181
- Sorry I was late
this morning.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.532
Harmonica was being
so difficult.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.534
I couldn't get her to finish
her breakfast soda.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.971
- Right.
Um, no, not that.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.756
Actually, uh, I went to
visit Mateo again yesterday,

07:32.800 --> 07:35.498
and he mentioned that
you hadn't been yet,

07:35.542 --> 07:37.761
and he told me he'd love
to see you.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.634
It's just been hard
to find a time.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.724
Bo's doing motocross now,
and he needs me to be

07:43.767 --> 07:45.943
at all the races
in case he dies.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.511
- Okay, uh, well, you know,

07:48.555 --> 07:49.947
if you ever want
to go during work,

07:49.991 --> 07:52.167
I could find someone to cover--
- Oh, thanks,

07:52.210 --> 07:53.603
but no,
don't worry.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.518
It's not like
I've forgotten about him.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.520
I'm keeping notes
on all the gossip

07:57.564 --> 08:00.001
and I've been taking photos
of all the bad outfits

08:00.044 --> 08:02.264
for him for when he gets back.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.614
- Okay, well, uh, I just--
I told him

08:04.658 --> 08:06.224
I'd relay the message so--

08:06.268 --> 08:07.617
Was that--did you just--

08:07.661 --> 08:09.227
- Okay, I should get
back to work.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.015
- ♪ Oh, oh,
listen to the music ♪

08:14.058 --> 08:15.625
♪ Oh, oh

08:15.669 --> 08:17.671
- So we're totally out
of jetpacks?

08:17.714 --> 08:20.108
- No, there were never
jetpacks.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.980
- Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to ask you

08:23.024 --> 08:24.547
to put that back.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.854
- Wait, does the Fenton store
have jetpacks?

08:26.897 --> 08:31.641
- Hey, Cheyenne, uh,
how's it going?

08:31.685 --> 08:34.296
Looks like this lovely lady
here would like to get

08:34.339 --> 08:36.777
some hair regrowth treatment.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.605
- It's for me.
I'm not embarrassed.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.520
- Yeah, no, you--
you shouldn't be.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.565
So why don't w--
- Wait, no leave it!

08:42.609 --> 08:44.567
Okay, you're ruining
the display!

08:44.611 --> 08:46.134
- Cheyenne--

08:46.177 --> 08:49.659
- God, no one cares
about anything around here!

08:49.703 --> 08:52.836
- Female pattern baldness
runs in my family.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.057
I'm not embarrassed.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.063
- I'm sorry for freaking out
at the bald lady.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.587
I had low blood sugar.
- Yeah.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.285
You know, actually, I went back
and checked the schedule,

09:07.329 --> 09:11.507
and it turns out that Mateo
set up that endcap

09:11.551 --> 09:14.510
on the day that he got
taken away by ICE.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.512
- Cool.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.166
- You know what?

09:18.209 --> 09:22.213
Actually, um, the other day,
I got so mad at Emma

09:22.257 --> 09:26.130
for wearing my pearl earrings,

09:26.174 --> 09:29.177
and I was like,
"Amy, what's going on?

09:29.220 --> 09:30.526
They're just earrings."

09:30.570 --> 09:32.615
But then I realized
that those earrings

09:32.659 --> 09:37.054
had been given to me by
somebody I loved dearly.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.143
My grandma, who died.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.493
Uh, she fell off
of an escalator,

09:41.537 --> 09:43.321
and--and cancer

09:43.365 --> 09:44.496
It doesn't really matter
how she died.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.541
That's not the point
of the story.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.716
- Got it.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.196
Emma's dressing
like an old lady,

09:48.239 --> 09:50.546
And you want me
to give her a makeover.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.678
I think it's time.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.375
- No, I'm saying
you miss Mateo

09:53.418 --> 09:55.420
and that it might not
just be good for him

09:55.464 --> 09:58.467
if you went and visited him.
It might be good for you, too.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.556
- Oh, wow, Amy.
That's really smart,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.341
and so wise.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.561
Thanks for being such
a good friend.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.650
- Aww.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.260
Thank you.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.567
- Thanks for always
looking out for me.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.612
- Thanks.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.442
Wait, are you gonna
go see Mateo?

10:17.486 --> 10:21.708
- ♪ Curtains for my muumuu
curtains for my ball of yarn ♪

10:21.751 --> 10:23.797
Hey!
Excuse me!

10:23.840 --> 10:25.407
Someone is up here!
- Sorry.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.669
- Jonah, make it stop!
- Sorry.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.192
I thought he had
the hang of it.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.280
- Make it stop!
- I know, I'm on it--

10:29.324 --> 10:32.283
- Where is it taking me?
Jonah!

10:32.327 --> 10:34.242
- Okay, none of us
are in the FBI,

10:34.285 --> 10:36.331
so claiming jurisdiction
is a no go.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.246
Garrett, where are we
with your connection

10:38.289 --> 10:40.074
inside the detention
center's infirmary?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.771
- Exactly where we were
when we started.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.599
I don't have one.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.167
- Ooh, do these bridal
magazines belong to anyone?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.603
'Cause I might want
to take a look.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.127
- Oh, my God, Sandra,
do you ever stop talking?

10:50.171 --> 10:52.477
- I--
- Answer me!

10:52.521 --> 10:54.741
- I don't know how to--

10:54.784 --> 10:56.307
Just go.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.485
Sorry about that, guys.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.229
- Oh, oh, okay.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.276
Guys, this is kind of just
a big Roomba, all right?

11:08.319 --> 11:12.193
- Hey, I was gonna clean
that spill.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.630
- Oh, well, yeah.
- I need a spill.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.588
- Oh, no, Glenn, you don't
need to prove yourself.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.721
- Refills are 49 cents.
- No, Gle--

11:18.765 --> 11:20.331
- Okay, here we go.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.856
If you think that robot
is good at cleaning,

11:22.899 --> 11:24.466
you should see Glenn the man.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.251
- Okay, Glenn the man,
there's no reason

11:27.295 --> 11:30.385
to be threatened by this thing.
- Really?

11:30.428 --> 11:33.388
'Cause first it took my name,
and then it pushed me out

11:33.431 --> 11:36.391
of the way while I was working,
and now it took my spill.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.436
I mean, maybe it should be
raising my child

11:38.480 --> 11:39.873
and sleeping with Jerusha.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.659
- Hey, get away from that!

11:43.703 --> 11:46.749
I said get away!

11:46.793 --> 11:48.664
- Oh, my God!
Cheyenne!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.361
Are you okay?

11:50.405 --> 11:52.494
- Do you feel like Cheyenne's
been acting weird lately?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.844
- Get him, Cheyenne!
He's after my wife!

11:54.888 --> 11:56.716
- Probably asking
the wrong person.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.243
- ♪ Just one look

12:02.286 --> 12:04.375
♪ And I knew

12:04.419 --> 12:07.683
- So, good news.
The robot is working fine,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.250
and there's no need
to involve corporate,

12:09.293 --> 12:11.165
so I'm not gonna write you up.

12:11.208 --> 12:14.342
- Okay, thanks, but you should
know that robot's a dumbass.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.778
Everyone's been saying it.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.824
- Uh, Amy, there was a mix-up

12:17.867 --> 12:19.869
and our vendor dropped all
of our frozen seafood

12:19.913 --> 12:22.306
at the Bel-Ridge store,
but it's closed down now,

12:22.350 --> 12:25.962
so it's, like, 40 pounds of
shrimp just sitting in the sun.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.269
I mean, I'd go get a truck
and pick it up myself,

12:28.312 --> 12:30.880
but I lost the feeling
in the bottom of my right foot

12:30.924 --> 12:33.317
from a medically critical case
of athlete's foot.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.797
- Oh.
Oh, no.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.800
Well, um, I mean,
I can drive a truck,

12:37.844 --> 12:40.107
but I'm gonna need somebody
to help me load it.

12:40.150 --> 12:44.328
Um, Cheyenne, why--why don't
you come with me?

12:44.372 --> 12:47.767
- Yeah, I guess, but I call
dibs on any loose shrimp.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.116
- Deal.
- I'll come, too.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.944
Girl's trip!

12:50.987 --> 12:56.297
- Um, this is more of a two-gal
shrimp job, you know?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.907
- Well, if Justine can go,

12:57.951 --> 12:59.735
I should probably stay
and finish this endcap.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.824
- No, no, no.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.305
The--the endcap can wait.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.133
I really need you, Cheyenne.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.397
I need you with me

13:09.440 --> 13:12.226
'cause you are--

13:12.269 --> 13:14.271
- Screw it!
Sandra, plan B!

13:14.315 --> 13:15.838
Hey!

13:15.882 --> 13:17.840
- I'm taking you to see Mateo.
- Sandra!

13:17.884 --> 13:20.277
- Is this entirely necessary?
- Yes.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.845
They can't stop four Mateos
from getting out of there.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.108
- But they can stop some of us?
- Ideally, no.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.458
Best case scenario,
Mateo gets out.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.069
Second best scenario,
we all get out

13:29.112 --> 13:30.461
but they keep Mateo.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.985
Third best scenario,
they keep one of us

13:32.028 --> 13:33.943
but Mateo gets out.
Fourth best scenario--

13:33.987 --> 13:35.989
- You can't have
four best scenarios!

13:36.032 --> 13:37.947
- Glenn, you have to drop this

13:37.991 --> 13:39.819
stupid vendetta
against the robot.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.996
- I hate that thing too.
It stole from me.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.260
I dropped my lotto scratcher
and it sucked it right up.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.349
- I was rushing to the men's
room 'cause I had to pee

13:48.392 --> 13:50.046
and it was blocking the way.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.266
I made it,
but a few drops came out.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.876
- Jonah, I'm just shocked.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.792
I mean, you of all people,
Mr. Labor Union,

13:56.836 --> 13:58.359
taking that thing's side!

13:58.402 --> 14:01.101
- There are no sides, guys,
okay?

14:01.144 --> 14:05.192
Amy asked me as a favor
to watch the robot, and I am.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.021
Believe me, I--I don't like
this--this automation stuff

14:08.064 --> 14:10.371
any more than you guys do.
I--I get it, you know?

14:10.414 --> 14:12.025
How can we compete
with a machine

14:12.068 --> 14:13.809
that doesn't get tired
or ask for health care

14:13.853 --> 14:15.028
or--or a raise?

14:15.071 --> 14:18.466
- I mean, uh, we can't compete.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.512
- No--
- It's the perfect employee.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.470
- That thing needs to go.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.298
all: Yeah.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.040
- Well, it's still charging so
it can't go anywhere.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.477
- Jonah, step away
from the robot.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.914
- Wait, Glenn,
what's the end game here?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.176
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Stop.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.223
- Oh.
Oh, that smells horrible.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.441
What is that?

14:37.485 --> 14:39.226
- We're sneaking Mateo out
to the sewer

14:39.269 --> 14:41.228
so we needed to get used
to being in sewage.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.969
- And because the amount
of actual sewage

14:43.012 --> 14:45.493
we could get our hands on
was disappointing,

14:45.536 --> 14:47.234
we had to come up
with a substitute.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.062
- Lucky for us,
there was a dog food recall.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.498
- And the Manhattan
Clam Chowder

14:50.541 --> 14:52.413
in the cafe didn't sell.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.458
Probably because
it smells like this.

14:54.502 --> 14:58.375
- All right, surf's up.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.030
Oh, wow.
Oh, yeah.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.250
It's chunkier than I thought.
Ooh.

15:03.293 --> 15:06.427
Oh, oh!

15:06.470 --> 15:08.429
- Dina, you are not seriously
gonna get in there.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.170
- Mm-hmm, I am.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.346
Yep, that's just what we need
to do to free Mateo.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.434
- Come on in.
The water's fine.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.959
- Oh--oh, God.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.569
Okay, you know what?
That's it, I'm out.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.006
- Okay, here he goes.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.095
He's gonna take a big dump
on our sewer.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.967
- Hey, no, I'm not gonna go
bathing in your rotten food.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.969
I understand
that you feel guilty,

15:27.013 --> 15:29.189
but breaking Mateo
out of detention is insane.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.452
Call me a bad guy.
I don't care.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.975
I'm done.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.543
- So what?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.937
Now we'd only have
three Mateos?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.852
- Two Mateos.
I'm out, too.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.377
- Huh, two Mateos.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.987
Now, that could work.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.424
- You know, I feel bad
showing up empty handed.

15:47.468 --> 15:51.254
Oh, Mateo loves the baked ziti
from Tony Rotundo's.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.561
Oh, but they're closed right
now for renovation,

15:53.604 --> 15:55.128
so I might have to...
- Cheyenne--

15:55.171 --> 15:59.393
- Wait until next month.
- Let's just go see Mateo.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.440
- Amy, I can't go
in there, okay?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.181
I'm just gonna
make things worse.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.271
It's gonna be exactly like when
I would visit my mom in jail.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.013
I would always just
break down crying.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.623
- I'm sure you didn't
make things worse for her.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.364
- No, I did.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.019
She would say, "Stop crying.
You're making things worse."

16:17.063 --> 16:20.457
- Oh, Cheyenne, your mom--
wow.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.547
Look, this is different.
Mateo wants to see you.

16:23.591 --> 16:27.638
He's--he doesn't care if you're
happy or sad or whatever.

16:27.682 --> 16:31.033
This is gonna be different.
I promise.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.992
- But what if it's not?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.603
- It will be.
- Yeah, okay.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.257
Thanks, Amy.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.260
But what if it's not?
- We're going inside now!

16:57.233 --> 16:59.844
- Hey.
How are you?

16:59.888 --> 17:03.109
- Good.
I'm good.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.329
- Okay, cool.
Well, bye.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.331
- No, Cheyenne.

17:17.645 --> 17:24.217
So, um, do you wanna hear
about all the bad outfits

17:24.260 --> 17:25.870
from the last week?

17:25.914 --> 17:28.090
I was taking photos
on my phone for you,

17:28.134 --> 17:30.266
but they wouldn't let me
bring my phone in.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.572
- Oh, my God.
Yes, please.

17:33.269 --> 17:36.620
Well, um, Justine wore her
Rosé All Day T-shirt

17:36.664 --> 17:38.709
twice in a row.
- Jesus.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.407
And I'm the one
who's locked up?

17:40.450 --> 17:41.843
Oh, God.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.628
- So, um...

17:46.195 --> 17:48.719
How are things, like, really?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.505
- Girl, it's bad in here.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.116
It's cold and there aren't
enough blankets.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.684
I mean, it is
flat out disgusting.

17:56.727 --> 18:00.166
And apparently this is one
of the nicer places.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.603
The guards think all
undocumented people are Latinos

18:02.646 --> 18:04.561
so they just keep yelling
at me in Spanish

18:04.605 --> 18:06.389
and I don't understand
what they're saying.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.610
I just--I just want to go home.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.395
- I know.
I'm so sorry.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.835
- Hey, Dina, I know I kinda

18:17.879 --> 18:18.923
went off on you
a little bit back there,

18:18.967 --> 18:21.230
but before that,
I was helping you

18:21.274 --> 18:23.189
and Marcus out a lot,
so I was thinking maybe

18:23.232 --> 18:26.192
I could get off the hook
and maybe eat my lunch again.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.759
Get back into my sandals?

18:28.803 --> 18:31.458
- Uh-huh.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.329
- Is that Mateo?

18:33.373 --> 18:35.157
Are you watching footage
from the ICE raid?

18:35.201 --> 18:36.724
- Yeah.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.726
I was just thinking maybe
if I'd had him cut left

18:38.769 --> 18:40.293
he could have doubled back
through appliances

18:40.336 --> 18:42.469
and hid in a dryer.
- Oh, stop.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.298
Jesus.
Dina, listen to me.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.865
There's nothing you could
have done about that.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.433
Maybe you're right.

18:50.477 --> 18:54.220
Oh, I just hadn't felt
like myself in a long time.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.265
Ever since you
assassinated my birds.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.353
- Well, now, hold on a second.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.485
- Come to think of it,

18:58.528 --> 19:00.487
I was way off my game that day.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.837
There's no way I could have
found him an escape route.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.708
It wasn't my fault.

19:04.752 --> 19:05.666
It was your fault.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.189
- There we go.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.712
- Yeah, this is
completely on you.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.324
Oh, I feel so much better
having discovered this.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.455
- I got it.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.196
Better turn my cameras
live again

19:14.240 --> 19:15.632
in case there's a missing kid
or something.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.852
- Oh, but this one has a timer.
That's useful.

19:17.895 --> 19:18.853
Do you think that's
more important

19:18.896 --> 19:20.507
than the self-cleaning feature?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.335
- Yeah, I don't know,
but I'm engaged to Jerry,

19:22.378 --> 19:23.684
and we're getting married,

19:23.727 --> 19:25.512
and I'm gonna wear
a gorgeous white gown,

19:25.555 --> 19:28.254
because I'm Jerry's bride
and I'm so happy,

19:28.297 --> 19:30.343
and I just
needed to tell someone.

19:30.386 --> 19:33.215
- Oh, this one makes it
right in a travel mug?

19:33.259 --> 19:34.956
Uh, yes, please.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.914
- O--okay.
Yeah.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.742
- Congratulations.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.658
- Um, Carol, I didn't know
that you were working today.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.008
- I just came
to pick up my check.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.619
- You know, now that
I think about it,

19:45.662 --> 19:47.577
Jerry's proposal
was probably a joke.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.970
You know his sick sense
of humor.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.711
- No.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.888
Even when Jerry was with me,
his heart was with you.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.282
I'm happy for you.
- Really?

19:56.325 --> 19:59.633
- Yep.
The best woman won.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.984
- No, no, no, no.
Guys, come on.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.638
Guy--no, absolutely not.
No.

20:04.681 --> 20:08.294
No robot is accidentally
going in the compactor.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.905
It's not happening.
- Jonah's right.

20:10.948 --> 20:14.517
The robot is not going
in the compactor.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.563
- Okay, so nobody
saw this happen.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.348
Somehow the robot got
onto the service elevator

20:19.392 --> 20:20.654
and made it to the roof.

20:20.697 --> 20:21.785
- I don't normally condone
the destruction

20:21.829 --> 20:23.439
of company property,

20:23.483 --> 20:24.919
but I'd like to keep
the singularity from happening

20:24.962 --> 20:26.747
for as long as possible,
so have at it.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.270
- So this whole thing about
you not wanting

20:28.314 --> 20:29.271
to make any waves--

20:29.315 --> 20:30.403
- Yeah, I don't really care

20:30.446 --> 20:31.752
what corporate thinks
right now.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.320
- Works for me.
Let's kill this thing.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.454
- About time.
Kill Glen.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.413
Kill Glen! Kill Glen!

20:40.456 --> 20:42.415
- The robot,
not the man!

20:42.458 --> 20:45.026
- The robot,
not the man!

20:45.069 --> 20:47.507
- Cheyenne,
want to do the honors?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.291
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah!

20:49.335 --> 20:50.901
- Yeah!

20:50.945 --> 20:52.555
- Bye-bye, "Westworld."

20:52.599 --> 20:53.817
- Yeah.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.732
- Ooh.
- Bye-bye.

21:02.391 --> 21:05.438
- Take that,
you hunk of junk!

21:06.787 --> 21:08.789
- Hey, hey,
guys, guys, guys.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.312
- Huh?

21:14.838 --> 21:16.405
- Holy .

21:18.494 --> 21:21.454
- Sorry, Glen!
It was an accident!
