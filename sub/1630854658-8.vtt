WEBVTT

01:08.818 --> 01:09.819
Hey!

01:10.528 --> 01:14.199
Dong-eun! I'm so sorry
we didn't get a chance to talk back there.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.952
It's too funny,
running into you out here.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.037
Great seeing you.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.708
Can… we talk real quick? Huh?

01:27.170 --> 01:28.254
Okay.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.215
This way.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.700
Please spare me.
Please spare me just once.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.121
I've made a lot of mistakes,
and I have no excuses.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.164
I won't ask you to understand.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.833
I'm incredibly sorry.

02:05.625 --> 02:09.212
I've been repenting my whole life,
and I won't stop. I swear, Dong-eun.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.506
Why are you kneeling already?

02:11.589 --> 02:13.842
I haven't even
gotten started with you yet.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.426
This is supposed to be easy.

02:16.010 --> 02:19.055
I was a child.
My family had nothing, you know?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.891
I really didn't want to do it,
but then they all…

02:22.392 --> 02:24.644
I didn't have a choice.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.980
And we were all so young back then.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.899
We all make mistakes
when we're growing up, don't we, Dong-eun?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.695
Well, okay then.
Tell me if this is a mistake.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.621
I'm a flight attendant!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.290
Are you crazy?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.922
This here is what you call "malice,"
Ms. Flight Attendant.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.593
When you're trying to hurt someone
and you know it.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.762
And you did that to me every day.

03:05.226 --> 03:10.190
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I've done something really terrible.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.649
But, please, Dong-eun,

03:12.609 --> 03:14.861
can't you please forgive me,
just this once?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.906
Please don't tell my mother-in-law
about what happened.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.240
Just stop contacting her.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.826
Just until I get married, please.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.122
I've already resigned,
so if I can't make this marriage work,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.833
I won't have any income,
and I could actually die from this!

03:31.794 --> 03:34.130
You tried your best to change your tune,

03:34.214 --> 03:36.049
but it was too fast and too clumsy.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.593
I never planned
on getting anything from you.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.303
Money, or an apology.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.139
Now you try to ask for my pity.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.058
You've tried to threaten me.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.143
What's your next great idea?

03:50.939 --> 03:51.940
Shit.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.067
What do you want?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.152
What now?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.529
What do you want from me now,
you psychotic fuck?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.408
You lost your phone, didn't you?

04:16.172 --> 04:19.550
That's it. That's the phone you lost.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.885
It was you?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.429
Myeong-o didn't send me those pictures?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.640
You're crazy!

04:25.723 --> 04:27.475
Just think, huh?

04:27.558 --> 04:30.561
Think about how much more
I know about you after looking at that.

04:32.313 --> 04:36.234
There's only one way to save yourself,
so think about it long and hard.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.735
It's what you do best.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.823
So, I don't have to
meet with your mother-in-law.

04:48.746 --> 04:53.042
I am gonna be on your side
until the day I die, Dong-eun.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.629
What do you want to do first?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.302
First, Myeong-o.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.054
Report the bastard missing.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
Hello.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.321
Thank you.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.015
Look straight ahead.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.363
Do you have something to say?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.741
Oh, no. It's just nice
to see kids laughing.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.035
It's like watching some cheesy commercial.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.496
I don't plan on getting married.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.706
Married men get
the short end of the stick.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.920
The same exact things are romance
before marriage, but cheating afterwards.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.005
-Right?
-Watch it, there are kids here.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.799
Wow, you're a great father, huh?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.718
But you're not that much fun.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.680
Ye-sol has such a great sense of humor.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.642
Wonder where she got that.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.607
-Tell me what exactly you're trying to do.
-Oh man, you're so intimidating.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.902
There are kids here, you know?

06:48.282 --> 06:49.200
Well, then.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.869
I have to see an old friend.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.836
Oh, you reach Myeong-o yet?

07:03.339 --> 07:04.674
I don't need to anymore.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.427
I found out the reason why today.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.869
<i>Can you stand there?</i>

07:32.952 --> 07:35.621
I'll kill you if you move your hand.
Stay right there.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.473
Lower your hands! I'm going to kill you.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.393
Hey, which homeroom are you in?
The bell rang hours ago!

07:57.477 --> 07:58.853
Oh shit. Fuck.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.072
I guess you drink a lot of milk, huh?
You can stop drinking now.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.786
I was right, wasn't I?
Dong-eun's boobs are fucking huge!

08:29.008 --> 08:30.009
Hey there, Dong-eun.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.933
So it looks like
Yeon-jin's pretty little pet

08:37.016 --> 08:38.976
is her daughter's homeroom teacher now.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.230
Coincidence?

08:43.981 --> 08:45.650
I guess Yeon-jin didn't tell you.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.694
I told her that it was not.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.157
If it wasn't a coincidence, then…

08:55.826 --> 08:57.495
that means you've planned everything out

08:57.578 --> 08:59.163
from when we saw you in the gym

08:59.247 --> 09:00.957
to this moment right now.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.628
That's fucking scary.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.258
I didn't realize that you were like this.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.928
I thought you'd be
playing basketball or something.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.598
Huh. Tell me, why is it
that bad feelings are always right?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.519
I don't think I can avoid this,

09:21.602 --> 09:23.062
and I can't stop you.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.358
Will all this only end
when everyone's suffered?

09:29.193 --> 09:30.778
Like that long rainy day?

09:36.325 --> 09:38.244
Hey, so you know how to get angry too?

09:40.037 --> 09:41.622
I wanted to see how much you've grown up.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.832
That's why I'm here.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.001
Oh, right.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.712
You have those scars, don't you?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.799
Did they all get better now?
Don't they feel hot?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.221
Answer my question, okay?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.481
Ah, it's still there.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.530
Let me make it all better.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.498
I'm warning you.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.084
Don't touch Yeon-jin's daughter

10:29.086 --> 10:30.046
in any way.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.972
So, did you get Ye-sol's toothbrush?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.309
I sent it to you… for urgent delivery.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.065
That was you?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.025
Let me warn you as well.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.779
Don't you help Park Yeon-jin
in any way, okay?

10:56.864 --> 10:59.575
If you really want Ye-sol,
then I'm your ally.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.993
Not Yeon-jin. All right?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.665
And you might not be aware of this,

11:07.291 --> 11:09.043
but I was somebody's daughter.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.004
Right, Jae-jun?

11:23.808 --> 11:25.226
My mom told me

11:27.269 --> 11:29.271
I should always listen to the teacher.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.193
It was great seeing you.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.740
This is for you.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.418
HA YE-SOL

12:50.811 --> 12:52.980
A parents' day? Today?

12:53.063 --> 12:56.108
Yeah. There were
a lot of dads in the classroom,

12:56.192 --> 12:58.235
but Dad was for sure the coolest one.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.821
Ye-sol! Why do you
keep breaking your promise?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.573
I want to know everything about school,

13:02.656 --> 13:05.534
and everything that your teacher
says or does to you. Remember that?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.953
You should have told me about
something like that, Ye-sol!

13:08.537 --> 13:11.123
I told you when we were
eating dinner before.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.502
I said that all the dads
were coming one day.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.464
Oh, I'm just all over
the place these days. I'm sorry.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.593
Did your dad talk with your teacher
when he was there?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.094
Did they greet each other?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.679
No. They didn't.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.099
Oh, but Dad talked
with Uncle Jae-jun after class.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.646
Uncle Jae-jun was at school?
Why was he in your classroom, though?

13:55.459 --> 13:58.212
I was pretty excited
when you asked me out for a meal.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.631
I mean, I was curious what you wanted.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.094
I must say, this is a surprise.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.096
What do you mean with it?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.639
It doesn't mean much.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.309
It's like a fruit basket.
I didn't want to come empty-handed.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.728
I asked Gyeong-tae for your info and such.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.438
I hope you're not uncomfortable.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.191
I'm not uncomfortable, just nervous.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.444
This is definitely my style, sir.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.700
You know Moon Dong-eun?

14:33.914 --> 14:37.543
To be exact, I'd like you to tell me about
the relationship between my wife and her.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.882
Wait, how do you even know Moon Dong-eun?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.009
We play Go together.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.929
Wow.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.182
Wow. It's a small world, isn't it?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.185
Does Yeon-jin know you're meeting me?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.521
No, I don't plan on telling her.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.615
There's really not much to say
about Yeon-jin and Dong-eun.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.284
We all went to the same high school,

15:10.367 --> 15:13.203
and Yeon-jin bullied
Dong-eun a lot back in the day.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.837
Was this bullying violent?

15:21.921 --> 15:24.798
It wasn't just violent, okay?
It was way more.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.053
How bad?

15:30.387 --> 15:31.305
Really bad.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.324
We're in the same homeroom,
but we've never spoken.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.533
Right, Dong-eun?

15:52.701 --> 15:53.869
What do you need from me?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.746
You won't say hi back?

15:56.413 --> 15:57.414
Okay, then.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.333
I don't need anything.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.836
Except I really don't like
the smell of bleach, so do me a favor.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.757
Because it's already my turn
to clean the bathroom again.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.468
Okay?

16:10.511 --> 16:11.345
Wait, what?

16:11.428 --> 16:14.348
You know exactly what I mean.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.310
Does it hurt your pride less
if you don't answer right away?

16:19.645 --> 16:23.315
Anyway, can you just go ahead
and clean the bathroom for me?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.360
Another friend of mine
used to help me do that until last week,

16:26.443 --> 16:27.778
but she transferred.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.530
So-hee transferred?

16:29.613 --> 16:30.447
I guess.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.160
Now I guess we have to find out
wherever that girl went.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.537
Come on, answer me.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.415
I really want to hear your voice,
Dong-eun. Come on.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.710
What will you do if I…

16:44.795 --> 16:45.921
if I say no to you?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.216
I like when people answer immediately.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.384
I don't like to wait.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.427
So, what?

16:52.219 --> 16:53.178
You won't do it?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.434
Hmm.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.978
This won't do.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.564
Hey, Myeong-o.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.025
You can't even wait one minute?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.491
That was how it started.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.039
It ended with Dong-eun
dropping out of school.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.500
You can hear the rest from Yeon-jin.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.919
It's a pretty searing story.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.633
So Dong-eun wasn't
the first one this happened to?

17:32.843 --> 17:36.221
Sounds like you and your wife
don't talk much.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.723
So, try it out today.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.017
I've got to get going.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.773
Can I ask you for a small favor?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.650
When you see Moon Dong-eun,

17:48.734 --> 17:51.487
can you please tell her
I told you all this stuff?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.114
Thank you.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.248
Is that the only gambling you do?

18:04.792 --> 18:07.336
One time,
I bet my whole life on something.

18:08.087 --> 18:08.921
Did you win?

18:10.422 --> 18:11.256
I plan to.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.109
Ah!

18:30.901 --> 18:31.860
Oh, come on.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.238
Don't try so hard to beat an old man.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.199
You should let him go again.
One more game.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.952
He can redo his last move, right?

18:40.035 --> 18:43.122
He's very skilled
for someone so young, huh?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.456
Sure.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.167
Well, sadly, I've lost this match, sir.

18:49.086 --> 18:49.920
Here you go.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.631
I have to meet a friend.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.592
There you are.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.095
Let's go.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.014
I'm your friend?

19:01.098 --> 19:03.934
-Sure.
-Who's playing?

19:04.017 --> 19:07.104
Please help me out.
I played three rounds against four people.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.709
Does your wife get annoyed
when you come here and play Go?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.253
I'm sure I annoy her often.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.216
Do they still sell those?

19:37.467 --> 19:42.222
Oh. I got an invitation from someone,
so I brought it. I hope she could like it.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.641
You two are adorable.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.776
I guess you have
a real friend you want to hear from.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.363
I have an important call to make.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.199
But I need to organize my thoughts.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.290
Do you live nearby?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.043
Oh, I just moved here, pretty recently.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.004
Semyeong is a good choice.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.964
The air is still nice around here.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.177
Oh, I didn't move here
for any logical reasons.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.429
I need to get revenge for someone.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.018
Revenge in South Korea?

20:28.101 --> 20:30.687
That won't be easy. You can't use a gun.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.484
Although about half the country
knows how to shoot one, don't they?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.404
You can use knives, can't you?

20:40.989 --> 20:43.116
You need to get up close and personal,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.494
so you feel it as you go in.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.914
You need to be so close to the person

20:48.997 --> 20:52.501
that you see your eyes
reflected in theirs, and--

21:00.801 --> 21:02.803
Oh! I'm sorry!

21:03.679 --> 21:07.349
I've been watching Netflix all day
because I don't have any patients.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.559
Right.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.397
I opened up a practice.
You should drop by.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.401
I have a lot of male patients too,
so don't feel uncomfortable.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.195
Best of luck.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.698
Just hope I can pay rent.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.116
Your revenge.

21:25.158 --> 21:25.993
Ah.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.454
I'll definitely need some of that as well.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.376
<i>He was pretty tall.</i>

21:35.544 --> 21:39.589
About 179 centimeters, and 77 kilograms.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.092
You're tall too.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.137
I wish I were the only tall guy here.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.891
His watch, his shoes, his cologne…

21:51.768 --> 21:54.438
They were all just right.
Not too much or too little.

21:54.938 --> 21:55.939
It was like

21:57.149 --> 22:00.235
opening to the 17th page
of the January issue of <i>GQ.</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:08.994
So, my mom and dad were always
weird about my birthday.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.121
And it's on January 16th.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.374
They always said it was hard
to figure out what to get me,

22:14.458 --> 22:16.001
so senior year of high school,

22:17.085 --> 22:21.048
they told me they'd pick something
on the 16th page of GQ every January.

22:22.966 --> 22:26.261
Sometimes a book,
sometimes a coffee machine.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.889
And sometimes,
I even got a sports car out of it.

22:30.390 --> 22:34.311
But I still don't understand
why that makes him the 17th page.

22:35.812 --> 22:39.274
When you flip to the 16th page,
you can always see the 17th page too.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.569
Sometimes, you find
something even better on that page.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.031
So, what I'm saying is this.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.368
I was annoyed
because he was so cool, okay?

22:49.451 --> 22:51.119
Making myself look like an idiot.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.964
Did you get a call?

23:04.257 --> 23:08.345
Not yet. I thought he'd call me
after the parent observation class,

23:08.428 --> 23:10.263
but no, he hasn't called yet.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.851
He probably doesn't like it right now
because he has no control over it.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.354
He just seemed like that type.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.108
I bet he'll reach out on Friday,

23:21.191 --> 23:24.486
after he finishes up with his work,
cancels all of his plans,

23:24.986 --> 23:28.407
and rehearses his questions for you
in his head. Then he'll call you.

23:45.465 --> 23:49.094
So, where have you been all day?
You weren't answering my texts.

23:51.763 --> 23:52.764
Where's Ye-sol?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.976
Don't you know what time it is?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.562
Maybe I should learn

23:59.312 --> 24:01.148
how to play Go too.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.232
You think?

24:03.692 --> 24:05.235
Let me ask you something.

24:06.153 --> 24:06.987
Huh?

24:07.696 --> 24:10.532
Are you friends with Ye-sol's teacher?

24:13.076 --> 24:16.371
Is she the teacher
you told me you don't like?

24:19.332 --> 24:21.334
I heard you went to observe the class.

24:21.418 --> 24:25.922
You know, she misunderstood
something about me.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.510
As you probably saw,
she and I are from different worlds.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.223
But we talked about it, and it's fine.
Why? What'd she say?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.018
She should have said something?

24:41.438 --> 24:42.689
How did you talk it out?

24:44.065 --> 24:47.736
You called her a crazy bitch
when you first told me.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.864
Did you mean she might try to hurt Ye-sol?

24:50.947 --> 24:52.657
So you wanted to send her abroad?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.204
Baby.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.208
We dated for two years
and have been married for ten.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.792
That's 12 years in total.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.419
And after all that time,

25:04.503 --> 25:06.630
you have to trust me
that everything will be fine.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.132
Don't scold me like that, you know?

25:10.675 --> 25:13.386
No matter what you've heard
or what anyone says to you,

25:13.470 --> 25:14.804
do not listen to them.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.643
You know, whenever you choose something,

25:20.393 --> 25:24.231
you always choose the thing
that's more appealing and shinier,

25:24.314 --> 25:25.190
don't you?

25:25.690 --> 25:27.526
Our marriage is one of those things.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.861
You like my body,

25:29.945 --> 25:31.321
you like my voice,

25:31.821 --> 25:33.031
the jokes I make,

25:33.114 --> 25:34.449
my background.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.493
You like all of it.

25:38.161 --> 25:41.081
So don't try to open a box
that should stay closed up.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.710
I love you so much, babe.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.172
I don't want you
to find out about this, okay?

25:50.674 --> 25:54.719
I'll make sure that nothing inside
that box comes out into the world.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.930
And I'll make sure that Ye-sol stays safe.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.015
So come on, baby.

25:59.975 --> 26:05.063
Can you just let me and Ye-sol
shine like we do now, huh?

26:05.647 --> 26:06.648
Please, honey?

26:10.944 --> 26:13.196
I promise this box isn't shiny at all.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.420
I'm so jealous.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.013
I shouldn't even be eating stew.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.056
The shaman told me
to lose three kilograms.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.934
Why? I thought
you just needed compatible fortunes.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.436
That's 'cause you're skinny.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.231
I still haven't found a good guy,
even if I'm skinny.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.734
It must be nice to have
such a good fortune.

26:50.817 --> 26:54.321
Isn't that old guy you matched with,
like, very lucky and fortunate?

26:55.697 --> 26:58.116
Well… I guess it's not that bad.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.412
I have earth in my fortunes,
but I think he doesn't.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.540
So that's important too?
That's so cool.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.084
I wonder what my fortunes are.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.589
Thank you so much.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.966
-Hi there.
-Thanks, have a good day.

27:20.555 --> 27:24.309
That scar is taking some time to heal.
It's been a while, right?

27:24.392 --> 27:25.769
Want a new Band-Aid?

27:28.396 --> 27:31.024
Just don't get any more
sponsored products from them.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.652
My feet are getting all scratched!

27:41.201 --> 27:43.328
<i>Come out.</i>
<i>I'm in the parking lot.</i>

27:46.748 --> 27:49.084
What are you even talking about?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.919
-Just end it.
-Just end what?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.212
Just end it with your husband.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.507
I want to be Ye-sol's father.

27:56.549 --> 27:57.717
And you'll get a new husband.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.390
You're fucking insane. Is this why
you showed up at Ye-sol's school?

28:03.473 --> 28:04.891
Don't change the subject.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.311
Do you really love him?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.022
You and your husband
can't even talk about Dong-eun.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.442
You don't even know if Do-yeong
will take your side or not.

28:15.110 --> 28:19.072
Oh, or maybe you don't talk about it
because you know he won't take your side.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.075
But I know all about it.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.161
And I've still always been there for you.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.247
Right here.

28:28.915 --> 28:29.999
Isn't this love?

28:32.794 --> 28:34.045
Is that love to you?

28:34.754 --> 28:35.588
Yeah.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.216
Even if we didn't know it's love.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.761
Don't you think?

28:44.097 --> 28:45.098
I guess.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.602
You know, I've never actually
thought about it.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.188
I love you so much, babe.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.524
I don't want you
to find out about this, okay?

29:00.697 --> 29:02.198
Right? So, why don't we--

29:02.282 --> 29:03.950
Oh, I really do, though.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.787
I really love him, you know.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.917
I've loved him all along.

29:22.218 --> 29:24.345
<i>If I'm being honest, Yeon-jin,</i>

29:24.429 --> 29:26.973
<i>I find myself smiling recently,</i>

29:27.474 --> 29:29.559
<i>imagining the future.</i>

29:29.642 --> 29:33.480
<i>Myeong-o never left the country,</i>
<i>and nobody can reach him.</i>

29:34.647 --> 29:36.316
<i>Maybe everything happening now</i>

29:37.192 --> 29:39.527
<i>will finally lead to your true confession.</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:44.032
<i>Maybe all this cover-up</i>

29:44.115 --> 29:45.784
<i>is trying to hide something else.</i>

29:46.284 --> 29:49.287
<i>Something that will</i>
<i>make all this even worse.</i>

29:55.043 --> 29:58.296
Here you go, ma'am.
The hydrogen peroxide is inside.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.714
Have you been hurt?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.925
Just leave it here and go.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.009
Of course.

30:10.433 --> 30:15.730
<i>I've been so excited thinking</i>
<i>that maybe by covering up your tracks,</i>

30:15.814 --> 30:19.484
<i>you've now opened Pandora's box.</i>

30:23.154 --> 30:24.906
CHIEF SHIN YEONG-JUN

30:27.450 --> 30:28.284
Yes, hello?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.870
Do you have some time tomorrow afternoon?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.706
I have a few things that you asked for.

30:40.713 --> 30:43.132
I have everything
after she dropped out of school.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.844
Worked at the factory,
all the way up to Semyeong Elementary.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.805
And it's all clean.
No fines, no unpaid insurance bills.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.892
She's a model citizen.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.187
What about her mother? Where is she?

30:56.271 --> 30:57.772
Jeong Mi-hui?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.190
You need that too?

30:59.774 --> 31:01.985
It worked pretty well in high school.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.862
The poorer you are…

31:06.114 --> 31:07.949
the more harmful your family is.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.870
PREPARATION TIME
15:00-17:00

31:36.936 --> 31:38.980
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>who was in that picture?</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:43.735
I could recognize most of them
after you explained to me,

31:44.694 --> 31:45.820
but I couldn't recognize her.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.491
The woman on the left,
the one who was wearing the red apron?

31:54.621 --> 31:55.622
<i>That's my mom.</i>

31:58.207 --> 32:02.045
You want to know what her picture's
doing there with the perpetrators?

32:03.796 --> 32:07.467
Well,
can I ask you something else?

32:07.550 --> 32:10.178
Uh, do you wash your sheets often?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.014
Yeah.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.016
Mmm.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.938
Can I ask you a question too?

32:20.021 --> 32:23.107
Ah. So you want to know
something about me now?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.442
Like what?

32:25.485 --> 32:28.655
3-7-2-4. Why is that your door code?

32:30.490 --> 32:33.785
Usually, it's a birthday
or a license number,

32:33.868 --> 32:36.663
or sometimes the day
you first met someone.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.666
But I can't figure out what yours is.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.799
Can I persuade you to ask something else?

33:06.025 --> 33:07.944
<i>3724, you have a visitor.</i>

33:15.702 --> 33:17.036
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.873
After staying here for a while,

33:22.625 --> 33:26.462
I've realized I did something terrible,
and no matter how…

33:27.046 --> 33:30.883
no matter how many times I apologize,
I know that my sin won't be forgiven.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.969
And I can't undo what I've done.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.596
I did not know.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.057
What?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.267
I didn't know…

33:41.269 --> 33:43.146
that a murderous monster like you

33:43.771 --> 33:46.190
had been sending letters
directly to my son

33:47.817 --> 33:48.985
this entire time.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.030
Yes. I was mentally unstable, and I--

33:52.113 --> 33:54.490
Didn't manage to withstand
the social pressures

33:54.574 --> 33:56.576
and made an unfortunate mistake?

33:58.369 --> 34:01.581
Don't give me that bullshit.
Your letters all say the same thing.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.334
Yes, I did.

34:08.171 --> 34:11.049
I, uh… I'm not very good at writing.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.717
Shut your goddamned mouth!

34:12.800 --> 34:17.096
How dare you? You're messing with my son
to get a reduced sentence, you asshole.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.016
How could you dare
send him back to that hell?

34:21.100 --> 34:23.436
A man like you will never be forgiven.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.855
So if you ever send my son a letter again…

34:27.857 --> 34:28.900
I will kill you.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.197
But you're a doctor.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.241
What?

34:43.039 --> 34:45.625
Your family are all doctors.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.586
None of you can kill people.

34:50.171 --> 34:53.966
I mean, your husband got killed
because he agreed to an oath like that.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.805
I'm not doing this
because I want to get out.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.348
I've grown to like it here.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.267
They give me three meals every day,

35:03.351 --> 35:06.062
and I get to have fresh air
and medical attention too.

35:06.646 --> 35:10.525
Then why'd you
send my son those letters, huh?

35:11.859 --> 35:13.361
Because I was bored.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.370
So your poor son really went to hell?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.124
You son of a bitch!

35:50.148 --> 35:52.150
HA YE-SOL

36:22.471 --> 36:23.306
Hello?

36:27.393 --> 36:28.227
Where?

36:29.270 --> 36:30.688
Jongno Station?

36:31.689 --> 36:34.775
Who was it? You? Or you?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.861
Who the fuck reported Myeong-o missing?!

36:38.529 --> 36:39.697
Maybe Yeon-jin?

36:40.489 --> 36:42.617
She said to report it, so…

36:43.117 --> 36:45.328
She would never do something that stupid.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.164
That leaves you. Was it?

36:48.748 --> 36:52.501
I got the call first
'cause I'm his boss, but he's an adult.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.004
They'll categorize him
as a runaway at most.

36:55.087 --> 36:57.006
The special forces
aren't gonna come running

36:57.089 --> 37:00.343
just because some 36-year-old man
isn't picking up his calls, Sa-ra.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.804
So it was you.
You started looking for Myeong-o first.

37:03.888 --> 37:04.972
You think it's me?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.017
What about you? Why are you not a suspect?

37:09.810 --> 37:10.895
It's you.

37:12.021 --> 37:15.441
It was you.
Of course it was, you bitch.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.693
Should I call the cops and check?

37:23.199 --> 37:24.825
It was me. You're right.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.494
I reported it.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.371
But who cares?

37:29.538 --> 37:31.415
You said he could've died somewhere.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.793
What if he's actually dead right now?

37:34.835 --> 37:37.713
Am I really the weird one here
for reporting him missing?

37:38.506 --> 37:42.260
-He lives alone, aren't you worried?
-This fucking bitch is crazy.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.055
Since when have you
cared so much about Myeong-o?

37:46.889 --> 37:50.768
Oh, it makes more sense
why he asked you out.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.771
Did you sleep with him too?

37:53.854 --> 37:55.106
Huh? Huh?

37:55.189 --> 37:57.024
What the fuck are you even saying?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.526
He asked her out?

38:00.736 --> 38:03.364
Your vagina has always been
shared property, right?

38:03.864 --> 38:06.575
Hey, you did it on purpose,
didn't you? What do you want?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.911
You know I bought drugs from him

38:08.995 --> 38:12.164
and got prescriptions under his name
for a few years, don't you?

38:12.248 --> 38:13.749
You're aware of that?

38:13.833 --> 38:16.752
When they start investigating,
I'll be the first one they'll catch,

38:16.836 --> 38:19.171
so why the fuck did you make that report?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.589
God, TMI, ladies.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.592
-I'm leaving.
-Let go.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.469
Let go now!

38:25.553 --> 38:27.138
Let me fucking go!

38:27.221 --> 38:30.891
Listen. If any of the cops
start calling me,

38:30.975 --> 38:33.686
then I'm really going to fucking kill you,

38:33.769 --> 38:35.438
you stupid bitch!

38:38.649 --> 38:40.651
EARLY MORNING DELIVERY

38:40.735 --> 38:43.571
What is this? Is it kimchi?

38:44.947 --> 38:46.032
It's not.

38:50.036 --> 38:53.956
Deposit the won and dollars separately,
and get proof of your average balance.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.752
What… What is all of this?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.380
Did you get a passport for Sun-a?

39:01.464 --> 39:03.674
Huh? Oh.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.676
Uh, it's here…

39:07.470 --> 39:09.305
Why do you need a passport?

39:11.307 --> 39:14.685
This is for the study agency.
Please sign these papers.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.733
I'm going to send Sun-a to study abroad.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.362
Abroad?

39:25.154 --> 39:27.239
I'm trying to start the rest of my plans.

39:27.948 --> 39:31.869
I'll do what you asked, as soon as
she gets to leave the country safely.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.955
In the United States,

39:35.831 --> 39:38.000
she will hear the news about her father.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.005
I lied to you.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.426
You won't get to have
a lovely dinner together.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.932
You're going to lose Sun-a if we do this.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.645
But I promise that Sun-a will be safe

39:59.063 --> 40:00.689
from her father who beats her

40:02.149 --> 40:05.694
and her mother who wants him killed.

40:10.991 --> 40:13.119
That's the reality of what we're planning.

40:15.621 --> 40:16.622
If you want to stop,

40:18.290 --> 40:19.708
then tell me now, please.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.890
EDEN APARTMENTS

40:34.974 --> 40:36.725
Is this really the right address?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.644
This is where she lives?

40:39.228 --> 40:40.187
Yeah. It is.

40:40.813 --> 40:44.108
She was reported to have moved in
before Semyeong Elementary. Why?

40:45.401 --> 40:47.194
This is really the place where…

40:49.196 --> 40:50.281
that bitch is living?

40:50.364 --> 40:52.491
UNIT 301, EDEN APARTMENTS
71 SEMYEONG STREET, SEMYEONG

40:52.575 --> 40:53.993
71 SEMYEONG STREET

40:57.705 --> 40:59.331
It's right in front of my house.

41:29.945 --> 41:32.990
-<i>Good evening, sir.</i>
-A personal matter's come up.

41:34.116 --> 41:36.785
Cancel everything.
Clear my schedule till Tuesday.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.539
And text me if anything urgent comes up.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.249
<i>Yes, sir, right away.</i>

41:42.333 --> 41:44.043
<i>-Do you need anything else?</i>
-That'll be all.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.639
Where are you?

41:58.057 --> 41:59.183
Let's meet somewhere.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.921
How much can I win per house?

42:31.173 --> 42:32.174
Heh.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.638
You must have a lot of questions.
So, go for it.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.560
Aren't you cold? Your clothes look thin.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.775
I thought your first question would be
if I approached you on purpose.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.361
Well, I wanted to be
unpredictable for once.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.658
What would you have done
if I hadn't called?

42:58.242 --> 42:59.910
Held a parent teacher conference.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.745
What if I'd made a complaint against you?

43:01.829 --> 43:04.498
It's a private school,
and I'm influential.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.583
I know.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.252
I know all about your influence.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.629
I'm depending on it.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.972
The man who taught me
how to play Go was a lawyer who said to me

43:20.598 --> 43:23.767
that I was born holding the black stone,
and it was easy for me.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.813
So I've always held
a certain advantage over others.

43:29.189 --> 43:30.524
But this match right here…

43:33.319 --> 43:34.486
is a tough one.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.079
I have questions for you and Yeon-jin.

43:45.205 --> 43:48.792
But… I want to hear you out here first.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.421
But why?

43:53.589 --> 43:55.591
Because you claim you're a victim.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.887
Oh, are you here already?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.223
Yeah. Unit 301.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.893
How long will it take to unlock this door?

44:56.151 --> 44:58.153
This is illegal, by the way.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.782
If it were legal, you wouldn't get this.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.621
Are you… on TV?

45:07.705 --> 45:09.998
The weathercaster? Park Yeon-jin?

45:10.582 --> 45:14.294
If I was, do you think
this agreement might change?

46:27.159 --> 46:29.995
Open it. And then wait here for me.

46:30.662 --> 46:31.497
What?

46:33.165 --> 46:34.416
Ugh, fine.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.838
You went to school with Yeon-jin.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.133
So, did you approach me on purpose?

46:44.384 --> 46:45.219
Yeah.

46:49.014 --> 46:49.848
Does that mean…

46:52.142 --> 46:53.852
you learned to play Go on purpose?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.147
That's how it started.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.525
But then I really liked it.

47:00.859 --> 47:03.529
In the game of Go, you're building houses.

47:04.029 --> 47:07.491
I had dreamed of being an architect
until I had to leave school.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.335
Were you also the one who sent me this?

47:19.169 --> 47:21.630
I made sure to pick out
the ones you look good in.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.257
It doesn't look like it.

47:25.217 --> 47:26.385
So, where do you live?

47:27.469 --> 47:30.389
If you approached me,
you must live pretty close by, right?

47:33.183 --> 47:34.518
I've braced myself.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.898
Even if you've done that,

47:39.982 --> 47:42.150
cruelty like this hurts a lot.

47:44.570 --> 47:45.571
I know that well.

48:04.339 --> 48:05.674
I slipped up.

48:09.428 --> 48:11.722
I really shouldn't have
bullied that bitch.

48:15.475 --> 48:17.477
I should have just killed her back then.

48:51.803 --> 48:53.305
