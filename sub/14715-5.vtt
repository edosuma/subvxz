00:00.200 --> 00:01.686
Previously on "Greenleaf"...

00:01.753 --> 00:03.606
When you're the response pastor,

00:03.680 --> 00:05.780
you are the face of the
church with a capital "C."

00:05.782 --> 00:08.450
- So, how'd she look?
- She's got nothing on you.

00:08.452 --> 00:10.985
So when we start getting all upset

00:10.987 --> 00:13.388
at our friends and our parents,

00:13.390 --> 00:15.390
the one you should turn to is God.

00:15.392 --> 00:17.992
Every time we fly, it's the same thing.

00:17.994 --> 00:19.728
We just sit here for hours.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.993
Let's take a pregnancy test.

00:22.018 --> 00:25.366
- Just so we're clear, I give.
- What do you mean?

00:25.368 --> 00:27.502
- Therapy.
- Just because I don't talk

00:27.504 --> 00:29.170
doesn't mean I'm not getting
something out of it.

00:29.172 --> 00:31.372
Bishop, it is with a heavy heart

00:31.374 --> 00:34.375
that I pitch my tent across from
yours in the field of battle.

00:34.377 --> 00:36.911
You started something here, Pastor.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.313
You're gonna let me finish.

00:38.315 --> 00:40.445
Here at Calvary, we're family!

00:43.219 --> 00:46.020
Downtown Memphis
high today will be 63 degrees

00:46.022 --> 00:48.690
with showers expected to
continue throughout the week.

00:48.692 --> 00:50.792
Showers will be heavy at times...

00:50.794 --> 00:52.160
Sophia?

00:59.401 --> 01:01.302
Sophia?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.972
Good morning, little saints.

01:37.974 --> 01:39.874
Good morning, Pastor.

01:39.876 --> 01:41.409
Did anyone here
happen to see the rainbow

01:41.411 --> 01:42.811
on the way into church today?

01:42.813 --> 01:45.346
I did! I did!

01:45.348 --> 01:47.782
When I saw that
rainbow, I thought the Lord...

01:47.784 --> 01:49.219
...is definitely looking

01:49.244 --> 01:50.218
out for me today.

01:50.220 --> 01:52.554
Because today we're gonna
talk about a Bible story

01:52.556 --> 01:54.522
that ends with a rainbow!

01:54.524 --> 01:56.562
Can you believe that?

01:58.839 --> 01:59.839
Where did you get this?

01:59.841 --> 02:01.474
Your phone's ringing.

02:01.476 --> 02:02.809
What?

02:02.811 --> 02:04.175
Your phone.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.080
Baby, where'd you get that?

02:07.082 --> 02:08.747
Faith's room.

02:11.285 --> 02:12.652
Hello, this is Pastor Greenleaf.

02:13.051 --> 02:14.853
No, darling, it's never too early.

02:16.458 --> 02:17.824
Yep, I'm on my way.

02:20.226 --> 02:22.429
Let her do what she's going to do.

02:22.431 --> 02:23.992
Just go and see her.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.297
- Mm-hmm.
- Make the peace.

02:27.069 --> 02:28.101
Mm-hmm.

02:28.103 --> 02:30.103
She's been with us 40 years.

02:30.105 --> 02:32.439
Yes, and familiarity has bred contempt.

02:32.441 --> 02:34.007
- But, James...
- No "Thank you, Connie Sykes."

02:34.009 --> 02:35.041
- No, we've...
- Hey, now.

02:35.043 --> 02:37.043
- What?
- Mmm.

02:39.381 --> 02:40.923
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:41.416 --> 02:43.383
I got to see a man about a jet.

02:45.020 --> 02:45.952
Oh.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.891
♪ Amen

02:55.930 --> 02:57.297
♪ Amen

03:05.739 --> 03:06.873
♪ Well

03:19.553 --> 03:22.689
♪ Amen, amen, ooh.

03:37.081 --> 03:38.515
How's that feeling, Charity?

03:39.129 --> 03:39.849
A little cold.

03:39.851 --> 03:41.217
Yeah. Sorry about that.

03:44.777 --> 03:47.623
Is that the baby's heartbeat?

03:47.625 --> 03:51.068
Mm-hmm, and it sounds very healthy.

03:53.230 --> 03:55.832
I think it sounds like a girl.

03:55.834 --> 03:59.069
- Ahh. Boy.
- Uh-huh.

04:00.238 --> 04:04.594
- Oh.
- What's wrong?

04:04.734 --> 04:06.344
Nothing's wrong.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.361
It's just...

04:08.205 --> 04:10.857
I think your little friend in there

04:11.575 --> 04:13.121
has a little friend.

04:13.897 --> 04:16.545
- We're having twins?
- Yes, sir.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.779
Congratulations.

04:17.781 --> 04:19.947
Oh, my God.

04:19.950 --> 04:21.116
Kevin.

04:28.925 --> 04:30.759
Oh, my God.

04:32.795 --> 04:34.029
Kerissa, he's my best friend.

04:34.031 --> 04:35.364
And I'm your wife.

04:35.366 --> 04:36.498
It's his bachelor party.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.787
And this is my life.

04:37.789 --> 04:39.368
Do you care about our marriage at all?

04:39.370 --> 04:40.030
I do.

04:40.971 --> 04:43.939
I count on it to be a place
of support from which I...

04:43.941 --> 04:45.807
To fly off to Vegas to stuff
twenties in some stripper's...

04:45.809 --> 04:49.945
No, from which I can do
whatever occurs to me to do.

04:49.947 --> 04:52.548
Oh, well, that's the truth right there.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.867
Damn right it's the truth.

04:53.869 --> 04:55.565
- Jacob? - You see what I'm up against?

04:56.320 --> 04:57.722
Are you still seeing this other woman?

04:57.724 --> 04:59.988
I told you, we're not
gonna talk about that.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.391
Okay, but would you agree with me

05:02.393 --> 05:03.926
if I said that Kerissa's concerns

05:03.928 --> 05:05.561
about this trip to Las Vegas

05:05.563 --> 05:07.563
are exacerbated by her knowledge

05:07.565 --> 05:08.764
that you're still seeing this woman?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.077
Cool.

05:11.368 --> 05:12.367
I'll tell you what.

05:12.369 --> 05:14.021
What?

05:14.796 --> 05:16.505
I'll give her the Heisman.

05:18.554 --> 05:20.915
- You won't do that.
- You let me go to Vegas.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.618
Kerissa, could that work for you?

05:24.947 --> 05:26.947
But Jacob gives up this woman?

05:30.253 --> 05:31.549
If he actually does it.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.190
Aces.

05:39.629 --> 05:41.196
So, that might be something

05:41.198 --> 05:44.199
we want to consider as we move forward.

05:44.201 --> 05:47.202
- Excuse me?
- Pastor Greenleaf.

05:47.204 --> 05:48.937
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all.

05:48.939 --> 05:51.406
Thank you so much for coming.

05:51.408 --> 05:52.975
Of course, of course.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.910
You're Bishop's eldest, aren't you?

05:54.912 --> 05:56.345
Yes, I am.

05:56.347 --> 05:58.312
We were so sorry to hear
about your sister Faith.

05:59.583 --> 06:00.715
That was terrible.

06:01.385 --> 06:02.383
Thank you.

06:09.759 --> 06:12.160
Joshua says all superheroes

06:12.162 --> 06:13.495
need to build their strength sometimes.

06:16.966 --> 06:18.734
That sounds totally true.

06:18.736 --> 06:19.735
I'll come back in a few minutes.

06:19.737 --> 06:20.623
Oh.

06:21.639 --> 06:23.536
So, what's the problem?

06:24.241 --> 06:27.042
- Joshua was born premature.
- At 25 weeks.

06:27.044 --> 06:28.477
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

06:28.479 --> 06:30.703
We have a picture of Bishop

06:31.048 --> 06:33.649
holding him right in
the palm of his hand.

06:33.651 --> 06:35.250
Bishop didn't tell you about Joshua?

06:35.607 --> 06:38.854
No, I was somewhere else.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.057
Well, he had a lot of
challenges when he was born,

06:42.059 --> 06:45.227
one of which is what's
called a malrotated bowel.

06:45.229 --> 06:47.796
Half of his intestines
are dead inside of there,

06:47.798 --> 06:51.099
so they have to go in, take it
out right away, or he'll die.

06:51.101 --> 06:53.607
- I'm so sorry.
- Why?

06:54.430 --> 06:57.538
- It's all in God's plan.
- Arthur, stop talking like that.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.307
Your son's got enough troubles.

06:59.309 --> 07:01.309
Wouldn't have any troubles at all

07:01.311 --> 07:03.011
if you hadn't dragged Bishop
in this in the first place.

07:03.353 --> 07:04.479
If you'll excuse us,

07:04.481 --> 07:06.948
the surgeons need
to explain the procedure.

07:06.950 --> 07:08.216
Of course.

07:08.218 --> 07:09.851
Don't mind my husband, please.

07:09.853 --> 07:13.088
He's... he's upset.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.923
Bishop's never been
anything but a godsend.

07:14.925 --> 07:16.730
It's not a problem.

07:33.897 --> 07:37.700
This one's out
of your price range normally.

07:37.702 --> 07:41.104
But because we financed the purchase
through our in-house broker,

07:41.106 --> 07:45.508
when the previous owner became
unable to make the payments...

07:45.510 --> 07:46.676
What happened?

07:46.678 --> 07:48.678
Well, I'm not at liberty to say,

07:48.680 --> 07:51.114
but here it is from another angle.

07:51.116 --> 07:53.049
Was that Damon Kinchloe's?

07:53.051 --> 07:55.218
I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.486
We've been on that jet.

07:56.488 --> 07:57.887
Was this Pastor Kinchloe's jet?

07:57.889 --> 08:00.056
The point is,
I'm able to offer it to you

08:00.058 --> 08:01.563
at a considerable discount.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.310
That's the jet he flew us down
to Kevin Copeland's place.

08:03.312 --> 08:04.994
- That's the one.
- That's a hell of a jet.

08:04.996 --> 08:06.195
- Uh-huh.
- That's all I'm saying.

08:06.197 --> 08:07.630
And if you want it today,

08:07.632 --> 08:09.798
all you have to do
is take over the payments.

08:15.072 --> 08:17.640
You got yourself a deal.

08:17.642 --> 08:19.275
- That's a hell of a jet.
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.277 --> 08:21.906
And the scores last year
from the lower school,

08:22.013 --> 08:25.281
and I wish this could go without saying,

08:25.283 --> 08:27.083
were even more disappointing.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.843
We can't call ourselves Excellence,

08:31.456 --> 08:34.690
charge what we charge, and
be this close to the bottom.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.291
I don't care if you have to administer

08:36.294 --> 08:37.659
those prep tests a dozen times

08:37.662 --> 08:38.693
between now and next Friday.

08:38.696 --> 08:40.062
Get it right.

08:40.298 --> 08:42.832
- Teach the test.
- Headmistress?

08:43.672 --> 08:44.566
What, Isabel?

08:44.876 --> 08:46.636
We know these tests are biased.

08:47.211 --> 08:49.475
Life is biased.

08:50.275 --> 08:53.276
You want to change the test,
go into public policy.

08:53.278 --> 08:55.187
You want to teach at this school,

08:55.680 --> 08:56.679
get your scores up.

09:00.022 --> 09:01.284
Sorry, that's where we are.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.726
Headmistress?

09:10.382 --> 09:12.595
Everyone's gone. You don't
have to be so formal anymore.

09:13.037 --> 09:14.230
Are you okay?

09:18.268 --> 09:20.268
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.907
I just need something to work in
my life right now, that's all.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.166
I'll do my best.

09:27.708 --> 09:29.145
That's all that's required.

09:36.086 --> 09:38.020
Can I get you some more coffee?

09:38.022 --> 09:39.589
No, I'm good. Thank you.

09:44.661 --> 09:48.364
I'm sorry I snapped before.

09:48.366 --> 09:50.377
No, no. It's all right.

09:51.269 --> 09:52.768
You're under a lot
of pressure right now.

09:59.843 --> 10:02.378
My wife and I, when Joshua was born,

10:02.700 --> 10:04.125
we disagreed.

10:04.816 --> 10:07.028
The doctor said if he lived,

10:07.619 --> 10:09.821
he was gonna have major problems.

10:10.887 --> 10:12.821
I was of the opinion

10:12.824 --> 10:16.602
that we should spare him
that life of pain.

10:19.029 --> 10:20.881
But my wife...

10:22.433 --> 10:27.496
we'd tried a few times before... failed.

10:28.718 --> 10:30.385
There was no way
she was giving up that baby.

10:32.309 --> 10:35.661
After the first surgery,
though, he almost died.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.381
There was a moment then

10:38.383 --> 10:39.901
that she might have let him go.

10:41.381 --> 10:42.952
But then the church got involved.

10:42.954 --> 10:44.510
She called Bishop.

10:44.689 --> 10:46.312
He came to the hospital.

10:47.091 --> 10:50.541
That's when she took that
picture she was talking about.

10:51.496 --> 10:55.900
He said the Lord
had big plans for Joshua.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.468
He was gonna be used by God.

11:01.705 --> 11:03.459
There's been one year

11:04.142 --> 11:07.795
that boy hasn't
been in here for something,

11:08.713 --> 11:13.027
stuck, poked, choked, cut open.

11:13.866 --> 11:15.651
You can't imagine what it's like

11:15.653 --> 11:18.821
to see someone suffer like that

11:18.823 --> 11:21.832
and you know you can't
do a thing about it.

11:25.629 --> 11:27.296
No, I'm sure I can't.

11:30.601 --> 11:31.767
How is he?

11:31.769 --> 11:33.302
The surgeon says they got it all.

11:33.604 --> 11:34.704
Now we'll just have to pray

11:34.706 --> 11:35.838
it doesn't happen again.

11:36.465 --> 11:37.572
Right?

11:37.575 --> 11:39.397
Come on. I want to see my son.

11:42.112 --> 11:43.379
Thanks for coming.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.618
Connie.

12:05.435 --> 12:06.707
Mae.

12:11.675 --> 12:13.659
You believe this rain?

12:14.078 --> 12:15.611
Bishop sent you, didn't he?

12:16.321 --> 12:18.113
Now, Connie, you know

12:18.116 --> 12:19.891
James don't send me anywhere.

12:20.885 --> 12:22.852
I just been sick about
all this since you left.

12:22.854 --> 12:25.254
- So, he doesn't know you're here.
- No.

12:25.256 --> 12:26.989
Well, that's a disappointment.

12:26.991 --> 12:28.591
- Connie.
- I never expected him

12:28.593 --> 12:30.459
to come crawling in person, of course,

12:30.461 --> 12:32.962
but at least I thought he'd call.

12:32.964 --> 12:35.464
Well, he's been meaning to,
but he's been so busy,

12:35.466 --> 12:38.934
especially with you
and your partisans absent.

12:38.936 --> 12:40.970
He should have thought of that before...

12:41.338 --> 12:42.837
well, it's over.

12:46.143 --> 12:49.930
Connie, come back to the church,

12:50.515 --> 12:51.614
rejoin the board,

12:51.616 --> 12:54.940
and we will iron this all out.

12:58.373 --> 13:00.356
Matthew 18:15.

13:00.358 --> 13:02.787
Don't go quoting scripture at me, Mae.

13:03.294 --> 13:04.527
I told him it's his fault.

13:04.529 --> 13:06.060
But not in private.

13:06.531 --> 13:09.365
You called him out in front
of the whole deacon board.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.308
You must have known
that wouldn't go well.

13:11.310 --> 13:12.454
I was making a point.

13:12.456 --> 13:16.372
Now it's made. Please.

13:16.374 --> 13:19.053
Why do you want me back anyway?

13:20.978 --> 13:22.344
Connie, you were there.

13:23.087 --> 13:24.714
You know what it took

13:24.716 --> 13:26.115
to go from that little storefront church

13:26.117 --> 13:27.616
to what we have today.

13:28.086 --> 13:30.318
And now everywhere I look,

13:30.632 --> 13:33.022
everything is topsy-turvy.

13:33.639 --> 13:36.935
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

13:36.938 --> 13:38.691
I'm not sure it's going to be.

13:39.297 --> 13:41.330
I mean, ever since she got home...

13:41.332 --> 13:42.498
well, you don't know,

13:42.500 --> 13:45.167
but it has been plague after plague,

13:45.169 --> 13:47.203
arguments, controversy.

13:47.205 --> 13:49.472
I feel like Pharaoh.

13:49.474 --> 13:50.906
Children are hard, I'm told.

13:50.908 --> 13:53.157
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

13:54.479 --> 13:55.511
You know...

13:57.748 --> 13:59.548
she was the one who pressured James

13:59.550 --> 14:02.092
to contact that officer
in the first place.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.786
Yes.

14:04.149 --> 14:05.465
He didn't want to do it.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.690
But he is powerless
when it comes to that child.

14:07.692 --> 14:08.891
I mean, it's terrible.

14:08.893 --> 14:11.239
Well, she is a prophet, isn't she?

14:13.414 --> 14:14.158
Pardon me?

14:14.160 --> 14:16.887
I remember hearing Grace preach.

14:17.335 --> 14:19.668
She's got that prophetic gift.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.904
The bishop does well to heed her.

14:21.906 --> 14:25.141
I thought that you didn't want
the police in the church.

14:25.143 --> 14:27.109
- I thought...
- I didn't.

14:27.111 --> 14:30.164
But I can live with
a difference of opinion.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.915
It's how the bishop handled it
that I take issue with.

14:34.243 --> 14:36.117
He should have asked.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.487
I feel like everything's falling apart

14:38.489 --> 14:40.689
and I need boots on the ground,

14:40.691 --> 14:42.925
because I'll be damned
if I'm going to let everything

14:42.927 --> 14:45.795
I worked all these years for
slip through my fingers.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.844
Well, Mae, I'm sorry,

14:49.600 --> 14:51.367
but unless the bishop comes in person...

14:51.369 --> 14:53.202
He will never humble himself that way.

14:53.204 --> 14:54.537
You know that man.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.338
Then we'll just be friends.

14:57.119 --> 14:57.873
I'm fine with that.

15:00.355 --> 15:01.419
Huh.

15:17.562 --> 15:20.129
Call Fred Williams.

15:20.131 --> 15:21.764
Calling Fred Williams.

15:23.501 --> 15:25.167
They're still not high enough.

15:25.169 --> 15:27.536
- Proficient is passing.
- Barely.

15:27.538 --> 15:29.732
Is that how you want
to get through life?

15:30.491 --> 15:31.636
Like your daddy?

15:32.510 --> 15:35.365
Colleges look at these, Zora.

15:36.796 --> 15:39.515
You can smile that smile all you want,

15:39.517 --> 15:41.882
but if you don't have the scores...

15:43.028 --> 15:44.352
What's the matter?

15:44.355 --> 15:45.955
- Go get ready for dinner.
- What happened?

15:45.957 --> 15:47.289
We'll finish this later.

15:52.863 --> 15:58.627
Ahh. "Home is the sailor,
home from the sea,

15:58.629 --> 16:00.903
and the hunter home from the hill."

16:00.905 --> 16:03.172
- Hi, Daddy.
- Where were you all day?

16:03.174 --> 16:04.106
At the hospital.

16:04.475 --> 16:05.908
Sophia's all right, I hope.

16:05.910 --> 16:07.877
Sophia's fine.
I was just doing some work.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.912
Well, who's sick, then?

16:09.914 --> 16:11.547
Joshua Russell.

16:11.549 --> 16:13.549
Oh, yeah.

16:13.551 --> 16:15.150
That family, they've had it rough.

16:15.152 --> 16:17.353
Yeah, it sounds like it.

16:17.355 --> 16:18.787
He's going to be okay,

16:18.789 --> 16:20.155
but he has to be there
for a few more days.

16:20.157 --> 16:21.223
You might want to stop by.

16:21.225 --> 16:23.926
Oh. We'll both go tomorrow.

16:24.511 --> 16:26.262
We can do a little tag team ministry.

16:26.590 --> 16:27.830
I'd like that.

16:27.832 --> 16:29.532
Hmm.

16:29.534 --> 16:31.770
- Sure. Sure.
- Okay? Good.

16:32.103 --> 16:33.302
See you at dinner.

16:33.866 --> 16:36.538
Melisse? Melisse?

16:37.108 --> 16:39.909
I could smell that lemon curd
all the way upstairs.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.343
Let me get a piece
before Mae comes down here.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.445
And the loan officer turned her down,

16:44.448 --> 16:46.582
even after she'd provided
all that extra paperwork,

16:46.584 --> 16:47.917
gone through all that trouble.

16:47.919 --> 16:48.918
She was desolate.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.042
I said, "Louise,

16:51.722 --> 16:53.122
even when man says no,

16:53.441 --> 16:55.090
God can still say yes."

16:55.628 --> 16:56.858
That was a week ago.

16:57.289 --> 16:59.129
Got a call just this morning.

16:59.564 --> 17:00.829
The loan was approved.

17:00.831 --> 17:03.899
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:04.226 --> 17:07.579
Well, speaking of praise reports,

17:08.172 --> 17:09.204
Kevvie?

17:12.541 --> 17:14.669
Well, excuse me, everyone, but, uh...

17:15.512 --> 17:17.112
Charity and I would like
to make an announcement.

17:17.114 --> 17:20.015
- Today went well?
- Better than expected.

17:20.017 --> 17:21.353
What's going on here?

17:21.377 --> 17:23.270
I got a feeling I'm being
left out of something.

17:23.271 --> 17:25.354
Y'all know how I despise that feeling.

17:25.356 --> 17:28.089
Daddy, I already told Mama.

17:31.628 --> 17:34.375
Jacob is having an affair with Alexa.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.866
He promised today at therapy
that he would stop,

17:37.868 --> 17:40.987
but he obviously has no
real intention of doing so.

17:41.505 --> 17:43.906
What are you talking about?

17:43.908 --> 17:45.508
You texted the wrong person, Jacob.

17:45.843 --> 17:47.883
Anybody can read it.

17:47.885 --> 17:49.620
Kerissa, now is not the time...

17:49.645 --> 17:50.878
I'm sorry.

17:51.767 --> 17:55.223
I have tried prayer, therapy.

17:55.886 --> 17:59.198
I've tried trading a trip to Las Vegas

17:59.200 --> 18:01.601
for an ounce of respect.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.899
I don't know what else to do.

18:05.999 --> 18:08.744
I'm sorry. What was your news?

18:10.376 --> 18:11.969
We're having twins.

18:19.358 --> 18:21.358
How many are you listened to.

18:22.092 --> 18:24.552
20, 30. I don't know.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.847
Why didn't you tell me?

18:28.333 --> 18:29.599
I thought it would make you sad.

18:29.601 --> 18:31.701
Oh, honey.

18:31.703 --> 18:34.152
You were just starting to
seem like you liked it here.

18:34.706 --> 18:35.972
What does she talk about?

18:36.568 --> 18:38.907
Bible stories...

18:38.910 --> 18:40.296
and how to live.

18:41.577 --> 18:43.517
Why do you listen to it?

18:44.682 --> 18:48.066
It's interesting, and it helps.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.220
Doing what she talks about helps.

18:56.325 --> 18:58.420
See, this is why I didn't tell you.

18:59.464 --> 19:00.817
I didn't want to make you sad.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.995
You didn't make me sad, honey.

19:05.737 --> 19:08.358
It just is sad, that's all.

19:09.073 --> 19:10.139
Hmm.

19:14.745 --> 19:16.802
She talks about you in one.

19:18.216 --> 19:19.398
Bad or good?

19:19.984 --> 19:21.183
Why would she say bad things?

19:21.185 --> 19:22.918
What did she say about me?

19:23.778 --> 19:25.592
That you're stubborn...

19:27.557 --> 19:29.025
but there's a time for that.

19:31.395 --> 19:33.169
Which one did she say that in?

19:35.365 --> 19:37.239
You're so weird.

19:38.369 --> 19:40.016
"Bad or good?"

19:45.742 --> 19:47.401
I think it's this one.

19:48.713 --> 19:52.381
- Can I borrow it?
- Sure, but I want it back.

19:52.383 --> 19:53.969
Oh, I'll give it back.

19:54.752 --> 19:55.889
Deal.

20:02.292 --> 20:03.671
Are there any recordings of you

20:03.673 --> 20:04.886
when you used to preach?

20:05.351 --> 20:07.630
Not that I know of, thank God.

20:07.632 --> 20:09.899
I can't imagine you preaching.

20:09.901 --> 20:12.930
Neither can I... anymore.

20:13.905 --> 20:15.037
Do you miss it?

20:17.140 --> 20:18.157
No.

20:19.744 --> 20:20.570
Hmm.

20:21.979 --> 20:23.779
Hey, good night.

20:23.781 --> 20:24.814
Good night, sweet pea.

20:35.559 --> 20:37.623
Shut the door. Have a seat.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.799
Alexa's not in today?

20:45.722 --> 20:46.688
I fired her.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.337
How was the rest of your night?

20:51.142 --> 20:52.508
I know it had to be better than dinner.

20:57.948 --> 20:59.548
Pop, it was just a misunderstanding.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.916
I don't want to hear this.

21:00.918 --> 21:01.917
I was going to meet with Alexa, so...

21:01.919 --> 21:03.638
I don't want to hear it.

21:04.889 --> 21:05.955
You don't want to hear the truth.

21:05.957 --> 21:08.087
What do you know about the truth?

21:10.128 --> 21:13.763
Here it is, son. I love you.

21:14.030 --> 21:15.944
Nothing will ever change that,

21:17.502 --> 21:20.087
but you're not ready for leadership.

21:22.372 --> 21:23.372
What do you mean?

21:23.374 --> 21:24.573
I'm sitting you down.

21:28.278 --> 21:29.378
Mama know about this?

21:29.380 --> 21:30.946
We talked about it.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.551
So, how long am I being sat down for?

21:36.063 --> 21:37.520
90 days.

21:38.156 --> 21:40.364
Nine...

21:40.992 --> 21:43.826
Pop, who's going to preach
on third Sundays?

21:43.828 --> 21:45.661
I'll find somebody.

21:45.663 --> 21:46.929
Who's going to teach Bible study?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.708
Honestly?

21:49.901 --> 21:51.700
I feel like I can get
any good Christian boy

21:51.702 --> 21:53.335
from the local high school to do that.

21:53.861 --> 21:55.137
All you do is tell stories

21:55.139 --> 21:57.549
about your glory days on the gridiron.

21:58.309 --> 22:00.142
Who's going to teach discipleship?

22:00.144 --> 22:01.710
I mean, you know,
who's going to handle that?

22:01.712 --> 22:03.650
That's no longer your concern.

22:06.568 --> 22:07.668
Because Gigi's back.

22:09.753 --> 22:11.287
Excuse me?

22:11.289 --> 22:12.354
You wouldn't be sitting me down

22:12.356 --> 22:13.792
if Gigi wasn't back.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.178
Admit it.

22:23.832 --> 22:25.200
You're going to ask her
to take my place.

22:28.705 --> 22:29.916
Son.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.639
You have no place.

22:41.363 --> 22:42.756
That's just the devil.

22:43.421 --> 22:46.455
No, he's just finally getting
to spend time with his family.

22:46.457 --> 22:48.090
You know Jacob.

22:48.092 --> 22:51.053
His family's always his first priority.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.329
Agnes.

22:54.332 --> 22:58.100
The most handsome man has
just walked into my office.

22:58.536 --> 23:00.936
It... no, it's not Bishop.

23:01.248 --> 23:04.173
Oh, you know me.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.967
I kid, yes.

23:06.977 --> 23:08.043
All right, darling.

23:09.584 --> 23:10.584
Speak soon. Bye.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.985
Fred. Oh, Fred!

23:15.987 --> 23:19.455
I am so glad that you could
come on such short notice.

23:19.457 --> 23:22.191
One of the perks of retirement, right?

23:22.193 --> 23:23.559
Flexibility.

23:23.561 --> 23:26.528
I'm so looking forward to it.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.098
My work at church just keeps me so busy.

23:29.100 --> 23:33.135
I was on the phone about
pulpit flowers for an hour.

23:33.137 --> 23:34.737
So, what's going on?

23:34.739 --> 23:37.332
Nothing drastic.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.542
The bishop and I
just wanted to thank you

23:40.544 --> 23:42.578
for your willingness
to serve as chairman

23:42.580 --> 23:44.546
on the deacon board.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.116
It's just a blessing
that you're so ready to serve.

23:47.118 --> 23:48.951
Well, thank you.

23:48.953 --> 23:50.586
I'm excited about the prospect,

23:50.588 --> 23:53.355
although I must say that Misty and I,

23:53.357 --> 23:56.510
we're both sorry to see Deacon Sykes go.

23:57.425 --> 23:58.460
She's quite a character.

23:58.462 --> 24:00.560
Yes, she is, isn't she?

24:00.932 --> 24:03.732
But I daresay with a man
like you in charge,

24:03.734 --> 24:06.303
the board will be much more effective.

24:06.305 --> 24:08.433
- Let's hope so.
- Yes.

24:08.973 --> 24:10.539
Would you like some sugar?

24:10.541 --> 24:12.541
Oh, no, no. I'm cutting back.

24:12.866 --> 24:14.580
Well, I can't see why.

24:18.606 --> 24:20.641
Once we've bought this jet,

24:20.643 --> 24:22.776
you and Misty will have to join us

24:22.778 --> 24:24.778
on our next mission trip to Africa.

24:25.049 --> 24:26.121
Have you ever been?

24:27.281 --> 24:28.715
So, you're buying the jet?

24:29.092 --> 24:31.985
I believe so, yes.

24:32.233 --> 24:33.854
The bishop just picked one out.

24:33.856 --> 24:37.724
With this audit getting started
next week, we're buying a jet?

24:38.435 --> 24:39.726
Do you think we should wait?

24:45.433 --> 24:46.794
You're sure?

24:49.426 --> 24:50.817
Treat yourself.

24:51.674 --> 24:52.839
- Yes.
- Aww.

25:05.186 --> 25:06.716
You sure that's right?

25:07.189 --> 25:08.188
I don't know.

25:08.190 --> 25:09.523
Okay.

25:09.525 --> 25:10.625
Let's see.

25:10.627 --> 25:14.361
"Which bolded word
in the sentence is a noun?"

25:14.363 --> 25:16.964
- And a noun is what?
- A person, place, or thing.

25:16.966 --> 25:18.365
That's right.

25:18.367 --> 25:20.276
So, which bolded word?

25:20.636 --> 25:23.971
"Let's take my scooter
to the park tomorrow."

25:23.973 --> 25:28.252
Is the noun "take,"
"scooter," or "tomorrow"?

25:29.298 --> 25:30.405
Scooter?

25:32.780 --> 25:34.381
If that's what you think.

25:43.768 --> 25:45.523
Are you sure this is the right room?

25:46.206 --> 25:48.159
- Pastor Greenleaf?
- Yeah?

25:48.508 --> 25:49.627
- Yes?
- Where's Joshua?

25:49.629 --> 25:51.462
He's being prepped for surgery.

25:51.464 --> 25:52.997
Another one? What happened?

25:52.999 --> 25:54.865
Confidentially...

25:54.867 --> 25:56.549
- Where are his parents?
- In pre-op.

25:56.574 --> 25:59.059
If you'd be kind enough
to show us the way,

25:59.038 --> 26:00.805
I'd like to pray with the
family before he goes in.

26:00.807 --> 26:02.640
Of course. Come with me.

26:02.642 --> 26:04.108
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Listen.

26:04.110 --> 26:04.930
We have to hurry.

26:04.932 --> 26:06.410
Could we just... one second, please?

26:06.412 --> 26:07.749
Thank you.

26:08.995 --> 26:09.914
What? What's the matter?

26:10.382 --> 26:11.449
Don't go tell them

26:11.451 --> 26:13.284
everything's gonna be just fine, please?

26:13.605 --> 26:16.009
I've never told anyone anything
that absurd in my life.

26:16.011 --> 26:17.534
Okay, but...

26:18.191 --> 26:19.490
you're going to tell them

26:19.492 --> 26:21.457
that God has a plan for that boy,

26:22.028 --> 26:23.194
for the family,

26:23.196 --> 26:24.762
that his eye is on them.

26:24.764 --> 26:26.069
Which is true.

26:26.114 --> 26:27.543
Daddy, don't give them hope.

26:28.134 --> 26:29.366
Why?

26:29.368 --> 26:31.431
Because it hurts.

26:32.238 --> 26:33.637
Where is this coming from?

26:36.475 --> 26:38.142
The father told me yesterday...

26:38.528 --> 26:40.845
Gigi, that man has been beset
by a spirit of despair

26:40.847 --> 26:42.399
since the day he was born.

26:43.249 --> 26:45.881
- His name is Legion.
- Just listen to me...

26:46.452 --> 26:47.752
for once.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.584
Just pray that God's will is done.

26:54.153 --> 26:57.085
Don't pray for health.
Don't pray for safety.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.076
Just...

27:01.586 --> 27:03.643
Just for God's will, please.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.538
I can't promise you what I'll say.

27:11.310 --> 27:15.738
But I assure you, I will listen
for the spirit's say-so,

27:16.249 --> 27:19.049
as I always do before I utter a word.

27:31.415 --> 27:34.456
Bishop, thank goodness you're here.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.102
Ask God not to take my baby.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.128
Please.

27:41.592 --> 27:42.511
Okay.

27:55.239 --> 27:56.473
Take my hand, sister.

28:00.411 --> 28:01.757
Pastor.

28:12.456 --> 28:13.456
Let us pray.

28:27.771 --> 28:28.805
Lord God...

28:33.611 --> 28:34.811
he is Joshua.

29:02.573 --> 29:04.566
I just don't want him to hurt anymore.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.644
I want him to be happy.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.193
He's such a good boy.

29:10.007 --> 29:11.774
He shouldn't have to hurt this way.

29:19.068 --> 29:20.902
I just want to let him go.

29:24.428 --> 29:26.529
My baby.

29:30.801 --> 29:32.368
Let's leave these folk in peace.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.004
- What did you do?
- What do you mean?

30:08.006 --> 30:09.812
What did you do to achieve this?

30:10.725 --> 30:12.502
- Um...
- You know what?

30:13.244 --> 30:15.812
It doesn't matter. I don't care.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.868
Whatever you did,
just do it next Friday.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.383
Yeah.

30:22.486 --> 30:24.053
How's the wedding coming?

30:24.055 --> 30:25.989
We're in the home stretch.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.825
If you ever need any advice...

30:29.917 --> 30:31.415
Thanks. I'll let you know.

30:59.590 --> 31:00.623
Thank you.

31:01.378 --> 31:02.145
Don't thank me.

31:03.594 --> 31:04.627
I didn't do it for you.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.532
I asked God what to say

31:09.534 --> 31:11.129
and that's what he gave me.

31:11.770 --> 31:12.802
Mm-hmm.

31:16.373 --> 31:18.138
Ever since you came home,

31:19.010 --> 31:21.423
I've been looking for
that wide-eyed girl

31:22.213 --> 31:25.882
that carried the red King James Bible

31:26.179 --> 31:28.298
with the John 3:16 bookmark.

31:32.256 --> 31:36.472
Apparently, she's long gone.

31:44.201 --> 31:45.538
Daddy?

31:47.072 --> 31:48.163
Yes?

31:49.699 --> 31:51.575
Why didn't you listen to me?

31:52.250 --> 31:53.242
I just did exactly what you asked.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.477
No, I'm talking about

31:54.479 --> 31:56.666
when I told you what Faith said to me

31:57.248 --> 31:59.015
about Uncle Mac.

32:02.052 --> 32:03.086
I did.

32:06.523 --> 32:07.857
I went straight to Faith,

32:07.859 --> 32:09.331
your mother and I both,

32:09.928 --> 32:11.260
and she said she made
the whole thing up.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.229
You knew that that wasn't true.

32:13.231 --> 32:16.966
Gigi, if I thought
your Uncle Mac did anything

32:16.968 --> 32:19.192
like what you and Faith
were talking about...

32:21.772 --> 32:23.869
do you think he'd still be at Calvary?

32:25.093 --> 32:26.943
You think he'd still be alive?

32:31.582 --> 32:34.990
Your sister lied,
and we've all been living

32:34.992 --> 32:37.257
in the shadow of that lie
for twenty years,

32:37.655 --> 32:39.288
you most of all.

32:44.628 --> 32:46.927
I'll tell you what I am sorry about.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.499
I'm sorry we didn't listen to you

32:49.501 --> 32:51.234
about going to the police.

32:53.664 --> 32:54.831
That was my mistake.

32:57.472 --> 32:58.580
If we had,

32:59.677 --> 33:00.877
if we had gotten the whole thing out

33:00.879 --> 33:03.943
in the open just like you said,

33:05.516 --> 33:06.683
I've got a funny feeling

33:07.506 --> 33:09.275
that your sister
would have been happier,

33:10.088 --> 33:11.482
you wouldn't have quit preaching,

33:12.290 --> 33:14.595
and the church would be in a
much better position than it is,

33:15.227 --> 33:17.427
to say nothing of the family.

33:20.711 --> 33:21.985
I'm sorry about that.

33:27.891 --> 33:29.234
Listen, with...

33:32.470 --> 33:34.746
with Jacob sat down now, I'm...

33:36.721 --> 33:38.138
I'm up against it.

33:42.079 --> 33:43.579
If there's anything
you can do to help...

33:47.898 --> 33:49.098
Just think about it.

33:55.566 --> 33:56.700
Yeah, Daddy.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.168
I'll think about it.

33:59.469 --> 34:00.716
Thank you.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.684
Good morning, everybody.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.286
Good morning, Sister Greenleaf.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.222
Whoa, that was a big good morning.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.458
You guys almost blew me over.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.860
How are all my little saints
doing this morning?

34:57.862 --> 35:00.563
- Good.
- Good.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.099
Did anybody here ever lose
their favorite toy?

35:03.101 --> 35:06.636
- I have. I lost my stuffed zebra.
- I lost my doll.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.971
Losing something is sad, isn't it?

35:08.973 --> 35:12.256
But it's really bad when what
you lost was your favorite.

35:12.258 --> 35:15.211
I lost my favorite toy
when I was a little girl.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.246
You know what it was?

35:17.248 --> 35:20.183
- Was it a unicorn?
- A teddy bear!

35:20.185 --> 35:23.219
Yes, good job. You
guessed it, a teddy bear.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.054
It was a little stuffed Teddy Bear.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.723
And you know what his name was?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.891
- Uh, Brownie!
- Fluffy!

35:28.893 --> 35:30.893
Duckie. Isn't that silly?

35:32.022 --> 35:34.022
Whats the hell is this?

35:34.849 --> 35:35.843
Hmm?

35:36.852 --> 35:38.435
What's wrong now?

35:39.221 --> 35:42.115
Fred Williams has called an
emergency meeting of the deacons.

35:42.525 --> 35:43.852
Oh.

35:44.493 --> 35:46.252
So, he went ahead and did it.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.027
You know about this?

35:50.533 --> 35:51.667
Not really.

35:52.501 --> 35:54.701
I overheard Darlene talking,

35:54.703 --> 35:56.503
and apparently Fred thinks

35:56.505 --> 35:59.139
that we should hold off
on buying that jet.

35:59.141 --> 36:01.375
The board already approved this.

36:01.377 --> 36:02.655
He was there when they voted.

36:02.657 --> 36:05.913
Yes, but that was under Deacon Sykes.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.644
This is Deacon Williams.

36:09.111 --> 36:11.284
He's concerned about the audit.

36:12.888 --> 36:13.875
Hmph.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.390
What?

36:16.392 --> 36:19.060
You've been complaining about
that old jet for ten years.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.495
Now you're willing to risk
losing this new one

36:21.497 --> 36:22.996
just to get Connie back?

36:22.998 --> 36:24.567
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:24.569 --> 36:25.768
Oh, Mae.

36:28.636 --> 36:29.636
I'll say this, though.

36:31.873 --> 36:34.233
Now that that little whore is gone,

36:34.543 --> 36:36.713
I'll be taking back my office.

36:37.313 --> 36:40.281
The trains are going to
run on time over there.

36:41.881 --> 36:43.430
I feel for Kerissa,

36:43.432 --> 36:46.286
but honestly, it makes me want to quit.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.122
It's not why I got into teaching.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.057
It just sounds like she's
in a bad place right now.

36:50.059 --> 36:51.121
Give it time.

36:51.545 --> 36:54.595
I'm only working there
because you're working here.

36:55.018 --> 36:57.296
Look, I know we're
having the wedding here,

36:57.299 --> 36:58.765
and that'll be nice,

36:58.767 --> 37:00.134
but maybe after we get married,

37:00.136 --> 37:04.285
we could just go, you know?

37:04.740 --> 37:06.607
- Where?
- Somewhere where every move we make

37:06.609 --> 37:09.343
doesn't corral us into some
corner of this family.

37:10.243 --> 37:12.178
Don't you like that idea?

37:12.181 --> 37:14.448
I don't not like the idea. It's just...

37:14.450 --> 37:15.983
What, you want to stay here with Gigi?

37:15.985 --> 37:17.340
No!

37:17.786 --> 37:19.553
I just don't know what else I would do

37:19.555 --> 37:21.321
with my life right now.

37:21.323 --> 37:22.823
Noah, when we first met,

37:22.825 --> 37:24.925
you told me you wanted
to move to Colorado

37:24.927 --> 37:27.761
and be a ski guide or a mountain guide.

37:27.763 --> 37:29.796
- Yeah.
- So, what's changed?

37:30.443 --> 37:32.165
Let's do that. We can do that.

37:32.168 --> 37:33.649
I can teach anywhere.

37:36.738 --> 37:37.729
Okay.

37:38.776 --> 37:42.486
Okay, let's make a plan.

37:43.441 --> 37:45.811
Okay, I will.

37:45.814 --> 37:47.551
Sackcloth and ashes, Connie.

37:49.910 --> 37:51.077
Sackcloth and ashes.

37:53.288 --> 37:54.922
Pork chops and applesauce?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.358
Sackcloth and ashes, Connie.

37:57.793 --> 37:59.263
Sackcloth and ashes.

37:59.595 --> 38:04.351
Mishandled, mismanaged, and I'm sorry.

38:05.201 --> 38:07.367
A church goes into free fall

38:07.369 --> 38:09.169
when there are no checks and balances.

38:09.171 --> 38:10.804
I know. You told me.

38:10.806 --> 38:13.207
- It's biblical.
- I hear you.

38:14.099 --> 38:15.675
I love Calvary Fellowship.

38:15.678 --> 38:17.477
I know you do.

38:18.289 --> 38:20.913
I think you may be the only
other person at Calvary

38:20.916 --> 38:21.915
that loves it as much as I do.

38:23.082 --> 38:24.350
Maybe more.

38:24.850 --> 38:26.385
That's true. Maybe more.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.090
You might have something there.

38:29.158 --> 38:33.427
So, what do I have to do

38:33.429 --> 38:35.562
to get you back
running the deacon board?

38:36.059 --> 38:40.133
Well, for starters?

38:40.135 --> 38:42.869
Yes, let's assume there's a list.

38:43.443 --> 38:46.573
One of those gold-plated names
on the back of the pews

38:46.575 --> 38:48.308
like the Roundtable gets.

38:49.075 --> 38:50.410
Easy.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.346
"Connie Sykes. Deacon Connie Sykes.

38:52.348 --> 38:53.313
Sister Connie Sykes"?

38:53.315 --> 38:54.668
"Kenny Collins.

38:55.317 --> 38:58.785
1999-2016.

38:58.787 --> 39:00.420
Unforgotten."

39:07.629 --> 39:08.562
Done.

39:15.803 --> 39:16.970
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.091
Ooh, hey.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.380
How did you do on your prep test?

39:26.382 --> 39:28.115
- Advanced.
- Oh.

39:28.117 --> 39:29.616
And how did you manage that?

39:29.618 --> 39:33.377
- I cheated.
- Very funny.

39:34.323 --> 39:36.356
Okay, little man,

39:36.358 --> 39:39.559
you are done, all right?

39:39.561 --> 39:41.061
Can you get him ready for bed?

39:41.063 --> 39:42.596
- I'll be in in a minute.
- Mm-hmm.

39:42.598 --> 39:43.930
Come on, little man.

39:43.932 --> 39:45.299
Bath time.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.041
Are you ever going to talk to me?

40:08.523 --> 40:09.472
Yeah.

40:29.877 --> 40:30.877
You were right.

40:31.412 --> 40:32.746
About what?

40:33.579 --> 40:35.171
Gigi...

40:36.085 --> 40:38.719
Daddy, the whole thing.

40:41.989 --> 40:43.056
You were right.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.734
Hey there, Pastor. You got a minute?

40:53.736 --> 40:54.801
I do. I do. Come on in.

40:58.106 --> 41:00.173
Have you given any more
thought to my request

41:00.761 --> 41:02.240
about stepping up?

41:02.911 --> 41:05.114
- I have.
- And?

41:05.748 --> 41:08.081
- I can do it.
- Oh, praise God.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.764
I won't preach.

41:11.285 --> 41:12.941
We'll see about that.

41:13.122 --> 41:15.522
But I will do all
the administrative stuff,

41:15.524 --> 41:16.649
discipleship duties.

41:17.292 --> 41:19.559
- Meaning?
- Auxiliaries, clubs, small groups.

41:19.561 --> 41:22.596
- Wonderful.
- One thing, though, Daddy.

41:24.042 --> 41:25.531
The first thing I'm going to do

41:25.534 --> 41:27.834
is start a small group for
the victims of sexual abuse.

41:29.226 --> 41:30.404
Just so you know.

41:33.374 --> 41:34.408
Thanks for the warning.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.309
I'll leave you to it.

41:36.515 --> 41:37.510
Uh...

41:40.090 --> 41:41.234
What's this?

41:41.717 --> 41:43.150
I don't know.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.718
It's from the Russells.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.113
They left it for you.
