00:05.898 --> 00:09.026
Edgebono utoosis,

00:09.902 --> 00:12.234
Good. Thank you, Justin.

00:12.371 --> 00:15.636
That is how you execute
the duplication spell properly.

00:15.774 --> 00:18.140
Real rabbit. Duplicate rab-- No.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.037
Duplicate rabbit, real--

00:20.179 --> 00:22.943
lt's-- Anyway, there's two now.

00:23.415 --> 00:25.315
What's the big deal? They're rabbits.

00:25.451 --> 00:28.682
Wait five minutes
and they'll duplicate by themselves.

00:28.921 --> 00:30.650
Remember, as with any spell,

00:30.789 --> 00:33.280
if you don't concentrate,
it doesn't come out exactly right.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.158
Cool. l've always wanted a guard rabbit.

00:39.298 --> 00:41.095
You know, scare off the mailman.

00:42.468 --> 00:45.437
l was thinking about dogs
when l cast the spell.

00:46.105 --> 00:48.437
Now, are there any questions
about the spell?

00:53.379 --> 00:56.507
Anyone who doesn't look
like they're about to wreck their pants?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.882
- The Crazy Ten-Minute Sale!
- The crazy what?

01:00.319 --> 01:02.879
Every year this cool clothing store,
Suburban Outfitters,

01:03.021 --> 01:04.750
has this crazy sale for ten minutes

01:04.890 --> 01:07.358
where they practically give stuff away
and--

01:09.261 --> 01:11.286
- What are you doing?
- Fast-forwarding to the part

01:11.430 --> 01:13.898
where this sale is more important
than the magic lesson.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.091
- Well, Gigi's gonna be there.
- Who's Gigi?

01:16.235 --> 01:18.226
Don't you remember?
My enemy since kindergarten,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.861
when she spilled juice on my mat
during nap time

01:21.006 --> 01:22.735
and told everyone l had an accident.

01:23.175 --> 01:24.972
This is fascinating.

01:25.110 --> 01:26.441
Tell me more.

01:27.646 --> 01:30.513
Well, l'm sick of Gigi.
She's always rubbing stuff in my face.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.610
The point is, l'm tired of her
always showing me up at school.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.515
Can l please skip class on Thursday
to go to the sale?

01:37.656 --> 01:40.750
Let's roll the answer dice, shall we?

01:41.627 --> 01:43.117
No. Come on.

01:43.262 --> 01:45.389
- But, Dad--
- But nothing.

01:45.531 --> 01:48.056
Look, you have wizard training
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

01:48.200 --> 01:49.394
and you're not ditching.

01:49.768 --> 01:52.896
You're right, you're right. l'm sorry.
l'm gonna totally focus on the magic.

01:53.172 --> 01:54.730
l have a question about the spell.

01:55.107 --> 01:56.165
Thank you.

01:56.308 --> 01:58.833
How do l use it
to get cool clothes before Gigi?

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.104 --> 03:02.335
Are you as excited about
the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale as l am?

03:03.408 --> 03:05.342
l can't go.

03:05.711 --> 03:08.976
But l drew up a game plan so we
could get into the store before Gigi.

03:09.114 --> 03:12.675
l thought we agreed that we hate Gigi
so much we'd never say her name.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.285
But you just said ''Gigi.''

03:15.120 --> 03:17.554
Okay, from now on
we'll say her name backwards.

03:17.689 --> 03:20.157
But ''Gigi'' backwards is still ''Gigi.''

03:20.826 --> 03:24.660
That's right. We'll say ''Gigi''
but only we'll know it's backwards.

03:24.796 --> 03:26.423
lt'll be hilarious.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.557
l like it. Anyway, do you remember

03:29.701 --> 03:32.261
that one-of-a-kind jacket
in the window you've been wanting?

03:32.404 --> 03:33.871
lt's gonna be in the sale.

03:34.273 --> 03:36.070
lt all sounds good, but l can't go.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.574
lt's on Thursday.
l have a family commitment.

03:38.710 --> 03:39.870
Do you also have a commitment

03:40.012 --> 03:43.209
to letting Gigi run all over you
for the rest of your life?

03:44.783 --> 03:47.047
Great.
Here she comes with her copycat crew.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.618
Act like we don't care.

03:57.329 --> 03:58.523
Bonjour, Alex.

03:58.664 --> 04:00.222
Bonjour, Alex's friend.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.224
Nice shoes.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.929
l mean,
l don't care about you or your shoes.

04:07.272 --> 04:10.070
Yeah, l've had these shoes
for about a week.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.732
Oh, l mean, l'd give them to you,

04:11.877 --> 04:14.345
but l already promised them
to another charity.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.247
No, you should keep them.
They go so well with your eyebrow.

04:18.517 --> 04:20.279
Well, at least l don't have man hands.

04:20.418 --> 04:23.013
l mean, how do you get those meat stubs
through your sleeves?

04:23.855 --> 04:24.981
What happened to you two?

04:25.123 --> 04:27.284
Pick your noses so hard they fell off?

04:28.093 --> 04:29.458
They got nose jobs.

04:29.595 --> 04:33.122
When they heal,
they'll be just like Gigi's.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.534
When is Gigi's gonna heal?

04:37.769 --> 04:39.964
People always take shots
at the trendsetter.

04:40.105 --> 04:43.438
And by the way, l saw you looking
at that jacket at Suburban Outfitters.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.476
And good for you
for knowing you need a new one.

04:50.716 --> 04:53.310
But it's mine.
And it'll look so much better on me.

04:53.452 --> 04:54.783
Not if l get it first.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.650
Well, good luck finding it.
l already went down there and hid it.

04:57.789 --> 05:00.724
Hey, that's not in the spirit
of the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

05:00.859 --> 05:02.759
Yeah! Whatever.

05:03.395 --> 05:06.057
Come on, girls.
Time to change your gauze.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.930
Look! Alex had an accident again!

05:14.239 --> 05:15.365
Gigi, this is silly.

05:15.507 --> 05:16.838
How long is this gonna go on?

05:16.975 --> 05:18.840
We've been fighting with each other
forever.

05:18.977 --> 05:21.571
Fighting? Really? Let's see.

05:21.713 --> 05:24.273
l've won, like, 300 times
and you've won none.

05:24.416 --> 05:26.509
So it's not really a fight.

05:29.688 --> 05:31.656
She has won an awful lot.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.987
That's it. We're going to that sale
and l'm gonna show her up.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.617
But l thought you had a commitment.

05:36.862 --> 05:38.352
l'll work it out with my parents.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.321
Sure, they're pretty understanding.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.491
No, l'm just really sneaky.

05:49.574 --> 05:51.565
Honey? Honey?

05:51.710 --> 05:53.769
Listen.
So l need you to back me up on this.

05:53.912 --> 05:58.474
l told Alex she couldn't miss wizard class
to go to some crazy sale on Thursday.

05:58.617 --> 06:00.107
Okay. Wait.

06:00.252 --> 06:01.742
Do you mean
the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale?

06:01.887 --> 06:03.616
That's the one.

06:04.523 --> 06:07.287
Thank you for reminding me.
l almost forgot.

06:07.426 --> 06:09.485
lt doesn't sound
like you're gonna back me up.

06:09.895 --> 06:12.090
Don't worry, l am.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.289
Who's not allowed to go again?

06:15.067 --> 06:17.194
- Alex.
- Right.

06:17.803 --> 06:19.031
Wizard mail's here.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.800
Oh, wizards weekly, Let's see
if they printed my letter to the editor.

06:31.416 --> 06:35.443
l wish they'd take those out for people
who already have subscriptions.

06:37.456 --> 06:38.889
My wand didn't show up.

06:39.124 --> 06:41.115
That's bunk.

06:41.626 --> 06:44.493
l need my magic wand
so l don't have to learn spells anymore.

06:44.830 --> 06:47.731
Max, you're always gonna need
to know spells.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.029
Look, if l give you a bike,
that doesn't mean you know how to ride it.

06:51.169 --> 06:53.262
Awesome. l'm getting a bike?

06:53.839 --> 06:56.933
Look, l know how excited you are
about getting your first wand.

06:57.075 --> 07:01.603
So until it comes, how about using
old Black Licorice here?

07:03.081 --> 07:06.244
Yeah, that looks like something
you get out of a cereal box.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.086
Come on.
This is a 77 Wandwarp Featherlight.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.917
They don't even make these anymore.

07:12.290 --> 07:13.848
l can see why.

07:15.193 --> 07:18.594
Look, if you're not gonna take care of it,
then l'm not gonna give it to you.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.459
lt has tremendous sentimental value.

07:20.766 --> 07:23.735
This is the wand that helped me
get the goblins out of the basement

07:23.869 --> 07:25.166
when l was your age.

07:25.303 --> 07:29.399
And it's a tremendous back scratcher.
See?

07:29.641 --> 07:30.903
Cool.

07:31.710 --> 07:32.938
lt's a little dinged up, but--

07:33.078 --> 07:35.808
You can see where l filled it in
with black nail polish.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.572
There's a lot of great memories
wrapped up in this wand.

07:38.717 --> 07:40.912
And a lot of stories l'm tired of hearing.

07:43.789 --> 07:45.222
She said it, we didn't.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.357
- How do l look?
- Why?

07:54.499 --> 07:56.057
Because l'm going to duplicate myself.

07:56.201 --> 07:59.227
And if l look ugly,
l don't wanna look twice as ugly.

07:59.805 --> 08:01.705
What are you talking about?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.467
l'm talking about taking Gigi down,

08:03.608 --> 08:05.872
and it's gonna take more than one of me
to do it.

08:06.011 --> 08:08.741
Edgebono utoosis,

08:13.251 --> 08:15.048
Now that's cool.

08:15.187 --> 08:18.122
l wanna make two of me
so l can give myself a wedgie.

08:18.523 --> 08:19.888
Why would you wanna do that?

08:20.025 --> 08:24.485
Because l wanna see what it feels like,
but l wanna get it from someone l trust.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.258
Afternoon, Alex. Other Alex.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.262
You're both clearly up to no good.

08:31.570 --> 08:35.232
Max, just help me get me ready
so it looks like l'm here so l can leave.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.171
Wow, l did a great job.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.284
l look good.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.380
l was thinking
about your stupid barking rabbit.

08:51.523 --> 08:55.050
Yep, it's perfect, because that's
what l hear when you talk to me.

08:55.627 --> 08:58.687
Bad girl. No barking, just pout.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.298
Yeah, l don't see
how this could possibly go wrong.

09:02.868 --> 09:04.665
lt'll be fine.
The real me is upset with Dad,

09:04.803 --> 09:06.930
which means l pout
and give him the silent treatment.

09:07.072 --> 09:08.334
Yeah, but for how long?

09:08.607 --> 09:11.337
Well, this has to pout
for the Ten-Minute Sale plus travel time,

09:11.476 --> 09:14.673
which shouldn't be a problem,
because my pout record is, like, four days.

09:17.649 --> 09:19.446
- Hello?
- Alex, are you sneaking away or not?

09:20.785 --> 09:23.549
The doors are gonna open any minute
and Gigi's already in the front.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.053
How did she get up front?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.784
l don't know, but she's telling everybody
you shop in pre-teen.

09:27.926 --> 09:31.487
Which l said wasn't a slam, because a lot
of their stuff is really, really cute.

09:31.630 --> 09:34.121
Like my sunflower top
that goes with my rainbow socks.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.232
l'll be right there.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.097
Wait, you're not wearing that, are you?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.070
No.

09:43.074 --> 09:45.770
You really think Dad'll be fooled
with this thing sitting here

09:45.911 --> 09:49.870
with that glassy look in its eye,
totally disconnected during class?

09:50.181 --> 09:51.705
Wow, you're right. This could work.

09:52.984 --> 09:55.612
What if Dad asks you
to change seats or something?

09:55.921 --> 09:57.081
l don't know, cover for me.

09:57.322 --> 09:58.880
Why would l cover for you?

09:59.124 --> 10:01.092
Because l'll buy you
a brand new pair of sneakers.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.784
Sold.

10:02.928 --> 10:04.259
Good boy. l'm off to the sale.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.364
And Mom and Dad know nothing
about that, right?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.628
l'm a size 5.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.393
That's your price?
A new pair of sneakers?

10:13.038 --> 10:14.869
Apparently.

10:15.473 --> 10:16.940
But the joke's on her.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.475
l'm gonna get some new sneakers
for doing nothing.

10:19.611 --> 10:21.841
What are you gonna do
when she falls over?

10:21.980 --> 10:23.641
That will never happen.

10:26.484 --> 10:28.918
You're right. lt'll never happen.

10:33.825 --> 10:35.122
Hi, Harper.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.852
Hi, Alex's mom.

10:37.228 --> 10:39.025
Oh, my gosh, Alex's mom?

10:39.931 --> 10:41.831
l know it's weird
for a grownup to be here,

10:41.967 --> 10:44.902
but since Alex couldn't come,
l'm gonna get something for her.

10:45.837 --> 10:47.099
Well, this will be fun.

10:47.238 --> 10:50.071
lt's a chance for you and me
to spend some time together, you know?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.903
Chill.

11:04.856 --> 11:06.881
Excuse me. There you are.

11:07.025 --> 11:08.652
How did you find me
with all these people?

11:08.927 --> 11:12.158
l saw your rainbow socks
from down the block.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.491
Sorry l'm late.
lt took a while to ditch the family.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.461
Well, you didn't do a very good job.
Your mom's here.

11:17.602 --> 11:18.728
- What?
- Relax.

11:18.870 --> 11:21.134
l sent her down the block
to find some tappuccinos.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.302
There's no such thing
as a tappuccino.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.465
l know.

11:25.844 --> 11:27.277
Wow, l'm impressed.

11:27.412 --> 11:29.073
You're becoming more like me
every day.

11:30.115 --> 11:31.742
- Okay, move.
- Sorry.

11:31.883 --> 11:33.316
Excuse me. Sorry.

11:33.451 --> 11:36.079
Excuse me.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.915
Nice try, Gigi. But it looks like
l got in the front of the line too.

11:40.058 --> 11:43.255
Well, l know where the jacket is,
and you don't.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.595
What's that?
You're looking for a racket?

11:45.730 --> 11:49.222
Well, l'm looking for a jacket.
And l'm gonna get it before you do.

11:49.367 --> 11:52.530
l can't believe you brought your grandma.
She's not gonna help you get in first.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.729
She's not my grandma.
l found her at the park.

11:54.873 --> 11:56.807
She's here to block.

12:04.783 --> 12:07.650
Where is it? lt was right here.

12:07.786 --> 12:10.721
Excuse me. There was a huge pile
of clothes right there.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.652
Where is it?

12:13.058 --> 12:16.357
Oh, we completely rearranged the store
for the sale,

12:16.494 --> 12:19.520
because a lot of people
sneak in early and hide stuff.

12:19.664 --> 12:23.225
lt's not really in the spirit
of the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.301
lt's anybody's jacket now.

12:28.406 --> 12:29.964
Harper.

12:30.108 --> 12:32.975
Harper? l found our tappuccinos.

12:33.111 --> 12:36.706
lt's steamed milk and tap water.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.019
She's too heavy.
Can you give me a hand?

12:42.320 --> 12:43.947
Why don't you use Dad's wand
to move her?

12:44.089 --> 12:46.284
l can't find it.

12:48.126 --> 12:52.256
Either l just found Dad's wand
or l cracked my butt knuckle.

12:52.497 --> 12:57.059
l'm no doctor, but l'm fairly certain
there's no such thing as a butt knuckle.

12:57.502 --> 13:00.835
No. No, no, no. Dad's gonna wig out.

13:00.972 --> 13:03.941
You know, if l wasn't getting
new sneakers, l'd be really freaked out.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.475
Oh, l'd be really freaked out anyway.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.374
Justin, will you at least help
prop her up?

13:08.513 --> 13:11.346
Sure, because she's done
so much for me.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.061
What are you doing?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.596
Dancing.

13:32.737 --> 13:33.795
With my sister.

13:34.305 --> 13:38.639
Practicing for that new reality show,
Dancing with my Sister,

13:40.478 --> 13:43.311
Okay, guys, before we get started today,

13:43.448 --> 13:47.179
l just wanna point out
the good example set by your sister.

13:47.318 --> 13:48.649
She really wanted to go shopping,

13:48.786 --> 13:51.152
but instead she's right here,
ready to learn.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.747
l think we're all gonna learn something
real soon.

13:55.026 --> 13:57.153
Alex, l'm very proud of you.

13:57.529 --> 14:00.362
So proud that l'm gonna
give you permission

14:00.498 --> 14:02.728
to miss today's lesson
and go to that sale.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.732
So go ahead and have fun.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.703
Seriously. Go.

14:10.508 --> 14:13.568
Oh, l get it. You need money.

14:13.711 --> 14:16.145
l'm sorry. Go ahead, take it. Take it.

14:16.281 --> 14:18.875
Yeah, Alex. Take it.

14:27.625 --> 14:30.958
Alex used the duplication spell
and went to the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

14:31.095 --> 14:32.926
Wow, looks like she did.

14:33.064 --> 14:35.430
This is way worse
than me breaking your wand, right?

14:35.567 --> 14:37.000
You--?

14:38.469 --> 14:41.336
Alex, wand. Alex, wand.

14:41.472 --> 14:43.269
Alex!

14:45.043 --> 14:48.103
Wow, he didn't even care
about the wand.

14:48.246 --> 14:51.113
That would've been a good time to tell him
l broke his new drill.

14:51.249 --> 14:52.443
You broke his drill?

14:52.584 --> 14:55.417
l think so. l'll find out
when l put the pieces back together.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.447
Check it out. My new eWand.

15:00.592 --> 15:02.822
Oh, an eWand. The strap is for safety.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.718
Good point.

15:06.798 --> 15:09.733
Now that we've got safety out of the way,
let's rock.

15:14.305 --> 15:16.102
Slippery.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.075
Wow, they should make something
that attaches to the wand

15:20.211 --> 15:21.735
so that doesn't happen.

15:28.453 --> 15:30.944
Alex, hide.
Your mom's right behind me.

15:31.089 --> 15:32.716
What?

15:33.992 --> 15:35.391
Harper, there you are.

15:35.526 --> 15:39.257
l found our tappuccinos.
They're surprisingly delicious.

15:44.702 --> 15:47.466
l'm sorry. Let's go tell a manager.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.630
Eight minutes left
in the Crazy Ten-Minute Sale.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.833
Eight minutes.

15:51.976 --> 15:53.375
Are you kidding me?

15:53.511 --> 15:55.945
l've only got eight minutes
to find something for Alex.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.342
What do you think she'd like?

15:57.482 --> 15:58.744
For you to leave.

15:58.883 --> 16:00.441
What?

16:00.618 --> 16:01.846
This is your size.

16:01.986 --> 16:03.886
Go try it on.

16:05.390 --> 16:06.789
Alex, are you okay?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.721
l'm fine, l'm fine. Did my mom see me?

16:08.860 --> 16:11.727
No, l sent her to the dressing room.
This is our chance. Let's get out.

16:11.863 --> 16:14.263
Oh, no, no, no.
l am not leaving without that jacket.

16:14.399 --> 16:17.163
l have choked on too many blouses
to let Gigi get that jacket.

16:17.302 --> 16:18.564
Harper.

16:18.703 --> 16:20.466
l'm going back in.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.734
Hey, what else does this thing do?

16:26.878 --> 16:28.038
Standard magic stuff.

16:28.179 --> 16:33.640
lt opens portals, disappears objects,
levitates things, and-- Oh, my gosh.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.811
- What?
- lt's an MP3 player.

16:38.489 --> 16:39.888
lt holds a trillion songs.

16:40.024 --> 16:41.184
No way.

16:41.326 --> 16:43.794
Oh, and it says here
it has eMimic feature.

16:43.928 --> 16:45.555
What's that?

16:47.732 --> 16:49.529
l think l just found out.

16:51.703 --> 16:53.933
Hey, Alex, why are you hitting yourself?

16:54.072 --> 16:56.870
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

16:59.277 --> 17:00.642
Why are you hitting yourself?

17:01.079 --> 17:03.013
l don't know.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.082
Oh, l know what you're doing.

17:06.217 --> 17:07.775
We must be getting close to the jacket.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.443
You're trying to distract me.

17:09.587 --> 17:12.818
Are you hitting yourself?
You've got problems.

17:13.191 --> 17:16.819
- Good burn.
- l know, l thought it and then l said it.

17:18.796 --> 17:20.286
Well, what are you doing now?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.266
What does it look like l'm doing?
l'm dancing like a chicken.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.333
l don't even know
why l try to embarrass you.

17:27.472 --> 17:29.406
l mean, you're so good at it yourself.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.601
l don't know what's happening.

17:35.046 --> 17:38.743
l do. You're dancing like an Egyptian.

17:40.385 --> 17:43.946
Hey, everyone,
there's a freak show by the jeans rack.

17:44.389 --> 17:46.152
Hey, Alex, l think we caught a break.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.656
There's some freak show by the jeans.
Let's go look.

17:48.993 --> 17:53.896
Harper, those are the jeans.
l'm the freak show.

17:56.801 --> 17:58.701
Faster. Faster. Let's see if it'll throw up.

18:06.310 --> 18:09.279
- Size 7. Perfect. Thanks, Alex.
- Help me!

18:09.614 --> 18:11.138
Theresa. Where's Alex?

18:11.282 --> 18:12.681
Jerry, she's with you.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.843
No, she's not. She cut class.
l came down here to look for her.

18:15.987 --> 18:17.420
Well, l haven't seen her.

18:22.293 --> 18:24.227
l think l just did.

18:24.896 --> 18:28.889
Alex, stop spinning wildly out of control
and get over here.

18:29.033 --> 18:30.933
l can't!

18:31.669 --> 18:33.466
What do you think's going on?

18:33.604 --> 18:35.834
l think Max got his new wand.

18:36.808 --> 18:38.207
l found it. l found the jacket.

18:38.476 --> 18:41.206
Hey, Gigi,
guess what's in my meat hands.

18:41.512 --> 18:43.639
- Give me the jacket. Give it to me. Give--
- No.

18:50.121 --> 18:53.750
Well, it looks like the tinklee
became the tinkler.

18:54.392 --> 18:57.122
Oh, please.
Everybody saw her spill that on me.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.354
Yeah, but it's on your front.

18:59.497 --> 19:01.488
lt does look like you went.

19:01.632 --> 19:04.226
But what are you two talking about?
l mean, you just saw that.

19:07.839 --> 19:09.067
Where are you going?

19:09.373 --> 19:12.035
We have the same noses.

19:12.176 --> 19:14.644
They're gone, Gigi. They left you.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.303
Okay, maybe you're right.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.210
This has been going on for too long.

19:18.516 --> 19:20.541
No, it hasn't. l'm just getting good at it.

19:20.685 --> 19:24.314
ln fact, l think it's time
for a little announcement.

19:26.591 --> 19:29.059
Okay, l know l'm in trouble.
But just, like, one second.

19:29.193 --> 19:31.184
Attention, shoppers.
Attention, shoppers.

19:31.329 --> 19:33.320
Gigi's real name is Gertude.

19:33.865 --> 19:35.924
Okay, now l can go.

19:37.768 --> 19:41.704
These sales get crazier and crazier
every year.

19:46.511 --> 19:48.502
Oh, Alex. Dad's looking for you.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.479
And he found you.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.406
Did you get your wand today, Max?

19:54.285 --> 19:56.150
Yeah.

19:56.787 --> 19:58.778
Because whatever you were doing
to this dummy

19:58.923 --> 20:01.448
was happening to this dummy.

20:02.193 --> 20:03.922
Oh, that's what the ''mimic''
in eMimic means.

20:04.061 --> 20:06.757
l told you
we should've read the manual.

20:07.031 --> 20:10.125
Max, you know better than to use magic
without my permission.

20:10.268 --> 20:12.736
You're right, Dad. You're right.
lt was pretty bad what l did.

20:12.870 --> 20:17.330
But not as bad as Alex using magic
to cut class to go to some sale.

20:17.475 --> 20:18.703
Yes, Max. Thank you.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.940
And you and l by no means
are done talking about this.

20:22.079 --> 20:25.378
l know. But before we get into it,
l think you should know,

20:25.516 --> 20:26.949
l heard Justin broke your drill.

20:27.885 --> 20:29.477
My brand new drill?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.950
Max broke your wand.

20:32.323 --> 20:35.292
- Did you use magic to break my drill?
- No.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.285
You're clear. Go.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.928
Did you use magic to break my wand?

20:41.065 --> 20:42.930
No, l sat on it.

20:43.167 --> 20:45.260
You're clear. Go.

20:46.971 --> 20:48.996
And we have a winner.

20:49.674 --> 20:52.268
Dad, l know you're mad,
but l can explain.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.571
Gigi has been making me look bad
forever,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.647
and this was a huge chance
to get back at her. So l went for it.

20:58.649 --> 20:59.946
Revenge.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.949
- So you do get it?
- l get it.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.747
But let's look at it, shall we?

21:04.121 --> 21:06.851
Was revenge worth missing
your wizard training?

21:06.991 --> 21:09.687
Was it worth having your brother
lie for you,

21:09.827 --> 21:12.455
or your best friend lie to your mom
down at that store?

21:12.597 --> 21:13.723
And speaking of your mother,

21:13.864 --> 21:17.300
she's got me trying
to make her a tappuccino?

21:18.369 --> 21:20.837
So what you're saying is,
by getting back at Gigi,

21:20.972 --> 21:22.633
l was really hurting myself?

21:23.207 --> 21:25.437
No, but l like that better.

21:25.676 --> 21:29.134
So since l figured that out,
l should pick my own punishment, right?

21:30.414 --> 21:34.874
No. Why don't you take my punishment
and duplicate it?

21:35.219 --> 21:38.154
- You're grounded for one week.
- Does that mean two weeks?

21:38.289 --> 21:40.723
Oh, now it's four. l love this game.

21:41.225 --> 21:43.216
Good talk, sweetie.

21:45.029 --> 21:47.088
Oh, you hush up.

21:49.900 --> 21:53.028
- So l'm glad you learned your lesson.
- Me too.

21:53.170 --> 21:55.866
Good. Now, your mom wants me
to take her out dancing,

21:56.007 --> 21:57.668
but the big game is on tonight.

21:57.808 --> 22:00.743
Dad, that sounds like your punishment,
not mine.

22:00.878 --> 22:02.641
Then you see what l'm getting at.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.243
Oh, you want me to duplicate you

22:06.384 --> 22:09.410
so you can go dancing
and watch the game.

22:10.021 --> 22:11.886
A little.

22:13.257 --> 22:17.956
Oh, well, if you have to punish me,
l guess you have to punish me.

22:18.095 --> 22:20.859
Edgebono utoosis,

22:22.667 --> 22:25.192
Have her home by 1 1 .
