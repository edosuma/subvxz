We're gonna need

-I did no such thing.
-I did.

00:25.842 --> 00:26.859
You didn't just break protocol.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.418
You broke every rule

We are gonna go get

00:50.125 --> 00:53.610
Marion, I just want

11:55.698 --> 11:57.549
I-I need her.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.109
-I'm beginning to freak out.
-TREVOR: O-Okay.

12:00.203 --> 12:01.444
Okay. Okay, um,

12:01.555 --> 12:04.038
I might be able to clear
the dog through social work.

12:04.207 --> 12:07.183
-I'll call Winston.
-(sighs)

12:09.730 --> 12:11.454
<i> McDONNELL:</i>
<i> Three, two,</i>

12:11.547 --> 12:13.398
one, mark.

12:20.815 --> 12:22.223
Two patients. That's the limit.

12:22.317 --> 12:24.993
We'll hitch a ride
on an ambulance.

12:29.991 --> 12:32.083
You okay? You got pretty cut up.

12:32.235 --> 12:35.545
-Let me take a look.
-I'm fine.

12:38.666 --> 12:39.999
That needs to be cleaned up.

12:40.151 --> 12:42.919
Might need a stitch or two.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.822
Are you two headed back
to Chastain?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.516
I got space
in the back of my rig.

12:54.090 --> 12:55.774
Thank you for getting me
off that bus.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.609
I almost went up in flames.

12:57.836 --> 12:59.235
I was worried about the cat.

13:00.688 --> 13:03.356
That you didn't know existed.

13:03.508 --> 13:04.966
Good point.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.010
Truth is,
I'm more of a dog person.

13:07.028 --> 13:09.454
(laughs) I'm a chicken guy.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.122
-No way.
-Oh, yeah.

13:11.349 --> 13:13.208
I'll have to hit you up
for some eggs.

13:28.624 --> 13:30.124
Oh, man.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.718
Is that little fluff nugget here
to comfort stressed out doctors?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.145
Because I am in need.

13:34.297 --> 13:37.315
That little fluff nugget
is an infection risk.

13:37.392 --> 13:39.375
Service dogs are allowed
in hospitals, Nurse Hundley.

13:39.394 --> 13:42.153
Some areas are off-limits,
but this isn't one.

13:42.305 --> 13:44.113
Hmm.

13:46.976 --> 13:49.160
-BooBooBear.
-DEVON: Hey, hold on.

13:49.387 --> 13:52.330
Lyme disease is on
the differential.

13:52.557 --> 13:54.907
Uh, Boo has no parasites, ever.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.392
She's groomed,

13:56.485 --> 13:57.836
gets a monthly topical
tick repellant, and her paws

13:57.987 --> 13:59.003
barely touch the ground. See?

13:59.230 --> 14:01.822
I-I carry her in this pup pack.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.384
We'll run a Lyme test anyway.

14:10.258 --> 14:12.241
Preliminary history
is unremarkable.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.018
No contact with anyone else
who was sick.

14:14.245 --> 14:17.080
No recent travel
or relevant medical issues.

14:17.098 --> 14:20.358
Jerome is a computer programmer

14:20.585 --> 14:23.010
who works from home.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.438
-Okay. What next?
-You build the differential

14:25.532 --> 14:28.641
using the latest test results,
but be patient.

14:28.793 --> 14:30.034
Fever of unknown origin

14:30.261 --> 14:33.204
can stump the most
experienced doctors.

14:47.536 --> 14:50.113
-What do we got?
-Two adult females.

14:50.206 --> 14:52.298
Young 20s. Traumatic
penetrating abdominal injury,

14:52.375 --> 14:54.634
evisceration.
Intubated at the scene.

14:54.786 --> 14:56.060
And the other one?

14:56.212 --> 14:57.729
Posterior elbow dislocation
with vascular compromise.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.805
Dr. Hawkins
reduced in the field.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.307
She's C.S. 13.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.975
Repetitive questioning,
possible head injury.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.570
Is Mindy going to be okay?

15:05.797 --> 15:06.905
Easy. We'll take care of her.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.407
We need to page
Sutton and Voss now.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.569
(softly):
Okay...

15:22.589 --> 15:24.213
Hey.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.075
Good work.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.410
I only have a few minutes.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.763
We have traumas
from the crash site coming in.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.580
What can we rule out?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.267
Jerome took an HIV test a week
ago. That came back negative.

15:36.419 --> 15:38.728
Plus, he has an elevated
white blood count.

15:40.014 --> 15:41.255
So?

15:41.499 --> 15:42.923
That means we cross off
all AIDS-defining illnesses,

15:42.943 --> 15:46.194
fungal infections like, uh, PJP.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.450
What else?

15:52.677 --> 15:55.078
Lupus, R.A., probably out.

15:56.698 --> 15:58.848
(sighs)

15:58.941 --> 16:00.774
I mean, the list
is brutally long.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.867
He could have almost anything.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.945
-Go talk to him again.
-Okay.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.297
-About what?
-Anything.

16:06.449 --> 16:08.949
What did he have for breakfast
two days ago?

16:09.043 --> 16:10.376
Do his parents
have heart trouble?

16:10.528 --> 16:11.694
Does he kiss his pet salamander?

16:11.787 --> 16:13.212
Wait. (chuckles)

16:13.364 --> 16:14.363
What does a salamander
have to do with it?

16:14.382 --> 16:15.881
Well, salamanders
carry salmonella,

16:16.034 --> 16:17.624
specifically osteomyelitis,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.126
which can cause a fever.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.646
My point is,
the answer is almost always

16:21.873 --> 16:24.223
in the patient history.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.526
I'll tag in when I can.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.532
(siren wailing)

16:34.995 --> 16:36.643
You aren't on the Go Team.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.164
Where'd the chopper pick you up?
Atlanta General?

16:40.316 --> 16:41.982
Yeah.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.836
They're not level-1 trauma.

16:45.063 --> 16:47.296
Where'd you learn
your field medicine?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.658
A lot of places.

16:51.753 --> 16:53.294
How about you?

16:53.404 --> 16:57.757
Afghanistan.
Yeah, Navy corpsman. Two tours.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.000
Back to you.

17:00.094 --> 17:02.928
Are you an ER doc?

17:03.081 --> 17:04.338
Trauma surgeon?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.083
I'm double board certified.
Emergency med and...

17:07.176 --> 17:08.693
EMT:
We're picking up
a patient en route.

17:08.844 --> 17:09.843
Female, 35,

17:09.863 --> 17:12.030
pregnant and in active labor.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.681
(chuckles)

17:14.776 --> 17:16.092
Who doesn't love babies?

17:16.185 --> 17:19.328
Looks like we're in
for more fun.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.541
We're stacked up
and more are incoming.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.601
Medivac just landed.

17:25.620 --> 17:27.770
We need a bay.
Severe abdominal lac.

17:27.789 --> 17:29.939
She needs to be top of the list.

17:29.957 --> 17:32.967
I saved you a trauma bay.
Follow me.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.223
Looks like Conrad
repacked the bowel on-site.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.117
-Team did a good job.
-Free fluid in the abdomen.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.044
Her intestines may have been
lacerated by the impalement.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.712
(groans)

17:45.807 --> 17:48.382
Mindy.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.975
Mindy. My name

17:50.128 --> 17:51.961
is Dr. Devi.
You've been in an accident,

17:51.963 --> 17:52.978
but we're gonna
take care of you, okay?

17:53.131 --> 17:54.480
AUSTIN:
Hundley, start her

17:54.574 --> 17:57.241
on her propofol drip.
I'll get someone to book an OR.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.496
BELL:
Gonna get you down to X-ray.

18:03.491 --> 18:04.657
Ortho and neuro page?

18:04.809 --> 18:06.809
Uh, Bay Two. Jill Rhinehart.
Dislocated elbow

18:06.828 --> 18:07.993
and an epidural hematoma.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.312
I thought you could use
an extra hand.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.338
Nolan.

18:14.502 --> 18:16.652
Hi, Jill. I'm Dr. Voss.

18:16.671 --> 18:18.221
And I'm Dr. Sutton.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.081
I'm just gonna do a quick exam.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.658
KIT:
How's the arm feel?

18:22.827 --> 18:25.085
It hurts bad, really bad.

18:25.179 --> 18:26.996
We'll get you something
for the pain.

18:27.014 --> 18:29.190
Let's get her 25 mikes
of fentanyl.

18:31.669 --> 18:33.528
Can you follow my finger?

18:36.932 --> 18:38.783
She needs an OR.

18:38.934 --> 18:41.193
I'll join you.
Compartment syndrome.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.621
We'll likely need to take that
down with a fasciotomy.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.623
-I'll prep her.
-Thanks.

18:45.774 --> 18:50.277
Jill, I'm gonna need
your consent for surgery.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.130
(crying)

18:52.281 --> 18:55.967
You're in good hands
with Dr. Nolan.

18:56.118 --> 18:58.386
-What a mess.
-And more coming.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.932
-Who are you operating on?
-I'm not.

19:03.868 --> 19:05.292
It's-it's better if I stay here.

19:05.370 --> 19:07.061
If they need a trauma surgeon,
they'll page me.

19:07.872 --> 19:08.980
All right.

19:09.131 --> 19:11.524
-I'll see you in a bit.
-Mm-hmm.

19:14.061 --> 19:18.990
(Bell speaking quietly)

19:24.497 --> 19:26.055
Ten times out of ten,

19:26.166 --> 19:27.648
a person with injuries like this
dies in the field.

19:27.725 --> 19:29.000
Genius work by the Go Team.

19:29.151 --> 19:30.001
Well, she has gross
contamination of her abdomen,

19:30.152 --> 19:31.394
and she's in septic shock.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.004
Okay, so we get in and out fast.
What's first?

19:33.155 --> 19:34.988
Identify the ligament of Treitz,
run the bowel,

19:35.082 --> 19:36.174
look for vascular injuries,

19:36.325 --> 19:37.566
and cut out anything
that's not viable.

19:37.585 --> 19:39.402
Very good.
We cannot miss anything.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.237
-If we leave contaminants...
-She dies.

19:41.330 --> 19:44.265
So, we're fast,
but we're meticulous.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.927
We need to avoid
ICP elevating meds

19:48.021 --> 19:50.671
and prep her for a right-sided
decompressive craniotomy.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.748
The arm looks terrible.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.675
Life and limb, literally.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.069
(siren wailing)

20:03.703 --> 20:05.778
-(groaning)
-Thank you.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.496
Thank you.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.692
Ma'am, how far apart
are your contractions?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.753
(speaking Creole)

20:16.607 --> 20:17.757
(speaking Creole)

20:22.964 --> 20:28.184
(both continue in Creole)

20:29.896 --> 20:32.396
Creole. She's Haitian.

20:32.623 --> 20:34.807
Guess I know where you learned
your field medicine.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.125
(groans)

20:36.143 --> 20:37.810
It's her third child.

20:37.886 --> 20:40.529
Which means it can come
very quickly.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.469
(groaning)

20:46.562 --> 20:47.912
Uh, no exotic foods?

20:48.139 --> 20:50.897
Raw fish? Wild mushrooms?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.583
JEROME:
I have a...

20:52.810 --> 20:54.810
a delicate stomach.

20:54.829 --> 20:57.713
Okay. Um...

20:59.166 --> 21:01.500
Any sexual encounters recently?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.761
I need my dog

21:03.988 --> 21:05.504
just to leave the apartment.

21:05.656 --> 21:07.080
Definitely not

21:07.158 --> 21:09.976
hooking up with some rando.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.980
-(monitors beeping rapidly)
-(grunting)

21:15.166 --> 21:18.025
-Jerome?
-(strained exhale)

21:19.854 --> 21:21.946
Uh... Uh...

21:22.097 --> 21:24.365
Hey, I-I need help in here.

21:28.346 --> 21:29.528
Here.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.606
(labored breathing)

21:32.625 --> 21:35.293
He's burning up.

21:35.444 --> 21:37.369
Fever 104.2.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.339
We're heading into the red zone.
Orders, doctor?

21:42.468 --> 21:43.859
Dr. Daniels.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.694
-(yelps)
-(gasps)

21:45.713 --> 21:47.046
Uh, let's push 30 ketorolac,

21:47.122 --> 21:48.139
get a cooling blanket on him.

21:48.290 --> 21:51.100
-Okay.
-I'll call Dr. Pravesh.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.318
(drill whirring)

22:16.169 --> 22:18.894
Significant hemorrhage
and ecchymosis,

22:18.913 --> 22:20.963
but the compression on the brain
should be much less.

22:22.066 --> 22:23.582
Now, I have to find the source.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.344
100% compartment syndrome.

22:26.604 --> 22:28.971
Thank goodness Conrad
reduced it on-site.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.626
Found the bleeders.

22:34.778 --> 22:36.670
Middle meningeal artery.

22:36.764 --> 22:39.172
Cauterizing now.

22:39.266 --> 22:42.026
Good job, Dr. Sutton.
Now, if I

22:42.195 --> 22:45.771
can just try
not to nick an artery.

22:45.923 --> 22:47.439
Won't be pretty,

22:47.592 --> 22:50.609
but when the swelling goes down,
she'll have a functional arm.

22:50.761 --> 22:52.745
Banner day for the Go Team.

22:54.265 --> 22:57.458
Quick question. Is Bell okay?

22:59.620 --> 23:00.619
What do you mean?

23:00.771 --> 23:03.047
He's a surgeon, not emergency.

23:03.198 --> 23:06.959
Pulled himself from
the board for the entire day.

23:07.111 --> 23:09.536
Austin's taking a case
for him in OR One.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.615
I did not know that.

23:12.708 --> 23:15.559
I'm not one to tattle.

23:15.711 --> 23:18.062
Something's up.

23:28.633 --> 23:31.242
(high-pitched ringing)

23:38.233 --> 23:40.826
AUSTIN:
Uh, pink bowel is healthy.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.145
Gray we resect.

23:43.164 --> 23:44.905
BP's dropping to the 70s.
Heart rate's 130.

23:44.999 --> 23:48.834
Cranking pressors. She's already
had four liters of fluid.

23:48.986 --> 23:51.429
We got a bit of luck here.
Looks like the blood vessels

23:51.597 --> 23:53.580
escaped getting torn apart.

23:53.674 --> 23:55.674
I've got eyes on the duodenum.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.435
First part of jejunum
looks good.

23:57.662 --> 24:00.162
-(monitors beeping rapidly)
-Oh, no.

24:00.255 --> 24:03.015
Bowels are leaking
into the abdomen.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.591
AUSTIN:
All right,
find the healthy margins

24:04.685 --> 24:06.927
and staple them, both sides.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.855
LEELA:
We're at 100 centimeters.

24:10.007 --> 24:12.098
Now 125. 150's the limit.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.842
She's gonna be at risk
for short gut syndrome.

24:14.011 --> 24:15.936
I'm about to
clip the next segment.

24:16.030 --> 24:17.604
(button clicks)

24:17.623 --> 24:19.773
<i> (over speaker):</i>
<i> Uh, s-slow down.</i>

24:19.867 --> 24:21.292
<i> You can adjust to make the</i>

24:21.443 --> 24:23.185
<i> viable tissue a little more</i>
<i> visible in the field.</i>

24:23.204 --> 24:26.947
<i> Clip, and then you can staple,</i>
<i> and... toss.</i>

24:27.041 --> 24:28.966
<i> AUSTIN: This is my OR,</i>
<i> thank you very much.</i>

24:29.117 --> 24:33.337
However,
good advice is good advice.

24:33.564 --> 24:36.974
Adjusting to get a better view.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.886
Just under
150 centimeters total.

24:41.038 --> 24:42.146
CHU:
BP's coming up.

24:42.373 --> 24:43.555
Backing off pressors.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.465
(chuckles) Right.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.359
Good call, Bell.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.372
(siren wailing)

25:02.226 --> 25:04.409
-(screaming)
-(speaking Creole)

25:04.504 --> 25:06.462
(heavy breathing)

25:11.994 --> 25:13.511
How far are we from Chastain?

25:13.662 --> 25:15.829
20 minutes.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.515
Ever delivered a baby before?

25:17.666 --> 25:18.849
A few.

25:19.001 --> 25:20.351
Ever delivered one
in a moving ambulance?

25:20.502 --> 25:22.911
This day just keeps getting
more and more interesting.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.246
It's one for the record books.

25:24.339 --> 25:28.234
-(gasps sharply)
-(speaking Creole)

25:35.701 --> 25:36.942
(knock on door)

25:37.094 --> 25:38.944
Hey. That was
good work with your

25:39.096 --> 25:40.763
hematoma and compartment
syndrome patient.

25:40.781 --> 25:43.265
It'll be a tough recovery,
but she should make it.

25:43.358 --> 25:45.543
You checked in on us
during surgery?

25:45.770 --> 25:49.104
N-No. I-I got the report
from Jessica.

25:49.197 --> 25:52.124
Oh, by the way,
is Conrad back yet?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.642
No.

25:53.702 --> 25:57.096
-What do you want with Conrad?
-He wanted to see me.

25:58.799 --> 26:00.057
AJ mentioned that you were

26:00.284 --> 26:03.185
in his bowel trauma in OR Two.

26:05.122 --> 26:06.622
It is my area of expertise.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.124
Thought I could be there
if they ran into the weeds.

26:09.143 --> 26:11.551
He said you made a good call.

26:11.629 --> 26:14.054
Uh, it was nothing.

26:14.148 --> 26:17.074
Really. I was superfluous.

26:17.225 --> 26:18.409
(sighs)

26:18.578 --> 26:21.495
No other procedures that need
your experienced hands?

26:23.231 --> 26:25.958
I understand you've canceled
your surgeries.

26:28.162 --> 26:30.278
Yeah, I felt
some flu-like symptoms,

26:30.331 --> 26:34.407
just a touch--
it's an abundance of caution.

26:34.501 --> 26:35.742
Of course.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.761
(sighs)

26:41.917 --> 26:44.143
No fever.

26:48.165 --> 26:50.515
Perhaps, when you feel up to it,

26:50.668 --> 26:53.319
you'll tell me
what's really going on.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.444
How's it going?

27:11.538 --> 27:13.947
Fever spiked to 105,
and he's hypotensive.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.557
We broadened his antibiotics,

27:15.559 --> 27:17.134
got cool saline, ice packs,
acetaminophen, ketorolac.

27:17.361 --> 27:19.285
We finally found a
cooling blanket, but he's so...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.805
-It's not doing a thing.
-WINSTON: Give me
the service dog.

27:21.957 --> 27:23.198
I'll take care of her.

27:23.217 --> 27:25.868
-Come on.
-WINSTON: I think this is beyond

27:25.961 --> 27:28.036
-BooBooBear's expertise.
-(Jerome groans)

27:28.055 --> 27:32.207
Okay. Okay. Good girl.
(smooching)

27:32.226 --> 27:33.984
How'd he get this bad
this quickly?

27:34.136 --> 27:35.844
Whatever it is has been
building in his system for days.

27:35.846 --> 27:37.396
I don't like where it's going.

27:37.548 --> 27:39.490
He was just talking to me
a bit ago, but he's so...

27:39.717 --> 27:40.883
altered. I...

27:40.901 --> 27:42.901
Well, he might need
to be intubated.

27:43.053 --> 27:44.310
Let's get an ABG.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.329
Yeah.

27:56.917 --> 27:59.009
-Hold on, hold on.
-Here.

27:59.753 --> 28:02.662
Your patient. You do it.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.223
Okay.

28:14.843 --> 28:16.509
Okay.

28:16.603 --> 28:19.697
(Jerome groaning softly)

28:21.183 --> 28:22.366
Oh, come on. He-he won't settle.
This is awful.

28:22.517 --> 28:23.775
-I can't do this.
-I'll hold him.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.351
Got it.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.121
(groaning)

28:28.432 --> 28:29.415
Okay.

28:32.861 --> 28:34.211
I'm in.

28:35.773 --> 28:37.297
(exhales)

28:48.452 --> 28:50.619
Oh! Uh...

28:50.637 --> 28:52.621
-Hold pressure, quick. Come on.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:52.639 --> 28:53.856
Hold pressure.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.310
-Did you check
his platelets and INR?
-Of course.

28:58.386 --> 29:00.720
160 and 1.8. Not normal,
but not catastrophic.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.799
Well, they must be getting
worse. He's not clotting.

29:03.892 --> 29:06.392
Possibly in DIC or liver
failure. He's decompensating.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.653
I don't understand
what's happening. Explain.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.489
(sighs) I can't.

29:10.641 --> 29:12.565
We can't fix him if we
don't know what's wrong,

29:12.659 --> 29:15.068
and we're running out of time.

29:15.162 --> 29:16.587
(stammers) Wait.
You mean he could die?

29:16.738 --> 29:17.904
-I...
-Hundley.

29:17.998 --> 29:20.332
35-year-old woman,

29:20.484 --> 29:22.000
BP steady, pulse in the 70s,

29:22.152 --> 29:23.668
but also we have a newborn male,

29:23.821 --> 29:25.170
healthy, Apgar off the charts.

29:25.322 --> 29:27.580
Who could use labor and delivery
and an OB-GYN.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.541
CONRAD:
She gave birth in the ambulance.

29:29.693 --> 29:30.842
Peachtree and Seventh.

29:30.995 --> 29:32.010
Perfect corner
to come into the world.

29:32.162 --> 29:34.420
-Great deli there, too.
-(chuckles)

29:34.515 --> 29:35.421
(speaking Creole)

29:35.441 --> 29:38.683
-(responds in Creole)
<i> -Mèsi.</i>

29:38.778 --> 29:40.260
DEVON:
Hey, Conrad, listen.

29:40.354 --> 29:43.188
We've got a 30-year-old male who
came in with a week of fever.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.098
No clear source,
and he's going downhill

29:45.175 --> 29:46.858
fast, and we're
nowhere closer to a diagnosis

29:47.011 --> 29:48.026
than when he first came in.

29:48.178 --> 29:50.012
We need all the help we can get.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.530
The antipyretics,
cooling blankets,

29:51.682 --> 29:53.015
antibiotics,
none of it's making him better.

29:53.033 --> 29:54.274
He's going into shock.

29:54.368 --> 29:56.126
We're gonna get started
on norepinephrine.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.203
Let's get him to the ICU.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.205
Still waiting on a bed.
ICU is short-handed today.

30:00.357 --> 30:02.966
Well, we can't keep him
down here indefinitely.

30:03.118 --> 30:04.359
I'm double board certified.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.878
Emergency med
and intensive care.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.046
If there's anything
I can do to help.

30:08.198 --> 30:09.047
DEVON:
This is my patient.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.123
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

30:10.217 --> 30:11.716
Do you have privileges here?

30:11.811 --> 30:14.703
He has a point.

30:14.721 --> 30:16.538
I'm vouching for her.

30:16.631 --> 30:18.798
I'll get Kit
to meet us in the ICU.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.208
CONRAD:
Sounds good.

30:20.227 --> 30:22.027
Let's grab you some scrubs.

30:44.326 --> 30:46.176
Hi. I'm Chastain's CEO,
Kit Voss.

30:46.403 --> 30:49.421
Thanks for pitching in.
I know we're desperately

30:49.497 --> 30:51.907
short-staffed here in the unit,
but I have to clear you.

30:51.925 --> 30:54.593
Understood.
My name is Kincaid Sullivan.

30:54.761 --> 30:56.002
I'm an ER doctor,

30:56.096 --> 30:57.503
and I also cover the ICU
at Atlanta General.

30:57.598 --> 30:59.247
You can call them
for recommendations.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.507
-And the state board, of course.
-CONRAD: Hey, Go Team.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.193
You with us?

31:04.438 --> 31:07.364
I'm issuing you privileges
on an emergency basis.

31:07.515 --> 31:09.274
Come to my office
when you have a moment,

31:09.426 --> 31:11.159
and we'll do the paperwork.

31:12.946 --> 31:15.855
Ejection fraction's at 15%.

31:15.949 --> 31:18.283
His heart is failing, too.
Damn it.

31:18.435 --> 31:21.211
She's the ICU doctor.
She should run the room.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.131
(sighs) Go.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.383
Okay, as far as I can tell,

31:26.534 --> 31:28.777
we've got a 30-year-old man,
otherwise healthy,

31:28.795 --> 31:30.387
febrile,

31:30.538 --> 31:31.871
now in multisystem
organ failure,

31:31.965 --> 31:33.115
with undifferentiated shock,

31:33.133 --> 31:35.708
respiratory failure,
liver failure,

31:35.728 --> 31:37.543
all complicated by disseminated

31:37.638 --> 31:40.213
intravascular coagulopathy?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.231
That cover it?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.567
No urine output
in the last three hours.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.144
Add renal failure to the list.

31:46.296 --> 31:49.055
He's nearly maxed out
on norepi and vaso.

31:49.149 --> 31:50.908
I think we should start
epi next.

31:51.059 --> 31:53.726
Agreed, but he needs
more access.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.747
We'll need to place four lines,
minimum, a central,

31:56.898 --> 31:59.750
-a dialysis catheter.
-An arterial, and a PA-line.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.238
All right, team.
Let's keep this man alive

32:05.407 --> 32:08.258
long enough to find out
what's wrong with him.

32:09.503 --> 32:10.743
What should I do?

32:10.763 --> 32:12.245
Go back to the white board

32:12.264 --> 32:14.506
and go over
every detail we know.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.581
Find answers,

32:15.601 --> 32:19.061
and be ready to report back.

32:26.261 --> 32:29.838
My sixth surgery of the day
starts in ten minutes.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.615
Please tell me
this coffee is hot.

32:31.766 --> 32:32.991
That's why God made microwaves.

32:33.101 --> 32:34.843
-Oh, bless you.
-(chuckles)

32:34.861 --> 32:36.769
(coffee pouring)

32:36.789 --> 32:39.623
Ooh. I smell panic.

32:39.774 --> 32:41.366
I'd rather smell a warm muffin.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.942
What's going on?

32:42.962 --> 32:44.035
We have a patient
who started out

32:44.129 --> 32:45.328
with a fever of unknown origin,

32:45.481 --> 32:47.130
and is now
the sickest guy in the unit,

32:47.282 --> 32:50.542
and if we don't get a diagnosis
soon, he's gonna die.

32:50.694 --> 32:53.862
-And this is the differential?
-Uh-huh.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.472
AUSTIN:
Good luck.

32:58.218 --> 33:00.293
I mean, how do they expect me
to figure this out?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.370
I'm supposed to see what
Hawkins and Pravesh don't?

33:02.389 --> 33:04.147
Wild guess,
they're teaching you to look.

33:04.374 --> 33:06.984
BILLIE:
And you may never get an answer.

33:07.060 --> 33:08.226
AUSTIN:
You know, by some estimates,

33:08.378 --> 33:11.046
one in four patients
who die in the ICU

33:11.064 --> 33:12.731
never get properly diagnosed.

33:12.883 --> 33:15.158
Despite our best efforts,
the human body is a mystery

33:15.310 --> 33:17.810
that keeps its secrets
more than a quarter of the time.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.645
-Okay, that's-that's so...
-Imperfect.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.739
Remarkable.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.907
Human.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.334
What have you got?

33:24.561 --> 33:26.169
Well...

33:26.321 --> 33:27.912
everything on that board

33:28.065 --> 33:30.823
and nothing at all.

33:30.917 --> 33:33.401
It's okay.

33:33.420 --> 33:34.660
It happens.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.421
We'll keep looking.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.224
But there is something
you can do for your patient.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.728
What?

33:43.930 --> 33:46.398
(purring softly)

33:50.362 --> 33:51.695
What's going on?

33:51.846 --> 33:53.755
A kid came in, drowning victim.

33:53.774 --> 33:56.258
They couldn't save her.
They tried over an hour.

33:56.426 --> 33:58.927
(sighs) Okay.
I need BooBooBear.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.595
For Jerome.

34:00.597 --> 34:03.932
Aw. I was wrong
about this little pup.

34:03.950 --> 34:06.359
She's really good at her job.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.952
Wait.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.214
-Don't forget this.
-Thanks.

34:27.474 --> 34:30.233
His bacterial cultures
all came back negative.

34:30.385 --> 34:32.794
We have him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics

34:32.813 --> 34:34.296
and added antifungals.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.981
Looks like the labs are negative
for vasculitis and autoimmune.

34:37.134 --> 34:39.576
What if it's something
more insidious?

34:39.727 --> 34:42.487
Like an underlying
malignancy leading to HLH?

34:42.639 --> 34:44.730
It's a good thought, but
the ferritin isn't consistent.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.249
-Ingestions?
-CONRAD: Tox screen, negative.

34:46.401 --> 34:47.809
Extended panel, negative.

34:47.828 --> 34:49.377
This was in the dog's backpack.

34:50.071 --> 34:51.737
-A map?
-Uh-huh.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.573
A trail map to a state park.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.759
We've already established
the dog's feet

34:55.928 --> 34:57.594
never touch the ground,
and we've already

34:57.821 --> 34:58.987
-tested for Lyme.
-No, no, no.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.913
Boo's feet
didn't touch the ground,

35:00.933 --> 35:03.158
but Jerome's have.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.677
In a Georgia state park,
where there are other

35:05.771 --> 35:07.345
tick-borne diseases,
not just Lyme.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.647
I looked it up.

35:08.756 --> 35:11.108
It could be babesiosis.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.113
Babesiosis is rare.

35:16.264 --> 35:18.949
So rare we never considered it.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.024
But the symptoms fit.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.767
It's an incredible long shot.

35:21.845 --> 35:23.936
But possible.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.513
So we start him on clindamycin

35:25.607 --> 35:28.683
and quinine, stat,
and if the smear is positive,

35:28.702 --> 35:31.169
we start pheresis.

35:32.873 --> 35:36.424
No matter if this is wrong
or right, good work, Trevor.

35:52.709 --> 35:53.650
Hello.

35:53.877 --> 35:55.652
Hi.

35:55.879 --> 35:57.045
How's Jerome?

35:57.063 --> 36:00.548
Blood test confirmed babesiosis.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.569
-Wow.
-Yeah, he's responding
to the meds.

36:04.721 --> 36:07.555
His fever is still high,
but it's coming down.

36:07.574 --> 36:09.908
Incredible save.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.060
Who was that kid? An intern?

36:12.078 --> 36:14.579
He's gonna be one of our best.

36:14.731 --> 36:16.564
All credit to him.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.258
And to the team. You...

36:19.569 --> 36:21.236
You ran the room.

36:21.238 --> 36:24.572
Does every day on the job
with you go like this one?

36:24.666 --> 36:25.998
Just one surprise

36:26.092 --> 36:28.167
-after another?
-No, thank God.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.836
Today was particularly intense.

36:30.931 --> 36:33.565
And I still don't know
your name.

36:34.918 --> 36:36.342
I don't know yours, either.

36:36.436 --> 36:37.602
Although, "Hey, you"

36:37.679 --> 36:40.588
-worked surprisingly well.
-Conrad Hawkins.

36:40.607 --> 36:42.941
Kincaid Sullivan.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.350
Cade to friend and foe alike.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.412
I'd like to have a word
with your foes.

36:48.765 --> 36:51.374
No, you wouldn't. Believe me.

36:56.030 --> 36:59.624
I'm gonna guess you were in
Haiti doing earthquake relief.

36:59.776 --> 37:01.534
Twice.

37:01.628 --> 37:03.386
How long you been
at Atlanta General?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.965
Not long.

37:07.117 --> 37:09.059
What's with the third degree?

37:10.044 --> 37:12.470
Dr. Pravesh, Jerome's doctor,

37:12.622 --> 37:15.248
is gonna be spending more time
doing clinical trials,

37:15.250 --> 37:18.068
and we need somebody to fill
his slot in the ER, so...

37:18.219 --> 37:20.962
He's having a hard time
finding good people.

37:20.981 --> 37:22.739
You seem
like good people.

37:23.817 --> 37:25.742
-Is that a job offer?
-No.

37:25.893 --> 37:28.245
That's up to Dr. Voss, our CEO.

37:28.396 --> 37:31.823
But Pravesh
already talked to her.

37:33.159 --> 37:35.460
She's making a few calls.
She'd like to talk to you.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.467
Thanks.

37:46.506 --> 37:48.014
(door opens)

37:48.750 --> 37:50.475
I don't remember much.

37:51.961 --> 37:53.678
I guess it got bad.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.921
It did.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.181
Don't go hiking
in the woods again

37:57.350 --> 37:59.925
without buttoning up your shirt,
tucking your pants

37:59.945 --> 38:01.686
into your socks,
and wearing a hat, okay?

38:01.838 --> 38:03.021
Trust me, I won't.

38:03.189 --> 38:05.615
I might not ever leave
my apartment again.

38:05.692 --> 38:07.367
(chuckles)

38:11.364 --> 38:14.499
I'll be back to check
on you later, okay?

38:19.539 --> 38:21.298
How does it feel?

38:21.525 --> 38:24.092
Making a diagnosis
no one else could make?

38:25.695 --> 38:27.137
Feels good.

38:27.364 --> 38:30.532
It was one of the good days.
We live for these.

38:30.550 --> 38:33.226
You were the hero.

38:35.129 --> 38:37.731
And I'm proud of what you did.

38:40.393 --> 38:42.193
Thanks.

38:44.214 --> 38:46.064
We have to care
about our patients, Trevor,

38:46.216 --> 38:48.399
but this could've gone
the other way.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.160
If it had,

38:50.311 --> 38:52.412
it would not have been
your fault.

39:02.065 --> 39:04.323
That was odd.

39:04.343 --> 39:05.324
What's that?

39:05.418 --> 39:08.970
She keeps on being nice to me.

39:10.924 --> 39:14.100
Possible she has a heart?

39:16.021 --> 39:19.430
She does have a heart, Trevor.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.358
Bigger than you know.

39:23.086 --> 39:24.752
Fever's still high, but he's
starting to feel better.

39:24.771 --> 39:26.696
Hey, guys.

39:26.773 --> 39:28.031
Dr. Sullivan checks out.

39:28.182 --> 39:30.608
The folks at Atlanta General
sang her praises.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.869
Though, she's only
been there a few months.

39:33.096 --> 39:34.704
Well, where was she before that?

39:34.856 --> 39:37.356
An ER in Chicago, also briefly.

39:37.450 --> 39:40.284
Before that, there's
a two-year gap in her record.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.379
Yeah, she said she spent
some time in Haiti

39:42.547 --> 39:44.789
-doing earthquake relief.
-She told me that as well.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.866
Well, how'd she do
on her interview?

39:46.960 --> 39:48.033
We didn't talk for long,

39:48.128 --> 39:50.612
but she's obviously
smart and capable.

39:50.746 --> 39:54.298
I could see her ICU
leadership was top notch.

39:54.467 --> 39:55.283
But?

39:55.452 --> 39:58.377
She was a bit evasive, frankly.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.954
Like she was hiding something.

40:00.047 --> 40:02.640
Did you hire her temporarily?
We need someone now.

40:02.792 --> 40:04.142
KIT:
Yes,

40:04.236 --> 40:06.069
but if we're going to make her
a permanent hire,

40:06.296 --> 40:08.405
I'll need more information,

40:08.632 --> 40:10.407
considerably more.

40:12.469 --> 40:13.743
(sighs)

40:13.912 --> 40:15.078
That's odd.

40:15.229 --> 40:16.746
Eh, she wasn't real talkative

40:16.915 --> 40:18.248
about her past with me, either,

40:18.399 --> 40:20.917
but she's a hell of a doctor.
I'd hate to lose her.

40:20.994 --> 40:23.661
Well, you'd be amazed at what
a five-minute Internet search

40:23.755 --> 40:25.422
can dig up on a person.

40:25.573 --> 40:27.999
That's worth a look.

40:28.151 --> 40:30.260
So, one in two people

40:30.429 --> 40:33.671
leave their social media
open to the public.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.006
Pay attention

40:35.158 --> 40:36.340
and you can find out
somebody's favorite color

40:36.509 --> 40:37.825
and who they dated
in high school.

40:37.844 --> 40:40.252
-(chuckles)
-All right.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.512
Kincaid.

40:41.665 --> 40:42.847
Sullivan.

40:42.999 --> 40:46.258
M.D. Atlanta, Georgia.

40:46.427 --> 40:47.610
Huh.

40:47.762 --> 40:51.114
No Facebook. No Insta.

40:51.265 --> 40:54.342
Okay, um, I'll try
broadening the search.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.371
I'll add her work history
and education.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.275
No results.

41:03.295 --> 41:07.380
Try changing the spelling
of her name.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.425
Add that she's an ER doc.

41:13.713 --> 41:15.863
Nothing.

41:15.882 --> 41:18.558
Not a single hit.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.980
That's weird.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.815
Given that she's not
an 80-year-old

41:25.967 --> 41:27.466
with a flip phone, yeah.

41:27.544 --> 41:30.712
It's like someone scrubbed
her entire Internet presence.

41:30.730 --> 41:33.198
(pager beeping)

41:35.810 --> 41:38.161
Test results.

41:38.388 --> 41:40.555
Patient's been waiting
for them all day.

41:40.648 --> 41:42.406
Go.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.075
I'll keep digging.

41:44.227 --> 41:47.245
-(Devon sighs)
-Yeah, thanks.

41:47.397 --> 41:49.130
Yeah.

42:02.746 --> 42:05.438
I've got what we need now.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.484
I think I know what's going on.

42:13.681 --> 42:15.990
Let's sit down.
