00:41.467 --> 00:43.458
Is it supposed to be doing that?

00:43.547 --> 00:47.665
It's a coronal mass emission,
like a giant solar flare.

00:48.107 --> 00:51.622
- But it's safe, right?
- That's what this equipment will find out.

00:51.707 --> 00:57.100
Apart from disrupting the magnetic field,
it might cause an increase in radiation.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.064
But it's safe, right?

00:59.147 --> 01:02.423
As long as we don't
stay here too long, yes, sir.

01:02.507 --> 01:04.896
Anyone explain that to Daniel?

01:12.107 --> 01:14.780
I've encountered this script before.

01:14.867 --> 01:19.861
It's, uh, similar in pronunciation to
a language on our planet called Latin.

01:22.227 --> 01:26.140
As near as I can tell, the main body of
the text represents a planetary history.

01:26.227 --> 01:30.778
I agree... But isn't it time for you
to return through the Stargate?

01:30.867 --> 01:36.066
I don't understand the significance of
what this is. A sort of control mechanism.

01:36.707 --> 01:41.656
It's obviously still in working order.
I wonder if that's... significant.

01:42.627 --> 01:46.620
The storm is approaching, Dr. Jackson.
The radiation may be dangerous for you.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.665
Oh, yes. Major Carter will let us
know when we have to leave.

01:49.747 --> 01:55.105
<i>Now, this line recurs several times:
"Domavatus vestul motabilum. "</i>

01:56.307 --> 01:58.184
"Conqueror of time."

01:58.267 --> 02:01.782
In this context, I'd say more like
"Master of the uncertain past."

02:01.867 --> 02:04.859
- You're a skilled linguist, Dr. Jackson.
- Thank you.

02:04.947 --> 02:08.656
I had the opportunity to hear the language
spoken a year or so ago, so...

02:11.987 --> 02:13.306
What's that?

02:13.387 --> 02:17.665
The geomagnetic disturbance
is reaching its peak. I have to act now.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.586
I don't understand.

02:54.147 --> 02:56.183
- All set up, sir.
- Good.

02:56.827 --> 02:58.658
Let's hit it.

02:58.747 --> 03:01.056
Daniel, let's go home.

03:05.907 --> 03:07.135
Daniel?

03:15.747 --> 03:19.057
- O'Neill.
- Yeah, I hear it.

03:35.587 --> 03:38.181
Incoming wormhole.

03:43.347 --> 03:44.985
<i>What is that?</i>

03:45.627 --> 03:47.424
I have no idea, sir.

03:52.627 --> 03:54.504
Are you doin' this?

03:54.747 --> 03:57.705
- Stay away!
- What the hell are you doing?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.098
Stay back!

04:04.787 --> 04:06.106
Colonel!

04:08.947 --> 04:12.542
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry, but that just
happens to be how I feel about it.</i>

04:12.627 --> 04:15.016
<i>What do you think?</i>

04:21.307 --> 04:23.298
What?

04:25.987 --> 04:28.740
What do you think?

04:31.027 --> 04:34.019
Colonel? Is something wrong?

04:35.227 --> 04:37.422
Maybe.

05:44.227 --> 05:46.661
Weren't we just somewhere else?

05:48.027 --> 05:49.983
- Where?
- Some planet.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.056
- When?
- Just now.

05:51.147 --> 05:52.341
- No.
- Sure?

05:52.427 --> 05:54.497
Yeah.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.618
Everything just changed.

06:03.707 --> 06:07.256
Sir, we've been sitting in the commissary
for the past half-hour.

06:07.347 --> 06:10.783
- Really?
- You've gotten the two places confused.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.307
- We're gonna be late for the briefing.
- Briefing?

06:17.827 --> 06:22.343
Are you OK, or are you just trying
to avoid answering my question?

06:23.947 --> 06:26.142
No, I'm fine.

06:27.907 --> 06:30.102
What question?

06:38.587 --> 06:44.344
Two weeks ago, SG-15 took these images
of solar activity on P4X-639.

06:44.427 --> 06:48.261
Analysis of the data indicates
a steady increase in the intensity.

06:48.347 --> 06:51.783
Now, if I'm right, the explosions
that we're witnessing here...

06:51.867 --> 06:54.859
...are just the precursor
to a greater violent ejection.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.826
Major Carter? Have we not previously
been briefed concerning this matter?

06:58.907 --> 07:01.421
- I was just gonna say that.
- Sir?

07:02.907 --> 07:07.423
You wanna go to the planet and set up
some kind of remote observatory.

07:08.867 --> 07:10.903
- Yes.
- We just did that.

07:11.147 --> 07:13.342
- No, we didn't.
- I believe we did.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.383
No, that's what the briefing is about.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.265
I remember listening to Carter prattle on...

07:18.347 --> 07:21.464
...about solar activity
and a... corona something.

07:21.547 --> 07:24.107
Coronal mass emissions.
I was about to bring it up.

07:24.187 --> 07:28.305
- There you go. How would I know that?
- Maybe you read my report.

07:29.227 --> 07:31.616
Maybe he read your report?

07:34.547 --> 07:37.300
I'm tellin' you guys,
we've done this before.

07:37.827 --> 07:39.818
I am in agreement with O'Neill.

07:39.907 --> 07:44.139
I am experiencing a great deal
of familiarity with these events.

07:44.227 --> 07:46.741
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

07:55.027 --> 07:57.495
We have an unscheduled
incoming traveller, sir.

07:57.587 --> 08:00.624
<i>- It's SG-12.
- They're not due for days.</i>

08:00.707 --> 08:03.699
<i>Receiving GDO transmission.</i>

08:06.947 --> 08:08.778
It's SG-12.

08:11.947 --> 08:14.939
- Open the iris.
- One of them will be injured.

08:27.947 --> 08:31.986
- What do you make of all of this, Major?
- Well, sir, I'm not sure.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.264
SG-12's early return
was the result of an accident.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.496
One of the team fell and broke his ankle.

08:37.587 --> 08:41.057
How could Teal'c and Colonel O'Neill
know that was going to happen?

08:41.147 --> 08:45.186
Both of them claim to have memories
of SG-1's mission to P4X-639.

08:45.267 --> 08:48.976
A mission that isn't scheduled
to start for six hours.

08:57.747 --> 09:01.945
OK. So Sam was setting up instruments,
and... where was I?

09:02.707 --> 09:05.346
You were by the altar deal with the guy.

09:05.827 --> 09:09.866
Right. You're gonna need
to be a little more specific.

09:11.387 --> 09:12.661
Malikai.

09:12.747 --> 09:16.865
That's the alien archaeologist
SG-15 met on the first survey.

09:16.947 --> 09:20.257
- I was looking forward to meeting him.
- You did.

09:20.347 --> 09:22.656
You got along swell.

09:23.787 --> 09:28.383
Anyway, a beam shot out from the ruins
around the altar and hit the Stargate.

09:29.747 --> 09:32.056
There was a blinding flash of light.

09:32.147 --> 09:35.981
Then I was back in the commissary
eating my Froot Loops.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.381
I can't find anything wrong
with either of them.

09:42.467 --> 09:47.018
We'll wait for the lab results to be sure,
but they appear to be in perfect health.

09:47.107 --> 09:50.065
Except for remembering events
that haven't happened yet.

09:50.427 --> 09:55.023
- But why Jack and Teal'c and not us?
- I'm not takin' any chances.

09:55.107 --> 09:59.897
Until we figure out what's going on,
I'm postponing your mission to P4X-639.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.662
Jack. Wait up.

10:15.307 --> 10:20.586
Um... I was thinking about what you said
about, uh, a beam coming out of the altar.

10:20.667 --> 10:24.740
SG-15 took digital images
of the carvings on the ruins.

10:25.027 --> 10:27.587
I was thinking there might be
some sort of clue.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.977
Unfortunately it's the equivalent
of 400 pages of alien text.

10:31.067 --> 10:34.457
If you give me details about
the layout of the ruins...

10:36.507 --> 10:38.782
Gee, sorry, Dr. Jackson.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.296
Shoulda seen that comin'.

10:53.107 --> 10:54.062
So...

10:54.907 --> 10:56.056
So?

10:57.587 --> 11:00.226
Don't you know what I'm gonna say?

11:00.307 --> 11:04.585
Actually, by this time
we were on the planet.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.578
It's all different now.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.656
Oh.

11:07.747 --> 11:12.867
Well, I was thinking about what you said
about a beam hitting the Stargate.

11:12.947 --> 11:15.177
- What about it?
- After the flash,...

11:15.267 --> 11:19.385
...you found yourself back here, reliving
the moments leading up to the mission.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.225
Maybe you're not
remembering future events.

11:23.307 --> 11:27.266
- Maybe you were sent back in time.
- For what? Six hours?

11:27.347 --> 11:32.421
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
The Stargate did send us back to 1969.

11:33.347 --> 11:35.338
Good year.

11:35.427 --> 11:41.059
So could this beam be a means
to access the gate's subspace field...

11:41.147 --> 11:45.538
...in order to create some kind of
time inversion outside of subspace?

11:50.507 --> 11:53.101
I knew you were gonna say that.

11:53.827 --> 11:56.182
I guess I'm just thinkin' out loud.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.861
I'm gonna go run a few simulations.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.181
You run... Simulate.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.659
Let me know how it turns out.
Keep me posted.

12:11.907 --> 12:14.057
Keep me apprised.

12:20.067 --> 12:24.618
The lab results confirm Dr. Fraiser's
assessment. You're both in perfect health.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.666
- Any more of these premonitions?
- Not for some time.

12:30.747 --> 12:33.261
Can we go back to work, General, please?

12:33.347 --> 12:35.702
I have no objection, as long as...

12:35.787 --> 12:38.301
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

12:40.747 --> 12:42.738
D'oh!

12:53.187 --> 12:55.178
What is that?

12:55.267 --> 12:58.543
I'm not sure, sir.
I've never seen anything like it.

12:58.627 --> 13:00.618
We have.

13:01.907 --> 13:05.502
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry, but that just
happens to be how I feel about it.</i>

13:05.587 --> 13:07.976
<i>What do you think?</i>

13:13.627 --> 13:16.221
Colonel? Is something wrong?

13:17.187 --> 13:19.337
Oh, yeah.

13:19.427 --> 13:21.418
Somethin'.

13:24.707 --> 13:27.505
- Two weeks ago, SG-15...
- We've done this.

13:30.467 --> 13:33.027
We do this every day.

13:33.107 --> 13:36.622
<i>Not briefings in general, Daniel.
I'm talking about this briefing.</i>

13:36.707 --> 13:39.540
I'm talking about this day.

13:43.467 --> 13:48.905
Colonel O'Neill is correct. Events do
appear to be repeating themselves.

13:49.107 --> 13:52.622
- Since when?
- Since we went to P4X-639.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.858
We haven't been to P4X-639.

13:54.947 --> 13:58.735
Yes, we have. "No, we haven't."
That's what you were gonna say.

13:58.827 --> 14:03.218
- Of course that's what I was gonna say.
- OK, bad example.

14:03.307 --> 14:07.380
- I'm not quite sure what to make of this.
- If we've had this meeting before, sir...

14:07.467 --> 14:12.097
Why are Teal'c and I the only ones who
remember it? You said that last time.

14:12.187 --> 14:16.021
Well, I'll venture a guess it has
something to do with that planet.

14:17.587 --> 14:21.375
And you'll all believe me when
SG-12 comes through that gate in...

14:21.467 --> 14:24.106
...four, three, two, one...

14:33.627 --> 14:36.061
SG-12 isn't due back for three days.

14:36.827 --> 14:40.058
<i>- Unscheduled offworld activation.
- So close.</i>

14:53.467 --> 14:58.177
- You're not gonna find anything.
- Why don't we wait for the lab results?

14:58.267 --> 15:01.339
- The results will be negative.
- Humour me.

15:03.067 --> 15:08.187
General... I know you're thinking of
postponing the mission. There's no point.

15:08.267 --> 15:10.861
You tried it last time. It didn't work.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.862
Jack. Wait up.

15:24.267 --> 15:29.705
Um... I was thinking about what you said
about a beam coming from the altar.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.097
400 pages of alien text.

15:34.667 --> 15:39.104
Right... SG-15 took digital images
of the carvings on the ruins.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.098
- Looks familiar.
- It should.

15:43.187 --> 15:45.417
It's something that
you spoke for a few days.

15:45.507 --> 15:48.897
It's a variation of the writings
used by the Ancients.

15:48.987 --> 15:53.060
If you're lookin' for help translating it,
you're barkin' up the wrong genius.

15:53.147 --> 15:58.141
No, I realise the Asgards returned you to
normal, which is fortunate, I... suppose.

15:58.427 --> 16:02.705
But if you give me details about
the layout of the ruins it might be...

16:03.907 --> 16:06.182
Gee, sorry, Dr. Jackson.

16:06.387 --> 16:07.979
Oops.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.626
Come in.

16:16.827 --> 16:20.183
- Any word from Fraiser?
- Still waiting for the lab results.

16:20.267 --> 16:22.576
If we delay any longer it will be too late.

16:24.307 --> 16:28.016
- Too late for what?
- To stop this day from happening again.

16:28.107 --> 16:30.985
You realise this is
a little difficult for me to accept.

16:31.107 --> 16:33.746
Hey, if it was just me, I'd agree.

16:33.827 --> 16:38.105
But what about Teal'c?
Come on! Is this the face of a crazy man?

16:43.987 --> 16:46.660
- Bad example.
- What do you want?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.496
We wanna go back to 639.

17:04.507 --> 17:08.215
A geomagnetic storm is building up.
We shouldn't stay long.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.616
That's the machine right there.

17:12.146 --> 17:16.220
- I wonder how it works.
- Subspace fields and time inversions.

17:17.146 --> 17:18.785
That's what you said.

17:23.666 --> 17:26.420
- Hello.
- Whoa. Easy, guys.

17:26.507 --> 17:29.465
That's the guy.
He's the one who started all this.

17:29.907 --> 17:32.580
- I don't understand.
- Whatever you did, undo it.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.739
- I did nothing.
- I don't think he knows what you mean.

17:35.907 --> 17:38.501
- Perhaps he has no memory, O'Neill.
- He remembers.

17:38.587 --> 17:40.623
He's the one who pushed those buttons.

17:40.707 --> 17:44.177
Please. I'm, uh, an archaeologist...

17:44.947 --> 17:48.257
I've been trying to translate
these alien symbols.

17:48.347 --> 17:51.225
- I told the others who came before you.
- SG-15?

17:51.747 --> 17:54.466
Yes... But they didn't
point weapons at me.

17:56.347 --> 17:58.577
I can show you my notes...

17:59.187 --> 18:02.896
I've been making periodic visits
to this planet for quite some time now.

18:02.987 --> 18:05.581
My research is almost complete.

18:09.907 --> 18:12.979
What kind of archaeologist
carries a weapon?

18:13.427 --> 18:14.655
Uh...

18:14.747 --> 18:16.260
I do.

18:17.587 --> 18:19.782
Bad example.

18:31.707 --> 18:35.620
- What's this?
- If you must know... it's my wife.

18:47.867 --> 18:51.303
- What'd you do?
- Nothing. It engaged on its own.

18:51.587 --> 18:53.179
- Turn it off.
- How?

18:53.267 --> 18:56.782
It's drawing energy from
the ionisation in the atmosphere.

18:56.867 --> 18:59.176
There's nothing Major Carter can do.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.861
Excuse me? How'd you know her name?

19:04.947 --> 19:08.656
- You told me.
- No, I didn't. Not this time around.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.659
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

19:15.467 --> 19:19.142
- How do you shut this thing off?
- Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

19:19.227 --> 19:21.661
Sir, it's building up some kind of charge.

19:21.787 --> 19:25.018
Daniel, you can read this stuff.
Get up here and shut it off.

19:25.107 --> 19:29.464
What? Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't even know where to begin. I...

19:29.547 --> 19:34.746
It would take years of training. I don't
know the material, I don't have enough...

19:35.387 --> 19:39.016
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry, but that just
happens to be how I feel about it.</i>

19:39.107 --> 19:41.496
<i>What do you think?</i>

19:46.587 --> 19:48.862
It's just a question.

19:56.987 --> 20:01.458
All right. Here's the deal. We're all
stuck in a time loop of some kind.

20:01.947 --> 20:05.462
However, Teal'c and I seem to be
the only ones who realise it.

20:05.547 --> 20:07.936
Now, there's this alien device on 639.

20:08.027 --> 20:12.339
It shoots a beam at the Stargate,
which at... subspace something... what?

20:12.427 --> 20:15.863
Accesses the subspace field
the Stargate is capable of generating.

20:15.947 --> 20:21.146
- It is powered by ionisation...
- In the atmosphere, which is caused by...

20:21.227 --> 20:23.502
I know this one.

20:24.787 --> 20:27.540
- Magnets.
- The geomagnetic storm.

20:29.147 --> 20:33.823
Close. Anyway, I don't know why
none of you remember any of this.

20:34.147 --> 20:38.982
But I do know for a fact there's no point
havin' ol' Doc Fraiser examine us again.

20:51.347 --> 20:56.740
I ask you, what could possibly be
in my eye that would explain this?

21:04.907 --> 21:08.900
- What do you make of all this, Major?
- When was the last time Colonel O'Neill...

21:08.987 --> 21:12.502
...used terms like "subspace field"
and "geomagnetic storm"?

21:12.587 --> 21:16.023
- Good point.
- And he actually used them correctly,...

21:16.107 --> 21:18.098
...for the most part.

21:18.187 --> 21:21.577
- You believe him.
- I'm considering the possibility, sir.

21:21.667 --> 21:25.296
The more I think about it, if he's right,
the ramifications are huge.

21:25.387 --> 21:29.585
The next time time loops, we'll forget
this conversation even happened.

21:35.347 --> 21:39.135
- You're better off in here.
- I was just comin' to look for you.

21:39.827 --> 21:42.421
Um, I've translated
a section of the west wall.

21:42.507 --> 21:46.546
- It's some sort of planetary history.
- Daniel, that's very nice.

21:46.627 --> 21:49.664
- But focus on the altar.
- Why?

21:49.747 --> 21:52.705
Malikai initiated the time loop
by manipulating symbols.

21:52.787 --> 21:55.381
Figure out those,
you figure out how to stop this.

21:55.467 --> 21:58.982
Just recognising symbols on a keyboard
doesn't run a computer.

21:59.067 --> 22:03.379
If I can put the device in a proper context,
I can figure out what it's supposed to do.

22:03.467 --> 22:06.504
We know what it does!
It's a time-loop machine.

22:06.587 --> 22:09.818
Uh... Who would build a device
that loops time every ten hours?

22:09.907 --> 22:13.786
- Who knows? But that's what it does.
- Yes, but maybe it's not supposed to.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.506
For all we know, this is
an accidental by-product.

22:20.987 --> 22:22.978
Hello?

22:24.467 --> 22:26.776
OK, we're on our way.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.256
Sam has something.

22:34.307 --> 22:36.298
According to Colonel O'Neill,...

22:36.387 --> 22:40.585
...he and Teal'c witnessed a beam
striking the Stargate on P4X-639.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.181
Then the gate became
energised somehow.

22:43.267 --> 22:48.387
Now, in the second loop, they witnessed
a similar effect in our own gate room.

22:48.747 --> 22:50.658
Sounds about right.

22:50.747 --> 22:53.307
If this is the influence
of alien technology,...

22:53.387 --> 22:57.016
...the effect is being translated
to Earth through the Stargate,...

22:57.107 --> 22:59.223
...in which case the solution is simple.

22:59.307 --> 23:00.979
- We dial out.
- Exactly.

23:01.067 --> 23:03.422
Before this loop
is supposed to begin again,...

23:03.507 --> 23:07.136
...we establish an outgoing wormhole
to, say, the Tollan home world.

23:07.507 --> 23:12.376
Then anyone or anything trying to dial in
from P4X-639 will get a busy signal.

23:15.787 --> 23:17.778
Let's do it.

23:21.947 --> 23:24.415
Chevron five, locked.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.261
Chevron six, locked.

23:40.147 --> 23:42.297
- Chevron seven will not engage.
- What?

23:42.387 --> 23:44.901
It won't lock.
I can't establish a connection.

23:44.987 --> 23:47.455
I'm running a diagnostic.

23:52.147 --> 23:54.217
- Incoming wormhole.
- Close the iris.

23:59.987 --> 24:01.579
Oh, crap.

24:01.667 --> 24:06.536
There is nothing wrong on our end.
We should have been able to dial out.

24:16.267 --> 24:19.225
<i>I'm sorry, but that just
happens to be how I feel about it.</i>

24:19.307 --> 24:21.696
<i>What do you think?</i>

24:23.107 --> 24:25.382
Ask me tomorrow.

24:37.187 --> 24:40.020
Recognising symbols on a keyboard
won't run a computer.

24:40.107 --> 24:42.143
We've been over this!

24:43.307 --> 24:46.697
I'm tellin' you,
the only way to stop this loop...

24:47.867 --> 24:50.381
...is to figure out how to run that stuff!

24:52.427 --> 24:55.942
If we really have had this conversation,
I probably pointed out...

24:56.027 --> 24:58.985
...there's no way I can translate this
in less than a day.

24:59.067 --> 25:03.106
Oh, I'm so ahead of you.
I put the whole thing on tape last time.

25:03.187 --> 25:05.223
So you don't have to start from scratch.

25:13.427 --> 25:15.497
If what you say is true,...

25:15.587 --> 25:20.707
...when the loop started again your
recording wouldn't have happened... yet.

25:23.067 --> 25:26.457
- Right.
- Did I not say that?

25:26.547 --> 25:28.902
Careful! Be careful.

25:30.507 --> 25:33.977
What about notes? Indelible ink?

25:38.387 --> 25:41.459
<i>If you are the only ones
with memories of previous loops,...</i>

25:41.547 --> 25:45.540
...you're gonna have to help me
by learning and remembering.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.617
Fine.

25:51.707 --> 25:54.096
How hard can it be?

26:01.867 --> 26:06.657
According to Colonel O'Neill, we tried
to block the connection to P4X-639...

26:06.747 --> 26:08.738
...but were unable to dial out.

26:08.827 --> 26:14.379
I think that the Earth has become out of
sync with the rest of the gate system,...

26:14.467 --> 26:17.220
...making it impossible for us
to establish contact.

26:17.507 --> 26:19.623
What about SG-12?
They managed to gate in.

26:19.707 --> 26:23.177
I realise that. So we ran
a sequence of random diallings,...

26:23.267 --> 26:25.827
...and this is what we found.

26:25.907 --> 26:28.899
These worlds we were able
to contact, including Alaris,...

26:28.987 --> 26:31.057
...where SG-12 was doing its survey.

26:31.147 --> 26:34.776
But the centre of this group is P4X-639.

26:34.867 --> 26:39.463
I believe the alien device is establishing
simultaneous connection to these gates,...

26:39.547 --> 26:42.300
...creating a kind of... subspace bubble.

26:42.387 --> 26:46.096
And everything within the bubble
is cut off from the normal flow of time.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.257
What are the implications of this?

26:48.347 --> 26:52.659
We could relive the same day thousands
of times, and we'd never know it.

26:53.627 --> 26:56.141
- What can we do?
- Unfortunately, not much.

26:56.387 --> 27:00.539
The next time the loop starts we won't
even remember we had this conversation.

27:00.627 --> 27:03.266
It's up to Teal'c and Colonel O'Neill.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.658
<i>"Poteramus. "</i>

27:07.747 --> 27:10.420
<i>"Poteras... potarat. "</i>

27:11.667 --> 27:15.455
<i>"Crem... eras... cret... cremus. "</i>

27:22.667 --> 27:25.340
This is a bad idea.

27:25.747 --> 27:27.942
It would appear we have no choice.

27:32.747 --> 27:35.625
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

27:35.707 --> 27:38.380
You know the worst part about this?

27:38.947 --> 27:42.417
Every time we loop,
Daniel asks me a question, and...

27:43.427 --> 27:45.702
...I wasn't listening the first time.

27:45.787 --> 27:48.779
You are not the only one who
must endure some discomfort.

27:49.947 --> 27:52.700
Sorry, sir. I didn't realise you were there.

27:53.867 --> 27:56.461
- You have said that on many occasions.
- I...

27:56.547 --> 27:59.539
Perhaps next time
I will not be so forgiving.

28:02.107 --> 28:05.463
<i>Section 23 ends with
a reference to "perennial adventus".</i>

28:07.107 --> 28:11.020
- We've been over this.
- It means "the approaching disaster".

28:14.547 --> 28:17.698
"Of the machine itself,
with recurring use...

28:17.787 --> 28:22.019
...the machine... surrenders
to the rigours of time."

28:22.467 --> 28:24.822
That is incorrect, Daniel Jackson.

28:26.387 --> 28:30.665
<i>The word "abicierum" means
"to give up", not "surrender".</i>

28:32.387 --> 28:37.381
OK, this section of the text seems to deal
primarily with their arrival on P4X-639.

28:37.747 --> 28:42.218
OK, this section of the text seems to deal
primarily with their arrival on P4X-639.

28:42.307 --> 28:46.459
<i>Now this word here, "deductavum",
is a variation of "deductum".</i>

28:46.907 --> 28:51.298
OK, this section of the text seems to deal
primarily with their arrival on P4X-639.

28:51.667 --> 28:56.024
This appears to be a reference to
the gradual degeneration of the machine.

28:56.547 --> 28:58.936
...foundation of a colony.

29:04.227 --> 29:07.697
<i>- Guys? This is important.
- Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

29:11.707 --> 29:16.497
O'Neill... Should we not be assisting
Daniel Jackson with the translation?

29:17.347 --> 29:19.622
I'm taking this loop off.

29:25.827 --> 29:28.387
I'm tellin' you, Teal'c.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.584
If we don't find a way out of this soon,
I'm gonna lose it.

29:33.787 --> 29:37.097
Lose it. It means "go crazy".

29:38.467 --> 29:41.140
Nuts. Insane.

29:41.227 --> 29:44.776
Bonzo. No longer in possession
of one's faculties.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.427
Three fries short of a Happy Meal.

29:47.507 --> 29:48.860
Wacko!

29:59.507 --> 30:01.498
Teal'c.

30:02.827 --> 30:06.263
<i>- Thank you, O'Neill.
- No, no. Thank you, Teal'c.</i>

30:10.667 --> 30:12.862
Oh, God!

30:14.787 --> 30:18.780
<i>Exactly how many of these loops
have you... have we been through?</i>

30:20.107 --> 30:22.177
I've lost track.

30:22.787 --> 30:26.302
- That must be frustrating.
- Uh... Yeah.

30:26.627 --> 30:29.539
On the other hand,
it is kind of an opportunity.

30:30.347 --> 30:32.417
- How's that?
- Well, think about it.

30:32.507 --> 30:37.865
If you know in advance that everything
is going to go back to the way it was,...

30:37.947 --> 30:40.415
...you could do anything
for as long as you want...

30:40.507 --> 30:44.102
...without having to
worry about consequences.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.942
Excuse me.

31:16.187 --> 31:19.862
- Vern, how's the wife?
- Fine... sir.

31:23.147 --> 31:25.138
Oh, yeah!

31:25.827 --> 31:28.022
That'll play.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.855
<i>How far is Alaris, anyway?</i>

31:31.947 --> 31:34.017
Several billion miles, O'Neill.

31:34.107 --> 31:36.302
That's gotta be a record.

31:53.947 --> 31:56.780
<i>Colonel O'Neill,
what the hell are you doing?</i>

31:56.867 --> 31:59.506
In the middle of my backswing?!

32:00.387 --> 32:02.776
Sorry, sir. I didn't realise...

32:08.107 --> 32:10.416
Excuse me, George.

32:10.507 --> 32:12.702
Colonel, what are you
doing out of uniform?

32:12.787 --> 32:16.575
- Handing you my resignation.
- Resigning? What for?

32:16.667 --> 32:19.056
So I can do... this.

32:27.067 --> 32:29.422
What are you smiling at?

32:31.067 --> 32:33.262
Nothin'.

32:42.187 --> 32:46.863
- What have you got for us, Dr. Jackson?
- Uh, with the help of Teal'c and Jack,...

32:47.267 --> 32:49.827
...I've managed
to complete the translation.

32:49.907 --> 32:54.503
As I originally suspected, P4X-639
was once a colony of the Ancients.

32:54.587 --> 32:58.978
They thrived there until they were
struck with some sort of cataclysm,...

32:59.067 --> 33:01.297
...perhaps a disease.

33:01.587 --> 33:05.660
In any case, facing certain destruction,
they built the time machine.

33:05.747 --> 33:08.978
To go back and change their history
to avoid their fate.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.098
Right. But it didn't work.

33:11.187 --> 33:14.497
Instead of sending a team of scientists
back to the key moment,...

33:14.587 --> 33:19.297
...the device caused a continuous loop,
like the one we've been experiencing.

33:19.387 --> 33:24.177
They experienced it hundreds of times
trying to get the machine to work, but...

33:25.147 --> 33:28.696
They gave up. They shut it down
and let the end come.

33:29.547 --> 33:31.822
So the loop can be broken.

33:31.907 --> 33:34.660
Uh, there's a section of text on the altar...

33:34.747 --> 33:38.262
...that deals with the geomagnetic storms
that power the device.

33:38.347 --> 33:41.817
They recur every 50 or so years,
which is why, incidentally, the...

33:41.907 --> 33:43.386
Yes, sir.

33:44.707 --> 33:46.937
The loop can be broken.

33:47.307 --> 33:49.901
I was getting to that.

33:49.987 --> 33:54.617
When we activate the symbols in the right
sequence, I think we can shut it down.

33:55.147 --> 33:58.583
Colonel, have your team geared up
and ready to embark in 30 minutes.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.419
Yes, sir.

34:07.907 --> 34:12.059
A geomagnetic storm is building up.
We shouldn't stay long.

34:12.147 --> 34:13.580
Lucky guess.

34:17.427 --> 34:20.623
- Malikai?
- I don't see anyone, sir.

34:21.947 --> 34:25.462
He's around here somewhere.
He knows we're onto him.

34:35.627 --> 34:37.618
Teal'c?

34:42.467 --> 34:45.583
I'm sorry, but you've come
to break the time loop.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.818
And I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

34:58.587 --> 35:01.055
Get away from that thing.

35:12.747 --> 35:15.705
Sir, it looks like a variation
of a Goa'uld force shield.

35:15.787 --> 35:19.939
It is, Major. I had to trade several
rare artefacts for the field generator,...

35:20.027 --> 35:22.177
...but it was well worth it.

35:22.947 --> 35:28.021
Malikai? We have to reset those controls
or the loop's gonna start all over again.

35:28.107 --> 35:31.577
I'm counting on it. I need more time.

35:32.187 --> 35:35.975
Once I've deciphered the symbols,
I will be able to master the time device.

35:36.187 --> 35:38.576
Why? So you can be
king of Groundhog Day?

35:38.667 --> 35:42.137
Do you think I would do this
for personal power?

35:42.227 --> 35:44.422
She...

35:46.627 --> 35:49.778
- You wouldn't understand.
- What happened?

35:55.307 --> 36:00.825
She died. 12 years ago. When I found
this place and discovered its purpose,...

36:00.907 --> 36:04.616
...I dedicated myself
to unlocking its mysteries.

36:04.707 --> 36:07.096
<i>So you could
go back and save her.</i>

36:07.187 --> 36:11.419
No, that would be quite impossible. She
died from a congenital heart weakness.

36:11.747 --> 36:15.183
Not even the ability to travel time
could change that.

36:15.267 --> 36:17.827
Then why are you doing this?

36:18.267 --> 36:20.735
To be with her once more.

36:22.307 --> 36:25.299
Malikai, the device doesn't work.

36:26.107 --> 36:29.065
- It never did.
- It never did?

36:30.787 --> 36:34.496
- You're living proof.
- We translated the text on the ruins.

36:34.587 --> 36:38.136
The Ancients who built this place
never got it to work.

36:38.227 --> 36:42.425
They tried over and over again,
just like you, but in the end they gave up.

36:42.507 --> 36:46.705
Why do you think this place is deserted?
They couldn't save themselves.

36:47.347 --> 36:51.465
You're wrong. There must be some other
explanation. I know I can make this work.

36:51.547 --> 36:56.223
You can't! They proved it can't be done.
You're just gonna go on like this for ever.

36:56.307 --> 36:59.583
- You'll be trapped.
- Along with billions of innocent others.

37:00.307 --> 37:03.936
This device activates
14 Stargates simultaneously.

37:04.027 --> 37:07.542
That's 14 worlds reliving
the same day over and over.

37:10.107 --> 37:13.941
I, uh... I didn't realise.

37:17.107 --> 37:22.625
But once I am able to input the correct
time coordinates, the loop will be broken.

37:22.707 --> 37:26.143
The people who made that machine
made the Stargates,...

37:26.227 --> 37:28.741
<i>.. and they couldn't get
the damn thing to work.</i>

37:28.827 --> 37:32.422
And even if you could,
just for the sake of argument,...

37:33.347 --> 37:36.339
...you can't change what happened to her.

37:36.427 --> 37:39.578
I can... touch her face again.

37:40.547 --> 37:43.619
Talk with her. Hear her laugh.

37:43.707 --> 37:45.618
- Like you remember?
- Yes.

37:45.707 --> 37:47.982
Then what'll happen?

37:48.987 --> 37:51.376
- She'll die.
- And then what?

37:52.147 --> 37:54.024
You start over?

37:59.667 --> 38:02.022
Listen to me.

38:02.507 --> 38:04.782
- I know what it's like.
- You can't!

38:04.947 --> 38:07.859
I lost my son! I know!

38:13.307 --> 38:15.696
And as much as I...

38:18.267 --> 38:20.861
I could never live that over again.

38:24.787 --> 38:26.618
Could you?

38:36.547 --> 38:37.866
No.

38:41.107 --> 38:43.496
Let her go.

39:54.867 --> 39:58.826
Well, we're still here, Colonel.
I assume you were successful.

39:58.947 --> 40:01.541
Well, General, you know what they say.

40:01.627 --> 40:03.902
If at first you don't succeed,...

40:04.507 --> 40:07.499
...try, try, try...

40:07.587 --> 40:09.976
...try, try... try again.

40:18.827 --> 40:21.864
I don't think I've ever seen
anyone enjoy oatmeal so much.

40:21.947 --> 40:27.067
When you've eaten Froot Loops for who
knows how long... a little variety helps.

40:27.147 --> 40:32.585
We heard from the Tok'ra. They've been
trying to contact us for over three months.

40:33.267 --> 40:34.177
Really?

40:34.267 --> 40:36.497
Who knows when they realised
we were cut off.

40:36.587 --> 40:39.260
I mean, there's no telling
how much time passed.

40:39.347 --> 40:43.863
Let me ask you something.
In all the time you were, um, looping,...

40:43.947 --> 40:47.417
...were you ever tempted
to, um, do something crazy?

40:47.867 --> 40:53.260
I mean, uh... You could do anything
without worrying about consequences.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.301
You know, it's funny.
You've asked me that before.

41:00.067 --> 41:02.058
And?

41:03.305 --> 41:09.552
