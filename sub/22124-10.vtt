Previously onLucifer...

00:03.873 --> 00:05.788
The reason I started
granting favors again

00:05.831 --> 00:07.964
was because of the Sinnerman.CHLOE: Do you think this is

00:08.008 --> 00:09.879
the same guy that kidnapped you
and dumped you in the desert?

00:09.922 --> 00:11.054
I may need proof
that this guy is real.He is real.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.490
And very dangerous.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.362
I quit my job.
Today is my first day

00:14.405 --> 00:16.016
in the district attorney'’s
office. Surprise.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.626
So why is your
gift desire?

00:17.669 --> 00:20.107
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.805
I help people do whatever
or whomever they want.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.199
Hello.SINNERMAN: I thought
you were looking for me.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.114
Come on. Let'’s talk.[door bangs shut]

00:27.157 --> 00:28.637
In here!

00:28.680 --> 00:30.465
You want to do
your little desire shtick?

00:30.508 --> 00:32.902
When I find out
what someone truly desires,

00:32.945 --> 00:35.470
I find out
their greatest weakness.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.298
Why is this case
so important to you?

00:37.341 --> 00:38.908
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.562
I need to make him pay.That'’s him.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.085

00:42.129 --> 00:43.826
You'’re under arrest.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.350
Look into my eyes!

00:47.960 --> 00:49.310
[panting]

00:49.353 --> 00:51.921
Now you will never
know what I want.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.749

00:58.362 --> 01:00.495

911. What is your emergency?[runner panting]

01:00.538 --> 01:03.063
Please, I need help!
He'’s gonna kill me! Please!

01:11.375 --> 01:13.377
LUCIFER [trills]:
Ah-ha!

01:13.421 --> 01:16.511
Nothing screams weekend like
tequila and scantily-clad women.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.339
And tequila. Cheers.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.341
It'’s Wednesday.
Mmm.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.170
Exactly. The party'’s just begun.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.780
Why are we celebrating again?

01:24.823 --> 01:26.521
Well, isn'’t it obvious?

01:26.564 --> 01:29.132
We apprehended the cad who
arranged for my kidnapping,

01:29.176 --> 01:30.525
gave me wings,

01:30.568 --> 01:31.874
took away my devil face.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.877
Finally, Maze,
answers will be mine.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.358
Right.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.187
[woman grunts]If you could say that with less
sarcasm, I'’d appreciate it.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.884
No, no, I'’m sure you're right.

01:41.927 --> 01:45.714
I'’m sure a human jail
will stop a soldier of God.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.585
That'’s actually moresarcasm.

01:47.629 --> 01:48.891
I'’m just saying,

01:48.934 --> 01:50.414
devil face, wings-- big deal.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.808
If he wanted to hit you
where it really hurts,

01:52.851 --> 01:54.897
there are other things
he could do to you,

01:54.940 --> 01:56.725
ortake away.

01:56.768 --> 01:59.206
Oh.
I'’m talking about
your life in L.A., Lucifer.

01:59.249 --> 02:02.252
[laughs]
The club, your job.

02:02.296 --> 02:06.082
Chloe.
I know what you'’re
talking about!

02:06.126 --> 02:07.388
But I won'’t allow it.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.085
I can assure you,
the only threat

02:09.129 --> 02:11.174
the Sinnerman poses from now on
is that ridiculous name.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.089
Mmm.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.439
They'’re bringing him in for
questioning in the morning,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.311
so I'’ll get what I need
to break him then.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.835
Good luck mojoing a blind guy.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.750
[laughs]
I don'’t need eyes

02:21.793 --> 02:25.014
to find out the Sinnerman'’s
desire, ergo his weakness.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.756
There are other ways
to learn what someone wants.

02:27.799 --> 02:28.931
What ways?

02:28.974 --> 02:31.586
Just... ways.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.240
[laughs, whoops]
Oh!

02:33.283 --> 02:34.415
Hello.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.244
It'’s so hard.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.986
Yes, always, but why don'’t I
help you with your stick first?

02:43.815 --> 02:45.948
[people gasping]Go on!

02:45.991 --> 02:47.863
MAN: Oh, condoms!WOMAN:
I'’m gonna enjoy every condom!

02:47.906 --> 02:49.343
MAN:
They'’re the ribbed kind!

02:57.655 --> 02:59.048
T minus ten, people.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.615
MAN:
Yes, sir.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.486
The prisoner is in the house.

03:02.530 --> 03:06.142
Eye on the prize, no screwups,
and no one talks to him alone.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
[indistinct chatter]

03:08.231 --> 03:11.278
Man, I just love
watching Pierce work.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.324
It'’s like a master
class in ass-whoop

03:14.368 --> 03:17.632
with a minor in whatevs.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.547
Yeah.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.289
I'’m just surprised
at how well he'’s holding up.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.204
Well, it is his job.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.640
No. I mean, it'’s just,

03:25.683 --> 03:27.642
there'’s no way
I could be that stoic

03:27.685 --> 03:29.992
if the Sinnerman
had killed my brother.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.255
Wait, what?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.434
I knew the case was personal,
but his own flesh and blood?

03:39.044 --> 03:41.656
Holy bananas, he must
totally need a hug.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.092
Ella, wait.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.659
But Pierce needs our
support right now.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.095
I didn'’t know
it wasn'’t common knowledge.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.924
All right, this isn'’t even
my secret to share.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.579
Right, of course,
'’cause he's so private

03:51.622 --> 03:55.235
and brooding and... hot.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.195
Not that that is
at all relevant.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.849
Look, he'’s on edge.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.242
Just don'’t bring it up, okay?

04:02.285 --> 04:03.286
Okay.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.944
MAN:
Right. Through this way.
Come on.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.251
Keep going this way.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.949
Nice to see you all again.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.518
What. Too soon?Come on.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.433
Yeah, yeah.[Sinnerman laughs]

04:27.919 --> 04:29.878
[sighs]

04:29.921 --> 04:31.793
He'’s certainly
oozing remorse.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.534
Pierce.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.231
We know
he kidnapped Lucifer,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.102
we have physical evidence
tying him to the hair salon,

04:37.146 --> 04:38.452
the kid with broken legs.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.323
I saw him with a gun,

04:40.367 --> 04:42.717
standing over the guy
he shot. Don'’t worry.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.936
At this point, a confession'’s
just icing on the cake.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.242
It'’s over.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.374
Is it?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.245
[door opens]Ah, good.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.639
Just in time for the main event.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.728
Right. Why don'’t you two
make yourselves comfortable,

04:53.771 --> 04:56.165
and I'’ll take first crack
at Helen Killer here. [laughs]

04:56.208 --> 04:57.732
What? I thought he deserved

04:57.775 --> 04:59.560
a new nickname
now that he'’s blind.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.736
I mean, you have to admit, the
Sinnerman has become a tad old.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.085
Not happening.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.391
Last time you
talked to him,

05:04.434 --> 05:06.088
he gouged
his own eyes out.

05:06.131 --> 05:09.352
Yes, a minor inconvenience,
especially for him.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.919
I mean,
can you imagine living in L.A.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.399
and not being able
to enjoy the sunset?

05:12.442 --> 05:14.096
Yeah, there'’s not much of a view
from prison.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.663
That'’s not the point.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.578
No one'’s talking to him but me.LUCIFER:
What?

05:17.621 --> 05:19.101
You can'’t seriously
be suggesting

05:19.144 --> 05:21.364
that you'’re the impartial party
here.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.105
I mean, he'’s clearly
your Moby Dick,

05:23.148 --> 05:24.715
and we all know
what happened to Captain Ahab.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.239
Felled by savage revenge,

05:27.283 --> 05:29.285
dragged to the bottom
of the sea?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.113
Gosh, did they teach you nothing
at cop school?

05:31.156 --> 05:33.115
I'’ve read Moby Dicksix times.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.117
Oh, really. What
happened on page 83?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.989
CHLOE:
So, what should I call you?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.600
Sinner, is it?
Ah.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.429
Mr. Man?

05:42.472 --> 05:45.127
A census taker once tried
to test me.

05:45.170 --> 05:50.001
Excuse me?I ate his liver with some
fava beans and a nice Chianti.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.613

05:52.656 --> 05:55.311
Ah. No. I'’m-I'm sorry.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.313
Always wanted to do that.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.315
I mean... [scoffs]

05:59.359 --> 06:01.143
Do love that film, though.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.798
Interesting time to make jokes
when two people are dead.

but I know you'’re not crazy.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.504
Nope.

There'’s a definite method
to my non-madness.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.639
Care to elaborate?
No.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.554
No, you'’ll figure it out.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.164
Eventually.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.992
Doesn'’t matter.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.168
We'’ve got enough to put you
away for a long, long time.

Oh, speaking of,

06:27.387 --> 06:28.344

We are not letting the Sinnerman
out of here.

He clearly desires freedom,

he'’s motivated and likely
telling the truth.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.975
Very artistic.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.454
Didn'’t you book Mrs. Baczynski?

09:02.498 --> 09:04.326
Look, I meant to, Chloe,
but I totally spaced

09:04.369 --> 09:05.936
on this random
day off school.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.459
But don'’t worry.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.201
I'’m handling it,
'’cause I'm Super Dad.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.641
ELLA:
Chloe, come look at this.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.599
Wait.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.209
Zoom in.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.825
Got a pretty good idea
where Maggie spends her time.

Thanks. Come on.

they are on the first course--

09:32.746 --> 09:36.619

09:36.663 --> 09:41.493
And their decidedly devious
opponents, the Derby Divas!

09:41.537 --> 09:44.845
They'’re all out there fighting,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.761
So, Derby Divas
versus the Blazing Banshees.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.285
It'’s derby's most
notorious rivalry.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.374

What? So, those
aren'’tladies?

09:57.074 --> 09:59.729
No. Sausage.
It'’s an offensive maneuver.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.688
When Trixie started
roller-skating,

10:01.731 --> 10:05.039
I took her to the derby, and
it was love at first sausage.Ah.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.823
Right, well, as much
as I'’d love a bite,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.782
how about we get
back to proving

10:08.825 --> 10:10.653

Maggie isn'’t as good as mine?

10:22.447 --> 10:23.753
When'’s the last time
you saw her?

10:23.797 --> 10:25.581
Uh, she ditched practice
yesterday,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.583
and she hasn'’t returned
my calls since...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.019
Since what?

10:29.063 --> 10:31.413
Since she got
into one doozy of a booby brawl

Or be a shameful waste of the

how Buttons got out,

against his will?

18:01.558 --> 18:03.343
it wasn'’t about
the hatchback.[sighs]

18:03.386 --> 18:05.040
It wasn'’t. And...

18:06.389 --> 18:07.521
Where could they be?

Okay, assuming we do manage
to swipe the keys

18:22.753 --> 18:25.191
to the holding cell,
how do we get him out of here?

18:25.234 --> 18:27.454
I mean, our sightless scoundrel
doesn'’t exactly blend.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.491
Right. Well...

40:06.534 --> 40:09.015
we'’re both familiar
with the accomplice theory--

40:09.058 --> 40:12.932
that our blind barbarian
had someone working for him.

40:12.975 --> 40:14.760
Yeah.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.326
Right, well, then

40:16.370 --> 40:18.851
it occurred to me that,
what if the Sinnerman

40:18.894 --> 40:21.854
was the one working
for someone else?

40:21.897 --> 40:23.943
What if hewas the accomplice?

40:25.248 --> 40:27.990
Exhibit A.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.124
Here is Mr. Sinnerman
as a child.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.039
With a man

40:33.082 --> 40:35.345
that he seems very close to.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.870
Interesting birthmark.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.828
It'’s a very similar shape
to your military tattoo,

40:39.872 --> 40:41.221
actually, wouldn'’t you agree?

40:41.264 --> 40:43.049
So?

40:43.092 --> 40:44.572
Well, so it stands to reason

40:44.616 --> 40:47.575
that this man would be
very, very old by now.

40:47.619 --> 40:50.143
Or, if he isn'’t,
he'’d have to be...

40:50.186 --> 40:52.232
[chuckling]:
...you know, immortal.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.669
An immortal crime boss.

40:54.713 --> 40:55.801
Just like you'’re the Devil.

40:55.844 --> 40:57.324
[short chuckle]
Yes, I know,

40:57.367 --> 40:59.413
it does sound absurd,
doesn'’t it?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.067
So, as such, there'’s really only

41:01.110 --> 41:04.244
one way to prove my theory.

41:04.287 --> 41:05.854
Where did I...

41:05.898 --> 41:07.813
Ah, there it is.

41:11.686 --> 41:12.905
[grunting]

41:26.875 --> 41:28.790
[sniffs, sighs]

41:58.820 --> 42:00.779
[softly clears throat]

42:00.822 --> 42:02.302
Aah!

42:02.345 --> 42:03.738
[grunting]

42:08.830 --> 42:12.094
I wonder why I didn'’t
figure it out sooner.

42:12.138 --> 42:14.401
"The world'’s first murderer,

42:14.444 --> 42:15.750
"marked by God

42:15.794 --> 42:17.796
"and doomed
to walk the earth alone

42:17.839 --> 42:19.493
for a tortured eternity."

42:19.537 --> 42:21.147
It'’s quite the moniker.

42:21.190 --> 42:23.236
Yet, still,

42:23.279 --> 42:26.021
nowhere near as ridiculous
as the Sinnerman.

42:28.371 --> 42:29.982
[grunts]

42:30.025 --> 42:32.027
Wouldn'’t you agree...

42:32.071 --> 42:33.246
Kane?

42:36.989 --> 42:38.904
[panting]

42:40.688 --> 42:42.603
[sighs]

42:45.084 --> 42:47.390
You may as well
pour me one, too.
