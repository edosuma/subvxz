WEBVTT

00:02.578 --> 00:05.579
Wow, we are getting
a lot of love on Yelp lately.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.582
"Kat's Café makes the best
keto smoothies in town.

00:08.734 --> 00:10.843
"Special shout-out to Randi,
great service,

00:10.994 --> 00:13.012
hot enough to be
a basketball wife."

00:13.163 --> 00:15.072
Yeah. I wrote that.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.499
I got high last night
and posted a bunch of 'em.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.426
I was gonna write that
I could have been a lady
Avenger,

00:19.578 --> 00:21.428
but that just felt
like bragging.

00:21.580 --> 00:24.639
"Three stars. Nice café,
but avoid the lady with glasses

00:24.692 --> 00:27.751
if you're tight on time.
She doesn't know when to stop."

00:27.844 --> 00:30.178
Posted by LadyAvenger.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.015
You know, it's so lame how
people hide behind a keyboard,

00:34.035 --> 00:36.201
but it is something
to think about.

00:37.446 --> 00:39.096
KAT:
Oh, hey, what are you
doing down here?

00:39.114 --> 00:41.856
Getting Martin Scatsese
away from me.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.600
I woke up,
he's staring at me.

00:43.602 --> 00:45.360
Got out of the shower,
he's staring at me.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.273
Danced like nobody's watching,
guess who's staring at me.

00:49.366 --> 00:50.549
He just got fixed yesterday,

00:50.700 --> 00:52.200
so he can't be down here
with the other cats.

00:52.294 --> 00:54.219
He might have
caught something at the vet.

00:54.371 --> 00:56.871
And when you dance, remember
that our window is visible

00:56.965 --> 00:58.223
from the Chipotle
across the street,

00:58.375 --> 01:00.117
so maybe dance
like Garret's watching.

01:00.135 --> 01:03.136
That explains why he's always
giving me free chips.

01:04.381 --> 01:06.473
Are you sure Marty can't stay
down here with you?

01:06.625 --> 01:08.125
Yes, please take him
back up there

01:08.127 --> 01:11.320
and remind him that
BDE comes from within.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.131
-Hello, all.
-KAT: Hello.

01:14.149 --> 01:15.407
-RANDI: Oh, hey, Sheila.
-MAX: Hey, Sheila.

01:15.559 --> 01:17.984
Katharine,
don't you look cute today.

01:18.137 --> 01:20.562
Really?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.063
What do you like?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.658
Well, there's your, um...

01:24.810 --> 01:26.919
Randi, help me out.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.378
How 'bout her shirt?

01:29.498 --> 01:31.256
-She's not gonna buy that.
-(chuckles)

01:31.408 --> 01:32.983
Mother, what do you want?

01:33.152 --> 01:35.577
I've been applying for jobs,
so if anyone calls

01:35.671 --> 01:39.414
and asks about my time
as a flight attendant in 1974,

01:39.491 --> 01:43.251
tell them I'm why they called it
"the friendly skies."

01:43.270 --> 01:45.753
Why are you looking for a job?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.272
Valley Hills
is turning out to be

01:47.499 --> 01:49.424
more expensive than I thought.

01:49.518 --> 01:51.610
Apparently,
the "all you can drink" package

01:51.761 --> 01:53.670
doesn't mean "all I can drink."

01:53.689 --> 01:55.839
Well, that's why
Carter and I like Red Lobster.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.282
"Unlimited Cheddar Bay
Biscuits" means

01:57.509 --> 02:00.160
unlimited Cheddar Bay
Biscuits, bitch.

02:02.364 --> 02:05.198
I'm confused. I thought
you had plenty of money.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.458
Yes, but with inflation,

02:06.610 --> 02:08.518
it makes it harder
to maintain my lifestyle.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.189
My financial advisor says I
should give up my country club.

02:12.207 --> 02:14.449
That's the problem
with your generation.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.377
You kids want everyone
to be as poor as you are.

02:17.529 --> 02:19.621
Well, what kind of job
are you looking for?

02:19.715 --> 02:23.142
I know there are life coaches,
are there life critics?

02:23.369 --> 02:26.311
Well, I'm looking
for something...

02:26.463 --> 02:28.722
entry-level, maybe in retail.

02:28.874 --> 02:30.298
And if it doesn't work out,

02:30.317 --> 02:33.635
I can always sleep with my boss
and make him buy my silence.

02:33.729 --> 02:37.114
The same advice you gave
at my sixth grade career day.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.716
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:39.735 --> 02:42.736
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:42.812 --> 02:45.313
-Mmm, looks good.
-Yeah.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.499
Now, I know you're skeptical
about vegetarianism,

02:47.726 --> 02:49.226
so I have made two sauces,

02:49.319 --> 02:51.670
one with meat and the other
with meat substitute.

02:51.821 --> 02:53.154
See if you can tell

02:53.248 --> 02:54.581
-which one...
-This one. This one has meat.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.400
Bu-But you didn't even
taste the other one...

02:56.493 --> 02:58.735
Don't need to.
This one has meat.

02:58.828 --> 03:00.262
Meat is good.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.425
He's doing it again.

03:05.519 --> 03:09.079
Oh. Give him a break.
He just had surgery.

03:09.097 --> 03:10.672
Imagine if someone
hacked the ornaments

03:10.691 --> 03:12.274
off your Christmas tree.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.268
-Hello.
-MAX: Hey, Sheila.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.178
(groans)
Mother, can you please stop

03:17.272 --> 03:18.680
entering our apartment
without knocking?

03:18.699 --> 03:22.534
We could be doing the,
you know, electric boogaloo.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.871
Until you're mature enough
to use the word "sex,"

03:26.022 --> 03:27.948
you shouldn't be allowed
to do it.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.933
You want to join us?
This sauce has meat.

03:30.102 --> 03:32.711
It's really good.
Because of the meat.

03:32.862 --> 03:34.604
No, I don't want to interrupt.

03:34.606 --> 03:36.298
We can talk after.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.295
Okay, this is freaking me out.

03:42.448 --> 03:44.306
I'm gonna eat in the bedroom.

03:48.787 --> 03:50.044
Seriously, Marty?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.689
Now I can't eat
in my underwear.

03:56.462 --> 03:58.111
(sighs heavily)

03:59.389 --> 04:00.722
What do you want, Mother?

04:00.816 --> 04:04.317
Oh, no, no, please, finish
your trough of simple carbs.

04:04.470 --> 04:07.228
It's fine.
They'll be better cold.

04:07.322 --> 04:11.825
I applied for over a dozen jobs,
didn't even get an interview.

04:11.977 --> 04:14.978
It's a sad day in America
when no one will hire a woman

04:15.071 --> 04:17.905
just because
she's in her late 40s.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.165
(sighs)

04:19.318 --> 04:21.501
Well, maybe your financial
advisor's right.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.078
Maybe it's time
to give up the country club.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.098
It's really just you eating
lunch with other women

04:26.249 --> 04:27.340
whose faces don't move.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.101
Oh, honey,
these are trophy wives.

04:29.252 --> 04:32.329
We're not eating lunch,
we're drinking it.

04:33.089 --> 04:36.090
And that club
is where I met your father.

04:36.184 --> 04:38.110
We got married there.

04:38.854 --> 04:39.927
And now that he's gone,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.948
it's where I feel
closest to him.

04:43.175 --> 04:45.266
I had no idea.

04:45.435 --> 04:46.860
That's so sweet.

04:47.012 --> 04:48.620
I can't believe no one will

04:48.847 --> 04:51.105
even give me a chance.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.441
-(sighs)
-Okay.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.778
I've got an idea,
and it's probably stupid.

04:56.872 --> 05:00.281
MAX:
If it's what I think it is,
it's definitely stupid.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.043
What if you worked at the café?

05:03.137 --> 05:04.878
MAX:
And there it is.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.138
Really?

05:06.456 --> 05:09.641
Hang on a second, let me swallow
this feeling of dread.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.552
Yeah, it could be fun.

05:12.704 --> 05:15.230
MAX:
That's what Lincoln said
about the play.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.634
Ooh.

05:19.711 --> 05:23.363
-It is about to get real.
-(chuckles)

05:26.234 --> 05:28.552
Uh-oh, no condoms.

05:28.570 --> 05:29.719
Are you serious?

05:29.721 --> 05:31.204
Let me check under my Bible.

05:32.649 --> 05:35.667
Oh, come on, Lord,
do me a solid.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.243
Dang it! (scoffs)

05:37.396 --> 05:38.578
You can turned water into wine,

05:38.747 --> 05:41.081
but you can't turn
this ChapStick into a condom?

05:41.900 --> 05:44.067
How are we out?
You love buying 'em.

05:44.127 --> 05:46.236
You even peel the sticker off
and demand they do

05:46.254 --> 05:47.921
a price check over the speaker.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.514
Well, what's the point
of having sex

05:49.666 --> 05:51.741
if you can't let all your
friends at ValuMarket know?

05:51.835 --> 05:54.168
(sighs)
I'm sorry, baby.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.522
I know how much you wanted
all of this.

05:57.749 --> 06:00.600
Why are we still messing
around with condoms, anyway?

06:00.677 --> 06:02.602
Maybe I should just
get back on the pill.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.087
You hated that.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.514
It messed with your hormones,
made you gain weight.

06:06.592 --> 06:09.426
Although that extra junk
was perfectly arranged

06:09.444 --> 06:10.560
in your trunk.

06:11.763 --> 06:14.447
Maybe we should talk about
getting a vasectomy.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.375
Wow, that's a huge step.

06:16.602 --> 06:18.877
Well, I know
I don't want another kid.

06:19.104 --> 06:20.695
I mean, you haven't
changed your mind, have you?

06:20.789 --> 06:22.864
No. I mean, I like kids,

06:22.958 --> 06:24.532
but I'm happy
with the way things are.

06:24.626 --> 06:26.367
Plus, I already
have a child in my life.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.870
Don't call me a child
just because I like cartoons,

06:28.964 --> 06:30.780
water balloon fights,
baby shampoo,

06:30.799 --> 06:32.707
the circus and SpaghettiOs.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.467
I was talking about CJ,

06:34.620 --> 06:37.345
but you do still clap whenever
you see a train going by.

06:37.456 --> 06:38.788
(chuckles) Yeah.

06:38.807 --> 06:40.715
Little man is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.976
It'd just be tough
to do it again at my age.

06:43.128 --> 06:46.571
I mean, I can't learn the slang
of another generation.

06:46.798 --> 06:48.965
I just learned "skrrt!"

06:49.801 --> 06:52.577
So, it sounds like
we're doing the vasectomy.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.320
All right, cool.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.666
Now we just got to figure out
which one of us is gonna get it.

06:59.661 --> 07:01.586
(imitates fanfare)

07:01.738 --> 07:04.330
Sheila Silver, it is my great
honor to bestow upon you

07:04.483 --> 07:06.967
-this Kat's Café apron.
-(sighs heavily)

07:08.095 --> 07:09.819
Wear it in good health,
machine wash cold

07:09.838 --> 07:13.006
and don't try and sell it
on eBay-- it's watermarked.

07:13.158 --> 07:15.492
An apron?

07:15.510 --> 07:17.661
When God gives you
a Lamborghini,

07:17.679 --> 07:19.587
you don't put it under a tarp.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.848
Yes, I like
the way you think, Sheila.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.517
Lady Avenger is gonna love you.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.611
Uh... F-Fine. Fine.

07:26.763 --> 07:29.948
Well, I-I have just declared
today Apron-Free Friday.

07:30.099 --> 07:33.100
-So, thank you both
for complying with my policy.
-(chuckles)

07:34.196 --> 07:36.288
All right, Mother, I have thrown
a lot at you this morning,

07:36.439 --> 07:38.682
but let's have some fun
with the...

07:38.700 --> 07:40.959
Kat's Cat Café employee manual.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.352
I'm not reading that.

07:42.445 --> 07:43.703
Oh, you don't have to read it.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.946
I also recorded it
as an audiobook.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.539
I do all the voices
of the cats.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.541
(Russian accent):
Like a-a famous Russian
Anna Cat-nokova.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.785
She explains sick day policy.

07:51.546 --> 07:52.804
I can't help but feel
you're wildly

07:52.956 --> 07:54.547
overcomplicating this job.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.549
Oh, really?
Oh, so you think it's easy

07:56.702 --> 07:59.627
to make a medium flat white,
half oat milk, half two percent,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.371
with an extra shot
and a Splenda, finished off

08:01.464 --> 08:03.648
with a signature foam cat face?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.709
Gordon Ramsay, if you ever
want to do a show about coffee,

08:05.727 --> 08:08.561
I'm on Fox, you're on Fox,
let's make it happen.

08:09.548 --> 08:11.381
I can make cocktails
in my sleep.

08:11.399 --> 08:13.216
-I think I can handle this.
-(scoffs)

08:13.309 --> 08:14.734
Seriously, I have woken up

08:14.903 --> 08:16.995
with a perfect martini
in my hand.

08:17.222 --> 08:19.389
That's when the doctor
cut off my Ambien.

08:20.149 --> 08:21.983
Hey, I have to duck out
a little early today

08:22.002 --> 08:23.818
to go to the doctor with Carter.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.912
(Russian accent):
Mm, use personal day,
does not count as sick day.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.339
(normal voice):
Is everything okay?

08:27.566 --> 08:29.082
Yeah, it's just a consultation
for a vasectomy.

08:29.158 --> 08:30.542
I just want to be there
so I can see his face

08:30.694 --> 08:33.069
when he finds out
exactly what that is.

08:33.088 --> 08:35.514
Wow, pulling the trigger
on a vasectomy.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.240
Well, I guess not pulling
the trigger so much

08:37.259 --> 08:38.683
-as, like, unloading the gun.
-(chuckles)

08:38.835 --> 08:41.094
Yeah, Carter doesn't really
want to have any more kids.

08:41.263 --> 08:42.579
And what do you want?

08:42.672 --> 08:45.415
Well, I guess I always thought
I would have kids,

08:45.433 --> 08:46.933
but my life just
turned out different,

08:47.085 --> 08:48.918
and Carter and I
have a good thing going.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.195
Good for you.

08:50.346 --> 08:51.604
Children add nothing
to your life

08:51.757 --> 08:54.199
you can't get from
a good magazine subscription.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.261
Mmm. This is really good.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.540
But, uh, the foam art doesn't
look anything like a cat.

09:01.691 --> 09:04.626
That's because
it's a middle finger, boss.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.532
Excuse me,
could I get a straw?

09:11.701 --> 09:12.776
Oh, you don't want one.

09:12.794 --> 09:14.035
They're all paper.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.628
My daughter thinks
she's saving the planet

09:15.781 --> 09:17.947
by ruining
your drinking experience.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.892
Feel good knowing that
you are protecting

09:21.044 --> 09:23.044
the delicate ecosystem
of the ocean.

09:23.212 --> 09:25.972
But she's right-- suck fast,
they turn to mush like that.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.308
What up, Kat?
I grabbed your mail.

09:28.460 --> 09:31.052
If your ValuPak is missing
the Souplantation coupon,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.697
I hear that's been
happening a lot.

09:34.891 --> 09:35.890
Oh, hey.

09:35.984 --> 09:38.026
Postcard from Phil.
Max, your turn.

09:39.062 --> 09:41.580
-Oh, look, they're in Australia.
-(gasps)

09:41.748 --> 09:43.306
(imitating Phil):
"G'day, y'all!"

09:43.325 --> 09:45.232
(normal voice):
"Jalen and I made friends
with the fellas

09:45.252 --> 09:48.978
"from<i> Thunder Down Under,</i>
so we decided to visit.

09:48.997 --> 09:51.405
"Max, we showed 'em
your picture, and you have a job

09:51.425 --> 09:54.241
-if you ever want one."
-(laughter)

09:54.336 --> 09:55.652
Ooh,<i> Thunder Down Under.</i>

09:55.670 --> 09:58.079
I'd like to get a look
at their didgeridoos.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.175
(imitating Phil):
"Tell Sheila their didgeridoos
do not disappoint.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.252
(normal voice):
Send my love
to Carter and Randi."

10:05.272 --> 10:06.754
Aw, I miss Phil.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.774
-He said my name first,
he likes me more.
-(chuckles)

10:10.001 --> 10:11.759
-Did he say anything about me?
-Uh, yeah, take a look.

10:11.853 --> 10:14.112
Oh. Uh, "Kat,
send my last paycheck.

10:14.339 --> 10:15.930
"These boys from down under
don't want to see me

10:16.024 --> 10:18.191
-in the same thong every night."
-(laughs)

10:18.267 --> 10:19.342
Oh, babe, we should get going.

10:19.361 --> 10:20.526
-Oh. Good luck.
-Ooh, yeah.

10:20.695 --> 10:22.028
And after, I was thinking
we can grab dinner

10:22.122 --> 10:23.513
from Souplantation.

10:24.366 --> 10:29.169
Sadly, I do not have a coupon,
so it will cost us full price.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.781
Aw.
Who's this new guy?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.693
Uh, I have no idea,
he's not one of ours.

10:36.695 --> 10:39.304
Oh, I saw him
wandering around out back,

10:39.531 --> 10:40.805
and he looked kind of pathetic,

10:41.032 --> 10:42.866
so I figured he'd fit right in.

10:42.884 --> 10:44.643
Wait, you just found a stray cat

10:44.794 --> 10:46.536
and threw him in with gen pop?

10:46.554 --> 10:48.721
You can't do that.
We have quarantine protocols.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.464
Well, how am I supposed
to know that?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.817
It's page one of the employee
manual, also track one.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.878
Whiskers McGee,
the Irish cat, sings:

10:54.971 --> 10:57.304
♪<i> Don't take in a stray,</i>
<i> until they get a spray</i> ♪

10:57.399 --> 10:59.215
♪<i> They've got bugs and germs</i>
<i> and sometimes worms</i> ♪

10:59.234 --> 11:02.035
♪<i> So give it</i>
<i> three or four days, meow.</i> ♪

11:04.164 --> 11:07.724
Oh, man. They should have these
at Souplantation.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.334
Boom, got my turkey chili.

11:09.561 --> 11:12.078
Boom, hitting
the garlic bread station.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.747
Boom, back at the table.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.675
And then boom, eating alone.

11:18.161 --> 11:21.662
Hello, Carter, Randi.
Good to see you again.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.089
Hi, Dr. Colman.

11:23.241 --> 11:25.499
Uh, can you tell him
what a vasectomy is

11:25.519 --> 11:26.592
and who has to get it?

11:26.745 --> 11:27.593
Wait, hold on.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.670
All right, we good.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.414
Well, actually,

11:31.433 --> 11:33.191
before I refer you
to a urologist,

11:33.342 --> 11:34.567
I'd recommend one more test.

11:34.677 --> 11:37.420
-Okay, here comes the upselling.
-Mm-hmm.

11:37.439 --> 11:38.863
You are worse than my weed guy.

11:39.015 --> 11:42.367
If it's half-off, neither
one of us wants it, Reggie.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.370
No, I noticed your father
had colon cancer

11:45.597 --> 11:47.263
and your blood work
came back with some things

11:47.356 --> 11:48.540
that I want to follow up on.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.542
Oh, Lord, is this how I go?

11:50.693 --> 11:52.435
I'm too young to die!

11:52.454 --> 11:54.454
Randi, you better not
fall in love again.

11:54.622 --> 11:56.105
I don't want that for you.

11:56.199 --> 11:58.550
Okay, relax,
you're not gonna die.

11:58.626 --> 12:01.386
Oh, I swear to God,
I will haunt your fine ass.

12:01.613 --> 12:04.447
Doctor, what's going on?
Is it serious?

12:04.466 --> 12:06.040
We just want to be
on the safe side.

12:06.134 --> 12:08.375
I'm referring you to Dr. Monroe
for a colonoscopy.

12:08.453 --> 12:09.635
Aw, hell no.

12:09.804 --> 12:11.429
I don't even like getting
my regular picture taken.

12:11.656 --> 12:13.639
I understand your concern,
but this is a simple,

12:13.734 --> 12:15.066
outpatient procedure.

12:15.218 --> 12:18.385
And I'm sure Reggie
can help with your recovery.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.963
Easy for you to say.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.056
You're not the one getting the
camera shoved down his throat.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.650
-Actually the camera goes...
-No, no, no.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.203
Don't ruin the surprise.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.232
Excuse me, I've been waiting
20 minutes

12:31.251 --> 12:32.642
for a vanilla latte.

12:32.735 --> 12:33.826
Right, sorry.
I'm not ignoring you.

12:33.979 --> 12:35.086
You are
a very valuable customer.

12:35.238 --> 12:37.480
I just, I completely forgot
all about you.

12:37.573 --> 12:39.591
Hey, you feel like
Mexican for dinner?

12:39.742 --> 12:42.001
I think I can twerk my way
into a family pack.

12:42.153 --> 12:44.654
Um, I'd really rather
you clean some tables,

12:44.656 --> 12:46.672
maybe change the litter,
and I have seen you twerk,

12:46.767 --> 12:49.175
-it's, like, worth maybe
a veggie taco at best.
-(scoffs)

12:49.269 --> 12:50.584
Well, where's Sheila and Randi?

12:50.678 --> 12:53.679
Uh, Randi's with Carter
and my mother is MIA.

12:53.832 --> 12:56.090
Fine.
But for the record,

12:56.184 --> 12:59.527
my milkshake brings
all the girls to the yard.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.615
Ooh, I'm just in time.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.024
Mother, where have you been?

13:05.176 --> 13:06.600
You left for lunch
over two hours ago.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.362
I was working.
Your coffee vendor, Arturo,

13:09.514 --> 13:10.955
came in earlier
and I took him to lunch,

13:11.107 --> 13:13.958
lunch turned into drinks,
and drinks turned into

13:14.110 --> 13:16.110
he's taking me salsa dancing
next weekend.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.521
Uh, how is that "working?"

13:18.614 --> 13:20.690
It's called the art
of the schmooze, darling.

13:20.708 --> 13:24.469
If I tickle his beans,
you'll get a discount on yours.

13:24.696 --> 13:27.472
I did not hire you
to date the coffee vendor.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.140
How much of a discount?

13:29.367 --> 13:30.533
Where do you want these?

13:30.552 --> 13:31.976
Um, you can just put 'em...
Uh, wait...

13:32.203 --> 13:33.961
Why are you itch...
Why am I itching?

13:34.055 --> 13:35.705
BRANDI:
Oh, my God, is that a flea?

13:35.798 --> 13:36.889
KAT:
A flea?!

13:37.042 --> 13:39.300
W-We don't have fleas, Brandi.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.985
'Cause if we had fleas
I'd be itching

13:41.137 --> 13:42.895
my leg and my arm
and the back of my neck,

13:43.048 --> 13:45.990
but look, it's...
I'm fine. Nothing.

13:49.237 --> 13:50.662
And then there's your latte.
There you go.

13:50.813 --> 13:53.239
It's on the house.
(laughs)

13:53.333 --> 13:54.165
Oh, God.

13:54.317 --> 13:55.533
How are you not itching?

13:55.760 --> 13:59.212
Between the gin and the Botox,
I can't feel a thing.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.919
Look at this. I was reading
this article. It says

14:07.072 --> 14:08.346
one of the signs of colon cancer

14:08.423 --> 14:10.998
is passing
excessive amounts of gas.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.242
I think I had this
since I was a kid.

14:13.336 --> 14:15.186
Okay, you got to stay off WebMD.

14:15.413 --> 14:17.171
This is like the time
you had a cyst on your shoulder

14:17.190 --> 14:19.916
and convinced yourself
you were growing a second head.

14:20.009 --> 14:22.268
Yeah, but when it popped,
I felt like I lost a brother.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.770
Carter Two never
got to see the ocean.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.731
You're worrying about bad news

14:26.883 --> 14:28.274
that you're probably
never gonna get.

14:28.426 --> 14:30.109
Yeah, but you don't
know that, Randi.

14:30.261 --> 14:31.870
I mean, it runs in my family,

14:31.946 --> 14:35.189
like great hair and a smile that
makes people want to hug me.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.024
Just because something
runs in your family

14:37.043 --> 14:38.543
doesn't mean
you're gonna get it, too.

14:38.694 --> 14:41.604
I mean, look at my sister--
she ugly and I'm hot.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.956
I just can't stop
thinking about my dad

14:44.109 --> 14:45.216
and everything
that he went through.

14:45.326 --> 14:47.719
I can't get sick, Randi.

14:47.870 --> 14:49.779
I got too much I want to do.

14:49.797 --> 14:51.890
Teach CJ how to drive.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.391
Dance with you at our wedding.

14:53.618 --> 14:56.285
We're supposed to grow old
with each other.

14:56.379 --> 14:59.455
And we will because
they're not gonna find anything.

14:59.515 --> 15:00.899
And if they do,
we're gonna deal with it

15:01.126 --> 15:04.310
like we deal with
everything else: together.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.129
Yeah, I guess.

15:06.147 --> 15:07.688
No, look at me.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.407
I love you.

15:09.634 --> 15:12.468
And I'm gonna take care of you
no matter what.

15:12.487 --> 15:14.162
Thank you, baby.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.063
Uh-oh.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.081
What's going on?

15:17.233 --> 15:18.491
Laxative's kicking in.

15:18.643 --> 15:22.128
Hey phone, play ocean sounds
really loud.

15:27.410 --> 15:30.002
Do we really have to do all of
this just 'cause of some fleas?

15:30.155 --> 15:32.764
Yes, we have
a very strict protocol.

15:32.915 --> 15:34.933
This is a Code Meow.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.917
We're gonna
disinfect everything,

15:37.086 --> 15:38.585
deflea and isolate
Kitten Kaboodle--

15:38.605 --> 15:40.830
that's right, I named him.

15:40.848 --> 15:43.349
Do we have any more garbage bags
for these pillows?

15:43.501 --> 15:45.184
Oh, no, those are fine,
I already vacuumed them.

15:45.336 --> 15:48.721
Oh, this is not flea-related.
They're just ugly.

15:48.873 --> 15:53.509
So far, I have found a dozen
fleas and a cigarette butt.

15:53.602 --> 15:56.362
This cat has seen some things.

15:56.514 --> 15:58.848
Don't blame K.K.
for all of this.

15:58.866 --> 16:00.983
It's not his fault.
Is it, Mother?

16:01.035 --> 16:03.461
Mm.
I'd say the fault lies with

16:03.538 --> 16:05.946
whoever had the brilliant idea
to combine a café

16:05.966 --> 16:08.524
with America's
least favorite pet.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.969
(laughs) Mm-mmm.

16:11.863 --> 16:14.547
For your information,
there are 58 million pet cats

16:14.716 --> 16:17.291
in America, and that number
is probably underreported

16:17.418 --> 16:19.702
because some very normal ladies
are ashamed to admit

16:19.795 --> 16:20.886
how many they have.

16:21.039 --> 16:22.205
That's a good point.

16:22.373 --> 16:24.798
Sometimes I'm ashamed to admit
I have a daughter.

16:24.892 --> 16:26.133
Oh, yeah?

16:26.302 --> 16:28.894
Dad said Marci Connor's boobs
were nicer than yours.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.397
All right,
let's-let's all calm down.

16:31.549 --> 16:33.992
-Let's take a deep breath...
-No!

16:34.143 --> 16:35.568
I've had it up to here
with your attitude.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.644
Ever since I hired you,
you've been undermining me

16:37.664 --> 16:39.313
and insulting me nonstop.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.149
I thought that was our thing.

16:42.243 --> 16:43.559
What am I not getting?

16:43.578 --> 16:45.561
What you're not getting
is that when you're here

16:45.580 --> 16:48.006
I'm not just your daughter,
I'm your boss.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.399
I would appreciate you
treating me with respect.

16:50.418 --> 16:51.509
I'll treat you with respect

16:51.660 --> 16:53.011
when you've done something
to earn it.

16:53.238 --> 16:55.996
You know I hired you
as a favor, right?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.682
How am I supposed
to take you seriously?

16:57.851 --> 17:00.259
You're literally
dressed as garbage.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.669
Okay, that does it.
You're fired.

17:02.764 --> 17:04.838
-What?
-That's right!

17:04.932 --> 17:06.265
And no exit interview.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.084
You'll never know
what pluses and minuses

17:08.177 --> 17:10.194
you brought to this team.

17:15.610 --> 17:17.610
What are you looking at?
You're next.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.111
I don't even work here.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.205
That's it! You're gone!

17:24.693 --> 17:26.527
Carter.

17:26.621 --> 17:28.379
Baby, wake up.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.625
We only have 15 more minutes
left on free parking.

17:32.777 --> 17:35.035
If you don't get up,
it's gonna be four dollars.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.889
-Oh. I'm up. I'm up.
-(chuckles)

17:38.116 --> 17:40.116
Well, I have good news for you.

17:40.209 --> 17:41.559
The doctor didn't find anything.

17:41.710 --> 17:43.603
Oh. So, no cancer?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.305
(sighs) Thank God.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.232
Yep, you have
a clean bill of health.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.735
So looks like I'm stuck
with you forever. (laughs)

17:50.962 --> 17:53.571
You're so good to me.

17:53.722 --> 17:54.980
I don't deserve you.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.316
Oh, so the anesthesia
is wearing off.

17:57.468 --> 17:59.635
You're thinking straight.

17:59.654 --> 18:01.913
I never met anyone like you.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.623
Aw.

18:04.733 --> 18:07.293
Maybe this is
gonna sound crazy...

18:08.588 --> 18:11.297
What would you think
if we did start a family?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.740
What?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.334
I thought you didn't want to.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.411
I know.

18:17.505 --> 18:21.415
But after
going through all this,

18:21.434 --> 18:25.561
seeing how sweet,
caring and loving you are...

18:27.089 --> 18:30.608
...it made me think
how lucky a kid would be

18:30.759 --> 18:32.985
to get to call you Mom.

18:33.688 --> 18:35.171
Carter.

18:35.264 --> 18:38.116
But only if you want to.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.119
Okay.

18:41.270 --> 18:42.769
We'll talk about it.

18:42.864 --> 18:44.122
Great.

18:44.349 --> 18:45.939
So, postpone the vasectomy?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.183
Aw, damn, too late.

18:47.201 --> 18:49.018
I told them to do it
while you were under.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.203
What?
But we didn't agree

18:51.297 --> 18:53.214
which one of us
was gonna get it!

19:02.791 --> 19:04.142
What are you doing?

19:04.369 --> 19:05.384
I'm working.

19:05.553 --> 19:07.219
The cats are fed,
the pastries are stocked,

19:07.296 --> 19:09.555
and Arturo
is one tasteful nude away

19:09.707 --> 19:12.299
from giving you ten percent off
your next coffee order.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.727
Uh, I'm pretty sure I fired you,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.046
and based on the number of times
that I listened to

19:17.139 --> 19:18.381
"Boss Bitch" afterwards,

19:18.399 --> 19:20.324
I was feeling
really good about it.

19:20.476 --> 19:21.676
After I went home,

19:21.678 --> 19:24.645
I got a call from
one of the jobs I applied for.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.481
They asked me
what kind of employee I was.

19:27.575 --> 19:30.317
I said I was reliable, punctual,

19:30.336 --> 19:32.411
a team player, hardworking.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.672
Were you applying
for a job at the firm of

19:34.841 --> 19:37.466
Liar, Liar and Pants on Fire?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.493
That's just it.

19:39.587 --> 19:41.345
When I was younger,
I was all those things.

19:41.497 --> 19:43.205
I mean, I was a working woman

19:43.257 --> 19:45.999
in a time when it was very hard
to be taken seriously.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.501
And I took pride
in showing the world

19:47.670 --> 19:50.837
that pretty girls
could contribute, too.

19:50.932 --> 19:54.007
I was just as good
as any of those uggos.

19:54.101 --> 19:57.420
Yeah, life certainly is stacked
against the beautiful.

19:57.588 --> 19:58.604
Thank you.

19:58.756 --> 20:00.439
But the point is

20:00.591 --> 20:05.094
I realized I hadn't been
that kind of employee for you.

20:05.263 --> 20:08.080
And that made me feel...

20:10.935 --> 20:11.934
Guilty?

20:12.027 --> 20:15.880
Ah, I'm not sure.
This is all so new.

20:17.366 --> 20:21.126
You did do me a favor, and
I didn't treat you very well.

20:21.796 --> 20:25.205
You started this cat café

20:25.299 --> 20:26.949
and made it last three years,

20:26.951 --> 20:30.786
which seems both impossible

20:30.805 --> 20:33.380
and worthy of my respect.

20:33.474 --> 20:35.650
I'm proud of you.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.794
Thank you.

20:38.813 --> 20:42.114
You're not just my daughter,
you're a business owner.

20:43.058 --> 20:45.985
And, dare I say it,

20:46.153 --> 20:48.329
a boss bitch.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.500
Well, in that case...

20:55.088 --> 20:56.495
Welcome back.

20:56.647 --> 20:59.148
I already called you
a boss bitch.

20:59.166 --> 21:01.333
Don't make me
call you a bitch, boss.
