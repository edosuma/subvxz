00:05.839 --> 00:08.342
<i>- Well, what do you want?
- l don't care. Whatever you want.</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.135
<i>- You don't care?
- l didn't mean that.</i>

00:10.385 --> 00:12.763
<i>- l'm not that picky.
- How come l always have the ideas?</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:15.516
Why don't you make that thing
you made the first night?

00:15.682 --> 00:19.436
<i>- What was that thing l made?
- lt had a green sauce, right?</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:22.064
<i>- You don't even know, do you?
- Do we have to do this now?</i>

00:22.231 --> 00:24.399
<i>- You never remember anything.
- lt's our anniversary.</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:27.152
<i>You never listen to me,
you bastard.</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:30.656
<i>Jerry.</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:32.991
<i>Jerry.</i>

01:24.501 --> 01:25.919
- Finish that database?
- Yesterday.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.923
Then it should have been
on my desk yesterday.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.759
l didn't realise a compilation
of nudie bars was that urgent.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.094
Well, it is.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.890
- Why?
- l don't have to explain myself.

01:38.098 --> 01:42.144
- Okay, is this work-related, because--?
- But l will just this once.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.396
lt's a mercy mission, probie.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.981
A buddy of mine is getting married

01:46.148 --> 01:47.983
to a particularly unpleasant
beast of a woman.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.194
- So?
- So?

01:50.402 --> 01:52.696
So the memory
of his bachelor party

01:52.905 --> 01:54.489
will be the only thing
that sustains him

01:54.656 --> 01:56.658
through the rest
of his miserable existence.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.911
l'll print it out
as soon as l'm finished with this.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.163
On behalf of men everywhere,
we thank you, probie.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.414
What are you working on?

02:02.581 --> 02:04.458
l'm reviewing
my credit card statement.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.335
There appears
to be some anomalies.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.961
<i>Fifty DVD copies
of Forrest Hump?</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:11.340
<i>Yeah, see, l don't even know
what a Forrest Hump is.</i>

02:11.590 --> 02:14.134
<i>Well, it's like Forrest Gump
with naked people, probie.</i>

02:14.343 --> 02:16.303
- What?
- lt's a porno

02:16.803 --> 02:18.180
or so l've been told.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.642
This is obviously an error
with the credit card company.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.644
Or it's identity theft.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.145
No. lt's not possible.

02:25.312 --> 02:29.024
l use a secure browser
and the latest firewall protection.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.152
Look at that, a $5,000 charge
from John Deere.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.613
A down payment on that combine
you've always dreamed of.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.490
Put the farm equipment on hold.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.867
A sailor was shot on Route 249.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.620
Tony, grab the gear. Green Acres.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.039
Gas the truck.
Where the hell is David?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.626
- Boss, Officer David is--
- Late.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.253
l took the wrong bus this morning.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.255
Had to walk
from the 1 8th Street stop.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.631
That's a tough part of town.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.884
l've been in worse.
Won't happen again, Gibbs.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.261
l know.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.815
Special Agent Gibbs?

03:10.023 --> 03:14.570
No, he's the older gentleman
with the smile on his face.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.328
Agent Gibbs,
car's in the crevice at the bottom.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.581
The victim's dead inside.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.541
Lieutenant Hampton,
Virginia State Police.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.418
The last few yards are pretty steep.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.212
One of the EMTs managed
to make it all the way down.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.549
The fire department's bringing special
equipment to extricate the body.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.800
lt's gonna take a while.

03:37.009 --> 03:40.512
McGee. Sketch. Get close enough
without breaking your neck.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.098
- On it.
- DiNozzo, photos.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.766
ls there a problem?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.560
You didn't say anything
about my neck.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.396
But l'll be careful.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.441
What about me?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.944
- Who called it in?
- His wife.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.071
She was on the phone with him
when it happened.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.449
Officer David, take her statement.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.576
l should warn you
l'm not very good with women.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.912
That'll make two things
you're not very good at today.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.247
- And the first?
- Being on time.

04:07.456 --> 04:11.585
- l'm sorry for the delay, Jethro.
- Traffic, it was murder.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.629
Sorry, poor choice of words there.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.255
See what you can get, Duck.

04:15.464 --> 04:18.716
- He's trapped in there pretty good.
- Oh, we'll do our best.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.762
l hope you brought more
appropriate footwear, Mr. Palmer.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.098
The journey to our petty officer
looks rather challenging.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.643
Don't worry, doctor.
l have a merit badge in hiking.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.978
l have a driver's licence, Mr. Palmer.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.982
lt doesn't mean l turn up
at lndianapolis in my Morgan.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.818
You were on the phone with him
when he was shot?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.906
He couldn't remember pesto
and it pissed me off.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.409
How stupid is that?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.749
Could you tell me how many shots?

04:53.752 --> 04:56.004
Do you know what the last words
l said to him were?

04:58.257 --> 05:01.093
l called him a bastard.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.514
And l can't take it back.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.391
Not now, l can't.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.280
lf it's any consolation, probie,
l had my identity stolen once.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.699
- Really?
- l had a charge on my Visa

05:23.866 --> 05:26.368
for a vintage Barbie doll.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.036
Career Girl outfit.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.332
With the matching briefcase
and pumps?

05:35.460 --> 05:40.674
l had a girlfriend who collected once.
We used to line them up on the--

05:40.883 --> 05:43.385
l lost respect for you
at the word ''pumps.''

05:44.011 --> 05:45.220
Get back to work.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.556
lt's kind of hard to sketch
from this distance.

05:47.723 --> 05:50.142
Don't get any closer.
lt gets steeper as it gets deeper.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.727
One false move and--

05:53.478 --> 05:54.938
Look out.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.985
Good hustle, Palmer.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.989
No skid marks. He didn't attempt
to control the car before it went over.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.951
They were having an argument
over a six-month anniversary.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.537
l don't understand the half-year thing.
l thought perhaps--

06:10.704 --> 06:13.248
l don't understand anniversaries,
period.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.000
Apparently, neither did her husband.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.711
She was screaming at him
when she heard a loud gunshot

06:17.878 --> 06:19.171
followed by the crash.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.423
- What else?
- She could hear a low moan

06:21.590 --> 06:23.926
for a few minutes after impact.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.262
Oh, yeah. l think it's sprained, guys.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.765
Oh, Dr. Mallard's gonna be upset,
isn't he?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.391
Wouldn't worry about him.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.603
But if Gibbs sees you wearing loafers
at a crime scene...

06:35.187 --> 06:36.688
He'll pretty much kill you dead.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.747
They were having
a little trouble with the help.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.707
Nothing for you to worry about.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.751
lt's gonna take more time
than usual,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.879
but we're gonna get you out of there,
l promise.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.474
ls anybody gonna join me
down here?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.434
Well, Gibbs said not to get too close.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.771
Yeah, you really shouldn't be
down there, Ducky. lt's not safe.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.232
The exit wound
to the petty officer's neck

07:20.440 --> 07:23.443
seems to indicate
the bullet went straight through.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.320
There could be a spent round

07:25.571 --> 07:28.740
that might be crucial
to our investigation.

07:29.992 --> 07:34.079
Well, as you've pointed out many
times, l'm just a junior field agent.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.415
All the more reason
you need the experience, probie.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.586
How about l follow in your footsteps?
You lead the way.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.547
How about you kiss
my experienced buttocks?

07:43.755 --> 07:47.176
Am l gonna have to call Jethro
on this one, gentlemen?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.552
No, we're good.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.846
The chances of finding
that bullet are--

07:51.054 --> 07:52.639
One in a million.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.141
You've got to see this, Gibbs.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.351
The grooves made that pattern.

07:56.602 --> 08:01.607
lt's the exact same design as the cover
of Classic Death's second CD.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.359
Don't tell me you don't know
Classic Death,

08:04.526 --> 08:06.862
- because it's my favourite--
- Not now, Abby.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.363
But it could be a sign, Gibbs.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.949
Like that tortilla skillet
with the image of Jesus in it.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.328
- They thought that was a miracle.
- lt'll be a miracle if you still have a job

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
if you don't get back on topic.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.332
l see your point, O Great One.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.710
This is me getting back on topic.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.296
Nine millimetre, 1 20 grain.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.173
The window was rolled up
when he was shot.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.050
- Glass?
- There's traces in the rifling.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.843
- Manufacturer?
- Can't tell.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.554
l'm gonna plug this
into the FBl's Drugfire database

08:32.721 --> 08:35.474
- and see if l get a match, but--
- But it's gonna take a while.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.518
See? Mind reading.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.354
There may be something supernatural
going on here.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.563
Let me know
when you have something.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.193
l bet l could sell this on eBay.
Did you know they got 28 grand

08:46.401 --> 08:49.530
for the grilled cheese sandwich with
the image of the Virgin Mary on it?

08:51.615 --> 08:52.908
Gibbs?

08:53.158 --> 08:55.869
Preliminary trajectory shows
that the bullet passed straight

08:56.036 --> 08:57.412
through the driver's side window.

08:57.621 --> 09:01.667
So l recommend we search the area
along this path looking for spent brass.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.043
You won't find it.

09:03.252 --> 09:07.214
Nine-millimetre rounds are slow
and only accurate to about 30 metres.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.009
The shooter was in a moving car
that pulled up alongside.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.680
Yeah, that is one possibility, Ziva.
But, you see,

09:14.888 --> 09:18.350
we're investigators, which means we
investigate things, we don't assume.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.230
She's right. Wife said she heard
the gunshot over the phone.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.148
- The shooter had to be close.
- Thank you.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.733
What about Petty Officer Smith?

09:26.942 --> 09:29.903
l ran his military lD.
He was a clerk at Norfolk.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.905
Had four months left
before his discharge.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.449
Tony, take Ziva with you
and check with the C.O.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.910
When you're done,
sweep the trajectory for brass.

09:37.119 --> 09:41.665
- But why? You just said l--
- Because DiNozzo's right too.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.046
All of these people
are in the military?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.090
Yeah, the uniforms
are kind of a dead giveaway.

09:50.299 --> 09:51.967
Then why aren't they armed?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.886
Because we're in America,

09:54.386 --> 09:56.471
and the machine guns
would just get in the way.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.432
All right. Okay.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.061
- Commander.
- What can l do for NClS today?

10:03.270 --> 10:06.481
Sorry to have to tell you this but one
of your men was killed this morning.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.775
My God, who?

10:08.984 --> 10:11.570
- Petty Officer Jerry Smith.
- Smith?

10:11.778 --> 10:14.281
He was shot on Route 249
on his way into work.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.492
l think you have my man confused
with someone else.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.121
That's Petty Officer Jerry Smith
right over there.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.928
Why would anyone
want to impersonate me?

10:36.136 --> 10:39.723
Let's see. Blackmail, espionage,
terrorism, potential assassination.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.475
l'm just-- l'm just a clerk, ma'am.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.685
l don't even have
a security clearance or anything.

10:43.894 --> 10:47.147
- What kind of a clerk?
- l'm in a supply unit. l'm an SK2.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.650
l'm new to NClS, petty officer.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.527
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.364
Well, well--
Basically, l'm just a storekeeper.

10:56.490 --> 11:02.329
Like today, l filled requests for tp,
liquid soap, toilet seat covers.

11:02.538 --> 11:06.625
We call it ''Getting a Head Day.''

11:07.376 --> 11:09.878
Because in the Navy,
the head is another word--

11:10.087 --> 11:11.797
For the toilet. Yes, l know.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.132
This has something to do
with your personal life?

11:14.341 --> 11:17.719
Well, probably not.
l don't really have one.

11:17.928 --> 11:22.808
l mean, most nights l just go home
and surf the web or watch reality TV.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.561
<i>Really into Survivor. Average Joe.</i>

11:25.769 --> 11:29.189
<i>The Amazing Race is cool.
l like Extreme Makeover, but--</i>

11:29.398 --> 11:31.650
- l don't own a TV.
- Really?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.819
l don't think l've ever
met anyone who didn't--

11:33.986 --> 11:36.780
What does your wife think
about all this nightly stimulation?

11:36.989 --> 11:39.491
l don't have a wife.
No girlfriend either.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.996
l just don't really seem to do very well
in that department.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.414
lt's just me and Max.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.749
- Max is your boyfriend?
- No. No.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.419
Jeez,
l'm like as straight as they come.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.005
- Max is a marmoset.
- A monkey.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.882
A pet. Nothing more.

11:55.090 --> 11:58.552
That's reassuring, petty officer.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.680
A buddy of mine was shipping out.
He was in a bit of a bind.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.642
l said no way, but when l got
one look at the little guy...

12:07.436 --> 12:09.313
He's just so damn cute, ma'am.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.692
Petty Officer Smith
was transferred from Pearl

12:13.859 --> 12:15.694
about the same time l was,
Agent DiNozzo.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.946
- You serve with him there?
- Different units.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.907
We never crossed paths
until this command.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.410
- What kind of a sailor is he?
- Officially, he's never missed work.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.786
He's always on time.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.707
l'm more interested in unofficially,
commander.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.835
lt's not in my nature
to be disparaging.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.591
Well, l've got a body
lying on a slab back at NClS.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.594
So by all means, disparage away.

12:43.889 --> 12:47.809
l guess you could say Petty Officer
Smith is not the brightest sailor

12:47.976 --> 12:49.186
that l've ever commanded.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.567
Now that l say it out loud, the thought
occurs to me that could be the reason

12:55.734 --> 12:59.029
someone found it so easy
to steal his identity.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.114
Can you think of any reason

13:01.281 --> 13:03.200
why someone
would want to impersonate him?

13:03.408 --> 13:07.329
God, no, Agent DiNozzo. God, no.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.628
More porno?

13:15.587 --> 13:17.339
What do we have, McGee?

13:18.757 --> 13:21.301
Three more charges
since yesterday.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.972
Sorry. Sorry, boss.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.141
Cell phone records
are downloading now.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.561
Okay, it looks like
Petty Officer Smith--

13:30.769 --> 13:33.397
Officer Smith in the car,
not the one on base who's the real--

13:33.605 --> 13:34.773
Yeah, l got it, McGee.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.901
Well, he was definitely talking
to Mrs. Smith, if that is her real name.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.611
McGee.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.323
He was talking to her
at their home from his cell

13:43.490 --> 13:46.785
just before she called in the accident.
l've got an address here.

13:47.452 --> 13:50.038
lt's an apartment in Newport News.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.125
- Lease is in the wife's name.
- Ziva, you're with me.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.795
Possibly a point man for an operational
reconnaissance of the naval base.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.339
- l--
- That means you go with him.

14:00.257 --> 14:03.260
- Now.
- Before the elevator doors close.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.322
You just hung up
on Director Shepard.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.202
ln my country, the officer in charge
is always treated with--

14:28.368 --> 14:30.662
ln my country, on my team,
working my cases,

14:30.829 --> 14:33.457
my people don't bypass
the chain of command.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.042
- Which is?
- Me.

14:35.626 --> 14:39.129
Are we clear on that, Officer David?

14:39.379 --> 14:43.133
Crystal, Agent Gibbs.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.147
Except she called me.
What would you have me do?

14:57.940 --> 15:03.487
Smile. Talk about the weather.
Tell her to call me.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.155
And if that doesn't work?

15:05.364 --> 15:08.325
You're a smart girl.
Think of something.

15:12.579 --> 15:17.042
- l am merely trying to do my job.
- Your job is to follow my instructions.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.671
And l respect that. ls it too much
to ask for some in return?

15:28.262 --> 15:29.930
No. lt's not.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.268
So that's it?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.563
Don't l even get a slap on the head?

15:37.771 --> 15:38.856
Don't push it.

15:40.858 --> 15:44.778
Just to be clear, are there any more
of these rules l should be aware of?

15:44.987 --> 15:46.154
About 50 of them.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.992
And l don't suppose
they're written down

15:50.158 --> 15:52.161
- anywhere that l could--
- No.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.415
- Then how am l supposed to--?
- My job is to teach them to you.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.138
No picture of your husband
in uniform?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.682
Jerry hated the Navy.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.935
He only joined for the money
they'd give him for college.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.729
But he couldn't wait to get out.

16:18.937 --> 16:22.441
l was so mean to him on the phone.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.277
lt was our half anniversary.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.239
We know. A very special occasion.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.533
Why can't men understand that?

16:31.992 --> 16:34.244
Your husband talk
about his work much, Mrs. Smith?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.288
Never.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.709
He wouldn't even let me visit him
on base or even call him there.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.503
You never saw him at his work?

16:44.213 --> 16:45.797
You never dropped him off?

16:48.258 --> 16:50.177
l told you he hated the Navy.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.305
Every morning, he'd put on his uniform
and go to the office.

16:53.472 --> 16:57.601
Soon as he got home,
couldn't get out of it fast enough.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.104
You didn't know Jerry long
before you married, did you?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.148
Only three months.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.361
l know. lt was crazy.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.656
lt just felt right, you know?

17:10.864 --> 17:16.118
Jerry was the first truly decent man
l had ever met.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.752
What's going on here?

17:24.837 --> 17:26.588
This is Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.926
He's been working at Norfolk
for about four months.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.011
His commanding officer
confirmed it.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.138
He look familiar?

17:35.347 --> 17:37.057
l don't know this man.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.185
l don't understand.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.437
Neither do we.

17:43.355 --> 17:47.109
Discolouration
indicates blunt-force trauma.

17:47.276 --> 17:52.030
Yes, these abdominal bruises here
in this area

17:52.239 --> 17:55.659
are consistent with the door frame
crushing against his body.

17:55.868 --> 17:58.954
You think Epsom salt
reduces swelling faster?

17:59.121 --> 18:03.333
Mr. Palmer, l'm sure our mystery guest
would appreciate it

18:03.500 --> 18:05.544
if you could concentrate
all your efforts

18:05.711 --> 18:08.630
on helping me to discover
the cause of his demise

18:08.797 --> 18:13.051
rather than obsessing on how
you will look in shorts this weekend.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.636
- Sorry, doctor.
- Actually,

18:14.845 --> 18:19.224
l found the ladies tend to be
sympathetic towards visible injury.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.518
- Really?
- Yes. My first year in college,

18:21.727 --> 18:24.938
l suffered an unfortunate injury
to my testicles.

18:26.273 --> 18:32.446
The excruciating pain was offset
by an impressive swelling

18:32.613 --> 18:35.908
which Ramona Kincaid--

18:36.283 --> 18:37.701
Bless her heart.

18:37.910 --> 18:42.456
--found extremely fascinating.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.797
Yeah.

18:55.135 --> 19:00.265
Now, the bullet wound to the neck
evaded the anterior triangle,

19:00.474 --> 19:03.519
thus missing both
the carotid artery and jugular vein.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.187
Most of the damage was muscular.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.941
lt also grazed
the oesophagus and thyroid.

19:09.149 --> 19:14.780
Oh, dear. Severe damage
to the liver, pancreas, spleen.

19:14.947 --> 19:20.869
Oh, and there's a nasty tear to the left
ventricle caused by a bruised rib.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.580
Cause of death
is from the trauma of the crash.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.834
You just earned yourself
another merit badge, Mr. Palmer.

19:28.043 --> 19:31.463
He was alive for several minutes
after he was shot.

19:31.672 --> 19:35.300
Sorry to have to say it, my poor fellow,
but you'd have been better off

19:35.467 --> 19:39.304
if your assassin had been
a more precise marksman.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.992
This case reminds me of something
my father used to tell me as a child.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.037
''Really, Ziva? What was that?''

20:08.208 --> 20:09.501
He would say that no one

20:09.710 --> 20:13.505
could ever truly know another person
or their secrets.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.634
l, of course, refused to believe him.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.347
''And now, Ziva?''

20:22.890 --> 20:25.017
As an adult,

20:26.935 --> 20:29.897
l believe he was never
more honest with me.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.275
What do you believe, Gibbs?

20:34.651 --> 20:38.655
l think l really got to get the radio
in this car fixed.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.036
<i>- Yeah, Abby?
- l've got a match</i>

20:44.244 --> 20:45.829
on the dead guy's prints, Gibbs.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.790
<i>- From the AFlS database.
- He's in the military?</i>

20:48.999 --> 20:51.376
<i>- Anchors aweigh, Gibbs-o.
- Who?</i>

20:51.919 --> 20:53.420
You're not gonna believe it.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.005
<i>- Try me.
- You're not.</i>

20:55.214 --> 20:59.301
- Who the hell is he, Abs?
- Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.304
He actually
is Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

21:02.513 --> 21:05.807
He's stationed at the Regional
Supply Office in Norfolk.

21:14.233 --> 21:17.486
Okay, the dead guy downstairs
who we thought was impersonating

21:17.653 --> 21:20.656
Petty Officer Jerry Smith is actually
the real Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.075
And that Jerry Smith
Tony and Ziva talked to in Norfolk

21:23.283 --> 21:26.370
turns out to be the fake Jerry Smith,
and it's confusing.

21:26.578 --> 21:29.331
Like the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle--

21:30.123 --> 21:32.793
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

21:33.377 --> 21:36.380
<i>Court Jester? Danny Kaye?
Come on, guys, it's a classic.</i>

21:36.588 --> 21:38.257
- Thank you, boss.
- Who is he, McGee?

21:38.465 --> 21:41.134
John Kirby. We lifted his prints
from his desk at Norfolk.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.846
His empty desk.
He didn't report for duty today.

21:44.054 --> 21:47.558
He and Smith had overlapping tours
at Jacksonville in '02.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.685
- Kirby was discharged in '03.
- Honourably.

21:49.893 --> 21:52.896
These guys had this planned from the
first day of Smith's new assignment.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.356
Think so, McGee?

21:54.565 --> 21:56.233
- l'm gonna need Kirby's--
- Address.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.944
He lives on West Little Creek.
Been there about a year.

21:59.403 --> 22:00.571
And the warrant.

22:00.779 --> 22:03.657
- DiNozzo, David, take a ride.
- You got it, boss.

22:03.866 --> 22:06.243
Get a BOLO out on Kirby
with the FBl, local and state.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.995
- Already done, Boss.
- BOLO?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.872
''Be on the lookout.''

22:10.372 --> 22:14.042
Good job, McGee.
Go on. Catch up to them.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.881
- ''Good job, McGee.''
- ls he always this juvenile?

22:19.347 --> 22:21.433
Only on days of the week
ending with the word ''day.''

22:24.478 --> 22:25.812
- l'll drive, Tony.
- No, no, no.

22:25.979 --> 22:27.397
Not gonna make that mistake again.

22:27.606 --> 22:29.941
Did you really think
my driving was that terrible?

22:30.150 --> 22:32.402
Aside from the high speed
and near misses.

22:32.611 --> 22:35.906
Let's just say it's an acquired taste,
like regurgitated lunch.

22:36.114 --> 22:38.742
- That's disgusting, DiNozzo.
- Tell me about it, probie.

22:38.950 --> 22:42.120
That chilli cheese dog was hard
to chew the second time around.

22:42.329 --> 22:44.122
Maybe we should give her
another chance.

22:44.331 --> 22:45.916
lt's not like she killed
or maimed anyone.

22:46.082 --> 22:48.627
Maybe we should concentrate
on why John Kirby switched places

22:48.794 --> 22:52.714
with Seaman Smith at Norfolk,
and leave death wish for another day.

22:52.923 --> 22:55.884
- He could very well be an assassin.
- He works in a supply office.

22:56.092 --> 22:58.053
Who's he gonna assassinate?
Mr. Clean?

22:58.261 --> 23:00.597
All the better not
to draw attention to himself.

23:00.806 --> 23:03.058
Well, she's right.
lt's a big base. A lot of targets.

23:03.266 --> 23:04.726
l don't know. Look at the guy.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.728
- He's such a--
- Pimp.

23:07.270 --> 23:08.647
- Wimp.
- Wimp.

23:09.356 --> 23:11.650
Very much in line
with other assassins.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.026
She's right, Tony.

23:13.235 --> 23:15.779
Look at Lee Harvey Oswald,
Sirhan Sirhan.

23:18.114 --> 23:21.117
That's original, McGee. ls there
any part of your brain that's your own?

23:21.284 --> 23:22.702
At least l have one, Tony.

23:22.911 --> 23:25.831
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

23:26.039 --> 23:27.624
We're not going anywhere.

23:27.833 --> 23:31.461
- What, until l apologise?
- No, not until you apologise.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.048
We're in the wrong damn car.

23:37.175 --> 23:39.344
- What'd you find, Abs?
- After the car crashed,

23:39.511 --> 23:42.222
it went end over end
for about a hundred feet

23:43.431 --> 23:45.892
before finally slamming to a stop
up against a boulder,

23:46.059 --> 23:48.103
which crushed the driver's side door
into his body,

23:48.311 --> 23:52.440
which led to a lot of blood.
l also found these in the trunk,

23:52.649 --> 23:56.027
three identical sets of Hawaiian shirts
and khaki pants.

23:56.236 --> 23:58.363
Correction.
Did you find anything useful?

23:58.572 --> 24:00.532
Maybe. But it's probably nothing.

24:02.033 --> 24:04.828
Do not make me say
a magic word now, Abs.

24:05.287 --> 24:07.622
Of course not. But it is a cool idea.

24:07.831 --> 24:09.082
lt's in the blood patterns.

24:09.249 --> 24:13.587
The residual splatter
from where the blood struck is there.

24:13.795 --> 24:15.547
Exit-wound splatter is there.

24:16.423 --> 24:18.758
Dropping slightly
from the angle of the impact.

24:18.967 --> 24:20.552
Normal when they pass
through flesh.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.095
Very good, Gibbs.

24:22.304 --> 24:26.057
But that would be the case
of a senior lead special agent

24:26.266 --> 24:28.351
who's worked hundreds
of crime scene investigations

24:28.518 --> 24:29.728
throughout his storied career.

24:29.895 --> 24:32.314
l'd hate to start smacking you
like l do DiNozzo.

24:32.522 --> 24:34.941
You wouldn't. You would?

24:35.150 --> 24:36.693
lt won't be on the head.

24:39.946 --> 24:44.993
The blood here is darker,
and the pattern is random.

24:45.869 --> 24:47.829
Skip to the ''probably nothing'' part,
will you?

24:47.996 --> 24:50.916
The trail of splattering
is wider than you'd expect.

24:51.124 --> 24:55.045
And the blood is smeared
somewhat here

24:55.212 --> 24:56.755
like something
brushed up against it.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.800
- What?
- l have absolutely no idea.

25:00.008 --> 25:01.968
That would be
the probably nothing part.

25:03.512 --> 25:05.263
l haven't analysed it
in my computer yet.

25:05.430 --> 25:06.765
Do it.

25:12.270 --> 25:14.731
Oh, l love Hawaiian shirts.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.191
l'm not surprised.

25:16.399 --> 25:19.319
lt's a cultural experience
you couldn't appreciate.

25:19.528 --> 25:22.447
- lsn't that right, probie?
- l wouldn't be caught dead in one.

25:24.241 --> 25:26.326
lt can't be.

25:26.535 --> 25:28.537
Do you realise what we have here?

25:28.745 --> 25:29.996
Another ugly shirt?

25:31.998 --> 25:35.085
<i>lt's an authentic Magnum, P.l.
Jungle Bird design.</i>

25:35.293 --> 25:37.879
Hundred percent cotton,
bamboo buttons,

25:38.421 --> 25:40.674
''Made in Hawaii'' label.

25:40.882 --> 25:44.136
Come on, this is the Holy Grail
of Aloha garments.

25:44.344 --> 25:47.556
- That's great.
- Eight seasons Magnum wore this.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.892
Putting up with Higgins
and those stupid dogs.

25:51.101 --> 25:52.644
Zeus. Apollo.

25:55.397 --> 25:57.399
lt was a TV show,
it was big in the '80s.

25:57.607 --> 25:59.151
l know who Tom Selleck is, Tony.

25:59.359 --> 26:01.695
The hot, sexy
American man of adventure.

26:02.487 --> 26:04.698
He was-- He was good, sure.

26:04.906 --> 26:08.994
But take away the shirt, moustache,
Detroit Tigers hat, Ferrari, the Audi,

26:09.202 --> 26:13.623
wine cellar, Robin Masters' estate,
Rick, TC and the helicopter.

26:13.832 --> 26:16.126
Well, it looks like Kirby
has not checked his e-mail

26:16.334 --> 26:19.045
or even turned on his computer
since yesterday.

26:19.254 --> 26:22.007
Once he saw us at Norfolk,
he must have taken a kite.

26:22.215 --> 26:25.677
Hike.
The expression is ''taking a hike.''

26:25.886 --> 26:28.472
She may have had it confused
with ''go fly a kite.''

26:28.722 --> 26:34.227
l speak five languages, forgive me
if l get confused sometimes.

26:41.526 --> 26:44.029
- l found his bankbook.
- Chequebook.

26:44.237 --> 26:47.866
Whatever you call it.
His deposits seem high.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.411
Where you come from,
they may seem high

26:51.620 --> 26:54.790
but here in the good old U.S. of A.,
these are really, really high.

26:59.419 --> 27:01.505
l think it's the--

27:15.101 --> 27:16.812
- lt's a--
- lt's a marmoset.

27:17.020 --> 27:18.772
Actually, that's a capuchin.

27:18.980 --> 27:22.067
l don't advise shooting him.
Americans and their pets.

27:22.275 --> 27:23.902
lt will be a public-relations
nightmare.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.153
You knew all about this.

27:25.362 --> 27:27.405
l tried to tell you,
but you shushed me.

27:27.614 --> 27:29.199
Well, next time try harder.

27:29.407 --> 27:30.575
His name is Max.

27:30.784 --> 27:34.746
Oh, l read a Snapple cap that said
that the most popular name for a pet

27:34.955 --> 27:36.832
in the United States is Max.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.625
That's funny, l thought it was Tim.

27:39.876 --> 27:42.838
We know that your husband
and John Kirby served together.

27:43.046 --> 27:45.257
And we also know
that they switched places.

27:45.465 --> 27:49.136
lt's a federal crime
to impersonate military personnel.

27:49.344 --> 27:53.014
Which means that withholding
any information

27:53.223 --> 27:58.270
is a chargeable offence.
So, what do you know, Mrs. Smith?

28:01.606 --> 28:05.110
l lied before.
l saw the other man once.

28:05.694 --> 28:07.320
When?

28:08.905 --> 28:10.907
Right after we moved here
from Hawaii.

28:11.074 --> 28:13.535
l came home early from yoga.
l wasn't feeling well.

28:13.743 --> 28:16.121
He was with Jerry in the den.

28:16.329 --> 28:17.789
Jerry was upset.

28:19.541 --> 28:21.793
lt was clear l'd interrupted them.

28:23.003 --> 28:28.175
When he left, he said
l should forget l ever saw him

28:28.383 --> 28:31.261
and never tell anyone.

28:31.595 --> 28:34.806
Do you think he's the one
who killed my husband?

28:37.809 --> 28:38.935
Kirby was getting e-mails

28:39.144 --> 28:41.396
from an anonymous lnternet account
several times a week.

28:41.563 --> 28:43.190
Each one
was just a time and a location.

28:43.398 --> 28:45.233
The times were random
all throughout the day,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.569
the locations were business
and residential addresses

28:47.736 --> 28:48.987
all throughout Norfolk.

28:49.196 --> 28:52.282
- How long have they been coming in?
- About four months.

28:53.116 --> 28:55.285
Same time Kirby's
been posing as Smith.

28:55.494 --> 28:58.455
You think Kirby was doing Smith's job,
while Smith was doing Kirby's?

28:59.664 --> 29:01.541
l've seen communications
like this before.

29:01.708 --> 29:03.794
- So have l.
- Many intelligence agencies

29:03.960 --> 29:05.712
use this technique
for arranging a drop-off.

29:06.213 --> 29:08.882
l believe you refer to them
as goblins.

29:09.090 --> 29:11.301
Spooks. The term is spooks.

29:11.510 --> 29:14.054
According to this, there's
a drop scheduled for this afternoon.

29:14.221 --> 29:16.181
- Where and when, Abs?
- Granby and Harbor,

29:16.348 --> 29:17.891
southeast corner, 1 400.

29:18.099 --> 29:19.976
One of you is gonna have
to pose as Kirby.

29:24.397 --> 29:26.358
That really doesn't work for him.

29:26.525 --> 29:29.736
For once, l've got to agree with Tony.
l don't think l'm a Hawaiian-shirt type.

29:29.945 --> 29:32.656
You're the closest we've got to age
and looks to Smith and Kirby.

29:32.823 --> 29:35.492
Which won't matter if whoever
he's meeting with knows their faces.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.620
No, it won't. But if it doesn't,
we just might get something,

29:38.787 --> 29:40.664
which is more than we have now.

29:41.081 --> 29:44.584
DiNozzo, you and Ziva
will be here mobile on Granby,

29:44.793 --> 29:46.837
as far as you can
while maintaining visual contact.

29:47.003 --> 29:48.171
l'll be over here on Harbor.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.257
McGee, we do not know
what we have here.

29:50.465 --> 29:54.302
So go with the flow.
lf it gets hinky, call it.

29:54.511 --> 29:56.930
Hinky? What's hinky?

29:57.139 --> 29:59.641
You know, like when your gut
is telling you something?

29:59.850 --> 30:04.688
Oh, l see. ln my country,
we refer to that as gas.

30:06.731 --> 30:09.151
<i>You got a visual, DiNozzo?</i>

30:09.359 --> 30:10.819
Affirmative, boss.

30:11.027 --> 30:13.655
Suck that gut in, probie.

30:18.952 --> 30:20.287
Guy with the briefcase.

30:20.495 --> 30:21.705
l got him, McGee.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.626
The logistics for the drop
may only start here, McGee.

30:26.835 --> 30:29.129
<i>- Look for any sign.
- Like what?</i>

30:29.337 --> 30:32.591
A hand gesture,
the angle he holds his briefcase.

30:39.764 --> 30:41.558
<i>lt's nothing, boss.</i>

30:44.895 --> 30:47.272
- Lost the visual.
- Same here, DiNozzo.

30:47.481 --> 30:48.940
Move up the block.

31:01.203 --> 31:06.166
There's a park bench across the street
from the Baltimore Museum of Art.

31:06.374 --> 31:09.085
<i>- Leave it underneath.
- Girl with the pack.</i>

31:09.294 --> 31:11.505
Wait, McGee,
for her to make the move.

31:11.713 --> 31:13.799
- Don't be late.
- Right.

31:20.764 --> 31:23.099
<i>- Kirby, my 9 o'clock, boss.
- l got him. Get the girl.</i>

31:23.308 --> 31:25.560
Go. Go. Go.

31:48.583 --> 31:50.127
We lost her.

31:51.503 --> 31:53.630
More like she lost us.

32:01.671 --> 32:04.716
There are three wheels,
numbered zero through nine each.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.885
- That's a thousand possibilities.
- Then your fingers better get busy.

32:08.136 --> 32:09.220
Wait, there's more.

32:09.387 --> 32:12.849
The seams are filled with something
that looks like an epoxy material.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.142
May be for waterproofing.

32:14.309 --> 32:17.145
Or to hold explosive components
in place until they're exploded.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.646
X-rays.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.316
Didn't penetrate.
The metal's high-density steel,

32:21.482 --> 32:23.234
probably with a thin layer
of lead sheeting.

32:23.401 --> 32:26.404
- The nitrate sniffer came up negative.
- That's because of the epoxy.

32:26.571 --> 32:27.822
Probably.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.783
Gibbs, it might not be rigged
with a bomb, per se.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.869
l love saying per se.
lt's one of those phrases

32:33.036 --> 32:35.830
nobody really knows what it means,
but you say it anyway.

32:36.039 --> 32:37.415
- Am l off topic again?
- Bigtime.

32:38.041 --> 32:41.586
lt could be armed with something
like formic acid in a glass liner.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.922
Destroy the contents
if opened incorrectly.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.215
There's also the possibility
it could be nothing.

32:46.424 --> 32:49.385
lt's just a bluff to scare anyone
from taking a peek inside.

32:49.594 --> 32:52.931
- Do we have a bottom line here, Abs?
- We do.

32:53.723 --> 32:54.933
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Yes.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.602
The bomb squad is gonna pick this
up, they'll do their thing

32:57.769 --> 32:59.938
and then l will get to the bottom
of this, but--

33:00.104 --> 33:01.522
lt's going to take time.

33:01.731 --> 33:04.943
See? We are having
a melding of the minds.

33:05.193 --> 33:07.737
<i>- lt was called The Transporter.
- Didn't see it.</i>

33:07.946 --> 33:10.281
Cool British guy
delivers illegal stuff for a price.

33:10.448 --> 33:11.950
Obviously, what Smith was doing.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.409
Then what Kirby was doing.

33:13.618 --> 33:15.203
Then what you were doing, probie.

33:15.411 --> 33:18.373
- Only badly.
- Yeah, l got the case, didn't l?

33:18.581 --> 33:21.626
- You're missing the point.
- How could there possibly be a point?

33:21.876 --> 33:23.544
l think what Agent DiNozzo means

33:23.711 --> 33:26.631
is that the Transporter would have
gotten the case, gotten the girl

33:26.881 --> 33:28.800
and still have held on
to his cappuccino.

33:28.967 --> 33:32.136
Exactly. Speaking of movies, you know
what l was thinking about, probie?

33:32.387 --> 33:34.973
<i>- Really not interested, Tony.
- Mr. & Mrs. Smith.</i>

33:35.223 --> 33:36.808
ldentity mystery.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.977
Then there's our Smith.
ldentity mystery.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.728
And if it turns out the guy

33:40.895 --> 33:43.231
charging porn and tractors
on your credit card is a Smith,

33:43.398 --> 33:44.941
- then that's identity mystery.
- Tony?

33:45.149 --> 33:47.485
Not now, probie.
l'm almost done with this level.

33:51.155 --> 33:53.449
Find out what's in the case yet,
boss?

33:56.995 --> 33:58.705
- Are you going to interrogate Kirby?
- No.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.833
That is a mistake. The longer we wait,
the more time he has to--

34:02.000 --> 34:03.585
l am going to be interrogating Kirby.

34:05.420 --> 34:08.505
You and DiNozzo will be observing.

34:09.924 --> 34:13.761
lt takes a while for him
to warm up to people, doesn't it?

34:13.969 --> 34:15.804
Wanna know how to get
on his good side?

34:16.014 --> 34:18.181
- Of course.
- Me too.

34:21.853 --> 34:24.147
l didn't kill Jerry.

34:26.482 --> 34:27.817
l know. We checked.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.610
You were on base
when it happened.

34:33.531 --> 34:36.199
So can l go now?

34:36.451 --> 34:39.370
lmpersonating a petty officer.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.165
That's a felony.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.708
Lying during a federal investigation,

34:44.918 --> 34:46.168
felony.

34:46.377 --> 34:47.420
Resisting arrest.

34:48.963 --> 34:50.005
That's a misdemeanour.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.926
Not to mention what we have
in that case downstairs.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.844
You looked in the case?

34:56.137 --> 34:58.514
Look, l was only trying to help.
l swear to you.

34:58.723 --> 35:00.016
lt wasn't even my idea.

35:00.224 --> 35:02.727
l doubt this has anything to do
with espionage, Tony.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.521
Kirby's far too stupid
for this line of work.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.440
Why did you two switch places?

35:07.649 --> 35:11.069
Because Jerry,

35:11.319 --> 35:13.655
he couldn't keep it
in his damn pants.

35:15.198 --> 35:17.033
Keep what in his pants?

35:17.909 --> 35:20.036
You're kidding, right?

35:20.578 --> 35:22.372
Come on.

35:27.252 --> 35:28.920
Dancing?

35:29.879 --> 35:32.423
- Yeah, dancing.
- What happened?

35:32.590 --> 35:36.761
He'd been fooling around
with this officer's wife over at Pearl.

35:37.011 --> 35:41.766
One night, the officer came home
early and caught him in the act.

35:41.975 --> 35:46.729
He got a good look at Jerry's face,
but he didn't recognise him.

35:48.439 --> 35:49.524
Jerry wasn't worried.

35:50.483 --> 35:53.778
He knew he was shipping out
the next week

35:54.112 --> 35:55.989
and they'd never met before.

35:58.283 --> 35:59.534
That was the good news.

35:59.742 --> 36:02.620
Until he got the bad news.

36:03.246 --> 36:05.123
The husband was gonna be
his C.O. in Norfolk.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.041
Commander Morris.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.376
Yes, sir.

36:08.543 --> 36:11.379
Jerry only had four months left
to an honourable discharge.

36:11.588 --> 36:13.715
Morris would have made sure
that didn't happen.

36:13.923 --> 36:16.134
- Who else knew about it?
- No one.

36:16.384 --> 36:19.095
That's why Jerry begged me
to switch places with him.

36:19.596 --> 36:23.266
Except l couldn't leave my job.

36:23.474 --> 36:24.934
Delivering illegal goods.

36:25.143 --> 36:28.771
Wait. l mean, l didn't even know
what was in the cases.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.607
l was strictly transportation.

36:30.815 --> 36:33.902
Hey, Kirby,
they weren't exactly using FedEx.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.404
- lt was stupid, l know.
- Yeah.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.448
But the money was really good.

36:38.656 --> 36:41.659
Life since the Navy...

36:43.077 --> 36:44.537
...has been kind of hard on me.

36:45.038 --> 36:47.624
- You never looked inside?
- No.

36:47.832 --> 36:49.626
There were only two rules.

36:50.627 --> 36:52.921
Be on time

36:53.463 --> 36:54.672
and don't look in the cases.

36:54.839 --> 36:56.549
Jerry,

36:57.258 --> 36:58.509
l guess he looked.

37:00.136 --> 37:01.846
Then they killed him for it.

37:02.764 --> 37:05.099
l think--
l think l want to get a lawyer now.

37:05.308 --> 37:07.060
Oh, yeah.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.853
You're gonna need one.

37:11.606 --> 37:14.692
Remember that smeared area
that l thought was probably nothing?

37:14.859 --> 37:17.153
Well, it probably
might not be probably nothing.

37:17.362 --> 37:19.489
l'm not saying a magic word, Abs.

37:19.697 --> 37:22.283
Okay, this is the windshield
of the vehicle.

37:22.450 --> 37:24.202
See the smeared marks?
There's four of them.

37:24.369 --> 37:27.288
And they connect together.
Now, step back and squint.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.123
At what?

37:29.332 --> 37:31.376
Just do it
like when you're trying to figure out

37:31.584 --> 37:34.879
the hidden message
in the bad 3-D art at the fair.

37:36.714 --> 37:41.052
This is important.
Try to see the bigger picture for once.

37:46.683 --> 37:48.226
See it?

37:53.481 --> 37:56.401
- Maybe an M.
- Yes, Gibbs, yes.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.403
Those smears
were smeared on purpose.

37:58.611 --> 38:00.321
Now, these are the photographs

38:00.530 --> 38:03.032
of Petty Officer Smith's body
before it was washed.

38:03.741 --> 38:06.119
He has blood
on his right index finger.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.870
There were no lacerations
on that hand.

38:08.079 --> 38:11.249
Petty Officer Smith used his finger
to write a message in his own blood.

38:11.416 --> 38:14.252
Sometimes people in the throes
of death try to communicate.

38:14.502 --> 38:16.879
Like that guy
in the L.A. Metro Rail crash,

38:17.046 --> 38:18.881
he wrote l love you to his wife
in his blood.

38:19.048 --> 38:20.633
- He lived?
- He did.

38:20.842 --> 38:25.096
But Petty Officer Smith
is trying to tell us who killed him.

38:28.349 --> 38:31.269
<i>- What does M mean?
- Commander Morris.</i>

38:31.436 --> 38:33.688
How could you think
that l had to do with his murder?

38:33.855 --> 38:36.441
Because you found out he was the
sailor sleeping with your wife.

38:36.608 --> 38:40.194
- At Pearl.
- Yes, commander, at Pearl Harbor.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.738
That was Smith?

38:41.946 --> 38:44.741
lf l had known who he was,
l would have killed him myself.

38:44.908 --> 38:47.285
But l didn't. l was here that morning.

38:47.452 --> 38:50.079
There's a dozen witnesses
who will vouch for that.

38:54.709 --> 38:58.129
Surveillance camera at the main gate
has Commander Morris

38:58.296 --> 39:01.382
coming on base an hour
before Smith's time of death.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.719
- Leeway at time of death?
- Ducky says 1 5, maybe 20 minutes.

39:04.928 --> 39:06.596
Drive time to the crime scene?

39:06.804 --> 39:08.473
Thirty minutes.
Fifteen if you're driving.

39:08.681 --> 39:11.309
Seven sailors in his office all verify
he was in the supply unit

39:11.476 --> 39:13.144
- until we showed up.
- Where?

39:13.311 --> 39:15.313
Mostly in his private office,
behind closed doors.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.816
Was there another exit? Could he have
left unseen through a window?

39:19.067 --> 39:21.319
Windows don't open, boss.
Solid plate glass.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.321
Morris couldn't have been
at the crime scene.

39:23.488 --> 39:26.241
- Yeah, l know that, McGee.
- He knows that, McGee.

39:27.283 --> 39:29.994
His murder has to be related
to the delivery service.

39:30.203 --> 39:31.579
Which we know nothing about.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.915
Kirby claims he didn't know
who he was working for.

39:34.332 --> 39:37.168
Was Petty Officer Smith wearing
his seat belt when he crashed?

39:39.796 --> 39:43.800
Was Petty Officer Smith
wearing a seat belt?

39:45.843 --> 39:48.137
No. He wasn't wearing a seat belt
in the crash.

39:48.346 --> 39:51.516
He was in an unnaturally
contorted position.

39:51.766 --> 39:54.352
Yes. Very, very unusual.

39:58.356 --> 39:59.857
l can flip the image,

40:01.192 --> 40:02.277
only if you want.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.702
- W.
- What was the wife's name again?

40:10.868 --> 40:12.537
lt's Wendy.

40:13.371 --> 40:15.707
Did you discover your husband
was cheating on you, Wendy?

40:18.001 --> 40:19.544
l don't know
what you're talking about.

40:19.752 --> 40:22.547
Must have been a real shock.
You were so much in love with him.

40:22.755 --> 40:26.884
The one decent man you've ever met
wasn't really decent at all, was he?

40:27.051 --> 40:28.469
That's not true.

40:28.678 --> 40:31.055
He called you on the way to work.
You weren't home.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.891
l was. He called me at home.

40:34.142 --> 40:37.228
Phone records show you forwarded
your home phone to your cell.

40:37.395 --> 40:39.564
He had no idea you followed him,
Wendy.

40:39.814 --> 40:41.399
He only worked
a couple of days a week.

40:41.649 --> 40:44.986
l wonder what he did
with all the rest of that free time?

40:54.579 --> 40:57.582
Did you know he cheated on me
on our wedding day?

41:00.084 --> 41:02.003
Our wedding day.

41:02.211 --> 41:04.339
<i>Honey, honey, it's our anniversary.</i>

41:20.939 --> 41:22.815
Great, thank you.

41:24.025 --> 41:28.112
Well, that takes care of them all.
Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, Diners.

41:28.321 --> 41:29.948
Old cards cancelled,
new ones reissued.

41:30.114 --> 41:31.532
lt only took me 200 phone calls.

41:31.741 --> 41:33.243
You know what l find interesting?

41:33.451 --> 41:36.829
- What?
- That you actually have Diners.

41:37.038 --> 41:39.082
- What's wrong with that?
- l've never met anyone

41:39.249 --> 41:42.460
who used Diners Club
who wasn't wearing Depends.

41:42.627 --> 41:44.545
lt's a very hip piece of plastic, Tony.

41:44.712 --> 41:47.298
Yes, in the year 1 927.

41:47.715 --> 41:50.051
Good news and bad news.
The good news is l'm still cute.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.971
Bad news, the bomb squad
got a little trigger happy.

41:54.597 --> 41:56.140
They blew up the metal box?

41:56.391 --> 41:59.310
Do you have any idea
what's beyond smithereens?

41:59.477 --> 42:01.104
- Not a clue.
- Me neither.

42:01.312 --> 42:03.564
That's what we've got.

42:03.773 --> 42:05.817
- There's not much l can do.
- Nope.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.485
Except put it back together.

42:07.652 --> 42:11.739
Gibbs. lt's in like a jillion pieces.
That would take months.

42:11.948 --> 42:14.117
lt's the only link we have
to that delivery service.

42:14.325 --> 42:18.454
Yeah? Well you're not the one that has
to put it back together, Officer David.

42:23.084 --> 42:24.544
She doesn't like me, does she?

42:40.518 --> 42:44.022
- Are you going home?
- Not yet.

42:45.273 --> 42:49.110
l thought l might be able
to help you with that.

42:50.278 --> 42:52.655
Do you have a degree
in forensic science?

42:52.864 --> 42:54.407
No.

42:55.116 --> 42:57.952
But l'm very good at jigsaw puzzles.

42:59.787 --> 43:01.706
We'll see.
