00:19.833 --> 00:21.375
<i>Any news on the rooftop?</i>

00:22.083 --> 00:23.875
<i>All in order here, sir.</i>

00:30.500 --> 00:31.333
Suárez.

00:32.875 --> 00:33.958
Martínez!

00:35.625 --> 00:37.541
Colonel, it's Gandía.

00:38.833 --> 00:40.083
Gandía, I'm here.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.166
<i>Colonel,</i>

00:41.791 --> 00:44.083
<i>I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.</i>

00:44.875 --> 00:46.625
<i>I'm launching another attack.</i>

00:46.708 --> 00:49.208
<i>-I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.</i>
<i>-Radio!</i>

00:51.958 --> 00:55.416
-I want all units on alert.
-Alpha and Beta units, get ready.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.125
<i>-Everyone ready and on alert.</i>
<i>-</i>Go.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.541
<i>Everyone ready.</i>

01:04.458 --> 01:06.000
Colonel, they're shooting!

01:07.875 --> 01:10.666
Gandía, answer me.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.000
<i>Gandía, do you copy?</i>

01:12.083 --> 01:13.291
<i>Gandía here.</i>

01:13.375 --> 01:16.583
<i>They're closing in on me.</i>
<i>I'm caught in the cross fire.</i>

01:16.875 --> 01:19.125
Where are you? Can we give cover fire?

01:19.208 --> 01:22.000
<i>Negative, Colonel. I'm going to the roof.</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:23.291
<i>I request evacuation!</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:25.708
Suárez, send a helicopter, now.

01:25.791 --> 01:27.833
-Come on!
-Delta 1, prepare for takeoff.

01:27.916 --> 01:29.958
Rescue operation
at the Bank of Spain, now!

01:33.458 --> 01:34.291
<i>Taking off.</i>

01:37.625 --> 01:40.000
<i>They're starting a fire. I can't see!</i>

01:40.083 --> 01:41.708
Colonel.

01:42.541 --> 01:45.541
<i>Smoke! There's smoke on the roof, sir.</i>

01:46.708 --> 01:49.041
Hold on. The helicopter's coming.

01:49.666 --> 01:51.291
Go to the roof. We'll cover you.

01:51.375 --> 01:55.166
<i>Exiting now. I'm wearing black</i>
<i>and a ski mask. Hold fire.</i>

01:55.666 --> 01:59.458
Our man's in black. Cover him.
Be ready for possible cross fire.

01:59.541 --> 02:00.625
Come on!

02:04.875 --> 02:05.916
Go!

02:06.416 --> 02:08.125
Let's go!

02:11.791 --> 02:13.666
They're on the roof. They're firing!

02:16.875 --> 02:18.750
Cover fire!

02:18.833 --> 02:20.833
<i>No visual. There's too much smoke.</i>

02:23.916 --> 02:26.416
-Where's the helicopter?
-Delta, position.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.750
<i>Two minutes, fifty seconds, sir.</i>

02:36.375 --> 02:38.833
Delta, begin approach maneuver. 

02:38.916 --> 02:40.500
<i>Rescue protocol.</i>

02:40.583 --> 02:42.958
I want a quick, clean extraction.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.750
<i>Helicopter in position.</i>

02:57.833 --> 02:59.625
Get it down there!

02:59.708 --> 03:01.583
Go ahead, proceed.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.875
<i>Target in sight.</i>

03:13.875 --> 03:17.833
<i>I have one in my line of fire.</i>
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

03:22.583 --> 03:27.291
45 HOURS EARLIER

03:27.375 --> 03:30.083
<i>Mutt, I said I was going to kill you.</i>

03:32.041 --> 03:33.166
No!

03:38.875 --> 03:40.833
Ten, nine,

03:41.666 --> 03:43.875
eight, seven,

03:44.458 --> 03:46.458
six, five,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.083
four, three,

03:49.875 --> 03:52.000
two, one...

03:53.625 --> 03:54.541
zero!

04:14.916 --> 04:15.958
What happened?

04:16.041 --> 04:18.583
Your friend Nairobi threw a grenade at me.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.041
Is Nairobi OK?

04:21.375 --> 04:23.083
I asked if Nairobi is OK!

04:23.166 --> 04:24.916
I don't know if she's OK,

04:25.666 --> 04:28.291
but she can certainly get up, the bitch.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.833
Is she recovering?

04:31.833 --> 04:33.166
I think so.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.750
You were an awesome surgeon.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.083
Are you aware
you're bleeding like a stuck pig?

06:16.250 --> 06:19.625
Do you have to change your suit
in front of all these people?

06:19.750 --> 06:22.166
This isn't a suit. It's the uniform

06:22.250 --> 06:25.583
of a filthy executive
who checks stocks during dinner.

06:25.666 --> 06:28.833
It got you an interview
with the governor of the Bank of Spain.

06:28.916 --> 06:31.041
Isn't it good enough for a cocktail?

06:31.125 --> 06:34.750
You should have parked the car.
Martín complains much less.

06:34.833 --> 06:35.708
Of course.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.291
Now what's wrong with Martín?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.666
He follows you everywhere.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.375
So?

06:44.791 --> 06:46.208
He's in love with you.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.875
In love with me.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.708
Does he write my name in his notebooks?

06:52.791 --> 06:56.583
-Or did he confess in drunken tears?
-I see how he looks at you.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.583
How he smiles at all of your crazy ideas.

06:59.666 --> 07:02.041
How he agrees with what you say
about the plan.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.333
He can't formulate a critical opinion.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.875
He's in love.
That stops him being objective.

07:06.958 --> 07:10.291
He's totally objective.
He's an engineer. He doesn't weigh in.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.166
He does equations,

07:12.250 --> 07:15.750
and no feelings are involved
in any of those calculations.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.666
-We both know the plan's a disaster.
-The plan is fantastic.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.916
It has some fantastic details,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.791
but it doesn't work as a plan.
It doesn't work.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.750
-Why did you call me?
-I want to share it with you.

07:30.666 --> 07:33.833
It's the biggest job of my life.
I want my brother there.

07:34.291 --> 07:37.583
You want me to be the brains
that he's not providing.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.375
And you...

07:40.458 --> 07:43.083
you know how to get the gold out,
not yourselves.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.125
And you have no idea
how you'll live the rest of your lives

07:46.208 --> 07:48.500
with 90 tons of gold
without being found out.

07:48.583 --> 07:52.666
An analytical mind, however small,
would work that out straightaway.

07:52.750 --> 07:53.750
But not you guys.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.666
Because you're in love with the plan...

07:57.458 --> 07:59.291
and he's just in love with you.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.791
We're guided by passion.
You're blinded by hatred.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.041
Hatred for romanticism.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.541
Maybe because suicide
is one of its main characteristics.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.208
This plan is suicide.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.791
Still finding faults?

08:10.875 --> 08:14.541
He'll get over it. When he's stressed,
he's all doom and gloom.

08:14.625 --> 08:18.375
Well... I'm going to the bathroom.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.625
Do you want to come with me, Sergio?

08:21.625 --> 08:27.208
Have you ever had the privilege
of an experienced man giving you fellatio?

08:30.583 --> 08:31.791
I'm joking.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.333
<i>Freezing up,</i>
<i>disorientation, a blank stare...</i>

08:48.333 --> 08:51.958
<i>and, above all,</i>
<i>the feeling of floating outside reality.</i>

08:53.708 --> 08:56.375
<i>Those are the consequences</i>
<i>of emotional shock.</i>

08:57.916 --> 08:59.958
<i>But you can also go the other way.</i>

09:03.333 --> 09:04.791
<i>An unbridled rage</i>

09:05.333 --> 09:06.708
<i>that only seeks...</i>

09:08.541 --> 09:09.416
<i>revenge.</i>

09:13.333 --> 09:14.500
It's open.

09:26.958 --> 09:27.916
Clear.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.125
Blood.

09:34.416 --> 09:35.458
Fuck.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.583
Clear.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.166
<i>We've found the panic room, sir.</i>

10:01.250 --> 10:04.833
Gandía is shut up inside.
He's injured and he has Tokyo.

10:04.916 --> 10:06.583
Is he badly injured?

10:07.666 --> 10:09.791
<i>A grenade exploded on his back.</i>

10:10.041 --> 10:12.458
He'll try to negotiate.
Time's on our side.

10:12.541 --> 10:15.708
-If he wants to live, he can't harm Tokyo.
-I'm not so sure.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.583
Professor...

10:20.791 --> 10:22.208
he killed Nairobi.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.166
Is that a yes?

11:11.333 --> 11:15.083
We'll pay them back 100 times over
for what they did to Nairobi.

11:20.791 --> 11:23.541
<i>The Professor no longer felt any pain.</i>

11:24.000 --> 11:27.458
<i>He was detached from his emotions</i>
<i>and was operating like a machine.</i>

11:27.541 --> 11:29.958
We'll destroy that tent in seven steps.

11:30.041 --> 11:34.291
<i>-All he could think of was his next move.</i>
-It starts with the truth.

11:34.375 --> 11:38.041
If you want to tell the truth,
you need to speak to Rio first.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.916
There are things you don't know.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.833
Professor.

11:42.916 --> 11:44.333
<i>From that moment,</i>

11:44.416 --> 11:47.666
<i>absolutely everything</i>
<i>would become a plan of attack.</i>

11:47.750 --> 11:49.750
<i>-Professor.</i>
<i>-In the hours that followed,</i>

11:49.833 --> 11:51.375
<i>he'd launch missiles.</i>

11:51.458 --> 11:56.166
You said getting out was impossible,
but we'd get out. Keep your word.

11:56.958 --> 12:01.250
I said when we'd melted
and extracted the gold, I'd get you out.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.500
And I stand by that.

12:05.541 --> 12:07.875
Palermo, get Tokyo out.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.750
I'll go to the foundry.
Denver, come with me.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.625
<i>Everyone on alert.</i>

12:16.625 --> 12:18.625
<i>Bomb disposal robot is advancing.</i>

12:18.708 --> 12:20.208
Go ahead. Let's go.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.708
<i>Ready to deactivate</i>
<i>the bombs at the entrance.</i>

12:44.958 --> 12:46.000
Nairobi is dead.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.500
From now on, I'm in charge.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.166
We're going to be efficient.
How many tons have we done?

12:55.083 --> 12:56.125
Forty-four.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.875
-What is this, recess?
-That's three less than the target.

12:59.958 --> 13:04.125
Raise the temperature to 1,750ºC.
We need to increase the production rate.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.791
-Is there no one inside?
-No.

13:05.875 --> 13:10.083
There should be. Let's get moving.
We have to get this gold out.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.041
Denver.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.708
Get every last gram of gold.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.875
I want to get the hell out of here.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.458
Now! Quick! Come on!

13:29.458 --> 13:30.375
Professor.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.833
No, we have a problem.
I'll create a firewall.

13:32.916 --> 13:35.208
-I'll put you through.
<i>-</i>OK, hurry up.

13:39.666 --> 13:40.791
Out!

13:40.875 --> 13:42.125
Shame on you!

13:42.208 --> 13:45.291
<i>Beginning procedure to defuse</i>
<i>the first explosive. Take cover.</i>

13:46.333 --> 13:50.041
<i>Units one and two, ready to advance</i>
<i>once the devices are disconnected.</i>

13:58.208 --> 13:59.666
Fucking firewall.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.333
-<i>Professor.</i>
-Yes.

14:07.416 --> 14:10.083
I shouldn't tell you,
but they're planning a massacre.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.083
<i>They're going to storm the bank.</i>

14:12.166 --> 14:15.166
<i>They're trying to contact Gandía</i>
<i>to work together.</i>

14:16.000 --> 14:19.333
Understood.
Did you give Lisbon my message?

14:19.416 --> 14:20.541
Yes.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.083
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.

14:23.625 --> 14:24.916
Don't let anyone in.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.416
For God's sake,
why didn't you say anything?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.708
What would I have gained? A bit of pity?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.375
Oh, Alicia...

14:42.625 --> 14:43.750
Paris.

14:46.625 --> 14:51.041
<i>She got very emotional.</i>
<i>She went all doe-eyed.</i>

14:52.583 --> 14:53.958
<i>If you had seen her...</i>

14:58.291 --> 14:59.458
Thank you, Benito.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.708
-Listen.
-I'm listening.

15:06.791 --> 15:08.916
The cops and Gandía
are planning an attack.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.666
Knock out the phone in the panic room.
Cut it all off.

15:11.750 --> 15:16.208
One very important thing:
don't kill Gandía, I need him alive.

15:16.291 --> 15:20.833
-With Tokyo in there, it'll be difficult.
-I said alive. It's key to the plan.

15:22.375 --> 15:25.500
Search for electromagnetic waves
and cut the cables.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.750
When he's totally incommunicado,
without cameras, start opening the door.

15:29.833 --> 15:32.958
Use angle grinders, hammers...
Make lots of noise.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.416
<i>Make sure he knows about it</i>
<i>and won't look elsewhere.</i>

15:35.500 --> 15:39.750
Meanwhile, we drill a small hole
through the back wall

15:39.833 --> 15:41.958
and pump in sleeping gas.

15:43.541 --> 15:45.541
When he's asleep, knock the door down.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.666
<i>-Understood?</i>
-Understood.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.625
<i>Bombs defused, sir.</i>

15:54.708 --> 15:56.375
Good. Get me Gandía.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.000
Bingo.

16:27.750 --> 16:28.666
Yoo-hoo.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.083
That'll be my friends.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.000
Colonel!

17:04.166 --> 17:05.375
Colonel!

17:06.291 --> 17:07.291
Colonel!

17:09.958 --> 17:12.625
Now you really are fucked, you bastard.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.958
<i>Of course I'll do it, however tough it is.</i>

17:19.041 --> 17:21.875
-Are you sure?
-<i>You can count on me.</i>

17:23.708 --> 17:25.791
Thank you, Rio. Thank you.

17:26.958 --> 17:31.250
THE ALGERIAN DESERT

17:32.250 --> 17:36.000
<i>-Did you find anything?</i>
-Find anything where?

17:36.708 --> 17:37.958
This is a desert.

17:38.041 --> 17:42.000
You can't call a cab and say,
"Take me to the torturers' house."

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
I gave you local backup.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.958
I speak Spanish, I speak German,

17:48.041 --> 17:51.250
Italian, French,
English, Croatian, Serbian...

17:51.333 --> 17:53.291
But I don't speak fucking Berber.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.833
I need coordinates.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.125
Give me ten minutes.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.250
Shakir, I need those satellite images.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.208
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

18:18.750 --> 18:20.416
Palermo, they're coming in.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.916
...special operations have been deployed

18:30.000 --> 18:34.208
and armored cars
and assault vehicles are on the move.

18:38.791 --> 18:42.625
<i>Just as the police</i>
<i>were about to close in on us,</i>

18:43.083 --> 18:45.541
<i>the Professor launched the first missile.</i>

18:45.666 --> 18:47.083
Open the doors.

18:49.041 --> 18:49.958
Hold position!

19:17.541 --> 19:19.333
What the hell is that?

19:22.500 --> 19:25.916
<i>A missile which was</i>
<i>a salute of honor in memory of Nairobi.</i>

19:37.333 --> 19:39.458
They're the governor's bodyguards.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.375
A funeral.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.000
THE FUCKING BOSS

20:04.041 --> 20:06.541
<i>The tent came to a standstill.</i>

20:11.250 --> 20:12.500
What's happening?

20:12.583 --> 20:13.791
Get her back inside!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.125
Let her. Out of respect.

20:21.041 --> 20:24.291
<i>Nairobi's departure filled the air</i>
<i>with a heavy silence.</i>

20:28.166 --> 20:31.833
<i>It was the disappointment of those</i>
<i>who had believed the Dalí story...</i>

20:37.041 --> 20:38.791
<i>would have a happy ending.</i>

20:45.583 --> 20:47.250
<i>But it was just a war.</i>

21:24.958 --> 21:28.166
<i>And then, the Professor launched</i>
<i>his second missile.</i>

21:31.666 --> 21:32.750
BURIED ALIVE

21:32.833 --> 21:36.250
<i>He covered Madrid with posters of Rio</i>
<i>and sent his story</i>

21:36.333 --> 21:39.208
<i>to the entire national</i>
<i>and international press.</i>

21:41.500 --> 21:44.750
<i>I was illegally detained on January 20</i>
<i>by Panamanian police...</i>

21:44.833 --> 21:46.458
Colonel, Inspector.

21:47.666 --> 21:51.000
<i>...and transferred on a secret flight</i>
<i>with the CNI colonel...</i>

21:52.125 --> 21:53.041
<i>Luis Prieto.</i>

21:53.125 --> 21:58.250
<i>We landed somewhere in the Maghreb,</i>
<i>and they tortured me until April 4.</i>

21:58.708 --> 22:01.625
<i>They put me in a cell that was so small...</i>

22:02.791 --> 22:04.375
<i>that I could only stand.</i>

22:05.250 --> 22:08.416
<i>They left me to shit and piss myself.</i>

22:10.125 --> 22:13.458
<i>And they left me there,</i>
<i>living in my own shit.</i>

22:15.791 --> 22:16.791
<i>One night...</i>

22:18.041 --> 22:21.791
<i>they took me out of my cell,</i>
<i>they took me to the desert...</i>

22:22.916 --> 22:25.250
<i>and they forced me to dig my own grave.</i>

22:27.125 --> 22:30.541
<i>They put me in a box,</i>
<i>and they buried me alive...</i>

22:31.625 --> 22:35.125
<i>until I lost consciousness,</i>
<i>believing that I had died.</i>

22:38.750 --> 22:42.166
-You buried the boy alive?
-Of course we buried him alive.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.958
What the hell gave you that idea?

22:44.041 --> 22:47.375
Why do you think we sent him to Algeria?
For a slap on the wrist?

22:47.458 --> 22:51.125
I would've preferred you put him
in a ditch, in quicklime, in cement...

22:51.208 --> 22:52.750
But buried alive?

22:52.833 --> 22:56.750
A guy describing how he was buried alive
is a fucking horror movie.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.375
In PR terms, it's like suicide.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.291
The <i>New York Times </i>published the video.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.333
Some are calling for
a commission in Strasbourg.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.875
Even Amnesty International
is filing a private prosecution.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.041
We're fucked.

23:09.125 --> 23:12.000
Did that fucking place
have phones, CCTV, Wi-Fi,

23:12.083 --> 23:14.625
or anything they may have used
to get proof?

23:14.708 --> 23:16.125
It was an abandoned hovel.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.041
There were no cameras, internet,
or roads.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.583
-That's why we went.
-It's the middle of nowhere.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.791
Not even Algerian intelligence
knows about it.

23:23.875 --> 23:27.958
And there isn't a scratch on him.
No bruising or internal bleeding.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.125
We were careful.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.125
OK.

23:31.875 --> 23:36.333
We're going to deny it like crazy.
It's his word against ours.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.791
-And you're going to do it.
-Me?

23:38.875 --> 23:39.708
Yes, you.

23:39.791 --> 23:44.666
Give it your all. The full works.
Press conference and urgent announcement.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.541
Transparency, Luis.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.416
My sugar levels are down.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.833
Where are the damn cookies?

24:36.833 --> 24:37.666
Darko.

24:41.583 --> 24:42.833
Benjamín.

24:43.791 --> 24:44.875
Thanks for coming.

24:46.500 --> 24:50.458
If Agustín, Moscow, trusted you...

24:51.625 --> 24:53.416
consider me your friend.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.833
And my daughter, is she well?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.333
Manila is fine.

25:02.666 --> 25:05.166
-Are they all miners?
-All of them.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.000
And all trustworthy.

25:07.333 --> 25:08.291
Asturians.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.750
Except...

25:11.083 --> 25:12.250
this guy.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.041
He's Polish.

25:14.875 --> 25:15.708
Captain.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.083
Thank you.

25:19.291 --> 25:20.833
Welcome, everyone.

25:21.833 --> 25:22.916
Follow me, please.

25:23.541 --> 25:24.916
Where are we going?

25:25.000 --> 25:25.916
To class.

25:26.250 --> 25:29.416
I'll explain what we're going to do
in the next 30 hours.

25:36.458 --> 25:41.708
This plan would be written off as madness
by anyone with any sense.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.875
So forget about sense.

25:49.916 --> 25:54.000
-Fucking sauna, Christ.
-Do you go to saunas?

25:56.666 --> 26:01.000
You're one of those repressed guys
who get horny in the locker room.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.083
Isn't that right?

26:08.083 --> 26:09.875
Did you know we're the same?

26:13.166 --> 26:15.416
We're just on opposite sides.

26:19.416 --> 26:21.333
I can offer you a job.

26:26.916 --> 26:27.875
Honestly...

26:30.166 --> 26:32.500
I'd rather you offered me a fuck.

26:36.958 --> 26:40.875
Is there a rule that forbids
soldiers from different sides fucking?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.208
That's not treason, right?

26:45.458 --> 26:48.083
They should put it
in the Geneva Convention.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.500
"Cease-fire!

26:51.583 --> 26:54.791
Time to fuck!"

27:03.416 --> 27:04.916
What is it that you want?

27:06.541 --> 27:08.041
I don't want anything.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.166
You turn me on.

27:54.416 --> 27:56.625
I was doing a lot of thinking.

27:57.666 --> 28:00.208
I don't really know
what's going on with me.

28:01.458 --> 28:04.291
Or what's going on with you,
but I love you.

28:05.541 --> 28:08.750
And whether we're together or not,
I'll look after you.

28:09.166 --> 28:10.166
What do you mean?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.083
What do you mean?

28:12.166 --> 28:13.666
Nairobi is dead.

28:14.958 --> 28:17.500
Things happen here
you think could never happen.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.458
But they do.

28:19.125 --> 28:21.583
It was easy in Indonesia because...

28:21.666 --> 28:24.458
you were with the only guy
who wasn't a local.

28:24.541 --> 28:27.625
But it's different here,
and I'll put up with that.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.291
And I love you.

28:30.666 --> 28:33.625
You got here, started comparing,
and I was the loser.

28:33.708 --> 28:36.500
-That's OK.
-No one's comparing you to anyone.

28:37.291 --> 28:40.500
Honestly.
And with Rio... it's not like that.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.583
I want you to know
that if you need that,

28:44.166 --> 28:46.208
if you need to be with Rio...

28:47.583 --> 28:48.583
go ahead.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.916
That's not what I need.

28:53.458 --> 28:56.583
I don't even know what I need.
Not right now.

28:57.958 --> 29:02.166
We're in the middle of all this,
and I can't think or make decisions.

29:02.250 --> 29:05.000
But you and I met each other
during a heist.

29:06.291 --> 29:08.416
And we made loads of decisions.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.333
Together.

29:34.791 --> 29:36.583
Arturo, what did you do to me?

29:39.625 --> 29:41.708
What did you do when I was asleep?

29:42.416 --> 29:46.333
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You took advantage of me.

29:46.416 --> 29:49.125
I don't know what you mean,
but now's not the time.

29:49.208 --> 29:50.166
You drugged me.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.708
You made me take
more sedatives than I should have,

29:53.791 --> 29:55.541
and I basically passed out.

29:55.625 --> 29:59.958
But before I did, I felt you up close,
touching my neck, my breast.

30:00.041 --> 30:03.583
I was drugged,
but I felt you lowering my zipper, and...

30:04.125 --> 30:05.583
you kept on touching me.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.666
You lifted my panties, Arturo.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.458
I woke up, I drifted back off...

30:12.041 --> 30:15.208
But I keep seeing images,
and my bra was broken when I woke up.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.333
Amanda.

30:17.958 --> 30:21.416
You're just very anxious. It's normal.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.333
With all this circus, OK?

30:24.041 --> 30:25.916
You must be confused

30:26.000 --> 30:29.500
and seeing and believing things
that didn't really happen.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.208
Or maybe...

30:31.833 --> 30:34.416
you had an erotic dream about me.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.166
I don't mind being
the object of your desire,

30:37.250 --> 30:40.291
but to go from that
to accusing me of something...

30:41.583 --> 30:43.041
You raped me, Arturo.

30:43.458 --> 30:45.541
You drugged me and you raped me.

30:45.625 --> 30:46.458
Listen to me.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.666
You brat.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.250
I didn't rape you.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.666
I didn't take advantage of you.

30:53.750 --> 30:57.208
You're accusing me
of something really very serious.

30:57.291 --> 30:59.000
Something I loathe.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.333
Something I detest.

31:00.416 --> 31:03.458
I've always been
a defender of women's rights.

31:03.541 --> 31:07.666
I've always advocated respect for women.
I won't allow this.

31:11.125 --> 31:12.166
Nothing happened.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.875
You were scared, you had a panic attack...

31:14.958 --> 31:16.833
It's normal, OK?

31:19.958 --> 31:23.000
Can you believe it?

31:31.958 --> 31:33.291
That's Bogotá.

31:44.583 --> 31:49.583
Now you really are fucked.
It's the shrapnel in your neck.

31:50.083 --> 31:52.041
Brachial plexus.

31:52.958 --> 31:55.333
It controls muscles in your arm...

31:55.583 --> 31:58.708
in your hand... in your shoulder.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.625
You know all that?

32:03.083 --> 32:05.791
-I learn this stuff with the Professor.
-Yeah?

32:08.916 --> 32:10.250
Is it hard to breathe?

32:11.166 --> 32:12.125
That's normal.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.083
It's your diaphragm.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.708
-Tough break.
-Do you want me to release you?

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
If you don't release me, you're dead.

32:27.583 --> 32:28.875
If you release me...

32:31.541 --> 32:32.875
I'll treat your wounds.

32:34.083 --> 32:37.500
I'll undo your hands
so you can remove the shrapnel for me.

32:41.208 --> 32:42.750
But you'll still...

32:44.708 --> 32:46.708
be tied at the neck.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.250
I'll have my back to you,

32:50.791 --> 32:52.833
but I only have to do this...

32:53.875 --> 32:57.500
to blow your clever little head off.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.541
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR
19:45 HOURS

33:04.750 --> 33:06.125
Good morning, everyone.

33:06.208 --> 33:08.000
My name is Luis Prieto.

33:08.250 --> 33:11.458
I'm a colonel
from the National Center of Intelligence.

33:11.541 --> 33:15.291
I stand before you at the request
of the Minister of the Interior

33:15.375 --> 33:20.541
to firmly deny the accusations
about the alleged torture of Aníbal Cortés

33:21.458 --> 33:25.125
and to clear up any doubts
you may have about his arrest.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.041
-Yes, here, please.
-Colonel.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.666
How did Ágata Jiménez, alias Nairobi, die?

33:29.750 --> 33:32.375
We are currently
still gathering information.

33:32.458 --> 33:35.666
All I can say
is that she was killed in a skirmish

33:35.750 --> 33:38.875
with the Bank of Spain's head of security,
who broke free.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.375
Was Cortés illegally arrested in Panama?

33:42.458 --> 33:44.833
The arrest was made legally

33:44.916 --> 33:48.541
in accordance
with an arrest warrant issued by Europol.

33:48.625 --> 33:49.791
-Excuse me.
-You.

33:54.833 --> 33:58.041
No democratic country in the world
respecting the rule of law

33:58.125 --> 33:59.250
would do such a thing.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.125
He claims to have been buried alive.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.750
Do you deny that too?
That he was left to defecate himself?

34:06.833 --> 34:12.750
That they gave him 40 coffees
and cold showers?

34:14.125 --> 34:17.458
Those statements
are as ridiculous as they are grotesque.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.250
<i>Prieto did what the Professor</i>
<i>expected him to:</i>

34:21.333 --> 34:24.458
<i>lie, lie, and lie again.</i>

34:24.541 --> 34:28.333
<i>He did it better than the Professor</i>
<i>could ever have imagined.</i>

34:28.791 --> 34:31.166
<i>With sarcasm and arrogance.</i>

34:31.250 --> 34:33.083
They'll be confident.

34:33.208 --> 34:38.041
They'll be confident because they think
it's our word against theirs.

34:38.125 --> 34:42.958
And that's what will make them drown
in the quicksand of their own dirt.

34:43.041 --> 34:47.458
Because what the CNI
could never imagine...

34:49.333 --> 34:51.416
is that our intelligence could be better.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.250
But we'll show them.

34:56.875 --> 34:58.791
We're going to show them...

35:02.833 --> 35:04.291
because we'll be there.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.958
This is the same old
conspiracy theory as always:

35:23.041 --> 35:25.041
that the police use torture.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
We won't accept this kind of talk.

35:33.000 --> 35:33.875
Talk.

35:37.416 --> 35:41.833
We tortured Aníbal Cortés
for around two months.

35:41.916 --> 35:44.833
<i>We were paid 200,000 euros to do it,</i>

35:44.916 --> 35:47.791
<i>by Colonel Prieto</i>
<i>from Spanish Intelligence.</i>

35:47.875 --> 35:50.666
<i>And that was his third missile.</i>

35:50.750 --> 35:51.666
Colonel Prieto.

35:51.750 --> 35:52.833
Excuse me.

35:52.916 --> 35:57.875
We're receiving documentary evidence
that contradicts your words.

35:57.958 --> 36:00.833
Do you know a Turkish citizen named Osman?

36:01.583 --> 36:03.166
I don't know who that is.

36:03.833 --> 36:07.583
This e-mail sent from your account
to this Osman

36:07.666 --> 36:09.500
in which you order,

36:09.583 --> 36:12.958
"Use any means necessary
to obtain the information."

36:13.041 --> 36:15.625
-Did you send this?
-I don't know what you mean.

36:18.083 --> 36:20.708
Maybe these images
will refresh your memory.

36:21.708 --> 36:24.750
<i>This is</i>
<i>where we buried Aníbal Cortés alive.</i>

36:24.833 --> 36:26.458
You can see the wooden box.

36:26.541 --> 36:29.208
We had him in there
for two or three hours.

36:29.416 --> 36:31.500
He dug the hole himself.

36:32.041 --> 36:34.125
Do you deny this evidence too?

36:34.833 --> 36:39.750
Do you still claim that this grave
in a place called Timimoun, in Algeria,

36:39.833 --> 36:43.250
that you refer to in several e-mails,
is a setup?

36:43.333 --> 36:44.958
Of course it is.

36:45.041 --> 36:46.750
Colonel, please.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.250
Colonel, here, please.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.833
I have nothing more to say.

36:55.625 --> 36:59.000
Tamayo will be like a tennis player
in the middle of the court,

36:59.083 --> 37:03.958
trying to return all the balls
that a machine is firing at him nonstop.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.416
<i>They put me in a box.</i>

37:11.291 --> 37:13.250
<i>...€200,000 to do it.</i>

37:13.333 --> 37:16.791
He'll be so focused
on stopping the balls we're firing

37:16.875 --> 37:21.083
that he won't have the time or energy
to think about the heist.

37:21.166 --> 37:24.125
<i>Because his whole world</i>
<i>will be falling apart.</i>

37:24.208 --> 37:26.458
We're ready to resume the attack.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.625
-We're not attacking.
-Colonel!

37:28.708 --> 37:32.583
Can't you see what's happening?
They want to take us all down.

37:32.958 --> 37:37.000
The finishing touch
would be killing a hostage on our way in.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.958
-They're weakened.
-No, it's out of the question.

37:40.041 --> 37:43.416
Do I have to remind you
that you've tried to go in 4 times?

37:43.500 --> 37:45.958
What's going on in there?
Is there an open bar?

37:46.041 --> 37:51.666
When you have a fire of such magnitude,
you can only think about one thing.

37:51.833 --> 37:55.208
-Putting it out.
-Putting it out.

37:55.291 --> 37:59.416
Not for Spain's credibility,
nor for the integrity of the CNI...

38:00.833 --> 38:02.500
but for your own freedom.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.500
Listen, everyone.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.791
I need all non-essential personnel
to step outside.

38:07.875 --> 38:11.541
Take a breather, have a coffee,
and back to work in 5 minutes.

38:17.541 --> 38:19.416
Oh, Alicia...

38:20.375 --> 38:22.625
We tried to get out there and deny it,

38:24.166 --> 38:28.708
but that son of a bitch, the Professor,
was waiting with the evidence in hand.

38:31.041 --> 38:33.791
Now the only way out is to take the blame.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.625
And who's going to do that?

38:37.375 --> 38:39.125
For the CNI, Prieto.

38:42.958 --> 38:44.541
For the police, you.

38:46.625 --> 38:50.791
We need you to create a firewall
so the institutions come out clean.

38:56.416 --> 38:57.708
What should I say?

38:58.625 --> 39:01.166
That I did it all without telling anyone?

39:01.541 --> 39:05.041
That I did it...
out of professional ambition?

39:05.875 --> 39:08.916
To see if they'd give me
the police medal of merit?

39:09.541 --> 39:12.708
They have Prieto's e-mails.
I'm sure they have yours.

39:13.791 --> 39:16.416
You have to resign,
leave the negotiations...

39:17.291 --> 39:21.583
and take the blame for acting illegally.

39:21.708 --> 39:26.208
If I'm taking the blame,
why don't you add that I killed Manolete,

39:26.291 --> 39:29.041
the Kennedy thing,
the attempted coup in '81...

39:29.583 --> 39:31.166
shooting the pope...

39:31.666 --> 39:33.958
I'm getting blamed for it all, right?

39:34.041 --> 39:37.000
You're going to take the rap anyway,

39:37.375 --> 39:40.458
but if you help us,
we won't leave you hanging.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.708
I'll have the CNI discredit the evidence.

39:43.791 --> 39:47.041
The state attorney
and the prosecution are on our side.

39:47.125 --> 39:49.458
You'll get a friendly judge.

39:50.041 --> 39:54.291
Someone who we've got by the balls.
You'll be suspended without pay.

39:54.375 --> 39:58.291
But don't worry,
you'll be paid from reserve funds.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.458
I promise you won't set foot in prison.

40:05.541 --> 40:06.958
I don't care about that.

40:14.583 --> 40:15.458
Well.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.416
It's not like I have much choice.

40:21.583 --> 40:22.416
Right?

40:23.916 --> 40:24.875
Alicia...

40:25.958 --> 40:26.791
be strong.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.708
We're with you.

40:41.833 --> 40:45.500
Sierra... and Colonel Prieto.

40:47.291 --> 40:50.500
They will be the first to fall.

40:51.083 --> 40:51.916
Why?

40:52.875 --> 40:55.375
Because that's how
we'll paralyze the tent,

40:55.458 --> 40:58.416
and by doing so,
protect our crew inside the bank.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.333
Tamayo will have difficulty
maintaining control.

41:01.416 --> 41:05.375
Once everyone in the bank is protected,
what do we do, Benjamín?

41:05.458 --> 41:08.583
Huh? Well... you tell me.

41:09.291 --> 41:13.041
Rescue another member of the gang.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.541
We're going to rescue someone

41:17.000 --> 41:20.166
who is being guarded
by a group of 26 police officers.

41:20.250 --> 41:22.000
That's impossible, Professor.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.333
It's almost impossible,

41:25.416 --> 41:28.500
but there is a possibility

41:29.041 --> 41:30.750
if you know these details:

41:31.500 --> 41:35.666
where they are going to take her
and when.

41:35.750 --> 41:38.750
And we will know that information...

41:40.791 --> 41:43.291
because I'll make them transfer her.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.916
Now just the one in your neck.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.041
How's it look?

42:40.666 --> 42:46.083
It doesn't look good.
If I do it wrong, you could be paralyzed.

42:46.750 --> 42:49.666
Pull it out.
Pull upwards, without hesitation.

42:58.666 --> 43:00.666
Put your head down a bit.

43:04.666 --> 43:05.750
The camera.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.083
For fuck's sake, Gandía's dead!

43:29.166 --> 43:31.916
Bogotá, Tokyo killed Gandía!
Knock the door down!

43:32.458 --> 43:33.375
Fuck!

43:35.583 --> 43:37.583
<i>Then came the fourth missile.</i>

43:40.500 --> 43:42.916
Look at the screens.
Is that the Professor?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.583
Is that the Professor?

43:49.041 --> 43:52.041
Our colleague Lisbon
has been illegally detained.

43:52.208 --> 43:56.250
She was captured and is being held
at the command post in front of the bank.

43:56.833 --> 43:58.833
Without a judge being informed.

43:59.750 --> 44:02.291
<i>-With no right to a defense.</i>
-What the hell?

44:02.375 --> 44:04.916
<i>And after the police faked her execution.</i>

44:05.500 --> 44:06.791
<i>Here's the proof.</i>

44:07.541 --> 44:09.250
<i>The recording of that moment.</i>

44:09.833 --> 44:11.416
<i>Suárez, put down the gun.</i>

44:11.875 --> 44:13.208
<i>Where's the Professor?</i>

44:13.291 --> 44:15.916
<i>Tell them I'll surrender.</i>
<i>Buy time.</i>

44:16.541 --> 44:17.541
<i>Raquel, tell him.</i>

44:17.625 --> 44:20.291
<i>-Where's the Professor?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

44:20.375 --> 44:22.375
<i>Tell him, I'm on my way. Raquel!</i>

44:22.458 --> 44:24.708
<i>-Where's the Professor?</i>
<i>-</i>I don't know!

44:24.791 --> 44:25.666
<i>Get them out.</i>

44:26.208 --> 44:28.666
<i>Get out of there!</i>

44:28.750 --> 44:30.583
I don't know where he is.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.375
Wrong answer.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.375
<i>I'm on my way. Get out of there.</i>

44:34.458 --> 44:35.916
Get out of there!

44:39.500 --> 44:41.166
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

44:41.625 --> 44:44.500
<i>Do you understand, Solana? She shot first.</i>

44:45.166 --> 44:48.125
<i>Take the gun, clean the prints,</i>
<i>put it in her hand.</i>

44:50.000 --> 44:52.375
I implore the authorities to investigate

44:52.791 --> 44:55.291
and to confirm
the accuracy of these facts.

45:07.583 --> 45:10.041
Tied up, and you still took him out.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.125
Great. See if he has a pulse.

45:12.208 --> 45:13.791
Yes, I have a pulse.

45:14.041 --> 45:16.500
Sorry, you're more interested in Gandía.

45:17.291 --> 45:19.666
There he is.
A bit under the weather.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.750
-He's alive.
-Good.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.208
Are you going to untie me?

45:29.875 --> 45:30.791
How are you?

45:56.625 --> 45:57.875
How's Nairobi?

46:34.208 --> 46:38.125
<i>The last missile</i>
<i>arrived at the tent in an official car,</i>

46:38.208 --> 46:41.208
<i>with a badge and a judge's order.</i>

46:41.708 --> 46:42.583
Attention.

46:44.250 --> 46:45.625
Stop what you're doing.

46:49.541 --> 46:52.583
-I'm Colonel Tamayo. I'm in charge.
-I don't care.

46:52.666 --> 46:54.208
Internal Affairs Unit.

46:54.291 --> 46:57.791
-What's going on?
-Where's Raquel Murillo being held?

47:12.958 --> 47:14.041
Raquel Murillo,

47:14.333 --> 47:17.708
you're under arrest for the crimes
of belonging to an armed group,

47:17.791 --> 47:21.750
abduction, attacking an officer
and the institutions of the state.

47:22.375 --> 47:24.500
You have the right to remain silent.

47:24.791 --> 47:27.875
You have the right
to an attorney of your choice.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.000
You have the right to medical care.

47:31.333 --> 47:33.333
You have the right to make a call.
