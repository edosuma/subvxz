00:02.210 --> 00:03.753
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.922
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.299
- I THINK WE JUST POLISHED OFF
AN ENTIRE BOX OF WINE.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.927
- MM, SEE THAT'S THE DANGEROUS
THING ABOUT BOXED WINE.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.096
YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL HOW MUCH
YOU'VE DRANKEN.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.723
DRINKEN.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.891
DRUNKEN?
- DRUNK?

00:16.975 --> 00:19.144
- LITTLE BIT.
[laughter]

00:19.227 --> 00:20.478
SO CUYAHOGA RIVER WINE

00:20.562 --> 00:23.440
WANTS US TO MAKE
BOXED WINE CLASSY.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.482
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED IS

00:24.566 --> 00:26.067
SOME SNOOTY CELEBRITY
TO ENDORSE IT.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.777
- OH, I BET VICTORIA
WOULD DO IT.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.612
GOD KNOWS SHE'S NEVER
SAID NO TO WINE.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
- SHE'D BE GOOD.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.115
HEY, HOW'S HER WOODY ALLEN
MOVIE GOING?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.783

- YUP.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.495
- I LOVE THAT GUY!

00:37.579 --> 00:38.663
HE'S, LIKE, MY FAVORITE ACTOR!

00:38.747 --> 00:40.290
THEY CALL HIM
"THE ACTOR'S ACTOR"!

00:40.373 --> 00:43.334
WHY AM I YELLING?
- [laughs]

00:43.418 --> 00:46.129
- MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL THIS
"THE WINE'S WINE."

00:46.212 --> 00:47.130
- HMM.
- [gasps]

00:47.213 --> 00:49.299
OR WE COULD DO AN L.A. TRICK.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.010
SLAP A BLACK LABEL ON IT,
JACK UP THE PRICE,

00:52.093 --> 00:54.012
AND CREATE
AN ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.638
PEOPLE GO CRAZY FOR THAT.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.309
- YOU ARE SO SMART.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.144
I'M GLAD CHLOE'S OUT OF TOWN.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.812
THIS IS FUN DOING THIS
WITH YOU.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.565
JUST THE TWO OF US.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.652
[cell phone chimes]

01:09.736 --> 01:11.738
OH, NO.

01:11.821 --> 01:12.655
I FORGOT TO CALL CARMEN.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.115
- OH, CARMEN.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.159
SO YOU'RE STILL DATING
THAT MODEL.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.369
- ACTUALLY, SHE'S A CHEERLEADER
FOR THE CAVS.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.372
- SO SHE'S LIMBER AS WELL.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.874
- LET ME JUST TELL HER
I'LL BE THERE SOON.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.000
- YEAH, NO.
NO PROBLEM.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.877
IT'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SEE

01:25.960 --> 01:27.504
IF I MISSED ANY TEXTS
FROM MY BOYFRIEND.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.549
OH! NO, FIVE.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.176
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE SEEING SOMEONE.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.513
- OH, YEAH, IT'S NEW,
BUT IT'S SUPER SERIOUS.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.348
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

01:38.431 --> 01:40.350
- UM, IT'S--

01:40.433 --> 01:43.394
- UHMIT?
YOU MEAN, EMMET?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.188
LIKE, EMMET LAWSON?

01:45.271 --> 01:49.025
- EXACTLY LIKE EMMET LAWSON.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.194
- YOU'RE DATING EMMET LAWSON?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.362
WHY WOULDN'T YOU MENTION THAT

01:52.445 --> 01:54.030
WHEN WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT HIM?

01:54.113 --> 01:56.991
- BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
TO KISS AND TELL.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.701
AND WE HAVE DONE
A LOT OF KISSIN',

01:58.785 --> 02:01.162
LET ME TELL YA.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.372
- OH, MY GOD.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.373
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD ASK HIM

02:03.456 --> 02:04.374
TO REPRESENT THE WINE?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.708
- OF COURSE I CAN ASK HIM.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.835
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.877
I ASK HIM QUESTIONS
ALL THE TIME.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.880
- WOW.
EMMET LAWSON.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.507
YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.508
- YEAH.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.886
SOMETIMES I SURPRISE MYSELF.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.597
- YOU TOLD HIM WHAT?

02:19.681 --> 02:22.058
- I WAS DRUNK.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.393
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT ALEC.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.144
EVERY TIME HE BRINGS UP CARMEN,

02:25.228 --> 02:27.063
I GET ALL
JEALOUS AND PANICKY,

02:27.146 --> 02:28.314
AND I JUST WANT
TO ONE-UP HIM.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.567
SO DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD TALK TO EMMET?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.235
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT ENDORSING THE WINE?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.903
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.405
I HAVEN'T EVEN MET HIM YET.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.407
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY
NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.578
HE IS
THE ACTOR'S ACTOR'S ACTOR.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.580
- I THINK YOU ADDED AN ACTOR.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.415
- NO, NO.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.250
HE'S THE MOST RESPECTED ACTOR
AMONG ACTOR'S ACTORS.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.460
HE IS THAT GOOD.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.380
DID YOU KNOW THAT BEFORE HE SHOT
<i>WHITE FANG,</i>

02:52.463 --> 02:55.383
HE ACTUALLY LIVED WITH A PACK
OF WOLVES FOR TWO MONTHS?

02:55.466 --> 02:59.554
- WELL, THAT'S NUTS.
- NO, THAT'S METHOD.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.264
THERE IS NO WAY THAT
I'M GOING TO ASK

03:01.347 --> 03:05.101
AN ACTOR OF HIS CALIBER TO SELL
SOME CHEAP BOXED WINE.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.394
- IT'S NOT CHEAP.

03:06.477 --> 03:10.064
IT'S BLACK LABEL.
LIMITED EDITION.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.067
- REALLY?
WHERE CAN I GET SOME?

03:13.151 --> 03:16.237
- YOU CAN'T.
THEY ONLY MADE 50 CASES.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.908
- I HAVE TO HAVE IT.
I'LL PAY DOUBLE.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.075
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO

03:21.159 --> 03:23.661
<i>IF</i> YOU TALK TO EMMET ABOUT
ENDORSING THE WINE.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.789
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ALEC
THAT YOU ASKED EMMET

03:26.873 --> 03:28.416
AND HE SAID NO?

03:28.499 --> 03:29.834
I MEAN, BOYFRIENDS SAY "NO"
ALL THE TIME.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.796
- MINE DON'T.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.175
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.639
[cell phone rings]

03:42.722 --> 03:45.141
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

03:45.224 --> 03:49.145
CALL ME ON THE DISPOSABLE.

03:49.228 --> 03:51.773
[cell phone rings]

03:51.856 --> 03:54.192
HELLO, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.115
- DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO

04:01.199 --> 04:02.659
WITH THAT MONEY
JOY SAW?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.203
- "ALLEGEDLY" SAW...

04:05.286 --> 04:09.165
WHEN SHE WAS STUDYING.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.167
- MORNING.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.336
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

04:13.419 --> 04:17.382
I WENT SHOPPING
AT FOREVER 21.

04:17.464 --> 04:22.011
- I'M GUESSING
THE MENOPAUSE BARN WAS CLOSED?

04:25.556 --> 04:27.850
- I KNOW SOMEHOW YOU'RE FITTING
INTO SCHOOL

04:27.934 --> 04:29.519
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
YOUR LOOK

04:29.602 --> 04:32.855
SINCE THE INVENTION
OF THE BEDAZZLER.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.899
BUT I'M GOING FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE COLLEGIATE.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.234
I JUST WANT TO BLEND IN.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.360
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO LOOK AT ME

04:37.443 --> 04:39.237
AND THINK,
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.530
- I'M LOOKING AT YOU
AND THINKING

04:40.613 --> 04:43.491
WHY IS SHE WEARING
THAT HIDEOUS PURSE?

04:43.574 --> 04:44.867
- IT'S NOT A PURSE.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.536
NOBODY AT SCHOOL
CARRIES PURSES ANYMORE.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.038
THIS IS A MESSENGER BAG.
- HMM.

04:49.122 --> 04:53.960
- WHAT DO YOU CARRY IN THERE?
- MY PURSE.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.803
[knock on door]

05:04.971 --> 05:07.682
- VICTORIA CHASE.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.101
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.
I AM--

05:10.184 --> 05:12.520
- SIR EMMET LAWSON.
- AT YOUR SERVICE.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.111
{\an8}AS SOON AS I SAW YOUR NAME
ON THE CALL SHEET,

05:20.194 --> 05:21.738
{\an8}I RUSHED OVER
TO SAY HELLO

05:21.821 --> 05:23.906
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M A HUGE FAN
OF YOUR WORK.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.616
{\an8}- OH.
I AM HUGELY THRILLED

05:25.700 --> 05:28.661
{\an8}THAT ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST
CELEBRATED ACTORS

05:28.745 --> 05:31.581
{\an8}ACTUALLY WATCHED MY LITTLE EMMY
AWARD-WINNING PERFORMANCE

05:31.664 --> 05:33.750
{\an8}ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

05:33.833 --> 05:35.168
{\an8}- ACTUALLY,
I WAS REFERRING

05:35.251 --> 05:37.795
{\an8}TO YOUR MANY LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIES.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.717
{\an8}<i>PAGEANT MOM MURDER,</i>
<i>THE TWO MRS. FINKLESTEINS,</i>

05:42.800 --> 05:46.554
{\an8}<i>A KIDNEY FOR SISTER SARAH.</i>

05:46.637 --> 05:49.223
{\an8}EVERY ONE, A PRECIOUS JEWEL.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.267
{\an8}- WELL, I AM JUST THRILLED

05:51.350 --> 05:54.604
{\an8}THAT WE GET TO PLAY TOGETHER
AND WITH WOODY ALLEN.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.647
{\an8}- BUT WHAT IF
IT'S ONE OF HIS BAD ONES?

05:56.731 --> 06:00.735
{\an8}<i>MELINDA AND MELINDA?</i>
NO, THANK YOU. NO, THANK YOU.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.279
{\an8}- IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE BAD
IF WE'RE IN IT.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.490
{\an8}- EXCELLENT POINT.

06:05.573 --> 06:09.077
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE YOU AND I
ARE GOING

06:09.160 --> 06:12.747
{\an8}TO BECOME GREAT FRIENDS.

06:17.418 --> 06:21.631
- WOULD YOU WEAR THIS?

06:21.714 --> 06:23.132
- I MIGHT TIE IT AROUND
MY FINGER

06:23.216 --> 06:25.051
IF I NEEDED TO REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.180
- IT'S A GIFT FOR CARMEN.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.473
WE'RE HEADED TO COZUMEL
FOR A LONG WEEKEND.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.475
- REALLY?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.352
WELL, UH, ME AND EMMET
ARE GOING AWAY

06:34.435 --> 06:35.978
FOR THE LONG WEEKEND TOO.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.355
ONLY WE'RE NOT GONNA
NEED BATHING SUITS

06:37.438 --> 06:40.441
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE NAKED.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.443
SO NAKED.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.861
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

06:43.945 --> 06:46.864
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.951
- HEY, UM, LISTEN.
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT...

06:50.034 --> 06:50.827
I KNOW WE'D BEEN DRINKING,

06:50.910 --> 06:52.870
AND WE WERE HAVING FUN--
A LOT OF FUN.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.665
- MM-HMM.
- BUT I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.834
I DON'T THINK I WAS BEING
ENTIRELY PROFESSIONAL.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.003
I MEAN, WE'RE BOTH
IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.505
RIGHT?

07:02.588 --> 07:03.840
- RIGHT.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.008
BIG TIME.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.009
- SO WE'RE GOOD?

07:07.093 --> 07:08.344
- YEAH.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.346
- OH, HEY.

07:10.429 --> 07:11.681
WHAT DID EMMET SAY ABOUT
ENDORSING THE WINE?

07:11.764 --> 07:14.100
- OH, YEAH.
I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID NO.

07:14.183 --> 07:18.020
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES BOYFRIENDS
SAY "NO."

07:18.104 --> 07:19.981
- HEY, WHAT IF YOU BROUGHT HIM
BY HERE FOR LUNCH?

07:20.064 --> 07:22.024
I KNOW I COULD PERSUADE HIM.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.526
I MEAN, NOT TO BRAG,
BUT PEOPLE HAVE

07:23.609 --> 07:25.027
A HARD TIME SAYING NO TO ME.

07:25.111 --> 07:25.736
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.698
- OKAY.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.782
- OKAY.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.412
- I DID IT AGAIN.

07:34.495 --> 07:37.373
I TOLD ALEC THAT I WOULD BRING
EMMET BY FOR LUNCH.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.709
- WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.377
- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST LIKE HIM SO MUCH

07:41.460 --> 07:46.257
I CAN'T HELP BUT LIE TO HIM.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.593
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
- YEAH, YEAH, I DO.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.179
AND ACTUALLY,
I MIGHT BE ABLE

07:51.262 --> 07:52.680
TO TALK TO EMMET
FOR YOU.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.390
IT TURNS OUT THAT
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.059
HE'S A HUGE FAN OF MY WORK.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.770
- [laughs]
WHY?

07:59.854 --> 08:02.398
I MEAN, GREAT.
NOT SURPRISING AT ALL.

08:02.481 --> 08:06.694
SO NOT SHOCKED.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.404
- I HATE SCHOOL,
AND I'M NEVER GOING BACK,

08:08.487 --> 08:10.990
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.242
- HONEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.411
- NO ONE MAKES ANY ATTEMPT
TO TALK TO ME

08:15.494 --> 08:17.288
OR ACKNOWLEDGE MY EXISTENCE.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.583
THEY'RE ALL SO COOL WITH THEIR
PIERCINGS AND TATTOOS.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.918
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT ELKA.

08:22.001 --> 08:26.756
- SHE'S ONE OF THE MEAN GIRLS.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.549
I SAW HER WITH
HER STUDY GROUP FRIENDS,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
AND THEY TOTALLY SNUBBED ME.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.969
- NOW, JOY,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU

08:32.053 --> 08:33.261
WHAT I USED TO TELL MY KIDS

08:33.346 --> 08:35.264
WHEN THEY HAD A PROBLEM
LIKE THIS.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.475
TALK TO YOUR THERAPIST,
MOMMY'S IN A MOVIE.

08:40.519 --> 08:41.604
- [knock on door]
VICTORIA.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.855
- OH, IT'S EMMET.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.774
WE JUST GOT OUR SCRIPT,

08:44.857 --> 08:46.234
AND I ASKED HIM TO COME BY
TO RUN LINES.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.986
- YOU CALL FOR ME?
- OH, SIR EMMET LAWSON. HELLO.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.821
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIENDS--

08:50.905 --> 08:53.115
- WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
IN THE SAME TRAILER AS YOU,

08:53.199 --> 08:56.953
LET ALONE THE SAME UNIVERSE?

08:57.036 --> 08:57.954
- I'M SORRY?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.622
- YOU'RE SORRY?
TYPICAL.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.624
YOU'RE ALWAYS SORRY,
AREN'T YOU?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.627
WELL, I'M SORRY
I EVER MET YOU.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.254
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.298
- NO.
YOU NEVER DO.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.634
[door slams]

09:12.718 --> 09:14.220
- WHAT WAS THAT?

09:14.303 --> 09:16.138
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:16.222 --> 09:20.309
- YOU DIDN'T ASK HIM
ABOUT LUNCH.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.609
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.361
THIS MORNING
HE WAS MY BIGGEST FAN

09:30.444 --> 09:32.029
AND NOW HE HATES ME.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.657
- WHAT'S ODD IS HE SAID
YOU "ALWAYS" DO THIS.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.158
HOW COULD YOU "ALWAYS"
DO ANYTHING

09:36.242 --> 09:37.201
IF YOU'VE ONLY JUST MET HIM?

09:37.285 --> 09:38.828
- I DON'T KNOW,
AND I HAVE NO IDEA

09:38.911 --> 09:41.038
WHY HE'S ACTING THIS WAY.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.791
ACTING.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.794
IN THE SCRIPT HE'S
MY EX-HUSBAND, WHO HATES ME.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.463
NOW, MAYBE HE'S DOING THAT
WHOLE METHOD ACTING THING,

09:49.547 --> 09:51.215
AND HE'S JUST TREATING ME
LIKE HIS EX-WIFE.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.342
- OH, OF COURSE.
- THAT'S IT.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.553
- YEAH, BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT?

09:55.636 --> 09:57.513
WHAT IF HE JUST HATES ME?

09:57.596 --> 09:59.849
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THE NEXT
THREE MONTHS NOT KNOWING.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.267
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

10:01.350 --> 10:04.478
UNLESS WOODY MAGICALLY DECIDES
TO REWRITE THE MOVIE

10:04.562 --> 10:06.689
AND TURNS YOUR CHARACTERS
INTO A LOVING COUPLE.

10:08.607 --> 10:12.153
- INTERESTING.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.155
- I WAS SAYING THAT
AS AN EXAMPLE

10:14.238 --> 10:15.823
OF SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:15.906 --> 10:16.824
- YEAH, BUT--

10:16.907 --> 10:18.659
BUT WHAT IF I WROTE A SCENE

10:18.743 --> 10:19.910
WHERE OUR CHARACTERS GET ALONG

10:19.994 --> 10:21.370
AND I SLIPPED IT
INTO EMMET'S SCRIPT

10:21.454 --> 10:23.497
AND THAT WAY I'LL FIND OUT
IF HE HATES ME

10:23.581 --> 10:25.207
OR IF HE'S JUST BEING METHOD.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.335
AND ONCE I FIND OUT,

10:27.418 --> 10:29.420
THEN I JUST MAKE THE IMPROVED
SCRIPT GO AWAY.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.714
- REALLY?
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING

10:31.797 --> 10:35.384
REWRITING WOODY ALLEN?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.179
- SHE ALREADY REFERRED TO IT
AS AN "IMPROVED" SCENE.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.056
- IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
IN THE MOVIE.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.184
ALTHOUGH ONE NEVER KNOWS.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.102
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO WRITE?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.228
- WELL, OF COURSE.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.232
YOU FORGET I WAS MARRIED
TO AARON SORKIN'S COUSIN.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.904
AND I WROTE
MY OWN WIKIPEDIA BIO.

10:54.987 --> 10:58.366
AND I JUST PUT A PENCIL
BEHIND MY EAR.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.788
- WERE ANY OF THOSE A "YES?"

11:05.498 --> 11:07.750
[laughter]

11:07.833 --> 11:09.251
- OH.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.087
HI, JOY.
[door closes]

11:11.170 --> 11:14.590
- HI.
JOY SCROGGS.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.427
FROM ECONOMICS.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.970
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

11:20.054 --> 11:22.264
- JUST CHILLAXIN'.
KEEPING IT REAL.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.559
GETTIN' MY HOMEWORK ON.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.146
- OH, GEEZ.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.775
- SO...WHAT WERE YOU
LAUGHING ABOUT?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.902
- ELKA SAYS THERE'S SOME GIRL
WHO CARRIES A PURSE

11:34.985 --> 11:36.320
INSIDE HER MESSENGER BAG.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.786
- OH, HOW SAD AND RANDOM.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.455
IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.748
WHOO.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.667
- WHAT'S ON YOUR NECK?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.711
- OH, THIS?
I JUST GOT INKED.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.296
- YOU GOT A TATTOO?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.215
- IT'S OOZING PUS.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.970
- SPIDER SAID THERE MIGHT BE
SOME WEEPING.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.471
- IT'S PRETTY GROSS.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.098
YOU HAVE TO KEEP DISINFECTANT
ON IT.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.182
THE SAME THING HAPPENED

12:05.266 --> 12:07.351
WHEN MY MOM GOT
HER MID-LIFE TATTOO.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.981
DID YOU JUST TURN 50?

12:12.064 --> 12:15.192
- NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE
SOME WEEPING.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.155
[voice mail beeps]

12:19.238 --> 12:21.157
- HEY, MELANIE.
IT'S ME.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
OUR EXPERIMENT DIDN'T WORK.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.161
I DROPPED OFF THE FAKE SCENE,

12:25.244 --> 12:27.121
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN EMMET
ALL DAY.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.789
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST TELL ALEC

12:28.873 --> 12:30.958
THAT YOU AND EMMET BROKE UP.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.042
[knock on door]

12:33.711 --> 12:35.004
- VICTORIA.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.173
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.216
[door closes]
- REALLY? YOU ARE?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.843
OH, DID--DID YOU GET
THE NEW SCENE?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.845
- I DID WHICH IS WHY
I'M QUITTING THE MOVIE.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.847
- WHAT?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.850
- IT'S HANDS DOWN
THE WORST THING I'VE EVER READ.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.477
RIFE WITH SPELLING ERRORS,

12:49.560 --> 12:50.811
MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.897
DEFINITELY ONE OF WOODY'S
BAD ONES.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.565
- I THOUGHT THE SCENE WAS QUITE
BRILLIANT.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.900
- BOLLOCKS.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.651
IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN
THAT PLAY

12:57.735 --> 12:59.361
AARON SORKIN'S COUSIN WROTE.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.322
NO.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.698
WOODY'S OBVIOUSLY LOST IT.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.159
I SUGGEST YOU CALL YOUR AGENT
AND GET OFF THIS MOVIE

13:05.242 --> 13:06.160
BEFORE YOU GET FIRED.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.286
- FIRED?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.079
- THE SCENE CALLS
FOR YOUR ROLE

13:09.163 --> 13:11.707
TO BE PLAYED BY
A STUNNING 30-SOMETHING.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.626
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S GOING
TO RECAST YOU.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.505
- I COULD PASS
FOR 30-SOMETHING.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.548
- OH, SWEET VICTORIA.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.551
I'M SO PLEASED YOU HAVEN'T LOST
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR

13:22.635 --> 13:23.886
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.430
I BID YOU ADIEU.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.015
[kiss]

13:28.098 --> 13:31.560
I'M SURE OUR PATHS
WILL CROSS AGAIN.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.438
- WAIT!

13:34.522 --> 13:35.898
I WROTE THAT SCENE.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.900
- COME AGAIN?

13:37.983 --> 13:41.403
- BEING ON THIS MOVIE IS
A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.280
I HAVE SUCH ENORMOUS RESPECT
FOR YOU,

13:43.364 --> 13:45.741
AND I'M JUST VERY INSECURE

13:45.824 --> 13:48.369
ABOUT WORKING WITH AN ACTOR
OF YOUR CALIBER.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.328
AND I-I JUST NEEDED
TO KNOW THAT

13:49.411 --> 13:52.248
IT WASN'T YOU HATING ME,
IT WAS THE METHOD.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.252
- YOU DARLING LITTLE LUNATIC.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.378
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU WON'T QUIT.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.546
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU WON'T WRITE.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.256
- DEAL.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.925
AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK INTO CHARACTER,

14:03.008 --> 14:05.928
AND I PROMISE THAT I WON'T TAKE
IT PERSONALLY.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.138
- WELL, WE'LL SEE
IF I CAN'T ADJUST MY METHODS

14:08.222 --> 14:09.723
SO I'M NOT QUITE SO GRUFF,
HMM?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.309
- THANK YOU.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.229
- IT'S JUST FEAR, YOU KNOW.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.273
THE WHOLE IMMERSING MYSELF
INTO THE CHARACTER THING.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.732
THAT WAY,
IF THE PERFORMANCE FAILS,

14:18.816 --> 14:21.777
IT'S THE CHARACTER'S FAULT,
NOT MY OWN.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.988
- THAT IS SO HONEST.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.739
AND DEEP.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.825
- I KNOW.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
BUT BECAUSE OF THAT,

14:29.326 --> 14:30.286
I'M OFTEN LABELED AS DIFFICULT.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.453
- I UNDERSTAND.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.248
PEOPLE SAY THAT
I'M DIFFICULT TOO.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.418
BUT BEYOND MY HYSTERICAL DEMANDS
FOR A LARGER TRAILER,

14:37.501 --> 14:40.629
I'M JUST A LITTLE GIRL LOOKING
FOR LOVE.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.381
- THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.925
YOU KNOW,

14:45.009 --> 14:46.802
I BELIEVE YOU AND I
ARE TWO SIDES

14:46.885 --> 14:48.304
OF THE SAME COIN.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.391
A VERY RARE
AND BEAUTIFUL COIN.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.943
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE OUT THERE

15:03.027 --> 15:04.987
HAVING A NICE LAUGH ABOUT ME
RIGHT NOW.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.115
- LOOK, YOU'RE AT AN AWKWARD
AGE FOR COLLEGE.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.116
THAT'S ALL.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.326
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.327
THEY ALL LOVE YOU.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
- BECAUSE I'M 90.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.331
I'M A NOVELTY.

15:15.414 --> 15:20.044
I'M ALSO GENUINELY COOL.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.338
- AND I'M THEIR MUM'S AGE.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.632
NO ONE WANTS THEIR MUM
HANGING OUT WITH THEM,

15:24.715 --> 15:26.216
OR WORSE, ACTING LIKE THEM.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.345
- YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
- OF COURSE NOT.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.013
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
TO ACCEPT

15:31.096 --> 15:33.015
THAT THE SOCIAL PART OF COLLEGE
WON'T BE FOR ME.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.016
- [chuckles]

15:34.099 --> 15:36.018
WELL, YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.355
IN MY DAY,
WE KNEW HOW TO PARTY.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.733
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY LEFT
A MESS AT STONEHENGE.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.112
- THIS IS WHY I CAN'T
BE NICE TO YOU.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.871
- HEY, GUYS.
ZACK TEXTED ME.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.539
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
- [exhales]

15:57.623 --> 15:59.875
HE WANTS ME TO COME TO
HIS DORM ROOM AND HANG OUT.

15:59.958 --> 16:03.587
- IS THIS THE GUY YOU HOOKED UP
WITH A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

16:03.671 --> 16:04.838
WHO NEVER CALLED BACK?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.549
- YES.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.219
YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

16:10.302 --> 16:12.221
HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
SERIOUS AFTER ALL.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.390
- OH, DEAR GOD.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.350
- WHAT?

16:16.433 --> 16:18.519
- LOOK, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS,

16:18.602 --> 16:21.063
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMEONE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING SERIOUS.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.440
THAT'S A BOOTY CALL,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.859
JUST SAYIN'.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.361
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ZACK.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.862
HOW DO I LOOK?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.030
- DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU LOOK.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.573
ZACK WANTS YOU TO COME THERE
AND TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.201
THAT'S HOW
HE WANTS YOU TO LOOK.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.620
IN ECONOMICS, WHEN SOMETHING
IS IN DEMAND,

16:36.704 --> 16:39.039
WHAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY
TO DIMINISH ITS VALUE?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.375
- FLOOD THE MARKET.
- EXACTLY.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.918
AND IF YOU GO OVER
TO ZACH'S DORM

16:43.001 --> 16:44.461
BASED ON
A LET'S-HANG-OUT TEXT,

16:44.545 --> 16:47.381
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA DO TO YOUR VALUE?

16:47.464 --> 16:48.424
- MAKE IT PLUMMET.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.259
- PRECISELY.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.594
IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF KEYNESIAN THEORIES

16:52.678 --> 16:54.430
OF MARKET FUNGIBILITY.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.891
HEY, I UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.937
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

17:02.020 --> 17:04.106
WHAT IF A GUY TELLS YOU
HE CAN'T SEE YOU BECAUSE--

17:04.189 --> 17:05.648
- HE'S LYING.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.233
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

17:07.317 --> 17:08.944
- BECAUSE IF A GUY REALLY WANTS
TO SEE YOU,

17:09.028 --> 17:10.779
HE WILL FIND A WAY
TO SEE YOU.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.613
- WHAT IF A GUY SAID HE WANTS

17:11.696 --> 17:12.781
TO TAKE A BREAK
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

17:12.865 --> 17:13.949
- OH, CUT HIM LOOSE.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.242
HE'S ALREADY BANGING
YOUR ROOMMATE.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.161
NEXT.
[overlapping chatter]

17:17.243 --> 17:18.162
NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.329
ONE AT A TIME,
ONE AT A TIME.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.836
- IS THAT ALL YOU'RE TAKING?

17:25.919 --> 17:27.628
- IT'S A BEACH VACATION.
YOU DON'T NEED MUCH.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.173
- YEAH?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.257
WELL, EMMET AND I AREN'T PACKING
MUCH EITHER

17:30.340 --> 17:33.302
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING
ON AN ALL-NUDE SNOWBOARDING--

17:33.385 --> 17:35.304
UGH, NEVER MIND.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.139
- SO IS EMMET COMING BY?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.807
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I CAME
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.808
SEE, UM,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.810
EMMET AND I BROKE UP.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.147
- MELANIE, MY LOVE!

17:45.230 --> 17:47.816
- E-EMMET LAWSON.
OH, MY GOD.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.778
I MEAN, UH, HELLO.
MY LOVER.

17:50.861 --> 17:55.657
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I DUMPED YOU,
BUDDY.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.993
- MELANIE, MY SWEET.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.287
DON'T BREAK UP
WITH ME, PLEASE.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.664
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE
TO WIN YOUR HEART.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.209
- OKAY.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.002
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
MR. LAWSON.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.712
- OH, PLEASE.
MR. LAWSON IS MY FATHER.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.340
I AM SIR EMMET.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.716
AND YOU MUST BE ALEC,

18:12.800 --> 18:15.552
PURVEYOR OF FINE WINE SERVED
IN CARDBOARD.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.929
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.347
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO TRY OUR WINE.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.264
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.016
- WELL, AS PETER O'TOOLE
ONCE SAID TO ME,

18:21.099 --> 18:22.976
"EMMET, NEVER TURN DOWN FREE--"

18:23.060 --> 18:25.187
AND THEN HE PASSED OUT.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.314
BUT I'M SURE HE WAS GONNA
SAY "WINE."

18:30.400 --> 18:32.861
- [quietly] OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.197
- VICTORIA BROUGHT ME UP
TO SPEED ON THE WHOLE STORY.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.366
- OH, IF HE BRINGS UP
NUDE SNOWBOARDING,

18:37.449 --> 18:39.034
ACT LIKE IT'S A REAL THING.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.536
- I'VE DONE IT.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.371
- REALLY?

18:42.454 --> 18:44.373
- THAT'S ACTING.
- OH.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.376
- SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.086
I AM SUCH A HUGE FAN
OF YOUR WORK.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.547
- AS AM I.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.091
NOW PULL OPEN THE VALVE
ON THAT CARTON

18:54.174 --> 18:57.553
AND LET US DRINK DEEPLY
FROM BACCHUS' TREASURE.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.222
- NOW THE BEAUTY OF
CUYAHOGA RIVER WINE--

19:00.305 --> 19:04.935
- LET'S LET THE WINE
DO THE TALKING.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.604
I LOVE IT.
I WILL ENDORSE THIS WINE.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.481
- THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.733
- THIS IS MY AGENT.
YOU ARE AWARE OF MY FEES.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.235
- I IMAGINE THEY'RE HIGH.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.071
- I WOULDN'T BE BRINGING IT UP
IF THEY WERE LOW.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.072
- THANK YOU.
I'LL CALL HIM.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.115
NOW I HATE TO RUN,

19:18.198 --> 19:21.243
BUT I'VE GOT A PLANE
TO CATCH.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.578
AND--AND LISTEN,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.079
I CAN'T YOU ENOUGH
FOR YOUR TIME.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.539
- ANYTHING FOR MY MELANIE.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.875
I AM A LUCKY MAN,
AREN'T I?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.837
- YOU MOST CERTAINLY ARE.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.592
- THANK YOU!

19:36.675 --> 19:38.260
AND I'M MELANIE BY THE WAY.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.304
- SIR EMMET LAWSON
AT YOUR SERVICE.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.890
- [giggles]
- YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY, HUH?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.016
- OH, YEAH.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.642
AND IT'S REALLY SO STUPID

19:45.726 --> 19:47.561
BECAUSE HE'S TOTALLY INVOLVED
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.604
AND I CAN'T GET HIM OUT
OF MY HEAD.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.897
AND THEN
I COME HERE EVERY DAY,

19:49.980 --> 19:51.648
AND HE'S
ALL I THINK ABOUT.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.734
- I KNOW A LITTLE
OF WHAT YOU SPEAK.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.110
- YOU DO?

19:55.193 --> 19:55.944
- WHEN I SPENT
ALL THOSE MONTHS

19:56.028 --> 19:57.279
LIVING WITH THE WOLVES,

19:57.362 --> 19:59.281
THERE WAS
THIS ONE BLUE-EYED BEAUTY

19:59.364 --> 20:01.658
THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.493
- ONE OF THE WOLVES?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.745
- OF COURSE NOT.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.079
MY COSTAR, CAMERON DIAZ.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.497
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
- HEY.
I SAW YOUR BOSS IN THE HALLWAY.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.753
HE IS CUTE.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.963
- REALLY?
IN--IN THE HALLWAY?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.591
WHEN?
- JUST NOW OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.843
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IF HE HEARD US?

20:19.927 --> 20:23.263
VICTORIA, DO THAT THING WHERE WE
CHECK IF SOMEONE CAN HEAR.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.473
[door closes]

20:24.556 --> 20:25.557
- IF SHE CAN HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING,

20:25.641 --> 20:27.476
I AM TOTALLY SCREWED.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.937
- YOU ARE TOTALLY SCREWED.
