Ray: Well? Well, you

- Krieger: Ooh, hang on a sec? [Ray yells]

00:21.670 --> 00:25.606
- Yeah, touchy thing, bionics. You were saying?
- Ray: Thank you.

00:25.741 --> 00:29.076
- Krieger: No, what were you saying like you meant it?
- Ray: Thank you, Krieger,

00:29.211 --> 00:33.214
- for once again giving me the precious gift of legs.
- Krieger: You're welcome.

00:33.348 --> 00:38.301
Ray: Now, if you will excuse me, I need
to remove my underwear with a blowtorch.

00:38.336 --> 00:42.089
Malory: Ha! Perfect,
this is absolutely perfect.

00:42.224 --> 00:45.259
- Cherlene!
- Cyril: Ow! God! Come on!

00:45.394 --> 00:48.796
- Lana: Seriously, thanks for the deaf baby.
- Malory: Oh, shut up. Cher...

00:48.930 --> 00:53.467
- Cherlene: What?! Goddamn, woman, inside voice!
- Malory: How...

00:53.602 --> 00:58.673
would you, my little country songbird,
like to be on Travis County Limits?

00:58.708 --> 01:01.342
- Cyril: Ooh, is that like Austin City Limits?
- Malory: It's comparable,

01:01.476 --> 01:05.242
- hush. Cherlene?
- Cherlene: I don't know. I guess.

01:05.278 --> 01:10.302
Malory: You... would be wonderful, and
it would be wonderful publicity, and...

01:10.337 --> 01:14.152
- wonderful.
- Cherlene: [groans] All right. When is it?

01:14.211 --> 01:17.552
Malory: Tapes tomorrow night, but we
should leave today. I don't want you

01:17.587 --> 01:19.882
- flying the same day you're performing.
- Cherlene: Oh, don't worry about that.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.680
- Malory: Well, but...
- Cherlene: Because Cherlene don't fly.

01:22.715 --> 01:26.031
Malory: Airplane air is so dry,
plus you're breathing in God knows

01:26.166 --> 01:28.936
what those tuberculars
in coach are... Excuse me?!

01:28.969 --> 01:33.673
- Cherlene: I don't fly.
- Malory: I... but-but I've seen you fly.

01:33.807 --> 01:36.843
- Cherlene: Well, maybe you saw Cheryl fly.
- Lana: In a helicopter, the

01:36.977 --> 01:40.546
- space shuttle...
- Pam: Cyril choke-banged you on a blimp?

01:40.681 --> 01:43.716
- Oh, come on, we were all thinking it.
- Archer: What, how are you all

01:43.851 --> 01:46.819
- so goddamn loud?
- Lana: Could you not find a punch bowl?

01:46.954 --> 01:51.658
Archer: It was too heavy. [loud crashing nearby]
[Woodhouse grunting]

01:53.961 --> 01:57.597
[grunting and crashing continues]

01:59.900 --> 02:03.289
[groans]

02:03.324 --> 02:07.540
Archer: And also too spilly.
Now, what's with all the yelling?

02:07.675 --> 02:10.710
Malory: I booked Cherlene on
Travis County Limits, and...

02:10.844 --> 02:12.724
- Archer: Is that like...?
- Malory: It's comparable!

02:12.751 --> 02:16.335
- But it's tomorrow night and she refuses to fly.
- Archer: Wait, really?

02:16.440 --> 02:19.636
So you've only got 24
hours to drive to Texas?

02:19.720 --> 02:22.486
- Malory: Well, 36 but...
- Archer: But after we get a bus

02:22.485 --> 02:25.892
- and a blocker car it'll be 24, right?
- Malory: What?

02:26.026 --> 02:28.202
- Lana: Oh. Oh, God, no.
- Archer: Yes!

02:28.203 --> 02:29.780
- Lana: Archer?
- Archer: Lana!

02:29.781 --> 02:31.931
Malory: Sterling! What
are you talking about?

02:32.066 --> 02:34.914
- Lana: Smokey and the goddamn Bandit.
- Malory: What?

02:34.950 --> 02:38.805
- Archer: We're going # Eastbound and down! #
- Malory: I will never

02:38.939 --> 02:42.302
understand his idiotic fascination
with all this Burt Reynolds

02:42.337 --> 02:46.135
- Smokey trucker nonsense.
- Lana: I think part of it is because you didn't get him

02:46.157 --> 02:51.317
- that CB McHaul toy truck he wanted for his birthday.
- Malory: Wha...? He was 30!

03:40.831 --> 03:44.470
- can't put a price on free advertising.
- Malory: No, they don't,

- and free this isn't.
- Archer: Exactly. How much are they

03:47.738 --> 03:50.630
- paying Cherlene?
- Malory: It's public television, they don't pay

03:50.643 --> 03:54.477
anything. All they do is suck
money in. They take our taxes...

03:54.612 --> 03:58.775

- Malory: Of pre-tax dollars from pot-taking

03:58.848 --> 04:04.554
Bolshevik lesbian couples! Then PBS mixes
it all in with their huge N.E.A. grants,

04:04.689 --> 04:08.261

Mother, get on the bus.

04:23.808 --> 04:26.117
[tires screeching]

04:26.152 --> 04:29.479
Archer: In the blocker car, duh, if
Cyril didn't just break the stupid axle.

04:29.613 --> 04:32.482
- Malory: The what?
- Lana: Okay, first of all...

04:32.616 --> 04:36.458
- Malory: How much did that cost?
- Archer: Well, again, it's advertising, so...

04:36.493 --> 04:39.223
- Malory: For what?
- Archer: Hmm, I guess Pontiac?

04:39.258 --> 04:41.591

04:41.726 --> 04:45.729
Lana: Well, speaking for the tiny, delicate
life blossoming inside me, nowhere in

04:45.863 --> 04:48.732
- a car with T-tops and a four-barrel.
- Archer: Wha... Who's gonna do

04:48.866 --> 04:52.762
snappy dialogue with me,
underscored by sexual attraction?

04:53.971 --> 04:57.807

<i>- Lana: Damn it, Cyril, slow down!
- Malory: Cyril, do nothing of the sort! </i>

05:12.801 --> 05:16.600
Because if we miss that taping,
I won't be responsible for my actions.

05:16.635 --> 05:18.695
- Lana: Are you ever?
- Malory: She said, single and

05:18.829 --> 05:23.287
- pregnant. Oh, wait.
- Cyril: Can you two please go...

05:23.322 --> 05:27.537
anywhere else? It's bad enough
I have to drive 24 hours straight.

05:27.671 --> 05:31.508
Lana: Well, Krieger said he needed
Ray's help on some sort of project.

05:31.642 --> 05:36.248

- Krieger: It's not supposed to be funny.

05:36.283 --> 05:39.549
Malory: So shut up and drive the damn bus!

05:39.683 --> 05:43.686
Sorry, I'm a bit stressed out about
Cherlene getting a record deal.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.710
- Lana: Right, and your 10 percent of it.
- Malory: Or 50 or whatever.

05:47.745 --> 05:49.426

- Cyril: 50, really?

05:49.427 --> 05:52.549
Lana: Who are you, Colonel Mom Parker?

05:52.550 --> 05:54.631
- Nothing?
- Cyril: Meh.

05:54.765 --> 05:57.867
Malory: And not that I care what any of you
think, about anything, but I lost everything

05:58.002 --> 06:02.873
when the Feds took ISIS, and Ron took
what little I had left, so now I need to

06:02.874 --> 06:07.744
make it back somehow. And I'm not doing
that selling cocaine, thanks to Sterling,

06:07.878 --> 06:12.132
who, unbelievably, is even
worse at this than at spying.

06:12.133 --> 06:15.769

- of how it works.
- Cyril: What? Oh.

06:24.829 --> 06:29.311

- Archer: Ten-ten-four, good buddy.

06:29.346 --> 06:33.884

<i>- Ow! Whose ring is that, the Pope's?!

06:39.321 --> 06:42.836

- Pam: Seriously though, I'm sorry you heard

06:42.871 --> 06:46.883
her say that. That's got to be a real
knee to the old emotional nut sack.

06:47.017 --> 06:50.954
Archer: Well, I guess it would be, if
A: I weren't the world's greatest spy.

06:51.088 --> 06:52.555
- Pam: Eh.
- Archer: Shut up,

06:52.556 --> 06:54.757
and B: If they weren't sitting on a

06:54.892 --> 06:57.132
- hundred pounds of coke.
- Pam: What?!

06:57.247 --> 07:01.698
- Archer: Affirmatory, good buddy!
- Pam: Holy dickburn! So you got a buyer lined up

07:01.832 --> 07:05.935
- in Texas and everything?!
- Archer: Well, not exactly, or at all, but, Pam, come on.

07:06.070 --> 07:09.819
We're talking about Texas.
Somebody, somewhere, wants enough

07:09.918 --> 07:13.042
- cocaine to forget they live there.
- Pam: Yeah, but not 100 pounds.

07:13.177 --> 07:17.530
Archer: Maybe we'll get lucky, find an
entire town that wants to commit suicide.

07:17.982 --> 07:21.918
Pam: Wonder if there's a statewide
database of towns with sucky high school

07:22.052 --> 07:24.921
football teams cross-indexed with
towns a black person just moved to.

07:25.055 --> 07:29.459
- Archer: Jesus, Pam, I was kidding.
- Pam: [laughs] Duh, me too, lickbag.

07:29.494 --> 07:31.707
Archer: Well, but see if there is one, just

07:31.798 --> 07:35.765
- for shits and giggles.
- Pam: Um, so, hey, speaking of...

07:35.900 --> 07:38.739
Archer: The hat fart was
technically a shart? [laughs]

07:40.004 --> 07:44.974

- Lana: In addition to sushi,

08:05.800 --> 08:10.638
booze, and soft cheeses, I'm also
supposed to abstain from bus crashes!

08:10.772 --> 08:14.742
- So stay awake!
- Cyril: I'm trying, but 18 hours?

08:14.876 --> 08:17.636

08:27.027 --> 08:31.480

- Pam: Yeah, and sucking at it.

08:34.297 --> 08:38.917
- Archer: Goddamn it! How long was I out?
- Pam: Like, 12 hours? Five states,

08:39.028 --> 08:41.349
dozen cupcakes, a
bunch of truck stops.

09:19.941 --> 09:23.877
It's a kidnapping, it's
a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!

09:24.012 --> 09:27.614

- Pam: Or definitely. Or whatever.
- Archer: Goddamn it, Pam!

10:03.818 --> 10:06.901
- Pam: I wanted people to like me.
- Archer: People who like you because you have

10:06.919 --> 10:10.991
cocaine aren't people you want as
friends, Pam. And not to sound elitist,

10:11.126 --> 10:14.895
but neither are people who need
a roll of quarters to take a shower!

10:15.030 --> 10:18.999
Pam: It's not just a shower, it's more
communal, like a Japanese onsen, or...

10:19.134 --> 10:23.971
Archer: Wow! I didn't think it was possible,
but I somehow just got even angrier!

10:24.105 --> 10:26.468

more than to shoot back, Pam,

you spit it in some trucker's mouth, too?!

Pam: Okay, so, apparently a big thing
at truck stops is a game called craps.

12:10.212 --> 12:14.047
- Pam: You mad?
- Archer: Give ya three guesses, Pam.

12:14.182 --> 12:19.086
Pam: No?
No? No?

12:19.220 --> 12:22.797
Archer: Wrong, Pam. Although I bet
I'm not as mad as Mother's gonna be

12:22.794 --> 12:25.812
- when I tell her this was all your fault!
- Pam: Aw, come on, Archer,

12:25.847 --> 12:29.843
- don't do that! That's not what good buddies do!
- Archer: Okay, first of all,

12:29.847 --> 12:34.134
- you have wildly misjudged our relationship!
- Lana: Archer!

12:34.269 --> 12:37.068
- Archer: Lana!
- Pam: Yeah, you're one to talk.

12:37.103 --> 12:40.974
- Archer: And you're lucky I don't have my gun!
- Malory: And just why the hell don't you?!

12:41.109 --> 12:44.111
Archer: Yeah, tell them why that is, Pam!

12:44.245 --> 12:48.520
- Pam: Oh, come on, please?
- Archer: I...! [groans]

12:48.548 --> 12:53.086
- I-I didn't think I would need it.
- Cherlene: [gasps] You didn't think?!

12:53.221 --> 12:56.051
Well, it's a good damn thing
I ain't paying you to think!

12:56.052 --> 12:57.938
Archer: Yeah, you're
not actually pay... Ow!

12:57.973 --> 13:01.500
Cherlene: The quite-soon-to-be-number-one
country singer in America?!

13:01.535 --> 13:04.164
And you don't think
I'm a kidnapping risk?!

13:04.299 --> 13:07.968
- Archer: Wait... you do? Ow!
- Lana: Yeah, you know,

13:08.102 --> 13:11.071
I'm with Archer. I think those bikers
just wanted to rob us, or...

13:11.206 --> 13:16.977
Pam: What?! I mean, that's just
absolutely crazy. We have nothing.

13:17.111 --> 13:19.260
Malory: Well, I would
like to revisit this whole

13:19.261 --> 13:22.485
kidnapping idea when we have
more time, but she still has

13:22.500 --> 13:26.853
- a show in two hours and we've still got...
- Cyril: I think about a hundred miles.

13:26.988 --> 13:30.057
Lana: And one extremely flat tire, so...

13:30.191 --> 13:31.625
[screams]

13:31.626 --> 13:35.929
Cherlene: Fix it!
I will be on my tour bus

13:36.064 --> 13:38.926
- putting whiskey and glue inside me.
- Malory: You heard her. Fix it.

13:38.961 --> 13:41.462
Pam: Yeah, you guys chill on the bus.

13:41.540 --> 13:44.972
- I'll help lickbag here change the tire.
- Malory: Oh, my God.

13:45.106 --> 13:49.877
Pam: Sorry, I had to sell it.
Chop-chop! Get the lead out, lickbag!

13:49.942 --> 13:53.181
Archer: [sighs]
And what's with the "lickbag" stuff?

13:53.217 --> 13:57.217
[laughing] It's your CB handle! I told
it to everybody from here to Kentucky!

13:57.352 --> 14:01.989
[clicks tongue]
Good buddy. [chomps]

14:04.236 --> 14:08.940
Archer: [grunting]
Whew! Okay, that's got it.

14:09.074 --> 14:12.710
- Malory: Well, it took you long enough.
- Archer: Yeah, Mother, nine whole minutes

14:12.745 --> 14:15.013
- start to finish, what an incompetent boob.
- Malory: Your words.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.149
- Archer: You know...
- Cherlene: Rrrgh! Can we freaking go already?!

14:18.284 --> 14:22.552
Pam: Yeah, whatcha waiting
for, lickbag? [belches]

14:23.569 --> 14:26.517
[engine accelerating, tires squealing]

14:26.518 --> 14:28.882
[freestyle scatting]

14:28.917 --> 14:32.953
- [clears throat] Ten-four.
- Lana: So, I think we may have a problem.

14:32.988 --> 14:36.423
Archer: Yeah, no shit. I keep waiting
for her to have a heart attack, but...

14:36.458 --> 14:38.069
<i>- Lana: Not Pam.
- Pam: Yay!</i>

14:38.204 --> 14:41.806
<i>- Lana: The cops.
- Pam: Boo.</i>

14:41.941 --> 14:44.175
<i>- Archer: Oh, shit! [siren wailing]
- Lana: Yeah, I'm gonna pull over.</i>

14:44.310 --> 14:47.912
- Malory: No! No! Curtain is in ten minutes!
- Lana: What do you want me to

14:48.047 --> 14:51.015
- do, run from the cops?
- Malory: I want you to take that exit for the venue.

14:51.150 --> 14:54.790
Let Sterling deal with this
in that ridiculous blocker car.

14:54.791 --> 14:57.218
Archer: Yeah, good,
you guys get out of here;

14:57.253 --> 14:59.991
- we'll lure them away and outrun them.
- Pam: In this shit-heap?

15:00.125 --> 15:03.194
- Are you nuts?!
- Archer: Are you? You want them to get

15:03.329 --> 15:07.599
- pulled over with 50 pounds of cocaine?
- All: What?!

15:07.611 --> 15:12.103
- Archer: Or kilos, or whatever.
- Malory: You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus

15:12.238 --> 15:16.439
- without my permission?! Sterling?!
- Lana: You have to press the button.

15:16.474 --> 15:18.042
- Malory: The what?
- Lana: Oh, for... You dated

15:18.177 --> 15:21.112
- Burt Reynolds!
- Pam: They don't have the coke, lickbag!

15:21.247 --> 15:24.949
- We do! Right here in the Trans Am!
- Malory: Oh.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.884
Well, then problem solved.

15:28.187 --> 15:32.090
<i>[sirens wailing]
Archer: So, I have a question.</i>

15:32.224 --> 15:35.193
Pam: I switched the coke in Little Rock,
'cause I was worried that...

15:35.327 --> 15:38.997
Archer: That because of your fat, blabbering
mouth Lana would get caught with it

15:39.131 --> 15:41.149
and have to have her baby in prison?

15:41.150 --> 15:43.167
Or because you were low on cupcakes?!

15:43.302 --> 15:46.995
<i>[tires squealing]
Pam: Does the why really matter?</i>

15:47.647 --> 15:51.042
Cherlene: ♪ Eastbound and down ♪
♪ Loaded up and truckin' ♪

15:51.176 --> 15:54.659
♪ We gonna do what they say can't be done ♪

15:54.660 --> 15:59.466
<i>♪ We got a long way to go ♪
♪ And a short time to get... ♪</i>

15:59.501 --> 16:01.252
Pam: Yeah! Check it out, lickbag!

16:01.387 --> 16:05.189
- Cherlene wrote a song about us.
- Archer: What? She didn't write a...

16:05.324 --> 16:11.129
<i>- That's from Smokey and the... Goddamn it!
- Pam: Oww!</i>

16:11.263 --> 16:14.232
- What the shit, Snidely Whiplash?!
- Archer: Now both of our cars

16:14.366 --> 16:19.211
are messed up!
I just leveled the playing field!

16:19.468 --> 16:23.900
- Pam: Oh, my God, I can't feel my face!
- Archer: Gee, Pam, I wonder if that's got

16:23.935 --> 16:27.815
- anything to do with your cocaine-only diet!
- Pam: Well, it's a small

16:27.850 --> 16:31.149
price to pay for beauty! [gun clicking]
[gunshot]

16:31.283 --> 16:34.285
- Archer: Damn it!
- Pam: Man, and here you are without your gun.

16:34.420 --> 16:38.089
- That's pretty ironic, huh?
- Archer: No, Pam, once again you're confusing

16:38.223 --> 16:40.675
<i>the word ironic with "you are an idiot".</i>

16:40.676 --> 16:43.127
What's ironic is that every other store

16:43.262 --> 16:48.032
- we drive by is a gun shop!
- Pam: Oh. Okay, so then what's satire?

16:48.167 --> 16:52.036
Archer: Nobody really knows!
Hang on! [tires squealing]

16:52.171 --> 16:56.040
And then back up a sec.
You're endangering your life for beauty?

16:56.175 --> 17:00.178
Pam: Yes, duh. Look, how hot am I now?
Let me answer that for you.

17:00.312 --> 17:03.247
As balls. That's why
everybody likes me now.

17:03.382 --> 17:06.250
Archer: Who, your trucker buddies?!
They only like you because

17:06.385 --> 17:09.287
- you have coke, Pam.
- Pam: Well, and the snowballs, but...

17:09.421 --> 17:12.957
Archer: And for what it's worth, we
all kind of liked you the way you were.

17:13.092 --> 17:16.027
- [gunshot] Pam: Really?
- Archer: Well, we hated you less.

17:16.161 --> 17:21.757
- You kind of turned into a ginormous asshole.
- Pam: Yeah, with ginormous big tittays.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.166
Archer: Oh, for... Pam, who cares?

17:23.301 --> 17:28.071
That's just subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Albeit a shitload of it.

17:28.207 --> 17:33.157
- But I can't bang you if you die from an overdose.
- Pam: Aw, you want to bang me?

17:33.192 --> 17:35.346
[gunshot]
Archer: Obviously! I mean look at those

17:35.481 --> 17:38.349
big bastards! Sucks we're
gonna go to prison, though.

17:38.484 --> 17:42.323
- Pam: Prison? But it's my first offense.
- Archer: Well, except for treason,

17:42.358 --> 17:46.438
<i>but explain all that to the
Brazos County judge, and maybe he'll...</i>

17:46.473 --> 17:49.127
Pam: Wait a minute, we're in
Travis county. Why does their car

17:49.261 --> 17:52.096
- say Brazos county?
- Archer: Give you three guesses!

17:52.231 --> 17:54.843
<i>- Pam: Crooked cops?
- Archer: Yes!</i>

17:54.873 --> 17:58.219
- Pam: Hang on, I still got two...
- Archer: Pam, get the coke!

17:58.217 --> 17:59.571
Pam: Yeah!
Holy coke snacks.

17:59.572 --> 18:02.039
- Enable the shit out of me!
- Archer: What?

18:02.174 --> 18:04.409
- Not to snort, you idiot!
- Pam: Well, I don't want to shoot it.

18:04.543 --> 18:08.525
- That seems like a pretty slippery slope!
- Archer: Pam, any cocaine is

18:08.560 --> 18:11.048
a slippery slope! It's the
world's most addictive drug.

18:11.183 --> 18:15.192
<i>- Pam: Hang on, I heard it was nicotine.
- Archer: It may very well be, Pam, </i>

18:15.227 --> 18:19.355
but in our current situation I would
argue that cocaine is more dangerous,

18:19.390 --> 18:23.094
because we're about to get
murdered for it! [gunshots]

18:23.228 --> 18:28.198
- [tires squealing] Pam: Yeah, but not overall...
- They don't want us,

18:28.233 --> 18:32.281
- they just want the coke, so throw it out!
- Pam: Of the car?

18:32.416 --> 18:36.119
- Archer: Pam!
- Pam: Jeez, okay! But you're gonna owe me!

18:36.253 --> 18:41.124
- Archer: What could I possibly owe you?!
- Pam: I believe there was some

18:41.258 --> 18:46.195
- mention of bone-throwing?
- Archer: Okay, yeah, that seems like a win-win.

18:46.330 --> 18:51.200
<i>Charlene: # I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run! # [screaming]</i>

18:51.335 --> 18:54.304

Woooooo!
[crowd booing]

19:03.138 --> 19:05.414
- Malory: Wait, what?
- Cherlene: Outlaw country!

19:05.549 --> 19:09.352
Malory: No, no, no, you don't walk off after
one song; you get back out there this instant.

19:09.486 --> 19:13.093
- What are you doing?
- Cherlene: Uh, it's called cultivating mystique?

19:13.128 --> 19:14.545
- Malory: But...
- Cherlene: It's also called

19:14.546 --> 19:17.182
sniffing a shit-ton of glue in
my tour bus hot tub

19:17.183 --> 19:20.296
- because I personify outlaw country?
- Malory: The...

19:20.430 --> 19:24.783
- Cherlene: Outlaw country! Woooooo!
- Tony: Howdy, Tony Foti, Stringer Records,

19:24.818 --> 19:28.171
and I want to make that little gal
famous. Are you her manager, Mrs...?

19:28.305 --> 19:31.946
- Malory: Oh, no, it's actually Ms....
- Lana: It's actually Mrs.

19:31.981 --> 19:35.165
- Malory: Will you put...
- Wait, genuinely doesn't matter. Give me a call

19:35.188 --> 19:39.211
when y'all are ready to make some
gold records. Yee-haw! [slaps]

19:39.346 --> 19:42.281
- Malory: Ooh! Well, that went better than expected.
- Lana: Yeah, maybe you can use

19:42.415 --> 19:45.184
the gold records to pay Archer and Pam's bail.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.419
- Cyril: I actually don't think you can.
- Archer: Plus there's no need.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.175
- Lana: Wait, what?
- Malory: Sterling!

19:49.176 --> 19:51.512
Archer: Yeah, no, everything
is, uh, totally fine now,

19:51.547 --> 19:53.259
and we totally got away.
So, all set.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.594
Malory: Yes, but how?
The police were right behind you.

19:55.729 --> 19:59.164
Archer: Which is right where I wanted
them, so I could go old school Bandit.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.334
- With an inverted triple Needham.
- Malory: Well, it was your own

20:02.469 --> 20:07.129
fault for bringing cocaine without asking,
but I suppose all's well that ends well.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.281
- Pam: Well, except for...
- Archer: Pam?

20:09.320 --> 20:12.636
- All's well that ends well?
- Pam: Oh, right.

20:13.696 --> 20:17.122
But what about the hundred pounds
of coke you dumped on the highway?

20:17.157 --> 20:19.516
