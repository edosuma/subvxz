WEBVTT

00:36.454 --> 00:42.960
SON OF THE WHITE MARE

00:47.631 --> 00:53.220
In memory of the Scythians, Huns,
Avars and other nomadic peoples.

04:38.404 --> 04:42.283
Once upon a time,

04:43.242 --> 04:46.537
in a land far,
far from here,

04:47.705 --> 04:51.083
almost at the gates of Hell,

04:52.084 --> 04:54.420
there stood a tall Turkey
oak tree.

04:55.629 --> 05:00.384
It had 77 roots and
77 branches.

05:00.926 --> 05:05.139
On the 77 roots stood
77 dragons.

05:05.472 --> 05:09.018
On the 77 branches sat
77 crows...

05:12.771 --> 05:17.526
If you don't listen to my story,
may 77 dragons steal your soul,

05:17.776 --> 05:21.238
and 77 crows peck out your eyes!

05:22.364 --> 05:26.744
Once upon a time,

05:27.786 --> 05:32.333
there was a King.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.171
And his Queen...

05:40.049 --> 05:41.133
and...

05:44.928 --> 05:47.973
they had three sons,
each of them tall and strong.

05:48.974 --> 05:55.481
Your Royal Highness, dear father...
We were thinking...

05:55.731 --> 05:57.274
Give us our fair share!

05:57.399 --> 06:00.277
Dear father and mother,
our King and Queen,

06:01.195 --> 06:03.238
we would like to get married.

06:19.922 --> 06:26.720
You may have your share of the kingdom.
My palaces are open to you.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.516
But do not enter those,

06:31.600 --> 06:36.146
which are closed and locked!

07:15.227 --> 07:20.899
<i>There was a grand wedding banquet,
behind the beyond.</i>

07:23.735 --> 07:28.240
<i>And they lived happily,
showered with love and peace...</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:36.582
<i>until death tore them apart.</i>

07:40.252 --> 07:45.048
<i>For the newly-wedded wives
were too nosy!</i>

07:59.313 --> 08:04.902
<i>They ignored the King's warning,
and broke the Dragon's chains.</i>

08:25.422 --> 08:28.217
<i>And hell was unleashed upon us...</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:56.902
<i>The white mare had given
birth twice,</i>

12:57.944 --> 13:00.864
<i>but nobody knew where her
sons had gone.</i>

13:02.699 --> 13:04.993
<i>And then the mare became
pregnant for a third time.</i>

13:08.789 --> 13:14.586
<i>You cannot provide milk for
a third son,</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.798
<i>and so,
your life ends here.</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:58.713
<i>The white mare ran into the deep
forest, and hid in a big hollow tree.</i>

13:59.798 --> 14:02.676
And that's where she gave birth.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.929
A boy was born.

14:07.931 --> 14:12.227
My dearest mother,
let me go!

14:12.310 --> 14:15.564
I'll settle those dragons
once and for all!

14:19.401 --> 14:20.735
All right.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.869
Can you see that big tree,
my son?

14:30.871 --> 14:34.624
Let me see how strong you are!

14:35.458 --> 14:37.919
Can you pull it up by the roots?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.548
God bless you,
Grandfather.

15:25.675 --> 15:30.347
It's fortunate you're able to
call me "Grandfather."

15:33.516 --> 15:34.976
My son...

15:40.231 --> 15:43.068
Why are you crying?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.740
What's wrong?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.035
My dear Grandfather,
I wish I was strong enough

15:52.202 --> 15:55.330
to pull out the biggest tree
by its roots

15:55.497 --> 15:57.832
and play with it like a stick.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.461
Don't cry, my son.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.589
You are very young.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.887
Just go home.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.643
And tell your mother

16:17.519 --> 16:21.064
to nurse you...

16:24.651 --> 16:27.195
for seven more years.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.033
Then you will become much stronger.

16:33.785 --> 16:42.877
Try to shake that tree once
every single year.

16:46.256 --> 16:50.135
And you will see that
as the years go by,

16:50.218 --> 16:53.096
and the stronger you become,
the more it will move.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.438
Mom!

17:02.689 --> 17:04.941
Mom!

17:06.276 --> 17:08.028
Mom!

17:09.320 --> 17:10.321
Mom...

17:12.365 --> 17:19.581
Mom, an old man told me to ask you
to nurse me for... seven more years.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.209
All right, my dear,
go ahead.

17:24.127 --> 17:28.965
I hope there will be
enough milk for you.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.730
Grandfather!

18:26.689 --> 18:29.442
Grandfather!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.696
My dear son.

18:35.115 --> 18:39.452
I can see that you are
trying hard.

18:44.916 --> 18:51.631
Tell your mother to nurse you
for seven more years.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.554
Then you will be able to shake
the tree one-handed.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.313
You are a big boy,
my son.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.025
And my back hurts so much.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.281
But I'm going to nurse you,
whatever it takes.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.443
Mom!
Look, Mom!

19:54.027 --> 19:57.780
Dear son, I'm dying!

19:58.281 --> 20:03.661
Put it down!
Heaven will fall upon us!

20:13.004 --> 20:14.214
Mother!

20:19.636 --> 20:23.181
You, Treeshaker...

20:25.850 --> 20:28.394
Now you are strong enough.

20:29.354 --> 20:34.234
Go to the Underworld.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.446
I...

20:39.989 --> 20:41.741
I'm going to die.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.079
Mother.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.874
Dear mother...

20:52.335 --> 20:53.878
Mother!

22:41.903 --> 22:44.906
Hey you!
What are you doing?

22:45.323 --> 22:47.450
Leave those mountains alone!

22:54.374 --> 22:57.794
Watch out or you'll be the one
rolling around!

23:00.004 --> 23:01.714
Alright,
I'm ready for you.

23:07.929 --> 23:12.600
- Let's see who's stronger.
- All right.

23:44.173 --> 23:49.804
I'm a strong man,
but you're even stronger.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.598
Don't hit me,
Treeshaker!

23:53.057 --> 23:54.725
I'll be your loyal companion.

23:54.934 --> 23:59.939
- "Treeshaker?" How do you know me?
- I've heard about you.

24:00.481 --> 24:04.193
You pull up trees, as easily as women
pull up hemp in the summer.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.446
Oh, and also we're brothers.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.531
How is that?

24:10.241 --> 24:14.120
From both sides.
From our mother's and father's side.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.289
From the white mare's lap.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.333
Put it here, brother!

24:21.461 --> 24:24.297
What's brought you here,
ummm...?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.763
My name is Stonecrumbler.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.099
Well Stonecrumbler,
what brought you here?

24:35.266 --> 24:39.687
The same thing that brought
you here, Treeshaker.

24:44.859 --> 24:47.904
All right, my friend.
Let's go together.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.781
But two of us will not be enough.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.910
- We must find a third companion.
- I have a good brother.

24:54.619 --> 24:59.749
Not far from here. He's at the foot
of the Iron Mountains.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.792
He tempers iron in a forge.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.794
All right,
let's have a drink to celebrate.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.660
You've had enough for today,
my friend.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.041
Gah!
That's hot!

25:43.751 --> 25:47.463
My brother must be tempering
the iron. Look, there he is!

26:52.445 --> 26:53.446
God bless you!

26:59.535 --> 27:02.038
God bless you,
Irontemperer!

27:04.540 --> 27:07.251
God bless you too,
Treeshaker!

27:13.674 --> 27:17.053
What brings you here?

27:17.595 --> 27:18.429
I... um...

27:18.596 --> 27:23.059
We are going to try our luck
in the Underworld.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.602
Do you want to come with us?

27:25.436 --> 27:27.647
I will go with you,
my friend.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.279
But first I want to know who is
the strongest among us.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.073
Who is going to lead us?

27:38.282 --> 27:39.283
Let's wrestle!

28:31.585 --> 28:34.588
You see? I could've killed you
if I wanted to.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.924
Come and join us.

28:42.012 --> 28:42.930
Give me your hand.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.734
Yes, my friend, you are indeed
the strongest among us.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.153
Stonecrumbler and I
will follow you.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.534
Let's swear brotherhood.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.247
We will vow to stay together
at all costs.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.553
My dear brothers, my
mother told me

30:04.678 --> 30:09.934
that the fairy princesses have been
kidnapped by dragons.

30:10.184 --> 30:13.771
We must find the hole the dragons
used to enter the Underworld.

30:14.522 --> 30:15.981
I would say...

30:17.191 --> 30:18.859
Let's go that way.

30:24.782 --> 30:26.492
Wait for me!

30:27.034 --> 30:28.536
Wait for me!

30:28.619 --> 30:31.914
Just... wait for me!

32:04.089 --> 32:06.759
We'll set up camp here.

32:07.259 --> 32:11.597
And we can start looking for the
dragon's trail.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.000
My friend,
Stonecrumbler,

32:40.084 --> 32:42.753
you were the first one
I asked to join me.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.631
So I ask you first to stay home,
cook lunch and make a rope.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.978
Hello,
Stonecrumbler.

34:23.687 --> 34:29.860
I am the seven-colored Gnome,
my beard is as long as a hoe!

34:30.444 --> 34:32.988
- What are you cooking?
- Porridge.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.826
- Can I have some?
- No, you can't.

34:39.078 --> 34:42.706
Then I will eat it off your belly!

34:51.131 --> 34:56.053
H-h-have as much as you want!

34:59.932 --> 35:02.601
Yummy, yummy!

35:03.685 --> 35:04.520
Yummy.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.592
Have you found anything,
Irontemperer?

35:36.510 --> 35:40.556
Not even a tiny mousehole.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.398
What happened to you,
Stonecrumbler?

35:58.198 --> 36:00.325
You didn't make a rope,
or cook the food!

36:02.369 --> 36:07.291
So your belly hurts.
Have you eaten our lunch?

36:36.445 --> 36:40.365
My brother, Irontemperer, you were
the second I asked to join me.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.619
This time you will stay home to
cook lunch and make a rope.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.360
- Hello, Irontemperer.
- Hello.

37:16.443 --> 37:20.864
I am the seven-colored Gnome,
my beard is as long as a hoe!

37:23.367 --> 37:26.870
- What are you working on?
- I'm making a rope.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.331
I can see that!
But what are you cooking?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.793
Porridge.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.506
- Can I have some?
- No way, Gnome!

37:38.382 --> 37:41.843
Then I will eat it off your belly!

37:54.523 --> 37:56.358
No use crying,
it's too late now.

37:57.401 --> 38:00.612
I'm already eating!
You can have some after me.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.978
Are you sitting in our food?

38:34.646 --> 38:37.774
I am sick,
I've fallen ill.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.737
I finished the rope!
Don't you dare!

38:54.124 --> 38:56.376
All right, friends, today I am
going to stay home.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.045
And you're going to look
for that hole.

39:15.729 --> 39:21.943
Good day to you,
Treeshaker.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.905
Good day to you,
my friend.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.824
I am the...

39:28.867 --> 39:30.869
...Gnome...

39:34.664 --> 39:37.376
Where was I...? Oh, yes,
what are you cooking?

39:37.459 --> 39:39.419
- Porridge.
- Can I have some?

39:42.923 --> 39:48.637
I'm going to have an even better
lunch than the past two days.

39:49.179 --> 39:53.225
I don't think so.
I need it for my friends and I.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.560
Then I'll eat it off your belly!

39:57.896 --> 40:02.609
No way!
You've had a feast for two days.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.987
You've had the porridge
off my friend's bellies.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.616
You're not gonna have it off mine.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.828
Hey!
What are you doing to me?

40:14.121 --> 40:17.707
Let me go! It's not nice to
treat an old man like this!

40:35.767 --> 40:36.935
You asked for it,
buddy.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.238
Hurry up!
I've been waiting for you guys.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.493
- You're not feeling ill?
- No.

42:16.618 --> 42:19.788
- Have you finished cooking the porridge?
- Yes!

42:22.165 --> 42:24.584
All right,
let's eat!

42:53.113 --> 42:56.575
My friends, I have found the
entrance to the Underworld.

42:59.452 --> 43:02.455
He was the one that
showed me the way!

43:05.292 --> 43:07.043
Have you got a knife,
Irontemperer?

43:17.804 --> 43:21.474
Oh, no,
let me keep my power!

43:23.518 --> 43:25.687
I'm begging you!
No!

43:25.854 --> 43:29.107
Nooo!

43:45.081 --> 43:47.584
Irontemperer,
you have strong arms.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.461
Make me a strong sword!

44:46.559 --> 44:49.229
Irontemperer,
it's no good.

44:49.396 --> 44:52.357
Make me a stronger one!
A sword that won't break.

45:35.066 --> 45:38.737
Irontemperer,
you're a terrible blacksmith.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.449
This sword...

45:43.366 --> 45:44.451
...will not...

45:45.368 --> 45:46.494
...break...

45:47.328 --> 45:48.496
...in two...

45:49.414 --> 45:50.749
...ever...

45:51.082 --> 45:52.167
...again!

45:55.211 --> 45:59.340
All right, my brothers, that won't
be coming back anytime soon.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.915
Hit it and chop it,
my little sword!

46:36.920 --> 46:38.630
Back to the sheath,
my little sword.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.635
Now it's strong enough,
my friend!

46:44.219 --> 46:46.429
Come on friends,
let's go down one by one.

46:56.898 --> 47:00.026
One of us will go down first
to look around.

47:01.653 --> 47:02.821
Who will it be?

47:09.869 --> 47:11.996
Is this rope strong enough?

47:12.539 --> 47:14.499
Don't worry, I weaved it,
not you!

47:32.809 --> 47:36.563
Pull me up!

47:44.153 --> 47:46.114
Pull me up!

47:54.205 --> 47:57.876
There are so many nasty
creatures down there,

47:57.959 --> 48:00.545
they almost pecked out my eyes.

48:00.962 --> 48:04.007
It was so dark,
I couldn't see my own hands.

48:04.591 --> 48:07.510
"I couldn't see my own hands."
You coward!

48:09.262 --> 48:10.305
Send me down.

48:10.889 --> 48:12.891
A thousand devils wouldn't
frighten me.

48:36.581 --> 48:37.582
Hey!

48:37.999 --> 48:39.667
Hey, come on!

48:56.392 --> 48:58.561
All right,
I'll try my luck.

49:00.730 --> 49:03.942
Pull me up if I shake the rope
three times.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.403
Hello, Gnome!

49:49.779 --> 49:52.657
- Behave yourself!
- Give me back my beard, please.

49:53.408 --> 49:55.743
I can hardly walk.

49:56.703 --> 49:59.789
My beard held what
little strength I had.

49:59.998 --> 50:03.459
You don't need it, my friend.
And it will grow back, won't it?

50:03.543 --> 50:08.548
I'll give you whatever you want,
just let me have my beard back.

50:09.841 --> 50:11.009
I'll give it back.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.219
I'll give it back if you show me

50:13.302 --> 50:14.887
the palace where the eldest
princess lives.

50:15.054 --> 50:17.223
I'll show it to you!
Look to the right!

50:17.849 --> 50:21.936
There is a revolving copper castle
on the top of that mountain.

50:22.395 --> 50:24.022
You can see it shining from here.

50:24.480 --> 50:27.233
The eldest princess lives there.

50:28.443 --> 50:31.154
But it's useless for you
to go there.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.655
Get off me, Gnome!

50:32.864 --> 50:36.200
It's pointless, I tell you!
You won't be able to enter...

50:36.284 --> 50:39.871
It keeps spinning,
and there's no way to stop it!

50:39.996 --> 50:43.082
And a three-headed dragon
guards the castle!

51:08.608 --> 51:12.278
Castle, stop spinning!
Or else, I'll destroy you!

51:29.921 --> 51:31.964
Good day and God bless you!

51:59.700 --> 52:01.327
What brought you here?

52:02.453 --> 52:07.917
No soul ever comes here.

52:08.084 --> 52:09.961
I am here...

52:11.963 --> 52:13.422
I've come for you.

52:13.589 --> 52:17.510
Oh just get lost,
before my husband comes home.

52:18.094 --> 52:21.139
My husband is the
three-headed dragon.

52:21.806 --> 52:24.225
And when he gets home,
he'll kill you.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.894
I don't care how many
heads he has!

52:27.562 --> 52:29.730
And how do you even know
he's on his way home?

53:37.256 --> 53:38.549
Woman!

53:39.842 --> 53:42.637
I smell a stranger here.

53:43.012 --> 53:46.807
Come on,
you can't smell anything.

53:47.475 --> 53:54.148
Whenever you get home,
you always smell strangers.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.904
Oh...

54:00.071 --> 54:02.657
...my brother has come to visit us.

54:27.890 --> 54:33.813
Well then,
let's fight on the copper field!

54:33.896 --> 54:35.690
By sword or by hand?

54:35.773 --> 54:37.566
Let's wrestle.

54:38.734 --> 54:43.823
That seems like a better idea.

54:44.407 --> 54:46.575
Then come on,
brother-in-law!

56:14.080 --> 56:16.165
Oh, my sweet savior.

56:16.457 --> 56:19.210
My father will grant you my
hand in marriage

56:19.293 --> 56:21.379
and you'll get half
of his kingdom.

56:21.754 --> 56:24.465
Get your stuff and let's go.

56:25.674 --> 56:29.470
Where shall we go,
my sweet savior?

56:29.678 --> 56:33.641
You have two sisters down here who
were also kidnapped by dragons!

56:33.724 --> 56:35.226
Fine,
let's go and save them.

57:27.278 --> 57:29.155
Go and hide in the forest.

57:37.204 --> 57:40.499
Castle, stop spinning!

57:41.375 --> 57:45.004
Or else,
I'll destroy you!

57:45.588 --> 57:48.591
You are not my master,
you cannot give me orders.

57:49.425 --> 57:53.762
If I weren't your master,
I wouldn't give you orders!

57:58.017 --> 57:59.393
Greetings!

57:59.560 --> 58:02.354
What brought you here?
No soul ever comes here.

58:02.521 --> 58:03.981
I've come for you.

58:04.148 --> 58:06.775
Oh just get lost,
before my husband comes home.

58:06.859 --> 58:08.903
My husband is the
seven-headed dragon.

58:08.986 --> 58:12.072
He can throw his club from seven
miles. When he gets home...

58:12.239 --> 58:13.491
...he'll kill me, I know.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.827
Yes, he'll kill you,
right away.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.455
My dear, I don't care how
many heads he has.

58:19.622 --> 58:21.540
Just give me something to eat.

58:21.707 --> 58:22.917
I'm starving.

59:28.148 --> 59:34.530
Who's here?
I'll tear him apart!

59:34.613 --> 59:36.865
There's nobody here.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.582
Nobody?

59:47.626 --> 59:52.464
My dear husband, don't hurt him!
That's my brother, he came for a visit!

59:54.300 --> 01:00:00.055
Oh, all right then!
Nice to see you, brother-in-law.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:16.280
Hey brother,
that's a strong grip you have!

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:25.956
All right,
let's have something to eat...

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.792
Shall we?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:29.918
Go ahead.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:51.231
Well then, brother,
let's wrestle!

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:02.034
You dog!
You must die!

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.663
My silver field is waiting for you.

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:26.517
Are you running away?

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:14.333
Ouch! Where are you going,
my sweet savior?

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.043
On to your other sister.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.961
Don't even think about it!

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.922
Her husband is the
twelve-headed dragon!

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:22.591
He can throw his club from
twelve miles away.

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:23.634
When he gets home...

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.812
Just show me the way
to the third castle.

01:03:54.915 --> 01:04:01.171
Castle, stop spinning!
Or else, I'll destroy you!

01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.509
I'm getting tired of this...

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:26.071
Good day and God bless you.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:39.459
What brought you here?
No soul ever comes here.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.295
I've come for you.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.423
Oh, my sweet savior.

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:45.233
Drink this potion,
my love.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.653
My husband's strength
comes from it.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.948
Drink up,
every last drop.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.349
My dear husband,
do not be mad at him.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:21.770
He has thrown your club so that you
would know you have a guest.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:26.358
I'm not mad,
I have many more.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:34.032
I know you, Treeshaker,
Son of the White Mare.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:40.831
I've known ever since you were
just a tiny fetus

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:48.380
in your mother's womb, that someday
we would do battle.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.182
You have killed two of my brothers.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:06.189
Even if you have a thousand lives,
you'll die for this.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:13.113
But first, let's have something
to eat. Then we'll fight.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:20.120
I see, you already ate my food
and drank my wine.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:28.003
Let's see, then, how strong you are.
Join me on the golden field.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:43.615
I can't go with you.

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:46.868
The rope might break,
or my brothers won't be strong enough.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:48.995
I'll go after you.

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:33.141
Dear God! How am I going to get
up out of here?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.352
<i>The same way that you came down.</i>

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.939
I won't!

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.070
My brothers threw me back
down here to die.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.782
They don't want me to get out of here,
but I'm smarter!

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.451
I've tried my luck,
and it's been

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.119
exactly as I expected!

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:57.957
If you give my beard back to me...
as you promised.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.961
I'll give it back to you as
I no longer need it.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:06.800
There is a high mountain nearby.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:10.095
A huge griffin lives on top.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:16.726
If you ask that old griffin,
she will take you back up.

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:19.813
Thank you.
Thank you, Gnome.

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:45.190
Please, tell me...

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:49.652
how can I repay you...

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:55.450
for saving...

01:14:55.533 --> 01:15:00.538
my nestlings?

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.753
I just want you to take me
up to the other world!

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:10.256
I would take you,

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:16.262
but I'm afraid I don't have the
strength to make it that far.

01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:27.023
But if you get me twelve oxen

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.945
and twelve barrels of wine,

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:36.449
then I'll be able to make it.

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:51.631
Thank you, Treeshaker,
Son of the White Mare.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:58.972
You've killed the three dragons
and the snake.

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:04.018
I used to be the king of this world.

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.982
And now I have my power back.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:29.961
I can see you brought everything
I asked for.

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:37.844
Put them up on my back and
we can leave right away.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.433
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready!

01:17:56.464 --> 01:18:02.011
What was the last thing
you fed me?

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:11.062
If I'd only known your flesh would
give me such strength...

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:20.488
But you have been so generous
in saving my life,

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:27.328
that in return I'll give back
your leg!

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.991
Don't hurt them!
They're innocent.

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:12.623
- Please, Treeshaker! Forgive us!
- No! Wait! Don't hurt us!

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:17.378
We didn't let you down!
It was too heavy!

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:40.234
Forgive me,
my friends.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.620
I beg you to forgive me.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:10.968
Son of the White Mare,
known as Treeshaker,

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:15.139
and his brothers got into an
eggshell and rolled

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:18.351
to their home on the
diamond fields,

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.228
where they loved in perfect bliss
and harmony,

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:26.692
and lived happily ever after.
