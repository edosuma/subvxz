[***]

01:18.812 --> 01:21.115
Sara, you won't believe it!

01:21.149 --> 01:23.284
I just saw a Deinosuchus
under the water!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.853
Its name means
"terrible crocodile"

01:25.886 --> 01:28.422
because it looked like
a huge crocodile.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.359
It's going now.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.860
But maybe it'll be back.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.663
Sara?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.865
Sara, are you okay?

01:37.898 --> 01:39.467

01:39.500 --> 01:42.736
Yes...
I'm fine.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.139

Are you gonna jump?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.107
Uh huh...

01:49.577 --> 01:51.179
[Dana]
When?

01:54.515 --> 01:57.351
Great cannonball, Dana.
I liked your form.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.753
Head down, legs in,
maximum splash.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.923
Sara!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.892
You're holding up the line.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.334

02:18.906 --> 02:21.642
You're gonna have to let go
of that railing sometime.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.613
You can do it, Sara!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.681
[whispered]
She's probably not gonna do it.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.417
She's scared of heights.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.287
Hey, Sara, I used to be
scared of heights,

02:33.321 --> 02:36.290
but then I read a quote
from a great philosopher

02:36.324 --> 02:37.825
that changed my life.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.927
He said,
"Just don't look down."

02:39.960 --> 02:41.595
[Sara gasps]

02:42.830 --> 02:44.265
Huh.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.866
I've never seen anyone
belly flop

02:45.899 --> 02:47.668
without actually
hitting the water.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.737
Do I have to jump?

Oh, only if you wanna
pass this swim class.

You okay?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.260
Uh, yeah.
I'm great.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.662
I have an idea how
to get you down,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.897
but I need you
to act like a...

03:16.930 --> 03:18.899
- Dinosaur?
- ...dinosaur.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.902
Remember how I told you I saw
the Deinosuchus under water?

03:21.935 --> 03:22.936
Yeah.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.438
Just like crocodiles today,

03:24.472 --> 03:26.807
it spends some of its time
in the water

03:26.840 --> 03:28.576
and some of it on the ground.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.511
And guess how it moved
on the ground.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.746
- Like a crocodile?
- Exactly.

03:32.780 --> 03:36.350
So why don't you turn around
and crocodile-walk back to me?

03:36.384 --> 03:40.754
Or I could just live up here...
[gasp] ...forever.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.324
Seeeeester...

03:46.660 --> 03:47.795
Great!

03:47.828 --> 03:49.763
Now crocodile-walk.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.404
Would it help if I made
crocodile noise...

03:56.437 --> 03:57.438
No.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.439
Thank you.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.740

03:59.773 --> 04:01.909

[***]

04:09.983 --> 04:11.552
You did it!

04:11.585 --> 04:13.921
Not really.
I didn't jump.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.658
You coming?

04:17.691 --> 04:20.027
I'll meet you
down at the bottom.

There's a Spinosaurus?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.654
Is that your mom down there?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.456
I think she's looking for you.

04:48.489 --> 04:53.327

04:53.361 --> 04:54.995
Are you afraid of the water?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.764
It's okay.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.732
Paleontologists think that,
just like the Deinosuchus,

04:58.766 --> 05:01.769
you spent a lot of your life
in the water, too.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.971
Maybe that's why your
snouts look the same.

Sorry, couldn't help myself.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.889
- I'm never gonna pass.
- That's not true.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.659
You just have to get over
your fear of heights.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.561
Easy for you to say.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.129
You're not afraid of anything.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.564
That's not true.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.499
I used to be afraid
of dinosaurs.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.768
What?
I didn't know that.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.003
Yeah, when I first
heard about them,

06:10.037 --> 06:12.973
I thought they were big,
and scary, and mean looking,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.875
especially the T-Rex.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.445
[roar]

06:20.981 --> 06:23.016
But when I started
learning about them,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.918
I realized they were
super-interesting,

06:24.952 --> 06:26.654
mostly because they
survived on being

06:26.687 --> 06:28.188
big, and mean,
and scary looking.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.558
Well, I don't think
learning about heights

06:30.591 --> 06:32.993
is going to help me
get over my fear.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.864
No, but when I get scared now,
I pretend I'm a dinosaur.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.466
It works every time.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.701
Is that why you roar
sometimes at night?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.970
I'm a little bit
scared of the dark.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.038
C'mon.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.675

Lesson number one--
the Deinosuchus.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.597
The Deinosuchus
got into the water

07:09.630 --> 07:11.031
just like crocodiles today--

07:11.064 --> 07:13.634
by crawling in.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.903
It helps if you
make their noises.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.873

07:21.074 --> 07:24.678
- Croc!

Now go!

And it was only kind of scary.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.739
- Good job.
- What's our next lesson?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.743
[***]

07:59.547 --> 08:02.683
Lesson number two--
the Spinosaurus.

[hissing and growling]

08:05.886 --> 08:08.922
[hissing and growling]

08:08.956 --> 08:13.527
Spinosaurus got into the water
by walking on its massive legs.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.196
I... didn't know that.
Tell me more.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.865
Quit stalling.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.066
It's Spinosaurus time.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.003
Now walk into that water,
Spinosaurus,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.573
and remember to roar!

08:25.606 --> 08:29.843
[***]

08:29.877 --> 08:31.211
Roar!

08:33.947 --> 08:35.583
I did it!

08:35.616 --> 08:37.985
- That was great.
- What's the next lesson?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.055
Uh oh.

08:43.123 --> 08:47.227
[***]

08:47.260 --> 08:49.830
Unfortunately, there's no
dinosaur that would've

08:49.863 --> 08:52.065
dived into the water
this high up...

08:52.099 --> 08:53.801
Uh, that's okay, Dana.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.603
Let's go back.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.606
BUT there were pre-historic
winged reptiles that would.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.715

09:07.748 --> 09:10.117
The Pterodactylus
would dive into the water

09:10.150 --> 09:12.085
looking for yummy fish to eat.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.124
I can't do this.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.728
You can't...
but Pterodactylus can.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.863
Happy fish hunting!

09:23.931 --> 09:27.868

09:28.936 --> 09:30.003

You did it!

09:56.296 --> 09:57.731
WE did it.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.999
Squawk!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.902
Nice jump, Sara.

10:01.935 --> 10:06.173
The squawk was a bit weird,
but other than that, great job.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.775
You passed your level one.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.176

Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!

11:23.884 --> 11:26.053
The microraptor sees the bait.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.889
The microraptor is a really
fascinating dinosaur,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.725
mostly because it's the first
dinosaur ever discovered

11:31.759 --> 11:33.193
to have four wings.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.796
Two on its arms
and two on its legs.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.397
They called it
microraptor

11:37.430 --> 11:39.199
because it's tiny

11:39.232 --> 11:41.234
but it's also
a super skilled predator.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.271
Hopefully it will use
one of those skills on my bait.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.909
[chirping]

11:48.942 --> 11:51.779
Come and get it,
Microraptor.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.513
I'm so tasty.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.849
Come and eat me.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.152
He spreaded his wings.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.955
Looks like
he's about to take off!

12:01.989 --> 12:03.991
Come and get it,
Microraptor.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.266
He's gliding!

Squeak, squeak.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.173
Dana,
it's freezing in here.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.013
Sorry, microraptor.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.514
What was that?

12:27.547 --> 12:30.350
Sar, the microraptor
was just about to get in here

12:30.383 --> 12:32.886
and help me solve
dino experiment 504,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.789
how did the microraptor
hunt its food.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.358
Oh, that explains
where my sock went.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.327
Yes...

12:40.360 --> 12:42.295
The microraptor was one
of the smallest dinosaurs

12:42.329 --> 12:43.563
ever found.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.933
It only weighed
as much as a pigeon.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.301
What does that
have to do with my sock?

12:48.335 --> 12:51.538
I'm trying to see how it hunted
so I made an Eomaia.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.374
Plus, it already
had a hole in it

12:54.407 --> 12:57.010
and it smells really bad.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.912
No, it does not.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.347
Oh...

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
okay, you can keep it.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.118
So, about this Eo...

13:05.152 --> 13:06.386
Maia.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.056
It's smaller
than a pigeon,

13:09.089 --> 13:11.391
which would make it
the smallest dinosaur.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.160
Ha!
It's not a dinosaur.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.995
It's a prehistoric mammal.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.897
Mammals lived
with dinosaurs?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.398
Oh yeah.
Lots of them.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.201
You can tell it's
a mammal because it has fur

13:21.234 --> 13:23.503
and it didn't
lay eggs like dinos.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.438
Instead, it gave birth
to live babies.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.207

Gross.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.318
A lot?

13:38.351 --> 13:40.587
These two are my
favorite ones.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.555
Oh, kind of looks
like a mouse.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.158
[Dana] You know what else
looks like a mouse?

13:45.192 --> 13:46.226
A mouse!

13:46.259 --> 13:47.294
What?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.498
Ooh, she's getting
closer to you.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.867
- What?
- I think she likes you.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.236
- Ew, ew, ew.
- Who are you texting?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.637
Mom will be home soon,

13:57.670 --> 14:00.240
so I'm asking her
to buy a mouse trap.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.342
A mouse trap? No!
Run, mouse, run!

14:02.375 --> 14:05.578
Sara, we can't use a mouse trap
on that poor, little mammal.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.547
She could be
the great, great, great,

14:07.580 --> 14:09.382
great, great, great,
great, great, great,

14:09.416 --> 14:12.986
great, times a million
granddaughter of the Eomaia.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.587
I don't care-a!

14:14.621 --> 14:17.457
Dana, we can't have a mouse
living in the apartment.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.227
It's gross, and it'll leave
droppings everywhere.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.130
And mom thinks I'm right.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.665
What if I get her outside?

14:25.698 --> 14:29.136
Please, seester,
just give me a chance?

14:32.605 --> 14:36.409
[sigh] Fine, you have until Mom
gets home with the mouse trap.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.945
Deal!

14:43.083 --> 14:45.885
Think, Dana, think.
How do you catch a mouse?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.933
How is that trap
going to work.

14:59.967 --> 15:03.136
Mice are omnivores which means
they eat pretty much anything,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.538
so I used cheese, veggies,
and meat for bait.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.009
Once the mouse takes the bait,
the bucket will fall down,

15:09.042 --> 15:10.944
trap her,
and I'll take her outside.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.181
Better hurry up.
Mom will be home soon.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.482
There's the mouse!

15:15.515 --> 15:16.583
Whoa, where?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.051
[giggles]
Kidding.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.020
But you should have
seen your face.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.454
Very funny, Dana.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.624
Hmm...

15:24.657 --> 15:27.995
Looking at all this bait
is making me kind of hungry.

15:28.028 --> 15:32.966
[***]

15:35.735 --> 15:37.237
Mouse!

15:39.572 --> 15:42.009
Okay, mouse.
Calm down.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.411
I'm going to get you outside
where you belong.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.349
Mouse?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.684
But if you're
over there...

15:51.718 --> 15:53.420
who's in here?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.758
[squawks]

15:58.791 --> 16:00.260
Microraptor?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.764
Oh no.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.267
[chirps]

16:07.300 --> 16:10.003
The microraptor thinks the mouse
is a prehistoric mammal.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.172
Run, mouse!

16:14.574 --> 16:17.177
[chirps]

16:17.210 --> 16:21.414
[squawking]

16:23.583 --> 16:25.118
How'd he get in here?

16:25.152 --> 16:29.256
[chirping]

16:29.289 --> 16:32.725
[squawking]

16:36.563 --> 16:38.698
[distant squawking
and crashing]

16:43.436 --> 16:45.205
[sighs]

16:46.839 --> 16:48.608
[squawking]

16:50.110 --> 16:52.179
[distant crashes]

16:52.212 --> 16:54.047
Where'd they go?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.618
- Dana, what did you do?
- It wasn't me.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.288
The microraptor got in
through an open window.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.123
It's after the mouse.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.557
[Mom]
Girls, I'm home!

17:07.360 --> 17:09.662
Oh, guys,
what happened here?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.398
You should see the kitchen.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.700
Sar!
Saving lives is messy.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.269
Mom, I've been trying
to get the mouse outside

17:16.303 --> 17:17.570
and back to its family.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.572
Oh, that's sweet, nugget.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.674
Now, let mom
take care of it.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.243
But mom!

17:23.276 --> 17:25.178
We can't have mice
in the apartment,

17:25.212 --> 17:27.114
and clean up this
mess, please.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.582
Poor mouse.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.584
I'll help you
tidy up, Dana.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.689
You know, it probably
has a nice seeester mouse

17:36.723 --> 17:40.227
who loves it a lot
and is out there looking for it.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.195
I have an idea.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.198
Once mom's out of the kitchen,
I'll stay here cleaning up

17:45.232 --> 17:47.400
while you keep trying
to save the mouse.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.302
- Really?
- Traps out.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.539
I'll go get changed
and then I'll make dinner.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.307
Go, now's your chance.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.210
- Thanks, seester.
- You're welcome, seester.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.879
Oh, mice are still
so gross.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.250
Where are you?
Where are you?

18:03.283 --> 18:05.218
[squawks]

18:05.252 --> 18:06.819
There you are,
microraptor.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.889
[chirps]

18:09.922 --> 18:11.558
[squawks]

18:11.591 --> 18:14.694
No, no, no.
You don't want that.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.863
It's a trap.
You'll get hurt.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.531
Um...

18:21.334 --> 18:23.270
[chirping]

18:24.337 --> 18:28.275
[***]

18:29.342 --> 18:30.677
[squawk]

18:32.645 --> 18:34.581
[squawk]

18:35.648 --> 18:38.585
[***]

18:39.652 --> 18:42.422
[squawking]

18:42.455 --> 18:43.423
That was close.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.824
Still no mouse,

18:44.857 --> 18:47.527
but I think I just solved
my dino experiment

18:47.560 --> 18:49.262
on how you catch your food.

18:49.296 --> 18:53.366
Maybe I can use that
to catch the mouse.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.602
Do you want some
beef jerky for helping?

18:55.635 --> 18:58.338
[chirping]

19:01.608 --> 19:02.842
Then go get it!

19:05.645 --> 19:07.447
[chirps]

19:10.383 --> 19:12.252
[chirping]

19:12.285 --> 19:13.953
[crunching]

19:13.986 --> 19:15.555
[chirping]

19:15.588 --> 19:17.557
Chirp! Bye!

19:21.361 --> 19:23.830
Now I get to be
the microraptor.

19:23.863 --> 19:28.735
[***]

19:41.248 --> 19:43.683
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.788
Dana, what are you doing?

19:48.821 --> 19:51.224
I solved
dino experiment 504,

19:51.258 --> 19:53.660
how did the microraptor
hunt its food,

19:53.693 --> 19:56.863
so now I'm hunting the mouse
just like the microraptor would.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.599
So, uh, why are you
up on the chair?

19:59.632 --> 20:01.468
The microraptor
would hide up high

20:01.501 --> 20:03.270
so it's food
wouldn't see it.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.706
Then it would use its wings,
glide down and catch it.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.741
Just...

20:08.775 --> 20:11.844
like...

20:11.878 --> 20:12.812
this.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.549
Ew...

20:16.583 --> 20:17.917
[yells]

20:17.950 --> 20:20.987
You got it.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.356
- Nice work, microraptor.
- Thanks.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.991
Let's get this mouse
back outside.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.993
Uh, Sar,
do you wanna help?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.762
- Uh, yeah, no.
- Okay then.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.500
So, first thing we got to do
is slide that over.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.536
Okay, and now we got to
get a piece of paper

20:36.569 --> 20:37.837
and put it underneath, okay?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.806
Nope, nope...

20:41.040 --> 20:44.677
[***]
