WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.173
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:08.241 --> 00:10.543
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.078
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.749
We gonna mission
around all the party islands.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.352
(screaming)

00:21.187 --> 00:23.490
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.961
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.162
Boat parties.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.131
Paint parties.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.567
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.970
More necking on.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.372
Oh, shit.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.476
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.080
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:48.615 --> 00:50.183
Let's fucking do this.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.721
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking slag!

00:58.758 --> 01:00.126
Kick-offs.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.529
Marnie, Marnie!

01:04.563 --> 01:06.366
Drama.
Fuck off!

01:08.935 --> 01:10.603
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:10.670 --> 01:12.972
Let's get fucking mortal.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.310
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:19.279 --> 01:22.549
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:25.151 --> 01:27.487
We're in the club pulling birds.
I'm back.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.892
Have I had too many sangrias
or can I see Gaz kissing Chantelle?

01:32.959 --> 01:35.228
What the fuck?
Marty's pulled a girl.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.665
I am fucking done with her.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.533
We're not friends any more.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.002
I've done everything
to get his attention.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.572
I can think of one way
to get him to notice us.

01:48.708 --> 01:52.011
Marty keeps kissing Chloe
and thinking it's all right.

01:52.078 --> 01:53.713
That is basically cheating.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.485
I thought I could rely on him
to be there for us.

01:58.551 --> 02:01.421
He's completely walked out on us.
I can't believe it.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.857
There's no way
I can live with Marnie.

02:03.923 --> 02:05.625
I don't see us ever coming back.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.562
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.698
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.701
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.836
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.205
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.374
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.343
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.578
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.814
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.983
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.519
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:46.366 --> 02:48.801
Morning.
Morning.

02:48.868 --> 02:52.038
How are you feeling, Marnie?

02:53.873 --> 02:56.576
Last night,
Aaron's left us on bad terms.

02:56.643 --> 03:00.079
People laugh at me and Chloe
kissing. It's just a bit of banter.

03:00.146 --> 03:03.149
It doesn't mean anything.
Aaron said it was cheating.

03:03.216 --> 03:06.753
I'm sorry for telling on Marns
last night. I really am.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.824
In fact,
I blame everything on Aaron.

03:11.891 --> 03:14.160
This morning, I feel really bad.

03:14.227 --> 03:17.363
Last night, I tried to help things
between Aaron and Marnie

03:17.430 --> 03:19.666
by telling Aaron
that Marnie's bisexual

03:19.732 --> 03:21.301
and it fucked everything up.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.336
If I fell out with him before,

03:23.403 --> 03:25.972
by God I have fallen out
with him now.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.740
I'll never speak to him again.

03:27.807 --> 03:30.476
Me and Marnie are best friends
and we kiss.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.145
Big fucking deal!

03:32.211 --> 03:35.548
If that's how he's gonna act,
Marnie is better off without him.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.984
The amount of anger
I've got built up inside,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.986
I don't think it's fucking normal.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.521
(indistinct)

03:41.588 --> 03:45.892
No, I don't think it's normal
to have so much fucking anger.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.161
And I hate him so much
for doing that.

03:48.227 --> 03:51.998
I was like, you could've had the
decency to come over and tell us.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.801
He knows that I've been with girls.

03:54.867 --> 03:58.004
I've been in situations with Aaron,
but this is different.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.640
I never thought he would leave
and give up on us.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.080
(groans)

04:09.949 --> 04:11.784
Where the fuck is everyone?

04:11.851 --> 04:15.188
I've woke up
and there's just me and Marty.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.322
What the fuck is going on?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.826
Aaron, last night, went home.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.262
Ah. Sunshine.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.197
Fucking excellent.

04:26.265 --> 04:29.569
I was ill.
I was in a bad way last night.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.437
I had to stay here cos I felt ill,

04:31.504 --> 04:33.906
but I feel like I've missed out
on a lot.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.775
How was it though? Was it good?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.283
He fucking... "Ah, fuck this."

04:44.350 --> 04:47.053
And made a beeline
straight to the fucking door.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.187
Aaron's gone home.

04:48.254 --> 04:52.058
I don't know how anyone didn't know
that Marnie was bisexual.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.727
She's been shagging Chloe
every single night.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.364
He's now thinking, she's necking
with Chloe all the time.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.167
You're bisexual.
You're necking with girls.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.170
You're necking with Chloe
more than with me.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.605
We need to get packed.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.941
It's bad that Aaron's not here.
We need to sort ourselves out.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.877
Cos Anna's sending us to Kavos.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.946
Fucking hell.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.264
I've woke up this morning
and my hand is in bits.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.333
I don't know what I've done
or who I've been fingering,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.704
but it is fucked. I need to sort
this out when I get to Kavos.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.208
I was so excited
about going to Kavos,

05:42.275 --> 05:45.511
but now that Aaron's gone,
I'm just not that excited about it.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.251
Not gonna lie, Magaluf's had ups,
but a lot of downs.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.588
Fucking go.
Kavos can't be any worse. Woo!

05:55.655 --> 05:57.924
Let's just get the fuck out of here

05:57.990 --> 06:00.359
and hope Kavos is a lot better.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.800
Where is Kavos?
Greece.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.068
Cr... Er...
Crete?

06:09.135 --> 06:10.903
No, not Crete. Corfu.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.438
Corfu.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.877
I don't know
what Anna's got planned.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.613
It better be mint,
or she'll have me to deal with.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.885
Kavos! Kavos! Kavos!

06:27.520 --> 06:30.389
The Geordies are gonna
tear it clean up.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.962
We're here.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.665
We're going through
this radge lecky gate

06:39.732 --> 06:42.769
and all I can see is a wicked villa.
Well done, Anna.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.370
Yeah.

06:44.437 --> 06:48.808
(cheering)
Oh, my God. This is so cute.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.178
If one thing's gonna cheer us up,
it's this place.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.013
I've got a good feeling.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.820
Oh, my God! There's a Jacuzzi!

07:00.887 --> 07:04.290
We've come upstairs and it looks
like Fred Flintstone's house.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.958
Everything is made of stone.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.927
I'm buzzing to be here.

07:07.994 --> 07:10.930
This is way better.
We haven't even gone out yet.

07:10.997 --> 07:14.433
Yes! Kavos! Kavos! Kavos!
I wanna shag you!

07:20.606 --> 07:23.109
Me and the girls
have got the upstairs bedroom.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.012
Boys, yous are downstairs.
Bye, peasants.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.284
This is all right. This is me.
Oi! Oi!

07:31.350 --> 07:33.186
(indistinct)

07:33.252 --> 07:36.989
This villa looks wicked. I can see
some damage getting done in here.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.926
Got an idea, right?
Let's all get our tits out. Ready?

07:39.992 --> 07:42.261
This Kavos villa is actually amazing.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.864
The view is wicked
and everyone loves a view.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.834
Get our tits out. Two, three!
(all shout)

07:49.535 --> 07:51.604
(screams)

07:52.805 --> 07:55.441
Looks like Kavos is
gonna turn out all right.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.043
Everyone is getting on.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.278
It's a boat! It's a boat bed!

07:59.345 --> 08:01.214
Is this the shag pad?

08:01.280 --> 08:04.784
If the boat's rocking,
don't come knocking.

08:04.851 --> 08:07.186
I wouldn't wanna shag anyone
out here.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.722
Imagine getting bit
when you're mid-shag.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.158
Is that how you have sex?
That was shit.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.361
I'm not keen on the view,
but I'd love to buck Marty out here

08:15.428 --> 08:16.829
and let the trees watch.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.998
You think anyone's
gonna shag out here?

08:19.065 --> 08:20.666
The lads will shag anywhere.

08:20.733 --> 08:24.570
If I was shagging out here, I would
get emotional as he was inside.

08:24.637 --> 08:28.007
Not only would you be outside
with the wilderness.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.077
You'd stare into the stars
as you were having an orgasm.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.410
It doesn't get better.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.250
"Welcome to Kavos, yous a..."

08:37.316 --> 08:39.818
"Yous all."
I know what it says, man.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.520
"You've got a night off
to enjoy yourselves."

08:42.587 --> 08:44.891
"But make sure you behave. Anna."

08:44.957 --> 08:47.493
(all cheer)

08:47.560 --> 08:49.528
Shall we have a shot? Shots!

08:49.595 --> 08:52.498
I can't believe Anna
is giving the night off.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.600
What the fuck's wrong with her?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.970
Remember what you say
when you do a shot? Yamas!

08:58.037 --> 09:01.374
On three. One, two, three.
(all) Yamas!

09:02.675 --> 09:04.610
(all gag)

09:04.677 --> 09:07.647
This is the worst drink

09:07.713 --> 09:09.849
I have ever tried.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.685
(all shout)

09:12.752 --> 09:13.886
Yamas!

09:13.953 --> 09:15.955
(all laugh)

09:17.290 --> 09:19.292
One shot of Ouzo
and he's spewing up.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.762
He's gonna have to sort that
if he wants to hang with the girls.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.998
What's happened with your hand?
I'm going to the hospital.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.334
I've got ice on it.
I've done my Ouzo,

09:28.401 --> 09:31.037
but no word of a lie,
my hand is in fucking bits.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.506
I need to get to a doctor's,
rapid.

09:33.572 --> 09:37.209
All right. Bye!
Shall we go to the pool?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.378
(all shout)

09:39.445 --> 09:41.881
Scott's nashed to the doctor's,

09:41.948 --> 09:45.418
so we're going straight
into that pool cos I fucking stink.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.853
(all shout)

09:54.293 --> 09:56.629
Gary, what are you doing,
you raccoon?

09:56.696 --> 09:59.532
Fucking fucker.
(laughs)

09:59.598 --> 10:01.167
playing in the pool is fun.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.804
We need to get serious, get ready
and get out, cos I wanna get peevy.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.681
It's getting weird.
It's only me and you left.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.451
Scott can't be away that long.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.287
We've lost Aaron,
so Scott best get back here,

10:21.354 --> 10:24.357
cos the boys' numbers
are looking slim.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.325
Aaron and me are best mates,

10:26.392 --> 10:29.395
so for me, it's horrible,
him not being here.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.501
I never thought I'd be saying this,
but I'm so pleased Marty's here.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.969
If not, it would just be me.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.576
How're you feeling about Marty,
Chloe?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.745
So,
about the me and Marty situation,

10:45.811 --> 10:48.347
basically,
we just argue all the time.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.349
I wanna have a good time with yous.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.785
I do like him.
It would bother us if he pulled.

10:52.852 --> 10:57.023
I do like Marty, but all we do
is fight and we're not going out.

10:57.089 --> 11:01.494
Tonight, I'm just gonna hang
with the girls and have no drama.

11:01.560 --> 11:06.265
Right, you little radge packets,
I haven't been this happy in ages

11:06.332 --> 11:08.267
and I think it's the Kavos air.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.102
I might go on the pull tonight.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.939
I feel like I'll never be the same
with Aaron after what he did.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.742
Walking out on us because he
found out a big thing

11:16.809 --> 11:18.611
without even talking to us.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.080
I'm still angry at Aaron.
I hated Magaluf.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.949
and I'm determined
to make Kavos much better.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.785
Tonight, I'm not holding back.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.755
I'm fucking fuming.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.258
What is wrong?

11:32.324 --> 11:34.627
You are mugging me off!

11:34.693 --> 11:36.629
I don't why I liked this bird.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.899
Fuck! What are you doing, man?
The girl's gone fucking nuts.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.334
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

11:45.004 --> 11:45.204
.

11:47.706 --> 11:47.907
.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.755
It's the first night in Kavos.
It's gonna be fucking sick.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.629
Just got into Future
and I am literally amazed.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.998
This place is fucking unbelievable.

12:22.842 --> 12:26.745
Someone pour me a drink,
cos tonight I'm going akka.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.653
(all cheer)

12:34.720 --> 12:36.689
This party is proper belter.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.866
There is no sign of Scott,
but even if it's just me and Marty,

12:46.932 --> 12:48.367
we can have a wicked time.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.878
As much as I wanted to pull
to get Aaron back,

12:58.944 --> 13:02.448
I can't go through with it,
especially the fact he's not here.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.959
Chloe doesn't want to
give Marty attention

13:14.026 --> 13:16.428
and it's perfect
cos Aaron isn't here.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.765
So all of us girls can have
so much fun without any of the boys.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.479
I'm talking to the lasses
and I look over

13:33.546 --> 13:35.581
and Holly is chatting with the boys.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.385
Why does he always speak to her
and not me? It really annoys us.

13:44.924 --> 13:48.694
I've not said anything to Chloe.
She's been ruining my nights out.

13:48.761 --> 13:52.765
Tonight, I'm gonna ignore her again.
Otherwise, there's gonna be murders.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.308
The rest of the squad have no idea
what's happened to me hand,

14:02.374 --> 14:05.044
but I'm still looking fucking mint
as usual.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.946
Get me in the club
and get me a drink.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.886
I might have one hand in a cast,
but I'm ambi-fucking-dextrous.

14:13.953 --> 14:17.056
I'll have a pint in that hand
and a bird sitting on that.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.392
Oh!

14:22.962 --> 14:24.863
Boo-yah. Scott's come bouncing in

14:24.930 --> 14:27.866
with this big daft thing
on his hand.

14:33.372 --> 14:37.276
Scott has turned up. As if he was
gonna miss the first night in Kavos.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.283
First Aaron,
now Scott's gonna have to go

14:44.350 --> 14:47.186
cos of his big daft arm.
There's gonna be no lads left.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.025
I'm gonna miss these dippies.

14:53.092 --> 14:57.196
But for now, I'm gonna make my last
night in Kavos fucking lethal.

15:11.043 --> 15:15.080
I'm starting to miss Marty and all
I wanna do is have a good night.

15:19.652 --> 15:23.289
Chloe's backed us into a corner
and asking how I feel about her.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.723
This will not end well.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.932
Right now,
I've got no feelings for Chloe.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.770
I don't want anything to fucking
do with her. She needs to nash on.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.251
I'm trying to be nice
and be friends,

15:52.318 --> 15:56.021
but he won't shake my hand.
He's walked off. I'm fucking fuming.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.590
(indistinct)

16:00.759 --> 16:03.262
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.797
(screams)

16:07.066 --> 16:08.901
Chloe's going in on Marty.

16:08.967 --> 16:12.471
Next, she's trying to punch me?
What the fuck are you doing?

16:18.210 --> 16:23.415
Kick-off Chloe has arrived in Kavos.
Thought I'd left that in Magaluf.

16:28.687 --> 16:31.457
Chloe's done it again,
ruined a wicked night.

16:31.523 --> 16:34.426
Let's get back
before she kicks off at someone else.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.168
Get back to the villa
and I need pizza,

16:43.235 --> 16:46.438
but I'm not done with Marty.
He's been a proper prick.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.709
You fucking fat cunt!

16:50.776 --> 16:52.478
I've just walked into the villa

16:52.544 --> 16:55.614
and already, Chloe is chucking
fucking pizza in my face.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.216
Fucking hell!

16:57.282 --> 16:59.585
She's throwing pizza off me
straight away!

16:59.651 --> 17:01.153
I cannot stand her.

17:09.294 --> 17:12.397
Chloe is accusing me
of flirting with Marty.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.367
I've barely spoken two words to him.
What the fuck is she going on about?

17:16.435 --> 17:18.704
Why every time is it me?
Every time.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.973
Cos every time I walk in,
you're speaking to him.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.842
So what if she's speaking to him?

17:23.909 --> 17:26.345
First Chloe's gone for me
for no reason.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.881
Now she's saying
Holly's flirting with Marty.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.582
The girl's gone fucking mad.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.685
I have your fucking back.
Do you, though?

17:33.752 --> 17:37.456
You've sworn a million times
that you never...

17:37.523 --> 17:39.691
Cos he hasn't got nowt
to say abut you!

17:39.758 --> 17:42.895
Holly is supposed to be
one of the girls.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.197
So why is she
hanging around with him more?

17:45.264 --> 17:48.567
Marty hasn't even done anything.
I'm your fucking mate!

17:48.634 --> 17:53.705
And you're starting with me
every fucking time!

17:53.772 --> 17:55.908
You are mugging me off!

17:55.974 --> 17:58.977
This is getting beyond a joke now.
What is wrong with her?

17:59.044 --> 18:01.246
She has got a point.
(indistinct)

18:01.313 --> 18:04.216
Chloe's going in on Holly
and it doesn't make sense.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.084
Holly would never go near Marty.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.887
She's done nothing to make
Chloe think she would.

18:11.723 --> 18:15.494
I'm absolutely bongoed and all I can
hear is them radgies kicking off.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.229
Fuck that. I'm getting a kip.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.498
You say things to Scott.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.068
He was like, "I like it."
Does he fuck like it? Does he fuck?

18:23.135 --> 18:27.306
Marty's been talking to me like
shit. No way I'm letting this go.

18:27.372 --> 18:31.810
No, you're not going anywhere, man.
Get the fuck out of our room, man.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.345
Please go to your area.

18:33.412 --> 18:37.382
I am baffled. I don't know why
I used to like this bird.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.285
Listen, get upstairs
and go to fucking bed, right?

18:40.352 --> 18:43.088
I'm losing my patience with Chloe.
We're all drunk,

18:43.155 --> 18:44.623
but she needs to go to bed.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.527
Do you think I give a shit about you
kicking off on Marty, man?

18:48.594 --> 18:51.163
I wanna chat with Marty.
I'm fucking raging.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.465
What has this
got to do with you, Gary?

18:53.532 --> 18:56.568
Go on!
What the fuck are you doing, man?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.971
(all shout, argue)

19:00.639 --> 19:03.609
You're a man. You're a fucking man.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.210
Chloe's now swinging away.

19:05.277 --> 19:08.180
All I'm trying to do
is calm the situation down.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.749
(shouts)
Chloe. Chloe. Chloe.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.485
(shouts)

19:13.552 --> 19:16.688
Rule 101
of how to get a boy to like you.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.290
Act like a fucking psycho.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.826
You launched a pizza at his face.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.262
Holly went in. You started on her.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.331
I've lost the plot tonight,
but I blame it all on Marty.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.767
He's given us no attention.
He's been rude.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.069
He's really hurt my feelings.

19:31.136 --> 19:32.704
...he'd be fucked.

19:32.771 --> 19:37.409
Chloe, you should apologise
to Holly, though. OK? Promise?

19:37.476 --> 19:39.645
(coughs)
Promise?

19:39.711 --> 19:43.181
Chloe is on a fucking mad one,
so I'm hid behind a kitchen unit

19:43.248 --> 19:45.083
so she cannot chuck anything else.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.385
Go on, Martin.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.621
(laughs)

19:49.688 --> 19:51.623
I feel safe now.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.325
Fucking safe.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.333
I can understand why
Marty doesn't want to go there.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.969
This is getting beyond a joke.
It's ridiculous.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.172
(cries)

20:18.650 --> 20:22.020
There is something about Holly
that Chloe is jealous of.

20:22.087 --> 20:25.724
I don't know why, but anything
about Holly and Marty annoys her.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.097
Tonight started mint,
but it's ended shit as usual.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.299
I can't be arsed
with any more off Chloe,

20:34.366 --> 20:36.268
so I'm gonna sleep in the lads' room.

20:42.674 --> 20:46.378
Holly wants to sleep downstairs,
so I'm gonna have to sleep upstairs.

20:46.445 --> 20:51.083
I'm just gonna have to bite my tongue
and Chloe better shut the fuck up.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.884
Sha-ting!

20:52.951 --> 20:56.121
First night in Kavos
and it was fucking shit.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.229
Who's your fucking baby!

21:04.296 --> 21:06.698
It's Sophie!
Oh, my God!

21:06.765 --> 21:08.834
Gary and Chantelle have kissed.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.005
Great. One more person to hate me.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.073
(all) Geordie Shore. Why-aye!

21:17.476 --> 21:17.676
.

21:20.212 --> 21:20.412
.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.905
Be honest, you like
this room better, don't you?

21:46.972 --> 21:49.141
(laughs) No, I don't.

21:49.207 --> 21:50.542
Fuck the girls' room.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.545
I'm not used to waking up
next to girls I haven't banged.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.580
This is shit.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.683
I'm embarrassed about Holly.

21:57.749 --> 22:02.521
That was really bad, Chloe.
Like, that has to stop.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.857
Everyone knows me.
I never, ever get embarrassed.

22:05.924 --> 22:09.327
But this morning, I've woke up
and I'm absolutely mortified.

22:09.394 --> 22:12.764
Holly, in a million years,
would never, ever get with Marty.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.099
The kick-off Chloe.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.335
Was way overdramatic
for what actually...

22:17.402 --> 22:19.838
I know Holly would never, ever
go near Martin,

22:19.905 --> 22:23.375
but I think he fancies her. I should
never have had a go at Holly.

22:26.344 --> 22:29.848
I've woke up this morning feeling
last night I had a wicked night,

22:29.915 --> 22:33.452
but what the fuck is Holly doing
in the next bed? Did I blast her?

22:33.518 --> 22:37.189
Well, our first night in Kavos
didn't exactly go to plan, did it?

22:37.255 --> 22:39.958
No, it never does.
I know Chloe's hurting and stuff,

22:40.025 --> 22:41.927
but like...
She's not, man.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.729
...she wouldn't go on like that.

22:43.795 --> 22:47.733
I literally cannot believe
the way Chloe went on last night.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.101
It was fucking mental.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.269
I am her mate
and I wanna be her mate.

22:51.336 --> 22:54.840
Every day, I fucking... I have
her back. I try and give her advice.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.575
And I get it chucked in my face.

22:56.641 --> 22:59.811
It's ridiculous of Chloe to think
I'd go near Marty.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.881
I see him like a brother,
not someone I wanna sleep with.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.517
She's spoiling the night,
every single night.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.186
Every night, it's always her.
Yeah, I agree.

23:08.253 --> 23:12.758
Fucking clown egg.
Absolute egg of clown.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.926
(all chuckle)

23:24.236 --> 23:27.539
Even though Greece's finest doc
has put this on my arm,

23:27.606 --> 23:31.476
I think it's time for me to get back
to the Toon and get it sorted out.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.881
Cos there's no way I'm trying to
finger birds with that bad boy.

23:35.947 --> 23:39.417
Well, you'll be missed.
Have a nice operation.

23:39.484 --> 23:43.355
We're sad Scott's gotta leave, but he
does have to sort his hand out.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.260
I didn't wanna go at all,

23:48.326 --> 23:51.096
but it's time for Scotty T
to check out of Kavos.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.465
Au rev-fucking-oir.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.369
I am gutted to see Scott leave,

23:57.435 --> 24:00.038
but us lads need some time
away from the villa.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.208
After all that shit with Chloe,
Holly is coming with us.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.346
It's still awkward with me and Chloe,

24:08.413 --> 24:11.716
so today, I'm gonna hang out
with the lads. Sorry, girls.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.955
Right,
my and Marty against the visitors.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.493
Holly won't see the ball.

24:23.929 --> 24:27.732
I do feel bad for leaving the girls,
but I need time away from Chloe.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.402
Hopefully,
she's realised that she hurt us.

24:30.468 --> 24:34.172
It's weird, cos I feel like
I do class Chloe as my little sister.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.641
If this keeps going on,
she's gonna lose me.

24:36.708 --> 24:41.246
Last night, imagine Chloe didn't
do what she did. Mint night.

24:41.313 --> 24:45.517
Chloe's starting to spoil nights.
She starts arguments for no reason.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.452
And it's starting to annoy people.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.921
I'm done with her.
I don't want to be friends.

24:49.988 --> 24:54.059
After last night, I cannot
be around Chloe when she's pissed.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.428
So from now on,
I just need to go out,

24:56.494 --> 24:58.763
ignore her,
focus on pulling wicked fanny.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.933
Don't know what you want to do.
Let's go do some shopping.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.368
No, no, no.

25:03.435 --> 25:06.805
Listen. A pint and a game of pool
does not include shopping.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.974
We invite Holly out with the lads

25:09.040 --> 25:11.843
and the first chance she gets,
she's buying shit.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.746
This is why we don't bring girls.
Amazing. Thank you.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.182
I wanna inject harmony
into the house.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.417
So I've decided
to buy the girls a gift.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.586
What've you bought?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.188
Dreamcatchers.
Why?

25:23.255 --> 25:27.459
Dreamcatchers give positive energy.
Right. Come on then.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.561
Holly,
you did push the boat out there.

25:34.733 --> 25:37.369
Holly's with the lads
to get away from Chloe,

25:37.435 --> 25:40.005
so the girls are gonna
spend the day in the salon.

25:40.071 --> 25:43.141
What does this do?
They remove the dead skin.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.610
They don't have teeth, do they?
No.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.179
I am in desperate need
of getting my nails done,

25:48.246 --> 25:51.716
but they've got fish that eat
fungus off your feet. What a belter.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.119
We can't do it.
Yous are fucking pussies.

25:54.185 --> 25:56.321
It's like piranhas trying to attack.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.024
That's what I keep thinking.
It's piranhas.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.860
By the way, fish,
I've got athlete's foot.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.161
(screams)

26:04.396 --> 26:07.132
I thought maybe we'd get a massage
and our nails done

26:07.198 --> 26:08.466
and have a girly day.

26:08.533 --> 26:12.771
What I didn't want was Chantelle
and Chloe screaming their arses off,

26:12.837 --> 26:14.572
getting their feet ate by fish.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.975
(both shriek, laugh)

26:17.042 --> 26:20.078
Erm, Chloe, how do you feel
about the Holly situation?

26:20.145 --> 26:23.815
I feel bad. There's no need to go on
the way I did. I feel embarrassed.

26:23.882 --> 26:28.186
I don't blame Holly whatsoever for
not wanting to hang with us today.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.256
If I was her, I'd wanna stay
as far as possible from Chloe.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.659
I'm so stressed out.
Everything's getting on top of us.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.495
Maybe if you didn't
kick off as much.

26:37.562 --> 26:40.732
I wanna get back to where it was,
but too much has happened.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.101
If Chloe keeps going on
the way she has been,

26:43.168 --> 26:46.004
it's not just gonna be Holly
she's falling out with.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.106
And that's not
gonna be a nice house.

26:48.173 --> 26:51.209
If you like him,
you have to start acting different.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.087
Thank you.

27:02.153 --> 27:03.989
Hi.

27:04.055 --> 27:06.124
I'm walking over
and I can see Holly.

27:06.191 --> 27:08.860
Shit! Please don't be angry with us.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.495
I bought some dreamcatchers

27:10.562 --> 27:14.399
because they trap the negative energy

27:14.466 --> 27:17.736
and that bead in the middle
lets the good energy through.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.572
How do you know?
It says on the back. (laughs)

27:20.638 --> 27:22.307
I need one. Got one for me?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.609
I got one for all the girls
and Nathan.

27:24.676 --> 27:27.746
Chloe's not mentioned last night.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.647
I bought her a present

27:29.714 --> 27:32.484
in the hope that she's realised
she needs to change.

27:32.550 --> 27:35.186
Pass me the orange, Chloe.
I'll have any.

27:35.253 --> 27:38.690
After everything last night,
Holly's bought me a present.

27:38.757 --> 27:42.160
I was wrong and I hope she can
forgive us and we can be friends.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.129
(phone rings)
Oh! Phone!

27:44.195 --> 27:47.899
Aw, is someone at work?
Can't be working tonight, surely.

27:47.966 --> 27:53.338
Now I've got a feeling that tonight
is gonna be a very good night.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.472
Hello?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.243
Hi, Anna.

28:01.146 --> 28:02.447
I know. I'm sorry.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.116
I know. I'm sorry, Anna!

28:05.183 --> 28:07.919
It's Anna and I'm in big trouble
for last night.

28:07.986 --> 28:10.922
Suck on this, Anna.
Ah, it didn't come out.

28:15.093 --> 28:16.628
(sighs) OK, Anna.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.564
Bye. Love you.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.666
I'm on a booze ban.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.002
I think that's the best
for me anyway.

28:24.069 --> 28:27.138
Well, rather you than me.
I don't really care.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.441
Sucks to be you tonight.
Sucks to be me.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.342
For once, I'm agreeing with Anna.

28:31.409 --> 28:35.246
Tonight I am not drinking because
that is what causes the problems.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.060
After last night, everyone's wanting
a bit of quiet time.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.628
We could all do with a boost.

28:55.767 --> 28:59.304
Who's your fucking baby?!
(all shriek)

29:00.805 --> 29:04.142
I'd recognise that radgy voice
anywhere. It's Sophie!

29:04.209 --> 29:05.944
Where's all the baboons?

29:06.010 --> 29:08.046
Guess who's fucking back.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.881
(screams)
Oh, my God!

29:11.082 --> 29:13.651
(screaming)

29:13.718 --> 29:17.689
I'm absolutely buzzing. She gives
the best advice. She's like my ma.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.160
Sophie and Charlotte
are best friends.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.229
Me and Charlotte are not speaking.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.132
That means me and Sophie
are not speaking.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.533
Wicked.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.702
Hi, everyone!

29:30.768 --> 29:32.637
Oh, my God.

29:34.906 --> 29:38.042
So, Anna sent me to Kavos
cos she's a worker down.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.678
Well, I'll tell you something, Anna.
Fuck you.

29:40.745 --> 29:45.216
And fuck work because I'm here to
see the family and fucking party.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.486
Everyone needs a t-shirt.
Paint party tonight.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.622
I love Kavos!

29:50.688 --> 29:52.857
Oh-ho! Whoa!

29:52.924 --> 29:56.861
Sophie's turned up and she's told us
we're going to a paint party.

29:56.928 --> 29:58.563
Tonight is gonna be amazing.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.600
These are minging, these, like.
Everyone get one here.

30:02.667 --> 30:06.137
Please, look what it says. I'm dead.
"I Love Kavos."

30:06.204 --> 30:08.039
These t-shirts are fucking radge.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.675
How am I gonna get any fanny
wearing these?

30:14.646 --> 30:18.216
It's mad cos me and Sophie,
after the whole Charlotte thing,

30:18.283 --> 30:20.118
Sophie and Charlotte are friends.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.320
We haven't spoke
since she came in here.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.722
The only thing worrying me
about tonight

30:24.789 --> 30:28.560
is me and Sophie haven't spoke yet
and I know that time is gonna come.

30:28.626 --> 30:31.763
If Sophie has a go at me,
I will literally stand like this.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.698
(chuckles)
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.801
Sophie being back is good,
but probably not for Gaz.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.237
Cos she is Charlotte's best mate,

30:39.304 --> 30:41.539
so there could
be murders on tonight.

30:41.606 --> 30:45.443
Looking well.
What have I done there?

30:46.444 --> 30:48.079
(laughs)

30:49.614 --> 30:53.284
I'm very, very glad to be back.
Very, very glad, yeah.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.688
It's hard cos I've never
really been here without Charlotte,

30:56.754 --> 30:59.457
so that's hard and I didn't know
how that would be.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.660
I'm sat upstairs with all the girls
and I know at some point,

31:02.727 --> 31:06.598
Sophie's gonna find out about
the kiss. She's not gonna be happy.

31:06.664 --> 31:09.000
Right, so who's single?

31:09.067 --> 31:10.935
All of us.
All the girls.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.571
All the girls.
Marns, what happened then?

31:13.638 --> 31:16.307
He wasn't treating her
like a girlfriend.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.176
He was just so weird, Sophie.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.678
I tried to hold his hand.
He'd walk away.

31:20.745 --> 31:24.048
And he was with Gary
more than he was with me.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.184
I'm telling Sophie what happened,

31:26.251 --> 31:29.487
but right now, I wanna focus
on tonight and forget about him.

31:37.528 --> 31:38.863
In a caravan.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.367
Sophie's my cousin
and she's asking about Gary

31:42.433 --> 31:46.204
and if he's been getting with people
and I feel like I should be honest.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.273
Gary and Chantelle have kissed.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.810
Now I'm just waiting
for the tumbleweed.

31:54.812 --> 31:55.880
(bell tolls)

31:55.947 --> 31:58.650
This is so awkward.
I don't know where to look.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.785
So I'm just gonna look at the roof.

32:03.921 --> 32:06.090
Was it more than once?
Twice.

32:06.157 --> 32:09.360
But it was a drunken kiss.
It meant nothing.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.530
This news about Chantelle and Gary
disgusts us.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.867
I don't know what to do.
I don't know whether I kick off.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.569
But right now, inside, I'm hurting.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.139
Chantelle.
I know, but we've made it clear.

32:21.205 --> 32:25.843
I've made it clear. I was drunk
and it's not happening again.

32:25.910 --> 32:29.180
I would've like to tell her myself.
Shock, She's not happy.

32:29.247 --> 32:32.116
That was your best friend.
You're loyal with friends.

32:32.183 --> 32:35.420
She wasn't my best friend.
I said that...

32:35.486 --> 32:38.890
Does that mean that all the time
you fancied him?

32:38.956 --> 32:42.493
I couldn't kiss anyone
I didn't fancy.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.662
I made a daft mistake
and kissed Gary.

32:44.729 --> 32:48.599
I'm not mentioning names, but others
have had his cock in their mouth.

32:48.666 --> 32:52.303
But I don't wanna talk about it now.
I wanna have a good night.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.572
I haven't done this in a long time.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.141
Whatever's happened,
speak about it later.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.610
I can't be arsed for arguments.

32:59.677 --> 33:04.015
Tonight, we are gonna go out,
Geordie Shore style, like a family,

33:04.082 --> 33:07.885
have a good time. Otherwise,
they'll have me to deal with.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.388
Being at this paint party's
gonna be unreal.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.324
Do one, man.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.627
Right now, I hate Gary.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.564
It's a good time to be alive.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.632
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

33:23.968 --> 33:24.168
.

33:26.671 --> 33:26.871
.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.824
Sophie's back
and I'm absolutely buzzing.

33:46.891 --> 33:49.360
I'm ready to go out
and get fucking on it.

33:52.797 --> 33:54.866
We've arrived and it's packed.

33:54.932 --> 33:58.002
Being at this paint party's
gonna be unreal.

34:13.251 --> 34:16.254
Me and Gaz are in the brunt of it.
We're bouncing all over.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.822
He's gone fucking in.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.529
Being at this party's so much fun.

34:24.594 --> 34:27.965
I feel like a bucket of colourful
cum's gone all over my face.

34:32.969 --> 34:36.706
Marnie, sexy bum.
Marnie, Marnie, sexy bum.

34:36.774 --> 34:40.545
(all) Marnie, sexy bum.
Marnie, Marnie, sexy bum.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.681
It's mint to be back
and even better to see Marnie happy

34:43.748 --> 34:45.683
after everything what's happened.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.958
I'm on a booze ban after last night.
I think that's for the best.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.361
I'm gonna leave Marty alone
and behave.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.268
The Chloe and Marty situation
is still going on.

35:04.335 --> 35:06.804
I think, if she has any brain cell,

35:06.871 --> 35:09.607
she needs to leave it right now
before she gets hurt.

35:18.483 --> 35:21.118
Me and Gaz have come so far
since last time.

35:21.185 --> 35:24.322
All the shit that went down
after me and Charlotte,

35:24.388 --> 35:26.791
and to be where we are now
is fucking amazing.

35:34.265 --> 35:38.369
This paint party is probably
the best party I've ever been to.

35:38.436 --> 35:41.405
Me and Sophie on stage,
firing them paint guns,

35:41.472 --> 35:43.474
like there's no tomorrow.

35:48.079 --> 35:51.983
I found this absolute wicked bird
in the club and I'm gonna crack on

35:52.049 --> 35:53.651
with some of my best lines.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.367
I look over and Marty's pulled.

36:09.433 --> 36:11.769
It bothers us,
but I cannot kick off.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.472
I need a drama-free night.
It's a new me.

36:21.045 --> 36:23.614
I'm trying to have a good time,
but I can't ignore

36:23.681 --> 36:27.752
the whole Gary-Chantelle situation.
Why'd she neck on with him?

36:32.189 --> 36:35.793
Sophie's asking about Gary.
Fuck me, this is awkward.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.343
Why would she wanna hurt my friend?

36:52.410 --> 36:55.746
I have lost all trust in that girl.
Gary?

37:03.688 --> 37:05.623
Fuck me. It was just a kiss.

37:05.690 --> 37:09.527
I shouldn't have to explain myself
to anyone but Charlotte.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.971
The more I hear about
this Chantelle and Gary situation,

37:20.037 --> 37:22.106
the more infuriated I'm getting.

37:22.173 --> 37:26.010
Now it's time to go to the
horse's mouth and speak to Gary.

37:27.144 --> 37:31.616
I can see Sophie walking over. Shit.
This isn't gonna be pleasant.

37:36.954 --> 37:39.757
He's just finished with Charlotte,
and he's trying

37:39.824 --> 37:43.461
to get in Chantelle's knickers.
It shows what kind of disgusting,

37:43.527 --> 37:45.329
awful person that boy is.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.005
I was pissed.
I necked on with Chantelle.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.274
I didn't do it on purpose
to piss Charlotte off.

38:04.415 --> 38:08.753
It's like an argument with Charlotte.
Charlotte's head is in Sophie's body.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.763
He doesn't care about
the relationship he had,

38:18.829 --> 38:20.765
about breaking her heart.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.601
This boy is a heartless bastard.

38:33.844 --> 38:36.614
Charlotte this, Charlotte that.
Shut up, man.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.754
I'm getting angry.
I can feel the venom building up.

38:49.493 --> 38:53.364
Ooh, you fucking swilled us.
I'm covered in paint anyway. Idiot.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.132
(shouting)

38:56.200 --> 38:59.704
I kicked off. I'm thinking about
all the times he's hurt my friend.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.545
Sophie is flipping out at Gary.

39:07.611 --> 39:10.614
There's drinks flying all over.
This is a nightmare.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.883
(shouting, arguing)

39:14.285 --> 39:16.987
I didn't see you in Charlotte's face,
kicking off,

39:17.054 --> 39:20.725
when she did something wrong.
But it's all good shouting at Gary.

39:20.791 --> 39:21.926
Do one, man.

39:24.762 --> 39:27.698
I don't know how we are
ever gonna overcome this

39:27.765 --> 39:30.067
because right now, I hate Gary.

39:30.134 --> 39:32.136
(shouting, arguing)

39:34.572 --> 39:37.908
I was having a wicked night
until Sophie came over.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.878
You know what it is? Fuck this.
Get me back to that villa.

39:43.447 --> 39:46.684
Everything has went worse tonight.
Gaz is leaving,

39:46.751 --> 39:49.854
so I'm gonna take this naughty bird
back to the villa.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.957
Sophie's walked into this house
with one aim,

39:53.023 --> 39:55.126
to turn everybody against us.

39:55.192 --> 39:59.296
Right, she's done it with Marnie.
She's done it with Chloe.

39:59.363 --> 40:00.965
She's doing it with Nathan.

40:01.031 --> 40:04.301
I'm sitting in the taxi,
trying to neck on with this bird,

40:04.368 --> 40:06.971
and Gaz is banging on
about fucking Sophie.

40:07.037 --> 40:10.274
Howay, mate. We are pals,
but there's a fucking limit.

40:18.816 --> 40:22.653
I know Sophie was pissed off,
but all this drama over a daft kiss?

40:22.720 --> 40:25.556
And now I feel like shit.
I thought this was a family.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.965
I can't believe it. The drinking ban
has actually worked.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.568
It's all kicked off
and none of it is my fault.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.036
My ma would be so proud.

40:40.437 --> 40:43.774
Not only was paint being thrown,
so were a few drinks.

40:43.841 --> 40:46.877
It's time to get back to the villa
and sort this shit out.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.985
Tell you what,
this is fucking weird.

40:55.052 --> 40:58.189
No pizza in my face,
no chicken nuggets in my face.

40:58.255 --> 41:01.859
I'm just walking in the villa,
going to bed and going for a shag.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.527
It's a good time to be alive.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.733
Tonight has gone to shit.
I'm gonna go to bed

41:09.800 --> 41:12.903
before Sophie gets back
and attempts to take my head off.

41:14.872 --> 41:18.576
Apart from the Sophie and Gaz thing,
the party was fucking amazing.

41:18.642 --> 41:22.046
And I'm ending the night
with a shag. Good night.

41:27.918 --> 41:29.353
Nathan, get Marnie out.

41:30.754 --> 41:32.423
Oh, Jesus.

41:32.489 --> 41:34.525
Open the fucking door.

41:34.592 --> 41:39.463
We get back and everyone's smashed,
but Marnie is absolutely twatted,

41:39.530 --> 41:43.067
and after everything that's
happened, she deserved a good night.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.336
You are pissed.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.771
Night, night.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.574
I don't know what Marty's up to,

41:50.641 --> 41:52.810
but right now,
I don't give a flying fuck.

41:52.877 --> 41:55.045
We're gonna have fun
in the girls' room.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.748
(shouting)

41:59.750 --> 42:02.620
I've had a shit night.
Sophie's had a massive go at us

42:02.686 --> 42:05.890
and then it all kicks off.
All I wanna do is get some sleep.

42:08.726 --> 42:11.328
Me and the girls are in the bedroom.

42:11.395 --> 42:15.132
Holly's washing us and the water
is going everywhere.

42:16.233 --> 42:18.202
(laughter)

42:18.269 --> 42:22.139
The next thing I know, we're
butt naked, sliding on the floor.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.208
(laughter)

42:25.676 --> 42:29.847
Last time I had this much fun naked
is when I was getting bucked.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.384
Right, Holly went the furthest.

42:33.450 --> 42:37.688
Despite all the drama going on,
we have ended the night brilliantly.

42:37.755 --> 42:40.624
We're playing slip and slide.
Everyone's naked.

42:40.691 --> 42:43.627
We're going to bed a happy family.
Well, almost.

42:47.831 --> 42:51.702
I enjoyed my first night. Love yous.
Love you, too.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.771
L-Y. Kiss, kiss. X-O-X-O.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.973
Thanks for a bed
at the top of the stairs.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.276
Night, Holly.
Night, Nathan. Love you.

43:07.184 --> 43:08.719
We need a bit of excitement.

43:08.786 --> 43:10.988
(laughs)
Aaron's just walked in.

43:11.055 --> 43:14.725
Oh, no, no, no.
I am not prepared for this.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.560
The boys are back.

43:16.627 --> 43:19.563
(vomits)
Nathan is in a bad way.

43:21.398 --> 43:23.100
Here's Nathan!

43:23.167 --> 43:25.602
(all cheer)

43:25.669 --> 43:28.472
Are we together? Are we not?
I don't fucking know.

43:29.573 --> 43:32.142
Why would you be so nasty?
I'm telling the truth.

43:32.209 --> 43:35.946
Fuck off, you fucking nacker.
I want out of this house.

44:01.438 --> 44:01.638
.
