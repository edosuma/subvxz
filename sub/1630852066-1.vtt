00:22.856 --> 00:26.109
Most people have no concept
of what warfare looks like.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.073
Most people have no idea that sometimes
you have to starve your enemy.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.950
Sometimes it's good that they get sick.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.410
Sometimes it's good
that they don't have medical supplies.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.667
It's gonna look unfamiliar
to somebody who's seeing it

00:42.167 --> 00:43.794
that hasn't experienced it.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.717
Every Navy SEAL should hope to go to war.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.721
And that's a double-edged sword.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.183
You need to be able
to turn that on and turn it off.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.353
Get ready.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.109
I think we're pulling up there. Aren't we?

01:07.192 --> 01:09.528
This whole story of us, you know,

01:09.611 --> 01:12.823
helping to eliminate ISIS
from their stronghold in Iraq,

01:12.906 --> 01:14.741
it's kind of overshadowed.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.537
What actually happened out there
and how things ended,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.498
after everything we've gone through
together as a platoon,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.375
it was a tough pill to swallow.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.169
All right, what do we got?

01:26.170 --> 01:28.505
It's like fuckin' sniper central.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.840
Yep.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.842
We're there to kill bad guys.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.219
That's, like, what we train for.

01:35.387 --> 01:39.308
But some guys just wanna go do it
for the wrong reasons.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.693
Are you special warfare operator
Edward R. Gallagher,

01:49.776 --> 01:51.195
the accused in this case?

01:52.154 --> 01:53.864
Yes, sir.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.867
We turn now to the Navy SEAL on trial

01:56.950 --> 01:58.118
for murder and war crimes.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.245
Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.414
He's accused of killing
a wounded ISIS captive.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.293
Also faces two attempted murder charges
in the shooting of two civilians in…

02:06.376 --> 02:08.502
Gallagher, who denies all charges,

02:08.586 --> 02:11.006
was turned in by members of his own unit.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.802
It's a very rare occurrence that SEALs
are going against one of their own.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.681
It was completely against our nature
and our training,

02:19.765 --> 02:23.477
but we had to stop Eddie
from doing this on another deployment.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.229
We were never taught that

02:25.312 --> 02:28.315
our leadership was gonna be
the ones committing war crimes.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.818
This has never happened
in the history of the Navy SEALs.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.656
We knew that it was gonna get really ugly.

02:35.739 --> 02:38.492
But we had no idea that
this was gonna become a public spectacle.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.204
Gallagher's legal team
saying it wasn't murder. It was mutiny.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.248
I'm innocent. I love you.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.418
They had this whole kangaroo court
with this justice system of their own.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.712
No evidence. No proof.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.258
I was not gonna sit back
and just let them railroad us.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.427
Long live the real brotherhood
and free Eddie!

02:59.012 --> 03:01.598
A stunning twist at the trial
of a decorated Navy SEAL.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.642
Corey Scott changed his story

03:03.725 --> 03:05.686
in a bombshell moment
at Gallagher's trial.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.897
I didn't see any of that
coming out of Corey Scott.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.192
His testimony
completely upended everything.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.402
I'm a United States Navy SEAL.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.988
I'm trained for war,
not this little courtroom fiasco.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.907
This is a clash of two cultures:

03:18.991 --> 03:21.410
One that wants brotherhood and silence,

03:22.244 --> 03:24.204
and one that wants accountability.

03:26.957 --> 03:31.461
The idea that we're going to
drop our moral standards to fight a war,

03:32.129 --> 03:33.964
we're well beyond that time.

03:35.674 --> 03:39.428
These people that say
we should just let the dogs off the chain,

03:39.511 --> 03:41.471
you know, we're different than that.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.016
We hold ourselves to a higher standard
because we can.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.021
We're not Boy Scouts. We're not saints.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.899
We do a dirty job.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.238
I'm willing to do bad things to bad people
in order to protect the people at home.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.660
You fight monsters like that for so long,

04:04.745 --> 04:07.414
you start taking on
some of those characteristics as well

04:07.497 --> 04:08.665
to get the job done.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.628
You gotta become a monster
to kill a monster.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.513
We're here to train and go to war.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.556
I was like, "Hell yeah. Let's do this."

04:27.184 --> 04:29.770
These men were my family, my brothers.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.522
This bond of warfighters.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.986
You could just tell
that something was off.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.156
There was this undercurrent
in this platoon.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.121
How do you sleep at night
knowing what you did?

04:49.248 --> 04:51.542
I just saw it as good versus evil.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.168
It's that simple.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.774
Have a seat there, if you don't mind.

05:15.858 --> 05:16.900
Yep.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.201
All of our interviews get recorded,

05:26.285 --> 05:27.828
but that won't go into a case file.

05:27.911 --> 05:32.249
So this-- It's not like they could
look at this recording of the interview

05:32.332 --> 05:33.750
-or anything like that.
-Okay.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.044
This is something
we're obviously taking very serious

05:36.128 --> 05:37.212
'cause this is a huge issue.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.380
Dille: Mm-hmm.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.300
I'm gonna identify myself.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.761
Special Agent Joseph Warpinski.
I work for NCIS.

05:45.429 --> 05:48.557
-NCIS is kind of like the FBI of the Navy.
-Uh-huh.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.019
We are just
completely independent fact finders.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.855
We don't work for one side or the other
for any sort of issue.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.399
Our entire job
is to figure out what happened.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.611
Which team are you assigned to right now?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.446
Dille: Team 7.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.951
You know,
there's a group of people in the teams

06:08.035 --> 06:12.956
that is obviously against what I've done,
as far as coming forward.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.084
The labels are, you know,

06:16.168 --> 06:18.629
"snitch," "coward,"

06:18.712 --> 06:20.506
"pussy," all those things.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.841
Warpinski:
I can tell you that you obviously--

06:22.925 --> 06:25.260
I mean, you seem a little nervous.
And like, it's--

06:25.344 --> 06:27.221
The people we've talked to
regarding this case,

06:27.304 --> 06:28.805
it seems to be the general consensus.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.349
Like, this is a big deal.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.809
I'm not gonna try to downplay this
and tell you it's not.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.980
The Special Operations community,
it's very tight-knit,

06:37.064 --> 06:40.275
and there's some people that think
you should've handled it differently

06:40.359 --> 06:43.403
and not air out the dirty laundry,
I guess.

06:43.487 --> 06:47.366
So choosing to show your face
can be very controversial.

06:47.449 --> 06:51.078
Arrington: So like, if there were
to be a trial,

06:51.161 --> 06:53.914
are we all gonna be, like,
witnesses in a trial?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.499
Warpinski: You potentially could be.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.127
Arrington: Yeah, 'cause what I was
thinking is this could really fuck up…

07:00.337 --> 07:02.172
Like, I don't know
how this could all come out,

07:02.256 --> 07:04.174
but it could be skewed and make, like,

07:04.258 --> 07:07.469
everybody look like a bunch of rats.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.597
Things just escalated
out of everyone's control.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.975
It didn't cross our mind
that this was gonna be a scandal.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.812
Warpinski: It was a Law of Armed Conflict
violation that's been reported,

07:16.895 --> 07:19.273
and so that's what we're looking into.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.192
Vriens: Trying to keep my opinions
and my feelings out of it

07:22.276 --> 07:23.443
and just give you the facts.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.653
Look-- I mean, you gotta--

07:24.736 --> 07:26.989
Warpinski: Your opinions matter
because you have experience.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.699
-You were there. I mean, so--
-Yeah. Okay.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.158
Those things are actually relevant.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.535
And, like, I appreciate the fact

07:31.618 --> 07:34.246
that you're not trying to just sway this
one way or another, but--

07:34.329 --> 07:35.330
Vriens: Yeah.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.792
I never wanted to do this.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.628
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't be here at all.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.339
But we were… Kinda had our hand forced.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.259
You know, the only reason I'm here
is to set the record straight.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.054
Warpinski:
It's one individual in particular.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.433
Any idea who we're talking about?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.477
-Miller: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
-Okay.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.064
Warpinski: What I want to do is, I want
you to go through, tell me a story.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.027
I'm gonna need you to start
from the very beginning.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.329
I grew up in the foothills of Colorado.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.791
I remember playing
in the woods a lot with my brothers.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.089
Growing up, I wanted to be
a professional basketball player.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.009
So that was my thing for a while.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.097
I was 19 years old
when I decided to be a SEAL.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.895
You know, I think people are
kind of in awe of the training.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.356
And that sets the precedence for it.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.775
If you don't make it, guess what happens?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.236
Then, you know, obviously,
the history of the SEALs

08:47.319 --> 08:49.613
and operations that they've been on
and done,

08:50.697 --> 08:53.450
they make it seem
like something really hard to achieve.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.872
And I wanted to jump in the crucible
and see if I could cut it.

09:09.091 --> 09:12.135
When you first start the training pipeline
to become a SEAL,

09:12.219 --> 09:14.763
everything is focused
on physical training,

09:14.847 --> 09:17.724
getting ready for the drownproofing,
the water stuff.

09:19.101 --> 09:23.564
Me and a close buddy
would sneak into the pool at night

09:23.647 --> 09:25.566
and do drownproofing training.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.068
Had a couple, you know,
shallow-water blackouts

09:28.151 --> 09:29.945
with just me and him there.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.950
I spent two years preparing
and getting ready for BUD/S.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.663
BUD/S is
Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.290
Very physical.

09:41.373 --> 09:45.669
Long days, extremely stressful evolutions.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.965
Growing up, I was a bigger kid.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.135
I put on some weight before
I really grew up, so I got picked on.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.763
I always wished there was some big kid
who would stick up for me.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.809
And then one day I woke up,
looked in the mirror, and I was like,

10:00.893 --> 10:03.562
"Well, I think I am that big kid,
that straightedge.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.106
And it's time to start
laying the hammer down."

10:06.857 --> 10:10.485
I liked to fight. I liked aggression.
I liked to stand up for the little guy.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.365
Hearing about the SEAL teams, I was like,
"It'd be great to be in a community

10:15.449 --> 10:17.910
where everyone is made up
of those kinds of people."

10:19.453 --> 10:21.705
The people who make it through
SEAL training

10:21.788 --> 10:24.249
have to want it bad enough to die for it.

10:24.750 --> 10:29.755
BUD/S is designed to push the human body
further than it's capable of going.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.508
As the body starts to shut down,

10:32.591 --> 10:36.970
you're gonna look for every excuse
in the world to stop this process.

10:37.471 --> 10:41.767
The body is saying,
"I'm dying. Quit. Let me live."

10:42.267 --> 10:46.939
And you have to mentally say,
"No, I will not quit."

10:51.151 --> 10:54.613
One of my first instructors in BUD/S
was Eddie Gallagher.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.700
Eddie had a reputation
for being aggressive.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.496
He maintained a high level of fitness
and was able to push guys.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.875
Eddie Gallagher
was my first phase instructor.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.545
He was a really fast runner,

11:09.628 --> 11:11.964
kind of a no BS dude.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.344
The first time I saw Eddie
was first phase of BUD/S.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.806
And he carried himself
like a really hard-charging dude,

11:20.889 --> 11:22.015
and extremely fit.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.894
He was a beast,
an absolute physical beast,

11:26.436 --> 11:28.564
and I wanted to be like that.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.525
Eddie didn't do much talking.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.943
He would just show up

11:33.026 --> 11:36.029
and beat the shit out of everybody
and leave, for the most part.

11:37.948 --> 11:42.202
Mutual suffering in BUD/S
is a really strong bonding agent.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.997
And, you know, that carries with you
all the way through the teams.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.417
We started with around 300.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.004
There was five of us
that made it straight through.

11:53.589 --> 11:56.133
When you actually get assigned a team,
you're like,

11:56.216 --> 11:59.303
"Awesome.
This is where my career's gonna start.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.930
These are the guys I'm gonna serve with."

12:02.723 --> 12:05.225
I was really excited to go to SEAL Team 7.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.103
And I heard that Eddie Gallagher
was gonna be our chief.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.315
He had a good reputation.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.776
He was well respected
by master chiefs, everyone.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.780
He got SEAL of the year,
multiple bronze stars.

12:19.573 --> 12:24.119
A Boy Scout is, you know,
someone who has, like, a good uniform,

12:24.203 --> 12:26.997
a good haircut and follows all the rules.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.835
A pirate is someone
who is a little bit sloppier, messier,

12:31.919 --> 12:34.796
but is still a very effective fighter.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.216
Eddie was definitely a pirate.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.136
All we heard about was
he had combat experience.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.973
He was a good leader.
We were stoked, you know?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.892
We were pumped.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.603
We'd all heard
the mythos of Eddie Gallagher.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.398
Warpinski:
Just have a seat down at the last chair.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.661
You're E-7 SOC, is that correct?

13:05.744 --> 13:08.080
Eddie: Yeah. E-8 now, but…

13:08.872 --> 13:11.250
Warpinski: Congratulations.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.459
When did that come up?

13:12.543 --> 13:14.503
-Eddie: Last week.
-Warpinski: Oh, shit.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.296
Date of birth is--

13:16.380 --> 13:18.674
-What is it?
-Eddie: 5/29/79.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.217
Warpinski: Place of birth?

13:21.593 --> 13:24.471
Eddie: I was born in Patterson,
and then I grew up in the military.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.890
So I lived in Asia most of my life.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.146
I was a misfit growing up.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.439
My dad was in the army,

13:34.523 --> 13:37.526
so I was used to moving around
and adapting.

13:40.487 --> 13:46.076
So, yeah, I didn't feel like
I belong to this certain group of people.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.290
I was kicked out of high school
couple times for fighting.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.252
And I got my ass kicked plenty of times,
you know.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.130
I think probably more times
than I won growing up.

13:59.548 --> 14:03.218
I had to go to the hospital a couple times
from getting beat pretty bad.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.722
It ranged from, you know, a black eye

14:06.805 --> 14:10.559
to, yeah,
having my whole face just destroyed.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.188
I just always had the attitude,

14:14.730 --> 14:17.524
"You may beat me up,
but you're gonna know that you fought me."

14:17.608 --> 14:19.318
You know,
"I'll leave a mark on you somehow."

14:21.653 --> 14:25.073
And I remember after high school,
I was hanging out with my friends.

14:25.866 --> 14:30.954
And we had all taken mushrooms,
and sort of an epiphany happened.

14:32.331 --> 14:35.292
I remember just looking
around the room at these guys,

14:35.876 --> 14:38.795
but I was like, "I can't end up like this.
I gotta get outta here."

14:39.838 --> 14:42.090
You're born. You go to school.

14:42.174 --> 14:46.220
And then one day
things begin to get interesting.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.138
A Navy commercial came on,

14:48.222 --> 14:51.600
and I was like,
"Yep, that's what I wanna do."

14:54.061 --> 14:58.607
I grew up watching Rambo, Platoon,
Schwarzenegger, Stallone.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.237
In my mind,
I was like, "I wanna be a warrior."

15:04.947 --> 15:07.699
I got up and walked outta there
at 4:00 in the morning,

15:08.200 --> 15:12.454
drove to the nearest recruiting office
and waited outside until it opened.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.625
I was pretty much a recruiter's wet dream.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.920
I was like, "I wanna be a SEAL."

15:20.587 --> 15:23.131
And I was told,
from the recruiter to everybody else,

15:23.215 --> 15:25.551
you know, like,
"That's the hardest thing. Are you sure?

15:25.634 --> 15:28.053
You know,
it's almost, like, unachievable."

15:28.679 --> 15:30.556
And that just made me
wanna do it even more.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.725
I've done eight deployments.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.979
Africa, Spain, Italy,

15:37.062 --> 15:40.816
Kosovo, Liberia, UAE,

15:41.316 --> 15:43.861
obviously Iraq
and Afghanistan multiple times.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.325
The first time killing,
I don't know, I mean,

15:50.409 --> 15:54.997
I don't remember, like,
feeling anything really.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.418
I mean, I was excited, like,
"Okay, I got-- You know, I got one." But…

16:01.461 --> 16:02.671
Yeah, I had no problem with it.

16:06.008 --> 16:09.636
Applying those skills and actually
being able to take out bad guys, like--

16:09.720 --> 16:12.639
I mean, that is probably
one of the greatest feelings ever.

16:14.850 --> 16:19.021
By the time 2017 deployment came around,
I wasn't bothered by death.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.232
It didn't elicit a response.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.360
It was just, like, this is what it is.

16:29.656 --> 16:34.077
In the beginning, Eddie was a mentor
and a personal friend, you know.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.831
When he needed me to feed his dogs
because he was out of town, I did.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.709
When he needed them walked, I walked them.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.797
Once we got together as a platoon,

16:45.881 --> 16:48.509
Eddie invited me to a Bible study
at his house.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.180
What he was putting out was good stuff.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.101
I left that Bible study, like,
"Man, this is gonna be awesome."

17:10.239 --> 17:13.492
During the pre-deployment training,
we set the standard high.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.873
Showed up early, ready to train.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.545
If there was work that needed to be done,
we stayed late.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.937
Not to brag here, but it was the A-squad.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.399
You know, there's always rankings
of what platoon did best,

17:45.482 --> 17:47.943
and we were the top platoon.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.491
Everyone was keyed in.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.369
We would even train on days off.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.833
A lot of guys had been together
for three straight deployments.

18:02.916 --> 18:07.296
It was a pretty close group of dudes,
good chemistry, the history.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.965
We crushed our pre-deployment
training exercises.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.758
What is Craig doing?

18:11.842 --> 18:14.178
See? Eddie's doing it right.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.014
So we knew we'd get
the most important mission set.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.145
Having Eddie in your corner

18:23.228 --> 18:26.315
for picking where you get to go
is priceless.

18:26.398 --> 18:30.986
I mean, he gets what he wants,
and we got the number one choice.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.915
Everyone wanted Mosul, Iraq.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.209
It was the dream deployment,

18:45.292 --> 18:47.711
the place to be
if you're a special operator,

18:47.794 --> 18:51.298
the center of the universe as far as
the fight against Islamic terrorism.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.429
Mosul was the declared ISIS capital

18:57.513 --> 18:59.598
by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

19:00.849 --> 19:05.229
ISIS was being beat back,
and this was their last stand.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.855
That was the place to go.

19:07.439 --> 19:11.026
The northern city of Mosul
has been a symbol of ISIS strength,

19:11.109 --> 19:13.278
a place they've held
for more than two years now.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.158
For the people of Mosul,
it's been two years of terror.

19:18.825 --> 19:23.539
There are some 1.5 million civilians
trapped in Mosul.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.838
This is going to be
the biggest military endeavor for Iraq

19:30.921 --> 19:33.674
since the US invasion in 2003.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.885
This battle for Mosul
will determine the future of ISIS.

19:37.469 --> 19:41.348
I am talking about prime time

19:41.431 --> 19:46.728
largest MOUT urban battle
since the Battle of Fallujah

19:47.479 --> 19:52.901
against one of the most horrific enemies
ever to walk the face of this earth.

19:55.821 --> 19:57.739
They were the modern-day Nazis.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.576
They were killing little children,

20:00.659 --> 20:03.537
executing entire towns and communities.

20:04.663 --> 20:08.375
At the time, you had ISIS cells
popping up across the world

20:08.458 --> 20:11.336
with different groups
committing an allegiance to them.

20:12.713 --> 20:16.800
You don't go through BUD/S and spend
all this time away from your family

20:16.884 --> 20:18.218
to deploy to Guam, you know?

20:18.302 --> 20:20.470
You go to participate in the big show

20:20.554 --> 20:24.099
and experience combat
and have a lasting effect.

20:24.183 --> 20:27.895
American soldiers moved in here
just about three days ago

20:27.978 --> 20:31.273
to help the Iraqi partners
as they advance on Mosul.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.901
Eddie's platoon was rock-solid,

20:33.984 --> 20:37.487
some really, really,
really good operators.

20:37.571 --> 20:41.241
And I was like, "We're about to kick off
the best deployment of our lives."

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
It was like, "This is gonna be sweet."

20:46.413 --> 20:48.540
It's everything that you've dedicated

20:48.624 --> 20:51.210
the last X amount of years
of your life to.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.128
We were going to the Super Bowl.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.183
-Dille: Right. Day 1, heading into Mosul.
-Is it on?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.851
-Yeah.
-Nice.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.853
Dille: Master Craig.

21:09.937 --> 21:14.399
We got Tom. Javi. Javi on the gun.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.985
-Javi on the gun.
-See if we can do some work.

21:24.076 --> 21:27.204
The first day that we pulled into Mosul,

21:27.955 --> 21:29.790
you know, the city was just on fire.

21:33.293 --> 21:37.047
You're driving down the street,
there's just bodies all over the place.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.343
There's just a line of civilians.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.887
And it looked like
a football game just got out.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.182
They would, like,
carry their elderly on carts.

21:48.559 --> 21:53.897
One instance, a lady came up to our camp
with, you know, a baby that was just limp.

21:53.981 --> 21:56.984
Had a shrapnel wound in its leg.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.487
And she just pulled down her face-covering

22:01.154 --> 22:03.073
and talked to the interpreter,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.951
and, like, looked at us and say,
"Hey, can you please help?"

22:07.244 --> 22:09.830
It was crazy to see them fleeing.

22:11.081 --> 22:14.126
I thought, "We're essentially
going into the hornet's nest here."

22:18.297 --> 22:19.298
Later.

22:25.429 --> 22:29.308
This was definitely a lot more intense

22:29.391 --> 22:31.768
than what I'd seen before
through my whole career.

22:31.852 --> 22:35.647
So, this one over here
is an ISIS office building.

22:36.899 --> 22:41.111
ISIS had, sort of, set up there
and barricaded that place for three years

22:41.945 --> 22:45.490
and getting ready for what was happening,
which was us trying to take it back.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.745
And ISIS newspapers?

22:50.245 --> 22:53.874
"Those who refuse Islam have blood."

22:53.957 --> 22:56.376
"There's nothing for them
except the sword."

22:57.127 --> 22:58.587
I guess that's what sells, huh?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.716
You really don't know
until you go there and see it firsthand,

23:02.799 --> 23:06.512
just what kind of pure evil
that they're capable of.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.061
This is where we're gonna live tonight.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.273
-Eddie, are you in here?
-Yeah, I'm right here, man.

23:18.774 --> 23:20.275
It wasn't easy living.

23:20.984 --> 23:25.489
There's 20 of us
stuffed into a 500-square-foot house,

23:25.989 --> 23:27.241
living on top of each other.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.290
-Good thing we hadn't moved.
-Where did that come from?

23:35.374 --> 23:38.460
We had to clean up first
because when ISIS goes through a house,

23:38.544 --> 23:42.965
they don't use the toilet,
and there's feces everywhere.

23:44.675 --> 23:47.803
Human poop, dog poop,
chicken poop, rat poop,

23:47.886 --> 23:50.180
moldy bread and food.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.265
It was disgusting.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.267
I mean,
we cleaned up the place with our hands.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.643
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.520
Why don't you-- You got it? Good.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.564
I shared a room with a lot of guys.

23:58.647 --> 24:01.441
Think there were 11 or 12 of us
in a very small space.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.318
It was tight living.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.988
It was the Sardine Can,
is what we came to call it.

24:06.780 --> 24:10.367
No running water.
We didn't have heat or AC.

24:11.243 --> 24:14.454
Got dust and flies a little bit.

24:15.998 --> 24:17.666
Got the full setup.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.751
But that was home.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.045
It was man camp. It was great.

24:23.422 --> 24:25.132
-What's up, V?
-What's up, D?

24:25.632 --> 24:27.885
-Making a little Cribs video.
-Villanueva: Cribs?

24:27.968 --> 24:30.179
-Yeah.
-Yo, man, let me show you. Come over here.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.266
Here we got Dragon. We got Corey.
He's sleeping.

24:34.850 --> 24:35.934
Over here in the backyard,

24:36.852 --> 24:38.437
we got our M-ATVs lined up right here.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.564
That's Shu over there.
That's my boy Stoney-T.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.649
Yo, Stoney! Stones!

24:43.650 --> 24:44.693
Say, "Hi."

24:44.776 --> 24:47.779
Yeah, that's my boy right there.
Main boy over there, killing it.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.990
-Up here is the roof. This way.
-Oh, yeah.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.617
The roof's kinda my spot too.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.160
Get up there. That's your show.

24:53.243 --> 24:55.746
The platoon is almost a second family.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.248
I mean,
you're gone the majority of the year.

24:58.332 --> 24:59.666
As tight as they come.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.085
You're seeing them
more than you see your own wife.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.713
You get to know each other extremely well.

25:05.464 --> 25:09.176
I mean, you know what
you want other guys not to eat.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.344
If they're eating something,

25:10.427 --> 25:12.804
you're gonna tell them to get out
of the room because they're gonna stink.

25:12.888 --> 25:13.889
You know who snores.

25:17.643 --> 25:19.978
There are guys
from all different walks of life.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.648
And you're living in a barracks
together or whatever,

25:22.731 --> 25:25.943
being with each other all the time.
So you see different personalities.

25:30.656 --> 25:32.991
You have people from-- who are dirt poor

25:33.075 --> 25:36.578
to people who maybe were raised
with a silver spoon in their mouth

25:36.662 --> 25:38.205
but still wanted to serve their country.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.875
And everybody sorta comes together
and gets thrown in the same pot.

25:41.959 --> 25:42.960
Perfect.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.712
We gotta put this up
so we can start dropping bombs.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.134
That didn't go well.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.262
No pressure.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.268
Was that my fault?

26:06.859 --> 26:08.777
Watching it go down right there.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.490
Dylan Dille, he is an absolute wizard

26:13.574 --> 26:15.826
when you're talking about ballistics
and rifles.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.995
Dille:
I think I'm just gonna lay down there.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.163
That little murder hole.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.249
It goes back to his hunting background,

26:22.332 --> 26:24.501
where he grew up in Colorado
hunting big game.

26:24.585 --> 26:27.671
Dylan is a sniper,
and he was always in the top shot.

26:31.049 --> 26:34.887
He has a couple nicknames.
De-de was one of them.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.014
-Okay.
-De-de.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.807
He hates that nickname.

26:39.308 --> 26:41.059
Vriens: Oh, Craig.

26:41.143 --> 26:42.519
We made it to the SC.

26:43.937 --> 26:47.858
Craig Miller comes from
a strong law enforcement background.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.860
His dad was in the SEAL teams.

26:49.943 --> 26:54.406
Miller: When he says "fire," you're gonna
let go and drop your hand down.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.116
We called him the Sheriff.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.119
Craig holds himself and others
to a high standard.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.829
I think we're looking pretty good.

27:00.913 --> 27:02.372
And he kept people in line.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.668
Some things
you gotta earn around here, right?

27:06.752 --> 27:08.086
This right here is one of them.

27:09.171 --> 27:12.549
Ivan was a new guy.
Everyone just called him V.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.760
-Probably feels good, actually.
-Yeah.

27:15.677 --> 27:20.015
Villanueva is just a energetic,
happy, good-natured,

27:20.098 --> 27:21.600
overall positive kinda guy.

27:22.392 --> 27:26.647
Definitely experienced some adversity
in his childhood.

27:27.231 --> 27:30.400
He grew a lot
during that workup and deployment.

27:30.901 --> 27:32.945
Tell me what's going on right here.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.029
Tell me what's going on.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.990
Scott:
We've got a big old winged drone ant

27:37.533 --> 27:41.787
getting ripped to shreds
by four other smaller ants.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.122
Corey Scott's a medic.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.499
He became a good friend.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.585
We called him the Ghost

27:48.669 --> 27:50.587
because he was usually
the last guy to show up

27:50.671 --> 27:51.880
and the first guy to leave.

27:52.381 --> 27:54.383
He was there, but he wasn't, you know?

27:55.050 --> 27:59.346
Corey is a pretty private guy,
and he's not a big talker.

27:59.972 --> 28:02.766
Oftentimes he was kinda distracted,

28:02.850 --> 28:05.185
I think,
with, like, outside business stuff.

28:05.811 --> 28:08.814
But he was a decent medic
and a solid operator.

28:10.315 --> 28:13.110
That was the grid
that we put in fucking ATAK.

28:13.193 --> 28:14.778
Are you…

28:14.862 --> 28:16.613
Gio comes from the Marines.

28:17.656 --> 28:19.283
He was assigned to us.

28:20.367 --> 28:24.204
He showed up thinking that he knew
how to do stuff better than us.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.874
Gio: How long have we been trying
to shoot on these things?

28:27.416 --> 28:30.669
Gio is a little bit of a character.
He wouldn't shut up.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.546
He'd just talk about how cool he is

28:32.629 --> 28:35.090
and insert himself in conversations
he shouldn't be in.

28:36.592 --> 28:40.095
I talk about Navy SEAL egos,
and I also have a massive ego.

28:40.179 --> 28:43.765
So, it's just very funny.
I think I may have butted heads with them.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.020
Giorgio would be up there with us

28:48.520 --> 28:50.939
and, like, I can be pretty composed.

28:52.191 --> 28:55.360
But there's also a line that you cross
where it's like, "All right. That's it."

28:55.444 --> 28:59.948
You know. We're gonna go at it,
or I'm gonna do something about this.

29:00.866 --> 29:03.911
Eddie went to Craig and said,
"Hey, Craig, I handled it.

29:03.994 --> 29:06.121
I whupped Gio's ass out behind the house."

29:07.748 --> 29:11.502
I took the correction,
and then I worked my way into the platoon,

29:12.085 --> 29:13.170
like an adult.

29:13.879 --> 29:16.256
There's always squabbling in a family.

29:16.340 --> 29:20.135
You're with someone 18 hours a day,
eventually, you know--

29:20.219 --> 29:22.346
you can't stand each other
for a little while.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.439
Thank Jesus.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.608
Jesus!

29:34.691 --> 29:38.278
A lot of these guys, I just didn't
have anything in common with them.

29:39.112 --> 29:42.616
They were a lot younger. I think I was,
you know, ten years older than…

29:42.699 --> 29:43.700
most of them.

29:45.327 --> 29:46.995
I really didn't hang out with any of them,

29:47.079 --> 29:50.541
except for Jake Portier,
the officer-in-charge.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.376
Hey, the intent is to not--

29:52.459 --> 29:55.379
We're not gonna wait there
with three guys going back and forth.

29:55.462 --> 29:58.048
Clean up his quarters.
Go and hit them with those…

29:58.131 --> 30:00.217
I knew him pretty good. We were buddies.

30:01.093 --> 30:06.557
I was his instructor at BUD/S,
and he was also on my previous deployment.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.685
But the rest of the guys,

30:09.768 --> 30:12.271
I had no relationship with
or didn't know them.

30:13.814 --> 30:15.315
That sort of tends to happen.

30:15.399 --> 30:16.859
You're the chief of a platoon,

30:16.942 --> 30:19.319
you get used to walking in a room
when the guys are in there,

30:19.403 --> 30:21.655
and the talking stops,
and everyone just sorta looks at you.

30:24.116 --> 30:25.409
Throughout the deployment,

30:25.492 --> 30:29.580
there was countless hours spent
for Eddie Gallagher story time.

30:29.663 --> 30:32.958
You know, stories of him
beating up superiors

30:33.041 --> 30:35.127
or all the people he's killed.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.046
Basically, all the badass stuff he's done.

30:39.965 --> 30:41.550
He always liked to brag.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.927
He said something about--
He was talking about his kill count.

30:44.011 --> 30:47.973
He's like, "Yeah, I'd been out on 80 ops,
killed an average of three people a day.

30:48.056 --> 30:49.057
You do the math."

30:50.934 --> 30:53.437
It would've made him
the number one sniper of all time

30:53.520 --> 30:54.897
if that number was true.

30:55.397 --> 30:57.232
Like, it's fucking laughable.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.778
I mean, maybe we're a tough crowd,
but it's pretty hard to, like,

31:01.862 --> 31:05.949
impress us with a story
about how many people you've killed.

31:06.575 --> 31:08.535
I was kinda like, "Man, that's weird."

31:09.203 --> 31:11.955
But being a bullshitter
doesn't mean that you're a bad chief.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.999
It doesn't mean
that you are a bad operator.

31:20.297 --> 31:21.715
I was on my third deployment,

31:21.798 --> 31:24.927
and so I got
some better living arrangements.

31:25.594 --> 31:30.349
I got to have my own room to share
with Craig, Dalton, and Joe.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.728
We lived in a little girl's room.

31:36.980 --> 31:41.443
She had her pictures up on the wall
and dresses in her closet.

31:42.528 --> 31:45.113
You could tell what happened
was that ISIS was coming,

31:45.197 --> 31:48.325
and the family essentially grabbed
whatever would fit in a suitcase

31:48.408 --> 31:49.493
and just left.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.621
I remember looking at her clothes

31:52.704 --> 31:55.415
thinking she probably didn't have much
to begin with.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.168
You know, it was just--

31:58.252 --> 32:02.631
It was a really somber thing
to think that a child that's that small

32:02.714 --> 32:07.970
is navigating the same landscape of war
at such a young age.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.139
It just humanized the whole thing.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.645
You really could see
that these people were innocent,

32:16.728 --> 32:20.607
and that they were incredibly oppressed
and under siege.

32:22.067 --> 32:24.695
I realized that what makes it worth it

32:24.778 --> 32:28.073
is that there's a million people
in the grip of ISIS,

32:28.156 --> 32:30.742
and we could go liberate them.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.875
The American forces
that have been deployed to Iraq,

32:38.584 --> 32:42.462
their mission is to advise
and assist our partners on the ground.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.965
This will be an Iraqi-led offensive,

32:45.048 --> 32:48.343
with Iraqi troops,
with American troops in a supporting role.

32:48.427 --> 32:53.056
The Pentagon refuses to say
if US troops will enter the city.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.434
The American public at that time--

32:55.517 --> 32:57.895
We've been at war for how long in Iraq?

32:57.978 --> 33:00.647
They just wanna see Iraqis
handling their own problems.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.858
And we're just there to advise and assist.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.445
He says our army,
they are taking this way.

33:06.528 --> 33:09.823
They can't reach this point,
this position.

33:09.907 --> 33:13.160
So he says we need your support.

33:14.328 --> 33:18.165
The mission was called AAA.
Advise, Assist and Accompany.

33:19.082 --> 33:21.460
We got paired up
with the Iraqi partner force.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.504
Yeah. It's fucking horseshit.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.380
Like, what's going on here?

33:25.464 --> 33:27.132
Like, what's the deal?

33:27.216 --> 33:29.635
The first couple weeks
were pretty frustrating.

33:30.135 --> 33:31.803
The rules were implemented on us

33:31.887 --> 33:34.389
that we were not allowed
to the front lines.

33:34.473 --> 33:36.934
We had to stay at least 800 meters back.

33:37.851 --> 33:39.645
And this is coming from leadership.

33:42.314 --> 33:45.651
But then ISIS would just
fly drones over ahead,

33:46.276 --> 33:48.570
get our location
and just start dropping mortars on us.

33:48.654 --> 33:49.738
Craig.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.073
-Yeah?
-What's up?

33:52.074 --> 33:53.742
-Is that ours?
-It's not.

33:53.825 --> 33:55.577
Enemy drone flying over our position.

33:56.078 --> 33:57.079
Yeah, yeah. I th--

33:57.788 --> 33:59.039
I'm almost certain it was that.

34:03.252 --> 34:07.714
And we would either sit there
and suck up mortars all day or go home.

34:09.257 --> 34:10.967
Fucking stupid.

34:12.010 --> 34:16.348
When you start a deployment,
you have this exuberance.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.559
We're gonna fly around in helicopters
in the middle of the night

34:18.641 --> 34:19.685
and shoot dudes in the face.

34:20.853 --> 34:25.607
But with AAA, Advise, Assist, Accompany,
you're sitting--

34:25.690 --> 34:30.404
you're just idling in trucks and you're
tossing, you know, a little UAV, and…

34:31.780 --> 34:35.576
you're not there doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

34:37.578 --> 34:40.330
Dille: Decided today would be a good day
to go to the carnival.

34:40.414 --> 34:41.956
Miss the crowds.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.042
Go on a Monday.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.127
No.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.879
Wednesday.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.799
There were long stretches of boredom,
you know?

34:50.882 --> 34:52.676
Everyone just wanted to do their job.

34:52.759 --> 34:55.929
You put a junkyard dog
into a slaughterhouse

34:56.013 --> 34:58.348
with a bunch of meat hanging,
they're gonna wanna chew.

34:58.432 --> 34:59.516
That's what we wanted to do.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.978
This was supposed to be, like,
the rock star deployment.

35:03.061 --> 35:05.063
And I'm just like, no.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.900
Get your shit.
We're leaving in eight minutes.

35:08.734 --> 35:12.779
The Iraqis, they were like,
"Why aren't you guys coming up with us?"

35:12.863 --> 35:16.116
They would be like, "Well,
you guys are being a bunch of pussies."

35:16.200 --> 35:18.452
And they were losing guys every day.

35:49.024 --> 35:52.069
If they started taking fire,
they would just be at a standstill.

35:55.072 --> 35:58.867
The entire city was booby-trapped
with VBIEDs,

35:59.409 --> 36:01.453
Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device.

36:03.247 --> 36:07.042
ISIS was packing these things,
thousands of pounds of explosives.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.877
And when one of these guys went off,

36:08.961 --> 36:11.964
you felt it in your chest,
even if you were blocks away.

36:18.136 --> 36:21.348
We would literally watch,
like, dozens of Iraqis die,

36:21.431 --> 36:22.558
like, every day.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.725
Just like, poof.

36:24.226 --> 36:28.647
Like, oh, it was like, "There's no longer
any people in this huge square--

36:28.730 --> 36:30.774
100-, 200-square-meter area."

36:30.858 --> 36:32.317
It's, like, gone.

36:36.071 --> 36:38.991
If you didn't hear at least
ten of those a day, it was a slow day.

36:39.074 --> 36:41.159
And these things would
tear down buildings.

36:41.243 --> 36:43.370
These would turn people into pink mist.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.169
It was clear that a hands-off approach
wasn't gonna work.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.972
What was told to us is like,
"This is not your fight.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.183
This is not worth dying for."

37:04.933 --> 37:07.519
Which is-- I didn't believe in
that mindset whatsoever.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.316
Where's that sniper ID thing?

37:12.399 --> 37:14.026
The nature of most team guys,

37:14.610 --> 37:16.236
we wanna be a part of the fight.

37:16.737 --> 37:20.073
So it was natural, at least from a chief
that's more aggressive, such as Eddie--

37:20.741 --> 37:22.993
"All right.
We're gonna bend this rule a little bit

37:23.076 --> 37:25.829
so we can get closer
and better affect the battle-space."

37:26.830 --> 37:28.916
It looks like we might have to…

37:29.708 --> 37:34.129
So, that's when myself and my OIC,
Jake Portier,

37:34.213 --> 37:37.466
came up with a plan to--
to actually become more offensive.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.468
Eddie:
All right. Hey, we got everybody here?

37:39.551 --> 37:40.552
-Yep.
-Yeah?

37:41.428 --> 37:43.138
We weren't, like, breaking rules.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.641
We were--
I would call it more pushing the envelope.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.978
One of the things
that was said very early on

37:50.062 --> 37:52.064
was that we're gonna follow the rules

37:52.147 --> 37:54.191
until we can figure out
how to work around 'em.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.068
They are shooting at us.

37:56.151 --> 37:58.987
On one of our morning roundups,

37:59.071 --> 38:03.033
Eddie said, "Look, we're gonna stir up
the hornet's nest."

38:04.409 --> 38:06.578
He intended to go to a place
that was not allowed.

38:08.580 --> 38:12.292
Eddie: All right,
we're gonna bump down the road some.

38:12.876 --> 38:16.129
Guys were like,
"Oh, yeah. Okay. Cool. Check."

38:18.340 --> 38:19.883
We were like, "Fuck yeah."

38:19.967 --> 38:22.719
We were in support of moving up
beyond the line of advance.

38:22.803 --> 38:24.805
Like, I don't give a fuck.

38:24.888 --> 38:27.432
We're here for a war.
We know that there's danger.

38:27.516 --> 38:29.810
That's what we had to do
to be a part of the fight.

38:31.770 --> 38:32.938
-Are we all going?
-Not yet.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.065
Hey, you can come with us.

38:35.148 --> 38:37.109
-Yeah.
-All right. Ready?

38:37.192 --> 38:38.402
-All right.
-Yep. Go.

39:22.196 --> 39:25.157
As soon as we started implementing
these new tactics,

39:25.240 --> 39:27.451
we started seeing huge results.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.704
We were able to draw ISIS
out into the open a lot more

39:30.787 --> 39:31.914
by picking fights with them.

39:31.997 --> 39:33.832
They're coming. They're coming.

39:37.711 --> 39:40.130
Go, go, go, go!

39:45.385 --> 39:49.431
The partner force was
really feeding off of that,

39:49.515 --> 39:50.849
and, like, starting to clear.

40:01.902 --> 40:04.613
Because I think they felt more comfortable
that we were up there,

40:04.696 --> 40:07.199
sticking our necks out a little bit
for them.

40:08.909 --> 40:09.952
Eddie: Fuck yeah.

40:15.457 --> 40:16.917
-Hey, Gio.
-Yeah?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.836
Did they shoot a rocket at us,
or did they shoot mortars?

40:18.919 --> 40:20.712
-Gio: That was a mortar.
-That was a mortar.

40:21.213 --> 40:25.509
The function that I perform
is proximity-based.

40:28.053 --> 40:30.848
Where I fit in is
I provide signals intelligence.

40:31.473 --> 40:34.518
Gio: That should be our street
if you keep on flying that way.

40:34.601 --> 40:38.230
When Eddie's doing
this ISIS draw-out mission,

40:38.313 --> 40:40.232
he's exposing guys to me.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.901
And I'm getting the information
that I need

40:42.985 --> 40:44.403
to drop bombs on their head.

40:45.863 --> 40:48.448
-Dude, they're all three of them.
-All three of them are fucking running.

40:48.532 --> 40:50.826
They're running to the house
on the fucking other side of the road.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.578
Should I hit the same spot?

40:52.661 --> 40:55.122
Hey, go right fucking 40 meters.

40:55.873 --> 40:59.168
-Three, two, one…
-Drop here.

41:02.087 --> 41:05.799
My job is very much so an art form
and not just a science.

41:05.883 --> 41:08.635
And Eddie was helping me
paint a fucking beautiful picture.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.814
I wanted my pound of flesh, you know?

41:21.315 --> 41:23.192
I was like, "We're gonna pound 'em.

41:23.692 --> 41:26.153
And we're gonna pound them
till we need to stop."

41:28.614 --> 41:30.949
We were going out every day,
but it was worth it

41:31.033 --> 41:33.827
because we were actually
seeing the fruits of our labor,

41:33.911 --> 41:36.705
you know happen right in front of us.

41:52.971 --> 41:56.350
Ground down to its bones,
Mosul is so quiet,

41:56.433 --> 41:58.685
spectral where once it bustled.

41:58.769 --> 42:01.188
You ask yourself, "Where are its people?

42:01.271 --> 42:03.065
Where have ISIS taken them?"

42:03.649 --> 42:04.816
The answer is here.

42:07.319 --> 42:12.282
Trapped in the warren of the Old City,
the densely populated final holdout,

42:12.366 --> 42:13.784
hell could await.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.079
The battle to liberate Mosul

42:17.162 --> 42:19.665
has reached a critical phase tonight.

42:19.748 --> 42:23.293
After months of fighting, Iraqi troops,
backed by the US,

42:23.377 --> 42:25.712
have taken all but a few neighborhoods.

42:25.796 --> 42:27.881
The fighting is so close and so intense,

42:27.965 --> 42:29.716
and the Old City is so claustrophobic,

42:29.800 --> 42:33.971
it's impossible to describe accurately
quite how difficult the fighting is there.

42:34.054 --> 42:36.807
Until now, Iraqi forces have relied on

42:36.890 --> 42:39.977
US air strikes, artillery
and heavy weapons,

42:40.060 --> 42:42.604
but that won't work
in these narrow alleyways.

42:44.064 --> 42:46.358
As we progress, it became much more dense,

42:46.441 --> 42:48.193
and the whole character of it changed.

42:48.944 --> 42:52.197
Everyone understood the level of risk
inherent to that

42:52.281 --> 42:55.158
as we progressed through
and got closer and closer to,

42:55.242 --> 42:57.244
you know, the last stronghold.

43:03.917 --> 43:07.546
Midway through deployment,
we shifted to push from a new direction.

43:07.629 --> 43:08.839
Pinch ISIS off.

43:11.091 --> 43:12.342
The pivotal moment came

43:12.426 --> 43:15.596
when we changed the angle
and we set up on ISIS's flank.

43:16.638 --> 43:20.350
So they had all their attention to
our partner force,

43:20.434 --> 43:23.145
and we were able to blast them
from the side.

43:26.023 --> 43:27.441
Once we changed the angle,

43:27.524 --> 43:30.944
we were actually able to see
down alleyways where they were moving.

43:31.570 --> 43:34.656
So we were able to just totally
turn the tide of the engagement.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.241
Rocket out.

43:42.664 --> 43:45.542
-Yeah!
-Hell yeah!

43:47.252 --> 43:49.880
Dille: Watch out. I want to get
in the scope. See if I can see anything.

43:49.963 --> 43:52.549
Well, if anyone was in that building,
they gone.

43:53.050 --> 43:55.469
We went across the river
to these two towers.

43:57.054 --> 44:01.183
And turns out this position
was overlooking ISIS's rest spot

44:01.266 --> 44:04.061
where they would go up to get water
and hang out,

44:04.144 --> 44:05.854
'cause you had the Tigris River
right there.

44:08.690 --> 44:11.235
Dille:
Those are the loopholes right there?

44:12.444 --> 44:13.445
All right.

44:14.321 --> 44:15.322
Ready?

44:19.117 --> 44:23.747
So, being a sniper in an urban playground
like that was a target-rich environment.

44:24.790 --> 44:28.168
-Up there's pretty good for you.
-Dille: That's where I'm gonna set up.

44:29.545 --> 44:31.463
Now you could see everything

44:31.547 --> 44:35.676
from guys running back and forth
with guns and in body armor,

44:36.385 --> 44:39.680
to, like, a family playing--

44:39.763 --> 44:42.391
like, splashing in the river,
very close to each other.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.768
There's a lot of city out there
we can see.

44:44.852 --> 44:46.144
Yeah.

44:46.228 --> 44:47.646
Dylan came back, and he's like,

44:47.729 --> 44:50.649
"Dude, it was a turkey shoot.
It was awesome."

44:52.568 --> 44:53.819
Oh, hell yeah.

44:54.653 --> 44:55.988
It was a huge swing.

44:57.197 --> 44:59.533
That was the first time
that everything worked,

44:59.616 --> 45:01.702
and it all came together.

45:07.583 --> 45:09.084
Goddamn.

45:09.918 --> 45:13.463
You got into a rhythm where it felt like,
you know, "I'm a professional now."

45:15.507 --> 45:17.593
-Fun. Fuck yeah.
-Goddamn.

45:17.676 --> 45:19.094
I was like,

45:19.178 --> 45:21.221
"This is what being a SEAL is about."

45:22.472 --> 45:23.932
Direct hit.

45:25.350 --> 45:27.311
We never let them rest.
We were relentless.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.271
Yeah, yeah! Fuck yeah! We got 'em.

45:29.354 --> 45:33.442
Our platoon killed a crap-ton of dudes.

45:36.195 --> 45:38.488
Our kill count was astounding.

45:38.572 --> 45:42.659
We were watching, almost on a daily basis,
ISIS get pushed out of that city.

45:44.828 --> 45:47.831
It was everything you could want
out of a dream deployment.

45:49.499 --> 45:53.086
That moment when you pull the trigger
and you destroy somebody that was,

45:53.170 --> 45:57.257
you know, either harming an innocent life
or out to destroy America.

45:58.008 --> 46:00.511
That's why I joined. That's my purpose.

46:03.889 --> 46:05.432
The clearance of Mosul,

46:05.516 --> 46:09.937
there was platoons in Iraq
that were just chomping at the bit

46:10.020 --> 46:13.398
to displace us and get in on the action.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.402
It was everything you could hope for.

46:17.486 --> 46:21.114
This was the sexiest thing to be doing.

46:22.908 --> 46:24.743
Baby!

46:25.619 --> 46:27.663
I enjoyed the adrenaline rush.

46:29.498 --> 46:30.582
Load me up, baby!

46:31.166 --> 46:34.670
Be almost dying one day,
to getting chills the next day.

46:36.129 --> 46:37.130
Yeah!

46:39.842 --> 46:42.386
I remember once thinking to myself, like,

46:43.136 --> 46:44.888
"I need to be very careful

46:44.972 --> 46:47.224
because I'm starting to enjoy this
too much.

46:47.307 --> 46:52.521
I'm getting to the point
where killing is so a nothing, almost."

46:54.481 --> 46:59.570
You see death on such a huge scale
that the lines become a little bit blurry.

47:00.529 --> 47:02.739
-What's up?
-Where's the dead body at?

47:02.823 --> 47:03.824
Right there.

47:04.575 --> 47:05.576
Huh.

47:06.869 --> 47:07.953
I didn't see him.

47:08.787 --> 47:10.622
Think he's an ISIS dude
or just a civilian?

47:11.707 --> 47:13.333
Who even knows anymore?

47:18.755 --> 47:20.424
How we're raised in the SEAL teams,

47:20.507 --> 47:23.969
there's a underlying culture where it's,
like, you know, you gotta get your kill.

47:24.052 --> 47:25.804
That's what success is.

47:27.264 --> 47:29.933
At the same time, you need to be able
to turn that on and off.

47:31.435 --> 47:33.979
You need to be the guy
that can go into the liquor store

47:34.479 --> 47:37.733
and beat up the guy
robbing the liquor store with a gun,

47:37.816 --> 47:40.235
subdue him, wait for police to arrive,
then come out and w--

47:40.319 --> 47:42.029
walk the little old lady
across the street.

47:43.363 --> 47:46.491
That's what's expected of us.
That's what our training prepares us for.

47:48.702 --> 47:51.496
I would rather be aggressive
than nonaggressive.

47:52.456 --> 47:54.291
Aggressiveness wins wars.

47:56.168 --> 47:58.086
You've got these guys who are saying,

47:58.170 --> 48:00.005
"This is too much"
or, "We shouldn't be doing this."

48:00.088 --> 48:02.049
And then you'll-- Then you have me,

48:03.383 --> 48:06.303
like, "Let's go do this.
Let's get the job done no matter what."

48:10.474 --> 48:13.268
Every other day or so,
we just go a little bit farther.

48:13.936 --> 48:16.063
Little by little,
we were clearing the city.

48:17.481 --> 48:20.651
Till one day it was done.
Mission accomplished.

48:23.237 --> 48:25.906
Nearly 48 hours
of celebration on Iraq's streets

48:25.989 --> 48:28.825
since we heard that Iraqi prime minister,
Haider al-Abadi,

48:28.909 --> 48:31.036
was coming here to announce
the liberation of Mosul.

48:31.119 --> 48:33.622
Saying ISIS were consigned
to the dustbin of history--

48:33.705 --> 48:36.667
Celebrating the biggest victory
inflicted on Islamic State

48:36.750 --> 48:39.336
since it rampaged through northern Iraq
three years ago.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.465
After Iraq's military
drove IS out of its stronghold, Mosul,

48:43.549 --> 48:46.009
it's taken nearly nine months
of urban warfare

48:46.093 --> 48:47.678
to dislodge the jihadists.

48:47.761 --> 48:49.555
There is nothing really to say

48:49.638 --> 48:52.724
when hell is behind you
and just dust before you.

48:54.059 --> 48:55.227
When we got there,

48:55.310 --> 48:59.731
between 10,000 to 15,000 ISIS fighters
is what my estimate is,

48:59.815 --> 49:01.358
throughout all of Mosul.

49:01.859 --> 49:05.737
And then by the time we left,
I'm sure it was down to maybe 300.

49:08.866 --> 49:11.201
Our organization
knocked it out of the park.

49:11.702 --> 49:14.788
We did the best deployment
in the history of the SEALs.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.164
It was our time to shine.

49:19.334 --> 49:22.963
Our campaign to fight ISIS in Mosul,

49:23.046 --> 49:26.592
I truly believe will be written down
as a groundwork

49:26.675 --> 49:30.179
on how to fight in an Advise, Assist,
and Accompany battle.

49:36.768 --> 49:38.729
You know,
the sun is supposed to set there.

49:39.229 --> 49:42.566
That's where that deployment story
is supposed to end.

50:10.052 --> 50:14.014
We had finished up in Iraq,
and we were ready to go home.

50:15.724 --> 50:19.228
My wife, Andrea, was just worn out.
I could tell she was, like, at her wit's--

50:19.311 --> 50:21.980
as most wives are
by the end of a deployment.

50:22.064 --> 50:23.440
Sort of, like, "Get home."

50:28.904 --> 50:32.658
Eddie got back from deployment
in September 2017.

50:33.408 --> 50:37.704
As a spouse, you are
gearing up for them to get back

50:37.788 --> 50:41.875
from anywhere from a six to seven,
eight-plus-month deployment.

50:41.959 --> 50:44.127
And reintegrating into the family is,

50:44.211 --> 50:47.840
like, a huge part of the life cycle
in the SEAL teams.

50:49.383 --> 50:52.344
Eddie and I met
when we were 16, 17 years old.

50:53.470 --> 50:57.057
We got married right before
his first deployment with SEAL Team 7.

50:58.684 --> 51:00.352
And that's really where the experience

51:00.435 --> 51:05.107
of being enmeshed in this whole
"SEAL wives and team guys" began.

51:06.942 --> 51:08.402
After he got back,

51:08.485 --> 51:11.822
Eddie had just been voted
the number one platoon chief,

51:12.406 --> 51:15.951
and he had taken that SEAL team
to the highest-ranking platoon.

51:17.035 --> 51:19.955
He cleared Mosul
in half the time they'd anticipated.

51:20.831 --> 51:25.586
It was just a huge step
in the trajectory of his career.

51:27.462 --> 51:30.674
But that's when everything
started to change.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.139
I sensed a lot of animosity
between the wives.

51:37.639 --> 51:40.225
These are people
that my daughter babysat for them,

51:40.309 --> 51:42.102
and all of a sudden, cold shoulder.

51:42.728 --> 51:44.438
And I was like, "Okay, this is weird."

51:46.273 --> 51:49.359
Josh Vriens,
he lived four houses down from me,

51:49.443 --> 51:50.986
and we'd see his wife, you know,

51:51.069 --> 51:53.363
walk around the neighborhood,
or we'd be walking and--

51:53.864 --> 51:55.616
and she gave Andrea some attitude.

51:55.699 --> 51:58.493
Andrea came back,
and she was sorta like, "What's going on?"

52:00.579 --> 52:02.372
These little rumors started to come up.

52:03.457 --> 52:07.836
Some peers of Eddie overheard
some of the guys from Eddie's platoon

52:07.920 --> 52:09.505
coming back on the flights,

52:09.588 --> 52:13.217
and they were just talking
major, major shit on Eddie.

52:14.635 --> 52:19.598
And so his peers are like,
"Dude, what's up with your platoon?

52:19.681 --> 52:22.935
Like, your platoon is,
like, pissed at you."

52:24.895 --> 52:27.564
Everybody that knew me was like,
"What is going on here?"

52:27.648 --> 52:30.442
Like, being-- "We're being told
he's some kind of psychopath."

52:31.485 --> 52:34.363
I just heard, like, "Dude, these guys
are talking a lot of shit about you,

52:34.446 --> 52:36.406
and they're saying that you are dangerous

52:36.490 --> 52:39.034
and you did some unethical stuff
on deployment."

52:40.702 --> 52:43.830
We were not aware
of how much the undercurrent

52:43.914 --> 52:46.917
would pick up and become a freaking storm.

52:48.460 --> 52:51.255
Warpinski: Eddie, your name came up in a
case that we're working.

52:51.338 --> 52:53.799
Do you have an idea what this is about?

52:53.882 --> 52:56.552
Eddie: I don't really.
I just heard rumors.

52:57.261 --> 52:59.346
Warpinski:
There were some implications with

52:59.429 --> 53:03.475
SEAL Team 7, Platoon Alpha,
during the deployment about…

53:03.559 --> 53:06.854
It was a Law of Armed Conflict
violation that's been reported,

53:06.937 --> 53:08.605
and so that's what we're looking into.

53:12.067 --> 53:18.115
These thousand-foot views of morality
are very easy in a boardroom.

53:18.198 --> 53:21.368
It's very easy to talk about
in an office space,

53:21.451 --> 53:22.661
and it's much different

53:22.744 --> 53:26.415
when you're asking a man
to become an animal for his country.

53:28.208 --> 53:30.544
Vriens: We did a lot of good stuff
on that deployment.

53:30.627 --> 53:32.129
But this is, like,

53:32.838 --> 53:34.214
horrible stuff was happening.

53:34.756 --> 53:36.675
Dille: That is not how we do business.

53:37.176 --> 53:39.720
That is… completely fucked up.

53:39.803 --> 53:40.971
Miller: I was just thinking,

53:41.054 --> 53:44.433
"This is the most disgraceful day
I've ever seen in my life."

53:45.017 --> 53:48.478
Little did I know that
that wasn't the end of combat,

53:48.979 --> 53:51.315
that the real conflict was just starting.
