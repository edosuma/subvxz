02:13.215 --> 02:15.342
How many of those things
do you go through a week?

02:15.426 --> 02:18.179
Depends whose face I see on the ball.

02:19.346 --> 02:21.098
- Wood, huh?
- Yeah.

02:21.390 --> 02:24.894
- Bjorn Borg used a racquet like this.
- I'm impressed.

02:24.977 --> 02:28.647
Then again, you're an impressive guy.
Lettered in three sports,

02:28.731 --> 02:33.444
straight-A student, debating team,
environmental awareness program,

02:33.861 --> 02:36.280
you interned
at the Governor's office last summer.

02:36.363 --> 02:39.158
Yeah. Listen, Walsh,
I told you, no interviews.

02:39.575 --> 02:43.287
You know, Borg didn't become a star
until he started talking to the press.

02:45.205 --> 02:47.541
You got to learn how to take the heat.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.378
Okay. You got it.

02:53.297 --> 02:55.174
- You're kidding.
- No.

02:55.257 --> 02:57.634
Just make sure to spell my name right.

02:57.718 --> 03:00.262
No problem. Thanks.

03:02.014 --> 03:03.891
So whose face is it?

03:04.057 --> 03:05.976
- What?
- On the ball.

03:06.518 --> 03:08.353
Who are you trying to clobber?

03:15.861 --> 03:19.489
- It's 1:00. I've got to call home.
- Would you just relax?

03:19.614 --> 03:22.784
Yeah. I heard you get 200 points
just for writing your name on the SAT.

03:22.868 --> 03:25.704
- That's only if you spell it right.
- Oh, that's funny. Really.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.914
You know, there's nothing funny
about SATs.

03:27.998 --> 03:30.167
Our whole college careers
hang in the balance.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.586
- Aren't you guys even worried?
- Yes, I'm worried.

03:32.669 --> 03:33.879
Fred Segal's having a sale.

03:33.962 --> 03:37.799
I just know by the time we get there,
everything in a size two will be gone.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.803
Of all the seniors graduating
from West Beverly this year,

03:41.887 --> 03:44.931
which one would you most like to see
in the Senior Spotlight?

03:45.473 --> 03:48.018
- Roger Azarian.
- Done.

03:48.643 --> 03:51.938
No way. You got an interview
with Roger Azarian?

03:52.230 --> 03:54.816
- Way to go, Ace.
- I thought you'd be pleased.

03:54.899 --> 03:56.776
Well, keep it tight. No fluff.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.612
I want to know
what makes a guy like that tick.

04:00.780 --> 04:03.908
- Steve, just the man I was looking for.
- Hey, Brandon. What's up?

04:03.992 --> 04:05.201
You got the scoop on everybody.

04:05.285 --> 04:07.328
You know anything
about Roger Azarian?

04:07.412 --> 04:09.706
What's to know? He'll probably get
a Rhodes Scholarship,

04:09.789 --> 04:12.041
marry Miss America,
and run for President.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.626
Sounds like a perfect specimen.

04:13.710 --> 04:17.380
Being a perfect specimen is easy
when you're George Azarian's son.

04:17.672 --> 04:20.216
How'd he make all his money, anyway?

04:20.300 --> 04:23.261
Self-made, he started at the bottom.
Now he owns half of Orange County.

04:23.344 --> 04:25.847
He's got houses
in New York, Hawaii, France.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.807
A couple of hotels on Park Place
and Boardwalk?

04:27.890 --> 04:29.767
Yeah, but this isn't Monopoly money.

04:29.851 --> 04:31.185
You know,
my mom used to date this guy

04:31.269 --> 04:32.395
when he owned the Apollo Studios.

04:32.478 --> 04:35.398
Now, if she'd had married him,
I'd had a shot at Stanford.

04:35.481 --> 04:36.983
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:37.483 --> 04:41.279
Word has it that he built a library
up there just so old Rog will get in.

04:42.488 --> 04:45.241
Wonder what it'd take
to get my dad to do that for me?

04:45.324 --> 04:47.326
About 10 million bucks.

04:49.412 --> 04:52.039
$14.38.

04:53.332 --> 04:56.502
$32.20.

04:56.586 --> 04:58.462
- Where is it?
- What?

04:58.921 --> 05:01.340
- Mom!
- Oh.

05:03.676 --> 05:06.262
I believe this is what you're looking for.

05:07.346 --> 05:10.016
- I can't.
- Brenda, would you just open it?

05:10.099 --> 05:11.892
I have to be alone.

05:14.186 --> 05:16.272
- Taxes?
- How'd you guess?

05:16.689 --> 05:20.359
- Why don't you just hire an accountant?
- I married one.

05:20.860 --> 05:23.988
You know T.S. Eliot was right.
April is the cruelest month.

05:26.407 --> 05:29.368
- I don't believe this. 1190.
- Oh, how nice!

05:29.451 --> 05:32.788
- Let me see that.
- 630 math and 560 verbal.

05:32.872 --> 05:36.041
- Girl, you're in UCLA so easy.
- Or U of Minnesota.

05:36.709 --> 05:39.962
- I have to see Brandon's.
- Oh, no way.

05:40.129 --> 05:42.214
Mom, I know he did better than me.

05:42.464 --> 05:45.175
Could we get out of here?
I really have to go.

05:45.259 --> 05:47.803
Honey, I think maybe the girls want to
get home, see their own scores.

05:47.886 --> 05:51.432
Oh, sure. Right, okay, go on, leave.
Just call me.

05:51.557 --> 05:55.436
Don't worry. You'll be the first to know.
Pacoima Junior College here I come.

06:36.893 --> 06:39.479
- Looking for something?
- Sorry. I was just...

06:39.563 --> 06:41.398
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

06:45.777 --> 06:49.364
It's a Walther PPK.
It used to belong to Dashiell Hammett.

06:49.990 --> 06:51.157
Wow.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.827
My parents wouldn't even allow toy guns
in the house.

06:53.910 --> 06:54.995
Well, that's no toy.

06:55.078 --> 06:57.497
My father taught me how to shoot it
when I was six years old.

06:57.581 --> 07:00.166
We used to go out in the backyard
for target practice.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.586
- Six? Isn't that a little young?
- Survival of the fittest, Walsh.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.255
It's kill or be killed.

07:05.588 --> 07:07.716
You talking about the jungle
or Beverly Hills?

07:07.799 --> 07:09.509
Same difference.

07:09.843 --> 07:13.805
$10,647 on non-deductible interest.

07:14.639 --> 07:18.059
To say nothing
of all these entertainment expenses.

07:18.143 --> 07:20.186
Okay, so we'll cut back.

07:20.353 --> 07:22.897
What are you so worried about?
We're doing fine.

07:22.981 --> 07:26.651
- I just hate this time of year.
- You want me to help?

07:26.734 --> 07:28.945
Okay, I'll help. I promise.

07:29.195 --> 07:30.363
You say that every year.

07:30.446 --> 07:33.533
And then you go off and you solve
the tax problems of corporate America,

07:33.616 --> 07:36.577
and I'm the one who has to handle
the shoeboxes from hell.

07:36.661 --> 07:38.830
- Is Brandon home yet?
- No, he's not, honey.

07:38.913 --> 07:40.373
Where is he?

07:40.456 --> 07:42.291
What's with her?

07:43.584 --> 07:45.628
Their SAT scores came today.

07:45.712 --> 07:48.589
She's just dying to beat
Brandon's score.

07:49.716 --> 07:52.301
- I wonder who did better.
- Oh, Jim.

07:52.552 --> 07:56.180
- Five bucks says...
- No way. I will not bet on my children.

07:57.932 --> 07:59.433
Hey, thanks for the tour, man.

07:59.517 --> 08:00.643
Hope I wasn't rude to ask,

08:00.726 --> 08:02.520
but I've never seen a place
like this before.

08:02.687 --> 08:06.148
- Big enough for two people, you think?
- Who, your mom and dad?

08:07.233 --> 08:09.402
So, what do you want to know
for this piece you're writing?

08:09.485 --> 08:12.822
- Oh. Well, I thought we'd start with...
- No tape.

08:13.364 --> 08:14.782
Excuse me?

08:14.991 --> 08:17.326
It's just, the recorder
makes me feel uncomfortable so...

08:17.994 --> 08:20.329
Well, it's just for accuracy.

08:21.205 --> 08:25.167
But if you're not cool with it,
I'll just work from my notes.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.886
- Roger.
- Dad.

08:39.597 --> 08:41.767
Dad, this is Brandon Walsh,
from the school paper.

08:41.851 --> 08:43.686
I'm going to be featured
in the Senior Spotlight.

08:43.769 --> 08:46.480
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Brandon, huh?

08:46.564 --> 08:49.650
Always good to see the Azarian name
in print.

08:51.318 --> 08:54.613
Roger, I had lunch today at the club
with Pete Garrison.

08:54.697 --> 08:57.366
He's an old fraternity brother.
Stanford Admissions.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.911
- Dad, I told you not to.
- Don't worry, it's under control.

09:00.994 --> 09:02.496
Oh, I mentioned your screenplay to Sol,

09:02.579 --> 09:05.749
and he said he'd be glad to have
somebody at the agency give it a read.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.835
If I can't call in some favors
for my own son,

09:07.918 --> 09:09.461
who can I do it for, right?

09:09.586 --> 09:12.047
Dad, can we talk about this later?

09:12.297 --> 09:15.926
Don't worry, it's entirely off the record.
Right, Brandon?

09:16.134 --> 09:17.469
Yes, sir.

09:17.553 --> 09:19.555
Have a good interview.

09:21.598 --> 09:24.059
You actually wrote a screenplay?

09:24.476 --> 09:28.021
Every busboy in Hollywood
has a screenplay under his arm.

09:28.146 --> 09:30.732
- Can I read it?
- No one's read it.

09:30.899 --> 09:33.485
What about your father?
He said he was gonna get you an agent.

09:33.568 --> 09:35.362
He doesn't have to read it
to get me an agent.

09:35.445 --> 09:39.199
- He just has to pull strings.
- But you don't want him to.

09:39.699 --> 09:42.035
Hey, this is supposed to be
a story about me, right?

09:42.119 --> 09:44.830
- Not my dad.
- Sorry.

09:47.165 --> 09:49.084
So, you really want to see it?

09:50.377 --> 09:54.881
- Sure. I mean, I'm no critic or anything.
- No, just tell me what you think.

10:04.349 --> 10:08.228
- Great. You're home.
- So I'm home.

10:08.311 --> 10:11.147
Well, your sister's been rather anxious
for you to open this.

10:12.524 --> 10:16.319
SAT scores. I almost forgot.

10:27.997 --> 10:31.709
You're not gonna tell us?
He has to tell us, doesn't he?

10:32.085 --> 10:34.420
Well, it's between Brandon
and the college of his choice.

10:34.504 --> 10:36.673
- No way.
- Okay. Okay.

10:39.384 --> 10:41.761
1190. Beat that.

10:43.262 --> 10:45.223
You're kidding, right?

10:47.934 --> 10:49.560
What's so funny?

10:49.977 --> 10:53.022
I got 630 math, 560 verbal.

10:54.524 --> 10:57.110
560 math, 630 verbal.

10:58.194 --> 11:00.863
- Twins. True to form.
- It's gross.

11:00.947 --> 11:02.198
It's wonderful.

11:02.615 --> 11:04.367
I didn't know
Roger Azarian wrote a screenplay.

11:04.450 --> 11:05.618
Brenda, put that down.

11:05.701 --> 11:09.997
- Is that any relation to George Azarian?
- Yeah, I'm doing a profile on his son.

11:10.081 --> 11:11.832
You got to hand it to a guy like that.

11:11.916 --> 11:14.293
First generation. Son of an immigrant.

11:14.377 --> 11:16.379
Now he's one of the richest guys
in the country.

11:16.462 --> 11:18.881
Hey, Brenda, come on,
he gave this to me.

11:18.965 --> 11:20.967
I don't think
he wants anyone else to read it.

11:21.050 --> 11:24.845
Brandon, don't be ridiculous.
Screenplays are meant to be read.

11:25.096 --> 11:27.014
Out loud, preferably.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.228
Okay, let's see.

11:33.646 --> 11:36.690
I will be Janine, and you can be Robert.

11:38.317 --> 11:41.779
"Fade in on exterior
Beverly Hills Mansion. Day.

11:42.321 --> 11:44.448
"A major Tudor, north of Sunset.

11:44.865 --> 11:46.909
"Sprawling grounds, pool.

11:47.284 --> 11:51.288
"Robert hops out of his Porsche."
Doesn't Roger have a Porsche?

11:53.332 --> 11:55.918
"Janine, a gorgeous
Twin Peaksy blonde,

11:56.001 --> 11:59.004
"kisses him with all the pent-up passion
of her 16 years."

11:59.088 --> 12:00.798
Give me a break.

12:00.964 --> 12:03.467
"Cut to the swimming pool. Day.

12:04.551 --> 12:07.262
<i>"Robert and Janine are drying off
after a swim,</i>

12:07.930 --> 12:11.850
<i>"her bikini revealing just enough
to command Robert's full attention."</i>

12:15.270 --> 12:17.689
<i>"Let's go back to the house.
I'm freezing."</i>

12:17.773 --> 12:19.775
<i>"Not the house. He's still there."</i>

12:20.025 --> 12:22.361
<i>"Come on. He's not so bad."</i>

12:22.861 --> 12:25.030
You wouldn't say that
if he was your father.

12:25.113 --> 12:28.617
Well, what can you do?
You can't pick your relatives.

12:29.034 --> 12:30.744
I could kill him.

12:32.913 --> 12:35.874
- Come on, you don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

12:37.376 --> 12:41.421
- It scares me when you talk like that.
- Yeah. But does it turn you on?

12:43.590 --> 12:45.342
Come on. In here.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.429
No phone. No father.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.515
No interruptions.

12:55.227 --> 12:58.021
<i>- Hello?
- You're not gonna believe this.</i>

12:58.730 --> 13:02.776
- What? Tell me.
- 540 verbal, 510 math. 1050.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.694
Kelly, that is fantastic.

13:04.778 --> 13:06.738
Yeah. I guess
I made some pretty good guesses.

13:06.821 --> 13:08.239
Have you talked to Donna?

13:08.323 --> 13:10.742
<i>Yeah, she said
her scores haven't come in yet.</i>

13:10.825 --> 13:13.703
- Well, that's strange.
- Yeah, she sounded kind of weird.

13:13.912 --> 13:16.039
<i>- Bran, wait for me.
- What?</i>

13:16.790 --> 13:19.918
Not you. Brandon's reading this
screenplay that Roger Azarian wrote.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.045
Oh, God, don't tell her.

13:22.295 --> 13:25.632
Roger wrote a screenplay? Really?

13:26.257 --> 13:27.509
<i>You know him?</i>

13:27.634 --> 13:30.762
Babe, not only do I know him,
but I know him.

13:31.596 --> 13:32.931
- You didn't.
- Yeah.

13:33.014 --> 13:34.807
Then the jerk dumped me
because his father said

13:34.891 --> 13:36.309
I wasn't good enough for him.

13:36.392 --> 13:38.853
Brenda, hang up.
This is getting really weird.

13:38.937 --> 13:40.855
Look, I got to go. Bye.

13:41.064 --> 13:42.690
Listen to this.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.360
"Robert takes the Walther in his palm.

13:45.443 --> 13:49.155
"Fingering the gun almost seductively,
he locks Janine in his gaze.

13:49.864 --> 13:53.743
"This is how I'm gonna do it.
This is how I'm gonna kill my father."

14:10.301 --> 14:12.887
Brandon, you landed an interview
with a guy

14:12.970 --> 14:15.598
who's destined to be one of
the hottest athletes of the '90s,

14:15.681 --> 14:17.683
not to mention one of the richest.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.518
Any sportswriter would kill
to do this story.

14:19.602 --> 14:21.896
I'm not gonna bury it
just because you don't like him.

14:21.979 --> 14:23.689
But I do like him.

14:23.773 --> 14:26.484
He just may not be the golden boy
that everybody thinks he is.

14:26.567 --> 14:29.111
Maybe that's your story. Write it.

14:29.737 --> 14:32.031
When I read it, I'll decide.

14:37.286 --> 14:41.665
Andrea, at Rap Line,
when kids call in with problems,

14:42.374 --> 14:45.044
what do you do?
I mean, what do you say?

14:45.127 --> 14:46.504
Well, if the problem is writer's block,

14:46.587 --> 14:49.673
I say, "Take two aspirin
and call me in the morning."

14:49.757 --> 14:52.051
Thanks, you're a lot of help.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.597
What we do is listen.

14:58.432 --> 14:59.850
That's it?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.728
And try to get across that he or she

15:02.895 --> 15:05.898
isn't the only one
who's ever felt that way.

15:06.315 --> 15:07.608
Thanks.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.241
Anyone I know?

15:17.826 --> 15:20.412
I'm not revealing any sources here.

15:22.748 --> 15:24.333
Roger Azarian?

15:26.001 --> 15:27.586
- Forget it, Andrea.
- Wait a minute.

15:27.669 --> 15:30.297
What kind of trouble is he in? Drugs?

15:34.593 --> 15:37.721
What would you say,
professionally speaking,

15:39.181 --> 15:43.685
if I told you a kid wrote a screenplay
that was very autobiographical,

15:44.561 --> 15:48.023
and on page 37 he says
he wants to kill his father?

15:48.482 --> 15:50.609
I'd say maybe
he should wait until the end of Act 2.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.569
I'm serious, Andrea.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.822
- I think he means it.
- Come on, Brandon.

15:55.906 --> 15:58.283
We all have the urge to kill our parents
once in a while.

15:58.366 --> 16:00.285
Doesn't mean we do it.

16:02.746 --> 16:03.997
Yeah.

16:05.248 --> 16:06.499
Right.

16:08.877 --> 16:11.796
Oh, listen to this one.
Washington and Lee University.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.424
The male/female ratio is 20 to 1.

16:14.925 --> 16:17.802
Sounds like a perfect place
to major in pre-wed.

16:17.886 --> 16:20.263
- What about you, Don?
- What?

16:20.847 --> 16:23.350
- College.
- I don't know.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.060
I mean, we have a long time

16:25.143 --> 16:27.187
before we have to start worrying
about college.

16:27.270 --> 16:28.980
So why start now?

16:32.901 --> 16:36.654
- Did she get her scores yet?
- If she did, she's not talking.

16:37.572 --> 16:42.160
Remember, people,
I want quality, not quantity.

16:43.077 --> 16:45.997
Don't let her fool you. Fill those pages.

16:46.623 --> 16:49.417
- Problem, Kelly?
- No.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.588
Okay. Get started.

17:38.049 --> 17:39.800
- Oh, Mrs Theodore?
- What is it, Donna?

17:39.884 --> 17:42.094
I don't know. My contact.
Something's wrong.

17:42.178 --> 17:45.431
- I got to go to the nurse.
- Sure, go. Be careful.

17:54.648 --> 17:55.733
So, what do you think?

17:55.816 --> 17:57.985
Should I chuck college
and try my fame and fortune

17:58.068 --> 18:00.696
- at being a screenwriter?
- Hey, man. Sit down.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.198
So did you get to
any of the hot sex scenes?

18:03.282 --> 18:06.076
A couple.
I'm only a third of the way through it.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.745
You've got a pretty wild imagination.

18:07.828 --> 18:10.664
Well, truth is stranger
than fiction, Brandon.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.336
- You mean this is true?
- What do you mean?

18:17.504 --> 18:21.592
Nothing. Nothing, it's just...
It's very riveting.

18:23.343 --> 18:26.388
Well, thanks. Thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.600
Listen, I've got season tickets
to the Dodgers.

18:31.268 --> 18:33.228
Box seats? Is this an invitation?

18:33.312 --> 18:36.773
Well, I'm not gonna be around.
So I thought maybe you'd like 'em.

18:37.691 --> 18:41.069
Why me? You trying to buy me off?

18:41.570 --> 18:44.281
Listen, if you don't want 'em,
there's plenty of people who would.

18:44.364 --> 18:46.783
No. No, hey. I didn't mean it that way.

18:46.867 --> 18:48.952
These are great. Thanks.

18:49.202 --> 18:52.205
Maybe if you can change your plans,
we could go together.

18:53.540 --> 18:55.792
So, do you want them or not?

18:57.252 --> 18:59.129
Sure, thanks.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.389
- Yo, Dylan. Dylan.
- Hey, what's up?

19:10.432 --> 19:13.727
- You and your old man.
- My favorite subject.

19:15.145 --> 19:19.232
- You two don't always...
- Fully appreciate each other.

19:19.482 --> 19:20.692
Yeah.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.153
And, with all his money,

19:23.236 --> 19:25.530
and how complicated that's made things
for you...

19:25.989 --> 19:28.658
Brandon, what do you want to ask me?

19:30.785 --> 19:33.621
When things got really bad
between the two of you,

19:34.039 --> 19:37.459
did you ever want to hurt him?

19:38.793 --> 19:41.671
- Why?
- Because, assuming you did,

19:42.297 --> 19:45.425
I need to know what kept you
from going over the edge.

19:45.758 --> 19:48.178
- Really want to know?
- Yeah.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.433
You and your sister,
you keep me from going over the edge.

19:58.187 --> 20:00.064
God, I hate essay questions.

20:00.148 --> 20:03.443
Oh, I like them, 'cause there's really
no right answer, you know.

20:04.944 --> 20:06.946
- I don't believe this.
- What?

20:07.030 --> 20:08.573
Look at Donna.

20:09.073 --> 20:12.535
I mean, first she's ditching class and
now she's lighting up in the parking lot.

20:12.618 --> 20:15.747
- What's gotten into her?
- I don't think it's what's gotten into her.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.957
I think it's what she's getting into.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.293
- Trouble.
- Really.

20:25.965 --> 20:28.259
- What about friends?
- Friends?

20:29.468 --> 20:32.888
My father says
those are the only ones you can't trust.

20:33.097 --> 20:35.099
- Do you always listen to him?
- No.

20:37.059 --> 20:40.354
- You sound angry.
- I won't take orders from him.

20:40.521 --> 20:43.107
Although he thinks
I'd be better off if I did.

20:43.399 --> 20:44.817
What's the point?

20:46.402 --> 20:49.447
It's like I don't exist
except as a reflection of him.

20:49.530 --> 20:52.199
He treats me like one of his assets.

20:53.451 --> 20:57.037
- How do you feel about that?
- How would you feel about that?

20:57.413 --> 20:59.832
I wish he were dead. All right?
Is that what you want to hear?

20:59.915 --> 21:01.750
I wish he were dead!

22:33.883 --> 22:35.260
Is that you, Son?

23:02.203 --> 23:04.289
Oh, I thought it was you.
What is it, Son?

23:11.295 --> 23:13.589
What are you doing?

23:13.798 --> 23:16.134
I know exactly what I'm doing.

23:27.145 --> 23:28.479
Brandon?

23:29.522 --> 23:30.857
Brandon.

23:33.442 --> 23:35.278
It's awfully late, isn't it?

23:35.736 --> 23:39.574
Yeah, I guess
I just lost track of the time.

23:39.865 --> 23:43.119
You've had your nose in that thing
all night. Must be some story.

23:43.202 --> 23:44.412
Yeah.

23:46.288 --> 23:47.707
Some story.

23:56.507 --> 23:57.842
Brandon!

24:00.094 --> 24:02.096
Oh, brother, dear,

24:02.930 --> 24:05.891
why didn't you tell me
you used up all the toothpaste again?

24:05.975 --> 24:07.852
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

24:07.935 --> 24:11.355
Well, next time, try to remember, okay?
I'm not a very good mind reader.

24:11.438 --> 24:14.567
- Neither am I.
- What is that supposed to mean?

24:14.942 --> 24:16.652
No. I wasn't knocking you.

24:16.735 --> 24:19.655
I was just thinking about this script
that Roger wrote.

24:19.738 --> 24:22.324
Tell me it got even more weird
by the end.

24:22.408 --> 24:26.036
Yeah, it did.
It's really hard for me to relate to it.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.831
What? The script, or Roger?

24:29.707 --> 24:33.210
- He's just very guarded.
- It must be contagious.

24:34.044 --> 24:35.254
What do you mean?

24:35.337 --> 24:37.923
Well, it's the same deal with Donna.
She just won't open up to me.

24:38.006 --> 24:40.592
And I'm supposed to be
one of her best friends.

24:41.343 --> 24:43.262
Maybe we should set them up together.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.353
Hey, Rog.

24:51.436 --> 24:53.605
How's it feel to be heading
for the Best of the West?

24:53.689 --> 24:55.274
Chill, Steve. Let me get in first.

24:55.357 --> 24:57.859
Come on. What school would turn down
a guy with your track record,

24:57.943 --> 25:00.779
- and your father?
- What's that supposed to mean?

25:01.363 --> 25:05.242
Nothing. Nothing, sorry.

25:08.912 --> 25:11.373
I figured out the two priorities
when we apply for colleges.

25:11.456 --> 25:13.500
- It's either sun or snow.
- What?

25:13.583 --> 25:17.337
University of Hawaii for the beach,
or U of Colorado for the skiing.

25:18.713 --> 25:21.883
Girls. I got your scores. Very well done.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.094
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

25:24.261 --> 25:27.138
By the way,
have either of you seen Donna?

25:27.305 --> 25:28.598
No.

25:28.682 --> 25:31.726
Well, if you do, tell her
she missed a meeting with me today.

25:31.810 --> 25:33.687
- Okay.
- Thanks.

25:36.147 --> 25:39.192
- Donna wasn't even at school today.
- Really?

25:39.609 --> 25:41.486
Maybe she had a bad hair day.

25:42.404 --> 25:46.074
Something's going on with her.
I just wish she'd tell us.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.579
Hey, Roger.

25:52.872 --> 25:54.332
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

25:54.415 --> 25:55.750
I'm writing the story tonight.

25:55.834 --> 25:57.836
I want to go over
a couple of last minute questions.

25:57.919 --> 25:59.212
Hop in.

26:07.887 --> 26:10.348
- That's your sister over there, isn't it?
- Yeah.

26:10.848 --> 26:13.434
If our friends in Minneapolis
could see us now.

26:21.651 --> 26:24.612
Yo, Dylan, how about we see
what these clunkers are made of?

26:24.695 --> 26:26.864
No, thanks.
I already know what mine can do.

26:26.948 --> 26:28.199
Suit yourself.

26:34.247 --> 26:36.499
What is he trying to prove?

26:37.124 --> 26:41.837
- Brandon says he's got big problems.
- What that guy's got is a death wish.

26:56.852 --> 26:59.230
- Donna.
- Oh, hi.

27:00.022 --> 27:02.400
Oh, hi? Is that all that you can say?

27:02.483 --> 27:03.651
Didn't you get our messages?

27:03.734 --> 27:05.778
Kelly and I have been calling you
all day.

27:05.861 --> 27:07.738
So you tracked me down here, huh?

27:08.739 --> 27:12.117
No, actually, Dylan's upstairs
picking up a sports coat.

27:13.452 --> 27:16.121
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

27:18.624 --> 27:20.209
Donna, come on.

27:20.292 --> 27:22.169
You've been avoiding us,
you been cutting classes,

27:22.253 --> 27:23.587
you've been hanging out with people

27:23.671 --> 27:25.631
you wouldn't
even have dealt with before.

27:25.714 --> 27:27.925
Yeah, well,
maybe you should get used to it.

27:31.470 --> 27:34.181
Why? What's going on?

27:37.101 --> 27:42.022
While you guys are pledging sororities,
I'll be lucky if I can even get a job.

27:46.318 --> 27:50.030
I'm an idiot, Brenda, a total idiot.

27:52.324 --> 27:54.785
What are you talking about?

27:54.952 --> 27:58.038
What, do you want me
to spell it out for you?

27:59.498 --> 28:03.293
300 math and 320 verbal.

28:04.336 --> 28:07.964
- Oh, my God.
- Are you happy now?

28:09.341 --> 28:11.385
Donna, it's only a test.

28:11.510 --> 28:15.013
Right. Well, it's just like my mom says,

28:16.056 --> 28:18.558
I better find a rich guy to marry me,

28:18.975 --> 28:21.728
'cause I'm too stupid
to take care of myself.

28:34.741 --> 28:39.412
I love this car. You could've killed me,
but I love this car.

28:39.788 --> 28:42.582
Well, I'll leave it to you in my will.

28:42.791 --> 28:46.753
- Hey, I finished your script.
- Oh, yeah? What'd you think?

28:46.836 --> 28:49.506
- Oscar written all over it?
- It's pretty good.

28:49.589 --> 28:52.509
- Thanks.
- There's a lot of real stuff in there.

28:56.346 --> 28:58.598
The character is you, right?

29:01.601 --> 29:03.269
Get real, Walsh.

29:05.396 --> 29:07.607
We'll move 10,000 shares
on the Bourse,

29:07.690 --> 29:09.484
save the rest for the New York Open.

29:10.568 --> 29:15.531
I don't care what they think in Tokyo.
I'm not interested in trading yen.

29:16.366 --> 29:18.910
If they want to swap Deutschmarks,
that's a different story.

29:18.993 --> 29:20.370
Mail here?

29:20.912 --> 29:23.456
Fine. I'll wait for confirmation.

29:24.624 --> 29:26.667
- Walsh, right?
- Yes, sir.

29:28.211 --> 29:31.047
Stanford. It appears a little thin.

29:34.801 --> 29:37.553
What's the matter, Dad?
Afraid we didn't get in?

29:37.720 --> 29:38.888
Why don't you open it?

29:38.971 --> 29:41.933
It means a hell of a lot more to you
than it does to me.

29:42.517 --> 29:44.310
I left my books out in the car. I'm just...

29:44.393 --> 29:45.895
Yeah, give us a few minutes, will you?

29:46.062 --> 29:48.439
- Stay here.
- No, Roger, you don't need me here.

29:48.522 --> 29:50.316
I'm just gonna wait in the hall.

29:54.236 --> 29:55.446
Damn!

30:00.534 --> 30:03.329
You didn't want me to make another gift.

30:03.496 --> 30:06.332
You wanted to do it on your own merit.

30:06.749 --> 30:09.126
- Who did it hurt?
- You tell me.

30:09.293 --> 30:12.087
We tried it your way,
and you didn't cut it.

30:12.171 --> 30:13.798
Now I'm taking over.

30:13.881 --> 30:16.175
I have worked too long
and too hard at this

30:16.258 --> 30:19.178
to let you throw my love for you
back in my face.

30:19.261 --> 30:21.514
Love? This isn't about love.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.359
Listen, can you go home?

30:33.442 --> 30:35.319
I don't think
this is gonna blow over for a while.

30:35.402 --> 30:37.446
Sure. I'll just grab my books
out of your car and walk.

30:37.529 --> 30:39.031
It's not far?

30:39.239 --> 30:40.449
I'm sorry about Stanford.

30:40.532 --> 30:42.951
Oh, that's okay.
I'm sorry you had to see that.

30:43.285 --> 30:46.580
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Just go home. I'm fine.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.740
Rap Line. This is Andrea.
Can I help you?

31:21.823 --> 31:23.075
<i>Andrea?</i>

31:24.618 --> 31:27.245
Brandon, you know
you're not supposed to call me here.

31:27.329 --> 31:30.040
This isn't personal.
I don't know what to do.

31:30.123 --> 31:31.750
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

31:33.293 --> 31:35.337
Roger Azarian has a gun.

31:35.587 --> 31:37.839
You told me
he has a whole collection of them.

31:37.923 --> 31:39.382
Not in his house, Andrea.

31:39.466 --> 31:42.052
He's driving around
with a Walther in his car.

31:42.135 --> 31:44.304
Plus, he just found out
he didn't get into Stanford,

31:44.387 --> 31:46.264
<i>his Dad's freaking out,
and he's upset and...</i>

31:46.348 --> 31:49.059
- Calm down, okay?
- Nobody believes me.

31:49.851 --> 31:53.980
Not Brenda, not the police.
But I really think he's gonna do it.

31:54.773 --> 31:58.276
- He's gonna kill his father.
- You called the police?

31:58.818 --> 32:01.613
- What did they say?
- There's nothing they can do.

32:03.364 --> 32:05.950
Brandon, this is out of my league.

32:06.159 --> 32:08.369
<i>I mean, what makes you so sure
you're right?</i>

32:08.536 --> 32:09.871
I'm not.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.832
But what if I am?

32:14.167 --> 32:16.836
I don't know.
Andrea says you can't help somebody

32:16.920 --> 32:18.588
who doesn't want to be helped.

32:19.923 --> 32:22.550
I respect
what you're trying to do, Brandon,

32:22.634 --> 32:24.969
but you don't even know
if this kid needs help.

32:25.053 --> 32:26.846
You don't know him, Dad.

32:26.929 --> 32:29.724
He's one of those kids you look at,
it seems like he's got it all.

32:29.807 --> 32:31.559
I mean, I wanted everything he had.

32:31.642 --> 32:35.313
The house, the car,
the freshman fan club.

32:35.897 --> 32:39.525
But he's all messed up inside.
I don't know what to do.

32:40.401 --> 32:42.862
I guess the best thing you can do
is talk to him,

32:42.945 --> 32:45.281
tell him what you're thinking.
Maybe he'll open up.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.074
Maybe he needs a friend.

34:04.610 --> 34:05.861
Hello?

34:07.195 --> 34:08.739
Anybody home?

34:20.583 --> 34:23.754
Hello? Roger?

35:59.599 --> 36:00.766
Steve, have you seen Azarian?

36:00.850 --> 36:02.476
Excuse me. What?

36:02.560 --> 36:04.145
Roger Azarian. You seen him today?

36:04.228 --> 36:06.439
Did you check the tennis courts?

36:08.316 --> 36:10.943
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

36:11.027 --> 36:14.071
But Donna's not a loser.
You've got to help her.

36:14.155 --> 36:17.450
Brenda, I appreciate your concern,
but it's really not appropriate for me

36:17.533 --> 36:19.702
to be discussing Donna's situation
with you.

36:19.785 --> 36:21.829
Yeah, but it's not fair
that you just write her off.

36:21.912 --> 36:23.622
Who said anything
about writing her off?

36:23.706 --> 36:25.374
In fact,
I'm meeting with her this afternoon

36:25.458 --> 36:27.501
to explore options for her future.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.129
Look, I know
not everybody is college material.

36:30.212 --> 36:32.298
- Brenda.
- But I'm sure her grades

36:32.381 --> 36:35.134
and test scores don't show
how smart she really is.

36:35.217 --> 36:38.095
I agree.
That's why I'm meeting with her today.

36:40.889 --> 36:43.267
Come on, honey, give me a little credit.

36:48.814 --> 36:50.774
- Coach Markham!
- Oh, hiya, Walsh.

36:50.858 --> 36:51.900
You can quote me on this.

36:51.984 --> 36:54.403
We're going to beat
Beverly Hills High School this weekend.

36:54.486 --> 36:57.197
Well, that's great.
Listen, is Azarian playing?

36:57.281 --> 36:58.782
Not if he misses another practice.

36:58.866 --> 37:01.702
- He didn't show up today?
- Nope. Not like him, either.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.330
I've called his house all day. No answer.

37:05.414 --> 37:07.291
He's not home.
He didn't show up for school.

37:07.374 --> 37:08.792
His father's not in his office.

37:08.876 --> 37:10.294
<i>Brandon, this isn't
a Hardy Boys mystery.</i>

37:10.377 --> 37:11.461
What do you think he did?

37:11.545 --> 37:13.797
Chop his father up
and bury him in the backyard?

37:14.298 --> 37:17.551
He's playing some bizarre game
of cat and mouse.

37:17.843 --> 37:20.846
I keep thinking if I look at this
closely enough, I'll find the answer.

37:20.929 --> 37:23.348
You don't even know where he is.

37:23.515 --> 37:24.975
Oh, my God.

37:27.227 --> 37:30.522
"No phones. No father.

37:32.274 --> 37:33.984
"No interruptions."

37:35.902 --> 37:38.029
Cover for me in chemistry.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.284
Sorry.

37:42.367 --> 37:45.412
Dylan, I need your car, man. It's critical.

37:45.495 --> 37:47.330
- No sweat.
- Thanks, buddy.

37:47.873 --> 37:49.207
Be careful.

37:49.708 --> 37:53.211
Now according to your records,
it wasn't until junior high school

37:53.295 --> 37:57.674
that your grades fell off so dramatically.
Do you have any idea why?

37:59.009 --> 38:02.804
- I started noticing guys more.
- Seriously, Donna.

38:04.222 --> 38:06.766
I don't know. I just can't take tests.

38:08.518 --> 38:10.770
But in class you understand?

38:11.396 --> 38:16.276
Sure, but when I sit down
and I have to do it all so fast,

38:17.569 --> 38:20.071
my brain just overloads.

38:21.197 --> 38:22.824
And I go blank.

38:24.784 --> 38:29.414
Look, this is a waste of time.
I obviously just don't have what it takes.

38:30.331 --> 38:33.543
What you may have
is a learning disability.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.924
Great. Just what I need.

38:40.008 --> 38:42.719
No, lots of people
have learning disabilities.

38:42.802 --> 38:44.345
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

38:44.429 --> 38:47.390
You're just trying to come up
with another word for stupid.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.475
Well, it won't work.

38:54.438 --> 38:56.607
I just have to accept it.

38:58.234 --> 39:02.029
- I am stupid.
- Donna, listen to me.

39:02.488 --> 39:05.157
It's very possible
that you don't do well on tests

39:05.241 --> 39:08.703
because you have trouble
processing information visually.

39:08.953 --> 39:13.040
Or you might be one of those people
who don't do well with time limits.

39:15.459 --> 39:17.378
Yes, to both.

39:18.379 --> 39:22.133
Well, what we may have to do
is read the questions to you,

39:22.216 --> 39:26.303
and make sure you understand them.
And give you more time on your exams.

39:27.763 --> 39:30.599
- You could do that?
- There's a lot we can do.

39:30.683 --> 39:32.768
If you'll let us try.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.147
Okay.

39:39.275 --> 39:40.776
Roger!

39:54.832 --> 39:57.209
Roger, it's Brandon. Open the door!

40:10.556 --> 40:12.182
Join the party.

40:17.813 --> 40:20.607
- Want a beer?
- No, thanks.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.362
What are you doing with that thing?

40:26.280 --> 40:27.990
Target practice.

40:30.659 --> 40:33.120
Hey, come on, man. Knock it off!

40:34.579 --> 40:37.124
You think if I try real hard,
I can get 'em all?

40:38.250 --> 40:40.752
Come on, put the gun away, Roger.

40:41.002 --> 40:45.298
- I can't. I need it.
- No, you don't.

40:46.800 --> 40:50.971
Look, I know you're angry at your father,
but killing him is not the answer.

40:51.721 --> 40:54.015
I'm not gonna kill my father.

40:56.726 --> 41:00.814
- What about the script?
- It's only a movie, Brandon.

41:01.189 --> 41:03.817
What good would it be, anyway?
I'd still be a failure.

41:03.900 --> 41:07.737
Take a look around you. My whole life
has been, "Can you top this?"

41:07.821 --> 41:10.115
Well, I wanted to show my father
that I could do it,

41:10.198 --> 41:12.367
that I could be just as good as him.

41:15.495 --> 41:16.996
But I can't.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.210
And I never could.

41:31.719 --> 41:33.888
You ever looked down the barrel
of a gun?

41:37.976 --> 41:40.144
Hey, come on, Roger.

41:40.478 --> 41:43.398
Go home, man.
You don't want to see this.

41:46.234 --> 41:48.903
You're right, I don't.

41:53.491 --> 41:55.410
Let me help you, man.

41:56.369 --> 42:00.373
- Let me be your friend.
- Friends? I don't have friends.

42:01.082 --> 42:03.125
I'm your friend, Roger.

42:05.795 --> 42:07.380
Don't do this.

42:09.298 --> 42:11.008
Give me the gun.

42:14.178 --> 42:15.763
Come on.

42:19.558 --> 42:20.851
Come on.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.813
Come on.

42:46.168 --> 42:49.672
Oh, there's some fancy name for it,
but the bottom line is, I'm not a dummy.

42:49.755 --> 42:51.632
- Well, we knew that.
- Yeah.

42:51.715 --> 42:53.926
Anyone who can figure out
"60% off" in their head,

42:54.009 --> 42:56.345
- down to the penny, is no dummy.
- Yeah, well, get this.

42:56.428 --> 42:59.765
They're gonna let me take
a special oral SAT, with no time limit.

42:59.848 --> 43:01.308
- That's great.
- Yep.

43:01.392 --> 43:03.394
So, where do you think I should apply
at college?

43:03.477 --> 43:06.980
I was thinking about back east,
or I could stay here.

43:07.731 --> 43:10.442
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, I've been looking for you.

43:10.526 --> 43:12.820
Next time you take my car, put gas in it.

43:12.903 --> 43:14.738
You loaned him your car?
What, are you crazy?

43:14.822 --> 43:17.407
Sorry. Look, let me make it up to you,
all right?

43:18.450 --> 43:21.537
Dodgers... Box seats! This is today.

43:21.870 --> 43:23.789
Where'd you get these?

43:24.873 --> 43:26.458
From a friend.

43:47.437 --> 43:48.772
Brandon.

43:50.315 --> 43:53.193
You can go on in.
He'll be glad to see you.

43:54.903 --> 43:58.406
- Brandon, thank you.
- It's okay.

43:59.741 --> 44:00.784
Brandon...

44:03.328 --> 44:05.372
We're both getting help.

44:19.344 --> 44:20.512
Hey.

44:21.346 --> 44:23.640
Thanks for coming. Sit down.

44:28.895 --> 44:32.065
- How you feeling?
- Got a pretty mean hangover.

44:36.402 --> 44:39.530
So, tell me,
was life any easier in Minnesota?

44:40.240 --> 44:41.866
Maybe a little.

44:42.825 --> 44:46.621
We used to go to the lakes
on weekends, fish, go camping.

44:48.122 --> 44:49.582
It was cool.

44:56.464 --> 44:58.966
I want you to know
I'm not going to write about any of this.

44:59.050 --> 45:00.676
No. I want you to.

45:04.597 --> 45:09.685
I can't hold it inside any longer.
Maybe it'll help someone, you know?

45:11.354 --> 45:13.022
- You sure?
- Yeah.

45:14.357 --> 45:16.150
That's your story.

45:21.405 --> 45:23.783
So, how come
you're not at the stadium?

45:24.492 --> 45:26.744
I thought maybe we could watch
the game together.

45:26.827 --> 45:28.537
They don't have a TV in here.

45:28.829 --> 45:30.498
Roger,

45:31.832 --> 45:33.667
that's what friends are for.

45:35.795 --> 45:38.297
<i>The Dodgers are trying to fight
their way off of the canvas</i>

45:38.464 --> 45:40.007
<i>here in the bottom of the ninth inning.</i>

45:49.099 --> 45:52.686
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a brand new ballgame.</i>
