00:40.834 --> 00:45.300
(serene music playing)

00:57.000 --> 00:59.767
-Hi, Ma. What's that?
-Ziti.

00:59.834 --> 01:03.500
It's 9 o'clock in the morning,
and you're eating pasta?

01:03.567 --> 01:06.367
No, I'm eating a bowl
of Nabisco ziti-os.

01:07.533 --> 01:11.033
I'm eating pasta
because I need to gain weight.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.834
I'm wasting away, Dorothy.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.333
What do you mean?

01:14.400 --> 01:18.166
I got weighed this morning.
I couldn't believe what I saw,

01:18.233 --> 01:19.800
98 pounds.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.166
What's your usual weight?

01:21.233 --> 01:22.834
99.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.500
Ma, you lost 1 pound.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.867
Thank you, Rene Descartes.

01:27.934 --> 01:31.533
I'm looking for advice,
not arithmetic.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.600
Ma, you cannot get upset
over 1 pound.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.133
Maybe you can't.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.734
For 50 years, my weight
hasn't changed an ounce.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.767
Until I'm back to 99,
I'm no longer Sophia Petrillo.

01:44.834 --> 01:46.600
Morning, Dorothy.
Morning, Sophia.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.266
Who?

01:48.333 --> 01:51.033
Dorothy, do you realize
it's only two weeks

01:51.100 --> 01:53.266
till Phyllis Strickley's
beach party?

01:53.333 --> 01:56.400
Two weeks till we get
into bathing suits.

01:56.467 --> 01:58.700
I slipped into last year's bikini.

01:58.767 --> 02:03.400
I think I look good,
but give me your advice.

02:03.467 --> 02:05.166
Can I pull it off?

02:05.233 --> 02:09.000
I'd be surprised if
you could cut it off.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.300
Are you implying that
I might have gained weight?

02:12.367 --> 02:14.266
There's one way to find out.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.767
-Here's the scale.
-Oh, fine.

02:24.133 --> 02:25.367
Whoa!

02:25.433 --> 02:27.033
Sophia, were you looking?

02:27.100 --> 02:28.700
Not until you stepped off.

02:28.767 --> 02:33.367
It's not good when the first rebound
goes into the low 120s.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.300
Blanche, honey, don't worry.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.667
All you need is a little
spring tune-up.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.300
I suppose you don't?

02:41.367 --> 02:43.800
Not really.

02:43.867 --> 02:46.200
Prove it. Put your money
where your mouth is.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.834
If sweet rolls aren't there already.

02:49.333 --> 02:52.100
All right. All right.
But, now, nobody look.

02:55.834 --> 02:59.533
I always thought you had
to pass zero to hit that number.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.667
Obviously, this scale is broken.

03:04.734 --> 03:08.100
I'm not surprised
after that kind of punishment.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.934
You think you're so tiny?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.300
Get weighed.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.500
I never gain weight.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.567
Show us, Rose.

03:15.633 --> 03:18.000
Ok, but I can promise you

03:18.066 --> 03:21.400
I weigh the same
as on my wedding day.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.433
-Moo!
-Moo!

03:26.233 --> 03:29.600
We all need to lose
a few pounds.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.767
We might as well start now.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.900
It's two weeks until Phyllis' party.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.433
Oh, but how?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.000
We could try another health club.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.867
Oh, no way, Rose.

03:39.934 --> 03:43.700
You haven't forgotten what
happened that time we tried that.

03:43.767 --> 03:47.667
Remember the outfits
we ended up with?

03:48.700 --> 03:50.467
This seems like a nice club.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.033
It's for women only.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.633
What's wrong with
the coed gym we just saw?

03:55.700 --> 03:58.867
Blanche, that was nothing
but a pickup scene.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.367
People running around
in skimpy outfits

04:01.433 --> 04:02.734
collecting phone numbers.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.233
That's not true. I wasn't in
a skimpy outfit,

04:05.300 --> 04:07.066
and I got all these.

04:08.533 --> 04:12.000
Hello. I'm Yvonne.
Have you been here before?

04:12.066 --> 04:16.300
Go to women's gyms,
you get hit on by a woman.

04:16.367 --> 04:17.700
I work here.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.033
I didn't mean to imply anything.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.700
She just thought
you were a lesbian.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.867
Yvonne, we want to join a gym.

04:30.934 --> 04:33.033
Well, what kind of exercise
are you interested in?

04:33.100 --> 04:35.367
Oh, nothing radical,
just lose a few pounds.

04:35.433 --> 04:36.934
-Tone up.
-Yes, slim down.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.533
-Get into my summer wardrobe.
-Get into my winter wardrobe.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.533
Get into my bath robe.

04:42.967 --> 04:46.300
Yvonne, we are desperate women,
you've got to help us.

04:46.367 --> 04:47.800
I know just what you need.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.533
Aerobics. It's what I do.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.233
But, Yvonne, you are much
younger than... they are.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.767
I know you'll love aerobics.

04:57.834 --> 04:59.867
It stretches every muscle
in your body.

04:59.934 --> 05:03.633
Honey, I've been stretching
this body for years.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.667
Blanche, sticking your feet
out of the sunroof

05:05.734 --> 05:08.533
of Chrysler New Yorker
doesn't count.

05:13.300 --> 05:16.266
We have a beginner's class
starting in 15 minutes.

05:16.333 --> 05:19.133
With some hard work, your body
can look as good as mine.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.900
All right,
we better get you some outfits.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.967
Oh, it's ok.
We brought out sweats.

05:24.033 --> 05:24.767
Sweats?

05:24.834 --> 05:27.633
Look, ladies,
if you're serious about training

05:27.700 --> 05:29.233
you wanna get off
on the right foot.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.700
Starting with good
work-out shoes.

05:31.767 --> 05:34.934
Now, these are beautiful
and a bargain at $85.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.233
Eighty-five dollars?
That's a bit exhorbent.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.900
And expensive too.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.800
Well, we do have cheaper brands,

05:43.867 --> 05:47.900
but anyone who's serious about
training wouldn't even go near them.

05:47.967 --> 05:49.834
-Well, then, we'll take those.
-Fine.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.934
You'll also need aerobic suits,
warm-up outfits, wristbands,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.066
headbands, leg warmers--

05:54.133 --> 05:56.400
Wait a minute.
Leg warmers?

05:56.467 --> 05:58.633
Well, you need something
to keep your thighs warm.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.600
What are you using now?

05:59.667 --> 06:01.767
Friction, that's why we're here.

06:05.734 --> 06:08.700
Ladies, I'm sorry,
when you told me you were serious

06:08.767 --> 06:11.000
I took you literally.
Just forget this stuff.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.567
-Wear your sweats.
-No, no, no.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.200
-Yvonne, we want all that stuff.
-Yes, we do, we really do.

06:15.266 --> 06:16.400
Well, I don't.

06:16.467 --> 06:20.767
I'm gonna stick with
my sweat suit and my flyers.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.400
I'll see you girls
in the locker room.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.600
-Yvonne, she's not serious.
-Never has been, never will be.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.166
Ok, then, you'll need
new gym bags, water bottles,

06:29.233 --> 06:31.734
vitamin packs,
and most importantly

06:31.800 --> 06:34.767
a sports training bra
to minimize jiggle and bounce.

06:34.834 --> 06:39.033
Yvonne, I think you're missing
the whole point of having breasts.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.266
-We'll take them.
-Great.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.433
Nice outfits, girls.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.133
Shut up, Rose.
Shut up, Rose.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.467
I'm Yvonne!
This is it! Woo!

07:05.533 --> 07:06.734
-Woo!
-Woo!

07:06.800 --> 07:09.066
-Woo.
-Woo.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.867
Ok, let's warm up. Woo!

07:11.934 --> 07:13.834
-Woo!
-Woo!

07:16.100 --> 07:18.467
And stretch.

07:18.533 --> 07:21.166
Legs wider.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.600
Ooh. Ooh.
That hurts.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.333
I'm not having any trouble.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.467
Why is it that doesn't surprise me?

07:31.066 --> 07:33.200
Ok, everybody on their feet.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.000
(music plays)

07:36.066 --> 07:37.633
Whirlybirds!

07:37.700 --> 07:40.166
-Whirlybirds!
-Whirlybirds!

07:41.266 --> 07:42.700
Jackhammer!

07:42.767 --> 07:44.900
-Jackhammer!
-Jackhammer!

07:47.433 --> 07:49.200
Windshield wipers!

07:49.266 --> 07:51.767
-Windshield wipers!
-Windshield wipers!

07:56.100 --> 07:57.900
Uhh! Charley horse! Oh!

07:57.967 --> 08:00.033
Charley horse.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.233
She has a cramp,
you pea brain!

08:04.300 --> 08:05.567
Oh.

08:05.633 --> 08:09.834
(Blanche) All that money,
and we only went twice.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.467
What are you cooking now, Ma?

08:11.533 --> 08:14.000
A Petrillo family delicacy,

08:14.066 --> 08:16.734
double-fudge amaretto ricotta
cheesecake.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.533
What's in it?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.033
This cake is guaranteed to make
me gain back that pound.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.133
Ma, all this eating
you're doing is ridiculous.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.066
I'm sure you're already
back up to 99 pounds.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.367
We'll see.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.200
Wrong again, Kreskin. Still 98.

08:36.266 --> 08:40.333
I can't remember the last time
I weighed 98,

08:40.400 --> 08:41.367
probably in college.

08:41.433 --> 08:45.633
Where did you go to college,
the university of Jupiter?

08:46.967 --> 08:51.967
How are we going to make ourselves
look good for the party?

08:52.033 --> 08:55.066
How else, Rose? By dieting.

08:55.133 --> 08:58.567
It's going to take a little patience
and determination,

08:58.633 --> 09:00.767
but mostly it's going
to take willpower.

09:00.834 --> 09:06.300
We are facing some long, painful,
hunger pang-filled nights.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.367
Who wants to lick the spoon?

09:07.433 --> 09:10.200
I do.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.667
Maybe we could just change
our hairdos.

09:12.734 --> 09:14.767
We cannot do that, Dorothy.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.367
I'm still trying to recover
from the last time.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.667
Remember?
About two years ago?

09:19.734 --> 09:23.133
-That little dinky place?
-With that awful...

09:27.500 --> 09:30.100
I don't think this
was a good idea.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.467
I think you're right.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.800
I've been doing
my own hair for years.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.266
That's why it looks like something
you buy on a stick at half time.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.300
We're a little nervous.

09:43.367 --> 09:44.700
This is an important event.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.066
We want to look perfect.

09:46.133 --> 09:49.433
The man works with scissors,
not a sandblaster.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.433
Ma, this is all a mistake.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.000
We don't belong here.

09:54.066 --> 09:57.867
This is one of those shops
for little old ladies.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.433
Come on. Let's go.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.867
All right.
Who's hair do I wash next?

10:02.934 --> 10:04.734
Mine.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.834
I'm first. I'm the dirtiest.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.033
Oh, God, you are gorgeous.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.800
Yes, I know.

10:15.867 --> 10:18.166
I am Eduardo.

10:18.233 --> 10:21.467
Tonight's important.
We want to look our best.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.066
Don't worry, ladies.

10:23.133 --> 10:26.934
After Eduardo does a woman's hair,
the years melt away.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.200
She is transformed
into a breathtaking,

10:29.266 --> 10:33.333
sensuous, vivacious
Goddess of beauty.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.500
I tried to get that on the sign,
but they charge by the letter.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.467
Let's begin by telling me
what you want me to do.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.467
Here. I have a picture.

10:46.266 --> 10:48.100
Well, this is not you.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.266
You are a vixen.

10:50.333 --> 10:54.900
For you I see a saucier cut,
an Audrey Hepburn look,

10:54.967 --> 10:57.266
simple, elegant,

10:57.333 --> 11:01.500
yet something to accent
these delicate features.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.400
Can you really do all that?

11:03.467 --> 11:07.633
Well, my dear,
styling hair is like making love.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.567
To do it well,
one must have trust, respect,

11:11.633 --> 11:15.100
and a chair you can
pump up and down.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.367
I am your clay. Mold me.

11:21.967 --> 11:22.967
Not so fast.

11:23.033 --> 11:26.567
Eduardo, what are
you going to do with me?

11:26.633 --> 11:28.800
You have good bones.

11:28.867 --> 11:35.867
Yes, this is a strong, noble face,
full of wisdom and sincerity.

11:36.734 --> 11:40.767
-You could be a Greek Goddess.
-Oh, go on, Eduardo.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.700
I said go on, Eduardo.

11:48.734 --> 11:49.667
Give him a break.

11:49.734 --> 11:53.266
He barely got it out once
with a straight face.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.834
Could I be a Goddess too?

11:56.900 --> 12:02.533
No. You are an earth mother,
sweet, compassionate,

12:02.600 --> 12:06.066
but bubbling with sensuality
just below the surface.

12:06.133 --> 12:09.033
Oh, that's a relief.
I always thought it was gas.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.567
Ladies, it's time,

12:15.633 --> 12:17.367
time to walk through
the looking glass,

12:17.433 --> 12:20.700
take that last glimpse
of your former selves,

12:20.767 --> 12:25.934
time to take that giant step
into the world of Eduardo-ism.

12:27.266 --> 12:29.367
You've been drinking again,
haven't you?

12:29.867 --> 12:31.066
Right.

12:31.133 --> 12:33.100
The magic begins.

12:35.066 --> 12:37.367
I'm feeling younger
and sexier already.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.200
How do I look?

12:39.266 --> 12:41.633
Like something
that came out of the air duct

12:41.700 --> 12:44.266
of the starship enterprise.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.266
What?

12:47.333 --> 12:49.100
Ladies, it's time,

12:49.166 --> 12:54.066
time for the unveiling of another
Eduardo masterpiece.

12:54.567 --> 12:55.934
Sit back...

12:57.000 --> 12:58.734
feast your eyes...

13:00.133 --> 13:04.066
and meet the woman you
always dreamt you could be.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.367
Eduardo, you've done it again.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.400
And again.

13:27.567 --> 13:28.934
And again.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.600
I still cannot believe
you talked us into that.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.600
Please, you three looked gorgeous.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.967
We didn't even look like ourselves.

13:42.033 --> 13:44.433
What's your point?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.400
You're not helping matters.

13:46.467 --> 13:50.700
We're trying to find a way
to make ourselves look better.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.066
Ok, let me think.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.000
Too bad we're not back home.

13:55.066 --> 13:56.533
There's no place like Sicily.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.033
What do you mean?

13:58.100 --> 14:01.166
There, I'd solve this problem
with one phone call.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.300
-To whom?
-Nicodimo the ugly.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.900
Whenever you wanted
to look gorgeous,

14:05.967 --> 14:07.600
you hired him to be your date.

14:08.567 --> 14:13.567
Women paid him to stand next to them
at parties and look disgusting?

14:13.633 --> 14:16.567
Please, they paid through the nose.

14:16.633 --> 14:19.600
That's also how he usually gave them
their change.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.834
Maybe we don't need
to worry about our bodies.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.667
At the counseling center, we teach
that changing your disposition

14:27.734 --> 14:31.000
can be just as effective
in making a good impression.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.433
Rose, if you're thinking

14:32.500 --> 14:35.767
of one of those personality
enhancing exercises,

14:35.834 --> 14:38.500
you're forgetting
we tried that already.

14:38.567 --> 14:41.900
-And I'll never try that again.
-Remember? Three years ago?

14:41.967 --> 14:44.467
It seems like yesterday...

14:45.467 --> 14:46.867
Damn.

14:46.934 --> 14:49.834
-What's the matter, pussycat?
-I can't balance my checkbook.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.900
Oh, well, I'm only off
by a few pennies.

14:53.967 --> 14:58.133
Back in Sicily, a few pennies
could make the difference

14:58.200 --> 15:00.667
between owning a gun
and having to insert bullets

15:00.734 --> 15:02.333
into your victim manually.

15:04.433 --> 15:07.000
Ok, Ma, I'll try it again.

15:07.066 --> 15:08.533
(doorbell rings)

15:08.600 --> 15:11.367
But there's nothing I hate more.

15:13.266 --> 15:15.500
I spoke too soon.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.633
Hi, babe. It's me, Stan.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.400
Let me rephrase that.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.166
It's me, the new Stan.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.600
What are you talking about?

15:22.667 --> 15:27.333
Don't you notice a difference?
Can't you see the glow?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.333
It's the porch light
glaring off your head.

15:32.333 --> 15:37.033
I thought I heard a man's...
oh, it's you, Stan.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.734
I've just had
an incredible experience

15:40.800 --> 15:42.867
I wanted to share
with my dearest friends.

15:42.934 --> 15:45.567
So, what are you doing here?

15:45.633 --> 15:47.934
I just finished a seminar

15:48.000 --> 15:50.633
with an encounter group
called realizations.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.734
Realizations.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.000
Let me guess.

15:54.066 --> 15:58.166
It's a group that promises
to remove all emotional blocks,

15:58.233 --> 16:01.834
self-denial, and lifelong hang-ups
in two days.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.333
Miss know-it-all.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.500
For your information,
it takes three days.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.266
What happened to you?

16:08.333 --> 16:12.400
I've learned a lot about
what makes Stanley run.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.300
Why I'm reluctant
to make commitments,

16:14.367 --> 16:18.266
why I can't keep friends,
why my business ventures fail.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.166
I finally have an answer.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.300
Because you're a schmuck?

16:25.100 --> 16:27.967
Did you take this seminar?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I think we've heard enough.

16:30.066 --> 16:33.900
I've gone through
a life-changing experience.

16:33.967 --> 16:36.600
I feel like I'm free
to love anybody.

16:36.667 --> 16:41.800
Please, you said the same thing
after you had your vasectomy.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.300
That's ok.

16:44.367 --> 16:47.066
In realizations,
I learned that people

16:47.133 --> 16:49.433
usually hurt each other
unintentionally.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.734
Therefore,
they deserve a second chance.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.800
I hate you.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.433
Nothing can bother me now.

16:56.500 --> 17:01.166
I'm in a fellowship that accepts me,
cares for me, and loves me.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.000
They're there for me.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.700
Let me enroll you all
in that fellowship.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.233
No.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.467
-But you've got to.
-Why?

17:10.533 --> 17:15.200
Because if I don't meet my quota
for enrolling new people

17:15.266 --> 17:19.133
in this loving, accepting,
caring fellowship,

17:19.200 --> 17:20.800
they're going to kick me
out in the street

17:20.867 --> 17:23.567
and never
speak to me again.

17:23.633 --> 17:26.133
Please, at least hear me out.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.533
All right, Stanley.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.066
We'll listen
to what you have to say.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.300
Beautiful.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.266
Let's go someplace
and get comfortable,

17:34.333 --> 17:35.667
get coffee, something to eat.

17:35.734 --> 17:37.133
I'll go change.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.667
We're only going into the kitchen.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.467
I hope you have cheesecake.

17:43.533 --> 17:46.500
That's it. I've had it
with your freeloading.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.633
Get out!

17:48.700 --> 17:50.033
You have so much hostility,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.667
so much aggression,
so much mistrust.

17:52.734 --> 17:55.033
This problem goes deeper
than I thought.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.900
-I'll need steak and cheesecake.
-Get out!

17:57.967 --> 17:59.967
-Dorothy.
-Out!

18:00.033 --> 18:02.066
I'll just leave you the brochure.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.667
Can you believe that man?

18:06.734 --> 18:09.367
He thought he was
going to help us.

18:09.433 --> 18:12.567
Well, he had one good idea.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.934
What was that?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.633
-Cheesecake.
-Cheesecake.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.700
I cannot understand
what you ever saw in that man.

18:20.767 --> 18:27.367
Picture a man 20 pounds lighter,
long wavy hair, rippling muscles.

18:27.433 --> 18:29.367
I can't believe Stan
ever looked like that.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.233
He didn't.

18:30.300 --> 18:34.567
If I'd ever met a man like that,
I'd never have married Stan.

18:34.633 --> 18:37.166
Maybe we shouldn't
be so tough on him.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.900
This brochure
looks interesting

18:38.967 --> 18:41.133
once you overlook
the turbaned guy

18:41.200 --> 18:43.867
waving from the Rolls Royce.

18:43.934 --> 18:47.000
Those things are silly.

18:47.066 --> 18:50.734
"The unexamined life
is a life not worth living."

18:50.800 --> 18:52.133
That's very deep.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.500
And if you're into this stuff,
very reasonable.

18:54.567 --> 19:00.533
It's $17.95 for that slogan printed
on a turban-shaped night light.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.867
Oh, that is so typical.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.767
Those swamis
are just out for a buck.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.300
They can't teach you anything

19:07.367 --> 19:10.133
anyone with any common sense
doesn't already know.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.633
I didn't know that.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.033
A visual aid.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.467
Oh, really, Ram Dass?

19:17.533 --> 19:21.400
If it's all so easy,
let's hear you answer this question.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.500
"Describe your best friend."

19:23.567 --> 19:25.767
That's a really good question.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.934
I'd love to hear the answer.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.867
Well, my best friend is a woman,

19:31.934 --> 19:34.700
someone I have
a great deal in common with.

19:34.767 --> 19:37.633
-Is she pretty?
-Yeah. She's attractive.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.567
Attractive as in wholesome?

19:39.633 --> 19:42.834
Or attractive as in drop-dead
stunningly gorgeous?

19:42.900 --> 19:45.900
Attractive as in attractive.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.033
All right. What else?

19:48.100 --> 19:53.000
She's someone I share
my innermost secrets with

19:53.066 --> 19:55.066
in strictest confidence.

19:55.133 --> 19:58.600
Like when you told me
you borrowed Blanche's car,

19:58.667 --> 20:02.033
dented it,
and said the bag boy did it?

20:05.166 --> 20:08.066
That's not a secret.
I just forgot to mention it.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.033
I think she means
more like the time

20:11.100 --> 20:14.700
she went skinny-dipping
with your cousin Lars

20:14.767 --> 20:17.734
before he gave up the pulpit.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.233
That's a better example of a secret.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.767
Then I am your best friend.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.333
She's been talking about me.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.533
I wasn't talking about
either one of you.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.633
-What?
-What?

20:31.700 --> 20:34.433
I've been talking
about both of you.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.367
How could I choose
between you two?

20:37.433 --> 20:40.367
You're both my best friends.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.934
Dorothy, how sweet.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.834
That gives me a warm,
tingly feeling.

20:46.900 --> 20:51.200
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go
slip under the covers and enjoy it.

20:53.834 --> 20:56.333
Ok, Dorothy, she's gone.
You can tell me the truth.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.667
You were talking about me,
weren't you?

20:58.734 --> 21:01.867
It will be our little secret.

21:01.934 --> 21:05.200
That and the dent
in Blanche's car.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.000
Gotcha.

21:09.834 --> 21:12.967
-You're such a liar.
-What?

21:13.033 --> 21:14.767
Neither of them is your best friend.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.400
I'm your best friend.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.400
You're right.

21:18.467 --> 21:21.200
I was talking about you, Ma.

21:21.266 --> 21:26.533
You are my best friend,
just like I'm your best friend.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.533
Best friend? Please.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.967
You aren't even my favorite child.

21:32.433 --> 21:36.800
When you were 13, there were
neighbor children I liked better.

21:36.867 --> 21:39.700
Pick up a tab once in a while,
Pal O' Mine.

21:39.767 --> 21:42.633
Or let me open my own
social security check.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.867
Best friend.
Yeah. Right.

21:48.367 --> 21:52.333
That little exercise certainly did
not enhance things here.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.667
I wouldn't say that.

21:53.734 --> 21:56.066
After ma blabbed the truth,

21:56.133 --> 21:59.767
you turned the silent treatment
into an art form.

21:59.834 --> 22:02.834
-(timer dings)
-Oh. There's my cake.

22:02.900 --> 22:06.433
You cannot eat cake
after that big bowl of pasta.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
It's not healthy.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.533
Sophia, I just thought of something.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.734
You're worried about losing a pound?

22:12.800 --> 22:16.433
You may not be the same height
you always were.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.033
Blanche could be right.

22:18.100 --> 22:22.200
This could be exactly
why you're losing weight.

22:22.266 --> 22:25.700
Remember we put
a mark on the wall

22:25.767 --> 22:27.667
to measure how tall we were?

22:27.734 --> 22:29.400
You said they did that at the home

22:29.467 --> 22:32.700
to show how your height
was declining.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.600
Ma, Blanche is right.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.233
You are a little bit shorter.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.567
You needn't worry
about losing weight.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.533
And you don't have to eat that cake.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.900
Why do I feeling you're
happiest about that part?

22:45.967 --> 22:49.867
You mean us have cake?
Honey, we can't. We're dieting.

22:49.934 --> 22:52.000
Sure smells good though.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.066
Looks even better.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.166
Bet you it tastes even better
than that.

22:56.233 --> 22:57.900
I'm throwing it away.

22:57.967 --> 23:00.633
Don't!

23:00.700 --> 23:02.400
Oh, girls, we can't do this.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.066
Now, remember the party.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.900
It's two weeks from Saturday.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.900
No. This year Phyllis
moved it to Sunday.

23:09.967 --> 23:12.200
Then we have an extra day.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.233
We can worry about
our bodies tomorrow.

23:15.967 --> 23:17.400
I'll get the plates.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.333
-I'll get the forks.
-I'll get the hot fudge.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.233
I'll get the butter to grease
the doorway to get you out.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.133
(theme music playing)
