WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.442
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.542 --> 00:11.445
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOUR BOSS?

00:11.545 --> 00:13.914
JUST ONCE, JUST TELL ME
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.418
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE THAT BAD.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.453
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT SLEEPING WITH REEVES

00:19.553 --> 00:21.522
IS GONNA BRING BACK
THE GOOD OLD RELIABLE

00:21.622 --> 00:23.457
ANGRY, CONTROLLING JAKE,

00:23.557 --> 00:26.260
THE ONE WHO FIGHTS YOU
AND THREATENS YOU?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.995
YOUR FATHER DIED
WHEN YOU WERE 13?

00:28.096 --> 00:30.764
- YES.
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY DEVASTATED.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.101
I WAS.
HE WAS A LOVELY MAN.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.269
HE WAS AFFECTIONATE
AND GREAT.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.572
AND YET WHEN JAKE IS TENDER
AND HE EXPRESSES HIS LOVE

00:38.672 --> 00:40.441
THROUGH TENDERNESS,
IT MAKES YOU ANGRY.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.310
DO YOU FEEL THAT
YOU DESERVE THAT LOVE?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.878
IT'S NOT LOVE.
IT'S NEEDINESS.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.647
IT'S WEAKNESS.
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.049
SO IT'S ONLY LOVE IF HE
CHASES YOU, STALKS YOU,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.619
TAPES YOU, IS JEALOUS
OF YOU, IS THAT IT?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.827
- HELLO, JAKE.
- HEY, PAUL.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.729
- YOU MISS ME?
- ( laughs )

01:04.432 --> 01:07.501
AMY'S ON THE PHONE IN THE CAR.
SHE'LL BE RIGHT IN.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.106
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN SITTING
OUT THERE FOR A WHILE.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.741
YOU GOT A PRETTY NICE
'HOOD HERE.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.577
IT'S COME A LONG WAY
SINCE WE... SINCE WE
BOUGHT THE HOUSE.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.780
I'LL SAY.
THE HOUSES HERE MUST BE IN,
LIKE, THE SEVEN FIGURES, RIGHT?

01:19.880 --> 01:23.651
WHY DO YOU ASK?
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN THE MARKET?

01:23.751 --> 01:26.287
( laughs )
NO, IT'S TOO RICH
FOR MY BLOOD.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.657
BUT, IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD SELL WHILE
THE MARKET'S STILL GOOD.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.592
GET A BUNCH OF ACRES
OVER IN MIDDLEBURG.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.527
YOU EVER BEEN OVER THERE?
HORSE COUNTRY.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.864
I KNOW. MY DAUGHTER
USED TO TAKE

01:36.964 --> 01:39.333
HORSE-RIDING LESSONS
OUT THERE.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.035
I SOMETIMES FOOL AROUND
WITH THE IDEA OF SELLING,
ACTUALLY.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.837
REALLY?

01:43.937 --> 01:47.141
'CAUSE YOU DON'T SEEM THE TYPE
WHO FOOLS AROUND WITH ANYTHING.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.680
- HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?
- LONG TIME NOW.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.915
22 YEARS, MAYBE.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.685
YOU KNOW THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL
GOES THROUGH THIS AREA?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.387
MM-HMM.
I KNEW THAT.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.289
I HIKED THE WHOLE THING
WHEN I WAS 17,

02:01.389 --> 02:03.090
DROPPED OUT OF
HIGH SCHOOL TO DO IT.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.525
- DID I EVER TELL YOU THAT?
- NO.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.196
IN FACT, I EVEN CAME
INTO THE TOWN TO STOCK UP.

02:08.296 --> 02:11.465
MAYBE WE MET 20 YEARS AGO
IN A CONVENIENCE STORE.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.133
HEY, PAUL,

02:13.234 --> 02:15.536
IF A GUY LIKE YOU
AND A GUY LIKE ME MET

02:15.636 --> 02:17.371
UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.574
- YOU THINK WE'D BE FRIENDS?
- POSSIBLE, I SUPPOSE.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.844
BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
THE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC SCENE.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.946
NEITHER DO I, MAN.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.448
WHY DO YOU THINK
I SPEND HALF MY TIME

02:27.548 --> 02:29.617
MAKING CABINETS
FOR A LIVING?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.790
( theme music playing )

02:56.710 --> 03:00.214
WE DROVE HERE
TOGETHER TODAY.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.782
IT'S PART OF THE NEW PLAN:

03:01.882 --> 03:04.218
TRYING TO BE AGREEABLE,

03:04.318 --> 03:05.686
ACCOMMODATING.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.356
SHE WANTED TO COME TOGETHER,
WE DO IT.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.524
SHE WANTED TO DRIVE,
I LET HER.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.026
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE YEARS SINCE
I DROVE WITH HER IN HER CAR,

03:13.126 --> 03:15.896
AND AS SOON AS WE
PULLED OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY,
I REMEMBERED WHY.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.400
YOU SEE, FOR AMY,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.903
THE CAR IS HER FAVORITE
PLACE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS,

03:23.003 --> 03:26.540
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S SAFE TO TALK AND DRIVE

03:26.640 --> 03:29.009
SO SHE HAS TO PULL OVER
AND NOT JUST ANYWHERE, PAUL.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.344
NO, NOT JUST ANYWHERE.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.813
IT HAS TO BE
A PROPER PARKING PLACE.

03:32.913 --> 03:36.284
NO YELLOW CURBS,
NO HANDICAPPED SPACES
FOR THIS LADY.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.419
DO YOU PARK
IN HANDICAPPED SPACES?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.421
NO, I DON'T PARK
IN A HANDICAPPED SPACE,

03:40.521 --> 03:43.657
BUT I'LL PARK IN A YELLOW
OR A RED, SURE.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.626
NOT WORRIED ABOUT
GETTING A TICKET?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.328
NO, FUCK 'EM.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.465
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
OFFER TO DRIVE?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.368
SEE, A WHILE AGO,

03:54.468 --> 03:56.570
I FELL ASLEEP ONCE
AT THE WHEEL--

03:56.670 --> 03:59.773
ONCE, WHILE I WAS TAKING
HER TO THE AIRPORT.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.175
I HAD BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT.
I WAS REALLY TIRED

04:02.276 --> 04:05.078
AND WE WERE STUCK IN TRAFFIC.
I MUST'VE CLOSED MY EYES, PAUL,

04:05.178 --> 04:06.780
FOR NO MORE THAN 10 SECONDS.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.682
NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE'S SCREAMING AT ME,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.584
"GET OUT OF THE CAR.
YOU ALMOST KILLED US."

04:10.684 --> 04:12.653
EVER SINCE THEN,
SHE NEVER LETS ME DRIVE HER

04:12.753 --> 04:14.722
AND I DON'T LIKE TO BE
DRIVEN BY A CHICK.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.461
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS,

04:20.561 --> 04:22.730
SHE'S A MUCH BETTER DRIVER
THAN I AM ANYWAY.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.064
( door opens )

04:24.164 --> 04:26.133
HELLO, PAUL.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.135
HELLO, AMY.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.604
LATE AGAIN, SORRY.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.342
MAKING UP
FOR LAST WEEK.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.944
- WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK?
- I WAS EARLY.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.079
YOU WERE EARLY?

04:39.179 --> 04:41.214
YES, LAST WEEK
I WAS EARLY,

04:41.315 --> 04:43.384
THIS WEEK I'M LATE.
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.656
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.958
- YOU'VE GOT THAT FACE.
- WHAT FACE?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.726
I SAID I WAS SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.295
YOU WANT TO SLAP MY HAND?
GO ON, SLAP MY HAND THEN, JAKE.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.267
I WAS LATE ON PURPOSE.
I THOUGHT YOU AND PAUL
COULD CATCH UP.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.835
AME, IT'S OKAY.
RELAX.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.805
DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX.
IT'S ANNOYING.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.383
SO HOW HAVE YOU BOTH BEEN?

05:15.483 --> 05:18.118
- FINE.
- ( snorts )

05:18.218 --> 05:21.555
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M WELL, THANK YOU.

05:26.259 --> 05:30.097
I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE,
JAKE, THAT AMY AND I MET ALONE

05:30.197 --> 05:32.099
- LAST WEEK.
- HE KNOWS THAT.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.768
YES, I KNOW
HE KNOWS THAT.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.571
THEN WHY DID YOU FIND IT
NECESSARY TO SAY IT?

05:37.671 --> 05:41.208
JUST SO THAT WE'D BE CLEAR.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.143
YEAH, I WAS MEETING
WITH A PRODUCER

05:43.243 --> 05:46.647
WHO'S TALKING ABOUT
BUYING SOME OF MY SONGS
FOR THIS ARTIST OF HIS.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.618
AND, IS HE?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.422
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.990
JUST KIDDING.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.927
OH, YOU'RE JUST KIDDING.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.030
MY BAD. I THINK I LEFT
MY FUNNY DETECTOR IN THE CAR

06:03.130 --> 06:04.632
SO I COULDN'T TELL.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.943
I THINK AMY'S BEEN
REALLY STRESSED OUT
AT WORK, PAUL.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.480
I'M NOT STRESSED OUT.
WORK'S THE SAME
AS USUAL.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.381
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
KILLING YOURSELF.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.183
YOUR BOSS IS
A TOTAL ASSHOLE.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.118
AND HE'S BEEN WORKING
HER TO THE BONE.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.520
- WILL YOU STOP IT?
- WHAT?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.355
"WORKS ME TO THE BONE"--
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
I WORK IN A FACTORY
OR SOMETHING.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.393
LOOK, I JUST THINK
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
TOO HARD, THAT'S ALL.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.328
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
CAN I BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.565
NO, STOP IT.
YOU'RE ANNOYING.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.505
WOW.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.373
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY HERE, PAUL.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.275
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WALK
INTO A MINEFIELD,

06:48.375 --> 06:50.811
USUALLY THERE'S SOME
WARNING SIGNS, RIGHT?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.750
SORRY.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.652
I GUESS I'M
A LITTLE TIRED.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.588
I DON'T GET WHERE
THIS IS ALL COMING FROM.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.590
I THOUGHT WE HAD
A REALLY GOOD WEEK.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.431
AMY, HOW DID YOU...

07:11.532 --> 07:13.934
HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE WEEK?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.440
I JUST THOUGHT BEFORE TODAY,
IT'S BEEN PRETTY SMOOTH SAILING

07:20.541 --> 07:22.810
ON THE SEA OF MATRIMONY
HERE, YOU KNOW?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.078
SHE'D COME HOME,
I'D COOK HER SOME DINNER,

07:25.178 --> 07:27.748
WE'D HAVE A GLASS
OF WINE ON THE PORCH--
I THOUGHT THINGS WERE NICE.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.283
I'VE BECOME YOUR LAPDOG, TOO,
SO THAT HELPS, I GUESS.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.319
MY LAPDOG?

07:32.419 --> 07:33.854
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.657
I'M TALKING ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO,
WHEN I CASTRATED MYSELF

07:36.757 --> 07:39.693
HERE BEFORE YOUR EYES.
DON'T TELL ME YOU
DON'T REMEMBER.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.095
YOU MEAN WHEN YOU WERE HONEST
WITH AMY ABOUT HOW YOU FELT?

07:42.195 --> 07:45.032
YEAH, I MEAN WHEN I BEGGED HER
TO GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.736
DO YOU REGRET THAT?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.971
NO.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.206
I DON'T, NOT IF
THAT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.509
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"IF THAT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS"?

07:55.609 --> 07:58.078
WHAT I MEAN IS I'M TRYING
TO KEEP THE PEACE.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.682
NOW LOOK,
I REALIZE I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE EASIEST GUY TO LOVE

08:01.782 --> 08:04.284
BUT I'M TRYING
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.286
I WANNA MAKE THIS WORK.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.422
SO I'M TRYING.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.059
I REALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE HAPPY THIS WEEK.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.295
OF COURSE YOU DID,
BECAUSE YOU WERE HAPPY.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.997
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS

08:17.097 --> 08:18.932
FAR ENOUGH TO STICK
MY HEAD UP MY OWN ASS.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.400
YOU THINK THAT'S
BEEN EASY FOR ME?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.403
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.639
IF I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.141
IF I BACK OFF, IT'S NO GOOD.
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.444
"I WORRY ABOUT YOU.
I BACK OFF.  I CAN'T WIN."

08:31.545 --> 08:35.048
I, I, I, I.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.364
- AMY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- NOTHING.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.801
- NO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- NO, FORGET IT. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME TODAY.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.169
I'M SORRY.
I'M IN A BAD MOOD.
I'LL JUST MESS THINGS UP.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.639
HE'S BEEN GREAT, REALLY.
JAKE'S JUST WONDERFUL.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.307
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
WRONG WITH ME.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.449
THIS REALLY
JUST STARTED, PAUL.
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN GREAT.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.418
THE LAST TWO WEEKS
HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.653
THERE HASN'T BEEN
A LOT OF DRAMA.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.255
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
ARGUING ABOUT LENNY.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.960
I REALLY...

09:20.060 --> 09:22.495
I REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS
GIVING HER WHAT SHE NEEDS.

09:22.596 --> 09:26.834
( laughs )

09:26.934 --> 09:28.201
SORRY.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.340
- WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?
- SORRY, JAKE.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.275
NO, DID I SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY?

09:35.375 --> 09:38.612
NO, IT'S JUST, YOU SAID
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.650
- YEAH?
- FOR SOME REASON
I FOUND THAT FUNNY.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.555
( laughs )

09:48.656 --> 09:51.925
THAT'S THE FACE
JAKE MAKES WHEN HE'S
ABOUT TO HIT SOMETHING

09:52.025 --> 09:53.694
SO WATCH OUT.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.635
( exhales )

10:06.807 --> 10:09.409
WHAT DO YOU NEED, AMY?
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

10:09.509 --> 10:12.713
- TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.
- I GOT WHAT I NEED-- YOU.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.549
I JUST TOLD YOU,
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS FINE

10:16.650 --> 10:19.252
FOR A CHANGE.
I REALLY DID.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.289
WELL, I'M NOT
COMING HOME EXHAUSTED.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.025
I FALL ASLEEP BECAUSE YOU'VE
BECOME A FUCKING TRANQUILIZER.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.794
AT LEAST WHEN I CAME
IN THE HOUSE

10:26.894 --> 10:28.628
YOU USED TO GRAB MY ASS
OR YOU'D KISS ME.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.563
NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO BE
SO TENDER AND SENSITIVE--

10:30.664 --> 10:33.233
WHEN I GRABBED YOU,
YOU SAID I WAS TREATING YOU
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.868
- SO--
- THAT'S TRUE.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.375
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS
THAT YOU WANT, AMY?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.946
I DON'T KNOW.

10:51.218 --> 10:54.454
I WANNA GO HOME.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE TODAY.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.489
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.491
WHY DO YOU
THINK THAT, AMY?

10:58.591 --> 11:00.060
JUST...

11:00.160 --> 11:02.629
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.664
- MY STOMACH ACHES.
- Jake: HOW CONVENIENT.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.467
AMY GETS THESE
PERFECTLY-TIMED STOMACHACHES.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.469
THEY'RE LIKE
HER SECRET WEAPONS.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.438
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME TEA, AMY?

11:11.538 --> 11:14.074
HUH-UH.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.877
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?
DOES IT FEEL--

11:16.977 --> 11:20.113
IT FEELS LIKE SHE'S
HAVING A CONVERSATION
SHE'D RATHER NOT HAVE.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.715
I'M ASKING AMY.

11:21.815 --> 11:26.053
IT FEELS LIKE
MY STOMACH IS CRAMPING.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.389
THE CLASSIC
STOMACH CRAMP.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.690
YOU SEE, IT'S JUST
VAGUE ENOUGH

11:30.791 --> 11:34.594
TO BE COMPLETELY
UNTREATABLE.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.064
IS IT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'VE HAD BEFORE?

11:45.372 --> 11:48.208
I HAD THE FIRST ONE
WHEN MY FATHER DIED,

11:48.308 --> 11:51.044
BUT A THOUSAND TIMES
WORSE THAN THIS.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.813
YOU KNOW?

12:01.755 --> 12:03.723
I REMEMBER
I COULDN'T STAND UP.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.626
I WAS LYING CURLED UP
ON THE PAVEMENT

12:06.726 --> 12:09.196
WITH TEARS STREAMING
OUT OF MY EYES

12:10.530 --> 12:11.999
AND I COULDN'T MOVE.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.969
WHERE WAS THIS?

12:18.305 --> 12:21.541
OUTSIDE AN ICE CREAM STORE.
THAT'S WHERE HE DIED.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.911
HE TOOK ME
FOR AN ICE CREAM.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.779
MY MOTHER WAS
IN A HORRIBLE MOOD

12:25.879 --> 12:27.915
AND I WENT
TO MY DAD'S OFFICE

12:28.015 --> 12:29.850
AND SAID "I WANNA
RUN AWAY" AND HE SAID,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.185
"THAT'S OKAY.
I WANNA RUN AWAY TOO,

12:32.285 --> 12:35.188
BUT LET'S STOP FIRST
AND GET AN ICE CREAM."

12:35.288 --> 12:37.657
AND I KNEW WHAT HE WAS
DOING BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.893
I JUST WANTED TO GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE

12:39.993 --> 12:41.394
AND SPEND TIME
WITH MY DAD.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.764
WE SAT DOWN ON THE CURB
OUTSIDE THE STORE,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
EATING OUR
ICE CREAM CONES

12:46.533 --> 12:49.269
AND WE WERE RACING TO SEE
WHO COULD FINISH FIRST

12:49.369 --> 12:51.238
AND I WON.

12:51.338 --> 12:54.474
SO I ASKED HIM FOR MONEY
TO BUY ANOTHER CONE

12:54.574 --> 12:56.910
AND I WENT BACK INSIDE

12:57.010 --> 12:59.179
AND A CAR SWUNG...

13:01.481 --> 13:04.451
INTO THE PARKING LOT
AND PLOWED RIGHT INTO HIM.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.422
ONE MINUTE HE WAS
SITTING THERE

13:09.522 --> 13:11.391
AND THE NEXT
HE WAS DEAD.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.264
DID YOU
SEE IT HAPPEN?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.504
YES, IT HAPPENED
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

13:24.604 --> 13:28.608
THERE WAS THIS WAVE OF PAIN
THROUGH MY STOMACH.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.045
IT FOLDED ME OVER.
I HAD TO LIE DOWN
ON THE PAVEMENT.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.747
I COULDN'T EVEN STAND UP
AND THERE WERE PEOPLE
STARING AT ME.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.418
SOMEONE CAME OVER
AND TRIED TO TOUCH ME
TO HELP ME

13:38.518 --> 13:41.021
AND I JUST STARTED SCREAMING,
THE PAIN WAS SO GREAT.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.524
AND THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED
WITH TWO STRETCHERS.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.927
THEY PUT MY FATHER ON ONE...

13:51.098 --> 13:53.867
AND ME ON THE OTHER AND THEY
TOOK ME TO THE HOSPITAL

13:53.967 --> 13:56.503
AND MY FATHER TO THE MORGUE.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.109
I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER
EVER FORGAVE ME.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.280
FORGAVE YOU FOR WHAT?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.419
IT'S OKAY.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.031
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
- OH, SHUT UP.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.533
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.271
WHAT? NO, YOU WERE
JUST A KID--

14:31.371 --> 14:32.805
STOP IT!

14:32.906 --> 14:34.908
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.709
YOU DON'T
KNOW ME AT ALL.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.611
I'VE DONE TERRIBLE
TERRIBLE THINGS.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.847
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT--
- NO, REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.582
I HAD SEX WITH BEN.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.392
I DIDN'T EVEN ENJOY IT.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.327
FELT LIKE A WHORE.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.596
HE PICKED ME UP
FROM HERE LAST WEEK

14:56.696 --> 14:58.298
AND WE WENT OUT DRINKING.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.534
AND THEN WE WENT
BACK TO THE OFFICE
AND FUCKED ON THE FLOOR.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.103
EVERYONE HAD GONE.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.805
HE KEPT SAYING
DISGUSTING THINGS,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.540
DEGRADING THINGS.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.878
AND WHILE I WAS DOING IT,
I WAS ASKING MYSELF,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.747
"WHY AM I DOING THIS?"
BUT I COULDN'T STOP.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.716
WHEN WE FINISHED,
HE SAID, "LOCK UP.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.287
I'M TIRED."
AND HE WALKED OUT.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.323
I SAT ALONE
FOR TWO HOURS,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.858
DRINKING COFFEE,

15:25.959 --> 15:28.228
THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.863
AND I PLANNED
TO COME HOME AND TELL YOU

15:30.964 --> 15:32.365
AND QUIT MY JOB
THE NEXT DAY.

15:32.465 --> 15:36.469
BUT IN THE CAB
ON THE WAY HOME, I REALIZED

15:36.569 --> 15:38.538
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.595
( laughing )

16:02.695 --> 16:03.930
YOU'RE LAUGHING.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.965
APPARENTLY SO.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.836
( laughs )

16:09.936 --> 16:12.172
- HOW CAN YOU BE LAUGHING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.012
WHAT IS HE DOING?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.681
MAYBE HE'S RELIEVED.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.052
YEAH.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.419
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S IT.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.289
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY IT--
I'M RELIEVED.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.094
THIS IS...

16:40.167 --> 16:42.402
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY...

16:43.303 --> 16:45.505
MY WORST NIGHTMARE,

16:45.605 --> 16:48.508
WHAT I'M SCARED OF THE MOST.
AND NOW IT'S HAPPENED

16:48.608 --> 16:52.345
AND I FEEL LIKE...

16:52.445 --> 16:55.882
I FEEL LIKE THIS HUGE WEIGHT HAS
BEEN LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.484
IT'S GONE.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.362
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.332
YEAH.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.601
AND SAD--
I THINK IT'S SAD.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.237
I THINK IT'S REALLY SAD
THAT A WOMAN WHOSE
HUSBAND BREAKS DOWN

17:17.337 --> 17:19.372
IN FRONT OF HER, TELLS HER
HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER,

17:19.472 --> 17:22.109
GOES OUT AND FUCKS SOMEONE ELSE
AND HURTS HERSELF SO BAD.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.510
I THINK THAT'S SAD.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.185
DO YOU THINK
IT'S RELATED, JAKE?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.889
YOUR TELLING AMY
THAT YOU LOVE HER

17:36.989 --> 17:38.391
AND HER CHEATING
ON YOU?

17:38.491 --> 17:42.329
YEAH, IT SEEMS
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME.

17:42.429 --> 17:46.032
BUT WHAT'S SURPRISING ME,
PAUL, IS--

17:46.133 --> 17:47.934
AND MAYBE I'M JUST
IN SHOCK--

17:48.034 --> 17:50.036
IS THAT
I DON'T FEEL JEALOUS.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.406
I DON'T FEEL
JEALOUS OR ANGRY.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.812
MY GOD, I THINK I AM REALLY
BEING OUTSTANDING HERE, GUYS.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.416
I MEAN, IS ANYONE ELSE
AS IMPRESSED WITH ME AS I AM?

18:03.516 --> 18:06.085
I'VE IMAGINED THIS OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

18:06.186 --> 18:08.388
AND I CAN TELL YOU
THAT I'VE NEVER--

18:12.892 --> 18:16.663
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE NEVER
BEHAVED LIKE SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.977
YEAH, I JUST--
I FEEL SAD.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.346
FOR HER, FOR US.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.826
HE'S RIGHT
ABOUT THE CONNECTION

18:46.926 --> 18:48.261
BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED
WITH BEN

18:48.361 --> 18:50.997
AND WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.633
FROM THE MOMENT
JAKE BROKE DOWN,

18:53.733 --> 18:56.636
I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE
I WAS GONNA LOSE CONTROL.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.441
JAKE...

19:03.810 --> 19:05.712
I FEEL AWFUL.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.352
SAY SOMETHING.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.693
HOW MANY TIMES
DID THIS HAPPEN?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.362
JUST ONCE.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.265
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.908
WHY DID I DO THIS?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.245
MAYBE YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED

19:38.345 --> 19:41.648
TO MAKE JAKE ANGRY
BECAUSE--

19:41.748 --> 19:44.817
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
TRUST HIS TENDERNESS

19:44.917 --> 19:46.052
AND BECAUSE THERE'S

19:46.152 --> 19:48.855
SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE YOU

19:48.955 --> 19:50.657
THAT WANTS TO BE PUNISHED.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.695
BUT JAKE HAS BEEN
WORKING HARD LATELY

19:55.795 --> 19:58.265
TO BE MORE PATIENT,
TO BE MORE SUPPORTIVE.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.834
AND HE'S NO LONGER
GIVING YOU WHAT YOU NEED

20:01.934 --> 20:03.603
IN THAT WAY.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.611
AND NOW THAT JAKE HAS
STOPPED PUNISHING YOU,

20:11.711 --> 20:13.680
YOU'VE STARTED TO PUNISH
YOURSELF BY HAVING SEX

20:13.780 --> 20:15.382
WITH SOMEBODY THAT,
AS YOU SAID YOURSELF,

20:15.482 --> 20:18.518
YOU FIND REPULSIVE.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.225
YOU SAID THAT
AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED

20:26.326 --> 20:28.395
YOUR MOTHER
NEVER FORGAVE YOU.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.033
MAYBE YOU'VE NEVER
FORGIVEN YOURSELF, AMY,

20:34.133 --> 20:35.635
FOR LEAVING
YOUR FATHER ON THE CURB

20:35.735 --> 20:38.838
WHILE YOU WENT
TO GET AN ICE CREAM.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.675
MAYBE YOU FEEL THAT

20:42.775 --> 20:45.412
IF YOU DEGRADE
YOURSELF ENOUGH...

20:47.647 --> 20:50.850
MAYBE SOMEDAY
SOMEBODY WILL FORGIVE YOU...

20:52.419 --> 20:55.722
FOR-- FOR EVERYTHING.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.671
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN ME?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.577
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE WITH ME?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.749
I LOVED YOU.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.487
LOVED?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.429
THAT'S IT?

21:48.107 --> 21:50.343
I DESERVE IT.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.844
YOU CAN HIT ME IF YOU LIKE.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.580
OH, AMY.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.315
- NO, YOU CAN, YOU CAN HIT ME--
- I DON'T WANT TO HIT YOU, AME.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.160
WE HAVE
TO PICK UP LENNY.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.530
- THERE'S STILL TIME.
- WELL, I REALLY WANNA SEE HIM.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.432
NO, DON'T GO.
DON'T GO!

22:12.532 --> 22:15.201
IT'S TOO EARLY AND THE CLASS
DOESN'T FINISH UNTIL 7:00.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.169
JUST DON'T GO, PLEASE.
LET'S JUST SIT HERE.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.105
LET'S JUST SIT HERE
WITH PAUL.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.608
LET'S JUST BE QUIET
FOR A MINUTE.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.586
WILL HE FORGIVE ME?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.026
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?
