WEBVTT

00:11.220 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.849
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.933 --> 00:18.101
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.185 --> 00:20.062
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.145 --> 00:22.523
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.606 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:26.276 --> 00:30.697
Today I'll be teaching you new bots how the reboot process works.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.659
First, we take something humans no longer want.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.993
Like that old jug.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.078
That's right, Doug.

00:36.161 --> 00:40.332
Then we scan the jug to find out what we can turn it into that humans will want.

00:40.415 --> 00:44.211
Then we press this button and that old jug becomes...

00:45.587 --> 00:48.215
-A new pail. -Right again, son.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.342
Then we take the brand-new pail--

00:52.052 --> 00:54.429
We take the new pail and--

00:55.097 --> 00:56.098
Okay?

01:01.144 --> 01:02.729
Dad, look.

01:03.438 --> 01:08.986
-Boop, boop. Beep, beep. -It's just a Critter Bot.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.239
These little robot creatures live all around Rebots.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.033
Hi, little bot. Where did you get this dish?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.244
Probably from the warehouse.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.122
I rebooted it earlier today out of an old helmet.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.541
It's called a pet dish.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.253
"Pet"? I've never heard that word before. What does it mean?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.630
You know, I'm not sure, son.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.757
Time to plug in to find out.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.762
I love my pets and they love me

01:36.138 --> 01:38.682
Mini members of the family

01:39.057 --> 01:41.935
They stay on my tail So I'm never alone

01:42.019 --> 01:44.938
Get up to mischief When I'm not at home

01:45.022 --> 01:48.066
Peppy dogs, sleepy cats Smiley rabbits eating snacks

01:48.150 --> 01:51.486
Chatty birds, pretty fish Majestic long-haired guinea pigs

01:53.947 --> 01:56.742
I love my pets and they love me too

01:59.703 --> 02:01.246
-It's snuggle time -Yeah

02:01.330 --> 02:03.248
-They're so cute -Pets

02:03.957 --> 02:08.252
I see. A pet is an animal humans live with and take care of.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.464
Only, I have a big question.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.424
Why do people have pets?

02:12.841 --> 02:17.429
Hey. Look, Doug. Your friend Emma just ordered the pet dish.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.849
It must be for her pet, Princess Woofingham.

02:20.933 --> 02:24.478
I'll unplug and blast over to see if she can answer my question.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.323
Doug, it's you. Are you here because you found my lucky shoes?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.033
Actually--

02:38.116 --> 02:41.662
Dad, Doug's here to deliver a new pet dish.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.707
I ordered it for Princess Woofingham.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.501
That's right. But wait.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.044
What are lucky shoes?

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
These are my lucky shoes.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.465
I wear them to every audition.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.551
And today I have a big one!

02:55.634 --> 02:59.721
I'm trying out for a part in a new musical TV show.

03:00.180 --> 03:06.812
But I can't go without my shoes

03:07.104 --> 03:09.857
-Maybe we can help you look, Mr. Pine. -Yeah!

03:10.274 --> 03:12.860
Perfect! Family, spread out.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.532
Now, if I were a pair of lucky shoes, where would I be?

03:18.615 --> 03:21.201
Well, you wouldn't be under the table.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.287
Or in the hall closet.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.500
-Don't see 'em. -Not here either.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.129
There's something back here.

03:35.174 --> 03:38.468
It's a robot dust bunny. Wait, robot dust bunny?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.554
He's actually a Critter Bot.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.723
He must've followed me here from Rebots.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.475
Honey, have you seen my lucky shoes up there?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.811
No, but I'll check the bedrooms.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.897
Great. Could you also check--

03:51.940 --> 03:53.358
Princess Woofingham, please!

03:53.442 --> 03:56.486
I can't concentrate with you... barking like that!

03:56.570 --> 03:58.989
It's all right, Dad. I'll bring her outside.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.867
-Want to help take care of her, Doug? -Yes, please.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.204
-Come on, Critter Bot. -Thanks, kids.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.081
Now, to find those shoes.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.293
Thanks for inviting me to take care of your pet with you, Emma.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.964
I'm excited to help because I wanna know, why do people have pets?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.093
Are you telling me that robots don't have pets?

04:20.177 --> 04:22.346
Most robots don't even know what pets are.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.182
What? But pets are the greatest!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.975
They're cute and cuddly.

04:28.060 --> 04:32.814
And sometimes stinky, but in, like, a totally adorable way.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.276
I mean, just look how happy they are when it's time to feed them.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.863
-Is that why you need a dish? -They eat out of them.

04:39.947 --> 04:45.702
The only problem is that Princess Woofingham kinda chewed up her old one.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.371
Reah.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.081
Looks like she gave it a reboot.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.917
Good thing you came with this new one.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.215
Can you give me a hand?

05:00.259 --> 05:03.011
I don't want an actual hand, Doug.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.806
I mean can you help me lift this bag?

05:06.348 --> 05:07.349
Of course.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.194
My sensors indicate pets can also make you laugh.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.279
Totally!

05:24.575 --> 05:26.535
I don't think Critter Bot knows how to eat this.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.287
Maybe I can make it more robot-y.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.594
Guess Princess Woofingham is done eating too.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.304
So what does she want now, Emma?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.139
To play, of course.

05:47.222 --> 05:51.602
That's another important and amazingly fun part of taking care of pets.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.689
Come on, Doug. I'll show you.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.525
Woof woof Woofity woof woof

05:58.609 --> 06:01.695
Woof

06:01.778 --> 06:04.406
Woof woof Woofity woof woof

06:04.489 --> 06:07.701
-Woof -Woof

06:13.081 --> 06:15.792
Whoops. Guess I don't know my own robo-strength.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.252
We'll get that one later.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.009
I told you dogs like to play.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.261
Yeah, and we got to play too.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.846
Isn't that right, Critter Bot?

06:32.017 --> 06:35.854
Would you look at that? It's Doug and his best bud.

06:35.938 --> 06:36.939
Hi, Jenny.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.316
What are you delivering today? Something good?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.068
Something amazing!

06:41.151 --> 06:43.737
It's an item that makes humans go really fast.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.490
Is it a... car?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.368
-A jetpack? -A car powered by a jetpack?

06:49.451 --> 06:53.789
Better. It's these things called running shoes.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.041
Shoes, shoes.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.710
Princess Woofingham, come back!

06:58.794 --> 07:01.713
Yowzah! And I thought these shoes could run.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.925
I think she's trying to get in the house.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.762
And it looks like your dad still hasn't found his lucky shoes.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.266
No. No, Princess Woofingham! We can't go inside.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.399
Good idea, Critter Bot.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.693
We can take her for a walk instead.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.570
Do dogs like walks?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.406
Dogs live for walks, Doug!

07:28.073 --> 07:29.199
Come on!

07:36.540 --> 07:38.625
Do you wanna try to hold the leash, Doug?

07:38.709 --> 07:40.544
Yes, please. Only, what's it for?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.171
It's so she doesn't run away.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.591
Just like that.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.637
This dog is as fast as a rocket.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.181
Wait, a rocket!

07:54.725 --> 07:56.894
Go, Doug! Go, Doug!

07:56.977 --> 07:58.562
Go, Dougy Doug!

08:02.232 --> 08:05.068
Princess Woofingham, you might want to turn.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.320
Any time now!

08:07.112 --> 08:09.031
You're headed straight for a...

08:10.741 --> 08:11.742
mud puddle.

08:12.534 --> 08:16.371
Wow, that's another thing pets do. They keep you really active.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.248
Maybe a little too active.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.542
This pooch needs a good cleaning.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.127
How do we clean a dog?

08:22.211 --> 08:24.338
We clean dogs by giving them baths.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.800
Really? We're going to put Princess Woofingham in one of those?

08:29.218 --> 08:31.011
Well, kind of.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.347
We gotta get you clean.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.640
You missed a spot.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.601
Right over there.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.691
Beep, beep, boop! Boop, beep, beep, boop, beep! Boop.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.985
Thanks for helping us clean up, Critter Bot.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.156
Good thing I'm waterproof.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.284
Are you starting to see why we keep pets, Doug?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.497
Girls, anything out there?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.874
Just a clean doggy.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.085
No shoes!

09:03.168 --> 09:07.089
No shoes!

09:07.172 --> 09:10.634
No! Tabatha, Agatha, don't let her...

09:11.343 --> 09:13.679
get inside.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.641
Oh, no! Bubbles everywhere!

09:18.308 --> 09:19.434
Beep!

09:19.518 --> 09:22.354
Come on, Princess. We have to let Dad look for his--

09:27.442 --> 09:31.238
My lucky shoes!

09:35.534 --> 09:37.494
Hooray for Princess Woofingham.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.164
That's why she kept trying to get inside the house.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.126
Because she knew where the lucky shoes were all this time.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.795
Who's a good girl? Yes, you are. You're a good girl.

09:46.879 --> 09:50.132
Yes, you are. Little good girl. Yes, you are. You're a good girl.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.178
Now I can go to my audition.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.639
Who's going to get the part?

09:57.723 --> 10:00.726
Me, me, me, me

10:00.809 --> 10:02.686
-Yay, bravo! -All right, Daddy!

10:02.769 --> 10:04.521
That's my dad!

10:04.605 --> 10:05.814
Thank you!

10:05.898 --> 10:09.651
But most of all, thank you, Princess Woofingham.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.570
You truly saved the day.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.037
Beep, boop!

10:20.829 --> 10:23.457
Wow! I learned why people have pets.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.001
They can make you laugh and play.

10:26.084 --> 10:30.297
They can even take care of you, like when they find your lucky shoes.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.927
But most of all, they love you just as much as you love them.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.139
I've gotta tell my parents about this.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.393
Mom, Dad, can we get a pet?

10:44.353 --> 10:45.354
A what?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.481
They're animals that you take care of.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.400
And today, I learned all about how to do it.

10:50.484 --> 10:54.738
You feed pets... and you play with them.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.494
And you walk them.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.498
And you have to keep them clean.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.254
But most importantly, you give them love, and they give you love back.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.173
Kind of like this.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.717
I had such a fun day with you, little bot.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.973
Great gears! Maybe this little Critter Bot could be our pet.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.933
That's a wonderful idea, Doug.

11:23.517 --> 11:27.729
Looks like our little robo-family has added a new member.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.448
All right, Doug, today we're nature photographers,

11:38.866 --> 11:43.078
so we're gonna take pictures of all the amazing critters in my backyard.

11:44.288 --> 11:48.417
-Is that a critter, Emma? -Yeah! It's a squirrel, Doug.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.755
And there's a ladybug, a bird.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.718
An incredibly furry and beautiful dog.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.263
-Quack, quack! -I think I see another bird.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.643
Doug, that's not just a bird.

12:06.727 --> 12:10.063
That's the most adorable baby duckling I've ever seen.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.567
In fact, he's so cute that I just gotta...

12:13.650 --> 12:16.653
somersault in adorableness!

12:18.614 --> 12:20.699
Hello, little ducky.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.743
I wonder where he came from.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.162
Wait a minute, Doug.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.790
Cute baby ducklings aren't supposed to be in my backyard.

12:28.874 --> 12:29.875
They aren't?

12:29.958 --> 12:33.378
No! This baby duckling is out of his habitat.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.546
Habitat?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.382
I've never heard that word before.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.968
Time to plug in to find out what it means.

12:43.514 --> 12:47.476
This is my home Built to support me

12:47.559 --> 12:51.563
It's where I belong Living snug and cozy

12:51.647 --> 12:52.481
Look

12:52.564 --> 12:56.318
I'm a bird in my nest A fox in my den

12:56.735 --> 12:58.654
A mole in my hole

12:58.737 --> 13:01.365
We make homes in our natural habitats

13:01.448 --> 13:03.659
My home's in my habitat In my habitat

13:03.742 --> 13:05.953
Home's in my habitat In my habitat

13:06.036 --> 13:08.121
Home's in my habitat In my habitat

13:08.205 --> 13:09.456
Home's in my habitat

13:09.540 --> 13:11.834
Natural habitat

13:12.251 --> 13:15.796
I see. A habitat is what you call an animal's home.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.090
It's something every animal needs.

13:18.674 --> 13:21.301
Only, I have a big question.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.179
What would be a good home for this duck?

13:25.347 --> 13:26.348
Quack?

13:26.431 --> 13:27.641
I don't know, Doug.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.770
But I have a room full of craft supplies we can use to make him one!

13:34.481 --> 13:35.899
Then let's get crafting.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.781
Here we are.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.951
Welcome to my room, little duck.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.911
Wait, little duck?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.997
We can't keep calling you that.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.208
But what should your name be?

13:54.918 --> 13:55.961
He likes to quack.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.130
Maybe we could call him--

13:58.213 --> 13:59.298
Computing.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.135
-Quackerino? -Love it!

14:03.218 --> 14:04.386
Quackerino!

14:05.762 --> 14:07.139
I think he likes it too.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.891
All right, Quackerino.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.269
We're gonna turn this place into the perfect home for you.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.648
Just look at all the crafting supplies we can use!

14:16.732 --> 14:19.026
We've got pom-poms, string,

14:19.109 --> 14:22.321
markers, paper, shells, glitter...

14:22.779 --> 14:25.199
Oops. Well, you get the idea.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.075
So, what do we make first, Emma?

14:27.159 --> 14:31.121
It's up to Quackerino. His quack is our command.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.206
Quack!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.711
That doesn't sound like a happy quack.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.513
I don't think he's happy here!

14:49.306 --> 14:50.307
Gotcha.

14:50.390 --> 14:55.270
You know, Emma, I'm starting to think ducks and crafts don't mix.

14:56.355 --> 14:59.650
Yeah, but then how else can we make this duck a home?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.610
What about Rebots?

15:01.693 --> 15:05.197
We robots don't craft, but we can make almost anything.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.324
Great idea, Doug. Let's go!

15:08.867 --> 15:11.328
Right after we do a quick cleanup.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.831
Welcome to Rebots, Quackerino.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.960
As you can see, all sorts of robots live and work here.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.086
Including my dad.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.507
-Hi, Dad. -Hello, Doug and Emma.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.051
This is our new friend Quackerino.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.930
And hello, Mr. Quackerino. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.933
I said, "Pleasure to make your--"

15:33.016 --> 15:35.102
He's a duck, Dad. They don't shake hands.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.313
That's how they shake.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.190
Okay then.

15:40.274 --> 15:43.443
Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Quackerino.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.612
We're trying to find a home for him,

15:45.696 --> 15:48.574
and we thought we could make him one here in Rebots.

15:48.657 --> 15:54.121
A fantastic idea, son. You could use one of our hi-tech reboot booths.

15:54.204 --> 15:57.082
All we need is the right item to reboot and presto!

15:58.250 --> 16:01.879
So, what would you like us to make first, Mr. Quackerino?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.757
He must've waddled off.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.634
That's not good.

16:07.718 --> 16:10.762
That little duck could be anywhere on our big factory floor.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.306
We gotta find him!

16:13.348 --> 16:15.100
Quackerino.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.478
Quackerino?

16:22.441 --> 16:24.276
Here, ducky, ducky, ducky.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.822
Quackerino?

16:31.450 --> 16:33.202
Here, ducky, ducky, ducky!

16:35.287 --> 16:36.371
Quackerino!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.041
-Quackerino! -Here, ducky, ducky.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.792
No luck finding the duck?

16:41.585 --> 16:42.753
Quackerino!

16:42.836 --> 16:46.048
The name's actually Bob Bot but-- There's a duck on my head.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.467
How'd he get there?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.056
You know, Emma,

16:54.139 --> 16:57.601
I'm not sure Rebots is a great place to make a home for a duck either.

16:57.684 --> 17:02.397
Yeah, but if Quackerino can't live in my house or your house,

17:02.481 --> 17:04.358
where can he live?

17:08.654 --> 17:10.656
Wait! Hold your microchips.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.785
Emma, we've been trying to make Quackerino's home inside.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.329
But maybe we should make him a home outside.

17:20.624 --> 17:25.253
According to my data, it looks like ducks do live outside in ponds.

17:27.297 --> 17:31.218
Ponds! Of course! They're always outside.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.095
Superb researching, son,

17:33.178 --> 17:37.933
and if you wanna make a pond, well, I've got just the thing to use.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.143
You're right, Mr. Bot.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.230
That kiddie pool is perfect for our pond.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.444
And this is the perfect place to put a pond.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.992
Don't worry, Quackerino. We're gonna make you a home right here.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.119
It's time to build this pond.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.871
I'll be in charge of the water.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.498
Water drones, assemble!

18:19.266 --> 18:22.853
Quackerino, welcome to Rebots Pond, your new home.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.941
Come on, little guy. Hop in.

18:37.075 --> 18:41.205
We did it, Emma. I think we finally made the right home for our duck.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.045
Or maybe not, Doug.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.757
He still doesn't seem very happy.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.845
But we matched our pond to the picture. Maybe we need more lily pads.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.807
-Or logs, or reeds. -Or water?

19:00.891 --> 19:03.810
Water drones, one more bucket, please.

19:08.649 --> 19:09.900
Oh, no!

19:11.527 --> 19:12.569
Not that much.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.909
Quackerino, come back-erino!

19:24.915 --> 19:29.294
Doug. What are we gonna do? Our homemade pond didn't work.

19:29.378 --> 19:32.339
Yeah. How will we ever find a good home for the duck?

19:34.550 --> 19:37.177
Doug, what's your antenna doing?

19:37.261 --> 19:38.846
It's picking something up.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.017
I can hear a sound. I'll transmit it through my speak ears.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.694
Doug, ducks! Those are ducks, Doug.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.488
I think Quackerino recognizes them.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.032
Then let's follow my antenna.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.827
That's it. Let's go, Quackerino.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.581
Come on. Hold still, little ducky.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.416
Won't let me pick you up?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.127
Well, then, you'll just have to follow us.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.715
And the way to get a duck to follow us is to walk like a duck.

20:14.798 --> 20:15.799
Like this?

20:18.594 --> 20:19.595
Quack!

20:19.678 --> 20:25.142
Doug, you, my friend, are a treasure. And not just because you're gold.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.732
It's working, Emma. Quackerino's following me.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.442
This way.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.235
Let's waddle to the ducks.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.508
It's a real pond.

21:08.727 --> 21:12.648
Doug, those ducks must be Quackerino's family!

21:13.732 --> 21:16.443
So that's what our Rebots pond was missing.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.487
We can't reboot that.

21:20.239 --> 21:21.782
Look how happy he is.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.744
Doug, that is seriously so cute.

21:26.286 --> 21:30.249
I have to somersault in adorableness!

21:33.460 --> 21:36.672
Plus, I think we learned what the best home for a duck is.

21:36.755 --> 21:37.923
What's that, Doug?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.466
His real one.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.343
When it comes to an animal's home,

21:41.426 --> 21:44.680
a natural habitat has everything it truly needs.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.185
Nature is so wonderful.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.479
And we're nature photographers.

21:52.563 --> 21:53.814
Come on.

21:53.897 --> 21:57.109
I can't wait to show these photos to my parent bots.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.197
So, how was your day, Doug?

22:02.281 --> 22:03.657
It was great, Mom!

22:03.740 --> 22:06.285
Emma and I took pictures of lots of animals.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.620
This is one of my favorites.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.874
Is that my old pal, Mr. Quackerino?

22:12.249 --> 22:14.960
Yep, and here he is with his family.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.671
Now that's a happy duck.

22:17.754 --> 22:22.342
That's because he's where he belongs, Mom, with his family in their natural habitat.

22:22.759 --> 22:26.388
Just like I'm happiest right where I belong, home with you.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.974
We're happiest with you too, Doug.

22:30.142 --> 22:32.227
Bots in their natural habitat.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.376
My home's in my habitat In my habitat

22:56.460 --> 22:58.670
Home's in my habitat In my habitat

22:58.754 --> 23:00.923
Home's in my habitat In my habitat

23:01.006 --> 23:04.301
Home's in my habitat Natural habitat
