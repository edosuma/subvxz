09:13.379 --> 09:15.053
HOW DO YOU GRILL THESE
SO PERFECTLY?

09:16.163 --> 09:20.047
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SOMETHING MY DAD TAUGHT ME.

09:20.747 --> 09:22.212
UM, HE HAS
A RESTAURANT.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.242
IT HAS TO DO WITH GETTING THE,
UH, OVEN HOT ENOUGH.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.467
MMM.

09:36.819 --> 09:37.882
OK.

09:38.002 --> 09:39.372
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

09:39.572 --> 09:41.841
YOU WERE TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR DESIGNS.

09:42.131 --> 09:43.937
RIGHT, RIGHT, UM...

09:44.677 --> 09:46.279
WELL, AS SOON
AS I GET

09:46.309 --> 09:48.108
SOME OF THE KINKS
WORKED OUT,

09:48.108 --> 09:50.545
I'M GONNA BUILD
MY OWN SPEC HOUSE.

09:51.045 --> 09:53.809
YEAH, THE, UH,
PAINTING AND CONSTRUCTION

09:53.809 --> 09:55.332
IS JUST SOMETHING I DO
TO PAY THE BILLS.

09:55.332 --> 09:56.420
CHARLIE--

09:56.420 --> 09:57.727
I WAS UP UNTIL, LIKE,
3:00 IN THE MORNING

09:57.737 --> 10:00.121
TRYING TO WORK OUT
THIS WHOLE CEILING PROBLEM--

10:00.141 --> 10:01.261
CHARLIE...

10:01.991 --> 10:03.950
I LOOKED AT YOUR MODEL
A WEEK AGO.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.433
EVERYTHING'S STILL
EXACTLY THE SAME.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.086
THE PENCIL'S STILL CLIPPED UP
ON THE KITCHEN WALL.

10:10.086 --> 10:12.588
THE COMPASS IS POINTING
AT THE SAME DIRECTION...

10:13.408 --> 10:14.514
RIGHT AT THE BEDROOM.

10:18.529 --> 10:19.618
WHAT?

10:20.697 --> 10:21.849
IT'S OK.

10:22.739 --> 10:26.283
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
A BIG ARCHITECT SOMEDAY.

10:27.653 --> 10:28.856
AND EVEN IF NOT...

10:29.976 --> 10:33.327
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO MAKE IT WITH
FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT.

10:33.677 --> 10:35.158
I CAME HERE
TO MAKE IT WITH YOU.

10:36.888 --> 10:38.506
OH.

10:47.504 --> 10:48.997
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

10:53.580 --> 10:54.612
CHARLIE.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.360
IT'S ME--FELICIA.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.014
YOU'RE TRUCK'S OUTSIDE, CHARLIE,
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

11:03.503 --> 11:05.315
JUST...DON'T
LOSE THAT THOUGHT.

11:12.845 --> 11:14.368
IT'S NOT A GREAT TIME,
FELICIA.

11:14.658 --> 11:16.413
NO,
IT REALLY ISN'T, IS IT?

11:16.413 --> 11:18.721
UH, IS THERE ANY WAY
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

11:18.981 --> 11:20.637
I'LL CALL YOU FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

11:20.657 --> 11:21.751
I'M PREGNANT.

11:21.901 --> 11:23.051
YOU'RE--

11:28.861 --> 11:30.147
WHAT?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.206
I WAS LATE. I PEED ON A STICK.
I'M PREGNANT.

11:32.236 --> 11:33.262
OH, MAN.

11:36.215 --> 11:38.004
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT IT TOMORROW,

11:38.024 --> 11:39.349
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.

11:40.744 --> 11:42.686
YEAH, UH...

11:44.006 --> 11:46.748
TOMORROW, UM,
I'M A LITTLE JAMMED UP.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.010
HMM.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.708
WELL, HERE'S THE ADDRESS
AND THE TIME.

11:54.211 --> 11:56.185
I'D REALLY
LIKE YOU TO BE THERE.

12:07.687 --> 12:08.999
IT'S A DIGITAL SCRAPBOOK

12:09.019 --> 12:10.975
WITH MY NEW ALBUM
AND PRESS PHOTOS AND STUFF.

12:11.015 --> 12:12.448
YOU KNOW,
ALL ON DVD.

12:12.678 --> 12:15.304
BUT THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO
SNEAK BACK OVER TO THE HOUSE.

12:15.354 --> 12:17.538
I HAVE TO HAVE THE OLD SCRAPBOOK
SCANNED BEFORE THE PARTY.

12:17.598 --> 12:19.245
THIS IS KIND OF MOM,
RIGHT? IT'S SILK.

12:19.295 --> 12:21.047
NO.
NO, NO, NO, JULIA.

12:21.087 --> 12:23.755
THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING
MRS. NEINLIEBEN WOULD WEAR.

12:23.915 --> 12:27.911
MOM'S MORE VITAL,
MORE SENSUAL, MORE...

12:28.381 --> 12:29.883
MORE THIS...

12:29.953 --> 12:31.088
HMM, THIS.

12:31.408 --> 12:34.266
YEAH, RIGHT, CLAUD.
AND WE COULD GET ONE FOR DAD, TOO.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.790
YOU DON'T THINK MOM WOULD LOOK
AMAZING IN THIS?

12:36.830 --> 12:38.313
YOU KNOW DAD
WOULD REALLY--

12:38.343 --> 12:41.463
OK, COULD WE PLEASE NOT EVEN CONJECTURE
AS TO THEIR SEX LIFE?

12:41.523 --> 12:43.514
BESIDES, PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WEAR
STUFF LIKE THAT.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.578
IF YOU SAY SO.

12:48.088 --> 12:49.350
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:50.650 --> 12:53.449
NOTHING.
JUST...YOU KNOW.

12:55.179 --> 12:56.862
-YOU?
-NO, CLAUDIA.

12:56.862 --> 12:58.907
I DON'T WEAR THEM
ALL THE TIME.

12:58.907 --> 13:02.128
JUST...YOU KNOW,
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

13:02.128 --> 13:03.700
SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
LIKE WHAT?

13:04.980 --> 13:07.089
I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE SEX.

13:10.063 --> 13:11.071
WAIT...

13:11.811 --> 13:13.402
YOU'VE--
YOU'VE HAD SEX?

13:14.352 --> 13:16.707
DON'T YOU EVEN
READ MY E-MAILS?

13:16.707 --> 13:19.232
I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN DROPPING
SOME SERIOUS HINTS.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.542
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I MEAN...

13:21.382 --> 13:22.583
THAT NEVER
OCCURRED TO ME.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.934
I MEAN, WHEN?
WITH WHO--WHOM?

13:24.974 --> 13:26.668
WHAT, YOU WANT, LIKE,
NAMES AND DATES?

13:26.688 --> 13:28.067
THERE ARE NAMES
AND DATES?

13:28.067 --> 13:29.635
RELAX, JUL,
IT'S JUST...

13:29.895 --> 13:32.836
YOU KNOW, JUST...
A COUPLE OF GUYS.

13:32.956 --> 13:34.237
WAIT,
I'M--I'M SORRY...

13:34.697 --> 13:36.253
YOU'VE HAD SEX
WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

13:36.323 --> 13:39.078
I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD
A VERY LONG TIME.

13:40.328 --> 13:41.645
OH.

13:42.105 --> 13:43.259
ARE YOU OK?

13:43.819 --> 13:45.562
UH-HUH, YEAH.
YEAH, I JUST, UM...

13:45.562 --> 13:47.793
YOU PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING
IN HIGH SCHOOL, THOUGH, RIGHT?

13:47.803 --> 13:49.776
NO, I WAS WITH JUSTIN
IN HIGH SCHOOL, REMEMBER?

13:50.176 --> 13:51.403
BEFORE THAT.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.460
REALLY?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.536
WOW.

13:59.446 --> 14:01.730
OH, NO, NO.
JUL, THAT'S...

14:02.170 --> 14:03.504
THAT IS AMAZING.

14:03.754 --> 14:06.086
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST LIKE
MOM AND DAD, YOU KNOW.

14:06.496 --> 14:08.411
YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE
EARLY AND...

14:08.931 --> 14:11.284
YOU KNOW, MEANTIME
WE'RE JUST OUT HERE

14:11.284 --> 14:13.083
FLAILING AROUND
TRYING TO CATCH UP.

14:20.544 --> 14:22.033
NOT YET, NOT YET.

14:29.212 --> 14:30.441
NOW.

14:30.461 --> 14:31.969
OH, NO, NO, NO.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.451
OK, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.179
WHAT?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.963
YOU KNOW THAT THE CHANGE COMES
ON THE DOWNBEAT.

14:37.963 --> 14:39.486
OK, YOU'VE DONE IT
A THOUSAND TIMES RIGHT.

14:39.486 --> 14:41.151
BUT THE LAST 3 TIMES
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.489
I-IT WAS FINE,
WILL.

14:42.489 --> 14:43.990
LOOK, BAILEY,
DON'T LIE TO ME.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.228
OK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT.

14:45.268 --> 14:46.280
WHAT?

14:46.300 --> 14:48.041
WHATEVER IT IS THAT KEPT YOU
FROM TELLING CLAUDIA.

14:48.761 --> 14:50.801
WILL, COME ON.

14:50.801 --> 14:51.890
I TELL CLAUDIA

14:51.890 --> 14:53.502
AND 2 SECONDS LATER,
MOM AND DAD KNOW, TOO.

14:53.832 --> 14:54.849
SO?

14:54.849 --> 14:56.546
DON'T THEY
NEED TO KNOW

14:56.546 --> 14:58.200
IF YOU'RE
LEAVING SCHOOL?

15:00.847 --> 15:01.914
NOT YET.

15:01.994 --> 15:04.141
WELL, HOW COULD IT
HAVE NOT COME UP?

15:04.511 --> 15:05.860
YOU'RE ON
ACADEMIC PROBATION.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.340
HAVEN'T THEY SEEN
YOUR TRANSCRIPT?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.238
MOM AND DAD SAW MINE,
LIKE, WEEKS AGO.

15:10.996 --> 15:12.115
WHAT?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.107
BAILEY, YOU DIDN'T.

15:14.817 --> 15:17.030
YOU STOOD BY THE MAILBOX
AND WAITED?

15:17.060 --> 15:18.699
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL THEM MYSELF.

15:18.699 --> 15:20.440
WHICH YOU'RE
PLANNING FOR, WHEN?

15:20.440 --> 15:22.703
I MEAN, BAILEY, WE'RE HITTING THE ROAD
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

15:23.043 --> 15:24.625
WELL,
NOT NECESSARILY, WILL.

15:25.235 --> 15:26.533
WE MIGHT NOT
GET THE GIG.

15:26.533 --> 15:27.664
IT'S ALMOST A LOCK.

15:27.664 --> 15:30.798
NOT IF WE BLOW
THE TRYOUT TONIGHT.

15:31.838 --> 15:34.323
NO, BUT YOU BETTER NOT
BLOW THIS ON PURPOSE

15:34.323 --> 15:35.759
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FACE
YOUR OLD MAN.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.155
BAILEY,
I DON'T GET IT.

15:40.155 --> 15:41.765
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS YOUR IDEA.

15:42.345 --> 15:44.551
I KNOW, WILL,
BUT--BUT REALLY.

15:44.551 --> 15:45.900
THINK ABOUT IT.
BEING A ROADIE?

15:46.810 --> 15:50.289
HANGING LIGHTS AND DRAGGING DRUMS
AROUND FOR THESE GUYS? I MEAN...

15:50.949 --> 15:53.081
IT'S NOT EXACTLY MY
LIFE'S DREAM, YOU KNOW?

15:53.081 --> 15:54.909
IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE.

15:54.909 --> 15:57.766
IT'S A WAY TO
GET OUT ON OUR OWN,

15:58.266 --> 16:00.132
TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT WE WANT

16:00.282 --> 16:01.615
THAT MATTERS TO US.

16:03.485 --> 16:04.805
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED.

16:08.569 --> 16:10.751
SEATTLE, CHICAGO, DETROIT.

16:11.651 --> 16:13.841
THEN, FLY BACK
TO MUNICH.

16:14.381 --> 16:15.444
BUT...

16:16.184 --> 16:17.658
WHAT? THAT SOUNDS
INCREDIBLE.

16:17.888 --> 16:19.155
I KNOW.

16:20.065 --> 16:21.369
I KNOW.
I JUST...

16:22.389 --> 16:23.938
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN HOME,

16:23.938 --> 16:25.191
YOU KNOW,
IN ALMOST A YEAR.

16:26.011 --> 16:28.725
I WAS JUST THINKING, WOULD IT BE SUCH
A TERRIBLE THING IF...

16:29.655 --> 16:31.000
YOU KNOW, IF I...

16:31.380 --> 16:32.508
STOPPED.

16:34.188 --> 16:38.138
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? STOPPED RECORDING,
STOPPED TOURING?

16:38.318 --> 16:39.571
STOPPED EVERYTHING.

16:40.911 --> 16:42.261
JUST FOR
A LITTLE WHILE.

16:42.261 --> 16:43.893
JUST FOR
A YEAR OR 2.

16:44.263 --> 16:45.868
CLAUDIA,
A YEAR OR 2?

16:45.898 --> 16:47.648
IT'S JUST A THOUGHT.

16:47.918 --> 16:49.212
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.130
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.359
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE LOVING IT.

16:52.459 --> 16:53.597
I AM.

16:53.687 --> 16:54.788
NO, I AM.

16:54.808 --> 16:58.668
BUT, ROSS, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE I WAS 11 YEARS OLD.

16:59.098 --> 17:01.175
I MEAN, I'VE TRAVELED
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

17:01.205 --> 17:03.935
I'VE PLAYED WITH ALL THESE
AMAZING PEOPLE, BUT...

17:05.645 --> 17:07.070
I MISS MY FAMILY.

17:08.871 --> 17:10.323
IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT...

17:10.593 --> 17:12.247
I MISS DINNERS
AT THE RESTAURANT,

17:12.656 --> 17:13.681
EVERYONE
MAKING FUN OF ME

17:13.711 --> 17:16.040
BECAUSE I ORDER
THE SAME THING EVERY WEEK.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.363
-THE MANICOTTI.
-THE MANICOTTI.

17:18.723 --> 17:20.792
OK, MAYBE IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF SLOWING DOWN.

17:21.213 --> 17:23.065
BUT THEN AGAIN.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.151
MAYBE IT'S JUST
TIME I CAME HOME.

17:28.871 --> 17:30.831
WE CAN HELP YOU,
WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE.

17:30.831 --> 17:33.051
WE CAN PUT YOU WITH COUPLES
WHO WANT TO ADOPT

17:33.051 --> 17:35.732
OR RECOMMEND DOCTORS IF YOU CHOOSE
NOT TO HAVE THE BABY.

17:36.532 --> 17:38.352
THE IMPORTANT THING IS...

17:38.882 --> 17:40.297
DON'T FEEL PRESSURE.

17:41.197 --> 17:42.381
IT'S UP TO YOU.

17:43.191 --> 17:46.383
TAKE THE TIME TO THINK,
TALK TO FRIENDS, AND--

17:48.384 --> 17:49.590
I'M SORRY.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.547
I THOUGHT THE APPOINTMENT WAS
SUPPOSED TO START NOW.

17:52.597 --> 17:54.435
-THIS IS THE FATHER?
-MM-HMM.

17:54.475 --> 17:55.697
DID I MISS IT?

17:57.297 --> 17:59.164
I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT ME TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

17:59.164 --> 18:00.363
NO.

18:00.393 --> 18:01.816
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME,
REALLY.

18:01.906 --> 18:02.958
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GET INTO

18:02.988 --> 18:04.207
THE PARENTS'
RESPONSIBILITIES

18:04.237 --> 18:05.392
WHEN THE BABY'S
CARRIED TO TERM.

18:05.422 --> 18:06.423
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

18:06.433 --> 18:07.458
I CAN JUST TAKE
THESE BROCHURES--

18:07.488 --> 18:08.732
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHEN THE BABY IS...

18:13.983 --> 18:15.452
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT KEEPING IT?

18:15.702 --> 18:18.114
WELL...PUTTING IT
UP FOR ADOPTION.

18:22.531 --> 18:24.152
OK, LOOK, UM...

18:25.712 --> 18:27.136
I'M NOT SURE
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT.

18:27.766 --> 18:29.620
WELL, CHARLIE,
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO RAISE IT.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.016
BUT I MEAN, WHAT IF YOU HAVE IT
AND YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.531
WHAT IF YOU SUDDENLY
DECIDE TO KEEP IT

18:34.561 --> 18:36.114
AND YOU NEED
SOMETHING FROM ME.

18:36.114 --> 18:38.290
I MEAN,
MONEY OR SOMETHING.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.540
YOU'RE PUTTING ME
ON THE HOOK IF YOU DO THIS.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.138
YOU ARE ALREADY
ON THE HOOK.

18:42.798 --> 18:45.134
YOU HAD UNPROTECTED SEX,
AND YOU CONCEIVED.

18:45.144 --> 18:46.305
AND FRANKLY,

18:46.515 --> 18:48.343
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT
OF PATIENCE FOR MEN

18:48.343 --> 18:50.128
WHO NEVER THINK PAST
THEIR NEXT CONQUEST,

18:50.428 --> 18:51.910
WHO THINK THEY CAN
HAVE SEX LIKE THAT

18:51.930 --> 18:53.232
AND JUST BLOW OFF
THE CONSEQUENCES.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.524
LOOK, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME, OK.

18:55.524 --> 18:57.407
WE HAD SEX
THAT WAY TWICE.

18:57.807 --> 18:59.375
AND I'M NOT SOME SORT OF
DEADBEAT DAD HERE,

18:59.395 --> 19:00.747
SO I DON'T NEED
A LECTURE FROM YOU.

19:00.747 --> 19:02.281
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

19:02.531 --> 19:05.708
YOU SHOW UP AN HOUR LATE--
PROBABLY ON PURPOSE--

19:05.708 --> 19:07.452
AND THE SECOND YOU HEAR
YOUR CHILD'S MOTHER

19:07.472 --> 19:08.711
MIGHT NOT WANT TO

OTHER FRIENDS GOING.

25:47.154 --> 25:49.547
IT'S JUST A LOT
OF CASES I SEE,

25:49.547 --> 25:50.809
SOMETIMES
I LOSE OBJECTIVITY,

25:50.809 --> 25:52.407
AND I LET MY OWN ISSUES
GET IN THE WAY.

25:52.437 --> 25:53.458
FORGET IT.

25:53.638 --> 25:55.735
THAT'S FINE.

YOU DON'T, BUT...

26:00.906 --> 26:01.994

26:01.994 --> 26:03.407
WHY? BECAUSE YOU--

26:04.957 --> 26:08.771

"COULD HE RAISE THE CHILD?"

26:25.713 --> 26:26.817

26:33.514 --> 26:35.525
'CAUSE THAT MIGHT
BE NICE SOME DAY...

26:36.195 --> 26:37.682
TO HAVE KIDS.

26:39.512 --> 26:41.594

WHY CAN'T YOU?

26:43.383 --> 26:44.493
THERE'S NO WAY.

26:45.523 --> 26:46.683
WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.043
[SNICKERS]

26:51.043 --> 26:55.832

YOUR PARENTS?

26:58.894 --> 27:00.443
WHO CARES
WHAT THEY THINK?

27:00.813 --> 27:03.055
MINE WANT ME TO MARRY

WHO ASKS.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.220

27:10.540 --> 27:12.412
HOW MUCH DO PARENTS
REALLY KNOW?

27:14.588 --> 27:15.914
THEY KNOW SOMETHIN'.

27:17.354 --> 27:18.681

27:22.775 --> 27:25.641
WOW! MOM DID
SOME REDECORATING.

27:26.121 --> 27:27.775

27:42.189 --> 27:43.400
WELL...

27:43.920 --> 27:45.787
I GUESS THEY REALLY
NEEDED THE SPACE.

27:45.837 --> 27:48.302

YEAH. I JUST--

27:53.470 --> 27:54.889

30:08.256 --> 30:09.601
I HAVE HORRIBLE
HANDWRITING.

30:10.421 --> 30:11.460
PUNISHMENT.

30:11.460 --> 30:12.461
HEH.

30:12.461 --> 30:14.674
YEAH. THAT'S
SOUNDS RIGHT.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.801
SO, UH, YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO THE PARTY TONIGHT,

30:18.851 --> 30:21.253
AND THEN CATCH UP
WITH THE TOUR IN SACRAMENTO?

30:22.447 --> 30:23.777
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

30:24.787 --> 30:26.216
YOU KNOW DAD
WOULD MURDER ME.

30:27.626 --> 30:28.824
SO?

30:29.434 --> 30:33.659
SO...SO WHAT? YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
JUST BE LIKE YOU?

30:34.899 --> 30:36.790
JUST GO TAKE OFF
AND DO WHATEVER I WANT

30:36.790 --> 30:38.104
AND FORGET ABOUT
WHO GETS HURT?

30:41.142 --> 30:42.317
NO.

30:42.317 --> 30:43.564
NOT AT ALL.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.471
NO. WHAT I DID WAS...

30:46.681 --> 30:48.149
WHAT I DID WAS WORSE.

30:48.829 --> 30:50.325
I MEAN, ALL I DID
ALL OF MY LIFE

30:50.325 --> 30:52.023
WAS DO THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT DAD WANTED.

30:52.023 --> 30:54.155
I STILL NEVER MADE ANY
OF MY OWN CHOICES.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.201
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:56.201 --> 30:59.242
I NEVER GOT WHAT I WANTED,
AND NOW DAD AND I HARDLY EVEN TALK.

31:00.602 --> 31:03.382
NO. ALL I'M SAYING IS,
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT,

31:03.382 --> 31:04.900
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT
AND DO THAT.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.309
DON'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

31:06.319 --> 31:07.908
JUST--JUST FIGURE IT OUT...

31:09.388 --> 31:10.774
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

31:19.877 --> 31:20.965
HEY!

31:21.715 --> 31:22.894

AND SOME COFFEE.

31:27.014 --> 31:28.189
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU TAKE IT.

31:28.189 --> 31:29.190

32:44.439 --> 32:47.713

HOW THINGS TURNED OUT.

32:49.143 --> 32:52.247

THAT SHE HAS EVERYTHING THAT SHE NEEDS.

33:07.941 --> 33:09.160
GREAT.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.835
I MEAN, WE DON'T--

33:10.875 --> 33:15.124
THE CLINIC HAS NO POINT
OF VIEW ON YOU TWO STAYING TOGETHER.

33:15.644 --> 33:16.707

33:21.482 --> 33:23.188
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

33:52.807 --> 33:54.065
MMM...

33:54.205 --> 33:55.798
I DECIDED NOT TO.

33:56.598 --> 33:57.939
WHY? BECAUSE OF THEM?

33:57.979 --> 34:00.449
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED?

34:00.469 --> 34:02.011
NO. IT'S JUST...

34:04.824 --> 34:05.954
LOOK AT THEM.

34:06.814 --> 34:08.219
LOOK AT THEM.

34:08.219 --> 34:09.884
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT
THEIR OWN LIVES NOW.

34:10.264 --> 34:11.648
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE
MOVED AWAY FROM HOME.

34:11.688 --> 34:13.862
THEY'VE MOVED AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.965
LIKE MOST FAMILIES.

34:15.965 --> 34:17.626
YEAH, I GUESS.

34:17.706 --> 34:18.922
YEAH.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.523
BUT IN MY HEAD,
IT WAS, UH...

34:22.233 --> 34:24.185
JUST THE WAY IT WAS
WHEN I LEFT, YOU KNOW?

34:25.705 --> 34:27.132
I GUESS I THOUGHT
IF I CAME HOME,

34:27.192 --> 34:28.255
I COULD JUST...

34:28.935 --> 34:30.703
I COULD HAVE THAT BACK,
YOU KNOW?

34:32.501 --> 34:34.107
BUT THAT FAMILY...

34:35.607 --> 34:37.547
THAT FAMILY
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.733
I KNOW. I'M SORRY,

34:45.023 --> 34:48.161
BUT BEFORE YOUR PARENTS GET HERE, I JUST
WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

34:48.911 --> 34:50.962
OH, JUSTIN,
THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

34:51.002 --> 34:52.679
NO. I--I KNOW, AND, UH...

34:52.710 --> 34:54.467
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WANNA
DO THIS TONIGHT,

34:54.507 --> 34:56.181
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE--

34:56.702 --> 34:58.032
MAYBE THIS
WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND.

34:58.072 --> 34:59.388
JUSTIN, NO. I...

34:59.488 --> 35:01.129
WELL, NO. WAIT.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

35:01.149 --> 35:03.053
WE CAN ALWAYS
TAKE IT BACK, OK?

35:05.450 --> 35:06.668
EH...UH...

35:06.668 --> 35:08.217
NO. I--NO.

35:08.347 --> 35:09.507

35:09.627 --> 35:11.401
NO. IT'S--GOD!

35:12.631 --> 35:13.736
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

35:15.823 --> 35:17.220
I CAN'T.

35:18.730 --> 35:20.648
LOOK. IT'S OK.
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

35:20.668 --> 35:22.341
WE CAN TELL THEM
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

35:22.371 --> 35:23.676
NO. I--

35:23.756 --> 35:25.568
OH, GOD, I CAN'T...

35:28.029 --> 35:29.769
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU.

35:30.269 --> 35:31.772
NOT NOW. I CAN'T.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.215
WHAT?

35:37.516 --> 35:38.664
IT'S...

35:39.614 --> 35:40.770
I WANT TO...

35:42.251 --> 35:44.199
I REALLY DO,

35:44.239 --> 35:47.035
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS,

35:47.645 --> 35:48.750
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE...

35:49.550 --> 35:51.240
'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS--
I MEAN, OTHERWISE,

35:51.260 --> 35:54.487
ONE OF US MIGHT GET
SCARED AND DO SOMETHING REALLY STUPID,

35:54.497 --> 35:58.068
AND I WANT US TO DO THIS RIGHT
SO NO ONE GETS HURT.

36:00.983 --> 36:02.231
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

36:02.811 --> 36:03.813
UM...

36:04.823 --> 36:05.970
DO YOU WANNA WAIT?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.029
UH...

YOU WANT TO, UH,
TAKE SOME TIME APART?

THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
I WANNA TAKE TIME APART

36:20.264 --> 36:21.502
FROM THEM.

36:23.382 --> 36:27.096
JUSTIN, I WANT US TO NOT HAVE DINNER
WITH THEM ONCE A WEEK.

36:27.096 --> 36:29.237
I WANNA GO TO TUSCANY
WITH YOU THIS SUMMER

36:29.257 --> 36:31.662
AND BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT A GREAT TIME
WE HAD WITHOUT THEM.

36:34.674 --> 36:36.659
I WANT THIS TO BE
ABOUT US FOR A WHILE.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.337
WELL, WHAT AM I
GONNA DO WITH THIS?

36:53.887 --> 36:55.560
WELL, MAYBE
YOU CAN, UM...

36:57.636 --> 36:59.191
WELL, MAYBE YOU
CAN KEEP IT FOR ME

37:00.191 --> 37:01.786

'CAUSE, UH...

37:03.226 --> 37:04.886
HOPEFULLY,

ABOUT IT,

37:50.009 --> 37:51.877
HE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE

DON'T GO SAYIN', "IF CHARLIE HAD DONE THIS
OR DAD HAD SAID THAT."

38:16.902 --> 38:19.092
OK? 'CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE
NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF.

38:20.862 --> 38:23.503

40:53.490 --> 40:54.628
YOUR CAR WAS GONE.

40:56.148 --> 40:57.845
I HAD AN ACCIDENT.

40:58.673 --> 40:59.934
I CRACKED UP THE JEEP.

IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

41:34.298 --> 41:35.651
IT'S NOT MOM
AND DAD'S FAULT.

41:37.151 --> 41:38.478
