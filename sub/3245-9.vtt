WEBVTT

00:07.132 --> 00:09.510
- What's the emergency?
- It's mauve.

00:09.593 --> 00:10.845
Mauve?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.144
Universally recognised colour for danger.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.233
- What happened to red?
- That's just humans.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.528
By everyone else's standards,
red's camp.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.823
Oh, the misunderstandings.
All those red alerts, all that dancing.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.490
It's got a very basic flight computer
I've hacked in, slaved the Tardis.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.907
Wherever it goes, we go.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.114
- And that's safe, is it?
- Totally.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.454
Okay, reasonably.
Should have said "reasonably" there.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.340
No. No! It's jumping time tracks,
getting away from us.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.755
- What exactly is this thing?
- No idea.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.177
Then why are we chasing it?

00:44.294 --> 00:48.390
It's mauve and dangerous and about
30 seconds from the centre of London.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.440
Know how long you can
knock around space

01:42.519 --> 01:44.146
without happening
to bump into Earth?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.652
Five days.
Or is that when we're out of milk?

01:46.732 --> 01:50.782
Of all the species in all the universe
and it has to come out of a cow.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.367
Must've come down somewhere quite close.
Within a mile anyway.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.829
And it can't have been more than
a few weeks ago. Maybe a month.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.289
A month?
We were right behind it.

02:02.414 --> 02:06.214
It was jumping time tracks all over the place.
We're bound to be a little bit out.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.887
- Do you want to drive?
- Yeah.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.260
- How much is a little?
- A bit.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.725
- Is that exactly a bit?
- Ish.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.678
What's the plan, then?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.980
You going to do a scan
for alien tech or something?

02:18.055 --> 02:22.231
Rose, it hit the middle of London
with a very loud bang. I'm going to ask.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.271
"Dr John Smith, Ministry of Asteroids."

02:25.395 --> 02:27.318
It's psychic paper, it tells you what...

02:27.397 --> 02:30.241
- Whatever you want it to, I remember.
- Sorry.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.321
Not very "Spock", is it?
Just asking.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.989
Door, music, people.
What do you think?

02:36.073 --> 02:38.622
I think you should scan for alien tech.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.712
Give me some Spock, for once.
Would it kill you?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.755
You sure about that T-shirt?

02:45.248 --> 02:48.001
Too early to say.
I'm taking it out for a spin.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.175
Mummy.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.141
Mummy.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.436
Come on if you're coming.
It won't take a minute.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.770
Mummy?

03:09.981 --> 03:13.611
Doctor, there's a kid up there!

03:39.636 --> 03:42.731
♪ For nobody else

03:43.014 --> 03:45.483
♪ Gave me the thrill

03:46.351 --> 03:51.073
♪ When I uphold silence still

03:51.148 --> 03:53.822
♪ 1!' had to be you

03:53.900 --> 03:56.153
♪ Wonderful you ♪

03:57.654 --> 03:59.247
Are you all right up there?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.575
Mummy.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.166
♪ 12' had to be you ♪

04:19.676 --> 04:23.271
Excuse me, could I have
everybody's attention just for a mo?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.686
Be very quick. Hello?

04:25.766 --> 04:29.270
Erm... might seem like a stupid question

04:29.352 --> 04:32.071
but has anything fallen
from the sky recently?

04:53.585 --> 04:54.757
Mummy.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.890
Okay, hang on, don't move.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.069
Sorry, have I said something funny?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.696
It's just there's this thing
that I need to find.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.905
Would have fallen from the sky,
a couple of days ago.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.743
Would have landed
quite near here.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.418
With a very loud...

05:30.580 --> 05:33.333
Quickly as you can,
down to the shelter.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.588
Bang.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.935
Mummy.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.106
Balloon.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.495
Doctor!

06:07.367 --> 06:08.789
Doctor!

06:10.495 --> 06:12.338
Doctor!

06:21.214 --> 06:24.058
Okay. Maybe not this T-shirt.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.733
Rose?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.820
You know, one day.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.576
Just one day, maybe, I'm going
to meet somebody who gets the whole

06:48.658 --> 06:50.501
"don't wander off" thing.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.374
900 years of phone box travel,
it's the only thing left to surprise me.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.065
How can you be ringing?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.859
What's that about ringing?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.737
What am I supposed to do
with a ringing phone?

07:17.854 --> 07:21.028
Don't answer it.
It's not for you.

07:25.904 --> 07:30.205
- And how do you know that?
- 'Cause I do. And I'm telling you.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.036
Don't answer it.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.874
Well, if you know so much,
tell me this, how can it be ringing?

07:37.916 --> 07:41.386
It's not even a real phone,
it's not connected, it's not...

07:54.099 --> 07:55.316
Hello?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.234
This is the Doctor speaking.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.322
- How may I help you?
- Mummy?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.655
Mummy?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.452
Who is this? Who's speaking?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.167
Are you my mummy?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.120
- Who is this?
- Mummy.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.506
How did you ring it? This isn't a
real phone, it's not wired up to...

08:21.584 --> 08:22.836
Mummy?

08:30.677 --> 08:31.929
Rose?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.813
Rose, are you in there?

08:46.776 --> 08:51.077
The planes are coming,
can't you hear them? Into the shelter.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.830
None of your nonsense, now move it.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.126
Come on.
Hurry up, get in there. Come on.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.799
Arthur, will you hurry up?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.468
Didn't you hear the siren?

09:03.543 --> 09:07.047
Middle of dinner, every night.
Blooming Germans, don't they eat?

09:07.130 --> 09:08.848
I can hear the planes.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.308
Don't you eat?

09:10.467 --> 09:13.346
Keep your voice down, will you?
It's an air raid.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.016
Get in, look, there's a war on.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.690
I know there's a war on,
don't push me.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.086
Get those lights out, please.
Everyone down to the shelter.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.381
Jack? You going down to the shelter?

10:23.706 --> 10:26.880
Only I've got to go off
on some damn silly guard duty.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.556
Barrage balloon? Must've come loose.
Happens now and then.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.435
Don't you RAF boys use them
for target practice?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.723
Excellent bottom.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.736
I say, old man,
there's a time and a place.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.239
Look, you should really be off.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.117
Sorry, old man.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.414
I've got to go meet a girl.
But you've got an excellent bottom, too.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.963
- Many kids out there?
- Yes, miss.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.475
Still carving. Sit and wait.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.186
Got the whole air raid.

12:00.303 --> 12:04.183
- Look. Bet it's off the black market.
- That's enough.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.672
- Okay, I got you.
- Who's got me?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.837
Who's got me and how?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.253
I'm just programming
your descent pattern.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.512
Stay as still as you can and keep
your hands and feet inside the light field.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.682
Descent pattern?

12:38.758 --> 12:41.261
And can you switch off your cell phone?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.019
No, seriously,
it interferes with my instruments.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.022
No one ever believes that.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.984
Thank you, that? much better.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.065
Yeah, that's a real load off, that is.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.818
I'm hanging in the sky
in the middle of a German air raid

12:56.901 --> 13:00.531
with a Union jack across my chest but,
hey, my mobile phone's off.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.411
Be with you in a moment.

13:03.950 --> 13:08.751
The mobile device indicates
non-contemporaneous life-form.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.589
She's not from round here, no.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.880
Ready for you. Hold tight.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.303
- To what?
- Fair point.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.441
I got you. You're fine,
you're just fine.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.066
The tractor beam,
it can scramble your head just a little.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.904
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.618
Hello.

13:41.571 --> 13:46.168
Sorry. There was "hello" twice there.
Dull but, you know, thorough.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.578
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.420
Why, you expecting me
to faint or something?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.842
You look a little dizzy.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.636
What about you?
You're not even in focus.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.754
It's got to be black market.
You couldn't get all this on coupons.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.129
Ernie, how many times?
We are guests in this house.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.178
We will not make comments of that kind.
Washing up.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.012
Oh, Nancy.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.717
- Haven't seen you at one of these before.
- He told me about it.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.973
- Sleeping rough?
- Yes, miss.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.139
All right, then.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.852
One slice each. And I want to see
everybody chewing properly.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.569
- Thank you, miss.
- Thanks, miss.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.190
Thank you, miss.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.568
Thanks, miss.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.577
It's all right.
Everybody stay where they are.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.750
Good here, isn't it?
Who's got the salt?

15:08.825 --> 15:11.999
Back in your seats.
He shouldn't be here either.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.836
- So, you lot, what's the story?
- What do you mean?

15:19.919 --> 15:23.890
- You're homeless, right? Living rough?
- Why do you want to know that?

15:24.173 --> 15:25.345
You a Copper?

15:25.425 --> 15:28.599
I'm not a copper. What's a copper
going to do with you lot anyway?

15:28.678 --> 15:30.430
Arrest you for starving?

15:32.682 --> 15:35.185
I make it 1941.
You lot shouldn't even be in London.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.441
Should've been evacuated
to the country by now.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.148
I was evacuated.
Sent me to a farm.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.484
- So why'd you come back?
- There was a man there.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.786
Yeah. Same with Ernie.
Two homes ago.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.365
Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway.
It's better food.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.076
Yeah. Nancy always gets
the best food for us.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.669
- So that's what you do, is it, Nancy?
- What is?

15:53.744 --> 15:57.624
Soon as the sirens go, you find a big,
fat family meal, still warm on the table,

15:57.707 --> 16:00.301
with everyone down
in the air raid shelter and bingo.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.799
Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids
of London town.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.428
Puddings for all, as long as
the bombs don't get you.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.846
- Something wrong with that?
- Wrong? It's brilliant.

16:07.925 --> 16:11.475
I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action
or a West End musical.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.150
Why'd you follow me?
What do you want?

16:16.267 --> 16:19.396
I want to know how a phone
that isn't a phone gets a phone call.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.323
- You seem to be the one to ask.
- I did you a favour.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.026
I told you not to answer it.
That's all I'm telling you.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.079
Great, thanks. And I want to
find a blonde in a Union jack.

16:28.154 --> 16:32.330
I mean, a specific one, I didn't just
wake up this morning with a craving.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.790
Anybody seen a girl like that?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.581
- What have I done wrong?
- You took two slices.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.171
No blondes, no flags.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.885
Anything else before you leave?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.179
There is, actually.
Thanks for asking.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.551
Something I've been looking for.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.384
Would've fallen from the sky
a month ago, but not a bomb.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.890
Not the usual kind anyway.
Wouldn't have exploded.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.643
Probably would've buried itself
in the ground somewhere.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.689
And it would've looked
something like this.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.651
Mummy?
Are you in there, Mummy?

17:07.984 --> 17:09.202
Mummy.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.373
- Who was the last one in?
- Him.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.742
He came round the back.
Who came in the front?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.953
- Me.
- Did you close the door?

17:17.118 --> 17:19.213
Did you close the door?

17:19.454 --> 17:21.799
Mummy. Mummy.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.136
Mummy.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.723
What's this, then?

17:32.843 --> 17:35.938
Never easy being the only
child left out in the cold, you know.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.983
- I suppose you'd know.
- I do, actually, yes.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.652
It's not exactly a child.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.814
Mummy.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.067
Everybody out.
Across the back garden, under the fence.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.618
Now. Go. Move.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.332
Come on, baby, we've got to go.
It's just like a game, just like chasing.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.125
Take your coat. Go on.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.506
Go.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.842
Mummy. Mummy.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.007
Please let me in, Mummy.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.431
Please let me in, Mummy.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.849
You all right?

18:11.966 --> 18:13.593
Please let me in.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.520
You mustn't let him touch you.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.848
What happens if he touches me?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.183
- He makes you like him.
- And what's he like?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.689
- I've got to go.
- Nancy, what's he like?

18:25.688 --> 18:27.110
He's empty-

18:29.442 --> 18:31.365
It's him.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.790
He can make phones ring. He can. just
like with that police box you saw.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.840
Are you my mummy?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.135
Mummy?

18:49.003 --> 18:50.550
Mummy?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.391
Please let me in, Mummy.

18:54.216 --> 18:58.221
Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.356
You stay here if you want to.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.226
Mummy. Mummy. Mummy...

19:03.351 --> 19:05.570
Mummy.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.356
Let me in, please, Mummy.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.402
- Please let me in.
- Your mummy isn't here.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.206
- Are you my mummy?
- No mummies here.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.746
Nobody here but us chickens.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.662
Well. This chicken.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.247
I'm scared.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.169
Why are those other children
frightened of you?

19:29.251 --> 19:32.596
Please let me in, Mummy.
I'm scared of the bombs.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.221
Okay. I'm opening the door now.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.804
- Better now?
- You got lights in here?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.143
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.560
Hello.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.936
- Let's not start that again.
- Okay.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.605
So, who are you supposed be, then?

20:30.771 --> 20:35.242
Captain Jack Harkness,
133 Squadron, Royal Air Force.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.241
American volunteer.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.907
Liar. This is psychic paper.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.992
It tells me whatever
you want it to tell me.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.494
- How do you know?
- Two things.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.672
One, I have a friend
that uses this all the time

20:47.747 --> 20:52.253
and two, you just handed me
a piece of paper telling me you're single

20:52.334 --> 20:53.677
and you work out.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.592
- Tricky thing, psychic paper.
- Yeah.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.845
Can't let your mind wander
when you're handing it over.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.933
You sort of have a boyfriend
called Mickey Smith

21:03.012 --> 21:06.266
but you consider yourself
to be footloose and fancy free.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.648
- What?
- Actually the word you use is "available".

21:09.769 --> 21:12.272
- No way.
- And another one, "very".

21:12.354 --> 21:15.198
Shall we try and get along
without the psychic paper?

21:15.316 --> 21:17.535
That would be better, wouldn't it?

21:19.612 --> 21:22.331
- Nice spaceship.
- Gets me around.

21:23.157 --> 21:26.457
Very... Spock.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.541
Who?

21:28.662 --> 21:31.040
Guessing you're not a local boy, then?

21:32.333 --> 21:36.383
A cell phone, a liquid crystal watch
and fabrics that won't be around

21:36.462 --> 21:38.464
for at least another two decades.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.551
- Guessing you're not a local girl.
- Guessing right.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.643
- Burn your hands on the rope?
- Yeah.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.314
We're parked in midair.
Can't anyone down there see us?

21:50.392 --> 21:53.692
No. Can I have a look at your hands
for a moment?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.031
- Why?
- Please.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.414
You can stop acting now.
I know exactly who you are.

22:08.244 --> 22:12.044
- I can spot a Time Agent a mile away.
- A Time Agent?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.418
I've been expecting
one of you guys to show up.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.928
Though not, I must to say,
by barrage balloon.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.672
Do you often travel that way?

22:19.755 --> 22:22.224
Sometimes I get
swept off my feet.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.185
By balloons.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.064
- What are you doing?
- Try to keep still.

22:35.229 --> 22:40.076
Nanogenes, subatomic robots.
The air in here is full of them.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.619
They just repaired
three layers of your skin.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.952
Tell them thanks.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.629
- Shall we get down to business?
- Business?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.799
Shall we have a drink on the balcony?

22:58.252 --> 22:59.879
Bring up the glasses.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.773
I know I'm standing on something.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.996
- Okay. You have an invisible spaceship.
- Yeah.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.503
Tethered up to Big Ben for some reason.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.800
First rule of active camouflage.
Park somewhere you'll remember.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.310
How'd you follow me here?

24:30.386 --> 24:32.889
I'm good at following, me.
I've got the nose for it.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.482
People can't usually follow me
if I don't want them to.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.061
- My nose has special powers.
- Yeah? Is that why it's so...

24:39.353 --> 24:40.900
- What?
- Nothing.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.739
- What?
- Nothing.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.994
- Your ears have special powers, too?
- What are you trying to say?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.571
Good night, mister.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.243
Nancy.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.159
There's something chasing you
and the other kids.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.994
It looks like a boy
and it isn't a boy.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.580
And it started about a month ago. Right?

24:59.164 --> 25:01.007
The thing I'm looking for.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.087
The thing that fell from the sky.
That's when it landed.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.179
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

25:06.255 --> 25:09.350
There was a bomb.
A bomb that wasn't a bomb.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.931
Fell the other end
of Limehouse Green Station.

25:12.052 --> 25:16.057
- Take me there.
- No. Soldiers guarding it. Barbed wire.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.692
- You'd never get through.
- Try me.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.111
You sure you want to know
what's going on in there?

25:21.186 --> 25:22.779
I really want to know.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.033
Then there's someone
you need to talk to first.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.907
- And who might that be?
- The Doctor.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.286
It's getting a bit late.
I should really be getting back.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.961
We're discussing business.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.211
This isn't business,
this is champagne.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.881
I try never to discuss business
with a clear head.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.806
Are you travelling alone?

25:50.799 --> 25:54.804
- Are you authorised to negotiate?
- What would we be negotiating?

25:56.305 --> 25:59.809
I have something for the Time Agency.
Something they'd like to buy.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.152
Are you empowered
to make payment?

26:02.811 --> 26:06.406
Well, I should talk to my companion.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.326
- Your companion?
- I should really be getting back to him.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.620
- Him?
- Do you have the time?

26:18.494 --> 26:20.121
Okay. That was flash.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.256
That was on the flash side.

26:23.332 --> 26:27.633
So, when you say
your companion...

26:27.753 --> 26:29.676
just how disappointed should I be?

26:29.797 --> 26:32.346
- Okay, we're standing in midair...
- Uh-huh.

26:32.466 --> 26:36.596
On a spaceship,
during a German air raid.

26:37.638 --> 26:41.017
Do you really think now's a good time
to be coming on to me?

26:42.684 --> 26:43.856
Perhaps not.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.446
It was just a suggestion.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.698
Do you like Glenn Miller?

26:59.868 --> 27:03.668
It's 1941. The height of the London Blitz.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.383
The height of
the German bombing campaign.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.003
And something else
has fallen on London.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.964
A fully equipped Chula warship.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.223
The last one in existence
armed to the teeth.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.482
And I know where it is
because I parked it.

27:24.393 --> 27:28.819
If the agency can name the right price,
I can get it for you.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.571
But in two hours...

27:32.818 --> 27:36.243
a German bomb is going to fall on it
and destroy it forever.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.159
That's your deadline.
That's the deal.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.416
Now, shall we discuss payment?

27:43.537 --> 27:45.505
- You know what I think?
- What?

27:46.039 --> 27:48.337
I think you were talking just there.

27:48.876 --> 27:53.006
Two hours. The bomb falls. There'll be
nothing left but dust and a crater.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.515
Promises, promises.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.763
Are you listening to any of this?

27:57.176 --> 28:01.022
You used to be a Time Agent,
now you're some kind of freelancer.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.020
It's a little harsh.
I like to think of myself as a criminal.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.567
I'll bet you do.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.356
So this companion of yours,
does he handle the business?

28:10.898 --> 28:13.697
Well, I delegate a lot of that, yeah.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.777
Maybe we should go find him.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.616
- And how you going to do that?
- Easy, I'll do a scan for alien tech.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.205
Finally a professional.

28:37.466 --> 28:41.642
The bomb's under the tarpaulin.
They put the fence up overnight.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.398
See that building?
The hospital?

28:46.725 --> 28:49.774
- What about it?
- That's where the Doctor is.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.826
You should talk to him.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.404
For now,
I'm more interested in getting in there.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.240
- Talk to the Doctor first.
- Why?

29:01.615 --> 29:04.494
Because then maybe
you won't want to get inside.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.085
Where you going?

29:10.832 --> 29:14.462
There was a lot of food in that house.
I've got mouths to feed.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.429
Should be safe enough now.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.674
Can I ask you a question?

29:19.591 --> 29:22.515
- Who did you lose?
- What?

29:25.514 --> 29:30.111
The way you look after all those kids.
It's 'cause you lost somebody, isn't it?

29:31.311 --> 29:33.814
You're doing all this to make up for it.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.865
My little brother. Jamie.

29:41.196 --> 29:45.042
One night I went out looking for food.
Same night that thing fell.

29:45.617 --> 29:49.622
Told him not to follow me.
I told him it was dangerous. But he just...

29:50.956 --> 29:53.300
He just didn't like being on his own.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.718
What happened?

29:55.210 --> 29:59.056
In the middle of an air raid?
What do you think happened?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.055
- Amazing.
- What is?

30:06.847 --> 30:11.899
1941. Right now, not very far from here

30:12.019 --> 30:15.068
the German war machine
is rolling up the map of Europe.

30:15.188 --> 30:19.409
Country after country, falling like dominoes.
Nothing can stop it, nothing.

30:20.652 --> 30:24.031
Until one tiny, damp,
little island says "no".

30:25.324 --> 30:27.747
No, not here.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.589
A mouse in front of a lion.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.716
You're amazing.
The lot of you.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.761
Don't know what you do to Hitler,
but you frighten the hell out of me.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.729
Off you go, then. Do what you got to do.
Save the world.

32:41.209 --> 32:45.180
You'll find them everywhere.
In every bed, in every ward.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.719
Hundreds of them.

32:46.840 --> 32:50.140
Yes, I saw.
Why are they still wearing gas masks?

32:50.218 --> 32:52.721
- They're not. Who are you?
- I'm...

32:53.180 --> 32:57.151
- Are you the Doctor?
- Dr Constantine. And you are?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.811
- Nancy sent me.
- Nancy?

33:00.896 --> 33:03.490
That means you must have been
asking about the bomb.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.737
Yes.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.819
What do you know about it?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.577
Nothing. Why I was asking.
What do you know?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.533
Only what it's done.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.831
These people were all caught up
in the blast?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.379
None of them were.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.508
You're very sick.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.433
Dying, I should think.
I just haven't been able to find the time.

33:30.550 --> 33:33.394
- Are you a doctor?
- I have my moments.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.101
- Have you examined any of them yet?
- No.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.100
Don't touch the flesh.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.194
- Which one?
- Any one.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.445
Conclusions?

33:49.569 --> 33:52.038
Massive head trauma,
mostly to the left side.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.957
Partial collapse of the chest cavity,
mostly to the right.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.952
There's scarring on
the back of the hand

33:57.077 --> 34:00.456
and the gas mask seems to be fused to
the ﬂesh, but I can't see any burns.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.041
Examine another one.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.980
- This is impossible.
- Examine another.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.899
- This is impossible.
- No.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.822
- They've all got the same injuries.
- Yes.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.907
- Exactly the same.
- Yes.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.987
Identical, all of them, right down
to the scar on the back of the hand.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.409
How did this happen?
How did it start?

34:34.489 --> 34:36.911
When that bomb dropped,
there was just one victim.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.666
- Dead?
- At first.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.289
His injuries were truly dreadful.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.760
By the following morning every doctor
and nurse who had treated him,

34:46.835 --> 34:51.431
who had touched him,
had those exact same injuries.

34:51.505 --> 34:56.603
By the next morning, every patient
on the same ward, the exact same injuries.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.272
Within a week,
the entire hospital.

35:00.181 --> 35:04.027
Physical injuries as plague.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.696
Can you explain that?

35:08.315 --> 35:11.694
What would you say
was the cause of death?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.362
- The head trauma.
- No.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.204
- Asphyxiation?
- No.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.870
- The collapse of the chest cavity.
- No.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.460
All right,
what was the cause of death?

35:22.037 --> 35:23.505
There wasn't one.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.340
They're not dead.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.475
It's all right,
they are harmless.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.895
They just sort of sit there.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.395
No heartbeat.
No life signs of any kind.

35:43.016 --> 35:46.395
They just don't die.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.899
And they've just been left here.
Nobody's doing anything?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.902
I try and make them comfortable.
What else is there?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.827
Just you?
You're the only one here.

35:54.903 --> 35:58.658
Before this war began
I was a father and a grandfather.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.244
Now I'm neither.
But I'm still a doctor.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.588
Yeah. I know the feeling.

36:05.705 --> 36:10.085
I suspect the plan is to blow up the
hospital and blame it on a German bomb.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.429
- Probably too late.
- I know.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.848
There are isolated cases.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.267
Isolated cases breaking out
all over London.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.772
Stay back.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.071
Listen to me. Top floor.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.113
Room 802.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.693
That's where they took the first victim.
The one from the crash site.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.370
- And you must find Nancy again.
- Nancy?

36:37.445 --> 36:38.947
It was her brother.

36:39.781 --> 36:43.877
She knows more than she's saying.
She won't tell me, but she...

36:49.958 --> 36:52.552
Mummy.

36:55.463 --> 36:59.559
Are you my...

36:59.634 --> 37:02.103
mummy?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.961
Hello?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.178
Hello?

37:36.296 --> 37:37.843
Hello?

37:41.843 --> 37:43.937
Good evening.
Hope we're not interrupting.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.936
Jack Harkness. I've been hearing
all about you on the way over.

37:47.015 --> 37:50.690
He knows, I had to tell him.
About us being Time Agents.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.114
And it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Mr Spock.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.285
Mr Spock?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.783
What was I supposed to say?
You don't have a name.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.207
Don't you ever get tired of "Doctor"?
Doctor who?

38:04.324 --> 38:06.622
Nine centuries in, I'm coping.
Where've you been?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.796
We're in the middle of a London Blitz,
not the time for a stroll.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.374
Who's strolling?
I went by barrage balloon.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.877
- Only way to see an air raid.
- What?

38:15.001 --> 38:17.129
Listen, what's a Chula warship?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.049
Chula?

38:26.387 --> 38:28.981
Please, Mummy.
Please let me in.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.526
I'm scared of the bombs, Mummy.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.228
Please, Mummy.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.490
Mummy.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.576
Mummy.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.926
This just isn't possible.
How did this happen?

39:01.172 --> 39:03.425
- What kind of Chula ship landed here?
- What?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.010
He said it was a warship.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.266
He stole it,
parked it somewhere out there.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.599
Somewhere a bomb's gonna fall on it.
Unless we make him an offer.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.026
- What kind of warship?
- Does it matter?

39:13.101 --> 39:14.444
It has nothing to do with this.

39:14.561 --> 39:18.111
This started at the bomb site.
It's got everything to do with it.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.442
- What kind of warship?
- An ambulance.

39:22.527 --> 39:26.452
Look. That's what you chased
through the time vortex.

39:26.906 --> 39:31.252
It's space junk, I wanted to kid you
it was valuable, it's empty.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.789
I made sure of it,
nothing but a shell.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.294
I threw it at you.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.547
Saw your time travel vehicle,
love the retro look by the way,

39:38.626 --> 39:41.470
- nice panels, threw you the bait...
- Bait?

39:41.963 --> 39:45.638
I wanted to sell it to you, then destroy it
before you found it was junk.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.096
- You said it was a warship.
- They have ambulances in wars.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.479
It's a con. I was conning you.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.904
That's what I am, I'm a con man.
Thought you were Time Agents.

39:57.979 --> 40:01.074
- You're not, are you?
- Just a couple more freelancers.

40:01.149 --> 40:05.575
Oh! Should've known, the way you guys
are blending in with the local colour.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.497
Flag Girl was bad enough,
but U-boat Captain?

40:09.574 --> 40:14.421
Anyway, whatever's happening here
has got nothing to do with that ship.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.918
What is happening here, Doctor?

40:18.082 --> 40:20.335
Human DNA is being rewritten.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.008
- By an idiot.
- What do you mean?

40:23.129 --> 40:26.929
I don't know, some kind of virus.
Converting humans into these things.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.852
But why? What's the point?

40:33.181 --> 40:34.353
Mummy.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.859
Where's my mummy?

40:41.189 --> 40:42.441
Mummy.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.302
Are you my mummy?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.401
Mummy.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.816
Mummy.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.818
Mummy.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.525
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.074
Mummy.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.751
It's me. Nancy.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.333
Don't let them touch you.

41:38.413 --> 41:41.587
- What happens if they touch us?
- You're looking at it.

41:43.584 --> 41:47.760
- Are you my mummy?
- It's Nancy, your sister.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.936
You're dead, Jamie.
You're dead.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.097
Mummy.

41:56.597 --> 41:59.191
Mummy.

41:59.267 --> 42:01.895
Mummy. Mummy...

42:02.854 --> 42:05.949
- Mummy.
- Mummy.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.200
Mummy...

42:52.487 --> 42:55.411
I don't know what's happening
but I had nothing to do with it.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.833
I'll tell you what's happening.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.912
You forgot to set your alarm clock.
It's Volcano Day.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.501
That door should hold it for a bit.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.799
The door?
The wall didn't stop it.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.759
Halt. Don't move.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.757
Go on, ask me anything, I'm on fire.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.089
You've got the moves,
show me your moves.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.595
The world doesn't end
'cause the Doctor dances.

43:13.674 --> 43:14.926
Stay back.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.349
Mummy.

43:18.012 --> 43:19.605
- Doctor.
- Secure those gates.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.148
- Why?
- Just do it.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.439
All that weapons tech in the hands
of an hysterical four-year-old

43:24.519 --> 43:25.941
looking for his mummy.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.364
And nothing in
the world can stop it.
