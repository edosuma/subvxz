00:02.114 --> 00:05.387
LASZLO: Previously
on this documentary...

00:05.420 --> 00:06.757
Colin Robinson is dying.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.262
-(Nadja gasps)
-(groans)

00:09.295 --> 00:10.532
NADJA:
I will be returning to England

00:10.565 --> 00:12.101
to assume a position on the

00:12.134 --> 00:13.604
Supreme Vampiric Council.

00:13.638 --> 00:17.077
Will you do me the honor
of accompanying me on my journey

00:17.111 --> 00:18.748
around the world?

00:18.781 --> 00:21.587
-Make sure
you look after my wife.
-What? Aah! No!

00:21.620 --> 00:24.425
LASZLO: There are, it seems,
others in our world

00:24.458 --> 00:26.797
whose existence
is even more terrifying

00:26.830 --> 00:29.235
and mysterious than our own.

00:29.268 --> 00:30.470
Shit.

00:33.476 --> 00:35.548
-(lightning crashes)
-(thunder rumbling)

00:55.655 --> 00:57.626
-(cawing)
-(cameraman gasps)

00:59.262 --> 01:02.067
TOBY (on TV):
Josh and Elana wanted
an open concept,

01:02.101 --> 01:04.071
so we suggested taking down

01:04.105 --> 01:06.175
the wall dividing the kitchen
and dining room

01:06.209 --> 01:08.614
and using a terra-cotta
backsplash to unify the space...

01:08.648 --> 01:11.085
LASZLO:
Terra-cotta backsplash would
make a great accent.

01:11.119 --> 01:14.091
What he hasn't mentioned is that
that's a load-bearing wall.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.795
...this was
a low-bearing wall...

01:15.828 --> 01:17.464
LASZLO:
Oh, I've spoken too soon.

01:17.499 --> 01:19.302
Apologies to you, Bran.

01:19.335 --> 01:22.241
What the... Ah.

01:22.274 --> 01:24.813
Hello there. Long time no see.

01:24.846 --> 01:27.852
-Come on in, but keep it down.
-Okay.

01:27.886 --> 01:30.424
I've found that
this is the only thing

01:30.457 --> 01:32.261
that'll lull him to sleep.

01:32.294 --> 01:35.768
Since Nadja and Nandor departed,
it's been just me and the lad.

01:35.802 --> 01:37.338
I don't want to call him
Colin Robinson,

01:37.371 --> 01:39.408
even though he did crawl out of

01:39.442 --> 01:41.513
the chest cavity of
the deceased Colin Robinson.

01:41.547 --> 01:43.316
He really is his own little man,

01:43.350 --> 01:45.320
and I'd like
to keep it that way.

01:45.354 --> 01:46.857
So, I just call him boy.

01:46.890 --> 01:49.529
He's been growing
at a remarkable rate,

01:49.563 --> 01:51.600
and he's a wild little creature,

01:51.634 --> 01:53.336
full of mischief and surprises.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.209
-(whoops)
-Shit. There we are. Good boy.

01:56.242 --> 01:58.614
And not a bit the boring,
energy-draining Colin Robinson

01:58.648 --> 02:00.283
from whence he came.

02:00.317 --> 02:02.555
He's a good little helper.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.458
Boy, I'm gonna need one nail.

02:04.493 --> 02:06.296
-(giggles)
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:06.329 --> 02:08.300
Yeah. All right.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.836
Helping me maintain this house.

02:09.870 --> 02:10.872
One.

02:10.905 --> 02:12.308
Which, I'm sure you've noticed,

02:12.341 --> 02:13.778
has seen better days.

02:13.811 --> 02:16.617
He's given me
a sense of purpose.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.556
And under my tutelage,
with exposure to woodcraft,

02:19.589 --> 02:21.225
scintillating conversation...

02:21.259 --> 02:23.463
-Good work, boy.
-...high culture...

02:23.497 --> 02:25.635
-En garde.
-...and, of course,
swordsmanship...

02:25.668 --> 02:27.204
-Ha. (giggles)
-Shit.

02:27.237 --> 02:28.273
-(laughing)
-Ah, you're getting better.

02:28.306 --> 02:29.509
...I think I can mold

02:29.543 --> 02:31.580
this blank canvas of a boy

02:31.613 --> 02:35.487
into the most interesting adult
there has ever been.

03:14.533 --> 03:17.337
It's those bastards
from the gas company.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.841
Yes, there's a gas leak.

03:18.874 --> 03:21.279
Yes, I need to do
something about it.

03:21.312 --> 03:23.684
Yes, if you turn up again,
I'm gonna kill you.

03:23.718 --> 03:25.988
-(doorbell rings)
-All right, all right.

03:26.022 --> 03:28.761
All these wooden boxes and shit
have been arriving

03:28.794 --> 03:30.598
for my wife for weeks.

03:30.631 --> 03:32.367
I do mean to send them on
to London,

03:32.401 --> 03:35.942
but I've been too busy
murdering these gas employees

03:35.975 --> 03:38.981
that they insist
on sending round.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.488
-(thunder rumbles)
-(singsongy): Guess who.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.926
Where the hell
did you come from?

03:44.960 --> 03:47.532
Well, I had a little help.

03:47.565 --> 03:50.772
-Surprise!
-My darling!

03:50.805 --> 03:52.509
-Oh, my love.
-Every day of your absence

03:52.542 --> 03:53.944
-Oh, I've missed you so much.
-has felt like a decade.

03:53.978 --> 03:55.948
Every decade, a century.
Let's fuck.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.484
These guys are still alive?

03:57.519 --> 03:59.255
-(laughs)
-Yeah, yeah, doesn't matter.

03:59.288 --> 04:00.691
Don't you want to know
why I've returned from London?

04:00.725 --> 04:02.862
Yeah, you can tell me later.
It'll wait.

04:02.896 --> 04:06.002
My work with the Worldwide
Supreme Vampiric Council was

04:06.035 --> 04:09.442
so challenging
but also fulfilling, you know?

04:09.475 --> 04:10.711
-Yeah.
-And... and I gave it all up.

04:10.745 --> 04:12.347
I had to,

04:12.381 --> 04:14.385
because I missed you so much.

04:14.418 --> 04:18.326
-My wide lover.
-Your wise mov... (giggles)

04:18.359 --> 04:21.432
-(groans)
-You are a naughty bloody boy.

04:21.466 --> 04:23.269
You were supposed
to come with me to London,

04:23.303 --> 04:25.575
but you just packed me up
and shipped me off.

04:25.608 --> 04:26.977
My darling,
I had to look after the boy.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.681
-I wrote to you.
-Yes, yes,

04:28.714 --> 04:30.885
about creature that crawled out
of the cavity of

04:30.918 --> 04:34.291
dead Colin Robinson's chest.
I understand, I guess.

04:34.325 --> 04:36.362
Speak of the devil.

04:36.395 --> 04:38.333
Hello. Is that you, little one?

04:38.366 --> 04:39.401
-Mommy's home.
-That's not him.

04:39.435 --> 04:40.671
Are you sure?

04:40.705 --> 04:42.675
Yes, that's a raccoon,
my darling.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.679
-(raccoon chittering)
-They've taken residence
in the library.

04:44.713 --> 04:47.785
-Oh.
-The boy himself
is upstairs, asleep.

04:47.819 --> 04:49.488
Well, perfect, then.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.927
-Yeah.
-I want to peel you
like a potato

04:51.960 --> 04:53.564
and mash your insides.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.933
-Come on.
-Okay.

04:54.966 --> 04:56.469
-Watch your step, my darling.
-(giggles)

04:56.503 --> 04:58.406
The water damage
has ruined the wood.

04:58.439 --> 05:00.343
-Not this wood.
-(laughs)

05:00.377 --> 05:01.880
Shit, I almost forgot.

05:01.914 --> 05:03.383
Before we go upstairs,

05:03.416 --> 05:06.355
I have a little surprise
for you.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.026
-It'll wait.
-(whistles)

05:08.059 --> 05:09.796
Come on!

05:09.830 --> 05:13.838
Wassup...!

05:18.379 --> 05:21.587
Uh, it is a saying
from the olden days

05:21.620 --> 05:22.856
that I learned on my travels.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.759
I don't know what it means,

05:24.793 --> 05:26.630
but I like how it sounds.

05:26.663 --> 05:28.567
Yeah, well, it's a great story.

05:28.601 --> 05:30.003
-Thank you.
-LASZLO: But, uh,

05:30.036 --> 05:31.339
darling, "why haven't
we finished fucking?",

05:31.372 --> 05:32.609
you might ask yourself.

05:32.642 --> 05:34.044
Well, the answer is

05:34.078 --> 05:36.048
it's 'cause we haven't
managed to start yet.

05:36.082 --> 05:38.353
-Do excuse us.
-(Nadja giggles)
-Laszlo.

05:38.386 --> 05:41.392
I know you're not
a sentimental fellow,

05:41.425 --> 05:42.962
and neither am I,

05:42.996 --> 05:45.501
-but I have missed you.
-Aw.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.539
And it feels really good
to be back in the house!

05:47.572 --> 05:48.774
-Shit.
-Fucking hell.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.943
-LASZLO: Is he dead? Huh?
-I'm okay!

05:49.976 --> 05:52.114
-LASZLO: No?
-I'm okay.

05:52.147 --> 05:54.719
There's a very strong smell
of gas leak down here.

05:54.753 --> 05:58.961
-(sniffs)
-Could someone throw me down
a lit candle,

05:58.994 --> 06:00.698
and I can find my way out?

06:07.512 --> 06:09.381
-(lightning crashes)
-(thunder rumbling)

06:10.417 --> 06:12.789
My eat, prey, love journey?

06:12.822 --> 06:14.058
Where to begin?

06:15.193 --> 06:17.732
As fate would have it,
I got as far as...

06:17.765 --> 06:20.103
Fresno, I think it is called.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.813
I met a very plump family
on the train

06:24.846 --> 06:25.948
from Wisconsin.

06:25.982 --> 06:27.484
I planned to drain them,

06:27.518 --> 06:29.756
but they were quite endearing.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.860
They had a very particular
way of speaking,

06:31.894 --> 06:33.463
It was like, um...

06:33.497 --> 06:35.801
(American accent):
"Oh, hey there, Nandor.

06:35.835 --> 06:37.939
"You want to come see
the Packers pound

06:37.972 --> 06:41.546
the frozen tundra
of the Lambeau Field?"

06:41.580 --> 06:43.149
(regular accent):
Something like that.

06:44.151 --> 06:47.959
The love and the affection that
this family had for each other,

06:47.992 --> 06:50.463
it made me miss my own family.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.169
I grew homesick,
not for Staten Island

06:53.202 --> 06:56.576
but my real home in Al Qolnidar.

06:56.610 --> 06:59.014
So I booked passage
on a container ship

06:59.048 --> 07:01.218
to...

07:01.252 --> 07:03.089
-(Laszlo and Nadja moaning)
-I kind of get the idea

07:03.122 --> 07:04.893
that you guys aren't really
listening to what I'm saying.

07:04.926 --> 07:06.462
-NADJA: We're listening.
-Yeah, I mean,

07:06.496 --> 07:07.932
I'm capable of doing
two things at once.

07:07.966 --> 07:09.970
-NADJA: Faster. (moans)
-LASZLO: Go on.

07:10.003 --> 07:11.640
Something about
a container ship.

07:11.673 --> 07:13.042
-NADJA: Mm-hmm.
-Anyway, so,

07:13.076 --> 07:15.013
I hitched a ride on a ship,

07:15.046 --> 07:16.482
and after I'd drained
all of the crew,

07:16.516 --> 07:18.219
we ran into a little delay.

07:18.252 --> 07:19.956
NEWSMAN:
A traffic jam on one of

07:19.990 --> 07:21.593
the most important waterways
in the world.

07:21.627 --> 07:23.530
The Suez Canal
was blocked on Tuesday

07:23.564 --> 07:25.200
when a very large
container carrier got s...

07:25.233 --> 07:28.707
Finally, I found my way back
to Al Qolnidar.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.010
-My h...
-(giggling)

07:30.043 --> 07:31.546
Oh, wow.

07:31.580 --> 07:35.153
-Look at you.
-Hello, darling.

07:35.186 --> 07:37.692
That was the baby
Colin Robinson, I assume?

07:37.725 --> 07:40.798
No. That came from the body
of Colin Robinson,

07:40.831 --> 07:42.602
but is something completely
different entirely.

07:42.635 --> 07:44.839
Is it boring
like Colin Robinson?

07:44.873 --> 07:48.514
-Well, now that
is an excellent question.
-Thank you.

07:48.547 --> 07:50.150
One that I have been
vigorously applying

07:50.183 --> 07:52.655
my scientific method to
for the past two months.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.260
My work began with
experiments in isolation.

07:55.293 --> 07:58.199
-(buzzes)
-I dabbled in phrenology.

07:58.232 --> 08:00.738
Disappointed. Shocked.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.909
Happy. Puzzled.

08:02.942 --> 08:04.278
Fortifying good judgment.

08:04.311 --> 08:07.919
Important literature
or colorful shit.

08:07.952 --> 08:10.223
-Um...
-Make your choice.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.094
-No!
-(crackling)

08:12.127 --> 08:13.697
-(giggles)
-And, of course,
electroshock therapy.

08:13.731 --> 08:15.568
Again.

08:15.601 --> 08:19.074
I subjected him to all manner
of boring imagery.

08:19.108 --> 08:21.278
He found it just as tedious
as I did.

08:21.312 --> 08:25.020
I am delighted to report that
he is not and will not grow into

08:25.053 --> 08:28.660
the boring energy vampire
from whence he came.

08:28.694 --> 08:29.996
Rubbish.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.633
Only today, I was

08:31.666 --> 08:32.735
conducting a new experiment...

08:32.769 --> 08:34.171
Are you two having sex again?

08:34.204 --> 08:36.643
Well, I'm not
baking a cake, Nandor.

08:36.676 --> 08:38.212
NADJA:
It would be so much
more enjoyable

08:38.246 --> 08:40.751
if you would stop interrupting.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.588
-Or you could join in, old chap.
-NADJA: Come on.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.124
Room in the back.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.095
I'm tempted, but, uh,
I'll leave you guys to it

08:46.128 --> 08:47.999
-and just watch,
if that's all right.
-LASZLO: Okay.

08:48.032 --> 08:49.869
Yes, I'm cl...
I'm really close.

08:49.903 --> 08:51.205
LASZLO:
You might have to
calm this down, my darling.

08:51.238 --> 08:53.276
I'm not sure
this settee can take it.

08:53.309 --> 08:56.315
-This settee has taken
centuries of our love.
-(Laszlo moans)

08:56.348 --> 08:58.319
-(Nadja and Laszlo scream)
-(clattering)

08:58.352 --> 09:00.156
-(water splashes)
-NADJA: Whoa.
-(Laszlo laughs)

09:00.190 --> 09:01.626
NANDOR:
Are you okay?

09:01.660 --> 09:03.697
You want me to
throw you down a candle?

09:03.731 --> 09:07.337
-LASZLO: Fuck me. (laughs)
-Okay, here I go.

09:07.370 --> 09:09.609
-(Nadja grunting)
-They're at it again.

09:09.642 --> 09:12.314
Are you doing a role play
or are you really drowning?

09:12.347 --> 09:14.853
Drowning, my darling.
It's hot, yeah?

09:14.886 --> 09:17.090
-(rumbling)
-Listen to this place.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.061
It sounds like the entire house
is going to collapse

09:19.094 --> 09:21.332
-at any moment. Ay! Ay! The f...
-Careful, old chap.

09:21.365 --> 09:23.871
-There's a hole there.
-(loud pounding)

09:23.904 --> 09:25.674
What is that thumping?

09:25.708 --> 09:27.077
It's just bad pipes. It'll pass.

09:27.110 --> 09:29.181
I had to take
a sledgehammer to that wall,

09:29.214 --> 09:32.020
-that wall and that wall
down there.
-(Nandor groans)

09:32.053 --> 09:35.594
-Oh.
-I tried to find the culprit,
but so far, no luck.

09:35.628 --> 09:37.097
We are running out of rooms
to sit in

09:37.130 --> 09:39.334
that aren't completely
falling apart.

09:39.368 --> 09:41.807
-It's true.
-I do wish Guillermo
was still here.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.944
At least he kept the house
tidy and shipshape.

09:43.977 --> 09:45.280
Who's he talking about?

09:45.313 --> 09:46.817
-NANDOR: Guillermo.
-LASZLO: Who?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.352
You know, Guillermo.

09:48.386 --> 09:49.956
Doesn't matter how many times
you keep saying it.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.227
He's about this tall,
glasses, shitty sweater.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.231
Nadja, I think it's time.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.770
Oh! That reminds me.

09:56.803 --> 09:59.809
I have got a teensy
little present for you both.

09:59.843 --> 10:00.878
-Oh.
-NANDOR: Oh.
-NADJA: Now...

10:00.911 --> 10:02.080
Okay, don't get too excited.

10:02.114 --> 10:03.316
It's not that good.

10:03.349 --> 10:04.786
NANDOR:
Should I cover my eyes?

10:04.819 --> 10:05.988
-I love surprises.
-NADJA: Okay...

10:06.021 --> 10:07.157
Ta-da!

10:07.190 --> 10:08.827
(gasping)

10:08.861 --> 10:10.230
NADJA:
Surprise!

10:10.263 --> 10:11.633
-LASZLO: Oh, that guy.
-NANDOR: Guillermo.

10:11.666 --> 10:13.169
-Oh.
-LASZLO: Right.

10:13.202 --> 10:14.839
(panting)

10:14.873 --> 10:17.110
How could you ship me
across the Atlantic

10:17.144 --> 10:19.782
in a wooden crate?
Twice!

10:19.816 --> 10:21.887
Always a complaint
with this one.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.059
I packed you extra Oreos
and Pedialyte this time around,

10:25.093 --> 10:27.765
-just to be nice.
-I've been pounding
from the inside

10:27.799 --> 10:30.236
of this wooden crate for a week!

10:30.270 --> 10:31.973
Oh! That's what it was.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.111
If I'd have known that, I
wouldn't have trashed the place.

10:34.144 --> 10:36.315
Good news is pipes are fine.

10:36.348 --> 10:38.052
-NADJA: That is good news.
-(Laszlo chuckles)

10:38.085 --> 10:40.758
NANDOR:
Okay, something
is happening now.

10:40.791 --> 10:43.029
I think he's going to make
a poop in his knickers.

10:43.062 --> 10:45.734
-That, or he's about to
start crying.
-NANDOR: Guillermo.

10:45.768 --> 10:47.872
If you want to cry, that's fine,
we won't judge you.

10:47.905 --> 10:49.374
But if you wish
to poop your pants,

10:49.408 --> 10:50.744
then I'd rather you
go somewhere else and do it.

10:50.778 --> 10:53.082
-You're dead to me.
-Ah.

10:53.115 --> 10:55.019
-You're dead to me.
-Uh...

10:55.053 --> 10:57.224
-You're dead to me!
-NANDOR: The fuck did I do?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.796
Hm. Well, technically,

10:59.829 --> 11:01.298
we're all already dead, so...

11:01.332 --> 11:03.002
-(laughter)
-Nad... Nadja,

11:03.035 --> 11:05.006
that is not helpful
at this particular juncture.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.845
-Goodbye for... Aah!
-NANDOR: Whoa!

11:07.879 --> 11:09.448
-Guillermo, I'm coming!
-(water splashes)

11:09.481 --> 11:11.385
NADJA:
Oh, shit.

11:14.124 --> 11:15.159
LASZLO:
Is he dead?

11:15.193 --> 11:16.796
NADJA:
Oh.

11:16.830 --> 11:18.700
-(Guillermo gasping)
-Bloody hell.

11:18.734 --> 11:19.869
(groans)

11:19.903 --> 11:21.405
-Well, he needed a bath.
-Agreed.

11:22.407 --> 11:24.044
-LASZLO: Charming.
-That's better.

11:33.429 --> 11:35.066
How we feeling?

11:36.235 --> 11:38.707
-I'm fine.
-Mm.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.844
I've had a lot of time
to think about my life lately,

11:40.878 --> 11:43.182
while I was nailed
inside a shipping crate

11:43.216 --> 11:44.852
for two weeks.

11:44.886 --> 11:46.856
I got to start
looking out for number one.

11:48.092 --> 11:49.394
That-that would be me.

11:49.428 --> 11:52.400
In this case,
I'm num-I'm number one.

11:52.434 --> 11:54.171
How's about I fix you up
some, uh...

11:54.204 --> 11:55.808
Glass of water, please.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.444
Glass of water, coming up.

11:57.477 --> 12:01.018
I know that you want to leave,
Guillermo.

12:01.051 --> 12:03.155
You feel disrespected.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.326
Much in the same way,

12:05.360 --> 12:08.466
you disrespected me
by leaving me all alone

12:08.500 --> 12:12.040
at a train station in New Jersey
with my dick in my hand.

12:12.073 --> 12:15.013
-That wasn't my fault.
-Agree to disagree.

12:15.046 --> 12:18.152
Anyway, that was in the past
now, and I forgive you.

12:18.185 --> 12:20.223
And also, I need you to stay

12:20.256 --> 12:23.062
-and do something very important
for me.
-(coughs)

12:23.095 --> 12:24.866
Well...

12:24.899 --> 12:27.538
-what is it?
-It's not... (sighs)

12:27.571 --> 12:31.780
easy thing for
an ancient warrior to ask.

12:34.051 --> 12:36.823
Guillermo de la Cruz.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.025
Did I say it right?

12:38.059 --> 12:40.363
-Yes.
-Once my familiar,

12:40.396 --> 12:43.837
also my bodyguard,
always my friend.

12:43.870 --> 12:46.241
Based on definition of the word.

12:46.275 --> 12:48.045
-You could've stopped there.
-Would you

12:48.079 --> 12:50.551
do me the great honor

12:50.584 --> 12:53.089
of being...

12:53.122 --> 12:55.794
the best man at my wedding?

12:55.828 --> 12:58.265
-You're getting married?
-Yes. Now, don't be jealous.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.103
I'm actually not.

13:00.136 --> 13:02.541
-Oh. Okay.
-I'm really happy for you.

13:02.575 --> 13:04.879
I will accept this great honor.

13:04.912 --> 13:06.315
Great. Good.

13:06.348 --> 13:07.952
GUILLERMO:
I'm still looking out

13:07.985 --> 13:09.454
for number one, I'll just be

13:09.488 --> 13:11.125
Nandor's best man first.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.062
One could argue that
it's way cooler

13:13.095 --> 13:15.400
to be made into a best man
than into a vampire.

13:15.433 --> 13:18.239
(chuckles) Don't know
who would say that, but...

13:18.272 --> 13:19.441
one could argue that.

13:19.474 --> 13:21.579
So, who is she?

13:21.613 --> 13:24.017
-Who is who?
-Your bride-to-be?

13:24.051 --> 13:25.186
-I don't know yet.
-What?

13:25.219 --> 13:26.188
I have not picked one.

13:26.221 --> 13:27.257
You haven't picked one?

13:27.290 --> 13:28.994
I have been very lonely,

13:29.027 --> 13:31.165
and the obvious fix is
to take a bride immediately,

13:31.198 --> 13:33.302
preferably before
the end of the month.

13:33.336 --> 13:35.574
-This seems a bit hasty.
-Thank you.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.079
And you are going to help me
pick my bride,

13:38.112 --> 13:40.383
because that is
what a best man does.

13:40.416 --> 13:42.120
Actually, that's not
what a best man does.

13:42.153 --> 13:43.155
-What a best man does is...
-(Baby Colin giggling)

13:43.189 --> 13:45.059
What the fuck is that?

13:45.093 --> 13:47.130
Oh, this is the creature that
crawled out of the chest cavity

13:47.163 --> 13:49.602
of Colin Robinson's dead body
after he died.

13:49.635 --> 13:52.908
Why does it have a lit candle
on its head?

13:52.942 --> 13:54.579
He could catch on fire or
catch this whole place on fire.

13:54.612 --> 13:56.916
-(Baby Colin sputtering)
-Ah, there he is.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.221
-NANDOR: Yes.
-I found him.
-NADJA: Okay, I found him.

13:59.254 --> 14:01.225
-He's giving me
sweet little kisses.
-No, my darling.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.897
I don't know what you've got
out there, but he's in here.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.868
Oh, okay. Never mind.

14:05.901 --> 14:08.172
-(growling)
-It's just another raccoon.
(laughing)

14:08.205 --> 14:09.942
Okay. He has

14:09.976 --> 14:11.579
the candle on his head
for when he sneaks

14:11.613 --> 14:14.451
down to the basement
and swims in all the sewage.

14:14.484 --> 14:16.088
-It's very dark down there.
-What?

14:16.121 --> 14:17.625
You let him swim in the sewage?

14:17.658 --> 14:19.495
It helps him
shake off the sillies.

14:19.529 --> 14:21.465
Now, I have a little boy

14:21.499 --> 14:23.503
who needs feeding.

14:23.537 --> 14:25.574
There you are.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.143
You like these, don't you?

14:27.177 --> 14:29.147
Are you ready?
Here we go.

14:29.181 --> 14:30.517
-(laughs)
-COLIN: Yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum.

14:30.551 --> 14:32.888
-No.
-Now, sit.

14:32.922 --> 14:35.126
Stay, boy.

14:35.159 --> 14:36.629
And... have at it.

14:36.663 --> 14:38.633
-(grunting)
-(laughing)

14:38.667 --> 14:40.671
GUILLERMO:
Just can't leave
that innocent kid

14:40.704 --> 14:44.010
in this death trap of a house
with those lunatics.

14:45.279 --> 14:47.417
My mom worked a lot
when I was little.

14:47.450 --> 14:51.125
So I had to take care of myself
a lot, and it was hard.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.928
And no kid should

14:52.962 --> 14:54.131
have to go through that.

14:54.164 --> 14:56.335
I'm gonna just focus on me.

14:56.368 --> 14:59.007
Me first. Me.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.911
You're looking at a brand-new
Guillermo de la Cruz.

15:02.247 --> 15:03.550
After I take care of the wedding

15:03.583 --> 15:05.219
and make sure
that child doesn't die.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.125
This is my favorite part
right here...

15:08.159 --> 15:11.031
So, Guillermo
has made a good point.

15:11.064 --> 15:14.004
-Hmm.
-That we should probably make
some concrete steps

15:14.037 --> 15:15.974
into fixing this house,

15:16.008 --> 15:18.713
because it has become
a mortal danger for us

15:18.747 --> 15:21.118
and also for
the little creature

15:21.151 --> 15:23.657
-GUILLERMO: You mean the baby?
-(giggling)
-that clawed its way out of

15:23.690 --> 15:26.295
the chest of the corpse of
our dead friend, Colin Robinson.

15:26.328 --> 15:27.998
Which is what we are doing.

15:28.032 --> 15:30.136
I'm sorry, but I don't know
how watching 15 episodes

15:30.169 --> 15:33.075
of these two dimwits
installing kitchen islands

15:33.109 --> 15:35.079
in other people's homes
is going to help us

15:35.113 --> 15:36.716
-fix our house.
-Yep.
-LASZLO: My darling,

15:36.749 --> 15:39.254
Bran and Toby are brothers
with a keen eye

15:39.287 --> 15:40.991
on interior decor.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.530
They turn
the most mundane property

15:43.563 --> 15:45.667
from shabby, uh, to chic.

15:45.701 --> 15:48.072
-(Nandor groans)
-Tell 'em we're gonna need
a structural engineer,

15:48.105 --> 15:51.044
a team of contractors,
and at least two plumbers.

15:51.078 --> 15:53.149
Guillermo said that
we're gonna need a structural...

15:53.182 --> 15:54.519
-Yeah, we heard him, you prat.
-Yes, he's sitting right there.

15:54.552 --> 15:56.088
Guillermo has decided

15:56.121 --> 15:58.058
that he's no longer
talking to you both

15:58.092 --> 15:59.962
because of the bad way
you have treated him

15:59.996 --> 16:02.367
-over the last 12 years.
-BOTH: Ooh.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.371
A bit of sass from the boy.

16:04.404 --> 16:06.441
(laughter)

16:08.012 --> 16:10.149
NADJA:
Okay, now we are all
friends again,

16:10.183 --> 16:12.253
and we are breaking
each other's balls.

16:12.287 --> 16:13.557
-No, that's really not
what's going on here.
-NADJA: Well, to fix

16:13.590 --> 16:15.159
this house,
we need money, correct?

16:15.193 --> 16:16.563
Does anyone know
if we have any money?

16:16.596 --> 16:18.600
-Anyone? Cash.
-Uh...

16:18.633 --> 16:20.737
-Coin. Gold.
-Moola. Wonga.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.309
-Rubles. Lettuce. Dough.
-Milk. Bread.

16:23.342 --> 16:25.046
-Sweet cream.
-DOLL NADJA: stripper tips.

16:25.079 --> 16:26.649
-Anyone?
-NANDOR: Colin Robinson
was in charge

16:26.683 --> 16:29.321
of paying all the bills
in the house,

16:29.354 --> 16:31.325
and now Colin Robinson is dead.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.062
-No, he's not.
He's right over...
-(crackling)

16:33.095 --> 16:34.565
Oh, no, no, Colin. Colin!

16:34.599 --> 16:36.301
No, Colin. No, no, no.

16:36.335 --> 16:38.038
LASZLO:
That is not Colin Robinson,
so...

16:38.072 --> 16:40.409
-Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

16:40.443 --> 16:43.349
It came from Colin Robinson, but
don't call him Colin Robinson.

16:43.382 --> 16:45.654
-Have a seat, right here.
-LASZLO: I do have
Colin Robinson's

16:45.687 --> 16:48.259
automated teller machine card.

16:48.292 --> 16:51.398
-Ooh.
-But what I don't have,
I'm afraid, is Colin Robinson's

16:51.431 --> 16:54.271
automated teller machine card
password.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.308
-(groans)
-Any ideas?

16:56.341 --> 16:57.678
You can't be that stupid,
can you? Just give me that.

16:57.711 --> 16:59.281
-(Nadja gasps)
-LASZLO: Ooh.

16:59.314 --> 17:01.385
This boy's grown some claws.

17:01.418 --> 17:03.422
Hey, buddy. I'm Guillermo.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.193
-What's your name?
-Colin.

17:05.226 --> 17:06.496
LASZLO:
Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.132
The only reason
why he said that is

17:08.165 --> 17:09.602
'cause he's heard you say Colin
many times.

17:09.635 --> 17:11.739
Okay. Hey, buddy.

17:11.773 --> 17:14.044
Do you know the password
to this card?

17:14.077 --> 17:17.417
-Three.
-Three. Can we get
a-a piece of paper and pen?

17:17.450 --> 17:19.589
-Good job. Very good.
-My quill, my quill.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.759
-Three-three. What else?
-Three, yes.

17:21.793 --> 17:23.663
-One.
-One.
-NANDOR: One.

17:23.697 --> 17:25.500
-LASZLO: Hang on.
-BABY COLIN: Four.
-GUILLERMO: Four.

17:25.534 --> 17:26.769
-NANDOR: Four.
-GUILLERMO: Anything else,
Colin?

17:26.803 --> 17:28.305
-One.
-One.
-NANDOR: One.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.709
LASZLO:
This is quite miraculous.

17:33.349 --> 17:35.554
Four. Three.

17:35.587 --> 17:39.327
-One. Zero. Two.
-At least I tried.

17:39.361 --> 17:41.031
-LASZLO: Bloody waste of time.
-(sighs)

17:46.408 --> 17:48.078
NADJA:
Do you know what could be
a very good moneymaker?

17:48.112 --> 17:51.351
Opening up
our own vampire nightclub.

17:51.385 --> 17:53.188
Ooh, yes, a great idea.

17:53.222 --> 17:55.226
-A what?
-NADJA: A vampire nightclub.

17:55.259 --> 17:56.428
Like in the film Blade,

17:56.461 --> 17:58.232
with the blood sprinklers

17:58.265 --> 17:59.535
and the live F and S show.

17:59.568 --> 18:01.606
-Imagine!
-NANDOR: I got it.

18:01.639 --> 18:03.510
We rob Fort Knox.

18:03.543 --> 18:06.616
Guillermo, I am going to need
600 yards of strong rope.

18:06.649 --> 18:08.787
Why would you need
that much rope?

18:08.820 --> 18:11.458
-You got any better ideas?
-Uh, I just said one.

18:11.492 --> 18:14.130
-She just said one.
-LASZLO: Well, if you two
are considering

18:14.164 --> 18:17.403
selling my TV projector monitor,
then you can get fucked.

18:17.437 --> 18:19.207
-Hmm.
-The new series of
Go Flip Yourself

18:19.240 --> 18:20.744
starts next week,

18:20.777 --> 18:23.717
where Bran and Toby face
their biggest challenges yet.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.587
-Hmm.
-Guys, could we circle back?

18:25.621 --> 18:27.323
I'm telling you,
the nightclub business--

18:27.357 --> 18:30.262
-it is a cash-only business.
-I've got it.

18:30.296 --> 18:32.300
We break into
Henry Ford's house,

18:32.333 --> 18:34.270
-Oh...
-and we steal all his money.

18:34.304 --> 18:36.776
Guillermo, I'm just gonna need
ten yards of strong rope.

18:36.809 --> 18:38.412
NADJA:
I did learn three

18:38.445 --> 18:40.316
very valuable lessons
on my trip to England.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.188
Number one, if you go to work

18:43.222 --> 18:44.759
for the Supreme Worldwide
Vampiric Council,

18:44.792 --> 18:46.461
do not let them

18:46.496 --> 18:48.833
put you on a ten-year
Vampiric Planning Committee,

18:48.867 --> 18:50.704
'cause that is
where they just stick

18:50.737 --> 18:53.810
Z-list and C-list vampires
to just sit around,

18:53.843 --> 18:55.446
talking about boring admin
all day.

18:55.479 --> 18:58.185
And that is why the focus
of our five-year plan

18:58.218 --> 18:59.855
should be to form a variety

18:59.889 --> 19:02.160
of subcommittees
and study groups...

19:02.193 --> 19:03.763
NADJA:
And the second thing
I learned is,

19:03.797 --> 19:06.168
as a woman,
sometimes you do need

19:06.201 --> 19:08.305
to use your special voice
to be heard.

19:08.339 --> 19:11.445
I was too afraid to use mine in
the Vampiric Council meetings,

19:11.478 --> 19:13.282
and I deeply regret that.

19:13.315 --> 19:14.451
Unless anyone has
anything else, I think we can...

19:14.484 --> 19:15.554
If I could?

19:15.587 --> 19:17.357
I have prepared a little pitch.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.929
Another way we could
possibly go with our...

19:19.962 --> 19:21.566
-(upbeat music plays)
-five-year plan.

19:23.268 --> 19:25.907
I have just two words for you.

19:27.745 --> 19:30.584
Vampire nightclub.

19:30.617 --> 19:32.420
And that's
the other thing I learned.

19:32.453 --> 19:34.792
I just really want to open
a vampiric nightclub!

19:34.825 --> 19:36.228
I mean, come on.

19:36.261 --> 19:37.731
It's a no-brainer.

19:37.765 --> 19:41.204
Oh, Nadja, every new vampire
comes up with this idea,

19:41.238 --> 19:43.442
and it's not what we do here.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.812
Oh.

19:44.845 --> 19:46.481
Okay.

19:46.516 --> 19:47.951
Thank you for your time.

19:47.985 --> 19:49.822
And so that is when
I decided to quit

19:49.855 --> 19:52.293
the Worldwide Supreme
Vampiric Council and come home.

19:52.326 --> 19:53.797
Okay, this is ridiculous.
You're all vampires.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.433
Just go to the bank
and hypnotize the teller...

19:55.466 --> 19:56.903
Enough!

19:56.936 --> 19:59.207
-Whoa!
-Whoa!
-GUILLERMO: Shit!

19:59.240 --> 20:01.311
-(high-pitched tone)
-(muffled): Whoa!
-(muffled groaning)

20:01.344 --> 20:02.981
-(tone stops)
-(groaning becomes clear)
-(clears throat)

20:03.015 --> 20:06.254
I am telling you, we are going
to open a vampire nightclub.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.461
-Any questions?
-Works for me.
-Fine and dandy by this boy.

20:09.495 --> 20:10.864
What?

20:11.933 --> 20:14.404
So, was it great being back home

20:14.437 --> 20:15.507
in Al Qolnidar?

20:15.540 --> 20:16.776
No, it was not.

20:16.809 --> 20:18.412
I returned back to my village,

20:18.445 --> 20:20.316
and it was exactly
how I left it,

20:20.349 --> 20:23.388
except everyone
had become vampires.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.660
So, wasn't it nice
to be among your own kind?

20:25.694 --> 20:26.863
I hated it.

20:26.896 --> 20:28.533
If everyone is a vampire,

20:28.566 --> 20:30.336
there's nothing special
about being a vampire.

20:30.369 --> 20:31.873
It was not good
for my mental health.

20:31.906 --> 20:33.877
-Are you two tits coming
or what?
-NANDOR: Yes,

20:33.910 --> 20:35.714
yes. There's no need to shout.

20:36.883 --> 20:39.320
-Oh.
-NANDOR: Oh...

20:39.354 --> 20:40.857
Hello?!

20:40.891 --> 20:42.494
-Guillermo, get the lights.
-NANDOR: Guillermo,

20:42.528 --> 20:43.897
-get the lights.
-LASZLO: Gizmo, get the lights.

20:43.930 --> 20:46.001
Why do I have to still do it?

20:46.034 --> 20:47.805
Oh. (shudders)

20:47.838 --> 20:49.909
-GUIDE: There you are.
-LASZLO: Shit.

20:49.942 --> 20:51.712
What the hell are you doing?

20:51.746 --> 20:54.819
Just sitting here, waiting
for you guys to come back.

20:54.852 --> 20:57.591
-For a year?
-What? A year?

20:57.624 --> 20:58.993
-(Nadja coughs)
-Oh, wow.

20:59.027 --> 21:01.031
Guess I was just so afraid
if I got up,

21:01.064 --> 21:03.001
that would be the moment
you would come in.

21:03.035 --> 21:04.772
You know? So I just waited.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.308
-(joins crack)
-(scattered groans)

21:06.341 --> 21:07.845
Well... (chuckles)

21:07.878 --> 21:10.650
We have a lot of Council
business to catch up on, huh?

21:10.684 --> 21:13.623
Actually, no.
No more business as usual.

21:13.656 --> 21:17.430
-Change of direction.
-Oh, that's something
I really enjoy.

21:17.463 --> 21:19.467
-I'll tell you what it is.
-Okay.

21:19.502 --> 21:22.975
We are opening a motherfucking
vampire nightclub, baby!

21:23.008 --> 21:25.446
Cool. Where?

21:25.479 --> 21:26.582
Here.

21:26.616 --> 21:27.784
NANDOR:
Yes.

21:27.818 --> 21:29.387
-No.
-NADJA: Yes.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.492
We are opening
a vampire nightclub.

21:31.526 --> 21:34.765
And if any of you motherfuckers
get in my way,

21:34.799 --> 21:38.472
you will surely
live to regret it!
