WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.209
Previously on...

00:02.233 --> 00:04.120
You put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.

00:04.144 --> 00:06.083
Do you have some kind
of problem with alcohol?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.714
Lynette asked a loaded question.

00:07.738 --> 00:10.357
I'm the one who was
sleeping with your son,

00:10.381 --> 00:12.159
but it's over now.

00:12.183 --> 00:15.167
No, you're wrong. It's not
even close to being over.

00:15.191 --> 00:16.393
Gabrielle confessed...

00:16.417 --> 00:20.197
Here's your mail.
While Noah's search for Zach...

00:20.221 --> 00:21.568
I worry for that boy.

00:21.592 --> 00:23.630
What kind of people would
buy a baby from a junkie?

00:23.654 --> 00:26.111
Played perfectly
into Felicia's plot...

00:26.135 --> 00:30.407
See that Paul young has
a toy chest of his very own.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.210
For revenge.

00:33.234 --> 00:37.144
What made my husband Paul young
such a good investor

00:37.168 --> 00:40.187
was his uncanny ability
to anticipate the future...

00:40.211 --> 00:43.320
Zach, how did you do this?

00:43.344 --> 00:47.124
He foresaw the necessity
of the velcro shoe.

00:47.148 --> 00:52.499
He predicted the advent
of the $3 cup of coffee.

00:52.523 --> 00:54.661
He even anticipated

00:54.685 --> 00:57.204
the surprising boom
in bottled water.

00:57.228 --> 00:59.136
Yeah, it's Paul young.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.239
I've been reading about
the election results in Brazil.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.740
It's time to buy sugar.

01:08.539 --> 01:10.217
But the crystal ball

01:10.241 --> 01:12.519
that served Paul so well
in the stock market

01:12.543 --> 01:15.822
sometimes failed him
closer to home.

01:15.846 --> 01:17.784
Paul young? Yeah.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.086
Detective Sullivan.

01:19.110 --> 01:21.088
You need to come downtown
for questioning.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.129
About what?

01:22.153 --> 01:24.166
We're investigating reports
of credit card fraud,

01:24.190 --> 01:27.164
and your name has been linked
with several of the victims.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.166
Well, it must be some mistake.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.267
Could be.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.140
But we still need to go downtown
and straighten it out.

01:33.164 --> 01:34.671
All right.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.303
Well...

01:36.327 --> 01:38.305
How long is this gonna take?

01:38.329 --> 01:41.199
Don't worry about it.
It's just a mix-up.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.180
Let's go.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.596
What's going on?
I thought you just wanted

01:59.620 --> 02:01.328
to ask me some questions.

02:01.352 --> 02:04.176
That's after you're booked.
Booked? Booked for what?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.373
You can't book him
here anyhow, detective.

02:06.397 --> 02:07.874
Computers are down.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.376
We're all full up.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.408
You gotta
take him down to county.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.380
What is going on? This is crazy.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.712
I wanna call my lawyer.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.146
What the hell do you guys
think you're doing anyway? Huh?

02:19.170 --> 02:20.670
This is ridiculous.

02:24.415 --> 02:26.145
I get a phone call!

02:28.179 --> 02:31.127
Yes, in the world
of investments,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.129
my husband
had a remarkable ability

02:33.153 --> 02:35.202
to see the future.

02:35.226 --> 02:37.264
Got a message for you,
Paul young.

02:37.288 --> 02:41.658
Dierdre's father
said to give you his regards.

02:44.895 --> 02:46.543
Aah!

02:46.567 --> 02:54.567
But sadly, Paul didn't
see this one coming at all.

02:57.348 --> 02:59.326
Bree Van De Kamp
had a weekly routine

02:59.350 --> 03:02.550
she'd been following for years.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.694
She cleaned on Tuesdays.

03:07.718 --> 03:11.668
She paid her bills
on wednesdays.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.672
She did her laundry
on Thursdays.

03:16.367 --> 03:18.745
And after these daily chores
were completed,

03:18.769 --> 03:22.349
she would reward herself
with a little drink.

03:22.373 --> 03:23.850
What Bree didn't know

03:23.874 --> 03:26.713
was this latest addition
to her routine

03:26.737 --> 03:28.685
had been noticed by her friends.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.359
And it had now become
part of their routine

03:32.383 --> 03:34.221
to discuss it.

03:34.245 --> 03:37.494
So apparently Bree had
a few too many and passed out.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.367
Next thing I know,
I get a call at work...

03:40.391 --> 03:43.300
Someone found my kids
wandering the street.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.841
Oh,
my god! Have you seen Bree since?

03:45.865 --> 03:47.834
No. I'm worried about her,

03:47.858 --> 03:50.828
but I don't know how I'm gonna
get over what she did.

03:58.369 --> 04:01.648
Hey, Bree. How you doing today?

04:01.672 --> 04:03.720
I'm really well.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.698
Um, I just saw you all talking
before Lynette went off to work.

04:07.722 --> 04:09.526
What were you all talking about?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.997
Oh, nothing, really.

04:11.021 --> 04:13.660
Carlos and I are gonna go see
the adoption counselor today.

04:13.684 --> 04:15.667
I'm checking myself
into the hospital.

04:15.691 --> 04:18.265
I'm finally gonna get that
surgery. Oh. Good for you.

04:18.289 --> 04:22.669
Did Lynette mention
the little tiff we had?

04:22.693 --> 04:25.372
Just in passing.

04:25.396 --> 04:26.543
She barely mentioned it.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.346
Because what happened was,
I accidentally mixed

04:29.370 --> 04:31.548
my antihistamine medication
with, you know,

04:31.572 --> 04:33.550
a little glass of wine
I was having,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.361
and I-I fell asleep,
you know, while I was...

04:36.385 --> 04:38.024
Watching her kids.

04:38.048 --> 04:40.327
I mean, I like a little wine
with dinner,

04:40.351 --> 04:42.629
I mean, now and then.
You know, who doesn't?

04:42.653 --> 04:45.532
But, uh, I mean, you know,

04:45.556 --> 04:47.694
to trash my entire reputation...

04:47.718 --> 04:50.737
Oh, Bree,
she didn't trash you. Honest.

04:50.761 --> 04:53.970
Well, good. I mean, I just...

04:53.994 --> 04:56.378
I really wouldn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

04:56.402 --> 04:58.475
Well, I'm... I'm going
to the mall.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.547
They're having
a white sale today.

05:00.571 --> 05:01.878
I think I'm gonna
get a new bath mat.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.811
Oh, does anyone need one?
No, I'm good.

05:04.835 --> 05:06.675
Okay, take care.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.890
Wow, did you smell
the alcohol on her breath?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.922
I sure did.

05:15.946 --> 05:17.594
Oh.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.397
Then our eskimo
turns in the camera and says,

05:20.421 --> 05:25.331
"polar fresh mints will give
your breath an 'a'-plus, too."

05:26.597 --> 05:30.306
So what do you think?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.009
It feels a little familiar.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.811
Really? I don't think so.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.813
No, I'm pretty sure
the lowell group used eskimos

05:36.837 --> 05:39.346
in a deodorant commercial
they had last month.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.348
Remember? Oh,
this is completely different.

05:41.372 --> 05:43.350
Those were jock eskimos
competing in the iditarod.

05:43.374 --> 05:45.427
Our eskimo's
trying to, you know,

05:45.451 --> 05:47.424
patch things up with his wife.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.496
Yeah. No, I get
the subtle distinction.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.628
I think we can do better.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.662
Okay? So, Sally, you're up.
What do you got for me?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.470
Hey. Hey.

06:03.494 --> 06:05.521
"I got the subtle distinction"?

06:05.545 --> 06:07.013
What was that about?

06:07.037 --> 06:09.376
If you really wanna do this now,
shut the door.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.378
Okay, sure,
I was a little bitchy.

06:11.402 --> 06:14.020
But you know why?
You did a half-ass job in there.

06:14.044 --> 06:16.723
Hey, you may not like my idea,

06:16.747 --> 06:20.557
but you can't say I didn't work hard. Oh,
please. I live with you.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.459
Last night,
when you should've been

06:22.483 --> 06:24.740
trying to make that pitch work,
you were watching the game.

06:24.764 --> 06:27.394
I wasn't watching
the game. I saw you!

06:27.418 --> 06:30.136
What, okay,
now I can't check the score? Are you saying

06:30.160 --> 06:32.639
you gave your heart and soul
to that eskimo pitch?

06:32.663 --> 06:37.073
I worked really hard on that
pitch. Did you give it 100%?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.545
Well, exactly. So? Big deal.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.847
Go work up some new ideas,

06:40.871 --> 06:43.510
and then we'll
go over it during lunch.

06:43.534 --> 06:45.712
Okay?

06:45.736 --> 06:49.085
You're the boss.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.509
Yes, I am.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.522
Hey.

06:55.546 --> 06:58.425
Susan. Good to see you again.

06:58.449 --> 07:00.667
I'm really looking forward
to your surgery.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.669
And I'm really hoping
you're a lefty.

07:02.693 --> 07:04.676
Nope. I can't even
write my name.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.474
But that's what I get
for throwing my kid

07:07.498 --> 07:10.837
a roller-skating party. Funny.
So what about my surgery?

07:10.861 --> 07:14.581
Oh, I'll still do it.
With Dr. Ron's help, of course.

07:14.605 --> 07:16.583
Dr. Cunningham will
be standing right beside me.

07:16.607 --> 07:18.084
With my hands and his brain,

07:18.108 --> 07:21.017
you got the best parts of
both of us. Then I'm on board.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.520
We're keeping you
under observation,

07:23.544 --> 07:24.761
so, hopefully,
we'll operate tomorrow.

07:24.785 --> 07:26.493
Uh, if you don't mind,

07:26.517 --> 07:29.195
I'd like a minute
to consult with my patient.

07:29.219 --> 07:32.549
Oh! Right,
your, um, little thing.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.533
What "little thing"?

07:36.557 --> 07:40.006
Um, well, it was... it was gonna
be a surprise, but...

07:40.030 --> 07:42.939
Ahem.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.503
Oh, my god, they're beautiful.

07:48.599 --> 07:52.048
Um, look, I've been thinking
about us a lot lately...

07:52.072 --> 07:54.050
About putting
this operation behind us

07:54.074 --> 07:56.061
and where we'll go from there.

07:56.085 --> 07:58.525
Our future...

07:58.549 --> 07:59.756
Together.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.759
And I really suck at putting
my emotions into words,

08:02.783 --> 08:05.932
which is, um,
it's why I wrote it all down.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.463
There's a card.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.665
Oh.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.698
Uh, but you can't read it.
Not... not while I'm here anyway.

08:11.722 --> 08:15.672
It's way, way too stressful.
Um, I am going to go now.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.153
Wow.

08:27.177 --> 08:29.607
Wow.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.111
Oh, he's so romantic.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.823
May I?

08:37.847 --> 08:40.226
Oh, it's sort of private.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.999
Well, I did help him
pick out the flowers.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.703
Oh. Um...

08:46.727 --> 08:48.957
Okay.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.613
There's more on the back.

09:02.613 --> 09:04.290
So how does this work?

09:04.314 --> 09:07.298
Do we flip through a catalog or
something? I wish it was that easy.

09:07.322 --> 09:09.295
You have to understand,
for every baby,

09:09.319 --> 09:11.297
there are ten couples
who want it.

09:11.321 --> 09:14.668
You don't choose your child.
The birth mother chooses you.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.262
Really?

09:16.286 --> 09:18.264
So what do you think
our chances are?

09:18.288 --> 09:20.667
We will do anything
that we need to do.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.969
Well, your typical birth mother
is usually a young girl,

09:22.993 --> 09:25.950
and she'll just wanna make sure
you're quality people.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.644
Now to show her that,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.616
you'll be putting together
a parent portfolio.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.777
What's that?

09:30.801 --> 09:32.679
Family pictures,
character references,

09:32.703 --> 09:34.681
that kind of stuff.

09:34.705 --> 09:37.784
So, um, we're auditioning
to be parents?

09:37.808 --> 09:39.626
I guess you could say that.

09:39.650 --> 09:41.988
So just to be clear,

09:42.012 --> 09:44.996
some slutty cheerleader gets
knocked up by the soccer coach

09:45.020 --> 09:46.993
behind the local gas 'n gulp,

09:47.017 --> 09:50.057
andsheis going to make sure
we'requality people?

09:51.722 --> 09:54.902
You don't need to answer that.

10:00.170 --> 10:03.149
You know, you don't
have to hide it from me.

10:03.173 --> 10:04.881
Hmm?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.213
Drinking. It doesn't bother me.

10:07.237 --> 10:09.255
Oh, I wasn't hiding anything.

10:09.279 --> 10:12.989
I was simply...
Enjoying the day.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.691
What you want?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.693
Well, um, Mason
was my ride to school.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.965
And his dad's
moving them to Tucson so...

10:18.989 --> 10:20.867
Oh, well, if you need
a ride to school,

10:20.891 --> 10:22.869
I'm happy to drive you.

10:22.893 --> 10:25.902
No, that's not what I want.
I want a car.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.234
Well, then I suggest
you get a job.

10:28.258 --> 10:31.237
Why should I go work my ass off
at some fast food place

10:31.261 --> 10:33.710
when I can already afford
what I want?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.743
Andrew, we're not touching
your trust fund.

10:36.767 --> 10:39.015
It's my money.
Not until you're 21.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.747
And if I had my way,

10:40.771 --> 10:43.750
you wouldn't get your hands
on it until you're 50.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.761
I mean, we both know you're
gonna waste every penny of it.

10:46.785 --> 10:49.155
Why are you being like this?

10:49.179 --> 10:50.356
Because, sweetheart,

10:50.380 --> 10:53.629
it is my job to teach you
about responsibility,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.833
setting goals,
delayed gratification.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.865
What do you know
about delayed gratification?

10:58.889 --> 11:00.366
It's not even noon,

11:00.390 --> 11:02.939
yet you're already on
your third glass of wine.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.640
You know, on second thought,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.647
I won't be driving you
to school.

11:06.671 --> 11:09.175
The walk will do you good. Mom,
I'm not kidding around.

11:09.199 --> 11:10.817
I want my money.

11:10.841 --> 11:13.249
The answer is no.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.783
Well,
aren't we a mean old drunk?

11:17.848 --> 11:20.857
Whatever that was
supposed to teach me,

11:20.881 --> 11:22.811
consider the lesson learned.

11:35.726 --> 11:36.703
Oh. Whoo.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.044
What are you doing here?

11:38.068 --> 11:41.047
I'm just enjoying the silky
smooth moves of Dr. Ron.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.009
Or should I say, "Dr. Love"?

11:43.033 --> 11:45.016
Give me that. Aah!
This is my favorite...

11:45.040 --> 11:47.814
"I can't wait to be
in the operating room with you"

11:47.838 --> 11:49.415
"so I can touch your heart,"

11:49.439 --> 11:52.318
"because you've already
touched mine so deeply."

11:52.342 --> 11:55.396
Okay, that part sounds better
when you don't read it out loud.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.393
And what are you doing
reading it anyway?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.466
Those are Dr. Ron's private thoughts. Yeah,
I got that.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.029
You know, I sense that he really likes you,
susie. So?

12:03.053 --> 12:04.871
So do you really like him?

12:04.895 --> 12:07.904
Of course I do.
He's smart and funny and kind.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.136
Smart, funny, kind.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.779
I don't hear the word
"love" in there.

12:12.803 --> 12:15.041
Well, that's a big word.

12:15.065 --> 12:17.183
We just started dating,
and we have a connection,

12:17.207 --> 12:20.116
and I'm gonna follow it through
and see where it goes.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.118
Oh, I get it.
You're gonna string him along

12:22.142 --> 12:24.120
till you feel
something you don't

12:24.144 --> 12:26.497
and waste the next five years
of your life.

12:26.521 --> 12:28.424
As opposed to the 12
I wasted on you?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.927
Why are we talking about this?

12:30.951 --> 12:33.129
I don't recall
asking you your opinion.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.736
Because we're married
and I have certain rights,

12:35.760 --> 12:38.434
and one of them
is the right to badger you.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.436
Okay, you know,
you can leave now.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.009
I wish I could m.R.I.
Your soul... out!

12:44.865 --> 12:46.142
It's not funny.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.867
Hey, watch out for my wife.
She's on a tear.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.984
Oh, here's one we took
on vacation.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.257
Hmm. Gaby, these pictures
have to be wholesome.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.159
They gotta say...

13:03.183 --> 13:06.362
"These people will do
a great job raising a child."

13:06.386 --> 13:07.363
So?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.195
So you're topless.

13:09.219 --> 13:11.267
Yeah, but it's St. barts,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.940
and your hands are covering
my naughty parts.

13:13.964 --> 13:16.547
Do you mean the hand
that's holding the Tequila shot,

13:16.571 --> 13:19.245
or the one that's holding
the Cuban cigar?

13:19.269 --> 13:21.277
Yeah, that was a good trip.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.249
Gaby!

13:23.273 --> 13:26.017
Fine. We won't use it.
We can't use any of 'em.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.014
Every single picture
of the two of us,

13:28.038 --> 13:30.016
we're either drinking
or smoking or naked.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.019
So we like to have fun. I mean,
who doesn't understand that

13:33.043 --> 13:34.790
better than an unwed,
knocked-up teenager?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.792
This is serious.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.266
If we can't sell ourselves
as good people...

13:40.290 --> 13:43.299
Well, then we'll just
have to find someone

13:43.323 --> 13:45.503
who can do itforus.

13:47.858 --> 13:51.037
So you want me to, uh...
Pitch you as parents?

13:51.061 --> 13:53.309
You're in advertising.
You can do it.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.316
Just write us
a character reference

13:55.340 --> 13:57.313
saying we're great with kids.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.885
Oh, this is for you.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.887
Oh. Well, you don't
have to bribe me.

14:00.911 --> 14:03.489
We're all friends here.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.526
Keeping that in mind,
would it also be okay

14:05.550 --> 14:07.523
if we were
your kids' godparents?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.525
Oh! Uh...

14:09.549 --> 14:10.897
I guess.

14:10.921 --> 14:13.900
Great, and can we take some
fake pictures to document it?

14:15.325 --> 14:17.864
I don't suppose
you brought a corkscrew?

14:17.888 --> 14:20.036
You didn't have a warrant,
and if you don't arrest him,

14:20.060 --> 14:22.838
then you gotta tell me
what he wants.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.919
Hello, Mike. Felicia,
what are you doing here?

14:25.943 --> 14:27.914
Oh, I left in such a rush.

14:27.938 --> 14:30.917
There was a lot of old business
I forgot to wrap up.

14:30.941 --> 14:32.919
Well, it must be
pretty important business,

14:32.943 --> 14:35.421
gets you to move
back in next door to the man

14:35.445 --> 14:37.553
you think murdered your sister.
It's funny you should mention Paul.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.927
You know, the police came
and took him away last night.

14:40.951 --> 14:42.058
The police?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.936
And from the way
they were manhandling him,

14:44.960 --> 14:47.433
ooh, I don't think
he'll be back anytime soon.

14:47.457 --> 14:51.497
No, I just wanna
talk to him, that's all...

14:56.396 --> 14:58.044
What the hell's going on?

14:58.068 --> 15:00.176
It's none of your concern, Mike.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.878
You listen to me, if anything
happens to Paul young...

15:02.902 --> 15:05.081
It already happened.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.183
Hours ago.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.885
He's dead?

15:09.909 --> 15:13.489
Like I said,
it's none of your concern.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.067
Maybe you don't get it, Noah.
You screwed up.

15:16.091 --> 15:18.064
You just killed
the most important person

15:18.088 --> 15:19.365
in your grandson's life.

15:19.389 --> 15:22.068
Do you think he's gonna have
anything to do with you

15:22.092 --> 15:23.669
once he finds out?
And believe me,

15:23.693 --> 15:26.063
I'll make sure he finds out.

15:36.106 --> 15:39.615
So, honey, the meat loaf...
It's, um, it's a little burnt.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.618
Oh, right, I was talking
to Susan on the phone,

15:42.642 --> 15:45.659
and I left it in a little longer
than I should've. Sorry.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.024
It's okay.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.226
Is it that bad?

15:50.250 --> 15:53.059
No. No, not bad at all.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.700
Oh, good.

15:54.724 --> 15:57.538
Parker, don't put your elbows
on the table. Come on.

15:57.562 --> 16:00.306
But you'd agree
it wasn't your best effort.

16:00.330 --> 16:01.937
Huh?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.939
The meal, the task
you agreed to take on.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.977
You'd agree that
you didn't give it 100%, right?

16:06.001 --> 16:08.074
Tom, if you're gonna
make a point,

16:08.098 --> 16:11.317
why don't you do it now
before I hurl the plate at you?

16:11.341 --> 16:15.128
Nobody gives 100% of his effort
all the time because they can't.

16:15.152 --> 16:16.622
It is impossible.

16:16.646 --> 16:19.425
You do the best you can with
the time and energy you have.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.427
Stop right there.
This is meat loaf.

16:21.451 --> 16:23.659
Your presentation was business.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.170
You're saying the client
deserves more effort

16:26.194 --> 16:28.516
than your own family?

16:33.063 --> 16:34.100
Okay.

16:34.124 --> 16:38.244
So if I apologize
for upsetting you at work,

16:38.268 --> 16:41.107
can we get past it
and enjoy our meal?

16:41.131 --> 16:42.348
Absolutely.

16:42.372 --> 16:47.053
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

16:47.077 --> 16:48.107
Thanks.

16:52.142 --> 16:54.620
So, boys, how doyouenjoy
the meat loaf?

16:54.644 --> 16:56.122
It's a little salty.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.124
Yeah.

16:58.148 --> 17:00.448
Just eat it.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.434
There. Perfect.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.759
All right.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.053
All right, one more time.

17:27.077 --> 17:28.594
What?

17:28.618 --> 17:31.397
Yeah. Dude,
I don't wanna mess up your face.

17:31.421 --> 17:34.029
Do you love me?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.433
Then do what I tell you.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.477
Rough day.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.079
Yeah.

17:53.103 --> 17:56.783
I wonder if there's any way that
we can turn it around still.

18:00.810 --> 18:03.389
Good question.

18:03.413 --> 18:05.391
But what to do? What to do?

18:05.415 --> 18:06.585
Yeah.

18:22.172 --> 18:23.309
Oh!

18:23.333 --> 18:25.251
Hi! What's up?

18:25.275 --> 18:27.483
Why do you keep
trying to do that? What?

18:27.507 --> 18:30.216
Trying to get on top.
Of you? No, I'm not.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.219
You were pushing on me like
you were trying to sack me.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.221
I felt it. Are you serious?

18:35.245 --> 18:38.264
Tom, I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going for it.

18:38.288 --> 18:41.397
I was just lost in the moment.
Oh, come on!

18:41.421 --> 18:45.331
Come on, this is silly.
I don't wanna argue.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.333
I mean, unless it turns you on.

18:47.357 --> 18:50.797
Does it? 'Cause then
I'm all about it, baby.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.784
What... what was that?

18:58.808 --> 19:00.586
What... what was what?

19:00.610 --> 19:03.118
You were bracing.
You were bracing with your leg.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.120
I was trying
to lie on top of you,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.161
and you were bracing yourself
against the mattress

19:07.185 --> 19:09.124
so you didn't
have to get on your back.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.297
Try and deny it.
Try and deny it. You can't.

19:11.321 --> 19:13.299
Okay, okay, can I just mention

19:13.323 --> 19:16.807
you're talking like a crazy person?
You can't give it up for a second, can you?

19:16.831 --> 19:18.804
You always have
to call the shots. Always.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.766
Is this about
me being boss again?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.330
You gotta get over it.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.142
That's exactly my point.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.143
Exactly.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.145
You are not
just my boss at the office.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.147
You're my boss everywhere.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.450
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You run the show.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.328
You run the show,
and I'm along for the ride.

19:37.352 --> 19:39.325
I just push
the little shopping cart,

19:39.349 --> 19:41.887
let the woman do
all the driving. Tom...

19:41.911 --> 19:44.690
I'm the caddy husband.

19:44.714 --> 19:47.333
I carry your clubs.

19:47.357 --> 19:50.596
I amsosorry you feel that way,

19:50.620 --> 19:53.699
but you cannot put that on me.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.701
This is your life.

19:55.725 --> 19:58.944
You wanna run it?
Then step on up.

19:58.968 --> 20:02.278
You wanna drive?
Grab the steering wheel.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.649
I mean...

20:03.673 --> 20:06.212
What else am I supposed to say?

20:06.236 --> 20:10.336
I'm gonna check on the kids.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.197
Time to check
your blood pressure.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.951
Oh, sure.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.235
Oh, that's a little tight.
Does it have to be that tight?

20:29.259 --> 20:31.999
Yes. Oh.

20:37.467 --> 20:41.247
Okay. Ow, ow. That's actually
starting to be painful.

20:41.271 --> 20:43.389
Really? That surprises me.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.426
I just assumed
you were dead inside.

20:45.450 --> 20:47.693
Ow! Ow! What the hell
are you doing?

20:47.717 --> 20:51.226
I told myself to stay
out of this, but I can't.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.228
I know that you're
married. I am not!

20:53.252 --> 20:56.469
Really? Hmm, 'cause that man
that came to see you yesterday,

20:56.493 --> 20:58.264
he said you're his wife.

20:58.288 --> 20:59.635
Oh! Yeah, oh...

20:59.659 --> 21:02.368
No, no, he just said that
'cause we used to be married.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.670
It's just a force of habit. Oh,
that explains everything.

21:04.694 --> 21:06.477
Except that I checked
your insurance forms,

21:06.501 --> 21:07.973
and you're still married.

21:07.997 --> 21:10.516
So that makes you
a lying, adulterousskank.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.679
Oh, no. No, no.
No, no, nurse hisel.

21:13.703 --> 21:16.322
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, nurse hisel!

21:16.346 --> 21:19.325
Ugh! Nurse... oh!

21:19.349 --> 21:20.749
Oh!

21:24.414 --> 21:26.862
Nurse hisel, I can explain.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.834
Can you, skank?

21:28.858 --> 21:30.696
Yes. Okay.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.799
Iammarried, but it's only
because my insurance ran out.

21:33.823 --> 21:35.310
My ex-husband has
a really good coverage plan,

21:35.334 --> 21:37.303
so he said that
he would remarry me

21:37.327 --> 21:39.305
so I could get my operation.

21:39.329 --> 21:41.307
Only I didn't wanna tell Dr. Ron

21:41.331 --> 21:44.750
'cause I didn't want him
to be an accomplice to fraud.

21:44.774 --> 21:48.314
So you're what...
Protecting him?

21:48.338 --> 21:52.418
Yeah. It... yes, I am.

21:52.442 --> 21:54.720
Okay.

21:54.744 --> 21:56.731
As long as you're not
two-timing him.

21:56.755 --> 21:59.665
He feels so strongly about you.

21:59.689 --> 22:01.767
I know. I read the card.

22:01.791 --> 22:03.899
But did you read
between the lines?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.501
What do you mean?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.503
Okay, I shouldn't be
telling you this,

22:07.527 --> 22:10.506
but when we were picking out
the flowers for you,

22:10.530 --> 22:14.309
he said that he was working up
the courage to say he loves you.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.011
Really?

22:16.035 --> 22:17.343
Yes!

22:17.367 --> 22:19.345
But you have
to act surprised, okay?

22:19.369 --> 22:21.947
Oh, yeah, I'll be surprised.

22:21.971 --> 22:25.398
So I guess we have the whole
insurance thing worked out.

22:25.422 --> 22:28.594
Oh! Pfft. Don't worry
about that. Please.

22:28.618 --> 22:30.526
Who am I to cast stones?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.358
I mean, heck...

22:32.382 --> 22:34.630
I didn't pass my nurse's exam.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.534
They didn't even ask me!

22:47.096 --> 22:49.845
Andrew, did I hear the bell?

22:49.869 --> 22:53.519
Oh, hello. I'm Samuel
bormanis. I'm here to see Andrew.

22:53.543 --> 22:56.030
Oh, okay.
Are you a friend of Andrew's?

22:56.054 --> 22:58.454
I'm his lawyer.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.956
His lawyer? Well, why on earth
would Andrew need a lawyer?

23:00.980 --> 23:03.589
Here you go, Sam.

23:04.954 --> 23:06.792
Honey, what happened to...

23:06.816 --> 23:08.464
To your face?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.536
I...

23:10.560 --> 23:12.037
You hit me.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.561
Don't you remember?

23:16.826 --> 23:18.874
For the record,
I did not punch my son.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.447
I slapped him with an open palm.

23:21.471 --> 23:23.449
Yeah, but, mom, the thing is,

23:23.473 --> 23:26.460
when you drink, you don't know
your own strength.

23:26.484 --> 23:27.753
This is ridiculous.

23:27.777 --> 23:29.785
Can't you see
this is a performance?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.787
Mrs. Van De Kamp,
I've heard enough.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.089
Clearly, this environment is
a highly dysfunctional one.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.730
Andrew has retained my services

23:35.754 --> 23:39.124
in order to pursue
a healthier living situation.

23:39.148 --> 23:40.726
And what might that be?

23:40.750 --> 23:43.429
I, um, I wanna be emancipated.

23:43.453 --> 23:44.800
Emancipated?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.141
As an emancipated minor,
Andrew would be able

23:47.165 --> 23:48.634
to live on his own.

23:48.658 --> 23:50.576
He'd still go to school,
of course,

23:50.600 --> 23:52.578
but he'd be released
from all adult supervision.

23:52.602 --> 23:56.682
Well, that's the silliest thing
I've ever heard of.

23:56.706 --> 23:58.514
How would he support himself?

23:58.538 --> 24:01.638
Well, he'd be in complete
control of his own finances.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.661
So that's what this is about...
Your trust fund?

24:07.685 --> 24:10.025
Obviously, we'd all prefer

24:10.049 --> 24:13.028
not to go to family court,

24:13.052 --> 24:16.932
but with the violence
and your d.U.I. Charge,

24:16.956 --> 24:19.034
it could get ugly.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.906
Uh, Mr. Bormanis,

24:20.930 --> 24:23.438
I'll need a little time
to think about this.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.902
You have 24 hours.

24:33.743 --> 24:37.923
Boy, it really looks
like we're having a good time.

24:37.947 --> 24:39.855
I sure hope this works.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.558
Well, as long as they don't
make me play guitar,

24:42.582 --> 24:45.130
I think we're home free.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.694
Mr. and Mrs. Solis,
rhoda can see you now.

24:51.721 --> 24:53.221
Yes, thank you.

24:59.999 --> 25:04.780
Wow! It looks like you spend
lots of time with these kids.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.891
Oh, we take our roles
as godparents very seriously.

25:06.915 --> 25:09.054
Don't we, honey? Mm-hmm. Yes.

25:09.078 --> 25:12.008
Oh, they're precious.
What are their names?

25:14.584 --> 25:17.623
Parker and, uh...

25:17.647 --> 25:20.696
Porter, uh...

25:20.720 --> 25:22.798
And, uh...

25:23.953 --> 25:26.972
Well, they're all p's.
It is super cute.

25:26.996 --> 25:30.175
One sec. Do you need me, Helen?

25:30.199 --> 25:32.578
Hello, Gabrielle.

25:32.602 --> 25:33.632
Carlos.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.305
I didn't know you were adopting.

25:40.109 --> 25:41.747
Preston!

25:41.771 --> 25:44.850
The other one's name is Preston.

25:44.874 --> 25:47.923
Helen, you work here?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.696
You all know each other?
What a small world.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.997
It sure is.

25:52.021 --> 25:55.230
Mrs. Solis hired my son
to do her yard work.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.804
And also, she would rape him.

25:58.828 --> 26:00.836
Okay, first of all,
it was statutory,

26:00.860 --> 26:03.068
and it happened so long ago.

26:03.092 --> 26:05.619
Was it? I think
it was only about a year ago.

26:05.643 --> 26:07.813
No, itwasa year,

26:07.837 --> 26:10.816
because it was right before
your husband went to prison

26:10.840 --> 26:12.718
on slave labor charges.

26:12.742 --> 26:14.720
Rhoda, if you don't mind,

26:14.744 --> 26:17.331
I think I'll handle
the solis case myself.

26:17.355 --> 26:20.586
I'd like to make it
my top priority. Okay.

26:20.610 --> 26:23.859
Oh, and, um, Gabrielle,
don't bother trying to contact

26:23.883 --> 26:25.870
any other adoption agencies
in the area.

26:25.894 --> 26:28.915
I'll make sure
they knowallabout you.

26:41.270 --> 26:43.178
I think I have
to break up with Dr. Ron.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.810
What? Why?

26:44.834 --> 26:46.952
Because he's a gem.

26:46.976 --> 26:48.654
And apparently he loves me.

26:48.678 --> 26:50.886
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.888
Lynette, he is everything

26:52.912 --> 26:54.890
I could possibly want
in a boyfriend,

26:54.914 --> 26:58.593
and I just don't know
if I feel that...

26:58.617 --> 26:59.594
Spark.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.596
You know, and I really want to.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.599
Aw, sweetie. And he keeps
telling me how special I am

27:04.623 --> 27:06.601
and how much I mean to him...

27:06.625 --> 27:09.604
How he wants to hold
my beating heart in his hand.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.676
Ew.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.177
Mm.

27:12.201 --> 27:13.679
Maybe it's because

27:13.703 --> 27:15.786
I just haven't
felt that thunderbolt yet.

27:15.810 --> 27:18.784
You know, with Mike, it hit me.
With Karl, it his me.

27:18.808 --> 27:20.786
I didn't have to worry
about how I felt

27:20.810 --> 27:22.988
because the thunderbolt told me.

27:23.012 --> 27:25.991
Yeah, yeah.
Gotta love the thunderbolt.

27:26.015 --> 27:28.623
Do I, though? I mean,
I do. Mm-hmm.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.625
But I don't trust it anymore.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.128
You know, those relationships
turned out to be disasters.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.931
Maybe I should
stick it out with Dr. Ron,

27:35.955 --> 27:38.664
and I should try heading down
a road that's growing and slower

27:38.688 --> 27:40.666
into a sort of kind of love

27:40.690 --> 27:43.709
that would sustain itself
for 50 years. Right?

27:43.733 --> 27:47.172
Stability, comfort, endurance...
I deserve that.

27:47.196 --> 27:49.866
Oh, yes! Of course you do.

27:51.841 --> 27:54.820
Still, you gotta love
the thunderbolt.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.281
That's not helpful.

27:56.305 --> 27:57.305
Sorry.

27:58.908 --> 28:00.385
Ah, this is a sign.

28:00.409 --> 28:02.027
Will you shut up?

28:02.051 --> 28:04.730
We lost a baby, found out
we can't conceive another one,

28:04.754 --> 28:07.698
and ran into Helen rowland
at an adoption agency.

28:07.722 --> 28:09.735
God is obviously
trying to tell us something.

28:09.759 --> 28:12.738
Carlos, we're catholics, okay?
God is pretty Johnny one note

28:12.762 --> 28:14.740
on the whole subject
of procreation.

28:14.764 --> 28:16.681
Hey, and will you stop
with this defeatist attitude?

28:16.705 --> 28:18.944
Okay, do you want a baby or not?

28:18.968 --> 28:21.777
I think it's time that we faced
reality... we're bad people,

28:21.801 --> 28:23.779
and we probably don't
even deserve to be parents.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.181
Well, then who the hell does?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.683
I mean, look at all the idiots
popping kids.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.787
Okay, they're not any more
qualified than we are.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.859
I don't know.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.290
Look, Carlos...

28:35.314 --> 28:37.768
It doesn't matter
what we've done in our past.

28:37.792 --> 28:40.025
Being a parent
means rising to the occasion,

28:40.049 --> 28:42.027
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do when

28:42.051 --> 28:44.299
we bring our baby home.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.301
This is the first time

28:46.325 --> 28:49.204
I really felt like
you wanted to have a baby.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.977
Well, this is the first time

28:52.001 --> 28:54.001
someone told me
I couldn't have one.

28:59.308 --> 29:01.847
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

29:01.871 --> 29:04.719
I mean, no adoption agency
is gonna touch us now.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.193
There are ways
to get babies, Carlos.

29:08.217 --> 29:09.747
It just might cost us.

29:13.783 --> 29:16.206
I have some contacts
in the police department.

29:16.230 --> 29:18.203
I've been making calls,
but I can't seem to get

29:18.227 --> 29:20.866
a straight answer
about your dad.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.868
I don't understand.
How do they just lose somebody?

29:22.892 --> 29:24.870
They don't, not by accident.

29:24.894 --> 29:27.848
But I don't think what happened
to your dad was an accident.

29:27.872 --> 29:29.144
What's that supposed to mean?

29:30.940 --> 29:32.140
Zach!

29:33.502 --> 29:34.950
Mrs. Tillman.

29:34.974 --> 29:39.785
Hello, Zachary.
You look terrible.

29:39.809 --> 29:41.756
Oh, Mr. Delfino.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.889
Isn't this just a picture?

29:43.913 --> 29:46.361
Felicia, why are you here?

29:46.385 --> 29:48.033
Young Zachary
and I didn't exactly part

29:48.057 --> 29:50.395
on the best of terms.

29:50.419 --> 29:53.038
In fact,
when the weather's damp,

29:53.062 --> 29:55.841
I'm still reminded
of our last good-bye.

29:55.865 --> 29:59.845
But forgive and forget.
That's my motto.

29:59.869 --> 30:01.169
Macaroon?

30:38.137 --> 30:40.285
Dad!

30:40.309 --> 30:41.939
You all right?

30:53.422 --> 30:56.932
Now how did you know
I love macaroons?

31:09.969 --> 31:12.948
It won't end here, you know.
Noah Taylor doesn't give up.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.080
Look, don't worry about us.
We'll be gone by morning.

31:15.104 --> 31:17.087
No, it's too late for that now.

31:17.111 --> 31:20.085
I guarantee he's got people watching
you. What is it with you anyway?

31:20.109 --> 31:22.587
First, you want me to run.
Now you want us

31:22.611 --> 31:24.859
to stick around like
sitting ducks for this maniac.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.997
Go ahead, run. Noah's got
the cops in his pocket.

31:27.021 --> 31:30.395
What do you think's gonna happen
the first time you try

31:30.419 --> 31:33.989
to buy gas with a credit card or
open a new bank account?

31:35.494 --> 31:37.973
So I'm a dead man.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.105
Maybe not.

31:40.129 --> 31:42.607
Not if we use
what leverage we have.

31:42.631 --> 31:44.079
No way.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.081
The old man's gonna be dead

31:46.105 --> 31:48.083
in a couple of months,
maybe less.

31:48.107 --> 31:52.187
Let him meet Zach, play the
doting grandfather... I said forget it.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.011
I'll do it.

31:55.945 --> 31:58.363
If it means
he'll leave us alone,

31:58.387 --> 32:00.617
I'm ready to be leveraged.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.303
Nicholson will be coming in

32:08.327 --> 32:10.305
in about 15 minutes
with a pitch,

32:10.329 --> 32:12.237
so let's grab everybody

32:12.261 --> 32:14.261
and make sure
we're all on the same page.

32:15.965 --> 32:19.065
Hang on a second.

32:21.110 --> 32:23.388
What's going on?

32:23.412 --> 32:25.620
I need to say this.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.952
Ah, yeah...

32:26.976 --> 32:29.955
I have been giving you
a lot of grief lately

32:29.979 --> 32:31.456
about being the boss.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.959
But it's just
hard for a guy to feel like

32:33.983 --> 32:36.506
he's not in charge
of any part of his life.

32:36.530 --> 32:39.404
But, honey,
it goes back and forth. I know.

32:39.428 --> 32:41.406
But it just feels
a little one-sided lately,

32:41.430 --> 32:44.970
and sometimes
I need to drive the train.

32:44.994 --> 32:47.372
But, look,
I know it is my issue.

32:47.396 --> 32:49.074
It's my issue,

32:49.098 --> 32:51.738
and I will step up
and deal with it.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.555
Mmm.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.387
Whoa. Hello.

33:02.411 --> 33:04.389
What's going on, huh?

33:04.413 --> 33:06.400
I'm picking up where
we left off. Hmm?

33:06.424 --> 33:07.662
Last night.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.635
Oh, I get it. I get it.

33:10.659 --> 33:13.468
Ooh! This is your idea
of driving the train.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.569
Mm-hmm.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.972
And it's very manly
and really impressive,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.996
but it's really, really
bad timing.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.372
You can't be serious.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.084
Mmm. We're gonna...
We're gonna be late.

33:29.108 --> 33:33.138
Yeah, we are going to be late.

33:38.087 --> 33:39.294
Okay.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.527
There is nothing
more important than family.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.529
And I think it's so unfair
some are denied

33:44.553 --> 33:46.040
their god-given right to parent

33:46.064 --> 33:50.004
just because of a few
sordid incidents in their past.

33:50.028 --> 33:54.008
Now I may have to explore
some unconventional paths

33:54.032 --> 33:55.480
to find your child.

33:55.504 --> 33:58.591
I might even have to take action
some might view as unsavory.

33:58.615 --> 34:02.187
But before I do...

34:02.211 --> 34:04.389
I need proof that the two of you

34:04.413 --> 34:07.723
are prepared to face
the challenges ahead.

34:13.722 --> 34:17.161
$20,000.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.434
Is that proof enough for you?

34:19.458 --> 34:22.558
Yes, it is.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.155
Nice to meet you, young man.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.487
I'm not gonna hug you.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.789
I don't care
if you are my grandfather.

34:44.813 --> 34:49.234
Ah. That's okay.
Hugging's not really my thing.

34:49.257 --> 34:50.795
Mike, could you wait outside?

34:50.819 --> 34:52.797
I'd like to be alone
with Zachary.

34:52.821 --> 34:56.070
Not a chance.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.243
Just curious...

34:58.267 --> 35:00.375
Why was it so important
you see me?

35:00.399 --> 35:02.607
You're my grandson.

35:02.631 --> 35:05.210
My flesh and blood.

35:05.234 --> 35:08.388
Isn't it only natural I'd want
a relationship with you?

35:08.412 --> 35:10.385
What kind of relationship
can we have

35:10.409 --> 35:12.387
when I know you tried
to kill my dad?

35:12.411 --> 35:15.260
Surely, you can understand

35:15.284 --> 35:17.767
the rage I must feel
towards your father.

35:17.791 --> 35:20.265
Go ahead. Feel all the rage
you wanna feel.

35:20.289 --> 35:22.267
But if anything happens to him,

35:22.291 --> 35:25.200
I swear to god you are never
gonna see me again.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.532
You only met me two minutes ago,

35:27.556 --> 35:31.876
and here you are,
already blackmailing me.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.738
I couldn't be prouder.

35:33.762 --> 35:35.240
I'm serious.

35:35.264 --> 35:38.251
I want you to swear you're not
gonna do anything to my dad.

35:38.275 --> 35:40.245
Which dad?

35:40.269 --> 35:42.269
You have two of 'em.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.624
You know who I'm talking about...

35:49.648 --> 35:51.626
My dad, the man who raised me,

35:51.650 --> 35:53.720
the only man
I'm ever gonna care about.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.555
So swear.

35:59.228 --> 36:00.865
I swear.

36:00.889 --> 36:03.838
Well, now that
the ground rules have been set,

36:03.862 --> 36:06.842
who's up for some
meaningless small talk?

36:25.814 --> 36:27.841
Well, if it isn't the plumber.

36:27.865 --> 36:29.434
You here to see Susan?

36:29.458 --> 36:32.437
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk
to her before her operation.

36:32.461 --> 36:34.439
Oh?
You're cutting it kinda close.

36:34.463 --> 36:36.446
She's just about
to be wheeled into surgery.

36:36.470 --> 36:38.503
You know,
she's dating her surgeon.

36:38.527 --> 36:40.367
Yeah, she told me.

36:42.271 --> 36:43.748
You met him?

36:43.772 --> 36:46.211
Yeah. He's, like, 6 years old.

36:47.236 --> 36:49.254
Those for her?

36:49.278 --> 36:52.186
Yeah. The florist
was having a sale on lilacs.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.219
Dr. Ron just bought her

36:54.243 --> 36:56.830
the biggest bouquet of roses
you've ever seen.

36:56.854 --> 36:58.393
It was disgusting.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.825
And the note that went with it
made my teeth hurt,

37:00.849 --> 37:02.327
it was so saccharin.

37:02.351 --> 37:05.830
He used words like
"soul mate" and "eternity."

37:05.854 --> 37:07.902
I almost puked in the vase.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.335
What'd Susan think about that?

37:10.359 --> 37:14.799
Well, she seemed
to be really into it.

37:19.768 --> 37:20.745
Mike!

37:20.769 --> 37:22.747
Oh, wait, stop! Go back!

37:22.771 --> 37:24.989
Stop! Stop a second.

37:25.013 --> 37:28.823
Hey! What are you doing here?

37:28.847 --> 37:32.226
I just, uh, wanted to wish
you luck before your surgery.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.500
Aw, that's so sweet.

37:35.524 --> 37:38.341
You came all the way
down here just for me.

37:38.365 --> 37:41.336
Yep. That's why I came.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.469
Oh, it means
a lot to me that you came.

37:44.493 --> 37:47.412
Well, you take care, Susan.

37:47.436 --> 37:48.436
Okay.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.468
Bye.

37:54.843 --> 37:57.522
You forgot
to give her your flowers.

37:57.546 --> 38:01.446
Ah, it's no big deal.

38:06.555 --> 38:08.793
Hi, Susan. How are those drugs
working for you?

38:08.817 --> 38:10.295
You feeling good?

38:10.319 --> 38:13.368
Super-duper. How you feeling?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.700
Well, um,
you know I want you to know,

38:15.724 --> 38:17.602
what I said the other day...

38:17.626 --> 38:20.274
That corny stuff about me
holding your heart in my hands...

38:21.700 --> 38:23.778
Well, what I meant to say was,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.651
my feelings for you...
They keep growing,

38:26.675 --> 38:29.454
and, uh, I think...

38:29.478 --> 38:32.387
Well, I hope that you feel
the same way about me. Mm.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.059
Ah, hell, Susan.

38:35.083 --> 38:36.721
I love you.

38:36.745 --> 38:41.766
Aw, thank you.

38:41.790 --> 38:44.969
I love Mike.

38:44.993 --> 38:46.371
Mike?

38:46.395 --> 38:48.573
Susan, who's Mike?

38:48.597 --> 38:52.527
Mike is love. Mmm.

38:54.603 --> 38:56.841
Who the hell is Mike?

38:56.865 --> 38:59.644
I don't know, but she's married
to a guy named Karl.

38:59.668 --> 39:03.388
I'm so, so sorry.
I should've told you, Dr. Ron.

39:03.412 --> 39:05.990
Mmm, Mike, Mike, Mike...

39:06.014 --> 39:09.401
Oh, why are you always
falling in love with skanks?

39:09.425 --> 39:11.456
You beautiful, beautiful man!

39:11.480 --> 39:13.550
Oh!

39:18.557 --> 39:23.438
Okay, we ready to go here?

39:23.462 --> 39:24.792
Yeah. Sure.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.035
Let's cut this bitch open.

39:37.546 --> 39:39.854
What are you doing?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.856
Your lawyer left a message
on my machine.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.389
It seems we have
a hearing in four weeks,

39:44.413 --> 39:46.391
and I wanna be ready.

39:46.415 --> 39:47.892
Oh, I get it.

39:47.916 --> 39:50.565
So, uh, so you're gonna pretend
to be sober for the judge?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.397
Oh, there's no pretending.

39:52.421 --> 39:56.801
I am going to my first
a.A. Meeting tomorrow.

39:56.825 --> 39:59.504
Of course, I picked one
in the worst part of town

39:59.528 --> 40:01.506
so I won't
run into anybody I know.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.508
Which, of course, means I will.

40:03.532 --> 40:07.111
All right, so what
is that gonna prove?

40:07.135 --> 40:08.913
Perception is reality, Andrew.

40:08.937 --> 40:11.416
And if people perceive me
to have a drinking problem,

40:11.440 --> 40:12.917
then I do.

40:12.941 --> 40:14.919
And I certainly don't want
some idiotic judge

40:14.943 --> 40:18.523
using my hobby as an excuse
to make you rich.

40:18.547 --> 40:21.395
So I'm simply
going to give up my wine

40:21.419 --> 40:25.470
and become
a recovering alcoholic.

40:25.494 --> 40:28.833
Good plan, but it'll never work.

40:28.857 --> 40:32.907
See, I'll bet you still
end up coming to court hammered.

40:34.102 --> 40:36.080
Oh, Andrew, you don't think
I love you enough

40:36.104 --> 40:37.944
to give up alcohol?

40:39.468 --> 40:41.516
Look, I'm 17, all right?

40:41.540 --> 40:44.449
So you can only keep me here
for another year.

40:44.473 --> 40:46.751
Why not just let me go?

40:46.775 --> 40:49.423
Because I'm not
done with you yet.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.425
It's my job to teach you,

40:51.449 --> 40:53.558
and you are not half the man
I know you can be.

40:53.582 --> 40:55.460
Yeah, well, I got news for you...

40:55.484 --> 40:57.467
This is as good
as I'm gonna get.

40:57.491 --> 40:59.033
If I really thought that,

40:59.057 --> 41:01.435
I'd get a gun right now
and kill us both.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.937
Mom, we're both so unhappy.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.039
Why not just
let me take my trust fund,

41:05.063 --> 41:07.450
and I'll get
out of your hair forever?

41:07.474 --> 41:08.565
Please.

41:13.542 --> 41:16.042
You're a stone cold bitch,
you know that?

41:25.584 --> 41:28.524
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite catch that.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.467
I hate you.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.642
You know, the opposite
of love isn't hate.

41:37.666 --> 41:39.143
It's indifference.

41:39.167 --> 41:42.547
And if you hate me,
that means you still care,

41:42.571 --> 41:44.979
and we're still connected,

41:45.003 --> 41:48.683
and I still have a chance
to set you right.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.892
This is how Bree Van De Kamp

41:57.916 --> 42:01.065
finally came to change
her weekly routine.

42:01.089 --> 42:05.570
She still cleaned on Tuesdays...

42:05.594 --> 42:08.873
Paid her bills on wednesdays...

42:08.897 --> 42:12.506
And did her laundry
on Thursdays.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.008
But her Fridays

42:14.032 --> 42:16.942
were now reserved
for a meeting...

42:18.667 --> 42:19.944
A special meeting

42:19.968 --> 42:23.588
where she stood in front
of people she didn't know...

42:23.612 --> 42:28.593
My name is Bree,
and I am an alcoholic.

42:28.617 --> 42:31.617
And said things
she didn't believe.

42:34.623 --> 42:36.610
And afterwards,
Bree would come home

42:36.634 --> 42:40.264
and reward herself...

42:40.288 --> 42:43.288
On the completion
of another successful week.
