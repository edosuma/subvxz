WEBVTT

00:06.280 --> 00:09.560
You have fought
with valour and courage,...

00:09.720 --> 00:11.720
..sacrificed for each other,...

00:11.880 --> 00:13.800
..for this country,...

00:13.960 --> 00:15.880
..for this planet.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.920
To honour the men
and women of the SGC,...

00:19.080 --> 00:20.920
..I present Arthur Simms,...

00:21.600 --> 00:25.200
..the Secretary of Defense
of the United States of America.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.080
Since the re-inception of this programme,
I have eagerly awaited...

00:37.240 --> 00:41.640
..every word of every mission report
stemming from this base...

00:41.800 --> 00:46.480
..like a wide-eyed child
waiting for his next bedtime story.

00:46.640 --> 00:52.200
Not actually being here, seeing your faces
or this Stargate here behind me,...

00:52.360 --> 00:56.320
..it is sometimes easy to forget
that it's all really happening.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.640
The President regrets
not being able to be here.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.920
But I'm glad because
it gives me the opportunity...

01:03.080 --> 01:07.440
..to congratulate you on your effort
in defeating a formidable enemy...

01:07.600 --> 01:11.080
..and rescuing SG-1
captured in the line of duty.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.480
You risk your lives every day
in a way more dangerous and fantastic...

01:15.640 --> 01:17.920
..than any of us could have ever dreamed.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.040
Understand that I represent
every person of this great nation...

01:23.200 --> 01:26.560
..when I salute your ongoing heroic spirit.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.080
You should be proud.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.960
Before we finish today,...

01:35.120 --> 01:39.080
..l have one other small bit of business.
Please come to attention.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.120
From the Vice Chief of Staff
of the Air Force,...

01:47.280 --> 01:51.920
..in recognition of Captain
Samantha Carter's outstanding work,...

01:52.080 --> 01:56.080
..I hereby authorise her immediate
promotion to the rank of major.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.800
Captain, step forward.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.039
The United States Air Force recognises
that you have fulfilled tasks and duties...

02:09.199 --> 02:12.200
..well beyond
the responsibility of captain.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.080
It is with great pleasure
that I bestow upon you...

02:18.240 --> 02:22.480
..the responsibilities,
the respect and the rank of major.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.560
Thank you, sir.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.400
Well done... Major.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.480
(applause)

02:34.840 --> 02:38.720
In closing, Major Carter's supervisor,
Colonel Jack O'Neill,...

02:38.880 --> 02:40.800
..would like to say a few words.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.880
Normally, I am a man of very few words.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.800
Code Nine!

02:58.560 --> 03:00.480
- (alarm)
- Let's go!

03:04.200 --> 03:07.040
(O'Neill)
And in conclusion I'd like to say...

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.960 --> 03:45.800
Greetings, Jack O'Neill.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.880
Greetings.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.000
- Have we met?
- I am Thor.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.560
I apologise for taking you by surprise,...

05:04.160 --> 05:06.320
..but this is a matter of great importance.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.680
We're in orbit around Earth, right?

05:08.840 --> 05:09.960
Yes.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.720
We have satellites and telescopes
that can see spaceships.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.800
We have never been detected
in orbit around Earth before.

05:18.920 --> 05:19.840
Hm.

05:20.840 --> 05:25.160
All right. I'm sorry.
You were saying something.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.080
A matter of great importance?

05:28.240 --> 05:32.200
We heard what transpired with your
people and the Goa'uld named Hathor.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.920
- She had it coming.
- As a result,...

05:35.040 --> 05:37.840
..the Goa'uld System Lords
have turned towards you.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.040
What, for killing Hathor?

05:40.200 --> 05:43.760
They should be thanking us.
She was planning to overthrow them.

05:43.920 --> 05:48.560
Her intentions are irrelevant. Earth has
again proven to be a formidable threat...

05:48.720 --> 05:51.800
- ..to the Goa'uld.
- Oh, now, we're a threat to them?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.640
They have decided
it is a concern to be dealt with.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.960
The System Lords can launch an assault
one hundred times more powerful...

05:59.120 --> 06:03.480
..than that which you previously
withstood at the hands of Apophis.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.360
OK. Uh...

06:05.520 --> 06:08.840
- That could be a problem.
- The Asgard agree.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.160
I have come to offer our assistance.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.760
That would be appreciated.
I've seen your work. It's great.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.880
The majority of the Asgard fleet
is currently unavailable.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.560
Oh.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.520
- So what d'you have in mind?
- With your permission,...

06:26.680 --> 06:30.360
..the Asgard will try to negotiate
with the Goa'uld System Lords...

06:30.520 --> 06:34.720
..to include Earth
in the Protected Planets Treaty.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.320
- That's a good thing, right?
- It would prevent this attack.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.480
Good. Uh...

06:43.640 --> 06:47.040
To be honest with you,
I'd rather have a fleet of your ships.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.680
A few of these babies and we could just...

06:53.880 --> 06:57.000
We... could try the negotiating thing.

06:57.160 --> 07:02.680
I will contact the System Lords.
You may return to your planet now.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.720
Excuse me?

07:12.480 --> 07:16.240
I assume someone's
gonna show me the way back.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.240
Thank you!

07:23.160 --> 07:26.080
Why would the Goa'uld
agree to this negotiation?

07:26.240 --> 07:28.160
The Goa'uld fear the Asgard.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.600
The Asgard must be offering something
in return. That's how negotiations work.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.400
Well, what if the summit fails?

07:35.560 --> 07:40.480
Thor said that was the only option
he could offer. If it fails,...

07:40.640 --> 07:42.680
..total annihilation.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.600
The President is wondering
whether we can trust the Asgard.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.960
- The Tok'ra trust them.
- They helped Jack...

07:50.120 --> 07:52.720
..when the ancients' language
entered his brain.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.800
You gotta love 'em for that.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.960
But what about their politics? How do
we know they have our interests at heart?

08:00.480 --> 08:04.440
I suppose we don't. But if they have
any other agenda in mind...

08:08.840 --> 08:11.400
Colonel, do we need Security?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.080
No, I'll vouch for him, sir.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.240
Major Samantha Carter.
Dr Daniel Jackson. You remember Thor.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.520
Thor, this is Teal'c.

08:26.680 --> 08:31.520
And Major General George Hammond.
He's the leader of our facility here.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.000
The System Lords
have agreed to negotiate.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.960
- That's good news.
- They will arrive in four days.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.200
- Here?
- It is customary...

08:43.360 --> 08:46.640
..for such negotiations
to be held on the planet in question.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.280
Three representatives
will arrive by Stargate.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.720
You must speak on behalf of
all the inhabitants of Earth.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.320
Uh, well... maybe not me, personally.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.680
We have chosen you, O'Neill,
to represent Earth at the proceedings.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.520
Now, see, that could be a mistake.

09:06.120 --> 09:10.400
You see, Dr Jackson here is an
extremely educated and articulate man.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.280
- Fluent in every language.
- You led your people...

09:13.440 --> 09:17.440
..through the Stargate.
You are our choice, O'Neill.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.320
Further instructions
to aid you in preparation will follow.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.200
Well,...

09:29.200 --> 09:31.480
..there you go.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.520
Cronus, an early Greek god,
was one of 1 2 Titans...

09:34.680 --> 09:38.280
..who eventually
ascended to supreme domination.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.640
He was god of Fate and became father
to Zeus, Hera, Poseidon and Hades.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.840
This may indicate a connection
to the Goa'uld Sokar.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.360
Cronus is the most influential
of the System Lords.

09:49.520 --> 09:55.000
It was he who originally banished Sokar.
He was also a mortal enemy of Apophis.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.280
Maybe that's why the System Lords
didn't join in Apophis' attack on Earth.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.160
The System Lords
reluctantly banded together...

10:02.320 --> 10:05.560
..against outside threats
like the Asgard and the Reetou.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.720
However, they still battle amongst
themselves for their own domains.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.080
The second Goa'uld representative
we're expecting is...

10:13.240 --> 10:15.280
..Yu.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.440
- Me?
- Yu is the name of the Goa'uld.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.800
Ah. Sorry.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.200
Also known as Yu the Great.
He was not a god per se,...

10:26.360 --> 10:29.640
..but may have been
one of China's earliest emperors.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.840
Legend says he had great mythic powers
and sprang from a dragon's body.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.320
He founded the first recorded dynasty,...

10:38.480 --> 10:40.920
..whose advances came about
under harsh rule.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.480
But Yu did account for
a number of positive influences.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.880
Thank you.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.240
Sorry.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.880
According to Thor,
Yu is the most likely to favour this treaty...

10:54.040 --> 10:56.640
..as his interests no longer reside here.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.920
And the third Goa'uld, Dr Jackson?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.760
Another one we haven't met
but have a familiarity with.

11:06.200 --> 11:11.320
Nirrti is the Goa'uld who wiped out
all but one survivor of P8X-987...

11:11.480 --> 11:16.680
..along with four members of the SGC
in an attempt to destroy Earth's Stargate.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.920
Cassandra's planet.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.920
Little is known about Nirrti on Earth.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.360
In early Hindu reference she was
a destructive goddess of Darkness.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.600
So we're gonna let these Goa'uld
just walk in here?

11:29.760 --> 11:34.080
There are a number of aspects
of this situation I'm not comfortable with.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.920
Thank you, Dr Jackson.

11:40.560 --> 11:44.840
Teal'c, I would like you to act
as liaison to the Goa'uld. Dr Jackson...

11:45.000 --> 11:47.920
- General Hammond...
- Is there a problem?

11:48.080 --> 11:50.000
I mean no disrespect,...

11:50.160 --> 11:55.680
..but I have given my allegiance to you,
to the SGC, and to the people here, freely.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.040
I will, however, not see to
the petty needs of these Goa'uld.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.280
I'll see to the petty needs
of the Goa'uld, sir.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.520
OK, Dr Jackson.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.080
Teal'c, you will assist Major Castleman
with base security.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.560
Treaty laws will not permit weapons...

12:14.720 --> 12:17.760
..of any kind in this facility
during negotiations.

12:17.920 --> 12:22.080
Whoa! Sir, that doesn't sound wise.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.840
We're trusting the Asgard
based on your word.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.760
This is their rule. As a result, the base is
completely sealed off from the surface.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.200
The Secretary of Defense
will represent the President.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.400
Storage room 1 2A on level 17 will be used
as a meeting room for security reasons.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.080
You've all received folders
that include your assignments...

12:42.240 --> 12:45.440
..and preparation instructions
as laid out by the Asgard.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.760
There's a lot of work to do, people,
and not much time.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.840
What about that one, Major?

13:07.800 --> 13:11.440
This is a Goa'uld healing device.
Those two are the weapons.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.160
- General!
- Colonel, how are your briefings going?

13:22.320 --> 13:25.640
I had no idea how exciting
diplomacy could be, sir.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.160
- What's this about?
- I'm not sure. It's Teal'c.

13:29.320 --> 13:33.320
- Sergeant, what's the problem?
- He won't relinquish his weapon, sir.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.200
Teal'c?

13:36.360 --> 13:39.600
Like you, I do not believe
we should remove all weapons.

13:39.760 --> 13:44.120
The Asgard were explicit. If they
detect weapons, there will be no summit.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.960
No summit, no treaty.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.440
These Goa'uld are among the most
treacherous that I have ever known.

13:50.600 --> 13:54.480
Thor assures us the Goa'ulds are
also forbidden from bringing weapons.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.200
No treaty, and they're gonna send
a hundred mother ships here.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.600
You know as well as I do
what that means.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.360
Teal'c, I order you
to turn your weapon over.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.360
Checkpoints are being sealed.
Levels 3 through 28 are now offlimits.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.800
Go, go, go, go!

14:24.040 --> 14:25.960
Move! Move!

14:48.040 --> 14:50.600
Chevron 7 is locked. Off-world activation.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.840
Here we are. The VIP room.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.800
That's an acronym
that means "very important".

15:29.960 --> 15:31.880
I hope this is OK.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.760
(distorted)
Your idea of accommodation is pitiful.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.320
- It's the best...
- (distorted) We will not stand for this!

15:49.880 --> 15:51.800
What is this about?

15:54.960 --> 15:58.440
- Shol'va!
- Onak holka shaka!

15:58.600 --> 16:01.760
Treena arik croonaka shol'va.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.680
What's going on?

16:06.840 --> 16:10.920
(distorted) Your surveillance devices
were poorly hidden in our quarters.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.000
They weren't hidden.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.440
They're security cameras
for your own safety.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.520
As I was trying to explain.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.600
- I will not be spied upon!
- Nor will l.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.880
No offence was meant.
It's merely a security precaution.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.040
I'll ask if we can remove the cameras
from the rooms, but not from the halls.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.640
Do not show your face
to me again, shol'va.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.720
Kelmar tokeem.

16:53.200 --> 16:57.440
As First Prime of Apophis, I often
did battle with the Jaffa of Cronus.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.800
You must have battled
lots of rival Goa'ulds.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.400
That looked a little more personal to me.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.560
My father was once
First Prime of Cronus.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.920
When I was but a child,...

17:20.079 --> 17:24.560
..Cronus commanded my father to attack
a Goa'uld who was more powerful.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.119
It was an impossible battle to win.

17:30.640 --> 17:36.080
When all was inevitably lost,
Cronus killed my father as punishment...

17:36.840 --> 17:39.280
..and exiled my mother and l.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.360
We fled to Chulak.

17:42.720 --> 17:46.080
I vowed I would become
the strongest Jaffa I could,...

17:46.240 --> 17:49.600
..so one day I would be named
First Prime of Apophis,...

17:50.520 --> 17:52.440
..sworn enemy of Cronus.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.440
I trust our guests are settled.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.280
They demanded the security cameras
be removed from their quarters.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.640
I assume you told them no.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.840
Actually, sir,
I kind of told them it would be OK.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.400
I told them we'd have to leave them
in the halls. Sort of a... compromise.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.480
- If you think it's absolutely necessary.
- Yes.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.520
- Are you gonna be OK?
- I will.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.400
I just wanted to wish you luck, sir.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.480
Thank you, Captain. Major.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.000
- Nervous?
- I wouldn't call it nervous.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.920
Confused.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.000
I have no idea why I'm here.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.960
The Asgard have confidence in you,
as do the rest of us.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.760
- I know I couldn't do it.
- Why?

18:52.920 --> 18:57.000
I didn't want to say anything because
I wasn't sure until I saw his face,...

18:57.160 --> 19:01.560
..but I think Cronus is the one
who sent the Ashrak to kill Jolinar.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.640
I just hate having them here.

19:04.720 --> 19:08.520
Major, I hate having 'em anywhere.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.720
Oops.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.440
Good luck.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.720
Hello. Come on in.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.800
Have a seat. Thank you, Dr Jackson.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.800
Hello, Yu.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.640
Well, I guess we're just, uh...

19:39.560 --> 19:41.480
And here he is.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.280
The gang's all here.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.840
You all know each other.
I guess we can get started.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.200
The Asgard High Council
wishes you all greetings and thanks...

19:52.360 --> 19:54.960
..for this opportunity
to negotiate for peace.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.720
The Goa'uld System Lords
are prepared to hear the Asgard proposal.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.840
- Onak arik kree.
- Koracca aseemu!

20:05.920 --> 20:09.000
Kornak kree! Keena arik Asgard.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.000
I thought we were gonna speak
the same language.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.320
Gonach!

20:20.560 --> 20:22.480
What?

20:25.360 --> 20:27.680
- What'd I say?
- You insulted them.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.640
- I insulted them?
- By speaking out of turn.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.800
This was to be expected.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.880
They were yelling at each other
before I said a word!

20:39.040 --> 20:43.440
They have a fragile relationship
with one another, as do we with them.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.920
You mean they're always like that?

20:46.080 --> 20:49.960
Excuse me. Sorry for interrupting.
What just happened?

20:50.120 --> 20:54.440
Apparently, we said hello,
insulted each other, and broke for recess.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.120
Can I ask you something?

20:59.720 --> 21:03.120
Why did you let the Goa'uld
get that much power in the first place?

21:03.280 --> 21:05.200
If you've got the technology...

21:05.360 --> 21:10.000
We are not proud that we have been
forced to ignore the situation for so long.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.040
But you must understand,
there are other concerns for the Asgard.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.720
We have an enemy in our home galaxy
that is far worse than the Goa'uld.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.200
- Worse?
- I cannot explain further.

21:22.360 --> 21:26.800
For now, we use what resources we can
to enforce these treaties with the Goa'uld.

21:26.960 --> 21:31.640
What if a rogue Goa'uld like Sokar, who's
been banished by the System Lords,...

21:31.800 --> 21:33.720
..decides to come after us?

21:33.880 --> 21:38.360
In order to maintain the treaty,
the System Lords would try to prevent it.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.840
Our greatest advantage
has been their feudal nature.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.880
Our greatest concern has been
a single Goa'uld rising to power.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.640
If Sokar were to overtake
the System Lords,...

21:48.800 --> 21:51.720
..the Asgard may not have
the power to stop him.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.880
So,...

21:54.040 --> 21:58.120
..basically, you guys
are bluffing the Goa'uld, big time.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.440
They've been so busy
badgering each other, they bought it?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.840
I must return to my ship now.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.040
It will take time before the System Lords
will be willing to reconvene.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.440
You may contact me with this.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.600
It will work as long as my ship is in orbit.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.440
- How?
- Hold it in your hand and speak.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.400
- Thanks.
- We appreciate what you're doing.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.640
These negotiations will not be easy.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.760
We will be required
to make great sacrifices.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.560
As will you.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.960
The fate of the world in my hands,
and I screw it up!

22:59.600 --> 23:01.680
I take it you apologised?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.160
Oh, I tried. They wouldn't see me.

23:05.280 --> 23:09.800
- (Hammond) What now?
- Daniel typed a formal letter in Goa'uld...

23:09.960 --> 23:13.600
..and I signed it. That boy can
really grovel when he has to.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.360
Must be part of their negotiating strategy.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.680
I hope so.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.520
Cos Thor made it pretty clear that we
might have to give up something... big.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.320
What if it's hosts?

23:27.480 --> 23:30.360
Well, that would be unacceptable,
wouldn't it?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.960
As you have said, O'Neill,
the alternative could be far worse.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.120
They're ready.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.240
We accept the apology
of the human representative...

23:56.480 --> 23:58.920
..and agree to hear the Asgard proposal.

23:59.960 --> 24:06.320
In return for Earth's part in the Protected
Planets Treaty, addendum 1081 5,...

24:06.480 --> 24:10.120
..the Asgard will allow Goa'uld
access to the Passage of Nilor.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.680
According to treaty law, section 326,...

24:14.600 --> 24:19.320
..no human planet will be allowed
to advance technologically to a point...

24:19.480 --> 24:21.960
..where they may be a threat
to the Goa'uld.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.520
- Correct.
- Definition of such threat...

24:25.680 --> 24:29.640
..shall rest solely in the hands
of the Goa'uld System Lords.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.840
What?!

24:34.520 --> 24:36.440
Sorry.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.040
- May I ask a question?
- The human representative is recognised.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.560
Thank you.

24:45.160 --> 24:48.200
Are you saying
you're limiting our development?

24:48.360 --> 24:51.560
The treaty recognises
that the human species...

24:51.720 --> 24:56.480
..exists for the purpose of serving
the Goa'uld as hosts and slaves.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.360
Excuse me?!

25:00.160 --> 25:03.800
(Thor) Do the System Lords
accept the Asgard proposal?

25:07.520 --> 25:10.080
The Goa'uld System Lords...

25:10.240 --> 25:12.160
..accept the Asgard proposal.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.040
We demand one additional concession.

25:17.360 --> 25:21.240
We order the immediate
and unconditional forfeiture...

25:21.400 --> 25:23.320
..of the Tauri Stargate.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.800
Both of them.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.360
Are we seriously
going to give up gate travel?

25:40.520 --> 25:42.480
Considering the alternative...

25:42.640 --> 25:46.080
That ring out there
is the most important thing on this planet.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.200
And I understand
what losing the gate would mean.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.920
But it is on your word
that we trust these Asgard.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.280
Peaceful solutions to this crisis
must be considered.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.480
- True, but...
- The point is, sir, with all due respect,...

25:59.640 --> 26:01.560
..it's not as simple as you put it.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.760
There are threats
this treaty will not protect you from.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.880
From what Thor says,
an enemy worse than the Goa'uld.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.520
If any of you can tell me absolutely...

26:11.680 --> 26:16.400
..why we should not accept this proposal,
I'll forward your opinion to the President.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.320
And I assure you
it will be given serious weight.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.080
Have your people reached a decision?

26:38.240 --> 26:39.760
Um...

26:40.720 --> 26:43.440
Not yet. That's kinda why I'm here.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.080
I was wondering
what you think we should do.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.120
It is your decision.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.280
I see.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.320
Or do l?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.880
You guys,...

27:03.680 --> 27:08.320
..do you ever say one thing and mean
another? Kinda speak between the lines?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.560
- I do not.
- Do not what?

27:11.720 --> 27:14.040
Speak between the lines or understand?

27:15.480 --> 27:18.840
What do you, O'Neill,
think your people should do?

27:19.000 --> 27:24.760
Well, I don't know. It's a bit much for one
guy to make that call for an entire planet.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.560
On the other hand, it's pretty obvious.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.280
Give up the Stargate or be destroyed.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.520
- So it would seem.
- But the Goa'uld could call your bluff,...

27:34.680 --> 27:38.880
..attack us anyway and we'd have
given up our only means of defence.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.720
- That is true.
- Oh, come on! Gimme something.

27:41.880 --> 27:46.600
Anything! I won't hold you to it. A head
nod if there's another way around this.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.200
It is your planet at stake.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.280
I believe you have it within you
to make the right decision.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.080
All right. Send me back.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.760
Wait! Right there!

28:05.120 --> 28:08.480
Is that a head nod?
A nod is usually down, then back up.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.320
You kinda just went down.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.400
Wait!

28:16.760 --> 28:18.400
Yes, sir.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.480
I understand.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.960
We accept the terms.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.960
Daniel, you wanna tell them we're ready?

28:38.120 --> 28:40.520
Security to level 25.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.080
Medical team to level 25. Emergency.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.640
Sir!

28:45.800 --> 28:48.200
- In here, sir!
- (Nirrti) What are these sounds?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.600
Please just stay in your rooms!

29:02.160 --> 29:04.840
He's stable, but he took
quite a blow to the head.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.320
- There's intracranial swelling.
- Junior taking care of it?

29:08.480 --> 29:11.280
Yes. His larval Goa'uld
is assisting in the healing.

29:11.440 --> 29:15.240
There shouldn't be any brain damage,
but we won't know until he wakes up.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.320
- How long?
- That's up to him.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.760
- What about Cronus?
- Oh, he should only be so lucky.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.160
Severe internal injuries,
and his host is dying.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.520
Shouldn't his snake take care of him?

29:27.680 --> 29:32.480
In Goa'uld physiology, the symbiote
can't heal injuries this severe on its own.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.200
We're doing all we can,
but I don't think he's gonna make it.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.520
It could be hours, could be minutes.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.760
I have the security video tape.
You'll want to see this.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.080
The guards in the hall sounded the alarm.
Teal'c passed them...

29:58.240 --> 30:00.840
..and told them
he was going to see Cronus.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.760
Well, Nirrti and Yu
are demanding an explanation.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.840
Do we tell 'em?

30:06.000 --> 30:10.800
From the video tape, it looks like Teal'c
is involved. Not that he's responsible.

30:10.960 --> 30:15.480
I don't believe Teal'c would sacrifice
our interests for a personal vendetta.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.280
What personal vendetta?

30:20.880 --> 30:23.920
Teal'c and Cronus
have some pretty heavy history.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.000
Such as?

30:26.880 --> 30:30.480
- Cronus killed Teal'c's father.
- Oh, for cryin' out loud!

30:30.640 --> 30:34.360
Why doesn't he tell us these things?
Why didn't you tell us?

30:35.840 --> 30:38.320
He confided in me.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.200
- I don't think Teal'c would do this.
- No, but the case against him...

30:42.360 --> 30:44.600
..just got a little more interesting.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.080
- We have to tell the Goa'ulds something.
- If we lie, we could make things worse.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.160
Doctor?

30:50.320 --> 30:54.080
So maybe the Goa'ulds
can do something for Cronus that I can't.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.920
(Hammond)
Let's tell the Goa'uld what we know.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.160
- Major, find out what really happened.
- Yes, sir.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.520
You will pay for this.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.560
We know it looks bad.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.200
But we're not sure
what actually transpired.

31:21.360 --> 31:25.200
Whoever is responsible for this atrocity
must be brought before us.

31:25.360 --> 31:31.080
- We're trying to find out what happened.
- Your people will suffer greatly for this!

31:31.240 --> 31:34.000
Just hang on
before you go dooming everybody!

31:34.160 --> 31:37.360
We want to know
if there's anything you can do for him.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.080
- He's dying.
- We can do nothing here...

31:40.240 --> 31:42.640
..in your primitive facilities.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.720
OK. Can you use one of these?

32:16.120 --> 32:20.880
His injuries are too severe. The only way
to save him is with a sarcophagus.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.440
OK. We don't have one of those.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.960
Then we'll prepare to leave immediately.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.600
(Thor) Let them take Cronus.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.120
They'll attack us.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.320
If you hold them, the rest of
the System Lords will attack regardless.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.080
Look,...

32:42.240 --> 32:44.240
..Teal'c didn't do this.

32:44.400 --> 32:49.280
I have been instructed by the Asgard
High Council to leave Earth's orbit.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.800
And that's in line with your policy
of limited benevolence?

32:52.960 --> 32:55.520
I have explained our position.

32:55.680 --> 33:00.440
To borrow from a human euphemism,
it is not a perfect galaxy.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.920
I get a little testy when faced with
the annihilation of our corner of it.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.520
We sympathise with you.

33:07.680 --> 33:11.960
Right. And yet you'll still just sit by
and watch 'em destroy us.

33:12.120 --> 33:17.320
We cannot interfere without beginning a
larger war that cannot be won at this time.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.640
(Yu) I command you to release us!

33:22.800 --> 33:27.080
We must leave now and take Cronus
before his death is on your heads.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.760
I'm sorry. I can't let you go.

33:29.920 --> 33:35.280
If we do not report back, Earth will suffer
the full force of the System Lords' wrath.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.600
That's going to happen
whether we let you go or not.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.600
You have violated every code mandated!

33:41.760 --> 33:44.120
The Asgard will not protect you!

33:44.280 --> 33:49.280
Actually, you're wrong about something.
There's one rule we haven't broken yet.

33:58.280 --> 34:02.120
Any idea of what sort of time frame
surrounds this impending attack?

34:07.080 --> 34:09.760
The President is readying
his statement to the UN.

34:09.920 --> 34:14.280
From what you're saying, Earth should
begin preparing for this onslaught now.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.719
Boy, did this get outta hand.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.159
(phone)

34:18.320 --> 34:19.840
Hammond.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.639
Thank you. Teal'c is conscious.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.239
Cronus requested my presence.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
So you went... alone?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.719
It is what he requested.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.440
When I arrived,
he denied making the request.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.159
- Before I could leave, we were attacked.
- By whom?

34:36.320 --> 34:38.000
An invisible force.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.080
Invisible force?

34:43.400 --> 34:45.600
A Reetou?

34:45.760 --> 34:48.800
Could one have come through the gate
with the Goa'ulds?

34:48.960 --> 34:52.080
We could break out the eradication rods
and sweep the base.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.639
I did not sense the presence of a Reetou.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.040
I almost wish you had.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.560
Are you aware of any of the Goa'uld
having stealth technology?

35:00.720 --> 35:02.920
I am not.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.960
Hathor had the ability
to appear and disappear.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.360
OK, she's dead.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.680
- Right? Please, tell me she's dead.
- Yeah.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.480
I did not attack Cronus.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.920
We believe you, but nobody else will.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.960
Certainly not those lying, scheming,
no-good-for-nothing, slimy,...

35:24.120 --> 35:25.960
..overdressed stylemongers.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.000
I'd like to try something.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.680
I wasn't finished yet.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.000
(Dr Fraiser) Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

35:43.160 --> 35:46.760
I've made it work before,
just not on a living... thing.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.800
Uh, I hate to go all Freudian on you here.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.200
The part of you that knows
how to run those things...

36:13.280 --> 36:18.000
You think I don't want to cure Cronus
because he ordered Jolinar's death.

36:18.160 --> 36:21.480
I just have the memories of Jolinar.
She doesn't control me.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.400
I'm well aware of the stakes here.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.400
I'm just sayin'.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.320
It worked.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.440
You have healed me, human.

37:09.960 --> 37:14.680
I am sure you spared my life
only to prevent your own destruction.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.400
Hey!

37:16.560 --> 37:18.920
We didn't do this to you.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.440
We saved your snaky butt
because we want the treaty to happen.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.040
That is not possible now.

37:26.920 --> 37:30.680
Nirrti and Yu have undoubtedly
blamed the Tauri for this attack on me?

37:30.840 --> 37:33.200
Good catch.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.040
Look,...

37:35.200 --> 37:38.840
..it's obvious to everybody
that one of them did this to you.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.320
What if I can prove which one?
What's that worth to you?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.720
What do you ask in return?

37:51.000 --> 37:55.120
We can't prove anything, sir.
All we know for sure is that Nirrti lied.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.440
But Cronus doesn't know that. And
Nirrti doesn't know what else we know.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.040
- Which is nothing.
- But she doesn't know we know nothing.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.040
- What are you suggesting?
- Maybe it's time...

38:06.200 --> 38:09.840
..we take a page out of the Asgard book
on dealing with these Goa'ulds.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.840
- You're gonna bluff?
- Sounds risky, Colonel.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.920
Yes, sir.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.760
You lied about healing Cronus
with that hand device.

38:24.640 --> 38:30.360
I tried honestly and failed. I was willing to
save him by taking him to a sarcophagus.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.600
Maybe you were, maybe you weren't.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.280
But the fact is,
you are the only Goa'uld here...

38:36.440 --> 38:39.000
..who has the technology to be invisible.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.520
That is a lie!

38:43.680 --> 38:46.520
Who's lying? We called the Tok'ra.

38:46.680 --> 38:50.000
They say you've been phase shifting
in order to battle the Reetou.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.320
You did not share this technology?

38:54.480 --> 38:57.040
- They are lying.
- You dare attack Cronus...

38:57.160 --> 38:59.440
..and defile our meeting with the Asgard!

38:59.600 --> 39:02.800
- It's not true!
- You are the one who opposed this treaty!

39:03.560 --> 39:06.200
You have long coveted Cronus' territory.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.760
Gonach!

39:14.800 --> 39:16.720
(O'Neill) Look out!

39:27.160 --> 39:29.080
Drop the weapon.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.920
Ever seen one of these things work?
Cos right now I'd love to demonstrate.

40:00.760 --> 40:05.760
Cronus said he'd support the treaty and
we wouldn't have to give up our Stargate.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.960
I was kinda hoping
we could count on your vote.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.760
We will not attack your world.

40:30.600 --> 40:34.040
But, if you continue
to use your Stargate,...

40:34.200 --> 40:36.120
..be warned.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.760
Anyone who is caught
by one of the System Lords...

40:39.920 --> 40:41.840
..will be shown no mercy.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.960
They will suffer greatly.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.680
Well, that certainly
makes life more interesting.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.880
Boy, is she gonna get it.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.960
My heart bleeds.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.040
