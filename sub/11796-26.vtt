00:02.535 --> 00:03.937
( bell rings )

00:03.969 --> 00:06.639
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:09.442
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.476 --> 00:12.379
<i>* By the time</i>
<i>I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:16.082
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:19.586
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.654 --> 00:24.657
<i>* If the teacher</i>

<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:27.694

00:30.697 --> 00:34.267

01:07.467 --> 01:10.437
( doorbell rings )

01:15.342 --> 01:17.410
( rings )

01:18.345 --> 01:19.646
Come in,

01:19.679 --> 01:21.514
come in,

01:21.548 --> 01:23.817
- come in.
- Check it out!

01:23.850 --> 01:25.752
( all laughing )

01:25.785 --> 01:28.521
( lisping ) Good evening,
young sirs and madams.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.559
Welcome to a weekend
of mystery and murder.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.427
Aw, you don't scare me.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.529
- ( roars )
- ( whimpers )

01:37.964 --> 01:40.367
Wow, I've never been
in a mansion before.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.169
Yeah!
Look at this suit of armor.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.505
Welcome to
Knockwood Manor.

01:45.538 --> 01:49.242
I am your host,
Steven Jameson III.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.312
And I am your guest,
Zack Morris, the only.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.383
Which one of your is
our radio contest winner?

01:56.416 --> 01:58.551
- Here she is, lucky Lisa.
- Lucky nothing.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.354
I dialed so many times,
I broke a nail.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.623
Well, congratulations, Lisa.

02:03.656 --> 02:07.193
I hope you will all enjoy
our murder mystery weekend.

02:07.227 --> 02:10.562
- I'm sure we will.
- So, let's get on with it.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.632
So where's the corpse,
where's the body?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.671
- She just walked in.
- Hell-ooo!

02:17.704 --> 02:20.940
She looks pretty cute
for a dead chick.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.543
I'm sure you will all enjoy
playing detective

02:23.576 --> 02:27.213
as our murder mystery unfolds.

02:27.247 --> 02:30.483
Ladies and gentlemen,
now that we've all met,

02:30.517 --> 02:32.952
beware that as the hours pass,

02:32.986 --> 02:36.289
someone here is going to die.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.725
And it could be you!

02:38.758 --> 02:42.962
( shrieks ) Save me, Slater!
I'm too cute to die.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.331
Can we choose the victim?

02:45.365 --> 02:49.703
The first person to solve
the mystery will
win the $500 prize.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.438
( crowd murmurs )

02:51.471 --> 02:53.707
But remember,
if you are to survive,

02:53.740 --> 02:58.478
you must suspect everyone
and trust no one.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.914
( thunders )

03:00.947 --> 03:03.550
How'd he do that?

03:03.583 --> 03:06.453
Enough funeral music.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.688
Play something
we can dance to.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.691
I'll play what I want, Pops.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.828
Be careful
who you call Pops, Sonny.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.465
Yeah, I'm the only one
who can call him Pops,
you wimp.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.303
Thank you, my love.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.905
Will I be seeing you
later tonight?

03:25.939 --> 03:29.876
Perhaps <i>oui.</i>
Perhaps <i>non.</i>

03:29.909 --> 03:33.680
I hope <i>non</i> for him
and <i>oui</i> for me.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.083
Your ginger ale, cola,

03:37.083 --> 03:39.586
and mango tonic
with a kiwi twist.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.821
Thank you.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.557
- Lisa,
you're going to drink that?
- No way, girl.

03:44.591 --> 03:48.395
I'm just going to
carry it around.
It matches my outfit.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.699
Your drink, sir.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.772
Ladies, why aren't you
mingling?

03:58.805 --> 04:00.940
Let me introduce you
to our pianist.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.711
Jeanette, are we on a break?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.046
Oh, poof!

04:08.581 --> 04:12.619
Sit, Miss Spano. I'm sure
Victor will play
anything you desire.

04:12.652 --> 04:16.423
For you my beauty, I'd play
the <i>Minute</i>
<i>Waltz</i> in 30 seconds.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.524
( playing quickly )

04:21.060 --> 04:23.530
Oh!

04:23.563 --> 04:26.900
Oh, I would like to apologize.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.837
And I would like to rip off
your little French nose.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.409
<i>Pardonnez-moi?!</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:38.912
Victor, take my drink.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.515
Jeanette, get me
another drink, quickly!

04:42.549 --> 04:43.583
( huffs )

04:46.152 --> 04:47.420
( playing classical music )

04:49.856 --> 04:52.359
You know,
smoking is really bad
for your health.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.462
And our health, too.
Secondary smoke is deadly.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.563
( gasping )

05:00.900 --> 05:03.470
I hate to say I told you so.

05:03.503 --> 05:07.040
All right!
Somebody is finally dead.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.042
You're so insensitive, Zack.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.511
How'd he die?
How'd he die?

05:11.544 --> 05:14.614
Well, he grabbed his throat
before he croaked so...

05:14.647 --> 05:18.351
Oh, he strangled
himself to death.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.560
Hello, boys. I've come
to turn down the beds.

05:27.594 --> 05:32.098
I turned down the bed, too.
The floor is much
better for your back.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.435
I'd like to make you
more comfortable.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.071
May I fluff your pillow?

05:38.104 --> 05:41.074
Oh, fluff away!

05:43.910 --> 05:46.446
- The maid's
really hot for Zack.
- Come on, Screech.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.449
It's only a game.
She's just acting.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.552
Good thing, too.
She's a lousy maid.

05:54.120 --> 05:59.092
Ooh-la-la, Zachary,
you are so adorable.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.094
Dinner will be served shortly.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.563
But I see you're already
having dessert.

06:03.596 --> 06:07.033
Oh, poof.
<i>Au revoir, mon petit.</i>

06:07.033 --> 06:09.903
Why must you torture me so?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.040
You'd better be careful,
Preppie.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.042
The last guy she liked
wound up dead.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.044
I know, but what a
way to go.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.680
Yeah.

06:26.186 --> 06:30.623
There's nothing
like a good murder
to bring out my appetite.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.759
Yo, Bart-man,
when do we eat?

06:32.792 --> 06:35.628
Dinner shall be served
promptly at 7:00.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.764
Relax, fellas.
It's almost 7:00.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.799
That's a nice watch, Lisa.
Is it new?

06:39.833 --> 06:43.837
My daddy gave it to me, but
he won't find out until he
gets his Visa bill.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.077
No one touch a thing.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.948
- Screech, what are you doing?
- Elementary,
my dear Zacky boy.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.083
Sherlock Screech,
at your disposal.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.587
I was thrown at first,
but now I know who did it.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.756
The stable boy.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.924
There is no stable,
you dork.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.695
Ah, then the dog lied.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.701
Please, be seated.
Dinner is about to be served.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.473
The police should arrive
by the time we finished.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.176
You know, I think the maid
murdered the piano player.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.445
She brought him
that poisoned drink.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.514
- But she spilled
that drink on you.
- That's right.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.849
Then Mr. Jameson gave
the piano player his drink.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.218
So the poison was meant
for Mr. Jameson.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.821
Then whoever poured Jameson's
drink must be the killer.

07:34.854 --> 07:38.124
- Yeah,
but who poured the drink?
- Water, sir?

07:39.859 --> 07:42.729
No, thanks.
Trying to quit.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.598
Bartholomew,
you may serve dinner now.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.534
( phone ringing )

07:47.567 --> 07:50.503
Excuse me,
I'll just be a moment.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.108
Don't drink that!

07:55.141 --> 07:57.243
It might be poisoned.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.913
You're right.
You drink it.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.884
Tastes fine to me.
I'll live.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.820
All: Darn!

08:09.289 --> 08:10.757
( glass clinks )

08:10.790 --> 08:14.828
Mr. Jameson,
I know who the killer is.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.731
Really? Do tell.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.233
You see, the murderer
was jealous

08:20.266 --> 08:22.836
because the piano player
had a thing for the maid,

08:22.869 --> 08:25.572
the one woman
he couldn't have.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.140
- Then you mean it's...
- Yes.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.677
The person who
poisoned the drink
is the person who served it.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.645
The butler did it.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.916
Dinner is served.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.289
Care to take
another ''stab'' at it?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.870
I could have sworn
Bart was the killer.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.606
Don't feel bad, Zack.
So you're not a detective.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.542
You're still so very blond,
<i>mon cher.</i>

09:03.743 --> 09:05.545
Monsieur Jameson,

09:05.578 --> 09:10.083
I have brought
Inspector
Picadilly from the Yard.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.153
Thank you so very much,
Jeanette. Now would you
please make some tea?

09:13.787 --> 09:14.888
( huffs )

09:16.890 --> 09:19.826
- Good evening, Inspector...
- Quiet, Jameson.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.595
There's work to be done.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.932
Mm-hmm.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.201
Mm-hmm!

09:32.172 --> 09:33.807
Mm-hmm...

09:43.583 --> 09:47.620
Where were you
when the butler was stabbed?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.924
I'm... I'm... I'm innocent,
I tell ya!

09:50.957 --> 09:52.926
I didn't do it.
I'm innocent!

09:52.959 --> 09:55.295
All right, I confess.
I did it!

09:55.328 --> 09:56.930
You didn't do anything,
you twink.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.798
Sir, we were all in the
dining room.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.067
All of us except for the maid.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.136
( clears throat, chuckles )

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
No...

10:09.976 --> 10:15.215
Tell me,
who was the last person
with the piano player?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.317
Oh... Well, I was.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.919
Until the maid
spilled her drink on me.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.055
All: The maid!!!

10:22.088 --> 10:23.790
Too obvious.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.659
No, it wasn't the maid.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.029
The real murderer is...

10:31.264 --> 10:33.800
Picadilly: Aargh!

10:41.341 --> 10:44.110
I don't believe this.
Now we'll
never know who the killer is.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.345
But he just told us.

10:45.378 --> 10:50.784
All we have to do is find out
whose real name is ''Aaargh.''

10:50.817 --> 10:54.421
My necklace!
Someone has stolen
my diamond necklace.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.223
What?! That's not
part of the script.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.893
- You mean this
isn't part of the game?
- No!

10:59.926 --> 11:03.129
Someone must have stolen
Mrs. Bankhead's necklace.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.331
( metal crashes,
woman screams )

11:09.769 --> 11:12.739
Zack: Jeanette,
are you okay?

11:12.772 --> 11:15.241
Yes, but I dropped the tea

11:15.275 --> 11:18.111
because this floor
is so slippery.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.946
( all sigh )

11:19.979 --> 11:23.983
So our jewel thief
is also a floor waxer.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.087
- I don't like
what's going on...
- Look out!!!

11:28.488 --> 11:31.358
Are you all right,
Mr. Jameson? You were
almost the next victim.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.361
- Come on, it was planned.
- No, that was not
part of the game.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.463
Lisa, thank you
for saving my life.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.932
( murmuring )

11:38.965 --> 11:41.301
- Oh, it was no big deal.
- No big deal?

11:41.334 --> 11:44.371
Another inch and you
would've had a free nose job.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.240
You mean
I could've been killed?

11:47.273 --> 11:48.241
Oh, hey.

11:48.274 --> 11:52.112
- This is getting out of hand.
- You're right.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.115
I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to end the game.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.317
- ( all protesting )
- What about my necklace?

11:57.350 --> 12:00.220
I think that's best left
to the real police.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.155
- So what do we do now?
- Are you kidding?

12:02.188 --> 12:06.226
We get out of here, beat it,
scram, skedaddle, vamoose...

12:06.259 --> 12:07.927
Thanks.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.429
He needed that!

12:09.462 --> 12:13.466
I'm still a little shaky.
Can you help me upstairs?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.469
Lisa, why don't you and Zack
stop by my office
before you leave

12:16.503 --> 12:18.938
and I'll see that
you get vouchers
for another weekend.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.206
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.309
Mr. Jameson, since
I did make the best guess,

12:23.343 --> 12:25.812
don't you think I should get
part of that prize money?

12:25.845 --> 12:30.216
I think getting out of here
alive is more important
than the prize money.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.185
Hmm. Good point.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.390
- Well, I'm all packed.
- Aren't you
guys finished yet?

12:37.424 --> 12:40.293
- I'll be done in a second.
- Will you hurry up?

12:40.326 --> 12:42.262
There is a real killer
on the loose.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.964
Let's get out of here!

12:44.998 --> 12:48.802
- ( screams ) Zack!
- What's wrong?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.837
I thought I saw somebody
at the window.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.273
Lisa,
we're on the second floor.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.811
A-ha! So, our floor-waxing
jewel thief must be very tall.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.448
Screech, you're an idiot.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.520
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little jumpy.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.955
I'll help Zack
with his stuff.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.423
Why don't you guys go
load the car?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.059
I'll wait for you, my darling.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.295
We can share a seatbelt.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.068
( laughs ) Zack,
I am so embarrassed.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.270
Oh, that's all right.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.806
We're all a little scared.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.410
Wait, we forgot the vouchers.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.413
Why don't you go
down and get them
and I'll just finish packing?

13:33.446 --> 13:37.884
- Are you sure
you'll be okay alone?
- Yeah, I'll be fine. Thanks.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.288
- ( Zack chuckles )
- Go ahead.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.159
Lock the door
on your way out, please.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.928
Sure, I'll double-lock it.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.398
Keep Screech out too.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.868
( lock clicks )

14:06.446 --> 14:10.116
- ( knock on door )
- Come in.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.951
Mr. Jameson,
I came by for the...

14:12.052 --> 14:14.454
Hey, what happened?
It looks like my gym locker.

14:14.487 --> 14:18.558
It was like this when i got
here. Someone was after
the prize money.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.327
Wow. Well, I hope
you're getting
out of here too.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.298
I am, as soon as I give you
your vouchers.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.344
Thanks. I hope
everything turns out okay.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.545
Good luck.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.147
( Jameson screams )

14:43.383 --> 14:45.085
Mr. Jameson?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.353
( chuckles )

14:47.253 --> 14:49.222
That was a good one!

14:49.255 --> 14:52.459
Mr. Jameson, come out,
come out, wherever you are.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.928
Mr. Jameson.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.264
Mr. Jameson?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.368
Oh boy.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.373
What happened?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.642
Mr. Jameson was
here a minute ago,
and then he sort of vanished.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.345
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you were packing.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.615
Lisa's packing. I came to get
these vouchers
for a free weekend.

15:15.648 --> 15:19.219
Free?
I do not think so.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.957
Monsieur Jameson is so cheap,
he steals towels
from his own hotel.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.059
No, really, look.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.496
These aren't vouchers.
This is money.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.098
- Money?
- How did that get in there?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.067
You stole the prize money.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.337
You're a thief and a murderer!

15:37.370 --> 15:39.372
I'm calling the real police.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.409
- Jeanette...
- Screech:
Zack, why did you do it?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.445
- lf you needed money,
I'd have...
- Shut up, Screech!

15:45.478 --> 15:48.081
This is ridiculous.
I didn't kill anybody.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.650
( scoffs )
Tell it to the judge.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.218
( thunders )

15:58.958 --> 16:02.629
- I didn't kill Mr. Jameson!
- Why'd you take the money?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.431
- I didn't.
- Where'd you dump the body?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.766
- I didn't.
- Did you think
you'd get away with it?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.836
No, I didn't!
I mean, I didn't do anything.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.805
Take it easy, Darren.
He's just a kid.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.841
This whole thing is a set-up.
I just came here to
play a stupid game.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.844
As soon as Mr.
Jameson disappeared,
it stopped being a game.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.448
Yes, and I want
my necklace back!

16:21.481 --> 16:23.950
I am not a crook.
Just ask my friends.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.518
All right, we will.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.288
Just what kind of a person
is Zack Morris?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.724
He's the most honest
person I know.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.860
Well,
unless you count the time
he sold fake IDs at school.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.396
But his mom grounded him
for that!

16:36.429 --> 16:39.699
Zack's never really done
anything wrong.

16:39.733 --> 16:44.070
Except the time he kind of,
sort of stole our
principal's car.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.873
But he gave it back!

16:46.906 --> 16:51.511
I know Zack pretty well
and the last think
he would do is steal.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.547
Although there was that one
time where he
kidnapped Valley's mascot.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.816
But they deserved it.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.687
Zack's my best friend. I've
written down everything
we've done together.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.023
Let's see,
''September 12th, 1986...''

17:04.023 --> 17:06.659
That was the day he tied me
to the roller-coaster tracks.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.329
- Remember that one, Zack?
- Oh yeah,
you're a real sweetheart.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.432
Forgery, auto theft,
kidnapping...

17:12.464 --> 17:14.034
Don't forget attempted murder.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.037
As soon as I get out of jail,
I'm going to murder you.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.039
Wait until Lisa gets here.
She'll tell you...

17:19.039 --> 17:22.608
Lisa! Jameson told her
about the vouchers too.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.044
She'll tell you what
really happened.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.681
Well, then let's go find Lisa.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.852
Lisa, tell these guys
about the vouchers.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.622
- Lisa?
- She's not here, Preppie.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.657
I can see that, Slater!

17:37.691 --> 17:40.660
Look, I locked the door
from the outside.

17:40.694 --> 17:44.431
No,
no, no, see, what I mean is,
she couldn't have gotten out.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.634
Oh, so poof!
She just vanished, hmm?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.904
''Oh, so poof!''
I don't know.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.575
- Poor Lisa.
- Oh, Zack.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.611
I'm telling you,
I left her here
packing my suitcase.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.114
Looks like
she didn't get very far.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.016
Hello? What's this?

18:03.016 --> 18:05.785
My necklace!
Thank goodness.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.020
Ouch!

18:08.021 --> 18:09.756
How did that get in there?

18:09.789 --> 18:11.925
Zack, I'm afraid we're going
to have to search you.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.060
Oh sure, go ahead.
Search me.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.030
Do you think you'll find
Lisa hiding in
my shirt pocket?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.565
Nice watch.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.501
A little dainty for you,
though, ain't it?

18:21.534 --> 18:24.604
- That's Lisa's watch.
- Zack! You fiend!

18:24.637 --> 18:27.107
You've murdered
my future wife!

18:28.775 --> 18:32.746
- Lisa would never marry you.
- Oh sure, now!

18:32.779 --> 18:35.081
You guys are nuts.
I'm telling you
I've been framed.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.718
We'll see. For now,
everybody stay in your rooms.

18:38.752 --> 18:41.121
Stay in my room?
With that
cold-blooded butcher?!

18:41.154 --> 18:43.156
Relax, Screech.
I'll protect you.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.525
Aw, Slater,
I knew you cared.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.063
Zack, if you go to jail,
I'll visit you every Sunday.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.965
Gee, thanks a bunch!

18:56.836 --> 18:59.706
So how'd you do it, Zack?
Did you poison her lipstick?

19:01.007 --> 19:04.477
Whoa. Down, boy!
Chill out, guys.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.780
Something really weird
is going on here.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.482
We've got to figure out
how Lisa got out of this room.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.119
- We?
- I'm serious.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.588
How could she get out
without the key?

19:15.622 --> 19:18.725
Both the door and the windows
were locked.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.894
Maybe there's
a secret passage.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.563
( scoffs )Give me a break.
A secret passage?

19:23.596 --> 19:26.766
Like if I turn
this candle here,
the wall is going to open up!

19:30.203 --> 19:34.107
- There is a secret passage!
- I knew it all along.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.775
- Screech, you go first.
- Yeah, go ahead.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.043
- No, it's dark in there.
- You go first. Come on.

19:37.077 --> 19:38.611
- No, no!
- Go on!

19:47.053 --> 19:49.222
Slater: Come on,
my suit is getting all... Ugh!

19:49.255 --> 19:50.890
Where are we?

19:52.559 --> 19:55.595
Hey, it's Jameson's office.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.664
It's too bright.
They might see us.
Kill the lights.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.133
Haven't you done
enough killing already?

20:06.740 --> 20:09.809
It looks like somebody
had a party in here.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.845
Yeah, would you
look at that?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.147
Zack: Drinks and a cigarette.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.582
But who?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.518
I don't know,
but one of them left naked.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.522
No. But someone did
change their clothes.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.858
And I know who.
( chuckles )

20:24.891 --> 20:26.726
Guys, why don't you get
everyone together?

20:26.760 --> 20:29.662
- I'm going to
solve this mystery.
- ( thunders )

20:32.699 --> 20:34.567
What's this all about, Morris?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.236
We haven't got time
for any more of your games.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.773
- Maybe just one more.
- Let's play Monopoly.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.042
I get the thimble.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.245
Just give me a chance,
and I'll prove I'm innocent.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.247
Let's hear him out.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.583
You see, it all ties together.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.019
After the butler and the piano
player were murdered,

20:53.053 --> 20:54.888
the killer knew we were close,

20:54.921 --> 20:57.624
so he stole the necklace
and rigged the battleaxe.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.727
Hey, leave Mrs. Bankhead
out of this.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.266
But the killer
couldn't have planted
the watch and necklace on me

21:06.299 --> 21:08.201
without an accomplice.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.071
Right... Lisa?

21:11.071 --> 21:14.908
( giggles )
Hi, guys.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.244
Lisa, even dead,
you're beautiful.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.780
- Lisa was in on it?
- Nice going, Zack.

21:20.814 --> 21:24.284
- How'd you figure it out?
- I knew how you
got out of the bedroom

21:24.317 --> 21:25.285
when we found
the secret passage.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.120
But I didn't know why

21:27.153 --> 21:31.191
until we went to Mr. Jameson's
office and found this.

21:31.224 --> 21:35.795
You see, only Lisa Turtle
drinks a mango tonic
with a kiwi twist.

21:35.829 --> 21:38.231
That's right,
but she wasn't drinking alone.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.768
That's right.
She was drinking
with the killer.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.103
But, there's lipstick on
that glass.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.105
So the killer must be a woman.

21:45.105 --> 21:48.108
Then Jameson was
there with Lisa
and the other woman.

21:48.108 --> 21:50.977
That's what the killer
wanted us to think.

21:51.011 --> 21:53.947
I found one of Mr. Jameson's
cigarettes with
lipstick on it.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.250
So, either Jameson gave
the other woman a cigarette,

21:57.283 --> 22:01.821
- or Jameson is
the other woman.
- ( gasps )

22:01.855 --> 22:04.057
I give you our murderer.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.862
Brilliant, Zack!

22:08.895 --> 22:11.664
You figured out that
the game never stopped.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.700
Yep, and I'll take
that prize money now.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.269
Not so fast,
my impetuous friend.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.105
You've done well,
but I'll take it from here.

22:19.139 --> 22:21.741
There's nothing left
to figure out, dork.

22:22.876 --> 22:23.943
Oh.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.080
Yes, there is.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.282
Mr. Jameson couldn't
have killed the inspector

22:29.315 --> 22:31.718
and stolen the necklace
at the same time.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.887
He must have had
a second accomplice.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.189
You know, the geek was right.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.958
The butler did do it!

22:40.093 --> 22:42.162
You rang, sir?

22:45.098 --> 22:48.335
And let's see who
you really are, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

22:48.368 --> 22:49.903
Ow!

22:50.337 --> 22:51.371
Oops!

22:52.339 --> 22:54.374
Come back here!

23:00.046 --> 23:02.749
( instrumental
theme music plays )
