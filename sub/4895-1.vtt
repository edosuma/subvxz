( Girl ) People once believed
that when someone dies...

00:46.896 --> 00:51.016
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

00:51.096 --> 00:54.295
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

00:54.375 --> 00:59.415
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.

00:59.495 --> 01:02.414
Then sometimes,
just sometimes...

01:02.494 --> 01:07.294
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

Wedding was tomorrow night.

Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.765
Nobody.

02:10.285 --> 02:14.085
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

( Cawing )

02:31.242 --> 02:34.442
( Man ) You guys can't come in here
and take her away like this.

02:34.522 --> 02:39.121
There are procedures. You should have
cleared this with me first.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.401
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

02:41.441 --> 02:44.201
- We found her, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.

02:44.281 --> 02:46.760
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.160
I can see why they took away
your gold shield.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.119

to me about Shelly.

about everything...

04:28.907 --> 04:33.146

But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...

nothing can keep them apart.

39:03.429 --> 39:07.828
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Does it-- Fuck, does it hurt?

39:07.908 --> 39:09.868
Oh, God.

39:09.948 --> 39:13.867
Look what you've done
to my sheets.

39:15.707 --> 39:17.267
( Gun Uncocking )

39:23.426 --> 39:25.106
( Crying )

39:25.186 --> 39:28.585
( Sobbing )

39:37.104 --> 39:39.024
I've got a gun
in my pocket.

39:41.944 --> 39:44.543
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?

40:01.581 --> 40:05.301
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

40:06.700 --> 40:08.860
( Screaming )

40:12.820 --> 40:16.499
Look.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.858
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

40:20.938 --> 40:25.498
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

40:35.497 --> 40:40.096
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

41:08.652 --> 41:12.172
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

41:12.252 --> 41:14.411
Now fill it up!

41:15.451 --> 41:18.691
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

41:18.771 --> 41:21.330
I really need this.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.529
All right.

41:29.569 --> 41:33.369
You burn yourself
playing with matches?

41:33.409 --> 41:35.888
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

41:35.968 --> 41:38.328
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

41:38.408 --> 41:41.208
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

41:41.288 --> 41:43.967
Get my friend here
a glass of blood.

41:44.047 --> 41:47.327
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!

41:47.407 --> 41:50.207
Hey, good night, Darla.

41:52.526 --> 41:56.086
- You stay put right there.
- ( Groaning )

42:03.805 --> 42:07.124
Get away, steamhead.

42:23.042 --> 42:25.522
( Groaning )

42:25.602 --> 42:27.482
Shh.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.520
( Man On Radio ) As you can see, I'm
on the corner of 27th and Washington...

42:42.560 --> 42:45.199
- ( Door Squeaking )
- the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

42:45.279 --> 42:48.119
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...

42:48.199 --> 42:51.038
across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.

42:51.078 --> 42:53.158
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...

42:53.238 --> 42:55.278
but lost the lives
of two fire fighters.

42:55.358 --> 42:59.917
In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police--

42:59.997 --> 43:02.797
Freeze!

43:02.877 --> 43:06.236
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

43:06.276 --> 43:08.196
( Whispering ) Fuck.

43:10.076 --> 43:12.156
Good likeness.

43:12.236 --> 43:15.795
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

43:15.875 --> 43:18.035
You still have your hat on.

43:21.794 --> 43:23.794
I gotta sit down.

43:24.554 --> 43:26.434
Shi--

43:26.474 --> 43:29.233
( Albrecht ) Holy Shit.

43:30.633 --> 43:33.153
Say...

43:33.233 --> 43:37.352
are you some kind of... ghost?

43:37.432 --> 43:39.312
Boo!

43:46.591 --> 43:50.950
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.

43:52.870 --> 43:56.790
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

43:56.870 --> 43:59.829
She, ah, was beaten and raped.

43:59.909 --> 44:04.309
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

44:04.389 --> 44:06.908
Come on. Read the file.

44:06.988 --> 44:11.148
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.

44:11.228 --> 44:14.307
Her body finally just gave it up.

44:14.347 --> 44:18.067
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.

44:27.545 --> 44:29.385
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

44:29.465 --> 44:33.305
- ( Sobbing )
- Hey.

44:34.665 --> 44:37.384
You okay?

44:37.424 --> 44:40.024
I saw her.

44:41.584 --> 44:44.743
I saw her
through your eyes.

44:44.823 --> 44:46.823
You stayed with her
the whole time.

44:46.903 --> 44:52.142
Yeah, well, you got to
understand something, all right?

44:52.222 --> 44:56.782
I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.

44:56.822 --> 44:59.661
Give me something
I could work with.

44:59.701 --> 45:01.861
Yeah.

45:01.901 --> 45:04.261
Look, I--

45:04.301 --> 45:06.700
Why didn't you do
something about it?

45:06.780 --> 45:09.980
You think any people in that building,
even the ones who signed the petition...

45:10.060 --> 45:13.379
would talk after
what happened to you?

45:13.459 --> 45:16.539
I kept asking
questions and...

45:16.619 --> 45:19.179
finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

45:23.018 --> 45:24.898
This your wife?

45:24.978 --> 45:29.257
Yeah, we, uh-- Well, not anymore,
we're getting a divorce.

45:31.057 --> 45:33.897
It's funny.

45:33.937 --> 45:37.776
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

45:37.856 --> 45:41.216
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

45:41.296 --> 45:44.175
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.

45:53.414 --> 45:57.693
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

46:02.173 --> 46:05.252
You going to vanish
into thin air again?

46:08.732 --> 46:11.332
I thought I'd use
your front door.

46:14.251 --> 46:19.850
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what
happened to you and your girlfriend.

46:21.330 --> 46:23.570
Yeah.

46:27.929 --> 46:30.409
- ( Door Opening, Closing )
- ( Whispering ) Yeah.

46:30.489 --> 46:33.849
( Gideon ) I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

46:33.929 --> 46:36.928
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

46:37.008 --> 46:39.928
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

46:40.008 --> 46:43.127
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

46:43.167 --> 46:45.607
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.

46:45.687 --> 46:49.926
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

46:50.006 --> 46:54.806
He winked at ya?
Musicians.

46:54.886 --> 46:57.245
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard...

46:57.325 --> 46:59.725
shit about what you're going to do
about all this crap!

46:59.805 --> 47:05.084
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed and went swirling.

47:05.164 --> 47:07.804
You ain't lost everything.

47:07.884 --> 47:12.763
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!

47:12.843 --> 47:16.283
Fair enough. Catch.

47:17.363 --> 47:19.682
Aah! Jesus.

47:19.762 --> 47:22.082
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

47:22.162 --> 47:24.082
What're you telling me,
this thing is real?

47:24.122 --> 47:27.641
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

47:27.721 --> 47:31.521
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

47:31.601 --> 47:35.560
You're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!

47:35.640 --> 47:38.200
Yeah.

47:38.240 --> 47:43.199
Eyes see. It's one of the most important
things I learned from my sister.

47:43.279 --> 47:46.399
Sister? She's supposed to be
your sister? ( Laughing )

47:46.479 --> 47:49.678
My father's daughter.
That's right.

47:49.758 --> 47:52.798
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

47:52.878 --> 47:55.038
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.

47:55.118 --> 47:58.477
With a lot of detail.
What do you say?

47:58.597 --> 48:01.917
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

48:01.997 --> 48:05.236
He told me to tell T-bird
that death was on its way.

48:05.316 --> 48:07.476
Whatever the fuck that means.

48:07.516 --> 48:11.156
Draven. He said his name
was Eric Draven.

48:12.195 --> 48:14.195
Want to relax
that thing now?

48:14.235 --> 48:18.715
This bird man, he just happened
to let you live, huh?

48:18.794 --> 48:22.994
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

48:23.034 --> 48:25.634
I ain't making all this up.

48:25.714 --> 48:30.033
I ain't twisted
like you two fucks.

48:31.753 --> 48:33.792
All right.

48:38.272 --> 48:43.071
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.

48:43.151 --> 48:46.671
Yeah. ( Laughing )

48:52.910 --> 48:55.790
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

49:02.429 --> 49:04.668
Thanks.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.908
Funboy said he saw
a black bird too.

49:06.988 --> 49:09.468
A big one.

49:09.548 --> 49:14.227
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

49:14.307 --> 49:18.067
I'll have the janitor
come on up.

to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.

has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city, "Devil's Night"...

57:15.163 --> 57:18.442
the name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.

57:18.522 --> 57:23.682
Last year over 200 blazes were reported,
and 11 people lost their lives.

57:23.722 --> 57:28.681
Tonight may become the biggest
and deadliest Devil's Night ever.

from all surrounding counties--

57:32.320 --> 57:35.960
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.519
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

57:40.599 --> 57:45.319
- Wait, you loved eggs.
- Yeah, when I was five.

57:45.399 --> 57:49.358
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

57:49.438 --> 57:52.638
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

57:52.678 --> 57:57.597
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

57:57.637 --> 58:03.196
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.

58:03.236 --> 58:08.276
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

58:10.675 --> 58:14.795
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

58:14.875 --> 58:16.994
Over easy.

58:18.994 --> 58:23.514
I like 'em
over easy... Mom.

58:33.672 --> 58:35.832
Hey, Albrecht.

58:35.912 --> 58:38.392
( Sighs )

58:38.472 --> 58:41.271
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

58:41.351 --> 58:44.471
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.

58:44.551 --> 58:48.590
- We're gonna have to l.D. his teeth.
- His name is T-bird.

58:48.670 --> 58:50.510
Arson was his specialty.

58:50.590 --> 58:52.470
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

58:52.550 --> 58:56.309
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.

58:56.389 --> 58:58.549
Come here.

59:02.148 --> 59:04.028
You're holding out on me.

59:04.108 --> 59:07.508
I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

59:07.588 --> 59:10.707
and you're covering up
for somebody.

59:10.787 --> 59:13.107
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

59:13.187 --> 59:16.906
- You're the detective. You tell me.
- Okay.

59:16.986 --> 59:19.026
Gideon's blows all to hell and you're
having a chitchat with some weirdo...

59:19.106 --> 59:21.866
who winds up in T-bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

59:21.906 --> 59:24.745
Then you steal one of
my case files from homicide...

59:24.825 --> 59:26.665
and you're saying this is
just a fucking automobile accident?

59:26.745 --> 59:28.945
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

59:29.025 --> 59:30.944
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

59:31.024 --> 59:32.944
You gotta write that shit down.

59:32.984 --> 59:34.864
All right, smart-ass.

59:34.904 --> 59:37.864
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

59:37.904 --> 59:41.703
- Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.
- Suspension?

59:41.743 --> 59:45.343
- For what?
- Misconduct.

59:45.423 --> 59:49.262
( Dials Phone )
Yeah, give me the lab.

you're going crazy.

- Gabriel.
- ( Meows )

1:01:33.048 --> 1:01:35.728
I thought you were dead.

1:01:35.768 --> 1:01:38.927
You're not dead, are you?

1:02:02.684 --> 1:02:05.484
I knew it was you.

1:02:07.324 --> 1:02:10.123
Even with the makeup.

1:02:14.763 --> 1:02:17.242
I remembered your song.

1:02:17.322 --> 1:02:20.922
You said,
"Can't rain all the time."

1:02:21.002 --> 1:02:24.121
That is from your song, right?

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:36.640
- ( Cawing )
- Come on, Eric. I know you're here.

1:02:38.919 --> 1:02:42.839
I miss you...
and Shelly.

1:02:45.798 --> 1:02:49.118
Get so lonely
all by myself.

1:02:50.878 --> 1:02:55.317
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

1:02:55.397 --> 1:02:58.397
Sarah, I do care.

1:03:09.155 --> 1:03:11.195
That's him.
That's him!

1:03:11.275 --> 1:03:14.475
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

1:03:14.555 --> 1:03:17.674
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

1:03:17.754 --> 1:03:20.194
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

1:03:20.274 --> 1:03:22.953
And he flash fried T-bird
to his fucking car!

1:03:23.033 --> 1:03:26.393
Aw, T-bird!
Here's to you, buddy.

1:03:26.473 --> 1:03:30.232
Maybe we oughta just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.

1:03:31.512 --> 1:03:35.912
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

1:03:35.992 --> 1:03:38.471
- Empty.
- Fire it--

1:03:38.551 --> 1:03:40.391
Grave?
What grave?

1:03:40.471 --> 1:03:42.591
What about
my fucking grave?

1:03:42.671 --> 1:03:43.951
- ( Screams )
- Three out of four.

1:03:44.031 --> 1:03:47.150
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

1:03:47.230 --> 1:03:49.750
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.

1:03:49.830 --> 1:03:52.869
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he says...
( Whistles )

1:03:52.949 --> 1:03:56.109
..."Waste them both." And now
this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

1:03:56.189 --> 1:03:59.908
( Groaning )

1:03:59.988 --> 1:04:02.948
This ghost gonna
kill my ass next.

1:04:03.028 --> 1:04:06.628
- This ghost gonna kill--
- Hey.

1:04:06.708 --> 1:04:08.587
That ain't no ghost.

1:04:10.427 --> 1:04:13.467
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.

1:04:13.507 --> 1:04:15.426
We might need him.

1:04:16.866 --> 1:04:19.226
Ghost gonna kill my--

1:04:31.424 --> 1:04:35.224
He like his plain
or with onions?

1:04:35.264 --> 1:04:38.583
Fine.
Don't talk to me.

1:04:38.623 --> 1:04:42.583
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

1:04:42.623 --> 1:04:45.142
That's what I thought.

1:04:45.182 --> 1:04:47.862
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

1:04:47.902 --> 1:04:50.102
You'll just think
I'm nuts.

1:04:50.142 --> 1:04:53.621
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

1:04:53.701 --> 1:04:58.821
- You see him too?
- I saw somebody.

1:04:58.901 --> 1:05:02.260
Maybe it was
your fairy godfather.

1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:05.140
Eric didn't come back for me.

1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:09.779
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

1:05:09.859 --> 1:05:12.899
You want a friend

joining us this evening...

- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong. Best reason to quit.

1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:38.279
The idea becomes
an institution.

1:07:38.359 --> 1:07:40.919
What was the idea?

1:07:40.999 --> 1:07:44.598
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

1:07:44.678 --> 1:07:47.358
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

1:07:47.438 --> 1:07:50.398
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

1:14:48.622 --> 1:14:54.101
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

1:14:54.181 --> 1:14:57.020
- I like him already.
- The crow...

1:14:57.100 --> 1:15:01.380
is his link between
the land of the living...

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:03.700
and the realm of the dead.

1:15:03.780 --> 1:15:08.139
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

1:15:08.179 --> 1:15:10.099
Hmm.

1:15:32.256 --> 1:15:34.176
I'm coming home, Shelly.

1:15:34.256 --> 1:15:36.335
( Laughing )

1:15:36.415 --> 1:15:41.894
( Laughing Continues )

1:15:41.974 --> 1:15:43.854
( Chuckles )

1:15:47.934 --> 1:15:51.973
( Children Laughing, Hooting )

1:15:52.053 --> 1:15:56.133
( Laughing )

1:16:21.249 --> 1:16:23.609
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery...

1:16:23.649 --> 1:16:25.649
in the middle
of the night, right?

1:16:25.689 --> 1:16:27.408
Safest place in the world to be.

1:16:27.448 --> 1:16:32.048
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

1:16:32.088 --> 1:16:36.087
It's really late, Sarah.

1:16:36.167 --> 1:16:38.807
You didn't say good-bye.

1:16:38.927 --> 1:16:42.726
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

1:16:42.806 --> 1:16:46.886
And you're never coming back.

1:16:52.925 --> 1:16:56.045
I gave this to Shelly once.

1:16:59.604 --> 1:17:02.444
I think she'd like you
to have it.

1:17:06.323 --> 1:17:08.523
This way you'll
always remember her.

1:17:08.563 --> 1:17:11.043
I'll never take it off.

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.120
I better go sneak
back in the house.

1:17:37.999 --> 1:17:39.879
Bye.

1:17:59.036 --> 1:18:01.756
- ( Muffled Screaming )
- Shh! Shh!

1:18:03.596 --> 1:18:05.915
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.

1:18:05.955 --> 1:18:10.555
( Muffled Screaming Continues )

1:18:12.554 --> 1:18:14.914
Come on.
Come on.

1:18:27.672 --> 1:18:31.632
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

1:18:33.152 --> 1:18:36.151
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say, hmm?

1:18:42.310 --> 1:18:45.470
Her eyes are so innocent.

1:18:56.348 --> 1:18:58.228
- ( Sarah ) Eric!
- ( Caws )

1:18:58.268 --> 1:19:02.068
Eric, help! Eric!

1:19:05.507 --> 1:19:08.507

1:19:25.665 --> 1:19:27.784
( Crow Flapping, Caws )

1:19:39.903 --> 1:19:42.982
Quick impression for ya.

1:19:43.062 --> 1:19:46.622
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

1:19:46.702 --> 1:19:49.901
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

1:19:49.981 --> 1:19:52.901
( Inhales )
Well, well.

1:19:52.981 --> 1:19:56.580
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that, huh?

1:20:00.860 --> 1:20:03.180
( Cawing )

1:20:04.219 --> 1:20:06.419
Nah. Fuck it.

1:20:12.178 --> 1:20:14.458
( Chuckles )

1:20:14.538 --> 1:20:16.578
Aw, fuck.

1:20:19.657 --> 1:20:23.457
( Muffled Screaming )

1:20:23.537 --> 1:20:27.896
Well, well, well. It does seem to me
that our little life has undergone...

1:20:27.976 --> 1:20:31.656
a rather significant change in the past
few minutes now. Wouldn't you agree?

1:20:31.736 --> 1:20:35.735
( Groaning )

1:20:35.815 --> 1:20:39.055
Well, for a ghost,
you bleed just fine.

1:20:42.454 --> 1:20:44.614
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

1:20:46.214 --> 1:20:48.333
Bye-bye, birdie.

1:21:31.568 --> 1:21:33.607
Ah, shit.

1:21:33.647 --> 1:21:35.687
Well, just came by
to pay my respects...

1:21:35.727 --> 1:21:37.687
and here you are
getting all shot up again.

1:21:37.767 --> 1:21:40.247
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

1:21:40.326 --> 1:21:42.246
Two more.
( Groans )

1:21:42.286 --> 1:21:44.206
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

1:21:44.286 --> 1:21:46.726
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

1:21:46.766 --> 1:21:49.445
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

1:21:49.485 --> 1:21:53.085
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

1:21:55.604 --> 1:21:59.004
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

1:21:59.084 --> 1:22:01.044
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

1:22:01.124 --> 1:22:04.443
I was.
I'm not anymore.

1:22:04.523 --> 1:22:08.563
( Sighs ) Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

1:22:08.643 --> 1:22:11.442
- Come on.
- ( Groaning )

1:22:14.002 --> 1:22:15.962
You take that.

1:22:44.798 --> 1:22:48.117
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.

1:23:09.355 --> 1:23:11.154
( Crow Caws )

1:23:11.234 --> 1:23:14.354
This is all the power
you ever had.

1:23:14.394 --> 1:23:16.434
Now it is mine.

1:23:16.474 --> 1:23:20.033
Pity there's not more time...

1:23:20.113 --> 1:23:22.633
- ( Gun Cocks )
- ...for us.

1:23:23.993 --> 1:23:29.512
( Woman Screaming )

1:23:31.112 --> 1:23:34.871

1:23:36.151 --> 1:23:39.950
( Screaming Continues )

1:23:40.030 --> 1:23:42.750
( Sarah ) Help, Eric!
I'm scared!

1:23:44.790 --> 1:23:47.230
Let me go!

1:23:55.948 --> 1:23:59.348
Let her go!

1:23:59.388 --> 1:24:02.187
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

1:24:02.187 --> 1:24:03.827
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

1:24:03.867 --> 1:24:05.787
All right.

1:24:05.867 --> 1:24:07.827
- ( Sarah Screams )
- No!

1:24:52.341 --> 1:24:53.741
Eric!

1:25:11.578 --> 1:25:14.778
- Sarah?
- Look out!

1:25:18.217 --> 1:25:21.577
- ( Panting )
- Eric!

1:25:29.256 --> 1:25:31.336
You know,
my daddy used to say...

1:25:31.416 --> 1:25:33.815
"Every man's got a devil...

1:25:33.895 --> 1:25:35.935
and you can't rest
till you find him."

1:25:36.015 --> 1:25:38.455
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend--

1:25:38.535 --> 1:25:41.334
I cleared that building.

1:25:41.414 --> 1:25:44.534
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.

1:25:44.614 --> 1:25:47.333
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

1:25:47.413 --> 1:25:50.133
But if it's any consolation
to you...

1:25:50.213 --> 1:25:53.693
you have put
a smile on my face.

1:25:53.773 --> 1:25:56.292
You got a lot
of spirit, son.

1:25:56.332 --> 1:25:58.852
( Unsheathes Knife )
I am going to miss you.

1:25:58.892 --> 1:26:01.332
I have something
to give you.

1:26:01.412 --> 1:26:03.691
I don't want it anymore.

1:26:08.011 --> 1:26:10.890
Thirty hours of pain!

1:26:13.130 --> 1:26:15.730
- All at once!
- ( Groaning )

1:26:15.810 --> 1:26:18.689
- ( Steady Tone )
- All for you.

1:26:31.967 --> 1:26:35.247
( Gasping )

1:26:43.246 --> 1:26:46.286
Yeah.

1:26:52.845 --> 1:26:55.564
Go help him.

1:26:58.764 --> 1:27:00.964
Are you alive?

1:27:02.883 --> 1:27:06.723
( Groans )
God, I need a cigarette.

1:27:12.442 --> 1:27:14.322
Everybody else dead?

1:27:14.362 --> 1:27:16.561
You helped me.

1:27:16.641 --> 1:27:19.081
What you kept in here
saved me.

1:27:19.161 --> 1:27:22.161
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

1:27:22.241 --> 1:27:25.120
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:32.559
Oh, yuck.
( Spits )

1:27:32.639 --> 1:27:37.439
I'm quitting as of now...
if I live.

1:27:45.558 --> 1:27:48.877
Stay with him
until help comes.

1:27:48.917 --> 1:27:52.237
He'll be okay, right?

1:27:52.317 --> 1:27:54.436
Eric?

1:27:55.836 --> 1:27:59.276
( Sighs )
He does that a lot.

Shelly.

1:28:28.952 --> 1:28:33.591
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicides.

1:28:33.671 --> 1:28:36.271
At least it stopped raining, huh?

1:28:36.311 --> 1:28:39.590
- It can't rain all the time.
- No, I don't believe it.

1:28:39.670 --> 1:28:42.870
- This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home.

1:28:42.910 --> 1:28:44.790
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1:28:44.830 --> 1:28:49.229
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

1:28:49.309 --> 1:28:51.269
You missed it.

1:28:51.349 --> 1:28:53.908
Get him outta here!

1:28:53.988 --> 1:28:56.468

1:29:55.460 --> 1:29:57.340
Thanks.

( Sarah ) If the people we love
are stolen from us...

1:30:05.339 --> 1:30:10.218
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

1:30:10.298 --> 1:30:15.937
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.

1:30:33.015 --> 1:30:36.055
* We walk the narrow path *

1:30:38.454 --> 1:30:41.814
* Beneath the smoking skies *

* Sometimes barely
tell the difference *

1:30:49.173 --> 1:30:52.933
* Between darkness and light *

1:30:56.532 --> 1:30:59.492
* Do we have faith *

1:31:02.051 --> 1:31:05.371
* In what we believe *

1:31:08.130 --> 1:31:10.490
* The truest test *

1:31:10.530 --> 1:31:13.210
* Is when we cannot *

1:31:13.250 --> 1:31:16.249
* When we cannot see *

1:31:18.049 --> 1:31:21.209

* And the women cried and the *

* And the children know that there's *

* There's something wrong *

1:31:32.487 --> 1:31:35.927
* It's hard to believe that love *

1:31:36.007 --> 1:31:39.446
* Will prevail *

1:31:39.526 --> 1:31:44.726
* Oh, it won't rain all the time *

1:31:46.085 --> 1:31:51.765
* The sky won't fall forever *

1:31:51.845 --> 1:31:57.364

* I lie awake at night *

1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:29.320
* And I wish you were here *

1:32:31.279 --> 1:32:34.119
* I miss you *

1:32:35.599 --> 1:32:39.998
* Can you tell me *

1:32:40.078 --> 1:32:46.437
* Is there something more
to believe in *

1:32:46.477 --> 1:32:53.596
* Or is this all there is *

1:32:57.796 --> 1:33:00.435

1:33:54.548 --> 1:33:57.988
* You came into my room *

1:33:58.068 --> 1:33:59.907
* You took me *

1:33:59.987 --> 1:34:03.747
* Into your arms *

1:34:03.827 --> 1:34:06.467
* Whispering and kissing me *

1:34:06.547 --> 1:34:11.746
* And telling me to still believe *

1:34:13.106 --> 1:34:15.905
* Within the emptiness
of the burning cities *

1:34:15.985 --> 1:34:18.305
* Against which we save
our darkest selves *

1:34:18.385 --> 1:34:20.865
* Until I felt safe *

1:34:20.945 --> 1:34:22.944
* And warm *

1:34:23.024 --> 1:34:26.144
* I fell asleep in your arms *

1:34:26.224 --> 1:34:28.384
* And when I awoke *

1:34:28.464 --> 1:34:30.623
* I cried again *

1:34:30.703 --> 1:34:32.543
* For you were gone *

1:34:36.143 --> 1:34:41.022

* Your tears won't fall *

1:35:28.376 --> 1:35:36.655
* Forever **

1:35:54.092 --> 1:35:58.972
* Driving faster in my car *

1:36:01.931 --> 1:36:07.450
* Falling farther
from just what we are *

1:36:09.770 --> 1:36:14.169
* Smoke a cigarette
and lie some more *

1:36:14.249 --> 1:36:17.569
* These conversations kill *

1:36:17.609 --> 1:36:23.128
* Falling faster in my car *

1:36:24.808 --> 1:36:27.448
* Time to take her home *

1:36:27.528 --> 1:36:31.927
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *

1:36:32.007 --> 1:36:34.967
* Time to take a ride *

1:36:35.047 --> 1:36:39.446
* It leaves today
no conversation *

1:36:39.526 --> 1:36:42.366
* Time to take her home *

1:36:42.406 --> 1:36:46.925
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *

1:36:47.005 --> 1:36:51.884
* Time to wait too long
to wait too long *

1:36:51.964 --> 1:36:55.564
* Way too long **
