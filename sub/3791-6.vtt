01:17.953 --> 01:20.747
There is nothing
more important to a man

01:20.831 --> 01:22.957
than his family.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.125
These men,

01:24.209 --> 01:27.003
these men of honor,

01:27.087 --> 01:30.089
they too are my family.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.925
La Familia Corleone.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.804
I now invite you

01:36.889 --> 01:40.892
to be reborn as one of us.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.894
Thanks, bro.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.063
You are now one
of our qualified men.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.983
Good for you, kid.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.865
Look at this kid.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.325
You know this is the closest
you're ever gonna come

01:57.409 --> 01:59.118
to working with
an Academy Award winner?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.578
Yeah, nice try, Turtle.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.622
But I guess the three episodes
of "A Different World"

02:02.706 --> 02:06.042
that I did with Marisa Tomei
were just a figment of my imagination?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.502
Try to imagine yourself
getting off this game.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.127
You've been on it
all fucking day.

02:09.213 --> 02:12.465
Hold on, E, let me ask the Boss
of All Bosses if I can roll with you.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.592
Come on, Johnny.
Even Capone takes a night off

02:14.676 --> 02:17.470
- to hang out with his boys.
- Yeah, you're right.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.639
Hang on,
let me get my jacket.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.350
- There you go.
- Ooh!

02:23.435 --> 02:25.102
You know, Ari hasn't
called me all day.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.396
He's been your agent
for 24 hours, Drama, relax.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.941
Don't feel bad, Johnny.
He hasn't called me today either...

02:30.025 --> 02:32.902
and I told the president of Warner's
to go fuck himself last night.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.238
Look, he'll call both of you when he
has something to tell you.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.114
Can we not talk business
tonight, please?

02:37.199 --> 02:40.159
This is supposed to be a hang-loose,
get-fucked-up, guys' night out.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.995
That's exactly what it's gonna be.
Just the four of us.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.540
Hey!
- Hi.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.502
- How are you? Hi.
- Hi.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.128
Hi, guys.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.547
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.175
So what? You can't have a fun
guys' night out with me?

02:56.260 --> 02:57.969
We love you, Sloan,
you know that...

02:58.053 --> 03:00.346
But... it's the law.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.599
You don't invite your girl
on a boys' night out.

03:03.934 --> 03:07.270
Okay, in fairness to E, he had no idea
I was gonna be here tonight.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.772
Yeah, pull this leg and
it plays "Jingle Bells. "

03:09.940 --> 03:11.858
I'm serious.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.318
My girlfriend's in town from D.C.
She's meeting me here.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.445
Yeah?
What does she look like?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.948
It's guys' night out.
Don't worry about that.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.450
Oooh, touchÃ©.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.203
Vince?

03:24.621 --> 03:27.039
- Dibbs.
- That's not her.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.541
Hi.
- Hi.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.668
Do you remember me?
You bought me a birthday drink

03:30.752 --> 03:33.838
- a couple of months ago.
- Vodka tonic and 25, right?

03:33.922 --> 03:36.507
Right. How about I return
the favor and buy you one?

03:36.675 --> 03:39.302
Absolutely.
Come sit, join us.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.596
What's next?
You got a girl coming too?

03:41.680 --> 03:44.181
It's Ari.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.059
Hey, Ari, how was
dinner with Alan?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.020
Ask him if he
found me a job yet.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.731
Dinner was great.
Tell Drama he's on my to-do list

03:51.815 --> 03:54.233
right after inserting
needles in my cock.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.943
Put Vince on.
I got big news

03:56.028 --> 03:57.862
and I don't want you
taking all the credit for it.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.614
Vince is busy, Ari.
Talk.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.741
Alan felt so bad
about last night

04:01.825 --> 04:05.077
he wants to bump Vince up
to $10 million for A2.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.455
Interesting. Alan's moving up to 10,
what do you think?

04:07.539 --> 04:08.831
I think
the number's 20.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.000
- We're holding at 20.
- Put Vince on.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.126
He wants to talk to you.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.503
Tell him Alan's a liar
and I don't deal with liars.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.173
Why don't we go to the bar so we don't
have to wait for the waitress?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.676
We can always go to my place so we don't
have to wait for a bartender.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.263
We'll catch
you guys later, huh?

04:24.348 --> 04:25.806
- Tell him.
- He wants you to tell Alan...

04:25.891 --> 04:27.934
Yeah yeah, I heard him.
Just put him on the phone, E.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.268
- He's gone, Ari.
- Eric...

04:29.353 --> 04:32.438
we do not want to get
on Alan Gray's bad side.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.606
What do you
want me to tell you?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.441
Put him on the phone,
you fucking dick!

04:35.525 --> 04:37.568
I'm not a guy you want
on your bad side.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.071
- Really? What are you gonna do?
- This.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.531
Whoa whoa, he didn't
want to talk to me?

04:43.575 --> 04:45.117
This night is
a total disaster.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.744
All of a sudden
we're on E's date.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.789
- You wanna blow out?
- Yeah, come on.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.957
You guys
are leaving?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.501
- Yeah.
- Hey!

04:53.585 --> 04:56.212
- Oh my God, hi, Tori. Oh!
- Hi, baby.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.966
Maybe it will salvage
this night after all.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.968
Hi, it's Johnny Drama.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.302
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Tori. Nice to meet you.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.470
- Turtle.
- Hey.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.475
- The girl was cold.
- Ice cold.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.769
What, because you guys
couldn't close?

05:11.853 --> 05:14.146
Couldn't close...
she said she doesn't date.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.648
Brad Pitt
couldn't close her.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.317
Did you hear what she said
when I offered to buy her a drink?

05:18.402 --> 05:19.986
- No, what?
- "No thank you. "

05:20.070 --> 05:22.321
What a bitch.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.033
All right, guys.
This is Sloan, so stop.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.828
- Didn't we just see her?
- How whipped is this guy?

05:28.912 --> 05:31.706
- Hey, babe.
- Hi, babe.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.124
You guys sound drunk.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.500
You weren't drunk
when I left you.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.294
- Huh, we're having a good time now.
- Good.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.796
Tell him.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.507
Oh, um...
Tori wants me to tell you

05:41.591 --> 05:43.676
that it was really
nice meeting you.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.302
Aw, tell her it was
nice meeting her too.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.139
She wants me to tell you
she thinks you're really cute.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.558
Cute?
That's cool.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.767
Who's cute?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.936
- Tell him the other thing.
- No.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.230
Yes! Here, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.149
Okay okay.
Okay, wait.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.316
Does she think
one of us is cute?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.651
- Eric?
- Yes, Sloan?

06:00.777 --> 06:04.113
Tori wants to tell you
that she wants to have a threesome

06:04.197 --> 06:05.906
with me and you.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.992
Sleep on that, E.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.703
Okay, we gotta go.
I love you. Bye, babe.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.621
Sloan?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.168
- What's up?
- She like one of us or not?

06:17.252 --> 06:19.003
I thought you guys
didn't like her.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.047
- I loved her.
- Yeah, me too.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.299
She's smokin'.
So who'd she say was cute?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.011
Me.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.179
You.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.389
Why would she tell Sloan
she thinks you're cute?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.892
They're drunk. She told Sloan we should
have a threesome.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.685
So why aren't you
in your car right now?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.228
'Cause they're fucked up
and it's a joke.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.398
- No woman should ever joke about that!
- No, they should not.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.233
Either way,
I'm so whackin' off

06:41.318 --> 06:43.069
- to your girlfriend tonight.
- Loser.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.071
I was planning on whackin' off
to Vince's girl,

06:45.155 --> 06:46.697
but this definitely tops that.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.292
Hello.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.252
Hey, Johnny,
I have Ari for Vince.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.171
Vince is sleeping,
but I'll talk to Ari.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.632
Vince isn't available,
but I have Drama.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.093
I don't wanna talk to Drama,
I wanna talk to Vince.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.844
Sorry, Drama,
I don't have Ari anymore.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.387
You just had him
for Vince.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.516
But then you told me that Vince
was sleeping and now I lost him.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.894
Tell Vince to please call Ari when
he wakes up and I'll have him again.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.854
Oh, Vince just walked in.
You got Ari now?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.981
I have Vince now.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.192
I have Ari.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.862
Can I say that you won't talk to Ari
unless he talks to me?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.032
Hey, Ari?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.243
- Vince.
- Here's Johnny.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.788
- Yeah.
- What do you need, Drama?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.124
- I need a job, Ari.
- I'll see what I can do.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.333
Do better than that.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.085
How?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
Promise you'll see
what you can do.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.338
Drama...

07:44.422 --> 07:47.091
Promise, or I'm not
gonna put Vince on.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.886
I promise
I will do all I can for you.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.558
Sorry, I had him
but now I don't.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.854
Ari left three
messages on my cell.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.274
He was just on the phone. He's probably
freakin' about the Warner's call.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.569
Can you imagine the look on Alan's face
when Ari says no to 10?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.821
Don't fuck with
the boys from P.S. 154.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.948
Speaking of fucking,
did he tell you

08:11.074 --> 08:13.367
- what Sloan said last night?
- No, what'd she say?

08:13.535 --> 08:15.327
Why did I think you guys would forget
about that today?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.746
I don't know, 'cause I was up thinking
about it all night.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.498
- Like you weren't.
- What'd she say?

08:19.583 --> 08:23.961
Sloan and Tori want E to be the meat
in their girl-girl sandwich.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.713
No! Is it true?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.590
- What do you think?
- I think you'd enjoy it.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.966
You know Sloan, you think
she'd do that?

08:29.050 --> 08:32.845
E, I have a little theory
that all women love other women.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.847
That's probably
because I love all women.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.974
She was really drunk and it
will never happen, trust me.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.268
Well, drunk or not,
she wouldn't have put it

08:39.352 --> 08:40.977
out there if it
wasn't a possibility.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.688
Exactly. You might have
to push her a little.

08:43.773 --> 08:48.027
Yeah, E, are you man enough
to push, hmm?

08:48.904 --> 08:51.030
- I'm man enough to leave.
- Off to see Sloan?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.907
Gee, I wonder what
you're gonna talk about.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.659
- See you guys later.
- Hey, take this seriously.

08:55.744 --> 08:58.746
When opportunity knocks
let her the fuck in.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.122
And for God's sakes,

09:00.207 --> 09:02.374
let her go down
on your girlfriend!

09:05.295 --> 09:09.381
Yes, Alan, yes, listen... you've been
more than generous, more than generous.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.009
You know actors.
Crazy comes with the territory.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.303
I understand, Ari.
But if this nonsense

09:14.429 --> 09:17.223
continues much longer
I might get mad.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.058
Believe me, Alan,
I more than anyone else

09:19.142 --> 09:20.517
do not want
to get you mad.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.479
I have seen you
on the racquetball court.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.565
Listen, I know that franchises
do not grow on trees.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.069
I will call Vince myself
and tell him how mad I will be

09:30.153 --> 09:31.528
if he tries
to pull a Chappelle.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.657
Fantastic.
I like your new attitude, Ari.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.700
You should have moved
to a boutique agency years ago.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.745
- Thank you, sir.
- Anyway,

09:39.829 --> 09:42.331
I'm willing to go up to $12
and a half million to wrap this up.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.167
12 and a half...

09:45.252 --> 09:46.418
But Ari,

09:46.503 --> 09:49.713
wrapped up means
you call me... today

09:50.131 --> 09:52.758
- by 4:00.
- Lloyd, get Vince on the phone!

09:52.842 --> 09:56.428
- Give me the only answer that I want.
- Alan,

09:56.805 --> 09:59.515
- Alan.
- Yes, Ari.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.350
Consider it done.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.018
- Ari?
- Yes, Alan?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.021
It better be.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.315
Lloyd!

10:08.400 --> 10:11.860
- Do you have Vince?
- No, I have Drama

10:12.028 --> 10:15.072
and he says that he's been
authorized to tell you that Vince

10:15.156 --> 10:17.783
will not speak to you
until he, Drama, has a job.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.829
- Really?
- Really.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.885
Question: Uh,
no lox at staff meetings now, Ari?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.887
Cost cutting until we
get into the new offices.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.140
There will be lox
in the new year, trust me.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.101
Until then, enjoy the gourmet
chicken salad.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.103
Anyway, people,

10:46.187 --> 10:47.813
staff meeting
has been canceled.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.065
You all have
one goal today:

10:50.400 --> 10:52.401
To get
Vincent Chase's brother

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
Johnny Chase a job.
Any job.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.365
I don't care if it's a porn shoot
in which he is being

10:58.450 --> 11:01.327
gang-raped by a gaggle
of silverback apes.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.120
If there are
cameras rolling

11:03.330 --> 11:06.332
everybody wins.
10 grand to anyone

11:06.416 --> 11:08.334
that can deliver this
to me today.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.051
Can I vie for the 10 grand
prize also, Ari?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.344
Sure, but you'll
get paid in yen.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.804
Now try E one more
fucking time.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.890
There's another
e- mail.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.100
Hmm, what does
this one say?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.020
"You drunken, Irish,
short, midget cocksucker,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.855
I need someone
to call me back. "

11:29.939 --> 11:31.315
He sounds angry.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.651
- Yeah.
- So what are you gonna do?

11:34.736 --> 11:37.029
There's nothing to do.
Vince is a man of principle.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.740
He feels he was lied to.
It's not about the money, so...

11:40.784 --> 11:43.911
So.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.996
So what else?

11:46.998 --> 11:48.791
What else?
How are you feeling today?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.501
I'm okay, why?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.294
You guys were pretty
hammered last night.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.296
- We weren't that bad.
- You weren't?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.840
Is there something
you'd like to say?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.635
No.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.305
We were joking.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.225
That's a mean joke.
You shouldn't tease a guy like that.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.936
- Like you would do it.
- Oh, I'd do it.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.021
If you were
okay with it.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.148
I mean who wouldn't do it?
Why wouldn't I do it...

12:13.233 --> 12:15.275
if you were
okay with it?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.862
Have you ever done
anything like that?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.489
No, have you?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.199
What do you think?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.160
I think, no. And I don't think
you ever would.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.246
Are you challenging me?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.498
No, I'm not saying it in a bad way,
I just don't think you would.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.460
I would.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.338
With you, once.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.173
Once would be great.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.051
And I'd have some rules...

12:41.136 --> 12:44.471
No no no no no.
No rules.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.932
- I agree. Call it off, E.
- Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.935
A threesome with rules
is not a threesome. It's a nightmare.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.603
I don't even know why
I told you guys this.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.355
This is between me and my girlfriend.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.025
No, this is between you, your girlfriend
and a complete stranger.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.610
Of course you tell
your best friends.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.070
We might have some
wisdom to impart.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.448
The only threesome you guys have ever
had involved each other.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.533
I don't want any of that
wisdom imparted.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.827
- Vince, talk to him.
- All right, what's the rule?

13:06.911 --> 13:10.080
- What's the difference?
- You can't have sex with Tori.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.791
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.918
What are we doing?
I thought we're going to Book Soup.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.629
That was a ruse.
This is gonna happen.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.590
We gotta get you
prepared, baby.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.050
Grab a basket.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.677
What, are we
in Pathmark?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.179
Alan's on one.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.222
It's only 3:30.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.392
- Um, I have 3:30 too.
- I'm supposed to have until 4:00.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.104
Tell him that you are looking for me
and you will find me soon.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.564
You are quite
sure of it. Go.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.567
And then you get E
and Vince on the phone now.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.365
- Seriously, how did you know?
- Because Sloan's a good girl.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.284
This is really
just experimental.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.328
Eh, more selfish
than anything.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.996
How is it selfish,
Drama?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.789
Because she gets
the whole experience.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.333
You only get
to play the first half,

13:54.417 --> 13:56.126
- then you gotta hit the bench.
- It is bullshit.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.712
No, guys this is
a good thing, trust me.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.880
Look,
I've had threesomes

13:59.964 --> 14:02.049
where both girls wanna
watch me with the other,

14:02.133 --> 14:03.926
and I've had threesomes
where I have one girl

14:04.010 --> 14:06.136
who I need to be
a little more protective of.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.764
In the long run, the girl you have
to be more protective of

14:08.848 --> 14:11.141
is the girl you wanna be
in a relationship with.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.894
Not the girl who's begging you
to bang her best friend.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.521
Look,
Sloan's a good girl.

14:15.772 --> 14:16.855
You'll have a good time.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.399
But make sure she knows
she's the one in first position.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.943
And definitely
get one of these.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.029
What? There's no rule Sloan
can't fuck her, is there?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.698
Would you turn that
fucking ringer off already?

14:26.908 --> 14:29.535
- How long can we ignore him?
- I'll take it.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.161
Hello.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.040
I'm workin' on stuff, Drama.
I'll get back to you.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.505
Anyone make any progress
getting Johnny Chase a job?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.674
I've got some calls in.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.135
Any agents in the building
have any calls in?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.303
Somebody

14:48.388 --> 14:51.139
better do fucking something
or tomorrow

14:51.224 --> 14:54.059
you will be working
for fucking Lloyd!

14:55.770 --> 14:57.646
Ari Gold's office.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.526
$12.5 million and no one
will talk to me!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.611
Nobody will talk to me?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.031
It's Alan.
I think he'll talk to you.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.616
Ari!
That's a rental!

15:09.701 --> 15:11.159
That's a rental!

15:14.289 --> 15:16.540
No, can't do...!

15:20.461 --> 15:21.670
Alan, how are you?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.882
Well, it's 4:02 and I'm
making my own calls. How do I sound?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.093
Do you have
the answer that I want?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.345
I... I'm actually just
trying to locate Vince. He...

15:30.430 --> 15:33.181
- Let me ask you a question, Ari.
- Yeah.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.935
What are you gonna do
when you can't locate me?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.605
What are you gonna do
when I shut this place down

15:39.689 --> 15:42.399
to you and everyone you know?
How are you gonna like

15:42.483 --> 15:45.027
explaining to the rest of your clients
that one of the largest

15:45.111 --> 15:47.904
studios in the world
no longer exists?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.033
Would... I wouldn't
like that, Alan...

15:51.117 --> 15:53.118
Let me propose
something to you, Ari.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.037
Something you can
present to that...

15:55.121 --> 15:57.789
pretty boy client of yours,
if and when you find him.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.000
- Okay... I'm listening.
- Oh...

16:00.293 --> 16:01.877
I'm quite sure you are.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.765
- Look at this guy.
- Fancy.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.266
What, are you going
to your senior prom?

16:16.601 --> 16:18.352
- Fuck off.
- The maitre d' from Dakota

16:18.436 --> 16:19.978
- called to confirm.
- Dakota, huh?

16:20.063 --> 16:22.230
Leave it to this guy to wine
and dine a threesome.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.526
It's from my private reserve.
Just in case you have a problem

16:26.611 --> 16:28.654
getting it started,
that'll warm everybody up.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.322
I know you're not a big porn guy,

16:30.406 --> 16:32.824
but the innovations since
the DVD are pretty amazing.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.451
Remember back in the day
you'd be tuggin' it

16:34.535 --> 16:37.329
and they'd cut to a closeup of the guy's
face and you wanted to kill yourself?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.581
Never again.
Multi-angles.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.834
- Good tip, Turtle.
- Turtle, grab a picture.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.671
This is before.
You better bring home the after.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.593
- You got the girls picking you up?
- What, no limo, E?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.349
This must be serious.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.893
- He brought his muscle.
- Hey, Johnny, go deal.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.270
Hey, you better get out of here.
The girls are waiting.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.189
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll call Sloan, we'll hook up later.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.358
Don't be nervous, you've done it before.
Now you're doing it twice.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.486
I'm not nervous.
I'm not abandoning you with Ari.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.446
Unless Alan came up to 20,
there's not really much to talk about.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.950
- Go ahead, have a good time.
- For all of us.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.662
- You sure?
- E, you better go or I will.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.333
Hey... oh, and E,

17:24.042 --> 17:26.294
- lose the jacket.
- You think?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.587
Uh-huh.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.136
- You got something for me, Ari?
- I don't have a job.

17:34.804 --> 17:39.015
- Then I can't let you pass.
- Even if I got you a good audition?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.146
- Even if Lloyd did?
- What do you got?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.022
It's a pilot
Eddie Burns is producing.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.276
Eddie Burns? I used to play ball with
Eddie Burns. He loves me.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.570
It's four young
Irish boys in New York.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.197
- I'm Irish from New York.
- And you were once young.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.368
It's the older brother.
- This sounds perfect.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.245
And if you book it
I get 10,000 bucks.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.205
Yen, Lloyd, 10,000 yen.
Can I come in?

18:02.290 --> 18:05.417
Eh, not so fast.
You handed me off to Lloyd.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.086
One day, one audition.
Complain tomorrow, Drama.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.381
- Later, Ari.
- E, Vince better not be in that car!

18:11.758 --> 18:14.426
- I'm right here, Ari.
- Oh.

18:16.179 --> 18:20.265
Hey, bear with me, Lloyd, I wanna hear
your big-picture strategy.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.600
All right, I'm listening,
what's up?

18:21.684 --> 18:26.188
I just would like to ask you if you have
a plan here, you know?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.607
Because if you do,
I would love to hear it.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.067
- A plan?
- A plan for what you want.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.528
For instance, if Alan
offered you $20 million,

18:33.696 --> 18:34.946
would that make you happy?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.615
Ari, you know
it's not about the money.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.784
- What is it then?
- I want the days he promised.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.285
- I wanna do "Medellin. "
- Vin...

18:40.369 --> 18:43.705
And if he does that,
I will do "Aquaman 2" for free.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.290
- It's not...
- I swear to God.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.542
It's not gonna happen, Vince,
it's not going to happen.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.546
"Medellin" is done.
They made an offer to Benicio.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.638
Alan owns your ass.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.976
He fucked me, Ari.
To my face.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.646
I'm sorry he lied to you.
This is the world we live in.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.608
He also offered you
$12.5 million in compensation.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.277
He didn't have to do that. You have
to stop doing what you're doing.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.363
All right?
Because if you don't,

19:16.572 --> 19:19.950
he will sue you.
He will take everything you have.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.786
He'll take the house,
the cars, maybe even Turtle.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.288
I don't care about any of that...
except Turtle.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.414
Thanks, Vince.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.792
It's over, I'm sorry.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.544
You have no other choice.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.379
Do you understand?

19:32.463 --> 19:35.715
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.594
Tomorrow, breakfast on the lot,
we make amends.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.391
- I'm not going to breakfast.
- Vinnie...

19:44.475 --> 19:46.434
Alan just wants
to look you in the face

19:46.519 --> 19:49.312
and he wants you to tell him
you're gonna honor the contract.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.649
- No more grief, we move on...
- Ari, listen to me.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.443
I'm not going to any fucking breakfast.
You can tell Alan

19:55.528 --> 19:59.239
I will show up every day and I will bust
my ass like I've always done.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.949
But I don't want
the $12.5 million.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.785
I want the seven
that we agreed upon.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.662
I don't want to be indebted
to some douchebag.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.414
Vinnie, he has other movies.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.332
I don't care!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.167
I'll never work
with him again anyway.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.003
I don't care if he offers me
a billion dollars.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.963
- Do you understand?
- Vince!

20:15.089 --> 20:17.132
I'm done.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.846
Kid's got principles, huh?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.515
Where's the fucking manager
when I need him?

20:25.600 --> 20:27.601
Huh.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.147
So your parents must be happy having
you home for the weekend.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.648
Oh, they're
not around anymore.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.775
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's horrible.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.653
Oh no, baby, they're not dead,
they just retired to Flagstaff.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.531
Oh, that's cool.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.410
- It's so cute how nervous he is.
- Nervous? I'm not nervous.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.162
It's okay,
you don't have to be.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.372
Okay, Tori,
you're freaking him out.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.918
- And you're so calm, Sloan?
- TORl: You're both nervous.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.545
And it's cute.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.718
We're gonna
need to get drunk.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.595
- Definitely.
- Yes.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.930
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.996
I'm just kidding.

22:19.130 --> 22:23.299
Ari, look, we're all very happy that
Vince finally came to his senses.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.218
But how did you manage
to talk him off the ledge?

22:25.302 --> 22:27.137
It was very simple, Dana.
I actually told him

22:27.221 --> 22:29.139
that he would have
to fuck you if he didn't.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.599
- You're such an asshole.
- What? There he is.

22:31.976 --> 22:35.020
- How are you, Alan?
- Where's your client, Ari?

22:35.438 --> 22:38.106
Oh, we're all good.
Listen, it's a done deal.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.483
Vince feels
so bad about this

22:40.568 --> 22:43.028
he said forget about the 12.5,
he'll do it for the 10.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.404
Oh.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.406
But he wouldn't come
to a breakfast with me?

22:46.490 --> 22:48.491
- No, it's not that.
- These fucking actors,

22:48.576 --> 22:49.909
they think they have
all the power.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.746
- Alan, Vince is a good kid.
- Fuck Vince, Ari.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.039
And fuck you.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.255
Okay, then.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.600
Yeah, Ari,
what's the problem?

23:13.684 --> 23:17.020
The problem is, I needed you last night
to talk some sense into Vince.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.105
I spoke to Vince. He told me everything
was under control.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.191
You told him to skip
that breakfast meeting?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.651
What breakfast? Vince didn't tell me
about any breakfast.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.779
Alan wanted one,
Vince wouldn't go.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.740
Jesus. You know what?
I'm pulling up to the house right now.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.450
I'll have him call Alan
and apologize.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.202
You know, what?
It's too late for sorries.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.497
Vince is out.
Jake Gyllenhaal is in.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.583
"Brokeback motherfucking Aquaman. "
Take that bitch.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.919
Read about it
in the papers tomorrow,

23:41.003 --> 23:45.673
but pass it along to Vince or Drama
or whoever will talk to you now.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.518
All net, all net.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.608
So how was it?
- Talk, E.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.026
Come on, E,
what you got?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.319
Nothing good.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.279
What? Sloan wouldn't
let you fuck her either?

24:08.364 --> 24:10.365
Did you have a breakfast
with Alan this morning and didn't show?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.909
- I told Ari I wasn't going.
- But you never told me.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.328
- Fuck Alan.
- Actually no, Vince.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.955
We're the ones
that are fucked.
