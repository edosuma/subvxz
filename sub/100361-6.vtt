00:49.674 --> 00:53.261
As you both know, I have just completed
the market research

00:53.344 --> 00:56.347
for our new product, the Rise Up,

00:56.931 --> 01:00.226
brought to you by the people
who brought you Ménage à Moi.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.936
We know that. We're those people.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.147
Please save your questions until the end.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.648
That wasn't a question.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.567
And you've just lost
your question privileges.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.862
Shh. I don't want us to get thrown out.

01:10.945 --> 01:14.532
When presented with the word "toilet,"

01:14.616 --> 01:17.285
the response from customers at Costco,

01:17.368 --> 01:20.497
uh, varied from... "Gross,"

01:20.580 --> 01:21.831
"Not sexy,"

01:22.207 --> 01:23.833
"Get away from me now,"

01:24.167 --> 01:26.044
and, "Where's the rotisserie chicken?"

01:26.127 --> 01:27.712
Not great toilet news.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.715
But where is the chicken in that place?

01:30.799 --> 01:34.052
Unfortunately, the words "privy,"

01:34.135 --> 01:37.055
"loo," "commode," and "shitter"

01:37.138 --> 01:39.682
all tested better than the word "toilet."

01:39.766 --> 01:42.811
-Shitter beat toilet?
-Not the way you say it.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.230
"Shitta" beat toilet.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.689
Hmm, I can see that.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.234
Well, I'm... I'm afraid, ladies,
we're sunk.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.694
[Grace] No, we're not.
It's hard to market.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.821
It's a toilet.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.074
You know, if it was easy,
every joker would be making one.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.243
Well, we do have some good news.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.455
This outfit tested very highly
for your date tonight,

02:02.539 --> 02:07.502
especially in your target demo
of men age 21 to 99.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.838
You had her test your date outfit?

02:09.921 --> 02:13.133
Look, I've been texting and flirting
with Jack for weeks.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.218
I've set the stage.

02:15.301 --> 02:19.931
But now I've got to go out and be
Lady Gaga, because this guy is cool.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.560
What do you mean? You're always
the cool one in a relationship.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.019
You told me yourself.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.939
I tell you lots of things, Grace.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.359
He already likes you enough
to give you a Jerry Garcia sneaker.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.112
-Hmm.
-Isn't that Deadhead for "I'm into you"?

02:34.195 --> 02:38.616
Yes, but he went out
with Carole King <i>and</i> Carol Kane.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.412
Wow, you really are nervous.

02:42.495 --> 02:47.375
I am. I went on a mock date with Coyote,
and it did not go well.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.713
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.093
It's just that an egg white omelet

02:57.177 --> 02:59.679
would've been the healthier option
for you, that's all.

02:59.762 --> 03:04.184
That's some banana split calling
the omelet unhealthy right there.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.810
I'm not familiar with that saying.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.021
I'm not the one having surgery in a week.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.439
Correct. I am.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.943
And I don't think a few egg yolks
are going to change my prognosis.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.905
Stop! Are tomatoes bad now? Let me check.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.449
-"Are tomatoes bad now?"
-[keyboard clacking]

03:19.824 --> 03:21.034
Oh, yes. They are.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.869
Wait. No, that's from 2014, hold on.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.456
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.499
ad, scrolling.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.460
Okay, tomatoes are good to go.
He's fine.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.961
-You're fine.
-Wait!

03:32.045 --> 03:35.215
Carcinogens.
Aren't there carcinogens in coffee?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.759
I think there are. Good save, Robert.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.720
You want Bud to rub your feet?
Bud, can you rub his feet?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.388
-On it.
-No!

03:42.889 --> 03:44.224
Stay away from my feet!

03:44.307 --> 03:49.395
This, right here, is why I didn't want
anyone to know about my surgery.

03:49.938 --> 03:50.897
Where are you going?

03:50.980 --> 03:55.068
To the cancer support group
the doctor told us about.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.194
Oh, that's a great idea.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.196
We support that. [chuckles] Right, Robert?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.281
Yes, we do. You need one of us--

04:03.785 --> 04:05.411
-Guess he's all set.
-Hmm.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.873
-You just sticking around or--
-Yep. On my way out.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.670
[keyboard clacking]

04:14.921 --> 04:16.714
[Mallory] Have you seen the stapler?

04:17.757 --> 04:18.716
Yep.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.761
Could you tell me where it is?

04:21.844 --> 04:23.137
Why don't I just leave it on the printer,

04:23.221 --> 04:25.014
and then when you're firing off
another cover letter,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.224
it'll be right there for you.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.059
Okay.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.478
Then, here's your report.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.859
[slight chuckle] Slice.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.738
[clears throat] You know, cut the tension.
[nervous chuckle]

04:40.822 --> 04:44.242
-What do you need, Barry?
-Right. Every department's out of paper,

04:44.325 --> 04:47.328
and everyone's too afraid
to come in and get it.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.789
Does everyone need to print
their résumés now?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.375
I-I don't know.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.501
[sighs]

04:54.168 --> 04:55.503
I'll bring them some.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.678
Quick, Barry, rip a fart in her fort.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
-I can't.
-Oh, now you can't?

05:06.848 --> 05:10.059
So, seems like this sister-fight's
winding down,

05:10.143 --> 05:15.231
and everything's gonna be sort of resolved
by, say, Friday 7:00 p.m.? [chuckles]

05:15.690 --> 05:16.524
Why?

05:18.192 --> 05:21.112
Ugh. Not going on a double date
with her and Dan.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.780
But the-- the short rib.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.158
What is it with you and that short rib?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.702
[scoffs] The short rib is legendary.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.830
Like... you know it received
several thousand votes for mayor?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.875
And you have to pay for it in advance,
which I did.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.879
And they won't seat less than four people
at the table. I already checked.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.715
Okay, fine. We'll just go
with another couple.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.635
Never mind. I'll just cancel
the fucking reservation, I guess.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.889
Barry, you don't think I can find
someone else to go with us?

05:47.972 --> 05:51.225
No, you know, I don't think you can find
two people to go with us.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.439
-What about--?
-Bud and Coyote? Not officially a couple.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.524
-Erin and Liz?
-Vegetarians.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.194
Of course. We have tons
of other couple friends.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.988
-And you've alienated all of them.
-Not Mark and Cindy.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.281
You mean Mike and Sandy?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.866
Is... Is that their names?

06:06.949 --> 06:10.244
This is why we need Dan and Mallory.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.330
They're our only couple friends.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.166
They were our only couple friends,
until Mallory betrayed me.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.250
You know what?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.253
Make up with your sister
or find another couple.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.382
My mom and Nick?

06:23.007 --> 06:24.884
-Yes.
-Ew, no.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.141
Hey, hey, hey.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.062
Well, well. Someone must have had
a good time on their date.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.063
I did.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.606
I think.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.277
I mean, the ride there was fun.
And the ride home was great.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.531
Oh, no. Well, the date was bad?

06:46.614 --> 06:49.325
Well, there's no way to know at this time.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.953
-[speaking indistinctly]
-[music plays loudly, people chattering]

06:52.036 --> 06:54.372
It's just a default setting for them.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.833
What did you just say?

06:58.126 --> 07:00.002
...T-shirt cannon... [indistinct]

07:00.253 --> 07:02.088
Whatever... no reason...

07:02.171 --> 07:03.589
[speaks indistinctly]

07:05.842 --> 07:08.553
I'm sorry, one more time.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.516
I couldn't bring any
because of the straitjacket.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.351
[laughs]

07:19.021 --> 07:21.065
You couldn't hear him the entire night?

07:21.149 --> 07:24.652
Well, I heard bits and pieces.
What I heard, I liked.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.696
Frankie, I want to thank you for tonight.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.324
I want to thank you for letting me
take my shoes off in here.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.534
[laughs]

07:31.993 --> 07:35.413
I know what I told you
isn't exactly what everybody

07:35.496 --> 07:37.123
would talk about on a first date.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.459
I'm not everybody.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.877
No, you're not.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.089
I've never been on a date with someone
who fills up on mints from the host stand.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.633
Why would they have them
up at the entrance

07:47.717 --> 07:50.052
if they didn't want you
to start with them?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.139
Well, you know,
the entrance is also the exit.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.767
-You're blowing my mind right now.
-[both chuckle]

07:56.851 --> 07:59.479
Wait, go back. What did he tell you?

07:59.979 --> 08:03.941
"The entrance is also the exit."

08:04.025 --> 08:06.402
No. I-I know that. Everybody knows that.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.071
The thing you normally don't say
on a first date.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.573
I'm getting there.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.241
Ah, I got to tell you,

08:12.617 --> 08:14.994
part of the reason I haven't been out
with anyone in so long

08:15.077 --> 08:18.039
is that I've been ashamed
to talk about it, for obvious reasons.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.373
Loud and clear.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.502
And you're a really great listener.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.213
-I really am.
-Mm-hmm.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.631
In fact, I would gladly listen

08:26.714 --> 08:29.800
to that thing you told me
in the restaurant.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.219
Again, right now.

08:31.302 --> 08:32.803
[laughs]

08:33.221 --> 08:34.764
I can't wait till Thursday.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.015
Thursday?

08:36.098 --> 08:40.436
Our second date, which I think
we discussed in that too-loud restaurant.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.938
Was it too loud,

08:42.522 --> 08:46.317
or have you just needed hearing aids
for years and refused to accept it?

08:46.400 --> 08:50.571
How can I be the cool one
in the relationship with a hearing aid?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.449
Besides, they've never once
gone with my outfit.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.410
Now, an ear trumpet, on the other hand...

08:56.494 --> 09:00.122
You sold me on the Rise Up when you said,

09:00.206 --> 09:02.708
"Don't be ashamed of something you need."

09:02.792 --> 09:03.793
Did I?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.754
I can't hear most of what I say
these days.

09:06.837 --> 09:11.175
That's a blessing. But do you really want
to start your relationship like this?

09:11.259 --> 09:15.137
I don't want to spook Jack
with every little flaw right away.

09:15.471 --> 09:20.518
Besides, he thinks I'm accepting, chill,
and a bitchin' listener.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.938
-Well, you are. You're just a bad hear-er.
-Hmm.

09:24.021 --> 09:28.234
Okay, let's try to piece together what
he might have said in that restaurant.

09:29.193 --> 09:34.156
At one point he did say,
"Tonight, we have a lovely clam linguine."

09:34.490 --> 09:36.033
That was the waiter.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.828
[muffled] Could be.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.129
-[Robert] Hi.
-Hi.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.924
Do you need help with that?
Sometimes they can be tricky.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.094
No, I can take my jacket off myself,
thanks.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.389
Just making sure you know
I'm here for you, whatever you need.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.683
I know. Thanks.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.435
So, how was your support group?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.021
It was great. Really fun.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.440
Talking about cancer was fun?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.901
People with cancer
make their own kind of fun.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.322
Well, I'm really very proud of you
for going.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.657
Maybe next time I could go with you.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.786
Oh, no, it's not
for family members. Sorry.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.664
Oh.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.918
Well, then I-I guess it's better to talk
to people who are going through it.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.045
Yeah.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.883
In fact, there's another one on Thursday.
I'm going to go.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.134
Okay.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.929
And maybe afterwards,
you can tell me all about it.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.848
Oh. Robert...

10:41.766 --> 10:44.477
the first rule of cancer club is, uh...

10:45.061 --> 10:47.396
well, have cancer.

10:53.277 --> 10:57.114
So, Jack, on Thursday, the day of Thurs,

10:57.198 --> 10:58.991
how long do you think it would take me

10:59.075 --> 11:02.787
to get to, uh, the place
to which we are both going?

11:02.870 --> 11:06.916
Uh, uh, wait, is that surface street time
or highway?

11:06.999 --> 11:09.752
And how fast do you think I drive?
[chuckles]

11:10.670 --> 11:11.796
Just pick her up.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.383
Beach house, 6:00 p.m., no cops.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.261
Ah, thank you. Why didn't I think of that?

11:19.887 --> 11:23.391
Because you didn't go
to Jason Statham's charm school.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.561
Okay, okay, everybody, focus on me. Yo!

11:28.312 --> 11:30.022
So, I was up all night.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.399
Ooh, lucky Nick.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.609
Huh? Oh. Oh, he's fine.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.611
No, I was working.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.613
And do you know what I realized?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.323
I love this.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.201
I love working with you.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.453
Well, right back at you, sister.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.790
I love spinning your bonkers ideas
into gold.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.959
Well, fuck you, sister.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.629
And I figured out
how we're gonna market the Rise Up.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.424
You know how you don't want to freak
Jack out by leading with the negatives?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.467
It's the same thing with Rise Up.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.845
We have to ease people into it,

12:01.178 --> 12:03.889
and then, once they're on board,
boom, toilet.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.309
Just come out and say it: I'm your muse.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.311
Whatever.

12:10.146 --> 12:14.150
We're selling a brand, right?
An idea, not just a toilet.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.737
So our marketing
has to empower older people

12:17.820 --> 12:19.947
while we build a mystique around it.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.366
And then we just blast them
with the toilet.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.909
No, we don't blast anybody.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.455
But you said, "Boom, toilet,"
and nobody batted an eye.

12:27.538 --> 12:32.960
I am not getting into the weeds with you
over "booming" versus "blasting." Again.

12:33.043 --> 12:37.047
So, ladies and ladies,

12:38.174 --> 12:39.759
our teaser campaign.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.262
[Frankie] Now this is sexy.

12:43.345 --> 12:47.933
I would definitely tell you
to buy me whatever this is selling.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.310
This is gonna go online,

12:49.393 --> 12:51.854
and then, hopefully,
people will start to engage with us.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.774
[gasps] Can we also post these
all over town,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.942
like on buildings and overpasses?

12:57.026 --> 12:58.527
[Joan-Margaret] What a great idea.

12:58.611 --> 13:03.073
I have ski masks, a ladder,
and wheat paste in my car.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.452
Well, I suppose we can use that stuff
to hang posters.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.997
[chuckles] Ye...

13:10.456 --> 13:13.042
Yes, of course I'm serious about dinner.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.339
Yes, but I like to think of us as the type
of friends who don't speak for two years

13:18.422 --> 13:21.217
and then just pick up
right where we left off.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.180
Okay, then stop watching
my Instagram stories.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.890
Hey, it's Bri.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.184
Brianna.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.978
Brianna Hanson.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.230
Okay, bye.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.316
You wanted to see me?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.652
Hey, E-dog.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.574
I know it's Erica. I just wanted
to show you how close we are.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.452
-Oh, God, what's happening?
-Nothing!

13:49.245 --> 13:50.246
[pats sofa]

13:52.039 --> 13:53.123
[chuckles]

13:54.917 --> 13:56.669
-This is for you.
-Oh.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.134
I just wanted to see
whatcha doing Friday night.

14:04.218 --> 14:08.097
Um, working late?
Is that the right answer?

14:08.180 --> 14:11.600
The right answer is having fun...
with me and Barry.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.271
Dinner, Friday night, you and your...

14:16.188 --> 14:18.607
girlfriend? Boyfriend?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.734
Please make a face
so I know when I'm close.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.779
I've been married a year. To Pete.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.614
We met here.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.908
Great. So we're on for Friday.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.827
What? Oh, Friday.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.953
I can't.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.371
I'm...

14:32.454 --> 14:34.748
getting an operation.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.333
It's elective.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.168
And I'm electing.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.837
Hmm.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.381
Big bumms,
you're gonna have to reschedule that.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.842
You'll be working late. Now get out.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.888
-[Erica] Barry.
-Hi.

14:51.557 --> 14:56.604
Just had to give Erica a talking-to
about fiscal ointment projections.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.481
You get it.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.567
You tried to get her and Pete
to come to dinner, didn't you?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.319
Who the fuck is Pete?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.782
Oh, here's another good one.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.660
"My boss was trying to get me
to retire early,

15:11.744 --> 15:13.787
but I rose up and refused.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.831
-He ended up giving me a raise."
-Ah!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.291
"Hashtag rise up."

15:17.374 --> 15:19.543
I can't believe this is working.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.087
I can't believe how much hummus
is on your screen.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.130
Oh.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.423
Here's a good one.

15:25.382 --> 15:29.678
"At a restaurant, they only had
those high tables with terrible stools.

15:29.762 --> 15:34.224
But I rose up and demanded a chair
with a back. Hashtag rise up."

15:36.685 --> 15:39.355
I demand a raise. Hashtag rise up.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.397
No.

15:41.023 --> 15:45.402
Well, I've already risen up.
So I guess I'll go and make us some tea.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.572
-[door opens]
-[Coyote] Hello?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.574
-In here.
-[door closes]

15:51.450 --> 15:55.287
I just wanted to stop by and give my dad
this healthy green shake I made.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.123
It's Bud's recipe.
Don't tell him I used it.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.626
-Still fighting over a girl?
-Mm-hmm.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.670
That's great for you two grown men.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.922
Why is the green shake brown?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.174
Oh, a bunch of Ubers canceled on me.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.927
Ugh. I was standing outside for a while.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.595
Where's Dad?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.723
He's with his cancer support group
at the JCC.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.767
-Hmm.
-No idea when he'll be back.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.144
Oh, I-I sometimes go
to AA meetings there.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.606
I'm sure the schedule's on their website.
Let me check.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.611
Yeah, here it is.
Uh, "Family Cancer Support Group."

16:27.695 --> 16:30.489
Family? No, he goes to the one
just for the patient.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.658
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

16:33.909 --> 16:38.038
"For cancer patients, their family,
and caregivers."

16:38.122 --> 16:38.956
Yeah.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.874
Yeah, it's the only one.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.836
Why didn't he want me there?

16:45.129 --> 16:48.590
Well, if it makes you feel better,
you can come to one of my AA meetings

16:48.674 --> 16:49.717
and support me.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.427
I can't that day. Sorry.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.845
You want half to go?

16:53.637 --> 16:54.805
Thanks.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.644
Hey.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
Where's, uh, Brianna?

17:04.356 --> 17:07.693
She said she'd rather eat
in a bathroom stall than with me.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.945
[slight chuckle]

17:11.613 --> 17:14.700
So, how are you... how you holding up?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.953
Well, actually, it's been just--

17:18.037 --> 17:20.330
I feel you. I feel you. It's like, ugh!

17:20.414 --> 17:22.041
-Mm-hmm.
-I hate seeing you two fight.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.667
-Right.
-You know, it's...

17:24.084 --> 17:25.085
Look...

17:26.128 --> 17:27.254
I never had siblings.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.632
You know, I-I-I had bird brothers,

17:30.716 --> 17:33.552
which, uh, you know,
they'd fight occasionally,

17:33.635 --> 17:37.097
and they're pretty quick
to make up though.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.265
Okay.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.434
But that's how they do in bird society.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.102
Barry, I don't give a fuck
about your short rib.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.272
This is-- This is bigger
than the short rib, Mallory.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.566
All I did was apply for a job.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.443
And all you have to do
is apologize for it.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.111
I need to apologize?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.154
-Yeah!
-Hmm.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.239
I mean, if you--
if you feel like you should.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.450
Whenever Brianna and I fight,

17:56.533 --> 17:59.870
it only ends if I say I'm sorry
for something I didn't do.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.039
That's what being in a relationship
with Brianna is.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.999
Doesn't that sound crazy to you?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.335
Oh, my God, Brianna is crazy!
[slight chuckle]

18:07.211 --> 18:08.587
What? Are you okay?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.131
-This--
-Wait a min--

18:12.508 --> 18:13.675
Hey.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.554
Too crazy to cancel that short rib?

18:19.765 --> 18:25.729
Ta-da! All right, I'm ready for whatever
and wherever this date is.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.608
I have my formal muumuu, a funky duster,

18:29.691 --> 18:32.778
and cut-off shorts I've restored to pants.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.030
Are you sure about this?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.741
You're right. I'll turn them
back into shorts.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.203
No. What if Jack's secret
is something bad?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.955
Oh. [scoffs]

18:43.038 --> 18:46.250
How bad could it be?
He told me on our first date.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.168
What if he's a flat-earther?

18:48.627 --> 18:50.379
What if he's a dog kicker?

18:50.462 --> 18:54.091
No, I asked him point-blank
if he kicked dogs.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.635
What if he doesn't believe in aliens?

18:56.718 --> 18:58.137
Oh, you shut your mouth.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.639
Doesn't it seem like a lot of work
just to hide the fact

19:00.722 --> 19:03.100
that sometimes you have trouble hearing?

19:03.183 --> 19:07.104
I don't know. Aren't we all
just hiding our toilets, Grace?

19:07.187 --> 19:10.274
That is one
of your more troubling metaphors.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.776
Six crack.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.236
[sighs]

19:16.697 --> 19:17.948
[Sol] Nine dot.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.617
Uh, five crack.

19:25.789 --> 19:26.748
Oh, God.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.713
Okay, my husband's here,

19:32.796 --> 19:36.175
and he thinks
I'm at the cancer support group next door.

19:36.258 --> 19:40.220
So you both have cancer right now,
so just go with it.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.723
I had cancer once. Skin.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.017
Great. Follow Greg's lead.

19:45.100 --> 19:50.063
Uh, yes, and Greg's skin cancer is, uh...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.524
Uh, I-I don't know, uh--

19:52.608 --> 19:56.320
This isn't your improv class, Ron.
Just be cool.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.696
-[clears throat]
-[Robert] Sol.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.908
-What's going on?
-Oh. Hey, Robert.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.409
Whatcha doing here?

20:02.868 --> 20:07.539
Well, I was just coming to support you
in your cancer support group.

20:07.623 --> 20:11.501
I saw online that families <i>are</i> allowed.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.962
And welcome.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.505
Mm-hmm.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.673
[inhales]

20:17.716 --> 20:22.471
Greg, what was that thing you were
just saying about your skin cancer?

20:23.263 --> 20:25.098
Uh, no, thank you.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.187
Uh, I, uh...

20:31.605 --> 20:32.689
Cancer.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.112
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, Grace. Nice to see you again.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
-Jack's here.
-Hey!

20:41.531 --> 20:43.784
I hope this is all right
to wear on our date.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.077
Of course it is.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.747
You could wear your pants as a jacket
as far as I'm concerned.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.999
-Oh, really?
-[Jack chuckles]

20:51.583 --> 20:54.336
I'm just so happy you agreed
to a second date with me.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.797
Why wouldn't I go
on another date with you?

20:57.756 --> 21:02.636
[exhales] I guess because the only
other time I told someone what I told you,

21:02.719 --> 21:04.888
she freaked out and ghosted me.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.056
Hmm.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.809
Look, Jack... [clears throat]

21:09.351 --> 21:13.188
I-I need to be honest about that thing
you told me the other night.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.107
Oh, man, now you're freaking out.

21:15.190 --> 21:21.113
No, no, no. Uh, the reason
I reacted so well was, um...

21:21.571 --> 21:24.741
was Grace told me the exact same thing

21:24.825 --> 21:26.034
-about her.
-[coughs]

21:26.118 --> 21:28.870
-[gasps] Oh.
-So I was used to it.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.748
And-- And since you two
have that in common,

21:32.374 --> 21:35.419
why don't I give you some space
to talk about it.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.629
Uh, anybody want some pop?
[makes pop sound]

21:37.713 --> 21:38.714
[chuckles]

21:39.381 --> 21:40.966
Oh, Grace, wow.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.385
Yeah. Wow, indeed.

21:44.094 --> 21:47.556
-Yeah, just a second, Jack.
-You-- Yeah. Wow.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.683
Absolutely not!

21:49.766 --> 21:51.226
There's a special place in hell

21:51.310 --> 21:53.228
-for women who don't help other women.
-[scoffs]

21:53.312 --> 21:57.357
I am not gonna pretend that I have
the same deep, dark secrets that Jack has.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.442
Why not?

21:58.525 --> 22:01.153
I don't even know what they are,
and neither do you,

22:01.236 --> 22:03.155
'cause you're too ashamed
to admit you can't hear.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.908
Oh, just like you're too ashamed
to tell everyone we're selling a toilet.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.618
I'm generating intrigue.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.287
That's what I'm doing.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.582
Mine's working. Yours is a disaster.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.625
Look at this, working.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.546
"I rose up for equal pay at work.
Hashtag rise up."

22:20.380 --> 22:24.885
"I rose up for access ramps
at my grocery store. Hashtag rise up."

22:24.968 --> 22:28.805
"I rose up for less Jews
at my country club! Hashtag..."

22:29.431 --> 22:30.640
Oh, my God.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.976
I'm sure that must be one crackpot.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.521
And 70 of the crackpot's friends.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.107
Turn off the Internet!
Turn off the Internet!

22:40.650 --> 22:46.156
What if Jack's secret is that he doesn't
want Jews in his country club?

23:03.757 --> 23:06.885
You happy? Now I'm not talking
to my boyfriend either.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.391
[sighs]

23:12.474 --> 23:13.517
Fuck that.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.145
How is it that no matter what you do
to someone, it's never your fault?

23:17.229 --> 23:20.607
I know. I've struggled
with this irony, too.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.484
[Mallory] Then struggle with this:

23:22.567 --> 23:27.489
I was seeing if I could actually get a job
that wasn't given to me by my sister.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.909
I wanted to know
that I was worth something...

23:31.576 --> 23:33.620
to someone on my own merits.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.625
Didn't you feel that exact same way
with Mom?

23:38.708 --> 23:39.668
[groans]

23:40.001 --> 23:41.086
Yes.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.423
Okay, I get it. Sort of.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.382
But...

23:46.466 --> 23:49.094
I thought we were
kind of in this together now, Mal.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.054
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

23:51.138 --> 23:52.597
[exhales] Oh, Jesus.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.268
Why can't the people in my life
just know how hard it is for me

23:56.351 --> 23:59.479
to say nice things
and stop fucking bothering me about it?

24:00.730 --> 24:02.858
Do you see how hard
everything is for me, Mal?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.735
Yeah, no, it's so tough. It's so, ugh!

24:05.819 --> 24:10.157
Well, none of it matters now
because I'm sure you got the job. But...

24:12.117 --> 24:13.452
you should stay.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.287
I want you to stay.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.498
Thank you.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.423
I am staying.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.968
But you should know
that I didn't get the job.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.303
-What?
-Yeah.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.388
Well, you have to give me names,

24:33.472 --> 24:35.182
'cause I'm gonna be
making some phone calls

24:35.265 --> 24:38.018
and telling them
that they are fucking idiots

24:38.101 --> 24:40.979
and thank them for being fucking idiots.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.316
Thank you.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.907
And I will go with you
to short rib on Friday.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.533
Great.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.410
But don't tell Barry yet.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.497
He's much more generous in bed
when he's depressed.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.542
[dog barks]

25:05.587 --> 25:06.838
[door opens]

25:11.551 --> 25:14.387
Before you say anything, I'm not mad.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.849
I know you're under a lot of stress,
so I forgive you.

25:17.933 --> 25:18.767
[Sol] No!

25:19.768 --> 25:21.311
I reject your forgiveness.

25:21.394 --> 25:24.147
What? No, you can't do that.

25:24.231 --> 25:28.902
I just did. Because I lied to you,
and you should be mad.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.487
Well, I'm sorry.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.114
I just don't think it's healthy
for me to be mad at you right now.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.117
That! That right there.
That's what I don't want.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.536
Well, what do you want?

25:37.619 --> 25:40.372
To be treated like a normal guy
for five minutes.

25:40.455 --> 25:44.584
But instead, you and everyone else
keep rubbing cancer in my face.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.963
-That's not true.
-Oh, yeah? Well, I know for a fact

25:48.046 --> 25:51.591
Coyote snuck my credit card
back into my wallet this week.

25:51.675 --> 25:55.845
And if that isn't rubbing cancer
in my face, I don't know what is.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.808
I'm sorry, Sol.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.226
I just...

26:01.935 --> 26:04.980
wanted one place I could go

26:05.063 --> 26:07.107
and not have to think about it.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.276
Well, you should've led with that!

26:09.359 --> 26:10.902
-[exhales]
-Not dealing with things

26:10.986 --> 26:13.405
is my preferred way
of dealing with things.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.074
Grace hated that about me.
You hate it about me.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.618
I see the value in it now.

26:18.952 --> 26:24.124
Well, I'm... just trying to figure out
what I'm supposed to do here.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.084
-I'm a little lost.
-Me, too.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.381
Can we be lost together?

26:31.464 --> 26:32.465
Yes.

26:35.302 --> 26:38.096
And I'll try to be better
about telling you what I need.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.723
Okay.

26:41.099 --> 26:46.021
Robert, would you care to attend
my cancer denial group?

26:46.396 --> 26:48.940
What exactly would that entail?

26:49.024 --> 26:51.234
-We eat crappy food...
-Mm-hmm.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.194
...and we don't talk about feelings.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.238
I feel so seen.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.781
[laughs]

26:59.034 --> 27:00.368
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.203
Can we talk out here for a minute?

27:02.287 --> 27:04.789
Uh, yeah, but if we don't leave soon,
we'll miss our reservation.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.793
I'm not sure you're gonna want to go
after I tell you what I have to tell you.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.754
Oh, well, I'm listening.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.716
I hope I take it as well as you did.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.428
You know how there are those people,
who, when they get older,

27:18.511 --> 27:22.349
they end up needing hearing aids
because it gets harder to hear?

27:22.432 --> 27:24.768
Especially in cool new restaurants?

27:24.851 --> 27:26.895
Yeah, I've heard legend of, yes.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.065
Well, them peeps be me.

27:30.482 --> 27:34.361
I've needed hearing aids for years,
but I was too embarrassed to get them.

27:34.444 --> 27:38.448
Frankie, I-I don't mean to belittle
your experience, but...

27:39.532 --> 27:42.369
why would I not want to go
to dinner with you after that?

27:42.452 --> 27:45.622
Because if I hadn't been
too embarrassed to get them,

27:45.705 --> 27:49.376
I... I would have been able to hear
what you told me the other night.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.128
But I didn't. So I couldn't.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.382
And now I have no idea
what you've tried to tell me.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.758
You're serious?

27:56.841 --> 27:59.594
-You didn't hear me? At all?
-No, not a word.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.555
-[exhales]
-But on the upside, I can hear you now.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.684
And I want to hear
whatever you have to say.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.770
Okay, here it goes.

28:09.896 --> 28:14.109
Years ago, I told everyone
I went to rehab for drinking.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.194
Oh, that's no problem.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.905
I lived with my son for years in rehab.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.573
I wasn't supposed to,

28:20.657 --> 28:22.117
-but I hid really well.
-Hmm.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.494
But that wasn't the truth.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.912
Oh.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.664
Twist.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.084
Oh, twist.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.128
The truth is, I didn't go to rehab.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.131
That's what I told people
because it sounded a lot cooler

28:36.214 --> 28:37.549
than where I really went.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.509
Where did you really go?

28:39.968 --> 28:42.929
I was asked rather insistently

28:43.012 --> 28:46.015
not to be a part of society
for a little bit.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.977
Well, that's... that's not a big deal.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.939
I did my nickel.
Five hours at Disneyland jail.

28:53.773 --> 28:57.819
No. I spent several months
in a psych hospital.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.698
I had a miserable divorce
that went on forever,

29:02.115 --> 29:04.367
and I did not react well.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.747
I may have mailed my wife's rabbit
to the president.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.666
And they blew him up pretty quick.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.753
Wow, that is heavy.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.171
Yeah.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.967
I guess not everybody can deal with it.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.052
I'm not everybody.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.847
No, you're not.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.016
[chuckles]

29:34.105 --> 29:37.025
Oh, the website is updated.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.695
Should be no more confusion now.
It's clearly a toilet.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.781
We've disavowed all the hate groups

29:42.864 --> 29:46.951
that co-opted
the Hashtag Rise Up campaign.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.955
We sent that anti-Semite
the complete works of Elie Wiesel

29:51.039 --> 29:52.040
and <i>Seinfeld.</i>

29:55.043 --> 29:56.503
That's the end of the list.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.338
Now what?

29:59.339 --> 30:00.715
Now everybody hates us.

30:01.007 --> 30:05.804
On the bright side, it seems that,
in this time of extreme polarization,

30:06.095 --> 30:11.100
we've brought all these disparate groups
together in hate against a common enemy.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.936
Yeah, our toilet.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.103
-Hmm.
-[Grace exhales]

30:15.563 --> 30:17.357
-[cell phone chirps]
-Oh.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.567
This could be a positive tweet.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.071
"Your toilet sucks."

30:24.030 --> 30:25.281
Oh, darlings.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.742
We're sunk.
