01:38.210 --> 01:40.388
What's your level of
Laziness right now?

01:41.327 --> 01:41.960
Hmm...

01:43.225 --> 01:44.341
Six.

01:44.695 --> 01:46.182
- What about you?
- Eight...

01:46.433 --> 01:47.753
And a half

01:47.788 --> 01:48.812
And a half?!
That much!?

01:49.780 --> 01:52.593
Ah... This sun, these
holidays, this pool...

01:52.882 --> 01:55.132
It makes me feel lazy to
think that this will all end

01:55.264 --> 01:57.296
Ah, I'm lazy because
of doing nothing...

01:57.906 --> 01:59.359
I'm very happy doing nothing...

01:59.469 --> 02:02.438
No... We never do anything on holidays.
Nothing happens.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.375
And what do you want to happen?

02:05.383 --> 02:06.320
I don't know...

02:06.702 --> 02:09.389
But the great dramas,
the great romances

02:09.804 --> 02:12.452
On our holidays,
they never happen...

02:12.898 --> 02:15.234
And with whom do you imagine
your "Great romance"?

02:15.465 --> 02:17.277
You're the one always saying that
our classroom is full of frogs.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.989
Well, it doesn't
have to be a prince.

02:24.715 --> 02:26.989
And you. Don't you
care about that?

02:27.036 --> 02:28.098
With what?

02:28.153 --> 02:30.239
What? Are you going to go through your
whole life without kissing anyone?

02:30.271 --> 02:31.732
Giovanna!

02:31.786 --> 02:33.216
Well, it's the truth.
Sleeping and

02:33.271 --> 02:35.763
listening to Beethoven during the
Holidays you won't solve that...

02:35.904 --> 02:38.825
You should kiss any girl, just
to get it out of the way.

02:39.136 --> 02:41.730
If I should just kiss any girl,
then why don't I kiss you, then?

02:43.987 --> 02:46.527
But I don't want my first
kiss to be like that

02:46.605 --> 02:48.699
Ugh, Leo. You're never
going to kiss anybody.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.598
Who would want to kiss me?

02:50.739 --> 02:53.161
I bet that that Witch,
Karina, would...

02:56.639 --> 02:58.983
But it's very likely that
you'll become a frog.

02:59.084 --> 03:00.225
Dummy.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.545
That one is always watching you.

03:04.529 --> 03:06.068
But it's depressing to know
that the only person that

03:06.233 --> 03:08.647
would hook up with
me, is Karina.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.724
And she only talks
shit, you know?

03:13.036 --> 03:14.193
So boring...

03:14.279 --> 03:16.458
What if we hooked up
and she glues to me?

03:16.716 --> 03:18.325
Do you think she's that type?

03:18.989 --> 03:22.013
Gi?

03:22.091 --> 03:23.295
Giovanna...

03:23.349 --> 03:24.154
Hey.

03:24.193 --> 03:25.334
Did you say something?

03:25.584 --> 03:26.990
Weren't you listening to me?

03:27.045 --> 03:28.295
No...

03:28.756 --> 03:31.295
Get in the water, Leonardo.
Stop being so boring.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.240
Nobody says I'm boring!

03:37.416 --> 03:39.369
Are you sure you don't
want to come in, gi?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.205
Nah, I still have to get
my school things ready.

03:42.361 --> 03:43.627
Give me your keys, Leo.

03:53.721 --> 03:54.557
Here.

03:56.916 --> 03:58.393
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.341
Mom?

04:12.558 --> 04:13.487
I'm home.

04:13.558 --> 04:14.417
Hi, Leo.

04:14.442 --> 04:15.901
Lunch is ready.

04:16.136 --> 04:17.072
I'll be right there.

04:43.793 --> 04:45.144
Hey, Leo.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.441
How was your day?

04:46.684 --> 04:48.457
-Okay.
-Just Okay?

04:49.199 --> 04:49.879
Nah.

04:50.035 --> 04:50.910
It was cool.

04:50.935 --> 04:53.199
You look really burned.
Did you use sunscreen?

04:53.584 --> 04:54.505
Yes, I did, mom.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.603
It was just really sunny.

04:56.376 --> 04:57.376
Are you sure?

04:57.908 --> 05:00.150
Aw, mom... You know I
don't like sunscreen.

05:00.712 --> 05:03.080
It get's all sticky
on your skin...

05:03.183 --> 05:04.761
Seriously. I prefer
to not sunbathe.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.066
Good. Cause that's what's going
to happen the next time.

05:07.128 --> 05:08.089
Relax, mom...

05:08.114 --> 05:09.058
Yeah, relax...

05:09.175 --> 05:10.456
Did you get your things ready?

05:11.045 --> 05:13.287
No. I was waiting for the
laziness to go away.

05:13.873 --> 05:15.865
But now I'm gonna have
to do it feeling lazy.

05:17.310 --> 05:19.990
-Hey Little lion.
-Hey, Dad.

05:22.913 --> 05:24.756
You are burned. Where were you?

05:25.061 --> 05:26.124
At Gi's.

05:27.311 --> 05:29.429
You know? The other day I
met Gi and I was startled.

05:29.679 --> 05:30.694
Why?

05:30.736 --> 05:33.321
Gi's all grown up all.
Became a woman.

05:33.626 --> 05:35.048
What do you mean, dad?

05:35.181 --> 05:37.798
Just the other day the two
of you were just kids...

05:37.823 --> 05:40.196
And now you're getting old.
Becoming decent people.

05:41.484 --> 05:42.453
Chair, Leo.

05:43.047 --> 05:44.320
Dad, seriously...

05:44.345 --> 05:45.710
I must have super powers.

05:45.735 --> 05:47.500
I've been doing this for
so long and I never fell.

05:47.525 --> 05:48.797
You're so funny...

05:50.617 --> 05:52.156
Leo, I talked to your Grandma

05:52.734 --> 05:55.445
And on this wednesday she has a
doctor's appointment so I thought...

05:55.470 --> 05:56.172
That's okay. I can come here.

05:56.453 --> 05:57.891
And you're gonna be here alone?

05:57.916 --> 05:58.922
Why? Can't I?

05:58.993 --> 06:00.399
Leo, What are you going to eat?

06:00.424 --> 06:03.415
I don't know. I eat at school,
make a sandwich. I don't know...

06:04.829 --> 06:06.563
No. I'd be worried.

06:06.588 --> 06:07.235
Mom...

06:07.592 --> 06:09.397
What's so tragic
that can happen?

06:12.569 --> 06:14.217
Okay, then...

06:14.771 --> 06:18.022
-But, Leo. Call us as soon
as you get home -Okay

06:18.280 --> 06:20.170
And make sure your
phone is charged.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.527
Okay, mom.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.190
Up.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.111
Can I know what's the joke, Mr.
Guilherme?

06:57.479 --> 06:59.151
Nothing, teacher.

06:59.183 --> 07:02.800
I'm sorry guys, but that duo is not
going to work for another year.

07:03.191 --> 07:05.597
Fabio, please, sit behind Leo.

07:05.622 --> 07:07.910
-Aw, No, prof.
-Aw, yes, Fabio.

07:07.935 --> 07:10.159
You know we can't
sit behind Leo.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.878
That close to this infernal
"tec-tec" all day long...

07:12.903 --> 07:14.354
You're a real asshole
aren't you,you idiot?

07:14.379 --> 07:15.776
Take care of your
things, human-cane.

07:15.801 --> 07:17.292
Fabio, you're such a dick.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.442
I'll show you what's a dick
later...Seeing eye-dog.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.442
Shut up, you idiot!

07:21.467 --> 07:22.606
What is this, people?!

07:22.631 --> 07:24.106
Where do you think you are?

07:24.131 --> 07:24.817
Prof...

07:24.842 --> 07:29.004
If I sit on that chair behind Leo, I'm
going to have to help him all day.

07:29.388 --> 07:31.191
Shit, he can't do
anything on his own.

07:31.216 --> 07:31.777
That's enough, Fábio.

07:31.802 --> 07:35.098
You won't have to help anyone at the
principal's office. Get your things.

07:36.087 --> 07:38.141
Wow prof... That's low.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.087
What about Giovanna? Is she not
going to the Principal's office?

07:41.212 --> 07:43.110
What about you? Wanna be
his 'plus one' there?

07:43.602 --> 07:44.688
No, Thanks.

07:44.713 --> 07:45.687
Fábio...

07:49.593 --> 07:51.148
Is this the 211?

07:51.173 --> 07:52.218
Yes, it's here.

07:52.749 --> 07:53.820
What's your name?

07:54.131 --> 07:55.272
Gabriel.

07:55.297 --> 07:56.295
You can come in.

08:03.451 --> 08:04.983
Can I sit on that empty chair?

08:06.678 --> 08:07.420
People...

08:09.475 --> 08:11.186
Yes, you can go.

08:12.415 --> 08:14.431
Welcome, Gabriel.

08:23.506 --> 08:25.396
Any more funny jokes?

08:26.740 --> 08:27.154
Huh?

08:27.599 --> 08:28.928
NOPE.

08:34.668 --> 08:35.386
The keys, Leo.

08:53.198 --> 08:54.299
Bye, Gi.

08:54.338 --> 08:55.354
Bye.

08:55.379 --> 08:57.831
Don't let that idiot,
Fábio, Ruin your day, okay?

08:57.963 --> 08:58.940
Okay.

09:43.178 --> 09:46.639
I'm gonna tell you something.
The new kid is very cute.

09:46.781 --> 09:49.203
Who knows? Maybe this
year things get better.

09:49.437 --> 09:50.679
Looks like it.

09:50.704 --> 09:53.110
Maybe he's my enchanted prince.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.695
Don't overdo it, Giovanna.

09:54.805 --> 09:57.227
He's just in. You
barely know him.

09:57.693 --> 09:59.232
Are you jealous, Leo?

09:59.334 --> 10:02.013
Yes, Giovanna. I'm
dying of jealousy.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.810
Unbelievable. What the hell...

10:06.835 --> 10:09.137
-What?
-Karina is always hitting on everyone

10:09.200 --> 10:10.442
What are you talking about, Gi?

10:10.467 --> 10:13.262
She just sat next to Gabriel
and is already hitting on him.

10:13.287 --> 10:17.176
It's not enough to hit on you. A new guy
comes and she's already going for it.

10:23.607 --> 10:27.232
Okay. Cells can be split
in two basic types...

10:30.204 --> 10:32.251
Can I borrow an eraser?

10:32.789 --> 10:35.219
I don't use erasers...

10:36.266 --> 10:37.704
-Sorry...
-Nah, It's cool.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.019
Ah, Hang on...

10:48.927 --> 10:50.005
Thanks.

10:50.030 --> 10:50.646
You're welcome.

10:56.807 --> 10:58.495
If I were pluto and
someone told me...

10:58.520 --> 11:00.503
"Hey, You're not a
planet anymore!"

11:00.528 --> 11:03.339
I'd be really mad. Seriously.

11:03.450 --> 11:04.614
Keys, Leo.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.481
Bye.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.497
Bye, Leo.

11:19.522 --> 11:20.606
Bye, Gabriel.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.061
Well... Bye to you too, then.

11:31.086 --> 11:32.272
You don't keep going down?

11:32.514 --> 11:36.568
No, I live two block back. I just
always bring Leo to his place.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.741
Well. See you tomorrow, then.

11:45.267 --> 11:47.790
Yes mom. Safe and
sound in my room.

11:49.188 --> 11:52.071
Okay mom. I will have lunch,

13:13.903 --> 13:15.583
Have you ever though about
studying abroad, Gi?

13:15.608 --> 13:17.036
What do you mean?

13:17.661 --> 13:18.567
Exchange...

13:19.871 --> 13:20.778
Live outside...

13:20.996 --> 13:22.856
Not me. Laziness...

13:23.692 --> 13:24.207
Why?

13:25.581 --> 13:26.722
I was thinking about that.

13:27.017 --> 13:27.993
I don't know...

13:28.142 --> 13:29.384
Move to the USA.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.072
Ah, not the US, Leo.

13:31.097 --> 13:34.204
France is really cool. Can you imagine?
Vacationing in Paris.

13:34.229 --> 13:36.251
But I'm not talking
about vacations...

13:36.907 --> 13:41.579
And... US, France... Wherever...
it's fine...

13:42.766 --> 13:44.180
I just want to leave...

13:45.873 --> 13:47.756
But why that now, Leo?

13:48.708 --> 13:50.598
It's not the first time
I think about that.

13:50.856 --> 13:51.723
It's been awhile.

13:52.669 --> 13:55.903
Just imagine how cool it would be to
go somewhere and no one knows you

13:56.622 --> 13:58.497
No one knows who you are

13:59.231 --> 14:01.458
You can invent a new
personality if you want to.

14:01.810 --> 14:03.864
What? You don't like
your personality?

14:03.889 --> 14:04.935
I do.

14:05.497 --> 14:07.435
But I am not a problem.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.345
Excuse me

14:12.431 --> 14:13.993
Are you going to stay for dinner

14:14.018 --> 14:14.954
Yes I will

14:14.979 --> 14:17.579
-When it's ready I'll call
you guys -Okay, Thanks.

14:21.670 --> 14:22.491
What about your mom

14:22.959 --> 14:24.116
What about her?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.295
What does she think about that?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.944
Obviously, she doesn't know.

14:27.969 --> 14:31.709
And you intended to move to another
country with telling your parents, Leo?

14:31.814 --> 14:32.900
Who knows?

14:35.486 --> 14:37.252
You're crazy, Leo.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.109
Where's yours?

14:44.234 --> 14:45.742
At home.

14:45.767 --> 14:46.929
At home?

14:46.954 --> 14:47.664
Let's go?

14:47.689 --> 14:48.414
Let's go.

14:48.439 --> 14:50.976
I'm not going with you today. I'm
having lunch at my grandma's.

14:51.187 --> 14:52.492
Ah, today's wednesday!

14:52.841 --> 14:54.638
I'm sorry, I'm taking Leo
to his Grandma's house.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.544
No, Gi. You don't have to.

14:56.569 --> 14:57.490
I can go alone.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.294
It's right there,
I can take you.

14:59.319 --> 15:01.060
Yeah, It's right there.
I can go alone.

15:01.113 --> 15:02.371
Are you sure, Leo?

15:02.396 --> 15:03.692
Yes.

15:03.717 --> 15:05.426
Okay, Your choice.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.324
Well, guys. We'll
talk later, okay?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.504
Okay.

15:14.379 --> 15:15.574
-Call me, Okay?
-Okay.

15:18.494 --> 15:19.393
Hey, mom.

15:20.705 --> 15:22.143
Yes, I'm here at school.

15:23.283 --> 15:25.096
Yes, I'm going to grandma's.
As soon as I get there I...

15:26.029 --> 15:27.341
I will, mom...

15:27.903 --> 15:28.997
Kisses.

16:16.091 --> 16:17.864
Leo. Are you okay?

16:17.889 --> 16:18.896
Leave...

16:21.716 --> 16:23.084
Leo, are you okay?

16:23.109 --> 16:23.927
Yes.

16:23.952 --> 16:25.193
-Are you sure? I can take you to the nurse...
-I'm fine, Karina.

16:27.645 --> 16:29.669
You guys are fucks, huh?

16:55.970 --> 16:56.767
Hello?

16:57.416 --> 16:58.697
Hey, mom.

16:59.438 --> 17:00.766
No, non. Nothing yet.

17:01.578 --> 17:03.313
You sure he didn't say
where he was going to?

17:05.297 --> 17:06.961
Giovanna doesn't know either.

17:08.718 --> 17:11.944
It's better that you stay there. He could
go to your house and not find anyone.

17:14.015 --> 17:15.819
I think It's better that way.

17:17.592 --> 17:19.435
I'll hang up now.
Maybe he calls...

17:25.150 --> 17:26.321
She doesn't know anything...

17:31.728 --> 17:32.853
Leonardo!

17:32.900 --> 17:34.330
Wow, mom... what?

17:34.355 --> 17:35.689
Where were you, Leo?

17:35.714 --> 17:37.165
-Around...
-Around?!

17:37.190 --> 17:41.181
You didn't think about calling your mom
telling her you wouldn't come home?

17:41.206 --> 17:43.603
-Mom, chill..
-Leo, do you know what time it is?

17:44.260 --> 17:46.026
You, out there, at
night, in the dark...

17:47.167 --> 17:49.878
It's always dark for me, okay?
No need for all this neurosis.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.987
-Why didn't you pick up your phone?
-Mom, I'm sorry.

17:53.012 --> 17:54.320
Okay? It was in the backpack.

17:55.195 --> 17:58.281
I think I'm old enough to not have
to tell you about everything I do.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.406
Leonardo, you're still gonna have
to tell us a lot of things..

18:01.810 --> 18:03.592
Shit, dad. You too?

18:03.966 --> 18:07.246
-Can't I take one step without you watching me?
-Oh, watching you?

18:07.271 --> 18:09.475
You disappear for one hour
and we should be calm?

18:09.500 --> 18:13.742
Mom, ask anyone from my class if their parents
would be so mad over a little thing like this.

18:14.216 --> 18:16.771
-Leo, You know it's different.
-Why does it have to be different, mom?!

18:17.708 --> 18:19.560
Why don't you try to
make it the same?!

18:23.738 --> 18:27.066
-Leonardo, your grandma said you got hurt...
-It was nothing, mom.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.152
It was just a scratch.
Can I take a shower?

18:30.793 --> 18:32.246
You want to give
me a shower now?

18:33.027 --> 18:35.598
-Leo
-Let him go, Laura...

18:45.384 --> 18:47.751
Hi kids. How can I help?

18:47.984 --> 18:50.969
So... I wanted to study abroad.

18:51.484 --> 18:54.461
So I wanted some information.

18:54.486 --> 18:59.452
So, I need your parents to come here.
And then we have a chat

18:59.937 --> 19:02.749
And then we explain
how everything works.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.703
-Okay. Thanks
-You're welcome.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.844
But Ma'am... just so that we
don't waste our time here.

19:07.869 --> 19:10.687
Can't you just give us an
idea of what you need?

19:10.810 --> 19:12.857
Okay. You want to
study abroad as well?

19:13.357 --> 19:14.294
Could be...

19:14.450 --> 19:15.263
Okay.

19:15.288 --> 19:21.035
I'm going to go get some pamphlets.So you guys
can do some research, and so can your parents.

19:21.387 --> 19:22.582
Just a minute.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.142
Here it is

19:34.439 --> 19:36.259
-Thanks
-You're welcome.

19:36.946 --> 19:40.939
So, we'll be back later with our
parents, okay? -Okay, that's great.

19:40.964 --> 19:42.211
Just one more question...

19:42.617 --> 19:47.172
Do you think it would be a problem for
me to study abroad? Being blind...

19:48.300 --> 19:53.128
Look. I'll be honest. I never a blind
person that wanted to do an exchange.

19:53.815 --> 19:58.011
But I think it's all a matter of finding
a family that's ready to receive you.

19:58.703 --> 19:59.851
Let's do this...

20:00.008 --> 20:01.749
Give me your phone number...

20:01.900 --> 20:04.314
I'll do some research
and I'll call you.

20:04.572 --> 20:06.486
-Okay.
-Okay? What's your number?

20:06.907 --> 20:11.249
It's 9483709

20:13.608 --> 20:16.491
Well... That's it guys.

20:16.568 --> 20:19.099
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome

20:25.246 --> 20:27.652
Anything else? Dessert?

20:27.924 --> 20:30.150
-Want some coffee?
-No. Thanks ma.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.724
Ma?

20:35.245 --> 20:37.245
How old was my mom
when I was born?

20:38.183 --> 20:40.511
22... no... 23

20:41.066 --> 20:42.340
Got married soon...

20:42.746 --> 20:44.652
And you were born soon after.

20:48.069 --> 20:51.663
-Did she date anyone before my dad?
-No, he was her first boyfriend.

20:53.108 --> 20:55.585
She did so many
things with your dad.

20:55.731 --> 20:58.254
Your grandpa would
get crazy with her.

20:59.395 --> 21:02.356
-But she only left her house after she got married...
-Oh, yeah.

21:03.489 --> 21:04.356
Why?

21:05.289 --> 21:06.687
Was thinking about
that the other day...

21:07.711 --> 21:10.289
-Thinking about having kids?
-No...

21:12.334 --> 21:14.108
I want to leave my house...

21:15.923 --> 21:18.196
How would you sustain yourself?

21:18.454 --> 21:20.071
I'll get a job...

21:20.165 --> 21:21.352
Everybody works.

21:22.266 --> 21:25.243
There's a dude at school that is a
waiter at his dad's restaurant.

21:25.802 --> 21:27.818
Isn't it a little
early for that, Leo?

21:35.758 --> 21:37.484
Okay... kisses.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.429
Who was it? Girlfriend?

21:45.586 --> 21:46.516
My dad...

21:47.172 --> 21:49.938
-Your parents are worried? Like Leo's?
-Hey...

21:51.375 --> 21:54.672
It's actually just my dad. My
mom died when I was a child.

21:56.195 --> 21:57.445
Is it just the two of you?

21:57.922 --> 21:59.133
I have an older brother.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.096
He lives with you two?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.198
No. He stayed in
the city I lived.

22:04.026 --> 22:04.995
But you two are okay?

22:05.385 --> 22:08.065
-Kind of...
-Why 'Kind of'?

22:08.790 --> 22:10.469
We're very different, you know?

22:10.891 --> 22:15.227
He's an engineer, only thinks in numbers.
I love reading, he hates it.

22:15.673 --> 22:17.532
At least for music,
we're the same.

22:18.349 --> 22:20.654
Did you know Leo only
listens to classical?

22:21.583 --> 22:22.904
Really?

22:24.161 --> 22:24.982
Yeah.

22:25.755 --> 22:29.169
I always wanted to learn classical
music, but I never had the patience.

22:29.544 --> 22:32.434
How come? It's the best
type of music there is.

22:32.639 --> 22:35.397
-Don't exaggerate -But guys,
it really is, isn't it?

22:35.631 --> 22:37.819
Why do you like it so much?

22:38.247 --> 22:39.692
Because of my Grandma Maria.

22:40.331 --> 22:42.252
Since I was a child
she would tell me.

22:42.277 --> 22:46.675
To understand anything, you
must begin with the classic.

22:46.814 --> 22:49.743
The problem is Leo started with the
classical and got stuck there.

22:50.673 --> 22:51.642
Dummy...

22:51.907 --> 22:54.954
-You can give me some lessons later, then.
-Okay.

22:55.651 --> 22:58.917
That's all I needed. Beethoven
and Mozart Together.

23:01.503 --> 23:04.542
-Guys, it's getting quite late.
I have to go -Already?

23:04.567 --> 23:05.972
Yeah, I have to go as well.

23:05.997 --> 23:09.456
Okay... so wait for me to go
and change to take you, Leo.

23:09.481 --> 23:12.413
If you want to, I can take Leo. Then
you don't have to go and come back.

23:12.438 --> 23:13.874
No, it's right over there.

23:13.899 --> 23:16.452
My house is on Gabriel's way anyway.
Makes thing easier.

23:16.789 --> 23:18.250
Much easier.

23:18.601 --> 23:19.765
Your choice.

23:20.101 --> 23:21.250
Well, Let's go.

23:24.747 --> 23:26.864
It's about an hour and
a half from São Paulo

23:26.889 --> 23:29.653
It's not far, then. An hour and
a half is relatively close.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.239
Sorry...

23:32.280 --> 23:34.397
-I forgot about the step.
-Relax, no problem.

23:35.357 --> 23:38.654
-You warn me about the next one.
-I'm sorry.

23:55.658 --> 24:00.306
Well, people. Since we're talking about
greece I want you to make a project.

24:00.392 --> 24:01.822
It's a project for pairs.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.388
But the pairs have to be
between boys, or girls.

24:05.692 --> 24:09.113
Girls will talk about Athene,
and the boys, Sparta.

24:09.811 --> 24:11.834
Find your pairs, I
want the names.

24:13.928 --> 24:15.420
Can we have a pair of three?

24:18.076 --> 24:19.817
Can I do it with you?
( THAT'S MY FRIEND)

24:19.842 --> 24:20.528
Yeah.

24:26.309 --> 24:27.778
Have you seen that
video of a cat...?

24:27.895 --> 24:30.012
The cat gets inside
the toilet and...

24:31.287 --> 24:32.560
Sorry...

24:33.021 --> 24:34.294
That's fine...

24:38.212 --> 24:41.024
Do people ask you stupid
things like this?

24:41.602 --> 24:43.556
Sometimes...

24:45.626 --> 24:47.243
Have you always been
like this, Leo?

24:48.112 --> 24:48.635
Always...

24:49.510 --> 24:51.002
I was born like this.

24:51.955 --> 24:54.065
So you never saw
Giovanna's face?

24:57.475 --> 24:57.998
No...

24:58.779 --> 24:59.795
Never..

25:16.363 --> 25:16.902
Wow...

25:18.202 --> 25:19.616
I'm too lazy to do
this project...

25:19.780 --> 25:20.905
Tell me about it.

25:21.710 --> 25:23.327
We should go to the
movie theater.

25:23.694 --> 25:24.874
Movie Theater?

25:26.171 --> 25:27.991
I'm sorry, Leo.

25:28.399 --> 25:30.200
I swear I'll get used to it.

25:41.544 --> 25:42.598
What?

25:43.302 --> 25:46.052
The giant robot just
destroyed the church.

25:48.892 --> 25:50.150
What now?

25:50.643 --> 25:52.760
Now he has the bride and the
groom, one on each hand.

25:57.321 --> 25:58.696
What?

25:59.148 --> 26:00.610
He just crushed the Groom.

26:01.141 --> 26:02.555
But is he dead?

26:03.125 --> 26:05.032
I think so...

26:11.502 --> 26:14.877
The bride just threw her
bouquet on his face.

26:32.265 --> 26:34.101
-Bye, Gabriel
-Bye, Leo.

26:44.727 --> 26:47.001
So... are you never
talking to us again?

26:51.118 --> 26:51.602
Leo...

26:52.868 --> 26:53.477
Me?

26:53.759 --> 26:56.196
Leonardo, you know you
should have warned us.

26:57.177 --> 26:58.380
You know you overreacted?

26:58.405 --> 27:01.943
-We were worried, Little Lion
-You guys are always worried.

27:02.786 --> 27:05.677
I bet that if there was a school
camp you wouldn't let me go.

27:05.802 --> 27:07.739
-What do you mean?
-What Camp?

27:09.146 --> 27:15.536
There's going to be a camp, and I've been afraid to
ask you to sign it cause I'm sure you'll complain.

27:15.561 --> 27:17.912
I just have to call the
school to ask about it.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.288
See? Everything here
is a huge drama.

27:20.313 --> 27:24.475
Son, it's a camp. We can't just
let you go without knowing...

27:24.500 --> 27:26.538
Dad, it's not just the camp...
okay?

27:27.256 --> 27:30.459
It's not being able to stay home alone.
Having to tell you about every step I take.

27:30.484 --> 27:33.600
Haven't we agreed that
you can stay home alone?

27:33.625 --> 27:38.055
Still... do you know how embarrassing
it is to be treated like this?

27:39.431 --> 27:42.899
-If you call the school, everyone will know.
-And what do you suggest?

27:44.087 --> 27:45.962
That you authorize
it and that's it.

27:45.987 --> 27:48.634
Sorry, Leo, but it
can't be like that...

27:49.181 --> 27:52.024
So embarrassing. It's
like I'm 5 years old.

27:52.049 --> 27:55.459
I'm sorry, but I'm
calling the school.

27:56.396 --> 27:58.334
If there’s no other way...

28:01.927 --> 28:04.912
So, how was it yesterday?
Did you finish the project?

28:04.937 --> 28:07.037
Did Gabriel say
anything about me?

28:07.077 --> 28:09.739
No. He didn't say anything, Gi.

28:10.315 --> 28:13.206
And we ended up not making the project.
We went to the movies.

28:14.753 --> 28:16.753
What do you mean?

28:16.778 --> 28:19.050
Gabriel wanted to go to
the movies, so we went.

28:22.253 --> 28:25.222
Get up, Leo. My leg
kind of hurts..

28:30.276 --> 28:32.792
I can't believe you went
to the movies without me.

28:32.817 --> 28:35.214
But, Gi, We never
go to the movies.

28:35.239 --> 28:37.167
Why didn't you call me?

28:37.192 --> 28:41.979
Sorry, Gi. I didn't think about it at
the time. We decided to go and we did.

29:11.770 --> 29:13.004
What's that, Gabriel?

29:13.950 --> 29:17.722
Belle & Sebastian... A
band I like.You know them?

29:17.747 --> 29:18.910
No..

29:20.729 --> 29:22.495
My brother likes this song.

29:22.520 --> 29:26.995
When I lived in Itapira I shared a room with him
and he would always plays this CD before bed.

29:27.020 --> 29:29.979
But he never made it to the end.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.198
So I stayed up listening
to it by myself.

29:34.292 --> 29:39.275
look... It's not like a
Tchaikovsky but... it's good.

29:44.586 --> 29:45.633
Hey.

29:45.789 --> 29:47.524
What's it like at
the library, Gi?

29:48.883 --> 29:52.071
Weren't you going to make
the project with Larissa?

29:54.696 --> 29:56.289
We are...

29:58.274 --> 30:00.539
Okay, I'll call.

30:01.055 --> 30:02.914
Kisses. Bye.

30:03.911 --> 30:08.161
If we get tired, we can
go to Gi's place. Swim!

30:09.380 --> 30:12.552
We can also get a 0 on
the project as well!

30:23.868 --> 30:25.118
Weird...

30:27.259 --> 30:28.212
Hello?

30:28.790 --> 30:30.587
Hello, Vivaldi?

30:30.915 --> 30:32.618
Dumbass!

30:32.790 --> 30:34.446
Why did you call me?

30:34.993 --> 30:37.493
I wanted to know what was
my ringtone on your phone.

30:37.946 --> 30:41.431
Okay. You got it wrong, It's
not Vivaldi, It's Bach.

30:43.024 --> 30:44.790
I don't wanna be Bach.

30:46.029 --> 30:47.185
What do you want to be?

30:47.825 --> 30:50.216
Can it be Belle & Sebastian?

30:50.560 --> 30:51.513
Yup.

30:51.538 --> 30:53.763
So you can dance
when I call you.

31:00.341 --> 31:03.122
a lot happier than
Bach, right, Leonardo?

31:07.745 --> 31:09.058
Come Dance, Leo.

31:09.104 --> 31:11.230
Not me. I don't
know how to dance.

31:11.255 --> 31:14.245
What do you mean? Look at
your little fingers dancing.

31:15.058 --> 31:16.698
But *I* don't know how to dance.

31:16.723 --> 31:21.777
Leo, There are good and bad dancers,
but everyone knows how to dance.

31:23.183 --> 31:25.605
Some other day, okay?

31:25.630 --> 31:26.933
Boring.

31:37.184 --> 31:38.778
There we go!

31:41.762 --> 31:45.121
You can.. Dance.

31:48.684 --> 31:50.981
Feel free to move
your feet, too.

31:55.715 --> 31:58.543
I must look ridiculous, Gabriel.

31:58.583 --> 32:02.339
-It's not, you can already go to
a club now -Shut up, Gabriel!

32:04.715 --> 32:08.543
Okay. Your first class.

32:13.898 --> 32:17.351
I can't take it anymore with
this project in this library

32:17.376 --> 32:19.648
-What's the laziness level?
-Level 10!

32:19.673 --> 32:23.742
I think I might have even gone above that.
Level Homicide.

32:24.054 --> 32:25.414
Relax, Gi.

32:25.439 --> 32:27.711
Next project we're
together, okay?

32:27.736 --> 32:32.476
-Let's go?
-Oh no, please don't go, just a little more

32:32.501 --> 32:34.320
Gi, I'm sorry.

32:44.565 --> 32:45.330
Bye, Gi.

32:46.846 --> 32:48.986
Goodbye, Boys!

32:54.948 --> 32:57.010
Impossible, Leo. Seriously.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.182
Gabriel, It's easy. Here...

33:00.823 --> 33:04.729
The train let out a...

33:05.276 --> 33:07.432
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

33:09.104 --> 33:10.276
You're gonna have to trust me...

33:11.776 --> 33:13.135
Give me your hand.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.336
Let out a...

33:17.618 --> 33:21.211
-Strong.. here, this is an..
-It's impossible. I give up.

33:21.236 --> 33:23.493
Gabriel, It's not impossible.

33:23.518 --> 33:25.118
It's gonna take me too long
to learn this, Gabriel.

33:25.143 --> 33:27.477
Impossible is me riding
a bike, Gabriel.

33:27.502 --> 33:29.321
Not this.

33:29.493 --> 33:30.946
Hi, Gabriel.

33:30.971 --> 33:34.384
-Do you guys want a juice, something?
-No, Thanks.

33:34.416 --> 33:39.275
-Thanks mom, we'll be there later -Okay
then.If you need me, I'm in the living room.

33:41.479 --> 33:47.057
You should read Braille with your eyes.
Just like the alphabet... but braille.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.244
Here..

33:53.269 --> 33:56.950
-What's this?
-Braille Alphabet.

34:01.357 --> 34:03.982
Leo, today's the eclipse.
Wanna go see it?

34:05.404 --> 34:08.746
Of course... of course we'll
see the eclipse, Gabriel.

34:10.167 --> 34:11.016
Sorry...

34:11.041 --> 34:13.462
It's just that my dad said that
there's a park right here that

34:13.487 --> 34:15.791
would be perfect to see the eclipse.
I really wanted to go.

34:15.815 --> 34:18.001
Let's go, what time is it?

34:18.025 --> 34:20.485
Really late, like 1:30 AM

34:21.626 --> 34:25.063
Yeah, forget about it. My
mom would never let me go.

34:28.016 --> 34:29.766
We can go... hidden.

34:48.925 --> 34:51.284
What's fun about an Eclipse?

34:53.956 --> 34:58.456
-Watching the moon disappearing from the
sky -What do you mean disappearing?

35:02.034 --> 35:04.003
-It disappears...

35:04.722 --> 35:08.003
I mean... it ceases
to be illuminated.

35:08.847 --> 35:10.566
Meaning...?

35:12.988 --> 35:13.878
Wanna see?

35:14.971 --> 35:16.846
Do you know when
you're sunbathing

35:17.315 --> 35:20.143
And you feel warmth on
one side of your face?

35:21.284 --> 35:25.378
Well, that side of your face is
being illuminated by the sun.

35:26.065 --> 35:27.987
What does that have to
do with the eclipse?

35:34.050 --> 35:35.128
Wait up.

35:49.617 --> 35:50.742
Give me your hand.

35:52.399 --> 35:53.899
here's the sun.

35:53.930 --> 35:55.649
Earth.

35:55.992 --> 35:57.789
And the moon.

35:58.744 --> 36:00.369
The sun illuminates the earth

36:00.603 --> 36:02.166
The moon.

36:02.587 --> 36:04.900
And your face.

36:05.525 --> 36:10.572
The eclipse happen when all
three are perfectly aligned

36:10.728 --> 36:15.259
And the light that was on the
moon, is not there anymore.

36:15.284 --> 36:20.087
And since we can only see what's
illuinated, we can't see the moon

36:20.539 --> 36:23.711
But it's really fast.

36:23.736 --> 36:25.586
And we can see the moon again.

36:26.414 --> 36:28.492
-Get it
-I think so.

36:29.429 --> 36:32.179
Funny, tryin to explain this.

36:32.554 --> 36:33.898
It looks so simple.

37:39.092 --> 37:43.326
Leo, I forgot my hoodie in your bedroom.
Can you bring it to me tomorrow?

37:43.351 --> 37:45.639
-Yes I can. No worries.
-Thanks.

37:50.388 --> 37:52.247
-See ya
-See ya

40:18.095 --> 40:22.095
Ma, for how long have you
and pops been together?

40:22.923 --> 40:26.189
It's been a long time...
let me see... 71...

40:27.657 --> 40:30.032
Wow... 42 years.

40:30.057 --> 40:32.298
Wow, that's a lot of time.

40:32.829 --> 40:34.376
Do you still love each other?

40:35.079 --> 40:39.079
Some days more than others...

40:39.900 --> 40:41.806
How'd you two meet?

40:41.831 --> 40:44.634
It was before we
came to São Paulo.

40:44.659 --> 40:48.353
He was the bus driver, for the
bus I took to go to work.

40:48.712 --> 40:57.025
In reality, I could take a later bus, but I
always got on a little early, just to go with him

40:57.050 --> 41:00.322
I remeber one day i was late.
I was desparate

41:03.728 --> 41:06.853
To my surprise, he
was still there.

41:06.878 --> 41:09.509
Refusing to leave
until I got there.

41:09.534 --> 41:12.728
And the people all
screaming at him, a mess.

41:12.753 --> 41:17.869
And when I got there, they
weren't happy at all.

41:19.759 --> 41:22.181
It's really early for your
mom to come pick you up

41:22.206 --> 41:26.846
No. It's Gabriel. We have to work on a
project and I asked him to meet me here.

41:32.456 --> 41:35.237
Really?

41:38.237 --> 41:39.706
Hello?

41:42.001 --> 41:43.188
That's me

41:45.219 --> 41:46.485
Really?!

41:50.485 --> 41:55.001
Shoot, Andreia, they can't.
My parents are travelling.

41:55.026 --> 42:00.469
They're only coming back next week. Is
it okay if I call you when they're back?

42:02.448 --> 42:03.948
Okay, Thanks.

42:05.463 --> 42:07.307
You're parents are travelling?

42:07.854 --> 42:10.651
No. I was the lady from
the exchange agency.

42:10.963 --> 42:14.854
She said she found an american agency
that specializes on blind kids.

42:14.879 --> 42:18.354
-Why did you lie?
-I don't know.

42:19.948 --> 42:22.213
Your mom will never allow it.

42:22.736 --> 42:24.205
Thanks for the support, Gi.

42:24.230 --> 42:25.330
Hi!

42:25.596 --> 42:26.814
-Hey...
-Hey.

42:26.839 --> 42:28.861
How are you? Have you
seen Gabriel around?

42:29.346 --> 42:31.158
He's gone to the bathroom and
will be right back, why?

42:31.183 --> 42:33.689
Nothing. I just wanted to
talk to him about something.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.361
He's cute, huh, Gi?

42:38.386 --> 42:40.596
And those hair curls. So cute!

42:44.394 --> 42:47.050
He's not from São Paulo.
Where is he from again?

42:47.075 --> 42:49.316
-I think he's from...
-He's over there, kisses.

42:51.691 --> 42:53.832
She's really a slut, huh?

42:56.129 --> 42:58.862
See? She already got him...

42:58.925 --> 43:02.738
Being all cute, talking to
him, playing with her hair...

43:03.394 --> 43:05.566
She touched his shoulder!

43:06.488 --> 43:10.535
She's holding his hand! She doesn't
even know if he washed it!

43:11.144 --> 43:13.379
Too bad she doesn't even
try to cover it up, right?

43:21.269 --> 43:23.269
I don't think you need
the cane anymore.

43:25.551 --> 43:26.754
Okay.

43:29.501 --> 43:32.766
Did you hear Karina's
question on Chemestry class?

43:33.032 --> 43:35.798
-What a shame. So dumb.
-Poor girl...

43:37.063 --> 43:39.188
Poor girl, but kind
of boring, right?

43:39.213 --> 43:41.266
You think she's cool?

43:41.291 --> 43:43.798
I think she's nice.

43:43.823 --> 43:46.891
-She even invited me to
her party -What party?

43:46.916 --> 43:53.649
The super party she's hosting. She's moving and the
house will be empty. She invited the whole classroom.

43:53.674 --> 43:56.149
-Fun, huh?
-Watch your step.

43:57.321 --> 43:59.102
I'm even going to be the DJ.

44:00.133 --> 44:01.008
Why?!

44:01.587 --> 44:04.133
I like Karina, Leo. Why
don't you like her?

44:04.158 --> 44:06.446
It's not that I
don't like her...

44:06.471 --> 44:11.290
It's just that a party full of people from our
classroom is the last place I want to be at.

44:11.743 --> 44:15.868
Think about it. It could be fun. People
are different outside the school.

44:15.893 --> 44:18.540
-I doubt it...
-Aren't you?

44:23.339 --> 44:24.714
Should I leave the
door open, Leo?

44:24.996 --> 44:26.730
No, you can close it.

44:36.149 --> 44:37.156
Hey Gi.

44:38.282 --> 44:39.227
Yes, I am.

44:41.133 --> 44:42.953
Giovanna, wants to talk to you.

44:44.782 --> 44:45.758
Hey, Gi.

44:49.095 --> 44:51.329
Shoot... Sorry, my phone
must be in my backpack.

44:53.290 --> 44:54.923
I'm home. We're about
to work on the project

44:57.574 --> 45:00.433
What? Weren't you gonna stay to
work on the project with Larissa?

45:04.777 --> 45:06.582
Sorry, Gi.

45:08.204 --> 45:10.555
Giovanna?

45:13.876 --> 45:14.946
What?

45:15.467 --> 45:18.303
Giovanna was pissed as fuck cause we
didn't wait for her by the exit...

45:18.493 --> 45:21.236
But wasn't she going to work
on the project with Larissa?

45:21.275 --> 45:23.220
Apparently, no...

45:44.571 --> 45:45.508
Let's go, Leo?

45:46.235 --> 45:49.868
Without Giovanna? No way,
Gabriel, She would kill us.

45:50.845 --> 45:53.673
She justs passed us
without saying bye.

45:53.698 --> 45:57.259
-Really?
-Really.

45:58.332 --> 46:01.214
Then... Let's go.

46:15.158 --> 46:16.384
Hey, Leonardo.

46:17.517 --> 46:19.064
New boyfriend?

46:22.395 --> 46:24.848
This boy is doing you some good!

46:24.873 --> 46:26.613
You're becoming a man!

46:36.932 --> 46:38.768
-It's hot.
-Thanks, mom.

46:41.491 --> 46:44.467
I was thinking about studying abroad.
What do you guys think?

46:45.780 --> 46:48.397
-Do what, Little Lion?
-An exchange.

46:48.422 --> 46:52.030
The other day some people at school
talked about it and now I want to do it.

46:52.537 --> 46:55.842
-Are you talking about living outside of the country?
-Yeah.

46:55.867 --> 46:58.132
You can only be joking, Leo...

46:58.157 --> 47:01.788
-Here we go...
-Go? No, we're ot going anywhere...

47:01.813 --> 47:04.661
-Explain it to us a little better, son.
-Explain what?!

47:04.686 --> 47:05.951
Are you crazy?

47:05.976 --> 47:09.967
-There's no way Leo's going abroad on his own and that's final.
-But why?

47:09.992 --> 47:12.953
-Why, Leo?
-A lot of people do it. What's the problem?

47:12.978 --> 47:17.399
Even if we agreed, we would
take a blind boy in their home?

47:33.081 --> 47:35.689
-Where'd you get this?
-In an exchange agency.

47:35.714 --> 47:37.807
There's one in Los Angeles
that is for blind people.

47:37.832 --> 47:41.451
-Let me see...
-Their number is there if you want to call to see who's taking care of me.

47:41.476 --> 47:45.392
-How's your English? Is it good?
-There's no discussion, Leo. You're not going. Period.

48:32.045 --> 48:34.045
It must be cause I swim a lot.

48:34.446 --> 48:36.430
I did it a lot back in my city.

48:40.885 --> 48:43.065
Sometimes I hit the gym, too.

48:46.237 --> 48:48.159
What are you doing here?

48:51.819 --> 48:54.389
Yeah, I can tell.

48:58.970 --> 49:02.509
We could go for a swim
together one of these day.

49:03.337 --> 49:05.338
Shoot. I don't have my togs...

49:12.768 --> 49:14.854
Who said we need it?

49:16.936 --> 49:18.376
You're on, girl.

49:18.637 --> 49:21.423
Gabriel, answer me!

49:27.385 --> 49:29.755
You have my phone number, right?

49:48.559 --> 49:49.418
Dad

49:53.586 --> 49:55.305
Dad!

49:57.545 --> 50:00.982
What, son? Are you okay?

50:01.007 --> 50:04.081
Can you help me to shave?

50:05.696 --> 50:07.701
Wait up.

50:08.196 --> 50:11.164
Here you go.

50:14.784 --> 50:20.357
Give this to me,
and get the cream.

50:22.570 --> 50:25.305
That's too much. Hold up.

50:25.330 --> 50:27.284
I'll throw some of it out.

50:27.309 --> 50:29.411
There. now spread
it on your face.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.307
It's me.

50:41.416 --> 50:44.229
Watch your mouth.

50:46.702 --> 50:51.156
Let me see. Yeah, you
can wash your hands.

50:55.347 --> 51:00.920
Now but the Gillette in the hot water.
You'll see it will be much easier.

51:15.172 --> 51:20.849
Son, I was thinking about that
exchnage thing you talked about.

51:20.874 --> 51:23.583
-Really?
-Really, but you can't talk while you shave.

51:23.608 --> 51:24.886
Sorry...

51:26.995 --> 51:33.063
I'm trying to understand why
you want to go so far away...

51:33.088 --> 51:37.776
I think it's very natural for
you at your age to want to...

51:40.414 --> 51:42.862
I don't know, see new places...

51:43.383 --> 51:48.487
Meet different people, make new friends,
I don't know, I think that's normal.

51:49.607 --> 51:56.247
But I think it's very natural for you to
fight with your parents all the time.

51:56.272 --> 51:59.216
I was like that too...

51:59.241 --> 52:05.857
But I think that leaving the country
to escape the fight is too radical.

52:07.523 --> 52:09.190
Get it?

52:10.076 --> 52:13.096
So...

52:13.121 --> 52:15.896
I don't know, I was thinking about
talking to your mom about that.

52:19.464 --> 52:27.225
But first I need to know if you want to travel for
the right reasons. Do you agree, Little Lion?

52:31.105 --> 52:34.699
-Shh, do you agree?
-I can speak now?

52:34.985 --> 52:37.407
Agreed, dad.

52:40.845 --> 52:43.292
-What do you think?
-Let me see... psh

52:56.890 --> 52:59.702
Are you having fun?

52:59.727 --> 53:01.707
-What's his name?
-Pudim

53:01.732 --> 53:04.963
-Hey, Pudim, drink up, dude.
-No, he's a "baby"

53:09.911 --> 53:12.489
You know Pudim? Pudim,
this is Giovanna.

53:14.364 --> 53:16.812
Hey, Pudim...

53:16.837 --> 53:19.312
Get up out of there. Go dance!
Are you gonna stay there?

53:22.427 --> 53:25.005
-Hey
-Hey!

53:25.030 --> 53:27.141
-So. Eyeballing anyone?
-Did you see who came?

53:27.166 --> 53:28.520
Oh yea, that's true!

53:28.545 --> 53:29.875
Go for it!

53:29.900 --> 53:31.828
Hey, Dj.

53:31.853 --> 53:34.432
-Hey.
-Pudim wants to request a song!

53:34.535 --> 53:38.026
-Put him on his little bed, please?
-Tired, Pudim?

53:38.051 --> 53:39.901
He's a baby, he goes
to sleep early.

53:47.714 --> 53:50.943
Go dance. You look like
Giovanna, sitting still.

53:50.968 --> 53:54.068
I'll go dancing soon.

54:23.223 --> 54:26.609
What are you guys hiding?
-Nothing...

54:27.936 --> 54:31.191
We have Vodka and Whisky.
Want some?

54:33.354 --> 54:34.734
Pure?

54:46.600 --> 54:48.318
Careful, huh?

54:48.343 --> 54:51.339
-Cheers
-Cheers!!

55:05.688 --> 55:07.485
Leo, come dance.

55:11.821 --> 55:16.196
-Karina, I set up a playlist, It's going to play for a while, okay?
-Of course, enjoy.

55:17.759 --> 55:20.623
Leo? You on the floor?
Finally, huh?

55:20.648 --> 55:22.342
Interesting, huh?

55:27.238 --> 55:29.035
Don't forget about
dancing with your feet.

55:37.941 --> 55:40.467
I'm gonna go grab something
to drink, you want anything?

55:40.492 --> 55:44.526
-I'll go with you.
-Oh no, now that you started to dance you're gonna dance here with me.

55:44.551 --> 55:46.636
I'll be right back.

55:48.459 --> 55:52.209
Leo, I actually wanted to
talk to you about something

55:52.234 --> 55:55.542
-Right now?
-Yeah, It's better now that we're alone.

55:57.001 --> 55:58.980
Okay.

55:59.005 --> 56:02.001
Did Gabriel ever talk
to you about me?

56:02.026 --> 56:05.308
-What do you mean?
-Like... if he's into me.

56:06.688 --> 56:07.912
No...

56:20.082 --> 56:22.713
What's up, Gigi?

56:22.738 --> 56:25.845
Let's kill the longing
of out last party?

56:26.176 --> 56:30.527
If I were to kill something, it wouldn't
be longing from our last party.

56:30.879 --> 56:32.418
So, that's how it's gonna be?

56:32.443 --> 56:33.448
Yes.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.128
Okay.

56:37.573 --> 56:39.682
What's up, Rodrigo?

56:44.261 --> 56:45.167
What's up, Gi?

56:46.136 --> 56:47.463
What are you drinking?

56:47.488 --> 56:48.432
Don't know...

56:48.457 --> 56:49.925
What do you mean you don't know?

56:52.276 --> 56:53.440
Can I try it?

57:00.776 --> 57:03.580
You could help me out.
Throw him some hints.

57:03.605 --> 57:05.721
-Sure..
-Oh Really?!

57:05.746 --> 57:07.964
Thanks, Leo. You're a sweetheart

57:08.237 --> 57:10.206
Okay. So I'll check
out the party, okay?

57:20.778 --> 57:23.473
It's time for the kissing game!

57:23.498 --> 57:25.455
Yeah, go. Make a circle.

57:26.017 --> 57:28.181
What's up, Leo?
Come play with us.

57:28.206 --> 57:31.845
-No, thanks -C'mon, Leo.
Stay, it'll be fun!

57:31.870 --> 57:33.400
No, I don't feel like it.

57:33.425 --> 57:34.327
C'mon, Leo.

57:35.104 --> 57:36.202
Or do you want to be a
kissing virgin forever?

57:36.227 --> 57:40.679
-You're such an asshole, Fábio, I don't have
a problem with the game -Prove it, and stay.

57:41.735 --> 57:43.391
Okay. I'll stay.

57:43.416 --> 57:44.470
Let's sit there, then.

57:44.495 --> 57:45.939
Dmitri, move...

57:46.907 --> 57:48.993
Turn, turn, there. Sit.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.363
So, I'll start

57:52.388 --> 57:53.839
I'll spin the bottle.

57:53.956 --> 57:55.621
And whoever it's pointing at

57:55.660 --> 57:57.542
Will have to kiss me.

57:59.464 --> 58:00.558
Cool.

58:04.470 --> 58:06.642
Shouldn't you be taking
care of your little buddy?

58:07.666 --> 58:09.579
He's okay.

58:09.765 --> 58:13.046
Actually, you're the one
that should talk to him.

58:13.373 --> 58:15.553
Talk about what? He doesn't
like me anymore. That's it.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.796
That's absurd, Giovanna

58:18.965 --> 58:22.528
It's true. And to top it all, he
doesn't care about talking to me.

58:23.254 --> 58:26.934
Wait... Weren't you the one
that didn't answer his call?

58:27.190 --> 58:29.503
Cause he thinks that you
don't want to talk to him.

58:31.592 --> 58:33.069
This is all your fault

58:33.436 --> 58:35.319
My fault, Why?

58:35.717 --> 58:38.201
Things were great
before you arrived.

58:38.226 --> 58:40.538
Now I'm not even talking
to my best friend.

58:47.285 --> 58:49.324
Let's go matheus, represent!

59:01.638 --> 59:04.607
And there was that time you went to
the movies and didn't even invite me.

59:06.631 --> 59:09.349
Gi... it wasn't on purpose.

59:09.382 --> 59:11.623
Leo didn't do it on purpose.

59:11.648 --> 59:12.775
Of course he did.

59:13.689 --> 59:19.681
He doesn't even want me to take him to his
place anymore. It's all you, you, you, you...

59:23.615 --> 59:24.529
There it is...

59:25.225 --> 59:27.021
You don't even know
how to respond...

59:39.982 --> 59:41.826
Sorry guys.

59:41.959 --> 59:42.897
Cow...

59:47.858 --> 59:49.295
Very well...

59:49.475 --> 59:51.209
Ladies & Gentlemen...

59:51.249 --> 59:55.040
This is the moment many
of us were waiting for.

59:55.533 --> 59:59.384
I believe many of you are
here, just because of her.

59:59.537 --> 01:00:01.568
Am I right, Marta?

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.725
Me?

01:00:02.748 --> 01:00:04.107
No... Marie...

01:00:05.357 --> 01:00:06.553
Idiot...

01:00:13.932 --> 01:00:15.277
Scored!

01:00:15.302 --> 01:00:17.472
You really scored, dude.

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:19.277
C'mon, get up, Marta.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.038
Gui, help him up.

01:00:21.523 --> 01:00:22.898
Get up, Get up.

01:00:26.995 --> 01:00:29.236
Sorry for getting
between you and Leo.

01:00:31.229 --> 01:00:33.229
Too late, huh?

01:00:33.626 --> 01:00:35.102
Sorry, anyway...

01:00:37.704 --> 01:00:40.345
I just wanted to understand
Leonardo, you know?

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.266
This whole exchan ge story...

01:00:43.615 --> 01:00:46.709
He didn't even think about
me, staying here alone.

01:00:48.287 --> 01:00:52.373
How can your best friend want to leave
without even thinking about you?

01:00:52.852 --> 01:00:53.702
Wait...

01:00:53.727 --> 01:00:55.704
What exchange story?

01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:59.532
Leonardo wants to study
abroad, didn't he tell you?

01:01:01.598 --> 01:01:02.434
No.

01:01:02.965 --> 01:01:04.637
Stay calm, people.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:08.715
I think that, since this is a really
important moment in little Leo's life,

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.211
I think we should put some music on.
What do you guys think?

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.466
But that's not what matters...

01:01:34.922 --> 01:01:37.789
It matters that he doesn't care
about me anymore. He switched me

01:01:37.814 --> 01:01:40.548
for you in ten seconds and it's
almost like he didn't notice.

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:43.415
-It's not like that, Gi.
-It's like that exactly.

01:01:44.738 --> 01:01:47.769
You don't know how things were
before you came around...

01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:52.167
Why don't you tell
him that, then?

01:01:54.129 --> 01:01:56.301
We should say the
things we feel.

01:01:57.593 --> 01:01:59.413
It doesn't help to keep it.

01:02:02.062 --> 01:02:02.812
Right?

01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:16.984
A little more.... yes,
just a little bit.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.437
Are you guys crazy!?

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.682
Giovanna, what are you doing?!

01:02:28.307 --> 01:02:30.362
Giovanna, are you crazy!?

01:02:30.699 --> 01:02:34.668
-Let's just go, Leo.
-I can't believe you're jealous because of Marta as well...

01:02:35.425 --> 01:02:38.199
Weren't you the one saying
I had to kiss someone?!

01:02:38.726 --> 01:02:40.101
Look, Gi...

01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:45.132
I was bummed that we were
separated, but you're different...

01:02:45.492 --> 01:02:47.773
I don't know if I can
trust you anymore.

01:02:48.352 --> 01:02:50.195
Go fuck yourself, Leonardo.

01:02:53.602 --> 01:02:54.774
Where's Giovanna?

01:02:55.094 --> 01:02:56.344
She left.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:03:00.107
Why? The party is
great, Gabriel.

01:03:00.623 --> 01:03:03.865
You want to act like Giovanna?
Why don't you go after Karina?

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:06.999
-Seriously, Leo, Let's go... It's late.
-Gabriel, I don't get it...

01:03:07.335 --> 01:03:11.757
First you drag me to the party and now you
want to drag me out of it? What's happening?

01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:14.315
Answer me, Gabriel.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.999
Why are you talking to me like that?
Why are you so mad?

01:03:17.024 --> 01:03:19.980
Cause everyone wants to control me
and nobody wants me to kiss anybody!

01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:12.393
No new calls.

01:04:24.913 --> 01:04:27.834
Leo, I'm going to the supermarket.
You want anything?

01:04:28.229 --> 01:04:31.643
-I'm going with you, mom.
-Wow...

01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:34.119
Get out of this
room a little bit.

01:05:35.376 --> 01:05:37.118
Let's go guys!

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.165
Let's go. We're late.

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.836
Hurry up. To the bus.

01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:27.953
What's up, Leo?
You're not coming?

01:06:28.453 --> 01:06:31.609
-You're the last one. Want some help?
-Thanks.

01:07:03.024 --> 01:07:04.860
Guys, Guys!

01:07:04.885 --> 01:07:08.717
I'm gonna have to call your name,
cause there are two people missing...

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:14.215
There, there. Not
missing anymore.

01:07:17.348 --> 01:07:19.020
You have such dirty minds.

01:07:19.824 --> 01:07:21.581
Let's go, Gabriel. There's
a seat back there.

01:07:28.032 --> 01:07:33.829
Here are the rules and instructions
of the trip. If you brought a tent...

01:07:42.574 --> 01:07:43.621
Leo.

01:07:44.402 --> 01:07:48.113
I collected it for you. Keep
this tiny bottle with you.

01:07:48.138 --> 01:07:49.245
Thanks.

01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:53.550
-We'll analyze that in the lab later. Okay?
-Professor!

01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:57.628
-There's a form that need filling. Ask for a friend to help you...
-Okay.

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:01.956
So you can do that later.
Anything I'm right here, okay?

01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:28.621
Good morning, Leonardo.

01:08:29.434 --> 01:08:30.426
Good Morning.

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:33.684
So... how's your project?

01:08:36.974 --> 01:08:37.880
Good...

01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:39.067
Let me see it...

01:08:43.232 --> 01:08:46.787
Dude, I think your zoo-plancton
is not very happy.

01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:49.287
How's yours?

01:08:50.053 --> 01:08:53.014
Mine's really hungover,
that's for sure.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.192
Karina's party was crazy, huh?

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.759
I don't remember anything...

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:09.703
What do you mean?

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:12.328
I was completely drunk...

01:09:16.562 --> 01:09:19.960
All I remember is being in the
bathroom discussing with Giovanna.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.406
-You drank that much?
-I guess so...

01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:39.987
Where are those locks?

01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:41.493
Wait for it to dry.

01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:44.033
There you go.

01:09:50.129 --> 01:09:51.269
Wanna go to the chair?

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.410
Yes.

01:10:12.537 --> 01:10:14.834
Are you gonna use
some sunscreen, Leo?

01:10:14.859 --> 01:10:16.951
No. I hate sunscreen.

01:10:17.326 --> 01:10:19.037
Not even on your face?

01:10:20.225 --> 01:10:21.725
Okay.

01:10:35.633 --> 01:10:37.250
There's a little leftover.

01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:42.883
What about your body?

01:10:45.365 --> 01:10:47.169
You're starting to sound
like my mom, Gabriel.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.193
I think the relationship
is getting spiceeyeah

01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:02.576
Take care of your
life, you clown.

01:11:02.911 --> 01:11:05.060
Look at him getting pissed off.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.079
So, Leo... Let's go? We've
waited long enough...

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:27.353
Of course not. I'm not showering
with a bunch of people, Gabriel.

01:11:27.378 --> 01:11:30.314
-That's so childish...
-It's not childish.

01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:32.860
-Shit... It's so embarrassing.

01:11:32.885 --> 01:11:35.556
Well, Leo. Get over it.
I'm going...

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:37.668
No. Wait, Gabriel.

01:11:40.973 --> 01:11:41.684
Dummy.

01:11:44.873 --> 01:11:47.983
There's no one here. Somebody
must've left it running.

01:11:52.647 --> 01:11:54.709
Take off your clothes and I'll
help you getting in the shower.

01:11:55.194 --> 01:11:56.170
I'm ready.

01:11:56.405 --> 01:11:58.584
What do you mean 'ready'?
You're showering in your togs?

01:11:58.609 --> 01:12:02.209
-Yeah.
-Ahh, Leonardo.. You're a funny guy.

01:12:05.813 --> 01:12:06.680
Let's go?

01:12:10.922 --> 01:12:12.743
Here. Put your things here.

01:12:46.535 --> 01:12:48.996
Man, this sunscreen
just won't get off.

01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:51.028
Use more soap, then...

01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:26.046
I was thinking about
drinking today.

01:13:27.576 --> 01:13:29.224
Look at that...

01:13:29.624 --> 01:13:31.686
There's always a
first time, right?

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.405
We could drink
together, Gabriel.

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.256
Are you drinking?

01:13:36.197 --> 01:13:37.455
I think so.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.534
Well, Leo. I'm done here.

01:13:48.559 --> 01:13:50.878
-Already?
-Already.

01:14:15.621 --> 01:14:18.058
Is your Zoo-Plancton
still hungover?

01:14:18.847 --> 01:14:21.402
-Yes.
-Hi Ga, hi, Leo.

01:14:21.738 --> 01:14:23.105
-Hey
-What's up?

01:14:23.296 --> 01:14:25.578
Ah, I love that shirt, Gabriel.

01:14:25.757 --> 01:14:26.726
Thanks.

01:14:27.093 --> 01:14:28.835
So, are you guys excited?

01:14:29.117 --> 01:14:30.484
I'm a little bit tired.

01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:33.619
Ah, stop it. The party just begun.
Today we're seeing the sun rise.

01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:36.619
Maybe you will, I
won't see anything.

01:14:36.775 --> 01:14:38.736
Aww, I'm sorry.

01:14:38.983 --> 01:14:40.358
Didn't you say you wanted
to drink today, Leo?

01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:43.780
That was before. Now
I'm feeling lazy.

01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:46.280
Ah, no. We're drinking tonight.

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.252
Is Giovanna around?

01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:58.892
She's right there,
pretending she can't see us.

01:14:59.054 --> 01:15:01.359
Are you not talking
to Giovanna, Leo?

01:15:02.124 --> 01:15:05.742
-I don't know.
-You should talk to her, Leo.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:09.695
-Talk about what, Gabriel, seh can see us.
If she wanted to talk to me she would

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.000
Called me?

01:15:11.025 --> 01:15:12.641
Sit.

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.625
-Why?
-Sit with us.

01:15:19.734 --> 01:15:24.178
-Well, me and Karina are getting something to Drink.
-We are?

01:15:24.203 --> 01:15:26.046
Yes. We'll be right back.

01:15:40.507 --> 01:15:41.733
I'm sorry.

01:15:42.411 --> 01:15:43.810
What for?

01:15:43.835 --> 01:15:46.783
Not being brave enough to talk to me
and asking Gabriel to do it for you?

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:47.807
No, Gi.

01:15:48.846 --> 01:15:50.322
What for, then?

01:15:50.987 --> 01:15:52.791
I don't know. So much...

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:55.506
Then start from the begining.

01:16:00.481 --> 01:16:02.981
Sorry I talked to you like
that at Karina's Party.

01:16:03.006 --> 01:16:05.567
Shit, Leo. They were gonna
make you kiss a dog.

01:16:05.592 --> 01:16:08.192
-What?
-What what?

01:16:08.217 --> 01:16:09.809
What dog?

01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:13.552
-Oh, Leo.
-Giovanna, what dog?

01:16:16.474 --> 01:16:20.786
When I dragged you out of the party, Fábio
was holding up a dog in front of you.

01:16:28.487 --> 01:16:30.800
Thanks for getting
me out of there

01:16:30.825 --> 01:16:34.005
I'm sorry too. I think I
exxagerated when I was mad at you.

01:16:34.466 --> 01:16:39.310
-But you changed me for Gabriel so quickly.
-Of course I didn't, Gi. I'll never change you.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.896
Imagine an eclipse.. you know?

01:16:42.342 --> 01:16:46.654
Earth is in the way of the moon, and it
disappears from the sky, but it's stil there.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:50.461
And then the earth gets out of the
way and you can see the moon again.

01:16:50.914 --> 01:16:54.586
-Just like us -I'm not understandinganything.
What does that have to do with us?

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:57.864
It's just that if this were an eclipse Gabriel
would be the Earth and you would be the moon.

01:16:57.889 --> 01:17:00.216
And you'd be the sun, handsome?

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:03.708
Yeah.... nah, c'mon, it depends.

01:17:03.733 --> 01:17:06.317
If it were a solar
eclipse, you'd be the sun.

01:17:06.504 --> 01:17:08.809
Gorgeous...

01:17:20.556 --> 01:17:22.368
Where's Earth?

01:17:22.575 --> 01:17:25.333
Hangin out with meteor Karina.

01:17:26.622 --> 01:17:28.005
Wanna go drink with them?

01:17:30.106 --> 01:17:31.223
Yup.

01:17:50.294 --> 01:17:52.044
Didn't see them yet?

01:17:52.474 --> 01:17:53.489
No.

01:17:53.522 --> 01:17:55.764
Are you sure you can't
see them anywhere?

01:17:56.537 --> 01:17:57.959
No, Leo.

01:17:58.905 --> 01:18:00.553
Maybe they're hooking up...

01:18:00.912 --> 01:18:02.186
You think so?!

01:18:02.549 --> 01:18:04.775
Ah, they've been
so close lately.

01:18:05.517 --> 01:18:08.791
Wanna know what? Let's go
drinking without them, then.

01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:10.861
Where do you think
there's vodka?

01:18:12.831 --> 01:18:15.238
Hey, Carlinhos.
You've got any Vodka?

01:18:15.263 --> 01:18:18.488
Giovanna? Karina's party
did you some good, huh?

01:18:18.513 --> 01:18:20.941
Yeah, maybe I'm an alcoholic.

01:18:20.966 --> 01:18:23.406
-Come in.
-Wait up, Leo's here.

01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:31.243
-Get in.
-Excuse me.

01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:36.853
Welcome to my HQ

01:18:40.025 --> 01:18:42.572
-Are you drinkin, Leo?
-Yup.

01:18:42.657 --> 01:18:44.759
-Wicked....

01:18:47.263 --> 01:18:48.904
Thanks.

01:18:49.247 --> 01:18:51.943
Carlinhos, have you
seen Gabriel around?

01:18:52.271 --> 01:18:56.138
I did. He was with Karina.
But that was a while ago.

01:18:56.163 --> 01:18:59.099
Those two don't
ever let go, huh?

01:19:00.075 --> 01:19:01.849
Cheers!

01:19:18.658 --> 01:19:19.744
Am I good looking?

01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:21.728
What do you mean?

01:19:22.306 --> 01:19:25.173
Do you think people
think I'm good looking?

01:19:26.431 --> 01:19:27.697
I do.

01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:34.728
Not you, Gi... I mean, do you think
other people think I'm good looking?

01:19:35.382 --> 01:19:40.179
I don't know, Leo. I never noticed
other people's reactions. Ask Karina

01:19:41.272 --> 01:19:44.554
Nah... she thinks Gabriel
is good looking.

01:19:47.654 --> 01:19:50.099
Will you miss me, if
I go study abroad?

01:19:52.216 --> 01:19:53.662
Very much.

01:19:54.188 --> 01:19:57.836
-Me too.
-Do you think we would still be friends if you went?

01:19:57.861 --> 01:19:59.664
Of course.

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:09.310
-I need to tell you something
-Wow, how serious.

01:20:10.966 --> 01:20:14.286
-It's because it's not
simple -Just say it, Leo...

01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:16.158
Is there anyone close?

01:20:18.065 --> 01:20:20.057
Everyone is very far.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.158
I think I'm in
love with Gabriel.

01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:34.091
Hey...

01:20:35.653 --> 01:20:39.567
-What do you mean "in love"?
- In love like "Boyfriend"

01:20:43.952 --> 01:20:45.546
Aren't you gonna say anything?

01:20:46.562 --> 01:20:49.772
-I'm out of drinks, Leo.
I'll go get some -Gi?

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:44.715
Leo!

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.715
-Get in the water!
-Come, Leo. It's really good.

01:21:50.061 --> 01:21:54.147
Thanks, guys. I'm looking for Giovanna.
Have you guys seen her anywhere?

01:21:54.172 --> 01:21:58.554
-No, but she's probably sleeping.
-Seriously. Get in the water. It's so good.

01:21:58.579 --> 01:22:01.489
-Yes! We're gonna see the sun rise!
-Karina!

01:22:01.739 --> 01:22:04.098
Sorry, I always forget.

01:22:04.231 --> 01:22:06.515
I can't guys, I
don't have my togs.

01:22:06.545 --> 01:22:10.750
We don't either! Who
says we need it?

01:22:10.775 --> 01:22:13.539
Come quick!

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:48.217
Leo, you're so hot.

01:22:49.577 --> 01:22:50.928
Here's the thermometer.

01:22:54.592 --> 01:22:56.303
I can't believe you got sick..

01:22:56.974 --> 01:22:59.513
Aren't you the
responsible adult?

01:22:59.592 --> 01:23:02.224
-It's just a col, mom...
-Cold...

01:23:02.249 --> 01:23:05.393
You teacher told me you were
swimming in the middle of the night.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.558
Here's some tea.

01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:18.873
And we're supposed to let you
study abroad after this, huh?

01:23:19.613 --> 01:23:24.402
-It sounds like you never did anything
wrong -I did, but this is different.

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:29.184
-Why?
-Cause you're my son, Leo. I don't want anything bad happening to you.

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:32.388
-It doesn't matter what
you're like -Yeah, right.

01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:37.450
-One day you'll have your own kids, and youll get it.
-Not me. I don't want kids.

01:23:37.475 --> 01:23:39.890
No? Why not?

01:23:40.523 --> 01:23:44.335
-There's a lot of people in the world already.
-You can adopt one.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:48.736
One day you'll meet someone,
Start dating and who knows?

01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:53.439
-I doubt it -What do you doubt? That you'll
be dating or that you'll want to have kids?

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.629
Both.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.387
You're too young. You shouldn't try
to force things... A lot of things...

01:24:02.223 --> 01:24:05.004
A lot of things will happen.
A lot will change...

01:24:06.102 --> 01:24:08.657
You're still gonna have
lots of colds and flus.

01:24:09.493 --> 01:24:13.055
It's good for you to know that I'm
gonna keep trying to keep you healthy

01:24:22.666 --> 01:24:25.549
-Soon I'll call you for lunch, okay?
-'Kay.

01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:47.018
Hi.

01:24:47.894 --> 01:24:49.238
Hey, Gi.

01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:51.491
How are you?

01:24:52.163 --> 01:24:53.233
Good. You?

01:24:54.124 --> 01:24:55.522
I'm okay.

01:24:57.803 --> 01:24:59.045
I see...

01:25:03.115 --> 01:25:05.021
I heard you got sick?

01:25:05.818 --> 01:25:07.708
Yeah, I did.

01:25:09.779 --> 01:25:11.701
You think you're gonna
go to school tomorrow?

01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:14.622
I don't know.

01:25:17.442 --> 01:25:20.028
So... you like Gabriel, huh?

01:25:21.036 --> 01:25:21.832
Dummy.

01:25:30.138 --> 01:25:32.419
Sorry I dodged the bullet.

01:25:32.715 --> 01:25:35.559
It's just that I never
thought about you like that.

01:25:36.503 --> 01:25:39.464
Well, I never thought we
would fight either.. so...

01:25:39.524 --> 01:25:44.579
-Weren't you that wanted a big drama?
-No. I wanted a Romance. Like you do.

01:25:44.717 --> 01:25:50.131
But in my case there's also some drama.
Cause my romance is hooking up with Karina.

01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:53.584
-Is he though?
-It's quite obvious...

01:25:54.076 --> 01:25:55.725
You said it yourself...

01:25:57.029 --> 01:25:59.303
But we never know
those things...

01:26:00.693 --> 01:26:02.146
You, for example...

01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:08.261
I think you two would
be a cute couple...

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.010
Have you talked to Leo?

01:26:21.806 --> 01:26:25.361
-He sent me a text.
Said he was sick -Yeah.

01:26:26.888 --> 01:26:29.271
You should stop by his place.

01:26:29.497 --> 01:26:33.130
Today's Wednedsay. He's there...
alone

01:26:39.176 --> 01:26:41.597
-Who is it?
-Gabriel.

01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:51.093
Only I got sick, huh?

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:53.304
Oh, Poor little feller...

01:26:54.659 --> 01:26:58.831
But Karina did say that that pool was
really bad on her hair. Too much chlorine.

01:27:07.003 --> 01:27:08.245
Did you hook up with Karina?

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.784
No... Why?

01:27:11.909 --> 01:27:16.706
You guys vanished at camp. And
everyone was talking about you two.

01:27:21.356 --> 01:27:22.699
Well...

01:27:22.724 --> 01:27:26.223
Remember that time you were
alone talking to giovanna?

01:27:26.248 --> 01:27:29.031
I thought I should leave
you two alone solving your

01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:31.624
things and went looking
for drinks with Karina.

01:27:32.577 --> 01:27:35.420
When I got there, she
tried to kiss me.

01:27:35.445 --> 01:27:37.224
But I turned my face.

01:27:37.249 --> 01:27:39.154
Shoot. What did she do?

01:27:39.179 --> 01:27:41.177
Asked me why I didn't
want to kiss her.

01:27:41.202 --> 01:27:44.888
-What did you tell her?
-Made up some girlfriend I have in Itapira.

01:27:45.194 --> 01:27:48.335
After I said that, she
opened her heart out....

01:27:48.413 --> 01:27:51.670
And started telling me a
thousand stories from her Ex's

01:27:51.695 --> 01:27:54.467
and I told some stories
about this fake girlfriend.

01:27:54.492 --> 01:27:57.379
The more we talked, the more we drank.
When I noticed,

01:27:57.404 --> 01:28:00.342
we were already in the people.
That's when you arrived.

01:28:02.414 --> 01:28:05.539
You must've drank a lot at
her party, huh, Gabriel?

01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:07.406
What do you mean?

01:28:07.431 --> 01:28:11.422
If you drank so much at camp, and
still remembers everything...

01:28:11.468 --> 01:28:15.585
I wonder how much you had to drink
to have that alcoholic amnesia.

01:28:19.434 --> 01:28:21.606
But, Gabriel... Why didn't
you hook up with her?

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:24.312
Well..

01:28:26.312 --> 01:28:29.382
It's that I actually
like someone else...

01:28:31.856 --> 01:28:33.543
Do I know that person?

01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:35.692
You do.

01:28:36.785 --> 01:28:38.895
And, does this
person like you too?

01:28:40.852 --> 01:28:43.798
I don't know if in the
same way I like them...

01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:46.724
Actually... I've even
kissed this person...

01:28:47.232 --> 01:28:50.161
But it was just a peck.
You know... quick...

01:28:51.157 --> 01:28:53.907
But then I got embarrased, didn't
say anything. They didn't either.

01:28:55.133 --> 01:28:56.883
So I thought I should
just give up...

01:29:03.813 --> 01:29:04.688
Leo...

01:29:05.945 --> 01:29:09.758
If you stole a kiss...
how would you return it?

01:30:06.726 --> 01:30:11.507
The Spartan society was divided between:
Spartiates, Perioikoi, Helots.

01:30:14.819 --> 01:30:19.616
The Spartiates children
were sent to the army....

01:30:21.233 --> 01:30:23.631
-Is this room 211?
-You...

01:30:24.623 --> 01:30:26.060
