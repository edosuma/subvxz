WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:05.166
This is court-ordered mediation.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.339
It's not opt-out mediation

00:07.370 --> 00:10.203
or I-don't_-feel-|ike-it
mediation.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.333
We know that,
but what can we do?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.631
We can't negotiate with a stone.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.069
Yes, but you can lower your ask.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.078
Given the set of facts
I'm looking at,

00:18.110 --> 00:19.475
well, it's way too high.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.408
And the law is far
from clear as to...

00:21.450 --> 00:23.315
Then let's go to court.

00:23.350 --> 00:27.286
Look, the judge doesn't want
to clutter up his docket.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.082
That's why he
empowered me

00:28.120 --> 00:30.350
to keep you here
as long as I want

00:30.390 --> 00:31.425
to reach a compromise.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.620
And I will.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.196
So show me
some movement.

00:34.230 --> 00:37.165
Our client wanted to sue
for $38 million in punitive.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.599
We got her down to 14.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.166
That is movement.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.168
But where is theirs?

00:45.440 --> 00:47.704
Think about a new ask.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.187
I need you to raise your offer.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.551
Oh, come on.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.251
Given the set of facts
I'm looking at,

01:03.290 --> 01:04.848
well, it's way too low.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.596
And the legal issues...

01:06.630 --> 01:07.551
What about their ask?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.568
$12 million for what
was clearly an accident?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.090
$14 million.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.098
Oh, my God.
It keeps going up.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.437
No, it was always
$14 million.

01:14.470 --> 01:17.166
Exactly, because they
won't move.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.632
That's Will Gardner's M.O.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.377
He gets his opposition
negotiating with themselves

01:21.410 --> 01:23.571
so he can just
sit back and...

01:26.220 --> 01:28.245
Okay, the
good news is,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.282
they've agreed to an
increase in their offer.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.639
Really?

01:31.690 --> 01:33.180
Yes--
$100,000.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.414
As a goodwill gesture.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.654
But it's linked
to an equwalent

01:35.690 --> 01:37.226
_ reduction
in your ask.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.579
We're not meeting in the middle.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.257
You are meeting
in the middle.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.121
Everyone's meeting in the
middle, or I keep you here.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.422
This was an unfortunate
aCCIdent...

01:45.470 --> 01:46.539
Wait a minute.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.629
I know Celeste works
under the mistaken impression

01:48.670 --> 01:50.331
that if she says something
enough times,

01:50.370 --> 01:51.302
it'll make it true,

01:51.340 --> 01:54.503
but this wasn't an accident;
this was fraud.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.373
Deposition 101, page 58.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.140
_ "But wasn't this
an aCCIdent, ma'am?" Answer...

02:00.180 --> 02:02.444
No, an accident
is unintentional.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.288
What your client did to me
was intentional.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.753
You sound angry, ma'am.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.849
Do I?

02:10.460 --> 02:13.349
Iguess I am. I...

02:14.500 --> 02:16.365
WILL:
Would you like
to take a break, Maggie?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.322
Can we get you anything
for your pain?

02:18.370 --> 02:19.598
CELESTE:
Thank you, Mr. Gardner.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.289
Why don't we let Maggie
raise her hand

02:21.340 --> 02:23.365
when_she wants to take a break
instead of continually

02:23.410 --> 02:24.604
vocalizing her pain
into the record?

02:24.640 --> 02:26.608
Wow, Celeste. Cynical much?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.608
Only since your fifth
interruption.
Thank you,

02:28.640 --> 02:29.675
but I don't
need a break.

02:29.710 --> 02:30.699
She doesn't need
a break, Will.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.479
Can I continue now?

02:32.520 --> 02:33.475
WILL:
It's up to you.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.216
CELESTE:
This was all caused
by an accident

02:36.250 --> 02:37.478
four years ago,
wasn't it?

02:37.520 --> 02:38.942
I was in a car accident.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.709
It caused DDD--
degenerative disc disorder.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.387
It's misaligned vertebrae discs.

02:43.430 --> 02:47.719
And Dr. Farland, the man
you are suing, my client,

02:47.760 --> 02:49.421
suggested an
operation.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.562
He did.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.728
He said I needed an SCS--
a spinal cord stimulator.

02:53.770 --> 02:57.228
A device like this?

02:57.270 --> 02:58.760
Our client was given
a chance to choose

02:58.810 --> 03:00.437
which model
to have surgically implanted

03:00.480 --> 03:03.347
from a catalogue
of 12 FDA-approved models.

03:03.380 --> 03:06.770
But she didn't choose any--
that's the defense's point.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.210
Yes, but I expected him to pick
one of the FDA-approved devices.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.411
I was never told _
there was another option.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.315
And what happened after
the operation, Maggie?

03:15.360 --> 03:17.328
The pain was gone.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.827
I was ready
to worship

03:18.860 --> 03:20.555
Dr. Farland.
ALICIA:
But then the pain
came back?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.363
Yes, it was like a
deal with the Devil.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.799
It came back
three times worse.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.866
But that's not why
you brought suit.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.128
No. About a month

03:27.170 --> 03:32.699
after my operation, I received
an itemized bill for the SCS.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.732
On it was listed the
manufacturer and the inventor.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.509
And who was the inventor?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.313
My doctor, Dr. Farland.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.817
And this device
he invented--

03:40.850 --> 03:42.545
it was not FDA-approved?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.444
That's right.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.015
He just implanted it
in me like I was a guinea pig.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.914
MEDIATOR:
I want to sympathize--

03:48.960 --> 03:53.294
I do-- but you can't keep
asking for $14 million.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.592
ALICIA:
Maggie has three children.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.518
She is in _
constant pain.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.289
Her life has been shortened
by a decade.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.489
Her husband left her,

04:00.540 --> 04:01.791
and she's being kicked
out of her house,

04:01.840 --> 04:03.705
all because she cannot
hold down a job

04:03.740 --> 04:05.765
or offer spousal
companionship.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.004
Now, if that happened to me

04:07.040 --> 04:10.999
from a doctor who experimented
on me without my knowledge,

04:11.050 --> 04:14.440
I'm sorry, but I would be asking
for twice as much.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.487
Good job. Keep on him.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.680
And, everyone,
the mediator's threatening

04:24.730 --> 04:26.527
to keep us here
through the weekend,

04:26.560 --> 04:28.755
and I think he means it,
so make arrangements.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.961
(cell phone beeping)

04:31.000 --> 04:32.968
We might have a slight edge
in mediation.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.991
The mediator seems sympathetic.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.803
Really? Will that matter?

04:36.840 --> 04:38.068
Not really.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.805
We're heading to trial
either way,

04:39.840 --> 04:41.307
but it shows _
our argument's working.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.568
What's up there?

04:42.610 --> 04:43.907
I just got a call.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.339
Someone who needs
cri5is management.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.517
One of our clients?

04:47.550 --> 04:50.587
No, someone impressed with
the Florrick rehabilitation.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.939
(chuckling):
Oh, wow.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.481
Now I'm starting to feel
like a slacker.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.387
Eli is starting to clock
more billable hours than us.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.523
Who is it, one of the airlines?

04:59.560 --> 05:02.028
I heard a jet
went off the runway at O'Hare.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.324
No, but I might be able
to sign them.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.689
I can decide for both of us?

05:05.730 --> 05:07.391
Yes. Just keep me in the loop.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.691
Mm-hmm.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.868
Cheese.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.105
Cheese?

05:14.140 --> 05:17.576
Yes. We represent
the Wisconsin State Dairy Guild,

05:17.610 --> 05:19.475
and we need your help.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.784
With cheese?
Yes.

05:25.790 --> 05:29.351
A certain kind of cheese
or all cheese?

05:29.390 --> 05:30.857
There was an_ outbreak
of listeri05is

05:30.890 --> 05:32.528
in a Chicago
grammar school

05:32.560 --> 05:33.788
four hours ago.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.525
News reports say
the outbreak

05:35.560 --> 05:38.427
was traced to bacterial-
infected cheese slices.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.664
Five children
are hospitalized,

05:39.700 --> 05:41.463
four teachers
are ill,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.104
and we're getting alarmed calls
from government officials.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.804
Does the guild have a contract
with an existing PR firm?

05:48.840 --> 05:49.738
Keyser & Associates.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.702
They're working
on an "Eat Cheese" campaign.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.809
Not anymore.
You hire me, I am one voice.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.670
Tell me if that's okay,
or we go no further.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.142
I'll have to get
permission.
That's fine for now,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.782
but I need someone here
who doesn't need

05:58.820 --> 05:59.787
to get permission.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.549
Agnes, hello.
Get... get me...

06:01.590 --> 06:02.682
Monthly retainer
of $60,000 a month.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.686
Hourly still applies.
You'll find that's competitive.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.459
Fine.
Get me everything

06:06.500 --> 06:07.853
on listeriosis,

06:07.900 --> 06:10.869
anyone who will speak
out against cheese.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.868
And I'll need more
investigator time. Get Kalinda.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.730
She's on the mediation.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.169
Not anymore.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.067
Mm-hmm. 60...
60 a month...

06:18.110 --> 06:19.577
W-wait, hold on.

06:19.610 --> 06:20.770
NEWSCASTER:
...may also be tainted.

06:20.810 --> 06:21.731
It was just after recess.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.874
The culprit--
the most innocent of foods.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.741
Cheese.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.543
This cell phone video,
Oh, dear God.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.616
shot by a cafeteria worker,

06:30.650 --> 06:32.618
captures several students
becoming gravely ill...

06:32.660 --> 06:33.649
We're worried
this is gonna

06:33.690 --> 06:34.816
keep people
from purchasing cheese.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.725
You think?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.648
Cheeseburgers
and grilled cheese sandwiches...

06:38.690 --> 06:40.021
ELI: You'll have to hire
Lockhart/Gardner

06:40.060 --> 06:41.823
as temporary counsel.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.963
Actually, we have
outside counsel.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.729
Okay, I can explain myself
for now,

06:44.770 --> 06:45.623
but when things move faster,

06:45.670 --> 06:47.797
you're going to have
to just trust me.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.728
Currently, everything we say
and do can be subpoenaed

06:49.770 --> 06:50.566
f_or_civil or
criminal trial.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.498
And believe me,
with news like this,

06:52.540 --> 06:53.734
you do not want that.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.678
We need to be
able to speak

06:54.710 --> 06:55.631
under_cover of
attorney-client prIVIlege,

06:55.680 --> 06:58.774
which Diane provides,
and we need it now!

06:58.810 --> 07:00.778
(newscast continues
indistinctly)

07:00.820 --> 07:02.845
Go ahead, get permission.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.181
Hi, Walter.
Still there?

07:06.220 --> 07:08.882
We also need to hire
Lockhart/Gardner

07:08.920 --> 07:09.682
as temporary counsel.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.153
NEWSCASTER:
...as we learn more.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.852
And get me the CEO
of Heather Farms--

07:14.900 --> 07:16.925
before he talks to a reporter.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.831
Here he comes now.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.030
You just tell him
what you told me.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.833
What's wrong?
Is everything all right?

07:23.870 --> 07:24.905
I don't know.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.807
I got a call from someone
at the Vindicator.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.502
She asked if I had an
opinion about the results

07:30.550 --> 07:32.916
of the medical investigation
of Dr. Farland.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.645
The...?
I don't understand.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.908
It's a year off.
I know.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.918
She said the FDA expedited it.

07:37.950 --> 07:40.783
She got an early look, and
they're siding with Dr. Farland.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.924
ALICIA:
It may not be true.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.120
It doesn't matter.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.787
Any rumor
of an investigation

07:45.830 --> 07:47.229
that goes
against us hurts us.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.251
Did this reporter say
when she wanted a comment?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.063
This afternoon.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.830
She has to go to press Monday
with the leak.

07:53.870 --> 07:54.996
Here's her number.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.928
She's the
Metroeditor.

07:56.970 --> 07:59.234
Kate Hanson-- I know her.
Let me give her a call.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.737
She'll be easy
to stall.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.839
Thank you for doing this.
(cooing)

08:02.880 --> 08:04.939
Once more around
the park.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.845
(baby fussing)

08:06.880 --> 08:08.575
(engine starting)

08:08.620 --> 08:09.882
So what do you think?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.979
I think we have
a gun to our head,

08:12.020 --> 08:12.850
and can't wait
for trial.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.949
We have to get a good deal
in mediation.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.526
Damn!
Be right there.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.949
Owen, can you do me a favor?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.888
Diane, we...

08:21.930 --> 08:23.727
I'll call you back.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.736
I think the mediator's
lying to us.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.692
I think you're right.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.002
Two hours
and a bottle of wine,

08:30.040 --> 08:31.769
we can settle this.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.131
Just this? Why not
the Middle East?

08:34.180 --> 08:37.809
It's game theory with
imperfect information, Will.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.977
Why don't we
make it perfect?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.908
I thought you
liked imperfect.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.680
Poker over chess.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.849
You sure you're on
the right floor?

08:47.890 --> 08:48.959
I'm serious.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.629
We used to settle a lot
of things in the old days.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.594
We used to unsettle
a lot of things, too.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.858
I'm going into my room now.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.027
You haven't heard our case yet.
It's a good one.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.992
Then I can't wait.
Good-bye, Celeste.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.260
My number.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.803
When you're ready
to negotiate.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.201
(elevator bell dings)

09:22.890 --> 09:25.120
The whole weekend?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.229
Maybe not the whole one.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.295
It's hot, right?
The nights are hot?

09:27.330 --> 09:29.321
Oh, steaming.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.933
Sultry with the scent
of jasmine, forbidden love.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.062
Coat, no coat?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.102
No coat.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.209
You're fine with this, right?

09:38.240 --> 09:40.231
I just need someone
with the kids through Sunday.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.975
Sure. The fun uncle.

09:42.010 --> 09:42.999
I'm the fun uncle.

09:43.050 --> 09:47.009
So you and Will
in a hotel room.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.369
Yes.

09:48.420 --> 09:51.139
Will, me, four lavwers,
six of their lawyers

09:51.190 --> 09:52.009
and a mediator.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.813
You and Will checking
out the hot tub.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.010
In a businessman's hotel.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.187
The best sex I ever had
was in a businessman's hotel.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.653
Oh, okay.
Can we not go there?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.122
(laughs)
You are so funny.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.323
You are the most prudish
wanton woman I know.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.230
Hey.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.067
What was that?

10:12.110 --> 10:13.372
What? Nothing.
I have to go.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.173
But you were about
to say something.

10:15.210 --> 10:17.405
You won't get in a fight
with Peter, right?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.270
He's picking up the kids
for dinner Saturday night.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.119
I didn't mean it--

10:21.150 --> 10:22.811
about the "wanton."

10:22.850 --> 10:24.909
Alicia, talk to me.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.349
Owen, I would if I had the time.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.051
You have to wait
for the elevator,

10:28.090 --> 10:30.058
so talk to me here.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.819
Okay.

10:31.860 --> 10:32.929
You're sleeping with Will,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.996
which is why you left
your husband.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.156
(elevator bell dings)

10:36.200 --> 10:37.963
Oh, come on.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.195
I'll call you later.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.298
(phone ringing)

10:41.340 --> 10:43.001
Gretchen Battista.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.008
No, Kate retired
three months ago.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.009
I'm her replacement, Mr....

10:48.040 --> 10:50.144
Gardner.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.171
Yeah, so you'll be
getting a package

10:52.210 --> 10:54.144
in about an hour or 50,
Ms. Battista.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.078
Just ignore it.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.088
Oh, I already got it.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.712
My parents drink Scotch.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.082
They'll be really grateful.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.348
And what might you need?

11:02.390 --> 11:04.028
You contacted my client
for comment

11:04.060 --> 11:05.254
on the FDA investigation.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.690
I thought I might help.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.823
You wouldn't happen to be
fishing for what I might know,

11:09.870 --> 11:10.825
would you, Mr. Gardner?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.326
I might be.

11:12.370 --> 11:14.167
I just find it odd that you'd be

11:14.200 --> 11:16.395
the only reporter
leaked an FDA decision.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.237
Maybe I'm just
a better reporter.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.135
And maybe you have a source
that's lying

11:20.180 --> 11:23.308
and trying to undermine
this negotiation.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.069
So come in for an interview,
and you can offer some context.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.772
Okay. How about lunch
on Monday?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.117
Oh, you mean after my deadline?

11:30.150 --> 11:31.947
Oh, I don't think so.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.719
How about in my office
in one hour?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.954
Two hours.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.082
(phone beeps)

11:36.120 --> 11:38.782
I thought we had agreed this
morning to lower your ask

11:38.830 --> 11:40.320
by $100,000.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.157
Yes, and we reevaluated
our position,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.065
and we're staying
with our original ask.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.161
(laughs)

11:47.200 --> 11:49.134
I'm glad you
think it's funny.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.161
I thought we were
making progress.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.269
Oh, we are making progress.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.107
Mr. Gardner has a tell.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.869
When he's in trouble,
he doubles down.

11:56.910 --> 12:00.016
So we're lowering
our offer.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.075
You don't you think
the issues here

12:02.120 --> 12:04.111
are too serious
to treat like gambling?

12:04.150 --> 12:07.415
No, gambling is too serious
to treat like these issues.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.212
We're lowering our offer.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.887
(elevator bell dings)

12:12.900 --> 12:14.094
You all right?

12:14.130 --> 12:15.256
No.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.255
Okay.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.928
(cell phone ringing)

12:18.970 --> 12:20.062
Yeah.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.829
What are you doing?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.098
Will wants me to get
some inkling

12:23.140 --> 12:24.368
of their bottom line
in mediation.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.365
Why?

12:25.410 --> 12:26.502
Eli needs your help.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.008
Heather Farms
outside Bloomington.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.100
The USDA is investigating
this listeria outbreak,

12:32.150 --> 12:34.243
and they tend to be slow.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.419
Well, which takes priority,
cheese or mediation?

12:36.450 --> 12:38.315
Both.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.352
All right, got it.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.187
ALICIA: I expect mediation
to extend through the weekend,

12:42.220 --> 12:46.953
at least,
so, um, I will be...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.194
There is no Heather Farms.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.925
It's just one division
of Karpwell Foods.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.164
ELI:
And I don't care.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.565
I'm not your rabbi, sir.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.488
I'm merely trying
to keep your cheese

12:54.540 --> 12:56.804
from damaging the image
of all cheeses.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.434
Well, I'm sorry you feel
that way, but I do care.

12:59.470 --> 13:02.177
It's not even clear
that we're responSIble.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.007
I mean, what else
did these kids eat?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.176
That's what I
want to know.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.507
Oh, yes, that's a great
line of defense.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.518
With images like these,
people love to hear

13:08.550 --> 13:10.586
that the kids
are really the problem.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.144
Do you know
who Tony Hayward is?

13:12.190 --> 13:13.509
Do I...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.915
Yes, he's the CEO
of British Petroleum.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.154
No, ex-CEO of BP.

13:17.190 --> 13:20.250
The man who many think oversaw
the destruction of a brand.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.450
So first thing's first,
we work on your attitude.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.365
Excuse me?
I think we need to work on...

13:24.400 --> 13:26.220
Look, I don't have time
to argue with you.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.261
The first rule_ _
of managing a cri5is:

13:28.300 --> 13:30.006
the top man
answers the questions.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.133
That is the only
reason you're here,

13:32.170 --> 13:34.001
that is the only reason
I am talking to you.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.837
So, in ten minutes time,
you're giving a press conference

13:35.880 --> 13:38.269
where you'll order all your
cheese products off the shelves.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.208
We need a split screen

13:39.250 --> 13:42.413
of that image
with you looking strong--

13:42.450 --> 13:44.247
wrong tie, get him a red tie--

13:44.290 --> 13:45.587
then you'll apologize

13:45.620 --> 13:48.919
for any missteps
and say the buck stops here.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.154
Actually, he can't do that.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.329
Actually, he can and he will.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.555
No, legally,
he's in a very vulnerable spot.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.591
He can't be out there
apologizing and taking blame.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.564
He's gonna get sued
no matter what.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.238
Yes, but the size of the
suit is still in question.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.294
I don't care about
the size of the suit, Diane.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.329
Yes, Eli, but I do.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.338
I'll just sit here then.

14:04.370 --> 14:05.906
Diane, you're only here
as window dressing.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.908
You're only here to keep us
from getting subpoenaed.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.874
No, I'm here as their lawyer.
You're working the images...

14:09.910 --> 14:11.548
And the images
take precedent right now.

14:11.580 --> 14:14.071
Eli, listen to me...
He won't have
a busmess unless he...

14:14.120 --> 14:16.987
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Protopapas.

14:17.020 --> 14:19.079
Dr. Farland was
stopping by for lunch.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.417
But if you have
any questions...

14:22.460 --> 14:25.349
Ms. Serrano,
could I speak with you?

14:25.390 --> 14:26.618
This is
really inappropriate.
We were having lunch.

14:26.660 --> 14:27.797
It's been on the
books for weeks.

14:27.830 --> 14:30.924
I am not listening to any
evidence off the record, ma'am.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.961
And I am not
offering any.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.297
I'm standing
on the record.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.261
So is the plaintiff.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.665
And they offer
a convincing case.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.339
An easily-refuted case.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.406
Mrs. Reeves is responsible
for her own condition.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.308
How do you figure?

14:44.350 --> 14:45.601
Deposition 200,
page 14.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.073
It's so key, I know
it from memory.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.248
"Question: If there's nothing
wrong with your device, Doctor,

14:51.290 --> 14:52.541
how did it malfunction?"

14:52.590 --> 14:53.955
It didn't
malfunction.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.287
Even the best SCSs

14:55.320 --> 14:56.582
are prone to lead migration.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.087
CELESTE:
And a lead is...?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.189
Oh, sorry.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.653
When the electrical leads
don't stay where intended.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.225
It's usually not serious,
but in the case of Maggie,

15:05.270 --> 15:07.238
it became quite serious
because the problem

15:07.270 --> 15:08.965
went undetected
for so long.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.366
That's what caused
the infection,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.275
which caused the permanent
damage to her spine.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.232
And why did it go undetected?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.248
Well, I prescribed
hydromorphone

15:17.280 --> 15:19.305
for any topical pain
from the surgery,

15:19.350 --> 15:22.319
but Mrs. Reeves-_- I'm
sorry to say this--

15:22.350 --> 15:25.148
but she_ continued to use the
painkiller long afterward.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.614
CELESTE:
So, if Mrs. Reeves hadn't
overmedicated herself,

15:28.660 --> 15:30.252
she would have
noticed the infection

15:30.290 --> 15:32.258
and come to you for
her SCS adjustment?

15:32.290 --> 15:33.427
Yes.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.325
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reeves,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.260
but it's true.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.494
WILL:
Oh, come on.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.669
Why not blame the victim for
having pain in the first place?

15:40.700 --> 15:43.066
Yes, but is it true?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.429
The device malfunctioned,
the pain returned.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.233
Only then did Maggie
take the painkillers.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.532
Celeste reverses it
so she can make it

15:47.580 --> 15:49.207
seem like the painkillers
caused the problem.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.319
IfI can get her up to
eight million, will you say yes?

15:54.350 --> 15:55.419
Is she offering
eight million?

15:55.450 --> 15:56.712
Will you accept it?

15:56.750 --> 16:00.356
If you're asking for our
bottom line, then no.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.255
We can't give you
our bottom line

16:02.290 --> 16:05.179
or they'll use it
against us.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.288
(phone chimes)
Where's Kalinda?

16:06.330 --> 16:08.321
I thought she was looking
into their bottom line.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.169
I'll call.
Where are you going?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.418
To meet a reporter.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.461
REPORTER:
Tonight, school officials
are reassuring parents

16:14.500 --> 16:17.333
that all cheese has been removed

16:17.370 --> 16:19.338
from the school lunch menu
for the time being.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.533
It's not yet clear whether
cheese at neighboring schools

16:22.580 --> 16:25.208
and stores in the area
may also be tainted.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.740
Grace!

16:26.780 --> 16:28.645
Stop eating the pizza!

16:28.680 --> 16:30.045
Really?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.409
You were the bad one?

16:31.450 --> 16:34.385
Well, yeah, I was.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.513
Don't I seem like
I was the bad one?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.027
So, in what way bad?

16:38.060 --> 16:40.722
Mm, no, you don't
want to hear this.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.751
No, I do want
to hear this.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.397
Ecstasy.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.399
Driving my car into a lake,
stealing stuff, juvie.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.600
And Mom?

16:52.640 --> 16:55.234
She was perfect.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.147
Homework done, room clean,
never did drugs.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.169
Never did anything.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.043
She's still like that.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.489
She was a good sister.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.589
Always covering for me.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.212
You guys have a good mom.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.184
(hip-hop music playing loudly
in distance)

17:11.230 --> 17:13.653
Grace's tutor.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.792
* Let me take a shot

17:14.830 --> 17:17.196
* I'm 'a sit down, get a drink,
let you work it out *

17:17.230 --> 17:19.460
* Step back, Akinyele,
"Put It in Your Mouth" *

17:19.500 --> 17:21.229
* Have a cocktail, never fail,
turn your body out *

17:21.270 --> 17:22.737
JENNIFER:
The stuff on the staircase!

17:22.770 --> 17:24.135
GRACE (laughs):
Yeah!

17:24.170 --> 17:26.229
Hello!

17:26.270 --> 17:27.737
Hello. Can we turn it down?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.338
(lowers volume)
Sorry.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.507
We're almost done.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.246
So you're the, uh, the tutor?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.372
Uh-huh.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.614
What subject?

17:36.650 --> 17:38.242
Uh, physics.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.383
And just science.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.251
Really?

17:42.290 --> 17:43.757
Where do you go to school?

17:43.790 --> 17:46.122
Uh, U of C.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.752
And, um...

17:47.800 --> 17:49.290
* You deserve every single
dollar *

17:49.330 --> 17:50.399
* And your assets make me
want to... *

17:50.430 --> 17:51.499
What's this?

17:51.530 --> 17:52.758
GRACE:
We're making a video.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.199
We're done with all my homework.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.639
Uh-huh. Got it.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.206
Understood.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.264
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.279
* Trip down, turn around,
show me what it is *

18:01.310 --> 18:03.346
* Trip down, turn
around, show me what it is *

18:03.380 --> 18:05.439
* Show me what it is,
show me what it is... *

18:05.480 --> 18:08.244
Pretty...

18:08.280 --> 18:09.679
provocative stuff.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.518
(snickers)

18:12.550 --> 18:13.710
It's just street dancing.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.217
Yeah, just freestyle.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.381
(music continues faintly
in distance)

18:22.300 --> 18:24.291
Dad slept with
somebody else.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.530
Dad. He slept with someone
other than the hooker.

18:30.570 --> 18:32.367
He...

18:34.380 --> 18:35.335
How do we know?

18:35.380 --> 18:37.644
He told me.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.307
That's why Mom kicked him out.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.318
You didn't know that?

18:43.320 --> 18:44.844
I didn't know that.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.355
KALINDA: _
What are they saying?

18:52.390 --> 18:54.199
MAN:
They think it was
an improper cleaning

18:54.230 --> 18:55.754
of the culture vats
in Line Six.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.291
You sound like
you don't agree.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.366
Well, I clean Line Six
with peroxyacetic acid

19:00.400 --> 19:02.561
and quaternary ammonium
after every culture.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.431
They're not gonna find
listeria there.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.301
_Where else could
listeria come from?

19:06.340 --> 19:10.606
We keep these units accurate
to one degree either way.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.369
I don't think it was
a refrigeration problem.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.478
So what do you think?

19:14.520 --> 19:18.286
I think it used to be
an easy job to find the source.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.685
Now you got
some of these cheeses--

19:19.720 --> 19:21.608
they're a blend of
three or four lines

19:21.660 --> 19:22.786
from three or four companies.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.823
So all I can say is
goodluck.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.225
Damn. Are you sure?

19:27.260 --> 19:28.750
KALINDA:
Uh, Eli, you know

19:28.800 --> 19:30.461
this is a good thing, right?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.922
It looks like your client isn't
responsible for the listeria.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.461
Kalinda, this is not the law.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.468
I'm not looking for innocence,
I'm looking for certainty.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.832
The whole point is to bury
this story with an apology,

19:38.870 --> 19:40.303
then move on.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.399
So you want our guy
to be guilty?

19:42.440 --> 19:44.476
No, I want it to be over.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.478
I don't want to train
another CEO

19:46.510 --> 19:48.512
from some other company tomorrow
to take the blame.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.869
DIANE:
He can't say this.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.342
He has to say it.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.278
No, he can say, "I
offer my deepest,

19:53.320 --> 19:54.514
sincerest sympathies
to the families."

19:54.560 --> 19:56.312
And, "I'm doing everything I can

19:56.360 --> 19:58.487
to trace the source
of our missteps."
No.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.349
"The source of
the outbreak."

19:59.390 --> 20:01.358
Really? Really, Diane?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.697
He can't say anything that
sounds like an admission...

20:02.730 --> 20:03.662
Really?

20:03.700 --> 20:05.361
I am doing everything I can

20:05.400 --> 20:07.391
to trace the source
of the outbreak.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.897
Heather Farms is committed
to finding the root of this...

20:09.940 --> 20:11.669
So why should I hold your story?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.871
WILL:
Well, the
Scotch for one.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.434
And because it's not true.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.505
It's not true that Dr. Farland's
being investigated?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.448
No, it's not true

20:18.480 --> 20:20.573
the investigation
is going Farland's way.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.372
And you know this how?

20:22.420 --> 20:24.615
I know this because I can see
who has an agenda.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.515
In this case, the defense.
MAN:
Heads up.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.949
Why should I care?

20:27.990 --> 20:29.480
Because I can
make you care.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.954
Okay.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.424
I'll give you complete
back channel on the case.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.552
(chuckles)

20:35.600 --> 20:38.569
Uh, as pulse-racing
as that is,

20:38.600 --> 20:40.591
get me back channel on this.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.664
Your computer?

20:41.700 --> 20:43.361
Mm, no, the cheese thing.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.264
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.436
The listeria outbreak.

20:46.470 --> 20:49.337
All the sick kids,
some were hospitalized...

20:49.380 --> 20:51.371
Eli Gold is
part of your firm, right?

20:54.780 --> 20:57.340
I'll delay my story,
you get me

20:57.390 --> 20:59.381
the back channel ticktock
on the crisis managing.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.956
I'll have to talk to Eli.

21:00.990 --> 21:05.552
Well, then it wouldn't be
a back channel, would it?

21:05.590 --> 21:07.421
Get me something
behind the scenes.

21:07.460 --> 21:10.793
Let me see what I can do.

21:12.470 --> 21:14.665
it's not the FDA investigation
that's concluding.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.894
What do you mean?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.305
The call I got

21:17.340 --> 21:18.659
was about the State's Attorney.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.859
Turns out,

21:19.910 --> 21:23.038
they decided not to bring fraud
charges against Dr. Farland.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.009
Hello.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.415
May I help you?

21:34.460 --> 21:35.449
You may.

21:35.490 --> 21:38.459
I need information
about a fraud investigation.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.528
Are you sure?
Am I sure I have

21:46.570 --> 21:48.595
nothing to offer you about our
fraud investigation? I am.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.403
We just need to
know if this leak

21:50.440 --> 21:52.533
to Gretchen Battista was
faked, Cary, that's all.

21:52.570 --> 21:55.004
And if it was, then we need
to get her to hold her story.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.372
I understand.

21:57.410 --> 21:58.672
I still have nothing.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.948
How have you been?

22:02.980 --> 22:05.778
Oh, come on.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.618
Kalinda, you can fake somebody
else, but you can't fake me.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.525
What am I faking?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.652
Interest,

22:11.690 --> 22:13.999
concern,
friendship.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.497
And what if I'm not?

22:15.530 --> 22:17.623
Then let's be friends.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.728
(sighs)

22:18.770 --> 22:19.964
But I still don't have
anything for you

22:20.000 --> 22:21.092
about this fraud
investigation.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.596
Check with Matan;
it's his case.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.732
Hmm, he's no use.

22:23.770 --> 22:24.998
Because he doesn't want
to sleep With you?

22:26.540 --> 22:28.531
But you do?

22:29.580 --> 22:31.571
I'm merely making
an observation.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.475
And what observation
might that be?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.976
You tend to _use
people's feelings

22:35.020 --> 22:37.011
to further_
your investigations.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.751
You think that's
what I did with you?

22:43.790 --> 22:46.623
I think I have
to get back to work.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.549
Cary, whatever I felt,
I didn't invent.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.919
That's great
to know, Kalinda.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.689
Now I have to get back to work
and I think you do, too.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.961
Yeah.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.837
NEWSCASTER:
The CEO questioned the need

23:02.880 --> 23:04.848
to recall all cheese products,
suggesting

23:04.880 --> 23:06.871
that the listeria victims
themselves

23:06.910 --> 23:09.014
could have been responsible
for the sickness.

23:09.050 --> 23:10.813
I don't know that much
about it at this point,

23:10.850 --> 23:13.683
but I-I would love to know
what else those kids were eating

23:13.720 --> 23:15.119
because I don't think
it's just the cheese.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.286
Excuse me.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.083
Look, I think it's a little
premature at this point...

23:18.130 --> 23:20.189
What the hell?

23:20.230 --> 23:21.527
What the hell?!

23:21.560 --> 23:23.562
What did you say?

23:23.600 --> 23:25.522
What did you say?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.662
What are you
talking about?

23:26.700 --> 23:27.792
I-I said exactly
what you told me...

23:27.840 --> 23:30.161
"I don't know enough, but
what else did these kids eat"?

23:30.200 --> 23:32.430
You know what you do
when you don't know enough?

23:32.470 --> 23:33.630
You shut
the hell up.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.772
I didn't say that.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.038
With a garbage bag
in your hand?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.968
What are you,
Chico and the Man?

23:38.010 --> 23:40.205
Oh, that-- that was in the
morning, before I met you.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.219
The press was in
front of my house.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.979
They're playing it
like you just said it.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.647
They can't
do that.

23:46.690 --> 23:48.612
Oh, where do you live--
Fairyland?

23:48.660 --> 23:49.888
Of course they can do that.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.626
Okay, Eli, what now?

23:51.660 --> 23:52.558
Well, he's burned
as a spokesman.

23:52.590 --> 23:53.522
You're going
to have to get

23:53.560 --> 23:54.925
all the cheese off
all the shelves in Illinois.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.655
What? No, I don't think
that's possible.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.667
He just blamed
the victim.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.691
It just became possible.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.931
ALICIA:
Owen, thank you so much.

24:03.970 --> 24:07.030
I've been in mediation
all day, couldn't get away.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.173
How are the kids?

24:08.210 --> 24:09.131
Good.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.899
Grace is bonding with
a shy dance teacher

24:11.950 --> 24:15.841
and Peter told Zach that he
slept with another woman.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.780
What?

24:17.820 --> 24:19.788
Oh, Grace is
bonding with a...

24:19.820 --> 24:22.050
No, what did Peter say?

24:22.090 --> 24:25.685
Oh, yeah, he told Zach,
your son, that he, Peter,

24:25.730 --> 24:27.789
was at fault for
you kicking him out

24:27.830 --> 24:29.593
'cause he slept
with somebody else,

24:29.630 --> 24:33.794
and so now I'm wondering
who that somebody else was.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.064
Zach told you this?
He did.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.635
And what did Zach
say to him?

24:40.680 --> 24:41.874
To Pe-- nothing.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.571
I think he just
took it in.

24:43.610 --> 24:44.702
So who, who is it?

24:45.750 --> 24:47.718
I have to go
back to work.

24:47.750 --> 24:48.910
Come on,

24:48.950 --> 24:51.919
Alicia, work is like this
new avoidance tactic for you.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.713
Is Zach all right?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.658
Zach's fine.

24:54.690 --> 24:56.749
Zach... he's, he's
wondering how you are.

24:56.790 --> 24:58.758
How... how are you?

24:58.790 --> 25:00.758
I've got to get
back to work.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.098
(grunts)

25:03.130 --> 25:05.121
(sighs)

25:13.340 --> 25:15.274
There you are.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.198
Kuhn?

25:18.250 --> 25:19.808
Yep, I think
you were up

25:19.850 --> 25:21.772
by 32 last time
we played.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.048
(chuckles)
Nine years ago?

25:23.080 --> 25:26.789
That's right, you always
hated my memory thing.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.253
One Cheerio ante?

25:28.290 --> 25:29.757
Two-- inflation.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.781
(laughs)

25:33.730 --> 25:35.322
So I heard you got married.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.327
Twice.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.691
Heard you didn't.

25:37.730 --> 25:40.164
Hmm.

25:44.070 --> 25:46.732
You were always
bad at bluffing.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.669
Who's the
lady friend?

25:50.710 --> 25:52.678
The. . .?
The lawyer.

25:52.710 --> 25:55.144
I get a strong
possessive sense there.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.239
You're not
gang to say?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.850
I say either way,
you'll use it in negotiations.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.755
(laughs)

26:05.290 --> 26:07.258
(sighs)

26:07.290 --> 26:08.757
Call.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.838
So how do you know
Gretchen?

26:14.870 --> 26:16.189
Gretchen?

26:16.240 --> 26:17.366
The reporter.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.231
Through your firm?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.636
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.171
Hmm, so are we gonna play cards
all night

26:25.210 --> 26:26.302
or are we gonna negotiate?

26:26.350 --> 26:28.841
How about both?

26:28.880 --> 26:32.088
You lose this hand, you convince
your client to take my deal.

26:32.120 --> 26:36.682
I lose this hand, I convince
my client to take your deal.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.721
What deal?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.648
$10 million.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.895
And if I lose?

26:42.930 --> 26:45.694
She takes
$500,000.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.267
So that's your bottom line,
huh, $10 million?

26:51.770 --> 26:53.829
I miss you, Will, I really do.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.769
Why did you
drop out?

26:56.810 --> 26:57.947
I didn't.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.106
Moved on.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.640
To...?

27:00.680 --> 27:02.739
Adulthood.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.942
As I remember, we did some
pretty adult things ourselves.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.615
Come on, one bet.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.997
We settle this
like adults.

27:14.030 --> 27:16.328
No mediator.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.328
Your lady friend
will be so impressed

27:18.370 --> 27:22.238
when you show up at her door
with $10 million in your hand.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.808
No, thanks.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.172
Oh, come on.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.939
Where's the
old Will?

27:29.980 --> 27:31.948
Embrace
the risk.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.777
No, thanks.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.173
Wuss.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.972
(laughs)

27:37.020 --> 27:40.046
Too bad,
you would have won.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.294
(door opens)

27:54.340 --> 27:55.693
Anything?

27:56.740 --> 28:00.130
They want to pay $500,000,

28:00.170 --> 28:02.832
but they're willing
to go to $10 million.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.347
(chuckles)
You're kidding?

28:04.380 --> 28:05.142
Nope.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.944
We were willing to
take $5 million.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.814
(chuckles)

28:11.850 --> 28:14.387
The only bad news is,
I don't think she planted

28:14.420 --> 28:15.853
the story with Gretchen,

28:15.890 --> 28:17.983
but I can't tell.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.453
She's a good bluffer.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.923
Anything else?

28:21.960 --> 28:25.191
Yeah, she's gonna try
to play you.

28:25.230 --> 28:26.891
In what way?

28:26.930 --> 28:28.989
Jealousy.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.008
Using your past?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.905
To what end?
Rattle you,

28:32.940 --> 28:35.272
get you to admit the bottom line
just for the kick of it.

28:35.310 --> 28:38.006
(chuckles)

28:38.050 --> 28:39.199
So you and her, huh?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.912
Two years.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.076
I just don't see it.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.280
I was a different person.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.287
And she's
the same?

28:45.320 --> 28:47.447
Oh, yeah.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.481
Well...

28:53.490 --> 28:57.494
What if I play jealous...

28:58.930 --> 29:00.932
...for the mediator?

29:04.340 --> 29:06.308
Maybe you should.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.331
(chuckles)

29:23.160 --> 29:25.424
Tantric sex.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.825
No, sex sex.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.829
No, no, tantric sex.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.021
You_ have to eschew
frictional orgasm

29:32.070 --> 29:33.867
for a higher form
of ecstasy.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.391
No, can't we have a
little frictional orgasm?

29:36.440 --> 29:39.830
We don't touch,
we don't undress.

29:39.870 --> 29:41.030
We talk
about our childhoods,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.071
anything but sex.

29:43.110 --> 29:47.342
Delaying gratification
is to increase gratification.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.042
Yeah, but I've spent the last
three hours doing laundry,

29:50.080 --> 29:52.310
and the kids are gonna be
home in a couple of hours,

29:52.350 --> 29:55.854
so I don't really have time
for delayed gratification.

29:55.890 --> 29:56.982
(door opens)

29:57.020 --> 29:58.419
They're home early.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.451
(door closes)

30:01.530 --> 30:03.054
Oh, Owen.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.125
Hello. What a surprise.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.364
Uh, how are you?

30:06.400 --> 30:09.437
Jackie, how... funny.

30:09.470 --> 30:11.938
Yes, so Peter asked me
to pick up Zach and Grace.

30:11.970 --> 30:14.370
I hope you don't mind,
I have my old key.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.571
Oh, hello.

30:16.610 --> 30:19.841
Hello.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.017
My name is Finn.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.109
Uh, Finn's a friend
of mine from school.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.981
Jackie, you're
a little early.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.317
Yes, well, I thought
I'd clean up.

30:26.350 --> 30:28.113
It always gets
so messy here.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.219
But, um, why don't
I come back later?

30:30.260 --> 30:34.094
No, no, sit down,
talk with us.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.394
_You must have
incredible stories

30:36.430 --> 30:38.091
to tell about
your life.

30:38.130 --> 30:39.358
Finn, Jackie's early.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.196
She needs to go.

30:40.230 --> 30:43.199
No, no, thi-this is
a perfect moment

30:43.240 --> 30:46.403
for us to learn
about her past.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.635
Tell us about
your childhood.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.635
JACKIE:
My childhood?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.635
FINN:
Yes.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.147
JACKIE:
Where should I start?

30:52.180 --> 30:54.614
Chicago was very different
when I was a girl.

30:54.650 --> 30:55.969
(elevator bell dings)

30:56.020 --> 30:57.988
No, Mommy will help you.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.942
No, Mommy will.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.651
I have to go.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.180
Good-bye.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.881
Kids?

31:04.930 --> 31:06.386
Boy and girl.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.318
You think
this mediation is hard?

31:08.360 --> 31:09.349
(chuckles)

31:09.400 --> 31:11.868
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.268
Hey, they're all tough.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.165
We just have
to remain human.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.600
How do we do that?

31:19.640 --> 31:21.369
Find a box for this

31:21.410 --> 31:24.208
and keep it in that box.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.309
Thank you.

31:27.350 --> 31:30.171
(Celeste and Will shouting)

31:30.220 --> 31:32.188
We are not paying a cent
above her medical bills.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.687
Then let's go to court.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.210
You failed, Will.
I don't have
to put up with this.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.318
Just face the fact.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.315
Okay, stop.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.156
How did I...?

31:38.190 --> 31:39.521
The point of bringing
you two together

31:39.560 --> 31:41.198
is to talk, not to shout.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.390
I know what it looks like
when he fails,

31:42.430 --> 31:44.068
and he is
failing.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.260
Alicia, talk to him.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.562
Excuse me?

31:49.600 --> 31:52.967
I'm just saying, Will and I
talked last night...

31:53.010 --> 31:54.079
WILL:
Celeste...
What?

31:54.110 --> 31:56.078
And we were trying
to negotiate a deal,

31:56.110 --> 31:58.044
but clearly his ego
got in the way,

31:58.080 --> 31:59.104
and I used to be able
to talk to him.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.299
I can't talk
to him now,

32:00.350 --> 32:02.011
so you'll have
to talk to him. _
Celeste, what are you domg?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.517
I'm talking to her.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.988
I'm just saying
that Will and I

32:08.020 --> 32:09.157
got together,

32:09.190 --> 32:11.954
we had a productive
session, that's all,

32:11.990 --> 32:14.026
and I was thinking we
should do that again.

32:14.060 --> 32:18.167
Okay, I think we've taken a turn
towards the personal,

32:18.200 --> 32:19.098
and what I think
we should maybe...

32:19.130 --> 32:20.324
Excuse me.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.269
WILL:
Okay, you want to be productive?

32:31.310 --> 32:33.198
Let's be productive.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.275
You already tried
the blame-the-victim defense

32:35.320 --> 32:38.209
with your painkiller
O.D. fiction.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.319
That didn't work.
Who's saying it didn't work?

32:39.350 --> 32:41.454
Iam.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.283
Well, we'll prove the opposite
in court.

32:46.330 --> 32:48.457
No, you won't.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.491
I know the judge.
He won't allow it.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.331
So maybe you should raise.

32:58.470 --> 33:00.438
Jason Doyle.

33:00.470 --> 33:02.506
Zuggler Med project manager.

33:02.540 --> 33:05.338
Deposition 207, page 13.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.076
What's this?
The backup plan?

33:08.120 --> 33:11.009
"Question: So you believe
you were within your rights

33:11.050 --> 33:12.745
"to manufacture this SCS device,

33:12.790 --> 33:14.781
"and Dr. Farland was
within his rights

33:14.820 --> 33:16.253
to implant it in his patient?"

33:16.290 --> 33:17.518
Of course.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.221
According
to the FDA's own rules.

33:19.260 --> 33:21.228
But Mr. Gardner
seemed to imply

33:21.260 --> 33:24.297
that Dr. Farland
was Josef Mengele.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.763
Josef...?

33:25.800 --> 33:27.768
The...

33:27.800 --> 33:29.438
That's okay.

33:29.470 --> 33:32.337
FDA rules say
that you were within your rights

33:32.370 --> 33:34.634
_to manufacture
this deVIce, correct?

33:34.680 --> 33:38.548
Yes. They allow manufacturers,
like ourselves, to decide

33:38.580 --> 33:41.447
which devices need to be
submitted to them for approval.

33:41.480 --> 33:45.314
And if a_new device is
merely a minor modification,

33:45.350 --> 33:47.318
then, according
to FDA guidelines,

33:47.350 --> 33:49.284
it doesn't need approval.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.120
Ms. Serrano's reading is
surprisingly selective.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.151
Why don't you keep going?

33:56.360 --> 33:58.669
What is this?

33:58.700 --> 34:00.827
Th_at? It's a BR1.
It's a spinal cord stimulator.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.337
And this is FDA approved?

34:02.370 --> 34:03.439
Yes.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.405
And you claim
that Dr. Farland's SCS

34:06.440 --> 34:09.170
is a minor modification of this?

34:09.210 --> 34:10.529
Yes. That's why we didn't need

34:10.580 --> 34:12.377
to submit it to them
for approval.

34:12.410 --> 34:14.378
So, then what is this?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.308
That's Dr. Farland's SCS.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.284
So, you're saying

34:18.320 --> 34:21.084
that this is
a minor modification

34:21.120 --> 34:23.111
of this?

34:25.160 --> 34:28.129
CELESTE:
Ira, you can't judge these
with a layman's eye.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.196
Medical professionals

34:32.230 --> 34:33.561
that these two
deVIces were Similar.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.862
These two?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.629
Yes.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.228
In fact, I anticipated

34:38.270 --> 34:40.568
Mr. Gardner's bringing
this issue up again,

34:40.610 --> 34:42.737
so I had a study done

34:42.780 --> 34:46.170
by the respected Benzor Labs
in Quantico, Virginia.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.269
What's it say?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.618
That it's a minor
modification.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.538
The mediator's on our side.

34:53.590 --> 34:55.751
Yup. Nice job,
by the way, but

34:55.790 --> 34:57.018
he still was impressed by this.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.483
Okay, so we have to get someone
to say it was vastly modified.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.351
We need Kalinda.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.220
I want to repeat,
this is only a precaution.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.328
(phone buzzing)

35:05.370 --> 35:07.497
We are removing all Karpwell
cheese from circulation.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.465
Yeah. Gretchen, I'm kind of busy
right now. What do you need?

35:10.500 --> 35:14.470
So you're the man behind
the cheese, Eli, is that right?

35:14.510 --> 35:16.501
I'm the...

35:16.540 --> 35:17.871
Who told you that?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.878
An unnamed source.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.743
And what else did
this unnamed source tell you?

35:22.780 --> 35:25.681
He said you're crisis managing
for the listeria outbreak,

35:25.720 --> 35:27.347
and that you investigated
Heather Farms,

35:27.390 --> 35:28.914
and the outbreak's not
from there.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.484
NEWSWOMAN:
...the political revival

35:30.520 --> 35:32.727
of scandal-plagued State's
Attorney, Peter Florrick.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.422
He is also known
for being a tough infighter.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.894
Though never confirmed,
Eli Gold was also thought

35:37.930 --> 35:41.536
to be the architect of an ugly
racial attack on his opponent.

35:41.570 --> 35:44.835
So, why is this wholesome brand
hiring a spin doctor

35:44.870 --> 35:47.737
known for rehabilitating
scandalized politicians?

35:47.770 --> 35:50.477
Are you there, Eli?

35:50.510 --> 35:52.501
Hello.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.699
NEWSCASTER:
Eli Gold...

35:53.750 --> 35:55.308
GRETCHEN:
Any comment?

35:55.350 --> 35:56.817
_ _ ...one of _the first
political campaign managers

35:56.850 --> 35:58.545
to understand the power
of social media...

35:58.590 --> 36:00.217
I'm not part of the story.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.478
Oh. I'm sorry, Eli.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.317
You just became part
of the story.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.452
So pull up a chair.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.754
...makes him a highly
sought after crisis manager...

36:12.530 --> 36:13.861
It's not all bad, Eli.

36:13.900 --> 36:15.333
It is all bad.

36:15.370 --> 36:16.530
Youbecome the story,

36:16.570 --> 36:18.401
it deflects from
your client's gUIlt.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.931
I become the story, it makes
my clients look guiltier.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.437
Who leaked it, Diane?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.971
Eli, it's a fool's game
to look for a leaker.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.500
Gretchen knew
we checked Heather Farms.

36:26.550 --> 36:28.211
She knew it was clean.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.808
I told two people
about that-- you

36:29.850 --> 36:32.842
and Kalinda-- but Gretchen
said the leaker was a he.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.711
Did you tell Will?

36:36.860 --> 36:38.828
Oh, he went
to the kids' vigil.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.623
I thought you said
he was burned.

36:40.660 --> 36:41.991
(sighs)

36:42.030 --> 36:43.349
He was.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.526
You're changing
the subject.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.663
I am. So, you tried
to un-burn him?

36:46.700 --> 36:49.533
You haven't seen this yet?

36:49.570 --> 36:51.401
(gasps on TV)

36:51.440 --> 36:52.839
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.679
It's wonderful, isn't it?

36:54.710 --> 36:56.439
People love humility.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.471
Tony Hayward needed
a pie in the face.

36:58.510 --> 36:59.306
You didn't.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.875
Oh, set it up? No.
That was just luck.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.376
I thought he'd just get booed.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.819
MAN (on TV):
...to the services today?

37:04.850 --> 37:06.579
I'm proud to be here today.

37:06.620 --> 37:09.817
I don't care in what condition.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.885
NEWSCASTER: Among those
attending the prayer service

37:11.930 --> 37:13.852
was the CEO of Heather Farms,
Walter Kermani.

37:13.890 --> 37:15.391
I'm good at my job, Diane,

37:15.430 --> 37:17.398
but I can't have leakers.

37:17.430 --> 37:19.489
It's unprofessional.

37:19.530 --> 37:22.294
Will didn't leak.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.331
(crowd chatter,
piano music playing)

37:31.510 --> 37:33.341
So you're here to give up.

37:33.380 --> 37:37.510
Ten million, and we
won't accept a penny less.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.586
Really? (laughs)

37:39.620 --> 37:41.588
You and your lawyer friend
cook something up?

37:41.620 --> 37:44.453
It didn't work for you
to blame the painkiller.

37:44.490 --> 37:46.287
It didn't work for you
to blame the victim,

37:46.330 --> 37:47.456
so minor modification.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.526
That's what your
case rests on now.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.825
Dr. Farland's SCS is
merely a minor modification

37:52.870 --> 37:54.531
of existing SCSs.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.834
Have some pastrami, Will.

37:56.870 --> 37:59.839
Let's leave all this boring
medical talk behind.

37:59.870 --> 38:04.375
The problem is, medicine
is a lot like politics.

38:04.410 --> 38:07.379
And all we had to do
was follow the money.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.378
She never was jealous,
was she?

38:09.420 --> 38:10.773
Your lawyer friend.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.685
That was all a piece
of playacting?

38:12.720 --> 38:15.450
Dr. Farland, your
man of healing,

38:15.490 --> 38:17.981
invented an SCS
to make money.

38:18.020 --> 38:21.285
30% on every
device implanted.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.898
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.090
Who was that?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.562
Kalinda.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.601
Here's a copy for you.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.766
What is this?

38:32.810 --> 38:34.539
Farland's patent
application.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.979
Yeah, I know.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.546
It's a good
read, though.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.104
The problem for you is,

38:40.150 --> 38:42.710
Dr. Farl_and had to insist
on its originality.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.115
I get it.

38:44.150 --> 38:45.947
You don't have
to lord it over me.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.118
No, I won, so you
have to listen.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.583
Dr. Farland had to
insist on the originality

38:51.630 --> 38:53.723
of his device to
file a patent.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.491
"This SCS is a truly
original development

38:57.530 --> 38:59.122
"_in severe back
pain management.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.865
It is not a_ mere
modification..."

39:00.900 --> 39:03.368
How nice of him to
use those words.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.958
"...of existing
SCSs on the market.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.001
Therefore,
patent. . ."
I can read.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.532
You're not going to be
a sore loser, are you?

39:10.580 --> 39:13.048
Eight million dollars.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.638
Ten. By today.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.113
(laughing):
No.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.710
Eight. That's more
than you thought you'd get.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.581
I'll talk to my client.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.111
I need a new home.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.552
You need a...?
New home.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.990
My firm is going under.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.089
Monty & Columbech?

39:32.130 --> 39:33.859
Breaking up.

39:33.900 --> 39:36.391
Litigation's going one way,
acquisitions another.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.658
How many in litigation?
Me.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.508
Eight other top-flight lavwers.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.030
We need a home.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.378
I'll check with Diane.

39:47.750 --> 39:49.741
I miss you.

39:54.590 --> 39:57.184
Ira? Hey.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.484
So, it looks like
we'll make a deal.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.622
I heard.

40:00.660 --> 40:03.754
I just wanted to thank you
for all of your hard work.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.597
You don't have to thank me.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.518
I wasn't the one
who played them.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.197
We...

40:09.240 --> 40:11.196
That's not
why we won.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.867
You won because of the facts.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.698
You got your client rich because
you played them... and me.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.879
That's not fair.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.446
It i fair.

40:20.480 --> 40:23.938
It may not be polite,
but it is fair.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.948
Don't worry about it.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.778
IfI needed a lawyer,
I'd probably hire you, too.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.856
Very nice to meet you.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.225
Hey, Mom.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.659
Just wanted to see
how you were d0ing.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.666
How's your thing?

40:46.710 --> 40:48.575
It was good.

40:48.610 --> 40:51.477
I don't know.

40:51.510 --> 40:53.569
I go back and forth
on work.
Yeah.

40:53.610 --> 40:55.578
Same with Dad.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.818
I want to do something
very old-fashioned.

40:58.850 --> 41:00.715
I want to kiss you
on the forehead.

41:00.750 --> 41:01.887
Is that all right?

41:01.920 --> 41:03.888
(laughs)
Sure.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.495
Tucking in is too much.

41:11.530 --> 41:13.498
Right.

41:13.530 --> 41:15.532
Sorry.

41:17.770 --> 41:19.761
Love you.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.146
(sighs)

41:30.180 --> 41:31.818
I'm getting boring.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.681
Getting?

41:33.720 --> 41:35.859
I'm serious.

41:35.890 --> 41:39.257
I used to be... interesting.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.827
I spent the entire day

41:41.860 --> 41:44.863
doing laundry
and watching daytime TV.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.026
I saw the clothes.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.560
Thank you.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.828
I mean, when did this happen?

41:48.870 --> 41:51.134
You're the one out having sex
with your boyfriend.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.660
Owen...

41:52.710 --> 41:54.632
And I'm the one
at home with the kids.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.501
And it's much
appreciated.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.548
Are you gonna get hurt
by this guy?

42:03.180 --> 42:05.740
I don't know.

42:05.790 --> 42:08.657
I have no perspective.

42:08.690 --> 42:10.681
You should have rebelled
in high school.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.688
Then you wouldn't
have to do it now.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.255
Is that what this
is, rebellion?

42:15.300 --> 42:18.690
Or love.

42:18.730 --> 42:20.789
It's not love, is it?

42:22.140 --> 42:24.335
No.

42:24.370 --> 42:26.668
Good.

42:26.710 --> 42:30.737
'Cause that would make it
very complicated.

42:30.780 --> 42:34.773
Mmm.
