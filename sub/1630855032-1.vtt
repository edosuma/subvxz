00:36.896 --> 00:38.034
[muffled] <i>Chloe!</i>

00:43.379 --> 00:44.068
<i>Chloe?</i>

00:47.896 --> 00:49.000
<i>Chloe!</i>

00:50.068 --> 00:51.344
<i>Be careful!</i>

04:11.724 --> 04:14.655
Is it okay if I speak
and we use that?

04:15.931 --> 04:17.172
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.896
My signing is adequate,
but, this will get fairly detailed.

04:24.206 --> 04:26.724
Okay, so, your address.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.586
Oh, that's Cape Cod, isn't it?

04:28.586 --> 04:29.793
Is that where you're from?

04:31.310 --> 04:32.896
No, no, I'm from Maryland.

04:32.896 --> 04:34.689
I live there with my dad.

04:34.689 --> 04:35.965
He's a doctor.

04:35.965 --> 04:38.000
That's our old, like,
summer house.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.724
I haven't been in years.
We're selling it.

04:41.724 --> 04:42.586
Oh, I see.

04:43.689 --> 04:44.862
So how did you find
out about us?

04:46.206 --> 04:49.103
Online. I've been
following your project.

04:49.103 --> 04:51.000
And no cochlear implant?

04:52.310 --> 04:54.965
No, no the timing was
never right.

04:54.965 --> 04:55.965
Oh, everyone is different.

04:57.310 --> 05:00.034
And with your hearing loss,
profile, and speech,

05:00.034 --> 05:02.724
you are an excellent candidate
for our study.

05:03.896 --> 05:05.931
I still see a speech therapist.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.206
Oh, okay.

05:08.931 --> 05:10.724
So, I have to ask.

05:12.206 --> 05:12.827
Why are you doing this?

05:13.862 --> 05:18.137
Regaining sensory ability
can be quite jarring.

05:22.413 --> 05:23.862
I remember...

05:25.068 --> 05:27.241
hearing sounds...

05:28.275 --> 05:30.000
voices and...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.655
it's still...

05:31.655 --> 05:32.620
inside me.

05:33.758 --> 05:35.793
The silence, it's just
something I've...

05:37.068 --> 05:39.034
adjusted to.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.689
But this...

05:42.103 --> 05:43.620
this is mine!

05:45.862 --> 05:46.655
Okay.

05:48.034 --> 05:50.758
Well, this is a stage one
clinical trial.

05:50.758 --> 05:53.827
Right now, once mature
auditory nerve cells are damaged,

05:53.827 --> 05:54.896
that's it.

05:54.896 --> 05:55.862
Hearing loss is irreversible.

05:57.172 --> 05:59.896
The purpose of this study
is to change that.

06:05.724 --> 06:07.896
<i>We are using
an experimental gene editing technique</i>

06:07.896 --> 06:10.379
<i>that mimics prenatal cellular growth
in the inner ear.</i>

06:16.068 --> 06:17.379
<i>The procedure itself is
relatively simple.</i>

06:18.724 --> 06:22.275
<i>A stem cell-associated
retrovirus
is injected into your inner ear.</i>

06:27.896 --> 06:31.344
<i>This retrovirus will "infect"
the surrounding tissue</i>

06:31.344 --> 06:34.206
<i>with a gene responsible
for auditory cell growth.</i>

06:43.965 --> 06:47.137
<i>The damaged nerve fibers
will grow back, restored.</i>

06:50.379 --> 06:54.344
<i>And your sense of
hearing will return.</i>

07:14.931 --> 07:15.793
<i>You can probably take
those bandages off now.</i>

07:17.413 --> 07:20.379
Just wait to put your hearing aids
back in until tomorrow.

07:22.206 --> 07:24.034
It could be weeks until
we see results.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.172
Kind of like a cold.

07:26.172 --> 07:28.310
We have to allow it to
run its course.

07:29.896 --> 07:30.931
Oh!

07:30.931 --> 07:32.034
Alright,

07:33.137 --> 07:35.379
use these drops twice a day.

07:35.379 --> 07:37.448
Once in the morning and
once at night.

07:37.448 --> 07:39.103
Okay.

07:39.103 --> 07:42.068
It's a steroidal solution
to increase cell growth

07:42.068 --> 07:43.344
and slow the immune response.

07:44.482 --> 07:47.413
You might experience
some minor side effects.

07:47.413 --> 07:52.241
Increased heart rate, light headedness,
dizziness, but nothing too serious.

07:57.275 --> 07:59.137
We're being hopeful.

08:00.448 --> 08:02.000
But, please remember that

08:03.379 --> 08:07.000
there is a strong possibility
this may not work.

08:10.862 --> 08:11.862
Okay.

08:15.275 --> 08:16.241
Oh!

08:17.482 --> 08:20.000
Here you go. This is my card.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.931
Please don't hesitate to email
or text me
if you have any questions or problems.

08:25.034 --> 08:26.034
Okay.

09:53.103 --> 09:54.206
I'm Chloe.

11:24.275 --> 11:25.413
<i>Chloe!</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:54.551
<i>Chloe!</i>

11:57.655 --> 11:59.137
Mom!

12:00.344 --> 12:01.413
<i>Be careful!</i>

15:50.206 --> 15:51.551
<i>Chloe!</i>

15:55.758 --> 15:57.379
<i>Be careful!</i>

20:57.241 --> 20:58.758
<i>Chloe!</i>

21:05.275 --> 21:06.620
Mom!

21:09.034 --> 21:09.965
<i>Chloe!</i>

22:06.172 --> 22:07.586
Hold on, hold on.

22:10.068 --> 22:12.275
Okay... okay... can you say...
can you say that again?

22:15.034 --> 22:18.758
I'm Hank Fowler,
your dad called me about the
water heater.

22:21.896 --> 22:22.862
Right.

22:24.137 --> 22:25.172
Yes, yes.

22:26.206 --> 22:26.931
Thank you.

22:27.896 --> 22:29.931
Yep. Sorry to startle you.

22:39.034 --> 22:40.137
Oh!

22:41.172 --> 22:41.896
You're little Chloe?

22:43.241 --> 22:46.172
Last time I saw you you
were yay high.

22:47.724 --> 22:49.310
Yeah, that was like
twelve years ago.

22:51.724 --> 22:54.034
How are you doing with your...

22:55.068 --> 22:56.068
I've adjusted.

22:57.896 --> 23:00.137
Your dad said you were
in town for some sort of...

23:00.931 --> 23:02.275
study.

23:02.275 --> 23:03.724
Yeah.

23:04.275 --> 23:05.724
To restore my hearing.

23:07.103 --> 23:08.275
They can do that?

23:08.275 --> 23:09.586
Not yet.

23:10.758 --> 23:13.137
It's an experiment, but
we're hopeful.

23:15.965 --> 23:17.655
Good luck with that, wow.

23:19.068 --> 23:20.344
I can get you hot water.

23:22.206 --> 23:23.827
It's in...
I know...

23:49.862 --> 23:51.000
Should be good here.

23:52.172 --> 23:53.103
Okay.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.793
Your dad said you're
looking to sell the place.

24:01.068 --> 24:03.724
I know he tried the
Airbnb thing.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.793
Y-yeah...

24:06.793 --> 24:08.655
yeah, it's just too far for us.

24:09.896 --> 24:11.103
It's time.

24:11.103 --> 24:12.000
Yeah...

24:12.482 --> 24:13.965
I'd say.

24:14.827 --> 24:15.965
All right, well,

24:15.965 --> 24:18.931
if you need anything,
just let me know.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.655
Actually there is one thing.

24:28.206 --> 24:29.965
All right, give it a try.

24:35.379 --> 24:36.206
That's the Swedes for you.

24:37.034 --> 24:38.931
This is older than you are.

24:42.758 --> 24:46.034
I wouldn't drive it back to Maryland
without having it looked at first.

24:48.310 --> 24:49.758
Should have the roads
to yourself this time of year.

24:51.068 --> 24:54.275
Though the off season could get
lonely if you're not used to it.

24:55.448 --> 24:58.241
I saw a light on across
the marsh last night.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.413
Could be late renters.

25:03.827 --> 25:06.793
Though the addicts
like to squat in empty houses.

25:08.034 --> 25:09.448
There's a problem
with that here.

25:14.103 --> 25:15.344
You'll be okay.

25:15.344 --> 25:18.793
I'm down at the harbor most days,
they made me Harbormaster.

25:20.172 --> 25:22.758
If you need anything,
I'm a call away.

25:24.137 --> 25:25.379
Or a text.

25:25.379 --> 25:26.724
I do that too.

25:28.275 --> 25:30.310
Yeah. My dad gave me
your number.

25:31.241 --> 25:32.344
Thanks.

30:49.206 --> 30:50.793
- Can I help you with something?
- Oh.

30:52.103 --> 30:52.689
Yeah.

30:53.413 --> 30:54.655
Is that your truck?

30:56.724 --> 30:57.758
It is.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.586
I'm cleaning out our
old house and...

31:02.517 --> 31:04.000
I could use a truck.

31:07.413 --> 31:08.379
I know you.

31:09.344 --> 31:10.344
Your name is Chloe, right?

31:11.586 --> 31:14.172
We used to play
together as kids.

31:14.172 --> 31:15.275
I'm Joshua.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.620
Do you remember me?

31:21.379 --> 31:22.482
Yeah.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.448
You got real sick

31:26.448 --> 31:28.103
and you lost your hearing
and you never came back.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.206
We were wondering what
was going to happen to your house.

31:33.310 --> 31:35.482
Sorry, can you hear
me right now?

31:45.793 --> 31:46.689
Hmm.

31:50.931 --> 31:51.827
Uh.

31:52.758 --> 31:53.827
Do you live here?

31:55.172 --> 31:56.103
Yeah.

31:56.724 --> 31:58.206
My mom still owns them.

32:01.172 --> 32:03.379
I told her I thought
I saw you the other day.

32:04.448 --> 32:05.172
You should come say hi.

32:06.517 --> 32:08.448
She didn't believe
that you were really back.

32:12.448 --> 32:13.724
She ain't gonna bite.

32:14.862 --> 32:15.862
Come on.

32:38.758 --> 32:40.172
Mom.

32:40.172 --> 32:41.413
Brought the Grayden girl.

32:41.931 --> 32:42.827
Chloe.

32:44.689 --> 32:45.896
Told you she was back.

32:50.965 --> 32:52.482
Isn't she deaf?

32:54.241 --> 32:56.724
She is, but she makes do.

33:02.827 --> 33:03.827
Hello.

33:04.896 --> 33:06.310
I'm Ellen.

33:07.448 --> 33:10.275
I used to watch you
when you were a toddler.

33:12.793 --> 33:14.137
I knew your mother.

33:15.724 --> 33:17.517
We went to high school together.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.310
Before she met your dad.

33:25.827 --> 33:26.517
How's he doing?

33:27.827 --> 33:29.896
He'll be out here in a
couple of weeks.

33:32.034 --> 33:33.310
We're trying to sell the house.

33:34.241 --> 33:35.344
Sounds about right.

33:38.000 --> 33:38.965
Joshua.

33:40.379 --> 33:41.827
- Joshua!
- What?

33:41.827 --> 33:44.172
There's that picture of
the two of you.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.655
Can you get it?

33:47.655 --> 33:49.344
I want Chloe to see it!

33:49.344 --> 33:50.965
Where is it?

33:50.965 --> 33:53.827
It's in the yellow album
with the stack of old photos.

34:04.896 --> 34:07.724
Your dad stopped coming
out here after your mom...

34:11.517 --> 34:12.862
Can't blame him.

34:14.448 --> 34:15.931
It's real hard to take.

34:19.034 --> 34:20.379
It's still tough on him.

34:21.965 --> 34:23.862
We thought she'd just run off.

34:25.034 --> 34:26.379
Never heard from her?

34:26.862 --> 34:27.724
No.

34:28.827 --> 34:29.827
Nothing.

34:30.896 --> 34:32.000
Nothing.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.275
You look just like her.

34:39.689 --> 34:41.620
It's like seeing a ghost.

34:41.620 --> 34:42.896
Found it.

34:46.068 --> 34:46.965
Look.

34:50.448 --> 34:51.655
I remember this.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.034
<i>Chloe.</i>

35:52.000 --> 35:53.689
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

35:53.689 --> 35:55.413
<i>Happy
Fourth of July!</i>

36:14.827 --> 36:16.758
<i>Say Happy
Fourth of July.</i>

36:16.758 --> 36:18.000
<i>Happy
Fourth of July!</i>

36:36.724 --> 36:37.827
<i>Chloe.</i>

36:41.620 --> 36:42.586
Mom?

40:16.758 --> 40:17.896
Hey.

40:23.310 --> 40:24.620
Hey!

42:55.068 --> 42:56.000
<i>Hello?</i>

42:57.310 --> 42:58.275
<i>Chloe?</i>

42:58.275 --> 42:59.068
Dad.

43:00.172 --> 43:01.379
<i>How are you calling me?</i>

43:02.965 --> 43:03.862
<i>Wait.</i>

43:03.862 --> 43:04.965
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

43:10.206 --> 43:11.103
Yeah!

43:13.137 --> 43:14.206
I can hear you.

43:15.793 --> 43:16.896
I think it's working.

43:17.379 --> 43:18.724
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

43:19.793 --> 43:21.000
<i>This is incredible...</i>

43:25.034 --> 43:25.931
Well say something, please!

43:27.103 --> 43:29.482
<i>I'm actually at a
loss for words.</i>

43:30.965 --> 43:32.413
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

43:34.896 --> 43:35.862
<i>I can't believe this is real.</i>

43:37.034 --> 43:39.206
<i>After all this time, you
can hear again.</i>

44:26.344 --> 44:27.551
<i>This is better
than we could have ever expected.</i>

44:28.620 --> 44:32.448
There's activity in 80 percent
of the damaged cells

44:32.448 --> 44:34.379
along with new growth
in the surrounding tissue.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.310
This is remarkable progress

44:37.310 --> 44:39.034
and so quickly, I mean...

44:39.034 --> 44:41.172
the range, the frequencies,
it's...

44:41.172 --> 44:42.448
truly astonishing.

44:43.206 --> 44:44.827
I mean I can hear like...

44:45.413 --> 44:47.034
everything!

44:47.034 --> 44:49.551
My voice has changed
so much and your voice is

44:50.965 --> 44:53.344
different than what
I imagined it to sound like.

44:54.310 --> 44:55.482
In a good way, I hope.

44:55.482 --> 44:58.965
Yes, yes, it's fine,
it's beautiful.

45:00.379 --> 45:01.931
It's just different.

45:03.241 --> 45:05.482
Well, yes, this can be overwhelming.

45:05.482 --> 45:08.103
We have therapists
who can help with the transition.

45:10.517 --> 45:14.000
I can always hear
things in my dreams,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.137
like memories and people,
is that... weird?

45:17.620 --> 45:19.931
No.

45:19.931 --> 45:21.655
No, you were old enough to remember
sounds when you lost your hearing.

45:21.655 --> 45:22.620
Not weird at all.

45:23.482 --> 45:24.551
Okay.

45:26.344 --> 45:27.172
So what now?

45:28.482 --> 45:30.482
Just keep doing what
you're doing.

45:30.482 --> 45:33.344
Keep using the drops
and if anything changes,

45:33.344 --> 45:35.034
anything at all, just...

45:37.034 --> 45:39.206
well, I guess, just call me.

45:41.241 --> 45:42.379
Woah. Yeah.

46:03.034 --> 46:04.206
Excuse me.

47:25.206 --> 47:26.448
Been awhile.

47:28.517 --> 47:30.206
Another one's gone missing.

47:32.068 --> 47:33.034
What do you mean?

47:35.620 --> 47:37.724
Cleaning up after her shift,

47:37.724 --> 47:39.103
never came home.

47:41.379 --> 47:43.413
No car, no body...

47:45.793 --> 47:47.000
No trace.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.206
Flying south for the winter.

47:55.172 --> 47:58.551
They use the earth's magnetic fields
for their migratory patterns.

48:02.241 --> 48:03.241
This place...

48:04.344 --> 48:05.620
it does things to you.

48:09.448 --> 48:10.379
Yeah.

48:19.551 --> 48:20.448
Wait...

48:22.586 --> 48:24.068
could you hear me?

48:38.413 --> 48:39.689
<i>Hey guys!</i>

48:44.310 --> 48:46.793
<i>Hello,
how are you?</i>

48:46.793 --> 48:49.137
<i>How are you?</i>

48:50.103 --> 48:51.689
<i>It smells funny in here.</i>

49:18.344 --> 49:19.413
<i>Chloe?</i>

49:19.413 --> 49:22.413
<i>Sweetie, you got to
go back to bed.</i>

49:56.482 --> 49:57.448
Hello?

50:01.655 --> 50:03.241
Hello? Is somebody there?

50:23.724 --> 50:24.896
Who is this?

55:07.689 --> 55:10.862
[barely audible] <i>Chloe?
Say happy 4th of July.</i>

55:13.137 --> 55:14.724
<i>Say happy 4th of July.</i>

55:15.827 --> 55:17.482
<i>Say happy 4th of July.</i>

55:23.517 --> 55:24.620
<i>Chloe?</i>

55:29.103 --> 55:32.000
<i>Sweetie, you have to go back to bed.</i>

56:25.103 --> 56:26.965
That's our wall
of shame there.

56:31.068 --> 56:33.896
Am I crazy or is that treatment
you're doing working?

56:38.310 --> 56:39.793
Yeah, it is.

56:42.655 --> 56:43.724
Ain't that something!

56:45.000 --> 56:46.551
It's freezing out here!

56:46.551 --> 56:48.034
You want a fisherman's warm up?

56:50.206 --> 56:51.103
Come on.

56:58.344 --> 56:59.241
Here you go.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.827
It's good for what ails you.

57:20.896 --> 57:22.000
So how does it feel?

57:23.172 --> 57:24.862
Hearing after all this time.

57:26.103 --> 57:27.586
Still getting used to it.

57:29.241 --> 57:30.758
I forgot how noisy the world is.

57:32.862 --> 57:34.000
Ain't that the truth.

57:37.689 --> 57:39.103
I saw you in a uniform.

57:39.103 --> 57:40.655
In my dad's old pictures.

57:42.206 --> 57:44.172
I... I didn't know
you were police.

57:44.172 --> 57:44.862
Huh.

57:45.655 --> 57:47.000
Was police.

57:47.275 --> 57:51.655
Some junkie decided
to give me an early retirement.

57:52.724 --> 57:53.862
Medals and all.

57:54.827 --> 57:55.965
Probably for the best.

57:57.793 --> 57:58.689
As a cop you...

57:59.862 --> 58:02.172
see things most people
don't get to see.

58:03.758 --> 58:05.000
I don't miss it really.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.068
We looked for your mom.

58:14.068 --> 58:15.310
It was really hard to do.

58:18.379 --> 58:19.586
Yeah...

58:22.344 --> 58:24.793
That's the last time I remember
really hearing anything.

58:28.862 --> 58:30.241
I still hear her voice.

58:38.793 --> 58:39.827
I...

58:40.965 --> 58:42.310
I wanted to tell you something.

58:44.103 --> 58:45.724
I saw you the other day

58:47.068 --> 58:48.655
with Joshua. -Ellen's

58:48.655 --> 58:50.034
boy.
- Oh.

58:50.034 --> 58:51.724
You might want to be
careful around them.

58:52.689 --> 58:54.000
He's been in some trouble.

58:55.206 --> 58:56.793
What kind of trouble?

58:56.793 --> 58:57.724
Uh...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.379
A few years back, uh...

59:07.448 --> 59:09.000
some pets were going missing.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.103
Dogs, primarily.

59:11.103 --> 59:12.758
All over the outer Cape.

59:14.034 --> 59:14.931
They couldn't prove it, but...

59:16.206 --> 59:18.137
I felt like he had
something to do with it.

59:19.896 --> 59:22.172
Him and his ma,
they're wired funny.

59:24.896 --> 59:26.241
She's had a rough go of it.

59:29.206 --> 59:30.137
Yeah.

59:31.172 --> 59:32.206
Thanks for the heads up.

59:33.172 --> 59:34.758
Hey, don't mention it.

59:42.206 --> 59:43.344
Hank...

59:49.310 --> 59:50.965
Do you have a drill
I can borrow?

1:00:32.068 --> 1:00:33.931
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:00:34.896 --> 1:00:36.482
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:00:36.482 --> 1:00:38.413
<i>Happy Fourth of July!</i>

1:00:41.344 --> 1:00:42.310
<i>Chloe...</i>

1:00:43.172 --> 1:00:45.310
<i>Be careful!</i>

1:03:21.448 --> 1:03:22.586
Hello!

1:04:33.034 --> 1:04:34.000
Hello?

1:04:48.103 --> 1:04:49.310
Is anyone there?

1:04:52.068 --> 1:04:53.310
I'm from next door.

1:05:06.068 --> 1:05:07.137
Hello?

1:07:11.793 --> 1:07:13.068
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:07:34.724 --> 1:07:37.379
<i>Sweetie, you gotta go
back to bed.</i>

1:08:10.724 --> 1:08:13.310
<i>Chloe, say happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:08:31.448 --> 1:08:33.862
<i>You've reached
the voicemail of Dr. Sophia Lynch</i>

1:08:33.862 --> 1:08:36.000
<i>with the Northeast Eye
and Ear Institute.</i>

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000
<i>Please leave a message and I will
return your call during office hours.</i>

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:40.275
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:08:41.931 --> 1:08:45.758
Dr. Lynch, it's Chloe Grayden.

1:08:47.413 --> 1:08:48.724
I know it's late...

1:08:49.551 --> 1:08:50.551
or early even...

1:08:51.517 --> 1:08:53.965
<i>I'm so sorry to call you,</i>

1:08:53.965 --> 1:08:55.758
<i>I just,</i>

1:08:55.758 --> 1:08:58.620
<i>I think something's wrong
with the procedure.</i>

1:08:59.724 --> 1:09:02.482
<i>There's been some bleeding.</i>

1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:06.896
<i>I'm getting ringing in my ears</i>

1:09:08.310 --> 1:09:09.896
<i>and it's getting worse.</i>

1:09:12.793 --> 1:09:15.310
<i>I don't mean to bother you.
I just...</i>

1:09:15.310 --> 1:09:18.655
<i>I needed someone
to talk to about all of this.</i>

1:09:22.758 --> 1:09:24.655
<i>Please just call me
when you can.</i>

1:09:26.655 --> 1:09:27.689
<i>Bye.</i>

1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:40.724
Shit.

1:10:42.482 --> 1:10:43.379
Hello?

1:10:43.379 --> 1:10:45.034
<i>Hey, Chloe.</i>

1:10:45.034 --> 1:10:47.413
<i>Hank told me you came by
to use his power drill.</i>

1:10:47.413 --> 1:10:48.448
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

1:10:48.448 --> 1:10:50.000
Dad, yeah, yeah.

1:10:50.758 --> 1:10:51.827
I'm okay.

1:10:51.827 --> 1:10:53.482
<i>Now why would you
need a drill?</i>

1:11:03.413 --> 1:11:04.448
Hello?

1:11:05.793 --> 1:11:07.034
Dad, I can't hear you.

1:11:12.034 --> 1:11:13.793
<i>Now we talked about
this... you...</i>

1:11:13.793 --> 1:11:15.068
Please calm down, I'm fine.

1:11:21.586 --> 1:11:22.482
Dad?

1:11:27.724 --> 1:11:30.137
<i>Sweetie,
you gotta go back to bed.</i>

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.034
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:12:01.172 --> 1:12:03.448
<i>Chloe, it's Dr. Sophia Lynch.</i>

1:12:09.586 --> 1:12:11.724
Your ears look fine.

1:12:15.655 --> 1:12:18.689
You know, you are the first one
to show positive results.

1:12:20.724 --> 1:12:22.000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:12:23.758 --> 1:12:24.793
Am I the only one?

1:12:24.793 --> 1:12:27.517
So far, but, it's early.

1:12:28.965 --> 1:12:31.517
You are our star subject, though.

1:12:36.586 --> 1:12:37.827
It was working, like...

1:12:39.068 --> 1:12:40.068
really well.

1:12:43.068 --> 1:12:44.034
But I'm...

1:12:45.068 --> 1:12:46.620
hearing things.

1:12:47.724 --> 1:12:49.517
That's good, right? I mean,

1:12:50.620 --> 1:12:52.103
that's what's
supposed to happen.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:58.172
No, like... like things
that aren't there.

1:12:59.758 --> 1:13:01.482
Yeah, no people who have
regained some...

1:13:02.793 --> 1:13:05.413
some hearing through
cochlear implants

1:13:06.206 --> 1:13:08.655
they're often known to have

1:13:08.655 --> 1:13:09.862
auditory hallucinations.

1:13:11.310 --> 1:13:14.103
It can be hard to distinguish between
what's real and what's imagined.

1:13:15.275 --> 1:13:17.896
It could just be symptoms
of sensory overload.

1:13:18.862 --> 1:13:20.517
Sustained loud noises can,

1:13:21.517 --> 1:13:22.862
they can sound like voices.

1:13:27.034 --> 1:13:32.172
Chloe, this is a lot for
anyone to handle.

1:13:34.655 --> 1:13:37.586
It could be helpful to
talk through it.

1:13:41.620 --> 1:13:44.655
Have you reached out to any
of the therapists we
recommended?

1:13:48.793 --> 1:13:49.793
No.

1:13:51.034 --> 1:13:53.000
I'm sorry, I know it's my fault.

1:13:53.896 --> 1:13:55.000
No, no, it's...

1:13:55.689 --> 1:13:56.655
hey.

1:13:57.724 --> 1:14:00.896
How about you go get dressed

1:14:00.896 --> 1:14:02.689
and we get dinner?

1:14:05.310 --> 1:14:07.103
Yeah?

1:14:07.103 --> 1:14:09.965
- Yeah.
- Let's get away from this place
for a bit.

1:14:13.137 --> 1:14:14.862
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.

1:14:19.206 --> 1:14:22.965
I'm realizing I only
really know you from your file.

1:14:24.068 --> 1:14:24.827
What are you up to?

1:14:25.793 --> 1:14:27.206
Are you in school, or...?

1:14:28.862 --> 1:14:29.379
Kinda.

1:14:30.275 --> 1:14:31.172
I took the semester off.

1:14:31.965 --> 1:14:33.827
For your project, actually

1:14:33.827 --> 1:14:35.068
and to help my dad
sell the house.

1:14:36.068 --> 1:14:37.275
Is it just the two of you?

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:39.241
Yeah,

1:14:40.068 --> 1:14:42.034
my mom left when I was eight.

1:14:43.275 --> 1:14:44.551
Disappeared.

1:14:45.275 --> 1:14:47.034
We don't know, actually.

1:14:49.655 --> 1:14:51.655
I was the last
person to see her.

1:14:53.896 --> 1:14:54.862
I mean I was in this...

1:14:56.206 --> 1:14:59.758
coma for six months from
the meningitis.

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.551
And I came out of it and I

1:15:03.344 --> 1:15:06.241
lost my hearing and my mom.

1:15:07.931 --> 1:15:10.620
Then got set back at
school and...

1:15:12.310 --> 1:15:17.655
just like this black
hole it's like...

1:15:19.862 --> 1:15:21.724
just, an invisible weight.

1:15:24.689 --> 1:15:25.793
But,

1:15:26.827 --> 1:15:27.931
it is what it is, right?

1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:32.172
Forces just beyond my control.

1:15:37.379 --> 1:15:39.000
You know I was thinking,

1:15:40.413 --> 1:15:42.275
maybe after this,

1:15:42.275 --> 1:15:43.689
I could like become a counselor

1:15:45.068 --> 1:15:47.310
or something for people
who have the procedure.

1:15:48.758 --> 1:15:52.620
We really have quite a
ways off from that.

1:15:54.034 --> 1:15:56.655
We have the trials,
we have to get approvals...

1:15:56.655 --> 1:15:57.931
- Yeah, no I...
- First...

1:15:57.931 --> 1:15:59.275
No, it's...

1:16:00.689 --> 1:16:01.793
I see.

1:16:03.896 --> 1:16:06.655
Maybe, yeah. Maybe
down the road.

1:16:07.689 --> 1:16:08.862
- Yeah.
- It could be helpful.

1:16:12.034 --> 1:16:13.034
Thank you.

1:16:25.034 --> 1:16:26.310
It sounds like
television static.

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:40.793
You know, I still see album covers
and I see singers, what if the way

1:16:40.793 --> 1:16:43.379
that I imagine their songs is
better than
the way that they actually are, right?

1:16:44.758 --> 1:16:47.206
Oh, no I... I don't
keep up with music

1:16:47.206 --> 1:16:48.965
or trends or anything like that,
I just...

1:16:49.896 --> 1:16:51.862
you know, whatever's on.

1:16:51.862 --> 1:16:52.896
Yeah.

1:16:53.965 --> 1:16:55.034
Yeah, I remember like...

1:16:56.068 --> 1:16:58.000
bits of songs, like fragments.

1:16:58.965 --> 1:17:00.793
In my dreams, usually.

1:17:02.344 --> 1:17:04.724
I mean, I could always
hear my mom though.

1:17:06.448 --> 1:17:10.241
It's like she was the only clear voice
in my head the whole time.

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.000
It's actually... that's...

1:17:13.379 --> 1:17:15.965
that's why I reached out to you
and your project.

1:17:17.896 --> 1:17:21.896
I was never ashamed
of my deafness but I felt like...

1:17:23.310 --> 1:17:26.413
if the volume of the world
got turned back up again

1:17:27.862 --> 1:17:29.241
I wouldn't hear her anymore.

1:17:29.241 --> 1:17:30.310
Like...

1:17:31.379 --> 1:17:32.862
she'd stop calling me back here.

1:17:33.344 --> 1:17:34.379
Hmm...

1:17:38.068 --> 1:17:39.931
Do you still hear her?

1:17:41.172 --> 1:17:42.172
Of course not.

1:17:43.310 --> 1:17:45.000
Your process worked, didn't it?

1:17:50.103 --> 1:17:51.827
Maybe we should get the check.

1:17:52.862 --> 1:17:54.000
Just a minute, hold on.

1:17:56.413 --> 1:17:57.482
Do you know this?

1:18:01.896 --> 1:18:03.931
- No... no I don't.
- I love it.

1:19:06.379 --> 1:19:07.413
Yeah.

1:19:10.137 --> 1:19:11.551
I wonder what they sound like.

1:19:28.931 --> 1:19:31.206
Sorry, it's gotten
a little out of control.

1:19:32.517 --> 1:19:36.000
Oh, it's okay...
there's always tomorrow...

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.034
fresh start.

1:19:43.379 --> 1:19:45.931
It's... getting late.

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:47.517
Yeah.

1:19:48.172 --> 1:19:50.206
You could stay if you want.

1:19:53.344 --> 1:19:57.034
I mean you could sleep
on the couch or not.

1:19:57.931 --> 1:20:01.275
Oh, Chloe, I...

1:20:05.896 --> 1:20:06.827
Don't go.

1:20:11.206 --> 1:20:13.034
I... I
really should...

1:20:14.103 --> 1:20:15.413
I'm sorry.

1:20:18.379 --> 1:20:20.965
You know, there's
something else I need to say.

1:20:24.206 --> 1:20:25.068
You weren't totally
honest with me.

1:20:27.068 --> 1:20:31.103
When your results were so positive,
I followed up on you. I had to.

1:20:32.448 --> 1:20:34.310
What do you mean?

1:20:34.310 --> 1:20:36.931
You should've told me
you were taking antidepressants.

1:20:36.931 --> 1:20:38.206
It could corrupt the study.

1:20:39.448 --> 1:20:42.517
And your mental state with
your mom and...

1:20:42.517 --> 1:20:45.344
that can make everything
so much harder than it already is.

1:20:48.689 --> 1:20:52.172
I don't see how that
matters right now.

1:20:52.172 --> 1:20:55.000
Of course it matters.
It all matters.

1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.931
I have to protect the project.

1:20:57.931 --> 1:21:00.034
You should've been honest with me.

1:21:01.310 --> 1:21:06.275
You are the first person
in the history of human kind

1:21:06.275 --> 1:21:13.344
to have regained your hearing
like this...

1:21:16.103 --> 1:21:17.931
Shoot. Okay, hold on, I'm sorry.

1:21:17.931 --> 1:21:21.413
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean to upset you, I just...

1:21:21.413 --> 1:21:22.344
No, no, I get it, I should...

1:21:23.586 --> 1:21:25.586
I should've told you
about my prescription.

1:21:26.379 --> 1:21:27.689
Oh, my god.

1:21:27.689 --> 1:21:29.344
Sorry, I'm just...

1:21:36.413 --> 1:21:38.206
I think I'm going to puke,
I'm sorry.

1:22:07.206 --> 1:22:08.275
Chloe?

1:22:09.137 --> 1:22:10.137
<i>Come in.</i>

1:22:16.586 --> 1:22:18.379
They just won't stop ringing.

1:22:26.241 --> 1:22:27.724
I really messed this up,
didn't I?

1:22:59.586 --> 1:23:00.724
Shit.

1:23:26.448 --> 1:23:27.655
Dr. Lynch?

1:26:03.827 --> 1:26:04.827
Joshua?

1:26:18.689 --> 1:26:19.793
Joshua?

1:27:39.517 --> 1:27:40.758
Saw your car.

1:27:43.655 --> 1:27:44.310
What is all this?

1:27:45.068 --> 1:27:47.034
I knew it, you can hear.

1:27:49.344 --> 1:27:51.448
- It's not like that.
- Have you been faking?

1:27:53.448 --> 1:27:54.551
You've been watching me.

1:27:55.517 --> 1:27:56.862
You're the one next door.

1:27:56.862 --> 1:27:58.551
We take care of that house.

1:27:59.689 --> 1:28:01.517
I heard you throwing a party.

1:28:02.758 --> 1:28:04.448
- You kept me up all night.
- Wait, what?

1:28:04.448 --> 1:28:06.689
- I heard you, okay?
- Wait, what are you talking about,

1:28:06.689 --> 1:28:07.586
you heard a party?

1:28:08.896 --> 1:28:10.586
No one's been over there
except for me.

1:28:14.068 --> 1:28:16.827
Okay. I'm not stupid,
I'm not crazy,

1:28:16.827 --> 1:28:18.413
stop this shit!

1:28:18.413 --> 1:28:19.482
Wait.

1:28:22.620 --> 1:28:23.931
I saw something

1:28:25.586 --> 1:28:26.586
at your dad's
cottage months ago.

1:28:28.655 --> 1:28:31.482
That's why I've been watching it,
to try to figure out what's
there.

1:28:32.862 --> 1:28:34.862
I mean I thought I was
seeing things,

1:28:34.862 --> 1:28:37.034
hearing things and then
you showed up.

1:28:40.965 --> 1:28:42.379
They're vibrations. Frequencies.

1:28:43.965 --> 1:28:47.068
All around us, magnetic fields,
things that we can't see or hear.

1:28:50.655 --> 1:28:51.586
But you can.

1:28:57.551 --> 1:28:59.000
It's a spirit world.

1:29:16.448 --> 1:29:17.758
This is an ultrasound.

1:29:19.551 --> 1:29:22.379
It's been adjusted to pick up
frequencies beyond our senses.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:24.034
Listen.

1:29:26.448 --> 1:29:27.793
What are you hearing right now?

1:29:29.862 --> 1:29:31.103
Nothing.

1:29:32.827 --> 1:29:34.379
Why did you come back here?

1:29:39.172 --> 1:29:40.896
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:29:45.034 --> 1:29:47.482
It wasn't a choice.
Something called you here...

1:29:48.827 --> 1:29:50.586
- Your mother.
- Stop it.

1:29:50.586 --> 1:29:52.034
Wait, listen!

1:30:05.551 --> 1:30:06.793
Stop it! Stop!

1:30:06.793 --> 1:30:08.482
- Wait!
- Stop it! Stop!

1:30:08.482 --> 1:30:10.551
- Stop! Stop! It's just fucking
noise!
- Wait, just...

1:30:10.551 --> 1:30:13.068
If I see you over at my house again
I'm calling the police.

1:30:13.068 --> 1:30:14.068
Don't be like this.

1:30:15.103 --> 1:30:16.724
Can't you see? Don't fight it!

1:30:16.724 --> 1:30:18.517
You stay away from me.

1:30:19.172 --> 1:30:21.758
Stay away from my house, please.

1:31:07.551 --> 1:31:09.931
<i>You've reached
the voice mail of Dr. Sophia Lynch</i>

1:31:09.931 --> 1:31:12.034
<i>with the Northeast Eye
and Ear Institute.</i>

1:31:12.034 --> 1:31:15.137
<i>Please leave a message and I
will return your call during
office hours.</i>

1:31:15.137 --> 1:31:16.068
<i>Thank you!</i>

1:31:19.068 --> 1:31:20.517
Hi, Dr. Lynch?

1:31:21.275 --> 1:31:23.000
Sophia, sorry.

1:31:24.620 --> 1:31:25.689
It's Chloe.

1:31:28.275 --> 1:31:31.206
What happened to you?
I mean, I woke up and you were gone.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.620
I know I screwed things up...

1:31:38.965 --> 1:31:40.551
I just want to talk it through.

1:31:43.793 --> 1:31:44.827
Make it better.

1:31:47.310 --> 1:31:48.241
Please call me.

1:33:41.379 --> 1:33:42.620
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:33:44.793 --> 1:33:45.724
Mom?

1:33:50.275 --> 1:33:51.724
<i>Chloe, is that you?</i>

1:34:10.068 --> 1:34:11.275
<i>I can see you.</i>

1:34:19.034 --> 1:34:20.000
<i>My god,</i>

1:34:22.758 --> 1:34:24.172
<i>how did you get so big?</i>

1:36:06.965 --> 1:36:08.413
Can you hear me okay?

1:36:11.172 --> 1:36:12.344
Good.

1:36:12.344 --> 1:36:13.896
That's good.

1:36:15.896 --> 1:36:16.896
Your dad...

1:36:18.241 --> 1:36:19.965
he called me, he was concerned
when you didn't pick up your phone.

1:36:21.862 --> 1:36:25.103
With the storm,
he wanted me to come check on you.

1:36:30.241 --> 1:36:31.344
And with good cause.

1:36:35.275 --> 1:36:36.896
You were...

1:36:38.586 --> 1:36:40.172
laying on the floor.

1:36:41.413 --> 1:36:42.827
Your ears were bleeding.

1:36:46.103 --> 1:36:46.931
We should call Dr. Lynch.

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.034
- I have her cell number somewhere.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hey...

1:36:52.344 --> 1:36:54.896
Your doctor is not
coming out here in this weather.

1:36:56.896 --> 1:36:59.482
Don't worry that's the power grid
trying to keep up with the storm.

1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:02.862
I've got a generator.

1:37:04.965 --> 1:37:05.965
I'll go get it going.

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:08.896
Hey,

1:37:12.103 --> 1:37:13.344
you can relax now.

1:37:15.482 --> 1:37:16.586
Have some tea.

1:37:18.517 --> 1:37:20.448
Storm's going to pass
in the morning.

1:37:26.068 --> 1:37:27.206
It's going to be okay.

1:37:29.379 --> 1:37:30.482
I just know it.

1:37:35.206 --> 1:37:36.137
Okay.

1:37:37.275 --> 1:37:38.206
Okay.

1:37:39.482 --> 1:37:40.517
Thank you.

1:40:15.689 --> 1:40:16.724
You're standing!

1:40:18.206 --> 1:40:19.379
That's good.

1:40:22.586 --> 1:40:23.551
Yeah...

1:40:25.310 --> 1:40:27.034
I feel kind of dizzy.

1:40:27.034 --> 1:40:28.172
Come sit down.

1:40:40.724 --> 1:40:41.724
Your feet cold?

1:40:43.793 --> 1:40:46.793
I'm feeling like the chills.

1:40:50.724 --> 1:40:51.758
You're safe here.

1:40:54.068 --> 1:40:55.206
You can relax now.

1:40:59.655 --> 1:41:01.068
I'm going to take care of you.

1:41:09.689 --> 1:41:10.793
Where's your bathroom?

1:41:14.206 --> 1:41:15.241
It's over here.

1:41:49.517 --> 1:41:52.448
You okay in there?

1:41:53.758 --> 1:41:55.551
Yeah...

1:41:55.551 --> 1:41:59.655
just feeling really sick.
Please give me a few minutes.

1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:05.758
That tea's going to make
it all better.

1:42:13.172 --> 1:42:14.172
All better.

1:42:17.413 --> 1:42:18.517
What was that?

1:42:19.344 --> 1:42:20.379
Nothing.

1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:22.724
Dropped something.

1:42:34.413 --> 1:42:35.413
You okay in there?

1:42:37.344 --> 1:42:38.413
No, just... just...

1:42:39.241 --> 1:42:40.275
give me a minute.

1:42:57.482 --> 1:42:58.586
I can hear them.

1:43:06.275 --> 1:43:07.379
Hear what they're saying.

1:43:11.379 --> 1:43:12.379
Do you hear them?

1:43:22.896 --> 1:43:24.241
I hear them.

1:43:29.344 --> 1:43:30.827
The ones I took care of.

1:43:49.413 --> 1:43:50.517
Chloe, you hear me?

1:44:09.482 --> 1:44:11.206
Chloe, what are you
doing in there?

1:44:14.379 --> 1:44:16.896
Open the goddamn door, sweetheart.

1:44:28.379 --> 1:44:29.689
Chloe!

1:44:35.068 --> 1:44:36.275
Chloe!

1:44:42.482 --> 1:44:43.551
Chloe!

1:44:47.068 --> 1:44:48.379
Get back here.

1:44:55.413 --> 1:44:56.517
Chloe!

1:47:03.586 --> 1:47:05.862
Sophia? No...

1:47:07.206 --> 1:47:08.379
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:47:09.862 --> 1:47:11.379
<i>I know you're here.</i>

1:47:22.482 --> 1:47:23.482
<i>Chloe!</i>

1:47:28.689 --> 1:47:30.137
<i>Chloe I know you're out here!</i>

1:47:33.758 --> 1:47:36.103
I'm trying to help you,
I'm sorry!

1:47:41.896 --> 1:47:43.172
You don't understand.

1:47:49.655 --> 1:47:50.586
Chloe.

1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:53.517
Hey!

1:47:59.172 --> 1:48:00.137
Get back here!

1:48:53.275 --> 1:48:54.586
<i>Chloe.</i>

1:49:03.034 --> 1:49:05.034
<i>Sweetie, you gotta go
back to bed.</i>

1:49:22.206 --> 1:49:23.482
<i>Chloe.</i>

1:49:24.655 --> 1:49:25.827
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:49:26.827 --> 1:49:28.103
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:49:29.275 --> 1:49:29.827
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:49:30.793 --> 1:49:32.862
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

1:50:17.724 --> 1:50:20.000
<i>Hello... how are you?</i>

1:50:21.655 --> 1:50:24.896
<i>You know he left for work earlier,
so he'll be back tonight.</i>

1:50:33.965 --> 1:50:35.655
<i>I don't think you
should be here.</i>

1:50:42.689 --> 1:50:44.724
<i>Please, please!</i>

1:51:11.206 --> 1:51:12.344
Where else could you go?

1:51:22.137 --> 1:51:23.827
You're all alone out here.

1:51:28.034 --> 1:51:29.068
Hey, hey,

1:51:30.310 --> 1:51:31.620
it's just me and you now.

1:51:43.827 --> 1:51:45.172
We can talk about this.

1:51:55.793 --> 1:51:57.275
You even sound like her.

1:52:01.862 --> 1:52:02.793
No! No!

1:52:21.896 --> 1:52:23.310
If you could only
hear what I hear.

1:53:24.103 --> 1:53:25.413
Can you hear me?

1:53:26.896 --> 1:53:28.068
Please stop.

1:53:28.965 --> 1:53:29.965
Please stop.

1:53:32.413 --> 1:53:33.310
Stop.

1:53:48.310 --> 1:53:49.379
Chloe?

1:53:51.586 --> 1:53:52.793
Joshua!

1:53:52.793 --> 1:53:53.896
Chloe?

1:53:56.413 --> 1:53:57.310
Chloe!

1:54:05.310 --> 1:54:06.344
Chloe?

1:54:18.931 --> 1:54:21.413
Joshua. Help me out here.

1:54:21.413 --> 1:54:23.551
- What's going on?
- She's having some kind of breakdown,

1:54:23.551 --> 1:54:26.068
- I called an ambulance.
- I heard her scream...

1:55:35.482 --> 1:55:36.896
This is not good for you.

1:55:43.379 --> 1:55:44.586
This is not good at all.

1:56:15.275 --> 1:56:16.206
Joshua.

1:56:17.655 --> 1:56:19.034
Hey! Hey!

1:56:19.034 --> 1:56:21.517
- I'm sorry...
- No, let's go!

1:56:25.172 --> 1:56:27.034
Come on. Come on.

1:56:27.724 --> 1:56:29.034
You go.

1:56:36.655 --> 1:56:37.689
What?

1:56:38.620 --> 1:56:40.586
God damnit!

1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:49.379
Now you fucking hear me?

1:57:24.724 --> 1:57:25.689
What is that?

1:59:06.379 --> 1:59:07.482
Sorry...

1:59:10.275 --> 1:59:11.275
Where's your cell phone?

1:59:12.241 --> 1:59:13.793
We need to call 9-1-1.

1:59:15.172 --> 1:59:16.655
Hey, hey.

1:59:17.793 --> 1:59:19.344
Okay, okay.

1:59:32.275 --> 1:59:33.275
No...

1:59:42.827 --> 1:59:44.103
<i>Chloe?</i>

1:59:46.620 --> 1:59:48.241
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>
