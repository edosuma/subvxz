00:05.606 --> 00:07.439
- Who are you?
- My name is Quinlan,

00:07.441 --> 00:11.276
and you and I have something very
much in common. - What's that?

00:11.278 --> 00:14.847
- We are both
hunting the Master.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.382
-<i> The</i> Occido Lumen.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.951
<i> Somewhere in here is the key</i>

00:18.953 --> 00:21.320
<i> to the Master's demise.</i>
<i> I will use</i>

00:21.322 --> 00:23.122
<i> the book to end this plague.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.657
- Abraham, how ironic

00:25.659 --> 00:27.459
that our duel should end
not with a fight,

00:27.461 --> 00:30.029
but with a simple
transaction in gold.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.065
- Both of you can bid it out. The
man with the deepest pocket wins.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.235
I guess this is yours, old man.
Congratulations.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.738
-<i> It seems Eldritch Palmer</i>
<i> would rather I have the book</i>

00:39.740 --> 00:42.341
than let it fall into
the hands of the Master.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.511
(applause)
- You folks are lucky.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.913
<i> You're on the last train out.</i>

- We've derailed.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.756
Zack!

00:57.758 --> 00:58.891
- Stop!

00:58.893 --> 01:01.093
- Argh! Ah!

01:01.095 --> 01:03.662
Zack!

01:05.166 --> 01:09.368
- Nora.
- She took him away with her.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.236
Don't!
- Nora.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.838
- It's done.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.942
(man screaming)

01:16.944 --> 01:20.345
- Zack is alive.
We want the<i> Lumen.</i>

01:20.347 --> 01:22.014
You have a choice
to make:

01:22.016 --> 01:25.284
the<i> Lumen</i> or Zack.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.256
- (man): Yeah. Can we get
some more of that culture

01:31.258 --> 01:33.625

(creature growling)

01:52.213 --> 01:55.681

02:14.602 --> 02:16.768
- Just make sure there's
no trace of the residue in it.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.770
- Yes, Doctor.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.340
- (man): Here are the reports.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.809
- Eight the hard way.
My lucky number.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.811
- I got a good feeling
about this batch.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.779
- I'll believe it
if you will.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.816
- Well, no one ever won a Nobel
without taking a risk.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.253
Using polio against
glioblastomas? That was one hell

02:34.255 --> 02:36.588
of a gamble. It paid off.
- Yeah, we're not winning

02:36.590 --> 02:38.991
a Nobel. We'll be lucky
if we don't end up in jail.

02:40.995 --> 02:43.362
(indistinct conversations)
(machine beeping regularly)

02:45.299 --> 02:47.866

- OK.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.968
The time is 03:00.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.005

Now, 78.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.721

- Keep an eye

03:09.723 --> 03:11.557

03:11.559 --> 03:14.960

03:14.962 --> 03:17.196

03:19.200 --> 03:21.733
- Shit! She's spiking.
- Code Red!

03:21.735 --> 03:24.169
- We need an APAP IV in here,
stat! We've gotta get

03:24.171 --> 03:26.138

- Uh-uh.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.857
- What floor
is his place on?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.326
- 42nd.

really accomplish?

15:26.693 --> 15:30.028

Yeah, big wins.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.135
Much of this is written
in puzzles

22:51.137 --> 22:55.039
and metaphor. Such as this one:
"Those who heard

22:55.041 --> 22:57.074
"the silent voice of the Master

22:57.076 --> 22:59.076
fell dumbstruck."

22:59.078 --> 23:02.046
- "Silent voice"?
Maybe that's like

23:02.048 --> 23:05.316
the weird hum
that took out the SEALs.

23:05.318 --> 23:07.385
- What? What hum?

23:07.387 --> 23:10.421
- It's hard to explain.
When I was down--

23:10.423 --> 23:12.890
- By definition,
a hum is not silent.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.692
But bottom line,
is there anything in here

23:14.694 --> 23:16.494
that tells us
how to destroy the Master?

23:16.496 --> 23:19.397
- Not with clarity, but
it does mention his destruction

23:19.399 --> 23:22.199
in several places.
Well, for example:

23:22.201 --> 23:25.369
"When the Face of God
shineth upon him,

23:25.371 --> 23:27.738
his essence is destroyed."

23:27.740 --> 23:32.176
- Good. All we have to do
is find the face of God.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.845
- You missing
the metaphor there, Doc?

23:34.847 --> 23:38.115
- Three weeks ago, you didn't
believe<i> strigoi</i> existed,

23:38.117 --> 23:41.719
because I didn't explain them in
scientific terms. How is this different?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.220

23:46.292 --> 23:48.793

sounds like they're talking about sunlight.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.468

23:58.638 --> 24:01.439

would have, uh--
- Does it say that in the<i> Lumen?</i>

24:04.277 --> 24:06.877
- No. In fact, it states

24:06.879 --> 24:08.813
that this event
must take place

24:08.815 --> 24:12.216

24:33.739 --> 24:35.573

to extraordinary lengths

24:38.277 --> 24:40.911
to keep the<i> Lumen</i>
out of our hands.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.314

it's valuable.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.171
- There's nothing random
about it.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.108
You want to know what caused
this plague? Overpopulation.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.410
It was only a matter of time
before a virus mutated

29:06.412 --> 29:08.512
into something that would
take out the human race.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.349
If you ask me...

29:14.253 --> 29:16.754
...we deserved it.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.522
(clinking noise)
- You hear that?

29:18.524 --> 29:22.059
- Someone's here.
- Check.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.862
Come on.

29:24.864 --> 29:28.532
(footsteps)

29:32.138 --> 29:34.404
Jesus, Dutch!

29:34.406 --> 29:36.473
You scared
the shit out of us!

29:38.611 --> 29:40.944
You OK?

29:40.946 --> 29:43.480
Glad to see you made it back.
- No thanks to you.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.550
- Was I supposed to do? Die with you?
- Do I look dead?!

29:46.552 --> 29:48.318
(distant gunfire)

29:53.058 --> 29:56.727
- What are you doing, Dutch?
- Taking my fair share.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.665
Hold still. Come here.
- Stop screwing around.

30:01.667 --> 30:05.102
Look, I know you're pissed,
but this isn't cool.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.970
You don't see shit!

30:06.972 --> 30:08.839
(squelching sounds)
- Oh my God!

30:08.841 --> 30:11.041
- Oh, Christ!
- No!

30:12.311 --> 30:14.144
Oh no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

30:14.146 --> 30:16.180
This can't happen to me!
- What should we do?

30:16.182 --> 30:19.449
- The only cure is "headectomy." -
You want us to cut off his head?!

30:19.451 --> 30:22.186
- If you don't, he'll turn
and he'll come after you.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.788
But I'm not gonna do it.
He's your problem.

30:24.790 --> 30:28.358
- You can't leave us here with him!
- Great. Thanks, Dutch.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.727
She doesn't give
a shit about us.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.200
She only cares about--
(woman screaming)

30:42.007 --> 30:44.007
- There.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.009
It's done.

30:46.011 --> 30:49.279
(woman crying)

30:53.519 --> 30:55.519
- Good?

30:55.521 --> 30:58.055
- It's the first decent food
I've had in weeks.

30:58.057 --> 31:01.024
- This club used to serve food
to its members.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.993
The kitchen is
well provisioned.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.128
- I'll have to come
by here more often.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.867
I've been thinking about what
you said before, about Zack.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.870
Even if the Master
is keeping him alive

31:12.872 --> 31:16.340
just to get to me,
I could still get him back.

31:16.342 --> 31:20.143
- I suppose there's
a small chance. I know

31:20.145 --> 31:21.979
that's not what you want
to hear, but--

31:21.981 --> 31:24.047
- Any chance is better
than no chance.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.749
And if I can
get that opportunity--

31:25.751 --> 31:29.386
- Then you should take it.
But you must beware.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.688
The Master knows your desire.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.391
You could be playing
right into his hands.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.660
- Of course.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.231
- I'm very fond of Zack.
Should an opportunity

31:41.233 --> 31:43.400
to rescue him arise,

31:43.402 --> 31:46.236
I'll do what I can
to assist you.

31:48.173 --> 31:51.742
- I appreciate that.
- And our best hope of creating

31:51.744 --> 31:54.111
that opportunity
is the<i> Lumen.</i>

31:54.113 --> 31:56.947
It will provide me the key
to destroying the Master.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.949
And when I do,

31:58.951 --> 32:01.084
perhaps we can
recover your boy.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.253
(door opening)

32:03.255 --> 32:06.857
- Professor, just got a message
through Faraldo's people.

32:06.859 --> 32:09.259
Rudyard Fonescu wants
to meet with you.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.194
- Who?

32:11.196 --> 32:14.197
- For 40 years he possessed
the<i> Lumen.</i>

32:14.199 --> 32:16.199
Did he say where and when?

32:16.201 --> 32:18.235
- West 15th under the High Line,
an hour.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.438
- Then we should go now.
- I suppose I better--

32:21.440 --> 32:23.640
- No, no. Stay. Help yourself
to some more stew.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.586
- I thought Rudyard Fonescu

32:36.588 --> 32:38.588
took his money and ran.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.924
What's he doing
still kicking around New York?

32:40.926 --> 32:43.493
- Hopefully,
he has further information

32:43.495 --> 32:46.330
about the<i> Lumen</i> to sell.
- Or we could be walking

32:46.332 --> 32:48.131
into an ambush.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.168
Get back!

32:51.170 --> 32:54.104
- (distant woman):
Get out of here! Go!

32:54.106 --> 32:56.306
(vehicle doors closing)

33:09.188 --> 33:10.620
- Put down the gun.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.423
Let's hear
what he has to say.

33:16.829 --> 33:19.129
- Apologies for
the Fonescu ruse,

33:19.131 --> 33:21.598
but I know you wouldn't
come otherwise.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.803
- What do you want, Eldritch?
- I want to strike a deal.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.206
- Go on.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.778
- I am willing to remove
myself from the game,

33:34.780 --> 33:36.813
leave New York,

33:36.815 --> 33:39.983
withdraw all my support
for the Master.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.319
- You'll forgive my disbelief.

33:42.321 --> 33:45.455
- Oh, I am still essential
to the Master.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.191
And there are still
a few critical moves to be made,

33:48.193 --> 33:51.461
which require my participation
if they are to succeed.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.031
If I abandon
the Master,

33:54.033 --> 33:55.866
you will gain

33:55.868 --> 33:57.868
a massive advantage
over him.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.870
For that,

33:59.872 --> 34:01.905
I want something
in return.

34:01.907 --> 34:05.709
- And what would that be?
- The formula.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.578
- What formula?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.115
- For the white.

34:13.519 --> 34:17.354
Abraham, you're a very,
very old man.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.489
There is only one explanation

34:19.491 --> 34:22.526
for your extraordinary vigor.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.494
<i> Strigoi</i> blood.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.164
You've found a way
to refine it, haven't you,

34:27.166 --> 34:29.199
so you can remain human
yet benefit

34:29.201 --> 34:31.201
from its restorative effects.

34:31.203 --> 34:34.004
- That's insane.

34:34.006 --> 34:36.339
- And what if I have?

34:36.341 --> 34:38.675
- Give me the formula;

34:38.677 --> 34:42.345
I will walk away forever
leaving the Master exposed.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.247
You can save this city

34:44.249 --> 34:46.583
and the human race.
Your life's quest

34:46.585 --> 34:49.386
will come
to a successful end.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.388
It costs you nothing.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.690
You have everything to gain.

34:53.692 --> 34:57.194
Do we have a deal?

35:03.902 --> 35:07.771
- I remember another handshake
years ago

35:07.773 --> 35:10.474
in Vienna

35:10.476 --> 35:13.043
and the betrayal
that followed.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.280
- Yes, I betrayed you.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.484
Now, I want
to make amends.

35:20.486 --> 35:24.321
I hope it's not too late
for redemption.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.123
- You may call it redemption,

35:26.125 --> 35:28.425
but I have another word
for it --

35:28.427 --> 35:30.127
treachery.

35:30.129 --> 35:33.597
I have the<i> Lumen</i>
and I have the white.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.465
What do you have?

35:35.467 --> 35:38.635
- I have the power
to alter the outcome.

35:40.072 --> 35:43.707
- You can go to hell, Eldritch,
where you belong.

36:06.031 --> 36:11.001
- So, uh, how long
you been taking that stuff?

36:11.003 --> 36:13.603
<i> Strigoi</i> blood.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.505
- Off and on

36:15.507 --> 36:17.574
for 41 years.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.279
- How'd you figure out a way

36:22.281 --> 36:24.781
to keep it from turning you
full muncher?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.716
- Edvard Frankel,

36:26.718 --> 36:30.187
an old<i> strigoi</i> hunter
I knew in Vienna, taught me

36:30.189 --> 36:32.556
the formula.
It's been handed down

36:32.558 --> 36:36.059
among selected alchemists
since the third century.

36:36.061 --> 36:39.996
- And what? You're gonna live
forever like Quinlan?

36:39.998 --> 36:43.166
- No. The white will extend
my life a few more years,

36:43.168 --> 36:45.368
allow me to continue the fight.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.872
But Palmer's mistaken.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.309
It will not give him
eternal life.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.379
- No need to tell him that.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.315
Better he thinks otherwise.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.283
We certainly can't trust him.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.753
- But we may be able

37:03.755 --> 37:06.456
to manipulate him.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.996
♪♪♪

37:33.118 --> 37:35.418
- I made you some food.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.420
- Cool.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.456
Can you put it
on the table for me?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.625
- Yeah.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.369
You've been reading.
- Not much else to do.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.537
(slow fan noise)
- Would you like me

37:54.539 --> 37:57.207
to read with you?
- Maybe later.

37:57.209 --> 37:59.342
I'm tired.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.046
- It's good to eat.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.127
So, when can I go
to see Dad?

38:18.463 --> 38:21.865
- Soon.
- Your new favorite word.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.470
- I know it is difficult,

38:27.472 --> 38:30.874
but we must be patient.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.181
(sound of beating pulse)

38:44.256 --> 38:46.456
(The sound of the pulse stops.)

38:46.458 --> 38:48.925
(slow fan noise)

38:55.434 --> 38:57.767
- I wanna go to bed.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.769
Good night.

39:01.540 --> 39:05.342
- Good night, my dear one.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.587
(footsteps retreating)

39:24.363 --> 39:26.863
(distant door opening
and closing)

39:59.898 --> 40:02.432
(chain clanking)

40:02.434 --> 40:05.235
(steady thumping)

40:07.272 --> 40:10.707
(squelching)

40:10.709 --> 40:13.276
(steady pumping)

40:17.883 --> 40:19.482
- Mom?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.920
(growling)

40:23.922 --> 40:26.456
(suspenseful music)
(Zack gasping)

40:26.458 --> 40:27.524
- Zack!

40:27.526 --> 40:29.526
(Zack gasping for breath)

40:32.864 --> 40:35.231
(clanking)

40:35.233 --> 40:37.834
(Zack gasping for breath)

40:44.309 --> 40:47.277
(Zack gasping for breath)
- Mom,

40:47.279 --> 40:48.912
I can't breathe.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.548
Help me.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.391
(sound of beating pulse)

41:06.231 --> 41:08.031
No, Mom.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.668
No!

41:14.406 --> 41:16.906
(Zack gasping for breath)

41:22.814 --> 41:24.781
(Zack coughing)

41:24.783 --> 41:27.016
(Zack gasping for breath)

41:28.587 --> 41:30.620
No.

41:30.622 --> 41:33.690
No.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.037
(Zack gradually
breathing easier)

42:17.903 --> 42:19.969
(sighs)

42:48.033 --> 42:50.266
(low buzzing)

42:56.174 --> 42:58.508
(distant siren blaring)

43:03.448 --> 43:05.415
(handle clanking)

43:05.417 --> 43:07.784
- (Quinlan): What did
the Master offer you for it?

43:10.589 --> 43:12.088
- My son.

43:12.090 --> 43:15.291
- He will not keep
his end of the bargain.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.930
- It's the only shot I have.
- There's another option,

43:20.932 --> 43:24.100
which offers far greater
chance of success.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.636
- What's that?

43:26.638 --> 43:28.871
- The<i> Lumen</i> will bring
the Master out of hiding.

43:28.873 --> 43:32.208
When he comes for it,
I'll kill him.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.778
- Why?
- My grievance is personal.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.249
- How do I know you can get
the job done?

43:40.251 --> 43:43.820
- I've been preparing
for this... job

43:43.822 --> 43:45.888
for over a thousand years.

43:45.890 --> 43:48.825
It's not what's in the book
that will destroy him,

43:48.827 --> 43:51.260
but what we do with it.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.329
You turn off

43:53.331 --> 43:55.565
the UV lights,

43:55.567 --> 43:58.568
that lock is child's play
for me.

43:58.570 --> 44:01.404
What do you say,
Dr. Goodweather?

44:01.406 --> 44:04.907
Together we can use the book

44:04.909 --> 44:07.043
to save the world...

44:09.247 --> 44:11.848
...and your son.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.824
