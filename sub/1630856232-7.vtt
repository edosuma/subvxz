00:04.546 --> 00:07.799
We're at the last day
of blinds.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.260
Reba, your first season
on "The Voice."

00:10.301 --> 00:11.761
How does it feel?

00:11.803 --> 00:14.014
I can't believe it is
the last day of the blinds.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.598
Thank y'all so much
for your help.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.766
I appreciate it.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.768
It's been a pleasure.
It's been a blast.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.312
And you have some
amazing singers on your team.
Y'all do, too.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.689
I think this is
the first time in a while

00:22.731 --> 00:26.693
I've seen every coach
has got a potential winner.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.112
I think John has five winners
on his team. [ Laughs ]

00:29.154 --> 00:31.072
I was gonna say,
some a few winners. Yeah.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.282
We're not gonna go down
easy, though.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.742
Only one person's
gonna win.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.119
And literally it could be
anybody on anybody's team.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.746
Can't wait
for the battles.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.664
Wait, what should I wear, Niall?
I'm trying to figure that out.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.042
Um, I think you should
wear all beige.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.501
[ Laughter ]

00:43.543 --> 00:45.211
John: Let's go get our last
artists. Let's go.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.255
Let's do it.
Meow, meow, meow!

00:51.301 --> 00:53.720
Hey, don't click off yet.
Let him say --

00:53.762 --> 00:55.680
Don't click anything.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.683
Woman: Recording stopped.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.561
Producer: It's okay.
I stopped recording.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.356
Sometimes it's good
to just go with the flow

01:04.397 --> 01:06.191
and just see what happens.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.151
Oh, Michael?
Michael?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.694
Don't pick up
that cymbal stand.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.154
Yay!
Okay.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.614
I think
we should be good now.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.200
My name is Huntley,
and these are my kids.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.951
This is Stella,
and this is Michael.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.454
And they are literally
the light of my life.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.997
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]

01:21.039 --> 01:23.208
Watch that trash can.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.126
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:25.168 --> 01:26.670
Raising two kids
can be difficult.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.921
Michael, look.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.756
But they're my world.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.258
Michael's rolling
the wrong way.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.468
I co-parent.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.428
I have them one week on,
one week off.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.930
You ready to start the day?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.556
I think
sissy night-night.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.225
Oh, sissy's
still night-night?

01:40.266 --> 01:41.559
I just want to show them
how to love

01:41.601 --> 01:43.269
and really chase their dreams.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.854
I didn't have that.

01:44.896 --> 01:48.775
My dad kind of disappeared
when I was like 8 years old.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.861
And when I found music,
I feel like I found my place.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.780
I've been singing my whole life.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.784
But when I was 14, my buddy
Robert heard me singing a song,

01:57.826 --> 01:59.285
and he was like, "What?!"

01:59.327 --> 02:01.204
He was like,
"Dude, we're starting a band."

02:01.246 --> 02:03.456
I started in a metal band.
I was a screamer.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.291
And then I found
the acoustic guitar,

02:05.333 --> 02:07.460
and that's when I uprooted
to Nashville.

02:07.502 --> 02:11.131
I was 19 years old, not knowing
what I was getting into.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.799
I tried for so long,

02:12.841 --> 02:15.635
but living paycheck to paycheck
just wasn't cutting it for me,

02:15.677 --> 02:17.971
and I went back to Virginia.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.640
I came back feeling defeated,

02:20.682 --> 02:24.144
but I had a daughter,
and it changed my whole life.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.520
[ Laughs ]

02:25.562 --> 02:27.564
As soon as my daughter was born,

02:27.605 --> 02:30.483
providing for my family
was my number-one goal.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.570
I play three to five shows
a week now,

02:33.611 --> 02:36.531
and during the day,
I'm a booking agent.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.159
I have to make calls to venues.
I have to do scheduling.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.827
I have to deal
with cancellations.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.287
I didn't have that.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.331
And that's what kind of
drove me to get in that field.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.167
It does give me
a lot of gratification

02:47.208 --> 02:48.501
that I'm taking care
of the artists.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.170
Whoa!
Whoa!

02:50.211 --> 02:52.839
But I'm ready for a opportunity
to show the world my music.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.341
Oh, it's your crush.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.885
Dad, stop! I'm on TV!

02:56.926 --> 02:59.596
Alright, this is my girl,
and I'm her biggest fan.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.056
Well,
let's see if she turns.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.516
If she doesn't,
that's not your number-one fan.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.186
No, I'm her number-one fan,
even if she doesn't turn.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.022
I think all four.
Four is our sign.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.357
Let's do it.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.027
I'm so thrilled that
my daughter is here

03:14.069 --> 03:15.403
to follow this dream
with me.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.863
I'm excited to see Reba.

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
If we can go up there,

03:17.947 --> 03:20.658
I would be pleasure
to meet Reba.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.662
Huntley: And I know my son's at
home right now, cheering me on.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.707
And a lot of the times, I feel
selfish following this dream,

03:27.749 --> 03:30.919
and I just want
to accomplish this for us.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.464
I think the scariest thing is
just not getting chairs turned

03:34.506 --> 03:36.299
and having to face
my daughter afterwards.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.717
There's Daddy.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.095
But I know she's proud
that I'm here in general.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.596
He looks cool.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.890
I've just gotten
a lot of no's,

03:43.932 --> 03:48.061
and it would be really good for
once in my life to get a yes.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.562
This is fun.

like I was Elvis

listened to you,

of an English singer

called James Morrison.

like the Chris Stapleton thing,

that's a tone
that comes naturally.

you should pick me

very comfortable.

what other kind of songs

that you would do
on this show.

of Bradley from Sublime.

that you have that rasp.

I get that a lot.
Like, to hear you
do something like that,

I'd be curious to see
how you would do that.

I don't know
if Stella's deciding

08:53.742 --> 08:55.035
or if Huntley's deciding,

08:55.076 --> 08:57.537
but we've got to pick
a coach.

Does she have a say
in this decision?

for making the perfect choice.

Aww!

He's so in control,
so dynamic,

so much character to his voice.

This guy is a really exciting
prospect in this competition.

Thanks for picking me.

she said.

I appreciate it.
You've got very nice eyes.

that dance at the halftime.

of gigs like that.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.613
I'm gonna go with John.
Yes!

17:51.654 --> 17:52.530
Whoo!

17:52.572 --> 17:53.948
I love you, Reba.
I love you.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.159
Good choice. Good choice.
I love you so much.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.869
Oh, my gosh! Yes!

17:57.911 --> 17:59.704
John: Azán has great tone.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.914
She has great power.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.207
She has great control,

18:02.248 --> 18:04.584
and she just has
a really enjoyable voice.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.211
And we're gonna pick
some great songs

18:06.252 --> 18:07.671
that will bring out
the best in her voice.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.172
Mwah! Welcome.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.591
I only have one last spot.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.176
I'm looking
for something special.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.387
I want to feel it.
I want to be moved.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.932
And I'm trying to fill out
my team with all-stars.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.226
We're here!

18:22.060 --> 18:24.813

Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.665
**

18:43.707 --> 18:45.625
* When I was a young boy
living in the city *

18:45.667 --> 18:47.544
* All I did was run, run,
run, run, run *

18:47.585 --> 18:50.839
I'm Eli Ward, I'm 21,
and I'm from Waterloo, Illinois.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.175
I'm a Big Ten D1 student athlete
at University of Iowa,

18:54.217 --> 18:55.844
and I run track
and cross country.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.973
You have to be dedicated.
Grueling is an understatement.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.182
* Run, run, run *

19:01.224 --> 19:04.060
So, I was sticking around
75 miles a week.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.437
* Run, run, run *

19:05.478 --> 19:09.441
I think my fastest mile time
is a 4:12.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.693
It was always a dream of mine
to be a D1 runner,

19:11.735 --> 19:14.112
but it was also a dream
to chase the musician dream.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.197
And going to college,
it wasn't very feasible

19:16.239 --> 19:17.365
for me to try and do both.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.825
* Run, run, run *

19:18.867 --> 19:21.327
So, I actually decided
that I would start

19:21.369 --> 19:22.871
going down the path
of music instead.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.206
That's who won it last year,
isn't it?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.292
Yeah, that's Gina
and Niall.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.877
I want a picture up here
with Niall.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.046
Do you want a big picture, or
do you want a little small one?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.297
As long as I get a picture,

19:32.339 --> 19:35.050
I don't really care
what size it is.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.385
I picked up running from my dad,

19:37.427 --> 19:39.679
and then the music side
is definitely my mom.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.432
She put me into piano lessons
when I was this tall,

19:42.474 --> 19:43.892
and I am forever thankful.

19:43.933 --> 19:48.313
Eli is unbelievably driven
in anything he does.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.774
He sets a goal,
he goes for it.

19:51.775 --> 19:55.737
At school, as far as music goes,
I write, record, produce.

19:55.779 --> 19:58.406
Right now,
I have three singles out,

19:58.448 --> 19:59.783
and when I'm home
for the summers,

19:59.824 --> 20:02.744
I love to play those
every time I'm gigging

20:02.786 --> 20:06.456
to see how they fare
in different crowds.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.291
I have three.
Don't I have three?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.584
Three?
Yeah.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.252
You got one, John?
One more?
Yeah.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.671
I need one.
You need one.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.798
We'll get there.
We will get there.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.926
Man: Ladies and gentlemen, our
next artist is entering now.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.595
Eli: Leaving running for music
my final year at college

20:20.637 --> 20:22.764
is definitely not
the easiest decision,

20:22.806 --> 20:25.016
but I think it's absolutely
the right choice.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.478
And I think a chair turn would
even validate that further.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.855
Shh!
No, no, no, no.

Sorry. That was --
That was crazy.

I totally understand.
What's your name?

My name is Eli Ward.
I'm 21.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.674
Well, Eli,
that was really wonderful.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.677
I liked your song that you sang,
and it's totally different

22:23.718 --> 22:26.137
than anybody else
I've got on my team.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.724
I love your voice.
It's a different tone.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.810
I love your approach
to everything.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.977
It really appealed to me.

I turned around,

to have you on my team,

out of pure excitement,
as I'm sure.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.560

It's not easy
to come out here

23:13.601 --> 23:15.395

and take on a song.

I mean, that -- that tells me
that you have so much potential.

As soon as I turned,
I could hear, like,

23:35.582 --> 23:38.251
the whole performance went to
another place, and I was like --

23:38.293 --> 23:40.211
Yeah, it was...
..."What happened to him?
Like, he was like..."

You were so solid.
You know what I'm saying?

23:42.505 --> 23:44.966

But that's okay because
you already got two turns,

23:45.008 --> 23:46.301

to be coached,

23:46.343 --> 23:48.428

to do that.

situation when I was your age,

would have happened to me?

when Gwen turned

excited you were.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.627

something like that.

with that moment again

that someone turned for you.

I got, like, a new setup.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.889
I was learning how
to make my own demos,

27:19.931 --> 27:21.516
and I started writing
what I wanted to write.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.853
And for the first time,
I was like [exhales deeply]

27:24.894 --> 27:26.646
It was like a weight
lifted off my shoulder.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.315
* Let me see that sunshine *

27:29.357 --> 27:32.777
Since going independent,
I've been able to release music,

27:32.819 --> 27:34.029
regardless of what I feel like

27:34.070 --> 27:35.780
somebody is gonna
think about it.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.949
And "The Voice" is
such a great platform

27:37.991 --> 27:40.785
to be able to put
all of that aside.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.705
I'm feeling like
I have an identity again,

27:43.747 --> 27:45.040
and I feel good.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.668
I feel like I'm like
a singer-songwriter-y...

27:48.710 --> 27:51.421
I want to call it
"coffee shop pop."

27:51.463 --> 27:52.589
That might not be a genre.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.299
She's got
such a wide range.

27:54.341 --> 27:56.384
She's got all these
different tones

27:56.426 --> 27:57.844
within each of her songs.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.221
And I think this opportunity
is almost a reward

28:00.263 --> 28:02.766
for all the hard work
that she's put in.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.893
Music is a really
hard industry to be in,

28:04.934 --> 28:09.064
and I have the support system
that a lot of people don't get.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.607
And I'm very, very lucky.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.484
Don't get jealous
if I'm standing next to Niall,

28:12.525 --> 28:16.404
and, you know, I happen to have
put my arm around him.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.031
I can live with that.

28:18.073 --> 28:21.076
This is a huge opportunity,
and I'm gonna be nervous.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.410
I already know I am.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.330

I am from Roswell, Georgia,

30:31.039 --> 30:32.916
but I live
in Nashville, Tennessee.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.751
Great. Great.

30:34.793 --> 30:37.712
Well, I'm terribly sorry
I didn't turn around for you.
That's okay.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.214
I've got one slot left,

30:39.255 --> 30:42.133
so I'm just, you know,
picking and choosing.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.219
But I heard a little bit
of pitch problems

30:44.260 --> 30:45.470
every once in a while

30:45.512 --> 30:47.389
that I was a little
concerned with.

Like Reba, I only have
one slot left on my team.

30:56.189 --> 30:58.483
And also, I was waiting
for the chorus to come in

30:58.525 --> 31:01.403
because I know how big
of a chorus that song has.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.029
I thought you
pretty much nailed it.

31:03.071 --> 31:05.115
You got two wonderful people
who want to coach you.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.658

from here.

Hi, Brailey.
Hi, Gwen.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.163
I really love
your voice.

31:12.205 --> 31:14.124
I think you have
a lot of texture,

31:14.165 --> 31:16.960
and I felt like there
were some weird choices

31:17.002 --> 31:18.044
for some of the notes,

31:18.086 --> 31:20.422
but then other times
it was like,

31:20.463 --> 31:23.091
"Wow, that girl has
so much character in her voice

31:23.133 --> 31:25.677
and personality, and she's
singing from her heart."
Thank you.

31:25.719 --> 31:28.221
And I think that that's
the whole point of this show

31:28.263 --> 31:31.558
is you get
a great coach, right,

31:31.599 --> 31:33.143
that's super into you,

31:33.184 --> 31:35.311
that could be
your cheerleader,

31:35.353 --> 31:37.731
that can help you
with all of those decisions.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.816
Right?

31:39.858 --> 31:44.946
And I'm the obvious choice
for you on this show.
Yes.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.239

31:46.281 --> 31:48.867
this is my seventh season
on this show.

I love being here,

31:50.368 --> 31:52.287
just to work with people
like you that are so gifted

31:52.328 --> 31:53.621
that just need
a little zhuzh

31:53.663 --> 31:55.457
here and there
to bounce off of,

31:55.498 --> 31:57.459
to just get to the next level,
you know?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.127

to be your coach.

[ Laughs ]

32:07.302 --> 32:08.803
The issue with picking
a song that big

32:08.845 --> 32:11.306
is you were so --

32:11.348 --> 32:13.892
you thought
about the word "makes"...

32:13.933 --> 32:15.393
How did you know?
[ Laughs ]

32:15.435 --> 32:18.021
...so much that sometimes then
the rest of the sentence

32:18.063 --> 32:20.482
was forgotten about a little bit
because you were just like,

32:20.523 --> 32:22.567
"I need to hit that first note
in the chorus."

32:22.609 --> 32:24.235

audition nerves.

have that issue

Oh, I don't know
about that.

32:40.085 --> 32:43.088
My favorite ones are people
who jump at an opportunity

32:43.129 --> 32:45.173
to make a moment
in their first audition.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.342
And to pick a Sheryl Crow song,
it's huge.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.219
Like, that's a --
that's a big moment.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.222

to get to work with you.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.598

32:53.640 --> 32:55.392
I could see that
when you're talking to Niall,

32:55.433 --> 32:57.310
you're nervous,
like, because he's cute

32:57.352 --> 32:59.938
and he has, like,
an Irish, like, accent.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.107
Like,
you don't want a coach

33:02.148 --> 33:04.275

like, distracted.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.236

he says the word "love,"

36:13.506 --> 36:15.175
Oh, my God!
Exciting!

36:15.216 --> 36:17.135
Let's go!
Let's go!

36:18.928 --> 36:21.056
Colby: All my life,
I just wanted to be a doctor.

36:21.097 --> 36:23.266
My main goal was always
wanting to help people.

36:23.308 --> 36:27.354
But if I could change lives
through the songs that I write,

36:27.395 --> 36:28.855
that's what I would want to do.

36:28.897 --> 36:31.483
"The Voice" can make
that possible for me.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.734
Daly:
Good luck, everybody.

Hi, how are you?

* You found *

* Somebody else *

36:55.048 --> 36:57.967
* And at first *

36:58.009 --> 37:00.095
* I thought *

37:00.136 --> 37:04.349
* It was a li-i-i-i-i-e *

37:04.391 --> 37:06.643

with somebody else *

37:26.246 --> 37:27.956
She's thinking about it.
* Our love has gone cold *

Ooh, come on, Reba.
* You're entwining your soul *

37:31.376 --> 37:35.130
* With somebody else *

37:35.171 --> 37:37.048

through your phone *

with somebody else *

Hello. What is your name,
and where are you from?

38:26.598 --> 38:27.849
Hi, my name is Colby Cobb.

38:27.891 --> 38:29.809
I'm 19,
and I'm from Centre, Alabama.

38:29.851 --> 38:33.980
You have one of my favorite
voices I've heard this season.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.566
And I know that sounds weird
'cause I didn't turn around,

38:36.608 --> 38:39.903
but your tone and your natural
style and instinct

38:39.944 --> 38:42.447
is just so,
so pretty and beautiful.

38:42.489 --> 38:45.617
And I just feel that you just
need to focus on the tuning.

38:45.658 --> 38:48.036
So, I just want to encourage you
to just come back here.

38:48.078 --> 38:51.790
I also think that
with a song like this,

38:51.831 --> 38:53.833
it's obviously like
a pulse-y kind of groove.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.877
It's very easy
when something's so chilled

38:55.919 --> 38:57.462
and you're strumming
along slowly

38:57.504 --> 38:58.797
to sit so far
behind the beat

38:58.838 --> 39:00.590
that you can't keep up
with the pitch.

39:00.632 --> 39:03.009
Just make sure
you get there and attack,

39:03.051 --> 39:04.678
like the way Matty Healy
does in that song.

39:04.719 --> 39:07.889
He's very * I don't want
your body, but... *

39:07.931 --> 39:10.767
You know, like, it's very --
it's not dreamy.

39:10.809 --> 39:12.894
It's attacking, even though
it's still pulsing along.

39:12.936 --> 39:14.813
And I think if you just keep
an eye on that.

39:14.854 --> 39:17.315
Gwen's right.
Please come back.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.858
I wish everybody
could make it

39:18.900 --> 39:22.737
'cause you have such
courage and ambition.

39:22.779 --> 39:25.031
And for you to be up here
on this stage,

39:25.073 --> 39:26.616
millions of people
are going to see you

39:26.658 --> 39:27.826
and they're
gonna hear you

39:27.867 --> 39:29.577
and love you,
just like we love you.

39:29.619 --> 39:31.079
Please come back again.

39:31.121 --> 39:33.331
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

I loved his voice.

Reba: Oh, that hurts
my heart.
Niall: Hmm?

39:43.466 --> 39:44.634
That hurts my heart.

39:44.676 --> 39:46.011
Yeah, 'cause he was
actually good.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.971
With Colby,
it was unfortunate,

39:48.013 --> 39:49.472
and I hate
that part of the show.

39:49.514 --> 39:51.099
There's got to be no's,
of course.

39:51.141 --> 39:54.102
Everybody can't make it through,
but he had a great voice.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.646
It just didn't fit
with the rest of my team.

39:56.688 --> 39:57.981
I haven't turned in a while.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.816
I'm still waiting
on that perfect person

that's gonna fit my team,
round it out.

40:02.610 --> 40:04.988
He'll get better.
His voice is lovely.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.116
Okay, two more for me,
right?

40:08.158 --> 40:09.951
You need two.
We need one.

Here you go.

40:22.464 --> 40:23.840
It is a very small town.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.092
So, right now,
I'm just playing and singing

40:26.134 --> 40:29.679
at special events,
birthday parties, weddings.

40:29.721 --> 40:32.140
If Reba McEntire turns,

40:32.182 --> 40:35.018
that would mean the world
to me and my mom.

40:35.060 --> 40:40.482
My mom and I are definitely
the musical ones in my family.

40:40.523 --> 40:41.983
For my blind audition,

40:42.025 --> 40:45.236
I'm singing "I Look to You"
by Whitney Houston.

40:45.278 --> 40:48.323
Every time it came on the radio,
my mom would tell me,

40:48.365 --> 40:50.825
"Dylan, I want you
to sing it at my funeral."

40:50.867 --> 40:52.827
I would just say, "I'll try."

40:52.869 --> 40:56.164
I never in a million years
would have dreamed

40:56.206 --> 40:57.499
that would have happened.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.334
I never thought
I would lose my mom.

About a year ago, she woke up,
couldn't catch her breath,

41:07.926 --> 41:11.179
and drove herself
to the hospital.

41:11.221 --> 41:12.639
As soon as she walked in,

41:12.681 --> 41:15.558
hospital staff said
she was blue.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.852
She just collapsed.

41:17.894 --> 41:20.897
My mom was 47 years old.

41:20.939 --> 41:24.192
It was a blockage in her heart.

41:24.234 --> 41:26.027
I walked into the room,

41:26.069 --> 41:31.157
and I didn't know
she was gone at the time.

41:33.785 --> 41:39.082
I thought maybe she was, um,
asleep.

41:42.002 --> 41:46.089
I just wish
we could have said goodbye.

41:47.215 --> 41:50.093
We were shocked.
Our world just stopped.

41:50.135 --> 41:53.179
She did everything
for all of us.

Our world
is still stopped.

41:55.390 --> 41:56.725
But this
is keeping us going.

41:56.766 --> 42:00.186
She would be jumping
up and down

42:00.228 --> 42:03.398
if she knew
I was on "The Voice."

42:03.440 --> 42:06.109
This was her dream for me.

I have not sang this song
since my mom's funeral.

as a second chance.

It feels like the emotion of
the song is really real to you.

46:36.171 --> 46:39.132
When I saw you all turn around,
I saw my mom.

46:39.174 --> 46:41.509
Oh.
She passed back in October,

46:41.551 --> 46:44.179
and she wanted me
to sing it at her funeral.

46:44.220 --> 46:45.680
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness.

46:45.722 --> 46:47.057
So I did it.
I tried.

46:47.098 --> 46:49.434
But I couldn't
make it through it.

46:49.476 --> 46:50.518
I can believe that.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.520
So, this was the best
second chance.

46:52.562 --> 46:54.773
I just made her so proud.

46:54.814 --> 46:56.733
Wow.

Well, and now
I'm crying, so...

47:01.071 --> 47:03.198
Me, too.
I'm literally crying.

47:03.239 --> 47:05.909
This was -- This was her dream
before it was mine.

47:05.950 --> 47:08.536
Well,
that's very moving.

47:08.578 --> 47:11.122
We're all very grateful
that we get to do this show

47:11.164 --> 47:13.416
and we get to meet
people like you.

47:13.458 --> 47:17.212
And we get to give you this
opportunity to perform this song

47:17.253 --> 47:18.838
in tribute to your mother.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.131
And we all felt it, too.

47:20.173 --> 47:23.051
And I know your mother
is proud of you, okay?

the opportunity to go

to Nashville [voice breaking]
to, uh, meet with some folks,

47:33.269 --> 47:35.146
Mama took me,
and I kept saying,

47:35.188 --> 47:36.898
"Well, let's pull over here.
Let's pull over here."

47:36.940 --> 47:39.484
And finally she said, "Reba,
if you don't want to do this,

47:39.526 --> 47:41.861
let's turn around
and go back home.

47:41.903 --> 47:43.530
But let me
tell you something.

47:43.571 --> 47:47.909
If you do this, I'll be living
my dreams through you."

47:47.951 --> 47:49.411
And I said,
"Well, shoot fire, Mama.

47:49.452 --> 47:50.745
Why didn't you say that
at the beginning?

47:50.787 --> 47:52.205
Let's go."

47:52.247 --> 47:55.208
That's how this feels.
I hear her through me.

47:55.250 --> 47:56.751
Yeah.
Mamas are so special.

We're very blessed
to have them, right?

Dylan's voice,

49:13.078 --> 49:15.288
I thought he was
singing a gospel song.

49:15.330 --> 49:17.791
It touched my heart
and soul that much.

what other kinds of songs

49:21.294 --> 49:22.504
he wants to sing.

What a special talent
and a big heart.

49:25.298 --> 49:26.466
Kaye: He got it all
from his mom.

We got a lot in common,
then.

to go with Reba.

He loves putting on a show,
and he loves music.

51:25.210 --> 51:27.420
My style genre of music,
I would say,

51:27.462 --> 51:30.423
is country mixed with, like,
a little bit of indie.

51:30.465 --> 51:33.677
Currently, with music,
I'm trying to build

51:33.718 --> 51:38.556

on social media platforms.

Good luck.

If I could work with a coach,
I would probably go for Gwen.

how to balance motherhood,

to the blind auditions.

56:42.736 --> 56:43.987
Niall,
do you have one more?

56:44.029 --> 56:45.196
One more.

56:59.544 --> 57:06.718
* I am not the only traveler *

57:06.760 --> 57:11.848
* Who has not repaid his debt *

57:13.058 --> 57:20.148
* I've been searching
for a trail to follow again *

57:20.190 --> 57:25.737
* Take me back
to the night we met *

57:26.529 --> 57:27.864
Oh, my God!

57:27.906 --> 57:29.991
* I had all
and then most of you *

57:30.033 --> 57:33.244
* Some and now none of you *

57:35.080 --> 57:40.377
* Take me back
to the night we met *

57:40.418 --> 57:42.337
Beautiful voice.

touched me y-e-e-e-et *

57:49.928 --> 57:56.476

58:30.385 --> 58:33.346
Hey!

58:33.388 --> 58:35.265
Whoo-hoo!

58:36.433 --> 58:39.227
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

58:39.269 --> 58:41.438
Oh!

58:41.479 --> 58:42.772
Oh, my God.

58:42.814 --> 58:44.691
Who are you,
and where are you from?

58:44.733 --> 58:45.984
My name is Lennon VanderDoes.

58:46.026 --> 58:48.945
I'm 27,
and I'm from Phoenix, Arizona.

58:48.987 --> 58:50.905
[ Cheers and applause ]

58:50.947 --> 58:53.283
Oh, Lennon.
My Lord.

58:53.324 --> 58:56.619
I couldn't have turned quicker
if I tried, honestly.

58:56.661 --> 58:58.038
The first note
that came out of your mouth,

58:58.079 --> 59:00.790
I was like, "Oh, my Lord,
this is so good."

59:00.832 --> 59:02.042
That's honestly
one of my favorite voices

59:02.083 --> 59:03.585
I've heard in the show
this season.

59:04.919 --> 59:07.922
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Niall: There are...

59:07.964 --> 59:09.341
As you can imagine,
there's a lot of people

59:09.382 --> 59:10.675
that come out here
and play guitar

59:10.717 --> 59:12.260
and sing
singer-songwriter stuff,

59:12.302 --> 59:15.388
but not many people come out
with a unique tone.

59:15.430 --> 59:18.141
And it's something
that's so pure and clean,

59:18.183 --> 59:22.312
and even your little raspy bits
in the lower register

59:22.354 --> 59:23.688
add so much character to it.

59:23.730 --> 59:24.981
It's just part of your voice.

59:25.023 --> 59:28.360
I've got one spot
left on my team.

59:28.401 --> 59:30.820
I would give anything.

59:30.862 --> 59:32.530
Anything?
Yeah, anything.

59:32.572 --> 59:34.324
Because if that's
your bar --
I'm a songwriter.

59:34.366 --> 59:36.826
Yeah, that's my main thing.
What kind of stuff?

59:36.868 --> 59:38.244
Just anything
that speaks to me, man.

59:38.286 --> 59:40.413
I'd say that, above all,
I'm a storyteller,

59:40.455 --> 59:42.999
and you're my hero,
as far as that goes.

59:43.041 --> 59:46.211
I mean, for real.
Wow. Wow. Wow.

59:46.252 --> 59:48.505
I can't believe this
is my real life right now,

59:48.546 --> 59:49.881
because for the longest time,

59:49.923 --> 59:51.758
I thought because
my voice is different,

59:51.800 --> 59:53.301
I didn't think it was good.

59:53.343 --> 59:55.178
I didn't think I had a place
on this show, and so --

59:55.220 --> 59:57.305
Oh, no. My God,
you've got more than a place.

59:57.347 --> 59:59.182
It's something
that you should celebrate.

59:59.224 --> 01:00:00.809
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.811
Well, Lennon,
I would have turned around,

01:00:02.852 --> 01:00:04.729
but I have my whole team.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.815
But I absolutely loved
your voice.

01:00:06.856 --> 01:00:08.358
Are you a full-time
musician?

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.404
Yeah, I've been full-time
for just a year, actually.

01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:13.863
I quit my job.

01:00:13.905 --> 01:00:15.907
What I did before that
was I actually worked

01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.867
with people who had
Alzheimer's and dementia.

01:00:17.909 --> 01:00:19.911
Oh, my God.
And very heartbreaking.

01:00:19.953 --> 01:00:21.621
But the one thing
that they still remember

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:22.872
and connect with is music.

01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:24.374
And so, I'd go in
and just sing to them,

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.252
and I quit that job with
50 cents in my bank account.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:29.379
Not the best move,
but, you know, pretty soon,

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:30.964
you just make the connections
you need and you play around.

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:31.965
But, ultimately,
I'm a songwriter.

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.341
I want to play what I'm writing,

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:35.010
and I want to put that
out there, as well.

01:00:35.051 --> 01:00:36.511
Oh, my God.
I love you even more.
So...

01:00:36.553 --> 01:00:38.638
Yeah. Welcome to "The Voice,"
and best of luck to you.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.265
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:00:40.306 --> 01:00:41.307

01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:42.809
Lennon.

01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:45.020
I was waving my hands
like I was at church.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:46.396
I was up on my feet.

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:49.607
It was just a tour de force
of a performance.

01:00:49.649 --> 01:00:52.235
Honestly, you're one of
the best vocalists I've heard.

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:55.655
And we need voices
that are interesting,

01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:57.073
that are distinctive.

01:00:57.115 --> 01:00:59.242
And it just felt like you have
a real point of view.

01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:01.661
You belong out there
making records.

01:01:01.703 --> 01:01:03.079
You belong
out there touring.

01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:05.457
And this is
my eighth season now.

01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:06.833
I have so much experience

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:09.085
helping artists
realize their vision,

01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:10.587
and I believe
I could do that with you.

01:01:10.628 --> 01:01:14.090
I just want to watch your
journey through this business,

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:16.468
because I believe you're going
to be around for a long time.

01:01:16.509 --> 01:01:17.635
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:01:17.677 --> 01:01:19.095
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:22.015
Your songs have been
the soundtrack of my growing up.

01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:24.809
Hi, Lennon.
It's me, Gwen.

01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:26.102
I feel like I'm last,

01:01:26.144 --> 01:01:28.980
and you love him,
and you love him.

[ Chuckles ]
[ Audience "aww"s ]

01:01:31.107 --> 01:01:33.151
But I'm not going to
not fight for you, because --

01:01:33.193 --> 01:01:34.944
You're Gwen Stefani.
Come on.

01:01:34.986 --> 01:01:37.572
Like, come on.
I'm such a good coach.

01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:39.115
I promise you.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:40.950
I was shocked
to see who you were.

01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:43.286
Like, your voice does not sound
like how you look,

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:46.206
and that is just so cool
and so amazing.

01:01:46.247 --> 01:01:47.957
It's sad to think
that you went around

01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:50.085
your whole life going,
"Oh, I hate my voice,

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:51.294
I hate my --"
you know what I mean,

01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:52.796
or whatever you did
in your brain,

01:01:52.837 --> 01:01:54.381
because nobody can be
like you.

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:56.758
And that's just the gift
that God gives us,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.718
is to be unique
and individual.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.638
The lyrics were guiding
your whole vocal performance.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.432
That's the songwriter in you.
I'm also a songwriter.

01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:06.434
It's the greatest thing
in the world

01:02:06.476 --> 01:02:10.355
to be able to write a song
and capture a moment

01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:11.981
and then share it
with people.

01:02:12.023 --> 01:02:14.025
And I really would like
to coach you.

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:15.527
I feel like
I'm the underdog

between these two rock stars
on either side of me.

between all three of us.

beautiful character singers,
some huge rock voices.

of déjà vu, America,

to battle it out,

to battle against anyone,

to be John Legend, ever.

01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:10.160
I've worked so hard
for this moment

01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:12.328
up till now, and I'm ready.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.205
Man: Ladies and gentlemen,
our next artist.

01:05:14.247 --> 01:05:19.169
Taylor:
These four coaches represent
a huge opportunity.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:20.670
I know that teams
are filling up,

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.423
so I just want to make sure
that when I go out there,

01:05:23.465 --> 01:05:25.884
they're going to
remember my voice.

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:27.969
They're going to remember
that I made them feel

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.512
something special.

Sing that song! Aah!

01:07:14.993 --> 01:07:17.120
What's your name,
and where are you from?

01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:18.580
My name is Taylor Deneen.

01:07:18.621 --> 01:07:22.000
I'm 23 years old,
and I'm from Oklahoma City.

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:23.626
My team is full up.

01:07:23.668 --> 01:07:26.629
And I'm so sad because
that is one hell of a voice

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:28.131
that I would have loved
to have pitched for.

01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:29.716
That was flawless.
Thank you so much.

01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:32.302
Oh, they are so lucky
that they were able to turn.

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:33.887
Me and Reba are upset.

01:07:33.928 --> 01:07:35.305
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:37.307
I would have turned around
in a heartbeat.

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:39.142
Your voice is incredible.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.227
Your range is astounding.

01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:43.146
Oklahoma City?
Yes.

01:07:43.188 --> 01:07:44.898
Oklahoma City,
born and raised.

01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.524
Oh, man, that's wonderful.

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:48.401
Get to see a fellow Okie.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:50.820
And there's another
fellow Okie right there.

01:07:50.862 --> 01:07:51.988
Hey!

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.824
Kind of a transplant,
but we claim her.

01:07:54.866 --> 01:07:58.203
I am stunned right now.
That was incredible.

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:00.455
Taylor, don't get
so excited about John.

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:03.333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[ Laughs ]

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.876
Taylor, I'm excited
about you.

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:07.504
I am a Taylor Deneen fan now.

01:08:07.545 --> 01:08:11.341
I literally have one spot
left on my team,

01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:18.264
and I would be overjoyed
for you to complete Team Legend.

01:08:18.306 --> 01:08:19.974
It would be magical for me.

01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:22.686
You just kept getting better
and better and better.

01:08:22.727 --> 01:08:25.814
You kept finding new places
to go with the notes.

01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.649
I need to know more
about your singing.

01:08:27.691 --> 01:08:29.275
Like, where are you
singing now?

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:31.069
What has your path
been like recently?

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:34.614
Well, I graduated from Berklee
College of Music in 2021.
Amazing!

01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:36.324
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:38.576
Since then, I moved back home
to Oklahoma City,

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:41.204
and I'm actually now
working as a songwriter.

01:08:41.246 --> 01:08:42.872
I write a lot
of custom-made songs

01:08:42.914 --> 01:08:45.625
for, like, anniversaries,
birthdays, and holidays.

01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:47.544
I actually kind of wrote
a little something

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:49.879
for you guys today.
Oh, sing it, girl!

01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:51.840
Oh, sing it!
Alright.

* And show the world
which one of us is best *

That's amazing.
Thank you.

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:29.544
You are truly
a phenomenal voice.

01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:31.588
You can do all the runs.
You can do all those things.

01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:33.882
But your voice has
this gentleness, as well.

01:09:33.923 --> 01:09:35.759
It's powerful,
but it's not overpowering.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.345
It's, like, very relaxing
to listen to,

01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:39.596
and it's so sweet.

01:09:39.637 --> 01:09:41.473
It's got
such a honey to it.

01:09:41.514 --> 01:09:43.933
And I would love
to work with you.

that knows everything to say
that's right.

And I respect him so much,

01:09:51.816 --> 01:09:53.401
but I'm going to fight
for you.

[ Laughter ]

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:57.655
I love how feminine
your voice is.

01:09:57.697 --> 01:10:00.617
It's just such a refreshing tone
that you have.

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:01.993
There's this, like,
sneaky, like,

01:10:02.035 --> 01:10:04.245
yeah, it might be feminine,
but watch this.

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:05.372
You know what I mean?

01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:07.624
I know that I don't sing
in your lane

01:10:07.665 --> 01:10:09.668
and that we're different
in that way,

01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:12.545
but I have bounced
in a lot of different genres.

01:10:12.587 --> 01:10:15.382
I understand music.
I'm a songwriter, as well.

01:10:15.423 --> 01:10:19.135
I truly think that I could be
an amazing coach for you.

we're going to have
a lot of fun.

I'm sorry, but --

as your coach?

John: I needed one artist
to fill my team.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.556
I turned for Lennon,
and I would have been very happy

if Lennon was on my team
and completed my team.

I didn't fill up my team

to do this on "The Voice."

Can we consider myself a duo?
I'm just kidding. [ Laughs ]

that's kept me going

through really difficult moments
of my life.

01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:36.041
My husband and I got married
in October of 2016,

01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:40.837
and we started to try to have
a baby in September of '21.

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:44.007
We journeyed through a battle
with infertility.

01:13:44.049 --> 01:13:46.843
Every month
when I'd get a negative test,

01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:50.680
it was just a constant reminder
this isn't happening yet.

01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:52.849
It felt like the months
just kept dragging on

01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:54.351
and kept dragging on.

01:13:54.392 --> 01:13:55.894
I would sit at the piano,

01:13:55.935 --> 01:13:58.355
just playing,
and I'd write this lyric,

01:13:58.396 --> 01:13:59.856
"The valley is not my home."

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:02.650

to the second appointment.

01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:12.160
I actually just started
my second trimester.

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:15.997
Tell me what's better or cooler
than being on "The Voice"

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:18.625
and creating a human,
all at the same time?

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:21.169
[ Laughs ]

01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:23.046
Right now, it's been
a little bit slow

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:25.757
just because of the stage
of life that I'm in,

01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:28.426
but I typically find myself
doing a lot of my gigs

01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:31.638
at festivals in the summer,
gigs at coffee shops,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.014
bands at church.

01:14:33.056 --> 01:14:34.599
Just to have this opportunity,

01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:36.184
I'm not going to
take it for granted.

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:38.937
This could be the start
of something new in my life,

01:14:38.978 --> 01:14:40.772
propelling my career
within music

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:42.857
and also helping me
to tie together

01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:45.235
being a mom and a musician,
all at the same time.

Katie: Hi, guys.
What's your name?

01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:05.357
My name is Katie Wheatley.

01:16:05.398 --> 01:16:08.485
I'm 27 years old,
and I'm from Owasso, Oklahoma.

01:16:08.526 --> 01:16:10.236
Oh.
Owasso.

01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:12.739
I'm actually not here
just with myself.

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:14.240
I'm pregnant right now.

01:16:14.282 --> 01:16:15.700
Oh.
Oh!

01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:16.785
We've been trying
for a year and a half.

01:16:16.826 --> 01:16:18.161
Oh, wow.
Aw, congratulations.

01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:20.038
Yeah. So, we found out
we're pregnant, so, yeah.

[ Applause ]
Thank you.

01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:24.501
I'm sorry we don't have
better news.
That's okay.

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:25.752
Personally,
I just felt like

01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:27.045
you got off to a bit
of a shaky start.

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:28.630
I don't know whether
that's down to nerves.

01:16:28.672 --> 01:16:30.006
I really was
pulling for you

01:16:30.048 --> 01:16:31.466
to turn the corner
with the song.

01:16:31.508 --> 01:16:34.135
It just never kind of
ramped up to those notes.

01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:35.345
Maybe we'll see you
down the line

01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:37.097
and you can walk
a baby out here.

01:16:37.138 --> 01:16:38.348
Sounds good. Yeah.
[ Laughs ]

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.392
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

01:16:40.433 --> 01:16:41.893
Hi, Katie.
Hi, Gwen.

01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:43.311
Congratulations
on your little baby.
Thank you.

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:45.230
That's so exciting.
Appreciate that.

01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:48.274
I really love how you go
in and out of your chest voice.

01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:50.902
You have that little bit
of a scratchy yodel,

01:16:50.944 --> 01:16:53.905
and all those little nuances
are really special.

01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:55.323
It's just really, for me,
trying to get

01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:57.283
a little more control
over the performance,

01:16:57.325 --> 01:16:59.911
because I think dynamically
you want to, like, build it

01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:01.538
a little bit more,
you know what I'm saying?

01:17:01.579 --> 01:17:02.914
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you for coming
and singing for us.

01:17:02.956 --> 01:17:04.040
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:05.583
Yeah,
I think that's a cool idea

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:07.168
to do those kinds
of twists.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.671
I just think you might need to,
like, bring your character out

01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:11.589
in the song
a little bit more, still.
Okay.

01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:12.590
Just a little bit
more attack.

01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:13.675
Yeah, I think.
Yeah?

01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:14.884
But good luck
with the baby,

01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:16.386
and thanks
for coming to see us.

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:17.887
Thank you. Absolutely.
Thank you guys so much.

Thank you.

01:17:20.056 --> 01:17:22.100
Gwen: It always hurts
when you have to turn around

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:23.685
and say no to somebody.

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:25.812
But my team is nearly full,

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:28.690
and I have a team
of incredible singers.

01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:31.067
I have soul, country, pop.

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:32.736
I have somebody that sings
in Spanish.

01:17:32.777 --> 01:17:34.696
I have the most eclectic team.

01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:37.866
My team is amazing, and I cannot
wait to get to coaching.

01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:40.243
Please, just give me
the best person.

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:42.829
I am the only coach
with a spot left,

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.289
and it's a lot of pressure.

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:46.666
Everyone's just sitting here
waiting for me to press.

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:50.337
I'm just going to be patient
and find the right person.

01:17:56.593 --> 01:17:57.927

Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

01:18:00.305 --> 01:18:02.223
Calla: This is the restaurant
I used to work at.

01:18:02.265 --> 01:18:05.018
I was a bartender and a server,
and my favorite drink to make

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.771
was a spicy,
skinny margarita.

01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:09.939
* Wake up and do
the right thing *

01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:10.982
* Get on the right track *

01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:12.192
My name's Calla Prejean.

01:18:12.233 --> 01:18:14.861
I'm 22, and I am
from Houston, Texas,

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:16.613
but I currently live
in Nashville.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:21.534
I first started writing music
professionally when I was 17.

01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:24.621
When I graduated high school,
I didn't go to college.

01:18:24.662 --> 01:18:28.124
I immediately jumped
straight into the industry.

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:30.001
To support myself
through this journey,

01:18:30.043 --> 01:18:32.796
I worked lots of jobs.

01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:34.297
I worked at a juice shop.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:38.134
I was a bartender, a server,
a nanny, a dog sitter,

01:18:38.176 --> 01:18:41.763
and I was an assistant
for Sara Evans,

01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:44.599
which was such a great job.

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.351
Sara, as a country artist,

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:49.646
she's been in the game
for so long and is so respected,

01:18:49.688 --> 01:18:51.898
and it is a little bit different
than my style,

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.483
because I am pop R&B,

01:18:53.525 --> 01:18:56.319
but I grew up listening
to every single genre of music.

01:18:56.361 --> 01:18:58.822
I grew up
listening to Sara Evans.

01:18:58.863 --> 01:19:01.157
I was able to do
so many things

01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:04.202
and see so many different
avenues of an artist,

01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:07.038
so I was able to, like, be
the sponge and soak it all up.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.165
That's going to be you.
[ Chuckles ]

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:11.835
As a personal assistant,
I think the first thing I did

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:13.211
was I saw her
at the Grand Ole Opry,

01:19:13.253 --> 01:19:15.213
which I had never
been there before.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.298
I think it sparked
a little thing inside me.

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.177
I saw her do it at such
a huge level that I was like,

01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:23.013
"I want to be
on that huge level."

01:19:23.054 --> 01:19:26.016
Hey, Calla,
it's Sara Evans,

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:30.186
and I just wanted to wish you
so much luck on "The Voice."

01:19:30.228 --> 01:19:32.939
And we are just
all rooting for you

01:19:32.981 --> 01:19:35.817
and wishing you the very best.

01:19:35.859 --> 01:19:38.111
That was so cool.

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:39.362 --> 01:19:42.198
our next artist
is entering now.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.784
Today, I'll be singing
"You're So Vain" by Carly Simon

01:19:44.826 --> 01:19:46.077
for my blind audition.

01:19:46.119 --> 01:19:48.496
I love the boldness.
She's not afraid.

01:19:48.538 --> 01:19:51.041
She's just going to do it
because that's who she is.

01:19:51.082 --> 01:19:54.586
And that's a lot like
how I am, as well.

01:19:54.627 --> 01:19:55.754

01:19:59.966 --> 01:20:01.259
Sorry.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:06.556
This audition today,
it is a big leap,

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:10.477
and my younger self
would be proud of me.

in the mirror as *

Did you know that you get
to be on Team Gwen

01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:35.020
because she only had
one spot left

01:21:35.061 --> 01:21:36.312
and she wanted
to give it to you?

Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

turned for you, too.

Yeah, me too.
You sounded so great.

so comfortable and confident.

It's just rich
and warm and round.

I think that the one thing
that we can work on together

01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:05.175
is also just sort of mapping out
the song a little bit better,

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:06.509
of when you're going to do
your runs

01:22:06.551 --> 01:22:08.261
and how you're going to do
your runs,

01:22:08.303 --> 01:22:10.388
because I think you have
everything it takes

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:13.433
to just really be very,
very strong on this show.

01:22:13.475 --> 01:22:15.060
I'm excited that
you're going to be on my team

01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:16.394

to work together,

01:22:28.406 --> 01:22:31.242
You've got such a pure
storytelling voice

01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:33.244
that I definitely
would have turned for

01:22:33.286 --> 01:22:35.538
if my team wasn't full
up to the brim.

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.792
Congratulations on making it
on "The Voice" and on Team Gwen.

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:40.710
Thank you so much.

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:43.088
You're going to have
a blast on "The Voice."

01:22:43.129 --> 01:22:44.673
You're going to learn
so much.

01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:49.052
It's totally stuff that
you won't be able to learn

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.595
in a lifetime
anywhere else.

01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:53.014
Have fun,
and welcome to "The Voice."

01:22:53.056 --> 01:22:54.349
Thank you so much.

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.685
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:22:56.726 --> 01:22:58.144
Yay!

01:23:00.605 --> 01:23:02.440
Yes! You did it!
Thank you.

01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:04.401
Congratulations!
Ooh, I love your outfit.

01:23:04.442 --> 01:23:07.278
Calla is just the perfect person
to fill my team.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.281
She has a really rich,
gorgeous voice.

01:23:10.323 --> 01:23:12.575
I think America is going
to really love her.

01:23:12.617 --> 01:23:14.536
Yay! Team Gwen!

01:23:14.577 --> 01:23:17.580
My team is full.
I am so excited.

01:23:17.622 --> 01:23:20.375
I can't wait to get to know
everybody on my team

01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:22.293
and to work with them
and pick songs.

01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:26.506
Season 24 of the blinds
are over.

01:23:26.548 --> 01:23:29.634
Together:
Our teams are full!

01:23:29.676 --> 01:23:31.928

Reba: Yay!

01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:36.266
* I feel like dancing,
I feel like dancing *

01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:37.767
* I feel like dancing *

01:23:37.809 --> 01:23:43.356
I'm blown away by the talent
that is on Season 24.

01:23:43.398 --> 01:23:45.233
Now it's on
to the battle rounds.

01:23:45.275 --> 01:23:48.737
I'm really tickled about getting
in there and starting coaching.

01:23:48.778 --> 01:23:50.280
Whoo-hoo!

01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:51.781
I love the battles.

01:23:51.823 --> 01:23:54.576
This season has been the
biggest and the best season yet.

01:23:54.617 --> 01:23:56.453
I haven't won this show
in a while.

01:23:56.494 --> 01:23:57.620
I think it's time.

01:23:57.662 --> 01:24:00.123
Reba,
your blinds are done!

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:01.875
Yay, John!

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:03.585
That was fun.
