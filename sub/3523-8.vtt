02:42.846 --> 02:43.847
The lid, dude.

02:44.347 --> 02:45.849
She's from
okla- fuckin'- homa.

02:45.849 --> 02:47.350
So, jackie, you're

02:47.350 --> 02:49.352

I came up here
to see you.

02:51.354 --> 02:53.356

02:53.356 --> 02:56.359

first hit's free.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.870
Just don't
tell your dad.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.872
I don't
even talk to
him anymore.

03:14.878 --> 03:17.380
Read'em and

03:17.380 --> 03:21.384

You'll be on a slab

04:24.447 --> 04:25.949
Hello, anthony.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.459
You look good.

04:42.966 --> 04:44.968
Want a drink?

04:44.968 --> 04:47.470
Another time,
anthony.

04:49.973 --> 04:51.474
Another time.

05:01.484 --> 05:04.487
Let's whack this cocksucker
and be done with it.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.991
I'm here to
enjoy myself.

05:12.996 --> 05:14.998
I'm so fuckin' hard.

05:19.502 --> 05:21.504
No, jackie, don't.

05:31.014 --> 05:32.515
Meadow.

05:33.016 --> 05:35.018
Meadow, wake up.

05:35.018 --> 05:37.020
I'm so sleepy.

05:37.020 --> 05:39.022
You drank too much
fuckin' tequila.

05:39.522 --> 05:41.524
C'mon, i can't
stop now.

06:16.059 --> 06:19.062
"Another time,
anthony"?

06:19.062 --> 06:21.064
Cocksucker turns
his back on the boss?

06:21.064 --> 06:22.565
That i couldn't
believe.

06:22.565 --> 06:24.067
He's lucky i didn't put
one in his fuckin' head!

06:24.567 --> 06:27.070
On that front, don't
be surprised if paulie
pops the question.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.572
Ralphie's star
is rising.

06:29.572 --> 06:32.575
All those unions.

06:33.076 --> 06:35.078
Paulie can't come near
that kinda cash for us.

06:35.078 --> 06:36.579
Ralphie's a
good earner.

06:36.579 --> 06:38.081
Guy like that...

06:38.081 --> 06:39.582
loose cannon.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.585
You'll be leaving your hou
he'll pull a jack ruby on you.

06:43.086 --> 06:45.088
Why'd i have to punch
this fuckin' asshole?

06:45.088 --> 06:46.589
Frankly...

06:46.589 --> 06:48.591
i was a little
surprised.

06:48.591 --> 06:50.593
You're gonna start
on me now, huh?

06:51.094 --> 06:52.595
He disrespected
"the bing".

06:52.595 --> 06:54.597
So, he's barre
d from the place.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.603
He bashed
that poor
girl's brains in.

07:00.603 --> 07:02.105
I hear you...

07:02.105 --> 07:03.606
i know.

07:03.606 --> 07:05.608
It was a tragedy.

07:05.608 --> 07:07.110
The fact is though,

07:07.610 --> 07:09.612
she was not related to
you by blood or marriage.

07:10.113 --> 07:11.614
She was no
t your goomata.

07:11.614 --> 07:14.117
Ralphie's
a made guy, ton'.

07:14.117 --> 07:16.619
All things considered,
he's got a legitimate beef.

07:18.121 --> 07:21.124
Make him disappear
or make nice.

07:21.124 --> 07:23.626
You only got
two choices.

07:27.130 --> 07:30.133
I would suggest someth
ing in the way of an apology.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.135
Absolutely
fuckin' not!

07:32.635 --> 07:35.138
Do something public that
shows there's no bad blood.

07:35.138 --> 07:36.639
Give him...

07:36.639 --> 07:38.641
give him a piece
of the casino.

07:39.142 --> 07:41.144
We're partnered
with new york on that

07:41.644 --> 07:44.147
and i don't want him
that close to johnny sack.

07:44.147 --> 07:47.150
You could bump him
up to captain.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.652
It's what he's bee
n wanting, you know.

07:49.652 --> 07:52.155
Ralphie a fuckin'
captain...

07:55.158 --> 07:57.160
over my dead body.

08:00.663 --> 08:01.664
Thank you.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.669
You see that
shit before?

08:06.669 --> 08:09.672
The look on tony's
face when i turned
down that drink?

08:10.173 --> 08:11.674
Buy me a drink?
Fuck you.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.676
He knew it
was wrong,
what he did.

08:13.676 --> 08:15.678
He is
the boss,

08:15.678 --> 08:17.680
he could do
what he wants.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.182
Boss or no,

08:19.182 --> 08:21.684
you don't raise
your hands to
another made guy.

08:21.684 --> 08:24.687
Joe mo from mulberry street,
exact same situation.

08:24.687 --> 08:26.689
He smacked that guy
from north bergen around.

08:26.689 --> 08:27.690
Huge problem.

08:28.191 --> 08:29.192
Of course.

08:29.192 --> 08:31.194
Rules are rules,
otherwise, what?

08:31.194 --> 08:32.695
Fuckin' anarchy.

08:32.695 --> 08:35.198
At the very least,
tony owes you an apology.

08:35.198 --> 08:37.200
The money i put
in his pocket for
construction alone,

08:37.200 --> 08:39.202
he should hit his
knees, this prick.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.203
What?

08:41.203 --> 08:43.206
You think i'm afraid
of that fat fuck?

08:43.706 --> 08:45.708
No offense.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.710
I could see
if it was
his daughter,

08:48.211 --> 08:49.712
or a niece of his,

08:49.712 --> 08:53.216
but all this over
some dead whore.

08:53.216 --> 08:55.718
He had to be
fuckin' her.

08:55.718 --> 08:56.719
No.

08:56.719 --> 08:59.222
He knew you were
fuckin' her.

08:59.222 --> 09:01.224
That's why,
that's how he is,

09:01.224 --> 09:03.226
like a dog
with two bones.

09:03.726 --> 09:06.229
I'm supposed to
go over there...

09:06.229 --> 09:09.232
for thanksgiving,
me and ro, tony's.

09:09.732 --> 09:10.733
Really?

09:10.733 --> 09:12.235
Fuck him
and his turkey.

09:12.735 --> 09:15.238
I oughta shove a
drumstick up his ass.

09:23.746 --> 09:25.748
Look who i
caught sneaking
in the fire door.

09:26.249 --> 09:28.751
My parishioners
might not
understand

09:28.751 --> 09:30.253
i'm here to help
feed the hungry.

09:31.754 --> 09:33.256
Reverend.

09:33.256 --> 09:34.257
Happy thanksgiving.

09:34.757 --> 09:36.259
Madonn',
who needs it?

09:36.259 --> 09:38.261
Oh, c'mon, turkey,
sweet potatoes,
pumpkin pie?

09:38.261 --> 09:39.762
You gotta
love all that.

09:39.762 --> 09:42.765
That's because
you never lived through
the "walyo" version.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.767
Major antipast' first.

09:45.268 --> 09:46.269
Then soup,

09:46.269 --> 09:47.770
meatballs
and scharol

09:47.770 --> 09:50.273
then the baked
manigott',

09:50.273 --> 09:52.275
then the bird.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.777
I love manicotti.

09:54.777 --> 09:55.778
Turkeys
are here.

09:56.279 --> 09:57.780
There are some
in here, too.

10:00.283 --> 10:03.286
Thing with turkeys,
they got no sense
of direction.

10:03.286 --> 10:06.289
They're on their
way to food emporium
and now look.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.793
What's this i
hear about ralph
cifaretto?

10:11.294 --> 10:13.296
He refused to
have a drink w
ith you at the club?

10:13.296 --> 10:15.298
So?

10:15.298 --> 10:18.301
He refused the
drink'cause h
e's a despicable fuck

10:18.301 --> 10:20.803
that i bitch- slapp
ed at a moment of
very justified anger.

10:20.803 --> 10:23.306
That sounds like
a problem.

10:25.308 --> 10:27.310
Happy thanksgiving
to you and yours.

10:27.810 --> 10:28.811
Yeah, you too.

10:28.811 --> 10:30.813
Happy thanksgiving,
reverend.

10:30.813 --> 10:31.814
That mine?

10:32.315 --> 10:33.816
Ah, beautiful.

10:33.816 --> 10:34.817
Look at that.

10:35.818 --> 10:37.320
Ah, shit!

10:37.320 --> 10:38.821
What's the matter?

10:39.322 --> 10:41.324
That fuckin' asshole's
supposed to come
to thanksgiving

10:41.324 --> 10:42.825
with rosalie.

10:42.825 --> 10:44.327
No way
he'll show.

10:44.327 --> 10:45.828
I'm gonna give
him the option?

10:46.329 --> 10:48.331
That cocksucker
shouldn't even be ther
e in the first place.

10:51.834 --> 10:55.338
Honey, i know
you don't like to--

10:56.839 --> 10:59.342
i know you don't like
to be pinned down,

10:59.342 --> 11:02.345
but thanksgiving, it would
be very nice to be able to

11:02.345 --> 11:04.347
tell carmela
whether you're coming.

11:04.847 --> 11:06.849
Who's gonna
be there?

11:06.849 --> 11:08.351
Besides us?

11:08.351 --> 11:10.353
I don't know,
carm's parents.

11:10.353 --> 11:11.854
Great.

11:11.854 --> 11:13.856
How about meadow?

11:13.856 --> 11:16.859
So, thanksgiving,
who's all coming
this year?

11:16.859 --> 11:18.361
You know,
the usual.

11:18.861 --> 11:20.363
Nana and grandpa...

11:20.363 --> 11:21.864
chris and ade.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.867
I think janice is bringing
someone from her prayer group.

11:25.368 --> 11:27.370
Um, and aunt ro
and uncle ralph.

11:27.870 --> 11:30.373
Jackie's probably
not coming though, right?

11:30.873 --> 11:32.375
Oh, i don't know, why?

11:32.375 --> 11:33.876
Can't i just
ask anything?

11:33.876 --> 11:35.378
Alright,
take it easy.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.879
I have class, i'll
see you thursday.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.881
Alright, bye.

11:44.387 --> 11:45.388
Hello.

11:45.888 --> 11:46.889
Hey, carm,
it's ro.

11:47.390 --> 11:48.891
God, that is so weird
that you just called.

11:49.392 --> 11:50.393
I just hung up
with meadow

11:50.393 --> 11:52.395
and she was asking if jackie
was coming for thanksgiving.

11:52.395 --> 11:53.896
Oh, really?

11:53.896 --> 11:56.399
Jackie just asked
me about her.

11:56.399 --> 11:57.400
My radar's up.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.403
Oh, you and those
romance novels, rosalie.

12:00.403 --> 12:02.905
Can you imagine
the beautiful children

12:02.905 --> 12:05.408
those two would make,
with those genes?

12:05.408 --> 12:07.910
Remember when meadow
was born, what we said?

12:07.910 --> 12:09.912
Yes, we said a lot
of things, ro.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.915
Do me a favor,
concentrate on that almond
torte of yours, alright?

12:12.915 --> 12:14.417
I'm counting on you.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.418
I'm looking
for the recipe.

12:15.918 --> 12:16.919
Alright, bye.

12:23.426 --> 12:24.927
Here's the turkey.

12:24.927 --> 12:26.429
Oh, my god,
it's huge.

12:26.929 --> 12:29.432
Good thing, i'm
feeding an army
this year.

12:29.932 --> 12:31.434
Not as many
as you think.

12:31.434 --> 12:34.437
I need you to call rosalie
and cancel with them.

12:34.437 --> 12:36.439
Thanksgiving, why?

12:36.439 --> 12:37.940
Just do it,
alright?

12:37.940 --> 12:39.442
Enough of this
jetson's shit

12:39.442 --> 12:41.444
them coming over to
mr. Spacely's house
for dinner.

12:41.444 --> 12:43.446
I was just talking
to her, what
am i gonna say?

12:43.446 --> 12:44.947
Fine, i'll call.

12:44.947 --> 12:47.450
And my excuse won't be
nearly as nice as yours.

12:50.953 --> 12:52.955
Goddamnit, tony.

12:54.457 --> 12:56.959
What, your
stomach still?

13:05.468 --> 13:07.470
Dr. Akavi?

13:07.470 --> 13:11.474
Gloria trillo,
globe mercedes.

13:12.475 --> 13:17.480
Listen, a pre- owned
2001 s- 600 just came in.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.982
You're the first
person i thought of.

13:19.982 --> 13:22.985
Wood trim package,
gps with everything.

13:23.486 --> 13:26.489
Only 7500 miles,

13:28.991 --> 13:31.994
i don't think
it's gonna las
t till saturday.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.996
Tomorrow?

13:33.996 --> 13:35.498
Great.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.003
No, i'm sorry, i can't,
we're doing a sales
meeting at lunch.

13:42.004 --> 13:44.006
Okay, see ya...

13:44.006 --> 13:46.008
bye.

13:59.522 --> 14:01.524
You waiting for
somebody in there?

14:01.524 --> 14:03.025
I got an
appointment.

14:03.025 --> 14:04.527
Did she
double- book us?

14:04.527 --> 14:06.529
I'm usually thursday,

14:07.029 --> 14:09.031
but i had to reschedule
because of the holiday.

14:09.031 --> 14:11.534
This is when
i usually come.

14:14.537 --> 14:18.541
I'm trying to
quit smoking.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.543
Serial killer.

14:20.543 --> 14:23.546
I murdered
seven relationships.

14:25.047 --> 14:26.549
Listen, you're here.

14:26.549 --> 14:28.551
Why don't you take
my appointment?

14:28.551 --> 14:30.553
Oh, no, no,
i couldn't
do that, no.

14:30.553 --> 14:32.555
It would be my good
deed for the day.

14:34.056 --> 14:36.058
Flag on the play.

14:36.058 --> 14:38.060
I'm pretty sure
you said tuesday.

14:38.561 --> 14:39.562
I did?

14:40.062 --> 14:42.064
I'll come back next we
ek at the same time and...

14:42.064 --> 14:44.066
no problemo.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.568
I told her she could
have my appointment.

14:46.068 --> 14:47.570
Actually, it is
a little difficult

14:48.070 --> 14:49.572
getting away
from work.

14:49.572 --> 14:50.573
See?

14:52.575 --> 14:53.576
I...

14:53.576 --> 14:56.078
i could see you
tonight at seven.

14:57.580 --> 15:00.082
Yeah,
yeah, thanks.

15:00.082 --> 15:01.083
Okay.

15:01.584 --> 15:03.085
How hard was that?

15:17.099 --> 15:18.601
Hello?

15:18.601 --> 15:20.102
Ro, it's carm.

15:20.102 --> 15:24.106
This is so terrible to do
on such short notice,

15:24.106 --> 15:26.108
but i just got off
the phone with ma.

15:26.108 --> 15:27.109
What's the matter?

15:27.109 --> 15:28.110
It's my father.

15:28.611 --> 15:30.112
They had some
troubling test results.

15:30.112 --> 15:31.614
Something to do with
his white blood cells.

15:32.114 --> 15:33.616
Oh, my god.

15:33.616 --> 15:35.618
Yeah, i know, uh...

15:35.618 --> 15:37.620
they're gonna have to
do further testing

15:37.620 --> 15:39.622
before they can be
sure of the diagnosis.

15:39.622 --> 15:41.624
Ma just wants to have
a quiet thanksgiving.

15:41.624 --> 15:44.126
She said that they
would have it just
the two of them, but--

15:44.627 --> 15:46.128
they should be
with their family.

15:46.128 --> 15:49.131
I feel so awful giving
you so little notice.

15:49.131 --> 15:52.635
Don't be silly, i
just wish there wa
s something i could do.

15:52.635 --> 15:54.637
Thank you, ro,
that is so sweet.

15:54.637 --> 15:57.139
Of course, i'll let you know
when i know anything more.

15:57.139 --> 15:58.641
Okay, take care,
sweetheart.

15:58.641 --> 16:00.142
Bye.

16:00.142 --> 16:02.144
Alright, bye- bye.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.652
Carm's father,
he's sick.

16:09.652 --> 16:12.655
She had to cancel
thanksgiving.

16:18.661 --> 16:20.162
It's three a. M.

16:20.162 --> 16:22.665
Bam, come
wide awake.

16:23.165 --> 16:25.167
Something specific?

16:25.167 --> 16:27.169
It's a management
problem.

16:27.169 --> 16:29.171
It's a situation
with an underling.

16:29.171 --> 16:31.674
Now, it's partly
my fault.

16:31.674 --> 16:34.677
But he never should've
done what he did.

16:35.177 --> 16:36.679
What was it?

16:36.679 --> 16:38.681
Could you
tell me that?

16:39.181 --> 16:43.185
He caused the...

16:43.185 --> 16:45.187
early retirement...

16:46.689 --> 16:48.190
of somebody else.

16:50.693 --> 16:53.195
The particulars aren't
important, he fucked up.

16:56.198 --> 16:59.702
Ordinarily, i would
just, you know...

16:59.702 --> 17:01.704
put him
out to pasture.

17:01.704 --> 17:04.205
But he's a very valuable
piece of manpower.

17:04.205 --> 17:07.710
Is it complicated by a
personal relationship?

17:14.717 --> 17:16.719
I been reading that...

17:16.719 --> 17:19.221
book you
told me about.

17:19.221 --> 17:22.724
"The art of war",
by sun tzu.

17:25.227 --> 17:27.229
Here's this guy...

17:27.229 --> 17:31.734
a chinese general, wrote
this thing 2400 years ago.

17:31.734 --> 17:34.236
And most of it
still applies today.

17:34.236 --> 17:36.238
Balk the enemy's power.

17:36.238 --> 17:38.741
Force him to
reveal himself.

17:38.741 --> 17:40.743
Uh, i have to ask...

17:40.743 --> 17:42.745
are you in any
sort of danger?

17:43.245 --> 17:44.747
No, can i go on?

17:46.749 --> 17:49.752
Most of the guys that i know,
they read prince machiavelli.

17:49.752 --> 17:52.755
I had carmela go and get
the cliff notes once...

17:54.256 --> 17:56.759
he's okay.

17:57.259 --> 18:00.262
But this book is much
better about strategy.

18:08.771 --> 18:11.774
Listen, i wanted to
ask you about the girl.

18:11.774 --> 18:13.776
That woman that
was here today.

18:14.276 --> 18:15.778
The mercedes
saleslady.

18:15.778 --> 18:17.780
I'm very sorry
about the confusion.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.782
What does somebody like
that need a shrink for?

18:19.782 --> 18:22.785
I can't talk about
another patient.

18:23.285 --> 18:24.286
Just...

18:25.788 --> 18:27.790
it makes you wonder,
that's all.

18:40.803 --> 18:43.806
It's after hours,
it's dark.

18:45.307 --> 18:47.810
You want me to walk
you to your car?

18:48.811 --> 18:50.813
No, thank you.

18:51.313 --> 18:54.316
I have some work i have
to catch up on here.

19:05.327 --> 19:06.829
Anyone for
a turtle?

19:06.829 --> 19:08.831
Hmm?

19:08.831 --> 19:10.833
Aaron, honey.

19:10.833 --> 19:11.834
Hey!

19:11.834 --> 19:12.835
What?

19:13.335 --> 19:14.837
Oh.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.338
Who's winning?

19:16.338 --> 19:18.340
Like you even know
who's playin'.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.842
It so happens
that i do.

19:19.842 --> 19:21.343
Detroit plays
every thanksgiving.

19:21.343 --> 19:24.346
What a shame barry
sanders retired.

19:24.346 --> 19:26.348
He's a real
sweetheart.

19:26.348 --> 19:28.350
A. J. , did you tell
your dad and your grandpa

19:28.350 --> 19:30.853
how i served him
when i waitressed
at kenny roger's?

19:30.853 --> 19:32.354
Colonel sanders.

19:32.354 --> 19:34.857
No, at kenny rogers,
barry sanders.

19:34.857 --> 19:37.359
Yeah, sh
e served him.

19:45.367 --> 19:46.869
Yes!

19:46.869 --> 19:47.870
Hey.

19:56.879 --> 19:58.881
Yeah!

20:06.889 --> 20:08.390
Hey.

20:08.390 --> 20:09.391
Hey.

20:11.393 --> 20:14.897
Meadow, you know i lov
e you more than anything
in this world, right?

20:14.897 --> 20:17.900
Dad, what are you
talking about?

20:17.900 --> 20:21.403
I know things haven't been
so good with us lately,

20:21.403 --> 20:22.905
it's just...

20:24.406 --> 20:26.909
if anything were eve
r to happen to you...

20:26.909 --> 20:29.411
everybody, come
on, dinner!

20:29.411 --> 20:30.913
Go ahead.

20:36.919 --> 20:40.422
I'll tell you, thi
s turned out to be
a blessing in disguise.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.925
My two boys...

20:42.925 --> 20:46.428
i was worried about
the gravy, but...

20:48.931 --> 20:50.432
ralph, honey,
you feel alright?

20:50.432 --> 20:52.935
You hardly touched
your manigott'.

20:52.935 --> 20:55.938
I'm fine,
christ, please,
how many times?

20:55.938 --> 21:00.442
Jackie, honey, you don't
have to stay for dessert
if you don't want to.

21:00.442 --> 21:02.444
Jesus chri
st, a little
manners, huh?

21:02.444 --> 21:03.946
What'd she
just say?

21:03.946 --> 21:04.947
It's okay.

21:04.947 --> 21:06.448
Why do
n't you go see

21:06.448 --> 21:08.951
if meadow wants to go
to a movie or something?

21:08.951 --> 21:10.452
Sure, ma.

21:11.453 --> 21:12.955
Good dinner.

21:17.459 --> 21:19.461
I'll tell ya
a nifty trick.

21:19.461 --> 21:21.463
Break off a piece
of ohio kitchen match,

21:21.964 --> 21:22.965
in the screw hole,

21:22.965 --> 21:24.967
give the
threads something
to grab onto.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.969
Yeah?

21:26.969 --> 21:28.971
'Cause i used th
e elmer's and th
e knob still fell out.

21:28.971 --> 21:30.472
Forget about it.

21:39.982 --> 21:43.485
Narcolepsy
is an a. S. D. A.
Certified dissomnia.

21:43.986 --> 21:45.487
It's no picnic.

21:45.487 --> 21:47.489
Almost time for
turkey sandwiches!

21:49.491 --> 21:50.993
I'll put
more coffee on.

21:52.494 --> 21:54.496
Oh, my god, who
could that be?

21:54.496 --> 21:56.999
It's the boston
strangler, jesus, ma.

21:56.999 --> 21:58.000
I'll get it.

22:01.003 --> 22:03.005
Hey.

22:03.505 --> 22:04.506
Hey!

22:04.506 --> 22:06.008
Jackie, hi!

22:06.008 --> 22:09.011
I guess you know
everybody here

22:09.011 --> 22:12.014
except for aaron,
janice's friend.

22:12.014 --> 22:13.515
Hey, aaron.

22:13.515 --> 22:15.517
Have you heard
the good news?

22:17.019 --> 22:18.520
He is risen.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.023
Sit down, we're gonna have
some turkey sandwiches.

22:21.523 --> 22:25.027
Thanks,
i already ate.

22:25.027 --> 22:28.030
Just figured i'd
see if meadow wanted
to do something.

22:28.030 --> 22:30.032
See a movie,
whatever.

22:31.533 --> 22:34.036
Sure, i mean, i was gonna
go over to hunter's.

22:34.036 --> 22:35.037
You wanna go?

22:35.037 --> 22:36.538
Whatever.

22:36.538 --> 22:39.541
I'll be down
in a sec.

22:39.541 --> 22:41.543
A soprano
and an aprile.

22:45.047 --> 22:48.050
So, how's school,
everything good, right?

22:48.050 --> 22:50.552
Yeah, gpa's up
this quarter.

22:56.058 --> 22:59.061
Why don't you just bag
it, and come to dov's?

23:00.062 --> 23:02.064
Hunter's
expecting me.

23:20.082 --> 23:22.084
We can hang out
all weekend.

23:22.084 --> 23:24.086
We wouldn't have to
like do anything.

23:26.088 --> 23:28.090
I have to study.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.092
Don't you have
midterms too?

23:30.092 --> 23:31.593
I don't ev
en go anymore.

23:32.094 --> 23:32.594
What?

23:33.095 --> 23:34.096
Why?

23:34.096 --> 23:36.598
Organic chemistry?

23:36.598 --> 23:38.600
Nucleotides and shit.

23:40.102 --> 23:42.604
You wanna know wha
t i'm interested in?

23:42.604 --> 23:44.606
Men's fashion.

23:44.606 --> 23:48.110
Not the faggy part of
it, but like to be hugo boss.

23:49.611 --> 23:51.613
Did you ever think
of applying to fit?

23:51.613 --> 23:54.116
It's supposed to be
a good school for that.

23:54.116 --> 23:55.617
Come on,
come to dov's.

23:56.118 --> 23:58.120
I wanna be
with you so bad.

24:00.622 --> 24:02.624
I can't, jackie.

24:06.128 --> 24:07.629
What?

24:08.130 --> 24:11.133
You won't go
with me, but you'd
go with that black guy?

24:11.133 --> 24:13.635
It's not that i
don't want to go.

24:13.635 --> 24:15.637
I've been hurt.

24:17.139 --> 24:19.641
Just give me
some time, okay?

24:39.161 --> 24:40.662
...as street corners

24:40.662 --> 24:42.664
are heaps of crumbled
wrath and masonry.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.666
...darling christmas gift--

24:44.666 --> 24:47.169
three shuttles remain, now--

24:49.171 --> 24:52.174
it makes me crazy,
rosalie, all of them.

24:52.174 --> 24:54.676
They're alread
y hiring the caterers.

24:54.676 --> 24:57.679
I mean, we were young
when we got married,
but those two?

24:57.679 --> 24:59.681
Emotionally they are
much younger than we were.

25:00.182 --> 25:01.683
...until then,

25:01.683 --> 25:04.686
here's how you'll
get your thrills.

25:07.189 --> 25:10.192
The mercedes- benz
coups and convertibles.

25:10.192 --> 25:11.693
Earth to tony.

25:13.695 --> 25:16.198
I'm thinking of
getting one of those.

25:16.198 --> 25:18.700
What,
a mercedes?

25:18.700 --> 25:21.203
Go ahead, it's
a cute car.

25:23.205 --> 25:25.207
You hear?

25:25.207 --> 25:27.709
T disinvited ralph
to thanksgiving.

25:27.709 --> 25:28.710
No shit.

25:28.710 --> 25:29.711
Madonn'.

25:30.212 --> 25:32.714
Tony sees
the big picture.

25:32.714 --> 25:34.216
Oh, little paulie.

25:34.216 --> 25:35.717
Hey, ton'.

25:35.717 --> 25:37.219
This prick
treating you okay?

25:37.219 --> 25:39.721
No complaints.

25:39.721 --> 25:41.723
C'mon, little paulie,
everybody,

25:41.723 --> 25:44.226
i'll buy you
an egg cream.

25:45.727 --> 25:47.229
C'mon,
sit down.

25:56.238 --> 25:57.739
So...

25:57.739 --> 26:01.243
how are things going ove
r there with our friend?

26:01.243 --> 26:03.245
The same,
you know.

26:03.245 --> 26:05.247
What's he saying
about me?

26:05.247 --> 26:08.250
To me? Nothing,
he knows better.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.751
He's still breaking
my balls though,

26:09.751 --> 26:11.753
about taking
orders from me.

26:11.753 --> 26:13.755
Plus now, with you and him
and all that other shit there.

26:14.256 --> 26:16.258
It's your job to
make my job easier.

26:16.258 --> 26:18.260
I'm not complaining,
you asked me.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.762
He's a frustrating guy.

26:23.765 --> 26:26.268
I don't know how
things are gonna go...

26:26.768 --> 26:29.271
but i can't promis
e he's gonna go away.

26:29.271 --> 26:30.772
It's not just him.

26:30.772 --> 26:32.274
This freon deal.

26:32.274 --> 26:34.276
We're in the middle
of a major renovation
at the house,

26:34.776 --> 26:37.279
i got two kids
getting ready for
college soon.

26:37.279 --> 26:40.782
Hey, hang in there
, you're doing a good job.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.302
Did you see
those bags?

27:00.302 --> 27:02.304
Fuckin' stress
is killing him.

27:02.304 --> 27:03.305
Yeah.

27:03.305 --> 27:07.309
Maybe he wants
my fuckin' job.

27:07.309 --> 27:10.812
...it's a matter of
honor this thanksgiving

27:10.812 --> 27:13.815
because everyone a
t texas remembers turkey
day two years ago...

27:14.316 --> 27:15.817
sure you don't wanna eat
? i got a little turkey left.

27:15.817 --> 27:17.319
No, than
k you, dear.

27:17.319 --> 27:18.820
Johnny, please,
don't get up.

27:19.321 --> 27:21.823
I'm off to physical
therapy, hon.

27:22.824 --> 27:25.327
Used to be some
hoofer, poor thing.

27:25.327 --> 27:27.829
Takes a terrible
toll on the joints.

27:32.334 --> 27:34.836
You heard what he di
d with thanksgiving?

27:34.836 --> 27:37.839
It's not good,
ralph.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.841
Will you please tell m
e what i did to this guy?

27:40.342 --> 27:43.345
Turn down a drink
? i wasn't thirsty!

27:43.345 --> 27:44.846
Ralph.

27:44.846 --> 27:46.848
Ever since i'm back fr
om miami he's up my ass!

27:46.848 --> 27:48.850
I'm earning with
three hands here,

27:48.850 --> 27:51.853
and it's still not good enough
to satisfy this cocksucker!

27:51.853 --> 27:54.356
And then he
fuckin' hits me?

27:56.358 --> 27:57.859
I'm telling you, john.

27:57.859 --> 27:59.861
He's not leaving me
a lot of options here.

27:59.861 --> 28:00.862
Don't talk crazy!

28:00.862 --> 28:04.366
You wanna commit suicide,
pills are a lot easier.

28:10.372 --> 28:11.873
What do you th
ink carmine wouldsay

28:11.873 --> 28:13.875
if i wanted to
switch families?

28:13.875 --> 28:15.377
Come w
ith you guys.

28:15.377 --> 28:17.879
Carmine doesn't
know who you are.

28:17.879 --> 28:19.881
You could tell him.

28:19.881 --> 28:22.384
Ralph,
listen to me.

28:22.384 --> 28:24.886
As a friend...

28:24.886 --> 28:26.888
i know tony
can be difficult.

28:26.888 --> 28:28.890
His father was the
same, his uncle,

28:28.890 --> 28:30.892
they always need
someone to demonize.

28:30.892 --> 28:33.895
But new york and
the sopranos have
long- standing ties

28:33.895 --> 28:35.897
and that's
not gonna change,

28:35.897 --> 28:37.899
not for you
or anybody else.

28:37.899 --> 28:39.901
You want me
to be frank?

28:39.901 --> 28:42.904
You brought
this on yourself
with that girl.

28:42.904 --> 28:44.906
"A", she was
a whore,

28:45.407 --> 28:47.909
"b", she hit me.

28:49.411 --> 28:52.414
And that wasn't my
kid she was carrying.

28:57.419 --> 28:59.421
It was the
fucking coke,

28:59.921 --> 29:02.424
i should've never
started with that shit.

29:02.924 --> 29:06.928
Fuckin' miami, it'
s all over the place.

29:06.928 --> 29:08.930
Just tell anthony
you're sorry.

29:08.930 --> 29:10.932
I was high
, i admit it,

29:10.932 --> 29:12.934
and i swear to christ
i'm not doing it anymore.

29:13.435 --> 29:15.437
"Tony, i'm sorry."

29:15.437 --> 29:16.938
Fuck that, what good
would it do?

29:17.439 --> 29:18.440
It might
save your life!

29:18.940 --> 29:20.942
He hit me!

29:20.942 --> 29:23.445
He was wrong,
believe me, he knows.

29:26.948 --> 29:29.951
You don't think i know
people are laughing
behind my back?

29:30.452 --> 29:32.954
I'll talk to tony,
i'm sure he'll
make it right.

29:32.954 --> 29:34.456
At this
point, how?

29:34.456 --> 29:36.958
I don't know.

29:39.961 --> 29:42.464
Would you take
capo of your crew?

29:43.965 --> 29:47.469
No, no, i wouldn't
, no fuckin' way.

29:47.469 --> 29:49.471
Ralph cifaretto
came by.

29:49.971 --> 29:51.473
What'd he want,

29:51.473 --> 29:55.477
a fully- fueled jet
and a safe trip to the pope?

29:55.477 --> 29:57.479
He's running scared si
nce you cancelled that dinner.

29:57.479 --> 30:00.482
If your opponent
is of choleric
temper, irritate him.

30:00.482 --> 30:02.484
Yeah, well,

30:02.484 --> 30:04.986
he wants
to apologize.

30:04.986 --> 30:06.488
Oh, really?

30:06.488 --> 30:08.990
Would that p
ut this to rest?

30:11.493 --> 30:13.495
If it's sincere.

30:13.495 --> 30:17.499
It might relieve me of
a very unpleasant decision.

30:17.499 --> 30:20.001
You know, they're about to
break ground on the esplanade.

30:20.502 --> 30:23.004
We're talking about
millions of dollars
here, tony.

30:23.004 --> 30:25.507
It wouldn't hurt either of
to have a point man in there

30:25.507 --> 30:27.008
feels appreciated.

30:28.510 --> 30:30.011
I'm just saying.

30:30.011 --> 30:32.514
It wouldn't hurt
to throw him a bone.

30:32.514 --> 30:33.515
Like what?

30:36.017 --> 30:37.018
Capo?

30:37.018 --> 30:38.520
No fuckin' way.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.021
Never.

30:41.022 --> 30:43.024
You heard
what he did.

30:43.024 --> 30:46.027
That poor girl just
had her 20th birthday.

30:46.027 --> 30:47.529
Capo's what
he mentioned.

30:47.529 --> 30:50.031
I threw cold water
on it right away.

30:51.533 --> 30:54.536
But she was
a whore, tony.

30:54.536 --> 30:58.540
I don't want to talk about
that situation ever again,
with anybody.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.041
You understand me?

31:00.041 --> 31:02.043
It was just
a suggestion,

31:02.043 --> 31:03.545
keep a happy shop.

31:03.545 --> 31:05.046
Correct me
if i'm wrong,

31:05.046 --> 31:07.048
didn't you say you weren't
gonna stick your beak in?

31:07.048 --> 31:08.550
Can't two friends talk?

31:08.550 --> 31:12.053
I talked to him, he's
delighted you wanna see him.

31:12.053 --> 31:14.556
Great, he
said that?

31:15.056 --> 31:16.558
That's great.

31:17.058 --> 31:18.560
That's fuckin'
great news.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.561
What'd i tell you?

31:19.561 --> 31:21.062
Listen, the
other thing,

31:21.062 --> 31:24.065
what's he gonna do
to make that right?

31:24.065 --> 31:25.567
Just talk to him.

31:25.567 --> 31:27.569
He indicated he's very open
to working something out.

31:27.569 --> 31:29.571
Thank you,
thank you.

31:29.571 --> 31:31.072
Anything!

31:31.072 --> 31:33.575
Thank you,
thank you.

31:37.579 --> 31:39.080
Oh, fabian!

31:39.080 --> 31:41.082
The fuck you doing
up before noon?

31:41.082 --> 31:42.584
I'm moving out,

31:42.584 --> 31:44.085
over to dov's.

31:45.587 --> 31:47.589
Beanie boy?

31:47.589 --> 31:50.091
Yeah, his reserve unit
in israel got called up.

31:50.091 --> 31:52.093
God bless
america, huh?

31:53.595 --> 31:57.098
Listen, you find
yourself short on x,

31:57.098 --> 31:59.601
i know a guy.

32:00.602 --> 32:01.603
X?

32:02.103 --> 32:02.604
What?

32:02.604 --> 32:05.607
I'm trying to
do you a favor.

32:07.108 --> 32:08.610
And just so
you know,

32:09.110 --> 32:12.113
that bullshit
your future father- in- law
pulled over thanksgiving,

32:12.113 --> 32:14.616
he knew i had no intention
of going over there.

32:15.116 --> 32:16.618
He's trying
to save face.

32:16.618 --> 32:20.622
So he stoops so
low, he had his wife
lie to your mother.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.125
Whatever you need,
give me a call.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.127
Be good.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.584
The woman is
50 years old.

32:33.584 --> 32:37.088
Sometimes i just want
to scream in her face,

32:37.088 --> 32:41.092
"quit whining, no
wonder he left you!"

32:41.592 --> 32:44.095
Her supervisor looks
at her cross- eyed

32:44.595 --> 32:48.099
and i get a call at
3:00 in the morning.

32:48.099 --> 32:51.602
She wants to talk
about how her father
laughed at her

32:51.602 --> 32:54.605
when she fell off her bicycle
when she was seven.

32:54.605 --> 32:56.607
Does she call yo
ur emergency number?

32:56.607 --> 32:58.609
No, that's not
the point, elliot!

32:58.609 --> 33:02.113
Oh, these fuckin'
interruptions!

33:04.115 --> 33:05.616
I was raped.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.619
You have feelings of y
our own and who is listening?

33:08.619 --> 33:10.121
That's right,
damnit.

33:11.622 --> 33:14.125
I have to sit there

33:14.125 --> 33:17.628
and take care of these
people hour after hour

33:17.628 --> 33:21.132
with all
their problems...

33:21.132 --> 33:24.135
and some of them are very
real and very serious,

33:24.635 --> 33:26.637
and i'm sorry,

33:26.637 --> 33:28.639
i care,
i really do...

33:30.641 --> 33:32.643
but it's hard
sometimes.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.646
I just want to
say,"i hurt!"

33:37.148 --> 33:39.150
Good, sure.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.651
That's why
you're here.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.154
I'm sorry,
elliot.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.656
No need to
be sorry.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.161
You've been
through such trauma.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.164
It takes tremendous
strength of will

33:53.164 --> 33:55.166
and inner resource

33:55.166 --> 33:57.168
to soldier on as you
do at your work.

33:57.168 --> 33:59.170
Thank you,
elliot.

34:01.672 --> 34:04.675
I try,
i really do.

34:04.675 --> 34:07.178
It's just
hard sometimes.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.684
And patient
soprano?

34:13.684 --> 34:15.686
How's all that?

34:15.686 --> 34:20.690
He offered to
escort me to my car.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.694
I almost fell in
his arms crying.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.199
Oh, jesus christ.

34:34.205 --> 34:35.706
Chris.

34:35.706 --> 34:36.706
Paulie.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.208
Ralphie.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.246
You wanted
to see me?

35:16.247 --> 35:17.748
Yeah, tony.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.750
About what?

35:19.750 --> 35:21.252
About what?

35:21.252 --> 35:22.753
You know...

35:22.753 --> 35:25.256
to apologize.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.758
Oh.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.764
Sit down?

35:43.274 --> 35:46.277
I was doing
a lot of coke.

35:46.277 --> 35:49.280
I said some things and
i did some things...

35:51.282 --> 35:54.285
that i'm sorry for.

35:54.285 --> 35:56.787
It's not gonna
happen again.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.792
What'd you do?

36:04.295 --> 36:06.297
I was rude

36:06.297 --> 36:08.799
when you offered
me the drink.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.804
And i disrespected
"the bing".

36:18.309 --> 36:20.311
And the girl...

36:25.316 --> 36:27.318
that shouldn't
have happened.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.819
Like i said,

36:28.819 --> 36:30.321
i was doing
a lot of coke.

36:33.824 --> 36:36.327
But i gave
that up, and...

36:37.328 --> 36:39.830
end of story,
and...

36:42.333 --> 36:46.337
i'm sorry,
tony, okay?

37:03.354 --> 37:04.855
Anything else?

37:21.872 --> 37:22.873
Hey.

37:22.873 --> 37:24.375
What's up,
gi?

37:24.375 --> 37:25.876
Hey, gi.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.379
My wife made some
turkey sandwiches
if anybody wants one.

37:28.379 --> 37:31.382
I'm still a
little bloated
from thanksgiving.

37:31.382 --> 37:33.884
Thanksgiving,
1982.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.887
Fucking turkey,
it's like spackle
in my bowels.

37:36.887 --> 37:37.888
Nothing moves.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.391
Want me to run to rite aids
and get you some metamucil?

37:40.391 --> 37:41.892
Nah, i hat
e that shit.

37:41.892 --> 37:44.395
Maybe i'll try
one with lettuce
and cranberry.

37:45.896 --> 37:47.898
Ralph around?

37:47.898 --> 37:48.899
Not yet.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.401
Want me to
give him a call?

37:50.401 --> 37:53.404
Please, let's just
enjoy the quiet, huh?

37:53.404 --> 37:56.407
After decades of planning,
ground was broken today

37:57.408 --> 37:59.410
on the city
of newark,
new jersey's

37:59.410 --> 38:01.412
museum of science
and trucking, and
riverfront esplanade.

38:01.412 --> 38:02.913
Oh, hi, ralphie.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.915
C'mon in, he's
watching tv.

38:04.915 --> 38:06.917
...the project
was held up several times

38:06.917 --> 38:08.919
by political infighting--

38:09.420 --> 38:11.922
nothing, he
gave me nothing.

38:11.922 --> 38:14.925
Two seconds,
look, the fuckin
g esplanade, finally.

38:14.925 --> 38:17.928
We're gonna need our
own bulldozers to
take the money away.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.430
Not a thing, john.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.932
Not a thank
you, not an
apology, nothing!

38:21.932 --> 38:24.435
Calm down,
take it easy.

38:24.435 --> 38:27.938
He let me stand there
like a servant...

38:27.938 --> 38:30.941
scraping,
bowing!

38:31.442 --> 38:34.445
Cocksucker didn't even
invite me to sit down.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.447
It's posturing,
it's part of the game.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.449
Fuck the game,
he's going down.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.451
Are you fucking
stupid coming in here
talking to me like that?

38:40.451 --> 38:42.453
I don't give a
fuck anymore!

38:42.453 --> 38:45.456
I've given my life
to this thing

38:45.456 --> 38:47.958
and this is the
thanks i get?

39:04.975 --> 39:06.977
It's silvio dante
on the phone.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.479
You wanna
talk to him?

39:08.479 --> 39:10.481
Tell him i
'll call him back.

39:10.481 --> 39:11.482
They're my children.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.484
You seriously cannot be--

39:17.988 --> 39:19.990

39:49.019 --> 39:50.020

39:50.020 --> 39:52.523

amazon jungle in here.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.025

40:09.039 --> 40:11.542
The though
t of losing you.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.544
Grandpa,

40:13.544 --> 40:16.547
did he ever work for
somebody named trillo?

40:17.047 --> 40:19.550
He owned a
lumberyard?

40:19.550 --> 40:21.552
My father was
a master stonemason,

40:21.552 --> 40:23.554
he never cut
fucking wood.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.556
A contractor then?

40:26.056 --> 40:28.058
Built garden
apartments?

40:28.058 --> 40:31.061
There was somebody
named trillo, he had
seven daughters.

40:31.562 --> 40:33.063
I can't remember.

40:37.067 --> 40:40.571
I thought you were
gonna ask my advice
about ralph cifaretto.

40:45.576 --> 40:48.078
Got any thoughts?

40:48.078 --> 40:49.580
What else
do i have left?

40:51.582 --> 40:53.584
A real contremps you have
on your hands here.

40:56.086 --> 40:59.089
A good kid, but you never
should've put gigi in there.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.091
He's strong,
a good earner,

41:01.091 --> 41:03.093
well respected.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.095
Not by that crew.

41:05.095 --> 41:07.097
To them he's a ghibelline
coming over to butt in.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.100
They don't trust him,
they undermine him.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.103
On top of that,
you got ralph now
pissing in their ears.

41:13.103 --> 41:15.606
Any day you'll have a
mutiny on your hands.

41:17.107 --> 41:19.109
So, i take gigi out,

41:19.109 --> 41:21.111
what kind of message
does that send?

41:21.612 --> 41:24.114
That you're indecisive
and unsure of yourself.

41:24.114 --> 41:26.116
Exactly.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.619
Who the fuck would i
replace him with anyway?

41:29.119 --> 41:30.621
All good questions.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.623
Great, what's
the fuckin' answer?

41:33.123 --> 41:34.625
Who says
there is one?

41:34.625 --> 41:36.627
That's what
being a boss is,

41:36.627 --> 41:38.128
you steer the ship
the best way you know.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.631
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes you hit the rocks.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.633
In the meantime,

41:42.633 --> 41:45.135
you find your pleasures
where you can.

41:50.641 --> 41:52.142
How much longer,
skip?

41:52.142 --> 41:54.144
I gotta
take a leak!

42:10.160 --> 42:11.662
Holy jesus.

42:23.674 --> 42:26.176
What the fuck
are you lookin'
at? Call 911.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.181
I don't
feel a pulse.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.184
I'm so sorry.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.191
I'm sorry.

42:41.191 --> 42:42.693
Thank you,
tony.

42:43.193 --> 42:45.195
He was a
good man.

42:45.195 --> 42:48.198
Never said
a bad word
about anybody.

42:51.702 --> 42:53.704
Thank you,
tony.

42:53.704 --> 42:56.707
I'm so sorry.

43:11.722 --> 43:13.223
It's fuckin' awful.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.726
He's a young man.

43:15.726 --> 43:18.228
Heart disease...

43:19.730 --> 43:22.232
the silent killer.

43:22.733 --> 43:25.235
Hey, there are
worse ways togo.

43:26.737 --> 43:29.740
Even still, on
the pisciadood?

43:30.240 --> 43:32.242
Pretty fuckin'
humiliating.

43:32.743 --> 43:34.745
It's how
elvis died.

43:34.745 --> 43:37.247

43:45.255 --> 43:47.257
So, there'
s a vacancy.

43:47.257 --> 43:49.760
There's a lot
of business to do.

43:51.261 --> 43:53.764
You thought about
who it's gonna be?

44:28.298 --> 44:30.801
Terrible, it's a
terrible thing.

44:30.801 --> 44:33.303
Guy was in here
twice a week.

44:33.804 --> 44:36.807
