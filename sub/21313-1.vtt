WEBVTT

00:21.140 --> 00:23.847
Scratch. Wampum.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.809
Dough. Sugar. Clams.

00:28.900 --> 00:33.769
Loot. Bills. Bones. Bread. Bucks.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.349
Money.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.573
That which separates the haves
from the have-nots.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.689
But what is money?

00:42.290 --> 00:44.201
It's everything
if you don't have it, right?

00:45.080 --> 00:49.119
Half of all American adults _
have more credit card debt than saVIngs.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.547
25% have no savings at all.

00:52.460 --> 00:58.342
And only 15% of the population is on track
to fund even one year of retirement.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.256
Suggesting what?

01:02.100 --> 01:03.761
The middle class is evaporating?

01:03.850 --> 01:05.340
Or the American Dream is dead?

01:06.640 --> 01:09.359
You wouldn't be sitting there
listening to me if the latter were true.

01:10.110 --> 01:13.523
You see, I think most people just have
a fundamentally flawed view of money.

01:14.110 --> 01:17.659
Is it simply an agreed-upon unit
of exchange for goods and services?

01:18.240 --> 01:20.231
$3.70 for a gallon of milk?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.945
Thirty bucks to cut your grass?

01:22.030 --> 01:24.362
Or is it an intangible?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.701
Security or happiness. Peace of mind.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.376
Let me propose a third option.

01:31.710 --> 01:34.702
Money as a measuring device.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.792
You see, the hard reality is
how much money we accumulate in life

01:37.880 --> 01:39.677
is not a function of who's president

01:39.760 --> 01:43.594
or the economy or bubbles bursting
or bad breaks or bosses.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.551
It's about the American work ethic.

01:47.730 --> 01:50.187
The one that made us
the greatest country on Earth.

01:51.610 --> 01:56.559
It's about bucking the media's opinion
as to what constitutes a good parent.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.483
Deciding to miss the ball game,
the play, the concert,

01:59.570 --> 02:03.779
because you've resolved to work
and invest in your family's future.

02:04.830 --> 02:08.664
And taking responsibility
for the consequences of those actions.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.838
Patience. Frugality. Sacriﬁce.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.457
When you boil it down, what do
those three things have in common?

02:17.130 --> 02:19.291
--Those are choices.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.256
Money is not peace of mind.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.749
Money's not happiness.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.056
Money is, at its essence...

02:32.940 --> 02:35.522
that measure of a man's

02:35.650 --> 02:36.981
choices.

02:38.860 --> 02:39.895
Okay.

02:40.530 --> 02:43.192
Well, we're really just getting
started looking at, uh, interviewing,

02:43.280 --> 02:45.111
I guess you'd say, financial advisors.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.657
Mmm-hmm. Sure._
You're doing your due diligence.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.650
- Mr. Byrde, we don't know--
- Call me Marty.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.742
Marty, we don't know that much
about stocks and investing.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.489
Well, I kinda do.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.626
I do. I just don't have time
to do the research.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.541
--We wanna be comfortable

03:02.340 --> 03:03.386
Um-hum.

03:04.050 --> 03:10.683
Um, well, tell me, um... what are your...
What are your financial plans?

03:10.770 --> 03:13.762
Do you have a... a five-year goal?

03:13.860 --> 03:17.011
Yeah, we would like
to build out our basement, ideally.

03:17.110 --> 03:18.930
And we would like a pool.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.487
- We're not getting a pool.
- We're getting a pool.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.310
- He does this all the time.
- Pools are tricky.

03:23.410 --> 03:27.028
Very difficult to, uh, recoup your money
when it comes time to sell.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.783
As an investment... uh, they're poor.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.780
Marty, gotta be in the city at 4:00.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.869
-Yep.
-Leave in ten?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.871
_Yeah.
Hey, come on In, meet the Hunkins.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.337
-Oh. Hi!
-This is Liddell of Liddell &amp; Byrde.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.421
This is Bruce Liddell.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.580
The Hunkins are just interviewing
financial advisors, so...

03:44.680 --> 03:46.716
-Oh, so you didn't tell them?
-What about?

03:46.800 --> 03:51.225
Okay. So, we handle 73%
of Northwestern's entire surgical staff.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.847
- Wow. _
- Yeah, that's our appomtment.

03:53.940 --> 03:57.762
So, due to that level of business,
we're about to stop taking on new clients.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.399
There is an Edward Jones office on_ Wacker
I hear does a halfway decent job.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.519
Or...

04:03.610 --> 04:05.692
Marty, you tell me if it's not too late...

04:06.320 --> 04:09.983
then $5,000 would still
open an account here today.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.119
And we'd be happy to take
check or credit card.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.417
--Okay.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.240
Um... check?

04:18.340 --> 04:21.047
Great. Great.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.678
Nice to meet you two.
Marty, I'll see you in the car.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.749
Yep.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.923
Central location,
magnificent architecture.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.885
I know for a fact_ _
I'm the first person showmg this.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.722
- So you guys are in for a treat.

04:35.810 --> 04:39.473
Views of the Chicago River.
Room for expansion.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.312
-Oh, my goodness, this is perfect, baby.
-The lease options are--

04:42.400 --> 04:44.698
-Babe, not while I'm working.
-I love when you give me boundaries.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.907
Oh, thank God.
Marty, what do you think?

04:46.990 --> 04:48.230
Don't you love it?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.524
It's nice. Very nice.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.939
-It's nice?
-Yeah.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.248
Fucking nice?
I'm in that corner, you're in that corner.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.412
Twenty people working for us.
Boom, boom, boom.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.036
Two receptionists.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.199
What kind of windows are these?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.951
- The kind you see through.
- I don't know.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.206
I mean, this is southern facing, right?

05:03.300 --> 05:05.507
I mean,
depending on their performance rating,

05:05.590 --> 05:08.889
the cooling bill will be 15,
20% higher in the summer.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.301
Something to consider.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.887
You wanna go call
some clients or something?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.299
I think Marty and I need to huddle up.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.010
- Sure.
- All right.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.692
--Saw your computer screen.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.697
Wendy catches you rubbing one out
to that amateur backdoor action,

05:30.780 --> 05:32.862
she's gonna fucking crap a toaster, dude.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.531
What are you thinking?

05:34.620 --> 05:36.497
You and Wendy been together how long?
Twenty years?

05:37.120 --> 05:38.747
-Twenty-two.
-Twenty-two years.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.661
Holy Christ, those threads are stripped.

05:41.460 --> 05:45.123
-It's a long time.
-It's a long time. Liz... Liz...

05:45.210 --> 05:46.290
Nothing's off-menu.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.883
This girl's got a wink like a fox trap.

05:48.970 --> 05:50.631
This is your future wife
you're talking about.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.506
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.
-That is enough.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.465
Easy, settle.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.052
Marty Byrde, you're my best friend.
I love you, I do.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.189
But you're living
a tragically subdued life.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.515
Mmm-hmm.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.601
And how is it...
How is it we make the same bank,

06:04.690 --> 06:07.147
and yet I can see my place
in Trump Tower from here

06:07.240 --> 06:09.777
and you're driving a ten-year-old Camry
with cloth fucking seats?

06:09.860 --> 06:11.487
Nothing wrong with that Camry.

06:11.570 --> 06:14.323
And I do just fine, sex-wise.

06:15.870 --> 06:20.079
Says the man watching DIY porn
in his office, with clients present.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.989
Wow.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.702
Now, be honest. When was the last time
you were really truly happy?

06:26.800 --> 06:28.165
Oh, come on.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.330
-Come on. I'm planning up.
-Okay, okay.

06:30.430 --> 06:31.795
You got me. You got me.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.551
Financial advisor's not my dream job,

06:33.640 --> 06:36.017
but I am taking a fucking bite
out of the apple.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.089
-Are you?
-Yeah.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.933
Hey, check this out. Check this out.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.510
Liz and I went here...

06:41.600 --> 06:43.010
...last weekend. Amazing.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.685
Amazing. Look at this.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.726
-Lake of the Ozarks?
-Yeah. Lake of the Ozarks.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.482
Southern Missouri.
The Redneck Riviera, baby.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.902
I thought I was gonna hate the place.
Got there...

06:53.120 --> 06:54.610
...almost pissed myself.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.440
-Yeah?
-Seriously. This bad boy...

06:56.540 --> 06:58.861
This bad boy has more shoreline,
literally,

06:58.960 --> 07:00.609
than the entire coast of California.

07:00.710 --> 07:02.200
-Look at that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Come on.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.748
Every summer, five million cash-rich
tourists show up, descend on the place.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.162
And it's got everything.
Rich, poor, bass boats, yachts, condos.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.831
-You keep this. You hold on to this.
-This is mine?

07:11.930 --> 07:14.387
Yeah, you put that
on your vision board. Okay?

07:14.470 --> 07:16.506
This place, I'm telling you,
it's got everything.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.512
My point is, you can buy land
right down to the waterline.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.181
We invest, okay?

07:21.270 --> 07:22.806
Use it as an excuse
to get out of the City.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.767
Your mood improves,
probably your marriage.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.259
Decision, boys?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.679
- I think we'll take it.
- Nice.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.600
- No. What? No, we're not...

07:30.700 --> 07:32.065
We're not... We're gonna consider it.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.276
-We're not taking it yet.
-Mm.

07:35.030 --> 07:37.407
Sometimes, we don't think
we're gonna like something,

07:37.490 --> 07:38.991
but then you try it,

07:39.080 --> 07:41.708
and then suddenly you realize
that you're having fun.

07:41.790 --> 07:42.916
Think about your trampoline.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.321
I mean, your father and I fought
about getting that for years.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.581
And then, all of a sudden, what happened?
Next thing you knew,

07:47.670 --> 07:49.501
the two of us were doing backflips
out there with you.

07:49.590 --> 07:52.002
Mom, I don't want to go to the dance
and I'm not gonna have fun.

07:52.090 --> 07:54.172
Look, if he's just gonna stand around,
why make him go?

07:54.260 --> 07:55.887
It's a school dance.
Everybody stands around.

07:55.970 --> 07:59.019
-You just don't want me there.
-I'm trying to help you, retard.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.135
-Hey.
-You're the retard.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.552
-Hey. Stop it, both of you.
-We don't use that word. You know that.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.766
You know, maybe you should go.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.057
Then you can wear your Minecraft T-shirt
and take your spear.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.139
Oh, screw you.

08:07.230 --> 08:09.312
- Stop it, both of you.
- Put that back, please.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.186
Your brother is handsome
no matter what he wears.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.566
- Give me that.
- Gotta put yourself out there.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.309
Give me the clicker, please.
I was watching that.

08:15.410 --> 08:16.729
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I was.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.789
Give it to me and eat your dinner
and leave your brother alone.

08:19.870 --> 08:22.327
Why do you always take his side?
Not like you ever say anything to him.

08:22.410 --> 08:23.911
Not taking his side.
You're picking on him.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.319
Okay, okay. Just stop.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.832
-Can we reset this conversation?
-Yeah, let's do it.

08:32.670 --> 08:33.580
How was your day?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.176
How was yours?

08:39.970 --> 08:41.096
My day was very exciting.

08:41.180 --> 08:44.229
I went to Costco. _
And then I went and got groceries.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.393
And then I...
I dropped off the recyclables.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.563
And then I took Jonah to the dentist.
And then--

08:50.650 --> 08:52.732
Do not throw that out.
Your father might want it later.

08:52.820 --> 08:53.980
-You want it?
-No, thank you. No.

08:54.070 --> 08:56.197
- Okay.
- That's very exciting.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.487
Didn't you get, um, groceries on Monday?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.116
Um-hum.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.942
- I need ten dollars.
- What for?

09:03.040 --> 09:06.532
-There's a fundraiser for Hannah Lawson.
-Is she all right?

09:06.620 --> 09:09.339
- She has psoriasis.
- Oh. Jesus Christ.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.662
It's a disease, Dad. Like cancer, okay?

09:13.760 --> 09:14.966
No. Is it?

09:15.970 --> 09:17.176
It's itchy skin, honey.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.386
There's no cure.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.210
Right, let's save our money.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.758
I mean, if they're close to a cure
for flaky skin

09:23.850 --> 09:26.227
and your contribution's gonna put
a crack team of dermatologists

09:26.310 --> 09:27.891
over the top, then I'm gonna pony up.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.971
But until then, I'd like to save
my ten bucks. Okay?

09:30.060 --> 09:33.564
I am not calling you one,
but why are you acting so dickish?

09:33.650 --> 09:35.186
I mean, it is only $10.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.690
One day, you're gonna work for a living

09:36.780 --> 09:38.771
and you're not gonna like people
with hands in your pockets.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.986
Charlotte, get the
ten dollars out of my purse.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.866
-No, it's fine. Let her face fall off.
-It's...

09:42.950 --> 09:44.690
-It's ten dollars. For God's sake.
-What?

09:44.790 --> 09:48.248
She asked me for $20 last week
and $50 the weekend before that.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.787
She's 15 years old.
She needs to know the value of money.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.200
-Do you not agree?
-I agree.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.421
Your Consumer Reports came today.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.591
That's ironic.

10:06.310 --> 10:09.973
- Thank you for dinner.
- I worked hard at it.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.757
...some of the dangers,
and we wanted to look further.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.331
And while studies have shown
that potentially deadly side effects

10:40.430 --> 10:41.966
are extremely rare,

10:42.050 --> 10:45.929
fewer than 11 cases per 10,000 women
who use it for a year,

10:46.020 --> 10:47.385
families affected point out

10:47.470 --> 10:50.689
that the incidence of life-threatening
blood clots is still double...

11:07.200 --> 11:08.360
Do you want the History Channel?

11:08.450 --> 11:11.999
Mm-mm. Thank you.
I'm watching something else.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.159
I'm tired.

11:25.430 --> 11:26.886
You seem awfully quiet.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.226
Just got something on my mind.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.812
-Do you care if I go to bed?
-Mm-mm.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.271
-Good night.
-Good night.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.152
- Who loves his little girl?
- You do, Daddy.

12:29.660 --> 12:30.649
Good night.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.669
Yeah, I got it.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.501
You haven't done this before, have you?

13:28.760 --> 13:29.749
Why?

13:31.350 --> 13:32.419
Handsome.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.589
Clean.

13:35.770 --> 13:36.759
Fit.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.807
Let me guess. Your wife won't do
what you want her to do.

13:48.280 --> 13:53.695
If you were my man, working all day
so I could stay at home...

13:56.790 --> 13:58.075
which, uh...

13:58.170 --> 13:59.410
...let's face it...

14:00.380 --> 14:02.336
it was a bitch
when they were little, but...

14:03.050 --> 14:07.464
but now they're both teens
and in school all day.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.421
Private school, too.

14:11.510 --> 14:16.220
Even though you pay
a shit-pot full of state taxes

14:16.310 --> 14:18.847
and live in a top-rated
public school district...

14:20.060 --> 14:23.143
who's never missed a mortgage payment?

14:24.110 --> 14:25.566
Marty Byrde.

14:26.440 --> 14:31.901
Nice home on a quarter-acre
squared-off lot in the suburbs?

14:33.580 --> 14:35.821
Marty fucking Byrde.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.198
Putting presents underneath the tree
since 2002.

14:47.010 --> 14:50.628
Not only would I not cheat on you...

14:53.600 --> 14:56.842
- ...but I... I'd let you do...

14:58.680 --> 15:03.356
...anything... you... wanted.

15:07.190 --> 15:08.646
Do me a favor.

15:10.530 --> 15:11.986
Don't come too fast.

15:31.590 --> 15:32.420
Hey.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.297
You can't be beatin' off
in your car, baby. It's a workplace.

15:35.390 --> 15:36.846
Yeah. Thank you.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.496
-H_ello.
-Marty, it's Bruce.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.786
I'm at Hanson's.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.706
Trucking? Why?

16:04.790 --> 16:08.248
I'm with Senior and Junior.
I need you here, Marty. Now.

16:08.340 --> 16:11.582
Now? No, Bruce.
It's the middle of the night.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.251
Tell me what the problem is,
and I can try--

16:13.340 --> 16:15.968
Del. Del's here.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.380
Okay.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.720
Hey, Mr. Hanson. Hey, Bruce.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.721
Hey, Marty.
Del just has a few questions. He's--

17:07.810 --> 17:09.437
- Yeah? What's going on?

17:10.190 --> 17:12.852
Hey, Del.
Didn't know you were coming in town.

17:16.070 --> 17:18.231
-You look good, Marty.
-Yeah, thanks.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.827
Where's my $5 million?

17:22.290 --> 17:23.530
Your what?

17:24.660 --> 17:26.036
Your $5 million?

17:26.620 --> 17:28.076
-What's he talking about?
-Have a seat.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.623
Whatever's between you is your business.
Got nothing to do with me and my dad.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.507
Shut up, son.

17:33.590 --> 17:35.967
- We run a clean shop.
- Clean?

17:37.930 --> 17:43.209
Other than the $100 million in drug money
that you and your father collect

17:43.310 --> 17:45.471
and transport to these two gentlemen
to launder?

17:46.060 --> 17:48.301
Clean to you.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.641
Listen, Del. Wh...
Whatever money you're missing,

17:50.730 --> 17:52.561
I'm sure there's _
a perfectly good explanation.

17:52.650 --> 17:55.483
No. "Stolen." That's my word.

17:56.990 --> 17:58.230
- Sit down.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.150
Yeah.

18:00.620 --> 18:05.694
Mr. Del Rio.._.
I swear, we are not stealing from you.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.497
We log all of our weights.

18:08.580 --> 18:11.413
Check 'em. The numbers don't lie.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.956
Should tell that to him.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.627
From Chicago to Panama,
Moscow to Tel Aviv,

18:16.720 --> 18:19.883
Marty Byrde can make
$100 million in dirty money

18:19.970 --> 18:22.507
disappear like spit on a hot skillet.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.886
Mr. Rio? I have to pee.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.130
Of course.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.735
When I was nine years old,

18:39.820 --> 18:43.233
I started working
for my parents' grocery store.

18:43.830 --> 18:46.822
Wasn't a big store, but it fed six kids.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.991
We had four cashiers.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.661
Carlotta, our best...

18:51.790 --> 18:52.779
maybe 30...

18:54.210 --> 18:56.337
started there when she was 15.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.626
She was loyal.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.871
The kind of person you call "Aunt"
when you're nine years old,

18:59.970 --> 19:02.382
because she was always there.

19:02.470 --> 19:04.347
Always with a smile.

19:05.100 --> 19:09.139
And then one day,
my father's closing up...

19:10.480 --> 19:15.474
and he sees Aunt Carlotta
slip five dollars' worth of pesos...

19:16.730 --> 19:19.893
out of the till, into her pocket.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.060
He could not believe it.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.617
"Why? Why, Carlotta?

19:26.580 --> 19:29.242
If you needed the money,
why didn't you just come to me?"

19:33.710 --> 19:35.371
Carlotta was a proud woman.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.713
Not too proud to steal, but... proud.

19:41.970 --> 19:44.677
She had four kids, no husband.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.341
Her youngest one had asthma.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.306
Said she needed the money to buy medicine.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.437
So her boy could breathe.

19:55.810 --> 19:57.266
Cried like a baby.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.681
Swore she would never do it again.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.020
Begged my father not to ﬁre her.

20:05.820 --> 20:06.821
Begged.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.031
Mr. Hanson...

20:12.000 --> 20:15.458
what should my father do
with Aunt Carlotta?

20:18.170 --> 20:19.376
Five dollars?

20:21.470 --> 20:25.793
You tell her if it happens again,
she's gone.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.591
You put her on probation.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.129
Probation.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.766
I love America.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.009
Bruce?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.276
One mistake against 15 years.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.568
Training cashiers is a bitch.
I'd give her a second chance, Del.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.246
Marty, what should my father do?

20:56.580 --> 20:58.332
I know what this is.
I know what you're doing.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.160
This is an intimidation audit.

21:01.130 --> 21:03.758
Yeah? I mean, you think you can
just come in here unannounced

21:03.840 --> 21:06.718
and rattle some cages,
and someone's gonna admit to skimming?

21:08.260 --> 21:10.592
I mean, you're fishing.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.637
And, I mean, people steal. I get it.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.516
But you got a distribution chain
downstream

21:15.600 --> 21:17.431
that's run by meth heads and drug dealers.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.102
That's where you're gonna find
your Aunt Carlottas. They're not in here.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.522
We've been laundering money
for Mr. Navarro for ten years?

21:22.610 --> 21:23.736
That's right.

21:23.820 --> 21:27.449
The only thing you've done here is
you've involved a civilian. All right?

21:29.570 --> 21:33.074
And, you know, to be honest, this, uh...

21:33.700 --> 21:35.952
Dale Carnegie-Pablo Escobar ruse?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.530
I think that that's beneath you.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.836
-Come on, Del.
-Ruse?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.047
- Ruse.
- That's a good word.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.415
- Muchachos!

21:47.050 --> 21:49.257
-What the fuck?
-Put it down!

21:49.350 --> 21:51.750
-Jesus Christ!
-Whoa! Just slow down, Del!

21:51.850 --> 21:53.420
- What the fuck?
- Shit!

21:53.520 --> 21:55.385
- Liz!

21:57.730 --> 22:00.107
- Look, my dad had nothing to do with this.
- God, Marty!

22:00.190 --> 22:02.146
-It was Bruce's idea.
-Hey, shut the...

22:02.230 --> 22:03.265
Shut the fuck up!

22:03.360 --> 22:06.102
- He came to me. It was Bruce.
- It was Bruce.

22:06.190 --> 22:07.566
- It was his idea.
- Hey! Shut--

22:07.650 --> 22:11.108
Del! What have you done,
Del? Goddamn it, what have you done?

22:18.080 --> 22:20.787
Please, listen. Listen to me.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.498
- You don't wanna do this. Tell me...

22:24.590 --> 22:26.205
Goddamn it!

22:26.300 --> 22:30.043
He... he made a terrible mistake.
We will work for free!

22:30.140 --> 22:33.132
Please, please,
my dad had nothing to do with this.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.518
You know what I like about Chicago?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.556
All the Mexicans.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.768
Culture, the food, the language.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.817
The women. I feel at home.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.061
You know what I dislike about Chicago?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.355
All the fucking Mexicans.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.941
Might as well put up a sign that says,

22:51.030 --> 22:54.784
"Welcome to Chicago, drug hub of the US."

22:54.870 --> 23:00.115
FinCEN, DEA, ATF, FBI...

23:01.120 --> 23:03.327
all circling like buzzards.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.957
And where does all the drama come from?

23:08.170 --> 23:09.159
Hmm?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.922
Four sticky-fingered white men.

23:13.010 --> 23:15.808
--Del, he's my son.

23:15.890 --> 23:18.518
Please.
He made a terrible mistake.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.806
I can make this right.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.267
I swear to God, I can make it right.
I... I can make it right.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.932
A father shouldn't have to see
his child die.

23:28.570 --> 23:29.889
- Dad!
- No!

23:52.050 --> 23:53.426
How'd you do it, Bruce?

23:55.760 --> 23:56.749
Hey.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.847
Hanson's men picked up
the shipment of cash

24:00.930 --> 24:04.309
along with whatever legitimate load.
Air conditioners.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.517
Subtract the weight of the cash
from the weight of the trucks...

24:08.190 --> 24:09.566
We rigged the gas gauges.

24:09.650 --> 24:12.107
They'd read full
when they were five gallons light.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.275
How much, Bruce?

24:19.240 --> 24:21.151
Eight million over three years.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.501
Okay.

24:31.340 --> 24:32.329
Ready?

24:34.340 --> 24:36.171
Marty had nothing to do with this.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.459
This is all me.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.766
I need you to understand...

24:46.690 --> 24:49.682
I... I would've never done any of this
if I thought it would hurt you.

24:50.650 --> 24:53.892
- And I am--

24:55.110 --> 24:57.362
Let me just say goodbye to my kids.

24:57.450 --> 24:59.691
They're asleep. And I'll just...

24:59.790 --> 25:02.156
I'll just leave them a message, you know.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.321
And they're confused...

25:06.420 --> 25:07.819
...and worried about me.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.797
Hang on one second.
I'll just leave a message.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.792
Tell 'em that I'm going away somewhere
and that I'm gonna miss 'em.

25:16.130 --> 25:18.633
--They know.

25:22.970 --> 25:24.551
-Where are they?
-Huh?

25:24.640 --> 25:27.268
Are your kids in school? Summer break?

25:28.270 --> 25:29.396
What?

25:29.480 --> 25:30.856
Your kids, summer break?

25:30.940 --> 25:33.568
I don't want to do Wendy
in front of the kids.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.236
Wendy doesn't know anything
about what I do.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.448
I never told her about anything that I do.
Not once.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.992
Not once. _
You don't need to do anything to Wendy.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.360
- Are we ready?
- No, no, no. No, hang on. Hang on.

25:47.460 --> 25:49.496
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. One second.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.491
Just talk to me for one second.
Just hang on a second.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.250
Um...

25:59.800 --> 26:01.347
More shoreline...

26:01.430 --> 26:04.342
More shoreline than the whole coast
of California.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.510
Excuse me?

26:05.600 --> 26:08.228
This place right here
has more shoreline...

26:09.310 --> 26:11.767
than the whole coast of California.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.397
And apparently, every summer...

26:16.190 --> 26:18.567
Hang on, listen to me.

26:18.660 --> 26:23.734
Every summer,
the population of this place explodes.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.748
Tons of tourists.
Midwesterners from all over the place.

26:27.830 --> 26:30.492
Blue-collar, white-collar,
loaded with cash.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.036
Okay?

26:32.790 --> 26:34.667
That's why I got this brochure.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.796
- I gotta go.
- Hang on, one second.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.793
I got this brochure last week,
scouting businesses,

26:40.890 --> 26:42.426
and I brought it back
to talk to Bruce about it.

26:42.510 --> 26:43.636
And I was gonna talk to you,

26:43.720 --> 26:45.597
because I wanna put the house
on the market,

26:45.680 --> 26:47.136
and I wanna move down there
with the family,

26:47.230 --> 26:49.630
and I wanna do what we do down there.

26:49.730 --> 26:51.095
You're right about Chicago.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.142
You got the FBI and the ATF and the CIA.

26:54.230 --> 26:56.562
And they're all...
They're circling around Chicago.

26:56.650 --> 26:59.904
And they're tapping phones,
and they're monitoring bank accounts,

26:59.990 --> 27:01.696
and Ijust...

27:01.780 --> 27:04.112
We need a new hub. I need a new hub.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.736
Okay? This place...

27:06.660 --> 27:11.165
It's away from every single
law enforcement agency in the US

27:11.250 --> 27:13.741
and it's cash rich. Okay?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.048
Think about it. I mean, what do I do?

27:17.130 --> 27:20.588
I launder ten percent of what the cartel
does in the US? Right?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.887
And even if you piecemeal
five percent off to some other guy,

27:22.970 --> 27:25.097
you know, which I doubt you do,
but even if you do,

27:25.180 --> 27:27.671
that's 85% that's getting shipped
across the border into Mexico.

27:27.770 --> 27:30.512
All right? And how much of that
is getting seized?

27:31.100 --> 27:32.260
A lot. It's a waste.

27:32.350 --> 27:36.138
How much of it is getting siphoned off to,
you know, bribe the border patrol guys

27:36.230 --> 27:37.640
and-and the cops,

27:37.730 --> 27:40.028
and the politicians and the judges
and all that stuff?

27:40.110 --> 27:42.101
It's all going out the window.
Just give it to me.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.737
I want more than just the ten percent.
I want it all.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.229
And I wanna take it down there. Okay?

27:46.330 --> 27:49.788
What did these guys take from you?
Was it eight? Is that what they said?

27:49.870 --> 27:52.031
I'll get you that. I'll put that together.
I'll make you whole.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.782
You call it earnest money, okay?
I give that to you...

27:55.500 --> 27:58.708
but then I take me and my family
and we go down to the Ozarks,

27:58.800 --> 28:00.119
just like I planned.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.083
And I just start washing money.
Tons of it.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.468
Nothing but washed money.
That's all that matters.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.846
Come on. Come on.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.096
Five years,

28:13.190 --> 28:16.398
three years, and I'll launder twice
what we're doing right now.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.686
Five years...

28:18.980 --> 28:21.642
$500 million. I can do that.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.025
It's got more... more shoreline

28:23.110 --> 28:25.317
-than the whole coast of California.
-You said that already.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.327
- Here we go.
- Come on.

29:08.450 --> 29:11.283
$500 million in five years?

29:11.370 --> 29:13.691
- Hey.

29:18.130 --> 29:19.995
$500 million in five years?

29:22.420 --> 29:24.661
Yeah. No question.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.138
You have 48 hours to get me my money.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.881
-Okay.
-Cash.

29:32.850 --> 29:36.342
No financial instruments,
no wire transfer, no cashier's checks.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.898
-Cash. All of it.
-Cash. I understand.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.890
After I have my money...

29:42.610 --> 29:47.354
you have another 48...
to be on the road to these Ozarks.

29:49.450 --> 29:52.112
I want you to be ready
to set up shop within a week.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.406
Yeah.

29:53.490 --> 29:56.539
And, Marty...
when I drive by your house...

29:57.460 --> 29:59.837
there better be a "For Sale" sign
on your lawn.

30:04.550 --> 30:05.665
Come on.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.571
No. There is no choice here.

30:34.660 --> 30:36.571
Marty, stop.
We have to call the police.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.491
I want you to forget it, okay? I...

30:38.580 --> 30:40.491
Or do you want to just role-play it?

30:40.580 --> 30:42.832
Okay, I'm Detective Whoever The Fuck,

30:42.920 --> 30:44.797
and you're the wife
of the top money launderer

30:44.880 --> 30:48.043
for the second largest drug cartel
in Mexico. Go.

30:49.510 --> 30:52.001
I mean, come on. Police mean jail time,

30:52.100 --> 30:54.967
or witness protection program, at best,
if we even get that far.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.052
If we make it that f...
The kids and I are in danger?

30:58.140 --> 31:00.301
Well...
What do you wanna hear?

31:00.400 --> 31:03.016
You know,
people who drive trucks full of cash

31:03.110 --> 31:05.351
onto scales to weigh it
because there's too much to count,

31:05.440 --> 31:07.396
they don't exactly have a code of ethics
they adhere to.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.775
We're not going to the police.

31:10.070 --> 31:12.061
-Send Liz to the police.
-No.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.980
No, Bruce didn't come home. He's missing.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.945
-They'll find out he's dead--
-Liz is dead, Wendy.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.782
She's dissolving in a barrel
next to the one they stuffed Bruce into.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.537
Now here's what I'm gonna do.
Over the next two days...

31:23.880 --> 31:26.872
I'm gonna try to pull together $8 million
to pay back what Bruce stole.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.042
-What we're not gonna do is--
-Do we even have that much?

31:29.130 --> 31:30.290
Well, it's gonna be tight.

31:30.380 --> 31:34.339
I mean, after early withdrawal penalties,
I don't know, but I'm gonna try.

31:34.430 --> 31:37.467
What we're not gonna do, though,
is panic, okay?

31:38.390 --> 31:40.517
We're gonna prioritize
and we're gonna compartmentalize.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.842
And there's gonna be
a little bit of time management, okay?

31:43.940 --> 31:47.569
All right? Starting first thing tomorrow,
after we tell the kids we're moving,

31:47.650 --> 31:49.948
we're gonna call your friend Linda,
the Realtor,

31:50.030 --> 31:51.270
and we're gonna list the house.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.318
Then you're gonna call a moving company.
Then you and the kids are gonna pack.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.150
You can help 'em
or let 'em do it themselves.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.652
I don't really care,
but come Friday, after school...

32:00.210 --> 32:02.075
we're on the road, okay? That's it.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.205
And with the movers,
please, get three bids.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.915
The money's gonna be tight.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.967
- No fucking way am I going.
- Charlotte, you're going.

32:15.050 --> 32:17.302
-We're all going.
-Not me. I'm gonna live with Caitlin.

32:17.390 --> 32:20.132
The Ozarks. That's, like, woods and stuff?

32:20.270 --> 32:21.976
-Yeah, I think so, honey.
-Mom, what the fuck?

32:22.060 --> 32:25.973
Husbands and fathers,
and-and-and mothers and wives...

32:26.060 --> 32:28.437
they take new jobs, they relocate
with their families all the time.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.445
You know, this country was built
by Americans pursuing opportunity, okay?

32:32.530 --> 32:33.519
The pioneers, for one,

32:33.610 --> 32:35.612
-relocated once a day.
-You're a financial advisor.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.361
-A self-employed financial advisor.
-That's right.

32:37.450 --> 32:38.986
You decide where the opportunity is.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.036
Yeah, and I've decided
the opportunity is in Missouri.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.405
-Okay, we understand...
-It's simple.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.115
...that this is... this is upsetting.

32:44.750 --> 32:47.287
Believe me, I get how hard this is.

32:48.880 --> 32:53.294
But we're a family, so we are...
We're making this move as a family.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.041
We would prefer if you would...

32:56.430 --> 32:57.419
see it as an adventure.

32:57.510 --> 32:59.341
Yeah, well, thanks for the eggs
and the shit sandwich.

32:59.430 --> 33:00.510
Charlotte...

33:03.430 --> 33:04.590
I got her.

33:10.570 --> 33:11.639
You okay?

33:16.070 --> 33:20.734
Not some, all. Everything.
Liquidated, cash.

33:20.830 --> 33:24.118
$7,945,400.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.610
Sir, again, we don't keep
that kind of money on-site.

33:26.710 --> 33:28.666
You... you can't just have it wired here,

33:28.750 --> 33:30.957
and then come by the bank and withdraw it.
Not in cash.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.870
Whoa, whoa! Marty, stop.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.837
If the markets are spooking you,
let's slide it into mutual funds.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.467
No, I'll be back in six months
with twice the money.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.211
I'm not explaining myself correctly.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.346
Just because it says
the money is in your account

33:42.430 --> 33:44.011
doesn't mean it's really there,
physically.

33:44.100 --> 33:46.011
I know how the banking system works.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.648
That's why I'm calling you in advance
so you can get it.

33:48.730 --> 33:51.813
Your entire portfolio. Yeah, forget it.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.199
Ten percent penalty for early withdrawal,
plus another 32% in taxes.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.987
Mr. Byrde, there seems to be a disconnect
vis--vis large wire transfers

33:58.070 --> 34:00.118
and your expectations
about withdrawing it in cash.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.361
Sir, by the end of business today,

34:02.450 --> 34:06.363
you're gonna have close to $8 million
in four separate accounts at your bank,

34:06.460 --> 34:10.282
and I suspect that that puts you
in a woefully undercapitalized position

34:10.380 --> 34:13.872
relative to your obligations to the FDIC.

34:14.670 --> 34:15.750
Okay?

34:15.840 --> 34:21.039
So, you know, unless you're
the vice president of the one institution

34:21.140 --> 34:23.847
that is exempt
from the liquidity ratio laws

34:23.930 --> 34:26.012
that govern every other bank in America,

34:26.100 --> 34:29.399
I suggest you place a call
to the Federal Reserve

34:29.480 --> 34:31.050
at 230 South LaSalle,

34:31.150 --> 34:34.108
and you order yourself up
a shit-pot full of cash.

34:36.650 --> 34:37.856
Hey, Brenda, um...

34:37.950 --> 34:39.770
Yeah? Do you need help with something?

34:39.860 --> 34:42.579
This firm has been dissolved,
unfortunately.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.400
I'm sorry?

34:45.500 --> 34:49.288
The firm. It no longer exists, okay?

34:49.370 --> 34:50.997
Uh, but, um...

34:52.040 --> 34:55.544
you know, you were great.
All the way through.

34:59.510 --> 35:01.831
Marty's in business
with some very bad people.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.499
We need to leave town.

35:05.180 --> 35:08.843
Your husband, the financial advisor?
Mr. Consumer Reports?

35:12.650 --> 35:15.642
-Holy shit.
-We leave tomorrow.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.156
What?
Uh, wait a second. Wait.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.528
Are... are we talking about
run-for-your-life kind of leaving?

35:24.620 --> 35:26.440
Or a witness protection situation?

35:26.540 --> 35:28.531
Everything's on the table.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.860
Holy shit.

35:31.670 --> 35:34.707
Holy shit. Leaving... leaving for where?

35:35.920 --> 35:38.297
The Lake of the Ozarks.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.791
The Ozarks?

35:41.880 --> 35:44.849
I mean, good Lord...
what is that even like?

35:44.930 --> 35:49.469
I think it's where
camouflage is a primary color.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.930
His name's Gary Silverberg.

35:52.020 --> 35:55.604
He's a partner with McNeil-Roberts
downtown. Know him?

35:55.690 --> 35:56.759
Uh-uh.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.146
On the board of half a dozen nonprofits.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.856
Academy of the Arts,
Goodman Theater, Joffrey.

36:02.450 --> 36:06.272
He sees your wife at least twice a week.
Sometimes more.

36:06.370 --> 36:09.783
Either his place
or somewhere closer to yours.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.492
An HI Express, Fairfield Inn.

36:13.210 --> 36:15.030
The DoubleTree in Alsip's
where I tagged 'em.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.627
This "Sugarwood" right there.
What is that?

36:17.710 --> 36:20.508
Ah, you jumped the gun
asking to meet today.

36:21.260 --> 36:25.378
Normally, I transfer everything
from a working file to a folio binder.

36:25.470 --> 36:28.678
Table of contents, intro, summary.
Suitable for presentation, arbitration.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.012
Yeah, tell me what it means.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.931
SuganNood's her pet name for him.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.352
-As in, you know...
-Ah, right. I got it.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.102
-"Give me some of that sugar." Yeah.
-I got it. Thank you.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.271
Well, where is Marty now?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.238
He's paying back the money
that his partner stole.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.310
How much, I don't know.

36:46.410 --> 36:49.482
Well, if we're talking about
what I think we are,

36:49.580 --> 36:53.072
the government will try to attach
as much of that money as possible,

36:53.160 --> 36:55.492
freeze your assets
to force his cooperation.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.877
You need to get as much as you can
as fast as you can.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.540
Fuck.

37:03.470 --> 37:05.085
Fuck! Fuck!

37:05.180 --> 37:07.250
Hypothetically, scale of one to ten,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.557
how difficult would it be
for someone to disappear?

37:10.140 --> 37:11.516
You or him?

37:12.430 --> 37:14.842
- Careful.

37:14.940 --> 37:18.649
No. Just me. You know,
and the family. Family of four.

37:19.230 --> 37:22.734
New IDs, social security numbers,
credit cards. You could do it.

37:22.820 --> 37:25.448
For a while, anyway.
Then your money'd run out.

37:25.530 --> 37:28.943
One of your kids will get online sloppy.
Twitter, Instagram...

37:29.030 --> 37:32.488
Your wife has one Lemon Drop too many
with her new best friend, wants to share.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.866
Yeah.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.914
If you have a legal problem
I'm not aware of, don't tell me if you do,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.082
you could keep your identity,
leave the country,

37:42.170 --> 37:44.718
go somewhere
with no extradition to the US.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.506
--Depends on who's looking for you,

37:46.590 --> 37:48.171
how much money they have.

37:50.050 --> 37:52.098
Hang on. Hang on.

37:55.640 --> 38:00.725
I just got a text from my bank.
My wife emptied our checkings and savings.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.146
You got a gun?

38:07.700 --> 38:10.066
-No. What?
-Good.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.612
Silverberg lives in the Aqua Tower.

38:13.700 --> 38:16.658
Apartment 8003, 80th floor.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.746
What makes you think she's there?

38:21.170 --> 38:22.546
It's Thursday.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.316
Hi, this is Wendy.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.810
-Leave me a message.
-Fucking bitch!

38:59.870 --> 39:01.030
Hey, Gary?

39:02.710 --> 39:04.200
Hey, Gary, I'm back!

39:12.300 --> 39:14.712
Twenty-two years!

39:15.350 --> 39:17.727
Never cheated. Not once.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.599
And I had the chance...
more than a few times.

39:22.690 --> 39:25.261
But I never ever took it.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.238
Instead, I worked.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.811
Came home, went to bed,
got up, did it all over again.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.366
Not good enough, huh?

39:33.120 --> 39:35.020
And now you want to try to take our money?

39:35.620 --> 39:39.192
You want a divorce?
I will show you the meaning of ugly.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.499
You will lose.
I will lawyer up. I will dig in. I--

39:45.630 --> 39:46.745
Whoa!

39:53.590 --> 39:54.716
Whoa, man.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.800
Come on.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.209
Damn!

40:39.470 --> 40:40.767
Wendy?

40:40.850 --> 40:45.765
Why does Wendy have
a cashier's check for $29,650, Marty?

40:47.060 --> 40:48.641
You lied to me, Marty.

40:51.110 --> 40:53.066
She knows about our business.

40:55.030 --> 40:59.069
What kind of man isn't willing to lie
to save his wife's life?

40:59.160 --> 41:02.493
Was that before or after you found out
she was fucking the lawyer?

41:04.080 --> 41:05.206
After.

41:05.790 --> 41:06.745
Ouch.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.996
I bet you haven't even
confronted her yet, huh?

41:11.880 --> 41:15.043
Right now,
you're calculating the smart move.

41:15.130 --> 41:16.540
Divorce her...

41:18.100 --> 41:19.715
things turn ugly...

41:20.350 --> 41:22.511
...she holds what you've done
over your head.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.306
Live with the cheating,

41:24.390 --> 41:28.178
and whatever man you think you are
is eaten away, day by day.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.897
Or I take care of our Wendy problem...

41:32.490 --> 41:35.391
right here... right now.

41:36.530 --> 41:37.656
Your call.

41:45.830 --> 41:47.161
Marty, you there?

41:52.840 --> 41:54.796
What should my father do?

41:57.010 --> 41:58.079
Your father?

41:58.180 --> 42:01.422
About Aunt Carlotta. _
You never answered my question.

42:02.060 --> 42:05.018
What should my father do
about a woman who steals from him?

42:05.810 --> 42:08.347
A loyal woman. A mother.

42:09.230 --> 42:10.970
With him 15 years.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.562
What did my mother make him do?

42:18.700 --> 42:19.689
Fire her.

42:20.780 --> 42:21.769
Why?

42:23.580 --> 42:25.536
It's not the first time
she stole from you.

42:26.540 --> 42:27.575
What was it?

42:29.040 --> 42:30.701
It's the ﬁrst time you caught her.

43:39.110 --> 43:40.350
You're welcome.

44:19.070 --> 44:20.526
-Hi. Good morning.
-Mr. Byrde.

44:20.610 --> 44:21.895
Hi. What's this?

44:21.990 --> 44:23.526
-Good to see you, sir.
-Yeah, good to see you.

44:23.610 --> 44:25.612
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-No, thank you.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.782
Am I under duress? No. What are you doing?

44:28.620 --> 44:30.190
No. There's been-- No, stop that.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.700
There's been no kidnapping.

44:31.790 --> 44:35.282
I'm not wearing any wires.
Ijust... I have a, uh...

44:35.380 --> 44:38.247
a business opportunity that requires cash.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.329
-Sir.
-Yeah?

44:39.420 --> 44:41.752
There's no business opportunities
that require that much cash.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.883
-Not legal ones.
-Well, I agree to disagree.

44:47.050 --> 44:48.096
Where's my money?

44:48.680 --> 44:51.308
As we told you, we can't cover
that amount within 24 hours.

44:52.350 --> 44:53.476
Okay.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.391
There's two federal agents here.

44:57.480 --> 45:00.313
Which means you wouldn't take the chance
that there was a kidnapping

45:00.400 --> 45:01.480
and not have my money.

45:01.570 --> 45:04.391
So if you don't produce it immediately,
I'm gonna walk into that lobby,

45:04.490 --> 45:06.651
and I'm gonna tell these people
that I can't get my money out.

45:06.740 --> 45:08.617
And we'll see
how long that takes to go viral,

45:08.700 --> 45:11.157
and you get a good old-fashioned run
on this bank.

45:11.250 --> 45:16.745
And if I want to put all $7,945,400
into a hot tub...

45:16.830 --> 45:20.049
get buck naked and play Scrooge McDuck,

45:20.130 --> 45:22.200
that is 100% my business.

45:22.300 --> 45:23.961
Now, where's my money?

45:29.430 --> 45:31.307
The Great Depression.

45:31.390 --> 45:35.019
That's when the Lake of the Ozarks
was built. 1929.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.430
But you know all that.

45:38.020 --> 45:38.975
You're Marty Byrde.

45:40.020 --> 45:42.932
And Marty Byrde has been
planning this for a long time, right?

45:43.900 --> 45:45.026
How long again?

45:46.450 --> 45:47.565
Long time.

45:52.950 --> 45:57.614
Yeah, I'm short. $6,950. But it is not...

45:57.710 --> 45:58.950
-It's not a problem.
-What did I tell you?

45:59.040 --> 46:00.166
I've already sold that car,

46:00.250 --> 46:04.254
but I also have a minivan
that I haven't sold yet.

46:04.340 --> 46:08.879
And this... It's a Honda Odyssey. It's...
it's top-ranked minivan in the US.

46:08.970 --> 46:11.962
Blue Book on it is $27,000
and I get the cash--

46:12.060 --> 46:14.597
I'll buy the Odyssey from you for 27.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.843
So I owe you 20,000.
Take that from the cash.

46:17.940 --> 46:21.899
And I'll lease it back to you for...
say, 1,000 a month?

46:24.780 --> 46:26.566
Top-ranked minivan in the US.

46:28.740 --> 46:30.867
Okay? Good.

46:30.950 --> 46:36.536
Now I want you to take my $7,973,000
with you to Missouri...

46:37.210 --> 46:38.495
and clean it.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.871
-Clean it?
-Mmm-hmm.

46:46.050 --> 46:48.086
It's... That's clean. It's already clean.

46:49.550 --> 46:53.179
You want me to clean it? Again?

46:53.260 --> 46:55.421
You'd lose 15%.

46:56.770 --> 46:59.898
Another 25% in taxes. Minimum.

46:59.980 --> 47:02.301
That's not the point, is it?

47:03.650 --> 47:06.141
I have to see that you can do it.

47:07.110 --> 47:08.600
I'm torn, Marty...

47:08.700 --> 47:11.942
between intrigue
and thinking this whole Ozark thing

47:12.030 --> 47:15.818
is complete and utter
straw-grasping bullshit.

47:19.830 --> 47:21.957
But I'm willing to roll the dice.

47:23.710 --> 47:25.120
Because you're special.

47:28.090 --> 47:29.330
You have a gift.

47:31.010 --> 47:34.594
But if I think
that you're trying to fuck me...

47:36.600 --> 47:39.558
I will have to kill you... and Wendy...

47:41.060 --> 47:42.436
and Jonah...

47:43.230 --> 47:44.436
and Charlotte.

47:49.490 --> 47:50.730
And not in that order.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.309
Yeah.

48:03.170 --> 48:05.661
You know, Del, the other day you said...

48:06.840 --> 48:10.549
"Where's my $5 million?"
and Bruce and the Hanson kid took eight.

48:10.630 --> 48:11.676
Mm.

48:14.390 --> 48:17.177
You were right. I was fishing.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.511
I didn't know they stole a damn thing.

48:22.190 --> 48:23.646
And you killed Liz on a hunch.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.067
On a tell.

48:26.150 --> 48:28.562
I've been working with you and Bruce
for how long?

48:29.690 --> 48:32.443
You ever known him
not to constantly run his mouth?

48:58.180 --> 48:59.670
What's really going on, Mom?

49:00.520 --> 49:02.806
You know, Charlotte, it has been, um...

49:04.140 --> 49:05.892
a real hard few days, so...

49:07.190 --> 49:08.475
if there is...

49:08.940 --> 49:14.139
anything in here
that you can just combine...

49:18.080 --> 49:21.572
Okay. You're just gonna have to help Mommy
over the next few days, okay?

49:21.660 --> 49:23.958
-Okay. Okay.
-Just keep a really good attitude.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.496
And you have to trust us, all right?

49:25.580 --> 49:27.992
I know we'll work this out later.
I really do.

49:28.790 --> 49:30.121
-Okay?
-Okay.

49:31.510 --> 49:32.909
Thank you.

49:46.100 --> 49:48.603
- Went straight to voice mail.
- Hang up.

49:48.690 --> 49:50.726
-You want me to keep trying?
-No.

49:51.650 --> 49:52.856
Possible he ran.

49:53.530 --> 49:56.101
Changed his mind.
Took his chippie and left the country.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.816
Agent Petty? I think we got 'em all.

49:59.910 --> 50:03.744
Well, 18 bugs went in. I want 18 out.
My name's on the req.

50:04.330 --> 50:05.319
Yes, sir.

50:07.540 --> 50:10.782
-You don't seem too upset.
-It is what it is.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.119
Liddell was our in.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.758
You heard him. He would have been
a fantastic government Witness.

50:18.930 --> 50:21.637
Mexicans, Mafia, Muslims.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.803
We all want to believe
that these people are more than they are.

50:24.890 --> 50:26.596
And they're not. If they weren't...

50:28.190 --> 50:30.055
...dealing drugs,

50:30.150 --> 50:33.108
extorting businesses,
flying planes into buildings,

50:33.190 --> 50:35.431
they'd be cleaning toilets.

50:36.530 --> 50:38.020
They're not criminal geniuses.

50:38.110 --> 50:41.773
They're pathological liars
on the path of least resistance.

50:42.370 --> 50:44.656
Liddell was no different.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.030
Entertaining, though.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.877
Uh, I'm confused.

50:55.340 --> 50:58.173
Del Rio, Navarro, the cartel.

50:59.430 --> 51:03.343
Why... Why would we do all this
if Bruce was just "entertaining"?

51:09.940 --> 51:11.680
Where is Martin Byrde?

52:24.470 --> 52:26.882
- Where you going?
- Just gonna take a leak.

52:54.250 --> 52:57.663
Then in your life

52:57.750 --> 53:01.504
There comes a darkness

53:02.220 --> 53:05.508
There's a spacecraft

53:05.590 --> 53:08.093
Blocking out the sky

53:08.260 --> 53:10.888
I'm so sorry.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.893
- And there's nowhere

53:14.980 --> 53:16.607
To hide

53:16.730 --> 53:18.311
I'm so sorry.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.142
You run to the back

53:21.230 --> 53:25.599
And you cover your ears

53:26.320 --> 53:29.528
But it's the loudest sound

53:29.620 --> 53:32.578
You've ever heard

53:33.870 --> 53:36.623
And are we trapped

53:36.710 --> 53:41.044
Rag doll cloth people?

53:41.920 --> 53:45.219
We are helpless

53:45.300 --> 53:47.712
To resist

53:49.800 --> 53:52.928
In our

53:53.020 --> 53:59.858
Darkest hour

54:15.000 --> 54:16.240
All right, Dad.

54:23.050 --> 54:26.622
But it was just a laugh
Just a laugh

54:26.720 --> 54:29.792
Just a laugh
Just a laugh

54:29.890 --> 54:32.552
Even at this angle

54:33.470 --> 54:36.018
And so we crumble

54:36.890 --> 54:40.803
A ten-ton head made of wet sand

54:40.900 --> 54:43.562
This dread still covers us

54:43.650 --> 54:46.232
You gotta be kidding me

54:47.400 --> 54:49.777
The grass grows over me

54:50.740 --> 54:54.198
Your face in the glass
In the glass

54:54.290 --> 54:57.362
It was just a laugh
Just a laugh

54:57.460 --> 55:00.167
It's whatever you say it is

55:01.080 --> 55:03.548
A split infinity

55:05.380 --> 55:08.964
And in your life

55:09.050 --> 55:12.599
There comes a darkness

55:13.220 --> 55:16.633
And a spacecraft

55:16.730 --> 55:21.474
Blocking out the sky

55:22.610 --> 55:28.230
And there's nowhere to hide

55:29.530 --> 55:32.112
You run to the back

55:32.450 --> 55:36.693
And you cover your ears

55:37.370 --> 55:40.703
It's the loudest sound

55:40.790 --> 55:43.702
You've ever heard

55:45.090 --> 55:48.207
In your

55:48.670 --> 55:55.599
Darkest hour

56:19.120 --> 56:21.702
If you had another me

56:22.120 --> 56:24.031
If you had another me

56:25.340 --> 56:27.046
So dark

56:32.550 --> 56:34.711
If you had another me

56:36.140 --> 56:38.051
If you had another me

56:39.140 --> 56:41.051
Sweet time

56:46.150 --> 56:48.061
Sweet time

56:53.150 --> 56:55.061
Sweet time
