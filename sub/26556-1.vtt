00:02.828 --> 00:04.656
Last season on "Arrow"...

00:04.700 --> 00:06.615
This is my city!

00:06.658 --> 00:07.833
You want to stop me,

00:07.877 --> 00:09.400
You're gonna have to Kill me!

00:09.444 --> 00:10.619
No!

00:12.186 --> 00:14.144
So far ricardo diaz
Has been unstoppable.

00:14.188 --> 00:17.147
You want my help? I'm gonna
Need two things from you.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.212
- Mr. Queen, it's time.
- What is she talking about?

00:19.236 --> 00:21.543
Rene I thought you said
We had immunity!

00:21.586 --> 00:24.111
Watson You do, But only if
oliver Agreed to turn himself in.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.635
Oliver There is still work
To be done.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.985
I am the green arrow.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.523
- William, run!
- I can't run anymore.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.438
Yes, you can! Get up. Get up.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.223
Oliver, help!

00:49.266 --> 00:51.094
Oliver can't help you.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.227
Run now! Now!

00:54.576 --> 00:56.534
You're brave.

00:56.578 --> 01:00.277
Oliver queen took
Everything from me.

01:08.807 --> 01:13.464
I'm gonna enjoy taking
Everything from him.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
Morning, 4587.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.779
Beautiful day.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.586
Watch it, arrow.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.536
You're not gonna
Eat that, are you?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.519
Lights out!

03:03.313 --> 03:05.010
Morning, 4587.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.490
Beautiful day.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.249
Youyou're The green arrow.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.338
Wrong guy.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.818
But I saw you on tv.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.099
That beard threw me off
A little bit,

03:31.123 --> 03:32.342
But... It's Definitely you.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.126
I'm a big fan.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.389
"You have failed This city."

03:35.432 --> 03:39.001
Ok, I'm not that person
Anymore, all right?

03:40.524 --> 03:44.485
Look, I'll join whatever
Gang you're in.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.443
I don't care what I have to do.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.402
I justl need your Protection.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.925
I'm not in a gang.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.232
Then let me be your, Sidekick.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.451
Or your lookout or
Something. Please.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.497
Justl...

03:56.540 --> 03:58.194
How am I supposed
To survive in here?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.894
I don't know. Leave me alone.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.281
What the hell?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.556
I told you this
Wasn't over, didn't I?

04:55.599 --> 04:57.427
We waited a long time For this.

04:57.471 --> 05:00.343
Revenge is a bitch.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.040
We don't have To do this.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.477
But we want to.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.281
Guard Break it up! Break it up!

05:27.414 --> 05:30.417
Guard You've all had enough fun
For today, don't you think?

05:31.418 --> 05:34.377
You know the penalty
For being in possession.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.031
Of a weapon, mr. Turner.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.467
Take him to the hole.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.860
You're dead.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.427
When I get out,
You're a dead man!

05:40.470 --> 05:43.560
He planted that.
That's not mine.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.131
Man Deals can't miss, bro.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.002
Primo product, great price.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.527
Look, I'm on my way
Over now, ok?

06:04.494 --> 06:07.410
It can't be you. Aah!

06:07.454 --> 06:09.414
Nick Would you mind
Handling the incident report?

06:09.456 --> 06:12.459
I'd like to make date night
With curtis for a change.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
Go get the captain.

06:29.432 --> 06:34.089
4587, you pull that crap
Again from yesterday,

06:34.132 --> 06:36.178
I'm gonna make
An example out of you.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.441
Understood, inmate?

06:40.008 --> 06:41.879
Yes, sir.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.536
You got a visitor.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.502
You know the drill.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.343
You've looked better.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.346
I've looked worse.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.436
How are william And felicity?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.655
Still safe and sound
In witness protection.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.483
I've upped surveillance To 24/7.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.702
Since we spoke last week.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.269
Has the fbi made Any progress?

07:24.313 --> 07:27.272
No. No. Nothing.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.231
Watson says she won't
Stop looking,

07:29.274 --> 07:30.493
And neither will I.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.017
But, oliver, it's been
5 months, man.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.455
Five months.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.780
Maybe we need to think
About the possibility.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.849
That diaz is
Off the grid for good.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.721
I can't believe that.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.551
I know this
Must be so frustrating...

07:44.594 --> 07:46.683
Losing all sense
Of agency like this.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.163
Being out of control, I know,

07:48.206 --> 07:50.513
Is not your strong suit.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.515
I'm focusing on what
I can control.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.300
What's that?

07:55.344 --> 07:57.520
Keep my head down.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.088
Hopefully shorten My sentence.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.611
That's smart.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.875
I think that's a good play.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.704
But I worry about the toll.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.011
That's going to take
On you, oliver.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.491
Cuts heal, john.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.710
Not physically, bro.

08:13.754 --> 08:17.497
Keeping passive,
Not fighting back.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.673
Never been who you were.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.850
I've always done
What I had to do.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.507
Right now...

08:27.550 --> 08:29.857
This is what I have to do.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.250
Don't lose yourself
In here, oliver.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.774
I'll be ok.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.256
Damn it.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.736
What's up?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.520
We're supposed to go
Live on this app today,

08:41.563 --> 08:43.131
But something in the upgrade.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.002
Is corrupting The break. It's...

08:45.046 --> 08:46.569
Can I take a look?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.310
Be my guest.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.312
Yeah.

08:50.355 --> 08:53.445
Are you some sort of, Like,
secret tech wiz Or something?

08:53.489 --> 08:56.144
I just know my way
Around a computer.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.581
There you go.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.844
You are a woman of many
Talents, erin. It's...

09:00.888 --> 09:04.065
Saving the world one
Espresso at a time.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.590
This coffee's crap.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.506
I'll make sure to take
It up with our barista.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.247
You ready to talk?

09:12.290 --> 09:13.727
To a beat cop?

09:13.770 --> 09:15.685
I've already wasted
Enough of my time.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.774
I want to talk To your captain.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.689
You sure about that?

09:19.733 --> 09:22.692
Because officer anastas
Is a lot more patient.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.259
Than I am.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.088
Lady captain? Nice.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.743
Well, you have.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.615
Quite the list Of
allegations Against you?

09:32.659 --> 09:34.835
Fraud, racketeering,
Embezzlement.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.663
The key word being Allegations.

09:36.706 --> 09:40.710
Well, where there's smoke,
There's fire, mr. Stent.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.799
And in my experience,
Innocent men.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.777
Don't typically show up Bound
and gagged At my doorstep.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.107
Without reason.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.152
There's a reason, All right.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.807
The green arrow.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.393
Maybe you hit your head
A little too hard,

09:52.417 --> 09:53.680
But oliver queen is In prison.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.334
Then there's another
Psycho in green leather.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.206
Assaulting people with
A bow and arrow.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.122
There have been No vigilantes
in This city for 5 months.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.733
Looks like you got your Work cut
out for you, Then, don't you?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.866
Now, are you gonna Let me go,

10:05.909 --> 10:07.563
Or do I have to sue Your asses?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.913
Yeah. Just as soon.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.176
As officer anastas
Takes your statement...

10:15.179 --> 10:18.835
Very slowly.

10:20.794 --> 10:24.101
Rene Guys, guys, remember,
Always keep your hands high.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.060
That's your guard.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.670
Tony, yeah. In and out.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.106
Yeah, but keep your distance.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.673
Nice one, peanut.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.370
Isn't it bad To punch things?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.329
Ms. Lopez says
Gandhi wasn't violent.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.765
Gandhi ain't From the glades.

10:35.809 --> 10:40.901
Besides, self-defense isn't
About being violent.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.294
It's about being focused
And disciplined.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.601
So you can protect yourself
And the ones that you love.

10:47.298 --> 10:50.127
That's just 'cause There's no more
heroes To keep us safe, right?

10:50.171 --> 10:52.739
Hey, dad, my bag's leaking.

10:52.782 --> 10:56.960
Nothing a little
Duct tape can't fix.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
Are we ever gonna Get new stuff?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.703
This bag's Kind of gross.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.923
Still waiting to hit
That lottery, zoe.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.795
Besides, Gross builds character.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.711
Ten-minute break while I
Patch these things up.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.366
What's up with you, man?

11:11.409 --> 11:12.933
This class is dumb.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.519
Boxing's not gonna Win you
a fight In the glades,

11:14.543 --> 11:15.500
And you know it.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.893
Boxing's not about winning.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.523
It's about being focused
And disciplined.

11:18.547 --> 11:19.983
So you don't have to fight.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.159
You mean with, like,
A hockey mask?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.508
Come on, man.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.877
Everyone here knows
That you're wild dog.

11:24.901 --> 11:25.859
After that trial.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.295
And you just didn't
Punch people.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.079
I don't do that anymore.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.081
Yeah? Maybe you should.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.911
'Cause my family just
Got robbed last week.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.522
And the cops don't care
About us in the glades.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.612
So it's on us
To protect ourselves.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.007
Hitting these bags
Isn't gonna do it.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.234
You know, I ain't into
Blondes myself.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.453
Put that down.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.064
Slow your roll, Arrow.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.981
You wouldn't want This
conversation To get messy.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.939
You know I can just take
That from you, right?

12:02.983 --> 12:04.941
Well, that'd be A good thing.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.876
You see, it'd save us
The trouble of planting it.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.858
When we rat you out To yorke,

12:08.902 --> 12:10.773
Just like you did to turner.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.732
Now, I know you're
Trying to get back.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.690
To this pretty little face.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.562
You're probably counting
Down the days.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.521
Just tell me what you want.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.392
Yeah. Well, you see...

12:21.436 --> 12:23.525
You see, Me and sampson here,

12:23.568 --> 12:26.746
We've got a 3-man
Operation with turner.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.573
Side hustle.

12:28.617 --> 12:31.925
And, because of you,
We're a man down.

12:31.968 --> 12:35.145
So I think you
Should take his place.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.799
No chance.

12:36.843 --> 12:40.716
Now, here's two reasons
Why I don't believe you.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.152
Now, I bet you Really wish you.

12:42.196 --> 12:45.939
Hadn't have stopped merlyn
From killing me, don't you?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.858
See you soon, arrow.

12:57.124 --> 13:01.563
So I can sell cheap
To the culebras, no problem.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.478
Whatever you want, Mr. Stent.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.960
Heh. You got it. I got you.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.092
My man.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.486
This ain't no playground,
Kid. Keep it moving.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.227
Y'all sell guns, right?

13:13.270 --> 13:14.924
That depends.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.665
How much money you got,
Little man?

13:16.708 --> 13:18.667
Rene He's not interested.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.974
Tony You followed me?

13:21.017 --> 13:22.932
Yeah, I figured You would
do Something stupid,

13:22.976 --> 13:24.804
And it looks like I was right.

13:24.847 --> 13:28.198
Hold on.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.896
I know you.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.115
You're the one that dropped
A dime on oliver queen.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.031
Crazy dog
Or something like that.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.947
I don't know what You're talking about.
Let's go. Come on.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.778
Unfortunately for you,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.346
You just saw my whole operation.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.785
And that can't be good
For anybody.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.048
Get down.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.043
You ok?

14:30.086 --> 14:32.088
Was that the green arrow?

14:32.132 --> 14:34.786
I don't know who
The hell that is.

14:41.315 --> 14:46.363
We should turn around!
It's not safe.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.017
But is it impossible?

14:48.061 --> 14:51.020
No, not impossible,
But it's not very smart.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.935
Then how about I add
Another 100 grand.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.391
To the 200,000
I've already paid you?

14:54.415 --> 14:56.896
Most people would pay
That kind of money.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.854
To stay away from here.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.336
This place must be very
Important for you.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.077
It's not the place.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.993
It's the person I'm
Hoping to find there.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.053
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.708
Thanks for your help
The other day.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.144
Yeah, it was nothing.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.319
It was more Than nothing.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.278
The app's number one
Thanks to your genius.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.063
Well, I'm pretty
Sure I just touched.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.152
Somebody's snotty Snot rag,

15:36.196 --> 15:38.285
So I am also living The dream.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.722
Ha ha. Well, I hope I'm
Not one of those customers.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.158
That you secretly
Complain about.

15:42.202 --> 15:45.074
You? No. You're Polite and nice.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.226
And your hygiene is Fairly on
point From what I can tell.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.948
The bar seems pretty low.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.882
Yeah. You should Work here a
month, you Might change your mind.

15:50.906 --> 15:55.215
You could always... I don't
knowchange My mind over dinner?

15:55.258 --> 15:59.349
Unless if that just put me
On your creepy customer list.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.611
You're asking me out.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.004
And now I'm regretting it.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.788
No. I mean, I'm
Flattered and everything,

16:03.832 --> 16:06.878
Because, like,
"Whoa. Still got it!"

16:06.922 --> 16:09.055
Not interested? II get it.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.275
No, you definitely Don't get it.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.104
Bethany snow on tv Breaking news
out Of star city this morning.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.150
As the d.A.'s office
Is set to comment.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.979
On growing speculation
That the vigilante known.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.459
As the green arrow Has returned.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.984
For an official statement
From the district attorney,

16:25.027 --> 16:26.420
We go live to city hall.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.050
- Are the rumors true?
- Is the green arrow really back?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.858
Did oliver queen Escape?

16:29.901 --> 16:32.165
Do you have any idea
Who's under that mask?

16:32.208 --> 16:33.905
We have reason to believe.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.257
That a vigilante impersonating
The green arrow is out there.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.868
While we're still pursuing leads
As to the identity.

16:39.911 --> 16:44.568
Of this unknown assailant, we
Can tell you with 100% certainty.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.006
That he is not oliver queen.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.485
This is someone new.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.270
You said, "Assailant."

16:50.313 --> 16:51.725
Does that mean city hall
Considers this new green arrow.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.881
A threat?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.535
To the rule of law? Absolutely.

16:54.578 --> 16:58.060
Star city continues to employ
A zero-tolerance policy.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.281
Against any and all acts of
Vigilantism.

17:02.847 --> 17:06.589
Anyone found committing or
Aiding and abetting these acts.

17:06.634 --> 17:11.247
Will be prosecuted to
The fullest extent of the law.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.162
Rene Think she's full of crap?

17:13.205 --> 17:15.208
You really have To ask me that?

17:15.251 --> 17:16.818
You done giving Your statement?

17:16.861 --> 17:19.342
Green guy with A bow and arrow.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.214
Takes down a weapons deal
And saves my ass.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.058
If you ask me, you should
Be helping this guy,

17:24.086 --> 17:25.348
Not hunting him down,

17:25.392 --> 17:27.175
Especially with diaz
Still out there.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.178
Diaz has been gone For months,

17:29.222 --> 17:30.547
And the fbi still has
Its eye on us.

17:30.571 --> 17:33.052
So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

17:33.095 --> 17:35.228
And, believe me, I do...

17:35.271 --> 17:37.186
Taking a hard-line stance
Was the right play,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.362
Because if agent watson
Even so much as suspects.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.103
We have something to
Do with this...

17:41.147 --> 17:42.539
Our immunity goes adios.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.387
That's right. And that's
Why we have got to find.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.369
This green arrow wannabe
And shut him down.

17:46.413 --> 17:50.243
Rene, we all agreed,
For better or for worse,

17:50.286 --> 17:51.655
We were not gonna go out
As vigilantes.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.029
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.249
Ok, so we're supposed
To just ignore.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.729
The rising crime rate
And do nothing about it?

17:58.773 --> 18:01.123
Actually, I think Risking
my officers Every day.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.777
Fighting to maintain
Law and order is.

18:02.820 --> 18:03.908
Doing something About it.

18:03.952 --> 18:06.085
I... I get that, d.,

18:06.128 --> 18:08.913
But oliver asked us To carry on.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.133
So whoever's behind
That mask is doing.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.874
What we're supposed To be doing.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.832
But he's not
Helping the problem.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.139
Actually, he's Making it worse.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.924
Rene, I'm not saying.

18:19.968 --> 18:22.231
That we can't still be
Heroes to this city.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.581
We just have to do it In a
little bit of A different way.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.412
So where you at
Finding this wannabe?

18:29.456 --> 18:32.285
Well, we retrieved a few
Arrows from the scene,

18:32.328 --> 18:34.504
But forensics still
Turned up empty.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.810
But what about the perp?

18:35.853 --> 18:38.291
Any pattern as to how he's
Selecting his targets?

18:38.334 --> 18:40.293
This weapons dealer Has a
rap sheet 12 feet long.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.903
He was an obvious mark.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.383
But this first guy... Stent...

18:43.426 --> 18:45.361
I still haven't Figured out
how he fits Into the puzzle.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.952
You don't think he's Innocent.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
This guy? Hell, no.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.912
But his rap sheet's Only clean.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.392
Because he paid
To make sure it was.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.934
Well, it looks like you
Might have to take.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.240
A deep dive through
His financials.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.136
Yeah. But I can't exactly.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.461
Subpoena his records
Based on a hunch.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.227
Who said anything about
A subpoena?

19:01.270 --> 19:02.793
I really miss this, guys.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.318
Not that I don't like Being
the head of r&d At a.R.G.U.S.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.234
It has better benefits, As in
there are Actually benefits.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.844
I just miss the team.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.324
John Less talking, More typing.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.997
Right! Sorry. It should
Only be a couple of minutes.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.738
Before I'm in, Which felicity
could Beat one-handed.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.285
Miss her.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.828
Dinah I really appreciate
The assist here, you guys.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.506
You especially, john.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.440
I know you've been In some hot
water here At a.R.G.U.S.,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.007
Burning so many of their
Resources going after diaz.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.728
Well, lyla's down
At hq right now,

19:24.772 --> 19:26.339
Trying to smooth Things over.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.302
Besides, I want to get
this Green arrow imposter.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.994
Off the streets As bad as you.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.494
I don't want watson
Thinking that oliver.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.998
Set this in motion
In some type of way.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.913
There's enough Trouble as it is.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.089
How's he holding up?

19:39.613 --> 19:41.484
He's surviving.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.052
Curtis And that's a bingo.
Dinah What did you find?

19:44.095 --> 19:45.290
Curtis How stent's been
Making his money.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.186
And it's not from
Defrauding pensions.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.275
He's been peddling
Black-market arms.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.514
What kind of dumbass Leaves his
entire Criminal enterprise online?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
He was actually
Pretty smart about it.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.237
He kept himself clean,
Off the radar,

19:55.281 --> 19:58.458
Activities washed through
A series of shell corporations.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.199
I just happen
To be smarter. Boo-ya.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.785
So this is how the
Targets are connected.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.811
Stent supplied The
weapons, Medina sold them.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.050
The vigilante's trying To shut
down stent's Whole network.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.642
Yeah. And according To this
text exchange, He's panicked.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.620
Stent's trying To sell the
rest of His inventory off.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.298
In a huge buy tonight.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.213
Do we have A location?

20:14.256 --> 20:15.605
Not until an hour
Before the buy.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.259
I'll keep you guys posted.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.696
That's where we'll find
Our green arrow wannabe.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.309
Curtis So, any guesses
On who this might be?

20:23.352 --> 20:26.007
Well, my money was on john.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.313
Whoever it is,

20:27.356 --> 20:29.837
They won't be hiding
Under the hood for long.

20:32.492 --> 20:37.061
If you don't hear from me in
A week, I'm not coming back.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.628
I hope you do.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.804
You know, you pay me
A lot of money to do.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.806
Very stupid things.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.505
Always a pleasure.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.683
This food isn't as bad as
I thought it'd be...

21:33.727 --> 21:36.207
You can't sit here.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.732
It's just like high school.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.951
I don't really know how
To be much clearer.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.084
Than I've been being.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.304
Go away.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.846
So what do you think
About your replacement?

21:46.870 --> 21:49.133
It's got to bug you there's
A new guy that can do.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.571
All the things that you
Can't do anymore.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.703
Ok. Just because I have
decided To let you sit here.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.097
Doesn't mean that we're
Having a conversation.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.707
You understand?

21:59.405 --> 22:03.539
- You ready to hustle?
- No.

22:03.583 --> 22:07.630
Listen, if you try to
Leverage my family ever again,

22:07.674 --> 22:10.329
I will expose whatever
It is you have going on.

22:10.372 --> 22:14.071
To every single guard In here.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.595
Disappointed to hear that.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.382
We'll just have to try
This a different way.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.210
This your new friend?

22:22.253 --> 22:25.431
It's nothing To do with him.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.389
- It is now.
- I didn't do anything.

22:28.695 --> 22:31.567
Do you want to come
With us now, queen?

22:34.048 --> 22:35.179
No.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.398
Oliver.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.226
I can't help you.

22:38.269 --> 22:41.098
Inmate Oliver... Don't.

22:41.142 --> 22:45.538
Don't. Pleaseuh!!

23:02.990 --> 23:04.992
Looking pretty crazy Out there.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.559
I wanted everyone Ready to move.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.256
The second curtis
Has a location.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.040
With any luck, we'll
Establish a perimeter.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.607
And gain some lead time.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.914
And if that vigilante Shows up?

23:13.957 --> 23:15.568
Then we take him Down, too.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.439
I still don't think
You should do that.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.876
I thought we Settled this, rene.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.575
For the last few months,
All I kept hearing is.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.359
How scared my kids at
The center were.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.667
And then this green arrow
Wannabe shows up,

23:27.710 --> 23:29.756
And they have hope again.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.714
So, to me, that's worth
A hell of a lot more.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.587
Than our immunity deal,
Rule of law,

23:34.630 --> 23:37.416
Whatever the hell crap
Laurel said.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.592
Sometimes people just need
Something to believe in.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.550
Right. I get it, rene.
I really do.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.770
But how do you know you
Can believe in this guy?

23:43.813 --> 23:45.511
You don't know
What his motives are.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.749
You don't even know Who he is.

23:46.773 --> 23:49.210
I know he could've let
Me die, and he didn't.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.125
That's good enough for me.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.606
Yeah? You sure He saved you?

23:53.649 --> 23:54.713
Or were you just not His target?

23:54.737 --> 23:56.652
Because there's a big,
Big difference.

24:02.571 --> 24:03.703
Curtis?

24:03.746 --> 24:05.356
The buy's going down In an hour.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.489
Old manufacturing plant
By the wharf.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.644
You arrest That vigilante, d.,

24:12.668 --> 24:14.670
You're making A big mistake.

24:14.714 --> 24:18.587
No, rene. I'm doing my job.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.731
Felicity...

24:31.774 --> 24:34.255
Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you?

24:34.298 --> 24:35.648
I couldn't sleep.

24:35.691 --> 24:36.953
Everything ok?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.912
I guess.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.696
How was school today?

24:40.740 --> 24:42.611
The same. It sucked.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.613
Well, did you at least
Crush your geometry test?

24:44.657 --> 24:49.183
Yeah. I just miss My old school.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.272
And I miss old my job.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.753
I really, really miss Your dad.

24:53.796 --> 24:54.928
Me, too.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.408
At least we still have
Each other, right?

25:00.063 --> 25:01.978
How much longer do we
Have to stay here for?

25:03.937 --> 25:05.982
I don't know.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.577
Are you ok?

25:37.361 --> 25:39.102
What do you care?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.845
I'm not gonna Survive in here.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.674
Yeah, you will. You'll be fine.

25:45.718 --> 25:48.808
Youyou just left Me to die.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.592
I...

25:50.636 --> 25:53.029
I knew that they
Didn't want to kill you.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.683
Because they...

25:54.727 --> 25:57.599
I knew that they
Were coming after me.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.732
So you just let them
Beat the crap out of me?

25:59.775 --> 26:03.649
I'm on the guards' radar.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.955
After what happened
The other day.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.609
And I...

26:09.742 --> 26:11.613
I get another strike Against me,

26:11.657 --> 26:13.659
And I'm back To square one,

26:13.702 --> 26:16.052
And I want to get
Back to my family.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.706
I can't...

26:17.750 --> 26:19.752
I can't do that to them.

26:21.188 --> 26:24.495
I have family, too. Did
You ever think about that?

26:26.019 --> 26:30.589
I mean, I shouldn't
Even be in here.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.636
I was wrongfully
Accused of murder.

26:34.680 --> 26:38.422
And that's what
The city's like now.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.511
There's no justice.

26:40.555 --> 26:43.123
Just keep your head
Down, you'll be fine.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.779
Thatthat's your advice?

26:48.519 --> 26:50.957
All this time, I thought
You had a raw deal,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.394
Like I did.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.743
But it makes sense now.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.919
Why there's a new
Green arrow out there.

26:56.963 --> 27:00.575
Because the old one is A coward.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.796
Yorke Lights out!

27:07.974 --> 27:11.630
Stent There's close To $1
million worth Of product here.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.501
All yours for 400k.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.285
What's the catch?

27:15.329 --> 27:16.765
I got burned out
On the business.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.594
I decided to liquidate
For my mental health.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.732
Stent's about to make
The exchange.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.647
Should we move in?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.431
We can make this bust
In our sleep.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.608
I'm waiting For the vigilante.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.441

Cryptocurrencies,

27:40.484 --> 27:42.095

Full of money? No, thanks.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.028
Rough night, 4587?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.638
I have reason to believe.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.292
That my family
Has been attacked.

33:10.336 --> 33:13.339
Please allow me to make
A phone call.

33:13.382 --> 33:16.124
You know you don't have
Phone privileges.

I should have been There.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.302
How could you have been?

34:03.345 --> 34:05.173
The only reason That I'm here is.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.480
To keep You and william safe.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.047
Yeah. I know.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.962
I need you to tell john.

34:25.324 --> 34:28.849

In cambridge.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.197

34:30.242 --> 34:32.679
You're not Going with him?

34:32.722 --> 34:35.203

34:35.246 --> 34:37.639
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, oliver.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.208
I'm done being a person
Who doesn't fight back.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.862
Diaz broke in, and all
I could think about was.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.212
Protecting william.

34:44.255 --> 34:47.215
I tried, And I couldn't do it.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.349
If a.R.G.U.S. Hadn't gotten
There when they did...

34:50.391 --> 34:53.264
Do you know what it Feels like.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.266
Not being able
To protect your family?

34:55.310 --> 34:59.271
I have lived With that
feeling Every second.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.099
Since I stepped
In here, felicity.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.926
Don't...

35:02.970 --> 35:05.059
Don't tempt that,

35:05.103 --> 35:07.801
Please.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.020
Please.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.677

35:14.721 --> 35:15.939
To witness Protection.

35:15.983 --> 35:19.465
No. I won't.

35:19.508 --> 35:23.686
You don't get to decide
This time, oliver.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.300
I love you,

35:28.343 --> 35:31.041
And I will always...

35:31.085 --> 35:35.220

Understand that.

The lottery or something?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.410
Nah. I just got some help
From somebody looking out.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.519
But I thought you said
The old stuff builds character.

36:37.543 --> 36:40.633
Thatthat was Before I knew
we Would get newer stuff.

36:41.677 --> 36:42.852

36:47.553 --> 36:49.511
We're gonna be ripping
These bags apart.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.343
Rene Hey. What's up, d.?

36:55.387 --> 36:57.737
What brings you To these parts?

36:57.780 --> 37:02.263
Well, a couple of Mom and pop
shops Called the precinct.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.396
They said they opened up
To find cash waiting.

37:04.439 --> 37:07.312
It seems like 15 other
Hard-up businesses.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.010
From the glades also got The same
exact amount That went missing.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.577
From the weapons buy
The other night.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.536
So, you wouldn't happen
To know anything about that,

37:14.580 --> 37:15.624
Would you?

37:15.668 --> 37:17.931
No. No. I can't...

37:17.974 --> 37:20.020
But it does sound like
The work of a hero, though.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.631
That's what it Feels like.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.285
I should be arresting you.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.026
For the crap you pulled
The other night.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.550
Do you have any idea The position
you're Putting me in, rene?

37:28.594 --> 37:30.291

D., all right?

37:30.335 --> 37:32.250

And you know it.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.514
No, I don't.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.448

Faith I'm willing to take.

You know, I am working So hard
to restore The city's faith.

37:40.432 --> 37:43.565

37:46.307 --> 37:48.657
I will not hesitate
To lock you up.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.444
Are you serious, d.?

37:52.487 --> 37:54.010
I just want you to think

For these kids and for zoe.
