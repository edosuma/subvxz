18:52.732 --> 18:56.066
I count four dozen unique
handprints moving in sync.

18:56.068 --> 19:00.104
Four squadrons. This was
a choreographed onslaught.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.139
You think Darkseid's
army has returned?

19:02.141 --> 19:06.210
No, doesn't fit.
Walk us through your assault.

19:20.091 --> 19:24.294
Kinda cool, like watching
a 3-D movie, with no glasses.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.197
- (GRUNTING)
- Freeze. Observations?

19:27.199 --> 19:31.635
They avoided his gaze,
kept to the shadows,
used their element.

19:31.637 --> 19:35.506
- These were warriors.
- Agreed. Resume.

19:38.209 --> 19:42.046
(LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
That looked like
it hurt all over again.

19:42.048 --> 19:46.216
Who has the force to knock
a quarter ton of metal
to the ground under water?

19:48.319 --> 19:50.688
Freeze. That's a barrel roll.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.323
These guys are skilled
in 360-degree combat.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.026
Agreed. Note
the sound sensitivity.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.396
Makes sense.
Sound travels 4.3 times
faster under water.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.998
(COUGHING) Kiss ass!

20:01.000 --> 20:03.100
Whatever, Mr. Barrel Roll.

20:04.035 --> 20:05.703
Resume.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.771
(GRUNTING)

20:08.339 --> 20:09.540
(GROANING)

20:10.542 --> 20:11.809
Freeze.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.377
So that's what you look like.

20:14.345 --> 20:15.746
Magnify.

20:18.316 --> 20:21.085
Gills? As in... mermaids?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.320
As in Atlantis.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.888
Where is this?

20:33.031 --> 20:35.833
These carvings,
I recognize them

20:35.835 --> 20:38.736
from the <i> Tales of Atlantis</i>
I read as a girl.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.771
It sunk into the ocean,

20:40.773 --> 20:43.741
but its people
were saved by the magic
of the King's trident

20:43.743 --> 20:46.944
which turned them irreversibly
into creatures of the sea.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.445
That's a fairy tale.

20:49.114 --> 20:50.848
I believe you.

20:50.850 --> 20:54.118
Well, of course
he does. (KISSING)

20:55.720 --> 20:57.921
So, where is it?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.390
The location
has been lost to time.

21:00.392 --> 21:04.728
What does a mythical,
mystical undersea world
need with missiles?

21:04.730 --> 21:07.931
And I so dare you
to say that five times fast.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.033
Obviously they
plan to attack us.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.736
Any way you look at this,
it's bad.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.872
Uh, terrible idea,

21:14.874 --> 21:17.741
I saw an Atlantis show
on the whatsit channel,
with this professor.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.543
Maybe he can help us.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.378
We're at S.T.A.R. Labs,

21:21.380 --> 21:24.581
the greatest minds
on the planet
are right next door.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.817
Jeez, I said, "terrible idea."

21:27.886 --> 21:30.254
Maybe it's not.

21:30.256 --> 21:33.323
Dr. Steven Shin,
I'm scrubbing
through his research.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.293
He's got some pretty
out-there theories about
the existence of Atlantis.

21:36.295 --> 21:40.497
Superman and I will
go question Dr. Shin.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.900
When did we vote
him team leader?

21:44.969 --> 21:46.904
What should the rest of us do?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.472
Find Atlantis.

22:01.019 --> 22:05.789
Now that the plans have been
set in motion, Manta,
there is no turning back.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.792
You were right to strike
first and strike
quickly, My Liege.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.195
My mother will not
see it as such.

22:11.197 --> 22:15.299
She has yet to grasp
the dangers of the surfaces
you have, Prince Orm.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.034
Soon she'll have no choice.

22:27.445 --> 22:29.179
She's been waiting for you.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.849
Someday, Mera,
I will be on throne

22:31.851 --> 22:34.484
and you will guard my body.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.855
Let's hope I fall in battle
before that day arrives.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.792
Perhaps you will.

22:52.403 --> 22:54.972
(KISSES) Mother.

22:54.974 --> 23:00.143
Your transparent aggression
towards the surface world has
left Atlantis exposed, Orm.

23:00.145 --> 23:03.413
-Do you deny it?
-That ship would have
discovered us.

23:03.415 --> 23:07.251
Nonsense! Our magic
continues to protect us.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.454
We are myth.
They doubt our very existence.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.923
So we hide?

23:12.925 --> 23:16.360
Mother, every day
the surface dwellers
grow stronger.

23:16.362 --> 23:20.831
They have guardians with
powers that walk among them.

23:20.833 --> 23:25.035
Guardians directly
responsible for the death
of my father!

23:25.037 --> 23:27.271
Your king!

23:27.273 --> 23:31.008
The volcano that killed
your father was not
the fault of the surfacers,

23:31.010 --> 23:33.043
but the one who attacked them.

23:33.045 --> 23:38.248
Death by collateral damage
in a surface war
does not comfort me.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.752
They kill our race.
They poison our oceans.

23:41.754 --> 23:45.055
They will destroy this
planet and take
Atlantis with it.

23:45.057 --> 23:48.292
We must protect our
people and attack!

23:48.294 --> 23:53.964
As long as I am Queen,
you will preserve
the peace, at all costs.

23:58.303 --> 24:01.405
Do I make myself clear?

24:01.407 --> 24:02.873
Yes, Mother.

24:09.414 --> 24:12.983
- Damn her!
- Patience, My Liege.

24:12.985 --> 24:16.453
He has always been a problem
child, coddled by his father,

24:16.455 --> 24:18.455
unsuitable for the throne.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.425
Our only hope for peaceful
existence with
the surface dwellers

24:21.427 --> 24:24.795
is with the one
who is of both worlds.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.931
What of my other son?
Have you seen Arthur?

24:27.933 --> 24:30.901
- Yes, my Queen.
- And?

24:30.903 --> 24:35.105
My Queen, he is not yet
ready for the weight
of the crown.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.307
He will learn
at my side, Mera.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.076
Bring him to me at once.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.485
YOUNG ARTHUR: Dad,
watch, I can get to the top.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.321
(GIGGLING)

24:51.323 --> 24:54.891
Not too far, Arthur.
Don't fall in.

24:55.793 --> 24:57.294
I can do it.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.429
I'm a better swimmer
than you are.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.438
Arthur, no!

25:50.848 --> 25:52.115
(GASPING)

25:54.485 --> 25:58.321
- I told you to be careful.
- I saw her, Dad.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.525
I saw my mother.
She was watching me
in the water.

26:01.527 --> 26:05.328
-She kissed me.
-It was just the sea playing
tricks on you, son.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.031
No, it was her. I saw her.

26:08.033 --> 26:12.002
She left, Arthur,
and she's not coming back.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.237
It's just you and me now, son.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.440
And I'm not going anywhere.

26:18.843 --> 26:19.910
(GASPING)

(GROANING)

26:38.963 --> 26:40.263
(SIGHING)

26:43.801 --> 26:45.535
These photos of Arthur Curry

26:45.537 --> 26:48.271
are proof positive
of everything I've been
working towards.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.373
BLACK MANTA: <i> I'm very pleased</i>
<i>for you, Doctor.</i>

26:50.375 --> 26:53.910
The world will have
to believe me now.
They'll know what I know.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.213
-Call me after you've
made contact.
<i>-I will.</i>

26:56.215 --> 26:59.149
Congratulations, David.
I could not have
found him without you.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.818
Thank you, sir.

-Excellent, I will
handle the rest.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.270
Take your men to Mercy Reef.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.507
Give Dr. Shin
and the half-breed
my warmest regards.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.259
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:42.261 --> 27:44.327
DR. SHIN:
Hello, Mr. Curry, hello?

27:44.962 --> 27:46.563
(GROANING)

27:47.465 --> 27:49.933
You have to go away.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.701
(SIGHING) Go away or kill me.

27:51.703 --> 27:55.205
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-I must talk
to you, Mr. Curry.

27:55.207 --> 27:59.276
Come back later.
I'm really hungry now
and not in a good way.

27:59.278 --> 28:03.180
I've information
you need to know.
It's about your father.

28:13.824 --> 28:14.891
(GASPING)

28:19.564 --> 28:21.131
Thank you
for seeing me, Arthur.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.567
I have answers for you.
I know what you seek.

28:23.569 --> 28:28.638
All right, slow down,
slow down. I had
a rough night.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.175
- Who are you?
- I am Dr. Steven Shin,

28:32.177 --> 28:34.477
theoretical marine biologist.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.246
Your father, Thomas,
contacted me.

28:36.981 --> 28:39.182
My father's dead.

28:39.184 --> 28:42.352
I know. He was looking
for answers and I have them.

28:42.354 --> 28:46.022
You, my boy, are the key
to all of my research.

28:46.024 --> 28:50.093
Okay, I'm gonna let
you in because I just can't
talk through a door anymore.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.563
(GRUNTING)

30:15.314 --> 30:20.083
Arthur Curry is under
my protection by
order of Queen Atlanna.

30:20.085 --> 30:23.186
- Relinquish him to us, Mera.
- Or what?

30:23.188 --> 30:27.123
Or we'll take him
over your smoldering corpse.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.858
You are welcome to try.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.060
Fire!

(MOANING)

31:33.924 --> 31:36.659
Follow my lead.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.829
I am an investigative
reporter, you know.

31:39.831 --> 31:44.734
BATMAN: Journalism's dead.
Someone got here first.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.370
-Looks like
it's been ransacked.
-That's not all.

31:47.372 --> 31:49.773
Someone destroyed
Shin's life's work.

31:49.775 --> 31:53.276
- Then where's Shin?
- Probably dead.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.378
How do you figure?

31:55.380 --> 32:00.717
You don't destroy someone's
work and then let them live
to recreate it.

32:00.719 --> 32:04.521
- Good point.
- Don't touch anything!

32:13.764 --> 32:17.934
Hmm. Who is this?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.969
BATMAN: Whoever he is,
he's got gills, too.

32:19.971 --> 32:23.773
Cyborg, run your facial
recognition program
off this picture.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.842
CYBORG: <i> Roger that.</i>

32:29.580 --> 32:31.481
<i>Name's Arthur Curry.</i>

32:31.483 --> 32:34.217
I got a water-logged letter
from a Thomas Curry,
but it's illegible.

32:37.788 --> 32:41.591
Cyborg, can you
extrapolate this text?

32:41.593 --> 32:44.194
<i>You got it.
Coming at you now.</i>

32:47.498 --> 32:51.768
Thomas Curry begging
Dr. Shin for help
with his son, Arthur.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.269
Why Shin?

32:53.271 --> 32:56.706
Shin suspects Curry's son
is half Atlantean.

32:59.109 --> 33:01.611
QUEEN ATLANNA: Invoke
the emergency protocols.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.813
We must tend to
our wounded first.

33:03.815 --> 33:08.785
Do you see? Do you see
what the surface dwellers
are capable of?

33:08.787 --> 33:13.790
This is terrorism.
No, this is an act of war!

33:13.792 --> 33:16.426
(ALL AGREEING)

33:16.428 --> 33:20.597
Our people swim
in a cloud of fear
of the surfacers.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.999
This attack tells us
what we already know.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.102
The surface world
wants us dead.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.972
My father distrusted
the humans.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.207
He saw them as inferior to us.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.877
He made plans
to cleanse the surface.

33:33.879 --> 33:39.482
And I say we break the seal
on the Atlantean war plans.

33:39.484 --> 33:41.384
- ALL: Yes!
- No!

33:43.721 --> 33:47.824
War would cause senseless
ruin on both sides.

33:47.826 --> 33:52.462
However, I hear the fear
behind my son's words.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.865
Perhaps it is time
for our worlds to
come together.

33:55.867 --> 33:59.235
-Heresy!
-But, my Queen,
our traditions.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.839
Have Manta arrange
a meeting between myself
and this Justice League.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.241
I will broker a peace
with them in person.

As you wish, Mother.

34:14.150 --> 34:19.054

Good, you're awake.

34:55.391 --> 34:58.094
What's this? Who are you?

34:58.096 --> 35:02.966
I'm Mera, sent by your mother,
Queen Atlanna, to bring
you back to Atlantis.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.268
Lady, the only
so-called mother I know

35:05.270 --> 35:07.537
ditched me and my dad
when I was just a baby.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.773
It's far more complicated
than that, Arthur Curry.

35:10.775 --> 35:15.278
When she was very young,
your mother met and fell
in love with your father.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.047
That union resulted
in your birth.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.983
Our Queen's firstborn.

35:19.985 --> 35:23.152
<i>But she was royalty
and promised to our king.</i>

35:26.657 --> 35:30.026
<i>She could neither wed</i>
<i>your father nor raise</i>
<i>a halfling child.</i>

35:33.130 --> 35:36.399
<i>Heartbroken, she returned
to lead her people.</i>

35:40.638 --> 35:44.240
But she never stopped
loving you or your father.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.275
Now she needs your help.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.244
She believes
you are our future

35:48.246 --> 35:51.381
and can forestall war
and bridge the two worlds.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.284
I, I never knew any of this.

kept this hidden
in these ancient ruins.

36:11.635 --> 36:14.137
This was
our king's royal garb.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.872
Now it is yours.

36:19.276 --> 36:20.777
You find it yet?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.045
Not yet.

36:22.047 --> 36:23.813
It's a little harder
than it looks.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.049
Well, I hope so.
It doesn't look that hard.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.819
