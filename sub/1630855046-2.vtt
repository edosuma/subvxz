WEBVTT

00:17.475 --> 00:20.145
Starting my fucking day like this.
What the fuck?

00:20.145 --> 00:21.771
I can't believe this shit!

00:22.647 --> 00:25.900
Bitch-ass handyman
pissing on my fucking hardwood floor.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.445
This is European oak, motherfucker!

00:29.237 --> 00:31.614
"Ooh. Is your husband home?"

00:31.614 --> 00:34.034
No! I'm home. Fuck you!

00:34.534 --> 00:37.412
- Cocksucking piece of shit.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.122
Shut the fuck up!

00:40.415 --> 00:42.792
I have worked too hard for this shit.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.294
Look at this.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.004
Oh, my God, the smell.

01:09.527 --> 01:10.528
<i>Hello?</i>

01:10.528 --> 01:13.573
Do you have any idea
who you just fucked with? Huh?

01:13.573 --> 01:16.326
You useless, shameful little shit!

01:16.326 --> 01:18.161
- I'm gonna--
<i>- Okay, bitch.</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:25.001
<i>You've reached
At Cho Service Construction.</i>

01:25.001 --> 01:27.879
<i>- Danny can't come to the phone--</i>

01:29.005 --> 01:29.964
Babe?

01:32.050 --> 01:32.967
What happened?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.732
Yo, remember that guy
I got into that road rage with?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.317
Turns out it was a woman.

01:50.485 --> 01:54.614
Sometimes rock bottom is your trampoline.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.740
I can't hear you.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.625
"P.S. he pissed all over my bathroom.
One star." What the fuck?

02:11.297 --> 02:12.924
Life is precious, man.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.344
You can't waste it. You gotta take action.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.804
If you're hungry, eat a steak.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.307
If you want to feel the sun on your face,
it's right there.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.895
See something you like, baby bro,
you go get it.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.606
You gotta take control.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.024
I am in control.

02:30.024 --> 02:30.984
Oh, yeah?

02:31.901 --> 02:33.236
What's your plan then?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.781
I'm gonna take a shit,
then I'm gonna go play ball.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.658
No, like, in your life.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.576
Right now.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.661
In your one precious life,
what is your plan?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.997
Once you change my passwords back,

02:43.997 --> 02:48.585
I'm going to become a crypto millionaire
and travel the world with my boys.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.545
Okay, your boys.

02:51.045 --> 02:54.632
What are you and boys gonna do?
Like, what's your boys' plan?

02:54.632 --> 02:58.011
That's easy. Three Ten-X trades.
1K to 10K.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.095
10K to a hundred.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.513
A hundred to a million. Boom.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.724
You're just saying higher numbers.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.810
Well, what's your plan?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.022
This steak is mad overcooked.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.613
"Bad plumbing, bad breath!"

03:20.867 --> 03:24.078
Honey, you shouldn't be cleaning up
another man's piss.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.497
You never know
what someone's going through in life.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.999
Might be bladder issues.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.417
What?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.961
Why else would he urinate on the floor?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.213
Did you upset him?

03:34.213 --> 03:37.050
- Why are you assuming it's my fault?
- I'm not.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.512
But sometimes you can come across
a little cold.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.808
George, he ran away smiling.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.980
Okay. Well, anger is just
a transitory state of consciousness.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.483
Best to let it go. He's already gone.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.569
If we pay $80,
we can get his address online.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.947
What do you wanna do?
Go over there with your gun?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.283
No-- Of course not, I--

04:03.159 --> 04:04.410
George...

04:04.410 --> 04:08.331
he came into our home
and he violated our sacred space.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.749
Don't you wanna...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.752
I don't know, to...

04:12.752 --> 04:14.754
go over there and say something?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.631
You know, be assertive?

04:24.472 --> 04:26.599
He didn't like that you're Japanese.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.443
Are you sure we're at the right address?

04:37.443 --> 04:40.780
It makes sense,
he didn't scream "homeowner" to me.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.288
Are you enjoying this?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.752
George! George, come here.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.170
Look, look.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.507
That is the back of an Asian head
if I've ever seen one.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.842
Shit.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.343
Okay.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.263
You wanna talk first since you know him?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.307
- No...
Howdy there, love bugs.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.227
Can I interest you in our best suite?

05:11.227 --> 05:13.771
And don't worry,
it's the only question I'll ask you.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.858
Oh, sorry. We're not trying to stay here.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.568
We're looking for a Daniel Cho.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.154
- What?
- He's a Korean guy.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.948
Got a real, like, oily way about him.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.619
Drives a red truck.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.246
- Oh, the son.
Yeah.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.623
I took over from the Cho family
about a year ago.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.876
Older Korean couple,
a little condescending.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.753
- That sounds about right.
- Amy.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.005
They folded the place
because of a police raid.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.132
Someone was running
illegal goods out of here.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.925
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.762
But the son... kind of sucks, right?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.100
Yo, nice Taco. What year is that?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.560
It's 2004.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.064
- You missed the upgrade by a year.
- The old one's tougher.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.275
- Plus, it's extra cab, pre-runner, V6.
- Oh, my bad.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.111
Hey, thanks for letting me
store my shit here.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.489
Yeah, man. Dude, any time.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.490
Um...

06:06.407 --> 06:08.701
Hey, so the money I borrowed...

06:09.285 --> 06:10.578
Again, thank you.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.540
It's gonna take me a bit longer
to pay you back, if that's cool?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.459
Why?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.921
Remember that road rage incident
I told you about?

06:19.921 --> 06:20.838
Yeah.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.717
Turns out it was a woman.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.052
- You hit a woman?
- No.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.888
- That's not okay.
- No, I did not hit anybody.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.056
Okay? I just...

06:30.640 --> 06:33.601
I pissed in her bathroom
and now she's writing negative reviews

06:33.601 --> 06:35.103
and killing my business.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.979
Yo, is she hot? Is she fine?

06:36.979 --> 06:39.273
She's some rich bitch from Calabasas.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.109
She's probably sitting at home all day

06:41.109 --> 06:43.736
eating baguettes and jam or some shit.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.196
Yo, fuck that bitch.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.240
- Take your time with the money.
- Really?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.493
We're family. Just give me
the title to your truck in the meantime.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.578
Help me with this. Use your legs.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.746
Yeah.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.165
You should just fold your business.
Start a new one.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.209
I can't apply for a new business license.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.544
You can. That shit's easy.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.754
Just do it under someone else's name.
Use mine.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.049
Okay. I'll think about it.

07:05.049 --> 07:08.427
Yo, what is in this box? It's so heavy.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.512
Laptop batteries.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.598
I got a friend in Busan,
he sells me those shits wholesale.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.767
Okay.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.519
It's nothing like the motel.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.188
Completely legit.
I'm paying tariffs, all that shit.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.775
Yeah. No, of course. Yeah.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.446
Oh, shit.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.910
You think they did it?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.246
They're just kids.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.213
Honey, have you never
changed a tire before?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.382
Have you?

07:46.382 --> 07:48.593
Well, Junie's gonna be
done with school soon.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.554
Yeah, this is your fault.
- I'll change it for 40 bucks!

07:56.642 --> 07:57.685
Do you have cash?

08:07.570 --> 08:08.779
It's all yours, bro.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.990
Oh, God.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.244
You know, make sure you pinch your back

08:15.244 --> 08:16.829
when you get down there,

08:16.829 --> 08:18.789
then also activate your core--

08:18.789 --> 08:19.749
Okay.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.961
See, I did chest yesterday, so...

08:27.423 --> 08:30.843
Yo, I was thinking, man,
maybe it's crazy, but...

08:31.719 --> 08:35.473
I was thinking we should start
a new contracting company.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.517
- As brothers.
- Why?

08:38.059 --> 08:40.561
You call me lazy like 14 times a day.

08:40.561 --> 08:44.148
That's just tough love.
You're ready to step up. I can tell.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.651
You mean that?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.568
Yeah.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.238
I know you're big into your crypto,

08:50.238 --> 08:52.823
and I'm gonna change the passwords back...

08:53.407 --> 08:55.284
but you need money to make money, right?

08:57.245 --> 09:00.039
Yo, if we do this,
are you gonna actually listen to me?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.457
Yeah.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.875
'Cause I got ideas.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.127
Yeah, we're a team. What you got?

09:06.170 --> 09:07.338
Cho Bros.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.590
Yo. That's perfect, dude.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.510
- Cho Bros, that's perfect. Yes.
- Cho Bros.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.887
Yes. I'll do the paperwork right now.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.473
I'm gonna put the company in your name, yeah?

09:17.473 --> 09:18.683
Yeah.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.728
Yo, we gotta target Orange County Koreans.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.897
What? We don't know any OC Koreans.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.150
Didn't Veronica move to the OC?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.069
That's a delicate situation.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.864
It's been like two decades.
I'm sure she doesn't give a shit.

09:33.864 --> 09:38.160
Veronica and I hooked up in 2008
and twice in 2011, okay?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.370
It was recent.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.164
I thought she broke up with you
when she got into UC Irvine.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.082
Who told you that?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.875
I broke up with her.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
Didn't she meet her husband at UC Irvine?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.756
Yo, dude, you're taking too long.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.757
Keep up.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.636
I always liked Veronica.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.473
- She taught me how to read.
- I wasn't ready.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.477
I had to build up the business
before I could start a family, you know?

10:03.477 --> 10:05.438
Plus I had to take care of you, fucker.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.066
Yo, OC's the move, man.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.484
Just trust me on this.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.452
Naomi, thank you so much for coming over.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.203
June was having the worst day.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.622
No worries, of course.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.165
George was so pissed.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.125
I made us late picking her up and then...

10:27.043 --> 10:28.252
she hit a teacher.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.339
Yeah. They called her dysregulated.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.757
- Ew. Oh, my God.
- I know.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.967
Do not beat yourself up over that.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.678
Izzy bit our neighbor's dog.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.513
- No.
- I know.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.515
Usually it's the other way around, right?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.353
We should do this more. We live so close.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.855
Yeah, we should, I would love that.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.566
I can't believe we met through Jordan,
of all people.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.152
Oh, my God. I know, right? It's so crazy.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.656
Uh, hey, do you think
she's gonna be annoyed

10:56.656 --> 10:59.450
that I rescheduled my meeting with her
because of June?

10:59.450 --> 11:02.161
No. No, you had to.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.500
But actually, between you and me,
don't say it was a family thing.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.877
I'd say it was a work emergency.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.545
Oh, okay. Good to know.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.049
You wanna choose your words wisely
with my sister-in-law.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.302
If you ever need any advice,
call me anytime.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.013
Aw. Thank you so much, Naomi.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.266
I just really need this deal to close.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.019
- Straight up. You know?
- Oh, my God. Yeah.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.647
I just,
I have been so on edge lately and...

11:29.647 --> 11:31.107
God, I am so jealous.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.194
It must be nice getting
to spend all day at home with Izzy.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.780
Yeah! No, it's great...

11:39.824 --> 11:41.992
but I don't spend all day at home.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.789
- Oh. No, of course, I didn't mean--
- Yeah, I have my nonprofits. And I write.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.541
And Jordan comes to me

11:48.541 --> 11:51.460
- for business advice from time to time.
- I heard that. Yes, I--

11:51.460 --> 11:53.337
- That's a lot to juggle.
- Yeah.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.133
Then when Jordan gets on a roll,
she will just text me non-stop.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.636
And we talk stocks,
we talk omnichannel retail...

12:00.636 --> 12:02.972
I sent this one video to her recently.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.016
Did you see the road rage thing
on Nextdoor?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.645
- Is that an app?
- Oh, my gosh, look at this.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.523
I mean, can you believe that?

12:14.900 --> 12:18.320
I can't understand
what those people are so angry about.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.283
Ah, you know, I mean,
most people don't understand that...

12:22.992 --> 12:25.953
anger is just a transitory state
of consciousness.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.830
I love that.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.000
You're so smart, Amy.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.795
No, really. No wonder Jordan loves you.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.301
All I'm saying is, Veronica,

12:40.301 --> 12:44.763
we grew up together, you know us,
we know you, you trust us, you know?

12:44.763 --> 12:50.352
Uh, we do maintenance, renovations, paint,
yard work, inside work, like everything.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.437
Anything you need.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.354
We do it all.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.231
Right, Danny?

12:54.231 --> 12:57.109
Yeah, I'm the king of grout.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.444
We also do grout.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.654
I mean, that's all very impressive.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.282
- Yeah, I hear grout's tricky. Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.745
Um, is there anything we can work on?

13:08.537 --> 13:09.371
Yeah.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.042
Uh, the place is pretty good for now,

13:13.042 --> 13:16.587
but if anything comes up,
we'll be sure to give you a call.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.256
And if you're around more,
you should swing by our church.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.175
Edwin leads praise team.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.676
Oh, that's cool.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.512
We don't go to church anymore, but...

13:24.512 --> 13:27.139
Uh, we still-- We sometimes do.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.391
Yeah. Stop by.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.726
The more the merrier.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.353
Here.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.940
Remember that fussy overhead projector
at our old church?

13:38.275 --> 13:40.277
Gosh, we were so different then.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.073
- I remember everything.
- I remember too.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.249
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make a real quick call.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.002
Our friend Esther
was just complaining about her plumber.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.630
- Oh.
- Yo, what's going on?

13:59.630 --> 14:02.216
<i>Nothing much, man.
I'm just finishing up taking a shit.</i>

14:02.216 --> 14:04.009
<i>Rubbing some Cortizone on my back.</i>

14:04.760 --> 14:06.303
You texted "9-1-1."

14:06.303 --> 14:08.138
<i>Oh, shit. Yeah, I did.</i>

14:08.138 --> 14:11.976
<i>Remember that guy Chad
who lived at the motel?</i>

14:11.976 --> 14:13.227
Yeah.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.814
<i>Well, dude, he still lives there
and his life's a mess, man.</i>

14:16.814 --> 14:18.107
<i>I think he has gout.</i>

14:18.732 --> 14:19.692
Okay...

14:20.234 --> 14:21.068
so?

14:21.068 --> 14:24.905
<i>Dude, get this.
So I lent him some money for his meds,</i>

14:24.905 --> 14:26.991
<i>but I don't think he used it on them.</i>

14:26.991 --> 14:29.869
- What are you trying to say?
<i>- I'm getting to it.</i>

14:29.869 --> 14:33.080
<i>We can't just chill
and have small talk sometimes?</i>

14:33.080 --> 14:35.875
We talk small all the time,
like, all the time.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.879
<i>All right, fine, look, he said
an Asian couple was looking for you.</i>

14:39.879 --> 14:41.213
<i>They looked rich.</i>

14:41.922 --> 14:43.924
What does this bitch want from me?

14:43.924 --> 14:46.677
She got a house, she has kids.
What do I got?

14:46.677 --> 14:48.679
<i>Dude! You got lots of shit, man.</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:50.431
<i>You got me, got your truck.</i>

14:50.431 --> 14:52.308
<i>Technically it's mine now...</i>

14:52.308 --> 14:54.351
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.187
- Thanks for the heads up.
<i>- Yeah, no problem.</i>

14:57.187 --> 14:59.273
- I gotta go.
<i>- Hit me up whenever.</i>

15:12.870 --> 15:13.704
Who was that?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.498
Uh, it was probably just spam.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.918
Let me help you with that. Turn around.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.044
It's fine, I can do it.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.712
Oh, I don't mind.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.548
Makes you dependent on me
so you can't leave.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.092
I can tie a tie.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.012
George, come on,
you still mad about earlier?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.681
No, just let me tie my tie.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.851
I'm gonna go check on June.

15:35.851 --> 15:36.810
Okay.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.319
<i>Listen--</i>
- I decided not to wear it.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.201
<i>Listen to me. I'm a dangerous guy.</i>

15:53.494 --> 15:57.623
<i>You're just a bored, suburban housewife
with no purpose, okay?</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:01.460
<i>I bet you're mad at yourself
for letting your whole life pass you by.</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:04.630
<i>I bet you had big dreams.
Anything was possible.</i>

16:04.630 --> 16:05.547
<i>Then you blinked.</i>

16:05.547 --> 16:08.592
<i>And now you're stuck
in a life you never wanted.</i>

16:08.592 --> 16:11.053
<i>You have it all, but you're empty inside.</i>

16:11.053 --> 16:14.181
<i>You feel weak,
you want to take back control.</i>

16:14.181 --> 16:17.977
<i>Well, guess what.
You won't take it from me, okay?</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:20.688
<i>I'm a fucking animal!
I can't be fucked with!</i>

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
<i>I do the fucking!</i>

16:22.189 --> 16:26.151
<i>So stop messing with me
and leave me alone or else.</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:27.319
<i>You hear me?</i>

16:27.861 --> 16:29.071
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

16:29.071 --> 16:31.991
<i>You do not want to unleash the beast.
You don't!</i>

17:17.703 --> 17:19.288
Who the fuck?

17:20.205 --> 17:23.459
I'm so glad Veronica sent you.
No problem, Esther.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.377
So are you from Orange County?

17:25.377 --> 17:28.422
No, we grew up outside San Bernardino.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.549
My parents owned a motel
near Raging Waters.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.342
Nice. That must've done well.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.762
Apparently, before I was born.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.514
And then Hurricane Harbor opened up, so...

17:37.514 --> 17:39.600
I've never really been to either.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.852
We should go. Harbor?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.688
Oh, it's sick.
There's this ride, Taboo Towers.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.941
Got one way up, three ways down.
It's unpredictable.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.568
Kind of like how I live my life.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.571
Anyways, I do investing.
This is like my side gig.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.199
- So if you ever need investing advice--

17:55.199 --> 17:58.243
- Um, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.331
- Yo. You done yet?
- I would be if you were helping me

18:02.331 --> 18:04.333
instead of flirting
with the customer base.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.168
Dude, it's called client services.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.379
Do not text on the job.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.883
- Who is that?
- Her name's Kayla.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.676
Yo, she's bad, right?

18:15.219 --> 18:16.762
This is a bot.

18:17.805 --> 18:18.680
You're a bot.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.412
Following our marriage
in the summer of 1979,

18:42.412 --> 18:46.583
Haru became deeply conscious
of negative space.

18:46.583 --> 18:52.381
Oh, he fell in love with the interplay
between void and substance.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.799
So naturally,

18:53.799 --> 18:55.551
the curvature of the seat

18:55.551 --> 18:58.554
is modeled after the contours
of my own backside.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.639
Oh, fabulous.
That's amazing.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.934
Fumi, we're so grateful
to have a Tamago chair on loan.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.728
I'd love to get your eyes
on our other pieces.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.110
Quite the origin story for a chair, huh?

19:13.110 --> 19:15.779
Jordan, thank you so much for coming.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.115
Thank you for having me. Who is this?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.159
Oh, this is Junie. June, say hi.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.786
Okay, hopefully she'll get more polite
as she gets older.

19:22.786 --> 19:27.124
So tell me,
is all of that true or made up?

19:27.749 --> 19:28.709
I'm sorry, what?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.254
A good story drives the price, as we know.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.134
I have photos of my mom
sitting naked on the mold.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.177
Really?

19:49.771 --> 19:50.647
How much?

19:50.647 --> 19:52.274
It's not for sale.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.650
George?

19:54.985 --> 19:57.529
I'm sure that there's a price.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.365
Sorry. Gotta put my foot down.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.620
Joji, Joji, Joji. Let's not play games.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.913
A hundred thousand.

20:05.913 --> 20:06.914
How's that?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.292
Nope. No way, Jordana.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.130
This exhibit has been great.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.508
Thank you so much for having me,
but I should be leaving. Cheers.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.011
You know, I thought we could hang out

20:21.011 --> 20:22.346
and talk about the deal?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.432
I really need to
get to my friend's housewarming.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.726
It's in Nepal, so...

20:28.477 --> 20:29.436
Bye-bye.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.361
Hey! Cheers, baby bro!

20:37.361 --> 20:39.696
Here's to making the most
of the time we got left!

20:40.948 --> 20:42.699
Yo, I said cheers!

20:48.830 --> 20:51.041
Hey, man. When you're 40, 50,

20:51.041 --> 20:54.002
you're gonna wanna come home to your girl
making kimchi jjigae.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.755
Maybe I want her to come home
to me making chicken parm.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.298
What?

20:59.007 --> 21:02.469
I want her to come home
to me making her chicken parm!

21:03.971 --> 21:06.765
It's okay to mess around
with white girls now,

21:06.765 --> 21:09.726
but when you settle down,
listen to Mom and Dad,

21:09.726 --> 21:12.312
bring home a nice Korean girl, you know?

21:12.312 --> 21:14.940
You think they'll want
their grandkids looking up at them

21:14.940 --> 21:17.401
with huge round eyes, like fucking bugs?

21:17.401 --> 21:20.904
Yo, you waste way too much time
following arbitrary rules.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.990
Why you talking all weird?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.575
"I gotta build my business
before I start a family."

21:25.575 --> 21:29.246
"I gotta listen to Mom and Dad
and bring home a nice Korean girl."

21:30.038 --> 21:31.206
Bro, just...

21:31.206 --> 21:32.332
just live.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.626
I am living.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.796
All right.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.771
I thought you wanted me
to be more assertive.

21:54.771 --> 21:55.772
Yeah, not now.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.275
There's millions of dollars on the line.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.986
She hasn't even sent the term sheet.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.156
There are more important things
than money.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.451
I spent two years
putting this deal together

22:07.451 --> 22:09.786
and the least you could do is help me.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.705
Excuse me?

22:11.705 --> 22:14.082
- Yeah.
- I do help. I help all the time.

22:14.082 --> 22:18.545
It's like you have no awareness
of how much I have on my plate right now.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.630
I bust my ass for this family.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.174
Hey, so do I.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.427
- Those vases don't just make themselves.
- They also don't make money.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.637
You are obsessed with money.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.848
That's all you ever talk about.

22:29.848 --> 22:33.143
George, I didn't grow up the way you did.
Okay?

22:33.143 --> 22:36.188
You ever notice
how it's only people who have money

22:36.188 --> 22:38.231
that think money isn't important?

22:38.231 --> 22:41.318
The Buddha is only the Buddha
because he was a prince first, right?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.070
He had stuff to renounce.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.822
If money is gonna drive us apart,
then I renounce.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.157
We can't renounce

22:47.157 --> 22:50.243
because all your dad left us
was tables and chairs.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.913
This is a celebration of chairs.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.998
Hi, Mommy!

22:59.169 --> 23:01.379
I wish you would unload
the dishwasher sometimes.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.548
I barely have time
to eat off of those dishes.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.092
Babe, it takes five minutes.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.885
- Or we could do it together.

23:06.885 --> 23:11.473
- Turn on music, make it fun--
- I know. I just, um...

23:12.015 --> 23:16.144
I hear you, let's just try to enjoy
the rest of the evening, okay?

23:16.144 --> 23:17.771
Please don't sit on the art.

23:17.771 --> 23:18.730
Oh.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.440
Okay.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.903
George, I'm just curious,

23:24.903 --> 23:27.614
why are you "liking"
my employee's Instagram photos?

23:29.199 --> 23:31.576
I am supporting your business.

23:31.576 --> 23:35.122
Liking Mia's bikini pics
is helping my business...

23:35.622 --> 23:37.624
- how?
- I don't look at the photos.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.752
- I just read the captions.
- Do you think I'm stupid?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.546
When will you just be honest?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.256
Is it honesty time?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.925
- Is that what we're doing now?
- What?

23:48.677 --> 23:49.886
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm?

23:49.886 --> 23:52.305
Still with that gun?
When you gonna let that go?

23:52.305 --> 23:55.142
When you tell me why
you're always taking it out of the safe.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.602
I didn't want to own a gun, remember?

23:57.602 --> 23:59.271
It was your mother's idea.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.022
Were you going to hurt someone?

24:01.022 --> 24:03.650
- No! George...
- Do I need to be concerned for my safety?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.193
Or for June's safety?

24:10.031 --> 24:11.408
I was masturbating.

24:12.868 --> 24:18.123
I was masturbating with the gun
because sex with you is so, um...

24:19.374 --> 24:20.584
is so, uh...

24:21.668 --> 24:23.503
So what? Say it? So what?

24:24.087 --> 24:25.422
It's vanilla.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.301
It's vanilla, George.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.181
Is this about the piss?

24:34.973 --> 24:35.932
The piss?

24:35.932 --> 24:38.018
If it's about the piss, say it is.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.478
Maybe in a way it is about the piss.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.982
George, he pissed in the house I bought,
all by myself.

24:43.982 --> 24:48.570
That house that I don't even get to enjoy
because I'm always busy working.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.198
When do I get to enjoy something, huh?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.325
Who's gonna buy Amy something?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.409
Amy is.

24:54.409 --> 24:56.536
Amy's gonna buy Amy something.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.623
You can't give up one fucking chair?

25:00.999 --> 25:03.418
I just wanna be taken care of.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.462
Yeah. Well...

25:06.254 --> 25:08.465
I don't fuck guns.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.234
This one's on me.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.819
Sorry, my boss is watching.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.446
All good.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.954
Yo, kids these days, man.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.041
If I was their age, game over--

25:58.640 --> 26:02.560
I guess, when you think about it,
the ground is the original chair.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.512
<i>Now you listen to me, Daniel.</i>

26:37.512 --> 26:39.639
<i>I would love to let this go.</i>

26:40.223 --> 26:43.310
<i>I have a very full life
that I'd love to get back to.</i>

26:43.935 --> 26:45.395
<i>Oh, it's so full.</i>

26:45.395 --> 26:48.273
<i>You wouldn't know what to do
with its fullness.</i>

26:48.815 --> 26:50.817
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

26:50.817 --> 26:53.403
<i>Actions have consequences.</i>

26:54.195 --> 26:57.991
<i>So I'm gonna find you
and take what little you have.</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:12.297
What are you doing?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.548
Let's go. Come on.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.302
Hey, this is my brother, Danny...

27:24.642 --> 27:26.603
Danny, we can all
fit in your truck, right?

27:31.733 --> 27:32.567
Yo.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.653
Holy shit.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.578
Damn.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.416
Let's go drink more, it's fine.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.752
- Get off me.
- Don't fuck this up.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.796
- I got two cuties--
- Get off.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.215
Dude, I'm trying to fucking help you.

27:55.215 --> 27:58.551
You're not helping me.
Seriously, get the fuck off me!

28:00.512 --> 28:01.388
Fuck you!

28:03.181 --> 28:04.891
You're fired from Cho Bros!

28:05.892 --> 28:08.895
I'm fired? You're fired.
I came up with the name.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.356
You can't fire me, you fucking idiot.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.732
The company's under my name,

28:12.732 --> 28:15.068
I can fire whoever I want,
including you, bitch.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.445
Are you kidding me? It's not real yet!

28:17.445 --> 28:19.989
I asked you because I can't use my name!

28:19.989 --> 28:23.201
Whose name are you going to use?
Mom, Dad? You don't have anyone else!

28:23.201 --> 28:25.328
Isaac offered.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.081
Isaac?

28:29.457 --> 28:30.291
Really?

29:01.364 --> 29:02.282
Hey, babe.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.702
How was the rest of the evening?

29:08.204 --> 29:09.414
I put June to bed.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.000
Thank you for doing that, honey.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.626
Amy...

29:14.753 --> 29:15.795
We need to talk.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.047
Yeah.

29:18.923 --> 29:23.136
I think we need couples therapy
and I know how you feel about this--

29:23.136 --> 29:24.053
Let's do it.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.308
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.394
Yeah, George, I--

29:32.103 --> 29:34.022
I still remember our first date,

29:34.022 --> 29:34.939
thinking...

29:35.815 --> 29:38.860
"Wow, we are a perfect pair."

29:40.653 --> 29:42.614
And I want us to stay that way.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.450
I do. I...

29:48.453 --> 29:49.412
I love you.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.374
I love you.

29:57.545 --> 29:58.755
