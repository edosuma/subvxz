WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:07.280
Hey, Treen-a-reena.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.910
Oh, hey, you want a soda?

00:09.980 --> 00:10.810
Uh, sure.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.370
Me too, gimme money.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.360
Okay, now, watch as I scare the
lip gloss off of Tori and trina.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.070
I don't even know why you would choose it.

00:29.130 --> 00:46.220
I mean... now...
Laser assault.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.990
I think the rebels won that one.

00:51.060 --> 00:54.660
Hey, thanks a lot for
whacking my astro craft!

00:54.730 --> 00:55.990
It was attacking us.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.200
And stupid.

00:58.260 --> 01:01.230
We have artwork throughout the
whole building, and this is kinda

01:01.300 --> 01:02.500
the main hallway.

01:02.570 --> 01:05.239
Get some shots of the
kids on the stairs there.

01:08.170 --> 01:21.750
Oh, my God, they're filming something.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.490
That girl keeps blockin' my shot.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.920
Hey, what's goin' on?

01:25.990 --> 01:27.890
Oh, these guys are shooting a tv show.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.190
A TV show?

01:29.260 --> 01:31.330
I wanna be on a TV show.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.500
What show are you guys from?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.200
It's a new one,
called "The Wood."

01:34.270 --> 01:35.100
I wanna be on "The Wood."

01:35.170 --> 01:35.800
What's "The Wood"?

01:35.870 --> 01:37.530
I wanna be on it.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.570
These are the producers, Kyle and...
Mick.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.310
Mick.

01:41.370 --> 01:41.910
Oh, hi.

01:41.970 --> 01:42.670
Hi.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.140
Hey, I'm Robbie.

01:44.210 --> 01:45.910
Spelled with two bs.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.810
So, what's "the wood" about?

01:47.880 --> 01:50.610
It's a reality show...
About teenagers in Hollywood.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.280
I'm a teenager, and I'm
in Hollywood right now.

01:52.350 --> 01:54.990
See?

01:55.050 --> 01:57.790
They're here getting some shots
of our school... and to look

01:57.860 --> 01:59.460
for interesting kids to
feature on the show.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.360
So, is there gonna be
like a casting session?

02:01.430 --> 02:01.930
Uh-huh.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.730
After school, in the black box.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.000
I'll be there.

02:09.070 --> 02:10.870
Hey, can we get some shots of kids outside?

02:10.940 --> 02:14.710
Sure, let's go this way.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.910
So, you guys gonna try out?

02:16.980 --> 02:17.540
Yeah.

02:17.610 --> 02:18.240
Ah, I don't know.

02:18.310 --> 02:19.280
A reality show?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.210
Yeah, they can be really fun sometimes.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.010
Yeah, but I'm an actor.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.620
I don't know if I wanna be involved...
hey, I think my astro craft

02:25.680 --> 02:26.980
still works.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.720
I thought I killed that thing.

02:28.790 --> 02:31.760
You may have inflicted some
minor damage, but watch.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.420
As I press "return to base,"

02:33.490 --> 02:38.300
and have it come right...

about to audition for The Wood.

03:45.010 --> 03:48.560
I think Jade spit in my coffee.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.230
Feeling: Perky.

03:52.900 --> 03:58.670
Okay, next...
Hey.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.180
Tori Vega.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.150
Girl.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.550
We can tell.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.950
Okay, Tori, this is a
really informal audition.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.150
We're just tryin' to get a
feel for your personality.

04:09.220 --> 04:09.950
Got it.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.750
Feel away.

04:11.820 --> 04:15.360
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

04:15.430 --> 04:16.490
Oh.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.589
Oh, wow.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.860
Oh, I know.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.330
I squirted the hot cheese
all over my friend

04:22.400 --> 04:24.900
and her current boyfriend,
who was my ex-boyfriend,

04:24.970 --> 04:26.340
and then I kissed him
right in front of her,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.640
which I felt really bad about.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.770
But then, it was okay, 'cause she
punched me right in the face.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.950
Put a star by this girl.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.610
Tell us something you love.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.250
Easy, music.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.480
And something you hate?

04:40.550 --> 04:42.120
Brussel sprouts.

04:42.190 --> 04:45.120
Okay, what if there was a really great song

04:45.190 --> 04:49.790
about brussel sprouts?

04:49.860 --> 04:55.060
Well, y'know, I'd probably...
I'd probably feel like...

04:55.130 --> 04:58.700
Because when... it usually depends on...

04:58.770 --> 05:03.740
Um, may I go to the bathroom?

05:03.810 --> 05:09.310
Okay, picture me sitting on a
pony wearing a bright purple hat.

05:09.380 --> 05:13.620
I... I was wearing the
purple hat, not the pony.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.590
Do they even make pony hats?

05:15.650 --> 05:18.790
Anyway, I was looking faboo.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.290
And so, then, I realized
acting is not about acting.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.230
It's about letting the emotions
inside of you come out

05:24.290 --> 05:28.760
and represent moments...
are you dating anyone?

05:28.830 --> 05:29.930
Katie.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.540
I just think we should know
if he has a girlfriend.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.500
Do you?

05:35.570 --> 05:36.740
Yeah, I do.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.910
Dang it!

05:39.980 --> 05:42.180
Okay, I'm Robbie.

05:42.250 --> 05:42.980
I'm Rex.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.710
No.

05:43.780 --> 05:44.680
Thank you for your time.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.350
Jerks.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.950
Okay, Jade, what do you hate?

05:49.020 --> 05:54.920
Uh, tuna fish, flowers,
giggling, the word panties,

05:54.990 --> 05:58.630
cilantro, rainbows, ducks.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.860
Man, I hate ducks.

06:01.930 --> 06:05.740
Cramps, string cheese,
clocks, wet doorknobs,

06:05.800 --> 06:13.080
bras that hook in the front,
the lolor yellow, carpeting...

06:13.140 --> 06:17.350
Yeah, you know, I like
shirts with green stripes.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.450
Hey, Beck.

06:18.520 --> 06:22.250
Smell my arm.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.550
No perfume.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.290
That's my natural scent.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.660
I have to live with her.

06:29.730 --> 06:30.790
Hey, you guys.

06:30.860 --> 06:31.930
Hey.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.630
How's it goin'?

06:32.700 --> 06:35.430
Kyle has some cool news for you.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.900
Tori Vega, Beck oliver, Jade
West, and Andre Harris,

06:38.970 --> 06:39.640
congratulations.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.670
You're all gonna be
featured on "the wood."

06:41.740 --> 06:42.470
Really?

06:42.540 --> 06:43.340
Fantastic.

06:43.410 --> 06:44.370
And what about me?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.940
No.

06:46.010 --> 06:46.910
Why not?

06:46.980 --> 06:49.410
'Cause you reek of desperation.

06:49.480 --> 06:54.780
That's her natural scent.

06:54.850 --> 06:55.720
Here you go.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.690
Thanks, festus.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.590
I want a tamale.

06:57.650 --> 07:01.090
Too bad, he got the last one.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.020
Give it to me.

07:02.090 --> 07:02.960
No, I want it.

07:03.030 --> 07:05.130
Look, I am not in a good
mood, and I want a tamale.

07:05.200 --> 07:05.660
So, hand it over.

07:05.730 --> 07:06.460
No.

07:06.530 --> 07:09.670
I'm not kidding around with you.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.230
Hey! Stop it!

07:10.300 --> 07:12.440
Let go off the tamale.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.770
It's my tamale.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.840
No fighting over tamales.

07:20.910 --> 07:24.710
Aah!

07:30.020 --> 07:32.250
Okay, so, how do you want me to do this?

07:32.320 --> 07:34.320
Just tell us where you
are, what you're doing.

07:34.390 --> 07:36.730
And really have fun with it.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.460
Okay.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.930
Whuddup, whuddup, chickity,
chickity, check it out.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.270
You got t-vega, that's
Tori vegadocious.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.940
Initials t-v on your tv.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.170
Not that much fun.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.410
I was being urban.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.310
Yeah, not really.

07:53.310 --> 07:56.950
Aw man, why do I always get the
hiccups when I talk urban?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.550
Let's just try it again.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.350
Right.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.680
Hey, I'm Tori Vega.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.520
I live here in the Hollywood
hills with my mom, dad,

08:05.590 --> 08:08.060
and my big sister, trina.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.090
Keep goin'.

08:09.160 --> 08:09.790
All right.

08:09.860 --> 08:10.790
Let's see.

08:12.060 --> 08:13.360
And there's my phone.

08:13.430 --> 08:14.160
Should I...?

08:14.230 --> 08:15.330
Answer it.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.330
Okay.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.940
Oh, it's my aunt sonya.

08:22.010 --> 08:22.300
Hey, you.

08:24.210 --> 08:25.910
Sorry, I have the hiccups.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.410
Uh... no, my parents aren't home.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.280
Yeah, you should come over.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.950
I know, I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.380
Hey, how's little ankimo?

08:34.450 --> 08:36.250
Last month, she got this
new puppy named ankimo,

08:36.320 --> 08:38.919
and he is the cutest thing ever.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.860
Wait, you're putting the
puppy on the phone?

08:40.919 --> 08:44.490
She's putting the puppy on the phone.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.530
Hi puppy, hi baby.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.870
Aw, you want me to tickle your tummy?

08:50.930 --> 08:53.270
Maybe you should wrap up the puppy talk.

08:53.340 --> 08:54.170
Right, sorry.

08:55.140 --> 08:58.310
Aunt sonya, I gotta...
wait, you bought the car?

08:58.380 --> 08:58.970
No way.

08:59.040 --> 08:59.980
Does mom know?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.880
Okay, okay, I won't tell her.

09:02.950 --> 09:04.250
All right, love you, miss you.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.410
Muahh!

09:05.480 --> 09:06.980
Later.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.380
Okay, so now what?

09:08.450 --> 09:09.120
Bwaahh!

09:09.190 --> 09:11.420
Aah.

09:11.490 --> 09:12.660
Dude, why scare me like that?

09:12.720 --> 09:13.690
It gets rid of the hiccups...

09:14.720 --> 09:19.800
Sometimes.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.060
I didn't yank festus's broom.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.800
All I said I was hungry, and
I just wanted a tamale.

09:22.870 --> 09:23.870
I was just trying to enjoy my tamale.

09:23.930 --> 09:24.500
Stop it.

09:24.570 --> 09:27.500
Trina came up and tried to take my tamale.

09:27.570 --> 09:34.010
Oh, oh!

09:34.080 --> 09:36.110
You two were fighting,
and you yanked festus

09:36.180 --> 09:39.110
right out of his grub truck,
and now he's in the hospital.

09:39.180 --> 09:41.750
I just wanted a tamale.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.190
Well, you went and broke
his tamale makin' arm.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.490
So, now what?

09:45.560 --> 09:46.590
We're sorry.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.790
Yeah, well until festus
is outta the hospital,

09:48.860 --> 09:50.460
you two are gonna work the grub truck.

09:50.530 --> 09:51.090
Gross!

09:51.160 --> 09:51.460
Trina.

09:51.530 --> 09:52.700
I'm not gonna... why should I...?

09:52.760 --> 09:57.200
Waaaaaeeehhhh!

09:57.270 --> 09:59.200
Come on, the man got hurt.

09:59.270 --> 10:01.570
The least we can do is work
the guy's truck for him.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.940
Easy for you to say.

10:03.010 --> 10:06.680
You don't have $40 manicure.

10:06.740 --> 10:17.550
Don't I?

10:17.620 --> 10:18.420
Hey.

10:18.490 --> 10:19.220
Hey, shut up.

10:19.290 --> 10:20.560
You people are animals.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.390
I'm doing the best I can.

10:22.460 --> 10:23.360
Did you say a hamburger?

10:23.430 --> 10:24.530
Hey Robbie,

10:27.430 --> 10:28.160
we're friends.

10:28.230 --> 10:29.100
Remember us?

10:29.170 --> 10:33.070
No, I'm not Andy samberg.

10:33.140 --> 10:34.170
Please.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.840
That didn't go well.

10:36.910 --> 10:38.070
You wanna pick up a pizza?

10:38.140 --> 10:38.540
Sure.

10:38.610 --> 10:39.210
I'll call Omar's.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.010
You got cash?

10:40.080 --> 10:40.710
In my locker.

10:40.780 --> 10:41.640
Back in a beat.

10:41.710 --> 10:49.620
Okay.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.220
Uh... hey, guys.

10:51.290 --> 10:51.990
Ignore us.

10:52.060 --> 10:52.560
Just keep doin'

10:52.620 --> 10:53.590
what you're doin'.

10:53.660 --> 10:57.030
All right, I'm just callin' Omar's
pizza 'cause the grub truck...

10:57.090 --> 10:58.530
Oh, hey, Omar.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.260
Hey, what's up?

10:59.330 --> 11:00.200
It's Beck.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.200
So, guess what I want?

11:02.270 --> 11:04.630
No, no, an extra large pizza.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.770
Aww!

11:05.840 --> 11:07.300
Trina poked me with a big fork.

11:07.370 --> 11:11.140
Look.

11:11.210 --> 11:18.280
Poke her back.

11:18.350 --> 11:20.450
So, what's on the Grande supreme?

11:20.520 --> 11:24.050
Oh, that sounds pretty good,
except for the onions.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.620
Yeah, my girlfriend's not gonna like that.

11:26.690 --> 11:28.560
Can you leave those off?

11:28.630 --> 11:29.830
You are the best.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.960
So, can you have that ready in 15?

11:32.030 --> 11:33.860
You make me happy.

11:33.930 --> 11:36.100
Yeah, okay, I'll be there soon.

11:36.170 --> 11:37.100
Yeah, okay.

11:37.170 --> 11:38.030
Bye.

11:38.100 --> 11:38.670
Ouch!

11:38.740 --> 11:41.200
I am telling you, Robbie, I am
not going to put up with this.

11:41.270 --> 11:43.170
Trina, what are you doing?

11:43.240 --> 11:43.810
Listen I...

11:43.870 --> 11:47.060
- I am not putting up with this anymore.
- This is crazy.

11:51.920 --> 11:58.550
Gettin' ready to sneak a peek at The Wood! Lemonade for Beck.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.470
Feeling: Antsy.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.900
Your lemonade, sir.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.260
Thanks.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.030
Hey.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.530
Why is it pink?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.240
It's pink lemonade.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.340
I've never seen any pink lemons.

12:16.410 --> 12:18.640
There are no pink lemons.

12:18.710 --> 12:20.640
So, what makes it pink?

12:20.710 --> 12:25.210
Well, you know, it's... it's a... shut up.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.350
Hi.

12:26.420 --> 12:27.980
Hey, guess what we got.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.850
I don't care.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.520
C'mon.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.220
We got an advance
copy of "the wood."

12:32.290 --> 12:32.820
First episode.

12:32.890 --> 12:33.690
Wanna watch it with us?

12:33.760 --> 12:36.060
No, they rejected me.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.890
I know, but I'm in it.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.600
Yeah, I gotta go change a lightbulb.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.860
All right, let's view this.

12:41.930 --> 12:42.800
Crank it.

12:42.870 --> 12:43.470
Wait.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.330
Don't you wanna wait for Jade?

12:44.400 --> 12:44.970
Jade's here.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.600
I'm here.

12:47.670 --> 12:48.170
Wait.

12:48.240 --> 12:48.940
When did you get here?

12:49.010 --> 12:50.670
Half hour ago.

12:50.740 --> 12:52.070
Well, where have you been?

12:52.140 --> 12:53.380
In your room.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.780
You've a lot of things in there.

12:58.850 --> 12:59.780
Wait, but why.

12:59.850 --> 13:02.790
I don't... I don't... so, let's see it.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.220
Here we go.

13:04.290 --> 13:09.930
Ohh.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.530
Welcome to "the wood."

13:11.590 --> 13:13.600
Hollywood.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.170
At this performing arts high
school, Hollywood arts,

13:16.230 --> 13:18.330
you can find good drama on stage.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.270
But the best drama happens off stage.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.640
Beck and Jade have been
dating for two years.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.710
Uchh, yeah, shoot me from that angle.

13:28.780 --> 13:29.750
You look great.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.410
I know.

13:32.480 --> 13:38.320
But is Beck getting tired
of the same old thing?

13:38.390 --> 13:39.720
Hey, it's Beck.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.460
Hi, baby.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.830
What's up?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.290
My parents aren't home.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.100
Oh, that sounds pretty good.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.200
I know, I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

13:49.270 --> 13:53.900
So, guess what I want aw, you
want me to tickle your tummy?

13:53.970 --> 13:55.070
Yeah, sure.

13:55.140 --> 13:56.740
You should come over.

13:56.810 --> 13:59.010
Yeah, my girlfriend's not gonna like that.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.680
I won't tell her.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.780
Okay, I'll be there soon.

14:01.850 --> 14:03.580
All right, love you, miss you.

14:03.650 --> 14:04.880
You make me happy.

14:04.950 --> 14:07.220
Muaahh!

14:07.280 --> 14:07.980
Bye.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.220
Later.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.520
Man. This so was good.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:25.240 --> 14:26.710
Get her off, get her off.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.310
Stop it.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.750
Get off!

14:30.810 --> 14:32.280
Okay.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.480
That phone conversation never happened.

14:34.550 --> 14:35.550
I saw it.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.660
I need some more pink lemonade.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.090
That phone call between
Beck and me wasn't real.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.790
You offered to tickle his tummy.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.360
I was talking to a puppy.

14:44.430 --> 14:46.460
I was ordering a pizza.

14:46.530 --> 14:49.370
How did she know you like
having your tummy tickled?

14:49.430 --> 14:53.240
Everyone likes having their tummy tickled.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.340
It's true.

14:56.410 --> 15:01.210
Sometimes, I do it to myself.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.180
The producers took two
separate phone conversations

15:04.250 --> 15:05.520
and cut 'em together.

15:05.580 --> 15:08.550
I wanna hear that from them.

15:08.620 --> 15:12.760
Yeah, we took two separate phone
calls and cut 'em together.

15:12.820 --> 15:16.590
Pretty cool, right?

15:16.660 --> 15:17.760
Cool?

15:17.830 --> 15:19.100
She almost killed me.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.830
I wouldn't have actually killed you.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.430
Well, aren't you sweet?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.740
Isn't "the wood" supposed
to be a reality show?

15:25.800 --> 15:26.300
Yeah.

15:26.370 --> 15:27.100
Uh-huh.

15:27.170 --> 15:31.040
But the phone call you guys cut
together, that wasn't real.

15:31.110 --> 15:34.540
So?

15:34.610 --> 15:36.910
Almost nothing is real in reality shows.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.010
It's entertainment.

15:38.080 --> 15:38.850
Drama.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.190
Our job as producers is to
take the footage we get

15:42.250 --> 15:44.290
and make it into something
people wanna watch.

15:44.350 --> 15:46.220
Yeah, we get that, but... look.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.420
You guys go to this school 'cause you wanna

15:47.490 --> 15:49.090
entertain people, right?

15:49.160 --> 15:49.660
Yeah.

15:49.730 --> 15:50.230
So?

15:50.290 --> 15:50.660
Okay.

15:50.730 --> 15:53.730
Well, this is no different than
being in a play... or a movie.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.960
It's acting.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.270
Just without a script.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.500
So, like improv.

15:57.570 --> 15:58.330
Exactly.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.500
Thank you.

16:00.570 --> 16:02.270
Well, you coulda told us that.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.510
Before the attempted murder.

16:03.570 --> 16:04.910
Don't be so dramatic.

16:04.980 --> 16:09.780
No, be more dramatic.

16:09.850 --> 16:11.780
And the next time that you
two have a girl fight,

16:11.850 --> 16:15.320
could you call us first,
so we can get it on video?

16:15.390 --> 16:20.860
Or they could re-enact it.

16:20.920 --> 16:25.260
♪ Action ♪

16:25.330 --> 16:26.230

Okay, that is one chicken Caesar wrap.

16:48.490 --> 16:49.350
Yum.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.950
One tuna wrap.

16:51.020 --> 16:51.950
Thank you.

16:52.020 --> 16:56.690
And a very pretty veggie burger
for a very pretty mouth to chew.

17:01.330 --> 17:04.200
Wait, this is a coupon for lady soap!

17:04.270 --> 17:06.040
I can't accept this.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.200
You have to pay in cash!

17:07.270 --> 17:08.770
Shut up!

17:08.839 --> 17:11.310
Okay, I'll make it work.

17:11.380 --> 17:18.550
Thanks.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.550
Y'know, you're supposed to be helping.

17:20.619 --> 17:22.950
Excuse me, but I'm the one who figured out

17:23.020 --> 17:24.720
how to use the deep fryer.

17:24.790 --> 17:25.560
Great.

17:25.619 --> 17:29.290
What'd ya fry?

17:29.360 --> 17:31.230
Rex's foot.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.130
What?

17:32.200 --> 17:33.160
You did not.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.230
Oh-oh.

17:34.300 --> 17:37.630
Ohh!!

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
Unbelievable, man.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.700
No, you're unbelievable,
'cause you always gotta make

17:40.770 --> 17:42.040
a big deal outta nothing.

17:42.110 --> 17:44.370
You trashed my beach house.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.440
You said I could use your beach house.

17:46.510 --> 17:48.180
I didn't say people could puke on my carpet

17:48.250 --> 17:50.710
and make soup in my toilet.

17:50.780 --> 17:52.380
It was a beach house party.

17:52.450 --> 17:55.280
What'd you think was gonna happen?

17:55.350 --> 17:57.620
Who put my dog in a wedding dress?

17:57.690 --> 17:58.990
It was hilarious.

17:59.060 --> 17:59.790
You know what?

17:59.860 --> 18:00.520
This friendship is over.

18:00.590 --> 18:01.620
Eat a rag.

18:01.690 --> 18:04.990
You eat two rags.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.300
You get all that?

18:06.360 --> 18:07.030
Got it.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.600
Really good stuff, guys.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.200
Nice work, man.

18:09.270 --> 18:11.000
Well played.

18:11.070 --> 18:12.340
We'll give you more stuff later.

18:12.400 --> 18:12.670
Cool.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.910
Wow, they were great.

18:16.970 --> 18:17.940
We can do better.

18:18.010 --> 18:19.240
Whatcha got?

18:19.310 --> 18:25.780
Okay, what if mister janitor got
us in trouble for something

18:25.850 --> 18:30.020
and we got so peed-off about it
that we uh... maybe take our anger

18:30.090 --> 18:32.460
out on his car?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.620
We can't trash the janitor's car.

18:34.690 --> 18:38.390
He got us those cute little
chocolate mops for Valentine's day.

18:38.460 --> 18:42.060
We don't trash his real car.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.170
My dad's boss owns a junkyard.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.140
We get him to drop off a
piece a'junk car here,

18:46.200 --> 18:47.970
and we wreck that one.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.470
And say it's the janitor's car.

18:50.540 --> 18:52.310
Oh, wow, I wish I'd thought of that.

18:52.380 --> 18:56.480
Oh right, I did.

18:56.550 --> 18:59.020
Wait, that janitor didn't
give me a chocolate mop

18:59.080 --> 19:00.680
for Valentine's day.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.790
He didn't?

19:02.850 --> 19:16.030
Ha-ha.

19:16.900 --> 19:21.440
What did you want!

19:21.510 --> 19:23.840
No, I'm not Andy samberg.

19:23.910 --> 19:28.710
What'd you call m I can't
take this pressure.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.610
Okay, they want food?

19:30.680 --> 19:32.480
Let's give 'em food.

19:32.550 --> 19:33.720
Eat that!

19:33.780 --> 19:34.050
Yeah.

19:34.120 --> 19:34.820
Eat that.

19:34.890 --> 19:35.550
Eat that.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.220
Eat that!

19:36.290 --> 19:38.250
Eat that. Take that.

19:38.320 --> 19:38.850
How 'bout a burger?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.020
How 'bout a burger?

19:40.120 --> 19:40.660
I don't care.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.260
I don't care.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.530
Where's the junker car?

19:43.590 --> 19:47.130
Uh... the guy says he dropped
it off in the north corner

19:47.200 --> 19:52.440
of the parking lot.

19:52.500 --> 19:57.170
There it is.

to come to the parking lot

20:11.460 --> 20:14.460

stuff about to go down.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.790
And quit sniffing me.

Oh, we're so glad to see you.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.250
We're sorry we injured you.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.520
You're a nice man.

20:44.590 --> 20:50.360
Camera crew is here.

20:50.430 --> 20:53.830
Let's fake some reality tv.

20:53.900 --> 20:58.500
Action.

20:58.570 --> 21:02.040
This is what happens when a school
janitor gets us in trouble.

21:02.110 --> 21:05.170
Janitor's car...
Feel the wrath.

21:11.250 --> 21:14.520

21:20.890 --> 21:21.860
Your car?

21:21.930 --> 21:24.630
What is goin' on here?

21:24.690 --> 21:28.060
Um, we were wrecking this junker
car for the show... "The wood."

21:28.130 --> 21:29.030
Keep goin'.

21:29.100 --> 21:29.600
No.

21:29.670 --> 21:33.700
Shut up, buddy.

21:33.770 --> 21:37.910
This is festus' car.

21:37.970 --> 21:40.740
You said some guy dropped off
this junker car for us to whack.

21:40.810 --> 21:46.580
Yeah, he must have meant that one.

21:46.650 --> 21:50.250
Aw, man, we abused the wrong car.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.090
All right.

21:51.150 --> 21:52.960
Tv people, out.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.220
But we've got a show to make.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.030
Then go make it at another school.

21:56.090 --> 21:57.360
You all are done here.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.030
You can't kick us out, man.

21:59.100 --> 21:59.630

21:59.700 --> 22:01.030

22:02.800 --> 22:04.400

22:04.470 --> 22:06.000
There's other schools.

22:06.070 --> 22:11.440
Let's go to one.

22:11.510 --> 22:17.350
Go call a tow truck for festus' car.

22:17.410 --> 22:20.220
Now, how am I gonna get home?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.450
Oh, don't worry, festus.

22:22.520 --> 22:30.030

22:30.090 --> 22:32.290
This is so slow.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.860
Oh, come on, festus, it's not that bad.

22:34.930 --> 22:36.300
My car has a radio.

22:36.370 --> 22:38.170
So, what do you want us to do about it?

22:38.240 --> 22:41.770
