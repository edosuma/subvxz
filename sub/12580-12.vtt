Connie, can you hear me?
Joseph, can you hear me?

00:36.302 --> 00:40.136
Joseph, can you hear Connie?
Connie, can you hear Joseph?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.931
People, we have conference calling!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.010
[sighing]

00:44.110 --> 00:45.600
Bobby Hill, put down that phone!

00:45.712 --> 00:47.873
The school could be calling me in to sub
any minute.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.779
What if an algebra teacher
died in a car accident, huh?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.580
It would be a tragedy
if they couldn't reach me.

00:53.686 --> 00:54.653
[telephone ringing]

00:54.821 --> 00:56.789
Peggy Hill, Education Solutions.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.917
I am on my way.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.967
I'm your substitute teacher,
Mrs. Peggy Hill.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.037
And you are in for a treat...

01:11.538 --> 01:13.438
from my friend...

01:13.873 --> 01:15.670
Benjamin Franklin!

01:15.775 --> 01:18.300
It was a cloudy day.
And I decided that I would--

01:18.411 --> 01:19.378
[door opening]

01:19.479 --> 01:22.710
-Morning, Mrs. Bonter.
-Morning, class.

01:22.982 --> 01:26.349
Sorry to drag you out of the house, Peggy.
The cable guy came early.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.286
Peggy? I'm Benjamin Franklin.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.814
You'll still get paid.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.495
I do not do this for the money, Erica...

01:36.596 --> 01:39.724
although I wouldn't mind
getting reimbursed for the wig.

01:42.135 --> 01:45.468
""A penny saved is a penny earned.""
Try and follow that.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.472
[thunder cracking]

01:47.574 --> 01:48.939
[keys jingling]

01:50.076 --> 01:51.202
(Bobby)
Come on, faster!

01:51.311 --> 01:52.300
Bobby.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.379
[tires skidding]

01:54.147 --> 01:58.550
How would you like to fly a kite
and learn the key to electricity?

01:58.651 --> 01:59.709
No time!

01:59.819 --> 02:01.650
Word is,
there's a truckload of dead chickens...

02:01.754 --> 02:03.085
floating down the river.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.089
I hope we're not too late.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.189
My keys!

02:09.294 --> 02:10.387
[thunder rumbling]

02:10.530 --> 02:11.588
[grunting]

02:11.798 --> 02:12.765
Damn!

02:12.899 --> 02:13.991
(Bill)
If you're locked out...

02:14.100 --> 02:16.534
you can stay at my house
until Hank gets home.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.633
We could rent a movie.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.700
I'll just sit here
until the wind blows my keys back.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.337
[thunder cracking]

02:31.851 --> 02:34.285
All right, people. Save the lmperiales first.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.720
HANK: This is when heroes are made.
MAN: Let's go.

02:38.858 --> 02:39.916
Hank, bad news.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.688
I just figured out
who's been stealing office supplies.

02:42.795 --> 02:43.955
It's Donna.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.822
Found them in her bedroom.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.661
Good detective work, sir.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.258
Yeah, well,
I was getting tired of her anyway.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.998
So, it looks like you gotta find us
a new Donna.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.199
Make sure you find one
that isn't always asking...

02:55.308 --> 02:57.606
""What are you thinking about?""

03:00.747 --> 03:03.045
It was my first call in three months.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.276
Damn anti-bacterial soap.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.280
Nobody's getting sick anymore.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.220
I shouldn't have to sneeze
in the faculty-lounge coffee machine...

03:10.323 --> 03:12.257
just to get a chance to teach.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.950
It is beneath me.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.685
Hey, Peggy...

03:15.795 --> 03:18.559
how would you like to come
to work with me at Strickland?

03:18.665 --> 03:21.566
-Thank you, but no.
-Come on. It'd be fun.

03:21.768 --> 03:25.033
You and me working side by side
at Strickland Propane.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.934
This could be fate talking.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.335
We don't fire Buck's mistresses every day.

03:29.442 --> 03:32.309
But I wouldn't be teaching,
I would be doing.

03:32.478 --> 03:36.676
And I wasn't ""Substitute Doer of the Year""
three years in a row.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.545
I see where I'm going with this.

03:40.653 --> 03:44.851
It is time for me to find
and accept a full-time teaching position.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.926
Just come to Strickland, Peggy.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.286
Come on. Come on.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.021
Come on.

03:51.130 --> 03:54.099
Hank, this obviously means a lot
to you. So...

03:54.200 --> 03:57.397
I will make you a promise
I know I will not have to keep.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.267
If I cannot find a full-time job...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.898
I will come work with you at Strickland.

04:03.009 --> 04:03.976
Great.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.308
I'll put in the paperwork
for a coffee mug with your name on it.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.675
Worst-case scenario,
it'll be your Christmas present.

04:10.783 --> 04:11.977
[children chattering]

04:12.218 --> 04:14.550
Principal Moss, I have great news.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.348
I am ready to teach full-time. That's right.

04:17.457 --> 04:21.791
From 9:00 to 3:00, five days a week,
35 weeks a year.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.787
Would if I could, Peggy.

04:23.896 --> 04:26.797
But we're in the middle
of a state-wide hiring freeze.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.464
Well, surely they have to make exceptions.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.334
If you want, I'd be glad
to forward this résumé to the governor.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.066
Sorry. Good luck, Peggy.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.443
And this, class,
is a stegosaurus, which is--

04:40.546 --> 04:43.947
Which is Latin for ""covered lizard.""

04:44.183 --> 04:47.346
And just because his name is ""O'Saurus""...

04:47.453 --> 04:49.614
that does not make him lrish.

04:49.722 --> 04:50.814
[laughing]

04:53.026 --> 04:55.893
And my résumé for you. I'm very good.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.957
I also teach Spanish,
as well as Math, grades four and under.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.896
(Peggy)
Nope. Taken.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.744
(principal) We have learned so much
from her here on earth.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.871
I know she'll continue teaching
up in heaven. Amen.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.673
(all)
Amen.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.977
[birds chirping]

05:21.721 --> 05:24.884
Beautiful words, Principal.
Very, very moving.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.959
Have you filled her position yet?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.995
-She retired 10 years ago.
-Oh.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.696
Well, your obituary was very misleading.

05:35.768 --> 05:38.862
Okay then.
I suppose we should start with lesson one.

05:39.105 --> 05:42.871
Lesson one. This is the Wagner Char King.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.739
This is the Char King lmperiale.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.114
I almost forgot.

05:50.216 --> 05:54.949
You are hereby requisitioned
three Strickland Propane pens.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.214
These can never, ever leave the office.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.722
Sorry to be a spoilsport,
but Donna ruined it for everyone.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.522
Hey, Peggy. Welcome aboard.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.393
You told her about the pens, right?

06:06.499 --> 06:08.694
Yes. I am aware of the pen situation.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.933
Just so you don't hear it
from anyone else...

06:12.038 --> 06:14.802
I'm sleeping with the new employee.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.235
[laughing]

06:16.876 --> 06:18.173
Hank, we got a code green.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.802
They're running low on propane
at the WhatABurger.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.574
Actually, that's a code yellow, sir.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.879
Yeah, whatever. It's your dumb system.
You figure it out.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.879
Peggy, we are going out
on your first propane run.

06:30.022 --> 06:32.684
Get your jacket and hat.
Heck, get your camera.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.958
Look at us. Husband and wife
selling propane together.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.489
It's like something out of the movies.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.764
When you lift,
always remember to use your legs.

06:44.871 --> 06:45.838
I know.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.101
It might be a few minutes.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.973
Tony the manager'll probably want
to talk about his new grease traps.

06:54.847 --> 06:58.874
-Peggy Hill?
-Well, hello, Claire.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.450
""Strickland Propane""?

07:01.854 --> 07:04.084
Have you gotten out
of the teaching game?

07:04.190 --> 07:07.717
[laughing] Oh, no, Claire.
Quite the opposite.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.352
I have decided to teach full-time.

07:10.463 --> 07:13.990
In fact,
I'm doing location scouting for field trips.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.526
Just a minute.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.533
No, this parking lot is no good.
So, what are you doing here?

07:21.641 --> 07:25.407
My cousin got me an interview
for a teaching job over at Saint lgnatius.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.204
-Oh, really? Full-time?
-Maybe.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.178
I see you are wearing your huaraches.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.847
Is the teaching position for Español?

07:37.056 --> 07:39.820
Es posible, Wish me luck.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.756
It's Spanish.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.088
Hank...

07:45.198 --> 07:47.996
I thought maybe
I could show some initiative...

07:48.100 --> 07:50.295
and canvass the area
with Strickland flyers.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.964
You remind me of a young me.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.666
Just a little tip.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.833
I like to put them in face down.

07:56.943 --> 08:00.310
That way, when they get in
the driver's seat, bam! There it is.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.491
[children chattering]

08:20.566 --> 08:22.693
Peggy, what are you doing here?

08:22.802 --> 08:25.362
I just wanted to see
how your interview went.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.199
Well, it may have been
the best interview of my life...

08:28.307 --> 08:31.367
right up until they said
they'd really rather hire a nun.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.876
Just being celibate isn't enough.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.110
[children chattering]

08:49.996 --> 08:51.964
-Who's next?
-I am.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.894
Sister Peggy Hill.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.334
So, may I see your résumé?

09:02.475 --> 09:05.467
Oh, well, my résumé is...

09:05.611 --> 09:10.378
is written on the smiling faces
of the children of El Salvador...

09:10.716 --> 09:13.378
where I did my most recent nunning.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.475
You know what?

09:14.587 --> 09:17.613
I have free international calling
on my cellular telephone.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.351
Why don't I just give them
a jingle-jangle and get a reference?

09:20.459 --> 09:22.450
Oh, yes. That would be great.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.498
Except my order
just took a permanent vow of silence.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.261
And if you ask me,
not a moment too soon, huh?

09:29.368 --> 09:31.131
Yakety-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.226
Sister Peggy...

09:32.338 --> 09:35.830
this school could really use a teacher
with your qualifications. But I'm afraid--

09:35.942 --> 09:39.036
Mother Superior,
do you know what a calling is?

09:39.879 --> 09:44.475
All of my life I've had a calling to teach.
This is my life's work.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.984
But without a résumé or references--

09:47.086 --> 09:50.351
I do come with a reference,
the best there is.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.053
He doesn't have a telephone or a fax...

09:53.626 --> 09:56.857
but I believe he is listed in the Book.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.888

Up, down, left, right.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.599
[door opening]

10:43.042 --> 10:46.307
Peggy, someone found these flyers
in a dumpster.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.744
Now, I have a hard time imagining that...

10:48.848 --> 10:51.316
500 people took them off
their windshields...

10:51.684 --> 10:54.414
collected them into a neat pile,
and threw them away.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.748
-Call me cynical--
-Well, yes.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.324
I may have advertently thrown them away.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.655
I am a terrible Strickland employee.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.857
-I quit.
-Quit?

11:03.963 --> 11:05.828
Well, I was just gonna let you off
with a warning...

11:05.931 --> 11:07.398
and monitor your performance.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.468
Hank, I have great news.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.969
I just got my dream job
teaching Spanish full-time...

11:13.072 --> 11:15.267
at Saint lgnatius Catholic School.

11:15.374 --> 11:18.343
But you already have a dream job.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.344
Junior grill associate
at Strickland Propane.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.780
Hank, I am thrilled with me.
Why can't you be?

11:24.884 --> 11:29.617
Okay, fine. Go teach.
Propane sells itself. Doesn't need you.

11:29.722 --> 11:30.689
[bell gonging]

11:31.290 --> 11:35.021
Bueios días, Me llamo Mrs....

11:37.396 --> 11:40.092
Sister Peggy...

11:42.268 --> 11:43.292
...a nun.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.362
Can anyone tell me what this is?

11:47.473 --> 11:48.633
In Español,

11:48.841 --> 11:50.433
[speaking Spanish]

11:51.210 --> 11:52.370
[speaking Spanish]

11:52.611 --> 11:53.942

[speaking Spanish]

11:56.716 --> 11:57.774
[all gasping]

11:59.051 --> 12:03.351
Oh, children. The only one
who should be afraid of the ruler...

12:03.456 --> 12:05.856
is Señor Piñata.

12:06.959 --> 12:07.926
[all gasping]

12:08.027 --> 12:09.289
[children chattering]

12:09.862 --> 12:11.329
Okay, my turn.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.822
Tongue-kiss a lizard...

12:13.933 --> 12:16.697
or take a shower in Bill's bathroom?

12:17.103 --> 12:18.502
-Lizard.
-The lizard, man.

12:18.604 --> 12:23.268
Why is the other choice always
""take a shower in Bill's bathroom?""

12:23.509 --> 12:27.741
Adios, If I'm home late, it'll be because
my new students are so engrossed...

12:27.847 --> 12:29.610
they will not let me leave.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.774
Yep, I will be home late.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.852
Well, I'm gonna be home on time...

12:33.953 --> 12:37.389
Iike always, because Strickland
is a well-oiled machine.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.053
Well, I guess
we're just different that way, Hank.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.923
I need excitement to feel excited.

12:43.028 --> 12:43.995
[car door closing]

12:46.165 --> 12:49.532
Here's one. Put a wasp up your nose...

12:49.635 --> 12:51.762
or take a shower in Bill's bathroom?

12:53.572 --> 12:56.700
[singing in Spanish]

13:00.112 --> 13:01.477
[bell ringing]

13:03.015 --> 13:05.916
Sister Peggy,
will you come play kickball with us?

13:06.018 --> 13:10.614
All right. But I am not playing catcher.
I have kneeled enough for one day.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.551
So, how's your first week going?

13:16.662 --> 13:18.493
Oh, Mother Superior...

13:18.597 --> 13:21.065
thank you so much
for giving me this chance.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.728
This is easily the most rewarding job
I have ever had.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.705
More rewarding than teaching
crippled children to walk in El Salvador?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.207
Tons more.

13:30.376 --> 13:33.243
Well, I couldn't be
more pleased with your work.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.380
As a matter of fact, I've assigned you...

13:35.481 --> 13:37.540
to cover
my Principles of Catholicism class...

13:37.650 --> 13:38.708
next period.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.185
-Principles of Catholicism?
-It's only for a couple of weeks.

13:42.288 --> 13:46.418
I can't get out of jury duty.
It's my own fault for registering to vote.

13:46.525 --> 13:50.859
Well, thank you so much.
But religion's not really my subject.

13:50.963 --> 13:53.363
[laughing]
Oh, not your subject!

13:53.599 --> 13:55.362
You're gonna replace
Sister Mary Catherine...

13:55.467 --> 13:57.230
as the cutup around here.

14:02.975 --> 14:03.942
So....

14:04.510 --> 14:07.308
Let's see, what was the last thing
you were studying...

14:07.413 --> 14:08.846
with the Mother Superior?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.642
-Transubstantiation.
-Trans what now?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.479
Transubstantiation.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.481
Oh. Okay.

14:15.955 --> 14:19.584
Tell you what.
Why don't we just rap about God?

14:19.692 --> 14:24.254
Sister Peggy, I have a question.
Does God have a last name?

14:24.396 --> 14:25.363
Well...

14:25.798 --> 14:28.665
I would have to say no.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.193
He only has one name, like Cher.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.292
[students murmuring]

14:32.404 --> 14:36.966
Sister Peggy, if cats can't pray,
do they still go to heaven?

14:37.109 --> 14:41.512
Well, now, I'm not sure where I heard this,
but all dogs go to heaven...

14:41.614 --> 14:44.014
so I am sure that cats do not.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.673
[students murmuring]

14:46.452 --> 14:49.580
Come on. Keep them coming.
Let's see who can stump the sister.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.155
Bobby, sorry I did not have time
to make you lunch this morning...

14:53.259 --> 14:55.887
but maybe you can trade
this can of beets for something, huh?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.326
You know, Donna had plenty of time
to make her kids lunch...

14:59.431 --> 15:01.194
and she was robbing us blind.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.326
-Hank, when are you going to quit sulking?
-I don't know...

15:04.436 --> 15:07.030
but when I do,
I'll give you two weeks' notice...

15:07.139 --> 15:08.766
which is more than you gave me.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.306
All right, you're disappointed. I get it.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.346
You know how the smell of propane
gives you goose bumps?

15:15.447 --> 15:18.883
For me,
it is the smell of children learning Spanish.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.050
I wish you could open your nose
to my passion.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.515
[sighing]

15:24.957 --> 15:28.188
And you never believed
in my comedy career either!

15:34.133 --> 15:35.998
Billy. There you go.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.860
-There.
-Sister Peggy...

15:38.971 --> 15:41.804
I dropped my practice wafer on the floor.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.805
Five-second rule.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.777
Excuse me, Sister.
I'm looking for.... Peggy?

15:48.180 --> 15:49.579
Holy crap!

15:54.653 --> 15:55.711
What are you wearing?

15:55.821 --> 15:59.621
It is called a habit, sir, and you are drunk.

16:01.660 --> 16:06.188
I'll be right back. Danny, lead the room
in a game of Bible hangman.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.104
All right.
I am going to be straight with you.

16:14.206 --> 16:18.108
I'm not really a nun.
I am only pretending to be a nun...

16:18.210 --> 16:19.541
so I can teach here.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.240
You would rather live a lie
than sell an honest day's gas?

16:23.349 --> 16:25.579
Hank, this is the best job I have ever had.

16:25.684 --> 16:29.120
I feel like I'm really making a difference
in my students' lives.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.052
You're impersonating a nun!

16:31.156 --> 16:33.852
With the gajillion things
that are right about this...

16:33.959 --> 16:36.553
you zoom right in on the one negative.

16:37.429 --> 16:41.798
It's not like I'm dressing up as a rabbi
and circumcising people left and right.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.765
And people do that, you know.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.598
[sighing] At least when Whoopi Goldberg
posed as a nun...

16:46.705 --> 16:48.400
she was running from gangsters!

16:49.875 --> 16:51.069
[gasping]

16:52.277 --> 16:54.245
[choir siigiig]

17:04.656 --> 17:05.884
[screamiig]

17:09.694 --> 17:11.492
[speakiig Spaiish]

17:12.798 --> 17:16.858
Oh, please!
A real priest would never do that.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.199
Oh, this is the worst show ever.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.271
Is it another flashback episode?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.136
I know anger is a sin...

17:23.242 --> 17:26.336
but it really steams me
that kids could watch this show...

17:26.444 --> 17:28.743
and think it represents
the teachings of the Catholic Church.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.748
Oh, so the moiseñor
kills a few people here and there.

17:31.850 --> 17:35.377
I say whatever gets people
talking about Catholicism...

17:35.487 --> 17:36.647
is a good thing.

17:36.755 --> 17:39.519
Sister, our children's souls are at stake.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.616
What if one of your students
watched an episode...

17:41.727 --> 17:43.456
and spit sacramental wine?

17:43.562 --> 17:46.258
Or used a communion wafer
as a ninja throwing star?

17:46.365 --> 17:48.265
Okay. Say those are sins.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.232
It's nothing
a confession with Father McCleary...

17:50.335 --> 17:51.461
couldn't take care of.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.401
I hear he can fix anything.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.063
Oh, he is good.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.939
Sister Peggy, if the children are confused
with a lot of nonsense...

17:59.044 --> 18:02.480
they may lose their faith.
And you know how God punishes that.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.048
Eternal damnation.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.916
-Do you mean hell?
-Yep.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.852
So if you don't mind,
the Ladies Doral Open is on.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.816
[sighing]

18:18.230 --> 18:22.223
Sorry I'm late.
So what can I fill your little minds with?

18:22.334 --> 18:25.531
Sister Peggy, I really like going to church.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.071
Does that mean I can give it up for Lent?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.538
Well, I'm pretty sure God wouldn't like it.

18:31.643 --> 18:35.545
But what can he do?
You caught him in a technicality.

18:35.647 --> 18:36.841
Good for you.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.050
Now, who had that question
about birth control?

18:40.586 --> 18:41.917
[students screaming]

18:44.189 --> 18:45.281
[speaking Spanish]

18:47.025 --> 18:48.287
[students screaming]

19:06.578 --> 19:07.875
[screaming]

19:13.886 --> 19:16.320
I didn't know it was a sin!

19:17.089 --> 19:20.149
You leave her alone! It's not her fault!

19:24.129 --> 19:25.687
Oh, thank God!

19:25.797 --> 19:29.164
Sorry about that. Just be a second.

19:32.604 --> 19:36.233
That's a clean-burning hell, I tell you what!

19:36.375 --> 19:37.637
[laughing]

19:39.678 --> 19:41.077
No!

19:41.180 --> 19:43.375
Moiseñor, please! Please!

19:43.482 --> 19:46.781
I didn't mean to damn their mortal souls
for all of eternity!

19:46.885 --> 19:50.616
I just wanted a full-time job!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.624
Oh! Oh, God!

19:59.298 --> 20:00.265
Class...

20:00.499 --> 20:04.162
I have bad news for anyone
who did well on the last test.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.601
I.... Mother Superior?

20:07.839 --> 20:10.831
-What happened to jury duty?
-The trial's over.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.169
You just can't get a jury to convict
in this country.

20:14.646 --> 20:18.138
So, did you finish
the chapter on transubstantiation?

20:18.250 --> 20:20.047
Well, yes.

20:20.152 --> 20:24.555
But I think my take on the whole thing
might be a tad blasphemous.

20:25.824 --> 20:29.260
Mother Superior,
I have a confession to make.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.425
I am not a nun.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.425
I am a Methodist.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.626
[all gasping]

20:37.736 --> 20:39.328
Why would you do this?

20:39.438 --> 20:42.703
Because I love to teach,
not because I hate your religion.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.072
I want to be very clear about that.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.678
I want you out of here now.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.743
I hope that you can forgive me.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.740
I think you have to.

20:51.883 --> 20:52.850
[grunting]

20:59.958 --> 21:00.925
[sighing]

21:04.062 --> 21:05.324
What are you doing here?

21:05.430 --> 21:08.058
I made a promise. And I am keeping it.

21:08.767 --> 21:13.295
I couldn't find full-time teaching work,
so I'm here to begin my new life...

21:13.405 --> 21:15.430
as a junior grill associate.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.737
-They caught you, didn't they?
-No. I told them the truth.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.640
Working here is my penance.

21:20.746 --> 21:24.079
I gave it to myself
while I was still pretending to be a nun.

21:24.249 --> 21:27.685
So, working at Strickland
is like a punishment to you?

21:27.786 --> 21:30.084
Oh, I'm sorry, Hank.
I didn't mean it that way. I--

21:30.188 --> 21:33.351
No, I understand.
Teaching's what you love.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.188
Any other job
is gonna feel like a punishment.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.653
Peggy, you're fired.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.788
You mean it?

21:41.466 --> 21:44.401
When you finally do get
that full-time teaching job...

21:44.503 --> 21:46.528
here's something
you can keep your pencils in.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.538
Oh, Hank, you're the best.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.540
Of course, you know
it can't leave Strickland property.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.238
(boy)
Traisubstaitiatioi,

22:31.350 --> 22:32.374
(Peggy)
Trais what iow?
