WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:02.001
When you pulled the plug
on our relationship,

00:02.127 --> 00:04.253
I had to assume that
I'd never see you again.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.880
I need you to imagine
how tough it's been

00:06.006 --> 00:08.716
ever since I found out that
I'm carrying your baby.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.053
- Talk to me.
- I'm scared.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.180
- Of what?
- The future.

00:14.306 --> 00:17.558
I am moving a little fast. That's why
I want to let her know this is real.

00:18.102 --> 00:20.269
I should be allowed
to retake the challenge test,

00:20.396 --> 00:22.271
and believe me, I will not fail.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.524
Jones's spot is not an option for you.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.192
Doesn't 81 need a new candidate?

00:26.318 --> 00:28.903
You can't serve under Casey.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.074
What do you think about going out
two weeks from Saturday

00:33.200 --> 00:36.285
- on one of those dinner cruises?
- This is a disaster.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.789
- What?
- My firefighter test is on Friday,

00:39.915 --> 00:41.916
and I just found out that
Shay and I are scheduled

00:42.042 --> 00:43.376
for a payback shift the day before,

00:43.502 --> 00:45.086
for the girls' weekend
that we subbed out.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.546
I'm not going to make it to the test!

00:46.672 --> 00:50.341
Just talk to Chief, tell him you need to
leave early that day.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.593
- He'll make it work.
- What if he can't?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.555
He will. Deep breath, Gabby.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.766
You're going to make it to the test,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.269
and you're going to kick the test's ass.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.020
Yeah.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.648
If that actually happens...

01:07.443 --> 01:09.026
...I'm leaving 51.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.988
Yeah.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.658
Can't imagine that.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.493
Neither can I.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.998
But it's you and me,

01:22.124 --> 01:23.791
no matter what.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.964
It's pretty ironic.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.550
Not being able to get pregnant
was part of what broke up

01:32.676 --> 01:34.635
my marriage years ago.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.013
But that was for the best.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.848
It wasn't a good situation.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.684
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just rambling.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.771
But I just accepted that motherhood
wasn't going to happen for me.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.606
So this was a really big shock.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.281
The truth is, I can't stop feeling
like this is a gift.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.159
I understand that it is complicated,
and that we're coming at it

01:58.285 --> 02:01.704
- from two completely different places.
- Not that different.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.583
I didn't expect to be a father
at this age, either.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.752
It's a lot to think about.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.171
I want to give you, uh, time

02:10.297 --> 02:13.800
to consider how you want to be involved,
or even if...

02:13.926 --> 02:15.593
Donna,

02:15.719 --> 02:18.429
I want to be a part
of this child's life.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.098
I have no questions about that.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.018
Then you will be, of course.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.026
New union bylaws?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.778
No, this is a list of the items

02:33.904 --> 02:38.574
that will be available at my yard sale
this Saturday. Deals aplenty.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.785
What is a Makiyakinabe?

02:40.911 --> 02:44.330
A rectangular pan, used for
cooking Japanese omelets.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.708
In good, to eggs-cellent condition.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.044
Hey everybody.
This is Rick Newhouse.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.463
He'll be joining us
on Squad to replace Clarke.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.507
- Great to meet you guys.
- Where you from?

02:54.633 --> 02:57.885
Last job was Squad 6, South Side.
But I'm real happy to be here.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.720
Heard some great things about this crew.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.097
Welcome.

03:02.558 --> 03:05.601
Do we tell him the
"new guy at 51" job is jinxed?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.813
Maybe he'll be the one
to break the streak.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.191
The test is in five days, huh?

03:13.527 --> 03:14.986
Must have blocked it out.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.780
One second I feel a hundred percent
ready, and the next I'm panicking.

03:17.906 --> 03:22.076
Well, here's a possible solution...
You could just not take it.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.246
Sorry. You know I support you.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.331
It's just, what am I
going to do without you?

03:27.457 --> 03:29.542
It's one thing to go a few shifts,

03:29.668 --> 03:31.711
but you're my lead, my PIC.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.921
Look, you don't need me around
telling you what to do.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.049
And even if I do take the test, it's not
like I'm going to leave your life.

03:37.175 --> 03:40.094
I know that, but with
the new job, the new hub...

03:41.972 --> 03:44.348
...bub. All the new hubbub

03:44.474 --> 03:46.559
around you becoming
a firefighter, you know?

03:46.685 --> 03:48.477
The excitement, you know?

03:48.604 --> 03:52.857
Meanwhile I'll just still be here,
same ol' same ol'.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.984
Stop jinxing me, OK?
I haven't passed the test yet!

03:56.111 --> 03:58.487
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

03:58.614 --> 04:01.157
man injured... 4107 Logan Drive.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.253
Big branch got caught in the chipper.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.380
Ross tried to kick it loose,
but it snagged his pants

04:16.506 --> 04:17.757
- and pulled him in.
- How far?

04:17.883 --> 04:20.259
I tried to turn it over before you guys
showed up, but...

04:22.679 --> 04:24.096
Please get me out of here!

04:32.648 --> 04:35.149
Hold it!
You sure this thing's shut down?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.610
- Turned off the ignition myself.
- Not good enough.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.154
Herrmann, disconnect the battery.
Don't need any surprises.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.238
Got it, Chief!

04:42.407 --> 04:45.201
We need to remove the housing
to access the feed roller.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.827
Newhouse!

04:46.954 --> 04:49.121
Let's get to work.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.292
Power's off, Chief!

04:53.418 --> 04:55.169
OK. You take the lead on this.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.588
Ross, Ross,
I know that this hurts,

04:57.714 --> 04:59.173
but you have to try to stay still.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.467
Just tell me, am I
going to lose my legs?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.470
Ross, Ross...
We're going to get you out, OK?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.472
We need you to take
long, deep breaths.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.979
- What do you think?
- One leg is bleeding out.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.022
I'm gonna place a tourniquet
and get a line in.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.066
I need you to go to the ambo
and hang two bags of fluid

05:17.192 --> 05:19.068
- and put blood tubing on one of them.
- Copy that.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.321
The feed wheel is hydraulic. We're going
to need to power the saw to lift it.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.199
We can't risk starting the motor
again. It could pull his leg farther in.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.910
If we take out the motor
and disconnect the bearing guides,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.954
- we can move it manually.
- Let's do it.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.624
Fluids are good to go.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.626
Thanks. Ross, you're doing great.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.755
- How we doing, Kelly?
- We're almost there.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.093
- Ready, Casey?
- Yep.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.803
Got it!

05:45.929 --> 05:49.181
Ready on three...
One, two, three!

05:51.226 --> 05:54.478
Alright on three...
One, two, three!

06:01.153 --> 06:03.946
You took the lead on this one.
I'll drive.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.327
It's the crew from Austin.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.000
Hey, how's it going, 51?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.753
- Trimming trees?
- It was a crazy call, actually.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.838
A guy was stuck halfway
through a wood chipper.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.506
Yeah? You get him out alive?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.426
- Damn straight we did.
- Alright.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.679
Hey, Casey.
Hey, I was sorry to hear about your,

06:28.805 --> 06:30.890
uh, candidate,
Chief Jones's daughter, man.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.975
That's a terrible thing.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.061
Yeah, it was.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.105
Speaking of candidates...
I heard your paramedic Dawson

06:38.231 --> 06:40.274
was near the top of
her academy class.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.235
You know, she might be headed our way
if she passes the test.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.782
Dawson's the best.
You'd be lucky to get her.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.408
Oh, yeah, you think?

06:49.534 --> 06:52.536
Even after what you went through
with Jones's daughter?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.788
What does that mean?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.248
Oh, nothing, there just
tends to be a lot of drama, that's all.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.542
Traffic accident,
North Damen and Widmark.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.378
Hey, Loo! We're back in.
Accident on Damen.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.590
Hey, let's grab a beer soon, alright?

07:07.344 --> 07:11.514
That guy's a scourge on the CFD.
That whole house is.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.276
Yard sale this Saturday.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.613
- Deals aplenty.
- Cool. I'll take a look.

07:28.782 --> 07:33.160
- Whoa. Are those all incident reports?
- Nah, it's for my other gig.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.621
- What do you do?
- I work for my cousin,

07:35.747 --> 07:37.581
doing skip tracing.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.416
Uh, finding people.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.752
Process serving and
judgment recovery mostly,

07:41.878 --> 07:44.630
- but sometimes it gets jazzy.
- Yeah? Jazzy, huh?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.093
This is that tea
I was telling you about.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.178
Has a nice kick of ginger.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.930
Ooh. Oh, yeah.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.642
Like it already. Thank you, Connie.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.602
My pleasure.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.402
You know Connie?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.280
Yeah. Well, I met her this morning.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.490
What?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.287
I've never seen that woman
smile in my life.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.211
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.089
Hey, uh, when are you going to propose?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.842
Because I've almost let the cat
out of the bag, like once already.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.760
- Shh!
- I'm terrible with secrets.

08:31.887 --> 08:36.765
Well, you might've mentioned that before
I made you my wing man. Wing woman.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.101
- Whatever.
- It's too late now.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.644
Come here.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.857
I was thinking about doing it
two weeks from Saturday,

08:44.983 --> 08:47.610
and I was thinking about
one of those river cruises.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.528
It could be the perfect set up.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.906
She's so distracted
with the firefighter test...

08:52.032 --> 08:54.033
River cruise?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.285
What is wrong with a river cruise?

08:58.663 --> 09:02.166
Nothing. Much. Just... Anyhow, did you
get a chance to talk to her father?

09:02.292 --> 09:06.295
No. Her parents are in the Dominican
Republic for the next few months.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.963
Her family is important to her.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.882
I can't ask for their blessing
on a phone call.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.509
What are you going to do,
because you got to figure out...

09:12.636 --> 09:14.261
Shay. Remain calm.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.931
But you are never going to believe
who is outside asking for you.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.068
Leslie...

09:29.194 --> 09:31.654
Stay right there.
I'm calling the police.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.580
You want me to talk to Devon?
I have plenty to say.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.123
No, I got it.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.219
I don't blame you for being furious.
And if you called the cops, I get it...

09:55.345 --> 09:58.264
You're going to pay me and my roommates
back every dime you stole.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.308
I can get you back some of the stuff.
And I'll pay what I can.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.602
There's no excuse for what I did, Les.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.854
You need to return what you stole,
Devon.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.777
Can we meet up later and talk?

10:11.903 --> 10:13.529
When you have something to return.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.948
- OK. That's fair.
- You're not gonna call the cops?

10:16.074 --> 10:19.118
Look, if she goes to jail
we'll never get anything back.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.044
For the father,
bonding can begin right at birth.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.840
Hey, Chief...

10:32.966 --> 10:36.760
Ohhhhhh... Ohhhhhh...

10:36.886 --> 10:39.054
Ohhhhhh... Ohhhhhh...

10:39.180 --> 10:41.473
- I...
- What do you want, Mills?

10:41.599 --> 10:46.228
Uh, I just wanted to hand over
Squad time sheets.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.480
And, uh, sorry to interrupt.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.528
- Want me to close the blinds?
- It's not like that, Mills.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.656
OK. Sure. Uh-huh.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.825
Hmm.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.960
There you are.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.212
- Ah.
- Hey.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.136
Um...

11:21.348 --> 11:22.514
Um.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.269
Is there any chance
you might want to lie still

11:27.395 --> 11:29.730
and let me drag you across
the apparatus floor?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.733
I think you're, like,
just about dummy weight.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.026
No, I'd rather not.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.862
Wouldn't be good for my
"Tough Lieutenant" rep.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.531
Is that your rep?
I thought it was "Hot Lieutenant."

11:39.657 --> 11:40.824
Hey!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.993
- I'm not playing dummy.
- Darn it.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.372
Listen, um, I ran into
Tommy Welch, from Austin,

11:46.498 --> 11:48.457
after you guys left
the wood chipper run.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.876
- Uh, who's that?
- Truck Lieutenant.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.087
I guess Austin is
looking for a candidate.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.297
Oh, yeah? What's Welch like?

11:55.423 --> 11:58.175
He's a little... tough.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.552
Hmm. Baby, I can handle tough.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.554
Of course you can. The thing is,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.224
Austin got their first female
firefighter last year,

12:05.350 --> 12:07.476
and she barely lasted two weeks.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.062
Filed some grievance
against the guys in the house.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.857
We both know that there can be
two sides to that story.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.069
True enough.

12:17.195 --> 12:20.239
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

12:20.365 --> 12:23.033
boat accident, Michigan Avenue Bridge
and Riverwalk.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.829
- I hear diving is your specialty.
- You check it out and let me know.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.915
Battalion 25 to Main.
Going to need additional ambo units

12:30.041 --> 12:31.583
dispatched to the Riverwalk Pier.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.962
I was guiding her in. All of a sudden
the captain just accelerated.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.255
Took half the dock!

12:36.381 --> 12:38.048
Hey! You alright?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.592
Hurry! We don't know
how much longer we can hold him!

12:40.718 --> 12:42.094
Are there any more in the water?

12:42.220 --> 12:45.222
Just Dennis, but his leg is stuck,
we can't pull him up.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.932
Otis, charge a four inch line.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.518
Cruz, let's get the aerial
across to the boat.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.770
Herrmann and Mouch,
get aboard and help the victims.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.107
Guys, it's twenty-five feet deep here.
Let's get a ladder secured to the wall

12:55.233 --> 12:57.443
and have tools ready to
bring down to us, alright?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.111
Let's go!

13:24.846 --> 13:26.972
His leg must be caught on something.

13:27.098 --> 13:30.058
- We tried to pull him up, but we can't.
- We got him now.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.144
OK, guys, we're going
to bring you in, OK?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.859
Paramedic's on her way.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.402
Broken leg!

13:40.528 --> 13:43.530
- You see the captain around?
- Maybe he abandoned ship.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.158
Captain's always the last one off.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
Hey, I'm going to go down
and have a look.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.879
I don't see anybody.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.548
There!

14:05.428 --> 14:07.429
Fire department. Open up!

14:07.555 --> 14:10.182
Hey! Fire Department,
can you hear us?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.979
Whoa!

14:17.148 --> 14:19.900
Taking a little mid-day booze cruise,
are ya?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.068
Let's go, pal.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.491
I see the problem.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.661
His leg is wedged between
the bracing and the pilings.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.372
We're gonna need an extra
set of hands and a Halligan.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.085
Mills!

14:41.464 --> 14:43.966
We need you to hang onto Dennis
while we go back under, alright?

14:44.092 --> 14:45.425
Yeah. Copy that.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.223
He's showing signs of hypothermia.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.350
- You got five minutes.
- Got it.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.615
Alright! Pull him up.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.950
Give me a hand, Tony.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.702
Pull him up!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.496
We're good.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.046
Me thinks the jolly captain here
needs a breathalyzer test.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.507
- The hell I do!
- Casey.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.051
How fast can you tie
a handcuff knot?

15:28.177 --> 15:32.097
- About two and a half seconds, Chief.
- Do it.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.982
- You guys ever find the captain?
- You do the honors.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.358
He's all yours.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.278
Get up.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.573
See you.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.041
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.251
Nice job getting that guy
out of the water.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.919
You and Newhouse
worked well together.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.504
Yeah.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.799
What are you going to do about Devon?

16:09.427 --> 16:13.013
I told you.
I'm going to get our stuff back.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.313
Trust me, I'm not carrying a torch
for this girl, alright?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.815
If she doesn't get our stuff back soon,
I'm gonna call the cops.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.151
Just don't let her use this
to get close to you again.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.153
I won't.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.618
I got to go. I told Dawson
I'd run a quick errand with her.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.505
- Hey, thanks for doing this.
- Yeah. You know I love a good detour.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.467
Hey, guys. Hi.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.178
Hey, uh, we're from 51.
I'm Dawson... Shay.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.223
How's it going?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.433
You ladies need something?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.186
Um, we were just on our way
back from an errand,

17:01.312 --> 17:02.896
and I wanted to introduce myself,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.691
because I'm about to take
the firefighter test,

17:05.817 --> 17:09.111
and I guess Lieutenant Welch

17:09.237 --> 17:12.322
heard I might land at the house
if I pass, which would be cool.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.828
Deal me out of this hand.
I'll go get the Lieutenant.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.288
OK. Only if he's not busy...

17:32.260 --> 17:34.803
So which one of you is Dawson?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.556
That'd be me.
Nice to meet you, Lieutenant.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.643
Friendly place you got here, Lieutenant.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.104
You know, as you probably heard,

17:44.230 --> 17:47.232
our past experience with a female
firefighter wasn't real positive.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.819
So I'm sure you can understand
if we're not thrilled about

17:50.945 --> 17:54.239
the Chief forcing another one
down our throat.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.285
Didn't realize it was against your will.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.959
Oops, thanks for the warm welcome, guys,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.754
but it's time for us
to go start our periods.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.225
If I'm lucky enough to pass the test,
and I do end up here at Austin,

18:22.351 --> 18:24.811
I hope I'll change your mind.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.985
Anybody got any big plans
over the next forty-eight?

18:32.111 --> 18:35.489
Ah, Cindy just called and said
Lee Henry came home with head lice.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.324
So there's that.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.244
You guys hear Newhouse
is a skip tracer on his off hours?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.330
Sounds kind of like
a private investigator.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.373
- He does some real jazzy stuff.
- Yeah?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.668
Why is everybody falling all over
themselves with this guy?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.797
Whatever happened to proving yourself?

18:53.216 --> 18:55.509
You're jealous!

18:55.635 --> 18:58.345
It's new-kid-in-town syndrome.
Even Connie is walking around

18:58.471 --> 19:01.431
mooning over this guy,
and you, sir, are jealous.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.266
Get out of here.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.519
You're going on a date with her?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.646
Give me a break!
She's not good for you!

19:07.772 --> 19:09.147
Why can't you see that?

19:10.942 --> 19:12.859
You have to know Devon's playing you.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.861
She said she had some of our stuff
to return.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.823
I told her I'd meet her for a drink
at Molly's. What's wrong with that?

19:17.949 --> 19:20.367
You're meeting up with Devon?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.285
Devon the hoodlum, Devon?

19:22.411 --> 19:26.122
Yes. She showed up,
she says she wants to make things right.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.458
- I'm just trying to...
- Does she still have my helmet?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.586
Because that is the only way
things will ever be right again.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.464
Look, I am doing my best.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.093
I am trying to get back
what she stole from all of us, OK?

19:38.219 --> 19:42.848
So can you just give me a little credit,
that I'm not a complete dupe?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.021
How did that just get
turned around on us?

19:51.816 --> 19:56.111
- Check your phone again.
- I did two seconds ago. No message.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.031
I gave a hoodlum a second shot.
I'm an idiot, and I know it.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.994
- Feel free to tell me anyhow, though.
- Hey, not gonna happen, lady.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.372
My favorite part about you is that
under your crusty, bitter exterior

20:07.498 --> 20:09.082
lies an eternal optimist.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.626
You give all us fools second chances
when we screw up,

20:11.752 --> 20:13.712
and that is why we love you.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.631
Seriously, what am I gonna do
without you?

20:16.757 --> 20:19.009
You'll be fine. I promise.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.262
You cannot work at Austin.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.891
- What if I don't have a choice?
- No, there's got to be another place.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.103
Hey, we've been working
with guys since we started at the CFD.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.981
Yeah, we had to prove
ourselves every day,

20:33.107 --> 20:36.026
and let plenty of stuff roll off
our backs, but I can handle that.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.778
This place is different. I know
you felt it, too. It's stone age.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.781
Shay.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.036
You just say the word
and I will kick her ass.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.580
Looks like somebody else already did.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.625
My truck broke down
for the umpteenth time,

20:51.751 --> 20:55.003
and then they towed it off
with my cell phone inside.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.722
- You brought it back.
- Guys I gave it to couldn't sell it.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.809
Turns out it's a knock-off,
only worth a few bucks.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.276
It's not much, but it's a start.

21:22.698 --> 21:27.035
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I
want you to know why I did what I did.

21:31.874 --> 21:36.419
I got a call my dad was in jail
in San Antonio, and I panicked.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.047
Maybe the guy drinks too much,
but he's a decent man

21:39.173 --> 21:42.592
and he saved my ass more times
than I can count when I was a kid.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636
I knew I needed to get him out,

21:44.762 --> 21:48.098
so I did the stupidest thing
I have ever done.

21:48.683 --> 21:52.477
I took that stuff from you and your
roommates, and put together bail.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.986
You're my witness.
I'm swearing right here, right now,

22:01.112 --> 22:04.739
I will get every bit of the money I owe
back to Leslie and her roommates.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.908
If I'm your witness,
you better make good.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.661
I will.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.163
I promise.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.545
I had so much fun.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.423
- Hey, Wallace.
- Hey.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.758
Hey. Is everything OK?

22:23.884 --> 22:27.512
I was just wondering if you had
a minute to talk, but I can...

22:27.638 --> 22:29.764
- I can see that you're busy, so...
- No.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.099
- It can wait.
- Really.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.061
Hey, you guys?
I'll meet you at Terry's, OK?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.355
See you there.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.693
So what's on your mind?

22:42.695 --> 22:45.697
I just wanted to say,

22:45.823 --> 22:48.199
of course I've been thinking a lot...

22:49.452 --> 22:52.037
...about all of this, and, uh...

22:56.125 --> 22:57.876
Yeah.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.548
I believe the best thing...

23:05.176 --> 23:08.970
I believe the best thing for this baby
would be if you and I got married.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.433
If you and I were husband and wife,
I could support you

23:13.559 --> 23:18.271
and the child, both of you, financially
without any additional...

23:19.648 --> 23:21.274
...documentation.

23:22.985 --> 23:27.781
I also believe it would be a much more
stable environment for the child, so...

23:31.285 --> 23:32.702
Uh...

23:34.205 --> 23:36.748
Was that a proposal?

23:38.292 --> 23:40.919
Yes. Yes, it is.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.590
Then, uh, my answer is no.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.968
No way.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.577
Hey, morning, Chief.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.912
Hey, what's up?

24:16.038 --> 24:18.414
Uh, I don't want to bug you,
but you said you'd check on

24:18.541 --> 24:21.918
bringing relief in early tomorrow, since
the firefighter's test is tomorrow.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.671
I'm sorry, I meant to let you know.
Connie's already lined it up.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.466
- You are good to go.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.470
Hey, any chance you know
Laura Chiapetta, over at 77?

24:32.596 --> 24:35.306
Cos I heard she was on Truck there
and dated the Lieutenant,

24:35.432 --> 24:38.101
kind of under the radar.
I was thinking maybe...

24:38.227 --> 24:39.727
Yes, I know Laura.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.230
She and Lieutenant Kent
started fighting during calls,

24:42.356 --> 24:45.608
the relationship went south
and he got kicked to another house.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.487
You know who took the heat,
for all of it?

24:50.865 --> 24:52.699
The chief who let it happen.

24:54.368 --> 24:58.288
You become a firefighter, Dawson,
you cannot stay at 51.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.251
- I thought it was worth one more shot.
- Hmm.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.670
I wish Laura had told me
the end of that story.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.672
Dawson?

25:08.257 --> 25:10.925
Are you ready for your test?

25:11.719 --> 25:13.803
Yes, sir. I believe I am.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.722
Good.

25:17.641 --> 25:21.394
That boat accident kind of turned me off
to the whole proposal-on-a-cruise idea.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.355
Really? Didn't realize
you were the one proposing.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.149
Hey, Smokey.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.402
It's just that I have to hear about it
all the time, so I got skin in the game.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.071
What about a hot air balloon ride
over the lake?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.489
I don't know.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.868
Alright, never mind
on the hot air balloon idea.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.495
I got a lot more
where that came from.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.707
Hey, did you figure out
what to do with Dawson's dad?

25:42.833 --> 25:45.293
Yeah, I did.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.964
Hey! Thanks for coming by, Antonio.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.092
- You didn't have to rush over here.
- Yeah, I did.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.636
When you said this was on the sly,

25:54.762 --> 25:56.638
I figured out right away
what you're up to.

25:56.764 --> 25:57.764
You did?

25:57.890 --> 26:01.768
We're talking surprise party, right?
If Gabby passes the test?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.646
Uh, that's a great idea,

26:04.772 --> 26:08.149
but no, actually.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.734
Um...

26:11.445 --> 26:14.030
I know your parents
are out of town, so, uh,

26:14.156 --> 26:16.908
I'm coming to you
because I think your sister

26:17.034 --> 26:19.327
is the most amazing woman
I've ever met.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.997
And I'd like to ask for
her hand in marriage, but,

26:23.123 --> 26:25.875
uh, I wanted to get your blessing first.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.382
Seriously, bro?

26:33.342 --> 26:36.302
You couldn't do this the right way
and wait for my father to get back?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.514
Cos I can tell you now,
in my culture, if someone...

26:42.685 --> 26:45.853
I'm messing with you, man!
Of course you got my blessing!

26:45.980 --> 26:48.773
Damn, Antonio!

26:48.899 --> 26:51.359
Hey, you know me, I hit them
when they're on the ropes!

26:51.485 --> 26:52.902
I'm gonna get you back.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.613
No holds barred when we're family.
That's how the Dawsons play.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.574
- Yeah, I've noticed.
- Look at this.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.119
I'm thrilled for the both of you, man.

27:02.121 --> 27:05.707
So he kissed his wife goodbye, heads off
to work and vanishes, alright?

27:05.833 --> 27:07.333
Police have no leads.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.753
But the wife tells us that he likes
old cars, specifically Mustangs.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.922
So me and my cousin
start looking through classifieds

27:13.048 --> 27:16.134
in neighboring states, and sure enough,
that's how we found him...

27:16.260 --> 27:20.388
Buying a stripped down, candy-apple red
1967 Shelby in Iowa City.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.475
The guy had moved there,
changed his last name

27:24.601 --> 27:27.103
- and even married another woman.
- You're kidding.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.355
Oh, great move, though,
getting him with the car.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.441
Seems pretty common sense to me.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.743
You, uh, need help
finding something?

27:41.869 --> 27:45.747
Nah, man, just scoping out
the snack situation.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.458
Well, let me know if you have questions
about anything here at 51.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.127
- Happy to help.
- Cool, will do.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.297
Where you from, Mills?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.966
Mount Greenwood.
Dad was on Squad out there.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.386
- Nice neighborhood.
- Yeah.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.514
My mom is from Humboldt Park,
so I spent a lot of time there, too.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.516
- Right.
- How about you?

28:05.642 --> 28:06.893
I grew up in Roseland.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.146
Wow. That is a tough part of town.
You go back there often, or...

28:10.272 --> 28:14.025
All the time. I mean, people hear that
name, they react like it's a war zone,

28:14.151 --> 28:17.403
but it's a neighborhood,
filled with good people.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.490
Your second job...

28:21.450 --> 28:23.534
How much you need to know
about someone to find them?

28:23.660 --> 28:25.078
Why? You got a case for us?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.748
No, just, uh, sounds like
interesting work.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.798
Got something for you.

28:39.134 --> 28:42.178
Oh, my gods.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.846
Your Viper helmet!

28:43.972 --> 28:45.306
How did she get it back?

28:45.432 --> 28:49.560
I can't believe any collector would
just buy this and then let it go.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.771
She found a way.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.065
Thank you.

28:57.361 --> 29:02.281
Hey, five hundred bucks from Devon,
just a down payment on what she owes.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.284
Did she put this money together,

29:05.411 --> 29:08.246
or did you take it out of your savings
to cover for her?

29:08.372 --> 29:10.665
She was helping out her dad, OK? She...

29:10.791 --> 29:13.126
She feels really bad.
She's gonna get us back the money.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.503
You think this is about the money?
It's not about that.

29:15.629 --> 29:19.298
It's about her being a liar
and stepping on you.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.468
Again.

29:28.058 --> 29:31.102
T-minus twelve hours
to the big test, huh?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.396
Eleven and a half.
But who's counting?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.481
I felt fine until like, an hour ago.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.150
You're gonna be great.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.069
Hey, thanks for being so supportive
through this whole thing.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.739
Hey, Mills, fancy joining me
out back for a cigar?

29:43.866 --> 29:45.324
Sure.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.997
Congratulations, Chief.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.958
Becoming a dad.

29:55.169 --> 29:58.337
I don't understand her reaction
to my proposal.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.341
I mean, I may have sent the relationship
way off track...

30:04.094 --> 30:07.346
...but I care for this woman.
- Did you tell her that?

30:08.015 --> 30:11.142
Of course. In so many words.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.396
That's why I don't do relationships.

30:15.522 --> 30:19.817
I tell her I want to provide support and
stability for the child under the law,

30:19.943 --> 30:22.945
and she... She gets mad?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.907
It doesn't make no damn sense.

30:28.368 --> 30:31.204
- What?
- Can I be honest?

30:31.330 --> 30:32.872
Yeah.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.626
The way that you just said it right now

30:36.752 --> 30:39.378
made it sound like
a whole bunch of legal talk.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.922
About the kid.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.092
If you really care about this woman
the way that you say,

30:45.219 --> 30:47.178
then you're gonna have
to put yourself out there.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.262
What does that mean?

30:48.388 --> 30:51.516
That means dropping all this formal
stuff and telling her like it is.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.476
What if she pushes me away?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.898
Or I make myself look like an ass.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.984
That could definitely happen.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.447
Yeah.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.121
Hey, need a hand?

31:14.248 --> 31:17.124
Nah. This isn't actually work-related,

31:17.251 --> 31:21.170
it's a lawn ornament I'm hoping
to unload at the yard sale.

31:21.296 --> 31:25.383
Any interest in a Tachi-gata
style stone lantern?

31:25.509 --> 31:27.176
Has a built-in rain gauge.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.846
I got kid junk all over my lawn.
I got no room.

31:33.433 --> 31:38.104
You know how I signed up for
a bunch of singles web sites

31:38.230 --> 31:41.357
- and went on all those dates?
- Oh, yeah. How's that going?

31:41.525 --> 31:43.150
Not good.

31:43.277 --> 31:46.195
Nothing worked out and the whole thing
just got me more depressed.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.114
Then I had this epiphany.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.450
I never really let go of Mari.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.829
I'm holding onto all these things
that remind me of her,

31:54.955 --> 31:57.123
no wonder I can't move on.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.292
Look, Herrmann,

31:59.418 --> 32:04.547
I know the last few new additions to 51
have led to some pretty rough seas.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.049
But Newhouse seems like a good guy.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.427
And maybe...

32:11.722 --> 32:14.974
- I should have a yard sale.
- Yeah.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.644
That's what I was thinking.

32:20.564 --> 32:24.275
Ambulance 61, woman in distress,
1916 Pearl Street.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.703
Dispatch, we have an apartment number?

32:35.829 --> 32:37.288
Negative, 61.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.832
Up here! Please!

32:39.958 --> 32:41.208
Where are you, ma'am?

32:41.335 --> 32:42.918
Fifth floor.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.392
My name's Gabriela, this is Leslie.
What's your name, hon?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.186
Grace. Grace Seitzman.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.604
What's going on, Grace?

33:01.730 --> 33:04.023
It started to hurt really bad,
near my stomach,

33:04.149 --> 33:05.524
but it can't be contractions yet.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.485
- How pregnant are you?
- Only eight months.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.362
It's too soon for the baby to come.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.406
- Is this your first pregnancy?
- Yes. Ooh!

33:12.532 --> 33:14.909
OK, breathe through this for me, Grace.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.702
Can we get her down the stairs
on the chair?

33:16.828 --> 33:20.122
No, the stairs are too steep.
Do you think you can walk?

33:20.874 --> 33:24.293
- No, I don't think I can.
- Grace, you're gonna have to try.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.174
OK.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.684
Oh, my God! Why does it hurt like this?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.687
Hang in there. Strong contractions
don't mean anything's wrong,

33:42.813 --> 33:45.481
- they just hurt like hell.
- Here we go.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.651
But it's too soon for the baby to come.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.903
Oh! Oh!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.363
They're coming pretty quick.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.990
I need to take a look to see if the baby
is getting close, OK, Grace?

33:55.117 --> 33:56.784
Oh!

33:56.910 --> 33:58.577
We need you to sit down
and relax for us.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.579
Oh, the baby is not coming!

34:02.582 --> 34:04.125
The baby is coming, Grace!

34:07.003 --> 34:09.130
I need a blanket,
clamp and suction bulb.

34:09.256 --> 34:10.631
On it.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.971
Mouch, Cindy's birthday
is coming up.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.849
Anything at that yard sale, you know,
that she might go for?

34:19.975 --> 34:24.311
Got a nice donabe and a practically
new bottle of Tsubaki Tsubaki,

34:24.438 --> 34:26.731
that stuff's pretty hard to come by.

34:26.857 --> 34:28.274
What is it?

34:28.400 --> 34:31.902
I believe it's a hair oil
of some kind.

34:32.028 --> 34:35.322
So you're going to buy your wife
a birthday gift at Mouch's yard sale?

34:35.449 --> 34:37.116
Any chance it kills lice?

34:38.243 --> 34:40.244
What's up, Newhouse?

34:43.874 --> 34:46.751
Hey, uh, Newhouse,
you might not know this

34:46.877 --> 34:49.503
but me and some of the guys here,
we, uh,

34:49.629 --> 34:53.841
we own the best bar in Chicago, so
maybe you could come by after shift.

34:53.967 --> 34:58.512
First round... 15 percent off.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.850
Cool. I'll be there.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.937
Ambo's still out at that call?

35:07.063 --> 35:10.566
If Dawson is gonna report for this test,
she needs to be en route in an hour.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.410
I can see the baby,
but it's not coming.

35:21.536 --> 35:25.247
Let's try and get her down these stairs.
Maybe we can get her to hospital.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.923
I can feel it! I can feel it!
You were right, the baby's coming now!

35:34.049 --> 35:36.675
OK, let's do this here.
Grace, we'll lie you down.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.016
- Dawson, you got to get going.
- I'm not going anywhere.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.355
I can feel his head!
Oh, he's coming out!

35:49.481 --> 35:51.732
You're right, Grace.
The baby's crowning.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.944
Dispatch, let Chicago Med know
we are going to deliver on site

35:55.070 --> 35:57.446
and then transport.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.448
Second watch will be here
in about 20 minutes.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.785
There's no rig. By the time
they're suited up and ready to go,

36:02.911 --> 36:04.537
Dawson could be
en route to the hospital.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.581
She'll never leave a victim's side
without back-up.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.422
OK, Grace, give it another go.
Keep pushing!

36:19.177 --> 36:22.054
- What is happening?
- I can see the baby's head.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.223
- Oh!
- It's shoulder dystocia.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.476
OK, Grace, the shoulder is a little
stuck, right above the pelvic bone.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.603
What does that mean?
Is the baby going to be OK?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.064
The baby will be fine if you just
keep breathing and stay calm.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.150
- Dawson, can we do McRoberts?
- Yeah. Let's try it.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.777
OK. Grace, grab your leg.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.864
We've got to get your knees
as far back as far as possible, OK?

36:39.990 --> 36:43.033
This is going to widen your pelvis
and help the baby come out. OK?

36:43.159 --> 36:47.496
OK. On three. Here we go.
One, two, three.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.417
Push! Push, push!
Push! Push! Push! Push!

36:52.294 --> 36:55.087
OK, one more time!
One more time, Grace!

36:55.213 --> 36:57.882
Again, one, two, three! Push! Push!

36:58.008 --> 37:02.177
Push! Push! Push! Push! Push! Push!

37:07.100 --> 37:09.435
We got him!

37:09.561 --> 37:11.103
Her! It's a her!

37:19.654 --> 37:22.031
Congratulations, mama.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.199
Yeah, I know, I'm gonna miss the test.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.701
Yeah.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.958
Hey. Go. Look, I'm a certified EMT.
I can take over for you.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.586
- Casey is waiting downstairs.
- That doesn't feel right.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.630
Go. I'll be alright without you.
I promise.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.883
Go.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.469
Come on.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.805
Kick butt.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.893
Come on, let's go! Alright!

37:56.483 --> 37:59.193
Alright! Hit it, Joe!

38:07.202 --> 38:10.788
- How you feeling? You ready?
- Uh-huh.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.706
Get your coat on!

38:17.170 --> 38:22.049
Please stay in two straight lines
until you guys get into the yard, OK?

38:22.175 --> 38:25.469
Come on. Let's go.
Two straight lines, please.

38:26.346 --> 38:29.723
Thank you. Looking good, thank you.
Thank you very much.

38:31.601 --> 38:32.685
Wallace...

38:34.980 --> 38:36.522
Hi.

38:39.192 --> 38:42.778
I know I've made some mistakes
in the past. Pretty big ones.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.115
And I let them get in the way...

38:46.241 --> 38:48.492
...and stop me from just
being honest with you.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.496
But the truth is...

38:53.999 --> 38:56.000
...I believe that when you...

38:56.835 --> 38:58.544
...love somebody,

38:58.670 --> 39:01.338
there's only one thing to do.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.092
So, my aunt, uh,

39:05.218 --> 39:07.636
she's had this family ring for years.
When I called her today,

39:07.762 --> 39:10.347
she didn't even let me finish.
She just said,

39:10.473 --> 39:14.601
"I can hear it in your voice.
You're finally ready."

39:17.147 --> 39:18.522
So...

39:21.651 --> 39:22.943
Miss Donna Robbins...

39:26.364 --> 39:28.532
Will you...

39:28.658 --> 39:29.908
...marry me?

39:38.793 --> 39:40.961
Well, I don't have much choice.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.380
I can't crush the hearts
of my entire class, right?

39:46.009 --> 39:47.301
Yes, I will.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.769
Oh, Donna.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.573
Go get 'em!

40:18.208 --> 40:20.459
Get up here, Candidate.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.503
Get up here.

40:24.047 --> 40:25.881
Hurry!

40:28.218 --> 40:30.219
Sorry I'm late.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.516
You better be ready.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.186
Go.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.870
Hustle, honey! Hustle, hustle!
