00:17.308 --> 00:20.395
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.689
We know you don't believe us.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.942
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.239
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.953
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.580
-A scary tale.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.331
-A strange tale.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.625
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.963
-You really think you can handle it?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.934
Once upon a--

01:00.018 --> 01:04.022
Once upon a time that little girl
we've been talking about for some reason

01:04.105 --> 01:07.358
was walking with nine fingers.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.612
-Gretel!

01:11.196 --> 01:12.072
Oh!

01:12.155 --> 01:14.657
But then she found a bowl
of brand-new fingers.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.702
-She picked the biggest finger

01:17.786 --> 01:20.330
so she could point farther than anyone,

01:20.413 --> 01:21.956
and she pointed all the way

01:22.040 --> 01:24.459
-to cloud land!

01:24.542 --> 01:27.253
Zoom!

01:27.337 --> 01:29.255
-What are you doing?

01:29.339 --> 01:34.094
I'm telling the story now!
And I'm so good at it!

01:34.928 --> 01:38.223
Above the clouds,
nobody could hurt Gretel.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.184
-And she's very scared of hurty stuff.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.144
Is it weird I kinda like this story?

01:43.228 --> 01:46.397
Oh no! They forgot the bowl of fingers!

01:46.481 --> 01:49.317
Who's gonna eat all those free fingers?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.401
Enough!

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
I am telling this story.

01:53.238 --> 01:57.617
And may I remind you,
it must be told exactly as it happened,

01:57.700 --> 02:00.161
or we will suffer the consequences.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.371
What story?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.789
Silence!

02:04.165 --> 02:08.128
Once upon a time,
a brother and sister walked alone.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.175
-Whoa! Wow!

02:17.929 --> 02:22.433
This is amazing.
The nature here is all so… natural.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.938
This could be it,
the perfect place for a perfect home.

02:27.021 --> 02:30.233
-Where we can be our own perfect family.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.739
Oh…

02:36.823 --> 02:38.366
-Cool.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.910
-Wow.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.912
Oh my stars!

02:43.663 --> 02:46.958
What lovely small people.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.460
Oh my, that was ever so loud.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.713
I haven't spoken in simply ages.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.967
It'll be 63 years next Wednesday.

02:56.050 --> 02:56.968
Hello?

02:57.051 --> 02:58.469
Hello.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.639
Come around,
so I can get a good look at you.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.351
Ah…

03:05.435 --> 03:06.895
Not small people.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.693
Children! Did I hear you say
you're looking for a home?

03:13.776 --> 03:14.611
Yes!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.112
A perfect one.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.991
-Well, you've reached the wood of life,

03:20.074 --> 03:22.952
a place of perfect harmony.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.040
I am Mother Tree, protector of this place.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.168
May we stay here, weird talking tree?

03:30.251 --> 03:33.338
You may stay
as long as you please, my child.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.964
We'd like that very much.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.258
Well, then, welcome home,

03:37.842 --> 03:40.220
my little pine cones.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.096
Whoa!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.556
Thank you, tree!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.059
-Mwah!

03:46.142 --> 03:48.436
Ow! Splinters.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.064
The wood of life has but one rule,

03:51.147 --> 03:54.025
take only what you need and nothing more.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.446
If you stay,
you must maintain the harmony.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.031
Do you understand?

04:00.114 --> 04:02.742
-Yeah, we promise.
-Yes, and we promise.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.118
What are we promising?

04:04.619 --> 04:09.040
But of course in this story,
no one makes a rule

04:09.123 --> 04:12.627
unless someone is going to break it.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.010
-Wow.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.013
-Oh…

04:26.099 --> 04:27.517
It's beautiful.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.736
Whoa!

04:47.704 --> 04:49.205
I love your antlers!

04:51.499 --> 04:54.210
This is it, the perfect place.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.296
We'll make our new home
right in this spot.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.465
-Hansel, I can already see it.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.759
We're going to be so happy here.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.179
We have everything we need.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.181
And no awful parents to ruin it.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.653
I'll never let anything
hurt you again, Gretel.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.699
I'm gonna take care of you here
and make sure everything is perfect.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.950
My hero.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.330
And they lived happily ever after.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.372
The end.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.334
Are we done?
Can I go eat that bowl of fingers now?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.960
Jacob, this isn't the end.

05:36.044 --> 05:41.299
Well, can't we just pretend it ends here
before things get, you know, dark?

05:41.382 --> 05:43.843
-You know we can't.

05:43.926 --> 05:48.431
For it is within the darkest zones
that one finds the brightest beauty,

05:48.514 --> 05:50.516
and the most luminous wisdom.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.934
And the most blood!

05:52.018 --> 05:55.146
Blood is my favorite thing
in stories, and in people!

05:55.229 --> 05:58.274
Then you're going to be
the only one who likes this chapter.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
Yay! Terror!

06:09.786 --> 06:11.662
-Morning, sleepyhead.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.752
Mmm. Mmm.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.049
I started building our home without you.
Uh, hope you don't mind.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.259
Shouldn't you be resting?

06:25.343 --> 06:26.594
I feel great.

06:26.677 --> 06:30.014
There's a lot to build before this place
will start to feel like a home.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.185
Uh, can we build a toilet next?

06:34.268 --> 06:38.898
I'm working on a main hall right now.
Do you think we need a scrapbooking room?

06:38.981 --> 06:40.900
-I think we need food.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.652
Uh, right after my pit stop.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.697
Okay.
I'll just do this work all alone, then!

07:11.806 --> 07:14.142
-A little higher. Got it!

07:33.619 --> 07:34.745
My hero.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.251
Uh…

08:29.884 --> 08:33.513
This is really
starting to feel like home.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.723
Yeah, as long as you like berries.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.986
-One of us.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.989
Although Hansel was afraid,

08:52.073 --> 08:54.617
he was also drawn to this feeling.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.411
It was calling to him.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.958
Hansel? Hansel?

09:03.084 --> 09:04.252
Where is he?

09:07.004 --> 09:08.923
Well, um, Drago,

09:09.006 --> 09:11.717
I don't suppose you have any ideas

09:11.801 --> 09:14.637
to make this shack more of a real castle?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.098
You're right.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.183
We could use a tower.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.856
-One of us.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.622
Yeah, you better run!

09:56.387 --> 09:57.722
Welcome home, Hansel.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.265
How was your day?

09:59.348 --> 10:00.516
"Amazing."

10:00.600 --> 10:04.478
"What a great idea you had
to stay here and be our own parents."

10:04.562 --> 10:07.898
Thank you.
What do you think about the new wing?

10:07.982 --> 10:10.067
"I think it's elegant and inspired,

10:10.151 --> 10:12.361
but I agree with Drago
about the new tower."

10:12.945 --> 10:15.615
I don't recall telling you
about Drago's idea.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.868
Have you been spying on us?

10:22.747 --> 10:23.706
Hmm!

10:27.585 --> 10:29.629
-Whoa!

10:32.798 --> 10:34.258
What do you want, weird bird?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.307
One of us.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.944
-No, you're funny. What? Nothing!

10:54.028 --> 10:57.448
You were talking to pine cones!
Where have you been, anyway?

10:57.531 --> 10:59.659
Getting firewood,
and I forgot what I was doing.

10:59.742 --> 11:03.454
I ended up at the edge of the woods.
The shadows talked to me and I roared!

11:03.537 --> 11:07.416
Then they went away and I saw a bird,
so I followed it, I got close and then--

11:07.500 --> 11:09.377
It was crazy! I love it here!

11:09.460 --> 11:12.213
Oh. Um, I love it here, too.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.382
I'm just… I'm glad you're home.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.930
Hey, I was thinking a tower might make
this place feel more like a real home.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.058
-It would be so perfect.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.269
Why are you making a fire? It's not cold.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.981
To cook your dinner.
Am I a provider or what?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.149
What is that?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.776
-It's a meat.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.653
It's a bird.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.449
It was a bird. Now it's meat.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.620
You remember
what that talking tree said, right?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.081
Take only what you need and nothing more.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.917
I need to take care of you,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.796
and that means I need to provide food
that isn't just berries.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.174
-Also, hunting is freakin' awesome!
-What?!

11:59.510 --> 12:03.139
Well, some roast pheasant
does sound pretty good right now.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.099
But just this once, okay?

12:05.182 --> 12:06.684
I promise.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.687
-Hey, this pine cone looks like me!

12:13.107 --> 12:16.235
Just a few more ferns
and we should be done.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.863
Huh. We're all out. I'll go fetch more.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.116
Come right back home, okay?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.418
Hey there, little guy…

12:35.045 --> 12:36.380
No, not again!

12:37.006 --> 12:37.882
Go home.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.343
We do not need more meat.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.972
-One of us.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.109
Hansel?

12:58.694 --> 13:01.322
Hansel?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.917
-One for Hansel, one for Drago,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.126
and one for me.

13:14.668 --> 13:15.503
Mmm.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.880
Are you going to finish that?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.262
I see you.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.725
Hansel, you promised!

13:30.643 --> 13:33.145
I'm sorry, but we need food, right?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.439
I said I was gonna provide for you.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.942
We'll just eat it all
so nothing goes to waste.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.777
Then we're not breaking the rule.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.904
Okay. This is fine.

13:41.987 --> 13:46.242
Uh-oh. Whenever she says,
"This is fine," it never is.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.536
-Does she know what that word means?
-Ha!

13:48.619 --> 13:50.579
Wait. That actually made sense.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.622
Wait for it.

13:51.705 --> 13:55.209
Hey! Hey! Do you guys eat your fleas
or just pick them off?

13:55.292 --> 13:56.669
-There we go.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.506
-As time passed, Hansel continued to hunt.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.759
He knew he shouldn't.
He wished he didn't want to.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.470
-But he wanted to so much.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.726
Meanwhile, Gretel's desire
to build the perfect home and family

14:12.810 --> 14:15.521
-turned into an obsession.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.689
Sir Hanselot, what do you think
of young Anna Pinehoff's new dress?

14:59.273 --> 15:02.401
I think
she should stop sneaking around

15:02.484 --> 15:04.361
with that rakish Spanish count,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.989
Señor Humberto del Piño.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.157
Hush!

15:08.240 --> 15:13.245
My uncle, Baron Klaus von Tannenzapfen
must never know!

15:16.123 --> 15:18.375
Anna, what is this?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.753
What am I to tell your betrothed,

15:20.836 --> 15:23.464
le Roi des Drago Rouge?

15:23.547 --> 15:27.426
Tell him
the heart wants what the heart wants!

15:27.509 --> 15:29.887
Man, she's gone loony!

15:29.970 --> 15:32.181
Not loony, just lonely.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.557
How could Anna be lonely?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.184
She has two boyfriends,

15:35.267 --> 15:38.562
and Drago is clearly
the one who loves her!

15:38.646 --> 15:40.356
Humberto is just a jerk!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.816
My tongue!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.194
Ah…

15:45.277 --> 15:47.029
Hansel, your teeth!

15:47.112 --> 15:49.114
That doesn't seem weird to you?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.032
Not weird.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.951
Good.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.209
Mmm.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.548
-Mmm.

16:35.369 --> 16:39.123
Mother Tree, Mother Tree,
what's happening to my brother?

16:39.206 --> 16:41.875
He has upset the balance.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.920
The wood of life is no longer in harmony.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.423
Just tell me what to do. Please.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.092
He only stays here because of you.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.012
There is but one way to fix this.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.098
The deep dark woods
will take what's left of Hansel…

16:56.181 --> 16:59.893
-…if you reject him, turn from him,

16:59.977 --> 17:02.021
break his heart.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.939
I could never do that.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.608
He's my brother. What's wrong with you?

17:06.692 --> 17:09.611
Your brother is not
the only one out of balance.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.447
You are building a castle,

17:11.530 --> 17:15.159
a castle in which to hide
from your own loneliness.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.201
So what?

17:16.285 --> 17:19.038
It's just a bunch
of rocks and wood and stuff.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.582
You know I'm made of wood, right?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.167
-Listen to me.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.295
You must let Hansel go
and restore the balance

17:26.837 --> 17:28.422
before it is too late.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.300
No, all we have is each other.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.260
He's still my brother.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.553
Is he?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.724
The wood of life
is no longer safe with him here…

17:39.391 --> 17:41.060
and neither are you.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.686
Hansel would never hurt me.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.150
-But the thing he is becoming might.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.528
-Hansel!

17:53.989 --> 17:55.282
Hansel, wake up!

17:55.365 --> 17:58.243
Five more minutes.

17:58.827 --> 17:59.912
Ugh!

18:03.248 --> 18:05.375
Meat!

18:05.959 --> 18:09.755
This is not fine. I want my brother back!

18:10.339 --> 18:11.757
I'm still brother.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.175
You have to stop this.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.053
It isn't even hunting anymore.
It's just slaughtering.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.765
Must hunt, Gretel.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.391
Just stay home.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.434
We can play a game.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.478
-Or maybe plant a garden.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.230
Must hunt, Gretel.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.774
Hansel, please.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.484
I need you.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.453
Ahem.

18:41.537 --> 18:46.375
I am looking
for a young prince and princess.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.584
May I enter the wood?

18:47.668 --> 18:50.921
There is no royalty in the wood of life.

18:51.004 --> 18:56.218
Every creature coexists here
in perfect harmony and peace.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.220
It's a pretty good setup, if you ask me.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.763
That's cute.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.225
Well, what about the creatures
that eat other creatures?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.436
You know what? No one likes a smart aleck.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.064
Just for that, I'm not letting you in.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.193
-You think you can stop me? You're a tree.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.319
Hmm.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.704
Point taken.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.334
Mm-hmm.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.220
Hmm?

19:45.976 --> 19:49.521
The flower moat was a great idea,
wasn't it, Hansel?

19:52.816 --> 19:56.486
Okay, fine,
but you don't have to be a jerk about it.

20:07.122 --> 20:11.376
Can you please skip this?
I mean, it's gonna be so nasty!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.253
Nobody wants to see intestines.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.465
Uh, I do! Give me the guts, baby!

20:16.548 --> 20:18.842
Tasteful silhouettes, please.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.887
Ooh!

20:46.328 --> 20:47.663
It's you, isn't it?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.750
-What have you done?
-Must hunt, Gretel!

20:51.833 --> 20:54.002
-You may be Hansel,

20:54.670 --> 20:56.672
but you're not my brother anymore.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.757
You're not!

20:58.840 --> 21:02.052
You're a monster,
and I won't have monsters in my home!

21:02.135 --> 21:04.137
Get out! Do you hear me?

21:04.221 --> 21:06.348
I don't want you here! Go!

21:07.683 --> 21:10.519
-I don't need you!

21:15.899 --> 21:18.443
Whoa! That sounded nearby.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.571
Let us stay close so I can protect you.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.741
-Let the great hunt commence.

21:26.535 --> 21:30.038
-Must hunt Gretel! Must hunt Gretel!

21:39.881 --> 21:42.301
It's quieter than usual.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.469
Do you smell that?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.264
It wasn't me.

21:47.347 --> 21:51.852
No, my lord.
The wood of life smells like death.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.481
Wait. Now I smell it. Death.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.391
What the devil was that?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.518
-A beast, my lord!

22:33.602 --> 22:35.228
Mmm.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.816
Keep your eyes peeled.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.444
Peeled eyes?!
Now it's getting good!

22:50.911 --> 22:53.163
-This is fine. Perfect.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.499
Just do it already. Do it!

23:03.465 --> 23:04.633
Do…

23:04.716 --> 23:06.051
Do you remember this?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.011
This is Hansel.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.222
He used to take care of me.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.973
He was…

23:12.057 --> 23:13.433
He was my hero.

23:14.351 --> 23:18.063
You see,
Hansel was exactly 96% monster,

23:18.855 --> 23:23.485
but the other 4% was the love
of a brother for his sister.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.656
-Whoa.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.162
-Don't!

23:34.246 --> 23:35.831
-Hansel, no!

23:55.517 --> 23:57.686
Excellent shot, my lord.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.272
-Mmm. Indeed.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.695
This is the sad part!
This is the sad part!

24:06.778 --> 24:08.530
This is the sad part!

24:08.613 --> 24:10.532
All stories have a sad part.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.159
They must if they're true.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.785
This story has so many.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.537
Look, I know it hurts.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.123
It hurts when a character you love dies

24:18.206 --> 24:21.710
and another one is left all alone
in a dark and grim tale.

24:21.793 --> 24:25.714
All we can tell you
is that it will get better. It will.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.382
Just not yet.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.469
How can it?
He sacrificed his life for her.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.805
Now Anna Pinehoff
truly knows how much Drago loved her,

24:33.889 --> 24:37.517
but it's too late! Too late!

24:38.018 --> 24:39.936
-What story have you been watching?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.647
Uh, the good one, with the pine cones?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.733
-Once upon a time,

24:44.816 --> 24:47.235
a very sad and lonely girl
had to figure out

24:47.319 --> 24:49.696
how to go on without her brother.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.671
But go on she did.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.261
-Mother Tree?
-Mmm.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.096
Hmm.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.227
You were right. I'm sorry.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.314
My brother… is dead.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.985
He'd still be alive
if I had listened to you and let him go.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.279
What…

25:31.780 --> 25:33.114
What should I do now?

25:34.449 --> 25:35.992
-Hmm.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.848
And so,
banished from the wood of life,

25:58.932 --> 26:00.517
Gretel was forced to return

26:00.600 --> 26:03.353
-to the deep dark woods.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.735
And she was not alone.
