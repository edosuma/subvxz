00:42.153 --> 00:47.147
So many yesterdays

00:48.960 --> 00:54.159
Haunting my soul today

00:55.500 --> 01:00.096
Now time is standing still

01:01.473 --> 01:07.605
In the tears and rain

01:08.646 --> 01:13.845
I'll find another spring

01:15.487 --> 01:20.686
No doubt the birds will sing

01:21.726 --> 01:26.959
But I will never shine

01:27.031 --> 01:32.025
So very bright again

01:33.972 --> 01:36.338
Okay, stand by.
Tell Mary Beth we're coming up.

01:36.408 --> 01:39.104
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds, Mary Beth.

01:39.177 --> 01:41.407
Jack, I need a minute.
Take a commercial.

01:41.479 --> 01:43.572
Can't. We're at six seconds.
Count it.

01:43.648 --> 01:46.640
Four, three, two, cue her.

01:46.718 --> 01:52.088
Less than 24 hours ago, I reported
to you from the shooting location...

01:52.157 --> 01:54.853
of a new movie being
filmed here in Oregon.

01:54.926 --> 01:58.487
It was a happy report because
it featured one of America's...

01:58.563 --> 02:02.659
most huggable heroes,
the cuddly canine superstar, Benji.

02:02.734 --> 02:05.601
Tonight Benji is missing at sea.

02:05.670 --> 02:09.834
He was with his trainer, Frank Inn,
in a small, open fishing boat...

02:09.908 --> 02:13.605
just off the coast
when the boat capsized.

02:13.678 --> 02:16.306
Mr. Inn was rescued.
He was taken here...

02:16.381 --> 02:18.315
to the Coast Guard station in Newport...

02:18.383 --> 02:21.045
where he apparently
is in good condition.

02:21.119 --> 02:23.212
But Benji is still missing.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.820
Mr. Inn, I know this is
a terrible time for you.

02:28.893 --> 02:32.659
- But can you tell us what happened
- I don"t know.

02:32.730 --> 02:37.167
It happened so fast.
One moment it was sunny and calm...

02:37.235 --> 02:39.396
and the next was...

02:39.471 --> 02:43.066
At what point did
you lose sight of Benji?

02:43.141 --> 02:47.578
I never saw Benji
after the boat turned over.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.579
We searched for him for a while.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.207
I wanted to stay longer,
but the captain said...

02:52.283 --> 02:55.514
that I had to get in
for medical attention.

02:55.587 --> 02:59.546
Benji likes to bark at the fish
when I catch 'em.

02:59.624 --> 03:03.390
They flop around the boat,
you know, and he barks.

03:03.461 --> 03:07.557
We had this big snapper.
He'd never seen a fish that big before.

03:07.632 --> 03:11.261
It was his first time
on the ocean.

03:11.336 --> 03:14.737
Is there any chance that Benji
could make it to shore on his own?

03:14.806 --> 03:19.004
It was so rough.
All of a sudden, it was so rough!

03:19.077 --> 03:23.104
He's a good swimmer,
but it was so rough.

03:24.649 --> 03:27.982
Thank you, Mr. Inn.
We'll all be hoping for the best.

03:29.454 --> 03:32.184
Benji's producer told us
a few moments ago...

03:32.257 --> 03:35.886
that he has definitely not given up hope
that the floppy-eared star...

03:35.960 --> 03:38.258
might have made it back
to shore on his own.

03:38.329 --> 03:40.627
He plans to begin a helicopter search...

03:40.698 --> 03:44.099
first thing in the morning,
weather permitting.

03:44.168 --> 03:46.932
In 1906,Joseph Conrad wrote...

03:47.005 --> 03:50.133
"The sea has no generosity.

03:50.208 --> 03:54.804
"For all the celebrations it has been
the object of in prose and song...

03:54.879 --> 03:59.145
the sea has never
been friendly to man."

03:59.217 --> 04:02.880
Nor, it seems tonight,
to man's best friend.

04:02.954 --> 04:06.481
This is Mary Beth McLaulin
for Channel Eight News.

07:34.899 --> 07:37.834
Hey! Get outta here!

25:49.426 --> 25:51.326
Hold it, pal.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.128
Thought so. You know, they got
a reward out for you.

26:08.645 --> 26:10.613
It won't be long now.

29:32.215 --> 29:34.308
Now you stay put.

31:36.806 --> 31:38.364
Hey!

32:01.898 --> 32:04.833
Sure don't wanna turn
you loose in the house.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.811
You wanna show me
how you did this?

32:48.845 --> 32:51.746
Now you stay put
till I get this mess sorted out.

33:05.094 --> 33:07.619
You better be still, or that
whole thing's gonna collapse with you.

33:17.940 --> 33:19.635
Hey!

57:16.044 --> 57:18.239
Benji!

57:21.716 --> 57:23.877
Benji!

57:26.721 --> 57:29.019
Benji, Benji!
