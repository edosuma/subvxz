00:19.303 --> 00:23.207
Bang! You're dead.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.855
Now, on the day, there'll be two guys
with Glocks at 11:00.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.337
Damn, I thought you said it was 9:00.

00:28.455 --> 00:30.600
That's why
we're rehearsing.

00:30.633 --> 00:35.205
Mind getting that thing off of me?
Gives me the creeps.

00:35.592 --> 00:38.080
There'll be no one inside that bay.

00:38.216 --> 00:40.737
Vans will pull in there.
We'll be waitin' for 'em.

00:40.777 --> 00:43.745
–Secrecy over muscle.
–Yeah.

00:45.193 --> 00:48.129
So how much dirty money
is this thing gonna be carrying?

00:48.169 --> 00:50.545
Enough for the four of us
to retire.

00:50.570 --> 00:54.274
–Sorry I'm late.
–This job depends on the four
of us having our act together.

00:54.314 --> 00:56.898
–Where the hell were you?
–I've been driving around in circles.

00:56.938 --> 00:59.331
I thought I was being followed
by some Mexican.

00:59.371 --> 01:01.826
–One of Armadillos's boys?
–I don't know.

01:01.866 --> 01:06.144
Maybe. Uh…
Maybe it's just some pizza delivery guy.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.967
Stalked by a cheese and sausage.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.611
–This greenlight thing is serious.
–You been gettin' enough sleep?

01:12.651 --> 01:15.819
Yeah, just being cautious.

01:15.853 --> 01:19.588
Okay, good. All of us should be
extra careful till we find this prick.

01:19.628 --> 01:23.044
Now that paranoia boy's here,
you gonna run through this thing again?

01:23.084 --> 01:26.499
–Till we get it right.
–All right. Let's do it.

01:26.668 --> 01:29.385
Marcy Lindhoff agreed
to a plea.

01:29.581 --> 01:31.110
How much time's
she getting?

01:31.150 --> 01:34.565
Eight years, in exchange for testimony
against her husband.

01:34.605 --> 01:37.191
Eight years?
The D.A agreed to that?

01:37.453 --> 01:40.229
To avoid shining the light
on our screwup, yes.

01:40.269 --> 01:42.920
We had the victim alive
in a car trunk…

01:43.118 --> 01:46.886
in our own parking lot for hours
until you released the main suspects…

01:46.926 --> 01:48.510
at which point she died.

01:51.886 --> 01:55.252
The D.A arranged for you
to take Marcy's statement.

01:55.311 --> 01:59.271
Confirm the facts she gave him
jive with your investigation.

02:00.527 --> 02:03.876
Dutch, the chief
called me personally.

02:04.048 --> 02:06.798
He's not pleased,
and to be honest…

02:06.991 --> 02:09.735
I'm concerned about
your performance as well.

02:09.776 --> 02:12.810
Uh, I'm going through
a rough patch.

02:12.976 --> 02:16.041
–It happens to everybody.
–Claudette says you're moody, distracted.

02:16.081 --> 02:18.023
She said that?

02:19.281 --> 02:21.161
You need to start
closing cases…

02:21.201 --> 02:24.943
and closing them
without incident.

02:25.137 --> 02:26.861
Okay.

02:31.794 --> 02:33.966
Detective!

02:34.098 --> 02:36.302
It's Doug
from the front desk.

02:36.435 --> 02:38.158
Detective!

02:38.355 --> 02:41.486
Detective,
that couple's at it again.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.783
Aren't you going to do something?

02:47.604 --> 02:49.676
Goddamn it.

02:49.716 --> 02:53.739
–You want me to back you up?
–I've only done this about 3·000 times.

02:53.779 --> 02:56.169
Okay, if you need me,
I'm here.

03:00.148 --> 03:03.661
–Yes?
–I live across the street.
I'm here about the noise.

03:03.701 --> 03:06.418
I'm sorry.
I had the TV set up too loud.

03:06.612 --> 03:09.133
Let me in. I wanna talk to the jackass
who's beatin' on you.

03:09.173 --> 03:11.533
–I'm fine, really.
–Is he still here?

03:11.573 --> 03:13.777
No.

03:13.941 --> 03:16.559
It was just an argument.

03:20.695 --> 03:23.630
–I see he talks with his hands.
–I didn't call the police.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.310
Yes, you did,
through my closed windows.

03:26.455 --> 03:30.031
–Look, it won't happen…
–I can't lay in bed and listen
to him doing it to you, okay?

03:30.071 --> 03:33.007
–So you're either gonna move…
or get some help.
–We can't afford to move!

03:33.047 --> 03:35.087
I don't need any help!

03:38.328 --> 03:42.816
If you're not gonna move,
then you're gonna get some help. Let's go.

03:48.472 --> 03:51.734
–You gonna be okay?
–Yeah, I'm perfect.

03:56.921 --> 03:59.343
Congratulations
on your plea.

03:59.514 --> 04:02.264
–Thank you.
–The plea's bullshit, Marcy.

04:02.457 --> 04:04.661
You deserve life
just like Bob.

04:04.825 --> 04:07.575
No, I mean, thank you.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.968
I guess the D.A didn't
want this to go public.

04:13.114 --> 04:17.266
You need to be 100% open and honest
with me, or you lose your deal, understood?

04:17.305 --> 04:20.754
–Yes.
–The peephole… Who put it in and why?

04:20.892 --> 04:25.050
That was Bob. He liked how Kayla looked.
He wanted to see more.

04:25.147 --> 04:29.492
–You were okay with this?
–Bob liked bringing other women into our bed.

04:29.532 --> 04:31.540
I wanted him to be happy.

04:31.676 --> 04:34.100
Did Bob want to bring Kayla
into your bed?

04:34.140 --> 04:37.902
He asked me to talk to her.
I did. She wasn't interested.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.533
So you lured her over
to your apartment one night?

04:40.573 --> 04:43.672
Bob was… obsessed.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.107
He thought
she was so pretty.

04:46.269 --> 04:49.503
Bob said it was your idea
to cut off Kayla's arm.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.715
Yeah.

04:53.886 --> 04:57.083
After that, she, uh,
she wasn't so pretty.

05:02.559 --> 05:04.479
Okay.

05:04.512 --> 05:08.279
Me and Shane are gonna clear the roof.
Ronnie, you disarm this guy.

05:08.319 --> 05:11.327
Lem, you hit the ground,
grab the truck.

05:11.361 --> 05:13.815
–Hit 'em fast and leave 'em reelin'.
–It can work.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.720
Why are we even talking about this
when Armadillo's got a hit out on us?

05:17.760 --> 05:20.377
We got feelers out on the street.
We get a call, we'll grab him.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.360
And when we do,
Vic and me got a plan.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.881
We're gonna tie him up, stick him
someplace safe till we hit the money train.

05:25.921 --> 05:28.281
Then we're gonna leave him dead
in the getaway truck.

05:28.321 --> 05:30.841
The Armenians and cops
will think the Torrucos are responsible.

05:30.881 --> 05:33.177
–Two birds with one stone.
–Only one problem.

05:33.217 --> 05:36.953
–Besides the fact we don't
know where Armadillo is?
–Stop being such a pussy.

05:36.993 --> 05:39.066
Excuse me for wanting
to stay alive.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.482
Then let's stick
to the job at hand.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.419
What are we gonna do
with the money?

05:43.459 --> 05:47.611
–It's too much to spend right
away without drawing attention.
–We launder it.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.883
Got a friend who just bought into a restaurant.
Practically an all-cash business.

05:49.923 --> 05:53.982
That's what I.A.D is gonna look into.
We can't do this alone.

05:54.115 --> 05:56.359
You're sayin'
let someone else in?

05:56.515 --> 06:01.436
Someone we can control, who's gonna
be more afraid of us than going to prison.

06:01.476 --> 06:03.897
You used to know
a guy named Tio?

06:05.796 --> 06:08.540
–Why are we not in a police station?
–Theodore Osmond, drug dealer.

06:08.580 --> 06:12.028
Guy you helped to buy
a comic book shop in another building.

06:12.068 --> 06:15.941
Tio, sure. I heard somebody, uh,
burned him to death.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.557
–That's terrible.
–So you did sell him the store?

06:18.597 --> 06:21.406
I brokered that deal.
I'm a licensed realtor.

06:21.446 --> 06:23.293
–Then you know Tio sold
narcotics out of that store.
–No.

06:23.333 --> 06:26.910
He bought the place cash.
Where'd you think he got his money from?

06:26.950 --> 06:29.310
I don't ask my clients
where they get their money.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.806
Is that because most of your clients
are drug dealers?

06:31.846 --> 06:34.399
I think you specialize
in buying property for drug dealers…

06:34.439 --> 06:36.155
so they can launder money.

06:36.326 --> 06:38.783
–Isn't that right?
–This is ridiculous.

06:38.823 --> 06:41.212
Checked your files,
Leith.

06:41.383 --> 06:43.527
Tied you to four
major dealers.

06:43.561 --> 06:47.619
How'd you like to see
our police station now?

06:47.912 --> 06:49.919
I don't touch
any of that.

06:50.056 --> 06:51.998
I just buy and sell
property.

06:52.135 --> 06:55.616
The only property you're gonna be
sellin' now is bunk space in Pelican Bay.

06:55.656 --> 06:57.445
Please.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.804
Wh-What do you guys want?

07:01.001 --> 07:02.757
Real estate.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.570
She'll have to be wait-listed
at another shelter.

07:17.610 --> 07:21.768
Can't you pull some strings?
She's a neighbor. You're a friend.

07:22.058 --> 07:25.187
I filled my last bed this morning.
What about a hotel?

07:25.227 --> 07:27.911
She can't afford a hotel.

07:28.171 --> 07:30.595
I might be able
to double her up someplace.

07:30.635 --> 07:33.188
Do, and I'll owe you dinner.

07:33.387 --> 07:36.355
Even if I find a spot,
she's not gonna go.

07:36.492 --> 07:40.332
And I'm partial
to steak joints.

07:40.366 --> 07:43.781
They don't leave until they call
from the street or the hospital.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.659
She didn't even call.
It's a waste of time.

07:46.797 --> 07:49.928
Just find a bed.
I'll put her in it.

07:51.917 --> 07:54.535
Is that everything?

07:54.734 --> 07:56.938
Yeah. We're done.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.770
Why'd you do this?

08:05.934 --> 08:09.447
It just kind of… happened.

08:10.639 --> 08:13.159
No, I mean, uh…

08:13.359 --> 08:16.076
what made you think
you could fool me?

08:18.671 --> 08:20.613
I didn't fool you.

08:20.752 --> 08:22.956
I just let you
fool yourself.

08:27.183 --> 08:29.872
Dutch, how'd it go?

08:29.905 --> 08:32.712
–I got everything I needed.
–Good, 'cause we got a case.

08:32.751 --> 08:35.981
Woman strangled to death
in Fairview Park.

08:36.336 --> 08:38.092
You sure you want
my help?

08:38.129 --> 08:41.577
According to Aceveda,
I'm moody and distracted.

08:43.376 --> 08:45.101
He said that to you?

08:47.218 --> 08:50.474
Why am I even in a police station?
I didn't do anything.

08:50.514 --> 08:52.238
Fine. Go home.

08:52.370 --> 08:56.170
Next time Prince Charming starts using you
for sparring practice, keep it down.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.953
Look… I know it's hard
to leave your home.

09:00.275 --> 09:03.980
–It was hard my first time.
–I don't need a damn shelter.

09:04.020 --> 09:09.036
Sometimes staying away even one night
makes him realize he's crossed a line.

09:09.043 --> 09:11.247
If you don't do it now…

09:11.411 --> 09:13.779
you might never get
another chance.

09:17.748 --> 09:20.972
–I don't even have any of my stuff.
–Here, give me your keys.

09:21.012 --> 09:24.975
–I'll bring you whatever you need.
–I don't want you in my house!

09:25.015 --> 09:27.283
I'll get you some clothes.

09:32.213 --> 09:34.417
You can't make somebody
get help.

09:34.549 --> 09:36.429
Sure you can.
Keep working on her.

09:36.469 --> 09:38.350
You don't know
what you're talking about.

09:38.390 --> 09:42.190
So eight years as a street cop cleanin'
up messes like this means nothin'?

09:42.230 --> 09:45.711
It's a different game when you're the one
on the receiving end of a fist.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.527
That's why the next time this guy wakes me up,
I'm gonna have a chat with him.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.672
It'll stop. Trust me.

09:50.806 --> 09:52.654
Stop violence
with violence?

09:52.727 --> 09:55.037
Why do men
always have the answers?

09:55.192 --> 09:56.980
That's a good question.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.648
–Any witnesses?
–No.

10:05.816 --> 10:08.658
Couple of teenagers smoking joints
discovered the body.

10:08.698 --> 10:11.414
Found her purse and wallet
in the bushes.

10:11.769 --> 10:14.191
Her name's
Leah Madson.

10:14.361 --> 10:16.977
Never seen a victim strangled
with an over-the-shoulder boulder holder.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.189
I'm not in the mood, Ray.

10:19.257 --> 10:23.218
M.E said no prints
on the victim's body.

10:23.418 --> 10:26.545
Doesn't appear to have been forcibly
removed. Bra's not damaged either.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.073
But the clasp is missing.

10:29.242 --> 10:33.299
–Probably fell off when he strangled her.
–What are you thinking?

10:33.339 --> 10:36.885
I don't know.
Uh, rape turned homicide maybe.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.767
What's this?
Chocolate?

10:44.283 --> 10:47.092
It's on her fingers.
Means she helped him remove the bra.

10:47.132 --> 10:49.652
This didn't start off
as a rape.

10:49.852 --> 10:51.766
–They knew each other.
–Yeah.

10:51.836 --> 10:54.292
Guess I'm wrong again.

10:56.604 --> 10:59.310
Downtown just faxed
a list of promotions.

10:59.484 --> 11:02.581
Stewart and Hernandez
got the two senior lead officer spots.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.654
I was next in line
for that.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.869
I know.

11:07.903 --> 11:11.573
This has to do with the complaint
the widow's been filing against me, huh?

11:11.613 --> 11:13.910
The marijuana I.A.D
found in my car.

11:13.950 --> 11:16.854
I.A.D believed you. There's no reason
that should have any bearing…

11:16.894 --> 11:19.000
Come on!
That promotion was a lock.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.223
You're telling me this has nothing to do
with the bogus complaints put against me?

11:23.263 --> 11:27.949
Of course that's what this is about,
but the brass will never admit it.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.229
You're gonna have to
ride this out.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.379
Detective Vendrell.

11:36.575 --> 11:38.489
There's somebody here
to see you.

11:38.529 --> 11:42.686
Well, well, it's the penis flytrap.
Hope you're not a daddy.

11:47.553 --> 11:50.236
Hey, Georgia.
Can I talk to you?

11:50.433 --> 11:52.442
I'm, uh…
I'm a little busy right now.

11:52.482 --> 11:55.711
I got a case.
Illegal activities.

12:01.122 --> 12:05.214
My ex, selling 'scrip drugs
to illegals, grannies…

12:05.378 --> 12:07.643
anyone looking for
a cheap way to medicate.

12:07.683 --> 12:11.452
–Sounds like you found
yourself a real winner.
–I said my ex.

12:11.492 --> 12:15.707
Bastard was banging my neighbor while I was
sweating my ass off at the strip club.

12:15.747 --> 12:19.420
Figured the best way to pay him back
would just be to drop a dime on him.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.435
Still all class, huh?

12:21.572 --> 12:24.892
Are you still upset
about what happened between us?

12:24.932 --> 12:26.780
Nothing happened
between us.

12:26.852 --> 12:28.674
Come on.
It was just fun.

12:28.868 --> 12:31.551
No. It was blackmail.

12:31.748 --> 12:34.137
Seriously.

12:34.309 --> 12:36.797
My ex,
he's a bad dude…

12:36.997 --> 12:41.029
and I would only trust
a really good cop with this.

12:41.063 --> 12:44.641
Look around and take your pick.
I'm not your guy.

12:48.421 --> 12:52.131
So why aren't we following up
on Tulips's lead?

12:52.326 --> 12:54.049
She's a lying whore.

12:54.246 --> 12:55.808
I trusted her,
and she screwed me.

12:55.848 --> 12:58.750
From what I saw that day,
the screwing was mutual.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.671
I just don't want to
be around her.

13:00.711 --> 13:05.463
So we lose an easy bust on our record
because you got played for a fool?

13:08.936 --> 13:11.140
Fine. Fine.

13:12.776 --> 13:15.111
Brent. Brent, it's okay.
I got it.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.793
You, come with me.

13:17.992 --> 13:19.748
Groovy.

13:19.976 --> 13:22.246
You know this woman, Stu?

13:26.249 --> 13:29.058
This girl at the rib joint I work at
set me up with her.

13:29.098 --> 13:32.226
–Went out with her last night?
–We met at her place at 9:00.

13:32.266 --> 13:34.088
How long did you stay?

13:34.282 --> 13:36.658
I didn't.
I wasn't attracted to her.

13:36.681 --> 13:38.690
I figured,
why waste both our time?

13:38.730 --> 13:40.619
–Where'd you go then?
–Home.

13:40.652 --> 13:44.263
–Anyone who can corroborate that?
–I don't think so.

13:44.618 --> 13:47.717
I just went home,
watched some TV.

13:47.850 --> 13:50.306
Any word on Stu's alibi?

13:50.475 --> 13:52.198
No one to confirm
or deny.

13:52.395 --> 13:55.173
–What about his coworkers?
–I'm heading over to talk to them now.

13:55.213 --> 13:58.117
Long as I'm not too moody
to change my mind…

13:58.284 --> 14:01.034
or too distracted
to lose my way.

14:03.661 --> 14:07.205
Why is what I said to you in confidence
about Dutch coming back to me?

14:07.245 --> 14:09.415
Because his results lately
are a concern.

14:09.455 --> 14:12.773
I was concerned about Dutch personally,
not about his job performance.

14:12.813 --> 14:15.944
It's not just me.
This is the chief.

14:16.173 --> 14:18.439
Bob and Marcy were a serious
black eye for us.

14:18.479 --> 14:21.350
It happened right under the nose
of our civilian auditor.

14:21.390 --> 14:24.102
–Is Lanie behind this?
–She hasn't been here in a few weeks.

14:24.142 --> 14:26.990
Who knows who
she's talking to?

14:27.024 --> 14:30.791
Until further notice, you'll be
lead investigator on all your cases.

14:30.831 --> 14:35.110
Oh. How is Dutch supposed to get back on
the horse when you cut him off at the knees?

14:35.150 --> 14:38.023
–I just don't want to see him screw up again.
–He won't.

14:38.063 --> 14:40.682
I hope not.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.591
–Because if he does,
I can't protect him anymore.
–Why?

14:43.631 --> 14:45.803
Too busy protecting Vic?

14:59.952 --> 15:01.897
Who the hell are you?
What the…

15:01.937 --> 15:04.719
–I'm a cop.
–What do you want?

15:04.913 --> 15:07.946
Look, I don't know what she told you,
but she's a lying bitch.

15:07.986 --> 15:11.434
She said it was all her fault.
You didn't touch her.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.455
The lying bitch.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.800
Hey, where you going?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.506
Where is she, man?

15:23.667 --> 15:26.373
What, you sleepin' with her
or somethin'?

15:27.667 --> 15:30.635
Answer me, man!

15:30.739 --> 15:33.036
That's not hers. It's my sister's.
Give it back.

15:33.076 --> 15:35.759
I said give it back!

15:35.956 --> 15:37.492
Thanks, asshole.

15:37.526 --> 15:40.788
–You just made me a very happy man.
–Ow!

15:44.405 --> 15:46.319
Thank you
for bringing lunch.

15:46.325 --> 15:51.377
Wait till you see the spread you get
when you're actually my husband.

15:51.509 --> 15:54.797
So it's okay if I drop off Randall later
when I get my dress fitted?

15:54.837 --> 15:58.514
–Sure.
–What's wrong? You seem a little distracted.

15:58.710 --> 16:02.158
–Uh…
–Don't tell me. Cold feet.

16:02.358 --> 16:04.180
No, no. No.

16:05.687 --> 16:10.160
–So?
–Um…

16:10.391 --> 16:13.839
The prayer group that I go to
on Thursday night isn't just Bible study.

16:13.879 --> 16:16.399
What else is it?

16:16.600 --> 16:21.139
–It's also a sexual reorientation group.
–Reorientation?

16:21.336 --> 16:24.565
I've made some bad choices
in my past.

16:24.728 --> 16:27.990
–Bad relationship choices.
–We all have.

16:28.152 --> 16:30.000
–It's okay.
–Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.715
Um…

16:35.577 --> 16:37.911
I used to be attracted
to men…

16:38.073 --> 16:41.905
but through counseling and the grace of God
and Jesus, I've straightened myself…

16:41.945 --> 16:43.826
–You're gay?
–No. No, I am not.

16:43.866 --> 16:46.233
Oh, God. God.

16:46.394 --> 16:49.970
–Randall looks to you like you're his father.
–Vanessa. Vanessa.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.650
I am the man that God
intended me to be.

16:52.731 --> 16:56.019
I am with a beautiful woman.
I'm about to start a family.

16:56.059 --> 16:58.707
I love you.
I just didn't want any secrets.

16:58.747 --> 17:01.715
–When was the last time you were with a guy?
–It has been months.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.860
I've been in this group
for months.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.867
You had sex with a man?

17:09.788 --> 17:14.557
I… I have made mistakes
in my past…

17:14.589 --> 17:18.517
but I am begging you for your
understanding and your forgiveness.

17:18.557 --> 17:22.419
I need you.
I need you.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.244
I need to think.

17:37.342 --> 17:40.728
Hey, hey, baby! Baby!
Baby, tell them it's all good with us!

17:40.768 --> 17:43.799
You said you wouldn't arrest him!
He's on parole!

17:43.839 --> 17:46.775
If he goes to jail, he loses his job.
I lose my apartment.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.984
–You stay alive, and I get some goddamn sleep.
–Keep your hands off her!

17:49.024 --> 17:51.796
–He didn't hit me. Let him go.
–Stay back.

17:51.839 --> 17:53.911
–I'll take her.
–Baby, get me out of here.

17:53.951 --> 17:56.056
–Call Skeeter. He knows a bail guy.
–Shut up.

17:56.096 --> 17:57.977
A couple can hit each other,
hate each other…

17:58.017 --> 18:02.328
but tell them they're wrong
for each other, they look at you
like you're speaking in tongues.

18:02.368 --> 18:05.150
Gee, I never heard that before.

18:05.345 --> 18:09.625
You actually thought she wouldn't go back
to him? Are you unromantic or just dumb?

18:09.665 --> 18:12.025
I just didn't want to
hear 'em in my living room anymore.

18:12.065 --> 18:15.579
It's harder to get out
than you think.

18:15.713 --> 18:19.034
–Like the bad boys, did we?
–It had its appeal for a while.

18:19.074 --> 18:22.009
And then it didn't.
She hasn't hit bottom.

18:22.146 --> 18:23.935
She's not ready
for me yet.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.202
He touches her again,
he's mine.

18:26.242 --> 18:29.082
You just can't stand
anything you can't control.

18:29.122 --> 18:31.578
That's part of my dance.

18:38.371 --> 18:43.041
Your, uh, coworkers say you're a bit
obsessive about your weight.

18:43.236 --> 18:46.138
Summers at fat farms,
dozens of diets…

18:46.276 --> 18:48.708
weight training,
yoga, running.

18:48.741 --> 18:51.708
–All true.
–What happened with Susan Lane?

18:52.196 --> 18:55.165
Aggravated assault
when you were 12 years old.

18:55.205 --> 18:58.205
That's what they called it. She didn't want
people to think she was a slut.

18:58.245 --> 19:01.375
Now, you and some other kids
were playing spin-the-bottle.

19:01.415 --> 19:03.989
On her spin,
the bottle pointed to you.

19:10.278 --> 19:15.167
She was supposed to kiss you.
She refused. You were humiliated.

19:15.302 --> 19:19.132
So 11 years later, I killed some chick?
Come on!

19:19.271 --> 19:22.111
A few days later, you followed
Susan home from school.

19:22.151 --> 19:24.415
You told her to kiss you.
She refused.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.495
You struck her.
You broke her nose.

19:26.535 --> 19:28.903
She tried to kiss me.
I wouldn't.

19:29.064 --> 19:31.519
She slapped me,
so I hit her.

19:31.688 --> 19:34.176
You were the last person
to see Leah Madson alive, Stu.

19:34.216 --> 19:37.664
–Except the killer.
–Yeah, except the killer.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.729
Pretty quiet in there.
Any thoughts?

19:45.929 --> 19:48.679
Uh… hard to read.

19:50.250 --> 19:54.474
–Let's check his apartment,
see what we can come up with.
–Yeah.

19:57.066 --> 19:59.906
Keep it short and simple.
Tell him I got a supply, I need a buyer.

19:59.946 --> 20:02.787
Just, uh, get a time and place
and then hang up the phone.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.155
–How come you don't look at me?
–What?

20:05.195 --> 20:07.399
You don't look at me.

20:07.563 --> 20:10.465
Just make
the goddamn call.

20:10.603 --> 20:12.392
God.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.448
It's me.

20:25.644 --> 20:27.460
Mmm, look,
I don't want to fight.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.053
I've got a guy who wants to
hook you up with some product.

20:30.093 --> 20:34.383
Hell, yeah, I'm still pissed,
but you know what? A buck's a buck.

20:37.933 --> 20:40.901
–Danny, find the bra clasp?
–Nothing yet.

20:41.389 --> 20:44.291
I'm guessing it's here
or in his car.

20:44.430 --> 20:47.299
Maybe on a shoe or, uh…

20:50.798 --> 20:54.626
We find that bra clasp,
we've got this guy dead to rights.

20:54.703 --> 20:56.492
We're lookin'.

21:06.351 --> 21:08.140
Odd place.

21:14.737 --> 21:17.607
What's it tell you
about our guy?

21:17.745 --> 21:19.505
Uh… I don't know.

21:19.538 --> 21:23.400
You must be thinking something.
What's your gut tell you?

21:25.298 --> 21:28.268
There are red flags
everywhere with this guy.

21:28.497 --> 21:31.599
–Red flags for what?
–Possible serial predator.

21:31.762 --> 21:33.706
–Think he's a serial killer?
–Or a rapist.

21:33.746 --> 21:36.906
He has the makings of one…
the obsession with detail…

21:36.946 --> 21:39.313
the, uh, reliance
on fantasy.

21:39.475 --> 21:41.555
They're warning posts.

21:41.588 --> 21:46.208
He's young, and if he is one,
I'm guessing Leah's his first or second.

21:47.283 --> 21:50.382
–You know, it's a bunch of crap.
–No, no.

21:50.515 --> 21:53.676
We got nothing else to go on.
It's worth exploring.

21:53.716 --> 21:56.492
–We need to find the bra clasp, people.
–Our guys are already on it.

21:56.532 --> 22:00.030
Let's go back to the barn,
get a confession from Stu.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.085
–I don't have anything to work with.
–You've done it before.

22:03.125 --> 22:08.537
I'm gonna head back to the crime scene,
make sure those guys didn't miss anything.

22:15.829 --> 22:19.854
Three, four million, I can get you
a few 10-acre lots in Castro Peak.

22:19.894 --> 22:22.062
They'll appreciate nice
in a few years.

22:22.102 --> 22:25.534
Nothing in your name,
but you'll have total control.

22:25.686 --> 22:28.439
–All cash.
–All cash.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.023
I usually get
a five-percent commission.

22:31.063 --> 22:34.576
–Why don't we make it ten percent?
–Uh…

22:34.776 --> 22:36.499
Ten?

22:36.696 --> 22:39.860
Good faith.

22:41.047 --> 22:44.400
Plus a little extra money,
since you're taking the extra risk.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.098
What extra risk?

22:46.297 --> 22:48.271
Well…

22:48.409 --> 22:50.768
if you even think
about rattin' us out…

22:50.808 --> 22:54.865
we tell the four drug dealers you've been doin'
business with that you ratted them out.

22:54.905 --> 22:57.141
Bang, bang.

22:58.841 --> 23:01.143
I understand.

23:06.042 --> 23:08.882
Look, you guys searched
my apartment, right?

23:08.922 --> 23:12.914
There was nothing there.
I'd be hearing about it if there was.

23:12.954 --> 23:16.211
If you're so innocent, maybe you'd like
to take a lie detector test?

23:16.251 --> 23:18.040
No.

23:19.387 --> 23:21.176
Afraid of something?

23:21.371 --> 23:23.892
No, I just hear
they're not so reliable.

23:23.932 --> 23:27.694
What if I took it, and it said
I was guilty when I'm not?

23:31.868 --> 23:35.829
He's suspicious but clean.
Dutch has a theory though.

23:35.965 --> 23:38.169
What's your theory,
Claudette?

23:38.300 --> 23:40.210
I don't have one.
Ask Dutch.

23:40.349 --> 23:42.072
It's nothing.

23:42.269 --> 23:44.058
He thinks Stu's guilty.

23:44.253 --> 23:46.563
He shows signs
of being a predator.

23:46.717 --> 23:50.462
–We have any proof?
–There are definite warning signs.

23:50.495 --> 23:54.614
He refused to take a lie detector,
talked about getting a false guilty reading.

23:54.654 --> 23:56.766
Nobody who's innocent
does that.

23:58.622 --> 24:02.714
Thinking he's guilty is one thing,
proving it's another.

24:02.814 --> 24:05.498
Find out who did it
and close this case.

24:11.007 --> 24:14.807
A night at a shelter is a good first step,
so how do we get her to take it?

24:14.847 --> 24:18.936
–Not by forcing her caveman style.
–I do have to get some sleep.

24:18.976 --> 24:21.080
And I wanna see her
stay in one piece.

24:21.120 --> 24:25.398
I have been known in dire times
of resorting to trickery.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.732
If I spend a night
in the shelter…

24:28.865 --> 24:32.127
Dez won't have to
spend a night in jail.

24:32.289 --> 24:34.656
It's a new city law.

24:34.817 --> 24:37.274
We have to hold alleged
abusers overnight…

24:37.314 --> 24:39.037
for the woman's safety.

24:41.634 --> 24:44.736
Okay, then. I wanna try your place
for a night.

24:44.802 --> 24:47.136
Good.

25:05.284 --> 25:08.154
Nice tits.
How much they cost?

25:08.292 --> 25:10.332
Hundred percent natural.
Jealous?

25:10.372 --> 25:12.989
–Is she legal?
–Born in Inglewood, bitch.

25:13.029 --> 25:16.701
–I meant is she 18, stupid?
–Yeah, and I take her everywhere with me.

25:16.741 --> 25:19.101
–She doesn't piss me off.
–Screw you.

25:19.141 --> 25:21.917
–Not anymore.
–Ah, and you miss it. He gets it all now.

25:21.957 --> 25:24.350
So this asshole's
your new boyfriend?

25:24.390 --> 25:28.510
–Yeah, it's a relief not
having to fake it anymore.
–Can we get down to business?

25:28.550 --> 25:30.118
So what you got?

25:30.152 --> 25:33.697
–Uh… Ex, oxy, pot, mash, stash, Rx.
–I need Viagra.

25:34.246 --> 25:36.221
Yeah, you do.

25:36.358 --> 25:38.399
Anything to make it bigger
like my man's?

25:38.439 --> 25:40.894
–I need “V” and Ex. That'll be all.
–How much weight you need?

25:40.934 --> 25:43.647
Start out slow.
How 'bout five-grand worth?

25:43.687 --> 25:45.733
Five grand?
Yeah, I'm your man.

25:45.832 --> 25:48.833
–Don't forget about my cut.
–I pay loverboy.
You get your money from him.

25:48.873 --> 25:51.904
–That wasn't the deal. That was not the deal!
–Is now.

25:51.944 --> 25:55.442
–Just get in the car, dear.
–Anything you say, honey.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.807
Here you go.

26:05.225 --> 26:07.200
You got the money?

26:13.162 --> 26:14.885
Here's your 5K.

26:14.986 --> 26:17.858
–If this stuff sucks, I'm comin' after her.
–Be my guest.

26:17.898 --> 26:21.264
–He doesn't mean that. That's love talk.
–Let's go.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.218
All right. Let's go. Piggies in the air!

26:25.258 --> 26:27.266
Right now!
Turn around!

26:27.403 --> 26:29.892
Come on! Turn around, high life boy!
Let's go! Hands on your head.

26:29.932 --> 26:32.003
You too, darling. Let's go.
Hands on your head.

26:32.043 --> 26:36.648
You dumb a-hole! You just got busted
by my new big-dick boyfriend!

26:36.844 --> 26:39.811
How does it feel, you fag?
Aah!

26:39.948 --> 26:42.315
–How does it feel?
–Bitch!

26:42.476 --> 26:45.924
Will you shut up?
Damn it.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.733
You ever know
somebody's guilty…

26:58.894 --> 27:01.158
but you just don't
have the evidence?

27:01.198 --> 27:03.653
–On occasion.
–How do you handle it?

27:05.390 --> 27:07.150
You wearin' a wire?

27:07.183 --> 27:10.153
I'm tired of people
gettin' away with murder.

27:14.351 --> 27:17.253
Sometimes the evidence
fits the case.

27:17.391 --> 27:21.548
Sometimes you gotta
make the evidence fit the case.

27:23.215 --> 27:26.281
If you know the guy did it.

27:52.402 --> 27:55.053
We're still working it.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.594
–Hey, still didn't find anything?
–The place is clean.

28:03.634 --> 28:06.864
–I'm gonna take one last look.
–Sure.

28:28.693 --> 28:30.893
–Well?
–You sure you were thorough?

28:30.933 --> 28:33.677
–Yeah.
–Do me a favor. Check one more time.

28:33.717 --> 28:36.270
The trash, uh, his clothes.

28:36.470 --> 28:40.034
–You gonna sign for the overtime?
–Yeah. Just be sure.

29:07.897 --> 29:09.806
Yeah?

29:09.977 --> 29:12.246
I think
I left somethin'.

29:39.483 --> 29:42.069
–You okay?
–Yeah. You?

29:42.267 --> 29:44.722
Actually, I'm not.
I'm having…

29:46.812 --> 29:48.535
A really bad day.

29:50.684 --> 29:52.407
We busted him, didn't we?

29:52.604 --> 29:56.052
This whole thing was about you burning some
guy who dumped you for somebody hotter.

29:56.092 --> 29:57.816
It was not.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.628
And no way was that taco tart
hotter than me.

30:00.668 --> 30:05.241
–You don't think so, do you?
–I think you use people.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.774
You're really upset
with me.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.930
–You got what you wanted.
Just get out of here.
–Oh… my God.

30:13.597 --> 30:16.631
I really hurt you,
just like he hurt me.

30:16.766 --> 30:19.254
–I'm sorry.
–Doesn't matter.

30:19.422 --> 30:21.750
I'm always falling
for the wrong guys…

30:21.790 --> 30:24.151
when I'd just be better off
with someone like you.

30:24.191 --> 30:27.225
Yeah, you would,
but you'll never know.

30:31.615 --> 30:34.780
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

30:34.944 --> 30:37.368
I got like six hours
left on my shift.

30:37.408 --> 30:39.317
Oh.

30:39.456 --> 30:43.996
Well, don't you have to, um,
interrogate me or something?

30:44.161 --> 30:46.365
You know, just to wrap it up.

31:08.034 --> 31:11.418
–Come on. I'm bailed. Let's go, baby.
–She's not going home with you.

31:11.458 --> 31:14.267
–You stay out of my business, bitch.
–She's not going home with you.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.668
–Emma?
–I'm doing this for you. It's the law.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.803
What law? They can't keep us apart.
Come on. Let's go.

31:19.843 --> 31:22.620
She needs a break from your macho bullshit,
so go hit somebody else tonight.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.700
You want some too,
bitch?

31:27.812 --> 31:30.431
Dez!

31:30.628 --> 31:34.371
What's going on?
Hey, hey. Stay still. Stay still.

31:34.564 --> 31:37.052
Oops.

31:40.581 --> 31:42.213
It was self-defense.

31:42.247 --> 31:45.533
–She pushed a man off the balcony.
–He was attacking her.

31:45.573 --> 31:49.310
It happened on our property.
There are legal and civil considerations.

31:49.350 --> 31:51.550
–I don't want her in the cage.
–Then bail her out.

31:51.590 --> 31:54.012
Thanks for your help.

32:02.438 --> 32:04.220
–Come on. Let's go.
–Where?

32:07.463 --> 32:11.039
–What are you doing?
–Had some bad mojo in there lately.

32:11.079 --> 32:12.835
I need a new room.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.072
It's all yours,
Dutch-boy.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.753
You couldn't take a lie detector
if you wanted to…

32:22.793 --> 32:25.601
because the wire wouldn't fit
around that thick wrist of yours.

32:25.641 --> 32:28.354
–What?
–You know what word you never use, Stu?

32:28.394 --> 32:32.161
“Fat.” I bet people don't call you that
to your face either.

32:32.201 --> 32:35.809
They're too polite.
They should, though, because… you are fat.

32:35.849 --> 32:38.370
You were a fat baby.
You were a fat little kid…

32:38.410 --> 32:41.345
and now you're just
a goddamn whale.

32:41.482 --> 32:43.490
I-I've busted
black killers…

32:43.626 --> 32:46.339
white killers,
smart killers, dumb killers.

32:46.379 --> 32:48.419
Never anybody
as fat as you.

32:48.555 --> 32:51.938
See, the bra you used
to strangle Leah with…

32:52.108 --> 32:54.279
the clasp was broken.

32:54.411 --> 32:57.252
Your, uh, fat fingers
weren't nimble enough to unclasp it…

32:57.292 --> 33:00.554
so you just ripped it off her,
didn't you, Stu?

33:00.651 --> 33:04.524
Which means that bra clasp
is somewhere in your house…

33:04.558 --> 33:08.932
your car, your extra, extra,
extra-large clothes.

33:10.860 --> 33:13.828
I don't need
a lie detector, Stu.

33:13.965 --> 33:16.747
I can get you
on physical evidence.

33:16.941 --> 33:19.178
And let me
tell you something.

33:19.342 --> 33:21.513
A jail cell feels small…

33:21.646 --> 33:24.363
to someone my size.

33:26.222 --> 33:29.189
He's going too far.

33:29.326 --> 33:32.675
–You can't get me.
–I'm gonna get you right here.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.635
I'm unstoppable.

33:38.511 --> 33:40.715
Hey, big guy,
your mom's here.

33:40.879 --> 33:44.141
–Hey, baby.
–Hey, Mom.

33:45.808 --> 33:49.108
Baby, keep your grandma company.
She's in the car.

33:49.138 --> 33:51.816
–I parked it out back, okay?
–Okay. See you, Julien.

33:51.856 --> 33:54.158
See you later, big guy.

34:01.009 --> 34:03.466
–You should've told me sooner.
–I know.

34:03.506 --> 34:05.294
I'm sorry.

34:06.738 --> 34:10.797
I believe you when you say
that you've changed.

34:10.962 --> 34:13.802
–I believe in the power of our Lord.
–Thank you.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.630
But…

34:17.330 --> 34:20.713
if you ever feel…
like you want to be with a man…

34:20.915 --> 34:23.500
–I won't. I won't. I never…
–I need…

34:23.699 --> 34:25.422
I never will be again.

34:25.715 --> 34:28.399
I'm gonna make
the two of you so happy.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.096
Kiss me.

35:01.718 --> 35:03.442
Okay.

35:03.606 --> 35:07.500
Well, uh, I have a hundred things to do
before the wedding.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.614
Okay.

35:09.751 --> 35:11.540
Okay.

35:12.727 --> 35:14.516
So, um…

35:16.087 --> 35:18.575
so the wedding's
still on?

35:18.744 --> 35:21.264
Don't keep me waiting
up there, okay?

35:21.528 --> 35:23.284
Never.

35:31.417 --> 35:34.002
–She's a beautiful girl.
–Yeah.

35:34.201 --> 35:36.656
I guess I must have
missed somethin'.

35:39.641 --> 35:43.286
Last person I saw you kissin'
was a little more… male.

35:46.041 --> 35:49.140
–You sure you know what you're doin'?
–Yeah.

35:52.538 --> 35:56.084
In that case,
congratulations.

36:04.251 --> 36:07.379
When was the last time you saw
your dick without using a mirror?

36:07.419 --> 36:09.623
Shut up.

36:09.820 --> 36:13.398
So you got set up on a blind date
with Leah Madson.

36:13.596 --> 36:15.580
Oh, wow.

36:15.614 --> 36:18.964
I mean, her friend was cute.
You must have expected a hottie.

36:19.004 --> 36:22.387
Nope. Instead
it's big, fat Leah.

36:24.477 --> 36:26.965
I mean, you deserve better, right?

36:27.133 --> 36:29.206
–I get better.
–No, you don't.

36:29.341 --> 36:31.708
Women won't sleep
with you.

36:33.437 --> 36:35.096
So you're horny.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.426
You figure, what the hell…
park's dark.

36:38.558 --> 36:40.984
Wh-What's the old joke
about fat chicks?

36:41.024 --> 36:44.155
Roll 'em in flour
and aim for the wet spot.

36:44.639 --> 36:47.934
Hey, is that…
is that what it's like?

36:48.095 --> 36:51.128
–I wasn't attracted to her.
–I know.

36:51.327 --> 36:54.456
Leah was fat. She couldn't stop eating.
She had no control.

36:54.496 --> 36:56.219
You hated that.

36:56.416 --> 36:58.685
But there you are…

36:58.848 --> 37:01.052
on that park bench…

37:01.216 --> 37:05.902
hating yourself for every minute
you can't control your little hard-on.

37:07.969 --> 37:10.686
You had this
in your fridge for years.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.302
Never took a bite.
Mmm.

37:15.329 --> 37:19.290
The chocolate bar
was the trigger.

37:19.425 --> 37:22.842
You wanted to get laid. All she could think
about was the candy in her pocket.

37:22.882 --> 37:25.522
She pulled it out,
and you just lost it.

37:25.666 --> 37:28.763
Strangled her with the same bra your
fat fingers were fumbling to get off of her.

37:28.803 --> 37:31.486
That's not who I am.

37:31.683 --> 37:35.611
–Yeah.
–Tell him you found the bra clasp.

37:35.747 --> 37:38.136
Good to know.

37:38.308 --> 37:40.282
We found
the bra clasp, Stu.

37:40.419 --> 37:42.394
It was in your car.

37:42.531 --> 37:45.281
–I'm not fat.
–Yeah, you're not fat.

37:45.476 --> 37:49.371
I'll kill you too!
Say I'm fat! Say I'm fat!

37:49.508 --> 37:51.836
I'm gonna be thin!
I am! I'm gonna be!

37:51.876 --> 37:53.981
I'm gonna be thin!

37:54.117 --> 37:56.253
Help! Get some help!
Get off of him!

37:56.293 --> 37:59.260
Come on! Get off!
Get off!

38:00.677 --> 38:02.987
Don't move. Don't move.
Cuffhim up.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.163
Hey, Ronnie.

38:11.238 --> 38:14.846
Shane got the pictures back. I don't want 'em
lying around for anyone else to find.

38:14.886 --> 38:16.958
–Can you run 'em by my place?
–Sure.

38:16.998 --> 38:20.577
Listen, while you're there,
can you get my checkbook?

38:20.807 --> 38:23.015
How come?

38:23.049 --> 38:26.847
State won't pony up the money
for a decent burial for Connie.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.204
I figure it's
the least I can do.

38:30.471 --> 38:34.208
Hey, careful out there. I hear the Thai food
delivery guys are packin' heat.

38:34.248 --> 38:36.096
–You guys are dicks.
–Jesus!

38:36.264 --> 38:39.745
Take a joke! God!

38:42.569 --> 38:45.442
If he's freakin' out now, how's he gonna
be takin' down the money train?

38:45.482 --> 38:47.489
Or when it comes time
to take care of Armadillo?

38:47.529 --> 38:49.251
You trust him every day
bustin' down doors.

38:49.291 --> 38:52.513
Doesn't mean I trust him to sit
on a few million for a year or two.

38:52.553 --> 38:55.237
Money does strange things
to people.

38:56.298 --> 38:58.872
All right. We'll keep
an eye on Ronnie.

38:58.922 --> 39:02.786
–You finish up with Tulips?
–Yeah, it was a clean bust. No hitches.

39:02.826 --> 39:05.477
–Nice work.
–Yeah.

39:12.555 --> 39:14.278
Nice job.

39:14.475 --> 39:16.482
Don't sound so surprised.

39:16.619 --> 39:19.395
Well, I was just worried
about you for a little while.

39:19.435 --> 39:22.502
You should have had
more faith in me.

39:22.636 --> 39:25.320
–Nice work.
–I know.

39:25.516 --> 39:27.938
–I'm glad.
–You should be.

39:28.109 --> 39:31.469
I break cases nobody else
in this division can.

39:31.502 --> 39:35.397
I deserve a little more goddamn respect
than I've been getting around here lately.

39:35.437 --> 39:38.667
You wanted me to close a case
without incident?

39:38.830 --> 39:40.837
I did it.

39:42.477 --> 39:44.201
I guess he's back.

39:44.397 --> 39:46.819
I guess so.

39:51.790 --> 39:56.476
You run off to Mexico and miss your
court date, you owe me three grand.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.795
You play with fire,
that's the chance you'll take.

40:00.847 --> 40:02.855
Is he okay?

40:02.991 --> 40:05.413
Unfortunately.

40:05.584 --> 40:07.592
–Guess I should feel bad.
–Don't.

40:07.632 --> 40:11.211
Sorry.

40:12.848 --> 40:15.565
–Hello?
–Matthew's been asking for you.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.604
–He wants to say hi.
–Great. Put him on.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.451
Okay.
Say hi to Daddy.

40:21.649 --> 40:23.372
Matthew,
say hi to Daddy.

40:23.569 --> 40:25.063
O-On the phone.

40:25.233 --> 40:28.648
Talk into the phone.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.573
Say… Say-Say hi.

40:30.770 --> 40:33.388
Matthew? Hey, buddy.

40:33.586 --> 40:36.202
Hey, it's Daddy.
Did you go to school today?

40:36.242 --> 40:38.576
Did you have fun?

40:38.738 --> 40:41.128
Matthew?

40:41.298 --> 40:43.665
Um… you know,
I'm sorry.

40:43.827 --> 40:47.275
Uh, h-he was talking
just a second ago.

40:47.475 --> 40:50.891
–It's okay. Thanks for trying.
–Okay.

40:51.059 --> 40:53.645
–I'm sorry.
–No, no, no. It's okay.

40:53.844 --> 40:55.632
Thanks.
I'll see you.

40:58.388 --> 41:00.112
Your dog or your kid?

41:00.308 --> 41:02.697
Kid. One of three.

41:02.868 --> 41:05.323
I'm more a dog person.

41:05.492 --> 41:07.216
Wife?

41:07.412 --> 41:09.616
Separated.

41:29.591 --> 41:32.940
–Wait. Wait.
–What's wrong?

41:33.111 --> 41:35.348
What's that smell?

41:46.136 --> 41:48.624
