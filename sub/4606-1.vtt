- That same nightmare again, huh?

02:01.538 --> 02:04.624
We were stuck here in Africa,
and we were all super-old and wrinkly...

02:04.792 --> 02:07.251
Well, I aged well,
but the rest of you looked terrible!

04:27.142 --> 04:29.894
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.605
I love this.
But it's not the real thing.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.358
That's because it's a mud model, Alex.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.110
It's not actually New York.
I hope that was clear.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.528
What are we doing?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.531
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.202
But... we should just go to Monte Carlo
and get them.

04:46.370 --> 04:51.082
How do a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a
hippo walk into a casino in Monte Carlo?

04:51.249 --> 04:54.335
- I don't know. Ask the rabbi!
- Hey, I'm serious.

We can do anything! It's us!

04:58.590 --> 05:00.925
Yeah, that's right.
We've gone halfway around the world!

05:01.093 --> 05:04.929
Compared with that, Monte Carlo's
just a hop, skip and a swim away!

No! I just came by to say
that I don't want you to think...

34:42.330 --> 34:46.167
I don't want you to think of me

- Not at all.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.841

might find me a bit intimidating.

45:33.272 --> 45:36.650
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.

45:36.818 --> 45:38.527
So when he lost his passion,

45:38.694 --> 45:41.780
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.450
- This is why we need your help.
- What sort of help?

45:45.618 --> 45:49.579
You can teach us to do new circus.
<i>Americano</i> style!

45:49.747 --> 45:51.039
We find a new passion.

45:51.207 --> 45:56.128
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!

46:04.137 --> 46:07.764

46:07.932 --> 46:09.808
We are a lost cause.

46:11.978 --> 46:14.688
No, no, this isn't <i>stupido.</i>
This could work!

46:15.773 --> 46:17.566
- What?
- What you just said.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.777
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font> What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.904
- What?
- Your <i>stupido</i> idea!

46:23.072 --> 46:25.949
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

46:26.117 --> 46:29.244
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

46:29.412 --> 46:32.956
Some say I'm even slightly below.

46:33.124 --> 46:36.543
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

46:36.711 --> 46:41.214
I call it Phase 4-7B,
wherein, in order to get home,

46:41.382 --> 46:45.510
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!

46:45.678 --> 46:48.930
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

46:49.098 --> 46:51.808
Something that'll blow

46:57.773 --> 47:00.192
Circus has been same for generations!

47:00.359 --> 47:02.360
We make good,

47:02.528 --> 47:05.197
Aha! But last few generations,

47:05.364 --> 47:08.533

<font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>

47:11.370 --> 47:13.705
That's right.
Families not so entertained

47:13.873 --> 47:16.416
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.502
It's missing passion.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.297
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

47:22.465 --> 47:26.092
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

47:27.053 --> 47:29.221
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

47:29.388 --> 47:32.182
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.934
But those days are over.

47:34.101 --> 47:37.145
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.940
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

47:40.107 --> 47:42.943
Circus is not about the acts you do.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.654
Circus is in here.

47:45.821 --> 47:48.073
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?

47:48.241 --> 47:52.827
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

47:52.995 --> 47:57.207
<font color="#D900D9">(scoffs)</font> You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

47:57.375 --> 48:01.545
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,

48:01.712 --> 48:04.756
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

48:04.924 --> 48:07.092
and completely flipped the paradigm.

48:07.260 --> 48:12.430
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.683
And one of them
completely in the nude.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.726
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.853
Take off their clothes?

48:20.273 --> 48:22.691
- No. They got rid of the animals.

I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

48:30.992 --> 48:36.830

the animals out of the circus!

- Yeah!
- Yes!

48:45.548 --> 48:46.548
Uh... No!

48:46.716 --> 48:49.968
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.845
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

48:52.013 --> 48:54.306
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

<font color="#D900D9">(cheering)</font>
<font color="#D900D9">(roaring)</font>

48:56.642 --> 48:59.352
We'll make an all-animal circus!

48:59.520 --> 49:02.772
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.066
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

49:05.234 --> 49:07.902
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

49:08.070 --> 49:11.740
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

49:11.991 --> 49:14.659
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

49:14.827 --> 49:17.662
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?

49:17.830 --> 49:19.414
Fur power!

49:19.582 --> 49:22.208
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

49:22.376 --> 49:24.919
You and me, baby! An act together!

49:25.087 --> 49:25.920
I love it!

49:26.088 --> 49:28.214

that funk and groove dance thing!

49:28.382 --> 49:30.425

Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

49:47.777 --> 49:51.946

and standing and rolling over.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.825

of sitting, standing, rolling over.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.286

I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

56:17.499 --> 56:19.042

we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:09.760

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.892

we were already home.

But what do we tell them?

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.919
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:44.920
