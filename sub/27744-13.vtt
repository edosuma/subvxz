Hot from the oven.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.244

Which came first, girls?

[egg splatters]

01:22.999 --> 01:23.917
Oh.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.095
Do I look okay?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.430
I haven't seen
most of these people in years.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.265
You look like a million bucks.

01:39.516 --> 01:43.019
[chuckles] That's great,
because I only paid 42,500 for that face.

01:43.103 --> 01:43.937
[laughs]

01:48.358 --> 01:51.528
Am I having another stroke
or did I burn my toast?

01:51.611 --> 01:54.572
You actually burned the Vitamix,
which... how?

01:54.781 --> 01:57.200
But, no worries, it's fine.

01:57.283 --> 02:01.037
Frankie, there was a chicken
in my sock drawer.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.082
I wondered where Lindsay got to.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.334
I thought we talked
about chickens in the house.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.920
Yeah, where did we land on that?

02:09.003 --> 02:11.089
We landed on no chickens in the house.

02:11.172 --> 02:15.677
You know, the chickens have been
a great comfort for Frankie.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.594
Hmm.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.557
Especially since you won't let me
tuck her in anymore.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.521
[snickers]

02:29.357 --> 02:32.902
Stop worrying. The party's gonna be great.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.070
Which part?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.073
Surprising my emotionally
volatile daughter,

02:37.157 --> 02:40.952
or me being back in a room with a woman
who tried to throw a printer at me?

02:41.035 --> 02:42.495
That was "Mediation Grace."

02:42.579 --> 02:44.414
I'm sure she's mellowed since then.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.124
That's easy for you to say,

02:46.624 --> 02:49.294
Frankie made you a mediation mix-tape.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.337
I'm already on this, fellas.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.882
I've got a plan to deal with Grace.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.759
What makes you think she'll listen to you?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.761
I'm an emotional wizard.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.432
I made Robert my bestie, didn't I?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.103
I'm gonna go hide the printer.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.028
-Want some jam?
-Okay.

03:16.279 --> 03:20.533
How am I supposed to be around Robert
without my hands going for his throat?

03:20.617 --> 03:23.828
My ex-wife choked me. We're fine now.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.456
Why are we celebrating Brianna's 40th?

03:27.373 --> 03:30.335

03:50.438 --> 03:52.273
Great. I'm molting.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.109
There's a lint roller downstairs.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.861
Help me find my party cardigan.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.238
-It's in the closet...
-Oh.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.155
...at our new house.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.282
-Robert!
-Solbert!

04:01.366 --> 04:05.828
I asked you to stop taking things
over there until I had a chance...

04:06.704 --> 04:08.831
to tell Frankie that we're moving out.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.793
And I asked you to tell Frankie
we were moving three months ago

04:11.876 --> 04:13.086
when we bought our new house.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.630
I'm trying to find the right way
to break it to her.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.382
Well, the movers are coming on Tuesday,

04:17.465 --> 04:21.386
so if you don't, someone
from Fenster Brothers Pack 'N Carry will.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.765
They were very nice on the phone,
maybe they can break it to her.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.476
Good God, I think the biggest chicken
in this house is you.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.144
Chickens are famously brave!

04:30.228 --> 04:32.939
Frankie was only supposed
to stay here for a few weeks.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.192
And as much as I enjoy the smell
of ethnic food at two in the morning,

04:36.276 --> 04:39.487
I am left to wonder why there is
no ethnic food to go with it.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.490
I just don't think
she can make it here alone.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.576
So whatever happened
to asking Bud or Coyote to move in?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.997
I don't know. I feel bad.
They have lives of their own.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.500
And we're supposed to have
lives of our own, too.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.004
I know. You're right.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.424
I'll talk to them today.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.508
Thank you.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.137
And I'm sorry I packed
your party cardigan.

05:04.220 --> 05:08.141
It's okay. It's out of batteries anyway.
You threw it away, didn't you?

05:08.224 --> 05:09.350
I did. Yes.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.239
-[Jack] Why didn't you want this house?
-Oh, I did.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.075
The day after Robert came out,
I came out here.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.996
But I saw Frankie's car,
and I turned around and never looked back.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
I drove straight to Palm Desert.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.501
And I'm glad I did,
because... that's when I met you.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.421
I would have gone with the house.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.096
Oh, it's you.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.681
Grace?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.643
Sure, come right in.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.104
Oh, this is my husband, Jack.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.731
Jack, this is Frankie.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.900
I'm sure I've mentioned her
briefly in passing.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.652
-Consider me flattered.
-Jack Patterson.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.365
You'll have to do most
of the work here, pal. Big stroke.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.657
You had a stroke?

06:06.741 --> 06:08.326
Oh, I've had three.

06:08.409 --> 06:12.497
But don't worry, there won't be a fourth.
I'm on a strict regimen of sound baths,

06:12.580 --> 06:14.957
blood-thinning crystals,
and Sol's foot rubs.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.503
I'm sure you recognize my husband
from his commercials.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.712
[Frankie] Oh, I do!

06:19.796 --> 06:23.299
It is an honor to meet you,
new Mr. Coffee.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.385
-[Frankie laughs]
-So, where is everyone?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.804
The party doesn't start
for an hour and a half.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.806
Then why did you tell us to be here now?

06:29.889 --> 06:34.060
I thought you and I could use this time
to have a sharing circle.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.397
A sharing circle?
Well, all right, I'll go first.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.981
I don't share.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.110
I also don't share. You got a TV?

06:42.610 --> 06:43.820
Over there, pal.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.908
Today is about Brianna,

06:49.325 --> 06:52.954
and everyone is worried there's going
to be a whole thing when you see Robert.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.374
Why? I'm fabulous.
Have you looked at me?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.835
I'm still trying to find you in there.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.336
I'm happy, Frankie.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.674
And once this has settled,
my face will reflect that.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.135
But you ran off
and got married too quickly.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.138
You couldn't possibly
have processed your anger.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.975
Frankie, I released all my anger
the night of the seafood tower.

07:14.058 --> 07:19.147
You got over 20 years of betrayal
by pelting Robert with crab legs?

07:19.230 --> 07:23.025
-Yes. You should try it sometime.
-I don't need to resort to violence.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.446
Living here is proof
that I've crossed the valley of pain

07:26.529 --> 07:28.281
into the other side of healing.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.824
You still live here?

07:30.491 --> 07:32.326
You're kidding me.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.744
It's been three years!

07:33.828 --> 07:35.872
A great three years.

07:35.955 --> 07:40.376
Oh, and don't get me started
on all the fun this crazy crew has.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.921
Do you really get along with Robert?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.132
Oh, now that he's gay, he's awesome.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.635
Well, Jack is...
[whispers] a dream.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.472
We went to Spain last year.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.141
And we had sangria every night

07:55.224 --> 07:59.103
along with very satisfying
heterosexual intercourse.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.939
Both positions.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.441
[scoffs]

08:05.067 --> 08:06.068

08:17.413 --> 08:18.456
Hi.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.582
Wow.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.000
You came.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.211
Lovely to see you, too, honey.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
[indistinct voice on the radio]

08:27.840 --> 08:29.634
-Hello, Jack.
-I'm good.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.345
Is that supposed to be dinner
for everyone?

08:32.428 --> 08:34.096
These are the centerpieces.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.181
Oh.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.601
So, you're back
in the party-planning game, are you?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.354
Yeah, well, with Mitch
being away so much...

08:41.812 --> 08:43.064
How is Mitch?

08:43.147 --> 08:44.440
Oh, he's good.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
Still married to Mallory.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.902
I got this one, Frankie.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.738
He's good. He's still married to me.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.157
He's doing Doctors Without Borders
for a few months,

08:53.241 --> 08:55.368
so that's... [chuckles]
good.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.662
It's good for us. We're good.

08:57.995 --> 09:01.457
Taking time away from a spouse
can be a very healing thing.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.002
How do you know? You're divorced
and you're still attached at the hip.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.171
Only for potato-sack races.

09:08.422 --> 09:12.260

Sol! I got a great idea for Field Day!

09:12.343 --> 09:13.177

09:20.977 --> 09:23.563
Hello... Grace.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.315
[stammers] Hello... Robert.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.526
[stammering] You're looking well.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.653
Thank you. Jack!

09:32.530 --> 09:35.616
I'm doing well. And you? Jack!

09:37.827 --> 09:39.161
You know what? Let's go to Jack!

09:44.250 --> 09:47.503
Jack. Jack, this is Robert.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.755
Jack Patterson.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.550
It's an honor to meet
"The Patio Prince of the Desert!"

09:52.633 --> 09:57.263
I was supposed to be Patio King,
but... Larry Schuman beat me to it.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.473
-[exhales]
-Yes, Jack has achieved great success

09:59.557 --> 10:02.518
in the cut-throat world
of patio furniture.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.605
You think he's ever gonna make it
back to what he was?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.565
Oh, God, I hope so.

10:07.648 --> 10:12.361
Say, you know I have a golf net out there
and a mid-mashie with your name on it.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.864
Well, I'm gonna check that out.
[laughs]

10:19.702 --> 10:21.829
-[sighs]
-Jack is fantastic.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.332
Yes, and romantic. Oh.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.959
He puts a sweet note in my car every day.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.127
That sounds lovely.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.880
Oh, it is literally
the definition of lovely.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.591
It's literally not
the definition of that--

10:33.674 --> 10:35.676
Robert, don't make this about you.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.261
Let's enjoy our daughter's party.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.096
My intention today

10:39.180 --> 10:41.182
-is not to get an apology--
-Of course not.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.352
Or show you how badly
you've misjudged me.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.021
Or make you question your ability
to even love at all.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.524
-Grace, I just want--
-Hush, Robert. We can't have a scene.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.612
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.030
What for?

10:56.113 --> 10:59.992
All the guilt I felt
over what I did to you has been lifted.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.703
Seeing you and Jack so happy

11:02.787 --> 11:05.998
has literally given me a relief
I never thought I'd have.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.751
That's not how you use literally!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.092
Hey, boys...

11:17.051 --> 11:18.886
-how you doing?
-[Bud] Oh.

11:18.969 --> 11:22.264
Pretty great, actually.
I just got my 60-day chip.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.309
Congrats, two months sober,
that's solid footing.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.187
-And how about you, Rabbi?
-Not a rabbi yet.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.523
-I still have one more year--
-But considering everything,

11:30.606 --> 11:32.733
it sounds like you're both doing great,
which is good,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.360
because I have something to ask you.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.654
-Oh, should we towel off?
-[Sol] Nope! Nope!

11:36.737 --> 11:39.115
Nobody move. I have some news.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.659
Robert and I have bought a house.

11:41.742 --> 11:42.785
-Congratulations.
-That's great!

11:42.868 --> 11:44.829
Nope. Nope, not where this is going.

11:44.912 --> 11:49.875
[sighs] You know, back in third grade
when everyone had to take turns

11:49.959 --> 11:52.002
taking care of the class hamster,

11:52.086 --> 11:55.673
because if they didn't, it would have
another stroke or fall down the stairs?

11:55.756 --> 11:57.675
[chuckles] I'm not following.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.261
Dr. Squeaks Medicine Woman
was famously nimble on the stairs.

12:00.344 --> 12:05.516
It has been three years of your mother
living with me and my husband,

12:05.599 --> 12:09.687
and we can't do it anymore,
not if I wanna stay married.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.147
How does Mom feel about this?

12:12.648 --> 12:13.524
She doesn't know.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.444
But once you decide
who's moving in with her,

12:16.527 --> 12:18.446
we can present the whole package.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.990
We're going to bring her solutions,
not problems.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.742
Thanks, boys.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.660
No pressure.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.789
Just try to get me an answer
before the end of the party.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.627
Oh, my God...

12:34.962 --> 12:36.422
Mom's the hamster.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.969
[Frankie] What are you doing?

12:42.052 --> 12:45.931
Well, apparently, I've relieved Robert
of all his guilt by coming here today,

12:46.307 --> 12:50.060
so I'm relieving him of the Baccarat
candy dish he loves so much.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.062
See, this is what I'm worried about.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.274
You didn't deal with your anger,
now your anger's dealing with you.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.276
Does he love these cheese knives?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.780
His cholesterol level is Havarti,
so what do you think?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.490
Hey, put those back!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.742
You wanted me to process?
This is me processing.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.871
Perhaps what you are really
trying to take is all that you've lost.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.457
Oh, sure. Where are
the starfish napkin rings?

13:11.540 --> 13:14.835
More importantly,
where are the SpongeBob coasters

13:14.919 --> 13:17.421
I bought Robert for Hanukkah?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.380
[gasps]

13:18.464 --> 13:20.007
My samovar!

13:20.090 --> 13:21.967
Oh, that's actually mine.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.970
-It is not.
-Babe left it to me when she died.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.932
-Babe left it to me when she died.
-[Sol] Hey, girls.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.894
-Sol, where are the starfish napkin rings?
-Yeah, where are they?

13:32.353 --> 13:33.312
Uh...

13:33.395 --> 13:37.233
I think you put them in your studio...
the night of our luau.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.193
Huh, I don't remember that.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.488
But I also don't remember the luau,
so you could be right.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.367
You need to stop looking for things!

13:46.450 --> 13:48.327
Well, excuse me. Why?

13:48.410 --> 13:50.913
Because a lot of things aren't here

13:50.996 --> 13:54.083
and... Frankie can't find that out
right now.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
I'm afraid to ask.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.461
We're moving into a new house,

13:57.545 --> 13:58.838
but Frankie doesn't know

13:58.921 --> 14:01.674
and Robert's been slowly
moving things out.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.844
You two are unbelievable.
You are still lying to her!

14:05.135 --> 14:06.846
This is the only lie.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.389
Was there a luau?

14:10.015 --> 14:10.850
Two lies.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.528
Better leave it off.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.447
I'm Mallory, and you are?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.741
I'm Barry. I'm the accountant.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.119
Hi, Barry the accountant.
Where's everyone else?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.705
I invited the whole office
and she's gonna be here any minute.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.167
Maybe the e-vite
went to their spam folders.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.670
Okay, but you clearly
got the e-mail, so...

14:40.504 --> 14:43.048
-I have very loose spam filters.
-Okay.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.350
Surprise!

14:54.768 --> 14:56.228
Are you surprised?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.938
Yeah, can I talk to you outside
for a second?

14:58.022 --> 14:58.856
[chuckles]

14:58.939 --> 15:02.109
Why are you saying that
like you're going to murder me?

15:06.405 --> 15:10.117
I thought this was just supposed to be
you and me getting high!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.119
That was just a trick, idiot!

15:12.202 --> 15:14.914
You could have at least told me
to wear a bra!

15:14.997 --> 15:17.583
Why? Now we're twinsies.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.256
[sighs]

15:27.176 --> 15:29.136
Is there a chance
Brianna would wanna take Mom?

15:32.014 --> 15:35.017
Yeah, she's in a great mood.
Let's ask her.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.603
It's unfair that Dad asked you,
since you're just out of rehab.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.147
And Mom's penchant
for reggaeton and late-night nachos

15:40.230 --> 15:42.566
aren't exactly conducive
to rabbinical study.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.985
So, I guess it's you.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.324
Me relapsing again versus you buying
some noise-canceling headphones?

15:50.407 --> 15:53.327
Okay, neither one of us
is in an ideal place to take care of her.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.537
Me less so than you, but totally agree.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.622
[water splashing]

15:56.705 --> 16:00.292
So... who's gonna tell Dad?

16:00.834 --> 16:01.961
[groans quietly]

16:02.586 --> 16:03.420
Exactly.

16:09.009 --> 16:09.969
-[Mallory gasps]
-Hi, Mallory!

16:10.052 --> 16:11.929
God, you scared me.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.514
Really, that was scary?

16:13.597 --> 16:16.767
Because our mother is here
wearing Carly Simon's mouth.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.186
It's your 40th birthday.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.480
I couldn't not invite Mom.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.107
But you brought my accountant?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.734
What, were my mammographer
and the shoe guy at Saks

16:25.818 --> 16:27.653
who said I had toaster feet unavailable?

16:28.028 --> 16:30.280
Actually, I invited your whole office.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.032
Jesus, Mallory!

16:32.658 --> 16:36.912
Who would want any of those duds
and sexual lepers at my party?

16:38.247 --> 16:40.916
And why aren't those duds
and sexual lepers at my party?

16:41.291 --> 16:44.545
I'm told it has something to do
with spam filters, so--

16:44.628 --> 16:46.338
Hey, Brianna, quick question.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.298
Happy birthday, by the way. Um...

16:49.299 --> 16:51.093
Do you want to live with my mom?

16:52.302 --> 16:55.597
-Five, four, three--
-Yep, totally understand.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.894
-[chicken clucking]
-Um...

17:01.520 --> 17:04.857
-We're not having poultry, are we?
-Why, would that be awkward?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.443
Just because they're staring at us
and we can hear them clucking?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.028
No chicken tonight.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.529
As a party planner must,

17:10.612 --> 17:13.407
I anticipated
the discomfort one might feel

17:13.490 --> 17:16.035
from eating something
that is also a guest at the party.

17:16.118 --> 17:20.164
Well, your goldfish guests are extra dead.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.915
[whispers] No!

17:21.999 --> 17:24.626
No, I just got these today!

17:24.710 --> 17:27.379
They've gone to a better place,
not this party.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.131
[Mallory] No worries. No worries.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.718
I'm just gonna bring out
the spectacular thing that I had planned.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.263
I was going to build to it,
but let's just skip the foreplay,

17:36.346 --> 17:38.932
move right to the orgasm,
and send everyone on their way!

17:39.016 --> 17:41.727
That's the first thing about this party
that reflects who I am.

17:42.061 --> 17:42.936
Good.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.568
No sign of the napkin holders,
but at least now I remember the luau.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.111
Oh, God.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.824
What in God's name are you drinking?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.702
Ah, it's a Brianndy.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.914
It's "Brianna" and "brandy."
[inhales]

18:01.997 --> 18:05.709
Your sister said it was your signature,
uh, birthday cocktail, so...

18:05.793 --> 18:08.504
At this point my signature cocktail
should be whatever John Belushi shot up

18:08.587 --> 18:09.671
at The Chateau Marmont.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.798
[chuckles]

18:11.507 --> 18:13.467
Robert likes corn...

18:13.842 --> 18:18.680
Hey, sticky mitts, you don't just take
someone's corn-cob holders.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.267
A family lives here
and we're about to eat corn.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.020
Fine. You keep it. I'll take the samovar.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.942
No. I'm keeping the samovar,
and you can have the damn corn holders.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.569
Sol cuts my corn for me anyway.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.240
Can I ask you something? I need you
to be honest. Can you do that for me?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.407
Unfortunately.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.410
Why are you the only one here from work?
Do they all hate me or something?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.663
[chuckles nervously]

18:43.122 --> 18:44.623
I wouldn't say "hate".

18:44.706 --> 18:47.167
-Like?
-You're putting me in a real spot here.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.086
I am a fun boss.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.588
And I'm always shootin' the shit
with the gang.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.758
Maybe the gang...

18:54.842 --> 18:57.261
didn't come to your party
out of respect for your wishes.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.847
You did tell us you didn't want
to celebrate your birthday.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.099
Wanna be mad at someone,
be mad at me for showing up.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.643
Well, I'm not thrilled with you.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.480
And if I'm such a monster,
why are you here?

19:10.190 --> 19:14.653
I guess I just always thought
you were a funny, smart person who...

19:15.737 --> 19:17.239
didn't let her guard down very often.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.910
And no one should be alone
on their birthday, even monsters.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.415
And... teenage boys who aren't weird

19:26.498 --> 19:30.002
just because they're fascinated
by the Lincoln Assassination because...

19:31.461 --> 19:32.880
it's fascinating.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
You know something?
You're actually a pretty good guy.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.302
I'm glad you finally noticed.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.185
-What are you doing?
-I'm texting my ex.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.604
Like you said,
no one should be alone on their birthday.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.571
You know, Frankie isn't the only one
that's having a problem with her hand.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.740
This hand gets so tired

19:59.823 --> 20:04.161
lugging around this gigantic
engagement ring that Jack gave me.

20:04.786 --> 20:08.498
Yes, I sold everything you gave me
on "I-Do-Now-I-Don't-dot-com."

20:08.582 --> 20:12.544
It's where everyone gets rid of all
the jewelry they got during their marriage

20:12.628 --> 20:14.504
that now fills them with rage.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.177
You know, you say to me,
"Jack, teak is 2002,

20:20.260 --> 20:23.096
aluminum is too hot,
and wicker is for baskets."

20:25.891 --> 20:27.226
I just sat down.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.895
And I say to you two words:

20:30.854 --> 20:32.773
indoor, outdoor.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.067
[Jack chuckles]

20:35.567 --> 20:39.154
Do you think the goldfish talked to Jack
and thought, "What's the point?"

20:39.238 --> 20:41.698
So, Jack... Spain, huh?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.992
Tell us about your trip with Grace.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.162
-We didn't go to Spain.
-Well, not yet.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.666
Thanks a lot, Frankie,
for spoiling that surprise.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.918
We're not really great
traveling companions.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.504
We almost killed each other
on the drive here. [chuckles]

20:55.587 --> 20:58.173
But Grace clearly said
that you went there.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.467
Well, Jack never remembers anything.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.719
Spain? He doesn't remember Spain?

21:03.220 --> 21:05.639
What about that sangria
and all that heterosexual--

21:05.722 --> 21:08.016
Where the hell
are the starfish napkin rings?

21:08.600 --> 21:12.062
I mean, napkin rings don't just get up
and move away without telling you,

21:12.145 --> 21:13.772
-do they, Robert?
-Grace...

21:13.855 --> 21:17.442
No, Robert, you don't get to say "Grace"
like that anymore,

21:17.526 --> 21:20.153
just to shut me up
and make your life easier.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.823
How do you feel about
making my life easier?

21:22.906 --> 21:26.159
Well, how do you feel about
being stabbed with a corn holder?

21:26.243 --> 21:30.497
I'm sorry, everyone. Grace has not done
the hard work of moving on,

21:30.580 --> 21:33.792
so she's still clearly
dealing with her rage.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.836
Well, at least I'm dealing
with a full deck.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.172
You're delusional, Frankie.
They're doing it to you again.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.550
Don't try to break up our happy family

21:41.633 --> 21:45.095
just because you're stuck with
some dullard who's never been to Spain.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.139
Well, at least this very dull man,

21:47.222 --> 21:49.641
who never leaves
his beautifully furnished deck,

21:49.725 --> 21:52.644
isn't secretly moving
into a new house without me.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.147
What are you talking about?

21:55.939 --> 21:59.359
Robert and Sol bought a house.
They're moving in on Tuesday.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.403
Is that true?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.489
No. Wednesday at the earliest.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.783
When were you going to tell me about this?

22:06.867 --> 22:11.580
Well, today, actually, because we wanted
to surprise you with the good news.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.499
One of the boys
is going to move in with you.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.667
-Actually, Dad--
-Uh...

22:15.751 --> 22:18.337
Oh, great.
Now you're trying to pass me off on them?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.172
I can't believe it!

22:20.255 --> 22:22.674
This cannot be happening to me again!

22:23.425 --> 22:25.344
Ta-da!

22:25.427 --> 22:28.347
It isn't a party
until there's a seafood tower!

22:29.681 --> 22:30.515
[Grace gasps]

22:31.767 --> 22:33.643
-[Sol gasps]
-[Bud] Uh-oh.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.981
How long have you known this time, Sol?

22:38.398 --> 22:41.234
When did you start looking
for a new house?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.569
Um... let me think...

22:42.652 --> 22:44.321
The day you moved in.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.531
I moved in three years ago!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.075
[all groaning]

22:48.742 --> 22:50.369
Ow! Frankie! Ah!

22:50.452 --> 22:52.621
Somehow I knew we'd end up here.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.373
Jack, let's go.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.709
Happy Birthday, Brianna.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.880
I'll just leave them a card.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.758
I mean, their new house,
they must have a patio.

23:04.841 --> 23:05.884
Jack!

23:06.885 --> 23:10.722
-Ah, drop it!
-I think I'll go, uh, cool off the car.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.101
I'm just taking what's mine
and getting the hell out of here.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.394
That is not yours!

23:15.477 --> 23:16.895
Yes, it is.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.232
Babe sent me a letter before she died
saying she wanted me to have it.

23:20.315 --> 23:24.736
Bullshit. She sent me a letter
saying she wanted me to have it!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.863
Bullshit. Just like your life.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.949
Just like your face!

23:29.032 --> 23:31.576
-It hasn't settled yet!
-[Frankie sighs]

23:31.660 --> 23:32.911
[Frankie] Oh, no. No, no!

23:32.994 --> 23:36.248
You don't get to ruin a party
and then walk away with party favors!

23:36.331 --> 23:39.251
I didn't ruin anything.
You did this to yourself.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.460
Oh, really? I did this?

23:40.544 --> 23:42.212
All your processing. [chuckles]

23:42.295 --> 23:45.632
And you managed to end up
right back where you were, but worse.

23:45.715 --> 23:49.261
Oh, and you went from a loveless marriage
to, oh, a loveless marriage.

23:49.344 --> 23:52.597
-That's showin' 'em.
-At least I didn't get stuck in this shit.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.558
How could you have? You ran away.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.853
You think your hand is paralyzed,
you should take a look at your life!

23:57.936 --> 24:00.897
Oh, take a look at yours, Patio Princess!

24:01.231 --> 24:04.526
Every person in that house
was dreading your arrival today.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.780
Well, then they won't mind if I leave.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.782
Oh, you can go, but she's staying.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.286
Who's she?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.329
Babe. She's in the samovar.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.457
It's her new house.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.670
You're telling me
I'm holding my best friend's ashes?

24:23.753 --> 24:26.882
No. You're holding my best friend's ashes.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.468
Well, why the hell didn't you tell me?

24:29.551 --> 24:33.138
When was I supposed to tell you,
when you didn't show up for her funeral?

24:35.974 --> 24:37.684
Well, I wanted to come.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.104
I knew Robert was...

24:42.189 --> 24:44.983
was gonna be there and I just--
I couldn't deal.

24:45.066 --> 24:48.945
Well, you missed a real banger.
The police had to break it up.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.155
I bet.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.948
[sighs]

24:54.784 --> 24:57.120
Why do you think she promised this
to both of us?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.122
I don't know.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.709
She always said
that I should give you a chance.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.003
She told me that, too.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.759
[car honking]

25:10.842 --> 25:13.094
-Well, I guess I should--
-Yeah, me, too.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.513
[clears throat]

25:15.555 --> 25:18.767
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm gonna stay here by myself.

25:19.726 --> 25:23.855
Oh, who am I kidding? I'll probably end up
in a retirement village.

25:28.443 --> 25:29.277
You keep her.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.904
Are you sure?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.658
Well, for now.
I'll come back and get her sometime.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.869
Will you?

26:13.446 --> 26:14.573
Frankie!

26:15.240 --> 26:16.533
Frankie!

26:16.616 --> 26:18.535
Grace! Grace!

26:18.994 --> 26:20.036
Ah.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.121
Oh.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.331
Stay there! I'll come to you!

26:23.915 --> 26:25.667
[Grace]
Oh, good. [gasps]

26:25.917 --> 26:28.086
[panting]

26:28.169 --> 26:29.337
We need to talk.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.965
You first. No, wait! I'll go first.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.218
I've been doing a lot of thinking
and I wasn't even high.

26:35.302 --> 26:38.388
Me, too. I was a little drunk,
but I think better that way.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.806
Oh, Grace,

26:40.390 --> 26:43.059
I'm sorry about the things I said.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.604
I said terrible things, too, Frankie.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.148
I'm so much better because of you.

26:48.231 --> 26:51.693
Me, too! And not only because
we went through hell together.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.861
No, because...

26:53.653 --> 26:55.447
because we made it back together.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.906
[both chuckle]

26:57.490 --> 27:01.578
You're my best friend and my partner,
and I-- I need you.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.497
Oh, I need you, too.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.124
Ah.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.960
Oh. So, let's go home.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.170
[Frankie chuckles]

27:10.253 --> 27:12.589
Yeah. [clears throat]
There's just one thing.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.673
Um...

27:14.883 --> 27:16.593
I married Nick last night.
