(female narrator)
Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars, The Perfectionists.."

00:02.669 --> 00:05.255
I know what you did.
I know you cheated on mom.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.883
I'm sorry, alright?
I-I, I was stupid.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.092
I know what Nolan was like.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.094
'He just wanted to prove
that he could do it.'

00:11.094 --> 00:13.472
(Dylan)
What can I do to fix this?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.973
(Andrew)
You've done enough.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.143
Andrew.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.770
You really don't know who I am,
do you?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.355
Your dad stole
my parents' life savings.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.941
Hiding in the shadows
makes you an easy target.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.068
'Until you come back,
you won't be safe.'

00:26.068 --> 00:27.110
[beeps]

00:27.110 --> 00:29.947
Bet you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.157
How the hell did you know
about Jeremy?

00:32.157 --> 00:34.117
And everything else you had
on my friends?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.827
I was Nolan's insurance policy.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.412
(Dylan)
Maybe the person
who's doing this to us

00:37.412 --> 00:39.164
didn't kill Nolan,
maybe they think that we did.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.791
(Ava)
And Dana's been using
our secrets

00:40.791 --> 00:43.085
to drive a wedge between us.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.338
How could Nolan Hotchkiss
be at my apartment?

00:46.338 --> 00:48.048

'So you were born like this.'

02:18.013 --> 02:20.474
Pre-school spelling competition,
first place.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.726
I didn't even know
how to spell mom in pre-school.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.852
You guys don't even know
the half of it.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.604
My mom's taught me
how to play Monopoly

02:25.604 --> 02:26.730
with a calculator.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.023
Where is your mom?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.566
I wanna tell her
that I voted for her

02:29.566 --> 02:31.318
during the midterms.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.195
She already flew back to DC.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.655
Civic duty never sleeps. Mm..

02:35.655 --> 02:37.074
Are you okay with that?

02:37.074 --> 02:38.867
I know what it's like
to be on your own.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.951
Honestly, it's fine.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.703
I have to prep
for my interview today.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.955
And besides, it's Dead Week.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.374
I'm already so behind on my work
even though

02:45.374 --> 02:46.541
I got some extensions.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.836
Because you got hit by a car.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.588
Caitlin, you really should
take it easy.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.799
If you guys were me,
would you be taking it easy?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.135
I thought so.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.179
They called off classes
for a reason.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.972
I have four midterms

03:00.972 --> 03:03.141
turning in an art history
project to two papers

03:03.141 --> 03:05.685
and I'm lighting candles
so I hear back from both.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.978
'Four midterms,
two on the same day'

03:06.978 --> 03:09.731
three essays
and a musical recording project.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.109
And you're lighting
an extra candle

03:12.109 --> 03:14.152
until I hear back
from the Seattle Symphony.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.904
Damn, when I say it out loud,
it does sound like a lot.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.155
Don't forget to add
we're being stalked

03:17.155 --> 03:18.532
and tortured by Dana Booker.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.951
Who we think
hit Caitlin with a car.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.537
We cannot let Dana
distract us this week.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.163
'We know that she wants
to divide and conquer'

03:25.163 --> 03:27.582
so we win by sticking together.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.959
It's not gonna be easy,
but we just

03:28.959 --> 03:30.919
have to keep our heads down
and get our work done.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.463
We'll focus on Dana
after Dead Week, deal?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.632
Deal.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.801
Smack me if you hear me say
Dana's name.

03:39.428 --> 03:40.762
What do I do about that?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.139
Do you really think I'd be here

03:42.139 --> 03:44.266
if we needed to be afraid of it?

03:44.266 --> 03:47.477
The box is a smart monitor,
it knows when you're home

03:47.477 --> 03:48.937
when you open
your doors and windows

03:48.937 --> 03:50.522
it can sense fires and floods.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.567
It'll send you a notification if
there's an on-campus emergency.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.402
And it's a kickass Wi-Fi router.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.155
I just wanna make sure that
you're gonna be okay and safe

03:58.155 --> 04:00.198
when I'm gone,
which is gonna be a lot

04:00.198 --> 04:01.533
because it's Dead Week.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.161
One thing I did not miss at BHU.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.954
I knew it was gonna be
stressful for students

04:05.954 --> 04:08.665
but no one told me it was gonna
be stressful for faculty, too.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.418
Pro tip, wine helps.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.711
[chuckles]

04:14.754 --> 04:17.674
Thank you
for letting me crash here.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.926
My life is about to go viral

04:19.926 --> 04:22.345
once my mom
makes her public statement.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.347
What is Claire gonna
tell the media?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.766
Exactly what I told her.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.310
That I couldn't handle
the pressure here.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.438
Ironic, considering
I came back during Dead Week.

04:31.438 --> 04:35.025
But I'm sure my mom already has
the BHU public relations office

04:35.025 --> 04:38.028
working overtime to spin-doctor
the unfortunate timing.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.154
Well,
Claire does have to protect

04:39.154 --> 04:41.323
the reputation of the school.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.492
I-I know
she's happy you're back.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.496
I think you're right

04:47.496 --> 04:50.040
but it will take time
for her to earn my trust.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.834
For now
you're the only one who knows

04:52.834 --> 04:55.128
why I really faked my death.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.048
When I disappeared,
I was afraid of my mom

04:58.048 --> 05:01.885
but you don't need to be afraid
of yours.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.596
I watched Claire mourn.
She was broken.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.181
She was getting drunk
in my living room

05:06.181 --> 05:07.307
to feel close to you.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.100
So dramatic.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.519
[cell phone ringing]

05:12.062 --> 05:14.981
[sighing]
Trying to schedule a FaceTime
with Grace and Lily

05:14.981 --> 05:17.817
is like the UN
trying to schedule a G7 summit.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.403
Don't be so hard on yourself.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.489
You're a working mom,
your kids will appreciate

05:22.489 --> 05:24.699
how hard
you've worked for them.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.162
I'm really glad that you
trusted me enough to come back.

05:29.162 --> 05:33.041
My brother trusted you.
That's enough for me.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.044
We do have a lot in common.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.298
You know, I have to admit
I was wrong about

05:40.298 --> 05:42.926
this 20th-century mystery
lit class being an easy A.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.053
- Why would you think that?
- 'I did, too.'

05:45.053 --> 05:48.181
But now we're analyzing
the issues of feminist identity

05:48.181 --> 05:50.100
in the works of Agatha Christie.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.227
Thank you.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.566
- You've got a big house.
- And class is really hard.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.152
I came here
to tell you something.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.071
The press is camped
outside the Hotchkiss estate

06:03.071 --> 06:04.739
waiting on
Claire's official statement

06:04.739 --> 06:08.118
but I wanted you
to hear it from me first.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.204
Taylor is alive.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.122
What?

06:13.748 --> 06:15.000
We were at her funeral.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.627
I know this is a lot to process

06:17.627 --> 06:20.130
but she faked her suicide.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.548
I grew up with Taylor.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.259
And-and she loved her family.
Why would she do this?

06:24.259 --> 06:27.137
And how could she do this
to them?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.806
Nolan was devastated
when she died.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.604
Nolan knew she was hiding
and he helped her.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.272
He knew?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.649
He was trying to keep you safe.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.276
Safe from what?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.154
Taylor told Claire
that she disappeared

06:44.154 --> 06:47.115
because she couldn't handle
the pressure.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.827
- But that's not the truth.
- Well, what is the truth?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.996
Someone tried to kill her.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.292
This stays between us.
Do you understand?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.964
Do you think the person
who tired to kill Taylor

07:02.964 --> 07:06.134
is the same person
who killed Nolan?

07:06.134 --> 07:09.137
Now that Taylor is back, I'm
hoping she can help us find out.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.267
There's something
that you need to know, Alison.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.227
We think it was Dana
who ran over Caitlin.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.937
(Mona)
You think it's Dana?

07:17.937 --> 07:20.357
Two days ago, you all were
100 percent convinced

07:20.357 --> 07:23.276
'that Mason killed Nolan
and hit Caitlin with the car.'

07:23.276 --> 07:26.154
But you were dead wrong,
pun intended.

07:26.154 --> 07:30.033
And full disclosure, someone
else is acting suspiciously.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.410
- Taylor.
- What's your issue with Taylor?

07:32.410 --> 07:35.955
[sighing]
Somebody left me a box
of cupcakes last night.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.791
And that's a problem?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.171
Want one?

07:44.756 --> 07:47.342
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.178
They used Nolan's ID card
to access my apartment.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.098
- How would you know that?
- Ah..

07:53.098 --> 07:54.265
I stole Taylor's RV.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
- I hid it in the woods.
- You what?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.352
It's like a mini Beacon Guard.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.688
Mona, I've seen the camper.
It's junk.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.273
Remember that underground
dollhouse I was trapped in?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.109
It looked like a bunker
from the outside.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.318
Okay, we have to Google
these guys.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.404
- Yeah.
- 'You won't find anything.'

08:07.404 --> 08:08.947
We were minors.
Those records are sealed.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.365
Where did you grow up?

08:10.365 --> 08:11.783
(both)
Rosewood, Pennsylvania.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.494
You remember when A made Hannah
eat all those cupcakes?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.163
Who's A?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.040
- A?
- It was a long time ago.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.126
'It was a game
that got out of hand.'

08:21.126 --> 08:24.254
We were kids. Dana's an adult.
She's not an A.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.296
I'm lost.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.757
Think of A as a bully
who makes a game

08:27.757 --> 08:29.217
out of watching you squirm.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.886
- You mean, like Dana?
- Dana's a total A.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.346
- 'But how do we prove it?'
- Great, guys.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.890
Just one more thing to add
to my to-do list for Dead Week.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.435
No, you three focus
on your studies.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.187
For now, the best cover you have
is for you to act normal.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.939
Well,
if you're giving us permission

08:42.939 --> 08:44.774
who are we to argue?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.610
And what's more normal than
studying our asses off, right?

08:47.610 --> 08:51.156
Exactly, I'll speak to Taylor
and if we can trust her

08:51.156 --> 08:53.158
then she'll help us
figure out who killed Nolan

08:53.158 --> 08:55.452
and we can hand that person over
to Dana on a silver platter.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.955
And I'm gonna find out
who left me those cupcakes.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.374
- I really hope it's not Dana.
- Why?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.501
Because she's on the inside.

09:03.501 --> 09:07.422
And I hope I'm wrong
about Taylor.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.965
And why is that?

09:08.965 --> 09:12.552
Because if it is Dana, then we
need somebody on the inside too.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.139
'And Taylor is a Hotchkiss.
How more inside can you get?'

09:20.185 --> 09:22.312
A puzzle is a new perspective
on how to unr--

09:22.312 --> 09:23.813
Save the grade-grubbing
goody two shoes

09:23.813 --> 09:24.981
act for class, please.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.399
Hey, I'm not the one
who paired us.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.277
- Forced!
- Together for this midterm.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.737
I just don't understand
how they expect us to figure out

09:30.737 --> 09:33.782
what painting this puzzle piece
is supposed to represent.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.075
What's so wrong
with multiple choice?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.077
Oh, now I have to get stuck
with creative professor.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.496
Our shrugs are broad,
they're loose

09:39.496 --> 09:41.956
kind of like
19th-century French realism.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.459
The painting like that
needs talent..

09:44.459 --> 09:46.044
Shit.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.087
Ah, it's-it's just art history.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.173
We've got four midterms,
a term paper

09:50.173 --> 09:51.716
this stupid puzzle piece
and a paper

09:51.716 --> 09:55.470
we're supposed to write about
it, don't tell me to relax.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.014
You know, let's just do
an online Internet search.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.516
I've coded search parameters
before.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.101
I can easily write a program,
scan this puzzle piece

10:02.101 --> 10:05.146
and we'll have so much more time
for our other classes.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.398
And best of all,
you won't have to see me.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.401
That's cheating.
Why am I surprised, though?

10:10.401 --> 10:14.364
Of course, you take the easy
way out...just like your dad.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.371
- I think I'm screwed.
- Aren't we all?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.623
Well, at least you're not
getting an incomplete grade.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.583
Oh, my God.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.585
- You are screwed.
- I know.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.671
I mean, I need more time
to record my solo piece

10:29.671 --> 10:32.090
as a midterm project for
my acoustical engineering class

10:32.090 --> 10:34.801
but Professor James says
he has to consider

10:34.801 --> 10:36.135
giving me an extension.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.595
Is this about your hand?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.138
It hurts to play.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.598
I didn't listen to the doctor
when he told me

10:40.598 --> 10:42.225
to take a break,
and I'm paying the price.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.352
Why don't you just tell
your professor?

10:44.352 --> 10:45.645
I'm sure he'll understand.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.980
If he finds out
that I can't play

10:46.980 --> 10:48.356
it could jeopardize
my scholarship.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.358
What do mean you can't play?

10:50.358 --> 10:53.111
It-it's not permanent, is it?

10:53.111 --> 10:54.571
I don't know yet.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.407
This is my fault.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.492
I never should have asked you
to play at my fashion show.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.162
This has nothing to do with you,
I overextended myself

11:03.162 --> 11:06.499
as always.
Bad habit I'm trying to kick.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.584
Hm.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.256
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.634
Did you, uh..

11:18.052 --> 11:20.013
Did you get my text?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.308
Yeah. Didn't make it.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.688
Congratulations,
I heard you rocked it.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.525
Thanks. Dylan rocked it.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.527
You should've seen him.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.281
Uh, well, I gotta go.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.700
Ancient Roman architecture
is calling my name.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.499
- He totally hates me.
- No.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.421
It's a fine line
between love and hate.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.468
He only hates you
because he loves you.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.600
Ending birth-right citizenship
with an executive order

12:05.600 --> 12:06.851
is unconstitutional,

12:06.851 --> 12:08.603
thanks to the 1898 case

12:08.603 --> 12:10.605
of the United States
versus Wong Kim Ark

12:10.605 --> 12:12.565
which established
an important precedent

12:12.565 --> 12:14.525
regarding the 14th Amendment.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.528
- Neck tie.
- This is so not fair.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.238
[scoffs]

12:19.238 --> 12:22.283
[laughing]
Well, you haven't
stumped me yet.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.661
And I'm so gonna ace
this internship interview.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.664
Mm-hmm,
you're as smart as a whip.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.249
Congressional puns make me hot.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.251
Now, look, you're one answer
away from winning

12:32.251 --> 12:34.087
then you're gonna keep
your promise, right?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.505
We're gonna talk about Taylor.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.383
I never met her, but I can't
believe she's alive.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.677
How could she do that
to her mother?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.179
I guess daughters
disappoint their mothers

12:43.179 --> 12:46.557
just like mothers disappoint
their daughters.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.017
I know it must be disappointing
to keep the secret

12:48.017 --> 12:49.602
from your other mom

12:49.602 --> 12:53.022
but you have to feel better
knowing it's off your chest.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.693
I don't feel better. I mean,
it's gonna come out. Dana knows.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.944
Broke your rule.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.071
- You said Dana.
- Damn her!

13:00.071 --> 13:02.073
[chuckles]

13:07.161 --> 13:08.538
What are you doing?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.415
Like you won't be able to answer

Don't wanna take off

What I want
is to buy you a cup of coffee

before all this happened.

I'm not gonna let

So I've reviewed all the keycard
entrances made by our fake Nolan

14:07.472 --> 14:09.432
but it's impossible
to get a visual

14:09.432 --> 14:11.893
on who's using Nolan's ID card.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.687
You know, I get
why we need to trust Taylor

14:14.687 --> 14:16.522
'but why do you wanna
trust her?'

14:16.522 --> 14:18.775
Because we share
the same crazy life experience.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.068
I mean, how often
does that happen with people

14:20.068 --> 14:22.737
like you and me?
I want her to be trustworthy.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.238
(Mona on phone)
'She's sneaking around
with her own'

14:24.238 --> 14:25.782
'private Beacon Guard, Ali.'

14:25.782 --> 14:27.950
You can't will someone
to be trustworthy.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.660
(Alison on phone)
'Okay, well, I'm gonna be home
in a few minutes.'

14:29.660 --> 14:31.662
Maybe she'll come clean
about the RV.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.832
Oh, that's interesting.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.668
'Ali, Taylor's got biometric
and physiological technology'

14:37.668 --> 14:39.378
and can track gait patterns.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.381
Okay, you need to slow down
with the computer geek jargon.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.926
G-A-I-T, gait.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.803
'That means
we can identify fake Nolan'

14:46.803 --> 14:48.805
'by matching
his or her walking pattern'

14:48.805 --> 14:50.640
but the search is gonna have
to scan through footage

14:50.640 --> 14:51.849
of the entire BHU population.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.935
Unfortunately,
that's gonna take some time.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.979
- 'Okay, keep me looped in.'
- Yeah.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.065
It makes sense if it was Dana.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.817
After all, she was FBI.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.860
And she has full access
to Beacon Guard.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.904
And that angle
that Caitlin was hit at..

15:04.904 --> 15:06.781
- Special-ops training.
- Really?

15:06.781 --> 15:09.742
Never played Call Of Duty?
And what about Taylor?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.369
She has access
to a Beacon Guard.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.829
Maybe Al was right,
you know, maybe she--

15:12.829 --> 15:14.539
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.916
But what part of
"Let's focus on our studies

15:16.916 --> 15:18.751

did you guys not get?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.295
[clears throat]

15:21.295 --> 15:24.215
Oh, no. Don't make eye contact.
Don't look her in the eye.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.883
It's like "Jurassic Park."
"Don't move."

15:25.883 --> 15:27.885
She can't see us
if we don't move.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.057
Just the three
I was looking for.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.059
- What do you want?
- To give you some good news.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.644
We solved your case.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.813
A teenager out for joyride
thought he hit a deer.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.774
He turned himself in when he
heard you were in the hospital.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.527
- Why wasn't this in the news?
- The driver was a minor.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.279
The case has been sealed
to the public.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.990
That's it?
The case is just closed?

15:48.990 --> 15:51.701
This sounds way too easy.

15:51.701 --> 15:55.371
Looks like you've been
studying together for hours.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.832
So you're real friends now.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.877
- Well, that's a game changer.
- We're not playing games.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.379
Oh, I think
you started the game.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.923
And it's my job to finish it.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.767
[bell tolling]

16:16.767 --> 16:18.895
I mean, how could someone
mistake me for a deer?

16:18.895 --> 16:21.689
- That story is so lame.
- 'That's what's so scary.'

16:21.689 --> 16:23.274
Dana thinks
she's getting away with it.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.650
You know what's even scarier?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.693
I don't think I wanna know.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.069
She thinks that we killed Nolan.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.821
'You realize you're breaking
your one rule, right?'

16:28.821 --> 16:31.407
- You're talking about Dana.
- 'You're right. You're right.'

16:31.407 --> 16:33.284
That was a slip. Sorry.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.997
Dylan, I-I-I gotta go, okay?
I gotta focus.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.751
- 'Caitlin, you've got this.'
- Thanks. Mm.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.129
Look, it's her.
We might as well leave now.

get in your head.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.659
Eventually, the media fades away
and you get your life back.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.913
How hard was it for you?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.750
I remember how isolating it was

17:22.750 --> 17:24.669
to be away
from my friends and family.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.963
I got used to the isolation.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.423
I'm gonna miss it now that the
news is finally out about me.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.426
- Well, you can't hide forever.
- I know.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.805
It's not the public scrutiny
that scares me.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.891
It's knowing that
I'll be a target again 24/7.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.772
What was it like for you
off the grid?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.983
How did you stay connected
out there in that van

17:46.983 --> 17:49.277
without Wi-Fi, not even a phone?

17:49.277 --> 17:50.903
It was liberating.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.906
Beacon Guard was created
to protect the community.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.952
But it was exhausting constantly
being under its watchful eye.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.707

being cut off from the world.

on a deserted island for 39 days

- Pizza or tacos?
- I don't understand.

19:12.777 --> 19:15.654
I know. It's a very
controversial question.

No, I-I'm confused, I don't know
what pizza versus tacos
