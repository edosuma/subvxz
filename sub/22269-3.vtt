WEBVTT

00:19.353 --> 00:21.438
Burn my farm...

00:21.439 --> 00:23.356
Kill my son!

00:23.357 --> 00:24.691
They're all bloody
going to die!

00:24.692 --> 00:25.734
Father!

00:25.735 --> 00:26.818
Father Jeppum,

00:26.819 --> 00:28.695
we don't know that this
was the Dengdamors,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.363
and we don't know
that Panto is dead!

00:30.364 --> 00:31.865
Panto is missing.

00:31.866 --> 00:32.991
Want me to think

00:32.992 --> 00:34.075
that they took him
on some kind of holiday?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.827
He said he was trying
to get to the other world.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.912
He said Wakti Wapnasi
was going to help him

00:37.913 --> 00:39.289
to fulfill the prophecy.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.832
Our home is Inglenook,

00:40.833 --> 00:43.168
and the Dengdamors plan
on burning it all away.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.503
It's only because of
the missing boy,

00:45.504 --> 00:46.713
Farson!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.089
The Dengdamors think
we're responsible.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.591
If we could just find him--

00:49.592 --> 00:52.136
Find the boy? Find the boy?

00:53.679 --> 00:56.223
My son, your brother, is dead.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.184
Shame you, Litzibitz!

01:01.771 --> 01:02.980
Shame you!

01:03.981 --> 01:05.607
Kellum Knights!

01:05.608 --> 01:06.524
Halt!

01:06.525 --> 01:07.650
Father!

01:07.651 --> 01:10.153
Pleasant evening, Sir Trost.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.613
Did you bring
the weapon you showed me?

01:11.614 --> 01:12.781
In the box,

01:12.782 --> 01:14.909
a gift from the Mage.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.622
These men serve the Mage, Father.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.999
The evil that will tear our world apart.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.044
Abandon the prophecy.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.089
This...

01:29.048 --> 01:32.509
This is real.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.469
Death to the Dengdamors!

02:05.709 --> 02:07.335
Rise and shine, everybody!

02:07.336 --> 02:09.295
We got a full of day of...

02:09.296 --> 02:11.256
well, nothing.

02:11.257 --> 02:13.716
But now that you guys are up,
you wanna hang out?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.510
What's happening? Are we free to go?

02:15.511 --> 02:16.803
Just 'cause you're prisoners

02:16.804 --> 02:19.139
does not mean you have to live
like caged animals.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.431
Actually,

02:20.432 --> 02:21.850
the term "prisoner" literally--

02:21.851 --> 02:24.435
Means something different today
than it used to.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.436
Words change meaning.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.312
Like "literally,"

02:26.313 --> 02:28.648
which now figuratively means "totally."

02:28.649 --> 02:29.732
So it's perfectly acceptable to say--

02:29.733 --> 02:30.984
It's too early for this.

02:30.985 --> 02:31.943
Excuse me, Tina,

02:31.944 --> 02:33.862
I know this is a strange ask,

02:33.863 --> 02:36.406
but, um, do you have
any clothes I could wear?

02:36.407 --> 02:37.907
Clothes? Sure.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.993
We got all sorts of old uniforms.

02:39.994 --> 02:40.869
You're offering us...

02:40.870 --> 02:42.662
police uniforms?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.746
Old ones.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.249
Plus, if you wanna look,
Hobbs has got stuff in evidence lock-up

02:46.250 --> 02:49.127
from the campgrounds every year
after <i>Sound of Nothing,</i> since, like, the '80s.

02:49.128 --> 02:51.213
And by <i>Sound of Nothing,</i> you mean...

02:52.298 --> 02:53.298
It's a music festival.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.257
You're telling me

02:54.258 --> 02:56.426
you've got, like, vintage police uniforms,

02:56.427 --> 02:58.720
and old rockstar, hippy clothes,

02:58.721 --> 03:01.890
and you're just willing
to let us wear them?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.349
Yup.
Wanna come on out and take a look?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.225
Mm-hm.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.311
Okay.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.979
Door.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.147
Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry!

03:17.781 --> 03:19.240
Hmm.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.285
Best case ever.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.662
Wait, don't look yet.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.831
Okay, come on.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.667
It's not like I haven't seen it all before.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.378
Not in this harsh lighting.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.548
You look great, though.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.217
It suits you.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.718
This feels wrong.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.886
I mean, yeah,

03:39.887 --> 03:42.055
I've wanted to work in law enforcement
my entire life,

03:42.056 --> 03:44.515
just like the rest of my family, but...

03:44.516 --> 03:47.645
I mean, a uniform is
something to be... earned.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.731
Wait...

03:53.984 --> 03:57.237
Ma'am, do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

03:57.238 --> 04:00.949
Oh, officer, was I going too fast?

04:00.950 --> 04:02.200
Yup.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.744
I became a cop 'cause I love guns

04:04.745 --> 04:06.996
every bit as much as I hate fun--

04:06.997 --> 04:08.289
Okay, you're ruining it.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.291
Right.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.670
- Sorry!
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.677
Oh... okay.

04:21.679 --> 04:22.929
Would you look at that?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.806
Whoa.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.516
Nice chisel work, Sheriff.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.642
Would you like to give it a try?

04:27.643 --> 04:28.601
No, I'm...

04:28.602 --> 04:30.645
I read in your file that
you're trained in this stuff.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.729
No, really--

04:31.730 --> 04:32.939
Otherwise, we gotta call the coroner.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.315
He's two hours away.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.858
Come on. Why not?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.569
Well, laws. All the laws, but--

04:38.570 --> 04:40.072
- Just take it.
- Yeah.

04:44.827 --> 04:45.910
Hey!

04:45.911 --> 04:46.786
Dirk!

04:46.787 --> 04:48.329
We've got a dead body
in a tree in here,

04:48.330 --> 04:50.206
and they're letting us poke it.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.457
Do you wanna take a look?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.542
Um...

04:52.543 --> 04:54.585
This is like the most
Dirk-type deal I've ever seen.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.380
I think I'm okay out here for now,
thank you, Todd.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.967
You all seem to have
the tree... man under control,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.052
so...

05:03.053 --> 05:04.345
Maybe he's squeamish.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.347
He's not.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.898
Oh! What made those holes? Bugs?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.692
No...

05:17.401 --> 05:19.986
Look at the fissures around the hole.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.322
It's a puncture wound.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.407
He was already dead

05:24.408 --> 05:26.659
when whatever put him in a tree...

05:26.660 --> 05:28.202
put him there.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.163
<i>This was a murder.</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:38.629
Vogel, I appreciate you
stealing this food for me,

05:38.630 --> 05:42.216
but maybe let's just keep,
like, a lower profile.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.927
Right, "profile."

05:44.928 --> 05:45.762
I know that word.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.889
Just... less smashing.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.098
And if anyone asks,

05:49.099 --> 05:50.808
you can tell them
that you're my, uh...

05:50.809 --> 05:51.935
Son!

05:54.438 --> 05:55.814
You're older than me.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.523
Grandson!

05:57.524 --> 05:58.608
Boyfriend.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.234
What!?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.196
Gah!

06:03.197 --> 06:04.364
Ah!

06:04.365 --> 06:06.699
All right, calm down,
this is just rude now.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.701
Bah...

06:23.967 --> 06:25.301
<i>How did you find them?</i>

06:25.302 --> 06:29.180
Oh, come on,
finding them wasn't hard.

06:29.181 --> 06:35.103
A rash of assaults and vandalisms
by two young people clad in black.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.688
They're traveling in a car
with a "3" on it.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.441
It's not exactly geometry.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.239
So this has got to be
Hector Cardenas then, right?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.323
Yeah, yeah.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.575
I mean, both bodies are the same age,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.577
only two miles apart.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.871
Could whatever put him
inside the tree

06:53.872 --> 06:56.374
put the car up in the other tree?

06:56.375 --> 06:59.502
Like some kind of tree... weapon?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.462
I'm just spit-balling.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.755
Maybe..

07:02.756 --> 07:04.632
it was an accident.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.758
An accident?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.261
Yeah, like...

07:08.137 --> 07:09.971
they had some kind of argument,

07:09.972 --> 07:13.391
and he got angry, and went...

07:13.392 --> 07:15.978
inside the tree...

07:17.229 --> 07:20.857
and then she flew her new car off

07:20.858 --> 07:23.818
up into the...

07:23.819 --> 07:25.070
sky...

07:26.405 --> 07:27.530
What is going on with you?

07:27.531 --> 07:29.241
Nothing. Fine-ness.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.963
Okay, actually,

07:43.964 --> 07:46.925
what if it were more of a case of--

07:50.179 --> 07:51.095
Hi, Dirk.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.103
I'd like to report a crime.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.775
I want to understand, I really do,

08:04.776 --> 08:08.404
but why is there not
like, a breakdown video,

08:08.405 --> 08:11.157
you know, just all this,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.533
boom, ten minutes.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.535
Done.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.703
And it only goes back to 2005,

08:15.704 --> 08:18.247
after the first program
had already been shut down.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.958
Where's all the other stuff,
from, like, the original...

08:20.959 --> 08:22.001
Oh, it's...

08:22.002 --> 08:23.628
It's right here.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.046
They never had them converted.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.174
Apparently it wasn't a priority.

08:28.592 --> 08:32.845
We have a drive to access these disks,
but they're encrypted.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.555
We'd have to get an authorization,

08:34.556 --> 08:36.349
have a cyber guy sent over,
fill out a full report--

08:36.350 --> 08:39.852
Uh... Cyber, like a...

08:39.853 --> 08:42.355
computer guy?

08:42.356 --> 08:44.857
Like a tech...

08:44.858 --> 08:46.067
guy?

08:46.068 --> 08:48.361
You want me to de-encrypt

08:48.362 --> 08:50.196
a five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy disk

08:50.197 --> 08:51.989
from the year 2000?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.282
Yes.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.743
Like as an in-house,

08:55.744 --> 08:58.663
sort of hush-hush deal.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.206
A "hush-hush" deal.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.501
Yeah, 'cause I don't want to ask
the people above me,

09:03.502 --> 09:06.337
the, um, the money--
you know, the supervisors,

09:06.338 --> 09:08.381
I don't want them to know

09:08.382 --> 09:10.591
that I don't really
know what I'm doing,

09:10.592 --> 09:14.304
so I thought this could be
like a you-and-me thing.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.769
Well, encryption on disks this old
is definitely outdated.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.646
I mean, there is a chance I could do it
with the right equipment.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.524
Okay, yeah.
Anything you need, yeah.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.692
I mean, what is this stuff?

09:27.693 --> 09:30.361
That's the... stuff, man,

09:30.362 --> 09:31.946
on the subjects. Marzanna--

09:31.947 --> 09:32.822
Bart?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.031
The whole deal,

09:34.032 --> 09:35.701
all the people
they used to keep in here.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.912
And you're gonna give me access

09:39.913 --> 09:41.163
to read all of that?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.915
Yeah.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.294
As a... favor?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.882
Can I get out of this taxi?

09:56.555 --> 09:57.763
So just right this way.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.849
Right this way... uh, Madam.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.225
Here we go.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.227
Okay.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.563
Okay, there, we're just gonna,
you know, keep you in there,

10:05.564 --> 10:07.064
for, uh, just for right now.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.858
Look, this is pointless.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.568
Nothing can keep me captured.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.487
You think I haven't been
in one of these before?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.030
If I wanna open it,

10:14.031 --> 10:16.450
it'll just open 'cause it's old,
or broken, or whatever.

10:17.618 --> 10:21.496
I'm not the person out there
attacking people with shapes.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.748
Hey...

10:23.749 --> 10:25.208
do you guys know Ken?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.501
Ken Schmidt?

10:27.502 --> 10:28.586
6'6", red hair?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.921
There are two Kens?

10:30.922 --> 10:31.881
Okay, enough.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.133
What happened to you?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.051
Oh, I'm not talking to you.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.677
I'm only talking to real police officers.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.262
You know what, this woman,

10:38.263 --> 10:40.056
she stabbed me in the leg,

10:40.057 --> 10:42.099
so I'm not talking
to you two until you--

10:42.100 --> 10:43.225
Fine!

10:43.226 --> 10:44.811
Fine by me.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.438
Uh, Tina?

10:47.439 --> 10:48.981
Ahem. Okay.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.483
Whose blood is on you right now?

10:50.484 --> 10:53.861
Okay, so I was
killing people down by this hole

10:53.862 --> 10:55.071
after I fell off my bike.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.489
They're all dead,

10:56.490 --> 10:57.657
but there's this woman there,

10:57.658 --> 10:59.033
and she's screaming and crying,

10:59.034 --> 11:01.535
and so I says to her,
"I will not kill you,"

11:01.536 --> 11:03.496
so she picks up this stick,

11:03.497 --> 11:06.540
and she shoots these shapes
into the air, and then bam!

11:06.541 --> 11:08.793
I go down into this big hole!

11:08.794 --> 11:11.295
I mean, what's that about, right?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.089
Well, I didn't even kill her,

11:13.090 --> 11:15.049
and she attacked me for no reason.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.135
Have you ever had somebody
attack you for no reason?

11:18.136 --> 11:20.096
Y-You tried to kill me!

11:20.097 --> 11:22.390
Dirk, I did not kill you two times.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.768
Right now, it makes three times
I'm not killing you.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.771
I mean, we're practically best friends.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.397
Whoa, I'm just gonna...

11:29.398 --> 11:31.482
Hey, uh, just take a time-out here,

11:31.483 --> 11:33.026
I want to rewind you back a little bit.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.030
Did you say that
you were killing people?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.283
Look, I'm trying to be better.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.787
You know? I'm trying
to take control of my life.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.748
So I'm killing some people,
and not other people.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.291
The woman who attacked you,

11:49.292 --> 11:50.960
do you remember
anything else about her?

11:50.961 --> 11:54.463
Yeah, she had yellow hair,
and she couldn't walk right,

11:54.464 --> 11:58.467
and she made a noise like, uh...

11:58.468 --> 12:02.805
"Oh, my God!
Please don't kill me!"

12:02.806 --> 12:04.265
Blech.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.517
Give us a second.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.771
We'll be right back.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.107
Blonde hair and a limp.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.316
That sounds like Suzie Boreton.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.276
Yes, of course.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.110
Who is she?

12:16.111 --> 12:17.653
Married to Bob Boreton.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.113
He manages
the Sit and Stay Put Motel.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.865
That's where we were staying.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.533
Shit, I knew the name
Cardenas was familiar.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.743
It was on the sign for the motel.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.327
That's right,
they owned it in the '60s.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.162
Yeah! Aah, man! Aah!

12:26.163 --> 12:27.455
That's a...

12:27.456 --> 12:29.373
This is one of the, uh...

12:29.374 --> 12:30.583
Everything is connected?

12:30.584 --> 12:31.917
Yes! Yes!

12:31.918 --> 12:34.462
Arrest her
and shoot her in the face!

12:34.463 --> 12:36.422
She's... less catchy.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.435
Jeanette!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.937
Hi! Ooh...

12:53.607 --> 12:55.649
Hello, ladies.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.779
I am so excited for book club today.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.449
Or more like wine club,
if you know what I'm saying?

13:18.924 --> 13:20.175
Come on out.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.219
Hey, Hobbs, I meant to say,

13:23.220 --> 13:26.931
I really appreciate the "not turning us in
and letting us come along" thing.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.098
Oh, yeah, well, you know,

13:28.099 --> 13:30.559
things get pretty slow
around here.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.894
So, let me ask you,

13:31.895 --> 13:34.689
what, um, what's your deal?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.649
I mean, does he, uh...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.150
well, does he pay you?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.485
He's my friend.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.653
He helps me.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.363
Or not exactly "helps," but...

13:42.364 --> 13:44.615
It's good to know that not everything
happens for a reason,

13:44.616 --> 13:46.158
like, maybe some things do?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.243
Huh.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.994
Yeah, yeah...

13:48.995 --> 13:50.329
Yeah, I like that.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.921
Something feels strange.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.089
That's a good sign.

14:00.090 --> 14:00.923
It means we're close to something.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.007
No, no, nothing holistic,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.260
it's just, uh...

14:03.927 --> 14:04.927
If nobody's home,

14:04.928 --> 14:06.720
why isn't the dog barking?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.347
Yeah, the dog should be
barking its head off right now.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.349
The dang thing is always in a tantrum.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.183
Wait.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.477
Where's Dirk?

14:17.858 --> 14:18.858
Oh--

14:18.859 --> 14:20.193
Excuse me.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.528
Hello.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.738
Sorry to interrupt your...

14:24.739 --> 14:27.241
whatever this is,

14:27.242 --> 14:29.201
uh, but my name is Dirk Gently.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.580
I'm a detective working
with local law enforcement.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.832
Uh, okay, listen--

14:34.833 --> 14:37.126
Ooh, you seem... ill.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.170
Are you distressed, or--

14:40.171 --> 14:42.381
okay, listen,
maybe actually just very scary.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.300
So, I, uh...

14:44.301 --> 14:46.635
I'm-I'm here about an incident

14:46.636 --> 14:48.387
that may have involved your wife,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.764
and a very murdery type of person

14:50.765 --> 14:52.349
who identifies as "Bart,"

14:52.350 --> 14:53.893
but I'm sure you're fine, actually,

14:53.894 --> 14:55.228
and come to think of it,
I should maybe be going--

15:05.530 --> 15:06.531
Dirk!

15:14.289 --> 15:15.456
Todd?

15:15.457 --> 15:16.458
Bob!

15:17.626 --> 15:18.709
Oh!

15:18.710 --> 15:21.003
Put the gol-darn gun down, Bob.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.838
Trespassing.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.006
Bob, can you hear me?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.466
Put the goddamn gun down, Bob!

15:39.022 --> 15:41.231
Where'd you get
the brass knuckles from?

15:41.232 --> 15:43.317
You didn't...
you didn't search us.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.361
Right.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.373
May I make a professional
recommendation?

15:57.374 --> 15:59.250
Let me kill Incubus Number Four.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.336
Uh, kill him?

16:02.337 --> 16:04.756
No, we're supposed
to capture subjects.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.133
All right.

16:08.134 --> 16:12.096
Project Incubus was originally
only three individuals.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.766
Once we added the fourth,
things got out of control,

16:15.767 --> 16:19.520
so if things go oblong out here,

16:19.521 --> 16:22.856
<i>it might be a good idea to just
casualty the both of them,</i>

16:22.857 --> 16:25.818
Incubus Four
and the Brotzman girl too.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.653
She's just a civilian.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.115
I read in your file that
you almost shot her in the head.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.909
<i>So why is she so important now?</i>

16:34.160 --> 16:36.453
We can use her to control them.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.123
She's valuable,
these people are valuable.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.750
Yeah, well...

16:42.168 --> 16:44.670
you're way over there,
and I'm over here.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.921
We'll see how it goes.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.382
Yeah, well, good luck.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.092
There's no way you're gonna be
able to sneak up on them,

16:50.093 --> 16:53.221
'cause won't the energy vampire
just smell you coming?

16:54.097 --> 16:55.557
We'll see how it goes.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.893
The stab wounds seem random
at first observation,

16:59.894 --> 17:01.437
but they're not.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.188
They're on the same geometric line

17:03.189 --> 17:06.316
even though they go off
in two different directions.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.652
Hmm.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.488
Wasn't the middle and index finger

17:11.489 --> 17:13.198
on the other corpse broken?

17:13.199 --> 17:14.533
Right,

17:14.534 --> 17:17.870
but she's all broken up
from the crash, isn't she?

17:17.871 --> 17:20.539
Yeah, but those two fingers...

17:22.417 --> 17:24.084
Oh, never mind, it's probably nothing.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.295
You're sad!

17:25.879 --> 17:27.588
- What?
- Is it about you and Todd?

17:27.589 --> 17:29.089
No, we're just friends.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.174
You and Dirk?

17:30.175 --> 17:32.092
Oh! Are they together?

17:32.093 --> 17:33.385
'Cause I was getting that vibe,
not strongly,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.304
but I could see
how someone would, like--

17:35.305 --> 17:37.514
No, Todd isn't...

17:37.515 --> 17:39.266
or rather, Dirk-- I don't think he--

17:39.267 --> 17:42.686
You know, actually,
I don't know what Dirk is.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.521
Hey, man, it's cool.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.439
I'm bi.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.607
No judgment here.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.026
I just thought maybe
that's why you're sad.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.236
I'm not sad.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.281
I'm sort of an empath.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.365
I think?

17:55.366 --> 17:59.078
Truth is, I'm coming out of a 10 to...

17:59.079 --> 18:00.996
15-year dark period

18:00.997 --> 18:03.499
where I experimented
with some pretty heavy drugs.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.630
Yeah, Hobbs?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.964
<i>Someone might have
hit someone with their car,</i>

18:10.965 --> 18:13.008
but if they did,
it definitely wasn't me.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.676
<i>Uh, who is this?</i>

18:14.677 --> 18:17.179
Mile Marker 127.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.431
Scott Boreton, is that you?

18:20.975 --> 18:21.976
Uhh!

18:23.853 --> 18:24.937
Weird.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.980
Who was that?

18:28.233 --> 18:30.484
I think that was Scott Boreton,

18:30.485 --> 18:33.737
and I think he just reported a hit-and-run.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.281
Wanna go check it out?

18:41.246 --> 18:44.623
There ya go, Bob. You're okay.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.541
What's wrong with him?

18:45.542 --> 18:48.377
Well, that crack
on the noggin didn't help,

18:48.378 --> 18:50.504
but he's showing no signs
of concussion, at least.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.380
I did find these, though,

18:51.381 --> 18:52.256
Percocet,

18:52.257 --> 18:53.757
plus an empty
bottle of wine out there.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.592
I think he just needs to sleep it off.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.886
I don't get it.
You're not going to arrest him?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.848
Well, no, technically,
we were the ones trespassing.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.307
He pulled a gun on us.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.934
That's true, but he didn't...

19:03.935 --> 19:05.644
he didn't actually shoot it at anybody.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.312
Yeah, because I stopped him.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.981
This is like my ultimate nightmare.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.482
I'm telling a cop how to do their job.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.026
Look, man, I'm not going
to just wander around arresting everyone.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.320
You are literally a police officer.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.363
This is connected.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.116
Well--

19:19.117 --> 19:21.785
Everything in your town
has gone weird in a three-day span,

19:21.786 --> 19:24.121
and your fallback is "it's a coincidence"

19:24.122 --> 19:26.331
when you have a man literally telling you

19:26.332 --> 19:28.959
"I'm here to deal with
all the weird coincidences."

19:28.960 --> 19:30.502
Acknowledge and engage

19:30.503 --> 19:33.130
the bizarre and preposterous
set of events befalling you,

19:33.131 --> 19:35.341
or be swept under them and drown!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.177
That was a little bit harsher

19:38.178 --> 19:39.637
than the speech you gave me, Dirk.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.848
He's got a lot on his mind.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.267
No, no, no, that's fine.
I understand.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.353
<i>Farah's making me call you.</i>

19:48.354 --> 19:49.563
Why?

19:49.564 --> 19:51.190
<i>Well, we had to go out on a call,</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:52.566
<i>and the prisoner, Bart,
we left her alone.</i>

19:52.567 --> 19:55.862
Well, now, Tina, you left
the dang prisoner alone?

19:56.321 --> 19:57.779
<i>Well, we got a call!</i>

19:57.780 --> 20:00.033
Heckin' dang it.
Okay, come on, we gotta go.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.408
Tina...

20:01.409 --> 20:03.286
Happy now?

20:05.580 --> 20:06.748
Weed gummy?

20:14.631 --> 20:16.173
You don't mind holding my gun, right?

20:16.174 --> 20:17.299
No.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.343
It hurts when I'm driving.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.137
That's 'cause it's a bad holster for you.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.472
For your body type,

20:23.473 --> 20:25.891
you'd need a shoulder holster or a sling.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.687
Man, how do you remember
all this stuff, huh?

20:30.688 --> 20:33.148
My father.

20:33.149 --> 20:37.319
When I was young,
he put me in classes.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.239
For all sorts of
advanced placement.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.658
He'd teach me some of them.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.368
It was fun.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.828
Sounds intense.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.873
I like intense.

20:52.085 --> 20:52.918
Hey, there it is.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.712
Mile marker 127.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.391
Gun.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.815
Someone was struck
by a car right here.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.694
That looks like blood.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.862
Hey...

21:20.488 --> 21:22.365
Whoever it was came from here.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.787
Look.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.957
These footprints are distinctive.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.125
Yup, I've seen these before.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.459
These are the same shoes

21:34.460 --> 21:36.421
leading out of
the Cardenas farmhouse.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.840
Wouldn't a normal person
who gets hit by a car

21:39.841 --> 21:41.425
stay on the road?

21:41.426 --> 21:44.387
This person just
walks off into a field.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.557
All right, come on.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.683
We can follow
the crooked stems

21:49.684 --> 21:51.310
through the high grass.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.812
Your dad teach you this one too?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.187
No.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.814
This was the Army Rangers.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.233
Power Rangers?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.152
Army Rangers...

22:00.153 --> 22:02.404
Who saw last night's episode
of <i>That is Them</i>?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.323
Don't say another word!

22:04.324 --> 22:05.240
I'm not caught up.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.700
Jeanette, you can't fall behind!

22:06.701 --> 22:08.660
The best thing about book club
is talking about TV.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.128
Is something wrong?

22:18.129 --> 22:19.504
No.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.672
Nothing.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.758
I mean...

22:23.760 --> 22:24.676
Look at me!

22:25.762 --> 22:27.554
Guys, come on.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.764
Look at me!

22:28.765 --> 22:30.682
Yes, we've seen you.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.684
So, why haven't you said anything?

22:32.685 --> 22:34.394
Frankly, we don't know what to say.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.604
It's bizarre.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.939
And you know you're not invited
to book club anymore.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.775
I mean, it's worrying,

22:39.776 --> 22:41.360
you coming in here like this,

22:41.361 --> 22:44.113
like you're having some kind
of psychiatric breakdown.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.783
"Worried"?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.870
Now you're worried about me?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.624
You've never cared about me.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.376
None of you.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.878
You've just made fun of me
behind my back.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.881
For Scotty
always getting detention,

23:02.882 --> 23:05.175
or that our house
is a little run down,

23:05.176 --> 23:07.552
or that I have to work
at the quarry,

23:07.553 --> 23:10.222
and don't have
a nice ladylike job.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.391
Hmm?

23:12.392 --> 23:15.019
Well, I'm sorry.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.731
Our family needs two incomes.

23:20.525 --> 23:21.608
We can't all have husbands

23:21.609 --> 23:25.195
who rake in the big bucks
as tractor salesmen,

23:25.196 --> 23:27.322
or grain co-op managers,

23:27.323 --> 23:30.450
or franchise owners
of Gas 'n' Gulp.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.371
So just... put me down
to make yourselves feel better.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.499
But I'm tryin'.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.376
I'm tryin'.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.503
I am out here on my own,

23:41.504 --> 23:43.588
<i>and I get nothin'...</i>

23:43.589 --> 23:46.341
<i>nothin' but dirt from all of you,</i>

23:46.342 --> 23:49.344
even though I have always been

23:49.345 --> 23:50.847
the nice one.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.056
Always.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.268
You screwed my boyfriend.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.437
That's high school, Karen!

23:58.438 --> 23:59.646
I needed friends!

23:59.647 --> 24:01.565
You were prom queen.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.025
You had all the friends, Suzie.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.986
You can't be that deluded.

24:05.987 --> 24:06.945
So it's jealousy.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.155
Because you all abandoned me--

24:08.156 --> 24:09.906
We abandoned you?

24:09.907 --> 24:13.076
You told everyone that Lisa
screwed Mr. Hauser--

24:13.077 --> 24:15.328
Lisa told everyone I was
smoking cigarettes behind the gym!

24:15.329 --> 24:16.413
You were!

24:16.414 --> 24:18.415
Oh, who cares?

24:18.416 --> 24:21.668
Really? This is what
you all focus on? Huh?

24:21.669 --> 24:23.628
You all think you're so...

24:23.629 --> 24:26.382
Yeah, well, where were you
during the accident, huh?

24:26.883 --> 24:27.966
Where were you

24:27.967 --> 24:30.135
when I couldn't walk?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.219
And my hip--

24:31.220 --> 24:32.929
The accident?

24:32.930 --> 24:36.266
You were driving on a Xanax
when you crashed your dang car.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.019
You were driving carpool.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.730
My kid was in that car,

24:41.731 --> 24:44.483
and you expect me to worry
about your dang hip?

24:44.484 --> 24:46.401
Are you some kind of freakin' idiot?

24:46.402 --> 24:48.987
You didn't even call to apologize!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.489
You've been avoiding all of us,

24:50.490 --> 24:52.824
holed up in that house
with your poor stupid husband,

24:52.825 --> 24:56.286
limpin' around
feelin' sorry for yourself for four years,

24:56.287 --> 24:58.705
like you're some kind
of underdog hero.

24:58.706 --> 24:59.998
Well, you're not, Suzie.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.750
You're not!

25:01.751 --> 25:03.628
You're one of the bad guys!

25:04.378 --> 25:05.379
Vensas!

25:16.641 --> 25:18.059
Mm-hmm...

25:19.769 --> 25:20.853
Pink hair.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.897
Halt where you stand!

25:23.898 --> 25:24.731
Hey. Easy...

25:24.732 --> 25:26.192
Why are you following me?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.487
Why does this bear
the insignia of The Mage?

25:30.238 --> 25:31.738
What was the metal creature
that attacked me?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.407
- Tina!
- Sorry! Sorry. Sorry.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.867
Sorry!

25:35.868 --> 25:38.245
Put down the scissors,
and we'll talk about it!

25:38.246 --> 25:39.204
Put down the scissors.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.540
Put 'em down, man!

25:50.550 --> 25:51.926
Tina! Yo-yo!

26:05.147 --> 26:07.440
Whoo!

26:07.441 --> 26:08.441
Yeah, girl!

26:08.442 --> 26:09.526
I mean, it's cool.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.319
Ahem. I'm cool. It's cool.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.321
It's a good job, though.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.994
Hey! What are you--

26:18.995 --> 26:21.329
There you are. Where did you go?
Did you get her?

26:21.330 --> 26:24.332
How'd you get the bell
from out here into your cell?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.876
Maybe don't get so close to that.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.086
Right, thank you.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.379
Hey, I'm not
talking to you anymore--

26:29.380 --> 26:31.631
You're being weird.
Even for you.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.467
Well, I was just thrown through a doghouse
by a zombie, Todd, so--

26:34.468 --> 26:36.344
You were being weird before that.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.721
Don't you think all of this relates back

26:37.722 --> 26:39.223
to finding the boy?

26:41.851 --> 26:44.561
I thought you were excited
about being on a new case.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.770
What's with the attitude?

26:45.771 --> 26:46.688
I am--

26:46.689 --> 26:49.817
Or-- yeah, I-I was, but...

26:52.695 --> 26:56.073
Why do you have pararibulitus, Todd?

26:57.408 --> 26:59.034
Why?

26:59.035 --> 27:00.703
Exactly.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.626
Find the lady,
and I'll give you the bell!

27:07.627 --> 27:08.585
Find the lady,

27:08.586 --> 27:10.086
and I'll give you the bell!

27:10.087 --> 27:12.297
It's okay...

27:12.298 --> 27:13.799
It'll be okay...

27:15.217 --> 27:17.260
God, Mom, where you been?

27:17.261 --> 27:19.430
There's nothing to eat!
I'm starving!

27:20.097 --> 27:22.140
Honey, hi, I'm sorry.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.433
I was busy today.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.685
You know, Dad's sleeping
in his room.

27:25.686 --> 27:26.686
Looks like he hit his head.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.979
His head? Hmm!

27:27.980 --> 27:29.773
And I can't find
the dog anywhere.

27:29.774 --> 27:32.609
And you look...

27:32.610 --> 27:34.069
weird,

27:34.070 --> 27:35.028
like, different.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.780
Ugh, okay, I don't
wanna talk about it, all right?

27:36.781 --> 27:38.074
Just give me my phone back.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.117
Your phone?

27:40.660 --> 27:41.952
Your phone...

27:47.833 --> 27:49.210
Shit.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.846
This is it.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.932
This place is important.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.893
Something happens here,

28:06.894 --> 28:09.187
or happened here.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.397
I can't tell.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.899
So, what now, boss?

28:19.573 --> 28:20.574
18.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.787
Thank you.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.182
Holy shit.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.976
My name is on this pill bottle.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.811
Ha!

28:49.812 --> 28:52.314
How can that even possibly be?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.152
Oh, my God.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.111
No way.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.530
Todd?

29:07.705 --> 29:09.665
Oh, no way, no way, no way!

29:12.251 --> 29:13.334
Drummer!

29:13.335 --> 29:15.378
You did it! You found them!

29:15.379 --> 29:16.254
Wait!

29:16.255 --> 29:17.797
Lemme go, man!
What's your malfunction?

29:17.798 --> 29:18.883
No, no, no, something's not--

29:19.550 --> 29:20.551
Guys!

29:20.760 --> 29:21.761
Guys!

29:24.805 --> 29:26.389
Hello, Vogel.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.267
No... Y-you?

29:29.018 --> 29:30.018
It's Blackwing.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.146
It's Black... It's Blackwing!

29:33.647 --> 29:34.856
It's Blackwing!

29:34.857 --> 29:36.108
It's Blackwing!

29:50.206 --> 29:52.082
You can talk to me, you know.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.169
He's got pink hair.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.547
The unconscious guy,
he's got pink hair.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.425
Because of course he does.

30:02.760 --> 30:07.306
Dirk, why did you ask me
why I had pararibulitus?

30:09.683 --> 30:11.352
Because...

30:14.897 --> 30:18.858
When I was in Blackwing,
I wanted to get out so badly.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.653
I had this fantasy
that I would escape,

30:21.654 --> 30:24.572
and just go right back
to you and Farah,

30:24.573 --> 30:26.199
and we would start
the detective agency,

30:26.200 --> 30:27.992
and it would be brilliant.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.912
We would solve mysteries
and help people,

30:30.913 --> 30:32.997
and it would all be somehow...

30:32.998 --> 30:35.334
I don't know, better.

30:36.627 --> 30:37.753
Calmer.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.382
But nothing's better.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.009
Nothing's calmer.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.136
It all just is--

30:47.137 --> 30:48.848
and always will be.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.312
You're not a pawn, Dirk.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.858
It's not, like... predestined.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.319
Fate and chance
don't cancel each other out.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.697
You don't know that.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.198
Yes, I do.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.825
I've seen it.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.328
I've seen you fail,
but I've also seen you win.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.831
You can't let the universe
push you around.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.459
That's how you end up
getting slammed through doghouses.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.170
You have to make bigger choices.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.506
You want answers?

31:24.300 --> 31:26.927
Take control of your life, Dirk.

31:28.012 --> 31:30.346
Is that your British accent?
That was awful--

31:30.347 --> 31:31.431
- I don't do accents.
- No, I love it.

31:31.432 --> 31:32.433
Yo.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.851
Pink hair's awake.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.073
Vensas!

32:43.921 --> 32:45.381
I know you're there.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.430
<i>I believe you have something of mine.
I'd like it back.</i>

32:54.765 --> 32:57.308
If you won't give it,

32:57.309 --> 32:58.811
I'll have to take it.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.327
No... No...

33:16.328 --> 33:17.955
No, it's mine!

33:25.462 --> 33:28.090
Hello again, Suzanne Boreton.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.052
What a pleasant surprise.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.516
My name is Panto Trost,

33:38.517 --> 33:40.393
Lord Prince
of the Valley of Inglenook

33:40.394 --> 33:41.770
in the Land of Wendimoor.

33:42.438 --> 33:43.688
<i>I came to your world</i>

33:43.689 --> 33:46.190
<i>through the Pool of the Empty Throne,</i>

33:46.191 --> 33:48.026
with help from Wakti Wapnasi,

33:48.027 --> 33:52.905
forest witch of the Santi Santiga,
who guides the Bofuki Nepoo.

33:52.906 --> 33:56.159
She foretold the prophecy
I seek to enact,

33:56.160 --> 33:59.495
that once the great dark wizard
found his apprentice,

33:59.496 --> 34:01.664
no one in Wendimoor
could defeat him,

34:01.665 --> 34:04.043
and his army
would come like a tide.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.462
The only hope to save Wendimoor

34:07.463 --> 34:10.256
is if the fiercest of foes were united,

34:10.257 --> 34:12.592
<i>the great weapon is retrieved,</i>

34:12.593 --> 34:17.430
and she-who-sees-all
opened a door into a dream,

34:17.431 --> 34:19.390
allowing through a man,

34:19.391 --> 34:21.977
who, with him, would bring a boy...

34:22.728 --> 34:25.064
<i>The boy who would save our world.</i>

34:28.317 --> 34:29.318
Um...

34:30.944 --> 34:32.237
just quickly...

34:32.946 --> 34:35.239
Who is the dark wizard,
who is his apprentice,

34:35.240 --> 34:36.949
who are the foes, who is "she,"

34:36.950 --> 34:37.950
what is the dream,

34:37.951 --> 34:38.951
who is the man,

34:38.952 --> 34:40.078
what is the "great weapon,"

34:40.079 --> 34:43.164
and, perhaps most importantly,

34:43.165 --> 34:45.209
who is the boy?

34:47.044 --> 34:48.252
Hmm...

34:48.253 --> 34:49.713
These things I know not.

34:50.881 --> 34:53.341
I have only one answer.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.677
The man who could bring the boy,

34:56.678 --> 34:59.222
the man who could save my family,

34:59.223 --> 35:00.432
my world...

35:02.226 --> 35:04.645
his name is Dirk Gently.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.693
Do you know Ken?

35:25.582 --> 35:28.168
It's not supposed to go this way.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.504
The voice said

35:31.505 --> 35:34.340
I can die here

35:34.341 --> 35:36.135
or things can change.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.722
<i>How long do y'all plan for this to go on for?</i>

35:41.723 --> 35:43.516
Honest question.

35:43.517 --> 35:45.227
I'm trying to be a friend here.

35:45.519 --> 35:49.397
<i>So what's the big plan?</i>

35:49.398 --> 35:51.608
<i>You know, what's the end game?</i>

35:54.153 --> 35:55.778
<i>Jacob!</i>

35:55.779 --> 35:58.073
<i>Amanda!</i>

36:00.951 --> 36:02.744
I could bring you back to the boys.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.455
I have the rest of Project Incubus.

36:06.456 --> 36:09.250
They are just waiting for you.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.628
This could have a very happy ending.

36:13.172 --> 36:15.089
Yeah... Yeah, good, good.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.175
Okay, okay...

36:17.593 --> 36:19.552
What do we do?

36:19.553 --> 36:20.888
I don't know.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.057
This isn't how this ends.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.893
What?

36:26.894 --> 36:29.687
This isn't how this ends.

36:29.688 --> 36:33.107
Something else
is supposed to happen.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.609
I am supposed to do something.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.528
Look, I know that guy.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.696
What if he's truthing,

36:38.697 --> 36:41.657
and the guys are out there
waiting for me?

36:41.658 --> 36:44.660
Vogel, he is not telling you the truth.

36:44.661 --> 36:47.330
The Rowdy 3 are my family, boss!

36:47.331 --> 36:48.915
You said you would help me find them.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.750
What if this is it?

36:50.751 --> 36:52.252
Vogel...

36:54.171 --> 36:55.963
you're all I've got left.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.841
Please listen to me. Okay?

36:59.593 --> 37:01.762
Don't go out there.

37:03.096 --> 37:06.016
What's it gonna be, Ms. Brotzman?

37:09.978 --> 37:11.104
Here we go.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.774
Okay.

37:21.698 --> 37:22.908
Oh, I'm sorry, boys.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.205
I can't stay here!

37:29.206 --> 37:30.791
It's that shit!

38:03.615 --> 38:05.700
Not so spooky now, eh, Dracula?

38:07.077 --> 38:07.952
Yes!

38:07.953 --> 38:08.828
Yes, subdue him!

38:08.829 --> 38:10.413
Detain him now!

38:10.414 --> 38:14.417
I'll do things on my calendar,
Mr. Friedkin, thank you.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.882
Come on!

38:23.844 --> 38:24.886
Come on.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.101
Things have gotten out of control.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.436
I'm switching to lethal.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.646
<i>No, no, capture them alive!</i>

38:36.732 --> 38:37.690
I'm taking the shot.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.359
No, do not take the shot!

38:40.986 --> 38:41.986
That is an order.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.904
Do not take the shot.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.114
I'm taking the shot.

38:45.115 --> 38:46.907
Do not take the shot!

38:46.908 --> 38:48.452
I'm taking the shot.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.432
I took the shot.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.897
No, no, something's wrong,
something's wrong, okay?

39:17.898 --> 39:18.981
Someone's got to do something!

39:18.982 --> 39:19.982
Someone's going to do something.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.885
I'm sorry, boss!

39:47.886 --> 39:49.262
I messed up!

39:49.930 --> 39:51.348
<i>I messed up!</i>

39:52.849 --> 39:54.892
Whoever you are,
if you're gonna do something,

39:54.893 --> 39:57.019
why don't you do it now?

39:57.020 --> 39:58.355
Do it now!

40:05.195 --> 40:07.405
Don't... do... Oh...

40:34.099 --> 40:35.600
Yeah, they vanished.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.438
They vanished?

40:42.524 --> 40:44.025
Hoo, boy...

40:46.319 --> 40:48.238
This is gonna be a wild one!
