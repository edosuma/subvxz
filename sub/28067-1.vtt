WEBVTT

00:17.476 --> 00:18.761
Oh.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.723
Oh, good morning. Hi. Hi. Hi.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.434
I'm chef goldblum.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.103
And right now

00:27.277 --> 00:29.689
I'll bet you're probably
just getting comfortable

00:29.863 --> 00:32.570
in your own
schlaaang super seat.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.198
But maybe you're
asking yourself,

00:35.369 --> 00:38.827
"what the heck is this
schlaaang super seat exactly?"

00:41.208 --> 00:43.950
Announcer: Here's how the schlaaang
super seat works!

00:44.127 --> 00:45.992
First, several needles

00:46.171 --> 00:48.162
are connected to
a vein in your arm.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.332
Chemicals are then introduced
to synchronize your emotions

00:51.510 --> 00:53.421
with the movie.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.961
Next, air tubes are inserted
into the nasal cavity

00:56.139 --> 00:59.006
to guide you into
a natural breathing pattern.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.015
Exotic odors are released

01:01.186 --> 01:03.097
to match the excitement
of the movie.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.560
Finally, your legs are moved
out of your line of sight

01:06.733 --> 01:09.850
and into our patented
schlaaang stirrups,

01:10.028 --> 01:13.520
to give you a viewing experience
you'll never forget.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.735
Oh! Oh! Oh! I gotta tell you.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.696
My favorite thing about this
whole schlaaang super seat

01:18.870 --> 01:23.204
is the automatic popcorn
machine in the armrest.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.412
Of course, be careful.
I... you know, I actually did this.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.703
That hot butter
is gonna come spurting out.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.667
Don't get it on your hand.
It's gonna burn.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.048
And remember,

01:33.218 --> 01:36.335
if you're not sitting
in a schlaaang super seat...

01:37.347 --> 01:39.508
You're just not sitting down.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.126
Announcer:
The schlaaang super seat.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.386
The ultimate film-watching
seating experience!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.775
Close your left eye.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.662
Now rapidly open and close
your left eye like this.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.584
Wow! This is easy.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.871
Announcer:
Now close your right eye.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.960
Now rapidly open and close
your right eye like this.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.263
Thank you.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.924
It is advised to remove your
dentures or false teeth

02:24.102 --> 02:25.933
before the movie begins.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.580
Man's voice: I've been walking down
these streets for years.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.060
Bonjour, diamond Jim.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.721
Bonjour.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.395
Diamond Jim, good to see you.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.026
Jim: Bonjour.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.732
Jim's voice:
They all know my name.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.988
But I can't say
that I know theirs.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.866
Jim: Bonjour.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.745
Jim's voice: What can I say?
This is my home: Sweet Paris.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.240
Jim: Bonjour.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.206
Jim's voice:
The smell of baguettes, flowers,

04:15.380 --> 04:18.291
fresh meat in the air.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.832
Bonjour.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.169
Bonjour.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.303
Bonjour.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.682
Jim's voice:
This is a town full of beautiful people

04:28.852 --> 04:30.183
all around you.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.593
Jim: Bonjour.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.512
Jim's voice:
Oui, oui. Magnifique.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.068
I'm diamond Jim.
This is my home.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.774
My people.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.780
But there's only one
that has my attention.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.929
What do I have to do
to get you to finally go out with me?

05:08.099 --> 05:09.930
Well...

05:12.187 --> 05:14.724
A girl cannot
say no to diamonds.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.765
Well, why didn't you say so?

05:24.199 --> 05:27.441
Oh, my god, it is so beautiful.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.281
Now kiss me.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.619
What the fuck was that?

06:24.175 --> 06:25.711
- That's it.
- That's our movie.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.377
- Should we?
- Let's go make a speech.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.759
Okay.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.390
One more second.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.680
Narrator:
This is the story of Tim and Eric.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.189
They were given $1 billion

06:41.359 --> 06:42.639
to make their first feature film

06:42.777 --> 06:44.517
by this man: Tommy schlaaang.

06:44.696 --> 06:48.063
I paid a billion dollars
for that piece of shit?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.601
Narrator: But Tim and Eric did not
spend their money wisely.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.280
Despite the record-setting
budget,

06:52.454 --> 06:53.854
they were only able
to edit together

06:53.914 --> 06:56.030
three minutes
of useable footage.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.727
They had expensive
personal make-overs.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.916
Tim: These two guys don't get
into premiere parties.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.878
These guys get in the front of
the line at premiere parties.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.234
Narrator: And they accidentally cast
a Johnny Depp impersonator

07:05.258 --> 07:06.748
instead of the genuine
Johnny Depp.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.030
- You said it was Johnny Depp.
- It smelled like Johnny Depp.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.032
Everyone said this is Johnny Depp
on the set. It was a big day.

07:11.056 --> 07:14.139
No, it wasn't Johnny Depp.
I know my Johnny Depp.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.051
Narrator: Other expenses included
helicopter rides to work,

07:17.228 --> 07:18.889
10-course lunches,

07:19.064 --> 07:20.895
and real diamonds
for the diamond Jim suit.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.626
The diamonds are forever,
though, and we can't return them, so...

07:24.402 --> 07:25.671
Those diamonds
aren't going back.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.231
Narrator:
They hired a personal shopper

07:27.405 --> 07:29.896
and spiritual guru
named Jim Joe Kelly,

07:30.075 --> 07:32.737
who they paid an astonishing
$500,000 a week.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.639
I'm not even walking on a set
without Jim Joe.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.432
If you think I'm gonna
get involved in something

07:36.456 --> 07:38.267
without him being a part of this,
then you're out of your mind.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.436
Narrator: They also employed a team
of personal assistants,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.542
including this
small man named Jason.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.248
Not now.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.193
Tim and I are making a speech about
our movie, and you fucking blew it.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.675
Come on, Jason, we need the hot corn
before the movie, not after the movie.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.342
- You mind if I do it?
- Go ahead.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.756
Come on!

07:55.934 --> 07:57.970
Now sit down.
Sorry about that, gang.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.260
Narrator: But perhaps
most foolishly of all,

08:00.438 --> 08:02.303
they signed a
legally binding contract

08:02.482 --> 08:04.251
with the schlaaang corporation
which held them

08:04.275 --> 08:06.357
personally responsible
for the $1 billion.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.814
I want my money back!

08:08.989 --> 08:12.322
We're going to sue you
for every dime.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.234
You motherfuckers
are going to jail

08:15.412 --> 08:17.573
for what you did!

08:17.747 --> 08:19.427
Narrator: After several
threatening letters

08:19.457 --> 08:20.993
from the schlaaang corporation,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.032
Tim and Eric realized
they needed a plan

08:23.211 --> 08:24.771
to pay back schlaaang's
billion dollars.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.082
- Shred it.
- Okay.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.090
We've really got to think
of a way to get that money back.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.216
There's got to be
an easy way to do it here.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.967
Are you guys hungry?

08:34.139 --> 08:37.347
We could get some beef chili
and hot dog buns

08:37.517 --> 08:40.099
like you like to put your mouth
around like you like to do.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.760
Ma! When we're hungry,
I'll ring the bell.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.975
Then you'll know
to put some chili on.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.313
Narrator:
After days of workshopping failed ideas,

08:48.486 --> 08:50.477
Tim and Eric faced
the very real threat

08:50.655 --> 08:52.646
of spending the rest
of their lives in jail.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.985
But first they had to
terminate their relationship

08:55.160 --> 08:57.367
with their trusted friend
and spiritual guru,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.777
Jim Joe Kelly.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.349
You're not going to believe
what I bought for you.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.988
We've got to tell him.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.158
Oh, mercy.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.755
I'm sensing some...
Real depression here.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.169
What's going on?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.008
Tell him.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.548
Jim Joe, we have to let you go.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.342
Wha...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.057
- I'm sorry.
- What? What?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.222
- It's all over, Jim Joe.
- What?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.016
- Tim: It's okay.
- What?

09:30.195 --> 09:32.982
- It's okay, Jim Joe.
- Breathe.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.487
I can't...

09:34.657 --> 09:35.897
- Tim: Breathe.
- Oh!

09:36.076 --> 09:38.692
- Jim Joe?
- Oh, god.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.360
Ohh!

09:41.372 --> 09:43.829
No! No!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.662
Pull him up.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.835
Tim: One, two, three!

10:00.058 --> 10:01.969
That's not how you do cpr.
You go like this.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.150
See? Do it. Shit.
He's drying out.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.653
- He's drying out! Put him back in!
- Change our plan!

10:20.078 --> 10:23.946
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

10:31.422 --> 10:33.413
No. No, no, no, no.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.924
Just steep it.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.964
Why can't I just work
at a reduced rate?

10:43.143 --> 10:46.510
The money's gone. We lost a billion
dollars. We're screwed.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.976
Easy, Jim Joe.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.606
Easy.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.609
After all that I've
done for you!

10:55.613 --> 10:57.444
Oh, Jim Joe.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.525
This is so much harder
for us than it is for you.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.303
All right. We're sorry.
We're just broke.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.003
Great singing voice.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.512
He's wonderful.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.548
He's remarkable.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.181
I guess this is goodbye.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.099
Time to move on.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.187
Please out.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.323
Is it "please outâ
or "peace out"?

11:42.493 --> 11:44.654
- It's up to you.
- Enjoy it.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.615
Please out.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.000
Narrator:
So, with nowhere left to go,

11:56.174 --> 11:57.943
Tim and Eric headed
to their favorite nightclub,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.754
circus disco,
to drown their sorrows.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.678
I don't know what we're
going to do, man.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.388
I think we're finished.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.678
We screwed up.
No one's ever gonna let us

12:11.856 --> 12:13.596
direct another movie
after that shit.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.767
You know, I used to have this
crazy fantasy of the two of us

12:16.945 --> 12:18.731
walking hand in hand
down that red carpet

12:18.905 --> 12:20.395
on our way
to the academy awards.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.063
That's nice.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.449
I don't think it's gonna happen.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.530
I just want to get
fucking drunk.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.865
Forget about all this
billion-dollar bullshit.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.018
I'm glad you said it because
I'm feeling the same way.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.998
I want to get so fucking high.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.330
- I want a hashish.
- I'm gonna get skit on my nose.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.711
Yo, I want to go dumb.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.212
I want to cut
my fucking arm off.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.374
I'd love to fucking get
blackout-drunk with you,

12:40.551 --> 12:41.586
get a bunch of dudes,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.171
put a bunch of shit
up our holes.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.836
Tim: Yeah,
let's go fucking nuts.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.504
Both: Let's dance!

12:53.231 --> 12:54.971
J I want to get

12:55.149 --> 12:56.605

14:04.218 --> 14:05.708
Yeah.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.720
- You all right?
- Yeah.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.934
Do you want to make
a billion dollars?

14:19.108 --> 14:22.316
It's easy. Come and run my mall.
You'll be rich.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.897
Hey, Eric, come check this out.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.779
You all love malls,
so take my mall.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.314
What's the matter?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.093
You don't want to make
a billion dollars?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.364
Anyone can run
a stupid fucking mall,

14:32.538 --> 14:34.028
even you.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.040
Are you a man,
or possibly two men,

14:37.210 --> 14:38.871
who need to make
a billion dollars?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.845
Come and run my mall.
We're having hard times.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.046
We need your ideas.
Everybody needs a billion.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.959
Come and take over the s'wallow valley
mall and pizza court.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.626
It's easy. Not hard.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.170
I said it's easy, not hard.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.806
There's never been an easier
way to make a billion dollars.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.763
It's easy. And here's
the fun part: It's easy.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.298
What's the matter? You don't want
to make a billion dollars?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.279
My day wasn't going good
until I put on these...

15:01.359 --> 15:03.270
Damian: Billion dollars.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.604
Man, I love this...

15:04.779 --> 15:05.779
Damian: Billion dollars.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.366
I'm giving away a billion...
Billion dollars!

15:11.536 --> 15:13.777
But you gotta run my mall.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.367
Please save our mall.
We need your help.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.826
Ah.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.083
I work at one of the kiosks,
and it would mean the world

15:21.254 --> 15:24.371
- if someone would come in here...
- She's so beautiful.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.336
And help us make
this mall great again.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.230
Announcer:
Come to the s'wallow valley mall,

15:29.387 --> 15:31.173
right off the 182 freeway
in s'wallow valley.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.884
Sounds crazy, Eric,
I know, but I think we can do this.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.058
Yo, I like it.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.287
- This mall could be easy money, man.
- That's right.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.832
You know what? And I'm really good at
numbers, accounting, all that stuff.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.814
Well, you know me. I'm a big p.R, ,
strategy, marketing kind of guy.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.225
But you know,
more importantly, man,

15:45.403 --> 15:47.940
I just want to say this could
be a fresh start for us.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.070
We could forget all about
this Hollywood bullshit

15:50.241 --> 15:51.651
and really reinvent ourselves.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.971
Yeah. You know, I've been meaning
to tell you this all night,

15:53.995 --> 15:56.031
but I love you, man.
And I love our friendship.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.741
Well, thank you. I honor you,

15:57.915 --> 15:59.835
and I honor our friendship,
and I honor our love.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.750
It would mean a lot to me
if we could run this mall

16:02.920 --> 16:04.660
and I could make love
to this hot woman

16:04.839 --> 16:06.650
and we could start a business
partnership together.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.154
I love it, but I've
got a big problem.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.499
I hate to do this to you here.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.697
I need to have an emergency
business meeting right now.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.116
Because guess what? We don't have
a name for our company yet.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.597
Shit.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.911
All right. What are we good at?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.266
Well, we're men who do business.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.581
We want to be business members.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.095
We're boys who do business.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.604
- Yeah.
- But...

16:25.359 --> 16:27.270
Eric. Look.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.695
It's a sign.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.697
"Doing business."

16:33.868 --> 16:36.826
Both: "Dobis."

16:36.996 --> 16:39.362
I love it. It's got a ring
to it, doesn't it?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.700
- Yeah.
- Dobis.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.582
"That's who we are."
We're dobis p.R.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.163
Dobis.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.421
- Look at that.
- Look at all the elements of business.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.424
- Look it. They're all there, Eric.
- Market research.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.428
- There's strategic p.R.
- Profit and loss.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.806
I'll have the report
to you by Monday.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.807
Man: I'll look forward to it.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.263
Guys,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.144
I told you, you should
never have fired me.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.976
Jim Joe, what do you want?

17:06.150 --> 17:09.313
I've got some poetry about regret
I'd like to share with you.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.487
Come on, Jim Joe.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.567
Friendship is warm,
friendship is touch.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.356
Jim Joe, please stop.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.867
We have to do this for ourselves.
We're sorry.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.403
- We've got to leave you behind.
- I'm sick, and I'm lost,

17:20.580 --> 17:21.861
and I'm tired
of floating around.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.490
We love you, Jim Joe.
We wish you the best.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.284
Let's go.

17:33.511 --> 17:37.345
J you cannot look behind you j

17:37.515 --> 17:39.597
j oh, no, you can't j

17:42.853 --> 17:47.142
j there's too much ahead
that excites you j

17:47.316 --> 17:49.147
j yes, thereis j

17:52.113 --> 17:56.732
j just like two horses j

17:56.909 --> 18:01.528

18:02.957 --> 18:05.915
j two horses j

18:06.085 --> 18:08.417
j running in the wind. J

18:13.551 --> 18:15.028
Hi, this is Tim and Eric.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.292
Sorry we're not here right now.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.073
We've left town to become
business members.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.177
We are now dobis.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.628
Please leave a message
for dobis.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.302
Be blessed.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.057
Shit.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.891
Son of a bitch.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.809
They just skipped town
on us, Tommy.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.730
- You find them.
- Mm-hmm.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.865
Find them if it's
the last thing you do.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.072
I want to drink their blood.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.988
- I want to take a knife and gut them!
- Yes.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.033
Oh, god, let me watch
their insides fall out.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.293
Yes. Yes. Yes. What else, Tommy?

18:53.841 --> 18:56.082
And let a bamboo tree grow
right up into their ass, huh?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.466
Yes.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.489
Until the tree grows straight
through their brains!

18:59.513 --> 19:02.505
Yes. And I will
deliver them unto you.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.765
I want to eat
their fucking hearts!

19:04.935 --> 19:06.095
Yeah!

19:06.270 --> 19:08.852
Yes. Yes. Yes.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.606
Okay. Tell me what you think.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.271
Uh, "dear Mr. weebs,

19:18.449 --> 19:22.112
we are very, very, very,
very excited to meet you.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.277
We are dobis."

19:24.455 --> 19:26.912
That's all I've got so far.
What do you think?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.290
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
I wasn't listening to you.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.872
I'm just so focused
on this ridiculous look.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.752
It's not working anymore.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.629
Let me take a look.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.459
It's just not right.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.116
You know what, Eric, if we're
going to be businessmen,

19:43.140 --> 19:45.847
I think maybe we should
look like businessmen, too.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.804
- I agree.
- Hold on a second.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.611
Now hold still.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.034
Goodbye.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.001
Oh!

21:57.233 --> 21:59.975
Good night, Katie.
I miss you, my sweets.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.612
Boy, you're really getting
attached to that photo, bud.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.569
Tim, it's not
just a picture, man.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.233
That could be
the girl of my dreams.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.011
All right. Let's just
try to stay focused

22:11.038 --> 22:12.278
on what's important here.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.788
Ever since I saw you
in that commercial, Katie,

22:14.959 --> 22:16.790
I felt this electricity
in my heart.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.293
I can't wait to meet you
and make love to you

22:19.463 --> 22:21.503
and go deep inside you
and show you my mushroom tip.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.419
All right, well,
I'm hitting the sack.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.685
Oh.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.309
Tim: What the hell?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.944
Okay.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.573
- Katie.
- Okay.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.983
All right.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.740
You want to finish
that in the bathroom?

22:57.918 --> 23:00.625
Almost done. Almost done.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.060
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
say good night, then.

23:30.910 --> 23:35.529
J just like two horses j

23:35.706 --> 23:40.496

24:01.315 --> 24:03.647
we've come a long way, Tim.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.497
We could turn around
right now if you want.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.189
No.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.069
I'm ready.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.901
All right. Let's go.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.498
Hello?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.585
Mr. weebs?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.986
Mr. weebs?

24:57.621 --> 25:00.533
Mr. weebs? Hello?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.865
- What? What the...
- Mr. weebs?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.291
Go to heck!

25:04.461 --> 25:06.076
- Whoa!
- Who is that, taquito?

25:06.255 --> 25:07.665
No, sir. It's dobis.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.580
- It's Tim and Eric.
- Tim and Eric.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.128
Oh.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.133
- Oh. Come in.
- Thank you.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.714
Yeah. Come in.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.881
- Tim and Eric. Hello.
- Hi. Sorry to spook you.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.801
- Good to meet you.
- Hi. Come in.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.311
Hi. Hi.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.063
I did not expect you guys.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.692
I don't usually have visitors
at this time of the day.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.148
So thank you.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.983
Please, sit down. Have a s...

25:34.158 --> 25:36.570
God! Come on!

25:36.744 --> 25:39.736
God damn it!
There's an order here.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.323
Sorry.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.160
Oh! All this was organized.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.541
Now, I don't know.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.876
Because a couple of dicks
walked in and wrecked it.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.665
- Can I help you?
- No!

25:52.843 --> 25:55.084
Have you ever visited
an office before?

25:55.262 --> 25:58.720
- You want us to come back another time?
- No.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.390
I almost had a heart attack.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.019
Can we have a fresh start?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.598
- That'd be great.
- Hi, I'm Eric wareheim.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.019
And I'm Tim heidecker.
And we are from dobis p.R.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.903
We saw your commercial,

26:15.074 --> 26:17.065
and we're here to run the mall

26:17.242 --> 26:18.482
and make that billion.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.321
Do you want to watch "top gun"?

26:21.663 --> 26:23.824
- Right now?
- I love that movie.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.615
- You have a copy?
- I have it here somewhere.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.251
There it is.
It was right here...

26:29.421 --> 26:30.821
- Right on top.
- The whole time.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.124
Okay. "Top gun."

26:32.299 --> 26:34.194
- Just put it in here?
- Just put it right in there.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.300
Great.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.301
Does it start from the top?

26:38.472 --> 26:40.383
Mm-hmm.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.797
"Top gun" from the top.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.802
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.721
- Tom Cruise, I guess.
- Mm-hmm.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.190
Damian: Ah. = Tim: Great.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.526
- Damian: I like that movie.
- Tim: It's a good movie.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.406
- Terrific.
- Wonderful. Artistic.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.114
Do you want to watch it again?

27:04.373 --> 27:06.238
We just saw
one pass of it, so...

27:06.416 --> 27:08.532
We'd love to focus
in on the business.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.917
It literally means
the world to me.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.832
Come on.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.487
I guess we can watch it
one more time.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.877
Yeah.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.792
- Rewind here?
- Rewind.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.757
So while we're rewinding,

27:21.932 --> 27:23.243
let's talk business
about the mall.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.507
And hit play.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.222
- Okay. Play again?
- Round two.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.229
- Play again.
- "Top gun" from the top again.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.607
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.444
Eric: I love that movie.
It's a great film.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.404
Great flying.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.786
Yeah.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.571
I love that music.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.285
Yeah.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.747
Yeah, the music is great.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.588
Not just the songs, either,
the score is good.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.794
- The motorcycles and stuff.
- Uh-huh.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.461
Is that val kilmer?
Is that val kilmer?

28:02.639 --> 28:05.096
Jesus.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.091
Fuck.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.306
Fuck.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.149
All right.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.529
Taquito!

28:20.699 --> 28:22.314
Get up here right now!

28:22.492 --> 28:24.198
I've got some business for you!

28:24.369 --> 28:26.781
I'll need to introduce
you to taquito.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.786
He lives here in the mall.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.410
He's a sick boy.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.917
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.418
Come here.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.508
He's your problem now.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.302
Okay.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.474
Also, you're going to have
to look out for the wolf.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.636
Is that a metaphorical wolf?

28:52.814 --> 28:55.772
- Huh?
- Like an animal wolf?

28:55.943 --> 28:57.604
- Yeah.
- You're talking about a wolf?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.269
Oh, yeah. He's a real wolf.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.028
He'll bite you.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.449
Noted. Okay.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.201
Well, if I could just move on?

29:08.372 --> 29:10.954
One more thing. I hate to do this
to you, but in the commercial,

29:11.124 --> 29:12.924
you said we were gonna
make a billion dollars.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.375
Oh. The money's coming.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.536
Did you wink there?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.830
- Hmm?
- You just winked.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.294
Look. Don't worry
about the money.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.006
You're gonna make a billion
running this place.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.387
Making the money.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.888
Yeah, it happened again.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.245
I'm sorry.
We're still seeing it.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.759
Really?

29:31.937 --> 29:34.053
I find that hard to believe.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.563
I saw a wink. That was a wink.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.473
I don't think I winked.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.314
Yeah. Well, we both saw it.
You winked.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.424
I don't know if it's some kind of
reflexive thing.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.448
No.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.216
Would you just mind
saying "Tim and Eric,

29:46.368 --> 29:48.930
you'll make the billion dollars,
run the mall," and there's no wink?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.946
I hate doing this, but could you just...
You know, even with your hands...

29:52.124 --> 29:53.910
- I'm happy to.
- Just keep them open.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.229
Then just say "Tim and Eric
will make a billion dollars."

29:56.253 --> 29:58.494
No wink.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.708
Just say the line
and keep the eyes wide open.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.918
You're gonna do just fine
running this place.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.129
You're gonna make a billion.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.386
Even with them spread,
I... we see the wink.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.888
I don't even know how
it's possible, but you're...

30:10.058 --> 30:12.390
- You're winking through it.
- Hmm.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.643
I think we should just
trust him on this.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.708
- I don't know, man.
- We don't have any other options.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.710
Wink or no wink, we have
to go with this. We're here.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.726
Okay. All right,
well, Mr. weebs,

30:21.903 --> 30:23.689
we'd love to accept the offer.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.446
- Oh, that's wonderful news.
- We'll run your mall.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.572
Great news.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.075
Yes, uncle Damian? What is it?

30:30.245 --> 30:31.451
Taquito!

30:33.498 --> 30:36.490
These are Tim and Eric.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.704
Oh, how nice.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.245
They will be running
the mall from now on.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.381
- You take orders from them.
- Yes, uncle Damian.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.337
Want to see where I live?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.797
Want to know where to get food?

30:48.972 --> 30:50.428
Taquito!

30:50.599 --> 30:53.306
You do the song
like we practiced.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.560
Yes, uncle Damian.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.392
J my name is taquito,
I live here in the mall j

30:59.566 --> 31:02.353
j I got left here
when I was really small

31:02.527 --> 31:05.018
j and then the mall closed,
and the wolves came to stay j

31:05.197 --> 31:06.482
j they raised me at first j

31:06.656 --> 31:07.976
j but now they chase me
all day j;

31:08.116 --> 31:09.401
j so stick with me j

31:09.576 --> 31:10.861
j I'll show you all the tricks j

31:11.036 --> 31:14.699
j but not too close,
or you may get sick. J

31:19.294 --> 31:21.376
sorry, I'm real sick.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.208
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.169
It's just the shivers.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.594
My body's hot, but I feel cold.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.011
Mr. weebs?

31:39.731 --> 31:43.019
Announcer: Tonight's movie features
several important lessons.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.230
The following segments
are meant to reinforce these themes.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.451
You wanted to see me?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.703
Yes. You're fired.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.740
Oh, no!

31:59.918 --> 32:01.749
Why? Why?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.036
That's it. Let it all out.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.830
Oh, no.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.920
This is the best
business scenario for us.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.380
It had to be done.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.716
Yes, you are right.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.426
I understand that now.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.467
Thank you. Good-bye.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.930
Psst. Wait.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.641
Come back.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.851
This is your severance package.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.840
Sweet old Mrs. wareheim.
Mrs. heidecker.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.591
Yes.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.093
You must be so proud
of your boys.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.380
Making a big Hollywood movie.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.423
Aren't you?

32:58.602 --> 33:01.469
The sets, the movie stars.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.934
Geez Louise,
it's something, isn't it?

33:06.276 --> 33:08.608
Well, you see, the problem is

33:08.778 --> 33:12.396
that they screwed up big-time.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.439
They screwed up, mommies.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.358
Oh, no.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.988
Are you scared?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.703
- Hmm?
- Scared?

33:23.877 --> 33:25.208
Where's your son?

33:25.378 --> 33:27.118
I don't know.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.662
Where are your sons?

33:30.550 --> 33:34.259
Where are your sons?
Where are your sons?

33:34.429 --> 33:35.635
Where is he?

33:37.265 --> 33:39.426
Earle. Let me try.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.976
You've got zaffer's music
over there on the right.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.984
Ahem. And that's
Dan's tiny baby outlet.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.816
He's only open two days a week.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.027
And this here
is drimble's yogurt.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.409
Some folks say it's haunted

33:59.579 --> 34:01.695
by the yogurt man.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.738
I don't know.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.499
I wouldn't change
too much around here.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.206
The yogurt man might
get real upset.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.463
That's a bobo.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.170
How are you?

34:14.344 --> 34:15.925
Hi.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.178
And this is Simon's.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.804
They sell things
for mommies and daddies.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.934
Oh, hey, Eric,
check it out. Swords.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.094
Eric: Cool, I love swords.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.686
Taquito: Mr. bishopman?

34:30.860 --> 34:33.021
I have a couple of fellas
who wanted to meet you.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.956
What's this? What do you want?
We're closing.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.571
I'm Tim heidecker.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.982
I'm Eric wareheim,
and we're from dobis p.R.,

34:39.159 --> 34:40.554
and we're here
to take over your mall.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.909
Tim:
That's right, Mr. bishopman.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.808
We are here to reimagine
what this mall can be,

34:43.831 --> 34:46.431
and, in fact, we got some pretty big
and exciting changes in mind.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.574
Mm-hmm.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.105
Eric: So just hand over
your cost report,

34:49.129 --> 34:51.290
and we'll get started on
some business plans for you.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.420
You listen to me.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.299
I'm Allen fucking bishopman,

34:56.469 --> 34:58.551
and I've run e z swords
for 15 years.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.587
And you want me to change?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.096
Fuck you!

35:02.267 --> 35:04.098
Sir, dobis is here
to help, okay?

35:04.269 --> 35:05.930
I like things this way.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.685
I don't want things to change!

35:07.856 --> 35:08.971
Okay.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.014
I sell two swords a year,
I'm good.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.899
I sell no swords a year,
and I'm even better.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.857
You see, s'wallow valley
wants to keep swords off the streets,

35:17.032 --> 35:20.570
and they pay me a monthly fee
to not sell any swords!

35:20.744 --> 35:21.779
Okay. I didn't know that.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.195
Well, now you do, you shit!

35:25.373 --> 35:26.909
Okay. Well, we didn't
know that. So...

35:27.083 --> 35:30.200
Well, now you do, you shit!

35:30.378 --> 35:31.993
Well, we weren't aware.
I'm sorry.

35:32.172 --> 35:36.256
Well, now you do,
you piece of shit.

35:36.426 --> 35:39.384
I got a lot of stuff
going around in my head.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.964
I've got to sort it out,

35:41.139 --> 35:42.629
and it will help to not have you

35:42.807 --> 35:45.014
right in my fucking face
the whole time!

35:45.185 --> 35:47.305
Well, we look forward to doing
business with you, sir.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.642
Yes. All the best.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.854
Good night.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.689
Anyways, there's a lot
of other fun stuff

36:00.867 --> 36:03.153
I'll show you tomorrow.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.944
Well, here we are.
Here's my humble abode

36:06.122 --> 36:09.080
and your temporary home
away from home.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.458
Okay. Careful.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.414
This is my secret tunnel.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.884
Well, here's the living room.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.425
Man:
Shut the fuck up, you little cunt!

36:28.603 --> 36:30.139
That's Roy.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.271
Don't look him in the eye.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.056
Hello.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.106
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Ah!

36:41.241 --> 36:44.324
Here we are.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.031
This is my little palace.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.161
This is where I sleep.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.122
If you have to do your business.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.167
There's no curtain.
You just close your eyes.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.003
If you have to do any work

37:01.177 --> 37:03.293
or any kind of calculations,

37:03.471 --> 37:05.757
you can...

37:05.932 --> 37:08.924
You can use
this machine I built.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.013
It's called the...

37:11.187 --> 37:14.350
It's called the taqutor.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.644
Eric's our numbers man here.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.273
I'm more of a managerial
type for dobis.

37:17.444 --> 37:18.796
Really looking forward
to crunching some numbers

37:18.820 --> 37:19.980
on that taqutor, taquito.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.693
Oh, yeah. You must be hungry.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.654
- We're fine.
- Here. Have a taquito.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.035
Ooh. No, thanks.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.366
You've got to keep those
refrigerated, taquito.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.782
I know. That's why
I only eat the middle.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.042
Taquito, don't put that
in your mouth, please.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.051
Taquito,
is everything all right?

37:49.225 --> 37:52.342
It's only blood.
It's just natural.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.646
I'm not meant to live long.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.766
Poor boy.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.189
All right. Well, on that note,

38:02.363 --> 38:03.694
we should probably hit the hay.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.230
Okay.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.195
- So...
- We can sleep right back there?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.700
Yep.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.946
- Good night.
- Sweet dreams.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.625
Good night, taquito.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.332
Good night.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.040
Yeah, awfully nice to have some company.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.549
Thanks, taquito.

Let's give a real big
warm welcome

40:06.487 --> 40:09.650
to our presidents
of dobis p.R...

40:09.824 --> 40:12.531
Tim and Eric!

40:14.078 --> 40:16.990
- Hey.
- Hey, everybody.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.405
Tim: Awesome.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.448
Eric: What is up, party people?

40:20.627 --> 40:22.492
Thank you.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.501
I'm Tim heidecker.
This is Eric wareheim.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.208
We are dobis p.R.,

40:26.382 --> 40:28.543
and we're here to tell you
about our plan

40:28.718 --> 40:30.238
to revitalize
the s'wallow valley mall.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.009
Boo!

40:32.180 --> 40:34.171
Tim: And here's how we're
gonna do it, guys.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.341
We're gonna use the three
keys to success.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.009
Eric: The first key to success.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.770
We gotta get rid of that wolf...

40:50.031 --> 40:51.271
That wolf.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.110
Tim: Okay, our second
key to success

40:53.284 --> 40:55.491
is we've got to clean
this mall up.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.119
All right? We've got to put a fresh coat
of paint on things.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.600
We've gotta get rid
of all you squatters.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.956
The third key to success

41:02.126 --> 41:04.162
is to prepare
for the grand re-opening

41:04.337 --> 41:06.419
of the new s'wallow valley mall.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.705
We've got to get rid of
the stores that don't work

41:08.883 --> 41:10.339
and bring in stores
that do work,

41:10.510 --> 41:11.750
that make profits.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.509
That's gonna do it for us, guys.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.887
And we're gonna be
making our billion.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.172
Eric: You got that right.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.744
Tim: I do want to add
a small caveat here.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.430
We have absolutely
no experience doing this kind of stuff.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.562
Absolutely not, guys.
We are Hollywood actors.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.723
Okay? That's our specialty.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.735
Re-opening a shit-hole mall?
It's not what we do.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.520
Yeah. We just want
to go on record here

41:32.699 --> 41:34.677
so nobody can come back
and this can't bite us in the ass

41:34.701 --> 41:36.428
that we didn't know what we
were doing here, okay?

41:36.452 --> 41:38.363
When I look in your face,
sir, I say to myself,

41:38.538 --> 41:40.369
I wish I stayed in Hollywood

41:40.540 --> 41:42.872
and just stayed
a superstar actor.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.078
What the fuck
am I doing down here

41:45.253 --> 41:47.494
doing business
in this shit-hole mall?

41:47.672 --> 41:50.084
- But that's dobis.
- That's the pride of dobis.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.249
Get used to it 'cause this place
is gonna change.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.088
Oh, yeah!

41:57.306 --> 41:59.171
Come on, everybody! Say dobis!

41:59.350 --> 42:01.306
- Dobis!
- Dobis!

42:01.477 --> 42:04.435
Talk about it, mama:
Dobis in the house.

42:04.605 --> 42:07.813
- Dobis!
- Dobis!

42:07.984 --> 42:09.144
Dobis!

42:15.783 --> 42:18.274
Got you just where I want you.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.865
There you are.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.451
Oh, you guys are going down.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.227
Excuse me. I was wondering
about this sword.

42:25.251 --> 42:28.038
Hang on. Can't you see
I'm on the fucking phone?

42:28.212 --> 42:29.577
Operator.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.542
Yes. Hello, operator.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.253
I need the number for
the schlaaang corporation.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.668
I have some information
they're gonna want to hear.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.323
Let me give you their
customer service...

42:38.347 --> 42:40.159
No, I don't want customer
service, you stupid bitch.

42:40.183 --> 42:43.016
I want you to put me through
to headquarters, goddamn it.

42:43.186 --> 42:45.518
H-hello?

42:45.688 --> 42:48.179
Oh, she hung up. Great.
She hung up.

42:48.357 --> 42:49.938
What the hell do you want?

42:51.486 --> 42:53.297
Oh, you're just holding
a knife out like I know...

42:53.321 --> 42:55.277
Oh, I know what to do with that.

42:55.448 --> 42:56.842
I just want to see how
much this sword was.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.903
Get the hell out of my store.

43:18.471 --> 43:19.927
Official dobis reps here,

43:20.098 --> 43:21.838
stopping in
for a meet-and-greet.

43:23.309 --> 43:26.392
Hi, welcome to Reggie's.
What can I get for you?

43:26.562 --> 43:28.018
We've got a sale
on slightly soiled.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.725
No, no, no. We're not customers.

43:29.899 --> 43:31.627
I don't know if you saw our presentation
we did the other day,

43:31.651 --> 43:34.393
but we're running things
here at the mall now.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.231
What exactly do you
sell here, Reggie?

43:36.405 --> 43:38.145
Oh, used toilet paper,
of course.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.157
There's a lot of demand
for that here, then, reg?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.033
It's more of
a gourmet operation.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.660
Okay. Write down gourm...

43:44.831 --> 43:46.571
I got it. G-i...

43:46.749 --> 43:48.489
No, g-o-r-m-a-y.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.124
Eric: G-0o-r...

43:50.294 --> 43:52.250
- M-a-y.
- M-a-y.

43:54.132 --> 43:58.341
Yep. Uh, every night, we go
out to the usual spots...

43:58.511 --> 44:01.093
You know, abandoned
port-a-potties, sewage mains,

44:01.264 --> 44:03.255
those kind of places...
And we do our collecting.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.844
And then we take
the messy slop back here,

44:06.018 --> 44:08.100
and we spool it all
onto new rolls.

44:08.271 --> 44:10.557
What's that? Shit?

44:11.607 --> 44:13.973
It's a shit smell. Is that you?

44:14.152 --> 44:15.562
It smells like po-po.

44:15.736 --> 44:18.603
My father taught me this
profession years ago.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.487
And now I'm teaching
it to my son.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.741
- Good.
- Speak of the devil.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.569
Come on.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.031
This is Jeffrey.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.666
- Say hello.
- Hi.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.327
Hello.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.004
Where have you been
hiding this boy?

44:37.175 --> 44:39.791
- That's not a bad boy.
- Come here.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.425
Let me feast my eyes
on that boy.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.211
Come here. Yeah.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.471
Take a look at you.

44:45.641 --> 44:46.972
Hey.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.220
Look at the size of him.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.056
Look at this.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.516
Hmm.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.147
Let me see your mouth.

44:55.318 --> 44:56.478
Nice. Nice teeth.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.860
You want to sit
on uncle Tim's lap?

45:00.031 --> 45:02.067
Get on my knee.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.197
I like your son a lot.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.029
All right, all right, Tim.

45:06.204 --> 45:08.195
Listen, Reggie, after
a few calculations here,

45:08.372 --> 45:11.159
it looks like your store isn't quite fit
for the new dobis brand.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.575
Sorry, reg. We're gonna
have to shut this boy down.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.164
It's been in
the family for years.

45:16.339 --> 45:19.502
The new s'wallow valley mall
is about fresh, clean, safe...

45:19.675 --> 45:20.960
You know what, Tim?

45:21.135 --> 45:23.171
There's an opening
for head of janitorial,

45:23.346 --> 45:25.177
and I don't know
Reggie's qualifications,

45:25.348 --> 45:26.825
but I feel like we could
give him a shot.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.259
What do you think?

45:28.434 --> 45:29.890
Uh, well...

45:30.061 --> 45:31.392
You do the dust.
You do the shine.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.052
We make a mess, you clean it up.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.893
- That's the job.
- Okay.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.682
Great. Well, reg,

45:37.860 --> 45:40.130
it sounds like you're gonna be pretty
busy over the next few weeks.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.815
Jeffrey, how about you
tag along with us?

45:41.989 --> 45:43.258
And I can teach you
a little bit about

45:43.282 --> 45:45.273
what it's like to be
a businessman around here,

45:45.451 --> 45:47.112
what it's like to be a real man.

45:47.286 --> 45:50.904
What it's like to be a real
successful businessman.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.288
Huh? Sound good?

45:52.458 --> 45:54.414
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.792
Why don't you call me daddy?
Say "yes, daddy."

45:56.963 --> 45:58.248
Yes, daddy.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.708
Does that sound good
to you, uncle reg?

46:00.883 --> 46:03.124
Yeah. Okay.

46:03.302 --> 46:06.465
Are you gonna be my son?
That's what I thought.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.789
Attention, squatters.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.423
This is your final warning.

46:44.593 --> 46:46.800
Please vacate the mall
immediately.

46:46.971 --> 46:50.008
This is a direct order
from dobis p.R.

46:53.436 --> 46:54.721
Get out of here.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.580
Swing, swing, swing.
Swing, swing.

47:16.751 --> 47:17.786
Oh, shit.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.200
You got, like, a foot back here

47:19.337 --> 47:20.668
if you swing it hard enough.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.788
I got it. I got it.

47:23.966 --> 47:26.048
Back it up.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.677
Get out and push.
Get out and push.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.937
Hey! I'm trying to work in here.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.610
All right. Shrim alternative
healing center.

47:46.781 --> 47:48.461
It looks like they have
a video here, guys.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.648
Tim:
You want to watch a movie, son?

47:50.826 --> 47:51.906
Good day.

47:52.078 --> 47:53.409
I'm Dr. doone strutts.

47:53.579 --> 47:55.490
And I want to thank you
for choosing

47:55.664 --> 47:57.905
the shrim alternative
healing center.

47:58.084 --> 47:59.665
Shrim.

47:59.835 --> 48:01.826
Shrim can help you achieve

48:02.004 --> 48:03.710
premium body health.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.543
Shrim.

48:10.054 --> 48:11.169
Ooh.

48:11.347 --> 48:14.089
You must locate
your inner shrim.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.803
Shrim begin.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.553
I will help you find your shrim,

48:21.732 --> 48:23.188
along with my sons.

48:23.359 --> 48:26.476
- Shrim!
- Shrim!

48:26.654 --> 48:28.986
Shrim.

48:30.783 --> 48:33.399
Shrim!

48:34.995 --> 48:36.906
Shrim!

48:37.081 --> 48:38.116
Shrim!

48:38.290 --> 48:39.905
I'd really like to get
my shrim tested,

48:40.084 --> 48:41.369
meet Dr. doone.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.626
Shrim. Sounds like shrimp.

48:43.796 --> 48:45.912
Shrimp sounds like shemp.

48:46.090 --> 48:49.378
Shrim. We should get
some shrimp for dinner.

48:49.552 --> 48:50.667
What?

48:50.845 --> 48:52.085
Shrim! Shrim! Shrim!

48:52.263 --> 48:54.800
Shrim!

49:02.898 --> 49:05.605
All right, Katie's
celebrity balloons is our last stop.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.295
Looks like no one's home.
We can turn around.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.604
- No.
- Let's go back.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.895
Just play it cool.
Play it just like yourself.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.985
Just be natural.
Don't forget we're here for business.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.491
Let's do it.

49:18.164 --> 49:21.531
Jeffrey, stick with me.
Play with the balloons.

49:21.709 --> 49:23.870
Hello. Hi. Tim and Eric here.

49:24.044 --> 49:27.286
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi, I'm Tim heideck...

49:27.465 --> 49:29.251
Hey, I'm Eric wareheim.

49:29.425 --> 49:32.462
Businessmen here.
I'm so nervous.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.716
So, um, love you.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.378
- No.
- No?

49:35.556 --> 49:37.421
Tim: Just be yourself.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.306
Hi. Eric wareheim. I love you.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.684
- Mm. Start again. Pardon us.
- One, two, three.

49:41.854 --> 49:43.936
Hi, I'm Eric wareheim.
Very in love with you...

49:44.106 --> 49:45.346
- Okay.
- This is business.

49:45.524 --> 49:47.435
I'm trying to just say
the business thing.

49:47.610 --> 49:48.837
We won't be able
to use any of that.

49:48.861 --> 49:50.726
- Cut the love?
- Yeah.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.362
Hi, I'm Eric wareheim.
We're here from dobis.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.193
We're evaluating
your balloon stand.

49:55.367 --> 49:56.903
And I love you so much.

49:57.077 --> 49:59.068
All right.
Why don't you take two?

49:59.246 --> 50:01.988
Tsst. Tsst.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.124
Take five. I'll get this.
Hi. We're dobis.

50:05.294 --> 50:07.626
We're just walking around,
trying to get a lay of the land,

50:07.796 --> 50:10.233
figuring out what you guys
need, how we can make this mall better.

50:10.257 --> 50:12.418
Oh. I was in the audience.

50:12.593 --> 50:15.505
I saw your presentation.
You were wonderful.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.011
Thank you for coming
all this way to help us.

50:18.182 --> 50:21.049
These are super cool.
How do you even make them?

50:21.227 --> 50:22.558
Oh, thank you.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.093
Eric. Eric.

50:28.692 --> 50:33.061
Uh, so, Katie, I would love to schedule
an official dobis dinner

50:33.239 --> 50:34.649
to discuss your business model

50:34.823 --> 50:36.984
for your balloon store here.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.525
With both of you?
That would be great.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.568
Um, or just me.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.703
Um, Tim will probably
be busy with his son,

50:43.874 --> 50:45.994
so you and I can just kind
of go over all the details.

50:46.085 --> 50:48.041
Friday's no good.
Jeff's got a lot of homework.

50:48.212 --> 50:49.622
We're gonna concentrate on that.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.038
Oh. Okay, fine.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.298
Oh, yeah.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.800
Hey, Eric.

51:08.232 --> 51:09.893
Jeffrey!

51:12.903 --> 51:14.018
Jeff?

51:17.825 --> 51:19.156
I miss you, son.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.870
What are you working on
over there, bud?

51:33.048 --> 51:35.168
I'm just crunching some numbers
with the taqutor here,

51:35.342 --> 51:37.378
and we got a problem.

51:37.553 --> 51:38.918
What are you talking about?

51:39.096 --> 51:40.632
Come take a look at this.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.426
Taqutor,

51:43.601 --> 51:45.432
load up the dobis
presentation, please.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.594
See what I'm saying?
It doesn't add up.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.807
Eric, it's probably just
a bug in the mainframe.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.643
I'll have Jeffrey
run a diagnostic.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.461
We'll get it sorted out.
It's nothing to worry about.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.365
No. There's nothing wrong
with the taqutor, man.

51:55.446 --> 51:58.404
The numbers are right here.
There's no way we're making that bil.

51:58.574 --> 52:00.610
What are you saying?
That weebs lied to us?

52:00.784 --> 52:02.740
You know how stupid that sounds?

52:02.911 --> 52:04.492
You know what your problem is?

52:04.663 --> 52:07.905
Your head's in the clouds
thinking about Katie all the time.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.118
Let me ask you something.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.205
How many times did you
masturbate to her today?

52:12.379 --> 52:13.915
Like five or six.

52:14.089 --> 52:15.249
Five or six times,

52:15.424 --> 52:17.027
when you should have been
focused on the prize.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.461
You should be focused on this:

52:18.636 --> 52:20.342
Opening up the s'wallow
valley mall,

52:20.512 --> 52:23.219
making the "mooney," okay?
Not some dumb slut.

52:23.390 --> 52:25.472
Hey!

52:25.643 --> 52:28.510
Say what you want about my
calculations in the taqutor,

52:28.687 --> 52:30.143
but leave Katie out of this.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.158
May I have a bite of your apple?

53:02.554 --> 53:05.011
I wish I had a bigger bite.

53:05.182 --> 53:08.549
That bite was all mine
because I worked hard for it.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.389
Yep. I didn't deserve that bite.

53:11.563 --> 53:13.724
I should have worked harder.

53:19.988 --> 53:23.901
Schlaaang:
Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies.

53:25.911 --> 53:29.369
I'm a successful
businessman, ladies.

53:29.540 --> 53:33.374
I built the schlaaang empire
from the ground up.

53:33.544 --> 53:37.537
And if you think two idiots
can make a fool of me,

53:37.715 --> 53:41.048
then you've got a lot
to learn about business

53:41.218 --> 53:42.879
and the schlaaang way.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.298
Yes.

53:46.473 --> 53:48.384
I've had you here for days,

53:48.559 --> 53:51.050
and you've given me nothing.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.810
Cornell, could you untie
Mrs. wareheim, please?

54:00.404 --> 54:01.860
Yes.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.487
You see this?

54:04.658 --> 54:06.444
It's a letter opener.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.401
It was my grandpop's.

54:09.580 --> 54:12.367
Beautiful.

54:12.541 --> 54:16.250
He must have used it to open up
thousands of letters over the years,

54:16.420 --> 54:20.914
but it also settled
more than a few arguments.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.468
Do you want
to lose a finger, too?

54:26.638 --> 54:27.638
Where are your sons?

54:29.933 --> 54:31.828
If it would get your
billion dollars back to you.

54:31.852 --> 54:34.514
But I just don't think I know
where they did get to.

54:35.939 --> 54:39.431
Motherfucking Tim and Eric,
where did you go?

54:43.614 --> 54:45.570
J you are my son j

54:46.784 --> 54:49.776
j you're better than anyone j

54:49.953 --> 54:52.945
j you're just like
a shiny new toy j

54:53.123 --> 54:55.409
j you are my boy j

54:56.919 --> 54:59.786
j you are my son j

54:59.963 --> 55:01.453
j you're better than anyone. J

55:01.632 --> 55:04.544
- ahem. Excuse me.
- What?

55:04.718 --> 55:06.946
Sorry to interrupt, but do you want to
get back to dobis?

55:06.970 --> 55:08.881
Or do you want
to continue singing?

55:09.056 --> 55:11.923
Yeah. It's fine.
Just got lost in my music.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.842
Well, we've got
drimble's yogurt here.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.386
Uh, looks like the power's
been off for years,

55:17.564 --> 55:19.930
so we got a lot of spoiled
yogurt we gotta deal with.

55:20.108 --> 55:22.474
And, as you recall, taquito
gave us a little intel

55:22.653 --> 55:25.736
about a so-called yogurt man
that's haunting the premises.

55:25.906 --> 55:27.271
So dobo better investigo.

55:27.449 --> 55:29.485
Well, if there is a yogurt man
in there, Eric,

55:29.660 --> 55:31.901
then today he's getting
his eviction notice.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.493
Oh, god.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.502
The smell.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.877
Eric:
Yogurt man, are you in here?

55:47.177 --> 55:49.338
Hello?

55:49.513 --> 55:52.050
Yogurt man? Ohh!

56:04.570 --> 56:06.151
Yogurt man, stand down!

56:06.321 --> 56:09.028
The mall's haunted!

56:11.618 --> 56:14.234
Wait.

56:14.413 --> 56:16.074
Taquito?

56:25.883 --> 56:28.374
- Taquito.
- I'm sorry, guys.

56:28.552 --> 56:32.636
I just don't want
anything to change.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.637
Taquito, change is important.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.345
But that doesn't mean we're gonna
forget about our old friends.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.724
- 1 don't know.
- Hold on a second, taquito.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.407
Taquito, we just had
a dobis meeting,

56:54.578 --> 56:56.578
and we've decided to let you
run the mall fountain.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.078
Really?

57:02.252 --> 57:04.188
Not only do you have to get it working,
but you have to maintain it

57:04.212 --> 57:06.578
and keep track of
all the loose change.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.965
So I think taquito's gonna be
with us for quite some time.

57:10.135 --> 57:12.126
Thanks, guys.

57:12.304 --> 57:14.135
I'll do the best I can.

57:14.306 --> 57:17.264
I hope I don't kick
the bucket before I finish.

57:19.019 --> 57:22.728
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking cunt motherfuckers!

57:22.898 --> 57:25.105
I'll kill you, you goddamn...

57:25.275 --> 57:28.108
- Tim, how do I look?
- Take a peek.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.189
Well, well, well.

57:30.364 --> 57:32.855
- Sharp as a tack.
- I'm feeling pretty good.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.614
Big date tonight, huh?

57:34.785 --> 57:36.776
Yeah. I'm taking Katie
to inbreadables.

57:36.954 --> 57:37.989
That'll be nice.

57:38.163 --> 57:40.620
- I'm trying to impress her.
- Oh. Almost forgot.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.327
I got you a little
something here.

57:42.501 --> 57:45.493
- It's called a Spanish fly.
- What is it?

57:45.671 --> 57:46.831
Let's just say it'll enhance

57:47.005 --> 57:48.495
your lovemaking
experience tonight.

57:48.674 --> 57:49.959
I put this right in my ass?

57:50.133 --> 57:53.671
Mm, no. You put it orally.
Yeah, right in your mouth.

57:55.180 --> 57:56.670
Did you swallow it?

57:57.891 --> 58:00.348
Come on, swallow it.

58:00.519 --> 58:04.182
- Perfect.
- Didn't go in.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.642
Come on. Swallow it.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.650
Mmm.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.481
Well, you better
hit the road, then.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.566
Okay. Wish me luck, bud.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.822
I guess I'll just stay here
and work on dobis.

58:15.993 --> 58:17.779
Keep my eye on the prize.

58:17.953 --> 58:20.695
Good luck with the pills.
Good luck.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.539
Man: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.747
This is James quall
here to talk about bread,

58:27.921 --> 58:30.833
and one thing I'd have to say

58:31.008 --> 58:34.842
is that I'd rather be
saying all these bread lines

58:35.012 --> 58:36.172
than standing in one.

58:38.890 --> 58:42.257
Ah, yes. One thing
that might be a hazard

58:42.436 --> 58:43.846
about talking about bread

58:44.021 --> 58:48.185
is they might accuse one
of being a loafer.

58:49.651 --> 58:51.312
Now I've just
come from Hollywood,

58:51.486 --> 58:55.024
where they have all these
famous personalities

58:55.198 --> 58:58.190
like bread pitt
and Robert breadford.

59:01.413 --> 59:03.074
And now...

59:03.248 --> 59:05.705
I'll be "baguette"

59:05.876 --> 59:07.912
in 20 minutes.

59:08.086 --> 59:10.122
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.255
I love this place.

59:17.429 --> 59:18.919
I know what you mean.

59:19.097 --> 59:21.713
- You want some of this bread slop?
- I'd love some.

59:28.231 --> 59:30.392
Mmm.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.899
This is so good.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.573
This is a funky place.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.896
So you were telling me
about your mom.

59:48.043 --> 59:51.376
Oh. Well, my mother calls
every Saturday night, right?

59:51.546 --> 59:54.709
It's like she's just calling
to see if I have a date.

59:54.883 --> 59:57.249
- So she doesn't just call...
- Ohh!

59:57.427 --> 59:58.758
Are you okay, honey?

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.732
Is it getting hot in here?

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:16.643
I don't think so.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.445
I'm just feeling really weird.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.649
Are you okay, honey?

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.488
There's so much
fucking bread here.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:32.000
Fuck. Fuck. Ohh!

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.580
Isn't it hot in here, Katie?

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:36.246
Little something
called Spanish fly.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.289
Eric, are you okay?

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.459
I have way too many
teeth in my mouth!

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.593
You might need some help.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.715
- Hi, how are you?
- No!

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.806
What?

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.142
Sorry, Eric, there's nothing
I can do for you now.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.477
What the fuck is that?

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.464
I'm gonna take you
to the shrim healing center.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.757
Come on.
You'll feel much better.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.737
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry, everyone.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.274
Shrim!

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.990
Come on in, my son.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:11.032
Dr. doone has you now,

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.872
and he's going to make you
feel all better.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.832
- Where am 1?
- Shh.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.248
Quiet, my boy.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:23.715
You need the healing
powers of shrim.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.129
I can sense that.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.717
Okay.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:28.883
You're in a very bad place.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.021
Now drop those pants.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.940
Shrim!

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.503
How was your date?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.923
Not so good.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.208
Eric got sick.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.719
Aw. That's too bad.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.131
It must be really unsatisfying.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.721
Yeah. It was.

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.897
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:22.523
- Yeah. I suppose.
- I'm so nervous.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.107
Listen.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.150
Want to go inside?

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.654
Okay.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.618
Are you sure?

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.125
No.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:40.287
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.753
Step into the tub, my son.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.544
That's it. That's it.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:51.089
Everything's going to be
okay, Eric, my boy.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.429
Dr. doone has got you,

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:57.346
and he's going to give you
a nice warm shrim bath.

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:59.640
- What?
- All my boys have been

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.935
hiding the shrim
inside them for days now,

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.025
and they're excited
to finally let it out all over you.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.781
- What boys?
- Come, my sons.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.318
It's time.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:14.112
Oh, look at them.
They can barely hold it in.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.289
Boys: Shrim.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.621
Shrim.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:23.084
Shrim. Shrim.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.133
Yeah.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.351
Boys: Shrim.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.861
Shrim.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.818
Shrim.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.482
Shrim.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.536
- Ohh!
- Shrim.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.994
Shrim.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.832
My boys only eat
the finest, softest meat

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:06.169
so that they can
achieve a level of shrim

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:07.958
that's unmatched.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:11.003
Shrim. Shrim.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.407
Oh!

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.451
Let the brown,

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.912
foamy mess wash all over you.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.682
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.893
Shrim, shrim.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.537
This is the power of shrim!

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:45.851
Jeffrey?

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.561
Is that you, boy?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.991
What are you doing, Jeffrey?

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.194
Where's papa Tim?

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.704
Is he inside?

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.119
Where are you going?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.084
Hello?

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.591
What the fuck.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.054
- Shit.
- What's going on?

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.873
Eric, don't do anything
stupid here, buddy.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.979
I should go.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.231
Katie. How could
you do this to me?

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.437
- Eric, I'm so sorry.
- Hey, stop.

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.819
You listen to me.
I saved you from her.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.605
She was nothing but dead weight, Eric.
She was making you soft.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.490
- She was not making me soft.
- She was making you soft.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.367
She wasn't making me soft.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.699
She was making you soft!

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.990
She was making me hard.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.370
Rock hard.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.078
Sometimes, when you're writing,

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.497
you just look for opportunities
to create moments

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.875
that take you out of the scene

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.341
and just add... add a joke.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.470
The jag was that we were
doing "soft, soft, soft"

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.847
and sort of out of
nowhere we go "hard."

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.973
Boom! Laugh.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:04.600
We fought for a laugh track,

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.558
and they said, "no,
this is a feature film for the theaters.

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.189
A laugh track wouldn't
make any sense."

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.271
Think about it.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.561
Eric, she was making you soft.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.343
She's taken your eyes off the game,
Eric, okay? We're here for dobis.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.136
What did you give me?
That wasn't Spanish fly.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.866
I played the oldest trick
in the book.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.403
But I had to play it 'cause
I needed to save my friend.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:24.991
You poisoned me.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.124
- What else could I do?
- You son of a bitch.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.673
Motherfucker!

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:41.212
How could you do that?

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.673
No! No!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:47.977
Jim Joe: Guys!

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.649
- Jim Joe?
- Why are you fighting? Stop fighting.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.981
Don't you remember
my poem about peace?

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.883
If you don't remember,
I'll recite it for you.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.694
- Jim Joe!
- P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:02.404
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.410
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.745
Come on. Yeah, yeah.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.962
Aah!

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.769
Like that?

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:33.768
Ohh!

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:36.518
You want some of this?

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.112
Oh!

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.453
Aah!

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.912
Why are you fighting?

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.886
Motherfucker!

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.975
No! No! Aah! Ohh!

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.439
Say you're sorry!

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.822
- I'm sorry!
- Say you're sorry!

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.323
- I'm sorry!
- Say you're sorry!

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.032
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.162
- Okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry for everything!

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.198
I'm sorry I poisoned you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.207
No, no, no, no.
Listen, I'm sorry, man.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.291
I'm sorry.
You were looking out for me.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.081
You were looking out for us
and the whole dobis thing.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.590
I know that now.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.251
I'm glad you finally
see it that way

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.885
'cause I'm just trying to help.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:48.423
Yeah. I just have to
ask you one question.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.058
Why'd you have to sleep with Katie?
You know I love her.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:54.220
Well, to be honest with you,
the plan made me horny.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.606
I had to empty my ball sack
into something.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:01.231
That moist hole
must have felt so good.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.363
Boy, you really do
love her, don't you?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.070
I really do.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.576
It's not gonna bother you
when you're making love to her

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.111
that my wick got
inside that hole?

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:12.120
Not at all, man.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.952
There's something
special about it,

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:15.867
you being deep inside like that.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.541
Well, then, it will be an honor
to be your best man.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.677
Come on down
to the grand re-opening

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.179
of the s'wallow valley mall.

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:30.035
I'll be there. My best friend
Tim heidecker will be there.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.537
I think you're gonna
like what you see.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.038
Ooh, you're gonna like
the fake trees.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.702
Ooh, you're gonna like
all our new stores.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.732
Ooh, you're gonna like
meeting my new son Jeffrey.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.711
My best friend Tim and I redid this
whole mall for you.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.770
You got to come down.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:41.130
It isn't gonna kill you.
Come on down.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.965
- It's for dobis' sake!
- I'm gonna murder myself

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.789
if you don't come down
to my new fucking mall.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:50.846
Come on down to the grand re-opening
of the s'wallow valley mall.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.673
My dad told me this is
the coolest mall ever.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.144
You think you know more than my dad?
Don't fucking come, then.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.979
It's the grand re-opening
of the s'wallow valley mall.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:11:00.291
It's just off route 35
right here in historic s'wallow valley.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.250
Where did you get that?

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.635
This guy named bishopman.
He sends this to me.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.262
He's been filling up
my voice-mail box for weeks

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.843
with crazy rants
about these guys.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.428
But look at this.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.594
We got them, Tommy. We got them.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.388
Earle, gather the men.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.683
We found your boys.
We're gonna go get them.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.307
All right.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.218
Listen, guys,
on behalf of dobis,

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.352
I want to say thank you
for all your hard work

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.310
in getting this mall
back in shape.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.924
And I gotta say
something personally.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.350
We're all very proud of you.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:05.735
Guys, tomorrow is our big day,

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.987
and dobis couldn't be
more jazzed about it.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.797
But right now I want
to have a little fun,

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:11.782
with the permission
of my best friend Tim.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:14.160
Muyo permissiono granted.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.790
Taquito,
would you do the honors?

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.668
Here goes nothing.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:25.379
On three, everybody.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.838
All: One, two, three!

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.342
Taquito.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.516
It's wonderful.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.345
Eric: It's gorgeous, taquito.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.306
I worked really hard on it.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.347
- We should make a wish.
- I love it.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.937
Oh, dobis, I wish
for this grand re-opening

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:47.193
to be the greatest grand
re-opening of all time.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.319
I wish that Tim heidecker
remains my best friend

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.856
- and I get to marry Katie soon.
- Hmm.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.907
I forgot about that wolf.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.870
I know what to do.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:08.380
I will need some duct tape
and some pizza.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.182
Eric, I don't feel
good about this.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.975
Taquito, be careful.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.111
Mama wolf!

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.362
Taquito.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.445
I have some nice pizza for you.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.736
Remember when we had pizza?

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:46.370
Hi, mama wolf.
Remember your baby boy?

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:52.296
I have to ask you
a little favor.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.094
It's time to go back to the...

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.603
Taquito!

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.778
He's gone.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.406
Must have snapped that
neck on the way down.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.942
- He saved the mall.
- Tell you what, taquito.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.723
We're going to change
the name of the pizza court

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.183
to the taquito court,
do you hear me?

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.413
Goodbye, boy.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.574
I miss the shit
out of him already.

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.287
- Taquito!
- Mr. weebs?

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.751
What are you doing here?

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:34.759
I could sense my boy
taquito was in trouble.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:36.635
It's too late.
He's already dead.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.671
He sacrificed his body
for the mall.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.055
He's gone.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.888
Taquito.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:45.223
He's alive.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:48.140
Uh, am I in heaven?

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.147
Taquito, you killed the wolf,
and you saved the mall.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.152
You did just what you
said you'd do.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.314
Uh, I did it.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.902
I killed the wolf.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.077
You did, my little boy.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.113
I'm so proud of you.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.703
I'm not gonna last long.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:09.835
I'm in a lot of pain.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:11.621
Oh, taquito.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:16.088
Would you like uncle Damian
to put some lead in you, son?

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:18.594
It's so cold down here.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.675
Put me to sleep forever.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.010
Oh, taquito.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.180
I can't watch him die twice.
I can't do it. Sorry.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:34.398
Taquito!

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.031
I'm still here.

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:44.028
Better try again.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.912
Okay.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.916
Taquito!

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.623
Now I can't feel my legs.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:54.209
It won't be long now.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.569
I can't take this.
Finish him off.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.379
Damn it, weebs,
shoot him in the face.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.214
No.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.674
I want my taquito to have
an open casket funeral.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:09.224
Ow. Ohh!

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.558
Come on, taquito.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.894
Just die, taquito. Come on.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:19.863
Any minute now.

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.525
Maybe I won't be sick in heaven.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.738
He's dead. Is he dead?

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.414
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.329
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, taquito. Thank you.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.674
That's it, then.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:54.098
A little to the left.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:57.313
Back a little bit.
That looks pretty good.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.944
- It's great.
- Yeah.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.606
You know what, Eric?
There's something I need to tell you.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.274
I think you may have been right.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.307
I did some numbers
crunching of my own,

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.286
and there's no way
we're going to make

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.993
a billion dollars
running this mall.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.000
I know. But you know what?
That doesn't matter anymore.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.377
It's not about the money.
It's about you and me.

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:17.664
It's about your new son.
It's about Katie.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.709
It's about the mall. I mean, we've
really made a difference here.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:23.753
You know what? They probably forgot
about that billion dollars anyway.

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:27.094
It's just a billion dollars.
Hee!

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:29.975
I love this fucking mall!
Come on.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.977
- To dobis.
- Hey, big news.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.981
You have just been made
dobis' employee of the month.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.937
I want to live in this
fucking mall forever.

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.396
Yeah.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.024
Forever?

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:48.764
Do you forgive me
for sleeping with Tim?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.029
I do.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.324
There he is.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.787
Ohh!

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.668
I hope you never leave.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.502
I guess we're gonna
be here forever.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.340
Look, dad, our first customers.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.112
Tim: I don't think those
are customers, son.

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.802
Let me take a look.

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:17.856
Shit. Schlaaang.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.483
They found us.

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:21.564
All right, everybody inside.
Come on.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:30.361
What's going on?

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:53.725
Listen up, Tim and Eric!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.932
We have you surrounded!

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:58.518
And if you don't come out
in 10 seconds,

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:02.310
I'm gonna come in there
and blow you to fucking hell!

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:05.571
Finally. Good luck, assholes.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:10.735
Ha ha ha! Hey, guys,
it's me... Allen.

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:14.531
I was the one who sent you the tape
telling you where to find Tim and Eric.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:17.040
Shit!

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:18.621
- Eric, look out!
- Oh, god!

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:24.127
Okay, okay, listen, maybe...
Maybe I overreacted.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.292
You think there's
some common ground here...

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.910
I like you-you like me
kind of thing?

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:30.592
Eric: Tim, we need
a dobis-sized idea stat!

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.722
Okay, hold on now.
Hold on. Let me think.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.475
- Come on! Think!
- Come on, Tim.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:38.683
- What's going on?
- Ah, I gotit.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.643
Reggie, hey, come on in.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.087
Come here, come here, come here.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.851
- How's everything?
- Good.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.190
Family good?

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.856
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:51.025
So, listen, we got
a little thing out here.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.431
It's not really a big deal. But if you'd
go out there and talk to them,

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.662
maybe knock some sense
into them, reg.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.698
- Nice.
- You're a reasonable man.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.867
They're reasonable men.
You could go out there

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.439
and tell them
to put their guns down.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.794
Would you do that for us, reg?

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.296
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it, do it.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.797
Dobis needs you, reg. Please.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.404
You'd be hitting it
out of the park for us

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.384
if you did it, reg.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:11.795
- I can do that.
- Will you do it? Oh, good. Thanks, reg.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:13.692
Why don't you go ahead
and do that now, then?

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:19.895
Dobis thanks you, reg.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:27.937
Hi.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:30.231
My name is Reggie.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.866
I think we should all
take a moment here

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:34.447
and reassess the situation

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:36.532
because there are a lot
of good people in there

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:39.039
and I would hate
to see any of them hurt.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.325
Fire!

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.618
No.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.599
How do you like that,
Tim and Eric?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.431
Huh? Ha! Ha!

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.186
Aah!

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:04.099
That didn't work. Sorry.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.267
We're doomed.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.027
What is that smell?

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.863
I pooped my pants.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:14.241
Oh, Allen, that's disgusting.

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.527
Look, I'm sorry that
I tattled on you two.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.036
I shouldn't have called.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.185
I just thought they were going to give
you a slap on the wrist.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:21.540
Smell's getting in my eyes.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.416
Wait a second. I have an idea.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.043
Allen, you go back to your store

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.691
and bring as many swords
as you can carry.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.797
Okay.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.668
You're all gonna die in there!

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:42.197
Here you go, guys.
As many as I could muster.

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:43.971
Thanks so much, Allen.
These are great.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:45.460
Oh, you're welcome.
You're welcome.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.020
Anything for you.
I am a team player.

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.355
- Oh. This one's nice.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.895
That's one of my favorite ones.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.155
I personally sharpened
that one... aah!

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:57.284
That's for betraying us, Allen!

01:21:57.454 --> 01:22:00.321
- Nice.
- Thanks, man.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.955
You know this is it.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.167
I know.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:08.249
I gotta say it's been
one hell of a ride.

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:11.291
- To dobis.
- To dobis.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:16.045
Katie, I have something
to say to you now.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:23.832
You know you're the love
of my life, right?

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.938
Yeah.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.770
Ever since I met you,
I wanted to consummate that love.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.357
I wanted to go deep inside
you without a condom

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.943
and explode in
your canal. Psssh.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.733
Grow a little baby up in there.

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:40.698
Start a family.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.285
So I have to ask you this
one important question.

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.587
Will you marry me?

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:52.543
Hey, Eric, where'd you
get that big diamond?

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:55.255
I got it on the "diamond Jim" set.
I got tons of them.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:56.948
Oh, yeah, I got a ton
of them diamonds, too.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.304
I got, like, a billion
dollars' worth of them.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.551
Will you make me
the happiest man on earth?

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.562
Yes, I do.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.348
- Katie!
- No.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.141
Nice shooting, Tommy.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.311
Really, really good.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:15.229
My love.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.988
No.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.997
Schlaaang!

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.783
Eric.

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.377
We doing this?

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.504
Hells, yeah.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.916
Ah, shit, come on.

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.635
Take them out!

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.740
Okay, listen, I need you
to do something for me.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.914
It's not going to be easy,
but I know you can do it

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.372
'cause you're my little boy.

01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:12.168
You're the best son I ever had.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.372
Hey, schlaaang!

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.051
Shoot the kid!

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:22.067
We did it.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:23.903
We did it, buddy.

01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:26.739
We really did it.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.741
Well, what did you think?

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:10.996
As Steven Spielberg,
I approve of this movie.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:14.909
And let me say this is the greatest
film of all time.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.749
- Yeah.
- Both: Let's celebrate.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:22.332
Yay!

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:30.632

We did it. You understand me?
We fucking did it!

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:04.477
Tim and Eric have taken
my part away from me

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.315
like garry Marshall did to me

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.446
back with "Laverne and Shirley"
and "happy days"

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.482
when they chose
Robin Williams over me.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:17.573
Hi. We're Tim and Eric.
I'm Tim heidecker.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.208
