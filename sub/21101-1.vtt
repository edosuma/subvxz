00:48.215 --> 00:50.425
<i>Mmm! I whispered, "I am too young"</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:52.679
And then "I am old enough"

00:52.762 --> 00:54.471
Wherefore I threw a brown penny

00:54.556 --> 00:56.473
- to find out if I might love
- Who is that?

00:58.017 --> 01:00.645
- That is Yates.
- Who the fuck is Yates?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.648
Oh, just a minor Irish poet...

01:03.731 --> 01:05.817
Whoever the fuck that is.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.402
Your ignorance is so infectious!

01:12.991 --> 01:16.578
<i>Oh, wait a minute...</i>

01:16.661 --> 01:18.955
Oh, my dear lord...

01:19.038 --> 01:21.749
Oh, Hannah, my love...

01:21.833 --> 01:23.166
Well done!

01:23.250 --> 01:25.795
Keep going.
I want to hear the rest of the poem.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.589
<i>Love is the wicked thing...</i>

01:38.808 --> 01:41.393
There is no one wise enough to find it out

01:41.476 --> 01:45.898
For he would be thinking of love
till the stars had run from the sky

01:45.982 --> 01:46.982
Disgusting.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.111
- On his bowl.
- Hey, do you want some of this?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.280
Well, I'll try anything twice.

02:43.665 --> 02:46.000
- There you go. Keep the change.
- OK, thank you.

02:48.086 --> 02:50.420
- Fenton Dillane, my man!
- Irving, how are you?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.923
Good.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.763
How's the family? Baby Lou?

03:00.932 --> 03:02.850
Baby Lou ain't a baby no more.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.686
She's a three-year-old wrecking ball.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.690
That Cali sun got you soft.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.900
It's not that sunny in San Francisco.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.192
No?

03:12.902 --> 03:14.444
Don't tell me you're a Nets fan now...

03:14.528 --> 03:16.613
Come on, man, Knicks for life!

03:16.698 --> 03:18.700
I gotta give Phil some time to build.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.055
Man, it's really great seeing you.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.413
Hey, man, good seeing you too.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.040
Don't be away so long, OK?

03:26.791 --> 03:28.071
- I got it from here.
- You sure?

03:28.126 --> 03:29.376
Yeah.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.342
- Very pungent.
- That means it's dead.

03:42.932 --> 03:45.392
- Mom?
- All right.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.728
Oh, it's Fenton.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.397
Fenton, this is a surprise.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.025
Wasn't expecting...
You're home!

03:55.737 --> 03:57.362
Yeah. New me.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.572
What's up, buddy?

03:58.655 --> 03:59.531
John.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.952
Thank you... John.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.914
Didn't think I wanted to be home for...
the latest?

04:06.998 --> 04:09.666
I wasn't sure.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.546
Oh, shoot, the sea bass.

04:15.006 --> 04:18.091
If someone's near the oven
would you shut it off?

04:18.176 --> 04:19.844
It's good, man?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.429
Things good in San Fran?

04:22.512 --> 04:25.099
Haven't seen you in, what, a year?

04:25.183 --> 04:26.433
- Yeah. I guess.
- Yeah.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.936
Were you just selling my mom weed?

04:29.020 --> 04:30.855
Oh, strictly at cost.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.272
She... she smokes weed?

04:32.355 --> 04:33.900
Oh, yeah...

04:33.983 --> 04:36.359
No... not a lot.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.945
Sometimes.

04:39.197 --> 04:42.033
Listen, The Georgian's having people
over tomorrow night.

04:42.116 --> 04:45.203
- Good old Georgian party.
- Yeah.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.497
Fenton, come say hi to your sister,
and there's someone I want you to meet.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.332
Be right there.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.923
Well, well, well...

04:57.006 --> 04:58.507
Layla.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.759
Welcome home, brother.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.972
Fenton, this is my friend, Ahmed.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.351
- Nice to meet you.
- OK. Hello.

05:10.144 --> 05:13.480
Layla, would you be a dear and,
open another bottle of wine?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.482
Oh, yeah. I'm on it.

05:20.238 --> 05:21.864
Layla, let me,
give you a hand with that.

05:21.948 --> 05:23.615
I can...

05:27.619 --> 05:28.830
What is going on?

05:28.913 --> 05:31.040
- What?
- I mean who is he?

05:31.123 --> 05:32.707
He's a friend of Mom's.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.879
They met at a Studies of The Far East
group at the Met.

05:36.963 --> 05:41.300
So, what, they go to museums, they look at
ceramics from the Khyber Pass, like...?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.930
If his presence is so offensive to you,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.640
just give notice the next time
you feel like visiting.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.434
Wow.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.145
- Are they like...
- Fucking?

05:53.229 --> 05:54.981
Jesus, Layla!

05:55.064 --> 05:56.899
I hope so.

05:56.983 --> 05:59.193
But Mom's not Dad,
so I wouldn't count on it.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.908
It's big of you to come home for this.

06:07.243 --> 06:08.702
Back for what?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.706
You tell me.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.959
What, back for Dad?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.089
I wrote something I'm not sure
I want to publish.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.716
What's going on, Fenton?

06:28.097 --> 06:30.057
It doesn't work like that.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.642
You don't get to leave the way you did

06:32.726 --> 06:35.478
and then come back
and expect everything to be OK.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.566
Because you just left, for a long time.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.880
You would too if every New York asshole
with a blog or a column

06:42.904 --> 06:46.489
was comparing you to bags of douche
or Alec fucking Baldwin.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.911
They're just reacting to the what, Fenton,
not the who.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.664
If you ever leave like that again...

06:55.832 --> 06:57.584
I'm gonna kill you.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.546
Seriously. I'm gonna kill you.

07:02.924 --> 07:05.508
OK. Never again.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.345
I promise.

07:15.937 --> 07:20.024
Layla, what are you...
studying in college?

07:21.400 --> 07:22.484
Lots of stuff.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.613
Really, just a four year delay
to my unemployment.

07:27.239 --> 07:31.410
Lay, are you still,
dating that guy with the... red hair?

07:31.493 --> 07:32.744
What was his name, Dick?

07:32.827 --> 07:35.414
He had braces, yeah? And a mullet.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.457
- A mullet?
- Fuck both of you.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.709
And who are you dating right now?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.503
I came back for Jessie.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.631
Fenton...

07:46.050 --> 07:50.929
why don't we smoke some of this
lovely, purple marijuana

07:51.013 --> 07:52.264
that you brought, John?

07:52.348 --> 07:54.141
- Mom...
- What?

07:54.225 --> 07:56.685
You walked in on the deal.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.983
Regardless, you can take pride in the fact
that this is some excellent shit.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.275
Yeah.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.194
I'll get it.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.117
Hello?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.910
Really?

08:13.995 --> 08:16.122
We're eating dinner, you cocksucker!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.292
Which cocksucker was that?

08:20.376 --> 08:23.097
It was another one of those reporters
asking if I had anything to say

08:23.129 --> 08:24.546
about my father.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.839
Happy you're back.

09:54.345 --> 09:57.389
Ma... are you...
You OK?

09:58.474 --> 10:00.642
Me? I'm fine.

10:02.561 --> 10:06.606
Oh, you mean the... marijuana.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.443
It helps me... relax.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.491
I wasn't talking about that.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.617
Oh.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.081
No, I was just... you know, about Dad.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.293
Him! It'll be fine.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.922
I was going to go see him tomorrow.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.425
That's what you're back for.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.514
Yeah, sure. You know, for Pop.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.433
I'm working on something...

10:42.100 --> 10:44.145
and could use his advice.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.814
It's good to have you home.

10:49.150 --> 10:51.485
You look... thin.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.682
So far, Fenton, these chapters...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.561
Wow! I mean...

11:25.644 --> 11:27.605
I mean, they're hilarious.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.609
I loved your story,<i> The Birthday Party.</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:34.361
Really? You know it forced me into exile.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.821
I'm serious.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.366
And this novel picks up
right where that left off.

11:39.450 --> 11:42.952
I feel like we know these people.
That they exist.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.332
And after the reception of the story,
it's totally marketable.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.542
Because we do it like one of those memoirs

11:48.626 --> 11:51.836
where we're not sure if what we're reading
really happened or not.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.131
But James, this is... this is fiction.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.716
Well, of course it is.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.429
Now, when do you think you'll be finished?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.421
You're home! Huh.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.590
Look at this.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.717
Front page.

12:39.593 --> 12:44.055
Of course, the turds weren't interested
when I won my National Book Award, but...

12:44.138 --> 12:46.267
Was that girl that was just here,

12:46.350 --> 12:48.142
was she from the car crash?

12:48.226 --> 12:50.061
Yeah.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.648
She's an excellent writer.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.695
Well, this should be a lesson
for you and your sister:

12:58.654 --> 13:01.155
Always wear seat belts.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.782
If I hadn't been wearing a seatbelt,

13:02.865 --> 13:06.035
you'd be standing
over a headstone right now.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.204
Why didn't you just leave Mom years ago?

13:08.289 --> 13:10.416
I can't leave your mother.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.875
She understands me.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.213
This is humiliating.

13:17.298 --> 13:19.717
Oh, I know. For all of us.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.176
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.138
Well, then again, maybe you do.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.223
This does contradict your public image.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.267
Well, not only that,

13:29.351 --> 13:33.522
the other girl's parents are suing me
and the university.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.403
All of these young girls
throwing themselves at me,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.530
you'd think your mother would understand...

13:41.613 --> 13:43.490
Keep it in your pants, Dad.
Don't blame Mom!

13:43.574 --> 13:45.409
No, no. I'm not blaming her.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.869
I'm just saying it's not all my fault.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.538
What the f...

13:49.621 --> 13:51.164
Are you writing?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.934
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about this publisher...

13:53.958 --> 13:57.713
By the way, those bastards were
just waiting to tear apart your story.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.838
They had it out for you.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.633
They wanted to tear your story apart
right from the beginning.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.969
It's just the way it is. Sons of bitches.

14:05.053 --> 14:08.599
Anyway, I'm glad you made it
down here for this.

14:08.682 --> 14:13.061
You've been off the radar
for quite a long time.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.065
I look good here.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.402
That's a damn good picture of me.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.670
I saw Dad today.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.551
Yeah, if we had any sense
we'd just leave him there to rot.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.473
Have you seen Dad cry?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.309
No. That's so random. Why?

14:55.103 --> 14:58.022
I don't know, just... just thinking.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.483
Well, you shouldn't.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.861
- We already know he's a fucking prick.
- Enough!

15:03.779 --> 15:05.321
Whatever.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.702
I'm going to The Georgian's tonight.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.871
You are?

15:12.954 --> 15:15.248
Yeah. He's having a party.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.916
Why don't you come?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.169
I thought you hated him?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.297
I do.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.967
What?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.261
Nothing.

16:21.482 --> 16:25.443
- That is how we fucking do it in Tbilisi.
- Where's that?

16:25.527 --> 16:27.195
Georgia.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.864
The Republic of Georgia.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.491
Oh, my cousin went to Georgia Tech.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.910
No, listen, where Joseph Stalin is from.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.912
Where the original Santa Claus is from.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.581
Where the most beautiful food
in the world...

16:38.832 --> 16:39.917
What the fuck?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.586
Yo, holy shit! Fenton!

16:44.253 --> 16:45.881
When'd you get back in fucking town?

16:45.964 --> 16:48.341
- Yesterday.
- Oh, my God, it's been a long time!

16:48.424 --> 16:51.219
- Yo, how are you holding up?
- Oh, man, I'm good.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.012
Your fucking dad though, huh?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.306
Man after my own heart though, huh?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.643
Fuck, Fenton!
Let's get a fucking drink.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.520
- Yes, please!
- Come on. Holy shit, Fenton!

16:59.603 --> 17:01.647
You got it.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.147
Can I just squeeze...

17:06.777 --> 17:08.277
Yeah, just...

17:09.487 --> 17:11.405
Nothing? All right.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.366
Hi. Can...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.786
OK. I'm trying to get a drink.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.119
- I see that.
- Maybe I'll just...

17:19.079 --> 17:20.999
No? OK.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.088
Hi. How are you doing?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.300
Johnny, what's up, man!

17:31.384 --> 17:33.094
What's up, dude? Good to see you.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.532
- Can you hook me up with some kind?
- Sorry, boss. I'm off-duty tonight.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.098
All right?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.976
Come on, man. Please.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.395
One-fifty.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.479
Dude...

17:43.564 --> 17:45.439
I'm opening up the chimney for you.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.568
One-fifty? Come on, man, I can't.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.735
Then, I can't help you.

17:48.819 --> 17:51.339
Have your parents put more money
in your checking account, yeah?

17:56.117 --> 17:58.357
- You want to help me out there, or...?
- No, not at all.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.732
- No?
- That was too fun to watch.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.539
Well, now I know what happens when a guy

18:01.623 --> 18:04.417
who can define a credit default swap
starts slinging dope.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.880
It's pretty impressive.
All in the game, yo.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.933
- Hey.
- O.M.M.G!

18:20.017 --> 18:22.268
- Layla.
- The Georgian.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.477
Hi.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.480
- My goodness, you've grown!
- All right, all right.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.275
You're still throwing the best parties
in New York. Congratulations.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.079
Thank you. Look at you,
you're all grown up.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.403
Yeah, it happens.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.781
What are you drinking?
I'll get you something special.

18:34.865 --> 18:35.866
Don't roofie my sister.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.619
Are you kidding me? She's like
my little baby sister, this one.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.787
Gross.

18:40.871 --> 18:43.331
- Hey! John, have a drink.
- All right.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.000
Have a drink... But tell me,

18:45.083 --> 18:47.519
what is your dad gonna do now that
everyone is calling him a fraud?

18:47.543 --> 18:51.464
Same thing I did when this town called me
a fraud. He's gonna leave.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.424
He's not that much of an asshole.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.303
Dad gets dizzy crossing the Washington
Bridge. He's not going anywhere.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.747
- He's a genius, your dad. A genius.
- You would think that.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.808
Pops is like Charlie Sheen with a PHD.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.151
Oh shit...

19:22.328 --> 19:23.454
Shit!

19:23.537 --> 19:24.537
This is bad.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.293
Excuse me. Sorry.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.420
Jess, hey.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.757
I've got nothing to say to you.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.801
Oh, I'll do the talking then. Listen...

19:35.884 --> 19:37.928
Great, I'll be doing the leaving.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.387
Jessie.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.140
Jessie, wait. Jess...

19:42.891 --> 19:44.392
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.937
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry.

19:47.020 --> 19:47.938
Hey. Hey!

19:48.021 --> 19:49.480
God, would you stop following me?!

19:49.563 --> 19:51.232
- Give me a break!
- Give you a break?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.026
For what? Leaving?

19:53.110 --> 19:55.277
Or for writing that fucking story?

19:55.528 --> 19:58.197
You know, my parents didn't talk
for months after that.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.993
Hey, you guys, you have to be really
careful what you say around this guy,

20:02.077 --> 20:05.246
because you never know
what's going to end up in print.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.082
- Asshole.
- Jessie...

20:07.833 --> 20:09.583
Jessie...

20:09.667 --> 20:11.252
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.713
What do you want?

20:12.796 --> 20:14.672
Don't you think we should talk?

20:14.756 --> 20:16.465
Now?!

20:16.549 --> 20:18.342
We could go somewhere else.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.303
Wow... You are unbelievable.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.103
- That's a big ring.
- You didn't get the invite?

20:29.187 --> 20:30.396
"The invite"?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.481
I invited you to hurt you.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.112
There you go again, love.
Chatting with good-looking strangers.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.572
Victor, this is Fenton.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.492
The... the infamous.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.330
Don't you live in California?

20:49.582 --> 20:50.582
Yeah. I'm back.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.253
- For us?
- No.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.298
No shit.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.925
How thoughtful.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.676
Promise to write nice things about it.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.365
I've never written a bad word
about a church in my life.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.599
How about a gallery?

21:08.726 --> 21:11.687
The wedding is at our gallery.

21:12.730 --> 21:13.982
Yeah.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.026
Yeah, right, right.
That was on the invite.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.822
Sweetie, we need to go. I promised
Matthew and Bjork we'd stop by.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.448
Maybe I'll stop by too.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.618
To the gallery, I mean.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.453
Check out some art.

21:27.536 --> 21:31.457
Well if you're serious about
contemporary art, please, come by anytime.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.168
Yeah, no, I'm serious about it.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.212
About contemporary art. I love it.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.006
- I'll definitely stop by.
- Great.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.176
Well it has to be before Saturday.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.719
OK.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.514
The wedding is this Saturday, Fenton.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.019
This...
Wait, this Saturday?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.064
It was on the invite.

21:57.984 --> 21:58.985
Good to meet you.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.311
Rough night?

22:36.314 --> 22:39.567
- Yeah.
- We have to leave soon.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.778
Your father wants us all there
when he's released from the hospital.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.908
I'm sure because he wants
to look good for the press.

22:46.992 --> 22:50.996
The... forgiving,
supportive family and all.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.915
Wouldn't want to spoil the illusion.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.008
Jessie sent me an invite to her wedding,
didn't she?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.802
What, you just weren't going to tell me?

23:07.845 --> 23:11.724
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?

23:11.807 --> 23:15.896
Because after the way you left,
I didn't... think you'd care.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.898
You didn't think I'd care?!

23:19.024 --> 23:21.151
- Let's do this another time.
- No, let's do this now.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.834
- No, we're going to be late.
- She's getting married on Saturday!

23:23.861 --> 23:25.989
And she deserves to be happy.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.739
What about me?

23:28.616 --> 23:29.867
What about you?

23:29.951 --> 23:31.286
I don't deserve to be happy, too?

23:32.162 --> 23:34.331
Of course, but not at her expense.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.082
What are you talking about?

23:36.166 --> 23:37.566
The way you wrote about her family,

23:37.625 --> 23:40.295
your relationship with her,
in that story was exploitive.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.546
It felt all too familiar.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.174
Mom, it was fiction.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.092
You, of all people,

23:46.176 --> 23:49.678
should know there's no such thing
as fiction. Just ask your father.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.683
Layla, we have to leave!

24:01.607 --> 24:04.526
Ah, the welcoming committee!

24:06.029 --> 24:07.488
Layla!

24:07.571 --> 24:09.907
- Hey, Dad.
- You look wonderful.

24:09.991 --> 24:12.785
Thanks. I did it just for you.

24:13.494 --> 24:16.538
Fenton, you look like shit.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.958
Good to see you too, Dad.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.708
Thank you for doing this.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.336
Happy family.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.837
And thank you both, too.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.506
We didn't really have a choice.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.467
Let's keep up appearances, darling,
at least until we get home.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.761
- OK.
- Oh, my phone!

24:30.844 --> 24:33.348
- Nope, I forgot my phone.
- I'll get it.

24:34.391 --> 24:36.642
Pamela, I can...

24:36.725 --> 24:38.560
I can manage on my crutches.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.981
Hospital protocol, Mr. Dillane.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.482
Protocol.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.383
How I've missed those hands.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.676
"I can't wait to have you in my mouth."

25:10.759 --> 25:11.969
Wow.

25:37.911 --> 25:41.291
- Anna!
- Is it so hard for you?

25:41.374 --> 25:43.209
- I don't understand.
- I have male friends.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.794
- Yes, I know.
- I'm not screwing them.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.505
- Well...
- And please, please...

25:47.588 --> 25:51.008
Please don't try to tell me that you're
ending up in the middle of Rebecca

25:51.092 --> 25:53.611
- or whoever as a bad reaction to Prozac.
- You've misinterpreted

25:53.635 --> 25:55.804
what exactly that text said...

25:58.891 --> 26:01.352
Anna, do you want to talk about this?

26:01.436 --> 26:03.476
Fenton, will you tell this guy
to slow down, please?

26:03.521 --> 26:05.291
I don't want to interrupt him.
He's on the phone.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.584
- Why don't you pay attention...
- Excuse me, sir.

26:07.608 --> 26:11.028
- Do you mind slowing down a little?
- Annabel, listen...

26:11.112 --> 26:13.989
Hey, why don't you hang up the phone
and fucking drive?!

26:14.074 --> 26:15.616
- Don't piss him off.
- Shut up!

26:15.699 --> 26:20.788
I have no control over this girl,
she's very young and impressionable.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.124
- Clearly.
- Please...

26:23.208 --> 26:26.336
Must be your prowess
in between the sheets.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.421
Though it's been so long,
I don't really remember.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.277
You know it's illegal to talk on the phone
and drive at the same time, right?

26:33.301 --> 26:35.428
No, not illegal. Bluetooth.

26:35.512 --> 26:37.388
- Hands free, see?
- Look out!

26:37.472 --> 26:40.015
- Watch it!
- Watch the road, yutz!

26:40.100 --> 26:43.478
- Be civil. You wanted a united front.
- I never said that...

26:43.561 --> 26:46.605
- You always said that!
- All right, let's not go there.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.942
Ever since you dragged us
to that Hamptons party two summers ago.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.487
- Kids, you know why?
- Don't bring that up.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.381
- You want to know why?
- Would you please stop?

26:54.405 --> 26:58.201
The host of the party suspected
your father was sleeping with his wife.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.661
Stop already!

27:02.871 --> 27:06.543
Hold up. I went to the Hamptons for that?!

27:06.625 --> 27:10.421
I thought we had to go because we were
going to impress Dad's agent.

27:10.505 --> 27:14.300
- Exactly.
- Dad's agent was the host, Layla.

27:15.593 --> 27:16.593
Gross.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.721
What is it with all these young women
and blowjobs?!

27:19.805 --> 27:21.890
Oh, come on...

27:21.974 --> 27:23.518
No, she's not talking to me!

27:23.601 --> 27:25.436
Please do not yell.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.438
Anna,
are you going to talk to me?

27:27.522 --> 27:30.316
Thank you, lady.
My wife thinks I'm with a prostitute now!

27:30.400 --> 27:31.793
<i>What did you just say?!</i>

27:31.817 --> 27:36.197
You know, Jane Underhill
said she caught her 14-year-old

27:36.281 --> 27:39.325
hosting a blowjob party.

27:39.409 --> 27:42.412
Chris, is that where you
met your girlfriend?

27:42.495 --> 27:46.541
Layla, what are your thoughts
on all this cocksucking?

27:47.124 --> 27:48.125
Excuse me?

27:48.209 --> 27:50.211
Sir, do you have a daughter?
Does it bother...

27:50.295 --> 27:53.088
You know what? You know what?
OK, that's enough. That's enough!

27:53.173 --> 27:55.609
- You can get the fuck out of my cab.
- Wait a minute! Hold on!

27:55.633 --> 27:57.514
- Be reasonable!
- No, no, no. I got it. No. No.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.928
Get out of my cab!
You guys can take the bus.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.349
- The fuck? You can't kick us out.
- I'm in crutches here!

28:03.433 --> 28:04.601
Get out of my cab!

28:04.683 --> 28:07.478
- We've got ten blocks to go here!
- I do not care.

28:07.562 --> 28:09.146
Your crippled ass can get out of here

28:09.230 --> 28:11.899
because your wife is not
bringing my daughter into this!

28:11.982 --> 28:14.485
There will be no cock sucking.
Take the fucking train!

28:14.569 --> 28:16.921
- Get the fuck out of my cab!
- Come on, let's get out of here.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.906
Get out of the cab now!
Get the fuck out!

28:18.947 --> 28:20.991
Smells like a urinal in here anyway.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.154
- Go take the train.
- Unbelievable!

28:23.203 --> 28:24.203
Go!

28:24.245 --> 28:26.414
Hey, one of you motherfuckers
better pay me!

28:26.497 --> 28:29.542
I'm gonna piss, then I'll report you!

28:32.337 --> 28:33.754
Well, I hope you're happy.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.798
I'm thrilled. It's great we can
be together like this.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.569
- Just... We should do it more often.
- Taxi!

28:38.593 --> 28:41.178
I am not getting in another cab.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.972
- I'm gonna walk.
- You can't walk.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.559
- I can walk!
- Well, no one's carrying you.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.312
I can't do this anymore.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.690
Couldn't you have waited till
we got back to the apartment, huh?

28:52.773 --> 28:54.733
Instead of in front of the children?!

28:54.816 --> 28:58.153
Or the entire population
of the Upper East Side?

28:58.238 --> 29:01.491
Why, so you can save it
for your next book?!

29:06.246 --> 29:08.539
- That was unfair.
- Mom!

29:14.878 --> 29:17.923
I couldn't control that girl
from texting me.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.176
No. You controlled whether or not
to fuck the girl.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.682
Here. Come here.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.623
- What's the matter?
- Dad, you've got to do something.

29:50.707 --> 29:54.126
You've got to do something.
You got to apologize, she's leaving.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.128
Oh. Anna, can we talk about this?

29:56.211 --> 29:58.189
- Will you do something?
- She's not going anywhere.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.132
- What do you want me to do?
- You guys suck!

30:00.215 --> 30:02.884
Look, everything's going to be all right.

30:03.428 --> 30:04.429
Hold on.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.597
Anna, please, one minute.

30:06.681 --> 30:08.056
One minute.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.017
Would you reconsider

30:10.100 --> 30:12.853
if I told you that I had cancer?

30:13.979 --> 30:16.023
- Dad...?
- What?

30:17.107 --> 30:19.067
Daddy, what are you saying?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.445
I don't have cancer.

30:20.528 --> 30:24.114
I'm just saying, would it be so easy
for you to walk out on me

30:24.197 --> 30:26.241
if I told you that I did?

30:27.410 --> 30:28.494
Huh?

30:31.664 --> 30:33.583
- Unbelievable.
- Mom...

30:39.672 --> 30:41.674
<i>Oy vey.</i>

30:44.926 --> 30:47.388
Honey, it was just a question.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.769
Don't cry.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.052
Would you like me to get you a taxi,
Mrs. Dillane?

31:09.076 --> 31:11.704
Yes, Irving. Please.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.833
- Mom.
- I'm sorry to run out.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.460
You're hardly ever home.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.044
Cut the shit, Mom.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.213
I am, Fenton. This is...

31:23.383 --> 31:26.093
- Well, it's...
- Mom, it's totally fucked up.

31:27.595 --> 31:30.263
I couldn't say it better myself.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.480
I should... I...

31:37.563 --> 31:39.231
I want to go.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.650
I know.

31:40.733 --> 31:41.818
Mom...

31:44.404 --> 31:45.738
I'm sorry.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.989
For what?

31:49.409 --> 31:51.702
If I wasn't so...

31:54.287 --> 31:56.164
I should have been
more available for you, Ma.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.543
- I knew you were sad...
- It's not your fault.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.461
No, but, it is.

32:00.545 --> 32:05.173
Look, Layla was always better
at going after Dad for his shit, but I...

32:05.257 --> 32:06.551
I never did anything.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.720
Neither did I.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.015
Help me with my bags?

32:18.479 --> 32:20.399
Hey Irv, can you throw these
in the trunk for us?

32:20.481 --> 32:22.232
- Sure.
- Thanks.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.529
Wait, Mom...

32:26.612 --> 32:29.740
I'm going to be fine, Fenton.

32:29.824 --> 32:33.160
I just... I need a few days to...

32:34.704 --> 32:35.954
gather...

32:38.875 --> 32:40.292
You got enough pot?

32:41.001 --> 32:42.670
Enough to...

32:43.671 --> 32:46.089
go into this with a clear head.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.720
Be careful.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.972
Stay out of trouble.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.851
What's up, buddy?

33:42.563 --> 33:44.690
- Thirsty?
- Dehydrated.

33:46.274 --> 33:49.486
What are we...
What are we drinking here?

33:49.570 --> 33:51.196
Everything. Here.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.615
That's for you.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.785
Whoa. How'd you know I was here?

33:56.827 --> 33:59.664
I called you. You told me.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.750
You all right?

34:03.333 --> 34:05.085
Hey. To my...

34:05.168 --> 34:06.796
to parents' impending divorce

34:06.879 --> 34:09.632
and to... Jessie's impending marriage.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.634
Yeah.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.388
- You gonna go?
- Of course not.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.850
Because it's never gonna happen.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.940
I gotta piss...

34:29.819 --> 34:32.529
It's that way.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.331
Live a little better.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.092
- What the fuck?!
- I need a little of that shit.

35:37.344 --> 35:40.640
<i>Hey, Fenton, it's James.
I hope we're still good for Friday.</i>

35:58.323 --> 36:01.118
- Hey, Fenton, I thought that was you.
- Oh, shit.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.079
Yeah, hey.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.580
Well, I... I was just going to go in.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.833
- Check it out.
- All right.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.169
This is the door. You've almost made it.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.050
There you are. All right, yeah.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.467
Hey, love.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.137
I brought the spy in from the cold.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.767
I really need you for a second.
It's the caterers.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.060
All right.

36:29.063 --> 36:30.147
Can you give us a minute?

36:30.480 --> 36:33.608
I've got a Joe Bradley,
some Nate Lowmans.

36:33.693 --> 36:36.194
- They aren't cheap.
- I'm not worried about that.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.278
Hi.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.572
Hello?

36:40.490 --> 36:41.784
Yes.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.413
What time exactly?

36:46.496 --> 36:48.665
Alright. Let me see if that works.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.486
What's wrong?

37:18.570 --> 37:20.447
Oh. Nothing.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.241
You look pale
and you're rubbing your head.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.202
I am?

37:25.285 --> 37:27.079
Yeah. I am. I...

37:27.872 --> 37:30.707
- I got into a bar fight the other night.
- What?

37:30.791 --> 37:33.002
Yeah, it was a huge, huge battle.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.336
Tons of guys involved. It was a ruckus.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.798
Nothing like a good old-fashioned
donnybrook.

37:37.882 --> 37:39.299
Hope you got in a few.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.135
Yeah, yeah, no. I took care of business.

37:42.178 --> 37:45.263
I'm sorry, you were in a fight?

37:45.346 --> 37:48.017
I mean, come on,
you won't even get on a roller coaster.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.187
Jess, that's... that's
a motion sickness problem. All right?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.938
That has nothing to do with fear. I've...

37:53.480 --> 37:55.816
I've been in my share of...
"donnybrooks".

37:55.900 --> 37:57.484
Sure.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.114
Oh, it's my dad.

38:02.198 --> 38:04.116
Fenton, do you want a beer or something?

38:04.200 --> 38:07.410
No, thank you. I'm trying not to drink...
so much anymore...

38:07.494 --> 38:10.413
I really need to take this, I'm sorry.
Sweetie, I'm starving.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.332
Yeah, I'll get us some takeout.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.667
Hey, Dad, how are you?

38:14.751 --> 38:16.753
I'll walk with you.

38:22.885 --> 38:26.387
So, I'm assuming
you're not going to buy art today?

38:28.933 --> 38:30.600
That was really strange.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.812
What?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.647
You and Victor in the gallery.
I mean, come on.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.011
Yeah, maybe I should've called you first.
You know, let you know I was stopping by.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.029
OK, well, I would've said no.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.080
Hey, Jess... I'm really sorry.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.749
Wow.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.962
Being in San Francisco did re-invent you.

39:00.089 --> 39:02.757
Damn. I can be pretentious, huh?

39:02.842 --> 39:04.051
You are.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.635
Smoke?

39:05.718 --> 39:08.180
Pretentious and predictable.

39:19.275 --> 39:22.485
You know, I didn't know
how it'd be seeing you.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.655
If I'd burst into tears. If I'd hit you.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.781
If you what?

39:29.534 --> 39:30.785
Thankfully, neither.

39:30.870 --> 39:33.496
Yeah, because both times
have been a surprise. I...

39:34.747 --> 39:38.459
You know, I haven't had time to think
or process, really,

39:38.543 --> 39:40.378
what it'd be like to see you.

39:44.341 --> 39:45.800
This it?

39:48.304 --> 39:50.347
Let me buy you a beer.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.937
Come on, just while you wait
for your takeout.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.746
Thank you.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.290
Thank you.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.673
Hey, the gallery's...
you know, it's charming.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.509
It's small.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.845
Yeah, but it's charming and...

40:31.804 --> 40:34.432
And congratulations, Jessie.

40:37.727 --> 40:38.727
Pretty quick, no?

40:38.770 --> 40:39.771
What?

40:39.854 --> 40:41.606
I don't know. Getting married and all.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.193
I don't think so.

40:45.735 --> 40:46.903
Where'd you guys meet?

40:46.987 --> 40:49.114
It doesn't matter. That's ours.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.998
Being around you, it's... weird.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.584
Oh, what, that surprises you?

41:03.753 --> 41:06.506
I mean, all I can think about is the end.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.301
And defending that story, stupidly.

41:09.385 --> 41:12.096
And then you,
up and leaving for California.

41:17.434 --> 41:18.643
Look, this is hard for me.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.646
What? You don't get any chance
of sympathy right now.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.899
Look, everywhere I go out there,
everything I see,

41:24.984 --> 41:27.069
Jessie, I... Look, I see you.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.571
All right? I miss you.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.948
And yet you never called.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.414
- Come back again
- Thank you.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.334
I want you back, Jess.

41:42.418 --> 41:45.087
That's really great, Fenton.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.587
It's too late for that.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.346
Yeah. I know that now.

41:56.764 --> 42:00.310
And also, even without Victor, what?

42:00.394 --> 42:03.272
You thought one apology would eradicate
you treating me like shit?

42:04.398 --> 42:06.983
- No.
- I've spent time with you.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.319
We've talked now, twice.

42:09.403 --> 42:11.904
I've had time to process this whole thing.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.283
You know, I've thought a lot about this.

42:16.452 --> 42:17.994
To hell with you, Fenton.

42:18.078 --> 42:20.580
I'm still mad at you.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.050
Wow.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.136
Look at that.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.595
What?

42:35.678 --> 42:38.098
That... that freckle right there.

42:39.475 --> 42:41.226
Well, that's extraordinary!

42:45.938 --> 42:48.233
- That tickles.
- What?

42:48.983 --> 42:53.072
You have a freckle on your breast
and it's... it's ticklish.

42:53.155 --> 42:56.408
- Yes. Maybe it's from your beard.
- Maybe.

43:01.205 --> 43:02.830
Can I have it?

43:03.790 --> 43:05.084
Have what?

43:06.376 --> 43:07.835
Can I have...

43:09.088 --> 43:11.047
Can I have this freckle right here?

43:11.131 --> 43:12.715
Can it be mine?

43:40.202 --> 43:42.162
Someone keeps calling me.

43:42.246 --> 43:43.621
Do you recognize this number?

43:46.542 --> 43:48.168
That's Layla.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.089
Well, aren't you going to answer it?

43:53.173 --> 43:59.804
On September 12, 2001,
I bought her a phone.

43:59.887 --> 44:03.600
Programmed it,
told her to keep it on her always.

44:03.683 --> 44:07.103
In all the years since,
she hasn't called me once.

44:07.187 --> 44:10.190
That... is my husband.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.276
Oh...

44:16.904 --> 44:17.947
Try this.

44:28.167 --> 44:29.876
I thought you were getting wine?

44:29.959 --> 44:31.752
May I ask a question?

44:31.836 --> 44:33.713
If you must.

44:34.755 --> 44:39.760
Who is this character, Ahmed Hussein?

44:39.844 --> 44:41.305
Hussaini.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.890
Hussaini, huh?

44:43.973 --> 44:46.726
And how the hell did you
stumble across that name getting wine?

44:46.809 --> 44:50.397
Well, I was walking by your room
and the door was open, so...

44:50.480 --> 44:53.525
Oh, my God!
Did you call him from my phone?

44:53.609 --> 44:54.609
Yeah.

44:57.571 --> 45:00.365
You really need
to set some boundaries, man.

45:00.449 --> 45:02.534
I am concerned about your safety.

45:04.203 --> 45:06.078
Yeah? My safety from what?

45:06.162 --> 45:08.831
People, Layla. People.

45:08.915 --> 45:12.168
I saw that rather exotic name
and I was worried.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.507
- You're fucking nuts.
- Who is he?

45:17.591 --> 45:19.175
He's a friend of Mom's.

45:20.677 --> 45:22.679
Just what I thought.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.640
Where did she meet him?

45:24.722 --> 45:26.642
I don't know. They met somewhere.

45:27.517 --> 45:29.394
Does it matter? He's nice to her.

45:31.438 --> 45:32.564
Are they fucking?

45:32.648 --> 45:35.816
I didn't say that. And how should I know?

45:35.900 --> 45:37.694
All right, never mind.

45:38.487 --> 45:39.987
It doesn't matter.

45:41.323 --> 45:43.283
She'll be back.

45:43.367 --> 45:45.285
She'll be back.

45:47.078 --> 45:48.359
Give me one of those, would you?

45:48.413 --> 45:50.915
- No, stop it.
- Give me a cigarette!

45:50.998 --> 45:53.751
- You don't even smoke!
- I do now.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.548
Hello?

46:03.010 --> 46:05.179
Oh, my God.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.600
What happened?

46:14.648 --> 46:16.358
What happened to you?

46:16.441 --> 46:17.900
No one knows.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.195
John found him on the bathroom floor
at a bar.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.241
Jessie's getting married Saturday.

46:26.368 --> 46:29.036
Goddamn it! That is enough!

46:29.120 --> 46:31.998
No one's gonna feel sorry for themselves
in this house!

46:32.081 --> 46:34.250
What are we, a bunch of sad sacks?!

46:35.960 --> 46:37.629
I'm taking us out to dinner.

46:38.588 --> 46:42.091
Do something with your hair,
it looks like you combed it with a towel.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.386
Stop smoking so much.

46:50.559 --> 46:54.145
Well, so San Francisco is a terrible town.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.855
You should've gone to Hollywood.

46:55.938 --> 46:57.916
You said a serious writer
should never go to Hollywood.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.568
Who said you were a serious writer?

46:59.651 --> 47:02.278
Dad! Do you always
have to be such a douchebag?

47:02.362 --> 47:04.947
Oh, come. I'm joking.
I'm trying to cheer him up.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.366
It's not working.

47:06.450 --> 47:08.327
Well, is the booze helping?

47:08.410 --> 47:10.161
- Yes.
- No.

47:11.747 --> 47:12.830
Another round?

47:13.914 --> 47:16.335
Well, so who is
this girlfriend of yours, Mary?

47:16.418 --> 47:17.960
Her name is Jessie.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.962
- Oh?
- I don't want to talk about it.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.882
I heard he's rich. Who is he?

47:24.258 --> 47:25.258
Victor Dell.

47:26.678 --> 47:30.097
- I'm sorry.
- The curator! Shit!

47:30.181 --> 47:31.932
Fenton, you're in trouble.

47:32.601 --> 47:34.018
He's loaded.

47:35.019 --> 47:40.609
His father, Max, makes those
un-watchable, giant extravaganzas.

47:40.692 --> 47:42.527
Total bullshit.

47:42.611 --> 47:44.987
But very successful.

47:46.030 --> 47:49.534
His son's got to be an asshole.
It's never going to last.

47:49.618 --> 47:50.858
That's what I keep telling her.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.414
What about you? When are you
going to get yourself a boyfriend?

47:55.247 --> 47:57.041
Oh, gee, Dad, I don't know.

47:57.124 --> 47:58.710
Well, you're not a lesbian are you?

47:58.794 --> 48:00.629
I mean, I'd be OK with that if you are.

48:01.630 --> 48:04.758
I'm not going to dignify that
with a response.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.012
- Do I seem like a lesbian?
- Yeah, sometimes.

48:10.680 --> 48:14.058
I'm very sorry, I have to meet someone.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.685
Completely forgot about it.

48:15.769 --> 48:17.437
You need some cash?

48:17.521 --> 48:18.938
Cocktails, taxis...

48:19.021 --> 48:21.441
That shit's expensive. Yeah...

48:22.818 --> 48:25.654
Can we have one more?
We probably will need one more.

48:25.737 --> 48:27.572
- One more?
- Yeah.

48:27.656 --> 48:28.948
Fenton...

48:30.116 --> 48:32.368
I don't want your sister

48:32.452 --> 48:34.203
riding in the subway at night.

48:34.704 --> 48:37.998
Oh, but Dad, that's where
I meet all my girlfriends.

48:42.754 --> 48:44.631
No wonder Mom left him.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.760
- Someone should really kick his ass.
- I'll do it.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.443
What's up, sexy?

49:07.153 --> 49:08.279
Hannah...

49:08.362 --> 49:10.030
What?

49:12.701 --> 49:14.786
- This is going to hurt.
- What is?

49:16.538 --> 49:17.706
Chris, what's wrong?

49:17.789 --> 49:20.459
We can't see one another anymore.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.714
I wasn't exactly single when I met you.

49:25.797 --> 49:29.049
I know. I know, but I love you.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.720
I...

49:32.846 --> 49:34.527
No, you don't. I mean, you think you do...

49:34.598 --> 49:37.183
Don't tell me
what I feel and what I don't.

49:37.266 --> 49:39.895
Well... Hannah...

49:39.977 --> 49:42.062
You teach me how to write,
but that's not how

49:42.146 --> 49:44.332
your cock ended up in my mouth.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.860
A little too much to drink.

49:46.943 --> 49:49.069
Fuck you.
Don't treat me like I'm your daughter.

49:49.153 --> 49:51.030
- Excuse me?
- What is it?

49:51.113 --> 49:53.492
I hate you so fucking much.

49:53.575 --> 49:55.284
You're... you're Christopher Dillane?

49:56.410 --> 49:58.788
Unfortunately, at this moment, I am.

49:58.872 --> 50:00.957
I just wanted to come by and thank you.

50:01.040 --> 50:01.875
Oh?

50:01.958 --> 50:04.418
I'm doing a dissertation
on your novel,<i> Wife.</i>

50:04.503 --> 50:05.545
Oh?

50:05.629 --> 50:08.172
Anyway... like I said,
I just wanted to thank you.

50:08.255 --> 50:11.258
The novel inspired me
to tell my parents that I was gay.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.177
Well, that's wonderful!

50:13.260 --> 50:15.931
Thank you.
Can I buy you a drink? Anything?

50:16.013 --> 50:18.224
No, no, that's great. Thank you.

50:18.307 --> 50:19.976
Have a great night.

50:24.146 --> 50:26.816
Hannah, sweetheart, don't be upset.

50:27.692 --> 50:28.692
I mean...

50:29.903 --> 50:33.405
You're going to... meet someone else.

50:33.489 --> 50:36.450
How about that guy Matt in class?
I see the way he looks at you...

50:36.535 --> 50:39.036
I can't believe you're suggesting
other men right now.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.580
Are you fucking crazy?

50:40.664 --> 50:42.307
I'm just trying
to smooth the road for you.

50:42.331 --> 50:44.166
- Smooth the road? Fuck you!
- Oh!

50:51.048 --> 50:52.341
Hey...

50:52.424 --> 50:55.679
Hey, I have fights all the time like that
with my daughter.

50:57.388 --> 50:59.098
Yeah.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.442
Yo, buddy.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.403
Hey, what's going on?

51:12.486 --> 51:14.739
Nothing. Just chilling.

51:15.991 --> 51:18.743
- It's kinda late for a pop-in.
- A pop-in.

51:18.827 --> 51:20.327
Hey, do you...

51:20.411 --> 51:22.872
Do you know my buddy Chad from Greenpoint?

51:22.956 --> 51:24.833
- No.
- Really?

51:24.916 --> 51:26.208
I could have sworn you had.

51:26.292 --> 51:28.920
You met him, I mean. He's a good dude.

51:30.421 --> 51:34.466
Well... Chad...
has this younger sister,

51:34.550 --> 51:37.053
like, awesome girl. Best chick.

51:37.136 --> 51:39.430
And... this boy, Ralph,

51:39.513 --> 51:41.390
sort of had this thing for her.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.643
And so Ralph...

51:43.727 --> 51:44.603
Wait, John, are you...

51:44.686 --> 51:46.562
Are you here to see Layla?

51:46.646 --> 51:47.814
No.

51:49.065 --> 51:50.274
Yes.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.357
Yeah.

51:52.861 --> 51:54.029
Is there a Ralph?

51:56.363 --> 51:57.448
No.

51:58.324 --> 52:00.534
I'm Ralph.

52:00.619 --> 52:01.953
For the story, I changed my name.

52:03.370 --> 52:06.373
I really like her, Fenton.

52:11.253 --> 52:12.631
OK.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.382
Is that OK?

52:17.134 --> 52:18.135
Does she know about it?

52:18.218 --> 52:20.304
Yeah. Of course.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.974
John, I'll be out
in just a minute!

52:23.058 --> 52:24.058
Oh.

52:24.934 --> 52:25.934
Yeah.

52:27.062 --> 52:28.395
You have my blessing.

52:29.981 --> 52:31.565
That's all I ever wanted.

52:35.361 --> 52:36.821
Fenton, let me ask you something.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.645
Did you really mean what you wrote
about me in your story?

52:42.618 --> 52:43.828
I didn't know you read it.

52:43.912 --> 52:45.412
I'm not a clown.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.125
John, it wasn't about you.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.670
It sure felt like it was about me.

52:54.213 --> 52:55.297
I don't know what to say.

52:55.381 --> 52:58.968
Look. People talk shit, I know that.

52:59.385 --> 53:02.638
You know, people couldn't believe that
Johnny Roth got a job at Goldman.

53:02.722 --> 53:05.934
Oh, funny man becomes a finance guy!
What?!

53:08.268 --> 53:11.522
I know they all had "told you so" smirks
when I got fired though.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.315
I know that.

53:16.152 --> 53:20.073
I want to know that you're not gonna be
disappointed with Layla for being with me.

53:20.156 --> 53:22.701
Come on, man.
I never said anything like that.

53:22.784 --> 53:24.493
But it's what you wrote.

53:24.576 --> 53:26.578
Fenton, it hurt me.

53:26.662 --> 53:28.808
You know, I have only
ever tried to be a friend to you.

53:28.832 --> 53:31.208
- Hey man, we are friends...
- Good. Then, treat me like it!

53:31.291 --> 53:32.501
All right?

53:32.584 --> 53:34.754
Things got shitty for you. I get that.

53:34.838 --> 53:37.190
You know, I don't know anyone
who hasn't had to deal with shitty.

53:37.214 --> 53:40.467
But you're the only one that peaced-out
to California and fucking disappeared.

53:41.136 --> 53:42.386
What are you, six?

53:47.142 --> 53:48.392
I'm not a clown.

53:50.352 --> 53:51.813
I never have been.

54:13.084 --> 54:14.878
Fucking Knicks, yo.

54:14.961 --> 54:18.714
Madison Square Garden is like
the Mecca of basketball, is it not?

54:19.673 --> 54:21.467
'73 was a long time ago...

54:21.550 --> 54:24.344
Yeah, it was. Neither one of us was alive.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.638
I thought you were
looking for a job in there.

54:26.722 --> 54:28.599
Oh, shit.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.267
My bad. My bad.

54:30.350 --> 54:34.063
It's just, between you and the sports
section it's hard to concentrate.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.949
Oh, shit.

54:46.742 --> 54:47.911
Do I know you?

54:49.037 --> 54:50.746
Yeah, I'm John.

54:50.830 --> 54:52.539
John Roth.

54:52.623 --> 54:53.875
Remember me?

54:53.958 --> 54:55.168
Should I?

54:56.335 --> 54:57.336
I'm Fenton's friend.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.173
Oh.

55:02.133 --> 55:05.552
Are you always this generous
with Fenton's friends?

55:06.888 --> 55:09.891
I'm about as generous as you are
with your students, Daddy.

55:11.100 --> 55:12.684
<i>Touché.</i>

55:16.730 --> 55:21.360
Jesus, these Knicks are worse
than a dumpster fire!

55:22.653 --> 55:27.116
It's a shame too, because when they won
in '73 this was a great town,

55:27.200 --> 55:29.828
not a mall with a bunch of tourists.

55:29.911 --> 55:31.495
I was just saying that.

55:33.081 --> 55:36.750
You have experience
from '73 do you, kiddo?

55:42.548 --> 55:45.301
Well, I mean, I was just
looking for a job, but...

55:45.384 --> 55:47.403
the only thing close
to what I was getting at Goldman is

55:47.427 --> 55:49.596
a job in the Sanitation Department.

55:50.806 --> 55:53.433
The only difference
between bankers and garbage haulers

55:53.517 --> 55:57.646
is that we need garbage haulers
because we're all a bunch of pigs.

55:57.729 --> 56:01.150
Lay, you think I'd...
think I'd be a good garbage man?

56:02.193 --> 56:04.403
You went to Dalton, John.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.073
So did Chevy Chase.

56:07.156 --> 56:10.952
What do you do? For a living, that is.

56:12.161 --> 56:13.829
He's self-employed.

56:14.873 --> 56:15.873
Doing what?

56:17.917 --> 56:20.460
I'm in... alternative healthcare.

56:21.337 --> 56:23.089
I sell weed.

56:25.674 --> 56:26.926
Huh.

56:27.010 --> 56:29.012
Well, stick with that.

56:32.223 --> 56:33.599
Morning.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.228
Dad, you running a bed and breakfast now?

56:37.312 --> 56:38.980
More like a brothel.

56:41.648 --> 56:42.942
Sit down, I made breakfast.

56:43.026 --> 56:44.776
I know. I don't have time.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.279
What's the hurry?

56:46.362 --> 56:47.863
Yeah, seriously where are you going?

56:47.947 --> 56:49.823
I have things to do.

56:49.908 --> 56:53.619
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.623
I don't think he heard me.

56:58.249 --> 57:01.543
I don't think we're going to be listening
to you anytime soon, Pops.

57:22.357 --> 57:24.150
What are you doing here?

57:24.233 --> 57:25.484
Hi! I...

57:25.567 --> 57:26.735
Look, I just...

57:26.818 --> 57:28.779
Something just happened, I got some news.

57:28.862 --> 57:30.198
What?

57:32.116 --> 57:33.575
You know what, it's...

57:33.659 --> 57:35.370
It's not important.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.620
I swear, it isn't.

57:36.703 --> 57:38.747
OK, I just... I had to see you.

57:38.830 --> 57:41.125
All right?
I didn't like how the other night ended.

57:42.043 --> 57:43.627
Me neither.

57:43.710 --> 57:45.940
Yeah. So I thought it would be a good idea
to come over here,

57:45.964 --> 57:47.714
you know, unannounced again,
and remind you

57:47.798 --> 57:50.509
what a selfish prick I am
before tomorrow happens.

57:52.011 --> 57:54.389
Wait, is that a smile on your face?
Do you...?

57:54.471 --> 57:57.433
You are hallucinating. I have to go.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.395
Yeah, I get it. Wedding stuff.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.854
No, work stuff. And now I'm late.

58:03.189 --> 58:04.023
Why are you...

58:04.107 --> 58:05.827
Because you keep showing up
like the cute...

58:05.857 --> 58:06.692
Thank you very much.

58:06.775 --> 58:09.988
Irish psycho in <i> Sleeping with the Enemy.</i>

58:10.071 --> 58:11.863
I don't know why
you're working again, Jess.

58:11.947 --> 58:14.200
Because I have to make a living.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.785
You're getting married tomorrow.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.413
Yeah.

58:19.705 --> 58:21.707
Everything's pretty much set up.

58:21.790 --> 58:23.459
Victor's with his parents.

58:23.542 --> 58:27.296
The only tradition he seems to believe in
is not seeing me the night before.

58:27.380 --> 58:30.049
And I really don't want to see my parents,
so...

58:30.133 --> 58:31.384
I thought that I should work.

58:31.467 --> 58:33.510
Let me come with you?

58:33.593 --> 58:34.886
No. That's crazy.

58:35.721 --> 58:37.265
Hey, Stash.

58:38.057 --> 58:40.268
- Stash?
- You're late.

58:40.351 --> 58:42.561
I'm sorry. It's his fault.

58:42.644 --> 58:45.273
Nice going. Now I'm running late.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.025
Well, I can come back.

58:47.108 --> 58:48.192
No, no, no, no.

58:48.276 --> 58:50.569
The selections are laid out for you
are over here.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.405
Ruined my day here.

58:53.697 --> 58:56.867
I have to try and get 20 naked Czech
models to do what I want them to do.

58:57.617 --> 58:58.827
Ciao. Ciao.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.709
"Ciao. Ciao."

59:07.503 --> 59:09.047
He's an artist.

59:09.130 --> 59:10.298
Oh.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.425
God, you are still the same.

59:12.508 --> 59:14.177
So judgmental.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.677
OK.

59:15.761 --> 59:17.888
Yeah, maybe I'm still a little judgmental.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.556
But...

59:25.188 --> 59:27.356
You remember the day
that you gave me your freckle?

59:29.442 --> 59:33.196
I'm just curious, is it still mine or did
you give it to somebody else, or...?

59:33.279 --> 59:34.863
Yeah. Sure.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.289
Well that one's great.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.084
Yeah, it is.

59:46.542 --> 59:48.252
It's beautiful.

59:53.091 --> 59:54.425
Do you remember our road trip?

59:57.052 --> 59:58.595
How could I forget spring break?

59:59.263 --> 01:00:01.866
Yeah, all our friends went to Mexico and
you took me to Des Moines, Iowa.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.268
On a... On a photo safari.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.440
I got some great images.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.362
The butter sculptures.

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:18.031
Well I'm not sure that
that qualifies as a great image.

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:19.991
The melting David.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.203
I don't know,
Michelangelo would have been proud.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.831
I've still got the...

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:29.377
that picture you took
of the cornfield in my...

01:00:31.587 --> 01:00:33.381
in my room.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.093
You ever do anything
with the rest of those?

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:40.177
I thought you were going
to show them or something.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:43.932
Someday.

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.186
You should, you know.

01:00:49.522 --> 01:00:51.566
You're serious about that now?

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:01.855
You know, I always thought
that you were gonna be the one.

01:01:06.539 --> 01:01:08.081
I was so sure of it.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.295
We had something...

01:01:13.254 --> 01:01:15.839
really wonderful for a while.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.676
And then you had to fuck it up.

01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:30.687
No, Fenton. Don't.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:51.082
- Wait, stop! This is wrong.
- Why?

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:33.292
Oh, my God...

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.339
I have to go.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.508
I'm getting married tomorrow.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.974
Jessie! Hold up!

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:51.602
Hey.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.330
Oh, shit...

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:54.522
What?!

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.524
I don't think you should get married.

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:59.150
- I love Victor.
- I love you, Jess.

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.655
Jesus Christ, Jessie,
we just broke up, like, a year ago!

01:03:02.738 --> 01:03:04.282
A year and a half.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.535
- We just made love...
- No, we fucked!

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.412
Jess, you're making a mistake.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:12.956
Yeah, I did make a mistake,
a huge one with you.

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:15.710
What, you thought my mistake
was marrying Victor?

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.673
That's something I'll find out
with him, Fenton.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:19.796
Something you have nothing to do with.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.567
I mean, what did you think was going
to happen? I would just wait for you?

01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:24.050
No.

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:25.802
Yes.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.220
No, I don't know what I thought.

01:03:27.305 --> 01:03:28.930
You left me.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.766
Yeah. I know I did.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:34.770
And I was there for you. Even after what
you wrote about us in that stupid story.

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.776
"The tragically pretty,
comfortably affluent girl

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.361
so riddled with insecurities

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:45.071
she'd rather sell other people's art
than make her own?"

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:47.491
Do you remember writing that?

01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:48.701
Look, I fucked up.

01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:51.870
Wow. You are being
way too kind to yourself.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.956
- You ruined my family.
- No. I exposed a failed marriage.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.375
It wasn't yours to expose!

01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:58.645
But I wasn't even writing about
your parents, Jess! All right?

01:03:58.669 --> 01:03:59.878
It was mine.

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:03.382
Goddamn it, it's like all this time

01:04:03.466 --> 01:04:06.926
everybody's up my ass because they think
that every character in the story is them!

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.723
That's because everyone knows you use your
gift of observation just to hurt people.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:14.810
Wow.

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:17.438
Look, I made a mistake, Jess.

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:21.149
No. You made a choice.

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:24.653
And I've made mine.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:15.579
Fuck.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.335
Fuck.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.212
Fuck.

01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:31.261
Layla!

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:32.638
- Layla!
- Ho!

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:34.807
- Fuck.
- What's going on in there?

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.651
Fuck, I had some pages right here,
some new pages and they're missing.

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:41.062
And I need to tear them to shreds... shit!

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.648
Fuck.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.443
- I have them and I read them.
- What?

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:47.193
They're good.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:51.169
- Yeah, they're not yours to read, Dad.
- I know, but they're good.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.991
Cheer up. Cheer up!

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.036
Come on, what's the matter with you?
You're so antsy.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.122
Yeah, I just...

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.166
I just slept with Jessie.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:08.213
Shit.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.385
That's a big fucking deal.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.974
Her wedding is tomorrow.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.524
That's not good.

01:06:32.907 --> 01:06:34.588
Do you remember the last time we did this?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.869
What?

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:38.704
Took a walk together.

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.749
Yeah, Ewing was still playing
for the Knicks.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:46.629
Oh, well, see... that's not good.

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.129
Have a seat next to me.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.382
You know, I don't really
feel like a pep talk today.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:55.303
I wasn't planning on giving one.
Come on, sit down next to your old man.

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:04.647
You're a good writer, Fenton.

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:07.900
I believe in your new stuff.

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:09.652
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.195
Especially love that character

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.449
of the dissolute novelist
who's cheating on his wife.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.222
That's the same kind of shit that got me
in so much trouble in the first place.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.749
And it's precisely what gives you
so much potential.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:26.334
But be more than that.
Don't do what I did.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.795
What are you talking about?

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:32.550
I didn't care about anything

01:07:32.633 --> 01:07:33.842
but being a novelist.

01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:36.011
I was a shit husband.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.973
Lousy father, let's face it.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.768
Things I needed to work on,
I forgot all about that.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:45.688
I was just a success.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:50.066
And I let everybody down, I know that.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:51.902
I let myself down.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.656
But it's not too late for you.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:59.284
You're still young enough
not to make my mistakes.

01:08:08.669 --> 01:08:11.630
I think your mother
is leaving me for good.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.883
Yeah, so do I.

01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:18.720
I feel awful.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:26.854
I guess...

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.819
sometimes the best thing you can do
for someone is just...

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.654
let them go.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.630
- Christopher?
- Ah.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.546
No, no. Don't get up.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:58.176
Is this your... your next masterpiece?

01:08:58.259 --> 01:08:59.510
Yes.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:02.930
The next great American novel.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:10.313
Of course, you and I both know I've only
written one good book my entire life.

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:13.024
And I remember...

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.488
I remember you
walking around with the manuscripts

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.198
in a shopping bag all over the city.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.573
Huh?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:25.953
I delivered them
to every agent and publisher

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.997
in New York City.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:31.960
Those were mad, grand days.

01:09:32.044 --> 01:09:33.627
They loved you.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.799
Oh...

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.636
We were never the same.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.888
No...

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:50.435
Can...

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:52.731
you...

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.942
come back to me?

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.187
Full disclosure, Fenton:

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.981
I never would have asked you
to come back to New York

01:11:58.065 --> 01:12:01.026
if we weren't serious
about wanting to publish this novel.

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:02.861
Yeah, soon, James...

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:06.558
To be honest, I feel like
I've just hit on something and...

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.160
you know, I'd like some more time,
if it's possible.

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:12.162
Please keep writing.

01:12:33.851 --> 01:12:35.227
Layla.

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.312
Layla!

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.773
- I did not...
- You didn't knock.

01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:43.110
Layla, could you please
put some clothes on.

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:44.777
Oh, come on, don't be such a prude.

01:12:44.862 --> 01:12:47.548
How many times have you seen me naked?
We used to take baths together.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.926
Yeah, when we were little kids!
Tell her to put some clothes on, John.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.910
- Layla, put some...
- The fuck, John?!

01:12:51.994 --> 01:12:53.287
Oh, shit. Sorry.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.454
What do you want?

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.915
Therapy.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.878
Oh, and to tell you Jessie's wedding
is in an hour, so...

01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:02.963
Hurry up or you're going to be late.

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:19.980
Why are you walking so fast?

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.232
Because it's important to me.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:31.866
So, you know I have to go back to Bard
in a couple of days, right?

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:35.078
Yeah, funny thing about that actually...

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.538
Yeah, what's that?

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.375
This guy up there is opening up a new bar.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.710
Might need some help running it.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:44.837
Really?

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:49.592
If it doesn't jam you up, I wouldn't mind
getting out of the city for a minute.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.719
Come on, let's not be late.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.264
One moment, please.

01:13:56.141 --> 01:13:59.810
I think I'd feel totally un-jammed
by that situation.

01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:02.356
- Oh, yeah?
- I'd really love that.

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:38.141
I'm so sorry, Anna.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.321
Hey.

01:15:14.386 --> 01:15:15.594
Go.

01:15:31.111 --> 01:15:33.238
It's a little awkward.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.307
Are you OK?

01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.782
No, I can't believe I fucked this up too!

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.228
- Oh!
- Hey.

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:06.354
Shit. Let me out.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:34.965
Are you leaving?

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.553
No. I was looking for you.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.766
Dad...

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:46.060
you remember Fenton, right.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.442
Can you...
Can you give us a minute?

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:58.072
I'll... tell them you're having
an issue with your dress.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.368
Good to see you, sir.

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:02.743
Yeah.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.210
What are you doing?

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.548
Getting married... I guess.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:19.136
Yeah, everyone's in there... waiting.

01:17:19.219 --> 01:17:22.012
I don't know if I can do this.

01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:36.528
Why not?

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.698
Well, I didn't sleep last night.

01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:43.826
That makes sense,

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:46.371
- night before the wedding.
- You're kidding, right?

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.707
Well, there's that too.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.835
I wanted to tell Victor what happened.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.255
- That's probably not a good idea.
- Yeah.

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.341
He wouldn't understand.

01:18:00.302 --> 01:18:02.094
Do you?

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.681
Not really.

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:11.313
God, I'm fucking terrified, Fenton.

01:18:12.314 --> 01:18:17.026
I mean, did I rush into this
so soon after...

01:18:20.322 --> 01:18:24.367
He is a really good man and I love him.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.912
God, this is so pathetic.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.417
I was so sure a week ago.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.795
Look, if you want I'll just...

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:37.879
I'll just tell them...

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.384
that you're having second thoughts,

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:43.737
that you're scared to death
you might be making a mistake.

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.763
That we had sex the other day.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.309
That you think you might be marrying
the wrong man.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.645
- Really? You'd do that?
- In a heartbeat.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.438
We'll just catch a cab.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.981
Ride off into the sunset.

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:59.402
Live happily ever after.

01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:02.239
In Des Moines. With 2.3 kids,

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:05.783
a white picket fence, a yard.

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:09.704
Big fucking butter sculpture.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.336
Jess... it's been...

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:20.005
It's really hard to see you.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.511
It's been good, you know.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.973
I realized that your life
didn't stop and mine did.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:33.811
You went on.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.275
Met new friends.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.403
Got a new lover.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.782
My God, look at you.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:51.245
You're beautiful, Jess.

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:55.542
And you deserve the best.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:02.089
So what do I do?

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.347
Keep going.

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:16.604
OK.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.041
You were leaving, weren't you?

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:41.338
I thought so.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:48.330
