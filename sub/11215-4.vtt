WEBVTT

00:32.766 --> 00:34.068
Previously on Southland...

00:34.102 --> 00:35.236
What, you're
turning me in?

00:35.269 --> 00:36.337
You're damn right I am.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.106
The hell?!

00:40.741 --> 00:41.775
Stop the car right now!

00:46.147 --> 00:48.249
He's going to the farm.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.751
He can dry out.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.286
This sucks.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.387
Hey, he could've
killed you.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.655
There's no place to hide.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.757
You will be on TV.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.761
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:00.794 --> 01:01.829
(helicopter flying overhead)

01:01.862 --> 01:03.797
(camera shutter clicking)

01:08.336 --> 01:09.703
One bullet hole
in the back.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.405
It's a clean wound.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.275
Shooter probably used
a nine millimeter.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.577
Can you get the coroner
so we can flip her over?

01:16.610 --> 01:17.878
Any other visible

01:17.911 --> 01:19.613
marks or bruises?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.382
None that I can see.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.351
RAY:
All right.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.156
On three.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.158
One, two, three.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.327
(sighs)

01:33.361 --> 01:36.530
Pretty girl.

01:36.564 --> 01:39.733
I'd say
she's 19, 20.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.902
Burn marks
on her mouth.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.772
Crack pipe?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.874
Yep, probably so.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.342
Burn marks on
her fingers, too.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.843
Can you get shots
of both of these?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.315
MAN:
Every victim has a story.

01:54.348 --> 01:58.286
Detective Lydia Adams
has seen this one before.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.821
(shutter clicking)

02:00.854 --> 02:02.790
Go talk to Weezy.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.824
Hey, guys.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.925
This is Ray.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.260
Ray, this is Nate and Sammy.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.728
How you doing?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.730
Owner of the house says
he was leaving for work at 6:00,

02:09.763 --> 02:11.699
found the girl lying
in his yard, already dead.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.801
We can probably get a time
of death from the coroner.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.569
Did he recognize her?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.870
No.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.207
Found this in the bushes,
two houses down.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.545
No wallet,
just a set of keys.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.215
And a school I.D.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.517
S.U.L.A., Nicole Hill.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.884
Guess she took a wrong turn

02:30.918 --> 02:32.953
coming outside
the library, huh?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.788
Big party at a gang house
down the block.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.791
We know the kid, Weezy,
from Pyro Bloods.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.228
I'll go talk to him.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.396
All right.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.665
Pardon me, did you hear
anything last night?

02:44.698 --> 02:45.866
Gunshots maybe?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.735
Please, on this block?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.337
Every night I hear gunshots.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.538
I wear earplugs.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.805
Well, maybe you saw
something then.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.474
Somebody chasing the girl,
something?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.777
See no evil, hear no evil,
do no evil.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.813
The only good thing I ever
learned from the Bible.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.482
Okay.
Actually, it's,
uh, "see no evil,

03:01.515 --> 03:03.717
"hear no evil,
speak no evil."

03:03.751 --> 03:04.852
And it's Buddhist.

03:15.663 --> 03:19.500
(hip hop playing)

03:26.440 --> 03:29.310
* Bottles in the air

03:29.343 --> 03:31.345
* We doin' this packed venue

03:31.379 --> 03:33.714
* Just follow the flares,
we over there *

03:33.747 --> 03:35.649
* She could see us
like the bat signals *

03:35.683 --> 03:37.851
* Depending what
I'm in the mood for... *

03:37.885 --> 03:39.653
*

03:50.764 --> 03:52.666
They're so sweet
when they sleep.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.402
Wake up, Weezy!

03:54.435 --> 03:56.370
Weezy, wake up!

03:59.440 --> 04:02.976
Morning!
What the (bleep)?!

04:03.010 --> 04:06.647
What you (bleep)
doing in my house?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.316
A girl got killed
outside your house, man.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.618
Who did it?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.320
I ain't seen it.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.887
I was inside.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.022
What'd she do, cheat on you?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.790
Did she steal your money?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.392
Man, I ain't even
know that bitch.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.960
I just heard about it.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.030
You arresting him?

04:23.063 --> 04:24.865
No, ma'am.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.867
Just having a
conversation.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.336
He don't conversate
unless he have to.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.670
He have to?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.505
No ma'am.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.741
Then get out my house!

04:36.510 --> 04:38.512
Dewey in rehab.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.647
I can't wait to see
what this looks like.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.449
Rehab.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.451
It's more like a freakin' spa
with a bunch of ex-addicts

04:43.484 --> 04:44.652
walking around in flip flops

04:44.685 --> 04:46.820
and yammering about
their higher power.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.622
You've been there before?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.858
Yeah, I visited.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.493
OFFICER:
Tell Dewey he owes me
a plate of tacos!

04:52.526 --> 04:54.462
Tell that bastard
even I miss him!

04:54.495 --> 04:56.364
You know you're gonna be stuck
going to that funeral with me.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.799
It's your last chance
to get out of it.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.101
I'm good.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.373
All right, don't say
I didn't warn you.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.841
Death and drunks
in the desert.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.611
Some day.
(chuckling)

05:12.580 --> 05:13.947
Hey, hey!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.649
Get the hell out of here,
man, what are you doing?!

05:15.683 --> 05:17.618
Get out!

05:19.853 --> 05:21.655
I got shell casings.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.991
LYDIA:
I got some shoes over here.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.526
Nicole was barefoot.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.796
Maybe she kicked them off
trying to run.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.501
What'd you guys find out
from party boy?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.469
He loves his grandma.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.039
RAY:
Two shell casings.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.510
The shooter fired here
and then here.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.777
Victim only had
one bullet wound.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.846
That means either
the shooter missed

05:45.879 --> 05:46.914
or there's
a second victim.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.616
We'll check the hospitals.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.918
We'll head north, Kenny
and Andy can go south.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.586
That was fast.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.022
I guess our crackhead murder
just got an upgrade.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.925
Yeah, now it's
the tragic death

05:57.958 --> 06:00.428
of a promising
S.U.L.A. student.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.809
Mr. Hill?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.945
Yeah, that's me.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.881
I'm Detective Adams.
This is Detective Suarez.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.454
I see you used to run track.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.121
Actually, they all do,
except me.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.523
Our oldest daughter, Michelle,

06:29.557 --> 06:30.858
won the bronze medal
in the Olympics.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.693
You must've been proud.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.628
And Nicole has set
several records

06:34.662 --> 06:36.497
for the S.U.L.A. team already.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.466
Leslie, enough.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.703
Um, I don't mean
to be rude,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.972
but you ain't come
here to talk track.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.774
No, we didn't.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.642
We're here about Nicole.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.911
Our baby.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.981
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.883
but Nicole was killed.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.818
No!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.853
(sobbing):
Oh, no!

06:59.887 --> 07:01.922
Oh, no!

07:01.955 --> 07:03.056
How?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.592
She was shot, sir.
Oh!

07:04.625 --> 07:05.993
On campus?

07:06.026 --> 07:08.829
No, about half a mile
from here on Slauson.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.899
She was in the neighborhood.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.701
Is that unusual?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.903
Our daughters did not socialize
in this neighborhood.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.105
When was the last time
you saw Nicole?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.808
A month or so ago.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.644
She's so busy with track
practice and school...

07:23.677 --> 07:24.945
Did you notice a change
in that time?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.749
Mention any new friends?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.017
She was seeing someone.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.553
A football player
at school, Tyler.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.687
Tyler Prescott?

07:33.721 --> 07:35.856
The linebacker for the Tigers?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's from the projects.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.992
But Nicole lived in the dorms.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.094
What could I do?

07:41.128 --> 07:44.197
(sobbing):
Oh, God!

07:44.231 --> 07:48.636
Two parents, good home,
a free ride to S.U.L.A....

07:48.669 --> 07:50.904
This girl had no excuses.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.105
She just blew it.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
You always this hard
on the victim?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.076
You know how it is
around here.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.146
Dads are either
in jail or on drugs.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.882
And Mr. Hill worked a hard job
for a long time to make sure

08:01.915 --> 08:03.951
those girls got out
of this neighborhood.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.887
Nicole still ended up
on the wrong side of Slauson.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.923
In my neighborhood,
the street was Lincoln.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.825
It was the dividing
line, right?

08:11.859 --> 08:15.162
Growing up, my mom would be
like, "Do not cross Slauson."

08:15.195 --> 08:18.265
But now there's gangs
on both sides of the line.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.900
So, you grew up around here.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.235
(gunshots)

08:26.073 --> 08:28.576
King 54, there
were shots fired

08:28.609 --> 08:30.778
in the vicinity
of 36th and Budlong.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.913
This unit's not involved.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.117
Yeah, I grew up around here.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.892
We get gunshot victims
every night.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.594
What are you looking for?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.596
Someone with gang tats acting
shady about what happened.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.130
Door number three, enjoy.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.599
Thank you.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.769
Oh, no, what happened
to you, ese?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.104
You get shot?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.640
Yeah, blew my ear off.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.641
Ouch, who shot you?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.075
He did.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.612
He tried to kill himself.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.080
And missed?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.616
Let me guess, you put
the gun behind your ear,

09:08.649 --> 09:09.917
but then you just
flinched a little bit

09:09.950 --> 09:11.251
before you pulled
the trigger, right?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.754
She said she was gonna
break up with me.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.125
Ain't worth livin'
without her.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.093
GIRLFRIEND:
It's gonna be
all right, baby.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.634
I saved the ear.

09:26.634 --> 09:30.003
Wanna get something to eat?

09:30.037 --> 09:34.207
Tyler Prescott, that football
player Nicole was dating,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.910
he was arrested last year.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.379
Assaulted a woman at a bar.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.382
Hmm, black eye,
bruises on her neck.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.252
That didn't make the paper.

09:45.285 --> 09:49.690
Yeah, that's 'cause
she dropped the charges.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.226
Probably driving around
in a brand new Lexus right now.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.330
Lots of football boosters, they,
uh, they own car dealerships.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.067
You saying some football nut
paid her off?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.769
People love their teams.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.304
And the school
lets him keep playing.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.839
Who shot you?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.407
I ain't see.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.242
I'm the one shot
in the back, ain't I?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.411
Were you with that
girl, Nicole Hill?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.013
Hell, no.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.682
She the target.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.383
I got clipped 'cause I was
standing near the bitch.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.886
Why would someone
want to shoot Nicole?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.354
Lot of people got beef
with the Hill sisters.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.891
Sisters?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.659
Was Nicole's sister there too?

10:25.693 --> 10:28.662
Naw, man, she too good
for the hood.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.263
Nicole that way, too.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.665
You hear about 'em,

10:31.699 --> 10:33.901
but you don't see 'em.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.435
(mocking)
"They track stars.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.138
"They go to S.U.L.A.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.173
"They gone go to the 'lympics."

10:40.207 --> 10:41.942
(bleep) that.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.746
So, what was Nicole
doing at that party?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.380
Tryin' to score crack.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.950
Turned out to be a crack ho
like the rest of 'em.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.753
Who sells to her?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.054
Nobody.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.388
She rip and run.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.258
She burn through a lot
of dealers that way.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.027
They must have been pissed.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.161
Anyone after her?

11:01.194 --> 11:02.362
They all
after her, man.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.097
What you think?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.968
Hi.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.903
We're Detective Adams
and Suarez.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.905
We're here
to speak with Tyler.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.442
Can we come in?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.244
Yeah. It, uh...

11:17.277 --> 11:18.478
it's kind of a mess.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.781
Uh, midterms
are coming up, but...

11:28.155 --> 11:30.791
Looks like Tyler doesn't
spend much time here.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.960
I've never even met the guy.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.867
Yes, I have it right here.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.369
Tyler lives in Hayden Hall,
suite 12E.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.772
No, he doesn't,
and you know that.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.873
Excuse me?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.007
We went to suite 12E,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.475
and the guy that
does live there

11:48.508 --> 11:49.910
says that Tyler
lives off campus

11:49.943 --> 11:53.080
and he drives to
school in an Escalade.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.148
Mallorie, the L.A.
Times is here.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.385
We provided on-campus housing

11:58.418 --> 11:59.953
as part of Tyler's
scholarship.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.288
Uh, if he chooses

12:01.321 --> 12:03.791
to live elsewhere,
that's his business.

12:03.791 --> 12:04.524
I want that address.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.795
We seem to be
miscommunicating.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.162
I don't believe
for one second

12:09.196 --> 12:11.064
the football team
doesn't know where he lives.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.099
Detective,
I'm trying to cooperate.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.033
No, you're not.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
You're stonewalling me,

12:14.434 --> 12:15.803
and you're impeding
the investigation

12:15.836 --> 12:17.404
of a murder
of one of your students.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.307
Okay, first of all,
Nicole wasn't even a student

12:20.340 --> 12:22.275
at S.U.L.A. anymore.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.145
She was academically
disqualified

12:25.178 --> 12:26.546
for not maintaining
her GPA.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.049
The letter went out
two days ago.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.417
You're abandoning this girl

12:30.450 --> 12:32.152
in order to protect
a football player

12:32.185 --> 12:33.420
who has an arrest record

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
and a history of
violence against women?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.824
That charge was dropped.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.459
Okay.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.494
If you don't want
to give me Tyler's address,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.564
I'll just pull him off the field
in the middle of Saturday's game

12:44.597 --> 12:46.433
and interrogate him
right there,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.468
in full view of the cameras.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.471
Pull Tyler off the field
in the middle of a game?

12:51.504 --> 12:52.973
Not even a suspect.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.975
I got the address.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.478
I can't follow you.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.981
One minute, you're mad at
Nicole for blowing it all,

13:01.014 --> 13:02.515
and then, the next,
you're defending her

13:02.549 --> 13:04.517
against a football player
we haven't even met.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.519
That's 'cause
I can't stand the lying

13:06.553 --> 13:08.355
and the covering up.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.290
I mean, look
at this place.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.360
This beautiful campus
in the middle of the ghetto.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.095
When I was in high school,

13:15.128 --> 13:17.130
my bus used to pass
by here every day,

13:17.164 --> 13:19.432
and it might as well have
been Buckingham Palace.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.501
You can look, but
you can't go in.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.871
Well, Nicole got in,
and she deserves

13:23.871 --> 13:25.438
just as much protection
as Tyler.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.575
You're a fascinating woman,
you know that?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.979
Shut up.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.450
BEN:
Dewey tell you what he wants
to make up to you for?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.487
Besides being a dick
for the past five years?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.589
Chickie's the one he needs
to make amends to.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.891
Well, he's been
begging her

13:43.924 --> 13:45.893
to come out,
and she won't.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.295
I don't blame her.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.562
You know how many people

13:49.596 --> 13:52.532
are going to watch
that video on YouTube?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.935
Yeah.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.937
You know, before he was
an abusive alcoholic,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.538
Dewey was a good cop.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.040
Really?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.241
He was.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.343
He was a great cop.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.545
I mean, the guy
was never the guy

14:05.578 --> 14:07.514
you'd want to invite
over to your house

14:07.547 --> 14:08.415
for a weekend barbecue.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.616
(chuckling)

14:09.649 --> 14:11.584
Unless you're
freaking sick.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.587
But if you were going
into a situation,

14:14.621 --> 14:17.390
you'd be glad it was Dewey
that had your back.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.493
(hip-hop music,
video game noise blaring)

14:20.527 --> 14:22.029
Oh, man, that's too bad.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.296
Old girl was fine.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.497
Your girlfriend was murdered,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.566
and all you can say
is she was fine?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.936
(men chuckling)

14:30.070 --> 14:31.671
We need to speak
in private.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.473
Ah, these are my boys.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.409
What you got to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.677
Come on, man,
get that.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.346
(shuts off music)

14:39.379 --> 14:41.949
All your boys can get out.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.388
All right, homey,
I'm out.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.091
(snapping fingers rapidly)

14:56.129 --> 14:58.966
So, I heard that you and Nicole
were dating for a while.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.368
Yeah, me and Nicole
hung out for a minute.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.203
I cut her loose.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.537
Why?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.540
Nicole was cool
till she got into that blow.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.309
Couldn't have that around me.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.577
Got a career to protect.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.045
Where'd she get
the blow from?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.114
Dig that!

15:14.147 --> 15:15.548
Get it, get it.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.284
Turn the game off now.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.187
(clears throat)

15:20.220 --> 15:21.721
That you on
the game, man?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.590
Yeah, that's me.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.092
Except my ratings
should be higher, man.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.994
I'm way faster than that, yo.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.662
That Oregon game,
you were on fire, man.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.700
You saw that, huh?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.468
Lost 300 bucks on that game.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.270
You's pretty fast.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.040
Fast with them
hands, too.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.441
Saw you got
suspended

15:41.474 --> 15:44.311
two games last year
for assaulting a woman.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.714
Like to get rough
with the ladies, huh?

15:49.082 --> 15:52.019
That assault charge
was fake, man.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.553
Bitch was all over me.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.623
I got a... I have a right
to protect myself.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.691
They should have kicked
your ass off the team.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.060
(chuckles)

16:00.093 --> 16:01.461
The season I'm having?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
Ain't no way.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.564
We're four games away

16:04.597 --> 16:06.299
from the BCS
championship, baby.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.601
(doorbell rings)

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
Can you get that, bro?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.076
Man.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.314
(Tyler sighs)

16:21.348 --> 16:22.682
(door opens)

16:22.715 --> 16:24.451
There he is.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.187
Detectives, I'm Joe Cosaboom,
campus general counsel.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.755
Who called you?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.223
I understand you're
investigating

16:30.257 --> 16:31.591
the murder of a
former student.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.393
Why are you
talking to Tyler?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.261
He knew her.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.628
Fine.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.231
I'm here so Tyler
knows he's free

16:38.265 --> 16:40.567
to answer your questions,
but doesn't have to.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.734
All this
special treatment,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.803
and you don't even
carry the ball.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.338
Where were you last night?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.774
Last night... let me see.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.776
Last night,
I was right here, man.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.578
Just where I was supposed to be.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.812
Anybody else
with you?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.148
Nah, I was kicking it solo.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.084
Got a game on Saturday.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.751
Curfew's 9:00.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.188
You expect us to believe
that you were here

17:01.221 --> 17:03.090
at 9:00 p.m. on a Sunday night?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.259
Baby, you can
come over tonight

17:06.293 --> 17:08.461
and, uh, see for
yourself if you want to.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.548
Now you know why
he doesn't want to leave.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.117
(chuckling):
Yeah.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.356
Oh, my God.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.824
Oh, my God!

17:37.857 --> 17:39.192
Okay!
(laughs)

17:39.226 --> 17:41.261
I knew you would come, baby.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.130
I knew you would come.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.664
I told everybody
about you guys.
Hey, what's up?

17:44.697 --> 17:45.765
Hey, you want some coffee? Huh?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.334
No, thanks.
You guys good?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.868
Yeah.
Yeah.
Check this place out, huh?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.637
Is this awesome or what?

17:50.670 --> 17:52.405
It's bright, it's clean.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.840
I got fresh flowers
all the time.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.508
And my man, Bobby, takes
cares of us. Right, Bobby?

17:55.542 --> 17:56.276
Whatever you say
there, YouTube.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.577
YouTube, man!

17:57.610 --> 17:59.312
They call me YouTube
around the place.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.181
No kidding.
Well, I mean,
it's not like

18:01.214 --> 18:03.150
Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan
hang around the joint, right?

18:03.150 --> 18:04.684
I mean, I'm the closest
thing to a celebrity

18:04.717 --> 18:06.186
this place has to offer.
Come on, baby.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.820
Come on!
(laughs)

18:11.524 --> 18:13.726
LYDIA:
So, we can't speak
to the head coach,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.495
but we can speak
to the assistant coach--

18:15.528 --> 18:17.164
with a lawyer?
That's correct.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.365
I'm the one
that deals

18:18.398 --> 18:20.367
with the players
outside the field.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.202
Did Tyler make his curfew
last night?

18:22.235 --> 18:24.837
Yeah. I spoke with him
a little bit after 9:00.

18:24.871 --> 18:25.705
In person?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.307
I call the players.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.676
Did you call him on his
cell or on his landline?

18:29.709 --> 18:30.843
Tyler doesn't have a landline.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.845
I talked to him
on his cell phone.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.781
You call me right
now on my cell

18:34.814 --> 18:36.483
and ask me, "Are
you in Tahiti?"

18:36.516 --> 18:38.451
I can say, "Yeah,
I'm in Tahiti."

18:38.485 --> 18:39.819
You got a problem
with Tyler's alibi,

18:39.852 --> 18:41.488
get a warrant for his phone.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.755
This interview's over.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.292
I can't even tell you.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.626
It's like a giant weight

18:46.659 --> 18:48.361
has just been lifted
off my shoulders

18:48.395 --> 18:49.696
and I feel great.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.830
You look...
you look great.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.299
Right?
Yeah, you do.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.766
Come on. Huh?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.302
Hey.
(sighs)

18:55.335 --> 18:57.337
I want you
to ask me something.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.838
Anything. Anything you want.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.541
About what?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.775
About my
disease.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.345
About how I let it
wreck my whole life.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.879
I mean, come on, John.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.681
I don't want
to have any more secrets.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.550
I'm only as sick as my secrets.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.885
If I don't have any secrets,
I'm not sick anymore.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.423
Okay.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.225
I mean, don't you
want to know

19:18.225 --> 19:19.292
how much I was
drinking?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.460
Sure.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.297
Well, on a work day,

19:24.331 --> 19:26.733
I put away six to 12 beers
in the morning.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.369
Come home and
have another 20.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.773
You were drinking
30 beers a day?

19:33.806 --> 19:35.608
On a work day.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.377
More if I wasn't.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.280
I could polish off a half
a gallon of vodka by myself.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.848
I mean, you guys
have to understand.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.450
I-I would wake up
in the morning

19:43.483 --> 19:44.884
shaking so bad,
I-I couldn't walk.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.354
I mean, I'd have to get
six to 12 beers in me

19:47.387 --> 19:49.589
just to steady my hand so
I could brush my teeth.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.957
How long did this go on for?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.627
Five, six years.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.297
How the hell did you
let it go on for that long?
John...

19:57.330 --> 19:59.932
Five or six years?!
Hold it. Hold it.
It's all right.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.201
He's mad at me.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.538
That's real.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.977
Want to take a swing
at me, John?

20:12.279 --> 20:13.746
All right.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.947
If you want to
knock me out,

20:14.981 --> 20:16.316
come on.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.884
No, I'm serious
right now.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.786
Hit me.
Sit down, Dewey.

20:19.819 --> 20:20.953
Come on, I'm serious.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.555
Crack me one.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.659
Sit down.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.902
I'm going to get some coffee.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.004
You want something?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.540
No.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.278
LYDIA:
So, Tyler told us

20:45.312 --> 20:48.948
that Nicole and he
just hung out.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.283
Tyler's a liar.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.618
I barely saw her.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.653
She slept at his place,
like, all the time.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.655
Did she do drugs with him?

20:57.023 --> 20:59.926
He'd take her to, like,
trendy nightclubs.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.628
There'd be
free champagne

21:01.661 --> 21:02.862
and coke
on platters.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.334
When did she stop
going to classes?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.035
A couple months ago.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.704
I tried to get her
help, but there's

21:11.738 --> 21:13.506
no drug counseling
program here.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.041
They just gave us
pamphlets.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.009
Pamphlets?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.879
School has a lawyer
on every corner for Tyler

21:19.912 --> 21:22.048
and no protection
for Nicole.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.351
Guess track doesn't pay
as much as football.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.988
When did she start doing crack?

21:29.021 --> 21:31.658
Uh, like, when Tyler
broke up with her.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.560
She lost
a lot of weight.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.897
And a couple weeks ago,

21:37.930 --> 21:41.701
I came home, and she had my iPod
and some jewelry...

21:41.734 --> 21:44.036
She was going
to sell it?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.738
GIRL:
I yelled at her.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.408
I told her to get out.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.377
I should've helped her.
She was my friend.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.080
Thanks for coming.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.915
Dewey talks about you guys
all the time.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.784
Get you a cup of coffee?
No.
No.

21:57.817 --> 21:58.951
Okay, cool.
I'm all right.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.954
Hey, guys, my name is Glen,

22:01.988 --> 22:03.956
and I'm an alcoholic.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.625
ALL:
Hey, Glen.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.093
I'd like to get started
today with Dewey.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.928
He's got a couple visitors.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.930
Dewey.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.700
Uh, I'm Dewey, and
I'm an alcoholic.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.668
Yeah. Yeah.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.604
These are the two guys
I've been telling you about.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.406
This is, uh,
John and Ben.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.709
They're pretty much the reason
why I'm here.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.945
Uh, John, uh...

22:27.046 --> 22:29.882
...John sort of
saved my life.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.884
Yeah.

22:31.918 --> 22:35.588
He made my partner turn me in
when I was drinking on the job.

22:35.622 --> 22:36.956
Uh...

22:39.025 --> 22:42.529
If it wasn't for this guy,
I'd be just another drunk

22:42.562 --> 22:45.598
driving around
the streets of L.A.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.435
So, I just wanted to
say thank you, John.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.505
I love this guy.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.840
DEWEY:
Wow. John.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.442
(applause)

22:58.878 --> 23:00.847
(exhaling)

23:00.880 --> 23:03.450
So, John, would you like
to say something

23:03.450 --> 23:05.452
in support of, uh,
Dewey's recovery?

23:16.195 --> 23:17.830
They got to you, too?

23:17.864 --> 23:20.099
Unless you can find something
to tie him to the murder,

23:20.132 --> 23:21.934
I don't want to hear
any more about him.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.570
We need a viable
suspect.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.104
What've you got?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.807
She did a bunch of rip and
runs in the neighborhood.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.476
We're trying to
get some names.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.010
No one's
talking yet.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.112
What're you doing here?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.947
Well, I don't know if
you've noticed, Detective,

23:34.981 --> 23:37.149
but this murder has generated
quite a lot of press.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.685
I did notice.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.720
I saw all those news trucks
in South Central

23:40.753 --> 23:43.022
and I thought, "White person
must've lost their dog."

23:43.055 --> 23:44.991
(muffled chuckle)

23:46.058 --> 23:48.027
I want this case closed.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.996
You want me to approve overtime?

23:50.029 --> 23:51.531
Done.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.566
You want resources,
just tell me what you need.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.234
But bring me the shooter.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.837
Hey, go like this, you got
something on your face.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.972
Right here.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.908
Right here. Oh,
still there, man.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.910
(laughs)
Hilarious.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.077
You know that?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.079
Feels good
to be riding today.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.748
Instead of cooped up

24:08.781 --> 24:11.250
in a surveillance van
with that loudmouth.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.219
Ah, come on,
Gil's all right.

24:13.252 --> 24:16.188
Just gotta get used
to him, you know.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.793
Hey, there's Casper.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.796
Pull over.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.798
Hey, Casper!

24:25.832 --> 24:27.800
Where you goin' man?

24:27.834 --> 24:29.769
What's up, Sammy?

24:29.802 --> 24:30.937
What're you doin'?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.672
Why aren't you
in school?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.541
CASPER:
Substitute teacher.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.644
You hear anything about that
girl who got shot last night?

24:37.677 --> 24:39.746
Put me in cuffs, Sammy.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.748
What?

24:41.781 --> 24:43.215
You're not even a banger.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.218
Come on, Sammy, just
make it look good.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.220
Turn around.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.556
Spread your legs.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.823
Spread 'em out.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.560
Put your hands up
behind your head.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.795
Just hold it.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.830
Put me in the car.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.699
Better tell me something

24:59.732 --> 25:01.668
or I'm gonna kiss you
on the lips.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.676
That girl who got killed,
they called her "The Runner."

25:09.709 --> 25:11.711
Yeah, yeah, she
did rip and runs.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.680
Who'd she do 'em to?
K-Dog.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.047
He's around my age.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.816
Down with Avalon Street.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.619
Been talking about how
he's gonna smoke the bitch.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.823
You-you don't want
to talk?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.792
Huh?!

25:25.825 --> 25:27.293
Come on.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.261
Next time I'll take you
down to the station.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.799
Get back to school.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.266
Later, Sammy!

25:34.300 --> 25:35.802
Pull your pants up.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.771
Officer, officer,
you gotta help me.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.773
Every time I come home
from work,

25:40.807 --> 25:42.108
there are these ho's
in my house.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.676
I don't want them
there no more.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.911
Who's lettin' them in?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.813
My husband!

25:48.114 --> 25:49.916
Thanks, Nate.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.884
Let us know
what you find.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.688
Gang unit's got a lead
on a dealer.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.323
Just got back
from the coroners.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.258
And they found cocaine
in Nicole Hill's body.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.260
I wish I could say
I was surprised, Kenny.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.863
And they also found out that
she was seven weeks pregnant.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.865
She was pregnant?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.333
There's your motive.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.868
If it's his baby.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.704
Seven weeks ago, Nicole
and Tyler were together.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.740
He felt threatened
by the baby,

26:13.773 --> 26:14.974
and he didn't want
to support her.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.245
Hi. We're Detectives
Adams and Suarez.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.714
Are you parents home?

26:21.748 --> 26:25.084
My parents went to the funeral
home to make arrangements.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.054
Can we ask you
some questions?

26:34.727 --> 26:36.996
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

26:37.029 --> 26:39.065
Month and a
half ago.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.668
Nicole insisted I go to
this fancy restaurant

26:41.701 --> 26:43.670
with her and Tyler.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.672
(sarcastic chuckle)
She wanted to
impress me.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.674
You know that Nicole
was doing drugs?

26:47.674 --> 26:49.676
Yes.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.910
We all did.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.780
My parents were
in denial.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.115
Especially my dad.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.349
Did you confront
Nicole about it?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.953
No.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.255
And I should've.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.225
Nicole and I weren't close.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.128
She hated me for being perfect.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.798
My dad pushed
her so hard

27:11.831 --> 27:12.932
to follow in my footsteps.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.266
She didn't even want to run.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.702
Did your father know that?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.003
Of course he did.

27:18.104 --> 27:21.073
Don't you get it?

27:21.107 --> 27:24.043
I only won a bronze
in the Olympics.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.114
Dad wanted a gold.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.022
DEWEY:
Boots, you in here?

27:36.055 --> 27:38.024
Dewey?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.859
Uh, yeah, yeah, man.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.861
(clears throat)
Uh...

27:41.894 --> 27:43.863
you know I did a lot
of stupid

27:43.896 --> 27:45.865
and reckless things
back on the job.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.333
I was drinking...
Yeah, look, man,

27:47.366 --> 27:48.868
just, uh, you know what?

27:48.901 --> 27:50.837
Just give me...

27:51.938 --> 27:53.740
Hey.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.742
I was just saying that,
uh, you know,

27:55.775 --> 27:57.744
I did a lot of things
that I regret.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.378
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Everyone's just happy

27:59.411 --> 28:00.913
that you're taking care
of yourself, all right.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.348
All right?
(sighs)

28:02.381 --> 28:05.351
You know, one of the worst
things that I did was...

28:05.384 --> 28:08.354
when I didn't let you
search that gangbanger.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.123
You know, when you
wanted to and, uh,

28:11.157 --> 28:13.192
of course we all found
out he had a gun.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.260
Bastard shot me with it.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.262
Yeah, it's okay.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.964
Look, just let me
finish, okay?

28:17.997 --> 28:20.933
I'm-I'm trying to make
amends with you.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.969
It was your first
day on the job

28:23.002 --> 28:25.972
and because of my
poor judgment,

28:26.005 --> 28:28.440
you had to bring
somebody down.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.477
Even though the bastard
deserved it, uh...

28:31.510 --> 28:33.512
probably wouldn't
have happened

28:33.545 --> 28:36.783
if it wasn't for me.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.786
Yeah, yeah, look, I...

28:39.786 --> 28:42.254
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.924
But, uh, I--

28:44.957 --> 28:46.826
It's okay, man.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.795
I accept.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.333
It's not like I asked you
to marry me.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.273
(both laugh)

29:01.307 --> 29:03.409
LYDIA:
Mr. Hill, Nicole
was pregnant.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.244
Did she tell you who
the father was?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.213
HILL:
No. Was it Tyler?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.215
We don't know.
And we can't get a DNA sample

29:09.248 --> 29:11.283
without probable cause and
right now we don't have it.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.119
Oh, well, then you
all need to do

29:13.152 --> 29:14.553
whatever it takes
to get it.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.555
I mean, that's why
he killed her.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.558
He just didn't want her
to have his baby.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.560
We're pursuing
a lead

29:21.593 --> 29:24.030
that Nicole was stealing
crack from a dealer.

29:24.063 --> 29:27.333
Hey, my daughter
did not do drugs!

29:27.366 --> 29:28.835
I'm afraid she was,
Mr. Hill.
No, no.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.269
Nicole did not do drugs.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.871
She did not steal.
She was not some crack whore.

29:31.904 --> 29:32.972
She was an elite
athlete.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.473
She had Olympic
potential!

29:34.506 --> 29:36.475
You had no idea
who Nicole was...
Who the hell are you

29:36.508 --> 29:39.145
to think you can tell me
who my child was?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.147
Let's go.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.916
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Hill.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.218
You're trying to blame everyone
for this girl's downfall.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.888
It's the school, it's Tyler,
it's her dad.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.890
I'm not saying
she wasn't a part of it.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.892
I'm just frustrated.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.894
I hear you.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.495
And I really can't get over

29:56.528 --> 29:58.497
the fact that she didn't
even want to run.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.499
Why?

30:00.532 --> 30:04.236
When I run, it feels like the
most natural thing I can do.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.406
Well, it might be that for you,
but it wasn't for her.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.241
Yeah, well, maybe
it would've been,

30:09.275 --> 30:11.110
if her dad didn't
push her so hard.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.145
Hmm. Hmm.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.446
Your pop still
in the picture?

30:14.480 --> 30:17.449
No. Just me and my mom.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.852
Must be proud of you.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.623
So now instead of
30 beers a day,

30:24.656 --> 30:27.326
Dewey's drinking 30 cups
of coffee a day.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.261
Gonna be fun to ride with.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.904
This friend of yours,

30:37.937 --> 30:40.472
he die in the line
of duty?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.508
No.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.510
Was he sick?

30:44.543 --> 30:46.345
No.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.314
My ex-wife's going
to be there.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.551
Like to meet her.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.125
This is Club Elysium
out in Studio City.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.127
Recognize this guy?
Yeah, Tyler Prescott.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.261
And he lied.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.462
The time stamp says 11:32.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.663
That means he broke
his curfew.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.298
He could've been
at that party.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.400
NATE:
And we know this guy.
His name's, uh--

31:08.434 --> 31:10.002
his name's Sisco.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.137
He was at Tyler's
place today.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.939
Who's he run with?
Avalons.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.941
Mid-level guy,
he's an enforcer.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.475
I bet you anything
he knows

31:16.508 --> 31:19.511
that dealer K-Dog
we're looking for.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.581
I didn't have anything to do
with what happened to Nicole.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.083
Neither did Tyler.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.584
When'd you find out
she was pregnant?

31:25.617 --> 31:27.119
Pregnant?

31:27.153 --> 31:29.021
Definitely didn't
know that shit.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.222
Come on, man.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.523
Tyler wanted Nicole
out of the picture.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.692
You put one of your baby
bangers up to it.

31:33.725 --> 31:37.063
Everybody know Nicole got lit up
'cause she was stealin'.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.131
Stealing from K-Dog?

31:39.165 --> 31:41.100
Is he one of yours?

31:42.201 --> 31:44.270
(sighing):
Oh, man.

31:44.303 --> 31:51.677
(music plays over radio)

31:51.710 --> 31:53.980
And if he is?

31:54.013 --> 31:55.681
Then you need to tell us
where to find him.

31:55.714 --> 31:56.582
What you gonna
do for me?

31:56.615 --> 31:58.017
What?

31:58.050 --> 31:59.085
I tell you what
you want to know,

31:59.118 --> 32:00.352
what you gonna
do for me?

32:00.386 --> 32:02.021
I'll tell you
what we'll do for you.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.322
We'll walk out of here
without arresting your ass.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.456
That's what we'll do.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.992
What you gonna
arrest me for?

32:06.025 --> 32:09.095
You miss a court date
last month, Sisco?

32:09.128 --> 32:11.530
Owe your baby mama
some child support?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.570
Little pooh-butt.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.307
All I said to him was "Don't
let her get over on you."

32:21.340 --> 32:23.375
I didn't tell him
to smoke the bitch.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.045
Where does he hang?

32:26.078 --> 32:28.747
*

32:28.780 --> 32:33.085
On the corner over
on 51st and Beaudry.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.454
Keep a nine-millimeter
in the baby stroller.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.579
Is that your
friend's wife?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.281
Yeah.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.118
MINISTER:
Good afternoon.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.353
We are here today
to celebrate

33:07.386 --> 33:09.655
the life of Clark Henlen,

33:09.688 --> 33:13.392
a beloved husband,
a doting father,

33:13.425 --> 33:18.130
a trusted colleague,
and a dear friend to many.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.399
(sobbing)
Clark and Wendy started
coming to our church

33:20.432 --> 33:23.502
when their son Dylan
was born.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.804
I remember Clark telling me
he hadn't been to a church

33:25.837 --> 33:27.706
since he was a child,

33:27.739 --> 33:30.509
but having his own child
made him want to be connected

33:30.542 --> 33:33.079
to something bigger
than himself.

33:33.079 --> 33:37.416
(phone ringing)

33:37.449 --> 33:38.317
Adams.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.286
You have to stop him.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.454
My father's going to kill him,
my father's going to kill Tyler.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.722
Whoa, wait,
wait, calm down.

33:43.755 --> 33:44.723
Is this Michelle?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.358
Yes, yes.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.659
My father got a gun

33:47.693 --> 33:49.628
and he went
to Tyler's apartment.

33:49.661 --> 33:50.696
I tried to stop him.

33:50.729 --> 33:51.730
All right,
we're on our way.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.400
You drive.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.738
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:59.771 --> 34:01.440
Beige Pontiac on the left.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.709
Driver's seat.

34:12.851 --> 34:16.255
Mr. Hill, turn off the
ignition, open the door,

34:16.288 --> 34:18.757
and step out of the car.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.530
Turn off the vehicle.
All right, all right,
I'm doing it.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.299
(engine stops)

34:34.506 --> 34:37.176
Turn around and put your hands
behind your head.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.419
What is this about?

34:47.453 --> 34:48.720
This is so humiliating.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.755
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about that

34:49.788 --> 34:52.424
before you picked up a gun.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.835
What were you thinking?

35:03.869 --> 35:05.804
I wasn't.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.175
I just, uh...

35:12.244 --> 35:15.414
(sobbing):
I didn't know
what else to do.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.816
I just want
my daughter back.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.886
I just...

35:20.919 --> 35:24.256
I'll call your wife
when we get to the station.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.861
(sighs)

35:29.895 --> 35:32.198
I'm so glad
you came.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.265
We've missed you.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.466
Well, L.A. keeps me busy.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.468
Yeah.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.704
This is, uh,

35:38.737 --> 35:41.373
my partner
Ben Sherman.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.641
We work together.

35:42.674 --> 35:43.909
I'm sorry for your loss.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.478
Thank you.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.646
Hey, how you doing?

35:48.814 --> 35:50.782
My name is John.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.751
I knew your dad.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.231
SAMMY:
Stroller.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.932
He's going for something
in the bag.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.572
NATE:
Los Angeles Police!
Put your hands in the air!

36:22.314 --> 36:23.415
(gunshot, yelling)

36:24.783 --> 36:25.817
(baby fussing)

36:25.851 --> 36:27.519
(both grunting)

36:29.288 --> 36:31.457
Let me go, man, I got to take
care of my baby brother.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.325
You keep a gun
in his diaper bag?!

36:33.359 --> 36:34.760
He needs a bottle--
that's why he's crying.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.462
You think
that's taking care of him?!

36:36.495 --> 36:39.365
(baby crying)

36:39.398 --> 36:41.367
You're a (bleep) idiot,
you know that?

36:41.400 --> 36:43.402
Huh?

36:43.435 --> 36:44.403
Come on.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.273
(mumbling)

36:48.374 --> 36:50.342
All right.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.343
(sighs)

36:51.377 --> 36:54.280
You're all right, man.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.748
Hi.
Hey.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.591
Laurie, this is Ben.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.025
BOTH:
Hi.
Ben, this is
my ex-wife Laurie.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.495
It's good
to meet you.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.796
Well, I thought
they handled that

37:10.829 --> 37:12.531
as gracefully
as they could.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.301
Yeah, it was
a nice service.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.002
Yeah.
How's Wendy?

37:17.035 --> 37:18.637
She's doing okay.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.707
Um, I don't know what
she's told the kids.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.310
How do you tell a kid
your dad killed himself?

37:24.310 --> 37:26.445
It's best
to keep it simple.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.614
I guess it's a good thing
that Wendy found him.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.983
It's just--
it's sad, John.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.057
I'm gonna go be
with her, okay?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.326
It was nice
to meet you.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.993
Nice to meet you.

37:43.462 --> 37:47.032
So your...
friend killed himself?

37:47.065 --> 37:51.337
Yeah, he shot himself
in their garage.

37:52.704 --> 37:56.342
You have any
idea why?

37:56.342 --> 37:58.810
Let's hit the gas station
before we get on the highway.

38:01.913 --> 38:02.948
Where's my
brother at?

38:02.981 --> 38:04.550
He's fine.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.418
You don't need to worry
about him right now.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.786
You need to worry
about yourself.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.054
I am worried
about myself.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.089
My mom is gonna kill
me if she come home

38:11.122 --> 38:12.558
and the baby
ain't there.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.793
Look, I can see
that you're a good kid

38:14.826 --> 38:17.028
and I'm trying to do
everything I can to help you,

38:17.062 --> 38:19.631
but I got a problem.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.401
This ballistics report
right here--

38:22.434 --> 38:24.470
it says the gun
that we found on you

38:24.503 --> 38:26.104
was the same one
that killed Nicole.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.473
I ain't killed nobody.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.476
Not according
to Sisco.

38:30.509 --> 38:33.879
He said you were embarrassed
that she was stealing from you.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.815
You told everybody
you were going to kill her.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.049
Sisco ain't say that.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.818
Yes, he did.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.389
He said all the kids
were laughing at you,

38:43.422 --> 38:45.724
making fun of you,

38:45.757 --> 38:47.125
and you just
couldn't take it anymore.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.760
That ain't true.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.762
Sisco told me
to smoke the bitch.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.498
I so want to believe you, K-Dog.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.132
He knew she would
be at the party.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.601
He told me to
do it there,

38:55.634 --> 38:57.068
said he'd make sure
nobody snitched.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.771
Did he say anything
about Tyler Prescott?

38:59.805 --> 39:01.407
No.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.874
Are you sure
he didn't say anything

39:02.908 --> 39:04.910
like you'd be doing Tyler
a favor?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.979
No, look,
Sisco said this bitch was fast,

39:08.013 --> 39:09.080
but she couldn't outrun
a bullet.

39:09.114 --> 39:12.050
I didn't want
to kill her.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.786
I-I tried to shoot
her in the leg,

39:14.820 --> 39:18.424
so she couldn't
run, but...

39:18.457 --> 39:20.726
But what?

39:20.759 --> 39:23.562
But I missed.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.113
Not a bad first day,
huh, partner?

39:42.147 --> 39:44.082
Not bad.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.887
Catch you tomorrow.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.457
All right.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.962
(sighs)

39:59.030 --> 40:02.200
Ex-wife seems cool.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.068
How long
you guys married?

40:03.101 --> 40:05.170
Five years.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.912
When Clark was
still in L.A.,

40:13.945 --> 40:15.747
we'd go on double
dates together--

40:15.781 --> 40:18.416
he and Wendy and
me and Laurie.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.856
After Laurie and I split up,
I'd see Clark out at gay bars.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.593
He'd ignore me.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.062
Couple months later,

40:31.096 --> 40:34.766
he and Wendy moved out to
Indian Wells and had kids.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.970
Anyway...

40:40.872 --> 40:43.642
I appreciate you coming today.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.684
Long day.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.123
Hell, yes.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.103
Hey, Mom.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.105
Yeah.

41:14.139 --> 41:17.108
No, I-- no,
I-I know it's late, I...

41:17.142 --> 41:20.178
I'm fine.

41:20.211 --> 41:25.050
Because I... I just wanted
to say that, um...

41:28.119 --> 41:31.289
...that I know you made a lot

41:44.169 --> 41:53.612
And how's France?
