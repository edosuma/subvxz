00:54.400 --> 00:58.270
<i>When our descendants ask us
in the future what our generation</i>

00:58.270 --> 01:03.000
<i>bad done for them and
what we had achieved for our country,</i>

01:03.600 --> 01:08.140
<i>let us proudly answer them,
without any hesitation that we labored</i>

01:08.140 --> 01:11.630
<i>again and again with faith
in the modernization of our country.</i>

02:13.910 --> 02:18.210
Man... what the fuck.
He's not picking up?

02:18.310 --> 02:19.510
Nope.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.040
That fucking bastard.
He's pulling out.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.380
What do we do?

02:26.490 --> 02:29.460
What else can we do?
We should break in.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.720
But the door's locked.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.530
Shit.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.190
- Hey, you have the key?
- How would I have the key?

02:45.710 --> 02:49.300
- OK. Try calling him again.
- Alright...

02:50.610 --> 02:52.910
The fucker must be
inside there somewhere!

02:57.890 --> 02:59.080
Is it locked?

03:01.190 --> 03:03.680
Sir.
Don't get anything from here.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.260
The owner's a greedy one,
he doesn't even pay us.

03:26.410 --> 03:27.440
Hello?

03:30.750 --> 03:33.520
Hey, sorry but I don't think
I'll make it.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.750
I'm still in training.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.090
I said I can't today.

03:45.470 --> 03:47.260
My co-worker's coming.
Sorry.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.800
- Did anyone stop by?
- Nope.

03:51.270 --> 03:52.640
Thank God.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.540
The bus stopped on my way,
so I came running here.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.580
I'm not the late type,
but it's easy to be late around here.

04:12.190 --> 04:16.720
- It's okay right?
- Yeah, it's okay.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.300
You came early?

04:21.640 --> 04:23.470
No, I just came on time.

04:24.270 --> 04:25.700
Are you from around here?

04:27.170 --> 04:28.270
No.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.840
Then how did you find this work?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.440
A friend who used to work
here introduced me.

04:36.650 --> 04:39.640
Sounds good.
We don't get too many people here.

04:39.990 --> 04:41.620
There's nothing hard
about the work, really.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.490
Just get to work on time,
that's all.

04:49.730 --> 04:54.190
Hey... don't tell the boss that
I was late today. Just between us.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.230
But you're gonna quit anyways.

04:59.940 --> 05:02.910
It's always good to leave on
a clean note.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.850
Hey, can you teach me
how to balance the accounts?

05:11.150 --> 05:14.050
- I didn't teach you that already?
- Nope.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.660
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.900
Press this button to check the prices
when you're balancing the accounts.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.130
I wish all this money were mine.

05:37.650 --> 05:41.710
- You like money?
- Who doesn't?

05:42.720 --> 05:43.840
You don't?

05:43.920 --> 05:45.220
Yeah, I do.

05:52.230 --> 05:56.720
If a customer checks out,
then you press this button to calculate.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.930
- Try it.
- Yeah.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.140
That'll be 5,000 won.

06:07.310 --> 06:09.110
- Hey.
- Yes?

06:09.580 --> 06:11.100
No.
I'm talking about you, lady.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.250
Me?

06:13.250 --> 06:14.680
Who do you think I am?

06:15.050 --> 06:17.110
Why are you using me
to explain things to him?

06:17.220 --> 06:18.910
Is this how you work?

06:20.220 --> 06:21.490
Where's the owner?

06:21.490 --> 06:23.620
- Tell him to come out!
- What?

06:23.760 --> 06:25.090
You're the owner?

06:25.990 --> 06:27.120
We're really sorry.

06:30.230 --> 06:34.960
You think getting paid's a joke?
Let's get something straight, alright?

06:35.740 --> 06:40.500
It's all about keeping it real
in this world. You got that?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.940
We're really sorry.
Good-bye.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.940
What was that about?

06:52.250 --> 06:53.520
What do you mean.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.950
<i>- What did you apologize for?
- Sorry?</i>

06:58.430 --> 07:01.160
Do you always say
sorry that easily?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.690
I'm sorry.

07:05.330 --> 07:09.270
- For what again?
- For saying sorry.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.670
Hey... I'm going out smoking.
I'll be back.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.890
Alright.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.520
<i>Why don't you pick up your phone?</i>

07:56.520 --> 07:59.750
I told you not to call again.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.280
<i>Can't we just meet
and talk over this?</i>

08:02.460 --> 08:05.120
How many times do
I have to tell you, it's over!

08:05.760 --> 08:07.730
I'm so sick of it.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.920
You, and this place...

08:11.270 --> 08:12.460
<i>Hana...</i>

08:13.800 --> 08:16.000
I should've never come here
in the first place.

08:18.610 --> 08:20.160
Don't call me ever again.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.930
Are you done yet?

08:49.340 --> 08:50.630
Look.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.140
Do you like it?

08:59.410 --> 09:01.640
<i>Hey, you look really pretty.</i>

09:01.780 --> 09:03.150
Hana, you look prettier.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.980
No really.
You're much, much prettier. Really.

09:07.290 --> 09:10.220
You're the prettiest
of all the girls I've seen.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.530
There's something on your face...

09:58.170 --> 10:02.340
Okay, okay.
Just for a little bit, okay?

11:12.310 --> 11:14.580
I didn't know you were that angry.

11:21.690 --> 11:24.050
I'm really sorry.

11:31.230 --> 11:36.970
Hey.
I'm kind of curious.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.000
Why are you so polite to me?

11:41.380 --> 11:43.500
I feel a bit uneasy.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.150
What, being with me?

11:47.150 --> 11:50.380
No, no.
Just letting my guards off.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.210
You don't feel uneasy around me?

11:53.420 --> 11:56.410
- No, you're easy to be around with.
- Me?

11:56.860 --> 12:00.350
Just talking like this, you know.

12:09.670 --> 12:11.540
I'm famished from all the crying.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.540
Do you have a girlfriend?

12:22.220 --> 12:24.280
I shouldn't like someone right now.

12:24.380 --> 12:25.250
Why not?

12:26.390 --> 12:28.080
I'm beginning
my military service soon.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.120
How much time do you have left?

12:32.260 --> 12:33.620
3 months.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.560
That's no reason
to not like somebody.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.830
Feelings don't work that way.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.330
I have to make someone
wait for me.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.740
I don't like that, you know,
being irresponsible.

12:48.110 --> 12:52.440
So you must've thought I was irresponsible
when I kept you waiting just before.

12:53.050 --> 12:55.670
21 minutes is different
from 21 months.

12:55.820 --> 12:57.880
How are those different?

12:58.320 --> 13:01.340
What do you think
you'll be doing in 21 minutes?

13:02.090 --> 13:05.290
Who knows.
Maybe here...

13:07.360 --> 13:09.190
what about after 21 months?

13:10.830 --> 13:13.200
I'm not sure.

13:13.530 --> 13:14.520
Why?

13:15.100 --> 13:20.510
Wheter it's 21 minutes or 21 months,
nobody knows what's gonna happen.

13:20.940 --> 13:24.170
- Don't you think so?
- Yeah...

13:25.850 --> 13:27.840
I think it's the same
with relationships.

13:28.220 --> 13:32.550
Nobody knows what
it'll be like in 10 years, in 1 year,

13:32.550 --> 13:36.610
or 1 minute, you know.
Don't you think?

13:38.030 --> 13:41.460
But the moment you're in love,
it all feels true,

13:41.460 --> 13:44.950
so there's no room for regret
when it ends.

13:47.330 --> 13:49.640
For me, I'm always going to begin
with a clean slate no matter

13:49.640 --> 13:51.070
how many times I break up.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.240
Another customer.
You think you can do it on your own?

13:57.380 --> 13:57.930
Yeah.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.440
Then I'll go to the storage
and get the stock list.

14:13.030 --> 14:15.050
What were you talking about
with that girl?

14:16.260 --> 14:17.860
Nothing much, really.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.030
How was the audition?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.060
'Maybe next time.'

14:24.640 --> 14:26.870
You know there's not
going to be a 'next time'...

14:29.940 --> 14:33.280
There's auditions everywhere.

14:33.450 --> 14:39.390
Nobody knows what it'll be like
in 1 year or 10 years...

14:40.590 --> 14:45.620
You'll get it some day if you start out
with a clean slate every time.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.720
I've faith in you.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.120
Thanks anyway.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.430
Hyunsoo,
did you mean what you said?

15:01.980 --> 15:03.270
What do you mean?

15:03.680 --> 15:05.700
That you'll wait for me.

15:06.050 --> 15:08.610
I can bear 21 months.
It's nothing to me.

15:11.150 --> 15:13.520
You're not meeting
with someone else, are you?

15:31.340 --> 15:32.770
Hyunsoo, I love you.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.110
I wish time could stand
still right now.

15:39.310 --> 15:43.650
Hey, don't check out other guys
while you're there.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.650
I'm trusting you on this.

15:56.530 --> 15:59.270
Excuse me,
I won 500 won on these.

15:59.270 --> 16:00.160
OK...

16:03.300 --> 16:04.100
here it is.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.200
Thank you.

16:12.810 --> 16:18.250
<i>The party you're trying to call
is not available.</i>

16:18.250 --> 16:19.910
<i>Press 1 if you'd like to
leave a voice mail.</i>

16:21.590 --> 16:22.850
Hi, Mr. Chun.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.590
I need to leave early today
for an important appointment,

16:25.590 --> 16:27.230
but the next shift isn't here yet.

16:27.230 --> 16:29.320
Could you please
give me a call when you can?

16:38.870 --> 16:40.270
<i>- Yes, Mr. Chun.
- You called me?</i>

16:40.270 --> 16:42.300
Mr. Chun, I need to leave early
for today's audition.

16:42.410 --> 16:45.580
<i>There's no one else there,
so what do you mean you need to leave.</i>

16:45.580 --> 16:46.450
But the thing is...

16:46.450 --> 16:49.550
<i>If you leave now,
you won't get your pay.</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:51.350
<i>- That's that.
- Hello? Mr. Chun?</i>

17:00.560 --> 17:02.390
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

17:02.930 --> 17:05.450
I won 1,000 won with this.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.099
Would you like it in cash?

17:07.099 --> 17:10.000
No. I'll just get 2 lottery tickets
with it, please.

17:14.710 --> 17:17.109
- Alright... here you are.
- Thank you.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.619
In Jesus' name we prayed, Amen.

17:26.619 --> 17:30.960
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name...

17:30.960 --> 17:32.990
<i>- Hello?
- Where are you, Mr. Lee?</i>

17:32.990 --> 17:36.630
I'm on my way there now.
The traffic's a bit rough.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.800
<i>Your turn's coming up soon.</i>

17:38.800 --> 17:40.870
I'll be right there as soon as
I cross this light.

17:40.870 --> 17:41.960
<i>Please come here
as soon as you can.</i>

17:42.070 --> 17:46.010
I'm sorry but could you audition
other people first?

17:46.010 --> 17:48.240
<i>That's going to be difficult...</i>

17:48.240 --> 17:51.010
<i>- OK. I'll be right there.
- Please hurry up.</i>

17:53.510 --> 17:57.010
Namu amitabul gwanseum bosal...

18:02.820 --> 18:10.030
Ha, you ain't got no money?
Then fuck off.

18:10.030 --> 18:14.690
That's the rule here.
You think I don't know this town?

18:14.830 --> 18:16.860
Money rules here,

18:16.970 --> 18:20.340
so why'd I work for you
if you ain't got no money?

18:28.920 --> 18:30.350
That'll be 1,200 won.

18:33.190 --> 18:34.180
Excuse me?

18:34.290 --> 18:35.280
Excuse me!

18:36.920 --> 18:37.760
Yes?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.420
It's 1,200 won.
You gave me 1,000.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.730
I'll come back again later.

18:54.940 --> 18:59.980
Ha, you ain't got no money?
Then fuck off.

18:59.980 --> 19:04.580
That's the rule here.
You think I don't know this town?

19:05.850 --> 19:08.090
Money rules here,

19:08.090 --> 19:10.750
so why'd I work for you
if you ain't got no money?

19:11.220 --> 19:12.920
Fucking asshole.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.090
Fucking asshole...

19:22.040 --> 19:24.600
If you ain't got no money,
then fuck off.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.230
Get the fuck off!

19:29.180 --> 19:30.160
Excuse me.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.310
Again?

19:33.780 --> 19:37.310
Aren't you being a little rude?
I'm a customer, you know!

19:38.350 --> 19:41.220
I was just practicing
for my audition.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.750
So you won the lottery again?

19:45.260 --> 19:49.350
No, it's a miss.
Just give me a new one, please.

20:00.310 --> 20:01.430
Here it is.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.160
<i>- Hello?
- Are you coming, Mr. Lee?</i>

20:24.160 --> 20:26.230
Yes, I just got off the bus.
I'll be right there.

20:26.230 --> 20:29.960
<i>- Your turn is coming up very soon.
- I'm sorry. I'm almost there.</i>

20:31.710 --> 20:32.830
Shit.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.210
Excuse me,
I'll have another lottery ticket.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.720
I'm sorry, sir.
But we're all out.

20:49.820 --> 20:54.780
What? But there was
some here a while ago...

21:08.310 --> 21:11.040
Excuse me,
do you have a religion by the way?

21:11.340 --> 21:13.240
No, I don't.

21:13.610 --> 21:16.510
Then... throw these away
for me, please.

21:23.790 --> 21:25.450
- Hello there, sonny.
- Oh, hi.

21:25.630 --> 21:27.650
- Lee Hyeon-su?
- Yes, yes.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.230
I'm here to give you
some good words.

21:29.230 --> 21:32.630
I'm sorry but if you're not going to
buy anything, I need to leave now...

21:32.730 --> 21:35.130
- Do you believe in Jesus?
- I do! I believe in Jesus.

21:35.700 --> 21:40.230
Must be another Jesus.
Believe in our Jesus and go to heaven, sonny.

21:40.570 --> 21:43.510
- Let me pray for you.
- Excuse me...

21:44.340 --> 21:48.180
Our Lord and Savior,
we pray for Lee Hyeon-su.

21:48.550 --> 21:56.250
Hyeon-su's working very, very hard
in this store even on a hot day.

21:56.390 --> 21:59.650
Pour down your grace
upon Hyeon-su, our Lord and Savior...

22:13.140 --> 22:14.130
One, please.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.670
'The One' cigarette?
Which one?

22:17.380 --> 22:19.470
- One.
- You mean 1 mm?

22:19.610 --> 22:21.380
- Esse.
- Esse cigarette?

22:21.380 --> 22:22.750
Which one do you want?

22:23.020 --> 22:25.180
ONE, ESSE.

22:26.850 --> 22:30.150
Either existence or one.
It's a difficult question.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.380
Excuse me?

22:31.490 --> 22:33.790
Do you know the Latin root for Esse?

22:34.260 --> 22:36.400
Sir, if you're not going to buy anything,
I need to get going.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.670
To exist.
Esse One comes to exist as a being.

22:39.670 --> 22:43.030
And by existence here,
it refers to the fundamental One.

22:43.370 --> 22:44.640
So would you like The One?

22:44.640 --> 22:47.410
The ancient philosopher Parmenides said,
"Existence is One.

22:47.410 --> 22:49.710
What exists, exists;
what doesn't, doesn't."

22:49.710 --> 22:54.200
Because thinking exists,
and nothingness does not.

22:54.310 --> 22:57.910
If a burger rots,
is it not a burger anymore?

22:58.050 --> 23:01.190
Does it rot because it's a burger?
Or is it a burger because it rots?

23:01.190 --> 23:05.490
The world of senses is in this producing,
changing world we exist.

23:05.490 --> 23:09.150
In other words, the existence, the essence,
the nature of a burger... Idea is one.

23:09.260 --> 23:12.660
If the existence is all one,
what are humans trying to become one with?

23:12.770 --> 23:14.870
It's the One, the Absolute.

23:14.870 --> 23:17.370
People's desires to identify themselves
with the One can be found everywhere.

23:17.370 --> 23:20.240
Because people think manifestation of
existence relies on the religion.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.370
But... is salvation possible?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.380
Sir, what is it that you want?

23:24.380 --> 23:27.640
To want? What?
What do I exist for?

23:27.910 --> 23:28.980
Raison d'etre?

23:28.980 --> 23:30.580
Raison!
You want 'Raison,' the cigarette?

23:30.580 --> 23:33.090
There's something called the principle
of sufficient reason.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.720
Everything exists for a reason.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.990
You, me, and all of us exist for a reason.
So please.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.320
Don't ever be sorry that
you were born.

23:41.430 --> 23:44.920
We all have the reason for existence
But the problem is our reason.

23:45.030 --> 23:49.330
Because of our reason
we put ourselves in agony.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.170
It's because we separated a priori
from the experience of the body

23:51.170 --> 23:53.440
and thus came to think
we internally have the pure rational concept

23:53.440 --> 23:55.280
as a universal form of experience.
Ergo raison d'etre.

23:55.280 --> 23:58.370
So do you want blue or black?

23:58.480 --> 24:03.050
Neoplatonist Plotinus believed that
there's another world beyond the reason

24:03.050 --> 24:06.090
and that we can return to the absolute,
or become One through that world.

24:06.090 --> 24:09.460
But reason must admit infinity,
so truth is in essential, abominable.

24:09.460 --> 24:12.860
Look.
In the end, the truth id ugly.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.420
"Art exists for humans to not perish
by reason."

24:17.000 --> 24:19.330
That's what Nietzsche said.
Nietzsche.

24:20.170 --> 24:23.190
If Nietzsche came by to buy cigarettes,
he would've said,

24:28.240 --> 24:29.670
One Marlboro, please.

24:30.780 --> 24:32.470
Red or light?

24:32.850 --> 24:35.110
Do you know the Latin root
of the word 'red'?

24:37.750 --> 24:40.120
- It's 2,700 won?
- Yes, it is.

24:40.450 --> 24:45.190
Wait, I've too many coins here...

24:45.730 --> 24:48.350
If you ain't got no money,
then fuck off!

24:49.430 --> 24:52.230
Don't ever be sorry you were born.
It was a pleasure.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.150
Hello?
I'm coming up right now!

25:10.150 --> 25:12.080
<i>No, you don't have to.</i>

25:12.520 --> 25:16.790
You're kidding me.
Please, I prepped so much for this.

25:16.790 --> 25:18.220
So just give me one more shot.

25:18.590 --> 25:20.890
<i>We've given you
as much as we can.</i>

25:20.890 --> 25:22.990
<i>I'm afraid you're not fit for us.</i>

25:24.800 --> 25:25.960
Right...

25:26.230 --> 25:28.900
<i>Don't you think that being on time
is pretty basic?</i>

25:28.900 --> 25:32.070
I'm very sorry.
I guess I'll try out next time...

25:32.070 --> 25:34.130
<i>We've already given you a chance.</i>

25:34.840 --> 25:38.480
<i>You must've prepared a lot, but I'm afraid
I can't do anything for you at this point.</i>

25:38.480 --> 25:40.570
<i>Don't let this disappoint you.
There are a lot of...</i>

26:18.850 --> 26:22.250
Hey.
You got Vita 1000?

26:22.660 --> 26:25.220
(In North Korean accent)
We only have Kwangdong 500.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.850
Shit.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.390
Heard Kwangdong's CEO
Choi Soo-boo croaked.

26:32.100 --> 26:35.660
Money don't give shit
when you croak!

26:36.440 --> 26:39.410
Steve Jobs fucking croaked
from pancreatic cancer.

26:41.870 --> 26:44.500
And Samsung's CEO
Lee Kun-hee's a skinny ass...

26:51.480 --> 26:52.680
Go ahead.

26:57.890 --> 27:02.520
(with a North Korean accent)
Eh... you drink this too over there?

27:02.630 --> 27:04.290
That'll be 1,650 won.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.040
You can keep the change.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.870
What's your name and number?

27:15.940 --> 27:17.530
You need to pay 10 more won.

27:19.810 --> 27:20.970
Is that so?

27:21.980 --> 27:23.740
Then put it on my tab!

27:23.850 --> 27:26.050
Or tell that guy Kim Jeong-eun
to pay it back.

27:26.290 --> 27:27.750
Fucking commies...

27:39.970 --> 27:41.020
Go ahead.

27:45.170 --> 27:46.760
It'll be 5,010 won.

27:47.470 --> 27:48.870
You know what this is?

27:49.910 --> 27:51.040
You don't?

27:51.380 --> 27:51.980
<i>(Banana-flavored condom)</i>

27:51.980 --> 27:53.750
<i>(Banana-flavored condom)
Want this big daddy to teach you
how to use this thing?</i>

27:53.750 --> 27:56.480
Want this big daddy to teach you
how to use this thing?

27:57.450 --> 27:59.750
Are you harassing me
right now?

27:59.850 --> 28:02.150
Oh, you even know
what 'harassing' means?

28:02.490 --> 28:04.220
You're getting it all wrong.

28:04.220 --> 28:09.220
I'm just worried.
Abortion's illegal here, first of all.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.120
If you don't want to use it
with me,

28:13.370 --> 28:16.820
then... you can use it
with your boyfriend.

28:17.170 --> 28:19.200
So how many times you think
you can do it?

28:19.510 --> 28:22.100
Big daddy here's hella good.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.510
I'm good, for real.
Real fucking good!

28:25.850 --> 28:30.210
What do you think,
want to have a go with this banana flavor?

28:32.490 --> 28:36.790
If you're not doing it,
then why ask?

28:36.890 --> 28:38.460
You all talk big!

28:38.460 --> 28:39.820
It's none of my business.

28:40.390 --> 28:43.850
Oh, fine.
It's none of my business either!

28:45.000 --> 28:46.190
Shit.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.120
Oh no, what do we do!

29:21.170 --> 29:24.360
There's no time
for you to sit around like this!

29:27.840 --> 29:30.680
This is big!
Man, I really wasn't gonna come...

29:30.680 --> 29:31.680
what is it?

29:31.680 --> 29:38.080
It's a war! Your country's
firing a nuclear missile.

29:38.220 --> 29:40.950
Those fucking commies,
gone insane from not fighting!

29:40.950 --> 29:43.890
They're all coming down here
and it's gonna be war!

29:43.890 --> 29:46.150
No time to sit around here...

29:49.630 --> 29:53.120
By the way... what are you doing
in front of a customer?

29:53.500 --> 29:54.860
You're not gonna welcome me?

29:56.470 --> 29:57.940
Welcome!

30:02.410 --> 30:06.710
Your country, what's wrong
with those commies? Huh?

30:06.710 --> 30:09.120
Peaceful reunification?
What peaceful reunification!

30:09.120 --> 30:10.650
It's all the commies' fantasy.

30:10.650 --> 30:14.680
If those commies come down here
we'll be wiped out completely!

30:14.820 --> 30:18.860
Only innocent people like me
get killed for no reason!

30:18.860 --> 30:22.530
And women first,
they'll get raped on the streets, you know.

30:22.530 --> 30:25.060
Without condoms, never.

30:25.060 --> 30:27.190
Kids, what about kids?!

30:31.400 --> 30:35.970
- One Lamborghini, please.
- Oh. Right.

30:36.940 --> 30:38.030
Look.

30:40.580 --> 30:42.240
I was here first.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.880
Where's the restroom?

30:47.850 --> 30:50.080
It's right inside the door.

30:50.190 --> 30:52.920
OK, I'll pay a moment later.

30:57.630 --> 31:00.430
Is she fucking drugged up or something?
What's wrong with her?

31:00.430 --> 31:05.100
Cutting in front of me and shit!
You get many customers like that?

31:05.100 --> 31:06.590
Anyways,

31:07.940 --> 31:11.680
which side will you take
if we get in a war?

31:11.680 --> 31:13.480
What if I said North Korea?

31:13.480 --> 31:14.880
Look at you, look at you.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.680
This is why... Once a commie,
always a commie!

31:18.680 --> 31:19.890
My father used to say,

31:19.890 --> 31:23.060
why we have to feed you commies
with our tax money?

31:23.060 --> 31:26.510
I'm a South Korean
who pay taxes like everyone else here.

31:26.630 --> 31:30.800
You lucky you.
If the North wins you'll be a commie,

31:30.800 --> 31:34.290
if the South wins you'll fucking sit there
and paint your nail polish.

31:36.470 --> 31:39.030
- What you think?
- I'm not thinking.

31:39.170 --> 31:42.330
No... about me.

31:43.180 --> 31:46.240
What you think about me?

31:49.010 --> 31:50.980
Sounds silly?

32:00.790 --> 32:02.490
Are you laughing at me or what?

32:11.440 --> 32:12.930
You got money?

32:14.910 --> 32:17.140
Why the money talk right now?

32:17.140 --> 32:21.980
If you don't, fuck off.
That's the rule I learned here.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.280
Don't mess around with me
if you're not buying anything.

32:25.750 --> 32:29.150
Greedy pig.
Is money that important to you?

32:29.260 --> 32:33.250
You think I don't know this place?
Money rules here.

32:33.590 --> 32:37.460
Why'd I work for you
if you don't have any money?

32:38.130 --> 32:41.100
Fucking weirdo...

32:45.370 --> 32:50.140
Look. I do have money.
Here, I'm getting a pack of gum.

32:50.210 --> 32:52.510
OK?
Now I'm a customer, yeah?

32:54.980 --> 32:56.410
The pack of gum's 700 won,

32:56.620 --> 33:00.680
so that'd be a total of 37,710 won,
including the tab. Sir.

33:02.590 --> 33:08.060
37, 7... I'll get you that.
I do have it at home.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.300
Just wait, I'll be back.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.020
You can't just leave.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.630
I'm not,
my credit card's on hold.

33:14.630 --> 33:16.370
I said I'll come back
and get you the money.

33:16.370 --> 33:19.930
There's no tab
for people with bad credit.

33:31.580 --> 33:35.950
You shithead.
So what if I have bad credit?

33:36.060 --> 33:38.580
What have you done for me?

33:40.830 --> 33:44.280
Cunt doesn't know shit
and keeps yacking away!

33:44.360 --> 33:47.600
You're the one stealing without paying,
so don't get pissed at me!

33:47.600 --> 33:49.970
You fucking pro-North Korean
commie bitch.

33:50.340 --> 33:53.170
I'm... not a North Korean anymore.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.610
Fuck you.

33:54.610 --> 33:59.010
<i>All you dirty whores got sold to China
when you came down during the war.</i>

33:59.010 --> 34:00.310
<i>Dirty, fucking cunt!</i>

34:00.310 --> 34:06.310
You... you filthy South Korean beggar,
think you can say anything to me?

34:10.090 --> 34:13.350
I called the cops, so get out.
Get out!

34:14.530 --> 34:16.219
You don't understand...

34:16.330 --> 34:17.590
Get out!

34:24.139 --> 34:25.159
I'm sorry.

34:25.469 --> 34:27.270
<i>Crazy bastard...</i>

34:30.540 --> 34:31.739
Get out!

35:23.100 --> 35:24.190
Yo!

35:24.760 --> 35:27.160
<i>Ya kno what time it eez, huh?</i>

35:29.640 --> 35:30.660
Check it out!

35:31.340 --> 35:34.930
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Baby!

36:42.810 --> 36:44.940
Have we met before?

36:45.140 --> 36:48.270
What?
No, I don't think so.

36:48.480 --> 36:52.180
I think so.
Try to remember.

36:53.590 --> 36:55.080
Where have we met?

36:56.460 --> 36:57.820
At your home.

37:01.090 --> 37:02.420
Don't you remember?

37:04.460 --> 37:06.830
I actually have a bad memory...

37:12.200 --> 37:16.370
Actually, I'm still there.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.410
Where's there?

37:20.380 --> 37:21.640
Your place.

37:22.110 --> 37:25.570
Oh, man!
God, you scared me!

37:27.350 --> 37:29.720
Thought it was that
time I got hung over.

37:30.890 --> 37:32.650
Please keep this here.

37:34.930 --> 37:37.160
Sorry, but we don't keep things here.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.390
Someone's going to pick it up soon...

37:41.330 --> 37:43.630
It's really important.

37:44.140 --> 37:47.570
Don't give it to just anybody.

37:48.940 --> 37:52.000
Make sure you give it to someone
who doesn't buy anything here.

37:55.650 --> 37:57.080
Promise me?

38:04.920 --> 38:08.260
What, that's the bathroom key.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.510
<i>Have we met before?</i>

38:37.660 --> 38:41.060
<i>Try to remember.</i>

38:45.730 --> 38:46.630
Welcome.

38:52.570 --> 38:54.330
Did someone leave anything here?

38:54.670 --> 39:01.010
<i>Make sure to give it to someone
who doesn't buy anything.</i>

39:02.550 --> 39:04.740
- Are you...
- Yes.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.550
<i>Make sure you give it to someone
who doesn't buy anything here.</i>

39:16.030 --> 39:18.290
Do you know what it is?

39:18.660 --> 39:21.360
Well, it's nothing important.

39:21.470 --> 39:24.490
I'm sorry,
there's nothing like that here.

39:30.340 --> 39:35.780
Oh, these are all delivered boxes.
Nobody left anything.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.320
There's nothing for you here!

39:44.690 --> 39:47.560
Alright.
I guess I was mistaken.

39:50.530 --> 39:52.360
Have you seen this girl?

39:52.900 --> 39:55.830
Is she a North Korean spy?
I don't know.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.470
<i>She's a dangerous woman,
so if you see her call 010- 487...</i>

39:58.470 --> 40:01.230
You dumbshit, are you here
to advertise our number?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.730
Call 911.

40:13.050 --> 40:16.150
Shit, that son of a bitch cop.

40:19.360 --> 40:22.020
Fussing about spies of all things...

40:41.950 --> 40:42.970
welcome.

41:17.550 --> 41:20.180
<i>Make sure you give it to someone
who doesn't buy anything here.</i>

41:24.990 --> 41:26.510
Fucking box!

41:37.240 --> 41:38.630
You're back...

42:25.150 --> 42:28.120
Man... Could you please eat
after you pay.

42:39.730 --> 42:42.560
Never gonna end up like her,
not me...

42:53.080 --> 42:54.010
Ma'am!

42:54.010 --> 42:56.980
How'd you get in here?
Please go out.

42:57.820 --> 43:03.650
Do you have any
recyclable things I can take?

43:03.990 --> 43:06.560
The old man came yesterday
and took it all.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.750
Really...

43:09.760 --> 43:11.890
wait!

43:15.170 --> 43:18.360
Ma'am, please take this.

43:18.770 --> 43:21.930
Why this all of a sudden?
Is nothing in here?

43:22.040 --> 43:23.200
I'm clueless.

43:23.640 --> 43:26.950
<i>It's pretty heavy though.
I think it's too much for me.</i>

43:26.950 --> 43:33.080
I've been taking empty boxes only.
It's too much for me.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.590
OK, bye.

43:53.940 --> 43:56.270
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

43:56.780 --> 43:58.000
Who?

43:58.710 --> 44:00.510
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

44:02.650 --> 44:05.510
<i>- Who is this?
- It's me!</i>

44:07.420 --> 44:12.320
What the...
what happened?

44:12.390 --> 44:16.380
<i>It's a shame
you remembered so late.</i>

44:16.500 --> 44:21.630
No, no.
I've been thinking about you.

44:24.070 --> 44:32.770
You're going to pick up
this box, right?

44:33.650 --> 44:35.440
<i>Actually...</i>

44:36.180 --> 44:38.170
<i>I'm still there.</i>

44:39.550 --> 44:41.710
Where's there?

44:42.190 --> 44:44.180
<i>Right next to you!</i>

44:44.560 --> 44:49.790
Ha ha, what on earth
are you talking about.

44:49.900 --> 44:52.990
<i>Here, here.</i>

44:58.140 --> 44:59.000
Hello?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.910
<i>Yes, did you find it?</i>

45:13.750 --> 45:15.220
<i>This isn't a dream.</i>

45:22.030 --> 45:24.190
<i>Don't touch me,
you fucking perv.</i>

45:24.960 --> 45:29.760
What?
You fucker, who are you?

45:30.170 --> 45:32.100
<i>Now you're curious?</i>

45:32.100 --> 45:36.200
You! Come out first,
you fucking psycho!

45:36.680 --> 45:40.410
<i>You know... you're an asshole,
and you have a big mouth.</i>

45:40.910 --> 45:42.400
<i>Let's shut it up.</i>

45:42.550 --> 45:45.540
What the hell do you know...

45:52.990 --> 45:54.360
<i>Silence, at last.</i>

45:55.590 --> 45:56.960
<i>Really nice.</i>

45:57.360 --> 45:59.020
<i>Let's stay like this for
just one minute.</i>

46:05.800 --> 46:07.330
<i>It's no use.</i>

46:07.570 --> 46:10.100
<i>Anyway, you'll have to
go into the box.</i>

46:15.610 --> 46:19.570
My voice is back, you bitch!
You're fucking dead!

46:34.900 --> 46:36.030
<i>Goodbye!</i>

46:48.410 --> 46:50.640
What? What is this?
What the hell!

46:50.920 --> 46:52.250
Why's it so dark?

46:53.320 --> 46:55.980
Hey!
Stop playing with me.

46:56.990 --> 47:00.050
Let me out.
Let me out...

47:00.360 --> 47:03.490
what?!
Where are you going!

47:15.910 --> 47:17.670
Is no one there?

47:19.210 --> 47:21.370
What the...

47:27.520 --> 47:28.680
Is it locked?

47:35.130 --> 47:36.290
It's locked?

47:47.840 --> 47:49.930
- Is it locked?
- It's locked.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.040
- Is it still locked?
- Yes, it's still locked.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.550
<i>Jeez, I'm starving...</i>

48:26.810 --> 48:28.140
Hey, where are you?

48:28.510 --> 48:30.910
The store's closed.

48:31.750 --> 48:33.310
OK, I'll be right there.

48:33.790 --> 48:36.650
Where the hell is he?

48:38.520 --> 48:41.010
Why the hell isn't he coming?

48:41.330 --> 48:42.990
Maybe he went to the restroom?

48:54.110 --> 48:57.400
- Is it locked?
- It's locked.

49:09.020 --> 49:11.420
Are you the mother of
Mr. Chun Doo-hwan who owns this store?

49:11.660 --> 49:16.420
I'm in front of the store right now.
Aren't you open today?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.990
I can't get in touch with him.

49:19.230 --> 49:22.130
I'm off work soon,
so please come quickly.

49:23.170 --> 49:25.570
I'll tell you when you get here,
so please hurry.

50:27.070 --> 50:28.930
Hey, hey.

50:29.300 --> 50:31.290
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Mr. Chun.

50:31.600 --> 50:35.200
- Are you working or what?
- I'm working right now.

50:35.870 --> 50:39.740
You call this working right now?

50:39.880 --> 50:43.210
And why are you
playing this so loud?

50:44.320 --> 50:47.380
If I have my earphones on,
I can't hear the customers coming in.

50:48.420 --> 50:52.010
So you heard me come in
just right now?

50:54.860 --> 50:58.850
If you're here, don't pull this
kind of thing. Just work!

50:58.960 --> 51:01.330
This isn't a prep school.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.200
Shut that off right now!

51:12.740 --> 51:20.020
In Japan, you put your cellphone and
books in the locker and only work.

51:20.020 --> 51:21.140
Understand?

51:21.490 --> 51:24.480
Even part-timers are
professional over there.

51:25.290 --> 51:28.350
- Have you been to Japan?
- No.

51:28.460 --> 51:33.090
Look at you, look at you.
That's why you can't get a job.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.390
Yes, sir.

51:38.070 --> 51:44.840
Please think of this as your job
and be a little more proactive!

51:45.080 --> 51:46.070
Yes, sir.

51:47.150 --> 51:49.080
What's wrong with you.

52:13.970 --> 52:17.310
Look how lucky you are.

52:17.510 --> 52:21.380
You get paid every penny
just killing time here.

52:25.150 --> 52:27.620
I'm jealous of you,
really jealous.

52:29.490 --> 52:30.850
Don't laugh, buster!

52:32.820 --> 52:36.930
You, open this box,
clean up the store...

52:36.930 --> 52:38.530
...those boxes over there too.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.190
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

52:40.470 --> 52:43.630
- And put that away. I mean it.
- Yes, sir.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.780
Welcome.

54:15.190 --> 54:17.160
May, I, help you?

54:24.470 --> 54:25.990
I hear, that...

54:27.110 --> 54:32.010
In Afghanistan,
just becoming a mother is,

54:32.080 --> 54:35.510
most dangerous things,
for a woman.

54:39.120 --> 54:43.180
In Afghanistan,
just becoming a mother is,

54:43.250 --> 54:44.420
most dangerous things...

54:44.420 --> 54:46.420
Don't talk to me.
Don't annoy me.

54:46.420 --> 54:49.480
This is fucking racist. OK?
Fucking racist!

54:49.790 --> 54:50.780
Fucking?

54:59.170 --> 55:01.260
We're not from Afghanistan.

55:01.340 --> 55:04.600
Oh my god, your nose...

55:05.310 --> 55:06.540
Are you okay?

55:13.320 --> 55:14.680
Do I look the same?

55:20.390 --> 55:24.190
Yes... You are so beautiful.

55:24.300 --> 55:25.260
Thanks.

55:25.700 --> 55:27.690
How much?
Will you hurry up?

55:30.500 --> 55:32.800
Hurry up!
How much?

55:33.140 --> 55:34.000
OK, wait...

55:34.310 --> 55:37.470
Um... 8 thousand,
and 3 hundred won.

55:57.130 --> 56:00.150
It's too bad.
I didn't got to play a flume ride.

56:00.300 --> 56:03.200
Oh, honey. You don't wanna wait
that long line, do you?

56:03.200 --> 56:05.030
Yes, I know.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.340
Welcome.

56:06.340 --> 56:07.930
Where are the drinks?

56:12.340 --> 56:14.980
- Mommy, Guess what?
- Yes, honey. What is it?

56:14.980 --> 56:16.950
I've got a mail from Jessica.

56:17.150 --> 56:18.670
She's in Paris right now!

56:19.080 --> 56:21.310
She even went to Louvre yesterday.

56:21.520 --> 56:22.120
Louvre...

56:22.120 --> 56:24.350
where are we going
for our vacation?

56:24.760 --> 56:26.450
Well, wherever you wanna go?

56:26.520 --> 56:28.010
Louvre sounds good.

56:28.130 --> 56:29.890
Let me talk to your dad
about it, OK?

56:29.990 --> 56:32.300
Yeah. How about Africa?

56:32.300 --> 56:33.960
Africa is too dangerous.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.630
Mom, this is new!
Can I please try it?

56:37.740 --> 56:40.540
Oh, honey.
You know is not good for you.

56:40.540 --> 56:42.470
It's artificial Strawberry.

56:42.470 --> 56:46.380
I know.
But just this one time, please...

56:47.180 --> 56:49.440
All right. Just this once.

56:49.550 --> 56:50.840
Don't tell your dad.

56:55.920 --> 56:56.720
Hi.

56:59.390 --> 57:00.980
Where are you from?

57:05.330 --> 57:06.800
May I help you?

57:07.470 --> 57:08.690
I'll buy those.

57:10.270 --> 57:11.390
OK...

57:15.770 --> 57:17.470
That'll be 2,400 won.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.500
Here you go.

57:20.610 --> 57:22.740
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best!

57:22.880 --> 57:25.180
I know.
Anything for my sweety my baby.

57:25.680 --> 57:26.620
Let's go!

57:27.450 --> 57:28.850
Excuse me... your receipt!

57:30.790 --> 57:31.660
Welcome.

57:31.660 --> 57:33.790
Candy.
Did you see that spy wanted list?

57:33.790 --> 57:36.990
Yeah.
That girl with a scar on her face?

57:36.990 --> 57:40.190
- Yeah. But you know what's worse?
- What's that?

57:40.260 --> 57:44.130
When I first came to Korea, I went to
a convenience store to get some water.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.100
The part-timer there had
a big scar like that!

57:47.200 --> 57:50.010
What? So that spy woman
was working there?

57:50.010 --> 57:52.210
Dunno, but there aren't many people
with big scars like that, you know.

57:52.210 --> 57:54.140
True, I heard there's a lot of
North Korean spies here.

57:54.580 --> 57:56.340
- Huh?
- It's an interesting country.

57:56.450 --> 57:58.110
Strawberry's out?

57:58.250 --> 58:00.420
There's banana flavor!
How about banana flavor?

58:00.420 --> 58:03.220
- I don't like banana flavor.
- I heard it tastes good...

58:03.220 --> 58:06.020
- who did you use the banana flavor with?
- Candy, what's wrong with you?

58:06.020 --> 58:07.960
Spill it, who did you use it with?
Don't you lie to me!

58:07.960 --> 58:10.260
What's wrong with you, Candy...

58:10.730 --> 58:11.560
Candy.

58:11.660 --> 58:13.290
Never mind!
Go ahead and ask.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.460
Excuse me,
is there strawberry flavor?

58:16.670 --> 58:18.870
- Strawberry flavor?
- Yes. Strawberry flavor.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.340
- Calm down, Candy...
- Don't touch me!

58:20.340 --> 58:22.830
Of course!
Please wait, wait.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.250
Hey. Tell me now.
Who did you use it with!

58:28.250 --> 58:29.640
Candy, let's stop this...

58:31.380 --> 58:34.110
Foreigner like to strawberry candy.

58:34.250 --> 58:37.760
What the hell is this?
That's not it! You fucking retards!!

58:37.760 --> 58:39.590
Candy, calm down...

58:44.230 --> 58:45.820
Strawberry candy...

59:32.210 --> 59:33.540
welcome to our store.

59:33.880 --> 59:36.510
Um, I'm not a customer.
I came to find some part-time work.

59:37.010 --> 59:39.480
<i>You look pretty young.
Aren't you in high school?</i>

59:39.680 --> 59:40.710
No.

59:41.220 --> 59:43.880
- How old are you?
- I'm eight-fuckin-teen.

59:44.260 --> 59:47.750
- Say what?
- Oops! I'm eighteen.

59:48.790 --> 59:50.020
Show me your ID.

59:52.860 --> 59:54.190
Here it is, sir.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.090
Welcome.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:02.640
You're a student, alright.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:03.970
Nope, I'm not.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.310
- You don't go to school?
- Nope.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.840
How come you
don't go to school?

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:12.870
And what was that about
eight-fuckin-teen, to a grownup.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.110
Eighteen!
That's how you say it properly.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.650
Didn't you learn that in school?

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.540
I dropped out.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.690
Sir, this is 'buy two, get one free'.
You can get another bottle.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.090
Oh, that so?

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.050
- What do you do if you're not in school?
- I write.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.820
You write?

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:36.370
Hey. I'm telling you, kid.
School won't wait for you forever.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:38.510
You should be studying
in school at your age!

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.980
You can't earn money
from writing!

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.440
Yes, I can.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.110
Hey.
You know nothing about life right now.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.620
And if you're looking for work,
you should be polite, not grinning like that.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.680
Would you hire yourself
if you were in my position?

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:56.890
Stop laughing, kid!
Front of a grown-up like me...

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.860
You're not fit for us.
Go somewhere else.

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:05.000
- Fucking bastard.
- That little...

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.400
That rude son of a bitch.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.170
That'll be 2,400 won.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.180
- Please, take this.
- Thank you so much, sir!

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.480
You're so hard-working.

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.490
And you don't even hire
part-time workers...

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.330
Can't trust kids these days,
you know?

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.920
Irresponsible and greedy...

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.530
How's the business going?

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.130
It's alright.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.860
The economy's really bad
these days, you know.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.230
I don't get any customers
at all either.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.690
You own the sashimi place, right?

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.180
Yes. Please come to
my place more often.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.310
I'll give you a good service.

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.670
Yes.
Thank you very much.

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.040
- Have a good day.
- Same for you.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:50.670
Hey.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.410
We'll get through the hard times.
Cheers!

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.840
Cheers!

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.980
Shit... this is way too heavy...

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:40.160
- This one is not for sale?
- No.

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.330
Any trouble while I was away?

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.000
Not at all! I've been here all along,
so how can anything happen?

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.020
What the... it doesn't match.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.830
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:19.500
- Did you check the inventory for today?
- Yes, I did.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:21.530
It doesn't match up, though.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.220
It's not matching up.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.080
What's going on here?

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.860
What's this?

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:51.260
Chips past their expiration date
can be discarded, right?

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.280
No, snacks shouldn't be discarded.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.040
Think how long this thing's
expiration date is.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.780
Oh... I ate one
because I thought otherwise...

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.180
- I'll pay for that.
- No, no, that's alright.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:14.020
Just don't do it next time.

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:18.830
And you know, the inventory's
not matching up these days.

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:21.060
So please check a bit more carefully.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.270
This stuff is all money.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:25.570
If it doesn't match up,
I have to pay the head branch myself.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.870
Yes, sir.
I understand.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.660
Hey, mom.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.560
<i>Mija's mom asked me
when you can pay her back...</i>

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.130
I asked you to wait a bit.

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:57.200
<i>That's what I'm telling her,
but that woman's keep...</i>

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.870
Mom, mom, mom.
Hang on, hang on.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.770
<i>I'll get my hands on
money pretty soon.</i>

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:04.040
<i>Is your business going better?</i>

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:06.140
How can it?

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.510
After the electricity bills, the rent,
and paying these kids...

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.410
I get nothing for myself.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:14.040
And the money I send to
the head branch everyday...

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.590
those bastards.

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:18.420
<i>Then how are going to
get the money?</i>

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.130
I've something in mind.
Don't worry, just get some rest.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:24.190
<i>Don't use part-time workers.
I can help you out.</i>

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.960
Mom, how can you work here.
At your age.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.500
Customers don't like old people
working here anyways.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:35.770
<i>Alright...</i>

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:38.070
Mom, please get some rest.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.660
Oh, Lord...

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.540
Sir!
What are you doing here?

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.180
- You're back!
- I wanted to see you again.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.020
Actually... I came to get more of those
honey water bottles for my workers.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.210
Sure.
Please bring them here.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.770
So if I get these
four it'd be 4,800 won, right?

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:39.900
Two for free.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.800
Yes.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.460
Wait, hold on.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:53.470
Has this been being selling as
'buy two, get one free'?

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:56.340
Yes.
Is there any problem?

01:06:56.950 --> 01:07:00.360
Didn't you check the date here?
It says until July.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:05.590
If so, then why... the computer said
it was still on sale.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.970
How many times did I tell you,

01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:12.330
the head branch workers make mistakes
so you need to be more careful!

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.100
We're sorry.
That'll be 7,200 won.

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:27.140
Wait, he told me it was 'buy two, get one free'
just a while ago... and I got one free.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.920
- You did?
- Yes.

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:34.180
No... Sir, I apologize.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:39.750
But it's no longer on sale.
So you have to pay 7,200 won.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.330
That's none of my business.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:46.800
If the sale policy's changed without an
announcement to customers,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.040
it should be sold the way
customers know it.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.610
It's not like you've
opened business recently.

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:53.840
I run business too.
This isn't how you should work.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:03.150
OK. I apologize, sir.
Just give it to him.

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.480
'Buy two, get one... '

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.860
Sir, please take these...

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.730
I'm not buying anymore!
Go drink these up yourself!

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.200
Are you kidding with me?

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.130
For a couple bucks.
Jesus.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:46.090
Dammit. Shit...

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.979
You think chips can be discarded?
You think?!

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:27.190
<i>Interview results.
Please press your interview ID.</i>

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.540

<i>If you'd like to return...</i>

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.260
That'll be 3,650 won.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.200
How much is this?

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.610
This one's 800 won.

01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:19.070
It's on a 'buy one, get one free' sale,
so you can go get one more.

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.170
What about this and this?

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:25.090
This is 850 won,
and this is 1,000 won.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:29.460
I'll just get these.
So much more expensive than mine.

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:33.960
They're from yesterday, too...
I'll get this too.

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:38.930
That'll be 1,600 won.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.280
<i>No worries,
everybody say, TEA CHA CHA</i>

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:00.250
Si-hu!
You've eaten yet?

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.350
I'm about to eat now.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:10.520
A lot of yummy rice
and side-dishes today.

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:16.030
I'm feeling really good today.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:17.810
Alright.

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:23.100
I love you, son.

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:31.480
Ouch!
Hot, hot!

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.660
Yikes!
So hot.

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.270
<i>How may I help you?</i>

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.500
Nonghyup Bank.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.170
<i>That's a difficult question to answer.</i>

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:52.500
Nong-hyup-ban-k.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.400
<i>That's a difficult question.</i>

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:58.220

Convenience stores don't

There's no day off
at convenience stores.

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:31.880
Well, props to you for being
here instead of hanging out

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.850
with your boyfriend and friends
on such a nice weather like this.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.760
I'm not a kid anymore, you know.
I need to make my ends meet.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.520
You're such
a hardworking young lady.

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:49.300
May fortune smile on you.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:52.560
It's for me?

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.740
Oh gosh,
what did I just do!

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.770
I was supposed to give you
this first, not that.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.070
I'm losing my mind.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.950
That'll be 1,400 won.

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:09.010
- Did I surprise you?
- No, it's alright.

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:15.820
Here's your change.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.900
- You have toilet paper here?
- It's up there.

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:25.500
- Over there?
- Yes.

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.260
How much is it?

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.440
That'll be 15,600 won.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:39.480
Why's it so expensive? It's so much
more expensive than where I live.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.280
What are you doing?

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.390
- Are you going to buy it?
- I guess I've no choice.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.350
20,000 won received.
Would you like the receipt?

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.830
- Hurry up.
- Here's 4,400 won, your change.

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:05.040
- Where's my receipt?
- You just said you didn't need it.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.600
When?

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.180
Do I have to tell you these things?
That's such a basic thing!

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:13.210
And by the way,
what's with the attitude?

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.190
- Then I'll get it for you.
- No, you're not doing me a favor.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:20.050
It's my right.

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.590
- What's your number?
- 011-9939-0348

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.520
It's all done.

01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:28.890
- Where's the restroom here?
- We don't have one.

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.100
Why not?

01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:32.490
There's no restrooms
in convenient stores, usually.

01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:36.970
That makes no sense.
There must be a restroom that you use.

01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.980
If you don't want to tell me,
then say it.

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.980
Don't lie to me when it's obvious.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.880
Do you shit here then?
Right here?

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.010
Then try shitting here!
Go ahead!

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.020
Outsiders are not allowed in our restroom.
Don't talk to me like that.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.490
Let's get this straight,
I'm a customer here.

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:56.190
What's with the service here?
I really got to go.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.830
Hey, lady!
There's really no restroom here?

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:01.360
I'm not sure.

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:05.990
Whatever, fine!
I'm returning this.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.200
I was getting this
because of the restroom.

01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.370
- OK, ma'am.
- This is killing me.

01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:20.180
- What's wrong with this?
- It's killing me...

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.650
I'm sorry.
Hold on, please.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:25.020
You're doing this on purpose
right now?

01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:26.950
Hurry up, please.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.660
I'll be back in a minute,
so have the refund ready.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.400
Welcome.

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:45.200
<i>Work's pretty tough, isn't it?
You seem pretty frustrated.</i>

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.070
No.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.430
This is empty.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.870
There weren't any gimbap on the rack either.
You guys aren't selling it?

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.980
The stock isn't in yet.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.280
So the owner
didn't order them yet?

01:16:57.390 --> 01:17:01.220
He did, but he does it a bit late.
We're sorry.

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.560
The management here
seems a little iffy here.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.090
Do you need something?

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.000
Welcome.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:42.420
How've you been?

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.260
Thank you for coming.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.210
He wasn't a customer, right?

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:59.180
He is... sort of,
but not really.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.610
Then who was that?

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.650
He comes to drink that soju
he keeps here.

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:10.620
Wait... you let people
keep soju here?

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:15.900
It's just... he doesn't want to
finish it all at once, that's why...

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.590
You think this is funny?

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.730
I'm sorry.

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:23.710
Does the manager here know
that the beggar comes by?

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.470
The manager said it's fine.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.700
He did?

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.840
Wow... this really is something...

01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:42.460
Hello? Are you owner
of the Seori branch?

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:44.690
Yes, I'm from the head branch.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.300
It seems messy here.
The stock's not organized,

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.240
the part-time worker's
not nice to customers...

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.970
And strange bums
coming into the store...

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.680
I'm giving you a warning.

01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:05.850
I see that you've closed night shifts
a few times too without permission.

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:10.510
And there's even repeated reports of
not paying for workers.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:16.350
You know this might lead to
a cancellation of the contract, right?

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:18.890
We'll be watching.

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:32.070
If not for that scar...
I wonder what the customers will think.

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:37.870
Take care.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:50.090
Yes, Mr. Chun.

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:54.860
<i>Why is it that the head
branch just called me?</i>

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.470
<i>- No, it's...
- I heard enough.</i>

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:58.900
<i>Just close the shop and get out.</i>

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:03.570
<i>You think I hired you to mess around
at work and give you every penny?</i>

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.710
It's not like you've seen
the whole thing.

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:08.410
You've only listened to
one side of the story.

01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:12.680
<i>I just got a call from the head branch,
so isn't it pretty obvious?!</i>

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.620
<i>I can't work with kids like you,
so get out of there right now.</i>

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.520
Sounds good. It's not like
I'm going to work here forever.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.790
<i>You're fired, so close the store
and get the hell out!</i>

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.730
<i>- Mr. Chun.
- What?</i>

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.530
If you backstab someone who's worked
this hard then no one can work with you!

01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:30.190
<i>What is this crap!</i>

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:37.540
<i>1002-3472-0572365.
Nonghyup Bank. Kim Min-hee.</i>

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.070
Is something wrong?

01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:10.930
I just got fired.

01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:16.180
Oh no, on such a nice day...

01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:22.440
I'll just look for another job,
I guess.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.520
What about the store here?

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.310
He told me to shut it
and get the hell out.

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:33.890
What in the world...

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:40.230
Think it this way.
You've gotten rid of bad luck.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:45.970
Are you really giving this to me?

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.370
Of course!

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:12.930
Sorry I'm late.

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.140
The bus stopped on the way,

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:26.620
so I had to walk here
all the way from that hill.

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.950
Strange neighborhood, really.

01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:35.150
Sorry for keeping you
waiting so long...

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:36.990
It's okay.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.440
- What's that?
- I didn't tell you yesterday?

01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:08.250
You have to check this
every morning for the inventory.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.620
So much to learn...

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:17.270
It's better when
you don't know these things.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.740
- Hi.
- Welcome.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:33.540
Here you go.
Two, four, six, eight 800s, two 2000s.

01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:40.090
- You check first...
- OK.

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:44.950
...and sign off at the end.

01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.600
- Wait a minute, you're new here.
- Me?

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:58.130
- You look really cute, lady.
- Oh, her?

01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:01.930
<i>She's pretty too.
But you're a real cutie.</i>

01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:05.710
See you again, cutie pie.

01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:07.480
Bye.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.710
Lucky you're cute, Hana.

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:20.590
<i>No. I mean, you're incredibly pretty.
That guy's weird.</i>

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:25.600
I've no idea why all guys are like that.
Gosh, it's so cheesy...

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.960
Let me try.

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:35.100
So how was it?
Can I have Cigar No. 3?

01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:38.940
Really?
I'm almost home now.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.680
That'll be 3,500 won.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.810
Alright.

01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:48.790
- Let's do that.
- That's 5,000 won. You need a receipt?

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.020
No thanks.

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:54.890
1,500 won, your change.
Thank you for stopping by.

01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.460
OK. See you soon.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.490
Thank you.

01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:08.880
He was cute.
Was he talking to his girlfriend?

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:13.370
Eunyoung.
Are you with someone?

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.440
- Are you interested?
- Sorry?

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.090
That guy?
No way!

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.920
If not, that's fine.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.170
By the way...
Have you eaten anything yet?

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:57.120
I think you'd look good with bangs.
Do you want me to cut it for you?

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.630
Eunyoung, come here.

01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:12.700
Ta-da!

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.810
I applied to cosmetics
for college, you know.

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:17.900
I used to take care of
all of my friends' bangs.

01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:28.620
- Hey, isn't that rapper guy ass-kicking?
- You mean Jae-min? He's aight.

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:30.920
- Wait, how do you know his name?
- None of your business, girl.

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:34.360
What's so good about that fat-ass?
He's bursting with fat.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.270
- Don't be cussing at our guy like that, OK?
- 'Our guy'? He's mine!

01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:39.540
- He's mine!
- You've gotta be kiddin'.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.160
Shut up, you bitches.

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:43.070
I just remembered.
You girls hear about it?

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:46.140
Kim Yu-ri in Class B.
She's a lesbo.

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.740
- O.M.G.
- I think I wanna puke.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.710
For real?

01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:51.150
Completely 'holy shit'. ROFLMAO.
Is that girl crazy?

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:54.140
- That's what I'm saying.
- Fuckin' disgusting.

01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:57.820
What if she comes after me?
Oh, shit...

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.720
<i>Stop exaggerating,
you crazy bitch.</i>

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.710
<i>She's got eyes, too. You think
she'd be crazy to go all over you?</i>

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.620
Looking like an asshole.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:07.530
You fuckin' cunts...
Hey, let's go get some ciggies.

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:09.290
No, I'm gon' get some snack
for Soohyun.

01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:13.330
This Plus cigarettes, please.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.930
We don't sell cigarettes
to underaged people.

01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:20.200
I'm sorry?
I always come here to get them.

01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:21.970
We don't sell them.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.610
What the fuck.

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.850
Hey, didn't you say you had
to charge your phone?

01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:28.650
Can I charge my phone here?

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.660
- That'll be 3,500 won.
- Hey, Gollum.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.980
You got 1,000 won?

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:41.460
You money-raking bitch...
always borrowing 1,000 wons.

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.200
- Knew you'd do this again.
- I only got a 10,000 won bill.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.530
Give it to me.

01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:47.260
Come back in about half an hour.
That'll be 1,000 won.

01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:52.340
I look so good.
Lesbos would totally fall for me.

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.810
Jesus Christ.
Seriously, for real?

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:58.410
Hurry up, we're gon' be late for class.
You fuckin' lesbo faggots.

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:02.180
I've had enough.
What was that? 'what the fuck? '

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.710
Cussing around here
in broad daylight

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:08.550
and getting cigs
when you should be in school.

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:11.390
Should at least change your damn
school uniforms before coming here,

01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:14.160
- you fucking assholes.
- What'd we do?

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.100
- I'm sorry.
- We're on our way back to school.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.130
- She's right.
- We're going to be late!

01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:18.930
Let's go.

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:21.130
Watch your mouths
in front of grownups.

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:23.870
I've had enough, so get out.

01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:26.840
- We're sorry...
- what're you apologizing for?

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:44.890
Were you surprised?
I'm not usually like this.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.760
Gosh, it's scorching hot.

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.950
Hyunsoo, did you mean
what you said?

01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:13.590
What do you mean?

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.860
That you'll wait for me.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:24.900
I can bear 21 months.
It's nothing to me.

01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:29.930
You're not meeting with
someone else, are you?

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:42.350
- Motherfucker, get in there.
- Stay still. Sit, I have a knife.

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:48.020
- Hey, open this! Quickly!
- Head down! Head down, you fucker.

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.650
Head down! Fuck!

01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:55.390
Heads down.

01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:02.170
Go inside, you shithead.
You fucker. C'mon, let's take it!

01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:03.330
You fuckers.

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:11.710
What you looking at?
Stop staring!

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:17.450
- Hey! Hey, catch her!
- Catch that bitch! You fuckers, get in there.

01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:18.680
Go fuckin' get her!

01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:27.530
Hey, bitch! Look, won't you stay still?
I'll kill you, alright?!

01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:42.680
- You got it?
- Yeah, I did.

01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:57.090
I told you not to stare at me, didn't I?
Hey, hey! Stop staring... heads down.

01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:59.430
- What the fuck.
- Eunyoung! Eunyoung!

01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:01.160
- What the fuck! Catch her! Catch her!
- Eunyoung...

01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:04.830
Sit down, you bitch!
Shit, we're fucked.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.600
Completely fucked.

01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:12.470
- Shut it!
- Careful! Might get hurt!

01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:15.100
Stay still!

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:18.540
- Go back this way.
- Get in, you bitch!

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:29.180
Hey! I got everything!
Let's leave! Right now!

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.190
- Don't look at my face!
- Shit!

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:29.760
Mr. Chun Doo-hwan!

01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:35.400
I'm from the
Seoul Central District Court.

01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:57.720
It's me here...

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:59.350
Are you Mr. Chun's mother?

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:07.160
Yes, what's going on?
He's never left this place empty before.

01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:09.760
The lights are still on.

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:12.540
He's not in there?

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.130
Try opening the door.

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:17.840
<i>We can't do that
since it's Mr. Chun's property.</i>

01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:22.180
What's going on...

01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.450
Doo-hwan?

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:33.000
<i>Mt. Halla's soaring spirit
protecting our people</i>

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:33.930
Doo-hwan?

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:44.600
<i>Our long history passing
as the hibiscus blooms and falls off</i>

01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:53.210
<i>O, wise nation and people
We've come a long way</i>

01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:01.820
<i>The shining morning sun rising
in the East Sea</i>

01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:10.090
<i>Our beautiful mountains and rivers
Here lies my county</i>

01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:20.370
Doo-hwan?

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.270
Doo-hwan...

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:32.820
Doo-hwan...

01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:16.190
Mr. Chun did not carry out
his obligations

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.660
as a debtor to pay back
to the creditor.

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.800
Therefore, the Seoul Central District
Court will cease all sales

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.670
<i>and transactions of Mr Chun's property,
goods, and rights according to the law.</i>

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.610
Based on Articles 496
and 497 of the Constitution,

01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:35.710
<i>it will proceed in acquiring
and seizing his property.</i>

01:38:42.490 --> 01:38:45.050
Fuck, just grab anything you can.

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:48.320
Do we really have to do this?

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:53.530
It's money you should've
gotten anyways. Hurry up!

01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:02.770
How do I open this?

01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:04.850
Neither do I.
Just pack it and let's head home.

01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:06.840
Shit, you fucking retard.

01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:19.150
Don't take that off, sir.

01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:26.570
If you keep at it, I can charge you
for obstruction of justice.

01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:40.910
