WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.840
You can't turn back time
to stop what happened to Sarah.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.000
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.280
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again?

00:19.320 --> 00:23.600
Yes.
A nuclear warhead - Big Boy -

00:23.640 --> 00:24.000
was hijacked
while in transit yesterday.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
was hijacked
while in transit yesterday.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.400
The key's the detonator.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.320
You worked out where Big Boy is.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.240
It's Janet.
He's been sending money to her.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.480
Shiv would never betray the Lazarus.
I used to say that about Rebrov.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.000
Shiv's a mole. Always the ones
you least expect, isn't it?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.360
Shiv's a mole. Always the ones
you least expect, isn't it?

00:42.400 --> 00:44.720
Who are you?
I'm the caretaker.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.760
I wanna blow it up.
Excuse me?

00:47.800 --> 00:48.000
Like as soon as possible,
I wanna blow it up.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.360
Like as soon as possible,
I wanna blow it up.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400
Tonight, yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.680
Who keeps calling you?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.600
Work.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.960
You have a job?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, a part-time thing.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.320
Yeah, a part-time thing.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.760
Terrorism's like a...side hustle.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.000
Side hustle?
Yeah.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.800
Side hustle?
Yeah.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.760
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened to the others?

02:10.120 --> 02:12.360
When I asked you
if you were The Lost Glory

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
you said, "What's left of them."

02:15.240 --> 02:16.000
So what happened to the others?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.680
So what happened to the others?

02:21.160 --> 02:23.320
Have you ever
heard of The Lazarus Project?

02:23.360 --> 02:24.000
Yeah,
I heard they've taken down everyone

02:24.000 --> 02:26.240
Yeah,
I heard they've taken down everyone

02:26.280 --> 02:29.520
from The Last Church
of the Saviour to The Black Glove.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.000
They say that
you never hear them coming,

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
that they're always one step ahead.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.440
So now they've taken down The Glory?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Not all of us.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Not all of us.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.160
I hope I never meet them.
Don't worry about that.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.000
It's not like there are
any Lazarus agents here.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.840
It's not like there are
any Lazarus agents here.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.080
We're going to cross into Ruthenia
in 45 minutes.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.000
All right, we need to get
to a built-up area.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.800
All right, we need to get
to a built-up area.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.080
Chenupol is about a two-hour drive.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.880
Chenu...pol...

03:22.000 --> 03:25.160
You're just making this up
as you go along, aren't you?

03:27.280 --> 03:28.000
A little bit, yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.280
A little bit, yeah.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.000
And you're sure
no-one's on your tail?

03:36.000 --> 03:36.960
And you're sure
no-one's on your tail?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.640
No, we're clear.
On the home stretch now.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.800
We're almost there.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
Caretaker?

04:21.240 --> 04:23.080
Where is the bomb?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.000
I won't tell you.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.640
I won't tell you.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.400
I think you will.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.080
Without a detonator
the bomb is useless.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.320
And we can't sell a useless bomb.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.000
The Glory are on their way
to make the sale.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.120
The Glory are on their way
to make the sale.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.360
They will have a detonator.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.160
We just wait for them to turn up
and take it from them.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.480
Rudy, we will be
waiting for you at the site.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.000
When you have a visual
on the detonator,

05:04.000 --> 05:04.760
When you have a visual
on the detonator,

05:04.800 --> 05:07.680
you'll give us the signal.
And we move. Dah?

05:09.120 --> 05:10.720
Yeah.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.280
So, can I see it?
Can you see what?

05:27.320 --> 05:28.000
The detonator. Why'd you keep
asking to see the detonator?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.920
The detonator. Why'd you keep
asking to see the detonator?

05:30.960 --> 05:33.760
I'm in a truck
driving a nuclear warhead.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.000
I'd like to know the man next to me
at least has some idea
what he's doing.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.720
I'd like to know the man next to me
at least has some idea
what he's doing.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.320
It doesn't look like much.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.000
Are you sure it's gonna work?
Do you want to test it out now?

05:52.000 --> 05:52.560
Are you sure it's gonna work?
Do you want to test it out now?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.560
No!

05:54.600 --> 05:58.560
The bomb has an encrypted
transmitter built in.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.000
The detonator breaks down the
encryption and talks to the bomb.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.480
The detonator breaks down the
encryption and talks to the bomb.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.640
It's got a nine-digit
kill switch code

06:04.360 --> 06:07.440
and a four-point dial system
that has to be unlocked.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.200
Kind of like a safe.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.880
So, you're the only one
that can use it. That's right.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
We could torture him for the codes.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.080
We could torture him for the codes.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.440
We could make it
so he gives them to us willingly.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.040
Continue with his plan.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.000
Keep driving. We'll hijack them.
Incapacitate him.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.480
Keep driving. We'll hijack them.
Incapacitate him.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.960
Then make it seem as though
Rudy fought us off.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.000
If he wants the bomb detonated,
he'll give Rudy the codes.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.320
If he wants the bomb detonated,
he'll give Rudy the codes.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.160
And if that doesn't work?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.000
Well then you can torture him.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.400
Well then you can torture him.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.000
Do you mind me
asking you why? Why what?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Do you mind me
asking you why? Why what?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.360
Why do you want to blow up
this bomb?

07:26.080 --> 07:28.000
Er, The Lost Glory is dedicated

07:28.000 --> 07:28.920
Er, The Lost Glory is dedicated

07:28.960 --> 07:32.000
to acts of International Anarchic
Disruption and the -

07:32.040 --> 07:34.800
I've read your pamphlet.
Why are YOU doing this?

07:37.320 --> 07:41.000
I'm trying to save someone.
Pretty extreme way to go about it.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.960
Do you believe that doing
one good thing

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
can make the world a better place?

07:46.840 --> 07:48.800
It depends.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Cos what I'm just saying is
if you do one small thing -

07:52.000 --> 07:53.400
Cos what I'm just saying is
if you do one small thing -

07:54.200 --> 07:56.360
save a life, for example -

07:57.440 --> 08:00.000
that does make the world
a better place, right? I suppose so.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.480
that does make the world
a better place, right? I suppose so.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.760
So, then the effort it would
take to do that one small thing,

08:04.400 --> 08:08.000
to make the world a better place,
it's worth doing.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.400
to make the world a better place,
it's worth doing.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.640
That would be a noble cause.
I don't know if I'm the right person

08:11.680 --> 08:13.800
to talk to about a noble cause.
Why not?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.000
Well, I'm an arms dealer. So...

08:16.000 --> 08:17.040
Well, I'm an arms dealer. So...

08:18.800 --> 08:20.720
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Ever been in love?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
I don't know.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.000
Well, trust me,
if you had been, you would know.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.040
Well, trust me,
if you had been, you would know.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.960
So, what's love got to do
with setting off a warhead?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Fucking everything, man. Jesus.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.000
Love is a fucking nuclear bomb.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.320
Love is a fucking nuclear bomb.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.560
It goes off in your chest, it
irradiates your fucking brain cells.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
True. True.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.000
You'd do anything for it.
You'd do anything to protect it.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.480
And if you lose it,
you'd do anything to get it back.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.000
So you're blowing this up because...

08:56.000 --> 08:57.520
So you're blowing this up because...

08:57.560 --> 08:59.560
Cos...

08:59.600 --> 09:03.240
..I just want things to go
back to the way they were before.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.000
Trust me, man, things will
never go back to how they were.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.040
Trust me, man, things will
never go back to how they were.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.080
You'd be surprised.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.000
Whoa, what was that?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.680
Whoa, what was that?

09:20.720 --> 09:22.720
Er, I don't know.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.640
Tell me we're not breaking down.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.080
Shit!

09:33.560 --> 09:36.000
I told you we should have
got a better truck. Shut up.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.400
I told you we should have
got a better truck. Shut up.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.840
Seriously? Have
we seriously broken down right now?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.640
I... Shit. I...I don't know. Yeah.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.280
Well, maybe we should ask
those boys for some help.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.840
What do you reckon? Shall we
talk to those guys back there?

10:15.880 --> 10:16.000
They've been tailing us long enough.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.920
They've been tailing us long enough.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.000
Ah, fuck!
Fuck!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.640
Ah, fuck!
Fuck!

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
Rudy, what's going on?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.280
Rudy?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.560
Oh, shit.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.000
Argh!

11:36.000 --> 11:36.160
Argh!

11:49.080 --> 11:50.520
George.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.000
You're trapped.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.760
You're trapped.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.320
We just want the codes
to the detonator, that's all.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.240
Why is it so fucking difficult?!

13:52.440 --> 13:54.200
Grrr!

15:11.480 --> 15:12.000
George? It's George? Ssh!

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
George? It's George? Ssh!

15:14.040 --> 15:16.320
George?
Archie.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.360
Tell me you've got him.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.000
I tried. He pulled a gun on me.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.720
I tried. He pulled a gun on me.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
Where is he?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.040
He shot me in the shoulder.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.000
I couldn't.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.080
I couldn't.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.200
I tried but I couldn't.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.120
George? Shit.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.000
Oh, Jesus.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.680
Oh, Jesus.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.920
Reports of a detonation. A big one.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.840
People on social media
are describing a mushroom cloud.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.000
Do we have satellite yet?
Hold on.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.280
Do we have satellite yet?
Hold on.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.000
Find out if George or Shiv
are still alive.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.680
Find out if George or Shiv
are still alive.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.560
Get them back here.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.240
George?
Yeah, the bomb went off.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.200
I know it did. Where are you?
Driving very fast away from it.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.000
OK. I'm gonna get you home.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.520
OK. I'm gonna get you home.

17:45.560 --> 17:49.240
You'll have a lot of questions
to answer when you get here. I know.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.520
They're shutting the airport,
but I got you on one of
the last flights out.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
It's a private charter
to London City.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.680
It's a private charter
to London City.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.720
OK. How bad is it?

18:03.640 --> 18:05.400
We don't know yet.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
I fucked up.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.600
Just come home.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.680
Mm-hm.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.360
There are no planes running, sir.
I know. I'm George Addo.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
You should have had a call.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.920
I'll take you through.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
You all right?

19:21.040 --> 19:22.760
Where're you heading, bro?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
Er, London.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.880
We're...we're gonna play London.

19:27.920 --> 19:28.000
Yeah. Camden, baby. You know it?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.360
Yeah. Camden, baby. You know it?

19:33.480 --> 19:35.960
Yeah, I know Camden.
Cool.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
Hey, you're not a narc, are you?

19:42.360 --> 19:44.000
No. Cool. Then let's
get the fuck out of here, huh?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.720
No. Cool. Then let's
get the fuck out of here, huh?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.800
send your body to flight

19:53.440 --> 19:55.920
and you ladies, let's fly

19:55.960 --> 19:57.920
like you grippin' the earth

19:57.960 --> 19:59.920
and you feelin' the girth

20:01.440 --> 20:04.720
when everything thing used to hurt

20:04.760 --> 20:06.760
It's like the end of the world, man.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.000
The whole system's coming down.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.760
The whole system's coming down.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.960
Ragnarok.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.560
Hey, man, do you want some drugs?

20:34.080 --> 20:36.280
Actually, yeah. Go on, then.
Yeah?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.320
Knock yourself out!

20:42.360 --> 20:44.360
Camden's gonna be fun, then, huh?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.600
Arhhh!

21:26.800 --> 21:28.000
Please be codeine.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.360
Please be codeine.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.000
to do with his mind

22:00.000 --> 22:01.800
to do with his mind

22:04.360 --> 22:08.000
is now dance with the devil

22:08.000 --> 22:08.200
is now dance with the devil

22:15.080 --> 22:16.000
All right?

22:16.000 --> 22:16.240
All right?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.880
Hello.
You were talking in your sleep.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.760
What about?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.000
Just a load of nonsense.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.520
Just a load of nonsense.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.840
Mm. Same as usual, then.
Exactly.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.600
Bad dream, was it?
Yeah.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.000
Nightmare.
Oof. What about?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.600
Nightmare.
Oof. What about?

22:38.280 --> 22:40.000
I don't really remember.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.960
I don't really remember.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.000
What do you want to do today?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.880
Huh?
What do you want to do?

22:47.920 --> 22:48.000
I was thinking we could go out.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.600
I was thinking we could go out.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.560
But we're gonna have to be quick,
what with all this.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.720
I, er, dunno.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.640
I think I had something
I wanted to say to you.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.200
Oh, yeah? What?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.160
I don't know.
I can't remember. I was -

23:02.200 --> 23:04.000
You need to be quick. I can
barely hear you above the noise.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.280
You need to be quick. I can
barely hear you above the noise.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.520
I wanted to ask you something.
What?

23:07.560 --> 23:10.120
I wanted to ask you something!
I can't hear you.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.520
I wanted to ask...

23:17.600 --> 23:20.000
'Welcome to London.
We hope you had a pleasant flight

23:20.000 --> 23:20.120
'Welcome to London.
We hope you had a pleasant flight

23:20.160 --> 23:22.880
and look forward
to you flying with us again.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.080
We kindly ask you
to remain in your seats

23:25.120 --> 23:27.760
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.'

23:33.640 --> 23:35.080
Cheers.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.000
Hey, good luck man.
Yeah, bye, dude.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.080
Hey, good luck man.
Yeah, bye, dude.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.440
Remember, the whole fucking
system's coming down, dude!

23:41.480 --> 23:43.520
Fuckin' nutcase.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.360
The intelligence we have
right now

23:46.400 --> 23:49.960
is that Shiv may somehow
be connected to the detonation.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.960
That's not possible.
It's not likely.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.400
But it's not impossible.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.240
Until we know for sure,
we're taking it seriously.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.480
Where's this intel from?
When we're ready, we'll tell you.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.000
Here's what we DO know.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.840
Here's what we DO know.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.240
Miraculously, it seems like the body
count is gonna be pretty low.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.520
Blast radius was mostly countryside.
A few suburbs.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.000
Big Boy would have been
on a large container.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.280
Big Boy would have been
on a large container.

24:10.320 --> 24:15.120
So, any information about lorries,
trucks, 16-wheelers.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.000
Anything suspicious,
anything stolen, anything missing,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Anything suspicious,
anything stolen, anything missing,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.360
I want to know about it.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.000
OK.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.560
OK.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.800
Get to work.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.320
Agent Addo.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
Start from the beginning.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.600
I cracked the code.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.000
The Lost Glory maps.
Why didn't you come to me?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.320
The Lost Glory maps.
Why didn't you come to me?

25:54.360 --> 25:56.280
I tried.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
I called but Shiv answered.

25:59.840 --> 26:00.000
You can check my phone records
if you want.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.120
You can check my phone records
if you want.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.040
What did you say to him?

26:04.080 --> 26:06.560
That I thought I knew
where the bomb might be.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.000
He said he'd look into it.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.840
He said he'd look into it.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.480
I told him I wanted to go
and check it out myself.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.960
That was pretty much
the end of the conversation.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.120
You wanted
to "check it out" yourself?

26:18.160 --> 26:21.040
Look, I wanted to go
and find the bomb myself, OK?

26:21.080 --> 26:24.000
Yeah. I wanted to find it,
show everyone.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.200
Yeah. I wanted to find it,
show everyone.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.520
What are you, fucking ten years old?
You wanted to show everyone?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.720
Yeah, I got in over my head.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.240
I'll say.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.640
What happened?

26:45.680 --> 26:48.000
He must've tailed me from London.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.040
He must've tailed me from London.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.960
Shiv?
Yeah.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.560
How?
I don't know.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.000
But he caught up with me.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.000
I thought he was there to help me,
but he drew his gun.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.560
I thought he was there to help me,
but he drew his gun.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.400
So, I ran.
He chased after me, but I got away.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.400
Lost him.
And then what did you do?

27:03.440 --> 27:04.000
I went to where I thought
the bomb might be...

27:04.000 --> 27:06.360
I went to where I thought
the bomb might be...

27:06.400 --> 27:08.760
er, but it'd already gone.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.120
Luckily, I caught sight
of this car driving away

27:11.160 --> 27:12.000
and I thought it might be Shiv,
so...I followed.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.040
and I thought it might be Shiv,
so...I followed.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.920
And I saw him with these men
with the covered lorry.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.000
But he must have spotted me first

27:20.000 --> 27:20.720
But he must have spotted me first

27:20.760 --> 27:23.400
because he was waiting for me
up the road. He shot at me.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.000
He hit me in the shoulder,
drove away.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.000
I tried to follow him
but...with my arm...

27:28.000 --> 27:30.160
I tried to follow him
but...with my arm...

27:31.800 --> 27:35.080
So, you lost him
and then the bomb went off?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.680
Yeah.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.000
Did you speak to Shiv
while all this was going on

27:44.000 --> 27:45.600
Did you speak to Shiv
while all this was going on

27:45.640 --> 27:50.360
or did he just turn up and shoot
at you with no explanation?

27:51.680 --> 27:52.000
He didn't stop to chat.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.760
He didn't stop to chat.

27:56.080 --> 28:00.000
There's erm... There's something
else I need you to see.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.080
There's erm... There's something
else I need you to see.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.840
What's this?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.520
I ran Shiv's account through my app

28:06.560 --> 28:08.000
and...

28:08.000 --> 28:08.080
and...

28:09.440 --> 28:12.960
..he's been sending money to Janet.
For years.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.680
I'll have everything on your phone
downloaded and checked over.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.120
If there is anything on here
that incriminates you in any way,

28:23.160 --> 28:24.000
I promise, it will help your case
if you tell me about it now.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.520
I promise, it will help your case
if you tell me about it now.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.640
I've got nothing to hide.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.200
So, what's the body count?
Hmm?

28:46.040 --> 28:48.000
From the bomb.
How many people are dead?

28:48.000 --> 28:48.320
From the bomb.
How many people are dead?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.320
We think a couple of hundred.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.440
Couple of hundred?
For now.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.440
What happens next?

29:10.480 --> 29:12.000
Wes is gonna go
and talk to the Russian Ambassador.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.920
Wes is gonna go
and talk to the Russian Ambassador.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.680
But is she likely to know anything?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.920
Russia have launched a nuclear
arsenal against us three times.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.000
Belov was smuggled
out of the country
prior to the strike each time.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.600
Belov was smuggled
out of the country
prior to the strike each time.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.720
If Belov's at home, it's a good sign
they're not planning anything

29:24.760 --> 29:26.640
and we won't have to step in.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.200
Ma'am.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.000
The downloads
from Ryan and Shiv's devices.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.640
The downloads
from Ryan and Shiv's devices.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.400
Have you looked at them?
Yes, ma'am.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.400
And?
It doesn't look good.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.000
Thank you, Greta.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.280
Thank you, Greta.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.440
I need to call Ryan's family.

30:04.440 --> 30:08.000
I told Rebrov that he had a wife and
child, but actually I don't know -

30:08.000 --> 30:08.520
I told Rebrov that he had a wife and
child, but actually I don't know -

30:08.560 --> 30:11.880
He had a girlfriend.
I put the number on there.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.240
Thank you, Greta.

30:39.960 --> 30:40.000
What's the kill command?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.280
What's the kill command?

30:45.240 --> 30:48.000
What did Ryan say to you
to make you break his neck?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.680
What did Ryan say to you
to make you break his neck?

30:48.720 --> 30:51.000
Big plans are afoot.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.000
Not the news you were hoping for.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.480
Not the news you were hoping for.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
George.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.720
Come with me.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.640
When I met Shiv,
he was still a teenager.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.600
Naive, scared. Arrogant.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.520
I always thought, if he hadn't
been born with the gift,

31:57.560 --> 31:59.520
would we have recruited him?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.840
Shiv's a better agent than The Dane.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.920
He's better than Greta -
Archie, even.

32:07.960 --> 32:08.000
But you know what they have
that he doesn't?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.360
But you know what they have
that he doesn't?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.960
They can forget what they do,
just for five minutes.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
They can live in the world.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.560
They can live in the world.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.320
Shiv never could.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.080
Why am I here, ma'am?

32:23.920 --> 32:24.000
Because sometimes
you can stop a war

32:24.000 --> 32:25.880
Because sometimes
you can stop a war

32:25.920 --> 32:28.280
with a conversation
instead of a gun.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.200
And I think that's a lesson
that you need to learn.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.720
Wes.
Ambassador Belov.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.720
More security than usual.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.000
No. Just more visible than usual.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.280
No. Just more visible than usual.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.520
Thank you for seeing me again.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.000
This is my colleague, Agent Addo.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.680
This is my colleague, Agent Addo.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.840
Ambassador.
I haven't had a lot of sleep,

33:23.880 --> 33:27.400
as you can probably imagine,
so shall we skip straight to it?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.000
We don't think you're under attack.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.720
We don't think you're under attack.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.120
A nuclear bomb just went off
on our front lawn.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.920
Don't tell me we're not under attack
when we just got attacked.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.640
So...

33:41.720 --> 33:43.720
..what do you know?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.000
We know the bomb was one of yours.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.760
We know the bomb was one of yours.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.680
It was stolen by a militia group
earlier this year

33:48.720 --> 33:51.640
and traded to a third party
for sale on the black market.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.000
If I steal your gun
and shoot you with it,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.200
If I steal your gun
and shoot you with it,

33:54.240 --> 33:56.360
does that make you the murderer?

33:56.400 --> 33:58.640
We just want to know
what Russia will do next.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.000
Well, you have satellite images.
What do you think we'll do next?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.920
Well, you have satellite images.
What do you think we'll do next?

34:01.960 --> 34:05.000
I wouldn't presume
to second guess the Kremlin.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.040
We're doing
what everyone else is doing -

34:07.080 --> 34:08.000
trying to work out
who is behind this

34:08.000 --> 34:08.840
trying to work out
who is behind this

34:08.880 --> 34:11.720
and whether this is the end of it,
or just the beginning.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.720
Well, none of
the information we have

34:13.760 --> 34:16.000
suggests this was done
in an official capacity.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.040
suggests this was done
in an official capacity.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.240
You mean,
the bomb wasn't dropped from a plane

34:19.280 --> 34:22.960
with a fluttering Stars and Stripes
sticking out the back?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
No.

34:24.000 --> 34:24.880
No.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.280
It doesn't mean
our enemies weren't involved.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.040
The Americans aren't gonna
start a war with you.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.000
Despite what you might think,

34:32.000 --> 34:32.480
Despite what you might think,

34:32.520 --> 34:37.000
Russia does not wake up every day
looking for excuses to start a war.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.840
Your Northern fleet is in
battle formation in the Bering Sea.

34:39.880 --> 34:40.000
So?
So, it wasn't this morning.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.120
So?
So, it wasn't this morning.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.080
The bomb went off
in the middle of nowhere.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.000
The question we're asking ourselves
is which direction was it heading?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.360
The question we're asking ourselves
is which direction was it heading?

34:57.400 --> 34:59.080
Towards us or away?

34:59.120 --> 35:03.600
Ambassador, we just came to give you
our professional opinion.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.000
You keep baring your teeth
at everyone,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.840
You keep baring your teeth
at everyone,

35:06.880 --> 35:09.400
but we don't think you need to.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.000
Russia lives with her teeth bared.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.040
Russia lives with her teeth bared.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.600
There will not be a warning
before we bite.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.000
Well, what do you think?

35:28.000 --> 35:28.880
Well, what do you think?

35:32.120 --> 35:34.480
I think,
if something was about to kick off,

35:34.520 --> 35:36.000
she wouldn't take the time
to talk with us.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.080
she wouldn't take the time
to talk with us.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.520
And I certainly don't think
her son and husband

35:40.560 --> 35:43.320
would still be in the house
while she did it.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.640
'Yes?'

36:30.680 --> 36:32.000
There's the body of a British agent
in the boot of a blue Fiat

36:32.000 --> 36:33.600
There's the body of a British agent
in the boot of a blue Fiat

36:33.640 --> 36:36.640
by the farmhouse a few miles
north of Brasov, Romania.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.520
This house was being used as a base

36:38.560 --> 36:40.000
by the arms dealers
who stole your bomb.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.720
by the arms dealers
who stole your bomb.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.480
Who is this?

36:42.520 --> 36:44.760
'The detonation wasn't an accident.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.120
It was coordinated by a task force.'

36:47.160 --> 36:48.000
More attacks are being planned
as part of an aggressive push
to weaken your hold.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.120
More attacks are being planned
as part of an aggressive push
to weaken your hold.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.480
The American fleet have moved
into the Sea of Japan.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.000
Get Admiral Amos on the phone
and patched through to Wes' office.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.440
Get Admiral Amos on the phone
and patched through to Wes' office.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.440
What proof do you have?
Have a look at your borders.

36:59.480 --> 37:03.880
Right now, the American fleet have
just moved into the Sea of Japan.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.000
'We know
what our enemies are doing.'

37:04.000 --> 37:05.760
'We know
what our enemies are doing.'

37:05.800 --> 37:07.960
I don't think you do. Blue Fiat.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.800
Farmhouse. Brasov. Find the body.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.000
The British are involved in this.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.040
The British are involved in this.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.440
Get out!

37:37.720 --> 37:41.600
'..calls for calm following
reports of a nuclear explosion.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.960
We're awaiting
further details of this

37:44.000 --> 37:47.480
and will keep you updated
as soon as we receive new updates

37:47.520 --> 37:49.800
and confirmation...'

37:53.840 --> 37:56.200
Andreas, let him in.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.360
We found the body in the car.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.000
His name is Shiv Reddy -
I'd like to get you
on a plane to Moscow.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.200
His name is Shiv Reddy -
I'd like to get you
on a plane to Moscow.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.560
No, we don't have time for that.
You need to move now.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.240
You need to strike first.
I don't make that decision,

38:22.280 --> 38:23.880
Agent Addo. Neither do you.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.000
Talk to your generals in Moscow -
I knew Agent Reddy.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.760
Talk to your generals in Moscow -
I knew Agent Reddy.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.360
Quite well, in fact.
You? You I don't know at all.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.960
Talk to whoever you need to,
but I'm telling you,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.560
there are multiple attacks planned
that will cripple your defences

38:35.600 --> 38:38.840
if you don't act now!
Multiple attacks where, Agent Addo?

38:38.880 --> 38:40.000
Against whom?

38:40.000 --> 38:40.800
Against whom?

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
You!

39:19.240 --> 39:20.000
Don't.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.800
Don't.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.000
Nyet! Nyet!

39:28.000 --> 39:29.200
Nyet! Nyet!

39:36.080 --> 39:38.560
Is there a panic button in here?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.720
Press it.

40:23.760 --> 40:24.000
Oh, shit!

40:24.000 --> 40:26.840
Oh, shit!

40:26.880 --> 40:29.960
It's a missile launch.
It's a fucking missile launch!

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Troops have crossed the border!

40:32.000 --> 40:32.120
Troops have crossed the border!

40:32.160 --> 40:34.760
Multiple missile strikes
against compounds.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.040
OK, listen up.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.000
We are resetting the clock.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.280
We are resetting the clock.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.520
Now, there are two things.
We lose Rebrov.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.080
We know he'll wake up in Paris

40:44.120 --> 40:46.680
and I'll send a team out there
to close the net on him.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.000
Second thing... Shiv.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.640
Second thing... Shiv.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.680
The moment you open your eyes
at the checkpoint,

40:51.720 --> 40:55.080
I want everyone
to move on his location.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.000
I want him brought in.
I do not want him hurt.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.480
I want him brought in.
I do not want him hurt.

40:59.480 --> 41:03.040
Clock goes back in...one minute.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.600
Hi.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.000
Hi.

41:36.000 --> 41:36.280
Hi.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.920
Are... Are you all right?

41:41.440 --> 41:43.600
Yeah, I'm fine.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.160
Son of a bitch.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.000
Feels Like We Only Go Backwards

42:08.000 --> 42:11.400
Feels Like We Only Go Backwards

42:15.480 --> 42:16.000
Oh, George.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.120
Oh, George.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.480
I hope you're already running.
