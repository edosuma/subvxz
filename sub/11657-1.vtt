00:52.467 --> 00:54.133
I taught a class today,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.233
the finest school in Dade County.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.100
Two girls had shaved heads
and three boys had green hair.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.900
-They're expressing themselves.
-Yeah, well, I expressed myself.

01:04.967 --> 01:07.734
I told them they had to leave.
They were too ugly to look at.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.233
Now the parents are mad.

01:11.533 --> 01:15.266
A father came in in a three-piece suit
and defended Tiffany,

01:15.333 --> 01:17.500
a bald girl with a nose ring.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.934
-What's that?
-Enchiladas rancheros.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.567
Why don't you just shoot me?

01:25.300 --> 01:27.433
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, Rose.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.166
(sighs) What a day!

01:29.233 --> 01:31.467
One sad person after another.

01:31.533 --> 01:33.767
Rose, you work
at grief counseling.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.767
What do you expect, comedians?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.867
Well, it would be a change of pace.

01:38.934 --> 01:41.133
Oh, Dorothy, can I borrow
your mink stole?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.600
It's Miami in June.
Only cats are wearing fur.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.166
-You going out?
-No, no.

01:47.233 --> 01:51.166
She's going to sit here where it's
112 degrees and eat enchiladas.

01:52.433 --> 01:55.333
I just need some cucumbers
to put on my eyes.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.467
You'll have trouble seeing, Blanche.

01:58.567 --> 02:00.967
It's very good.
It reduces puffiness.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.700
Does it work on thighs?

02:05.066 --> 02:07.633
I don't know, honey.
I don't need it on my thighs.

02:10.567 --> 02:13.567
-Who's she going out with?
-Harry... again.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.500
Harry? Who is this Harry?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.133
All Blanche said was he still has
his own teeth and hair.

02:20.567 --> 02:23.367
Oh, it is wonderful dating in Miami.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.767
All the single men under 80
are cocaine smugglers.

02:29.166 --> 02:33.633
-You know, I'd kill to be 20 again.
-Oh, I would kill to be 40 again.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.700
Oh... you know, I had
the shock of my life today.

02:38.033 --> 02:42.300
I was in the teachers' lounge
talking to a group of girls in their 20s.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.367
Oh, they were so pretty.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.934
At that age, you don't even have
to be pretty and you're pretty.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.533
Anyway, we were laughing and giggling
and having a great time,

02:50.600 --> 02:52.533
and I completely forgot
that I was older.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.200
I just felt like one of the girls
and we had a wonderful time.

02:56.867 --> 03:00.400
And then I got into my car
and caught a glimpse of myself,

03:00.467 --> 03:03.000
and I almost had a heart attack.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.967
This old woman was in the mirror.
I didn't even recognize her.

03:09.867 --> 03:11.033
Who was it?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.967
-It was me.
-Oh.

03:24.033 --> 03:26.166
Oh, Rose, I'm borrowing
your earrings.

03:26.233 --> 03:29.033
Lord, I'd love to get
a face-lift by 8:00.

03:29.633 --> 03:33.667
Blanche... who is Harry?

03:33.734 --> 03:35.500
Oh, girls, he's just wonderful.

03:35.567 --> 03:38.667
He's very gallant,
he's a perfect gentleman,

03:38.734 --> 03:40.800
he's a great dancer,

03:40.867 --> 03:43.133
and he doesn't make noises
when he chews.

03:43.734 --> 03:46.533
Chewing, that's way up there on my list.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.266
Comes right after intelligent.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.166
He doesn't talk loud at the movies,
doesn't take his own pulse...

03:53.533 --> 03:56.066
and he's still interested.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.967
In what?

04:00.834 --> 04:05.133
Rose, if you have to ask,
it does not matter anymore.

04:06.967 --> 04:09.433
And he proposed.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.800
Blanche, wait a minute!

04:14.467 --> 04:17.300
He proposed?
You've only known him a week!

04:17.367 --> 04:19.934
-And he wants an answer tonight.
-Tonight?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.433
Ton... what are you gonna tell him?

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
I don't know. You know,
he's very wonderful,

04:25.567 --> 04:28.166
-but I have only known him for a week.
-That's right.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.967
But I don't want to lose him.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.400
Girls, I just don't know
what I'm gonna tell him.

04:33.133 --> 04:34.834
I have to go put on my face.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.233
What if she marries him?

04:39.967 --> 04:42.166
What'll happen to us?
This house is hers.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.633
Then we'll move.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.633
We can't afford to buy a house.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.000
What do we have for collateral?
A gay cook?

04:51.233 --> 04:54.100
Oh, come on, Rose.
Nobody is getting married.

04:54.166 --> 04:58.233
-Now, let's go talk to Blanche.
-Dorothy, we'll become bag ladies!

05:03.000 --> 05:04.266
-(knock on door)
-(Dorothy) Blanche?

05:04.333 --> 05:05.367
Come in.

05:06.300 --> 05:10.033
Blanche, Blanche, your friend, Harry,
wants an answer tonight.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.066
-What are you gonna tell him?
-I haven't decided.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.433
I guess I'll know when I hear it come
out of my mouth.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.633
You'll know when you hear it
come out of your mouth?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.233
This isn't a belch, Blanche.
This is marriage!

05:21.433 --> 05:22.333
Will you look at this?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.066
She has more colors
than Benjamin Moore paints.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.233
You mustn't rush into anything, Blanche.
You hardly know him.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.900
I just wonder what my husband, George,
would think about me and Harry.

05:32.967 --> 05:36.200
Well, if he was alive,
he probably would not like it...

05:37.567 --> 05:40.500
but since he's dead,
I don't think it poses a problem.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.967
I just want him to know
that I'm happy

05:43.033 --> 05:45.834
but that I could never be
as happy with Harry...

05:46.166 --> 05:48.400
in the same way as I was with him.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.667
He knows, Blanche, he knows.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.467
Your thoughts and feelings
go right to him.

05:54.533 --> 05:57.033
You can communicate directly
from your heart.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.767
-Can't you, Dorothy?
-Oh, don't ask me.

05:58.834 --> 06:01.633
I can't get through to New Jersey
with MCI.

06:02.867 --> 06:04.066
(doorbell rings)

06:04.633 --> 06:07.100
That's him. He's early!
I haven't finished my face.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.133
Well, the only thing left
is to dip it in bronze.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.266
-We'll get it.
-Thanks.

06:13.633 --> 06:14.967
I wonder what he looks like.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.200
I just hope he doesn't
have hair in his ears.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.567
-Hi there.
-Ma!

06:29.300 --> 06:30.567
Ma, what's the matter?

06:30.633 --> 06:33.500
Everyone is fine, no one died.
The home burned down.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.633
My God, are you all right?
How'd you get here?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.800
-I hitched.
-Oh, ma!

06:38.867 --> 06:42.433
-A cab. I took a cab.
-Well, you should've called.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.767
I'm perfectly capable of managing
by myself. I don't need help.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.700
-I'm a totally independent person.
-I know, I know.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.934
I need $67 for the cab.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.600
$67?

06:55.934 --> 06:59.500
Ma, ma, this is crazy.
The home is 15 minutes from here.

06:59.567 --> 07:00.834
My cab driver is Cuban.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.767
He said there was an additional tax
for a bilingual driver.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.867
I'll take care of him.

07:08.133 --> 07:11.133
Sit down, Sophia.
You must be exhausted.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.500
Why? I rode in the cab,
I didn't push it.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.934
Oh, Sophia, honey!
How nice to see you.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.367
-Who are you?
-It's me, Blanche.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.200
You look like a prostitute.

07:26.867 --> 07:30.433
Sophia, the things you say!
She didn't mean that, Blanche.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.633
Of course, I mean it. Look at her.
My cab driver would fall in love.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.667
Can I get something to eat,
or is the fancy man in the kitchen?

07:41.100 --> 07:42.700
The way she talks!

07:42.767 --> 07:43.834
She can't help it.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.133
Oh, I've known plenty of women
who have had strokes.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.066
Some of them were in very bad shape,
but they're still ladies.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.633
But, Rose, this stroke destroyed
the part of her brain

07:53.700 --> 07:55.367
that censors what she says.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.767
So she just says whatever she thinks.
She can't help it.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.567
He's an ok petunia.

08:00.433 --> 08:05.900
Ma, ma, the cab driver said
you promised him a $67 tip?

08:05.967 --> 08:09.767
Don't be silly.
I said a $6, $7 tip.

08:10.033 --> 08:12.100
Why don't these people learn English
if they're gonna live here?

08:12.166 --> 08:13.166
This is Miami.

08:13.233 --> 08:15.467
I'd have less trouble
getting around Ecuador.

08:16.834 --> 08:19.300
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, I'll get it.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.734
-Harry, hi.
-Ah, my pretty.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.467
Oh, Harry. Everybody, this is Harry.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.500
-Harry, this is Rose.
-Rose.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.100
-And Dorothy.
-Dorothy.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.700
-Hi, Harry.
-And this is Sophia.

08:32.266 --> 08:36.533
-Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
-You must be blind.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.934
(Blanche chuckles)

08:40.000 --> 08:43.834
-Sophia's home just burned down.
-Oh, that's terrible!

08:43.900 --> 08:45.166
Not to me.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.500
It was a retirement home
and you know what they did?

08:48.567 --> 08:51.400
They set off the fire alarm
in a retirement home.

08:51.467 --> 08:54.300
Who can rush?
Half the people have walkers.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.233
The other half can't
get out of their chairs.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.667
But they got bells
going off like crazy.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.367
You know what that does to hearts
that only beat a few times a week?

09:04.700 --> 09:05.967
It's not pretty.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.200
Uh, we better go.
We have reservations.

09:12.266 --> 09:14.367
I hope he's taking you
to a cold climate.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.533
Good night. Thanks, ladies.
It was a pleasure.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.633
(Dorothy) Nice meeting you,
Harry. Have fun!

09:19.700 --> 09:22.100
The man is a scuzzball.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.166
This is so sad.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.867
We were all so lonely,

09:42.934 --> 09:45.300
and then by a miracle
we found each other.

09:45.367 --> 09:49.633
Rose, we both answered an ad
to share Blanche's house

09:49.700 --> 09:51.433
that we found in the supermarket.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.266
It was not the resurrection.
It is hardly a miracle.

09:54.967 --> 09:58.166
To me it was a miracle,
because we're happy.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.767
It's not fair, you know.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.433
I mean, we get married,
we have kids...

10:04.867 --> 10:06.967
the kids leave and our husbands die.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.633
Is that some kind of a test?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.066
You don't work that hard,

10:11.133 --> 10:15.400
you don't go through everything you
go through to be left alone.

10:16.433 --> 10:19.633
We are alone, Dorothy.
We really are.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.667
Our families are gone and we're alone.

10:24.533 --> 10:28.133
And there are too many years left,
and I don't know what to do.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.367
Get a poodle.

10:40.967 --> 10:43.033
-It's yes. I know it is.
-She's gonna marry him.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.867
Oh, come on, Rose.

10:44.934 --> 10:48.066
She can't help it.
Blanche needs a man.

10:48.633 --> 10:53.100
She told me, when George died,
she made a date at the funeral.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.433
Oh, not that she didn't love George.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.300
She can't be without a man.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.066
You know what I'm saying?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.667
What am I doing up?

11:09.934 --> 11:12.467
I'm subbing for a teacher
who was shot by a student.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.333
I need all the sleep I can get.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.600
I used to sleep so well.
I never even turned over.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.233
I'd wake up with a perfect hairdo.

11:22.567 --> 11:26.066
Charlie, on the other hand,
moves all night long.

11:26.133 --> 11:29.000
His side of the bed looks
like a murder took place.

11:29.066 --> 11:31.867
-Rose, Charlie is dead.
-Why tell her?

11:33.734 --> 11:35.834
Coco, it's 15 years!

11:35.900 --> 11:38.300
I know he's dead. I'm not crazy.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.967
I just like to talk about him
in the present tense sometimes.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.800
It makes him seem closer.

11:43.867 --> 11:46.133
That's fine, Rose. You do that.
I don't mind at all.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.667
Sure, Rose. Set a place at the table.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.667
-Well, hi!
-What happened?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.000
Oh, we had the nicest time.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.667
We went to Joe's.
You ever been to Joe's?

11:57.734 --> 12:00.200
-Yes, what happened?
-I had the stone crabs.

12:00.266 --> 12:01.900
I never had stone crabs.
You ever have stone crabs?

12:01.967 --> 12:03.367
Yes, yes, Blanche. Just tell us.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.767
Oh, I was just so relieved
they didn't have eyes.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.400
You know, I can't eat anything
with eyes, like lobster.

12:08.467 --> 12:12.133
-I can't eat anything that moves.
-Like what, Rose? Horses?

12:15.967 --> 12:17.967
-Like oysters.
-Oysters don't move!

12:18.033 --> 12:20.633
Coco, they could dance! Who cares?

12:21.934 --> 12:23.967
-Tell us.
-Oysters move!

12:24.033 --> 12:27.967
Very slowly.
You have to watch very closely.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.066
-Blanche, are you gonna marry Harry?
-Marry Harry, marry Harry.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.867
-A little rhyme.
-Knock it off. Are you?

12:42.433 --> 12:44.066
Yes. Next week.

12:51.533 --> 12:54.367
I knew it.
I knew she was gonna marry him.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.900
But next week?

12:56.967 --> 13:00.100
At our age, long engagements
don't make sense.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.100
I have to go to bed.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.033
-Where will you live?
-Well, here.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.400
-Where will we live?
-Oh, don't worry. We'll live, we'll live.

13:08.467 --> 13:12.567
-Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
-It's so hard to find a place to live.

13:12.633 --> 13:17.166
-Well, you can just stay right here.
-Well, that's settled.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.233
Oh, Rose.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.734
How could we stay here
with Blanche and Harry?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.867
-Well, she just said!
-You certainly can until you find a place.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.800
However long that takes.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.800
We're going to New York
for the honeymoon.

13:30.233 --> 13:31.834
I just hope I don't get murdered.

13:39.266 --> 13:42.900
Charlie and I waited two whole
years before we got married.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.867
I got married before my father
finished the sentence.

13:45.934 --> 13:47.333
You married your father?

13:51.166 --> 13:54.900
My father told Stan that he had to marry
me. I was pregnant.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.767
You had a blowgun wedding?

14:02.367 --> 14:04.567
If you live in the Amazon.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.433
In Queens, it's called shotgun.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.400
Well, maybe that's why he left,
because you forced him into it.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.867
Rose, he left me 38 years later...

14:15.433 --> 14:18.700
for a stewardess that he met
on a business trip to Hawaii.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.433
It was her first flight.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.433
They said, "On arrival,
give the passengers a lei."

14:23.500 --> 14:24.967
She got confused...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.700
he got lucky,
and they now live on Maui.

14:37.633 --> 14:38.700
Oh, it's really wonderful.

14:38.767 --> 14:42.834
A 65-year-old man with gout
learning to windsurf.

14:43.633 --> 14:47.033
I hope he trips on his thongs
and falls into a volcano.

14:48.367 --> 14:51.667
-Oh, it's you.
-Oh, Sophia, did we wake you?

14:51.734 --> 14:54.867
I heard noise. I thought it was robbers,
so I hid my jewels.

14:54.934 --> 14:56.533
Now I can't remember where.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.433
Ma, you don't have any jewels.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.233
Thank God, because I can't find them.

15:04.667 --> 15:05.834
Tea, Sophia?

15:06.433 --> 15:08.834
How about a shot of gin
with a beer back?

15:11.333 --> 15:14.033
That was dumb of me
to have tea this late.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.367
Now I'll go to sleep
and have to get up to go.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.800
And wake me up.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.066
If you didn't drink before bedtime,

15:20.133 --> 15:21.934
you wouldn't have to wake up
in the middle of the night.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.567
I don't drink before bedtime.

15:23.633 --> 15:27.200
I stop all liquids at noon
and I still wake up.

15:27.266 --> 15:31.066
I never have that problem, never.
I sleep like a log.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.734
I never get up
in the middle of the night

15:32.800 --> 15:33.967
to go to the bathroom.

15:34.033 --> 15:37.467
I go in the morning,
every morning like clockwork.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.467
At 7am, I pee.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.333
Unfortunately, I don't
wake up till eight.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.166
-Where's Blanche?
-In the bathroom.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.800
-I've gotta talk to you.
-What is it?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.633
I know this sounds crazy,
but I'm suspicious.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.867
-Of what?
-Harry.

16:11.934 --> 16:14.133
-Harry?
-And I don't know why.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.266
There's just something
about it I don't like...

16:16.800 --> 16:18.233
and I have to tell Blanche.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.633
-Tell Blanche what?
-That she can't marry him.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.767
The wedding is in 12 minutes!
You can't tell her that.

16:23.834 --> 16:27.300
-I owe it to her. I'm her friend.
-But there's nothing to tell her.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.133
This is just some crazy hunch.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.633
My hunches are never wrong.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.867
Mrs. Gandhi would be alive today
if she had taken my call.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.834
-I'm gonna tell her.
-You are not.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.433
-I will not let you.
-I can't stop crying.

16:44.767 --> 16:47.033
I'm so happy and so sad.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.967
Kind of a happy sad.

16:49.033 --> 16:51.200
-Speaking of sad, Blanche--
-Shut up, Rose.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.734
She's crying already.
What's the difference?

16:54.800 --> 16:55.934
Rose, pick that up.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.233
I just can't believe it.
I'm getting married!

17:06.300 --> 17:09.433
-What do you think about that?
-I think it's a mistake.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.233
To wear all that makeup.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.533
I know it's fast,

17:14.600 --> 17:17.433
but I just don't know
when I'll find another like him.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.734
He just... oh, girls, girls,

17:19.800 --> 17:22.900
he makes me feel so good,
so young, so happy.

17:22.967 --> 17:27.066
Aw. Rose, did you hear that? So happy.

17:30.233 --> 17:32.633
Now I have to go
to the bathroom again.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.834
You know, when I get nervous,
I have to go all the time.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.934
That's why I'm getting
married here at the house.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.333
Public bathrooms are so difficult for me.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.367
I wash my hands so thoroughly and then
I find it so hard to get out again

17:44.433 --> 17:45.834
without touching the doorknob.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.400
-Don't--
-Be too long!

17:51.033 --> 17:53.100
Rose, that is a happy woman in there.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.967
Now, I want you to promise
that you will not say anything.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.533
Do you promise?

17:58.467 --> 17:59.867
Do you promise?

18:02.300 --> 18:03.367
Are you sure?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.166
Well, what's got me so sad...

18:09.033 --> 18:11.133
Ohh...

18:11.834 --> 18:13.400
Oh, I just...

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
I just never, never had
two better friends.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.100
I just can't stand
the thought of leaving you.

18:26.233 --> 18:30.033
Oh, Blanche, you look gorgeous.
Shut up, Rose.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.967
-Are you ready?
-Yes, I guess.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.100
Stop!

18:34.700 --> 18:36.500
(thud)

18:40.133 --> 18:42.567
-The minister's here.
-Oh, I need perfume.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.834
Oh, perfume, perfume.
Come on, let's go.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.467
(knocking)

18:55.433 --> 18:59.233
-(chuckles) He's a half-hour late.
-He probably got caught in traffic.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.300
Ladies, I'm on a tight schedule.

19:01.367 --> 19:03.800
This is Miami.
I've got funerals backed up.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.767
Give us a few minutes, please.

19:07.834 --> 19:10.834
Five minutes more, then I've got to bury
Mr. Pinkus.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.867
-(doorbell rings)
-You see?

19:14.066 --> 19:17.567
-Is there a Blanche Hollingsworth here?
-My God, he's been killed.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.900
-Arrested.
-What?

19:19.233 --> 19:21.900
He gave me this to give to you.
He's a bigamist, ma'am.

19:21.967 --> 19:24.567
He's wanted in four states.
He's got six wives.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.333
You got yourself mixed up
with a real hustler.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.934
I'm sorry.

19:31.066 --> 19:34.200
Well, you won't be needing me today.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.734
Blanche, do you want to read the note?

19:42.834 --> 19:44.567
Do you want me to read it to you?

19:51.000 --> 19:55.934
"Dear Blanche, I guess you know by now.
I'm really sorry.

19:56.767 --> 19:58.767
"The thing is, I really liked you.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.934
"This time was different.
You're a special lady.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.934
"Maybe someday you'll write to me.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.100
-"Harry."
-Oh, God.

20:12.967 --> 20:16.300
-I'm stunned. I'm just stunned.
-I know.

20:17.367 --> 20:20.300
Oh, I feel like such an old fool.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.533
Not just a fool, but an old fool.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.433
My God, I just wanna die.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.667
You're not a fool, Blanche.

20:30.967 --> 20:33.900
You're a beautiful,
loving, trusting woman.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.800
There's no fool here, Blanche.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.800
I guess maybe I'm hoping the shock
will be too much for my heart

20:38.867 --> 20:40.533
and I'll just drop dead right here...

20:40.967 --> 20:43.433
and the minister can bury me
with Mr. Pinkus.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.834
I won't have to look anyone
in the eye ever again.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.200
Except maybe Mr. Pinkus.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.467
If I meet our paperboy,
he will not live to be a paper man.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.200
Florida is having a drought.

21:09.767 --> 21:10.800
In the entire state,

21:10.867 --> 21:13.266
there is not enough water
to make a cup of tea.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.700
He finds a puddle.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.767
What are you doing? She's sleeping.

21:27.867 --> 21:29.066
Just checking.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.834
You never know. Tell me, how is Blanche?

21:33.700 --> 21:35.300
She didn't go to work again today.

21:35.367 --> 21:38.567
It's been three weeks,
and she just sits in her room.

21:38.633 --> 21:42.133
-The museum's gonna fire her.
-Well, we've tried everything...

21:42.200 --> 21:43.934
golf, the movies, theater tickets.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.333
She wouldn't even budge
for Julio Iglesias.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.834
-I know grief. It takes time.
-Please, Rose.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.400
Listen, if you're Irish,
you have a wake.

21:52.467 --> 21:56.000
You eat, you cry, you drink,
you vomit and you're done.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.266
If you're Jewish, you cry, you sit,

22:00.333 --> 22:03.900
you eat for 7 days,
you put on 10 pounds and it's over.

22:05.633 --> 22:10.200
We Italians scream, dress up a donkey,
hire a band and that's that.

22:11.233 --> 22:14.934
It's these Southern protestants
who make it a way of life.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.867
When I go, put me in a steel sack

22:19.934 --> 22:22.433
and leave me on the curb
next to the cans.

22:23.567 --> 22:26.100
-We thought you were asleep.
-You never know.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.066
You girls shouldn't sit
out here in the sun.

22:34.567 --> 22:37.567
-Blanche, we've been so worried about you.
-I know.

22:37.633 --> 22:40.767
-Oh, I'm so glad you're up.
-I'm sorry if I worried you.

22:40.834 --> 22:44.900
-Aw, sweetheart, how are you?
-I'm ok. I really am.

22:44.967 --> 22:48.400
No. At first I wanted to give up,
to die, truly.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.166
Only time I ever felt worse
was when George died...

22:51.467 --> 22:54.133
but then I had the kids with me,
and I pulled through it.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.600
This time, I thought,
well, this is my last chance.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.266
This is my last hope for happiness.
I just thought I'd never feel good again.

23:00.333 --> 23:03.400
How long is this story?
I'm 80. I have to plan.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.533
Then this morning I woke up
and I was in the shower,

23:08.600 --> 23:10.834
shampooing my hair,
and I heard humming.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.900
Well, I thought there was
someone in there with me.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.000
No, it was me. I was humming.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.166
And humming means I'm feeling good.

23:17.500 --> 23:22.033
And then I realized I was
feeling good because of you.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.967
You made the difference.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.700
You're my family...

23:27.333 --> 23:29.300
and you make me happy to be alive.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.400
Let's all drive
to coconut grove for lunch.

23:34.467 --> 23:35.467
Ok.

23:35.533 --> 23:37.500
My treat. We have to celebrate.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.633
What, that she came out of her room?

23:41.033 --> 23:42.467
That we're together.

23:42.767 --> 23:45.767
And that no matter what happens,
even if we all get married,

23:45.834 --> 23:47.166
we'll stick together.

23:47.567 --> 23:49.734
Then we'll need
a much bigger house.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.333
Sure, Rose. After lunch,
you can pick up the lumber.

23:52.934 --> 23:54.567
Ma, you want to join us?

23:54.633 --> 23:57.934
Nope. I gotta rest.
I got a date tonight.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.166
Ah? With whom?

23:59.233 --> 24:02.700
The fancy man and I
are going to the dog track.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.467
-Your mother bets?
-No, she rides.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.100
She's a dog jockey. Let's go.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.367
Ohh...
