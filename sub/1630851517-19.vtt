00:01.334 --> 00:04.537
{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:01.334 --> 00:04.537
Whatever it is,

00:04.604 --> 00:07.240
I'm here for you.

00:07.307 --> 00:10.343
I got a girl pregnant.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.151
Oh, no.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.252
I messed up.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.253
Oh, no.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.187
What do I do?

00:21.254 --> 00:22.756
Oh, no.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.591
Please, say anything else.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.126
I'm trying!

00:26.192 --> 00:27.394
{\an1}Okay...

00:28.294 --> 00:29.262
Are you sure she's pregnant?

00:29.329 --> 00:30.630
Yes, she took a test.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.032
Sometimes those things
are wrong.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.467
She took more than one.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.102
Well...

00:36.870 --> 00:38.071
Are you sure it's yours?

00:38.138 --> 00:40.440
Some gals like to get around.

00:40.507 --> 00:44.210
Dad, she's pregnant,
it's mine and she's having it.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.813
Y'all are too young

00:44.944 --> 00:46.813
to have a baby!

00:46.880 --> 00:51.284
I am. She's actually 29.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.653

You realize you have to
tell your mother.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.241
{\an8}Well, I just told you.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.776
{\an8}Maybe we let it sit awhile.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.345
{\an8}(stammers) I can't know this
and keep it to myself.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.247
Dale did. Like a champ.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.550
(scoffs) Georgie,
you have to tell her.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.286
{\an8}Fine.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.155
{\an8}Will you at least be there?

01:31.391 --> 01:33.259
{\an8}Yeah.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.527
And tell her?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.865
What's going on?
Everything okay?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.100
You might want to sit.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.136
Now you're scaring me.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.370
No one died.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.272
Kind of the opposite, actually.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.542
Tell me.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.447
Um...

01:55.748 --> 01:57.851
I-I'm gonna...

02:00.820 --> 02:02.622
I'm gonna have a baby.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.461
{\an8}Are you kidding me?!

02:05.291 --> 02:08.461
{\an7}It's true.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.665
Okay, now I do need to sit.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.451
What are you doing?

02:31.518 --> 02:33.720
It felt weird coming in
without being invited.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.289
That's because everything
you do is weird.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.524
Where's Mom and Dad?

02:37.590 --> 02:38.324
I don't know.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.926
I just got home
and no one's here.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.827
You sure?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.695
It's a tiny house
and Dad's a big guy.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.564
Thanks for the heads-up.

02:44.631 --> 02:45.899
Where are you going?

02:45.965 --> 02:47.467
{\an8}To watch R-rated movies

02:47.534 --> 02:49.369
{\an8}until they get back, doy.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.504
{\an3}What do we even
know about this girl?

02:51.571 --> 02:53.172
Well, that's the thing...

02:53.239 --> 02:54.374
Buckle up.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.842
She's 29.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.778
{\an3}Years old?!
Oh, my...

02:58.845 --> 03:00.213
Guess we're standing again.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.682
What kind of 29-year-old

03:02.749 --> 03:03.917
dates someone your age?!

03:03.983 --> 03:06.319
Obviously the kind
that was lied to.

03:08.621 --> 03:09.656
What are we gonna do?

03:09.722 --> 03:11.424
That's what we're figuring out.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.793
You're gonna have to marry her.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.395
I think so, too.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.196
Hell no!

03:17.263 --> 03:18.364
{\an8}What do you mean, "no"?

03:18.431 --> 03:19.599
{\an8}He got her pregnant!

03:19.666 --> 03:21.467
Mary, she's 29.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.503
Well, what choice does he have?

03:23.570 --> 03:24.737
She's not gonna marry him.

03:24.804 --> 03:25.772
What's wrong with me?

03:25.838 --> 03:27.373
{\an8}You're an idiot.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.508
{\an8}You're irresponsible.
You live in a garage

03:28.575 --> 03:30.410
{\an8}and use a sink as a toilet!

03:30.476 --> 03:31.411
{\an8}Care to jump in?

03:31.477 --> 03:32.378
(knocking)

03:32.445 --> 03:33.713
SHELDON:
Hello?

03:35.481 --> 03:37.283
{\an3}Yeah, baby?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.352
SHELDON: I was just wondering
where everyone was.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.854
{\an9}Uh, we're just
in here talking.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.256
{\an9}We'll be out in
a little bit.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.224
{\an8}Everything okay?

03:43.323 --> 03:45.224
{\an8}SHELDON: I'm fine.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.660
{\an8}But Missy's watching
a movie called <i> Porky's.</i>

03:48.595 --> 03:49.629
I don't know
what that is.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.297
{\an5}That one's rough.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.297
Not good.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.765
I'll be right
back in, baby.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.000
SHELDON:
Hmm.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.704
You're gonna have to
introduce us to this girl.

03:57.770 --> 03:58.972
Why?

03:59.038 --> 03:59.872
'Cause she's having
our grandbaby,

03:59.939 --> 04:00.540
you dumb son of a bitch.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.842
George!
But what he said.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.646
{\an8}I'll ask her, but she's not
very happy with me right now.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.015
Yeah, I like her already.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.820
{\an8}(grunts softly)

04:40.079 --> 04:41.648
(crickets chirping)

04:45.118 --> 04:47.887
Relax, you earned this one.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.289
(exhales)
Thank you.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.958
(door closes)

04:52.025 --> 04:54.427
You coming back to bed?

04:55.428 --> 04:56.562
In a minute.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.437
{\an9}(sighs)

05:07.006 --> 05:08.975
Kind of déjà vu, huh?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.510
Kind of.

05:12.612 --> 05:16.449
I wanna be furious at him,
but how can I?

05:16.516 --> 05:20.553
The trick is to forget we did
the same thing, then it's easy.

05:22.655 --> 05:27.694
{\an1}At the time, it seemed
like our lives were over, but...

05:27.760 --> 05:30.430
then Georgie was born.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.964
{\an3}With that crazy
head of hair.

05:32.031 --> 05:37.637
{\an1}(laughs)
And just like that it was

05:37.704 --> 05:40.807
{\an1}the best thing that
could have happened to us.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.711
What kind of cigarette
are you smoking there?

05:48.514 --> 05:52.351
Oh, so, what do we do now?

05:52.418 --> 05:55.088
We don't have a lot of choices.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.357
We're gonna
be grandparents and, uh...

05:58.424 --> 06:00.359
What's the girl's name again?

06:00.426 --> 06:01.661
Mandy.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.629
And Mandy is gonna be
part of our lives

06:03.696 --> 06:08.367
in some shape or form
until we're, you know, dead.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.636
What do you mean,
"shape or form"?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.505
Georgie's gotta marry her.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.841
No, Mary, he doesn't.

06:14.907 --> 06:18.778
How am I supposed to set foot
in my church

06:18.845 --> 06:21.447
if our son has a child
out of wedlock?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.516
It's nobody's business.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.852
It's a small town, George,

06:25.918 --> 06:28.821
everything is
everybody's business.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.057
You ever stop to think
maybe she doesn't

06:31.124 --> 06:33.392
want to marry a 17-year-old?

06:34.026 --> 06:35.695
He'll be 18 in March.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.430
All right,
you're just being ridiculous.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.399
I'm being a Christian.

06:52.812 --> 06:55.581
When you were born, you were a
gift from God but that does not

06:55.648 --> 06:58.151
change the fact
that I am very mad at you!

07:00.119 --> 07:01.087
(door opens)

07:01.154 --> 07:01.854
{\an5}All right.

07:01.154 --> 07:01.854
(door slams)

07:10.129 --> 07:12.899
{\an5}You look like crap.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.899
{\an1}Thanks.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.501
{\an5}You go out drinking last night?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.501
Of course not.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.136
'Cause when I look that bad,

07:17.203 --> 07:19.005
I been out drinkin'.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.174
I just didn't get much sleep.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.976
Oh? Something bothering you?

07:25.077 --> 07:27.013
Well...

07:27.079 --> 07:29.515
there are some things

07:29.582 --> 07:31.083
going on that are...

07:32.718 --> 07:34.887
{\an5}...of concern.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.887
Morning.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.523
{\an6}Morning.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.523
Good morning.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.961
Everything okay?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.663
{\an6}Yeah.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.663
{\an1}You bet.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.499
Don't seem like it.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.502
Well, it is.
Go get ready for school.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.641
Carry on.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.143
(sighs)

07:57.210 --> 08:00.246
Before I say anything,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.181
I owe you an apology.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.483
Love 'em, hit me.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.853
I was just thinking
about the hell

08:06.919 --> 08:08.087
I put you through when...

08:08.154 --> 08:09.989
SHELDON: Mom, have you seen
my Thursday socks? I looked in

08:10.056 --> 08:12.091
my drawer and I could only
find Wednesday and Friday.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.160
Thursday's are in the dryer.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.561
Mm.

08:23.569 --> 08:27.139
Oh. Here's the little rascals.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.812
You were saying?

08:32.879 --> 08:34.914
I was just thinking about

08:34.981 --> 08:37.549
when I was pregnant
with Georgie, and...

08:37.616 --> 08:39.986
how hard that
must've been for you.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.254
I'm sorry.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.522
Georgie got that girl pregnant?

08:43.589 --> 08:45.925
Keep your voice down.
And... yes.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.627
Oh...

08:51.330 --> 08:52.965
Something weird's going on.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.767
If you mean my missing socks,

08:54.834 --> 08:56.969
they were in the dryer
clinging to Dad's boxer shorts.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.205
I mean with Mom.
When I was in the kitchen,

08:59.272 --> 09:00.973
she and Meemaw got real quiet.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.209
I was just in there and they
seemed perfectly normal.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.810
And what about last night?

09:04.877 --> 09:05.978
What about it?

09:06.045 --> 09:06.979
They were talking in the garage

09:07.046 --> 09:07.980
with the door shut.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.282
What's odd about that?

09:09.348 --> 09:11.117
Nobody in this house talks.

09:11.183 --> 09:14.287
Hmm. What do you think
is going on?

09:14.353 --> 09:16.155
I don't know,
but I'm telling you, it's bad.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.124
Not necessarily.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.293
Maybe they're planning
a surprise party for us.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.561
Our birthday isn't for months.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.197
True. Maybe they
needed some lead time.

09:25.264 --> 09:28.167
You can't expect Stephen Hawking
to roll in at a moment's notice.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.303
(knocking on door)

09:30.369 --> 09:33.906
Come on, I'm taking you both
to school. Let's move it.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.575
He looks terrible.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.577
He has had heart problems,

09:38.644 --> 09:40.579
plus he's been having
a rough time at work.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.715
Not to mention
he's pretty chunky.

09:42.782 --> 09:47.253
Oh, dear. I wonder if RadioShack
makes a defibrillator.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.291
That girl is like
ten years older than him.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.260
Because he lied to her.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.996
I told him from the start
that he needed to come clean,

09:57.063 --> 09:58.197
and be honest.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.198
(door opens)

09:59.265 --> 10:00.633
Morning.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.003
I know everything.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.604
Dang it.

10:05.671 --> 10:06.806
Why'd you have to tell her?

10:06.872 --> 10:08.274
She is my mother, and...

10:08.341 --> 10:09.976
Taking the kids to school.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.044
{\an4}Bye.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.044
Have a good day.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.151
{\an5}I see it now.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.151
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.020
Okay, in my defense...

10:21.087 --> 10:23.022
{\an1}You have no defense.
You're an idiot.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.091
That was a big part
of my defense.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.926
When do we get to
sit down with her

10:26.993 --> 10:28.194
and talk this through?

10:28.260 --> 10:31.864
Ah, yeah, here's
the thing about that:

10:31.931 --> 10:33.899
she ain't real eager
to meet y'all.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.835
Why not?

10:35.901 --> 10:38.371
Did you want to meet George's
parents when he knocked you up?

10:38.437 --> 10:41.340
I was not "knocked up,"
I was with child.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.875
And he's right there.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.946
♪ ♪

10:47.913 --> 10:49.749
(radio playing quietly)

10:54.854 --> 10:57.156
{\an6}What?

10:54.854 --> 10:57.156
Nothing.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.194
I love you.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.032
Okay.

11:06.899 --> 11:10.036
{\an1}In case it's not apparent,
she was speaking for both of us.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.340
Okay.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.446
{\an5}Ah, damn it.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.446
I'm not here to fight with you,

11:20.513 --> 11:24.984
or pass judgment on you,
I just want to talk about...

11:25.051 --> 11:27.787
where we're going with all this.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.455
There's nothing to talk about.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.258
{\an5}All this is my business.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.258
That's true.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.326
I just thought it might
be nice if you got

11:34.393 --> 11:36.095
to meet Georgie's family.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.098
I haven't even told
my own parents yet.

11:41.934 --> 11:45.871
Just so you know,
I went through this very thing

11:45.938 --> 11:49.175
with my own daughter,
Georgie's mom.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.710
So, we get it.

11:52.812 --> 11:53.879
Really?

11:53.946 --> 11:56.248
We just want to be helpful.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.453
Well, I'm not very happy
with Georgie right now.

12:00.519 --> 12:04.290
Nobody is. We get it.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.326
MARY: <i> Thanks, Brenda,</i>
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

12:07.393 --> 12:12.431
Oh, nothing major, just, um,
some family stuff that we need

12:12.498 --> 12:16.035
to talk about and it'd be better
if the kids weren't here.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.505
Great, I'll send 'em
over at 6:00?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.774
Okay.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.442
{\an5}Where are we going?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.442
{\an1}(gasps)

12:23.509 --> 12:26.045
Don't be sneaking up on me.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.280
I wasn't sneaking.
Where are we going?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.851
Brenda invited you
and your brother over

12:31.917 --> 12:33.319
to dinner with Billy tonight.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.955
{\an5}Why?

12:33.385 --> 12:35.955
Because they're nice people!

12:36.021 --> 12:38.324
Wow. Take a pill.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.525
(scoffs)

12:43.562 --> 12:45.931
{\an1}I don't see why
I got to wear a tie.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.200
Because we want to make
a good impression.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.503
She already met this bozo,
aren't we past that?

12:50.569 --> 12:53.272
Hey, let's just keep in mind,
I didn't do this by myself.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.473
It takes two to tango.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.809
Do you even know
what a tango is?

12:56.876 --> 12:58.444
It's sex, ain't it?

13:00.913 --> 13:02.915
(sighs) Pastor Jeff
is right next door.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.817
{\an3}Maybe I should invite
him to join us.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.085
Why?

13:06.152 --> 13:08.554
{\an1}So we can bring God
into the conversation.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.856
God let her get pregnant.
I think He's done enough.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.958
(doorbell rings)

13:13.025 --> 13:14.393
Okay, that's her.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.196
Um, everybody, let's make her
feel welcome.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.266
{\an5}Welcome.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.266
Hello.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.169
Yo.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.911
So, Mandy, what do you do?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.312
{\an3}Right now I'm just
waiting tables.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.080
Well, people need to eat.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.417
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.417
Mm-hmm.

13:39.885 --> 13:44.456
{\an3}You know what I enjoy?
That T-G-I-F Friday.

13:44.523 --> 13:47.927
They got a whole menu page,
just appetizers.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.462
I hope brisket's okay.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.499
Georgie wasn't too sure
what kind of food you liked.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.534
We didn't do a lot of eating
when we were together.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.972
So, Mandy,
your people from around here?

14:00.039 --> 14:02.007
Uh, Oklahoma originally.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.410
Well, we won't hold it
against you.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.045
{\an3}(laughs)

14:07.413 --> 14:09.415
I guess we don't even know
your last name.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.051
{\an5}McAllister.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.051
Scottish, right?

14:12.117 --> 14:13.519
{\an1}Right.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.955
'Cause if it was Irish,
it'd be O'McAllister.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.390
So, you're Catholic?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.626
I'm not really anything.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.895
{\an3}But you'll be
raising this child

14:22.962 --> 14:24.563
{\an3}with some sort of
religious upbringing.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.067
{\an3}(chuckles) I haven't
really thought about it.

14:28.133 --> 14:31.170
Well, that's one of the
things we can help with,

14:31.237 --> 14:32.404
starting with grace.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.473
{\an5}Mom...

14:32.471 --> 14:34.473
We're starting with grace!

14:42.114 --> 14:43.382
Heavenly Father...

14:43.449 --> 14:46.452
{\an5}Why not heavenly mother?

14:43.449 --> 14:46.452
Don't, just don't.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.320
Heavenly Father,

14:48.387 --> 14:50.923
bless this food and the
hands that prepared it.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.326
{\an3}And thank you for bringing
Mandy into our family

14:54.393 --> 14:57.363
{\an3}and watch over this child
as he or she grows

14:57.429 --> 15:00.065
and becomes a God-fearin'
Baptist, amen.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.634
Amen.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.202
{\an3}Smooth.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.504
You like meatloaf?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.006
Yeah, is that what we're having?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.074
No, just making
dinner conversation.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.076
We're having spaghetti.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.611
With hot dogs
cut up in it?

15:12.678 --> 15:14.213
Ew, no.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.681
I'd like to go home, please.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.082
We can't.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.017
How come?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.085
Yeah, how come?

15:20.152 --> 15:21.320
We don't know.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.088
{\an1}The leading theory
is my father's dying.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.523
I don't think that's it.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.292
Well, something's wrong.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.394
Maybe they're getting
divorced like my mom and dad.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.462
Billy! We don't talk about that.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.198
Never mind.

15:39.171 --> 15:42.308
So, Mandy,
my mother mentioned that

15:42.374 --> 15:45.077
your folks don't know
about the baby.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.645
No, not yet.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.081
Well, I'm sure
they'll be excited

15:49.148 --> 15:50.316
when you tell them
you're bringing

15:50.382 --> 15:52.084
new life into the world.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.520
Is that how you felt
when she got pregnant?

15:54.586 --> 15:56.155
About the baby?

15:56.221 --> 15:59.692
{\an3}Yeah. The guy who did it?
(blows raspberry)

15:59.758 --> 16:01.126
Mutual.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.062
They kid around like that.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.065
Yeah, all good fun.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.701
MARY: Well, regardless of what
goes on with your parents,

16:08.767 --> 16:11.270
we want you to know
that we are here for you

16:11.337 --> 16:14.106
and the baby, who we will
love and cherish.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.175
Thank you.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.277
{\an1}Me, too.
In fact, if you want,

16:18.344 --> 16:20.045
{\an1}I can go with you
to tell your parents.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.680
{\an3}Yeah, and then my father
can shoot you.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.048
{\an1}(laughing)

16:23.115 --> 16:24.550
I'm not kidding.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.319
{\an3}Maybe it would be better
if you went to your parents

16:27.386 --> 16:30.322
with, um, good news first.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.624
{\an5}And what would that be?

16:30.389 --> 16:32.624
{\an3}Well...

16:32.691 --> 16:35.094
everybody loves a wedding.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.428
Would you stop with that?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.164
{\an5}It needs to be discussed.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.164
No, it doesn't.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.033
I'm having a baby, I don't
need to marry another one.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.369
I know I'm young now,
but think about it--

16:43.435 --> 16:47.373
when you're a dried-up old lady,
I'll be your hot trophy husband.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.242
{\an3}Maybe her dad should
put you down.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.077
{\an3}MARY:
I just think that

16:52.144 --> 16:56.048
God wants children raised within
the bonds of holy matrimony.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.783
Mary, they already
made one giant mistake,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.551
they don't have to make another.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.223
So, marrying me was a mistake?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.459
I'm not talking about us,
I'm talking about them.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.762
{\an3}I think we all know who
you're talking about.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.597
You really want
to do this now?

17:11.663 --> 17:13.332
You're honestly happy
with how your life turned out?

17:13.398 --> 17:14.465
You have no regrets?

17:14.532 --> 17:16.402
That "giant mistake" gave us

17:16.468 --> 17:18.404
our children
who I love very much.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.672
{\an5}What about your husband?

17:18.470 --> 17:20.672
Oh, I love him just fine!

17:20.739 --> 17:22.708
Oh, nice, put that
on a Hallmark card.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.242
What do you want me to say?

17:24.309 --> 17:25.511
I want you to admit
that this marriage

17:25.577 --> 17:27.378
hasn't exactly
been a bed of roses.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.082
{\an1}Wake up, no marriage
is a bed of roses!

17:30.149 --> 17:32.818
{\an5}Well, then I guess we nailed it!

17:30.149 --> 17:32.818
I guess we did!

17:32.885 --> 17:35.087
And that kid is
gonna be Baptist!

17:36.755 --> 17:39.691
So, Mandy, glad you came?

17:42.161 --> 17:43.762
{\an3}Makes perfect sense,
they're getting divorced.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.497
{\an1}If they do,
I'm staying with Mom.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.266
That's fine, I'll take Dad.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.301
And if he does die, you'll get
the house to yourself.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.702
You can live with us.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.805
{\an3}Nobody's dying,
nobody's getting divorced.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.239
Except you and Dad.

17:54.306 --> 17:55.574
Just eat your dinner.

17:55.641 --> 17:56.809
I wonder if our dad
met another woman.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.847
Nobody met nobody.
You eat your dinner, too.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.249
My dad's with another woman.
She's nice.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.151
Dinner!

18:06.218 --> 18:07.753
Which would be perfect with
little chunks of hot dog in it.

18:08.654 --> 18:09.788
Her name is Martha Jean.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.223
{\an3}Billy!

18:12.758 --> 18:15.194
(whispers):
She works at a tanning salon.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.296
Thanks for coming.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.133
Yeah, it was great.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.303
Okay, so, I'll talk to you?

18:24.369 --> 18:26.371
I guess.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.841
What are you doing?

18:28.907 --> 18:30.576
Giving you a kiss good night.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.678
I think you've given me enough.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.280
Hey. Mandy, hold up.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.648
Go away.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.890
{\an3}Sorry about all
the yelling.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.492
Are they always like that?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.494
Not in front of company.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.562
So, it's kind of like you're
already family.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.631
{\an5}Lucky me.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.631
{\an3}Mm.

18:53.699 --> 18:57.402
Speaking of which, when
are you gonna tell your folks?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.305
I was thinking about
waiting until my mom

19:00.372 --> 19:01.773
tells me to lay off the pie.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.742
Well, just remember,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.744
if you ever need anything,
call me.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.347
I've already been
through this with my daughter,

19:08.413 --> 19:10.315
so I know how to do it wrong.
