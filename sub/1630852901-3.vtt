00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.458


01:13.125 --> 01:16.041
Let me get this straight.
You expect me to believe

01:16.125 --> 01:20.833
that you "sleep-ate" an entire container
of ice cream without waking up?

01:21.333 --> 01:23.333
You expect me to believe you did.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.458
And just who sleep-eats with a spoon?

01:26.541 --> 01:28.083
People with manners.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.333
You're nothing but a common thief!

01:31.083 --> 01:33.291
-You're the thief!
-No, you are!

01:33.375 --> 01:39.291
-No, you! No, you!
-No, you! No, you!

01:39.375 --> 01:40.416
Enough!

01:41.208 --> 01:43.291
You boys are family.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.833
No use getting bent out of shape
about little stuff.

01:46.916 --> 01:50.000
Just let it be water under the bridge.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.875
Now, here's five bucks.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.708
And some pocket lint.

01:54.791 --> 01:59.000
Go do something fun together.
You two are brothers.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.458
Why does he always get the five bucks?!

02:01.541 --> 02:04.083
And why does he always get
the pocket lint?

02:04.166 --> 02:05.458
No, you do!

02:05.541 --> 02:09.583
-No, you! No, you!
-No, you! No, you!

02:09.666 --> 02:11.000
Out!

02:12.583 --> 02:16.000
I say we just take the money
and buy some more ice cream.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.958
Look, if we invest it,

02:18.041 --> 02:20.750
we could have as much ice cream
as we want when we're older.

02:20.833 --> 02:23.083
But I want ice cream now!

02:23.166 --> 02:26.208
-You don't have to be such a--

02:28.875 --> 02:32.958
Head right up, folks. We cast off
in a few minutes. Get on the boat.

02:33.041 --> 02:37.291
Hey, hey! Looks like we got
a couple of VIPs on our hands.

02:37.375 --> 02:40.208
Youse two want
the premium treatment, don't yas?

02:40.291 --> 02:42.291
Huh? Huh? Huh?

02:43.541 --> 02:45.041
What's with those gloves?

02:45.125 --> 02:48.166
-Ho-oh, we used to be pro boxers.
-Champions!

02:48.250 --> 02:52.041
But, our dear old ma,
she hated when we pounded each other.

02:52.125 --> 02:55.458
So we opened this club!
We're respectable types now.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.875
Anybody says different, I'll pound 'em!

02:57.958 --> 03:00.875
Ha-ha! Croaks is just kidding!
Check this out!

03:00.958 --> 03:02.791
Want an evening you'll never forget?

03:02.875 --> 03:04.875
We got first-class entertainments,

03:04.958 --> 03:06.166
ballroom dancing,

03:06.250 --> 03:07.708
and fine dining.

03:10.666 --> 03:12.000
Mugsy, look!

03:12.583 --> 03:14.666
"Free ice cream with entry."

03:14.750 --> 03:16.375
Ice cream!

03:17.583 --> 03:19.000
Not so fast!

03:21.375 --> 03:23.250
Cover charge is 20 bucks.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.750
We don't have that much.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.000
Hmm… Well, how much you got?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.375
Five bucks and some pocket lint.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.125
You know what $5 gets you?

03:34.208 --> 03:35.833
Ice cream?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.291
A kick in the pants!

03:42.083 --> 03:44.791
Did you see how far
I kicked that little punk?

03:44.875 --> 03:47.708
-You saying you better than me?
-So what if I am?

03:51.375 --> 03:54.458
Oh! Hello, Mr. Mayor., Mrs. Mr. Mayor.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.000
We're respectable types.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.750
-Say any different and I'll pound you!
-Oh!

03:58.833 --> 04:01.250
This guy! Always with the jokes!

04:01.333 --> 04:03.958
Please, step right inside.

04:04.041 --> 04:04.875
Hmph!

04:11.083 --> 04:12.416
This is an outrage!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.083
They stole our five bucks.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.500
-They kicked us in the river!
-The lint!

04:23.666 --> 04:24.666
Ice cream.

04:24.750 --> 04:25.833
I smell ice cream!

04:35.583 --> 04:38.333
Ooh… It's right under that vent.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.416
Look!

04:44.875 --> 04:46.750
-We're shoving off!
-Let's go!

04:49.250 --> 04:51.750
Oh, hey! How youse doing, huh?

04:51.833 --> 04:55.291
Looking good. Watch out for this guy.
Here comes trouble.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.083
You sure this is right?

04:57.166 --> 04:59.291
Shh, quiet! Someone might hear!

04:59.375 --> 05:01.666
Hey! How'd you bozos get in?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.458
-Just kidding…

05:05.541 --> 05:06.583
Phew!

05:07.708 --> 05:11.541
You fine folks are paying customers.
You ain't bozos.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.041
Except for this clown.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.583
But seriously, folks,

05:18.666 --> 05:21.375
we'd like to start
the night off with a song.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.791
-You're stepping on my fingers!
-Watch it!

06:14.708 --> 06:16.416
We miss youse, Ma!

06:18.208 --> 06:20.583
Hey-o! Who's up there?

06:20.666 --> 06:22.333

06:27.833 --> 06:30.166
Oh! Ow!, Hot, hot, hot! Ow!

06:36.916 --> 06:38.333
Ma's on fire!

06:38.416 --> 06:41.125
-You saying it's my fault?
-So what if I am?

06:44.958 --> 06:47.041
All part of the show, folks.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.375
Hey, you. Put out Ma.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.000
Make with the music.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.458
- Sherman!

07:11.833 --> 07:13.791
Dorris? What are you doin' here?

07:13.875 --> 07:17.416
You stood me up again!
You're always workin'!

07:17.500 --> 07:20.125
Aw, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.666
No more excuses!

07:21.750 --> 07:26.750
You missed my parents' "anniversiary."
You missed our "anniversiary!"

07:26.833 --> 07:29.916
Anniversary! It's "anniversary"!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.708
-That's what I said.
-No.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.541
You said "anniversiary."
And you said it twice.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.833
It's the only reason I brought it up.

07:36.916 --> 07:37.750
Oh!

07:37.833 --> 07:41.000
Here he goes again. Correctin' me!

07:41.083 --> 07:43.333
This is why I don't tell you things.

07:43.416 --> 07:45.833
-Like how your meat's escapin'.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.916
Hey! It's right there.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.583
Now's our chance
to grab it and get outta here!

08:00.666 --> 08:01.666
Hey!

08:01.750 --> 08:03.833

08:03.916 --> 08:06.208

08:06.291 --> 08:07.541
-Come here!
-Whoa!

08:10.458 --> 08:12.541
Get back here, you little creeps!

08:14.875 --> 08:18.750
Hello, Mr. Mayor. Push in your chair?
How about a picture? Cheese!

08:28.000 --> 08:28.833


08:29.916 --> 08:31.666
Cuphead! Cuphead! Cuphead!

08:33.166 --> 08:34.375

09:19.583 --> 09:22.500
All part of the show, folks.
All part of the show!

09:23.500 --> 09:26.500

Let's grab it and get outta here!

09:26.583 --> 09:27.416
Wait.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.666
I need to say something.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.875
I'm sorry, Cuphead.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.791
For sleep-eating my ice cream?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.291
I didn't sleep-eat it.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.583
I awake-ate it!

09:38.666 --> 09:41.458
I'm the worst brother ever!

09:41.541 --> 09:43.291
Hey! No, you're not.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.125
'Cause I awake-ate your ice cream too.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.041
You did?

09:47.125 --> 09:48.583
Aww!

09:51.333 --> 09:56.333
It's so beautiful how youse two
forgive each other like that. Oh!

09:56.416 --> 09:58.833
We should try to be more like that.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.875
I'm sorry we's always fighting.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.333
Me too.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.625
Youse two are family now.

10:04.708 --> 10:08.083
And with family,

10:16.708 --> 10:18.958
Our club! It's ruined!

10:19.041 --> 10:20.583
You saying it's my fault?

10:20.666 --> 10:21.708
So what if I am?

10:23.375 --> 10:29.583
Oh! Hello, Mr. Mayor., Mrs. Mr. Mayor.
I trust you had a wonderful evening.
