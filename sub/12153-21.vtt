00:31.400 --> 00:33.600
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.900
- Mmm. Hey.
- [Sighs, Laughs]

01:43.100 --> 01:47.700
Okay. Where did you learn
how to do that?

01:47.700 --> 01:51.000
- Which part?
- Doesn't matter.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.900
You're not perfectly happy,
are you?

01:55.900 --> 01:59.900
- 'Cause I got my wooden stake right here.
- [Groans]

01:59.900 --> 02:03.000
That's not a stake.
I know I brought it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.100
<i>- [Rifling]</i>
- You're safe.

02:05.100 --> 02:10.500
[Inhales]
Okay. And you? Good?

02:10.500 --> 02:14.500
You... weren't thinking about
your little Roman friend or...

02:14.700 --> 02:18.400
Nina, for the last...

02:18.400 --> 02:20.700
- Whoa.
- Wow. Hey.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.600
For the last... very long moment,
I haven't had a single coherent thought.

02:24.900 --> 02:28.400
- I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
- You really should.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.700
But now the brow is back.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.900
If she's not
on your mind, then...

02:33.900 --> 02:39.000
[Inhales] There's... There's a lot...
more than usual goin' on.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
- Work?
- Always.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
You should get away.
Vacation? You know that word?

02:46.200 --> 02:51.500
Go to Cabo, drink margaritas, midnight
skinny-dipping, making love on the beach...

02:51.500 --> 02:55.400
Did you catch how I subtly included myself
in your vacation package?

02:55.400 --> 02:57.400
Nina...

02:57.400 --> 02:59.700
Too pushy, too needy.
I never even said it.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.200
You should make love
on the beach all by yourself.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.700
- It would be wonderful. I mean it.
- But?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.400
[Sighs]
That there...

03:10.400 --> 03:15.600
There are things
that-that I have to do.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.400
Things I've already
set in motion that, uh...

03:18.400 --> 03:20.300
[Sighs, Groans]

03:23.200 --> 03:26.300
I know I spent years
fighting to get somewhere...

03:27.400 --> 03:30.900
to accomplish something...

03:30.900 --> 03:32.900
and now that
I'm close to it...

03:34.900 --> 03:38.300
I don't like what I see...
who I am.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.600
- You're a hero.
- Not that word.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.800
Well, you're my hero.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.800
I may not always be.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.900
<i>[Spike]</i>
<i>Like you're not even there.</i>

03:54.900 --> 03:58.400
World trembled
before your feet once.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.000
Now, paddin' around a place
you don't wanna be in...

04:02.000 --> 04:05.100
and the rabble don't even give you
so much as a polite yawn.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.200
Do not presume I require
any creature's attention.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.600
Wouldn't dream of it, Blue.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.400
Still, you can't enjoy
haunting this place.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.800
Less than what you were,
not knowing what to do with yourself.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.800
- Believe me, I've been there.
- And what do you know of it?

04:21.800 --> 04:25.800
Long and fascinating tale.
Ghost story, in fact.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.200
Short of it is,
take my advice.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.400
Get out once in a while
before you go bats.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.300
- Out?
- Out.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.600
Outside? That place
just on the other side of the window?

04:38.600 --> 04:43.200
I've grown wary of this world
since my powers were depleted.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.300
Strange. Though I've been made
more human...

04:46.300 --> 04:48.600
this place remains disconcerting.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.300
Yeah. Well, I'm afraid
that never goes away.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.100
Anyhow, I though Wesley
was giving you a primer on all things human.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.100
He and I are no longer
having intercourse.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.000
Yeah. L...
You what? What?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
He has ceased
communication with me.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.800
Oh. Oh.
Communi...

05:02.800 --> 05:06.700
My recent reversion
to the Burkle persona disturbed him...

05:06.700 --> 05:08.700
and he will not
tell me why.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
You don't know?

05:11.800 --> 05:15.800
You may not think you're as powerful
as you were, Highness...

05:15.800 --> 05:20.700
but looking like Fred,
for some of us...

05:20.700 --> 05:22.900
is the most devastating
power you have.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.200
<i>[Chattering]</i>

05:28.200 --> 05:30.600
<i>Ah. And there's</i>
<i>the man himself.</i>

05:30.600 --> 05:33.000
<i>Angel, I'd like you to meet</i>
<i>Senator Brucker.</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:35.400
Senator. Welcome
to Wolfram and Hart.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.500
I go way back with this firm.
Back when Holland Manners was in charge.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.600
You'll find things
have changed a bit since then.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.400
- Charles Gunn.
- Head of our Legal Department.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.300
- Oh. And this is Ernesto, my personal...
- Vampire.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.600
Aide. I always forget your kind
can sense each other.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.000
<i>Well, I believe in</i>
<i>diversity on my staff.</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
- It was a big part of my campaign.
- How commendable.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.400
- Harmony, you mind gettin' us some coffee?
- Coming up.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.700
Oh. Thank you, no.
No coffee.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.500
But if it isn't any trouble,
I think Ernesto might like some blood.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
Virgin, if you have it.
Room temperature's fine.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.400
<i>Sorry. We have</i>
<i>a "no human blood"policy.</i>

06:08.400 --> 06:12.800
I can offer you something in a rodent.
We have some fruity, unassuming vole...

06:12.800 --> 06:16.800
<i>I think we could make an exception</i>
<i>to our policy this time for the senator.</i>

06:17.000 --> 06:19.200
Couldn't we, Angel?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.400
Harmony, the lab might have something
in the blood bank.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.600
<i>- Why don't you go check it out?</i>
<i>- Okay. You're the boss, boss.</i>

06:26.300 --> 06:28.500
Could I maybe
just have a teeny-weeny...

06:28.500 --> 06:31.100
- No.
- Just thought I'd ask.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.000
Well, Senator, if there's anything you need,
please call on me.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.200
Rest assured,
you're in good hands.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.300
Shall we?

06:41.200 --> 06:45.500
<i>- Angel. There's been another fatality in Funville.</i>
- What?

06:45.500 --> 06:49.200
That abandoned amusement park downtown.
Third victim in as many nights.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.400
Teeth marks strongly indicate
a Boretz demon.

06:51.400 --> 06:56.100
Ah, bloody Boretz. Nasty buggers.
Stink to high heaven.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.800
Dress as transients to prey
on the homeless, poor sods.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.300
<i>[Wesley] This last victim</i>
<i>was a teenage girl. A runaway.</i>

07:02.300 --> 07:05.200
- She was ripped apart.
- There's not much we can do about it now, huh?

07:05.200 --> 07:08.000
Angel, we need to find
this demon and destroy it before...

07:08.000 --> 07:12.300
Somebody else dies?
Yeah, I know, Wes.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.200
People are dying
every day all over.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.000
- This girl's just one more statistic...
- Stacey.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.300
The statistic's name
was Stacey Bluth.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.500
Well, you know we can't save everybody,
and we can't sweat the small stuff.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
Small?

07:27.500 --> 07:29.400
Wes, I got a United States
senator waitin' for me...

07:29.400 --> 07:33.800
so just find out whatever you can about
this Boretz thing, and we'll talk later, okay?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.200
- "Small stuff."
<i>- Listen...</i>

07:40.200 --> 07:42.500
you need some Boretz killing
done, I'll have a go.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.600
I haven't had a decent tussle
since the blue meanie and I stopped sparring.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.300
<i>Yes. All right.</i>
<i>Call me if you find anything.</i>

07:48.300 --> 07:50.500
I'll be in my office,
learning what I can.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.800
He showed no regard
for my presence.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.500
Not that you require
any creature's attention.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.600
Hey, you wanna go
find somethin' to hit?

08:02.200 --> 08:05.100
[Man Narrating]
A Gulf War veteran and Bronze Star recipient...

08:05.100 --> 08:07.800
Mike Conley believes
ethics and integrity matter.

08:07.800 --> 08:13.100
Finding solutions to problems in our educational
system, health, and child care services.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.300
And Mike Conley believes
in work and in home.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.200
Your home is his work.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.200
He's looking out for your children's interests.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.500
There. So you can see my concern.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.600
This Conley campaign's
a juggernaut.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.300
Guy came out of nowhere with his
"Your home is his work" crap.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.900
- Women voters are eating it up.
- And they were mine.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.299
I had a lock on the chick vote,
and now my numbers are slipping.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.299
I didn't claw my way up from hell
and get installed in a human body...

08:38.299 --> 08:40.700
just to have some pedophile
steal my Senate seat.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.200
- Wait. He's a pedophile?
- Not yet.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.900
But the public better think he is
when you guys get through.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.100
- Pardon me?
<i>- Help convince Conley he is.</i>

08:48.100 --> 08:51.600
You've got some sort of brainwashing
capabilities here, don't you?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.700
- What's that doctor's name?
- Sparrow.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.800
That's the one.
This sounds right up his alley.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.200
Yeah, well, it's not up ours.
Look, I don't care what kind of services...

08:59.200 --> 09:02.700
you were used to getting with this firm,
but Holland Manners doesn't live here anymore.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.600
We're not about to ruin a man's life
and reputation just so you can...

09:05.600 --> 09:08.600
- We can do it.
- What?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
Not sure how long a reconditioning
like that would take.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.900
- The election's in November.
- You're not seriously considering...

09:12.900 --> 09:16.500
Angel, you just made yourself
a very loyal ally in Washington.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.300
- Angel, we need to talk.
- I'm with the senator now, Gunn.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.000
Boretz demons.
Classifications and case histories.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.800
What <i>am</i> I looking...

09:44.300 --> 09:46.600
We got a serious problem.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.700
- It's Angel. He's...
- Hold on.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.100
Wes?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.200
<i>[Grunting]</i>

09:59.900 --> 10:03.100
Aw, hell.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.000
Nice one.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.900
- Did I tell ya? Ran into Ed the other day.
- Ed?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.600
The grand potentate whatcha-whosit
of the Fell Brethren?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
Right.
How is Ed?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.100
You know the Fells.
All they can talk about is the baby.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.700
"The baby's doin' this now."
"The baby's doin' that."

10:18.700 --> 10:21.500
<i>"What a wonderful ritual sacrifiiice he'll make."</i>
<i>Yak, yak, yak.</i>

10:21.500 --> 10:23.800
Anyway, he couldn't say
enough nice things about you.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.500
- Oh, great.
- Hey, you're really comin' through, big guy.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.500
- There's a real buzz about you.
- So, how much longer do I
have to wait for an answer?

10:30.500 --> 10:33.900
Hey, these things take time.
Trust me. It won't be long now.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.100
See? This isn't so bad now.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.000
Little field trip
out in the...

10:48.000 --> 10:50.400
well, what passes
in this city for fresh air.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
All we need now is to bag ourselves
a Boretz demon...

10:54.700 --> 10:57.200
we got ourselves
a perfect date.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.200
[Illyria]
Angel does not think...

10:59.200 --> 11:02.600
the casualties of this creature
are important enough to avenge.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.500
I think corporate living's
made him lose his love for the hunt.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.600
No worries.
More for me then.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.700
[Illyria]
It does not serve his interest.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.200
What are you on about?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.200
I've seen this before
with many rulers.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.300
- Your leader has been corrupted.
<i>- Hey. Hang on.</i>

11:24.300 --> 11:26.600
In the first place,
Angel's not my leader.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.200
And in the second, what the bloody hell
do you mean, "corrupted"?

11:29.200 --> 11:32.100
It always begins the same.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.600
A ruler turns a blind eye to the dealings
or battles from which he cannot gain...

11:35.600 --> 11:38.800
<i>and a deaf ear to the counsel</i>
<i>of those closest to him.</i>

11:38.800 --> 11:42.400
As his strength increases, so does
the separation between him and his follow...

11:42.400 --> 11:44.700
Shh.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.900
- You smell that?
- The odors of everything in this world of men...

11:47.900 --> 11:50.200
are equally repugnant
to me.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.200
Bloody helpful.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.800
You're wrong about Angel.
[Sighs]

11:59.800 --> 12:02.900
Not that I don't think the sod could end up
being a megalomaniacal bastard...

12:02.900 --> 12:05.500
it's just if he did,
I'd know it.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
I'd feel it.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.700
[Illyria]
You'll have proof soon enough.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.100
A corrupted ruler
on such a path...

12:13.100 --> 12:16.000
sees treachery and betrayal
all around him.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.800
He cannot suffer intimates.
He will eventually turn against them.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.100
[Chuckles]
Guess I don't have to worry about that...

12:22.100 --> 12:24.600
'cause Angel and me
have never been intimate.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.300
- Except that one...
- Mark me.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.300
He will murder
one of you.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.500
<i>Actually...</i>

12:31.500 --> 12:33.900
he already has.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.200
Drogyn.

12:36.200 --> 12:40.000
- Who is this?
- The guardian of the Deeper Well.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.300
<i>- [Gasping]</i>
- Greenskeeper of your graveyard, so to speak.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.300
My jailer.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.200
- Illyria.
- Boretz.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
[Growling]

12:48.400 --> 12:50.500
[Grunts]

12:56.600 --> 12:58.800
Stay away from its mouth.
Its bite is poisonous.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.800
<i>Go for its knees.!</i>

13:00.800 --> 13:02.900
I think there's a weak spot...

13:04.200 --> 13:07.200
Okay. Yeah.
That might do it.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.900
Drogyn. What the hell
are you doing here?

13:12.900 --> 13:16.400
<i>Don't give me your "Ask me no questions,</i>
<i>I'll tell you no lies"bugaboo.</i>

13:16.400 --> 13:19.100
- I came to find you.
- Oh, so you tacked up a sign on your tree...

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
waved bye to the Keeblers,
hopped the puddle...

13:21.100 --> 13:23.500
and managed to sniff me out
in a city of ten million.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.500
I can find anyone
who's visited the well...

13:26.500 --> 13:28.700
be they in this world
or any other.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.700
- [Gasps] I came to... to warn you.
- Warn me?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.600
- He's bleeding.
- You're all torn up, mate.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.900
- [Gasping]
- What did this to you? The Boretz, was it?

13:38.900 --> 13:42.400
No.
It was Angel.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.900
<i>That'd look good</i>
<i>on a calf.</i>

14:06.900 --> 14:09.700
- Pardon?
- Thinking of getting a tattoo, right?

14:09.700 --> 14:14.200
Put a little more bad in your bad-boy bank.
It should go on your calf.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.900
Angel, something unusual
came across one of my...

14:20.900 --> 14:24.200
<i>Oh, I... didn't realize</i>
<i>you were occupied.</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:26.200
If you don't mind,
Hamilton...

14:26.200 --> 14:28.500
Actually, Wes, we're... kind of
in the middle of something.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.600
Why don't you try me later?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.100
- Yes. Later then.
- Hey, Wes?

14:38.800 --> 14:41.900
Shut the door
on your way out.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.500
Hey.
Is Angel in there?

14:45.500 --> 14:48.700
- He is.
- What's the weather report?

14:48.700 --> 14:52.100
Cold. Icy, actually.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.000
Well, he cut six of my clients loose.
Didn't even tell me.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.200
I spent all day talking them off ledges
and off of pill bottles.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.900
I sense that suicidal celebrities
are beneath Angel's concern.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.500
These are very pretty people
I'm talking about here, Wes.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.600
Four of'em getting in shape
for <i>Young Guns III.</i>

15:06.600 --> 15:08.700
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.800
He and Hamilton are in his office.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.000
- They're discussing business strategy.
- Hamilton?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.600
Looks like Angel suddenly started
channeling Leona Helmsley.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.900
- He's not himself, at any rate.
- What's happening to him?

15:18.900 --> 15:22.000
<i>- [Phone Rings]</i>
- Yes?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.900
Spike.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.000
It was a Sathari...

15:28.000 --> 15:30.300
part of a clan
of demon assassins.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.600
They fell upon me
last night.

15:32.600 --> 15:38.100
The poison from his four blades
wearing heavy on my limbs...

15:38.100 --> 15:41.100
Yeah. Rousing bit of rah-rah, mate.
Get to the goods.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.900
Once I bested him, I tortured
the Sathari for hours...

15:46.900 --> 15:49.600
until he confessed
who had sent him.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
It was Angel.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.500
Tell 'em why.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.700
He said Angel was afraid
I'd find something in the Deeper Well...

16:01.200 --> 16:04.000
something that would uncover
the truth about his involvement.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
- In what?
- Helping Illyria escape from her tomb.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.000
I thought the release of her sarcophagus
from the Deeper Well was predestined.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.200
- Yeah. What about that bit?
- That's what I thought at the time...

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
but now I believe...

16:21.200 --> 16:24.500
Illyria's resurrection
may have been planned.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.600
- By Angel.
- Oh, that doesn't make a lick of sense.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.500
Why would Angel
want to spring an Old One?

16:29.500 --> 16:32.900
- I don't think that was the point.
- Then what was?

16:32.900 --> 16:35.500
Before he died,
the assassin said something about a sacrifice.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.500
Someone... trusted and dear.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.400
Are you saying...

16:42.400 --> 16:45.300
that Angel was responsible for
what happened to Fred?

16:45.300 --> 16:48.100
I mean, he may not have...
chosen her specifically, but...

16:48.100 --> 16:51.400
<i>Whoa.! Let's put a kibosh on that sentence</i>
<i>before it turns into an ass-kickin'</i>

16:51.400 --> 16:53.800
Do you think
I gain pleasure in this?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.900
I held Angel an ally,
a brother.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.300
And you believe...
he may have murdered Fred.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.099
I know this is difficult
for you, but Angel was involved.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.300
The information
retrieved from the assassin...

17:09.300 --> 17:12.800
- You ever think he was lyin'?
- No one lies when they're
at the mercy of my wrath.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.400
- Then you're the liar, Aragorn.
- He has to tell the truth.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.099
- It's a curse or something.
- How can we be sure? We don't know this guy.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.200
Gunn, this is Drogyn
the Battlebrand...

17:20.200 --> 17:23.300
given eternal youth
a thousand years ago.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.700
Demon bane, truth-sayer...

17:25.700 --> 17:28.500
Watchers Council.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.400
Percy did a paper.
Bully for him.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.400
Drogyn, any idea
what this symbol means?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.900
- No.
- Where'd you get that?

17:38.900 --> 17:42.400
This afternoon, someone tapped
into the template interface...

17:42.400 --> 17:45.200
sent a message to me,
and that symbol.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.700
- Somebody's dropping clues.
- Playing games is more like it.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.800
Put me on the short bus, but I still can't
wrap my head around the notion...

17:50.800 --> 17:53.100
that Angel had anything
to do with Fred, or any of this.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.700
Angel's been doing a number of things
out of character lately.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.000
- We all noticed it.
- Yeah, but why is this happening now?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.900
Why the change?

18:00.900 --> 18:05.300
Yes, why the sudden need
to tie up loose ends like Drogyn?

18:05.300 --> 18:08.000
- Unless...
- He's preparing to make his move.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.400
What kind of move
we talking about?

18:10.400 --> 18:14.000
There's only one way
to find out. We ask him.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.500
- Drogyn should stay here, under guard.
- I'm not missing the fireworks.

18:19.500 --> 18:23.200
Hey, Illyria. You don't... care about
any of this nonsense, do you?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.600
The intricacies of your fates
are meaningless.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.900
Well and good. You mind watchin' over
our friend Drogyn?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.200
Aw, come on.
New place will do you good.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.100
It's nice and cozy.
Help yourself to some beer in the fridge.

18:34.100 --> 18:37.300
Switch on the telly
if you get bored, and, uh...

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
feel free to play a little
<i>Crash Bandicoot.</i>

Strike these four clauses and wire it back
to them. See what they make of that.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.300
- Yeah. See what they make of that.
- Angel?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.900
- Long dinner?
- We need to talk to you.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.000
- Now.
- Boy's dead serious.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.800
Are you comin' then?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.600
Okay, what's on your minds?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.600
- The question is, what's on yours?
- Our friend Drogyn's in town.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.500
- Is he?
- Yep. Bit marked up though.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.400
Somebody tried to have him killed.
Know anything about that?

19:29.400 --> 19:33.200
Of course not.
Where is he?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.400
- He's safe.
- Good.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.800
Now, can we get
back to business?

19:37.800 --> 19:39.900
Or was there something else?

19:39.900 --> 19:43.400
"Business." What "business"
are we in, Angel?

19:43.400 --> 19:46.100
Do I really have to
explain this to you people?

19:46.100 --> 19:48.600
We're in the business
of business.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.500
Oil, software, Worldwide Wickets...
The product doesn't matter.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.900
It's the game that matters. Get to the top,
be the best, have the most, win.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.300
- Win <i>what?</i>
- You're still missing the point.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.300
That Angel talkin'? 'Cause it sounds
a lot more like Angelus.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.200
Oh, if I were Angelus, half of you would
already be dead, just for the fun of it.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.600
One of us already is.
We havin' fun yet?

20:11.700 --> 20:13.700
You wanna know the truth?

20:13.700 --> 20:16.700
The truth is there's only one of us
who ever understood how things really work.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.100
- Lorne.
- Whoa. Hey, h-hey.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.800
Can I not be the poster child
for your nervous breakdown here?

20:22.800 --> 20:27.800
You didn't judge. You didn't spend your life
obsessed with good and evil.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.400
You do that, you get swallowed...
lost in the minutiae.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.200
Good, bad, Angel, Angelus...
None of it makes a difference.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.400
I wish it did, but...

20:35.400 --> 20:39.000
You know, an ant with the best intentions
or the most diabolical schemes...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
is just exactly an ant.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.300
And there is one thing
in this business...

20:45.300 --> 20:48.900
in this apocalypse that we call a world
that matters... power.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.900
Power tips the scale.
Power sets the course.

20:50.900 --> 20:55.600
And until I have real power...
global power... I have nothing.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.500
I accomplish nothing.

20:57.500 --> 21:03.200
- And how you get this power...
<i>- Isn't pretty. Isn't fun.</i>

21:03.200 --> 21:05.900
You think it's Wolfram and Hart
getting to me here...

21:05.900 --> 21:10.900
and maybe you're right, because
they've shown us what power is.

21:10.900 --> 21:13.100
From day one, they've been
callin' the shots...

21:13.100 --> 21:15.700
and all we've done
is get shot at.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.700
I have a chance
to change that.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.900
And will you?

21:19.900 --> 21:23.800
I mean, not to play an old saw,
but power does traditionally corrupt.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.800
I mean, you get
high up enough, and...

21:25.800 --> 21:28.000
well, the people,
they do start to look like ants.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
I can't worry about that.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.900
- The small stuff.
- Angel?

21:33.900 --> 21:37.200
That important phone call from...
that guy about that thing...

<i>Yeah. "The guy about the thing."</i>

21:52.700 --> 21:57.700
The "small stuff'
that you can't worry about?

21:57.700 --> 22:01.700
- Would that include Fred?
- I loved Fred.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.000
- That's not an answer.
- Then I guess you don't get one.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.700
There's got to be something...
behind all this.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.500
A reason.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
It could be a ploy.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.900
- For God's sake, say something.
- What would you like me to say?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.400
Tell you that Angel
loved Fred...

22:29.400 --> 22:32.700
and that in an eon of eons
he would never harm her in any way?

22:34.300 --> 22:36.300
I wish I could, Wes.

22:36.300 --> 22:40.800
But if he believes what he's saying,
and I believe he does...

22:40.800 --> 22:43.400
Doesn't make any sense.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.300
Angel never cared
about power.

22:46.300 --> 22:50.300
Well, he's never had any
to care about, has he?

22:50.300 --> 22:54.000
Not real power,
even as Angelus.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.500
And then just like that,
he's king of the mountain.

23:03.500 --> 23:07.100
Even if they start
with the... best intentions.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.400
Angel's seen real power and...

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
he's not lookin' away.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
He's gonna go for it, Wes.

- It's typical.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.700
You sleep with a guy, and he sends
your entire family out of the country.

24:16.700 --> 24:21.100
No, wait. That's actually
not that typical at all.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.500
You couldn't just...
not call?

24:23.500 --> 24:26.100
- It's not safe here.
- Is it ever?

24:26.100 --> 24:28.400
I wanna be with you

24:28.400 --> 24:30.900
You don't wanna be with me.
You don't wanna be near me.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.600
- Because I might get hurt?
- Because I'm the thing that'll hurt you.

I wanna be with you?

- I don't know.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.700
I play this game.

26:22.700 --> 26:26.100
It's pointless
and annoys me...

26:27.300 --> 26:29.500
and yet I'm compelled
to play on.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.400
Does that not...

26:35.300 --> 26:38.000
Well, lookee lookee
who's making friends.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.800
- Marcus.
- Dro? How have you been?

26:41.800 --> 26:45.100
- You're acquainted with this creature.
- Yes.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.000
- We go way back, don't we?
- Too far.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.600
Mmm, the good old days.
So, I hear you're living in a tree now.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.900
The tree... is the entrance
to the Deeper Well.

26:55.900 --> 27:00.400
I live in a cave.
It's... really quite pleasant.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.800
Sure it's a peach.
Afraid you won't be returning to it again.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.500
You will not harm him.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.800
[Chuckles]
Oh, you mean like this?

27:08.800 --> 27:11.200
Uh!
[Groans]

27:14.600 --> 27:16.400
Uhh!

27:17.700 --> 27:19.600
Hang on, Dro.
This'll just take a second.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.800
[Inhales]
I gotta tell you. I'm a little disappointed.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.200
Didn't think a big scary Old One
bled this easily.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.500
<i>- [Groans]</i>
- Maybe it's this skinny
little body you chose to infect.

27:38.500 --> 27:42.400
Or maybe it's that ray gun they shot you with
to keep you from exploding.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.100
Or maybe...

27:46.100 --> 27:49.900
you're... just...
not... that...

27:49.900 --> 27:52.000
[Groaning]

27:52.000 --> 27:54.700
- Cool.
- [Cries Out]

27:54.700 --> 27:57.600
[Breathing Heavily]

27:57.600 --> 28:00.200
Yes, that's probably it.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.500
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna beat it out of me?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.400
If you say so.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.600
We all know
how this goes.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.600
<i>Spike beats you to a bloody pulp, you beg</i>
<i>for mercy, and we get what we came for.</i>

28:13.600 --> 28:15.800
- Who needs all that rigamarole?
<i>- I told you.</i>

28:15.800 --> 28:19.100
I don't know why Angel
gave up that kid or anything else.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.400
Me and him,
not too close.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
Now can I get back to
my game of solitaire?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.000
- Where'd you get that?
- Doesn't matter.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.300
- What does it mean?
- [Laughs]

28:34.300 --> 28:36.400
Is that what
all this is about?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.800
All these questions
about Angel?

28:40.000 --> 28:43.800
No. No way.
No way they'd take Angel.

28:44.100 --> 28:48.600
- Who "they"?
- Circle of the Black Thorn.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.200
- Sounds like a little sewing club for pirates.
- It's a secret society.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.100
- Never heard of'em.
- That's 'cause they're secret.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.800
<i>There's plenty</i>
<i>of these cabals about.</i>

28:57.800 --> 28:59.800
Usually spend
a lot of time in basements...

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
paddling one another's bums
to prove their manhood.

29:01.800 --> 29:06.200
These are not frat boys, Spike.
Circle's small. It's elite.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.700
They got connections
you boys can't even comprehend.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.100
- They're evil.
- Sure.

29:11.100 --> 29:13.600
But evil's not the point.
Power is.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.400
- Power.
- Okay, we get it. They're badass.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.600
- What do they do?
- [Laughs]

29:18.600 --> 29:21.600
Geez.
You guys always this slow?

29:21.600 --> 29:25.900
Huh? Starts with "A"?
Ends in "pocalypse"?

29:25.900 --> 29:29.200
<i>It's a well-oiled machine,</i>
<i>this circle.</i>

29:29.200 --> 29:31.700
These people grease the wheels,
keep the parts in place...

29:31.700 --> 29:35.200
make sure man's inhumanity
to man keeps rollin' along.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.100
I thought the senior partners
were responsible for the apocalypse.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.300
Senior partners
are on a different plane.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.300
Down here, it's the players in the circle
that make things happen.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.300
Hell, you... you get tapped
by one of them...

29:45.300 --> 29:47.600
that's kinda like gettin' the keys
to the chocolate factory.

29:47.600 --> 29:52.400
That's why you came back
to L.A., tried to kill Angel...

29:55.600 --> 29:58.000
to get into the circle.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.900
To be a Black Thorn is to be
the senior partners' instrument on Earth.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.000
Doesn't get bigger than that.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Looks like Angel succeeded
where you failed.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.100
- He doesn't have it in him.
- Doesn't have what in him?

30:10.100 --> 30:12.900
Well, for starters, he's got to give up
the champion angle...

30:12.900 --> 30:15.500
quit savin' girls in alleys.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.900
Probably wouldn't even...
make it on the circle's radar...

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
till he killed
one of his lieutenants.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.600
The senior partners,
the circle...

30:27.600 --> 30:29.800
They're killing Angel
by degrees.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.900
And we all watched it happen.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.600
Guy I knew wouldn't want this...
wouldn't wanna be this.

30:39.700 --> 30:44.100
Angel dedicated his life
to helping others.

30:44.100 --> 30:47.500
Not because he had to,
but because it was a path he'd chosen.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.200
If he's been swayed from that...
influenced...

30:57.200 --> 30:59.200
then maybe
there's still time.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.600
We can bring him back.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.400
He'd do the same for any of us,
regardless of our actions.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.000
Yeah, but what if he's skipped too far
down that evil brick road?

31:23.100 --> 31:26.100

Embrace this worthy son.

32:26.500 --> 32:30.500

32:30.500 --> 32:33.900
[All] The thorn is the power
and the power is absolute.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.700
Welcome to the fold.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.800
Well done, Angel.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.000
- [Applause]
- Well done.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.500
See, didn't I tell ya
it was gonna happen?

32:49.500 --> 32:52.700
And how about that lamb we got you
for the slaughter? Any idea who that was?

32:52.700 --> 32:55.800
- Drogyn the Battlebrand.
- Damn straight.

32:55.800 --> 33:00.400
We got you some supercharged warrior juice,
not some schmuck. You must feel great.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.000
Okay. Let me introduce you
around to a few people.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.200
Some of these folks you know,
some you don't.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.400
Of course, you're acquainted
with the archduke.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
Kudos, child.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.500
I must say, it's gratifying to see
you've returned to form, Angelus.

33:15.500 --> 33:20.400
- It's still Angel.
- Ah. Well, what's in a name, eh?

33:20.400 --> 33:22.600
<i>In the spirit</i>
<i>of our new alliance...</i>

33:22.600 --> 33:24.500
you must allow me to throw
a dinner party in your honor.

33:24.500 --> 33:29.100
- You know how I love parties.
- It's nice to see you again so soon, Angel.

33:29.100 --> 33:34.100
Senator. I had no idea
you were so well-connected.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.200
Well, I'm not gonna take
the White House in 2008...

33:36.200 --> 33:39.900
on just my sparkling wit
and funding from hostile governments.

33:39.900 --> 33:43.600
- [Laughs]
- [Laughs] I expect not.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.900
Excuse us, Helen. Angel, I've got someone
here who would like to pay his respects.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.500
- Vail.
- You've been looking for me.

33:51.500 --> 33:54.500
Actually, I've been...
Iooking like I'm looking for you.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.800
- Appearances, you know?

33:56.800 --> 33:59.800

it was all good.

worked out for the best.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.900
[Raspy Laughing]

34:18.300 --> 34:21.699

<i>Oh, yeah. Everybody's here.</i>
<i>Here, let me freshen that up.</i>

<i>get yourselves hurt.</i>

Giving up the baby to the Fell Brethren,
workin' for Senator Bitch...

tryin' to take out Drogyn
to cover up what you did to Fred.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.300
And for what? To get in bed
with the Circle of the Black Thorn?

35:16.300 --> 35:18.800
So you figured it out.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.500
Yeah, a little singin'
from a jailbird we know and loathe.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Lindsey.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.400
- [Scoffs] And you believed him.
- Doesn't have a reason to lie.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.900
- Doesn't need one.
- Unlike you?

35:30.900 --> 35:34.700
What I do here
is my business.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.400
You don't like how I conduct it,
you can leave before I kill you.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.600
Kill us? Hard to believe we're
having trouble trusting you.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.900
- Just telling it like it is.
- Then we have a problem.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.700
I guess we do.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.600
[Gasps]

35:57.600 --> 35:59.400
- We done?
- Let him go.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.400
You don't give the orders.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.900
Lorne, pull this thing
out of me.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.800
<i>Easy. I'm not in a great mood.</i>
<i>[Gasps]</i>

36:07.800 --> 36:11.800
Good. Now, let's finish this.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.600
<i>Involvare.</i>

36:19.600 --> 36:22.500
All right.
We have six minutes.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.400
- Till what?
- The glamour collapses.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.100
As far as anyone outside is concerned,
we're still at each other's throats.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.800
- Aren't we?
- We don't have a lot of time,
so I'm gonna make this short.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.100
Everything you <i>think</i> you know,
everything you've heard... is a lie.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.800
- Why should we believe you?
- Because I'm the one who told it.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.500
- Read any good books lately?
<i>- You</i> sent us the message?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.400
- And the assassin to kill Drogyn.
- So that part was true.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.200
I knew Drogyn could handle himself.
I told the assassin just enough...

36:44.200 --> 36:46.900
to lead Drogyn to think I played a part
in resurrecting Illyria.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.100
I figured he'd come here
lookin' for allies against me.

36:49.100 --> 36:51.000
Why would you want us
to believe you killed Fred?

36:51.000 --> 36:53.600
- Because <i>they</i> needed to believe it.
- The Black Thorn.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.700
They needed to believe my own
people didn't trust me anymore.

36:56.700 --> 37:01.500
They needed to believe a person as good and
as pure as Drogyn considered me an enemy.

37:02.900 --> 37:06.200
It was the only way
to gain their confidence.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.100
Oh, so this whole Evil Angel
thing's been a big scamola.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
Huh. I smell Oscar.

37:12.100 --> 37:17.800
- When did this all start?
- Two months ago, with a kiss.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.700
<i>- Though it didn't hit me till later that night.</i>
- [Gasps]

37:26.300 --> 37:28.400
Cordelia gave you her visions.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.800
One-shot deal.

37:30.800 --> 37:36.600
She put me on the path,
showed me where the real powers are.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.700
But I couldn't see
who they were.

37:38.700 --> 37:44.400
And then Fred died, and I wasn't going to
let that be another random, horrible event...

37:44.400 --> 37:47.100
in another random,
horrible world.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
So I decided to use it...

37:49.100 --> 37:51.500
to make her death matter.

37:52.700 --> 37:56.100
<i>And it worked.</i>
<i>I'm in.</i>

37:58.500 --> 38:03.200
I've seen the faces of evil. I know who
the real powers in the apocalypse are.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.200
So all that
"power tilts the scales" crap...

38:06.200 --> 38:08.300
It's true.
We're in a machine.

38:08.300 --> 38:11.100
That machine's gonna be here
long after our bodies are dust.

38:11.100 --> 38:15.100
The senior partners will always exist in one
form or another because mankind is weak.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.100
Do you want me to point
my crossbow at him...

38:17.100 --> 38:19.000
'cause I think he's gonna
start talkin' about ants again.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.800
<i>We</i> are weak.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.600
The powerful
control everything...

38:25.900 --> 38:28.400
except our will to choose.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.200
Look, Lindsey's a pathetic half-wit,
but he was right about one thing.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.200
Heroes don't accept
the way the world is.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.700
The senior partners may be eternal,
but we can make their existence painful.

38:36.700 --> 38:39.100
You wanna take them on?

38:39.100 --> 38:42.300
We're in a machine.
The Black Thorn runs it.

38:42.300 --> 38:45.800
We can bring their gears to a grinding halt,
even if it's just for a moment.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.500
'Bout time we got
our hands dirty.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.900
This isn't a "keep fighting
the good fight" kind of a deal.

38:49.900 --> 38:52.500
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

38:52.500 --> 38:56.400
I'm talking about killing
every... single... member...

38:56.700 --> 38:58.600
of the Black Thorn.

39:01.800 --> 39:06.700
- We don't walk away from that.
- Do we crawl away at least?

39:06.700 --> 39:09.200
We do this, the senior partners
will rain their full wrath.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.200
They'll make an example of us.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.500
I'm talkin' full-on hell, not the basic
fire-and-brimstone kind we're used to.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.000
- We know the drill.
<i>- No, you don't.</i>

39:17.000 --> 39:19.400
Ten to one, we're gone
when the smoke clears.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.700
They will do everything
in their power to destroy us.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.500
So... I need you to be sure.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.400
Power endures.

39:32.400 --> 39:36.300
We can't bring down the senior partners,
but for one bright, shiny moment...

39:36.600 --> 39:39.300
we can show them
that they don't own us.

39:39.300 --> 39:42.600
You need to decide
for yourselves...

39:42.600 --> 39:44.800
if that's worth dying for.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.900
<i>I can't order you</i>
<i>to do this.</i>

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
Can't do it without ya.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.600
So we'll vote...
as a team.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.200
Think about
what I'm askin' you to do.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.800
Think about
what I'm askin' you to give.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.300
Kill 'em all.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.800
Burn the house down
while we're still in it.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.000
Somethin' like that.

40:26.700 --> 40:30.100
[Exhales]
I'm in.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.600
I'm in.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.200
- Drop him!
- Angel, you don't want it to go like this.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.300
- Drop... You and l...
- Wes!
- Let him go!

40:55.300 --> 40:59.100
Angel, we've got three people here!
Drop him!
