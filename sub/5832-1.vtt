00:36.346 --> 00:44.346
When Allah created the heavens and the earth,
he created Humans from clay and Angels from light

00:44.492 --> 00:47.000
But he created another being from fire. Djinn

00:47.300 --> 00:50.818
Allah has seperated Man from Djinn

00:51.313 --> 00:58.708
But sometimes, their worlds come together,
and this always causes great suffering

03:35.268 --> 03:37.128
Khalid needs to be close to his family.

03:38.226 --> 03:41.327
He knows how this will make you stronger.

03:42.302 --> 03:45.442
It's time. Listen to him.

03:46.599 --> 03:48.168
You must return.

03:54.029 --> 03:56.264
You can't deny the past.

03:56.602 --> 03:58.035
It's what makes us who we are.

03:59.747 --> 04:01.222
If you won't accept it..

04:01.458 --> 04:03.226
..how will we have a future?

04:04.572 --> 04:06.364
You must go back. It's time.

04:06.365 --> 04:08.151
You're not thinking clearly. It is time.

04:08.152 --> 04:09.321
Khalid must return.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.681
You will not stand in my way.

04:31.656 --> 04:34.349
How can you reject a request
from the man you love?

06:04.444 --> 06:05.494
We won!

06:52.553 --> 06:54.396
Tell your American friend
not to make fun of this matter.

06:54.397 --> 06:55.625
I only came here for you.

06:55.731 --> 06:57.651
If this continues, I swear I'm leaving.

10:46.624 --> 10:48.707
Or more likely to change his diaper.

14:51.199 --> 14:54.188
We thought you'd never get here.

14:54.189 --> 14:55.000
Welcome home Khalid.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.664
Thank you, sir.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.822
It was a long flight.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.025
Well, you're back in civilization now.

15:05.158 --> 15:06.967
Welcome home sweetie.

15:16.444 --> 15:17.884
Come. the car is right outside.

15:59.983 --> 16:01.267
So did you hear? Yasmin had a baby?

16:01.668 --> 16:02.200
No.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.050
So did Afra.

16:03.060 --> 16:03.978
And Maitha.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.333
All your old friends.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.036
What?

16:07.319 --> 16:09.297
I just want to be a grandmother.

16:11.021 --> 16:11.500
Well...

16:11.550 --> 16:12.984
Now that you're back...

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
it wouldn't hurt to go for an Umrah...

16:14.244 --> 16:15.987
so God will bless your new life here.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.300
God willing.

16:52.550 --> 16:54.626
Nasser, don't drive so fast.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.042
I'm going five miles an hour.

16:56.105 --> 16:57.280
Any slower and we'll stop.

16:57.971 --> 16:59.931
So how did you find the place?

17:00.073 --> 17:01.049
My company found it.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.763
They got it all set up.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.708
But why Al Hamra?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.601
They just tore down the old village.

17:05.704 --> 17:06.906
How fast were they able
to build a new tower here?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.300
Yes, can you believe it?

17:08.571 --> 17:09.222
They built it

17:10.010 --> 17:11.030
right on the djinn village.

17:11.128 --> 17:12.171
They have no respect.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.198
Whatever.

17:13.394 --> 17:14.954
It's a new building... on the beach.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.436
A great place for a vacation.

17:17.633 --> 17:18.800
Khalid

17:19.627 --> 17:21.268
Are you going to make that long drive everyday?

17:22.000 --> 17:22.979
I don't get it.

17:23.298 --> 17:24.438
Why didn't they put you in the city?

17:24.551 --> 17:25.936
They said it's nice.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.637
The Palm is nice.

17:27.661 --> 17:28.779
Abu Dhabi is nice.

17:28.807 --> 17:29.666
But this?

17:31.582 --> 17:32.783
Daddy! What are you doing?

17:34.057 --> 17:35.417
Someone was standing in the middle of the road!

17:35.883 --> 17:37.623
I could have killed him.

17:37.737 --> 17:38.572
He looked...

17:38.965 --> 17:40.365
Don't get out!

17:41.453 --> 17:42.445
He might be hurt.

17:42.684 --> 17:43.635
Stay here, sir. I'll look.

19:12.928 --> 19:15.418
How is anyone supposed
to find this place, Khalid?

19:28.669 --> 19:30.503
Does anyone else live here

19:30.910 --> 19:31.987
It's new.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.940
It's probably like every other project built
out here, all bought up by the Gulf Arabs.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.950
And they're not here but in winter.

19:38.498 --> 19:41.957
Then you'll wish if it was deserted.

20:38.796 --> 20:41.688
I don't trust that Sammy guy.

20:42.548 --> 20:43.182
Why not?

20:44.478 --> 20:47.338
He's too friendly. He wants something.

20:47.752 --> 20:49.052
You watch out, Salama.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.183
Nice!

20:52.270 --> 20:54.870
They've put a lot of effort into this place.

21:03.369 --> 21:04.369
Come.

21:06.229 --> 21:07.254
Welcome.

21:21.979 --> 21:22.946
Oh my...

21:23.360 --> 21:24.900
What a beautiful place.

21:26.479 --> 21:29.499
You'll have a nice view of the sea...

21:29.550 --> 21:31.104
...if the fog ever clears.

21:31.129 --> 21:33.639
You know I'm afraid of heights.

21:36.772 --> 21:37.807
You know what this place need?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.200
It needs this.

21:41.201 --> 21:43.227
You never know who might visit.

21:49.739 --> 21:50.906
What?

21:51.098 --> 21:52.858
It wards off envy.

21:52.964 --> 21:54.000
It can't hurt, right?

21:54.644 --> 21:55.881
Thank you. Mamma.

21:56.291 --> 21:57.727
It's... very nice of you.

21:58.347 --> 21:59.389
And this...

21:59.452 --> 22:00.160
..will help ward off evil.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.010
Hang it over the entrance.

22:03.032 --> 22:04.742
Yes, Momma.

22:15.872 --> 22:16.430
Come on...

22:16.721 --> 22:19.172
...let's see the rest.

22:34.636 --> 22:36.705
They sure pulled out all the stops.

22:37.907 --> 22:39.515
Looks like a lot of effort.

22:39.590 --> 22:40.916
They did a nice job.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.837
There's more down here!

23:00.810 --> 23:03.328
For my grandchildren.

24:48.383 --> 24:50.558
What happened?

24:53.582 --> 24:54.766
There was a bird.

24:56.697 --> 24:58.332
But I thought it was something else.

25:00.361 --> 25:01.795
Someone.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.340
On the sixth floor?

25:03.673 --> 25:05.533
Probably one of those window washers.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.508
I know their kind...

25:08.380 --> 25:09.606
They're perverts.

25:09.946 --> 25:12.381
Peeking in when I take a bath.

25:12.676 --> 25:14.736
Don't you wish.

25:15.394 --> 25:17.662
Come on. It's time to go.

25:31.952 --> 25:33.692
Why don't you stay a little longer?

25:34.002 --> 25:35.780
At least until the fog clears.

25:35.822 --> 25:36.256
We have to go.

25:36.367 --> 25:37.552
You two must rest.

25:37.647 --> 25:39.590
I have some work at the office.

25:39.554 --> 25:41.198
We'll be back tomorrow.

25:41.477 --> 25:43.721
Enjoy your new home.

25:52.001 --> 25:53.602
Welcome back, Khalid.

25:53.748 --> 25:58.418
I don't know how you convinced
her to return. Thank you so much.

25:58.962 --> 26:00.062
It wasn't easy sir.

26:33.266 --> 26:34.792
That flight is brutal.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.151
Now what? What is wrong with you?

28:04.971 --> 28:06.471
We're going to die!

28:06.731 --> 28:07.256
Great...

28:07.284 --> 28:08.319
That's the spirit.

28:08.589 --> 28:10.241
Always optimistic.

28:11.967 --> 28:13.627
Come on! Start, you piece of...

28:13.651 --> 28:16.011
Daddy, I'm calling Salama and Khalid.

28:16.211 --> 28:17.711
Okay. Call them.

28:19.007 --> 28:20.038
That's weird.

28:26.728 --> 28:27.954
I'll call a tow truck.

28:32.770 --> 28:33.450
We're in the middle of the desert!

28:33.679 --> 28:34.542
The phones won't work!

28:35.025 --> 28:36.793
Of course they'll work.

28:36.827 --> 28:37.928
We just left the building.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.175
And anyway, this is satellite...

28:42.690 --> 28:43.999
What? What? What is it

28:44.032 --> 28:45.124
Well? What's the problem?

28:45.780 --> 28:46.548
What is wrong with you?

28:48.706 --> 28:50.276
There' someone out there.

28:56.753 --> 28:58.993
There is no one outside.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.572
Don't be like your sister.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.275
Nasser.

29:01.329 --> 29:02.342
Daddy! Please don't!

29:02.886 --> 29:03.780
What? What's the problem?

29:03.929 --> 29:05.030
Don't go out there.

29:05.302 --> 29:06.482
We are in the middle of the dessert.

29:06.563 --> 29:07.998
What could possibly be there?

29:55.467 --> 29:57.026
No!

29:57.372 --> 29:59.732
I will not have my family treated like this!

30:00.330 --> 30:01.332
No!

30:01.440 --> 30:02.589
Daddy! Don't!

30:03.576 --> 30:06.135
Let me go!

30:10.259 --> 30:12.277
Where are you?

30:12.285 --> 30:13.929
Where are you, you cowards?

30:14.009 --> 30:15.028
You want Nasser?

30:15.773 --> 30:16.073
Come get me!

30:17.155 --> 30:19.205
Come on!
You got Nasser to deal with now!

30:19.314 --> 30:21.698
Where are you, you cowards?

30:21.945 --> 30:22.996
Where are you?

30:26.053 --> 30:27.014
This is bullshit!

30:28.448 --> 30:29.051
Bullshit.

31:30.006 --> 31:31.223
Not America.

31:34.131 --> 31:35.224
At least, try.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.982
Khalid, I'm going crazy.

45:11.124 --> 45:13.653
I can't believe I'm saying this, but..

45:13.700 --> 45:15.926
I'm beginning to believe the stories.

45:53.597 --> 45:54.657
In the name of God,

45:54.660 --> 45:56.073
the most gracious,

45:56.103 --> 45:57.382
the merciful...

45:59.110 --> 46:02.087
Praise be to God...

46:02.753 --> 46:06.979
...the Cherisher ...and...and...

46:07.006 --> 46:08.316
I ask for God's forgiveness.

46:13.464 --> 46:14.800
In the name of God, the most gracious,

46:14.848 --> 46:15.842
the merciful,

46:17.612 --> 46:18.932
I seek refuge in the Lord of...

46:20.292 --> 46:22.434
I seek refuge in the Lord of Mankind...

46:23.924 --> 46:26.274
...the King of mankind,

46:26.563 --> 46:27.505
the true God of mankind,

46:28.649 --> 46:29.889
from the evil of the sneaking whisperer,

46:31.004 --> 46:37.437
who whispereth in the hearts of mankind,

46:38.345 --> 46:40.545
of the djinn and mankind.

46:41.345 --> 46:42.545
God is the greatest.

46:43.527 --> 46:47.267
Glorified is my lord, the almighty

46:48.858 --> 46:49.918
God listens to those who are grateful.

46:50.362 --> 46:51.487
God is the greatest.

46:52.107 --> 46:58.547
Glory be to God exalted.

46:58.707 --> 46:59.547
God is the greatest.

47:06.053 --> 47:07.095
How did you get in here?

47:07.596 --> 47:08.371
Your door was open.

47:10.938 --> 47:14.048
It has been a long time since I've
seen you pray Salama.

47:15.860 --> 47:16.828
Where's Daddy?

47:17.752 --> 47:18.852
Outside.

47:19.232 --> 47:22.542
There is something important I
needed to tell you. I couldn't wait.

47:37.466 --> 47:38.566
It's about the child.

47:42.649 --> 47:45.639
Many couples have suffered the loss
of an infant child, Salama.

47:46.249 --> 47:47.639
I know.

47:49.649 --> 47:50.639
And of course you want kids.

47:51.052 --> 47:52.492
Why haven't you tried again?

47:55.572 --> 47:56.506
I'm just not ready.

47:59.135 --> 48:00.485
Not ready...

48:02.390 --> 48:04.680
..to see another child that looks
like your previous baby?

48:08.069 --> 48:10.388
Murder is a sin, Salama.

48:17.063 --> 48:18.874
How did you know?

48:41.425 --> 48:45.708
I didn't mean to hurt him.

48:47.027 --> 48:50.045
Then what did you mean?

48:58.744 --> 49:00.454
Go clean yourself.

49:50.087 --> 49:51.154
Hello?

49:51.652 --> 49:54.072
Hello. I need to speak to Salama Zakaria

49:54.152 --> 49:56.072
Salama speaking...

49:57.152 --> 50:01.372
This is the police. I am sorry to report
...there has been a terrible accident.

50:29.036 --> 50:31.012
I can't talk about it now.

50:33.187 --> 50:34.856
I need to be alone.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.320
Then walk me to the car.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.879
And come say bye to your family.

51:05.852 --> 51:06.845
I love you.

52:54.035 --> 52:57.569
Murder is a sin.

56:39.535 --> 56:40.669
I didn't say anything.

56:47.535 --> 56:48.669
You just moved in here today, didn't you?

56:49.535 --> 56:50.669
Yes.

56:50.935 --> 56:51.669
How did you know?

56:51.935 --> 56:53.969
There aren't many people
living in this building.

56:54.035 --> 56:56.069
I've never met you before.

56:58.535 --> 56:59.969
Are you from Ras Al Khaima?

57:00.035 --> 57:00.769
Yes, I am.

57:01.135 --> 57:02.069
How did you know?

57:02.935 --> 57:03.969
We used to live here.

57:04.035 --> 57:07.069
But my parents moved when the
village was torn down.

57:07.935 --> 57:08.469
But...

57:08.935 --> 57:11.469
...they couldn't get rid of me.

57:13.535 --> 57:14.869
Well, I'm glad.

57:30.735 --> 57:32.869
I must have forgotten to press my floor...

57:37.537 --> 57:38.869
More time to chat.

57:39.537 --> 57:40.369
What a coincidence.

57:40.937 --> 57:42.569
I'm on the sixth floor too.

57:47.537 --> 57:49.869
I met your wife today.

57:50.537 --> 57:51.869
She told me about you.

57:52.537 --> 57:54.569
There's not much to tell.

57:54.637 --> 57:55.669
Oh come on...

57:56.037 --> 57:58.869
I'll have to find out some other way.

57:59.037 --> 58:00.869
You do that...

58:01.137 --> 58:02.769
If you have to.

58:02.837 --> 58:03.839
I'll help you.

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:32.892
And why not?

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.000
Hi again!

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:56.292
Hello.

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.392
What a pleasant surprise.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.550
Who's there?

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.113
Who are you?

01:05:34.084 --> 01:05:35.284
Well..

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.125
Did you forget me, Khalid?

01:08:36.752 --> 01:08:38.935
Police. How can we help you?

01:08:40.227 --> 01:08:43.161
Look, I know this sounds crazy but...

01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:44.676
I can't find my wife.

01:08:44.756 --> 01:08:46.497
I think something bad has happened.

01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:47.709
Where are you calling from, sir?

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:48.531
The Al Hamra.

01:08:48.828 --> 01:08:52.540
We just moved into the new building.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.679
I am here.

01:10:34.896 --> 01:10:36.456
I told you that call was nothing.

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:39.437
This place won't be open for months.

01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:45.572
Can't you hear me?

01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:50.182
I am here.

01:10:54.191 --> 01:10:55.241
I am here.

01:10:56.546 --> 01:10:59.341
Well, we had to check it. You heard
the screams from the call.

01:10:59.431 --> 01:11:02.700
And now that we checked it,
can we please go?

01:11:02.784 --> 01:11:04.521
This place gives me the creeps.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.398
I'm here right in front of you!

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:10.851
Come back!

01:11:11.079 --> 01:11:12.679
What's your problem?

01:11:12.729 --> 01:11:14.915
Don't tell me you never heard any
stories about Al Hamra...

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:19.100
Help me! Help me please!

01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:48.523
It's time.

01:15:46.761 --> 01:15:48.704
She's inside me, Khalid.

01:15:48.864 --> 01:15:49.931
Who?

01:15:50.506 --> 01:15:51.632
Who is she?

01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:53.532
She's making me do this.

01:15:58.508 --> 01:15:59.941
She's coming.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.017
Khalid, help me!

01:17:09.817 --> 01:17:12.053
You were taken away from me once.

01:17:12.069 --> 01:17:13.588
But I never gave up on you.

01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:15.634
I kept looking for you.

01:17:15.843 --> 01:17:16.618
Come back to me.

01:17:17.743 --> 01:17:20.552
Didn't she kill your son?

01:17:32.268 --> 01:17:33.952
She deserves to die.

01:17:40.477 --> 01:17:41.669
True.

01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:51.487
You know what to do.

01:17:55.621 --> 01:17:56.675
You killed my son!

01:18:03.859 --> 01:18:05.085
You are one of them.

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:07.236
Please God, save me.

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:09.872
Don't say god's name.

01:18:11.152 --> 01:18:12.053
He was our son!

01:18:12.418 --> 01:18:13.768
And you killed him!

01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:17.673
Feed your anger.

01:18:18.608 --> 01:18:19.876
Feed on your hatred.

01:18:20.204 --> 01:18:22.264
Embrace your true nature.

01:18:22.451 --> 01:18:23.718
You took him away from me.

01:18:24.273 --> 01:18:26.209
As I was taken away from my mother.

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:28.239
But she kept looking for me.

01:18:28.723 --> 01:18:29.782
Unlike you..

01:18:31.776 --> 01:18:33.664
A mother sacrifices for her child.

01:18:34.428 --> 01:18:35.828
You're not a mother!

01:18:35.867 --> 01:18:36.635
You're a monster.

01:18:42.887 --> 01:18:44.831
Blood for blood.

01:18:45.297 --> 01:18:46.439
A life for a life.

01:19:03.571 --> 01:19:06.264
This is my home, I'm back.
