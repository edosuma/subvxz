12:58.711 --> 13:03.273
And as a real person, I've made some
humorous observations about real life.

13:03.382 --> 13:07.113
For example, have you ever noticed
how there are two phone books...

13:07.219 --> 13:09.779
a white one and a yellow one?

13:09.889 --> 13:11.880
[Chuckles]
Like, what's the deal with that?

13:11.991 --> 13:14.459
One's residential,
the other is business.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.826
Oh, well, that makes sense.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.263
What will they think of next,
blue pages?

13:21.367 --> 13:24.268
They have those.
They're government listings.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.668
I see.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.842
Uh, what about two-cent stamps?

13:30.943 --> 13:33.173
Pizza pie is
very hot these days.

13:33.279 --> 13:37.340
Can't open pickle jars.
No mail on Sunday. Out of paper towels.

13:37.449 --> 13:42.148
- Oh, oh, oh. What's the deal with cardboard?
- Boo!

13:42.254 --> 13:44.347
All right, let's just
move on to Notebook 2.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.583
- I've really gotta get dinner started.
- Me too.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.592
I also have to go. Boo!

13:48.694 --> 13:50.594
[Groans]

13:50.696 --> 13:53.392
- Krusty, the acoustics in here-
- I appreciate the effort, kid.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.660
But there's only
one thing left for me to do.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.596
[Chattering]

13:59.705 --> 14:01.605
Thank you for coming.

14:01.707 --> 14:05.837
[Clears Throat]
"Smart lads who slip at times away...

14:05.945 --> 14:08.778
"From fields where
glory will not stay...

14:08.881 --> 14:11.349
"Runners whom
the race outran...

14:11.450 --> 14:13.611
And the name died
before the man."

14:13.719 --> 14:16.119
- Krusty, does this have a point?
- Yes.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.191
I'm quitting show business.
I was just trying to go out...

14:19.291 --> 14:22.226
with a little class, you jackass.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.422
But, Krusty, why now?
Why not 20 years ago?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.863
'Cause comedy
ain't funny anymore.

14:27.967 --> 14:31.926
Instead of time-tested jokes about
women drivers and doctor bills...

14:32.037 --> 14:34.267
you got some
big-chin schlub...

14:34.373 --> 14:37.433
reading typos from
the <i>Ralookaville Rost.</i>

14:37.543 --> 14:40.808
Well, here's a headline for you:
Nobody cares.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.541
[Laughing]

14:43.649 --> 14:45.947
Hey, I washed your hair.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.951
These comics today.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.385
"Ooh, look at me.
I can't set my V.C.R.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.457
"I can't open a bag
of airline peanuts.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.458
I'm a freakir moron."

14:54.560 --> 14:56.687
[Laughing]

14:56.795 --> 14:59.491
[Laughing]
Krusty's gone nuts.

14:59.598 --> 15:02.931
Then you got these lady comics
talking about stuff...

15:03.035 --> 15:05.230
that would embarrass
Redd Foxx-

15:05.337 --> 15:07.328
God rest his smutty soul.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.465
Who they slept with.
What time they sit on the can.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.068
- This is supposed to get you a husband?
- [Laughing]

15:14.179 --> 15:16.841
What the hell are you laughir at?
I'm just tellir the truth.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.407
- [Laughing] And it's funny.
- It is?

15:20.519 --> 15:24.182
In that case, I'm proud to announce
my triumphant return to comedy.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.588
[Cheering]

15:33.499 --> 15:37.128
- "Four drink minimum"?
- I'll cover you, honey.

15:37.236 --> 15:40.205
Hi, how you folks doing?
I'm Moe.

15:40.306 --> 15:46.211
Or, as the ladies like to call me,
"Hey, you, behind the bushes."

15:46.312 --> 15:50.874
- Is this thing on?
- No. Sorry, Moe.

15:50.983 --> 15:54.544
- <i>[Feedback On R.A.]</i>
- And now, without further Apu.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.178
I have been zinged and I love it.

15:57.289 --> 16:02.556
The last angry clown, the man
who spews truth from every orifice...

16:02.661 --> 16:05.494
ladies and gentlemen, Krusty.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.903
So I'm watchir TV today-

16:17.009 --> 16:18.977
Whoo! TV, yeah!

16:19.078 --> 16:21.444
All I keep seeir is dead
celebrities hawkir products.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.914
The got poor Vincent Price
floatir around on a toilet cake...

16:25.017 --> 16:28.851
tellir me about
"the horrors of an 'unfresh' bowl."

16:28.954 --> 16:30.819
[Laughing]

16:30.923 --> 16:34.188
And I tell you somethir else,
I do not believe Winston Churchill...

16:34.293 --> 16:36.318
would eat
at Der Wienerschnitzel.

16:36.428 --> 16:39.556
[Laughing]

16:39.665 --> 16:43.260
There's nothir those Madison Avenue
grave robbers won't do...

16:43.369 --> 16:46.770
- to get us to buy their crap.
- [Cheering]

16:46.872 --> 16:48.772
Impeach Churchill!

16:48.874 --> 16:54.005
Well, here's one dollar those crooks
aren't gonna get their hands on.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.843
- [Gasping]
- Uh, isn't that illegal?

16:56.949 --> 17:00.646
I don't care if it is illegal.
I'm makir a stand here. Who's with me?

17:00.753 --> 17:03.813
I am! I worked
like a dog for this.

17:03.922 --> 17:06.789
- <i>[Man #1] Yeah!</i>
- <i>[Man #2] Me too.</i>

17:06.892 --> 17:10.349
Oh, you're burning it
all wrong, Seymour.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.260
It's my allowance, Mother,
and I'll burn it the way I want.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.199
Take that, you greedy fat cats.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.236
- Marge, give me your purse.
- Here's $42. That's everything I have.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.829
- Run home and bury it in the yard.
- I love you, Mom.

17:21.940 --> 17:25.068
[Cheering, Clamoring]

17:27.012 --> 17:30.812
Wow, they're hanging
on his every word.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.714
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I hope so.

17:33.819 --> 17:38.256
I thought I made
myself clear in Boston.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.925
[Chuckling]
From now on...

17:42.027 --> 17:44.518
I'm gonna be just like Krusty
and tell it like it is.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.655
Marge, you're getting
a little fat around the old thighs.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.665
- Dad!
- You too, Bart.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.362
Oh, knock it off, Homer.
You're the fattest one in the car.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.769
You didn't have to
tell it like it is, Marge.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.480
<i>I'm proud of you, Krusty.</i>
<i>Oh, sure, I've got material success...</i>

18:06.585 --> 18:08.075
my own show, acres of cars,
a nice microwave oven.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.156
But you're out there on the edge.
You're doir it for the sheer thrill.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.817
And if I wasrt so afraid of clowns,
I'd give you a big hug.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.124
Hey, excuse me, Krusty. We've been
watching you at Moe's all week.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.664
And your credibility
is just-Wow.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.963
- Get to the point, Armani.
- Well, we think you'd be the perfect spokesman...

18:24.069 --> 18:27.004
for our company's new
sports utility vehicle, the Canyonero.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.065
I guess you Wall Street weasels didn't
get the word. Krusty's not for sale.

18:31.176 --> 18:34.043
But you endorse everything.
In fact, this endorsement contract...

18:34.146 --> 18:35.977
comes from your line of legal forms.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.981
It's a quality form.

18:38.083 --> 18:41.211
But those days are behind me.
I don't shill for nobody no more.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.721
Are you sure?
'Cause we're prepared to offer you...

18:44.823 --> 18:47.417
a free, fully-loaded Canyonero.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.926
[Stammering]
Oh, well.

18:53.031 --> 18:56.660
No! Take your corporate blood
wagon and get the hell out.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.929
Are you sure? It's free.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.937
Stop saying that!

19:02.875 --> 19:05.503
[Cheering]

19:05.611 --> 19:08.705
I brought a bag of money
in case he wants us to burn it again.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.977
I hope he tells us to burn our pants.
These things are driving me nuts.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.451
So this afternoon,
two suits come up to me...

19:15.554 --> 19:19.046
and ask me to endorse
some new sports utility vehicle.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.388
- What did you do?
- [Gasping]

19:21.493 --> 19:25.862
- Don't you hate pants?
- I threw those two creeps out on their ass.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.762
[Cheering]

19:28.867 --> 19:33.736
Then they followed me home,
beggir me to take a test drive.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.206
And let me tell you,
talk about roomy.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.837
The Canyonero combines the smooth
handling of a European sports car...

19:41.947 --> 19:44.745
with the rugged drivability
of a sturdy 4x4.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.717
- [Murmuring]
- Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.878
I thought you said
those guys were creeps.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.650
Yeah, but that was
before I got to know 'em.

19:52.758 --> 19:57.855
And I'm tellir you, the Canyonero
is the Cadillac of automobiles.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.954
That's Canyonero.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.863
[Clamoring]

20:03.235 --> 20:05.362
Wait! Where you going?
I still got plenty of beefs.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.439
Fat-free yogurt.
The-The quality of computer porn.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.141
- [Groans]
- I knew I should've gone on first.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.706
I don't get it, Krusty. You said
you would never be a shill again.

20:19.818 --> 20:24.278
[Grunts] I learned something
about myself tonight, kid.

20:24.389 --> 20:28.723
It ain't comedy that's in my blood.
It's selling out.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.761
Come on,
I'll give you a ride home.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.662
Wow. This is roomy.
