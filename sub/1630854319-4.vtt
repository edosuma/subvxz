-He can be very susceptible.
-(Gino laughs)

24:57.771 --> 24:59.608
Why are you laughing?

24:59.641 --> 25:01.612
It's not funny!

25:01.645 --> 25:03.883
This is very serious.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.989
There was, there was
a masked man in leather

25:07.023 --> 25:09.127
running around Central Park,
assaulting people.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.897
Isn't that what you wrote about?

25:10.930 --> 25:13.001
Barbara, please go home.

25:13.035 --> 25:14.938
I-I don't feel well.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.944
-I'm trying to help you.
-No, no, what
you're trying to do,

25:17.978 --> 25:20.950
is to drive a wedge
between Patrick and me.

25:20.984 --> 25:23.188
This is not a secret.

25:23.221 --> 25:26.094
We have been very clear
about this.

25:26.127 --> 25:28.633
Okay, then I guess
I'll just call the police.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.737
Because I'm sure the boys at
the station will be very curious

25:30.770 --> 25:33.175
to know what Patrick gets up to
on his days off.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.112
All right, we're done here.

25:35.145 --> 25:37.818
You're harassing us-- fuck!

25:41.291 --> 25:44.230
In case you hadn't noticed,
I am, um...

25:44.263 --> 25:46.034
unraveling a little bit, okay?

25:46.067 --> 25:48.138
Can you see that?

25:50.744 --> 25:52.647
I don't even know
what I think anymore.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.918
I mean, I don't even know
if I think Patrick's a killer.

25:54.952 --> 25:58.091
But I do know that I see
so much of myself in you.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.864

that I did.

26:00.897 --> 26:03.068

No streetlamps.

27:00.984 --> 27:02.754
No lights.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.390
I can kill in the open.

this free again?

27:10.235 --> 27:11.939

27:11.972 --> 27:13.976
We saw each other
at the hospital.

27:14.010 --> 27:15.880
And I've seen you around.

27:15.914 --> 27:18.351

27:18.385 --> 27:22.159
Why don't you let anyone
see that handsome face?

We're around the same age,

27:45.038 --> 27:47.711

to know, Detective.

27:47.744 --> 27:50.984

and taught me to kill.

I taught myself how to love.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.731

27:57.764 --> 28:00.435

28:00.469 --> 28:02.172

37:49.647 --> 37:52.052
that actually gets you off.

37:52.085 --> 37:54.389
And you love that lie

37:54.423 --> 37:56.628
more than you can love me.

37:56.661 --> 37:58.632
That is simply not true.

37:58.665 --> 38:00.803
It's a relief, really.

38:00.836 --> 38:02.607
This all makes sense now.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.944
The... quiet

38:04.978 --> 38:07.617
around this fucking place.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.787
It's not quiet.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.791
It's shame.

38:12.794 --> 38:14.631
Can't you see
how much I've changed?

38:14.664 --> 38:17.002
How much I'm changing,
how much I can change

38:17.035 --> 38:18.605
since I met you.

38:18.639 --> 38:20.475
I left my wife.

38:20.509 --> 38:22.680
I have come out at work.

38:22.713 --> 38:24.784
Today. That happened today.

38:24.818 --> 38:27.022
I came out in the New York
Police Department.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.527
But why? Why, Patrick?

38:29.561 --> 38:32.032
'Cause you only tell the truth

38:32.065 --> 38:34.036
when you're about to be caught.

38:34.069 --> 38:36.942
That, that's shame.

38:36.975 --> 38:39.514
And I...

38:39.547 --> 38:41.651
I can't...

38:41.685 --> 38:43.454
I can't have it in my life.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.559
It's choking me!

38:45.593 --> 38:48.030
It's choking me.

38:48.064 --> 38:51.003
There's this tightness
in my heart.

38:52.472 --> 38:54.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on?!

38:54.944 --> 38:56.748
I'll call an ambulance...

38:59.419 --> 39:01.490
(sirens wailing)

39:04.162 --> 39:05.933
You know,

39:05.966 --> 39:07.603
I really hate that we're cutting
through here like this.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.707
No, it's like walking
through a bakery.

39:09.741 --> 39:11.811
Even if you don't take a bite,

39:11.845 --> 39:13.849
you still get the sights
and smells.

39:13.882 --> 39:16.086
Jesus Christ, they'll never be
enough for you.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.559
(shushing)

39:27.442 --> 39:29.547
-What the f...?
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:29.581 --> 39:31.450
-We need to follow him.
-Follow him?
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:31.483 --> 39:33.421
Yes, yes, this could be
the guy on all those flyers.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.691
We'll call the police tomorrow

39:34.724 --> 39:35.993
and see what they do
in-fucking-stead.

39:36.026 --> 39:37.062
What if this is the guy
that killed Hans?

39:42.873 --> 39:44.944
(monitor beeping)

39:48.752 --> 39:49.854
Hey.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.092
Hey.

39:55.933 --> 39:57.770
What happened?

39:57.803 --> 40:00.976
You collapsed and passed out.

40:01.010 --> 40:04.016
You've been in and out, but, uh,

40:04.049 --> 40:06.153
the, uh,
the doctors have been great.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.024
SANDOVAL:
You're awake.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.596
Mr. Barelli, I'm Dr. Sandoval.

40:10.629 --> 40:12.198
Good to see you up.

40:12.232 --> 40:15.004
Uh, we're running some tests,
but my thinking is,

40:15.038 --> 40:17.175
this fever can only be
something bacterial.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.146
When you were out, I found
an enlarged lymph node

40:19.179 --> 40:20.616
in one of your armpits.

40:20.649 --> 40:22.018
I-I have to ask.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.089
-Do you live with any cats?
-No.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.093
We don't have cats, why?

40:26.126 --> 40:28.164
What's happened to you,
with the flea bites,

40:28.197 --> 40:31.638
well, they're the hallmarks
of Cat Scratch Fever.

40:31.671 --> 40:33.474
I've started you on antibiotics.

40:33.508 --> 40:36.180
We're gonna keep you right here
where I can see you.

40:36.213 --> 40:37.950
I don't want that fever
spiking back up to 102.

40:37.984 --> 40:39.453
Thanks.

40:52.847 --> 40:54.884
♪ ♪

40:56.688 --> 40:58.759
(siren wailing in distance)

40:59.794 --> 41:02.065
There's power on up there.

41:10.081 --> 41:12.152
(keys jingling)

41:19.132 --> 41:22.138
-Where are we going?
-To see what apartment
he lives in.

41:22.172 --> 41:24.544
There are two of us
and one of him.

41:32.292 --> 41:34.497
Whoop, almost missed you.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.106
Six, please.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.843
You guys just move in?

41:57.877 --> 41:59.947
No, we're visiting a friend.

42:08.130 --> 42:09.967
WHITELY:
Uh-oh.

42:10.001 --> 42:12.072
I have some matches.

42:17.650 --> 42:19.887
I don't really like
small spaces.

42:19.921 --> 42:22.292
Am I safe in here?

42:22.325 --> 42:24.731
I rode in a tank in Vietnam.

42:24.764 --> 42:26.735
Now, that was
a small, dangerous space.

42:26.768 --> 42:28.805
You're a veteran.
Where are you from?

42:28.839 --> 42:30.041
I don't hear an accent,
and I have

42:30.074 --> 42:31.343
a pretty good ear
for these things.

42:31.376 --> 42:33.715
I'm not from anywhere special.

42:35.652 --> 42:37.757
There's really no point
in doing that.

42:37.790 --> 42:39.761
What, are you afraid
of the dark?

42:39.794 --> 42:41.130
(chuckles)

42:41.163 --> 42:43.000
(laughs)

42:43.969 --> 42:46.608
(both chuckling)

42:52.218 --> 42:55.893
Oh, you're smelling
my groceries.

42:55.926 --> 42:57.763
I buy meat that's maybe

42:57.797 --> 42:59.901
a day or two past expiration.

42:59.934 --> 43:01.905
It's cheaper
and it's perfectly fine.

43:05.679 --> 43:07.081
I'm sorry.

43:07.115 --> 43:08.785
I lied to you.

43:08.819 --> 43:12.125
I don't know why I did that.

43:12.158 --> 43:14.630
I hate to lie.

43:14.664 --> 43:18.070
Especially since you know
what's in my bag.
