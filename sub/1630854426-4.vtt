00:43.960 --> 00:47.880
What's French for completely,

00:47.960 --> 00:53.960
unreservedly, intoxicating, and beguiling?

00:58.520 --> 00:59.800
Tell me.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.920
Seductive.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.920
Se-duct-ive.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.000
Seductive.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.880
Seduct-ive. Seductive.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.200
Thanks, Bucura.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.000
Right. Shall we?

01:38.600 --> 01:39.480
Here!

01:39.560 --> 01:40.680
What's this?

01:41.360 --> 01:44.040
It's my favourite book
and I want you to have it.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.240
Aww.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.320
That's so sweet.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.080
I'll treasure it.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.760
Mm-mm.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.720
Happy birthday.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.000
Mm.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.840
This is Captain Suki.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.360
Skipper, this is Amandine.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.120
Too much turmeric, start again.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.560
Where are my fucking clams, Kerry?
Wake up.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.960
-Come on, the carpet shells!
-Chef!

02:39.600 --> 02:42.160
-Good, Jamie, pinch of saffron, yeah?
-Yes, Chef.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.280
-Sorry, Chef, that was me.
-What happened?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.840
My fault, it was my fault,
I'm sorry, Chef.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.760
Clean it up!

02:49.840 --> 02:51.880
Thirty fucking quid on the fucking floor,

02:51.960 --> 02:53.680
you dozy arsehole, what are ya?

02:53.760 --> 02:54.880
-A dozy arsehole, Chef.
-Aye, right.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.760
Start again and that saffron's
coming out your fucking wages.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.880
So where did you two meet?

03:08.680 --> 03:11.000
Oh, well, I work in market research

03:11.080 --> 03:13.640
and Jack was doing the focus group
on his new app

03:13.720 --> 03:15.520
so I suppose we met at work.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.760
Stop saying that …

03:17.840 --> 03:20.120
Of course he's the fucking farmer!

03:25.600 --> 03:27.240
I don't know what's wrong with me

03:27.960 --> 03:30.960
I haven't dropped a pot
in, like, five years.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.800
You need some sleep, Jamie.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.880
Oh, sorry, I'm not meant to--
I thought I was going down.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.440
Oh, I'm going down.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.240
-I'm sorry that was me, I'm so sorry--
-Wow.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.680
I know, I'm sorry, I did just, I'm so…

04:37.760 --> 04:39.320
-You really did.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.440
I'm sorry, I just

04:42.560 --> 04:43.520
Wow.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.040
It's actually getting worse,
I apologise, I am so…

04:47.720 --> 04:49.360
If anyone gets in, I'll say it was me.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.480
Don't worry, so will I.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.800
I really am…

04:57.560 --> 04:58.600
Oh, goodnight.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.520
Yeah, goodnight, and I really am sorry.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.680
Oh, fuck it.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
Do you want a drink?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.920
I, uh, no if it's okay with you,

05:06.040 --> 05:09.120
I'm just gonna slip silently overboard.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.440
Oh, well, you need a drink first.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.720
Thank you.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.440
Um, I'm Jamie by the way,
it's nice to meet you.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.360
You look nervous.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.280
I'm not nervous.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.640
Yes, you are.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.440
I'm not, it's just we're not…

05:48.840 --> 05:52.040
We're not allowed
to, like, mix with the guests.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
Huh? Says who?

05:53.200 --> 05:54.520
It's just the rules.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.880
Whose rules?

05:55.960 --> 05:57.080
Lucien's.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.800
Uh, Lucien works for Jack
and Jack is my fiancé.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.120
Yeah. No, I, uh, sorry.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.640
I've not had a great day.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.960
Congratulations by the way,
he seems really nice.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.000
Have you ever even spoken to him?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.280
Once, he said, "Morning,"
and I said, good morning, sir,

06:13.360 --> 06:16.600
and I'm really basing
my entire considered opinion on that,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.680
but I read people pretty fast so…

06:18.760 --> 06:20.000
How do you read me?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.120
Oh, well, that's the thing,
there's just so--

06:24.200 --> 06:25.440
there's so much, isn't there?

06:25.520 --> 06:27.720
So much to go on, you know, if I--

06:28.200 --> 06:31.200
if I really had to drill it down,
you know, boil down to--

06:31.280 --> 06:35.280
its absolute essence
I'd say you are absolutely, definitely…

06:36.160 --> 06:37.960
French if not possibly Belgian.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.720
No, no, right first time.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.320
-Yeah, you're good at this.
-Yeah.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.680
Okay. Uh…

06:43.920 --> 06:47.360
Uh, coffee, strong, black, no sugar,

06:47.440 --> 06:50.680
allergic to chestnuts and red wine,

06:50.760 --> 06:54.760
uh, loves warm bread and shellfish,
especially oysters,

06:54.840 --> 06:59.240
generally unfussy, dislikes pork,
smoked fish and offal.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.680
Wait, what the fuck,
how the fuck did you do that?

07:02.760 --> 07:04.880
It's magic, see.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.720
Tell me.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.360
Oh, we, uh, no we get given a folder

07:10.440 --> 07:12.640
on every guest who comes on the boat who--

07:12.720 --> 07:14.400
-You're kidding me?
-No, you know, likes,

07:14.480 --> 07:16.960
dislikes, there's a photograph,
it's laminated, everything--

07:17.040 --> 07:18.400
Wait, what is laminated?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.640
Uh, wipe clean.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.040
Ah, laminated.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.320
Ah, laminated, exactly.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.640
Why?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.360
Kitchens are messy.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.720
Maybe it's so that you can have a…

07:33.800 --> 07:35.040
over me.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.440
I genuinely don't know
what to say to that.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.000
What about you?

07:47.080 --> 07:48.520
-Me?
-Yeah, what is your dream?

07:49.160 --> 07:53.080
Me, uh, I wanna own my own restaurant.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.960
Like your boss?

07:55.040 --> 07:57.360
Because he seems a bit like an arsehole.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
Lucien? No, he's a-- he's a genius,

07:59.520 --> 08:02.440
honestly he just wants perfection,
you know?

08:02.520 --> 08:03.760
Are you good enough?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.480
Not yet, but I will be.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.480
How do you know?

08:08.360 --> 08:12.840
It's hard to-- Well, like,
so when I got this job, okay,

08:12.920 --> 08:15.000
this job was the absolute dream for me,

08:15.080 --> 08:17.240
like, to work for Lucien, it really was,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.920
but there's one problem, I get seasick.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.720
-Right, I do.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.960
So, uh, I went to the local swings,

08:25.040 --> 08:28.000
like, the park, all right,
and I would go to the roundabout

08:28.080 --> 08:31.440
and I would sit on the roundabout
for four hours a day,

08:31.520 --> 08:34.400
every day just going round
and round and round,

08:34.480 --> 08:38.880
four hours a day, every day
for two weeks and then bang, cured.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.600
I like your dream.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.880
-So do I.
-It's a good dream.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.640
What are you reading?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.880
What's the… in the book?

08:56.640 --> 08:58.360
Moby Dick.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
Ah!

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
Have you read it?

09:00.600 --> 09:03.520
I haven't actually,
I've seen the film, Gregory Peck, right?

09:03.640 --> 09:04.960
-And the whale, obviously.
-Mm-mm.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.160
And you've heard the stories,
Gregory Peck,

09:07.240 --> 09:09.040
lovely, you know, salt of the earth

09:09.120 --> 09:11.240
but the whale, nightmare, absolute diva,

09:11.320 --> 09:12.760
wouldn't come out of its trailer,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.240
you know, all that sort of nonsense.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.320
Why did the old Persians
hold the sea holy?

09:22.360 --> 09:23.280
Sorry?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.720
Why did the Greeks
give it a separate deity?

09:26.240 --> 09:28.760
Surely all this is not without meaning?

09:33.600 --> 09:34.640
Um…

09:36.760 --> 09:37.760
Uh…

09:39.880 --> 09:44.200
"We ourselves see
in all rivers and oceans."

09:44.840 --> 09:48.160
"It is the image
of the ungraspable phantom of life.

09:48.760 --> 09:53.520
-This is the key to it all."
-"This is the key to it all."

10:02.160 --> 10:03.880
So, what are you gonna call it?

10:05.280 --> 10:06.400
Call what?

10:08.480 --> 10:09.600
Your restaurant?

10:12.520 --> 10:13.720
Fucking hell!

10:14.040 --> 10:17.400
-Oh, my--
-Oh, my fucking God. Fuck!

10:19.640 --> 10:21.080
I-- Did you see that?

10:21.520 --> 10:22.760
What the fuck?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.360
-What the fuck just happened?
-I don't know

10:26.440 --> 10:27.440
Amandine?

10:28.640 --> 10:31.000
-Jack?
-Everything okay?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.240
Uh, it's fine.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.400
-Who's this?
-Uh, this is…

10:34.480 --> 10:36.640
Hi, I'm-- I'm Jamie, we just saw…

10:36.720 --> 10:38.320
You know, I'm going to bed.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.600
Are you coming Jack?

10:39.640 --> 10:42.200
-Sure.
-Yeah. Oh, uh, nice to meet you, Jamie.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.440
-Night, Jamie.
-Goodnight, sir.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.120
Jamie, a word.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.280
-Yes, Chef?
-Pack your bags.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.880
-What?
-You heard.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.560
-Why? What'd I do?
-You touched a guest

11:30.640 --> 11:31.520
and not just any guest,

11:31.600 --> 11:34.360
no, no, no, no, the fiancée of the cunt

11:34.440 --> 11:37.000
that owns this fucking boat,
you came onto her!

11:37.080 --> 11:40.080
-What?
-This is my show, you prick, my show!

11:40.160 --> 11:41.160
-Okay!
-My reputation!

11:41.240 --> 11:43.360
Okay. Look, let me explain, okay?

11:43.440 --> 11:44.280
That isn't what happened!

11:44.360 --> 11:46.520
I don't-- I don't want to know
what happened!

11:46.600 --> 11:48.960
All I'm interested in is what happens now!

11:49.040 --> 11:51.680
-Why do you have to shout all the time?
-What?

11:51.760 --> 11:54.080
And swear, I mean, fuck, I get it,

11:54.160 --> 11:55.800
that, you know,
everything has to be perfect,

11:55.880 --> 11:57.680
but I swear to God
when I'm in your position,

11:57.760 --> 12:00.720
-I'll hear people out, I won't just--
-Right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.640
When you are in my position?

12:09.120 --> 12:12.160
You in my pos--

12:12.240 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.480
The-- The oolong cured trout
with wild sorrel,

12:17.560 --> 12:19.280
but not just any old oolong,

12:19.360 --> 12:21.680
no, it's gotta be Ti Kuan Feng,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.680
grown off the western front of Mount Fuji

12:24.760 --> 12:26.200
except have you ever noticed,

12:26.280 --> 12:28.520
have you ever noticed
that when the elevated tannin

12:28.600 --> 12:30.920
reacts to the oxalic acid in the sorrel,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.760
it leads to a slightly unpleasant,
slightly bitter, slightly tiny note of,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.160
and I hope you don't mind me
saying this, cat piss!

12:38.640 --> 12:41.520
Fucking PG Tips, mate, problem solved.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.000
Ah, fucking-- Ow!

12:56.760 --> 13:01.520
…for these people here…

13:01.600 --> 13:02.840
you got the wrong day.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.240
That's my number.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.680
Welcome home, Jamie.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.800
What type of whale?

14:37.840 --> 14:39.280
A sperm whale?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.240
A fin whale?

14:40.320 --> 14:42.360
-A long finned pilot?
-I don't know,

14:42.440 --> 14:45.880
but it rose up, it looked at us,

14:46.520 --> 14:47.880
and sunk back down.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.840
Okay. Well…

14:55.760 --> 14:57.160
that's amazing.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.720
You see whales are mammals,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.040
they live in the deep,

15:01.120 --> 15:02.960
but they need to surface to breathe,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.000
and one of these did that near you

15:05.080 --> 15:07.800
and because of that,
you're now thinking of chucking Gail?

15:07.880 --> 15:09.360
I'm not thinking of chucking Gail.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.600
-This girl…
-Amandine.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.040
-She's getting married.
-I know.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.760
-To a billionaire.
-A billionaire's son, right?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.640
Jack's never done
a day's work in his life,

15:16.720 --> 15:18.920
-he hasn't even got a job.
-He doesn't need one.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.600
Would you work if you didn't have to?

15:20.680 --> 15:22.360
I think she's having second thoughts.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.240
Right. Well, who cares?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.440
You're never gonna see her again.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.640
She texted me.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.400
-When?
-Last night.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.600
-How's she got your number?
-I gave it to her.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.840
-Why?
-I don't know.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.120
What'd it say?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.840
It said, "Have a question."

15:48.040 --> 15:51.240
Okay. Well, are you gonna answer?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.200
I already did.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.720
Can I ask you a question?

16:05.520 --> 16:08.120
-Yeah.
-You love Gail.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.320
That isn't a question.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.560
-Do you love Gail?
-I do, yes.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.120
You, what, you want to be with Gail?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.600
I do, I want to be with Gail.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.160
Good, so you text her back

16:18.240 --> 16:19.520
and you tell her you've got the flu.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.760
-I've got the flu?
-You've got the flu.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.120
I've got the flu.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.840
Mr. Jamie?

16:40.080 --> 16:40.960
Yes.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.240
Miss Dubois will see you in her suite.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.760
Her suite?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.000
Thank you.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.640
Hi.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.200
Hello.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.360
You came.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.200
You said you had a question.

17:16.320 --> 17:17.920
Do you play Scrabble?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.560
Is that the question?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.760
No, it's not.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.520
Well, you pick first.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.960
Okay, sure, let's-- All right.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.800
Fine, let's… play Scrabble.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.520
Why did you get fired?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.480
Is that the question?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.080
No.

17:46.960 --> 17:51.480
It's a… high pressure industry,
fast turnover.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.560
-Did Jack get you fired?
-I got me fired, I broke the rules.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.960
Wow, a double letter score

18:01.040 --> 18:02.760
and a Scrabble.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.320
-Sixty-three.
-Okay.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.080
Do you have a girlfriend?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.200
-Is that the question?
-No.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.560
Yes.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.240
Does she know you're here?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.200
Does Jack know you're here?

18:21.520 --> 18:23.480
Polio, seven.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.320
Females, 83.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.800
No, he doesn't.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.080
But he'll find out.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.920
How?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.040
He owns this hotel.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.440
This is Jack's hotel?

18:38.520 --> 18:41.800
His father's, or both, I'm not sure.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.720
But they have cameras everywhere.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.520
So, what's her name?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.480
-Who?
-Your sweetheart.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.920
Her name's unimportant.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.880
Well, it's important to her.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.880
Mellow, 23.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.240
Why did you give me your number?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.560
Is that the question?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
-No.
-I was just being friendly.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.080
-Friendly.
-Look, I wasn't really thinking.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.680
I'd just been fired. I'd been head-butted.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.800
It was-- What's that?

19:14.440 --> 19:18.240
"Fletch",
from the French "fleche" meaning arrow.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.040
It's an English verb.
It means, uh, to provide the feathers…

19:22.080 --> 19:23.240
What's the question?

19:32.640 --> 19:34.440
The question is this…

19:38.720 --> 19:41.200
Do you believe in signs?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.320
Signs?

19:45.920 --> 19:48.560
My grandmother said life is suffering,

19:50.320 --> 19:53.240
torment, agony, havoc,

19:53.320 --> 19:55.880
chaos, confusion, and then death.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.880
But in the darkness,
there are pockets of light,

20:00.800 --> 20:01.960
little glimpses.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.320
You must look for signs,
clues, intimations…

20:06.400 --> 20:08.480
Can I stop you there?
Is this about the whale?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.200
Because here's the thing about whales.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.880
Whales are mammals.
They have to surface, to breathe.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.400
That's all it was.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.000
It-- Do you know what?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.720
I think I should go.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.320
Wait, but the game is not over yet.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.040
I think it is, okay?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.800
I don't believe in signs.
I'm in love with Gail, okay?

20:25.880 --> 20:27.200
-Like a storm?
-What?

20:27.280 --> 20:28.760
-A storm at sea?
-Eh?

20:28.800 --> 20:30.400
As in tempest?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.880
No, as in Gail,

20:32.960 --> 20:35.440
my girlfriend who I love, all right.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.200
P.S. Also you're getting married

20:37.280 --> 20:38.560
or maybe you're not, I don't know.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.080
That's your--
that's none of my business, all right?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.280
Thank you for the game.
This has been really weird.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.080
-Good night.
-So you're going to ignore it.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.800
It wasn't a sign.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.320
It was a whale.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.560
No, not that sign. This one.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.560
What one?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.400
-This.
-Where?

20:54.200 --> 20:55.400
Here.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.960
Okay, sure.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
Let's do this then, shall we?

21:03.800 --> 21:05.280
What have we got? We've got polio,

21:06.040 --> 21:10.040
fem, emerald, uh, females with polio,

21:10.080 --> 21:14.440
mellow females with polio,
fletch, emeralds, is that it?

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
Look again.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.920
-I can't see.
-But it's right there.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.800
Nevertheless, I can't see it.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.320
Okay, watch.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.000
And so after
only the briefest of courtships…

22:18.040 --> 22:20.560
…the male and female
consummate their relationship.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.520
Hey, how was your girls' night?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.800
The defeated male can only look on.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.440
It was-- it was fun.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.560
Did you eat?
Because this, uh, sashimi is outstanding.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.040
Yeah. Give me a minute.

22:47.680 --> 22:51.600
Uh, I was, uh…

22:57.560 --> 22:59.480
Oh. Hmm.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.200
What's this?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.720
I found it in the bathroom, in the bin.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.600
Whose is it?

23:11.120 --> 23:12.440
Whose thong is it?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.040
The cleaner?

23:16.840 --> 23:17.760
Don't…

23:17.840 --> 23:19.400
The fucking cleaner? Bullshit!

23:19.480 --> 23:20.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Amandine!

23:21.040 --> 23:23.320
Look me in the eye, Jack. Whose is it?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.320
I'm…

23:33.240 --> 23:34.920
I'm so, so sorry.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.520
It was a total fucking mistake.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.960
You tricked me.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.520
Goodbye, Jack.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.760
Wait, wait, wait.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.720
Can we at least talk--
can we talk about this?

24:13.120 --> 24:14.440
I've met someone.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
I'm meeting him in 30 minutes.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.240
What are you doing?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.360
Ah, man. What are you doing?

25:11.480 --> 25:12.680
Hi.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.600
Hi.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.920
Do you wanna get a drink?

25:32.360 --> 25:34.240
I've got £2.65.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.680
I have ten euros.

25:38.760 --> 25:39.880
Okay.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.360
This is insane.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.520
I don't know you.
I don't know anything about you.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.880
How do I take my coffee?

25:57.720 --> 25:59.480
Strong, black, no sugar.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.200
-Allergies?
-Chestnuts and red wine.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.360
What do I love?

26:03.920 --> 26:07.000
Warm bread, shellfish.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.960
-Especially?
-Especially oysters

26:09.040 --> 26:12.080
but you won't touch pork,
smoked fish, or offal.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.880
There's something else
you need to know about me.

26:15.960 --> 26:16.800
What's that?

26:16.880 --> 26:18.120
I'm pregnant.
