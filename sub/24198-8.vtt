<b>They're about what kind of moral</b>

{\an1}<b>Because according to experts,</b>
<b>torture simply doesn't work.</b>

05:40.735 --> 05:42.437

05:48.510 --> 05:50.946

<b>was just to give him</b>

06:47.268 --> 06:48.536

06:50.005 --> 06:52.741
<b>what kind of country</b>
<b>do we want to be?</b>

<b>This is about the monarchy.</b>

09:21.902 --> 09:24.605
<b>-Are they inbred?</b>
<b>-No.</b>

09:24.638 --> 09:26.507
<b>-Isn't there inbreeding?</b>
<b>-Not anymore.</b>

09:26.540 --> 09:29.410
<b>Not anymore. There was a bit of</b>
<b>inbreeding back in the day.</b>

09:29.443 --> 09:30.611
<b>Way back.</b>

09:30.644 --> 09:32.479
<b>That would account for</b>
<b>Charles' ears, I assume.</b>

09:32.513 --> 09:33.714
{\an3}<b>Aww.</b>

09:33.747 --> 09:35.916
<b>We all agree -- No one</b>
<b>wants Charles, do they?</b>

09:35.950 --> 09:38.552
<b>We all want to go</b>
<b>straight to William.</b>
<b>Yes, I do. No, no.</b>

09:38.586 --> 09:40.221
<b>That's not the way</b>
<b>the system works.</b>

09:40.254 --> 09:42.756
<b>If the Queen dies and Charles</b>
<b>dies a week later...</b>

09:42.790 --> 09:44.391
{\an1}<b>You're gonna be like --</b>
<b>You're trying to be...</b>

09:44.425 --> 09:45.659
<b>That is just wrong.</b>

09:45.693 --> 09:47.595
<b>I'm not that excited</b>
<b>about Charles.</b>

09:47.628 --> 09:49.363
<b>I like William,</b>
<b>and I gotta say</b>

09:49.396 --> 09:51.565
<b>George isn't living up</b>
<b>to my expectations.</b>

09:51.599 --> 09:53.767
<b>I've been watching him.</b>
<b>I don't think he's gonna</b>
<b>make a good king.</b>

09:53.801 --> 09:55.102
<b>You don't think</b>
<b>he's got what it takes.</b>

09:55.135 --> 09:56.537
<b>I don't think George</b>
<b>has got what it takes.</b>

09:56.570 --> 09:59.240
{\an1}<b>Charles, in some respects,</b>
<b>he's done exceptionally well.</b>

09:59.273 --> 10:00.608
<b>Look at</b>
<b>the environment.</b>

10:00.641 --> 10:02.443
<b>What did he do</b>
<b>for the environment?</b>

10:02.476 --> 10:04.445
<b>The lawn mowers and the</b>
<b>strimmers at Buckingham Palace,</b>

10:04.478 --> 10:07.214
<b>they run on biodiesel because</b>
<b>of the Prince of Wales,</b>

10:07.248 --> 10:09.116
<b>along with his</b>
<b>Aston Martin collection.</b>

10:09.149 --> 10:10.684
{\an3}<b>The Royal Train</b>
<b>runs on biodiesel.</b>

10:10.718 --> 10:11.819
<b>The Royal Train?</b>

10:11.852 --> 10:13.854
<b>Of course. You've got to</b>
<b>have a Royal Train.</b>

10:13.888 --> 10:15.923
<b>And we're not wasting too much</b>
<b>money on these people?</b>

10:15.956 --> 10:17.091
<b>They have their own train?</b>

10:17.124 --> 10:18.425
<b>The Queen does travel with</b>

10:18.459 --> 10:20.327
{\an3}<b>all of the rest</b>
<b>of the population.</b>

10:20.361 --> 10:22.429
<b>She does not. I never</b>
<b>saw her down on the tube.</b>

10:22.463 --> 10:24.965
<b>She never got on and went,</b>
<b>"Oh, I'm on the Central line.</b>

10:24.999 --> 10:26.667
<b>I need to be on</b>
<b>the Northern line."</b>

10:26.700 --> 10:27.968
<b>She's never done that.</b>

10:28.002 --> 10:30.137
<b>Is it true that the Queen</b>
<b>drinks four cocktails a day?</b>

10:30.171 --> 10:32.840
{\an1}<b>If things get really tough,</b>
<b>she'll have a large cocktail.</b>

10:32.873 --> 10:35.075
<b>So it gets tough</b>
<b>four times a day, does it?</b>

10:35.109 --> 10:36.810
<b>-Well, it's timed. It's timed.</b>
<b>-We don't know.</b>

10:36.844 --> 10:38.712
<b>Between what she likes to drink</b>
<b>and when she drinks.</b>

10:38.746 --> 10:40.781
<b>No, no. She gets up</b>
<b>in the morning and has one.</b>

10:40.814 --> 10:42.449
<b>-That's how you do it.</b>
<b>-No, no, no, no, no.</b>

10:42.483 --> 10:44.084
<b>You ease into the day.</b>
<b>'Cause she has to get over</b>

10:44.118 --> 10:46.320
<b>the hangover from the four</b>
<b>that she drank...</b>

10:46.353 --> 10:47.521
<b>Four cocktails a day.</b>

10:47.555 --> 10:50.824
<b>That means that she's</b>
<b>a complete alcoholic.</b>

10:50.858 --> 10:54.028
<b>If you said she is,</b>
<b>I'm back on with the monarchy.</b>

10:54.061 --> 10:55.563
<b>I'm back in.</b>

10:55.596 --> 10:59.300
<b> </b><b> <i>I like that the Queen gets</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>a tad pissed before tea time.</i> </b>

10:59.333 --> 11:01.936
<b> </b><b> <i>It's just shows she's</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>a lot like the rest of us.</i> </b>

11:01.969 --> 11:03.604
<b> </b><b> <i>I mean, these people</i> </b>

11:03.637 --> 11:05.739
<b> </b><b> <i>aren't really better</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>than anyone else.</i> </b>

11:05.773 --> 11:07.007
{\an1}<b> </b><b> <i>Just because they're a product</i> </b>

11:07.041 --> 11:09.743
<b> </b><b> <i>of 1,000 years of</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>royal inter-[bleep].</i> </b>

11:09.777 --> 11:14.815
<b>Why is one person's life more</b>
<b>important than anyone else?</b>

11:14.849 --> 11:17.184
<b>Why should we revere</b>
<b>these people</b>

11:17.218 --> 11:19.887
<b>just because they were</b>
<b>born into this family?</b>

11:19.920 --> 11:23.624
{\an1}<b>The monarchy are very much</b>
<b>trying to remove that reverence.</b>

11:23.657 --> 11:25.960
<b>Because it is</b>
<b>old-fashioned.</b>

11:25.993 --> 11:28.128
<b>-I think it's rather nice.</b>
<b>-I like it.</b>

11:28.162 --> 11:30.731
{\an1}<b>But we don't count for the</b>
<b>majority of the population.</b>

11:30.764 --> 11:32.833
<b>But taxpayers pay their --</b>

11:32.867 --> 11:35.035
{\an3}<b>No. No. Oh. No.</b>

11:35.069 --> 11:38.305
<b>-No? All right.</b>
<b>-Ah. We're gonna go blows here.</b>

11:38.339 --> 11:40.474
<b>Okay. Oh. All right.</b>
<b>Fisticuffs.</b>

11:40.508 --> 11:42.576
<b>Have I offended</b>
<b>your honor, good man?</b>

11:42.610 --> 11:44.445
<b>Can you hold my medal?</b>
<b>Because...</b>

11:44.478 --> 11:46.146
<b>-No.</b>
<b>-Are you gonna punch him?</b>

11:46.180 --> 11:48.015
{\an3}<b>No, no, no.</b>
<b>We're gentlemen here.</b>

11:48.048 --> 11:49.783
<b>In America, you'd say,</b>
<b>"Hold my gold."</b>

11:49.817 --> 11:52.086
<b>The biggest misconception</b>
<b>is that the British public</b>

11:52.119 --> 11:55.623
<b>are shelling out hand over fist</b>
<b>and say, "Nice, old lady.</b>

11:55.656 --> 11:57.825
<b>Let's feed her and</b>
<b>clothe her and home her."</b>

11:57.858 --> 11:59.326
{\an3}<b>And that's not</b>
<b>the case at all.</b>

11:59.360 --> 12:01.428
<b>So when we understand --</b>

12:01.462 --> 12:03.430
<b>Yeah. I really want to shove</b>
<b>one of those in my mouth.</b>

12:03.464 --> 12:04.798
<b>Have one.</b>

12:04.832 --> 12:08.235
{\an1}<b>The trouble is, a lot of people</b>
<b>in Britain think that, too.</b>

12:08.269 --> 12:09.904
{\an3}<b>It's not just going</b>
<b>to the treasury</b>

12:09.937 --> 12:11.906
<b>and shoveling money</b>
<b>in the Queen's handbag.</b>

12:11.939 --> 12:13.174
<b>It doesn't work that way.</b>

12:13.207 --> 12:14.642
<b> </b><b> <i>And they may have a point.</i> </b>

12:14.675 --> 12:16.210
{\an1}<b> </b><b> <i>While some say the royal family</i> </b>

12:16.243 --> 12:19.113
<b> </b><b> <i>costs Britain about</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>£350 million a year,</i> </b>

12:19.146 --> 12:21.081
<b> </b><b> <i>they actually boost</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>annual tourism revenue</i> </b>

{\an1}<b> </b><b> <i>A half a billion pounds? I say!</i> </b>

12:26.387 --> 12:29.990
<b> </b><b> <i>That's a lot of</i> </b>
<b> </b><b> <i>rubbish souvenir plates.</i> </b>

12:30.024 --> 12:31.492
<b>What do we think</b>
<b>of Meghan Markle?</b>

12:31.525 --> 12:32.693
<b>Fantastic!</b>

12:32.726 --> 12:36.397
<b>You've got an American</b>
<b>biracial actress,</b>

12:36.430 --> 12:37.731
{\an1}<b>who's a divorcée,</b>

12:37.765 --> 12:40.868
{\an1}<b>and she's marrying the world's</b>
<b>most eligible royal bachelor.</b>

12:40.901 --> 12:42.670
<b>I actually know</b>
<b>her ex-husband.</b>

12:42.703 --> 12:44.572
<b>Yeah, but she'd had</b>
<b>a few relationships.</b>

12:44.605 --> 12:46.640
<b>She's been divorced</b>
<b>from him for a couple --</b>

12:46.674 --> 12:49.410
<b>Oh, she's been through the mill.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</b>

12:49.443 --> 12:51.445
<b>Think what she's</b>
<b>gonna give to charity.</b>

12:51.478 --> 12:53.681
{\an1}<b>Because that's one of</b>
<b>the important things.</b>

12:53.714 --> 12:55.516
{\an1}<b>Well, I do like the princesses</b>

12:55.549 --> 12:57.351
<b>always do the</b>
<b>charitable endeavors.</b>

12:57.384 --> 12:59.553
<b>That was the thing that</b>
<b>you couldn't fault Diana on,</b>

12:59.587 --> 13:02.089
{\an1}<b>the amount of money that she</b>
<b>made for different charities.</b>

13:02.122 --> 13:03.557
<b>And that's why I do think</b>

13:03.591 --> 13:06.360
<b>the royal family</b>
<b>does play a good role.</b>

13:06.393 --> 13:08.429
{\an3}<b>Ah. There's</b>
<b>a beginning point.</b>

13:08.462 --> 13:10.764
<b>I'm not as rude</b>
<b>as you think.</b>

13:10.798 --> 13:13.701
<b>And how often do you reckon</b>
<b>Philip and the Queen have sex?</b>

13:13.734 --> 13:15.669
<b>Just ballpark.</b>
<b>What do you reckon?</b>

13:15.703 --> 13:17.238
<b>-Now?</b>
<b>-Yeah, now.</b>

13:17.271 --> 13:20.975
<b>Oh. I don't know. With their</b>

13:21.008 --> 13:22.543
<b>I reckon he gives her one</b>
<b>at Christmas.</b>

13:22.576 --> 13:24.411
<b>Well, you've got to have</b>
<b>a little Christmas shag</b>

13:24.445 --> 13:26.080

<b>When you're a parent, everyone</b>

<b>Everyone thinks they know</b>
<b>what's best for your child.</b>

14:06.309 --> 14:09.012
<b>Well, the state of Utah</b>
<b>recently passed a law</b>

14:09.045 --> 14:11.314
<b>telling those people</b>

<b>The governor of Utah</b>
<b>signing a bill into law Friday</b>

14:17.587 --> 14:19.389
{\an1}<b>that gives parents the freedom</b>

{\an1}<b>to allow their children to do</b>
<b>more activities independently</b>

14:22.993 --> 14:25.762
<b>without being penalized</b>
<b>for child neglect --</b>

14:25.795 --> 14:28.165
<b>like walking to school,</b>
<b>playing outside,</b>

14:28.198 --> 14:30.100
<b>and staying home alone.</b>

14:30.133 --> 14:34.104
<b>Utah needed a law to stop people</b>
<b>from calling Child Services</b>

14:36.473 --> 14:38.942
<b>That's insane!</b>

<b>When I was young, I used to</b>

14:41.845 --> 14:43.680
<b>I'd ride my bike around</b>
<b>with my mates.</b>

14:43.713 --> 14:45.382
<b>My parents didn't know</b>
<b>where I was.</b>

14:45.415 --> 14:47.450
<b>They never even asked!</b>

14:47.484 --> 14:49.820
<b>They didn't even notice</b>
<b>if I came home</b>

14:49.853 --> 14:52.789
<b>or even -- even told me</b>
<b>that they loved me.</b>

14:52.823 --> 14:55.859

15:06.369 --> 15:09.039
<b>[ Laughter ]</b>

15:09.072 --> 15:12.242
{\an1}<b>The law is in reaction to the</b>

<b>who hover over</b>
<b>their kids' every move.</b>

15:14.644 --> 15:16.947
<b>And that's very much</b>

15:16.980 --> 15:18.648
<b>In other countries,</b>
<b>parents do things</b>

15:18.682 --> 15:21.551
<b>that would make Americans</b>
<b>lose their [bleep] minds.</b>

<b>In Scandinavian countries,</b>

<b>In Japan, kids ride the subway</b>

15:39.569 --> 15:43.874
<b>You just have loads of fun.</b>
<b>You can't do anything bad.</b>

15:43.907 --> 15:45.542
<b>They'll say, "No,</b>

<b>I'd let my kid play there</b>

<b>Because there's</b>
<b>a couple of his friends</b>

16:06.563 --> 16:10.133
<b>I wouldn't mind</b>
<b>if they were burn victims.</b>

16:10.167 --> 16:12.602
<b>I know what it means to be</b>
<b>an overprotective parent.</b>

16:12.636 --> 16:14.070
<b>I'm guilty of it, too.</b>

16:14.104 --> 16:16.807
<b>We drive ourselves crazy</b>

<b>There's nothing you can do</b>
<b>to avoid that.</b>

16:28.919 --> 16:31.054
<b>You will screw up badly.</b>

16:31.087 --> 16:33.023
{\an1}<b>And your kid will resent it.</b>

16:33.056 --> 16:34.324
<b>But that's great.</b>

16:34.357 --> 16:36.393
<b>You want them</b>
<b>to resent you enough</b>

16:36.426 --> 16:39.729
<b>just so they move out</b>
<b>and get their own place.</b>

16:39.763 --> 16:44.534
<b>But not so much that</b>
<b>they totally ruin their lives.</b>

16:44.568 --> 16:47.571
{\an1}<b>So how do you strike a balance?</b>

16:47.604 --> 16:49.239
{\an1}<b>Well, it's up to each parent.</b>

16:49.272 --> 16:52.342
<b>There's no right way</b>
