[Archie]
Previously onRiverdale...

00:02.872 --> 00:04.917
[Hiram] I'm excited to fulfill
a lifelong dream of mine

00:04.961 --> 00:07.050
and announce my candidacy
for mayor.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.139
Our father needed help.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.662
"Our father"?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.316
Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. DuPont.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.752
I wanted to
talk to you about

00:13.796 --> 00:15.580
the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series.

00:15.624 --> 00:16.538
You didn't write it.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.235
You're very lucky

00:18.279 --> 00:20.063
I don't take you
to the Headmaster

00:20.107 --> 00:21.673
and get you expelled.

00:21.717 --> 00:22.631
Are you okay?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.024
I'm sorry, Jughead,

00:24.067 --> 00:26.461
that I couldn't help you.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.681
I will be taking over
Mr. Chipping's seminar.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.770
[Cheryl] Aunt Cricket?
Uncle Bedford?

00:31.814 --> 00:33.468
-[Uncle Bedford] Cheryl.
-Uncle Bedford?

00:33.511 --> 00:37.167
You are going away
for a long, long time, Cheryl.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.951
Let go of her, you monster.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.040
[grunting]

00:40.083 --> 00:41.258
-[effort grunt]
-[groans]

00:42.172 --> 00:43.521
You want to fight me again?

00:43.565 --> 00:45.480
Don't you need to put
your mask on first?

00:46.394 --> 00:47.917
We got to get him
to a hospital.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.397
-[moans]
-[cell phone dials]

00:50.441 --> 00:52.269
[Jughead] Thanksgiving.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.358
The time of year
when friends and family

00:54.402 --> 00:55.881
gather to eat turkey,

00:55.925 --> 00:57.274
watch the big game,

00:57.318 --> 00:59.624
and give thanks
for all that they have.

01:04.716 --> 01:08.068
But for Archie, this year was
all about what he'd lost.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.374
It was the first Thanksgiving
without his father.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.376
The void that Fred Andrews left

01:12.420 --> 01:15.727
was as cold as the winds
blowing through the town.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.468
[sighs]

01:17.512 --> 01:19.209
And while Archie was thinking
of ways to give back,

01:19.253 --> 01:23.300
Riverdale's new mayor was
grabbing all that he could.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.607
Hiram Lodge had
run unopposed,

01:25.650 --> 01:29.263
allowing him to ascend
to power virtually overnight.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.527
Meanwhile, across town, at Riverdale General Hospital,

01:32.570 --> 01:35.312
-a different family gathering
was taking place.
-[EKG beeping]

01:35.356 --> 01:39.534
For the Dickenson crime clan,
the only dish on the Thanksgiving menu was revenge.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.624
Now that our boy Dodger
is stable,

01:42.667 --> 01:45.279
we'll find whoever did
this to him.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.108
Guy from the community center.
Got to be.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.241
What community center?

01:51.285 --> 01:53.417
Who the hell are you
talking about?

01:53.461 --> 01:55.724
[Jughead] Weather forecasters
were calling for
an epic ice storm,

01:55.767 --> 01:58.161
and you could literally feel
the temperature dropping.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.728
Mija.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.600
Hey, you were missed
this morning.

02:02.644 --> 02:06.126
Oh, wait,
was your inauguration today?

02:06.169 --> 02:07.562
[chuckles]

02:07.605 --> 02:10.130
Well, you can make it up to me
tomorrow night.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.958
I made reservations at
the Sweetwater Country Club.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.439
I'm helping Archie at
the community center.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.138
Yeah,
Archie's community center...

02:18.181 --> 02:22.620
Wasn't a man found
bleeding out, on the verge
of death, right in front of it?

02:24.100 --> 02:27.321
Just terrible what's going on
in that part of town.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.844
It's a real problem.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.152
Well...

02:32.195 --> 02:33.501
You make sure you wish

02:33.544 --> 02:36.330
Archie a very
happy Thanksgiving for me.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.159
[footsteps receding]

02:39.202 --> 02:42.118
[Archie] All right, everyone,
bring it in. Come on!

02:42.162 --> 02:43.598
Hustle up, hustle up.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.951
All right, look.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.823
We know some of you guys have
nowhere to go for Thanksgiving.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.565
So, Munroe and I,
we're gonna keep
the center open tomorrow.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.742
We're gonna have hot meals
with all the fixings.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.049
[all cheering]

03:00.092 --> 03:02.225
-Seriously? You guys
are cooking?
-Hell, yeah.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.184
-And my mom.
-And grandma.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.012
So tell your friends
there's an open-door policy.
Everyone is invited.

03:07.056 --> 03:10.102
All right.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.671
[Mr. DuPont] And with that,
the seminar is adjourned for
the remainder of the week.

03:13.715 --> 03:17.327
I hope you all have a restful
and productive

03:17.371 --> 03:18.415
Thanksgiving break.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.851
[Jughead exhales]

03:19.895 --> 03:24.204
Mr. DuPont, before you go,
I was wondering...

03:24.247 --> 03:27.859
I was wondering if you had
any more information about why
Mr. Chipping killed himself.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.514
Alcoholism.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.820
Drove him to the edge.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.475
Rupert had many demons,
I'm afraid.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.824
Well, he didn't leave a note.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.565
There hasn't been much of
an investigation.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.002
The family's request.
And it was clearly a suicide.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.786
You saw it with your own eyes.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.269
Mr. Chipping didn't come to you
to talk about me, did he?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.923
No. Why would he have?

03:47.966 --> 03:50.882
-Well, because I shared with--
-That ridiculous notion...

03:50.926 --> 03:51.970
[scoffs]

03:52.014 --> 03:53.711
Of your grandfather

03:53.755 --> 03:56.497
writing the original
Baxter Brothers novel?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.542
He never bought it up.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.153
And might I make a suggestion,
Mr. Jones?

04:01.197 --> 04:04.809
That you forget
about this delusion
over the Thanksgiving break.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.813
Now if you will excuse me.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.863
[Jughead]
Are you still gonna make it?

04:14.906 --> 04:16.865
Even with this biblical
ice storm that
they're predicting?

04:16.908 --> 04:19.259
Jug, I don't care what my mom
or the weatherman are saying.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.305
There's zero chance that I'm
not seeing you this weekend.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.351
[Jughead] Well, then hurry up
and get here already.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.004
I need your help
with something.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.790
Oh! You mean writing your
Baxter Brothers sample?

04:28.833 --> 04:32.054
Well, I am on a deadline
and that's the reason
I'm hunkering down,

04:32.097 --> 04:35.623
but also, considering
you and I are going to be
the only ones on campus,

04:35.666 --> 04:37.668
I figured it would be
the perfect time

04:37.712 --> 04:41.585
to do a little sleuthing into
Chipping's death.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.892
Because believe me,
no one else is doing it.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.328
Hmm.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.897
Conspiracy theories and
a murder mystery to solve.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.595
Sounds like a
romantic getaway to me.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.337
All right. I love you,
see you later.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.302
[Cheryl] Did you hear
the good news, T.T.?

05:02.345 --> 05:06.393
There's a category-four ice
storm heading towards Riverdale
like the wrath of God.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.004
How is that good news, Cheryl?

05:09.047 --> 05:13.182
Well, whilst the rest
of Riverdale sits down
to give thanks,

05:13.225 --> 05:16.272
we'll be dumping Bedford's body
in Sweetwater River.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.361
Just before it freezes over.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.538
By the time spring thaw comes
around, the salmon will
have gobbled up his eyes.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.541
[sighs]

05:25.412 --> 05:26.674
Toni.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.025
What is it, my sweet?

05:30.068 --> 05:33.594
I feel like somebody is
watching me all the time.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.639
Whatever guilt
you're experiencing,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
free yourself of it.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.342
You didn't set out
to do anyone any harm.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.039
Remember?

05:44.082 --> 05:46.824
You were defending me
and I love you for it.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.222
Feast your eyes on this, boys.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.180
A true Thanksgiving cornucopia.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.443
Wow!

05:56.486 --> 05:58.445
Ronnie, how...

05:58.488 --> 05:59.837
Where did you get all of this?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.144
I put in a to-go order
at the country club.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.233
Daddy gave me the idea.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.670
I figured this could supplement
whatever you and yours are
cooking for the kids.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.411
[laughs]

06:08.455 --> 06:10.239
Red,

06:10.282 --> 06:13.111
tell me this doesn't mean
you're deep-frying
a Thanksgiving turkey?

06:13.155 --> 06:16.854
Yes. I am. It's tradition.
My dad would do one every year.

06:16.898 --> 06:19.596
Best damn turkey I ever tasted.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.424
You should come by tomorrow,
Mr. Jones.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.471
Actually, Archie,
that's what we need
to talk about.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.822
I hate to do this,
but I'm under orders...

06:28.475 --> 06:29.693
to shut you down.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.087
What? Orders from who?

06:33.262 --> 06:35.656
Let me guess, the Mayor?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.397
[scoffs] Well, you have got
to be kidding me.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.833
-He can't do this.
-Yeah, he can,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.704
he's mayor now.
He can do anything.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.099
And technically,
the attack on Dodger is
an open investigation.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.797
So this is still an active
crime scene, plus,

06:46.841 --> 06:48.364
Hiram said,
with the ice storm coming--

06:48.408 --> 06:50.148
He's doing this to punish me.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.759
To get me
to spend the holiday with him.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.761
-Can't we push back?
-I did.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.024
For a couple of hours.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.464
Look.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.031
I'm not supposed to say this,

07:03.074 --> 07:05.076
but I know what I would do,
if I was in your place.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.775
Screw him!

07:08.515 --> 07:10.125
Yeah.

07:10.168 --> 07:13.476
I'm sorry, but Hiram Lodge
is not canceling Thanksgiving.

07:13.998 --> 07:14.999
Good man.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
You're doin' your dad proud.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.934
Hey, stranger.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.109
Hey!

07:38.153 --> 07:39.633
Wow, that was fast.

07:39.676 --> 07:42.287
I took an earlier train
to beat the storm.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.941
[keyboard clicking]

07:43.985 --> 07:44.942
[bag thumps]

07:44.986 --> 07:46.030
Jug.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.292
Hit "save."

07:47.336 --> 07:48.946
I know. I'm sorry.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.600
I am almost done
with my first chapter.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.254
Yeah,
and I can't wait to read it,

07:52.297 --> 07:55.170
-and to help you sleuth.
-[Jughead exhales]

07:55.213 --> 07:57.477
But right now,
we have some catching up to do.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.913
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.485
[Alice] FP? What's wrong?

08:06.921 --> 08:08.662
Hiram.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.141
Can't believe
I'm working for him again,

08:10.185 --> 08:12.840
still doing
his damn dirty work.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.711
Well...

08:14.755 --> 08:17.322
-[FP exhales]
-You could do like we
talked about. You could quit.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.150
That's what he
expects me to do.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.587
But you know what
I am not gonna do?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.632
I am not gonna wear
that crap uniform

08:22.676 --> 08:25.200
to tell a bunch of teenagers,
that they can't feed
homeless kids. It's...

08:26.810 --> 08:30.205
Well, whatever you decide,
I back you 100%.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.817
I appreciate that, Alice.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.906
But, I do have one request.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.564
[FP] Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

08:42.870 --> 08:46.134
Not really in the mood to cook.

08:46.177 --> 08:49.050
So, can we have turkey dinner
at Pop's tomorrow night?

08:49.093 --> 08:51.052
-Fine by me.
-[Alice squeals]

08:52.619 --> 08:54.795
Since we have the house
to ourselves...

08:54.838 --> 08:55.970
[shoes landing]

09:01.628 --> 09:03.194
What happened to
dinner at the club?

09:03.238 --> 09:04.761
[door slams]

09:04.805 --> 09:06.328
Oh, well, the club was closed
because of the storm,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.112
so, we decided to order in.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.462
[Hermosa] Plus, I have to take
an earlier flight
back to Miami.

09:10.506 --> 09:11.899
[inhales sharply] But,

09:11.942 --> 09:15.729
I couldn't bear to miss
my first Thanksgiving

09:15.772 --> 09:18.253
all together, hermanita.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.604
Please, join us.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.737
[Veronica] Never.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.522
Only your blackened heart

09:26.566 --> 09:27.828
would take away Thanksgiving

09:27.871 --> 09:30.526
from a bunch
of underprivileged kids,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.223
just to get what you want.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.877
[sighs]

09:33.921 --> 09:35.400
Are you referring
to my decision to close
Archie's shelter?

09:35.444 --> 09:37.577
It was a matter
of public safety, mija.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.752
It's nothing personal.

09:47.630 --> 09:48.936
Neither was that...

09:49.632 --> 09:50.677
Papi.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.638
[Archie] You sure
you still wanna come, Mom?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.248
[Mary] Yeah, it's Thanksgiving.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.511
And I know the difference
between the letter of the law

09:59.555 --> 10:02.906
and doing what's right.
And feeding those kids
is what's right.

10:02.950 --> 10:06.823
[sighs] Anyway,
Hiram is not gonna have guards
stationed outside the door.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.738
Honestly, I'm more worried
about the storm.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.914
Well, I'll put chains
on the truck's tires

10:10.958 --> 10:13.047
and salt the sidewalk,
around the center.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.138
Mom?

10:18.443 --> 10:19.357
[softly] Hey, what's wrong?

10:21.142 --> 10:22.447
Your father.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.405
[sniffles]

10:23.448 --> 10:24.798
I just miss him.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.321
-It's not right.
-No.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.803
But, hey,

10:29.846 --> 10:32.153
we'll get through this.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.111
And we're doing
exactly what he'd be doing.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.683
[sniffles]

10:40.727 --> 10:42.293
[Toni] We're in trouble,
Cheryl.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.687
-Pray tell?
-I just ran into
your Aunt Cricket.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.255
She's parked down the road,
spying on us.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.126
That's the reason
why I've been feeling watched.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.738
Did you interact with
that nosy old turkey wattle?

10:51.781 --> 10:54.523
Babe, how are we gonna
get rid of your
Uncle Bedford's body

10:54.566 --> 10:56.046
now that she's staking us out?

10:57.352 --> 10:58.962
[clicks tongue]

10:59.006 --> 11:01.878
We need to scare
dear Cricket off,
once and for all,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.271
and disabuse her of the idea

11:03.314 --> 11:06.666
that she will ever get
even a sliver

11:06.709 --> 11:08.058
of our maple empire.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.802
By...

11:15.675 --> 11:17.372
inviting her

11:17.415 --> 11:19.722
to celebrate
a traditional
Blossom Thanksgiving with us,

11:19.766 --> 11:21.855
one honoring my Gothic,

11:21.898 --> 11:23.378
ghoulish roots.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.032
I am afraid to ask.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.122
Toni,

11:28.165 --> 11:30.167
there is a family legend
Nana Rose shared with me

11:30.211 --> 11:32.953
on one of her
more lucid days...

11:33.780 --> 11:35.172
that will be the centerpiece

11:35.216 --> 11:38.654
of a carefully-planned
performance art piece.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.090
A tale so gruesome,

11:40.134 --> 11:42.005
it will turn
Aunt Cricket's hair white

11:42.049 --> 11:43.790
and send her fleeing
into the night,

11:43.833 --> 11:45.705
never to be heard from again.

11:49.665 --> 11:50.971
I missed you.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.277
Hmm, I missed you too.

11:56.106 --> 11:59.719
I was thinking about
Mr. Chipping again earlier.

11:59.762 --> 12:03.723
How he died just after
he went to talk to DuPont,
about my grandpa.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.335
I think Mr. DuPont

12:07.378 --> 12:10.164
threatened or blackmailed him
into killing himself.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.863
Wow, that's an...

12:13.907 --> 12:15.735
extreme theory, Jug.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.693
What's the motive?

12:17.737 --> 12:21.915
Well, the Baxter Brothers
franchise is worth something
like $200 million.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.743
That's a compelling motive
for Mr. DuPont

12:23.786 --> 12:25.309
not to want his fraud exposed.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
Yeah, but what leverage
did DuPont have over Chipping

12:27.834 --> 12:29.400
to make him kill himself?

12:29.444 --> 12:32.273
This is where
it gets interesting.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.449
How do you get someone
to do something
they don't want to do?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.407
Blackmail, right?

12:38.845 --> 12:40.803
Look...

12:40.847 --> 12:42.674
at these yearbook photos
I printed out

12:42.718 --> 12:43.806
of Mr. DuPont and Chipping.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.765
These are decades apart.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.288
You notice anything?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.726
Is that the same tiepin?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
[Jughead] Yes.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.121
Apparently,

12:54.164 --> 12:56.993
that is the mark
of Quill and Skull.

12:57.037 --> 13:00.344
It's one of Stonewall's
oldest secret societies.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.477
And like
so many secret societies,

13:02.520 --> 13:04.435
what if their initiation
has something to do

13:04.479 --> 13:06.916
with you revealing your deepest
and darkest secrets?

13:06.960 --> 13:10.528
Well, then DuPont may have used
Chipping's blackmail material

13:10.572 --> 13:12.052
to coerce him into suicide.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.097
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

13:14.141 --> 13:17.144
Then, maybe
some of my current classmates
are part of the same society.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.710
I mean, I checked Bret's side
of the room,

13:18.754 --> 13:21.975
but so far, there is no sign
of a telltale tiepin.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.848
Is it getting colder in here?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.589
Yeah.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.069
The radiator is on.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.159
Just barely.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.552
[chuckles] This is the part
where we freeze
and starve to death?

13:34.596 --> 13:38.861
No, this is the part
where we get back in bed
and order Chinese food.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.125
[Betty chuckles]

13:44.519 --> 13:45.563
[doorbell chiming]

[Hermione gasps]

13:47.914 --> 13:49.437
[music playing]

13:49.480 --> 13:52.309
Of all the burger joints,
they have to walk into ours.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.441
[Pop] Mr. Lodge!

13:53.484 --> 13:54.964
Wasn't expecting
to see you here tonight.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.488
Well, truthfully,
our dinner plans fell through,

13:57.532 --> 13:59.012
so, we braved the storm.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.622
Take a seat. I'll be right out.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.015
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Pop.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.234
Oh, thank you.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.022
FP. Alice.

14:09.065 --> 14:14.375
♪ Should old acquaintance
be forgot... ♪

14:14.418 --> 14:15.289
Hermione,

14:15.724 --> 14:17.247
Hiram...

14:17.291 --> 14:18.553
Would you like to join us?

14:23.384 --> 14:24.472
We would love to.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.908
Yeah, okay.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.171
[groans]

14:28.215 --> 14:29.999
That's strike three.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.132
Nowhere is going to be
delivering, because
of this ice storm.

14:34.525 --> 14:35.613
How about...

14:36.832 --> 14:38.529
I just raid
the vending machine?

14:38.573 --> 14:39.922
Yes.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.098
I can finally live out
my Charlie Brown fantasy

14:42.142 --> 14:44.057
of having junk food
for Thanksgiving dinner.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.015
Yes! Okay, I will have

14:46.059 --> 14:48.235
Stonewall's finest
chocolate chip cookies,

14:48.278 --> 14:50.498
chips, soda
and candy, please.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.284
Get yourself something too.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.941

What do you want?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.532
[grunts]

15:25.359 --> 15:26.447
Betty...

15:26.490 --> 15:28.710
I saw him sneak
past the door.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.538
[sighs]

15:30.581 --> 15:32.409
[masked woman]
What the hell, you guys?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.673
What did you do to him?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.240
Donna, what did we do?

15:37.284 --> 15:39.112
What're you guys doing here?

15:39.155 --> 15:42.202
And why're you wearing...
bunny masks?

15:42.245 --> 15:43.986
And carrying an ax?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.640
We were just trying
to scare you, Jones,
have a little fun.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.642
All right, well,
now your friend is bleeding

15:47.685 --> 15:49.905
and I'm sure this place's
infirmary is locked up
really tight,

15:49.949 --> 15:53.126
so yeah, that's fun.
Let's get him up.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.605
[Munroe] Oh, there he is.
What's going on, Eddie?

15:54.649 --> 15:56.433
[Eddie] You want some cider,
some coco?

15:56.477 --> 15:58.653
[Veronica] Even if this storm's
keeping most people away,

15:58.696 --> 16:01.177
thank goodness
you're doing this, Archie.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.613
Where else
would they have gone?

16:02.657 --> 16:04.441
[Archie] I don't know.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.009
But I'm thinking,
maybe we should keep
the center open overnight.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.663
No one should be out
in this ice.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.231
You're too good
for this world, Archiekins.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.320
Hey...

16:14.190 --> 16:15.409
How are you holding up?

16:16.714 --> 16:18.064
I'm good, why?

16:18.629 --> 16:19.891
I just...

16:19.935 --> 16:21.371
wanna make sure you're okay.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.678
And I am, Ronnie.

16:24.896 --> 16:28.683
It hasn't totally hit me yet,
I don't think.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.164
Well,

16:31.207 --> 16:32.295
when it does...

16:33.862 --> 16:35.037
I'm here for you.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.561
Okay?

16:39.563 --> 16:41.478
[Munroe] Hi. Okay.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.309
Just make yourselves at home
and have some cider.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.012
Hey, guys, come on in.
Welcome to the center.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.404
And who are you?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.363
I'm Archie.
I run the center with Munroe,

16:56.406 --> 16:58.060
my friend.
We're glad to have you.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.497
But, you're just
a kid yourself.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.065
Hey, Archie, uh,
there's a spill over here.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.546
I don't know where
the bucket and mop is.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.026
Uh, I got it, Mom.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.505
Excuse me, guys, uh,

17:08.549 --> 17:10.159
help yourself to some
hot chocolate or cider.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.508
Dinner will be ready in a bit.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.739
[groaning]

17:24.782 --> 17:27.742
That should do it.
Three stitches, not too bad.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.224
[panting] Yeah.
It's easy for you to say.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.531
Well, maybe next time,

17:34.575 --> 17:36.403
don't threaten my boyfriend
with an ax.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.580
[breathing heavily]

17:49.155 --> 17:51.244
"It saddens me greatly
to realize

17:51.287 --> 17:53.637
that these will be
the last words I ever write."

17:55.161 --> 17:56.118
Hands off, Forsythe.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.424
What was that?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.904
Was that a suicide note?
Mr. Chipping's?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.384
It was an exercise we did.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.864
We each wrote
a note to see

18:02.907 --> 18:05.388
who could best capture
the inner workings

18:05.432 --> 18:07.129
of Chipping's troubled mind.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.304
If it was
an official exercise,

18:08.348 --> 18:09.784
then why wasn't I included?

18:10.872 --> 18:13.527
It was outside
the curriculum, relax.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.790
Come on, Bret,
let's get you cleaned up.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.581
Jug, what are they
doing here, really?

18:24.625 --> 18:26.192
I don't know.
But I certainly don't believe

18:26.235 --> 18:28.585
any of that BS
about a writing exercise.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.240
Well, maybe it's incriminating
evidence that

18:31.284 --> 18:32.720
they wanna get rid of,

18:32.763 --> 18:34.417
or fake evidence
that they're trying to plant.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.246
[sighing] Okay. How are we
gonna play this game?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.074
You said it.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.555
Your chums like playing games.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.515
Let's give them
a taste of their own medicine.

18:48.953 --> 18:52.305
Aunt Cricket, we're so thrilled
you were able to join us...

18:52.348 --> 18:53.958
and that you brought
Cousin Fester.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.438
Well, I wanted witnesses,

18:55.482 --> 18:58.224
so I don't go missing
the way Bedford did.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.008
Don't be silly.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.705
Dinner will be ready soon.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.317
Can I offer you some
mulled berry wine to start?

19:15.632 --> 19:17.286
Hey, Archie.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.158
What's up, Eddie?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.855
You see those people
over there?

19:21.943 --> 19:24.511
I've seen them before
at the arcade.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.775
They're Dodger's family.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.519
What the hell? You sure?

19:34.956 --> 19:36.784
[sighs] All right.
Thanks for the heads-up.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.829
Go grab a seat.
I'll take care of it.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.266
And hey, be cool.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.712
I'm not sure
what you're here for,

19:51.755 --> 19:53.540
but you and your boys
need to leave.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.542
We've got kids here.
We don't want any trouble.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.762
We don't want
any trouble either.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.332
But we've come for the man

20:03.376 --> 20:05.204
who tried to kill
our Dodger.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.511
Got a feeling he's you,

20:09.425 --> 20:11.079
or one of your friends.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.385
I swear to you,

20:12.428 --> 20:14.735
no one here tried
to hurt Dodger.

20:14.778 --> 20:15.649
Well, someone did.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.825
And whoever it is,

20:17.868 --> 20:20.349
he's got a real soft spot
for this place.

20:20.393 --> 20:23.222
We think, if we hang out here
long enough,

20:24.179 --> 20:25.398
he'll show.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.443
[Darla] In the meantime,

20:27.487 --> 20:31.534
how about some of that
delicious food I'm smelling?

20:31.578 --> 20:32.709
[sniffs]

20:32.753 --> 20:34.189
You guys remember,
back in high school,

20:34.233 --> 20:35.799
when we all used to
hang out together?

20:35.843 --> 20:38.280
Us griping about
how horrible
our parents were.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.021
And now we're
the horrible parents.

20:41.892 --> 20:45.374
Fred never complained
about his folks, not once.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.724
Look what an amazing father
he turned out to be.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.772
Think we could all take
a lesson from that, huh?

20:54.122 --> 20:57.647
Hey, what say we continue this
downstairs, over drinks?

20:57.691 --> 21:00.476
-Huh? To toast Fred!
-Yes.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.565
What do you say, FP, huh?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.437
You're not on duty, are you?

21:06.743 --> 21:08.615
Why the hell not, Mr. Mayor?

21:11.052 --> 21:15.448
Well, considering we're trapped
here until the morning,
at least,

21:15.491 --> 21:18.451
what say we pass the time
with a game of
"Never Have I Ever"?

21:18.494 --> 21:21.454
I do love a good salacious
drinking game.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.586
I'll start.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.372
Never have I ever...

21:26.981 --> 21:28.330
kissed a girl.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.290
Betty.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.644
Never have I ever...

21:38.384 --> 21:39.602
done drugs.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.738
Jones, I'm surprised.
Isn't Riverdale, like,

21:44.781 --> 21:46.653
the drug capital of the world?

21:49.003 --> 21:50.613
Never have I ever...

21:51.397 --> 21:52.572
been in a gang.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.445
Really?

21:57.185 --> 21:59.013
But you look so sweet.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.494
[clicks tongue]
Oh. Well, I'm not as sweet
as you might think.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.980
Never have I ever been
in a secret society.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.379
Oops. Looks like you lose
that round, Forsythe.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.902
Now you gotta finish
the whole flask.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.781
Time for a refill.
I'll go get the bottle
from your room, Jug.

23:12.913 --> 23:15.524
Jug, I found this tiepin
in Donna's room,

23:15.568 --> 23:17.396
and it has an engraving
on the back.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.529
The initials "RC."

23:20.573 --> 23:22.226
What was Mr. Chipping's
first name?

23:22.270 --> 23:23.445
Rooper!

23:23.489 --> 23:24.707
-These are his initials.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.796
How does Donna have this?

23:26.840 --> 23:29.451
Killers often take something
from their victim

23:29.495 --> 23:31.584
as a souvenir or trophy.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.940
How long can this go on for?

23:41.071 --> 23:42.682
We have to fight back.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.685
No offense
to your "guns," Munroe,
but they have real ones.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.165
If I can get into the office,
in my desk,

23:48.209 --> 23:50.820
I have a drawer full of weapons
that I confiscated
off of the kids.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.344
-Knives, switchblades--
-No. Hold on.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.216
I'm not sure
I endorse this plan.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.958
Adding more weapons
to the stew? One of those
kids could get hurt.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.666
-[Munroe] Matthew!
-Hey, you little runt.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.668
-You want this?
-[Archie] Relax. Relax.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.278
-Don't do... Don't do anything!
-[Munroe] He didn't know
what he was doing.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.628
Look, he's just a kid.
Everyone, stay back.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.282
Archie!

24:18.326 --> 24:19.458
That's for my brother.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.071
You know what I think,
carrot top?

24:25.159 --> 24:27.553
I think you've got
a hero complex.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.470
You know what else I think?

24:31.513 --> 24:34.603
I think you beat
my boy Dodger into a coma,

24:34.647 --> 24:38.520
and then, you called
an ambulance so no one
would suspect you.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.653
But a mother, she knows.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.959
And you...

24:43.003 --> 24:45.614
You are gonna pay
for what you've done!

24:46.615 --> 24:48.574
Now, get your ass down.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.761
Say it.

25:02.631 --> 25:03.893
Say it's you.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.808
You're the one
who almost killed my son.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.332
Ms. Dickinson, please.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.552
Whatever it is that you
think you have to do here,
you don't.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.901
Say it!

25:13.381 --> 25:14.861
Confess, boy,

25:14.904 --> 25:17.690
before things start
getting real ugly in here.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.001
If I say it,

25:25.045 --> 25:26.916
you'll let everyone
else here go...

25:26.960 --> 25:28.570
and you can do whatever
you want to me.

25:28.614 --> 25:29.832
I'll take that deal.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.879
But I need to hear you say it.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.056
Fine.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.539
Stop, stop. It's me.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.845
I wear the mask.
I'm the Dark Duke.
Leave Archie alone.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.847
Shut the hell up.
It's not him.

25:44.891 --> 25:48.372
-It's me. The mask is mine.
-Toby, sit down and shut up.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.678
I'm the guy you want.

25:49.722 --> 25:50.984
That's enough!

25:52.072 --> 25:54.988
Now, that was
a touching display.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.685
Hell...

25:56.729 --> 25:58.948
another day,
I might have even cried.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.776
But not today.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.692
I already spilled
all my tears over my son.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.389
And boy...

26:05.433 --> 26:09.568
your mother is gonna find out
exactly what that feels like.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.355
Go, get in the office.

26:14.398 --> 26:15.965
Go, go, go, go!

26:25.714 --> 26:27.586
Don't even try it.

26:28.456 --> 26:31.285
Stop! Step away from my son.

26:31.328 --> 26:34.418
I have the right to protect
myself against intruders,

26:34.462 --> 26:35.637
with deadly force.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.378
So, unless you want me
to use it,

26:37.421 --> 26:39.336
you have exactly five seconds

26:39.380 --> 26:40.816
to get the hell out of here.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.775
One.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.429
Two.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.387
Three.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.608
Four.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.354
Lock the door behind them
and let's call the police.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.791
Mrs. Andrews...

26:59.879 --> 27:02.098
I'm obsessed.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.100
-Yeah. Mom, since when
are you Dirty Harry?
-[loud bang]

27:05.711 --> 27:07.147
What was that explosion?

27:18.245 --> 27:22.162
Who in their right mind tries
to deep-fry a turkey inside?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.693
[Hiram] You're nursing it, FP.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.434
What's the matter,
you don't like my rum?

27:33.477 --> 27:35.479
[scoffs]

27:35.523 --> 27:38.395
Well, someone's got to be
clear-headed enough to drive
the rest of you home.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.180
[all chuckle]

27:42.138 --> 27:44.010
FP...

27:44.053 --> 27:45.838
you know, I sense
that you were upset with me

27:45.881 --> 27:49.232
when I asked you
to shut down Archie's
community center earlier.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.934
Anyway, I appreciate
your cooperation.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.111
I'm gonna make this clear,
Hiram.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.460
FP.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.418
I'm not your puppet.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.986
When I took this job,
I pledged to serve and protect
Riverdale,

28:04.030 --> 28:05.379
not to do your bidding.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.996
Why don't you settle down?

28:14.040 --> 28:15.519
Mmm-hmm.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.173
What's the matter?

28:17.217 --> 28:19.480
You put a hit out on my son,
you bastard.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.090
You think I forgot about that?

28:21.134 --> 28:23.876
Yeah. Is that why you
tried to murder me,

28:23.919 --> 28:26.661
at the behest of my own wife?

28:26.705 --> 28:27.749
Hiram.

28:27.793 --> 28:28.881
[both grunting]

28:33.407 --> 28:34.408
FP.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.890
Finish it.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.066
Do it.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.982
-Or get the hell off me.
-FP.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.593
-[Hiram] Come on.
-[panting] I'm not gonna do it.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.377
But you deserve it.

28:47.421 --> 28:50.729
Everyone in this room...
Hell, everyone in this town

28:50.772 --> 28:52.339
knows that you deserve it!

28:56.865 --> 28:58.040
[bottle breaks]

29:00.521 --> 29:04.394
Whilst we all tuck into
our delicious homemade
meat pies,

29:04.438 --> 29:07.093
might I suggest we reminisce
about some Thanksgivings
of yore?

29:08.616 --> 29:09.748
Nana?

29:09.791 --> 29:11.532
Will you regale us?

29:11.575 --> 29:12.489
Well...

29:14.230 --> 29:18.713
There is the story of the first
Blossom Thanksgiving, but...

29:18.757 --> 29:21.455
it's a dark chapter.

29:21.498 --> 29:22.804
Deeply dark.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.110
That's fine.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.286
I'd love to hear more
about your family,

29:26.329 --> 29:27.853
warts and all.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.246
The weather had turned...

29:30.290 --> 29:34.163
and the Blossom settlers were
surprised by...

29:34.816 --> 29:37.427
a sudden, brutal

29:37.471 --> 29:39.473
onset of ice.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.606
Much like tonight.

29:42.650 --> 29:46.436
The wagons were
snowed in,
and soon after,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.961
the hunger set in.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.486
Deep.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.315
Aching.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.144
Gnawing.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.756
Stomachs, groaning so loud,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.759
they drowned
out the wind, until...

30:04.803 --> 30:06.021
Until what, Nana?

30:08.241 --> 30:10.591
The Blossoms turned
on one another.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.116
They had to eat their own.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.466
Survive...

30:17.554 --> 30:19.992
on Blossom flesh.

30:22.908 --> 30:26.825
Do you mean... cannibalism?

30:26.868 --> 30:31.568
I can only imagine what
a scandal like that would
do to our family name.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.832
Especially, if it were
to come out right
as Aunt Cricket were

30:33.875 --> 30:37.270
attempting to negotiate a sale
for our maple business.

30:37.313 --> 30:40.664
Please, no one would
believe that snuff.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.318
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

30:42.362 --> 30:45.365
We Blossoms have always
been highly carnivorous.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.107
I mean...

30:48.150 --> 30:51.023
I ate my brother Julian
in the womb.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.548
And you're eating
those meat pies we prepared
especially for you.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.856
[grunts] My tooth.

31:00.554 --> 31:02.121
What on earth?

31:04.645 --> 31:06.168
What?

31:06.212 --> 31:09.084
Is this Uncle Bedford's ring?

31:09.998 --> 31:11.043
What does this mean?

31:11.086 --> 31:13.480
It means, Aunt Cricket...

31:13.523 --> 31:16.178
that you're welcome
to search the house.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.267
It means that Uncle Bedford...

31:18.964 --> 31:20.400
will never be found.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.229
It means that any evidence
he was ever here...

31:24.970 --> 31:26.319
is in the process of being...

31:27.363 --> 31:28.625
digested.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.151
In other words,

31:32.194 --> 31:34.022
I think you know what it means.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.243
You... You're bluffing.

31:37.286 --> 31:42.204
Not even you are deranged
enough to commit such
an unspeakable abomination.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.032
On the contrary.

31:44.076 --> 31:46.905
[gasps] Which reminds me...

31:46.948 --> 31:49.342
it's time for dessert.
T.T.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.040
[Cousin Fester shrieks]

31:52.084 --> 31:53.999
Face facts, Aunt Cricket.

31:54.042 --> 31:57.219
You and Cousin Fester
have just committed a vile act
of cannibalism,

31:57.263 --> 31:59.613
which is illegal in this state.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.528
So, unless you want the world
to learn as much,

32:01.571 --> 32:03.922
you will leave us
the hell alone.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.837
You do not knock on my door,
you do not harass
my girlfriend.

32:06.881 --> 32:11.146
You do not ask me to sell off
my Blossom legacy ever again.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.495
Are we clear?

32:13.409 --> 32:15.324
Now,

32:15.368 --> 32:16.935
would you like me to pack up
the rest of Bedford for you
in Tupperware?

32:16.978 --> 32:18.284
[groaning]

32:19.938 --> 32:21.243
Fester...

32:26.074 --> 32:27.293
[glass clinks]

32:31.645 --> 32:34.256
There you two are.
We thought you'd been murdered.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.650
No dice on the booze,
I see.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.521
Not a drop to be found.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.480
But I say we keep playing
the game...

32:40.523 --> 32:42.003
and I'll go next.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.311
Never have I ever tried
to cover up a murder.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.359
Oh, you guys are just so cool.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.971
You know that?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.276
You never break into sweat,

32:54.320 --> 32:56.539
never betraying an emotion.

32:56.583 --> 33:00.021
Hell, writing fake
suicide notes,
how cool is that?

33:02.197 --> 33:04.286
Well, you guys
aren't as devious
as you think.

33:04.330 --> 33:07.376
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
left incriminating evidence,

33:07.420 --> 33:10.901
like Mr. Chipping's tiepin.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.642
You went into my room?

33:12.686 --> 33:15.254
It was an accident.
I mean, all the doors
look the same.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.256
Between the suicide note
and the tiepin,

33:17.299 --> 33:20.563
you two are trying to cover up
something about
Mr. Chipping's suicide.

33:20.607 --> 33:21.477
Or was it a murder?

33:22.043 --> 33:23.175
Care to explain?

33:24.350 --> 33:25.699
You were there, Jones.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.918
You saw him jump.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.659
No one pushed him
out that window.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.574
Not physically.

33:31.618 --> 33:35.013
But psychologically,
Mr. Chipping could have been
pushed to the edge.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.326
Donna.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.807
How... Where...

33:46.850 --> 33:49.244
did you get this?
We just wanna know the truth.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.072
Mr. Chipping
gave it to me, okay?

33:51.116 --> 33:52.508
We were having an affair.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.337
[sighs]

33:58.732 --> 34:01.082
[sighs softly] I knew
it was wrong.

34:01.126 --> 34:04.303
And I...
I didn't want anybody
to get into trouble.

34:04.346 --> 34:07.393
So, I tried to
break it off with him.

34:07.436 --> 34:10.526
[breath hitches]
But then he got... aggressive.

34:10.570 --> 34:14.095
[sobs] I was so scared.
I told him,
if he didn't stop,

34:14.139 --> 34:16.880
I would go to the headmaster.
And then...

34:16.924 --> 34:20.188
[sobbing] And the next day,
he jumped out of a window.

34:22.886 --> 34:26.934
I can't live my life
doing Hiram's bidding,
Alice.

34:26.977 --> 34:30.807
I'm not cut out for it.
There's too much blood
on the tracks.

34:30.851 --> 34:34.507
-I hear you.
-I am a Serpent, Alice.
I am a Serpent!

34:36.117 --> 34:38.772
Every bone in my body
is a Serpent.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.864
Okay, so is there a rule
that says that
you can't be both?

34:50.784 --> 34:52.177
That's not bad.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.658
If Hiram can be mayor
and a kingpin,

34:55.702 --> 34:59.619
who says,
that I can't be sheriff
and a gang leader?

35:03.797 --> 35:04.798
[laughs]

35:09.324 --> 35:11.152
How're you feeling, my love?

35:13.546 --> 35:16.810
I think, relieved? [sighs]

35:16.853 --> 35:20.205
Am I crazy,
or did we just manage
to pull our plan off?

35:20.248 --> 35:22.598
The latter.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.297
By morning,
Sweetwater River will have
frozen over,

35:25.340 --> 35:27.473
and Aunt Cricket
and Cousin Fester will be back

35:27.516 --> 35:30.519
in whatever ring of hell
they typically inhabit,

35:30.563 --> 35:34.784
digesting those
yummy lamb meat pies.

35:34.828 --> 35:38.310
And Uncle Bedford's name will
never be spoken aloud again.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.313
I do feel some kind of peace,

35:42.009 --> 35:44.316
in some weird way.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.709
We defended our home
from hostile invaders.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.452
And, for the rest
of the weekend,

35:50.496 --> 35:52.846
we have nothing to worry about
but ourselves.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.982
And...

35:59.026 --> 36:01.159
Something I haven't yet said.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.122
I love you.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.820
And I'm so grateful to you.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.561
Yeah, love you too, babe.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.435
And, happy Thanksgiving.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.882
I'm just so confused.

36:28.925 --> 36:32.407
This whole time,
Mr. Chipping was the bad guy?
It wasn't Bret,

36:32.451 --> 36:33.843
or Mr. DuPont?

36:34.844 --> 36:37.499
And poor Donna.

36:37.543 --> 36:41.242
I'm not so sure
that Donna
isn't playing us, Jug.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.852
What do you mean?

36:42.896 --> 36:44.724
Are you saying
she made all of that up?

36:44.767 --> 36:46.682
Well, I don't wanna say that,
because there's a possibility

36:46.726 --> 36:48.554
that they had
a harrowing affair.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.558
But there's a possibility...

36:52.601 --> 36:55.213
in which the story
that she told me

36:55.256 --> 36:58.868
was just to stall us
from uncovering the real truth.

37:01.523 --> 37:05.092
You should just talk
to your headmaster, Jug.

37:05.135 --> 37:08.530
I mean, get it on his radar
that something weird
is happening at this school.

37:08.574 --> 37:11.141
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

37:11.185 --> 37:14.101
I will.

37:14.144 --> 37:17.278
Hey, I was thinking, maybe,
if the storm clears up
by tomorrow morning,

37:17.322 --> 37:18.714
that we can go home
for the weekend.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.151
Sure, but in the meantime,
how...

37:21.195 --> 37:23.241
How will we stay warm tonight?

37:26.896 --> 37:27.984
[Betty chuckles]

37:29.247 --> 37:30.683
[laughs]

37:34.164 --> 37:36.384
Before we start...

37:36.428 --> 37:39.431
We were never
a particularly religious house.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.564
But the one thing
we always did,

37:42.608 --> 37:45.611
the one thing
my husband always liked to do,

37:45.654 --> 37:48.483
when we sat down together
to eat as a family,

37:49.092 --> 37:50.616
was to say grace.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.314
He believed in that.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.796
Archie, would you do
the honors?

37:57.362 --> 37:58.798
Yeah.

38:02.149 --> 38:07.023
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, the gifts
which we're about to receive.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.287
For this day, for this food,

38:09.330 --> 38:13.465
for our family,
for our friends,
we thank you, Amen.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.075
[all] Amen.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.468
And then he would say...

38:17.512 --> 38:19.079
Dig in, everyone.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.473
We're grateful to be alive,
and to be here with you.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.702
What's this about, Sheriff?

38:33.746 --> 38:35.922
Dodger Dickenson's family
is at large and dangerous,

38:35.965 --> 38:38.925
and we have reason to believe
they might try to get to him,
before they skip town.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.536
Well, we monitor our patients
fairly closely.

38:44.844 --> 38:47.020
Well, not closely enough,
huh, Doc?

38:48.195 --> 38:49.327
[sighs]

38:51.416 --> 38:53.026
Ah, excuse me, Headmaster?

39:05.430 --> 39:07.823
[Jughead]
What's that all about?

39:07.867 --> 39:09.521
Donna came clean
to the Headmaster

39:09.564 --> 39:11.697
about her affair with Chipping.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.439
How he basically
abused and harassed her.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.659
She was trying to
protect this family,

39:17.703 --> 39:20.401
prevent any further pain,
but after...

39:20.445 --> 39:22.011
Betty broke into her room,

39:22.055 --> 39:23.926
Donna felt like
she had no choice

39:23.970 --> 39:26.494
but to talk
to the authorities about...

39:26.538 --> 39:28.540
all the awful things
Chipping did to her.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.675
Now I guess
there's no doubt about it
anymore.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.896
Chipping's death was a suicide,

39:36.939 --> 39:39.377
driven by a guilty man's
fear of exposure.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.121
Case closed, Detective Jones.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.367
[sighs]

40:13.411 --> 40:15.717
[strumming guitar]

40:24.987 --> 40:26.032
Archie...

40:28.295 --> 40:31.472
yesterday was without a doubt

40:31.516 --> 40:34.432
the strangest Thanksgiving
I've ever had.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.609
-I mean, I pointed a gun
at a woman.
-[chuckles]

40:37.652 --> 40:40.960
-Welcome to Riverdale, Mom.
-[chuckles]

40:41.003 --> 40:43.092
But yeah, it's a far cry
from me, you and Dad

40:43.136 --> 40:46.400
just eating fried turkey
and watching football.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.489
He never made it
past the third quarter.
[chuckles]

40:48.533 --> 40:50.230
He fell asleep on the couch.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.841
[sighs]

40:52.885 --> 40:54.974
You know,
I've been thinking about...

40:55.017 --> 40:58.107
that deep fryer exploding
when it did.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.762
I mean,
what are the odds of that?

41:00.806 --> 41:02.416
That saved us, Archie.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.722
Yeah, we got lucky, Mom.

41:03.765 --> 41:06.507
No. That wasn't luck.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.770
That was your dad
watching out for us.

41:10.772 --> 41:11.991
I think you're right.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.515
And that gives me an idea.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.910
[crowd clapping and cheering]

41:25.308 --> 41:27.267
[clapping continues]

41:29.661 --> 41:31.227
What you think, Mom?

41:31.271 --> 41:33.969
Your father never would
have believed this.

41:34.013 --> 41:37.495
Everything you've been
building here...
[sighs softly]

41:37.538 --> 41:38.974
All of you...

41:40.062 --> 41:41.499
He'd be honored

41:42.500 --> 41:43.675
and so proud.
