if she were to become a mother.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.293
to a rented house
in rural Oregon

03:30.376 --> 03:32.962
because she didn't want to raise
a kid in the city.

We'd probably have a house
with a couple of acres,

03:36.299 --> 03:40.970
with food and animals.
We'd probably be online,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.556
but we'd also have access
to go off the grid

03:43.640 --> 03:46.601
because infant skulls
have not fully formed,

03:46.684 --> 03:49.854

wireless radiation

NATHAN: But her fears made sense
to me.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.783
It's scary to imagine raising
a child when you always know

04:01.866 --> 04:04.118
that a single misstep
on your part

04:04.202 --> 04:06.120
could ruin their entire life.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.542
Angela's rehearsal began
with a simulated adoption

04:11.626 --> 04:13.002
just like she envisioned.

Maybe you can elaborate a bit

three years, and for each age

05:15.064 --> 05:17.150
multiple child actors
will be needed

05:17.233 --> 05:19.902
in order to comply
with Oregon state labor laws

05:19.986 --> 05:23.698
that limit the number of hours
a child can work.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.742
With babies capped at four hours

05:25.825 --> 05:28.369
it requires multiple switches
each day,

05:28.453 --> 05:30.872
which I tried to make
as seamless as possible

05:32.540 --> 05:34.876

But just as important
as her experience

05:38.254 --> 05:40.131
was the well-being
of the babies.

of the feet?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.266
Mm-hmm, the oil.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.102
NATHAN: I had to keep track
of everything she wanted to do

05:53.186 --> 05:56.481
with these kids and get
the real parents' consent.

05:56.564 --> 06:00.777
Lavender oil on soles of feet
to calm them.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.822
Sure, she can give it a shot
if she wants.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.492

Lavender oil okay.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.328
But the most important element
of Angela's future life

06:10.411 --> 06:15.166
as a mother was still missing,
a man by her side.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.251
Prior to the start
of her rehearsal,

06:17.335 --> 06:18.753
I'd encouraged her to meet up

06:18.836 --> 06:20.463
with some of her
dating app matches

06:20.546 --> 06:21.881
to see if she could find someone

06:21.964 --> 06:23.758

she was looking for

06:23.841 --> 06:25.009

don't really read the Bible

06:36.938 --> 06:38.314

what it says.

can be problematic

going by their opinions and...
