01:05.467 --> 01:07.767
Hello, Frank's flowers?

01:07.834 --> 01:10.433
Hey, Frank.
Sophia Petrillo here.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.834
I decided the price you quoted me
on those centerpieces is too high.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.734
Maybe we could make a deal.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.600
Now, my daughter is single.

01:20.667 --> 01:23.667
What do you mean, is she easy?

01:23.734 --> 01:26.600
You're talking about
my flesh and blood.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.800
40% off?
Oh, you bet she's easy.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.367
Sure. Dorothy will love that.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.166
Ok, Frank. I'll set it up.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.834
-Got to go.
-Who was that?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.767
A florist.

01:42.834 --> 01:46.433
Guess who got a terrific deal
on flowers for the awards banquet?

01:46.500 --> 01:50.967
Really? Ever since
we started planning this banquet,

01:51.033 --> 01:53.133
you have been incredible.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.567
You got a great deal
on the flowers,

01:55.633 --> 01:58.867
the caterer, the janitorial service.

01:58.934 --> 02:01.734
I wish I worked
this hard for charity.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.867
You will, pussycat. You will.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.467
I got a letter
from my brother Clayton.

02:09.533 --> 02:12.533
He's coming to visit next week.
He has a surprise.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.033
That's wonderful.

02:14.100 --> 02:18.400
I bet Clayton's met a girl.
He wants me to meet her.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.600
Honey, your brother is gay.

02:22.066 --> 02:27.066
That gay thing was just a phase
he was going through,

02:27.133 --> 02:28.667
like when Clay was in high school,

02:28.734 --> 02:31.233
all he wanted to do
was see gladiator movies.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.834
It's the same kind of thing.

02:34.867 --> 02:37.166
Almost exactly.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.567
Rose, honey, congratulations.

02:40.633 --> 02:44.033
You've been nominated again
for the volunteer of the year award.

02:44.100 --> 02:48.166
Seven years I've been nominated
for the volunteer vanguard award.

02:48.233 --> 02:52.433
Seven years I've watched Agnes
Bradshaw snatch it away from me.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.633
She won't do that this year.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.633
This year I'll finally beat her.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.967
Because you worked
harder than Agnes?

03:00.033 --> 03:01.266
Because she's dead.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.166
Yup... as a doornail.

03:07.233 --> 03:10.600
Dead, dead, dead. Coffee?

03:13.100 --> 03:17.200
Rose, how can you be so cheery?
It's a terrible thing.

03:17.266 --> 03:20.467
She was 89,
and she died in her sleep.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.633
She fell asleep
driving the bookmobile.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.266
It was a tragedy.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.166
She was my only real competition.

03:30.233 --> 03:32.400
Dead, dead, dead.

03:33.567 --> 03:34.533
Muffin?

03:36.066 --> 03:38.300
(mellow music playing)

03:38.367 --> 03:39.967
(doorbell chimes)

03:40.033 --> 03:41.767
I'll get it.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.000
-Clayton!
-Blanche!

03:47.066 --> 03:49.967
Oh, you're still the handsomest
man I know.

03:50.033 --> 03:53.033
And you're still the prettiest thing
I ever saw.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.967
Now I know why they call it
the deep south.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.533
You remember everybody.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.967
Ladies,
it's so good to see you again.

04:04.033 --> 04:06.867
All right, now, baby brother,
I've waited all week.

04:06.934 --> 04:09.300
Where's my surprise?

04:09.367 --> 04:10.567
Hello, everyone.

04:15.266 --> 04:17.300
Surprise.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.533
Put the luggage over there.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.100
I don't have any change
to tip the driver.

04:25.166 --> 04:25.867
Blanche--

04:25.934 --> 04:29.200
Why did you take a cab
from the airport?

04:29.266 --> 04:31.133
I would have picked you up.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.000
Blanche, this is Doug.

04:33.066 --> 04:36.266
He's my friend,
my very special friend.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.900
Any friend of Clay's...

04:41.166 --> 04:42.600
ah, so.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.300
Isn't it wonderful
they became so close

04:46.367 --> 04:48.300
between the airport and here?

04:52.367 --> 04:56.300
I hardly ever speak
to my cab drivers.

04:56.367 --> 05:00.300
-Rose, Doug is not a cab driver.
-Actually, I'm a policeman.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.033
Oh. Well,
what's a policeman doing

05:03.100 --> 05:04.767
bringing fares from the airport?

05:06.333 --> 05:09.500
I know.
I bet you do undercover work.

05:14.633 --> 05:17.166
And I'll bet he does it damn well.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.000
You'll have
to excuse my mother.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.600
She survived a slight stroke,

05:26.667 --> 05:30.333
which left her, if I can be frank,
a complete burden.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.233
Why don't we all get
something to drink?

05:36.300 --> 05:39.233
Have you known Blanche a long time?

05:39.300 --> 05:41.066
Oh, yes. You're in luck.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.133
She just loves policemen.

05:44.967 --> 05:47.033
Apparently, it's a hereditary trait.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.100
(serene music playing)

05:56.433 --> 05:59.700
I'll say this for Clayton,
he has great taste.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.567
Doug is absolutely charming.

06:01.633 --> 06:06.166
And funny. Not every cop can do
a good Bette Davis impression.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.500
I did a great job
hiding how upset I am.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.300
Like how you started sobbing

06:14.367 --> 06:17.166
when Clayton asked
for more fruit cocktail?

06:22.667 --> 06:25.100
I don't really mind
Clayton being homosexual.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.367
I just don't like him dating men.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.400
You really haven't grasped
the concept

06:32.467 --> 06:34.600
of this gay thing yet, have you?

06:34.667 --> 06:37.200
There must be homosexuals
who date women.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.133
Yeah. They're called lesbians.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.400
Hot damn!

06:46.467 --> 06:49.066
It's happened!
It's finally happened!

06:49.133 --> 06:52.333
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

06:52.400 --> 06:55.066
I take it we now get
the Disney channel.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.367
Even better.

06:58.433 --> 07:01.967
You're looking at the winner of this
year's volunteer vanguard award.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.600
Honey, what are you talking about?

07:04.667 --> 07:07.166
That award won't be
given out until Saturday.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.867
I called to confirm
our reservations.

07:09.934 --> 07:12.066
I don't have to pay for my ticket.

07:12.133 --> 07:14.467
The awards committee paid for me.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.467
So?

07:15.533 --> 07:17.567
The awards committee
wants to make sure

07:17.633 --> 07:19.834
I'll be there to accept the award.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.834
It's the only logical explanation.

07:22.900 --> 07:27.033
I think you're putting
the cart before the horse.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.433
And that's bad?

07:30.266 --> 07:33.433
Look, Rose, I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.367
Blanche, Doug and I were wondering

07:35.433 --> 07:38.433
what's happening
with the sleeping arrangements?

07:38.500 --> 07:42.367
Well, I'll be there in just a moment
to get you two settled in.

07:42.433 --> 07:46.834
If you sleepyheads could wait
just a... sleeping arrangements?

07:49.166 --> 07:51.734
What in hell am I gonna do
about the sleeping arrangements?

07:51.800 --> 07:56.400
You sleep on the couch and give
Clayton and Doug your room.

07:56.467 --> 08:00.100
What will the neighbors think
if they see two men in my bedroom?

08:03.233 --> 08:04.900
They'll think it's Tuesday.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.934
They can sleep in ma's room
and she'll sleep with me.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.400
Ma doesn't get a say.
It doesn't matter what ma thinks.

08:15.467 --> 08:18.400
Ma's a piece of furniture
who has no feelings or opinions.

08:18.467 --> 08:21.500
Nonsense, my little hat rack.

08:24.934 --> 08:29.166
Blanche, I don't understand. You
can't say you've accepted Clayton.

08:29.233 --> 08:32.767
-Unless you accept that he dates.
-Rose is right.

08:32.834 --> 08:35.100
Besides, in this day and age,

08:35.166 --> 08:38.700
you should be thrilled he's
in a monogamous relationship.

08:38.767 --> 08:40.200
Of course, you're right.

08:40.266 --> 08:43.033
I've got to stop overreacting.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.133
Doug and Clayton
are consenting adults.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.467
There's no reason for me
to be embarrassed.

08:47.533 --> 08:50.400
It's such a beautiful night Doug
and I are going for a walk.

08:50.467 --> 08:51.700
-Okay.
-Don't wait up.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.567
Enjoy your walk.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.600
I'm fine. I'm okay.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.367
I can deal with this.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.200
Look, they're skipping.

09:01.266 --> 09:02.667
Oh, God!

09:02.734 --> 09:06.734
Joke, joke. Just a joke.
It's a joke.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.000
I just had the strangest
crank call.

09:14.066 --> 09:16.734
Some man wanted to know
if I owned a riding crop

09:16.800 --> 09:18.333
and a leather bra.

09:19.633 --> 09:22.433
And if I could lick my eyebrows.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.834
What did you say?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.000
No.

09:28.066 --> 09:30.867
I guess we're paying full price
for the cocktail franks.

09:36.033 --> 09:36.800
Good news.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.367
Clayton and Doug said they'd love
to go to the banquet with us.

09:39.433 --> 09:40.433
What?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.667
Are you out of your mind?

09:42.734 --> 09:44.767
Why did you invite them?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.166
I want everybody there
for my triumph.

09:47.233 --> 09:48.533
It will be fun.

09:48.600 --> 09:53.200
Fun? Don't you understand?
They will be there together.

09:53.266 --> 09:55.266
But Blanche, they're here together.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.166
That's different.
This is going out in public.

09:58.233 --> 10:00.066
What will people say?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.700
Nothing we haven't heard before.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.333
Clay, I was just telling the girls--

10:05.400 --> 10:08.800
We heard what you were saying.
I'm sorry you feel that way.

10:08.867 --> 10:13.333
Why put yourselves through this?
You know how people can be.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.133
If you can't accept us,
how can anyone else, right?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.233
Right. No!

10:20.300 --> 10:21.700
No. What I mean--

10:21.767 --> 10:23.033
We get what you mean.

10:23.100 --> 10:28.266
What the world
thinks doesn't matter.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.567
I'd do anything for Doug,
and he'd bend over backwards for me.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.867
Sometimes I just love
to hug my mommy.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.767
It's time you told her, Clayton.

10:53.834 --> 10:54.834
What?

10:54.900 --> 10:58.066
I wanted you to meet Doug
for an important reason.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.467
Well, why?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.800
Blanche, we're getting married.

11:06.400 --> 11:11.100
That's impossible, Clayton.
Brothers can't marry sisters.

11:18.934 --> 11:21.300
Oh, that's right.
You're from the south.

11:24.734 --> 11:29.233
Blanche and Clayton aren't
getting married, you airhead.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.700
Clayton and Doug are.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.734
Oh.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.333
Oh.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.700
Oh?

11:37.767 --> 11:40.266
It's a simple ceremony,
exchanging rings

11:40.333 --> 11:42.934
and affirming our commitment
to each other.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.400
It's not a big, fancy wedding.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.834
Although we are registered
at Neiman-Marcus.

11:51.033 --> 11:56.066
You have pulled some stunts in
your day, but this takes the cake.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.500
I cannot believe what I just heard.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.734
I refuse to have any part of this!

12:00.800 --> 12:03.533
Blanche.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.100
So, butch, sun-dance...

12:10.734 --> 12:12.567
who gets to throw the bouquet?

12:27.133 --> 12:30.800
The winner of tonight's volunteer
vanguard award is

12:30.867 --> 12:32.567
Rose Nylund.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.467
The crowd goes wild.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.300
Oh.

12:38.367 --> 12:41.266
Thank you. Thank you.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.133
What a surprise.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.033
I'm absolutely speechless...
except for the one I prepared.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.533
Laughter from the crowd.

12:53.734 --> 12:54.967
First of all,

12:55.033 --> 12:57.100
I'd like to thank
all the little people

12:57.166 --> 12:59.300
who have made tonight possible.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.633
Thank you, little people.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.934
Smile for the photographers.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.600
Wave to the fans.

13:12.934 --> 13:15.467
Rose, they're about
to announce the winner.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.567
I wish Blanche would've come
to see me win my award.

13:18.633 --> 13:23.900
This thing with Doug and Clayton
has been rough on her.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.533
Bringing me up to speed,

13:25.600 --> 13:29.533
it's the brother marrying
a gay cop thing, right?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.533
That's a big part of it.

13:32.667 --> 13:36.867
I don't see the problem.
They make a lovely couple.

13:37.367 --> 13:40.734
Well, maybe lovely
isn't the right word.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.900
They certainly make
a husky couple.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.333
Ladies...

13:48.033 --> 13:50.767
I think a toast is in order.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.900
Here's to the woman of the hour.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.900
A woman whose grace,
kindness, warmth,

13:55.967 --> 13:59.100
and concern for others
is an inspiration to us all.

13:59.166 --> 14:02.233
Here's to... Blanche.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.834
And he's mad at her. Think what
he's going to say about me.

14:08.233 --> 14:11.233
-You don't know how much--
-I'm not here for you.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.567
I realized this is
a very important night for Rose,

14:14.633 --> 14:17.033
and that's why I came.
Just don't mind me.

14:20.533 --> 14:21.800
To Rose.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.200
I liked his toast
to Blanche better.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.333
May I have your attention, please?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.600
It's the moment
you've been waiting for.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.100
But before we hand out
the award,

14:39.166 --> 14:42.533
I want to thank everyone who
made this evening possible,

14:42.600 --> 14:46.200
especially my daughter Dorothy.
Dorothy, stand up and take a bow.

14:55.633 --> 15:00.433
If I'm not mistaken, all the
waiters were whistling at me.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.266
Maybe they never saw anyone
eat a steak that fast.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.166
Ok. On with the award.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.300
Oh, God. This is it.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.667
-Break a leg.
-Good luck.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.900
Oh, please, oh, please.

15:13.967 --> 15:17.500
The winner of this year's volunteer
vanguard award is, Rose...

15:17.567 --> 15:20.367
-Yes!
-...hand me that glass of water, please.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.200
Wow. What a surprise.

15:31.266 --> 15:33.533
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in history,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.100
we have a posthumous winner,
Agnes Bradshaw.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.734
It's a fix!

15:43.800 --> 15:45.834
She's dead!

15:45.900 --> 15:48.033
She doesn't need that
on her mantel.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.600
She's on her mantel!

15:55.567 --> 15:57.533
At this time,
the awards committee

15:57.600 --> 16:01.066
would like to ask Agnes' dear friend
and our favorite runner-up,

16:01.133 --> 16:03.633
Rose Nylund to accept
the award for her.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.567
What a surprise.

16:21.633 --> 16:24.700
I am absolutely speechless

16:24.767 --> 16:27.967
except for the one
that I have prepared.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.200
Laughter from the audience.

16:31.967 --> 16:35.467
What can I say about
my good friend Agnes?

16:35.533 --> 16:38.700
I'll never forget the last time
I spoke to her.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.900
She said,
"Rose, I don't understand you.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.367
You work so much harder
than the rest of us."

16:46.500 --> 16:49.667
And I remember I said,
"Couldn't this wait just a minute?

16:49.734 --> 16:52.000
I'm reading to the blind."

16:53.800 --> 16:57.300
-That's enough, Rose.
-But it's so golden.

16:57.367 --> 16:58.433
Let it go.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.400
Come on. Let it go.
Let it go, you loser!

17:04.100 --> 17:06.767
Thank you, Rose.
Give her a big hand.

17:08.767 --> 17:12.033
Honey, I'm so sorry.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.233
Dorothy, I'd like you
to meet Irving Kapella.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.734
He did the ice sculptures.
Aren't they nice?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.600
75% off.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.767
Irving would like to take you out
for some cappuccino

17:26.834 --> 17:28.433
and salsa dancing.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.700
No, maybe some other time.

17:30.767 --> 17:33.567
Hey. I thought we had a deal.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.800
Ma.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.400
What's he talking about?

17:36.467 --> 17:38.000
What kind of deal?

17:38.066 --> 17:41.533
-Pussycat, you know I love you--
-You sold me, didn't you?

17:43.233 --> 17:45.000
I panicked.
I had no budget.

17:45.066 --> 17:46.800
Oh, my God.

17:46.867 --> 17:49.000
Now it all makes sense,

17:49.066 --> 17:52.233
why the hatcheck guy serenaded me
with "Moon River",

17:52.300 --> 17:55.467
why the chef gave me
that large cut of beef,

17:55.533 --> 17:59.166
why the busboy did that thing
with his tongue.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.266
Ma, how could you do this?

18:01.333 --> 18:04.567
Ok. Hey, Irving, sorry.
Our deal's off.

18:04.633 --> 18:06.133
She doesn't want to go out.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.567
We shook on it and everything.

18:08.633 --> 18:11.166
I'll go out with you.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.934
Instead of her, I get you?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.900
-Right.
-Ok.

18:16.934 --> 18:20.066
It's so good
to see you again, Blanche.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.633
And who have we here?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.834
Hello. I'm Susan Dodd.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.700
I'm Clayton, Blanche's brother.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.100
This is Doug. He's my--

18:27.166 --> 18:30.867
Fire! Everybody out!

18:35.500 --> 18:36.633
Small fire.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.166
It's out now.

18:44.734 --> 18:48.333
So... who's for decaf?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.133
Smooth.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.633
Blanche, how could you?

18:55.700 --> 18:59.467
What did you mean when you told me
you could accept my being gay?

18:59.533 --> 19:03.667
It's ok so long as I was
celibate or didn't fall in love?

19:03.734 --> 19:06.533
Doug's a part of the family,
my family.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.600
If you don't like it, you don't have
to be a part of my family.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.934
(sad music playing)

19:20.900 --> 19:22.934
Blanche, I've been thinking
about Clayton and Doug,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.967
-and I have a question.
-What?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.734
Why do men have nipples?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.767
I have no idea.

19:35.834 --> 19:40.767
Is it because God has humor and
isn't as uptight as the rest of us?

19:40.834 --> 19:43.500
Easy for you to say.

19:43.567 --> 19:46.033
It's not your brother
who's marrying a man.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.500
It's not like my family's guys
never kissed a man.

19:49.567 --> 19:52.000
Of course, that was business.

19:54.066 --> 19:58.200
Although there was that one hit man
with the flower in his lapel,

19:58.266 --> 20:01.734
he'd hold the kiss of death
a little longer than necessary.

20:02.967 --> 20:05.834
Look, I can accept
the fact that he's gay,

20:05.900 --> 20:09.467
but why slip a ring
on this guy's finger

20:09.533 --> 20:11.533
so the whole world knows?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.200
Why did you marry George?

20:13.700 --> 20:15.800
We loved each other.

20:15.867 --> 20:18.033
We wanted to make
a lifetime commitment,

20:18.100 --> 20:19.533
wanted everybody to know.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.133
That's what Clayton wants too.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.100
Everyone wants someone
to grow old with.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.233
Shouldn't everyone
have that chance?

20:26.300 --> 20:31.367
Oh, Sophia, I think I see
what you're getting at.

20:31.433 --> 20:32.700
I don't think you do.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.734
Blanche, will you marry me?

20:41.900 --> 20:44.166
Thank you, Sophia.

20:44.233 --> 20:45.633
I need to talk to them.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.600
Fine, but I'll need an answer.
I'm not waiting for you forever.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.667
Oh, Rose, honey,
you feeling better?

20:55.734 --> 20:57.667
I'm still so ashamed.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.834
Oh, nobody will remember
you even making that scene.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.100
When we left, everybody was still
talking about Dorothy

21:03.166 --> 21:05.300
leading that busboy conga line.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.033
Besides, there's always next year.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.333
Well, I've made a decision.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.133
I'm going to throw
myself into charity.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.900
I'll spend all my free time making
other people's lives better.

21:17.967 --> 21:20.767
I lost sight of the real goal.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.333
It isn't about fancy banquets.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.600
It isn't about getting
your name in the paper.

21:25.667 --> 21:28.266
It isn't about winning
the award next year.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.834
There now.
That's the spirit.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.800
It's about getting that dead
woman's name off of this one.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.800
We have to talk.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.834
There's nothing to talk about.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.800
I wasn't speaking to you.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.000
I have just one question.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.667
Ok.

21:52.734 --> 21:54.767
Do you love him?

21:55.266 --> 21:57.266
What do you mean?

21:57.333 --> 21:59.400
See, he's my baby brother.

21:59.467 --> 22:03.166
I've always felt it was my
responsibility to look out for him.

22:03.233 --> 22:06.700
I can't just let him get married
to just anybody.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.800
So do you love him?

22:08.867 --> 22:10.533
I do, very much.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.567
Good, 'cause so do I.

22:12.633 --> 22:13.867
You mean that, Blanche?

22:13.934 --> 22:18.834
Doug loves what I am,
not what he wishes I were.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.600
I guess I deserve that.

22:20.667 --> 22:21.867
I guess you do.

22:21.934 --> 22:25.133
This is very difficult for me.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.667
I still can't say I understand
what you're doing,

22:28.734 --> 22:34.000
but I do intend to try to respect
your decision to do it.

22:34.066 --> 22:35.633
I want you to be happy.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.867
I am happy, Blanche.

22:37.934 --> 22:39.166
I know.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.433
Are you telling me you're ready to
have a brand-new brother-in-law?

22:49.900 --> 22:51.266
I suppose I am.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.633
Now, look here.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.367
Now, he's not perfect.

22:57.433 --> 23:00.300
Has a stubborn streak
and a bad temper.

23:00.367 --> 23:01.633
And he snores.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.900
That'll just be our little secret.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.433
Hey, come here.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.834
(theme music playing)
