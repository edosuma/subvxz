00:06.507 --> 00:08.851
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.909 --> 00:11.150
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:11.211 --> 00:13.885
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.927
These are their stories.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.698
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.668
That's all I can spare right now.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.068
You want my kids living on Happy Meals?

00:28.262 --> 00:30.333
Sandi, I shouldn't even be here.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.343
Why are you being this way, Danny?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.343
You know where you wanna be.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.016
(SIREN BLARING)

00:43.076 --> 00:47.388
Sammy's raving about this smoked
salmon he found in Nova Scotia.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.721
Lockport.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.457
Okay.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.730
You went there this morning.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.026
Mom, she has kids.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.730
They're not your kids.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.841
Kelly called.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.969
She needs to talk to you.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.542 --> 01:17.419
Yeah, hi, honey. It's Daddy. Put Mommy on.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.419
It's Dad.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.427
You just got in?

01:23.483 --> 01:25.463
DANNY: Yes. You know, the traffic. What's up?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.830
I won't be able to make it this afternoon.
My sister's coming in for the day.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.164
Oh, no, that's not acceptable.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.034
You have to call them and tell
them that we'll be there.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.037
We'll talk tonight.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.477
Don't start with me, Mom, okay?

01:50.677 --> 01:52.179
ANNA: Mike's coming in from Binghamton.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.521
All the cousins can be together.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.187
- What date is that?
- The fourth.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.224
I can't. It's the first day of Sukkoth.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.724
Sukkoth, the Festival of the Booths.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.961
And don't try to tell me
that sounds any weirder

02:06.026 --> 02:07.733
than the Feast of the Transfiguration.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.571
Mom hasn't seen your kids since,
what, just before Easter.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.377
I know.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.275
Maybe I'll just drive up one
Sunday with Jordie and Sharon.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.416
Is everything okay with you and Danny?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.512
You keep asking that. Yes.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.824
The business just takes up
a lot of his time.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.755
I have to run.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.558
Housekeeper leaves at 4:00, and I don't want
the kids coming home to an empty house.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.958
Tell Mom I'll call her tonight.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.196
Kelly,

02:39.459 --> 02:41.132
we can still talk.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.427
(SCREAMING)

03:33.814 --> 03:35.452
(KELLY SCREAMING)

04:25.398 --> 04:28.470
The lady who drove the kids home
from school found her about 5:30.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.878
Where was Mr. Sussman?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.041
Oh, he got home from work at 6:15.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.846
We were already here.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.386
He looked pretty shook-up.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.785
We'll see.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.426
See the hand spread across her neck?

04:42.482 --> 04:44.155
It's almost a foot wide.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.794
And this bruise here.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.261
See? Knuckle marks.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.800
Smaller hand.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.403
Yeah. A second assailant.
Came from that side.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.962
She didn't stand a chance.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.735
Oh, but she fought back.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.538
Her nails are torn.

05:04.404 --> 05:09.353
Threads from a gauze bandage?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.855
Now, that's

05:14.781 --> 05:16.419
antiseptic cream.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.189
One of them might have been
wearing a bandage.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.929
She came over the top of the hood

05:30.564 --> 05:32.441
to get away from them.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.074
But why did she go back in the car?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.092
The way out.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.261
Instead of overwhelming her

05:51.318 --> 05:52.729
as soon as she got out of the car,

05:52.786 --> 05:55.460
they hesitated.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.626
They gave her an opening.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.428
And then when they regained control,

06:02.128 --> 06:03.835
they used excessive force to kill her.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.205
Amateurs.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.151
(STUTTERING)
I thought that other detective I talked to,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.383
he was running things.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.585
Your borough president called
the police commissioner.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.457
That's how the case came to us.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.928
Your family's prominent in the community.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.330
Well, my father was a very important man.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.958
He helped a lot of people.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.902
Children, come in the kitchen with Grandma.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.232
Yeah, go ahead.

06:42.869 --> 06:46.840
It's a terrible thing they had
to find their mother that way.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.921
Sussman Kosher Foods.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.088
I see your trucks around all the time.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.728
Everything good between
you and your employees?

06:59.786 --> 07:00.992
Yeah, we have no complaints.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.863
You and Mrs. Sussman?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.535
Anything we should know about?

07:08.228 --> 07:10.572
(STUTTERING)
Everything was fine.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.176
The kids are doing well. We had our health.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.707
You have something in your eyes?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.273
No. Why?

07:21.408 --> 07:24.878
Blinking your eyes a lot, that usually
means you have something in your eyes.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.152
Or that your stress level has gone up.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.783
It's called the blink rate.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.351
Well, of course, I'm under a lot of stress.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.863
Of course.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.371
Do you know where your wife
was earlier this afternoon?

07:41.428 --> 07:44.875
Her sister Anna had come down
from Albany for the day.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.740
Kelly was meeting her in the city.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.871
Would she have been wearing any jewelry?

07:50.670 --> 07:53.116
She always had her wedding ring

07:53.173 --> 07:54.777
and a necklace

07:54.841 --> 07:57.822
that I bought her for our 10th anniversary.

07:58.578 --> 08:03.049
It had three diamonds,
for me and each of the kids.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.929
She always told me everything was fine.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.637
She was very private about her marriage.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.832
But something made you ask.

08:16.896 --> 08:20.105
Our mother had a stroke a few months ago.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.271
I was calling Kelly late at night

08:22.335 --> 08:23.905
with progress reports.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.582
A lot of times, Danny wasn't there.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.209
EAMES: Where did she say he was?

08:28.975 --> 08:30.852
At some religious observance.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.082
You know, prayers.

08:34.214 --> 08:38.390
What religious observance takes place
late at night outside the home?

08:38.451 --> 08:40.556
I wouldn't know. I'm not Jewish.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.490
Oh, Kelly converted.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.830
Yes.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.999
So her children could be raised
in their father's faith.

08:53.099 --> 08:56.103
Kelly was familiar
with the Jewish traditions?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.073
She had to be.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.783
The Sussmans are a very religious family.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.852
Could you write down the dates and the times

09:04.911 --> 09:07.187
that you called her at home?

09:08.848 --> 09:11.260
There are three daily prayers
in the Jewish tradition

09:11.317 --> 09:13.695
and a man might leave the home
to go pray with the minion,

09:13.753 --> 09:15.130
with nine other men.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.030
Sussman might have had a
legitimate reason to be out.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.093
GOREN: Except that the
last prayer takes place

09:20.160 --> 09:21.195
in the early evening.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.569
Which Mrs. Sussman would have known,

09:22.629 --> 09:24.836
being familiar with the traditions.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.309
She was covering for her husband.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.743
Seems to be part of her MO.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.247
She didn't let on that there were problems.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.839
She was better at it than he was.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.442
Two months ago, Tuesday night, 11:10 p.m.,

09:34.507 --> 09:36.851
he made a withdrawal for a
thousand bucks from an ATM

09:36.910 --> 09:39.220
on the 600 block of Cuthpert Boulevard.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.622
What's the date on that?

09:40.680 --> 09:44.184
There was a call to a business on Cuthpert.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.629
Here. Same day, from his cell phone,

09:48.688 --> 09:52.226
at 5:00 p.m. to Stan's Show Supplies.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.798
One block down from the ATM.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.802
CALOS: Sussman, one of his checks bounced.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.473
We were holding his order until
he came up with one grand cash.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.776
What was in his order?

10:04.838 --> 10:06.408
I don't remember. Show stuff.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.682
You mean, like in Stan's Show stuff?
Maybe we should ask Stan.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.619
There is no Stan. There's Mr. Harland,

10:11.678 --> 10:13.487
and he's gonna be back here in an hour,

10:13.546 --> 10:15.116
and I gotta get these orders out.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.890
We'll write you a note, how you were
helping with a murder investigation.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.333
Now, Sussman's in the food business.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.372
What does he need lighting equipment for?

10:28.428 --> 10:31.034
Sussman told me he did charity events.

10:31.097 --> 10:35.011
Rented to Firefly Enterprises for
delivery on 10th Avenue in Manhattan.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.049
Spotlights, glitter ball, smoke machine.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.679
What's this abbreviation for?

10:40.740 --> 10:44.711
A bubble bath setup.
It's a clear Lucite bathtub.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.446
Charity events.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.357
Charity must be the girl
who takes the bubble baths.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.421
(LOUIE GRUNTING)

10:57.423 --> 11:00.370
Hey, how long I gotta wait in the car?

11:01.127 --> 11:03.733
Huh? Don't we gotta do a thing tonight?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.508
Next time will be on the house, baby.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.814
It's gonna take at least an hour

11:12.872 --> 11:14.613
to get all the way up there.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.325
Since when did you grow
a brain, huh? Come on.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.223
PODELL: Sussman's got the lease
till the end of the year.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.960
After that, it's available.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.933
- EAMES: Why'd he close up?
- I don't know.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.367
Business was good.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.405
GOREN: Is there a problem with the lights?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.406
Fuse box blew three weeks ago.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.497
Just like that?

11:37.564 --> 11:40.738
Well, two days later I got a
letter from Sussman's lawyer

11:40.800 --> 11:44.043
wanting to break the lease on
account of the electrical problem.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.151
- Do you mind if we have a look?
- No, go ahead.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.121
They poured acid behind the connector.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.262
That's blood.

12:37.557 --> 12:41.437
Well, he splashed acid on his arm.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.633
He would've had to reach in.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.208
He came over here to wash it off,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.606
and he used this to wipe his wound.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.743
Gauze fibers on Kelly Sussman.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.515
Yeah, from the bandages of the killer.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.425
He used this to cover his burn.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.394
Murderer, arsonist, jack of all trades.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.158
Yeah, master of none.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.836
The Arson Squad confirmed
they found traces of acid.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.907
So this works for you? Sussman
risking jail time for arson

13:16.963 --> 13:18.237
just to skip out on a lease?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.300
- Money's money.
- Small money.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.643
- And what's this guy doing
running a strip joint?
- You have to ask?

13:23.703 --> 13:24.807
He wasn't running it alone.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.976
He filed a change of ownership 2 months ago.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.077
He used to have a partner.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.616
Oh.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.184
And she spells it with an “i”.

13:34.113 --> 13:37.253
That's right. Sandi. Sandi Tortomassi.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.228
But I'm not a partner in the club anymore.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.992
I sold my share two months ago.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.533
Problems with your partners?

13:42.588 --> 13:44.864
No. Why would you think that?

13:44.924 --> 13:47.700
Well, we just heard that the
place was packed every night.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.639
The only reason you would sell is if
you had a beef with your partners.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.235
Not to mention there was an attempted
arson there a few weeks ago.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.043
By the way, is that something
burning? You're baking cookies.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.042
- Peanut butter.
- For my kids.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.914
And for the record, I didn't
have any beef with my partners.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.455
I wanted to pursue other interests.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.218
Like baking cookies?

14:08.448 --> 14:11.759
Your other partners, that's Daniel Sussman?

14:11.818 --> 14:14.458
- Yes. His company.
- Firefly Enterprises.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.296
The same people who own this house.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.963
We happened to notice Firefly put
up the money for this place.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.597
That was a loan, against the
return on share of the club.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.369
A loan against your return?

14:26.899 --> 14:29.607
By the way, is there a Mr. Tortomassi?

14:29.669 --> 14:32.582
He's a drunk, passed out
in a trailer park in Ohio.

14:32.638 --> 14:36.211
GOREN: Ohio? Didn't Firefly
buy a condo in Dayton?

14:36.275 --> 14:38.551
- That was for my mother.
- Another loan.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.182
You are shouldering a lot of debt.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.557
My share of the club went
to pay off the other loans.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.562
That was the arrangement when I cashed out.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.155
So, let's see, he put up the money...

14:49.455 --> 14:51.594
What was your contribution again?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.569
I chose the decor, the ambiance.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.069
I supervised the employees.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.939
Waitresses, bouncers,

15:00.099 --> 15:01.339
strippers.

15:02.368 --> 15:06.077
And that's where you have
a lot of experience, right?

15:07.673 --> 15:09.243
Oh, it's the outfit.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.379
Not exactly the standard issue

15:11.444 --> 15:13.014
Westchester soccer mom.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.919
(STUTTERING)
You're very toned and

15:18.084 --> 15:19.256
flexible.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.855
Sussman catch your act at a
strip club? Is that how you met?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.798
You know, if you're trying to humiliate me,

15:23.856 --> 15:25.392
I've heard it all before.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.604
I want you to leave now, before
my kids get up from their nap.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.767
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

15:31.831 --> 15:33.902
How did you find out where
Sandi used to work?

15:33.966 --> 15:36.378
She never told strangers
what she did for a living.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.882
Even strippers have to file W-2s.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.384
Your manager said you used
to share a place with her.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.478
Yeah, before she got the house.

15:43.543 --> 15:47.047
She had some help with that,
from this man, Daniel Sussman?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.358
Yeah, sure, Danny.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.088
He met Sandi here?

15:52.618 --> 15:55.565
Danny'd come in, throw around a lot of money.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.166
He really liked Sandi.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.404
He told her he wanted to give her the world.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.337
And she probably thought he could afford it.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.807
Sandi liked him because he was a gentleman.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.673
Bought her a house, set her up in a business.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.040
That was all his idea.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.172
Maybe her idea was to be
the next Mrs. Sussman.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.613
Sandi respected his marriage.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.550
That's why she broke up with him.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.112
She didn't want him to put his family
through a divorce on account of her.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.389
You keep putting your hand on your datebook.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.621
Hey!

16:25.318 --> 16:26.956
Hey, give me that.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.728
That's what people do when they're,
you know, they're nervous.

16:30.790 --> 16:34.670
They touch things to boost their confidence,

16:34.727 --> 16:37.867
especially when they're
trying to remember something.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.441
"Respectful to his marriage.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.140
"She dumped him."

16:43.870 --> 16:45.577
It's crib notes.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.820
And Sandi called you to tell you
what to say in case we dropped by.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.413
Let's try the truth.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.558
She wanted him to leave his wife.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.856
No. She broke up with him.

16:57.917 --> 17:01.296
- After his wife found out what he was doing.
- His wife knew?

17:01.354 --> 17:05.496
She called our place. She thought I was
the one having the affair with Danny.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.935
She called me all kinds of
names, I don't even know.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.598
You remember any of them?

17:09.996 --> 17:12.339
There was one she kept repeating.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.404
Kurva, or something like that.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.278
I couldn't understand her half
the time. She had this accent.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.647
Everybody in America knows Yiddish words.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.121
Why should Kelly be any different?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.080
GOREN: Kurva?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.722
That's a prostitute, isn't it?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.524
Where did Kelly learn a word like that?

17:32.585 --> 17:35.031
She was in the family for so long.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.658
Maybe she had occasion to hear it.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.064
The young woman who got the call

17:42.461 --> 17:44.668
said that Kelly had an accent.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.936
Kelly didn't have an accent, did she?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.618
Okay, I called her.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.590
You found out about the affair.

18:03.382 --> 18:06.693
I told Danny to stop, and he stopped.

18:07.186 --> 18:09.166
Did your daughter-in-law know?

18:10.423 --> 18:11.902
He told her.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.169
GOREN: You made sure he did.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.001
She had a right to know.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.542
You don't start fresh by keeping secrets.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.504
Is that what they were doing?
They were starting fresh?

18:22.568 --> 18:26.345
They have children, a home,
people who know and respect them.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.415
This other thing meant nothing to Danny.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.284
It meant $350 grand for
the house in Westchester,

18:31.344 --> 18:32.914
$200,000 for the strip club.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.549
Kelly knew nothing about that.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.786
GOREN: How could she not?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.954
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
disappearing from their account.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.097
Unless...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.632
Unless Danny was taking it
from the family business.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.669
My son lost his head.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.712
This really is a family business, isn't it?

18:59.772 --> 19:02.184
Relatives have invested their savings.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.811
Some of them even work here.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.379
- If they ever found out what Danny did...
- They wouldn't find out.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.719
The money was paid back.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.316
It's still a crime.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.919
And if Kelly knew what
he'd done for this woman,

19:11.984 --> 19:13.861
she might not be so forgiving.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.399
One word from her, and your
son would've gone to jail.

19:16.455 --> 19:20.426
No, no, no. Danny would never hurt Kelly.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.031
It's that woman. She had her claws into him.

19:24.096 --> 19:28.636
She called me here after I spoke
to her friend, and she said

19:28.701 --> 19:32.080
nobody was going to come
between her and Danny.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.250
She said

19:41.414 --> 19:44.691
that she had friends in that world.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.792
People who would hurt anyone
who got in her way.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.034
LOUIE: Uh-huh.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.636
Okay.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.912
You want some of this?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.815
What are you doing?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.951
We gotta get lost for a while.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.657
How about Miami?

20:13.713 --> 20:16.091
Big party town, dance all night.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.188
We could rent a boat and cruise the cooz.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.362
Hey, we driving or...

20:24.657 --> 20:27.604
SANDI: Maybe if you tell me what you're
looking for, I can save you the trouble.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.901
That really didn't work out for us.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.434
You should go next door with your kids.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.240
This warrant says I can stay and
watch, so that's what I'm gonna do.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.644
Excuse me.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.044
We found this on the floor of her garage.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.125
Is this yours?

20:51.183 --> 20:52.662
Be careful.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.221
No. It's not mine.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.157
EAMES: We found it in your garage.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.793
I don't know how it got in there.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.303
That's okay, we do.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.636
Sandi Tortomassi, you're
under arrest for murder.

21:08.467 --> 21:11.676
I didn't do it. I didn't
have any reason to do it.

21:11.737 --> 21:14.479
Getting rid of the wife gave
you a clear shot at Danny.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.486
I don't wanna marry him.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.180
Didn't your mother ever tell you?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.850
"Why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for free?"

21:20.913 --> 21:23.587
"Why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for..."

21:28.020 --> 21:30.933
So you're saying that you can
talk Danny into anything.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.697
Well, you saw the house he bought me.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.260
And the strip club.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.834
My idea.

21:35.895 --> 21:39.035
That's just money. Guys
toss money at women every day.

21:39.698 --> 21:42.736
Well, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.249
Oh? Like what?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.777
Last April, his son's birthday party.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.447
His bar mitzvah.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.785
What, Danny invited you?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.887
I brought two girls from the club.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.001
Danny told his family we were
with the trucker's union.

22:17.536 --> 22:21.211
Well, you really have this little
guy under your thumb, don't you?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.878
I can see why.

22:26.045 --> 22:30.460
Must've been some workout you gave
him in that big bedroom of yours.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.055
Sure.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.657
When the kids weren't around.

22:36.655 --> 22:40.398
And where'd you go when you had
that place with your friend?

22:40.459 --> 22:42.200
You and Danny go to a hotel?

22:43.429 --> 22:45.568
Not so often, he'd get tired of it.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.705
Good. Then you shouldn't have a problem
remembering the hotels and dates.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.287
DANNY: I can't believe she did it.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.187
She knew no matter what would have happened

23:00.246 --> 23:03.318
(STUTTERING) I would never marry
her, or someone like her.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.588
She knew that.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.352
So,

23:07.553 --> 23:09.590
we're looking for two men.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.801
Maybe former bouncers.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.298
If you can think of any names, it would help.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.397
I can't think of anybody.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.776
I can't think. I can't think!

23:19.832 --> 23:21.311
You proved that.

23:21.367 --> 23:24.837
Getting mixed up with some
bottle blonde boom-boom girl.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.880
You don't have to tell me. I know that.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.720
I shamed my family. I don't
know, what was I thinking?

23:36.882 --> 23:38.555
Well, it was worth it.

23:42.321 --> 23:46.531
Bet this girl gave you quite a ride.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.567
No wonder you were still making

23:49.628 --> 23:52.700
the drive up to Westchester
every other morning.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.406
Did you go bareback or use a condom?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.381
Condom.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.423
You buy them on the way up there or
did you keep a box next to the bed?

24:06.478 --> 24:08.253
She had them.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.959
Really? That's funny.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.791
Because we searched her room.
We didn't find anything.

24:12.851 --> 24:14.194
Bathroom either.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.530
No condom, no diaphragm, no pills.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.464
There goes that blink rate again.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.140
Do you remember the hotels
you stayed in with Sandi

24:26.198 --> 24:27.643
before you bought her the house?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.909
We've got the itemized bills from your stays.

24:31.603 --> 24:35.278
GOREN: One afternoon, you
ordered two movies, rated PG.

24:35.975 --> 24:40.048
Room service, two hamburgers, two
salads, two desserts, two massages

24:40.212 --> 24:42.021
and you used the gym.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.819
That's all in the space of four hours.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.433
When did you find the time for sex?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.905
Or was that between the
hamburger and the massage?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.538
Another missed opportunity.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.975
One of many, right, Danny?

25:12.044 --> 25:14.046
Well, how did she wiggle out of it?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.888
Did she have cramps?

25:16.415 --> 25:18.656
She said the mood wasn't right?

25:18.984 --> 25:20.361
She was worried about her kids?

25:20.419 --> 25:22.365
She just wanted to cuddle?

25:25.057 --> 25:27.663
She really kept you going, didn't she?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.406
For two years, Danny.

25:33.999 --> 25:36.240
Two years, and not once.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.843
Right, Danny? Not a once.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.554
It was okay.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.751
- I didn't mind, really.
- Oh, come on.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.317
What, are you made of marble?
You were dying for it.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.794
And she kept upping the ante.

25:52.851 --> 25:56.025
A condo for Mom, a house for the
kids, a strip club for her.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.795
A dead wife for you.

25:57.956 --> 25:58.991
No.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.905
She talked you into it.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.995
No.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.742
I would never hurt Kelly. I respected her.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.073
That's the truth.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.940
She did so much for me,
so much to make a family.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.145
Okay, Danny, that's enough.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.589
It is now clear you consider him a suspect.

26:20.646 --> 26:23.092
He's invoking his right to silence.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.093
Him. Her.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.232
Him and her. Take your pick.

26:30.289 --> 26:33.498
It won't be either unless we find
the men who did the actual killing.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.165
Well, I don't think that he has it in him.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.970
I mean, the girl played
"keep away" for two years.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.171
Ordinary man would be frustrated, angry.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.737
He's not an ordinary man, he's a murderer.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.374
- He's a child.
- I'm with him.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.847
Four hours before Kelly was killed,

26:49.908 --> 26:51.979
there were two calls from Sussman's office

26:52.044 --> 26:53.819
to a no name prepaid cell phone.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.449
Can we trace that cell phone to an owner?

26:55.514 --> 26:58.120
No. But the number turned up
in a hooker's phone book

26:58.183 --> 26:59.753
when she was busted three months ago.

26:59.818 --> 27:02.924
Yolanda Starr Corbin.
She's a Greenpoint regular.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.838
YOLANDA: All God's children need loving.

27:07.893 --> 27:11.466
Which one of God's children gave you
this number a couple of months ago?

27:13.165 --> 27:14.337
We'll just have to call it.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.106
Tell whoever answers you gave it to us.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.977
Please, don't do me like that.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.982
We already have an idea who he is.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.847
He's got a burn on his arm, right?

27:24.576 --> 27:27.989
It's Big Louie. That's what I know him by.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.782
He's armed and crazy.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.054
But you have his number.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.562
He made me take it. Said if
I get in trouble, call him.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.394
EAMES: Guess what? You're in trouble.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.562
Louie Bernoff.

27:39.625 --> 27:43.266
Priors for drug possession, lewdness.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.568
Ooh.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.632
GOREN: What's wrong with your arm?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.439
Car battery leaked.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.676
Oh.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.715
Do you know her?

27:57.042 --> 27:58.783
- Nope.
- Him?

27:59.611 --> 28:00.851
Nope.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.255
How about her?

28:06.485 --> 28:07.657
Nope.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.096
You should.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.198
Those are your hand prints around her neck.

28:11.256 --> 28:12.496
You killed her.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.935
We're gonna match your DNA to the
rag you left at the strip club

28:15.994 --> 28:17.837
when you tried to burn it down.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.970
Big trouble for Big Louie.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.206
But you can help yourself by telling us

28:24.002 --> 28:27.040
which one of these two here hired you.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.622
I checked Big Louie backwards and forwards.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.189
The phone calls are still the only thing

28:43.255 --> 28:45.633
that connect him with Sussman and the girl.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.938
- Crystal meth.
- No, thanks.

28:49.928 --> 28:53.102
It belongs to Big Louie's roommate,

28:53.699 --> 28:54.837
Nicky Ross.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.937
Big time tweaker according to the neighbors.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.709
The second killer.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.950
Oh, and the neighbor saw Big Louie

29:03.008 --> 29:05.887
lugging a large suitcase
down the stairs two days ago.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.925
EAMES: Maybe Nicky left the
cap off the toothpaste.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.458
Large pepperoni.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.866
The night before Kelly Sussman was killed.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.101
"Nashot Chayl"?

29:24.363 --> 29:26.036
GOREN: "Nashot Chayl."

29:26.098 --> 29:28.544
(STUTTERING)
Nashot, that's Hebrew.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.140
Women, woman.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.408
Figures you'd know that.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.848
But Chayl, I don't know.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.478
Valor.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.084
Nashot Chayl - is women of valor.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.252
Three years of Hebrew school.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.087
Women of valor.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.957
Sounds like a self-help group
for Jewish women.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.563
SYLVIA: Kelly came to us two months ago.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.431
She wanted a divorce.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.229
But she wanted to make sure she did
everything right by our Jewish laws.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.866
She didn't want any problems
getting custody of her kids.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.103
- EAMES: Why would there be problems?
- If she wanted custody,

30:01.166 --> 30:02.975
she'd have to convince
the religious authorities

30:03.035 --> 30:05.914
that she'd continue raising the
children in the Jewish faith.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.713
Don't family court judges decide custody?

30:08.940 --> 30:13.411
Well, judges who are elected by a community
listen to their religious leaders.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.925
Wouldn't be smart of them to alienate voters.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.984
No, it wouldn't be smart.

30:19.117 --> 30:22.655
So we help to prepare a get,
a Jewish divorce decree.

30:22.721 --> 30:25.361
Then she had to present it to
her husband for him to sign.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.335
Sounds pretty straightforward.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.041
Except Kelly had to find
two witnesses to go with her.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.973
People active in her synagogue.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.374
GOREN: She couldn't find anyone.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.208
No one wanted to be her witness.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.045
Even her rabbi wouldn't help.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.275
EAMES: The Sussman family...

30:39.338 --> 30:41.409
They carry a lot of weight in the community.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.714
Danny Sussman didn't want a divorce.

30:43.775 --> 30:47.188
He wanted a reconciliation.
But Kelly had no choice.

30:47.879 --> 30:51.383
If she didn't have a get, she'd risk
losing her kids in a custody fight.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.761
When Kelly canceled the
mediation, did she reschedule?

30:54.820 --> 30:55.855
No.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.862
So the reconciliation was off?

31:01.626 --> 31:04.573
She told me she had a better way
of getting what she wanted.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.606
Custody of her kids.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.211
I told her, no matter what,
Danny'd make a problem.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.776
You know what, Danny's
never been the problem.

31:16.842 --> 31:20.051
I mean, he doesn't have
the clout or the backbone

31:20.112 --> 31:22.285
to bend the community to his will.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.824
But his mother does.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.792
She cleaned up his mess when he stole money,

31:28.854 --> 31:31.767
and now she's fighting to save his marriage.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.563
I can't find the invoice
for the Gellis account.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.198
Do you have it?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.973
- Danny?
- I can't help it, Mom.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.341
She destroyed Kelly.
Now she's gonna destroy me.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.147
- Stop it, stop it.
- I deserve it. I brought her into our life.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.118
- Don't talk like that.
- I deserve what happens to me.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.520
You deserve what you let happen.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.491
We have friends, influence, respect.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.426
They don't respect me.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.895
They respect the name your father gave you.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.659
The name you gave your son.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.629
If you can't stand up for yourself,

32:08.693 --> 32:10.934
at least stand up for the name.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.102
I wish Dad was still here.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.374
It's better he's not.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.628
MRS. GERRIGAN: Kelly was working
in one of the big hotels

32:32.684 --> 32:35.221
in New York City when she met Danny.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.931
She told me he was very sweet.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.269
A real gentleman.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.774
She didn't tell me he was a Jewish gentleman.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.071
And that bothered you?

32:47.132 --> 32:48.372
Well,

32:49.034 --> 32:53.505
I was wishing that Kelly would
meet a nice Catholic boy.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.486
Just like I'm sure Mrs. Sussman wished

32:57.542 --> 33:00.352
her son had met a nice Jewish girl.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.789
Is that the impression that she gave you?

33:02.848 --> 33:06.057
Oh, she didn't warm up to
Kelly till after the wedding.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.394
We never even got a hug from that woman.

33:12.123 --> 33:14.330
Your daughter was a devout Catholic?

33:14.459 --> 33:16.962
Well, she grew up in the church.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.905
She sang in the choir.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.234
She loved the Virgin Mary.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.317
Well, then, converting to Judaism

33:30.909 --> 33:33.480
must have been a big decision for her.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.821
Was that something that Danny
pressured her to do?

33:35.881 --> 33:37.258
Not Danny.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.357
He just wanted to be with Kelly.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.226
They even talked about eloping.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.765
Mrs. Sussman.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.397
She made a big stink.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.699
And Kelly was stubborn.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.539
But then Kelly gave in.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.468
All of a sudden.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.511
Did she explain why?

33:59.704 --> 34:00.739
No.

34:01.172 --> 34:03.516
Two weeks later they were married.

34:08.313 --> 34:11.317
No, sir, I'm not sure what
evidence they're developing

34:11.616 --> 34:13.118
I know, but...

34:13.885 --> 34:15.193
Yes, sir.

34:16.154 --> 34:18.225
The Brooklyn DA's moving on the girl.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.793
They're tangling with some
community pressure over there.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.770
A community known as Ursula Sussman.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.670
DEAKINS: You still haven't
sold me on that yet.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.106
And what's all this?

34:26.531 --> 34:28.806
Thirteen-year-old checks from her account.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.847
Am I gonna kick myself for asking?

34:32.971 --> 34:36.418
This one's for $75,000 made out to cash.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.288
Just before her son's wedding 13 years ago.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.121
Could've been for the dress,
for the reception hall.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.956
The second check is the same amount.

34:47.886 --> 34:51.993
$75,000 to cash three months later, in April.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.338
And it's just a week after her...

34:57.929 --> 35:01.172
Her grandson was born.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.743
I need to see my friend, Max.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.547
He's a rabbi.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.817
We need to get Danny and his mother in here.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.523
He knows we have this meeting?

35:20.585 --> 35:22.963
He's usually back from lunch by now.

35:23.021 --> 35:26.434
I'm sorry. There was a
long line at the bodega.

35:28.226 --> 35:32.333
Did Detective Eames explain that
we needed some things clarified?

35:32.397 --> 35:34.343
DANNY: Yes. About my marriage.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.846
Yeah, right. You and your wife
were trying to make a fresh start.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.882
Yes. We were trying.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.383
EAMES: Your idea or hers?

35:41.439 --> 35:44.852
Well, both. We both wanted
to go for counseling.

35:45.243 --> 35:48.190
Sussman pickles. I've always been a big fan.

35:48.446 --> 35:51.620
You made appointments
at the Nashot Chayl Center?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.194
Yes. Kelly arranged it.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.092
The people there told us
when she first contacted them,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.658
Kelly was dead set on a divorce.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.227
Oh, that's between a husband and a wife.

36:02.293 --> 36:06.435
These people shouldn't be blabbering
about confidential information.

36:07.298 --> 36:10.802
Well, I guess it really
doesn't matter now, does it?

36:13.238 --> 36:14.649
I guess not.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.379
You felt... Well, you still feel guilty.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.325
I mean, you would have given
her anything she wanted

36:24.382 --> 36:25.918
in the divorce.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.028
Even custody of the kids?

36:28.086 --> 36:32.262
She was a good mother and fighting
over custody would have hurt them.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.465
What if Kelly went back
to the Catholic church?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.165
Under Jewish law,

36:37.429 --> 36:40.740
the kids wouldn't have been considered
Jewish anymore, would they?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.107
DANNY: She wouldn't have done that.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.942
What, someone who'd been hurt?

36:44.869 --> 36:47.873
Who was angry, divorced, alone?

36:47.939 --> 36:49.509
Who knows what she'd do?

36:52.744 --> 36:57.420
Well, thank heaven there was someone
in the family still thinking straight.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.925
Right, Mrs. Sussman?

37:01.286 --> 37:02.959
I mean, if it wasn't for you,

37:03.021 --> 37:05.592
Kelly might've run off
with your grandchildren

37:05.657 --> 37:07.967
and turned them into who knows what.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.503
Kelly just needed some time
to get over her anger.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.845
Well, she got over it, all right.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.814
Do you wanna know what she
told them at the center?

37:21.840 --> 37:23.114
She told them that

37:23.174 --> 37:25.814
she had a way of getting what she wanted.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.790
Not from you, but from your mother.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.527
What do you suppose she meant by that?

37:31.583 --> 37:34.029
We don't know. We're not mind readers.

37:34.385 --> 37:35.887
Neither are we.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.925
But we're pretty good at connecting the dots.

37:39.991 --> 37:43.336
First dot, Big Louie Bernoff.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.508
You might know him as a murder suspect.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.644
But six years ago, he was
also the owner of a van

37:49.701 --> 37:52.614
he bought used from his
father, the mechanic.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.685
GOREN: That sound familiar?

37:56.875 --> 38:01.381
Because your dad helped Louie's father

38:01.446 --> 38:04.290
immigrate from the Soviet Union,

38:04.349 --> 38:07.922
I mean, just like he helped
hundreds of other refugees.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.957
You dad even gave him the contract to
service your company's delivery vans.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.965
So, that means nothing.

38:14.025 --> 38:17.666
Your father helped hundreds
of people, thousands.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.977
This is... It's just a... Just a...

38:22.167 --> 38:23.305
Fluke?

38:25.236 --> 38:28.547
It could be a fluke if Sandi Tortomassi

38:28.973 --> 38:31.180
hired him to kill Kelly.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.346
But she didn't.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.560
Your wife wasn't a threat to her.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.232
Your wife was a threat to your mother.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.667
Oh, that's just ridiculous.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.766
Kelly had something on her.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.171
Something so shameful

38:56.034 --> 38:59.880
that Kelly thought your mother
might give up her grand-kids

38:59.938 --> 39:01.144
to keep it quiet.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.685
That's not true.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.186
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.589
Second dot.

39:12.450 --> 39:17.092
Your pregnant Catholic fiancée.

39:18.990 --> 39:23.302
Three words that made
your mother very unhappy.

39:23.494 --> 39:24.495
That's okay.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.803
Kelly's mother wasn't too
thrilled about it either.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.243
Especially when she
converted out of the blue.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.249
Or should I say out of the green?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.717
EAMES: That summer after you were married,

39:37.775 --> 39:40.847
Kelly bought her mother
a house for a $150,000?

39:41.412 --> 39:45.952
Yes, that was a settlement that she'd
gotten for an old car accident.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.762
Third dot.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.663
Two $75,000 checks

39:55.360 --> 39:58.500
drawn from your mother's
account 13 years ago.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.842
Kelly bought the house with those checks.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.051
The first one

40:09.741 --> 40:13.780
is dated one week before Kelly converted.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.855
The second one is dated two
days after your son's Bris,

40:17.916 --> 40:22.092
after his circumcision that
welcomed him into the faith.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.537
If anyone found out,

40:33.197 --> 40:35.006
all the good will,

40:35.700 --> 40:38.647
all the influence your father garnered

40:39.804 --> 40:43.081
from his good work and his religious devotion

40:44.075 --> 40:46.077
would have disappeared like

40:48.579 --> 40:50.320
smoke in the wind.

40:52.216 --> 40:55.823
Your family name would have been
disgraced, and the family business.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.465
Kelly was gonna tell everyone.

41:03.695 --> 41:08.508
Unless your mother let her
have custody of your kids.

41:08.566 --> 41:09.636
Mom,

41:10.935 --> 41:12.471
tell me you...

41:13.304 --> 41:16.342
She did. She hired Big Louie
to kill your wife

41:16.407 --> 41:19.945
and plant her necklace
in your girlfriend's garage.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.850
GOREN: I'll bet

41:23.915 --> 41:26.987
that your mother doesn't think
that she even did anything wrong.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.999
I'll bet that she thinks that she was just
cleaning up another one of your messes.

41:36.928 --> 41:39.966
Aren't you gonna get angry at her?
She killed your wife!

41:43.601 --> 41:45.444
Come on, Danny.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.609
When are you gonna grow up?

41:50.908 --> 41:55.152
When are you gonna
take your balls back from her?

42:00.918 --> 42:02.329
How could you, Mom?

42:04.489 --> 42:06.526
How in the hell could you?

42:08.826 --> 42:10.737
If you'd only listened.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.211
I told you she was no good for you.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.039
So I did what I had to do.

42:20.438 --> 42:24.284
For the family. Always for the family.

42:24.475 --> 42:27.479
What family? You killed the family!

42:29.947 --> 42:32.484
You're under arrest,
Mrs. Sussman, for murder.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.188
Please turn around.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.737
Danny, do something.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.734
Danny,

42:46.164 --> 42:47.666
do something!

43:02.613 --> 43:03.921
She broke the laws of her faith,

43:03.981 --> 43:05.892
so what does she do about it?

43:05.950 --> 43:07.691
You commit one sin,

43:08.052 --> 43:10.498
the next ones come a little easier.
