00:01.210 --> 00:04.247
(The Blow's "True Affection"
playing)

00:05.214 --> 00:07.125
(Andy breathing heavily, laughs)

00:07.174 --> 00:08.163
Wow.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.831
Wow yourself.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.171
(both laugh)

00:12.679 --> 00:14.465
When you said you wanted
to check out this house for sale,

00:15.891 --> 00:17.677
this is not what I expected.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.302
I had to get a feel for the place
somehow, you know?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.813
.l‘ Underneath the sea .l‘

00:27.236 --> 00:29.852
Let's get the realtor back here,
check out some other houses.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.071
This can be our weird, kinky thing.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.358
I thought what we did on the stairs
was our weird, kinky thing.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.788
(laughs)

00:38.830 --> 00:39.956
It's got such a great view.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.498
It's on the ravine.
I mean, it's 20 minutes from work.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.788
Who wouldn't want to live here?

00:47.214 --> 00:48.545
I'm glad you think so.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.251
I put in an offer.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.211
(gasps) You're buying it?

00:52.261 --> 00:53.250
Uh-huh, yeah.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.345
So... live with me.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.807
It comes down to this:

01:00.852 --> 01:01.887
I know what I want,

01:01.937 --> 01:05.600
and I want to wake up every day
in this house with you.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.941
So the question is, Andy,
what do you want?

01:10.529 --> 01:12.190
.l‘ Wanted you nearer .l‘

01:12.239 --> 01:13.604
Shut up!

01:13.657 --> 01:16.649
Yep. He asked me to live with him,
and I said yes.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.408
- Just like that?
- Well, no.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.660
I mean, we fooled around
a little bit more,

01:20.706 --> 01:21.991
and I took a look at the great view,

01:22.040 --> 01:23.780
and then I said yes.

01:25.794 --> 01:26.783
What?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.786
I don't know. It's just...

01:29.464 --> 01:32.797
You move in with a guy, and it's for real.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.169
You're not playing around anymore.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.208
Are you ready for that?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.297
Of course not.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.132
You know, fake it till you make it, right?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.130
I'm kidding.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.469
Look, domestication
seems to be working out for you.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.682
Yeah, but it's kind of a different situation.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.472
Dex and l have a long history together,

01:48.609 --> 01:50.725
- and Leo--
- Yeah, but it's working, right?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.393
Sure. I've been home for dinner
the last three nights.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.937
What? Dex learned how to cook?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.481
It's tacos from a box, but it's a start.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.820
I probably should have put in
for a desk transfer sooner,

02:02.581 --> 02:05.118
And my baby daddy/
ex-boyfriend/new boyfriend,

02:05.167 --> 02:07.533
- whatever he is, he's happy, so...
- And are you happy?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.122
Yeah. Leo's got a real family.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.331
- That makes me happy.
- That's good.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.793
(Dov) Ready for action. Loaded for bear.
Eye of the tiger.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.798
- (Gail) Yeah, smell of the goat.
- (Dov) It's man smell, baby.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.709
Actually, Gail's right.
You do kind of stink, man.

02:17.763 --> 02:18.798
Damn right I do.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.633
Six hours of surveillance
will do that to you.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.762
Hey, shut up, Dov.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.595
Seriously, you two have been
on your little secret detail for a week now.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.853
We know this because you mention it
every single day.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.054
Not every day.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.932
(indistinct conversations)

02:31.985 --> 02:34.362
- All right, listen up.
- Hold up, Frank.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.610
(speaks indistinctly)

02:40.494 --> 02:42.610
Peckstein.
You two are dismissed from parade.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.994
Join Detective Boyd.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.879
Everything all right, rooks?

02:54.925 --> 02:55.914
- Yeah! Good.
- Great.

02:55.967 --> 02:56.956
It's outstanding, sir.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.509
So if we just got cut loose,

03:03.558 --> 03:04.968
why are they still treating us like rookies?

03:05.811 --> 03:06.891
Food chain, I guess.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.720
We're probably gonna be rookies
till they get new recruits.

03:09.773 --> 03:10.888
Well, how long is that gonna be?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.977
I don't know. A year, maybe two.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.311
That sucks.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.858
You know what sucks?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.520
ls Dov and Gail getting a special assignment
with Boyd.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.859
Yeah. Boyd runs
the guns and gangs task force.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.740
I mean, it's gotta be somethin' huge.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.196
No, you know what?
It's probablyjust a hassle--

03:24.246 --> 03:26.202
just overtime and paperwork.
Who needs it?

03:26.248 --> 03:27.954
Yeah, totally. I mean,
we're out on the streets.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.864
- They're stuck doing some stupid...
- Yeah.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.079
- Whatever. Who cares?
- Who cares?

03:35.257 --> 03:37.043
- Dov wouldn't tell you, huh?
- No. I offered him money.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.299
I said I'd do his dishes
for a week--nothin'.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.380
lt's--it's killing me.
(cell phone rings)

03:41.430 --> 03:42.545
Hey, just hang on.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.428
Diaz.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.679
Hey, Edie. What's up? What?
Yeah, I can hear that.

03:48.729 --> 03:52.017
No, we--look, just--just hang on.
Just hang on.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.556
lt's Dov's girlfriend.
There's some guy banging on her door.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.395
- She's really freaked out.
- Okay, well, let's go.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.810
Yeah, but what about personal involvement?

03:57.863 --> 03:58.852
I mean, shouldn't we call in for the--

03:58.905 --> 04:01.567
(Andy punches button, siren wails)
- (Chris) Or not.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.823
(man pounding)
Open the door, Edie!

04:03.869 --> 04:05.075
(Edie) Leave me alone!

04:05.120 --> 04:07.953
- Just let me in!
- No! lwon't!

04:07.998 --> 04:09.659
Baby, just come out!

04:09.708 --> 04:10.697
- No!
- Just come out.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.953
| just want to talk to--
| just want to see you!

04:13.003 --> 04:15.619
- Leave me alone!
- Open the damn door, Edie!

04:15.672 --> 04:17.412
- Open the door, Edie!
- (Chris) Excuse me!

04:20.427 --> 04:21.758
(man) My mistake. Sorry, officer.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.884
I'm really sorry about all this, officer.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.015
l was just having a misunderstanding
with my girlfriend.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.049
Hey, Edie, it's Chris. It's okay.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.718
Could you please just
get him out of here?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.353
- Huh. Is this your car?
- Uh, no.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.602
- Yes.
- (Edie) ljust want him to leave.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.437
Hmm. What's this in the back?

04:38.487 --> 04:40.443
- (Chris) He's banging on your door and screaming--
- (Edie) He's my ex.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.445
- I don't know.
- Can I see some |.D., please?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.823
(Edie) He just got into town from Montreal.
I told him I didn't want to see him,

04:44.868 --> 04:46.233
but he doesn't listen!

04:46.286 --> 04:47.696
- Do you want me to call Dov?
- No.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.909
No, please. Dov--Dov
doesn't need to know about this.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.073
So you didn't know there was
an electronic money counter

04:53.126 --> 04:54.115
or a duffel bag in the back?

04:54.669 --> 04:55.829
Uh, no.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.124
So it's not your money counter or your car?

05:00.175 --> 05:01.631
- Diaz.
- Yeah?

05:01.676 --> 05:05.419
Uh, Mr. Lessing here
seems to be unsure if this is his.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.847
Do we need a warrant to check
an ownerless vehicle?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.849
Well, the vehicle has no stated owner.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.809
Contents of said vehicle
have no obvious or immediate owner.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.143
So no rights to exclusive possession.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.682
- Good to go then.
- Yeah.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.484
At which point,
Officer Diaz restrained Mr. Lessing,

05:24.533 --> 05:25.613
and I looked in the back of the vehicle,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.069
- finding--
- Lessing?

05:27.661 --> 05:31.904
It's gotta be over $1 million US. currency
and a money counter, too.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.822
Oh, and we found a loaded gun
in the glove box.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.833
- I mean, this is big, isn't it? Right?
- Wow. Uh...

05:36.878 --> 05:38.414
I mean, this is a major amount of cash

05:38.463 --> 05:40.704
for what I'm guessing
is some highly illegal activity.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.547
I mean, money laundering,

05:42.592 --> 05:44.253
- counterfeiting, maybe, something.
- Diaz.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.218
The less you say right now, the better.
Trust me.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.514
Why are you guys acting like
we ran over the mayor? What's going on?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.720
Your collar is Gabriel Lessing,

05:52.769 --> 05:55.351
up-and-comer in the Landry bike club
out of Montreal,

05:55.397 --> 05:57.558
and he was here to buy
$2 million worth of heroin.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.730
That was gonna open up
the largest drug pipeline in the country,

06:02.779 --> 06:06.863
and for six months
my task force has been on it.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.275
So that's... the big operation
everyone's been on?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.193
(Boyd) That's right.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.783
And you two just blew it.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.323
(re-zips duffel bag)

06:18.545 --> 06:20.877
What exactly got you to Lessing
in the first place?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.378
We went there for the disturbance,

06:22.424 --> 06:23.880
and then I saw the money in the car,

06:23.925 --> 06:25.961
and I thought it looked suspicious.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.876
Do you have any idea how many people
are involved in this thing,

06:27.929 --> 06:29.885
how many people I could've arrested?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.013
Bergen, the Landrys!

06:32.058 --> 06:34.640
I think we can still salvage this thing.
I mean, we got Lessing.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.426
Six months, man. Six months.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.060
Hey, that's longer than you've been
on the force, isn't it?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.347
You know, I understand
why you'd be angry, sir,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.936
but I really don't think I made a mistake.

06:43.111 --> 06:47.354
You know, the guy was driving around
with almost $2 million in cash,

06:47.407 --> 06:48.817
and he had a handgun.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.359
So |--| think she did
what any cop would've done.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.030
- Yeah.
- Oh! Officer what's-his-face agrees.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.664
Well, then,
suddenly I feel so much better.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.917
You know what, Boyd?
You run your operation in the dark,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.293
people are gonna bump into each other.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.751
How did your team lose track
of Lessing in the first place, huh?

07:04.799 --> 07:07.711
No, no. Look, Lessing wasn't supposed
to get in till Monday, okay?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.594
There was no way for me to know
that he was gonna pull in three days earlier.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.880
Okay-- well, then if you didn't know,
how are Chris and I supposed to?

07:14.559 --> 07:16.936
I don't have time to explain
every little thing to you, okay?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.185
Because right now l have to go
explain to my bosses

07:19.230 --> 07:22.017
how we blew the bust of my career!

07:26.154 --> 07:27.815
What's going on?
Did you get called in, too?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.229
Something happened, all right?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.897
Look, Andy and l--
we arrested this guy,

07:30.951 --> 07:32.031
but we didn't know that he was--

07:32.077 --> 07:35.114
Anyways, the thing is--
is that Edie called me--

07:35.163 --> 07:37.279
- Edie? Is she okay?
- Yeah. We had to go to her house.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.368
There was this guy
who was banging on her door,

07:39.417 --> 07:40.953
and that's when everything went down.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.118
Went down? Where is she?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.502
She's here, man.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.174
- Edie.
- Dov.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.585
What happened?
Is everything all right?

07:52.514 --> 07:55.301
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I was scared,

07:55.350 --> 07:57.716
and I didn't know who to call.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.884
Why didn't you call me?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.595
I didn't want to bother you, 'cause I knew
you had that big surveillance thing.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.060
Hi. Come here, Epstein.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.397
- Who is she to you?
- She's my girlfriend.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.188
She's your girlfriend.
Of course she is.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.903
You need to come with me. Right now.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.360
So you were supposed
to, uh, meet Bergen

08:17.414 --> 08:19.075
and buy the dope
with the Landrys' money.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.160
We know all that already, Gabe.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.995
That's fine. Great. Good for you.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.411
Right. Even without the dope,
that handgun will get you five to ten.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.334
Just give me a name--

08:29.384 --> 08:32.501
the guy you were supposed to make contact
with, you know? We can deal.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.761
I'm not the kind of guy
who rolls over on his own people,

08:34.806 --> 08:36.296
so you can forget about it.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.307
(chuckles) Okay.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.472
Gabe, I got this speech
I give to guys like you.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.478
It's a good speech,
but you gotta pay attention, okay?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.394
(Sam) See that door there?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.150
Can I, uh, help you with something?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.480
(Sam)There's two ways you can go out...

08:50.530 --> 08:52.816
- I'm the arresting officer, sir.
- (Sam) ...alone,

08:52.866 --> 08:53.981
- Just want to see my case through.
- (Sam) the strong man who didn't say anything...

08:54.034 --> 08:55.649
(Sam) ...and before you make it to trial,
you'll be dead.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.533
If the Landrys don't do it, Bergen will.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.787
That's one way.
The other way? With us,

09:00.832 --> 09:02.163
into witness protection.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.871
You'll be a snitch, a rat,
but you'll be alive.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.253
I know it feels like you have
other options right now.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.334
You don't.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.715
So... dead or alive--

09:12.761 --> 09:14.752
how do you want to go
out that door, Gabe?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.006
That's a good speech.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.676
So who's your contact?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.938
(sighs)

09:28.443 --> 09:29.478
Guy named Angel.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.233
I'm supposed to call him
to confirm the meeting.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.940
And what about Bergen?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.446
I don't know him.
I never met him.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.107
(Sam) So you only know Angel?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.149
I never met him either.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.865
Oh. Good.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.237
Good.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.250
(Dov, lowers voice) Okay, fine.
I know what she does for a living,

09:48.296 --> 09:50.537
but I'm not the first cop to date a dancer.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.672
...who associates with known criminals.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.709
What? Edie? No way.
No. I don't believe you.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.969
You're under strict orders
not to talk about this operation.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.847
So how does she magically know
that you're on some "big surveillance thing"?

10:00.892 --> 10:01.972
I didn't say anything.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.010
Epstein, look at yourself.
I've been there.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.349
You have a uniform.
You're cruisin' around in your squad.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.229
You get to carry a gun.
Now you're dating a stripper.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.563
You want to impress her.
Did you say anything?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.647
No, sir.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.319
Okay, maybe I said
that l was working a big case

10:19.369 --> 10:20.779
and that l was doing surveillance,
but that's it.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.410
She doesn't know anything. I swear.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.741
You better hope so.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.826
(door squeaks open)

10:29.003 --> 10:30.868
Chris! (bangs on desk) Chris!

10:34.592 --> 10:36.423
- So?
- Well, he's still in there with Oliver.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.175
What did Dov do?

10:38.221 --> 10:41.054
Look, nothing, okay?
He--he didn't do anything.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.683
Well, we know that, but--| mean,
should we be talking to Oliver?

10:44.727 --> 10:46.718
Peck, you stay on special detail.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.760
Nash, you're with Peck.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.681
Uh, Frank, Nash is on desk now.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.058
- (Chris) I'll go.
- What?

10:53.111 --> 10:55.978
I mean, if it helps the operation.

10:56.030 --> 10:59.022
(Frank) Get going.
Peck will brief you on the way.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.533
Hey, uh, let me know
what happens with Dov.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.568
Yeah.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.740
Uh, sorry.
Was I out of line?

11:08.668 --> 11:14.129
'Cause |--| know you need this desk job
for your, uh, your family situation.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.209
Yeah.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.499
No, I'm good.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.964
I'm good. This is exactly what I want.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.594
Great. Right.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.051
Thanks, actually.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.385
Yeah.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.306
Okay, here's what we do.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.521
We--we run a full background check,
and we see if anybody knows anything.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.027
Look, the longer we wait,
somebody's gonna hear Gabe got busted.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.692
Okay, fine. Fine.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.579
But let me tell you something.
These guys are not street punks, okay?

11:47.624 --> 11:48.704
You got to watch yourself here.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.036
(beeping, police radio chatter)

11:51.085 --> 11:53.212
Radio.
(click, silence)

11:55.882 --> 11:58.214
Yeah, hi. This is Gabe from Montreal.
Is this Angel?

11:58.760 --> 12:01.593
Cool, okay. Uh, Angel, you listening?
The deal's off.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.969
(cell phone disconnect beep)

12:05.058 --> 12:06.047
What did you do?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.140
(cell phone rings)

12:12.857 --> 12:14.597
- Wait, just--
(ring, beep)

12:15.777 --> 12:16.937
Hello?

12:17.946 --> 12:18.981
Yeah. What?

12:19.781 --> 12:20.770
What's my problem?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.652
I come into town
a couple of days early, right?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.487
(sniffs)
There's talk everywhere.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.535
Junkies on the street know my name.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.821
I'm hearing rumors I got busted, okay?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.250
What the hell is going on, Angel?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.826
- Why'd I come early?
- (whispers) Edie.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.995
To see my girlfriend,
but that's beside the point.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.379
This is not gonna work, man.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.749
Well, I appreciate that,

12:41.803 --> 12:43.088
but you know what's gonna
make me feel better

12:43.137 --> 12:45.048
is we do this deal tonight,
because I'm going home,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.588
and you're gonna have
to explain to Mr. Bergen

12:46.641 --> 12:48.973
why he's out $2 million
and a brand-new business partner.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.939
Mermaid Lounge is fine.
(chuckles)

12:56.276 --> 12:57.265
All right.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.567
Thank you. (beep)

13:00.822 --> 13:03.438
- Loved it.
- (exhales deeply)

13:04.909 --> 13:07.651
Okay, I'm Gabe.
I meet Angel and Bergen,

13:08.079 --> 13:09.444
make the buy,
walk out of the place.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.782
You go in and bust 'em both.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.914
Bergen I know about.
What about this Angel?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.665
His real name's Simon Torrance.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.123
He's a mellow guy.
Been with Bergen since forever.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.253
- So we can't risk a wire?
- They'll find it.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.790
Okay, well, you know what?
I don't want Sammy going in there alone.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.208
So he needs backup.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.502
They're only expecting one guy, right?
Gabe.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.177
Well, what about Edie?

13:28.016 --> 13:30.803
I mean, Gabe said that he was here
to see his girlfriend.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.059
So maybe he brings her
with him to the buy.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.137
- Mm?
- Yeah, okay.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.602
Um, I'll see if I can dig somebody up
from undercover.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.891
There's really not a lot of time, though.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.933
Yeah, well, I'll do it.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.318
No, thank you.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.402
Uh, appreciate the gesture, McNally,
but we need someone with more experience.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.316
l have experience.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.325
I'm sorry. Are you referring
to the hooker detail?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.986
Because you couldn't give it away.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.907
What exactly do l have to do--
be his girlfriend?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.824
I think I can manage that.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.618
You do all the talking.
I'm just gonna back you up.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.253
I mean, unless you guys
have a better idea.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.506
McNally and I spent
the last six months riding together.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.836
We do know each other's moves.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.251
It's not like we got a lot of time here.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.586
Sammy's call.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.133
You think she can do this?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.222
I do.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.266
You're doing it.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.483
Oh, hey, good luck.
You're gonna need it.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.109
Thank you.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.614
So that drive-by took 12 minutes,
which means 48 minutes till our next report.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.405
What about the 30 seconds
it's gonna take to call in the report?

14:35.458 --> 14:38.040
- Did you factor that into your calculations?
- What? No.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.994
What, do you think this is funny?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.789
What's funny is you taking
this assignment so seriously.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.460
It's nothing but mindless procedure,
and it's--it's pretty lame.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.595
- We're on surveillance.
- Of an empty building.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.101
It's not even a real target.
It's just a satellite location,

14:54.143 --> 14:55.303
which means it doesn't matter.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.139
Yeah, but--but Bergen owns the building.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.224
Bergen owns a bunch of buildings.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.355
We got this one 'cause we're rookies.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.149
All right, fine.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.810
Pull in over there.
Let's do a walk-around.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.399
We weren't told to do a walk-around.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.484
You always do what you're told?

15:09.534 --> 15:11.399
Hmm? You want to be
a rookie forever?

15:13.121 --> 15:14.611
Fine. Let's do a walk-around.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.212
I'll check upstairs. You check down.
We'll meet up in five?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.261
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.007
Hey.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.508
What do you think?

16:20.813 --> 16:21.973
I hate to say it, McNally,

16:22.023 --> 16:24.139
but you don't exactly scream
"cheap thrills."

16:24.192 --> 16:25.477
We got some work to do.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.142
What are you talking about?
I can be way cheap.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.986
(chuckles) Okay.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.573
All right. So...
how long you been dancing?

16:34.619 --> 16:37.656
Couple years.
You know, pays the bills.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.820
And what's our story?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.614
You pay the bills, too.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.245
Come on. We're selling ourselves
as a hot and heavy couple here.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.751
We have major history, okay?
How'd we meet?

16:46.422 --> 16:47.832
Uh, at a club,

16:47.882 --> 16:50.294
and I thought you were pretty cool.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.085
How did I make you feel?
Did you like me right away?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.377
Or did it take a while?

16:54.430 --> 16:55.886
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.343
Okay, I guess.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.929
- |--| don't know.
- Somebody asks you a question,

17:00.978 --> 17:03.264
you can't be thinking about it, McNally.
You gotta know.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.975
Do you understand
what we're getting into here?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.769
Absolutely.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.309
All right.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.687
(telephone ringing)

17:12.740 --> 17:13.946
Hey, Nash,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.736
Officer Epstein here is gonna be with you
for the rest of the day.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.866
He's auditing.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.568
Auditing?

17:20.081 --> 17:21.867
Did he just make you my supervisor
or something?

17:21.916 --> 17:23.952
More like he made you my babysitter,

17:24.001 --> 17:25.787
which is crazy,
'cause I didn't do anything wrong.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.747
Yeah, I know. We all know.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.129
They think Edie is mixed up
with this drug dealer.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.675
When they realize she's not,
everything's gonna be fine.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.129
Well, in the meantime,
you want to help me input?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.463
Not allowed to use computers.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.597
Oh. Okay.
How about making some calls?

17:39.642 --> 17:40.848
Or the phone.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.647
Are you allowed to make coffee?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.392
(tapping)

17:51.445 --> 17:52.571
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.602
That's a good look.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.026
Want to go check out
a new house together?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.908
Oh, cute. (chuckles)
You wanted to see me?

17:58.953 --> 18:01.490
Yeah, Jerry asked me to pull what we have
on Bergen for background.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.242
He's still a suspect in a triple homicide
we're investigating--

18:04.292 --> 18:07.910
one of his competitors,
his wife and their 3-year-old.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.702
You can't make the charges stick?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.620
He keeps killing the witnesses.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.210
Oh.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.215
So are you, uh, you sure about this?

18:15.886 --> 18:16.966
Sure about what?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.502
The undercover.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.972
I know you. You're Andy McNally.
You think you screwed up,

18:22.018 --> 18:23.974
so you're running around trying to fix it,
and you don't have to.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.395
Luke, I'm a cop. This is myjob.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.805
And I don't want you to get hurt.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.901
(sighs) Okay. All this time,
we've--we've been fine,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.403
and we're gonna move in together.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.031
And now all of a sudden
you're worried about me?

18:39.076 --> 18:41.283
This is bigger than anything
you've ever done before.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.990
You don't think I can do this?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.453
You know, if this is how it's gonna be
when we live together,

18:48.502 --> 18:50.288
maybe I shouldn't have said yes.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.670
This has nothing to do
with living together.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.972
Okay, so I guess there is nothing.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.634
Yeah. I've been watching this building
with Dov for about a week,

19:06.687 --> 19:07.893
and there's been nothing.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.146
So let's just file another report on nothing
and then get something to eat.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.434
Yeah, but the door was open.
I mean, we could report that.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.602
(scoffs) We better get out of here.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.656
(crash, clatter)

19:20.701 --> 19:21.941
Hey!

19:32.046 --> 19:34.082
Uhh! Aah.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.917
Hey! Police! Don't move!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.126
Don't move!

19:38.719 --> 19:39.754
Chris!

19:39.804 --> 19:43.012
- Chris?
- (groaning)

19:43.057 --> 19:44.388
Hey. Are you okay?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.889
Yeah. The guy knocked the wind out of me.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.141
(door creaks, slams)

19:50.648 --> 19:51.808
Hey.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.770
Come on! Come on!

19:57.571 --> 19:59.983
-ltslocked.
- (Chris gasping)

20:00.449 --> 20:01.564
What?

20:05.496 --> 20:06.485
l'm--l'm bleeding.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.497
Oh! (grunts)

20:11.460 --> 20:12.996
He--he stabbed me.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.252
(gaSDS)

20:16.716 --> 20:18.707
Okay, try again. Come on.
(static crackles)

20:18.759 --> 20:20.715
Mark, 1519.
Dispatch, come in.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.719
Great. No radio,
no cell phone reception.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.005
You gotta move your arm. Come on.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.047
Okay.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.763
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.929
Come on, up, up, up. It's okay.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.722
(gaSDS)

20:34.775 --> 20:37.687
Okay. How do you feel?
Do you feel cold, faint, nauseous?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.693
Stupid. | feel stupid.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.728
I didn't even see the knife.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.022
It's okay.
(fabric rips)

20:43.075 --> 20:44.736
- Okay, I want you to hold that, okay?
- (grunts) Okay.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.025
- Can you apply pressure?
- Yeah.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.944
It's okay.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.160
Fire in the hole.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.080
Gail, what are you doing?

20:55.129 --> 20:57.120
Come on! (grunts)

20:57.173 --> 20:59.585
Come on!

21:00.217 --> 21:01.206
This sucks.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.921
I've been sitting in a car

21:02.970 --> 21:04.631
staring at an empty building
for over a week now,

21:04.680 --> 21:06.090
waiting for this bust.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.017
It's finally here, and I'm sitting
on the fricking sidelines.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.721
Well, maybe you can make yourself useful.
Those need filing.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.851
Oh, yeah?
What are you working on?

21:13.856 --> 21:14.971
Edie's phone records,

21:15.024 --> 21:17.015
and your number's in here a lot.
Do you ever sleep?

21:17.067 --> 21:18.853
Hey, it's private.

21:18.903 --> 21:19.892
- Let me see.
- No.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.519
What am I gonna do, swallow it?

21:21.572 --> 21:22.982
I don't think you're allowed to...

21:26.160 --> 21:27.491
Whose number is this?

21:28.120 --> 21:31.078
It belongs to the guy they arrested--
Gabe Lessing.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.412
(door beeps)
Epstein, you shouldn't be in here.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.794
This'll just take a moment, sir.
I have some information.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.828
(Oliver sighs)

21:39.882 --> 21:42.749
Edith Larson has been in regular
phone contact with Gabe Lessing

21:42.802 --> 21:44.417
- two or three times a week...
- Dov, I can explain!

21:44.470 --> 21:45.960
- Despite the fact that she claims...
- It's not what you think!

21:46.013 --> 21:47.219
that her relationship with Mr. Lessing...

21:47.264 --> 21:48.595
- ended eight months ago!
- Hang on, Epstein!

21:48.641 --> 21:51.599
It did! Dov, why are you doing this?

21:51.644 --> 21:54.602
Because I'm a cop,
and you've been lying to me.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.262
You've been lying to me
from the beginning. It's all right there.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.647
Look again. All the calls are incoming.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.730
He's been phoning me
ever since we broke up,

22:02.696 --> 22:04.436
always wants to get back together.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.900
(rumples paper)

22:05.950 --> 22:06.985
How did I miss this?

22:08.536 --> 22:09.776
What was he doing at your house today?

22:09.829 --> 22:13.321
I don't know. He had some big job
he wanted to brag about.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.831
That's just Gabe--
always trying to impress me.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.117
Yeah. Her story checks out.
She's in the clear.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.293
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.708
I guess I was afraid how you'd react.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.385
Okay. Officers Swarek and McNally,
posing as buyers,

22:31.433 --> 22:34.300
will meet Henry Bergen
and Angel Torrance

22:34.353 --> 22:37.186
at the Mermaid Lounge,
which Bergen owns.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.023
We have Officer Williams and Detective Callaghan
heading up the cover team.

22:41.068 --> 22:45.232
From this point forward, no cell phone calls,
no texts, no e-mails.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.614
Nobody contacts anyone not on their team.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.196
We got one chance to do this,
one chance only.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.904
So let's do it. Let's go.
(claps hands)

23:10.973 --> 23:12.383
You okay?

23:12.433 --> 23:13.889
Mm-hmm.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.969
- Really burns you, doesn't it?
- Excuse me?

23:18.772 --> 23:21.184
Callaghan wanting to protect you,
look out for you.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.519
No, I think it's really sweet, actually.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.525
It pisses you off.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.062
You're not some little girl
who needs her hand held.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.106
You busted me your first day on the job.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.150
Wow. You're really never gonna
let that go, are you?

23:32.202 --> 23:35.194
Why would I? You took me down.
And I'm awesome!

23:35.998 --> 23:37.613
Which, of course,
means you are awesome.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.370
Well, how come you believe that
and he doesn't?

23:40.419 --> 23:43.206
'Cause I'm your partner, McNally,
and Callaghan's your, you know,

23:43.255 --> 23:44.495
colleague with benefits.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.338
| work with you. He doesn't.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.998
Yeah, well, he should back me up
no matter what.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.589
And what exactly is he doing here
on our cover team?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.094
He doesn't need to be here,

23:52.139 --> 23:54.380
but he is... for you.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.728
We have takedown target
and satellite locations.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.607
Here we got a log of reports
of each unit.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.394
Every unit we need to
make sure is accounted for,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.686
every hour on the hour.

24:08.739 --> 24:09.899
Got it.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.867
I know it's not the most exciting job.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.277
That's true.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.742
lt'sjust... I know you,

24:18.791 --> 24:22.249
and I thought you might want
to feel closer to the action.

24:22.962 --> 24:23.951
Thank you.

24:24.672 --> 24:25.661
Yeah.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.414
(telephone ringing)

24:32.846 --> 24:33.881
(Dov) Hey.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.512
Hey.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.178
So at least now you know why
the bad guys are scared of you.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.342
(both laugh nervously)

24:40.229 --> 24:41.765
I'm sorry.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.599
I'm so sorry.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.139
I'm not mad.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.932
- You're not?
- No.

24:47.528 --> 24:48.938
Oh. Great.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.353
You were doing your job.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.031
We both knew this was never gonna last.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.526
W-what?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.411
No, no, no, no.
| didn't--| didn't know that.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.367
I'm a stripper.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.040
How is that ever gonna fit in your life?

25:04.086 --> 25:07.249
- Doesn't matter to me.
- It's why you didn't trust me.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.958
I trust you. I do.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.465
I promise you I've learned my lesson.
I trust you now.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.216
(Oliver) Epstein.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.817
She seemed really nice.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.609
Yeah, ljust--
I never should have suspected her.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.068
No, it's not about that.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.282
Yeah, here, really, it's about this.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.457
You know, none of these people are, uh,

25:42.499 --> 25:46.833
going home at a regular time tonight
or--or any night, for that matter.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.873
Yeah, nobody's sitting around
with their families

25:48.922 --> 25:52.085
having, um, you know, cozy little dinners
with their loved ones,

25:52.134 --> 25:53.340
talking about what they did at work today.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.625
You have a family.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.464
I'm a very special person,

25:58.098 --> 26:01.716
and l, uh, made a lot of mistakes...

26:02.227 --> 26:04.388
and I got hurt and hurt some people

26:04.438 --> 26:07.805
before I finally found someone
who could stand the life.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.895
You mean you finally found
someone who could stand you?

26:10.944 --> 26:13.777
(laughs)
Yeah, you said it, brother.

26:14.198 --> 26:18.066
Anyway, Dov, look,
uh, you got a family.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.200
You just--
yeah, look around.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.781
(slaps arm)

26:27.669 --> 26:29.205
(turns engine off)

26:33.008 --> 26:34.623
(lowered voice)
Alpha one, we're in position.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.005
Come on.
I want to hear you say it.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.336
Say what?

26:39.389 --> 26:41.050
That you're scared,
that you don't think you can do it.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.512
Whatever it is-- come on.
Get it out. Now.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.770
I'm tired...

26:48.816 --> 26:51.478
of feeling like I'm never ready--

26:51.527 --> 26:54.394
I mean, really ready for anything.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.241
I'm constantly faking.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.656
McNally, listen to me.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.829
I've been with you since you started,

27:05.874 --> 27:06.954
and I've seen how far you've come.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.989
And I'm telling you right now,

27:08.043 --> 27:10.750
there's nobody I'd rather go
through that door with--nobody.

27:11.213 --> 27:14.205
So if you can't trust yourself on that,
you trust me.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.173
'Cause you're ready.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.043
- Okay.
- Okay?

27:21.014 --> 27:23.596
(sighs) l'm terrified.

27:24.852 --> 27:25.841
Of course you are.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.304
That's what makes it fun.

27:28.021 --> 27:31.013
(siren wailing in distance)

27:38.073 --> 27:39.938
(laughs)

27:41.410 --> 27:44.902
(Angel) Just a sad commentary
that we even have to bring these things, huh?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.871
But, uh, Angel, would we respect
each other if we didn't?

27:47.916 --> 27:49.372
(laughs)

27:49.418 --> 27:51.454
Mmm. (kisses)

27:52.963 --> 27:53.952
Go on, Rick.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.009
I'm sorry, but I do have to check.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.980
That's a beautiful outfit,
and you wear it well.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.610
Gabe's a lucky guy.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.067
Oh, I'm a lucky guy. (laughs)

28:23.285 --> 28:24.741
Edie, you look familiar.

28:25.913 --> 28:26.902
Where would I know you from?

28:27.623 --> 28:30.285
Well, | work over at Tassie's.
I'm a dancer.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.449
(scoffs)

28:33.962 --> 28:35.338
I haven't had the pleasure.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.496
And that's where
you mixed up with Gabe here?

28:37.549 --> 28:40.131
Well, yeah. I mean,
I started dancing a couple years ago.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.917
And Gabe came in, you know,
Mr. Big Shot.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.586
Just finished some big deal
or something.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.596
- You know how guys are.
- Oh, I do.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.099
Yeah? Anyway, um...

28:49.937 --> 28:52.349
Everyone told me
to just watch out for him.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.388
You know, he's trouble.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.476
But what can you do?

28:55.525 --> 28:57.231
I mean, when you meet
the right one, that's it.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.726
You just get that feeling, right?

29:02.115 --> 29:03.446
Yeah, I guess with some people...

29:05.202 --> 29:06.282
you just know.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.659
(whispers) Yeah.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.163
All right then, let's get this done.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.460
Well, Angel, | see you.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.120
| see Ricky.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.292
But I don't see Henry Bergen.

29:20.342 --> 29:23.175
Yeah, well, like you said on the phone...
(unzips bag)

29:23.220 --> 29:24.835
(sniffs) There's been a change of plans.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.633
(metal clatters)

29:38.277 --> 29:39.767
Chris, just hang on.
We're almost there.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.355
I'm gonna be okay.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.191
(metal creaking)

29:44.992 --> 29:46.573
(clang)

29:49.454 --> 29:50.955
(man) How's it going?
What--what's that?

29:52.207 --> 29:54.493
How you doin'?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.325
(lowers voice) It's Bergen.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.710
- What?
- He's here.

30:04.261 --> 30:07.094
But--but this wasn't--
wasn't supposed to be the place.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.174
No, I know.

30:11.018 --> 30:14.636
Look, | can--| can climb
through that window.

30:14.688 --> 30:15.768
And get shot?

30:16.857 --> 30:17.846
- Chris--
- No.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.814
Chris, you need help, okay?

30:20.360 --> 30:22.021
You're losing way too much blood.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.528
(breathing heavily)

30:31.955 --> 30:33.161
I shouldn't have got us into this.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.288
You didn't, okay?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.244
We got into this as partners.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.754
(sniffles)

30:47.012 --> 30:48.468
I miss you.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.430
(sniffles, voice breaking)
You're gonna be okay.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.562
We're both gonna be okay.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.486
It's all there, so, uh,
where's my stuff?

31:07.074 --> 31:08.234
Oh, it's not here.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.272
Not here?

31:09.326 --> 31:10.441
Mm-mmm.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.030
First Bergen doesn't show.

31:12.079 --> 31:15.071
Then, uh, you don't even
bring my product?

31:15.832 --> 31:16.821
(sniffles)

31:17.501 --> 31:19.082
(siren wailing in distance)

31:19.419 --> 31:20.534
It's all good.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.338
I'll take the money and be back in 20
with the narcotics.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.749
No, no, no, no. Forget it.

31:27.511 --> 31:28.500
We're outta here.

31:30.639 --> 31:34.632
Okay. I guess the Landrys are fine
with you blowing a $2 million deal.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.673
They must really like you.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.592
What they like is their money,
and what they won't like

31:37.646 --> 31:39.887
is me letting it walk out the door
with some guy I never met,

31:39.940 --> 31:41.476
and I got nothing in my hands.
(zips bag)

31:41.817 --> 31:43.307
Okay, how about this?

31:44.403 --> 31:45.392
Money stays here.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.777
Gabe watches over it. With him.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.565
You take me to the dope, okay?

31:50.617 --> 31:52.357
Deal's good, I call Gabe,

31:52.411 --> 31:54.868
and he lets Rick take the money.
Done.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.487
Smangm.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.790
She has her moments.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.121
Well, as pretty as she is,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.502
I think I'd rather have
you come with me.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.084
Yeah, I think so, too.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.878
(whispers) Okay, look.
This was my idea.

32:12.931 --> 32:13.920
You don't have to do this.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.553
(whispers) Yeah, well, Callaghan's
not the only one who's got your back.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.563
You sure about this?
Yeah. Deal's not done.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.102
Okay.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.477
(Andy, normal voice) Hey, Angel...

32:31.491 --> 32:33.607
look, this is my man.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.530
I'm not letting him walk out of here
without his gun.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.992
Now that's a girl you can count on.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.921
(clicks teeth)

32:52.596 --> 32:55.178
(door creaks,
horn honks in distance)

33:02.731 --> 33:03.846
Was that a sign?

33:04.941 --> 33:06.147
(car engine starts)
Yeah.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.603
"The deal is still in play."

33:07.652 --> 33:09.813
Okay, where the hell are they going?

33:09.863 --> 33:11.979
- Where's McNally?
- (Noelle) I don't know.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.907
Alpha 2, Alpha 6,
you need to follow the red sedan.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.283
Keep your distance.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.698
Okay, we need to go in now.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.160
No, no. We have no sign.
We got no deal.

33:22.209 --> 33:24.791
(Noelle) What? What, so we just leave
McNally in there with no backup?

33:27.047 --> 33:28.127
Luke?

33:30.425 --> 33:32.381
McNally knows what she's doing.
We gotta trust that.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.002
Okay. Till the deal gets done,
we sit tight.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.592
(men speaking indistinctly)

33:43.188 --> 33:45.179
(Gail sobbing quietly)

33:54.324 --> 33:56.315
(telephone ringing)

33:56.368 --> 33:58.199
Being a cop sucks.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.611
Only thing worse is
not getting to be one.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.452
We haven't heard from Chris or Gail
in over an hour.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.243
(Dov) They still doing surveillance
from the satellite location?

34:08.296 --> 34:10.207
Yeah, and they're supposed
to be doing hourly call-ins.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.123
Chris, not following a rule?

34:17.681 --> 34:18.670
(Traci) Detective Barber?

34:18.723 --> 34:21.715
We got a problem.
Swarek just left the primary location

34:21.768 --> 34:23.679
without the dope or McNally.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.391
We got a tail on him
but no idea where he's going,

34:27.440 --> 34:30.477
and there's no way that I can
get my team in place in time.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.937
Well, which way are they headed?

34:32.654 --> 34:34.736
- North.
- That's Bergen's building.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.112
It's the place
l was watching with Gail.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.990
Chris and Gail are there now,
and they haven't reported in over an hour.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.411
So this is Bergen's building.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.444
Okay, I'm calling ETF.
Let's get it going.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.783
(Oliver) I need all available personnel
in full gear!

34:46.501 --> 34:49.163
Epstein, you waiting
for an invite in the mail?

34:49.212 --> 34:50.292
Come on, suit up. Let's go.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.794
Yes, sir!

34:53.842 --> 34:54.877
(Jerry) Traci.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.467
He said all available personnel.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.846
You know, if you're gonna do stuff
to make other people happy,

35:03.184 --> 35:05.140
it's kind of hard
if you're not happy yourself.

35:14.821 --> 35:15.981
Lot of money, huh?

35:22.329 --> 35:24.911
So, uh, any idea
where they're going--

35:24.956 --> 35:26.912
I mean, how close this place is?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.664
Whatever. It's close enough.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.996
Mm. So, like, a couple of blocks?

35:31.046 --> 35:33.503
Sure, yeah. A couple blocks.

35:33.923 --> 35:34.958
Okay.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.883
Gabe doesn't tell me much either.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.054
What?

35:41.348 --> 35:43.339
I'm just saying, you know,

35:43.391 --> 35:45.382
seems like we're both
kind of in the dark here.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.550
Yeah, well, I'm not.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.810
Okay.

35:51.608 --> 35:52.688
You don't look very old.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.693
Yeah. I'm assuming this is
probably one of your first big jobs.

35:58.531 --> 36:02.194
So it doesn't really make sense
to tell much to a kid.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.235
Hey! They tell me plenty, all right?

36:05.288 --> 36:07.279
Oh, of course they do, honey. Yeah.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.744
- (Ricky sighs)
- (Andy) It's fine.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.205
That's why Gabe and Angel
are taking care of everything.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.585
(scoffs) Oh, you really think
your boyfriend's all that?

36:15.715 --> 36:18.673
Well, Landry did give him $2 million.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.549
Yeah, and he screwed up the deal.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.428
That's why Landry had to fly into town
to smooth things over.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.717
- Landry's in town?
- Yeah.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.723
I picked him up at the airport myself.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.058
Oh. I guess you don't know
everything either.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.398
Yeah. I gotta go.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.274
Go? That wasn't the deal.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.811
- I'm going.
- Hey! (cocks gun)

36:41.116 --> 36:43.402
Look, don't make me shoot you, okay?

36:43.451 --> 36:44.566
I don't want to, but I will.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.859
Let me tell you somethin', Rick.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.404
Right now you're in the middle
of the worst day of your life.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.833
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're scared.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.456
- No.
- Yeah, 'cause you don't want to let down

36:52.502 --> 36:53.867
all those people who are counting on you.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.666
Well, the best thing you can hope for
right now is to get out of here alive,

36:57.716 --> 37:00.332
which you will not do if you
keep pointing that gun at a cop.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.876
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.761
Right now they're taking my partner
to a place where they're gonna kill him

37:05.807 --> 37:07.672
the second they see he is not Gabe.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.091
So I'm gonna walk out that front door,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.509
and I'm gonna try to save him.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.268
And if you shoot me,

37:12.939 --> 37:14.270
a bunch of other cops
are gonna come in here

37:14.315 --> 37:16.055
and do a whole lot worse to you,
okay?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.145
Your only other option
is let me walk out.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.231
- I'll go tojail.
- Yeah, probably.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.941
But you know what?
You'll be alive in jail.

37:21.990 --> 37:22.979
l can't--l can't do that.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.863
Shoot me or let me walk out!

37:25.535 --> 37:28.652
Because you might be new at this,
but this is not my first day.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.287
Don't you walk away.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.540
I'm not kidding. Stop.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.713
Turn around. Come on. Stop.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.294
Stop!

38:14.292 --> 38:15.873
You gotta stop Sam's car!

38:16.503 --> 38:18.915
As soon as he gets to Bergen, he's made!
They're gonna kill him!

38:18.963 --> 38:22.126
Alpha 2, Alpha 6, 10-33--
officer in jeopardy! Move it. Now!

38:22.175 --> 38:25.258
(sirens wailing)

38:29.390 --> 38:33.099
(police radio chatter,
guns cocking)

38:39.317 --> 38:40.477
(door bangs open,
(officers) Police!

38:40.527 --> 38:43.985
(officers) Police!
Drop your weapons! Drop down!

38:45.490 --> 38:46.821
We're good.
We're getting out of here.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.822
(officers and men shouting)

38:48.868 --> 38:50.404
(gunfire)

38:54.999 --> 38:56.955
(man on radio) Shots fired! Shots fired!

38:57.001 --> 38:59.708
This is Alpha 1. There's an undercover cop
in the building.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.537
I repeat, an undercover cop in the building.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.669
(man on radio) Dispatch,
l have one victim--GSV, shot in the chest.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.333
Have responding units seal the building.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.347
(police radio chatter)

39:12.392 --> 39:15.350
(sirens wailing)

39:26.364 --> 39:30.152
(man) J‘ I've been walking .l‘

39:30.201 --> 39:34.570
.l‘ Down by the river .l‘

39:44.465 --> 39:46.717
.l‘ She could .l‘

39:46.759 --> 39:48.670
We need a medic upstairs now.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.926
Officer down.

39:53.308 --> 39:59.269
.l‘ River did you know? .l‘

40:06.404 --> 40:07.439
(Sam) McNally.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.066
(Andy) Hey.

40:11.701 --> 40:12.816
You're okay.

40:13.119 --> 40:16.782
(chuckles) Yeah. Thanks to you.
You were great in there.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.038
Thanks.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.916
See? You don't have
to fake it anymore.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.703
(chuckles)

40:24.756 --> 40:27.372
(helicopter hovering)

40:30.803 --> 40:34.216
Well, you should, uh,
get in there and give a statement.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.510
- All right.
- See you tomorrow...

40:37.018 --> 40:38.098
copper?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.555
See you tomorrow.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.315
He's okay.
You had his back.

40:51.324 --> 40:52.313
Yeah.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.816
Thank you for having mine.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.951
So, um...

41:02.001 --> 41:03.116
when do we get our keys?

41:04.003 --> 41:05.834
(both chuckle)

41:08.341 --> 41:13.631
(man) J‘ Walkin' with you
in these windswept fields .l‘

41:13.846 --> 41:16.178
You should get over there,
be part of the action.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.510
No. I want to be with you.

41:21.187 --> 41:26.682
J‘ But though these moments
.l‘ reach from our fingers at night .l‘

41:27.610 --> 41:33.446

J‘ For surely I know .l‘

41:36.077 --> 41:37.317
Okay.

Okay. That's great.

Bye.
(beep)

41:40.707 --> 41:43.414
.l‘ The night belongs... .l‘

41:43.459 --> 41:45.120
| just got off the phone with Gail.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.084
Chris is gonna be all right.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.080
He lost a lot of blood, but it's okay.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.213
- Good.
- That's good.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.003
Hey, you guys saved his life today.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.126
Hey, you saved Swarek's ass.

41:55.722 --> 41:56.802
Well...

41:58.266 --> 42:01.929
Biggest drug bust in 15's history,
and we were a part of it.

42:01.978 --> 42:04.720
(Traci laughs) We're coppers.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.273
(Andy) Yeah!

42:06.899 --> 42:09.356
(Dov) You know, we really earned our way
into the platoon today.

42:10.403 --> 42:11.609
(Andy) Damn straight we did.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.983
(Oliver) Hey, rookies,
get the hell off the car.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.988
Anyway, it was fun.
(clears throat)
