19:29.369 --> 19:31.435
since that winter I was on
"Deadliest Catch."

19:32.804 --> 19:34.539
Well...

19:34.541 --> 19:38.309
I've got a waste can
of baby faces I'm not gonna use.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.378
Yeah.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.881
Turns out, we're not
gonna design our baby anymore.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.317
But what about wanting it
to have a delicate chin?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.352
And a thigh gap?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.390
You know, girls,
I realized

19:52.392 --> 19:55.026
I just want to have
a healthy, happy baby.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.962
You know, it's like
my Aunt Ruffa said

19:57.964 --> 20:01.232
after she lost her tongue,
you know...

20:01.234 --> 20:07.238
"Dou det what dou det,
and dou don't det updet."

20:09.575 --> 20:12.009
You know, which roughly
translates to,

20:12.011 --> 20:16.747
"You get what you get,
and you don't get upset."

20:18.317 --> 20:20.718
That's a really mature decision.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.521
The doctor wanted 60 grand.

20:23.523 --> 20:27.525
Yeah,
that affected our decision too.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.427
Well, maybe letting things
happen naturally

20:29.429 --> 20:30.695
is the way to go.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.663
Because sometimes
when you force things,

20:32.665 --> 20:35.266
you put $130 million worth
of basketball players

20:35.268 --> 20:36.867
on the disabled list.
