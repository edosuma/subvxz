WEBVTT

00:20.021 --> 00:23.399
'The Cali cartel is
an almost-perfect organism.

00:24.817 --> 00:28.863
'Even though we had cut off its head,
the body kept right on going,

00:28.988 --> 00:31.574
'making and selling cocaine.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.576
'They stuck to the plan.

00:33.701 --> 00:37.329
'And for a long time,
that plan had worked for them.'

00:37.455 --> 00:41.125
The guy's innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

00:41.250 --> 00:45.629
Easy, honey, easy, okay?
Be careful.

00:45.755 --> 00:49.842
- The glove.
- Screw the fucking glove, brother!

00:49.967 --> 00:53.846
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.432
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

00:56.557 --> 01:01.645
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

01:01.771 --> 01:04.065
'But no plan is perfect.

01:04.190 --> 01:08.277
'Especially when you deal
with a substance as volatile as cocaine.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.198
'At some point,
you're gonna make a mistake.

01:12.323 --> 01:16.577
'And your enemies
are watching and waiting.

01:16.702 --> 01:20.623
'They're gonna see your weakness
and make a move.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.292
'See, that's the thing about plans.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.295
'No matter how perfect
you think they are,

01:26.420 --> 01:30.424
'however brilliant or audacious
they may be,

01:30.549 --> 01:33.803
'well, they can still go to shit
when that one thing goes wrong.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.196
'And once that happens,
there's no going back.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.491
'It's all downhill from there.'

03:56.570 --> 03:57.905
Oh, hey, hey.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.409
Think that's him?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.746
Has to be.

04:43.409 --> 04:44.743
Let's go.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.142
Close enough.
Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.779
- I'm unarmed.
- Approach slowly, hands out.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.616
- You told nobody about this?
- Nobody.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.786
- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.539
You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.208
And then straight on to Rozo.

05:36.128 --> 05:40.215
I had to make sure you are
who you say you are. That you're alone.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.635
Get in the car.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.347
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.234
I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

05:59.360 --> 06:04.281
- Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.
- What about yours?

06:04.406 --> 06:06.325
I don't want to be sitting here
more than two minutes.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.952
This is the only time we're gonna
speak to each other face-to-face.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.205
So you said you work
for the Rodríguez brothers.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.791
I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.336
- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.171
I have valuable information for you.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.967
In exchange, I want safe passage
for my family and myself to the States.

06:24.093 --> 06:27.096
Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.307
Listen, here's the thing, man.
You're head of security for the cartel.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.393
You have a lot more to offer us
than just testimony.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.019
Like Miguel Rodríguez.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.524
Is that gonna be a problem?

06:38.649 --> 06:40.776
Besides the fact that
we're all gonna end up dead?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.611
There's a security system
that I designed.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.197
Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

06:45.322 --> 06:47.074
a radio communication system.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.867
- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.662
Then there's David, Miguel's son.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.790
He personally controls
his father's security now.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.709
- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.422
And if I do?
The police? The military?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.257
You can't trust them. I pay them.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.427
We can get guys we trust, all right?
Don't worry about it.

07:06.552 --> 07:12.182
Don't worry about it?
No. I'll testify. That's it.

07:12.891 --> 07:17.104
Let me ask you something.
Why are you doing this? Talking to us?

07:17.229 --> 07:21.733
I'm not a murderer. I'm not like them.
I want to get my family out.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.194
Well, we'd love to help you
with that, but...

07:25.279 --> 07:27.239
...we can't do that
unless you give us Miguel.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.658
And honestly,
we don't need your testimony.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.870
Bottom line, you have a better option,
you're free to take it.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.044
I need to think about this.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.799
Still didn't catch your name.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.014
Jorge. Salcedo.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.784
I think we found a gold mine.

08:12.910 --> 08:16.663
Guy says he's head of security
for the cartel and he wants to roll?

08:16.788 --> 08:19.833
They don't call it the Cali KGB
for nothing, Chris.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.087
Let's get the fuck out of here.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.719
Franklin Jurado....

08:30.844 --> 08:33.931
One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.807
He travels on multiple passports.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.769
So, he gets on a flight, we lose him
who-the-fuck-knows-where.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.688
I need him on a plane today
so that he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.732
Okay, guys, listen up.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.944
We will provide Agent Peña
and his men with any support they require.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.195
Understood?

08:48.320 --> 08:51.156
Okay, typically,
he goes to a cooperative credit bank

08:51.281 --> 08:52.574
and then has breakfast.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.661
- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey...

08:57.412 --> 09:00.958
- You plan to take him at the bank?
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.460
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.004
'So here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.881
'It's a smuggler's paradise.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.884
'And for the Cali cartel,
you can't beat the location.

09:11.009 --> 09:15.013
'Only 40 miles separates
South American coast from Curaçaon ports,

09:15.138 --> 09:19.685
'prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.772
'Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.943
'And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.028
'Way back,
some enterprising Dutchmen

09:30.153 --> 09:33.448
'set up a financial system
cloaked in old-world secrecy.

09:33.574 --> 09:37.119
'Their economy is so dependent
on money launderers parking their cash,

09:37.244 --> 09:41.290
'that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.

09:41.415 --> 09:45.711
'Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?'

09:47.337 --> 09:50.841
All right, we tail him. Then we catch him
somewhere that suits us both.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.051
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.304
Okay, let's go.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.567
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

10:08.692 --> 10:13.488
As many of you know, since Córdova's
resignation, I am the head of security.

10:16.617 --> 10:21.121
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

10:21.246 --> 10:26.460
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

10:26.918 --> 10:32.090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

10:33.383 --> 10:38.388
Let's make them feel welcome.
And help them any way you can.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.436
That's all, boys. Get going!

10:47.981 --> 10:52.819
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.780
You're a natural.

10:56.239 --> 11:01.161
Look, David, if we're going
to work together, we need to cooperate.

11:01.995 --> 11:07.417
If you have questions or you want
to talk about your father's security,

11:07.542 --> 11:09.252
I'm here.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.922
Thank you.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.466
I do have a question, Jorge.

11:14.591 --> 11:18.053
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns? Huh?

11:19.096 --> 11:22.933
Because we use our radios
if we have a problem.

11:23.058 --> 11:27.604
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

11:28.397 --> 11:29.898
Do me a favour, Jorge.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.860
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.707
Boss, you didn't mention
the DEA agents that are in Cali.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.251
That's something David
might be interested in.

11:49.376 --> 11:53.880
Last thing we need right now is David
and his crew killing a federal agent.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.717
Well, that's true.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.137
For now,
we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.857
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.654
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

12:17.779 --> 12:22.242
I know you don't want
to leave New York. I know.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.287
I don't either.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.250
But if they connect this lab to us,

12:30.375 --> 12:33.670
we're going to have
every cop in the city after us.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.549
Hey, look. Here it comes.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.428
'Spokesmen for the DEA say that
the cocaine lab that exploded in Queens

12:41.553 --> 12:43.597
'was operated by a Dominican gang.'

12:43.722 --> 12:47.851
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

12:47.976 --> 12:52.230
'But Manuel de Dios, editor of "La Prensa"
has discovered another side to the story.'

12:52.355 --> 12:54.858
'This lab, along with a number
of others in the area,

12:54.983 --> 12:58.612
'was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,

12:58.737 --> 13:02.282
'led by a man going by the name
of Victor Crespo.'

13:02.407 --> 13:03.909
- Motherfucker.
- 'In the next few days...

13:04.034 --> 13:05.952
'we'll be publishing
an investigative series

13:06.077 --> 13:09.080
'about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.208
'This operation is much larger
than it seems...'

13:11.333 --> 13:13.502
"No speak Spanish", my ass.

13:14.795 --> 13:18.799
- So that means we have to leave, right?
- No, my love.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.176
This man,
he knows who you are, Chepe.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.553
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.263
Is that so?

13:26.348 --> 13:28.850
So do me a favour and fix this.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.312
You hear me?

13:39.903 --> 13:41.530
Motherfucker.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.699
So a new surrender deal.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.452
Three years in jail. All of you.

13:47.577 --> 13:51.206
Turn in the illicit businesses,
and we can keep all of the legal assets,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.875
as in the old plan.
It's a good deal.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.669
He would've told you himself,

13:55.794 --> 13:58.213
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.507
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.510
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.850
An update?

14:09.975 --> 14:13.728
On our efforts to maximise business
before surrender.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.526
- So I can inform my father.
- Tell him everything's still on track here.

14:19.651 --> 14:24.072
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.534
And this accident in New York?

14:30.579 --> 14:33.707
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.667
I'm not worried.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.628
Are we done?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.798
One last thing.

14:41.923 --> 14:46.636
Our friends in Bogotá are concerned
about their exposure.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.930
Too many people know
about the deal.

14:49.806 --> 14:54.769
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.
My father would like you to handle it.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.233
"Handle it"? Do you know
what you're talking about?

15:00.358 --> 15:03.403
Do you have any idea? Hmm?

15:06.990 --> 15:11.870
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali
and is not easily replaced.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.997
He's too valuable to just kill.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.584
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.379
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.551
Take care.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.440
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.400
His father's orders.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.614
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.075
Keep an eye on him.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.455
You decided if you're coming tonight?

15:57.290 --> 16:01.628
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.
It's important.

16:01.753 --> 16:06.132
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.511
Which is exactly why you should go.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.765
Dad, you're the new boss here.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.892
Please, show them.

16:17.727 --> 16:22.857
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.276
'Now why would
a Cali godfather come out of hiding

16:25.402 --> 16:27.404
'and risk getting captured?

16:27.529 --> 16:31.324
'Because what good is being the king
if nobody knows it?

16:31.449 --> 16:34.911
'The biggest thing to come out of Cali
wasn't cocaine.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.955
'It was salsa.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.291
'And every year, the two combined
at the annual <i>Feria de Cali,</i>

16:40.417 --> 16:44.629
'a week-long extravaganza
of parties and salsa concerts.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.383
'And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.010
'Gilberto Rodríguez.'

16:50.135 --> 16:52.595
Cheers, gentlemen!

16:52.721 --> 16:56.141
'But with him in jail,
it was time for a new king.'

16:56.266 --> 16:59.269
How would you
like to be my date tonight?

16:59.394 --> 17:02.689
Hmm...
Where would we go?

17:03.982 --> 17:05.692
Come here.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.908
Let's go dancing.
Do you like dancing?

17:14.826 --> 17:19.622
As you discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.916
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.836
Come in.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.640
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

17:37.766 --> 17:40.935
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.480
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

17:43.605 --> 17:47.567
Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.028
- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.822
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.949
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

17:56.159 --> 17:57.911
Really, Patricia.
Are you going to smoke inside?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.954
What's the problem? This is a dump.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.833
- The boys are here.
- Now you're concerned about the boys?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.378
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

18:16.346 --> 18:20.475
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

18:22.519 --> 18:25.146
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.233
All right, last hit
Duffy and López had on Salcedo,

18:28.358 --> 18:30.276
he was deputy chief of security
for the cartel.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.195
All right. So that much is true.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.613
Had a degree in engineering.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.117
Business license for a bio-diesel factory
that went belly up.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.701
- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.079
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.706
Who became head of security
for the cartel.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.250
Must've been how he got the job.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.710
Wonder if he clipped his old buddy
to take his spot.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.588
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.132
Oh, just that?

18:52.257 --> 18:55.051
Does that sound like the everyman
who only signed on

18:55.176 --> 18:57.178
- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.682
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.394
Scumbags I can handle.
What I don't like are liars.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.605
So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

19:08.648 --> 19:11.025
- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

19:11.151 --> 19:13.570
we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.826
I'm telling you, they're done.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.912
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

19:23.037 --> 19:26.457
And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

19:26.583 --> 19:29.586
And Miguel's in charge
of everything here.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.715
'Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.'

19:33.840 --> 19:35.758
And you intend to...?

19:35.884 --> 19:40.805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.100
Which is why I'm talking to you.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.441
Funny how things change, isn't it?

19:52.150 --> 19:55.486
So, Amado... what do you say?

19:59.199 --> 20:02.994
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.456
But we both see the future
the same way.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.959
Look, starting next week...

20:11.085 --> 20:15.840
...I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

20:15.965 --> 20:19.886
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

20:29.812 --> 20:31.898
Look, I need you
to make room here.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.902
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.321
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.740
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.283
Understood?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.995
I was told you needed me.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.040
I need to talk about something.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
Leave your bitch down here.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.127
Come on.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.559
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

21:10.645 --> 21:15.191
I was thinking about what you said
if I ever need your advice...

21:16.484 --> 21:18.111
...and I could use your help.

21:18.236 --> 21:22.073
- With your father's security?
- He's coming to the party tonight.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.492
He's coming here?

21:24.617 --> 21:28.621
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.418
What do you want me to tell you, David?

21:34.002 --> 21:37.213
- Public places are always bad.
- I know.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.048
Too many people.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.971
- When does he plan on arriving?
- I was thinking around eleven.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.891
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

21:49.017 --> 21:52.103
Well, I think ten is better.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.065
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.442
You'll take care of it?

22:00.611 --> 22:02.905
I knew I could count on you.

22:05.033 --> 22:09.454
I just need this night to be perfect.
Everything has to go well.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.875
You can relax.
I think we can manage that.

22:23.217 --> 22:26.054
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

22:26.179 --> 22:29.891
- Of course. You think he listened?
- He's an imbecile.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.895
Pull over here.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.065
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.446
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.751
- Hello?
- 'It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.'

23:40.336 --> 23:43.381
- You got us both.
- Miguel's going to a party tonight.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.259
'Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.'

23:46.384 --> 23:49.262
It's gonna be crowded, so you have
to wait to get him until he's outside.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.056
Is there any way we can check this, Jorge?

23:53.266 --> 23:54.976
No. You're gonna have to trust me.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.187
'And this promotion to security chief?
How'd that come about?'

23:58.312 --> 24:00.064
That's... really complicated.

24:01.315 --> 24:05.445
We're trying to understand why
you'd call us a day after you get a raise.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.447
'We don't have time for this right now.

24:07.572 --> 24:11.075
'He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.'

24:11.200 --> 24:13.035
Take him outside.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.462
- Hey. What's going on?
- Nothing, boss.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.005
- Is he bothering you?
- No, sir.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.507
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.092
- You want some?
- Sure.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.678
"Complicated."
Everything with this guy is complicated.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.680
Still, there's something about him
I believe.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.557
Enough to walk into a cartel party blind?

24:34.682 --> 24:37.643
For a chance
to get Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.938
He's just stringing us along, Chris.
Or worse.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.373
Stop! Hey!

25:43.209 --> 25:44.502
Hey! Come here!

26:21.455 --> 26:23.332
Get the back. Get the back.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.220
Fuck!

27:36.989 --> 27:38.240
Don't run.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.928
Franklin Jurado...

28:00.179 --> 28:04.183
Javier Peña, DEA. You're being extradited
for money laundering and racketeering.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.561
- My wife. You need to make sure...
- She's in Bogotá.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.355
She'll meet us in Miami.

28:16.570 --> 28:19.532
'Ambassador,
I've got Agent Peña, line one.'

28:19.657 --> 28:21.951
- 'Peña?'
- We got him.

28:22.076 --> 28:25.621
I'd like to get him into the United States
before the cartel knows he's in custody.

28:25.746 --> 28:28.874
I spoke to the Prime Minister
this morning. Extradition papers are set.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.043
As soon as he starts talking,
you let me know.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.671
- 'I'll update Justice.'
- Yeah, will do, sir.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.840
'Agent Peña. Good work.'

28:39.969 --> 28:42.888
- Let's see here.
- Zuelma prays every morning.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.473
Very good. And here?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.977
- The worm...
- Gotero...

28:48.102 --> 28:50.020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

28:53.065 --> 28:56.861
- I need to speak to you.
- Okay. Girls...

28:57.653 --> 29:00.448
Please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.081
Something came up.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.627
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.548
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.886
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight.

29:22.011 --> 29:25.848
But for now, I want you to get
everything ready to leave.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.769
- Where are we going? How...
- Do you trust me?

29:31.562 --> 29:36.150
My love...
Paola... do you trust me?

29:37.485 --> 29:38.736
Yes?

29:42.198 --> 29:44.200
Everything will be all right.
I promise.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.876
Done. I'm finished.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.588
I love that length on you.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.673
Thank you. I like it, too.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.386
And a little extra for you.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.933
And I have a little extra for you, too.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.523
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.719
You were the one
who approached my wife?

30:47.555 --> 30:49.223
You enjoy it?

30:50.391 --> 30:52.935
Using her to get to me?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.771
You know what I'd be
thinking about if I were you, Franklin?

30:55.896 --> 30:59.483
That if your wife wants to see you...

31:01.610 --> 31:03.445
...she's gonna see you in jail.

31:04.655 --> 31:06.365
Drive hours every week.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.535
Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

31:09.660 --> 31:11.996
is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.790
You can say whatever you want.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.919
- You can't scare me.
- No...

31:20.087 --> 31:22.423
I can just ruin your life.

31:23.549 --> 31:27.094
You know the brothers.
Pretty well.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.432
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

31:32.683 --> 31:36.228
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.647
You really want to spend it in a cell?

31:40.608 --> 31:44.111
Talk to me. I'll get you a deal.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.574
You and Christina... can start over.

31:50.659 --> 31:54.038
Have a new life.
In the United States.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.377
I'm not going to say a single word...

32:02.630 --> 32:04.632
...until I see my wife.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.511
Okay.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.808
Then you'll have your witness.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.989
Stop. Stop here.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.207
Turn around.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.592
Franklin.
His name is Franklin Jurado.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.135
- Jurado or...
- 'Yes, ma'am.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.263
'We've called his room several times.
We're unable to locate him.'

32:53.389 --> 32:54.974
Okay, well, did he check out?

32:55.099 --> 32:58.435
Have you seen him at all?
It sounds like you don't know anything.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.562
'We haven't seen him
and he has not checked out.'

33:00.688 --> 33:02.690
'I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.

33:02.815 --> 33:05.359
'Thank you for calling
Baoase Luxury Resort.'

33:05.484 --> 33:07.069
No, thank you.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.196
Thank you for fucking nothing.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.602
Manny.
Thanks for meeting.

33:42.438 --> 33:46.650
Julia said you might have
something on Crespo?

33:55.159 --> 33:56.493
Well, yes.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.123
It's something I hope you like.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.336
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

34:07.296 --> 34:09.798
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

34:09.923 --> 34:12.009
Well...

34:13.802 --> 34:16.138
I was hoping I could help you.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.682
Where are you from?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.857
When you were young,

34:26.982 --> 34:32.321
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.659
Well, I did.

34:37.785 --> 34:42.122
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York,

34:42.247 --> 34:44.208
to build something important.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.336
That was also my dream.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.881
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

34:51.006 --> 34:55.302
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.554
Whatever it is.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.890
Regardless how much it costs.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.642
In dollars.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.690
You think you and I are the same

35:08.816 --> 35:11.318
because we came
to this country with dreams?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.070
Well...

35:13.195 --> 35:16.573
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.285
You came to sell cocaine.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.163
Yes, we are both immigrants,

35:23.288 --> 35:27.042
but we have nothing in common,
Mr. Santacruz.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.340
My story is going to print.

35:39.721 --> 35:43.016
Okay.
Thank you for hearing my proposal.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.479
Can I ask you a question?

35:49.022 --> 35:53.861
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

35:54.778 --> 35:56.613
I have no idea.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.199
An hour or so.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.830
I'll miss a lot about New York.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.458
But not the traffic.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

36:58.926 --> 37:01.136
- Good evening.
- Hello. How are you?

37:01.261 --> 37:04.264
Good evening. Welcome.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.183
Good evening.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.735
Good to see you, David.
What's up?

37:16.860 --> 37:19.321
Looks like the whole family
showed up.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.490
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

37:36.463 --> 37:40.550
You know what? I don't want
this many people up here.

38:14.334 --> 38:17.296
Good evening!
Welcome to the Cali Fair!

38:21.216 --> 38:25.345
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

38:25.470 --> 38:29.057
and our patron,
Mr. Miguel Rodríguez!

38:32.936 --> 38:34.688
Come. Come here.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.774
Come! Come here!

38:47.159 --> 38:49.036
Say a few words.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.007
Thank you all for coming.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.594
Please, enjoy the party.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.039
Your brother's a character.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.463
Well... my shift started already.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.466
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.802
You're giving me a tip.

40:36.977 --> 40:40.147
- I told you he'd be here.
- You came through.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.816
I also said to take him outside.
It's too risky in here.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.652
Tell your men to wait
until he's leaving.

40:54.453 --> 40:58.707
- What men are you talking about?
- Your men standing by the DJ booth.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.835
We came tonight to make sure
you were telling the truth.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.171
We didn't bring any men.

41:04.296 --> 41:07.632
- Fuck are you talking about?
- What?

41:09.426 --> 41:12.596
- What's wrong?
- Fuck. You need to go. Go!

41:19.603 --> 41:22.063
Shh.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.232
We aren't here for you.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.652
Where is Pacho?

41:28.612 --> 41:30.030
Pacho!

41:43.084 --> 41:44.753
I need to talk to you.

41:44.878 --> 41:47.964
- Don't interrupt me...
- We have a problem. We have to leave.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.091
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

41:50.217 --> 41:52.844
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

41:52.969 --> 41:55.514
We have to leave, sir. Please.

42:03.396 --> 42:04.856
Get down!

42:09.736 --> 42:11.112
Go! Watch out!

42:11.238 --> 42:12.405
Pacho!

42:36.346 --> 42:38.139
Watch out!

42:38.890 --> 42:41.351
Stay there!

42:43.061 --> 42:44.896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

42:45.522 --> 42:47.232
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

42:47.357 --> 42:49.067
Keep moving.

42:50.318 --> 42:53.154
- When I run...
- They're over here.

42:56.032 --> 42:57.200
Shit!

43:01.955 --> 43:04.082
Give me the gun.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.922
Go ahead.

43:13.967 --> 43:15.635
Are you all right?

43:16.720 --> 43:17.846
Motherfucker!

43:18.847 --> 43:20.932
Álvaro!

43:34.154 --> 43:36.781
Shoot them! Shoot them!

43:36.906 --> 43:37.949
Go!

43:40.410 --> 43:41.536
Over there!

44:04.601 --> 44:06.603
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

44:06.728 --> 44:08.605
Head down!

44:08.730 --> 44:11.691
- Slow down.
- Move it!

44:11.816 --> 44:13.318
Motherfucker!

44:13.443 --> 44:15.487
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

44:19.282 --> 44:20.700
This shit...

44:27.540 --> 44:29.709
Little brother, I need you to shoot.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.712
Your gun. Keep shooting at them.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.172
Pacho...

44:45.308 --> 44:47.811
- Head down!
- I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

44:48.603 --> 44:50.188
Over here!

45:00.448 --> 45:02.117
Who drove the car?

45:04.661 --> 45:07.038
You got here by car.
Who was driving?

45:07.163 --> 45:09.958
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.376
Fuck you.

45:25.515 --> 45:26.641
Peña.

45:26.766 --> 45:29.018
'There are men
at my apartment.'

45:29.144 --> 45:30.979
- Yeah, they're ours.
- Yeah, no shit.

45:31.104 --> 45:32.272
'Are you with them?'

45:32.397 --> 45:34.774
No. I saw them and I freaked out,
so I left.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.193
They're meant to protect you.
Have you talked to anyone?

45:37.318 --> 45:40.321
No, I tried calling Franklin,
but I couldn't get in touch with him.

45:40.447 --> 45:42.449
'What the fuck is going on?'

45:43.408 --> 45:47.162
- We arrested Franklin.
- You did what?

45:47.287 --> 45:49.289
'Christina, listen to me.'

45:49.414 --> 45:51.458
I... You fucking asshole.

45:51.583 --> 45:54.544
- Listen to me.
- I told you I was gonna talk to him.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.255
- I told you.
- Christina. You want it? This is it.

45:57.380 --> 46:00.175
As soon as we hang up the phone,
you get yourself to the American Embassy.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.594
'You don't talk to anyone,
you don't call anyone.

46:02.719 --> 46:04.846
- 'You get yourself there.'
- Okay.

46:16.566 --> 46:18.777
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:20.987 --> 46:24.407
- Are we close?
- Yes. It's just around the corner.

46:25.784 --> 46:29.287
Thank you.
You saved me. Really.

46:30.663 --> 46:34.501
Just tell your friends about me.
But only the ones with money.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.438
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

46:59.025 --> 47:01.402
When is this car gonna move?

47:08.159 --> 47:10.286
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

47:10.411 --> 47:13.081
- Oh, my God.
- God.

47:13.206 --> 47:16.376
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

47:46.990 --> 47:49.450
We start with just the basics. Okay?

47:49.576 --> 47:52.704
Where they move the money,
where they keep the money.

48:02.255 --> 48:04.507
Let me guess.
It's his fucking lawyer?

48:09.429 --> 48:13.516
Agent Peña.
Alan Starkman. Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

48:13.641 --> 48:17.270
Yeah. Your client has indicated he's open
to a deal in exchange for testimony.

48:17.395 --> 48:20.023
Before he learned that
his wife won't be joining him.

48:20.148 --> 48:23.902
No. I've just spoken with his wife.
She's on her way to the embassy in Bogotá.

48:24.027 --> 48:27.572
Now, I was informed she never arrived.

48:27.697 --> 48:29.741
Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

48:32.327 --> 48:38.666
It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers... instead.

48:40.877 --> 48:42.879
I guess she's had a change of heart.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.843
Whatever deal you had with my client...
is off.

49:04.484 --> 49:06.694
Dad! Are you okay?

49:06.819 --> 49:08.154
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

49:08.279 --> 49:11.282
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

49:11.407 --> 49:14.702
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.413
Pacho's okay.
They're on their way back.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.375
Are you okay?

49:20.500 --> 49:23.836
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.964
Darío, please take her upstairs.

49:26.673 --> 49:28.174
I'm coming soon.

49:35.932 --> 49:37.558
What happened there?

49:38.434 --> 49:40.103
It looked like...

49:41.646 --> 49:43.898
...like you knew
something was coming.

49:44.857 --> 49:48.027
Jorge, you know what? I know why.

49:50.780 --> 49:53.241
Because you are always working.

49:53.950 --> 49:56.244
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

49:57.245 --> 50:00.081
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

50:01.249 --> 50:05.253
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

50:05.378 --> 50:07.338
Only you, Jorge.

50:08.423 --> 50:10.174
Of course, Don Miguel.

50:10.299 --> 50:14.637
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

50:14.762 --> 50:17.849
So I need to know
where you are at all times.

50:17.974 --> 50:19.434
Tomorrow is another day.

50:27.692 --> 50:30.486
- 'Gilberto, it's me.'
- Thank God.

50:30.611 --> 50:32.864
- How are you, brother?
- 'We're okay.

50:32.989 --> 50:35.742
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

50:35.867 --> 50:38.828
- 'Pacho? No, it can't be...'
- No, he's okay. He survived.

50:38.953 --> 50:41.164
- 'He's on his way home.'
- Thank God.

50:41.289 --> 50:45.084
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

50:45.209 --> 50:49.088
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

50:49.213 --> 50:51.174
Everybody's watching.

50:51.299 --> 50:56.345
- 'It could ruin everything.'
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

50:56.471 --> 50:58.514
They tried to kill my son.

50:58.639 --> 51:01.476
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

51:01.601 --> 51:03.686
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

51:05.271 --> 51:08.566
...for now,
we can't afford to start a war.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.651
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

51:10.777 --> 51:13.279
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

51:13.404 --> 51:16.074
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

51:16.199 --> 51:20.787
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

51:21.746 --> 51:25.291
You'll see.
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

51:27.168 --> 51:29.170
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

51:50.233 --> 51:51.859
It's Salcedo.

51:58.074 --> 51:59.909
- You alone?
- Yeah.

52:00.034 --> 52:02.453
- Get the fuck in.
- How the fuck did you know where we were?

52:02.578 --> 52:05.748
The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I would bring a gun here?

52:05.873 --> 52:08.334
- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there tonight?

52:08.459 --> 52:10.169
Because you never gave us
a straight answer.

52:10.294 --> 52:13.089
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

52:13.214 --> 52:15.925
How's the North Valley
shooting up the place gonna help me?

52:16.050 --> 52:19.345
You look like a hero,
escorting Miguel out the back.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.013
I had to do my job.

52:21.139 --> 52:23.141
You're still not telling us
the fucking truth.

52:23.266 --> 52:25.101
They killed the guy I replaced.

52:26.435 --> 52:27.895
And they killed his wife.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.773
And they're gonna do the same thing
to me and my family.

52:30.898 --> 52:35.862
And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

52:35.987 --> 52:37.321
Yeah.

52:38.447 --> 52:41.367
Then we need to trust each other.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:45.121 --> 52:47.290
Tell me you know where Miguel is.

52:58.217 --> 53:02.597
This is a skypager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

53:02.722 --> 53:04.557
We'll be in touch.

53:07.602 --> 53:10.062
'Over 15 people were killed,

53:10.188 --> 53:11.939
'with dozens more injured
and in critical condition,

53:12.064 --> 53:15.401
'in a deadly shootout tonight
at the kick-off party for the Cali Fair.

53:15.526 --> 53:18.446
'Police say it's too early to say
what caused the incident...'

53:21.657 --> 53:24.452
- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

53:24.577 --> 53:26.913
- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

53:28.164 --> 53:31.042
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

53:31.167 --> 53:33.377
Where are we going?

53:33.502 --> 53:37.048
Why do we have to leave?
What's going on?

53:38.090 --> 53:40.092
Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

53:42.678 --> 53:44.847
Tell me what's going on right now!

53:45.681 --> 53:47.558
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

53:47.683 --> 53:49.685
You can't tell anyone, understand?

53:52.021 --> 53:54.023
I'm working for the Americans.

53:56.359 --> 53:57.777
It can't be.

53:59.403 --> 54:00.863
It can't be.

54:00.988 --> 54:04.075
I contacted the DEA.
I'm giving them Miguel.

54:04.533 --> 54:07.411
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

54:08.955 --> 54:11.749
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

54:14.460 --> 54:16.087
You're crazy.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.382
They're going to kill all of us.

54:19.507 --> 54:22.468
- You're insane. What were you thinking?
- Paola...

54:30.643 --> 54:33.980
'Things don't always go
according to plan.

54:34.105 --> 54:39.068
'You can use every hope and prayer
you have, take your shot,

54:39.193 --> 54:41.237
'and everything still goes to shit.

54:42.196 --> 54:47.868
'And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.

54:47.994 --> 54:52.790
'That's when people get desperate.
And things get dangerous.'

54:54.959 --> 54:58.921
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

54:59.046 --> 55:02.550
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

55:02.675 --> 55:05.136
North Valley attacked us.

55:05.261 --> 55:07.555
Their intentions were clear.

55:08.681 --> 55:13.060
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

55:13.185 --> 55:15.813
Weak, with me in charge.

55:15.938 --> 55:18.691
They're trying to destroy us.

55:20.026 --> 55:22.028
Take what's ours.

55:25.740 --> 55:27.158
I...

55:28.367 --> 55:33.497
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

55:33.622 --> 55:38.044
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

55:38.169 --> 55:40.546
what we've worked so hard to build.

55:44.508 --> 55:45.926
War.

55:52.016 --> 55:54.018
This is Gilberto's decision?

55:58.647 --> 55:59.857
It's...

56:00.858 --> 56:02.234
...mine.
