00:31.409 --> 00:34.401
- Oh, I am so glad to see you.
- Is that because I can work tonight?

00:34.569 --> 00:38.608
Or is it because I am now
Phoebe Halliwell, college student?

00:38.809 --> 00:40.879
Okay, neat, thin slices, please.

00:41.049 --> 00:43.927
Wait, you enrolled?
Phoebe, this is huge.

00:44.569 --> 00:46.446
Hugest thing I've done
since I came back home.

00:46.609 --> 00:48.440
I mean, aside
from vanquishing demons

00:48.609 --> 00:50.645
and saving the world from evil,
of course.

00:51.489 --> 00:55.528
Okay, so I signed up
for two general courses.

00:56.009 --> 00:58.443
And seven electives.
Seven, Phoebe?

00:58.649 --> 01:01.447
All right, so I'm a little confused.
I could use some advice.

01:01.609 --> 01:03.725
What do you think I should take?

01:05.169 --> 01:07.603
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a little cough.

01:08.089 --> 01:10.080
I bet Prue made you have soup
at lunch today

01:10.249 --> 01:13.366
- after she heard that little cough.
- I had to cancel, actually.

01:13.529 --> 01:16.362
Last night's paperwork took
a lot longer than I expected.

01:16.569 --> 01:18.685
So I guess you missed
your massage today also?

01:19.009 --> 01:20.965
A reporter from
the San Francisco Weekly called

01:21.129 --> 01:22.767
and had a ton of questions
about the club.

01:22.969 --> 01:25.039
Piper, you have got
to take care of yourself.

01:25.249 --> 01:26.841
You've been feeling funky
since yesterday.

01:27.009 --> 01:29.204
- It's probably just a bug.
- Even more reason for you

01:29.369 --> 01:32.202
- not to push it.
- I'm fine. Besides, it's all paying off.

01:32.369 --> 01:34.724
The club is finally doing well,
and we're making money.

01:35.089 --> 01:36.442
Now, would you slice?

01:37.009 --> 01:38.886
What kind of fruit is this, anyway?

01:39.049 --> 01:41.517
Kiwano. It's from South America.
It's great for Mai Tais.

01:42.289 --> 01:44.200
Just got them in yesterday, actually.

01:44.369 --> 01:46.883
The bartender has a connection
at the docks.

01:47.049 --> 01:50.644
- Wait, you smuggled it in?
- Oh, it's fruit, Phoebe, not drugs.

01:51.729 --> 01:54.960
You know, just because we're witches
does not mean that you're invincible.

01:55.569 --> 01:58.129
Okay, you need to start
taking care of yourself.

01:58.449 --> 01:59.643
Thank you, doctor.

02:00.289 --> 02:04.362
Hey, Dr. Phoebe Halliwell.
I like it.

02:08.609 --> 02:10.485
It's late. Let's just get this done.

02:10.689 --> 02:13.442
Well, it certainly appears
to be a Monet.

02:13.609 --> 02:15.520
Has the same style
that he enjoyed in Paris

02:15.689 --> 02:18.487
after the Exposition Universelle.

02:19.129 --> 02:21.802
The same delicate,
powdery interpretations

02:21.969 --> 02:24.199
combined with great vigour
and expressiveness.

02:24.369 --> 02:26.564
"Great vigour"?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.606
Randy little painter, was he?

02:28.769 --> 02:30.407
The brushstrokes
around the smokestack

02:30.569 --> 02:32.480
are somewhat unusual for Monet.

02:32.689 --> 02:36.318
They seem almost individual,
although beautifully rendered.

02:36.889 --> 02:39.039
Well, no complaints
about my view either.

02:40.089 --> 02:42.683
Okay, you know what?
Is everything with you sexual?

02:43.489 --> 02:44.842
No.

02:45.569 --> 02:48.845
Okay, you've never
thought about me?

02:49.049 --> 02:50.687
Jack, come on.
We don't have very much time

02:50.849 --> 02:53.409
- to authenticate this painting.
- Not even just a little?

02:54.049 --> 02:57.280
Okay, fine. Maybe just a little.

02:57.609 --> 02:58.928
And I was good, wasn't I?

03:00.489 --> 03:03.959
Come on, Prue, I'm not pushing this.
I just... I know where you stand.

03:04.129 --> 03:06.848
I just wanna know where I stand.
With you.

03:07.529 --> 03:11.078
- How are you two doing?
- Oh, we're fine.

03:11.289 --> 03:13.439
Exactly where we should be
at the moment.

03:13.609 --> 03:15.565
As long as it's authenticated
by the auction.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.959
I've got eight buyers on the block
interested in that piece.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.161
You don't have to worry
about us, Mr. Caldwell.

03:20.369 --> 03:21.802
Good.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.086
Do I have to worry about us?

03:32.889 --> 03:35.119
Piper, you need to go home.
You're sick.

03:35.289 --> 03:36.927
I think we're over
our occupancy limit.

03:37.089 --> 03:38.886
I don't want the fire marshal
to shut us down.

03:39.049 --> 03:40.482
Piper, you need to go home.

03:40.649 --> 03:43.368
Phoebe, I'm fine! I'm just...

03:46.489 --> 03:48.320
- Maybe you're right.
- Oh, my God!

03:48.529 --> 03:50.724
Call 911! Piper. Piper!

05:25.649 --> 05:27.526
Hey.

05:27.929 --> 05:29.408
Prue?

05:30.289 --> 05:32.166
You're awake.

05:34.569 --> 05:37.800
- What happened?
- You don't remember?

05:39.929 --> 05:42.762
I remember being in the club
and talking to Phoebe.

05:42.929 --> 05:46.046
And then, I gotta admit,
it's a little fuzzy.

05:46.209 --> 05:48.439
You collapsed,
someone called an ambulance.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.759
Oh, that must have been great
for business.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.798
So, what's wrong with me?

05:55.049 --> 05:57.927
They don't really know. We're just
sort of waiting for blood-test results.

05:59.649 --> 06:01.162
I'm sure it's nothing too exciting.

06:01.329 --> 06:05.117
It's probably something trendy like
mono or Epstein-Barr.

06:05.889 --> 06:08.722
Yeah, well, whatever it is, you're
gonna take the time to get better.

06:08.889 --> 06:11.084
Now you sound like Phoebe.

06:11.249 --> 06:12.807
Where is she, anyway?

06:14.649 --> 06:15.968
Hi.

06:16.689 --> 06:18.088
Nurse person?

06:18.249 --> 06:20.638
Hi. Can you tell me
where Dr. Wallace is?

06:20.809 --> 06:23.277
He said that my sister's test results
should be in by 8,

06:23.449 --> 06:25.201
and it's 20 past 8 now.

06:25.569 --> 06:28.322
- What's your sister's name?
- Piper, Piper Halliwell. Thank you.

06:28.529 --> 06:29.644
Piper Halliwell.

06:30.609 --> 06:33.123
Piper Halliwell's been transferred
to Dr. Williamson's care.

06:33.329 --> 06:34.887
If you have a seat in the waiting area,

06:35.049 --> 06:36.846
- I'll page him.
- What happened to Dr. Wallace?

06:37.529 --> 06:40.601
I'm sure that Dr. Williamson will be
able to answer all of your questions.

06:41.049 --> 06:43.279
Please, have a seat
in the waiting room.

06:43.449 --> 06:44.848
Okay.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.838
- Are you sick too?
- No, I'm not sick.

07:02.329 --> 07:04.001
Then why do you look so sad?

07:06.289 --> 07:09.122
My sister's here and they don't know
what's wrong with her.

07:10.369 --> 07:13.042
The doctors don't know
what's wrong with me either.

07:13.209 --> 07:16.167
Maybe your sister and I
have the same thing.

07:18.209 --> 07:20.518
- What is your name?
- Nathan.

07:21.169 --> 07:25.720
Well, hello, Nathan. I'm Phoebe.
And who is that?

07:25.889 --> 07:29.120
Ninja doll. Found him
in the children's ward.

07:30.289 --> 07:31.563
You know,

07:31.729 --> 07:33.799
I don't think that's just any ninja doll.

07:34.409 --> 07:36.525
If I know my ninja dolls,

07:36.729 --> 07:39.084
I think that one's really
a magical wi...

07:40.289 --> 07:42.678
- zard. Wizard.

07:42.889 --> 07:47.121
- Really? How can you tell?
- Well, let me see him.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.799
I've seen what his type can do.

07:50.969 --> 07:55.201
He's got powers. He can move things
and freeze things.

07:55.369 --> 07:58.008
And he could kick-box too.

07:59.009 --> 08:03.241
And the really cool thing about him
is he could do all this to the demon...

08:03.689 --> 08:08.888
To the bad guys inside your body
without anyone even knowing about it.

08:09.129 --> 08:12.201
Really? He can freeze the bad guys
and move them?

08:12.369 --> 08:16.521
And kick-box them too, don't
forget that. Right out of your body.

08:17.689 --> 08:20.999
All you have to do is,
when you feel bad,

08:21.169 --> 08:25.879
you close your eyes and just
picture him fighting them for you.

08:26.249 --> 08:29.207
- Do you think you can do that?
- Yeah.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.408
- Phoebe Halliwell?
- Yes.

08:31.569 --> 08:33.082
- I'm Dr. Williamson.
- Hi.

08:33.249 --> 08:35.524
- Bye, it was nice to meet you, Nathan.
- See you.

08:35.688 --> 08:36.883
And who are they?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.438
Medical interns. They'll be
viewing my work with your sister.

08:39.609 --> 08:40.724
Because...?

08:40.889 --> 08:42.845
Because they're studying
the same field that I did.

08:43.009 --> 08:45.318
I'm an infectious-disease specialist.

08:47.889 --> 08:50.119
Specialist? Wait!

08:51.449 --> 08:54.202
Miss Halliwell?
I'm Dr. Williamson.

08:54.369 --> 08:56.121
He's a specialist.

08:56.289 --> 08:58.723
- Where's Dr. Wallace?
- I'll be keeping him posted.

08:58.889 --> 09:00.641
How are you feeling?

09:00.809 --> 09:03.607
Okay. A little hot, tired.

09:04.769 --> 09:06.919
Have you been out
of the country recently?

09:07.089 --> 09:09.523
Africa, South America, Caribbean?

09:09.689 --> 09:12.840
I wish. No, I haven't even been out
of the city. Why?

09:13.729 --> 09:15.640
Well, apparently you've contracted
a blood disease

09:15.809 --> 09:18.403
rarely seen in the United States.
Oroya fever.

09:19.729 --> 09:22.004
- How is that possible?
- Well, Oroya fever is transmitted

09:22.169 --> 09:24.729
through the bite of a sand fly
which dies right after the bite.

09:24.889 --> 09:27.357
Have you had anything imported,
brought into your home recently?

09:27.529 --> 09:30.043
- No.
- But you have in the club.

09:30.249 --> 09:32.205
What was the name
of that weird fruit?

09:33.969 --> 09:36.847
- Kiwano.
- That's a possible carrier.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.079
Sometimes the fly has been known
to live in the crate

09:39.249 --> 09:42.639
long enough to make the trip, but
rarely survives the quarantine period.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.565
I think...

09:45.729 --> 09:47.447
...I have a bite on my shoulder.

09:50.649 --> 09:52.367
- When did you get this?
- Yesterday.

09:52.529 --> 09:54.838
Just after I opened the fruit.

09:55.009 --> 09:56.601
Tell a nurse I need 10 cc's
of Penilovin.

09:56.849 --> 09:58.362
- Right away.
- It's an antibiotic

09:58.529 --> 10:00.724
most effective when administered
through an IV.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.245
It should bring your fever down.

10:04.569 --> 10:06.924
I gotta run some more tests.
I'll be back shortly.

10:08.089 --> 10:10.922
Excuse me.
She's gonna be okay, right?

10:12.089 --> 10:14.398
I mean, it's not life-threatening?

10:15.289 --> 10:18.440
Well, I'll know better after
I run more tests. Excuse me.

10:31.049 --> 10:32.528
I'll be okay.

10:33.009 --> 10:36.206
Yeah, I mean, he didn't seem too
worried. Just prescribed antibiotics.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.961
The tests are just to confirm
his diagnosis, I'm sure.

10:40.129 --> 10:41.926
Yeah. Don't you agree, Phoebe?

10:42.089 --> 10:43.408
I think we should call Leo.

10:43.929 --> 10:46.443
- Why?
- Why not? He can heal you.

10:46.929 --> 10:50.046
No. He's out of our lives. He's
not even our whitelighter anymore.

10:50.209 --> 10:53.121
Besides, with Dan in my life...

10:53.329 --> 10:56.605
- But if Leo knew you were sick?
- No, and that's final.

10:56.809 --> 10:58.800
No demon or warlock
did this to me.

10:59.329 --> 11:01.923
Just let the doctors do their magic.

11:02.449 --> 11:05.964
All right. Well, I just wanted you
to get well soon.

11:06.889 --> 11:09.198
I know. And I will.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.122
Now, you two guys get out of here.
Prue, go to Buckland's.

11:12.289 --> 11:15.725
Phoebe, go to wherever it is
you go to.

11:15.969 --> 11:18.961
And somebody please call
Dan so he doesn't worry.

11:19.529 --> 11:22.441
Okay. Bye. Love you.

11:22.609 --> 11:24.406
I'll call you as soon as I can.

11:25.969 --> 11:28.403
- Okay, go. Go.
- I love you.

11:41.929 --> 11:43.282
Hey, have you had
a chance to look

11:43.449 --> 11:45.326
at the thread-density results
on the Monet?

11:45.489 --> 11:47.445
Yeah, and you were right.

11:47.609 --> 11:49.281
There are some
unexplained thread markings

11:49.449 --> 11:52.088
in the area around the station,
as well as the signature area.

11:52.249 --> 11:55.002
- Have you told Caldwell?
- Not yet.

11:55.169 --> 11:58.206
I was hoping to talk you
into going home first.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.803
Prue, you're exhausted.

12:00.969 --> 12:03.529
Yeah, I know. But I just prefer
to stay here, you know, keep busy.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.441
I mean, how long
can tests take, anyway?

12:05.649 --> 12:08.800
Hey. Piper is going to be fine.

12:09.289 --> 12:11.598
I know, it's just that...

12:12.769 --> 12:15.522
...after everything
that I've seen in my life,

12:16.089 --> 12:18.080
and believe me,
I've seen a lot of weird stuff,

12:18.729 --> 12:20.845
it takes a lot to scare me.

12:21.649 --> 12:24.368
But this time, I'm really scared.

12:26.809 --> 12:27.924
Hey.

12:31.929 --> 12:37.561
You know, I'm really not good
at this saying-the-right-thing stuff.

12:38.289 --> 12:39.961
You know what?

12:40.129 --> 12:42.120
Why don't you go back
to the hospital,

12:42.289 --> 12:45.326
and I'll stay here
and handle everything, okay?

12:49.809 --> 12:51.003
- Hello?
- This is Nurse Stone

12:51.169 --> 12:52.363
calling for Prue Halliwell.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.758
Is she gonna be okay?

12:54.929 --> 12:56.521
You know,
that's what's so frustrating.

12:56.689 --> 12:59.999
They won't tell us anything.
Damn doctors.

13:00.169 --> 13:01.648
Can I see her?
I mean, where is she?

13:01.809 --> 13:03.606
San Francisco Memorial.

13:05.129 --> 13:06.482
Hey.

13:06.649 --> 13:10.198
Nothing's gonna happen to her, okay?
Piper's strong and healthy.

13:10.369 --> 13:12.087
And she's a fighter.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.399
You noticed too, have you?

13:20.169 --> 13:21.841
- Hello?
- Yeah, Pheebs,

13:22.009 --> 13:23.567
the hospital just called.

13:23.729 --> 13:25.640
They need for us to get
down there right away.

13:25.809 --> 13:27.527
Why, what happened?

13:27.889 --> 13:30.642
Seventy-six-year-old man suffering
from blunt-force trauma to the head.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.243
We suspect a subdural haematoma.
Call for an MRI.

13:33.649 --> 13:36.527
Prue? What's going on?

13:36.689 --> 13:39.078
I don't know. All they said
is that her condition is worse.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.285
What is that supposed to mean?

13:42.369 --> 13:45.361
It means we're not gonna leave
the door until we find out.

13:46.289 --> 13:47.961
Dr. Williamson?

13:48.489 --> 13:50.081
Unfortunately, your sister's
immune system

13:50.249 --> 13:52.126
isn't as strong
as we thought it would be.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.359
And the antibiotic's having
no effect on the disease.

13:55.089 --> 13:57.523
So, what do we...?
What do you do now?

13:57.689 --> 14:00.203
Well, there's nothing more
we can do.

14:00.369 --> 14:02.929
Wait, what do you mean by that?
What are you saying?

14:03.089 --> 14:06.161
Well, either Piper pulls out of
the coma on her own,

14:06.329 --> 14:09.002
or I'm afraid your sister's
not going to survive.

14:34.169 --> 14:36.478
- Okay, we can't let Piper die.
- No, we can't.

14:36.649 --> 14:39.209
But, Prue, this isn't a demon
or a warlock that we're up against.

14:39.369 --> 14:41.166
If there are spells in here
to vanquish demons,

14:41.329 --> 14:43.445
there's gotta be a spell
to vanquish a lousy bug.

14:43.609 --> 14:45.008
Okay. But even if there is a spell,

14:45.169 --> 14:47.160
how do we get past
the personal-gain issue?

14:47.329 --> 14:49.126
- The consequences.
- What consequences?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.883
The power of three remains
unbroken, innocents are saved.

14:52.049 --> 14:53.528
I don't really see
a downside to that.

14:53.689 --> 14:54.963
- Do you?
- Prue, if good witches

14:55.129 --> 14:56.562
could really vanquish diseases,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.799
do you think there'd be
one sick person in the world?

14:59.369 --> 15:01.325
- Look, we have to save Piper.
- I agree.

15:01.489 --> 15:05.323
All I am saying is, before
we resort to the Book of Shadows...

15:05.489 --> 15:08.879
...maybe we should call Leo.
- No. She told us not to.

15:09.049 --> 15:12.405
So? Let her be pissed at us.
At least she'll be alive.

15:12.569 --> 15:15.037
We don't even know
how to contact him.

15:15.209 --> 15:17.643
I mean, he's always
just sort of been around.

15:18.369 --> 15:20.724
- Leo! Leo!
- Leo! Leo!

15:21.009 --> 15:23.648
- Leo! Leo!
- Leo! Leo!

15:25.409 --> 15:27.400
- It worked.
- All right, Leo, look, Piper is very...

15:27.569 --> 15:28.718
Very sick, I know.

15:29.169 --> 15:31.364
That's why I could hear you.
I've been nearby watching.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.480
Wait, you've been
watching her this whole time,

15:33.649 --> 15:35.640
- and you haven't healed her?
- I can't.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.084
They know about Piper too,
and they won't let me interfere.

15:38.249 --> 15:39.887
I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

15:40.049 --> 15:41.846
Leo, you can't just let Piper die.

15:42.009 --> 15:45.365
Don't you think I would do
something about it if I could?

15:45.529 --> 15:47.997
- But you love her.
- I know.

15:48.169 --> 15:50.603
But I'm not her whitelighter anymore.

15:50.769 --> 15:53.806
Besides, even if I could help her, my
powers probably wouldn't even work,

15:53.969 --> 15:56.278
because she wasn't hurt fighting evil.

15:57.969 --> 16:00.437
I have to go. They know I'm here.

16:01.009 --> 16:02.886
I'm sorry.

16:03.969 --> 16:05.368
Tell Piper I love her.

16:09.609 --> 16:11.725
Screw the consequences.

16:17.849 --> 16:19.805
You really think the awakening spell
is gonna work?

16:19.969 --> 16:21.960
It better. All right, look,
I'll get Piper's blood.

16:22.129 --> 16:23.767
Are you sure that you
can get a poppet?

16:23.929 --> 16:26.489
- Positive. I'll meet you in her room.
- All right.

16:34.649 --> 16:37.800
- How is she?
- No change.

16:39.329 --> 16:42.878
She just looks like she's sleeping.
But I can't wake her up.

16:46.609 --> 16:48.122
She'll wake up, I promise.

16:53.329 --> 16:54.967
Hey, Nathan. Remember me?

16:55.369 --> 16:56.848
Phoebe. I was hoping
you'd come back.

16:57.009 --> 16:59.807
- Really, why?
- You were right, the wizard did it.

16:59.969 --> 17:02.324
I feel great, just like I used to.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.401
- The power of positive thinking.
- The power of magic.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.763
The doctors are letting me
go home in a couple of days.

17:08.929 --> 17:12.239
Oh, that's great, Nathan,
I'm so happy for you.

17:12.888 --> 17:14.367
You know, I was wondering

17:14.529 --> 17:17.487
if you would let me borrow
the wizard for a while.

17:18.888 --> 17:21.608
My sister can use
a little magic right about now.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.642
She can keep him.

17:29.169 --> 17:32.161
- I don't need him anymore.
- Thank you.

17:34.529 --> 17:36.042
Hey.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.527
I was gonna bring us
back some sodas,

17:38.689 --> 17:40.202
but the machine down the hall
is busted.

17:40.369 --> 17:41.882
I didn't know where to find
another one.

17:42.049 --> 17:43.960
- Oh, I'll find it.
- Really? You don't mind?

17:44.129 --> 17:45.687
No, it's not any trouble.

17:45.849 --> 17:48.238
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.

17:51.329 --> 17:54.685
- I got him. Let's do this.
- All right.

18:10.249 --> 18:14.401
Trouble blood with sleep's unease
Remove the cause of this disease

18:15.049 --> 18:16.801
Prue!

18:18.769 --> 18:20.805
- Hey!
- Sleep eternal nevermore

18:20.969 --> 18:23.767
- And shift the source of illness borne
- Hey! Open the door!

18:23.969 --> 18:26.199
To this poppet
Whom none shall mourn

18:26.569 --> 18:28.241
What's going on in there?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.839
- Prue, it's not working.
- Unlock this door!

18:34.009 --> 18:35.681
Come on, open the door!

18:36.529 --> 18:38.485
- Hi.
- Open the door!

18:40.289 --> 18:42.405
Who was blocking the damn door?

18:42.569 --> 18:44.287
What's up, doc?

18:45.969 --> 18:49.848
When did this happen?
Miss Halliwell, are you feeling all right?

18:50.649 --> 18:55.404
Look at me. Vitals are normal.
Pupils are normal...

19:02.129 --> 19:05.326
- Halliwell pulled out of the coma.
- She stabilized.

19:08.129 --> 19:10.484
- Piper.
- Are those for me?

19:12.529 --> 19:16.204
- You're okay?
- Yes, I am okay.

19:16.569 --> 19:19.481
This doesn't make any sense.
Fever's gone, vitals are normal.

19:19.649 --> 19:22.038
I've never seen anything like it.

19:22.209 --> 19:25.326
- Point of infection's gone too.
- So can I go home now?

19:26.049 --> 19:27.926
Draw some blood.
I wanna run comparatives.

19:28.089 --> 19:30.967
Then can I go home? Because
no offence, but I hate hospitals.

19:35.729 --> 19:37.048
Get off me.

19:53.169 --> 19:56.844
Cleanup in room 420, please.
Cleanup in room 420.

20:09.089 --> 20:11.000
Turn it up! Up!

20:12.929 --> 20:15.397
All right, Malik, you can go home.
I'll clean up.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.448
Dance with me, Dan.

20:21.609 --> 20:24.169
- It's almost 2 in the morning.
- So what? Come on, you're young!

20:24.329 --> 20:28.004
No, stop the music.
Stop that music.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.248
- Somebody need a nap?
- You know what, that's not fair.

20:32.409 --> 20:34.479
You've been asleep
for almost 24 hours.

20:34.649 --> 20:37.368
And I know you've been up
for almost 24 hours by my side.

20:37.649 --> 20:39.480
I can't tell you how much
that means to me.

20:39.729 --> 20:42.641
Being there for me. Hanging tough.

20:42.809 --> 20:43.924
I wasn't that tough.

20:48.969 --> 20:50.368
You're welcome.

20:50.529 --> 20:53.043
Now, go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:58.849 --> 21:01.124
Okay, spill.

21:01.289 --> 21:02.768
What are you talking about?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.397
- You guys cast a spell, didn't you?
- Who, us?

21:05.569 --> 21:09.278
Yeah, you. Not that I'm not grateful
to be cured, because I am.

21:09.449 --> 21:11.565
But what about that
little personal-gain problem?

21:12.169 --> 21:14.558
Don't you think we would've seen any
consequences by now?

21:14.729 --> 21:16.082
- It's been hours.
- Yeah, maybe

21:16.249 --> 21:18.683
saving a protector of the innocent
isn't really personal gain.

21:19.009 --> 21:20.886
Maybe. Like I said,
I'm not complaining.

21:21.049 --> 21:22.482
I'm just glad you didn't call Leo.

21:23.129 --> 21:25.484
Strange though, with all the demons
we've faced,

21:25.649 --> 21:27.765
this bug, this thing,
was the scariest one of all.

21:27.929 --> 21:30.397
Yeah, you don't have to convince us.

21:32.009 --> 21:35.319
- I love you guys.
- We love you too.

21:35.489 --> 21:37.878
Hey, just don't ever scare us
like that again.

21:38.369 --> 21:39.848
Don't worry.

21:40.329 --> 21:41.648
Oh, my God, I almost forgot.

21:41.809 --> 21:43.925
I have to get that Monet
authenticated by tomorrow.

21:44.089 --> 21:46.808
- At this hour?
- Why not? I'm wide awake.

21:48.609 --> 21:50.486
I guess I should clean up.

22:12.569 --> 22:14.958
- Piper. Piper!
- What?

22:15.889 --> 22:17.527
I think I found a consequence.

22:29.249 --> 22:31.001
Get me Dr. Williamson.

22:34.249 --> 22:35.648
Yeah?

22:36.809 --> 22:39.403
Okay, put them both on Penilovin.
Though I doubt it'll do any good.

22:39.569 --> 22:41.685
Call me if there's any changes. Right.

22:41.849 --> 22:44.363
And what can the Centers
for Disease Control do for you

22:44.529 --> 22:47.089
this fine middle of the night,
Dr. Williamson?

22:47.249 --> 22:49.319
I've really got something
for you this time, Seigler.

22:49.489 --> 22:50.968
I wouldn't have called you
if I didn't.

22:51.129 --> 22:53.802
It's not ethical to get the
government to validate your findings

22:53.969 --> 22:56.767
- just so you can get published.
- This will get me more than published.

22:56.929 --> 22:59.159
I've got an outbreak
of Oroya fever at this hospital.

22:59.729 --> 23:02.197
That's impossible.
Oroya fever isn't contagious.

23:02.369 --> 23:05.167
It is now. I've got three patients
with the disease in isolation.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.287
- How'd they get it?
- I don't know.

23:07.449 --> 23:09.883
But however they did has something
to do with the first patient

23:10.049 --> 23:12.563
that came down with it,
Piper Halliwell.

23:18.209 --> 23:19.688
Morning.

23:21.169 --> 23:22.682
Hey.

23:23.329 --> 23:27.163
- So how's Piper doing?
- Fully recovered.

23:27.329 --> 23:29.285
What? That's great!

23:29.449 --> 23:32.964
Yeah. I just came in early
to confirm a few suspicions.

23:33.129 --> 23:36.041
- Wait, back up, Piper's okay?
- Yes.

23:36.209 --> 23:39.246
She's home, she's healthy,
everything's back to normal.

23:39.409 --> 23:41.286
Jack, we've gotta talk seriously.

23:42.049 --> 23:43.687
Okay, shoot.

23:44.769 --> 23:48.603
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
This thing isn't real.

23:49.129 --> 23:52.360
I mean, I know that it looks perfect
from the outside,

23:52.529 --> 23:54.520
and it makes sense
to just ignore the truth

23:54.689 --> 23:56.998
and pretend that there's
nothing wrong, but I can't do that.

23:58.369 --> 24:01.759
Look, Prue, come on,
I know we've had our difficulties.

24:01.929 --> 24:04.841
And maybe our relationship isn't
everything you hoped for, but...

24:05.009 --> 24:06.124
Jack.

24:06.809 --> 24:08.686
I'm talking about the painting.

24:08.849 --> 24:10.123
It's not real.

24:10.489 --> 24:12.957
I mean, yeah, it's from his school,
but Monet didn't paint it,

24:13.129 --> 24:16.007
- one of his students did.
- Are you sure?

24:17.489 --> 24:19.320
Positive.

24:21.409 --> 24:23.240
So what?

24:23.809 --> 24:25.208
"So what"?

24:25.369 --> 24:27.166
Prue, if someone wants
to believe in something

24:27.329 --> 24:29.968
that may not be altogether true,
but it's true enough for them,

24:30.129 --> 24:32.324
- then what's the harm in letting it be?
- Jack...

24:32.489 --> 24:35.686
Prue, the world is made up
of almost perfect.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.921
It's nothing but near misses
and necessary compromises.

24:39.929 --> 24:43.285
Now, in this case,
I think we got a little bit of both.

24:43.809 --> 24:47.438
But you know what, that's okay.
I know how you feel.

24:47.609 --> 24:50.919
I'm just asking you
to not look so close.

24:51.169 --> 24:53.478
Nothing bears up under
that kind of scrutiny.

24:54.609 --> 24:57.123
Are you talking about the Monet?

24:58.489 --> 25:00.161
Yeah, that too.

25:01.289 --> 25:05.646
Just trust me, all right? Go with it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.441
- Piper Halliwell?
- What's going on?

25:34.609 --> 25:36.327
I'm Dr. Seigler from the CDC.

25:36.529 --> 25:39.168
We have a court order to take you
and your sister into custody.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.127
And to quarantine your club
until further notice.

25:52.329 --> 25:54.889
How many people have been...?

25:55.689 --> 25:59.079
No, I would not classify this
as an epidemic at this stage.

25:59.249 --> 26:02.366
Although that's for Dr. Seigler of
the CDC here to determine, not me.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.402
All I can tell you is that an outbreak
has occurred in the hospital

26:05.569 --> 26:08.288
and we've taken all the necessary
and responsible steps to contain it.

26:08.449 --> 26:11.998
Dr. Williamson, how do you know
it's contained? How can you be sure?

26:12.169 --> 26:14.205
Because we've identified
the initial carrier.

26:14.369 --> 26:16.280
Who is it? What's his name?
Is it a patient?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.838
We've identified the initial carrier
and we've brought her

26:19.009 --> 26:21.807
and anyone she may have infected
down into the isolation ward.

26:21.969 --> 26:24.358
Is it true that they've closed
down a nightclub called P3

26:24.529 --> 26:25.598
because of the outbreak?

26:25.769 --> 26:27.999
That is a question
best answered by Dr. Seigler.

26:28.569 --> 26:30.287
If you'll excuse me.

26:30.649 --> 26:32.401
Yes, I can confirm
that an establishment

26:32.569 --> 26:35.037
by the name of P3
has been quarantined.

26:35.209 --> 26:37.882
But only as
a precautionary measure.

26:39.969 --> 26:42.278
Hello? Hello? Remember us?

26:44.769 --> 26:46.680
I'm sorry, we can't hear you.
What is it you want?

26:46.889 --> 26:49.084
We wanna get the hell out of here,
that's what we want.

26:49.249 --> 26:52.127
Dr. Williamson will be right in
to discuss the situation with you.

26:52.289 --> 26:54.564
Discuss what? I feel fine!

26:54.729 --> 26:56.321
Dr. Williamson will be right in.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.923
This is ridiculous!
Why won't they tell us anything?

26:59.089 --> 27:02.445
They're lucky they're in the other room,
I'd freeze their butts.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.807
Oh, Prue, thank God.

27:04.969 --> 27:06.482
You're obviously not here
to get us out.

27:06.649 --> 27:09.117
No, when I got home, someone
from CDC was waiting for me.

27:09.289 --> 27:11.519
- And they took, like, a quart of blood.
- Ditto.

27:12.009 --> 27:13.601
They might as well
have taken all of mine.

27:13.769 --> 27:16.203
They shut down the club.
They'll ruin it. I'll lose everything.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.724
No, you won't. Once this whole thing
gets straightened out...

27:18.889 --> 27:20.641
I have a feeling
it's not gonna be that easy.

27:20.809 --> 27:22.128
I overheard some doctors talking.

27:22.289 --> 27:24.120
There's others here infected
with the disease.

27:24.289 --> 27:27.281
- But I thought it wasn't contagious.
- Yeah, so did I.

27:29.649 --> 27:33.085
- So can they hear us?
- No.

27:33.649 --> 27:36.402
Did either of you sleep,
by any chance?

27:36.569 --> 27:38.958
Sleep? Piper was bouncing off
the walls last night.

27:39.129 --> 27:42.201
It's gotta be a consequence
of the awakening spell you guys cast.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.361
I have a bad feeling
that's not the only consequence.

28:11.129 --> 28:13.040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28:13.209 --> 28:15.518
- What, no mask?
- No, I don't need it. None of us do.

28:15.689 --> 28:17.964
However the disease
is being spread, it's not airborne.

28:18.129 --> 28:20.484
- I've just ruled that out.
- Great. Then we're free to go.

28:20.649 --> 28:22.685
- Afraid not.
- You can't keep us here.

28:22.849 --> 28:25.158
Actually, I can, by law.
And not just because your sister

28:25.329 --> 28:27.968
circumvented it by opening
the uninspected fruit,

28:28.129 --> 28:29.721
but because she's carrying
a rare disease

28:29.889 --> 28:32.244
that has a possibility of spreading
to epidemic proportions.

28:32.409 --> 28:34.161
I thought that you said
it wasn't contagious.

28:34.329 --> 28:36.240
Oroya fever isn't
supposed to be contagious.

28:36.409 --> 28:38.877
- Well, maybe you misdiagnosed it.
- I didn't.

28:40.049 --> 28:43.041
Aside from the fact that I have no idea
how this disease is being spread,

28:43.209 --> 28:44.767
there's another mystery
concerning me.

28:44.929 --> 28:47.568
Your recovery makes no clinical sense.
Your blood has no antibodies,

28:47.729 --> 28:49.640
which means the immune system
never fought it off.

28:49.809 --> 28:52.277
By all medical standards,
you should be dead right now.

28:52.569 --> 28:55.083
What's the matter, doctor,
you don't believe in miracles?

28:55.249 --> 28:57.683
Not the kind
that don't leave traces, no.

28:59.049 --> 29:01.688
I've got six people infected.
There's nothing I can do to save them

29:01.849 --> 29:03.123
unless I figure out
how you survived.

29:03.289 --> 29:06.247
I'm gonna run a series of tests on
all three of you. Even DNA sampling.

29:06.409 --> 29:08.127
Maybe it's a genetic marker,
I don't know.

29:08.289 --> 29:11.486
But I'm gonna find out. And
you're not gonna leave until I do.

29:16.169 --> 29:18.637
Wow, his bedside manner
sure could use some work.

29:18.809 --> 29:21.369
Six people?
How is that possible?

29:21.929 --> 29:22.918
When we did the spell,

29:23.089 --> 29:25.967
we must have awakened everything
in the room, including the disease.

29:26.129 --> 29:28.848
Is there anything different about
our blood because we're witches?

29:29.369 --> 29:32.520
I don't know, but our first priority is to
figure out how to save these people.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.759
Yeah, but even if we can find
a spell to save them,

29:34.929 --> 29:36.999
how do we prevent it from spreading
to other people?

29:38.409 --> 29:40.479
You have to reverse the spell.

29:40.649 --> 29:42.879
No, Piper, we can't reverse
the spell, because...

29:43.049 --> 29:46.121
You would go back into a coma,
you could die.

29:46.729 --> 29:49.084
I'm not gonna die.
Just reverse the spell

29:49.249 --> 29:51.160
and call Leo so he can heal me.

29:51.849 --> 29:54.682
Leo? I thought you didn't want us
to call Leo.

29:54.849 --> 29:58.285
Well, yeah, that's when I thought
I was sick, not dying.

29:58.449 --> 29:59.882
Piper...

30:00.849 --> 30:03.761
...we already talked to Leo.
He's not allowed to help.

30:07.049 --> 30:09.085
They won't let him.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.123
Great.

30:11.289 --> 30:15.043
Well, thanks for doing something
I specifically asked you not to do.

30:15.209 --> 30:18.360
- Piper, you just said...
- Phoebe, just give it a rest.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.527
Look, Piper, we don't know
the reversal spell anyway.

30:21.689 --> 30:24.442
Yeah, and they won't let us out
of here to go get it.

30:24.609 --> 30:26.440
Prue can get it.

30:26.929 --> 30:28.487
No, I can't.

30:28.649 --> 30:31.959
Okay, I cannot just astrally project
on command. I can't control it like that.

30:32.129 --> 30:35.565
You can learn to control it just like you
learned to control your other power.

30:35.729 --> 30:38.926
- Just concentrate.
- Piper, I can't and I won't.

30:39.249 --> 30:41.638
Prue, you have to try.
We can't let anybody else die.

30:59.809 --> 31:03.358
Take her blood pressure,
get her on FIO2. Let's go, let's go.

31:07.049 --> 31:10.041
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing, she's fine.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.722
Hurry, Prue.

31:15.969 --> 31:19.359
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

31:19.529 --> 31:22.487
Return the disease to whence it came
So life can ease back to the same

31:41.009 --> 31:42.806
Did you see it?

31:43.569 --> 31:46.083
Yeah, Piper, I don't...

31:46.609 --> 31:48.406
Prue, we've already discussed this.

31:48.569 --> 31:50.844
For some reason,
there's no magical out for me.

31:51.009 --> 31:53.682
But there is for the others. Please.

31:55.409 --> 31:59.288
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

32:04.169 --> 32:08.606
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

32:08.769 --> 32:12.887
What was awakened from its sleep
Must once again slumber deep

32:25.449 --> 32:27.599
- Prue! Prue, get help!
- Help!

32:27.769 --> 32:29.248
Piper! Piper!

32:29.409 --> 32:32.481
- Help me get her on the bed.
- Let's go, pick her up.

32:32.649 --> 32:35.288
You girls wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

32:35.769 --> 32:38.442
Get her on the monitor.
Miss Halliwell.

32:38.609 --> 32:41.646
Miss Halliwell.
Miss Halliwell, can you hear me?

32:41.809 --> 32:44.926
Assist in respiration.
Get me a crash cart.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.444
- Starting CPR.
- Her heart rate's erratic.

32:48.409 --> 32:50.639
Get a code team in here stat,
I'm losing her!

32:52.769 --> 32:54.646
Where's the crash cart?

33:14.529 --> 33:16.121
Piper Halliwell, what room is she in?

33:16.289 --> 33:19.087
No, what room is she in, damn it!
I'm family!

33:19.249 --> 33:22.241
Nothing. Draw blood gases,
I need an amp of epinephrine.

33:22.409 --> 33:24.161
- Where's that crash cart?
- It's on its way.

33:24.329 --> 33:26.638
She's not responding to the CPR.

33:28.609 --> 33:31.362
Come on, Miss Halliwell.
Stay with us.

33:33.049 --> 33:34.562
Fourteen gauge.

34:20.889 --> 34:22.402
Leo?

34:22.569 --> 34:25.561
Hurry, take my hands,
we don't have much time.

34:26.089 --> 34:29.126
- Am I dead?
- No, not yet.

34:29.649 --> 34:32.004
Not if you take my hand.

34:32.929 --> 34:36.284
- I don't understand.
- It's the only way I can heal you.

34:36.569 --> 34:40.527
The only chance I have
of them not finding out. Hurry.

34:41.529 --> 34:44.282
- She's in V-fib. Give me the paddles.
- Charging.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.007
- Two hundred joules.
- Two hundred.

34:46.168 --> 34:49.844
On one. Clear. One.

34:50.929 --> 34:52.806
No response.
I'm not getting anything.

34:53.809 --> 34:55.036
- Again.
- Charging!

34:55.208 --> 34:56.641
Clear!

34:59.129 --> 35:01.359
I don't wanna lose you.

35:17.009 --> 35:18.283
Call it.

35:21.049 --> 35:23.358
Time of death, 9:40 a.m.

35:38.049 --> 35:40.199
- Wait.
- EKG's responding.

35:40.489 --> 35:42.400
There's a heartbeat.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.767
Piper?

35:47.929 --> 35:50.523
What the hell? This is incredible.

35:50.809 --> 35:52.561
Leo.

35:55.609 --> 35:57.600
You're all right.

35:57.769 --> 35:59.202
Are you okay?

36:01.089 --> 36:03.398
BP, 105/60, pulse is strong.

36:04.449 --> 36:07.646
- I don't understand. What happened?
- I don't know.

36:08.369 --> 36:10.246
But I'm gonna find out.

36:21.529 --> 36:23.759
Hey, I just heard.
Are you out of your mind?

36:23.929 --> 36:25.123
I don't know, maybe.

36:25.289 --> 36:28.520
Come on, Prue, you can't be serious.
You can't just quit.

36:28.689 --> 36:32.807
I already did. I turned in my
resignation and Caldwell accepted it.

36:32.969 --> 36:36.245
Why? Just because he doesn't agree
with you about selling the Monet?

36:36.409 --> 36:38.718
It's not authentic, Jack.

36:38.889 --> 36:41.483
You know what?
Buyers think it is.

36:41.649 --> 36:44.083
And they've been thinking that way
for over a hundred years.

36:44.249 --> 36:46.717
So it's worth whatever someone's
willing to pay for it, right?

36:47.529 --> 36:49.804
- Yeah, right.
- No, it's wrong.

36:49.969 --> 36:53.200
At least, in my book it is. That's the way
it used to be here before the takeover.

36:53.369 --> 36:57.078
Before everyone cared more about
the sell than what they're selling.

36:57.249 --> 37:00.241
- Including me, right?
- Jack.

37:01.129 --> 37:05.281
It's not just about the painting
or Buckland's new philosophy.

37:05.609 --> 37:08.601
I've been thinking about this
for a while.

37:08.769 --> 37:13.399
A lot has happened to me in the
past year and a half. I've seen...

37:14.489 --> 37:17.845
I've seen things that
I never imagined existed.

37:18.129 --> 37:19.960
And it's changed me.

37:20.969 --> 37:23.119
It's made me wanna make changes.

37:26.089 --> 37:27.886
So, what are you going to do?

37:29.689 --> 37:33.602
I don't know.
Just take some time, figure it out.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.319
Look, I had a little wake-up call,

37:36.489 --> 37:39.049
and I realized that life
is way too short

37:39.209 --> 37:43.441
to be wasting my time doing something
I really don't wanna be doing.

37:43.609 --> 37:46.487
Or being with someone
you really don't wanna be with.

37:47.929 --> 37:50.921
Jack, you have been great.

37:51.529 --> 37:54.248
You've opened me up
to so many new things.

37:55.089 --> 37:57.398
Made me feel wanted again.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.203
But...

38:00.209 --> 38:03.758
But I need to be alone for a while.
No strings.

38:20.169 --> 38:21.682
These haven't been inspected yet.

38:21.849 --> 38:24.522
Put them in the back,
we're returning them to the supplier.

38:24.689 --> 38:26.247
Looks like someone
learned their lesson.

38:26.409 --> 38:28.240
Yeah, the hard way, unfortunately.

38:28.409 --> 38:29.967
Well, still, the club's doing okay.

38:30.129 --> 38:31.960
Doesn't look like quarantine
hurt business much.

38:32.129 --> 38:35.166
Yeah, thanks to no cover charge
and free drinks.

38:36.369 --> 38:39.520
- Have you guys seen Dan around?
- No, why?

38:39.689 --> 38:42.681
No reason, I guess.
I thought he might stop by.

38:43.089 --> 38:46.206
You know, Piper, Dan heard
you call Leo's name

38:46.369 --> 38:48.485
when you were coming around
in the hospital.

38:48.649 --> 38:50.207
He did?

38:50.369 --> 38:52.599
That wasn't me thinking about Leo,
that was just...

38:52.769 --> 38:53.997
Him saving you, I know.

38:54.369 --> 38:56.485
Still, how are you gonna
explain that to Dan?

38:56.849 --> 38:59.727
Well, at least you're alive to try,
that's what's important.

38:59.889 --> 39:03.040
Just because we're witches doesn't
mean we're above the laws of nature.

39:03.209 --> 39:04.403
Or the Wiccan ones.

39:04.569 --> 39:06.480
I know, you don't have
to tell me twice.

39:06.649 --> 39:08.879
I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore.

39:09.329 --> 39:10.842
- Ditto.
- Yeah, Prue,

39:11.009 --> 39:13.239
welcome to the ranks
of the unemployed.

39:13.529 --> 39:16.646
I'm proud of you.
I think what you did was very brave.

39:16.809 --> 39:18.447
Thank you.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.408
Piper.

39:28.129 --> 39:29.323
Leo.

39:29.929 --> 39:32.045
Tell him thanks for us too.

39:37.169 --> 39:39.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:39.729 --> 39:42.004
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

39:42.169 --> 39:44.922
A little tired,
which is actually a good thing.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.518
Leo, thank you for everything you...

39:49.449 --> 39:52.566
- I couldn't let you die, Piper.
- I'm very glad you couldn't.

39:52.729 --> 39:56.961
- Did you get in trouble?
- Yeah, actually, a lot.

39:57.369 --> 39:59.963
They found out what I did.

40:00.129 --> 40:02.484
- They clipped my wings.
- What?

40:02.649 --> 40:06.927
It's not permanent,
it's more like a suspension. I hope.

40:07.089 --> 40:09.967
Leo, I don't know what to say.

40:10.129 --> 40:13.838
You don't have to say anything.
You didn't do anything, I did.

40:14.449 --> 40:18.965
I guess in the back of my head I always
hoped, thought, that someday...

40:19.929 --> 40:22.318
...somehow, you and I would get
a second chance.

40:24.009 --> 40:26.318
- I'm with Dan now, and...
- I know.

40:26.609 --> 40:29.487
And I also know
that now that I'm a mortal...

40:30.129 --> 40:31.528
...l'm gonna fight for you.

40:33.489 --> 40:36.003
May the best man win.
