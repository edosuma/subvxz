02:46.232 --> 02:47.416
Hello?

03:43.625 --> 03:45.333
Who the fuck are you?

03:51.333 --> 03:52.500
Whitey?

03:54.083 --> 03:55.166
Did I come at a bad time?

03:55.565 --> 03:56.791
Who the hell are you?

03:56.875 --> 03:57.916
I'm a friend of Anna's.

03:58.901 --> 04:00.541
Never seen him before in my life.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.375
She's joking.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.291
Looks a bit dodgy to me.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.791
That whole clean-cut,
boy-next-door thing,

04:06.816 --> 04:07.862
I don't buy it.

04:08.612 --> 04:09.791
What do you think, Mum?

04:10.331 --> 04:11.541
The door was open.

04:13.789 --> 04:14.875
Who is he?

04:15.916 --> 04:18.875
His name's Whitey. He saved my life.

04:19.921 --> 04:21.208
What?

04:22.541 --> 04:23.666
Up at the dam. I told you.

04:27.416 --> 04:28.583
I don't care who you are,

04:28.666 --> 04:30.791
you sneak into my house again,
I'll fucking shoot you.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.250
Where's Dad?

04:45.958 --> 04:48.000
Uh, could you give us a moment, please?

05:05.015 --> 05:06.125
Who is he?

05:06.208 --> 05:07.208
Where's Dad?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.416
Can you answer the question?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.291
He's a vac driver.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.041
A what?

05:13.781 --> 05:14.833
Where is he?

05:16.666 --> 05:18.500
I have no idea where your father is.

05:20.763 --> 05:22.000
How'd you meet him?

05:22.716 --> 05:23.875
Told you.

05:24.419 --> 05:25.958
What were you doing up at the dam?

05:26.583 --> 05:27.791
Just exploring.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.250
I thought you'd taken him back.

05:32.761 --> 05:34.041
No.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.125
Then what happened last night?

05:40.666 --> 05:42.625
I don't know yet.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.833
- Stay where I can see you.
- Yeah.

05:53.625 --> 05:54.708
Do you wanna see the river?

05:55.083 --> 05:56.416
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

05:56.546 --> 05:57.666
Whitey.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.833
My family's going through
a hard time right now.

06:04.609 --> 06:05.791
I know.

06:06.958 --> 06:07.958
Anna told me.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.208
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.000
You just be careful
with her, that's all.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.916
I'll take good care of her, Mrs. Worth.

06:23.541 --> 06:24.875
And watch out for bears.

08:17.359 --> 08:18.500
Fuck.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.125
Shut up!

08:46.333 --> 08:47.625
Jesus.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.333
Do you know anything about snakes?

08:55.757 --> 08:56.916
No.

08:58.833 --> 09:01.166
Your mum did say to
look out for bears, though.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.833
They hunt along the edge
of the river, apparently.

09:11.916 --> 09:13.041
Why do you care?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.291
What?

09:17.541 --> 09:21.375
Why do you care whether
I get eaten by bears or not?

09:27.041 --> 09:28.375
I like a girl in wellies.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.125
I mean it. Why...

09:32.958 --> 09:35.416
Why do you care what happens
to me? You barely know me.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I like you.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.583
I shouldn't have said that.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.000
Say something, for fuck's sake.

10:14.958 --> 10:15.958
Um...

10:20.041 --> 10:21.166
Better get back.

10:42.583 --> 10:43.875
What do you want from me?

10:48.208 --> 10:49.208
Nothing.

10:57.601 --> 10:58.708
Wait.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.541
Ah, fucking hell.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.541
What the fuck happened to you?

11:40.875 --> 11:41.916
I got shot.

11:46.549 --> 11:47.708
Wasn't me, was it?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.458
- Biker gang?
- Biker gang...

11:51.416 --> 11:52.708
Robbed a North Stream Oil truck?

11:53.375 --> 11:54.625
Oh, good for them.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.458
I said this town was going to shit.

11:58.625 --> 11:59.958
How's the girls? They all right?

12:00.077 --> 12:01.208
They're fine.

12:01.541 --> 12:02.750
Yeah, I should get over there.

12:04.538 --> 12:05.750
I've run out of toothpaste.

12:06.875 --> 12:07.916
You got any toothpaste?

12:11.416 --> 12:12.625
How about chewing gum?

12:12.708 --> 12:13.750
How about mouthwash?

12:16.413 --> 12:17.666
Smell me.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.625
All right?

12:23.781 --> 12:25.791
- I should probably shower, right?
- Yeah.

12:26.507 --> 12:27.541
All right.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.916
I should go.

12:31.104 --> 12:32.275
No, you stay.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.708
All right?

12:33.875 --> 12:36.250
You go, I'll drink, so...
Tell them I'm on the way.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.000
I don't think it's such
a good idea to go back

12:38.025 --> 12:39.041
to your house right now.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.250
Yeah? Why's that?

12:40.333 --> 12:41.916
On account of what happened?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.166
Which what happened?

12:48.333 --> 12:49.458
Still there?

12:51.416 --> 12:52.708
Yeah, I'm still here, Chief.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.125
Who asked him to chop wood?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.416
He offered.

13:18.541 --> 13:19.625
What's his real name?

13:20.541 --> 13:22.375
Oh, I don't know,
probably something embarrassing.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.041
Yeah, but why Whitey, for God's sakes?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.875
Jesus, Mum, will you leave him alone?

13:29.865 --> 13:31.083
Apparently...

13:32.125 --> 13:34.000
he was the only white kid
in the care home.

13:34.791 --> 13:35.958
He grew up in a care home?

13:36.396 --> 13:37.541
His mum's a drunk.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.625
No wonder you two get along.

13:40.416 --> 13:41.625
She's way worse than Dad.

13:42.077 --> 13:43.166
Is she now?

13:46.208 --> 13:48.083
Whitey spends all his money
on a nursing home.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.541
He hasn't given up on her.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.625
You think I've given up
on your father, is that it?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.083
You kicked him out.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.375
Of course I kicked him out.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.875
He slept with another woman.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.416
And do you think that's okay?

14:04.041 --> 14:06.416
Your father kicked our
front door in last night.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.958
He was smashed, reeking of whiskey

14:10.041 --> 14:11.416
and covered in blood.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.458
And how did that make you feel?

14:13.541 --> 14:15.166
I don't know, Mum.
I don't know what to feel.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.125
There are so many things
you're not telling me.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.541
Why are you carrying a gun around?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.333
Why was there a fucking
snake in the house?

14:20.416 --> 14:21.875
Whose blood was Dad covered in?

14:21.958 --> 14:23.916
- Anna...
- I'm not a kid anymore!

14:27.625 --> 14:28.708
I held him...

14:29.750 --> 14:32.500
just after he'd been shot in the head.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.666
My little brother, I held him.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.458
Oh, my God.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.583
What has Dad done?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.208
I honestly don't know.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.125
Yes?

16:18.666 --> 16:19.708
May I speak with you?

16:19.791 --> 16:20.875
Yes.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.166
Is this an inconvenient time?

16:23.625 --> 16:24.625
Yes.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.500
Well, I'm sorry,
but I need to talk to you.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.125
How can I help you?

16:44.622 --> 16:45.833
You hunt.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.208
A man of many hobbies, I see.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.500
And most of them are private.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.500
Excuse me.

17:00.041 --> 17:02.416
Why is a multi-
billion-dollar corporation

17:02.500 --> 17:04.958
worried about what
a small-town cop has to say?

17:06.665 --> 17:08.040
Nobody else is.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.833
He has zero credibility.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.125
I checked with legal,
they're not driving it.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.500
And it's not coming from the
top floor, so it must be you.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.040
ELIZABETH You're the Head of Security,

17:19.125 --> 17:21.500
you're supposed to be running
a zero-tolerance policy

17:21.583 --> 17:23.875
on drugs, gambling, prostitution.

17:23.958 --> 17:25.625
You're not watching our employees,

17:25.708 --> 17:26.915
you're watching the Police Chief.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.875
Why are you so worried about him?

17:30.666 --> 17:32.708
What has he done that you task me

17:32.791 --> 17:34.791
with destroying his career
and his family?

17:42.541 --> 17:44.000
My job is...

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
all I have.

17:47.615 --> 17:48.833
And...

17:49.958 --> 17:51.166
in my...

17:52.541 --> 17:55.208
all-consuming pursuit of high standards,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.625
sometimes I overstep the mark.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.708
And I have made you feel, uh...

18:05.666 --> 18:06.916
uncomfortable.

18:10.791 --> 18:11.833
I apologize.

18:16.958 --> 18:18.333
You apologize to me?

18:19.232 --> 18:20.375
Yes.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.291
Don't try and do my job,
Monsieur Gagnon.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.500
Your job?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.416
Intimidation, you are good at.

18:30.666 --> 18:32.708
Making friends, you are not.

18:35.416 --> 18:37.833
You could've leveled with me,
but you didn't.

18:40.791 --> 18:41.791
Remember that.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.891
If you don't lay off the booze

18:59.916 --> 19:01.625
they're gonna take your gun
and your star.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.833
Fuck 'em.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.208
I mean, seriously, fuck 'em.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.208
You know what?

19:08.708 --> 19:11.291
They can't suspend me
if I chuck it in, right?

19:11.375 --> 19:13.128
I liked the gun, but
I didn't much care for the star.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.166
Here you are. You have it.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.000
You'd make a much better chief
than me, Chief.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.666
Why are you doing this?

19:17.831 --> 19:18.898
My family's not safe.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.333
Whoever tried to kill me
is gonna have another go, so...

19:22.250 --> 19:23.750
I'm gonna round up the girls
and get out of here.

19:24.916 --> 19:26.125
- You're quitting?
- Yep.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.208
Can we at least talk about this?

19:28.291 --> 19:29.333
We did.

19:29.708 --> 19:31.041
I can't fucking believe this.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.318
Just drive on.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
So, gonna get you to fill
the rest of this out.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.541
Thank you.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.708
Back in your box.

19:48.625 --> 19:49.791
You can't be too careful,

19:50.125 --> 19:51.250
so...

19:52.583 --> 19:53.916
Might have to shoot my way out.

19:55.666 --> 19:56.833
- What's his name again?
- McGillen.

19:56.858 --> 19:57.875
Yeah.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.458
McGillen!

20:05.624 --> 20:06.958
Yes?

20:07.041 --> 20:08.958
Book me three one-way tickets to London.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.583
Sorry?

20:12.333 --> 20:13.458
Uh, make it Florida.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.291
Oh, hang on, I've got
a warrant out in Florida.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.208
Just get us to London.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.041
Right? We'll work it out
when we get there.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.833
First I'm a pharmacist,
now I'm a travel agent.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.666
Shouldn't you be looking for a witness?

20:29.458 --> 20:30.958
Jaclyn Letendre is still missing.

20:31.171 --> 20:33.833
If you walk out that door,
I might not be here when you get back.

20:33.916 --> 20:34.916
Grow up.

20:37.541 --> 20:38.833
First I'm a pharmacist,

20:38.916 --> 20:40.000
now I'm a travel agent.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.750
Shouldn't you be looking for a witness?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.333
Jaclyn Letendre is still missing.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.458
<i>You walk out that door,
I might not be here when you get back.</i>

20:51.083 --> 20:53.000
<i>Jaclyn Letendre is still missing.</i>

21:18.570 --> 21:19.666
Leave it.

21:20.666 --> 21:22.041
I can't leave it, okay?

21:22.125 --> 21:24.458
You may have given up
on this town, but I haven't.

21:24.541 --> 21:26.875
Well, you've got one arm
and I'm in no fit state, so...

21:28.375 --> 21:29.708
Is that the fellow that shot you?

21:30.041 --> 21:31.916
I can't believe you're gonna
leave me here with this shit!

21:32.000 --> 21:33.958
Yeah, well, McGillen will be
off monitor duty soon,

21:34.041 --> 21:35.333
so you'll be using him
as a human shield.

21:35.416 --> 21:38.208
This isn't a joke, okay?
There's only two of us. We need you.

21:38.702 --> 21:39.833
You'll be fine.

21:41.416 --> 21:42.791
You're a good cop.

21:45.877 --> 21:47.041
Drive on.

21:51.416 --> 21:52.958
Oh! That's one less to worry about.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.750
Looks like the Chief's not up for it.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.000
There goes the neighborhood.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.088
Mm-hmm.

22:07.875 --> 22:08.958
<i>Have you done it yet?</i>

22:09.708 --> 22:10.833
There's too many cameras.

22:10.916 --> 22:13.291
Then, for fuck's sake, get out
of there while you still can.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.166
Stop telling me what to do, Frank.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.666
I'm in charge.

22:16.691 --> 22:17.818
In charge of what?

22:18.208 --> 22:20.125
If you wanted them dead,
they'd be dead by now.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.250
What's your point?

22:21.875 --> 22:22.916
The girl.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.541
What about the girl?

22:25.625 --> 22:26.708
You're smitten, Whitey.

22:26.733 --> 22:27.916
I'm not a fool.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
<i>You've been hanging around her</i>

22:29.083 --> 22:30.333
<i>like a bad smell for 10 days.</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:33.208
That girl is a frigid bitch, Frank.

22:46.841 --> 22:48.083
Pussy.

22:49.482 --> 22:52.000
You fucking pussy.

23:13.833 --> 23:14.833
Come on.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.166
Mmm.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.208
Okay.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.291
Ah, fuck.

23:55.625 --> 23:58.250
Whitey!

23:58.791 --> 24:00.291
Mum, you okay?

24:00.375 --> 24:01.666
Mum, look at me.

24:02.833 --> 24:03.833
Whitey!

24:04.500 --> 24:05.541
Whitey, come here!

24:05.721 --> 24:06.791
Mum.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.583
What do I do? What do...

24:10.083 --> 24:11.333
I don't know what's wrong.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.083
- Pills, does she take any?
- Yes, she takes loads.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.375
Go get them, I'll stay with her.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.958
It's okay, it's okay.

24:30.208 --> 24:32.208
I'm sorry for what happened, Mrs. Worth.

24:33.666 --> 24:35.708
No mum should have to
lose her little boy.

24:39.708 --> 24:40.875
It'll be all right.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.458
It'll be all right.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.458
Thanks, Whitey.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.125
Thank you.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.166
I'm sorry for...

25:33.333 --> 25:34.750
freaking out before.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.000
You've been really kind.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.375
I just...

25:52.000 --> 25:53.708
I just think it's sad, that's all.

25:56.682 --> 25:57.875
That you both

25:58.682 --> 25:59.875
gotta go through all this

26:01.237 --> 26:02.333
alone.

26:10.299 --> 26:11.375
<i>Frank.</i>

26:11.458 --> 26:13.416
- Sweetheart.
<i>- Where the fuck are you?</i>

26:14.940 --> 26:16.250
Taking care of business.

26:16.333 --> 26:17.583
What business?

26:19.333 --> 26:21.208
Just that little family matter
I was telling you about.

26:21.233 --> 26:22.312
A debt of honor.

26:22.429 --> 26:24.375
- I won't be long now.
- Well, you best not be

26:24.458 --> 26:25.916
because there's a bunch
of strippers here

26:25.941 --> 26:26.958
<i>waiting to audition.</i>

26:26.983 --> 26:28.833
<i>Okay? I need a man's opinion on this.</i>

26:29.671 --> 26:30.833
I'll call you back, love.

26:35.045 --> 26:36.125
Fuck!

26:37.795 --> 26:38.958
Fuck, fuck!

26:55.802 --> 26:56.916
<i>He's coming.</i>

26:58.239 --> 26:59.330
So?

27:00.075 --> 27:01.375
<i>He's minutes away, Whitey.</i>

27:01.458 --> 27:02.875
Get the fuck out of there now!

27:04.208 --> 27:05.458
No, I'm not finished yet.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.333
I'm considering filing a complaint

27:17.416 --> 27:19.000
against one of our employees.

27:19.458 --> 27:20.500
What sort?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.208
Sexist comments.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.375
Surely not. In this business?

27:26.583 --> 27:28.541
Which chauvinist, redneck pig
do I have the pleasure

27:28.625 --> 27:30.000
of assisting you in taking down?

27:32.083 --> 27:33.333
I need some background first.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.125
If he'd done it before,
it would make a big difference.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.666
You got it.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.875
All right, love?

27:50.958 --> 27:52.083
Mum's cooking.

27:52.208 --> 27:53.333
Oh, fuck me, really?

27:54.958 --> 27:56.166
Pack your bags, we're going to London.

27:56.791 --> 27:58.500
- What?
- It's what you wanted, isn't it?

27:58.583 --> 27:59.583
I'm cooking dinner.

27:59.666 --> 28:01.958
Jesus Christ, all the more
reason to leave, isn't it?

28:02.041 --> 28:04.041
Shite. Anna, could you give me
a hand here?

28:04.125 --> 28:05.375
I've connected up
the new gas cylinder...

28:05.400 --> 28:06.416
- Dad!
- No!

28:06.500 --> 28:07.541
Who the fuck are you?

28:07.625 --> 28:08.916
He was with me at the dam.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.833
This is Whitey,
he's been helping us out today.

28:13.174 --> 28:14.333
Jim.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.375
Is there anything else I can help with?

28:24.125 --> 28:26.750
Uh, no, shit, this is nearly ready.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.250
Boyfriend material?

28:28.666 --> 28:30.333
- Ah, Jesus, Jim.
- Dad.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Get upstairs.

28:32.125 --> 28:33.708
Oi, teen sex, don't you fucking move.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.458
You, stay where you are.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.000
Well, that went well.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.541
So you're staying for dinner, then.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.583
Really? Do I have to?

28:51.625 --> 28:54.125
College, military school, navy,

28:54.208 --> 28:55.833
special forces, CSIS,

28:55.916 --> 28:57.958
and then Operations
and Security for North Stream.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.708
Nothing out of the ordinary.

28:59.791 --> 29:00.791
Spotless, in fact.

29:01.846 --> 29:03.000
Except for one thing.

29:03.198 --> 29:04.333
What?

29:04.708 --> 29:06.041
There's not much on it in HR,

29:06.125 --> 29:08.291
but apparently Mr. Gagnon
had some sort of run in

29:08.375 --> 29:11.166
with a small First Nations
police service up in...

29:12.396 --> 29:13.500
Reverie.

29:14.458 --> 29:15.458
Reverie?

29:15.541 --> 29:17.208
Yeah, it's like
700 clicks north of here,

29:17.291 --> 29:18.750
way up in the bundocks.

29:18.833 --> 29:20.083
Bundocks? You mean boondocks?

29:20.666 --> 29:21.833
Technically, it's bundocks.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.125
Point is, there's absolutely
nothing up there.

29:31.195 --> 29:32.458
What is that?

29:33.491 --> 29:34.708
Duck...

29:35.166 --> 29:37.708
in burned orange sauce.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.250
Careful of the lead pellets.

29:39.921 --> 29:41.041
You shot it?

29:41.305 --> 29:42.500
Yes, I did.

29:43.329 --> 29:44.541
Well, I'm not eating it.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.250
Why not?

29:46.541 --> 29:47.750
It's probably contaminated.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.000
Well, it was perfectly
healthy when I shot it.

29:50.416 --> 29:51.666
How do you know? You're not a vet.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.750
Well, neither are you.

29:55.526 --> 29:56.708
Mmm.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.958
It's delicious, Mrs. Worth.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.041
Mmm. ANGELA: Thank you.

30:01.833 --> 30:02.958
Your mum's an amazing cook.

30:04.869 --> 30:06.000
Really?

30:08.390 --> 30:09.625
Yeah.

30:20.435 --> 30:21.541
Here you are then.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.958
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is a family dinner,

30:44.250 --> 30:46.125
and we have private matters to discuss,

30:46.208 --> 30:47.375
so if you wouldn't mind...

30:47.827 --> 30:49.041
Mind what?

30:49.281 --> 30:50.416
Fucking off.

31:26.708 --> 31:28.750
- Whitey, he didn't mean it.
- Of course he did.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.250
I don't blame him, I don't belong here.

31:30.275 --> 31:31.433
Wait.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.041
You had no right to behave like that.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.291
- I don't like the look of him.
- Tsk.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.833
You lost the right to dictate who does

31:43.916 --> 31:45.375
or who doesn't sit at this table

31:45.958 --> 31:48.500
when you fucked another
woman while I was in a coma.

31:51.483 --> 31:52.541
You know...

31:53.208 --> 31:56.583
that boy has been more help
to Anna since Petey's death

31:57.083 --> 31:58.416
than either you or I have,

31:58.791 --> 32:00.458
so if anyone's gonna fuck off, it's you.

32:00.541 --> 32:01.583
Back to your hotel.

32:12.958 --> 32:13.958
What did you do that for?

32:15.083 --> 32:16.250
Do I have to have a reason?

36:17.708 --> 36:19.041
Hello, Jack.

36:43.666 --> 36:46.125
I want you to kill the men
who murdered my son.

Fuck.

All right?

40:01.695 --> 40:02.916
And what's that?

40:03.708 --> 40:05.958
- Armadillo, need a rest?
- Fuck off!

40:06.041 --> 40:07.166
Hey, old man?

40:07.250 --> 40:08.291
Get up, osti.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.166
Get up.

40:58.452 --> 40:59.666
Ah, osti.

41:03.835 --> 41:05.000
Here.

41:05.312 --> 41:06.416
Whatever.

41:07.913 --> 41:09.125
You all right?

41:18.400 --> 41:19.445
Here you are.

41:29.838 --> 41:31.000
Did you hire him?

41:32.458 --> 41:34.583
If I hired him, you'd be dead.

41:37.583 --> 41:40.500
Maybe he took a job with
North Stream as a cover story.

41:41.669 --> 41:42.833
Why?

41:45.791 --> 41:47.750
Seem to me a man like you

41:47.833 --> 41:49.458
would know exactly why.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.500
A man like me?

41:53.208 --> 41:55.791
A man like you, you find it
difficult to reintegrate

41:55.875 --> 41:57.125
back into normal duty.

41:57.958 --> 42:00.208
A man like you is used to
working his own hours,

42:00.291 --> 42:01.458
being his own boss and...

42:02.333 --> 42:03.833
ignoring the rules.

42:04.375 --> 42:05.541
The fuck you talking about?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.708
Are you settling back
into normal police work?

42:10.833 --> 42:12.833
The required shedding of old habits?

42:16.208 --> 42:17.500
A man like you,

42:18.291 --> 42:21.333
he may feel uncomfortable,
so he takes a...

42:22.208 --> 42:26.000
cynical, suspicious, or even
paranoiac world view.

42:26.916 --> 42:28.125
A man like you,

42:29.416 --> 42:31.500
he feels constantly on guard.

42:34.874 --> 42:36.125
You lost me.

42:37.343 --> 42:38.458
Cochon.

42:39.791 --> 42:41.083
Pig in a blanket,

42:41.958 --> 42:45.083
Mr, uh, Devlin?

42:49.791 --> 42:51.666
So I did a bit of plain clothes work.

42:52.007 --> 42:53.250
A bit?

42:53.500 --> 42:56.833
You did 10 years working
undercover with an SO10

42:56.916 --> 42:59.250
and another six with the
Specialist Crime Directorate.

43:01.916 --> 43:03.458
You're an undercover cop.

43:09.041 --> 43:10.916
Men like you, they make enemies.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.000
You got careless.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.083
Fucked a lot of people.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.416
How'd you find out?

43:24.958 --> 43:26.333
I read your file.

43:26.458 --> 43:27.458
Bollocks.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.833
No one below a senior DCI can
get their hands on that file.

43:31.916 --> 43:33.291
Not even me. It's classified.

43:35.458 --> 43:36.583
It made for...

43:37.000 --> 43:38.500
for some good reading, you know.

43:39.625 --> 43:41.166
Couldn't put it down.

43:41.666 --> 43:43.208
But then you'd know that, huh?

43:44.916 --> 43:46.166
I mean, a man like you,

43:47.041 --> 43:49.291
he must know what is in his own file.

43:49.791 --> 43:50.916
You lived it.

43:51.791 --> 43:52.708
Unless, of course,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
you were too busy screwing around

43:56.083 --> 43:58.708
with drug and alcohol to remember

44:00.333 --> 44:01.208
who...

44:02.208 --> 44:03.166
you...

44:04.333 --> 44:05.458
fucked.

44:20.041 --> 44:21.416
Sniffing around the girl.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.666
What the fuck for?

44:22.750 --> 44:25.833
I don't give a shit
about the fucking girl, Frank!

44:26.458 --> 44:28.666
I just need her to think I do.

44:28.691 --> 44:29.708
Why?

44:30.041 --> 44:33.208
So that I can do to Jack Devlin
what he did to my mum.

44:36.750 --> 44:37.833
I want no part of it.

44:41.416 --> 44:43.000
You think you can walk out on me?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.625
Oh, I should've walked out
on you two weeks ago

44:45.708 --> 44:47.000
when you shot that little boy.

44:51.750 --> 44:53.041
I'm loyal to you, Whitey,

44:54.249 --> 44:55.333
and your mum.

44:55.916 --> 44:56.958
I loved her.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.208
But I can't go on like this.

45:06.583 --> 45:07.625
I'm finished.

45:09.380 --> 45:11.000
It's over, Whitey.

45:14.747 --> 45:16.083
You're on your own.

45:17.305 --> 45:23.683
