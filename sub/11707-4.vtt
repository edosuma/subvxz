09:06.128 --> 09:07.380
{\an8}I just love role playing.

Alright. My bazooka's out.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.260

Excuse me!

09:12.343 --> 09:14.220
{\an1}Oh, my God!
No manners over here!

09:14.303 --> 09:17.974
{\an1}- No, never. No shame.
- It smells phenomenal in here.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.226
Oh, it's gorgeous.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.269
{\an1}<i>(Mike D)</i>
<i>The girls with their hats</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:22.728

the Kentucky Derby

09:24.105 --> 09:25.648
It's Flo and Nancy time.

- Are there lemons over there?

They're right here.

{\an1}No, wait, these aren't lemons,
these are melons.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.825
Another Sunday dinner.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.251
{\an1}<i>(Pauly D)</i>

{\an8}Awkward, weird.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.560
[burps]

10:03.352 --> 10:04.520
That girl, Erica, called before

10:04.603 --> 10:05.521
{\an1}but I didn't know who
she's calling for, Vinny or you.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.940
{\an1}I didn't know
who she was calling for.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.859
[laughing]

10:09.942 --> 10:12.611
{\an1}I don't know. We heard
you were moaning all night.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.405
She didn't [bleep] down there.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.575
{\an1}She went to, and then I decided
I didn't want to do that.

10:17.658 --> 10:22.413
{\an1}Now, I realize
I was a little bi-curious.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.957
And I've realized
I do like boys.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.375
{\an1}I always said
if I was to ever be bi-curious

10:26.459 --> 10:29.879
{\an1}it would be with a hot blonde.
I thought she was adorable.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.714
How did you like her, Vin?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.049
- 'Oh.'
- 'Wow!'

10:33.132 --> 10:35.259
{\an1}She jumped out of Vin's bed
to go into your bed

10:35.343 --> 10:37.553
or you went and got her?

10:37.636 --> 10:38.763
- I got her.
- You <i> rapina'd.</i>

10:38.846 --> 10:40.848
{\an1}- You did the robbery.
-<i> Rapina.</i>

10:40.931 --> 10:43.309
{\an4}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>Deena has a criminal record</i>
<i>of [bleep] blocking now.</i>

10:43.392 --> 10:45.686
{\an8}This is a serious offense

10:45.770 --> 10:47.730
{\an7}and it's gonna be on her record
for at least seven years.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.273
{\an1}I don't think there's anything
wrong with girls kissing

10:49.357 --> 10:51.525
each other, but I do think it's
wrong what happened last night.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.985
Who are you to judge?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.488
{\an1}If somebody's in somebody's bed,
you don't go and grab them

10:55.571 --> 10:57.406
{\an1}you know what I mean?
That's just proper etiquette.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.658
You've done the robbery
on Vinny so many times.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.244
{\an1}- No, I've never had a robbery--
- 'Ooh!'

11:02.328 --> 11:05.414
Busted! Big time! Yep!

11:05.498 --> 11:06.916
We just hate [bleep] blockers...

11:06.999 --> 11:09.251
'I'm not a [bleep] blocker,
and I gave her back after.'

11:09.335 --> 11:10.836
Next time, like,
I might like the girl

11:10.920 --> 11:13.255
{\an1}so don't, like, just lift up
the covers and take her.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.715
{\an1}- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.599

- That's pretty much it.

{\an1}I thought my relationship
with the boys was different

11:48.207 --> 11:49.375
but clearly, it's not.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.627
To them, you crossed the line

11:51.710 --> 11:53.212
when you hooked up
with that chick.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.297
{\an1}And to them,
it was [bleep] blocking.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.882

You coming to bed?

35:22.036 --> 35:24.539
I'm not coming to bed. Come on.

35:27.708 --> 35:28.918
{\an7}I hate when girls waste
my time and don't wanna deal.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.546
Are you gonna lay down or not?

35:31.629 --> 35:34.048
{\an1}I mean,
I don't wanna lay down yet.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.424
It's so early.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.261
- No problem.<i> Ciao.</i>
-<i> Ciao.</i>

35:38.344 --> 35:39.595
{\an7}It's 4:00 in the morning,
why the [bleep] are you coming

35:39.679 --> 35:42.390
{\an7}back to my house, if they're
not trying to get it in?

35:42.473 --> 35:44.058
[knock on door]

35:44.141 --> 35:44.809
Let me put that in my bag.

35:44.892 --> 35:47.311
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.356
{\an1}...unless you wanna stay here.
I can go by myself.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.279
- No, no, like...
- I just got to go.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.155
{\an5}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>No matter how hard</i>
<i>I try right now</i>

35:58.239 --> 35:59.240
{\an7}Pauly's girl's definitely
[bleep] blocking

35:59.323 --> 36:01.784
{\an7}and she's gonna leave
no matter what.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.244
- Bye, gorgeouses.
- Bye.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.453
Get home safe.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.372
{\an7}But you know what,
I always got a back-up plan

36:06.455 --> 36:09.125
{\an8}on my back up plan,
so I called Britney.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.126
(Britney)
'Hello?'

36:10.209 --> 36:11.836
Come see me for an hour or two?

36:11.919 --> 36:15.006
- 'Why not.'
- Bam.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.468
{\an1}- Are you okay? You alright?
- Yeah.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.053
I got, uh, Britney coming up.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.847
I'm just gonna go
in the smash room.

36:22.930 --> 36:23.931
It's all you, bro.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.266
It's none of my business

36:25.349 --> 36:26.475
but you both love each other

36:26.559 --> 36:28.185
at the end of the day.
So just know that.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.312
At the end of the day.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.148
{\an1}At the end of the day,
you both do.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.441
{\an1}- 'That's all I'm saying.'
- It's bull[bleep].

36:33.524 --> 36:35.526
{\an1}- Can I lay right here?
- No, you can sit up. It's fine.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.777
I don't really feel like that.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.446
{\an1}'Alright, you lay down
and I'll sit up.'

36:38.529 --> 36:40.990
{\an1}- Okay. Can I use your blanket?
- Okay.

36:41.073 --> 36:43.409
{\an1}- Do what you gotta do.
- Thanks.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.495
So we're not friends anyway?

36:46.579 --> 36:48.873
{\an1}- I gotta live with you.
- That's it?

36:48.956 --> 36:51.792
{\an1}That's what it is.
It's what it's gotta be.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.544
{\an1}'Cause I make mistakes,
and you make mistakes

36:53.628 --> 36:55.880
{\an1}like *** Mike told me,
the *** brats

36:55.963 --> 36:57.882
are *** *** his mouth.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.216
"Ron said he's *** bringing home

36:59.300 --> 37:00.801
*** five *** girls."

37:00.885 --> 37:02.219
He's got girls on his way."

37:02.303 --> 37:03.804
{\an1}I didn't wanna say anything,
'cause he was drunk

37:03.888 --> 37:05.056
{\an1}but Ronnie was like,
"I got, like, five girls

37:05.139 --> 37:07.099
coming to the house right now."

37:07.183 --> 37:09.685
And I was like,
"Alright," you know.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.811
{\an5}(Sam)
'And you know
what I [bleep] did?'

37:10.895 --> 37:12.605
{\an1}'I brushed it off
my [bleep] shoulders'

37:12.688 --> 37:15.066
{\an1}'cause I don't give a [bleep]
what anybody has to say

37:15.149 --> 37:16.651
{\an1}or what you have to say
when you're drunk.

37:16.734 --> 37:17.985
And you know what, I'm sorry.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.487
{\an8}That's what he ***
said to me actually.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.239
{\an1}Ask-ask Jenni, ask anybody.
He said it to me.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.330
I know you do.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.958
I know you do.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.000
"Mike said?"

37:33.084 --> 37:35.294
This is [bleep]
is [bleep] amazing.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.302
{\an7}At this point,
I'm [bleep] done with Mike.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.182
{\an7}So now it's time for me
to put him in his [bleep] place.

37:48.265 --> 37:51.018
Now [bleep] about to go down.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.895
I'm gonna [bleep] him up.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.313
{\an1}Wake the *** up.
Now you wanna be a bitch?

37:54.397 --> 37:56.524
You *** tellin' my girlfriend

37:56.607 --> 37:59.026
{\an1}that I have girls,
like, on the way if I want to?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.361
{\an1}- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.612
Get the [bleep] up, bro

38:01.696 --> 38:02.321
'cause now I'm gonna
flip the [bleep] out.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.120
{\an1}Mike told me, "Ron said
he's got girls on his way."

38:09.203 --> 38:10.288
"Mike said?"
Wake the [bleep] up.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.248
{\an1}You [bleep]
tellin' my girlfriend

38:12.331 --> 38:14.417
{\an1}that I have girls
on the way if I want to?

38:14.500 --> 38:17.044
{\an5}(Ronnie)
'Now the [bleep]
about to go down.'

38:17.128 --> 38:18.546
I gonna [bleep] him up.'

38:18.629 --> 38:21.799
{\an1}'Wake the [bleep] up.
Now you wanna be a bitch?'

38:21.882 --> 38:23.634
{\an1}- Get the [bleep] up, bro.
- What are you talking about?

38:23.718 --> 38:24.719
{\an1}'You're such
a [bleep] tough guy.'

38:24.802 --> 38:26.929
{\an1}You're always [bleep]
talking [bleep] about me

38:27.013 --> 38:28.055
behind my [bleep] back
when it comes to Sam.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.017
What are you talking about?

38:31.100 --> 38:34.478
{\an4}(Ronnie)
''Cause now I'm done playing
this [bleep] bull[bleep] now.'

38:34.562 --> 38:36.188
{\an7}I hear screaming, and it's
like Ron and Sam bull[bleep]

38:36.272 --> 38:37.565
{\an7}so I'm like,
"Ugh, goin' back to bed.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.608
{\an1}<i>I don't feel</i>
<i>like dealing with this."</i>

38:39.692 --> 38:40.693
{\an1}Tell him what
the [bleep] you told me

38:40.776 --> 38:42.945
'cause now [bleep]
about to go down.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.739
Go tell him
what the [bleep] told me.

38:44.822 --> 38:45.948
Go tell him what you,
I'm gonna [bleep] him up

38:46.032 --> 38:48.993
if you don't tell him. Tell him.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.077
I haven't spoken
with you in a year.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.996
{\an1}Yeah, tell him what
the [bleep] you told me.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.414
{\an1}Tell him what the [bleep]
you told me.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.915
{\an1}Remember when
we went out to the cafe

38:54.999 --> 38:56.876
{\an1}you're like, "Ron said
he brought home five girls?

38:56.959 --> 38:58.502
He's got girls coming over."

38:58.586 --> 39:00.004
{\an1}- Don't lie.
- Wait, wait, what happen?

39:00.087 --> 39:02.590
{\an1}You're like, "Ron said he's
gonna bring home girls tonight."

39:02.673 --> 39:04.759
'Remember you said that?'

39:04.842 --> 39:06.677
{\an1}I didn't wanna say anything,
'cause he was drunk

39:06.761 --> 39:08.554
{\an1}but Ronnie was like,
"I got, like, five girls

39:08.637 --> 39:10.973
coming to the house right now."

39:11.057 --> 39:13.267
{\an1}- Remember you said that?
- No.

39:13.350 --> 39:15.102
{\an1}- 'No? You don't remember that?'
- No.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.604
{\an1}- 'Cause I made that up?
- You don't remember that?

39:16.687 --> 39:19.440
{\an1}- No.
- Why would I make that up?

39:19.523 --> 39:22.276
{\an1}You don't remember that?
You know what?

39:22.359 --> 39:24.945
Now you can [bleep]
take your [bleep]

39:25.029 --> 39:26.322
and get the [bleep] out, bro.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.282
{\an1}- Ron.
- Get the [bleep] out, bro.

39:28.365 --> 39:29.950
{\an1}- Stop, Ron!
- 'Get the [bleep] out, bro.'

39:30.034 --> 39:31.035
{\an4}<i>(Jenni)</i>
<i>I'm like, "Oh, great,</i>
<i>Ron and Sam [bleep]."</i>

39:31.118 --> 39:34.205
{\an7}- But then I hear Mike.
- Ron.

39:34.288 --> 39:35.915
{\an7}You ain't [bleep] welcome
in this room, bro.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.083
And I'm like, "Uh-oh."

39:37.166 --> 39:39.585
{\an8}Ron, I don't get involved in...

39:39.668 --> 39:41.712
{\an7}I don't get involved
in your relationship, Ron.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.963
{\an8}- Please.
- Stop!

39:43.047 --> 39:45.174
{\an7}Please don't be
irrational right now, Ron.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.509
{\an7}- [bleep]
- 'Yo, I don't get...'

39:46.592 --> 39:48.135
{\an7}'I don't get [bleep] involved

39:48.219 --> 39:49.678
{\an8}Don't *** get loud with me, bro.

{\an8}I [bleep] stay away

39:58.062 --> 39:59.230
{\an7}- Yeah?

39:59.313 --> 40:02.274
{\an7}You wanna hit me?
You wanna hit me, tough guy?

40:02.358 --> 40:03.859
You wanna *** do it?

40:03.943 --> 40:05.361
You wanna throw my [bleep] bed?

40:05.444 --> 40:07.822
{\an1}You wanna throw
my [bleep] bed? Come on!

40:07.905 --> 40:08.948
You wanna do this?
