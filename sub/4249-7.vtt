SOPHISTICATED, INTELLIGENT,
MANNERED.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.507
- ALREADY OVER ME THEN.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.510
- UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US
ONE MOMENT, VICTOR.

10:36.594 --> 10:41.057
TRUDY, LET'S GET THAT BOX
OVER TO THE WEST CORNER.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.350
- OF COURSE, JASPER.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.463
- I'M IN.

11:14.298 --> 11:18.386
- [sighs]

11:18.469 --> 11:21.180
- THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.933
I WONDER HOW FAR IT GOES.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.768
UM...

11:29.688 --> 11:30.564
- [sighs]

11:30.648 --> 11:32.108
SO WE'VE GOT A DOOR BUT NO KEY

11:32.191 --> 11:33.317
AND A PEDASTAL
WITH NOTHING ON IT.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.611
- AND A BOOKCASE FULL OF BOOKS.

11:35.694 --> 11:38.072
NOW WHAT?

11:38.155 --> 11:39.281
- THE BOOKCASE
IS MARKED WITH THOTH,

11:39.365 --> 11:42.326
THE GOD OF KNOWLEDGE.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.830
AND WE GET KNOWLEDGE FROM BOOKS.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.872
- LOOK AT THIS.

11:46.956 --> 11:51.585
R-E-B-T-R-O.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.629
REBTRO.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.089
- I DON'T GET IT.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.340
- IT'S AN ANAGRAM...

11:56.424 --> 11:57.550
FOR ROBERT.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.514
[clicking]

12:03.597 --> 12:06.642
[loud rumbling]

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
SO IT'S NOT WHAT'S IN THE BOOKS.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.983
IT'S WHAT'S ON THEM.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.484
WE NEED TO SPELL HIS FULL NAME.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.404
- AND "ROBERT FROBISHER-SMYTHE"
IS DEFINITELY A FULL NAME.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.738
[clattering]

12:31.167 --> 12:32.460
- OKAY.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.211
SO WE'RE JUST MISSING
"FROBISHER."

12:34.295 --> 12:35.504
THAT'S NINE BOOKS MISSING.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.505
WHERE COULD THEY BE?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.215
- FROBISHER LIBRARY?

12:38.299 --> 12:41.010
- OKAY.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.511
LET'S NAIL THIS SPELLING BEE.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.390
[creaking and rumbling]

12:51.020 --> 12:52.438
- OH, NO, WE'RE LATE
FOR MRS. ANDREWS.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.355
WE NEED TO GO.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.440
- WAIT. WAIT.
- HELLO?

12:54.523 --> 12:56.317
- IT'S VICTOR.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.485
- WHAT?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.528
- HE'S RIGHT THERE.

12:59.612 --> 12:59.904
- VICTOR?

13:03.657 --> 13:06.160
WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE CELLAR.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.578
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

13:07.661 --> 13:10.539
- FLIRTING.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.958
I THINK
I JUST HEARD VICTOR CHUCKLE.

13:13.042 --> 13:13.918
[distant chuckling]

13:14.001 --> 13:15.669
- AW, MAYBE HE'S IN LOVE.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.796
- EWW.
[both snicker]

13:17.880 --> 13:20.799
- OKAY, BAD IDEA COMING DOWN
HERE BEFORE BREAKFAST.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.558
- SO HOW'S YOUR GRAN DOING?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.685
- GOOD.

13:31.769 --> 13:36.023
I GOT A POSTCARD
OF BIG BEN TODAY.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.235
SHE TOLD ME TO ASK YOU
HOW THE POETRY'S GOING.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.738
- UH, WELL, NOT SO GOOD.

13:42.821 --> 13:43.739
[laughter]

13:43.822 --> 13:45.908
- THE TIMEPIECE, CHILD.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.660
WATCH THE TIMEPIECE.

13:50.287 --> 13:54.583
- WAS THAT HER?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.043
- YEAH.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.049
IT FEELS LIKE
SHE'S ALWAYS WATCHING.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.684
[bell ringing]

14:11.767 --> 14:12.601
- AH.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.478
UH, HOMEWORK IN BY NEXT FRIDAY.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.730
- FANCY A TRIP INTO TOWN, DUDE?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.023
- ALFIE, NO!

14:18.107 --> 14:19.441
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME ALL ALONE...

14:19.525 --> 14:22.611
NOT WHEN I'M LIKE THIS.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.279
- SORRY, NO CAN DO, BUDDY.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.116
- WOULD YOU--

14:27.199 --> 14:28.200
- JEROME MAKES A RUDE GESTURE

14:28.284 --> 14:29.285
AND YOU LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT, ALFIE?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.537
- YOU CAN SEE?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.872
- IT'S A SIXTH SENSE.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.418
- [yelps]
- SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.460
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.963
- YOU'RE NOT JUST LATE.

14:41.046 --> 14:45.342
CLASS FINISHED FIVE MINUTES AGO.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.594
- DETENTION FRIDAY, BOTH OF YOU.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.512
- NO.
- [scoffs]

14:53.100 --> 14:55.185
BOOK SEARCH?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.312
- FROBISHER LIBRARY?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.617
- OH, MY.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.457
creak!

15:16.540 --> 15:18.751
- WHO'S THERE?

15:24.632 --> 15:25.799
COME DOWN HERE IMMEDIATELY.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.843
- HEY, TRUDY.
- [screams]

15:27.926 --> 15:30.512
[gasping, panting]

15:30.596 --> 15:31.930
- [stammers]
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:32.014 --> 15:34.767
- I SWEAR,
I WAS ONLY GONE FOR TWO MINUTES.

15:34.850 --> 15:35.643
I JUST WENT
TO GET MY CLEANING THINGS.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.437
AND WHEN I GOT BACK...

15:38.520 --> 15:39.813
THEY'VE ALL BEEN OPENED.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.359
WHAT'S JASPER GOING TO SAY?

15:43.442 --> 15:47.613
AND I THINK
THE INTRUDER'S STILL HERE,

15:47.696 --> 15:49.031
UP ON THE MEZZANINE.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.077
- WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.245
DUST THEM TO DEATH?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.624
- DO YOU HAVE A KEY?

15:58.707 --> 15:59.333
LET'S LOCK THEM IN HERE

15:59.416 --> 16:02.836
AND GO GET HELP.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.055
[lock clicking]

16:17.976 --> 16:20.020
[keys jingling]

16:28.487 --> 16:30.155
- YOU SAID YOU HAD
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR ME?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.073
- MM.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.826
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.869
PRETTY EASY TO TRACK DOWN
IN THE END.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.371
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.874
GOT THE ADDRESS, HUNG AROUND,
RIFLED THROUGH THE TRASH.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.377
SOME PRETTY JUICY STUFF
IN THERE.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.336
OH.
CAREFUL WITH THAT ONE.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.672
HMM.
IT'S GOT CAT FOOD ON IT.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.382
AT LEAST, UH...

16:48.465 --> 16:51.093
I THINK IT'S CAT FOOD.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.096
NOW, HERE'S THE ADDRESS.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.848
AND THAT'S HER PHOTO.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.811
- THAT...

17:00.894 --> 17:02.062
IS MY MOTHER.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.439
I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES

17:03.522 --> 17:04.440
BECAUSE OH, YEAH,
I LIVE THERE TOO.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.233
- SO WHY DID YOU ASK ME
TO FIND HER?

17:07.317 --> 17:08.569
- I DIDN'T.

17:08.652 --> 17:09.486
- WELL, HERE'S THE PIECE
OF PAPER YOU GAVE ME.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.654
LOOK.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.366
"JOAN CLARKE."

17:14.450 --> 17:16.326
- "JOHN."

17:16.410 --> 17:18.746
IT SAYS "JOHN CLARKE."

17:18.829 --> 17:20.914
- THAT'S NEVER AN "H."

17:20.998 --> 17:22.124
- YOU'RE FIRED.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.459
- HOLD ON, SON.

17:26.502 --> 17:30.132
NOT SO FAST.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.592
FIRE ME IF YOU LIKE.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.846
BUT YOU STILL
HAVE TO PAY YOUR BILL.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.139
slap!

17:37.222 --> 17:39.057
YOU'VE GOT 48 HOURS.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.233
- THE BOOK IS NOT THERE.

17:52.112 --> 17:56.909
SOMEONE HAS SENT ME
ON A FOOL'S ERRAND, CORBIERE.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.453
BUT WHO?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.789
HMM?

18:04.583 --> 18:05.542
- NO.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.170
MR. SWEET
SEARCHED THE WHOLE PLACE.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.005
EVERYTHING'S STILL IN HERE,
I THINK.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.383
- I FOUND ANOTHER ONE.

18:13.467 --> 18:17.387
- OH, GREAT.
THAT MAKES EIGHT.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.347
- WHAT'S THAT?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.973
- IT'S A LENDING LEDGER.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.518
IT DATES RIGHT BACK TO THE '60s.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.852
- IF SOMEONE
TOOK IT OUT BACK THEN

18:23.936 --> 18:25.145
AND DIDN'T RETURN IT, THEN--

18:25.229 --> 18:26.355
- BIG LATE FEE.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.649
- [sighs]
WE'LL NEVER FIND IT THEN.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.026
- [murmurs]

18:31.109 --> 18:31.860
RIGHT--YEAH.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.030
<i>FABLES OF EGYPT, VOLUME 7.</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:36.031
IT WAS TAKEN OUT.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.533
- [gasps]
NO!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.577
NOT LONG AGO.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.995
SOMEONE CALLED...

18:42.079 --> 18:43.455
DA BED?

18:43.539 --> 18:44.957
- IS THAT
SOME QUIRKY BRITISH NAME

18:45.040 --> 18:46.041
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF BEFORE?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.377
- I DON'T THINK SO.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.545
WELL, MAYBE IT'S A CODE.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.879
- OKAY.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.841
SO HOW DO WE FIND OUT
WHO DA BED IS?

18:53.924 --> 18:55.509
- JASPER'S ON HIS WAY.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.178
I HOPE, FOR MY SAKE,
EVERYTHING'S STILL IN HERE.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.266
- LET'S GO.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.363
- POOR AMS.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.532
MUST BE AWFUL
NOT BEING ABLE TO READ

19:18.615 --> 19:19.575
WHAT ALL THE CELEBS ARE UP TO.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.242
- I KNOW.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.244
I FEEL REALLY BEHIND.

19:22.327 --> 19:22.744
- SHALL I READ IT FOR YOU?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.997
- THANKS, ALFIE.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.253
- [sighs]

19:31.336 --> 19:31.962
- OH!
NO WAY!

19:32.045 --> 19:33.213
- WHAT?
- [gasps]

19:33.297 --> 19:35.841
NO, THERE'S NO WAY
THOSE TWO ARE DATING.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.051
- WHO?
- INCREDIBLE!

19:38.135 --> 19:40.095
- INCREDIBLE?

19:40.178 --> 19:41.597
FORGET THAT.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.681
THOSE SHOES AND THAT DRESS?

19:42.764 --> 19:43.807
NO, NO, NO.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.560
- OKAY, WHEN DID YOU
GET YOUR SIGHT BACK?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.604
- THIS MORNING.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.440
- YOU'VE HAD ME RUNNING AROUND
AFTER YOU ALL DAY.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.900
- I KNOW.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.152
IT'S JUST, YOU'RE SO GOOD AT
DOING EVERYTHING I SAY.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.489
I THINK IT MIGHT BE YOUR BEST
FEATURE.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.866
- [sniffs]
YEAH.

20:00.949 --> 20:08.874
I AM PRETTY AMAZING, I GUESS.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.751
-<i> BONJOUR, LA CLASSE.</i>

20:10.834 --> 20:13.128
-<i> BONJOUR, MADAME ANDREWS.</i>

20:13.211 --> 20:15.422
- SORRY WE'RE...
slam!

20:15.505 --> 20:16.340
LATE.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.841
- TWICE IN ONE DAY.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.344
IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.512
-<i> DESOLE, MADAME ANDREWS.</i>

20:22.596 --> 20:28.060
<i>JE VOUS EN PRIX DE PARDONNE</i>
<i>NOTRE REGARDE EN POLIE.</i>

20:28.143 --> 20:29.937
- MM!
NICE TOUCH, NINA.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.939
YOU'VE JUST SAVED YOURSELF
A SECOND DETENTION.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.774
NOW, SIT DOWN.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.235
- NICE WORK, NINA.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.446
WHY DOES SUCKING UP
TO OLD DAPHNE NEVER WORK FOR ME?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.325
- DAPHNE ANDREWS.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.701
- I DON'T GET IT.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.662
HE MISSES STUDY BUDDY SESSIONS

20:46.745 --> 20:48.914
TO SPEND EVEN MORE TIME
WITH HER,

20:48.997 --> 20:50.832
AND YET HE'S WRITING ME POEMS.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.085
- JOY,
IT DIDN'T HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.127
- OH, YOU SEE,
I SEE YOUR MOUTH MOVING,

20:54.211 --> 20:57.381
BUT I'M JUST NOT LISTENING.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.091
- NINA.
NINA, NINA.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.844
WHAT IF "DA BED"
ISN'T AN ACTUAL NAME?

21:02.928 --> 21:03.679
WHAT IF IT'S INITIALS?

21:03.762 --> 21:04.680
- WHAT?

21:04.763 --> 21:05.347
- LOOK.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.933
DAPHNE ANDREWS, B.E.D.,

21:08.016 --> 21:09.935
BACHELOR OF EDUCATION.

21:10.018 --> 21:10.894
DA BED.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.854
-<i> OUI, OUI.</i>

21:15.273 --> 21:17.025
[knocking at door]

21:17.109 --> 21:19.861
- HI.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.738
HOW'D YOU GET ON WITH ROPER
THIS LUNCHTIME?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.240
- AMAZING.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.700
HE'S LIKE
THE GHOST OF SHERLOCK HOLMES,

21:24.783 --> 21:25.367
BUT WAY MORE EXPENSIVE.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.619
I OWE HIM FOR THIS.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.286
THIS!

21:28.370 --> 21:30.163
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.581
I'M JUST GONNA CHUCK IT.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.338
- WHAT IS IT?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.840
- IT'S A LETTER TO MY MUM.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.925
- IS IT FROM HIM?

21:42.009 --> 21:42.926
YOUR DAD?

21:43.010 --> 21:46.054
IS THERE AN ADDRESS ON THIS ONE?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.266
JEROME?

21:49.349 --> 21:49.808
JEROME.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.727
WHAT IS IT?
