WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:03.396
I decided if I was gonna
get my boobs done...

00:03.560 --> 00:06.358
...I might as well go whole-hog,
you know what I mean?

00:06.520 --> 00:08.795
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.673
They're still pretty natural-Iooking,
don't you think?

00:11.840 --> 00:13.831
They fooled me.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.833
Oh, yeah, gotta get right up on them
before you can tell.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.158
I think they're really gonna help me
reach my career goals.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.476
Do you remember what they were?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.437
What what were?

00:25.600 --> 00:27.750
My career goals.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.919
Yeah, sure.
You wanna be an actress, right?

00:32.119 --> 00:35.157
No, silly. I wanna be a talk show host.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.234
Right.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.150
Of course, what they don't tell you is:
Big boobies equal bad back.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.595
Say that three times fast.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.036
- No, thank you.
- Big boobies equal bad back.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.590
Big boobies equal bad back.
Big boobies equal bad back.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.150
Get your skinny little butt in here,
and I'll interview you standing up.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.398
I'll be right there.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.238
Okay, we're back.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.233
Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome
to my next guest...

01:05.400 --> 01:09.757
...and my close personal friend,
Charlie Harper.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.199
Hey. Where you off to?

01:18.040 --> 01:21.157
I don't know. Anywhere.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.954
Charlie, the shower's still running.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.394
Oh, fine.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.710
There you are.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.148
Charlie! Charlie, help me!

01:39.560 --> 01:42.552
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Go watch TV.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.796
Yeah, right.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.040 --> 01:57.749
Well, I'm sorry, Alan, but who told you
to go sticking your hand in my shower?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.312
Oh, please. How can she sue you?
You have no money.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.799
Oh, boy.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.195
Nothing. Just saw an old girlfriend.
Talk to you later.

02:10.639 --> 02:11.914
Lisa?

02:12.600 --> 02:13.874
Oh, boy.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.989
Charlie. I don't believe it.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.631
- You look great.
- You too.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.392
Although if you're taking votes, I prefer
the brown sock to the beige one.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.791
What? Oh, I got kind of dressed
in a hurry this morning.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.833
Really? Did somebody's husband
come home early?

02:31.800 --> 02:34.997
Why do you always assume the worst?
Can't I just be hung-over?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.791
Sorry. So how are you?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.470
Fine. I mean, you know, considering.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.432
And you? How's married life?

02:43.640 --> 02:46.074
Really great.
Best decision I ever made.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.276
You deserve all the
happiness in the world...

02:48.440 --> 02:51.876
...and you found a guy who can give it.
- Thanks. That's very sweet.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.516
- I mean it sincerely. It warms my heart...
- Okay, we broke up.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.996
Oh, I am so, so sorry. Honestly.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.870
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

03:05.000 --> 03:09.312
- So, what happened?
- None of your business.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.918
Okay.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.750
I thought he was the sweetest guy
in the world...

03:19.920 --> 03:21.717
...but after we got married,
he changed.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.872
He started drinking a lot,
and lying around the house all day.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.196
Oh, no.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.470
I caught him in the shower
with some bimbo.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.591
Some guys, huh?

03:31.800 --> 03:34.872
Yeah. If I wanted that kind of life,
I could have stayed with you.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.430
Good point.
So, what are you doing for dinner?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.112
- You're shameless.
- Thank you.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.998
- It's not a compliment.
- Whatever.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.673
What are you doing for dinner?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.916
Charlie, a lot has changed.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.238
I know. I'm older and wiser,
and you're hot and on the rebound.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.839
- Charlie.
- Dinner tonight.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.911
I won't take no for an answer.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.440
Hey, lady.
Lady, you forgot your baby.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.795
Charlie, it's not her baby.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.074
Shall we say 7?

04:08.960 --> 04:13.590
Just out of curiosity, what the hell
happened in your brother's bathroom?

04:14.760 --> 04:16.796
- Nothing.
- Dad was wrestling on the floor...

04:16.959 --> 04:18.678
...with a naked lady.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.714
The quiet ones are always the freaks.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.439
- Jake, I was not wrestling.
- But she was naked.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.676
She was taking a shower,
and I didn't know.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.035
When I reached to turn it off,
she was startled.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.715
It was innocent and there's no reason
to tell your mother, understand?

04:33.920 --> 04:37.629
Sure. By the way,
you have to sign my math test.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.516
Okay. D minus?
Jake, how do you get a D minus?

04:42.720 --> 04:44.836
How do you get wrapped
in a shower curtain...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.797
...with a naked lady?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.872
- Did you show this to your mother?
- No.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.350
- Why not?
- I didn't catch her doing anything.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.794
Okay, I'll sign this.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.154
But you are gonna go study
so this won't happen again.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.239
All right, but I wouldn't
get my hopes up.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.677
If you want something from Dad,
now's a good time.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.712
Oh, Alan, I am having the best day.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.959
- Really? Do share it with me.
- Remember Lisa?

05:18.160 --> 05:22.119
Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slapped
me in your shower this morning?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.312
No, that's Meegan...

05:27.480 --> 05:30.756
...or Megan or Sue.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.788
Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry,
but she married this other guy instead.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.713
They're divorced and we're
having dinner. Isn't that great?

05:39.920 --> 05:43.515
I'd applaud, but my hand
was bitten earlier.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.433
I'm sensing you're upset?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.949
Oh, no, no, no.
Why would I be upset?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.879
I mean, besides the...
The bite and the mild concussion...

05:51.040 --> 05:54.316
...that I got from my head bouncing
off your bathroom floor...

05:54.480 --> 05:57.517
...while your shower buddy
was driving her knee into my groin.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.156
She wants to be a talk show host.
I don't see it. Not with that voice.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.393
And to top it all off, my son
saw me entwined on the floor...

06:05.560 --> 06:09.712
...with Meegan or Megan or Sue...

06:09.880 --> 06:11.950
...and is now blackmailing me.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.518
Kid's a genius.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.036
Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.474
She's got a kid now.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.074
I'm not sure where I'm at
with having an instant family.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.555
I'm sorry. Are we done
with what's bothering me?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.759
I am.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.950
It's like talking to a horny chimp.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.794
Well, that was uncalled for.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.548
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.558
Lisa, me, the kid.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.916
Okay, let's see now.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.196
This is the same woman
you've broken up...

06:48.360 --> 06:50.920
...and gotten back with for years, right?
- Right.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.759
And she turned you down
in order to marry somebody else?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.951
- Yes.
- And then the marriage fell apart...

06:56.120 --> 06:58.429
...and now she's got his baby?
- Yeah.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.393
Sounds perfect. Go for it.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.598
Okay, don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.591
Are you gonna be okay?

07:15.640 --> 07:17.710
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.397
It's just nobody's taken a crap
in my car since college.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.559
Don't be such a baby.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.955
Hey, tell her.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.830
I'll change her diaper while your car
airs out. Then you can take us home.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.956
But what if it happens again?

07:34.160 --> 07:36.754
Don't worry. I'll hold her out
the window till we arrive.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.679
Thank you.
Can I make you a nightcap?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.836
Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.439
Oh, right, right.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.989
And may I say, on behalf
of myself, the maÃ®tre d'...

07:46.160 --> 07:49.755
...and the entire kitchen staff that found
a reason to walk past our table:

07:49.960 --> 07:51.837
You're doing a hell of a job.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.995
Look at what a good
poopie you made.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.791
Mommy's gonna get you
all cleaned up.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.039
- Would you throw this away?
- Sure.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.390
You didn't throw that
on the beach, did you?

08:53.560 --> 08:56.154
No, no. I threw it
on my neighbor's deck.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.314
Long story. He started it.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.870
- So how we doing?
- All done.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.957
Oh, good.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.272
Boy, you hear all these horror stories
about screaming babies...

09:11.440 --> 09:13.715
...but she's not half bad.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.916
She's my little angel.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.556
Kind of weird, huh?
You and me and a baby.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.438
Yeah.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.435
Not that the baby's weird.
It's just the whole, you know, gestalt.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.792
You are so sweet.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.638
I know.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.152
Wanna go upstairs?

09:38.840 --> 09:41.877
- No, I have to go home.
- Why?

09:42.040 --> 09:44.634
What do you mean, why?
I have a baby.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.519
Okay, she can stay too.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.757
I can't spend the night.
I didn't bring enough diapers...

09:50.920 --> 09:52.911
...the bassinet.
I don't have a breast pump.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.839
So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.998
What are you gonna do, Charlie?
Milk me?

10:00.240 --> 10:01.832
What kind of thing is that to say?

10:02.040 --> 10:04.952
What makes you think I'm ready
to jump back into bed with you?

10:05.840 --> 10:08.400
I don't know. Because I'm sweet?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.238
You weren't ready when I was single.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.277
How are you gonna
handle me and a baby?

10:12.440 --> 10:16.228
Easy. I love babies, babies love me.
Look how good I get along with Jake.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.674
Jake's 11.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.752
So? He was 10 when I met him.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.399
Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they?

10:25.280 --> 10:28.431
- Okay, look. If you're serious...
- I am.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.718
- Come over tomorrow night to our place.
I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.598
Or we go to your place now...

10:34.760 --> 10:37.320
...having already eaten,
and see what happens.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.914
Still incapable of delaying
gratification, aren't you?

10:40.080 --> 10:41.877
No, no, no, I've grown.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.156
I learned to put the needs
of others before me.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.117
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.748
The old thoughtless,
selfish Charlie is gone...

10:48.920 --> 10:50.512
...and I say good riddance to him.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.914
Now, come on.
I'll take you home.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.313
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

10:56.480 --> 10:57.833
The baby.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.954
This makes no sense.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.395
It's math. It makes perfect sense.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.473
Well, then I guess we'll just
have to agree to disagree.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.511
No, you just have to do the work.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.516
Well, maybe I have a learning disability,
or a syndrome of some sort.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.393
You don't have a learning disability.
You're just lazy.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.831
Maybe that's the syndrome.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.232
See you later. And by "later,"
I'm hoping tomorrow.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.756
Is there anything in your shower
I need to know about?

11:58.720 --> 12:01.678
Oh, come on. That's the most
action you've had in months.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.510
I have a loose tooth.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.636
Can't you just be happy for me?
The woman I love is back in my life.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.952
That's great. I'm thrilled.
I can't eat apples.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.719
I'll bring you back some
applesauce from Lisa's.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.951
Her kid needs to lay off
the fiber anyway.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.190
Oh, yeah. How's that working out?

12:23.360 --> 12:26.670
With the kid? She's great. I love kids.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.196
Really? Tell me. How many
diapers have you changed so far?

12:30.360 --> 12:34.069
Well, none, actually.
But I am credited with an assist.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.871
- Have you fed the baby?
- No.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.072
- Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby?
- No. What's your point, Alan?

12:40.280 --> 12:43.511
- Nothing. Have fun.
- Thanks.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.631
I intend to.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.914
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.232
- What was that?
- Coyotes, Charlie.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.429
Probably dropped her pacifier.
I'll be right back.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.512
- No, no, no. You stay. I'll take care of it.
- Really?

13:07.680 --> 13:11.753
Oh, yeah. No problem.
I'm great with babies.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.471
Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.355
Be right back.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.756
<i>Hey, little baby, you decent?</i>

13:24.520 --> 13:26.875
<i>Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie.</i>

13:27.040 --> 13:29.998
<i>Not as good as the real thing,</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

13:32.320 --> 13:35.517
<i>Smells like one of us</i>
<i>just crapped our pants.</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:37.796
<i>I sure hope it's you.</i>

13:38.280 --> 13:40.430
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

13:42.760 --> 13:44.478
Charlie? You okay?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.914
- What?
- Is everything okay?

13:49.080 --> 13:52.277
Oh, yeah. Just a little
diaper issue. I can take care of it.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.119
And then I'll be back
to take care of you.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.708
<i>Okay. Let's just take this thing off.</i>

14:03.120 --> 14:05.395
<i>Oh, sweet Lord.</i>

14:07.240 --> 14:10.357
<i>Did you have Thai food</i>
<i>for dinner, or what?</i>

14:10.960 --> 14:14.236
<i>Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps.</i>

14:16.360 --> 14:18.032
Do you need any help?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.918
What?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.638
Do you need any help?

14:23.800 --> 14:25.552
No, we're good.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.035
<i>Okay. Now we wipe the tushy.</i>

14:35.320 --> 14:37.515
<i>Sorry. It's not you. It's me.</i>

14:37.680 --> 14:41.958
<i>Wipe it again. Third time's the charm.</i>

14:42.120 --> 14:45.271
<i>Little powder. Oh, that smells nice.</i>

14:45.440 --> 14:50.389
<i>Maybe a little powder for my tushy.</i>
<i>Don 't tell your mommy.</i>

14:51.880 --> 14:54.872
Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.954
<i>Oh, right.</i>

14:57.320 --> 14:59.834
<i>People of Earth...</i>

15:00.000 --> 15:02.275
<i>... we mean you no harm.</i>

15:05.320 --> 15:08.995
See? This one is wrong, this is wrong.
Jake, you have to check your work.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.673
These are careless mistakes.

15:10.880 --> 15:15.158
Maybe I'm not careless.
Maybe I ate lead paint as a child.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.236
- Here. Do it again.
- Fine.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.319
Dad, are you and Mom related?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.479
I'm sorry. What?

15:32.840 --> 15:36.310
Well, if you marry your cousin,
your kids will be stupid, right?

15:38.600 --> 15:41.114
Jake, you're not stupid,
your mother's not my cousin...

15:41.280 --> 15:44.750
...and you're not going anywhere
until you do your homework.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.070
Like I have somewhere to go.

15:50.520 --> 15:55.355
There we go.
You were a hungry little girl.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.552
Of course she was hungry.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.030
She must of dropped half her
body weight in that last diaper.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.157
What a good burp.
Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie?

16:07.360 --> 16:10.909
Oh, yeah. Wait till you
meet my nephew.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.038
He can belch the theme from <i>Shaft.</i>

16:14.920 --> 16:17.036
All right. Good night, sweetheart.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.798
Oh, there we go.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.757
Now, where were we?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.354
Oh, yeah.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.434
You know, I'm a little tired.
Aren't you tired?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.949
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.436
Was it the breastfeeding? Because
in the restaurant, it turned you on.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.993
I know, but there I wasn't on deck.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.278
So you don't wanna fool around?

16:41.880 --> 16:45.156
It's not that. I'm looking
at the sexiest woman in the world...

16:45.320 --> 16:48.073
...and all I can see is a Thermos.

16:48.640 --> 16:52.599
Charlie, there are things you do with
your penis that aren't exactly a turn-on.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.155
You mean the puppet show?

16:56.160 --> 16:59.914
I thought you loved <i>The Amazing</i>
<i>Adventures of Stretch Armstrong.</i>

17:00.280 --> 17:04.432
That's not what I meant.
Now, come on. Come to mama.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.392
Okay, time. "Come to mama"
bums me a little.

17:09.760 --> 17:13.309
Can we make it
"Come to Catholic schoolgirl"?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.478
Yes, Monsignor.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.796
Hallelujah.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.674
Here you go. Two sugars, no cream.

17:26.839 --> 17:32.358
Oh, perfect. And I don't mind saying,
last night was none too shabby either.

17:32.880 --> 17:37.829
"Dear diary: Coffee perfect,
sex none too shabby."

17:38.560 --> 17:40.551
You know what I mean.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.228
I can't remember
why we kept breaking up.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.991
- You can't?
- Well, I can. I was just being romantic.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.033
- What are you doing?
- Putting on my pants.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.549
You're leaving already?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.394
No.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.433
So why are you putting
on your pants, then?

18:00.440 --> 18:03.113
I don't know.
Did you wanna wear them?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.032
Forget it.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.357
Hey, I've gotta go home
sooner or later.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.869
- Go home whenever you want.
- I can't leave...

18:13.040 --> 18:14.871
...when you're in this mood.
- What mood?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.314
This mood.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.074
Oh, just leave, Charlie.
It's what you do best.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.795
No, it's what I do after
I do what I do best.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.318
Oh, come on.
I was just putting on my pants.

18:29.480 --> 18:33.268
- You wanna spend the day with us?
- The whole day?

18:35.760 --> 18:39.070
- Here are your shoes.
- Hang on a second.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.435
Is this some hormonal
thing because of the baby?

18:41.600 --> 18:45.229
No, it's some kind of
stupid thing because you're stupid.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.353
Any time I don't behave the way
you want, it's hormonal.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.633
Not every time, but you
gotta admit there is a pattern.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.478
You know the pattern I see?

18:54.640 --> 18:58.076
Every time things start going well for us,
you find an excuse to run.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.872
No, no, no. You push me away.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.957
How? How do I push you away?

19:02.160 --> 19:05.072
Like this. You pick a fight over
nothing and say I can't commit.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.515
- You can't commit.
- Hey, I can commit.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.557
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.399
Fine. I'll start right now.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.308
I'm gonna stay here all day.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.319
- Really?
- Really.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.560
We're talking a business day, right?

19:33.720 --> 19:38.157
- Hey. How did it go with Lisa?
- I don't think it's gonna work out.

19:38.520 --> 19:42.229
Really? Even with the little baby
there to help smooth things along?

19:43.360 --> 19:44.634
It wasn't the baby.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.434
She has commitment issues.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.191
Oh, that's too bad. Hey, what's that
splattered all over your shirt?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.949
Coffee and breast milk.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.517
What happened?
Did Starbucks merge with Hooters?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.830
Hooterbucks.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.951
I'd like a double-D cup latte, please.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.395
Dad, you gotta sign this.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.351
Another D?
Jake, what is wrong with you?

20:25.520 --> 20:27.476
Well, I have a theory.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.278
Oh, really? Another one. Do tell.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.277
I'm a crack baby.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.556
Kid's a genius.
