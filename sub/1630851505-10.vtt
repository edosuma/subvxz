It's like his own little lab.

GRISSOM:
Anson Wix.

SIDLE:
He was calling all the shots.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.031
I'm Martin Kline.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.101
SIDLE:
Wix killed Kline
to keep him from flipping.

00:35.168 --> 00:39.272

You're talking about
a really involved conspiracy.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.807
GRISSOM:
They finally made a mistake.

ROBY:
What are you leaving out,

00:42.842 --> 00:45.311

Wix wanted that
old blind cop iced.

This was our last shot.

Mr. Hodges is on the run

00:53.586 --> 00:56.189

Gil!

01:08.768 --> 01:11.237
The LVPD spokesman I talked to

01:11.304 --> 01:13.339
said the manhunt
for David Hodges

01:13.406 --> 01:15.442
is the department's
top priority.

01:15.508 --> 01:18.645
That explosive confession
posted online,

01:18.711 --> 01:20.847
the admission
that he tampered with evidence

01:20.914 --> 01:22.782
in hundreds of cases,

01:22.849 --> 01:25.752
has infuriated
the law enforcement community

01:25.819 --> 01:28.121
and many others.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.609
Hodges didn't run.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.377
He was taken.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.645
You sound pretty sure.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.113
GRISSOM:
We found

01:54.180 --> 01:57.116
Velcro and canvas
from his ankle monitor.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.155
Blood's not Hodges', though.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.456
This is O negative.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.325
Same as Guillermo.

I-I'm sorry,

02:05.391 --> 02:07.293
I'm, like, way behind.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.293
We think

02:07.360 --> 02:08.895
these might have been used
to cut out the tongue

02:08.962 --> 02:10.830
of a drug dealer named
Guillermo Chaves.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.565
SIDLE:
He had been talking to us.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.434
Wix has cartel clients

02:14.501 --> 02:16.870
that will do his dirty work.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.339

02:19.405 --> 02:21.541
And they left that,
why, as a gift?

02:21.608 --> 02:24.277
I mean, cartels don't have
a minimum IQ for membership.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.178
There aren't any prints,
though.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.279
This is Wix putting
his thumb in our eye.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.816
These do not prove that
Hodges' confession was fake.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.352
No. These words
are gonna speak a lot louder

02:32.418 --> 02:34.754
than a tenuous link
to a drug murder.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.356

Do you think
he's still...

02:36.422 --> 02:38.191
alive?

Let's not speculate.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.711
Why double down?

He was gonna get
his guilty verdict

03:34.047 --> 03:37.317

loaded for bear.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.384
Hodges was offered

to get away.

12:32.985 --> 12:36.889
Want to guess what kind of car
this bad boy came from?

12:36.956 --> 12:39.091
Or I could just tell you.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.459
It came
from an old Chrysler.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.228
Pretty sure
an '88 LeBaron.

12:42.294 --> 12:45.464
Wait, how did you determine
that year and model so quickly?

12:45.531 --> 12:46.532
I started
with the vehicles registered

12:46.599 --> 12:48.134
to Guillermo's
known associates.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.435
And this guy's car has

12:49.502 --> 12:51.470
the exact same
trunk release.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.906
Say hello
to Alfredo Rincon.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.342
ROBY: I know this guy--
he was one of the fellas I was

12:56.408 --> 12:58.377
tailing all over Spring
Valley last week.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.812
He goes by Tiny?

12:59.879 --> 13:01.847
My man's six-five, 250.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.349
I guess that aka must be

13:03.415 --> 13:05.351
some of that famous
Cartel de Sinaloa humor.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.553
ROBY:
Mm.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.355
RAJAN:
Hey, boss.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.357
Yeah.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.357
I've got something for you.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.899
The gun that killed Guillermo
has been used before.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.836
I am guessing
that David Hodges

13:23.903 --> 13:25.871
overheard one
of his kidnappers

13:25.938 --> 13:27.373
call Mr. Rincon

13:27.439 --> 13:30.376
by his nickname Tiny.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.145
So this must have been what
Hodges was trying to tell us

13:33.212 --> 13:34.947
when he left this message.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.182
LVPD is knocking on doors,

13:36.248 --> 13:38.450
looking for Mr. Rincon
and Manuel Garza.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.252
SIDLE: You found
something new on Garza?

13:40.319 --> 13:41.587
Actually something old.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.489
The slug we pulled
out of Guillermo

13:43.556 --> 13:47.293
was a ballistics match
to a 2007 cold case.

13:47.359 --> 13:50.829
And the victim's name was
Trina Sud.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.531
And Garza was a suspect
in that murder?

13:52.598 --> 13:55.334
More like the only suspect. They
didn't have enough to charge.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.871
And I can't say 100%
if Garza killed Guillermo.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.340
We're close.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.340
So this is who took Hodges.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.008
Looks like it.

14:03.075 --> 14:05.411
The ink in Guillermo's wrists--
thin-layer chromatography

14:05.477 --> 14:07.379
says it's Diplomat Royal Blue.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.448
From a fountain pen.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.057
SIDLE:
You see?

14:18.123 --> 14:20.025
It's always in his front pocket.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.027
It kind of makes me nervous.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.630
This is why they invented
pocket protectors.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.000
That pen is a Parker, they only
take a few kinds of cartridges.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.908
The Diplomat Royal Blue ink
in Guillermo's

14:35.975 --> 14:38.177
wrists must have come
from Wix's pen.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.080
Or somebody else
is using the same ink.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.581
That's what Wix'll say.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.451
Well, then we need his pen--
if Guillermo's DNA is on it,

14:45.517 --> 14:48.420
then Wix'll have a hard
time explaining that away.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.323
Maybe I can borrow it.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.323
Hey.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.660
They found Tiny Rincon.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.468
What's that orange stuff?
You putting that on my shoe?

15:02.534 --> 15:04.169
No, Mr. Tiny, it was there.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.371
I'm just taking it
off your shoe.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.605
Be nice to know
where you've been lately.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.009
ROBY:
Unless you want to tell us
where David Hodges is.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.610
I don't know no David Hodges.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.513
I seen him on the news,
that's it.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.116
What about Manuel Garza?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.116
(scoffs)

15:17.182 --> 15:19.351
We want him for murder.
He's your buddy, right?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.387
I don't know any Manuel...

15:21.453 --> 15:23.022
Come on, Tiny.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.156
My name's Alfredo.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.691
I don't know
any Tiny.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.593
Do you not remember, like,
two hours ago when we found you

15:27.660 --> 15:30.462
at your mother's apartment?
Even she called you Tiny.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.332
Well, yeah, yeah, sometimes.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.968
You're negative for GSR.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.636
So...

15:37.703 --> 15:39.638
maybe you were
just an accomplice.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.308
You and Garza
silenced Guillermo

15:42.374 --> 15:44.310
and then you made
David Hodges talk.

15:44.376 --> 15:45.344
We know

15:45.411 --> 15:47.179
David Hodges was in that room.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.614
And this little note
that he started

15:48.681 --> 15:50.683
makes me think
that you were in there, too.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.985
Hmm.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.524
Never been there.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.225
(scoffs)
Then why's your name

15:58.590 --> 16:00.225
on the floor?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.061
People go missing
in this town

16:02.127 --> 16:03.996
all the time.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.298
Maybe your friend just...

16:06.365 --> 16:08.967
checked in someplace and then...

16:09.034 --> 16:10.602
checked out.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.371
FOLSOM:
What-what is that supposed
to mean?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.174
Where's your car?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.174
Hmm, no sé.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.042
Is that because maybe
you left something interesting

16:17.109 --> 16:18.577
in the trunk, a little blood?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.412
Some zip ties, a pen maybe?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.281
Or is your forgetfulness

16:22.348 --> 16:25.384
because you shoved that
down Guillermo's throat?

16:22.348 --> 16:25.384
TINY: That's it?

16:28.253 --> 16:31.357
Your friend drew a word
in the dirt.

16:32.758 --> 16:35.427
And some other dude
swallowed a knob?

16:35.494 --> 16:38.597
Like you think would be
on my old car?

16:40.466 --> 16:43.235
That's not enough to charge me.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.404
Your "old car."
Mm.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.173
It broke down too much,
so I had to...

16:48.240 --> 16:50.642
get rid of it.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.579
I guess I got
to Uber out of here.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.183
I can, uh, go, right?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.586
SIDLE:
We got to find that car.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.790
All right, Danny, right
through here, bring her in.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.534
I think there must be
some kind of mistake.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.103
That's not a Chrysler LeBaron.

17:18.170 --> 17:18.804
Oh, it is.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.773
I mean, was, yeah.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.208
Belonged to Alfredo Rincon.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.410
There, see?

17:24.476 --> 17:27.146
So when he said
he got rid of it?

17:24.476 --> 17:27.146
RAJAN: He junked it.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.181
Is there really
a whole car in there?

17:29.248 --> 17:32.050
Dude out there said they
just baled it this morning.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.385
If it ain't
what you wanted,

17:33.452 --> 17:34.753
you want me
to take it back?

17:33.452 --> 17:34.753
No, no, no.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.288
We'll take it, thanks.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.524
Not ideal, but if
there's any evidence

17:38.590 --> 17:40.325
that Wix was involved
in Guillermo's murder...

17:40.392 --> 17:42.327
It's still in
there somewhere.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.768
So I got the hearing
on my ex parte motion moved up.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.538
Yeah, so tomorrow should be
a slam dunk.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.706
And the...

17:55.841 --> 17:58.277
And I'm gonna
call you back.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.646
Bye.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.848
What are you doing here?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.716
I'm about to solve
this crossword.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.552
I got one left-- 43 down.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.220
And I'm out of ink.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.789
Do me a favor,
can I borrow your pen?

18:10.856 --> 18:13.158
Take two seconds.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.309
Nine letters, Latin legal term.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.377
"De minimus."

18:32.444 --> 18:36.181
"Of the smallest things."

18:32.444 --> 18:36.181
"Smallest things."

18:36.248 --> 18:39.151
That's what your life
has been all about, right?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.453
Yeah, well, you know,
they add up.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.721
Not this time.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.894
I just wanted to tell you that

18:48.961 --> 18:52.331
if David Hodges doesn't return
to the land of the living,

18:52.397 --> 18:55.601
I'm gonna send you to prison,
one way or another.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.736
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.873
Be careful, Dr. Grissom,
I know people.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.689
Moment of truth.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.601
PARK:
This orange business you found

19:29.668 --> 19:32.838
on Wix's bag, it's the same
stuff that was on Tiny's shoes?

19:32.905 --> 19:35.674
Ethyl acetate, limonene, and
about a dozen other synthetics.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.443
Put 'em together, and you get
an industrial fragrance.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.845
"Industrial fragrance"
sounds nasty.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.180
Perfume for buildings.
Casinos use them to mask

19:42.247 --> 19:44.182
the smell of nicotine
and other things.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.617
They never heard of Febreze?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.486
Casinos control
all five of your senses.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.856
Every sound from a slot machine
is in B minor.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.758
Busy carpet patterns
keep your eyes

19:52.824 --> 19:55.294
up on the blinking lights.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.830
You don't hold onto cash,
you toss away chips

19:58.897 --> 20:00.866
that feel like toys.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.303
The drinks are free
if you're playing.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.206
Even the air has
its own signature scent.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.741
You're not having a good time;
a good time

20:09.808 --> 20:12.210
is being injected into
your central nervous system.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.946
GRISSOM: The guests are
injecting themselves

20:14.012 --> 20:15.614
into a central nervous system.

20:15.681 --> 20:18.317
The biggest brains in Las Vegas
don't go to the casinos,

20:18.383 --> 20:19.685
Chris, they are the casinos.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.853
This stuff doesn't
just drip on you.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.256
Wix and Rincon must've
been stained at the source.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.258
A big HVAC system.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.794
What was it Rincon said?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.830
"Maybe your friend
checked in someplace

20:31.897 --> 20:34.333
and then checked out"?

20:34.399 --> 20:36.401
Think they took Hodges
to a hotel?

20:36.468 --> 20:39.538
Only 150,000 guest
rooms in Las Vegas.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.506
We've really
narrowed it down.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.609
No, no, but we will.
These are designer fragrances.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.377
And this one
must've been designed

20:45.444 --> 20:46.812
for someplace
in particular.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.282
Where do we even start?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.951
It's like the Zen monk said.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.853
To begin...

20:54.920 --> 20:56.722
begin.

20:59.324 --> 21:02.294
Mr. Wix, we're coming for you.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.264
♪ ♪

21:31.657 --> 21:33.659
♪ ♪

21:41.400 --> 21:44.002
Yo, pyro,
need some caffeine?

21:44.069 --> 21:46.772
No, I'm good.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.342
I was just thinking
back a few months.

21:50.409 --> 21:52.511
Your pawnshop case.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.614
The Salvador Dali gun blob.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.614
Yeah.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.083
When Mark asked me
to move in with him.

21:59.951 --> 22:02.354
Right.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.356
I had this impulse then
to toss his key

22:04.423 --> 22:06.491
in with the rest of the metal
you were melting.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.565
Hugo said that you're never
gonna talk to me

22:13.632 --> 22:16.068
about Mark because
you're too professional.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.036
Don't worry.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.572
I'm gonna be
more professional, too.

22:23.775 --> 22:24.743
(rattling)

22:24.810 --> 22:27.012
What's that?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.880
It's the ashtray.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.649
Huh.

22:30.716 --> 22:32.984
Looks like someone
with pink lipstick

22:33.051 --> 22:35.353
was a guest
in Tiny's car recently.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.756
I wonder what she knows.

22:39.658 --> 22:41.093
Oh, yeah.

22:41.159 --> 22:44.496
It's a lighter-- might be
able to grab a print off it.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.368
Maybe if you-- ah...

22:48.066 --> 22:50.368
Uh-huh.

22:50.435 --> 22:51.536
And then...
Yep.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.972
Nice. Huh.
Okay.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.444
Gotcha.

22:59.511 --> 23:00.812
Tiffani Winters.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.147
Tiffani with an "I."

23:02.214 --> 23:04.649
You think that's
her original, given name?

23:04.716 --> 23:06.551
Maybe her parents always
knew she was gonna be

23:06.618 --> 23:07.552
an exotic dancer.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.620
(both chuckle)

23:08.687 --> 23:10.522
Two priors for solicitation.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.423
At the Panther Den.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.792
Guess I know
where we're having lunch.

23:15.594 --> 23:16.862
Hmm.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.900
I really wish there was
a National Smells Database.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.668
Any of the casinos
willing to play ball?

23:23.735 --> 23:25.971
No. So I had to go
straight to the source.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.706
Turns out there are
two companies

23:27.773 --> 23:29.975
that make most
of the industrial scents

23:30.041 --> 23:31.543
in this town.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.868
the sample we got
from his shoes, so...

35:36.934 --> 35:38.336
And people say

35:38.402 --> 35:39.904
I'm curious...

35:38.402 --> 35:39.904
I-I'm sorry.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.340
I'm not entirely sure
how this helps.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.340
These chemicals

35:42.406 --> 35:45.443
are changing.
We thought they were stable.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.678
It might have started out
as something different.

35:47.745 --> 35:50.348
Also, something Bryan told me.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.749
All these casinos,

35:51.816 --> 35:53.584
they steal from each other.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.587
Employees. Table games.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.587
Fragrances.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.688
We need to find out

35:57.755 --> 35:59.357
where this scent started.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.259
You're the materials
and elemental analysis lady.

36:01.325 --> 36:04.262
I think it's time for you
to play with some molecules.

36:10.234 --> 36:13.170
It's beautiful, but it
looks a little unstable.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.605
Well, they have to be.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.607
Perfumes are designed
to release their top notes.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.410
Like a lot of things,
as they age...

36:19.477 --> 36:20.611
They mellow?

36:20.678 --> 36:22.747
Base notes are more standard.

36:22.813 --> 36:24.282
Oils, mostly.
It can be hard

36:24.348 --> 36:27.318
to tell what was sitting
on top, but I don't think

36:27.385 --> 36:30.187
that we're looking
at the Mosaic Casino's scent.

36:30.254 --> 36:33.891
I think we're looking
at a rapidly aging knockoff.

36:30.254 --> 36:33.891
So, Wix

36:33.958 --> 36:36.761
and his underling were splashed
with a chemical counterfeit?

36:36.827 --> 36:38.262

36:40.498 --> 36:41.632
The Green Emerald.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.668

We just wanted to say thank you.

He told us everything.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.697
Well,

I guess he'll get to tell
his story to the jury,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.635

39:31.702 --> 39:33.037
I got a story for you.

This con man lawyer

39:45.683 --> 39:47.985
his fraud fails.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.887
