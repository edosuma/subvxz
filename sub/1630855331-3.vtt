00:40.640 --> 00:43.320
If you're gonna scratch your nose,
go back to the same pose afterward.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.600
Why do I have to be here?
It's Ricky's birthday.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.960
And he's your brother.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.560
Okay, we all ready to go?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.720
Lily, you're released.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.480
Hey.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.160
So, um, Henry was wondering
how long till dinner.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.600
Huh.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.520
I guess I could start.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.640
Is that all you do, Mr. Potts?
Invent things?

02:04.720 --> 02:07.240
-Is that all I do?
-Oh, and what's this gadget?

02:07.320 --> 02:10.920
That's not quite right yet, but eventually
I hope to transmit moving pictures

02:11.000 --> 02:12.200

02:12.280 --> 02:13.960

-[man] Yes, really.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.480
-As Marconi--
-[woman] And this?

02:16.080 --> 02:18.760
[man] This, madam,
is a sweet-making machine.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.000
-[woman] And is this one of the sweets?
-[man] Yes, it is.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.520
-Is that yours too?
-Uh, excuse me.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.800
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yeah.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.680
Uh, I apologize for the intrusion,
but, uh, you're David Ross?

02:31.760 --> 02:32.680
I believe I am.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.640
-It's an honor to meet you, sir.
-Oh my God. Such an honor.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.520
-Thank you. You're too kind.
-[chuckles]

02:41.000 --> 02:44.080
You are so real. Uh, it's incredible.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.080
May I?

02:47.160 --> 02:48.760
Oh my God.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.800
It's amazing.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.240
So, up there,
are you, like, sleeping right now?

02:53.320 --> 02:54.720
It's a kind of sleep.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.600
The human experience,
the survival of the human body, of life,

02:57.680 --> 02:59.320
that's really central to the mission--

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
[clears throat]

03:01.760 --> 03:03.520
Anyway, we have to be--

03:03.600 --> 03:05.160
-So great to meet you.
-So great.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.800
I know they're excited, but sometimes
they are so goddamn rude.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.600
Oh, but they don't realize, honey.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.120
Our Lord, Heavenly Father,
bless us and these thy gifts

03:18.200 --> 03:22.120
which we take from thy bountiful goodness
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.880
Amen.

-[woman] Amen.
-[boy] Amen.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.160
[David] I know, but you guys have to wait.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.560
Wait a second.
I said wait for ready, set, go!

03:58.320 --> 03:59.480

-It's a clear win for Lily.
-[children exclaim]

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360

Coming.

Blood. Real blood,

17:02.280 --> 17:03.480

Yeah, I… I don't doubt you're real.

that's immaterial, sugar.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.640

[whimpers] Please! Please, no!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.960
-Epsilon, you start.
-[woman] No!

18:12.040 --> 18:14.000
-[blade rasps]
-[woman screams] No!

18:14.080 --> 18:15.800
[screaming]

18:15.880 --> 18:18.400
[woman screams] No!

18:18.480 --> 18:20.480
[scream echoes]

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
[tense music playing]

18:42.800 --> 18:44.080
[tense music fades]

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
[phone ringing]

18:52.520 --> 18:53.960
[phone ringing]

18:58.160 --> 18:59.640
[phone ringing]

19:02.360 --> 19:03.240
Hello.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.920
Uh, what?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.640
Wait, wait, wait.
What the hell are you saying?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.080
[breathes deeply]

19:24.680 --> 19:26.040
[device beeping]

19:26.560 --> 19:29.240
[breathes deeply]

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
[zipper unzipping]

19:55.720 --> 19:57.560
[unsettling music playing]

20:09.520 --> 20:10.400
David?

20:22.160 --> 20:23.280
David, it's me.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.040
-[David exhales]
-David.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.560
[David] Leave me alone.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.240
[exhales]

20:43.520 --> 20:44.600
[Cliff] I'm so sorry.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.400
I said get out of here!

20:48.560 --> 20:49.640
[David sniffles]

20:57.520 --> 20:59.840
[footsteps approaching]

21:01.920 --> 21:03.320
[Cliff] He told me to get out.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.080
Spoke to Ground Control.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.720
Holland says just leave him be.
He'll be in shock.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.240
Sons of bitches that did this walked
into a station and gave themselves up.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.600
Some sort of hippie cult.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.680
Board says if we feel we need protection,
we can have it,

21:21.760 --> 21:24.920
but we are a long way from California.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.040
I keep thinking of them.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.520
Jessica.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.840
Those kids.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.760
I can't even imagine.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.200
Bastards even destroyed his replica.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.120
Set it on fire.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.160
That means the whole time
that I am down here, he's just

21:48.680 --> 21:49.720
alone up there.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.400
Two years down on the mission,

21:55.400 --> 21:56.600
another four to go.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.560
Can't they make him
another replica somehow?

21:59.640 --> 22:02.000
They made these
while we were still back down here.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.680
Now it's just not possible.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.440
Even if they could,

22:07.400 --> 22:08.840
what does he have left here?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.320
[ethereal music playing]

22:21.400 --> 22:24.000
[both breathing heavily]

22:25.840 --> 22:27.560
[Cliff] Soil and nutrients stable.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.520
CO light absorption functioning.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.240
Purity at 93%.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.760
[both breathing heavily]

22:42.960 --> 22:44.960
[ethereal music continues]

23:02.400 --> 23:05.560
[man] "The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

23:06.160 --> 23:09.520
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

23:10.520 --> 23:13.200
"He leadeth me beside the still waters."

23:14.520 --> 23:16.520
"He restoreth my soul."

23:17.720 --> 23:21.640
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake."

23:23.040 --> 23:26.560
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

23:27.320 --> 23:28.920
I will fear no evil."

23:30.040 --> 23:31.880
"For thou art with me."

23:31.960 --> 23:34.400
"Thy rod and thy staff,

23:35.400 --> 23:36.600
they comfort me."

23:39.240 --> 23:40.840
-Paying attention?
-[Henry] Yeah.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.480
[Cliff] All right.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.360
[gentle music playing]

23:56.480 --> 23:59.200
[breathes deeply]

-[water splashes]

25:07.080 --> 25:08.160
There we go.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.840
You're up.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.360
[beeping]

25:22.040 --> 25:24.280
Airlock issue. I gotta run.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.920
[zipper unzipping]

25:29.000 --> 25:30.960
[alarm blaring]

25:37.320 --> 25:38.200
[Cliff] Hey!

25:42.000 --> 25:42.920
[knocking on door]

25:43.480 --> 25:44.440
[muffled] Hey!

25:44.520 --> 25:45.920
[alarm continues]

25:46.000 --> 25:47.520
[keypad beeping]

[door lock clicks]

25:51.120 --> 25:52.320
[air hisses]

25:57.200 --> 25:58.440
Everything okay?

26:01.440 --> 26:02.280
Sure.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.920
Just looking things over.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.360
[Lana] You don't know
he was gonna throw himself out.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.520
[Cliff] I don't know.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.560
I mean, if he were to do something,

26:20.440 --> 26:21.880
I'm still up there.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.880
That's a two-man ship.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.040
It relies on the both of us.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.240
If there was, like,
a computer malfunction,

26:32.320 --> 26:33.920
some sort of technical issue,

26:34.520 --> 26:36.080
that is me dead too.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.520
Don't say that.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.280
We have to think about this.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.720
The man is lost.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.200
I can't reach him,
and I don't know what to do.

26:50.680 --> 26:51.880
What if…

26:53.720 --> 26:56.960
what if you let him use your link?

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
My link?

27:01.920 --> 27:02.760
As in…

27:03.400 --> 27:05.640
Say, just for an hour.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.080
Time enough to let him walk in the woods,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.120
feel… feel the breeze on his face.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.000
I don't know.
It'd be strange for you and Henry.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.600
Henry doesn't need to know.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.400
David might not even want that.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.920
Even asking could be a kindness.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.600
[pensive music playing]

27:43.440 --> 27:44.360
Okay.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.680
0800 hours, commencing routine checks.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.240
Distance to target, 4.7 AU.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.280
[keyboard clacking]

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
[sighs]

28:09.920 --> 28:11.280
Listen, David,

28:12.720 --> 28:17.800
I was talking with Lana, and we both feel
that you could use a break.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.280
How would you feel

28:24.640 --> 28:26.360
about using my link?

28:28.960 --> 28:30.240
Just for a little while.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.520
Breathe some… [inhales] …air.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.240
The house, it's a long way from anywhere.
It's real private.

28:39.320 --> 28:43.200
There's a forest out back,
a couple streams for fishing.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.480
It's a good place.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.360
Would you…

28:57.000 --> 28:58.200
would you like that?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.240
I think I'd like that very much.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.120
So…

29:18.880 --> 29:20.240
I'll head to the link now.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.040
How should I speak to him?

29:25.600 --> 29:26.800
I mean, in manner?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.000
Quiet?

29:30.120 --> 29:31.280
Serious, or…

29:31.960 --> 29:34.240
I don't know, regular?
Like it didn't happen?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.040
I mean…

29:36.920 --> 29:38.000
You know what I mean.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.800
Well… [sighs] …he used to be talkative,

29:42.880 --> 29:45.160
but right now, he's not easy to read.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.200
Just let him take in the air.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.560
[Cliff] You ready?

30:05.640 --> 30:08.200
[breathes deeply]

30:14.440 --> 30:17.360
[breathing nervously]

[device beeping]

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
[gentle string music playing]

32:08.040 --> 32:08.920
Hello.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.160
Hi.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.680
Cliff said it might take
a little getting used to.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.000
Would you like to see the forest?

32:42.760 --> 32:43.600
Yes.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.080
Thank you.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.960
[string music intensifies]

33:10.160 --> 33:11.320
[exhales]

33:12.720 --> 33:13.600
[Cliff] Wow.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.360
This is my favorite spot.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.240
[Cliff] Mm.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.600
[exhales]

33:39.360 --> 33:41.320
The air is so clear.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.400
I'd forgotten.

33:47.720 --> 33:48.640
Hm.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.880
Hey.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.640
[chuckles]

34:05.640 --> 34:06.520
Hey.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.360
[chuckles]

34:14.600 --> 34:15.560
He likes you.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.320
[chuckles]

34:48.840 --> 34:49.800
[sobs]

34:51.320 --> 34:52.240

[Cliff crying]

35:34.720 --> 35:35.880
[music fades]

35:42.000 --> 35:43.200
[Lana] What is it?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.200
Uh…

35:45.080 --> 35:45.960
Nothing.

35:46.680 --> 35:47.600
Just…

35:49.840 --> 35:50.960
You've quite the home.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.920
[muffled chatter]

36:23.120 --> 36:24.800
[soft clatter]

36:55.480 --> 36:56.560
Your place…

36:58.720 --> 36:59.760
is beautiful.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.200
[chuckles softly]

37:02.320 --> 37:03.200
Thank you.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.800
Glad you enjoyed it.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.440
Well, I best be, uh…

37:12.520 --> 37:13.520
Of course.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.800
I'll see you Friday.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.640
[pats shoulder]

37:19.720 --> 37:20.640
See you then.

-[Cliff] Hey.
-[gasps]

38:13.120 --> 38:14.440
[sighs]

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
You scared me.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.760
Well, it feels like that really worked.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.160
He seems a little

38:22.920 --> 38:23.880
lighter now.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.400
So,

38:27.400 --> 38:28.280
how was it?

38:30.880 --> 38:33.040
The poor man. He wept like a child.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.240
In front of you?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.040
Mm-hmm.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.560
What did you do?

38:42.960 --> 38:44.320
Not much. I…

38:45.520 --> 38:47.600
He sat up by the old tree.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.600
What… what could I even say?

38:53.040 --> 38:53.880
Yeah.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.840
[inhales]

38:58.040 --> 38:59.120
[Cliff exhales]

39:03.280 --> 39:04.640
[treadmills whirring]

39:10.160 --> 39:11.000
Hey.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.800
Let me show you something.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.000
-[Cliff] You did this from memory?
-[David scoffs]

39:20.080 --> 39:23.680
When something is vivid,
I just kind of see it.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.840
Wait, this is quite something.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.960
If I had this down there,
I would hang it on the wall.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.520
You know…

39:34.120 --> 39:37.640
if you guys could maybe
get me a canvas and some oils,

39:37.720 --> 39:40.040
I could paint you something like this
for your home.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.120
Like a thank-you gift.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.160
Uh-huh.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.520
I mean, obviously, you'd have
to let me use your replica again.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.240
You might not want to do that.
It's just… [scoffs]

39:53.440 --> 39:54.600
Drawing helps.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.800
I'd love to be able to paint again.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.760
An oil painting.
I mean, how long would a painting take?

40:04.480 --> 40:06.280
Well, a little while, obviously.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.200
Okay.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.280
Look, I understand.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.320
I shouldn't ask. It's not fair.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.760
I'm sorry.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.000
Let me think it over.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.080
Okay?

40:24.480 --> 40:25.320
Okay.

40:27.000 --> 40:27.880
Thank you.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.600
[Lana] Just an hour?

40:31.120 --> 40:32.040
One hour.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.920
Once a week, while I'm doing the physical.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.120
I mean, it does make sense.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.240
He can set up his things
up in the barn there.

40:43.480 --> 40:47.240
He had a list of what he'd need,
canvas and fancy paints and whatnot.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.800
Clearly, it has been on his mind.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.040
What do you say?

40:57.840 --> 40:58.800
Okay?

41:02.280 --> 41:03.560
[device chimes]

41:06.320 --> 41:07.760
[David breathes deeply]

41:08.280 --> 41:10.280
[device beeping]

41:17.240 --> 41:20.160
[Lana] Everything you need?
Think we got your whole list.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.600
Looks like it.

41:23.840 --> 41:24.800
Thank you.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.520
How you finding that? Valley of the Dolls?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.040
Oh. [chuckles]

41:33.040 --> 41:34.840
Can't say I'm crazy about it.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.680
I mean, it's fun,
but my goodness, it's trashy.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.280
A guilty pleasure.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.320
The guiltiest.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.520
Do you like sci-fi?

41:44.320 --> 41:47.360
Can't say I've tried it.
There aren't many books in the house.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.640
Cliff doesn't really read.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.360
I'll think of a few recommendations
for you.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.640
I'd like that.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.200
["Quand on n'a que l'amour"
by Jacques Brel playing]

43:15.400 --> 43:17.320
["Quand on n'a que l'amour" continues]

43:21.160 --> 43:23.040
Sir, may I leave the table?

43:24.040 --> 43:24.920
[Cliff] Good boy.

44:07.520 --> 44:11.200
["Quand on n'a que l'amour" continues]

44:19.680 --> 44:22.400
-[Cliff] Have you done much painting?
-[music ends]

44:22.480 --> 44:24.720
-[Lana] Not since kindergarten.
-[chuckles]

44:28.920 --> 44:29.760
Here.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.560
Um, I can't. I'd make a mess of it.

44:33.640 --> 44:36.560
It's fine. You make a mess,
I can paint right over it.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.560
Here you go.

44:41.280 --> 44:44.200
Why don't you just try to add a little
to the tree there?

44:46.200 --> 44:47.680
[Lana] How… how do I…

44:47.760 --> 44:51.880
Don't be afraid of it.
Just a… just a light… light stroke.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.480
[Lana chuckles]

44:55.560 --> 44:57.120
Okay, that's a blob.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.720
[Cliff] It's fine.
Here, just move the brush through it.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.680
Here.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.600
[whispers] Like…

45:06.640 --> 45:07.480
this.

45:08.080 --> 45:08.960
There we go.

45:09.480 --> 45:10.800
Perfectly good leaf.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.800
[Henry] Mom!

45:14.720 --> 45:17.000
-Better see what he wants.
-[Cliff] Of course.

45:35.960 --> 45:36.920
[device chimes]

45:42.440 --> 45:44.840
[device beeping]

45:55.320 --> 45:57.200
[Cliff] His painting's looking good.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.440
[sighs]

46:43.040 --> 46:44.200
[Lana] Everything okay?

46:44.880 --> 46:47.400
Do you have any linseed oil? I've run out.

46:48.360 --> 46:49.520
Linseed oil?

46:50.080 --> 46:53.280
Yeah. It, uh, thins the paint
without mussing up the color.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.960
Uh, Wesson oil any use to you?

47:03.480 --> 47:04.520
Nah, that won't do it.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.000
Is there a hardware store in town?

47:07.080 --> 47:09.240
There's Mitchell's. They'll be open.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.040
You think Cliff would mind
if we borrow his car?

47:16.480 --> 47:18.480
[pensive music playing]

47:46.560 --> 47:47.600
[sighs]

47:57.360 --> 47:58.520
Got it.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.520
[Cliff] Great.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.800
Hey, I wanna check
the bookstore out a moment.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
You wanna come?

48:07.720 --> 48:08.640
Sure.

48:16.920 --> 48:17.960
He wears it out.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.000
This is a good one.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.640
I think you'll like it.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.320
[sighs] I'm sorry, I have to ask.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.840
Are you Cliff Stanfield?

48:45.760 --> 48:48.200
-Yes.
-[chuckles] I thought it was you.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.800
Well, not you, but your, um…

48:53.440 --> 48:54.760
What do you call it?

48:54.840 --> 48:55.720
Replica.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.720
Replica.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.320
[chuckles] The things they can do!

48:59.840 --> 49:02.240
And you must be Mrs. Stanfield.

49:02.760 --> 49:03.600
Yes.

49:04.320 --> 49:07.760
Heard you both moved
into the old Watson place.

49:07.840 --> 49:08.960
How you finding it?

49:10.240 --> 49:11.400
Well, it's, uh…

49:12.200 --> 49:15.200
-I mean, it's wonderful.
-Oh, so beautiful up that way.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.800
Great place for a family.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.080
Absolutely.

49:21.440 --> 49:26.400
I was so sorry to hear about what happened
with your copilot, Mr. Ross.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.360
His whole family…

49:29.960 --> 49:31.520
Such a terrible thing.

49:33.960 --> 49:34.800
Well…

49:36.680 --> 49:37.520
Yes.

49:39.840 --> 49:40.880
How is he doing?

49:43.920 --> 49:44.880
He's holding up.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.640
We really ought to be going.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.160
Of course.

49:50.920 --> 49:52.360
So nice to meet you.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.320
Thanks.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
[Cliff exhales]

50:09.600 --> 50:10.560
You okay?

50:37.320 --> 50:38.920
[device beeping]

50:39.000 --> 50:40.400
[David inhales deeply]

50:41.800 --> 50:43.640
[exhales]

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
All yours.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.120
Thank you.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.160
See you Friday.

51:47.640 --> 51:48.960
[switch clicks]

51:49.040 --> 51:50.080
[Cliff] Hey.

51:51.120 --> 51:51.960
Take a look.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.760
Is… is that…

52:01.600 --> 52:02.560
You added me?

52:03.480 --> 52:04.840
[Cliff] You don't mind, do you?

52:05.480 --> 52:06.360
[Lana] No.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.040
No, not at all. I'm flattered.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.040
["La mer" by Charles Trenet playing]

52:45.400 --> 52:46.520
[Lana chuckles softly]

53:50.760 --> 53:51.720
[gasps]

54:01.160 --> 54:03.160
["La mer" continues muffled]

54:06.160 --> 54:07.000
[Cliff] Lana!

54:13.320 --> 54:14.240
[exhales]

54:19.960 --> 54:21.080
It's okay.

54:21.920 --> 54:22.840
[exhales]

54:25.000 --> 54:26.880
I've given you the wrong idea.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.040
He won't know.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.280
Stop!

54:35.400 --> 54:36.360
Hey.

54:38.480 --> 54:39.520
You want this.

54:39.600 --> 54:40.680
Get away from me.

54:43.120 --> 54:46.000
You come here. You… you confuse me.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.880
You pick out gifts. You mess with my head.

54:51.160 --> 54:55.200
Work your way into my home
wearing my husband like a suit.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.080
But this is not your home,
and you are not my husband.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.520
That man is no match for you.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.720
You are a guest in this house.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.480
-And you want this.
-You don't know me.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.240
I know the way you look at me.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.280
At you?

55:31.960 --> 55:33.600
[breathes heavily]

55:38.360 --> 55:39.280
[sighs]

55:39.960 --> 55:41.960
[record static playing]

55:59.560 --> 56:00.720
[door opens]

56:10.800 --> 56:11.680
Henry?

56:18.160 --> 56:19.120
You should go.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.240
[Cliff sighs]

56:35.440 --> 56:36.920
[device beeping]

56:37.600 --> 56:38.800
[David breathes deeply]

56:45.000 --> 56:46.720
Everything okay?

56:47.240 --> 56:48.120
All fine.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.360
[Cliff] David says
Henry wrecked his painting.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.280
[Lana] He hit him!

56:54.360 --> 56:56.640
He gave him a little smack
upside the head.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.120
Which, as far as Henry knows,
was from you.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.400
Nothing I haven't done myself
a hundred times.

57:02.480 --> 57:05.720
You know Henry can be a terror.

57:05.800 --> 57:09.520
Remember when he burned a hole
in the car seat? I whaled on him plenty,

57:09.600 --> 57:10.880
right here in this room.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.240
The boy needs keeping in line.

57:17.840 --> 57:18.880
[exhales]

57:20.680 --> 57:21.520
Look.

57:22.680 --> 57:26.040
-David wants to finish the painting.
-The goddamn painting.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.240
I know.

57:29.480 --> 57:33.080
Let's just let him finish the painting.

57:33.680 --> 57:37.240
Okay? That will be one,
two more visits tops.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.480
And then… I will come up with something.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.880
An excuse.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.360
Okay?

57:50.600 --> 57:51.480
Okay.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.280
[footsteps approaching]

58:23.080 --> 58:24.560

58:44.520 --> 58:45.800

58:47.440 --> 58:49.960
-Lana, listen.
-Your things are set up in the barn.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.800
-Lana, please.
-I'm taking Henry to the pool.

58:57.800 --> 58:58.880

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.120
[beeping stops]

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I got an alert.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.320
What's up?

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.120
You gonna explain that?

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.160
[sighs]

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.840
It's ju-- It's… it's a drawing.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.920
Just a stupid--

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.280
Like a fantasy.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.720
Maybe I will bust your jaw.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.320
You want a busted jaw?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.080
I'm sorry. It's not what--

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.560
My wife!

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.040
You fucking creep!

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.360
My wife. Mine!

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.360
It's pure fantasy. I got mixed up.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.800
Oh, you got mixed up?

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.560
She's so beautiful. It's--

-[David groans]
-Jesus Christ.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.840
Why can't you see?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.720
I don't have anything.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.640
I've got nothing at all.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.400
You have no idea what it's like to be me.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.800
Everything I had…

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.600
Gone. Just

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560
destroyed.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.520
You don't know.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.000
You have got it all,

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.400
and you don't even care.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.000
I care plenty.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.840
Your wife is a lonely woman.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.880
She's all alone there.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.520
Unappreciated.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.800
-Unsatisfied.
-You shut your mouth.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.320
Untouched.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.800
I will put you through this goddamn wall!

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.400
[Cliff breathing heavily]

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.240
You don't know what you've got.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.880
I know damn well.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.480
Do you?

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.600
How much longer we gotta sit here?

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.400
Till your father's home.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.600
-[Cliff] Henry, go inside.
-Yes, sir.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
[Cliff exhales]

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.440
[grunting]

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.920
-Cliff, what's wrong?
-Tell me what's gone on.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.960
You and him. What's gone on?

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.600
What did you do?

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.640
I told you, nothing.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.120
Did you pose for him?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.200
No, I did not pose for him.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.400
Show him your body?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.320
Of course not.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.720
Did he touch you?

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.720
No.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.000
Did you touch him?

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.800
-No.
-Take him to our bed?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.560
Absolutely not.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.080
Tell me what happened!

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.280
Nothing. I swear.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.040
He drew you naked.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.200
In his quarters. Up there, onboard.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.840
-I don't know what he drew.
-He draws from memory.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.600
-From memory!
-He has seen nothing.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.280
Give me the truth!

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.600
-I--
-Give me the truth!

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.480
I swear on my life, on Henry's life,
nothing happened.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.200
But he wanted it to.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.440
Yes.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.680
-And you still let him come down here.
-You knew I didn't want him here anymore.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.920
You never said that.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.200
I told you he hit our son,
and you did not listen to me.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.560
You didn't listen!

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.440
He said that

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.920
I don't touch you.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.880
How did he know that?

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.520
I would never say anything like that
to anyone.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.880
So, then, how did he know?

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960
I don't know.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.960
He thinks that you're lonely.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.480
All the time you're here, I'm lonely.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.520
We came here for you!

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.000
You brought me here, put me in this house.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.960
Now I just walk from room to room,
and you walk from room to room,

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.000
but you're a shadow,
and I am here. I am real!

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440
So, no, he didn't touch me,
but I wished he did. I…

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.560
For, like, a… a moment…

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.160
for a moment,
it felt like my husband was back,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.320
and he

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.520
saw that I'm real, and I want that. I…

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.400
And I wished he did too.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.440
[Cliff sniffles]

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.520
[Cliff sniffles]

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.280
[breathing shakily]

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280
[Cliff] I'm sorry.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.800
Hey. [clears throat]

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.600
Listen.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.960
What?

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.560
I wanted to apologize.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.200
I overstepped the mark, and I apologize.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.680
Nothing happened with Lana.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.920
I know.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.120
She wasn't interested.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.240
Listen.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.760
I know you don't want me
using your link anymore. It's just…

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.640
I'd like to apologize to her in person.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.320
I owe her an apology too.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.200
Hey. [clears throat]

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.160
Could I at least say goodbye to her?

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.160
I just wanna say goodbye.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.480
That's not gonna happen.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.280
You know what she told me?

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.640
That your visits offend her.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.680
That you offend her.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.360
The thought of you returning
makes her vomit.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.520
She says that you're a snake.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.440
A conman.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.400
The worst kind.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.640
The arrogant kind.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.000
She won't have you anywhere near her.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.000
She is mine.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.640
For all time, she is mine.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.560
Every day,

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.880
every night,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.080
in every way.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.880
You will not see or speak to her
ever again.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.040
[razor clatters]

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.840
[Cliff] Who's a good boy?

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.720

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.040
[beeping stops]

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.800
Damn it. Some kind of emergency.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.880
What is it?

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.560
Small impact a few minutes ago.
Coolant tubing took a hit.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.920
It's leaking pretty bad.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.440

[tense music playing]

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.240
Hey, I'm at coolant four.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.800
[breathing heavily]

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.920
No visible signs of damage.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.280
David, you sure it was coolant four?

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.200
David?

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.240
David?

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560
[tense music continues]

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.440
[breathing heavily]

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.520
David!

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200
[muffled] David!

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.480
[muffled] David!

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.520
[tense music intensifies]

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.040

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.720
[breathing heavily]

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.920
Where the hell were you?

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.760
Bathroom.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.600
The bathroom?

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.200
Coolant four was fine.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.000
Goddamn system's
sending out false reports.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.360
Gotta get on to McKenzie.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.800
This is not acceptable.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.200
Where's my tag?

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.280
My tag.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.920
What did you do?

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.040
[breathing heavily]

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.600
Come on.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.640

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.280
Lana?

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.120
Lana?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.240
No, no, no, no.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.280
[breathing shakily] No.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.600
Lana?
