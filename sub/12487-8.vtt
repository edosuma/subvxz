00:00.810 --> 00:02.150
- ♪

00:02.210 --> 00:05.510
- And, of course, as starting
quarterback, Bella Dawson.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.710
- What, what!

00:08.790 --> 00:12.490
Sorry, it's
just still so exciting.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.260
- Anyway, so that's our
starting lineup for next week.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.930
Newt, you are not starting.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.300
- Who did that?

00:21.370 --> 00:23.140
- All right, one more thing.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.440
Last week's game ball.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.830
Normally we award this

00:26.900 --> 00:28.830
to the most outstanding player
of the game.

00:28.910 --> 00:32.240
But last week, we had
two outstanding players.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.680
I'm awarding the game ball
to both Sawyer and Troy.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.850
- My wide receivers.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.050
What! What!

00:40.820 --> 00:43.690
Promise, last time.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.280
- You guys, uh,
cool with sharing?

00:46.360 --> 00:47.730
- Of course, my good man.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.030
Indubitably.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.150
Care for a spot of tea?

00:52.630 --> 00:53.330
- Oh, wonderful.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.240
- I knew I never should have
turned you guys

00:57.300 --> 00:59.770
onto "Downton Abbey."

00:59.840 --> 01:01.470
Dawson, a word.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.080
- Coach, I know
what this is about.

01:06.140 --> 01:10.270
And, yes, I promise to keep
my "What! What!" under control.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.150
Well, that's not why
I brought you in here,

01:13.220 --> 01:14.490
but I appreciate that.

01:14.550 --> 01:17.920
Yeah, look, Dawson, when you
first joined the team,

01:17.990 --> 01:19.760
I wanted you to learn the game.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.480
Now that you've done that, it's
time you learn

01:21.560 --> 01:24.900
the other part of being
a quarterback--leadership.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.000
- You can count on me, coach.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.590
- Good.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.740
Because leadership is much more
than throwing touchdown passes.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.500
You gotta guys keep these guys
on their workouts

01:31.570 --> 01:34.910
and practice schedules, make
sure they stay out of trouble,

01:34.970 --> 01:36.740
go to class, wash my car.

01:36.810 --> 01:37.780
- Wash your car?

01:37.840 --> 01:40.450
- All a part
of being quarterback.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.780
But the most important thing
a leader does...

01:42.850 --> 01:45.720
is keep the team together
at all costs.

01:45.780 --> 01:48.310
You gotta keep an eye out
for a potential problems.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.460
Little things can turn
into big things

01:50.520 --> 01:52.760
if you don't nip them
in the bud.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.180
- Coach, I was captain
of the cheer squad.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.700
Problem solving was like
the job description.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.770
One time, Taylor and Madison
were arguing over

01:59.830 --> 02:00.430
whether we should yell

02:00.500 --> 02:02.030
"Hustle!" or "Dynamite!"

02:02.100 --> 02:04.240
And I made them turn
their feelings into--

02:04.300 --> 02:06.670
- Oh, that's great.
Girl power.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.180
- Congratulations
on the game ball, guys.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.540
Maybe someday when I'm a starter
I'll get one of those, too.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.070
"Yeah, buddy, it'll happen."

02:19.150 --> 02:21.220
- Oh, yeah, right.
- Oh, yeah.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.020
- Wow, thanks, guys.

02:24.090 --> 02:26.190
- All right, so what do you
think about storing

02:26.260 --> 02:28.530
our game ball in my basement?

02:28.590 --> 02:30.990
I know a nice spot right between
the photo of me fist bumping

02:31.060 --> 02:35.270
Obama and the computer
I used to fake that photo.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.930
- That's an interesting idea.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.800
But I need something to throw at
my rooster in the morning

02:38.870 --> 02:39.970
when I wanna sleep in.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.710
Rooster's don't
have snooze buttons.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.210
- Why don't you guys leave it
somewhere you'll both see it

02:43.270 --> 02:44.600
every day?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.110
- Above the urinals
in the bathroom?

02:46.180 --> 02:47.250
- Oh, good call.

02:47.310 --> 02:48.210
- Oh, man.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.450
- No, dummies.

02:50.510 --> 02:53.340
The locker room.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.450
- That could work, too.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.850

03:36.890 --> 03:38.990
It feels like the end of an era.

03:39.060 --> 03:40.860
- Well, you may not have me
for the bake sale,

03:40.930 --> 03:45.400
but you do have...
my snicker doodles!

03:45.470 --> 03:48.540
Doodles, doodles, doodles!

03:48.610 --> 03:50.240
This bake sale is
gonna be awesome.

03:50.310 --> 03:53.480
You'll make enough money to pay
for the whole cheer retreat.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.700
I'll help you
get started right now.

03:55.780 --> 03:56.750
- Hey, that's a dollar.

03:56.810 --> 03:58.540
- Mm, this is so awesome.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.150
You need to buy
like four of these.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.190
- Bella owes one dollar.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.210
- Excuse me.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.060
- Or maybe not,
she did make them.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.620
- Excuse me, how much
are these cookies?

04:07.690 --> 04:09.590
- This is a good cause,
and we need the money.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.630
- Make up your mind.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.900
I'm trying to buy
something here.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.490
- I wanna buy something, too.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.200
Your silence.

04:17.269 --> 04:20.209
- How mean.

04:20.269 --> 04:21.640
- Can you believe that guy?

04:21.709 --> 04:23.280
I am not mean.

04:23.340 --> 04:24.110
Am I?

04:24.180 --> 04:24.910
- No.

04:24.980 --> 04:26.240
That guy is rude.

04:26.310 --> 04:27.850
Telling me to make up my mind.

04:27.910 --> 04:31.150
I have no problem
making up my mind.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.420
Or do I?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.240
- No way.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.620
Yo, which one of you cheapstakes
wants to buy a sugar cookie?

04:40.760 --> 04:44.200
- So, coach, if I keep drinking
these and put on

04:44.260 --> 04:47.370
20 pounds of pure muscle,
grow 8 to 10 inches in a month,

04:47.430 --> 04:49.200
you think I could be a starter
for the Bulldogs?

04:50.870 --> 04:52.800
You ever considered ping pong?

04:52.870 --> 04:54.540
You certainly have
the bone structure.

04:54.610 --> 04:56.010
Oh, I mean I--

04:56.070 --> 04:58.170
- Oh, look,
the bake sale's starting.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.810
Snickerdoodles here I come.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.850
- Good to see everybody's

05:03.910 --> 05:05.470
following
their workout schedule.

05:05.550 --> 05:06.990
If anyone has any questions,

05:07.050 --> 05:08.990
I took the weight-room
orientation class.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.650
- Hey, Bella,
you wanna spot me?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.460
- QB at your service.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.950
- Uh, all right,
I gotta warn you.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.000
This is the get psyched
portion of my workout so--

05:24.140 --> 05:26.540
Ow!

05:26.600 --> 05:30.300
Cardboard bruise.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.200
- Troy, I might be awhile.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.380
This machine will probably
wear out before my arms do.

05:34.450 --> 05:35.880
- Ah, no worries.

05:35.950 --> 05:38.880
It'll give the Troy more time to
practice my post-game interview.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.620
I wanna come off
as humble yet extraordinary.

05:45.390 --> 05:47.530
- Yeah, 'cause nothing says
humble like putting

05:47.590 --> 05:49.560
a "the" in front of your name.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.400
- This coming from a guy who
wears a five-pound belt buckle.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.420
We get it, you're from Texas.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.300
We all are.

05:57.370 --> 05:59.140
- Do they always
argue like this?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.400
- Well, they've always been
competitive,

06:00.470 --> 06:02.740
but things have gotten personal.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.740
- I--I guess it makes sense.

06:04.810 --> 06:06.950
Troy and Sawyer are both
playing the same position.

06:07.010 --> 06:09.980
And they both wanna be
the number-one receiver.

06:10.050 --> 06:11.680
I wonder if this is
gonna be an issue.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.180
You're a real funny guy, Troy.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.250
Funny smellin'.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.120
- I think you're
smelling my butt,

06:17.190 --> 06:19.390
because you're so slow,
you're always behind me.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.390
- So your butt smells?

06:20.460 --> 06:21.560
- Yeah.

06:21.630 --> 06:22.460
Wait.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.130
You know what I mean.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.630
- Whoa, guys, can we please
just agree

06:26.700 --> 06:29.940
that everybody's butt smells?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.540
Now let's get back
to getting buff!

06:34.310 --> 06:35.410
- Okay.

06:35.470 --> 06:36.630
I'm gonna do some sit-ups.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.680
I think I'll do about 500.

06:38.740 --> 06:40.780
- Wait, yeah,
well, I'm gonna 501.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.870
- Oh, man, this is
gonna be an issue.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.390
I've gotta do
something about this.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.220
- Bella, help.

06:49.290 --> 06:52.760
- Oops, sorry, Newt.

06:52.820 --> 06:54.450
- You saved my life.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.030
But hurt my pride.

06:59.930 --> 07:01.770
- On the other hand, if you
want sweet and salty,

07:01.830 --> 07:03.540
I'd go with
the salted caramel brownies.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.570
- Great, I'll have those.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.940
- Then again...if you just want
something salty, oh,

07:09.010 --> 07:11.010
I'd go to the vending machine
and get some barbeque chips.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.480
- Ooh, barbeque
does sound good.

07:13.540 --> 07:14.540
Thanks.

07:14.610 --> 07:17.280
- No problem.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.080
What?

07:18.150 --> 07:20.550
She just wanted some chips.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.520
- Pepper, you just
lost us a sale.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.820
You keep giving customers 30
choices, including the option

07:24.890 --> 07:26.530
to not buy anything at all.

07:26.590 --> 07:28.260
You're completely indecisive.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.460
- Well, you're mean.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.030
You made that one girl cry.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.760
- She was trying
to pay with pennies.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.430
- She was six.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.370
- Oh my gosh, I am mean.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.560
- You are.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.740
And I kinda think I might
be indecisive, maybe.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.900
- No wonder we haven't
been selling anything.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.410
- We can't handle this
at all without Bella.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.620
I need a brownie.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.020
Or a lemon square.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.140
These flavors do not blend well.

07:56.220 --> 07:59.120
- No, we can handle
this on our own.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.830
We just have to
change our approach.

08:00.890 --> 08:03.030
From now on, I'll be nice
and you'll be--

08:03.090 --> 08:05.490
- Mm, there's so many
different things I could be.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.920
A doctor, a lawyer.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.070
The president.

08:08.130 --> 08:08.600
- Pepper.

08:08.670 --> 08:09.500
- Decisive.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.870
I will be decisive.

08:14.410 --> 08:14.970
- Hey, guys.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.470
Thanks for coming.

08:16.540 --> 08:19.710
So I was thinking maybe we could
do some team-bonding exercises

08:19.780 --> 08:21.810
I used when I was cheer captain.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.580
- Okay, fine.
- That's weird.

08:23.650 --> 08:25.920
- Okay, Newt's gonna help
demonstrate the first exercise.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.440
This is a trust fall.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.320
Before you fall, tell me one
fear that you want to let go of.

08:31.390 --> 08:34.590
I'm afraid of trust falls.

08:34.659 --> 08:37.299
I feel so alive.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.000
- All right.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.059
Sawyer, you go first.

08:39.130 --> 08:40.470
Troy, you catch him.

08:40.530 --> 08:43.570
Sawyer, what's your fear?

08:43.630 --> 08:45.330
- I'm afraid of the goat man.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.910
- Yeah, I don't know
what the goat man is,

08:47.970 --> 08:51.280
but we're not doing that.

08:51.340 --> 08:53.910
- I don't know, goat man
sounds pretty scary to me.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.680
- Newt, focus.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.280
- All right, Sawyer, why don't
you talk about another fear?

08:58.350 --> 09:00.750
Maybe something team related,
like--just a thought--

09:00.820 --> 09:02.590
what y'all been
arguing about all week.

09:02.650 --> 09:03.450
- Arguing?

09:03.520 --> 09:04.520
We haven't been arguing?

09:04.590 --> 09:06.160
We're just kidding around.

09:06.220 --> 09:07.420
- Yeah, Bella, we're bros.

09:07.490 --> 09:08.990
It's what we do.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.800
- Come on, guys, I think it's
pretty obvious

09:10.860 --> 09:12.600
what's going on here.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.620
You're sharing the same position
now, and you both wanna be

09:14.700 --> 09:16.700
the number-one receiver.

09:16.770 --> 09:18.470
- Why would I be
afraid of that?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.170
I've mean a great wide receiver
for years,

09:20.240 --> 09:21.640
and I've got the game ball
to prove it.

09:21.710 --> 09:23.340
- Uh, half the game ball.

09:23.410 --> 09:24.940
And don't forget, I wasn't
even a wide receiver

09:25.010 --> 09:26.580
at the start of the season.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.070
And I already caught up to you.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.080
Next week, I'm gonna have
that game ball all to myself.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.150
Deal with it, Huggins.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.250
- Well, what if I don't
wanna deal with it?

09:34.320 --> 09:36.960
- Hey, hey, can't we just
go back to the trust falls?

09:37.020 --> 09:38.690
I'm afraid this isn't working.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.300
- I'm okay.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.530
- Okay, uh...let's try another
technique I used

09:48.600 --> 09:50.300
when I was cheer captain.

09:50.370 --> 09:54.240
Express yourself in the form
of an "I feel" statement.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.460
- Fine.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.680
I feel Troy's a jerk, and I feel
sick of him always

09:58.740 --> 09:59.880
having to be the best.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.870
- And I feel like somebody's
a big baby,

10:01.950 --> 10:03.620
just like
at peewee sleepaway camp.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.580
Sawyer pee-weed all up
in his sleeping bag.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.150
- At least I didn't cry myself
to sleep every night

10:08.220 --> 10:10.060
like Teary Troy the Blumper Boy.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.460
- Use "I feel" statements.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.390
- Fine, I feel like
my fist belongs in your face.

10:14.460 --> 10:15.360
- Oh, yeah?

10:15.430 --> 10:16.430
Well, I feel like
my foot belongs

10:16.490 --> 10:18.250
somewhere it's not polite
to talk about.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.230
- I feel like I'm gonna puke.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.000
- Argh!

10:22.070 --> 10:23.370
- Guys, stop!

10:23.430 --> 10:25.430
You're teammates,
stop it, break it up!

10:26.170 --> 10:26.870
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:26.940 --> 10:29.410
Break it up!

10:29.470 --> 10:32.430
Troy, Sawyer, get
in my office now!

10:32.510 --> 10:33.140
- But, coach--

10:33.210 --> 10:34.510
- I don't wanna hear it!

10:38.380 --> 10:39.880
- What are you
gonna do to them?

10:39.950 --> 10:41.590
- I'm suspending
them from the team.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.030
- Does anyone have an extra
toothbrush in their locker?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.790
- ♪

10:55.870 --> 10:57.100
- Coach, let me explain.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.800
It was a misunderstanding.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.000
- I know what I saw.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.740
This is a no-fight zone.

11:10.610 --> 11:12.970
- Come on, coach, they were
working out a thing,

11:13.050 --> 11:15.090
and it got a little out of hand.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.960
But they were over it
by the time you came in.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.560
Right, guys?

11:19.620 --> 11:21.650
- Uh, yeah.

11:21.730 --> 11:23.500
I'm totally over it, coach.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.860
- I was over it even
before he was over it.

11:25.930 --> 11:27.930
- Oh, yeah, well, I feel--

11:28.000 --> 11:32.140
- Anyway...coach,
you put me in charge.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.980
So why don't you trust me
on this and let me lead?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.250
Also I can wash your
car for you later.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.180
- Well, I mean, it would be
a shame to suspend

11:42.250 --> 11:44.050
my two best receivers
for a little--

11:44.110 --> 11:46.110
- Thing that will
never happen again.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.280
I personally guarantee it.

11:48.350 --> 11:49.990
Trust me.

11:50.050 --> 11:50.910
Show 'em.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.320
Hug it out.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.990
See?

12:00.060 --> 12:01.320
Okay, that's enough.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.600
- Get out, get out.

12:02.670 --> 12:05.840
Get out, before
I change my mind.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.730
Dawson?

12:08.940 --> 12:10.610
It's the white SUV.

12:10.670 --> 12:13.170
It has a bumper sticker
"I brake for snickerdoodles."

12:18.850 --> 12:20.190
- That was close.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.890
But at least I got you
guys out of that mess.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.250
Now let's work this out.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.690
- Look, I've already
worked it out.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.130
If you don't make me the
number-one receiver tomorrow,

12:27.190 --> 12:28.460
I quit.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.890
- And if you don't make me
the number-one receiver,

12:29.960 --> 12:30.730
then I quit.

12:30.790 --> 12:31.550
- What?

12:31.630 --> 12:33.600
I--I can't choose between you.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.190
- Come on, Newt, we're
going to the Starcade.

12:35.270 --> 12:36.470
- No, Newt, come with me.

12:36.530 --> 12:37.760
We'll play video
games at my house.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.140
- Newt, you're
coming with me, right?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.700
No, he's
coming with me.

12:40.770 --> 12:41.710
- Newt!

12:41.770 --> 12:42.870
- Newt!

12:42.940 --> 12:44.780
- Oh, no, I already
have divorced parents.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.180
I can't have divorced
best friends.

12:47.410 --> 12:48.950
Who's gonna
get my on Christmas?

12:49.010 --> 12:52.050
- Oh, whatever, Newt.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.490
- Look, this isn't ideal, but
don't worry, I'm gonna fix this

12:55.550 --> 12:57.490
just like I did
at cheerleading camp.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.610
- No offense, Bella, but
this isn't cheerleading.

12:59.690 --> 13:02.730
You can't just wave some pompoms
around and then abra-caba-sho-ba

13:02.790 --> 13:04.520
and everything's fine.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.000
- Look, you have no idea
what I dealt with on cheer.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.660
How's this for a problem?

13:08.730 --> 13:11.640
Seven teenage girls
and one Katy Perry ticket.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.340
I solved that, and only
one girl got stitches.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.330
Look, you can barely
even see the scar.

13:18.410 --> 13:20.980
The point is, I can handle this.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.170
- I hope you're right.

13:22.250 --> 13:25.150
I don't have anything
left to barf.

13:26.250 --> 13:30.090
Maybe I do!

13:30.150 --> 13:33.110
- ♪

13:34.360 --> 13:35.990

13:36.060 --> 13:37.500
I'm nice.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.060
Hey, welcome to the bake sale.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.260
- Mm, what do you
think I should get?

13:48.340 --> 13:49.710
- A brownie.

13:49.770 --> 13:50.730
- I don't know,
I'm kinda feeling--

13:50.810 --> 13:51.780
- I've decided.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.280
You'll have a brownie.

13:53.340 --> 13:54.340
- No, but I think maybe--

13:54.410 --> 13:56.180
- That'll be one dollar.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.020
- I gotta get to class.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.280
- I didn't hear the bell ring.

13:58.350 --> 14:02.250
- Yeah, neither did I.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.860
- I don't get it.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.660
We're being the opposite of
ourselves,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.690
and the sale
is even more of a disaster.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.160
- The sale's almost over.

14:09.230 --> 14:10.530
And the only thing
in that cashbox

14:10.590 --> 14:14.520
is a receipt for the cashbox.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.400
We won't be able
to go on the retreat.

14:16.470 --> 14:19.040
- The girls won't be happy.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.740
They'll replace us as captains
because we'll be responsible

14:21.810 --> 14:23.680
for the first-ever
bake sale fail.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.040
- We can't fail.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.380
We have to try harder.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.370
We can do this.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.220
I have an idea.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.150
Buy a cupcake, get a free hug.

14:36.290 --> 14:40.160

not a hug!

14:48.200 --> 14:49.930

14:50.000 --> 14:52.340
- I know you were mad
yesterday fighting with Sawyer.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.140
But I also know you love
football more than anything.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.180
So why don't you put this
silly fight aside

14:58.240 --> 15:00.350

me number-one receiver?

number-one receiver...

15:05.980 --> 15:06.940
every other day.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.350
See, I made a schedule.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.660
Monday's Troy, Tuesday's
Sawyer, Wednesday Troy again.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.960
Sawyer, look what I got you.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.570
A new belt buckle.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.530
- Oh, it has
a number one on it.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.500
Does that mean
I'm the number-one receiver?

receiver...of this belt buckle.

you are good, Bella.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.680
- Does this mean you're
coming back to the team?

15:33.740 --> 15:36.340
- No, it means I have a hat
that'll look great with this.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.240
- Troy, I've decided.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.760
If you come back to the team,

15:43.820 --> 15:46.860
I'm making you

you're telling the truth.

15:49.390 --> 15:50.890

are crossed behind your back.

Walk away, see if I care.

football, Bella.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.540
It's about friendship.

- Do it fast, Bella.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.440
Ever since they broke up, I've
been having nightmares

17:19.520 --> 17:21.349
about the goat man.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.359
His hairy legs, his horns

17:24.420 --> 17:28.060

17:30.130 --> 17:32.060
We're even worse at selling

But we also have five other
options that are all so good.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.580

for allowance, princess.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.560
- Fine.

18:04.030 --> 18:05.260
- Did that just happen?

18:05.330 --> 18:06.430
- We made a sale.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.370
And we did as our old selves.

18:09.430 --> 18:10.700
- We didn't need to change.

18:10.770 --> 18:14.370
We just needed to be
totally flawed together.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.210
- Hey, you look like
you're in the mood

18:16.270 --> 18:17.670
for some peanut butter balls.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.380
Or perhaps some
butterscotch cookies.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.780
Or salted chocolate squares.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.850
- They all sound great.

18:22.910 --> 18:24.210
Do you have change for a ten?

18:24.280 --> 18:26.820
- Nope, have a nice day.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.840
- Thank you.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.490
- Bye-bye now.

18:30.550 --> 18:32.580
- ♪

18:33.990 --> 18:36.460
- All right, guys, I understand
that only one of you

18:36.530 --> 18:38.060
can be the number-one receiver.

18:38.130 --> 18:41.570
And the other will never
play on this team again.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.900
I'm deciding who stays and who
goes through a test

18:43.970 --> 18:46.140
of mental strength
and endurance.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.730
Whichever one of you can keep
his hand on the ball the longest

18:48.810 --> 18:50.710
will be my number one.

18:50.770 --> 18:52.330
- This is how you're choosing?

18:52.410 --> 18:53.440
- This is so lame.

18:53.510 --> 18:55.050
- The challenge starts now.

18:55.110 --> 18:57.750
You're going down!

18:57.810 --> 18:59.610
- Man, this is gonna be easy.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.280
And when I win, I'm gonna
do my victory dance.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.720
Here's a little preview.

19:03.790 --> 19:04.720
Go, Troy.

19:04.790 --> 19:05.860
Go, Troy.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.330
Go, Troy.

19:07.390 --> 19:09.990
- Calm down, Beyoncé.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.600
Here's what a real
touchdown dance looks like.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.790
The Huggin Shuffle.

19:19.870 --> 19:20.670
- Is that a dance or are you
just trying

19:20.740 --> 19:22.610
to pull your pants up?

19:22.670 --> 19:25.040
- Don't get mad
'cause you got served.

19:25.110 --> 19:25.780
- What?

19:25.840 --> 19:26.580
Oh, no, you got served.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.170
What's up?

19:27.240 --> 19:28.270
Bring it.

19:28.350 --> 19:30.010
- Okay.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.920
While you guys are serving and
whatnot, I'm gonna set up

19:34.990 --> 19:37.960
a little visual presentation.

19:38.020 --> 19:42.590
It starts at the peewee football
camp where you first met.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.700
- Look, there's you
peewee sleeping bag

19:44.760 --> 19:47.200
BP--before pee-pee.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.970
But actually, Troy, your mom,
who I got these pictures from,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
told me that when Sawyer had
his accident,

19:55.110 --> 19:59.810
you shared your sleeping bag
with him.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.410
- My mom is a liar.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.780
- And when all the other
campers were making fun of Troy,

20:04.850 --> 20:07.590
calling him
"Teary Troy the Blumper Boy,"

20:07.650 --> 20:11.920
there was only one person
who stood up for him.

20:11.990 --> 20:14.230
- Oh, no, no, I--I got that
because I got in a fight

20:14.290 --> 20:18.560
with the local...bear.

20:18.630 --> 20:20.060
- Bella, give it up, okay?

20:20.130 --> 20:21.970
You're not gonna trick us into
getting over this

20:22.030 --> 20:24.600
by showing us some sappy
pictures from our childhood.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.240
- Oh, okay.

20:26.300 --> 20:31.530
Then I guess there's no point in
showing you this last picture.

20:31.610 --> 20:34.150
- That was the day you asked
me to be your best friend.

20:34.210 --> 20:36.580
- And that was the day
you said yes.

20:36.650 --> 20:37.750
- See?

20:37.810 --> 20:39.110
What's more important?

20:39.180 --> 20:43.690
Being number-one receiver
or this beautiful bromance?

20:43.750 --> 20:47.010
I think you know the answer.

20:47.090 --> 20:48.430
- Um, Bella--

20:48.490 --> 20:49.860
Bella, I'm not saying

20:49.930 --> 20:51.200
that this worked or anything,
but could you please

20:51.260 --> 20:54.600
step outside so I can say
something to Sawyer?

20:54.660 --> 20:56.920
- Take all the time you need.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.740
Look, I'm sorry, bro.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.100
You're my friend.

21:01.170 --> 21:03.070
And football shouldn't
get in the way of that.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.640
- No, I'm sorry.

21:04.710 --> 21:05.780
You just started playing
receiver,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.580
and you're already
awesome at it.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.400
I was just jealous.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.050
- It's all good.

21:11.110 --> 21:12.770
Hey, you're
top drawer in my book, chap.

21:12.850 --> 21:16.250
Likewise, governor.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.190
- I knew this would work.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.610
Oooh!

21:19.690 --> 21:22.090
Happy to
be of service, old governors.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.800
- ♪

21:33.640 --> 21:36.710
Pheeeeeeh.

21:43.550 --> 21:44.750
Uh!

21:44.810 --> 21:46.340
Uh, I did it!

21:46.420 --> 21:47.550
I'm buff.

21:47.620 --> 21:49.650
I'm finally buff.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.490
Wait, what do I do now?

21:52.560 --> 21:53.860
Oh, oh.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.650
No, no, no, no, no.

Ow!
