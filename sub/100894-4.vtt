Still waters, Mr. Maddox?

01:22.457 --> 01:23.458
Sorry, what?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.961
Morning, man, and I do mean good
given the night you just had.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.214
What the hell are you talking about?

01:29.297 --> 01:31.382
-[chuckles]
-And how did you get Mrs. Alcott in on it?

01:31.466 --> 01:33.134
You still afraid to use her first name?

01:33.218 --> 01:35.095
-What is it?
-I have no idea.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.222
But Carla told me
what you were up to last night.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What does your wife think she knows?

01:39.140 --> 01:41.142
She heard from her sister
who heard from Mary Vaughn

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
who happened to drop by
at just the right moment--

01:43.103 --> 01:43.937
Heard what?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.980
That you and Maddie Townsend were, uh...

01:46.064 --> 01:47.065
How did she word it? Uh...

01:47.148 --> 01:48.066
Canoodling.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.151
-For the love of God.
-Yep.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.945
-That's not what happened at all.
-On the front porch in front of God

01:52.028 --> 01:52.862
and Mary Vaughn.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.114
What's the big deal, all right?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.949
It's an oral presentation.
You can fake half of it

01:56.032 --> 01:57.325
as long as you do it with style.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.078
You could. I don't do
the whole talking in front of class thing.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.038
Should I apologize
for taking all the charisma in the family?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.916
Kyle! If I don't pass this,
I'm on academic probation from the team.

02:04.999 --> 02:05.834
I need your help.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.461
Say that again for posterity.

02:09.212 --> 02:13.675
Coach saw your mom's posterity last night.
[laughs]

02:13.758 --> 02:15.093
It's not even what that means.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.720
What was he talking about, anyways?

02:19.347 --> 02:20.265
I'll see ya.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.224
Hey.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.937
[Helen] Tom, you do not have a case.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.773
Your client claims wrongful termination,

02:28.857 --> 02:30.859
but he was quite rightfully terminated.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.860
Prove it.

02:31.943 --> 02:32.861
Quiet.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.823
We all know that your claim is meaningless
without evidence.

02:36.906 --> 02:41.202
Our witness will testify
to seeing your client remove,

02:41.286 --> 02:42.495
without authorization,

02:42.579 --> 02:45.498
several bottles of high-end whiskey
from the restaurant.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.711
The value of those bottles
reaches near a thousand dollars,

02:49.794 --> 02:51.754
and that is petty larceny.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.301
-It's a misdemeanor.
-It's jail time,

02:56.843 --> 02:58.970
or at the very least a substantial fine

02:59.053 --> 03:00.930
which your client may be
hard-pressed to pay

03:01.014 --> 03:02.307
given his lack of employment.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.476
[Tom sighs]

03:07.937 --> 03:08.813
Drop the suit.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.065
And we don't press charges.

03:11.774 --> 03:15.737
We'd also like to see your client
seek treatment for his drinking problem.

03:16.821 --> 03:20.033
That, however, is a request
and not a demand.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.037
-Screw you!
-Whoa!

03:26.623 --> 03:29.959
You know, the only problem
is having to listen to this bullshit.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.754
[exhales]

03:34.005 --> 03:36.424
I apologize for my client's outburst.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.093
I'm sure he will find the terms amenable.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.640
I'll be in touch, Helen.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.269
God bless Isaac for coming forward,

03:48.728 --> 03:50.813
and you were fretting
that your staff doesn't like you.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.607
[scoffs] Yeah.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.568
[sighs]

03:57.278 --> 04:00.073
So I told her, "I don't want to take you
to the restaurant where I work,"

04:00.156 --> 04:01.532
and then she was all like, "Oh--"

04:01.616 --> 04:03.493
Are we working, or are we chatting?

04:03.576 --> 04:04.452
Working, Chef.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.752
It's a madhouse out there.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.797
Yes, thank you
for that brand-new information.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.842
I'm getting my lunch to go.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.137
Niçoise, madam,

04:24.430 --> 04:25.848
and a treat for dessert.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.016
Thank you.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.982
You all right, Dana Sue?
You look a little flushed.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.693
Well, I'm in a hot kitchen,
if you haven't noticed.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.403
Dana Sue, I'm just worried about you.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.862
Okay, stop fussing! I'm fine!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.199
Dana Sue!

04:43.283 --> 04:45.159
-[Erik] Hey, give me space.
-[man] Is she okay?

04:45.243 --> 04:46.786
Somebody turn off that burner.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.455
[Helen] Dana Sue.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.749
Isaac, stockpot,

04:53.418 --> 04:54.502
under her feet.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.838
[Helen] What's wrong with her?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.256
What's wrong with her?

05:00.842 --> 05:03.594
Helen, call 911. Now.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.512
[Helen sobs]

05:11.311 --> 05:15.231
Now I know at least one of you can tell me
the key elements of the Marshall Plan.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.905
Let me remind you that participation
is still ten percent of your grade

05:23.781 --> 05:25.199
and that some of you need it.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.951
So let's see some hands.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.328
[knock at door]

05:29.996 --> 05:32.415
Hi, um, I'm here for Annie Sullivan.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.254
[indistinct announcement over PA]

05:43.509 --> 05:46.262
Hi. I just want to say thank you.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.222
-For what?
-Well, knowin' what to do.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.767
Dana Sue's gonna be okay because of you.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.352
[exhales, sniffs]

05:52.769 --> 05:53.603
How's she doing?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.272
Oh, they're, uh, running tests

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
and more tests

05:58.441 --> 06:00.526
and other tests. I don't know.

06:00.943 --> 06:01.819
That's good.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.698
When, uh...

06:06.532 --> 06:07.992
When Dana Sue went down,

06:08.076 --> 06:12.747
you, uh, knew exactly...
exactly what to do.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.625
And when the EMTs arrived,

06:15.708 --> 06:18.461
you were rattling off information

06:18.544 --> 06:21.255
and vitals and Lord knows what else.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.424
Where on earth did you learn all that?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.136
[chuckles] Um...

06:28.221 --> 06:30.681
General Hospital
was my grandmama's favorite

06:30.765 --> 06:31.974
when I was growing up.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.269
I'm gonna go open the kitchen back up.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.106
Let me know once you know something.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.732
Anything.

06:40.858 --> 06:41.859
Of course.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.029
Get off my purse,
and hand me my phone right this second.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.072
No, ma'am.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.157
Well, I'm not staying, so...

06:49.450 --> 06:50.493
Sit down, please.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.662
You have another hour on that IV.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.580
No, I can't spend that kind of time.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.416
I gotta get back to the restaurant.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.167
Howie, come on.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.421
Now, it's very sweet of you to come 
all the way down here to check on me--

07:01.504 --> 07:03.631
I was called in
as your general practitioner,

07:04.048 --> 07:06.008
-whom you rarely see.
-[scoffs]

07:06.092 --> 07:08.010
Annie, give your mama and me a minute.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.554
I want to stay, Dr. Young.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.476
Annie and I don't have secrets, Howie,
and this is no big deal.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.021
Dana Sue,
you had a hyperglycemic emergency.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.983
You have a genetic predisposition
to insulin issues.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.943
If you don't get your blood sugar
under control,

07:24.026 --> 07:26.821
you're gonna be dealing
with type 2 diabetes, like your mother.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.573
You have to do what he says, Mom.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.409
We'll start with a series
of glucose tolerance tests

07:31.492 --> 07:32.785
to establish a baseline

07:32.869 --> 07:34.620
and we'll develop a treatment plan
from there,

07:35.246 --> 07:36.289
but, Dana Sue,

07:36.831 --> 07:39.208
the essential element is your cooperation.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.588
You got it.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.423
[Howie] All right.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.507
All right.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.592
I'm serious.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.594
Watch your mother.

07:53.014 --> 07:53.848
[sighs]

07:56.726 --> 07:57.602
Maddie.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.312
Hey.

07:59.729 --> 08:03.024
Uh, coffee from Wharton's,
poured by Ms. Grace herself.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.445
-Thought you could use a pick-me-up.
-I certainly could. Thank you.

08:09.947 --> 08:10.865
How's Dana Sue?

08:12.074 --> 08:13.326
She's doing better.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.370
That's good.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.664
It was nice of you to come down here.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.169
Well, to be honest, I didn't...

08:23.711 --> 08:25.630
come just to check on her.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.507
Um...

08:28.758 --> 08:31.093
You may have heard, but there are some...

08:32.011 --> 08:34.263
rumors going around.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.766
Welcome to Serenity,

08:37.141 --> 08:40.686
where we all know each other's business
for good or for ill.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.397
[chuckles]
Except there isn't any business.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.525
I was fixing your sink.

08:46.817 --> 08:50.404
If this is your first brush
with how tongues wag around here,

08:50.821 --> 08:51.906
congratulations.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.950
You've been here since September.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.077
That actually might be
some sort of record.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.120
Okay, well, uh,
how do you wanna handle this?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.664
There's nothing to handle,

09:00.498 --> 09:02.833
unless you keep changing clothes
in my driveway.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.418
It was a shirt.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.129
Don't worry.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.467
By dinner, everyone'll have moved on 
to Dana Sue having the bubonic plague

09:11.551 --> 09:13.052
and we'll be fine.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.262
[chuckles]

09:15.513 --> 09:17.682
There's nothing wrong
with us being friends.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.851
Friends.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.272
Okay.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.692
Here's to friendship.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.777
Yes.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.458
I'm driving you home or what?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.043
Uh, yeah, thanks.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.337
Sorry, it's been a weird day.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.507
I bet. Heard my folks talking
about the whole thing last night.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
And my mom said after everything
that your mom's been through,

09:53.676 --> 09:55.261
you know,
she deserves a chance to be happy.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.346
You driving, or you trying to be Dr. Phil?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.807
Hey, man. Dr. Phil makes bank, all right?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.397
Annie, what are you doing?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.899
Dr. Young said that you need to watch
your sugar intake.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.861
It'll be a lot easier
if none of this is in the house.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.613
What are you planning on eating?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.990
There's tons of Paleo recipes
on Pinterest.

10:16.073 --> 10:16.907
I'll figure it out.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.034
Okay, look. Look.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.619
I know, today was scary,

10:19.702 --> 10:22.371
but you are overreacting, okay?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.249
And I am an adult,
and I'm perfectly capable

10:25.333 --> 10:27.001
of watching my sugar intake

10:27.084 --> 10:28.794
without any help from you, okay?

10:28.878 --> 10:31.505
So as usual, you're perfect,
and everybody else is wrong.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.091
-No, Annie, that--
-[Helen] Knock, knock.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.304
-Y'all in the middle of something?
-[Annie] No, it's fine.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.639
I'll clean this up later.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.145
She's worried, and I was not gracious.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.730
It's fine.

10:48.147 --> 10:52.026
Y'all didn't have to go to Egret Falls
to pick up Thai food.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.235
How'd you know it was Thai?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.154
Chef's nose?

10:55.237 --> 10:57.239
Well, seems like Bangkok Palace

10:57.323 --> 10:59.700
is the only place
that you don't complain about.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.911
Hey, I never complain.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.329
[Helen] Okay.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.415
Let us-- Let us just give thanks...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.459
-Helen.
-...that you are safe at home

11:08.542 --> 11:10.044
-[scoffs, clears throat]
-because, Lord forgive me

11:10.127 --> 11:13.673
there was a moment this morning
where I didn't... I didn't know.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.549
God bless Erik Whitley.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.968
You're acting like I was on death's door.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.680
I had a bad moment. I'm fine.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.848
Okay, yes, but it was still serious.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.352
I mean,
especially given all the... givens.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.562
-Because diabetes killed my mother.
-[Maddie] Well...

11:28.646 --> 11:32.775
Look. Honestly, I get the gravity. Okay?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.902
And thank you for worrying about me,

11:34.985 --> 11:38.698
but can we please just
worry about dinner right now?

11:38.781 --> 11:39.615
Yes, ma'am.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.575
-Of course. Mm.
-[Dana Sue] Thank you.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.370
I'd use more lemongrass.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.539
[snickers]

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
That is an opinion, not a complaint!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.419
-No, of course.
-[laughs]

11:51.502 --> 11:52.545
Yah!

11:52.628 --> 11:55.673
[stammers] Hold on, okay,
I genuinely need you to tell me...

11:57.174 --> 11:58.551
how you're a Pirates fan.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.635
Oh, um...

12:00.052 --> 12:02.471
Let's see. When I was six,
I thought pirates were cool.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.474
-All right.
-And, uh, now I'm an adult, and, uh...

12:06.058 --> 12:08.269
pirates are still cool.
What's there to discuss?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.521
How deeply concerned I am
that you don't have better taste.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.606
In fact, you owe me a drink
for making me watch soccer.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.692
This is the world's game.
Do not denigrate the name.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.777
What? No.
But baseball's America's pastime.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.614
I am so sorry to bother y'all,
but you're Cal Maddox, right?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.368
Yes, he is.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.286
I knew it.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.370
-[chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.748
I just have to tell you that I adore you.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.458
I mean, as a ballplayer.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.209
Uh, that's very kind of you.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.295
You were my favorite player
your first season with the Braves.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.589
I was getting my engineering degree
at Emory,

12:36.672 --> 12:39.049
and I watched every home game I could.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.719
I must have seen you play,
what, a dozen times.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.514
You were, uh, easily the best looking guy
on the roster...

12:45.598 --> 12:47.975
-[chokes]
-...and the best rookie at bat.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.521
It broke my heart
when you had to leave baseball.

12:53.731 --> 12:54.940
Yeah.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.359
It would be an honor to buy you a drink.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.489
Thank you, but my friend here

13:01.989 --> 13:03.199
already owes me a drink

13:03.282 --> 13:07.495
and by the look of things,
a few more rounds of trash talking.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.206
Of course. [chuckles]

13:10.915 --> 13:13.501
Not to trouble you further,
but can I please get a selfie?

13:13.584 --> 13:16.378
Just to prove to myself
that this actually happened?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.214
-Yeah, of course.
-[girl laughs]

13:19.548 --> 13:21.967
-All right. Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.261
One, two... One more?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.346
[camera shutter clicks]

13:27.014 --> 13:27.932
Thank you so much.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.975
You're more than welcome.
You have a lovely evening.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.560
[girl] Okay. See you around.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.686
Come by anytime.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.107
Brother, she's smart, she's gorgeous,

13:37.191 --> 13:40.110
she digs baseball,
and she's into your mediocre mug.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.071
She's basically the perfect woman.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.031
Maybe, but not for me.

13:45.783 --> 13:46.742
Yeah.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.583
-Uh...
-Hey. TV?

13:54.667 --> 13:55.584
[stammers] This is homework.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.837
I'm trying to see as many interpretations
of Puck as possible,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.255
and, yes, I put Katie to bed.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.131
Okay, good. Did you brush her teeth?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.800
I put her to bed.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.594
[sighs]

14:06.804 --> 14:07.930
It's basically empty.

14:10.641 --> 14:11.517
How's Ms. Dana Sue?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.811
She gave us a good scare,
but she'll be fine.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.230
That's good.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.149
Annie's doing fine too
if that's what you were gonna ask.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.609
I wasn't, but that's great.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.610
Whose are those?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.404
-[Tyler] Kyle's.
-Kyle.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.322
[Tyler] My coach, Mom?

14:26.615 --> 14:27.575
Really?

14:28.784 --> 14:31.287
-What in God's name are you talking about?
-It's all over school.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.330
[laughs]

14:33.914 --> 14:37.084
He came over to fix the sink.
Tyler, you were here. You saw him.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.377
I don't know what I saw!

14:39.044 --> 14:40.045
People are talking.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.089
Look, Mom, if you want to date...

14:42.172 --> 14:43.382
Ew. Fine, whatever!

14:44.049 --> 14:47.177
But why couldn't you have literally picked
anyone else in this stupid town?

14:47.720 --> 14:50.180
[scoffs] People just stopped talking
about Dad, now I have to deal with this?

14:50.264 --> 14:51.765
I know, I know, and I'm sorry,

14:52.266 --> 14:54.894
but there is nothing going on
between me and Coach Maddox,

14:56.604 --> 14:58.022
and if that changes,

14:59.189 --> 15:00.274
you will be the first to know.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.742
Kyle, get your dishes.

15:12.161 --> 15:12.995
[sighs]

15:13.078 --> 15:14.079
Mommy!

15:14.163 --> 15:17.124
You are supposed to be asleep, Baby Bean.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.711
I waited
so you could say my prayers with me.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.838
Well, then, I feel special.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.382
Dear God,

15:26.050 --> 15:28.218
please bless me and Mommy

15:28.302 --> 15:30.638
and Daddy and Ty and Kyle

15:30.721 --> 15:33.390
and Nana and Meemaw and Pop-Pop,

15:33.849 --> 15:37.561
and please bless Ms. Belanger
and everyone else at school,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.940
and please bless Becca's bunny
with the broken foot,

15:41.565 --> 15:44.735
and please, God, please fix my family.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.113
Amen. Good night, Mommy.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.876
Good to hear Dana Sue's doing all right.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.086
Been praying for her.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.003
Yeah...

16:03.587 --> 16:05.547
she'll be grateful to hear that, I bet.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.550
-Mm.
-And she'll also be really grateful

16:08.634 --> 16:11.387
to get a handle
on where we are with these repairs.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.930
[Maddie] Mm. Subtle.

16:13.722 --> 16:17.601
It'll be tight, but so long 
as there's no more big hiccups,

16:18.018 --> 16:22.314
we might just have a snowball's chance
of finishing on time.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.565
Morning, y'all.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.694
Oh, Mary Vaughn,
what an undeserved pleasure.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.322
I don't know what you think you're doing,
but it has got to stop.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.700
And, uh, who do you think you are?

16:33.117 --> 16:33.993
Ryan.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.663
Um...

16:38.080 --> 16:40.332
Skeeter, you remember Ryan Wingate.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.501
Ms. Frances' nephew...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.796
who hasn't visited in a long while.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.507
I have to say this is a surprise.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.676
As big a surprise as learning
you're tearing up my aunt's house,

16:50.759 --> 16:53.262
and no one bothered
to get my thoughts on the matter. Hm?

16:53.345 --> 16:56.140
Well, given the fact
that she sold it to us outright,

16:56.223 --> 16:58.559
it is quite literally
none of your business.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.769
Ryan, have you spoken to Ms. Frances?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.604
She told me she didn't want to discuss it.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.898
The poor dear is clearly distressed.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.066
[laughs] The poor dear!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.235
The poor dear who could,

17:08.318 --> 17:11.572
by the way, still chew you up
and spit you out,

17:11.655 --> 17:15.784
was delighted to entrust this house
to people who care about its history.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.661
If you cared,
you wouldn't be tearing it down.

17:17.745 --> 17:18.871
Renovating it!

17:19.371 --> 17:21.707
Speaking of, I'll get back to work.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.624
Thank you, Skeeter.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
Well, you can't because I am petitioning

17:24.543 --> 17:27.254
to have this declared
a historic structure.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.339
-A what?
-You are joking!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.468
While the City Council considers
Mr. Wingate's petition,

17:32.551 --> 17:33.844
there can be no more construction

17:33.927 --> 17:37.014
that alters the original character
of the house,

17:37.097 --> 17:39.641
which, of course,
halts y'all's project here.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.313
After all, we have to consider what's best
for the future of Serenity.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.443
I don't know what
the mayor's little lady told you,

17:49.526 --> 17:52.821
but every step of our approach
to this project

17:53.238 --> 17:56.116
has been with respect to this house
and to your aunt

17:56.200 --> 17:58.118
who we see on an almost daily basis

17:58.202 --> 18:01.538
-because we don't live in San Francisco.
-I cared enough to come, didn't I?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.418
Or maybe you would care enough

18:06.502 --> 18:08.796
to allow me to show you
our business plans.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.756
I can answer all your questions then.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.800
-[Mary] I've got a showing--
-I can handle it...

18:14.134 --> 18:15.677
but I doubt I'll be persuaded.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.807
-The Ryan?
-Yep.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.310
You know he didn't come
all this way for the house.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.229
-He came for you.
-[Helen] That is crazy.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.190
Why do you act like it's impossible?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.484
First love never truly goes away.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.738
You guys always had my definition
of great romance.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.698
Stealing kisses,

18:37.241 --> 18:38.283
sneaking around.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.537
Summertime when he was here
visiting Ms. Frances.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.413
-I was there. Thank you very much.
-Okay.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.456
Yeah, sneaking around

18:44.540 --> 18:47.709
'cause Ryan's daddy couldn't stand
a Wingate dating a black girl.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.378
You can stop at any time.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.672
There was always that hint of destiny,

18:51.755 --> 18:53.048
how you kept finding each other.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.633
College.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.051
San Francisco.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.263
Which they wouldn't have had to do
if he didn't keep taking off

18:59.721 --> 19:01.348
and breaking poor Helen's heart.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.017
Whoa, whoa.
[stammers] There's no poor Helen.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.436
It was a long time ago,
and it was fine, just fine.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.605
Except the part
where he's threatening the spa.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.482
And that will be fine, too.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.651
-You're sure about that?
-Yes.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
Our business plan's rock solid.

19:15.487 --> 19:19.032
[stammers] We're barely changing
the exterior of the house

19:19.116 --> 19:22.578
and most importantly,
[stammers] Ms. Frances is on board.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.915
Okay. Then why are you so fluttery?

19:27.541 --> 19:29.126
'Cause she's gonna go see Ryan.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.503
Just the two of you. Private meeting.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.880
I have a deposition.

19:33.463 --> 19:37.384
You two can feel free to continue
this little Tiger Beat meeting without me.

19:39.845 --> 19:40.929
[chuckles]

19:48.854 --> 19:49.897
Oh, hey.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.565
Hey, uh, Maddie.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.610
-Hey.
-Hey, uh, you got a second?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.487
Yeah. Half a one.
What's-- What's going on?

19:57.571 --> 20:00.532
Well, I've been thinking,
um, about what you said,

20:01.325 --> 20:02.659
you and I being friends,

20:03.827 --> 20:05.412
and I have one problem.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.750
I don't want to be friends.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.877
I want more than that,

20:12.377 --> 20:15.339
and you are beautiful and kind

20:15.422 --> 20:16.632
and interesting

20:17.507 --> 20:20.928
and I couldn't care less
what people say or think about us.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.473
Now I know things
are a little more complicated on your end,

20:26.141 --> 20:28.143
but I really think
we got a shot at something.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.898
That is if you are interested.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.818
I don't quite know what to say.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.241
And I totally respect that.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.245
I just thought you should know
where I stand.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.799
[Helen] Our crew is, uh, very experienced
in converting older houses into businesses

20:59.341 --> 21:01.176
while retaining the character.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.887
And most of the crew is local,

21:04.346 --> 21:06.848
and so they love this place
as much as we do...

21:07.849 --> 21:09.851
and they're showing it in their work.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.562
Mrs. Lewis painted
a very different picture

21:12.646 --> 21:14.815
about... what y'all were doing here.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.400
Of course she did. I--

21:16.942 --> 21:19.695
I was a part of scrapping one
of her pet projects a little while ago,

21:19.778 --> 21:20.946
so this is payback.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.448
I'm sorry to hear that...

21:23.532 --> 21:24.366
Hm.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.659
...but I'm glad she called.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.997
Ryan, we, um...

21:31.123 --> 21:32.207
We all love your aunt,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.376
and we are committed
to making this project

21:34.459 --> 21:36.336
one that honors her legacy--

21:36.420 --> 21:37.754
You should have called me.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.672
Why?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.966
You know what this house,
the time I spent there,

21:41.049 --> 21:42.426
what that means to me.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.762
-You couldn't pick up the phone?
-It is not your house.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.432
I know you and Ms. Frances
were close once,

21:48.515 --> 21:50.475
but you haven't set foot in Serenity in--

21:50.559 --> 21:52.602
Fourteen years. Believe me, I know.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.480
And I thought you didn't care.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.190
About the house or about us?

21:57.274 --> 21:59.318
Six of one, half dozen the other.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.914
-About your petition--
-I'll get back to you.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.834
I got more thinking to do.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.128
Huh.

22:20.797 --> 22:21.757
[sighs]

22:24.426 --> 22:25.802
What on earth were you thinking?

22:25.886 --> 22:28.513
I was thinking of you.
I figured something had to be wrong

22:28.597 --> 22:30.390
for them to get you to give up the house.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.810
You are so full of nonsense,
I can see it leaking out your ears.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.312
No, ma'am, Aunt Frances.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.105
If I had sold it to anyone else,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.066
you would not so much
as raised an eyebrow.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.694
You came flying back here
because I sold it to Helen Decatur.

22:43.111 --> 22:46.031
I gotta tell ya, you shutting down
the girl's brand-new business

22:46.114 --> 22:48.158
is not the best way back into her heart.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.451
This is not about Helen.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.495
I wanted to check on you.
Am I not allowed to miss you?

22:51.578 --> 22:52.662
[chuckles] Oh.

22:52.746 --> 22:57.042
Please. You've missed me
to the tune of a Christmas card

22:57.125 --> 22:59.336
and a birthday card for plenty of years.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.839
You would have been just fine
missing me a little longer.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.591
Why are you wasting time denying it?

23:04.674 --> 23:08.095
It's Helen Decatur you're after,
and you're going about it like an idiot.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.895
Ugh, stop shooting me
those puppy dog eyes,

23:16.978 --> 23:18.522
and get the pork chops on the griddle.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.650
We're all just worried about you.
Have you eaten today?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.612
No, because I am fasting
for another Dr. Young test,

23:25.695 --> 23:27.864
and I can take care of myself, all right?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.742
Don't need you poking at me
every 30 seconds.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.078
Table 12 would like to speak
to someone in charge.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.580
They're unhappy with the shrimp and grits.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.790
Of course they are.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.917
-Mom, you okay? Have--
-Okay.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.293
Just stop!

23:44.464 --> 23:47.342
Chef, I need you take a look at something.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.221
All right. Let's go. [sighs]

23:57.477 --> 23:59.688
-Is something on your mind?
-With all due respect,

23:59.771 --> 24:01.773
I've never heard you rail on Annie
like that.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.943
-You're over the line.
-Chef, Dana Sue,

24:06.236 --> 24:09.114
please, it just tells me
there's something wrong.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.492
You're not letting Helen
or Maddie help you.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.910
You're not letting Annie help you,

24:13.994 --> 24:15.662
and I got a feeling you won't let me help.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.789
Because I don't need it.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.041
Look, all I know is,

24:20.709 --> 24:22.085
I've walked through some valleys.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.962
I thought I could do it alone,

24:24.546 --> 24:25.464
and I couldn't.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.716
And you shouldn't be trying to either.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.676
I'm fine.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.136
We're swamped.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.305
-I know.
-Yeah, you've been ill,

24:33.889 --> 24:35.056
and you'll make yourself worse

24:35.140 --> 24:36.892
if you keep trying
to do it all by yourself.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.728
You don't have to talk to me,

24:40.395 --> 24:41.605
but talk to someone.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.024
Lay down your burden

24:44.900 --> 24:46.485
before you drive people away.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.616
Anything else?

24:55.785 --> 24:57.245
That's the last of the pork chops.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.501
Well, then I guess
we better get back in there

25:02.584 --> 25:03.710
and cook some chicken.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.088
Plus, the last thing I need
is people whispering about us

25:07.172 --> 25:08.465
being back here whispering.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.678
Okay. Prynne is the protaganist.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.640
Ty. Ty, you're making this way harder
than it needs to be.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.142
Okay? It's like--
like being on the pitcher's mound.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.394
Right? You don't mind folks
watching you then.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.563
Yeah, but then I'm in my zone.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.690
-You know, I know what to do.
-Then find your zone.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.151
Okay, look. You gotta believe
what you're saying.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.320
Okay?
And try to bring the audience with you.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.863
Yeah, but I don't even get this stuff.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.949
How am I supposed to bring the audience
with me

25:34.032 --> 25:35.992
when Jackson Lewis is sitting
in front of me?

25:36.451 --> 25:38.578
First, he was trash-talking Dad
and his baby mama

25:38.662 --> 25:39.788
and now Mom and Coach.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.582
I just don't understand why
they can't act like freaking adults.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.918
-Look...
-[Tyler sighs]

25:45.001 --> 25:46.753
...you can't control what other people do.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.547
All you control is how you react.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.049
And freak out
about Mom and Dad, I-- I get it.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.553
But you're really gonna let Jackson
"Skid Marks" Lewis intimidate you?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.388
[chuckles] Where'd you get that?

25:56.471 --> 25:58.306
[chuckles] I just made it up.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.559
Now think about that
during your presentation, okay?

26:00.976 --> 26:01.851
Let's hear it.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.562
[sighs] All right.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.815
[sighs] All right.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.944
What are you doing?
Don't look at me like that.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.029
[chuckles] Stop, you're  gonna
make me laugh. All right.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.365
Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter

26:15.448 --> 26:17.492
-examines sin, society, and freedom.
-[phone vibrating]

26:17.576 --> 26:20.245
It asks the reader
if maybe the people we shun

26:20.328 --> 26:22.163
might be stronger than the rest of us.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.822
Morning, my darling. Mwah.

26:56.239 --> 26:59.534
Mama, what are you doing here?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.745
[Paula] I am here to measure

27:02.120 --> 27:04.122
for that painting I'm doing for y'all.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.541
[stammers] Painting? What painting?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.501
My gift to y'all, for your opening.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.087
You know, give the place some panache.

27:11.504 --> 27:14.549
A commissioned Paula Vreeland original

27:14.633 --> 27:16.259
-on your walls.
-On our walls.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.302
Mm-hmm.

27:17.385 --> 27:20.764
You know, Mama, that is very sweet of you,
but that is not necessary.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.932
[stammers] No, gifts are never necessary.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.225
That's why they're gifts.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.644
-[exhales]
-I'll keep measuring in a minute,

27:25.727 --> 27:27.062
but right now,

27:28.104 --> 27:29.397
you have stories for me.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.567
About you...

27:33.568 --> 27:36.529
and that prime hunk of a baseball coach

27:36.613 --> 27:39.699
restaging The Rite of Spring
in your front yard.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.869
Mama, there is nothing going on
between me and Cal Maddox.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.245
Nothing.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.288
Oh.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.581
Well, that's a shame.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.668
-[exhales]
-He is gorgeous.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.127
He is kind...

27:51.753 --> 27:52.837
and he's not Bill.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.298
What more could you ask for?

27:56.299 --> 27:59.177
Well, baseball is Ty's safe haven.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.138
Look, things are hard enough
for all of us as it is

28:02.222 --> 28:03.765
without my taking up with the coach.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.602
Do you remember that self-portrait
I did when you were a teenager?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.897
Oh, the abstract nude
that hung in the public library

28:10.980 --> 28:11.981
for eight days?

28:12.065 --> 28:14.150
No, I can't say I recall that at all.

28:14.609 --> 28:15.652
[chuckles]

28:16.444 --> 28:18.154
I know it was hard for you, but...

28:18.697 --> 28:19.698
it was...

28:20.990 --> 28:23.785
it was something
that I needed to do for myself.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.745
You needed the whole county
to see your breasts.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.832
I needed to remind myself
that I was a woman.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.544
Remember I'd had my hysterectomy
a couple of months before?

28:32.961 --> 28:33.920
Mm-hmm.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.046
It changed me.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.800
Changed the way I felt about myself.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.553
Oh. You made it seem...

28:42.595 --> 28:45.223
so simple. I-- I-- I didn't realize that.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.933
The gossip died down.

28:47.016 --> 28:50.145
It always does, but the work...

28:51.146 --> 28:51.980
the...

28:53.231 --> 28:55.859
the feeling that the work gave me

28:55.942 --> 28:58.194
and all the women who saw it...

28:59.738 --> 29:00.989
that remained.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.116
Well, I'm glad.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.914
If you want to start something
with Cal Maddox, do it.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.584
You've been doing

29:13.084 --> 29:15.837
for other people for 20 years.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.174
It is beyond time you did something...

29:20.467 --> 29:21.468
or someone...

29:22.635 --> 29:23.636
for yourself.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.722
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.682
Now let's go.
Why don't we go to the yoga studio

29:27.766 --> 29:30.018
that I think will be perfect
for your commission piece?

29:37.525 --> 29:38.818
Pastor June?

29:38.902 --> 29:40.403
-Dana Sue.
-[laughs]

29:41.196 --> 29:42.405
[clears throat]

29:45.950 --> 29:47.202
Something on your mind?

29:47.702 --> 29:48.536
Well...

29:50.246 --> 29:52.916
I'm not too fond of myself these days.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.586
I've been wrangling some health problems,

29:56.669 --> 29:59.631
so everyone's hovering
and I know that they mean well,

29:59.714 --> 30:01.007
but it's driving me crazy.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.884
You're getting your health under control?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.427
[laughing]

30:04.511 --> 30:08.306
The only way I could see Howie more often
is if I took him home with me,

30:09.140 --> 30:11.434
and I am following his instructions

30:11.518 --> 30:14.354
to each and every aggravating letter.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.647
Doctors and preachers.

30:16.272 --> 30:19.484
Telling you to give up stuff
you already know isn't good for you.

30:21.110 --> 30:24.030
And that's the thing. I know what to do,
and I'm willing to do it...

30:25.490 --> 30:27.242
but for some reason, it, uh...

30:28.618 --> 30:32.038
it-- it makes me tense, or angry.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.125
I feel like I'm crazy.
All I'm doing is snapping at folks.

30:37.043 --> 30:41.256
You know, the loving,
caring, nagging folks closest to me.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.759
And the fact that they're only doing it
out of love clearly doesn't help.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.718
No.

30:46.803 --> 30:50.390
No. And I know I gave 'em a scare,
you know, but I...

30:50.473 --> 30:51.432
[sighs]

30:52.267 --> 30:54.060
...I scared myself, too.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.064
I watched my mother go through this,

30:59.023 --> 31:03.111
and I remember how helpless I felt
just watching her slip away.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.612
[sobbing]

31:05.780 --> 31:07.615
So you know how they feel.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.158
But, see, I'm not her,

31:10.326 --> 31:14.622
because I am in control of my life
and my health...

31:16.249 --> 31:17.333
and having them fret,

31:17.417 --> 31:20.628
it just makes me feel weak,
and I hate that.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.299
What makes you feel stronger?

31:25.842 --> 31:26.759
Um...

31:28.052 --> 31:31.097
[sniffs] Well, other than the company
of my wonderful pastor

31:31.180 --> 31:33.474
-and my steadfast faith in the Lord...
-[laughing]

31:34.601 --> 31:35.643
...uh...

31:36.895 --> 31:37.937
cooking...

31:38.730 --> 31:40.189
'cause I know I'm good.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.442
-Mm-hmm.
-[both laugh]

31:42.942 --> 31:45.737
And my food makes people happy.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.532
You know? It gives 'em a reason
to come together and...

31:50.533 --> 31:52.535
and my kitchen is my kingdom...

31:52.619 --> 31:53.453
Mm-hmm.

31:53.536 --> 31:57.874
...which is why passing out there
was so utterly mortifying.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.795
"Even the youth shall faint and be weary

32:03.713 --> 32:06.299
and the young men shall utterly fall,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.927
but they that wait on the Lord...

32:10.136 --> 32:11.804
shall renew their strength."

32:15.600 --> 32:17.852
So I should grow eagle's wings.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.812
-[laughs]
-No.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.442
If in the kitchen
is where you feel the strongest,

32:24.525 --> 32:27.278
reclaim that space, that strength,

32:28.112 --> 32:29.739
and do it out of joy,

32:30.365 --> 32:31.491
not anger.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.203
[chuckles]

32:36.120 --> 32:37.080
Thank you.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.539
[sighs]

32:46.214 --> 32:49.550
Aunt Frances, Ms. Paula, and Ms. Grace.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.635
Ah.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.887
I thought it was just gonna be
the two of us.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.931
Oh, we didn't mean to intrude,

32:55.014 --> 32:57.183
it's just that it's been so long
since we saw you,

32:57.266 --> 32:59.102
and we couldn't miss the opportunity

32:59.185 --> 33:00.895
to hear all about
what you've been doing with yourself.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.356
And why you're messing
with my daughter's business.

33:03.439 --> 33:07.026
All right, mama bear,
this is intended to be a friendly lunch.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.988
I hear you, Ms. Paula,
and I mean no disrespect.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.865
I admit I might have gotten
a little overheated

33:12.949 --> 33:14.951
when I heard what was going on
with Aunt Frances' house.

33:15.034 --> 33:18.037
A house that you haven't set foot in
since the Bush administration!

33:18.121 --> 33:19.706
That doesn't change
what the house means to me.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.834
I see it all the time in San Francisco.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.545
New businesses popping up
in old neighborhoods,

33:25.628 --> 33:27.088
destroying the history.

33:27.922 --> 33:31.217
Summers in Aunt Frances' house
were the best times of my life.

33:31.300 --> 33:35.096
I know the story of how the whole town
sprang up around that house.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.890
And I don't want it paved over.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.393
What makes you think the Magnolias
don't feel the same way?

33:40.893 --> 33:43.187
[Paula] Those three are creating jobs.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.314
They are creating a destination

33:45.398 --> 33:49.944
that's gonna bring customers
from Castlewood, Egret Falls,

33:50.611 --> 33:51.654
even Charleston.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.490
You'll always have your memories
of the house.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.867
We all will.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.703
So, what are you hanging on to?

34:00.705 --> 34:02.165
[Dana Sue] Afternoon.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.835
An amuse-bouche with my compliments.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.462
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

34:07.545 --> 34:10.548
It is just so wonderful
to see you all here today.

34:14.052 --> 34:14.927
Enjoy.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.180
-[Paula] Thank you, darlin'
-Thank you.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.641
Afternoon, Mr. Van.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.437
I should engrave your name on this table,
you're here so often.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.272
-You giving me the brush-off?
-Never.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.274
-Hmm. Good.
-[laughs]

34:28.357 --> 34:30.568
Sullivan's is the closest I've come
to a home-cooked meal

34:30.651 --> 34:31.527
since my wife passed.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.490
[chuckles] For a man that can't cook,
y'all are a godsend.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.118
Well, that's the sweetest thing
I've heard all week.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.287
I'll be sure to share that with Erik.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.873
The only thing saving me from TV dinners

34:43.956 --> 34:46.667
is you and the fish fries at the VFW.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.253
Well, it's good you're gettin' out.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.839
Well, the VFW is more about company
than food.

34:51.923 --> 34:52.757
Oh.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.635
Makes me feel good spending time
with the fellows, helping out,

34:56.052 --> 34:59.806
but, Lord, I didn't know
catfish could taste that bad!

35:00.431 --> 35:03.142
Oh, now, see, bad catfish is a crime.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.811
What spices are you using?

35:05.311 --> 35:06.395
Spices?

35:06.479 --> 35:07.814
Mr. Van...

35:08.856 --> 35:11.526
All right, now you are not leaving here
without a bushel of spices

35:11.609 --> 35:13.236
and some good oil.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.821
You know what, you sit tight.

35:21.828 --> 35:22.703

They won. Hey, they won!
Noreen! They did it!

35:26.040 --> 35:26.916
Ha ha!

35:26.999 --> 35:30.128
-That's amazing!
-The Bulldogs are goin' to regionals.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.796
How 'bout that, huh?

35:31.879 --> 35:34.298
Well, aren't you just
prouder than a peacock!

35:34.382 --> 35:36.050
The whole team's gonna be at Wharton's.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.927
Why don't you go
and just say congratulations?

35:38.010 --> 35:41.264
No, heck no. We are going to Wharton's.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.933
-Me and you. Come on, let's go.
-Okay.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.143
[Bill laughs]

35:46.269 --> 35:47.186
Later.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.034
Hey.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.787
Are these seats taken?

36:05.496 --> 36:08.332
Not yet, but I do have to warn you,

36:08.416 --> 36:10.126
I have been told that people might talk.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.170
Let 'em.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.213
Talk about what?

36:14.297 --> 36:16.299
Katydid! Come with Nana.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.718
I need someone to eat my pepperoni for me.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.678
[laughing]

36:21.262 --> 36:22.555
They just delivered it.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.641
And I remember this dude
from earlier in the season, right?

36:25.725 --> 36:27.560
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Number 15.
-Yeah, exactly.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.812
And I'm, like, signaling like crazy,

36:29.896 --> 36:32.190
and this guy right here,
Mr. Laser Focus over here...

36:32.273 --> 36:34.400
You were going so fast, I couldn't even
tell what side you were throwing on.

36:34.483 --> 36:35.860
No, he just throws a freaking--

36:35.943 --> 36:38.446
Hey, good job, team! Good game!

36:38.529 --> 36:40.072
Good game, Tyler!

36:40.156 --> 36:42.200
-Hey.
-Oh, I'm proud of you, son.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.743
You were great tonight, honey.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.244
-I appreciate that.
-Hashtag Team Ty.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.162
Yeah.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.914
Well, uh, thanks for stopping by.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.334
Ah, come here, boy.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.295
[Bill] Oh, I'm proud of you.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.756
[Tyler] All right.
I gotta get back to the team.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.053
-Okay.
-Yeah. I'll see you guys.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.015
[Katie] Daddy?

37:17.151 --> 37:18.903
[Bill] Howie told me something
might be going on,

37:18.986 --> 37:21.072
but I thought that woman had more sense.

37:21.447 --> 37:24.659
I mean, has she given any thought
to what this is gonna do to Tyler?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.702
Here she is, out in the open.

37:26.786 --> 37:30.122
Just out in public, flirting it up
with the high school baseball coach,

37:30.206 --> 37:31.916
like everything is just fine.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.292
Perfectly fine.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.419
I mean, she grew up in this town.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.381
She knows how people talk
and gossip and carry on.

37:44.220 --> 37:48.057
Though the novel was published in 1850,

37:51.602 --> 37:52.770
Hawthorne's use of...

37:53.396 --> 37:54.522
Puritan culture...

37:55.064 --> 37:57.275
uh, his use of Puritan culture was--

37:57.358 --> 37:58.734
Focus, Mr. Townsend.

37:59.151 --> 37:59.986
Sorry.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.195
[sniffs]

38:01.821 --> 38:05.032
Hawthorne's use of Puritan culture
was deliberate.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.913
Puritans prized conformity.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.084
They couldn't question the rules
and any infraction was punished severely.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.796
In comparison to Hester Prynne,

38:18.879 --> 38:21.841
the townspeople shunning her
come across as...

38:22.633 --> 38:25.136
cowardly and... pretty darn pathetic.

38:29.181 --> 38:31.309
[whistling]

38:31.392 --> 38:32.393

Well, I'm Dana Sue Sullivan.
I'm here to see Van Crockett.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.112
You was the one
who had Van coming back here

38:43.195 --> 38:44.613
messing with how we do things?

38:45.948 --> 38:46.782
Yes, sir.

38:47.825 --> 38:48.784
Well...

38:49.410 --> 38:50.286
God bless you.

38:50.828 --> 38:51.996
-Oh.
-[laughs]

38:52.079 --> 38:53.497
-Let me help you with this.
-Okay.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.708
-I got 'em all. yeah, I got 'em all.
-You got 'em?

38:58.002 --> 39:00.463
-Hey, I'm Vernon.
-Hello.

39:00.546 --> 39:01.714

I know Dana Sue, you fool.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.052
You just gonna stand there,
let him intimidate me like that?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.428
-Yeah, sure.
-Yes, see how he did?

39:07.511 --> 39:09.889
Didn't trust me to do things myself, huh?

39:10.556 --> 39:12.641
Trust has nothing to do with it.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.643
I just wanted to help is all.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.270
That's why you brought
your own provisions?

39:16.354 --> 39:18.898
Well, I thought I would show you
how to bake the fish.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.691
It'll be crispier and better for you.

39:20.775 --> 39:25.488
Plus, I brought some... healthier sides.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.990
-Healthy.
-Okay, then.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.909
Why don't you show us what you can do?

that magical house of yours.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.259
that house was filled with people.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.303
Parties, meetings, visits.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.638
Near the end, I told Daddy

42:37.721 --> 42:39.807
it didn't make sense for me
to keep such a big house

42:39.890 --> 42:41.475
when it was gonna be just me,

42:41.559 --> 42:44.812
and he said,
"Why would it ever be just you?"

42:44.895 --> 42:46.021
[both laugh]

42:46.522 --> 42:48.274
So when all my family was gone,

42:48.357 --> 42:51.235
I kept filling it with people
who needed laughter

42:51.777 --> 42:52.987
or shelter

42:53.696 --> 42:54.530
or quiet,

42:55.823 --> 42:58.701
but most of all,
I kept filling it with friends.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.080
We bloomed there.

43:03.706 --> 43:04.790
They will, too.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.036

so I know that he loves me,

that your daddy loves you.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.320
Well, I mean, I don't have
an ex-baseball star chasing me around,

44:58.404 --> 45:00.322
but I did just get myself

45:00.823 --> 45:01.824
three new boyfriends.

45:01.907 --> 45:03.701
[laughs] Wait, what?

45:03.784 --> 45:06.537
Well, I'll explain when Helen gets here,
if she ever does.

45:17.756 --> 45:19.049
I've been in court all day.

45:19.133 --> 45:22.261
If you're here to play more games,
I have happier places to be.

45:22.344 --> 45:23.345
Come inside.

45:24.930 --> 45:25.764
Please.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.783
This used to be the living room.

45:47.494 --> 45:48.620
I mean,

45:48.704 --> 45:50.831
like, when the house was first built,
it was the school.

45:50.914 --> 45:53.876
I can recite this house's history
backwards and forwards

45:53.959 --> 45:55.461
just as well as you can.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.005
When I was growing up, the...

45:59.798 --> 46:00.924
the couch was here.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.510
Green and gold floral...

46:05.471 --> 46:08.974
and that is where you were sitting
when I saw you for the first time.

46:12.019 --> 46:15.355
Your mother left you with Aunt Frances
while she ran some errands.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.776
It was the summer
after your father passed,

46:18.859 --> 46:20.986
and she still didn't want
to leave you alone.

46:22.070 --> 46:22.946
So...

46:23.947 --> 46:27.451
you were curled up
right in the corner of the couch

46:27.534 --> 46:29.578
with a book, of course...

46:31.330 --> 46:34.458
and I was 14
and I wanted to fix the world for you.

46:38.504 --> 46:43.300
Um, earlier... tonight, I started to write
my righteous statement

46:43.383 --> 46:44.384
for the City Council...

46:45.928 --> 46:48.472
on how the Wingates used to run
a soup kitchen

46:48.555 --> 46:50.557
out of here during the Great Depression,

46:50.933 --> 46:51.850
fed the town.

46:52.434 --> 46:56.146
But all I could...
All I could think about was you.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.357
[chuckles] You were standing right there

46:58.440 --> 47:00.526
introducing me
to homemade lemonade popsicles.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.657
That was, uh... That was my room...

47:07.825 --> 47:09.034
during the summers...

47:10.661 --> 47:11.829
where you'd sit and...

47:13.455 --> 47:15.249
talk me through all my family drama.

47:18.627 --> 47:21.129
This was the tree
where we had our first kiss.

47:23.799 --> 47:28.470
Don't you dare imply
that this house, its history,

47:28.554 --> 47:30.097
our history

47:30.180 --> 47:32.057
means less to me than it does to you!

47:33.433 --> 47:34.601
I loved you!

47:38.146 --> 47:40.023
Do you think I forgot about that?

47:41.942 --> 47:43.527
I needed to know that you hadn't.

47:44.695 --> 47:45.988
Ryan, please.

47:47.281 --> 47:48.991
Please. What do you want?

47:49.074 --> 47:50.075
You.

47:52.411 --> 47:53.745
Only you.
