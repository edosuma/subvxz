01:35.395 --> 01:39.661
This is of course sensational!

01:45.972 --> 01:49.600
Panthro was really on
something this time, right?

01:49.709 --> 01:53.543
Yes. Now we can really move.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.777
Beware!

02:01.287 --> 02:04.300
I do not know,
it might be something wrong with this.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.584
The swing in one direction.

02:06.759 --> 02:10.888
It is because you can not go.
Check it here.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.732
Yes!

02:15.034 --> 02:20.336
Seriously! Panthro may fix this.

02:22.609 --> 02:26.443
So yes.
Now, you just talk into it.

02:26.613 --> 02:32.200
-How? No buttons?
-Yes. It is voice activated.

02:32.352 --> 02:37.800
-You can reach the monitoring center immediately.
The others-from Thundercats, then?

02:37.924 --> 02:42.999
Everyone will have them.
We connect us. Total communication.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.805
You seem troubled, my son.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.607
How was Thun Dera, Chase?
I mean, what happened there?

03:01.414 --> 03:05.600
-You feel homesick.
"I wish I knew more.

03:05.785 --> 03:11.400
No wonder. You were only 12
when you left Thun Dera.

03:11.591 --> 03:16.324
And when you landed on the third world,
were you a man.

03:16.496 --> 03:21.700
-You missed the whole childhood.
-Tell me about Thun Dera.

03:21.801 --> 03:25.862
I can do better than that,
I can show you.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.998
-How?
"When we abandoned Thun Dera ...

03:30.176 --> 03:33.888
... did we not empty-handed.

03:34.948 --> 03:42.777
<i> We had with us a tidkapsel.
An atomic-Optocrystal.</i>

03:59.939 --> 04:04.899
<i> It contained the story of our planet.</i>

04:05.078 --> 04:08.241
<i> Until it was destroyed ...</i>

04:16.189 --> 04:19.680
<i> Find tidkapseln, Lion-O ...</i>

04:19.858 --> 04:23.999
<i> ... you will find
to much about your childhood.</i>

04:26.799 --> 04:32.431
Yes, Lion-O, everything about
Thun, neither in tidkapaseln.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.598
But we thought that the
destroyed in the crash.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.370
How do we find it?

04:39.545 --> 04:44.039
We may look systematically.
We were his direction.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.983
And we will check with Panthros new
Municipality unique tion apparatus.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.987
Can we use the hovercraft?

04:51.157 --> 04:55.059
No, you should be home.
You're too young.

04:55.228 --> 04:59.665
Come on, Snarf.
We can take care of ourselves.

04:59.832 --> 05:05.500
Snarf is right. Someone must be home.
And you are safer here.

05:05.738 --> 05:09.666
"It is sad.
-Yes, that's it.

05:34.100 --> 05:39.600
"Come on, Kat, we set off.
-Are you sure it's a good idea?

05:39.772 --> 05:45.500
-What is it? Are you afraid?
-Of course not.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.011
Come on.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.853
Can we pause, Lion-O?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.999
We rest when we get
to the river by despair.

06:12.004 --> 06:15.132
How do we overcome that?

06:15.308 --> 06:20.800
-You can swim well, or?
"We should have stayed together.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.107
We could have used Thunderbird idea.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.015
What?

06:32.692 --> 06:39.800
-What is that?
"It's the black shark.

06:39.932 --> 06:47.999
She is waiting for anyone who ...
trying to cross the river by despair.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.888
Must dig.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.291
Dig, dig ...

07:11.831 --> 07:16.495
Excuse me,
has anyone of you seen a tidkapsel?

07:16.669 --> 07:22.500
-It looks like a box.
-Dig, dig. Deeper, deeper.

07:22.675 --> 07:28.300
-I am looking for a tidkapsel.
-Dig, dig, dig ...

07:28.848 --> 07:31.476
Communication is not presented.

07:38.825 --> 07:43.387
Where's my gold?

07:44.730 --> 07:47.392
Gold!

07:47.567 --> 07:52.129
Give me the gold, molema!

07:55.842 --> 08:04.400
You can not hide for Molemaster!
Give me gold!

08:07.019 --> 08:11.251
An intruder in molema mine!

08:12.358 --> 08:15.156
You will have to pay for this.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.333
Behind you.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.888
Not as brave as you thought,
Molemaster.

08:46.359 --> 08:53.100
Can you help me now?
I am looking for a tidkapsel.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.791
Must dig, dig.
Must dig.

08:57.069 --> 09:00.937
Expect no service in return.

09:05.678 --> 09:09.705
Soon you will see the light bro ...

09:09.882 --> 09:14.888
... which takes you over
the river of despair.

09:24.664 --> 09:28.225
The bridge is finished.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.596
It is beautiful.

09:31.771 --> 09:36.555
Hurry,
power is not long.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.191
Save us, Chase!

10:06.005 --> 10:10.100
Move over, Snarf!
It will attack again!

10:24.890 --> 10:28.999
The sword! Beam bridge makes
that it does not work!

10:38.337 --> 10:40.555
The bridge collapse!

11:04.597 --> 11:06.997
Lion-O!

11:07.166 --> 11:11.333
Back, Snarf.
It is about to collapse!

11:29.755 --> 11:35.700
-That I would never do.
-One thing only ...

11:35.828 --> 11:39.999
-What?
-How do we get back?

11:42.401 --> 11:46.700
Calling Cheetara. Cheetara.
Can you hear me?

11:47.306 --> 11:52.500
<i>-Found nothing </ i>
-No, tygr. Just a few flowers.</i>

11:52.678 --> 11:57.377
<i> I call Panthro, and check
what happens to him. Good luck.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:11.888
Okay, let's see how it
go to you with a little speed.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.627
<i>-Come in, Panthro. </ i>
"I hear you, tygr.</i>

12:44.730 --> 12:48.994
<i>-Have you found anything? </ i>
-Just a few small crabs.</i>

12:56.742 --> 13:00.999
-What do you think is there?
"We may find out.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.333
Beware!

13:26.372 --> 13:28.932
Take hold of my hand, Wilykit!

14:09.949 --> 14:14.477
I do not understand why Chase is not
said was tidkapseln is somewhere.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.882
"It would have saved a lot of problems.
"He has his reasons.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.777
Tell us about Thun Dera, Snarf.
How was it?

14:29.034 --> 14:33.222
What? Talk more, Snarf.
You mumble.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.343
Come on now ... What?

15:13.212 --> 15:15.736
Let him go!

16:10.602 --> 16:15.500
Snarf. Down there, at the cave.
Do you think it may be that we are looking for?

16:16.342 --> 16:18.400
I'm not sure.

16:18.777 --> 16:22.999
Omens sword
give me sight beyond sight!

16:26.051 --> 16:30.100
There is somebody silver box.
I think we've found it!

16:30.289 --> 16:33.333
Time to call us Thundercats!

16:36.128 --> 16:41.999
Thunder, thunder, thunder.
Thundercats, ho!

17:13.832 --> 17:18.444
It may not have landed here.
It is too far from the scene.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.997
But who has hit it then?

17:32.151 --> 17:37.555
"He lets us probably do not take it.
How-to he stop us?

17:43.028 --> 17:46.486
I'm sorry,
caveman, but it is ours.

17:46.665 --> 17:49.666
We need it, and will take it.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.555
He wants you to break the arm.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.444
Do you give me the capsule if I win?

18:08.320 --> 18:15.100
You will never win this;
Lion-O. Look what great he is.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.558
We'll see.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.821
Lion-O Thundercats.

18:48.227 --> 18:56.444
No, Snarf, I fight myself. I
accepted his challenge, not them.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.240
Leave him alone. Let him do it himself.
It is man against man.

19:23.962 --> 19:27.999
You did it, Lion-O!
That thought I never!

19:33.605 --> 19:37.097
We have it! But it does not look
much to the world, right?

19:37.276 --> 19:40.006
Wait until you see Optocrystal.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.309
A perfect model of Thun Dera,
your home.

19:44.483 --> 19:48.900
-Can we not look at it now?
-No, it can be damaged.

19:49.154 --> 19:53.147
We take it home and open it there.

19:53.458 --> 19:59.777
I've waited this long ...
A day to play no role.

20:07.906 --> 20:12.400
-What are you two doing here?
-You would surely be at home.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.344
And I said:
"Never Go two blocks on the same board."

20:16.582 --> 20:22.500
"We did not want to miss anything.
And the second sill stroked.

20:22.788 --> 20:27.782
Stroked? Do you know how long
time it took to make them?

20:27.960 --> 20:31.555
I'm sorry, Panthro.
We're not thinking.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.962
Good thing you did not encounter
on anything dangerous on the way here.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.727
Well ... lucky for us.

20:39.905 --> 20:45.900
"It was a breeze.
-Did you lie now?

20:46.078 --> 20:50.447
You mean ...?
If we tell the truth?

20:50.916 --> 20:54.647
Okay, it was almost a breeze.

20:55.120 --> 21:00.900
We pointed out almost.
It is well truth.

21:01.159 --> 21:07.300
-Good that you tell it.
"I can well organize a board to.

21:07.466 --> 21:11.732
And a one-week curfew
should not be so hard to take.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.999
-Curfew?
-You may only be at home.

21:18.810 --> 21:22.800
Is it okay if I
go back to your board?
