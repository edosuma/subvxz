WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:11.077
We'll be right back
with Julia Wilcox

00:11.077 --> 00:14.080
and our new stock market update
after this.

00:15.615 --> 00:16.616
That's it?

00:16.616 --> 00:18.618
That's your big introducti
on for Julia?

00:18.618 --> 00:20.587
What happened to the copy
I wrote for you?

00:20.920 --> 00:24.991
Come on, "Julia" does not rhyme with "moolah."

00:24.991 --> 00:25.992
Well, they're spelled
the same.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.395
Oh, they are not. Stop it.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.830
Isn't it enough that she's getting ten
minutes of my show?

00:30.830 --> 00:32.631
Hey, hey,
we're lucky to have her.

00:32.966 --> 00:33.967
Don't be surprised
if she ends up

00:33.967 --> 00:35.535
boosting your
ratings a notch.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.037
Yes, but at what cost?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.838
The woman's credibility
is questionable.

00:39.105 --> 00:39.639
She's credible
.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.674
The woman was on CNBC.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.176
She had a
syndicated column.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.145
You can't hold one
mistake against her.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.980
What'd she do?

00:46.980 --> 00:51.151
She wrote a book called
Day Trade Your Way Out of Debt.

00:52.952 --> 00:56.423
Apparently, some people
lost money.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.825
I don't see you
writing any books.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.827
Now, listen,
she's a little sensitive
.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.329
So, I don't want hear anyone talking about the book

01:03.329 --> 01:04.664
how it ruined her career

01:04.998 --> 01:07.067
that guy who killed
himself in Pennsylva...

01:07.067 --> 01:08.368
Hey, hey, hey!

01:08.635 --> 01:09.702
There she is!

01:10.136 --> 01:11.171
Our financial wizard.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.173
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
Hello.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.175
And his producer
Roz Doyle.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.710
So, this is my mike?

01:18.211 --> 01:19.045
Yes, yes.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.347
You know, I studied
finance in college.

01:21.848 --> 01:22.849
Hey, that's great.

01:22.849 --> 01:26.286
Do you think you could
get me some coffee, Rizzo?

01:28.154 --> 01:29.189
It's Roz.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.123
Super.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.826
Two creams. Thanks.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.663
So, um, do your intro,
we'll go to a promo

01:36.663 --> 01:38.164
then back to you.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.667
Got it?
Intro, promo, you.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.436
So you don't want me
to do the intro last?

01:43.670 --> 01:44.737
Uh, no, because

01:44.737 --> 01:46.739
you see, intro's short...

01:46.739 --> 01:48.141
(chuckles):
Oh, I get it.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.476
Very good.

01:49.843 --> 01:50.910
You got one past me.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.880
Enjoy it, it's not
going to happen again.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.416
And these would be
my phones.

01:56.916 --> 01:57.917
Yes, yes, of course.

01:57.917 --> 02:01.421
I must say that
I enjoyed your
work on CNBC.

02:01.421 --> 02:04.924
I thought you were
an insightful analyst.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.927
And I don't believe that you were treated fairly.

02:08.360 --> 02:08.928
Oh, thanks.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.231
That makes everything
all better.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.832
Ten seconds.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.901
Oh, thanks.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.670
(coughs):
You call this coffee?

02:17.670 --> 02:20.006
Most of it.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.941
(chuckles)

02:21.941 --> 02:22.909
Roz.

02:24.944 --> 02:27.447
Put that over there.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.415
Hello, Seattle
Welcome back.

02:29.415 --> 02:32.385
If you've tuned in
for mental health advice

02:32.385 --> 02:33.887
with an erudite twist,

02:38.391 --> 02:40.460
But now for something new,

02:40.960 --> 02:42.428
as finances can be the cause

02:42.428 --> 02:45.665
.
of that old bugaboo-- stress. Here now..

02:45.665 --> 02:47.167
Good afternoon,
I'm Julia Wilcox.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.135
Today's market swerved

02:49.569 --> 02:50.637
like a nervous student driver

02:50.637 --> 02:54.574
before finally winding up
in a nice, safe neutral.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.410
Are pharmaceutical stocks
still worth prescribing?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.912
Now this.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.346
Excuse me.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.148
I was supposed to introduce you.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.516
You were cutting into my time.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.417
Well, I was giving you

03:04.417 --> 03:05.785
a hospitable segue.

03:05.785 --> 03:07.287
You see, I thought that
since you're new here

03:07.787 --> 03:10.623
I could lend you my
equity, if you will.

03:10.623 --> 03:11.624
It was just
a courtesy.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.426
Some days on the market

03:13.626 --> 03:15.195
it's black Friday,
but today

03:15.195 --> 03:17.063
with the Nasdaq
slightly down

03:17.063 --> 03:19.299
and the Dow slightly up,
it was more like

03:19.299 --> 03:20.633
plaid Monday.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.636
Analysts spoke out
of both sides...

03:23.636 --> 03:26.539
Next time I'll get the coffee.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.381
Julia's book.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.251
Listen to this
 "Chapter Four

03:38.251 --> 03:41.588
How to Sell Your House
and Start a Dot-Com."

03:43.423 --> 03:44.924
Hey, guys.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.493
Oh, Roz, I can't believe
you shelled out three dollars

03:47.493 --> 03:49.495
to revel in someone
else's misfortune.

03:49.495 --> 03:50.930
I was curious.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.466
Well, you can get the same thing on tape for $1.50.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.467
Get this

03:54.901 --> 03:56.469
it's read by Martha Stewart.

03:56.469 --> 03:57.937
How's that
for your double whammy?

03:57.937 --> 04:00.406
(laughing)

04:00.907 --> 04:02.809
We should just get rid of her.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.711
I mean,
if she were nice

04:05.078 --> 04:05.612
it'd be one thing.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.480
But she's just rude
and arrogant.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.782
Whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody's getting rid of anybody.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.353
She just filed suit against CNBC
for wrongful termination.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.822
Legal wants us to treat her
with kid gloves.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.257
Truth be told...

04:17.257 --> 04:19.625
I actually feel sorry for her.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.629
She has suffered
a very public fall.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.631
She must be carrying
all kinds of guilt

04:24.631 --> 04:27.400
about the people who lost their
savings following her advice.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.338
You know, perhaps I shou
ld have a talk with her.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.341
I wondered how long
it would take.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.342
What?

04:36.843 --> 04:39.178
For you to make your move.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.314
I thought there were
some sparks between you two.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.649
What are you
talking about?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.651
Don't play innocent.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.153
She is right up your alley.

04:47.153 --> 04:52.091
Smart, tough...
total bitch.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.727
You can't wait

04:54.727 --> 04:56.729
to break through
that wall and rescue her.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.232
Oh, Roz, you couldn't
be more off the mark.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.700
Typical man.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.670
You always want to get in there
and rescue us.

05:03.670 --> 05:07.507
But the minute things get messy,
you just can'’’t handle it

05:07.507 --> 05:08.808
Ha!

05:08.808 --> 05:11.311
Women want to make us
think that they're tough.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.813
And then all of a sudden,
they get needy.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.317
Men are like, "Come on, baby,
you can lean on me.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.118
Oops, got to go."

05:19.319 --> 05:22.188
."
Yeah, women are like, "Get away,
get away. Don't leave me

05:22.188 --> 05:24.524
Here's men:
(deep groan)

05:24.524 --> 05:27.327
Here's women:
(helpless squeal)

05:27.527 --> 05:28.594
(deep groaning)
(squeals)

05:28.594 --> 05:30.596
All right, stop it, both of you!

05:33.599 --> 05:34.567
Hello, all.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.002
Hello, Niles.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.370
How's it going?

05:37.370 --> 05:39.205
We're just
discussing a new

05:39.505 --> 05:41.074
rather unpleasant colleague of ours.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.575
Be thankful that
you're self-employed.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.577
You don't have to
deal with these headaches.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.546
Oh, not so.
I was hoping to come here

05:46.546 --> 05:47.980
and complain
about my office remodel.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.850
I'm annexing
the dermatologist's
office next door.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.799
And in a cheap irony,
my skin is breaking out.

05:54.799 --> 05:56.856
Oh, your spackle allergy again?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.691
I'm covered with tiny bumps.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.693
It's worse than the summer

06:00.693 --> 06:03.463
we added the breakfast nook
to the tree house.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.231
Could I have my usual?

06:05.231 --> 06:06.232
Thank you.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.567
ROZ:
There she is.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.403
Don't come over,
don't come over,
don't come over.

06:12.538 --> 06:18.611
Oh, look who's
too good for us.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.113
You know what?

06:20.113 --> 06:24.617
I think I will
go and offer her
an olive branch.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.119
(low groan)
Oh, stop it.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.587
(helpless squeal)
Knock it off.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.460
Hello, Julia.

06:34.761 --> 06:35.762
Hello.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.730
Listen, I, uh...

06:37.730 --> 06:40.233
I'm sorry that
the two of us got off

06:40.233 --> 06:41.734
to a bit of a frosty start.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.236
But I think that in time

06:43.236 --> 06:45.605
we will have a very long
and rewarding relationship.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.975
Okay.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.245
May I tell you a story?

06:52.445 --> 06:54.814
(sighs)

06:55.081 --> 06:56.649
Years ago, I lived in Boston.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.653
I was in private practice then
and life was very good.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.655
And then my wife left me.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.125
I ended up on a ledge,
threatening to throw myself off

07:06.659 --> 07:07.560
if she didn't return to me

07:07.894 --> 07:09.462
Thank you.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.864
Well...

07:11.864 --> 07:14.300
this got on the news,
of course.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.302
And needless to say,
after that

07:16.302 --> 07:21.240
patients were a little
hard to come by.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.210
So...

07:24.210 --> 07:26.879
just wanted you to know
that I, too, have suffered

07:26.879 --> 07:29.282
a very public setback.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.150
Oh, I get it.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.653
You're letting me know
I'm not alone.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.154
Exactly.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.089
And now we
can be friends.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.492
.
Well, if that's how you feel

07:39.492 --> 07:41.461
Let's see, how do I feel?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.963
Well, it's sort of like
on your show

07:43.963 --> 07:46.432
when you call people at home
to give them advice...

07:46.833 --> 07:48.301
Actually, I don't call them, they call me.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.604
Exactly.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.480
Well.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.181
Good day, then.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.487
Why would you let Niles

08:07.987 --> 08:09.055
bring all his patients
to your home?

08:09.555 --> 08:10.556
It's only
a couple more weeks

08:10.556 --> 08:12.058
until his office
is finished.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.527
Well, I sure wouldn't want
to have all those crazies over.

08:15.027 --> 08:18.564
I mean, what if one of them
starts screaming obscenities

08:18.564 --> 08:20.900
or running through
the house naked?

08:21.167 --> 08:24.737
Mum already did that when
England lost in the World Cup.

08:26.706 --> 08:27.707
Hey.
Hello, all.
Hello.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.108
How was the Wine Expo?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.877
Horrible!

08:31.210 --> 08:33.212
Frasier ran into a fan.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.714
Ow, that smarts.

08:34.714 --> 08:35.982
Yes, Dad.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.717
You have been using
that same old joke

08:37.717 --> 08:40.219
for the last ten years.

08:40.219 --> 08:43.556
So anyway, I ran into
this fan...

08:43.556 --> 08:45.791
Ouch. Are you okay?

08:49.028 --> 08:52.598
So, this woman
complimented me

08:52.598 --> 08:53.933
on my so-called

08:53.933 --> 08:57.737
chemistry with that harpy Julia.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.505
Have you ever heard anything

08:59.705 --> 09:00.773
more preposterous?

09:01.274 --> 09:05.278
Good lord, the woman sneezed
once and I said, "Bless you."

09:05.278 --> 09:08.180
That has been the extent
of our byplay.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.583
You've been complaining
about her so much lately

09:11.050 --> 09:12.084
I'm beginning to wonder

09:12.084 --> 09:13.920
if there's not
something deeper there.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.223
I will not even dignify that
with a response.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.725
Except to say that you
couldn't be more wrong.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.429
.
I don't know, Frasier.
She's certainly attractive

09:23.429 --> 09:26.365
And she's intelligent,
ambitious, tenacious...

09:26.732 --> 09:28.067
Sounds like your
perfect woman.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.203
She is a cold,
insufferable know-it-all.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.439
And the list goes on and on.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.275
All right, that's it.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.277
No more talking
about Julia.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.612
Oh

09:39.612 --> 09:43.282
so it's "Julia" now.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.618
(teasingly):
Oh...

09:45.618 --> 09:48.621
It has always been Julia.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.022
That is her name.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.425
She does seem to have you
disproportionately upset.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.427
You haven't been
so consumed with one subject

09:54.427 --> 09:57.229
since Frasier Crane Day.

09:57.463 --> 10:01.033
Listen, my outrage
is completely merited.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.035
That woman is
deliberately trying

10:03.035 --> 10:05.037
to undermine my show
from within.

10:05.037 --> 10:06.539
I am sorry to disappoint
all of you

10:06.539 --> 10:09.041
but I have absolutely
no feelings for that woman

10:09.041 --> 10:10.309
except contempt.

10:10.643 --> 10:11.644
There he goes again.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.613
You know what they say about
people who protest too much?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.981
I know what you used to say--

10:14.981 --> 10:17.316
"They should
all be teargassed."

10:19.318 --> 10:20.753
I still think that, you know.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.158
Ah, here you are.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.660
Listen...

10:27.660 --> 10:30.196
It's time the two of us
had it out.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.697
Ever since you arrived here

10:31.697 --> 10:34.200
you have been nothing but
condescending and dismissive.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.201
Whatever.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.203
There, you did it again.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.704
You know what this
is really about?

10:39.138 --> 10:41.707
It's about you losing 15 minutes from your precious show.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.377
What are you talking about?
It's ten minutes.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.213
Sorry. Starting Monday, I do
the last 15 minutes of your show

10:47.713 --> 10:49.181
with a half-hour recap
on Fridays.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.984
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have places to be.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.086
No, I will not
excuse you.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.421
I am reaching out to you here.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.889
Yeah, will you cut that out?

10:56.889 --> 10:59.392
It's like you're trying
to make me your special project.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.227
Why don't you just adopt a cat or something?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.063
As your colleague

11:04.063 --> 11:06.966
I do not deserve
to be treated this way.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.402
Oh, no, we are
hardly colleagues.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.737
I deliver the news and you're a..

11:11.737 --> 11:14.874
Magic Eight Ball
with a Harvard degree.

11:15.174 --> 11:15.708
(gasps deeply)

11:16.208 --> 11:18.744
I will not be belittled
by a half-educated

11:18.744 --> 11:21.247
money-grubbing parvenu!

11:21.247 --> 11:23.749
As opposed to some
foreign-speaking windbag!

11:24.250 --> 11:25.751
That makes you
an insecure fraud!

11:25.751 --> 11:27.153
You are a pompous
blowhard!

11:27.520 --> 11:28.654
Harridan!
Know-it-all!

11:28.654 --> 11:29.989
Shrew!
Snob!

11:30.189 --> 11:31.657
Are you as turned on
as I am?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.393
What? No!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.028
Did you just
come on to me?!

11:36.228 --> 11:38.130
What? No... No, I thought...
I thought that...

11:38.364 --> 11:39.932
How could you think
I was turned on?

11:39.932 --> 11:41.400
What, are you sick?!

11:41.901 --> 11:44.437
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's all calm down here

11:44.437 --> 11:45.404
Are you crazy?

11:45.404 --> 11:46.405
No, I apologize!
I... I...

11:46.872 --> 11:48.407
(disgusted groan)

11:56.515 --> 11:58.017
Oh, hey, Dr. Crane.
How...

12:02.588 --> 12:04.090
They hate me, don't they

12:04.090 --> 12:05.057
Can you blame them?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.992
Because of you,
they had to come in here

12:06.992 --> 12:07.993
for this sexual harassment
seminar.

12:07.993 --> 12:08.828
(sighing):
I know.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.196
But I have apologized

12:10.196 --> 12:11.964
till I'm blue in the face.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.199
I know, but Legal wants us covered

12:13.733 --> 12:15.234
in case Julia tries to come after us.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.235
Maybe you've heard:

12:16.235 --> 12:19.739
She loves suing
people's asses off.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.607
I'm going to miss saying "asses."

12:24.043 --> 12:27.513
After today, I guess
it's back to "patootie."

12:27.847 --> 12:29.415
Thanks a lot, Doc.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.555
Hi. Welcome.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.491
Please take a workbook

12:44.697 --> 12:45.731
Hey, Frasier.
Mmm.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.767
Thanks for ruining my weekend.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.235
Oh, Roz...

12:49.235 --> 12:51.270
Come on, you know
it was just a mistake.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.772
What do you think I am,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.273
some sort of
disgusting Lothario?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.275
Hey! There's my man!

12:57.743 --> 12:58.778
Welcome. Please
take a workbook.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.746
Got an old one.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.782
Hey, I know you're down.
Don't sweat it.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.183
Rookie mistake.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.119
By the way, the chick
at the coffee table's
got her high beams on.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.120
(barks)

13:10.000 --> 13:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:17.897 --> 13:19.465
(clears throat)

13:22.468 --> 13:25.271
KENNY:
Okay, people, let's get this started.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.605
Uh, first of all, I apologize

13:26.605 --> 13:28.107
for bringing everyone in here today,

13:28.107 --> 13:29.608
but to make it up to you,

13:29.608 --> 13:31.544
everyone attending today will get a free mousepad.

13:31.944 --> 13:32.511
How's that?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.313
ROZ:
It sucks.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.081
All right,
who said that?

13:36.415 --> 13:37.917
I did.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.119
Fair enough.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.822
Now, I don't want
to blame anyone...

13:42.822 --> 13:45.724
(sneezing):
Frasier!

13:46.125 --> 13:48.093
...but Legal says that we have to do this,

13:48.427 --> 13:51.297
so here's Van Andrews
from "Harassment Solutions."

13:53.132 --> 13:54.633
...
Okay, guys

13:54.633 --> 13:57.636
I'm Van,
I'll be your facilitator

13:57.636 --> 14:00.139
and if you could go ahead and
just open up your workbooks,

14:00.139 --> 14:02.141
we'll get started on building

14:02.141 --> 14:05.477
a truly gender-neutral
workplace, okay?

14:07.046 --> 14:10.115
Now, who wants to meet
my puppets?

14:10.616 --> 14:11.951
(everyone groaning)

14:23.262 --> 14:25.831
STEVE:
Wow, this is great!

14:25.831 --> 14:27.266
I like coming over to your house.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.335
It's really nice.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.472
Thanks.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.441
since we're doing stuff
at each other's houses now

14:35.841 --> 14:38.844
Uh, thanks for the offer, Steve,
but this isn't a social call

14:38.844 --> 14:40.813
We're having
our regular session.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.581
I really
want this to feel

14:42.848 --> 14:43.916
just like the office.

14:43.916 --> 14:44.917
Okay. Um..

14:45.351 --> 14:47.253
Well, I've been having
my dream again. Uh...

14:47.519 --> 14:48.087
(knocking)

14:48.587 --> 14:50.089
Uh, yes?

14:50.089 --> 14:51.423
Sorry to interrupt,
Dr. Crane

14:51.657 --> 14:53.125
but I got to run
these toilet fixtures

14:53.459 --> 14:54.026
past you.

14:54.526 --> 14:55.527
Your wife said you definitely

14:55.527 --> 14:56.829
want to be consulted about that.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.631
STEVE:
I never pictured you

14:59.031 --> 15:02.034
having a bathroom!

15:03.936 --> 15:05.337
Um, it isn't a good time

15:05.704 --> 15:06.772
If you...

15:06.772 --> 15:08.774
I'm sorry, I didn't realize your session had begun.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.776
Why don't you just wait
in the living room?

15:10.776 --> 15:12.278
Okay, but just
so you know

15:12.278 --> 15:14.113
the heated seat you want's on back order.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.716
Again, I'm sorry, Niles, but while I have you here

15:17.716 --> 15:19.685
do you want anything
from the shops?

15:19.685 --> 15:20.686
No. I'm good.

15:20.686 --> 15:21.620
Okay, then I'm off.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.057
Happy therapy.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
(clears throat)

15:31.096 --> 15:32.898
So, back to your dream.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.233
Your wife seems nice.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.235
She's foreign.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.137
That's weird.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.306
And then, I guess it shouldn't be.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.074
I mean, it would only make sense

15:42.074 --> 15:44.076
that you have a wife
and a bathroom and...

15:44.076 --> 15:46.078
and you probably have
a bed and laundry

15:46.578 --> 15:47.980
and that thing
I can't talk about.

15:48.414 --> 15:48.948
Refrigerator.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.863
Right.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.487
Okay, well, we're not really here to learn about my life,

15:55.487 --> 15:58.390
we're here to talk about you,
so... back to your dream.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.793
Okay, um, well,
I'm in this forest...

16:00.793 --> 16:01.794
(phone rings)

16:01.794 --> 16:03.295
Do you want to get that, or...?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.130
Nope, nope, it's okay.
The machine'll get it.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.966
Uh, now, you remember,
as we discussed

16:07.466 --> 16:09.935
the forest could be a symbol
of uncharted territory.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.704
Um, could be...

16:11.904 --> 16:13.472
DAPHNE (on machine):
♪♪ Nobody's home... ♪♪

16:13.472 --> 16:16.942
NILES (on machine):
♪♪ Nobody's home... ♪♪

16:17.242 --> 16:20.813
BOTH ("Beethoven'’’s Fifth"):
♪♪ Nobody's home, nobody's home,
nobody's home ♪♪

16:20.813 --> 16:23.749
♪♪ Nobody's home,
nobody's home, nobody's home ♪♪

16:24.083 --> 16:27.886
♪♪ We'll call you back,

16:27.886 --> 16:30.289
♪♪ After you hear

16:36.662 --> 16:39.164
So, uh, next week at your place.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.166
(weak laugh)

16:42.668 --> 16:45.671
Okay, Bulldog, in this exercise,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.674
we're going to pretend that you have an
attraction to Roz.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.509
Is that okay?

16:50.809 --> 16:53.379
Well, Van, I feel
a little uncomfortable

16:53.379 --> 16:55.881
about violating
her personal space

16:55.881 --> 16:59.818
even for role-playing, but... okay.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.287
Okay, Roz.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.289
Bring it on.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.790
Ok

17:05.790 --> 17:06.791
Go.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.227
Good morning, Roz.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.662
You're looking
professional today

17:11.964 --> 17:14.233
Thank you, Bulldog.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.733
You're looking
professional today, also.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.170
Why, thank you.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.140
After work, would you care to join me for a coffee

17:21.140 --> 17:23.642
or non-stimulating beverage?

17:24.143 --> 17:26.512
Please note you retain the option to say no

17:26.512 --> 17:29.148
Excellent, Bulldog.
Roz?

17:29.148 --> 17:31.417
Thank you, Bulldog,
for you offer,

17:31.417 --> 17:33.419
but I'm uncomfortable with it

17:33.419 --> 17:36.755
as I would prefer to cut
my own arm off and eat it.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.227
Can I have a turn with her?

17:42.227 --> 17:43.495
No, sorry, buddy.

17:43.495 --> 17:44.897
She's not your property!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.398
It's up to Van!
I want a turn!

17:46.398 --> 17:47.399
BULLDOG:
Sit down, Noel

17:47.399 --> 17:49.368
Oh, oh, what are you
going to do, huh?

17:49.368 --> 17:50.903
Oh, what are you
going to do?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.405
Guys, guys, let's keep our dialoguing constructive, okay?

17:53.405 --> 17:54.373
I think we're done here.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.874
Why don't you go ahead and..

17:56.408 --> 17:57.376
Oh, great.

17:57.376 --> 17:58.377
...have a
seat, okay?

18:00.546 --> 18:02.481
Um, I'd like to say something.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.715
Okay, go ahead, Gil.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.724
From the bottom of my heart,

18:12.724 --> 18:15.727
I apologize for
my wandering eye
over the years.

18:15.727 --> 18:19.731
Those whom I mentally undressed and...

18:19.731 --> 18:21.733
you know who you are..

18:22.167 --> 18:24.636
all I can say-- and it's a poor defense--

18:24.970 --> 18:28.540
is that I was a product of the thoughtless
machismo of my times.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.042
Thank you, Gil.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.044
But know this:

18:32.044 --> 18:36.048
Gil isn't about to stop loving the ladies.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.917
VAN:
Uh, thank you, Gil

18:39.251 --> 18:41.320
I think they like
to be called women now.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.255
Ha! Do they ever!

18:47.493 --> 18:49.995
How much longer do we have
to sit for this nonsense?!

18:49.995 --> 18:51.296
Well, Frasier

18:51.563 --> 18:53.132
since you're the one
who brought us here today

18:53.565 --> 18:57.136
maybe you'd like to take a turn in the
warm seat, hmm?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.638
Julia, would you be comfortable
 in helping Frasier

18:59.638 --> 19:01.640
learn how he could
have related to you

19:01.640 --> 19:03.509
in a more office-
appropriate manner?

19:03.842 --> 19:05.844
Uh... Julia?

19:06.278 --> 19:09.848
She's playing solitaire
on her palm pilot, Van.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.351
Oh, all right.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.126
VAN:
Okay..

19:21.393 --> 19:23.962
in this "no-fault" rewind

19:24.463 --> 19:27.466
let's find out
how Frasier assaulted you.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.468
I did not
assault her!

19:29.468 --> 19:31.470
I simply expressed unhappiness that

19:31.470 --> 19:33.739
she was taking 15
minutes from my show.

19:33.939 --> 19:36.475
She responded by
belittling my profession.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.443
And then he called me
a couple of names

19:38.443 --> 19:39.444
and asked
if I was turned on.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.412
VAN:
Okay, gang

19:40.812 --> 19:43.382
where did Frasier go wrong?

19:43.382 --> 19:44.850
(murmuring, snapping fingers)

19:45.284 --> 19:46.351
Uh, Bulldog.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.755
People stopped saying
"turned on" 20 years ago.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.690
No, look, look!

19:51.690 --> 19:54.993
I just misread
her... her signals!

19:55.294 --> 19:59.598
I-I thought that
her hostility was
displaced attraction.

19:59.831 --> 20:00.899
No, it was just hostility.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.401
Well, of course it was

20:02.401 --> 20:03.769
That's all the
re is to you.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.637
Ever since you arrived
at this station

20:05.637 --> 20:07.639
we have reached out to you
in friendship

20:07.639 --> 20:09.141
and all we've gotten in return

20:09.141 --> 20:10.943
is arrogance
and unbridled rudeness!

20:11.143 --> 20:13.212
It's not rudeness,
it's indifference.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.214
I'm sorry I'm not joining your bowling team

20:15.214 --> 20:17.182
but this is just a pit stop
for me.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.718
I do not intend on spending
the rest of my life

20:19.718 --> 20:22.554
at a station that cuts out
whenever the janitor vacuums!

20:22.854 --> 20:23.922
Ooh.

20:23.922 --> 20:24.890
No offense

20:25.324 --> 20:27.392
None taken.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.860
And I don't even
know why we're here.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.395
I'm not going to sue your stupid station.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.863
I mean, how pathetic
would that look?

20:32.264 --> 20:33.332
How dare you.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.168
At KACL, we are a family.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.503
Every person in this room respects one another..

20:38.503 --> 20:40.005
No, no, no, hold on
a second, Doc.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.406
I'll handle this.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.342
You mentioned something about
not suing us.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.309
Would you put that in writing?

20:44.710 --> 20:45.677
If it gets us out of here.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.546
Sure. That should satisfy Legal.

20:47.546 --> 20:48.547
(happy murmuring)

20:48.547 --> 20:50.048
Okay, wait, wait.

20:50.048 --> 20:53.051
This course isn't about Legal, okay?

20:53.051 --> 20:54.553
It's about making respecting

20:54.553 --> 20:56.054
each other's
personhood fun

20:56.054 --> 20:57.556
ROZ:
Up yours!

20:58.090 --> 20:58.557
Who said that?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.058
ROZ:
I did!

21:06.365 --> 21:08.433
You know, you can act
as tough as you want

21:08.433 --> 21:09.701
but I see through you.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.436
Really.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.406
You're not in the
big leagues anymore.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.408
Blame it on the market

21:16.408 --> 21:18.910
Blame it on bad luck.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.912
But somewhere in the
back of your head

21:20.912 --> 21:22.414
is that nagging voice that keeps saying

21:22.414 --> 21:24.182
maybe you weren't good enough.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.785
And now that you are here,

21:27.052 --> 21:28.120
you won't form relationships

21:28.120 --> 21:29.621
You keep everybody
at arm's length.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.622
Anything to convince yourself

21:31.123 --> 21:34.126
that this is just a stop
along the way.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.128
And above it all,

21:36.128 --> 21:39.598
I think you're terrified that
you're going to fail here, too

21:42.067 --> 21:43.068
Then what do I know?

21:43.502 --> 21:48.073
I'm just a magic eight ball with a Harvard...

21:48.073 --> 21:50.876
and Oxford degree.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.615
It's 45 past the hour

21:56.615 --> 21:59.117
which means it's time once again for the woman who...

21:59.117 --> 22:00.118
(clears throat)

22:00.118 --> 22:02.154
.
...is known
as Julia Wilcox

22:02.154 --> 22:03.655
Thank you, Frasier.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.657
Another up day
for the markets.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.160
But first, these words
from Patriot Credit
Consolidators.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.162
How many times
do I have to tell you

22:10.629 --> 22:12.664
you need to get
a comfortable chair in here.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.467
My leg keeps falling asleep
while I'm on the air.

22:15.734 --> 22:16.802
Who doesn't?

22:23.308 --> 22:24.643
Frasier...

22:24.910 --> 22:26.978
perhaps if you're
at Nervosa later,

22:26.978 --> 22:29.481
I could join you
for a cup of coffee?

22:29.481 --> 22:32.984
Or a non-stimulating beverage?

22:34.986 --> 22:37.823
Please note you retain
the option to say no.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.158
I appreciate that.

22:40.659 --> 22:45.163
And, in time, I believe we will
be able to establish a...

22:45.163 --> 22:47.499
a collegial relationship.

22:47.733 --> 22:48.800
However, I think we
should both acknowledge

22:49.301 --> 22:51.069
the feelings of hostility that remain between us...

22:51.069 --> 22:54.206
Oh, just say no.
Honestly, do you ever shut up?

22:54.506 --> 22:55.073
Now, see here, I..

22:55.574 --> 22:57.075
The rich got richer
today on Wall Street.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.711
Not news, ordinarily,
but after their recent slide,

22:59.711 --> 23:01.580
today's rally
in large cap

23:01.580 --> 23:04.583
does take on a certain
"man bites dog" quality.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.051
Speaking of dogs...

23:09.554 --> 23:11.423

the blues a-calling ♪♪

23:11.423 --> 23:14.826

23:32.310 --> 23:35.247
Frasier has left the building.
