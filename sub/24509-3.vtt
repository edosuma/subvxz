00:19.102 --> 00:22.564
<i>From the outside, it looks like a fable.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:28.528
<i>A story of tradition.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:32.532
<i>A family born into a restaurant.</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:38.413
<i>A new restaurant built by three brothers.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:45.295
<i>A great restaurant</i>
<i>with a great reputation.</i>

00:49.674 --> 00:52.469
<i>But it's not what it seems.</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:56.264
<i>It's never that easy.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:00.977
<i>I am much younger than my brothers.</i>

01:02.645 --> 01:07.567
<i>They weren't my parents,</i>
<i>although they acted like they were.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:13.073
<i>I felt small. Inferior.</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:18.078
<i>There was no place for me. That was clear.</i>

01:27.712 --> 01:32.675
<i>I didn't want to be Josep's waiter</i>
<i>or Joan's cook.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:40.767
<i>I was exploring.</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:09.397
What's going on?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.652
You're so late! Are you coming from Tokyo?

03:16.988 --> 03:18.781
Have you put salt in it, Joan?

03:24.162 --> 03:26.247
Okay. Ready.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.958
Wait.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.422
Now!

03:34.505 --> 03:36.007
Because he says so.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.345
This needs two people.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.847
Not only you! You need two people!

03:49.062 --> 03:53.358
<i>The story of the Roca brothers</i>
<i>is a story of family.</i>

03:53.900 --> 03:57.612
You have been very brave!

03:58.738 --> 04:04.202
They still live in the neighborhood
they grew up in.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.668
They have their restaurant there,
in the suburbs of Girona.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.129
Come, come in. Like you're at home.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.636
<i>Their restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca,</i>
<i>has 3 Michelin stars.</i>

04:21.719 --> 04:22.971
How are you?

04:23.471 --> 04:25.598
<i>But they still have daily staff lunch</i>

04:25.682 --> 04:27.892
<i>at their parents' restaurant.</i>

04:30.728 --> 04:34.357
<i>The Roca brothers' restaurant,</i>
<i>El Celler de Can Roca, </i>

04:34.440 --> 04:39.112
is one of the most extraordinary
restaurants on the planet.

04:48.663 --> 04:54.419
<i>The secret is that each one</i>
<i>of the brothers are real experts</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:55.753
of their world.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.136
<i>For food, there's Joan.</i>

05:05.596 --> 05:08.725
<i>For wine, there's Josep.</i>

05:10.226 --> 05:12.979
<i>For pastry, there's Jordi.</i>

05:18.651 --> 05:20.987
<i>Of all the restaurants</i>
<i>in the world that I know,</i>

05:21.070 --> 05:26.200
<i>the desserts that I love the most,</i>
<i>I'd say, are Jordi Roca's desserts.</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:33.374
There is a creative freedom
that is absolutely exceptional.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.588
<i>However...</i>

05:39.338 --> 05:42.675
<i>Jordi's story is a curious one.</i>

05:44.427 --> 05:47.722
<i>On the one side, there were his brothers.</i>

05:47.805 --> 05:50.308
<i>They already had their story,</i>
<i>their restaurant.</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:54.562
<i>And on the other side,</i>
<i>is the great question:</i>

05:57.899 --> 06:00.193
<i>Dedicate himself</i>
<i>to the profession of his brothers</i>

06:00.276 --> 06:02.487
<i>or do something else?</i>

06:03.863 --> 06:07.742
<i>Jordi didn't know where to aim.</i>

06:10.745 --> 06:14.415
He found himself in a no-man's-land.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.690
Let's do it.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.070
<i>My case is strange.</i>

06:45.363 --> 06:49.784
About a year ago, I had laryngitis.

06:49.867 --> 06:54.455
It passed, but my voice was still hoarse.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.626
<i>It's like a tic in the larynx.</i>

06:59.168 --> 07:00.920
<i>I can't control it.</i>

07:04.006 --> 07:08.886
<i>It deprives you of your natural form</i>
<i>of communication.</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:16.269
<i>But there are two ways of seeing this.</i>

07:17.395 --> 07:20.022
<i>For me, it is a limitation.</i>

07:21.107 --> 07:27.697
We need to remove it quickly
because it sticks quickly.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.074
<i>But on the positive side,</i>

07:30.908 --> 07:34.287
not speaking helps you learn a lot.

07:41.335 --> 07:46.632
<i>I only say what I think is important.</i>

07:49.635 --> 07:52.472
<i>I speak when necessary.</i>

07:55.766 --> 07:57.727
<i>It's been a handicap.</i>

07:59.562 --> 08:02.482
<i>But I'm growing as a person.</i>

08:04.525 --> 08:07.069
<i>Taking this condition,</i>

08:07.153 --> 08:09.280
<i>and trying to turn the table,</i>

08:09.363 --> 08:11.866
<i>as I do with the desserts, with the ideas.</i>

08:12.408 --> 08:14.076
<i>Being rebellious.</i>

08:15.828 --> 08:17.955
<i>Being provocative.</i>

08:20.249 --> 08:22.585
<i>Let's think the other way around.</i>

08:24.962 --> 08:29.050
<i>Set out unusual things.</i>

08:32.303 --> 08:36.641
<i>It's a kind of silent life</i>
<i>I've been forced to live.</i>

08:41.896 --> 08:46.609
<i>But I am saying much more in my work.</i>

08:50.571 --> 08:52.865
That is incredible.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.600
Enjoy your meal.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.227
-Thanks.
-Should I bring some water?

09:21.310 --> 09:23.271
Yes, if you don't mind.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.738
I became a cook accidentally.

09:34.490 --> 09:38.452
<i>When I got married, I worked</i>
<i>in the kitchen with my mother-in-law</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:40.288
<i>in her family restaurant.</i>

09:41.289 --> 09:44.166
And that's when I dedicated
myself to the kitchen.

09:49.005 --> 09:54.677
<i>My husband was working as a bus driver, </i>
<i>a job he liked very much.</i>

09:57.305 --> 10:01.309
And he saw this place for sale,
where we have the restaurant now.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.608
<i>By the time Joan was 10, 12 years old,</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:10.693
<i>he'd already told me</i>
<i>that he wanted to be a cook.</i>

10:10.776 --> 10:13.821
<i>I asked him, "Are you sure?"</i>
<i>"Yes! Yes! Yes!"</i>

10:14.363 --> 10:17.241
<i>I had two chef's jackets</i>
<i>custom-made for him,</i>

10:17.325 --> 10:19.577
<i>because there weren't any in his size.</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:23.789
<i>At 14, I entered cooking school.</i>

10:24.749 --> 10:27.543
My grandmother wanted me to be a banker,

10:27.627 --> 10:33.215
because banks are air-conditioned,
and people sit at their desks.

10:34.592 --> 10:40.264
<i>Josep studied at cooking school</i>
<i>and, when he finished, he came back here.</i>

10:40.348 --> 10:45.811
<i>At that point we decided,</i>
<i>"Why don't we open a restaurant here?"</i>

10:47.355 --> 10:49.732
<i>Joan and I decided to open a restaurant </i>

10:49.815 --> 10:53.486
<i>when Joan was 22 and I was 20.</i>

10:54.779 --> 11:00.826
Since the age of 12, we worked
in our parents' restaurant regularly.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.831
<i>For us, it was something normal,</i>
<i>something natural.</i>

11:10.252 --> 11:12.463
It is the story of our family.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.512
<i>We had our path in front of us.</i>

11:39.407 --> 11:42.660
Now you versus us.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.083
<i>I was 42 years old when I had Jordi.</i>

11:50.709 --> 11:53.921
<i>Josep is 12 years older</i>
<i>and Joan is 14 years older.</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:56.215
<i>When I realized I was pregnant,</i>

11:56.298 --> 12:00.678
I said, "So nice!
I'm going to be a mother again!"

12:03.681 --> 12:08.602
<i>When our mother said</i>
<i>that she was pregnant, it was...</i>

12:10.271 --> 12:13.274
a shock. We didn't expect it.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.069
<i>I remember perfectly well.</i>

12:17.153 --> 12:19.738
<i>I was in the kitchen. I was studying.</i>

12:19.822 --> 12:22.366
<i>I saw her happy, excited.</i>

12:24.952 --> 12:30.291
<i>We didn't know then</i>
<i>if it was going to be a boy or girl,</i>

12:30.374 --> 12:32.710
but, in the end, it was Jordi.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.009
<i>I love them and appreciate them, but...</i>

12:40.593 --> 12:43.721
<i>I always felt a bit different.</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:45.639
<i>Separate.</i>

12:46.724 --> 12:50.603
<i>It was hard when I grew up,</i>
<i>because everyone laughed at me.</i>

12:53.105 --> 12:56.317
<i>My nose, it has brought many problems</i>
<i>because, as a child,</i>

12:56.400 --> 12:59.361
I developed my nose
much earlier than my face,

12:59.445 --> 13:04.033
<i>so that I had this huge nose,</i>
<i>enormous in proportion to my head.</i>

13:06.076 --> 13:10.206
<i>At home, my brothers would say,</i>
<i>"Hey, big nose, come over here!"</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:13.667
<i>Even my mother was like,</i>
<i>"What a big nose!"</i>

13:14.835 --> 13:17.004
<i>The typical joke was</i>
<i>I'm sitting in the chair,</i>

13:17.087 --> 13:20.633
and my brothers called, "Jordi!"
I turned and everyone crouched.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.760
And I thought, "Fucking assholes."

13:27.348 --> 13:29.308
It was unbearable.

13:40.736 --> 13:45.533
<i>Girona is a wonderful city,</i>
<i>exactly between</i>

13:45.616 --> 13:51.372
<i>the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees.</i>

13:58.379 --> 14:00.798
It's the best city in the world
in which to live and to cook.

14:08.138 --> 14:11.225
Jordi finds inspiration in aromas.

14:16.313 --> 14:23.028
<i>Fragrances that are in the environment,</i>
<i>in the forest,</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:26.866
<i>in the natural surroundings.</i>

14:39.628 --> 14:43.757
<i>When it seems like nothing new </i>
<i>can emerge...</i>

14:44.341 --> 14:47.970
Bam! A new dish comes

14:48.554 --> 14:53.058
<i>from that inspiration.</i>

14:57.688 --> 15:03.360
<i>Manel, the sheep farmer, came to see us.</i>

15:04.820 --> 15:08.240
And he brought us some sheep's milk
from the Ripollesa breed.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.622
They don't make much milk,

15:14.705 --> 15:18.042
but the quality of the breed
and the protein have an awesome flavor.

15:19.335 --> 15:23.172
He had decided to import them
and rescue the breed.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.632
<i>It was completely new.</i>

15:26.675 --> 15:29.470
<i>At the restaurant, we wanted to make</i>
<i>a new dulce de leche</i>

15:29.553 --> 15:31.889
with that sheep's milk.
It was rare. It was new.

15:38.270 --> 15:44.234
<i>This was around the time</i>
<i>my nephew Marti was born.</i>

15:52.326 --> 15:55.955
<i>When I would smell him,</i>
<i>Marti would smell like milk.</i>

16:04.421 --> 16:05.756
It was a tender moment.

16:09.343 --> 16:15.516
<i>That sheep's milk makes a dulce de leche</i>
<i>with a spectacular sweetness.</i>

16:19.603 --> 16:23.524
And we said, "With this dulce de leche,
we need to make a dessert."

16:26.652 --> 16:30.572
<i>We made a dessert</i>
<i>based on the elements of that sheep.</i>

16:35.411 --> 16:39.289
<i>There's a base</i>
<i>of sheep's milk dulce de leche,</i>

16:39.373 --> 16:42.668
<i>a foam of sheep's milk cheese,</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:48.007
<i>sheep's milk ice cream.</i>

16:53.804 --> 17:00.269
<i>Another part is the cotton candy cloud,</i>
<i>like sheep's wool.</i>

17:03.105 --> 17:07.568
All babies smell like milk
when you smell their heads.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.654
They do so because that's what they eat.

17:12.990 --> 17:18.829
<i>This dish is a tribute to that tenderness.</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:22.458
<i>It's like putting a baby to bed.</i>

18:00.621 --> 18:02.122
Churro!

18:07.920 --> 18:10.214
-Good!
-Good!

18:10.756 --> 18:15.052
<i>Jordi was naughty,</i>
<i>a naughty boy, yes, yes.</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:19.389
<i>It's normal. They all do it.</i>

18:19.973 --> 18:23.143
But, well, what are we going to do?
He is like that.

18:25.854 --> 18:29.942
<i>Jordi's situation is probably</i>
<i>the most complicated of the three of us.</i>

18:30.609 --> 18:32.069
With Jordi, there's distance.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.613
<i>He practically belongs</i>
<i>to a different generation.</i>

18:35.614 --> 18:38.700
<i>But the truth is that,</i>
<i>when we started the restaurant,</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:41.954
we were expecting Jordi to work here,

18:42.037 --> 18:45.457
<i>but we did not know if he would be</i>
<i>fully committed to this.</i>

18:49.128 --> 18:52.756
I wasn't clear about what I wanted to do.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.387
<i>My brothers spent the day</i>
<i>in the restaurant putting out fires,</i>

18:58.470 --> 19:02.015
<i>doing so much. I didn't get it.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:05.602
I thought, "This is not for me.
These guys are crazy."

19:16.738 --> 19:23.162
<i>I ended up as a waiter</i>
<i>because it was where they needed help.</i>

19:26.915 --> 19:28.959
<i>I was 19 or 20.</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:37.092
<i>I was just partying, going to the disco,</i>
<i>getting drunk like any teenager.</i>

19:39.636 --> 19:43.807
A lot, like everyone.
I just did a little more.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.608
<i>I would finish working</i>
<i>at 2:00 in the morning,</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:54.776
<i>because the waiters finished last.</i>

19:58.280 --> 20:01.158
<i>And so I said I wanted</i>
<i>to be in the kitchen.</i>

20:04.995 --> 20:08.040
<i>I became a cook, so I could leave earlier.</i>

20:12.211 --> 20:15.297
<i>I viewed my work as just a job.</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:20.510
<i>Afterwards, I forgot about it.</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:28.393
But they noticed it because,
when I was working,

20:28.477 --> 20:31.939
<i>I made mistakes and I didn't care.</i>

20:36.610 --> 20:39.571
<i>It was because I didn't see</i>
<i>a future with them.</i>

20:41.281 --> 20:47.120
<i>I didn't see myself, in ten years,</i>
<i>being in a partnership with them.</i>

20:57.089 --> 20:59.216
<i>I was part of the family,</i>

20:59.299 --> 21:05.681
<i>so feeling apart from them was hard.</i>

21:08.517 --> 21:13.272
By inertia, he came to work with us
without having any conviction.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.862
<i>He knows that,</i>
<i>"My brothers are going to give me work.</i>

21:22.072 --> 21:23.407
I'll have something to do."

21:26.243 --> 21:29.955
He'd try to leave as early as possible,

21:30.038 --> 21:34.543
sometimes without finishing
what he was doing.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.089
<i>There was no spark inside Jordi.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:42.342
<i>There was no passion.</i>

22:15.876 --> 22:17.210
Very good.

22:17.878 --> 22:22.257
To try... I don't know.
I prefer the yellow one, huh? Than gold.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.259
I don't know. What do you think?

22:32.476 --> 22:35.812
There were two purees.
A cocoa one and a...

22:35.896 --> 22:36.897
Cupuaçu.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.651
The Cupuaçu... it's better.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.697
It's much more powerful.
From the cocoa family.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.582
In the end, the effect
we are looking for is this.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.087
This pulp. The bean.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.632
Yeah, it's almost the reverse.

23:04.174 --> 23:07.177
The pulp, the outside of the seed.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.179
We'll make this.

24:03.525 --> 24:10.323
<i>When Damian arrived, I worked with him,</i>
<i>because he and Joan asked me to.</i>

24:10.866 --> 24:15.162
But I noticed Damian cooked fun things.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.921
<i>He was passionate about what he did.</i>

24:26.256 --> 24:27.299
And I could feel it.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.187
When I started with my brothers
in the restaurant,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.856
<i>I was treated like the boss' son, </i>

24:44.024 --> 24:46.693
<i>and it was bad for me.</i>

24:48.612 --> 24:52.115
<i>Damian spoke to me man-to-man, </i>
<i>like a normal person.</i>

24:52.657 --> 24:56.369
<i>And when I had trouble concentrating,</i>
he'd yell at me.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.414
He'd say, "Jordi-fucking-Roca!"

25:04.127 --> 25:06.713
He'd insult me, and I'd say, "Okay, okay!"

25:07.505 --> 25:10.759
<i>But it was like I deserved it,</i>
<i>and I knew I deserved it.</i>

25:19.643 --> 25:21.978
When we were cooking a petit four,

25:25.523 --> 25:28.693
<i>I had to work quick,</i>
<i>so everything would be stable.</i>

25:29.236 --> 25:33.114
<i>But one day, I got excited because,</i>
<i>at a certain temperature, the jelly set.</i>

25:33.657 --> 25:37.160
<i>When he told me the reason</i>
<i>why we did that, in that way,</i>

25:37.244 --> 25:41.581
<i>I understood the importance</i>
<i>of the details.</i>

25:42.165 --> 25:44.584
And I said, "Wow! I like it!"

25:56.429 --> 25:58.723
<i>I understood the game of the kitchen.</i>

26:01.643 --> 26:04.104
<i>I understood the passion of my brothers.</i>

26:30.297 --> 26:33.133
<i>We like to take walks</i>
<i>around the Llémena Valley.</i>

26:37.762 --> 26:41.266
<i>It's the part of Girona</i>
<i>where our parents were born.</i>

26:44.686 --> 26:48.732
We go and gather the dirt around there,
because this is the dirt that

26:49.649 --> 26:54.404
<i>we used to play in as children.</i>

26:59.826 --> 27:05.415
<i>Dirt appears in our cooking</i>
<i>as a way to explain a feeling, </i>

27:05.957 --> 27:09.794
<i>to describe nostalgia or melancholy.</i>

27:15.342 --> 27:18.970
We all have that aroma of moist earth
in our memory.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.515
<i>All of us.</i>

27:23.141 --> 27:24.726
<i>From any culture.</i>

27:27.103 --> 27:29.522
That's why this ingredient is so magical.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.612
<i>I always wanted to have</i>
<i>a dish that I had lived,</i>

27:36.404 --> 27:39.240
<i>that connects me with that memory...</i>

27:41.576 --> 27:47.123
of going back to a place
that connects us all with our origin.

27:51.336 --> 27:55.965
<i>It's a trip to a forest</i>
<i>where it had just rained.</i>

28:02.263 --> 28:08.395
<i>Everyone has played with soil</i>
<i>and accidentally eaten it,</i>

28:08.478 --> 28:11.898
and so that flavor is here
in the hypothalamus,

28:11.981 --> 28:15.819
<i>where the most primitive</i>
<i>childhood memories are.</i>

28:15.902 --> 28:18.822
<i>And it touched those memories.</i>

28:26.538 --> 28:28.706
<i>Through the distillation process,</i>

28:28.790 --> 28:33.336
<i>dirt turns into</i>
<i>an extraordinarily important ingredient.</i>

28:40.719 --> 28:44.764
Jordi, with his dessert,

28:44.848 --> 28:51.479
<i>has made this flavor of moist earth</i>
<i>make sense.</i>

28:52.021 --> 28:54.149
When you taste it,

28:54.232 --> 28:57.318
<i>you're transported to a different place.</i>

28:59.320 --> 29:01.906
<i>The Rainy Forest... </i>
<i>They say it's a dessert, </i>

29:01.990 --> 29:04.242
but I actually believe
it's a great surprise.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.791
<i>And when the dessert arrives at the table,</i>

29:11.875 --> 29:14.586
<i>the big surprise is how, </i>

29:14.669 --> 29:19.299
<i>from a little ball of ice</i>
<i>in front of the customer,</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:21.843
<i>a stalagmite is created.</i>

29:26.431 --> 29:30.101
So it's the surprise. It's the game.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.853
It's very Jordi.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.965
<i>After eight, nine months,</i>
<i>Damian taught me a lot.</i>

30:01.049 --> 30:03.134
<i>But I knew I needed to learn more.</i>

30:05.595 --> 30:08.556
<i>It was summer. It was June or July.</i>

30:10.642 --> 30:12.811
<i>I was living above Can Roca.</i>

30:15.355 --> 30:19.359
<i>It was morning, and I woke up at 9:15.</i>

30:19.442 --> 30:22.028
I looked out the window.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.948
I saw a waiter in the parking lot.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.745
<i>And he yelled up, "Jordi, did you hear</i>
<i>what happened to Damian?"</i>

30:31.871 --> 30:33.289
I was scared.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.295
It was terrible chaos.

30:42.632 --> 30:46.094
Damian Allsop, our pastry chef,
had an accident.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.102
<i>One night, he left his keys at home.</i>

30:55.687 --> 31:02.235
<i>And he fell from the third floor,</i>
<i>trying to climb to his balcony.</i>

31:31.180 --> 31:33.016
<i>I had to make the decision.</i>

31:33.099 --> 31:36.311
It's certainly
a very important responsibility.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.858
<i>I didn't want to have to put</i>
<i>pressure on Jordi.</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:47.530
I was in a panic.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.120
<i>My anxiety rose. My stomach burned.</i>

31:56.414 --> 31:58.666
<i>My heart beat fast as hell.</i>

31:59.918 --> 32:01.961
<i>What do I do? What do I do?</i>

32:03.338 --> 32:05.965
For the restaurant, I had to wake up.

32:17.101 --> 32:21.272
<i>Damian had a recipe file</i>
<i>where he had all his recipes.</i>

32:21.356 --> 32:23.691
<i>And all of them were in English.</i>

32:30.657 --> 32:33.368
I said, "Okay, let's do what I know."

32:38.039 --> 32:42.085
<i>I was forced to not do</i>
<i>one thing at a time,</i>

32:42.168 --> 32:46.047
<i>but, rather, I had to keep track</i>
<i>of 15 or 20 things at a time.</i>

32:47.799 --> 32:49.425
<i>I had to run more.</i>

32:50.802 --> 32:52.887
<i>Start to be more agile.</i>

32:59.185 --> 33:00.645
<i>My friends didn't understand.</i>

33:02.313 --> 33:05.692
<i>"What's happening to you?</i>
<i>Are you crazy? Let's go out!"</i>

33:06.275 --> 33:08.653
<i>I didn't want to go out partying.</i>

33:11.364 --> 33:16.786
I found myself leaving last,
but very happy.

33:49.819 --> 33:53.406
That would have to be like a jelly.
Not the Italian kind?

33:57.577 --> 34:01.581
<i>We were staying on top of Jordi</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

34:01.664 --> 34:04.834
We were watching. We were
very aware of what he was doing.

34:08.337 --> 34:12.008
<i>We had one Michelin star.</i>
<i>We had some recognition.</i>

34:12.550 --> 34:17.805
<i>And it was a risk having someone</i>
<i>who was just starting in the field.</i>

34:20.141 --> 34:24.645
In the beginning, Jordi was making
the desserts he learned from Damian.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.482
<i>They were not that bad.</i>

34:30.359 --> 34:34.489
But they were not extraordinary either.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.870
At that time, there was
much affection and partnership,

34:40.953 --> 34:44.540
much fraternity,
but not professional admiration.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.175
I remember the first time
I invented a dish.

34:57.804 --> 35:01.057
<i>It was for customers</i>
<i>who came every Thursday.</i>

35:04.602 --> 35:08.773
<i>They asked me to prepare</i>
<i>something new for them.</i>

35:11.526 --> 35:13.736
I said to myself, "What do I do now?"

35:15.822 --> 35:20.243
<i>I imagined a cream, a frozen mousse,</i>
<i>made of chocolate and raspberries,</i>

35:20.326 --> 35:21.369
<i>very basic.</i>

35:25.248 --> 35:27.542
<i>I imagined the taste in my head.</i>

35:28.626 --> 35:30.503
<i>It would be new.</i>

35:31.045 --> 35:32.505
<i>It would be fantastic.</i>

35:34.882 --> 35:39.220
<i>When I took it out of the freezer</i>
<i>and cut it and put it on the plate...</i>

35:42.181 --> 35:44.433
<i>it looked nothing</i>
<i>like what I had in my head.</i>

35:48.187 --> 35:53.234
<i>But the nice people who had it</i>
<i>understood I was learning.</i>

35:53.317 --> 35:55.653
<i>And for them, it's a good story.</i>

35:57.655 --> 35:59.574
But it was a piece of shit.

36:30.646 --> 36:36.569
<i>There was a moment when Jordi told us,</i>
<i>"I'm going to take an ice cream class, </i>

36:36.652 --> 36:40.406
because the subject is complicated
and I want to master it."

36:43.910 --> 36:44.952
<i>It was very important</i>

36:45.036 --> 36:48.331
because it's necessary to realize
that, actually, you don't know anything.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.754
<i>That whole week,</i>
<i>we only talked about ice cream.</i>

36:55.922 --> 36:59.967
<i>I didn't know it was possible</i>
<i>to go that in depth into ice cream.</i>

37:01.510 --> 37:05.640
<i>One day, the teacher talked about how</i>
<i>the air is important for an ice cream.</i>

37:06.140 --> 37:10.269
It is very important
that the air is completely clean.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.107
<i>So the ice cream does not absorb odors.</i>

37:15.191 --> 37:17.401
<i>So it does not add another flavor.</i>

37:19.487 --> 37:21.989
I went home
and thought the other way around.

37:29.288 --> 37:33.251
<i>At the time, smoking was permitted</i>
<i>in the restaurant.</i>

37:33.793 --> 37:35.586
Everyone smoked cigars,

37:35.670 --> 37:37.505
and I had that aroma in mind...

37:38.089 --> 37:40.800
the smell of tobacco,
whenever entering the restaurant.

37:43.094 --> 37:48.182
<i>And I imagined the machine in Can Roca</i>
<i>absorbing the scent of tobacco.</i>

37:50.268 --> 37:52.395
<i>And one day, in the morning,</i>

37:52.937 --> 37:54.272
<i>nobody was in the kitchen.</i>

37:56.524 --> 37:57.984
<i>I took a cigar.</i>

38:01.862 --> 38:05.074
I smoked the cigar and blew the smoke
into the ice cream machine,

38:05.157 --> 38:08.286
<i>so the ice cream captured</i>
<i>that part of the air.</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:20.423
<i>And in the afternoon,</i>
<i>I gave it to my brothers,</i>

38:20.506 --> 38:24.260
<i>and they tried it, and they were shocked.</i>

38:24.802 --> 38:25.970
<i>"What is this?"</i>

38:26.053 --> 38:27.680
"It tastes like smoke!"

38:30.099 --> 38:32.560
<i>It was weird, and it was new.</i>

38:32.643 --> 38:37.898
<i>I realized there was a world related</i>
<i>to the sense of smell.</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:42.570
<i>That dish became "The Journey to Havana."</i>

38:53.372 --> 38:54.999
<i>That dish of Jordi's...</i>

38:56.125 --> 38:59.128
<i>It's one of those beautiful things</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

39:02.298 --> 39:07.261
<i>It is one thing to find a way, a job,</i>
<i>and another thing to surprise.</i>

39:11.515 --> 39:15.853
<i>And the moment when Jordi</i>
<i>made "Journey to Havana"</i>

39:16.395 --> 39:20.566
is when Joan and I looked at Jordi
and said,

39:20.649 --> 39:24.570
"How?" "What?" Wow.

39:29.533 --> 39:34.914
<i>Jordi, at that moment,</i>
<i>contributed something more.</i>

39:34.997 --> 39:36.874
<i>It was the magic effect.</i>

39:37.875 --> 39:40.086
The effect of thinking differently,

39:40.169 --> 39:44.048
<i>of contrary thought,</i>
<i>of going against the current.</i>

39:47.385 --> 39:52.014
We understood
that inside our little brother

39:52.807 --> 39:54.683
there was a genius hiding.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.374
<i>Jordi had been chosen</i>
<i>Best Pastry Maker in the World.</i>

40:18.958 --> 40:23.421
<i>The Rocas have been recognized twice</i>
<i>as best restaurant in the world</i>

40:23.504 --> 40:25.381
<i>by The World's 50 Best.</i>

40:29.385 --> 40:32.763
<i>Their customers come</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>

40:33.305 --> 40:36.600
<i>When they got their third Michelin star,</i>

40:36.684 --> 40:41.063
<i>the people from the neighborhood</i>
<i>went there</i>

40:41.147 --> 40:45.943
and applauded them for ten minutes.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.903
And ten minutes is a long time.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.261
Hey, guys!

41:55.804 --> 41:57.515
It's party time.

42:10.152 --> 42:13.155
-How does this go?
-Let's go backwards.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.698
Backwards?

42:20.538 --> 42:22.831
Nice, nice. Backwards, or...

42:22.915 --> 42:24.875
<i>When I was nine years old,</i>

42:25.417 --> 42:27.419
<i>I loved ham.</i>

42:28.837 --> 42:32.550
I remember they had a ham
perfectly placed in the restaurant.

42:34.593 --> 42:35.803
You're doing it backwards!

42:35.886 --> 42:38.180
No, this is correct.

42:40.349 --> 42:43.310
<i>My brothers used to cut it, </i>

42:43.394 --> 42:48.274
<i>so that they left it absolutely smooth</i>

42:48.357 --> 42:51.986
<i>and they'd know if I'd placed my knife</i>
<i>on it and mashed it,</i>

42:52.069 --> 42:54.822
cut it the wrong way.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.577
Eat ham. Eat ham.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.664
But I couldn't avoid it.
It was stronger than me.

43:06.041 --> 43:08.752
<i>And that marked my life.</i>

43:13.716 --> 43:16.677
<i>Obviously, there's a before and after.</i>

43:20.347 --> 43:24.184
<i>The truth is Jordi brought</i>
<i>a profound change.</i>

43:24.727 --> 43:29.356
<i>I'm absolutely convinced</i>
<i>that our current success</i>

43:29.440 --> 43:33.527
has a lot to do with the talent
that Jordi brought.

43:37.781 --> 43:40.743
<i>Jordi makes</i>
<i>El Celler de Can Roca complete...</i>

43:43.203 --> 43:46.290
<i>makes it richer, with more vitality...</i>

43:49.084 --> 43:54.798
and he makes us grow in a different,
original way, in which three worlds unite.

44:05.142 --> 44:08.896
And this makes us different,
original and stronger.

44:12.191 --> 44:17.446
<i>Like these rocks,</i>
<i>which endure, mold, adapt.</i>

44:17.988 --> 44:22.076
<i>Different, but which have lived</i>
<i>the same course.</i>

44:31.919 --> 44:37.466
The door opened for me, and I thought,
"I can try new things and make mistakes."

44:41.095 --> 44:47.393
<i>I felt recognized. I felt like a grown-up.</i>
<i>I was part of the team.</i>

44:51.605 --> 44:54.817
<i>I realized this is my part.</i>
