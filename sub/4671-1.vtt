01:27.560 --> 01:30.928
I may have to jerk it
before we even get there.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.242
Not near me, please. Let me see.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.330
Who throws a party when his wife
leaves him on their honeymoon?

01:37.480 --> 01:39.528
Vince does. And why wouldn't he?

01:39.680 --> 01:42.126
I hope that's what
my next honeymoon's like.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.001
- Vince.
- Yo. Come in.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.930
- Hey.
- Your friends are here.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.447
Really? I didn't think they'd come.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.321
What?

02:05.520 --> 02:06.760
Let them wait.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.925
I just got out of a failed marriage. You're
gonna have to give me at least a few hours.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.050
Okay. A few.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.568
Ha-ha-ha! Hey, boys!

02:17.720 --> 02:19.370
- Hey, baby bro.
- Welcome.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.649
- I told you guys you didn't have to come.
- We were in Paris anyway.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.929
We wanted to make sure there wasn't
a Natalie Wood-type situation.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.201
I appreciate it.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.886
E did hesitate when we asked him
if he would help.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.162
- Jerk-off. We thought you were alone!
- I was.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.051
- Where'd you find the hotties?
- It's Ibiza. They found me.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.281
Come on.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.965
I like Ibiza, bro.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.724
- We'll be right back.
- Right back.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.211
Nobody leaves.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.684
Except you. You can go.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.243
- So, what happened?
- Just wasn't working.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.402
- After nine days?
- Sometimes you just know.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.922
- We all knew when you were saying, "I do."
- I know. I made a mistake.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.404
- It's not the shortest marriage in Hollywood.
- No. Britney Spears. Two days. I looked it up.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.642
- Thank you, Turtle.
- All right. So, what now?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.849
Easy. We're gonna get it annulled.
Trust me, it's all good.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.048
- And she agrees?
- She said it first.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.130
I mean, we're lying there looking at each other,
and we didn't have a thing to say.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.523
- Who does?
- And I'm thinking, "What did I do?"

03:10.680 --> 03:11.920
And then she said it.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.286
And then she just left?

03:13.440 --> 03:15.602
No, we had sex first,
agreed to be friends...

03:15.760 --> 03:18.331
went to sleep,
and when I woke up she was gone.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.766
She left this note.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.366
- What's it say?
- You're not gonna believe it.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.524
"I read the script for your next movie.
You're better than this."

03:27.680 --> 03:31.765
- They're doing another rewrite.
- I read it. She's right. It sucks. Let's get out of it.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.968
- It starts shooting next month.
- I know.

03:34.120 --> 03:37.408
I realized I rushed into marriage
because I'm searching for something.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.285
Something meaningful.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.683
I really need to do something different
than anything I've ever done.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.841
Yeah, me, too, bro.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.166
Ari says he's got something.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.606
Ari's retired.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.564
Isn't he?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.927
Fax? Fax.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.801
I can't print, scan or e-mail
because there's no Internet-o.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.044
I need to get back to civilization.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.964
Honey, can you take any longer to pack?

04:05.320 --> 04:08.085
Ari, do not push me,
or I'll change my mind again.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.006
I wouldn't push her, Dad.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.649
- Vinnie Chase.
- Ari Gold!

04:14.800 --> 04:18.168
Vegas odds had your retirement
lasting longer than my marriage.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.805
Well, good thing that I bet big
against both.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.485
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.530
And you? How'd you get the wife
to let you go back to work?

04:25.680 --> 04:26.966
Once she realized
that she couldn't understand...

04:27.160 --> 04:29.367
what the Real Housewives of Milan
were saying, she begged to go.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.727
- Ari.
- I'm not going back to work, Vinnie.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.771
I'm going back to be the king of Hollywood,
but I agreed to live by my queen's rules.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.169
One of which is to leave my nutsack
in the Mediterranean.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.288
- I heard that.
- Mm.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.566
But we're all good.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.728
Good. I hear you got something for me.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.484
Something big. My first movie...

04:46.680 --> 04:49.286
as studio head and, boom,
I want you to star in it.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.329
Oh, yeah? How badly?

04:51.480 --> 04:52.606
What do you mean?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.331
Because I decided whatever I do next...

04:55.520 --> 04:57.124
I also wanna direct.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.608
- Does he even know how to direct?
- Ari?

05:03.120 --> 05:04.485
Ari.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.171
Ari.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.961
Even if you've never seen
a Vincent Chase movie...

07:13.160 --> 07:14.924
chances are you've heard the name.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.284
The 34-year-old has 15 starring roles on his
résumé, including James Cameron's Aquaman...

07:19.440 --> 07:22.410
once the all-time box office champ.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.040
Chase hails from modest roots
in Queens, New York...

07:25.200 --> 07:29.285
where he was raised by a single mother,
surrounded by a group of loyal friends.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.807
Friends who still surround him today.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.727
We caught up with Chase and his entourage
on the set of his directorial debut, Hyde...

07:36.880 --> 07:38.484
Who's he calling an entourage?

07:38.680 --> 07:39.761
Not me. I'm a relative.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.844
...a modern-day retelling of Robert Louis
Stevenson's classic, Jekyll and Hyde.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.447
A film that some in the industry
are now whispering was too expensive...

07:46.600 --> 07:49.763
- ...to be put in the hands of a first-timer.
- Shut up.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.205
- Is that what people are saying?
- This is a big undertaking.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.210
Well, it's not that big.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.966
Though the sets are big.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.924
The sets are big. Enormous, in fact.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.124
No expense seems to have been spared
in turning Hollywood streets...

08:02.280 --> 08:04.521
into a futuristic Los Angeles nightmare.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.250
We wanted to surround Vince
with the best people in the business...

08:06.400 --> 08:09.244
- ...to make sure he was covered.
- That's Hyde producer Eric Murphy...

08:09.400 --> 08:12.324
Chase's longtime manager
and best friend since kindergarten.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.964
But what exactly were his qualifications
when Mr. Chase asked him to come on board?

08:17.120 --> 08:19.361
I was actually managing a Sbarro's.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.925
Sbarro's?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.684
Yeah. The pizza place.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.960
- This pizza place, in fact.
- Nice pic.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.248
Chase plucked Murphy away
from a life of spinning pies...

08:28.440 --> 08:29.680
I am gonna kill my mother.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.205
...and decided he was equipped...

08:31.400 --> 08:34.006
to help guide him through the treacherous
waters of Hollywood.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.679
- What did everybody else think?
- Heh.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.764
Well, my agent at the time,
he wasn't too happy.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.890
His agent at the time was none other
than Hollywood powerhouse Ari Gold...

08:44.080 --> 08:46.287
who has since moved on
from the agency business...

08:46.440 --> 08:49.171
and is now head of the studio
that is producing Hyde.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.369
You see it with pro athletes.
You see it with movie stars.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.366
They wanna share the ride with their friends.
It makes it feel more real for them.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.206
- Were you okay with this?
- No, I was not okay with it. I hated it.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.362
I found this kid
off a Mentos commercial.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.841
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.890
I was watching TV with the wife,
and I said, "This guy's a star."

09:11.000 --> 09:13.287
Mentos. The Freshmaker.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.681
- And you were right.
- I'm that good, Piers.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.366
It wasn't just Murphy
Gold was forced to deal with.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.922
There was Sal "Turtle" Assante,
another friend from the neighborhood...

09:22.120 --> 09:23.485
who became Vince's driver.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.847
I like to think I did more
than just drive.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.407
Yeah, he drove, he parked, he waited.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.886
He also made a fortune
in a tequila company...

09:31.040 --> 09:32.121
That's a good line.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.170
...when Chase helped him gain access
to billionaire Mark Cuban.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.367
How much did he make?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.568
He won't say. It's so annoying.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.444
And that's Chase's half-brother...

09:40.640 --> 09:42.768
- Why's he gotta say that?
- I know. He should've said quarter.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.970
- ...and actor, Johnny Chase.
- Victory!

09:47.120 --> 09:50.090
You've probably seen him,
he's been in just about everything.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.801
Melrose Place, Pacific Blue,
Law & Order.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.566
And the recently canceled
animated show, Johnny Bananas.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.167
I can't believe you did this, Ronald.
I'm so screwed.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.369
And today, he feels he may have
caught the break of a lifetime...

10:03.520 --> 10:05.727
as his younger brother cast him
in what he describes...

10:05.880 --> 10:08.611
as "a small but pivotal role" in Hyde.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.091
You came to Hollywood first?

10:10.240 --> 10:12.891
- I was the trailblazer.
- And then Vince followed?

10:13.040 --> 10:16.123
With Turtle. They lived in my house
rent-free for the first year.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.841
But, as I understand it,
you now live in Vince's house?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.530
I'm 40 years old and could possibly get
an Oscar nom this year.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.291
Why the **** would I live
at my baby brother's house?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.522
I can't believe you cursed
at Piers Morgan.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.364
I can't believe he just said
he might get an Oscar nom.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.086
I'm just staying there
till my roof gets reshingled.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.001
So I got the pizza boy,
the brother Fredo and a Turtle.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.130
Yet, somehow this sort of weird collection
of people, it worked.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.961
It did. And the truth is, their blind loyalty
to each other is kind of charming.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.640
Some people say you have
the same character traits.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.768
I like to think of myself as loyal,
but not blind.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.810
Yet, many were surprised
when you let Vince direct this movie.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.731
Many people were surprised when someone
let Mel Gibson direct Braveheart...

10:54.920 --> 10:58.083
or Kevin Costner direct Dances with Wolves.
They both won Oscars.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.322
But they weren't studio heads,
handing ex-clients...

11:00.880 --> 11:05.169
directorial debuts at a time
when the studio suffered its worst fiscal year...

11:05.640 --> 11:09.087
and without any tentpole franchise
to bolster the hemorrhaging losses.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.084
Listen, the year ain't over,
and this is a franchise picture.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.368
- Right, but you are way over budget.
- Where'd you hear that?

11:14.520 --> 11:17.922
Your neck is on the line, and so is Chase's.
You've gotta be worried.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.605
I don't worry. I just win.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.041
- I thought this was gonna be a fluff piece, Piers.
- No.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.164
No. Okay, great. Well, why don't we
turn those cameras off?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.527
- Is it hot in here?
- No, I'm good.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.364
I got Ang Lee from the set.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.080
Hey...

11:35.000 --> 11:36.240
You okay?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.846
- I don't usually worry, either.
- What are you worried about?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.924
- The movie will be great.
- I'm not worried about that.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.481
I'm worried about telling Ari that we need
more money to finish the movie.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.968
- Isn't it the producer's job to tell Ari that?
- Seriously, E.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.327
- I'll call him tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.090
- I'll call him.
- Fine.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.208
- So should we go out tonight?
- Definitely.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.210
- Yeah. I'm having a great hair day.
- I can't. I have plans.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.765
- With who?
- You don't know her.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.843
Does your soon-to-be baby mama know her?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.606
Drama, Sloan and I haven't been together
for six months.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.366
- You haven't been with anyone else.
- Like you'd know.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.682
- Come on. Who's the girl?
- Her name's Melanie.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.161
- I've been seeing her a few weeks.
- A few weeks?

12:11.320 --> 12:12.401
Jesus Christ.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.007
- This guy snuck into another relationship.
- It's not. I'm just having fun.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.891
Fun is when you forget a girl's name
while you're fucking her.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.929
No wonder he has no time for business.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.206
You know, we're almost 35.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.886
He's almost 60.
I don't have to answer to this shit.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.326
Fine. Don't.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.686
Yeah, she must be a pig.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.251
Definitely.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.722
- You're amazing.
- You're doing all the work.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.962
You're doing plenty. Oh.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.801
Oh, my God. This could be it.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.406
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.848
- Hello?
- Please tell me you're not still sleeping.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.647
I've already run five miles
and fucked like an adult film star.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.201
I'm about to have a baby, asshole.
I thought you were Sloan.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.330
- Speaking of, you were in my dream last night.
- I hope I wasn't naked.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.562
Nope, your baby mama gave birth
to Pete Dinklage.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.842
- You're not related to him, are you?
- Who is that?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.207
- You got a girl there, E?
- What do you want, Ari?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.486
Big titties? Tight ass?

13:10.680 --> 13:14.651
- Give me something I can use in the office.
- I can hear you. You're disgusting.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.882
- And I have both.
- How do you do it, E?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.281
I know it's not your looks
or your personality.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.130
- Ari.
- Just one pic.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.687
Come on. My wife didn't really fuck me
this morning.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.330
- She gets headaches.
- Ari!

13:25.480 --> 13:26.845
- Hey, Thierry.
- Hey.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.287
- You gonna coach my son's team?
- I don't have time for that shit.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.646
I love the honesty.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.926
E!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.645
When am I gonna see this movie?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.565
- I was gonna call you to talk about it.
- I don't wanna talk.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.085
I want to watch a film.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.890
- It's not ready.
- When will it be?

13:40.040 --> 13:42.361
Because important people
are starting to wonder.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.249
Important people meaning me.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.007
Did I tell you The Jewish Journal named me
"Best-Looking Circumcised Studio Head"?

13:48.160 --> 13:52.051
- Well, Vince still hasn't finished his cut.
- You've been saying that for a month.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.282
- Hold on.
- Do you have time for lunch today?

13:55.440 --> 13:58.091
- No, I can't. I got the doctor.
- Oh.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.890
That's right. With Sloan.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.530
Look, I know this is weird...

14:01.680 --> 14:03.808
- Eric!
- Yeah, uh, listen...

14:03.960 --> 14:07.169
- ...how about Vince and I come and see you?
- See me? Why?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.600
- Something wrong?
- No, it's all good.

14:08.760 --> 14:12.321
- We're just gonna come by the office. You free?
- For what? What's wrong?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.528
Uh, we need more money. Bye.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.930
Don't hang... Did you hang up on me?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.441
E, you fucking dwarf cunt!

14:19.600 --> 14:20.806
What's a dwarf cunt, Dad?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.490
I'm sorry. It's nothing, buddy.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.405
It's a new movie idea I had.
Don't use that word at school.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.562
You were just on a run.
How could you be so angry?

14:27.760 --> 14:30.411
Work is not supposed to make you
this angry anymore, Ari.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.449
- Yeah, Dad.
- I know. I know.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.927
- That was our agreement.
- Yes. I know.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.889
Do we need to make a therapy session
with Dr. Marcus?

14:37.040 --> 14:39.441
- No.
- I think that would be best.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.486
Maybe.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.888
Why are you so scared
to show Ari the movie?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.121
I'm not scared.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.846
- Should at least show him my scenes.
- It's not ready yet...

14:49.000 --> 14:51.685
which is why I need E to tell him
that he can't see it until after the screening.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.446
You really won't tell him?
I told him about the money.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.729
- The only thing he'll do is scream at me.
- Oh, fine. I'll tell him.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.087
- Pussy.
- Speaking of which...

15:00.240 --> 15:03.642
- Wait till you see the girls I got lined up tonight.
- I told you I was handling the girls.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.885
I know. But I would like to avoid some of
the nursing home rejects from the last party.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.522
I thought the screening was to get opinions
on the movie, not to get laid.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.485
Everything we do is to also get laid, E.
You know that.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.091
Fuck me.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.890
- Emily Ratajkowski.
- I love her.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.485
- I know her.
- Why wouldn't you?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.483
- Hey, Vince.
- Hey, Emily. How are you?

15:21.640 --> 15:24.644
It's so funny to see you. I just got
an invitation for your screening.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.881
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.246
One of mine, obviously.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.011
Whose-ever. This is gonna be
a great fucking screening.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.646
Vince.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.085
Uh, hey, Emily, I gotta run
into this meeting. I'll call you later?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.129
Yeah. Call me.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.404
- You're upset.
- "Upset"?

15:51.560 --> 15:52.925
He means angry.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.924
This is the third time
that you've come to me for more money.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.809
- Ari, listen...
- I was talking to Vince, Eric.

15:57.960 --> 16:01.521
I know they didn't teach you about budgets
in spaghetti and meatballs class.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.490
Vinnie has been on sets before,
so I expected more from him.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.450
- Told you he'd yell at me.
- Yeah, but he's yelling about me.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.366
What'd you spend the money on? I know
it wasn't on Turtle and Craft Services.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.569
- Like the new svelte frame?
- You look like Karen fucking Carpenter.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.360
What did I tell you
when I gave you $100 million?

16:18.520 --> 16:19.567
What'd we tell you?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.200
- You agreed to not go over.
- We told you it wasn't enough.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.283
But you agreed to not go over.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.886
Because you said I couldn't direct
unless we agreed.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.884
It's like when a girl asks
if you wanna bang her hot sister.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.201
Of course you say no.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.170
Neither of you really believes
you mean it, though.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.802
- What's he doing here? This is bad.
- When you see it, you won't think so.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.088
- He's seen it?
- He's seen a couple of scenes.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.289
- They are powerful.
- Yeah, a few in particular.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.606
When am I gonna see it?

16:44.760 --> 16:46.171
We're having
a friends-and-family screening tonight.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.243
We'll get some feedback,
then show you the cut.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.681
You're gonna let everyone see it but me.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.330
Ari, you are all that matters.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.166
- I want it to be perfect when I show it to you.
- I can't just write you a check.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.164
I gotta deal with these
co-financiers in Texas.

16:59.320 --> 17:03.166
Do you know how hard I have worked
to avoid going to Texas?

17:03.320 --> 17:06.847
- You know what they do to Jews in Texas?
- I didn't take an acting fee...

17:07.040 --> 17:08.929
which you know is more than
the 10 million over budget we are.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.161
You're 15 over.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.090
Really?

17:13.119 --> 17:16.089
Okay, well, I didn't take the fee
because I wanted to direct.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.810
We've known each other for 15 years,
you gotta trust me.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.328
I didn't waste one single nickel. I've been
killing myself to make this movie great...

17:22.480 --> 17:24.767
and I won't stop working
until it is perfect.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.922
I need the money to make it perfect.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.766
So can you get it for me?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.486
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.326
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, you're not late. You're on time, as always.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.482
- How you feeling?
- Big.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.161
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.808
Did you get my e-mail
about my cousin Sean? He had his baby.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.082
- No, what did he have?
- A girl. Laurie.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.242
- Oh...
- I sent you a picture.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.246
I think your e-mails
are going to my spam.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.084
It's not intentional.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.447
Look. There she is.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.804
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.689
Look at those eyes.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.606
Someone named Melanie wants your cock.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.162
- Huh?
- Yeah, it just came up on the screen.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.931
"I want your cock." From Melanie.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.929
- Wow, that's, uh...
- Classy.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.121
Sorry. It's not my business.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.805
- Sloan?
- Coming.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.327
Okay, let me help you up.
I will be right here.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.687
- Thanks. Okay. And I'll be in there.
- Okay.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.525
- This is some bullshit.
- Hey, Tip. How you doing, man?

18:32.680 --> 18:36.241
Man, if I'm gonna have more kids
than albums, I'm doing just damn fine.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.728
- You need to shut the fuck up.
- Don't tell me to shut the fuck up.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.769
- Shut your ovaries up.
- So it's my fault.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.490
I'm gonna take this. I'll be right back.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.162
Yeah, man. Call somebody who can kick me
in my nuts. I need a vasectomy.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.401
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.251
- Bad time?
- No, but you can't text me shit like that.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.566
Shit like what?

18:51.720 --> 18:54.166
- You beg me to text you sexy stuff all day.
- I know.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.010
- But Sloan was looking at my phone.
- Oh.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.401
I didn't realize you were
at the doctor's already.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.927
- Why's she looking at your phone?
- I was showing her a picture...

19:01.080 --> 19:02.605
- ...of my cousin's baby.
- Great.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.525
- Yeah, she must really think I'm a whore.
- No, she doesn't.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.286
God, I only sent that
because I was feeling insecure.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.442
I didn't think anyone was gonna see it.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.761
I know. I'm sorry.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.042
This is really weird, Eric.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.727
- You were right. This is too weird.
- Could we talk about this at the screening?

19:17.920 --> 19:20.651
No, Eric.
I really don't wanna get in any deeper.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.844
I think you're a great guy. I really do.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.923
And I promise I'm not mad.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.208
Just respect me, please.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.010
Don't call.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.201
All we're saying is we don't get why
you fall in love with every girl you fuck.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.731
And all I'm saying is that,
unlike you...

19:39.880 --> 19:43.282
I like to have more of a connection
than whether I have exact change.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.046
Please. I haven't paid
for pussy in years.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.801
At least a year.

19:47.960 --> 19:52.204
The point is she said not to call her anymore.
So respect that and see if she calls you.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.761
But hope she doesn't.
You got enough complications now.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.246
Right. How's Sloan anyway?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.528
Doctor says she's gonna pop any second.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.765
- One vagina closes just as another opens.
- You're disgusting.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.127
Yeah, and you're a mope, E,
which we can't have.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.931
This is a big night for Vince,
so try not to ruin it.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.084
- Don't worry. His moping has never affected me.
- I'm not moping.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.608
You're moping, E. You need to get on top
of something fast so you stop.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.411
I had sex less than six hours ago.
I think I'll be okay.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.565
You're fucking something tonight.
For baby bro, if not for yourself.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.961
- Holy shit.
- What?

20:24.120 --> 20:25.531
Ronda Rousey, the fighter.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.808
- So what?
- So I love her. Get in the car.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.729
Get in the car!

20:37.160 --> 20:38.605
- Jesus, Turtle!
- Sorry!

20:38.760 --> 20:40.171
Do you even know her?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.527
We met at Coachella a few years ago,
remember?

20:42.680 --> 20:44.170
- Think we had a connection.
- Please.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.561
- He's got a better chance of fucking me.
- Or me.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.361
- Should I abandon this?
- Do you really think you had a connection?

20:50.160 --> 20:51.571
- Yeah.
- Then go.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.165
You're good peoples, Vin.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.087
Yo! Stop following me, motherfucker!

21:15.240 --> 21:19.131
No! No! We know each other! I just wanted
to invite you to my boy's screening.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.649
- Oh. Hey, Vince.
- Hi.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.810
- Uh, sorry about your car.
- It's all good.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.165
- Do you remember me?
- Oh, yeah.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.482
But didn't you used to be really fat?

21:50.880 --> 21:52.769
Lloyd. How many times have I told you...

21:52.920 --> 21:55.844
- ... I don't video chat with men?
- You know how comforting your face is to me.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.770
- What do you need?
- I was wondering...

21:57.960 --> 22:00.964
- ...if I would see you at Vince's screening.
- You were invited?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.010
Drama wants me to see his scenes.
You weren't?

22:04.160 --> 22:06.811
I'm in Texas. Smell the cow shit?

22:06.960 --> 22:09.964
Oh, that's too bad. I actually
wanted to see you face-to-face.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.090
- We are face-to-face, Yoko.
- In three dimensions.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.971
- Why?
- Uh, no, it's nothing.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.807
- Could we have lunch this week?
- I don't typically have lunch...

22:18.960 --> 22:21.406
with my ex-assistants.
Unless I need something...

22:21.560 --> 22:24.211
which I can't imagine
being the case, so, what's up?

22:24.400 --> 22:27.085
- I'm getting married!
- Oh, God.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.645
And I want you to give me away.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.723
- Oh, God!
- Please don't make a gay joke.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.486
I wasn't going to. I was
gonna make a marriage joke.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.961
Now that you've been granted those rights,
good luck with the divorce.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.322
That'll really make you wish
for a good ole ass fucking.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.648
- Ari.
- Heh-heh.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.206
- I gotta go.
- Wait!

22:45.360 --> 22:47.966
- Ari! Will you give me away?
- Bye.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.081
Hey, Larsen.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.287
Say, Ari.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.569
This is my son, Travis. He's gonna
sit in with us, if you don't mind.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.331
Good.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.207
Ari, we sure do appreciate you
coming out here.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.970
Oh, of course.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.966
You've been on the job nearly eight months,
and you hadn't paid us a visit yet.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.128
- We're beginning to feel unloved.
- Heh-heh.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.725
I didn't know I was invited.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.850
Anybody who spends my money
like you do...

23:20.040 --> 23:23.567
always invited to my home
to tell me why.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.087
Saw you on Piers Morgan last night.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.446
Oh, yeah?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.681
What'd you think?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.211
I thought you looked nervous.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.284
Well, I wasn't.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.046
Travis, here, got a real good eye
for things like that.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.965
And he said you looked like
one of them guys that, uh...

23:40.120 --> 23:41.565
What was it you said again?

23:41.720 --> 23:45.520
Like one of those guys from big tobacco
when they were up there lying to Congress.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.091
Ah. Heh-heh-heh.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.561
Well, my wife thought I looked sexy.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.087
Ari, am I gonna lose a shit ton of money
on this movie?

23:52.280 --> 23:53.964
No. Your money's in great hands.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.322
- But you still want more.
- Just a little bit.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.529
- For some visual effects it needs.
- I don't care about visual effects.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.809
Well, if you wanna protect
your investment, you need to care.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.240
Hm.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.840
You know, in the last four years...

24:09.600 --> 24:12.729
I've invested nearly a billion dollars
in your studio's movies.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.286
You know how many I've seen?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.090
- Mm-mm.
- Not a goddamn one.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.641
- Hm.
- But this one, I gotta tell you...

24:18.800 --> 24:21.531
with your movie star guy in charge,
I'm damn curious.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.841
I understand.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.651
Ari, we need to see this
before I write another check.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.041
- Larsen, my director...
- Your movie star?

24:29.640 --> 24:33.247
Vince doesn't wanna show the movie
till it's perfect.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.722
- He's an artist. I'd like to respect that.
- Okay...

24:37.720 --> 24:40.690
You know,
my wife has a $12,000 Chihuahua.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.047
Three years running,
it got "Best in Show."

24:43.200 --> 24:47.410
The last judge said that he had
the best cock and balls he'd ever seen.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.366
But he ain't perfect.
You know how I know that?

24:51.520 --> 24:53.488
He keeps pissing on my boots.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.367
I don't follow.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.962
I mean there's no such thing as perfect.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.124
Now, see, for you,
I know this movie's enormous.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.204
If it fails, you go down in flames
quicker than the Hindenberg.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.442
To me, this is just another check.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.090
It won't fail.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.323
I have to go to Dubai tonight
on, uh, more pressing business.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.131
I want you to take Travis here
to La-La Land with you...

25:15.320 --> 25:17.607
and show him the goddamn movie.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.088
- It's not ready.
- Well, get it ready.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.130
Because this oil spigot
is shut off till you do.

25:29.320 --> 25:33.086
- You seriously asking if I'm taking PEDs?
- Yeah, I'm not saying I'm against it.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.926
I just wanna know if you do, because
I wanna get shredded for the Hyde junket.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.447
- No PEDs. I'm all natural.
- Prove it.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.130
- How?
- Take a piss test.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.282
Fine, but if I pass, you drink it.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.205
Guys. Did you know Emily
was seeing Armie Hammer?

25:46.360 --> 25:47.964
- The Lone Ranger?
- I thought they broke up.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.201
Guess they still talk.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.609
I played softball with him.
He's out of his mind. I'd leave it alone.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.728
- Really? I'm gonna try to.
- Yeah.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.042
Why is there enough food here for 300?

25:57.240 --> 25:59.083
There's supposed to be enough for 500.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.009
- Five hundred?
- And Ronda.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.370
Vince, this was supposed to be an intimate
thing so we could get some feedback.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.444
Relax. Turtle thought we'd do better
with a big crowd.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.809
Don't worry. I got everyone walking through that
door signing an NDA, so they can't talk about it.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.241
And where you gonna sit 500 people?
On the couch?

26:14.400 --> 26:17.006
Don't be ridiculous.
There's a whole beach out there.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.685
Check it out.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.530
Jesus.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.725
It's Ari.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.804
- Hello?
- When exactly is this screening of yours?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.086
When it gets dark. Why?

26:34.240 --> 26:37.926
Because I'm coming with your money,
and there ain't nothing we can do about it.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.688
- What's up, Sai?
- Amazing rapper right here.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.166
How are you?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.240
I don't ride a bike.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.607
- I do the Santa Monica steps.
- Sick, bro. Sick.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.167
Throw it, Russ!

27:15.440 --> 27:16.965
The story of Jekyll and Hyde...

27:17.120 --> 27:20.044
represents a concept
in Victorian culture...

27:20.240 --> 27:24.245
of the inner conflict of humanity's sense
of good and evil.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.368
I have no understanding
of what you're saying.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.729
Of course I remember you.
You went to middle school with my daughter.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.530
We always thought you were so funny.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.728
And so cute.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.242
- Let's go.
- Aah!

27:38.400 --> 27:39.561
You tired yet, Turtle?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.562
- Hey, Vince. Buddy. I need a favor.
- Yeah.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.843
I need you to fuck my daughter's friends
so I don't have to.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.288
In English literature, there's a guy
named Jekyll and a guy named Hyde.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.130
And you have that same thing in you.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.123
Do you understand?

27:56.280 --> 27:58.647
I'll show you some of my footage.
You'll flip out.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.768
You even might wanna put me
in Iron Man 3.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.446
- Sure. Well, 4 would be next.
- Iron Man 4.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.365
Downey's great. I love Downey.
He's just a little long in the tooth.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.888
- I think you wanna go younger.
- If I recall, you're five years older.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.044
- You know, fuck you, Favreau.
- What?

28:12.360 --> 28:14.761
You fucked me on Swingers.
You're always fucking me.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.611
I offered you Swingers. You couldn't do it
because of Viking Quest.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.171
You could've shot around me!

28:19.320 --> 28:21.721
Just because you're short, doesn't mean
you can't achieve your goals, E.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.406
- I know that.
- You think I'd have a Super Bowl ring...

28:24.560 --> 28:26.449
if I listened to everybody
who told me I was too short?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.285
Right.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.091
We're thinking of honeymooning
in Moscow or the Ukraine.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.730
We know it's not traditional.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.291
Traditional? Fuck traditional.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.404
- Don't they shoot guys like you over there?
- That's Uganda.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.403
Go to Hawaii. Do yourselves a favor.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.924
Molly. Anyone want molly? Molly.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.491
Molly. Anyone want molly?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.722
I thought you don't do
drugs anymore, Billy.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.327
- I don't do angry drugs anymore, Drama.
- Give me two.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.687
I'm sure Ari has seen
an unfinished film before.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.001
Not one I've directed.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.924
You're really nervous, huh?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.161
It's cute.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.766
- You never get nervous before a photo shoot?
- No, I know what I look like.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.282
Everyone, make sure you fill out
a non-disclosure agreement...

29:03.440 --> 29:05.363
or you cannot stay for the screening.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.966
E, this house is sick.
When did Vince buy it?

29:08.120 --> 29:09.690
It's not Vince's. It's Turtle's.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.320
You're kidding.
How much this fucking guy make?

29:12.520 --> 29:15.285
Excuse me, miss. You can't use a pencil
to fill out the NDA.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.606
So that's a true story?

29:16.760 --> 29:19.127
You beat up four guys
for getting loud at a movie?

29:19.280 --> 29:23.001
Well, the press exaggerated. I just broke
one guy's jaw and another guy's nose.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.208
The third guy...
There wasn't really four.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.966
The third guy, I threw over my shoulder,
and he ran off.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.447
Like a boyfriend with you?
And what'd he do?

29:30.600 --> 29:32.887
No, I haven't had a boyfriend
in like two years.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.366
- Too focused on my career.
- Oh.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.569
You're in four fucking scenes and
you expect me to get you a magazine cover?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.485
Scarlett Jo wasn't even on camera in Her.
She got a cover.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.688
If you had her tits,
I can get you a cover.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.882
I got a couple covers coming out, Drama.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.883
Even a few I turned down.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.849
What the fuck you making over here?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.809
Little potion for E.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.009
Molly, water and a touch of Viagra.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.961
What did I do wrong with my life?
This is a normal Tuesday afternoon?

29:58.120 --> 29:59.849
You gotta see our Wednesday parties.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.240
Ari, you got invited.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.363
- I want you to meet my fiancé Greg.
- No, Lloyd. No.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.171
- Eric Murphy. Travis McCredle.
- Nice to meet you, Travis.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.725
- Eric manages Vinnie.
- Oh.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.281
And Travis's father co-finances
our entire slate.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.568
All that money's gonna
be mine someday...

30:12.720 --> 30:16.327
so I prefer you consider
that I co-financed the slate.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.201
Fuck me.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.808
Is that Emily Ratajkowski over there
talking to Vinnie Chase?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.287
- Sure is.
- You wanna meet her?

30:23.440 --> 30:26.523
Well, I wanna marry her,
but you gotta start somewhere, right?

30:28.040 --> 30:30.327
- Oh, boy.
- E, have some water.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.323
- Why?
- You look parched. Almost sickly.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.289
- Are you serious?
- You're yellow, bro.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.566
Vinnie Chase!

30:35.720 --> 30:38.849
Big fan of your work,
especially Aquaman 2.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.480
Thanks. But I was only
in the first Aquaman.

30:42.160 --> 30:45.562
Well, all those comic book movies
start to blend together after a while.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.165
Except for The Avengers.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.806
All five of those heroes
on screen at one time.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.930
- That was really something, wasn't it?
- Yeah, well...

30:53.120 --> 30:56.727
- Travis, have you met Emily Ratajkowski?
- No, but I feel like we know each other.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.247
I saw your Sports Illustrated spread
on the plane.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.289
That looked cold. Was that cold?

31:01.440 --> 31:02.566
It was.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.370
Well, it was still hot.

31:07.040 --> 31:11.284
Travis, Vinnie would like to thank you for all
the support you've given him on his movie.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.761
- Yes.
- Hundred million plus, with P&A.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.410
I hear you're looking for more.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.001
Uh, just a little.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.766
Well, I'm looking forward
to being able to explain why.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.568
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Let you guys talk?

31:23.720 --> 31:24.960
Okay.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.004
Vince, is that your girl?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.481
- Oh, no. We're just friends.
- Oh.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.484
- So I'm free in the clear to go for that?
- Uh, yeah.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.361
I don't know what I'm asking you for. You don't
own every piece of pussy in this town, do you?

31:57.280 --> 31:58.691
Mr. Suit.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.365
Are you okay?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.086
I feel strange.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.685
Strange how?

32:03.840 --> 32:06.207
My dick gets hard
every time a girl looks at me.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.448
Like, today or always?

32:11.280 --> 32:12.805
You're cute.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.368
I should probably go talk to her.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.761
Seems like the right move, Suit.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.290
You're a good guy, Bill.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.091
Maybe I could finance something
for you to star in.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.686
- Have you seen anything I've done?
- Not in complete.

32:26.880 --> 32:30.566
But I've seen that trailer for that new one
you got coming out maybe 500 times.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.161
Maybe you wanna finance something
for me to star in.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.685
I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.605
Oh, hey. You're an actor too?

32:38.600 --> 32:39.681
Yeah.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.808
- What've you been in?
- Everything.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.691
- Have you seen him in anything?
- Um, I, uh...

32:44.840 --> 32:46.490
I've seen him in Viking Quest.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.802
- Really?
- Yeah, and he's in my movie.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.007
Just four scenes.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.288
Four pivotal scenes. He's amazing.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.051
One of the reasons why I wanted
to make this movie...

32:55.440 --> 32:57.886
is I knew what that role
would do for my big bro.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.202
- It's gonna change his life.
- Thanks, bro.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.601
- Well, I can't wait to see it.
- I can't either.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.728
So, what's up? Are we gonna do this?

33:04.880 --> 33:09.522
- Ari, relax. It won't be dark for at least an hour.
- When everyone's seated, it will be. Let's go.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.411
- All right. I gotta find E.
- Fuck E.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.404
So you're a Viking Quest fan, huh?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.881
- How long have you lived here?
- A couple of months.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.964
It came with all the furniture and stuff,
so it feels lived in.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.565
So, what's your deal, Turtle?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.529
You selling coke these days?

33:27.040 --> 33:29.088
No. Why would you say that?

33:29.240 --> 33:32.961
Because the last time I saw you,
you were a fat pothead living off of Vince.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.327
And now you live next to Spielberg.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.524
I started a tequila company.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.920
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.645
And I started working out.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.325
What do you do, Pilates?

33:44.280 --> 33:47.284
I box a little. And I do cardio.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.601
That's cute.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.967
- What?
- I think someone's fucking in there.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.721
Come on.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.321
Motherfucker!

33:58.480 --> 34:00.084
Oh, my God!

34:00.960 --> 34:02.291
- I got it.
- Fucker.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.686
Hey! Oh, shit!

34:06.520 --> 34:09.409
Of all the guys I never thought
I'd catch fucking in my room.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.925
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.969
I love it. I love it.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.565
Hi, Ronda Rousey.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.529
I won 500 bucks on your last fight.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.284
You said you were a Virgo?

34:26.440 --> 34:28.920
Oh... Um, a Gemini.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.081
The twins, right?

34:31.239 --> 34:33.322
- Yeah. Oh.
- I love twins.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.844
Come on, Vinnie.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.571
Let's roll this motherfucker!

34:37.760 --> 34:41.321
- You ever think about playing basketball?
- You ever thought about signing me?

34:43.760 --> 34:46.922
Guys. Guys. What the fuck are we doing?

34:47.080 --> 34:49.650
Vince doesn't wanna show you
the movie with this crowd.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.770
- Holy shit.
- What?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.967
- How bad is it?
- Ari, it's...

34:54.120 --> 34:56.885
No, you look nervous right now.
I've never seen you nervous.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.122
- Just tell me, does it suck?
- No. It doesn't.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.845
- Tell him it doesn't suck.
- It doesn't suck.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.411
Film!

35:03.600 --> 35:06.171
Film! Film! Film!

35:06.320 --> 35:08.846
Film! Film! Film! Film!

35:09.040 --> 35:14.001
Come on! Fucking film! Roll it, Vinnie!
Come on! Just put it on!

35:15.320 --> 35:17.846
Vinnie, show us the fucking film!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.286
Let's go, baby!

35:19.440 --> 35:27.530
Film! Film! Film!

35:27.680 --> 35:30.604
Hey, I'm gonna take care of it.

35:30.760 --> 35:35.527
Vince? Time to get this show on the road.
I've put in some quality time alone with Emily.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.205
What's the running time on this?

35:37.400 --> 35:38.811
A hundred and forty minutes.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.450
Jesus.

35:40.600 --> 35:44.764
I like short movies, Vince. You know?
And comedies. You ever seen Bad Grandpa?

35:44.920 --> 35:46.160
- I'm calling this off.
- That never gets old.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.560
You know, fuck these guys.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.722
You know what?
Give Travis and Ari DVDs to take home.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.201
- Hold on. Vince...
- I can watch that with Emily.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.326
Hey, everyone.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.369
- Vinnie.
- Good news and bad news.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.804
The bad news is the projector broke.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.930
No! No, no. Vinnie, no!

36:03.080 --> 36:04.366
The good news is...

36:04.520 --> 36:06.329
look who just showed up:

36:06.480 --> 36:09.086
- Pharrell!
- Pharrell? What the fuck is Pharrell?

36:09.240 --> 36:11.925
Could we possibly convince you
to come up here and perform?

36:14.440 --> 36:16.124
I'm gonna kill Vince.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.448
- My life is over.
- No, it isn't, Ari. Relax.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.331
Relax, E? You remember
that Colombian soccer player...

36:28.480 --> 36:31.245
that got strung up by his dick
after giving up the game-winning goal?

36:31.400 --> 36:33.368
That's where we're headed
if this movie tanks.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.411
Vince will not come back from this,
neither will I and neither will you.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.449
Relax knowing that.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.291
I don't ask for much, do I?

36:46.440 --> 36:48.681
Health and happiness for the kids,
peace on Earth...

36:48.840 --> 36:51.844
the wife to have bigger tits,
only sometimes.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.129
- But I'm...
- What are you doing?

36:56.040 --> 36:58.520
- Nothing.
- You didn't come to bed.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.162
- No, I haven't...
- What...?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.449
What, are you praying?

37:03.600 --> 37:05.443
Yeah. Something wrong with that?

37:05.880 --> 37:07.723
Well, you don't believe in God, so...

37:07.880 --> 37:09.405
For the good stuff I do.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.569
It's 2 a.m. You sat down
to watch this movie at midnight.

37:13.720 --> 37:14.846
I'm mentally prepping.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.884
- I'm gonna start now. You wanna join me?
- You said I couldn't.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.691
You could blow me through it
if it sucks. Ease the pain?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.810
Good luck. I'll see you in bed.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.401
I love you.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.050
I love you too.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.367
Don't fuck me on this, Vinnie.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.527
Don't you fuck me.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.891
Sadly, all good parties
must come to an end.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.563
Oh, come on. There is no way Emily
would bang that yokel.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.530
- I'm telling you, she left with him.
- I don't care. No way.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.648
These guys with money
always get women out of their league.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.325
You mean like Turtle and Ronda?

39:16.480 --> 39:20.451
Oh, please. She's more likely to break
his windpipe than bang his malnourished ass.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.647
Huh. We'll see.

39:22.120 --> 39:25.249
We were texting all night.
And she sent me a sexy pic.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.606
- Yeah, right.
- Shut up.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.211
Mm-hm.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.885
That's a fight promo pic.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.849
Not released yet though, bitch.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.210
And she just said, "I'm sending an Uber
for you," in 90 minutes, so both of you.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.727
Professional pics, Uber car...

39:39.880 --> 39:42.565
She wants something from you
and it ain't your dick, bro.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.248
I agree. She probably wants you to make her
some money now that you're Mini-Mark Cuban.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.361
That's fine. Truth is, I'd rather work
with her than date her, anyway.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.363
Oh, you are so full of shit, Turtle.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.603
Or maybe those skinny pills he's taking
are filled with estrogen.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.569
- Yo, yo.
- Good morning, bro.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.200
- Any word from Ari?
- Radio silence.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.442
He probably hasn't even
watched it yet, Vin.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.365
Yeah, maybe his DVD player broke.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.248
Hey, sit down, bro.
I made your favorite:

40:10.400 --> 40:12.050
Hand-rolled croissants...

40:12.200 --> 40:15.329
eggs Benedict with champagne
sherry-infused béarnaise sauce...

40:15.480 --> 40:17.687
and freshly squeezed guava juice.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.921
That's your favorite.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.686
Johnny, this looks great,
but I'm not really hungry.

40:22.360 --> 40:26.046
Hey, come on. Even if Ari hated
the movie, who gives a shit?

40:26.200 --> 40:28.009
He's still a fucking agent at heart.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.766
- Yeah, seriously, bro. Fuck Ari.
- Yeah, fuck him.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.126
Fuck Ari.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.367
Thanks, guys.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.525
It's Ari.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.965
- Think he heard us?
- What'd he say?

40:39.160 --> 40:41.481
- He wants us to go out front.
- Why?

40:45.240 --> 40:47.208
- Wow.
- Holy shit.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.647
- Look at this!
- I guess he didn't hate the movie.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.888
No, actually, he loved it.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.566
"Vinnie, I'm blown away. Blown away.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.320
And, E, you've done good too."

41:04.560 --> 41:06.767
Any mention of me in that note, bro?

41:25.680 --> 41:26.761
All right, here we go!

41:26.960 --> 41:28.086
Oh, yeah, baby!

41:38.400 --> 41:41.244
I really need an answer, Ari.
Time is running out.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.563
Isn't my offering up my house
for the ceremony enough, Lloyd?

41:44.720 --> 41:49.647
No. Even though that is so amazingly generous,
this is so much more important to me.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.211
I need more information.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.528
- Like what?
- Like what will you be wearing?

41:53.680 --> 41:54.966
I know it can't be white...

41:55.120 --> 41:57.771
- ...because you've been banged more times...
- Ari.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.851
Hey, Liam.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.686
Go fuck yourself, Ari.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.161
Forgive and forget, buddy. No?

42:07.560 --> 42:10.404
Hey, Schindler. Leave no Jew behind!

42:10.560 --> 42:12.722
- Ari?!
- Listen, Lloyd, I love you.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.490
But I just can't commit.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.807
Really?

42:30.920 --> 42:33.491
Hey, Ari. Tell me
you're not parking there.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.644
My studio, Ed. Don't force me to revoke
your parking privileges.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.211
Fucking asshole.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.485
Who is insane enough to park
in my spot, Allen?

42:42.640 --> 42:43.687
I do not know.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.931
Tow it. Actually, I'm in a good mood.
Just spit on it.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.770
Oh, that's my car, Ari.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.724
Travis McCredle's here to see you.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.446
- I can see that now.
- Sorry.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.081
- Didn't know where else to put it.
- That's okay.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.801
What's happening? You get a chance to look
at Vinnie Chase's masterpiece?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.730
I did. You got a minute to chat?

43:02.640 --> 43:05.849
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Uh, hold all my calls, Allen.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.480
Okay. But remember you have
couples therapy at 11.

43:08.640 --> 43:11.564
Oh, and, Ari. Ari. Do you still
want me to spit on his car?

43:13.040 --> 43:15.611
Wow, what a space.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.966
Yeah, it's comfy, huh?

43:17.120 --> 43:18.770
You should see my father's office.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.048
I bet your father
has a much nicer office.

43:21.240 --> 43:25.529
No, my father doesn't believe in wasting
money on extravagant office settings.

43:25.680 --> 43:28.081
My father believes in putting money
into product...

43:28.240 --> 43:31.130
whether that's pig's ears
we're selling for dogs to chew...

43:31.280 --> 43:33.760
or methane gas for Middle Easterners
to poison each other with.

43:33.960 --> 43:38.124
Yes. Well, you know what,
I tried your father. Waiting to hear back.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.090
I spoke to him. I told him he didn't need
to call you until after we spoke.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.810
- Oh.
- I, obviously, didn't like the movie...

43:42.960 --> 43:44.485
as much as you did, Ari.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.808
- No?
- No, it's no masterpiece.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.088
- Not from these eyes' perspective.
- Well...

43:49.240 --> 43:52.005
And what type of training
do you have to judge that?

43:52.160 --> 43:54.811
I went to the Austin PA Film Academy
for a semester...

43:54.960 --> 43:57.486
and all my teachers
said I had tremendous taste.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.961
I can see it in your wardrobe.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.484
Look, Ari, I have thoughts
about this movie...

44:04.640 --> 44:07.530
and my father would like for you
to take them seriously.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.160
Thoughts? You have notes?

44:10.320 --> 44:11.890
Whatever you wanna call them.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.801
But most of them revolve around cutting
out Vincent Chase's mutant brother.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.520
- Drama.
- Yeah.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.490
He's an abomination and he's got to go.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.285
The challenge for me was
I was the only human in that scene.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.885
Everyone else was living dead.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.247
So how did that affect
how you played the role?

44:31.400 --> 44:32.526
It didn't.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.561
It couldn't. I had to be real.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.121
If I played in to it,
no way it could be.

44:38.320 --> 44:39.606
That's really interesting.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.966
Yeah.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.524
Now, come on, baby.
Show me a little nip.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.489
- Please?
- You are relentless.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.847
This is like our third session
since last night.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.685
I'm a little stressed
about an audition I got tomorrow.

44:51.840 --> 44:55.287
And your voice, it soothes me.
Take it as a compliment.

44:55.640 --> 44:56.721
Fine.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.765
Unbutton your pants.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.121
Oh, yeah, baby.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.250
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.482
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.960
- Jen!
- Oh!

45:08.120 --> 45:09.406
What the fuck are you doing?

45:09.600 --> 45:12.331
- Randy! You're supposed to be in Chatsworth.
- Who the fuck is this loser?

45:12.520 --> 45:14.488
You don't need to call me a loser, bro.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.450
- Put some clothes on!
- You're not supposed to be here!

45:17.600 --> 45:20.809
I'll find you. You'll pay for this.
I'm gonna hunt you down...

45:20.960 --> 45:24.009
- ...and you're gonna fucking pay for this!
- Johnny, I'm so sorry.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.764
Johnny, wanna drop me at editing?

45:27.920 --> 45:30.605
- Yeah, sure, bro.
- What the fuck are you doing?

45:33.800 --> 45:36.770
- You think I should start a vodka company?
- I think you'd kill it.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.962
- But I don't even drink.
- Really?

45:39.120 --> 45:41.168
Look, I got a ton of ideas.

45:41.320 --> 45:44.961
You should have a fitness app
and, like, your own clothing line.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.766
What, you don't think
my brand's doing fine already?

45:47.920 --> 45:50.651
I think you could always
be doing better, no?

45:50.800 --> 45:53.087
I'm confused.
Is this a business meeting?

45:54.040 --> 45:55.087
Uh...

45:55.240 --> 45:57.288
- Because I didn't know.
- I didn't know either.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.521
Is this a date?

45:59.680 --> 46:01.444
I don't cook for people
who are trying to pitch me.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.851
I thought a nice, normal guy
wanted to hang out for once.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.650
I did. I do.

46:06.800 --> 46:10.566
No one under 250 pounds ever has the balls
to talk to me. Should've known better.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.449
- No, no. It's not like that.
- You should go.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.523
- Just see yourself out, Turtle.
- Look, Ronda, come on.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.001
You should go
before I feel like hitting something.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.165
I'll call you an Uber.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.290
An UberX, actually.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.008
Motherfucking asshole.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.288
Well, what do you mean, he won't release
any more money? Why not?

46:26.440 --> 46:27.521
I'm dealing with it.

46:27.720 --> 46:30.803
- I thought you said his opinion didn't matter.
- It doesn't, and I'm dealing with it.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.691
Well, you better deal fast because
we can't finish the movie without money.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.888
Really? Because I thought
we could finish it with Froot Loops.

46:36.040 --> 46:38.361
You're funny, but did you tell Vince?
Because he's on his way to editing.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.767
I'm telling you because it's your job...

46:40.920 --> 46:43.526
along with going over budget
and being short, to tell him.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.205
You need to call him
because I'm walking into Lamaze class.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.890
Nothing says you're working hard...

46:47.040 --> 46:50.442
more than Lamaze class at noon
on a Wednesday, E. Thanks for nothing.

46:51.080 --> 46:52.491
Hey, baby.

46:53.360 --> 46:56.569
- I'm excited for therapy.
- Don't be. It's a waste of fucking money.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.131
- Hey, Kelsey.
- Ari. Melissa.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.725
- Hi.
- You okay?

46:59.920 --> 47:01.251
I'm here, so I'm fucked.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.688
Since you're here, I'm guessing
you're fucked as well. Nice seeing you.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.650
This should be fun.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.600
Breathe in.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.327
One, two, three.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.281
And continue.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.249
What about the name Ryan?

47:16.400 --> 47:18.289
- For a boy or a girl?
- Either.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.286
I like it.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.404
But Ryan Murphy created Glee.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.723
And you think people
will confuse our baby with him?

47:25.880 --> 47:28.247
If we name our baby Ryan Murphy,
then, yeah, I do.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.522
Why does Chad Lowe keep staring at you?

47:34.840 --> 47:37.207
Hey. How are you?

47:42.360 --> 47:44.886
- Would you stop?
- I just didn't know you were dating.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.441
We went out a couple of times.
It's not a big deal.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.207
- Wonder what the girl he's with thinks about it.
- They're not together.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.771
What are they doing in Lamaze class?

47:52.920 --> 47:55.048
What are we doing in Lamaze class?

47:55.200 --> 47:57.123
- This is a fucked-up town.
- Yeah.

47:58.320 --> 48:01.483
You know, I think we're better off
if we don't question each other.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.450
I agree.
But tell me you haven't had sex.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.409
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

48:06.560 --> 48:08.289
Well, you can't. Can you?

48:08.440 --> 48:11.091
I mean, with the baby in there.
You could hurt it, right?

48:11.280 --> 48:14.090
Relax, Eric. No, I'm not having sex.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.282
And not because I haven't wanted to.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.442
Because, I don't know
if you know this...

48:18.600 --> 48:20.568
but pregnant women can get very horny.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.644
Problem is, nobody wants
to have sex with me.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.564
I'd have sex with you.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.609
Where are you headed with this?

48:29.800 --> 48:32.451
Are you gonna tell me you love me
and want me back again?

48:32.600 --> 48:34.841
Who's talking about love?
I'm talking about sex.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.447
I'm saying that I would have sex with you
right now if you really need it.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.449
I just don't wanna get emotional.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.361
Do you know I haven't even been held
in six months?

48:44.560 --> 48:46.847
I see that you're already
getting emotional.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.851
- Follow me home.
- Seriously?

48:51.000 --> 48:54.049
Yeah, sure. Why not?
You're clean. I trust you.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.765
- Sloan.
- Yeah.

48:56.240 --> 48:59.483
- I'm not really that clean.
- What do you mean?

49:01.240 --> 49:03.561
I had sex with someone last night.

49:03.720 --> 49:06.246
Oh, who? The "I want your cock" texter?

49:07.280 --> 49:08.611
No, someone else.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.491
Actually I had sex with the texter
yesterday also.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.530
- Two girls in 24 hours?
- Well, not by design.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.960
Who are you?

49:16.120 --> 49:20.011
And why do you always
have to be so fucking honest?

49:20.160 --> 49:21.321
That's just who I am.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.761
- And I guess that's why we're not together.
- No.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.447
We're not together because you fucked
my stepmother. Don't ever forget that.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.762
And you told me that if I came clean
and admitted it, you'd get over it.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.001
So don't forget that.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.400
I tried, Eric.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.929
I mean, I didn't move to New York
because I really wanted to try. I did.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.041
I'll talk to you later.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.323
- Hello.
- It's Melanie.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.289
I need you to meet me
at the Little Door in 30.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.966
- I didn't think I'd hear from you.
- Eric, this isn't a social call.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.407
I'm pregnant.
And if you don't meet me in 30...

49:55.560 --> 49:57.961
the next call you'll get
is from my attorney.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.160
Eric.

50:04.320 --> 50:06.721
I can't believe I'm gonna say this...

50:06.880 --> 50:08.405
but I'm willing to try again.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.131
Did you hear what I said?

50:15.120 --> 50:16.167
Uh...

50:17.680 --> 50:19.728
Okay. Good talk.

50:23.320 --> 50:27.291
So why did you stop taking
the "anger meds," as you call them?

50:27.440 --> 50:29.522
- I didn't think they were working.
- I did.

50:29.680 --> 50:33.890
Except to affect me in places
that I just didn't want to be affected.

50:34.040 --> 50:37.840
- Have you been unable to maintain an erection?
- I didn't say that. Did I say that?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.209
- He's having trouble finishing.
- Meaning that I can go all night.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.407
Boom.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.963
And now you feel that he's reverting back
to his past behaviors.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.363
It's as if we're in a time machine.

50:49.560 --> 50:52.086
The past behaviors
that almost ended your marriage.

50:52.240 --> 50:53.321
Yes.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.524
You don't feel that is true, Ari?

50:55.680 --> 50:58.604
No, of course I don't feel
that it's true, because it's not.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.368
I promised my wife
that if she let me go back to work...

51:01.520 --> 51:05.525
it would be nothing but fun, and it has
been. I do almost nothing but smile all day.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.726
And the anger meds didn't make me calm.
They just made me not able to come...

51:09.920 --> 51:12.651
which just made me angry
and just made my wife sore.

51:12.800 --> 51:16.247
Now, currently,
I am a little bit stressed...

51:16.400 --> 51:19.768
about this giant movie, because I
haven't been able to see it until yesterday.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.445
Thank God, it's fucking amazing.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.325
Suddenly this little punk bitch version
of Forrest Gump...

51:24.480 --> 51:27.768
thinks he has the authority to weigh in on
cutting my movie star director's brother...

51:27.920 --> 51:31.686
and his fucking Foghorn Leghorn of a father
won't call me back to tell me that he doesn't.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.482
So, yes, I am a tiny, tiny bit stressed,
which is normal, no?

51:37.680 --> 51:40.251
Why don't we keep the focus off work?

51:41.280 --> 51:44.329
- Tell her what you did today.
- What does that have to do with anything?

51:44.480 --> 51:47.165
He told his ex-assistant that he could
have his wedding at our house.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.800
- "Ex-assistant." He's like a daughter to me.
- You didn't even ask me.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.243
- I thought you'd like it.
- 300 gay men running around in our yard?

51:53.400 --> 51:55.448
You're making bigoted
assumptions now, baby.

51:55.600 --> 52:00.242
He said it was it'd be a toga-themed wedding
with glass dildos as centerpieces.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.323
That was a joke, obviously.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.643
He has these highs and lows.

52:04.800 --> 52:09.283
Like, one minute he's on the phone, screaming,
and the next he's on the ground, praying.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.728
And I have this feeling in my gut
that he could explode at any second.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.927
It's just not true.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.760
- I told you to turn that off.
- I thought I did. Ahem.

52:17.920 --> 52:20.161
It could be the Texan or Vince...

52:20.360 --> 52:21.691
It's the studio.

52:23.920 --> 52:26.321
It's a new phone.
I don't how to turn the ringer off.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.608
- Turn the whole power off.
- Well, I don't know how to.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.240
Well, it's the studio again.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.607
- Don't answer that.
- Well, it must be important.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.683
- Don't.
- It could be about the Texan or Vince.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.325
I have to take it. I...

52:39.200 --> 52:41.168
- What?
- Did you show a cut...

52:41.320 --> 52:43.891
of Vince's movie
to Larsen McCredle's son?

52:44.040 --> 52:45.405
Yes. How do you know?

52:45.560 --> 52:47.369
The editor just called.

52:47.520 --> 52:49.966
- Apparently the kid showed up with notes.
- Jesus.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.610
- Is Vince there?
- Not yet.

52:51.760 --> 52:53.808
But the kid said, and I'm quoting:

52:53.960 --> 52:56.201
"That pretty boy director
is locked out...

52:56.400 --> 52:58.767
along with everyone else,
until I say so."

52:59.080 --> 53:01.082
Aargh!

53:05.280 --> 53:06.520
Ari?

53:06.680 --> 53:08.444
- Ari?
- I gotta go, Dana.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.962
I'm okay to continue.

53:18.280 --> 53:20.726
Look, maybe she did
wanna bang you. My bad.

53:20.920 --> 53:25.562
- Yeah. Your bad. You totally got in my head.
- Why don't you just call her and apologize?

53:25.760 --> 53:28.843
I already did. She sent me
straight to voicemail. Twice.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.729
Look, Turtle, I'm sorry.

53:30.880 --> 53:35.124
- But I got my own problems right now.
- Don't fuck girls with boyfriends, you wouldn't.

53:35.280 --> 53:38.523
- She never mentioned she had a boyfriend.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.808
Unless she sells you out,
how's he gonna find you anyway?

53:40.960 --> 53:42.371
Well, maybe he recognized me.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.091
What are the odds of that?
A billion to one at least.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.806
- Could you please not make fun of me?
- Ever?

53:49.600 --> 53:51.284
All right, what's the problem?

53:52.840 --> 53:55.081
You know what I'm auditioning
for tomorrow?

53:55.240 --> 53:57.641
Victim Number Three on The Mentalist.

53:57.800 --> 54:01.566
- An old, broken-down male ballerina.
- Good part?

54:03.560 --> 54:07.246
You know, I know people have looked
at me as a joke for the past 20 years.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.689
But in Vince's movie...

54:09.840 --> 54:11.410
it felt like I found something.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.282
And I'm just praying
that people see it...

54:14.440 --> 54:16.647
and that things really change for me.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.088
I got a good feeling that they will.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.486
Thanks.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.763
- Hey, is that E?
- No.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.241
- Maybe.
- That is E.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.647
Hang on.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.167
Yo, E!

54:40.200 --> 54:42.168
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.163
Where's your car?

54:44.320 --> 54:46.322
Nobody walks in L.A., E.
You look stupid.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.167
My life is over.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.964
Come on, Travis. Open the door.

54:54.120 --> 54:57.329
- I'm dealing with Ari on this, Vince.
- On what? Come on!

54:58.080 --> 55:00.401
- Just open the door!
- Yo, Vinnie, what's up?

55:00.560 --> 55:03.211
- Yo, what's up, Mark?
- I'm doing some looping for Ted 3.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.767
- 3? How many of those are you gonna do?
- Shit, I'll do 20 if I can.

55:05.920 --> 55:08.002
What's the matter? Your girlfriend
lock you out of the editing room?

55:08.160 --> 55:09.889
No, my co-financier.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.646
You serious? My boys will break down
the fucking door right now.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.484
- I got the Hamster here. He's crazy.
- I'm crazy.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.441
- Vinnie.
- What's up, Ari?

55:16.600 --> 55:19.683
- What kind of shit studio you running here?
- Mark, hey. Calm down.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.047
Dude, I'm calm.
But you better get excited.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.123
You don't want everybody around town thinking
that this is how you treat your filmmakers.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.886
- What the fuck is going on?
- I am dealing with it.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.963
E said he won't release any more money.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.167
- Can he do that?
- Ari.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.961
He's got issues.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.282
- He doesn't like the movie?
- It doesn't matter.

55:34.680 --> 55:35.920
Tell him the truth.

55:36.080 --> 55:39.482
- Yeah, seriously. Ari, come on, speak!
- Tell him the truth. Don't be shy.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.690
He doesn't like Drama.
He wants to cut him out.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.570
- Johnny?
- That's fucked up, Vince.

55:46.720 --> 55:50.805
I'm doing my show Wahlburgers at A&E.
If they try to cut my mother, I'd kill somebody.

55:50.960 --> 55:53.042
Even if she sucked as bad
as Drama probably sucks.

55:53.240 --> 55:56.164
You guys know Reggie from Jordan, right?
You want some shoes?

55:56.320 --> 55:58.163
- No, no, we're good, Mark.
- Gotcha.

55:58.320 --> 56:01.164
- I'm not cutting out Johnny.
- No, you're not.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.810
I will take care of it.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.047
You better.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.009
Oh, shit. That's Ari Gold.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.803
Have the redneck country-ass hick
in editing bay three dragged off my lot.

56:16.960 --> 56:21.204
If he resists, you have my permission
to shoot him in the fucking head!

56:24.600 --> 56:26.284
You're like an NBA player, E.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.528
Imagine when someone says,
"You have twins?"

56:28.680 --> 56:32.321
He says, "No, they're not twins.
One was born in October, one in April."

56:32.480 --> 56:35.131
- Like miniature Irish twins.
- You guys are funny...

56:35.280 --> 56:38.648
- ...but what do I do?
- Take a breath. You don't even know it's yours.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.326
- Yeah, or if she wants it.
- Well, she wants something.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.246
- You guys don't have to wait.
- We know. We will anyway.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.004
He's a fucking idiot.
Who cares what he thinks?

56:58.160 --> 57:01.448
Someone, apparently, because
they're letting him hold my film hostage.

57:01.640 --> 57:04.120
- Not to pile on...
- What?

57:04.280 --> 57:08.126
Well, my publicist called and said that
Just Jared wants to know if we're dating.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.524
I don't care. Up to you. Tell them
whatever you're comfortable with.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.444
That wasn't their only question.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.840
- No?
- No.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.731
They wanted to confirm that there's
something wrong with the movie...

57:17.880 --> 57:20.247
- ...since you canceled the screening.
- Oh, Jesus.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.801
- What did you tell them?
- That it was great.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.129
Do you really think it's great?

57:27.720 --> 57:28.960
Yes.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.331
Now, stop.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.369
You're too good-looking to be insecure.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.090
I'm gonna call E.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.805
- Ha.
- Fuck you doing?

57:46.120 --> 57:47.167
We're hungry.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.005
Eric.

57:52.680 --> 57:54.091
Hey.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.441
- Paula.
- Yeah, of course.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.206
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. Funny running into you here.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.931
I wanted to talk to you,
but we didn't exchange numbers.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.326
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

58:02.480 --> 58:06.405
- Do you mind if I sit for a minute?
- You know, actually, I have a meeting right now.

58:06.560 --> 58:09.609
- Is there any way I can call you later?
- We had sex last night...

58:09.760 --> 58:11.922
- ...so I'm gonna sit for one minute.
- Okay.

58:12.080 --> 58:14.970
- Isn't that the girl he banged last night?
- I think so.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.044
- She the one that got pregnant?
- I can't keep up with this guy.

58:18.200 --> 58:21.329
I just wanted to say that
that was really fast for me.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.164
I don't usually do that that fast.

58:23.320 --> 58:24.367
Me either.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.289
It was something about you.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.007
Like, you just seemed
so sweet and innocent.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.881
Is that an act?

58:32.240 --> 58:34.368
- No.
- Really?

58:35.960 --> 58:37.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.724
- Is that the other one?
- I don't know. I guess.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.286
This could get ugly.

58:42.440 --> 58:44.204
- Should we do something?
- Yeah.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.806
- Take pictures.
- What, did you bring a date?

58:47.000 --> 58:50.163
No, no, no. We just ran into each other.
I just met him last night.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.924
- Oh.
- Is this your girlfriend?

58:52.080 --> 58:54.367
- Uh...
- Last night you said you didn't have one.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.329
I don't. I don't have a girlfriend.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.403
No, no, no. I'm not his girlfriend.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.846
Excuse me.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.811
Although, we did have sex...

59:01.960 --> 59:03.769
uh, yesterday.

59:05.120 --> 59:06.690
Are you serious? So did we.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.691
- Did he get you pregnant also?
- Not that I know of.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.049
You better check because, apparently,
he has very strong swimmers.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.682
Okay, um, I will go to the gyno today.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.450
What time did you guys have sex?

59:19.600 --> 59:21.045
Like 6 a.m. Why?

59:21.240 --> 59:22.526
Okay, so you're fine.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.968
The reason why
I wanted to talk to you today...

59:26.160 --> 59:28.401
This is, like, embarrassing. Um...

59:28.560 --> 59:30.801
- You might need to go to the doctor too.
- What?

59:31.000 --> 59:32.923
I really don't wanna talk about this
in front of her.

59:33.080 --> 59:35.082
- Talk about what?
- Ugh.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.644
Okay, I might have something.
It's probably not contagious.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.888
- Ew.
- Don't get nasty with me, bitch.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.850
- What do you have, like herpes or something?
- Can you shut the fuck up?

59:44.000 --> 59:47.322
Shh. Girls, I don't know what to say
to you at the same time...

59:47.520 --> 59:50.888
Why don't you say you're sorry
for being another typical L.A. douchebag?

59:51.040 --> 59:53.281
- Because I'm not.
- Well, we think you are.

59:53.480 --> 59:55.608
Who runs around and uses
as many girls as he can.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.524
- I don't.
- Well, we think you do.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.083
- "We"?
- We used to live together, Eric.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.886
We haven't spoke in a little,
but we did this morning...

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.610
and somehow your name came up.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.761
- So you're not really pregnant.
- No.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.201
- And you don't have herpes.
- No.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.601
Thank God!

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.250
This was pointless.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.368
No. This isn't pointless.
I get the point.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.569
Thank you. Well, not thank you,
but, I mean, I'm sorry.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.000
What the fuck?

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.129
It's still too bleak.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.726
Yes, this movie will be
an Oscar contender...

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.245
but it also has
commercial appeal as well.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.689
The poster needs
to let toothless guys in Texas...

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.320
who snort meth
and possibly fuck their sisters...

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.051
know that it's also fun
for a Saturday night.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.083
If only we could see it, Ari.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.931
DVDs are being made as we speak.
Everyone can see it now.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.770
- You've seen it?
- Oh, yes.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.365
- And it works?
- It works, Dana.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.761
I saw it last night. Ha-ha-ha.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.440
It works so well, in fact, that tonight,
after everyone goes home...

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.685
I might sneak onto the set, go into the Hyde
laboratory and masturbate into a beaker.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.842
Ari. John Ellis keeps calling.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.248
- The chairman of the studio?
- I know who he is.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.481
He's on the lot.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.603
- John Ellis is on the lot?
- Yeah.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.807
What'd he say?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.011
He said to tell you
to get your ass up to his office. Now.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.130
What should I, uh, tell him?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.127
You tell him to get his ass
down to my office.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.005
Now!

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.323
Ari. Ari!

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.130
He said what?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.650
Motherfucker.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.051
Ari. Hey, buddy.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.727
- Dude, what's this May 4th release date?
- I don't have any time for this.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.201
- Come on, dude. Are you serious?
- I'll talk to Marketing. We'll get on it.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.921
We're up against Tyler Perry, the new
Hunger Games. We'll get slaughtered.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.082
You know what, I don't know you.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.440
Hey, Warren.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.729
- What the hell did you do to John Ellis?
- It's all good.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.451
- You know how much of the studio I own?
- The whole thing.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.090
Yeah, well, fix it, Ari.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.208
It's done. Thank you, Warren.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.167
- Ari! Ari!
- I can't now, Jess.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.049
Are you kidding me?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.649
I just got off the phone
with fucking Kives...

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.883
and he said that you still haven't
greenlit my passion project.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.566
- No, I know. Jess, we're going...
- What the fuck?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.406
Do you think I give a shit about
zombie apocalypse? What the fuck is that?

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.403
I'm dealing with
a first-time director here...

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.610
who's more interested in Instagramming
my ass. Hashtag "Jessica Alba's ass."

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.364
- Well...
- Are you kidding me?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.127
Look me in the face.
I'm gonna walk off this project...

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.601
- ...if you don't greenlight my movie.
- Done.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.404
- Swear.
- I swear to you, it's done.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.641
- Swear.
- It's done.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.251
- On your mom.
- Yeah, on my mom.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.810
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.611
- Relax, John. Your heart.
- I don't have a heart problem.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.728
No, but you're old. Heh.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.041
You think this is funny?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.123
You told me when I took this job that
I wouldn't have to answer to McCredle.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.204
I didn't know you would
go over budget on your first shot.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.045
It doesn't matter what a movie costs.
Only what it makes.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.568
- This one is going to make...
- Ari, I put my reputation on the line...

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.921
to get you this job.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.764
No, you begged me to take this job.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.843
Actually, you begged me
to take your job.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.641
And then you took your offer back and
told me that you were going to groom me.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.089
- For one year.
- And this is your idea of grooming?

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.288
This is the new world. We're all in it.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.566
We minimize our risk.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.044
And maximize our position as pussies
by kowtowing to cowtippers?

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.848
I told you, with this movie, I didn't want
any of their fucking farm money.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.042
- I didn't need it.
- The board disagreed.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.165
And so did I.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.164
About how much you spent
and about how you made it.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.811
So this is all about Vince.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.601
Nobody thought he had any business
directing this film. You bullied it through.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.280
That's why you wanted me to succeed you.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.761
- I bully everything through.
- See it any way you like.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.010
I'm taking you off this movie.
Dana Gordon is in charge now.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.970
We made a great movie
that this idiot is trying to fuck up.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.091
This idiot's father owns half
the fucking negative, and you know it.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.641
He can toss it in the garbage
if he decides to.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.121
- You have the...
- Dana has this covered.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.890
You stay the fuck out of it.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.530
Hey, John. You can't do this.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.648
Ari, I just did.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.491
Yo, E, what the fuck?
I've been calling you for two hours.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.008
Sorry, my phone's dead. You cannot
imagine what I've been dealing with.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.289
- These girls here are crazy.
- I'm never touching another one again.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.807
Why, because of this
or because no one'll let you?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.371
Guys, you know I love you all,
but right now...

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.204
I don't give a fuck
about what you're talking about.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.888
We got a real problem with this Travis guy, and
I need my manager-producer back now, okay?

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.246
Okay.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.244
Did Ari tell you why he's not gonna
release the money?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.602
- He didn't like the movie?
- What didn't he like?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.566
Is it me?

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.969
Please, for the love of God,
tell me it's not me he didn't like.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.521
What kind of a sick,
narcissistic fuck are you?

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.127
- Not everything in the world is about you.
- Seriously, Drama.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.846
Just cut me out, bro.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.121
Johnny, stop.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.361
No, I get it.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.601
Just cut me.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.564
The good life wasn't meant for me.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.526
I was given the gift of delusional
confidence, but not any real talent.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.563
Will you shut up and put that shit down?

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.685
- You should be drinking my tequila anyway.
- Real men drink whiskey, Turtle.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.371
Vince.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.884
I don't want you to fuck up your movie
because of me, bro.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.407
You're worth more
to the universe than I am.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.005
And I'm finally okay with that.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.171
Johnny.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.846
This movie is what it is
because of you...

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.201
and because of E...

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.931
and even Turtle.
Because we do things we love.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.482
Not things some rich prick, whose daddy
gives him everything, tells us to.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.406
You're really good in this movie.
Tell him, guys.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.971
I didn't even think you could act
until I saw this.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.161
Thanks.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.890
Don't worry, we'll handle it.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.487
If it doesn't work out, we can always
move back to Queens with Ma, right?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.769
I don't wanna go back to Queens, bro!

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.160
I'll handle it.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.601
I like the weather out here too much.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.570
- Hello?
- Guess what?

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.769
I know who you are:
Tarvold from Viking Quest.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.570
And I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.529
Hey, pal, guess what?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.411
I'm already dead.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.883
So fucking bring it!

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.722
Hey! There he is.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.962
- Travis. Thanks for making the time.
- No, thank you for coming to me.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.360
- How are you?
- You're sitting in on this too?

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.410
Uh, yeah.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.045
Okay. Look.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.521
I'm real sorry about earlier, Vince.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.643
- But that Ari just wouldn't let me be heard.
- Probably being protective. He's like that.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.883
Well, I'm just being protective
of my money. I'm like that.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.644
- We understand that.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.201
I know we met before,
but what is your involvement in this again?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.681
- I'm the producer of the movie.
- And my manager.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.001
Oh, yeah!

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.051
Uh, you were the guy on Piers Morgan,
spinning pizza dough, right?

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.931
Vince, you take care of more people
than Red Cross, huh?

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.082
I like to think they take care of me.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.527
It's probably best
to think of it that way, yeah.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.451
Uh, so listen, I'd love to hear
your thoughts on the movie.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.961
- I know you have some issues with my brother.
- Yeah.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.610
- He's not good.
- Well...

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.367
- Yeah, I disagree.
- It's probably because you're too close to it.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.245
You can't see it clearly
because he's your brother.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.044
As an artist, I'm pretty unbiased.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.966
Maybe there's a bigger issue that's
making you not like his character, Travis.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.964
He's pretty pivotal in the movie,
including the final scene.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.247
I don't understand
how you could cut him out.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.845
Yeah, I think that bigger issue thing
makes sense.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.731
Oh. Did you have other problems
with the movie?

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.282
- Yeah, I did. I gave Ari a whole list.
- Maybe you could be more specific.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.564
You're putting me
in an awkward position here, Vince...

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.529
because not only are you the director,
you're the star.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.921
It's okay. I won't take
anything personally.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.810
With a movie, there are so many parts
that have to come together.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.008
So tell me, what exactly
didn't you like?

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.082
Well, okay.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.250
Aside from your brother...

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.481
I didn't like you.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.370
Understand, this is really strange for me,
because I really am a big fan of yours.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.764
I'm probably the only person in the whole world
who liked that Medellin thing that you did.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.765
But, with this, you know, it's like
you were trying to do this kooky thing...

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.810
like Johnny Depp did
in Pirates of the Caribbean.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.606
Now, what he did, he went out on a limb.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.649
And it could've been stupid,
but, God, it worked.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.729
What you did here, though...

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.281
it just didn't.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.442
Maybe that's because you directed it...

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.046
and all you had was your buddy
looking over your shoulder.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.282
You don't have anyone
who can come in and say:

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:30.410
"Hey, this is getting kinda fucked up
and goofy."

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.203
But it most certainly was.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.479
You should've punched him
right in the fucking face.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.008
- Oh, believe me, I thought about it.
- Maybe we are too close to it. Maybe I do suck.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.560
- Pfft.
- You know what, bro?

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.803
If you do, at least we suck together.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.846
- It's good, right, baby?
- Yes, Ari.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.682
- You like it?
- Yes.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.649
- But do you love it?
- I love it.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.168
- You wouldn't lie to me, would you?
- No.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.806
- Then say it again.
- I love it, Ari.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.041
- Say it again, honey.
- I love it!

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.407
It's the best movie Vince has ever done!

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.641
Now can we finish?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.401
The meds are still in me, baby.
I'm not sure I can.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.810
Then get off because I was done,
like, 20 minutes ago.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.526
I'm sorry.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.728
It's this kid. He's killing me.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.167
I know I haven't been great
to you lately, baby.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.445
You know that I didn't come back for
the money. I came back to leave a legacy.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.689
To make my family proud.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.443
And I wanna go out on my own terms.
And this kid is trying to hobble me.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.204
Like Tonya Harding.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.087
And I can't have it because he's wrong.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.971
Drama sucking,
I could've maybe bought that.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.201
But Vince?

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.284
No. I'm a million percent sure
he is wrong.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.482
It's just his opinion.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.489
What can you do?

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.560
Thanks, Hector. I won't be long.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.961
- What, Ari, no suit?
- Not tonight, DV.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.050
Who told you where I was staying?

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.485
My office booked your room for you.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.971
- Can I come in?
- No.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.088
You haven't returned any of my calls.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.322
- Ari, I have people here.
- I don't mind.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.289
Oh. Sorry about that.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.205
Didn't realize you were
in the middle of a work session.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.410
Maybe I should call security and have your ass
dragged out. How would you like that?

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.241
I am sorry about that, but we do have
what are known as protocols.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.125
- Even in this lawless town.
- My father wants to shoot you.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.203
We could have a Mexican standoff, then.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.121
Because after looking at your long list
of proposed changes to my movie...

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.848
I wanna shoot myself because
they don't make any fucking sense.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.331
I agree.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.286
- With what?
- I'm grasping at straws here, Ari.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.169
I don't know how to fix my problems.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.527
- Vincent Chase's great in this movie.
- Bullshit.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.685
He sucks. His too-pretty face ruins
the fucking thing. It's distracting.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.611
How the hell are you gonna fix
his face with editing?

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.484
I guess I'm not.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.608
Which is why I told my father
we should bite the bullet...

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.370
put some more money into it...

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.490
and reshoot it with new actors
and a different director.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.923
Reshoot? Do you have any idea
what that'll cost?

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.889
That's your job to figure out.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.089
But I'll bet that there's a cheap way
to do it digitally.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.006
Hell, I saw Tupac Shakur
in concert last year.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.640
That guy's been dead 20 years.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.848
You had no problem
with Vince at the party.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.570
A fan, even.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.563
Did something happen?

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.288
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.962
- What happened?
- I don't know what you're talking about, Ari.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.044
But if you don't leave right now,
I really will call security.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.247
This guy's really gonna screw up
$100 million movie...

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.085
- ...because of a personal problem?
- That's what Ari says.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.449
- Says he wants to replace me with a hologram.
- Can they even do that?

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.007
I was replaced
with a digital character once.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.889
But that was before filming began.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.447
What could I possibly
have done to this guy?

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.286
Did you shake hands when you met him?
Southerners, real particular about manners.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.885
I think so.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.168
Oh, boy. Armie Hammer, 12 o'clock.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.601
Oh, good God.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.684
Yo, Vinnie Chase. The DJ from hell.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.047
- What's up, Armie?
- What's up?

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.249
- You know that I was dating Emily, right?
- Emily? I thought you guys broke up.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.289
I don't see how that fucking matters.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.322
No, this isn't the time or the place.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.842
But just know that I will enjoy
sneaking up behind you...

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.570
and snatching the fucking life
out of you.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.567
You know what I'm talking about,
right, Drama?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.489
You guys enjoy your salads.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.486
- That was awkward.
- He's a lot bigger than I thought.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.722
Why didn't you just tell him
it wasn't true?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.291
Because it is true.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.410
- Really. Since when?
- Since after the screening.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.282
I went over there later, after she was
done watching the movie with Travis.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.001
What?

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.324
A girl? This whole thing
is over a fucking girl?

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.686
You guys are being crazy.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.689
I can't believe you were with Emily
and you didn't tell us.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.881
Why would I tell you?

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.929
Because most of the fun
of being with a girl that hot...

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.448
- ...is that you get to tell your friends about it.
- Turtle, I think we define "fun" differently.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.762
- I can't believe this.
- Believe what?

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.922
There's no way Travis
could know about this.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.491
- No way.
- Why not?

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.411
He probably waited outside of her house
after she got rid of him.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.921
We're the only ones dumb enough
to not realize you'd go over there.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.003
Come on. That's ridiculous.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.721
- Think he drives a yellow Lamborghini?
- I know it. He had it on the lot. Why?

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.522
Jesus fuck.
You couldn't just hold off one night?

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.571
- We're a year into this thing.
- Seriously, Vin. This will set up our next 20.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.161
- And give me a life.
- I hope she was worth it.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.290
You really saying I should've kept away
from her because of him?

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.283
I mean, is that who we are?

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.449
- I would've banged her.
- Yeah, me too.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.126
- Wife might even give me a pass for her.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.009
- Fuck him.
- No, seriously. Fuck him.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.447
We don't need him.
I'll put up the eight million.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.847
How much fucking money
did this guy make?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.288
Vin, I'm serious. Not just because
I love you. I love this movie.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.244
I appreciate it, Turtle,
but I can't let you do that.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.329
- I'll put up the money.
- I'll split it.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.323
- Thank you.
- I'm strapped, bro.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.209
All the love in this room is really
fucking touching, but you can't.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.328
It's McCredle's movie.
He doesn't need or want your money.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.086
- So that's it?
- No. I will handle this, as usual.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.163
- How?
- Don't worry, Carrot Bottom.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.606
I got ideas. Later.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.604
- Later.
- Later.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.164
I can't believe
there's nothing we can do.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.210
I got an audition at 3.
Who wants to run lines with me?

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.885
- No way.
- Not a chance.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.481
- Ronda finally answered my text.
- What'd she say?

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.685
She said, "If you want to apologize,
do it in person like a man."

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.365
You guys wanna come with?

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.050
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.602
You are the master of your universe...

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.969
- ...if you control your own physical universe.
- Om.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.567
I will solve this problem.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.731
Calmness and control of breath...

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.322
- ...are keys to success.
- Om.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.246
I will figure this out.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.927
Put fear to the side...

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.721
- ...for fear will conquer you.
- Om.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.482
I will let no man see the darkness
inside of me.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.486
Om.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.720
I will learn how to stop this fucking phone
from overtaking my fucking calming CD!

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.121
- What?
- About the wedding, Ari.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.964
Lloyd, I've got bigger problems...

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.283
than who's gonna give you away
at your big fat gay wedding.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.601
Call your boys at Grindr.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.603
- I'm sure there's an app for that.
- Listen, Ari...

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.081
I just got finished talking
to a classroom of 8th graders...

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.521
about the future
of the agenting business.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.844
And as I looked at their little faces, it hit me.
My father is not coming to my wedding.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.485
That is not my problem, Lloyd.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.927
- Do you know why he's not coming?
- I don't care.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.004
It's because he hasn't spoken to me
since I came out.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.562
He didn't know before that? Who is he,
the guy from The Crying Game?

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.890
- You're the closest thing I have to a father now.
- Lloyd! I can't deal with this.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.964
Not while I'm trying to figure out
how to save this movie...

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.169
which is the most important investment
I have ever made.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.971
You invest in people, Ari, not product.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.600
That's why I have succeeded,
and that's why you will.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.330
- Oh, and Ari?
- What?

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.720
I love you.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.526
Fuck! Fuck!

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.205
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.930
Fuck!

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.011
Still time to leave.
I don't think she saw you yet.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.410
Oops.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.686
Too late.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.485
Hey, Ronda.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.522
Hey, Turtle. What, do you bring
your backup dancers everywhere?

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.526
Sorry, Vince.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.409
- You said if I wanted to apologize...
- What is there to apologize about?

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.769
- I didn't want you to have the wrong idea.
- What was the right idea?

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.001
I wanted...

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.846
- Yeah, I want to take you out.
- So then why this talk about us doing business?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.925
Because this guy got in my head, telling me
there's no way you'd be interested in me.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.444
Not very manly to let another guy
influence what you do with a lady, bro.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.840
Especially this guy.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.244
Listen, Ronda. Turtle's shy
and he really likes you.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.084
He could care less about business.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.642
- Everyone in this town has an angle.
- I don't. I really, really don't.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.810
Let me prove it. What do you wanna do?
You wanna take me in the ring?

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.406
- I'll let you beat me up for a round.
- Let me?

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.683
Heh-heh. You know, he does box
and do some cardio.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.210
I meant, like, I won't fight back.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.489
You couldn't last 30 seconds with me
if your life depended on it.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.885
- I could really hurt you.
- I last 30 seconds...

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.442
- ...you let me take you on a date.
- Last 60 and I'll let you fuck me.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.925
- How much time?
- Three seconds!

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.009
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Something!

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.366
- Anything!
- Pray!

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.482
- She's got the armbar!
- That's not good!

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.880
- Tap out, Turtle!
- Time?

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.280
Fifteen seconds!

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.805
Tap or I'll break it.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.962
- How much time?
- Ten seconds!

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.849
- Do you think I'm bluffing?
- Tap out!

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.650
- You won't do it!
- It isn't worth it, Turtle.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.768
- Don't tap out!
- Ronda, I don't quit.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.048
- I just wanted to take you to dinner!
- Fine!

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.611
- Oh!
- Aagh!

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.486
Larsen McCredle's office.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.323
- It's Ari Gold again.
- Mr. Gold, I have told you 20 times already...

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.801
Mr. McCredle is unavailable
to speak with you.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.883
And I told you 20 times
I need to speak with him.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.650
- Where's Dana?
- Meeting.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.043
Try him again and tell him
it's an emergency regarding his son.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.531
Everything okay with Travis?

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.364
- Have you seen the movie Taken?
- Yes.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.568
Think of me
as the Liam Neeson character...

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.644
and Mr. McCredle as my target
if I don't hear back from him.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.808
- Have you heard back from Dana?
- She's still in that meeting.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.042
- What meeting?
- Laura didn't know.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.682
- Have you tried John Ellis again?
- Yes. Apparently he's in the same meeting.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.490
Think the Texas money guy's in town.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.644
And you don't think this is information
that I could've used?

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.847
Where is this meeting?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.207
I'm not supposed to say.
I can call Dana.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.610
- Where's the fucking meeting?
- John's house in Santa Barbara.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.808
- Should I tell them you're coming?
- Nope!

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.489
Tell them to build
a big fucking bomb shelter.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.648
No, I didn't study these dance moves.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.404
I was born with them.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.245
No, I didn't study these dance moves.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.562
Ah...

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.370
- Euripides. Euripides.
- Uh...

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.363
Can you do that to yourself, please?

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.488
It's my process, asshole.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.409
- Euripides. Aeschylus.
- Douchebag.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.643
Lemona, lumina, lino...
Lemona, luminum, linoleum.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.131
Yeah, hey, Mom.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.524
No, I'm just on this lame audition
with a bunch of shitheads. Yeah.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.045
- Johnny Chase?
- Yeah.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.406
You're next.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.767
Oh. Don't fuck this up, Drama.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.604
- Fuck you.
- We know you will.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.489
- Jimmy Chase is next.
- Hey.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.765
- Hey, Richard. I didn't know you were doing this.
- Yeah.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.770
That's great. Now I'm excited.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.571
Aw, thanks.
Well, thanks for coming in, Jimmy.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.848
- "Jimmy"?
- No?

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.408
- No. Johnny.
- Oh. That's my fault.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.211
I'm so sorry. It's "Johnny."
I told him "Jimmy."

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.647
There was a Jimmy in earlier.
I think that's it.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.491
He's Vinnie Chase's brother.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.523
I know. Yeah.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.848
You're Vinnie Chase's brother?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.331
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.842
- You look nothing like him.
- Not even a little.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.286
You know, we've met before.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.801
- We have?
- Yeah. West Wing.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.964
- Did you do an episode?
- No, I got cast in the pilot.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.688
And then replaced after the table read.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.208
- Huh. Well, you missed a pretty good run.
- Heh.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.686
Uh, any notes before I get started?

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.683
Nope. No notes, Johnny.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.047
Whenever you're ready,
Sarah will read with you.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.480
Okay.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.768
- Did you go to school for dance?
- Oh, my God.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.483
- What?
- I'm sorry. Nothing.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.489
- Just keep going.
- What?

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.482
Did you go to school for dance?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.286
No, I didn't study these dance moves.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.209
I was born with them.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.169
- Oh, my God!
- What?

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.488
Sorry, Johnny.
We're getting all this on tape.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.608
It's great,
just keep reading with Sarah.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.367
- Sarah, keep going with the...
- Would you describe yourself as flexible?

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.727
Well, I guess you could say
I am pretty limber.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.484
Jesus Christ!

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.721
Are you guys joking?

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.121
- I'm trying to act here.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.408
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.688
We're looking at you, Johnny.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.530
We're looking at you.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.081
Are you familiar
with the penal code in this county?

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.925
Here's the good news:
I won't ever forget you again.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.844
TMZ presents:

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.970
Raw Emotion with Johnny Chase.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.407
Oh, yeah. Oh...

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.811
We got a sex tape
from a huge star...'s brother.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.521
Oh, you like that?

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.445
He was video chatting with this girl,
it turned into sex...

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.127
- her boyfriend posted it to Revenge Girlfriends.
- And cut to the Chase!

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.487
Oh, my fucking God.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.084
Oh, good merciful God.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.042
Oh, my God.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.807
- Oh, God.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.008
Oh, my God. I know this fucking kid.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.889
Oh, my God.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.484
Oh, my God.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.161
Oh, my God!

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.040
- Over here, Johnny!
- What the fuck you looking at?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.920
How about I shove
that camera up your ass, huh?

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.650
What are you looking at?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.723
Stop fucking looking at me.
What are you looking at?

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.961
You got a problem?

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.605
Stop looking at me.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.288
I can't believe
you just ignored me yesterday.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.647
- I wasn't ignoring you.
- He wasn't ignoring you.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.609
Really? We're all gonna do this? Okay.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.923
- He didn't respond.
- He had some crazy things happen yesterday.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.401
- He didn't call me today.
- You probably should've called today, E.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.642
- I didn't know what to say.
- He didn't know what to say.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.491
For six months,
he begs me to take him back.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.201
Now I say I'm willing to try,
and he doesn't know what to say?

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.569
- She's got a lot of anger towards me.
- Maybe you should save this for later.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.643
I said I'll keep trying to get over it.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.883
- He's right. Maybe we should save it till later.
- No, I think we should talk about this now.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.526
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.809
Why not? You've been here
for everything else but the conception.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.724
Good point. E, say something.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.446
Stop.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.682
Look, Sloan, I love you, okay? You know that.
And there's nobody else I'd rather be with.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.049
But there's no more trying.
You're either over the past or not.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.488
Yo. Guess who's got the strongest bones
in the Assante family?

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.244
- No break?
- Nope. Torn labrum.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.481
But dinner with Ronda is on.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.847
So, Sloan, any way
we can get this labor process cranking?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.571
Really?

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.444
See what I'm saying? Let's go!

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.681
You guys were stopped.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.086
Ari, are you fucking crazy?
You can't land there!

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.005
Ah, but, John, I just did.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.041
Hello.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.125
Must not have gotten my invite.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.564
Wow.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.370
I know all of you.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.005
Mr. Tisch, we shared a suite
at the Super Bowl.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.686
Must not be the difference maker
that you claimed.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.047
Meldman, all those nights in Cabo...

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.045
Meaningless.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.089
Larsen, you must not have gotten
all my messages.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.402
And you must be a lot tougher
than you look.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.450
Okay, this room is gonna be
even more hostile than I thought.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.049
Which is interesting because I heard
the purpose of this meeting was to fire me.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:03.807
- Where'd you hear that?
- I heard it up here, John.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.008
Not from you,
who I've known for 20 years.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.322
Not from you, Dana, who I used to...

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.642
Anyway, you wanna fire me...

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.565
because Mr. McCredle's son...

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.769
doesn't like the movie that I made.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.601
Well, I don't think
you know the whole story.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.490
Oh, really, Gold?

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.211
Well, I can't wait to hear
the fucking fairy tale you spin.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.850
Heh. Me too.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.445
Shut up, Travis.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.409
Travis doesn't really hate the movie.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.680
He hates Vince.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.842
- Dad, he's so full of shit.
- What'd I say?

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.361
- Do you want a boot up your ass?
- No.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.329
Now, I have a son, so this is hard.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.004
Well, speak, goddamn it.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.650
This whole thing is over a girl.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.001
- What girl?
- Dad, the...

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.605
Shut up!

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.447
What fucking girl, Gold?

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.761
Emily Ratajkowski.

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.285
Oh, I like her.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.489
- I do too.
- I don't know what he's talking about.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.802
Oh, come on, Travis.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.882
You mean to tell me
that you didn't sit outside her house...

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.522
after she told you good night,
just waiting to see if Vince showed up.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.604
He fucking snuck in there after me.
I put in a whole night w...

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.962
Wow, I wasn't even 100 percent sure
I was right.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.202
You should know this, Travis,
that's what movie stars are supposed to do.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.806
Walk into rooms
and fuck girls that civilians want.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.411
That's why they're movie stars.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.769
- You causing trouble over pussy again?
- Dad, this is our money.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.081
We financed this film.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.801
I don't think that that pretty boy out there
should be allowed to shit on me.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.690
Wait outside.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.241
Are you serious?

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.448
Yes, goddamn it. Wait outside.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.009
I'm real sorry about that.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.170
Um, I have a copy of the movie.
Vinnie Chase's unfinished cut.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:56.881
I think if you look at it, you're gonna see
that your money is in secure hands.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.084
- I saw it last night, Larsen.
- Really?

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.321
What'd you think?

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:03.687
It's amazing.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.609
I told you. Mwah.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.404
Well, I don't need to see
the damn movie.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.326
You people do what you do, but, uh,
if anybody wants to see more of my money...

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.209
he still has to go.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.205
Larsen, you heard what happened.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.931
What I heard is he treated my son
like a horse's ass...

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.526
which he is,
but that's not really the point.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.487
- You said you have a son, Gold?
- I do. He's 12.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.487
Well, I hope when he grows up, he's not
a complete and utter fucking buffoon like mine.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.888
But just in case he is...

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.963
I hope the people that respect you...

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.162
at least pretend to respect him.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.129
I can't believe a website
would actually post something like that.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.126
They posted it as "See Vincent Chase's
Brother Spank It at Vincent Chase's Pool."

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.089
- That was my pool?
- Mine.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.280
Well, I guess a sex tape
worked for Paris and Kim.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.603
- Maybe it'll do good for Johnny.
- Vin, a girl playing with herself is one thing.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.728
Drama doing it,
a whole horrifying other.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.963
Absolutely the most vile,
disgusting thing I've ever fucking seen.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.851
- Okay, Shauna. Have you heard from him?
- No. Why, is he missing?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.970
- Called him 10 times. He won't pick up.
- Try him again, please?

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.248
I can get his face on a milk carton.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.360
- You need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.445
I'm here because I can't calm down,
and I need to see the doctor...

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.443
who can hopefully calm me down.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.602
Mr. Chase, he is in with someone.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.082
Oh, is he in with someone
who's been coming here for 15 years?

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.881
Somebody who scraped up loose change
when insurance wouldn't pay his bill?

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.850
Is he in with someone whose life
is in complete shambles?

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.884
Are you suicidal?

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.171
I don't know.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.970
- Well, if you aren't...
- I am!

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.363
- Let me call 911, have an ambulance come.
- No, no, no. Don't do that.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.130
What are you looking at?

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.369
- What?
- What's on your screen?

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.760
Nothing.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.970
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.690
I'm a dead man!

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.571
I need the doctor.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.287
Doc Feldman. It's Johnny Chase.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.762
I've been your patient since you were
at the strip mall in Sherman Oaks.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.363
I need you right now, goddamn it,
so get your ass out here.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.810
I'm dying.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.121
Put the phone down.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.446
Sorry.

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.881
Mother...

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.007
What, Turtle, what? Will you please
stop calling? I can't talk right now.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.366
What?

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.806
Really?

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.450
Johnny, what the hell is going on?

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.283
Nothing, doc. All good.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.204
I'm having a baby.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.488
Congratulations.
You have a brand-new baby girl.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.126
Thank you.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.569
She's amazing.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.890
She looks just like you.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.043
Ryan Murphy, 6 pounds 4 ounces,
born 19 minutes ago.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.004
- You're a daddy! Come here.
- Congrats.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.043
- Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.248
- How's Sloan?
- She's over it.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.129
Do we have ourselves a baby?

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.523
Because in the grand scheme of things,
what the fuck else matters?

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.489
- We got a baby girl!
- You're kidding.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.210
- Name?
- Ryan.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.566
Ryan Murphy?

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.841
Yeah, you like it?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.810
I read for the teacher on Glee
six times and didn't get it.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.564
But, yeah, I like it! I really like it!

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.401
- Piers Morgan?
- Why is Piers Morgan calling you?

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.607
Hello?

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.569
- Hey, Vince. It's Piers Morgan here.
- Hey, Piers.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:58.361
- If this is about Emily, no comment.
- I've got no interest in your sex life.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.683
I'm calling to see if you've got
any comment to make about Ari Gold?

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.491
- As far as what?
- Well, as far as the big breaking news.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.290
He just resigned from the studio.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.169
I gotta call you back.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.962
What's with the stunned face?
Please don't tell me the baby looks like E.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.209
Yeah, I resigned.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.921
That's just how I spun it
to save myself the humiliation.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.809
Truth is, they fired me.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.851
- Ari, I feel awful. This is all because of me.
- No, it's because of me.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.404
I got a big ego.

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.484
But there's a reason for that.
It's because I'm always right!

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.722
Must have a big buyout, though, no?

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.248
What, am I on CNBC, Turtle?

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.927
- Yeah, it would've been, even by your standards.
- "Would've been"?

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.201
Thirty million.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.729
- I told them to lick my balls. I don't take charity.
- You're gonna let them keep $30 million?

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.089
No. Come on. I told them I want
an equity stake in the movie for it.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.720
Ari, are you serious?
You could lose all your money.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.649
You're my Mentos man, Vinnie.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.649
Fifteen years we've been together.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.729
You think I'm gonna abandon ship now?

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.201
Not even if the water's freezing
and the orchestra's playing.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.885
Great, a Titanic reference.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.929
Come on, Ari. Hyde's gonna be a monster.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.003
You just said you're always right.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.321
Until I'm wrong.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.889
I'm kidding, Drama. Lighten up.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.522
Warren Buffett's gonna be blowing us
for investment advice soon. You'll see.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.685
I'm proud of you, Vinnie.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.842
I'm real proud. Proud of all of you.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.889
- Thanks, Ari.
- Congrats again on the baby.

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.206
Thanks again.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.766
Later.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.281
Later.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.887
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the 72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.805
We're on the red carpet live.
This is where you want to be.

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.567
Maria, already people are asking
the question: Who will the big winners be?

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.165
If you've been paying attention...

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.291
you probably get the idea that Vincent Chase
and Hyde are gonna have a huge night.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.521
That's right, Matt.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.242
Hyde has been a box office monster
with $450 million worldwide and counting...

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.051
five nominations, including Best Picture
and two acting nods.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.611
And that surprise of the year.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.883
You have a Best Supporting Actor
nomination for Johnny Chase...

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.088
and he's only in four scenes
in the movie.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.722
What'd I tell you, Turtle?
You visualize success, you get it.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.008
But you've been visualizing it
for 20 years.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.811
No. I've been verbalizing it.
There's a difference.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.691
Do you think he'll be more difficult
to handle if he wins?

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.365
- Definitely.
- Vincent Chase!

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.240
Hey, Terrence.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.883
- Congrats on everything. So how does it feel?
- Yeah, I don't wanna speak for baby bro...

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.084
- ...but it feels sick, Terrence.
- You can quote me on that.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.087
Congratulations.
You're getting a lot of credit...

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.607
for the work you did
behind the scenes on this movie.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.246
Well, I'm a little more creative
than people give me credit for.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.927
I hear you have other offers.
Can you tell us, will you run another studio?

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.163
Maria, I may run a country.
There are a few that could use my help.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.010
Johnny! Look over here!

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.006
- Mr. Chase!
- Vince!

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.850
And the award for Best Supporting Actor
in a Motion Picture goes to...

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.849
Get the fuck out of here.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.364
Sorry. I haven't seen
the movie yet. I...

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.810
I imagine he's fantastic.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.122
Give it up! Johnny Chase, Hyde!

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.326
You won!

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.448
- Get up!
- You won!

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.085
- Get up there!
- Go!

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.241
Go!

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.770
Drama!

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.765
You can fuck it later. You speak.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.766
Victory!

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.240
Yeah!

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.844
You're doing fine, Lloyd.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.725
Thank you, Ari.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.961
And you?

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.610
I may throw up.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.690
Just breathe.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.800
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.649
today we gather to celebrate
one of life's greatest moments.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.569
The commitment that these two men
are about to make...

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.569
is the most important commitment...

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.091
anyone can make.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.449
If you're not really gay, Lloyd,
now's probably the time to say so.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.530
And if you are, Ari,
this is probably your time.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.761
Don't kid yourself, Sulu.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.690
Mazel tov!

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.685
Congratulations, Greg and Lloyd!

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.564
Who's the girl?

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.081
- This is Alyssa Miller.
- Hi.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.961
I don't understand.

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.090
- Lloyd wanted a Jewish wedding?
- No. My house, my God.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.925
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim, bitches!

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:43.410
Vinnie! Get in here. Come on,
we need a group shot. Come here.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.641
I just don't like it.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.009
Maybe you just don't fucking get it,
you bean-counting little suit.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.322
- Ask Vince. See what he thinks.
- What's that?

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.960
- I got an idea.
- Oh, yeah? What is it?

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.529
- It's about Vinnie and the boys.
- Ha-ha.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.489
And how they started from nothing...

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.291
- ...turned it into all of this.
- Yeah.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.847
- Dumbest idea I've heard.
- I don't know. Is it?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.684
- Maybe it's a TV show.
- Yeah.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.001
Maybe I could direct.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.164
Maybe Turtle, Sloan, Ronda
or the fucking baby can.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.446
Ari.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.206
Okay. Everybody get together and smile.
