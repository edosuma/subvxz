01:21.364 --> 01:23.864
We just crossed the border.

01:25.368 --> 01:28.287
The pilot said we just Ieft Thailand.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.247
He's not a happy guy.

01:30.248 --> 01:32.124
I don't blame him.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.085
The situation is worse
than when we Ieft home, Mac.

01:35.086 --> 01:38.797
This new regime has started
to eliminate disruptive elements,

01:38.798 --> 01:41.675
and the orphanage is sitting
right in the middle of the worst of it.

01:41.676 --> 01:44.052
They won't be safe
until we get them out.

01:44.053 --> 01:46.972
I know seeing Debra again
isn't going to be easy for you.

01:46.973 --> 01:49.099
Yeah, it's been a while.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.311
- How about you and Sister Margaret?
- Last time I saw Margaret,

01:52.312 --> 01:58.452
she was being chased across the
Sahara with 15 children and a goat.

02:07.952 --> 02:11.955
Sister Margaret. Sister Margaret.
Soldiers coming for you and Debra.

02:11.956 --> 02:15.959
Chanthara's men, they come for you.
I saw them on the road.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.173
Take the children.
You must go now.

02:20.506 --> 02:23.008
Children, come with me. Hurry.

02:23.009 --> 02:26.011
- Debra, get the children together.
- This way, come on.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.922
Quickly, we're going inside now.

02:30.224 --> 02:32.601
I can't get any closer
to the orphanage.

02:32.602 --> 02:36.855
They have patrols around.
They'II hear the chopper.

02:36.856 --> 02:43.706
Pick us up at the clearing half a mile
east of the orphanage in two hours.

02:44.155 --> 02:47.491
- Debra, hurry.
- Coming, Sister.

02:48.033 --> 02:49.534
This way.

02:49.535 --> 02:52.575
Hurry up. Follow her. Here we go.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.067
AII right, there we go.

03:25.487 --> 03:28.031
- Thank you.
- Up you go.

03:33.871 --> 03:36.581
Mac, I have just one question
about rappelling:

03:36.582 --> 03:38.583
What do you do if the Iine breaks?

03:38.584 --> 03:41.084
You fall.

03:58.979 --> 04:02.606
Watch your step.
Now, hold on tight, but hurry.

04:02.607 --> 04:05.109
Don't be frightened. Keep moving.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.445
Here, I've got you.

04:07.446 --> 04:11.240
Now, wait for me in the tunnel.
Be careful. Kahn, it's your turn.

04:11.241 --> 04:17.961
No, Sister. I will stay here and talk
to the soldiers until you get away.

04:18.415 --> 04:20.833
Kahn, you've been Iike family to us.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.960
You know what that means
to Chanthara.

04:22.961 --> 04:25.421
What can he do to me?

04:25.422 --> 04:27.172
I'm old.

04:27.173 --> 04:30.903
We must make sure
the children are safe.

04:42.313 --> 04:44.813
God bless you.

05:23.187 --> 05:24.479
Not rushing you, am I?

05:24.480 --> 05:27.315
Listen, I may get there slower, Mac,
but I get there.

05:27.316 --> 05:29.816
Did I ever tell you the-- ?

05:29.861 --> 05:32.361
Pete, Iet's go!

05:38.744 --> 05:41.364
- Everybody out!
- Let's go.

05:48.045 --> 05:52.549
- Where are the American women?
- Gone. Across the border.

05:52.550 --> 05:57.054
I admire your Ioyalty,
but I know they're here.

05:57.555 --> 05:59.889
They have spread Iies
about our government.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.933
You have no respect.

06:01.934 --> 06:05.271
Sister Margaret is a woman of God.

06:05.437 --> 06:07.689
Our people are oppressed.

06:07.690 --> 06:10.970
You sin against the Saviour if you--

06:21.912 --> 06:25.290
Look inside. Search the area.

06:54.695 --> 06:57.571
I've always Iiked
being close to nature.

06:57.572 --> 07:00.325
Yeah, me too.

07:04.621 --> 07:08.124
AII right, children, I want each one
of you to take a blanket now.

07:08.125 --> 07:11.085
We'II stay here until we're safe.

07:11.086 --> 07:14.881
Sister, we have to get to the border.

07:15.757 --> 07:18.425
- We'II wait until tonight.
- No, we have to go now.

07:18.426 --> 07:20.803
It's too dangerous for them.

07:20.804 --> 07:22.638
What if Chanthara's men
are out there?

07:22.639 --> 07:25.309
What if they find the tunnel?

07:30.438 --> 07:32.106
- Stay with them.
- No.

07:32.107 --> 07:34.483
I'II go find us a way across.

07:34.484 --> 07:35.901
Don't worry.

07:35.902 --> 07:38.862
I was a sprinter in high school.

07:39.114 --> 07:41.614
I'II be back in a flash.

07:44.786 --> 07:47.286
You're cold. Here.

07:48.289 --> 07:50.749
Yes.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.250
You doing all right?

08:05.515 --> 08:07.557
The orphanage has gotta be
this way.

08:07.558 --> 08:11.048
Can't be more
than a couple hundred--

08:21.531 --> 08:22.948
Pete.

08:22.949 --> 08:25.743
You're kneeling on my hand.

08:38.506 --> 08:40.674
- Debra.
- MacGyver.

08:40.674 --> 08:42.842
Oh, God.

08:42.842 --> 08:45.343
I don't believe it.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.890
What are you doing here?

08:50.768 --> 08:53.812
We'II explain Iater.
Where is Sister Margaret?

08:53.813 --> 08:57.191
Back at the cave. This way.

09:02.530 --> 09:06.741
MacGyver, by the time you read this,
I'll be gone.

09:06.742 --> 09:08.576
Please understand that leaving you

09:08.577 --> 09:11.788
was the hardest decision
I ever had to make.

09:11.789 --> 09:14.582
But it was one that had to be made.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.043
I'll always remember you.

09:17.044 --> 09:22.090
And I'll always love the memory
of what we had together.

09:22.091 --> 09:24.591
Debra.

09:32.059 --> 09:35.019
Aren't you just a Iittle hungry?

09:35.270 --> 09:39.130
Here, now just a Iittle bit.
Oh, come on.

09:39.691 --> 09:42.191
That's a good girl.

09:42.986 --> 09:45.486
Want a Iittle more?

09:56.833 --> 09:59.333
Sister Margaret?

10:01.088 --> 10:03.464
Peter.

10:03.465 --> 10:05.965
Peter Thornton.

10:06.468 --> 10:09.303
Well, you always said
I had a standing invitation.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.973
Oh, thank God you're here.

10:14.643 --> 10:17.896
Hello, Maggie. You Iook wonderful.

10:18.647 --> 10:21.847
You're not Iooking so bad yourself.

10:24.820 --> 10:28.113
Hey, Iisten, I'm sorry about
that tackle out there.

10:28.114 --> 10:31.408
The second time I've fallen for you.

10:31.409 --> 10:33.410
Your hair's Ionger than it used to be.

10:33.411 --> 10:36.001
Yours is shorter. I Iike it.

10:36.373 --> 10:38.873
Yeah?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.629
Well, this is Iike old times.

10:43.630 --> 10:46.130
Getting you out of trouble.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.008
We've got a chopper coming
in about an hour,

10:48.009 --> 10:50.719
but until then,
we should stay where we are.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.306
You know, you've got
some very unfriendly people out there.

10:54.307 --> 10:57.267
- Where does this tunnel go?
- Back to the orphanage.

10:57.268 --> 10:59.728
There's a secret entrance.

10:59.729 --> 11:02.606
Yeah, well, secrets have
a funny way of getting out.

11:02.607 --> 11:05.107
Excuse me.

11:07.654 --> 11:10.154
Hi, how you doing?

11:10.281 --> 11:13.200
Like to make a Iittle deal with you.
A Iittle trade, actually.

11:13.201 --> 11:18.205
You give me that ball,
and I'II get you a brand-new one.

11:18.206 --> 11:20.791
But you're gonna have to trust me.
I'm gonna have to owe you.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.292
What do you say?

11:29.217 --> 11:32.678
Yeah? Good man, good man.

11:32.845 --> 11:38.100
Now, I'm gonna need
some empty cans, some fuel,

11:38.267 --> 11:42.063
a noisemaker
and some form of grease.

11:42.230 --> 11:45.774
Animal fat will do.
Open that, will you, Pete?

11:45.775 --> 11:49.236
- What's he doing?
- I haven't got a clue...

11:49.237 --> 11:51.737
...but I'm used to it.

11:57.411 --> 12:01.956
Still doing it, huh?
Making things out of thin air?

12:01.957 --> 12:03.249
What is it this time?

12:03.250 --> 12:08.254
I'm gonna use the string in this ball as
part of our alarm system and a fuse.

12:08.255 --> 12:10.924
A fuse? We don't have
any explosive.

12:10.925 --> 12:14.135
But the guys out there
don't know that.

12:14.136 --> 12:18.126
And what they don't know
can only help us.

12:21.393 --> 12:24.187
But they are women,
and only two of them.

12:24.188 --> 12:27.273
They are Americans.
And they're on the death Iist.

12:27.274 --> 12:28.775
If we Iose such a prize,

12:28.776 --> 12:33.016
provincial headquarters
will have us both shot.

12:33.238 --> 12:35.738
No sign of them?

12:36.492 --> 12:39.410
They haven't been seen
on the border roads.

12:39.411 --> 12:42.622
They wouldn't risk the children's Iives
by going through the jungle.

12:42.623 --> 12:45.123
They must be here.

12:48.796 --> 12:50.963
A lot of people
use electronic sensors

12:50.964 --> 12:54.467
to let them know if they're
about to have uninvited guests.

12:54.468 --> 12:57.603
But there are other ways to do it.

12:57.638 --> 13:01.390
I remember tying a piece of string
between two tin cans.

13:01.391 --> 13:04.936
The idea was if someone talked
into the can at one end,

13:04.937 --> 13:07.897
I could hear what was being said
at the other.

13:07.898 --> 13:10.858
I was kind of hoping
to do the same thing here...

13:10.859 --> 13:12.485
...sort of.

13:12.486 --> 13:15.780
I guess you could call it
simple communication.

13:15.781 --> 13:18.032
If anybody came through this door,

13:18.033 --> 13:22.036
I wanted to get the message
loud and clear on the other end.

13:22.037 --> 13:26.457
Which is more than I ever got
playing Telephone.

13:29.961 --> 13:33.561
- Here you go, Mac.
- Oh, thanks, Pete.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.175
The animal fat in the meat
and some kerosene

13:36.176 --> 13:38.552
is gonna make a great fuse.

13:38.553 --> 13:41.053
Yeah.

13:44.643 --> 13:49.355
So why'd these guys come after you?
What set them off?

13:49.356 --> 13:52.524
The other day, Sister Margaret
saved one of the villagers

13:52.525 --> 13:55.611
from being beaten to death
by Chanthara's soldiers.

13:55.612 --> 13:58.732
She covered the man with her body.

13:58.865 --> 14:01.365
And they stopped.

14:01.409 --> 14:04.077
I guess that did it,
they decided to move against her.

14:04.078 --> 14:06.079
But we heard you were both
on their hit Iist.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.873
Well, you know me.

14:07.874 --> 14:11.376
I've never been one
to sit on the sidelines.

14:11.377 --> 14:13.877
Yeah.

14:16.174 --> 14:19.218
If that moves, we move.

14:45.244 --> 14:47.412
That's it. Let's get everybody
out to the clearing.

14:47.413 --> 14:50.081
- AII right. Children, come quickly.
- Come here.

14:50.082 --> 14:52.582
Come on.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.520
A bomb! Look out!

15:18.777 --> 15:20.945
CIever.

15:20.946 --> 15:23.446
Come on.

15:27.411 --> 15:29.911
This way.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.892
Hold on! Look out!

16:32.893 --> 16:34.560
Debra!

16:34.561 --> 16:36.937
Take off, Pete!

16:36.938 --> 16:38.606
Mac!

16:38.607 --> 16:41.234
- Bulgaria!
- Yes!

16:41.610 --> 16:44.194
- Let's move. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

16:44.195 --> 16:47.845
The man and woman.
Get them. Kill them!

16:56.374 --> 16:59.668
Pete said "Bulgaria."
What did he mean?

16:59.669 --> 17:02.379
That's an arrangement we've got.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.673
He'II be back in the clearing
in eight hours.

17:04.674 --> 17:08.093
If we miss him then,
it'II be 16 hours after that, and so on.

17:08.094 --> 17:11.680
You mean, we've gotta get back
to that clearing at 6:00?

17:11.681 --> 17:13.807
That's the idea.

17:13.808 --> 17:19.738
- But Chanthara's got it blocked off.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.443
Is this thing gonna get us
to the refugee station?

17:24.444 --> 17:28.070
- It's ten miles from the border.
- We took a hit.

17:28.071 --> 17:31.242
Oil pressure's down near zero.

17:31.576 --> 17:36.866
Sister, if you got a direct Iine
upstairs, put in a call.

17:44.922 --> 17:46.882
AII right, hold it.

17:46.883 --> 17:49.801
Now, step backwards into the creek
using the same footprints.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.012
Go ahead.

17:52.013 --> 17:55.599
- What are we doing?
- An old Apache Indian trick.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.518
Can't track anyone through water.

17:58.519 --> 18:00.186
Think it'II work?

18:00.187 --> 18:04.024
Well, it should.
Unless they've seen a Iot of Westerns.

18:04.025 --> 18:06.525
Come on.

18:15.911 --> 18:19.122
There's the refugee camp.
We're gonna make it.

18:19.123 --> 18:21.623
Thank God.

18:23.252 --> 18:25.812
I got no feeling in my Ieg.

18:25.880 --> 18:30.466
Can't work the pedals.
And there's a torque in the tail rudder.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.468
What does that mean?

18:32.469 --> 18:34.596
There's no way
to control the Ianding.

18:34.597 --> 18:39.227
She's Iiable to hit the ground
wherever she wants.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.665
Coming in!
Sister, hold on to those kids!

18:49.987 --> 18:52.487
Hang on!

18:57.995 --> 19:00.706
We need a doctor, a medic!

19:00.873 --> 19:02.832
Hurry, come on.

19:02.833 --> 19:06.043
- Here we go.
- Take cover behind the building!

19:06.044 --> 19:08.504
Everybody out!
She could blow any second.

19:08.505 --> 19:11.005
Come on. Here we go.

19:24.312 --> 19:26.812
Peter!

19:35.240 --> 19:38.827
Peter. Oh, it could have exploded.

19:38.994 --> 19:41.912
Yeah, I know, Maggie,
but we need the chopper.

19:41.913 --> 19:46.166
Without it, we can't get back
to Mac and Debbie.

19:46.167 --> 19:47.751
Are you all right?

19:47.752 --> 19:50.379
Well, our pilot was hit.
He went off with the medic.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.756
Oh, you must be Mr. Thornton.

19:52.757 --> 19:54.633
I am Gilbert Arnaud.

19:54.634 --> 19:57.636
Your foundation told us
to expect you.

19:57.637 --> 19:59.221
Unofficially, of course.

19:59.222 --> 20:02.099
What's a Frenchman doing
running a refugee station out here?

20:02.100 --> 20:06.103
I am a refugee myself,
of the old colonial days.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.614
I will check on your pilot.

20:08.648 --> 20:11.608
And I will be with the children.

20:13.194 --> 20:16.738
- You know, this is all your fault.
- What are you talking about?

20:16.739 --> 20:19.825
You're the one who put me in touch
with Sister Margaret.

20:19.826 --> 20:22.244
Your Ietter caught up with me
in Kenya,

20:22.245 --> 20:23.954
at that game preserve
where I was working.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.581
Now, wait a minute.

20:25.582 --> 20:27.583
Pete said Margaret needed help
in the orphanage,

20:27.584 --> 20:34.584
and I thought the two of you would
hit it off. But I didn't think you'd stay.

20:36.342 --> 20:38.842
Wait.

20:47.103 --> 20:50.689
Our footprints are shallow.
Theirs are deeper.

20:50.690 --> 20:53.233
As if they step in them twice.

20:53.234 --> 20:54.985
They never crossed this creek.

20:54.986 --> 20:56.444
Move.

20:56.445 --> 20:58.945
Go, go, go.

21:08.249 --> 21:11.376
Your pilot's Ieg wound is minor.
He will be fine.

21:11.377 --> 21:14.045
Listen, we Ieft two people behind
when we evacuated back there.

21:14.046 --> 21:16.256
I've gotta return for them by 6:00.

21:16.257 --> 21:19.134
Have you got anybody here who can
fix this chopper in four hours?

21:19.135 --> 21:20.510
Oh, we have no one.

21:20.511 --> 21:23.972
But I know a man at the refugee
station 20 kilometres from here.

21:23.973 --> 21:26.883
- I will call him.
- AII right.

21:34.233 --> 21:36.733
Wait.

21:43.492 --> 21:49.392
One thing I miss about the city,
no empty warehouses to hide in.

21:49.498 --> 21:52.748
AII right, we'II rest for a second.

22:05.264 --> 22:08.183
Come here. PIease?

22:09.685 --> 22:14.975
See if we can make these guys
think we're someplace else.

22:22.364 --> 22:27.159
So you're saying this man
is the only mechanic you have?

22:27.160 --> 22:29.660
I understand.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.710
The mechanic at the other station
has been sent to Bangkok.

22:35.711 --> 22:39.046
- Isn't there anyone else you can call?
- Oh, Sister, please understand.

22:39.047 --> 22:41.667
Our resources are so Iimited.

22:41.716 --> 22:44.385
- We have no people who can just--
- I know. We do have people,

22:44.386 --> 22:47.888
and they're stuck on the other side
of the border, in very serious trouble.

22:47.889 --> 22:50.641
In three and a half hours, they
expect me to come back and get them.

22:50.642 --> 22:53.282
And somehow I'm gonna do it.

22:53.770 --> 22:56.270
I will continue to try.

23:02.529 --> 23:06.469
One more of these saplings
ought to do it.

23:09.661 --> 23:11.578
Grab those vines
on the other side of the Iog.

23:11.579 --> 23:14.809
- Pull them together.
- You got it.

23:14.999 --> 23:18.489
Here's another one.
Give them a yank.

23:18.878 --> 23:21.738
- Is that tight enough?
- Yeah.

23:24.342 --> 23:26.009
The more tension
we put on these vines,

23:26.010 --> 23:30.270
the further away
those guys will think we are.

23:30.390 --> 23:33.190
That ought to hold it for now.

23:33.601 --> 23:36.770
I've never been able to figure out
how your mind works.

23:36.771 --> 23:39.106
How do you think of these things?

23:39.107 --> 23:42.067
Well, if it comes down
to me against a situation,

23:42.068 --> 23:45.238
I don't Iike the situation to win.

23:45.446 --> 23:47.864
How many more rocks do we need?

23:47.865 --> 23:50.617
These ought to be enough
to get their attention.

23:50.618 --> 23:55.058
They should fly about 100 feet
if we're Iucky.

23:56.874 --> 24:00.127
There. Now, we're gonna need
some kind of time-delay fuse.

24:00.128 --> 24:02.587
Do you have anything
that will refract Iight?

24:02.588 --> 24:04.798
A crystal? A prism of some kind?

24:04.799 --> 24:06.967
We could try my rosary.

24:06.968 --> 24:09.302
Sister Margaret gave it to me,

24:09.303 --> 24:12.743
but seeing as this
is an emergency...

24:13.224 --> 24:15.724
It's perfect.

24:21.399 --> 24:23.358
Gotta make sure this coil
is wide enough

24:23.359 --> 24:26.903
so it'II catch the sun
before it changes position,

24:26.904 --> 24:29.864
be in the right spot
for a few minutes.

24:29.865 --> 24:33.515
So the Iight
will go through the beads.

24:33.661 --> 24:37.971
Right, and it'II be focused
on our small vine.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.499
Kind of Iike a solar fuse.

24:56.350 --> 24:58.850
We'd better go.

25:08.529 --> 25:10.113
Three-thirty.

25:10.114 --> 25:14.714
Two and a half hours
to get back to the clearing.

25:14.868 --> 25:16.702
Bad Iuck, I'm afraid, mes amis.

25:16.703 --> 25:20.873
There is not a qualified mechanic
within 200 kilometres.

25:20.874 --> 25:23.042
How far across the border
are your friends?

25:23.043 --> 25:25.419
Our orphanage is near
the village of Sonh Pra.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.922
What about that old truck over there?
Would that get us there?

25:27.923 --> 25:29.590
Oh, it is too dangerous.

25:29.591 --> 25:32.802
It is too far. And besides,
that truck has not run in months.

25:32.803 --> 25:37.803
That, as you Americans say,
is the Iine at the bottom.

25:39.810 --> 25:41.894
Well...

25:41.895 --> 25:44.146
...I guess we'II have to fix
the chopper ourselves.

25:44.147 --> 25:46.148
What?

25:46.149 --> 25:50.569
Maggie, how in the sam hill
are we gonna do that?

25:50.570 --> 25:55.199
I'm good with broken-down machinery.
It's the only kind I've ever had.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.328
Besides, what else is there to do?

26:20.266 --> 26:22.766
Over there!

26:25.730 --> 26:27.314
Rocks.

26:27.315 --> 26:29.107
Don't you see what he's doing?

26:29.108 --> 26:33.654
If rocks are Ianding around us,
they had to be thrown from there.

26:33.655 --> 26:35.113
Move out!

26:35.114 --> 26:38.844
Come on. Come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry.

26:40.536 --> 26:43.036
Rosary beads.

26:44.791 --> 26:46.875
This man is quite ingenious.

26:46.876 --> 26:48.960
He wants us to think
he's going away from the bushes

26:48.961 --> 26:52.214
where the rocks Ianded.
But he's going toward them.

26:52.215 --> 26:54.508
You, go to the creek.
Watch for them.

26:54.509 --> 26:58.189
You, circle around.
The rest, follow me.

27:02.391 --> 27:04.726
You said he'd do that.

27:04.727 --> 27:07.227
Yeah.

27:07.480 --> 27:14.410
But something tells me this guy's got
brains he hasn't even started to use.

27:17.323 --> 27:19.824
AII right, it's 4:15.
If they keep moving,

27:19.825 --> 27:22.953
we may have bought ourselves enough
time to get back to the clearing.

27:22.954 --> 27:25.454
Let's go.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.459
MacGyver,

27:29.460 --> 27:32.212
if you weren't here right now,
where would you be?

27:32.213 --> 27:36.341
Well, the big camel races
are in Morocco this time of year.

27:36.342 --> 27:38.009
Come on.

27:38.010 --> 27:40.510
Skating with the Rangers?

27:40.513 --> 27:42.847
I'm serious.

27:42.848 --> 27:45.348
AII right. Come here.

27:47.686 --> 27:49.812
We really had something.

27:49.813 --> 27:52.313
I wanna know why you Ieft.

27:54.068 --> 27:57.153
You were gonna ask me
to get married.

27:57.154 --> 28:00.032
- You knew that?
- Yeah.

28:00.366 --> 28:04.452
Well, if you knew I was gonna ask you,
why didn't you say something?

28:04.453 --> 28:06.953
I don't know. I...

28:07.331 --> 28:10.501
I just wasn't ready to be married.

28:14.588 --> 28:17.132
It was bad timing, Mac.

28:17.299 --> 28:20.659
- Neither of us were ready.
- I was.

28:20.719 --> 28:23.972
That was eight years ago.

28:24.306 --> 28:27.892
- We're not the same people anymore.
- Sure we are.

28:27.893 --> 28:30.144
I still Iike hockey.

28:30.145 --> 28:32.645
And I'II just bet...

28:32.689 --> 28:38.235
...that you still Iike pickles
dipped in cream cheese, don't you?

28:38.236 --> 28:42.908
I thought I had stopped
thinking about you.

28:43.116 --> 28:45.616
I was so wrong.

29:03.595 --> 29:06.389
- I can't do this.
- What?

29:06.556 --> 29:11.936
If they hadn't come after us,
I'd be getting ready to take my vows.

29:11.937 --> 29:13.687
Your vows? What do you mean?

29:13.688 --> 29:16.188
I'm going to be a nun.

29:29.954 --> 29:32.594
We'd better get out of here.

29:50.308 --> 29:53.538
- I heard gunfire.
- Yes. This way.

29:58.107 --> 30:00.942
This is too small.
Give me the three-eighths.

30:00.943 --> 30:03.987
What did you wrap
around that hose?

30:03.988 --> 30:07.825
Oh, an Ace bandage
from the medical kit.

30:08.326 --> 30:09.659
Screwdriver.

30:09.660 --> 30:13.600
Well, I figured
that's what Mac would use.

30:14.665 --> 30:19.169
You know, I wasn't surprised
when I saw you there today.

30:19.170 --> 30:22.339
You always seem to show up
when I need you most.

30:22.340 --> 30:24.049
Yeah.

30:24.050 --> 30:26.676
Funny how we keep
bumping into each other, isn't it?

30:26.677 --> 30:29.177
Every six or eight years.

30:38.147 --> 30:40.356
AII right, Iet's get the pilot

30:40.357 --> 30:43.985
and see if we can get this thing
off the ground.

30:43.986 --> 30:46.486
Come here.

30:53.996 --> 30:56.496
Look.

30:59.001 --> 31:01.671
How did they figure that out?

31:02.421 --> 31:05.831
Maybe he has seen
a Iot of Westerns.

31:06.175 --> 31:09.178
Come on. We gotta go.

31:14.058 --> 31:16.727
Come on. Come on.

31:16.894 --> 31:18.394
The igniter's missing.

31:18.395 --> 31:20.855
Engine won't fire up the fuel
without it.

31:20.856 --> 31:23.356
It was there before.

31:23.442 --> 31:25.860
- Wasn't it?
- It sure was.

31:25.861 --> 31:28.361
Well, it's gone now.

31:38.373 --> 31:39.999
He'II be here.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.900
Let's just keep moving around
the edge of the clearing. Come on.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.846
Halt!

31:58.143 --> 32:02.396
I'm proud to have had
such worthy adversaries.

32:02.397 --> 32:06.417
I almost regret that this game
is now over.

32:14.784 --> 32:17.077
How did they know
we'd be at the clearing?

32:17.078 --> 32:19.872
Kind of curious about that myself.

32:19.873 --> 32:21.874
What do you think they'II do?

32:21.875 --> 32:25.919
Well, they could give us
a Iift to the border...

32:25.920 --> 32:28.720
...but I wouldn't count on it.

32:28.798 --> 32:31.298
Oh, yeah.

32:32.635 --> 32:36.930
They must be using the orphanage
as a headquarters or something.

32:36.931 --> 32:39.891
This used to be the old kitchen.

32:55.116 --> 32:56.992
These are your crimes.

32:56.993 --> 33:00.162
It's important the people know you're
not being punished without cause.

33:00.163 --> 33:02.993
Hey, you spelled my name wrong.

33:05.251 --> 33:08.795
It is a shame to waste
your sense of humour on me alone.

33:08.796 --> 33:10.422
But tomorrow at high noon,

33:10.423 --> 33:15.273
the entire village can witness
your final performance.

33:19.015 --> 33:21.515
MacGyver.

33:21.642 --> 33:23.852
"High noon"?

33:23.853 --> 33:26.973
This guy's seen too many Westerns.

33:29.066 --> 33:32.360
You know, there is something
very wrong with this whole place.

33:32.361 --> 33:35.363
Well, we now have
till 10 tomorrow morning

33:35.364 --> 33:37.532
to find that igniter
and get back to MacGyver.

33:37.533 --> 33:40.076
I'II start Iooking in that supply area
by the chopper pad, okay?

33:40.077 --> 33:43.038
Thanks a Iot, Jimmy. Maggie, why
don't you Iook in the kids' barracks.

33:43.039 --> 33:45.373
Whoever stole the thing
would never think we'd Iook there.

33:45.374 --> 33:48.001
I'II go check the buildings
by the gate.

33:48.002 --> 33:50.502
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.133
What are you doing now?

33:55.134 --> 33:58.303
Well, the chimney's not big enough
for us to get out.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.722
We're not gonna make it, are we?

34:00.723 --> 34:03.224
What happened to all that faith?

34:03.225 --> 34:05.310
I'm just a novice, remember?

34:05.311 --> 34:06.936
Not with those kids, you're not.

34:06.937 --> 34:13.444
At the convent they taught us
that wanting things, needing people...

34:13.610 --> 34:16.946
...get in the way
of our serving God.

34:16.947 --> 34:20.659
I want to serve him, but now...

34:21.493 --> 34:25.080
- Now what?
- Everything was set, Mac.

34:25.246 --> 34:28.791
I knew exactly what I wanted to do
with my Iife.

34:28.792 --> 34:31.418
And now it is all upside-down.

34:31.420 --> 34:36.132
I keep thinking that--
That maybe I want children of my own.

34:36.132 --> 34:39.703
They tend to frown
on nuns doing that.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.304
And...

34:42.306 --> 34:49.056
...there are other feelings that
I thought I'd trained myself not to have.

34:50.938 --> 34:52.231
What difference does it make?

34:52.232 --> 34:54.108
We're not gonna
get out of here anyway.

34:54.109 --> 34:56.609
Yes, we are.

34:58.822 --> 35:01.323
And then you're gonna have
to decide what you really want.

35:01.324 --> 35:03.242
I did decide.

35:03.243 --> 35:05.119
I just didn't figure
on you showing up.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.110
- That's no decision.
- Oh, Mac.

35:08.123 --> 35:11.323
- I've gotta think.
- Don't think.

35:12.586 --> 35:15.004
Feel.

35:15.005 --> 35:16.630
It would never work with us.

35:16.631 --> 35:18.090
- Why not?
- It just wouldn't.

35:18.091 --> 35:20.301
- Give me a reason.
- You're always moving around.

35:20.302 --> 35:23.721
- You never stay in one place.
- I wasn't the one who Ieft, remember?

35:23.722 --> 35:26.307
That was eight years ago.
I've changed.

35:26.308 --> 35:28.808
So would I...

35:29.060 --> 35:31.395
...for you.

35:31.396 --> 35:35.065
I never thought
I'd hear that from you.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.626
I never thought I'd say it.

35:52.917 --> 35:56.337
Oh, my God. Guard! PIease help!

36:10.977 --> 36:13.228
Nice hit.

36:13.229 --> 36:17.039
The Tigers could have
used you this year.

36:20.361 --> 36:22.861
Hey, it's getting Iight.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.614
Now we count on Pete.

37:03.404 --> 37:05.780
Well, Iook at this.

37:05.781 --> 37:08.281
The igniter.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.478
Patch me through
to Captain Chanthara.

37:37.479 --> 37:39.979
This is Gilbert Arnaud.

37:40.941 --> 37:44.443
Chanthara? The American, Thornton,
is planning another rescue.

37:44.444 --> 37:47.613
At the same clearing,
at 10:00 this morning.

37:47.614 --> 37:49.657
I heard him talking to the nun.

37:49.658 --> 37:53.536
No, no, no. The helicopter
has been sabotaged, but--

37:53.537 --> 37:54.912
You have captured them?

37:54.913 --> 37:57.957
Well, then you have accomplished
your mission, but with my help.

37:57.958 --> 38:00.626
So you will now send me my money.

38:00.627 --> 38:03.127
Merci, captain.

38:13.765 --> 38:16.265
Looking for this?

38:27.320 --> 38:29.906
Well, mon ami,

38:30.073 --> 38:34.063
we'II just see
that you don't go anywhere.

38:35.078 --> 38:37.664
Or make a peep.

38:43.336 --> 38:46.672
But they've been captured.
You heard what Arnaud said.

38:46.673 --> 38:49.049
I know, Maggie, but I've got
an agreement with Mac.

38:49.050 --> 38:51.385
Now, I stood him up before.
I'm not gonna do that again.

38:51.386 --> 38:53.178
The rest is up to him.

38:53.179 --> 38:56.265
Nine-twenty.
Now, that gives me 40 minutes.

38:56.266 --> 38:59.810
- I'm going too.
- Maggie, you're not going.

38:59.811 --> 39:04.189
Listen, if anything should happen,
those kids need you.

39:04.190 --> 39:08.527
Maggie, if anything does happen,
I want to say something.

39:08.528 --> 39:11.530
If things had been different for us...

39:11.531 --> 39:15.575
...we really would have been
something special.

39:15.576 --> 39:20.205
In fact, if I had it to do over again,
there's a Iot of things I'd change.

39:20.206 --> 39:22.082
No.

39:22.083 --> 39:25.001
You'd have done everything
just the same.

39:25.002 --> 39:27.502
And so would I.

39:27.713 --> 39:31.333
But it's Iovely that you feel that way.

39:34.428 --> 39:37.518
AII right, Iet's get out of here!

39:58.953 --> 40:01.453
What happened?

40:04.917 --> 40:07.418
The Americans have gone
to the clearing. AIert the men.

40:07.419 --> 40:09.919
Yes, sir.

40:20.557 --> 40:23.057
That was easy.

40:24.436 --> 40:26.936
I still--

40:29.274 --> 40:32.193
I still don't understand
why you wanted to stay here.

40:32.194 --> 40:34.112
Well, chances are,
Chanthara would catch us

40:34.113 --> 40:35.988
if we went back to the clearing.

40:35.989 --> 40:38.866
But if we don't go,
Pete will never find us.

40:38.867 --> 40:41.452
Well, then it's up to us
to Iet him know where we are.

40:41.453 --> 40:45.603
And we're gonna do that
with a Iittle flare.

40:46.458 --> 40:48.042
Chanthara took my knife.

40:48.043 --> 40:50.586
Belt buckle's
the sharpest thing I've got.

40:50.587 --> 40:55.027
Gonna cut off some of this wire
and make a saw.

40:55.509 --> 40:59.819
And this bamboo Ieg here
is just what we need.

41:04.309 --> 41:06.937
I'm not following this plan.

41:07.104 --> 41:09.897
How's a piece of bamboo
gonna help us?

41:09.898 --> 41:12.938
It's got a natural sealed cavity.

41:16.154 --> 41:18.280
No sign of MacGyver anywhere.

41:18.281 --> 41:21.200
How much time before
they're supposed to show up?

41:21.201 --> 41:23.701
Seven minutes.

41:32.837 --> 41:35.340
Good. Hang on to that.

41:40.011 --> 41:42.680
- What's that stuff?
- Oh, it's just plain old fertilizer,

41:42.681 --> 41:45.808
but it's got some chemicals in it
called nitrates.

41:45.809 --> 41:48.853
And they pack a pretty good zip.

42:03.701 --> 42:07.671
Wanna hand me
that wooden spoon back there?

42:16.255 --> 42:18.048
Great.

42:18.049 --> 42:23.529
Hold that right there.
This will give it a Iittle stability.

42:25.098 --> 42:27.975
- It's a rocket.
- Yeah.

42:28.976 --> 42:35.116
Hopefully, in about ten minutes,
we'II have our own Fourth of July.

42:39.654 --> 42:43.224
They must be here.
That is their plan.

42:43.658 --> 42:46.158
Take cover.

42:46.619 --> 42:51.089
And this funnel ought to make
a great nose cone.

42:52.416 --> 42:54.250
- What do you think?
- Nice touch.

42:54.251 --> 42:56.751
Thanks.

43:11.602 --> 43:13.436
Arnaud was Iying.

43:13.437 --> 43:15.937
Fire on them.

43:18.734 --> 43:22.445
I can't stay this Iow.
Ground fire will bring us down.

43:22.446 --> 43:24.614
I can't see Mac.

43:24.615 --> 43:27.368
I can't see anything.

43:30.454 --> 43:32.954
There he is.

43:44.009 --> 43:46.509
Jimmy! Up ahead!

43:46.553 --> 43:48.095
Near the orphanage.

43:48.096 --> 43:51.406
- The flare, it's MacGyver.
- Right.

44:44.152 --> 44:45.653
I know I don't have to say this,

44:45.654 --> 44:47.780
- but hang on.
- Okay.

44:47.781 --> 44:50.281
Up! Take him up!

45:13.348 --> 45:16.658
- You all right?
- Yeah. Just great.

45:25.568 --> 45:28.445
The Thai authorities
took Arnaud into custody.

45:28.446 --> 45:30.280
Margaret's gonna stay here
and run this place

45:30.281 --> 45:33.408
until they bring up
a new administrator from Bangkok.

45:33.409 --> 45:35.909
Well, that's great, Pete.

45:36.621 --> 45:39.121
Excuse me.

45:46.088 --> 45:47.464
Howdy.

45:47.465 --> 45:50.926
Listen, I know I'm a day Iate,
but I wanna thank you for trusting me.

45:50.927 --> 45:52.969
I owe you a new ball.

45:52.970 --> 45:55.690
And you got any use for that?

46:06.859 --> 46:08.568
Listen, I...

46:08.569 --> 46:10.779
I booked you a seat
on the plane tomorrow.

46:10.780 --> 46:14.199
You said I'd have to decide
what I really wanted.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.367
I have.

46:16.368 --> 46:18.411
Are you sure?

46:18.412 --> 46:22.112
I've made a commitment.
Yeah, I'm sure.

46:28.714 --> 46:31.214
You'II always be with me.

46:43.145 --> 46:45.645
Well, Maggie,

46:45.647 --> 46:49.984
I guess I'II see you
next time you're in trouble, huh?

46:49.985 --> 46:52.785
I'II be Iooking forward to it.

46:53.071 --> 46:55.571
Yeah.

46:55.908 --> 46:58.408
Me too.

47:11.590 --> 47:14.175
I'II never meet anyone Iike her.

47:14.176 --> 47:16.766
I know exactly how you feel.
