00:00.071 --> 00:01.355
Oh...

00:01.441 --> 00:04.784
Okay, if you think you've
lived through a bad day,

00:04.869 --> 00:06.790
try being our next guest.

00:06.875 --> 00:09.485
When she showed up to a
screening of her new film,

00:09.570 --> 00:11.618
"The Crows Have Eyes:
The Crowening..."

00:11.702 --> 00:13.900
- Fun name!
- It is!

00:14.265 --> 00:18.190
So, the last thing she expected
was an actual crow attack!

00:19.397 --> 00:20.921
Oh...

00:22.152 --> 00:24.562
Well, now we're being told
that the whole thing

00:24.647 --> 00:27.479
was a PR stunt
put out by the movie.

00:27.564 --> 00:29.482
Now, is that clever or what?

00:29.613 --> 00:32.205
It sure is!
We are so very lucky

00:32.308 --> 00:34.978
to be joined this morning
by Moira Rose.

00:35.063 --> 00:36.273
- Well, ach!
- Ach!

00:36.358 --> 00:38.799
- What a ride this has been!
- Yes.

00:38.934 --> 00:40.982
What a ride indeed, Barb!

00:41.391 --> 00:43.225
Oh, let me first assure
your viewers

00:43.310 --> 00:46.069
that... not a single crow
was harmed,

00:46.161 --> 00:47.261
and as for the humans,

00:47.346 --> 00:49.779
oh, nothing but a little
wounded pride...

00:49.985 --> 00:51.812
and one severed earlobe.

00:51.897 --> 00:53.474
- Oh!
- Ouch!

00:53.559 --> 00:55.620
- Yeah!
- Yes, everything you saw

00:55.705 --> 00:57.509
was part of a carefully
orchestrated,

00:57.594 --> 00:59.729
entirely deliberate stunt.

00:59.814 --> 01:02.368
Oh, well, it seems
to have worked, Moira.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.988
With over more than
2 million views

01:05.072 --> 01:07.165
in less than 24 hours,

01:07.282 --> 01:10.901
this video has created an
incredible buzz for the movie,

01:10.986 --> 01:13.245
which, as of right now,

01:13.329 --> 01:16.461
is officially trending
on Interflix.

01:16.546 --> 01:17.688
It is?!

01:18.348 --> 01:20.353
Well, if you're saying
it's a smash hit,

01:20.438 --> 01:23.292
then I'm just going to have
to take your word for it.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.431
As well as the word
of millions of streamers

01:25.515 --> 01:27.520
across the internet, I suppose.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.927
You know, the brilliant thing
about being on streaming

01:30.012 --> 01:32.826
is that one can start
the movie at any point,

01:32.911 --> 01:34.436
any time they like.

01:34.521 --> 01:36.962
You know, Moira,
I think it's safe to say

01:37.062 --> 01:38.531
you are officially back

01:38.616 --> 01:40.335
- in the game! -
- Yes!

01:40.420 --> 01:42.154
Well, you heard it here
first!

01:42.239 --> 01:44.227
Do not adjust your sets!

01:45.492 --> 01:46.881
Excuse me, but I'd be remiss

01:46.966 --> 01:50.328
if I didn't acknowledge
my daughter, Alexis Rose.

01:51.677 --> 01:55.497
This whole PR coup d'état never
would've happened without her.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.119
Honestly, we just had fun
with it.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.232
Can't hear you.

01:58.317 --> 01:59.758
Poor dear's not mic'd.

01:59.843 --> 02:02.249
Well, looks like
there's no stopping you two now!

02:02.334 --> 02:03.990
Congratulations!
Hmhm.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.999
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

02:13.918 --> 02:16.097
Gentlemen. Morning.

02:16.182 --> 02:19.133
I believe you've met
my roommate, Bob.

02:19.218 --> 02:21.295
- Roommate?
- Mm-hmm.

02:21.877 --> 02:23.362
Yeah.
Uh, Ronnie's been nice enough

02:23.446 --> 02:24.929
to let me stay in her
guest room,

02:25.014 --> 02:26.593
ever since Gwen...

02:28.007 --> 02:29.095
took the house.

02:29.222 --> 02:32.853
Yeah. And as much as I'm
enjoying the slumber party,

02:32.980 --> 02:35.929
I really think that Bob could
use a change of scenery.

02:36.014 --> 02:38.293
Maybe he could crash here
for a night...

02:38.580 --> 02:39.903
or six?

02:40.162 --> 02:42.394
- Uh, yeah...
- I don't think we, uh,

02:42.479 --> 02:44.913
we have any clean rooms
available.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.388
Oh, I... I don't mind
a dirty room.

02:47.473 --> 02:50.936
I hope that doesn't sound
as sad as...

02:51.102 --> 02:52.698
as it feels.

02:52.858 --> 02:55.155
Bob, why,
why don't you take a seat?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.568
And grab some water
while you're at it,

02:57.653 --> 03:01.051
'cause you should really
hydrate after all that crying.

03:01.206 --> 03:03.472
Gwen used to love water.

03:11.037 --> 03:13.067
Okay, I feel badly for Bob,

03:13.151 --> 03:14.492
but it's not a good look

03:14.577 --> 03:16.644
to have him wallowing
around here.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.594
Well, where do you
want the guy to wallow?

03:18.678 --> 03:21.206
I mean, Johnny,
there's plenty of sad people

03:21.290 --> 03:22.659
staying at this motel.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.951
That's not exactly how I'd
describe our guests, Roland.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.734
Well, I'm just saying,
maybe he could meet

03:27.818 --> 03:29.572
a fellow wallower here?

03:29.657 --> 03:32.084
Oh, it'd be really nice
if Bob could meet somebody

03:32.169 --> 03:33.083
'cause from what I hear,

03:33.168 --> 03:35.340
Gwen isn't exactly sitting
at home.

03:35.469 --> 03:37.213
Or, what if...

03:37.700 --> 03:40.495
we take Bob out for the evening

03:40.945 --> 03:43.022
and kind of act
as his wingmen

03:43.333 --> 03:45.431
Johnny, you know,
the whole dating scene

03:45.516 --> 03:47.773
has kind of changed a little
since you were single.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.127
First off,
we now have electricity.

03:52.269 --> 03:54.923
Okay, all right,
are you in or not?

03:55.008 --> 03:57.241
Ooh, I'm in. 'Cause I don't
wanna miss a chance

03:57.326 --> 03:59.241
to see how this plays out.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.644
- Bob?
- Well, it... it would be so nice

04:02.729 --> 04:07.207
to not be completely alone
for a night.

04:07.292 --> 04:08.731
Uh, lucky Gwen,

04:08.816 --> 04:11.489
she has another one of her
male cousins visiting.

04:16.528 --> 04:18.457
- This coffee's delicious.
- Thank you.

04:18.541 --> 04:20.786
Yeah, it's... it's sort of
burning my hand a bit

04:20.870 --> 04:23.257
because I can't put it down
on anything.

04:23.342 --> 04:25.927
David, you know that the new
coffee table is coming today,

04:26.012 --> 04:27.825
and that it takes a little bit
longer

04:27.910 --> 04:29.604
- when it's handmade.
- Handmade, yeah.

04:29.689 --> 04:31.104
You know what I think
you should do?

04:31.189 --> 04:32.789
Just come over here
and relax for a bit.

04:32.874 --> 04:34.672
Sit down, we could put our...

04:34.757 --> 04:36.233
our feet up on the...

04:37.270 --> 04:38.708
You happy now?

04:38.845 --> 04:40.224
Just do me a favour
and watch these,

04:40.308 --> 04:42.845
- and don't eat them.
- Mm. No guarantees.

04:44.538 --> 04:45.564
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:45.649 --> 04:47.790
- Coffee table for Patrick?
- That's me, yeah.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.187
You look super familiar.

04:49.272 --> 04:50.507
Have we ordered
from you before?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.928
Uh, I don't know.
I... I get a lot of orders.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.885
- Do you mind if I uh...?
- Yeah, come on in.

04:54.969 --> 04:58.062
- Uh, it's just right there.
- Yeah.

04:58.388 --> 04:59.903
'Kay.

05:04.426 --> 05:07.415
I'm sorry, this is who made
your table?

05:07.500 --> 05:08.638
- David!
- Hi.

05:08.723 --> 05:10.721
- What're you doing here?
- Okay. Muah.

05:10.806 --> 05:12.254
Wow.
We're still doing that.

05:12.577 --> 05:15.113
Uh, this is my boyfriend's
place.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.303
- Fiancé.
- Fiancé.

05:16.388 --> 05:19.165
Yeah. Now I remember where
we met before.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.489
- Stevie's apartment.
- At Stevie's.

05:20.573 --> 05:23.106
Bingo. I'm sorry
for not remembering.

05:23.191 --> 05:24.716
- I meet a lot of people.
- Mm.

05:24.859 --> 05:26.800
That is a great sweater,
by the way.

05:26.939 --> 05:28.903
- It really brings out your lips.
- Okay.

05:29.102 --> 05:32.590
Well, thank you
for the coffee table.

05:32.675 --> 05:33.949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.218
I am also wearing
a sweater.

05:36.424 --> 05:38.692
A lot of sweat
went into this one.

05:39.847 --> 05:42.782
- This is one of my best pieces.
- You got great taste.

05:42.980 --> 05:44.611
And from the looks of it,
so does David.

05:45.188 --> 05:46.946
Okay.
I'm gonna go uh...

05:47.031 --> 05:47.890
you know,
I'm gonna check on the...

05:47.975 --> 05:49.184
- Perfect! Yeah.
- Pancakes.

05:49.269 --> 05:51.903
Say, you know what?
I was just planning on having

05:51.988 --> 05:53.873
a chill night in,
but if you guys are free,

05:53.958 --> 05:55.825
I'd love for you to come by
for a whiskey or...

05:55.910 --> 05:58.387
- Hm. O-kay.
- Whatever.

05:58.495 --> 05:59.681
You know...

06:00.005 --> 06:02.128
You know what? We'll,
we'll think about that for a sec

06:02.213 --> 06:03.937
- and see, and see.
- Great!

06:04.127 --> 06:06.115
- Hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.728
And for what it's worth,

06:08.078 --> 06:09.807
you guys make a beautiful
couple.

06:09.892 --> 06:11.248
Thank you so much.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.051
- What?
- No, you're just, your face

06:20.146 --> 06:21.692
is all red.
It's beet red.

06:21.777 --> 06:23.736
- It is not!
- Mm-hmm. It's flush.

06:25.558 --> 06:27.476
- Hey, babe!
- Hey, babe!

06:27.560 --> 06:29.433
Oh my God! Where are you?
Is that the ocean?

06:29.518 --> 06:32.168
I wish. It's a poster
of the ocean.

06:32.253 --> 06:34.432
'Cause I'm actually in
Stewart's dorm room right now

06:34.517 --> 06:36.806
because mine got evacuated
last night...

06:36.909 --> 06:39.159
small fire ants issue.

06:39.244 --> 06:41.336
Yikes!
Hope everything's okay.

06:41.421 --> 06:44.357
It was a real "Fyre Fest."

06:44.746 --> 06:47.412
You do not wanna see
Krista's ankles today.

06:47.618 --> 06:49.036
<i>But, it's all good.</i>

06:49.121 --> 06:50.507
<i>We'll be getting our dorms
back in...</i>

06:50.591 --> 06:51.979
<i>better shape than
we left 'em.</i>

06:52.063 --> 06:54.142
- <i>Can't wait. Hm.</i>
- Let's talk about you!

06:54.227 --> 06:55.984
<i>Everyone here has been watching
your video!</i>

06:56.096 --> 06:57.463
<i>And to think
it was all fake?</i>

06:57.580 --> 07:00.492
Totally fake.
Isn't that wild?

07:00.585 --> 07:03.115
And all of these PR agencies
from New York are calling

07:03.200 --> 07:04.358
to ask me
how I did it.

07:04.443 --> 07:05.773
How did you do it?

07:05.858 --> 07:07.863
Um, it's like a little bit
too complicated

07:07.948 --> 07:10.258
- to explain over this.
- Hi, Theodore!

07:10.342 --> 07:11.708
Gorgeous view!

07:11.793 --> 07:13.639
Hi, Mrs. Rose!
Congrats on the movie!

07:13.724 --> 07:16.167
That last scene where you
leap from your nest

07:16.252 --> 07:17.635
only to discover that
your wings

07:17.720 --> 07:20.311
- aren't developed enough yet...
- Oh, you're too kind.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.870
The Daily Mail called it
a "flap for the ages!"

07:22.962 --> 07:24.897
Okay, can I have my boyfriend
back now, please?

07:24.982 --> 07:26.203
Hm.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.867
Oh!

07:28.209 --> 07:30.191
It's Buzzfeed calling
about the 10 goriest

07:30.276 --> 07:32.049
Clara Mandrake accidents
from the film.

07:32.134 --> 07:33.699
Best we take it.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.702
And don't forget,
we have a conference call

07:35.787 --> 07:38.747
with the Interflix PR people
in a tight 15.

07:38.832 --> 07:39.809
- Okay.
- <i>Wow,</i>

07:39.893 --> 07:41.494
it seems like you've got
a lot going on, Alexis.

07:41.578 --> 07:43.345
Yes, but not too much
for you.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.784
No,
don't worry about me,

07:44.869 --> 07:47.056
you're obviously in high
demand.

07:47.469 --> 07:48.718
Alexis! They're asking
about co-stars.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.547
I can't be expected to remember
everyone I meet!

07:51.632 --> 07:54.160
Mm. Okay, okay.
Well, I guess I do have to go,

07:54.245 --> 07:55.423
but I will see you
in a few days

07:55.507 --> 07:56.549
and I can't wait!

07:56.634 --> 07:58.417
- I can't wait either.
- Alexis!

07:58.501 --> 07:59.940
Okay, I'm coming.
Ugh!

08:00.035 --> 08:01.606
- Okay, love you!
- Love you...

08:01.690 --> 08:03.246
Ooh!

08:07.971 --> 08:10.063
I don't think we're the same
size, Johnny.

08:10.373 --> 08:13.379
I might have a trouble fitting
tissues into these pockets.

08:13.464 --> 08:14.937
Oh, you won't need tissues.

08:15.022 --> 08:16.498
There'll be no crying tonight,
Bob.

08:16.582 --> 08:18.448
You look like
a million bucks.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.681
Well, actually, Bob,
in Johnny's suit there,

08:20.766 --> 08:22.515
you look like a guy
who had a million bucks,

08:24.411 --> 08:25.602
Very funny, Roland.

08:25.765 --> 08:27.379
Now,
the suit works, Bob.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.269
Bob, in my experience,

08:30.354 --> 08:32.384
it doesn't matter
what you wear.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.515
It's all about being yourself.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.909
I think the last person

08:35.993 --> 08:37.736
Bob wants to be right now
is himself.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.110
I agree with Roland.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.558
I don't know if I can speak
on behalf of women here...

08:41.643 --> 08:42.839
You can't.

08:42.924 --> 08:45.266
Moira used to say,
when she was single,

08:45.350 --> 08:47.050
she would always be attracted
to men

08:47.134 --> 08:48.922
who could make her laugh.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.539
How'd she end up
with you?

08:51.856 --> 08:54.143
All right, why don't we try
a little test run here.

08:54.228 --> 08:56.856
Let's imagine
we're in a bar.

08:56.941 --> 08:59.454
Ronnie, do you wanna be the
woman in this little scenario?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.554
- Not a chance.
- Okay. Mm!

09:02.638 --> 09:05.416
Move over. I...
will be the woman.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.201
Okay.
So we're in a bar

09:07.285 --> 09:10.422
and, uh, you see this very
intriguing looking gentleman.

09:10.661 --> 09:12.407
Okay.

09:12.879 --> 09:14.881
Hello, I'm...

09:15.388 --> 09:16.914
- I'm Gwen.
- Oh...

09:17.178 --> 09:18.821
- You had to pick Gwen?
- I'm sorry,

09:18.905 --> 09:20.404
I saw Bob standing there

09:20.489 --> 09:22.044
and that was the first name
I thought of.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.345
- They're always together.
- Okay. Hold it together.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.946
- Pick another name!
- Okay, all right.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.424
Uh... okay, yeah.

09:29.199 --> 09:31.733
Hi. I'm Ronnie.

09:31.874 --> 09:33.403
- That's my friend Gwen.
- Oh...

09:33.488 --> 09:35.160
Okay, this is a disaster.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.209
Thank you, Roland.
I'll take over from here.

09:37.294 --> 09:38.825
Bob, honestly,

09:38.910 --> 09:40.610
You know,
just a few runs and...

09:40.934 --> 09:43.021
you're gonna be drowning
in phone numbers.

09:43.106 --> 09:45.212
No. No...

09:45.989 --> 09:48.319
I... I can't breathe.

09:48.591 --> 09:50.331
Ooh.

09:52.198 --> 09:54.960
You know what?
Jake did a great job with this.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.796
Mm-hmm.
I was just about to say

09:56.888 --> 09:59.440
this coffee table really
brings out your lips.

09:59.735 --> 10:01.462
Okay, what? I can't
compliment the guy?

10:01.547 --> 10:04.361
He's talented. You know, he's
like a, a one-man operation.

10:04.446 --> 10:05.942
Not in my experience.

10:06.027 --> 10:07.609
And I think it was
very nice of him

10:07.693 --> 10:09.176
to invite us
for drinks tonight.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.265
- Wasn't it?
- Yes, it was. It was very nice

10:11.349 --> 10:12.892
and I think that we should
get back to him about it.

10:12.976 --> 10:16.182
About going to his place
for "a whiskey or whatever"?

10:16.267 --> 10:17.967
David, I'm fine to have
drinks

10:18.051 --> 10:20.274
- with one of your exes, okay?
- Okay, first of all,

10:20.358 --> 10:22.777
Jake is nobody's ex
and everybody's ex.

10:22.862 --> 10:25.661
And second of all,
going to Jake's for a drink

10:25.746 --> 10:28.500
is never just going
to Jake's for a drink.

10:28.585 --> 10:30.531
Oh... oh. So you...

10:30.895 --> 10:33.505
okay, so you think he invited
us over to... to...?

10:33.589 --> 10:36.054
- Yes, I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:36.139 --> 10:37.923
Well, in that case,
we definitely shouldn't go.

10:38.007 --> 10:40.199
'Cause we're not really
the kind of couple that...

10:40.294 --> 10:42.226
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah...

10:42.606 --> 10:44.516
That being said,

10:44.752 --> 10:46.471
if we ever did decide to...

10:48.105 --> 10:50.391
have "a whiskey" with someone,

10:50.622 --> 10:52.769
Jake would be the person
to do that with

10:52.854 --> 10:55.294
because he literally doesn't
care about anything.

10:55.431 --> 10:56.859
So just...

10:56.970 --> 10:59.322
I'm just throwing it out there.

11:00.194 --> 11:02.414
I mean, we always have
the option of going

11:02.499 --> 11:04.669
and just having a whiskey.

11:04.804 --> 11:07.404
Okay. And I always have
the option of online shopping

11:07.489 --> 11:09.454
and just putting things
in the cart.

11:09.674 --> 11:11.452
That's not gonna happen.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.069
Um... what's all this?

11:16.324 --> 11:17.952
They just keep coming.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.846
Well, congratulations.

11:19.931 --> 11:21.553
That must mean everyone's
happy.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.163
Oh, very happy, yes.

11:23.459 --> 11:25.836
Thanks to your little attack
of the corvidae,

11:25.921 --> 11:28.919
we are Interflix's number one
stream of the day.

11:29.004 --> 11:30.644
Tied only with the fourth
season

11:30.729 --> 11:31.998
of "Caroline in the City."

11:32.381 --> 11:33.960
From Interflix.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.438
"To Alexis,

11:38.188 --> 11:39.796
congratulations and thank you.

11:39.881 --> 11:42.503
The competition is eating
crow."

11:42.662 --> 11:45.220
"Love, your new best friends
at Interflix."

11:47.097 --> 11:48.751
They're all for you.

11:50.623 --> 11:52.802
Not those - those are from
Joyce Dewitt.

11:53.195 --> 11:54.689
I didn't want to overwhelm you,
dear,

11:54.774 --> 11:57.224
I know you're being pulled
in another direction.

11:57.309 --> 12:01.417
Though, you might find a bit
more delectation in this.

12:01.502 --> 12:04.335
No, I do. I... I just like
haven't received flowers

12:04.420 --> 12:07.098
from someone I wasn't...
friends with.

12:08.804 --> 12:10.209
What do I do?

12:10.561 --> 12:11.960
What do you want to do?

12:12.045 --> 12:13.884
I can't leave now.

12:13.969 --> 12:15.258
If you're worried
about the flowers,

12:15.342 --> 12:16.701
they'll likely be dead
in a week.

12:16.786 --> 12:18.261
Yeah, like my career
if I walk away

12:18.345 --> 12:20.267
with everything that's
going on.

12:20.408 --> 12:22.152
I've already made Ted wait
an extra month.

12:22.237 --> 12:24.652
I can't... back out now.

12:25.065 --> 12:27.813
So you...
you weigh your options.

12:28.094 --> 12:29.753
On the one hand,
you are perched

12:29.838 --> 12:32.104
on the precipice
of a dream come true

12:32.439 --> 12:36.020
and you can jump knowing,
possibly for the first time,

12:36.123 --> 12:37.883
that you can succeed
at anything

12:37.968 --> 12:40.144
to which you put your mind.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.608
And on the other hand?

12:42.693 --> 12:45.302
- What other hand?
- Ted!

12:46.206 --> 12:47.460
Dear Ted.

12:47.869 --> 12:49.422
Yes, this is a quandary.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:59.362 --> 13:02.301
Well, things seem to be
going well.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.890
Yeah, look, they're standing
pretty close together.

13:04.975 --> 13:06.289
That must be a good sign.

13:06.374 --> 13:07.857
Yeah, and he's not crossing
his arms.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.534
- That's good body language.
- And... they're hugging!

13:09.618 --> 13:11.057
Uh-huh.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.491
And... now he's walking away.
Okay.

13:13.663 --> 13:15.929
Well? How'd it go, Bob?

13:16.116 --> 13:18.078
It looked like you two
were hitting off.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.427
What're the odds of...

13:19.511 --> 13:21.432
running into my marriage
counselor here?

13:21.517 --> 13:23.443
I'm sorry, did you just say

13:23.528 --> 13:25.472
you picked up your marriage
counselor?

13:25.557 --> 13:26.645
No.

13:26.730 --> 13:29.349
I'm saying she told me
she can't keep seeing me.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.875
Apparently, there's a conflict
of interest

13:31.960 --> 13:34.621
and, uh, she's chosen to go
with Gwen.

13:34.756 --> 13:37.444
But... I can't blame her.

13:37.529 --> 13:38.768
Okay,

13:39.009 --> 13:41.145
can we try my system now?

13:41.398 --> 13:43.408
We all laugh,
on the count of three,

13:43.492 --> 13:45.857
as if Bob just told
a very funny joke.

13:45.942 --> 13:47.452
Oh, no pressure.

13:47.537 --> 13:49.468
Well, you don't actually
have to tell a joke, Bob.

13:49.552 --> 13:51.339
Just act like you did.

13:51.424 --> 13:55.351
And that might attract uh...
you know, someone's attention.

13:55.436 --> 13:56.798
What if they ask me
what I said?

13:56.883 --> 13:58.249
Well, they're not gonna ask
you what you said.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.608
I don't know, Johnny.

13:59.693 --> 14:01.817
This sounds like a really
complicated plan.

14:02.027 --> 14:04.012
- Mm-hmm.
- It couldn't be more simple.

14:04.097 --> 14:06.122
Just follow my lead.

14:16.868 --> 14:18.960
It's working.
It's working. Working.

14:19.045 --> 14:20.607
Is something funny?

14:20.705 --> 14:22.145
Well, now that you
mention it...

14:22.230 --> 14:23.826
Because it looked like you
were laughing at me.

14:25.316 --> 14:29.211
No, It's, it's just my very
available friend, Bob here,

14:29.296 --> 14:31.562
just said something so funny.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.285
- What'd you say?
- You said they wouldn't ask.

14:34.369 --> 14:36.722
Okay, I'm not saying
I'm bailing on this,

14:36.806 --> 14:39.793
but... I think I'm gonna go
mingle and...

14:40.047 --> 14:41.782
I might not come back.

14:41.867 --> 14:44.475
It's not so much, uh,
what he said,

14:44.560 --> 14:47.758
it was just, uh, it was a funny
observation.

14:47.913 --> 14:50.806
Well, next time,
observe someone else.

14:53.794 --> 14:56.060
Crrrash and burn, Johnny.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.486
Boy, I... I buckled
under the pressure.

14:59.712 --> 15:02.364
But she was a dead ringer
for Gwen.

15:07.008 --> 15:10.344
Oh, didn't know we were
bringing our friends tonight.

15:10.429 --> 15:11.740
'Kay, I knew I shouldn't have
worn this shirt.

15:11.824 --> 15:13.975
- No, it's nice, it's nice.
- Is it new?

15:14.060 --> 15:15.681
And does it come in
an adult size?

15:15.766 --> 15:17.738
It's not new.
I just haven't worn it yet.

15:17.823 --> 15:20.004
- So it is new then.
- Is that cologne I smell?

15:20.089 --> 15:23.006
No. This is a leather-scented
body moisturizer.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.929
So, you... you moisturized
your body then.

15:27.144 --> 15:29.084
You know what?
Why don't we not do this?

15:29.168 --> 15:30.478
This is getting a bit
complicated.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.393
The only thing that's
complicated here

15:32.478 --> 15:33.668
is the length of your sleeves.

15:33.752 --> 15:35.279
Go long, go short.
Just pick one.

15:35.364 --> 15:38.027
Um, as for this?
If one of us wants to leave

15:38.112 --> 15:39.389
and the other one wants
to stay, then...

15:39.473 --> 15:41.696
- We both leave.
- We... both leave, yeah.

15:41.871 --> 15:45.778
So... I think you should knock
on the door

15:45.863 --> 15:48.444
because these arms are nice
and warmed up.

15:49.405 --> 15:50.540
All right.

15:54.819 --> 15:56.102
Hi, boys.

15:56.187 --> 15:58.145
So glad you could make it.
Come on in.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.272
Oh wow.

16:04.357 --> 16:06.710
A lot of people are here
for drinks, David.

16:06.795 --> 16:08.101
Yeah, a few more are on
their way.

16:08.185 --> 16:09.798
Make yourselves at home, boys.

16:10.033 --> 16:11.603
- Great shirt, by the way.
- Aw.

16:11.727 --> 16:12.637
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.091
Um...

16:14.973 --> 16:18.217
We left our wine in the car.
Oh.

16:18.302 --> 16:19.454
So we should go get that.

16:19.539 --> 16:21.544
Oh, don't worry about it.
Plenty of vino here.

16:21.629 --> 16:24.689
Yeah, it's just that ours
is um...

16:25.324 --> 16:26.770
- kosher.
- Mm.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.507
Well, hurry back. We're gonna
start the massage circle soon.

16:29.592 --> 16:31.771
- Oh...
- Don't wanna miss it.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.621
Think you're up
for the massage circle?

16:33.705 --> 16:35.624
- This is way too many people.
- Yeah.

16:35.709 --> 16:37.756
You have your coat.
We should go.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.540
And... Stevie?

16:39.798 --> 16:42.417
Oh... my God.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.932
Huh.

16:44.107 --> 16:45.590
What're you doing here?

16:45.674 --> 16:49.115
- What're you two doing here?
- We were...

16:49.541 --> 16:51.683
- We were just...
- Invited for drinks?

16:51.956 --> 16:53.424
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:53.508 --> 16:54.594
We came here to say hi

16:54.679 --> 16:55.803
- and now we're leaving.
- Mmhmm.

16:55.887 --> 16:58.066
Can I not have one thing
for myself?

16:58.229 --> 17:00.712
No. Anyway,
we're gonna go.

17:00.807 --> 17:02.118
You gonna come with?

17:02.203 --> 17:05.237
Uh... I still have like...
half a drink left,

17:05.321 --> 17:06.915
so I think I'm gonna finish it
here, and then...

17:06.999 --> 17:08.148
meet you guys later?

17:08.233 --> 17:10.021
- No, you won't.
- No, I won't.

17:10.393 --> 17:12.137
- Okay.
- Have fun.

17:12.382 --> 17:13.744
Bye.

17:23.406 --> 17:25.064
Hey, sorry I'm late.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.457
Myrtle was laying her eggs

17:26.540 --> 17:27.829
and the whole team
was really excited.

17:27.913 --> 17:30.417
Mmm! Yeah, I bet.
Fresh omelettes.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.786
Well, Myrtle's a green sea
turtle,

17:32.871 --> 17:34.742
and they only spawn
every two years,

17:34.827 --> 17:37.158
so eating her eggs would
actually disrupt

17:37.243 --> 17:38.426
an entire ecosystem.

17:38.511 --> 17:40.472
Plus, there's like a ton
of cholesterol.

17:40.557 --> 17:43.338
Mm. Um, well, it sounds
like you're super busy,

17:43.423 --> 17:45.880
so I don't wanna take up
too much of your time,

17:45.965 --> 17:48.565
um, but I actually wanted
to talk to you about something.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.263
I know what you're going
to say, Alexis.

17:50.347 --> 17:52.952
- You do?
- I've been dropping the ball

17:53.037 --> 17:54.746
when it comes to our phone
dates.

17:54.830 --> 17:57.655
Between juggling work
and, and the time difference...

17:57.740 --> 17:59.664
No, Ted, you haven't done
anything wrong.

17:59.854 --> 18:01.492
We've both been so busy
with work,

18:01.576 --> 18:03.407
and then on top of all of that,
you've been...

18:03.491 --> 18:05.688
renovating your entire
apartment for me.

18:05.773 --> 18:07.672
Well, I put some screens
on the windows.

18:07.756 --> 18:09.440
I wouldn't really call it
a renovation.

18:09.533 --> 18:11.132
Okay, well, you bought
a juicer.

18:12.067 --> 18:14.790
Um, but the more
I've been thinking about it,

18:14.901 --> 18:17.723
the more I feel... like...

18:17.842 --> 18:20.423
- I think you should stay where you are.
- Maybe I should stay here.

18:20.507 --> 18:22.522
Sorry, did, did you say
something?

18:22.607 --> 18:25.004
No. Um... What did you say?

18:25.251 --> 18:27.955
I can't have you come here,
Alexis. You'll hate it.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.943
And I'm not just saying that
because the screens that I installed

18:31.028 --> 18:33.899
are actually attracting
more bugs somehow.

18:33.984 --> 18:37.468
But you'd be leaving everything
that you're doing to come here,

18:37.553 --> 18:40.495
and... I can't guarantee that
there won't have another trip

18:40.580 --> 18:42.965
that takes me away
for days at a time.

18:43.085 --> 18:46.439
D-don't get me wrong,
I want you here so bad,

18:46.523 --> 18:47.946
but I know you.

18:48.031 --> 18:50.311
And no matter how many juices
I buy,

18:50.396 --> 18:52.417
this place just won't feel
like home.

18:56.422 --> 18:58.560
Sorry. I can't tell
if the screen's frozen,

18:58.645 --> 18:59.560
or if you're just really
shocked.

18:59.645 --> 19:01.859
But if you still want to come,
I'm not gonna tell you not to.

19:01.943 --> 19:04.021
No, no, no, no. Um...

19:04.106 --> 19:06.386
you've made some very valid
points.

19:06.471 --> 19:07.783
Yeah. I didn't even tell you

19:07.868 --> 19:09.349
about the shared bathroom
situation.

19:09.434 --> 19:12.115
Okay, well... maybe you
could've led with that.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.742
Would've saved us some time.

19:13.827 --> 19:16.656
Um, but I guess we just
wait it out?

19:17.211 --> 19:19.129
Seems like our only option.

19:19.309 --> 19:21.575
Yeah, until somebody invents
teleportation.

19:23.189 --> 19:26.695
Okay, well, um...
nobody's home,

19:26.780 --> 19:29.316
so why don't we start
by teleporting you

19:29.401 --> 19:30.744
out of that shirt?

19:31.085 --> 19:32.851
That's not really how
teleportation works,

19:32.936 --> 19:34.356
but I think that I can...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.576
Aww... not again!

19:36.660 --> 19:39.437
I'm so sorry, uh,
but the ants are back

19:39.522 --> 19:41.273
and, uh, I think
what we're about to do

19:41.358 --> 19:44.124
probably wouldn't end very well
if a fire ant was involved.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.500
Um, rain check?

19:46.585 --> 19:47.984
Rain check.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.241
I love you!

19:50.467 --> 19:52.165
Uh, mm, oh!

19:53.808 --> 19:55.331
Love you.

20:02.921 --> 20:05.076
Hey, I'm heading out.

20:05.161 --> 20:06.406
Calling it a night?

20:06.490 --> 20:09.523
Well, actually, my night
is just beginning.

20:09.689 --> 20:12.528
Whoa... Welcome to
the players' club.

20:12.613 --> 20:14.377
No, I'm not high-fiving that.

20:14.568 --> 20:16.667
Look, her name is Vanessa,

20:16.752 --> 20:18.731
and she has a very single,

20:18.826 --> 20:21.252
very attractive friend
over there,

20:21.337 --> 20:22.596
who was just telling me about

20:22.680 --> 20:25.293
all the trouble she's having
with her car.

20:25.404 --> 20:27.742
Bob, this is right up
your alley.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.133
Nobody knows their way around
cars like you.

20:30.218 --> 20:32.987
Yeah, I, uh, was really
hoping to not talk shop.

20:33.072 --> 20:35.283
Bob, just go over
and talk to her.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.528
Look, be yourself.

20:38.092 --> 20:40.356
Have a mint.
Go, go, go, go.

20:42.265 --> 20:44.356
And that, gentlemen,

20:44.441 --> 20:46.920
is how it's done. Bye!

20:49.058 --> 20:51.997
You know, Roland,
I do not miss being single.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.062
Whoa, here's to that.

20:54.146 --> 20:55.828
Cheers, my friend.

20:55.913 --> 20:58.839
Not that I didn't have fun
in my day.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.056
They actually used to call me
"the closer."

21:01.141 --> 21:02.946
Yeah.
Well, that was probably

21:03.031 --> 21:04.899
because women used to close out
their tabs and go home

21:04.983 --> 21:06.665
when you came into the bar.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.713
All right, speaking of
closing out tabs,

21:08.798 --> 21:10.041
I think we should get out
of here.

21:10.125 --> 21:12.305
Which is what the women used
to say to each other

21:12.390 --> 21:13.776
when they saw you walking
through the door.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.909
I'm not setting you up
anymore, Roland.

21:15.993 --> 21:17.650
Which is that what
your matchmaker said!

21:18.203 --> 21:19.748
Oh boy...
