WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:03.792
MIKE:
You should

00:03.792 --> 00:05.495
consider yourself lucky.
A couple short months,

00:05.495 --> 00:08.198
-you’re gonna be a brother.
-Why is that lucky?

00:08.198 --> 00:10.495
Why is that lucky? Well, whoever
it is, you’re can have fun with.

00:10.495 --> 00:11.759
You can spend
a whole weekend saying,

00:11.759 --> 00:13.165
"Hey, why are you
hitting yourself?

00:13.165 --> 00:14.858
-Stop hitting yourself."
-Quit it! Quit it!
-Dad.

00:14.858 --> 00:16.924
-No, stop...
-Quit it! Ow!
-Dad?

00:16.924 --> 00:19.759
-KRISTIN: Hi.
-Stop it! Stop hitting yourself!

00:19.759 --> 00:22.099
I don’t know
what’s wrong with you.

00:22.099 --> 00:25.363
Mandy used to hit herself, too.

00:25.363 --> 00:26.792
I’m gonna go set up
the hockey goal.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.000
And then I’ll teach you
about noogies.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.033
I’m good at this.

00:29.033 --> 00:30.297
Yeah, my brother,
eight years old,

00:30.297 --> 00:32.660
had a bald spot from
all the rubbing.

00:34.198 --> 00:35.693
-BOYD: Hi, Grandma.
-Hi, sweetie.

00:35.693 --> 00:38.495
Well, guys,
how was the baby shower?

00:38.495 --> 00:40.462
Amazing.
But it wasn’t a shower.

00:40.462 --> 00:41.924
-It was a sprinkle.
-Oh.

00:41.924 --> 00:44.297
Which is a smaller get-together
you do before the shower.

00:44.297 --> 00:45.594
Everybody’s doing them.

00:45.594 --> 00:48.924
"Before shower."
So, uh, BS.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.264
Look, we took so many pictures.

00:51.825 --> 00:55.198
-Look at all the pictures!
-Oh, yeah, yeah.-Kristin looks so cute.
Want to see?
-Oh, my God. And then...

00:51.825 --> 00:55.198
-Yeah, show him. Look, here,
she’s wearing this little hat...
-(chattering)

00:55.198 --> 00:56.858
You know what, you know what?

00:56.858 --> 01:00.693
How about I just look at her,
she’s right here. Look at that.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.099
You know what? Fine. I’ll
just... I’ll put them online,

01:02.099 --> 01:03.198
and you can look at them later.

01:03.198 --> 01:05.132
You know, when you used to have
to pay for film,

01:05.132 --> 01:07.363
every photo wasn’t
an event, right?

01:07.363 --> 01:09.957
My birth photo
and my graduation from college--

01:09.957 --> 01:11.891
same roll of film.

01:12.858 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, you know what?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.759
That’s the big crisis
facing the planet.

01:15.759 --> 01:17.561
Too much joy-sharing.

01:19.792 --> 01:23.132
Uh, uh-oh, looks like Boyd
is tangled in the hockey net.

01:23.132 --> 01:24.924
-Oh. You gonna get get him?
-No.

01:24.924 --> 01:26.759
Ha-ha, but I am gonna
get a picture.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.957
You know what? I am having
the best time with Kristin.

01:31.957 --> 01:33.957
-Yeah?
-And you want to hear
the most exciting part?

01:33.957 --> 01:36.627
-Mm-hmm?
-She wants
a gender reveal party.

01:36.627 --> 01:38.759
Yay, more parties.

01:38.759 --> 01:41.759
You know, I would throw
the best party ever.

01:41.759 --> 01:43.660
Now, that video would go viral.

01:43.660 --> 01:47.000
"Go viral." Remember when
that used to mean a high fever,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.363
severe itching, and body sores?

01:49.363 --> 01:51.396
I miss those days.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.726
♪ ♪

01:59.495 --> 02:01.264
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

02:01.264 --> 02:04.693
-Got a sec?
-Yeah. For you, 30 seconds.

02:04.693 --> 02:07.693
But for my grandchild,
all the time in the world.

02:07.693 --> 02:09.858
(chuckles) Good.

02:09.858 --> 02:11.000
Uh, I wanted to talk to you

02:11.000 --> 02:12.957
about the gender reveal party.

02:12.957 --> 02:15.462
Put me down for plus-none.

02:15.462 --> 02:18.957
Right. Um, so the person
in charge of the gender reveal

02:18.957 --> 02:21.297
has a lot of responsibility.

02:21.297 --> 02:26.000
Sure. Let’s see, do we buy
pink confetti or blue confetti?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.198
It’s just like Eisenhower
during D-Day.

02:28.198 --> 02:30.957
Yeah.

02:30.957 --> 02:32.792
And much like D-Day,
the hardest part

02:32.792 --> 02:35.594
is keeping the secret
until the very last minute.

02:35.594 --> 02:38.660
Until then, only that person
and the doctor knows

02:38.660 --> 02:40.264
what is in here.

02:40.264 --> 02:42.957
You’re worried about your mom
cracking and spilling the beans.

02:42.957 --> 02:45.660
Ah, you hit the nail
on that curly blonde head.

02:47.825 --> 02:50.198
Which is why, uh, Ryan and I

02:50.198 --> 02:53.330
would like to have you do it.

02:53.330 --> 02:57.033
(chuckles)

02:57.033 --> 02:59.363
You want me to plan a party?

02:59.363 --> 03:01.627
Yeah... No, I know you think
that they’re ridiculous

03:01.627 --> 03:03.693
-and you don’t want
to be there...
-I’ll do it, I’ll do it.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.792
Wh... I’m-I’m sorry?
I thought you hated parties.

03:07.792 --> 03:11.726
I hate parties. But I love
tormenting your mother.

03:13.099 --> 03:15.924
(chuckling)
And me knowing something

03:15.924 --> 03:19.264
that she really wants to know
is gonna drive her crazy.

03:19.264 --> 03:22.198
Yeah, um, Dad, that’s-that’s
not really why we’re asking you.

03:22.198 --> 03:23.528
I know, that’s just a perk.

03:23.528 --> 03:24.858
Um...

03:24.858 --> 03:26.924
Wait, have you told her yet?

03:26.924 --> 03:30.198
-No.
-Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t.
Let me do it.

03:30.198 --> 03:32.858
I’m gonna savor
every minute of this.

03:32.858 --> 03:34.297
This is great.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.330
Don’t look at me like that.

03:35.330 --> 03:38.000
She would do the same thing
to me.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.627
That’s why we make
such a great couple.

03:39.627 --> 03:43.363
You have an odd marriage.

03:43.363 --> 03:45.198
Every relationship’s
about power,

03:45.198 --> 03:48.099
and you just gave me
the nuclear codes.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.165
Oh, just the man
I’m looking for.

03:54.165 --> 03:56.363
Chuck, do you happen
to be free this weekend?

03:56.363 --> 03:59.165
I’m free! Count me in.

03:59.165 --> 04:00.462
You shouldn’t agree
to do something

04:00.462 --> 04:01.759
before you know what it is.

04:01.759 --> 04:03.792
That’s easy for you
to say, Chuck.

04:03.792 --> 04:06.132
You’re not lonely.

04:06.132 --> 04:09.693
Well, as you know, you know,
Bonnie’s moving in with me

04:09.693 --> 04:11.759
after we’re married,
and I’m remodeling a room

04:11.759 --> 04:13.957
-just for her.
-Oh, which room?

04:13.957 --> 04:15.891
The discotheque.

04:17.198 --> 04:19.033
I barely go in there,
so, you know...

04:19.033 --> 04:21.165
So you need somebody to, uh...

04:21.165 --> 04:22.627
To paint the place,
hang some shelves,

04:22.627 --> 04:25.264
and find a buyer for
a giant mirrored ball.

04:26.495 --> 04:28.957
-Let me think about it.
-ED: You already said

04:28.957 --> 04:31.297
that you’re free and lonely,
all right?

04:31.297 --> 04:33.363
Hard to walk that back.

04:33.363 --> 04:35.693
All right, I’m in.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.429
I’ll do it for the disco ball.

04:37.429 --> 04:39.924
Perfect last touch
for my man cave.

04:39.924 --> 04:41.528
Sold, sold, sold.
There you go.

04:41.528 --> 04:42.858
Hey, wait a minute.
I didn’t know

04:42.858 --> 04:45.264
we were asking for stuff.
I’d like a thousand dollars.

04:45.264 --> 04:48.957
Huh. How about I order you
a pizza?

04:48.957 --> 04:51.363
Done.

04:55.132 --> 04:57.198
Hey, Jen.
Is Vanessa around?

04:57.198 --> 04:58.363
I think she’s upstairs.

04:58.363 --> 05:00.792
Okay. Little warning...

05:00.792 --> 05:03.198
you might want to put
your guard up around her

05:03.198 --> 05:04.363
until Saturday.

05:04.363 --> 05:05.429
Why?

05:05.429 --> 05:08.495
Get this: Kristin asked me

05:08.495 --> 05:11.363
to put on
the gender reveal party.

05:11.363 --> 05:13.330
It’s gonna make
my beautiful, lovely wife

05:13.330 --> 05:15.528
go stark, raving mad.

05:16.528 --> 05:18.132
She asked you?

05:18.132 --> 05:19.858
But Vanessa was convinced
\hshe would be the one 

05:19.858 --> 05:21.627
trusted to do this
unpleasant task.

05:21.627 --> 05:24.693
I know...

05:24.693 --> 05:27.924
Your attitude is confusing.

05:27.924 --> 05:32.429
Is it some cultural difference
I don’t understand,

05:32.429 --> 05:34.858
or are you just being a jerk?

05:35.825 --> 05:38.264
Bingo.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.957
All she wants to know
is the gender of this kid

05:41.957 --> 05:43.297
before anybody else.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.594
But now only you will know
that secret.

05:45.594 --> 05:48.132
I know.

05:48.132 --> 05:50.594
So why do I need
to keep my guard up?

05:50.594 --> 05:51.957
She’ll probably try to work you
for information.

05:51.957 --> 05:54.363
-And you want to be
on the winning team.
-Hey.

05:54.363 --> 05:56.264
-Hey.
-Hey, Jen. Hi, honey.

05:56.264 --> 05:59.429
-Hi, baby.
-Uh, what winning team?

05:59.429 --> 06:01.792
The field hockey team at school.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.495
They’re a winning team.
I might try to join.

06:03.495 --> 06:04.693
Maybe I’ll be a middle fielder,

06:04.693 --> 06:06.000
although Mr. Baxter thinks
I’ll be more effective

06:06.000 --> 06:07.198
as an attacker,
like maybe right wing,

06:07.198 --> 06:08.363
and I’m going to take that
into consideration,

06:08.363 --> 06:11.231
but I really need
to finish my homework.

06:13.198 --> 06:18.132
Uh... how was your day?

06:18.132 --> 06:21.297
-A little slower than that.
-(both chuckle)

06:21.297 --> 06:23.627
I had a great day, actually.
Had a great lunch, hamburger,

06:23.627 --> 06:25.165
garlic fries;
oh, and Kris asked me

06:25.165 --> 06:26.825
to plan the gender reveal party.

06:26.825 --> 06:28.792
What?

06:28.792 --> 06:30.297
She asked you to do it?

06:30.297 --> 06:32.297
Yes, indeed.

06:32.297 --> 06:34.924
What?
I thought she was gonna ask me.

06:34.924 --> 06:37.528
Yeah. Well, now, I’m the only
one that’s gonna know

06:37.528 --> 06:40.396
if we’re gonna have a grandson
or a granddaughter.

06:44.330 --> 06:47.429
-Okay.
-Ha-ha.

06:47.429 --> 06:48.627
Wait, wh... whoa-whoa-whoa.

06:48.627 --> 06:49.957
Is that how you’re gonna
play this?

06:49.957 --> 06:51.429
Like you really don’t
want to know?

06:51.429 --> 06:53.627
Honey. No, of course
I want to know,

06:53.627 --> 06:56.198
and I will know, at the party,
when everybody else does.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.264
But in the meantime,
I’m just gonna

06:58.264 --> 07:00.264
enjoy the excitement
building every day

07:00.264 --> 07:02.033
from now until then.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.297
She didn’t seem upset at all.

07:07.297 --> 07:10.297
No, she didn’t.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.561
She came to play.

07:19.825 --> 07:22.000
-Hi, Vanessa.
-Hey.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.462
What are you doing?

07:23.462 --> 07:26.660
I’m just helping Mike out a bit
by setting up the drinks table.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.627
Cool. Cool.

07:29.627 --> 07:33.297
So, did you find out
whether it’s a boy or a girl?

07:33.297 --> 07:34.825
Uh, I don’t know.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.396
(chuckling):
Only Mike knows that.

07:37.594 --> 07:40.363
It’s killing me.

07:42.330 --> 07:45.198
You know, we could probably
come up with a plan

07:45.198 --> 07:47.000
to find out before
everyone else does.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I doubt it. Mike is pretty good
at keeping a secret.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.924
Oh, yeah?

07:51.924 --> 07:55.858
Well, I’m pretty good at getting
people to tell me secrets.

07:55.858 --> 07:58.495
That’s how I found out
Kyle’s PIN number.

07:58.495 --> 08:00.792
Oh, come on. Everybody knows
Kyle’s PIN number,

08:00.792 --> 08:03.165
it’s one-two-three-four.

08:03.165 --> 08:06.132
See, I didn’t know that.

08:06.132 --> 08:08.297
But now I do.

08:08.297 --> 08:10.957
Well, I am sure
you’re very good,

08:10.957 --> 08:12.825
but it is very hard
to trick Mike Baxter.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.363
Seriously, what is your plan?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.429
I don’t have one.

08:18.429 --> 08:20.660
I’m just gonna find out
when everybody else does.

08:23.429 --> 08:25.495
There is no plan.

08:25.495 --> 08:27.528
There’s got to be a plan.
There’s got to be.

08:27.528 --> 08:30.759
Listen, go back in there
and find out what she’s up to.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.066
You go in there.

08:34.198 --> 08:37.561
I’ll stay here
and guard the piñata.

08:38.528 --> 08:41.132
This isn’t a piñata.
This is the finest

08:41.132 --> 08:42.825
confetti cannon money can buy.

08:42.825 --> 08:46.528
This is the same unit Elton John
uses for all his concerts,

08:46.528 --> 08:48.528
his house parties,
and every time

08:48.528 --> 08:50.330
he gets out of a car.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.198
Have you considered
the possibility

08:53.198 --> 08:54.858
that Vanessa
doesn’t have a plan,

08:54.858 --> 08:56.660
and she’s just being honest?

08:56.660 --> 08:59.693
Yeah.
Uh, that would be a nightmare.

08:59.693 --> 09:01.198
Why?

09:01.198 --> 09:03.429
Because if this isn’t
driving her crazy,

09:03.429 --> 09:07.330
all I’d be is a party planner.

09:10.660 --> 09:11.792
(knock at door)

09:11.792 --> 09:15.330
Okay, that’s a...
Oh, hey,

09:15.330 --> 09:17.099
look at that.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.825
Great job, fellas.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.957
Great job. Terrific.
All right. Now--

09:20.957 --> 09:24.363
-Now for the fun part.
-Right, heading home
with my Zumba ball.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.627
I mean, disco ball.

09:26.627 --> 09:28.363
No. Just put everything
in these boxes

09:28.363 --> 09:29.627
up on those shelves, that’s all.

09:29.627 --> 09:31.198
Oh, sounds easy.
What have you got there?

09:31.198 --> 09:33.792
Okay. Dolls. Yeah?

09:33.792 --> 09:35.429
Yeah, there are a couple
of dozen or so, so...

09:35.429 --> 09:37.858
let’s just get them
on these shelves...

09:37.858 --> 09:40.792
and call it a weekend.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.693
(playful teasing, chuckles)

09:43.693 --> 09:45.528
Let’s see, now...

09:45.528 --> 09:48.660
Hey, you guys finished
ahead of schedule.

09:48.660 --> 09:51.891
So... I’ll cancel the pizza.

10:02.099 --> 10:04.132
-You okay, buddy?
-I don’t like dolls.

10:04.132 --> 10:05.759
I don’t like their eyes,
I don’t like their heads,

10:05.759 --> 10:07.099
I don’t like the fact that

10:07.099 --> 10:08.330
they think they’re better
than you.

10:09.825 --> 10:11.693
(laughs) Relax, Joe.

10:11.693 --> 10:13.264
They’re just toys.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.297
Yeah, until it’s nighttime
and you’re asleep.

10:15.297 --> 10:16.957
And you think
they’re asleep, too.

10:16.957 --> 10:21.165
(chuckling): You’ve seen
far too many movies, man.

10:21.165 --> 10:22.462
Oh, really, Chuck?

10:22.462 --> 10:26.363
Or should I say, Chucky?

10:26.363 --> 10:29.132
You can say whatever you want,

10:29.132 --> 10:32.396
but you are not dragging me into
your private little freak-out.

10:37.594 --> 10:39.000
You don’t think this is creepy?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.924
No, man.
I was in Desert Storm.

10:41.924 --> 10:44.264
It’s gonna take a lot more
than that to scare me.

10:44.264 --> 10:46.594
-DOLL: Mama.
-(screams)

10:47.528 --> 10:50.264
I knew it.
One of them’s still alive.

10:50.264 --> 10:51.924
Maybe more.

10:51.924 --> 10:54.858
Let’s just-- let’s just
get out of here, okay?

10:54.858 --> 10:58.594
-Open the door.
-I’m trying, but it’s stuck.

10:58.594 --> 11:00.297
Mama.

11:00.297 --> 11:02.759
(both scream)

11:05.495 --> 11:08.000
I don’t know about you guys,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.528
but I have no idea how my dad’s
gonna do the big reveal.

11:10.528 --> 11:13.528
Oh, if I know Mr. B,
it’s gonna be big and loud.

11:13.528 --> 11:16.132
I’m the father, and if Mike
has any respect for me at all,

11:16.132 --> 11:19.825
he’s not gonna do some
big, macho explosion.

11:19.825 --> 11:23.000
He’s gonna do a big,
macho explosion.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Hey, hon.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.429
Uh, look, I don’t want
to horn in on your party,

11:27.429 --> 11:30.957
but, um, what do you think
of this cradle, huh? It’s cute.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.594
You know what’s cute?

11:32.594 --> 11:35.363
This little game you’re playing.

11:35.363 --> 11:36.792
(sighs)

11:36.792 --> 11:38.858
Mike, what-what are you being
crazy about now?

11:38.858 --> 11:40.297
Ah, nothing.
I know you’re dying

11:40.297 --> 11:42.759
-to know what this kid is.
-Yeah, well...

11:42.759 --> 11:46.594
But I just can’t figure out
what your... your angle is.

11:46.594 --> 11:48.693
(laughs)
I don’t have an angle.

11:48.693 --> 11:51.297
Look, I’m sorry, I guess
I’ve just matured into someone

11:51.297 --> 11:53.627
who doesn’t need to know
everyone’s secrets.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.627
So, the cradle?

11:55.627 --> 11:56.825
Too busy.

11:56.825 --> 11:59.000
(scoffs)

11:59.000 --> 12:00.825
Hey, great party, Mr. B.

12:00.825 --> 12:03.033
Whatever.

12:04.429 --> 12:06.330
Yeah, even with the food,
you’re keeping us guessing.

12:06.330 --> 12:09.198
First hotdogs, then tacos.

12:09.198 --> 12:10.924
Brilliant.

12:10.924 --> 12:12.627
Just go ahead and say it.

12:12.627 --> 12:14.924
I’m an amazing
little party planner.

12:14.924 --> 12:18.132
You’re an amazing
little party planner.

12:18.132 --> 12:20.858
I got into this racket
to annoy my wife,

12:20.858 --> 12:22.858
and now she’s matured.

12:22.858 --> 12:24.858
So you know what that makes me?

12:24.858 --> 12:28.924
An amazing little party planner?

12:28.924 --> 12:33.726
It makes me a man
who fans out napkins.

12:36.495 --> 12:39.330
Napkins.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.330
Okay, I’m not entirely sure
what’s happening right now.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.693
-So can I...?
-Go.

12:47.693 --> 12:49.825
All right, everybody. I’m gonna
let the cat out of the bag.

12:49.825 --> 12:51.165
Five minutes.

12:52.132 --> 12:55.033
So that’s how he’s gonna do it.

12:58.297 --> 13:00.363
I hate this stupid party.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.495
You know you’re talking
to the party planner?

13:02.495 --> 13:04.528
What do you mean,
you hate this party?

13:04.528 --> 13:06.363
I didn’t get a party,

13:06.363 --> 13:09.429
but I guess I was
just Mom’s big mistake.

13:15.099 --> 13:18.693
Listen up. Might be more
like six minutes.

13:18.693 --> 13:22.198
Ooh.
I bet the cat got out.

13:29.297 --> 13:31.330
Hey, Boyd.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.165
Cut the TV off.
We got to talk.

13:33.165 --> 13:34.693
I’m fine.

13:34.693 --> 13:38.396
Listen, nobody who watches
Don Lemon is fine.

13:41.099 --> 13:42.858
Did you really mean
what you said,

13:42.858 --> 13:44.759
about being
your mom’s big mistake?

13:44.759 --> 13:46.825
It’s true, isn’t it?

13:46.825 --> 13:49.462
You weren’t the biggest mistake.

13:49.462 --> 13:53.330
You were a monumental,
colossal, gigantic mistake.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.462
What?

13:55.462 --> 13:58.495
Listen, when an unmarried
high school girl gets pregnant,

13:58.495 --> 14:00.330
we don’t throw parties.

14:00.330 --> 14:03.132
Most times, the families move.

14:03.132 --> 14:05.660
Did you come in here
to make me feel better?

14:05.660 --> 14:07.297
I came in here
to tell you the truth.

14:07.297 --> 14:09.297
It was a really rough time
for everybody.

14:09.297 --> 14:11.660
We didn’t know
what was gonna happen.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.660
Okay.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.594
-Thank you for telling me
the truth.
-I’m not finished yet.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.495
Then you happened.

14:19.495 --> 14:23.330
March 14, 2:15 in the morning.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.330
Your grandma was
the birth coach, I was somewhere

14:25.330 --> 14:28.000
in the hospital
looking for salty snacks.

14:29.264 --> 14:32.132
But I heard you, and man,
you were a loud kid.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.132
-I was?
-Yeah.

14:34.132 --> 14:35.693
I think you woke up
the coma patients

14:35.693 --> 14:37.924
on the other side
of the hospital.

14:39.099 --> 14:41.858
Wait, you’re calling me loud?

14:41.858 --> 14:44.462
When I first heard you,

14:44.462 --> 14:49.429
suddenly,
there was no mistake anymore.

14:49.429 --> 14:52.099
It was just you.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.726
And you made everything better.

14:56.264 --> 14:58.099
So you were never ashamed of me?

14:58.099 --> 14:59.528
No.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.165
Well...

15:02.165 --> 15:03.594
Come on, you dropped a pass

15:03.594 --> 15:05.033
in the end zone,
could’ve won the game.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.825
I wasn’t-- that wasn’t
the best moment for me--

15:06.825 --> 15:08.825
I was...

15:08.825 --> 15:11.858
No. No.

15:11.858 --> 15:14.099
All right.

15:14.099 --> 15:17.033
Now, how would you like to help
me introduce the newest member

15:17.033 --> 15:18.660
of this family?

15:18.660 --> 15:21.363
I am loud.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.528
Come on.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.759
Oh, and just so you know,
that was a tough pass to catch.

15:27.759 --> 15:30.858
-I mean, it hit me
in a bad spot.
-Yeah. Your hands.

15:34.297 --> 15:36.627
Okay, this is
the sixth message, Ed.

15:36.627 --> 15:39.330
We’re locked in your doll room.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.033
-What are you doing?
-I’ve seen enough movies to know

15:45.033 --> 15:47.429
you don’t turn your back
on a haunted doll.

15:47.429 --> 15:50.693
There’s no such thing
as a haunted doll.

15:53.198 --> 15:56.495
There is no such thing.

15:56.495 --> 15:57.759
(knocking on door)

15:59.858 --> 16:01.330
(sighs)

16:01.330 --> 16:02.858
What’s with you dumbbells?

16:02.858 --> 16:04.627
We were locked in here, Ed.

16:04.627 --> 16:05.825
Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Oh, yeah, I forgot,

16:05.825 --> 16:07.198
it’s busted.

16:07.198 --> 16:09.165
I was gonna get you
to fix that later.

16:09.165 --> 16:12.099
Oh, look at this. Bonnie’s gonna
love her new collection.

16:12.099 --> 16:14.792
New? Well, aren’t these hers?

16:14.792 --> 16:16.792
No, no, no, no. No, j-just one
of them. One of them is.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.297
Uh, where’d the rest of them
come from?

16:18.297 --> 16:20.792
Oh, so this old lady died
and they were in her attic.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.891
You’d be surprised
how little I paid for them.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.924
No, I wouldn’t.

16:25.924 --> 16:28.165
Bonnie’s always loved her doll.

16:28.165 --> 16:30.627
So, I thought, what’s better
than one doll, right?

16:30.627 --> 16:33.264
Uh, zero dolls.

16:33.264 --> 16:35.825
I mean, so,
so this is the wedding gift?

16:35.825 --> 16:37.759
Yes, yes.
I can’t wait to see her face.

16:37.759 --> 16:40.330
Oh, Ed, I’m-a do you
a favor, man. Um...

16:40.330 --> 16:43.429
-Okay, just for a second,
pretend you’re Bonnie.
-Yep?

16:43.429 --> 16:46.759
-What?
-Come on,
just-just pretend you’re Bonnie.

16:46.759 --> 16:49.429
-Uh...
-Who-who should I be?

16:50.462 --> 16:52.924
You should be quiet.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.825
-Okay, come on, I’m Bonnie.
Now what?
-Okay, okay, okay.

16:54.825 --> 16:56.594
-Um, okay, now...
-Yeah...

16:56.594 --> 16:58.165
-All right.
-...close your eyes.

16:58.165 --> 16:59.627
-Oh, close your eyes.
-All right.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.627
Now, imagine the man
you are about to marry

17:02.627 --> 17:04.957
-says he has a surprise for you.
-Mm-hmm.

17:04.957 --> 17:10.099
He says he created a room
in his big house just for you.

17:10.099 --> 17:13.297
-Mm-hmm.
-He leads you in here...

17:13.297 --> 17:17.858
-Mm-hmm.
-...you open your eyes, and...

17:22.033 --> 17:24.660
Jumping Jeffrey Dahmer.

17:24.660 --> 17:27.000
Oh...

17:30.297 --> 17:31.528
(exhales)

17:31.528 --> 17:33.495
Uh, yeah,
it’s-it’s not too late, Ed.

17:33.495 --> 17:35.825
We’ll just, uh, grab the doll
that belongs to Bonnie,

17:35.825 --> 17:37.264
we’ll put the rest in boxes

17:37.264 --> 17:38.660
and we’ll turn this
into a sewing room.

17:38.660 --> 17:40.198
I don’t know
which one is Bonnie’s. I...

17:40.198 --> 17:41.792
-Um...
-Look, you guys
figure it out, okay?

17:41.792 --> 17:44.231
I am out of here.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.594
Oops.

17:48.594 --> 17:50.264
DOLL:
Let’s play a game.

17:50.264 --> 17:52.330
(grunts)

17:56.033 --> 17:58.594
All right, gather, everybody,
for the big reveal.

17:58.594 --> 18:02.165
Let’s do this.
Um, uh, where is Vanessa?

18:02.165 --> 18:05.198
I haven’t seen her.
I think maybe she’s hurt.

18:05.198 --> 18:06.825
Maybe she thought
her husband should have

18:06.825 --> 18:09.198
a higher opinion of her
than he apparently does.

18:09.198 --> 18:12.693
(clears throat)
Interesting theory.

18:12.693 --> 18:14.363
-(loud boom)
-(Vanessa shouts)

18:14.363 --> 18:16.528
VANESSA:
Damn you, Mike Baxter!

18:16.528 --> 18:19.099
Yes!

18:19.099 --> 18:21.000
-What was that?
-Oh, that explosion

18:21.000 --> 18:24.231
was the sweet sound
of me being right.

18:25.462 --> 18:26.627
Whoa!

18:26.627 --> 18:28.693
(Mike laughing)

18:28.693 --> 18:30.066
(gasps)

18:31.495 --> 18:33.297
You know what? You probably
thought that if you looked

18:33.297 --> 18:35.528
in that cannon, you’d get
the gender of the baby?

18:35.528 --> 18:37.825
Maybe.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.330
What you didn’t know
was that I rigged it to explode,

18:40.330 --> 18:42.198
-Right.
-’cause... knowing you’d do
just that, because you are

18:42.198 --> 18:45.165
the childish, immature woman
that I fell in love with.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.264
Oh. I’m the grandmother.
I should be the first to know.

18:47.264 --> 18:51.000
-Oh, honey.
-I mean, who even
are all these people?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.264
Uh, well, we’re the parents.

18:54.264 --> 18:56.099
Uh, so Mom’s green.

18:56.099 --> 18:59.594
Does that mean that we’re having
a little baby lizard?

18:59.594 --> 19:01.000
No, no, that was just a trap.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
The glitter cannon
was just a diversion.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.594
A green herring, if you will.

19:05.594 --> 19:09.264
(laughs)

19:09.264 --> 19:14.099
It’s got everything you need
with a joke: a color and a fish.

19:14.099 --> 19:16.264
All right, all right. Can we,
can we just get on with this?

19:16.264 --> 19:17.528
And everyone, stop staring.

19:17.528 --> 19:19.297
I’m green, all right?
Get over it.

19:19.297 --> 19:20.858
Yeah, yeah,
let’s get this thing going.

19:20.858 --> 19:24.198
I want to find out if I’m gonna
be an aunt or an uncle.

19:24.198 --> 19:27.660
Listen, the gender reveal
is a big honor.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.825
And who better
to have that honor

19:29.825 --> 19:32.759
than the baby’s
big brother? Yeah?

19:32.759 --> 19:35.396
-Thanks, Grandpa.
-It’s right there.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.528
It’s snowing.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.825
Oh! Oh! Pink snow!

19:43.825 --> 19:45.528
Honey, it’s a girl.

19:45.528 --> 19:47.429
-It’s a girl.
-We’re having a girl.

19:47.429 --> 19:50.759
Finally, a soprano
to harmonize with.

19:52.099 --> 19:55.462
Kyle, Kyle,
I wouldn’t eat any of that snow.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.132
It was suspiciously cheap.

19:57.132 --> 19:59.528
Honey...

19:59.528 --> 20:00.957
Are you, are you excited

20:00.957 --> 20:02.594
about getting
your first granddaughter?

20:02.594 --> 20:06.099
Yes, I am, and also about being
married to Swamp Thing.

20:06.099 --> 20:08.000
(laughs)

20:08.000 --> 20:09.660
Well, I hope this baby
doesn’t inherit

20:09.660 --> 20:12.330
my need to know every secret.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.924
-Well, I hope it does.
-Hmm...

20:13.924 --> 20:16.099
-And everything else.
-Aw.

20:17.429 --> 20:19.033
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.165
Mmm...

20:21.165 --> 20:22.660
(Kristin laughs)

20:22.660 --> 20:26.066
Now this, I got to get
a picture of.

20:32.627 --> 20:34.594
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

20:34.594 --> 20:37.033
(chuckles) My kid is about
to have another kid,

20:37.033 --> 20:39.495
which makes me think about
the little one’s adventures,

20:39.495 --> 20:41.924
and the ones I had
when I was a kid.

20:41.924 --> 20:45.198
Learning the hard way bedsheets
make a lousy parachute.

20:45.198 --> 20:47.957
12 feet off the garage
didn’t seem like that much,

20:47.957 --> 20:51.165
but in free fall? Ouch.

20:51.165 --> 20:54.165
Skinny-dipping in a river
so cold my buddy Matt Clark

20:54.165 --> 20:58.000
got freezer burn on his nuts.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.858
Or the time Archie Harris pushed
me off my bike, broke my arm.

21:00.858 --> 21:03.693
I asked him to sign my cast,
then I clubbed him with it.

21:03.693 --> 21:06.858
(laughs)
The point is, we did stuff.

21:06.858 --> 21:09.363
And sure, most of it
was injuring each other,

21:09.363 --> 21:13.099
but we weren’t just watching
life or taking pictures of it.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.297
Life was all the amazing things
that happened

21:15.297 --> 21:18.165
between trips
to the emergency room.

21:18.165 --> 21:21.132
Now, thanks to the Gram,
Snapchat and TikTok,

21:21.132 --> 21:22.759
I worry that
the future generations,

21:22.759 --> 21:24.429
like my granddaughter’s,

21:24.429 --> 21:27.429
won’t even know how to look
each other in the eye.

21:27.429 --> 21:29.858
If you can’t look
each other in the eye,

21:29.858 --> 21:31.858
how the hell are you gonna
hit someone in the throat

21:31.858 --> 21:33.561
with your slingshot?

21:35.495 --> 21:37.264
Baxter out.

21:38.759 --> 21:40.198
(chicken clucks)

21:40.198 --> 21:42.264
