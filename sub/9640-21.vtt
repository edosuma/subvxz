00:07.803 --> 00:11.145
Oh my gosh, that was so much fun.
I love silent movies.

00:11.180 --> 00:14.153
Although it wasn't very silent
with Alex talking the whole time.

00:14.187 --> 00:16.458
Uh, silent movies are the worst.

00:16.492 --> 00:18.025
It's not that hard to go back

00:18.060 --> 00:19.886
and put some voices in the movie.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.051
I mean, people do it all
the time on the Internet.

00:22.252 --> 00:26.218
The other day, I saw Big
Bird doing a Kanye West song.

00:30.521 --> 00:32.054
Justin, don't listen to her.

00:32.522 --> 00:35.158
She could never appreciate the
subtle nuances of Laurel and Hardy.

00:35.192 --> 00:38.095
Oh, how about when they were
pushing that piano up the stairs?

00:38.129 --> 00:40.732
You knew it was coming down,
but you just didn't know when.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.132
Genius.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.399
No, it was two idiots
moving something

00:45.434 --> 00:48.198
they should have paid someone
else to move for them.

00:48.232 --> 00:51.897
It's like that time you and Dad tried to
push the dishwasher up the fire escape.

00:51.932 --> 00:54.232
We had to buy a new fire
escape and a new dishwasher.

00:54.267 --> 00:56.435
She's just jealous.

00:56.469 --> 00:59.639
She doesn't think it's a movie unless
there's a car crash every five minutes.

00:59.673 --> 01:02.376
Hey,  Car Crash Every Five
Minutes  was a great movie.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.712
Yeah, you knew the car was going to crash,
and you knew exactly when.

01:05.746 --> 01:07.613
Genius.

01:07.647 --> 01:09.548
That's a good one.

01:09.883 --> 01:13.418
Oh, Harper, the silent movie festival runs
all week. We should go catch another film.

01:13.452 --> 01:15.419
That's a great idea.

01:15.453 --> 01:18.519
Wait, you guys are going
to the movies without me?

01:18.553 --> 01:21.786
You obviously don't like silent
movies and we're really into them.

01:21.821 --> 01:25.323
We should go see one of the
Charlie Chaplin comedies tomorrow.

01:25.357 --> 01:26.724
Oh, that sounds great.

01:28.493 --> 01:31.627
How can you call them comedies
if you can't hear the joke?

01:31.662 --> 01:34.563
You don't need dialogue
for a comedy to be funny.

01:34.597 --> 01:37.699
Oh, really? Well then
let's see about that.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.907 --> 01:48.207
I rest my case.

01:53.078 --> 01:54.878
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:55.480 --> 01:56.780
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

01:57.415 --> 01:58.982
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

01:59.017 --> 02:00.617
* Yes, please *

02:00.651 --> 02:02.452
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:02.985 --> 02:04.252
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:04.986 --> 02:06.587
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:06.621 --> 02:08.420
* That's what I said *

02:08.455 --> 02:11.756
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:11.790 --> 02:15.392
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:15.426 --> 02:18.962
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:18.996 --> 02:23.833
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

02:23.867 --> 02:26.970
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:27.004 --> 02:30.772
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:30.807 --> 02:34.611
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:34.645 --> 02:38.481
* Because everything is not *

02:38.515 --> 02:41.049
* What it seems *

02:48.656 --> 02:50.990
You made this sandwich
with mayo on it.

02:51.258 --> 02:54.426
Come on, Jerry, you're making me look
bad out there. I wrote down,  no mayo.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.795
Well this says,  plus mayo.

02:56.829 --> 03:00.164
That's an  X . X  means no mayo.

03:00.198 --> 03:02.832
Why don't you just write  no mayo?

03:02.867 --> 03:07.870
Can't bring in a Navy code cracker
every time you turn in an order.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.041
Just fix the sandwich.

03:12.075 --> 03:14.209
This is New York.
People want stuff fast.

03:14.244 --> 03:16.578
If you were a superhero
your name would be

03:16.613 --> 03:19.114
Super Slow Sandwich Making Guy."

03:20.516 --> 03:22.049
And you'd be my sidekick.

03:22.084 --> 03:24.584
Wonder How She Ever
Became A Waitress Woman.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.220
You don't quite understand
what I do back here.

03:28.255 --> 03:30.722
There's a lot more to it
than just making sandwiches.

03:30.757 --> 03:33.791
I have to get the supplies,
do all the prep work,

03:33.826 --> 03:36.460
make the orders and deal
with a wisecracking waitress.

03:36.561 --> 03:40.930
Oh, I would love to see you do my job
dealing with customers for a day.

03:40.965 --> 03:42.865
There's a reason
you're back here Jerry.

03:42.899 --> 03:44.632
People don't like sweaty waiters.

03:44.666 --> 03:45.866
There, I said it!

03:48.036 --> 03:50.703
Hey, why don't you
guys just switch jobs?

03:50.738 --> 03:53.906
That way you can see how hard it
is to do the other person's work.

03:53.941 --> 03:57.843
Oh. Well, I don't know.
Your mom's job seems pretty tough.

03:57.877 --> 03:59.911
I mean, you have to write
down what people want.

03:59.946 --> 04:02.347
And then later,
you have to bring it to them.

04:02.381 --> 04:05.449
I can totally do your job!
And I can smile.

04:05.483 --> 04:07.484
They won't be used to that.

04:07.518 --> 04:10.353
Oh, bring it on.

04:10.387 --> 04:14.556
I'll sit back here where no one can see me
and stuff a bunch of meat into slices of
bread.

04:14.590 --> 04:16.156
But I'll get it right.

04:16.192 --> 04:17.759
Stuffing?

04:17.793 --> 04:19.761
This is an art.

04:19.795 --> 04:23.998
They don't just give these Sandwich
University diplomas away to just anybody.

04:24.032 --> 04:27.835
I made you that for Father's Day.

04:28.903 --> 04:31.304
I still earned it.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.445
Hey Alex, the movie was so good.

04:40.479 --> 04:41.446
Awesome.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.282
Matching t-shirts?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.483
Oh, are they having a field
trip at school today?

04:45.518 --> 04:47.853
Don't worry. You won't get lost.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.325
They're prizes.

04:53.593 --> 04:57.862
We knew the most Chaplin
trivia. Jealous?

04:57.897 --> 05:01.931
Yes. I'm jealous of other people, because
they're not a part of this conversation.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.467
- She's jealous.
- Uh-huh.

05:04.968 --> 05:07.336
Harper, don't forget about the
Lon Chaney silent movie tomorrow.

05:07.370 --> 05:11.171
We can't miss that. I'll make us shirts
that say we like our festivals...

05:11.206 --> 05:12.239
...silent.

05:18.077 --> 05:19.143
Oh...

05:19.178 --> 05:21.579
I'm gonna go.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.048
No, Harper.

05:24.082 --> 05:26.250
Forget about the stupid
movie with Justin.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.751
Let's go to the bowling alley

05:27.785 --> 05:29.452
and rent shoes just to eat pizza.

05:29.987 --> 05:32.455
And then when the guy behind the
counter threatens to call the cops,

05:32.489 --> 05:36.891
we'll say "Do it, cause we'd like to get
a ticket for wearing bowling shoes."

05:36.926 --> 05:40.727
I can't. Tonight's the night my mom
and dad and I pick out a kitten.

05:40.761 --> 05:44.664
Now that things are great at home,
Doctor Paul says it's safe for animals.

05:48.767 --> 05:49.801
Sorry.

05:51.803 --> 05:53.771
I don't want you dating Harper.

05:54.105 --> 05:57.373
It could upset the delicate balance of
who I can pit against whom in my life.

05:57.408 --> 05:59.240
I'm not dating Harper.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.874
Oh, come on.

06:00.909 --> 06:03.277
You make plans.
You go to the movies.

06:03.311 --> 06:05.579
She walks you home. That's a date.

06:05.613 --> 06:07.547
Wait a second.
I know what you're doing.

06:07.815 --> 06:10.383
It's a scare tactic to get me
to stop hanging out with Harper.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.285
Oh, really?

06:12.520 --> 06:17.022
Because one time when you were napping on
the couch, she stared at you for an hour.

06:17.057 --> 06:20.258
What? You let her stare...

06:20.292 --> 06:21.726
You know, it's not working.

06:21.827 --> 06:23.660
Harper and I just
like the same movies.

06:24.395 --> 06:27.996
And she's kinda fun now that she's not
acting like some freak who has a crazy
crush on me.

06:28.031 --> 06:31.299
OK, but that freak is living right
under the surface so stop dating her.

06:31.334 --> 06:33.666
We're not dating!

06:33.701 --> 06:35.234
But, you know what?

06:35.569 --> 06:38.671
It looks like it bugs you, so hey,
why don't we call it a date.

06:38.705 --> 06:40.739
With a capital "D."

06:43.075 --> 06:44.442
Oh!

06:52.685 --> 06:54.885
Yeah, I just found
out in Career Class

06:55.053 --> 06:58.155
that you only need to go to
school 40 hours to become a pilot.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.091
I totally have that kinda time.

07:01.125 --> 07:04.960
Dude, you've never even been in a plane.
They're not gonna let you fly one.

07:04.995 --> 07:09.596
You were 40 hours away from me
asking you to be my co-pilot.

07:13.333 --> 07:17.969
Oh, Harper, there's a lecture tonight by
the guy who helped Buster Keaton do his own
stunts.

07:18.003 --> 07:21.238
Wow, so a billion year old guy
is going to talk about falling?

07:21.272 --> 07:23.339
Why don't you just go
hang out with Grandpa?

07:25.108 --> 07:28.277
Oh, Justin, don't listen to her.
Count me in.

07:28.312 --> 07:30.612
OK. Can't wait.

07:32.848 --> 07:37.018
So where's Justin taking you
to dinner before the movie?

07:37.052 --> 07:39.520
He didn't say
anything about dinner.

07:39.555 --> 07:42.657
Well, yeah. No, I know.
But I mean, you've been out a few times.

07:42.692 --> 07:47.662
Dinner and a movie, it's kinda what
people do when they're on a... date.

07:48.997 --> 07:51.198
Date?

07:51.232 --> 07:53.800
Oh my gosh. You're right.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.535
I am dating Justin.

07:55.569 --> 07:57.870
I never thought it
would happen like this.

07:57.905 --> 08:01.673
By accident.

08:06.544 --> 08:07.944
Oh, hey Justin. How ya doing?

08:08.079 --> 08:10.179
Have you ever noticed,

08:10.280 --> 08:13.148
that you and silent film star Rudolph
Valentino have a lot in common?

08:13.183 --> 08:15.717
You're both half-Italian,
you both worked in a restaurant.

08:15.852 --> 08:18.119
Although you're not a dancer.
But if you were a dancer,

08:18.554 --> 08:21.021
I'd come to one of your shows.
Are you having a show? Cause I would go.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.891
Would I make you nervous
if I sat up front?

08:24.925 --> 08:26.558
I hope it's Grease.
Cause I love Rizzo

08:26.593 --> 08:28.293
and I hate Sandy.

08:41.503 --> 08:43.437
Nice going, Alex.

08:43.672 --> 08:47.307
I know you did something to Harper to
make her act all "Creepy Harper" again.

08:47.342 --> 08:50.376
Hey, everything's back
to the way it should be.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.910
I'm her best friend.
She weirds you out. You're mad at me.

08:52.944 --> 08:55.044
And she watches you sleep.
Everybody's happy.

08:55.078 --> 08:59.515
No. I liked hanging out with
a girl that's just a friend.

08:59.549 --> 09:02.184
Relax, you still have Mom.

09:02.219 --> 09:04.687
The point is you
sabotaged our friendship

09:04.721 --> 09:07.189
just because you didn't want
me hanging out with her.

09:07.223 --> 09:09.224
It was a nice break
from my other friends

09:09.258 --> 09:11.492
where most of our
conversations are about

09:11.527 --> 09:13.294
"Actroid the Japanese Fembot."

09:21.904 --> 09:25.706
Here's your Number
Four with no tomatoes.

09:27.442 --> 09:32.379
Whoa. What did you do?
Stuff the whole cow in here?

09:32.413 --> 09:35.248
Excuse me for putting a
little meat in the sandwiches

09:35.282 --> 09:36.949
instead of just rubbing
it on the bread.

09:45.593 --> 09:47.859
Now, where do these go?

09:49.926 --> 09:52.426
Dad, didn't you write down the
table number on the order?

09:52.460 --> 09:54.394
That would help.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.229
Look, Max, can you figure
out who ordered these?

09:57.263 --> 10:00.633
Dad, I don't want to get in the
middle of your competition with Mom.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.171
I understand, son.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.640
But for five dollars
you will, right?

10:08.675 --> 10:11.042
I do need money for flight school.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.646
Uh, OK.

10:16.681 --> 10:18.381
Mom. I need a Brooklyn Bridge.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.316
OK. What's in that?

10:20.351 --> 10:22.684
Two pastrami sandwiches
connected by a hot dog.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.419
Who orders that?

10:24.454 --> 10:27.522
The guy that started
out with dessert.

10:28.991 --> 10:31.225
Max, listen, you've got to help me.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.560
I don't know how your dad
keeps track of all of this.

10:33.595 --> 10:36.129
Listen, Mom, I like you,
I really do.

10:36.164 --> 10:39.398
But this is between you and Dad.
I don't want to get involved.

10:39.432 --> 10:42.367
All right, I understand, Max.

10:42.401 --> 10:47.337
But, I could get involved
for the right price.

10:47.371 --> 10:49.338
Oh, really?

10:49.372 --> 10:52.206
OK, here.

10:52.241 --> 10:54.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa Mom.
Don't make it so obvious.

10:58.212 --> 11:02.582
Oh. Look, someone must have dropped
a five dollar bill on the floor.

11:04.785 --> 11:06.286
OK, now help me!

11:07.621 --> 11:10.090
I messed up on all
of these sandwiches.

11:10.124 --> 11:12.158
All right, when you
mess up on a sandwich

11:12.459 --> 11:15.961
here's the sponge Dad uses to clean
the condiments off the bread.

11:15.995 --> 11:19.197
He calls it "The Eraser."

11:19.231 --> 11:20.699
Thank you.

11:20.733 --> 11:23.001
Oh.

11:23.035 --> 11:26.370
I think you know a
better way to thank me.

11:26.405 --> 11:27.905
Just fix those sandwiches.

11:27.939 --> 11:29.139
OK.

11:39.481 --> 11:43.083
Harper, what are you doing out here?
Why don't you just go in?

11:43.118 --> 11:46.854
I am never going in there ever again.
Justin cancelled on the Buster Keaton
lecture,

11:46.888 --> 11:48.755
and then when I tried
to make other plans,

11:48.990 --> 11:50.590
he said he w busy for
the rest of the year.

11:50.624 --> 11:52.558
Harper, you'll get over it.

11:52.592 --> 11:54.860
Let's go inside and I'll
make you some hot chocolate.

11:54.894 --> 11:56.662
Hey, wait a second.

11:56.696 --> 11:59.297
You're being awfully
nonchalant about all this.

11:59.332 --> 12:03.266
What are you talking about?
I'm being totally "chalant."

12:03.301 --> 12:06.202
Did you say something to Justin?

12:06.236 --> 12:09.605
Did you tell him about tt one
time I watched him sleep?

12:10.740 --> 12:12.975
You did, didn't you?

12:14.277 --> 12:16.377
That could be
misconstrued as creepy.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.881
C'mon, Harper. We're back to normal.
Back to normal's good.

12:20.915 --> 12:23.650
Alex, you're a pretty controlling
person and I put up with it

12:23.684 --> 12:25.185
because you're my best friend.

12:25.219 --> 12:27.053
But you knew how I
felt about Justin

12:27.722 --> 12:30.824
and you couldn't just be okay with it.
What kind of best friend does this stuff?

12:30.858 --> 12:34.995
Okay, maybe I didn't think it all the way
through, but you know what I was going for.

12:35.029 --> 12:37.296
You know what?
I don't need an answer.

12:37.331 --> 12:39.331
This is the kind of
question you hear now,

12:39.499 --> 12:41.866
and think about later when I
leave in a huff. Which is now.

12:44.903 --> 12:46.670
So you are going to
think about it, right?

12:46.705 --> 12:47.838
I...

13:01.047 --> 13:03.048
Mom, I need to talk to you.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.717
Oh, can it wait, Alex? I'm finally
getting caught up on these orders.

13:06.752 --> 13:10.020
Aren't you the one who always says,

13:10.054 --> 13:13.390
"I always have time for you and
whatever problems you're having?"

13:13.424 --> 13:16.625
That is you, right? Mother.

13:18.495 --> 13:20.362
What is it, sweetie?

13:20.497 --> 13:23.632
Two people very close to me are having
a problem, and I tried to fix it,

13:23.666 --> 13:26.701
but I might have made it worse
for everybody, especially me.

13:26.735 --> 13:28.769
Well, if you truly care about them

13:28.803 --> 13:31.171
you'll need to put their
feelings above yours.

13:31.205 --> 13:33.039
Do you know where Dad is?

13:33.941 --> 13:36.008
Let me finish.

13:36.043 --> 13:39.945
Get them in a room together and don't
let them leave until they work it out.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.348
All right, that's
actually not a bad idea.

13:43.382 --> 13:45.583
They'll be friends again,
they won't be mad at me,

13:45.818 --> 13:48.119
and I don't have to apologize
to anyone. Thanks, Mom.

13:48.153 --> 13:50.888
Oh, nice job pretending like
you wanted to talk to me.

13:50.922 --> 13:52.189
OK, sweetie.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.332
I'm here. What do you want?

14:09.367 --> 14:12.370
I wanted to talk to you about this
whole mess. Here, grab a soda.

14:12.404 --> 14:15.839
I'm gonna take out the garbage.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.148
What do you want, Alex?

14:28.315 --> 14:29.649
I don't have time for anything.

14:29.884 --> 14:32.219
Ah! Justin! You're not
supposed to be here!

14:32.254 --> 14:36.123
It's my house. You're
not supposed to be here.

14:39.626 --> 14:42.994
Make your troubles no more,
go in through the out door.

14:43.029 --> 14:44.729
Why are you here?! Oh,
I have to go.

14:46.765 --> 14:47.899
Harper.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.333
Um!

14:53.537 --> 14:55.138
Whoa!

14:55.172 --> 14:56.572
What's going on?

14:56.606 --> 14:59.441
I don't watch you
when you sleep. Bye!

15:04.213 --> 15:06.480
Stop following me.

15:08.548 --> 15:09.581
Hang on, Harper.

15:13.519 --> 15:16.486
Alex must have cast the "In
Through the Out Door" spell.

15:16.521 --> 15:18.954
We can't leave without
coming right back in.

15:18.989 --> 15:21.089
I should've known.

15:21.124 --> 15:23.725
She said she was going
to take the garbage out.

15:23.759 --> 15:26.160
She never takes the garbage out.

15:26.194 --> 15:27.795
Why would she do this?

15:28.130 --> 15:31.098
Because she's evil and probably
wanted us to be friends again.

15:31.132 --> 15:34.568
Well, she's not gonna
get away with it.

15:34.602 --> 15:36.770
Yeah. We gotta get
back at her for this.

15:36.804 --> 15:39.072
- We should use magic.
- Yes!

15:39.106 --> 15:41.774
We can make her really tiny and
chase her around with a vacuum.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.508
My new kitty hates that.
Or we could...

15:43.543 --> 15:45.544
Whoa! That's...

15:45.578 --> 15:48.012
You've obviously been learning
about magic from Alex.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.081
All magic isn't devious
and manipulative.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.382
Really?

15:51.416 --> 15:53.350
Then what's so great
about being a wizard?

15:54.752 --> 15:57.521
Alex did the "In Through
The Out Door" spell, right?

15:57.555 --> 16:00.790
But she probably wasn't smart
enough to put a "spell lock" on it.

16:02.059 --> 16:03.159
Alex always wrecks it.

16:03.193 --> 16:05.928
Make this door an exit.

16:11.799 --> 16:14.635
We're free.

16:14.669 --> 16:18.038
We gotta get back at her with something
that we know she hates. Something...

16:18.072 --> 16:19.406
Something bad.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.341
Silent movies!

16:21.375 --> 16:24.110
Or books! Yeah! She hates books.

16:24.145 --> 16:26.545
We can just get a bunch of
books and throw them at her.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.247
Ooh, hardcover.

16:39.224 --> 16:41.057
Payback time.

16:41.092 --> 16:42.957
Yes, it is.

16:42.992 --> 16:46.058
Alex, you're about to star
in your own silent film.

16:46.093 --> 16:47.493
Take away color and sound,

16:47.527 --> 16:49.294
this is where revenge is found.

19:37.156 --> 19:38.923
That was awful.

19:38.957 --> 19:41.491
I'm gonna go lie down.

19:41.525 --> 19:44.327
I'm exhausted from all that
running and overacting.

19:52.902 --> 19:54.503
Listen, Harper.

19:54.537 --> 19:57.238
I had a good time at the
silent movie festival with you.

19:57.273 --> 20:00.809
And just because the festival is over,
it doesn't mean you and I can't...

20:00.843 --> 20:03.010
You know, go catch a
flick once in awhile.

20:03.044 --> 20:05.779
Oh, Justin. That'd be great.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.014
There's a festival
coming up in Florida.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.416
I can ask my mom if we can borrow her car.
And even if she says no,

20:11.185 --> 20:13.519
I'm willing to go on the run with you
despite the trouble it will bring me.

20:13.553 --> 20:16.355
Whoa... Harper.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.556
Right. I'll try and control myself.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.591
I'm probably more fun that way.

20:21.492 --> 20:23.026
Little bit.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.746
Dad, I can't help
you this afternoon.

20:44.780 --> 20:46.614
Because I quit.

20:46.648 --> 20:48.882
What? Why?

20:48.916 --> 20:51.317
Are you in a play?

20:51.352 --> 20:55.086
No, look. I just wanted to raise enough
money so I can go to flight school,

20:55.120 --> 20:59.622
but they told me when I got down there,
that it was gonna be 5,000 dollars.

20:59.657 --> 21:02.425
So I bought this suit instead.

21:04.829 --> 21:09.465
But you can't quit. I need you. Your mom is
on the ropes. She is gonna crack.

21:11.468 --> 21:14.836
No, she's not. I've been doing
her job for her. She paid me.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.070
I should've known.

21:19.873 --> 21:23.108
So, you've been paying Max to
do your work for you? Ha ha!

21:23.142 --> 21:25.377
I win.

21:25.411 --> 21:27.778
But Dad, you've
also been paying me.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.348
So you've been taking advantage
of our son for your own benefit?

21:32.383 --> 21:35.418
What kind of irresponsible
parent does that?

21:35.452 --> 21:37.719
Or lets him dress
up like a doorman.

21:39.021 --> 21:40.154
I'm a pilot.

21:42.389 --> 21:45.724
You know, you guys need to realize
that both of your jobs are hard. OK?

21:45.758 --> 21:47.826
You should really
appreciate each other more.

21:49.762 --> 21:52.163
Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:52.198 --> 21:55.036
I need to go practice
my pilot talk.

21:58.475 --> 22:01.512
Flight attendants, please
prepare the cabin for take off.

22:02.247 --> 22:03.915
Bing-bong.

22:20.901 --> 22:22.568
What can I get for you?

22:22.569 --> 22:29.569
