37:19.111 --> 37:20.863
{\an8}I don't know if I can
handle this right now.

I'm the ass[bleep]. Alright?

37:34.961 --> 37:37.338
Just so you know.

{\an7}Like, I'm gonna move on.
Like, you know what I mean?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.478
{\an7}Whether it's with or without you
at this point. Like, you know?

37:59.944 --> 38:01.237
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, absolutely.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.698
I-I brought home
[bleep] mad girls.

<i>When I give you flowers</i>

38:06.409 --> 38:08.494
{\an7}don't ask me
if I brought home a girl.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.915
{\an7}Ron, I'm just trying
to talk to you, like, normally.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.876
{\an1}<i>(Sammi)</i>
<i>Ah. He got me flowers.</i>

38:15.960 --> 38:18.337

- Hello.
- Yeah. What's up?

38:22.883 --> 38:24.260
Why are you being mean to me?

{\an1}'Every time I try talking to
you, you're, like, ignoring me.'

38:28.139 --> 38:30.141
{\an1}'And why would you get me
flowers if you wanna ignore me?'

38:30.224 --> 38:31.017
{\an1}'Like, thank you.
I'm trying to say thank you.'

38:31.100 --> 38:33.310
'And you won't even let me.'

38:35.646 --> 38:36.647
{\an1}Uh...

38:37.815 --> 38:39.317
Every time
I try to talk to you--

38:39.400 --> 38:41.736
So find somebody
better than me.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.820
Call me in [bleep] four years

Oh, you're so...

38:46.615 --> 38:48.242
'Yeah, whatever. You, too.'

{\an1}You can tell somebody
to go [bleep] themselves

{\an1}"You're a piece of [bleep],
you're a scumbag"

38:54.790 --> 38:57.126
and see if they come home with
a [bleep] dozen roses for you.

38:57.209 --> 38:59.045
{\an1}- 'Can you just sit here?'
- And see how it goes.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.214
{\an8}What did I just do? Like, why
did I even get her the roses?

39:02.298 --> 39:04.175
{\an1}- Whatever, dude.
- Thank you for the flowers.
