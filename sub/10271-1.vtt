00:55.973 --> 00:58.307
I was reading
The Financial Times,

00:59.143 --> 01:01.811
and it was a little, tiny,
two-paragraph story that said,

01:01.895 --> 01:05.522
"Mankind may be causing
a mass-extinction event."

01:10.070 --> 01:11.821
It was, like, buried on like
page six or seven.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.905
And l thought,

01:13.115 --> 01:15.992
"This is how humanity
is dealing with the issue.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.620
"They're not dealing with it."

01:25.753 --> 01:27.086
Check your cellphone.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.506
If you get anywhere near this
place, he scrambles the signal.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.468
Louie, man ,
how are you?

01:34.052 --> 01:36.387
Just curious, how many cameras
do you have on you right now?

01:36.472 --> 01:37.722
You mean, like,
on my table or--

01:37.806 --> 01:38.848
No, no. On your body.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.974
On my body?

01:40.726 --> 01:42.435
Less than seven,
but probably more than two.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.732
Okay, so,
we're doing an order here.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.443
One hat cam,
two buttonhole cameras,

01:50.527 --> 01:55.656
sports bra, one bottle cam, 5. 1 1
tac shirt with the vibration .

01:56.033 --> 01:57.283
-Whenever you're ready.
-Oh , yeah .

01:57.367 --> 02:00.745
So you're rolling right now,
so you can get the entrance.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.663
And make sure, of course,
the straps are gone.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.915
Okay.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.709
Your reservation's
in ten minutes.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.169
All right.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.969
So, we ate Codfish.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.937
Kobe beef and also
some sweet shrimp.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.240
I was raised on it.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.449
She brought me here.

02:40.786 --> 02:41.994
Yeah .

02:42.079 --> 02:43.746
We try to be
adventurous, yeah.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.916
I started eating it
like ten years ago.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.381
l've been having sashimi
a lot at my grandpa's.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.507
-Oh , yeah .
-We would go out.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.309
Thank you .

03:08.063 --> 03:10.356
This is a special
tamari soy sauce from the chef.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.984
l don't know.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.485
Yeah, three pieces. We got it.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.821
It's a bingo.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.117
The owners and chef of one of
America's trendiest restaurants. . .

03:21.201 --> 03:23.661
. . .are facing federal charges
tonight,

03:23.745 --> 03:26.789
all because of what they
put on customers' plates.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.541
An endangered species.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.293
And behind the undercover sting,

03:30.586 --> 03:33.379
some movie makers
who went right back to work.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.309
We're making
our own road here.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.062
Pretty big, the side
of the skull here, yeah.

03:50.689 --> 03:54.066
I did four stories
about extinction for

03:54.151 --> 03:55.234
National Geographic magazine.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.907
You go to these
beautiful landscapes.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.912
There's dinosaurs
from horizon to horizon.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.794
And you think,
"That was so far back then,

04:15.213 --> 04:19.007
"what if it's going on right now
and everybody's missing it?"

04:22.220 --> 04:25.556
Each year,
about one in a million species

04:25.641 --> 04:27.433
should expire naturally.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.937
In the next few decades,

04:31.271 --> 04:33.439
we'll be driving species
to extinction...

04:33.523 --> 04:36.067
...a thousand times faster
than they should be.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.778
It's difficult to estimate

04:38.862 --> 04:41.989
precisely how many species
we're gonna lose.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.116
In a hundred years or so,

04:44.493 --> 04:47.954
we could lose up to 50%
of all the species on Earth.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.041
I remember thinking,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.543
"This is the biggest story
in the world."

04:56.797 --> 04:58.631
It's like we're living
in the age of dinosaurs,

04:59.341 --> 05:01.258
but we can do something
about it.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.618
A friend of mine just
reported up in that area.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.995
Roger.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.163
The blue whale
is the biggest creature

05:31.248 --> 05:32.873
that ever lived on the planet.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.750
Bigger than any dinosaur ever.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.130
Just like dinosaurs,
they're going extinct.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.840
It's coming in hot!

05:40.924 --> 05:42.216
There it is!

05:43.635 --> 05:44.844
Look at him.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.262
Back in the days of whaling,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.016
they were hunted
to near-extinction,

05:50.392 --> 05:52.601
down to about two percent
of their population.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.896
Now they're getting decimated
by shipping traffic.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.648
Go for it.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.567
He's coming up to the right.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.693
To the right.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.903
My hope is that
if you can show people

06:02.988 --> 06:05.197
the beauty of these animals,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.367
there's a chance
to save these things.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.055
One of the cool things
about a blue whale

06:29.848 --> 06:32.725
is that it has the loudest song
in the animal kingdom,

06:33.310 --> 06:34.560
but you can't hear it,

06:35.645 --> 06:37.772
because it's below
our threshold for hearing.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.779
We look out at the world through
these eyes and these ears,

06:44.863 --> 06:46.280
and you think, "Oh, that's it.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.949
"That's everything
that there is to see."

06:52.662 --> 06:55.247
But there's this hidden world
on almost every level.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.711
What I want to do is
get people to see it.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.989
We get off the boat,

07:29.616 --> 07:32.535
and this fisherman comes up
to our interpreter

07:32.619 --> 07:34.829
and says, "Can you give me $500?

07:34.913 --> 07:37.289
"I found this buoy.
There's a $500 reward.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.583
"lt needs to be returned
up to America."

07:42.212 --> 07:43.337
And I said, "Just a minute.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.463
"Let me take a look
at this buoy."

07:45.882 --> 07:47.967
And I look at it, and it says,

07:48.051 --> 07:50.928
"Return to Chris Clark,
Cornell Bioacoustic laboratory."

07:51.012 --> 07:52.138
I said, "I know this guy."

07:58.937 --> 08:01.981
Chris had been pioneering
new ways to record whales

08:02.065 --> 08:03.107
for 30 years.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.402
He basically proved
that these animals

08:06.486 --> 08:08.320
could hear themselves
across oceans.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.575
And so, to me,
finding that buoy

08:12.659 --> 08:14.076
was like finding a message
in a bottle.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.790
We built these
recording systems.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.295
We dropped them in the ocean,
and they record continuously.

08:25.714 --> 08:29.675
Whales and dolphins
and anything that's out there...

08:29.759 --> 08:31.051
we try and record.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.014
So, the first time,

08:35.472 --> 08:38.976
I knew there was a blue whale
singing nearby.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.438
l could see it on the display,
but I couldn't hear it.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.194
So what do you have to do?
You have to speed it up.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.158
And still, the hair goes up
on the back of my neck,

08:54.367 --> 08:55.618
and it just, like-- It's like,

08:56.286 --> 08:58.329
"Damn! That's fabulous."

09:05.420 --> 09:07.379
As we listen more and more

09:07.464 --> 09:09.256
around different parts
of the planet,

09:11.760 --> 09:15.429
whether it's frozen Arctic ocean

09:15.889 --> 09:19.808
or the deepest jungles
of Central Africa,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.228
the whole world is singing.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.066
Clicking and grinding
and whistling and thumping.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.653
But we've stopped listening.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.746
The Cornell Bioacoustical Laboratory

09:40.830 --> 09:44.208
has the largest repository
of animal sounds on the planet.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.295
They've been collecting them
since the 1 930s.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.548
You can think of it as a museum,

09:51.633 --> 09:53.759
just like there could be
bird skins or, you know,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.135
beetles tacked up on a wall.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.515
So there's this range of sounds

09:59.683 --> 10:02.643
from the largest animal
ever to live on this planet

10:03.770 --> 10:05.813
to the tiniest, little insects.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.735
This is a song recording

10:12.487 --> 10:15.364
of a male 'o'o singing
on Kaua'i.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.702
These birds mate for life,

10:20.328 --> 10:22.288
so he would be singing
a duet with his mate,

10:22.372 --> 10:25.082
where he sings, and then
she sings back and forth.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.378
Here comes the male's song.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.213
There's no response.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.050
Here's the male's song again.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.346
That's the last male of a species,

10:39.889 --> 10:41.473
singing for a female

10:42.475 --> 10:43.475
who will never come.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.314
He is totally alone.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.027
And now his voice is gone.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.907
In the brief lifetime
of this collection,

10:59.951 --> 11:01.076
70 years or so,

11:02.078 --> 11:05.748
many of the species that
were recorded are now extinct.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.003
So the repository
is a living example

11:11.087 --> 11:14.882
of the massive rate
of extinction that's happening.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.771
There's been five major extinctions
in the history of the planet.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.357
There's the Ordovician,

11:33.151 --> 11:34.234
the Devonian,

11:35.987 --> 11:37.237
the Permian...

11:38.990 --> 11:40.574
...there was the triassic-jurassic,

11:41.910 --> 11:43.452
...and then the K-t extinction,

11:44.245 --> 11:45.996
...the one that killed
the dinosaurs.

11:47.999 --> 11:51.210
It's very difficult
to comprehend deep time.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.630
You know, 4.6 billion years
of Earth's history.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.217
But if you take, say,
the history of the Earth

11:58.385 --> 12:00.761
and try to squeeze it into
a 24-hour clock,

12:02.305 --> 12:03.639
where does man fit
on that clock?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.976
A few seconds before midnight.
That's it.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.979
We're the new kid on the block.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.524
What we're seeing now...

12:14.692 --> 12:16.068
...is called the anthropocene,
the new epoch.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.155
Anthropocene means
the time of humans.

12:21.825 --> 12:25.661
It's when the impact of humans
is leaving itself as a mark

12:25.745 --> 12:27.538
in the fossil record
of the future.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.917
65 million years ago,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.837
there was an asteroid
that struck

12:34.921 --> 12:36.672
and caused the dinosaurs
to go extinct.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.509
When it comes to
the sixth extinction event,

12:40.969 --> 12:45.055
we have no problem
identifying the cause.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.101
Humanity has become the asteroid.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.524
We're on that tipping point now,

12:56.025 --> 12:57.734
where it's either...

12:58.778 --> 13:01.655
too late or just the beginning
of a movement.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.576
So, there's two pieces
of whale and one piece of horse.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.994
At the Hump restaurant,

13:07.662 --> 13:09.455
we knew that they were
selling whale meat.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.708
But there's also something
bigger going on.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.922
We heard that
the Obama administration

13:19.007 --> 13:21.550
was in closed-doors negotiations
with the Japanese

13:21.759 --> 13:23.135
to go do commercial whaling again.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.056
And I thought,
"Well, if we could prove

13:28.141 --> 13:29.808
"that endangered whales
are being served right here,

13:29.893 --> 13:31.602
"on the shores of America,

13:31.978 --> 13:33.395
"we would stop
that conversation."

13:33.688 --> 13:35.772
Stop the murder!
Stop the death!

13:35.857 --> 13:38.275
Hump restaurant is to blame!

13:39.319 --> 13:40.986
The animal-rights community
took it up,

13:41.070 --> 13:42.613
but the restaurant
didn't close down.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.076
There's this one guy
I'd never heard of before,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.204
his name is Ady Gil.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.166
He took some gear and put it out
in front of the Hump restaurant,

13:54.459 --> 13:55.459
as people are going in.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.294
So, what are you doing?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.462
I'm protesting.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.841
Yesterday, there were like
200 people here, protesting,

14:02.926 --> 14:04.510
and l thought, you know,

14:04.594 --> 14:06.637
somebody needs to keep
the pressure on.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.389
If you look at the Academy
Awards and the Golden Globes,

14:09.474 --> 14:12.017
those are his screens,
and that's all his projections.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.271
And, so, he parks this Ferrari
right next to the van,

14:16.564 --> 14:18.899
and the owner comes out
and tells Ady, he says,

14:19.275 --> 14:20.734
"How long
are you gonna be doing this?"

14:21.069 --> 14:23.403
And he thought that
I was just some hippie, you know,

14:23.488 --> 14:24.780
gonna be here for
a day or two.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.156
I said, "Listen, man.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.575
"I can be here for a month or two
or a year or whatever.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.787
"How long can you survive
while I am here?"

14:32.705 --> 14:34.581
Ten days later,
the restaurant closes down.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.502
To me,
it was a beautiful moment.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.254
Everybody had gone home,

14:40.588 --> 14:42.673
and this one guy with
this big, bright light,

14:43.007 --> 14:45.467
and keeps the light shining
on this subject.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.638
Shut it down!

14:55.562 --> 14:58.605
There are thousands of people
all over the world,

14:59.816 --> 15:03.944
willing and able and changing
their careers to save species.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.034
They go to some of
the darkest, grimmest,

15:11.119 --> 15:13.287
most unsafe places
on the planet.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.455
Let's save the shark!
Let's save the shark!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.916
Over 800 environmental activists
have been killed

15:18.167 --> 15:19.418
in just the last decade.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.379
So these guys are doing
the tough work,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.173
and we never hear about them.
They're not household names.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.636
Shawn Heinrichs,
I live in Boulder, Colorado.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.888
You can't get any more
landlocked than Colorado.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.309
And I found out that there's
this incredible ocean activist

15:36.728 --> 15:38.061
living right down the street

15:38.896 --> 15:41.398
who quit his job as a CFO
for a tech company

15:41.858 --> 15:43.567
so he could help save
endangered species.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.821
Shawn's doing some of the best,
most groundbreaking work

15:47.989 --> 15:50.407
that I've seen anywhere
in the world.

15:52.285 --> 15:56.413
Isla Mujeres was
the largest shark-fishing island

15:56.789 --> 15:58.457
on the east coast of Mexico.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.251
At least 20,
if not more, long-liners...

16:01.336 --> 16:03.462
...were targeting sharks
each and every single day.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.631
Shawn helped turn
this hunting ground...

16:06.382 --> 16:08.216
...into one of the top places
in the world

16:08.301 --> 16:09.718
where you can actually
go and watch sharks.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.889
Now you have this
community of ex-shark fishermen

16:14.307 --> 16:16.516
who are making much more money
taking tourists out

16:16.643 --> 16:18.185
to swim with whale sharks

16:18.269 --> 16:19.895
than killing sharks on long-lines.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.814
It's just simple economics.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.237
Shawn often works
with his buddy, Paul Hilton,

16:29.447 --> 16:30.781
an investigative photojournalist.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.242
They can't help but to get themselves
into dangerous situations.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.369
Traveler's paradise.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.995
Paul's a photojournalist,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.706
like me,
focused on endangered species.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.417
He's brilliant at what he does.

16:44.796 --> 16:49.007
Paul and Shawn try to bust rings
selling endangered species.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.010
We're gonna blow the lid
off this place, right?

16:52.095 --> 16:54.971
Shawn's pretty full-on.
I love his enthusiasm.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.391
He talks far too much
when we're on assignment.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.725
There's always that issue

16:58.810 --> 17:00.477
of me having to go to him
and say, "mate, wind it up."

17:00.561 --> 17:01.728
I think it's
the American in him.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.980
l'm rolling. l can distract.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.818
And a lot of the situations
we go into,

17:07.902 --> 17:09.319
it's always nice
to go in as teams,

17:09.404 --> 17:10.779
because you're going
into situations where

17:11.446 --> 17:13.281
you get caught up
in the moment with the camera,

17:13.449 --> 17:14.866
and you'll actually
photograph it, and

17:15.076 --> 17:16.535
there's no one
watching your back.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.078
Ask for the toilet.
Where's the toilet?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.621
Paul and Shawn
have this technique

17:19.705 --> 17:21.707
of... They have a camera
sitting around their neck,

17:21.790 --> 17:23.666
and most people think you
have to put it up to your eye

17:23.751 --> 17:25.377
to look through it and to shoot.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.002
And it's actually a video camera,

17:27.088 --> 17:28.755
and it's rolling the whole time.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.923
So many.

17:31.259 --> 17:35.345
And this is the Jaws,
movie Jaws?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.140
Don't push it too much, Shawn.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.766
Okay, cool. Very cool.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.935
I don't know about you. That's the
most fins I've ever, ever seen.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.186
How did you find out
about this?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.312
Facebook, basically.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.689
I mean, colleagues, mates...

17:46.399 --> 17:48.275
We just walked straight in, basically.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.359
Wow.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.570
How long were you there?

17:51.654 --> 17:52.779
Ten, 1 5 minutes.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.865
You did all this
in ten, 1 5 minutes?

17:54.949 --> 17:55.949
Oh, yeah, mate.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.452
Yeah.

17:58.703 --> 17:59.703
Are we almost there, Paul?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.163
Yeah, so, it's the next block.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.707
I didn't think that
the illegal-wildlife trade

18:03.791 --> 18:05.459
would be so overt.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.672
You can go down streets,

18:11.424 --> 18:14.176
and every other shop will be
full of endangered creatures.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.635
Look at this one right here.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.679
It's not just shark fins.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.056
It's just about
everything endangered

18:20.141 --> 18:21.850
in the world is for sale there.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.564
With the explosion
of demand in China

18:27.648 --> 18:28.648
for shark-fin soup,

18:29.358 --> 18:31.735
it was estimated
that 250,000 sharks

18:31.861 --> 18:34.821
are caught for the fin trade
every single day.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.283
Probably no other species

18:38.367 --> 18:40.327
illustrates what's going on in
the oceans right now

18:40.411 --> 18:41.578
better than sharks.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.539
Sharks predate dinosaurs.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.501
They survived four
mass-extinction events.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.964
And just this one generation
that I've been alive,

18:53.382 --> 18:55.967
we've cut down their ranks
about 90%.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.932
I was following
a group of shark finners

19:02.016 --> 19:03.934
in Indonesia, and they were
moving around camp to camp.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.354
And, then, one morning,

19:07.897 --> 19:09.981
I saw something reflecting
off in the coral reef

19:10.066 --> 19:11.191
in the shallow water.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.986
And what I discovered
was just horrific.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.784
There's this beautiful
tawny nurse shark,

19:20.868 --> 19:22.244
but it had all its fins cut off.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.997
And it was trying to swim,
but it couldn't swim.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.667
And it was heartbreaking,

19:28.751 --> 19:30.752
'cause it's like... This is
what the reality is.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.921
This is the thing that nobody gets.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.523
Now, are we gonna get... Any
luck with us getting in there?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.776
Okay.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.111
Shawn has an interpreter.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.948
I don't want to say her name,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.409
but she's been doing
undercover work in China

20:02.493 --> 20:04.119
for several decades.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.497
The first place she took us
was a place

20:07.582 --> 20:09.374
that they couldn't ever
get into before.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.628
Basically, the Walmart
of the endangered-species trade

20:13.713 --> 20:14.713
in Hong Kong.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.426
Over the years,

20:19.802 --> 20:21.803
I've actually worked really hard
to get into this facility.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.180
So has Paul
and so has his friends.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.434
And we've managed to maybe
step in the door for 30 seconds.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.560
Hey!

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
What's wrong?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.942
His staff would come out
and push us away,

20:36.235 --> 20:37.986
threaten to call the police.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.155
Hands, machete,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.240
kicked out the door,
"don't ever come back."

20:46.203 --> 20:47.370
Here's what we'll do.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.080
We have a car waiting
with all the stuff in it.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.042
I brought along a couple of
colleagues from the Hump bust.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.711
Heather Rally, who does
undercover work for us.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.504
And Charles Hambleton,

20:56.589 --> 20:59.215
who's sort of my director
of covert operations.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.259
In the alley here,
on the right-hand side?

21:01.344 --> 21:02.928
We invented a cover.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.388
We pretended like we were
on a culinary tour

21:05.556 --> 21:07.849
and we were looking for
exotic product.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.017
I think we stick to plan.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.269
We're going as culinary tourist
interests of Mr. Sawyer,

21:11.354 --> 21:13.730
and we're all here, learning
and taking pictures of culinary.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.482
You can get into
about as much trouble

21:15.566 --> 21:16.816
as you can possibly get into

21:16.901 --> 21:18.860
with a buttonhole camera
in China.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.028
If for some reason,

21:20.112 --> 21:21.655
we run into people
with badges and uniforms,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.782
strip off all the shit.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.825
Just rip it out from under your
shirt and throw it over a wall.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.994
Go right in.
Go in, go in, go in.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.329
Hi.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.644
We're starting a business
where we want to sell seafood.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.980
We have a seafood shop.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.190
Well, back where we do it,

21:57.274 --> 22:00.944
it's mainly tuna and marlin
and swordfish.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.029
They want to see something
more exciting.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.491
'Cause the Chinese traveler
and the Asian traveler

22:06.575 --> 22:08.743
has become big business now.
It's more than 50%.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.788
We should go.
We should probably go.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.914
No, no, no.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.465
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.637
I need to go to
the bathroom bad.

22:27.722 --> 22:28.888
There's the bathroom.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.724
Oh, thank you, thank you.

23:08.679 --> 23:09.763
Yeah.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.475
Are these expensive, also?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.983
$44,800 US Dollar per kilo.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.695
No way.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.248
We ended up going down the road

23:37.333 --> 23:39.084
to another warehouse
on the Hong Kong waterfront.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.960
Louie, look at this.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.756
It must have been
1 0,000-20,000 fins in one location.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.967
This was one of the biggest
facilities on the planet.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.219
Look at that.
It looks like a blue.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.180
The scale of it was
just out of control.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.932
l've never seen anything like
that before in my life.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.184
Jesus!

24:04.068 --> 24:08.321
I feel like this world
is absolutely insane.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.313
I remember once diving

24:42.398 --> 24:43.982
the northernmost islands
of the Galapagos,

24:44.608 --> 24:47.318
Darwin lsland and Wolf Island.
You know, islands that

24:47.403 --> 24:49.320
Darwin actually never had
been to before.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.742
It's the land before time.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.871
I mean, it's like land
before humans got there.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.213
And I remember
this giant whale shark came by,

25:07.298 --> 25:09.174
and then a pod of dolphins came by.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.467
You know, this is back
when you shot film.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.514
And the whole frame was just
filled with wildlife.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.936
And this dolphin came
swimming from behind

25:22.146 --> 25:24.772
the front of the whale shark,
and it grabbed this tuna,

25:24.899 --> 25:27.650
and it brought it and looked
right at me and shook it,

25:27.943 --> 25:30.820
and it swallowed it, tail first
down its throat.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.322
And I thought, "You know,

25:32.656 --> 25:36.367
"this is when you want 37 pictures
on a 36 roll of film."

25:39.455 --> 25:41.581
It's just magical, absolutely magical.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.548
As underwater photographers,

25:52.051 --> 25:53.343
photojournalists really,

25:54.386 --> 25:58.389
we're documenting a time and a place

25:59.808 --> 26:02.727
that in the future
may not be there.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.189
And the clock is moving.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.275
The first photographs I shot...

26:09.360 --> 26:12.403
...the assignment for
National Geographic, 1960,

26:12.655 --> 26:13.863
I took a total of.. .

26:14.323 --> 26:17.784
...seven or eight frames on
two and a quarter square film,

26:18.202 --> 26:21.162
on ektachrome film,
and butted them together.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.792
It was the first underwater, color
panoramicever done on the reefs.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.046
And this was when I came back
in 1 989.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.174
The beautiful Barrier Reef
forest went to hell.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.224
Now I'm looking around
and saying, "Well,

26:41.850 --> 26:42.892
"what happened here?

26:45.062 --> 26:48.523
"It's not so far off from what
happened 65 million years ago."

26:50.276 --> 26:52.235
Extinction is often being driven by...

26:52.319 --> 26:53.444
...direct human activity,

26:53.529 --> 26:56.990
things like habitat destruction
or overfishing.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.576
And then there's
global climate change,

27:00.703 --> 27:02.078
which is happening
in a different way.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.915
So we have these
sort of dual things,

27:06.000 --> 27:07.667
like the direct hand of man,

27:08.836 --> 27:11.045
and the indirect hand of man
in the change of climate.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.675
Climate is controlled
by the oceans.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.844
The oceans are the big guy.
They're in control.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.640
And the oceans now
are slowly changing.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.853
And that is the danger
we face today.

27:27.438 --> 27:31.024
A mass extinction is driven
by a change of the environment...

27:31.317 --> 27:34.402
...and we are changing
the environment precisely

27:34.528 --> 27:37.363
along the lines
that can trigger off

27:37.489 --> 27:38.781
one of these great catastrophes.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.120
There's been
five mass extinctions,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.122
and they've had
different causes,

27:46.540 --> 27:50.293
but there's been
one common factor in all.. .

27:52.629 --> 27:55.590
a massive increase
in carbon dioxide.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.552
And we've never had
a carbon-dioxide spike

27:59.636 --> 28:00.928
like what's happening now.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.684
We are burning through
the fossil fuels laid down

28:06.769 --> 28:08.728
over hundreds of millions
of years.

28:09.313 --> 28:12.565
Really reversing
geological history, basically.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.317
And we're doing it
really, really fast.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.283
In the Gulf oil spill,

28:22.618 --> 28:25.620
about 4.9 million barrels of oil
were spilled.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.207
That represents about a quarter...

28:29.291 --> 28:31.501
...of what we use every single day
in the U.S.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.129
You look at an event

28:35.297 --> 28:36.589
like the Gulf oil spill,
and you think,

28:36.715 --> 28:38.841
"This is the biggest
environmental catastrophe

28:38.967 --> 28:40.218
"in America ever."

28:40.719 --> 28:44.389
But that spill is nothing
compared to the damage

28:44.473 --> 28:46.599
caused by us doing
everyday things

28:46.683 --> 28:48.059
we don't even think about.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.063
And I'm more guilty than anyone.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.066
The worst thing you can do
to the environment

28:55.150 --> 28:56.192
is make a film about it.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.360
This looks really cool.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.820
We did a carbon assessment

28:58.904 --> 29:00.029
of the first two years
of production.

29:01.156 --> 29:07.537
And I was horrified at how much
energy it takes to do what I do.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.539
Sweet. We're gonna
turn this one on.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.833
We're at the point where
we're making our lives

29:12.167 --> 29:14.127
a lot better for us,

29:15.462 --> 29:17.296
but we're doing it
at the expense of

29:17.381 --> 29:18.381
of everything going forward.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.720
We have many, many ways
to fix this problem.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.724
The question is,
are we gonna do it fast enough?

29:32.062 --> 29:33.229
What we know at the moment

29:33.313 --> 29:35.273
is we're driving this
out of control...

29:35.399 --> 29:38.484
...and the ocean's chemistry
is changing really rapidly.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.735
Scarily fast.

29:41.572 --> 29:44.031
When we put carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere,

29:44.408 --> 29:45.658
it doesn't all stay there.

29:46.994 --> 29:50.121
Between a third and a half
gets absorbed by the oceans.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.958
The CO2 reacts with water

29:54.168 --> 29:55.877
to form something
called carbonic acid,

29:57.129 --> 29:59.213
and each year, the ocean
becomes more and more acidic.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.134
If you want to know
what that does,

30:03.719 --> 30:06.262
get a seashell and drop it in,

30:06.513 --> 30:08.264
...you know, a glass of vinegar.

30:12.978 --> 30:17.607
A whole variety of creatures
will simply

30:17.691 --> 30:21.486
dissolve into the acid ocean
that we have created.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.659
There's massive death
in the oceans.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.829
It's already started.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.582
Well, it's not only started,
it's well underway.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.752
Those are larvae?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.629
Yeah.
See the little...

30:39.713 --> 30:41.130
The brown smudge?

30:41.215 --> 30:42.381
Yeah, yeah.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.594
Each year, we harvest
seven to ten billion oyster larvae...

30:46.678 --> 30:50.056
...that we send out to growers
throughout the Pacific northwest.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.477
I still remember the day
all of the larvae essentially

30:54.561 --> 30:56.646
in our entire hatchery
were on the bottom of the tanks.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.316
So around six billion larvae all died
in a single day.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.572
That deep-ocean water

31:06.657 --> 31:09.158
off the coast of Washington
and Oregon

31:09.451 --> 31:11.619
comes into
the hatchery intakes,

31:12.704 --> 31:14.580
...and they can't grow
their shell.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.249
lt's dissolving faster
than they can grow it.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.504
It seemed outlandish to think
that the ocean

31:21.880 --> 31:24.549
could be acidified enough to
cause these kinds of problems.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.801
It just seemed like something
from the distant future

31:26.885 --> 31:29.136
and nothing we ever had
to pay attention to.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.975
The rate of change
that we're seeing in the ocean

31:34.101 --> 31:37.436
and the change that it's gonna
create in our food chain...

31:37.938 --> 31:41.023
it's gonna be dramatic, and it's
gonna be in our lifetimes.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.026
The things
that we're used to eating

31:44.194 --> 31:46.028
may not be available anymore,

31:46.113 --> 31:47.780
and we may need to transition
to, you know,

31:47.864 --> 31:49.740
eating jellyfish
or something like that.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.784
Start a new trend.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.917
It sounds a bit silly,

32:00.002 --> 32:03.296
"Change your diet
and save the planet"

32:03.922 --> 32:07.925
But if humans could
become vegetarians now,

32:08.010 --> 32:09.719
you would make
a massive difference.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.430
By far and away,

32:12.514 --> 32:16.309
the biggest factor in terms
of this mass extinction

32:16.602 --> 32:19.937
is destroying natural habitat
or converting natural habitat

32:20.022 --> 32:21.355
into land for food.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.735
The more dependent we are
on meat, milk, and eggs,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.988
the greater the CO2
and methane emissions.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.910
Cattle and Brahmanas of all kind

32:35.954 --> 32:41.417
produce methane as a byproduct
of breaking down grass

32:41.627 --> 32:43.878
and other things that they feed on.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.884
So, the contractions

32:49.968 --> 32:52.511
are pushing this gas
out from the stomach,

32:53.764 --> 32:55.640
going through here and the
one-way valve and into that?

32:55.724 --> 32:57.516
Yes. And after this,
we collect inside the bag.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.769
So, how long has that bag
been collecting gas?

32:59.853 --> 33:01.145
Only two hours.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.816
Methane is something
like 22 times more potent

33:06.943 --> 33:09.487
as a climate-changing gas
than is CO2,

33:09.571 --> 33:11.947
so it doesn't take very much
methane to make a difference.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.203
A cow can basically
fill up a 55-gallon garbage bag

33:17.287 --> 33:19.288
full of methane every day.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.627
One cow's not a problem, but now
we have 1 .5 billion of them.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.381
And it's an incredibly
inefficient way of producing food.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.179
Three-quarters of agricultural land
is used just to feed livestock.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.390
When you factor in everything,

33:38.100 --> 33:40.601
the clearing of the land
for grazing, feeding,

33:40.686 --> 33:43.979
and transporting, livestock
causes more greenhouse gases

33:44.398 --> 33:47.692
than all the direct emissions
from the entire transportation sector.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.862
I don't think it's
a competition between these problems.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.781
l don't think one could
be put above the other.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.366
lt's like saying,
"well, is global warming

33:55.450 --> 33:58.119
worse than ocean acidification?"

33:58.453 --> 34:02.164
Or, "Is fishing all the big fish in
the sea worse than polluting it?"

34:02.791 --> 34:04.875
I think it'd be foolish
to try and single out

34:04.960 --> 34:07.086
any one of them to say
this is how we're gonna

34:07.170 --> 34:08.545
fix the planet's problems.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.505
We need to fight them
on all fronts.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.228
Look at all the rodents.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.149
They're like house cats.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.821
Look at this one.
lt's still alive.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.616
A lot of doors closing.

34:37.701 --> 34:38.743
Lights going off.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.536
That's scary, man.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.371
Yeah, we're definitely
not welcome here.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.500
In 2003, the government clamped
down on the wildlife markets

34:46.585 --> 34:49.879
across southern China, so things
started to go underground,

34:49.963 --> 34:52.047
so operating
in early hours of the morning.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.132
And it's horrific.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.260
They're shutting down.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.387
-What?
-They're shutting down.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.597
That's crazy.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.140
They're hiding them now.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.435
Oh, my gosh!

35:06.438 --> 35:10.024
This is a market that had to
switch places twice that year.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.567
Oh. What are they doing?

35:11.985 --> 35:13.569
I mean, they know they're
not supposed to be doing

35:13.653 --> 35:14.779
what they're doing.

35:16.782 --> 35:17.990
That's hardcore.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.165
The more endangered it is,
the more illegal it is,

35:26.249 --> 35:27.833
the more we have to go
to the back rooms.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.046
Go straight up.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.882
So, Louie,

35:34.966 --> 35:36.884
l want to show you
something right here.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.263
You're looking at
a dozen manta rays

35:41.348 --> 35:43.349
sitting right in
these bags right here.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.310
When you consider that each
of these animals

35:46.520 --> 35:48.979
has one pup every couple years,

35:49.231 --> 35:52.817
you're looking at literally
an entire generation wiped out,

35:52.901 --> 35:53.943
just in these bags.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.406
A few years ago, I started
noticing species of

35:59.491 --> 36:02.868
manta and mobula ray
lined up in the streets

36:02.994 --> 36:05.079
in areas that used to be
predominantly shark ports.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.499
And it was really confusing
to me, because I understood

36:08.583 --> 36:10.292
that you can't use their wings
for shark-fin soup,

36:10.460 --> 36:12.920
and the meat from these rays
is very pungent.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.714
It's not worth the time
of bringing in

36:15.799 --> 36:17.424
these huge, heavy animals.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.095
I couldn't believe
when I walked in.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.973
There's just giant, oceanic
mantas all lined up in a row.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.644
And just wanted to know
what was going on,

36:28.728 --> 36:30.938
and then l started watching them
cutting out the gills.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.607
The gills are missing.
Where did they put them?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.067
Where did they take the gills?

36:35.777 --> 36:37.278
And it came down to this.

36:37.571 --> 36:41.782
It was an old cultural remedy
in a very small, coastal town

36:41.867 --> 36:43.784
in southern China,
and that was over 50 years ago.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.954
And that had
largely disappeared,

36:47.122 --> 36:49.540
but I think it was just
following the Sars outbreak,

36:49.958 --> 36:51.250
somebody got it
in their mind that

36:51.334 --> 36:52.543
"Hey, we're running out
of sharks.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.170
"What other products
can we move into the pipeline?"

37:10.061 --> 37:11.896
The gills of manta rays ended up

37:11.980 --> 37:14.315
in all the traditional
Chinese medicine stores

37:14.399 --> 37:15.858
and the dried-seafood stores.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.889
I remember my first encounter
with a manta in the water.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.140
It's something
I'll never forget.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.770
I'm sitting in the water,
and then just out of the blue,

37:52.854 --> 37:56.106
this manta ray does
this huge flyby, right past,

37:57.567 --> 37:59.318
and then goes back
into the blue.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.238
And then I'm just left
breathless, waiting.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.831
Just recently, we were in Bali.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.377
At the end of the last dive,
everyone's out of the water.

38:18.088 --> 38:19.254
And I look down,

38:19.339 --> 38:20.881
and this one manta comes
right underneath me

38:21.883 --> 38:23.300
and then just stops,
and it hovers,

38:23.385 --> 38:25.511
and it's about 1 5 feet down,
and it just-- It's not moving.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.096
And I'm like, "That's interesting."

38:30.475 --> 38:34.395
I look, and there's fishing line
tailing off the top of its body.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.983
And the first thing I did
is I swam down.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.484
I snipped the line off
the top of its head,

38:40.568 --> 38:41.986
right just above the hook.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.869
And swam up.

38:54.708 --> 38:55.958
She didn't swim away.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.793
She was just hovering
right underneath me.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.844
So I swim back down to her
one more time,

39:06.928 --> 39:08.846
and I put my hand gently
right on the front of her head,

39:09.264 --> 39:11.265
and I put my hand on the hook,

39:11.725 --> 39:16.270
and I slowly worked that hook
right out of its top jaw.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.901
And I thought, "That's it.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.820
"You know, she's gonna
swim off now. She's been saved."

39:25.822 --> 39:27.740
I look down, and she's
circling right under my feet.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.202
So I swim back down to her
one more time,

39:32.287 --> 39:34.872
and I put my hand right next
to where the injury was,

39:34.956 --> 39:36.498
as if sort of rubbing it
and saying, "Hey, listen.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.875
"You're gonna be okay."

39:41.796 --> 39:44.089
And I put my head
right next to her eye,

39:44.174 --> 39:46.091
and I just remember her eye
moving back and forth

39:46.176 --> 39:48.385
between my mask,
looking at both my eyes...

39:51.306 --> 39:53.932
and realized that she knew
I was trying to help her.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.153
Often, people say, "How can
one person make a difference?"

40:07.947 --> 40:11.283
What if you could see
how shark-fin soup is made?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.412
If you could see how each year,

40:15.497 --> 40:18.916
up to 70 million sharks
are killed to end up in soup,

40:19.542 --> 40:20.542
could you still eat it?

40:21.544 --> 40:23.212
I shared the footage of
a live, finned shark

40:23.296 --> 40:25.380
in Indonesia with WildAid,

40:25.465 --> 40:27.257
an organizer that has been
working on shark conservation

40:27.342 --> 40:28.383
in China.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.220
The film went to
over a billion people in Asia.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.139
80% who were surveyed who saw it

40:34.224 --> 40:36.266
said they were either gonna
quit eating shark-fin soup

40:36.351 --> 40:38.477
or drastically reduce
their consumption of it.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.731
Remember, when the buying stops,
the killing can, too.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.738
As a still photographer,

40:50.115 --> 40:52.032
I can see the power of an image.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.284
It was transformative.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.792
But I think it's in our DNA to
take care of future generations,

41:03.628 --> 41:07.673
and if you can find that way in,

41:09.092 --> 41:12.845
you can reach people
really quickly and change them.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.141
The human eye
is so limited.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.434
We see only a tiny,
little sliver

41:19.519 --> 41:21.353
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.355
It's like if you owned
a grand piano in your house,

41:23.439 --> 41:25.732
but you could only hear
one note on it.

41:27.861 --> 41:31.321
Normally, carbon dioxide gas
is invisible to the human eye,

41:31.698 --> 41:34.408
but certain wavelengths
of infrared will be absorbed

41:34.492 --> 41:36.994
by gases like CO2 or methane.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.620
So that's what's
going on here.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.165
This camera has a very
particular color filter on it,

41:41.749 --> 41:44.418
enabling us to visualize
the CO2 gas

41:44.502 --> 41:46.211
that's coming out of
our noses and mouths.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.340
We had two cameras.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.260
One camera that sees
what your eye sees,

41:54.262 --> 41:56.388
and the other,
what the fossil-fuel companies

41:56.472 --> 41:58.390
don't want the rest
of the world to see.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.185
The carbon dioxide world.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.145
Let's do
this one coming at us.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.357
Three, two, one.

42:14.324 --> 42:16.533
I mean, it's disgusting,
but it's beautiful.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.453
So, let's
just go up left here.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.954
-On the left here?
-Real slow here.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.623
Where these guys are gonna be,
a slow creep.

42:22.707 --> 42:23.749
Slowly, slowly,
slow down.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.459
Slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly, slowly, slowly.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.585
Wow.

42:38.514 --> 42:41.433
Just about everything
that we do emits carbon dioxide,

42:42.227 --> 42:45.145
from the way we heat
and air-condition our houses,

42:45.730 --> 42:48.649
the way we do
our transportation systems,

42:48.733 --> 42:50.484
whether it's planes,
trains, or automobiles.

42:54.447 --> 42:57.658
Just about everything pumps out
vast amounts of carbon dioxide.

42:59.661 --> 43:01.286
But you can't see it.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.749
To be able to see
this hidden world was like

43:05.833 --> 43:07.709
you were let in on
this magic trick,

43:09.587 --> 43:11.713
but the magic trick that was
actually killing the planet.

43:13.758 --> 43:17.010
This looks like a big parade
of crap, doesn't it?

43:17.095 --> 43:18.178
Just filth.

43:23.977 --> 43:25.018
Yep.

43:27.188 --> 43:28.647
So, what are you
working on, buddy?

43:28.731 --> 43:29.982
Come on in.
l will show you.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.441
Is this your
flux capacitor?

43:31.526 --> 43:32.567
It's close.

43:32.652 --> 43:33.652
Oh, right here,
actually.

43:33.736 --> 43:34.903
I can spin this.
You see this?

43:34.988 --> 43:35.988
It shoots carbon dioxide.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.115
I mean, what, the government
hiring you? Whose doing it?

43:38.199 --> 43:39.533
You just doing
your own thing or what?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.493
-lt's like a science project.
-Yeah. Just a science project.

43:41.577 --> 43:42.577
Science project?

43:49.544 --> 43:50.627
In many ways,

43:50.712 --> 43:54.631
our generation is the one with
the last hand on the throttle

43:54.716 --> 43:56.466
that just pushes
that throttle down.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.554
We're putting
so much carbon dioxide

44:01.389 --> 44:03.765
and so much methane
into the atmosphere,

44:04.600 --> 44:06.518
it's quite possible,
if you think about it...

44:06.936 --> 44:09.187
...that the baby boom
generation itself,

44:09.856 --> 44:12.190
is the single most
impactful generation

44:12.317 --> 44:14.234
of mammals this planet
has ever seen.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.491
In the anthropocene,
we're changing every parameter.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.869
We're changing the geology
of the planet.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.246
We're changing the chemistry
of the ocean.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.874
The anthropocene means that

44:29.709 --> 44:32.210
what happens to this planet
is now in our own hands.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.636
When you take any drop
off the ocean anywhere

44:42.805 --> 44:44.431
and you look under a microscope,

44:45.224 --> 44:48.685
there's so much beauty there
on this tiny scale,

44:48.770 --> 44:51.146
this miniature architecture

44:51.481 --> 44:53.357
that I never tire of looking at.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.234
Our first speaker is Boris Worm,

44:56.569 --> 44:58.612
and he's published
a number of important

44:58.696 --> 45:00.947
and controversial papers
in recent years

45:01.032 --> 45:02.741
on the decline of phytoplankton.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.119
When I give a talk on
plankton, I say, first of all,

45:06.204 --> 45:08.246
let's take a breath,
and let's take a second breath,

45:08.373 --> 45:09.664
and then contemplate the fact

45:09.749 --> 45:11.583
that that second breath
came from the ocean,

45:11.834 --> 45:14.544
because it was produced
ultimately by phytoplankton,

45:14.629 --> 45:16.880
which produce half of the oxygen
we breathe.

45:18.633 --> 45:22.427
We're aware that we are changing
the ocean at a global scale.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.096
There's multiple human impacts,

45:24.180 --> 45:27.140
ranging from fishing to climate
change and acidification,

45:27.892 --> 45:31.311
implying that no part of the
ocean is free from human impact.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.648
Using satellite
imagery and other data...

45:36.150 --> 45:38.026
...Dr. Worm determined
that we have may have lost

45:38.111 --> 45:41.196
40% of plankton production
in just the last 50 years.

45:42.198 --> 45:45.826
It's happening primarily as
a consequence of climate change,

45:46.536 --> 45:48.912
and there is
a lot of controversy,

45:48.996 --> 45:50.122
because it's a big question.

45:50.331 --> 45:53.208
And if this plankton decline
pans out to be as dramatic

45:53.292 --> 45:56.420
as we think it is,
then that would be a big deal.

45:59.382 --> 46:02.092
Your life depends on
the oceans breathing.

46:03.928 --> 46:07.139
And, in fact, animals could
only exist on land

46:07.807 --> 46:11.852
after plankton in the oceans
had produced enough oxygen

46:11.936 --> 46:13.437
for them to live by.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.071
We have this illusion
that it's the big things

46:23.156 --> 46:24.573
in the environment that count.

46:25.867 --> 46:27.701
But if you lose
the small things...

46:29.954 --> 46:31.204
Everything else fails.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.401
It's like there's
this incredible web

47:01.486 --> 47:02.819
where we're all connected,

47:05.072 --> 47:06.740
and if you take out
one little thing,

47:06.824 --> 47:07.991
let's say like plankton,

47:09.535 --> 47:12.245
everything, the whole web collapses.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.292
It's like having a symphony.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.755
And one by one,
you just pluck

47:21.839 --> 47:24.049
each of the instruments

47:25.968 --> 47:27.260
out of the orchestra.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.309
Till your last voice is there.

47:39.482 --> 47:42.442
And then, it's gone.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.908
It's out of order when globally,

47:50.368 --> 47:52.994
most of the world's fighting
to protect these species,

47:53.371 --> 47:56.623
and he's taking 600,
possibly even more, every year.

47:57.416 --> 47:58.917
That's the processing plant.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.419
Paul found this guy,
Mr. Lee,

48:01.837 --> 48:04.673
one of the biggest smugglers of
endangered sharks in the world.

48:05.007 --> 48:07.634
They had three protected species
of sharks- basking sharks,

48:07.718 --> 48:10.053
great whites, and whale sharks.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.305
Well, like I said, if I had
a possible business opportunity

48:12.390 --> 48:15.475
to buy omega-3 oils
from him.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.893
What do I need to know
about fish oil?

48:17.103 --> 48:19.646
Say, "Look,
we need 1 00% confirmation

48:19.730 --> 48:22.691
"that it's a good product," and,
then, yeah, ask for samples.

48:22.775 --> 48:25.318
I'm just gonna play it, like,
a little bit angry, defensive,

48:25.403 --> 48:27.195
and you're gonna try
to pacify me.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.656
Where am I operating
out of in the U .S.?

48:29.865 --> 48:31.116
l'm gonna say Brooklyn.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.325
Wherever. That's your call, mate.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.204
Shark oil is being used
for omega-3,

48:37.623 --> 48:40.083
but these sharks he's trading
are endangered

48:40.167 --> 48:42.085
and protected in China
and internationally.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.755
The only law
that we really had

48:45.840 --> 48:47.799
to protect endangered species
is CITES.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.427
CITES is the convention

48:50.511 --> 48:52.095
for international trade
of endangered species.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.890
And there's only
a few hundred animals

48:55.975 --> 48:57.017
that are actually on that list.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.270
And part of the reason
is because

49:01.063 --> 49:02.981
the people that control CITES

49:03.566 --> 49:06.067
are actually in
the trade of selling them.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.486
Ahead of this CITES conference,

49:08.571 --> 49:10.447
a new decision-making mechanism

49:10.865 --> 49:12.407
to set up a centralized system...

49:12.700 --> 49:15.035
for the resumption
of the international trade

49:15.119 --> 49:16.453
in elephant ivory.

49:39.602 --> 49:40.810
The economy's been down.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.687
lt's taking a while to
get people interested.

49:43.105 --> 49:45.690
Obviously, Mr. Sawyer's
very interested.

49:53.658 --> 49:56.826
Can we take
a very small sample back of...

49:57.620 --> 50:00.455
Just to let you know, last time,
he did give me some, and...

50:00.539 --> 50:01.539
I need to test it though.

50:01.666 --> 50:02.999
We need to have
my people test it.

50:04.335 --> 50:05.919
I don't know who your lab is.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.463
I'm sorry, l'm sorry.
This will be my lab.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.592
Can l just borrow Louie
for one second?

50:13.344 --> 50:15.553
You have to talk.
Just one second, Louie.

50:15.638 --> 50:18.390
Just they want... They
want to know about...

50:41.080 --> 50:43.415
I just want to make sure
that five years from now,

50:43.499 --> 50:44.999
we don't have problems
with people saying,

50:45.084 --> 50:47.210
"Oh, we fished out
all the whale sharks."

51:11.944 --> 51:13.236
-Yeah.
-Okay.

51:16.240 --> 51:20.076
1 00%. 1 00% whale shark.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.244
Yeah.

51:21.746 --> 51:23.747
We walked up
the steps and looked into

51:23.831 --> 51:25.206
the processing ground.

51:27.460 --> 51:31.087
And there was whale sharks
chopped in bits all over the floor,

51:31.505 --> 51:33.631
so we just walked in
and started photographing.

51:37.470 --> 51:41.765
Then, we sent out a press
release to the world's media.

51:45.728 --> 51:47.771
It went viral. We
had National Geographic,

51:47.855 --> 51:49.856
Time magazine, the BBC.

51:50.316 --> 51:51.524
It just went everywhere.

51:53.903 --> 51:56.404
The Chinese government
are doing a lot, at the moment,

51:56.489 --> 51:57.989
for endangered species.

51:58.324 --> 51:59.449
They're burning ivory.

51:59.825 --> 52:02.744
They've banned shark-fin soup
at government banquets.

52:04.497 --> 52:06.289
And things are really moving
in the right direction.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.252
Bye-bye.

52:11.337 --> 52:12.629
-Bye. Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.131
So I just hope
they can be proactive with Mr. Lee.

52:17.259 --> 52:18.843
We are down about it,

52:18.928 --> 52:21.471
but maybe there is light
at the end of the tunnel.

52:21.722 --> 52:22.722
Yeah.

52:35.736 --> 52:38.488
It's really easy
for us to look east and say,

52:38.572 --> 52:39.656
"You know,
look what China's doing.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.325
"They're destroying the planet.
They're polluting everything.

52:42.409 --> 52:43.910
"They're wiping out species."

52:45.246 --> 52:47.997
But the west is already doing
an incredible job

52:48.582 --> 52:52.043
of massively depleting
and damaging the environment

52:52.127 --> 52:54.504
and taking out
a lot of threatened species.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.425
What's happening in China now
is they're going through

52:59.510 --> 53:01.928
the same growing pains
that we did.

53:03.138 --> 53:04.597
But when we went through
our growing pains,

53:04.682 --> 53:06.349
there was only a billion people
on the planet.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.477
With China going through
its growing pains,

53:09.895 --> 53:12.480
there's over 1 .3 billion people
in China alone.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.194
We've already pushed
so many vulnerable species

53:18.279 --> 53:19.529
and the environment
to the brink.

53:21.740 --> 53:26.202
We can't afford to keep
making the same mistakes,

53:28.289 --> 53:29.706
because there will be nothing left.

53:36.755 --> 53:39.674
Some of the world's rarest amphibians
are inside that trailer.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.013
I've heard up to half
of all frog species

53:45.097 --> 53:47.390
could be gone
in the next 20 years.

53:47.474 --> 53:48.516
Yeah.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.853
There are 7,000 species
of amphibian,

53:52.980 --> 53:54.522
and they're all endangered.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.651
PhotoArk's my 20-year attempt
to photograph

53:58.736 --> 54:00.361
every captive species
on Earth.

54:01.906 --> 54:05.158
One guy's desperate attempt
to get people to care. That's it.

54:07.578 --> 54:08.620
There he is.

54:08.704 --> 54:11.331
The very last
rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog.

54:11.415 --> 54:12.498
Very last one.

54:13.042 --> 54:15.710
Chytrid fungus wiped them all out
in Panama, so he's the last one.

54:15.794 --> 54:16.878
That's it.

54:16.962 --> 54:18.004
When he's gone,
they'll be extinct.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.841
Can we lift his chin up a little
bit for me, please?

54:21.926 --> 54:22.967
Perfect.

54:23.719 --> 54:25.178
This is his big moment.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.850
A lot of times,
these pictures I do

54:30.935 --> 54:33.561
are the only national coverage
these animals will ever get

54:33.646 --> 54:34.646
before they go extinct.

54:34.730 --> 54:36.230
This is it.
This is their one chance.

54:37.691 --> 54:40.318
I really hope the PhotoArk
isn't just some sort of

54:40.402 --> 54:43.947
an archive of the things
we lost, but instead,

54:44.031 --> 54:45.823
it's a chance to get
people interested,

54:46.116 --> 54:49.202
look these animals in the eye,
and fall in love with them.

54:52.414 --> 54:55.833
There's only 330,
340 species of turtles,

54:55.918 --> 54:58.127
and half of them are under threat.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.552
If the temperature rises on
the planet just a few degrees,

55:07.346 --> 55:09.722
they're very susceptible
to extinction.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.727
So, this is really
the last line of defense,

55:14.979 --> 55:18.064
keeping animals
that are extinct in the wild

55:18.148 --> 55:19.816
in a captive situation.

55:21.610 --> 55:24.487
l think you could compare
something like this,

55:24.571 --> 55:27.949
or nature in general,
to the finest works of art...

55:28.033 --> 55:30.076
...on the planet,
and in my opinion more than,

55:30.160 --> 55:32.996
you know, the best Picasso,
Matisse, Warhol.

55:39.003 --> 55:40.420
Life wants to flourish.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.922
DNA wants to go forward.

55:43.507 --> 55:44.966
We need to be part of that.

55:47.594 --> 55:50.096
Why would we
want to do anything to disrupt

55:50.180 --> 55:53.182
something that took
billions of years to evolve?

56:04.445 --> 56:06.612
See how the trees
are all falling into the lake?

56:06.697 --> 56:08.906
And they're doing that
because the permafrost

56:08.991 --> 56:11.075
in the ground is melting.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.162
In the Arctic,

56:14.246 --> 56:15.955
in these cold regions
around the planet,

56:16.040 --> 56:18.332
underneath the lakes,
underneath the oceans,

56:18.667 --> 56:22.462
there's vast, vast quantities
of frozen methane

56:23.213 --> 56:24.964
that's been in there
for millions of years.

56:27.176 --> 56:30.428
This lake has a lot of
methane bubbling out of it.

56:30.512 --> 56:33.056
ln fact, we can light
those methane bubbles on fire.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.392
School kids know
about the extinction event

56:36.477 --> 56:37.685
that killed
all the big dinosaurs,

56:38.228 --> 56:41.230
but paleontologists, you know,
the connoisseurs of this,

56:41.315 --> 56:43.483
they look back at
the Permian extinction.

56:44.818 --> 56:47.236
That's the biggest extinction
in the history of the planet.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.988
Almost all life
on the planet disappeared.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.326
It's called "The Great Dying."

56:57.039 --> 56:59.123
You know,
the K-T is pretty obvious.

56:59.208 --> 57:01.626
That was caused by a meteor,
but what the hell killed

57:01.710 --> 57:04.504
all the animals on land and sea
back at the Permian?

57:09.927 --> 57:11.427
And now they're coming around
to thinking,

57:11.804 --> 57:12.970
"It was probably methane."

57:15.808 --> 57:17.892
So, the Arctic's
getting gradually warmer,

57:18.268 --> 57:19.811
and the methane
that's been locked away

57:20.562 --> 57:23.689
for millions of years,
is starting to come out.

57:27.236 --> 57:28.694
When all this gets going,

57:28.779 --> 57:31.739
we will have, what we call,
a runaway effect.

57:33.867 --> 57:37.036
That's runaway climate change,
and that's unstoppable.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.291
Are you all right?

57:42.376 --> 57:44.544
The only way to tackle
the methane problem,

57:45.379 --> 57:47.964
is to reduce CO2 emissions,

57:48.048 --> 57:50.133
because that's what's
warming the Arctic,

57:50.217 --> 57:52.051
letting this methane bubble up.

57:55.556 --> 57:58.057
You know, the great irony is,
like, the oil companies,

57:58.142 --> 58:00.309
they see the melting of the ice
as an opportunity

58:00.394 --> 58:01.769
to go up there
and drill more holes for oil.

58:02.062 --> 58:04.021
And what we don't realize,
it's underneath that,

58:04.106 --> 58:05.940
that's what people
have to worry about.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.943
We do know from
the fossil record

58:09.027 --> 58:12.572
that even pre-human climate
changes could happen fast.

58:13.073 --> 58:14.615
l'm not talking
millions of years.

58:14.700 --> 58:17.451
I'm talking three years
or four years.

58:17.703 --> 58:18.911
Way less than a mortgage,

58:19.413 --> 58:21.247
Less time than it takes for
your kid to go through college.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.250
And what if
the world's temperature

58:24.334 --> 58:26.085
goes up six degrees
in three years?

58:28.088 --> 58:31.090
It will lead to
massive death in the oceans.

58:32.259 --> 58:34.552
When the oceans start dying
like that,

58:35.220 --> 58:37.680
the planet can't function
as it used to function.

58:39.141 --> 58:42.268
And when that happens,
life everywhere fails.

58:45.272 --> 58:46.522
That is a mass extinction.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.694
There's this
remote island in Indonesia.

59:35.364 --> 59:36.364
It's right at the tip,

59:36.448 --> 59:38.783
where the sea comes sort of
crashing into this channel,

59:40.244 --> 59:43.412
and through this quarter
are whales and dolphins

59:43.497 --> 59:44.497
and all kinds of animals.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.420
And at the tip of this island
is this village called Lamakera.

59:54.216 --> 59:58.928
There's no place on Earth that
we know of where more manta rays

59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.013
are being killed than
in that single village.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.230
We realized if we were gonna
deal with the manta issue,

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.190
we had to go to ground zero.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.528
These are manta rays.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:18.739
They make, like,
sets of 20 or 40,

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:20.950
and they're about $20 a set,

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.785
and you get a couple of sets
off a manta, maximum.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.997
And then you get about
$500 to $600 from the gills.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.458
Those are gills.
You can see the end of it.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:34.046
All the cartilage
will be sent to China

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:39.802
to be crushed down into pills
for glucosamine sulfate

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.137
for the sore joints
and stuff.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.059
We sat down to meet with the
Kepala Desa, who's the chief.

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.431
Initially, they weren't
very welcoming.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.515
They didn't want us to stay.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:31.187
But ultimately, we managed
to talk our way onto

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.438
one of the fishing vessels.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.406
Ask them how they caught it.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.375
See it?

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.046
A couple of hours into
the fishing trip,

01:01:57.130 --> 01:02:01.592
they saw this black figure
on the surface just cruising.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:18.943
Paul, left.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.488
Blood starts to color the water.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.913
Over the course of an hour,

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.331
this thing struggles
for its life.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.585
It's big.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.450
And I'm looking at this,
and I'm going,

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.076
"God, I can't do this."

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.998
He just sticks in the brain
of this animal,

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.833
and it just freaks out.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:23.883
And I actually watched its soul
just disappear in front of me,

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.302
and then it went limp.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:37.688
Paul, hurry.

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:40.858
No, no. Don't panic,
don't panic.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:47.740
As we're going towards
the village,

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.909
an armada of boats
start streaming past us.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.083
And they're all triangulating
on this group of manta rays

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.210
that have come into
their waters.

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:14.808
And the first thing they do
is start hacking into the gills.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:24.527
With the advent of traders
providing diesel-powered engines

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.904
and a supply chain
all the way out to China,

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:32.868
they transitioned very quickly
to a full-on commercial outfit.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.999
And it's only a few years
before the manta rays

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.334
will be wiped out.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.675
They realize
the numbers are dropping.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:54.306
Even if we weren't here, they
realize something has to change.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:00.896
What are their children
going to be doing?

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:04.900
They're gonna have nothing left.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.619
It's just losing
a bit of magic, you know?

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:20.124
The world, without that species,
to me, it's empty, you know?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.396
In 200 years,

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.692
people will look back
on this particular period

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:49.737
and say to themselves,

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:54.116
"How did those people
at that time just allow...

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.619
"...all these amazing creatures
to vanish?"

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.462
But it would be very little use
in me or anybody else

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:10.507
exerting all this energy
to save the wild places,

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.552
if people are not being educated

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:16.305
into being better stewards
than we've been.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.193
If we all lose hope,
there is no hope.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.779
Without hope,
people fall into apathy.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:37.826
There's still a lot left
that's worth fighting for.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:44.958
About two decades ago,

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.004
the Baiji dolphin
was extremely vulnerable.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.756
There was hundreds of them left.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.802
l mean, I thought, "Well,
there's enough out there.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.720
"Somebody's gonna do something
to save this animal."

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:59.348
This animal, it wasn't just
the last of its species,

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.850
it was the last of
an entire family of cetaceans.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.728
So l thought,
"Humans, somebody, somewhere,

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:06.188
"has got to go out
and save these animals.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.564
"They have to,
because they're dying off."

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.693
They're all gone now.
They went extinct.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:14.029
ln my lifetime
they went extinct. So...

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:23.163
We always think that
there's gonna be somebody else

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.791
around to save these animals.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.973
This field is
one of the last places on Earth

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.058
where you can see
a Florida grasshopper sparrow.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.104
And there's fewer males
singing every year.

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:51.525
We're roughly around
20 sparrows a year.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.193
From 1 50 to 20,

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.197
so it's getting harder every
year to find the bird.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:07:59.241
Did you hear something?

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:00.784
That's a grasshopper sparrow.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.540
Phase-out is a term you hear
sometimes by zoo-keepers.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.419
When a species is
no longer viable in captivity,

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.880
they think about phasing it out.

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:17.050
Just kind of slip off
into extinction.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.801
There he is.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.095
There, you got him, you got him.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.683
Right there.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.435
You'll never
phase out an elephant

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.604
or a panda or a rhino.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.734
But, you know,
if it's a small, brown bird,

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:37.279
how are you ever gonna get
people excited about that?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:45.996
My pictures of the sparrow ended
up on the cover ofAudubon.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.417
And when the U.S. Fish
& Wildlife Service saw that,

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.337
they went from allocating
$30,000 a year

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.255
towards the grasshopper sparrow...

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:56.673
Looking good.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:02.720
...to about $1 .3 million
this year to try to study it

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.932
and turn things around
for this bird.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:11.604
There he goes.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.363
To me, photography
isn't just about showing

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:21.740
somebody how beautiful
something is.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.828
It's a weapon.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.961
Remember what Ady Gil was able
to do with that little projector

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:37.256
in front of the Hump?
What he was able to achieve.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:43.178
I thought, "Well,
how can we scale this up?"

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.520
When we dream,
we don't dream inside of a box.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.522
We dream inside of worlds.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.608
Early photographs were circular.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.902
Even early TVs were circular.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.613
But to make more
out of the medium,

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.491
there was a decision made
to crop it into a box.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:09.079
And the box has a lot to do with
the way we think.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.585
My way has always been
blowing up the medium

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.336
into a million pieces...

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.089
...and letting it become
something else.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:31.935
Travis has done projections on
iconic buildings all over the world.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.897
My fantasy would be
to take the work

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.107
of my photographer friends
at National Geographic

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:40.569
and amplify their message
by orders of magnitude.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.115
If we would have just
had, like, a whale going by...

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.992
...and then it jumps off
into some other building.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.160
It'd be beautiful.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.705
I still love the idea
of sharks on Wall Street.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:53.832
What do you think?

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:56.043
Yeah. No problem.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.755
80% of the greenhouse gases
that are caused by cities

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:01.548
are caused
by commercial buildings.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.177
Tony Malkin, the guy that owns
the Empire State Building,

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.179
probably the most iconic
building in the world,

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.555
and he's greened it.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.808
Everyone had written off
the Empire State Building

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.435
as outmoded and obsolete.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.647
We retrofitted
6,500 windows,

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:18.857
replaced all the lights
with LEDs,

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:21.318
redid the heating
and cooling systems.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:25.906
From that, we actually
saved $4.4 million a year.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.825
The best way to
move the needle,

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:30.869
when people are talking
about the environment,

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.746
is the bottom line.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.209
l like to project
into the woods.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:39.711
Try to see
the whole building?

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.004
Yeah, we'd see
the whole building.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:42.464
And we could also, like,

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.967
the mobile idea,
where we can mount projectors

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.302
onto trucks
and just drive with them.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:48.679
That would be cool.

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.056
Travis had
drawn up an illustration

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.307
of a mobile
projection vehicle.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.017
Just looking at the plans,

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:56.144
it opened up a whole new world
of possibility.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.068
It can't just be
the environmental activists

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.946
that care about
getting off of fossil fuels.

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:09.241
Everybody has to become
a part of it.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.285
I heard that
there's this race car driver

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.538
that was an environmentalist
in a sport

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.999
that traditionally doesn't care
about the environment.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.876
So, like,
a living contradiction.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:22.796
When I go to
the sports-marketing companies

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.256
and l say,
"Can you help me find sponsors?"

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.509
And then l give them the list
of people I won't work with--

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:30.762
No fossil fuels, no oil,
no coal, no meat,

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.849
no people who tested on animals,
no fur, no leather.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.726
They just look at me like...

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:38.520
"I don't know how you
want us to help you."

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.982
Leilani MUnter
has just passed five cars

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:45.318
in the last lap and a half,
and she is real impressive...

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.529
Sometimes,
I have an environmentalist say,

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.531
"Well, if you were really
an environmentalist, you know,

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:50.615
"you'd be racing a bike."

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.784
And the problem with that
is then I wouldn't have

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.370
75 million people paying
attention to my sport.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:12:59.499
Thank you.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.716
You look at a guy
like Elon Musk.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:11.011
He builds reusable rocket ships
to supply the space station.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.181
He's the biggest installer
of solar in America,

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:18.393
and he built the best-rated car
ever made, and it's electric.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.980
Leilani knew Elon Musk.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:26.651
l think we are currently doing
something very, very dumb,

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:30.739
which is to run this experiment
on how much CO2

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.449
the oceans and atmosphere
can hold.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.160
In order to have a future
that does not result

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.287
in an environmental catastrophe,

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.039
followed by economic collapse,

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:42.375
which is what would occur
if we didn't get off oil.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.336
That's why we have to have
electric cars.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:47.089
I think we want to put in
an order for a car today.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.465
Excellent. Well, take one.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.559
All right. Go ahead.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.228
Yeah.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.438
It's pretty quick.

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:05.816
Is this gonna go that fast
with 1 05 pounds on it?

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.067
Yeah.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.280
Oh, yeah.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:14.699
You know, I mean,
the focal length on it is crazy,

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.119
but you'll be able to
shoot really far with it.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.954
You can zoom hundreds
of feet from something

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:21.623
or like 1 ,000 feet
and scale it.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.083
Thousands of feet
with this?

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.210
Yeah.

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.006
About how far
will these project?

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.091
A mile.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.718
Now, I'm building one
for you guys

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.470
that's three times
louder than this.

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:43.103
Suddenly, there's
just this amazing sound.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.522
You can't hear that?

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:53.572
We've taken inspiration from
ocean creatures, like plankton,

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.908
cuttlefish, that use the light
as a communication device

01:14:56.993 --> 01:15:00.787
or a camouflage, and added an
electro-luminescent paint job.

01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.122
lncredible.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.623
With the mobile projection,

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.167
we can go anywhere
we want with it.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:08.336
We can take it to the highways.
We can take it to big buildings.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:09.838
We can take it to the streets.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.966
And we'll be able to project
CO2 emissions in real time

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.260
out of the projector
of the back of the vehicle

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.469
while Leilani's driving.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:18.763
So, that's legal.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.473
That's legal?

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:21.641
Until you push that.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:24.978
That works, right?

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:26.688
That's legal.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.273
Okay, it's ready to go, boss.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.609
My feeling is that

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.987
by bringing nature to the city,

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.990
we're hopefully able
to inspire people

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.117
to actually help save
these creatures.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.878
There's a lot of
species that need protection.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.423
Most species that are deserving
never get listed.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.385
After a four-year campaign,

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.556
we finally managed
to get mantas on the docket

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.184
at the 201 3 CITES meeting.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.311
So, what l want to
show you here is a video

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.562
that shows what we're doing.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:10.565
Most people say,
you can't beat money.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.275
You can't beat politics.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.653
You can't beat those things
with just hope and inspiration.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:17.614
We have to make it
socially unacceptable

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:18.907
to consume these animals.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.700
I think we live in
a very visual world.

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:23.787
Imagery is very powerful.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:26.957
'Cause you can walk into a room,

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.750
they might speak
1 5 different languages.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:33.088
But you show them a photograph,
people get it. They understand.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.965
"Supping on
conservation soup."

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:38.385
There we go.
There's the Hong Kong rooftop.

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.622
Copy that.
Let's just go for it now.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.710
-You got your seat belt on?
-Yeah.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.173
Let's take a right.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.262
Just keep on going,
keep on going.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.060
Good.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:36.901
So, what are you filming
in the vehicle?

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.446
lt's a light
on top of the vehicle.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:40.572
So, what are you documenting?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.533
Yeah. And we're getting shots
in industrial areas.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.826
Why industrial areas?

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:47.996
The reflections on the car
look prettier.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.748
You might want to do it
somewhere else.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.583
What if we photograph
your smoke?

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.293
That's not smoke.

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:54.836
What is it?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.004
That's steam.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:57.630
So, if we film your steam,
is that okay?

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:58.798
No.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:04.721
I want people to understand that
we're the only generation left

01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:06.765
that can save these animals.

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:11.227
There's no other future generation
that we can count on to save us.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.188
It's us.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:35.794
Yes!

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.467
The only way
you're gonna effect change

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.968
in a remote community
like Lamakera

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:46.805
is to present an alternative.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.850
With the CITES victory,

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.978
we succeeded in getting manta
rays listed for protection,

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:58.274
which led to a national ban
on all fisheries for manta rays

01:18:58.359 --> 01:18:59.567
throughout all of Indonesia.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:01.361
In fact,
it's illegal to even harm one,

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.488
and it can result in
up to a year in prison.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.283
That law,
it creates new possibilities.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.454
Yeah. That's our theater.
Yeah. Projector.

01:19:11.539 --> 01:19:15.291
And, then,
where is the electric?

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.794
And in the world
of conservation,

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.798
those small opportunities and those
small doorways that you open

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:25.176
often lead to
those breakthrough moments.

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:33.852
Now, whether it works,
that's the next step.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:49.719
Lamakera.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.391
There's our village.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:14.118
We want them to get
an entirely new view,

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.120
that the stuff they
go out in the water

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.830
and they see every day
and they stick a spear in

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.542
is worth far more
alive than dead.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:27.632
The concept of converting
this hunting culture

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.593
to a tourism culture, on
the surface, seems pretty daunting,

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:36.224
but we show them the success stories
that we've had in these other areas.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.311
Places in the world
that had very little

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.396
and now are thriving.

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:53.658
These kids are gonna
be really influenced by this,

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.994
and they're gonna be
the guides of the future.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.790
We're just bringing a message.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.586
It's really up to them.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.482
Something's up in the air.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.285
Oh, nice.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.045
We can make this happen.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.300
As we face more
and more animal extinctions,

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:56.179
we need more and more
of these indomitable spirits.

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:05.521
And we need more people
to understand it's worth doing.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.070
The small choices
we make each day

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.407
can lead to the kind of world
that we all want for the future.

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.195
Away from

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.991
One million miles away

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.535
From home

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.954
Away from

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:48.624
One million miles away

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.418
There was a reverend in Japan.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.796
He had a statement
which really struck me,

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:58.301
and it was "Better to light one
candle than curse the darkness."

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:06.142
There's so many people who sit back
and say,"We're screwed,"

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.186
or, you know, "Why bother?"

01:25:12.733 --> 01:25:13.733
But you know what?

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.402
That candle,
that candle means something,

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.073
because with that one candle,

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.784
maybe someone else
with a candle will find you.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.623
And I think that's where
movements are started.

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:42.261
I know it all sounds
overwhelming.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.184
But if we start with just one
thing, we can start a movement.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.438
Two hands

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.817
Spirit give me two hands

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.110
Humans

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:01.656
Humans making humans

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:03.699
Mountains

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:07.328
Maybe we can move them

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:12.750
Come now, together we can do this

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:17.171
Together, we can

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:22.468
Take my hand

01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:24.470
Now I won't stand around the dark

01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:28.266
Together we can

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:31.352
Light your candles and stand

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.646
For those who came
Before man

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.481
Now I won't stand around the dark

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:37.275
Better to light one candle

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:43.865
Than curse the darkness

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.995
Better to light one candle

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:54.834
Than curse the darkness

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.088
And breathing

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:03.009
Give thanks for they have given

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:04.468
Listen

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.431
To all the songs I'm singing

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:12.894
We can do something or do nothing

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.730
So come now

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:19.567
Strike the match,
Let's do this

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:23.905
Together, we can

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:28.993
Take my hand

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.037
Now I won't stand around the dark

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:34.957
Together, we can

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:37.376
Light our candles and stand

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.046
For those that came before man

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:41.797
Now I won't stand around the dark

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:44.091
Better to light one candle

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:50.222
Than curse the darkness

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:55.227
Oh, better to light
One candle

01:27:56.605 --> 01:28:01.275
Than curse the darkness

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:07.239
Oh, better to light one candle

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:12.703
Than curse the darkness

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.667
Oh, better to light
One candle

01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:21.128
Than curse the darkness

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.768
In the trees

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.984
'Tween the leaves

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:48.781
All the growing

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:54.286
That we did

01:28:54.788 --> 01:29:00.960
All the loving

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:07.049
And separating

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:14.140
All the turning

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:17.643
To face

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:22.064
Each other

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:30.489
I divide

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.871
In the sky

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.211
In the seams

01:29:46.757 --> 01:29:49.008
'Tween the beams

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.597
All the loving

01:29:56.516 --> 01:30:01.604
And separating

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:08.152
All the turning

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:15.326
To face each other

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:18.954
Without

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:25.419
Biodiversity

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:29.507
I'm nothing

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:33.552
Means like

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:36.472
I never

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:44.230
Existed

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:51.278
Without my heart

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:57.034
With no reflection

01:30:57.119 --> 01:31:00.704
I cease to exist

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:08.212
And my children

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:13.676
Are dying now

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:18.139
Inside me

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:20.975
My children

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:27.857
Are dying now

01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:30.901
Inside me

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:34.989
My children

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:41.078
All I love

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:44.832
All I know

01:31:45.876 --> 01:31:48.961
All I've known

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:55.092
I am dying now

01:31:56.303 --> 01:31:59.138
Inside me

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:07.855
My children

01:32:08.305 --> 01:32:14.677
