WEBVTT

00:06.103 --> 00:08.379
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:08.448 --> 00:10.896
We're having a good,
old-fashioned roast.

00:12.551 --> 00:15.000
Ross is not a top,
he's a blouse.

00:16.931 --> 00:18.758
You're so gay
that your asshole

00:18.827 --> 00:20.965
sounds like a turkey.
Blblblblbl.

00:21.034 --> 00:23.655
You know, I am terrified.

00:23.724 --> 00:27.241
Daya looks like what
a five-year-old would draw

00:27.310 --> 00:29.689
if you asked them
to draw Bigfoot.

00:31.206 --> 00:32.724
Bosco.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.793
You fucking smashed it.

00:34.862 --> 00:37.413
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:38.862 --> 00:42.793
Daya Betty, Jorgeous,
DeJa Skye,

00:42.862 --> 00:44.068
I'm sorry, my dears,

00:44.137 --> 00:48.413
but all three of you
are up for elimination.

00:49.965 --> 00:52.655
Daya Betty, shantay you stay.

00:52.724 --> 00:55.206
Oh, my God.

00:55.275 --> 00:57.931
Jorgeous, DeJa Skye,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.413
sashay away.

01:11.275 --> 01:13.482
Ugh!

01:13.551 --> 01:15.068
My God.

01:15.137 --> 01:16.482
Coming back into the werkroom,

01:16.551 --> 01:19.068
we're all really shaken up
by what just happened.

01:19.137 --> 01:22.241
This is only the third time
this has ever happened

01:22.310 --> 01:23.517
in RuPaul's Drag Race
herstory,

01:23.586 --> 01:28.310
and we're just a little bit,
mm, speechless.

01:28.379 --> 01:32.137
I did not see that
coming at all.

01:32.206 --> 01:34.379
You really did that thing
during the lip sync.

01:34.448 --> 01:36.586
I couldn't keep my eyes off you
the entire time.

01:36.655 --> 01:39.931
You guys, it was terrifying,
because with DeJa,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.413
I've been against her before,
so that was already in my head.

01:42.482 --> 01:43.586
And then Jorgeous,
of course, like--

01:43.655 --> 01:45.586
Sent home half the cast
at this point.

01:45.655 --> 01:46.793
Literally half of the cast.

01:46.862 --> 01:48.724
So I was like, this is my time.

01:48.793 --> 01:52.896
I kind of saw
a double sashay coming,

01:52.965 --> 01:56.068
because we can't have seven
people going into the finale.

01:56.137 --> 01:58.758
So I'm just happy
I'm still here.

01:59.758 --> 02:01.448
Bosco!

02:01.517 --> 02:03.379
Con-drag-ulations, bitch!

02:03.448 --> 02:04.379
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah.

02:04.448 --> 02:06.931
I feel just so renewed.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.896
I was at the absolute bottom
of the bottom,

02:09.965 --> 02:13.620
and I came back this week
and won a challenge.

02:13.689 --> 02:16.655
And that feels fucking lit.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.137
Yeah!

02:19.206 --> 02:20.965
Where do we stack up
now with wins?

02:21.034 --> 02:23.448
How many does everyone have?

02:23.517 --> 02:24.620
I've got three.

02:24.689 --> 02:25.862
I have two.

02:25.931 --> 02:27.793
-I have two.
-I have one.

02:27.862 --> 02:29.103
I have one.
At this point,

02:29.172 --> 02:30.965
I think everyone
has an equal chance.

02:31.034 --> 02:33.551
We've all gotten praise
and we've all won challenges,

02:33.620 --> 02:35.137
and that's what makes it
so confusing.

02:35.206 --> 02:38.896
There's no fifth person that's
like, oh, we can just boot her.

02:38.965 --> 02:41.758
It's, like, I can see
a final four of any combination.

02:41.827 --> 02:43.931
Just keep having fun.
You made it this far.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.344
I need a diaper.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.034
Top five, hey!

02:50.482 --> 02:52.344
I love for my sisters,
but, baby,

02:52.413 --> 02:54.689
everybody is gunning
for that top four.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.275
Oh!

02:56.344 --> 02:57.655
That's sexy, honestly.

02:57.724 --> 03:00.655
Like, we want it, we feel it,
we can taste it.

03:00.724 --> 03:02.827
So what you do this week

03:02.896 --> 03:05.793
is going to determine
if you are going all the way.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.206
Oh, what is that?

03:10.517 --> 03:11.793
-Chicken tender?
-Eew, no!

03:11.862 --> 03:14.586
I'm hungry now.

03:16.793 --> 03:18.379
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:18.448 --> 03:19.896
receives a one-year supply

03:19.965 --> 03:22.137
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:22.206 --> 03:27.793
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

03:37.413 --> 03:39.482
Na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na.

03:39.551 --> 03:41.586
Na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.034
-Final five!
-Yes!

03:44.103 --> 03:46.344
So happy!

03:46.413 --> 03:48.793
To be top five is nuts.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.448
There are no words to describe
what I'm feeling right now.

03:52.517 --> 03:55.413
Like, literally,
it is just such a dream.

03:55.482 --> 03:57.310
Oh, my goodness.

03:57.379 --> 03:59.310
-I think it's herstory, girl.
-Yeah.

03:59.379 --> 04:01.896
First top five with two people
that got eliminated.

04:05.586 --> 04:09.275
Yeah, you can talk about
this lip sync all you want.

04:10.689 --> 04:12.344
Hello, hello, hello!

04:12.413 --> 04:13.931
Here we go!

04:14.000 --> 04:15.689
Hey, dolls.

04:17.206 --> 04:18.827
My ferocious five.

04:18.896 --> 04:21.586
You know,
it's been a bumpy ride,

04:21.655 --> 04:24.000
but looking
at your beautiful faces

04:24.068 --> 04:28.034
and knowing how hard
you all fought to get here,

04:28.103 --> 04:31.310
if I had to live this season
all over again,

04:31.379 --> 04:32.896
I wouldn't change a thing.

04:34.137 --> 04:37.310
This week, for your
final maxi-challenge,

04:37.379 --> 04:42.034
you need to sell your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

04:42.103 --> 04:46.551
as the stars
of the music video Catwalk.

04:49.586 --> 04:53.931
Taking inspiration from George
Michael's Too Funkyvideo,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.034
Catwalkcelebrates
that rare species known as...

05:00.103 --> 05:02.586
the supermodel.

05:02.655 --> 05:05.586
First, you'll write and record
your own original lyrics.

05:05.655 --> 05:07.551
Then, you'll work

05:07.620 --> 05:10.896
with Drag Racechoreographer
Miguel Zarate.

05:12.551 --> 05:13.931
Last but not least,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.965
you'll design
your own Catwalkcouture

05:17.034 --> 05:18.896
to be featured in the video.

05:18.965 --> 05:22.034
Oh, and you are also
cordially invited

05:22.103 --> 05:24.482
to join Michelle Visage and me

05:24.551 --> 05:28.103
for an intimate
Tic-Tac Chit-Chat.

05:28.172 --> 05:29.931
Ooh!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.896
Kitty girls,
if you wanna make it

05:31.965 --> 05:35.896
to the grand finale
of RuPaul's Drag Race,

05:35.965 --> 05:38.000
girl, you need to slay
this music video.

05:38.068 --> 05:40.758
Today is the day, bitch.

05:40.827 --> 05:43.448
I don't care how good you have
been doing up until this point.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.068
You could be out of here today.

05:45.137 --> 05:48.068
Racers, start your engines,

05:48.137 --> 05:50.310
and may the best drag queen win.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.689
-We have a lot to do today.
-Yeah.

05:55.758 --> 05:57.000
The main goal for this

05:57.068 --> 06:00.620
is to express ourselves
in our truest form

06:00.689 --> 06:04.862
while showing how fierce of
a supermodel bitch that we are.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.000
Let me see what you got.

06:07.068 --> 06:07.965
I'm trying to go for,
like, a sort of under--

06:08.034 --> 06:09.103
Ooh!

06:09.172 --> 06:10.448
Like, an underground
raver fairy.

06:10.517 --> 06:11.689
I see that for you.

06:11.758 --> 06:13.448
So we have to design a look

06:13.517 --> 06:16.000
that is going to be made
by a designer for us to wear,

06:16.068 --> 06:18.034
and I kind of wanna channel

06:18.103 --> 06:20.931
kind of a vibe that the judges
haven't really seen yet.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.379
A little bit more of that
underground nightclub,

06:23.448 --> 06:27.310
Camden Town, messed-up
Tinker Bell kind of vibe.

06:27.379 --> 06:29.068
What are you wearing today?

06:29.137 --> 06:30.379
I'm doing something like her.

06:30.448 --> 06:31.793
Oh, cute.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.241
I'm feeling, like, very,
like, structured catsuit,

06:34.310 --> 06:35.724
no panties and corsets.

06:35.793 --> 06:38.413
I want to channel
Miss Linda Evangelista,

06:38.482 --> 06:40.586
because she's just the one.

06:40.655 --> 06:44.827
Bosco, what is your approach
for writing your verse?

06:44.896 --> 06:46.620
I'm trying to,
like, very much keep it

06:46.689 --> 06:49.586
within who Bosco is
as a character.

06:49.655 --> 06:52.206
Bosco comes from
a very, like, devilish place,

06:52.275 --> 06:53.482
so I think it'd be fun
to start out

06:53.551 --> 06:56.068
with me doing
a little bit of penance.

06:56.137 --> 06:57.793
Father, forgive me

06:57.862 --> 07:00.310
for only wearing corsets
and panties on the runway.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.896
Just being hot bitch,
hot, irreverent bitch.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.620
Come on, hot bitch.

07:04.689 --> 07:05.827
Angie, you sing, though.

07:05.896 --> 07:07.103
Like, do you feel
pretty confident

07:07.172 --> 07:09.275
about writing lyrics
and singing and stuff?

07:09.344 --> 07:13.103
I actually don't think
I'm going to sing.

07:13.172 --> 07:14.310
-Ooh.
-Nice.

07:14.379 --> 07:16.068
Yeah, I'm thinking
about rapping it.

07:16.137 --> 07:19.482
Now, I am not Lil' Kim
or nothin',

07:19.551 --> 07:22.896
but, bitch, we gonna be
Lil' Angie today.

07:22.965 --> 07:25.724
-Give us a hit.
-A taste.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.448
From the country
to the silver screen,

07:27.517 --> 07:29.862
it's Angie, bitch,
living out my dream.

07:29.931 --> 07:31.103
That's cute!

07:31.172 --> 07:32.241
-Oh, you like that?
-That is so cute!

07:32.310 --> 07:34.793
Okay. Aah!

07:34.862 --> 07:36.482
I think I'm almost done,
actually.

07:36.551 --> 07:38.103
Can I hear
your first two lines?

07:38.172 --> 07:40.103
-No.
-Aah!

07:40.172 --> 07:42.068
Oh, that means that they're
really, really good, then,

07:42.137 --> 07:43.551
if I have to wait for them.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.896
Yeah, or I'm stalling.

07:45.965 --> 07:50.137
Being honest, I really could see
anyone being in the top.

07:50.206 --> 07:54.448
But Willow and I
are very, very close,

07:54.517 --> 07:58.344
and I want Willow and I
to be in the finale together.

07:58.413 --> 08:00.103
I'm just gonna scat.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.275
Scabba-doo-be-doo-bah-boo-baow!

08:04.344 --> 08:06.793
The race is unbelievably tight.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.586
All of the girls
have the skill sets

08:09.655 --> 08:11.758
to kill this
music video challenge.

08:11.827 --> 08:13.482
Lady Camden won the Rusical,

08:13.551 --> 08:15.517
Daya won
the girl group challenge,

08:15.586 --> 08:17.862
Angie is a lovely performer
and singer,

08:17.931 --> 08:20.862
and Willow has the ability
to set herself apart

08:20.931 --> 08:23.103
and is very quick
at picking up choreography.

08:23.172 --> 08:26.965
To get to that top four, I'm
gonna have to be a superstar,

08:27.034 --> 08:31.758
and I'm keeping my eyes on that
finish line this entire time.

08:32.896 --> 08:34.137
Coming up...

08:34.206 --> 08:36.448
Here you are in the top five.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.000
You know what? I saw myself
being here for sure.

08:38.068 --> 08:39.689
I did not.

08:48.482 --> 08:50.482
-Oh, my gosh.
-Hi!

08:50.551 --> 08:52.379
-It's Bosco.
-It's me.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.827
And you've got a slit
all the way up.

08:53.896 --> 08:55.310
All the way up.

08:55.379 --> 08:58.000
Oh, my. What are you gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?

08:58.068 --> 09:00.000
-Ooh.

09:00.068 --> 09:02.137
It's time for my Tic-Tac lunch
with Ru and Michelle,

09:02.206 --> 09:03.896
and I'm so excited.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.586
Are you surprised you're here?

09:05.655 --> 09:08.206
No, I'm not surprised
that I'm here.

09:08.275 --> 09:11.517
I felt really strong
coming into the competition.

09:11.586 --> 09:13.000
There was a little bit
of a stumble.

09:13.068 --> 09:14.413
Yes.

09:14.482 --> 09:18.000
But it feels really freeing
to, like fuck it up

09:18.068 --> 09:20.206
and then move forward from that.

09:20.275 --> 09:21.827
Isn't that the secret of life,
though?

09:21.896 --> 09:24.310
Once you've died
to your old self,

09:24.379 --> 09:26.000
then you can be reborn

09:26.068 --> 09:28.034
into the self that
you were supposed to be.

09:28.103 --> 09:29.413
A lot of people have to fall.

09:29.482 --> 09:30.724
Sometimes they find religion.

09:30.793 --> 09:32.862
So you've heard of
born-again Christianity.

09:32.931 --> 09:34.517
This is born-again
drag-ontology.

09:34.586 --> 09:38.068
We went all that way
for that joke.

09:38.137 --> 09:41.172
Sorry.

09:41.241 --> 09:45.931
So have you accomplished
what you came here to do?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.689
Yes, you wore all your bras
and panties and corsets.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.965
Not yet, because
my goal coming into this

09:53.034 --> 09:54.689
was to walk away with the crown.

09:54.758 --> 09:59.965
But I am so happy with
what I have done so far.

10:00.034 --> 10:04.620
I have won three
comedy-based challenges,

10:04.689 --> 10:07.379
and, like, I did not
see that coming.

10:07.448 --> 10:09.413
Three comedy challenges and,
like, the reading challenge.

10:09.482 --> 10:12.206
My ability to shit
on my fellow competitors

10:12.275 --> 10:14.586
has brought me several wins
at this point.

10:16.448 --> 10:19.655
You're a natural,
and through this process

10:19.724 --> 10:23.068
you'll peel away
more layers of who you are.

10:23.137 --> 10:24.931
It feels like
I'm connecting with them

10:25.000 --> 10:27.758
in a way that, like, okay,
they see me as a human being

10:27.827 --> 10:31.724
behind that drag persona,
and it feels great.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.862
Well, look who's here.

10:34.931 --> 10:37.482
-Hello!
-Daya Betty!

10:37.551 --> 10:40.000
-Hi, guys.
-Here you are in the top five.

10:40.068 --> 10:41.344
You know what? I saw myself
being here for sure.

10:41.413 --> 10:42.758
-You did?
-I did. I am not gonna lie.

10:42.827 --> 10:45.379
I did not.

10:45.448 --> 10:46.655
Ru is already reading me.

10:46.724 --> 10:48.310
I'll tell you why.

10:48.379 --> 10:50.793
Because I was getting
so much of El DeBarge.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.482
-Oh, yeah.
-Crystal Methyd, yeah.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.034
But I saw it break through
in Daytona Wind.

10:55.103 --> 10:57.586
The acting
and the character development,

10:57.655 --> 10:58.724
it was fully realized.

10:58.793 --> 11:02.000
So, Daya Betty,
are you diabetic?

11:02.068 --> 11:03.310
I am diabetic.
I'm a type 1 diabetic.

11:03.379 --> 11:06.862
I found out that
I had it when I was 15.

11:06.931 --> 11:10.000
I was in the shower one morning
and I felt really sick.

11:10.068 --> 11:12.965
I screamed for my mom to
come get me out of the shower,

11:13.034 --> 11:14.517
because I felt like
I couldn't move.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.000
And they rushed me
to the hospital,

11:16.068 --> 11:18.206
and it was good old diabetes.

11:18.275 --> 11:20.551
So that must be hard for you,
being in a competition,

11:20.620 --> 11:22.206
because it's so dependent

11:22.275 --> 11:24.241
upon what your blood sugar
is doing.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.034
Sometimes I can feel
when I'm getting low,

11:26.103 --> 11:27.379
like my blood sugar's
getting low,

11:27.448 --> 11:29.103
and sometimes
I can feel when it's high.

11:29.172 --> 11:32.000
When I'm in full drag,
I have pads on and a corset,

11:32.068 --> 11:35.551
and I'm having to keep
my insulin pump hidden

11:35.620 --> 11:37.758
and tucked away in my outfits.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.620
So it's kind of
this juggling game

11:40.689 --> 11:42.896
that I have to be
really cognitive of.

11:42.965 --> 11:44.517
Drink your juice, Shelby.

11:44.586 --> 11:45.793
You beat me to that line.

11:45.862 --> 11:47.034
I was waiting for--

11:47.103 --> 11:48.517
Say it, say it.

11:48.586 --> 11:49.827
Drink your juice, Shelby.

11:49.896 --> 11:51.172
-Drink your juice.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.310
Drink your juice, Shelby.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.827
You clearly are thriving now.

11:56.896 --> 11:59.517
It kind of showed me

11:59.586 --> 12:02.413
things just happen in your life
you have no control over,

12:02.482 --> 12:04.310
and you either
let it get you down

12:04.379 --> 12:07.344
or you use it to the best
of your abilities.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.034
-That's what life is.
-Yeah.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.379
Face those fears.

12:10.448 --> 12:11.551
They don't become fears anymore,

12:11.620 --> 12:14.620
they become an opening,
a big opening.

12:16.034 --> 12:18.275
Dive right into that
big old opening.

12:18.344 --> 12:21.620
I've never felt this calm

12:21.689 --> 12:25.482
after leaving a conversation
with Ru or Michelle.

12:25.551 --> 12:27.413
It kind of gives you
that fuel that you need,

12:27.482 --> 12:28.827
that extra lift

12:28.896 --> 12:31.896
to get through the remainder
of the competition.

12:31.965 --> 12:34.965
This is the Tic-Tac Chit-Chat,

12:35.034 --> 12:39.896
and you won the Tic-Tac
challenge your first episode.

12:39.965 --> 12:42.655
It seems like so long ago.

12:42.724 --> 12:44.689
You're a drag mother
to eight kids?

12:44.758 --> 12:45.896
Yes.

12:45.965 --> 12:46.827
So you can't really
come into this

12:46.896 --> 12:48.586
with anything but confidence,

12:48.655 --> 12:51.137
because back home you've got
these kids who look up to you.

12:51.206 --> 12:54.482
Yeah, that was one of the things
that was in the back of my mind,

12:54.551 --> 12:57.448
my drag kids,
my actual parents.

12:57.517 --> 13:01.000
Like, just the fact
of not letting people down.

13:01.068 --> 13:02.482
Your parents,
are they supportive of you

13:02.551 --> 13:04.310
and your drag career?

13:04.379 --> 13:09.310
Yes. They are, like, my two,
like, biggest supporters.

13:09.379 --> 13:10.793
They've been, like, getting into
it the past couple of seasons.

13:10.862 --> 13:12.379
Oh, I love it.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.965
My mom feels like she's
a whole Drag Raceexpert now.

13:15.034 --> 13:17.379
So she be like,
"Ooh, Lil' Bodie, they--"

13:17.448 --> 13:19.172
That's what they call me,
they call me Lil' Bodie.

13:19.241 --> 13:21.827
-Lil' Bodie?
-Yeah, my mom is always like,

13:21.896 --> 13:24.137
"Okay, Lil' Bodie, you know
you gotta make her laugh now.

13:24.206 --> 13:26.586
"And make sure you look art.

13:26.655 --> 13:28.482
"Whatever you do,
make sure it's art.

13:28.551 --> 13:30.896
Make her fall in love with you
and look art."

13:32.103 --> 13:35.034
Well, we've all
fallen in love with you.

13:35.103 --> 13:36.827
You're very, very charming.

13:36.896 --> 13:38.206
And we got that

13:38.275 --> 13:40.827
from the very first moment
we laid eyes on you.

13:40.896 --> 13:43.862
You are a genuine,
lovely, kind person.

13:43.931 --> 13:45.586
Don't change any of that.

13:45.655 --> 13:46.620
Remember where
you came from, baby.

13:46.689 --> 13:47.896
Remember where you came from.

13:47.965 --> 13:49.482
Thank you.

13:49.551 --> 13:52.620
I feel like we've all developed
this sense of comfortability--

13:52.689 --> 13:53.655
Is that a word?

13:53.724 --> 13:56.448
Comfortability--I don't--

13:56.517 --> 13:58.206
It honestly just felt like

13:58.275 --> 14:02.379
I was having a lunch date
with two of my aunties.

14:02.448 --> 14:03.896
All right, go on back
and fix your outfit.

14:03.965 --> 14:05.172
All right, Mama.

14:06.241 --> 14:07.310
All right, Auntie Shelle.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.896
Bye, Angie, baby.

14:08.965 --> 14:11.000
Nuh-uh, she don't want
no big pill.

14:11.068 --> 14:13.517
Hello, my darlings.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.034
Listen, throughout
this competition

14:16.103 --> 14:20.551
I've commented on
your take on life

14:20.620 --> 14:22.448
and how much I admire it.

14:22.517 --> 14:27.034
Have you had other people
comment on your ability

14:27.103 --> 14:30.103
to laugh in the face
of adversity?

14:30.172 --> 14:31.344
Yeah, I think it's what

14:31.413 --> 14:33.068
I've really become known for
in Denver.

14:33.137 --> 14:37.344
And as much as my drag
comes from a lot of queerness,

14:37.413 --> 14:40.793
a lot of it has to do more
with conquering death

14:40.862 --> 14:42.034
in some weird way.

14:42.103 --> 14:45.448
I wanna ask how much
your cystinosis--

14:45.517 --> 14:46.862
-Is that what it is?
-Mm-hmm.

14:46.931 --> 14:49.689
How much has that impacted you
every single day?

14:49.758 --> 14:53.965
I think the main way it's
impacted me is with my hands.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.827
It's just the atrophy
of the hands.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.034
But, I mean, everything you do

14:58.103 --> 14:59.689
when you have, like,
a disability like that,

14:59.758 --> 15:01.275
you just learn to do it
in a different way.

15:01.344 --> 15:03.827
So I use my teeth all the time
for everything.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.172
I use--when I do my makeup,

15:05.241 --> 15:07.896
I move with my elbow
instead of my fingers.

15:07.965 --> 15:11.724
And so you just learn
little ways to make shortcuts.

15:11.793 --> 15:14.551
What do you want out of life
moving forward?

15:14.620 --> 15:16.206
I think for a long time

15:16.275 --> 15:20.344
I really wanted to make,
like, a monument of my drag,

15:20.413 --> 15:22.793
and that comes from

15:22.862 --> 15:27.379
constantly feeling like
you're letting go of everything

15:27.448 --> 15:29.965
and wanting to, like,
attach yourself to life,

15:30.034 --> 15:31.793
because it's, like,
slipping away from you.

15:31.862 --> 15:37.724
I'm just finally learning
to just enjoy life,

15:37.793 --> 15:41.551
and that is a hard thing to do.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.275
You should create
a superhero called Sister Nosis.

15:45.344 --> 15:49.551
Because most people
will succumb to their illness

15:49.620 --> 15:51.379
and think of themselves
as a victim.

15:51.448 --> 15:53.034
I don't think of you
as a victim at all.

15:53.103 --> 15:55.068
I feel so proud.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.137
I've done things here
that I'll remember forever.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.137
I'm not quite sure
what the future looks like

15:59.206 --> 16:00.724
as far as someone
with my illness.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.172
I wanna live it up now.

16:02.241 --> 16:05.137
I want to be a drag rock star.

16:05.206 --> 16:08.758
I don't wanna leave this world
with any box unchecked.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.965
Lady Camden.

16:12.034 --> 16:13.620
Hello, you beautiful people.

16:13.689 --> 16:15.724
Here you are.

16:15.793 --> 16:17.620
How have you changed
in this competition?

16:17.689 --> 16:20.448
I think what I've learned,
maybe, in this competition

16:20.517 --> 16:23.448
is that any of the risks
that I've taken on the runway

16:23.517 --> 16:25.758
or in the challenges are the
things that paid off the most.

16:25.827 --> 16:28.241
-Yeah.
-Do you have siblings?

16:28.310 --> 16:32.551
Yeah, my brother, um,
unfortunately committed suicide

16:32.620 --> 16:35.448
when I was about 14
and he was 21.

16:35.517 --> 16:39.068
So it was a hard time,
and I think for that reason,

16:39.137 --> 16:43.551
um, I was kind of keen
to leave England.

16:43.620 --> 16:47.862
And, um, I just never felt like
I wanted to go back,

16:47.931 --> 16:49.172
because I just felt like

16:49.241 --> 16:51.827
it was a physically
very dark place to be.

16:51.896 --> 16:53.241
Have you resolved all of that,

16:53.310 --> 16:56.310
all of the sort of darkness
you left behind?

16:56.379 --> 16:57.517
Um...

16:57.586 --> 16:58.413
Because you can't
run away from it.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.103
I know.

17:00.172 --> 17:02.482
I think even just saying it
out loud makes me realize

17:02.551 --> 17:05.724
I have a fear of kind of
going back and settling there.

17:05.793 --> 17:08.275
It just kind of
brings up memories

17:08.344 --> 17:10.034
of a time where I felt like

17:10.103 --> 17:13.172
I just didn't know,
really, what to do.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.896
Looking back,
it was a lot to deal with.

17:15.965 --> 17:18.620
But I felt like
it was my responsibility

17:18.689 --> 17:21.931
to kind of
keep everyone together

17:22.000 --> 17:23.241
and keep everyone happy.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.344
So how has that motivated you

17:25.413 --> 17:28.862
or pushed you
into doing what you do?

17:28.931 --> 17:33.448
I've wanted to have a moment
of "just you wait," you know?

17:33.517 --> 17:36.310
Like, I'll go away,
and I'm gonna do my thing,

17:36.379 --> 17:37.896
and I'm gonna come back

17:37.965 --> 17:43.413
and, you know, just make you
so crazy proud.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.517
Whew.

17:46.793 --> 17:48.344
There's a small
handful of people

17:48.413 --> 17:51.103
that know that I get in my way
and that know I doubt myself,

17:51.172 --> 17:53.379
and that I know I get shy
and maybe shut down,

17:53.448 --> 17:54.931
and that I've hardened myself

17:55.000 --> 17:56.241
because of what
I've been through in my life.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.655
There's a few people at home

17:57.724 --> 17:59.965
that knew I could get
the whole way,

18:00.034 --> 18:03.103
and I cannot wait
for them to find out.

18:03.172 --> 18:04.310
All right,
thank you, Lady Camden.

18:04.379 --> 18:05.965
-Thank you guys so much.
-Thank you.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.034
Coming up...

18:08.103 --> 18:10.172
-Catwalk.
-Ooh.

18:10.241 --> 18:12.068
-Everybody.
-So fast.

18:12.137 --> 18:14.620
Here's the real deal.
It's time to roll on it.

18:14.689 --> 18:16.103
Bring in the backup dancers!

18:16.172 --> 18:17.551
Oh, my God.

18:29.586 --> 18:33.241
Oh, my goodness!
Look, our costumes!

18:33.310 --> 18:34.793
Wow! We got clothes!

18:34.862 --> 18:36.068
Today is music video day.

18:36.137 --> 18:38.137
So we walk in
and at our stations

18:38.206 --> 18:40.172
are all of the outfits
that we designed.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.206
I'm so happy!

18:42.275 --> 18:44.689
Oh, here she is, bitch.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.310
She has arrived!

18:46.379 --> 18:47.655
Velociraptor realness.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.551
Oh, this is fun!

18:49.620 --> 18:50.965
I love it.

18:51.034 --> 18:52.517
Werk, bitch.

18:52.586 --> 18:54.448
It's all one piece.

18:54.517 --> 18:56.241
This is gonna be kind of
difficult to get into,

18:56.310 --> 18:58.068
because I'm gonna have to
step into the whole thing.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.517
But I'm really excited
to see what it looks like

19:00.586 --> 19:03.379
when it all
is on my big old body.

19:03.448 --> 19:07.206
Oh, I feel very superhero-y
here, actually.

19:07.275 --> 19:10.000
Bosco's outfit
is perfectly made.

19:10.068 --> 19:11.931
It's just
I don't think she imagined

19:12.000 --> 19:16.758
that it would look like
a soccer mom in space.

19:22.655 --> 19:25.862
-Hey, queens.
-Hello.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.000
So it's time to learn
our choreography

19:28.068 --> 19:30.758
with Miguel Zarate and Michelle
Visage coaching as well.

19:30.827 --> 19:32.482
Honestly, like,
I love to perform,

19:32.551 --> 19:34.931
I love to learn
sassy choreography,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.896
and I'm feeling like
whatever happens,

19:36.965 --> 19:39.241
I'm gonna have a really
good time on that catwalk.

19:39.310 --> 19:43.068
You're playing catty supermodels
battling for the spotlight.

19:43.137 --> 19:48.068
I made music videos
a long, long time ago.

19:48.137 --> 19:52.344
It was always very fast-paced,
and guess what?

19:52.413 --> 19:55.000
It's gonna be
just like that here today.

19:57.172 --> 19:59.137
I am having butterflies,

19:59.206 --> 20:02.172
because I'm not
a choreography girl.

20:02.241 --> 20:04.724
My memory and my feet
do not be on the same page.

20:04.793 --> 20:09.000
And this is the last impression.
I need it to be good.

20:09.068 --> 20:10.241
We're gonna start.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.896
One, two.
You're gonna jump out.

20:12.965 --> 20:16.620
Three, to the right,
to the left.

20:16.689 --> 20:17.689
It's almost like a dab-dab.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.206
It is like dab-dab.

20:19.275 --> 20:21.000
Yes, with two fists.

20:21.068 --> 20:24.448
One, two,
jump, three and four.

20:24.517 --> 20:27.103
From there, you're gonna
ball-change right, left.

20:27.172 --> 20:30.586
You're gonna move your hips
left, right, left.

20:30.655 --> 20:32.724
Everybody...

20:32.793 --> 20:35.275
From here, you're gonna
put your right foot in.

20:35.344 --> 20:36.689
I am on the struggle bus,

20:36.758 --> 20:38.655
and I'm the only one
on there by myself.

20:38.724 --> 20:42.000
Everybody knows
you're somebody.

20:42.068 --> 20:43.172
The way you--

20:43.241 --> 20:46.000
Everywhere you go. Hold.

20:46.068 --> 20:47.172
Angie, what's going on?

20:49.034 --> 20:50.413
You're being too hard
on yourself, aren't you?

20:50.482 --> 20:52.275
Don't go there.

20:52.344 --> 20:53.482
Bring back Sparta.

20:53.551 --> 20:54.896
Take it from the top.

20:54.965 --> 20:59.620
This catwalk everywhere you go.

20:59.689 --> 21:02.275
Everybody, dab.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.655
I'm feeling for Angie right now.

21:03.724 --> 21:05.896
I just wanna, like,
telecommunicate with her

21:05.965 --> 21:07.413
and be, like, come on, girl,
you can get it.

21:07.482 --> 21:09.448
Please?
It's a kick, ball change.

21:09.517 --> 21:10.896
You're the star,

21:10.965 --> 21:12.965
and, like, we all know the stars
never do it right fully.

21:14.586 --> 21:17.448
So you do what you need to do
to get through the combo.

21:17.517 --> 21:19.344
Don't get stuck on a move.

21:19.413 --> 21:22.413
Five, six, hit 'em
with your catwalk.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.655
Everywhere you go,

21:24.724 --> 21:29.551
and everybody knows
you're somebody.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.310
Much better.

21:31.379 --> 21:32.827
-You can do this.
-Much better.

21:32.896 --> 21:34.689
-All of y'all can do this.
-Everybody's looking great.

21:34.758 --> 21:36.137
Ladies, I wanna remind you

21:36.206 --> 21:38.655
that dancing is just one
component of this challenge.

21:38.724 --> 21:40.551
It's selling it.

21:40.620 --> 21:41.965
But here's the real deal.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.758
It's time to roll on it.

21:44.862 --> 21:46.655
Bring in the backup dancers,
please.

21:49.448 --> 21:51.689
Oh, so we're filming right now.

21:51.758 --> 21:53.482
Like, right now, right now?

21:54.793 --> 21:56.137
Oh, my God.

21:56.206 --> 21:57.724
What I have to do right now

21:57.793 --> 22:02.068
is I gotta put all of these
demons to the back of my mind.

22:02.137 --> 22:03.586
Like, girl, they gotta
get up outta there.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.206
I gotta go up on that stage,
and I gotta pull this off.

22:07.896 --> 22:09.241
Let's do this!

22:09.310 --> 22:11.241
Hit it!

22:27.655 --> 22:29.413
-I live.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.896
Angeria, you did
the opening dance move,

22:31.965 --> 22:33.724
and you did
the closing dance move,

22:33.793 --> 22:36.206
but you sold it in between.

22:36.275 --> 22:38.482
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22:38.551 --> 22:40.724
That's my move.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.344
Bitch, that's about the only
move I could remember.

22:43.413 --> 22:47.965
All right, ladies, it's time
to move on to your solo moments.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.689
-Aah!
-Bosco, you're up first.

22:50.758 --> 22:51.965
Okay.

22:52.034 --> 22:54.379
I wanna see
fashion modeling, posing.

22:54.448 --> 22:56.620
Don't be afraid
to walk the runway.

22:56.689 --> 22:58.172
-Okay.
-Action!

23:01.620 --> 23:05.034
Werk!

23:05.103 --> 23:06.758
Bosco is doing really well,

23:06.827 --> 23:10.758
and giving you that real catwalk
attitude at the same time.

23:10.827 --> 23:13.344
I just am very thankful
that she's in that outfit,

23:13.413 --> 23:15.241
because it's like
an intergalactic mom

23:15.310 --> 23:16.620
ready to pick up her kids.

23:18.068 --> 23:20.206
Willow, first of all,

23:20.275 --> 23:21.482
is that your profile
on your dress?

23:21.551 --> 23:22.724
Uh-huh.

23:22.793 --> 23:24.068
That is so cool.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.241
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, wow, I just noticed that.

23:25.310 --> 23:27.448
Yeah, it's pretty rad.
I love that.

23:27.517 --> 23:28.827
Okay, let's go for it.

23:32.241 --> 23:36.379
I'm trying to give very,
like, Betsey Johnson energy,

23:36.448 --> 23:37.620
very flirty and flouncy,

23:37.689 --> 23:39.827
a little bit of
Anna Nicole in there.

23:39.896 --> 23:43.931
Willow is the sleepiest
supermodel of all time.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.517
She's giving us moves, but
there's a bit of a disconnect

23:47.586 --> 23:48.965
from, like,
what's happening here

23:49.034 --> 23:50.344
and what's happening
down there.

23:52.620 --> 23:54.000
Lady Camden.

23:55.655 --> 23:58.620
Despite Lady looking like
the female gremlin up on stage,

23:58.689 --> 24:02.724
I think this is the most
attracted to her I've ever been.

24:02.793 --> 24:05.793
You know when you fantasize
about being Madonna?

24:05.862 --> 24:07.862
Everyone does it.
You're lying if you don't.

24:07.931 --> 24:10.413
To be in a music video
and to dance and lip sync,

24:10.482 --> 24:12.793
that is such a dream.

24:12.862 --> 24:14.896
This is so fun.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.862
Oh, my thighs
are on fucking fire.

24:18.931 --> 24:21.103
-Okay.
-All right, Angeria.

24:21.172 --> 24:23.241
I wanna see you walk
with conviction.

24:23.310 --> 24:25.517
-Walk like Naomi.
-Got it.

24:25.586 --> 24:28.827
I don't care if you have to get
down on your knees and crawl!

24:28.896 --> 24:30.724
-Okay.
-That was a hint.

24:30.793 --> 24:31.793
Let us have it.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.137
Michelle is hinting at Angeria

24:38.206 --> 24:40.931
that she should
get on her knees and crawl,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.448
but Angie doesn't take the note,
she doesn't get the hint.

24:45.931 --> 24:47.965
Come on, Betty.

24:48.034 --> 24:49.724
The minute I knew

24:49.793 --> 24:51.344
that Angie was not
gonna crawl on the catwalk

24:51.413 --> 24:52.931
and I was next to go,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.689
I'm like, "Move aside, bitch,
let me do it."

24:55.758 --> 24:57.517
Yeah!

24:57.586 --> 24:59.551
Daya gets on stage
and she crawls,

24:59.620 --> 25:02.344
and it is so funny
and I love it.

25:02.413 --> 25:06.137
It's just perfection. I wanna
see Daya crawl all the time.

25:09.068 --> 25:10.965
I love the crawl.

25:11.034 --> 25:12.344
It's almost as if
somebody recommended it.

25:12.413 --> 25:14.206
I'm in it to win it,

25:14.275 --> 25:17.275
and I let nothing get in my way
to this point,

25:17.344 --> 25:19.034
and you can sure as hell bet

25:19.103 --> 25:22.620
I'm not gonna let anything
get in my way to the crown.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.931
Coming up...

25:24.000 --> 25:27.413
What were your first
impressions of everyone?

25:27.482 --> 25:29.344
Miss Daya, when you walked in,

25:29.413 --> 25:30.724
I was just, like,
oh, I thought

25:30.793 --> 25:32.448
we had already figured out
who went home first.

25:32.517 --> 25:34.310
Today is the day

25:34.379 --> 25:38.724
that we find out who is
moving on to the grand finale.

25:52.241 --> 25:53.344
I'm gonna cry.

25:53.413 --> 25:54.896
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

25:54.965 --> 25:56.862
in the last day.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.413
We are going to look

25:58.482 --> 26:01.586
at our Catwalk
music video performances,

26:01.655 --> 26:03.689
and today is the day
that we find out

26:03.758 --> 26:07.551
who is moving on
to the grand finale.

26:08.620 --> 26:09.931
It feels really weird,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.206
knowing this is our last time
getting ready.

26:12.275 --> 26:13.724
I know.

26:13.793 --> 26:15.551
The last time we're gonna
get read by Michelle and Ru.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.724
-I know.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.862
I'm here at the end of the race,

26:19.931 --> 26:21.344
even though RuPaul
told me to go home,

26:21.413 --> 26:24.827
and then the chocolate bar
told RuPaul that I get to stay.

26:24.896 --> 26:27.896
I've learned you fall
and you get back up

26:27.965 --> 26:29.655
and you keep moving.

26:32.310 --> 26:35.655
What were your first
impressions of everyone?

26:35.724 --> 26:37.206
Start with me.

26:37.275 --> 26:41.482
I just remember feeling
so scared next to you.

26:41.551 --> 26:42.862
I was like, this bitch

26:42.931 --> 26:45.482
looks like she knows
exactly what she's doing.

26:45.551 --> 26:47.068
-When I came in,

26:47.137 --> 26:49.482
I was just, like, oh, she's
so pretty and seems so sweet.

26:49.551 --> 26:52.068
And then it wasn't
until you got out of drag

26:52.137 --> 26:54.241
that I was, like,
what the fuck?

26:54.310 --> 26:55.551
Who is this bitch?

26:55.620 --> 26:57.241
-Oh, my God.
-Because you were just, like,

26:57.310 --> 26:59.413
running around the werkroom,
like, aah!

27:01.241 --> 27:03.172
Willow, on the other hand,

27:03.241 --> 27:05.206
you were just kinda, like,
really, like, introverted

27:05.275 --> 27:07.137
and kind of just
working on your own thing.

27:07.206 --> 27:09.862
So I was like, I'm not
gonna, like, press myself.

27:09.931 --> 27:11.551
I'm gonna let it happen
naturally,

27:11.620 --> 27:14.827
and it did, because
you are literally, like,

27:14.896 --> 27:17.172
one of the closest people
to me here, so...

27:17.241 --> 27:18.551
-Aw!

27:18.620 --> 27:20.551
Everyone else I love,

27:20.620 --> 27:22.931
but I also view them
as competition.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.103
Angie's the one person

27:24.172 --> 27:25.931
that the love
we have with each other

27:26.000 --> 27:29.310
comes way beyond
anything competitive.

27:30.793 --> 27:31.965
Now, Miss Bosco.

27:32.034 --> 27:33.551
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.827
-Oh, wow.
-See, I walked in the werkroom

27:36.896 --> 27:38.275
after you guys
had all met each other,

27:38.344 --> 27:39.827
-because, you know--
-Mm-hmm.

27:39.896 --> 27:42.586
When you walked in,
I was just, like,

27:42.655 --> 27:45.551
oh, I thought we had already
figured out who went home first.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.172
I went home second
technically, okay?

27:47.241 --> 27:48.482
Technically, yes.

27:48.551 --> 27:50.310
Daya has the comeback story,

27:50.379 --> 27:53.275
'caused her ass was sent packing
on her first episode,

27:53.344 --> 27:54.896
and now
she is all the way here.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.827
She clawed her way
all the way up to the top

27:57.896 --> 28:01.310
off of talent
and pure hatred for Jasmine.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.137
Lady, I think
you were the person

28:04.206 --> 28:06.896
that I underestimated the most.

28:06.965 --> 28:08.862
I agree with Daya.

28:08.931 --> 28:11.896
Then when we were in
Daytona Wind,

28:11.965 --> 28:13.758
I was, like, what the fuck?

28:13.827 --> 28:15.241
Because it was just so good.

28:15.310 --> 28:16.689
Well, thanks, guys.
I'm glad that you all

28:16.758 --> 28:18.689
completely thought I was
terrible when I first got here.

28:20.379 --> 28:22.482
I'm not surprised by the other
queens' first impression of me.

28:22.551 --> 28:23.793
A lot of the other queens

28:23.862 --> 28:25.517
came in immediately showing
who they were,

28:25.586 --> 28:28.931
and I think it took some time
for me to...

28:29.000 --> 28:30.206
peek out.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.931
Just a friendly reminder.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.448
One of us in this room

28:33.517 --> 28:36.206
is gonna become the next
Drag Racesuperstar.

28:36.275 --> 28:37.965
-Yeah!

28:38.034 --> 28:39.241
Isn't that crazy?

28:39.310 --> 28:40.758
I want to win

28:40.827 --> 28:43.344
more than anything
in the world at this point,

28:43.413 --> 28:45.379
and I'm gonna do
everything it takes.

28:45.448 --> 28:48.344
I'm ready to strap myself in
and ride it.

28:48.413 --> 28:49.655
I'm gonna ride it.

28:49.724 --> 28:51.206
And I don't ride.
I never ride.

28:51.275 --> 28:53.137
That's not my gig.

28:53.206 --> 28:54.551
Someone is about
to make herstory.

28:54.620 --> 28:57.896
And win so much money.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.137
I know one thing, bitch.

28:59.206 --> 29:00.724
If it ain't me,
y'all ho's better share.

29:00.793 --> 29:03.413
Send me a check, girl!

29:03.482 --> 29:06.103
Check!

29:06.172 --> 29:07.413
I'm nervous because

29:07.482 --> 29:11.241
I just really want to be
in the finale so bad,

29:11.310 --> 29:13.482
and it's hard to know
what's gonna happen.

29:13.551 --> 29:14.724
But I feel good.

29:14.793 --> 29:16.965
I'm like, come on!

29:17.034 --> 29:19.413
So close.
Come on!

29:44.000 --> 29:46.137
Michelle:
Come on, Dolly Parton.

29:46.206 --> 29:48.862
Yes, dress of many colors!

29:48.931 --> 29:51.413
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

29:51.482 --> 29:54.241
She's perfect, she's beautiful,

29:54.310 --> 29:56.448
she looks like
Linda Evangelista.

29:56.517 --> 29:59.068
It's Michelle Visage.

29:59.137 --> 30:02.000
I think you mean
Gianna Evangelista,

30:02.068 --> 30:05.137
her mob wife cousin
from north Newark.

30:05.206 --> 30:07.172
No, I actually meant
Linda Lavin.

30:08.448 --> 30:10.344
Oh, my God, I'll take it!

30:10.413 --> 30:12.551
Style superstar Carson Kressley,

30:12.620 --> 30:14.655
any catwalk advice
for our girls?

30:14.724 --> 30:16.068
Yeah, shoulders back,
titties out,

30:16.137 --> 30:17.655
and don't piss off Naomi.

30:18.896 --> 30:21.448
And the hilarious Ross Mathews.

30:21.517 --> 30:24.896
Now, Ross, have you ever been
mistaken for a supermodel?

30:24.965 --> 30:26.896
Some people tell me I sort of
look like Cindy Crawford,

30:26.965 --> 30:28.655
but I don't really see it.

30:28.724 --> 30:30.034
Do you?

30:30.103 --> 30:34.275
Well, yes, I do see it.

30:34.344 --> 30:36.344
This week
we challenged our queens

30:36.413 --> 30:41.655
to live their supermodel fantasy
in the music video Catwalk.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.758
Racers, start your engines,

30:43.827 --> 30:46.965
and may the best drag queen win.

30:47.034 --> 30:49.310
Coming up...

30:49.379 --> 30:50.482
Wow!

30:50.551 --> 30:52.379
I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

30:52.448 --> 30:53.827
You got the job, kiddo.

30:53.896 --> 30:55.000
I think I've talked
too much, probably.

30:55.068 --> 30:57.413
-I suspect caffeine.

31:07.551 --> 31:10.137
Category is
You're A Winner, Baby.

31:10.206 --> 31:13.034
Up first, Bosco.

31:13.103 --> 31:14.965
Girl, you heard of
Breakfast at Tiffany's?

31:15.034 --> 31:17.275
This is Brunch at Tiffany's.

31:17.344 --> 31:19.310
It is the final runway,

31:19.379 --> 31:21.931
and you can't tell me shit.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.172
Oh, I look incredible.

31:25.241 --> 31:27.068
I'm channeling
a little bit of Marilyn,

31:27.137 --> 31:29.034
I'm giving you
a little bit of Madonna,

31:29.103 --> 31:32.586
but I'm also giving you
a whole lot of Bosco.

31:32.655 --> 31:34.862
I want the judges to take away

31:34.931 --> 31:37.137
that there's a lot
of versatility in my arsenal,

31:37.206 --> 31:39.206
and that I look good
in blonde hair.

31:39.275 --> 31:40.620
Carson:
Now, I've never seen one,

31:40.689 --> 31:43.137
but I think this is
what they call a glittoris.

31:45.655 --> 31:49.724
Angeria,
the Widow VanMicheals.

31:49.793 --> 31:51.689
No prenup.

31:51.758 --> 31:53.586
Baby,
I have worn stones

31:53.655 --> 31:55.758
and sequins
all season long, baby.

31:55.827 --> 31:57.620
But on this final runway,

31:57.689 --> 32:00.275
I don't need all that shine
to shine, honey.

32:00.344 --> 32:05.448
I am stunning as I am
in all black.

32:05.517 --> 32:08.241
She's giving you
a little asymmetrical moment

32:08.310 --> 32:10.586
so you can get into
the shoulder, honey.

32:10.655 --> 32:12.620
She's big, bold, and blonde.

32:12.689 --> 32:14.827
This is Angeria.
Take it or leave it, baby.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.206
This is who I am.

32:16.275 --> 32:19.586
I feel like a winner.

32:19.655 --> 32:21.758
And that was the night
the lights went out in Sparta!

32:25.793 --> 32:27.793
Daya Betty.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.517
Oh, it appears
her pussy was on fire,

32:30.586 --> 32:34.103
but they were able
to put it out.

32:34.172 --> 32:37.206
For my final time
walking down the runway,

32:37.275 --> 32:39.310
Daya Betty would not wear
a freaking princess gown.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.137
That is not who she is.

32:41.206 --> 32:44.172
So I wanted to use
this huge bustle

32:44.241 --> 32:47.758
on the most random spot
of my body,

32:47.827 --> 32:51.241
that is almost overwhelming to
look at, and then being burnt.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.206
I wanna portray the idea

32:53.275 --> 32:55.344
of tearing down
conventional beauty.

32:55.413 --> 32:58.689
I want the judges
to kind of look at me

32:58.758 --> 33:01.068
and be like, "What is she
doing, why is she wearing that,

33:01.137 --> 33:04.379
but how does it
somehow work for her?"

33:04.448 --> 33:06.482
Michelle:
I said "Carson," not "arson!"

33:08.965 --> 33:11.448
RuPaul:
Ooh, singe for the gods.

33:12.931 --> 33:14.931
Lady Camden.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.655
Ladies and gentlemen,
the daughter of Liberace.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.137
Tonight
I'm kind of embodying

33:23.206 --> 33:25.172
the Disney princesses
that I fell in love with

33:25.241 --> 33:27.344
when I was, like,
four or five years old.

33:27.413 --> 33:31.586
Little mini Rex would just
dream of looking like this.

33:31.655 --> 33:33.689
I'm wearing a headpiece
that my mum made for me,

33:33.758 --> 33:36.206
so it feels good to have
a little piece of her with me.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.724
I really just want
to show the judges

33:38.793 --> 33:42.344
Lady Camden can be pure glamour
and beauty and grace.

33:42.413 --> 33:44.172
Carson:
Hey, why the long ears?

33:44.241 --> 33:46.655
Michelle:
Oh, lobe, you betta don't.

33:50.379 --> 33:52.310
Willow Pill.

33:52.379 --> 33:54.172
Guess who's back in the mouse?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.862
Willow:
I am obsessed with rats.

33:58.931 --> 34:02.482
Rats are seen as
the sewer trash of America,

34:02.551 --> 34:04.137
but in my mind,

34:04.206 --> 34:08.620
there's something so cartoonish
and delicate about them.

34:08.689 --> 34:11.448
I feel like
I'm this rat princess.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.620
She's soft, she's elegant,

34:13.689 --> 34:15.758
and somehow connected
to the Mafia.

34:15.827 --> 34:17.206
I don't know how.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.206
Michelle:
Dare I say this look is cheesy?

34:20.586 --> 34:22.172
Carson:
But I'm all ears for it.

34:25.413 --> 34:26.965
Welcome, queens.

34:27.034 --> 34:28.965
It's time for
the global premiere

34:29.034 --> 34:32.172
of your music video, Catwalk.

37:18.827 --> 37:21.827
Wow!

37:21.896 --> 37:23.620
Nice job!

37:25.482 --> 37:26.586
Coming up...

37:26.655 --> 37:28.931
You have been
such a joy to watch.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.448
It was just all so good,
so fun, the camera loved you.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.103
You got the steps,

37:33.172 --> 37:34.931
but you missed some of
the lip sync that you wrote.

37:42.965 --> 37:47.103
Now let's find out
which of you kitty girls

37:47.172 --> 37:49.758
will be moving on
to the grand finale

37:49.827 --> 37:51.862
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

37:51.931 --> 37:53.275
It's time for
the judges' critiques,

37:53.344 --> 37:56.137
starting with Bosco.

37:56.206 --> 37:58.448
Let's talk about
this runway look first of all,

37:58.517 --> 38:01.310
because it is so gorgeous.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.413
I mean, the detail,
the stoning,

38:04.482 --> 38:06.551
the fleshy pink folds,

38:06.620 --> 38:09.034
-which I'm normally not into.

38:09.103 --> 38:12.206
It's all just so beautiful.

38:12.275 --> 38:13.517
I think the performance
in the video,

38:13.586 --> 38:15.068
it was a little tentative.

38:15.137 --> 38:16.827
We wanted to see face
and fierceness.

38:16.896 --> 38:19.000
I just wanted to kind of see

38:19.068 --> 38:20.241
more attitude
in the performance.

38:20.310 --> 38:22.241
I really loved you
in the music video.

38:22.310 --> 38:23.379
I loved your lyrics.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.137
I thought you had
such precision

38:25.206 --> 38:26.206
when you were dancing.

38:26.275 --> 38:28.413
Your outfit in the music video

38:28.482 --> 38:31.172
could have been a little edgier,
but it was you.

38:31.241 --> 38:34.620
It was corseted,
which is what you do so well.

38:34.689 --> 38:37.448
I also love that you had white
pumps, because as Ru says...

38:37.517 --> 38:40.310
White pumps are
the true sign of a whore.

38:40.379 --> 38:42.448
Yes, and around here, that's
how you dress like a winner.

38:44.241 --> 38:47.758
Your journey has been
an amazing one.

38:47.827 --> 38:49.724
You came into this
thinking that, yes,

38:49.793 --> 38:50.758
I'm the burlesque queen.

38:50.827 --> 38:52.103
This is what I do.

38:52.172 --> 38:55.620
But you won three
comedy-related challenges.

38:55.689 --> 38:59.206
Not one of them has to do
with what you thought you were,

38:59.275 --> 39:03.517
and there's something so
refreshing about you letting go

39:03.586 --> 39:05.620
and finding new things
out about yourself.

39:05.689 --> 39:08.103
I can't help
but bring up the fact

39:08.172 --> 39:09.482
that you almost weren't here.

39:09.551 --> 39:11.448
Oh, my goodness!

39:11.517 --> 39:13.068
And I can't get over that.

39:13.137 --> 39:14.275
You were sent home,

39:14.344 --> 39:15.862
and you were saved
by the drag gods.

39:15.931 --> 39:18.310
That's right, bitch, you got
a reprieve from the governor.

39:18.379 --> 39:20.379
Mm-hmm.

39:20.448 --> 39:25.206
I'm so glad that fate intervened
and brought you to this point.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.379
Thank you, thank you.

39:26.448 --> 39:30.068
Up next, Angeria Paris
VanMicheals.

39:30.137 --> 39:32.758
You have been
such a joy to watch,

39:32.827 --> 39:35.896
because every single week,
you brought great stuff.

39:35.965 --> 39:38.827
I think this look
is no exception.

39:38.896 --> 39:42.413
The silhouette, the proportions,
the accessories, perfection.

39:42.482 --> 39:44.551
It's like best little
funeral home in Texas,

39:44.620 --> 39:46.206
but in a great way.

39:46.275 --> 39:48.862
This is something
that I would wear, I adore.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.586
I think it's drag,
but it's also you.

39:51.655 --> 39:54.482
Your catwalk couture,
not my favorite.

39:54.551 --> 39:56.000
I don't even need
to go into details,

39:56.068 --> 39:57.448
because it's a bodysuit.

39:57.517 --> 40:00.862
And you were on the struggle bus
with the choreography.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.034
The issue is not
that you can't dance.

40:03.103 --> 40:06.034
The issue is
you freaked yourself out

40:06.103 --> 40:08.655
because there was a lot
thrown at you really quickly.

40:08.724 --> 40:10.931
What I see in the music video
is not what I think of

40:11.000 --> 40:14.275
when I think of Angeria
doing your level of drag.

40:14.344 --> 40:17.896
You are so good on stage.

40:17.965 --> 40:20.344
You have this ease about you,

40:20.413 --> 40:23.620
this charisma
that makes us root for you.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.413
Did you have fun?

40:25.482 --> 40:27.482
I did have fun.

40:27.551 --> 40:29.793
Within all the murky anxiety.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.758
Yeah. Yeah.

40:31.827 --> 40:33.655
I think for
as long as I can remember,

40:33.724 --> 40:36.862
I've always been very nervous
before doing things,

40:36.931 --> 40:40.241
and it feels really, really hard
to get out of it.

40:40.310 --> 40:41.344
I can tell you
how to get out of it.

40:41.413 --> 40:43.034
You have to just decide.

40:43.103 --> 40:44.172
Because we've all told you,

40:44.241 --> 40:46.034
you got it,
you got the job, kiddo.

40:46.103 --> 40:48.931
And once you get there,
you realize, huh.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.689
Can I do this
without the anxiety?

40:50.758 --> 40:53.172
That next level of stardom
that we're talking about

40:53.241 --> 40:56.275
is when you know
what you're gonna deliver,

40:56.344 --> 40:59.344
and you don't have to spend
all that time doing that.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.827
I think I've talked too much,
probably.

41:00.896 --> 41:02.482
I suspect caffeine.

41:02.551 --> 41:04.551
See? The investigation
continues.

41:04.620 --> 41:08.758
The investigation continues.

41:08.827 --> 41:10.034
Up next, Daya Betty.

41:10.103 --> 41:11.862
Let's talk about
this runway look right away,

41:11.931 --> 41:13.482
because I'm so excited by it.

41:13.551 --> 41:15.931
This is, like,
haute couture drag,

41:16.000 --> 41:16.931
and that's what it should be.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.068
I love the front bustle.

41:18.137 --> 41:20.379
I've never seen
one of those before.

41:20.448 --> 41:22.448
I love a gown
that conceals a boner.

41:24.103 --> 41:27.206
In the video,
the look was amazing.

41:27.275 --> 41:29.931
Bettie Page is one of
my all-time icons in my head.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.517
I've got her tattooed on my body
as well, so I understand.

41:32.586 --> 41:35.620
So when you came out, I was,
like, ee, very, very excited.

41:35.689 --> 41:37.068
Yeah, see, I like Betty White.

41:37.137 --> 41:38.482
I like Betty White, too,

41:38.551 --> 41:39.724
but she's not tattooed
on my--maybe that's next.

41:39.793 --> 41:42.034
What I loved about you

41:42.103 --> 41:44.793
is you gave it
your Daya Betty injection,

41:44.862 --> 41:46.206
I'm just gonna say it.

41:46.275 --> 41:49.172
Not an insulin reference,
but just an injection,

41:49.241 --> 41:51.448
and that's what it needed.

41:51.517 --> 41:52.862
You know, I had said to Angeria,

41:52.931 --> 41:54.620
"It would be really great
if you crawled,"

41:54.689 --> 41:56.241
and you came out
and you're like,

41:56.310 --> 41:57.896
"Oh, I heard that, bitch,"
and you crawled.

41:57.965 --> 41:59.689
Watching you
in that music video,

41:59.758 --> 42:02.482
damn, girl, you were selling it,

42:02.551 --> 42:04.793
and I couldn't
take my eyes off of you.

42:04.862 --> 42:06.896
You did come into
this competition,

42:06.965 --> 42:08.517
and we thought
of Crystal Methyd.

42:08.586 --> 42:10.551
But you have proven
you are no Crystal Lite.

42:10.620 --> 42:11.862
All right?

42:11.931 --> 42:14.068
This is when
you pick up the pace.

42:14.137 --> 42:15.448
This is when you take

42:15.517 --> 42:16.724
everything you've learned
in this competition

42:16.793 --> 42:19.620
and show us who you are
and what you can do.

42:19.689 --> 42:21.068
You did it.

42:21.137 --> 42:24.620
Up next, Lady Camden.

42:24.689 --> 42:26.862
This runway look, gorgeous.

42:26.931 --> 42:29.655
It's opulence, you know?
It's high drag.

42:29.724 --> 42:33.448
I love the headdress, I love
the over-the-top earrings.

42:33.517 --> 42:34.931
It's like you own
all of Antarctica,

42:35.000 --> 42:36.862
and we believe it.
It's stunning.

42:36.931 --> 42:38.344
In the video,
what you were wearing

42:38.413 --> 42:40.310
was so different
for Lady Camden,

42:40.379 --> 42:41.586
and I think that's amazing.

42:41.655 --> 42:43.724
Really fun
kind of Steampunk hair,

42:43.793 --> 42:45.724
and that hideous color.

42:45.793 --> 42:47.241
You did that to punish me.
I know you did.

42:47.310 --> 42:48.448
I did, yeah.

42:48.517 --> 42:49.724
You were--
and I'm going on record--

42:49.793 --> 42:52.137
the only one that got
every single move,

42:52.206 --> 42:55.206
every detail, every nuance
that Miguel wanted,

42:55.275 --> 42:57.965
and you did it with drag
and attitude. Dragitude.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.172
That's what we look for.

42:59.241 --> 43:00.862
You've been able to make

43:00.931 --> 43:03.896
all these iconic images
this season,

43:03.965 --> 43:07.103
and these performances
that are so unbelievable

43:07.172 --> 43:08.827
one after another.

43:08.896 --> 43:15.034
You have this power to bring
that extra bit of star quality

43:15.103 --> 43:18.448
to every single challenge,
and the thing I know about you,

43:18.517 --> 43:20.758
you know how good you are,
and it is a joy

43:20.827 --> 43:24.379
to see a performer
in their skin like you are.

43:24.448 --> 43:25.931
Thank you so much.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.724
All right, up next, Willow Pill.

43:28.793 --> 43:30.931
It's been really, really fun

43:31.000 --> 43:33.068
watching you compete
on so many different levels.

43:33.137 --> 43:34.931
The first time
we got to speak to you,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.103
you told us about
your battle with cystinosis.

43:37.172 --> 43:40.206
I've gone through kidney failure
and transplants.

43:40.275 --> 43:42.379
But what's
so inspirational to me

43:42.448 --> 43:44.482
is you never use it
as an excuse,

43:44.551 --> 43:47.068
and you've crushed it
in this competition.

43:47.137 --> 43:48.758
You've been amazing.

43:48.827 --> 43:51.758
Drag for you is just fun
and creative and kooky,

43:51.827 --> 43:55.137
and that is a great kind of
brand of drag to embrace,

43:55.206 --> 43:57.310
and I think you did that
the entire season.

43:57.379 --> 43:59.620
And even in your
catwalk couture, you know,

43:59.689 --> 44:01.689
it looks like a very simple
kind of, you know,

44:01.758 --> 44:03.517
like, miniskirt/bodice number,

44:03.586 --> 44:05.275
but to have
that profile silhouette

44:05.344 --> 44:07.034
of your face on the bodice,

44:07.103 --> 44:11.103
it's those smart, fun,
quirky things that make you you.

44:11.172 --> 44:13.793
Tonight on the runway,
that is really kooky.

44:15.517 --> 44:16.724
You've made a mouse drag,

44:16.793 --> 44:18.689
and it doesn't just
have to be a sexy mouse.

44:18.758 --> 44:20.965
It's a classy, beautiful mouse.

44:22.689 --> 44:25.586
I thought you were so cute
in the music video.

44:25.655 --> 44:27.275
You got the moves down.

44:27.344 --> 44:30.482
The problem was you weren't
selling it up here.

44:30.551 --> 44:32.931
We could see you counting.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.551
Because of that, you missed some
of the lip sync that you wrote.

44:39.413 --> 44:42.655
You are someone from my tribe.

44:42.724 --> 44:46.758
I know how hard it's been
for you, and yet here you are.

44:46.827 --> 44:48.448
So proud of you.

44:50.724 --> 44:52.172
Coming up...

44:52.241 --> 44:55.689
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

45:03.931 --> 45:08.551
Ladies, to share
your experience and hope

45:08.620 --> 45:09.896
with our younger viewers,

45:09.965 --> 45:13.137
it's time for me to ask, Bosco,

45:13.206 --> 45:18.034
what do you have to say
to your six-year-old self?

45:18.103 --> 45:19.827
Oh!

45:19.896 --> 45:22.724
You are gonna be
very uncomfortable

45:22.793 --> 45:24.758
for a very long time,

45:24.827 --> 45:26.689
and there's going to be
a lot of times

45:26.758 --> 45:30.413
where you feel like
apologizing for who you are.

45:30.482 --> 45:35.517
And I just want you to know,
do not be sorry, be fierce.

45:35.586 --> 45:37.586
Be louder, and one day,

45:37.655 --> 45:42.034
the things that...

45:42.103 --> 45:45.586
that people bring you down for
will be your power.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.103
And please give mom
another hug for me.

45:52.034 --> 45:55.551
You don't get as much time
as you'd like with her.

45:55.620 --> 45:56.931
Thank you.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.034
All right, Angeria.

45:59.103 --> 46:01.241
Oh!

46:01.310 --> 46:05.137
What do you have to say
to your four-year-old self?

46:05.206 --> 46:11.965
You are such a special,
beautiful, talented little boy,

46:12.034 --> 46:13.586
but you're gonna go to school,

46:13.655 --> 46:16.724
and the kids,
they're gonna tease you.

46:16.793 --> 46:18.517
Fuck them people.

46:18.586 --> 46:21.724
You have two amazing parents

46:21.793 --> 46:24.724
that are gonna be there for you
through everything.

46:24.793 --> 46:30.931
Your dad is one of
the best fathers in the world,

46:31.000 --> 46:35.517
and he's going to always
love you and be proud of you.

46:35.586 --> 46:37.000
Thank you.

46:37.068 --> 46:39.586
Up next, Daya Betty.

46:39.655 --> 46:44.413
What do you have to say
to your one-year-old self?

46:44.482 --> 46:48.000
You're gonna go through life
trying to fit in,

46:48.068 --> 46:50.275
like, trying to find
where you belong,

46:50.344 --> 46:53.896
and nothing will feel right.

46:55.275 --> 46:58.689
And then the moment
that you let your guard down

46:58.758 --> 47:02.517
and stop worrying about what
people are thinking about you

47:02.586 --> 47:05.896
is where you're really
gonna find your truest self.

47:05.965 --> 47:09.241
And you don't
have to worry so much

47:09.310 --> 47:10.896
about if your mom
is proud of you

47:10.965 --> 47:12.724
or if your dad is proud of you,

47:12.793 --> 47:15.068
because you're proud
of yourself.

47:15.137 --> 47:16.827
Thank you.

47:16.896 --> 47:21.413
Up next, Lady Camden.

47:21.482 --> 47:24.310
What do you have to say
to your four-year-old self?

47:24.379 --> 47:29.034
You're gonna start off
sweet and hopeful

47:29.103 --> 47:32.137
and just full of dreams,

47:32.206 --> 47:36.241
and people are gonna say
some mean shit to you.

47:36.310 --> 47:40.931
People are gonna make you feel
like you deserve that,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.482
and you don't.

47:42.551 --> 47:45.793
And some shit's gonna happen
to your family

47:45.862 --> 47:48.551
that is just...

47:48.620 --> 47:51.344
just so heavy and dark,

47:51.413 --> 47:56.551
but just please,
try not to harden up too much.

47:56.620 --> 47:57.724
Thank you.

47:57.793 --> 48:02.137
All right,
up next, Willow Pill.

48:02.206 --> 48:03.724
Mm.

48:03.793 --> 48:07.206
What do you have to say
to your three-year-old self?

48:07.275 --> 48:11.413
Oh, you have so much joy
and life in you,

48:11.482 --> 48:13.310
it's fucking insane.

48:13.379 --> 48:22.517
You're just gonna feel like life
takes everything away from you,

48:22.586 --> 48:28.137
and you're gonna have to
grieve people around you,

48:28.206 --> 48:30.000
and you're gonna
have to grieve yourself.

48:30.068 --> 48:37.310
But in stripping yourself
away from this Earth,

48:37.379 --> 48:40.034
you're gonna be
doing yourself a favor,

48:40.103 --> 48:43.827
because you'll just learn
to let go

48:43.896 --> 48:48.827
and have the queerness of
the universe shine through you.

48:50.620 --> 48:55.689
And I love you so much
until the end.

48:57.965 --> 48:59.241
Thank you.

49:02.689 --> 49:05.241
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

49:05.310 --> 49:07.517
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

49:07.586 --> 49:09.620
the judges and I
will deliberate.

49:09.689 --> 49:11.758
You may leave the stage.

49:13.586 --> 49:15.896
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

49:15.965 --> 49:17.068
whaddaya think?

49:17.137 --> 49:18.379
Now, this is a tough decision,

49:18.448 --> 49:20.827
because I love
each of these girls equally

49:20.896 --> 49:22.172
for different reasons.

49:22.241 --> 49:24.413
Let's start with Bosco.

49:24.482 --> 49:26.241
The biggest problem
I had with Bosco

49:26.310 --> 49:27.965
was what she was wearing.

49:28.034 --> 49:30.413
It was very Jet Blue after dark.

49:30.482 --> 49:32.034
But I think
she's a fabulous queen.

49:32.103 --> 49:34.827
Cerebral, beautiful, funny.

49:34.896 --> 49:36.517
I just wish
that in the music video

49:36.586 --> 49:38.862
she had put some more
of her heart into it.

49:38.931 --> 49:42.620
But the runway look tonight,
spectacular and very on-brand.

49:42.689 --> 49:47.517
She was giving us 1950s style
and sex symbol icon energy.

49:47.586 --> 49:49.206
Talk about a journey with Bosco.

49:49.275 --> 49:51.620
She's won three times,
she's been in the bottom twice,

49:51.689 --> 49:52.862
she almost went home.

49:52.931 --> 49:54.793
I mean, there's
more ups and downs

49:54.862 --> 49:56.724
than Michelle Visage
in a motel room.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.724
Hey!

49:57.793 --> 49:59.620
But I'll tell you this.

49:59.689 --> 50:01.620
There is no doubt
she should be standing here.

50:01.689 --> 50:03.517
All right,
let's move on to Angeria.

50:03.586 --> 50:05.896
Y'all, my heart
was breaking for her.

50:05.965 --> 50:08.827
She knew the opening move
and she knew the ending move,

50:08.896 --> 50:11.344
so I was trying to tell
her fake it till you make it.

50:11.413 --> 50:12.931
She spent a lot of the time
looking up.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.965
I couldn't understand
what she was going for,

50:15.034 --> 50:16.448
and she's, like, oh,
I'm going for Naomi Campbell.

50:16.517 --> 50:19.689
And I was like, okay, well,
then tell your face that,

50:19.758 --> 50:22.379
because it wasn't doing that.

50:22.448 --> 50:29.379
Once she doesn't have all of her
I's crossed and T's dotted...

50:29.448 --> 50:30.793
-That's the one.
-Yeah.

50:30.862 --> 50:32.655
...she kind of freaks out
a little bit.

50:32.724 --> 50:34.000
I think sometimes

50:34.068 --> 50:35.551
maybe that pageant perfection
gets in her way.

50:35.620 --> 50:37.000
But tonight on the runway,

50:37.068 --> 50:40.896
hallelujah,
praise the drag gods.

50:40.965 --> 50:42.241
That was gorgeous.

50:42.310 --> 50:44.275
You think, oh,
another pageant queen.

50:44.344 --> 50:45.827
I've seen this. Uh-uh.

50:45.896 --> 50:48.206
The way Angeria does it,
you've seen nothin' yet.

50:48.275 --> 50:50.241
All right, let's move on
to Daya Betty.

50:50.310 --> 50:53.206
She pulled a Vanessa Williams
and saved the best for last.

50:53.275 --> 50:56.689
That Catwalkmusic video
look was so great.

50:56.758 --> 50:58.896
It was Bettie Page 2.0.

50:58.965 --> 51:01.931
She has great taste,
and it was executed beautifully.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.896
And her conviction to
the choreography was amazing.

51:06.965 --> 51:10.896
She was present, she looked
at the camera, she sold it.

51:10.965 --> 51:12.724
Tonight on the runway,

51:12.793 --> 51:15.586
I was living for this
Galliano-inspired,

51:15.655 --> 51:17.827
weird, makes-no-sense look.

51:17.896 --> 51:19.862
It was just sublime.

51:19.931 --> 51:22.172
Daya was almost gone right away.
-Yeah.

51:22.241 --> 51:26.310
And she has fought her way
back to the top five?

51:26.379 --> 51:27.896
-That is so commendable.
-Yep.

51:27.965 --> 51:29.482
All right, let's move on
to Lady Camden.

51:29.551 --> 51:31.344
In the music video,
I thought she was amazing.

51:31.413 --> 51:35.137
I mean, she is truly
a very, very gifted dancer,

51:35.206 --> 51:37.448
and she did more
than the choreography.

51:37.517 --> 51:38.965
She became a supermodel.

51:39.034 --> 51:41.034
She looked at us
through that camera,

51:41.103 --> 51:43.275
and she just fucked us.

51:43.344 --> 51:45.517
-Mm-hmm.
-And I was begging for more.

51:45.586 --> 51:48.482
I do feel a little burning
down there still.

51:48.551 --> 51:50.896
It was a joy to watch her.

51:50.965 --> 51:55.965
She was so easy with her
movement and her narrative,

51:56.034 --> 51:57.413
which was so clear.

51:57.482 --> 52:00.068
All in all, she started out
rough for me--

52:00.137 --> 52:01.931
I'm not gonna lie--
in this competition.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.310
And I thought, oh,
this drag is very, very basic.

52:05.379 --> 52:08.655
She just went up
instead of flatlined,

52:08.724 --> 52:12.241
and tonight, absolutely
breathtakingly beautiful.

52:12.310 --> 52:14.241
All right, let's move on down
to Willow Pill.

52:14.310 --> 52:17.344
What I love about her is that
she's very, very fearless,

52:17.413 --> 52:19.655
and I think that comes
from having to face things

52:19.724 --> 52:22.379
that are a lot scarier than,
like, fucking up a drag routine.

52:22.448 --> 52:25.517
Yeah. I mean,
from the day she got here,

52:25.586 --> 52:28.241
with those
marshmallow flip-flops,

52:28.310 --> 52:30.448
I love Willow Pill.

52:30.517 --> 52:32.965
Tonight on the runway,
oh, my goodness,

52:33.034 --> 52:34.965
like, I love this so much.

52:35.034 --> 52:36.413
It made me so happy.

52:36.482 --> 52:39.000
It's, like,
Mary's best friend Rodent.

52:39.068 --> 52:40.517
-Oh, my God.

52:40.586 --> 52:43.758
I don't really get it,
but it was executed well.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.689
What don't you get?
She's a mouse!

52:45.758 --> 52:47.000
I get that she's a mouse.

52:47.068 --> 52:48.206
I just--I don't know
why she's a mouse.

52:48.275 --> 52:49.482
Oh.

52:49.551 --> 52:50.689
I don't know why
she's a mouse either,

52:50.758 --> 52:52.068
but I don't give a shit.

52:53.448 --> 52:55.379
I think it's fun,
and it's so unexpected,

52:55.448 --> 52:57.448
and, you know,
the "why" with Willow,

52:57.517 --> 52:59.482
it's like, I don't even ask
at this point, you know.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.862
Why did she
introduce herself to us

53:01.931 --> 53:04.068
by pouring spaghetti
into a bathtub?

53:04.137 --> 53:06.793
I don't know,
but I'm here for it,

53:06.862 --> 53:09.137
because she's got
something to say.

53:09.206 --> 53:11.793
The music video,
not her best performance.

53:11.862 --> 53:13.310
She kind of faded away
a little bit,

53:13.379 --> 53:16.068
and there were
two or three superstars.

53:16.137 --> 53:18.275
It's hard to stand up
against that competition.

53:18.344 --> 53:21.931
It just--probably thinking
too much got the best of her,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.586
and she didn't really project

53:23.655 --> 53:26.344
or connect with that camera,
unfortunately.

53:26.413 --> 53:28.344
Ru, this is a tough one.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.551
I feel like any of these queens

53:29.620 --> 53:30.620
could win
this whole competition.

53:30.689 --> 53:32.586
-Totally.
-They are so good,

53:32.655 --> 53:34.103
and it's neck and neck.

53:34.172 --> 53:36.137
All right, silence.

53:37.724 --> 53:39.310
I've made my decision.

53:39.379 --> 53:41.379
Bring back my girls.

53:46.793 --> 53:48.931
Welcome back, ladies.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.344
You all did
an amazing job this week

53:52.413 --> 53:54.793
and all season long.

53:54.862 --> 53:57.448
Thank you all
for being gracious enough

53:57.517 --> 53:59.448
to share your stories with us,

53:59.517 --> 54:02.482
your vulnerabilities,
your tears, your laughter,

54:02.551 --> 54:04.724
your power, your creativity.

54:04.793 --> 54:06.551
Thank you.

54:06.620 --> 54:09.413
Now, I've made some decisions.

54:17.275 --> 54:18.413
Daya Betty.

54:18.482 --> 54:22.241
In the video
and on the runway,

54:22.310 --> 54:24.413
your pussy was on fire.

54:25.551 --> 54:28.862
Cinderfella, you are safe.

54:28.931 --> 54:30.000
Oh, my God!

54:30.068 --> 54:31.517
Con-drag-ulations.

54:31.586 --> 54:34.310
You're moving forward
to the grand finale.

54:34.379 --> 54:37.655
Thank you guys so much.

54:37.724 --> 54:39.827
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

54:39.896 --> 54:41.310
You may step
to the back of the stage.

54:41.379 --> 54:46.068
Oh, my freaking goodness,
I made it to the finale.

54:46.137 --> 54:48.793
This is freaking insane to me.

54:53.517 --> 54:57.448
Lady Camden. This week, you
catwalked your way to the top.

54:57.517 --> 54:59.034
Con-drag-ulations.

54:59.103 --> 55:01.275
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

55:01.344 --> 55:03.034
Oh, my God!

55:03.103 --> 55:06.965
I won the fucking
last fucking maxi-challenge!

55:07.034 --> 55:10.827
What?

55:10.896 --> 55:13.724
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000,

55:13.793 --> 55:17.000
and you are moving forward
to the grand finale.

55:20.172 --> 55:24.241
This is absolutely
my dream come true.

55:24.310 --> 55:28.275
Thank you all so much
from the heart of my bottom.

55:37.793 --> 55:40.068
Bosco. On the runway,

55:40.137 --> 55:44.103
you served Diamonds
are a Girl's Best Friend,

55:44.172 --> 55:48.793
but in the music video,
we wanted more sparkle.

55:51.275 --> 55:53.655
Angeria. On the runway,

55:53.724 --> 55:56.931
you proved
that Black is beautiful,

55:57.000 --> 56:01.689
but your supermodel
seemed super nervous.

56:03.655 --> 56:05.965
Willow. On the runway,

56:06.034 --> 56:08.172
you were the mouse that roared,

56:08.241 --> 56:12.758
but in the music video,
you looked a little trapped.

56:22.137 --> 56:25.965
Bosco, you are safe.

56:30.310 --> 56:31.586
Con-drag-ulations.

56:31.655 --> 56:34.413
You are moving forward
to the grand finale.

56:36.793 --> 56:37.724
Thank you.

56:37.793 --> 56:41.137
My brain shuts off

56:41.206 --> 56:43.551
after I find out
I'm in the top three.

56:43.620 --> 56:46.965
I am so, so excited.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.620
Angeria and Willow Pill,

56:54.689 --> 56:58.206
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

56:58.275 --> 57:01.551
This is not the mood right now.

57:01.620 --> 57:04.379
And I'm gonna do
what I need to do to stay here,

57:04.448 --> 57:06.344
but to know that one of us

57:06.413 --> 57:08.724
would be in the finale
without the other one

57:08.793 --> 57:11.448
is just, like, fucked.

57:11.517 --> 57:15.172
Two queens stand before me.

57:15.241 --> 57:21.758
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:21.827 --> 57:25.241
and save yourselves
from elimination.

57:26.965 --> 57:30.137
I'm heartbroken
that it's me and Angeria,

57:30.206 --> 57:32.586
but I'm not gonna hold back
in this lip sync.

57:32.655 --> 57:34.689
That would not be true
to who I am,

57:34.758 --> 57:38.896
and that would not be true
to me and Angie's friendship.

57:38.965 --> 57:40.896
The time has come...

57:40.965 --> 57:44.793
for you to lip sync...

57:44.862 --> 57:48.448
for your life!

57:52.586 --> 57:57.448
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

58:30.620 --> 58:31.931
If there are things

58:32.000 --> 58:34.758
that are considered holy
in the gay culture,

58:34.827 --> 58:36.275
this song is one of them.

58:36.344 --> 58:38.275
They cannot screw this up,

58:38.344 --> 58:39.724
otherwise they're
both going home.

59:10.827 --> 59:12.862
♪ Stop callin', stop callin',

59:29.137 --> 59:32.310
Baby, me and Willow
are dancing together

59:32.379 --> 59:33.448
like we are up
in the club, honey,

59:33.517 --> 59:34.724
feeling our oats,

59:34.793 --> 59:38.551
and honestly,
I am sharing the spotlight

59:38.620 --> 59:41.517
with the person I am closest to
in this competition,

59:41.586 --> 59:43.206
and it feels amazing.

1:00:04.758 --> 1:00:05.965
Carson:
She danced her ears off.

1:00:06.034 --> 1:00:08.344
-Yes, girls!

1:00:10.103 --> 1:00:12.344
Ladies, I've made my decision.

1:00:20.137 --> 1:00:21.241
Angeria.

1:00:22.655 --> 1:00:23.862
Shantay you stay.

1:00:28.551 --> 1:00:29.793
Con-drag-ulations.

1:00:29.862 --> 1:00:32.000
You'll be moving on
to the grand finale.

1:00:34.862 --> 1:00:35.793
Willow Pill.

1:00:35.862 --> 1:00:37.275
My dear...

1:00:38.482 --> 1:00:40.068
Shantay you stay.

1:00:40.137 --> 1:00:41.172
Oh!

1:00:41.241 --> 1:00:42.586
Con-drag-ulations.

1:00:42.655 --> 1:00:46.551
You will also be moving forward
to the grand finale.

1:00:47.586 --> 1:00:49.793
Bitch, what?

1:00:51.724 --> 1:00:54.758
This is the kind of ending
that I wanted.

1:00:56.931 --> 1:00:58.931
I am so happy.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.241
This is what I wanted:

1:01:00.310 --> 1:01:02.379
the two of us to make it
all the way together.

1:01:02.448 --> 1:01:04.931
I wouldn't imagine it
any other way.

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.896
We have a top five, damn it.

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:13.344
Gold bars for everyone!

1:01:14.689 --> 1:01:17.724
Our season has been
a season of firsts.

1:01:17.793 --> 1:01:20.310
We shitty'd Snatch Game,
aLalaparuza.

1:01:20.379 --> 1:01:22.000
A top five?

1:01:22.068 --> 1:01:24.310
I can't wait to see
what twists and turns

1:01:24.379 --> 1:01:26.827
we're gonna have to do
to come out on top,

1:01:26.896 --> 1:01:31.241
but top five with these girls,
anything is possible.

1:01:31.310 --> 1:01:33.517
Now I wanna hear from you,
the viewers.

1:01:33.586 --> 1:01:37.517
Who do you want to be
America's next drag superstar?

1:01:37.586 --> 1:01:40.034
Are you Team Angeria,

1:01:40.103 --> 1:01:42.551
Team Bosco,

1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:45.275
Team Daya Betty,

1:01:45.344 --> 1:01:47.000
Team Lady Camden,

1:01:47.068 --> 1:01:49.551
or Team Willow Pill?

1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:53.793
Let your voice be heard
using #DragRace.

1:01:53.862 --> 1:01:57.413
And tune in next week for
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited,

1:01:57.482 --> 1:01:59.413
and join us in two weeks

1:01:59.482 --> 1:02:03.137
for a grand finale
of RuPaul's Drag Race,

1:02:03.206 --> 1:02:05.586
where we are going to do what?

1:02:05.655 --> 1:02:08.172
Crown ourselves a winner, baby.

1:02:10.206 --> 1:02:11.689
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:02:11.758 --> 1:02:14.206
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:02:14.275 --> 1:02:16.724
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:02:16.793 --> 1:02:17.931
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.034
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:02:19.103 --> 1:02:21.517
All right.
Now let the music play.
