33:19.765 --> 33:22.069
I...

33:22.069 --> 33:24.607
I'd love you to be part of it.

33:40.773 --> 33:42.611
Why didn't you tell me?

33:42.611 --> 33:44.413
I wanted the surprise
to be real.

33:44.413 --> 33:47.486
- We don't spy on our own.
- Sometimes we have to.

33:47.486 --> 33:49.290
This is one of those times?

33:49.290 --> 33:50.827
Hour's work
could fundamentally change

33:50.827 --> 33:52.831
the way the Bureau operates.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.768
Tell me this isn't because
her parents are from Iran.

33:54.768 --> 33:56.772
No, come on, Poet.
It had nothing to do with that.

33:56.772 --> 33:59.210
If you have concerns,
talk to her.

33:59.210 --> 34:01.247
This is bigger
than friendships, okay?

34:01.247 --> 34:02.784
We need someone on the inside
of her operation.

34:02.784 --> 34:04.386
It's not gonna be me.

34:05.422 --> 34:07.359
Then we'll find someone else.

34:08.128 --> 34:10.800
- Wouldn't you rather it be you?
- (laughs)

34:10.800 --> 34:13.371
Sometimes I forget
why we broke up,

34:13.371 --> 34:15.643
but you always
fucking remind me.

34:21.220 --> 34:23.257
(knocking at door)

34:29.436 --> 34:31.240
- (door opens)
- POET: Hey.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.813
Am I... am I disturbing
your work?

34:33.813 --> 34:35.850
Not at all.

34:35.850 --> 34:38.254
LENNIX: I had an idea
I wanted to run past you.

34:38.254 --> 34:40.526
- POET: Sure. Go for it.
- You know Evans's wife

34:40.526 --> 34:42.396
is staying at the motel
in Triangle?

34:42.396 --> 34:44.701
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
you mentioned it.

34:44.701 --> 34:47.172
He's going back and forth
from the base to the motel.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.876
He's not hanging out with us
as much as he'd like,

34:48.876 --> 34:51.582
so, I thought maybe we could

34:51.582 --> 34:53.719
all have a meal together
this weekend?

34:53.719 --> 34:55.623
POET:
Yeah, in-in Triangle?

34:55.623 --> 34:57.594
There's a Mexican restaurant,

34:57.594 --> 34:59.463
quesos,
two and half stars on Yelp.

34:59.463 --> 35:01.200
(gasps)
Wow.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.873
I think it's a good idea, too.

35:03.873 --> 35:07.179
Great. I'll, uh...
I'll make the reservation.

35:07.179 --> 35:08.683
Can you talk to Tayo?

35:08.683 --> 35:10.553
Yeah. I don't know
if he'll come, but I'll try.

35:10.553 --> 35:13.626
- Okay. See ya.
- All right.

35:13.626 --> 35:16.531
(door closes)

35:20.940 --> 35:23.879
Nothing is gonna happen.

35:23.879 --> 35:26.150
It's already happening.

35:28.287 --> 35:30.760
(upbeat song playing
in Spanish)

35:30.760 --> 35:33.866
POET:
So was your family disappointed

35:33.866 --> 35:35.636
you didn't become a lawyer?

35:35.636 --> 35:37.607
No. No, they, uh...

35:37.607 --> 35:39.310
- WAITRESS: Here you go.
- Thanks.

35:39.310 --> 35:41.381
My, uh, parents figured
with a little bit of...

35:41.381 --> 35:43.485
public service under my belt,

35:43.485 --> 35:45.322
they could line me up
to run for senator.

35:45.322 --> 35:47.493
Wow. Is that really
how it works?

35:47.493 --> 35:49.898
Yeah. Right now,
my parents are doing the math

35:49.898 --> 35:51.535
on how many extra votes I'll get

35:51.535 --> 35:53.238
if I take a bullet
in the line of fire.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.875
(laughing):
Oh, my gosh.

35:54.875 --> 35:56.812
Yeah. How about you?

35:56.812 --> 36:00.753
Um, I... I never met my dad.

36:00.753 --> 36:02.791
Though I'm told
he was a really nice guy,

36:02.791 --> 36:04.493
right until the day
that he left.

36:04.493 --> 36:06.631
Did you ever try to find him?

36:07.432 --> 36:10.640
No. No, he's not a mystery
that I'm...

36:10.640 --> 36:12.242
that I'm interested in solving.

36:12.242 --> 36:13.679
- Oh.
- Mm-mm.

36:13.679 --> 36:15.650
No, my mom raised me
on her own.

36:15.650 --> 36:19.423
You know, she was kind of
my mom, my dad, my best friend.

36:19.423 --> 36:21.494
Hmm.

36:21.494 --> 36:23.364
Well, she must be very proud
of you.

36:23.364 --> 36:25.903
Yeah, she was. She passed.

36:25.903 --> 36:27.640
I'm sorry.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.276
I was 18. I was...

36:29.276 --> 36:31.447
I was out of the house,
I was in college.

36:31.447 --> 36:35.790
Um... she had
a nervous breakdown.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.727
It was...

36:37.727 --> 36:39.831
It was almost like she was...

36:39.831 --> 36:42.436
carrying me on her back.

36:42.436 --> 36:44.941
And when she, you know,
got me over the finish line,

36:44.941 --> 36:46.812
- she collapsed.
- Hmm.

36:46.812 --> 36:48.849
She was in and out of hospitals
until the end,

36:48.849 --> 36:52.524
and... I think it's why
I became a nurse.

36:52.524 --> 36:55.262
Like, to pay back the debt
that I owed her.

36:55.262 --> 36:57.834
But?

36:57.834 --> 37:01.542
I just never felt close to her,

37:01.542 --> 37:03.712
you know, in those hospitals.

37:03.712 --> 37:06.450
And when that agent
just showed up out of nowhere

37:06.450 --> 37:08.989
and asked me if I wanted
to join the FBI,

37:08.989 --> 37:11.260
I, uh...

37:13.331 --> 37:15.837
Like, I don't know. It felt like
she was talking to me.

37:15.837 --> 37:18.676
Like, um...

37:18.676 --> 37:22.683
she was telling me she didn't
want me in the hospital.

37:25.388 --> 37:27.660
Oh, my God.
I sound so mystical, don't I?

37:29.731 --> 37:31.701
No.

37:37.747 --> 37:41.988
Poet and Lennix are going
to be married within five years.

37:43.024 --> 37:46.029
- Poet and Lennix?
- Mm-hmm.

37:49.637 --> 37:51.007
Okay, I'll take that bet.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.644
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, you are crazy.

37:52.644 --> 37:54.981
- Oh, yeah, I'll take it.
- It's inevitable.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.887
Yeah, but Poet is too busy
looking after everybody else

37:57.887 --> 37:59.891
to be looking
after herself, so...

37:59.891 --> 38:01.494
(inhales)

38:01.494 --> 38:04.734
Yeah. You may be right.

38:04.734 --> 38:07.039
I am. I am definitely right
about that.

38:07.039 --> 38:09.342
(chuckles)

38:11.548 --> 38:13.519
What about you?

38:13.519 --> 38:15.656
- Hmm.
- You got your eye on anybody?

38:15.656 --> 38:18.829
- No.
- No one?

38:18.829 --> 38:20.899
No one.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.651
What about you?

38:29.651 --> 38:31.955
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm-I'm...
I'm never getting married.

38:31.955 --> 38:34.059
- What are you talking about?
- It's never gonna happen,

38:34.059 --> 38:36.397
and I-I've made peace with it
a long time ago.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.934
- It's just not...
- Okay.

38:37.934 --> 38:39.671
The people who say
they're never gonna get married

38:39.671 --> 38:41.642
are always the first
to be swept off their feet.

38:41.642 --> 38:43.077
Oh, my God. It's...
That's not me.

38:43.077 --> 38:45.549
- I'm not...
- I guarantee it.

38:46.818 --> 38:48.121
- (Tayo mutters)
- EVANS: Um, hey, everybody,

38:48.121 --> 38:50.993
um, thanks
for coming tonight.

38:50.993 --> 38:53.565
Lennix for putting this
all together.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.101
- (whoops)
- Um,

38:55.101 --> 38:58.842
I'm not really one
for, uh, speeches, obviously.

38:58.842 --> 39:00.846
Um, so a toast to Class of '09.

39:00.846 --> 39:02.951
ALL: Class of '09.

39:02.951 --> 39:04.721
- Cheers.
- (overlapping whooping, chatter)

39:04.721 --> 39:06.424
(glasses clinking,
overlapping chatter)

39:06.424 --> 39:08.528
Cheers.

39:10.899 --> 39:12.937
Why do you have your car here?

39:12.937 --> 39:16.845
Uh, because I drove to Quantico.

39:16.845 --> 39:18.983
Oh.

39:18.983 --> 39:21.120
From California.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.692
Yeah, the whole way.

39:23.692 --> 39:26.097
You, uh, didn't want
to be seen arriving

39:26.097 --> 39:27.967
- on an airport minibus? (laughs)
- (laughs)

39:27.967 --> 39:30.673
No.

39:30.673 --> 39:32.710
Not enough romance to it, huh?

39:32.710 --> 39:34.547
There's no romance to it.

39:34.547 --> 39:36.718
- Hey, I got the chariot, okay?
- Thank you.

39:36.718 --> 39:38.154
- You're welcome. Yeah.
- Do you want to sit...?
- You know, uh,

39:38.154 --> 39:39.758
actually, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna ride with them.

39:39.758 --> 39:41.494
- What are you doing?
- It's a tight space...

39:41.494 --> 39:42.964
Hey, there is...
there is no space

39:42.964 --> 39:45.035
- in that car for you, okay?
- No. Come.

39:45.035 --> 39:46.838
Go. (laughs)

The Senate Judiciary Committee
will come to order.

41:43.839 --> 41:45.576
Director Michaels,

41:45.576 --> 41:47.847
you're nearing the end
of your ten years

41:47.847 --> 41:50.586
as director of the FBI.

41:50.586 --> 41:52.590
The question for this hearing

41:52.590 --> 41:55.796
is whether it's right
to extend your term.

41:55.796 --> 42:00.038
I've overseen one
of the most radical changes

42:00.038 --> 42:02.209
to the way
that the Bureau operates.

42:02.209 --> 42:05.014
I've integrated
groundbreaking technology

42:05.014 --> 42:07.352
into our investigative process.

42:07.352 --> 42:10.893
Artificial intelligence
that misses nothing

42:10.893 --> 42:13.064
and judges everyone as equals.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.801
And as a consequence,

42:14.801 --> 42:16.938
we have all enjoyed one
of the steepest periods

42:16.938 --> 42:20.912
of criminal decline
that this country has ever seen.

42:22.348 --> 42:24.888
We can now say
that not only are we one

42:24.888 --> 42:27.058
of the greatest nations
on Earth,

42:27.058 --> 42:29.831
we are also one of the safest.

42:29.831 --> 42:33.772
SPENSER: Director,
if the system is so great,

42:33.772 --> 42:36.645
why do you need five more years?

42:36.645 --> 42:38.916
TAYO: Progress...

42:38.916 --> 42:42.188
is like a child, isn't it?

42:43.725 --> 42:45.996
You must protect it.

42:45.996 --> 42:50.004
You must...
keep your arms around it.

42:51.340 --> 42:53.645
And that's why I'm here.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.050
Good to see you, Poet.

42:56.050 --> 42:57.653
It's good to see you, too.

42:57.653 --> 43:00.191
What brings you here?

43:00.191 --> 43:02.730
I was sent
to arrest Amos Garcia

43:02.730 --> 43:04.801
without any idea why.

43:04.801 --> 43:07.071
Wasn't working on his case.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.411
And then I found out
that you had requested it?

43:10.411 --> 43:13.284
That's true. I sent you there.
You and Murphy.

43:13.284 --> 43:15.288
Why?

43:15.288 --> 43:19.429
Amos... is unwell.

43:19.429 --> 43:21.233
Mentally, physically.

43:21.233 --> 43:25.074
He has become
a very dangerous man.

43:25.074 --> 43:28.982
He has ideas on you,
and he has ideas on me.

43:30.986 --> 43:33.024
Where is he now?

43:33.024 --> 43:35.327
That's the thing.
We don't know.

43:37.766 --> 43:39.803
Am I being followed?

43:41.006 --> 43:43.745

You were in my home.

I know where your career began.
I know where it ended up.
