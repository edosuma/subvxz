<i> Martin </ i></i>

02:29.024 --> 02:31.015
We <i> and touches us. </ i></i>

02:39.668 --> 02:42.637
How come you fell asleep so fast?

02:45.474 --> 02:49.001
Ambition, a good diet, concentration,
good communication.

02:49.078 --> 02:51.012
Got a new support?

02:51.380 --> 02:53.415
I heard that is part of the family and used
be his.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.315
Well, in that case ...

02:58.287 --> 03:00.346
As I like.

03:02.258 --> 03:04.860
Are you going to that thing for the new
residence?

03:04.861 --> 03:06.851
I do not know.

03:09.365 --> 03:11.629
- Carson's daughter will be there.
- Who is Carson?

03:11.734 --> 03:15.135
Cardiology. It is the best in that
specialty.

03:15.237 --> 03:19.108
Mark's time we start
looking for that trophy wife.

03:20.259 --> 03:21.076
Bring it back!

03:21.077 --> 03:26.537
<i> Dr. Leary, 4152.
Doctor Leary, 4152. </ I></i>

03:32.621 --> 03:34.782
As it is, sir ...

03:35.557 --> 03:37.616
- Sanchez?
- I do not speak English.

03:39.862 --> 03:43.923
- Do not speak Spanish.
- Doctor, mind you.

03:43.999 --> 03:46.160
I s ent b in here
in my chest.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.930
I have a lot of pain,
much, much pain here.

03:49.004 --> 03:53.100
- I need medicine, I feel good.
- Please wait for me a moment.

03:53.175 --> 03:58.636
- Please, Doctor!
- Doctor Pange, do you speak Spanish?

03:59.648 --> 04:01.275
No.

04:03.252 --> 04:05.152
Can you cough?.

04:07.890 --> 04:09.187
Right.

04:15.764 --> 04:18.164
Ok, you need descanzar enough.

04:18.267 --> 04:22.601
- Rest. Sleep. Resting.
- Rest.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.969
So, is that you need ok?

04:25.040 --> 04:29.170
The results are negative.
What proposals are for this case?

04:29.278 --> 04:31.644
I thought we should discard it.

04:31.747 --> 04:35.342
Ell has the syndrome are
and is likely to have a slow death.

04:35.451 --> 04:38.887
So, is something that can be a pain
chronic.

04:44.927 --> 04:48.954
- What are you talking about a divorce?.
- Did you talk to her?

04:49.765 --> 04:53.360
- No, not on things like that.
- We are talking about a syndrome.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.403
Communication is the key to everything.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.769
- Blake!
- Yes?

05:02.425 --> 05:04.987
- Blake, things are going well?
- Yes

05:05.347 --> 05:08.544
I was wondering, the infection is
exposed to the disease?

05:08.650 --> 05:11.676
- Yes
- Okay so I wanted to say.

05:11.787 --> 05:13.186
Do you have any advice?

05:13.255 --> 05:17.306
Missing 6 days for the residence, you can not
apply until next year.

05:18.015 --> 05:20.026
I just want to be prepared.

05:20.725 --> 05:22.789
Oh well not much to do.

05:22.898 --> 05:25.765
A great candidate is simply
a good doctor.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.597
Clear.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.672
That means you're a good doctor.
Is not Martin?

05:31.640 --> 05:34.074
It acts like one.

05:34.176 --> 05:38.892
- I do, I do.
- Well then you're fine.

05:38.893 --> 05:41.109
- Doctor Waylans!
- Yes, Martin?

05:41.550 --> 05:44.110
Can I re-take the
photo identification?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.449
I have no idea!

05:48.190 --> 05:52.422
- Excuse me, what does it say here?
- Penicillin.

06:02.271 --> 06:04.262
Excuse me, when will the doctor?

06:04.373 --> 06:05.806
I am the doctor.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.604
Ok, that's all for now.

06:10.332 --> 06:13.107
¿Nurse, doing this procedure?

06:13.108 --> 06:16.170
You'll have to do it yourself.
Do you know how to do it?

06:16.418 --> 06:18.818
Yeah, thanks.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.966
Is that right?

06:34.069 --> 06:36.902
Sorry, we assume that a nurse
do this type of thing.

06:36.972 --> 06:39.805
- A what?
- This will drain some blood.

06:39.908 --> 06:42.604
Doctors do not do this.

06:53.322 --> 06:55.187
Very good.

06:55.924 --> 06:57.824
Ok.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.892
There you are!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.862
I'm so sorry, I thought
you were someone else!

08:09.965 --> 08:12.456
Who thought it was?

08:12.501 --> 08:14.992
I already knew.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.070
So, for a minute
I thought it was you!

08:18.071 --> 08:19.771
There is only one, that's my rule.

08:19.772 --> 08:22.134
He is Martin,
She is Christine Martin.

08:22.277 --> 08:24.711
- Hello.
- She is the daughter of Dr. Carson.

08:29.154 --> 08:31.431
Well, again you were a nerd
Total high school.

08:31.432 --> 08:32.183
That's right!

08:32.183 --> 08:33.316
- Really?
- Yes!

08:33.724 --> 08:36.433
One day I realized that he would die
virgin.

09:41.390 --> 09:44.127
With a couple of Mexicans
we can make it all happen.

09:44.162 --> 09:48.961
- Make it happen, why?
- What if you're just something useful?

09:49.698 --> 09:51.632
Jimmy, come on.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.863
Good morning, Doctor.

10:00.442 --> 10:02.137
Hey.

10:02.244 --> 10:04.769
- How do you feel?
- Mal

10:05.714 --> 10:08.512
What do I have?

10:08.617 --> 10:12.519
Pilonefritis, is a disease
in the kidney.

10:15.123 --> 10:20.584
Pilonefritis.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.528
Like this?

10:28.036 --> 10:30.197
Pilonefritis.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.508
Sit back,

10:34.576 --> 10:36.339
OK?

10:37.563 --> 10:39.933
- Do you feel pain?
- Yes

10:39.934 --> 10:41.581
- Here?
- Yes

10:42.718 --> 10:46.245
Pilonefritis.

10:47.022 --> 10:50.219
- Can you die from it?
- Maybe.

10:50.325 --> 10:51.690
If ever you take care of that,

10:51.691 --> 10:53.055
but for that is that we
the doctors here.

10:53.161 --> 10:57.257
- I'm just playing golf.
- I do not know how to play Golf.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.334
I thought all
doctors playing golf.

11:01.002 --> 11:03.061
Ended.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.570
- Oh, hello doctor.
- Doctor is a pleasure to see again.

11:09.678 --> 11:12.613
How are you?
- Very well, responding to antibiotics.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.023
I could die!
Right?

11:16.318 --> 11:17.945
Just saying that could be serious.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.680
But this completely
under control.

11:20.188 --> 11:22.713
You say that if I had not come to
hospital in time, be dead?

11:22.791 --> 11:24.622
I did not say that.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.126
It's amazing to know how to save
people that way.

11:27.648 --> 11:29.161
I bet you an even,
know the name of this.

11:29.636 --> 11:32.764
- Philtrum!
- I told you I knew it!

11:38.874 --> 11:41.536
- Hello!
- Hey Rich.

11:41.610 --> 11:44.117
Hello Mrs. Nixon.

11:44.118 --> 11:46.625
He is my doctor said
I could have died.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.949
- Doctor Blank?
- Hey.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.111
What is good?

11:54.656 --> 11:57.124
- How's it going?
- Well.

11:57.225 --> 12:01.924
- You can walk or ...
- Then come back later.

12:03.665 --> 12:06.293
You say penicillin, right?

12:07.102 --> 12:09.263
- Yes
- Come with me, please.

12:27.556 --> 12:29.391
Mr. Sanchez is
penisilina allergic to.

12:29.392 --> 12:30.380
Do not say that?

12:32.694 --> 12:34.355
This tab is not even original ...

12:34.396 --> 12:35.658
I do not know what you mean.

12:36.698 --> 12:39.098
The orginal tab says NKAA, analysis.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.516
Well,
Would you ask?

12:40.517 --> 12:43.230
Speak English, why
you give penicillin?

12:43.738 --> 12:45.638
Because you're the doctor,
and I do what you say.

12:47.676 --> 12:50.277
- Ok, traigámosle a ...
- I took care of that.

12:50.915 --> 12:52.175
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?

12:52.247 --> 12:54.875
- To make an incident report.
- Why?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.474
This is an incident,
is the procedure.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.919
And can write this
legibly?

13:03.158 --> 13:04.281
What do you do?

13:05.093 --> 13:06.424
I am looking for the original tab.

13:06.928 --> 13:09.726
Sorry doctor, whatever it is
looking for is not going to find here.

13:09.998 --> 13:14.162
Hello beautiful,
here I leave you this gift.

13:24.980 --> 13:27.278
Is this seat taken?

13:30.919 --> 13:33.410
Look, look, look.

13:33.522 --> 13:37.147
Hey Nancy,
Will you sit here?

13:40.762 --> 13:42.753
So always.

13:48.803 --> 13:51.962
- Excuse me, excuse me a second.
- Yes, no problem.

13:56.952 --> 13:58.708
Doctor Waylans,
¿I can speak a second?

14:00.348 --> 14:01.940
Insurance.

14:04.352 --> 14:07.446
I wanted to ask about
incident reports.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.532
Is this thing on Mr. Sanchez?
Do not worry about that.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.358
But do not go on my record?
That's bad.

14:13.428 --> 14:16.522
I think not, I say, not a good thing.

14:16.965 --> 14:20.162
¿It would affect my application for scholarship
studying infectious diseases?

14:22.370 --> 14:24.463
I can not undo it,
if that is what you mean.

15:32.528 --> 15:33.764
<i> It looks good. </ i></i>

15:34.288 --> 15:38.653
Perfect <i> wanted to discuss it. </ i></i>

15:39.132 --> 15:43.482
You know, because I'm sick and
I'm in the hospital, if you have not noticed.

15:43.585 --> 15:46.611
Oh, please,
you're an idiot!

15:49.624 --> 15:51.455
Go to hell.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.722
I'm improving.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.064
So it seems.

15:58.266 --> 16:00.063
All right?

16:01.870 --> 16:05.362
Do you remember Rich?
Should end with him.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.974
- Do you have to end it?
- It's not my business.

16:10.045 --> 16:12.206
This is the most popular in school.

16:12.313 --> 16:15.373
I was never the kid
more popular in school.

16:16.217 --> 16:18.879
And now ... I am a doctor.

16:21.756 --> 16:25.214
- What will you do?
- Do not know.

16:26.628 --> 16:28.186
He's an idiot.

16:28.830 --> 16:32.561
It's hard to end it because we
been together a while.

16:33.134 --> 16:35.068
I mean, I do not know if I love or something.

16:35.103 --> 16:36.297
You know what they say.

16:36.337 --> 16:37.269
What?

16:37.372 --> 16:41.069
If you love someone, set them free.

16:43.411 --> 16:45.641
- Who says that?
- Sting.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.746
- What are you laughing?
- Who?

16:50.852 --> 16:53.082
Excuse me, doctor?

16:53.588 --> 16:55.749
I'm with a patient.

17:01.096 --> 17:05.109
I can not make these orders
until they are reviewed.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.740
Do not close the door.
Do not close the door.

17:27.387 --> 17:29.083
Hello Doctor!

17:31.392 --> 17:34.623
- Is having a rough day, right?
- No, I'm fine.

17:34.729 --> 17:36.822
Do not worry, I feel the same.

17:36.931 --> 17:40.833
Every day is a fight, only to
out of bed in the morning.

17:47.575 --> 17:49.475
What floor is, doctor?

17:50.011 --> 17:54.610
This is a hospital, the staff is supposed
to follow orders, right?

17:54.611 --> 17:56.678
Do doctors do not receive
a little respect?

17:56.785 --> 18:01.188
I do not know, perhaps,
probably not what you think.

18:02.824 --> 18:06.021
I just want things to be
as they are supposed to be.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.692
How long have you been
working here, Teresa?

18:10.799 --> 18:14.132
Do not you taught to deal with people like
in medical school?

18:14.202 --> 18:17.262
Just ignore them and do not follow the current.

18:17.338 --> 18:20.205
And then, bam! A heart attack!
Too bad!

18:21.810 --> 18:23.778
Just kidding, Doc.

18:25.119 --> 18:27.645
I think I know what I was thinking.

18:54.776 --> 18:56.710
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.273
How do you feel?
- Well I guess.

19:02.784 --> 19:04.615
What about that nurse?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.089
That was a misunderstanding,
All is well.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.092
Should not dismiss her, or something,
by yelling at a doctor?

19:13.194 --> 19:14.752
Probably.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.666
But I mean no problems.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.768
Am I cured?

19:21.870 --> 19:22.962
Almost.

19:26.007 --> 19:27.736
No more hospital?

19:27.842 --> 19:29.400
No.

19:30.511 --> 19:32.342
Will you give me some advice?

19:39.854 --> 19:43.381
Everyone says you're a good doctor.

19:44.692 --> 19:46.751
Maybe I should leave.

19:46.861 --> 19:48.419
Thank you.

19:49.197 --> 19:51.529
You're a good patient.

20:12.387 --> 20:15.823
Let's see, next.

20:15.924 --> 20:19.257
No pain, no stitches, she can
go from here.

20:19.327 --> 20:21.332
Only one more day, to be sure.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.914
No, I gave him high.

20:23.915 --> 20:26.630
Mr. Sanchez ...

20:34.950 --> 20:37.140
- Hello, is Dr. Diane?
- Yes

20:37.245 --> 20:40.703
I am the parent of D BC,
thanks for everything.

20:41.249 --> 20:45.276
- I just came to say goodbye.
- My wife has just brought the car.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.771
Any last minute advice?

20:47.772 --> 20:52.184
To take your pills
and is like new.

20:52.185 --> 20:56.597
Ok, we will.
My daughter took a shine with you.

20:56.598 --> 20:59.065
Fairly well cared for and ...

20:59.200 --> 21:02.472
I wanted you to invite
dinner at home on Friday.

21:04.205 --> 21:05.638
Friday?

21:06.808 --> 21:09.738
- Yes, on Friday would be fine.
- Great.

21:09.739 --> 21:12.104
You will have then.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.513
See you there,
at 8 o'clock on Friday.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.236
Hi Diane, you feel better?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.003
How do you feel?

21:43.077 --> 21:45.637
Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.486
- Is the doctor?
- Yes, hello.

21:56.557 --> 21:58.491
Hello, happens!

21:58.559 --> 22:00.857
Welcome to our home.

22:03.698 --> 22:07.725
- Oh, recalls Valerie, right?
- Hello, I love your jacket.

22:07.835 --> 22:11.236
- Thank you.
- He is our youngest son, Donny.

22:11.906 --> 22:14.204
- Hello?
- What is it?

22:14.275 --> 22:15.572
Not much!

22:15.676 --> 22:17.576
Sit down please.

22:20.748 --> 22:23.114
- Where is Diane?
- Left.

22:24.419 --> 22:28.014
I told him to stay, so they do not
seems spoiled.

22:28.089 --> 22:30.725
For in truth,
We are very grateful, but ...

22:30.726 --> 22:33.319
He's talking to Rich.

22:39.267 --> 22:41.462
How is being a doctor?

22:43.137 --> 22:46.732
Lots of work, a lot of responsibility,
but I like it.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.603
- How many operations a week ago?
- I still hospitalized.

22:51.712 --> 22:54.180
- What is that, as a test?
- Dony, not in the table.

22:54.282 --> 22:57.376
Let's mom
I can not say anything?

22:58.286 --> 22:59.947
I do not think it is just that.

23:00.922 --> 23:03.584
I bet they pay
very good doctors.

23:03.691 --> 23:04.919
Donny, please.

23:07.061 --> 23:10.497
It's less than you think, but is much
more than he earned at home.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.793
In addition, he earns more than you, Donny.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.241
Besides the money comes, when you enter
to a private, right?

23:21.576 --> 23:25.137
- Have a nice house?
- Yes, okay.

23:25.246 --> 23:27.646
- On the beach.
- Oh, I love the beach.

23:27.748 --> 23:30.296
You're so lucky!
I want to live ...

23:30.297 --> 23:32.845
on the beach, and know as much
on the human body.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.978
You seem like ...

23:35.089 --> 23:36.920
Do not be stupid!

23:37.458 --> 23:39.426
Valerie!

23:39.494 --> 23:41.962
- Mom!
- He started it!

23:42.063 --> 23:46.699
- Mom this was new!
- As he drops cum!

23:47.479 --> 23:48.318
No!

23:48.319 --> 23:50.829
Look you know what
nenesito you do, right?

23:50.872 --> 23:53.670
Honestly, Donny!

23:53.708 --> 23:57.265
- I'm so sorry doctor!
- Okay.

24:00.515 --> 24:01.834
¿I can use your bathroom?

24:01.835 --> 24:03.816
Sure, it's down the hall
in his right hand.

24:05.419 --> 24:08.286
What mom? it's not like a doctor
had never heard sperm.

24:14.095 --> 24:16.063
A thousand apologies.

26:53.354 --> 26:56.818
Ok, that's all.
Release tables.

27:01.962 --> 27:04.863
Blake,
Can we talk a minute?

27:04.965 --> 27:06.489
Clear.

27:10.571 --> 27:12.505
Sit down, please.

27:16.877 --> 27:19.869
Well, how's it going?

27:20.748 --> 27:22.079
Very good.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.148
Yes, all right?

27:26.487 --> 27:27.818
A little.

27:28.723 --> 27:30.452
Are you happy?

27:32.193 --> 27:33.592
Want some coffee?

27:35.563 --> 27:37.190
No, no thanks.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.537
I think we can talk about your residence.

27:41.082 --> 27:42.881
If this is about mr. Sanchez ...

27:42.882 --> 27:46.164
I just wanted to talk
of something more general.

27:47.346 --> 27:48.173
Tell me something Martin?

27:48.923 --> 27:50.937
When was the first time
you wanted to be doctor?

27:50.972 --> 27:52.879
- When?
- Yes

27:52.913 --> 27:54.778
Makes a long time ago, I guess.

27:54.815 --> 27:57.682
- Do you know why?
- Why?

27:57.752 --> 27:59.413
Because ...

28:01.389 --> 28:04.592
A friend of my mom was a doctor and,
was quite respectable, and ...

28:04.593 --> 28:09.534
I guess I always
have thought that, respect.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.167
And helping people.

28:15.218 --> 28:17.638
Yeah, well, people change
by all sorts of reasons.

28:17.639 --> 28:21.118
Sometimes I do not believe or think about it,
until they are here, face to face

28:21.119 --> 28:22.981
With all this, some
sometimes realize ...

28:22.982 --> 28:24.845
who are stressed,
are long hours and ...

28:24.846 --> 28:27.609
the nature of work is not
they thought it would be.

28:27.648 --> 28:30.139
It is not unusual for people to see that
maybe this ...

28:30.251 --> 28:32.742
- Not what you want after all.
- This is what I want.

28:32.820 --> 28:36.557
I can learn more, I just take something
time to learn your system.

28:36.558 --> 28:39.651
Actually I had no advantage
growing up or going to school.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.687
So sometimes I have to
work harder, and I do.

28:42.797 --> 28:45.095
But some of the nurses ...

28:45.514 --> 28:49.136
I thought we had a
career in chemical biology.

28:49.137 --> 28:52.037
That nurse is me
like a foolish child.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.305
Does not seem fair, but ...

28:56.076 --> 28:57.805
I do want to be here.

29:40.254 --> 29:44.315
Hi Martin, I am Valerie Nixon,
was very nice to see you the other night.

29:44.425 --> 29:46.256
Too bad you have
had to go so fast.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.851
My mom bought you a bag of
gifts, but give it forget.

29:48.963 --> 29:53.567
So I do not know if you want to arrange a time
to come and pick it up.

29:53.568 --> 29:56.798
Or it could leave the hospital.

29:57.144 --> 30:01.809
Or your department, if you want ...
So call us, I'll be home tonight.

30:01.810 --> 30:04.334
Ok, bye!

30:53.494 --> 30:56.697
- Oh, Doctor Blake, forward,
- Thank you.

30:58.751 --> 31:00.997
- I can bring some coffee or something?
- No thanks.

31:01.324 --> 31:03.711
Valerie called, Did he mention that there was something
I could collect?

31:03.712 --> 31:04.245
Yes.

31:04.246 --> 31:06.602
- But I hope in the hospital.
- Oh, right!

31:06.707 --> 31:09.403
- Could I use your bathroom?
- Certainly!

31:09.510 --> 31:12.104
Do you remember where is it?

32:21.415 --> 32:23.517
Oh, here.

32:23.518 --> 32:26.543
- Thank you.
- It's something to thank him.

32:27.021 --> 32:29.046
Thanks again Doc!

32:29.089 --> 32:31.614
Are there any instructions
Diane special?

32:31.692 --> 32:33.827
Only you finish your medicine.

32:37.607 --> 32:41.131
I thought it was just laziness, being
much time at home.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.534
I told you is Pilonefritis.

32:45.706 --> 32:48.300
I thought it was better.

32:50.544 --> 32:52.068
So it seemed.

32:54.548 --> 32:56.379
We will do some analysis
to be sure.

32:58.085 --> 33:01.953
But there are some resistors that are
difficult to treat.

33:07.995 --> 33:09.656
Hey, Doc.

33:13.467 --> 33:16.595
It's nice to have that pretty girl
back in 324 right?

33:18.038 --> 33:20.563
I do not think it is good that
speak well of the patients.

33:21.308 --> 33:25.642
Oh, I should not do it?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.086
What is this?
This is nonsense!

33:39.193 --> 33:42.526
- Forgot to give you something, Doctor?
- No.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.063
This is something else.

33:47.367 --> 33:51.536
See? was no reaction
penisilina, it was my mistake.

33:51.846 --> 33:55.457
It seems that all is well, it happens ...

33:55.458 --> 33:57.680
When someone does not
administers the medicine well.

33:57.681 --> 34:02.393
I'm not surprised because I never told
Teresa anything about these things.

34:03.617 --> 34:07.087
We will review,
How is everything?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.918
That girl Nixon, do you turn?

34:10.123 --> 34:13.456
Yes, said he took all his medicines.

34:14.128 --> 34:16.790
I will do a resistance test,
just to be safe.

34:16.897 --> 34:19.092
Very good, keep up the good work.

34:36.483 --> 34:39.782
- You can not zoom out.
- So it seems.

34:47.995 --> 34:49.860
Sorry.

34:51.165 --> 34:53.190
I do not.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.665
Do not want to go back to school?

35:01.275 --> 35:03.004
¿Rich?

35:06.880 --> 35:09.610
Now the virus is stronger.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.884
You'll be fine, soon.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.086
Do I have to?

38:07.027 --> 38:09.188
I'm so sorry, doctor.

38:09.484 --> 38:11.168
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

38:12.633 --> 38:15.328
They just say goodbye,
will not be here for anyone else.

38:15.369 --> 38:18.497
I missed the vincomizen Mr. Sanchez.

38:19.306 --> 38:21.900
I changed the sheet,
and just panicked.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.500
I just feel sorry for having
harmed to a patient.

38:24.611 --> 38:28.342
- Where was Teresa?
- No, she did not know anything about it.

38:30.050 --> 38:32.883
Oh, so sorry, I'll help.

38:36.957 --> 38:39.391
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.184
Sorry doctor.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.788
Good morning.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.794
Good morning.

39:17.864 --> 39:20.230
- How do you feel?
- Same, I guess.

39:23.437 --> 39:25.598
I uploaded a little temperature.

39:25.705 --> 39:27.536
I do not feel so bad.

39:28.141 --> 39:31.804
Not bad, but you may have
to stay a day or two.

39:32.479 --> 39:34.071
Is that bad?

39:34.147 --> 39:37.981
No, okay, while you are
coming to see me.

40:14.654 --> 40:16.622
God
Hey, Doc

40:18.725 --> 40:21.250
We were here, talking.

40:24.831 --> 40:27.925
- Did this woman is in the hospital?
- It's all good, brother.

40:28.001 --> 40:31.164
It's just a fun friend, just
she is fine.

40:31.271 --> 40:34.672
Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay.

40:34.774 --> 40:36.935
Doctor, I'm fine.

40:44.951 --> 40:47.112
What does down here, doc?

40:48.522 --> 40:51.047
Is there something that can help?

40:51.158 --> 40:53.319
Just leave here.

41:06.039 --> 41:09.167
Very well have to return you, Mandy.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.939
Good job, doc.

41:12.045 --> 41:14.843
Son of a bitch.

41:51.017 --> 41:55.852
- What are you doing here, at midnight.
- Yes, just had to finish some things.

41:55.922 --> 41:59.289
The patient has been a difficult case.

42:07.567 --> 42:11.128
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything is fine.

42:12.038 --> 42:14.370
Go home to rest, Doc

43:44.497 --> 43:47.830
My big concern is a
access, or some kind of bacteria.

43:48.268 --> 43:53.815
Oh, that's weird,
resistance we have seen this.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.560
Nomenzar would with a pair of
analysis.

43:56.561 --> 44:00.067
If not begin to stabilize, we
have to move to ICU.

44:00.068 --> 44:02.487
Keep it under surveillance,
How often the vigils?

44:02.488 --> 44:06.341
- Every two hours.
- Ok, let me know if you spend more.

44:08.321 --> 44:10.221
What does that mean?

44:10.724 --> 44:13.420
That your condition is a little more
hard we thought.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.171
We must ensure the
antibiotic, which you are enduring.

44:25.172 --> 44:26.160
What is that?

44:26.654 --> 44:29.717
- An infection intravenal.
- A intra what?

44:29.743 --> 44:32.371
The fluid is blood.

44:32.445 --> 44:33.947
Is that serious?

44:34.907 --> 44:36.108
It can be.

44:40.620 --> 44:43.214
I did not think that doctors
had to do that.

44:45.191 --> 44:47.056
I do not mind it.

44:48.695 --> 44:52.028
If I have to operate,
Would it be you that I operate?

44:53.366 --> 44:55.459
I do not trade.

45:00.006 --> 45:02.236
I do not want to cut people.

45:02.342 --> 45:05.641
The latter in internalized.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.373
- I did my job, right?
- It's what you do.

45:21.394 --> 45:22.827
I do not want to talk.

45:24.364 --> 45:26.332
Expected.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.058
I think too.

45:34.374 --> 45:36.069
Need descanzar.

45:36.142 --> 45:38.201
I know.

45:41.948 --> 45:45.213
- I can help?
- Yes, I look for Diane Nixon.

45:46.219 --> 45:48.244
I'm afraid I can not see you now.

45:49.155 --> 45:51.589
Look friend had a great
fight, I have only see two minutes.

45:52.392 --> 45:54.519
Not a good idea, let alone
only a little longer.

45:54.761 --> 45:56.194
Need descanzar.

46:01.668 --> 46:03.966
Can you give this?

46:04.070 --> 46:05.697
Insurance.

47:03.329 --> 47:05.263
You should be sleeping.

47:05.899 --> 47:08.060
I can not.

47:13.206 --> 47:15.231
What does the expert?

47:15.842 --> 47:18.572
He said it is a difficult case, but we
to work together on it.

47:19.479 --> 47:21.572
Everything will be fine.

47:25.084 --> 47:27.951
There's something I did not say.

47:29.222 --> 47:32.453
Before you return to the hospital.

47:34.694 --> 47:37.720
I do not know if all goes to make
I get sick again.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.741
What happened?

47:50.373 --> 47:53.178
Rich had sex with before
finish the medication.

47:54.180 --> 47:57.411
Could that have affected my situation?

47:57.517 --> 47:59.610
I think that was what happened.

48:02.355 --> 48:04.789
But do not think that you will
re sick.

48:07.427 --> 48:10.157
Sometimes you do things
he knows he should not.

48:10.196 --> 48:12.164
But I just can not avoid.

48:13.433 --> 48:14.832
Yes.

48:16.069 --> 48:18.094
I not die, right?

48:18.972 --> 48:20.462
No.

48:20.974 --> 48:22.908
Of course not.

48:24.077 --> 48:27.604
I always thought that if I was going to die,
would not until ...

48:29.549 --> 48:33.144
die if someone shoot me
stopping a crime, or something.

48:40.593 --> 48:42.584
I know it's stupid.

48:51.304 --> 48:54.364
Did you ever think you
in such things?

48:54.474 --> 48:56.499
When I was younger, maybe.

48:57.977 --> 48:59.808
It's silly.

49:01.481 --> 49:03.949
What imagined?

49:04.617 --> 49:08.246
I was thinking of entering the ocean and disappear
as if it never existed.

49:09.155 --> 49:11.180
And the world would be without me.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.885
I love the ocean.

49:41.421 --> 49:44.357
I'm not sure
have seen something like this before.

49:44.358 --> 49:46.621
It is a difficult case.

49:46.659 --> 49:52.222
I have seen this virus, but had never
seen one as resistant to everything.

49:52.265 --> 49:54.825
Have you been doing regular rounds
seeing if there is another virus?

49:54.901 --> 49:59.213
- Or something more advanced?
- I considered that, but nothing is ...

49:59.214 --> 50:00.737
Nothing has gone to 100%.

50:00.840 --> 50:04.241
I'm very happy, he did everything
what I would do in a case.

50:04.343 --> 50:06.811
What has been administered properly?

50:06.913 --> 50:08.312
Yes.

50:09.674 --> 50:10.249
Well Martin ...

50:10.250 --> 50:13.013
Seems to have landed
in a rather difficult.

50:16.856 --> 50:20.314
I did a protocol to treat it.

50:20.426 --> 50:23.863
Hell, I should have
left in my car!

50:23.864 --> 50:26.457
- I left it up, would you mind?
- No.

50:26.499 --> 50:29.900
- No, that's fine.
- A silver Mercedes.

50:30.937 --> 50:33.235
Back Fast!

51:53.156 --> 51:59.435
- You will not feel anything, does not hurt.
- Will you see me, when you want?

52:00.359 --> 52:01.883
Yes.

52:05.064 --> 52:07.589
So you're going to see the
inside my heart?

53:32.919 --> 53:34.511
Hey!

53:36.722 --> 53:38.553
How do you feel?

53:40.426 --> 53:41.950
Right.

53:42.561 --> 53:44.620
Just a little odd.

53:46.232 --> 53:48.962
They are putting you
drug in the blood.

53:50.336 --> 53:52.429
What's in pain?

53:53.539 --> 53:56.997
No, the truth is strange, I feel good.

54:04.817 --> 54:07.149
¿I can ask you a question?

54:07.253 --> 54:08.811
Of course.

54:14.593 --> 54:17.653
You're not married,
or have a girlfriend or something?

54:22.735 --> 54:24.965
Why you ask?

54:26.639 --> 54:28.207
Why not?

54:30.065 --> 54:31.506
You know how people are.

54:36.782 --> 54:39.046
Yes?

54:42.221 --> 54:44.951
For a while I thought
you liked my sister.

54:54.667 --> 54:56.225
No.

54:58.671 --> 55:00.400
Good, because it is a bitch.

55:01.240 --> 55:04.038
You do not want a girl like that.

56:30.329 --> 56:33.030
- I know, I did it myself.
- Where is it?

56:33.466 --> 56:36.669
Excuse me, who?
- Diane Nixon!

56:36.670 --> 56:39.614
- She was taken for an MRI.
- I see it.

56:39.615 --> 56:40.863
I do not know what you mean.

56:41.841 --> 56:42.705
Where is it!

01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:17.952
<i> Doctor Blake. </ i></i>

01:00:21.293 --> 01:00:23.557
<i> - Doctor Blake.
- Yes </ i></i>

01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:27.563
Sorry about yesterday,
Nixon for the girl.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.065
He seemed friendly.

01:00:31.036 --> 01:00:33.129
It was, thanks.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.035
- Doctor Blake?
- Yes?

01:00:41.775 --> 01:00:45.412
The Doctor is waiting Waylans
in conference room 3.

01:00:54.326 --> 01:00:56.521
You wanted to see me?

01:00:56.595 --> 01:00:58.256
Yes, Martin.

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:00.195
Sit.

01:01:10.509 --> 01:01:13.205
Is it the first time this has happened?

01:01:17.683 --> 01:01:19.344
Yes.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:23.612
I never wanted to happen, just ...

01:01:25.257 --> 01:01:27.418
I had it under control.

01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:41.629
Well talk to Sally,
she is a psychiatrist.

01:01:41.774 --> 01:01:43.435
Hello, Martin.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:46.407
It's always hard to lose a patient.

01:01:47.212 --> 01:01:49.581
Especially the first time.

01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:52.981
Do you question it?
Wondering if you made mistakes?

01:01:52.982 --> 01:01:54.962
If you missed something?

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.846
If you could be faster.

01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.824
These things happen.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.587
It is the other part of being a doctor.

01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:05.664
If there is anything
you want to express ...

01:02:05.665 --> 01:02:07.393
please do not keep it.

01:02:17.376 --> 01:02:19.844
¿I can ask you a question?

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.838
Ok.

01:02:23.816 --> 01:02:26.478
Did you cry today?

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.948
I did, yes.

01:02:33.926 --> 01:02:36.258
Very good.

01:02:37.095 --> 01:02:38.764
That is good.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.220
- Mr. Nixon.
- I have to talk to the doctor.

01:02:45.484 --> 01:02:46.796
- You killed my baby.
- Ok.

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:51.182
Mr. Nixon, really sorry for her
loss, but can not come here ...

01:02:51.183 --> 01:02:53.984
- And start to accuse my doctors
- That bastard killed my daughter.

01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:55.948
Is there a problem, sir?

01:02:55.949 --> 01:02:58.041
She was fine,
then came here and he killed her.

01:02:58.042 --> 01:03:00.814
Martin, let me handle this, that Mr.
infection was very difficult to treat.

01:03:00.886 --> 01:03:04.947
It was very rare, if she had not
taken all your pills ...

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:07.216
That could have given more power
to infection, do not know.

01:03:07.759 --> 01:03:08.851
She took her pills, told me.

01:03:09.428 --> 01:03:13.524
Do not blame the dr. Blake, supervised
throughout the case in everything he did.

01:03:15.367 --> 01:03:19.326
We did everything we could,
However, all of us.

01:03:24.576 --> 01:03:26.373
Lord, please
Am I with?

01:03:28.908 --> 01:03:31.247
- Sir?
- Let go, go alone.

01:03:34.286 --> 01:03:36.379
Bastards.

01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:46.090
It's all good, man.

01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:48.622
It is enough to have
to deal with guilt.

01:03:53.975 --> 01:03:55.566
It was a tough one.

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:59.190
Do not worry, they say
you're not a doctor ...

01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:01.505
really until
lose to a patient.

01:05:22.094 --> 01:05:24.062
Hey, you look like one of "Scrubs"

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:28.891
Hey, wait!

01:05:34.272 --> 01:05:36.672
How are you, Mr. Granger?

01:05:36.775 --> 01:05:40.677
Do not listen to Mr. Grangger truth,
crazy bastard.

01:05:42.681 --> 01:05:45.707
You must be relieved that you could
passing notation.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.149
It seems that the last
was quite difficult.

01:05:48.253 --> 01:05:50.881
One of the things
unfortunate to be a doctor.

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:53.014
Dealing with losses.

01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:56.290
That's being a doctor, right?.

01:05:57.195 --> 01:05:58.719
So it seems.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:02.789
You know what I thought it would
the best part of being a doctor?

01:06:02.868 --> 01:06:06.531
Women.
They love to doctors.

01:06:07.439 --> 01:06:11.341
- Do you already have a lady with you?
- By the way, yes.

01:06:14.713 --> 01:06:16.840
No, what do you mean?

01:06:20.252 --> 01:06:22.243
Come, come and see.

01:06:27.059 --> 01:06:30.995
- What is it?
- Well doctor, I wanted to ask you a question.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:34.900
On the relations between
staff and patients.

01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:37.232
That woman in the room supplements?
Forget it.

01:06:37.233 --> 01:06:41.104
No, that's not my question, I am more
interested in such a situation.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:44.198
Let's say a guy like me,
who likes to party.

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:47.107
A standard rate, regardless of my age.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.874
One day he decides to change everything.

01:06:53.251 --> 01:06:56.550
Before there was a girl, but just
death, as this guy ...

01:06:56.655 --> 01:06:57.956
takes the mattress,
and to his surprise ...

01:06:57.957 --> 01:07:00.092
find a book under it.

01:07:00.093 --> 01:07:05.257
Well, there are some things about a
Dr. young ...

01:07:06.665 --> 01:07:09.862
It seems they had something special.

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.438
My question is this:

01:07:14.539 --> 01:07:17.997
Think is wrong, ethically,
this situation ...

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:19.878
the fact of staying
with this book ...

01:07:19.879 --> 01:07:22.244
or give to superiors.

01:07:34.226 --> 01:07:36.057
Let's take a walk.

01:07:53.645 --> 01:07:54.737
Where do we go?

01:07:54.813 --> 01:07:59.428
Another reason would be
doctor, for prescribirme a better time.

01:08:00.919 --> 01:08:03.353
I leave party
and no one will see this.

01:08:03.455 --> 01:08:05.090
I can not do that.

01:08:05.091 --> 01:08:07.217
Well there is always
a way, right?

01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:39.656
Doctor?

01:08:42.294 --> 01:08:44.888
I have a question about this.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.779
- What is it?
- I can read it.

01:08:48.781 --> 01:08:51.500
It is something that has to
do with Mr. Granger.

01:08:51.603 --> 01:08:54.162
Yes, you may do it,
then yes.

01:08:54.238 --> 01:08:56.799
Ok, fine,
I just wanted to check it.

01:09:04.316 --> 01:09:07.376
- Need Help?
- No thanks.

01:09:07.484 --> 01:09:10.545
- What bothers you?
- What?

01:09:10.956 --> 01:09:12.924
That is for the stomach.

01:09:12.991 --> 01:09:16.825
And that's more for sneezing.

01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:19.122
I know, I'ma doctor.

01:09:19.163 --> 01:09:21.325
Ok ... Sorry.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.303
What?
¿4?

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:11.543
- They are difficult to obtain.
- I hope this is what I ordered.

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.778
Yes, well.

01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:16.914
- What's the book?
- What about him?

01:10:16.955 --> 01:10:19.924
- When you give me?
- You want it?

01:10:21.393 --> 01:10:23.884
We will not do this then.

01:10:25.964 --> 01:10:28.626
I believe there is another option, doctor.

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:46.376
Now switched to decaf?

01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:07.400
Health.

01:11:08.707 --> 01:11:11.335
I told you that the rotations
were not so difficult.

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:13.936
This time of year everything is easier.

01:11:15.046 --> 01:11:17.947
Martin!
I'm sorry about your patients.

01:11:18.383 --> 01:11:20.943
- It was a difficult case.
- Yes, it was.

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:24.012
I was doing a study on these
resistant virus, was waiting ...

01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:26.080
who may want help
to review this virus, in particular.

01:11:26.124 --> 01:11:29.361
If you saved your notes and cards.

01:11:29.362 --> 01:11:32.558
I heard that you are applying for
research grant.

01:11:32.597 --> 01:11:34.087
Yes.

01:11:34.132 --> 01:11:36.157
I think it's a good idea.

01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:38.192
Very good idea!

01:12:32.624 --> 01:12:33.818
What's up, Doc?

01:12:33.858 --> 01:12:35.985
- Is this the patient?
- Yes

01:12:37.028 --> 01:12:39.019
- James.
- Yes

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.055
I would like to talk to you
when you have time.

01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:44.126
Yes, I leave in 30 minutes.

01:12:44.169 --> 01:12:45.932
Clear.

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.229
Hey, buddy.

01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:14.925
Got it?

01:13:19.137 --> 01:13:20.500
It looks different.

01:13:21.206 --> 01:13:23.071
Is morphine.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.133
It's better than normal,
I want the book.

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:27.576
Yes .. I will soon.

01:13:27.979 --> 01:13:30.072
Really?

01:13:30.482 --> 01:13:32.882
No, it will not work for me
just keep bringing me things.

01:13:35.491 --> 01:13:36.281
Have fun!

01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:39.155
You know I will!

01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:42.992
What are you doing?
You can not take it here.

01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:44.824
Why not?
I'm out of service.

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.158
You should not drive
with that in the system.

01:13:47.198 --> 01:13:49.257
I have who takes me.

01:13:58.176 --> 01:14:01.009
What's up friend? Do not do
like a big deal.

01:14:01.513 --> 01:14:03.174
We are all human beings.

01:14:05.283 --> 01:14:06.910
What are you doing?
Do not follow me.

01:14:06.951 --> 01:14:09.010
- I'm just walking.
- Stay away from me!

01:14:17.095 --> 01:14:19.256
You're doing this more rare than
that has to be, friend.

01:14:20.265 --> 01:14:22.290
You know what?

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:24.301
- Want more?
- Yes, sure.

01:15:31.636 --> 01:15:34.366
- What is happening?
- I do not know, some kind of infection!

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.305
Call someone!

01:15:36.341 --> 01:15:38.172
I have it, I have.

01:15:38.173 --> 01:15:41.144
Jimmy, Jimmy!
Can you hear me?

01:15:42.447 --> 01:15:44.244
Jimmy, I'm Dr. Waylans!

01:15:44.282 --> 01:15:46.216
Jimmy!

01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:48.276
Jimmy, stay with me!
Jimmy!

01:15:48.319 --> 01:15:50.219
Stay with us.

01:16:43.741 --> 01:16:46.369
- He was sick or something?
- Do not know.

01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:49.847
He went into some kind of attack,
I tried to help.

01:16:49.881 --> 01:16:52.679
I would not be surprised if some
type of drug overdose.

01:16:52.717 --> 01:16:54.207
What makes you think that?

01:16:54.252 --> 01:16:56.015
These symptoms are very normal.

01:16:56.054 --> 01:16:59.387
Some nurses were
account may be abusing drugs.

01:16:59.424 --> 01:17:01.483
We had a scan, to confirm.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:08.788
Maybe you should go home, relax,
returns to be a doctor on Monday.

01:17:09.267 --> 01:17:11.167
Is it OK?

01:17:11.202 --> 01:17:12.897
Yes.

01:17:13.538 --> 01:17:15.938
Ok, ok if this detective
Doctor goes home?

01:17:16.374 --> 01:17:19.241
Well ... yeah, I guess.

01:17:19.277 --> 01:17:20.710
If you have any other questions or ...

01:17:20.745 --> 01:17:23.179
I do not know, we could be in contact
if you do not mind.

01:17:23.214 --> 01:17:25.114
Not at all.

01:18:30.281 --> 01:18:32.647
<i> - Dr. Blake?
- Yes </ i></i>

01:18:32.683 --> 01:18:35.243
<i> Detective Brown of the hospital. </ i></i>

01:18:35.286 --> 01:18:38.619
<i> said he could talk to you if
had more questions. </ i></i>

01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:40.851
Sorry <i> well come without warning. </ i></i>

01:18:40.892 --> 01:18:43.292
<i> course, pass. </ i></i>

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.180
- I can get you anything?
- No thanks.

01:19:06.551 --> 01:19:12.353
It seems that the pills mr. Vega
taken, were mixed with potassium.

01:19:12.757 --> 01:19:15.851
Do you know what that is?
- No.

01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:18.486
Well, something that I know.

01:19:20.765 --> 01:19:24.462
Some people suspected
who abused drugs.

01:19:24.502 --> 01:19:27.699
- Seems to have had a bad patch.
- I see.

01:19:31.242 --> 01:19:34.973
I mean, did not know him so well, perhaps
know to tell if you know better.

01:19:37.014 --> 01:19:39.073
Greeted him.

01:19:40.785 --> 01:19:43.083
- Have you ever saw him taking drugs?
- No.

01:19:44.021 --> 01:19:46.285
I hardly knew him, as I said.

01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:06.107
Do you have a pen
I can borrow?

01:20:12.717 --> 01:20:15.311
Thank you.

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:19.881
- Did you know him too little?
- Yes, very little.

01:20:20.825 --> 01:20:22.715
Not even that.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.187
I mean, he was ... not my type of person.

01:20:27.231 --> 01:20:28.823
Do you know where could
drugs have gotten?

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:33.030
- Do you think got into the hospital?
- No, they are very careful.

01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:35.836
Only a doctor can prescribe.

01:20:37.909 --> 01:20:40.309
Do you know a Doctor
he could deal given?

01:20:40.344 --> 01:20:44.440
Theoretically, a doctor can ...

01:20:44.949 --> 01:20:47.065
make a prescription
false for a patient ...

01:20:47.066 --> 01:20:49.181
but it would be unethical,
so do not.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.490
So ... Did a doctor may have
achieved something?

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.016
No!

01:21:01.198 --> 01:21:04.258
Do you know a doctor who may have
had any relationship with him?

01:21:04.635 --> 01:21:06.626
What?
No, do not know.

01:21:06.671 --> 01:21:09.162
As I said, I did not care much,
so do not go out much with him.

01:21:09.507 --> 01:21:13.273
Are there any other doctor,
maybe he did not like?

01:21:13.344 --> 01:21:15.676
Or they could have altered the
pills ...

01:21:17.548 --> 01:21:19.778
- With the ...
- Cyanide of potassium.

01:21:26.691 --> 01:21:29.990
Look, I'm sorry if you
it seems distracted.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:32.225
I understand.

01:21:33.731 --> 01:21:37.030
It must be difficult to return to normal
after seeing someone die like that.

01:21:42.406 --> 01:21:45.898
Yes. has been ...

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.173
Especially with it.

01:21:50.247 --> 01:21:52.272
Who?

01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:56.485
No one.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:01.053
Only one patient of mine who died.

01:22:01.092 --> 01:22:03.390
He had a rare infection.

01:22:04.095 --> 01:22:07.030
He started up his infection,
very rare.

01:22:07.064 --> 01:22:08.964
And in the end could not
hold your body.

01:22:10.635 --> 01:22:12.933
It was a difficult case, all are
agree with that.

01:22:16.774 --> 01:22:20.335
Not to sound a maniac but ...

01:22:20.745 --> 01:22:23.771
was not a good person, he
grotezcos comments to patients.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:26.207
I think I even could
have had something to some.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.808
As a doctor,
you can not do that.

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:34.157
Diane was a very pretty girl.

01:22:35.426 --> 01:22:37.121
We were very close.

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.356
In a way, with a ratio of
doctor / patient before he died.

01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:47.904
But that's over and I can
back to being a doctor.

01:22:47.938 --> 01:22:50.133
Is it a beautiful day, right?

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:54.910
Well you know where I am detective.

01:22:55.379 --> 01:22:57.370
If you have further questions.

01:23:13.664 --> 01:23:15.529
Excuse me.

01:23:33.651 --> 01:23:36.381
- Doctor?
- A second!

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.888
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no!

01:23:38.923 --> 01:23:41.153
All right!

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.988
Sorry, I have to collect
some things I need in the hospital.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:35.092
Do you have any other questions?
I'm afraid I'm a little late.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.967
Well, no ... I guess not.

01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:42.269
I'll let him get ready then.

01:26:51.382 --> 01:26:53.577
- Thanks for your help doctor.
- The pleasure is all mine.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:17.199
WBC 1237 at 10:49
is in prospect yet.

01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:19.436
I gave him some antibiotics, I am by
give him his third dose.

01:27:19.476 --> 01:27:22.805
- Time to put the time to 101.
- Yes

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.973
- Will it hurt?
- A little.

01:27:25.015 --> 01:27:27.540
But do not worry,
improved each time, make a fist.

01:27:27.584 --> 01:27:30.348
- Doctor!
- Yes?
