WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:11.094
So, what's on tap for today?

00:11.177 --> 00:13.430
Chidi's study group
should be off and running.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.640
We can go check in on how Brent's doing.

00:15.724 --> 00:19.561
If there's anyone that can turn that
ashhole into a good person, it's Chidi.

00:19.644 --> 00:23.273
My man used to collect action figures
of famous philosophers.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.818
"Ooh, Eleanor, look, it's a near-mint
Arthur Schopenhauer,

00:26.901 --> 00:28.737
-with a working quill!"

00:28.820 --> 00:29.946
What a dork.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.865
I love him so much.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.617
Chidi might make the new humans better
all on his own.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.078
It's so great he erased his memory.

00:37.579 --> 00:41.207
But, you know,
it's also quite sad, for you,

00:41.291 --> 00:45.128
in a way that I always think about,
and am respectful of.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.881
What the fork?

00:47.964 --> 00:50.216
Hi, Eleanor. Hi, Michael.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.218
We were just heading off for a picnic.

00:52.302 --> 00:56.931
Oh! You know, we were actually just gonna
go check in on your new student, Brent.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.892
Oh, I'm not sure Brent's in it
for the long haul.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.560
He came to one session,

01:00.643 --> 01:03.730
and then he said he got a B-plus
in Moral Values at Princeton,

01:03.813 --> 01:05.398
and so maybe he should be the professor.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.609
Then he asked me if I knew
that he went to Princeton.

01:07.692 --> 01:08.860
I said I did.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.905
Then he said he went to Princeton,
and he left.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.114
Eh, what are you gonna do?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.075
Well, just for argument's sake,

01:15.158 --> 01:19.079
what would Kant say about your duty
to help your fellow human beings?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.831
Well, honestly,
when the weather is this perfect,

01:21.915 --> 01:25.710
I think that Kant would say,
"Who's up for some frisbee golf?"

01:31.007 --> 01:33.551
Guys, you gotta hear this joke
I made about Kant.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.305
Never seen Chidi like that.
He was chillaxing,

01:37.388 --> 01:40.934
which is a word I just invented
combining "Chidi" and "relaxing."

01:41.017 --> 01:45.230
I guess once you have the burden of
saving humanity removed from your brain,

01:45.313 --> 01:46.356
life is dandy.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.024
Must be nice, Chidi.

01:48.107 --> 01:51.194
That's what's missing.
Chidi isn't being tortured.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.571
As far as he's concerned,
he did everything right on Earth,

01:53.655 --> 01:55.949
so now he just gets to enjoy himself.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.119
If we don't force Chidi
into stressful decision-making,

01:59.202 --> 02:01.746
he won't even have the chance
to become a better person.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.664
Right.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.875
If you wanna make a pearl,
you gotta get some sand in your clam.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.793
Oyster.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.379
We need Chidi to live in a world
of low-grade dread.

02:09.462 --> 02:10.338
I've got this.

02:10.421 --> 02:13.675
I have a ton of experience
making ex-boyfriends' lives miserable.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.803
First up, we fill his acoustic guitar
with wet cat food.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.389
Judge me all you want, I get results.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.939
-Janet, darling?
-Hi, there.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.108
-Ooh! You dyed your hair?
-I did.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.695
After I broke up with Jason, I researched
how humans cope with relationships ending,

02:33.778 --> 02:36.656
and number eight on the list was
doing something dumb with your hair.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.868
Number 42 was watch <i>Mamma Mia!</i>
<i>Here We Go Again, </i>so I did that, too.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.077
It was okay.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.954
It's just a lot of the same songs
as the first one.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.124
Well, hopefully "diving back into work"
was also high on that list,

02:46.207 --> 02:49.210
because we need to help John
and I know how.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.336
Spa day.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.296
"Spa day"?

02:51.379 --> 02:53.798
That's right, Janet.
I've cracked the code.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.427
See, in 2014, John wrote 11 articles

02:57.510 --> 03:00.763
mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation
at an exclusive resort in Bali.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.933
But then he researched cheap flights
to Bali for himself,

03:04.017 --> 03:08.187
and looked into something called
a "discount hotel package"?

03:08.271 --> 03:12.567
See, John's pettiness was the result of
feeling excluded by the rich and powerful.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.444
So, I, the rich and powerful,

03:14.527 --> 03:18.823
shall welcome him into an exclusive world
of luxury and pampering.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.241
Oh, he loves celebrity gossip.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.493
You should tell him how eight
different characters from <i>Game of Thrones</i>

03:22.577 --> 03:23.453
are based on you.

03:23.536 --> 03:27.373
That is a great idea.
See? You're getting it now.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.127
First, we open his pores
and then we open his heart.

03:31.210 --> 03:37.175
We exfoliate the dead skin cells of envy,
and we detoxify his soul.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.594
-Spa day.
-Spa day.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.554
-I'm so excited for spa day!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.432
I mean, I know I can eat
whatever I want and not gain weight,

03:44.515 --> 03:45.934
and the air is obviously perfect,

03:46.017 --> 03:48.478
and no one has any jobs,
or stress or problems,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.939
but I just feel like I need this.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.943
Well, you are in for a treat,
'cause I had Janet build an exact replica

03:55.026 --> 03:58.071
of Victoria Beckham's
ultra-exclusive private spa.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.072
Posh's spa?

03:59.614 --> 04:00.448
The Posh Wash?

04:00.531 --> 04:02.825
It's the most coveted invitation
in England.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.411
Membership is based
on weight and net worth.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.081
Gain a pound or lose a pound
and you're out.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.123
-Shall we go?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.211
Jason, there you are. We need your help.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.380
Okay, hand me the jar.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.384
-What?
-The peanut butter jar. Give it.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.012
You said you needed help
opening a peanut butter jar.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.222
No, we didn't.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.139
Oh.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.726
-Then who said that?
-No one. Shut up and listen.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.271
We need your help
with something very important.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.188
Are you sure?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.607
I'll probably just mess it up
like I messed things up with Janet.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.985
Dude, helping to save humanity

04:37.068 --> 04:39.320
is as good a way as any
to get over a breakup.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.489
It's not like Janet has a car you can key,

04:41.572 --> 04:43.408
or a house you can "Left Eye Lopes."

04:44.242 --> 04:47.453
Okay, I'm in. I got your back, guys.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.454
Now, hand me that jar.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.833
Are you speaking metaphorically?

04:51.916 --> 04:55.420
Like, the task we're embarking on
is a metaphorical jar

04:55.503 --> 04:58.298
you're gonna open
by accomplishing the task?

04:59.757 --> 05:01.467
Yes.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.722
Oh, goodie, cucumber water.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.892
Nope, this is fresh water
from Oprah's estate in Maui,

05:09.976 --> 05:12.854
with mushrooms from her private bog
in the Pyrenees mountains.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.148
Oh, my God, it tastes like candy.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.149
You know what they say,

05:16.232 --> 05:19.944
"A mushroom from Oprah's bog is
better than anything from anywhere else."

05:20.028 --> 05:22.447
I didn't know that they said that.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.116
I missed out on all
the cool celebrity sayings.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.617
Say goodbye to FOMO.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.121
You can finally experience
the best of the best.

05:30.204 --> 05:34.292
The only thing that would make this any
better is some hot goss.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.209
Very well.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.005
Our story begins when I ran into
Robbie Williams, Heidi Klum,

05:39.088 --> 05:43.134
and the remaining members of Fifth Harmony
at the Dolce & Gabbana spring show.

05:43.217 --> 05:47.138
Hate him, loathe her, over them,
cancel it, tell me everything.

05:47.221 --> 05:50.058
So Natalie Portman does
all of Scarlett Johansson's stunts?

05:50.141 --> 05:53.394
-Why?
-For the power. Just to say she can.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.521
Sure. I get that.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.484
Oh, Tahani, I feel amazing. Thank you.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.860
You're quite welcome.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.863
Hey, you know what would give you
an even more luminous glow?

06:03.946 --> 06:07.617
There was a sort of inner treatment
that was all the rage on Earth,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.410
the study of ethics.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.996
Think of it as a colonic,
but for your soul.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.790
Our resident philosopher, Chidi Anagonye,

06:13.873 --> 06:15.666
leads an ethics study group
in his apartment.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.919
What do you say you and I sit in?

06:18.002 --> 06:23.883
Would I like to use my time in heaven
to audit a philosophy class?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.927
Um...

06:26.010 --> 06:26.844
No.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.013
You stay crazy, girl. Bye.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.810
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.020
-So, how was the picnic?
-Oh, amazing.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.856
I mean, there were ants everywhere,
but they were so helpful.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.817
They carried our wine glasses
back and forth

06:40.900 --> 06:43.569
and they folded our napkins for us.
It was so cute.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.030
Wait till you see the otters
who do our turndown service.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.074
Listen, you might know Jianyu, the monk?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.368
He wants to join
your philosophy study group.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.411
Oh, sure, we can get that
up and running again.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.872
Maybe discuss some Lao Tzu and Confucius.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.499
Fun! Everything is so fun.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.416
Perfect.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.879
Um, just one thing. So, he's been having
kind of a hard time adjusting here.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.715
Apparently, monks aren't
the most social creatures.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.009
So, just promise me
you'll help him no matter what?

07:07.093 --> 07:12.306
Eleanor, I swear to you, I will look after
Jianyu as if he is my own brother.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.224
Wow.

07:13.307 --> 07:17.061
I mean, a promise from
a strict Kantian like yourself

07:17.145 --> 07:20.523
is just about the most ironclad agreement
in the universe.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.026
- Okay, buh-bye.
-Bye.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.864
So, Jianyu, would you like some--

07:27.947 --> 07:29.699
Yo, shut up for a sec.
I'm not a Buddhist monk.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.451
My name is Jason Mendoza,

07:31.534 --> 07:33.744
I'm a DJ from Florida,
and I'm not supposed to be here.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.456
You gotta help me out, homie.
I'm scared.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.584
Tea.
I was gonna offer you some tea.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.215
Dude, thanks to you, my dream came true.
I have a shiny new budhole.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.342
-You okay, homie?
-No.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.638
I've had a stomachache for a week.
There have been way too many close calls.

07:52.722 --> 07:57.852
Please, I beg you, no more meatball subs,
no more drawing boobs in the dirt.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.729
I cannot lie to cover for you.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.523
Please, remember,
you're supposed to be a monk.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.902
Hey.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.821
Eleanor and Michael are here.
What a fun surprise.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.573
-You've done some re-decorating.
-Oh!

08:10.656 --> 08:14.243
Uh, yes, my apartment was decorated
in one way

08:14.327 --> 08:16.454
and now it has been... redecorated.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.790
-And how is Jianyu?
-I mean, you know how monks are.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.125
Calm. Peaceful.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.669
Never, you know...
shotgunning Cheez Whiz.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.505
What monk would do that? No monk!

08:25.588 --> 08:27.215
Anyway...

08:27.757 --> 08:29.258
I see you guys are still here.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.427
We were just dropping by to ask a favor.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.514
Can you accompany Jianyu
to the luau tonight?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.225
He still isn't really engaging
with the neighborhood.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.560
We're hoping you could help him
break out of his shell.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.480
-Actually, I don't think I can make it.
-Oh, why not?

08:44.148 --> 08:48.528
I just remembered... I can make it,
so I will see you there.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.029
Okay. Bye.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.204
I don't understand why John
hasn't made more progress.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.122
You've done so much
to make him feel special.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.040
I know.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.043
I recreated the private tour of the Louvre
where they let you touch all the art.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.045
We rode Aquamans through the water.

09:06.128 --> 09:10.841
I got so many beauty treatments, I fear
my hair may be too shiny and lustrous.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.343
We've been getting on quite well,

09:12.426 --> 09:16.514
but every time I bring up
self-improvement, he just shuts me down.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.307
I haven't encountered this much resistance

09:18.391 --> 09:20.935
since I tried to get Timothée Chalamet
to go out into the sun.

09:21.018 --> 09:25.523
You know, I looked at John's files again.
He was hardly a shrinking violet.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.317
If you think he needs help,
maybe you should just tell him directly.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.485
Perhaps you're right.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.404
I shall go on the attack,

09:31.487 --> 09:35.491
just like six of the eight <i>Game of Thrones</i>
characters who were based on me would do.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.701
Yeah.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.996
-So, how are things going with Chidi?
-Super easy.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.665
All I have to do is be myself
and he's constantly freaking out.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.750
You have that effect on people, bud.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.335
What else can we do to mess up his life?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.713
Mmm, listen, E-Dog,

09:48.796 --> 09:53.926
I know people don't look to me for plans,
or ideas, or anything,

09:54.010 --> 09:55.553
but maybe we should ease off.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.013
He's pretty stressed already.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.348
Please. He's not even dry-heaving yet.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.808
How many Tums did he take today?

10:00.891 --> 10:02.435
-Like, 20.
- That's nothing.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.020
We don't stop until it's the whole bottle.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.148
Because the more miserable he is,
the more he's going to teach you,

10:07.231 --> 10:09.692
and then everyone,
and then he'll save humanity.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.695
He's like Superman with nervous diarrhea.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.031
Get ready.
I'm gonna make that speech soon.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.869
Hey, girl.
Wanna hit up the spa tomorrow?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.495
I wanna try that new
<i>Little Mermaid</i> treatment,

10:21.579 --> 10:22.997
the one where they remove
your vocal chords

10:23.080 --> 10:24.874
and it somehow makes
your legs look amazing.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.336
Perhaps, but I was hoping
to bend your ear on a more serious matter.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.213
The things you used to write, frankly...

10:32.131 --> 10:34.634
-were hurtful.
-What? Name one.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.845
I gained five pounds and you
called me "Ta-Hammy All-The-Meals."

10:37.928 --> 10:39.555
I mean, that's just poetry.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.891
You were so mean to Daniel Day-Lewis
he quit acting.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.392
Oh, I'm sorry,
was he "living in character"

10:43.476 --> 10:45.186
as a man who thought
he could pull off boot-cut jeans?

10:45.269 --> 10:48.105
You know what? I see what this is.
This has been a fake friendship.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.025
This whole week has just been
a wind-up to a sucker punch.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.027
No, it hasn't.

10:53.110 --> 10:56.280
I just want you to recognize
that your blog hurt people

10:56.364 --> 10:59.158
and you have a chance to be better here.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.828
B'scuse me?
You're telling me to be better?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.289
While you were gallivanting around
with your fancy friends,

11:05.373 --> 11:08.084
I lived in the real world,
so I had bills to pay.

11:08.167 --> 11:13.089
I worked 16 hours a day, by myself,
building a site with millions of readers.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.634
You're the one with issues, sweetheart.
If ya spot it, ya got it.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.886
Whoosh!

11:18.969 --> 11:21.180
That's another deuce
for the Gossip Toilet.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.852
Hello and welcome.
Is everyone having fun tonight?

11:29.271 --> 11:33.025
We have an exciting activity
planned for all of you.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.278
You have all been given
a magic lava stone.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.073
When you throw them into the bonfire,

11:39.156 --> 11:44.161
you will receive
whatever your soul most desires.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.706
-Step right up, Matilda. Give it a toss.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.175
My childhood pet,
Shell Turtlestein.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.678
- Hi.
-I wanna do that.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.973
No! You cannot,
under any circumstances, do that.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.975
Okay, but I gotta do that.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.935
No. If you throw that stone,

12:08.018 --> 12:11.647
your truest, actual desire will appear,
and who knows what that is?

12:11.730 --> 12:12.565
I do.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.609
My old motorcycle with Pamela Anderson
airbrushed on the side.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.236
It exploded a week after I got it,

12:17.319 --> 12:19.572
because someone wanted to see
what would happen

12:19.655 --> 12:21.699
if they poured lighter fluid
in the engine.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.867
Was that someone you?

12:22.950 --> 12:25.286
Yep. Turns out it explodes. Called it.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.873
Look, maybe Jianyu the monk
likes motorcycles.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.583
We don't know his life.

12:30.666 --> 12:35.504
No monk's truest desire is a motorcycle
with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.381
Oh, it wasn't her face.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.051
No, no, no.

12:43.888 --> 12:48.142
A sexually explicit motorcycle?
Whose rock was that?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.102
Yay!

12:50.186 --> 12:51.312
It's mine.

12:51.937 --> 12:56.150
Jianyu tossed my rock, uh,
because he wanted to help me,

12:56.233 --> 13:02.406
his friend, who loves motorcycles
and Canadian TV actress, Pamela Anderson.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.365
Thanks, Jianyu.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.118
And now, I will... ride it away.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.582
Can't wait to cruise the streets
in this bad boy.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.917
Yeah, man.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.627
Now we're cooking with gas.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.087
Well, this was a huge success.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.714
Chidi's an absolute mess.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.549
Oh, we should pop open some champagne.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.926
Call those magic ants.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.844
He's clearly being tested
like never before.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.971
Yeah, and now we need
to ramp up the pressure.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.307
Eleanor, he told an outright lie.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.101
We don't want him so freaked out
that he can't help anyone else.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.561
I think we did enough for the day.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.814
No way, dude. We can't stop now.
We have to push him to the edge.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.025
We have to knead his fragile psyche

13:38.108 --> 13:40.069
until he's hyperventilating
and losing his mind.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.739
Hi. Guys... Um...

13:44.448 --> 13:45.658
-Hey, can we talk?
-Yeah.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.409
I need to tell you a secret. I...

13:49.703 --> 13:50.538
I can't.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.920
No, no, no. Guys, guys, not now.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.968
I spent my whole life on Earth
battling a stomachache

14:04.051 --> 14:05.886
because I never knew what to do.

14:05.970 --> 14:10.182
And for a while here, that was gone,
but recently, I've been miserable.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.309
Why, Chidi?
You're in the Good Place.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.478
I know, but I have this problem.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.356
And if I choose Option A...

14:18.816 --> 14:20.943
But if I choose Option B...

14:21.026 --> 14:22.987
No.

14:23.070 --> 14:28.242
You know, Chidi, sometimes,
adversity can lead to growth.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.202
Whatever the moral dilemma is,

14:30.286 --> 14:33.289
maybe you'll come out
on the other side better for it.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.748
Yeah.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.959
No.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.713
I'm used to moral dilemmas.
I like moral dilemmas. They're my jam.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.299
-But this just feels like I'm...
-What?

14:43.382 --> 14:45.551
Like I'm being punished somehow.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.095
And, obviously, I know that's silly.
This is the Good Place.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.847
You two would never do
anything to hurt anyone.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.851
But I am seriously worried
that I did something wrong,

14:53.934 --> 14:56.937
and this is the universe
getting back at me.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.357
Oh, no.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.985
- What's happening now?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.404
Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.406
I made God cry?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.784
Oh, stomachache. Welcome back, old friend.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.829
Oh, I can't believe John.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.791
The man who once started a protracted
Twitter feud with Jacob Tremblay

15:17.875 --> 15:20.002
thinks that I'm the one with issues?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.171
Ugh. Maybe you need to be
even more direct with him.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.505
Like, punch him in the face.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.716
I don't know. I'm fired up.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.969
You've just been very nice to him and I
don't like the way he's treating you.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.763
Maybe it's not possible.
We're just too different.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.765
He spent his life
in the bowels of the Internet,

15:32.848 --> 15:34.934
jealous and miserable,
with no real friends,

15:35.017 --> 15:37.770
while I spent my life
in the upper echelon of society...

15:39.063 --> 15:41.815
jealous and miserable with...

15:43.067 --> 15:44.193
no real friends.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.529
Oh, Janet. I've been going
about this all wrong.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.114
Exactly. Here you go.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.407
Oh, uh...

15:50.491 --> 15:51.325
No.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.870
Why? Why are you crying?

15:54.954 --> 15:58.916
This is all my fault.
I promised I'd take care of you, Chidi.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.835
-You did?
-Yes. I promised.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.173
Uh, see, Chidi, the architect is
responsible for the entire neighborhood,

16:06.256 --> 16:10.761
so a resident suffering in any way,
it's very painful for her.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.429
Actually, come here, come here.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.306
But don't worry.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.810
We have a very simple solution
for problems here.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.979
-Oh, good. What is it?
-We eliminate them.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.523
So, you just tell us the problem,
and we'll eliminate it.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.691
Like, uh...

16:24.274 --> 16:25.818
say you had a problem with that vase.

16:28.112 --> 16:28.988
See?

16:29.071 --> 16:32.366
So, just tell me what's bothering you,
I'll wave my hand, it'll explode,

16:32.449 --> 16:35.119
and you can go back
to your otherwise perfect life.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.036
Uh...

16:37.496 --> 16:40.499
The motorcycle. Yup, that's my problem.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.501
For some reason,
it just hasn't been bringing me

16:42.584 --> 16:44.837
as much happiness
as maybe it was intended to,

16:44.920 --> 16:47.965
-so I'd just as soon get rid of it.
-Done.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.718
Oh, not again.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.096
-No more motorcycle. Problem solved.
-Great.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.057
-Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.976
No, no, she'll be fine. She'll be fine.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.021
John? I have something to say.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.689
Round two? Let's do this.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.443
In 2007, Blake Lively invited me
to a birthday party

17:07.526 --> 17:10.446
held for Leonardo DiCaprio
aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.531
Hmm, I see we're dropping names
three at a time now.

17:12.614 --> 17:16.952
The guest list was 100 of the wealthiest,
most famous members of the glitterati.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.663
Once aboard,
I discovered there was a VIP deck.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.750
And within that area, there was
an even more exclusive room

17:22.833 --> 17:26.211
that you could only access with
a secret PIN, which I promptly entered.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.880
And guess who was waiting for me?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.091
I hate to admit it,
but I have to know. Who?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.092
No one.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.844
I was the only one there.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.013
The party raged on outside,

17:36.096 --> 17:39.850
but I was so obsessed with status
that I never left.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.478
I spent the entire night
talking to no one.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.522
Riveting story.
If only it were longer and sadder.

17:45.606 --> 17:50.569
The point is, if all you care about
in the world is the velvet rope,

17:50.652 --> 17:53.947
you will always be unhappy,
no matter which side you're on.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.575
You and I are proof of that.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.243
But now we're here.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.038
Can we just start over?

18:01.955 --> 18:02.790
Well...

18:03.707 --> 18:06.835
if we're gonna be friends,
I need to say something.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.673
I really am sorry for all the posts
I wrote about you.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.592
And everything I tweeted.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.595
And scrawled on the back of a <i>Playbill</i>
during the intermission of <i>Wicked,</i>

18:16.678 --> 18:18.764
and had someone pass it to you
and say it was from

18:18.847 --> 18:20.224
an anonymous, concerned citizen.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.767
-That was you?

18:21.850 --> 18:25.145
Well, my bangs were
"making my ears look chunky."

18:25.229 --> 18:26.105
That was a fair hit.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.400
It's a lovely night.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.486
Would you like to go for a walk?

18:39.493 --> 18:42.204
-Hey, Jason? New plan.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.749
Instead of just trying to not get caught,
we're going to study ethics.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.669
I'm going to help you
become a good person.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.420
Oh, dope. I always wanna get better.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.923
That's why I spent so much
of my time at the free clinic.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.427
Hang on, just editing my syllabus
in my head based on that comment.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.804
This is gonna be awesome. You rule.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.640
You're like the Pam Anderson
boob-motorcycle of people.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.809
Thank you. That's an amazing compliment.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.937
And I'm sorry
your actual motorcycle blew up.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.230
That's okay, homie.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.232
That's just what motorcycles do.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.027
So, Chidi's set with Jason now.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.156
-How are you doing?
-A little better...

19:17.823 --> 19:18.949
but still terrible.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.244
You were torturing him
because that's what we had to do.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.162
I know.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.038
I went too far.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.875
And what's worse, I liked it.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.463
Because I'm angry at him for leaving me,

19:34.339 --> 19:38.927
which isn't even remotely fair,
because he sacrificed himself for us,

19:39.011 --> 19:42.389
but I'm still angry he abandoned me,
which makes me feel guilty,

19:42.472 --> 19:45.267
which makes me angry,
which makes me want to talk to Chidi,

19:45.350 --> 19:47.728
because he's the person
I go to when I'm angry.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.980
So, it's a real fun cycle.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.652
I still don't have a grip
on the human emotional spectrum.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.739
You guys are often happy
when you should be sad,

19:58.822 --> 20:00.449
and angry when you should be happy,

20:00.532 --> 20:02.701
and texting when you should be driving,

20:02.784 --> 20:06.455
which is not an emotion, I know,
but it's insane.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.707
The point is, in this case,

20:08.790 --> 20:13.378
even if it's not rational,
you're allowed to feel a little angry.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.963
Let yourself off the hook.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.758
Process it and work your way through it.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.595
And then get your shirt together,
because we have a lot of work to do.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.264
Morning, all.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.059
Anyone interested in a status report?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.728
I win! I mean, I'll start.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.689
I have made massive progress with John.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.900
Great. Is he gonna join Chidi's class?

20:34.983 --> 20:37.069
Philosophy may not be his way forward.

20:37.152 --> 20:41.031
Genuine human connection
shall be his course of study.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.866
And first up on the syllabus,

20:42.950 --> 20:45.827
he and I will be unironically watching

20:45.911 --> 20:48.705
the Britney Spears movie
<i>Crossroads</i> together...

20:48.789 --> 20:51.083
and you'll have to trust me,

20:51.166 --> 20:53.835
this is a huge step
in the right direction.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.379
Wonderful work, Tahani.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.048
And, Jason, I mean, bravo.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.175
Thanks, guys.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.094
It's been a tough couple weeks,

21:02.177 --> 21:07.641
and it just felt really good to be brainy,
and have... use-ness.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.934
Sure, bud.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.061
Well, I think we can finally say

21:11.144 --> 21:14.022
that all four of these mofos
are on the right path.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.566
So... what's next?
