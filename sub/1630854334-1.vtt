didn't he write that book?

-Famous playwright.
-<i> Anyway,</i>

02:20.249 --> 02:22.645

02:23.978 --> 02:25.681

02:30.655 --> 02:31.852
I might just stay here forever.

02:31.887 --> 02:33.293
So plan accordingly.

02:33.328 --> 02:35.559
Yeah. Yeah.

02:35.594 --> 02:37.264

02:37.299 --> 02:40.861

03:52.000 --> 03:53.901
-But you are single.
-Yeah,

you don't have anything bigger?

04:02.648 --> 04:05.880

06:25.619 --> 06:28.990
That's a great cover.
It sound eerily close
to the original song.

06:29.025 --> 06:30.090
I'd hope so.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.663
You take any requests?

06:31.698 --> 06:34.028
Nope, I only play originals.

06:38.034 --> 06:39.506
Oh, wow.

06:39.541 --> 06:41.475
Okay, yeah,
I feel like an idiot.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.906
Here I am offering five euros
to famous musician.

06:43.941 --> 06:46.579
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch.
I'm not famous.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.944
Oh, wow. You're Josie Day.

06:48.979 --> 06:50.847
-I think so.

06:50.882 --> 06:55.852
Wow. I am Hal. Hal--
Hal Flynn. Just wow.

06:55.887 --> 06:59.592
Stop saying wow.
Wait, you're not one of those
cruise ship people, are you?

06:59.627 --> 07:01.187
-I'm sorry?
-How'd you get here?

07:01.222 --> 07:04.025
Planes, trains and automobiles,
in that order, actually.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.829
You know, you missed
tourist season.

07:05.864 --> 07:06.929
It, like, just ended.

07:06.964 --> 07:08.634
No. I'm not a tourist.

07:08.669 --> 07:10.570
You're definitely not a local.

07:10.605 --> 07:13.540
Well, I'm not here
to do touristy things.

07:13.575 --> 07:16.202
Then what are you here for?

07:16.237 --> 07:18.644
Hmm.

07:18.679 --> 07:21.911
Hate to interrupt your playing,
but would you do me a courtesy

07:21.946 --> 07:24.045
and take my photo,
just like this?

07:24.080 --> 07:27.180
Courtesy? Why, yes, sir.

07:27.215 --> 07:29.655
Oh. Beautiful. Who is she?

07:31.923 --> 07:34.858
There you go.

07:34.893 --> 07:37.124
Well, let me do you one better.

07:37.159 --> 07:39.225
This was definitely not
shot on an iPhone,

07:39.260 --> 07:41.964
and I happen to know a cute,
little Mom and Pop shop

07:41.999 --> 07:44.197
down the road that
still develops. Can I?

07:44.232 --> 07:46.298
Uh, yeah, sure.
But if you can still

07:46.333 --> 07:48.201
get one on the phone too,
if you don't mind?

07:48.236 --> 07:50.577
Yeah. Of course.

07:50.612 --> 07:52.513
-I think she stood there.
-Okay.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.050
Okay.

08:02.085 --> 08:04.019
So I take it
you've been here before,

08:04.054 --> 08:05.559
uh, Taormina?

08:05.594 --> 08:07.088
-Once or twice.

08:07.123 --> 08:09.794
Well, I've been in Sicily
for a couple of hours

08:09.829 --> 08:11.994
and I haven't eaten
which is a cardinal sin

08:12.029 --> 08:14.700
if I am not mistaken.
Uh, any recommendations?

08:14.735 --> 08:17.703
-You wanna know a secret?
-Of course.

08:17.738 --> 08:19.936
Wander into any one
of these places

08:19.971 --> 08:22.576
and you will have
the best pasta and wine

08:22.611 --> 08:24.611
you've had in
you're entire life.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.844
-Hmm.

08:26.879 --> 08:29.781
-And there we go.

08:29.816 --> 08:31.178
Think I got a few good ones.

08:31.213 --> 08:32.982
-Great.
-Your stuff.

08:33.017 --> 08:35.886
Thanks. Um...

08:35.921 --> 08:39.923
thank you for the...
the photo and the song. I'm...

08:39.958 --> 08:42.959
-I'm a fan.
-Of course.

08:42.994 --> 08:44.323
Uh...

08:52.201 --> 08:53.332
Hey, Hal?

09:06.314 --> 09:07.984
This place is pretty dead.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.656
Yeah, people don't go out
till late here.

09:09.691 --> 09:11.724
Restaurants don't even
open until- 00.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.154
Ugh, I'd wither away.

09:13.189 --> 09:15.255
Where are you staying?

09:15.290 --> 09:16.630
Uh, Hotel Victoria.

09:16.665 --> 09:18.390
Mm, Oscar Wilde.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.161
Precisely, how'd you know?

09:20.196 --> 09:22.328
Oh, they put signs around
for the tourists.

09:22.363 --> 09:25.298
Mm. This is seriously amazing.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.904
Oh!

09:26.939 --> 09:30.303
-So you're a writer?
-Uh...

09:30.338 --> 09:32.074
That's a pretty big leap.

09:32.109 --> 09:34.208
You're not here
for touristy things,

09:34.243 --> 09:37.310
you're staying at
the Hotel Victoria,

09:37.345 --> 09:41.050
-you carry around this notebook.
-Okay, okay. Sure.

09:41.085 --> 09:43.382
Not a writer, but more,
um, aspiring.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.087
So you're modest.

09:45.122 --> 09:46.858
No, realistic. I enjoy it,

09:46.893 --> 09:49.058
but there are just
so many out there that--

09:49.093 --> 09:52.292
Mm. This is seriously
life-changing. It's-- it's--

09:52.327 --> 09:54.866
-What you got?
-I think it was a Tagliatelle.

09:54.901 --> 09:58.166
No, I mean your notebook.
Read me something.

09:58.201 --> 09:59.431
What, now?

09:59.466 --> 10:03.204
No, in 15 minutes.
I'll set a timer.

10:03.239 --> 10:04.436
Yes, now.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.042
No way,
you're a famous musician.

10:06.077 --> 10:08.341
Oh, my gosh.
I am not a famous musician.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.244
I have one semi well-known song,

10:10.279 --> 10:11.751
and nothing since.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.313
And nobody even knows
who I am

10:13.348 --> 10:15.183
except for you, apparently.

10:15.218 --> 10:16.921
Okay. People know who you are.

10:16.956 --> 10:21.387
Hal, I'm getting impatient.

10:21.422 --> 10:24.896
Okay, fine. I have this...
this poem of the day.

10:24.931 --> 10:27.393
It's stupid short stuff, but--

10:27.428 --> 10:29.230
Sounds perfect.

10:32.301 --> 10:34.301
Normally, I wouldn't
share these with anyone.

10:34.336 --> 10:37.337
Well, normally,
you wouldn't be in Taormina.

10:37.372 --> 10:39.713
Okay. But you have to
promise me something.

10:39.748 --> 10:42.276
Okay. You can't do that thing
where you pretend to like it

10:42.311 --> 10:44.080
even if you don't, okay?
I'll know.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.250
Why are you not talking?
It's just making me
even more nervous.

10:49.285 --> 10:50.416
Hal, you're stalling.

10:50.451 --> 10:53.386
Oh, gosh, okay.

10:53.421 --> 10:54.387
Um...

10:57.293 --> 10:59.359
"I waltz through this wave
of strangers.

10:59.394 --> 11:01.229
Their conversations,

11:01.264 --> 11:05.002
they topple over each other
and it sounds somewhat like,

11:05.037 --> 11:06.333
well, like rain.

11:06.368 --> 11:09.138
For now, I'm lost
and well, that's okay.

11:09.173 --> 11:10.942
See, I'm happiest when I'm lost

11:10.977 --> 11:13.879
because I learn to be
happy with myself.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.815
I'm reminded
of a thought though,

11:15.850 --> 11:19.049
of the time
my parents were children too.

11:19.084 --> 11:22.481
On the topic of children,
there they are over there,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.758
a few playing soccer
on the piazza,

11:24.793 --> 11:26.518
two restaurant chairs
as their goal

11:26.553 --> 11:28.058
and that's enough for now.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.996
The town is big
while they're small,

11:32.031 --> 11:34.493
it will grow small
as they grow taller.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.837
And, hey, it really does.
You're right.

11:37.872 --> 11:40.840
The sun shines differently here

11:40.875 --> 11:41.874
effervescent bright."

11:46.815 --> 11:48.342
-Hal, I need you to look at me.
-Nope.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.477
Right this instant.

11:55.318 --> 11:58.022
-You're good.
-You promise you wouldn't--

11:58.057 --> 11:58.957
You're good.

12:01.962 --> 12:04.358
-You're just being nice.
-No.

12:04.393 --> 12:06.228
But I am a little buzzed.

12:06.263 --> 12:09.495
And that jet lag
is not gonna cure itself.

12:09.530 --> 12:11.134
You should get some sleep.

12:11.169 --> 12:12.806
Of course. Right.

12:12.841 --> 12:13.972
Do you want me to walk you?

12:16.207 --> 12:17.437
Yeah, I'd like that.

12:20.277 --> 12:22.915
Could I have your coaster?

12:22.950 --> 12:23.850
Sure.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.820
<i>Grazie.</i>

12:36.293 --> 12:40.559
Oscar Wilde arrived
in Taormina in 1898.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.066
Well, there you have it.

12:42.101 --> 12:44.035
Uh, I'll get these photos
to you tomorrow?

12:44.070 --> 12:45.333
Who needs the time, thank you.

12:45.368 --> 12:47.005
Should we meet at the fountain
at four?

12:47.040 --> 12:49.436
Uh, yeah, I think I should be
awake by then.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.880
Okay. Here.

12:56.181 --> 12:58.214
Hmm.

12:58.249 --> 13:00.282
All right. Think I have
a little something here.

13:04.486 --> 13:07.058
There you go.

13:07.093 --> 13:11.128
"To now,
the memory of tomorrow."

13:11.163 --> 13:13.196
Hey, so, should we exchange
numbers or something?

13:13.231 --> 13:15.066
Just in case, you know,
anything comes up or--

13:15.101 --> 13:19.268
Let's do this
the old fashioned way,
Mr. Oscar Wilde.

13:19.303 --> 13:22.502
We have a time and a place
and I'll be there.

13:22.537 --> 13:24.009

15:31.600 --> 15:33.732
in like, two or three days.
When do you leave again?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.075
Uh, I'm here for a week.

15:36.110 --> 15:39.408
Quick question. What are these,
like extra, extra small or--

15:39.443 --> 15:41.674
That's how they do it here.
It's an Americano.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.577
This is as big as it comes.

15:45.284 --> 15:46.580
Quality over quantity.

15:46.615 --> 15:48.483
Yeah.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.584
Okay. Let's go.
I wanna show you something.

15:50.619 --> 15:53.092
Is it the Greek theater?
I wanna see it so bad.

15:53.127 --> 15:55.325
I though you said
you weren't a tourist, Hal.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.129
-What do you mean?
-Okay. Well, yeah,

15:57.164 --> 15:58.559
we could go wait in line

15:58.594 --> 16:01.331
and we can listen
to tour guides ramble on and on,

16:01.366 --> 16:04.433
but I really wanted to show you
one of the best views
in Taormina.

16:04.468 --> 16:06.105
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.

16:06.140 --> 16:07.238
Let's go.

16:27.260 --> 16:30.261
Hey, uh, quick question.

16:30.296 --> 16:32.296
Are you taking me
to Narnia or what?

16:32.331 --> 16:34.760
Okay. It is right up here.

16:34.795 --> 16:37.103
You told me it is
the best view of Taormina

16:37.138 --> 16:38.599
and I'm training
for a triathlon, Josie.

16:38.634 --> 16:40.469
Oh, you are fine.

16:45.608 --> 16:47.707
This is-- this is
just incredible.

16:47.742 --> 16:50.248
Told you.

16:50.283 --> 16:52.085
Hey, what's that?

16:52.120 --> 16:53.317
It's a little turn of phrase.

16:53.352 --> 16:55.418
-Poem of the day?
-Maybe.

16:55.453 --> 16:57.420
Okay, well, share.

16:57.455 --> 16:59.719
-No, no way you're putting me
through that again.
-Come on.

16:59.754 --> 17:02.128
Well--
I just started. All right?

17:02.163 --> 17:03.459
Maybe a little bit later.

17:03.494 --> 17:05.131
-Okay, I'll hold you to that.
-Yeah.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.662
If you won't share, I will.

17:08.697 --> 17:10.829
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

17:10.864 --> 17:16.340
I cooked up this little melody
last night.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.738
Might sound familiar.

17:18.773 --> 17:21.477
Okay. I much prefer to be
on this side of things,
by the way.

17:21.512 --> 17:22.643
Shut up.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.220
-Uh, there's no chorus.
-Okay.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.716
No chorus yet.
Just the verse.

17:31.522 --> 17:34.325
<i>♪ To now ♪</i>

17:36.230 --> 17:38.890
<i>♪ To now ♪</i>

17:38.925 --> 17:44.269
<i>♪ It's the memory of tomorrow ♪</i>

17:44.304 --> 17:49.109
<i>♪ The memory of tomorrow ♪</i>

18:00.749 --> 18:02.584
-Why'd you stop?
-I don't know,

18:02.619 --> 18:04.586
hearing it again,
it's no good.

18:04.621 --> 18:06.456
Are you kidding me?

18:06.491 --> 18:07.919
No, it's no good.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.163
Josie, look at me.

18:10.198 --> 18:11.263
You're good.

18:13.861 --> 18:17.236
-No. Back to the drawing board.
-Ugh, you're out of your mind.

18:19.471 --> 18:21.834
It was really good though.

18:21.869 --> 18:23.209
I mean, I wrote it, so...

18:25.906 --> 18:27.279
I want 50 percent.

18:28.744 --> 18:30.183
You'll get 49.

18:40.426 --> 18:41.788
How'd it go?

18:41.823 --> 18:44.263
<i>♪ To now ♪</i>

18:44.298 --> 18:47.464
<i>-♪ The memory of tomorrow ♪</i>
-Okay.

18:47.499 --> 18:48.894
Is that how it went?

18:48.929 --> 18:51.204
-It's close. It's close.
-It was good. I liked it.

18:51.239 --> 18:53.206
-I thought it was pretty good.
-Lived it better

18:53.241 --> 18:55.274
Well, I'm this way.

18:55.309 --> 18:56.902
I'm that.

18:56.937 --> 18:59.674
Look, Hal, I know you didn't
come all the way to Sicily

18:59.709 --> 19:01.775
-to hang out with me.
-I didn't?

19:01.810 --> 19:04.448
But if you're free tomorrow,

19:04.483 --> 19:06.516
I do happen to know
a cool spot.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.881
And I still have to
get you those photos.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.752
Let's see, tomorrow,
I'm doing a lot of
wandering around,

19:11.787 --> 19:14.392
um, just staring off
into the distance aimlessly.

19:14.427 --> 19:15.888
Yeah. I think tomorrow
could work.

19:15.923 --> 19:17.362
Should we finally exchange info?

19:19.498 --> 19:22.763
Um, no. Old-fashioned.

19:22.798 --> 19:24.567
Then we need a time and place.

19:24.602 --> 19:27.834
Let's do... noon at my hotel.

19:27.869 --> 19:29.440
You better show up.

19:29.475 --> 19:31.937
-Well, yeah, I'll show up.

19:31.972 --> 19:34.643
<i>-Buona sera.</i>
<i>-Anche tu.</i>

19:34.678 --> 19:36.711
-Very good.
-Thank you.

19:36.746 --> 19:39.010
Oh, hey, I finished it,
by the way.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.287
The poem, it's called "Luca."
You want to...

19:43.984 --> 19:47.722
"From here, I saw hundreds
of honey-gold street lamps.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.592
They were tripled
along the stones,

19:49.627 --> 19:51.726
hundreds, but I only
thought of one.

19:51.761 --> 19:55.928
A trail of blue
fogged by the smoke
of Signore Lucas Monticarlo.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.931
He smirked as two young lovers
shared their first kiss.

19:58.966 --> 20:00.702
A first, he knew,

20:00.737 --> 20:03.738
for both said 'Whew'
right after.

20:03.773 --> 20:06.642
He lowered his eyes
to his wing tip
olive-green shoes,

20:06.677 --> 20:08.446
and blinked.

20:08.481 --> 20:10.712
That blink was a minute
and that minute turned two.

20:10.747 --> 20:14.320
Tomorrow turned yesterday
and time already flew.

20:14.355 --> 20:18.324
The boy was him and this day
when they first met,

20:18.359 --> 20:19.886
he recalled how he missed her

20:19.921 --> 20:21.690
and she wasn't even gone yet."

20:24.024 --> 20:26.860
Such a cool guy, huh?

20:26.895 --> 20:27.894
If you say so.

21:29.562 --> 21:30.858
Come on, keep up.

21:30.893 --> 21:32.123
Come-- Oh, yeah.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.828
Where the hell
did you come from?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.375
So this is one of
my favorite spots to write,
in all of Taormina.

21:42.410 --> 21:44.377
Anyone can come here,
free of charge,

21:44.412 --> 21:46.478
and just enjoy the scenery
and ruins.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.547
And there is the amphitheater,
it's right up there.

21:49.582 --> 21:52.110
Oh, my goodness. This is crazy.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.651
I mean, I never read anything
about this place.

21:54.686 --> 21:56.686
Sounds like you need
a good tour guide.

21:56.721 --> 21:58.523
Well, it looks like
I found one.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.979
Mm-mm-mm.

22:26.014 --> 22:27.948
Another ten out of ten
on the cuisine.

22:27.983 --> 22:30.082
I mean, do they have
bad food around here?

22:30.117 --> 22:32.051
If there is, I haven't found it.

22:32.086 --> 22:33.921
Oh, my gosh.
And the architecture.

22:33.956 --> 22:35.087
I mean, you have this--

22:35.122 --> 22:36.858
this ancient Roman sculpture

22:36.893 --> 22:38.761
right next to a building
with all these new additions.

22:38.796 --> 22:41.896
-I mean, it's nuts.
-Greek.

22:41.931 --> 22:43.634
-I'm sorry?
-Well,

22:43.669 --> 22:45.438
it was Greek for five centuries

22:45.473 --> 22:47.440
before the Romans came over.

22:47.475 --> 22:48.903
So you know a lot
about this stuff.

22:48.938 --> 22:51.202
-I've overheard a lot of
tour guides.
-Well...

22:51.237 --> 22:52.841
I mean, you go to a place
like Boston

22:52.876 --> 22:55.877
and they're just so reverent
with the history.

22:55.912 --> 22:58.649
But here, it's sort of like
they can pay respects

22:58.684 --> 23:01.146
without being too precious.

23:01.181 --> 23:02.917
I never thought about it
like that.

23:02.952 --> 23:05.854
It's just like you said.
Perfect blend of old and new.

23:05.889 --> 23:08.153
Ah. All right.

23:08.188 --> 23:09.858
Oh, before I forget.

23:12.797 --> 23:14.797
Oh, my gosh.

23:14.832 --> 23:16.535
All right. Inspection time.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.804
Wow. You weren't lying.

23:21.839 --> 23:24.235
These do beat the hell
out of a...
out of a phone picture.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.644
-I told you.
-Thank you.

23:26.679 --> 23:27.579
You're welcome.

23:31.013 --> 23:33.651
So, Hal, I've been thinking.

23:33.686 --> 23:35.851
Uh-oh.

23:35.886 --> 23:38.183
-We both are here to write.
-Well, I don't know
if that's exactly--

23:38.218 --> 23:41.087
And I find you interesting.

23:41.122 --> 23:44.662
So I was thinking that...

23:44.697 --> 23:45.762
You know what?

23:45.797 --> 23:47.093
It'd be easier
if I just showed you.

23:47.128 --> 23:48.765
Come on. Let's go.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.866
What-- What?
There's so much good food left.

23:50.901 --> 23:52.967
There's plenty more
where that came from.

23:53.002 --> 23:54.001
All right.

23:55.972 --> 23:58.137
What's with the coaster thing?

23:58.172 --> 24:00.073
By themselves,
just flimsy cardboard,

24:00.108 --> 24:02.515
but a little chicken scratch,
they become mementos.

24:02.550 --> 24:03.879
You know it's weird, right?

24:03.914 --> 24:04.979
It's normal, right?

24:41.248 --> 24:44.183
-This is where you're staying?
-Yep.

24:44.218 --> 24:46.053
Oh, my God!

24:48.728 --> 24:50.222
I am sorry.

24:50.257 --> 24:52.763
I did not know you were
roughing it like this.

24:52.798 --> 24:54.259
-You're hilarious.
-No, I mean,

24:54.294 --> 24:56.096
I seriously would have offered
any assistance.

24:56.131 --> 24:57.966
I mean, are you okay?
Do you need me to call someone?

24:58.001 --> 25:00.166
-I'm laughing on the inside.
-Oh, here's actually--

25:00.201 --> 25:02.102
here are those euros
I offered you before.

25:02.137 --> 25:03.675
Just take them all.
I mean, you need them

25:03.710 --> 25:05.545
more than I do. You know? I--

25:13.115 --> 25:14.015
Wow.

25:18.186 --> 25:19.988
Uh...

25:20.023 --> 25:21.990
I'm speechless.

25:22.025 --> 25:24.355
How much does a place
like this go for?

25:24.390 --> 25:26.962
Sorry, inappropriate question.
None of my business.

25:26.997 --> 25:30.163
No, honestly, I have no idea.
My boyfriend's parents
bought it a few years back.

25:34.873 --> 25:36.136
Oh.

25:36.171 --> 25:37.973
I guess I forgot
to mention that.

25:38.008 --> 25:41.713
That's a pretty big thing
to forget.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.617
Look, I think
you should stay here
for the rest of your trip.

25:44.652 --> 25:46.850
Wait. What? Okay, back it up.

25:46.885 --> 25:48.720
I know it's not exactly
in Taormina,

25:48.755 --> 25:50.216
but there's so much
cool stuff here.

25:50.251 --> 25:52.284
The real non-touristy
kind of stuff.

25:52.319 --> 25:54.121
And plus, you could save money
on your hotel.

25:54.156 --> 25:56.057
There's so many things
wrong with this idea.

25:56.092 --> 25:57.795
-I don't see any problem.
-Okay.

25:57.830 --> 25:58.829
Uh, let's see. Uh,

25:58.865 --> 26:00.633
What about the boyfriend
I just found out about?

26:00.668 --> 26:01.667
-What about him?
-I don't think

26:01.702 --> 26:02.833
he'd like the idea

26:02.868 --> 26:04.329
of a strange man with you

26:04.364 --> 26:05.638
in his parents' villa.

26:05.673 --> 26:06.705
He doesn't have to know.

26:09.908 --> 26:11.677
I need to process this.

26:11.712 --> 26:13.371
Look, Hal, I don't even know
what's going on.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.208
We were supposed to go
to Switzerland together,

26:15.243 --> 26:17.309
and then we got in
this big fight,

26:17.344 --> 26:19.982
and he left and we had
a falling out.

26:20.017 --> 26:21.687
He left you quite the bail here.

26:21.722 --> 26:23.216
There's so much space here
to spread out and write,

26:23.251 --> 26:25.086
we might not even
see each other.

26:25.121 --> 26:26.351
I don't know. It doesn't seem--

26:26.386 --> 26:27.891
Can it just be what it is?

26:27.926 --> 26:30.157
Depends on exactly what it is.

26:30.192 --> 26:31.928
A writers retreat.

26:31.963 --> 26:34.832
A perfectly innocent
writers retreat.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.295
Two friends hanging out,

26:36.330 --> 26:39.133
looking for inspiration
and writing.

26:39.168 --> 26:41.399
Sounds more like you are
convincing yourself here.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.270
I like spending time with you.

26:44.305 --> 26:47.438
Do you like spending time
with me?

26:47.473 --> 26:49.308
-Yes.
-Then it's settled.

26:49.343 --> 26:50.947
Writers retreat.

26:50.982 --> 26:53.917
-You're very bossy.
-Thank you.

26:55.921 --> 26:57.822
Why do I feel like
we're gonna regret this?

27:00.761 --> 27:03.157
Ah.<i> Grazie,</i> Signori.

27:03.192 --> 27:05.390
-Beautiful.
-Arrivederci, signor Flynn.

27:05.425 --> 27:06.732
<i>Grazie.</i>

27:28.789 --> 27:30.283
Comfortable?

27:30.318 --> 27:31.988
Uh, are you kidding?

27:32.023 --> 27:33.891
I, I feel like a king.

27:33.926 --> 27:35.387
Good.

27:35.422 --> 27:37.895
Um, I'll have to show you
how to make the coffee.

27:37.930 --> 27:39.765
Here, they do it differently.
Moka pot.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.899
But other than that,
make yourself at home.

27:41.934 --> 27:44.429
Okay. Um, well, this is nuts.

27:44.464 --> 27:46.431
-Uh, but thank you.
-Of course.

27:46.466 --> 27:48.807
Wait till you see the view
we have for sunset.

27:48.842 --> 27:52.206
-It gets better than this?
-Yes.

27:52.241 --> 27:53.911
Okay.

28:06.321 --> 28:08.090
Oh, wow!

28:08.125 --> 28:09.388
Well?

28:09.423 --> 28:11.324
Uh...

28:11.359 --> 28:14.228
unbridled awe doesn't seem
to do justice.

28:14.263 --> 28:15.900
But it is the best I've got.

28:15.935 --> 28:17.869
I told you.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.971
I mean, come on, it's not real.
I mean...

28:21.006 --> 28:23.908
I expect a really good
"Poem of the day" out of this.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.008
Consider it done.

28:28.882 --> 28:31.949
So when's the last time
you talked? You and your--

28:31.984 --> 28:34.149
Capture it quick
before it disappears.

28:34.184 --> 28:35.348
Come on. Chop, chop.

28:38.188 --> 28:41.860
<i>♪ A young, single guy</i>
<i>comes to Sicily ♪</i>

28:41.895 --> 28:43.796
Who said I was single?

28:43.831 --> 28:45.963
<i>♪ Black and white photo</i>
<i>in hand ♪</i>

28:45.998 --> 28:48.229
You know, it's really hard
for me to write
with all this musical--

28:48.264 --> 28:51.562
<i>♪ A beautiful,</i>
<i>mysterious woman ♪</i>

28:51.597 --> 28:56.105
<i>♪ Is painted against the lamp ♪</i>

28:56.140 --> 28:57.975
Wow, you are nosy.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.307
Nosy Josie,
that's what they call me.

29:00.342 --> 29:03.079
All right, well, Nosy Josie,
I think it looks like

29:03.114 --> 29:06.478
we both have things we'd prefer
not to talk about.

29:09.857 --> 29:11.549
To magical sunsets!

29:11.584 --> 29:13.320
Thank you for sharing it
with me.

29:13.355 --> 29:14.552
Cheers.

30:12.546 --> 30:13.446
Hal?

30:16.319 --> 30:17.219
Hal?

30:19.993 --> 30:21.058
Hal!

30:23.194 --> 30:25.623
Hal!

30:25.658 --> 30:26.998
-Hal!
-Oh, jeez.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.231
-Oh.
-Oh, my God!

30:29.266 --> 30:30.936
Oh, I am so sorry.

30:30.971 --> 30:32.399
Oh, my God.

30:32.434 --> 30:34.940
I think you just gave me
a heart attack.

30:34.975 --> 30:37.041
Um, okay.

30:37.076 --> 30:39.912
How about a little tutorial?

30:42.675 --> 30:45.676
Okay, so don't tamp the grounds.
Let them settle.

30:45.711 --> 30:48.250
Okay. Got it.

30:48.285 --> 30:49.614
Couldn't sleep?

30:49.649 --> 30:51.583
Literally the most
comfortable bed ever

30:51.618 --> 30:54.421
and I couldn't stay still.
My mind was just racing.

30:54.456 --> 30:57.655
-Uh, anyway, so just
screw this on here?
-Mm-hmm.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.031
-Okay.
-Okay

31:00.066 --> 31:02.099
Yeah, I know the feeling.

31:02.134 --> 31:05.135
Plus, I never heard
your sunset poem.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.940
So it didn't feel
quite right to go to sleep.

31:07.975 --> 31:09.370
Uh-huh. Sure.

31:09.405 --> 31:10.470
There we go.

31:10.505 --> 31:12.373
Okay. Good.

31:12.408 --> 31:14.276
Now you're gonna let
the water gurgle.

31:14.311 --> 31:16.377
It's gonna push--
steam's gonna push the water

31:16.412 --> 31:18.313
through the grounds to the top.

31:18.348 --> 31:20.678
And voila!

31:20.713 --> 31:22.515
-Science.
-Mm-hmm.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.495
The last time we spoke
was right before he left.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.365
No calls or texts since.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.300
Nothing.

31:40.304 --> 31:41.336
Are you okay?

31:41.371 --> 31:42.403
-I mean--

31:42.438 --> 31:43.701
It's a two-way street.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.638
I haven't exactly
reached out either.

31:46.673 --> 31:48.079
What did you guys fight about?

31:50.116 --> 31:51.676
Uh, well,
he brought up marriage,

31:51.711 --> 31:54.547
which to his credit,
we've been together for a years

31:54.582 --> 31:57.088
and that's something couples
should talk about, but...

31:57.123 --> 31:58.221
But?

31:58.256 --> 31:59.585
But every time he brings it up,

31:59.620 --> 32:02.126
I get so uncomfortable
and squirmy, and

32:02.161 --> 32:04.524
then he gets mad
and here we are.

32:04.559 --> 32:07.626
To cap it off,
his last gesture before he left.

32:07.661 --> 32:10.167
He slipped this on the counter
and went to Switzerland.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.303
Oh, wow.

32:14.338 --> 32:15.238
Yeah.

32:18.507 --> 32:20.276
-Do you love him?
-Of course I love him.

32:20.311 --> 32:22.047
Okay, then why did you
get uncomfortable?

32:22.082 --> 32:25.479
If I knew the answer
to that, I...

32:25.514 --> 32:28.119
-I don't think that--
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.516
No, it's fine.

32:29.551 --> 32:30.715
It's none of my business.

32:32.719 --> 32:34.224
There's something about
- 00 a.m. that makes

32:34.259 --> 32:36.061
the hard conversations easier.

32:37.757 --> 32:40.098
What about you?

32:40.133 --> 32:41.660
-Uh--
-You know, sometimes,

32:41.695 --> 32:43.233
it's good to get everything
off your chest.

32:43.268 --> 32:44.531
Uh, I put it on paper.

32:44.566 --> 32:47.402
-But if no one ever reads it?
-Stop...

32:47.437 --> 32:49.206
...making sense. Okay?

32:53.344 --> 32:55.344
Okay. Here we go.

32:55.379 --> 32:58.083
-How did we do?

32:58.118 --> 32:59.018
-Okay.
-Okay?

33:00.780 --> 33:03.616
-You know...
-Beautiful.

33:03.651 --> 33:06.124
This makes about
a quarter of the portion

33:06.159 --> 33:09.061
of the average size
in the United States.

33:09.096 --> 33:10.491
Remember,

33:10.526 --> 33:12.592
quality over quantity.

33:16.103 --> 33:19.401
Okay, I think it's about time
for that sunset poem.

33:19.436 --> 33:21.073
Nope. That's not any good.

33:21.108 --> 33:23.405
Oh, my gosh. Quit apologizing.
Just read it.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.374
Okay,
Ms. Back to the drawing board.

33:25.409 --> 33:26.672
That's different.

33:26.707 --> 33:29.609
-How's that different?
-It's different.

33:29.644 --> 33:31.413
Following up expectations,

33:31.448 --> 33:33.547
trying to write something
that people like.

33:33.582 --> 33:35.384
Seems like a great poem to have.

33:35.419 --> 33:37.452
You know what else
is a great poem to have?

33:37.487 --> 33:39.289
Being a talented writer.

33:39.324 --> 33:41.159
Okay, let's pump the brakes
on the whole writer thing.

33:41.194 --> 33:44.558
Being a talented writer
who just has to take a leap.

33:44.593 --> 33:47.396
Okay, so we both think
the other's talented.

33:47.431 --> 33:50.531
-Now what?
-Sunset poem.

33:50.566 --> 33:54.601
You're relentless.

33:59.377 --> 34:01.179
<i>"Perhaps it's that</i>
<i>twisted lemon,</i>

34:01.214 --> 34:03.313
<i>slice of heaven,</i>
<i>meringue fluff,</i>

34:03.348 --> 34:05.744
<i>with golden crusted</i>
<i>constellation crumbs</i>

34:05.779 --> 34:07.416
<i>or sherbet rays,</i>

34:07.451 --> 34:09.880
<i>the twilight souffle, who knows?</i>

34:09.915 --> 34:11.750
<i>Or perhaps the sigh</i>
<i>of the breeze</i>

34:11.785 --> 34:13.785
<i>pickpockets secrets</i>
<i>and tucks them in the clouds</i>

34:13.820 --> 34:15.655
<i>on their fly-by.</i>

34:15.690 --> 34:18.592
<i>Perhaps it's the hoodwinked</i>
<i>clairvoyant horizon</i>

34:18.627 --> 34:22.167
<i>that knows when one day comes</i>
<i>and another one goes.</i>

34:22.202 --> 34:25.203
<i>And perhaps the sun blows</i>
<i>kisses to the moon</i>
<i>as it departs,</i>

34:25.238 --> 34:27.799
<i>they work two separate shifts</i>
<i>with one beating heart.</i>

34:27.834 --> 34:29.636
<i>Perhaps.</i>

34:29.671 --> 34:32.705
<i>Perhaps the snoring mountain</i>
<i>turns in her sleep</i>

34:32.740 --> 34:36.511
<i>to dream in peace</i>
<i>or wish upon a star</i>

34:36.546 --> 34:40.383
<i>by the hecks of your hum</i>
<i>and the strum of your guitar.</i>

34:40.418 --> 34:41.417
<i>Perhaps."</i>

34:54.366 --> 34:55.926
Ow!

34:55.961 --> 34:57.895
What do you mean "ow?"
It's a pillow!

34:57.930 --> 34:59.897
I feel like
that's the general reaction

34:59.932 --> 35:01.239
when someone throws
something at you.

35:01.274 --> 35:03.637
Get up, sleepyhead.

35:03.672 --> 35:06.409
-What time is it?
-Just after- 00.

35:08.248 --> 35:10.248
Well, good news is I had
a perfectly comfortable bed

35:10.283 --> 35:13.515
about 20 feet away,
and didn't use it.

35:13.550 --> 35:14.945
Did you sleep out here too?

35:14.980 --> 35:16.617
Nope.

35:16.652 --> 35:18.157
Hey, you ever see
<i>The Godfather?</i>

35:20.326 --> 35:21.820
Have I seen<i> The Godfather?</i>

35:21.855 --> 35:23.327
What do I look like? An idiot?

35:23.362 --> 35:24.592
Okay, put some clothes on.

35:26.299 --> 35:28.266
-Quit hitting me.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.412
What are you--

35:44.680 --> 35:46.911
Ah. I see chivalry is not dead.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.520
What are you--

35:51.555 --> 35:53.324
-Oh, come on!

36:00.366 --> 36:01.728
So a few miles up the coast,

36:01.763 --> 36:03.598
there is this little town
called Savoca.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.534
It's where they filmed
some scenes from<i> The Godfather.</i>

36:05.569 --> 36:06.997
Oh, my brother's
gonna love that.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.834
He thinks I should be
seeing the Colosseum

36:08.869 --> 36:10.803
or touring some winery
and testing them.

36:10.838 --> 36:13.674
I mean, this place
has so many gems.

36:13.709 --> 36:14.807
So you have a brother?

36:14.842 --> 36:16.248
Yeah. Older.

36:16.283 --> 36:17.711
He has a family
and all that,

36:17.746 --> 36:19.581
my little niece, Stella.

36:19.616 --> 36:21.715
We actually run
the family print shop together.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.981
Look at you opening up.
We should road trip more often.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.852
Oh, hush, don't get used to it.

36:26.887 --> 36:28.293
Hey, you know it's rumored

36:28.328 --> 36:29.921
that Shakespeare
is from Messina.

36:29.956 --> 36:31.725
Oh, I know. It's part of
the reason I'm here.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.629
I think every writer knows that.

36:34.664 --> 36:36.433
Hal, I'd like to
point something out.

36:36.468 --> 36:37.929
You just called yourself
a writer.

36:40.703 --> 36:41.735
Mm.

36:50.482 --> 36:53.978
I present to you the location
of Michael Corleone's wedding.

36:54.013 --> 36:56.013
Oh, a little slice of history.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.784
To go with our pizza.

36:57.819 --> 36:59.522
-Works by the way.
-I know.

36:59.557 --> 37:01.557
Amazing.

37:01.592 --> 37:03.394
Hey, you know,
I got to tell ya, uh,

37:03.429 --> 37:05.825
I feel like this writer's
retreat is off to a great start.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.058
We're getting tons
of writing done.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.929
Inspiration is a part
of the process.

37:10.964 --> 37:13.899
-It's always good
to change up the scenery.
-Okay. Let me ask you this.

37:13.934 --> 37:16.341
-Mm-hmm.
-Since we aren't doing
much actual writing today.

37:16.376 --> 37:17.507
I beg to differ.

37:17.542 --> 37:18.871
-You're a folk singer.
-Mm-hmm.

37:18.906 --> 37:21.775
What exactly makes
a folk song a folk song?

37:21.810 --> 37:24.646
I mean, folk is kind of
a broad term, but

37:24.681 --> 37:27.077
folk songs are
songs of the people.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.749
You can debate genre,

37:28.784 --> 37:30.388
or even instrumentation,

37:30.423 --> 37:32.720
but I think a good folk song
tells a story.

37:32.755 --> 37:34.755
-Hmm. I like that.
-Mm-hmm.

37:36.660 --> 37:38.561
My turn.

37:38.596 --> 37:40.431
-For what?
-To ask a question.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.026
Oh, boy.

37:42.061 --> 37:44.061
The relationship is so lopsided.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.063
I don't know anything about you.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.340
That's not a question.

37:48.375 --> 37:50.507
Hal, I'm just-- I'm curious.

37:50.542 --> 37:53.807
Hey, listen, I told you
my whole life story
on the drive up here.

37:53.842 --> 37:56.040
You told me that
you had a brother.

37:56.075 --> 37:58.075
That barely scratches
the surface.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.946
-You are so demanding.
-Why are you in Taormina?

38:00.981 --> 38:04.114
Well, uh, we're not actually
in Taormina right now, so--

38:04.149 --> 38:06.050
-Why do you have to be
so difficult?

38:08.989 --> 38:12.463
Okay, you're right. But...

38:12.498 --> 38:14.927
-two stipulations. Okay?
-Okay.

38:14.962 --> 38:16.797
One.

38:16.832 --> 38:18.799
If I tell you, you have to
promise me something.

38:18.834 --> 38:19.899
-Okay.
-No, like promise.

38:19.934 --> 38:21.835
Okay, I promise. No

38:21.870 --> 38:24.772
sympathy at all. None.
Got it?

38:24.807 --> 38:26.543
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:26.578 --> 38:29.073
And two, since
we are in front of

38:29.108 --> 38:32.142
<i>The Godfather</i> landmark,
it only makes sense...

38:32.177 --> 38:34.452
that I get to do it
in my perfect Brando impression

38:34.487 --> 38:36.014
-that I know you
just love so much.
-No.

38:36.049 --> 38:38.555
-Nope. Absolutely not.
-Yep. It's the only way.

38:38.590 --> 38:39.490
No.

38:42.055 --> 38:44.726
Okay, fine.

38:44.761 --> 38:46.563
Well, that's--

38:50.932 --> 38:52.569
So...

38:52.604 --> 38:54.703
you may remember the woman
in the photograph.

38:54.738 --> 38:56.870
Right? The one you
helped me recreate?

38:56.905 --> 39:00.577
Well, you probably guessed it.
I mean, that's my mother.

39:00.612 --> 39:02.106
Right? And, uh...

39:02.141 --> 39:04.845
about two weeks ago,

39:04.880 --> 39:07.815
she died of cancer.

39:07.850 --> 39:09.454
And everybody who knew her said

39:09.489 --> 39:11.016
she was just made
of light, you know?

39:11.051 --> 39:12.952
I mean, she always had
the smile a mile wide

39:12.987 --> 39:16.923
and she was known
to just live for her children.

39:19.224 --> 39:22.434
She was the only one...

39:22.469 --> 39:25.162
that really gave me confidence,
especially in this stuff.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.900
Right? And, um...

39:29.234 --> 39:32.906
Anyway, so, she left us all
a bit of money, and...

39:32.941 --> 39:35.975
for me, she told me to do
something special,

39:36.010 --> 39:37.944
you know?
Something real meaningful.

39:37.979 --> 39:39.781
And that's a big pill
to swallow.

39:39.816 --> 39:41.717
So I...

39:41.752 --> 39:43.752
decided to come to her
favorite place in the world

39:43.787 --> 39:48.724
to figure out how best
to honor her legacy.

39:48.759 --> 39:50.561
And it's the first time
I've ever had any money.

39:50.596 --> 39:53.861
I didn't know what to do
with it, so...

39:53.896 --> 39:56.699
I figured I'd try to find
the answer here, you know?

39:59.099 --> 39:59.999
Sorry.

40:02.102 --> 40:04.168
-I am so sorry.
-No. No sympathy,

40:04.203 --> 40:06.643
-you promised.
-How will I not--

40:06.678 --> 40:10.779
I think my Brando
slipped into Mike Tyson
at the beginning there.

40:10.814 --> 40:12.484
How's your dad handling it?

40:12.519 --> 40:14.519
Well, depending on
what you believe,

40:14.554 --> 40:16.851
they've been reunited
as it were.

40:16.886 --> 40:18.655
So my brother and I,
we're orphans now.

40:21.594 --> 40:23.594
Wow. That's my first time
saying that out loud.

46:09.370 --> 46:11.271
<i>-Molto grazie.</i>
<i>-Prego.</i>

46:11.306 --> 46:12.976
Look at you speaking
in Italian in style.

46:13.011 --> 46:15.473
Oh, yeah, very impressive.
Practically fluent.

46:18.610 --> 46:19.983
-Mm-hmm. Yes.
-Both of you?

46:20.018 --> 46:21.116
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

46:24.253 --> 46:28.354
Uh, sorry. You make
a beautiful couple.

46:28.389 --> 46:30.290
<i>Grazie.</i> We're actually
on our honeymoon.

46:30.325 --> 46:31.357
What? No?

46:31.392 --> 46:34.965
No, no, no. No.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.593
No, no. Uh, friends.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.496
-Uh, Amici.
-Yeah, amici.

46:38.531 --> 46:40.465
-What no say--
-Yeah, she actually,

46:40.500 --> 46:42.874
uh, she kidnapped me
and took me to her villa.

46:42.909 --> 46:44.205
It's kind of like
<i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

46:44.240 --> 46:48.044
-I did not. He is crazy.

46:48.079 --> 46:51.179
Guys, there is such a,
you know,

46:51.214 --> 46:53.379
peace between you.

46:53.414 --> 46:56.514
You seem like friends to have
spent many years together.

46:56.549 --> 46:58.890
-We actually just met.
-Just a few days ago.

46:58.925 --> 47:01.222
No. First time here in Sicily?

47:01.257 --> 47:03.587
Uh, first time
leaving the States.

47:03.622 --> 47:06.128
Hal here, he's a pretty
impressive guy.

47:06.163 --> 47:08.966
He came all the way from-- Wait.

47:09.001 --> 47:11.430
-Where are you from?
-Okay, Iowa.

47:11.465 --> 47:13.234
Look at that.
Practically neighbors.

47:13.269 --> 47:15.434
Um, he came all the way
to Sicily

47:15.469 --> 47:17.535
from Iowa for inspiration.

47:17.570 --> 47:19.504
Um,<i> inspiracion?</i>

47:19.539 --> 47:22.210
Well, you seem
to have found it.

47:22.245 --> 47:24.014
Oh.

47:24.049 --> 47:26.445
Tony, here.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.184
We have a phrase for this.

47:29.219 --> 47:31.648
What you are doing.

47:31.683 --> 47:34.354
A leap of faith,
<i>salto mortale.</i>

47:34.389 --> 47:37.093
A leap of faith,
so they're artists.

47:37.128 --> 47:40.657
Ah, okay, I don't know if
that's the case with me.

47:40.692 --> 47:42.164
But she's the one.

47:42.199 --> 47:43.495
I mean, she's the one
who writes songs

47:43.530 --> 47:45.068
and then shares them
with the world.

47:45.103 --> 47:46.663
If anyone's brave,
it's definitely her.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.302
Mm. I think I am just lucky.

47:48.337 --> 47:51.140
Oh, let me go
to cook something

47:51.175 --> 47:54.011
for this nice couple.
They look hungry.

47:54.046 --> 47:55.375
<i>-Grazie.</i>
-Thank you.

47:58.182 --> 48:00.413
-Uh, my father. Sorry.

48:00.448 --> 48:02.382
It's okay.

48:02.417 --> 48:05.286
How about this? Simple.

48:05.321 --> 48:07.519
There is much beauty
in what you do.

48:07.554 --> 48:09.323
Both of you.

48:11.525 --> 48:13.294
<i>-Grazie.</i>

48:16.662 --> 48:18.970
Oh, hon, don't forget.
We need to get one of those

48:19.005 --> 48:20.697
bottles of wine for your mom
before we go back.

48:20.732 --> 48:22.974
-Shut up.
It's your favorite.

48:23.009 --> 48:25.339
-We both know that.

fully honest or-- that might
not even be the right word.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.048
Wow, wow, look. I am an idiot

49:37.083 --> 49:39.380
when it comes to music,
but I know what I like.

49:39.415 --> 49:41.217
-You're biased.
-Who cares?

49:41.252 --> 49:42.548
I care. Do you know
how hard it is

49:42.583 --> 49:44.451
for musicians to write
a second record?

49:44.486 --> 49:46.090
Uh, no idea.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.784
But I'd, I'd like to think that,

49:47.819 --> 49:49.423
you know, maybe it has
something to do with them

49:49.458 --> 49:50.754
being too scared to follow up

49:50.789 --> 49:52.228
with something successful.

49:52.263 --> 49:53.658
Well, maybe it's
because they forgot

49:53.693 --> 49:55.165
why they even
started in the first place.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.496
Or what people connect with.

49:56.531 --> 49:57.827
I don't know. That just--

49:57.862 --> 49:59.829
that seems like
a recipe for misery.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.732
I'm gallivanting around Sicily,

50:01.767 --> 50:04.702
staying in this luxurious villa
and wasting time,

50:04.737 --> 50:06.209
who can relate to that?

50:06.244 --> 50:07.639
Hey, don't knock this villa.

50:07.674 --> 50:09.146
Someone once told me it's a
perfect place

50:09.181 --> 50:10.378
for a writer's retreat.

50:10.413 --> 50:11.742
Shut up.

50:11.777 --> 50:13.315
No, but I mean, come on,
all right. Let's--

50:13.350 --> 50:14.712
Let's go back a little bit.

50:14.747 --> 50:16.384
There's a--
there's a great quote, okay?

50:16.419 --> 50:18.452
Um, "Comparison is
the death of joy."

50:18.487 --> 50:19.585
-Mm-hmm.
-Right?

50:19.620 --> 50:20.850
So you gotta stop being so hard

50:20.885 --> 50:22.555
on yourself and comparing

50:22.590 --> 50:24.194
everything you do
to loving right.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.691
I mean, it's legitimately
a tiny fraction

50:26.726 --> 50:29.100
of what's going to be
a gargantuan career.

50:29.135 --> 50:30.530
-I don't know.
-I do.

50:30.565 --> 50:32.268
It's easy for you to say, Hal.

50:32.303 --> 50:34.600
Everything is so effortless
in that notebook.

50:34.635 --> 50:37.768
And then you're totally fine
with just keeping it
all to yourself.

50:37.803 --> 50:39.374
There's nothing wrong
with being unknown.

50:39.409 --> 50:41.079
But there is something wrong
with not trying.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.380
Writing makes me happy.

50:45.415 --> 50:47.415
If nobody reads it...

50:47.450 --> 50:49.351
Uh...

50:49.386 --> 50:52.387
Who said that?
Comparison is the death of joy.

50:52.422 --> 50:55.654
Probably Abe Lincoln
or Mark Twain.

50:55.689 --> 50:57.194
Did you fact-check that?

50:57.229 --> 50:59.295
I don't know.

50:59.330 --> 51:01.462
According to the internet,
they said everything.

51:09.472 --> 51:11.736
Ever stood on an active volcano?

51:11.771 --> 51:14.673
Nope. This would be
a first for me.

51:14.708 --> 51:16.411
Are you scared? Oh.

51:16.446 --> 51:18.578
-No, more impressed.

51:18.613 --> 51:20.481
I mean, isn't it crazy
to imagine the amount

51:20.516 --> 51:22.318
of destruction that thing
can cause?

51:22.353 --> 51:24.716
But it's just
sitting there, peacefully,

51:24.751 --> 51:27.818
biding its time
and growing wine.

51:27.853 --> 51:29.589
You know, if you look
over there,

51:29.624 --> 51:32.295
you can see the spot where
we had the perfect view

51:32.330 --> 51:33.857
of Etna. And now we're here.

51:33.892 --> 51:35.364
-It's weird how that works.
-Yeah.

51:35.399 --> 51:37.399
It's also weird that--
I keep thinking,

51:37.434 --> 51:38.829
weren't we supposed
to get bored today

51:38.864 --> 51:40.402
to get some
actual writing done?

51:40.437 --> 51:41.865
Mm. It's what I'm doing.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.438
How can you get bored
with all this around?

51:43.473 --> 51:44.637
I mean, you shout have
stayed in Minnesota

51:44.672 --> 51:45.869
or come visited me in Iowa.

51:45.904 --> 51:47.607
You'd definitely get bore there.

51:47.642 --> 51:49.840
-Did your parents
live there too? In Iowa?
-Mm.

51:52.383 --> 51:54.218
Did you get to spend time
with your mom

51:54.253 --> 51:56.187
before she passed?

51:56.222 --> 51:57.947
Whoa, look at that.
You see that?

51:57.982 --> 51:59.652
-What?
-That's the mood.

51:59.687 --> 52:02.391
It just died
'cause you killed it.

52:02.426 --> 52:06.329
Okay, Mr. Destructive Volcano.

52:06.364 --> 52:08.595
Yeah, I sat with her every day.

52:08.630 --> 52:09.860
Good talks?

52:09.895 --> 52:12.401
Sometimes.
Sometimes we'd just...

52:12.436 --> 52:14.898
sit in silence and...

52:14.933 --> 52:17.274
actually, I read her
a poem every day.

52:18.838 --> 52:21.245
We never had that
all revealing talk

52:21.280 --> 52:24.908
where she imparts
her wisdom on how to carry on
without her, but

52:24.943 --> 52:27.911
I will never forget the way
her hands looked.

52:27.946 --> 52:28.978
Mm.

52:29.013 --> 52:30.980
I can't imagine losing a parent.

52:31.015 --> 52:33.422
-Let alone both.
-Yeah.

52:33.457 --> 52:35.622
That's what I thought too,
but if there is any

52:35.657 --> 52:37.393
glimmer of positive thing,

52:37.428 --> 52:39.362
it's actually when I walked
into the funeral hall

52:39.397 --> 52:41.694
when I realized that...

52:41.729 --> 52:43.597
it brings us together as people.

52:43.632 --> 52:46.237
You know, all the petty stuff
goes out the window because

52:46.272 --> 52:48.899
we all lose loved ones. Um...

52:48.934 --> 52:52.309
we all face our own mortality.

52:52.344 --> 52:54.839
It kind of snapped life
into focus for a second.

52:56.744 --> 52:58.645
I just wish they...

52:58.680 --> 53:00.911
could've seen
their grandchildren
grow up, you know.

53:03.289 --> 53:07.588
We all want more time.
We don't appreciate
what we get, so it's...

53:07.623 --> 53:09.722
Wow, I'm so sorry
I dragged on there.

53:09.757 --> 53:12.560
Um, I'm sorry.

53:12.595 --> 53:14.760
You lose someone
close to you?

53:14.795 --> 53:16.696
Yeah. My grandpa.

53:16.731 --> 53:18.533
He was pretty magical.

53:18.568 --> 53:22.306
World traveler,
always curious and...

53:22.341 --> 53:24.539
he had this spark that, like,
not most people have.

53:26.477 --> 53:28.279
You kinda have it.

53:28.314 --> 53:30.809
Oh, I have a spark?
What does it look like?

53:30.844 --> 53:33.042
Shut up. It was a compliment.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.615
Jerk.

53:34.650 --> 53:35.715
No, seriously, though,

53:35.750 --> 53:36.947
he sounds like an amazing man.

53:36.982 --> 53:38.586
He was. Definitely something

53:38.621 --> 53:39.785
to aspire to, for sure.

54:19.464 --> 54:21.365
Hey, Josie. Um...

54:21.400 --> 54:22.762
Can you come out here,
I have an important question

54:22.797 --> 54:24.797
for you, please?

54:24.832 --> 54:26.370
About something I found.

54:29.573 --> 54:31.936
Yeah. I need you
to clear something up
for me really quick.

54:31.971 --> 54:36.479
What exactly makes
a love song...

54:36.514 --> 54:38.745
-obscure?
-No, no, no, no.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.516
-Put that down.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

54:40.551 --> 54:42.045
Oh, no, no, no.
We're definitely playing it.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.849
Oh, my gosh. It was
confusing times in college.

54:43.884 --> 54:45.521
Don't you play that.

54:45.556 --> 54:46.852
You know, this is amazing.

54:46.887 --> 54:48.656
Don't you dare
apologize for this.

54:48.691 --> 54:50.658
-My gosh.
-Uh-huh.

54:50.693 --> 54:52.792
And by the way, you look--

54:52.827 --> 54:53.760
What's the occasion?

54:53.795 --> 54:54.959
No, I just felt

54:54.994 --> 54:56.400
like dressing up.

54:56.435 --> 54:57.896
-Is that okay with you?
-Yeah.

54:57.931 --> 54:59.436
It's definitely okay.

54:59.471 --> 55:01.064
But I feel like
a lonely peasant.

55:01.099 --> 55:03.572
Well, it's our last night
to go out.

55:03.607 --> 55:04.870
I thought we had
tomorrow night.

55:04.905 --> 55:07.070
You have an early flight
the next morning.

55:10.108 --> 55:11.646
Well, I'll go get ready then.

55:11.681 --> 55:13.549
Until then, exclusive.

55:13.584 --> 55:17.619
<i>♪ Good night, my ladies ♪</i>

55:17.654 --> 55:20.523

55:39.973 --> 55:41.379
Why, thank you.

55:43.009 --> 55:45.108
We're gonna dance to it.
Absolutely.

55:45.143 --> 55:47.451
There you go. There you go.

55:47.486 --> 55:50.652
-That right.
-Uh-huh.

55:50.687 --> 55:51.950
Very nice.

55:51.985 --> 55:53.589
Not too shabby.

55:57.628 --> 56:00.189
You do look beautiful.

56:00.224 --> 56:04.633
You also look beautiful.

56:04.668 --> 56:06.767
I do declare.

56:06.802 --> 56:09.506
-Okay. Let's go.

56:46.039 --> 56:47.841
We try so hard as musicians

56:47.876 --> 56:49.744
to put something good
into the world,

56:49.779 --> 56:51.548
and this is what people like.

56:51.583 --> 56:54.144
I can't believe Dean's brother
said he likes this place.

56:54.179 --> 56:55.486
You want to go somewhere else?

56:55.521 --> 56:57.587
Oh, no, no. It's fine.

56:57.622 --> 56:59.182
I am just being
a cranky old lady.

56:59.217 --> 57:00.854
Okay. How about this?
We do one drink

57:00.889 --> 57:02.592
-and then we'll leave.
-Okay.

57:02.627 --> 57:04.726
What drink do old ladies
drink around in these bars?

57:04.761 --> 57:06.860
Um, Camapri, neat.

57:06.895 --> 57:08.862
Okay, I'll make that two.

57:43.129 --> 57:46.097
Hey, Jo, this is Elizabeth
and Kenny.

57:46.132 --> 57:48.099
They're studying abroad in...

57:48.134 --> 57:49.540
-Florence.
-...Florence.

57:49.575 --> 57:50.970
And they heard about Taormina

57:51.005 --> 57:52.840
and wanted to come here
for the weekend.

57:52.875 --> 57:54.545
Art history majors.

57:54.580 --> 57:57.306
Yeah, they-- This is Josie Day,

57:57.341 --> 57:59.682
the famous musician.

57:59.717 --> 58:01.046
Oh!

58:01.081 --> 58:03.587
Oh, my God, no way.

58:03.622 --> 58:06.590
Hi. Josie, uh, not famous.

58:06.625 --> 58:09.219
Oh, Elizabeth. Like he said.

58:09.254 --> 58:11.221
-And you're Kenny, right?
-Yeah.

58:11.256 --> 58:13.597
You're sure it's okay
that we're with you?

58:13.632 --> 58:15.258
We're not interrupting
date night?

58:15.293 --> 58:16.963
Oh, no, you're totally fine.

58:16.998 --> 58:18.833
Okay.

58:18.868 --> 58:21.638
-So, Josie, what do you play?
-Uh, folk.

58:21.673 --> 58:23.640
Oh, also like country.

58:23.675 --> 58:27.171
Uh, no. Like Dylan.

58:27.206 --> 58:30.339
Cool! Cool!

58:30.374 --> 58:31.912
Yeah.

58:31.947 --> 58:34.079
You know, could I just say
it's so nice

58:34.114 --> 58:36.752
to run into some
fellow Americans here.

58:36.787 --> 58:38.919
Yeah, not too many
this time of year.

58:42.155 --> 58:43.187
Shots!

58:43.222 --> 58:44.694
Let's do shots.

58:44.729 --> 58:46.861
Shots?

58:49.800 --> 58:52.262
You know, like the best part
about living in Europe

58:52.297 --> 58:56.739
is that you can fly, like,
anywhere for dirt cheap.

58:56.774 --> 58:59.940
And, like, see all these
beautiful, hidden little gems.

58:59.975 --> 59:02.272
Yeah, this is
my first time overseas.

59:02.307 --> 59:03.647
Shut up. No way!

59:03.682 --> 59:04.978
Way.

59:05.013 --> 59:06.309
So this is, like, the--

59:06.344 --> 59:08.080
the only place
you've been in Europe?

59:08.115 --> 59:10.313
Yeah, he just said that.

59:10.348 --> 59:11.655
Guilty.

59:11.690 --> 59:14.625
Oh, my God, that is so cute!

59:14.660 --> 59:18.354
Okay, well,
you have to at least visit us
in Florence, right, Kenny?

59:18.389 --> 59:20.290
-Right, Kenny?
-Totally.

59:22.701 --> 59:24.096
What about you, Josie?

59:24.131 --> 59:25.900
I've been to a few places.

59:25.935 --> 59:27.671
What's been your favorite?

59:27.706 --> 59:30.003
I mean, honestly, as beautiful
as it is over here,

59:30.038 --> 59:31.972
one of my favorite places
to go--

59:32.007 --> 59:35.041
Oh, my God! I love this song.

59:35.076 --> 59:38.715
Come on, Hal.
Join me for a dance?

59:38.750 --> 59:41.080
Come on. You look like
you can dance.

59:41.115 --> 59:42.213
-Let's go.
-Okay.

59:42.248 --> 59:43.753
Come on.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.423
So you were saying?

59:54.458 --> 59:58.229
Uh, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
Never mind.

1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:08.877
So I take it you two
aren't together then?

1:00:08.912 --> 1:00:12.243
No. She's hot
but we're just friends.

1:00:12.278 --> 1:00:13.717
Cool.

1:00:17.789 --> 1:00:19.756
Kenny, it's been
an absolute pleasure,

1:00:19.791 --> 1:00:21.186
but I think I'm gonna go.

1:00:27.799 --> 1:00:29.293
Do you want me
to walk you home?

1:00:29.328 --> 1:00:31.999
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1:00:32.034 --> 1:00:33.099
Cool.

1:01:03.395 --> 1:01:06.231
<i>Hey, it's Dean.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:13.843
Hey, Kenny.

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:17.044
Did, uh-- did Josie
go to the bathroom or what?

1:01:17.079 --> 1:01:19.849
Uh, unless the bathroom
is out the front door,

1:01:19.884 --> 1:01:20.982
I don't think so.

1:01:21.017 --> 1:01:22.181
Oh, shit.

1:01:22.216 --> 1:01:23.787
Oh, I should go.

1:01:23.822 --> 1:01:26.284
What? No. Come on,
we're having so much fun!

1:01:26.319 --> 1:01:28.451
No, I can't, I can't, I can't.

1:01:28.486 --> 1:01:31.993
All right, all right.
Well, just give me your phone.

1:01:32.028 --> 1:01:34.325
-Huh?
-I said give me your phone.

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.767
Oh.

1:01:36.802 --> 1:01:38.362
-There you go.
-Thank you.

1:01:42.874 --> 1:01:45.402
Text me sometime
about Florence.

1:01:45.437 --> 1:01:46.843
Okay.

1:02:30.856 --> 1:02:33.252
I didn't think you were coming.

1:02:33.287 --> 1:02:35.551
I know.

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:36.486
Sorry.

1:03:36.350 --> 1:03:37.514
Jose?

1:04:34.276 --> 1:04:36.672
Excuse me,<i> Signorina,</i>

1:04:36.707 --> 1:04:38.377
I hate to presume,

1:04:38.412 --> 1:04:41.644
but you seem like someone
who appreciates poetry.

1:04:41.679 --> 1:04:44.515
Mind if I share
a little something
that I concocted?

1:04:44.550 --> 1:04:48.024
Does it describe in detail
what Elizabeth's, uh,

1:04:48.059 --> 1:04:50.125
tongue felt like
down your throat or--?

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:52.556
No, that would be
tomorrow's poem.

1:04:52.591 --> 1:04:53.458
Oh, yes.

1:04:55.264 --> 1:04:58.166
If you don't mind,
it's more a poem of the week.

1:04:58.201 --> 1:04:59.662
I guess I'll let that slide.

1:05:02.634 --> 1:05:04.403
It's called "Jokers."

1:05:06.572 --> 1:05:09.045
"I think time and space
are privy

1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:10.739
to the same inside joke
that fate

1:05:10.774 --> 1:05:12.675
has been telling for years.

1:05:12.710 --> 1:05:15.678
The punchline usually
involves my constant clear miss,

1:05:15.713 --> 1:05:18.516
or a wrong-call coin toss.

1:05:18.551 --> 1:05:21.354
It's on this little island
that they finally agree.

1:05:21.389 --> 1:05:22.718
Let's be kind for once,

1:05:22.753 --> 1:05:24.621
leave it up to the boy.

1:05:24.656 --> 1:05:26.260
Let's give it to him.

1:05:26.295 --> 1:05:28.625
Give him the melody
that summons the sea,

1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:30.066
or else he'll walk
a different path

1:05:30.101 --> 1:05:32.629
and so, so shall she.

1:05:32.664 --> 1:05:35.170
Give them the hours
times breath

1:05:35.205 --> 1:05:38.536
and cobblestone magic,
fate's embrace.

1:05:38.571 --> 1:05:40.472
Teach them<i> salto mortale,</i>

1:05:40.507 --> 1:05:41.407
that leap of faith."

1:05:44.082 --> 1:05:46.610
Okay, that was actually
pretty sweet.

1:05:46.645 --> 1:05:48.678
But I didn't ask
for you to come find me.

1:05:48.713 --> 1:05:51.186
Hey, you left a note.
Anyone who leaves a note
wants to be found.

1:05:51.221 --> 1:05:53.188
I'm trying to get bored.

1:05:53.223 --> 1:05:55.157
Okay, look,

1:05:55.192 --> 1:05:57.159
I get that you're upset.

1:05:57.194 --> 1:05:58.457
I'm not upset.

1:05:58.492 --> 1:06:00.129
There's nothing
to be upset about.

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:02.098
Okay.

1:06:02.133 --> 1:06:04.067
Well,

1:06:04.102 --> 1:06:05.596
can we at least address
the obnoxiously

1:06:05.631 --> 1:06:07.202
large elephant in the room?

1:06:07.237 --> 1:06:09.072
We're not technically
in a room,

1:06:09.107 --> 1:06:11.305
we're actually in
an ancient garden.

1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:14.044
Okay, that's a very new way
of dodging things,

1:06:14.079 --> 1:06:16.112
but it's my last day
and I'm trying to apologize.

1:06:16.147 --> 1:06:18.543
I don't want things to be weird.

1:06:18.578 --> 1:06:20.347
What's the elephant in the room?

1:06:22.285 --> 1:06:24.681
The elephant,
let's call him Gustav,

1:06:24.716 --> 1:06:28.619
is that you're pissed
I hooked up with someone,

1:06:28.654 --> 1:06:31.589
which leads me
to believe that maybe,

1:06:31.624 --> 1:06:33.723
just maybe you share
the same feelings about me

1:06:33.758 --> 1:06:35.329
that I do about you.

1:06:37.102 --> 1:06:39.366
Okay, look.
Elizabeth may be tiny,

1:06:39.401 --> 1:06:40.664
but she packs a hell
of a punch.

1:06:40.699 --> 1:06:42.204
I mean, very forceful.

1:06:42.239 --> 1:06:44.140
No. No impersonations,
no grunts,

1:06:44.175 --> 1:06:46.802
no whatever it is you always do
to keep things light.

1:06:46.837 --> 1:06:48.375
Did you ever think for a minute

1:06:48.410 --> 1:06:51.081
that maybe that's not what
I'm upset about.

1:06:51.116 --> 1:06:53.116
Maybe I'm upset that
you have all this talent

1:06:53.151 --> 1:06:55.613
and you're gonna go back working
at a print shop in Iowa.

1:06:55.648 --> 1:06:57.483
Oh, okay, I have to pay
the bills, Jose.

1:06:57.518 --> 1:06:59.485
Plus, it's not like I'm just
gonna stop writing.

1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:02.323
What are you gonna do with
the rest of your mom's gift?

1:07:02.358 --> 1:07:04.556
I don't know. I'm still
figuring that out.

1:07:04.591 --> 1:07:07.295
Oh, my God, Hal,
it is so obvious.

1:07:09.893 --> 1:07:12.102
Take the money
to have time off,

1:07:12.137 --> 1:07:14.170
to invest in yourself,
to write a book.

1:07:14.205 --> 1:07:15.732
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

1:07:15.767 --> 1:07:18.075
Because it would be a waste
of her gift. Okay?

1:07:20.904 --> 1:07:22.277
Where are you going?

1:07:22.312 --> 1:07:23.575
You're too chickenshit

1:07:23.610 --> 1:07:25.148
to believe in yourself
and I was wrong.

1:07:25.183 --> 1:07:26.578
What-- About what?

1:07:26.613 --> 1:07:28.316
About you.

1:07:28.351 --> 1:07:30.450
Okay, hold on.
This coming from someone

1:07:30.485 --> 1:07:33.123
who's afraid to write a new song
because, what, she has one song

1:07:33.158 --> 1:07:35.323
that people like already?
It's a blip in your career.

1:07:35.358 --> 1:07:37.424
It's not like
you're trying to follow up
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

1:07:37.459 --> 1:07:39.690
At least I try, Hal.

1:07:39.725 --> 1:07:42.891
You're totally content
with never putting yourself
out into the world.

1:07:42.926 --> 1:07:44.530
And living under this guise

1:07:44.565 --> 1:07:46.400
of being some
"undiscovered" talent.

1:07:46.435 --> 1:07:48.567
Okay, maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm okay with that.

1:07:48.602 --> 1:07:51.603
But at least I confront
the real problems of my life.

1:07:51.638 --> 1:07:53.539
What is that supposed to mean?

1:07:53.574 --> 1:07:55.244
You're still with some guy

1:07:55.279 --> 1:07:57.312
who left on a work trip
to Switzerland

1:07:57.347 --> 1:07:58.907
after an epic argument,

1:07:58.942 --> 1:08:00.843
who you don't really
want to marry. I mean, come on,

1:08:00.878 --> 1:08:02.416
we, we have a phrase for this.

1:08:02.451 --> 1:08:03.747
It's called prolonging
the inevitable.

1:08:03.782 --> 1:08:06.156
-It is not that simple.
-It is.

1:08:06.191 --> 1:08:09.489
Leave him or be with him.
Pick one.

1:08:09.524 --> 1:08:12.162
You're just-- Okay, listen,
you're just stuck in this warp.

1:08:12.197 --> 1:08:13.493
Okay, this no man's land

1:08:13.528 --> 1:08:14.857
and you can easily
get out of it

1:08:14.892 --> 1:08:16.793
if you just make a decision.

1:08:16.828 --> 1:08:19.631
Here's a decision.
Pack your things
and go back to the hotel.

1:08:19.666 --> 1:08:21.402
This is too muddy.

1:08:21.437 --> 1:08:23.602
-But it's my last night.
-I know.

1:08:27.245 --> 1:08:29.212
You know what the worst part
about all this is?

1:08:29.247 --> 1:08:31.280
I can tell just by
the look on your face,

1:08:31.315 --> 1:08:32.644
you don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

1:09:36.809 --> 1:09:38.611
I'll...

1:09:38.646 --> 1:09:40.481
I'll, uh, I'll keep my ears open

1:09:40.516 --> 1:09:41.878
for that next hit song.

1:09:45.884 --> 1:09:47.917
You're not gonna need it,
but in case you need

1:09:47.952 --> 1:09:49.226
any concert apparel or...

1:09:58.028 --> 1:09:58.928
Well--

1:10:04.606 --> 1:10:05.506
Yeah.

1:10:10.678 --> 1:10:12.513
-Shit.
-What?

1:10:12.548 --> 1:10:14.614
-He's back early.
-Who, your boyfriend?

1:10:14.649 --> 1:10:16.451
-Obviously.
-Told you this was
a bad idea.

1:10:16.486 --> 1:10:18.816
-You have to go.
-No shit.

1:10:18.851 --> 1:10:20.521
You have to hide now!

1:10:20.556 --> 1:10:21.819
I'm not James Bond.
What are you--

1:10:21.854 --> 1:10:23.854
I don't care
who you are, just go!

1:10:23.889 --> 1:10:26.054
-Damn it.
-Go!

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:27.330
-Oh, shit.
-Go!

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:36.405
You scared me.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.308
I caught the early flight home.

1:10:38.343 --> 1:10:40.871
I can see that.

1:10:40.906 --> 1:10:44.479
Uh, I tried calling.

1:10:44.514 --> 1:10:45.546
I know.

1:10:47.550 --> 1:10:50.980
Do you want me to help you
with your bag?

1:10:51.015 --> 1:10:53.048
No, it's okay. Thanks.

1:11:09.407 --> 1:11:11.539
-Go.
-Where?

1:11:11.574 --> 1:11:14.542
This way!

1:11:14.577 --> 1:11:16.071
Quietly.

1:11:20.682 --> 1:11:21.714
Will I see you again?

1:11:21.749 --> 1:11:23.485
I don't know. Just go.

Don't you think we need
to talk about this?

1:12:43.567 --> 1:12:46.128

Here's to your last night
in Italy.

1:13:47.862 --> 1:13:51.061
-Thanks for joining me.
-Of course.

1:13:51.096 --> 1:13:53.261
Okay, so I still don't know
anything about you.

1:13:53.296 --> 1:13:55.637
-Art history major.
-Right.

1:13:55.672 --> 1:13:58.200
Well, truth be told,
I didn't exactly know

1:13:58.235 --> 1:13:59.740
what I wanted to major in,

1:13:59.775 --> 1:14:02.237
so I just kind of picked one.

1:14:02.272 --> 1:14:04.613
Okay. And you get
to come to Italy

1:14:04.648 --> 1:14:06.714
-and immerse yourself
in the culture.
-Mm.

1:14:06.749 --> 1:14:09.013
And the wine.

1:14:09.048 --> 1:14:12.753
Don't you just love
the architecture here? It's...

1:14:12.788 --> 1:14:14.590
a perfect blend of old and new.

1:14:14.625 --> 1:14:15.954
Mm, mm. Yeah, like,

1:14:15.989 --> 1:14:18.220
like the imprint of history.

1:14:18.255 --> 1:14:19.925
I mean, isn't that what art
is all about?

1:14:23.601 --> 1:14:25.898
And, you know, it looks cool.

1:14:27.902 --> 1:14:30.804
Hey, uh, would you mind holding
down the fort for a minute?

1:14:30.839 --> 1:14:32.201
Aye, aye, captain.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.788
Hey, Jose.

1:14:47.823 --> 1:14:49.955
Uh, I'm sorry I missed
your call. Uh...

1:14:51.893 --> 1:14:54.289
I don't know if you got
all my texts or...

1:14:57.162 --> 1:14:59.096
I don't know, maybe--
Maybe I'll see ya.

1:15:16.247 --> 1:15:18.148
-Well, welcome back.
-Mm.

1:15:18.183 --> 1:15:20.348
-Sorry that took so long.
-That's all right.

1:15:20.383 --> 1:15:22.350
-Where were we?

1:15:22.385 --> 1:15:24.990
I mean, tell me about yourself.
Will you?

1:15:29.359 --> 1:15:32.734
Uh, shit. Uh...

1:15:32.769 --> 1:15:34.098
-Uh--
-Is everything okay?

1:15:34.133 --> 1:15:36.573
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be
right back. Sorry.

1:15:39.842 --> 1:15:40.940
Okay.

1:15:45.210 --> 1:15:46.781
Josie!

1:15:46.816 --> 1:15:48.112
Hey, Josie.

1:15:48.147 --> 1:15:50.180
-Hey.
-Sorry I missed your call.

1:15:50.215 --> 1:15:51.346
How's Elizabeth?

1:15:51.381 --> 1:15:52.985
Okay, that's--

1:15:53.020 --> 1:15:54.855
-You worked fast.
-I just wanted

1:15:54.890 --> 1:15:56.956
some company
for tonight, that's all.

1:15:56.991 --> 1:15:59.024
I just felt like we left things
on a bad note

1:15:59.059 --> 1:16:00.993
and I think we both said
things we didn't mean.

1:16:01.028 --> 1:16:03.699
Oh, no, I think we both said
exactly what we meant.

1:16:03.734 --> 1:16:06.328
And that's why it sucks
so much to hear.

1:16:06.363 --> 1:16:09.067
I can't just forget about
a three-year relationship.

1:16:09.102 --> 1:16:10.739
I'm not saying you should.

1:16:10.774 --> 1:16:12.400
It was a perfectly
innocent writers' retreat.

1:16:12.435 --> 1:16:14.710
Just two friends
bouncing ideas off each other,

1:16:14.745 --> 1:16:17.141
writing. Your words.

1:16:17.176 --> 1:16:18.978
You make it sound so simple.

1:16:19.013 --> 1:16:20.716
Be with him or leave him.

1:16:20.751 --> 1:16:22.883
It is that simple.
But don't do it because of me.

1:16:22.918 --> 1:16:25.688
And quit dragging the guy along
if you're not gonna marry him.

1:16:25.723 --> 1:16:27.690
-Who says I'm not
going to marry him?
-Are you?

1:16:32.455 --> 1:16:35.731
Okay, look. You're right
about me, okay?

1:16:35.766 --> 1:16:37.733
I'm a chickenshit.
I don't believe in myself

1:16:37.768 --> 1:16:39.163
and putting anything of mine
out in the world

1:16:39.198 --> 1:16:41.132
absolutely terrifies me.

1:16:41.167 --> 1:16:44.773
But I think everything
we're losing sleep
over at night,

1:16:44.808 --> 1:16:46.236
isn't that complicated.

1:16:46.271 --> 1:16:48.238
Write a new song,
write a new poem.

1:16:48.273 --> 1:16:51.241
Take some time off.
Figure out what to do
with your guy.

1:16:51.276 --> 1:16:52.781
One day, we'll wake up,

1:16:52.816 --> 1:16:54.376
and right now will be
50 years ago.

1:16:54.411 --> 1:16:57.049
So by that standard,
today's pretty important, no?

1:16:59.482 --> 1:17:00.954
Quit being so poetic.

1:17:02.826 --> 1:17:05.794
If losing my parents--

1:17:05.829 --> 1:17:07.763
If losing my parents
has taught me anything,

1:17:07.798 --> 1:17:09.996
-it's the time we have left is--
-I know.

1:17:10.031 --> 1:17:12.295
We all want more, we don't use
what we've got.

1:17:12.330 --> 1:17:13.395
I remember.

1:17:17.170 --> 1:17:19.973
-Look, I told Dean that I--
-Yeah.

1:17:20.008 --> 1:17:20.908
No, I get it.

1:17:22.780 --> 1:17:25.275
I do have a little confession
to make

1:17:25.310 --> 1:17:28.278
about the photos.

1:17:28.313 --> 1:17:31.347
The photos didn't take
two or three days, they were,

1:17:31.382 --> 1:17:34.020
mm, pretty much done right away.

1:17:35.826 --> 1:17:37.386
Well, that seemed to
work out all right.

1:17:41.997 --> 1:17:44.261
I wanna see you tomorrow.

1:17:44.296 --> 1:17:46.461
Before you leave.

1:17:46.496 --> 1:17:48.397
It's an early flight, Jose.

1:17:48.432 --> 1:17:50.102
Don't care.

1:17:50.137 --> 1:17:53.303
Okay, then the piazza.
- 00 a.m.

1:17:53.338 --> 1:17:56.207
Ooh,- 00 a.m. doesn't exist.

1:17:56.242 --> 1:17:58.440
Unfortunately for you,
tomorrow it does.

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:06.118
Hal, I, I realized
on the way over here

1:18:06.153 --> 1:18:08.384
why I haven't been able
to get any writing done.

1:18:19.969 --> 1:18:21.067
You better show up.

1:18:21.102 --> 1:18:23.036
I'll show up.

1:18:34.082 --> 1:18:38.051
-Hey, sorry about that.
-Yeah, is everything okay or--

1:18:39.824 --> 1:18:41.516
Yeah.

1:18:41.551 --> 1:18:43.056
Are you okay?

1:18:43.091 --> 1:18:44.926
Yeah, I'm good. You good?

1:18:44.961 --> 1:18:46.422
Yeah, I'm great.

1:19:34.307 --> 1:19:35.977
Sorry.

1:19:36.012 --> 1:19:38.144
-Long day.

1:20:50.185 --> 1:20:52.317
-I have to go, but...
-Mm-hmm.

1:20:52.352 --> 1:20:53.989
I want you to have this.

1:20:54.024 --> 1:20:55.353
But all your stuff
is in here.

1:20:55.388 --> 1:20:56.651
I want it back eventually,

1:20:56.686 --> 1:21:00.028
but in the meantime...

1:21:00.063 --> 1:21:02.063
it's a mess, so don't judge.

1:21:03.627 --> 1:21:06.364
Was the trip worth it?

1:21:06.399 --> 1:21:08.069
I don't think that
quite sums it up.

1:21:10.205 --> 1:21:13.140
Have you, uh, figured out
what you're gonna do with your--

1:21:13.175 --> 1:21:15.703
I think I'm going to take
the advice of
a pretty smart girl.

1:21:15.738 --> 1:21:17.980
Gonna take some time
to write something.

1:21:18.015 --> 1:21:20.411
Mom would like that.

1:21:20.446 --> 1:21:22.380
Whoever said that
was a genius.

1:21:25.990 --> 1:21:28.518
Will I see you again?

1:21:28.553 --> 1:21:29.453
I hope so.

1:21:32.194 --> 1:21:34.260
Poem of the day?

1:21:34.295 --> 1:21:37.230
Uh, there's something
on the last page, but...

1:21:37.265 --> 1:21:39.034
actually, I wanted to share
something else

1:21:39.069 --> 1:21:42.037
to make this a little
less lopsided if that's okay.

1:21:42.072 --> 1:21:44.501
It's, uh, the only thing
I've ever shared

1:21:44.536 --> 1:21:48.505
outside of with my mom.
It was at her service.

1:21:48.540 --> 1:21:50.672
Um...

1:21:50.707 --> 1:21:52.575
"A letter from all those

1:21:52.610 --> 1:21:55.985
who have lost to those
found somewhere else.

1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:58.119
A child told me
you're in the clouds.

1:21:58.154 --> 1:21:59.747
I like that very much.

1:21:59.782 --> 1:22:01.419
For if you are in the clouds,

1:22:01.454 --> 1:22:03.685
I believe you're a part
of many things.

1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:06.193
The wind is not just
the wind but a whisper.

1:22:06.228 --> 1:22:08.624
The sun is not your son
but your smile.

1:22:08.659 --> 1:22:10.593
A flower in bloom,
your laughter,

1:22:10.628 --> 1:22:13.431
the butterfly that flutters by,
your dance,

1:22:13.466 --> 1:22:15.565
the moon and stars,
your embrace good night.

1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:17.237
And as you tip-toe
amongst the stars

1:22:17.272 --> 1:22:19.074
as to not wake me,

1:22:19.109 --> 1:22:20.603
as you dance
through constellations

1:22:20.638 --> 1:22:23.045
to a symphony of sounds
we're not yet aware,

1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:24.706
as you sail through
the oceans of the universe

1:22:24.741 --> 1:22:26.312
toward that place which
holds you in comfort,

1:22:26.347 --> 1:22:29.447
I ask you, to guide me
through my dreams,

1:22:29.482 --> 1:22:33.154
as I will dream of you
doing such things."

1:23:38.188 --> 1:23:39.847
Oh, cool. Fantastic.

1:23:39.882 --> 1:23:43.356
I see you just let yourself
into people's homes nowadays?

1:23:43.391 --> 1:23:44.522
Come on, man,
what's a guy gotta do

1:23:44.557 --> 1:23:46.194
to get a day off of work
around here, huh?

1:23:46.229 --> 1:23:47.195
I know, I know.

1:23:49.694 --> 1:23:52.134
A package came for you
at the shop and...

1:23:52.169 --> 1:23:53.531
I figured you'd want it
right away,

1:23:53.566 --> 1:23:55.665
hence the return address.

1:23:58.472 --> 1:24:00.472
Wha--

1:24:00.507 --> 1:24:01.440
Give me that.

1:24:03.279 --> 1:24:04.773
That's her, right?

1:24:06.612 --> 1:24:08.744
What're you waiting for, man?
Open it.

1:24:08.779 --> 1:24:09.679
Give me a second.

1:24:23.761 --> 1:24:25.431
What's that say?

1:24:25.466 --> 1:24:27.829
Sssht! just one second.

1:25:07.904 --> 1:25:09.508
<i>Am I allowed to--</i>

1:25:09.543 --> 1:25:11.708
-Yes. Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

1:25:11.743 --> 1:25:13.545
-Thank you.

1:25:13.580 --> 1:25:15.349
-That's a heavy chair.
-Argh.

1:25:17.353 --> 1:25:18.616
Very clever, by the way.

1:25:18.651 --> 1:25:21.355
I thought you'd
appreciate that.

1:25:21.390 --> 1:25:23.753
-So you're playing
a show here tonight?
-Guilty.

1:25:23.788 --> 1:25:26.855
It's a pretty obscure part
of the world for a folk singer.

1:25:26.890 --> 1:25:30.463
I may have pulled
a few strings.

1:25:30.498 --> 1:25:33.961
Um, so I have a new single
coming out tomorrow.

1:25:33.996 --> 1:25:35.699
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Mm.

1:25:35.734 --> 1:25:37.602
And you're kind of
a co-writer on it.

1:25:37.637 --> 1:25:40.638
So I thought I should
probably play it for you first.

1:25:40.673 --> 1:25:44.477
Okay, well, aren't I gonna
hear it tonight at the show?

1:25:44.512 --> 1:25:45.511
Not good enough.

1:25:51.783 --> 1:25:53.849
Oh, um,
it's called "Molto Bella."
