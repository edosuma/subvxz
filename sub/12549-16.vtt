WEBVTT

00:06.967 --> 00:08.549
Lacey: PREVIOUSLY
ON "TWISTED..."

00:08.549 --> 00:10.221
- Jo: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
- Danny: HE'S DEAD.

00:10.221 --> 00:11.972
I KILLED MY OWN FATHER.

00:11.972 --> 00:14.185
VIKRAM, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP?

00:14.185 --> 00:16.187
YOU NEED TO
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

00:16.187 --> 00:19.230
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND THE ENTIRE GREENGROVE
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:19.230 --> 00:21.142
SORRY FOR EVERYTHING
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH.

00:21.142 --> 00:22.983
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
CHARLIE MCBRIDE.

00:22.983 --> 00:24.105
WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:24.105 --> 00:25.276
- EASY.
- SO, WHAT?
YOU FOLLOWED ME?

00:25.276 --> 00:27.108
I REMEMBERED HOW YOU
WERE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND

00:27.108 --> 00:29.110
TO ME ON THE INSIDE.
I JUST WANT TO START OVER.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.861
- Jo: WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF HER?
- WHO, ANDIE?

00:30.861 --> 00:32.203
I THINK YOU SHOULD
ASK HER TO HOMECOMING.

00:32.203 --> 00:34.205
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST
NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.287
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE TOO.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.958
I'M ON THE SOCCER TEAM
WITH DANNY

00:37.958 --> 00:39.920
HE HAD A LOT OF NICE THINGS
TO SAY ABOUT YOU.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.332
IN THE FIRST DAY
THAT HE'S BEEN BACK?

00:41.332 --> 00:44.044
GUYS TALK, ESPECIALLY
ABOUT PRETTY GIRLS.

00:45.296 --> 00:46.877
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.929
HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.511
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:50.511 --> 00:52.052
( Tess on phone ): Vikram,
Kyle's looking for you.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.265
He's determined to find you.
I'm so confused.

00:54.265 --> 00:55.976
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING,
TRYING TO PROVE

00:55.976 --> 00:58.179
THAT VIKRAM'S STILL ALIVE
AND YOU KNEW HE WAS!

00:58.179 --> 00:59.180
YOU ARE GONNA COME
DOWN TO THE STATION

00:59.180 --> 01:01.061
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.233
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.985
HELLO.
I'M ON MY WAY.

01:04.985 --> 01:07.188
THEY FOUND VIKRAM.
HE'S DEAD.

01:15.996 --> 01:17.248
HEY, YOU OKAY?

01:17.248 --> 01:19.910
YEAH, I JUST MISSED YOU.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.292
I MISSED YOU TOO,
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

01:24.205 --> 01:26.917
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH--

01:26.917 --> 01:28.209
IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ALL OVER.

01:28.209 --> 01:30.090
ALL THAT MATTERS
TO ME RIGHT NOW

01:30.090 --> 01:32.052
IS BEING HERE
WITH YOU.

01:41.892 --> 01:44.024
( phone vibrates )

01:44.024 --> 01:45.146
- SORRY.
- ( giggles )

01:45.146 --> 01:47.107
I'M GONNA TURN
THIS OFF, OKAY?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.029
YEAH.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.944
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:53.944 --> 01:54.995
UH...

01:54.995 --> 01:56.867
ACTUALLY, IT'S, UH...

01:58.289 --> 02:00.911
IT'S-- IT'S MY--
IT'S MY DAD. HE--

02:00.911 --> 02:02.873
DID THEY FIND HIM?
WHERE IS HE?

02:02.873 --> 02:06.006
UH, HE'S DEAD.

02:06.006 --> 02:07.298
WHAT?

02:07.298 --> 02:09.129
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO,
ACTUALLY.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.301
YEAH, I'M COMING WITH YOU.

02:10.301 --> 02:11.882
NO, NO.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.215
UM, MY MOM, SHE'S
GONNA BE A MESS.

02:14.215 --> 02:16.056
UH, I SHOULD
GO ALONE.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.928
OKAY, YEAH,
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.223
I'M SORRY.

02:22.223 --> 02:25.105
DANNY, NO.
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.272
Danny: DID YOUR DAD
SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

02:31.272 --> 02:33.073
JUST THAT
THEY FOUND HIM.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.945
HE LEFT BEFORE
I COULD FIND OUT MORE.

02:34.945 --> 02:37.278
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.
A NORMAL LIFE WAS
NEVER AN OPTION,

02:37.278 --> 02:38.279
NOT FOR ME.

02:38.279 --> 02:40.160
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.122
WE'LL EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:42.122 --> 02:43.954
THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE US.

02:43.954 --> 02:45.165
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.959
WE'LL FACE IT,
WHATEVER HAPPENS.

02:53.093 --> 02:55.346
WE SHOULD BE SEEING
LIGHTS BY NOW.

02:55.346 --> 02:57.137
YEAH.

03:06.146 --> 03:08.188
THIS DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

03:17.027 --> 03:19.079
WHAT?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.283
WHAT IS IT?

03:24.084 --> 03:26.206
Danny: HE'S GONE.

03:27.167 --> 03:29.960
( theme music plays )

03:36.176 --> 03:37.338
- ( sirens wail )
- ( chattering )

03:37.338 --> 03:39.890
( radio dispatch chatter )

03:43.304 --> 03:45.306
OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.978
Kyle: I JUST CHASED TWO
REPORTERS AWAY ALREADY.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.980
SO JUST KEEP 'EM BACK
AS BEST YOU CAN, OKAY?

03:49.980 --> 03:50.981
- Officer: WILL DO.
- I WANT THE FAMILY

03:50.981 --> 03:51.982
TO HEAR THIS FROM ME.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.233
HOLD ON A SECOND, GUYS.

03:57.858 --> 03:59.860
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.241
( chattering continues )

04:01.241 --> 04:02.953
( sighs )

04:10.871 --> 04:11.922
HEY.

04:11.922 --> 04:15.135
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

04:15.135 --> 04:16.216
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW.

04:16.216 --> 04:17.548
I PATCHED THAT CAR UP
PRETTY QUICK.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.219
I WANT TO MAKE SURE DANNY
GETS HOME IN ONE PIECE.

04:19.219 --> 04:21.261
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WHY YOU STAYED?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.183
THE SCENERY'S NOT TOO BAD,
EITHER.

04:23.183 --> 04:25.055
( car door closes )

04:26.186 --> 04:27.978
Jack:
OH, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

04:27.978 --> 04:30.270
HEY, SWEETIE, DID YOU
HAVE A NICE TIME WITH LACEY?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.152
SHE DIG THE WHEELS?

04:36.196 --> 04:39.029
OH MY GOD, WHAT'S WRONG?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.322
MOM, UH, IT'S--
IT'S DAD.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.994
- ( siren wails )
- DID HE CONTACT YOU?

04:43.994 --> 04:47.117
- NO, HE--
- ( siren blares )

04:49.870 --> 04:51.041
( car door
opens and closes )

04:52.292 --> 04:54.044
KYLE?

04:55.175 --> 04:57.338
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:57.338 --> 04:58.969
THERE'S BEEN
A CAR ACCIDENT.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.130
IT'S VIKRAM.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.924
I'M SORRY,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

05:06.096 --> 05:08.228
( sighs )
OH MY GOD.

05:08.228 --> 05:10.230
WAIT, WH-- A CAR CRASH?
WHERE?

05:10.230 --> 05:12.142
I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.
KAREN, WE NEED YOU

05:12.142 --> 05:14.064
TO COME DOWN AND
IDENTIFY THE BODY.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.145
OKAY,
I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA
COME WITH YOU.

05:15.145 --> 05:17.988
- YEAH, GO, I'LL LOCK UP.
- OKAY.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.111
YOU HAVE A KEY?

05:21.111 --> 05:23.113
I KNOW WHERE SHE KEEPS IT.

05:36.216 --> 05:37.918
( door opens )

05:39.089 --> 05:41.922
JO, HEY.

05:41.922 --> 05:44.264
WHERE'D YOU RUN OFF TO?

05:44.264 --> 05:47.307
I JUST WANTED TO
CHECK ON DANNY.

05:47.307 --> 05:49.229
HOW IS HE?

05:49.229 --> 05:51.101
HE'S SHOCKED.

05:52.893 --> 05:54.144
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:54.144 --> 05:56.236
YEAH.

05:56.236 --> 05:59.149
I-- I HEARD YOU
AND DAD TALKING.

05:59.149 --> 06:02.112
IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
A REPORT?

06:02.112 --> 06:04.114
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.247
UM, I'M JUST UPSET
ABOUT VIKRAM.

06:07.247 --> 06:11.081
I KNOW HE DID A LOT
OF TERRIBLE THINGS,

06:11.081 --> 06:13.203
BUT HE WAS A REALLY
SWEET GUY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:13.203 --> 06:16.296
DO YOU...

06:16.296 --> 06:19.259
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

06:19.259 --> 06:21.261
CAR ACCIDENT.

06:21.261 --> 06:23.884
ON CUTLER'S RIDGE.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.265
IT WAS ON THE NEWS.

06:25.265 --> 06:27.057
HE MAY HAVE BEEN DRINKING.

06:27.057 --> 06:29.139
WE ALL KNOW WHAT A PROBLEM
THAT HAD BECOME.

06:31.271 --> 06:34.935
WELL, I'M GONNA GO TO BED.
I'M REALLY TIRED, SO...

06:34.935 --> 06:36.316
OKAY.

06:53.033 --> 06:55.035
IT'S HIM.

06:57.998 --> 06:59.169
EVEN WITH
EVERYTHING HE DID,

06:59.169 --> 07:00.961
I KNOW IT ISN'T EASY.

07:00.961 --> 07:02.883
THANK YOU, SIR.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.262
I'D LIKE THIS WRAPPED UP
AS QUICKLY AND DISCREETLY
AS POSSIBLE.

07:12.262 --> 07:15.015
I WANT THAT BASTARD
IN THE GROUND.

07:15.015 --> 07:17.057
MOM, HE'S GOT--
HE'S GOT A JOB
HE'S GOT TO DO.

07:17.057 --> 07:18.358
YEAH, AND THE SOONER
HE DOES IT, THE BETTER.

07:18.358 --> 07:20.941
THAT MAN WAS INVOLVED IN
AN INNOCENT GIRL'S MURDER.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.903
AND HE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY
TO LET YOU ROT FOR IT.

07:22.903 --> 07:25.946
- I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN.
- THANK YOU.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.954
LOOK, HONEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE OVERWHELMED.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.036
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

07:36.036 --> 07:38.168
THIS NIGHTMARE
IS FINALLY OVER.

07:38.168 --> 07:39.880
AND WE CAN MOVE ON.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.962
THINGS ARE GONNA
TURN AROUND FOR US.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.343
TURN AROUND? HOW ARE THEY
GONNA TURN AROUND, MOM?

07:43.343 --> 07:45.966
YOUR FATHER HAD
A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY...

07:47.257 --> 07:49.179
FOR $10 MILLION.

07:49.179 --> 07:52.182
WHAT? WH-- WHY?

07:52.182 --> 07:53.353
HE DID THAT FOR US?

07:53.353 --> 07:55.305
HMPH, WELL,
KNOWING YOUR FATHER,

07:55.305 --> 07:57.938
HE PROBABLY FAKED HIS DEATH
TO GET THE MONEY.

07:57.938 --> 08:00.230
COME ON, SWEETIE.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.312
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.875
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

08:14.875 --> 08:16.206
I HAVE NO CLUE.

08:16.206 --> 08:18.078
WHAT DID MY DAD SAY?

08:18.078 --> 08:20.210
THERE WAS A CRASH.
THAT HE'S DOING AN AUTOPSY.

08:20.210 --> 08:22.122
BUT, JO, HE'S NOT
SUSPICIOUS AT ALL.

08:22.122 --> 08:25.295
SO SOMEONE'S JUST--
JUST CLEANING UP THE MESS.

08:25.295 --> 08:27.127
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

08:27.127 --> 08:29.219
MY MOM SAYS THAT THERE'S
AN INSURANCE POLICY,

08:29.219 --> 08:30.220
LIKE MILLIONS.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.972
WHAT?

08:31.972 --> 08:33.183
I KNOW.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.305
IF I HAD TOLD THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

08:35.305 --> 08:38.058
EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
I KILLED MY DAD FOR THE MONEY.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.141
I WOULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

08:41.141 --> 08:43.233
I JUST-- I DON'T GET IT.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.197
SOMEONE MOVED HIS BODY,
PUT IT IN THAT CAR.

08:47.197 --> 08:49.319
I MEAN, IS SOMEONE
TRYING TO PROTECT US?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.863
OH MY GOD, MY MOM.

08:52.863 --> 08:54.204
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
- EARLIER TONIGHT,

08:54.204 --> 08:55.956
I HEARD MY PARENTS TALKING.

08:55.956 --> 08:57.918
MY DAD WANTS MY MOM
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

08:57.918 --> 08:59.119
BUT SHE WON'T
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.041
AND THEN THERE'S MY MOM.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.923
I MEAN, SHE'D DO
ANYTHING FOR ME.

09:02.923 --> 09:04.214
AND SHE KNEW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH MONEY SHE'D GET

09:04.214 --> 09:05.255
IF THE BODY WAS FOUND.

09:05.255 --> 09:08.258
AT LEAST WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST THEM.

09:08.258 --> 09:10.130
WHAT IF--

09:10.130 --> 09:12.302
WHAT IF IT'S SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO HELP US?

09:12.302 --> 09:15.055
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF THIS
PERSON WHO MOVED THE BODY

09:15.055 --> 09:17.137
AND FAKED THE ACCIDENT--
WHAT IF--

09:17.137 --> 09:19.229
WHAT IF THEY WANT SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW?

09:19.229 --> 09:21.311
- TO KEEP QUIET.
- LIKE BLACKMAIL?

09:21.311 --> 09:23.063
YEAH.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.066
OH, THIS IS SO MESSED UP.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.237
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO IT IS, JO.

09:27.237 --> 09:28.358
OKAY, THEY KNOW.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.901
THEY KNOW WHAT I DID.

09:30.901 --> 09:31.902
NO, DANNY.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.193
WHAT WE DID.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.661
JUST THE ONE COFFEE.

09:40.661 --> 09:42.623
THANKS.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.964
HEY, JO.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.005
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

09:45.005 --> 09:48.088
YEAH, SO ARE YOU.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.671
WE UM--
WE NEVER WENT HOME.

09:50.671 --> 09:52.172
WE WENT TO THIS AFTER-PARTY,
BUT IT KINDA SUCKED.

09:52.172 --> 09:55.976
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE
A MONSTER-TRUCK RALLY
OF HUMANITY...

09:55.976 --> 09:58.018
- WITH SEX.
- ( laughs )

09:58.018 --> 09:59.720
YEAH, WE WENT FOR
A WALK INSTEAD.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.021
AND THEN
BEFORE WE KNEW IT,
IT WAS DAWN.

10:01.021 --> 10:04.815
WE RECITED KEATS AND SHELLEY
TO THE RISING SUN.

10:04.815 --> 10:06.777
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME.
IT'S REALLY--

10:06.777 --> 10:07.858
IT'S EXHILARATING.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.821
SO HOW DOES YOUR MOM
FEEL ABOUT THIS?

10:10.821 --> 10:12.032
UH...

10:12.032 --> 10:14.034
SHE'S PROBABLY
CALLING THE COPS,

10:14.034 --> 10:15.866
ALERTING THE MEDIA,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.866 --> 10:16.947
I DON'T THINK I CARE.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.618
PLUS, I WANTED TO
HAVE ONE LAST MEAL

10:18.618 --> 10:19.950
BEFORE REAPING
THE WHIRLWIND.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.002
CHOCOLATE CHIP WAFFLES,
EXTRA CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

10:22.002 --> 10:24.084
IT'S OUR FAVORITE.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.747
Andie: EAT WITH US, JO.

10:26.747 --> 10:27.878
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR MOM'S FUNDRAISER...

10:27.878 --> 10:29.629
FOR THE CHILDREN'S
BURN FOUNDATION.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.012
OH, DID YOU KNOW
THE FOUNDATION SAVED
HER SISTER'S LIFE?

10:32.012 --> 10:33.844
ANDIE'S SUPER INVOLVED
IN THEM.

10:33.844 --> 10:35.135
SHE'S EVEN ON THE
PREVENTION COMMITTEE.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.888
OUR FUTURE VALEDICTORIAN
IS BASICALLY A SAINT.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.720
I'M NOT A SAINT.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.101
PLUS, I'M TOTALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO SHARE

10:41.101 --> 10:42.642
- VALEDICTORIAN WITH YOU.
- Rico: WELL, NOT IF

10:42.642 --> 10:44.024
YOUR GENOME MODELS TURN OUT
LIKE I THINK THEY WILL.

10:44.024 --> 10:45.936
- YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'RE THAT GOOD?
- YEAH.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.067
OKAY, SO, THANKS
FOR THE OFFER.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.939
BUT I'VE GOT TO RUN.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.941
I'M JUST GRABBING
THIS COFFEE FOR MY DAD, SO...

10:50.941 --> 10:53.694
OH, I FORGOT TO ASK.
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

10:53.694 --> 10:56.697
OH! IT WAS--
IT WAS UNEVENTFUL.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.699
I JUST-- I WENT HOME EARLY.

10:59.830 --> 11:00.911
GO GET YOUR WAFFLES.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.045
( cash register chimes )

11:05.045 --> 11:07.748
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH, THANK YOU, HERE.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.883
( chattering )

11:12.883 --> 11:14.054
( door opens )

11:15.055 --> 11:17.637
- OH! I'M--
- OH! SORRY.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.800
IT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.641
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

11:21.641 --> 11:23.063
YEAH, NO SPILLS, SO...

11:23.063 --> 11:25.976
NO, I MEANT ABOUT DANNY.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.899
THE ACCIDENT, YOU KNOW. IT WAS
ALL OVER THE NEWS LAST NIGHT.

11:28.899 --> 11:31.021
OH.

11:31.021 --> 11:35.615
YEAH, I THINK--
I THINK WE'RE ALL JUST
IN A STATE OF SHOCK.

11:35.615 --> 11:37.077
YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE.

11:37.077 --> 11:38.869
FREAK ACCIDENT
LIKE THAT.

11:38.869 --> 11:41.621
WELL, HEY, I MEAN,
IF YOU SEE DANNY,

11:41.621 --> 11:43.874
WILL YOU LET HIM
KNOW I'M SORRY?

11:43.874 --> 11:45.996
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

11:49.039 --> 11:51.962
WELL, I SHOULD GO
BEFORE THIS GETS COLD,
SO...

11:51.962 --> 11:54.634
RIGHT.
SEE YOU.

11:54.634 --> 11:55.715
BYE.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.967
AND, HEY, UH...

11:56.967 --> 12:00.100
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING, OKAY?

12:00.100 --> 12:02.052
OKAY.

12:07.057 --> 12:08.728
Kyle: THANKS.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.691
YOU COULD TAR A ROOF
WITH THE STUFF THEY MAKE HERE.

12:14.654 --> 12:15.946
YOU NEVER CAME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

12:15.946 --> 12:18.618
YEAH, DIDN'T WANT ANY HICCUPS.

12:18.618 --> 12:20.740
WE JUST RELEASED
VIKRAM'S BODY FOR BURIAL.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.703
ALREADY.

12:23.703 --> 12:26.746
SO IT WAS REALLY
JUST AN ACCIDENT.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.869
I DON'T KNOW.

12:28.869 --> 12:31.001
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WANTED HIM DEAD.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.873
BUT WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE
OF FOUL PLAY,

12:32.873 --> 12:33.924
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.877
I TALKED
TO MOM LAST NIGHT.

12:36.877 --> 12:39.970
SHE SEEMED REALLY UPSET.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.681
UPSET, HOW?

12:41.681 --> 12:42.973
SHE SAID IT
WAS ABOUT VIKRAM.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.937
WHAT'S GOING ON, DAD?

12:46.937 --> 12:50.100
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT GETTING HER TO
MAKE A STATEMENT.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.893
DID SHE DO
SOMETHING ILLEGAL?

12:52.893 --> 12:55.695
I HAD TO FILE A REPORT.
SHE CAN EXPLAIN IT.

12:55.695 --> 12:57.067
WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO WEIRD?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.859
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:58.859 --> 13:00.821
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO HEAR IT FROM HER.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.034
JUST TALK TO YOUR MOTHER
ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

13:04.034 --> 13:06.076
YEAH, FINE.

13:07.868 --> 13:09.669
HEY, WAIT.

13:10.961 --> 13:13.753
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

13:17.878 --> 13:20.680
Karen:
YOU KNEW VIKRAM
WAS ALIVE?!

13:20.680 --> 13:22.843
HOW COULD YOU KEEP
A SECRET LIKE THAT?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.845
THERE WAS A MANHUNT
FOR MY SON.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.056
- HE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.
- I KNOW.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.018
IT WAS WRONG.
I WAS SCARED.

13:28.018 --> 13:29.019
AND CONFUSED.

13:29.019 --> 13:30.060
AND WHAT?!

13:30.060 --> 13:31.892
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
BRING ME A CASSEROLE

13:31.892 --> 13:33.773
AND EVERYTHING
WOULD BE FINE?!

13:33.773 --> 13:36.696
THERE'S NOT EXACTLY A ROADMAP
FOR THIS KIND OF SITUATION.

13:38.989 --> 13:41.902
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY.

13:41.902 --> 13:44.704
AND I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HEAR IT FROM ME FIRST.

13:44.704 --> 13:47.707
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HIM.
ADMIT IT.

13:47.707 --> 13:48.949
YOU NEVER
STOPPED LOVING HIM.

13:48.949 --> 13:50.710
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

13:50.710 --> 13:53.954
OH, AND YOU'RE
IN A PLACE TO LECTURE ME
ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR?!

13:54.955 --> 13:57.007
- GET OUT!
- KAREN.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.718
YOU WANT ME TO
CALL THE POLICE?

14:09.809 --> 14:11.892
AND TAKE YOUR DAMN
CASSEROLE WITH YOU!

14:13.643 --> 14:16.736
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
I'VE LOST MY FATHER
IN SIX MONTHS.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.068
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

14:18.068 --> 14:21.821
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
YOU NEEDED CLOSURE.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.286
DANNY, I KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

14:26.286 --> 14:27.787
FOR YOUR FATHER TO GET CAUGHT
SO YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH

14:27.787 --> 14:28.909
ABOUT YOUR AUNT TARA.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.040
- LACEY--
- YOU SHOULD TELL NOW.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.792
NO. NO ONE'S
GONNA BELIEVE ME.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.084
I BELIEVE YOU.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.665
AND JO BELIEVES YOU.

14:35.665 --> 14:37.047
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.

14:39.759 --> 14:41.881
ARE YOU REALLY WILLING
TO LIVE WITH A LIE FOREVER?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.054
I'VE LIVED WITH IT
THIS LONG.

14:52.102 --> 14:53.893
HEY, HONEY.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.185
WOULD YOU MIND
IF WE ORDERED IN?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.977
I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO
FOR THIS CHARITY AUCTION.

14:56.977 --> 14:58.939
I ASKED DAD ABOUT
THAT POLICE REPORT.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.022
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME
WHAT YOU DID, EITHER.

15:02.022 --> 15:04.864
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

15:04.864 --> 15:06.866
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.989
THEY FIND DANNY'S DAD
THE SAME DAY

15:08.989 --> 15:11.081
THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
FOR SOMETHING.

15:11.081 --> 15:12.662
THOSE TWO THINGS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO

15:12.662 --> 15:14.664
- WITH EACH OTHER.
- THAN WHAT IS IT?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.705
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:17.627 --> 15:18.798
MOM.

15:18.798 --> 15:21.631
I KNEW THAT VIKRAM WAS ALIVE.

15:23.043 --> 15:24.924
I'D BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HIM

15:24.924 --> 15:26.636
AND YOUR FATHER FOUND OUT.

15:26.636 --> 15:27.968
YOU KNEW?

15:27.968 --> 15:29.809
JO...

15:29.809 --> 15:32.892
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT ANYONE.

15:32.892 --> 15:34.854
BUT HE WAS SCARED
FOR HIS LIFE

15:34.854 --> 15:37.687
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.061
MOM, IF YOU HAD
JUST TOLD THE TRUTH,

15:41.061 --> 15:42.983
THING'S WOULD
BE SO DIFFERENT.
WE'D--

15:44.824 --> 15:46.656
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

15:46.656 --> 15:47.988
- WERE THE TWO OF YOU, LIKE--
- NO.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.949
WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.992
AND I'D KNOWN HIM
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.833
NO, I CAN'T. I CAN'T--

15:53.833 --> 15:54.914
JUST THINK ABOUT DANNY.

15:54.914 --> 15:57.667
NO! DANNY IS NOTHING LIKE HIM.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.709
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.792
BUT YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT WHO HE BECAME,

16:02.792 --> 16:03.883
NOT WHO HE WAS.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.049
WE'D BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH TOGETHER

16:09.049 --> 16:10.970
AND WE SHARED EVERYTHING.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.642
AND THERE WAS
A TIME IN MY LIFE

16:12.642 --> 16:15.895
WHEN HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
I COULD TRUST.

16:15.895 --> 16:19.059
DID YOU KNOW
WHERE HE WAS HIDING?

16:19.059 --> 16:22.102
- DID YOU SEE--
- I SWEAR TO YOU, I DIDN'T.

16:22.102 --> 16:24.734
ALL I HAD WAS
A PHONE NUMBER.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.776
JO.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.910
I KNOW I HURT YOU
AND YOUR FATHER.

16:30.910 --> 16:35.075
AND I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING MORE I COULD SAY.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.708
I DID WHAT
I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.

16:39.829 --> 16:41.671
AND I WAS WRONG.

16:47.927 --> 16:49.969
Danny: MAYBE YOU
SHOULD FORGIVE TESS.

16:49.969 --> 16:52.011
Karen: DANNY, WHY WOULD
YOU EVEN SUGGEST THAT?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.894
- TESS WAS--
- DAD WAS THE MASTER
MANIPULATOR.

16:54.894 --> 16:56.766
HE COULD CONVINCE
ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.848
WELL, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.811
HEY, WHO'S HUNGRY?

17:04.644 --> 17:05.735
NO? YOU'RE SURE?
'CAUSE I THINK

17:05.735 --> 17:06.776
I SAW SOME TASTY
CASSEROLE OUT THERE

17:06.776 --> 17:07.947
ON THE FRONT STOOP.

17:07.947 --> 17:09.028
WE'LL JUST PICK
THE GLASS OUT.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.860
WE CAN ORDER PIZZA.

17:10.860 --> 17:12.952
I THINK I HAVE A CREDIT CARD
THAT'S NOT MAXED OUT.

17:12.952 --> 17:14.704
NO, NO, NO.
PIZZA'S ON ME.

17:14.704 --> 17:15.915
I GOT A GREAT DEAL
ON A RUNABOUT THIS WEEK.

17:15.915 --> 17:17.657
AND I HAVE
THIS GREAT APP,

17:17.657 --> 17:19.659
LETS ME ORDER
RIGHT FROM MY PHONE.

17:19.659 --> 17:20.830
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW FAST IT COMES.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.662
( doorbell rings )

17:22.662 --> 17:24.794
- SEE?
- NO, I THINK IT'S
THE INSURANCE AGENT.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.086
THEY NEED SOME SIGNATURES.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.973
- HI.
- MRS. DESAI?

17:33.973 --> 17:36.096
YES, PLEASE COME IN.

17:36.096 --> 17:40.810
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING TO DRINK?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.021
OH, THANK YOU, NO.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.644
IF I COULD JUST SPEAK
WITH YOU AND DANIEL?

17:44.644 --> 17:45.895
Karen: UH, DANNY? WHY?

17:45.895 --> 17:48.108
WELL, I'LL NEED HIS
SIGNATURE AS WELL.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.819
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.821
DANNY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:51.821 --> 17:52.992
I DON'T KNOW.
HEY!

17:52.992 --> 17:55.034
HI, SORRY.
I'M DANIEL.

17:55.034 --> 17:57.617
EXCELLENT.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

17:57.617 --> 17:59.829
WHY ARE YOU
INVOLVING MY SON?

17:59.829 --> 18:02.872
I'M VIKRAM'S WIDOW
AND MY NAME'S ON THE POLICY.

18:02.872 --> 18:04.834
YES, YES, INITIALLY IT WAS.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.627
BUT MR. DESAI
MADE SOME CHANGES.

18:11.881 --> 18:13.803
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

18:13.803 --> 18:15.765
UH, NO, I DIDN'T.

18:15.765 --> 18:17.717
I GUESS I ASSUMED...

18:19.769 --> 18:20.980
( clears throat )

18:20.980 --> 18:23.813
WELL, OF COURSE,
IT WAS MR. DESAI'S POLICY.

18:23.813 --> 18:25.775
HE COULD DO WITH IT
AS HE SAW FIT.

18:25.775 --> 18:28.067
AND WHAT DID HE
SEE FIT TO DO?

18:28.067 --> 18:32.652
HE SET UP A TRUST
IN DANIEL'S NAME,

18:32.652 --> 18:33.903
WITH YOU
AS CUSTODIAN.

18:33.903 --> 18:35.034
OF COURSE HE DID.

18:35.034 --> 18:36.996
WAIT, IS HE--
IS HE SAYING THAT--

18:36.996 --> 18:39.829
YES, YOUR FATHER
LEFT THE MONEY TO YOU,

18:39.829 --> 18:41.871
ALL 10 MILLION.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.257
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

18:57.257 --> 18:58.638
I'M RESEARCHING YOUR TRUST.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.600
UNTIL YOU'RE 18,
I HAVE TO ENSURE

19:00.600 --> 19:02.432
THAT IT'S ONLY BEING SPENT
ON YOUR WELFARE.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.395
MY WELFARE?

19:05.395 --> 19:07.607
YOU KNOW, BOOKS, CLOTHES,
OUR MORTGAGE.

19:07.607 --> 19:09.529
AND I'LL MAKE PERIODIC
REPORTS TO THE COURT.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.531
APPEARANCES WHERE
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY

19:11.531 --> 19:14.153
IF I'M DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.448
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA GO THIS WAY.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.411
MUST BE DISAPPOINTING.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.494
LOOK, I'M SURE YOUR
FATHER DREAMED THIS UP

19:24.494 --> 19:26.286
AS A WAY TO PUNISH ME.

19:26.286 --> 19:29.168
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE THE BAIT.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.500
WHATEVER HIS INTENTIONS,

19:30.500 --> 19:33.503
I'M TRULY HAPPY FOR YOU.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.555
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

19:35.555 --> 19:38.177
WHAT KIND OF MONEY-GRUBBER
DO YOU THINK I AM?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.559
NO, MOM, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

19:39.559 --> 19:42.222
AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.354
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK
MY PERMISSION TO BUY STUFF.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.356
WELL,
THE LAW IS THE LAW.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.437
SCREW THE LAW.
YOU'RE MY MOM.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.188
AND I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE YOU TO COURT.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.231
I'M SERIOUS.
I TRUST YOU.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.652
AND I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THIS MONEY.

19:52.652 --> 19:54.364
JUST THINK OF IT
AS YOUR OWN, ALL RIGHT?

20:01.321 --> 20:03.243
Lacey:
EVERYTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.375
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS,

20:05.375 --> 20:07.377
BUT ONCE WORD
GETS OUT AT SCHOOL,

20:07.377 --> 20:11.421
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
YOURSELF WITH A LOT
OF NEW BEST FRIENDS.

20:11.421 --> 20:13.212
SO IF YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT--

20:13.212 --> 20:14.544
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT, HONESTLY.

20:14.544 --> 20:17.257
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.259
I KNOW, BUT YOU
HAVE TO BE PREPARED.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.220
I GET IT.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.602
FIRST, THEY HATE ME
FOR THE WRONG REASON

20:22.602 --> 20:23.603
AND NOW THEY WANT
TO KISS UP TO ME

20:23.603 --> 20:25.305
FOR THE WRONG REASON.

20:25.305 --> 20:28.187
WELCOME TO HIGH SCHOOL.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.613
BUT, HEY, IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THAT WAY WITH US.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.446
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.627
( whispering )

20:56.215 --> 20:57.507
HEY, DANNY.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.221
HEY, GOD, THIS SUCKS, BUT
I FORGOT MY LUNCH MONEY.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.434
COULD I BORROW, LIKE,
A MILLION DOLLARS?

21:04.434 --> 21:06.596
( laughs )

21:09.268 --> 21:11.441
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
DANNY WARBUCKS.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.563
GOD, DOES EVERYBODY KNOW?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.656
YEAH, SOME GIRL'S DAD
WORKS AT THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

21:16.656 --> 21:18.658
- IT'S ALL OVER FACEBOOK.
- GREAT.

21:18.658 --> 21:21.160
LOOK, MAN, WHEN
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR DAD,

21:21.160 --> 21:23.242
I WANTED TO...

21:23.242 --> 21:25.325
HOW YOU DOING?

21:25.325 --> 21:27.327
I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU HATED THE GUY,

21:27.327 --> 21:29.539
BUT I GUESS THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT ANY BETTER, RIGHT?

21:32.502 --> 21:34.504
- THANKS, MAN.
- ON THE PLUS SIDE,

21:34.504 --> 21:37.587
10 MILLION BUCKS IS
A HELL OF A SILVER LINING.

21:39.379 --> 21:41.260
( bell rings )

21:57.316 --> 21:59.238
ALL SET.
JUST NEED YOUR
JOHN HANCOCK

21:59.238 --> 22:00.860
SO WE CAN SALVAGE
THIS PUPPY.

22:00.860 --> 22:03.533
NIGHTS HAVE BEEN BELOW
THE 30s THIS LAST WEEK,
HAVEN'T THEY?

22:03.533 --> 22:05.535
YEAH, SO?

22:05.535 --> 22:07.326
SO IT'S AWFULLY COLD

22:07.326 --> 22:09.409
TO BE DRIVING WITH
YOUR WINDOW DOWN.

22:09.409 --> 22:12.502
HOLD OFF ON THE SALVAGE.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.420
( students chatter )

22:21.591 --> 22:23.423
- HEY.
- HEY.

22:23.423 --> 22:25.264
SO MY MOM--

22:25.264 --> 22:26.556
YEAH, KNEW
MY FATHER WAS ALIVE.

22:26.556 --> 22:28.307
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

22:28.307 --> 22:29.639
THINK SHE KNOWS
ANYTHING ELSE?

22:29.639 --> 22:31.431
I CAN'T TELL.

22:31.431 --> 22:34.273
SHE SAID HE WAS WORRIED
THAT SOMEONE WANTED TO KILL HIM.

22:34.273 --> 22:35.605
SOMEBODY DID.

22:38.528 --> 22:40.480
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

22:40.480 --> 22:41.611
UM, I'M NOT SURE.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.533
THIS MONEY KINDA JUST
COMPLICATES THINGS.

22:47.156 --> 22:48.578
I'M TELLING YOU.
SHE HATES ME.

22:48.578 --> 22:50.580
MISS MOSELEY'S LIKE THAT
WITH EVERYONE.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.492
JUST STICK TO
THE SYLLABUS.

22:52.492 --> 22:54.253
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

22:54.253 --> 22:56.496
DUDE, ARE YOU GONNA LIKE
BUY AN AIRPLANE NOW?

22:56.496 --> 22:59.258
I GUESS I COULD.

22:59.258 --> 23:00.880
I HAVEN'T REALLY
GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.172
'CAUSE YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO
IF I HAD $10 MILLION?

23:03.172 --> 23:05.214
I'M GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS
AND SAY, "BUY AN AIRPLANE."

23:05.214 --> 23:07.386
I'D START CHARITIES.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.429
TEN. A MILLION DOLLARS EACH.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.220
OR MAYBE ONE SUPER CHARITY.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.182
WELL, I-- YEAH--
I'D DO THAT TOO

23:13.182 --> 23:14.434
BEFORE I BOUGHT A PLANE.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.566
- WELL, I WOULD BUY A HOUSE...
- NICE.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.357
FOR THE ANIMAL SHELTER.

23:18.357 --> 23:21.481
OKAY, I GET IT.
I'M SELFISH.

23:21.481 --> 23:22.572
YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW
THERE WAS A TIME

23:22.572 --> 23:24.283
WHEN WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT MONEY.

23:24.283 --> 23:26.325
I THINK IT WAS
LIKE YESTERDAY.

23:26.325 --> 23:27.366
C'MON, JO.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.198
HE DESERVES
A LITTLE GOOD LUCK.

23:29.198 --> 23:30.620
I REALLY DON'T
WANT THIS MONEY.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.241
I WISH I NEVER HAD IT,

23:32.241 --> 23:33.533
SO COULD WE
STOP TALKING ABOUT IT?

23:33.533 --> 23:36.456
WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.378
THINK OF ALL THE GOOD
THAT YOU COULD DO,

23:39.378 --> 23:41.340
LIKE FOR THE CHILDREN'S
BURN FOUNDATION EVENT

23:41.340 --> 23:43.252
THAT JO'S MOM IS DOING.

23:43.252 --> 23:45.304
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:45.304 --> 23:47.637
I'M GONNA BUY TICKETS
FOR ALL OF US.

23:47.637 --> 23:49.428
SWEET.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.470
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.851
NO, NO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:51.851 --> 23:54.183
IF I CAN DO SOMETHING GOOD,
I MIGHT AS WELL, RIGHT?

23:54.183 --> 23:56.395
THEY'RE $500 A PIECE.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.187
PUT ME DOWN FOR SIX.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.651
LADIES, GENTLEMEN,
DRESS SHARPLY.

24:04.614 --> 24:06.445
THAT WAS SO BRUCE WAYNE.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.538
- HEY.
- HI.

24:18.538 --> 24:20.379
I HAVE SO MUCH
TO SHOW YOU.

24:20.379 --> 24:22.542
ME TOO.

24:24.343 --> 24:26.215
I NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.507
I'M SORRY. I-- I--

24:27.507 --> 24:29.348
WITH ALL OF THIS
GOING ON,

24:29.348 --> 24:31.220
I'VE BEEN KIND OF...

24:32.642 --> 24:35.515
OKAY, COME HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU EVERYTHING.

24:35.515 --> 24:39.438
YOU'RE NOT UPSET?
I GOT AN "F."

24:39.438 --> 24:40.560
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

24:40.560 --> 24:41.601
I'M SURPRISED
IT'S NOT WORSE.

24:41.601 --> 24:43.523
THAN AN "F"?

24:43.523 --> 24:46.526
I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THAT
YOU WILL PULL YOUR GRADES UP.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.407
WE CAN HIRE A TUTOR.

24:48.407 --> 24:49.569
HONESTLY, AT THIS POINT,

24:49.569 --> 24:51.160
PRIVATE SCHOOL
IS AN OPTION NOW.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.161
WELL, MAYBE I CAN JUST

24:52.161 --> 24:53.533
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL
ALTOGETHER.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.454
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA
NEED A JOB AFTER GRADUATION,

24:55.454 --> 24:56.455
RIGHT?

24:56.455 --> 24:57.577
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DROP OUT.

24:57.577 --> 25:00.419
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT
I'M SO EXCITED.

25:00.419 --> 25:02.291
IT'S JUST BEEN SO LONG

25:02.291 --> 25:04.293
SINCE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO BUY ANYTHING NICE.

25:04.293 --> 25:06.425
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.

25:06.425 --> 25:08.217
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.259
THERE'S A NEW COMPUTER
FOR YOUR ROOM.

25:10.259 --> 25:14.433
AND LAPTOPS FOR,
WELL, EVERYWHERE ELSE.

25:14.433 --> 25:15.635
LOTS OF NEW CLOTHES.

25:15.635 --> 25:17.346
YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK SO HANDSOME.

25:17.346 --> 25:19.188
I'M SURE I'M GONNA
BE THE TALK OF GREENGROVE

25:19.188 --> 25:20.439
IN THIS LITTLE NUMBER.

25:20.439 --> 25:22.562
THAT IS FOR THE CHILDREN'S
BURN FOUNDATION EVENT.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.603
I HAD TO GET IT
DRY CLEANED.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.356
- YOU'RE GOING?
- WHY WOULDN'T I?

25:27.356 --> 25:29.448
YOU THREW A CASSEROLE
AT JO'S MOM.

25:29.448 --> 25:32.201
IT'S HER EVENT, SO...

25:32.201 --> 25:34.153
WELL, IF ANYONE SHOULD
BE HIDING, IT'S HER.

25:36.245 --> 25:37.416
WHAT IS THAT?

25:38.497 --> 25:40.419
OH, THIS.

25:40.419 --> 25:43.542
WELL, I WAS TRYING
TO FIND A REPLACEMENT
FOR MY WEDDING RING.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.165
AND I GOT MYSELF
ONE LITTLE TREAT.

25:46.165 --> 25:48.257
EXPENSIVE LITTLE TREAT.

25:48.257 --> 25:50.379
HONEY,
THIS MORNING, YOU SAID

25:50.379 --> 25:52.301
TO THINK OF THE MONEY
AS MY OWN.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.264
DO YOU WANT ME TO RETURN IT?
I WILL.

25:55.264 --> 25:57.516
DON'T YOU JUST THINK
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BIT WEIRD

25:57.516 --> 26:00.269
THAT, UM, WE GOT
ALL THIS STUFF

26:00.269 --> 26:01.520
BECAUSE DAD'S DEAD.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.485
DANNY, THE MAN THAT YOU
IDOLIZED NEVER EXISTED.

26:06.485 --> 26:08.608
THE REAL PERSON
WAS A TERRIBLE MAN.

26:08.608 --> 26:11.280
AND YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO FEEL GUILTY.

26:11.280 --> 26:16.285
NO REASON TO FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY?

26:16.285 --> 26:19.538
I'M JUST SAYING HE GOT
WHAT HE DESERVED, THAT'S ALL.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.295
KEEP THE BRACELET.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.548
YOU EARNED IT.

26:34.804 --> 26:35.885
( chattering )

26:35.885 --> 26:37.847
IT IS A FAILING OF
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM

26:37.847 --> 26:40.980
WHEN AN INNOCENT BOY CAN
BE JUST HOUNDED FOR WEEKS.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.144
CAROLYN AND I NEVER
THOUGHT YOU WERE GUILTY.

26:45.144 --> 26:47.026
OH, WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU NEVER SPOKE UP.

26:47.026 --> 26:48.988
DANNY REALLY COULD HAVE
USED THE SUPPORT.

26:48.988 --> 26:51.070
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.992
I'D LOVE TO HAVE
A CHAT WITH YOU

26:52.992 --> 26:54.784
ABOUT MANAGING
YOUR NEW WEALTH.

26:54.784 --> 26:57.116
I HAVE SEEN FORTUNES
JUST DWINDLE

26:57.116 --> 26:59.789
FROM BAD DECISIONS.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY?

26:59.789 --> 27:03.913
"WITH GREAT POWER COMES
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY."

27:07.206 --> 27:08.798
CALL ME.

27:08.798 --> 27:10.129
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.012
- "SIDNEY."
- WOW, SUBTLE.

27:13.012 --> 27:16.055
YEAH, AND I THOUGHT
EVERYONE AT SCHOOL WAS BAD.

27:16.055 --> 27:17.807
YOU WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE?

27:17.807 --> 27:19.138
YOU LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE.

27:21.811 --> 27:23.813
( chattering )

27:23.813 --> 27:24.934
GOD, YOUR MOM
LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.106
YEAH, SHE'S DEFINITELY
IN HER ELEMENT.

27:30.109 --> 27:31.230
HAVE YOU SEEN JO?

27:31.230 --> 27:32.902
NO, NOT YET.
WHY?

27:32.902 --> 27:34.193
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
OUR LONG-SUFFERING

27:34.193 --> 27:35.825
HOMETOWN HERO.

27:43.122 --> 27:45.835
♪ MEE, MAY, MAH ♪

27:45.835 --> 27:48.247
♪ MO, MOO ♪

27:48.247 --> 27:51.791
OKAY, GUYS, WISH ME LUCK.

27:51.791 --> 27:53.172
IT'S AUCTION TIME.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.054
( chuckles )

27:55.054 --> 27:57.056
I'M DATING AN
AUCTIONEER'S ASSISTANT.

27:57.056 --> 27:58.257
HOW COOL IS THAT?

27:58.257 --> 28:00.009
RICO, YOU KNOW MY MOM
DOES THIS EVENT

28:00.009 --> 28:01.851
LIKE EVERY YEAR.

28:01.851 --> 28:03.182
YOUR SUDDEN INTEREST
WOULDN'T HAVE

28:03.182 --> 28:05.104
ANYTHING TO DO WITH
ANDIE, WOULD IT?

28:05.104 --> 28:06.896
( chuckles )

28:06.896 --> 28:08.267
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?
DOESN'T HE USUALLY
COME TO THIS?

28:08.267 --> 28:10.069
UH, YEAH.

28:10.069 --> 28:12.231
I THINK HE'S--
HE JUST HAS WORK.

28:12.231 --> 28:14.814
WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

28:14.814 --> 28:16.235
I'M GONNA GO
GET MY BID ON.

28:18.027 --> 28:20.870
( chuckles )

28:20.870 --> 28:21.911
KID'S GOT IT BAD, HUH?

28:21.911 --> 28:23.122
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY CUTE.

28:23.122 --> 28:25.124
WE SHOULD SIT.

28:27.086 --> 28:29.128
SO DO YOU COME TO
THIS THING EVERY YEAR?

28:29.128 --> 28:32.251
YEAH. ATTENDANCE
IS KIND OF MANDATORY
AT MY HOUSE.

28:32.251 --> 28:34.173
WELL, JUST DO ME A FAVOR

28:34.173 --> 28:36.836
AND SLAP ME IF I USE
THE WRONG FORK OR SOMETHING.

28:36.836 --> 28:39.929
I AM A LITTLE
OUT OF MY ELEMENT.

28:39.929 --> 28:42.051
WHAT'S YOUR ELEMENT?

28:42.051 --> 28:44.894
AH, I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE'S AN ACTUAL NAME FOR IT,

28:44.894 --> 28:46.936
BUT A MICROWAVE
IS USUALLY INVOLVED.

28:46.936 --> 28:48.267
Tess:
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING OUT

28:48.267 --> 28:49.899
TO SUPPORT
GREENGROVE'S CHAPTER

28:49.899 --> 28:51.811
OF THE CHILDREN'S
BURN FOUNDATION.

28:51.811 --> 28:54.944
( applause )

28:54.944 --> 28:57.066
ALL OF THE ITEMS
THAT ARE UP FOR AUCTION

28:57.066 --> 28:58.778
WERE MADE BY CHILDREN
WHOSE LIVES

28:58.778 --> 29:00.239
WERE TRANSFORMED
BY YOUR DONATIONS.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.822
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

29:02.822 --> 29:05.865
ONE OF OUR MOST
DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS

29:05.865 --> 29:07.246
WHO WILL BE
PRESENTING EACH ITEM.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.869
MISS ANDIE DANG.

29:09.869 --> 29:11.961
( applause )

29:14.253 --> 29:17.837
OUR FIRST ITEM IS
A POPSICLE STICK BIRDHOUSE

29:17.837 --> 29:19.258
BY MARJORIE DICKINSON.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.971
BEAUTIFUL AND PRACTICAL.

29:21.971 --> 29:24.844
Tess: LET'S START
THE BIDDING AT...

29:24.844 --> 29:26.095
$25.

29:27.186 --> 29:29.098
25, THANK YOU, RICO.

29:29.098 --> 29:30.890
- DO WE HAVE 50?
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

29:30.890 --> 29:32.191
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
- Tess: THANK YOU.

29:32.191 --> 29:34.894
- DO WE HAVE 75?
- EXCUSE ME.

29:34.894 --> 29:37.276
75, THANK YOU.
I SEE THAT.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.898
100?

29:38.898 --> 29:40.779
- Man: YEAH.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.903
100 GOING ONCE,
GOING TWICE...

29:43.903 --> 29:46.115
SOLD FOR 100.

29:46.115 --> 29:48.247
I KNOW WHO
MOVED THE BODY.

29:49.248 --> 29:50.209
IT WAS MY MOM.

29:50.209 --> 29:51.790
DID SHE SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.042
NO, SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
IT HAS TO BE.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.083
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SENSE.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.005
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
AN AIRTIGHT THEORY.

29:56.005 --> 29:57.967
I MEAN, I KNOW
SHE DOES PILATES,

29:57.967 --> 29:59.258
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE COULD MOVE A BODY?

29:59.258 --> 30:01.260
WELL, MAYBE SHE GOT
JACK TO HELP HER.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.843
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE
EASILY FAKED THAT CAR CRASH.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.134
AND GOD KNOWS HE'S GOT
A THING FOR MY MOM.

30:05.134 --> 30:06.805
ANOTHER THING IS

30:06.805 --> 30:09.808
SHE SEEMS A LITTLE BIT
TOO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS MONEY.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.270
- IT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.853
BUT REMEMBER THAT DAY THAT
WE GOT BACK FROM THE WOODS?

30:13.853 --> 30:16.235
I NEEDED TO SEE YOUR DAD,
BUT SHE COULDN'T GET ME AWAY
QUICK ENOUGH.

30:16.235 --> 30:19.108
NOW, I TRY TO TALK TO HER,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET ME.

30:19.108 --> 30:22.031
SHE'S PROTECTING ME
FROM MYSELF

30:22.031 --> 30:23.152
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS.

30:23.152 --> 30:25.945
THEN YOU'RE SAFE.

30:25.945 --> 30:27.206
SHE WOULD
NEVER TELL ANYONE.

30:27.206 --> 30:29.208
I MIGHT BE SAFE,
BUT IF SHE GETS CAUGHT

30:29.208 --> 30:31.830
AND SHE GOES TO JAIL,
IT'S MY FAULT.

30:36.916 --> 30:38.958
Andie: AND NOW WE
MOVE ON TO A PIECE

30:38.958 --> 30:41.050
BY AHTZIN MENDOZA.

30:41.050 --> 30:43.802
AND WE'LL START
THE BIDDING AT $50.

30:45.014 --> 30:47.266
$50, THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE 100?

30:47.266 --> 30:50.099
100, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 200?

30:50.099 --> 30:51.810
THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE THREE?

30:51.810 --> 30:54.023
THANK YOU, 300.
DO WE HAVE 400?

30:54.023 --> 30:55.274
THANK YOU.

30:55.274 --> 30:56.855
DO WE HAVE FIVE?

30:57.897 --> 31:00.109
500, THANK YOU.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.031
SIX, DO WE HAVE 600?

31:02.031 --> 31:03.242
THANK YOU, SIR.

31:03.242 --> 31:05.034
SEVEN?
DO WE HAVE SEVEN?

31:05.034 --> 31:07.246
SO THAT'S 600.

31:07.246 --> 31:09.038
GOING ONCE,
GOING TWICE--

31:09.038 --> 31:10.869
$10,000.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.870
( crowd gasps, muttering )

31:11.870 --> 31:13.252
FOR DANNY DESAI.

31:17.206 --> 31:18.877
OH, IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH YOU, MOM.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.922
- ( applause )
- WOW, UH, THANK YOU.

31:25.004 --> 31:27.216
( whispering, muttering )

31:37.226 --> 31:39.398
DA-NA-NA-NA,
DA-NA-NA-NA.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.610
DID YOU FORGET?

31:41.610 --> 31:42.611
I MEAN, THAT'S--

31:42.611 --> 31:44.403
THAT'S THE PART
WHERE YOU SMILE.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.235
I JUST HAVE
A LOT ON MY MIND.

31:46.235 --> 31:48.157
DO YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

31:48.157 --> 31:49.448
IT'S COMPLICATED.

31:49.448 --> 31:52.241
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK
BECAUSE I AM COMPLICATED.

31:55.624 --> 31:58.497
IT'S JUST--

31:58.497 --> 32:01.420
IT'S JUST THERE'S ALL THESE
THINGS IN LIFE THAT YOU CAN'T...

32:01.420 --> 32:03.252
TAKE BACK.

32:03.252 --> 32:04.303
YOU KNOW?

32:04.303 --> 32:06.505
AND YOU KEEP THEM A SECRET

32:06.505 --> 32:09.638
AND YOU SAY THAT
IT'S TO PROTECT PEOPLE.

32:09.638 --> 32:11.470
- BUT--
- BUT YOU'RE ALSO
JUST SCARED.

32:11.470 --> 32:13.642
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

32:13.642 --> 32:15.514
BUT FOR ME THIS
THING HAPPENS

32:15.514 --> 32:17.606
WHERE THE SECRET,

32:17.606 --> 32:20.269
IT CAN BECOME THIS WEAPON
THAT YOU USE AGAINST YOURSELF.

32:20.269 --> 32:23.272
LIKE KEEPING IT IS
THE PUNISHMENT YOU DESERVE.

32:23.272 --> 32:26.235
YOU SOUND EXPERIENCED.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.237
DID YOU...

32:28.237 --> 32:30.369
RACK UP A LOT OF SECRETS
AT YOUR OLD SCHOOL?

32:30.369 --> 32:31.530
MORE THAN I WANTED.

32:31.530 --> 32:34.163
BUT THERE'S SOME HOPE.

32:34.163 --> 32:36.285
SEE, I DISCOVERED THAT
IF YOU

32:36.285 --> 32:37.496
STAND AROUND REALLY
DEPRESSED ABOUT IT

32:37.496 --> 32:39.578
AND YOU OBSESS OVER IT,

32:39.578 --> 32:42.291
THEN ALL OF THE BAD FEELINGS,
THEY JUST DISAPPEAR.

32:42.291 --> 32:45.344
- MM-HMM, GREAT.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:45.344 --> 32:47.386
YOU ARE MOVING
WAY TOO MUCH.

32:47.386 --> 32:48.507
YOU HAVE TO STAND
ABSOLUTELY STILL,

32:48.507 --> 32:51.220
LIKE A STATUE.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.471
FINE, WHAT ELSE AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.183
I DON'T KNOW.
LIVE.

32:54.183 --> 32:55.514
HAVE FUN.

32:55.514 --> 32:57.396
RUN THROUGH THE STREET
SCREAMING

32:57.396 --> 32:59.648
ABOUT HOW GREAT IT FEELS
TO BE ALIVE.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.271
YEAH, DO YOU
DO THAT A LOT?

33:02.271 --> 33:03.602
THE RUNNING, YES.

33:03.602 --> 33:06.275
THE SCREAMING, I MOSTLY
DO THAT IN MY HEAD.

33:07.526 --> 33:09.408
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
DO YOU WANT TO GET
OUT OF HERE?

33:09.408 --> 33:12.161
GO SOMEPLACE,
BE SPONTANEOUS.

33:12.161 --> 33:13.492
AND DO WHAT?

33:13.492 --> 33:17.166
WE COULD GO SKIP STONES
ON THE HUDSON.

33:17.166 --> 33:19.208
WE'LL MAKE IT A CONTEST.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.380
THE SHORTEST THROW BUYS
THE WINNER A MILKSHAKE.

33:22.501 --> 33:27.256
OR YOU CAN STAND AROUND,
DO THE WHOLE OBSESSING THING.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.468
SEE IF THAT
WORKS OUT FOR YOU.

33:29.468 --> 33:32.221
WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE?

33:32.221 --> 33:33.472
I WAS AN ANTISOCIAL
GIRL SCOUT.

33:33.472 --> 33:36.265
I COULD SKIP A STONE
TO MANHATTAN.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.347
WELL, THEN
LET'S SEE IT, JO.

33:38.347 --> 33:39.598
LIVE A LITTLE.

33:39.598 --> 33:41.640
FINE.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.314
JUST DON'T CRY
WHEN YOU LOSE.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.316
I HATE IT WHEN GUYS CRY.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.278
( chuckles )

33:55.154 --> 33:57.416
THIS IS SO HUGE.

33:57.416 --> 34:00.329
ONE GIFT LIKE THIS AND
THE OTHERS START POURING IN.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.501
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY AWESOME
DANNY COULD DO THAT.

34:02.501 --> 34:04.543
UM, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NOTICED.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.465
I TRIED BIDDING
ON SOME THINGS.

34:06.465 --> 34:08.427
OF COURSE I NOTICED.

34:08.427 --> 34:10.469
YOU WERE THE FIRST PADDLE
EVERY TIME.

34:10.469 --> 34:11.550
I WOULD HAVE BID MORE.
IT WAS JUST--

34:11.550 --> 34:13.302
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.594
ANYWAY, UM, EVEN THOUGH
I DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING,

34:15.594 --> 34:18.177
I THOUGHT I COULD
GIVE THIS TO YOU.

34:18.177 --> 34:20.519
IT'S JUST ALL I COULD
SCROUNGE UP ON SHORT NOTICE.

34:20.519 --> 34:22.391
IT'S LIKE $53.

34:22.391 --> 34:24.393
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

34:24.393 --> 34:25.604
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD BUY THE KIDS

34:25.604 --> 34:27.566
SOME ART SUPPLIES
FOR NEXT YEAR'S AUCTION.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.568
OR SOMETHING?

34:29.568 --> 34:32.361
IS THAT YOUR
DISAPPOINTED FACE?

34:32.361 --> 34:34.243
'CAUSE I KNOW THIS
MEANS A LOT TO YOU.

34:34.243 --> 34:35.574
AND I DEFINITELY--
I DON'T WANT TO INSULT YOU.

34:38.457 --> 34:40.499
NO, DUMMY, THAT'S...

34:40.499 --> 34:42.411
MY MOVED-ALMOST-TO-TEARS FACE.

34:42.411 --> 34:45.544
THAT'S THE SWEETEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

34:45.544 --> 34:47.416
IT IS?

34:54.263 --> 34:55.594
( both chuckle )

34:58.557 --> 35:00.429
WHY DO YOU SEEM UPSET?

35:00.429 --> 35:02.641
YOU JUST GAVE $10,000
TO A BUNCH OF NEEDY KIDS.

35:02.641 --> 35:04.433
I JUST HATED
BEING BACK THERE

35:04.433 --> 35:06.275
- WITH ALL THOSE FAKE PEOPLE.
- ( sighs )

35:06.275 --> 35:07.856
THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME, DANNY.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.438
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE THIS
FOR DAYS, EVER SINCE
YOU GOT BACK.

35:09.438 --> 35:11.190
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:11.190 --> 35:12.611
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?
- NO.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.403
WHEN YOU TOLD US
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR AUNT,

35:14.403 --> 35:15.444
THAT YOU DIDN'T KILL HER,

35:15.444 --> 35:17.326
IT SEEMED LIKE
THIS HUGE WEIGHT

35:17.326 --> 35:19.288
WAS LIFTED OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.
AND NOW IT'S LIKE--

35:19.288 --> 35:21.200
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MORE
TORTURED THAN EVER.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.502
- I'M FINE, LACEY.
- STOP SAYING YOU'RE FINE.

35:23.502 --> 35:24.503
I'M FINE!

35:27.206 --> 35:28.377
WHAT HAPPENED
WHILE YOU WERE GONE?

35:29.508 --> 35:32.251
- I CAN HELP YOU.
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T.

35:32.251 --> 35:33.552
NOT IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

35:37.256 --> 35:40.309
DANNY, YOU'RE BOTTLING UP
WHATEVER THIS IS.

35:40.309 --> 35:42.261
AND I CAN SEE
IT'S DESTROYING YOU.

35:43.352 --> 35:45.264
YOU NEED TO TELL SOMEONE.

35:47.526 --> 35:49.358
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DO.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.415
WELL, I GUESS
I'LL HEAD UP TO BED.

36:06.415 --> 36:09.248
YOU TOLD ME VIKRAM SAID

36:09.248 --> 36:10.419
SOMEONE WAS
TRYING TO KILL HIM.

36:10.419 --> 36:11.630
DO YOU KNOW WHO?

36:14.503 --> 36:16.215
YOU DON'T THINK
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.297
I DON'T KNOW.

36:21.510 --> 36:24.223
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU LIED FOR HIM,

36:24.223 --> 36:25.304
WHY YOU BELIEVED HIM.

36:25.304 --> 36:28.517
( sighs )
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

36:28.517 --> 36:30.479
KYLE, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

36:30.479 --> 36:32.651
UNTIL IT MAKES SENSE, TESS!

36:32.651 --> 36:35.444
I KNOW YOU GUYS
DATED IN HIGH SCHOOL.

36:35.444 --> 36:36.575
WERE YOU STILL IN LOVE?

36:36.575 --> 36:39.318
KYLE, IS THAT
WHAT YOU THINK?

36:40.619 --> 36:42.371
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.

36:42.371 --> 36:45.494
THE FATHER OF OUR LITTLE GIRL,
YOU'RE MY LIFE.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.247
WELL, YOU KNOW ME, TESS.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.500
I WON'T QUIT UNTIL
I FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

36:56.335 --> 36:57.466
I OWED HIM.

36:59.177 --> 37:01.510
I OWED HIM FOR EVERYTHING
I HAVE WITH YOU.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.262
WHY?

37:06.345 --> 37:08.347
BECAUSE HE NEVER
TOLD YOU MY SECRET.

37:13.352 --> 37:16.485
BEFORE JO...

37:16.485 --> 37:18.527
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.039
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
YOU'D BROKE UP WITH ME.

37:33.872 --> 37:36.134
I WAS HEARTBROKEN.

37:39.087 --> 37:42.090
I MET A GUY
AT A BAR AND...

37:43.802 --> 37:46.765
AND IT JUST FELT BETTER
THAN BEING ALONE.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.887
WELL, WHO IS HE?

37:48.887 --> 37:50.729
DO I KNOW THIS GUY?

37:50.729 --> 37:53.942
IT WAS JUST ONE NIGHT, KYLE.

37:53.942 --> 37:56.855
HE WAS LONG GONE
WHEN I FOUND OUT
I WAS PREGNANT.

37:59.858 --> 38:01.860
AND...

38:02.741 --> 38:04.703
AND I PANICKED.

38:05.113 --> 38:07.706
I WENT TO THE CLINIC...

38:08.707 --> 38:10.709
BUT I COULDN'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.963
VIKRAM HELPED ME.

38:14.963 --> 38:17.756
HE FOUND A FAMILY TO ADOPT.

38:17.756 --> 38:20.759
AND HE PAID FOR EVERYTHING.

38:20.759 --> 38:23.802
AND ALL THIS TIME,
YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO TELL ME.

38:23.802 --> 38:24.973
I WAS AFRAID.

38:24.973 --> 38:27.135
WHEN WE GOT BACK TOGETHER,

38:27.135 --> 38:29.097
IF I TOLD YOU....

38:31.019 --> 38:33.101
YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.986
AND THEN WE GOT
PREGNANT WITH JO.

38:37.986 --> 38:42.030
AND EVERY YEAR, IT GOT
A LITTLE EASIER NOT TO TELL.

38:42.030 --> 38:44.783
WHERE IS THIS CHILD?

38:44.783 --> 38:46.825
I DON'T KNOW.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.707
IT WAS A CLOSED ADOPTION.

38:48.707 --> 38:50.709
WAS IT A BOY, A GIRL?

38:50.709 --> 38:51.870
A GIRL.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.712
BUT I NEVER SAW HER.

38:53.712 --> 38:55.794
I COULDN'T.

39:03.762 --> 39:05.173
( sighs )

39:05.173 --> 39:06.805
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

39:06.805 --> 39:10.018
RIGHT NOW, I WISH
I KNEW WHAT TO SAY.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.742
WHERE DO YOU WANT
ME TO PUT THIS?

39:23.742 --> 39:25.033
OH, ANYWHERE IS FINE.

39:25.033 --> 39:28.156
$10,000, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DANNY WAS THINKING.

39:28.156 --> 39:31.159
WELL, MAYBE
HE WAS JUST TRYING

39:31.159 --> 39:32.911
TO IMPRESS THE UPPER CRUST,

39:32.911 --> 39:34.833
LIKE HIS MOTHER.

39:34.833 --> 39:35.834
WELL, I KNOW YOU
THINK IT'S SILLY,

39:35.834 --> 39:36.875
BUT I HAD TO GO.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.877
YOU KNOW, THIS TOWN
NEEDS TO KNOW

39:38.877 --> 39:41.129
THAT I'M DONE BEING
TREATED LIKE A PARIAH
AND SO IS DANNY.

39:41.129 --> 39:44.713
YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT SO SURE

39:44.713 --> 39:47.175
HE'S AS EXCITED TO REJOIN
HIGH SOCIETY AS HIS MOM.

39:47.175 --> 39:49.718
YEAH, I HATE
THAT HE'S HAVING

39:49.718 --> 39:50.809
SUCH A HARD TIME
WITH THIS.

39:52.851 --> 39:56.775
DO YOU THINK THAT THE SHOCK
IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM?

39:56.775 --> 39:58.016
HE'S A TOUGH KID.

39:58.016 --> 39:59.858
HE'LL COME AROUND.

40:02.981 --> 40:04.733
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.114
I KNOW YOU HATE
THIS KIND OF THING.

40:06.114 --> 40:07.826
DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED.

40:07.826 --> 40:09.948
YOU KNOW I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

40:12.741 --> 40:14.032
( clears throat )

40:19.037 --> 40:20.799
GOOD NIGHT, KAREN.

40:20.799 --> 40:21.960

WHAT GOT INTO YOU TONIGHT?

41:11.089 --> 41:13.091
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

41:13.091 --> 41:15.013
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
YOU'D BE IN

41:15.013 --> 41:16.725
IF YOU GOT CAUGHT?

41:16.725 --> 41:18.016
"GOT CAUGHT"?

41:18.016 --> 41:20.058
YOU CAN DROP
THE ACT, MOM.

41:20.058 --> 41:22.100
I KNOW THAT YOU ARRANGED
DAD'S LITTLE ACCIDENT.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.733
I KNOW THAT YOU MOVED
THE BODY FROM THE WOODS.

41:26.865 --> 41:28.947
I GUESS, UM...

41:28.947 --> 41:30.869
I CAN'T ACTUALLY
BE MAD AT YOU.

41:30.869 --> 41:32.030
RIGHT?

41:32.030 --> 41:34.112
BECAUSE I'M--
I'M DOING THE SAME THING.

41:34.112 --> 41:35.954
I'M LYING TO PROTECT LACEY.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.786
MUST BE IN OUR BLOOD.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.708
- DANNY, WHAT ARE YOU--
- STOP!

41:40.829 --> 41:43.962
I HAVE TO LIE
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.043
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT HERE.

41:45.043 --> 41:47.125
YOU KNOW.

41:49.087 --> 41:51.129
YOU KNOW I KILLED DAD.
