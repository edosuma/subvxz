WEBVTT

01:49.694 --> 01:54.688
Dear me, I've never seen so many long faces.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.406
It is customary to be sad at a funeral.

01:57.535 --> 02:00.493
Well, the Republic is old and infirm.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.363
Death can be a merciful release in such cases.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.865
You do not mean that.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.539
You do not believe that.

02:08.671 --> 02:11.413
You of all people shouldn't joke about tyranny.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.505
I am deadly serious.

02:13.634 --> 02:18.879
It is in all our interests to be reconciled
with Caesar now, for the good of Rome.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.840
The good of Rome, indeed.

02:22.727 --> 02:26.561
As soon as this...farce is done,
I shall retire to the country

02:26.689 --> 02:29.897
and wait for the city to come to its senses.

02:30.026 --> 02:32.608
It is the only honourable thing to do.

02:32.737 --> 02:36.195
My dear friend, we have no honour.

02:36.324 --> 02:41.068
If we had honour, we would be
with Cato and Scipio in the afterlife.

03:10.483 --> 03:15.728
The Senate will hear Marcus Tullius Cicero.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.241
On this eve of his most glorious triumph,

03:26.874 --> 03:30.867
I move that Gaius Julius Caesar
be made lmperator

03:31.003 --> 03:37.249
and granted absolute power over Rome
for a period of ten years.

04:03.536 --> 04:08.280
As some of you know,
Caesar and l have had our disagreements.

04:17.091 --> 04:21.676
However that may be, he has shown himself

04:21.804 --> 04:27.674
to be as wise and merciful in victory
as he was invincible in battle.

04:29.270 --> 04:34.981
Let this be an end to division and civil strife.

04:35.818 --> 04:42.940
l willingly pledge my loyalty to him
and I urge you all to do the same.

04:43.075 --> 04:50.197
l heartily commend the motion proposed
by Marcus Tullius Cicero.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.549
The motion is carried unanimously.

05:17.943 --> 05:22.983
Many of you here today fought against me.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.107
Many of you wished me dead.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.325
Many of you perhaps still do.

05:29.580 --> 05:34.165
But I hold no grudges and seek no revenge.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.294
I demand only this...

05:40.549 --> 05:46.545
that you join with me in building a new Rome...

05:47.556 --> 05:53.517
a Rome that offers justice,
peace and land to all its citizens,

05:53.646 --> 05:56.262
not just the privileged few.

05:56.398 --> 06:02.064
Support me in this task
and old divisions will be forgotten.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.233
Oppose me...

06:06.700 --> 06:09.533
and Rome will not forgive you a second time.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.572
Senators...

06:19.755 --> 06:21.586
the war is over.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.048
Domina.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.712
Atia of the Julii is here.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.929
Atia?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.723
Here now.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.063
She wishes to see you.

07:21.191 --> 07:25.935
Atia...in my house?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.701
My dear Atia.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.496
How lovely to see you.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.460
My poor friend.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.303
What have they done to you?

08:00.439 --> 08:03.351
You're so sweet. Come sit down.

08:05.819 --> 08:11.405
I'm very sorry I haven't visited sooner
but I was far too upset to face seeing you.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.070
The very idea, it's too sinister.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.411
A noblewoman stripped naked
and beaten on the streets.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.621
Horrible. Horrible.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.741
Tell me truly, how are you now?

08:21.877 --> 08:24.163
l'm recovering very well.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.703
Have they found the culprits?

08:26.882 --> 08:30.340
They have not but justice
will find them eventually.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.551
I'm quite sure of that.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.391
Will you have some lemon water?

08:37.810 --> 08:40.051
That would be lovely.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.190
— Brutus is well, I hope.
- He is.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.731
It's so wise of him to choose
submission to my dear uncle.

08:50.656 --> 08:55.070
l was very afraid he might try
some foolish act of bravery.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.411
Men are so silly about their honour. No?

09:02.793 --> 09:07.378
I've come to ask you
if you will sit with me at the triumph.

09:07.506 --> 09:12.466
Even though I'm being besieged by sycophants
asking for space, I thought no,

09:12.594 --> 09:16.462
if someone were to have first choice,
it should be my dear friend Servilia

09:16.598 --> 09:19.806
who's been through so much pain.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.768
That is very thoughtful of you...

09:24.314 --> 09:26.930
but I think I shall not be well enough.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.766
Well, that's a pity.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.484
— Are you sure?
— I am.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.696
— Well, if you change your mind...
- I will let you know.

09:37.119 --> 09:42.204
People tell me that Octavia's left the city
but no one knows where.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.459
I hope there's nothing amiss.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.787
Not at all. She's staying
at my cousin's villa in Paestum,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.915
mooning over some young fool
of a poet she's met there.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.508
She'll be back in time for the triumph.

10:17.409 --> 10:21.277
Brother. What are you doing here?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.199
I've come to take you home.

10:23.332 --> 10:26.290
— This is my home.
— This? This is not your home.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.909
I'm happy here.

10:30.714 --> 10:35.799
I don't believe you. In any case,
your place is with your family.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.714
Bad enough to run away.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.464
But to these people?
This isn't the healthy way of life.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.807
You call our family healthy?

10:43.936 --> 10:46.894
Our corruption stinks
in the nostrils of Mother Earth.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.638
This is your foreign priests talking.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.776
They're frauds. They only want your money.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.647
Priests are nobody.
They're just servants here.

10:57.783 --> 11:02.026
This is the Great Mother's house.
The Great Mother wants nothing from me.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.370
— I'm a worm in her sight.
— You are not a worm.

11:05.499 --> 11:11.335
You are a daughter of the Julii.
It looks very ill, you running away like this.

11:11.463 --> 11:15.797
Reflects badly on the whole family
if it were known publicly.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.845
For a moment I thought you wanted me back
because you missed me.

11:20.973 --> 11:24.761
Don't be silly. We've missed you terribly.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.511
Your mother has missed you.
Even the servants and animals have.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.104
And you?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.692
And |.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.780
I've missed you.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.708
I can't go back.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.620
What's done is done.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.494
I forgive you. Your mother forgives you.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.834
You forgive me? Mother forgives me?

11:59.970 --> 12:01.210
What if I don't forgive?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.213
Whatever you think she may have done,

12:04.349 --> 12:08.934
consider the possibility
she did it out of love for you.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.472
I'll never forgive her.

12:10.606 --> 12:14.474
Be that as it may,
your forgiveness is irrelevant.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.020
You must come home.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.572
I'm sorry.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.938
I will not.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.075
I don't want to use force.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.989
The priests will protect me.

12:28.332 --> 12:32.371
They won't. I've bought them.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.367
Quite cheaply.

12:35.797 --> 12:39.210
I beg you, let me stay here.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.963
What have you done?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.142
Fellow citizens of the Aventine!

12:58.737 --> 13:00.944
Fellow citizens!

13:03.700 --> 13:06.237
Fellow citizens of the Aventine!

13:09.665 --> 13:11.621
My name is Lucius Vorenus,

13:11.750 --> 13:14.958
tribe of Stellatina, veteran of the 13th Legion.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.373
Some of you may know me.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.131
I bring you good news.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.751
Caesar has put an end to patrician tyranny

13:24.888 --> 13:28.096
and will ensure
that the common people be heard once more.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.762
Go back to Gaul, ginger knob.

13:33.105 --> 13:37.690
I'll not deny it, l have a Gallic look about me
but I'm as solid Roman as you are.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.818
l've shed blood for Rome.
My father shed blood for Rome.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.313
As did his father and his father before him.

13:44.449 --> 13:48.362
My wife. ..my wife
was born here in the Aventine!

13:48.495 --> 13:51.578
I am as solid a Roman as any man here!

13:55.377 --> 14:00.917
If I am elected as your local magistrate,
I promise on Jupiter's stone

14:01.049 --> 14:07.466
to strive to make this an era of peace,
prosperity and justice for all Aventine.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.216
Tomorrow Caesar holds a triumph,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.934
a symbol of his love
for the people of Rome.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.554
- Cack!
— Why don't you shut up, you...

14:17.691 --> 14:19.682
Ladylike, madam, ladylike.

14:19.818 --> 14:23.356
Five days of feasting and games
as appreciation

14:23.488 --> 14:27.026
for the trust and support
the people of Rome have given Caesar.

14:27.159 --> 14:32.825
Freedom, more like! We've given him
our freedom and our honour!

14:32.956 --> 14:38.121
I would not be standing here on Caesar's slate
if I did not believe, if I did not know,

14:38.253 --> 14:42.917
that he has only the Republic's
best interests at heart.

14:46.928 --> 14:50.841
A new era. Tomorrow's triumph, a new era.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.307
With tomorrow's triumph, a new era begins.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.974
For all Aventine. For all Rome.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.439
— It was good. You did well.
— Thank you.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.092
King of all the Gauls.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.720
Makes you think, doesn't it?

15:34.476 --> 15:36.558
It does.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.810
Goodbye, old friend.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.319
Do your best to tidy him up.
He looks dead already.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.999
Found you at last, you bastards.
Been through the whole army.

16:51.136 --> 16:55.379
The famous Titus Pullo. To what do we owe
this honour? You come to wish us luck?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.723
Listen, I've got most of my kit
but I've lost my crest.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.264
Surely someone's got a spare, you think?

17:04.274 --> 17:06.265
It's not like I lost my sword.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.110
You can't march with us. You left the Legion.
You signed yourself out.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.479
I know, but...13th forever...

17:12.616 --> 17:15.198
lt's enlisted men only. You're a civilian.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.123
I saved your skin.
Shouldn't have to remind you of that.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.913
If you want to sign up, that's a different story.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.412
You can march with us till your feet are nubs.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.416
— Haven't l spilled enough blood for the 13th?
— Don't be like that.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.885
I don't fucking make the rules, do |?
I follow them.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.380
lt's enlisted men only. Don't push it.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.392
If you come by after,
I'll stand you some drinks...

17:42.520 --> 17:47.810
Stand me some drinks? I've got better things
to do than go drinking with the likes of you.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.559
Well, walk on then, citizen.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.276
Walk on!

17:53.406 --> 17:58.275
Right, ladies, on your feet!
Time to look like soldiers!

18:10.799 --> 18:12.664
Is this too much?

18:12.801 --> 18:15.668
— Just enough, I'd say.
- I don't know.

18:15.804 --> 18:20.343
I think it's too purple. I want to suggest purple
without actually wearing it.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.182
It will look less loud in direct light.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.724
— What do you think?
— Jupiter in life.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.313
Resemblance is uncanny.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.814
What do you find amusing?

18:35.907 --> 18:38.569
lt's absurd, isn't it?

18:38.702 --> 18:41.569
Dressing up, playing at being God?

18:41.705 --> 18:45.823
Playing? I'm not playing.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.790
This is not a game.

18:50.547 --> 18:54.165
As you wish. It is not a game.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.968
Something more red.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.718
— Is the canal around the circus filled?
— It is.

19:02.851 --> 19:06.059
- It was not last night.
— I saw to it at first light.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.725
Good. Make sure the elephants are
given their emetics in good time.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.770
I don't want my chariot slowed by giant turds.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.908
You are looking much better.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.700
I am not better, however.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.457
Well, I must get you
out to the country, perhaps.

19:29.586 --> 19:33.829
Some fresh air and sunshine
would do you good.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.925
This lying abed is not healthy.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.841
l rise when l have reason to do so.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.302
Don't loiter here
pretending to be solicitous.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.222
Go to your friend's obscene display.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.350
Mother...

19:57.781 --> 19:59.897
Go.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.164
Go.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.912
Do you want some colour on your cheeks?

21:10.687 --> 21:13.975
Please, darling, say something.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.318
This horrid silent business, it's most upsetting.

21:22.532 --> 21:26.024
— What did they do to you?
— They did nothing.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.321
She speaks. Here's a start.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.281
They were very kind to me.

21:33.418 --> 21:38.128
Kind enough to let you hack away
at yourself like a side of pork.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.046
My poor little grump.

21:45.889 --> 21:51.179
I didn't realise until now how much I missed
your gloomy presence around the place.

22:19.422 --> 22:23.631
Domina, there's a beggar at the door
who says he is Quintus,

22:23.760 --> 22:25.341
natural son of Pompey.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.303
He asks for your son's protection.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.296
Send him away.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.884
— Take your hands off me!
- Get out!

22:34.020 --> 22:36.181
Brutus!

22:36.314 --> 22:40.933
Scared to talk to me, coward?
You're a coward, Brutus!

22:41.069 --> 22:46.154
I swear by Janus, Jupiter and Juno...

22:46.282 --> 22:49.490
I swear on the grave of my father,

22:49.619 --> 22:53.862
l, Quintus Valerius Pompey,

22:53.998 --> 22:56.785
I'm going to kill that son of a whore tyrant!

22:56.918 --> 22:59.876
I'll get Ajax to deal with him.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.962
Wait.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.107
Pompey's natural son?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.602
lam.

23:25.738 --> 23:29.572
I gather at least you're still no friend to Caesar.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.363
l'll burn him alive.

23:32.495 --> 23:36.454
— I will pluck out his eyes...
- Be calm.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.416
You're among friends.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.840
All will be well.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.904
Have him washed and fed.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.593
Glorious Caesar!

30:15.982 --> 30:21.898
Tables for 5,000 men
will be set up in the cattle forum.

30:22.029 --> 30:26.819
Slaves and freedmen are not eligible.

30:26.951 --> 30:31.911
Those citizens that cannot find
a proper seating place must leave

30:32.039 --> 30:35.076
when ordered by the civic officers.

30:35.209 --> 30:42.251
Gaius Julius Caesar has decreed,
in tribute to their virtue,

30:42.383 --> 30:47.719
each and every citizen of Rome
will be issued from the public treasury

30:47.847 --> 30:51.760
the sum of 100 denarii.

30:53.936 --> 31:01.104
Further, 20,000 deserving families
will be given farms

31:01.235 --> 31:04.398
on the public lands around Capua.

31:06.032 --> 31:11.743
Further, for the coming year, all rents...al| rents

31:11.871 --> 31:16.456
on low dwellings in the city will be paid in full

31:16.584 --> 31:19.917
by Gaius Julius Caesar.

31:20.421 --> 31:25.711
Very noble and very nicely expressed,
if I may say so.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.708
Might I have a quiet word?

31:27.845 --> 31:30.131
Of course.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.800
A quiet word.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.216
You may speak in front of Quintus.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.559
As you wish. It is of Quintus I speak.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.430
The good man has been here
several days now.

31:40.566 --> 31:45.060
Perhaps he grows weary
of entertaining us with his happy presence.

31:45.196 --> 31:48.484
Do not mind him, Quintus.
He has no manners.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.317
He shall stay as long as it pleases me.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.035
Well, that's the thing, Mother.

31:55.164 --> 32:00.124
I do not see in what way
he could possibly please you.

32:00.252 --> 32:05.497
What is his purpose?
Does he help you to write poetry?

32:05.633 --> 32:08.420
— He has a good ear.
-|ndeed?

32:08.552 --> 32:13.842
— You surprise me.
— He has fire in him. It warms me.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.465
Light more lamps if you are cold!

32:17.269 --> 32:20.761
It looks very ill to keep
a son of Pompey in our house.

32:20.898 --> 32:24.356
And we should strike
such fine figures othenNise!

32:34.912 --> 32:40.623
So you see, the fourth clause of the previous statute
only applies in cases of fire and flood,

32:40.751 --> 32:42.992
unless stipulated in the appendix.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.120
— Do you see?
- Not clearly.

32:45.256 --> 32:49.374
I'm not sure I can
explain it in simpler terms.

32:49.510 --> 32:53.753
Can it wait until after the election?
There's no point learning all this if I lose.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.595
You will not lose.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.682
You're very sure of that.
There are other candidates.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.595
I warned you about mocking me.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.939
Forgive me, sir. I had thought
you understood the system.

33:06.068 --> 33:10.027
The other candidates are straw men.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.021
Straw men?

33:12.366 --> 33:15.449
It saves a lot of useless strife
if there's no opposition

33:15.578 --> 33:19.867
but it would look ill if Caesar's man
was the only one standing.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.617
These facts disturb you somehow?

33:24.753 --> 33:27.961
The elections are sanctioned
by Jupiter Capitolinus.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.546
They are sacred.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.758
Caesar also is sanctioned by Jupiter,
is he not?

33:32.887 --> 33:37.381
By augury, by triumph,
by acclaim of the people.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.516
Anything he does is sacred.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.897
In a way, he is a demigod.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.230
For one day only.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.940
For the rest, he is
a mortal man like you and me.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.446
Mortal or not, he is trying to save the Republic.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.608
By corrupting the elections?

33:53.741 --> 33:58.451
The Roman people are not crying out for
clean elections. They're crying out forjobs.

33:58.579 --> 34:03.414
They're crying out for clean water,
for food, for stability and peace.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.784
You can do great things for your people.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.913
You can help save the Republic.

34:14.261 --> 34:17.753
Or you can go back to your shop
and resume selling mutton and pig,

34:17.890 --> 34:20.802
have dirty hands but a clean conscience.

34:30.361 --> 34:32.443
So what do you say?

34:34.406 --> 34:37.648
— Say to what?
— You haven't heard a word I've been saying.

34:37.785 --> 34:39.696
Is everything all right?

34:39.828 --> 34:41.955
Forgive me.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.287
So what was it you needed?

34:48.295 --> 34:52.504
I want to free Eirene, take her off
to the country, if you'll lend me some money.

34:52.633 --> 34:55.466
- Of course.
— And come with me to the slave registry.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.836
— To vouch your name for my ownership.
— Why are you freeing her?

34:58.973 --> 35:01.885
— Can't marry her othenNise.
- Marry her?

35:04.645 --> 35:06.510
Look,Fve”.

35:06.647 --> 35:12.813
I've been feeling strange and low
and empty these last months and...

35:14.947 --> 35:18.189
Anyway, I've puzzled it out
and I realised what it was.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.734
I love Eirene.

35:21.870 --> 35:26.330
I love her and I want her to bear
my children and be my wife and...

35:31.630 --> 35:34.463
Congratulations, I suppose.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.798
So you'll be going to the country, you say?

35:41.348 --> 35:44.966
— Leaving Rome?
— Rome's no place for me.

35:45.102 --> 35:47.684
I need clean air, room to move.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.475
And what will you do when you get there?

35:50.607 --> 35:53.690
There's always work
for a good man with a sword.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.652
Well, as long as you're sure.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.742
I've thought it through.

36:00.868 --> 36:03.735
I've never been so sure of anything in my life.

36:05.164 --> 36:09.828
I'm happy for you. I hope you find your path.

36:16.050 --> 36:20.589
Still here? I thought you were retiring
to the country as a point of honour.

36:20.721 --> 36:22.257
You do right to mock me.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.596
You make me feel small.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.933
Ajoke, old man, ajoke.
I'm always happy for your company.

36:28.062 --> 36:31.099
So, why didn't you tell me beforehand?

36:31.231 --> 36:35.440
— I could have been of assistance, perhaps.
- What are you talking about?

36:35.569 --> 36:38.106
Everyone is reading it!

36:38.238 --> 36:41.071
I saw some temple prostitutes with a copy.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.941
"A call to virtue."

36:44.078 --> 36:47.616
The writing is adequate,
which is something we should talk about,

36:47.748 --> 36:50.956
but the sentiments
are full of grace and bravery.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.667
"Sons of the Republic,
the blood of our forefathers

36:53.796 --> 36:56.378
"calls you to honour the memory
and emulate the deeds

36:56.507 --> 36:59.715
"of Porcius Cato, the last true Roman."

36:59.843 --> 37:01.834
Who wrote this?

37:01.970 --> 37:04.097
You did.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.519
Gods beneath us!

37:12.648 --> 37:14.730
Mother!

37:15.692 --> 37:20.356
Mother, have you seen this? This lunacy?

37:20.489 --> 37:23.071
Of course I've seen it. It's not lunacy.

37:23.200 --> 37:28.866
It is a cogent defence of Republican principles
against the forces of tyranny.

37:30.416 --> 37:35.627
— I am rather proud of it.
— You wrote this? In my name?

37:35.754 --> 37:39.622
Cassius contributed
several nice turns of phrase.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.749
You know Cassius, of course.

37:41.885 --> 37:44.752
Of course. Delighted.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.797
Quintus.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.846
— lt's lovely to see you again. It's been too long.
-|ndeed.

37:51.979 --> 37:56.643
You will excuse me if I speak
with my mother privately?

38:04.158 --> 38:08.527
I'm deeply sorry you feel I have failed you
but this is going too far.

38:08.662 --> 38:11.074
My name is not yours to be used...

38:11.206 --> 38:14.915
You haven't failed me.
You can't fail me, I'm your mother.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.501
— You have failed the Republic.
- Dear gods!

38:19.590 --> 38:21.376
Bring me a pen and paper.

38:21.508 --> 38:27.504
It's bad enough that you keep that little
madman Quintus in this house, but this!

38:30.684 --> 38:32.140
I don't know what to tell him.

38:32.269 --> 38:35.932
Why don't you fall on your knees
and kiss his feet and beg for mercy?

38:36.064 --> 38:38.521
— lt served you in the past.
- But not you.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.027
Perhaps you did not beg hard enough.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.205
You do understand...

39:02.341 --> 39:05.378
he might have me killed for this?

39:09.139 --> 39:12.802
Rome has fallen into
the hands of a corrupt monster.

39:12.935 --> 39:19.306
You, direct descendant
of the father of the Republic,

39:19.441 --> 39:21.727
what do you do?

39:28.450 --> 39:30.441
What would you have me do?

39:30.577 --> 39:32.363
What would your father have done?

39:32.496 --> 39:36.364
What would his father have done?
Would they bend their knees to a tyrant?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.663
They would take account
of the specific circumstan...

39:39.795 --> 39:43.003
They would chase him
out of the city like any mad dog.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.258
Chased him out?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.842
And how am | to do that, exactly?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.097
You would not be alone.

39:51.223 --> 39:55.432
These fine men in the house are very good.
I am reassured.

39:55.561 --> 40:00.555
They are good men and there are many others,
men of rank and wisdom.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.604
It is no dog gone mad.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.694
I would rather be mad than disgrace our name.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.280
No more!

40:10.951 --> 40:17.117
You send your fool henchmen away
and forget this insanity.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.997
— Brutus.
— Cassius, it's lovely to see you.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.919
But, as you can see...

40:28.051 --> 40:32.545
Of course, forgive the intrusion.
Perhaps I may visit another time.

40:32.681 --> 40:34.842
Good. Certainly.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.305
On Jupiter's stone, you're a Roman citizen

40:39.479 --> 40:42.266
and you attest this man's
ownership of listed property?

40:42.399 --> 40:44.481
lam. ldo.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.813
Sign here.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.573
Any kind of mark will do.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.364
I can write my name as good as the next man.

41:04.755 --> 41:06.837
Done.

41:07.841 --> 41:10.503
42. 42 up.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.556
Eirene.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.849
Come over here. I want to talk to you.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.524
I'll leave you to it.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.032
I've been to the registrar.
You're no longer my slave.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.745
You've sold me? Please don't sell me.
Don't send me away. I beg you.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.330
I'm setting you free.

41:43.085 --> 41:45.952
You're free. It says so here.

41:48.965 --> 41:53.709
Thank you. Thank you.
You're the kindest man alive.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.047
I love you, sir. I love you, sir.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.390
Here. Here. It's a dress.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.807
Go try it on. Let's see how it looks.

42:26.253 --> 42:29.461
Titus Pullo, sir. I cannot thank you enough.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.966
Thank me?
What are you thanking me for, boy?

42:32.092 --> 42:35.300
For freeing her. We have been
saving to buy our freedom,

42:35.429 --> 42:38.637
but we never...to happen so soon.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.505
I cannot tell you what a gift it is.

42:40.642 --> 42:42.473
You've been saving? You and Eirene?

42:42.602 --> 42:45.685
We thought to take the Vorenus name
when we became freedmen

42:45.814 --> 42:51.775
but Eirene says it must be under your name
she becomes my wife.

42:54.614 --> 42:55.990
Wife?

42:56.116 --> 43:00.155
Legal wife, I mean.
We are already married in our hearts.

43:00.287 --> 43:02.949
Eirene? My Eirene?

43:03.081 --> 43:06.869
Sir? Sir!

43:35.739 --> 43:38.321
- Dead?
— Looks like.

43:38.450 --> 43:41.112
- What happened?
— I killed him. I did it.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.906
I can see that, but why?
Why did you do this?

43:44.039 --> 43:46.200
— It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

43:46.333 --> 43:49.791
It matters to me. This boy was my property.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.286
— He angered me.
— He angered you?

43:52.422 --> 43:54.287
He and Eirene, they were...

43:55.842 --> 43:58.800
So what does that matter?
Did you think she was a virgin?

43:58.929 --> 44:01.545
She's still yours to use as you wish.

44:01.681 --> 44:04.468
- I love her.
— This is how you prove it?

44:04.601 --> 44:07.809
This is no charnel house
to kill people as you want.

44:07.938 --> 44:10.680
This is my home. My home!

44:14.110 --> 44:17.238
You do this violence before my children?

44:17.364 --> 44:19.195
I'm sorry.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.951
Silence!

44:24.955 --> 44:27.571
I'll pay you back.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.698
Pay me back with what, you damn fool?

44:29.835 --> 44:32.577
You've got no money but what I've given you.

44:32.712 --> 44:34.839
But please...

44:36.591 --> 44:40.254
- Do not call me a fool.
— I'll call you what I like. You're a damn fool.

44:40.387 --> 44:44.596
I don't care about the money.
It's...the disrespect.

44:44.724 --> 44:48.433
Look at what you did! Look at him!

44:48.562 --> 44:52.521
Maybe you're right. Probably am a fool.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.277
Never was a clever one like you.

44:56.403 --> 44:59.440
Never demoted, you,
never flogged, never locked up.

44:59.573 --> 45:01.780
Straight to the top.

45:01.908 --> 45:06.493
And here you are,
with your nice, clean, white toga.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.452
Lovely cloth, that.

45:08.582 --> 45:12.245
Stays clean no matter
how much you wade in the filth.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.838
— Speak your mind.
- As you will.

45:15.964 --> 45:19.081
Time was, you said Caesar
was a rebel and a traitor.

45:20.635 --> 45:23.126
And now he tosses
you some coin and some farmland

45:23.263 --> 45:27.882
and he's saviour of the Republic
and you're kissing his royal arse.

45:29.185 --> 45:33.303
You stand up. Stand up! Stand up!

45:34.399 --> 45:36.515
Hlnotﬁghtyou.

45:39.029 --> 45:42.772
Then go. Go and do not come back here.

45:51.958 --> 45:55.075
Go! And do not come back here.

45:55.211 --> 45:57.668
Eirene, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:02.344 --> 46:04.551
Stay away from her.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.761
Right.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.682
Sorry.

46:15.649 --> 46:17.185
I had no idea.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.478
I must go now.

46:19.653 --> 46:22.269
You do believe me?

46:22.405 --> 46:25.943
My dear friend, of course I believe you.
You've never lied to me.

46:26.076 --> 46:28.783
Why would you put your name
to a thing and then deny it?

46:28.912 --> 46:30.823
Well, exactly.

46:30.956 --> 46:35.620
And anyone may forge
my name to a thing to give it weight.

46:35.752 --> 46:38.494
We shall just have
to become used to it, no doubt.

46:38.630 --> 46:41.713
I wonder who it was that wrote it.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.709
I wish I knew.

46:45.845 --> 46:50.635
Someone of talent. Anyhow,
I've seldom seen a bad case so well put.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.348
I shall have to write a reply.

46:52.477 --> 46:56.390
As long as you and I know where we stand.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.354
Where do we stand?

46:59.776 --> 47:02.518
I hope we are the best of friends. Are we?

47:02.654 --> 47:04.064
We are, we are.

47:04.197 --> 47:08.861
Brutus, I have never doubted
your friendship or fidelity.

47:10.912 --> 47:13.028
Even when we were enemies.

49:56.786 --> 50:00.825
Titus Pullo. You look tired, my friend.

50:00.957 --> 50:05.166
— I'm drunk.
— These are hard times for war veterans.

50:05.295 --> 50:09.163
- You're right there.
— Too many soldiers back in Rome.

50:09.299 --> 50:12.791
Not enough work to go round.
It's a sad situation.

50:12.927 --> 50:18.012
But it's a crime to see
a man of your ability unemployed.

50:20.143 --> 50:22.225
I'm doing fine.

50:23.396 --> 50:25.387
I have plenty of irons in the fire.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.724
Well, if your prospects don't work out,

50:28.860 --> 50:33.775
you can ask on any street in the Aventine
for Erastes Fulmen.

50:33.907 --> 50:36.239
I will always have a job for you.

50:37.702 --> 50:39.863
I'm a soldier, not a murderer.

50:41.122 --> 50:45.081
These days, Pullo,
is there really any difference?

50:48.254 --> 50:52.463
Have a drink on me.
When you've sobered up, come and see me.

50:52.592 --> 50:54.674
We'll talk a little business.
