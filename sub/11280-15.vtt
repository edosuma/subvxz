CHRIS ROCK:
When I was 14,

00:06.474 --> 00:08.676
it seemed like
all I did was work.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.579
I worked at school.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.481
* We're not scared
to lose at all *

00:13.514 --> 00:15.283
* Security throw
through the wall *

00:15.316 --> 00:17.351
"Four score and seven years ago,
our forefathers

00:17.385 --> 00:19.520
"brought forth from this
continent a new nation,

00:19.553 --> 00:22.090
"conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition

00:22.123 --> 00:23.624
that all men are created equal."

00:23.657 --> 00:25.659
I worked at home.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.397
* Unless we're clinging
to the things we prize *

00:29.430 --> 00:33.601
* And do you feel scared?
I do *

00:33.634 --> 00:37.471
Sometimes I even
went sleep-working.

00:37.505 --> 00:43.277
* And if we threw it all away

00:43.311 --> 00:46.547
* Things can only get better

00:48.449 --> 00:52.820
But the one thing I always did
for fun was go to the movies.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.256
Man, did you see Purple Rain?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.757
Yes!

00:56.790 --> 00:58.592
"Why don't you stay awhile,
see how it's done?"

01:00.661 --> 01:01.762
Man, did you see Rambo?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.597
Yeah.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.533
"Do we get to win
this time, sir?"

01:06.667 --> 01:08.702
Man, did you see
Beverly Hills Cop?

01:11.239 --> 01:14.342
"Here, why don't you go
ahead and take this banana?"

01:14.375 --> 01:17.578
The one big movie I missed
was Ghostbusters.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.380
"I got slimed."

01:19.413 --> 01:20.881
"Man, that chick is toast."

01:20.914 --> 01:22.883
Are they still talking
about Ghostbusters?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.553
Yeah. It's only the biggest
movie out this year.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.288
I can't believe
you haven't seen it.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.522
Have you seen it?
No.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.158
Well, then what are
you talking about?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.159
I thought you
saw everything.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.460
I kept missing it.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.162
Now the only place
it's still playing

01:34.195 --> 01:35.229
is the dollar theater.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.797
But popcorn still
cost eight bucks.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.632
And this is the last week.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.168
Maybe we can
catch it on Saturday.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.369
It leaves Thursday.
Forget it.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.836
We'll just have
to see it

01:42.870 --> 01:44.672
when it comes out on
video in four years.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.873
Back then, that was quick.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.841
I'm not waiting four years.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.778
Class...

01:50.811 --> 01:51.612
I just want to let you know
that I won't be here tomorrow

01:51.645 --> 01:53.547
because I have
a funeral to attend.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.249
Who died?

01:55.283 --> 01:57.818
My sister.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.353
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.621
Thank you, Chris.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.923
It's hard because I don't have

02:02.956 --> 02:05.759
19 or 20 other siblings
like you.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.397
What'd she die of?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.532
She died of a bad case
of grammar.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.170
Watch those prepositions.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.905
Greg, you know what?

02:17.938 --> 02:20.274
I think we can go
see this movie.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.343
Well, how are we
going to do that?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.711
Cut school.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.214
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.290
* Aw, make it funky now!

CHRIS ROCK:
In my neighborhood,

03:01.515 --> 03:03.384
most kids' parents
didn't get involved at school,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.853
so whenever my mother
had the time, she would.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.888
I'm coming up
to your school tomorrow

03:07.921 --> 03:09.557
to help out with the book fair.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.459
Are you going to help
at my bookmark table?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.526
I'll try, baby.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.595
When are you coming?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.597
Around 9:00. Why?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.932
Oh... nothing.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
No "nothing." What's wrong?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.971
Well, I just don't want you

03:24.004 --> 03:25.673
calling me "sweetie"
and stuff like that.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.874
Last time you came,

03:26.907 --> 03:28.776
people made fun
of me for a week.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.711
Why don't you just
call him Joe Rockhead?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.513
That's what all
my friends call him.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.948
That's 'cause your friends
smell like hot toilet bowls.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.718
You smell like underarm
and booty crack.
Hey, stop it.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.019
We're eating.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.388
Well, don't worry, Drew.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.323
I won't do anything
to embarrass you.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.624
Thank you, Mom.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.326
Because I was planning
to cut school,

03:45.359 --> 03:46.494
I was acting guiltier

03:46.527 --> 03:48.462
than Michael Richards
at an NAACP meeting.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.331
Chris, when can I come
up to your school?

03:50.364 --> 03:51.499
Not tomorrow.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.301
Um, not tomorrow.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.436
Nothing's going on,
anyway.
I wasn't asking
about tomorrow.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.404
Just in general.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.638
I know, I'm just saying

03:57.671 --> 03:58.972
that nothing's
going on tomorrow.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.708
What, are you embarrassed
about me, too?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.444
No, I'm not embarrassed.
Then what's
your problem?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.646
I don't have a problem.
Then why can't I
come up to your school?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.915
You can come up to the school,
just not tomorrow.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.517
Well, what's the big deal
about tomorrow?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.551
Nothing-- that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.052
That's not what I asked you.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.054
I know, I'm just saying that
tomorrow nothing's going on.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.323
Then why are you making
a federal case out of it?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.790
I'm not.
You are.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.659
Mom, when you can come up to
the school, I'll let you know.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.760
Okay.
Okay.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.961
That went well.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.030
Okay, um...

04:23.063 --> 04:25.399
Daddy, can you come up
to our school, too?

04:25.433 --> 04:28.035
No, baby, I have to renew
my driver's license tomorrow.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.970
Baby, I thought you
did that already.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.506
Mm-mm.
A new license costs 17.50.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.343
And I'm not giving them people
my money until I have to.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.878
My father waited until
the last possible moment

04:37.911 --> 04:40.581
to pay for everything--
and I mean everything.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.485
Your meter's only
got a minute left.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.554
When that quarter runs out,
I'll put in this one.

04:48.088 --> 04:52.092
Baby, you're almost out of gas.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.896
When that gas runs out,
I'll put in some new gas.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.932
Push.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.535
Push.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.804
Julius, would you just
pay the man, please?!

05:03.837 --> 05:05.673
Push.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.908
When the baby's all the way out,
I'll give him all the money.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.983
Well, you better
get up there early

05:16.016 --> 05:17.050
'cause you know
how those lines are.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.487
Yeah, I'm going to be there
when the door opens.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.655
I'm going to take my picture,
pay my 17.50

05:21.689 --> 05:22.990
and be back home by 9:00.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.026
While my father
was trying to cut costs,

05:26.059 --> 05:28.396
I was trying to cut class.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.030
Man, this is going
to be so cool.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.500
Wait, you never
cut school before?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.602
I've had perfect attendance
since kindergarten.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.970
Well, listen, if you don't
want to do this, I understand.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.672
I wouldn't want
to mess up your record.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.508
Nah, it's cool.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.943
Who knew that in the future
this one unexplained absence

05:42.976 --> 05:44.745
would keep Greg
from getting into Harvard?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.080
If we get caught, I can just
say it was your fault.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.717
Same thing happened
to Colin Powell.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.753
The only thing I'm worried about
is, what if people miss us?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.054
Like who?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.756
They only person
that'll miss you is me.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.090
The only person that'll
miss me is you.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.926
Things aren't
much different now.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.162
What about when
they take attendance?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.465
Oh, I got Pedro to cover for us.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.568
Chris.
Aqui.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.003
Meanwhile, my father
was there bright and early

06:10.037 --> 06:11.805
to beat the line at the DMV.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.177
Too late.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.112
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

06:19.146 --> 06:21.148
I'm going to renew my license.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.149
Well, get in line.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.553
This is the line to renew
your driver's license?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.555
No, this is the line
for tickets

06:27.588 --> 06:28.656
to see Scritti Politti.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.758
Yeah, this is the line.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.026
Man, all these people.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.162
I thought I was gonna be
out of here in an hour.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.531
Ha! Try three.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.667
Make that three and a half.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.177
While my father
was getting in line,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.613
my mother was about
to get out of line.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.583
Well, Rochelle,
all I need you to do
is to help the children

06:55.616 --> 06:58.686
pick out a book, and
then send them to the
front to pay for it.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.987
That's it?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.790
That's it. I have everything
else under control.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.492
No, you don't.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.961
I could've stayed
at home for this.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.062
Back at school
it was lunchtime.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.699
Today's special
was "Running Like Hell."

07:11.732 --> 07:13.567
You ready?
Ready.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.203
All right, now just be cool
and keep walking.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.086
My biggest worry at this point

07:33.120 --> 07:35.856
was that the cops would think
I was chasing Greg.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.028
CHRIS ROCK:
While we were cutting class,

07:41.061 --> 07:44.097
Greg was sweating like
Lil Kim in Sunday School.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.566
You think they
know we're gone?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.067
The only one that would even
notice is Caruso.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.202
He can just beat
somebody else up.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.038
What's that?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.873
I was up all night

07:52.906 --> 07:54.274
packing for everything
we might need.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.876
I've got peanut butter
sandwiches

07:55.909 --> 07:57.277
in case we get hungry,

07:57.310 --> 07:59.212
I've got some wet naps
in case we get sticky

07:59.246 --> 08:00.147
from the peanut
butter sandwiches,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.516
I brought a compass
in case we get lost,

08:02.550 --> 08:06.086
some extra water,
Rolaids, aspirin,

08:06.119 --> 08:07.821
a traveling
toothbrush...

08:07.855 --> 08:10.157
Greg, we're going to the movies,
not Gilligan's Island.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.693
If we did, Greg would
have got with Mrs. Howell.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.094
Hold on.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.130
For my "cutting school"
scrapbook.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.266
Smile.

08:19.299 --> 08:23.537
Greg saw that picture
on eBay last week for $500.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.875
Only problem with my mother
helping at a book fair

08:27.908 --> 08:30.544
was she didn't read books
.and she wasn't fair.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.846
Girl, does your mother
know you're over here

08:32.880 --> 08:34.047
reading grown

08:34.081 --> 08:36.784
Give me that.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.552
Flowers in the Attic.

08:38.586 --> 08:42.289
Now that sounds nice.
Read that.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.992
You done lost your
Jackie Collins mind.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.161
And don't cut your
eyes at me, either.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.799
Boy, don't you know you are
too big for a coloring book?

08:51.832 --> 08:52.900
White kids your age

08:52.933 --> 08:55.102
are building sculptures by now
and you're over here

08:55.135 --> 08:56.604
trying to stay inside the lines.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.238
Come on, Picasso.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.607
Get to chippin'.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.041
Come on. Chip on.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.710
Chip, chip, chip.
Chip, chip, chip.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.012
You shouldn't be embarrassed
that your boy only has

09:05.045 --> 09:06.580
a fifth grade
reading level.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.182
You should be
embarrassed that he's 27.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.084
He should be reading
War and Peace,

09:11.118 --> 09:12.686
not Horton Hears a Who.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.955
Here. Here you go.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.727
Hey, baby,
how's it going?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.094
Mom...

09:21.128 --> 09:22.596
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.597
I didn't mean
to call you "baby."
Mom!

09:23.631 --> 09:26.199
Honey, I...
Mom, just be quiet.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.669
What are y'all laughing at,
with your hoop earrings on?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.070
Let's see if your
mother's giggling

09:30.103 --> 09:31.872
when you're bringing
home babies.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
:
Who's laughing now, huh?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.309
It ain't funny no more, is it?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.712
Come on over here, girl.
Buy some lemonade.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.047
It's good.
My baby made it.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.615
The line was getting shorter,

09:41.649 --> 09:43.884
and so was
my father's patience.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.690
What?!

09:54.662 --> 09:56.163
You'd think they were married.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.831
May I help you?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.399
You got people out here.
You can't just go to lunch.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.801
People have
stuff to do.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.202
Then why don't you
come back another day?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.638
Because my license
expires today.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.807
Well, then I guess you're
just gonna have to wait.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.976
And don't bang
on this door again.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.279
She's lucky he didn't
bang on her head.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.850
The weirdest thing about being
out of school on a school day

10:16.884 --> 10:19.086
was plain and simple:
no kids.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.789
This feels strange,
like everyone's staring at us.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.725
Almost like being a black kid
at an all

10:24.758 --> 10:26.293
Enjoy the show.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.698
Um, two tickets
for Ghostbusters, please?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.399
Two dollars.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.441
Why aren't you kids in school?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.678
:
Uh... see, it's, uh...

10:45.879 --> 10:47.147
Uh...

10:47.180 --> 10:50.117
It's a black, uh... holiday.

10:50.150 --> 10:50.984
Yeah.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.853
Yeah

10:52.886 --> 10:54.855
Yeah, Chris,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.924
which one?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.258
Uh...

10:58.291 --> 11:01.094
The Autobiography...

11:01.128 --> 11:04.264
of Miss Jane Pittman Day.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.766
Hm.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.100
Great woman.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.969
She was a credit to your race.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.371
And Howdy Doody's
a credit to yours.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.974
What are you doing here?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.443
I'm an octoroon.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.411
In that case,
only one-eighth of him

11:18.445 --> 11:19.980
should be off from school.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.150
Okay. Enjoy the show.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.218
Happy holidays.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.924
If I made it past this guy,
I would finally get to see

11:30.958 --> 11:32.325
Ernie Hudson's best work.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.329
Meanwhile, at the DMV,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.131
my father was playing
the waiting game,

11:38.165 --> 11:40.167
and he was losing.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.736
MAN :
126, window "A."

11:44.104 --> 11:46.406
37, "D."

11:48.976 --> 11:51.078
37, "D."

11:55.515 --> 11:58.285
42, window "F."

12:05.358 --> 12:07.060
Number 25?

12:07.094 --> 12:10.063
Anyone in line
to take the driver's test,

12:10.097 --> 12:11.799
the line forms outside...

12:11.832 --> 12:13.466
Can I help you?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.268
Yes, you can help me.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.504
I'm here to renew my license.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.875
WOMAN:
Number 127, window "F."

12:21.909 --> 12:25.178
127, window "F."

12:25.212 --> 12:27.214
This license is expired.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.415
No, it's not.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.950
It expires today.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.085
It expired today at 10:00 a.m.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.921
It is almost 2:00.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.858
Yeah, but I been standing
in line since 7:45 a.m.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.327
Are you one of those people
that likes to wait

12:40.360 --> 12:42.029
until the last minute to pay?

12:42.062 --> 12:44.497
No, I'm one of those people
who likes to wait

12:44.531 --> 12:47.067
until the last four hours
and 15 minutes to pay!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.536
Would you like a dime so you
can call someone who cares?

12:49.569 --> 12:52.139
I can't believe
he didn't take the dime.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.775
Please, can't I just give you
my money and go?

12:56.476 --> 12:57.945
Yeah.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.112
Thanks.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.915
Right after you take
your written test.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.484
Wha...? I've been driving
for over 20 years.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.319
I know the rules of the road.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.587
My father knew the rules

13:07.620 --> 13:10.190
of the road,
but they were his rules.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.360
In a construction zone,
you speed up.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.262
When pedestrians are entering
the crosswalk...

13:16.229 --> 13:17.530
...speed up.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.534
At a railroad crossing,
you really speed up.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.205
In the meantime, my mother
decided to give Tonya

13:25.238 --> 13:28.608
a lesson in making
the hard sell.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.411
Hey. What's wrong, baby?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.246
Nobody's buying
my bookmarks.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.849
So what, you're just gonna
sit here and mope?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.985
I don't know
what else to do.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.020
Well, these bookmarks
ain't gonna sell themselves.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.554
Especially because you can use

13:41.588 --> 13:44.925
any piece of paper for free.
If people ain't coming
to the bookmarks,

13:44.958 --> 13:47.260
you take the bookmarks
to the people-- take that side.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.996
Lift it higher, girl.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.936
That was a bigger fire hazard

13:55.969 --> 13:58.906
than pyrotechnics
at a Great White concert.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.074
Hey, girl, you got a bookmark?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.609
No, thank you, I don't need one.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.244
Oh, okay, Miss Evelyn Wood.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.913
I guess you're just
gonna speed-read

14:05.946 --> 14:06.980
through the whole book.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.181
And who are you?

14:08.215 --> 14:10.317
Oh, who are you?
With your magic book

14:10.350 --> 14:13.020
that just stays open
to whatever page
you leave it on.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.654
Excuse me, I got to go.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.556
Girl, you need to go
with your cheap behind.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.259
You can't spend 25 cents
on a bookmark?

14:19.292 --> 14:22.129
Did you spend
all your money on cookies?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.263
No! I did not spend

14:23.296 --> 14:26.499
my money on cookies, if
it's any business of yours.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.935
I bought a book.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.670
Oh, really?
What's it about,
crushing dreams?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.973
'Cause that's exactly
what you're doing.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.642
Fine! I'll take one.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.277
Thank you. Here you go.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.212
Bye.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.281
Lay off the cookies.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.356
I wonder what they're
doing at school.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.291
Feeling like suckers.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.360
On behalf of the Corleone
Junior High students

14:53.393 --> 14:55.428
I'd like to welcome
a very special guest--

14:55.462 --> 14:57.430
Earth, Wind & Fire!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.468
Yeah, suckers!

15:01.501 --> 15:03.470
WOMAN:
Shh!
Yeah.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.172
Excuse me, can you be quiet?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.940
Ms. Morello?

15:06.974 --> 15:08.508
I thought you were at a funeral.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.611
No, stupid-- she's at yours.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.017
Chris, I'm sorry
for shushing you.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
I know your people can't help
talking in the movies.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.321
Why aren't you in school?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.556
I wonder if she'd believe
.it was Chicken George Day.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.158
Well, we just
finished lunch,

15:25.192 --> 15:26.526
and we figured we'd get

15:26.559 --> 15:27.527
a little popcorn,
and, well, now

15:27.560 --> 15:29.062
we're on our way
back to school.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.032
Chris, please,
don't insult my intelligence.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.135
It's obvious you and Gregory
are playing hooky.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.038
I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but
what are you doing here?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.007
Well, Greg...
Hey, baby.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.208
I got the popcorn.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.542
You want Junior Mints
or Goobers?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.611
I got both.
You're on a date?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.180
Chris, we all grieve
in our own way.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.481
Grieve

15:48.515 --> 15:50.583
Did you go to the funeral, too?
What funeral?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.452
So you lied
about your sister dying?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.387
Yes.
Your sister died?

15:54.421 --> 15:55.755
No.
How could you do that?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.457
That's neither here nor there.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.426
The fact is,
you shouldn't be here.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.461
Well, I'm sorry-- I just wanted
to see this movie.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.663
I didn't think missing one day
of school would hurt.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.267
Chris, I know you must be
a big Ernie Hudson fan--

16:07.300 --> 16:08.701
Thalmus is, too--

16:08.735 --> 16:10.337
but do you think
Ernie Hudson

16:10.370 --> 16:12.005
cut school to go see

16:12.039 --> 16:13.440
Gary Coleman movies
while he was growing up?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.375
Gary Coleman made a movie?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.544
And, Greg, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.680
You can see a white man
in a movie anytime.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.283
Sorry.
Come on, Greg, let's go.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.517
Chris, wait.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.020
Stay.
Are you serious?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.256
Yes. But don't you ever
let me find out

16:29.289 --> 16:31.658
you've done anything
like this again, you understand?

16:31.691 --> 16:32.659
Yes, ma'am.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.662
Could you not mention
that you saw me here?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.397
Yes, ma'am.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.431
Nice meeting you.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.500
:
Enjoy the movie.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.302
Yeah.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.574
Back at the DMV,
my father was DOA.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.609
I'm sorry, sir, you fail.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.211
What do you mean, fail?

16:51.244 --> 16:52.579
Let me see that!

16:52.612 --> 16:53.813
What's wrong with this one?

16:53.846 --> 16:57.350
Speed limit in a school
zone is 25, not 50.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.785
Not if he's late.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.687
Fine. I'll do it again.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.623
What do you think you're doing?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.724
I'm going to take the test.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.360
You got to get in line,
get a number,

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
wait for that number
to be called,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.364
proceed to my counter,
where I will give you a new exam

17:11.398 --> 17:13.533
and then you can go
to the testing area.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.834
I have to do this again?!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.336
If you want a license.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.772
WOMAN :
Number 157, Window "B."

17:19.806 --> 17:23.176
Good thing
she can't read minds.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.811
42!

17:28.148 --> 17:30.283
"It...

17:30.317 --> 17:32.519
"was... the...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.154
"beast of...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.755
"times.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.324
"It...

17:37.357 --> 17:39.826
"was... the...

17:39.859 --> 17:41.194
"roast...

17:41.228 --> 17:42.629
of times."

17:42.662 --> 17:44.631
I mean, my God, boy,
did you eat

17:44.664 --> 17:46.433
a bowl of lead paint
for breakfast?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.735
Go on and sit down
and let one of these

17:48.768 --> 17:50.370
other illiterates
take a crack at it.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.306
Excuse me, can I speak
to you for a minute?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.242
Oh, I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.210
Yes. You.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.613
MAN :
26, window "A."

18:00.647 --> 18:03.350
Drive safely.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.354
Thank you.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.855
Here you go.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.690
Oh, you don't pay me.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.392
That's the line to go pay.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.877
59!

18:37.750 --> 18:40.553
Hey, baby.
Where you been all day?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.289
:
Getting my license.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.656
It was horrible.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.592
Remind me to renew early
next time.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
How was it at school?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.229
Mom got kicked out.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.630
What?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.465
Yeah, they called the cops
and everything.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.468
Yeah, we had to beg for them
to let her go.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.304
Why are you arresting me?!

18:57.337 --> 18:58.805
You should be arresting
these teachers!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.673
Please let my mama go!

19:00.707 --> 19:02.675
Kids at a book fair
that can't read!

19:02.709 --> 19:05.345
Oh, get her
out of here!
I should call Jesse Jackson!

19:05.378 --> 19:06.679
Jesse!

19:08.848 --> 19:10.950
What happened?
Those people
don't know how

19:10.983 --> 19:12.885
to run a book fair,
that's what happened.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.356
Chris, how was your day?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.691
The hardest thing about having
such a great day

19:18.725 --> 19:19.892
was pretending
it never happened.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.194
What do you mean?

19:21.228 --> 19:23.696
What do you mean,
what do I mean?
It's a simple question.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.964
I know.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.733
Okay.
Okay what?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.868
Did anything interesting
happen in school today?

19:28.901 --> 19:29.736
Like what?

19:29.769 --> 19:30.903
Like I don't know.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.573
You were there all day--
that's why I'm asking you.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.907
Nothing happened.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.945
Why didn't you just say that?

19:38.978 --> 19:40.380
After getting away
with cutting school today,

19:40.413 --> 19:42.982
I was thinking about seeing
Brewster's Millions tomorrow.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.884
Chris, how many times
do I have to tell you

19:44.917 --> 19:46.853
to hang up your jacket
when you come in?

19:46.886 --> 19:49.756
WOMAN :
I am standing here
with Verdine White

19:49.789 --> 19:52.325
of legendary R&B group
Earth, Wind & Fire,

19:52.359 --> 19:55.828
who did an impromptu concert
today for the lucky kids

19:55.862 --> 19:57.564
at Corleone Junior High.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.366
Verdine, how was it?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.368
WHITE:
It was really great.
"Ghostbusters"?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.770
But the only sad thing, though,
I heard there was

20:03.803 --> 20:05.872
a black kid named Chris
at the school,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.006
but he wasn't here.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.277
WOMAN:
Well, that's too bad for Chris.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.445
Reporting live,
I'm Julie Lancaster at Corleone

20:12.479 --> 20:13.580
Junior High.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.715
Back to you, Bob, at the studio.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.817
So nothing happened
in school today, huh?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.652
Uh, uh...

20:19.686 --> 20:21.754
Who you gonna call?

20:21.788 --> 20:24.591
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.260
