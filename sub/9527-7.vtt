WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.461
Yeah, so it looks like I have herpes
'cause I nicked it a bunch.

00:03.545 --> 00:04.921
Well, yeah, you got to use aftershave.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.714
- On the nuts?
- Yeah.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.758
So the suspense is killing me.
What's going on here?

00:08.842 --> 00:12.178
Okay, well get ready
for the freaking main event

00:12.262 --> 00:17.266
because DeMamp family gatherings
are off the chain.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.018
- Yeah.
- Like, we'll be moshing.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.853
Like, freaking whoa.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.022
My Aunt Holly will whip out her giant breasts.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.190
- Yes!
- And there's, like...

00:24.274 --> 00:25.483
The nipple's, like, all hollows out,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.276
and then, like, she'll hold it out like this,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.278
and it'll catch some wind, and it'll whistle.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.114
- It's kind of whistle tit.
- She has a whistle tit?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.532
- She has a whistle tit.
- Whistle tits!

00:32.616 --> 00:34.867
- Oh!
- This is gonna be so cool!

00:34.952 --> 00:36.869
And swordplay for Blake.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.414
Oh, yeah, because Blue Knight
is definitely gonna be there, right?

00:39.498 --> 00:41.207
- Yes, he will.
- Yes, dude!

00:41.291 --> 00:42.667
- I don't know what that is.
- Oh, dude.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.253
His cousin, he's Blue Knight
at Medieval Times, Buena Park.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.255
You think he'll knight me? He said he would.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.673
He's definitely knighting you.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.050
Should we have brought gifts?
It's like a family reunion or what?

00:51.135 --> 00:52.802
- Oh, no...
- Frigging even better.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
My dead grandpa's funeral.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.807
Oh, yeah. Dead!

01:01.854 --> 01:03.354
I'm fresh

01:04.523 --> 01:06.649
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

01:06.734 --> 01:08.317
Gotta be fresh

01:10.028 --> 01:11.904
Who let these hounds in?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.823
Hounds! Hounds, hounds, hounds!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.283
Hounds. Oh.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.868
Is this the right room?

01:17.161 --> 01:18.244
This doesn't seem like a wake.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.246
Seems more like a sleep. I want to take a nap.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.292
Body, body.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.170
This is definitely the right place.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.756
They're probably punking us, dude.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.091
Uncle Tuck.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.510
His dick... It's like a corkscrew.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.471
When it gets hard, it freaking unravels.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.930
It's... Show him.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.390
- That's a bummer.
- Okay.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.017
Would like to see that.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.143
Aunt Holly.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.812
Whip out them floppy dogs.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.105
They actually emit sound.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.357
- It's like she's a freak show.
- Whoa.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.819
Okay. Well, you are being
a total psychopath right now.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.071
Adam, there is a body in that casket.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.531
I'm gonna black out. I can't handle...

01:55.616 --> 01:59.076
Yo, Adam, what's good, cuz?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.120
You don't recognize me, do you?

02:01.205 --> 02:04.707
The emotions of the day
have rattled the old noggin.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.584
It's me, bro.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.711
Big fat

02:08.796 --> 02:10.505
- Come on, it's me!
- Oh!

02:11.131 --> 02:13.382
I lost 280 pounds, man.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.886
Wow, dude. You look horrible.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.472
Admittedly, you look sick,
like you're dying from something.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.307
No, Annette's got me on this juice diet, man.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.434
She's actually got
the whole family back on track,

02:24.061 --> 02:26.646
working at Easy As Pie,
her and Gramps' pizza chain.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.814
It's great.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.357
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.444
There she is, the gold digger
that stole Gramps' entire retirement fund.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.656
She freaking blew it all
on a successful pizza chain

02:36.740 --> 02:39.742
instead of blowing at Pechanga
Hotel Casino and Resort,

02:39.952 --> 02:41.202
which is what a DeMamp would do.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.620
Body, body, body.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.080
She started Easy As Pie?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.416
So you're telling me she's got
access to a lot of pizza.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.751
Yeah.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.919
That's cool.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.087
Blue Knight.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.839
Dude, I hardly recognize you.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.465
You cut your hair off.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.759
Man, friends don't let friends
get haircuts, right?

02:57.219 --> 02:58.427
I think you got the wrong guy.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.263
Find another pew.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.807
Blue Knight, it's me, Blake.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.518
I came to your tournament
of champions with Adam.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.019
You, like, kicked ass, man.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.189
Afterwards we were just drinking
port wine in the parking lot.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.191
We got so hammered. We sword fought, dude.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.068
But not like that.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.778
With our wieners.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.530
I saw your nuts, dude.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.782
Well, yeah. That was a long time ago.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.325
I'm not the Blue Knight anymore.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.035
My name's Tony DeMamp.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.412
- Get lost.
- Okay.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.830
Well, I don't know if you remember this,

03:25.914 --> 03:28.416
but, um, you said you'd knight me.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.709
I said I don't remember.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.586
Now you either pay your respects,

03:31.670 --> 03:33.337
or you get the hell out of here.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.505
Hey, guys, I'd love to leave now.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.215
I hate this, so if we could leave right now...

03:36.300 --> 03:38.342
- Thank you, yes.
- People are being weird.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.552
They're acting like someone died.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.678
- Yeah.
- You know.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.638
But, like, in a not fun way.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.640
- Yeah.
- You know what?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.642
I should get the party started.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.020
But with your help.
I'm gonna need both of you.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.187
- Come. Come with.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.189
Ahem!

03:56.320 --> 03:57.486
What up?

03:57.571 --> 04:01.699
Hey, it's me, Adam, your relative DeMamp.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.161
I'm here to say a few words about Gramps...

04:08.373 --> 04:11.250
Military, family,

04:12.252 --> 04:15.087
beer, methamphetamines,

04:15.339 --> 04:17.965
trailer park for a while, convict.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.176
He was an American hero.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.638
He's was an American a-hole,
and you all know it.

04:24.890 --> 04:25.890
Dad!

04:25.974 --> 04:27.975
And he deserves a proper funeral.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.936
Thanks for warming them up, Son.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.604
I'll take it from here. Hey, now!

04:32.314 --> 04:35.232
Well, the old man finally bit the farm.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.276
I bet he's down in hell
looking up at us right now going,

04:37.361 --> 04:41.530
"Hey, dumbasses, we're the
united DeMamps of America, remember?

04:42.032 --> 04:45.201
"Let's light a butt-ton of fireworks
and crank some of the Offspring!"

04:45.285 --> 04:46.285
- Yes!
- Hit it, Adam.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.620
Oh, I'm supposed to hit it?

04:47.704 --> 04:48.913
- Hit it!
- Okay.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.793
- It's too late, bro.
- No, the Offspring!

04:53.877 --> 04:54.835
Hit it!

04:59.007 --> 05:00.007
Pritchard!

05:00.509 --> 05:03.427
I know that this isn't
the traditional DeMamp funeral,

05:03.512 --> 05:05.346
but this is what George wanted.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.140
He loved you all so much,

05:08.225 --> 05:10.893
and he was so very proud
of how you've all improved.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.812
You call this improvement?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.605
Tuck, why isn't your pecker out?

05:14.690 --> 05:16.315
Unleash the corkscrew!

05:16.400 --> 05:18.651
- He's got a screw loose.
- Aunt Holly!

05:18.902 --> 05:21.028
You're usually down to your G-string by now.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.239
Ha-ha! Take them clothes off, trick.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.574
What happened to this family? Oh, right.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.120
You're all proud employees
of the Easy As Pie pizzeria

05:29.246 --> 05:30.621
with your dental insurance.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.373
This isn't even a pizza family.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.833
This is a cheeseburger family!

05:33.917 --> 05:35.376
We love the burgs.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.295
Bread, meat, cheese, bread, meat!

05:38.964 --> 05:40.631
Cheese. You can't stop on meat.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.675
George and I built Easy As Pie together,

05:42.759 --> 05:44.135
and he loved that company.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.513
Can we please just bury him in peace?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.390
I don't think so, ho.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.310
- Is that a bomb?
- No, it's a smoke bomb.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.563
Come on, let's go!
Let's wheel this sucker out of here!

05:55.647 --> 05:57.606
No way, I'm not touching
that dead-ass dude box.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.692
What are we gonna do?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.277
Are we gonna take the body
to Aunt Patty's house

06:01.361 --> 06:02.445
and feed him to her raccoons?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.030
- That sounds badass.
- No way.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.406
Oh, I bet you got a better idea.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.241
Damn right, Gramps was a paratrooper,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.118
so we're gonna crenate his body in a bonfire

06:09.202 --> 06:11.787
and scatter his ashes from the sky,
just like he always wanted.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.165
- I knew you'd have a good idea.
- I didn't.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.583
Me either.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.876
The casket!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.210
It's gone!

06:18.295 --> 06:19.420
Where did they go?

06:19.504 --> 06:21.130
Here's the deal, I don't know where they went,

06:21.298 --> 06:23.299
but I can find out and I can give 'em to you.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.967
Oh, God. Okay, thank you.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.886
- Thank you so much.
- Hang on a second, toots.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.513
Let's talk about what's in it for me, all right?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.432
'Cause I'll be honest.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.309
I'm a little hungry for some of that...

06:35.645 --> 06:36.687
Excuse me?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.148
Pizza? What do you...

06:39.524 --> 06:41.776
Yeah, this is the slice of pizza.
You own a pizza chain.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.402
You should know the international sign for...

06:43.695 --> 06:45.196
Anyway, what I'm telling you is that,

06:45.280 --> 06:46.322
in return for my services,

06:46.406 --> 06:49.075
I would like a lifetime subscription to pizza.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.493
Done. How do we do this?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.994
I'm just gonna text 'em.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.375
You gotta be fresh

07:02.672 --> 07:05.508
My dad freaking rules, dude.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.634
Yeah, he's, uh...

07:06.718 --> 07:08.886
How old was he when he had you, again?

07:09.054 --> 07:12.932
I know he started
boning at 13, as DeMamps do.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.351
- So 13, I think.
- Wow.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.645
That guy freaking plows, too.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.730
- We are on fire tonight!
- Yeah, a total party animal.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.107
Uh, have you ever noticed, though,

07:21.191 --> 07:22.858
that he's obsessed with one-upping you?

07:23.110 --> 07:26.654
Here they come to snuff the rooster!

07:26.738 --> 07:29.657
He lets me win at a ton of stuff,
unless it's, you know,

07:29.741 --> 07:31.867
telling funny stories or banging chicks

07:31.952 --> 07:35.454
or being a badass, or any other of his, like,
designated areas.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.997
There's rules. There's rules to...

07:37.082 --> 07:38.374
Yes, whatever, man.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.336
All I'm saying is, okay,
you can't think that this is a good idea.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.630
Going into the forest
and burning your grandfather

07:44.714 --> 07:47.883
like a warlock in the middle
of the woods is a good idea,

07:47.968 --> 07:50.928
'cause it's not, dude.
You have to have a better idea than this.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.389
Hey, guys, let's make
the next right into the woods,

07:53.473 --> 07:54.640
and let's crenate Gramps.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.810
All right, what are we doing?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.270
All right, here's the plan.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.981
We're gonna break in
and crenate Gramps' body

08:02.065 --> 08:04.650
in Annette's very own pizza ovens.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.695
God damn it, Adam. That's...

08:08.405 --> 08:09.655
The same plan, man,

08:09.739 --> 08:12.283
except in, like, a stupider location, dude.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.118
- It's a different idea.
- All right,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.912
and it's cremate, not crenate.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.456
Okay, does the body turn to cream?

08:19.624 --> 08:20.666
No, it does not.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.127
It does not turn to cream. It turns to ash.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.129
- Crenate.
- It's crenate.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.338
- It's crenate!
- All right, Adam.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.508
I'm not gonna watch you burn
your dead grandpa's body

08:29.593 --> 08:30.926
in an oven, man, all right?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.678
That will haunt my dreams, okay?

08:32.762 --> 08:35.097
And I've been having good dreams lately,
all right?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.933
It's me, Jessica Alba,
you know, we're dry humping.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.351
I have walrus tusks.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.854
Okay, well it was your idea
to me to have an idea, so...

08:41.938 --> 08:44.190
Yeah, Adam I got to say,
this plan's stupid as hell.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.567
Give me the keys,
I'm gonna do this thing the right way.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.777
I'm not gonna give you the keys

08:48.904 --> 08:50.529
'cause we're gonna do it the right way,

08:50.780 --> 08:53.282
which is my way, for one way.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.035
No, you give me the keys!
No, what are you doing?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.620
Stop jingling on... I know what you're doing.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.039
That's the same thing you
do when you eat shrimp.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.290
No!

09:01.374 --> 09:04.210
Dude, you don't have
to swallow the key!

09:04.294 --> 09:05.502
Yeah, he did.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.712
Taught him that move myself.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.255
Classic DeMamp maneuv.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.340
Say that three times fast.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.300
DeMamp maneuv.
DeMamp maneuv. DeMamp maneuv.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.551
Stop!

09:12.636 --> 09:13.636
You couldn't.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.929
That was tough. I have key in my throat.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.055
All right, all right. All right.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.432
I'm calling, I'm calling Ders. I'm going home.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.184
I'm... I try to be a supportive friend.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.727
I can't do it anymore.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.979
Blake, yeah. I'd love to come pick you up.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.397
Where are you?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.941
Where is he?

09:27.525 --> 09:29.068
Uh-huh. Yeah, okay.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.653
We can be there in about 15 minutes.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.656
Okay, bye. Let's talk pizza.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.908
I want a card with my face on it

09:35.992 --> 09:37.576
that I can take to any one of your locations

09:37.661 --> 09:39.453
and get free pizza for the rest of my life.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.955
Just tell me where they are.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.373
535 West Washington Avenue.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.541
But first... I just fucked that up, didn't I?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.045
Well, this definitely isn't working.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.922
There's just a bunch of crispy chunks.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.466
"You shall never be a knight!"

09:53.176 --> 09:54.927
Screw you, you evil wizard!

09:56.221 --> 09:57.346
I'm gonna be a knight!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.932
I'm gonna be a... Guys!

10:00.016 --> 10:01.517
We got company!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.394
Specifically, the owner of this company.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.478
Annette is here.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.313
Gramps isn't even close to being done.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.940
Grab something to stuff his ashes into.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.608
Uh, what about this big old pizza bag?

10:09.693 --> 10:11.360
No, grab that big old pizza bag.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.821
Looks like the same pizza bag...

10:14.364 --> 10:16.240
Ew, that's gross.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.201
Now, now, just one second.
You promised me free pizza.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.453
Are, are you squelching?
Is this a pizza squelch?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.330
- Stop talking about the pizza!
- You know what?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.291
I'm gonna run in there right now
and I'm gonna blow this raid.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.251
You guys, you guys!

10:27.502 --> 10:29.044
You guys better wait outside.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.838
You guys! They're here!

10:30.922 --> 10:32.172
You got to run!

10:34.217 --> 10:35.551
- Hey, get back here.
- Oh, oh!

10:35.635 --> 10:36.635
DeMamps! DeMamps!

10:36.720 --> 10:39.138
Help! We got company, guys!

10:39.222 --> 10:40.973
Adam, Adam, Adam! Help! Help!

10:41.057 --> 10:42.099
All right, all right.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.309
There's nowhere to go.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.810
Just tell me where Gramps' casket is.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.895
Okay, yes, I will tell you where the body is.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
Right after you knight me.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.274
Dude, I'm not gonna knight you.
I don't even work there any...

10:50.358 --> 10:52.151
- Get your ass in there!
- Hey, whoa!

10:53.069 --> 10:55.154
- What gives?
- Sorry, Blake.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.655
My dad told me you're a liability,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.157
and then he explained to me
what that word meant,

10:58.241 --> 10:59.825
and that's exactly what you are, man.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.368
You led him right to us.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.494
Let's get to the park.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.246
- Hey, guys.
- Ders!

11:04.414 --> 11:06.206
I came with Annette,
but she squelched on a deal,

11:06.291 --> 11:09.168
so I'm willing do a double-cross
and strike a deal with you guys.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.669
I do want to make a deal.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.380
Come here, I'm gonna whisper in your ear.
Weird naked choke!

11:13.465 --> 11:14.715
- No!
- No naked!

11:14.799 --> 11:15.841
You're beating up all my friends.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
It's like childhood all over again.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.761
Do not shoot.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.846
We are unarmed.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.639
We don't have guns, Adam.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.016
What is going on?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.769
We made burgers in your pizza kitchen.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.395
- Deal with it.
- Adam.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.522
Annette, I'm sorry.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.442
We know how much Gramps loved
Easy As Pie pizza and...

11:34.444 --> 11:37.363
We just wanted to share one last pie
with him before saying adiós.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.116
Now you have to just leave him for us
or I'm gonna have to call the police,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.535
and I don't want to do that
because I know you're on parole.

11:43.787 --> 11:44.787
Appreciate you.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.206
Bye, Gramps.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.416
Release.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.177
That was so cool.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.805
I can't wait to go find Ders
and tell him about it.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.973
He's in the casket, Adam.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.642
Yeah, that's right.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.227
That's why it was so cool.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.229
Okay, I still want to tell Ders, though.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.231
I'm gonna need you to yak up them keys now.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.400
- Come on, buddy.
- Okay, all right.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.318
Coming right up, Pops.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.612
There it is.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.156
He's insane

12:22.325 --> 12:23.325
Kick it

12:25.078 --> 12:27.204
Ah, you piece of shit!

12:27.414 --> 12:30.666
- You piece of shit!
- Relax, all right?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.251
Somebody'll let us out in the morning.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.169
The morning? Knight me real quick.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.504
Let's do a sweet double-team move.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.381
Legion of Doom, bro. Just boom!

12:37.465 --> 12:39.341
I'm a maintenance man at a pizzeria.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.386
Besides, I haven't seen
you commit an act of valor,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.221
which is a knighthood pre-req.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.265
- Duh.
- Hey, okay.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.684
I have done a lot of valiant stuff, okay?

12:48.893 --> 12:49.977
Okay, for instance.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.856
I helped a dude in a wheelchair
wipe his butt in a movie theater bathroom.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.359
And it was messy. He had a hairy butt crack.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.278
You know what, fine. You suck, dude.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.321
I'll get us out of here in a stupid way.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.824
Would've been a lot cooler if we, you know,

13:03.908 --> 13:05.117
knighted our way out of here.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.037
Huh?

13:10.206 --> 13:12.166
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.334
Blake, dude! I'm in a casket!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.044
I'm trapped in here! I don't know where I am!

13:16.379 --> 13:17.796
You got to help me! Oh, my God!

13:17.922 --> 13:19.423
- Oh, thank God!

13:20.717 --> 13:23.135
Pritchard! Where is my husband?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.928
I don't... They said something about a park.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.638
Oh, Van Buren Park.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.224
That's where George and I used
to go and make love in public.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.893
- Never mind, I got to go.
- Wait, hang on a second.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.644
You still owe me a lifetime of pizza, ho.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.730
- Your lifetime's over, bitch.
- Wait, no, no, sir!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.231
Sir, sir! Please!

13:36.316 --> 13:38.817
Blake, Blake, they're going to the park,
but they trapped me in here.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.319
I'm locked in here. I'm at the funeral home.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.945
- You have to come get me, please.
- Okay, yeah, um...

13:42.071 --> 13:44.114
I'll come and save you. I'm gonna save you.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.534
What's the deal?
You're just gonna sit here the whole time?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.874
Hey, stop!

13:53.958 --> 13:56.418
- Lay on, peasant.
- Don't.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.253
Oh, yeah!

13:58.338 --> 14:00.047
That's it. Right there, huh?

14:00.215 --> 14:01.381
The intensity.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.802
That's unlike any intensity I've ever seen
in any dinner theater performance,

14:05.887 --> 14:07.387
and I've seen a lot of dinner theater, man.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.181
I saw Hall and Oates actually
in this intimate little...

14:09.265 --> 14:12.476
It was that intensity that got me fired
from Medieval Times.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.978
One night, I got too revved up,

14:15.063 --> 14:18.273
and I speared Yellow Knight's
horse right through the leg.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.026
They had to shoot him,

14:21.486 --> 14:23.946
right there in front
of some kid's birthday party.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.697
They had to shoot Yellow Knight?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.157
- The horse!
- Yeah.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.786
And then I met Annette, and I cut my hair.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.164
She gave me a job,

14:34.249 --> 14:37.292
and she made me realize that I
had to leave the arena forever.

14:38.962 --> 14:43.549
Unfortunately, you're in my arena now, biatch!

14:50.223 --> 14:51.348
Yeah, you see that?

14:51.432 --> 14:53.392
You're not even that good
at sword fighting anymore!

14:53.476 --> 14:55.394
You're not a Blue Knight,
you're a biatch knight.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.104
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep, that's...

14:57.939 --> 14:58.939
All right.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.316
No, no, no, no.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.526
No.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.822
Blue Knight is back.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.907
That felt so good.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.117
Hello?

15:12.370 --> 15:13.912
Hello, I'm in here!

15:18.710 --> 15:19.751
You got that winched?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.503
- Is it winched tight?
- Fully winched.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.671
Okay, I'm gonna walk back there.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.047
I'm gonna strap into the chute.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.341
- When I give you the signal...
- No!

15:26.467 --> 15:28.176
Aw, here comes the damn cavalry.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.845
Stop it!

15:29.929 --> 15:33.015
Welcome to the party, Annette.
This is happening.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.266
Wait! Stop!

15:34.350 --> 15:35.684
Get off my father!

15:36.144 --> 15:37.769
Ders! Where you at, dragon?

15:42.859 --> 15:43.984
- Hello?
- Blake,

15:44.068 --> 15:46.612
I need you get here right now,
because something's going on.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.031
I don't know what it is,
but it's getting really hot in here.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.617
- It's hot?
- I'm still in the casket.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.868
It's heating up.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.579
I know where you are! I'm coming!

15:56.372 --> 15:57.789
- Oh, no!
- You got to help me!

15:57.874 --> 15:59.041
Oh, my God!

15:59.125 --> 16:01.209
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
- Dude, bro!

16:01.336 --> 16:03.295
- What are you doing!
- Oh, no!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.547
- We're too late.
- That's not Ders.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.176
Yep, sorry.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.012
- Ders!
- Blake! Blake!

16:12.096 --> 16:13.138
Oh, man.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.681
You guys are lifesavers.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.058
Hey, bud. How you doing?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.267
- Not good.
- Okay.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.811
- I was just frying in there.
- Okay.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.730
I shouldn't have worn
this blazer, is the problem.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.109
Bestow this upon your brow
and kneel before me.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.782
Ders, film this.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.243
Congratulations on your act of valor.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.164
I knight thee, Nate knight.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.167
Blake knight.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.420
Because of your bravery,
you can have my sword.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.880
Yes. Thank you.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.840
Hey, I hate to interrupt, but where's Adam?

16:48.925 --> 16:51.593
Get off of him! What are we doing?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.095
We're DeMamps!

16:53.888 --> 16:56.556
We don't mourn, okay?

16:56.808 --> 16:57.808
We mosh!

16:57.892 --> 16:59.351
We don't cry.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.603
We crush!

17:01.938 --> 17:03.397
When you're in the mosh pit and you're crying

17:03.481 --> 17:05.524
'cause you're having so much fun,
that's what we do!

17:06.234 --> 17:07.526
It's DeMamps!

17:07.610 --> 17:09.277
All of a sudden, we get
a little money in our pockets,

17:09.612 --> 17:11.029
and we're divided?

17:11.489 --> 17:14.449
We shouldn't even have pockets!

17:15.243 --> 17:17.285
We are a sweatpants family!

17:18.454 --> 17:22.207
So, please, let my dad

17:22.792 --> 17:27.087
dump my grandfather's ash chunks
from on high like he would've wanted.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.215
You're the one.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.176
This family needs you to fly, son.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.303
So fly.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.140
Yes!

17:39.475 --> 17:40.517
Yes!

17:40.768 --> 17:42.060
- Yes!
- Yeah!

17:42.145 --> 17:43.520
Yeah!

17:46.566 --> 17:49.151
Okay, I'm turning on the hero in this situation.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.320
Go down in family history, as a hero.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.323
DeMamps!

17:55.867 --> 17:57.367
DeMamps rule!

17:58.745 --> 18:01.121
- You ready to do this, Son?
- I'm a hero!

18:01.414 --> 18:03.081
I'm a hero!

18:03.166 --> 18:05.125
Let's do this!

18:14.677 --> 18:17.053
Come on, little birdy.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.805
Take flight!

18:21.559 --> 18:23.101
Ouch, yikes.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.439
Yeah!

18:28.274 --> 18:29.816
Gramps DeMamp!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.528
DeMamps rise again!

18:34.614 --> 18:37.949
I'm the hero. I'm the hero of the fam.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.252
Yeah, man, two tits up!

18:57.345 --> 19:00.388
- Hey, 40s!
- Oh, yeah.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.057
Whoo!

19:02.225 --> 19:03.558
You know, Gramps would've been proud.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.019
You saved this fine family.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.729
Thanks for letting me be the hero,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.231
and for not one-upping me, Dad.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.399
Yeah, you know, there's one other tiny thing

19:11.484 --> 19:14.069
I should tell you before I get drunker
than you ever could.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.362
Hmm?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.573
I'm not actually your father.

19:19.951 --> 19:20.951
What?

19:21.118 --> 19:24.079
Son, I'm your brother, bro.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.540
Dad took off,

19:26.624 --> 19:28.875
me and mom figured
the most logical thing to do

19:28.960 --> 19:30.669
would be to lie to your face forever.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.504
That's cool.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.755
Yeah?

19:34.090 --> 19:36.258
'Cause you were a horrible dad.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.342
Yeah.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.177
You'd probably make an awesome brother.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.054
You lied to me my whole life!

19:41.138 --> 19:43.515
- That's hilarious.
- Yeah!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.350
Yeah!

19:45.434 --> 19:46.810
Adam, what's up, dude?

19:47.228 --> 19:48.353
I'm a knight.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.188
How's, uh... How's this all going?

19:50.273 --> 19:52.858
I could've killed myself.
It was really dangerous.

19:52.942 --> 19:53.984
So it was awesome.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.237
Hey, I'd like to introduce my brother, Dad.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.199
- What?
- I believe this makes us even.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.868
Uh, I believe I asked you

20:02.952 --> 20:04.995
for a lifetime subscription to pizza, so...

20:05.079 --> 20:07.998
Well, then I will just go ahead
and take this to somebody else.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.416
No, no, we're cool. We're good.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.792
- We're okay?
- We're even.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.712
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to let you know that I get it.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.714
I totally get it about the DeMamps.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.383
They do everything just a little
different and so did Gramps.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.844
I'm sure you know... The sculptures.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.554
You haven't seen...
Have you seen the sculptures?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.806
Yeah, because I had them destroyed.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.142
It's very dark stuff, extremely disturbing.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.644
Anyhoo, I guess it's about time to, you know,

20:29.729 --> 20:31.730
get this bitch-ass party started!

20:31.814 --> 20:33.064
- Oh, yes.
- Whoa.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.066
That did not seem natural.

20:35.151 --> 20:39.154
But, I mean, you steal a dead husband
and ladies go wild, right?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.156
You think she'd be into me?

20:42.158 --> 20:43.533
Only one way to find out.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.493
Party time!

20:45.828 --> 20:47.662
Hey! It's a party time!

20:48.497 --> 20:50.248
Yeah, come on, Blue Knight!

20:50.333 --> 20:51.416
Yeah!

20:51.667 --> 20:54.336
I love funerals!

21:01.969 --> 21:03.637
Sometimes, like, I want, you know,

21:03.721 --> 21:05.931
you won't have sex,
but you'll definitely see stuff.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.266
- Oh, like watching?
- Like watching.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.976
Dude, sometimes I like watching more,

21:10.061 --> 21:11.186
'cause they're, like... It, like...

21:11.270 --> 21:13.271
You don't have to, like, live up
to anybody's expectations.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.606
Yeah, it's like, are you worried your dick

21:14.690 --> 21:16.900
might work, not work? And I always am.
