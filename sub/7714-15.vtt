Hello, Vancouver,

00:22.230 --> 00:23.230
What?

00:23.314 --> 00:24.606
l'm not seeing anything
under confirmation. . .

00:24.733 --> 00:26.775
No. No.
Could it be under
"affirmation?"

00:26.860 --> 00:27.860
'Cause you have
thousands of those.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.778
We're just trying to
look it up right now.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.031
You did get the

fully booked for months.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.667
Well, l have been
booked for three years,
so you should have that.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.211
l have always heard
that British Columbia
is a very nice place,

00:46.296 --> 00:48.922
but l'm not getting that
from this conversation.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.302

She bought us sight unseen,
like a mail-order bride,

01:45.313 --> 01:48.440
(CHUCKLES) so she's
gotta be kind of nervous.
I mean, are we ugly?

01:48.525 --> 01:51.360
Are we smart? Are we cooI?
Are we too cooI?

Michael Scott,

02:01.663 --> 02:03.205

02:03.289 --> 02:04.456
Pleasure to meet you,

02:04.541 --> 02:06.125
Uh, that's Mrs. Bennett,
sweetheart.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.502
My husband and l are
divorced but l kept
the "missus"

02:08.586 --> 02:10.838
just to piss off
the new wife.
Oh.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.965
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
Well, let's take a gander
around this place.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.633
These sure are
pretty dogs.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.510
JO: (CHUCKLlNG)
They love a good crotch.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.011
They sure do.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.596
You should take that
as a compliment.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.056
Oh, l do.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.185
JO: Hello.
Hello.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.021
Do you always stay
seated when a lady
enters the room?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.439
l am treating you
the same as a man,

02:29.524 --> 02:31.233
for whom l would
also not stand.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.236
Unless it was
the president,
or Judge Judy.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.780
l like that.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.657
GABE: This is Accounting.
JO: Uh-huh.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.783
Hi.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.951
Good-looking group.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.370
Over here is
Meredith Palmer,
Creed Bratton.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.997
JO: Another couple
of heartbreakers.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.582
Who's this tall
drink of sun tea?

02:46.666 --> 02:50.169
That is Jim Halpert.
He is the co-regional manager
of this office.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.753
l thought this guy
was the manager.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.715
Oh, he is.
He's the co-manager.
That's the other co-manager.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.425
Two guys doing one job?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.469
We gotta do something
about that. (CHUCKLlNG)

03:02.307 --> 03:03.849
l've got some
Valentine's cards

03:03.933 --> 03:06.685
for my co-workers
and my bro-workers.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.228
No. No.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.521
What? No candy?

03:09.939 --> 03:11.607
ANDY: Valentine's Day.
Right around the corner.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.526
Erin and l have been
on zero dates.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.445
So l got her a
Valentine's Day card,

03:16.529 --> 03:18.655
but I didn't want
to seem too eager,

03:18.740 --> 03:20.699
so I got cards for
everyone in the
whoIe office

03:20.783 --> 03:22.701
to kind of diIute
it a IittIe bit.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.912
Look alive.
(EXCLAlMS)

03:24.996 --> 03:27.164
Jeez, you gave me
a paper cut on my throat.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.249
Yeah, l have this thing
about men cutting

03:29.334 --> 03:31.251
or threatening
to cut my throat.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.212
Don't try to
cut my throat.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.757
Jo, l don't know how
things work in Florida,
which from your description

03:36.841 --> 03:39.927
sounds like a colorful,
lawless swamp,

03:40.136 --> 03:43.972
but here it takes
two men to do one job,

03:44.432 --> 03:46.058
where in Florida,
it might take

03:46.142 --> 03:48.268
one very strong
woman to do such a job.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.728
Whoa. Whoa.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.232
l'll take over.
Um, what we're
doing here,

03:53.316 --> 03:55.651
Michael handles
more of the big
picture stuff,

03:55.735 --> 03:58.111
and l handle more of
the day-to-day stuff.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.488
Yeah.
JlM: So, together. . .

03:59.572 --> 04:01.240
l think l understand.
All right.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.283
Each of you is
doing half a job.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.993
No.
(CHUCKLES) And sometimes
l can hardly handle that.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.203
(JO CHUCKLlNG)

04:06.287 --> 04:09.164
Now this is knucklehead talk.
l'm not going to abide it,
you know.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.709
You can't give me gravy
and tell me it's jelly,
'cause gravy ain't sweet.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.461
ls it, Jim?
(SOFTLY)
l don't think so.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.629
Michael?

04:15.713 --> 04:16.797
Forget the question.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.258
l think one of you
should return to Sales,

04:19.342 --> 04:21.343
and the other one
will be a manager.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.429
l humbly accept
the management position.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.597
Why would you just
automatically get it?

04:25.682 --> 04:29.685
Because, well, Jim,
where l'm from, there
are two types of folk,

04:29.769 --> 04:33.563
those who ain't and those
who are knee-high on
a grasshopper.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.484
Which type ain't you ain't?
Y'all come back now.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.238
Do you even know
what that means?
Yes.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.448
Well, l'm gonna
let this marinate.
So you can go.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.616
Um. . .

04:44.701 --> 04:46.451
You can go on.
Yeah.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.287

and Truman Capote
and I slept with three
of the same guys.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.881
When l was a little girl,
l was terrified to fly,

04:59.966 --> 05:01.925
and now I have my
own pilot's license.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.927
l am CEO of
Sabre lnternational

05:04.012 --> 05:07.764
and l sell the best damn
printers and all-in-one
machines Korea can make.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.890
Pleased to meet you.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.142
(EXCLAlMS) Traffic jam.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.185

There's blood everywhere.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.152
Um, l got you
a Valentine's card.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.778
You did?
Yeah.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.656
(EXCLAlMS) A bird and a dog !

05:24.741 --> 05:26.491
Yeah, well,
it's Snoopy
and Woodstock.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.659
You named them?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.119
Uh, Charles Schulz did.

05:29.912 --> 05:30.912
l thought it was relevant

05:30.997 --> 05:33.081
'cause l got you all
those birds for Christmas,
remember?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.877
Yeah, l do remember.
Oh, they love each other.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.379
Oh, look at that.
They sure do.
l hadn't noticed.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.673
Oh, it smells
really good, too.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.133
Yeah, it's
Roger Federer for Men.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.676
l sprayed
some in there.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.637
Andy, whoa!
Thank you very much.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.514
lt's got pheromones
in it. (CHUCKLES)

JO: Hey.
KEVlN: Hi.

05:51.976 --> 05:56.104
Just choosing seats,
not getting married.
Chop, chop, little onion.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.106
Jo, there's books
in my chair.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.524
That's right, darling.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.861
Now you're
the proud new owner
of a Sabre handbook,

06:02.945 --> 06:04.780
and my autobiography.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.241
Now, you all must be
in a tizzy. l can see
it on your faces.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.578
l mean, what's going on now?
l mean, who owns
Dunder Mifflin?

06:11.662 --> 06:14.498
Right? l mean, Sabre?
What's that?

06:14.999 --> 06:18.960
Some company
we never heard of from
down in Tallahassee?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.671
l mean, where is that?
Near Mars?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.548
No, we know. Texas.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.468
Now, Dunder Mifflin
has an arm's reach

06:26.552 --> 06:29.137
into all these
small businesses
all over the northeast,

06:29.305 --> 06:31.723
and now we're gonna
take that arm

06:32.100 --> 06:36.395
and we're going to
start selling printers.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.896
l could manage my
way around that.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.815
They're the easiest-to-use
printers in the market.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.401
l will try to
manage my excitement.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.488
l have been saying
the word "manager" a lot,

06:46.572 --> 06:49.658
so whenever Jo
thinks manager,
she thinks of me.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.245
Camel cigarettes
did the same thing
with Joe Camel

06:53.329 --> 06:55.205
by making him
look like a penis.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.041
l can't even go
near a cigarette now

06:58.126 --> 07:00.627
without thinking of
a penis, and vice versa.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.380
l think that's it.
So we're all good.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.257
Okay.
Thanks, y'all.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.808
Oh, my God.

07:15.351 --> 07:19.020
l guess Andy likes me.
l never thought
of him in that way.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.981
But l guess in most
romantic comedies,

07:21.065 --> 07:22.566
the guy you're
supposed to be
with is the one

07:22.650 --> 07:24.317
that you never
thought of in that way.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.196
You might have even thought
he was annoying or
possibly homosexual.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.865
So check this out.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.367
According to the handbook,
you could make more money

07:32.452 --> 07:34.035
as a salesman
than as a manager.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.163
They have all these
incentive programs.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.789
l ran your numbers
from last year.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.708
This is way more
than l make now.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.960
l don't think
l'm gonna miss
being manager.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.795
You know how some people
say they're not in it
for the money?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.755
Well, with all due
respect to this job,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.966
l think l'm definitely
in it for the money.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.926
And, quite honestly,
the women.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.304
Hey. Got a second?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.472
Sure.
All right.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.349
You here to tell me
that you think l would
be a better manager,

07:56.434 --> 07:58.977
and that you are sorry
for being such a jerk?

07:59.061 --> 08:00.562
Actually, yeah.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.565
What?
Exactly that.

08:03.649 --> 08:08.069
l think that you absolutely
deserve the manager position
more than l do.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.615
What? Really?
Yeah.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.242
(LAUGHlNG) Wow! Wow!

08:14.827 --> 08:15.952

Hello, Oscar.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.080
Michael, reading.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.165
What are you reading?

08:20.249 --> 08:21.291
The AtIantic.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.543
Oh, that is
my favorite ocean.
l love it.

08:23.628 --> 08:27.714
l'm so happy right now.
No, l can't keep it
a secret any longer.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.299
Jim's stepping
down to salesman.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.635
l am going to be
the sole manager
once again.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.678
(SlGHS) l should step
into Sales myself.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.097
Why? ls there an
untapped gay market?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.767
Sabre has no caps
on commissions.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.977
He can make a lot
more money in Sales.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.146
(SlGHlNG)

08:44.524 --> 08:45.690
(CLlCKS TONGUE)

08:46.484 --> 08:47.734
Where did you get
that information?

08:47.818 --> 08:50.237
Manual.
Manuel who?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.823
Mmm-hmm.
Well, according to
the manual,

08:53.908 --> 08:56.117
there is no cap
on commissions.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.953
l have been hustled.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.498
(SOFTLY) Son of a bitch.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.416
JlM: This is. . .
Pardon me.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.168
Speak of the devil.
We were just
talking about you.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.711
Have a seat.
Okay.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.798
Now, Jim here is thinking
about taking himself

09:09.924 --> 09:11.550
out of the running
for being manager.
Yep.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.720
Oh, really?
(EXCLAlMS) That is
so sweet of you !

09:16.472 --> 09:20.350
But l cannot accept,
because l have been
thinking about it,

09:20.810 --> 09:22.811
and l think l want
to go back to Sales.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.104
Really?
JlM: Really?

09:24.188 --> 09:26.022
Yeah, you can take the man
out of the salesman,

09:26.107 --> 09:28.275
but you can't take
the sales out of salesman.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.068
Well, l think you're both
being a little too modest.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.905
No, l really, really
think Michael is better
at being manager

09:33.990 --> 09:35.448
for so many reasons.
Mmm-mmm.

09:35.533 --> 09:40.620
No. l think l would be bad.
l would sleep in my office. . .

09:40.746 --> 09:42.706
JO: Okay.
. . .and l would
sexually harass people.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.749
Why would you do that?
l'm turning myself
in right now.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.003
You know, Michael,
you have more experience
in sales and management,

09:48.087 --> 09:49.754
so l'm going to defer
to your judgment.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.922
Thank you.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.466
l think you will
become the salesman,

09:53.551 --> 09:55.760
and congratulations,

09:55.845 --> 09:58.346
you're gonna be
the new manager
of this branch.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.099
That's great.
Congratulations.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.352
Have fun signing my
commission checks, boss.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.523
(EXCLAlMS)

10:08.608 --> 10:11.985
Michael marked his heights.
He's grown.

Listen, he's been promoted
to sole manager.

10:22.997 --> 10:27.334
We have got to step
this up. Meet me behind

You're 20 minutes late.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.258
Um, l was
at another dumpster.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.844
Just admit you
lost track of time.
(SlGHS)

10:38.095 --> 10:41.806
DWlGHT: Ryan and I have been
meeting up to work on our
diabolical plot against Jim.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.476
Ryan is always late
for our meetings.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.853
l wish l had a lair.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.147
Did you see Saw?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.775
Of course l seesaw.
Mose and l seesaw
all the time.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.653
No, the movie.
Did you see
the movie Saw?

10:55.029 --> 10:58.657
Oh. Yeah. Great film.
Almost as fun as
going on a seesaw.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.701
Okay. The reason these
movies are so popular. . .
Mmm-hmm.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.537
. . .is the element of
psychological torment.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.832
l like where you're
going with this.
Continue.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.960
Could we lure him
into an old warehouse
or something?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.754
l have an old barn.
lt's kind of smelly.
Yes.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.673
But that might be a plus.
And then what?
Okay.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.883
We do what they
did in Saw.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.847
l mean, we don't
kill him, obviously.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.890
l have a mask.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.016
Okay, that's your idea?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.935
Exactly like in the movie?

11:27.019 --> 11:29.854
That is the most
idiotic thing l have
ever heard in my life.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.398
Well, suggest something
else then. Don't just. . .

11:31.482 --> 11:32.732
Are you supposed
to cut his leg off?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.109
Don't just
criticize my idea!
Think!

11:34.193 --> 11:36.319
You think of
something then.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.282
Michael, l'm worried that
not all your toys are gonna
fit on your new desk.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.617
How is that possible?

11:42.702 --> 11:45.370
Well, in your old office,
there were all those ledges
and extra space.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.289
No excuses, Erin, come on.
Make it happen.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.834
You know, l actually
think that l should
get back to work.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.003
Jim asked me to
do some stuff,
and he's manager.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.382
Oh, yeah, fine, fine.
Leave it here.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.550

MlCHAEL: l have to make
some sales anyway.

with my magic
sales fingers?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.973
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

12:09.311 --> 12:10.770
Michael Scott,
Head of Sales.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.315
You gotta do
something, man.
You can't just sit there.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.448
The new lT guy. Nick.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.574
Nick.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.618
l think he's the key.
He's very trusting.
He's looking for friends.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.912
He's been given
an awesome amount
of power,

12:27.997 --> 12:29.748
and does not know
how to wield it.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.082
Like Frodo.

12:31.667 --> 12:36.087
Why don't you just let me
handle the Tolkien references,
okay, dumb jock?

12:36.464 --> 12:39.507
Well, l think
he can be corrupted.
Like Gollum.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.928
Smeagol was corrupted
and became Gollum.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.223
l might start
a diabolical plot
against him after this one.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.226
Who's hungry?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.352
What is that?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.938
lt's ants on a log.
Michael would always have me
bring them in at 2:30

12:54.023 --> 12:55.899
and say, "Who's hungry?"

12:55.983 --> 12:58.318
(CHUCKLES) Oh. l'm fine.
Thank you, though.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.737
Do you want me to
spin you in your chair
and make you dizzy?

13:00.821 --> 13:01.988
Why would l
want to do that?

13:02.072 --> 13:04.824
lt's a thinking technique.
All the top executives
do it.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.203
lt keeps the brain moving,
and a spinning brain's
a working brain.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.289
For now l'm just gonna
go back to work here.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.707
Oh, sure.
Yeah, thank you.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.000
Well. . .

lt will be a pleasure
doing business with you.
Thanks. Bye, bye.

The gentlemen's club
in Carbondale.

lt is called Curves.
l went by there
the other day,

13:31.143 --> 13:34.187
saw some of
the women walking in.
Not really my cup of tea.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.356
Actually, Kevin,
you might like it.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.524

don't announce out loud
our sales that much.

the sales experience.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.011
"Friends are worth sharing
a dog house with."

14:07.096 --> 14:10.682

that Andy gave Kelly
such a romantic card.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.475

compete with her.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.771
That girl can sing
and dance and gets all of
her clothes at the mall.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.942
And l feel like such a fool
for thinking that Andy was
only going after one girl,

14:21.151 --> 14:24.946
because Andy Bernard
is a playboy.
And why shouldn't he be?

the best things about
being an lT guy is,

14:38.919 --> 14:41.170
you get to know everyone's

a little problem here.

named Jim Halpert,

14:50.973 --> 14:52.724

terrible things. Okay?

He's molesting people
via the lnternet,
and we need to stop him.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.314

should call the cops.

his password like that.
