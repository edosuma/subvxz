Look, you said I didn't need
the surgery right now.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.597
Right now and never
are two very different things,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.725
plus that was two months
and three failed attempts

08:36.725 --> 08:37.809

08:37.809 --> 08:39.269

fantastic, really.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.567

which supplies blood

08:45.567 --> 08:47.652
to all of your major organs.
If it bursts--

08:47.652 --> 08:49.070
I know, okay?
You told me.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.321
But those consent forms,

08:50.321 --> 08:52.323
they say
I could have renal failure

08:52.323 --> 08:54.701
or heart problems
or bleed out during surgery.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.952
No, thanks.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.620
There is a less than
5% chance

08:57.620 --> 08:59.831
of renal failure, bleeding out,
or heart problems,

08:59.831 --> 09:01.833
but there is a 10% chance

09:01.833 --> 09:04.127
that your aneurysm will rupture
at any moment,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.379
and if that happens,
your chances of survival

09:06.379 --> 09:08.965
are worse than all
of these numbers combined.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.718
Okay, just stop.
Just stop.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.095
I don't know
about all the statistics,

09:14.095 --> 09:16.723

is that those consent forms

09:16.723 --> 09:18.892
say I could die
a dozen different ways

37:44.971 --> 37:46.598

eight weeks' vacation.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.933
- Eight weeks?
- Yeah.

38:05.450 --> 38:09.412

38:09.412 --> 38:11.414

38:28.723 --> 38:30.141

it's very last minute,
