00:03.461 --> 00:05.463
The V8s.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.924
- The T3s.

00:08.007 --> 00:08.883
- What happened
to your eyebrows?

00:08.967 --> 00:10.885
You look like
one of my dolls.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.888
- Yeah, the scary-looking one.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.640
- You mean Ophelia?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.270
- [shrieks]

00:20.353 --> 00:21.604
What are you doing here?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.148
Were you just spying on me?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.190
What did you hear?

00:24.274 --> 00:25.275
- Nothing.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.401
We didn't hear anything,
because--

00:26.484 --> 00:29.195
because...
- Tommy kept farting up a storm.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.864
- No, I didn't.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.156
- Disgusting.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.659
I said, were you spying on me?

00:34.743 --> 00:37.120
- I'll answer your question
with the same question.

00:37.203 --> 00:37.620
Were <i> you</i> spying?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.748
- Uh, no.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.168
I was walking to class,
minding my own business,

00:43.251 --> 00:46.421
when I just happened
to overhear a conversation.

00:46.504 --> 00:50.008
- "Overhear" is just a nice word
for "eavesdrop."

00:50.091 --> 00:51.134
- Or spying.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.969
- Well, at least
I go to school here,

00:53.052 --> 00:54.304
and you guys don't,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.514
which means you guys
came all the way over here

00:56.598 --> 00:57.724
just to spy.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.309
Now spill.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.435
- She's right, guys.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
We'd better tell her.

01:02.187 --> 01:02.228
- Yeah.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.984
- [chuckles softly]
Okay.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.402
First we heard a knock.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.820
- And then another knock.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.489
ROBERT: And then someone said,
"who's there?"

01:12.572 --> 01:14.032
MELANIE: And then someone else
said, "orange."

01:14.115 --> 01:15.992
and then the first someone
said,

01:16.075 --> 01:18.495
"orange you glad..."

01:18.578 --> 01:20.038
- What are you doing?

01:20.121 --> 01:22.165
- Just dropping a silent smiley.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.210
- Oh...that's awful!

01:25.293 --> 01:26.753
- Run!
- Agh!

01:26.836 --> 01:28.254
- My eyes!
It's burning!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.006

I'm fast
but not very coordinated.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.093
At my old school,
I ran the 100-meter dash

02:15.176 --> 02:16.177
the wrong way.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.680
- See?
That's what I mean.

Why did you run
from me like that?

02:23.184 --> 02:26.646
I mean, I thought
we kind of liked--

02:26.729 --> 02:27.564
- It's not that
I don't like you.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.482
I do.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.985
It's just that right now,

02:32.068 --> 02:33.570
it's not a good time.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.113
I can't go
to the dance with you.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.948
- Okay.
I get it.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.951
Is it because of Tony?

02:40.034 --> 02:40.201
- No!
I...

02:41.828 --> 02:43.621
I'm sorry.

02:49.002 --> 02:49.377
- This better be good.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.923
What happened to your...

02:54.007 --> 02:55.884
- Long story.
- Go on.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.510
Might as well bore me
with a long story.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.598
- I overheard a conversation
between Tony and Andi.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.225
They're preparing
for the eclipse and the party.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.019
I think they're planning
on line-dancing

03:06.102 --> 03:07.353
and stealing your powers.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.688
- That's impossible.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.398
- Well, they have the Hexoren.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.651
- Only three people signed up

03:13.735 --> 03:15.778
for the "Little Dance
on the Prairie."

03:15.862 --> 03:17.238
- Well, are you surprised?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.282
That theme is so old-fashioned.

03:19.365 --> 03:19.908
- Got any better ideas?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.201
- Yeah.
Anime.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.954
- Oh, we did animals last year,
and that bombed as well.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.122
- That's not what I meant.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.665
Anime,
like the Japanese comics.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.667
- Anime.
I like it.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.337
I'm officially
getting the theme changed.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.212
Excuse me.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.470
- So explain to me again
what Lily said,

03:40.553 --> 03:41.512
that I might not be
the Chosen One?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.724
- No, you are.
But so is the principal.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.142
You guys have to share powers
or something

03:46.225 --> 03:48.811
until one of you claims them all
during the eclipse, I think.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.771
- Interesting.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.440
- Lily was pretty sure

03:52.523 --> 03:54.275
you were the true Chosen One.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.611
And I was doing some research...

03:56.694 --> 03:57.362
- The hex!

03:57.445 --> 03:59.697
- Oh, down, boy.
Down.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.075
[sighs]

04:03.493 --> 04:04.452
And it said...

04:07.455 --> 04:10.041
that the Chosen One

04:10.124 --> 04:13.753
has a star-shaped birthmark.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.755
- But I don't have
any birthmarks.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.298
- Are you sure?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.969
I mean, we recently found out
you're a witch.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.846
Maybe you just didn't notice
the birthmark.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.014
- I would've noticed.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.849
- What if it's on your head
or somewhere

04:26.933 --> 04:28.977
and you've just never seen it
because of the hair?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
- I guess.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.065
But I'd have to shave my head
to find it.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.277
Don't even think about it.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.570
- Fine.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.240
Well, the Hexoren is yours.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.908
And if the witches' council
went through all the trouble

04:43.992 --> 04:46.536
of sending Lily to protect you,

04:46.619 --> 04:49.706
then you most likely
are still the Chosen One.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.915
- What do we do now?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.208
- I have an idea.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.461
- It better not have anything
to do with me shaving my head.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.725
- Hello!

05:08.808 --> 05:10.393
No, I don't want to buy

05:10.476 --> 05:13.896
any cookies or candy bars
or magazine subscriptions.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.064
But if you're selling husbands,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.608
I'll take a tall,
handsome, funny one.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.484
[chortles and snorts]

05:18.568 --> 05:20.486
- No, I'm not selling anything.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.406
I'm Andi.
I go to school with Maddie.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.909
- Right.
You're Emma's sidekick.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.828
- Me? No way.
I'm not a sidekick.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.748
I'm a kick,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.584

05:37.211 --> 05:41.007
- Can I help you
with something?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.092
- I need to talk to you

05:43.176 --> 05:45.428
about Maddie and the eclipse.

05:45.511 --> 05:50.475
- Oh, you mean that store
in the mall

05:50.558 --> 05:53.519
that sells
only black clothing.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.938
- I'm talking about
the Chosen One, the Hexoren,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.274
the stealing of powers,
the whole enchilada.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.317
- How do you know about that?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.693
You're not a witch.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.779
And this is a complete
and total violation

06:02.862 --> 06:04.405

related to the magic--

06:05.573 --> 06:06.783
- You and I have
a lot to talk about.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.452
- And if the council
finds out about this,

06:09.535 --> 06:12.330
I don't want them thinking
that I had anything to do

06:12.413 --> 06:14.749

about an adolescent...

06:14.832 --> 06:17.085

I had a decent vocabulary.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.518

06:33.601 --> 06:35.144
Don't get offended,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.979
but I don't understand
half of you.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.234
Are you saying
I'm not the only one?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.613
Good.
That makes me feel better.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.579
- So what did you find out?

06:53.663 --> 06:56.958
- Okay, there appears to be
some kind of "magic book"

06:57.041 --> 06:59.168
they're trying to keep hidden,
Emma and Andi.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.753
- And Tony sometimes.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.171
He's not always with them.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.881
He also does magic a lot.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.007
Well, tries to do magic.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.260
- And Emma's been chosen
for something.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.761
- We're not sure what it is,

07:08.845 --> 07:11.013
but I hope it's to be on
one of those reality TV shows,

07:11.097 --> 07:12.807
you know, where you have
to eat slugs for money.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.560
- And it all goes down
the night of the eclipse.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.853
- Anything else?

07:16.936 --> 07:19.689
- Oh, yes.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.566

07:30.992 --> 07:32.243
all: A witch!

07:32.326 --> 07:35.413
Hey, we agreed
that I was gonna say it!

07:35.496 --> 07:36.372
No, me!

07:36.455 --> 07:38.166
[kids arguing]

07:38.249 --> 07:40.209
- So you're a witch
with no powers,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.587
so you're a guardian.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.424
- Recently appointed
Maddie's guardian, yes.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.675
The Chosen One.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.386
- Um, you know
she's not it, right?

07:50.469 --> 07:52.763
- I don't know that for sure.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.265
- The whole thing
is just crazy,

07:54.348 --> 07:57.435
that someone can just suddenly
take the Chosen One's power.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.270
- It isn't suddenly, dear.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.065
This kind of eclipse happens
only once every 300 years.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.567
With that kind of power
at stake,

08:04.650 --> 08:06.777
inevitably there's going
to be a battle,

08:06.861 --> 08:09.280
a battle between
good and evil,

08:09.363 --> 08:14.368
a battle that will define
the future of the magic realm.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.245
A battle--
- Are you reading off that book?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.165
- Well, we're prepared, anyway.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.666
We even have coordinating
outfits picked out.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.754
- I'm not worried
about you two.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.172
There's a bigger problem:

08:26.255 --> 08:27.215
the principal.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.090
- The principal?
Why?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.468
- Don't you know?

08:30.551 --> 08:34.096
The principal's a witch,
an evil former Chosen One.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.597
And she's after them.

08:35.681 --> 08:35.722
Here.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.145
<i>Look her up.</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:43.522
<i>or "Felicity Bumpermidge."</i>

08:43.606 --> 08:45.524
- Those are terrible
witch aliases.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.860
- I know.
But she's dangerous.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.111
<i>And she's trying to use Maddie</i>

08:49.195 --> 08:50.863
to steal
the Chosen One's powers.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.240
- Even if that were true,

08:52.323 --> 08:55.284
Maddie would never listen
to her over me.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.496
- Have you heard nothing
about teenage rebellion?

08:58.579 --> 09:00.998
We love to not listen
to our parents.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.961
- Yoo-hoo!
Nurse Lily!

09:07.546 --> 09:09.215
You here?

09:09.298 --> 09:10.549
Hmm.
No one's here.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.927
I should go check
the bathroom.

09:14.845 --> 09:15.638
[door closes]

09:18.474 --> 09:20.476
Aha!
I found you.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.020
[gasps]
And with my book!

09:23.104 --> 09:25.564
- Listen, Maddie,
we don't have to be enemies.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.066
- You're kidding, right?

09:27.149 --> 09:29.485
You stole my boyfriend,
you want to steal my powers,

09:29.568 --> 09:30.152
and you like bohemian chic.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.613
How are we not enemies?

09:32.697 --> 09:36.158
- Uh, we both like...

09:36.242 --> 09:37.785
mint chocolate chip ice cream?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.328
- I hate
mint chocolate chip.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.913
- Shoot.
Thought that was a gimme.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.249
'Cause seriously, who doesn't
like mint chocolate chip?

09:43.332 --> 09:44.333
- Give me the book!

09:44.417 --> 09:45.334
- Lower your voice
before you scare it

09:45.418 --> 09:47.628
and it flies off again.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.005
- I'm surprised
it hasn't flown away

09:49.088 --> 09:50.840
at the scary sight of your face.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.633
Give me the book!
- No, you!

09:52.717 --> 09:54.176
You're gonna rip it!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.016
- Let go!

10:02.184 --> 10:03.185
- Okay.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.648
- Look at what you did!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.734
- It's fine.
It's just a little wet--

10:12.778 --> 10:14.405
What?
There's two!

10:14.488 --> 10:15.615
- Oh, really,
captain obvious?

10:18.492 --> 10:19.535
- And another!

10:20.286 --> 10:24.081
[both screaming]

10:32.590 --> 10:34.050
- Is it over?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.426
- I think so.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.218
- [yelps]

10:36.302 --> 10:38.804
- It's okay.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.722
Don't be scared.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.641
- I'm not.
I'm just--

10:42.725 --> 10:43.893
I'm just making sure

10:43.976 --> 10:46.896
that if they attack us,
they get you first.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.398
- You really are always plotting
how to get your way, aren't you?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.150
- It's one of
my many great qualities.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.738
How did this happen?

10:56.989 --> 10:58.324
- I think it was the water.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.911
When it got wet,
it started multiplying.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.622
- That's all it takes
to make copies

11:04.705 --> 11:06.665
of the Magicrum's
most important book?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.084
- I know.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.294
Someone really dropped the ball
on that one.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.716
- So which one is
the real hexisketch?

11:18.761 --> 11:18.844
- I don't know.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.640
Looks like
they're all the same.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.433
- Well, you can't have any.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.727
They're all mine.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.646
- Uh, I'm pretty sure
there's enough to go around.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.774
- But they all belong
to one person:

11:31.857 --> 11:33.359
me, the Chosen One.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.945
So paws off, Alonso.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.738
- Wait.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.614
You think you're the Chosen One?

11:38.697 --> 11:41.450
- I know I'm the Chosen One.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.286
I mean, I'm smart,
beautiful, brave--

11:44.370 --> 11:45.371
ah!

11:46.872 --> 11:47.581
- It was just
another Hexoren.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.791
- That one's mine too.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.132
- I think they're done.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.301
We're safe now.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.053
- Oh, are you?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.227
- This is amazing.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.399
They're all exact copies.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.400
- Told you.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.359
- "Told you."

12:15.443 --> 12:17.903
So childish.
So you.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.989
- Of course,
they all belong to Maddie.

12:20.072 --> 12:20.865
- Told you.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.496
- Well, then I should be going.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.165
School is out...

12:30.750 --> 12:31.834
And I have to go home.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.669
- Don't take another step.

12:33.752 --> 12:39.091
- Yeah, right.
Not one more.

12:40.176 --> 12:40.759
- Wow.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.262
This solves most of my--

12:43.345 --> 12:46.182
I mean, our problems.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.434
- Now I have everything
for my coronation.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.686
- Yes, we have everything.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.940
But it seems we have too much.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.530
- Hello, hello.
Over.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.283
Witches' council,
do you hear me? Over.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.202
This is Andi Cruz.
Over.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.495
- What you doing?
- What?

13:07.578 --> 13:08.621
Uh, nothing.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.915
Why are you here?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.583
- What's all this?
Looks cool.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.543
- Yeah.
Don't touch that.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.213
It's my science project.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.925
Yeah, I'm taking apart
my dad's old C.B. radio

13:21.008 --> 13:23.135
and juicing it up
to talk to Russia.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.846
- Again?
You did that last year.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.474
Besides, that's what
the internet's for.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.808
- Yeah, I know.
Now give me that.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.310
- What are they?

13:31.393 --> 13:34.313
And don't tell me
they're for a science project.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.566
- Well, they're my...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.568
new glasses.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.819
I need them to see.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.741
Oh, there, I can see.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.284
See ya.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.410
both: Oh!

13:53.165 --> 13:53.916
[screams]

13:58.212 --> 14:00.589
Uh, thanks, Coach.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.804
- It's a witch catcher.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.683
It looks like a dream catcher,
but it catches witches.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.978
- Emma is not a witch.
Witches don't exist.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.105
- But we heard them say
that the book was...

14:16.188 --> 14:18.732
- Special.
Well, or spackled.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.526
I couldn't really hear.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.860
- What they were saying
was true. Trust us.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.612
- You can ask Katie.
She was there.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.948
- I don't have to ask anyone.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.491
Emma is not a witch.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.247
- Come on.
I don't have all day.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.874
- You have parent-teacher
conferences or something?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.418
- No,<i> Fangs McGee</i>
<i>the Bounty Hunter</i> is on

14:37.501 --> 14:39.753
in half an hour.

14:39.837 --> 14:40.838
- Maybe we should keep one
as a backup?

14:40.921 --> 14:44.300
- No.
There's only one Hexoren.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.927
- Like there's only one
Chosen One.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.430
- So both of you think
that Maddie--

14:49.513 --> 14:50.639
how do you know?
- That's classified.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.765
- The principal told
Coach Julio,

14:51.849 --> 14:52.474
who told the nurse Lily,
who told the principal,

14:52.558 --> 14:54.310
who told me.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.981
- The Chosen One shall have
no tolerance for gossip

14:59.064 --> 15:01.025
and sharing said gossip
with the enemy.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.028
- I won't say anything.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.197
- I don't believe you,

15:07.281 --> 15:09.241
and now I don't need you
either...

15:10.534 --> 15:11.994
Now that I know who
the Chosen One is.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.954
- Me!
I get a pageant and everything.

15:14.038 --> 15:14.079
Move, move.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.668
- Maddie, she's playing you.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.462
She wants you to think
you're the Chosen One

15:21.545 --> 15:23.714
so she can use you.
- Shh!

15:23.797 --> 15:25.674
The Chosen One's busy
right now.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.344
- She's a conniving old witch
who turned Lily into a frog.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.471
- I had to get her
out of my way.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.513
She was gonna help Emma
steal your powers.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.724
- She's lying.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.685
- And now we have to get Emma
out of your way.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.938
- Yes, Emma, out of the way.
Tell me how.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.858
- You vaporize her.
- What?

15:42.941 --> 15:44.735
- I-I don't think
I know that spell.

15:44.818 --> 15:48.364
- Oh, it's easy.
All you do is--

15:48.447 --> 15:48.989
- No!

15:49.073 --> 15:52.451
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

16:01.502 --> 16:04.838
What did you--

16:04.922 --> 16:05.881
why did you--

16:05.964 --> 16:08.258
- I did what had to be done.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.928
I had to make sure
she wasn't the Chosen One.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.597
- By disintegrating her?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.015
- If she were the Chosen One,

16:15.099 --> 16:16.975
her reflexes
would have saved her.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.523
Don't look so scared.
It's so unbecoming.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.120
The things I have to do.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.468
- What did I do?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.347
- Maddie Winky, I'm off to--

16:56.557 --> 16:57.641
What's wrong?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.406
- This is all your fault!
- What?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.282
- You lied to me about being
in the guardian.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.784
- Maddie, I didn't lie
to you.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.786
Honey,
what are you talking about?

17:17.869 --> 17:19.872
- The principal turned Emma
into dust.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.256
- Ursula, hi.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.886
Do we have rhyming book club
tonight?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.304
I don't have anything
really prepared,

17:35.387 --> 17:36.638
but you know what?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.558
I have a tuna and onion
casserole I made last night.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.478
- Oh, Francisco,
we're so sorry.

17:42.561 --> 17:46.523
[sobbing]

17:46.607 --> 17:49.067
- Why?
W-w-what happened?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.236
- You're so brave.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.404
- I am?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.489
- Yes.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.284
He's in shock.
Poor thing.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.452
- What happened?

17:59.578 --> 18:01.079
- Francisco,

18:01.163 --> 18:04.333
I-I'm just going
to come out with it.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.085
It's Emma.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.003
She's gone!

18:08.086 --> 18:09.463
[sobbing]

18:09.546 --> 18:12.257
- [laughing]

18:12.341 --> 18:17.054
Oh, man, Ursula's here
with Maddie,

18:17.137 --> 18:19.348
and they think you've been--
poof.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.432
- Oh, we have to tell them
I'm okay!

18:20.516 --> 18:24.353
- No, wait.
They're both here.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.771
- Yeah?

18:25.854 --> 18:28.273
- That means
their house is empty.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.068
- Probably?

18:31.151 --> 18:32.444
- Think more wickedly
than that, will you?

18:32.528 --> 18:37.074
Like you said, we have to find
Maddie's Achilles heel,

18:37.157 --> 18:39.368
and if she has one,
it's in that trunk.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.870
- I said heart.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.997
Find Maddie's heart,
not Achilles heel.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.707
- Ah, heart, Achilles heel.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.583
They're like the same thing
in Greek mythology.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.418
Come on.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.298
- See?

18:53.382 --> 18:57.010
She is right here...

18:58.011 --> 19:00.430
- Oh.
[crying]

19:00.514 --> 19:04.393
You must be in
the following stage of grief,

19:04.476 --> 19:06.228
hallucination.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.857
- Uh, Emma!

19:09.940 --> 19:10.941
Emma.

19:12.109 --> 19:16.071
Maybe she just stepped away
for a moment.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.156
- [sobbing]

19:22.452 --> 19:24.163
- Andi, what's taking so long?

19:24.246 --> 19:24.872
- Almost--I almost have it.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.083
Just a tad bit longer.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.377
- You said that
ten minutes ago.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.587
Okay.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.130
We've got to get in.
No time to waste.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.173
So open the door
right now in haste.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.207
It just seems so...

20:09.291 --> 20:09.708
personal.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.919
- I know.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.171
I hope we find an embarrassing
baby picture of her.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.425
<i>MAC: I need to find</i>
<i>something...</i>

20:20.761 --> 20:23.263
<i>Anything that the principal</i>
<i>might have about Kanays.</i>

20:23.347 --> 20:25.307
Hmm, this seems interesting,

20:25.390 --> 20:27.392
like some sort
of torture device.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.894
- It's an eyelash curler.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.687
Gigi has one.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.648
- It must be Miss Pitch's.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.857
How does it work?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.651
- Well, you hold it
with these two ends.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.778
Then you put your eyelashes
between those--yep--

20:37.861 --> 20:39.321
and then you close it.
Yep.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.865
- Ah! Ow!
It <i> is</i> a torture device.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.158
- Just pop it back open.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.494
- I can't.
It's stuck.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.995
- [sighs] Give me.
Just give me.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.414
Come here.
Just let it go.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.290
Just give me--

20:56.588 --> 20:58.048
- Diego!

20:58.131 --> 20:59.841
Diego, are you okay?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.301
<i>DIEGO: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.</i>

21:01.385 --> 21:04.012
- Step back.
I'm coming through.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.359
Whoa.

21:17.442 --> 21:17.484
- Wow.

21:19.403 --> 21:19.903
I didn't expect this.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.989
- Me neither.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.032
It's just a photo.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.450
EMMA: This must be her dad.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.453
That's all she has in here.
- I know.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.330
I have tons of pictures
with my dad--

21:32.124 --> 21:33.458
oh.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.544
Now you're just making me
feel bad for her.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.337
- This must be her only one.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.797
We shouldn't be doing this.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.632
This is wrong and private
and all sorts of--

21:40.716 --> 21:42.926
[sighs]

21:43.010 --> 21:44.261
- Yeah, I'm not used
to feeling bad for Maddie,

21:44.344 --> 21:45.846
and I def don't like it.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.888
DANIEL: Emma?

21:46.972 --> 21:49.266
- Daniel?
- What are you doing here?

21:49.349 --> 21:51.143
And why are you going
through Maddie's stuff?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.311
- Well, we can explain.

21:55.397 --> 21:55.480
- Daniel?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.900
What are you doing here?
