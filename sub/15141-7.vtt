00:53.420 --> 00:56.190
This is so humiliating.
Let's just get out of here.

Hell, no, we're gonna

Something wrong?

01:17.110 --> 01:19.146
I told you,
it's complicated.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.220
You're not helping,
 mujer.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.754
You're gonna throw
your back out,

01:28.021 --> 01:29.756

Yes, it will.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.644
If not Nic,
then someone else.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.446
You hate me.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.616
You know I don't.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.620
So are we okay?

10:53.686 --> 10:55.355
No.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.459
Not while you're
screwing my brother.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.429
( sighs )

11:07.267 --> 11:09.502
CECI:
You guys got this.
Don't worry about it.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.304
I believe in you all.
You can do it.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.072
I love you.
You're gonna do great.

11:13.139 --> 11:16.009
Now get out there
and kick some ass!

11:16.075 --> 11:18.011

12:25.545 --> 12:28.081
( locker clanks )

12:28.147 --> 12:30.516
Hey, Nic.
Hey.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.218
What's up with your phone?

12:32.285 --> 12:34.120
I been texting you,
and you don't hit me back.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.455
We need to talk.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.023
Oh.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.293
That line.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.428
That's never good.
You dropping me?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.164
Look, we hooked up,
and it was cool and all, but--

12:45.231 --> 12:48.401
And it's only gonna get
even better.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.504
That's what
I'm afraid of.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.273
I don't want
to hurt you.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.141
Too late.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.509
Wait!
What?

12:56.576 --> 12:57.777
Can we still kick it?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.612
Nah, I don't play
that game.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.748
Oh, so we can't be friends
if we're not hooking up?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.417
I have enough friends.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.691
( audience cheering inside )

13:11.758 --> 13:15.395
MALE EMCEE:

13:16.663 --> 13:18.197
Whoo!
You did it!

13:18.264 --> 13:19.399
Good job, ladies!
Yes!

13:19.465 --> 13:22.335
Oh, my God!
You turned it around!

Huddle up!

13:30.677 --> 13:32.445
I wanna get a picture.
Get in there.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.014
All right, guys, say cheese.
GIRL 1: Cheese!

13:35.081 --> 13:37.016

I want to post them.

( students chattering )

14:06.091 --> 14:07.959
I love career day.

14:08.026 --> 14:09.994
There's so many things
I'm good at.

14:10.061 --> 14:13.765
I could be a doctor
or a lawyer...

14:13.832 --> 14:15.100
What about
a Laker Girl?

14:15.166 --> 14:17.769
Then you could marry
a doctor or a lawyer.

14:17.836 --> 14:19.871
Dream big.

14:19.938 --> 14:22.340
That sounds great. Okay.
Look forward to seeing you.

14:25.376 --> 14:29.414
And last week I was in London,
and next week I'll be in Rome.

14:29.481 --> 14:30.882
And so can you.

14:30.949 --> 14:32.884
GIRL: Cool.
( school bell rings )

14:35.220 --> 14:37.822
JULIANA:
You guys have a great day.

14:37.889 --> 14:39.891
And make sure to check out
our website.

14:41.292 --> 14:43.428
How old do you have to be
to be a flight attendant?

14:43.495 --> 14:45.096
Eighteen years old.

14:45.163 --> 14:46.331
I'll be 18 next month.

14:46.397 --> 14:48.433
Is it hard to get in?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.068
Hablas español?

14:50.135 --> 14:51.436
Claro que si.

14:51.503 --> 14:53.204
Right there,
you're ahead of the pack.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.340
You should
take one of these.

14:55.406 --> 14:57.408
WOMAN ( over PA ):
 This is a reminder
to all students,

14:57.475 --> 14:59.944
especially juniors
and seniors,

15:00.011 --> 15:03.081
to participate
in this year's Career Fair Day.

15:03.148 --> 15:05.316
You really think a girl
from East Los

15:05.383 --> 15:06.751
could be
a flight attendant?

15:06.818 --> 15:09.954
Why not?
I'm from B.H.

15:10.021 --> 15:11.790
Beverly Hills?

15:11.856 --> 15:14.292
No! Boyle Heights.

15:14.359 --> 15:17.262
Really?
Mm-hm.

15:17.328 --> 15:20.398
Wow.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.801
I just wish
I could get out of here.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.270
I feel like
nobody gets me.

15:25.336 --> 15:27.172
My life's a mess here.

15:27.238 --> 15:29.774
Well, flying away
isn't gonna help with that.

15:31.142 --> 15:33.511
Yeah, but at least
I'll be a mess in Paris.

15:33.745 --> 15:35.079
Have you been there?

15:35.146 --> 15:38.483
Shit, I've never been
nowhere.

15:38.750 --> 15:42.420
Don't worry.
You have plenty of time.

15:42.487 --> 15:43.922
Check these out.

15:44.989 --> 15:46.758
Ah, oui, oui!

15:46.825 --> 15:49.060
( chuckles ):
I do know that one.

15:49.127 --> 15:51.930
( school bell rings )

15:51.996 --> 15:53.531
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:53.798 --> 15:56.401
Why the hell haven't you replied
to any of my messages?

15:56.467 --> 15:58.503
I haven't been feeling
like myself today.

15:58.770 --> 16:01.806
Really?
What do you mean?

16:01.873 --> 16:04.108
I can't tell you.

16:04.175 --> 16:07.045
You can
tell me anything, babe.

16:07.111 --> 16:08.913
I know it's hard.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.448
Actually,
it's soft and runny.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.984
What?

16:13.051 --> 16:15.954
I have the shits.
Ew! Diego!

16:16.020 --> 16:17.789
It must have been
something I ate.

16:17.856 --> 16:20.792
( sighs ):
Or drank.

16:20.859 --> 16:21.993
( stomach growls )

16:22.060 --> 16:23.761
Oh, not again.

16:23.828 --> 16:25.430
( flatulence )

16:25.496 --> 16:28.299
I'm gonna kill
that bruja.

16:30.869 --> 16:32.237
Hey, Jocelyn, you want some?

16:32.303 --> 16:33.771
Nah, I'm not hungry.

16:33.838 --> 16:36.441
By the way, you don't
got to talk to Camila.

16:36.507 --> 16:38.309
She already
broke it down for me.

16:38.376 --> 16:40.378
What'd she say?

16:40.445 --> 16:42.814
You're her best friend,
like you don't know.

16:42.881 --> 16:46.417
I swear,
I don't.

16:46.484 --> 16:49.220
She's still hooked on that guy
that she was seeing before me.

16:51.489 --> 16:53.391
She said that?

16:53.458 --> 16:56.127
Pretty much.

16:56.194 --> 16:58.429
I'd sure like to know what
homeboy gots that I don't.

16:59.497 --> 17:02.433
Hm. I'm sorry, Nic,

17:02.500 --> 17:05.236
but maybe you're
better off without her.

17:07.438 --> 17:10.275
( grunting and crashing
in video game on TV )

17:13.544 --> 17:16.514
CECI:
Yay, you're back!

17:16.781 --> 17:18.383
Look who it is.

17:18.449 --> 17:20.518
There you go.

17:20.785 --> 17:23.488
Okay.
Hey, baby.

17:23.755 --> 17:25.223
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

17:25.290 --> 17:26.824
How was San Diego?

17:26.891 --> 17:29.761
( grunting and crashing
continues )

17:29.827 --> 17:34.399
I got some Hawaiian chicken.
Are you hungry?

17:34.465 --> 17:36.501
Sure you got that for me?

17:39.137 --> 17:41.139
( dramatic theme playing )

17:43.007 --> 17:45.243
Okay, I guess
I'll make you a plate.

17:50.348 --> 17:53.217
( Isela mumbles )

17:55.386 --> 17:59.090
CECI:
You hungry, baby girl?
It's coming in for a landing.

17:59.157 --> 18:01.059
( crying )

18:01.125 --> 18:03.962
Okay, I see how it is.

18:04.028 --> 18:05.763
( groans )

18:05.830 --> 18:07.198
I think she wants
a different pilot.

18:07.265 --> 18:09.100
She wants you
to feed her, babe.

18:11.469 --> 18:14.038
( objects shatter )
What is wrong with you?

18:14.105 --> 18:15.540
You're scaring the baby.
( Isela crying )

18:15.807 --> 18:18.109
Where are you going?
( door slams )

18:18.176 --> 18:20.011
I know, I know.

18:20.078 --> 18:21.813
It's okay.

18:24.916 --> 18:27.085
Shh.
It's okay, I know.

18:30.121 --> 18:33.124
( Latin music
playing over radio )

18:36.894 --> 18:38.129
( sighs )

18:38.196 --> 18:39.998
I broke things off
with Nic.

18:43.534 --> 18:45.303
I miss you.

18:47.338 --> 18:50.808
Why can't we just go back
to how things were?

18:50.875 --> 18:52.477
Until someone better
comes along?

18:53.911 --> 18:56.114
Why you gotta be
like that?

18:56.180 --> 18:58.916
Because I love you.

18:58.983 --> 19:00.952
And this is real for me.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.922
I'm into you
and only you.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.293
But, Joce,
we're only in high school.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.129
You're gonna go
off to college,

19:11.195 --> 19:14.932
and I want to travel
and see the world.

19:17.502 --> 19:19.437
Why can't we just be?

19:19.504 --> 19:21.239
Right here, right now.

19:21.305 --> 19:24.242
Because I don't wanna be
just friends with benefits.

19:26.878 --> 19:29.847
Well, I don't wanna make
promises I can't keep.

19:31.382 --> 19:33.951
You promised me nothing would
ever change our friendship.

19:34.018 --> 19:35.319
Yeah, well,
I guess I lied.

19:35.386 --> 19:38.356
Just like
you lie all the time.

19:46.464 --> 19:49.233
I want my money back, bruja.
 The love potion didn't work.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.437
How do you know?
Because ever since he drank it,

19:52.503 --> 19:54.205
he hasn't left his girlfriend
or the toilet.

19:54.272 --> 19:56.808
I told you
it wasn't FDA approved.

19:56.874 --> 19:59.043
( scoffs )
( sighs )

19:59.110 --> 20:01.379
I didn't think
we'd have to go there,

20:01.446 --> 20:03.281
but I'm afraid

20:03.347 --> 20:06.417
we are going to need
an even stronger spell.

20:06.484 --> 20:08.953
Even stronger?
Mm-hm.

20:09.020 --> 20:12.123
He'll end up at the hospital.
No, mensa.

20:12.190 --> 20:16.227
Bring me a photo
of the two of you, together.

20:16.294 --> 20:17.929
Tu sabes...

20:17.995 --> 20:19.964
Naked?
Mm-hm.

20:20.031 --> 20:23.167
I'm Miss Teen Yuma.
I have to protect my image.

20:23.234 --> 20:25.803
Do you want that boy
all to yourself or not?

20:28.973 --> 20:30.775
( knocks on door )

20:32.543 --> 20:34.745
( hip hop music playing
on stereo )

20:34.812 --> 20:36.147
What?

20:37.381 --> 20:39.016
Can I come in?

20:39.083 --> 20:40.351
What do you want?

20:47.925 --> 20:49.160
( camera clicks )

20:55.399 --> 20:56.901
( camera clicks )

21:05.376 --> 21:06.777
( camera clicks )

21:07.912 --> 21:09.180
CECI:
I don't know, Maya.

21:09.247 --> 21:10.815
One minute
he's bringing me flowers,

21:10.882 --> 21:12.517
and the next
he's pissed for no reason.

21:12.783 --> 21:15.419
It's freaking me out.
I gotta go.

21:15.486 --> 21:17.321
You were talking to Jacob,
weren't you?

21:17.388 --> 21:20.391
No! I was talking to Maya,
Jacob's girlfriend.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.960
Look, check for yourself.
I don't need to check anything.

21:23.027 --> 21:25.163
I know you're screwing him.
I don't even talk to him.

21:25.229 --> 21:26.430
It's only you, babe.
I swear.

21:26.497 --> 21:28.132
You sure about that?
Yes!

21:28.199 --> 21:29.534
Then what's this, perra?
What is this?

21:29.800 --> 21:30.968
Pedro, stop!
What is it?

21:31.035 --> 21:32.303
What's on this?
You're scaring me!

21:32.370 --> 21:33.804
Answer the question!
What is that?

21:33.871 --> 21:35.139
You're scaring me!
What do you see?

21:35.206 --> 21:36.374
It was for the yearbook!

21:36.440 --> 21:39.510
Ms. Alvarez took it
for the yearbook.

21:39.777 --> 21:42.079
( gasping )

21:42.146 --> 21:43.848
( grunting )

21:43.915 --> 21:45.483
Unh! Get off of me.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.352
