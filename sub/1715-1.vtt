You believe in loyalty,
don't you?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.146
Do l believe in loyalty?

00:22.223 --> 00:24.282
Especially
the kind of loyalty

00:24.359 --> 00:27.760
where an otherwise
sensible motherfucker
like myself

00:27.829 --> 00:30.525
put his own
best interests aside...
That's why you're my man.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.759
'Cause outside a goddamn dog,

00:33.501 --> 00:35.992

my kind of shit,

00:39.274 --> 00:41.174

01:38.166 --> 01:39.827
Faggot-ass redneck.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.863
What'd you say?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.700
Not you.
Some assholes on the elevator.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.741
Are these bitches
on a permanent
smoke break or what?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.870
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ho train
has left the station.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.311

01:53.381 --> 01:55.110
Good.
Skank-ass bitches.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.946
But that's the role
you wanted to play.

01:57.018 --> 01:59.179
Yeah, that says
a whoIe Iot about you.

01:59.254 --> 02:01.279
A ho, ho lot.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.094
Bitch, l'm about to ball this.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.972
Okay, then. Punk.

02:21.042 --> 02:22.304
No, it was not
made clear to me.

02:22.377 --> 02:23.401
This is the first
l'm hearing of it.

02:23.478 --> 02:25.673
Have you contacted
Agent Carruthers?

02:26.080 --> 02:29.174
Yeah, cell reception up here
is terrible, but until you
or l speak with him,

02:29.250 --> 02:31.081
he's the SAC and he's
the guy l answer to...

02:31.152 --> 02:32.551
REPORTER.: As to the identity
of the two bodies...

02:32.620 --> 02:34.144
Look, in less than an hour,
you're gonna have

02:34.222 --> 02:36.452
40 to 50-odd field agents
arriving in Lake Tahoe

02:36.524 --> 02:37.923
without the slightest clue
as to why.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.290
We are instructed
to take lsrael
into protective custody.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.487
That's a two-man operation.

02:41.563 --> 02:43.622
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

02:43.698 --> 02:46.189
Messner?
Listen. Hold it. l need
to speak with Locke.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.256
Get him on the phone.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.235
lf the situation's changed,
l need to hear it from him.

02:49.304 --> 02:50.794
You Messner?
Yeah. Who's this?

02:50.872 --> 02:53.204
Take a look at that.
Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.366
Used to be
with the PD down there.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.239
Agent Messner,
we recovered the car.

02:56.311 --> 02:59.974
What car?
Dupree's car. '89
Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

03:00.048 --> 03:03.176
Where did you find it?
Parking structure
at the Nomad.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.390
Are the overheads necessary?

03:20.468 --> 03:22.732
Turn the overheads off! Now!

03:22.804 --> 03:25.295
Not exactly low profile,
is this?
No, sir.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.635
Hotel locked down at all?

03:26.708 --> 03:28.903
l couldn't tell you that
right now, sir.

03:28.977 --> 03:31.468
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

03:32.113 --> 03:36.982
What, you stuck on stupid
or something? l know. You rode
a little bus to school.

03:37.518 --> 03:41.579
Hey, man, stop using
that fucking lotion, man.
You look like a damn Muppet.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.258
And don't let your bitch
cut your hair no more, dawg.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.294
lt look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

03:47.362 --> 03:50.525
Hey, but you need to bring
your ass down here and
help me out, Hugo, for real.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.725
l ain't cleaning all this
shit up myself, man.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.598
l'm tired.
l ain't no fucking
cleaning lady, dawg.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.298
For real. Bring your ass
down here. Shit.

03:58.373 --> 03:59.362
(SHOT FlRED)

03:59.941 --> 04:01.533
(GASPlNG)

04:10.518 --> 04:11.507
What the fuck?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.913
Hell, no.
You didn't do that, dawg.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.961
What'd you say to Mecklen?

04:24.732 --> 04:28.395
What l've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

04:29.137 --> 04:30.365
You see,

04:31.172 --> 04:34.835
this is one of them
rare moments where
your ass get a chance

04:34.909 --> 04:36.069
to be completely honest.

04:38.479 --> 04:42.540
lf l'm asking you what
you said to Mecklen,
assume the shit is rhetorical.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.043
Assume l already know.

04:46.821 --> 04:48.618
What do you see right now?

04:49.624 --> 04:52.787
You see exactly and only

04:53.661 --> 04:58.598
what l choose to show you.
That is illusion, lvy.

04:58.766 --> 05:03.567
That is the lie that
l tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

05:03.638 --> 05:08.041
in the moment,
in that split second,

05:08.276 --> 05:12.110
but seeing behind
this motherfucker and knowing

05:15.016 --> 05:17.814
that it's all bullshit.
Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

05:17.885 --> 05:22.083
But l can shape it, l can
shift it, l can make it
as real as this room.

05:22.156 --> 05:26.183
That's why l'm valuable here,
lvy. And that is why
you are not.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.285
l ain't valuable?
l am sorry.

05:28.362 --> 05:31.763
l love you. l never
wanted it to be like this.
You know that.

05:31.833 --> 05:35.860
lt don't matter
what you wanted.
lt's what you did.

05:36.938 --> 05:39.907
lf you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

05:41.809 --> 05:44.403
wait tiII you see
what I'm about to do here.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.001
l don't believe this.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.305
Battery's completely dead.

06:24.485 --> 06:28.444
Forget it. You won't get
a signal in here.
You'll have to wait.

06:28.990 --> 06:32.221
What about that line?
Can't you contact
your people with that?

06:32.293 --> 06:34.921
No, these phones
are hardwired directly
to maintenance,

06:34.996 --> 06:37.260
but once we reach
the penthouse,
l can call down.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.856
l'll have the elevators
taken offline, sir.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.463
LOCKE.: PasquaIe Acosta.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.805
BIood-money mercenary.
El Estrago.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.008
The PIague.

06:51.746 --> 06:54.306
When he was caught
by the SAS in BeIfast.

06:54.382 --> 06:57.476
And in prison, he chewed off
his fingertips to the bone.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.248
Why don't you
have maintenance do it?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.755
Do what, sir?
Shut the elevator down.

07:08.830 --> 07:12.197
An emergency shutdown
of our entire elevated
lift system, sir?

07:12.266 --> 07:14.291
No. That has to be
handled by my staff, sir.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.376
How long have you
been working here?

07:30.484 --> 07:31.815
Bill?

07:35.056 --> 07:38.719
MAN.: Oh, my God, I need
an ambuIance for BiII!
I'm in the security room.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.740
Are you anywhere
near the penthouse?
No, no.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.403
But that definitely
sounds like gunshots,

07:58.479 --> 07:59.810
and l don't know
where it's coming from.

07:59.881 --> 08:01.746
lt's your lFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

08:01.816 --> 08:03.147

get on the elevator
with the other agent.

What other agent?

15:27.261 --> 15:29.525

He said he was
from San Francisco.

He said he was here
to do some inspections.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.074
Then later, when l saw him
get on the elevator
with Carruthers...

15:48.148 --> 15:50.173
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.410
Yeah, l mean,
he had the badge
and everything.

15:51.485 --> 15:54.386

he was wearing one
of your security jackets.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.615

And that didn't
seem odd to you?

they gave it to him
so he could...

16:02.029 --> 16:03.257

32:21.374 --> 32:24.605
He's had a sustained
arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.304
l can't help him here.
We have to take him to...

32:26.379 --> 32:27.573
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get him up on the roof.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.309
Get Mr. lsrael up on the roof.
He's traveling back with us.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.146
l can't explain
everything right now.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.480
No, l...

32:33.953 --> 32:36.513
l need you to go back
to Washington.
What the hell happened here?

32:36.589 --> 32:38.955
l'm sorry, l cannot
disclose anything more
right now.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.083
So many people are dead.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.285
l need you to return
to Washington.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.761
You'll be debriefed
in the days to come.
Explain it now.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.821
Go back to Washington.

32:46.099 --> 32:47.225
There he goes!

32:47.300 --> 32:51.100
No, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

32:51.170 --> 32:54.833
He went this way! Please,
don't shoot me. Don't shoot!
Please! Don't shoot.

33:08.621 --> 33:12.113
FBl. You gotta
get up there! Got to go!

33:24.670 --> 33:26.331
Get these hotel guests out
in the hallway there.

33:26.406 --> 33:27.896
Just clear them down the hall.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.308
Make room. Make room, please.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.219
We'll have to go all the way
around to the other side.

33:46.259 --> 33:48.750
Clear the way here.
Clear the way.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.527
(GUN SHOT FlRED)

34:42.915 --> 34:43.904
Hey.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.516
That your car?
No, l...

34:53.226 --> 34:54.887
l'm confiscating it.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.119
FBl.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.596
Oh, you're FBl.
Yeah.

35:00.132 --> 35:03.295
Yes, l am. l would advise you
to lower your weapon, sir.

35:03.803 --> 35:06.636
You're investigating
those murders
out at the lake, huh?

35:06.772 --> 35:10.105
Say what?
Three men were
ambushed and shot.

35:10.176 --> 35:13.339
Two died and had
their bodies dumped
in the lake.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.013
The other has
severe hypothermia,

35:17.817 --> 35:21.913
possible dementia, and will
probably be a multiple
amputee by week's end.

35:21.988 --> 35:23.979
Shit, okay. You're right.

35:25.725 --> 35:27.056
l'm sorry.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.526
You shot me.
And you murdered my friends.

35:33.032 --> 35:35.023
Yeah, l know.

35:36.669 --> 35:39.433
And you dumped us
in the lake.
Pretty much.

35:39.672 --> 35:42.072
You were here hunting
the man named lsrael,
weren't you?

35:42.308 --> 35:45.709
ls that who
you was here for? lsrael?

35:47.346 --> 35:50.008
l guess we both got
beat out then, didn't we?

35:50.583 --> 35:51.914
Yeah, goddamn.

35:52.251 --> 35:56.244
Crazy motherfuckers
up there, huh? Gee whiz.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.718
Just give us your keys
and get the fuck out of here.

36:00.793 --> 36:01.782
Okay.

36:12.505 --> 36:15.167
l'm really sorry
about all that.

36:16.676 --> 36:19.110
Shit gets wild and crazy.

36:19.712 --> 36:23.580
Fate just up and fucks you
for no good reason.

36:24.150 --> 36:25.481
You know?

36:26.352 --> 36:28.320
lt's the way of the world!

36:28.721 --> 36:30.655
The way it's always gonna be.

36:32.992 --> 36:34.482
Okay, now.

36:35.561 --> 36:36.892
Peace, bro.

36:48.841 --> 36:50.331
Oh, fuck this.

37:59.578 --> 38:03.036
LOCKE: Suicide of some sort.
You know, troubles
with the law. Drugs.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.104
Deal with the patients.

38:04.183 --> 38:07.414
All right, Doctor, thank you.
You know, just make it
sound good.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.475
Okay.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.450
Where's lsrael?

38:13.926 --> 38:15.985
What are you doing here?
My debriefing.

38:16.062 --> 38:19.122
Your debriefing? Your
debriefing will be handled
in DC, like l told you.

38:19.198 --> 38:21.098
No, we need to
handle it now.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.032
You are instructed
to get out...

38:32.712 --> 38:34.475
What are you doing,
Agent Messner?

38:34.547 --> 38:36.378
Walk. Let's go.

38:37.850 --> 38:40.410
You're going to tell me
why no call was made

38:40.486 --> 38:43.182
to inform us
that the lsrael situation
had been altered.

38:43.255 --> 38:45.382
Why l and my friend
and partner,

38:45.458 --> 38:47.585
whose body
is going into
a furnace tomorrow,

38:47.660 --> 38:48.786
were never fucking contacted.

38:48.861 --> 38:51.694
l cannot discuss it.
You can and you will.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.357
You are finished.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.925
Look at my fucking face.
You just figure that out?

39:01.140 --> 39:04.439
Get that gun out of my spine
or engage the safety, please.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.141
Thank you.

39:18.157 --> 39:19.715
Make it make sense.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.718
They are father and son.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.764
IsraeI's mother was 19

39:27.833 --> 39:30.393
at the time when she
and Sparazza
had a brief affair

39:30.469 --> 39:32.596
of which IsraeI
was the byproduct.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.534
That same year, she brought
a paternity suit against him.

39:35.608 --> 39:37.200
Paternity suit?
Just for fun?

39:37.309 --> 39:39.573
Our surveillance
of Padiche, Serna...

39:39.645 --> 39:43.547
AII bogus and bad information
that set off a series
of unfortunate events.

39:43.616 --> 39:45.140
He's gonna cIip IsraeI.
Buddy lsrael.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.479
Buddy lsrael.

39:46.552 --> 39:47.644
Buddy lsrael.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.120
They got a guy. Some Swede.
Swede?

39:50.189 --> 39:52.851
Any word on this Swede?
...the mention of
this mysterious Swede.

39:52.925 --> 39:55.485
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.689
Dr. lngstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.129
SupposedIy a speciaIist.

40:00.199 --> 40:02.963
He's had a sustained
arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

40:03.035 --> 40:05.833
He's actually
the head of cardiology
at Stockholm University.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.372
Primo wants IsraeI's heart.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.339
Heart?
Mention of lsrael's heart?

40:09.408 --> 40:11.876
He's one of the
best heart surgeons
in the worId.

40:11.944 --> 40:14.412
The actuaI contract
went to LazIo Soot,

40:15.881 --> 40:18.008
the man who escaped
the penthouse yesterday...

40:18.250 --> 40:19.581
Don't shoot me!

40:19.885 --> 40:20.977
...in disguise.

40:21.053 --> 40:24.682
He was hired by Sparazza
to neutraIize
IsraeI's entourage.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.617
Dr. Ingstrom was here
to perform the surgery.

40:29.695 --> 40:33.688
And as father and son,
they are blood compatible.

40:42.408 --> 40:45.468
You're talking
about a transplant,
aren't you?

40:46.045 --> 40:47.876
You're talking about
a fucking heart transplant.

40:47.947 --> 40:50.916
You're gonna kill lsrael
to save Sparazza.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.380
No.

40:57.890 --> 41:00.450
Well, they dug it up
in archives as part of
the Sparazza investigation.

41:00.526 --> 41:03.290
That Sparazza
had major elective
plastic surgery?

41:03.362 --> 41:05.455
lt wasn't elective.
lt was undertaken
to save his life.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.520
Look at the work
he's had done.

41:06.599 --> 41:09.363
lt wasn't cosmetic.
lt was reconstructive.

41:09.702 --> 41:11.897
Look at the date
of the first procedure.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.996
Fifteen separate procedures
since 1952.

41:14.073 --> 41:17.668
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered
Freeman Heller.

41:17.743 --> 41:21.679
l'd like to show you
exactly what l meant
when l said, ''Change my face.''

41:22.081 --> 41:25.209
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

41:25.284 --> 41:27.047
l will have my ears
pinned back.

41:27.353 --> 41:31.790
Removing a slight piece
of bone in my chin
l will alter my jaw line.

41:31.857 --> 41:35.588
A procedure known
as rhinoplasty will reduce
the size of my nose.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.954
lf you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

41:38.030 --> 41:40.590
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.764
and more importantly,
nothing like
a federal agent's.

41:43.836 --> 41:45.770
Oh, Christ.
I wiII maintain a sIight Iimp.

41:45.905 --> 41:48.339
My accent wiII be
a regionaI CaIabrese.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.804
My birthplace, Cosenza, ltaly.

41:50.910 --> 41:52.036
That's him.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.269
And my name...

41:53.345 --> 41:55.836
That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

41:57.216 --> 41:59.980
Now, gentlemen,
l understand that this is
a dramatic approach.

42:00.052 --> 42:03.078
He went deep cover in 1940.
He couId have ripped
the Mafia apart.

42:03.155 --> 42:04.213
But l firmly believe...

42:04.290 --> 42:06.588
Dismantled most of
the organized crime

42:06.659 --> 42:10.117
...this is the only way
to truly infiltrate
organized crime.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.631
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

42:13.699 --> 42:15.030
swapped allegiances,

42:15.100 --> 42:17.227
so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.

42:17.303 --> 42:20.966
AII this time, we were toId
that it was Sparazza
that kiIIed HeIIer,

42:21.206 --> 42:24.198
when it was us, the FBI.

42:27.379 --> 42:29.040
And we didn't kiII him.

42:30.783 --> 42:34.048
He survived.
But the injuries he sustained

42:34.119 --> 42:37.520
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

42:37.623 --> 42:42.356
So he assumed
the identity of his alter ego.

42:43.362 --> 42:46.422
The figment of Primo Sparazza
became fIesh and bIood,

42:46.498 --> 42:49.399
and Freeman HeIIer
was no more.

42:52.137 --> 42:55.834
Now, the brass wanted
Heller's op removed
from official records,

42:55.908 --> 42:58.468
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

42:58.711 --> 43:01.339
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

43:01.413 --> 43:03.643
so history defaulted to fable.

43:03.716 --> 43:07.243
Until now.
Heller's op predated
the second World War.

43:07.319 --> 43:09.219
About 60 years
of amassed intel.

43:09.288 --> 43:11.848
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

43:11.924 --> 43:13.016
Yeah.

43:14.994 --> 43:16.393
So you made another deal,
didn't you?

43:16.462 --> 43:18.555
lsrael's deal
with the government
was tossed out.

43:18.630 --> 43:22.566
We are now trying to
rehabilitate him, so we
can attempt a transplant.

43:22.634 --> 43:25.228
You realize that
you're doing this
to save Sparazza?

43:25.304 --> 43:28.068
No, son. l'm doing all this
to save Heller.

43:28.140 --> 43:30.335
So you send us in there,
bugles blaring,

43:30.409 --> 43:33.139
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

43:33.746 --> 43:35.407
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

43:35.481 --> 43:39.941
Oh, shitcan
the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

43:40.019 --> 43:44.922
You withheld information
while Carruthers lay dying
in vain and in the dark.

43:44.990 --> 43:48.482
And your reasons
for doing that
are exactly what?

43:50.662 --> 43:51.822
That?

43:53.632 --> 43:55.600
Some mob fossil?

43:56.368 --> 43:58.700
A monster that
the Bureau built?

43:58.771 --> 44:01.831
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

44:01.907 --> 44:04.239
that's going to
blow the lid off
the last 60 years?

44:04.309 --> 44:05.333
Possibly.

44:05.411 --> 44:07.811
ls he gonna
show you where all
the bodies are buried?

44:07.880 --> 44:12.681
Or is his ultimate worth
bullshit?

44:12.751 --> 44:14.776
Utterly useless?

44:14.853 --> 44:17.947
That's a risk we take.
Yeah, empty pockets.

44:18.023 --> 44:21.515
Empty pockets paid for
by the lives of
our own people.

44:21.593 --> 44:22.855
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

44:22.928 --> 44:24.395
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

44:24.463 --> 44:26.522
My guy is dead.
You're starting
to piss me off.

44:26.598 --> 44:28.498
The Bureau betrayed us.

44:28.567 --> 44:30.125
Wake up.
You betrayed us...

44:30.202 --> 44:31.464
Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

44:31.537 --> 44:32.970
Get that thing out of my face.

44:33.038 --> 44:34.528
You betrayed us
the way you
betrayed them.

44:34.606 --> 44:35.595
You fucking asshole!

44:39.311 --> 44:42.576
Okay, if you like,
l'll take your verbal
resignation right here,

44:42.648 --> 44:43.637
right now.

44:43.849 --> 44:47.285
Do you want your career
to end here, now, like this?

44:47.953 --> 44:49.113
Your call.

44:49.188 --> 44:52.248
Now, l'm prepared to dismiss
your behavior. And in light
of what's happened,

44:52.324 --> 44:54.690
l understand it.
l really do,
and l'm truly sorry.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.284
But a decision
has been made.

44:56.361 --> 44:59.728
And we're required to abide
by it, regardless of
our personal feelings.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.665
Feelings that might
run contrary
to the collective good.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.066
And that, l need you
to understand.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.970
lt's time for you
to get on a jet back to DC

45:08.040 --> 45:10.702
and make no further
inquiry into this matter.

45:10.776 --> 45:13.040
ls that understood,
Agent Messner?

45:15.314 --> 45:18.112
Are we clear, Agent Messner?

45:23.322 --> 45:24.812
We're clear.

45:29.228 --> 45:30.525
We're clear.
