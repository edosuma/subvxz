02:32.195 --> 02:33.631
I'm dying in here.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.113
This tastes like shit!

02:39.333 --> 02:41.987
As if metastatic cancer
isn't torture enough.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.685
What is it, Judy?

02:43.728 --> 02:46.817
Camel milk.
Strengthens the immune system.

02:47.645 --> 02:50.648
Not sure how it tastes
so disgusting.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.172
It must be healthy.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.174
..erm, use the oven,
not the microwave...

02:56.959 --> 02:58.700
Good morning, Ms Roth.
I'm Emilia.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.528
I'll be taking care
of you today.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.399
Please, let's go through.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.010
In here? No, I can't
go in there.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.969
I need privacy, you see?

03:07.012 --> 03:10.494
Don't worry, every
infusion station
has curtains to ensure
just that.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.890
Oh, no, seriously,

03:14.933 --> 03:16.978
I... I need a room of my own.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.156
- There are no private rooms.
- I can wait.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.942
I'm sorry, Ms Roth, but we don't
have private rooms at all.

03:24.813 --> 03:28.773
Dr Fletcher personally
arranged for
me to come to this
remote location.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.906
He seemed to understand

03:30.949 --> 03:33.430
the importance
of maintaining my privacy.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.085
Could you get him, please?

03:36.128 --> 03:38.870
I'm afraid Dr Fletcher's
at his London hospital today.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.742
Jesus Christ!

03:40.785 --> 03:43.788
I understand coming here for the
first time is extremely
difficult.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.661
Dr Fletcher left specific
instructions for your care,

03:46.704 --> 03:49.185
and you're in very good hands
with Dr Hanson.

03:49.228 --> 03:52.579
Now, if you'll allow me,
I'd love to help
get you started.

Who?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.045
Bloody hell!
What would she be doing here?

04:23.088 --> 04:24.655
I read she was doing
a West End play

04:24.699 --> 04:26.440
that opened and closed
the same week.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.659

04:31.836 --> 04:33.751
MIKEY [WHISPERS]: She used to be
fucking huge.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.493
Ladies, please, let's have
some privacy here, shall we?

04:36.537 --> 04:37.538

04:37.581 --> 04:39.017
It isher!

04:42.499 --> 04:43.587
EMILIA: Don't worry.

04:44.675 --> 04:45.937
I'll speak to them.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.417
They won't talk.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.377
This is a fucking disaster.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.816
Once I'm done,
whomever you're here with

04:54.859 --> 04:57.034
- can come sit with you.
- It's just me.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.038
- You're here by yourself?
- Yes.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.866
But someone will need
to take you home.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.478
You're gonna be getting
some very strong drugs today.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.306
It's OK, I'll call a cab.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.568
You haven't told anyone?

05:09.526 --> 05:12.312
Can we start, please?
I'd like to get this over with.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.880
Ms Roth, chemotherapy's
not something

05:15.924 --> 05:17.969
that you can just get over with.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.581
- Your family will notice--
- Look, I appreciate it.

05:22.582 --> 05:26.151
I really do. Can
we just do this?

05:26.195 --> 05:29.067
Of course. Can you roll
your sleeve up for me, please?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.330
Thank you.

05:38.686 --> 05:39.730
Oh.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.387
OK.

05:55.224 --> 05:59.620
OK, we'll start you off
with some ondansetron for nausea

05:59.663 --> 06:01.317
and omeprazole for heartburn,

06:01.361 --> 06:03.275
before we move on
to the actual treatment,

06:03.319 --> 06:05.582
oxaliplatin and 9-FU.

06:05.626 --> 06:09.194
Here's some more ondansetron
for home
if you're still nauseated later.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.980
Now, ondansetron
might cause headaches,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.504
so here's paracetamol,
which might cause weakness,

06:14.548 --> 06:17.072
so here's dexamethasone,
which might cause insomnia,

06:17.115 --> 06:18.552
so here's some diazepam.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.554
Diazepam might make
you constipated,

06:20.597 --> 06:22.686
so be sure to take
the bisacodyl.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.602
In cases of severe diarrhoea
caused by the bisacodyl,

06:25.646 --> 06:27.430
here's some sicodium,

06:27.474 --> 06:30.868
and cortisol for haemorrhoids
caused by the diarrhoea.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.350
Hair might start to grow
where it's not supposed to,

06:34.394 --> 06:37.919
like a beard or a moustache,
but it goes away eventually.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.355
Oh, I'd just like to stress,

06:39.399 --> 06:42.402
there's no restriction
regarding sexual activity.

06:42.445 --> 06:46.101
Great! Now I just need to find
someone who's into
bearded ladies.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.976
OK. We're gonna go for
a slow drip here--

06:52.020 --> 06:54.849
Can, erm... can we take a break?

06:54.892 --> 06:56.284
Of course.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.156
I'll check in on you later.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.159
If you need anything,
be sure to buzz this
button here.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.605
You ladies behave.
Do you hear me?

07:12.997 --> 07:15.304
What did Annie put
in your lunch box
today, Mikey?

07:16.697 --> 07:17.698
Erm...

07:19.003 --> 07:21.223
..cucumber sandwiches
and carrot sticks.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.705
Oh, and... a unicorn sticker.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.489
Judy, we're running
a little late...

07:27.577 --> 07:29.884
on your prescription.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.581
I'll drop it off
when it's ready.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.327
OK, you, out with it.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.155
Shut up. Leave me alone.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.159
What's up with your
hair, anyway?

07:45.813 --> 07:46.988
Oh, dammit.

07:48.119 --> 07:51.906
You know, the cat chews on it
in her sleep.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.908
She's ruined it.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.953
I think she thinks
it's her mother.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.520
Oh, fuck it.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.609
I'm getting a new one
today, anyway.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.045
Oh, that's better.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.527
I prefer going "Baldilocks",
to be honest.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.965
It's just, genuinely,
it upsets the cat.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.666
Eggheads of the world unite!

08:12.709 --> 08:14.232
Why aren't you picking up?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.800
How's your cold?

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
I don't really have a cold.

08:18.715 --> 08:22.066
I knew it.
I can always tell when
you're lying.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.285
I have colon cancer.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.245
And I'm in chemotherapy
right now.

08:28.332 --> 08:29.378
What?

08:31.162 --> 08:32.599
Those stomach aches...

08:34.818 --> 08:38.256
Last Wednesday,
when you met with the producers,

08:38.299 --> 08:40.432
I went to see Dr Fletcher,

08:40.476 --> 08:44.828
and he said that I could come to
this small clinic
outside of London

08:44.872 --> 08:46.308
to keep a low profile.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.789
And I didn't wanna worry you,

08:48.832 --> 08:51.531
but they put me in a room
with other people,

08:51.574 --> 08:54.098
so I need you to come now.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.713
- Nance!
- I'm on my way.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.019
Jesus, Jules!

09:03.281 --> 09:04.544
You didn't wanna worry me?

09:04.587 --> 09:06.720
- Me?
- Don't yell at me.

09:06.763 --> 09:07.938
I get it.

09:09.636 --> 09:13.291
I need you to get here.
People saw me.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.250
Just stay away from anyone.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.688
But I really need to pee.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.517
And... what, there...
there are no bathrooms there?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.954
There are, but they're
on the other side of the room,

09:23.998 --> 09:25.782
and I have to walk past
all these women.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.002
JUDY: Who can hear you
loud and clear!

09:28.045 --> 09:29.177
MIKEY GIGGLES

09:29.220 --> 09:32.267
Who can hear me loud and clear.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.182
What if they heard
everything I said?

09:34.225 --> 09:36.053
JUDY: They did!
MIKEY: Judy shh!

09:36.793 --> 09:40.014
Oh... my God!

09:40.057 --> 09:42.277
- Nance...
- OK, honey,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.627
look, take a big breath
and go pee.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.673
OK? I'll be there
as fast as I can.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.633

09:50.677 --> 09:51.678

10:02.036 --> 10:05.517
I am so sorry.
Before you had on your...

10:07.389 --> 10:09.043
I'm a jerk.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.566
Please forgive me.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.482
It's fine.
I'm so sorry we scared you.

10:13.525 --> 10:16.180
- We should've given
you a heads up.
- Don't worry about it.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.880
I'm er... Mikey, by the way.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.711
- Massive fan.
- Aww, Mikey!

10:24.754 --> 10:26.277
I really appreciate that.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.584
Fuck me! I can't believe
this is happening!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.281
Julia Roth!

10:30.325 --> 10:32.066
In the flesh, standing
right here.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.982
This is so cool!

10:35.025 --> 10:37.985
Not that you being here
is... is... is cool.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.943
Of course. Erm...

10:39.987 --> 10:43.991
Mikey, if you don't shut up,
her bladder's going to explode.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.950
No, no, no, it's fine.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.911
I really appreciate it, Mikey.
It's just so sweet.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.347
But I need to, erm...

10:52.390 --> 10:53.740
Go for a whizz.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.272
SIGH OF RELIEF

11:06.013 --> 11:07.667
Oh, for goodness...

11:07.710 --> 11:10.539
Why are you getting so worked up
over an old Hollywood has-been?

11:10.582 --> 11:12.672
Julia Roth is not a has-been.

11:12.715 --> 11:15.022
MIKEY: She did that
film a few years
ago, remember?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.633
The one with what's-his-face,
the one in space.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.809
JUDY: That was terrible.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.681
MIKEY: Yeah. Yeah,
it fucking was.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.861
IMAAN: She has such
beautiful hair.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.297
MIKEY: Always has had.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.647
JUDY: Soon she's gonna look
like the rest of us.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.823
MIKEY: Julia Roth
is never gonna look like us.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.999
JUDY: Oh, yes.
MIKEY: Never gonna look like us.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.089

11:46.923 --> 11:49.970
Look, I am...
really sorry about before.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.058
Ugh.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.235
Ugh.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.368

we're not gonna
tell anyone about
you being here.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.544

12:01.764 --> 12:03.723
What's wrong with her?

12:03.766 --> 12:06.334
Oh, er, chemo can be
a bit tough at times.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.205
A bit?

12:08.249 --> 12:12.601
Judy, can Julia come with us?
Please? Please, please,
please...

12:12.644 --> 12:15.778
Oh, I can't leave.
I'm waiting for my manager.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.693
Oh, we're not going anywhere.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.391
Well, we are, but we're
not leaving.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.176
You'll see. Just give
me your hand.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.441
Don't mind me
while I'm suffering here.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.660
It's OK,
I promise. It's gonna be fun.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.838
Oh, God, so soft.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.188
Oh! Nice tattoo.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.016
- Mikey, shut up.
- Sorry.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.845
OK, here we go. Er,
close your eyes.

12:53.685 --> 12:57.385
We're on a beautiful island

12:57.428 --> 12:59.866
in the middle of a rainforest.

13:02.085 --> 13:06.916
There's a light wind.
A tender wind blowing.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.526
I can feel it. So nice!

13:08.570 --> 13:10.093
Shh! Mikey!

13:11.094 --> 13:14.532
JUDY: Just listen to the animals
in the distance.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.669
Now...

13:21.539 --> 13:23.803
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.630
Judy, wait. We've lost Julia.

You must think we're crazy.

I'm just... wondering
what's in your IV pack.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.556
I wish!

13:38.600 --> 13:41.124
No, it's just a little
thing we do
to take our minds off the pain.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.387
But it works.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.216
It's like a game, like
make-believe,
like pretending.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.827
Like acting.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.393
Shh, Judy.

13:49.959 --> 13:54.746
- So sorry. She's
in a lot of pain.
- OK, we will be there
soon enough.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.273
OK...

14:01.188 --> 14:04.191
We take a deep breath in.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.932

14:09.109 --> 14:11.938
Let every muscle in
your body relax,

14:11.981 --> 14:14.549
from your eyebrows to your toes.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.162
OK. We're back on the island.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.948
There's no beeping of monitors.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.515
No hissing of fluorescent
lights.

14:24.559 --> 14:28.128
No dreadful moaning.
It's all gone...

14:29.042 --> 14:31.696
far, far away.

14:32.393 --> 14:36.745
All you can hear is
the sound of waterfalls...

14:37.615 --> 14:40.096
and animals in the
forest behind.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.837
PARROT SQUAWKING

14:41.881 --> 14:44.274
WAVES BREAKING

14:51.325 --> 14:53.240
JUDY: Now, that's better.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.590
Welcome to Judy's holiday.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.679
Where the sun never shines,

14:57.722 --> 14:59.855
and where Judy bosses
us all around.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.859
Well, come on, ladies.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.296
Chop chop! We haven't
got all day.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.912
BIRDS CHIRPING

15:15.958 --> 15:17.394
Wait for me!

15:18.526 --> 15:19.875
MIKEY: Don't slip.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.884
No, thanks.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.192
JUDY: Quiet! You'll
scare it away.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.454
Scare what away?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.631
Look, here's the plan.
Mikey, you grab it.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.720
Imaan, you hold the knife.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.157
- Jesus!
- Don't worry.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.159
- We don't kill it.
- Kill what?

15:43.203 --> 15:45.945
And don't worry about
the poison.
That is what ignites
the healing.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.470
Poison? Can we go back now?

15:49.513 --> 15:52.038
Are you missing chemo already?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.909
What do you think's
in that IV bag? Tea?

15:55.215 --> 15:57.173
MIKEY: OK, meanie.

15:57.217 --> 16:00.002
You tell me right now
what is bothering you today.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.700
IMAAN: Hey, maybe we should
just give her some space.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.746
JUDY: Chop chop!
Let's get on with it.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.791
This is how you relax
from chemo?

16:07.662 --> 16:09.185
You don't know Judy.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.578
You don't know chemo!

16:14.103 --> 16:15.757
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

16:17.715 --> 16:19.369
Hi. Hello.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.589
- Hey. Where's the blue dummy?
- What, you can't find it?

16:21.632 --> 16:24.244
I've looked everywhere.
He won't take anything else.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.811
Maybe try the, er...
you know the third drawer...

16:26.855 --> 16:29.640
- Yeah, wait, wait,
don't hang up.
- Yeah, go look. I'll wait.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.468
I swear to God...

16:31.512 --> 16:34.776
It's an old tribal ritual.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.866
You apply the frog's venom
into an open wound,

16:37.909 --> 16:40.869
and it makes the body
so sick that it...

16:40.912 --> 16:42.566
purges the toxins.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.828
Mikey!

16:50.270 --> 16:51.836
FROG CROAKING

17:00.062 --> 17:02.499
First, you tell me
what's up with you today.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.590
Fine.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.159
Promise me you won't
get excited. OK?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.598
I had a CT scan this morning.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.558
My tumour might be shrinking.
I'm still waiting
for the results.

17:17.601 --> 17:18.776
SCREAMS

17:18.819 --> 17:21.257
Oh, my God! Judy, that's
so exciting!

17:21.300 --> 17:22.998
Mikey, dammit!

17:23.520 --> 17:26.435
Oh, shit! Sorry.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.787
OK, call me if you find it.
Yes, I'm so sorry.

17:29.831 --> 17:33.487
Abed can't find that blue dummy
and the baby won't fall asleep--

17:33.530 --> 17:35.228
Jesus Christ!

17:37.012 --> 17:40.450
Could we, once, just once,

17:40.494 --> 17:44.193
focus on catching
that bloody frog?

17:44.759 --> 17:46.804
This is my holiday.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.720
And it's gone.

17:50.634 --> 17:51.809
Again.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.724
JULIA CLEARS THROAT

17:57.641 --> 17:58.816
Don't move.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.037
Imaan.

18:02.777 --> 18:03.952
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

18:03.995 --> 18:05.040
Ladies?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.522
Coming through!

18:09.175 --> 18:10.872
- Joey!
- The one and only.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.396
- Did you get it?
- Oh, yeah. I've got
it right here.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.051
Oh, I think I am in
actual love with you.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.661
Barking up the wrong tree, dear.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.624
Julia? Julia Roth?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.105
No, you're confused.

18:26.714 --> 18:30.109
Oh, come on, I'd recognise
that beautiful hair anywhere.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.546
It's Joey. I did your hair
on that Jane Austen movie.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.113
It was years ago.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.724
Right. That's right.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.597
What are you doing here?

18:41.381 --> 18:43.861
- Oh, no. No.
- No. Research.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.080
For a new role.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.562
Wait, what's in your IV?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.001
- Vitamins.
- Vitamins?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.134
Vitamins.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.962
Oh, phew!

18:58.615 --> 19:00.704
Thank God! I nearly
wet my knickers.

19:00.748 --> 19:04.230
I thought, "Oh, no, no, please!
Not Julia Roth! No!"

19:04.839 --> 19:06.014
What a relief.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.060
Isn't it?

19:09.104 --> 19:13.021
Well, let's get you
into character
right away.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.241
Oh.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.199
No, Joey,
I'm not sure that's such a...

19:17.243 --> 19:18.505
- Is it?
- No!

19:19.114 --> 19:20.985
Yeah, let's do it.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.946
I gave up the film business
years ago.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.950
I got tired of waiting
for the gigs,
surviving the dry months.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.865
But here it's always pouring.

19:30.908 --> 19:34.651
I mean, this job is so dynamic.
The customer turnover
is amazing.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.177
Hold still.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.834
I could swear you were dying.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.362
What the hell?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.713
Jules... what have
they done to you?

19:54.367 --> 19:58.371
- Relax, Nance.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

19:58.936 --> 20:00.503
You think that's funny?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.726
OK, er... meet and
greet is over.
Everyone back off.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.032
MOBILE PHONE RINGING

20:08.076 --> 20:09.251
Hey. Found it?

20:09.295 --> 20:11.035
No. It's quite the drama.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.951
Yeah, there's his mobile
with, like, dolphins.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.214
- Yeah...
- Out of battery.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.390
- Oh. OK...
- You.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.392
Who are you talking to?

20:19.435 --> 20:21.568
- Keep your hair on, missus!
- Hello?

20:21.611 --> 20:23.178
- No-one cares.
- Hello?

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
OK, bye.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.097
IMAAN: Yeah, so get that one.
That puts him to sleep...

20:29.140 --> 20:33.319
Now... who else knows? The kids?

20:33.362 --> 20:35.234
Oh, God, no. And you
can't tell them.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.496
What...?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.498
You're supposed
to FaceTime Cassie later.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.804
She wanted to see your dress
at the fitting today.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.850
Oh, God! No, the fitting...

20:42.893 --> 20:44.286
Shit, Nance!

20:46.549 --> 20:48.943
Cass can't know about this
before the wedding.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.814
I'm not gonna tell Nate either.

20:50.858 --> 20:54.035
Just tell her I don't feel well.
No, don't do that.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.037
Tell her I have to work, or--

20:56.080 --> 20:58.257
Jules... relax.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.780
I'll deal with Cassie.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.568
So...

21:06.352 --> 21:09.746
I did some research,
and once we get back to the US,

21:09.790 --> 21:12.836
there's a doctor you have to see
in New Mexico

21:12.880 --> 21:14.142
who's also a shaman.

21:14.185 --> 21:17.232
She developed this, erm,
herbal therapy.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.887
It supposedly crushes
cancer cells.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.671
Something with turmeric--

21:21.715 --> 21:24.195
JUDY: It's sage, actually.
MIKEY: It's not sage,
it's thyme.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.422
NANCE: Can't believe they didn't
let you have your own room.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.163
That's what I need
you to fix, Nance.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.993
And no New Mexico shaman.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.995
You know I can't stand turmeric.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.998
It might be sage.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.087
And I'm not gonna go back to LA.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.090
What, so they can high-five
Julia Roth

21:49.133 --> 21:50.831
for having her West
End play killed

21:50.874 --> 21:53.877
and getting colon cancer
in the same week? No.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.141
I'm gonna stay here,
away from the press
and everyone,

21:58.055 --> 22:00.536
and then, when this
is all over...

22:00.580 --> 22:03.583
I'll fly back to LA
in time for the wedding.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.933
Screw that piece-of-shit
West End production.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.282
Good riddance.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.719
Now you'll have time
to prep for the pilot.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.982
What pilot? Hello?

22:13.201 --> 22:16.596
Well, you... you mean they won't
hire you cos you have cancer?

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
- Right.
- Wrong.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.904
They could never not hire you
cos you have cancer.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.515
That would make them...

22:23.211 --> 22:26.475
What's that word for racist
against cancer?

22:26.519 --> 22:28.521
- Cancerist.
- Cancerist?

22:28.564 --> 22:30.523
And no-one wants to look like
a cancerist.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.481
No-one knows what
a cancerist is.

22:32.525 --> 22:35.397
And no, you're not gonna tell
the network.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.268
Not the network.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.142
The world.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.666
- What are you talking about?
- You wanted me to fix this.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.669
Not only are we not
gonna hide it,
we... No, you...

22:46.713 --> 22:49.585
will be sharing your journey
with the public.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.066
You'll be the face of cancer.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.764
Providing hope
and inspiring millions
of patients

22:54.808 --> 22:57.376
across America and
around the world--

22:57.419 --> 22:58.986
The face of cancer?

22:59.029 --> 23:02.206
I'm talking about
your long-overdue memoirs,

23:02.250 --> 23:06.036
with a new ending chapter titled
"How I Beat Cancer".

23:06.080 --> 23:09.126
You're talking about
using my cancer
as a comeback?

23:10.650 --> 23:11.912
Am I that desperate?

23:13.479 --> 23:16.656
God... No, no, Nance.

23:16.699 --> 23:20.399
I told you not to say comeback.
You never left.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.401
And we'll wait till after
the wedding.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.838
Of all the crazy ideas...

23:24.881 --> 23:27.231
Thank me next year
in your Emmy acceptance speech.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.496
Well... first I have
to get the part.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.323
Oh, gimme a break!

23:33.237 --> 23:35.979
Sharon told me the reading
was just a formality,

23:36.023 --> 23:38.417
the Kate part is practically
yours.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.419
You mean Lauren.
Kate's the neighbour.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.159
She's only in one scene.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.207
You are fucking kidding me.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.166
Those fucking assholes!

23:49.210 --> 23:51.212
Jules, I'll fix this.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.300
I promise.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.043
Either way, they're asking you
to dye your hair.

23:56.913 --> 24:00.787
Well... next month,
there'll be no hair to dye.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.664
Excuse me? Some privacy, please?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.711
Ms Roth,
today's entrée is now served,

24:11.754 --> 24:13.364
oxaliplatin.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.281
Also, it's time for
doctor's rounds.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.935
Dr Handsome, too?

24:18.979 --> 24:21.198
Yes, Mikey, Dr Hanson, too!

24:21.895 --> 24:23.679
How is this silly
joke still alive?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.029
Chemotherapy.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.031
Who's Dr Hanson?

24:28.075 --> 24:30.077
Oh, he's a star.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.775
Captain Chemo! Smexy as hell.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.343
He's our very own Julia Roth.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.693
There's only one Julia Roth!

24:37.737 --> 24:39.956
And I'm gonna get
her her own room!

24:41.654 --> 24:44.439
Actually, when I'm done,
you'll have your own
goddamn wing.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.008
Thank God you're here, Nance.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.620
I got this, Jules.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.637
Face of cancer, seriously?

25:08.681 --> 25:10.639
MIKEY: I'm picking up
some very good vibes.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.641
JUDY: What on earth
are you talking about?

25:12.685 --> 25:14.208
Good morning. How is everyone?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.079
- Cool.
- Shit.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.908
- I'm fine.
- Oh, good. Sounds like usual.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.476
I hope they're not
distracting you
from your studies?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.739
No, they're not,
but my chemo brain is.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.394
Wait, Doc?

25:26.437 --> 25:28.744
What about Judy's results?

25:28.788 --> 25:30.572
Ah, yes, we're still
waiting on that.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.705
And that is completely OK,

25:32.748 --> 25:35.490
because we already know
that they are good.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.190
Dr Hanson, have you met
your colleague, Dr Good Vibes?

25:40.234 --> 25:43.106
Professor Good Vibes, please.
Enchantée.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.761
That's a really nice wig,
Professor Good Vibes.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.068
Thanks, Doc!

25:54.465 --> 25:57.425
- Good morning, Ms Roth.
- I've had better.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.645
I can imagine.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.995
We'll try to make this
as comfortable as possible,

26:02.038 --> 26:03.518
under the circumstances.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.607
- Now, Dr--
- I've also had worse.

26:06.477 --> 26:07.609
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.090
Never mind.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.312
Julia Catherine Roth,
58 years old--

26:18.315 --> 26:20.796
Well, you know,
the secret to staying young...

26:21.667 --> 26:24.495
- live honestly, eat
slowly and...
- Lie about your age.

26:24.539 --> 26:25.758
Lucille Ball.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.327
Never mind. Erm...

26:31.198 --> 26:32.852
can we continue, please?

26:34.593 --> 26:37.117
Colonoscopy and PET/CT shows

26:37.160 --> 26:39.815
- stage 4 metastatic
colon cancer--
JUDY: Jesus!

26:39.859 --> 26:41.164
MIKEY: Oh, fuck!

26:42.252 --> 26:45.952
Adenocarcinoma
originating from the colon,

26:45.995 --> 26:48.650
with multiple metastases
in liver and lung.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.174
Receiving neoadjuvant therapy.

26:51.784 --> 26:54.787
- May I say something?
- Yes, Ms Roth.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.573
I need you all to keep
my being here
today to yourselves.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.577
Right. Well, rest assured
that we will, Ms Roth.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.100
Dr Blake.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.712
Candidate for right
hemicolectomy,
left hepatectomy

27:06.755 --> 27:10.063
and radiofrequency ablation
of lung metastases.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.282
First-line therapy ideas?

27:12.326 --> 27:13.849
- We have--
- Excuse me.

27:15.329 --> 27:19.289
My manager has non-disclosure
agreements for you all to sign.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.640
You too, Dr Handsome.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.512
Hanson.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.645
Dr Hanson.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.256
CLEARS THROAT

27:29.299 --> 27:30.561
Ms Roth, erm...

27:33.216 --> 27:35.305
I'm not sure what
you're accustomed to,

27:35.349 --> 27:38.134
but here, we doctors
are discreet
about all of our patients.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.660
Regardless of who they are
or what we sign.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.663
- Well, I just--
- Any questions about
your treatment?

27:45.576 --> 27:46.752
Yes.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.624
I need my own room.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.801
Well, Ms Roth,
I assure you, in this country,

27:52.845 --> 27:55.804
we deeply appreciate
the need of a room of one's own.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.677
But this is a public hospital

27:58.720 --> 28:00.504
and we are unable
to provide one.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.855
But what we are able
and very determined to provide

28:02.898 --> 28:05.205
is the best possible
medical care for you.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.294
Now, do let us know
if you have any...

28:07.337 --> 28:09.644
medical matters that you wish
to discuss with us.

28:11.515 --> 28:12.952
OK. Thank you.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.085
Moving on.

28:17.086 --> 28:18.435
DR HANSON: Ladies.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.181
INDISTINCT CHATTER

28:26.269 --> 28:27.706
DOOR CLOSES

28:30.752 --> 28:32.014
JULIA [SOBBING]: Oh, God.

28:32.058 --> 28:34.147
MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING

28:47.116 --> 28:49.249
JULIA: What a dick!

28:50.163 --> 28:51.860
Who does he think he is?

28:53.993 --> 28:55.995
I haven't cried since
last Wednesday,

28:56.038 --> 28:59.650
and now this smug, asshole,
piece-of-shit doctor...

29:00.782 --> 29:02.784
He's a very good doctor.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.699
Medical questions, my ass!

29:05.874 --> 29:07.876
Who could understand
a word they said?

29:08.921 --> 29:10.661
They do that on purpose.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.014
God, Nancy!

29:15.057 --> 29:16.755
Where the fuck are you?

29:16.798 --> 29:17.886
SOBBING

29:19.192 --> 29:21.237
Fuck! Fuck!

29:31.857 --> 29:34.729
- Hey.
- Hey, Abed, did he fall asleep?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.036
I've already tried everything.
He won't go down.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.473
Oh, no, I just... I just...

29:39.516 --> 29:41.518
found the dummy in
my pocket, so...

29:41.562 --> 29:44.043
- Thank God!
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.132
Erm, yeah, just come.
I'll give it to you.

29:48.308 --> 29:50.136
OK. Sorry.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.533
So how many stages are there?

29:58.579 --> 29:59.623
Er...

30:00.407 --> 30:01.451
What do you mean?

30:12.941 --> 30:16.423
When they said stage 4,
you all groaned.

30:17.163 --> 30:21.167
So, it's...
four out of how many, exactly?

30:23.430 --> 30:24.648
Well?

30:24.692 --> 30:27.608
Maybe you should
speak to Emilia.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.566
Didn't your doctor
give you the talk?

30:30.263 --> 30:31.525
He did.

30:32.526 --> 30:35.007
He told me I had cancer
and I fainted.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.837
And then I went back
to the hotel...

30:38.880 --> 30:41.274
turned off my phone and...

30:41.317 --> 30:43.102
self-medicated,

30:43.145 --> 30:46.496
with a month's supply
of antidepressants

30:46.540 --> 30:48.020
and a case of vodka.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.374
So... how many stages
are we talking about?

31:01.947 --> 31:04.079
Look, it's just numbers, OK?

31:05.646 --> 31:09.171
It's all about your spirit,
which can't be graded, right?

31:10.477 --> 31:13.262
Well... what are your numbers?

31:18.137 --> 31:20.791
- 3C.
- Oh, there's letters, too.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.925
Yes, I... I'm 3A.

31:23.969 --> 31:28.060
At least...
until my scan results come back.

31:28.843 --> 31:31.411
- 2B.
- Oh, I'm in the lead.

31:32.586 --> 31:35.328
All I get are supporting roles
these days.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.938
We love you, Julia.

31:38.505 --> 31:39.636
I appreciate that.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.687
So, erm...

31:48.732 --> 31:50.996
there's no stage 5, huh?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.348
Well, how do I know
if I'm 4A or 4D?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.004
There's only one four.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.093
I see.

32:03.225 --> 32:06.489
NANCE: Wow! Aren't
you one lucky gal!

32:06.533 --> 32:08.274
No private rooms, my ass!

32:08.317 --> 32:10.885
Tell that to your
new, beautiful, private room,

32:10.929 --> 32:13.148
thank you very much,
yeah, that's right.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.020
OK, Jules, let's get
you outta here.

32:15.063 --> 32:18.371
I got your bag, your jacket.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.416
Oh, I got you some tea.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.636
There's a lady outside
giving it away for free.

32:22.679 --> 32:26.466
Honestly! I don't get
the healthcare system here.

32:26.509 --> 32:27.902
[CHUCKLING] So bizarre.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.036
Let's go, Jules.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.521
Just got off the
phone with Hugh.

32:38.565 --> 32:41.742
I didn't say anything.
Just feeling the water.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.613
They'd love to have you on.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.268
Come. Come see your new suite.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.445
OK. Here we go.

32:49.489 --> 32:52.187
I talked to Sharon
at the network.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.581
The Kate part isn't small.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.757
It's a cameo.
They wrote it with you in mind.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.064
That's why it's the
funniest one.

32:59.107 --> 33:01.892
Hey. This is a nice room.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.460
Jules?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.465
I can't stay in this room.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.640
What? Why?

33:12.207 --> 33:13.469
It stinks.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.747
Seriously, I can't
smell anything.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.968
I don't know, maybe
it's the chemo.

33:34.795 --> 33:37.363
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

33:37.406 --> 33:40.583
I'll fix this.
I'll get new a new
room right away.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.150
Don't forget your tea.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.326
JUDY: No place for
fainters on this
front.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.721
IMAAN: You certainly
raise the bar
for being tough, Judy.

33:47.764 --> 33:50.680
Fuck a duck! Did you hear the
surgeries they've
got her down for?

33:50.724 --> 33:52.595
That's not surgery,
it's butchery.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.597
Well, she has stage 4.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.078
I mean,
there might not even be any...

33:57.122 --> 33:58.645
point in operating-- I know...

33:59.689 --> 34:03.041
Let's hope they find out
before they open her up.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.956
Yeah. I just hope she gets
through the day all right.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.003
DOOR CLOSES

34:32.025 --> 34:34.507
Listen, what we said,
it's really not that bad.

34:34.550 --> 34:38.989
Especially if you
believe in karma
and the power of the
mind to create.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.426
I don't.

34:42.906 --> 34:43.951
So...

34:44.821 --> 34:46.127
tell me about the butchery.

34:46.170 --> 34:49.217
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.784
It's just a few surgeries.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.483
I've had my uterus, ovaries,
fallopian tubes,

34:54.527 --> 34:56.964
spleen and gallbladder removed.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.749
My mouth's practically
connected to my arse.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.882
Which explains all the shit
coming out of it.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.059
Plenty more where
that came from,
darling.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.104
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

35:07.670 --> 35:10.456
I got us a new room.
Come smell it.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.937
Never mind. I don't need a room.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.897
Well, of course, you do.
We can't risk more
people seeing you.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.768
Nance, no-one cares.

35:18.812 --> 35:21.119
Oh, come on, Jules.
This is ridiculous.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.515
Well... whatever you want.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.213
BELL RINGING

35:28.256 --> 35:31.781
Oh! It's, erm...
It's Harriet's last
chemo session.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.349
MIKEY: Oh, it's today?
I'm gonna cry.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.830
DISTANT APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

35:36.873 --> 35:39.572
- Let's go. Come on, Julia.
- Come on.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.617
Erm, don't worry,
we'll keep our distance.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.495
MIKEY [VOCALISING]: Brrrrrrr!

35:49.538 --> 35:51.192
Harriet!

35:51.236 --> 35:52.541
JUDY: There she is.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.195
Harriet!

35:56.066 --> 35:58.112
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING

36:10.951 --> 36:12.996
SORROWFUL MUSIC PLAYING

36:20.221 --> 36:22.615
MIKEY: That's you
next week, Judy!

36:22.658 --> 36:24.356
OK, what are we all gonna wear?

36:24.399 --> 36:26.053
Don't jinx it!

36:26.096 --> 36:28.925
Of course,
I'd love to hear
that bell again.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.580
"Again"?

36:31.624 --> 36:33.321
Wait, you've been here before?

36:33.365 --> 36:35.410
Oh, yeah. Four times.

36:35.454 --> 36:38.108
- Me, too. Twice.
- Still working on my first.

36:39.806 --> 36:40.981
But you're both back?

36:42.374 --> 36:44.941
Yeah. And soon enough,
we'll be back there.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.901
- Ringin' that bell.
IMAAN: Inshallah. Can't wait.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.860
You know, Annie's already
picked out our matching outfits.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.427
JUDY: Of course, she has!

36:52.471 --> 36:53.820
LAUGHTER

37:09.531 --> 37:11.141
What's wrong, Jules?

37:12.534 --> 37:13.709
I got cancer.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.277
Funny girl, aren't you?

37:17.800 --> 37:20.325
I wanna call Cassie,
make sure she got my text.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.240
Wait, what time is it in LA?

37:23.284 --> 37:25.634
Nope. Still too early
for Cassie.

37:25.678 --> 37:26.766
Wait, you two a couple?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.377
- Aw, that's so lovely!
- No.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.423
Jules was married
to my brother years ago.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.773
And Nancy's my compensation
for that marriage.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.340
Strictly platonic.

37:35.383 --> 37:36.863
So why the tattoos?

37:37.385 --> 37:38.952
Oh, it's kinda silly.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.303
We got them for our
40th birthday.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.697
Well... my 40th.

37:44.740 --> 37:48.091
I was devastated,
and Nancy came up with this idea

37:48.135 --> 37:51.660
of tattooing a circle for each
decade to celebrate our growth.

37:51.704 --> 37:52.966
- Like trees.
- Like trees.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.795
BOTH CHUCKLE

37:55.838 --> 37:58.972
So... that's our 40th...

37:59.755 --> 38:01.409
and our 50th...

38:02.932 --> 38:05.326
and... still counting.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.290
Did I mention we were
really drunk?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.422
Well, I think it's beautiful.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.729
That's the network, folks.
I'll be right back.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.775
Oh, Nance, I don't wanna do it.
Please.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.386
Nancy Green. Just a second.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.866
Just starting a conversation.
That's all. No commitment.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.919
- Dr Ambrose?
- Yes. Hi, Ms Green.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.355
Thanks for calling me back.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.357
Look,
about your friend's situation...

38:36.401 --> 38:38.794
- Er, yes, it's sad.
- ..I'm not going to lie.

38:38.838 --> 38:41.580
We're talking a 7% chance
of recovery here, realistically.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.495
But you don't know her.
She's a fighter.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.845
- I'm sure she is--
- If anyone can land in...

38:48.021 --> 38:50.545
..that 7%, it's her.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.548
GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING

39:01.817 --> 39:02.862
JUDY: Ugh.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.785
Are you OK?

39:12.828 --> 39:13.960
It's just pain.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.529
We're old mates.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.358
Here we go.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.884
Judy hates that
I don't hate the pain.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.800
I just reckon it's there
for a reason, so...

39:28.757 --> 39:30.150
there's no point ignoring it.

39:30.193 --> 39:33.066
"Ignore it". I say kill it!

39:35.677 --> 39:36.722
Mikey?

39:38.201 --> 39:39.899
Do you want to go on holiday?

39:41.727 --> 39:43.206
- Hell, yeah.
- OK.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.034
Come on.

39:55.828 --> 39:56.872
Where are we?

40:06.012 --> 40:08.014
DANCE MUSIC PLAYING

40:16.805 --> 40:19.504
In the happiest place on earth.

40:19.547 --> 40:20.592
Not again!

40:20.635 --> 40:23.769
DANCE MUSIC GETS LOUDER

40:23.812 --> 40:27.250
PARTYGOERS CHEERING
AND CHATTERING

40:36.434 --> 40:38.261
Judy would whack me
for saying this,

40:38.305 --> 40:41.830
but if you choose to accept it,
cancer can be a gift.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.050
Does it come with
a gift receipt?

40:44.093 --> 40:45.268
I mean it.

40:46.966 --> 40:49.925
Well, it certainly helps you get
your life priorities straight.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.536
And then you die.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.451
No-one's dying!

40:55.801 --> 40:59.500
At some point, you're gonna have
to stop resisting

40:59.544 --> 41:00.849
and start accepting.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.373
What's so damn great
about accepting?

41:03.417 --> 41:07.682
Mikey? Mikey, I cannot keep on
coming on holiday with you.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.642
I've got other patients
to care for.

41:10.685 --> 41:12.252
I'm sorry, Doc.

41:12.295 --> 41:15.255
And also, I'm very concerned
about your drug consumption.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.522
Why is he a dick
even in your fantasy?

41:21.566 --> 41:22.915
I have man issues.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.265
Me, too.

41:25.308 --> 41:26.484
CHILD: Mum?

41:27.659 --> 41:28.703
Mum!

41:30.749 --> 41:31.793
Mum!

41:31.837 --> 41:33.360
Are you OK?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.318
Mum!

41:38.017 --> 41:39.627
- Mum!
- Annie!

41:42.717 --> 41:43.718
Mum!

41:45.851 --> 41:46.895
Annie!

41:48.201 --> 41:50.508
- Mum?
- Annie!

41:51.596 --> 41:53.249
- Annie!
- Mummy?

41:53.293 --> 41:55.991
- Annie! Annie!
- Mummy?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.298
- Annie!
- Mummy?

41:58.341 --> 42:00.126
- Annie!
- Mummy?

42:00.169 --> 42:01.301
Ali?

42:01.997 --> 42:02.998
Ali?

42:03.042 --> 42:05.044
ALI SHOUTING

42:06.524 --> 42:08.395
Hey. Sorry, I just...

42:08.438 --> 42:09.701
No, it's OK.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.704
Hey. So sorry Mummy
took your dummy.

42:12.747 --> 42:13.792
I'm so sorry.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.968
Silly Mummy. Hello, Ali.

42:17.839 --> 42:19.232
Sama...

42:19.275 --> 42:21.756
Oh, they called from school,
on our way here.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.845
She's a little feverish.

42:23.889 --> 42:27.022
And she knows she mustn't get
too close to Mummy
and her friends.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.373
It's OK,
she's been really
brave about it.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.245
- Like a real big girl.
- Hey.

42:33.638 --> 42:35.596
So sorry, my darling.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.555
It's not your fault, OK?

42:37.598 --> 42:39.121
It's Mummy's fault.

42:39.165 --> 42:41.428
It's no-one's fault.

42:41.471 --> 42:45.345
Sama, life sometimes gets
a little shitty, you know?

42:47.129 --> 42:50.742
Oh, erm... er, this
is Julia Roth.

42:50.785 --> 42:53.440
- You probably recognised her.
- No, I'm a new patient.

42:54.397 --> 42:56.269
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.967
I hope you get better soon,
sweetheart.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.579
- We should go.
- Yeah.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.885
- We'll come pick you up later.
- OK.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.279
Oh, no. No, let Sama rest.

43:06.322 --> 43:08.237
Annie and I will drop Imaan off.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.848
We're taking Judy, anyway.

43:09.891 --> 43:11.458
It's our chemobile.

43:13.112 --> 43:14.504
- Yeah, it's fine.
- OK.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.594
That'd be really
nice, thank you.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.508
Hey, listen to me.

43:18.552 --> 43:21.250
When you feel better,
weare going
to do something really nice.

43:21.294 --> 43:22.338
OK?

43:22.991 --> 43:24.253
Just you and me.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.474
I love you.

43:31.173 --> 43:32.174
OK.

43:32.218 --> 43:33.698
Yeah. OK.

43:46.145 --> 43:48.364
JUDY: It's just a little bit of
temperature.

43:48.408 --> 43:50.105
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

43:50.802 --> 43:51.803
Yeah.

43:52.934 --> 43:55.458
Yeah, but then the baby
will get it and...

43:56.329 --> 43:59.201
I'll have to stay
in bed for a week
so I don't get an infection.

43:59.245 --> 44:00.638
There's my Bar exam.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.250
Abed will have to
take care of them
all by himself.

44:06.034 --> 44:08.733
And by the time
everyone's healthy
again, I'll...

44:08.776 --> 44:11.257
I'll forget that I promised Sama
our one-on-one time

44:11.300 --> 44:16.566
and she won't mention it because
she knows she needs
to be... brave.

44:16.610 --> 44:18.830
And to behave like a big girl.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.878
She's five.

44:30.842 --> 44:33.279
Sometimes life can
be really shitty.

44:45.770 --> 44:49.730
You feeling sick or...
acid reflux?

44:49.774 --> 44:51.210
It's awful.

44:51.950 --> 44:55.170
- Poor love.
- The awful hasn't
even started yet.

44:57.042 --> 45:01.220
Nurse Emilia gave
me something for
it but I don't know what it was.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.961
Doesn't matter.

45:03.004 --> 45:04.527
Couldn't help, anyway.

45:05.311 --> 45:07.269
[BURPS] Sorry.

45:09.054 --> 45:10.316
God!

45:11.186 --> 45:12.927
How do you guys do it?

45:12.971 --> 45:14.755
We go on our holidays.

45:16.888 --> 45:19.412
- Do you want to try?
- I don't know how.

45:19.455 --> 45:22.197
Oh, that's OK. We'll
show you how.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.204
Right, so where do
you want to go?

45:29.248 --> 45:31.250
Bet you know some dreamy places.

45:33.687 --> 45:35.341
JUDY: Now, don't overthink it.

45:36.255 --> 45:37.909
Hey. Close your eyes.

45:38.910 --> 45:39.911
OK.

45:41.913 --> 45:43.741
Relax all your muscles.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.267
Now take a big breath.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.708
You girls want to see dreamy?

45:54.752 --> 45:56.144
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING

45:56.188 --> 45:57.319
DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING

45:57.363 --> 45:58.843
MIKEY: Woo hoo! Bonjour!

45:58.886 --> 46:00.583
PAPARAZZI CLAMOURING

46:01.236 --> 46:02.760
Go, girl!

46:07.765 --> 46:08.766
Julia!

46:09.854 --> 46:11.246
Give us a smile, Julia!

46:11.943 --> 46:13.771
- You look gorgeous today!
- Julia!

46:14.554 --> 46:15.598
- Julia!
- Julia!

46:19.777 --> 46:22.301
- Julia.
- These holidays are
meant for you.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.433
Yeah, don't waste them
on impressing us.

46:24.477 --> 46:26.871
- Julia!
- Julia!

46:28.655 --> 46:30.613
BIRDS CHIRPING

46:33.051 --> 46:34.226
Oh.

46:34.269 --> 46:36.184
CELEBRANT: You may now
kiss the bride.

46:36.228 --> 46:38.621
SERENE MUSIC PLAYING

46:41.189 --> 46:45.541
- This is where I
really wanna be.
- Oh, Julia, this is
lovely. Really.

46:45.585 --> 46:46.934
Oh, she's gorgeous.

46:49.589 --> 46:52.548
I can't believe they started
without me.

46:55.073 --> 46:56.814
Oh, Cass!

46:57.510 --> 46:59.729
Cass! Sweetheart! Cass!

47:00.818 --> 47:02.341
Nance! Nance!

47:20.533 --> 47:22.578
HEAVY BREATHING

47:27.583 --> 47:28.846
Nurse.

47:29.324 --> 47:30.325
Nurse.

47:30.369 --> 47:31.805
Nurse.

47:35.765 --> 47:37.289
Nurse!

47:38.072 --> 47:40.335
- Jules, are you OK?
- What's the matter Ms Roth?

47:40.379 --> 47:41.859
I want to stop treatment.

47:41.902 --> 47:43.382
ALL: What?

47:43.425 --> 47:45.819
I wanna go home.
That's where I wanna
be right now.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.039
Oh, thank God!

47:48.082 --> 47:51.564
OK, I may have already
booked a flight to LA.

47:51.607 --> 47:54.436
And we can get you admitted
into Cedars-Sinai right away.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.264
No. You don't understand.

47:56.308 --> 47:58.353
I don't wanna do chemo in LA.

47:58.397 --> 48:00.747
I'm quitting chemotherapy.

48:00.790 --> 48:03.402
Altogether. I just
wanna go home.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.360
EMILIA AND NANCE: What did you
say to her?

48:05.404 --> 48:07.841
It doesn't have anything
to do with them. It's me.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.669
Please, disconnect me.

48:09.712 --> 48:12.280
I don't understand.
What happened?

48:12.324 --> 48:15.631
I got a peek down
the rabbit hole,
and I want out.

48:15.675 --> 48:18.852
Ms Roth, what you're
going through
is typical for a
first treatment.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.333
- Typical, Jules.
- Trust me. Once you
get used to it--

48:21.376 --> 48:23.726
- Gotta get used to it, Jules.
- I don't want to.

48:23.770 --> 48:27.165
That's the whole point.
Please. Disconnect me now.

48:27.208 --> 48:29.689
I can't.
Not without Dr Hanson's order.

48:29.732 --> 48:31.604
Are you kidding me? That jerk?

48:31.647 --> 48:35.042
Or we can forget about the whole
thing and you'll be
finished in...

48:35.086 --> 48:37.958
- less than three hours.
- Sounds good. Let's do that.

48:38.002 --> 48:39.742
- Get him.
- Don't get him.

48:39.786 --> 48:41.396
- Get him.
- Jules, listen to me--

48:41.440 --> 48:45.183
May I please see Dr Hanson, now?

48:45.226 --> 48:47.663
- No, you may not.
- I'm not playing this game.

48:48.577 --> 48:51.189
I have to get the doctor
if that's what the
patient wants.

48:51.232 --> 48:52.538
That's what she wants.

48:53.843 --> 48:54.932
Keep an eye on her.

48:59.632 --> 49:01.155
DOOR CLOSES

49:01.199 --> 49:02.852
Chemotherapy won't cure me.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.245
But it'll buy you time.

49:04.854 --> 49:06.639
Time spent on chemo,

49:06.682 --> 49:09.990
buying more time to
spend on chemo.
It's like a Ponzi scheme.

49:10.034 --> 49:12.950
Time for scientists to make
breakthrough discoveries.

49:12.993 --> 49:15.082
Like that cancer-crushing
turmeric?

49:15.822 --> 49:17.519
I thought it was sage.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.436
Look, either way,
science is advancing.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.526
All the time.
And chemo, it gives
you more time.

49:25.658 --> 49:26.746
How much?

49:27.442 --> 49:29.314
- Could be years.
- How many?

49:29.357 --> 49:33.144
- Ten?
- Ten is maybe a bit optimistic.

49:33.187 --> 49:34.232
Five?

49:34.275 --> 49:36.538
- Let's say three.
- Let's.

49:36.582 --> 49:37.931
And without treatment?

49:38.845 --> 49:41.195
A year. At best.

49:42.718 --> 49:45.634
Can I suggest you
think about it,
take a little bit more time?

49:47.506 --> 49:49.116
What the fuck, Jules?

49:49.160 --> 49:50.596
I can't do it, Nance.

49:50.639 --> 49:52.250
Yes. You can.

49:53.773 --> 49:56.341
I've been talking to Dr Ambrose
at Cedars-Sinai--

49:56.384 --> 49:57.472
What?

49:57.516 --> 49:59.779
I-- I told you not
to tell anyone.

49:59.822 --> 50:02.434
Jules, you gotta
let me fix this,
please.

50:02.477 --> 50:04.958
You can't fix stage
4 cancer, Nancy.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.655
You can't even fix
my casting calls.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.093
That was a cameo.

50:09.136 --> 50:10.311
Bullshit!

50:11.356 --> 50:13.749
I literally don't have time
for bullshit.

50:15.751 --> 50:17.797
I can't do it.

50:20.147 --> 50:22.106
The night Cassie was born,
you also said,

50:22.149 --> 50:24.543
"I can't do it, Nance."

50:25.761 --> 50:26.980
And you did.

50:27.981 --> 50:30.114
And now that baby's
getting married,

50:30.157 --> 50:32.290
and soon enough,
she'll have her own baby.

50:33.378 --> 50:34.901
Who'll need their grandma.

50:34.944 --> 50:36.381
Grandma?

50:38.992 --> 50:42.561
What are you talking
about, Nance?
I'm not gonna be anyone's
grandma.

50:45.303 --> 50:47.348
OK. I'm calling your shrink.

50:47.392 --> 50:48.393
Please don't.

50:49.742 --> 50:52.440
- I actually feel
quite uplifted.
- Oh, you feel uplifted?

50:52.484 --> 50:53.746
Yes.

50:53.789 --> 50:55.052
And powerful.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.185
I'm not resisting,
I'm accepting.

51:03.756 --> 51:07.064
Damn true what they
say about cancer.
It gets your priorities
straight.

51:14.158 --> 51:15.289
If that's what you want.

51:16.203 --> 51:17.335
It is.

51:20.816 --> 51:23.167
I better call Dr Ambrose.

51:23.210 --> 51:26.735
- Tell him we're holding off--
- Not holding off, Nancy.

51:27.301 --> 51:29.390
We're calling the
whole thing off.

51:35.179 --> 51:36.789
- OK?
- OK.

51:50.237 --> 51:52.109
That was not what I meant.

52:01.770 --> 52:03.163
IMAAN: Aren't you scared?

52:03.207 --> 52:05.470
I wish I could say I wasn't.

52:05.513 --> 52:09.126
Then do something
about it, coward.

52:09.169 --> 52:10.692
I'm not a coward.

52:10.736 --> 52:13.260
JUDY: What's the matter?
Is this too hard for you?

52:13.304 --> 52:16.742
Are you scared, you
wanna go home?
Well, tough shit, missus!

52:16.785 --> 52:18.396
Welcome to cancer.

52:18.439 --> 52:19.919
Judy...

52:19.962 --> 52:23.618
You know, my doctor only gave me
two years, two years!

52:23.662 --> 52:25.925
That was six years ago.

52:26.969 --> 52:29.233
Every new drug on the market,

52:29.276 --> 52:31.191
every clinical trial,

52:31.235 --> 52:32.453
every surgery...

52:33.498 --> 52:37.719
I decided that I would be
my cancer's cancer.

52:37.763 --> 52:39.199
And by the time I'd finished,

52:39.243 --> 52:41.332
my cancer's gonna I
wish it was dead.

52:44.987 --> 52:46.163
I have stage 4.

52:48.904 --> 52:51.994
For me, it's not a matter of if,
it's when and how.

52:53.213 --> 52:56.085
And as lovely as you
ladies are...

52:56.129 --> 52:57.391
and you are lovely...

52:59.915 --> 53:02.266
This isn't how I wanna spend
the time I have left.

53:03.745 --> 53:06.966
Well... how do you
want to spend it?

53:07.009 --> 53:08.663
Well, I can tell you one thing.

53:08.707 --> 53:10.796
I'm gonna eat 25 years' worth
of carbs.

53:13.364 --> 53:14.756
I'm not joking.

53:15.801 --> 53:18.804
OK, so this is so great.
So you grab a sponge cake

53:18.847 --> 53:20.936
and then you come back here
to have your chemo.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.590
No.

53:22.634 --> 53:24.549
There's so much more.

53:24.592 --> 53:26.028
I know.

53:28.030 --> 53:31.120
One last grand love affair.

53:31.164 --> 53:32.731
Just like in the movies.

53:32.774 --> 53:35.081
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

53:35.124 --> 53:40.129
God, no! I've had enough
love affairs to last
three lifetimes.

53:41.653 --> 53:43.437
But you know what
I wouldn't mind?

53:44.656 --> 53:46.745
One last first kiss.

53:47.441 --> 53:50.575
Or not even the kiss,
the moment right
before the kiss.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.622
You know, when you get
all kinda tingly inside

53:54.666 --> 53:56.885
and you get butterflies
in your belly.

53:58.322 --> 54:01.194
And you feel like
just a tiny bit queasy.

54:01.238 --> 54:05.067
Oh, God, I would love
to have that feeling again.

54:05.111 --> 54:07.461
If you enjoy being queasy...

54:07.505 --> 54:11.073
I suggest you seriously
reconsider quitting chemo.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.732
But what I really wanna do is...

54:18.559 --> 54:20.082
..spend time with my children.

54:22.171 --> 54:23.999
Not doing anything special.

54:25.349 --> 54:28.134
Just... hangin'.

54:34.662 --> 54:36.795
So, Judy, how about you?
What are you gonna do?

54:38.405 --> 54:39.972
Eh?

54:40.015 --> 54:42.191
If next week is your last chemo,
if it's your last session.

54:48.633 --> 54:49.677
MIKEY: Wow!

54:51.375 --> 54:55.030
This is genuinely the first time
I've ever seen Judy speechless.

54:55.074 --> 54:58.817
Hey, it's OK. You have plenty of
time to plan some
wonderful things.

54:58.860 --> 54:59.905
OK?

55:02.081 --> 55:03.343
Nurse Emilia?

55:04.823 --> 55:06.825
Nurse Emilia, where
is Dr Hanson?

55:06.868 --> 55:09.306
Attending an emergency,
a real emergency, Ms Roth.

55:09.349 --> 55:11.917
- Your agent's in the cafeteria.
- She's my manager,

55:11.960 --> 55:14.920
and I don't need her,
I want Dr Hanson.

55:14.963 --> 55:16.530
MALE PATIENT: Don't
we all, love!

55:25.757 --> 55:28.063
What will your kids say
about you quitting chemo?

55:28.934 --> 55:29.978
Erm...

55:33.199 --> 55:35.027
I hope they'll understand.

55:36.637 --> 55:39.336
Losing your mother is sad
but natural.

55:40.859 --> 55:43.514
I mean,
what else have I
got to give them

55:43.557 --> 55:45.124
if not a happy memory of me?

55:46.473 --> 55:49.998
Millions of dollars,
real estate, royalties.

55:51.173 --> 55:53.480
OK. But besides that.

55:55.656 --> 55:58.137
I've got nothing to leave Annie
except a wig-eating cat

55:58.180 --> 55:59.834
and breast cancer genes.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.707
And debts.

56:03.969 --> 56:07.755
And she's got accepted
onto this PhD programme
in Edinburgh.

56:07.799 --> 56:09.757
It's like a really good one,
apparently.

56:09.801 --> 56:13.021
But she's turning it
down so she can
stay home and look after me.

56:14.588 --> 56:18.200
I know I should tell her
she doesn't need to
but... I haven't.

56:18.244 --> 56:20.246
Forget it. She's not going.

56:21.552 --> 56:23.597
Easier to separate
conjoined twins.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.471
You think you know everything.

56:29.342 --> 56:31.126
You know, before cancer...

56:33.868 --> 56:35.783
Annie hadn't spoken to me
for five years.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.045
- What?
- What?

56:37.089 --> 56:40.179
Seventeen to twenty-two,
not a word.

56:40.222 --> 56:42.834
She moved into a friend's house
in the next street.

56:42.877 --> 56:44.879
Why? What had you done to her?

57:04.464 --> 57:05.509
I'm sorry.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.816
Oh, I've got the full house
of excuses.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.819
You know, I was a single mum,
I was young.

57:13.038 --> 57:15.867
I didn't particularly change
my lifestyle when I had her.

57:15.910 --> 57:16.955
I just...

57:16.998 --> 57:18.522
I just wasn't that into it.

57:21.916 --> 57:24.049
I wasn't into her. Just...

57:26.225 --> 57:27.879
wasn't into being Annie's mum.

57:27.922 --> 57:29.184
I know it sounds awful.

57:31.622 --> 57:35.016
But then the universe
threw me one last lifeline.

57:35.887 --> 57:37.715
A lump in my breast,

57:37.758 --> 57:40.587
that gave us both
a second chance.

57:42.937 --> 57:45.853
Cancer worked a kind
of tragic magic.

57:47.072 --> 57:48.290
And I love it.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.991
I know I should tell her
to go to Edinburgh.

57:54.949 --> 57:56.821
And yet I still don't tell her.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.173
I guess once a shit mum...

58:02.391 --> 58:05.307
Maybe... she's not
doing it for you.

58:08.876 --> 58:11.792
Shitty mum or not,
you're the only mum she's got.

58:13.881 --> 58:16.580
Maybe she wants
to spend time with you.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.278
Well said, Ms Roth.

58:23.325 --> 58:27.329
You know, watching all you mums
makes me feel almost fortunate.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.942
I'm no-one's burden.

58:31.725 --> 58:32.987
So I'm guilt-free.

58:33.771 --> 58:35.033
And when I go...

58:36.034 --> 58:38.036
I'm not abandoning anyone.

58:39.124 --> 58:40.168
Oi.

58:41.996 --> 58:43.041
What about us?

58:43.084 --> 58:44.390
Right, Imaan?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.306
Oh, honey!

58:47.915 --> 58:49.743
Sweetheart, are you OK?

58:53.007 --> 58:54.356
Come on, ladies.

58:58.012 --> 58:59.405
Breathe in.

59:00.841 --> 59:02.234
And out.

59:07.761 --> 59:08.762
Abed?

59:14.986 --> 59:16.291
Sama?

59:37.791 --> 59:41.534
They found my tumour on
a routine pregnancy check-up.

59:41.578 --> 59:45.625
So, thanks to being pregnant,
I was diagnosed relatively
early.

59:45.669 --> 59:48.976
Usually, I never make time to go
to the doctor for
my own check-ups,

59:49.020 --> 59:51.762
but I did it for
the baby, and...

59:51.805 --> 59:54.634
it's what saved my
life. A miracle.

59:55.983 --> 59:57.289
Inshallah.

59:59.073 --> 01:00:03.948
So God giving you cancer
while pregnant at 26...

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:07.865
is God miraculously
saving your life?

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:08.953
Mm.

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:12.957
Oh, you think I don't
have questions.

01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:16.177
Because I do.

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:20.486
Every night before
I fall asleep--
if I fall asleep...

01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:25.883
I lie awake and ask God
all kinds of questions.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.411
Is this a test?

01:00:32.454 --> 01:00:36.284
And if so, is it personal
or more like a random survey?

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:41.289
And why are my children
to blame?

01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:44.815
You know-- you know?

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:48.645
Sorry.

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:56.043
But I can't just stop loving God
because I got sick.

01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:57.349
It doesn't work that way.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.267
And now, more than ever,
whenever I'm scared or...

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.793
or I'm in pain, I
have no greater
comfort than my faith.

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:10.057
And miracles happen.

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.975
Here we go with the
miracles again.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:17.630
Can you help me out, Judy?

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:23.505
I was born in Auschwitz.

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:26.160
Three months before liberation.

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:31.035
And do you know what
the odds were
for a baby to survive
in Auschwitz?

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:35.561
The odds for a healthy adult
surviving in Auschwitz...

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:37.389
was half a percent.

01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:39.652
Half a percent!

01:01:40.522 --> 01:01:43.438
And a baby's odds
were a tenth of that.

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.702
One tenth of half a percent.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.312
There's no such number.

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:51.664
Yet here I am.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.756
Maybe miracles do happen.

01:01:58.671 --> 01:01:59.846
Damn, Judy!

01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.676
Now anything I say
is gonna sound
stupid and childish.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.679
So? Never stopped you before.

01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:09.856
MOBILE PHONE RINGING

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.076
Oh, no, not here. It's
your holiday.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:15.819
You can't keep on
doing everything.

01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:17.777
JULIA: They'll be just fine
without you.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:22.042
That's exactly what
I'm scared of.

01:02:23.087 --> 01:02:24.566
- Hey.
- Everything OK?

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.960
- Yeah, yeah. You got a minute?
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:29.093
You said to call
when I'm making lunch.

01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:31.660
- Yeah, er, get the eggs.
- The eggs...

01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:38.537
There you are.

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:42.802
- I've been waiting for you.
- Sorry, Ms Roth. Just a moment.

01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:44.499
Ms Schwartz...

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:48.068
- Can we, erm?
- Come on, Doctor, spit it out.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.548
It's still growing, isn't it?

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.985
It's not growing.

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:54.727
I knew it.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.078
- Is it shrinking?
- Yes. It is.

01:02:58.122 --> 01:02:59.776
Significantly.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:03.257
And if the shrinkage continues
according to our predictions,

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.737
and I don't see why it won't...

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.567
then in two weeks, Judy,
you can be out of here.

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:12.832
Judy, congratulations.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.138
What did I tell you?

01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:17.228
Woo hoo! Go, Judy!

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:18.533
Judy?

01:03:18.577 --> 01:03:20.187
Ms Schwartz, are you all right?

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:24.539
Hey, hey, hey. It's OK.

01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:28.717
Did you hear what Dr Hanson
just said?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.287
Your tumour's shrinking.

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:36.725
You did it.

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:39.424
You did it.

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.254
Well, what did you expect?

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:47.867
Bloody tumour!
No idea who it was dealing with.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.784
- Poor thing.
- She's back.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.525
Congrats, Judy.

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:56.354
Oh, thank you, Julia.

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.878
Yes, Ms Roth?

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:01.402
Yes. I'm finished, too.

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:05.189
I wanna stop chemotherapy.
Right now.

01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:07.234
OK, OK.

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:10.411
Erm... right. Erm...

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.980
Can we...?

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:21.292
Come on, Doc.
What are you waiting on?

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.946
Disconnect me.

01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:25.818
I'll put it into words
that you can understand.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.953
If you quit chemo,
you'll regret it.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.347
Maybe not today, maybe
not tomorrow,

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:35.872
but soon
and for the rest of your life.

01:04:36.437 --> 01:04:37.482
Well...

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:42.791
it's a good thing the rest of my
life is only gonna be one year.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.972
Sorry to interrupt.
Dr Hanson, the consent form

01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:51.104
we all signed before
starting chemo says that

01:04:51.148 --> 01:04:53.977
patients can stop treatment
at any time.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.152
It does?

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.418
- Is that true?
- Why are you helping her?

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:02.463
You know what quitting
means for her.

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:05.162
Yeah, well, it is
her legal right.

01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:09.253
Yes, it is. Thanks.

01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:11.559
Yes, and it's also your right
to have your doctor

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:13.822
make sure you're not putting
your life at risk.

01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:17.304
- My life is at risk.
- Yes, exactly.

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:20.264
Exactly,
and in a situation like this,

01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:24.572
it's very normal
to have feelings
of anxiety and fear,

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:26.487
- as you must be feeling--
- No, no.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:29.577
Don't you give me your
bedroom-eyes,
soft-voice, sexy-accent thing.

01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:33.320
That might work on them, but
I simply do not have
time for that.

01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:34.495
I have stage 4 cancer.

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:37.498
Yes, I'm aware of that, yes.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.632
But even at your stage,
you can afford another
half an hour

01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:43.113
- just to think things through.
- But it's my right.

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:45.332
And it'll still be your right
in 30 minutes.

01:05:45.376 --> 01:05:46.899
- Wait. No!
- I'll come back then,

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.380
- and we can discuss it.
- No, you gotta disconnect me!

01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.599
Come... Fuck him!

01:05:56.387 --> 01:05:58.215
Who the hell does
he think he is?

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:00.739
FRUSTRATED SIGH

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:04.308
- Hello?
- Barnie.

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:06.005
- Who is this?
- Julia.

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.441
Julia, what time is it?

01:06:07.485 --> 01:06:10.792
Listen carefully.
I'm being held against my will

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:13.360
at the Grove Memorial Clinic,

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:17.974
attached to highly-toxic
chemotherapy by Dr Ben Hanson.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.802
- ..Julia, are you joking?
- No, I'm not joking.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.546
I need you to call
your London office
and have someone sent over here.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.940
- What are you doing?
- Get Emilia.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.248
You could get Dr Hanson fired.

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.990
Fired? I'm gonna get him
thrown in jail.

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:35.861
What are you talking about?

01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:37.689
He is saving our lives.

01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:39.343
I thought that was God?

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.954
Please don't talk
to her like that.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.738
You spoiled, ungrateful--

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:46.567
Hollywood has-been,
yeah, I know I heard you before.

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.395
- Well, guess what--
- What's going on?

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:51.572
Thank goodness!
She's gone completely nuts.

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:54.445
If you don't disconnect me now,
I swear I'm gonna make sure--

01:06:54.488 --> 01:06:56.577
Your agent asked us
not to do anything

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.362
until she gets hold
of your shrink.

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:00.712
- What are you talking about?
- It's her manager.

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.931
- Oh, right, sorry.
- Fuck that!

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:04.629
What did she say? Tell me.

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:07.327
That you'd been emotionally
fragile

01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:09.547
and consumed a large dosage
of tranquillisers

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.331
and alcohol over the weekend,

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.464
and have a history
of mental instability--

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:14.595
Who did she talk to?

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:18.295
Well, me, Dr Hanson,
the hospital trust...

01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:19.513
and the tea lady, I think.

01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:22.125
Regardless, we strongly advise

01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:24.257
against terminating treatment
mid session.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.304
I'm here, Jules.

01:07:29.262 --> 01:07:31.743
I begged Hanson to come
but that jerk is just--

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.353
I'll get Dr Hanson.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.056
You told them
I was mentally unstable?

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.363
Jules, calm down--

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.670
What, are you mad at me for
messing up your comeback plans?

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:48.151
I told you not to stay comeback.
You never left.

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.588
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about you.

01:07:51.415 --> 01:07:53.243
- What?
- Look at you.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.246
All in your element again.

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.597
Phone calls, media exposure,

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.862
talking to my doctors
behind my back,
just like the good old days.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:08.780
My cancer's the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:11.870
[SCOFFS] OK, you are crazy.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:15.047
I'm not crazy. I made a choice.

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:17.832
It's a stupid choice.

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:20.531
One that you'll regret
by tomorrow.

01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:22.054
If not this afternoon.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.012
Who are you to decide?

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.669
Who am I to decide?

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:31.063
Are you kidding me?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.152
Where have you been
for the past three decades?

01:08:34.631 --> 01:08:35.894
Who am I?

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:40.333
I'm the one cleaning up,

01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:43.510
after every stupid, childish,
irrational choice you make,

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:45.685
that's who I am,
you self-centred lunatic.

01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:48.689
I'm the one who goes,
"I'll fix it, Jules,"

01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.952
then runs backstage
to do damage control

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:54.304
and pick up the pieces
after Hurricane Julia.

01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:59.135
I'm the one who flies
down to Cabo
on your wedding night,

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.788
after you've sobered up.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.790
And I'm the one taking care
of the annulment

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:04.227
and handling the press

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.751
while making sure
you don't OD over it.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:09.406
I'm the one who goes
to Nate's parents' weekends

01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:12.059
so that you don't miss
an award ceremony,

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:14.976
and spend that entire weekend
talking him into forgiving you.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.848
Yeah. Oh, and of course,
I'm the one

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:20.068
who gets a tattoo
for her 40th birthday...

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:23.376
at fucking 37.

01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:30.077
That's who I am.
And that's why I get to decide

01:09:30.121 --> 01:09:34.908
that quitting chemo is the most
batshit-crazy and
delusional idea

01:09:34.952 --> 01:09:38.390
you ever came up with
and that we're not doing that.

01:09:40.306 --> 01:09:41.524
Bullshit.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.571
You're just scared
of me leaving.

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.880
You're scared of being alone.

01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.403
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:54.102
Of course, I am, you idiot.
I'm terrified.

01:09:54.146 --> 01:09:55.887
Well, you don't get
to be terrified.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.324
I'm the one who's
dying of cancer.

01:09:58.368 --> 01:09:59.585
Not you.

01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:04.068
Stop feeding off of my drama.

01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:06.853
And get a life.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:09.335
You leech.

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.121
Fuck you.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:26.439
Go ahead.

01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:29.660
Kill yourself.

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:43.326
SOBBING

01:10:50.594 --> 01:10:52.552
SOBBING

01:11:07.698 --> 01:11:10.178
MIKEY: Do you want to try
going on holiday again, Julia?

01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:11.397
Hm?

01:11:12.005 --> 01:11:13.269
Come on.

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:15.967
Where are we?

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.536
I don't know, Mikey.

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:21.407
Seems to me...

01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:24.148
you're in a chemo room
for the third time...

01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.457
fighting a disease
that keeps coming back,

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.763
stuck with a Hollywood has-been,

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:31.722
who just wants to get
the hell outta here.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.906
Nope. That's not it.

01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:52.438
SERENE MUSIC PLAYING

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:04.320
So what were you saying about
eating 25 years' worth of carbs?

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:06.713
It's beautiful.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:09.673
Thank you.

01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:12.284
Oh!

01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.028
Look at that!

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.682
JUDY CHUCKLES

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.473
Do you think she's gonna be OK?

01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:30.346
Yeah, give her a moment.

01:12:30.389 --> 01:12:32.739
Carbs can cure anything.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:33.784
Except cancer.

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:36.352
Oh, my God!

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:39.746
What did I tell you?

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:43.097
You really are Dr Good Vibes.

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.365
So why did you stop
making movies?

01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:53.064
You think stage 4's terminal?

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:57.590
You should try being a woman
in Hollywood over 50.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:02.639
- So sorry.
- Me too.

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.423
But if it's over...

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:07.992
- thisis the way to go.
- Right?

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:11.778
Oh, my gosh!

01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:16.609
I love those.

01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:19.568
I used to look at them in Paris
all the time.

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:26.053
What?

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:28.447
How did you...

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:31.276
Guess I'm one stubborn
leech, huh?

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:34.366
You know, we could really do
with that Nancy leech

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.717
for our next frog expedition.
Don't you think?

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.809
SERENE MUSIC PLAYING

01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:00.000
JULIA: Here you go.

01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:09.053
- Do you take sugar?
- Do I take sugar?

01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:24.982
This wasn't the plan, Jules.

01:14:28.072 --> 01:14:29.465
That was the plan.

01:14:30.943 --> 01:14:32.946
And I need you to stick with it.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.341
Add those circles up.

01:14:39.952 --> 01:14:41.607
But on your birthday, not mine.

01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.482
I insist, Nance.

01:14:54.751 --> 01:14:58.624
You insist? So I'm
supposed to follow
your orders even when
you're dead?

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.407
Talk about leeches, Jules!

01:15:00.452 --> 01:15:03.760
Fuck you. Call it a dying wish.

01:15:03.803 --> 01:15:06.458
That's what it's called, is it?
And also fuck you.

01:15:16.816 --> 01:15:18.688
There is something I, erm...

01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:23.388
really do need you to do for me,
Nancy.

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:26.260
What's that?

01:15:28.262 --> 01:15:30.264
I need you to be
the grandmother.

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.704
[SIGHS] Jesus, Jules.

01:15:37.097 --> 01:15:38.838
You know...

01:15:38.882 --> 01:15:41.537
every kid needs a wacky
grandmother.

01:15:44.148 --> 01:15:46.846
And Jack's mum
is just way too straight.

01:15:49.022 --> 01:15:50.154
Are you insane?

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:53.157
You told them that
I'm holding you hostage?

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.550
- Listen up, buddy--
- Nance.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.596
I've got this.

01:15:57.639 --> 01:16:00.032
Yes. You're holding me
against my will,

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.731
and these are my chains.

01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:04.385
All right, enough of the drama.
This isn't one of your films.

01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:06.648
If it were,
they'd totally kiss at the end.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:10.174
- Is everything OK here?
- I insist you unplug me, now!

01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:13.699
Why don't you fight cancer
the way you fight treatment?

01:16:13.743 --> 01:16:15.571
So you can go home
and change your mind?

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.702
I'm not gonna change my mind,
I swear.

01:16:17.746 --> 01:16:19.705
I'll sign anything
you want me to.

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:21.794
Well, you can't sign anything
in your state.

01:16:23.796 --> 01:16:25.929
Oh, he's right, actually. Erm...

01:16:25.972 --> 01:16:28.192
any statement you sign now
wouldn't be valid,

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:31.369
because you're under
the influence
of some very strong drugs.

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:34.633
So, because of the drugs I'm on,
I'm not competent

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:36.416
to decide to come off
the drugs I'm on?

01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:39.682
Are you serious?

01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:41.858
As we already told
your agent, it's--

01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:46.079
You know what you
are? A cancerist.

01:16:46.123 --> 01:16:48.647
- That's right, a classic
cancerist.
- A what?

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:49.996
Oh, that's someone...

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.912
Oh, shit.
I need everyone to be quiet.

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:55.827
- It's Cassidy.
- Shit! I forgot to call her.

01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:57.134
- Oh, my God.
- I'm serious.

01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:58.875
INDISTINCT CHATTER

01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:00.964
Best chemo session ever--

01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:02.748
[SHOUTING] Shut the fuck up!

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:05.621
It's my daughter.

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:07.623
I really need you to be quiet.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.190
She can't know I'm here.

01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:22.420
Mum! I found the perfect shoes
for the ceremony part.

01:17:22.463 --> 01:17:25.335
Oh, you did? Show me.

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:28.556
Listen to me talking about shoes
like it's the most
important thing.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.907
Can't think of anything
more important right now.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.865
Right? OK...

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.562
-Are you ready?
JULIA: Fill me in.

01:17:35.476 --> 01:17:36.956
Ta-dah!

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:40.873
Those are so pretty!

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:43.659
Thanks.

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:46.139
Where are you, anyway?
I thought you had the fitting.

01:17:46.183 --> 01:17:49.099
Erm... that's tomorrow.

01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:52.406
Nance, come say hi to Cassidy.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:55.148
Come on, Nance. Come say hi.

01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:56.584
She's coming right now.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:00.458
Hey, Cass-Cass. What's
up, sweetie?

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.329
Hey, Aunt Nancy.

01:18:02.373 --> 01:18:04.680
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:06.725
Yep, we're all fine.
Everything's fine.

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:10.686
Oh, Nance, you've got that call,
You know, you've gotta
make a call.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:13.166
Oh, Mum, guess what.

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.429
Jack and I can make it
on Thanksgiving after all.

01:18:15.473 --> 01:18:16.822
You can?

01:18:16.866 --> 01:18:18.737
Oh, but next year
we have to go to Jack's.

01:18:18.781 --> 01:18:21.478
- Who cares about next year?
- Exactly.

01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:24.568
OK, Mum. I love you.

01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:27.353
I love you, doll-face.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:29.922
Oh, Mum, wait.

01:18:29.966 --> 01:18:32.925
- What is it, sweetie?
- I just...

01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:35.580
I feel like you haven't been
completely straightforward

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:37.495
about just how...

01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:39.889
amazing my wedding shoes are.

01:18:41.193 --> 01:18:45.023
Those are the most beautiful,
one-of-a-kind white shoes

01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:48.985
that I have ever laid my eyes on
in my entire life.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:51.248
Right? Thanks for clarifying.

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:52.684
No problem, sweetie.

01:18:53.424 --> 01:18:55.121
I love you.

01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:56.383
Bye, Mum.

01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.996
Wow, she's really good.

01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:02.607

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:25.369
But I am dying.

01:19:27.023 --> 01:19:29.590
So I'd like to do
it right. My way.

01:19:31.462 --> 01:19:34.770
With my hair, no holes
in my body,
no poison in my veins.

01:19:37.684 --> 01:19:39.383
Ever even if you think it's a...

01:19:39.425 --> 01:19:42.299
selfish, vain choice...

01:19:44.388 --> 01:19:45.693
Fuck it.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.130
It's my choice.

01:19:50.698 --> 01:19:52.918
My life, my death.

01:19:57.443 --> 01:20:00.012
My last little attempt...

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:02.188
at a happy ending.

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:06.192
Even if I'm wrong.

01:20:06.889 --> 01:20:08.629
I didn't say you were wrong.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.850
What?

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.505
But I did assume that you were
making this choice in a...

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:17.638
in a state of anxiety
and confusion
without giving it much thought.

01:20:18.596 --> 01:20:19.815
And clearly, I was wrong.

01:20:21.642 --> 01:20:22.818
And I'm sorry.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.298
Come again?

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:26.386
Not a chance.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:30.085
Right, er... let's
get you unplugged.

01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:32.653
Really?

01:20:33.523 --> 01:20:34.830
Really.

01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:43.055
Right, this won't take long.

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.057

I'm in chemo.

01:21:02.031 --> 01:21:04.555
- Yes, you are.
- Hallelujah!

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.907
What have you done to my ward?

01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:15.174
May I make one final request,
Dr Hanson?

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:16.262
Anything, Ms Roth.

01:21:17.437 --> 01:21:18.699
Can I have my arm back?

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.704
I'm so sorry.

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:30.842
There's a cab outside
waiting for you, Jules.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.322
Go back to the hotel.

01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:34.498
I'll fix this.

01:21:35.325 --> 01:21:36.630
Thank you, Nance.

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:43.159
I don't know how to say goodbye.

01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:47.380
Well, luckily, there's protocol.
