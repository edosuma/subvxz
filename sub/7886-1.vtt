01:55.880 --> 01:57.279
Drop it!

02:22.874 --> 02:24.000
Freeze!

02:33.585 --> 02:34.984
Get down behind something.

02:35.019 --> 02:36.281
Somebody get the police!

02:36.321 --> 02:38.016
Get down! Go!

02:58.676 --> 03:01.645
He went that way
in a black Ferrari. Go!

03:20.932 --> 03:22.661
Suspect is heading...

03:23.868 --> 03:25.699
Look out!

04:00.371 --> 04:02.703
Now in pursuit.
Wilshire at Parkview...

04:14.953 --> 04:16.716
Suspect is currently...

04:57.095 --> 04:59.086
Stop! Oh, my God!

05:01.866 --> 05:03.390
Yeah, that's him, all right.

05:03.601 --> 05:04.727
That's Jack.

05:04.769 --> 05:05.736
Real nice man.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.328
Kind of quiet.
Real gentleman.

05:07.538 --> 05:10.336
When was the last time
you saw him?

05:10.541 --> 05:13.908
Oh, I haven't seen him in...
about a week.

05:13.978 --> 05:16.314
What did he do, rob a bank?

05:16.314 --> 05:19.010
Tom, we've got to move.
They've got DeVries.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.677
High-speed pursuit,
West Hollywood.

05:20.718 --> 05:21.844
Thanks.

05:57.288 --> 05:58.653
Phillips.

06:03.695 --> 06:05.629
Let's go.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.255
Yes, sir.

06:07.298 --> 06:10.859
All right, Johnson,
back here with me.

06:25.616 --> 06:27.311
Watch your ass, guys.

06:27.352 --> 06:28.649
Hey, Beck.

06:29.687 --> 06:32.212
How many units
you got in pursuit, Sandy?

06:32.256 --> 06:33.587
Two.

06:34.659 --> 06:35.751
How long?

06:35.793 --> 06:37.351
I wouldn't go for coffee.

06:56.848 --> 06:58.611
There he is.

07:05.723 --> 07:06.951
Give me that.

07:37.555 --> 07:38.681
Tommy, come on!

08:41.586 --> 08:43.554
Mr. DeVries' condition
is deteriorating.

08:43.587 --> 08:46.318
We'll have to move him
back to intensive care.

08:46.357 --> 08:47.654
Think he'll make it, doc?

08:47.692 --> 08:51.651
With all the trauma,
it's a miracle he's still alive.

08:51.696 --> 08:54.098
I doubt he'll last the night.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.258
Good.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.729
Keep us up to date,
will you, doc?

09:02.773 --> 09:03.865
Detective Beck.

09:03.908 --> 09:06.240
No one deserves
to die like that.

09:06.277 --> 09:08.677
I don't care
what the man's done.

09:08.713 --> 09:11.238
He killed twelve people,
wounded twenty-three more...

09:11.282 --> 09:13.910
stole six cars,
mostly Ferraris...

09:13.951 --> 09:15.782
robbed eight banks,
six supermarkets...

09:15.820 --> 09:17.845
four jewelry stores,
and a candy shop.

09:17.889 --> 09:20.255
Six people he carved
with a butcher knife.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.020
Two of them were kids.

09:22.059 --> 09:24.323
If anybody deserves
to go that way...

09:24.529 --> 09:26.793
it sure in the hell was him.

09:33.905 --> 09:37.136
Look, Ed,
Tom Beck is the best I've got.

09:37.175 --> 09:40.110
If I give him to you,
I'll never get him back.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.305
My department will crumble...

09:42.346 --> 09:43.904
crime will run rampant...

09:43.948 --> 09:46.314
the city will fall into ruin...

09:46.350 --> 09:50.184
hordes will control the streets,
and life as we know it will end.

09:50.221 --> 09:53.349
I don't want Willis.
I want Beck.

09:53.558 --> 09:57.289
Senator's coming to announce
he's running for president.

09:57.328 --> 09:58.727
He's gotten some threats.

09:58.763 --> 10:01.630
You don't want some ass
blowing him away.

10:01.666 --> 10:04.602
Ed, Willis is a better man now.

10:04.602 --> 10:06.934
He's been with Beck
for over a year.

10:06.971 --> 10:09.064
Give him another shot.

10:11.642 --> 10:14.167
Send Beck to my office, John.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.715
Lieutenant Masterson.

10:24.755 --> 10:26.780
Yeah, I'm Masterson.
Who are you?

10:26.824 --> 10:28.815
Lloyd Gallagher, FBI.

10:28.859 --> 10:30.793
What can I do for you?

10:30.828 --> 10:31.988
I'm following a suspect.

10:32.029 --> 10:35.055
I need some local
law enforcement help.

10:35.132 --> 10:36.258
I spoke with your captain.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.098
He assigned me
a Detective Thomas Beck.

10:55.286 --> 10:56.651
All right.

11:01.259 --> 11:04.786
Beck. This is agent
Lloyd Gallagher, FBI, Seattle.

11:04.829 --> 11:07.696
You'll be working with him
the next few days.

11:07.732 --> 11:10.701
I'm in the middle of a case.

11:10.735 --> 11:12.862
Am I supposed to drop this?

11:12.903 --> 11:14.632
Doesn't anybody
say please anymore?

11:14.672 --> 11:15.798
Please.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.071
Oh. How can I refuse?

11:19.110 --> 11:20.372
You can't.

11:25.349 --> 11:28.318
Bureau's getting them younger
every day now.

11:28.352 --> 11:31.344
Must get them
right out of high school.

11:35.126 --> 11:37.686
Don't put it on my desk.

11:37.728 --> 11:40.253
Do not put that on my desk.

11:40.298 --> 11:41.731
Give me a break.

11:41.766 --> 11:43.131
I haven't seen my wife
in a month.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.634
She's fine.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.603
I was with her last night.
She said to say hello.

11:46.637 --> 11:49.071
Sends you a big kiss.

11:49.106 --> 11:50.675
She's getting fat.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.109
Yeah, a beer belly or something.

11:57.048 --> 11:59.642
So who we looking for,
public enemy number one?

12:01.185 --> 12:04.018
His name is Jack DeVries.

12:06.223 --> 12:08.191
- Stockbroker?
- Right.

12:08.225 --> 12:09.556
How long you been after him?

12:09.593 --> 12:10.992
About a month.

12:11.028 --> 12:12.552
A month, huh?

12:12.596 --> 12:15.156
Why don't you go
buy yourself a drink?

12:15.199 --> 12:16.291
Why?

12:16.334 --> 12:18.768
He's in the hospital.
He's dying.

12:18.803 --> 12:20.805
- Which hospital?
- St. Joseph's.

12:20.805 --> 12:21.999
First and Main.

12:22.039 --> 12:24.371
He ain't going anywhere.
What's your hurry?

13:35.713 --> 13:37.180
Clear.

13:38.849 --> 13:40.248
Still no rhythm.

13:40.284 --> 13:42.252
Can you feel a pulse?

13:42.286 --> 13:43.378
Nothing.

13:43.587 --> 13:45.953
OK. Let's try it again.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.685
Clear.

13:54.131 --> 13:55.689
Doctor, are you OK?

13:55.733 --> 13:56.825
Yeah, I'm OK.

13:56.867 --> 13:57.959
What happened?

13:58.002 --> 13:59.299
I don't know.

14:02.006 --> 14:03.633
Doctor.

14:11.916 --> 14:14.885
I got one patient
dead on the floor.

14:14.919 --> 14:17.888
Are you saying
a man in his condition...

14:17.922 --> 14:20.322
walked the hell out of here?

14:20.357 --> 14:22.689
He left when I went after you.

14:22.726 --> 14:24.091
What do you mean?

14:26.230 --> 14:27.663
Can I help you?

14:34.104 --> 14:35.901
FBI.

14:35.940 --> 14:39.034
Mr. Miller has an extremely
bad stomach condition.

14:39.076 --> 14:40.304
Severe gastritis.

14:40.344 --> 14:43.313
His heart deteriorated
to where we had to schedule...

14:43.347 --> 14:44.712
a triple bypass.

14:44.748 --> 14:48.650
Yesterday afternoon
he had a massive coronary...

14:48.686 --> 14:51.246
but today it was as if he just...

14:51.288 --> 14:52.983
Got up and walked out.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.991
I can't really explain it...

14:55.025 --> 14:58.654
but I know that's not the man
you're looking for.

14:58.696 --> 15:01.927
Jonathan Miller would never
do anything to break the law.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.764
He's a very kind,
honest gentleman.

15:16.714 --> 15:17.874
Grandpa!

15:18.883 --> 15:21.875
What are you,
stupid or something?

15:25.589 --> 15:27.648
I'm talking to you, wank.

15:28.592 --> 15:29.718
I said I'm...

15:33.063 --> 15:34.997
I'm going to kill you.

16:22.813 --> 16:23.939
Asshole.

16:35.726 --> 16:37.694
Beck, we should get started.

16:37.728 --> 16:39.063
On what?

16:39.063 --> 16:42.362
I got a news flash for you...
DeVries is dead.

16:46.804 --> 16:49.139
Who's this,
public enemy number two?

16:49.139 --> 16:51.699
His name is Jonathan P. Miller.

16:51.742 --> 16:53.733
I need to find him.

17:02.086 --> 17:04.919
Get away. Do not put that...

17:04.954 --> 17:07.981
Beck, it wasn't funny
the first time.

17:08.025 --> 17:09.890
This better be good.

17:14.164 --> 17:15.722
Quite the desperado.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.736
Still handing out
the death penalty...

17:18.736 --> 17:20.226
for unpaid traffic tickets?

17:25.909 --> 17:28.036
I don't do traffic tickets.

17:43.794 --> 17:48.197
You got a body at a record shop
on Melrose and Stanley.

17:51.902 --> 17:53.893
What is it, a full moon?

17:56.940 --> 17:59.340
How's it going, Sarge?

17:59.376 --> 18:01.936
Hey, Frankie, how's it going?

18:01.979 --> 18:03.947
You check the back room?

18:03.981 --> 18:05.380
Yeah. It's clear.

18:10.154 --> 18:12.145
What have we got here?

18:13.190 --> 18:15.715
Hey, Beck, there's a witness.

18:15.759 --> 18:18.728
Apparently she came in
right after it happened.

18:18.762 --> 18:21.253
She got a good look at the guy.

18:21.298 --> 18:22.560
Where is she?

18:22.599 --> 18:23.691
Right here.

18:23.734 --> 18:26.168
Yeah. He was carrying a radio.

18:33.911 --> 18:35.879
What are you doing here?

18:35.913 --> 18:38.882
I'm checking on a couple
of traffic tickets.

18:38.916 --> 18:40.042
Come here.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.544
Sanchez, call the coroner.

18:44.588 --> 18:47.580
See if he can come
sometime today.

18:48.859 --> 18:51.293
That way over there.

18:51.328 --> 18:53.888
How tall would you say he was?

18:53.931 --> 18:56.695
What does this
have to do with you?

18:56.734 --> 18:57.962
You're out of line.

18:58.001 --> 18:59.969
The guy you want is dead.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.595
Your job is done.

19:01.638 --> 19:05.233
I suggest you take
the next flight to Seattle.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.116
How we doing here?

19:15.152 --> 19:16.278
Hey, Sarge.

19:18.322 --> 19:19.949
What do you think?

19:22.025 --> 19:23.117
Is this him?

19:23.160 --> 19:24.286
It's him.

19:28.232 --> 19:30.757
Brem, print this
and circulate it.

19:30.801 --> 19:32.736
Put out a felony warrant
on Jonathan P. Miller...

19:32.736 --> 19:34.067
armed and dangerous.

19:34.104 --> 19:35.696
Shall we get started?

19:37.808 --> 19:39.969
You have that picture of Miller?

19:45.616 --> 19:46.844
Use this instead.

19:46.884 --> 19:49.284
How did you know about Miller?

19:49.319 --> 19:50.843
He worked with DeVries.

19:50.888 --> 19:52.913
Pulling illegal U-turns?

19:52.956 --> 19:55.584
He didn't have a record
till two weeks ago.

19:55.626 --> 19:56.718
Long before that.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.954
Not according to our files.

19:57.995 --> 19:59.792
No. According to our files.

20:02.199 --> 20:05.225
If you want my help,
tell me what's going on.

20:05.269 --> 20:07.703
A criminal's come to your city.

20:07.738 --> 20:10.140
You've been assigned
to help me find him.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.698
If it's that simple...

20:11.742 --> 20:14.711
why's the Bureau
sending you down here?

20:14.745 --> 20:15.837
You don't have
anything on Miller...

20:15.879 --> 20:18.211
because he's always
changing his identity.

20:18.248 --> 20:20.808
You didn't have anything
on DeVries...

20:20.851 --> 20:23.820
until you caught up
with him as DeVries.

20:23.854 --> 20:26.823
Before that,
he was Arvin J. Lusk.

20:26.857 --> 20:29.382
Before that, William Butler.

20:29.593 --> 20:31.595
Miller does the same thing.

20:31.595 --> 20:33.995
This is the closest I've been.

20:34.031 --> 20:37.398
He's got to be stopped
before he moves again.

20:37.634 --> 20:39.033
We'll take my car.

20:43.207 --> 20:45.004
Let's go.

21:04.261 --> 21:06.627
Bureau must be paying
pretty good these days.

21:06.663 --> 21:07.789
Pretty good.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.233
Mind me asking how much
one of these costs?

21:23.680 --> 21:24.908
How much?

21:24.948 --> 21:26.347
I don't know.

21:27.951 --> 21:29.350
You don't know.

21:29.386 --> 21:31.877
What did you do, steal it?

22:10.994 --> 22:13.827
Hey, can you turn that down?

22:13.864 --> 22:16.196
Order up on number three.

22:19.937 --> 22:22.872
One coffee, right?

22:29.046 --> 22:32.846
Senator Holt is drawing a crowd
wherever he goes.

22:32.883 --> 22:35.647
The senator, who was expected
to announce his candidacy...

22:35.686 --> 22:38.120
for president
in Los Angeles tomorrow...

22:38.155 --> 22:41.647
is in town to dedicate a new
branch of Child Help U.S.A.

22:43.794 --> 22:45.762
The work of this organization...

22:45.762 --> 22:48.754
in bettering the lives
of young people here...

22:48.799 --> 22:51.097
stands as an example...

22:51.134 --> 22:53.193
that government
can and should serve...

22:53.236 --> 22:56.000
the needs of the small
as well as the giant.

22:59.843 --> 23:00.935
Senator, is it true...

23:00.978 --> 23:03.276
you'll be announcing
your campaign plans Tuesday?

23:03.313 --> 23:05.838
You'll have to wait
till next Tuesday.

23:05.882 --> 23:07.543
Bye, guys. Thank you.

23:07.584 --> 23:08.983
And now Capitol Hill.

23:09.019 --> 23:11.988
An old ship
is making new waves...

23:23.066 --> 23:24.590
It's your table, honey.

23:24.634 --> 23:25.965
Don't look at me.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.341
How far is St. Joseph's
from here?

24:12.549 --> 24:13.811
About a mile.
Why?

24:13.850 --> 24:15.841
Which direction?

24:15.886 --> 24:18.184
We'll start up here
and work back.

24:18.221 --> 24:19.779
You're calling the shots now?

24:19.823 --> 24:21.814
I know how the suspect operates.
There's little time.

24:21.892 --> 24:23.223
How do you know Miller
was at the hospital?

24:23.260 --> 24:24.727
A hunch.

24:24.761 --> 24:26.820
What, was he visiting DeVries?

24:26.863 --> 24:30.890
Just tell me. Let's cut out
the Twenty Questions.

24:30.934 --> 24:32.060
We're on the same side.

24:32.102 --> 24:36.095
Miller came from the hospital.
He was there to see DeVries.

24:36.139 --> 24:38.630
That's illuminating.
That solves everything.

24:38.675 --> 24:40.677
Miller doesn't have a chance.

24:40.677 --> 24:42.679
Why would he kill a guy...

24:42.679 --> 24:45.079
for a lousy hundred dollars
and a radio?

24:45.115 --> 24:46.673
'Cause he likes it.

24:46.716 --> 24:49.685
He sees something he wants,
he steals it.

24:49.719 --> 24:51.949
Something gets in his way,
he kills it.

24:51.988 --> 24:54.957
And right now,
he's hiding out in your city.

24:54.991 --> 24:57.858
You're talking about Miller.
Sounds more like DeVries.

24:57.894 --> 25:00.294
Could you be a little confused?

25:19.082 --> 25:20.344
So, you impressed?

25:21.885 --> 25:23.011
I'm impressed.

25:24.821 --> 25:27.790
That's because this car
makes an impression.

25:27.824 --> 25:30.793
The question is,
do I trade in my Mercedes...

25:30.827 --> 25:33.227
or just hang on to it?

25:33.263 --> 25:34.594
I want this car.

25:34.631 --> 25:36.599
I'll bet you do, dear.

25:36.633 --> 25:39.033
Shall we go to my office?

25:39.069 --> 25:40.627
Yeah.
Excuse me.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.843
Sir, please.
Don't. Don't.

25:52.849 --> 25:54.248
It's not a toy.

25:54.284 --> 25:56.912
Just let me finish
with this gentleman...

25:56.953 --> 25:59.353
and I'll show you another car.

25:59.389 --> 26:00.913
I want this car.

26:00.957 --> 26:02.356
This car is sold.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.684
Thank you.

26:06.563 --> 26:08.224
Hey, buddy.

26:08.265 --> 26:10.233
I'm buying this car.

26:10.267 --> 26:11.859
Don't touch it.

26:15.305 --> 26:17.102
We get occasional mental cases.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.630
I'll take care of it.
Eddie!

26:24.748 --> 26:25.874
Come in.

26:32.355 --> 26:34.789
Hey, dickhead.

26:36.193 --> 26:38.855
What do you think you're doing?

26:38.895 --> 26:40.726
I need the keys.

26:40.764 --> 26:42.891
Fine.
Out of the car.

26:49.239 --> 26:50.866
Don't come back.

26:50.907 --> 26:53.808
I won't be as friendly
next time.

27:00.684 --> 27:02.914
What is your problem?

27:02.953 --> 27:04.181
You understand English?

27:04.221 --> 27:06.280
Beat it!

27:06.323 --> 27:08.917
You want a broken nose,
you got it.

27:14.798 --> 27:16.163
What was that?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.757
Just a backfire.

27:17.801 --> 27:20.065
Not one of yours, I hope.

27:20.103 --> 27:22.628
No way, my friend.

27:22.672 --> 27:24.902
Have some more.
It's good stuff.

27:24.941 --> 27:26.203
Thank you.

27:26.243 --> 27:29.110
How you doing?

27:29.145 --> 27:31.170
Feeling good now, huh?

27:31.214 --> 27:33.307
You'll feel good when you do
a hundred with this baby.

27:33.350 --> 27:35.250
A hundred? In the city?

27:35.285 --> 27:37.219
In the city.
Where else?

27:37.254 --> 27:39.017
Anybody can do it
on the freeway.

27:41.858 --> 27:43.689
I'm busy!

27:43.727 --> 27:45.786
I want the car!

27:47.797 --> 27:50.561
What the hell is that wacko
still doing here?

27:50.600 --> 27:51.760
Give me a minute.

27:53.570 --> 27:56.266
What the hell is Eddie
doing out there?

27:58.375 --> 28:00.104
Oh, my God.

28:02.646 --> 28:04.671
I need the keys.

28:05.382 --> 28:06.644
Give him the keys.

28:06.683 --> 28:08.275
I just signed the paper.

28:08.318 --> 28:09.910
Give him the fucking keys!

28:13.189 --> 28:14.315
Thank you.

28:34.611 --> 28:37.580
We got a couple of cars
out there with plates on them.

28:37.647 --> 28:41.242
One, a three-oh-eight,
to Anthony Mercurio.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.776
Another one, a Mercedes
registered to Anchor lmports.

28:44.821 --> 28:46.789
I think it's this stiff's here.

28:46.823 --> 28:48.791
No name.
His wallet was lifted.

28:48.825 --> 28:50.349
We're running it down now.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.993
Anybody contacted the owner?

28:52.028 --> 28:53.256
It's in the works.

28:53.296 --> 28:57.062
Contact him. Check inventory
for anything missing.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.568
They were finishing a deal
for a red Mondial.

28:59.602 --> 29:00.762
It's not here.

29:00.804 --> 29:01.998
He took it.

29:03.006 --> 29:04.371
How do you know?

29:04.574 --> 29:05.871
He likes Ferraris.

29:09.879 --> 29:12.939
Put out a want and felony
warrant on the Ferrari.

29:12.982 --> 29:14.074
Gotcha.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.242
Come on.

29:15.285 --> 29:16.912
Four dead bodies in four hours.

29:16.953 --> 29:19.148
I want Miller now!

29:35.238 --> 29:36.705
Get in.

29:53.790 --> 29:55.883
We could go over there.

29:58.228 --> 30:00.719
Fuck off!

30:38.134 --> 30:41.126
Know what bothers me
about DeVries and Miller?

30:41.171 --> 30:43.139
Neither has a criminal record.

30:43.173 --> 30:46.939
Both led normal lives,
and now they're killing people.

30:46.976 --> 30:50.207
You read minds,
or was that a shot in the dark?

30:50.246 --> 30:51.838
I read minds.

30:51.881 --> 30:53.974
Oh, yeah?
What was I just thinking?

30:54.017 --> 30:55.245
That I'm full of shit.

30:55.285 --> 30:56.411
Impressive.

30:56.619 --> 30:58.712
Not really.
Pretty simple to read.

31:07.564 --> 31:08.929
I don't read minds.

31:08.965 --> 31:12.799
Are you doing your job,
or is this something personal?

31:12.836 --> 31:15.805
I guess you could say
it's personal.

31:15.839 --> 31:17.602
He killed my partner.

31:20.844 --> 31:22.004
Which one?

31:23.046 --> 31:25.742
Which one killed your partner?

31:25.782 --> 31:26.942
Both.

31:28.384 --> 31:30.978
I'm surprised the Bureau
let you stay on the case.

31:31.054 --> 31:32.385
I hear they're not big
on revenge.

31:34.257 --> 31:36.817
What would you do?

31:36.860 --> 31:38.191
As a cop?

31:38.228 --> 31:39.820
As a man.

31:42.599 --> 31:44.897
I lost a partner once.

31:47.170 --> 31:48.728
We'll get Miller.

34:36.105 --> 34:37.868
Buckley owns Anchor lmports...

34:37.907 --> 34:39.601
which owns the Mercedes.

34:39.641 --> 34:42.110
Let's see if Mr. Buckley
has a record.

34:45.348 --> 34:48.681
Looks like this guy's
an arms dealer.

34:48.717 --> 34:50.275
Carrying a concealed weapon...

34:50.319 --> 34:52.014
possession
of narcotics for sale...

34:52.054 --> 34:54.683
firearms possession...

34:54.724 --> 34:56.692
Another law-abiding citizen,
huh?

35:00.096 --> 35:02.087
What the hell is that?

35:02.131 --> 35:03.792
Flamethrower.
You believe it?

35:03.833 --> 35:07.735
Patrol grabbed it
from some homeboy on the street.

35:07.770 --> 35:10.796
What happened to the days
of zip guns?

35:10.840 --> 35:13.638
Get two units
to his home and office now.

35:14.644 --> 35:16.009
Sanchez.
Homicide.

35:16.045 --> 35:17.137
Sure, hold on.

35:17.180 --> 35:19.171
Beck, I think it's your wife.

35:23.352 --> 35:25.684
Hi. No, I'm sorry.

35:25.722 --> 35:27.713
About fifteen minutes.

35:31.561 --> 35:34.291
Hold on. What are you
doing for dinner?

35:34.330 --> 35:37.060
Sorry. I got plans.
You know, ladies.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.727
Not you, Sanchez.

35:41.904 --> 35:42.996
No plans.

35:43.039 --> 35:45.337
I'm bringing somebody
for dinner.

35:55.218 --> 35:56.617
You coming?

35:59.255 --> 36:01.314
I suppose you live in a castle.

36:01.357 --> 36:04.793
Apartment.
One bedroom, one bath.

36:13.169 --> 36:15.137
Want a beer or something?

36:15.171 --> 36:16.729
Whatever you're having.

37:16.999 --> 37:19.695
"She climbed up
on his long tail...

37:19.735 --> 37:21.726
"and walked up his back.

37:21.771 --> 37:24.604
"When she was comfortable,
they walked on.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.131
"They reached the end
of the forest...

37:27.176 --> 37:30.145
"and the fairy princess
began to laugh with joy.

37:30.179 --> 37:33.740
"There was the shiny castle
on the mountaintop..."

37:33.783 --> 37:35.182
And here's Daddy.

37:36.652 --> 37:37.744
Hi, Mommy.

37:37.787 --> 37:40.189
Hi, baby.
How was your day?

37:40.189 --> 37:41.315
Interesting.

37:41.357 --> 37:42.756
Hi, Daddy.

37:42.792 --> 37:44.623
How's my girl?

37:45.795 --> 37:46.887
Boy!

37:46.929 --> 37:48.658
Did you feed your turtle?

37:49.365 --> 37:51.833
Wait till you see
the painting she did.

37:51.868 --> 37:54.132
She's got it
on the refrigerator already.

37:55.371 --> 37:57.271
Who've we got for dinner?

37:57.306 --> 37:58.603
FBI.

37:58.641 --> 38:01.166
Well, at least they're polite.

38:04.747 --> 38:07.944
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were standing there.

38:09.719 --> 38:11.687
Honey, this is Lloyd Gallagher.

38:11.721 --> 38:13.552
This is my wife Barbara.

38:13.589 --> 38:16.820
It's very nice to have you
with us, Lloyd.

38:16.859 --> 38:19.191
It's nice to be here, Barbara.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.925
I don't mean to disturb you.

38:22.965 --> 38:24.933
That's OK.
Come on in.

38:24.967 --> 38:26.935
This is our daughter Juliet.

38:26.969 --> 38:29.267
Want to say good night
to Mr. Gallagher?

38:56.933 --> 38:58.264
Good night, baby.

39:30.733 --> 39:34.032
Well, um... Tommy tells me
you're from Seattle.

39:36.839 --> 39:37.965
I'm sorry?

39:40.042 --> 39:41.600
You're from Seattle?

39:41.644 --> 39:45.774
Where you're going back to
when you're done here.

39:47.316 --> 39:50.308
Yes.
I'll go home when I'm finished.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.913
Is that where
you're from originally?

39:55.024 --> 39:56.150
From?

39:59.061 --> 40:01.052
Where did you grow up?

40:08.971 --> 40:10.302
What's that, north?

40:11.307 --> 40:14.140
I have some relatives up north.

40:14.176 --> 40:15.302
What town?

40:20.116 --> 40:21.208
Ras Alhague.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.219
And that's in the United States?

40:24.253 --> 40:27.347
Well, I never heard of that one.

40:33.929 --> 40:35.590
Your little girl.

40:39.702 --> 40:40.964
She's very...

40:42.405 --> 40:43.963
special.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.071
Yeah, I think so.

40:49.111 --> 40:50.703
You love her.

40:50.746 --> 40:53.715
Yes, we love her.
She's our daughter.

40:53.749 --> 40:56.013
Don't FBI agents
love their kids?

40:56.052 --> 40:57.713
Tommy, I don't think he...

40:59.889 --> 41:01.379
What about you?

41:01.624 --> 41:02.750
You married?

41:04.760 --> 41:06.591
- I was.
- Kids?

41:06.629 --> 41:08.722
- One.
- Divorced?

41:08.764 --> 41:10.197
My wife is dead.

41:16.639 --> 41:20.973
She and my little girl...

41:21.010 --> 41:25.071
were killed by the man
who killed my partner.

41:27.983 --> 41:29.382
I'm very sorry.

41:43.132 --> 41:44.599
Take it all off!

41:52.374 --> 41:55.605
I love you, darling!
I love you!

41:55.644 --> 41:57.043
That's my wife
you're talking about!

42:45.161 --> 42:47.959
Freddie, can I have
a bourbon and soda?

42:47.997 --> 42:50.090
You got it.
OK.

42:57.339 --> 42:59.739
Hey, buddy, you OK?

43:00.943 --> 43:02.911
I said are you OK?

43:02.945 --> 43:04.936
You look kind of pasty.

43:05.915 --> 43:07.041
I'm fine.

43:09.552 --> 43:10.746
Sure.

44:17.086 --> 44:20.920
This is six Adam forty-two
requesting assistance.

44:20.956 --> 44:22.981
We have located missing Ferrari.

44:28.197 --> 44:29.323
Where?

44:30.699 --> 44:32.223
I'm on my way.

44:44.847 --> 44:46.815
Let's go, Lloyd.

44:46.849 --> 44:49.044
We got to get going.
They found the Ferrari.

44:49.084 --> 44:50.847
Brought you some Alka-Seltzer.

44:55.991 --> 44:57.083
It's Alka-Seltzer.

44:57.126 --> 45:00.653
You put it in water
and drink it.

45:07.169 --> 45:09.262
Lloyd, as a friend...

45:09.305 --> 45:10.932
stay away from alcohol.

45:22.651 --> 45:24.050
Give me a break.

45:27.656 --> 45:30.056
Hey, pal, the show's over, OK?

45:33.796 --> 45:36.230
Can you take it outside, please?

45:37.166 --> 45:38.292
Please?

45:40.602 --> 45:41.728
Hey, Robbie!

45:56.352 --> 45:58.320
All right, man, come on.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.090
Let's go!

46:13.135 --> 46:15.695
Shit!

46:15.738 --> 46:17.000
Hey, officer!

46:17.039 --> 46:20.031
We didn't do nothing!

46:20.075 --> 46:22.771
We're clean.

46:22.811 --> 46:24.608
Hey, baby.

46:24.646 --> 46:26.273
How you doing?

46:26.315 --> 46:28.146
Hey, where you going?

46:28.183 --> 46:31.949
I thought the show was inside.

46:31.987 --> 46:34.353
Stay away from that Ferrari,
please.

46:34.556 --> 46:36.956
Ma'am?
That's a police suspect vehicle.

46:42.965 --> 46:44.125
Yo, baby!

46:45.234 --> 46:48.203
Hey, honey, you know,
what's your hurry?

46:48.237 --> 46:51.140
The night's still young, and...

46:51.140 --> 46:54.337
Your name is Brenda, right?

46:54.376 --> 46:57.038
I seen you before.

46:57.079 --> 46:58.774
Say, uh...

46:59.948 --> 47:01.347
Do you like cars?

47:02.651 --> 47:06.917
'Cause I got a great car,
and it's, uh...

47:06.955 --> 47:09.719
parked right over there
in that lot.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.518
What do you say?

47:16.732 --> 47:17.858
Yeah, baby.

47:17.900 --> 47:20.300
Come on.

47:21.904 --> 47:23.872
What have we got here?

47:23.906 --> 47:26.841
Been a long time
since we've seen one of these.

47:26.875 --> 47:28.843
What the hell's this?

47:28.877 --> 47:30.868
Looks like he's bled to death.

47:30.913 --> 47:32.073
What, from this?

47:32.114 --> 47:33.342
You find a weapon?

47:33.549 --> 47:35.176
No weapon, I.D., nothing.

47:35.217 --> 47:37.845
This is getting stale, Tom.

47:37.886 --> 47:39.285
Check on the coroner.

47:39.321 --> 47:41.812
I'll get you an E.T.A.

47:41.857 --> 47:43.757
Sir...

47:43.792 --> 47:45.089
Here's some aspirin, sir.

47:45.127 --> 47:46.890
Beck thought
you might need them.

48:13.322 --> 48:15.187
What are you doing?

49:16.151 --> 49:19.120
Yo, Beck. Caught beautiful here
trying to leave.

49:19.154 --> 49:22.123
She's the one
that found the body.

49:22.157 --> 49:23.886
Let me have a minute.

49:24.927 --> 49:27.657
Sorry.
It's been a hell of a night.

49:27.696 --> 49:28.822
Are you OK?

49:29.898 --> 49:32.924
Can you tell me what you saw?

49:32.968 --> 49:36.028
I saw Brenda walk out
on my way in.

49:36.071 --> 49:38.039
This guy was on the floor.

49:38.073 --> 49:40.337
I screamed, and the cops came.

49:40.542 --> 49:42.533
You ever seen this guy before?

49:45.314 --> 49:47.748
You sure
you never seen this guy?

49:47.783 --> 49:49.184
I know Brenda.

49:49.184 --> 49:52.187
She'd never have anything
to do with that creep.

49:52.187 --> 49:55.088
- Beck.
- What?

49:55.123 --> 49:57.057
We need to find her.

49:58.126 --> 50:01.061
You trying to tell me
that she's part of this?

50:01.096 --> 50:04.293
Hey, Tom, you ain't going
to believe this.

50:04.333 --> 50:05.823
We have another stiff.

50:05.867 --> 50:07.994
In the parking lot.

50:09.004 --> 50:10.767
I don't believe this.

50:10.806 --> 50:12.865
Thank you for your help.

50:12.908 --> 50:15.638
What's he doing
with his pants down?

50:15.677 --> 50:18.305
What the hell
you think he's doing?

50:18.347 --> 50:20.144
Busy night, huh, Beck?

50:20.182 --> 50:22.047
Getting a little crowded
in my van, you know?

50:22.084 --> 50:24.314
Joey, let me know
when this guy gets posted.

50:24.353 --> 50:25.615
Yeah, right.

50:25.654 --> 50:27.212
- Cliff, get these out.
- Gotcha.

50:27.255 --> 50:29.120
Come here.

50:36.298 --> 50:39.665
In a span of twelve hours,
I've got five bodies...

50:39.701 --> 50:41.066
not counting Miller...

50:41.103 --> 50:43.833
who dies because he
runs out of blood.

50:43.872 --> 50:45.635
A stripper
screws some guy to death...

50:45.674 --> 50:47.801
steals his car, and takes off.

50:47.843 --> 50:49.868
All this in twelve hours.

50:49.911 --> 50:52.277
I ask you, am I crazy...

50:52.314 --> 50:55.010
or does this seem
just a little bizarre?

50:57.052 --> 50:59.020
Yeah, it's a little bizarre.

51:01.623 --> 51:03.625
I knew that.

51:03.625 --> 51:07.117
I just wanted to know
if you knew that.

51:22.611 --> 51:24.169
Let's get out of here.

51:40.095 --> 51:42.154
Step out of the car slowly.

51:42.197 --> 51:45.030
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

51:59.047 --> 52:02.039
It's going to be
one of those nights.

52:03.351 --> 52:05.046
Watch it!

52:19.201 --> 52:20.668
Shit.

52:24.806 --> 52:27.036
Holy smoke.

52:28.043 --> 52:30.637
Suspect is armed
and headed eastbound.

52:30.679 --> 52:33.739
I'd say we're going
the right way.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.845
There it is.

52:57.606 --> 52:59.164
You bitch.

53:16.591 --> 53:18.183
Shit!

53:18.226 --> 53:20.353
God damn it!

53:24.766 --> 53:26.791
Why not try for the tires?

53:26.835 --> 53:28.268
I'm trying to.

53:28.303 --> 53:30.635
You think it's easy?
Why don't you try it?

53:33.809 --> 53:35.140
Son of a...

53:39.915 --> 53:41.382
Hold the wheel.

53:41.583 --> 53:43.710
You hold it.
You wanted to...

53:43.752 --> 53:45.083
What are you doing?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.610
Jesus!

53:55.297 --> 53:57.857
You're out of your damn mind!

54:20.789 --> 54:22.188
You're fucking nuts.

54:32.234 --> 54:33.792
I'm going in.

54:37.239 --> 54:38.797
I'll cover you.

54:39.941 --> 54:42.739
I'd be safer if you didn't.

54:42.777 --> 54:44.301
Fine. I won't cover you.

54:45.847 --> 54:47.075
All right. Cover me.

54:47.115 --> 54:49.948
Want me to cover you or not?

54:49.985 --> 54:52.215
I need you to cover me.

54:52.254 --> 54:53.846
Fine. I'll cover you.

54:56.224 --> 54:57.350
Jesus Christ.

57:05.086 --> 57:08.180
She's bleeding to death.
Why doesn't she go down?

57:08.223 --> 57:10.521
We got to get to her
before she dies.

57:10.558 --> 57:12.150
Why don't we wait
till after she's dead?

59:46.581 --> 59:48.845
You think it's over now.

59:49.851 --> 59:51.682
You're wrong.

59:57.559 --> 01:00:00.960
I'm not coming out yet.

01:00:04.999 --> 01:00:07.661
I'll kill you first.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.199
Roy, come...

01:00:40.235 --> 01:00:41.668
God!

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:58.310
Lieutenant.

01:00:58.353 --> 01:00:59.877
Yeah, Willis,
what's your status?

01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:01.855
Broad just jumped, around back.

01:01:03.124 --> 01:01:04.853
Go on ahead.

01:01:12.934 --> 01:01:14.128
- Halt!
- FBI!

01:01:14.168 --> 01:01:15.931
Get away from the body!

01:01:20.108 --> 01:01:22.941
The party's over, pal.
She's dead.

01:01:22.977 --> 01:01:25.309
She's dead, Lieutenant.
Hell of a night, huh?

01:01:25.346 --> 01:01:27.280
Who was here?
Who touched the body?

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:28.805
She's dead, Mr. Gallagher.

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.818
It's over.

01:01:30.885 --> 01:01:31.977
Nelson, this is Willis.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.648
Check on the coroner's
arrival for me.

01:01:34.689 --> 01:01:37.089
Better bring in the
Robbery /Homicide shooting team.

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:42.956
What's going on up there?

01:01:42.997 --> 01:01:44.396
You want us up there?

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.034
You want to make
some room there?

01:01:54.075 --> 01:01:55.337
Move 'em out of the way.

01:01:55.376 --> 01:01:56.638
Gurney coming through.

01:01:56.711 --> 01:01:57.837
Joey.

01:02:00.081 --> 01:02:02.345
Hey, look,
it's none of my business...

01:02:02.383 --> 01:02:05.784
but the lady had
fifteen bullet holes in her.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.550
You guys like
making my job miserable, huh?

01:02:10.325 --> 01:02:12.885
Shouldn't you go
to the ambulance now?

01:02:12.927 --> 01:02:14.690
Just give me a minute.

01:02:16.264 --> 01:02:18.061
It's not over, is it?

01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:22.092
I want an explanation.

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:28.036
Explanation won't help you.

01:02:30.712 --> 01:02:32.737
I've worked homicide
for thirteen years...

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.305
and I've seen
a lot of strange shit.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:38.342
But I have never
seen anything like this.

01:02:38.386 --> 01:02:40.980
You know what's going on,
and I don't.

01:02:41.022 --> 01:02:42.284
You're going to tell me.

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:44.120
Explanation's
not going to help you.

01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:46.718
I'll decide that.

01:02:49.997 --> 01:02:51.760
Then I'm sorry.

01:02:51.799 --> 01:02:54.165
Hey!
Don't you walk away from me.

01:02:57.805 --> 01:03:00.831
What I'm after
is still out there...

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:03.867
and I don't know where to start.

01:03:11.953 --> 01:03:13.921
Tommy, what happened to you?

01:03:13.955 --> 01:03:15.356
Arrest him.

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:16.880
Arrest him?

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:18.050
Book him.

01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:28.129
Lloyd...
I've got to take you downtown.

01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:29.568
Boss' orders.

01:03:48.723 --> 01:03:50.020
Come on.

01:03:57.131 --> 01:04:00.134
Woodfield,
what are you doing up so late?

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:01.692
Having a ball.

01:04:01.736 --> 01:04:03.260
I heard you took one.
You OK?

01:04:03.304 --> 01:04:04.737
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

01:04:23.124 --> 01:04:25.058
I woke you, huh?

01:04:26.561 --> 01:04:27.687
No, I'm fine.

01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:28.854
I'm fine.

01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:30.158
If I wasn't fine...

01:04:30.198 --> 01:04:32.189
somebody else would call you,
wouldn't they?

01:04:32.266 --> 01:04:34.860
I got into a bit of a scrape,
but no big deal.

01:04:34.902 --> 01:04:36.893
I'm just calling
so you won't worry.

01:04:36.938 --> 01:04:38.235
I'll be home soon.

01:04:38.272 --> 01:04:40.263
I'll, uh...

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:43.038
I'll be home as soon as I can.

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:45.774
I love you, too. Bye.

01:04:48.249 --> 01:04:52.015
I hope you know what
you're doing, busting a Fed.

01:04:52.053 --> 01:04:54.055
Let me worry about that.

01:04:54.055 --> 01:04:55.613
How's the arm?

01:04:55.656 --> 01:04:57.749
Hey, it's a scratch.

01:04:57.792 --> 01:04:59.817
What the hell's this,
your press secretary?

01:04:59.861 --> 01:05:02.263
This is the stuff
I got from Lloyd...

01:05:02.263 --> 01:05:03.821
firearms, personal I. D...

01:05:03.865 --> 01:05:05.856
and who in the hell
knows what this is?

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.664
Must be some kind
of special FBI toy.

01:05:08.703 --> 01:05:09.897
Drop it off at the lab.

01:05:09.937 --> 01:05:11.234
We'll see what they can
figure out in the morning.

01:05:11.272 --> 01:05:13.069
Gotcha. No problem.

01:05:14.609 --> 01:05:15.735
Thanks, partner.

01:05:15.776 --> 01:05:17.300
Take care of that arm.

01:05:18.346 --> 01:05:20.337
I got that information
you wanted.

01:05:24.018 --> 01:05:26.043
Seattle FBI
says Agent Lloyd Gallagher...

01:05:26.087 --> 01:05:28.021
was killed in a forest fire
about a month ago...

01:05:28.055 --> 01:05:31.058
with a friend of his
named Stone, Robert Stone.

01:05:31.058 --> 01:05:33.219
They were hunting
in Olympic National Forest...

01:05:33.261 --> 01:05:35.229
the weekend
they had that big forest fire.

01:05:35.263 --> 01:05:38.266
Bureau figured Stone was dead.
Never found his body.

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:40.325
Just figured it burned up
in the fire.

01:05:42.803 --> 01:05:43.963
Is that all?

01:05:46.774 --> 01:05:49.265
I had them wire me
a picture of Stone.

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:50.834
Evidently, Mr. Stone...

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:53.870
has taken over the identity
of his dead friend.

01:06:03.324 --> 01:06:06.191
If you don't need me,
I'm going home.

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:09.753
Brem?

01:06:09.797 --> 01:06:11.196
Good work.

01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:10.149
Excuse me, Sarge.
Where do you want him?

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.855
Take the cuffs off him.

01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:24.571
You want me to stay?

01:07:33.014 --> 01:07:34.106
Crazy thing.

01:07:34.148 --> 01:07:36.582
I was starting to like you.

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.016
Sit down.

01:07:49.063 --> 01:07:53.022
I checked with the FBI
in Seattle.

01:07:53.067 --> 01:07:56.059
Lloyd Gallagher is dead.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:08:01.096
Your real name is Robert Stone.

01:08:01.142 --> 01:08:03.337
That's about all
we know about you...

01:08:03.377 --> 01:08:04.810
except for the fact...

01:08:04.845 --> 01:08:06.676
that you're driving
a stolen Porsche...

01:08:06.714 --> 01:08:08.739
which is probably
the only true thing...

01:08:08.783 --> 01:08:10.751
that you've told us so far.

01:08:14.221 --> 01:08:17.212
So why don't we just
have a little talk?

01:08:17.258 --> 01:08:19.852
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

01:08:19.894 --> 01:08:21.020
Please don't ask me that.

01:08:21.062 --> 01:08:23.029
Don't give me that!
I've had it with you.

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:25.055
You think this
is some kind of a game?

01:08:25.099 --> 01:08:26.657
You think you can waltz
into this town...

01:08:26.701 --> 01:08:28.100
turn my department
upside-down...

01:08:28.135 --> 01:08:29.693
endanger my men's lives?

01:08:29.737 --> 01:08:32.103
I'm tired of you
jerking me around.

01:08:32.139 --> 01:08:33.332
I want answers!

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:34.906
Why does it take
fifteen shots...

01:08:34.942 --> 01:08:36.533
to take down
some zoned-out stripper?

01:08:36.577 --> 01:08:39.011
Why do three
law-abiding citizens...

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:41.537
go crazy
and start killing people?

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:44.915
I want answers,
and I want them now!

01:08:46.353 --> 01:08:51.154
Miller, the stripper,
DeVries were the same...

01:08:51.192 --> 01:08:53.160
and it's not human.

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:55.752
Excuse me?

01:08:58.198 --> 01:09:01.167
I've been after it
for a long time.

01:09:01.202 --> 01:09:05.263
Now it's here,
on Earth, in your city.

01:09:05.305 --> 01:09:07.035
Oh, boy.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.912
Are we talking spacemen here?

01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:17.073
The way it works is
it finds a body...

01:09:17.151 --> 01:09:20.211
gets inside,
uses it to move around.

01:09:20.254 --> 01:09:23.223
It stays in that body
until the body is so damaged...

01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:24.986
it has to find another body.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:26.959
That's the only time
I can kill it...

01:09:26.993 --> 01:09:28.221
when it's between bodies.

01:09:28.261 --> 01:09:31.026
I missed my chance when it came
out of the stripper.

01:09:31.064 --> 01:09:33.828
It found another body
and changed before I got there.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:36.234
So now we don't know
who the spaceman is.

01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:40.064
But I don't have to look
for it anymore.

01:09:40.107 --> 01:09:42.667
It knows I'm here.
It'll come after me.

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:44.678
Beck, I need my weapon.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.578
That's the only thing
that can kill it.

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:53.915
So the spaceman is the one...

01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:56.013
that killed your partner,
your wife...

01:09:56.056 --> 01:09:58.854
the one that you've been
tracking for the past...

01:09:58.893 --> 01:09:59.985
Nine years.

01:10:00.027 --> 01:10:01.119
Nine years.

01:10:01.162 --> 01:10:02.288
Your time.

01:10:03.864 --> 01:10:06.025
Our time.

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:12.065
I guess
a career in the police...

01:10:12.106 --> 01:10:14.768
didn't really prepare you
for this, did it?

01:10:16.944 --> 01:10:18.605
Yes, it did.

01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:23.179
We'll try again later.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.307
It's OK.

01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:20.137
Good morning, Lieutenant.

01:11:20.174 --> 01:11:21.801
Morning.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.036
What's eating him?

01:11:23.077 --> 01:11:26.808
I thought you said
he wasn't coming in today.

01:11:41.295 --> 01:11:43.195
Hey, John, what do you say?

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.959
I thought you weren't
coming in today.

01:11:44.999 --> 01:11:47.866
I have work to do.

01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:49.927
I'm sorry.
This is Lieutenant Masterson.

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:52.302
Carol Miller,
Senator Holt's assistant.

01:11:52.339 --> 01:11:53.772
Agents Stadt and Lowe.

01:11:53.807 --> 01:11:56.401
They're handling security
for the senator's speech today.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:58.942
Holt.
The one everyone applauds.

01:11:58.979 --> 01:12:00.913
We'd like to think so.

01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:03.213
Where's the speech?

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.218
Park Plaza.
You know that.

01:12:06.186 --> 01:12:07.278
Yeah, five.

01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:10.290
Five guys in the lobby,
I think, Carol.

01:12:10.324 --> 01:12:12.315
Take it easy, all right?

01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:13.924
Sure. I'll be fine.

01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:15.258
How are you doing, Sarge?

01:12:15.296 --> 01:12:16.786
Hey, Frankie, how you doing?

01:12:57.671 --> 01:12:59.036
That was a bomb!

01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:01.098
Where did that come from?

01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:03.632
We've got an explosion
in ballistics.

01:13:03.677 --> 01:13:05.611
Just sit down here.

01:13:06.714 --> 01:13:08.272
There's smoke
through the corridor.

01:13:08.315 --> 01:13:10.180
Get a fire unit over here.

01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:16.790
Get a fire extinguisher in here.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.888
Was it a bomb?

01:13:20.928 --> 01:13:22.657
Get him out of here!

01:13:22.696 --> 01:13:23.856
What happened?

01:13:33.807 --> 01:13:36.776
What the hell is going on?

01:13:36.844 --> 01:13:38.812
Hey, what's going on here?

01:13:38.846 --> 01:13:39.938
You!

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.743
You?
Lieutenant, what's going on?

01:13:41.782 --> 01:13:43.306
Where is the other one?

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:44.612
What other one?

01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:46.084
The one you were with.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.247
I locked him up.
You know that.

01:13:48.288 --> 01:13:49.585
I want to talk to him.

01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:50.715
What is this?

01:13:50.758 --> 01:13:53.727
Listen.
I already shot you once.

01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:56.252
I can hardly wait
to do it again.

01:13:56.296 --> 01:13:57.627
Now, let's go.

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:04.963
Stay back.

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:06.973
Lieutenant, what's going on?

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.099
Get back!

01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:09.336
Take cover!

01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:13.236
Tom, you OK?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.874
Stay back, Cliff,
it's not Masterson.

01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:18.846
Seal this corridor off!

01:14:18.886 --> 01:14:20.285
Get him out of here!

01:14:28.996 --> 01:14:30.293
Now, Beck!

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.693
Freeze!

01:14:43.343 --> 01:14:45.243
We just dumped the lieutenant.

01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:47.110
Get an ambulance.

01:14:49.216 --> 01:14:51.650
Sanchez, stay away from him.

01:14:57.858 --> 01:14:59.120
Brooks!

01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:01.150
Give me your gun.

01:15:01.195 --> 01:15:02.685
Give me your fucking gun!

01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:04.788
It's in my waistband, man!

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:08.233
Get a shotgun
and seal off the stairwell.

01:15:12.039 --> 01:15:13.607
Open the gate!
Gate into C-eight!

01:15:13.607 --> 01:15:14.869
What the hell's going on here?

01:15:14.908 --> 01:15:16.899
Just open...
Masterson has flipped out...

01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:18.571
and he's shooting up
the station, all right?

01:15:18.645 --> 01:15:19.771
Check your piece, Beck.

01:15:21.648 --> 01:15:22.876
Give me the keys, Joe.

01:15:28.021 --> 01:15:29.283
Buzz the gate, Joe.

01:15:30.657 --> 01:15:32.887
Buzz the fucking gate!

01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:40.033
And watch out for Masterson!

01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:46.072
Hey, I need a phone call.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.277
I just saw Masterson
dump two cops.

01:15:56.316 --> 01:15:59.219
He took six hits
at point-blank range...

01:15:59.219 --> 01:16:01.881
and he's not going down.

01:16:01.922 --> 01:16:03.787
Is Masterson...

01:16:05.592 --> 01:16:06.820
Is he dead?

01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:08.988
The real Masterson.

01:16:22.876 --> 01:16:25.106
You're going to need this.

01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:28.978
Hey, what's going on?

01:16:31.718 --> 01:16:33.652
Jesus Christ.

01:16:33.687 --> 01:16:34.984
Let me in.

01:16:35.022 --> 01:16:36.649
I can't do that, Lieutenant.

01:16:36.723 --> 01:16:38.987
Hey, put that down.
Don't do that.

01:16:39.026 --> 01:16:40.687
Get down.

01:16:57.744 --> 01:16:59.006
You're hit. Here.

01:16:59.046 --> 01:17:00.240
I know.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.145
Alhague.

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:07.013
Before I kill you, I'm curious.

01:17:07.054 --> 01:17:08.248
How did you find me?

01:17:08.288 --> 01:17:11.621
You left an angry partner
for dead on Altair.

01:17:11.658 --> 01:17:13.626
A mistake.

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.025
That's what it said.

01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:19.728
Die, you fucker!

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:21.165
Son of a bitch!

01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:23.567
Why don't you use
that goddamn thing?

01:17:23.604 --> 01:17:24.696
Not yet.

01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:26.568
You said it's the only thing
that kills him.

01:17:26.607 --> 01:17:27.941
It's not that simple.

01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:31.138
Alhague,
how do you like being human?

01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:35.977
It's all right.

01:17:36.016 --> 01:17:38.109
Better than being Altairian.

01:17:38.151 --> 01:17:41.814
Altairians are a filthy people.

01:17:41.855 --> 01:17:45.552
We could take over this place
if we wanted.

01:17:45.592 --> 01:17:48.026
They have nothing here
to stop us.

01:17:48.061 --> 01:17:50.291
Yo, hippy,
what kind of dude are you?

01:18:02.909 --> 01:18:04.877
OK, what's going on, man?

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:11.050
Die!

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:38.302
He's going to change soon.

01:18:38.345 --> 01:18:40.176
I'm going to be there.

01:18:41.815 --> 01:18:43.146
Who the hell are you?

01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:45.843
Do you feel pain?

01:18:45.886 --> 01:18:46.978
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.181
Why didn't you use that thing?

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:51.588
You said it's the only thing
that would kill him.

01:18:55.896 --> 01:18:57.727
Wrong composition.

01:18:58.732 --> 01:19:00.359
Doesn't work on human flesh.

01:19:20.821 --> 01:19:23.790
Hey, open up the door, man.

01:19:23.824 --> 01:19:26.622
He's from outer space.

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.151
Nobody knows it. It's crazy.

01:19:29.196 --> 01:19:30.720
Something's going on.

01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:36.065
Dude's from outer space.

01:19:54.755 --> 01:19:56.245
Seal this off.

01:19:56.289 --> 01:19:58.553
Get back in there.

01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.082
Back.

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:04.854
Cover me.

01:20:04.898 --> 01:20:06.297
You go low.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.858
On three.

01:20:08.902 --> 01:20:11.996
One... two... three.

01:20:12.038 --> 01:20:13.733
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

01:20:13.774 --> 01:20:15.173
Don't move!

01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:16.334
Freeze!

01:20:18.145 --> 01:20:19.806
- Is it him?
- No.

01:20:19.846 --> 01:20:21.336
Beck, what's going on?

01:20:23.183 --> 01:20:25.242
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

01:20:25.285 --> 01:20:26.946
What's the hell is going on?

01:20:26.987 --> 01:20:28.921
Did anybody leave this room?

01:20:28.955 --> 01:20:30.650
I don't know.

01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:33.887
Willis. He said
he was going to get a medic.

01:20:33.927 --> 01:20:36.327
Beck, who did this to Masterson?

01:20:36.363 --> 01:20:39.890
- Not Willis.
- I'm sorry.

01:20:39.933 --> 01:20:41.924
I think we better find him.

01:20:56.383 --> 01:20:57.714
Senator Holt.

01:21:09.729 --> 01:21:12.095
What about
the Admiral Gray appointment?

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:18.934
Where?

01:21:22.809 --> 01:21:24.242
Jesus Christ.

01:21:31.384 --> 01:21:34.217
And the free lunch program...

01:21:49.135 --> 01:21:51.365
Freeze!
Don't move!

01:21:51.404 --> 01:21:52.928
Hold it right there.

01:21:52.973 --> 01:21:54.065
Beck. LAPD.

01:21:54.107 --> 01:21:55.734
Who the hell's he?

01:21:55.775 --> 01:21:56.901
Gallagher. FBI.

01:21:56.943 --> 01:21:58.410
It's OK.
He's one of mine.

01:21:58.612 --> 01:21:59.704
What are you doing?

01:21:59.746 --> 01:22:01.047
Code red. Code red.

01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:03.277
Sir, there may be an assassin.

01:22:03.316 --> 01:22:05.614
We'll take you
out the back entrance.

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:10.588
Detective Willis...

01:22:10.624 --> 01:22:12.888
I've got orders
to disarm and detain you.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.257
Sure.

01:22:25.038 --> 01:22:26.630
Get out of here now!

01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:32.777
All right. In here!
Move it! Move!

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.873
Back against the wall now.

01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:49.790
Freeze!

01:23:54.828 --> 01:23:56.261
Oh, shit.

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:24.022
They're in the kitchen.

01:24:26.559 --> 01:24:28.083
Shit.

01:24:28.128 --> 01:24:31.097
Jim, stay with Beck.
Charlie, go with me.

01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:33.099
Three-L-ten, requesting
medical attention.

01:24:33.133 --> 01:24:34.600
I got two downed officers here.

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:38.567
Freeze! Drop it!

01:24:42.142 --> 01:24:44.235
Both of you in the closet, now!

01:24:56.623 --> 01:24:58.591
Who are you?

01:25:00.994 --> 01:25:02.928
Who are you, God damn it?

01:25:05.298 --> 01:25:06.731
What do you want?

01:25:21.247 --> 01:25:24.216
Let's get the senator
out of here.

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:25.774
All right.
Everybody move.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:26.911
Get him out of here.

01:25:26.953 --> 01:25:28.079
Watch that guy.

01:25:42.035 --> 01:25:43.832
Uniform, seal this off.

01:26:04.023 --> 01:26:06.218
Hey, you can't go through here.

01:26:17.203 --> 01:26:18.932
Did we get him?

01:26:27.614 --> 01:26:29.104
Question.

01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:32.277
Was any motive established
for why Detective Willis...

01:26:32.318 --> 01:26:34.650
would want to assassinate
Senator Holt?

01:26:34.687 --> 01:26:35.847
Lieutenant Flynn?

01:26:37.223 --> 01:26:38.656
The depart...

01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:42.252
the department is conducting
an investigation...

01:26:42.295 --> 01:26:44.991
but at this time
we have no motive.

01:26:45.031 --> 01:26:46.599
Question.

01:26:46.599 --> 01:26:47.725
Yes, sir.

01:26:47.767 --> 01:26:51.294
Senator, do you still intend
to run for president?

01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:53.669
The senator will discuss
his campaign plans...

01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:55.196
after he has had
adequate time...

01:26:55.241 --> 01:26:57.300
to fully reflect
on the situation.

01:26:57.343 --> 01:26:59.174
I want to be president.

01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:00.338
What's that, Senator?

01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:06.818
I want to be president.

01:27:28.942 --> 01:27:30.034
Gallagher. FBI.

01:27:30.076 --> 01:27:32.544
Mm-hmm.
What's in the bag?

01:27:32.579 --> 01:27:34.240
Security equipment.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.941
Open it up.

01:27:39.219 --> 01:27:40.811
All right. Go!

01:27:45.058 --> 01:27:47.083
Freeze!
Hold it! Freeze!

01:28:44.584 --> 01:28:46.108
Look!

01:29:50.683 --> 01:29:55.211
Mommy, is Daddy
going to be all right?

01:29:57.557 --> 01:30:00.253
You know, your daddy
loves you very much.

01:31:26.345 --> 01:31:28.905
Mom, take her
out of here, please.

01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:32.777
Nurse!

01:31:33.786 --> 01:31:36.346
Get a gurney.
Get an orderly. Stat!
