00:02.530 --> 00:03.620
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:03.820 --> 00:04.920
I got a transfer out
of Drug Enforcement,

00:05.120 --> 00:06.350
and out of
undercover work.

00:06.550 --> 00:07.820
That's actually
really great news.

00:08.020 --> 00:08.820
Mm.
(chuckles)

00:09.020 --> 00:11.020
Tamika?
Hey, Marvin?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.360
I guess if we were
to try it again,

00:12.560 --> 00:13.690
we'd probably screw it up
again, wouldn't we?

00:13.890 --> 00:15.290
Probably.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.330
Not a reason
not to give it a try.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.600
It's my shield.
I'm gonna give it to Tamika.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.670
Must mean things are going
pretty good between you and her.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.340
Mr. Azeroff, I don't think
I can accompany you

00:24.540 --> 00:26.170
to Dubai this weekend.
I mean, I wish I could.

00:26.370 --> 00:27.410
I mean, God knows
I need the money.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.880
$10,000 here.
Just like that?

00:30.080 --> 00:31.560
Just like that.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.310
Heard you're having
money problems.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.520
My dad went in
for his six-month checkup.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.880
His numbers are bad.
I'm sorry.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.720
I feel so alone, Tommy.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.160
You're not alone.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.120
It may feel
that way, but...

00:44.320 --> 00:45.320
you're not.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.610
* *

00:51.150 --> 00:53.130
* I've been living
on your shore *

00:53.330 --> 00:54.500
* Living on your water *

00:54.700 --> 00:57.270
* Living on
your waterfalls, babe *

00:57.470 --> 00:59.660
* *

01:00.420 --> 01:01.440
* I've been living
on your shore *

01:01.640 --> 01:02.610
* Living on your water *

01:02.810 --> 01:03.810
* Living on your waterfalls *

01:04.010 --> 01:04.840
* Babe. *
Ooh, a sound bath.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.030
Wow.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.680
Canyon Ranch?
That's back on?

01:08.880 --> 01:09.950
No, that is not back on--

01:10.150 --> 01:13.550
A weekend there
runs like $10,000.

01:13.750 --> 01:14.890
I told you I got it covered.

01:15.090 --> 01:15.890
You can't afford it.

01:16.090 --> 01:18.160
Excuse me?
How do you know?

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
'Cause I know how much you make

01:19.560 --> 01:21.030
like how you know
how much I make.

01:21.230 --> 01:22.430
You know what?

01:22.630 --> 01:24.900
I don't think I like
that you're the grownup

01:25.100 --> 01:26.200
in this relationship.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.470
Oh, feel free to relieve
me of the responsibility

01:29.670 --> 01:31.800
any time you want.
Hmm...

01:32.000 --> 01:32.940
TouchÃ©.

01:33.140 --> 01:34.810
Let me start
by not being late to work.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.110
Okay.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.880
I'm gonna see
you tonight?

01:38.080 --> 01:39.350
(exhales softly)

01:39.550 --> 01:41.310
I have one change
of clothes left,

01:41.510 --> 01:43.880
and it's in your room
on your chair.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.620
Well, I'm not giving you
a dresser drawer of your own,

01:46.820 --> 01:48.420
if that's what
you're hinting at.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.460
Too much commitment, huh?
Way too much.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.840
Way too...
(chuckles softly)

01:54.840 --> 01:56.880
* *

01:57.850 --> 01:58.900
Mm.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.420
Girl.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.770
Oof. Man, oh, man.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.150
(door closes)

02:07.920 --> 02:10.310
AZEROFF:
You hunt?
KILLIAN:
Uh, no.

02:10.510 --> 02:13.250
I'm supposed to go to
Pakistan next month.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.860
Hunt with falcons.

02:15.930 --> 02:16.980
That right?

02:17.180 --> 02:19.590
They go after these birds
called bustards.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.650
Let me tell you, when
they dive-bomb one of them,

02:21.850 --> 02:23.260
it is not a pretty picture.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.770
(chuckles softly)

02:25.570 --> 02:26.730
AZEROFF:
Remember what I told you.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.440
I know.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.830
Hey, sorry, folks,

02:31.030 --> 02:32.830
we got a COVID
situation in here.

02:33.030 --> 02:34.430
I'm gonna have to ask you
to take the next one.

02:34.630 --> 02:35.850
Okay? (mouthing)

02:39.260 --> 02:41.110
(clears throat)

02:41.310 --> 02:42.910
* *

02:43.110 --> 02:45.110
I hate demonstrating
privilege like that.

02:45.310 --> 02:47.810
It's not like you want
to inconvenience anyone.
Nah.

02:48.010 --> 02:49.180
I mean, what's the alternative,
you know?

02:49.380 --> 02:50.550
I got to pack into an elevator

02:50.750 --> 02:52.050
with a bunch of people
I don't even know?

02:52.250 --> 02:54.670
Ah, they take the next one.
No big thing.
Yeah.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.090
CLERK:
<i>The People v. Isaac Jones,</i>
Your Honor.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.630
This is the third time that
Mr. Jones has been arrested

03:03.830 --> 03:05.200
this calendar year.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.630
That right,
Mr. Nessen?

03:06.830 --> 03:07.970
Sorry, Your Honor,
I haven't had a chance to

03:08.170 --> 03:10.000
familiarize myself
with Mr. Jones's record.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.040
I'm set to be in for
the assigned public defender

03:12.240 --> 03:13.070
who's out sick.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.440
Uh, may I speak, Your Honor?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.820
Go ahead.

03:17.190 --> 03:19.250
Um... (clears throat)

03:19.450 --> 03:20.580
One of those times I take

03:20.780 --> 03:22.320
complete and total
responsibility for.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.650
The other was just

03:23.850 --> 03:25.650
wrong-place wrong-time
type situation,

03:25.850 --> 03:28.320
which is no excuse
and I deeply regret.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.860
Your Honor,

03:30.060 --> 03:31.760
both of these arrests were
brought on by Mr. Jones

03:31.960 --> 03:33.730
being physically abusive
to his girlfriend.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.790
As we will hear
from Detective Morales,

03:35.990 --> 03:38.100
who made the third arrest,
Mr. Jones's girlfriend

03:38.300 --> 03:39.300
required hospitalization.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.100
Accordingly,
we ask that bail be set

03:41.300 --> 03:43.770
in the amount of
$100,000.
That to make a point?

03:43.970 --> 03:45.400
No.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.690
It's to increase the odds he'll
show up for his court date.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.940
He has ties
in the community, a job...

03:52.140 --> 03:54.010
and I don't believe
he represents a flight risk.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.650
And because I don't believe
in incarcerating people

03:56.850 --> 03:58.450
based on their bank accounts,

03:58.650 --> 04:00.450
I'm releasing him
on his own recognizance.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.620
Move for a protective order
for Mr. Jones's girlfriend,

04:02.820 --> 04:03.920
Chantal Leopold.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.960
I'll give you that.
Motion granted.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.830
We ain't even together
no more, Your Honor.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.630
She go her way, I go mine.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.160
Protective order stands.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.370
(bangs gavel)

04:13.570 --> 04:16.120
(gallery murmuring)

04:18.250 --> 04:20.810
Diane,
how do you stand it?
How do you stand it?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.340
You're the one
that arrests them.

04:22.540 --> 04:23.880
I don't have to listen
to somebody argue

04:24.080 --> 04:25.980
they should be let go.
Hey, lady prosecutor.

04:26.180 --> 04:29.750
Chantal say she want
a protective order?
Take a hike, Isaac.

04:29.950 --> 04:31.280
How come you didn't ask
for a protective order

04:31.480 --> 04:32.550
for your own damn self?

04:32.750 --> 04:33.890
Is that a threat?
I wasn't talking to you.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.390
I don't care if you were
talking to me or not.

04:35.590 --> 04:36.490
You threaten an ADA,

04:36.690 --> 04:38.310
I'll lock your ass up
right now.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.280
(exhales)

04:48.080 --> 04:50.370
(exhales)
Real charmer, isn't he?

04:50.570 --> 04:51.890
And he's single.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.020
* *

05:01.760 --> 05:03.380
(siren whoops)

05:03.580 --> 05:05.300
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:07.540 --> 05:09.390
(indistinct chatter)

05:09.590 --> 05:11.290
MORALES:
Oh, my God.

05:11.490 --> 05:12.880
Diane.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.970
What are we thinking?
SANDEFORD:
Diane Gould.

05:22.170 --> 05:24.240
Last seen leaving
the Brooklyn DA's office

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
about 8:00 p.m.
last night.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.020
Crystal knew her.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.810
I'm sorry.

05:31.010 --> 05:33.410
One of her cases,
a guy I collared,

05:33.610 --> 05:35.180
had a court appearance
yesterday.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.120
Judge released him

05:37.320 --> 05:38.550
pending trial,

05:38.750 --> 05:42.050
granted a protective order
for his ex-girlfriend.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.860
The defendant came right up
to the line of threatening Diane

05:47.060 --> 05:48.530
outside the courtroom.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.810
You know where we can find him?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.330
Witnesses?

05:53.530 --> 05:54.430
None so far.

05:54.630 --> 05:55.630
What do we know about her?

05:55.830 --> 05:56.940
MORALES:
Tough.

05:57.140 --> 05:58.200
Funny.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.940
I knew her
when I was in Street Crime.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.610
Anything about her
personal life we can go on?

06:02.810 --> 06:05.710
From what I knew,
she didn't have a personal life.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.000
Mostly, she worked.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.020
SUAREZ:
ADA Wexler.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.950
Hey, Chief.
We're, uh, all very sorry
for your loss, Paul.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.720
Thanks for saying that, John.
I appreciate it.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.220
I-- You know, as prosecutors,
we're used to...

06:19.420 --> 06:21.260
dealing with
other people's tragedies,

06:21.460 --> 06:23.000
but this one...

06:23.200 --> 06:24.760
One of ours.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.770
One of ours, as well.

06:26.970 --> 06:27.930
AIDE:
Sir?

06:28.130 --> 06:30.050
Thank you. Excuse me.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.770
Yeah. (groans)

06:33.970 --> 06:35.470
We need to get this one
solved fast.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.860
* *

06:51.270 --> 06:52.930
* *

06:53.130 --> 06:53.990
ISAAC:
<i>So...</i>

06:54.190 --> 06:55.490
what's that mean, huh?

06:55.690 --> 06:56.900
"Person of interest"?

06:57.100 --> 07:00.300
It means your exchange
with ADA Gould yesterday

07:00.500 --> 07:01.870
makes it
necessary for us to

07:02.070 --> 07:05.670
inquire as to your whereabouts
for the past 24 hours.

07:05.870 --> 07:07.010
'Cause a Black man
standing up for himself

07:07.210 --> 07:08.390
got to be guilty, right?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.530
'Cause ADA Gould is dead.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.420
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.290
MORALES:
Nobody said you did.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.630
We know you were in court
yesterday morning.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.730
Where'd you go
after that?
I went to work.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.060
Look, I swear to God I didn't
have nothing to do with it.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.330
Where you work?

07:32.530 --> 07:34.500
A warehouse.
Secaucus, New Jersey.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.550
13516 Aviation
Boulevard.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.540
WEXLER: <i>I don't need</i>
<i>to tell you all</i>

07:40.740 --> 07:43.410
that the sooner an arrest can be
made on this case, the better.

07:43.610 --> 07:45.140
Which is usually the case.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.650
WEXLER: Not like this.
This case goes

07:46.850 --> 07:48.350
to the heart of the system.
(knock at door)

07:48.550 --> 07:50.320
Yeah?
KILLIAN:
Uh...

07:50.520 --> 07:51.850
Isaac Jones's alibi
checks out.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.620
His boss confirms
he was working

07:53.820 --> 07:55.150
in Jersey
till 9:00 at night.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.960
ME puts time of death
at between 9:30 and 10:00.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.290
We'll need to go through
all of Diane's cases,

08:00.490 --> 08:01.760
past and present.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.060
Sarah in my office will give you
whatever you need.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.400
We'll also be canvassing

08:05.600 --> 08:06.930
whatever neighborhoods
she frequented.

08:07.130 --> 08:09.130
WEXLER: Whatever overtime
you need approved,

08:09.330 --> 08:11.640
whatever anything you need,

08:11.840 --> 08:13.940
if you are not getting it,
please tell me.

08:14.140 --> 08:16.270
I'll march straight
into the PC's office

08:16.470 --> 08:18.110
and make sure that you get it.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.980
The killing of an ADA is
a high enough priority,

08:21.180 --> 08:24.020
so I don't think we'll have
a problem, but... yeah.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.420
* Three, two, one, oh *

08:25.620 --> 08:26.920
* Yeah, I'm trained to go *

08:27.120 --> 08:29.290
* Yeah, I'm trained to go,
ready to work *

08:29.490 --> 08:30.660
* So what you playing for? *

08:30.860 --> 08:32.420
* You all talk and no show *

08:32.630 --> 08:34.060
* I'm always trained to go *

08:34.260 --> 08:35.430
* Trained to go. *

08:35.630 --> 08:37.260
You ever deal with
this ADA? Diane Gould?

08:37.460 --> 08:38.660
No, never did.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.100
It's pretty unusual
for a prosecutor

08:40.300 --> 08:41.570
to get murdered,
isn't it?
Well, it happens.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.100
I'd be asking
what she was doing

08:43.300 --> 08:44.670
in that particularly
desolate area.

08:44.870 --> 08:46.200
She went for a run?
Possibly.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.740
Or was she meeting someone?
Or did she have a secret life?

08:49.940 --> 08:52.140
A secret life?
What kind of secret life?

08:52.340 --> 08:53.680
Kind you keep secret.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.610
See, the detectives'll
talk to people who knew her,

08:55.810 --> 08:57.320
maybe people who
grew up with her.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.550
They'll go through
where she lived,

08:58.750 --> 09:00.390
go through her lockers,
if she had any,

09:00.590 --> 09:03.820
check her phone, bills,
her credit card statements.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.590
See, that's the thing
about getting murdered--

09:06.790 --> 09:09.630
whatever you kept secret
is going to get found out.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.010
Truth.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.850
* *

09:17.790 --> 09:19.910
This is what
she wore to court.

09:20.110 --> 09:21.960
Suits and heels.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.780
It's hard to think of her

09:24.980 --> 09:26.710
picking all this stuff
out and...

09:26.910 --> 09:28.780
now it's just gonna
get boxed up and given away.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.520
KILLIAN:
Yeah, well,
you hate to think

09:30.720 --> 09:31.520
you hate to think it was
one of those court appearances

09:31.720 --> 09:32.950
that got her killed.

09:33.150 --> 09:34.420
Is it better to think
she caught the eye of

09:34.620 --> 09:37.390
some sick bastard
when she went for a run?

09:37.590 --> 09:38.820
KILLIAN: (sighs)
I don't know.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.090
Here.

09:40.290 --> 09:41.530
I don't know
which is better.

09:41.730 --> 09:43.860
You know, we were the same age.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.460
We both wanted to get
into law enforcement.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.270
She went to law school,

09:48.470 --> 09:50.370
and I went
to the police academy.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.400
Yeah? You didn't know her
from back then?
MORALES: No.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.310
But I spent a fair amount
of time with her

09:55.510 --> 09:57.040
preparing for her trials.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.040
Yeah.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.310
Any idea of what
we're expecting to find in here?

10:01.510 --> 10:03.650
I don't know, Tommy. Uh...

10:03.850 --> 10:06.050
Something from one of
her past cases, maybe.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.700
Yeah.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.160
Hey. (whistles)

10:10.360 --> 10:12.810
What are you doing?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.360
QUINLAN:
I noticed the bottom of
this lamp looks weird.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.130
And I found this.

10:18.330 --> 10:19.460
It's a listening device.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.140
Why would there be
a listening device here?

10:23.340 --> 10:25.520
* *

10:30.030 --> 10:31.940
Do you have a theory as to
Diane Gould's secret life?

10:32.140 --> 10:33.910
SANDEFORD:
I'll leave that
to the detectives.

10:34.110 --> 10:36.880
You ever want to be one?
No, I never did.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.220
I think you probably
would've been good at it.

10:39.420 --> 10:40.990
Everything
with detectives

10:41.190 --> 10:42.660
is after the fact.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.220
The crime's been committed.

10:44.420 --> 10:45.590
They come along,
try to figure out

10:45.790 --> 10:46.960
who's lying
and who's telling the truth.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.830
Now, I like to be
in the midst of things

10:49.030 --> 10:50.860
before anyone has
had the chance

10:51.060 --> 10:52.530
to figure out what lie
they gonna tell.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.380
So it's not the uniform?

10:55.180 --> 10:57.300
I happen to love the way
I look in a uniform.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.640
(chuckling):
You know. Look here.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.510
It's a good look.
(chuckles)

11:00.710 --> 11:02.810
I knew I would
catch you here.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.940
How you doing, Andre?
I'm good, Tamika.
How you doing?

11:05.140 --> 11:06.140
SANDEFORD:
Is everything all right?

11:06.340 --> 11:08.210
It was Briermere.

11:08.410 --> 11:09.610
What was Briermere?

11:09.820 --> 11:11.780
The farm stand where
we got the pie that time.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.090
I was racking my brain
for the name of it.

11:14.290 --> 11:15.320
Sit down and join us.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.620
No, I'm due over
at the food pantry.

11:16.820 --> 11:17.890
So you come all the way
over here to tell me

11:18.090 --> 11:19.890
the name of the farm stand
was Briermere?

11:20.090 --> 11:21.540
That's right.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.130
That's right.

11:24.330 --> 11:27.250
This woman.
(chuckling)

11:32.020 --> 11:33.660
Babe...

11:35.920 --> 11:39.160
("Dibujos De Mi Alma"
by Y La Bamba playing)

11:47.640 --> 11:49.670
Baby.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.540
(clears throat softly)

12:03.190 --> 12:05.950
You know, I never asked
you how she liked the...

12:07.120 --> 12:08.340
...the miniature
shield you got her.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.480
She liked it a lot.
She, uh...

12:10.680 --> 12:11.780
She teared up.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.950
She teared up
when I gave it to her.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.650
BENTLEY:
You got a good one
there, Marvin.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.570
I know it. I just...

12:19.100 --> 12:20.520
I just asked her to marry me.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.300
* *

12:30.280 --> 12:31.700
* I'm tired *

12:31.900 --> 12:33.030
* And broken *

12:33.230 --> 12:34.370
* But I was *

12:34.570 --> 12:36.430
* Still hoping... *
Taylor...

12:36.630 --> 12:37.670
Yeah.
...find out when
they're gonna fix

12:37.870 --> 12:39.570
the leaking pipe
under the dish pit,

12:39.770 --> 12:41.340
and tell them the floor there's
always soaking wet.

12:41.540 --> 12:42.940
Okay.
KILLIAN:
Hey.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.180
CORINNE:
Hey.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.010
I got to get over
to the hospital.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.650
Is everything all right?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.680
My father gets chemo today
and I've got to sort

12:49.880 --> 12:51.450
some things out
with his insurance.

12:51.650 --> 12:53.420
Called a car, but they said
it would be 15 minutes

12:53.620 --> 12:55.190
and then that one canceled,

12:55.390 --> 12:57.620
so now they have
to find me another one.
Come on, I'll take you.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.090
No, you're working.
Come on, I got you here.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.840
Grab your phone.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.400
(knock at door)
Captain?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.070
YENKO:
Hey, I got something
for you on that bug

13:08.270 --> 13:09.530
you found in
Diane's apartment.

13:09.730 --> 13:11.070
You familiar with
SIM cards?

13:11.270 --> 13:14.070
Subscriber Identification
Module cards.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.470
Now, each one has
a unique pin

13:16.670 --> 13:19.240
that's used
to connect to the Internet.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.350
Now, what's interesting is
you can see a whole list of

13:22.550 --> 13:24.620
all the networks
that they connect to.

13:24.820 --> 13:28.590
This particular SIM card is
connected to a network

13:28.790 --> 13:30.590
that's associated with
a phone number

13:30.790 --> 13:33.490
belonging to a certain
Michael C. Farris,

13:33.690 --> 13:36.430
who I happen to know
is a private investigator.

13:36.630 --> 13:38.830
He used to have an office
on Court Street.

13:39.030 --> 13:40.880
He should come
pay us a visit.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.170
CORINNE:
Hey, Daddy.

13:45.370 --> 13:46.640
CHICK:
Hey, baby.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.970
Tommy just wanted to come up
and say hi, too.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.910
Oh. Hey, Tom,
how you doing?

13:51.110 --> 13:52.610
(scoffs) I'm fine.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.450
How are you doing is
the question.

13:54.650 --> 13:55.780
Well, whatever
they're putting into me

13:55.980 --> 13:57.220
is for sure taking
something out of me.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.280
That much I'll tell you.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.090
Yeah, I bet. (chuckles)

14:00.290 --> 14:01.590
This here's
a no-complaining zone,

14:01.790 --> 14:03.560
so I best not
be heard to complain.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.390
Just get
my tough-luck ticket stamped

14:05.590 --> 14:07.130
at the door.
(chuckles)

14:07.330 --> 14:09.880
(chuckles) Yeah.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.500
You know, I sh--
I should, uh, be heading back.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.570
Um, take care, Chick.

14:16.770 --> 14:19.140
Thanks for
stopping by, Tommy.
Yeah.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.520
* *

14:23.130 --> 14:25.040
MICHAEL:
I'm happy to chat
with you, Detective,

14:25.240 --> 14:26.710
but on the
issue of whether

14:26.910 --> 14:28.810
listening devices were
installed by me

14:29.010 --> 14:32.080
or on my behalf...

14:32.280 --> 14:34.250
neither confirm nor deny.

14:34.450 --> 14:35.690
Hey. What'd I miss?

14:35.890 --> 14:37.190
MORALES:
Mr. Farris was just
explaining to me

14:37.390 --> 14:39.360
that he can neither
confirm nor deny

14:39.560 --> 14:40.790
if he installed
listening devices

14:40.990 --> 14:43.000
in the home of
our murder victim.
MICHAEL: Oh.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.930
I have to preserve
my clients' confidentiality.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.100
If I'm being somewhat elusive,

14:48.300 --> 14:50.100
I have little choice
in the matter.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.340
KILLIAN: Well,
you do understand

14:51.540 --> 14:52.840
this is a homicide
investigation

14:53.040 --> 14:55.010
of an assistant
district attorney.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.440
Okay, look...

14:57.640 --> 15:00.380
I'm not gonna shirk
my responsibility here--

15:00.580 --> 15:03.350
I did install
the listening devices.

15:03.550 --> 15:05.520
We need to know
who hired you to do it.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.350
KILLIAN:
And since you're
not a lawyer,

15:07.550 --> 15:09.320
there's no lawyer-client
privilege.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.710
(chuckling)

15:13.610 --> 15:17.100
My client could've really
come forward himself.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.830
Mi client could've figured

15:19.030 --> 15:21.330
I was gonna be hauled in,
put on the spot.

15:21.530 --> 15:22.500
He could've stepped up.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.200
But they don't do that.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.310
They expect me
to take the heat.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.070
I work for
rich people.

15:29.270 --> 15:31.680
I work for
powerful people.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.550
Just when you think that
they're your friends,

15:33.750 --> 15:35.550
they make it clear as day

15:35.750 --> 15:37.500
that you're still the help.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.750
Good to know.

15:39.950 --> 15:40.890
MICHAEL:
Mm.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.520
MORALES:
Who's the client, Mr. Farris?

15:43.720 --> 15:46.640
Who hired you
to bug that apartment?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.230
I was working for
a King's County DA--

15:50.430 --> 15:51.950
Bureau Chief Paul Wexler.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.230
Mr. Wexler even
gave me the key.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.620
* *

15:58.620 --> 15:59.970
(knock at door)
Yeah?

16:00.170 --> 16:01.770
SANDEFORD: You got
a minute, Captain?
Come in.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.880
By the way,
congratulations are in order.
What, you heard?

16:05.080 --> 16:06.110
Yeah, I heard.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.410
And although I don't know
Tamika very well,

16:08.610 --> 16:10.380
I applaud you on the big move.

16:10.580 --> 16:12.380
It's a big move.
YENKO:
Big move.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.550
(chuckling) It's a move
I made 37 years ago.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.960
Anyway,
what can I do you for?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.360
Tamika wants to have
a honeymoon of some sort,

16:19.560 --> 16:21.060
and she wanted me
to come find out

16:21.260 --> 16:22.360
how many vacation days I had.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.430
Mm-hmm.

16:24.630 --> 16:25.900
You took a heavy rip this year

16:26.100 --> 16:28.100
when you went chasing after
Bentley's shooter.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.840
I did.
Mm-hmm.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.500
Time records says
I only have

16:32.700 --> 16:35.020
three vacation days
on the books.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.310
All right,
let me propose this:

16:37.510 --> 16:40.110
You commit to working
Saturdays this summer,

16:40.310 --> 16:42.950
I'll front you eight more days.
I don't expect you to

16:43.150 --> 16:44.980
go out on a limb for me,
Captain. I-I...
YENKO: No, no, no.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.180
It's no big deal.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.550
We'll do it on the DL
or the QT

16:47.750 --> 16:49.590
or whatever nomenclature
sums it up.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.060
But I get
my Saturdays covered

16:51.260 --> 16:53.140
and you get
to go away with your bride.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.080
Hey, what's the matter?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.930
When I asked her to marry me,

16:59.130 --> 17:00.700
I wanted it more than
anything in the world.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.470
Making it official,
having people

17:03.670 --> 17:06.000
stand up for me,
going on a honeymoon,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.410
at my age...

17:08.610 --> 17:10.630
I'm feeling
a little ridiculous.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.580
I feel ridiculous sometimes.

17:14.780 --> 17:17.250
The fact that
I'm learning Italian--

17:17.450 --> 17:18.750
at my age--

17:18.950 --> 17:20.690
that I still have
a stamp collection,

17:20.890 --> 17:22.720
that next month
I'm auditioning for

17:22.920 --> 17:24.990
the Police Marching Band...
(chuckling)

17:25.190 --> 17:28.860
...all of these things
make me feel ridiculous.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.710
You know what doesn't
make me feel ridiculous?

17:32.610 --> 17:34.850
The fact that
I love my wife...

17:36.050 --> 17:37.720
...and my wife loves me.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.810
So I'm gonna front you
the eight days,

17:41.010 --> 17:42.740
and you let me know
whether or not

17:42.940 --> 17:44.730
you want to go
on your honeymoon.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.350
I'm hoping
you're about to tell me

17:56.550 --> 17:59.120
you made a collar.
Unfortunately not.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.660
Do you know a Mike Farris?
Of course I know him.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.200
KILLIAN:
He said that you hired him

18:03.400 --> 18:04.830
to bug Diane Gould's apartment.

18:05.030 --> 18:06.010
Absolutely right.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.300
That's a felony.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.630
Not if you have a warrant,

18:09.830 --> 18:12.540
and since I had reason
to suspect that

18:12.740 --> 18:15.110
Diane had been compromised,
I had a warrant.

18:15.310 --> 18:16.540
Compromised how?

18:16.740 --> 18:18.510
Prosecutors have
a certain amount of

18:18.710 --> 18:20.010
discretionary authority,
Detective,

18:20.210 --> 18:22.050
but whether for
money or love,

18:22.250 --> 18:25.970
Diane might've used
her authority inappropriately.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.690
You're basing that on what?

18:28.890 --> 18:30.720
WEXLER:
A confidential
informant who,

18:30.920 --> 18:32.820
unfortunately, will have
to remain confidential.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.890
Might we be able
to listen to those recordings?

18:36.090 --> 18:37.860
First of all,
as with all investigations,

18:38.060 --> 18:39.560
it's on a need-to-know basis.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.800
We qualify as
need-to-know, Mr. Wexler.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.840
We're investigating
Ms. Gould's murder.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.500
Absolutely.
We're in agreement.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.540
Therefore, let me go through
the recordings

18:47.740 --> 18:48.740
and as soon as
I get them redacted,

18:48.940 --> 18:50.140
I will send them
right over to you.

18:50.340 --> 18:53.110
This office will do
anything in its power

18:53.310 --> 18:55.630
to help you solve this murder.
Believe me.

18:56.730 --> 18:57.780
HAYWOOD:
<i>So you have</i>

18:57.980 --> 19:00.050
a woman in your office murdered,

19:00.250 --> 19:01.590
the lead detectives
in the case ask

19:01.790 --> 19:04.260
for recordings of the
phone conversations,

19:04.460 --> 19:06.860
and you're really gonna
worry about redacting?

19:07.060 --> 19:07.960
Why?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.130
Is it 'cause of
some other case?

19:10.330 --> 19:12.760
I mean, you'd think, if you're
Wexler, there are no other cases

19:12.960 --> 19:15.220
that are more important.
KILLIAN:
Yeah.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.020
Paul Wexler's a big man
in the criminal justice system.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.940
If we move forward with
Wexler as our prime suspect,

19:25.140 --> 19:26.780
it's got to be slow
and methodical.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.280
One foot in front of the other.
No mistakes.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.750
No, you got it, boss.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.080
HAYWOOD:
I'm hoping we're
not right about this,

19:32.280 --> 19:33.920
but if we are...

19:34.120 --> 19:37.320
we only get one shot
at this guy.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.020
So let's make it count.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.210
* *

19:53.150 --> 19:55.560
* *

19:58.490 --> 19:59.580
Hey.

19:59.780 --> 20:01.580
Mr. Azeroff.
AZEROFF:
Hey, Tommy Terrific.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.110
What's doing?
KILLIAN: I was in
the neighborhood.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.920
Thought I'd drop in.
I got a question for you.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.250
When you're getting
fitted for a suit,

20:06.450 --> 20:08.150
do they have to make
a special accommodation

20:08.350 --> 20:09.990
for your,
for your gun?

20:10.190 --> 20:11.360
Oh, I don't know.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.120
I've never been
fitted for a suit.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.430
Wow. Let's let one of the
benefits of you working for me

20:15.630 --> 20:17.430
the chance to correct
that injustice.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.500
Sal'll take your measurements
when he's done with me.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.200
Yeah, yeah,
speaking of benefits, you know,

20:21.400 --> 20:23.870
one of your drivers said
you got a great health plan.

20:24.070 --> 20:26.440
Yeah. That's what
my accountant tells me.
KILLIAN: Yeah.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.810
Eh, you know, my girl's dad...
he's been paying his premiums

20:31.010 --> 20:32.380
for I don't know
how many years.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.850
Gets sick--
now, all of a sudden,

20:34.050 --> 20:35.010
they're real
particular about

20:35.210 --> 20:36.350
what treatments
they'll pay for,

20:36.550 --> 20:38.050
what treatments
they won't, you know.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.670
Bobby, what do you think?

20:42.070 --> 20:42.950
Uh, ho-ho.

20:43.150 --> 20:46.210
Heart-stoppingly beautiful.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.310
What does he think?

20:50.210 --> 20:51.300
It's, um...

20:51.500 --> 20:53.280
It's real nice.
(clucks tongue)

20:54.150 --> 20:55.070
What's his name?

20:55.270 --> 20:57.150
Um, whose name?

20:58.550 --> 21:01.070
Your girl's father.
What's his name?

21:01.270 --> 21:04.580
Oh, um,
it's Chick Moynahan.

21:04.780 --> 21:07.260
Well, leave it with Petra
on your way outside.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.180
Oh, hey...

21:09.380 --> 21:10.380
Hey, did you have
a chance to talk to

21:10.580 --> 21:12.020
that FBI friend of yours
for Darla?

21:12.220 --> 21:15.200
Yeah, I ju-- I just got
to give him a call.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.720
Give him a call.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.240
Yeah.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.860
(chuckles softly)

21:23.060 --> 21:24.300
So, what's your story?
MAN:
Hey, Farris.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.230
I don't have a story.

21:26.430 --> 21:29.370
The boss sends just you
out to pick me up?

21:29.570 --> 21:31.770
What is this,
one riot one ranger?

21:31.970 --> 21:34.710
They told me you were a
law-abiding citizen, Mr. Farris.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.240
I didn't think there was
gonna be a problem.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.790
And a problem
there was not.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.920
Come in, Mr. Farris.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.820
You can have a seat.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.290
HAYWOOD:
Thanks.

21:47.490 --> 21:49.620
Yesterday, there were just
a couple of squad detectives

21:49.820 --> 21:51.920
tending to my every need.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.690
Today, I get a deputy inspector
and a two-star chief.

21:55.890 --> 21:57.900
Sometimes nothing
conveys importance

21:58.100 --> 21:59.500
quite like collar brass.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.270
I didn't realize
I was that important.

22:01.470 --> 22:03.400
We need to hear what's
on the recordings you made

22:03.600 --> 22:04.970
in Diane Gould's apartment.

22:05.170 --> 22:08.240
I told your detectives
I turned them over to Wexler.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.910
And kept a copy for yourself.

22:10.110 --> 22:11.940
You're wrong, okay?
I don't do that.

22:12.140 --> 22:13.510
Well, if so, you'd be

22:13.710 --> 22:14.950
the first private detective
in history who doesn't.

22:15.150 --> 22:17.180
Guys, I don't know
what to tell you.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.080
Get the recordings off Wexler,
why don't you?

22:19.280 --> 22:20.450
Well, for some reason,

22:20.650 --> 22:22.690
Mr. Wexler is choosing
not to provide them.

22:22.890 --> 22:24.720
HAYWOOD:
And if you don't
provide us with them,

22:24.920 --> 22:26.960
we're gonna head over
to the U.S. Attorney

22:27.160 --> 22:28.430
for the Eastern District's
office,

22:28.630 --> 22:30.530
and we're going to make
what I know will be

22:30.730 --> 22:33.900
a compelling case
to obtain a search warrant,

22:34.100 --> 22:35.900
a search warrant
that will specify

22:36.100 --> 22:39.240
every square inch
of your office,

22:39.440 --> 22:42.840
residence, vehicles
and any other property

22:43.040 --> 22:44.410
you have direct access to,

22:44.610 --> 22:46.940
searched with a fine-tooth comb.

22:47.140 --> 22:49.750
That's insane.

22:49.950 --> 22:52.920
No judge would issue
such a broad warrant.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.690
SUAREZ:
Prosecutors don't get killed
every day, Mr. Farris,

22:54.890 --> 22:57.320
and so the Feds' approach
will be a little bit more

22:57.520 --> 22:59.720
flexible to
Fourth Amendment considerations.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.560
HAYWOOD:
Since the search of your
premises will be exhaustive,

23:02.760 --> 23:04.800
you can expect that
the confidentiality

23:05.000 --> 23:06.260
of all of
your clients

23:06.460 --> 23:09.650
will be compromised,
leading you to consider...

23:11.250 --> 23:13.420
...a different line of work.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.210
DIANE (recording):
<i>Sarah...</i>

23:17.410 --> 23:19.640
Wexler is trading
reduced sentences for sex.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.710
Why won't you let
this go, Diane?

23:21.910 --> 23:23.350
We've worked with him
for years.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.580
You know he's not
capable of that.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.890
DIANE:
You refuse to even consider
that it might be true.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.890
SARAH:
Okay. Are any of these women
willing to testify?

23:31.090 --> 23:32.520
DIANE:
I'm working on it.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.760
SARAH:
When you find one who'll
testify-- under oath--

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
that Paul Wexler traded
reduced sentences for sex,

23:37.160 --> 23:38.530
you let me know.

23:38.730 --> 23:40.360
Until then, as far as I'm
concerned, it never happened.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.580
(recording clicks off)

23:43.820 --> 23:44.900
It's rape.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.040
If Diane told him
what she suspected

23:47.240 --> 23:48.810
or what these
women told her,

23:49.010 --> 23:50.840
he'd have all the motive
he needed to kill her.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.240
Yeah, but these recordings are
from a week ago.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.250
Diane said nothing
about going to Wexler.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.700
Maybe she isn't the one
who went to him.

23:59.430 --> 24:02.340
I think you should go
see Sarah McKay.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.960
So, what did
these recordings tell you?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.260
One thing
they told us was that

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
Diane was warning you
about Wexler.

24:09.660 --> 24:12.030
I think that says more about
Diane than it does about Paul.

24:12.230 --> 24:14.000
What does it say?

24:14.200 --> 24:16.100
Diane was a good person,

24:16.300 --> 24:17.570
but she could be erratic.

24:17.770 --> 24:19.440
MORALES: Uh-huh.
Like when she told you

24:19.640 --> 24:22.610
she believed Wexler was trading
sex for lenient treatment?

24:22.810 --> 24:25.380
Yes, for one.
Uh, she was obsessed with that.

24:25.580 --> 24:28.480
She told you she'd spoken
to one of the women?

24:28.680 --> 24:31.380
A drug addict who wouldn't go
on the record.

24:31.580 --> 24:32.780
Yeah, she told me.

24:32.980 --> 24:33.990
What about the others?

24:34.190 --> 24:35.900
I don't know of any others.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.520
But you know about Wexler.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.460
(inhales)

24:40.660 --> 24:42.930
Yeah, I do know about Wexler,

24:43.130 --> 24:44.410
because...

24:45.250 --> 24:48.430
...we've been in a relationship
for almost two years.

24:48.630 --> 24:50.230
His marriage is
basically over.

24:50.430 --> 24:53.770
He's just waiting till their
daughter finishes high school.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.410
KILLIAN:
And there was no

24:55.610 --> 24:57.410
indication that he had this

24:57.610 --> 25:00.080
quid pro quo going with
criminal defendants?

25:00.280 --> 25:01.180
No.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.110
Look, I've
made mistakes,

25:03.310 --> 25:04.750
but I wouldn't be
planning to spend

25:04.950 --> 25:07.050
the rest of my life with someone
capable of doing the things

25:07.250 --> 25:09.050
you're suggesting he did.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.920
I told that to Diane,
repeatedly,

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
but for whatever reason,

25:13.320 --> 25:15.590
she kept on in this delusion.

25:15.790 --> 25:17.430
Any idea
why she wouldn't let it go?

25:17.630 --> 25:20.160
I got the feeling something
had happened in her past.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.000
MORALES:
One more question, Sarah.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.840
Did you ever tell Wexler
about Diane's accusations?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.000
I did.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.100
A week ago.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.870
He thought
it was absurd,

25:29.070 --> 25:30.370
but he also was

25:30.570 --> 25:32.280
somewhat concerned about her.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.910
I think he made a plan for them
to talk, next week sometime.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.620
And then this.

25:37.820 --> 25:39.320
I...

25:39.520 --> 25:41.590
I really hope you find
who's responsible.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.320
Mm-hmm.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.210
(siren wailing)

25:46.140 --> 25:48.190
You know, the offer stands
if you still want to use

25:48.390 --> 25:50.330
my parent's place
in St. Croix.
Yeah?

25:50.530 --> 25:52.330
When am I gonna do
that? (chuckles)

25:52.530 --> 25:54.030
When you go
on your honeymoon.

25:54.230 --> 25:55.900
You know,

25:56.100 --> 25:59.540
it's possible that
honeymoons are a bad idea.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.670
Really?
As a general rule?

26:01.870 --> 26:03.980
No, I mean, people take them
right after they get married,

26:04.180 --> 26:05.310
which usually means

26:05.510 --> 26:06.910
they haven't been
together very long.

26:07.110 --> 26:09.150
And then they put the added
stress on themselves

26:09.350 --> 26:12.050
of airports, and

26:12.250 --> 26:14.590
luggage, and hotels,

26:14.790 --> 26:16.590
and how much
to tip the bellhop.

26:16.790 --> 26:20.160
My parent's place is a condo.
There is no bellhop.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.730
I am just saying
that traveling has

26:22.930 --> 26:25.060
a higher degree
of difficulty

26:25.260 --> 26:26.300
than staying at home.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.430
That's all I'm saying.

26:27.630 --> 26:29.670
So stay home.

26:29.870 --> 26:31.400
Stay home?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.370
What you mean?
And not get married?

26:33.570 --> 26:34.610
No, no, no, no.
Sandeford.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.010
Sandeford.
You still get married.

26:36.210 --> 26:38.080
Of course you're
getting married.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.410
You just...

26:39.610 --> 26:41.100
don't take a honeymoon.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.080
You have answers
for everything,

26:45.280 --> 26:46.150
don't you?

26:46.350 --> 26:47.520
Don't you?
I mean, I guess.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.500
Well, answer this,
you paying for dinner?

26:50.270 --> 26:52.710
* *

26:54.610 --> 26:56.230
(knock at door)

26:56.430 --> 26:57.560
HAYWOOD:
What's up?
Hey.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.160
We went back over
Diane's old case files.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.530
This time, not looking for
defendants with an axe to grind.

27:01.730 --> 27:03.770
Just women whom
Wexler had reduced charges

27:03.970 --> 27:05.700
or sentencing
recommendations.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.810
I presume a number of those
are legitimate.

27:09.010 --> 27:11.510
Some are, but we found five
cases that don't make sense.

27:11.710 --> 27:13.980
B and C felonies reduced
to misdemeanors.

27:14.180 --> 27:16.510
Serious jail time
cut to time served.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.620
Each of those,
the defendant was a woman of

27:18.820 --> 27:20.850
limited means
between 20 and 25.

27:21.050 --> 27:23.990
No guys got that deal.
Damn him.

27:24.190 --> 27:26.320
None of the five women are
at their original addresses.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.260
Diane found one.
So can we.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.030
Meanwhile,
let's put a little scare

27:30.230 --> 27:32.880
in our highly esteemed
District Attorney.

27:42.190 --> 27:43.240
How's it going?

27:43.440 --> 27:45.280
Thank you so much
for coming.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.680
Did you get
something to eat?

27:46.880 --> 27:49.050
(indistinct chatter)
Excuse me, Mr. Wexler.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.150
We talk to you
for a minute?

27:51.350 --> 27:52.580
Can it wait?

27:52.780 --> 27:54.990
Actually, it can't.

27:55.190 --> 27:57.150
(conversing indistinctly)

27:57.350 --> 27:58.290
I'll be right back.

27:58.490 --> 28:00.010
It's just
a little business thing.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.330
(Killian clears throat)

28:07.530 --> 28:08.670
This better be good.

28:08.870 --> 28:10.070
We'd like you to come

28:10.270 --> 28:11.940
to the station house
tomorrow, Mr. Wexler.

28:12.140 --> 28:15.140
Why is that?
Just to go over your
whereabouts Tuesday night.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.910
And why is that?

28:17.110 --> 28:18.380
We have an idea

28:18.580 --> 28:20.110
of what Diane might've been
threatening you with.

28:20.310 --> 28:21.950
Who said she was
threatening me with anything?
MORALES: Mm.

28:22.150 --> 28:24.580
We think that she was
threatening with one

28:24.780 --> 28:26.550
or more rape
prosecutions.

28:26.750 --> 28:29.190
(chuckles)
You're deranged.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.720
We've been through
Diane's files, Mr. Wexler.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.060
Not the ones
she kept at the office--

28:33.260 --> 28:34.790
the ones she kept
in her bedroom at home.

28:34.990 --> 28:37.030
Uh-huh.
We've read the notations

28:37.230 --> 28:38.630
she made regarding
the women with whom

28:38.830 --> 28:40.700
she thought that you traded
leniency for sex.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.900
MORALES:
Not that rape would've been
the easiest case to make,

28:44.100 --> 28:45.900
but with Diane
out of the picture,

28:46.100 --> 28:48.240
you would've had that much less
to worry about.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.770
Why are you telling me this?

28:49.970 --> 28:53.040
You wanted to be kept up-to-date
on the investigation.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.380
That's what we're doing.

28:54.580 --> 28:56.150
Really?
Mm-hmm.

28:56.350 --> 28:58.380
Well, you haven't been all
that cooperative, Mr. Wexler.

28:58.580 --> 28:59.930
It does raise suspicion.

29:02.370 --> 29:07.360
You have what you need
to make an arrest, Detectives?

29:07.560 --> 29:09.060
Hmm?

29:09.260 --> 29:10.380
No, sir.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.730
I'm gonna go back
to enjoying my evening

29:13.930 --> 29:15.830
with my wife and my friends.

29:16.030 --> 29:19.640
Now, unless you have
an appropriate change of attire,

29:19.840 --> 29:22.110
and $1,500 per person,

29:22.310 --> 29:24.940
I suggest that
you go back to your squad room

29:25.140 --> 29:28.510
in East New York
and search for the perp

29:28.710 --> 29:31.800
instead of making
fools of yourselves here.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.090
Good night.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.270
* *

29:39.640 --> 29:41.140
Rude.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.050
* *

29:55.160 --> 29:57.910
Thank you for taking the time
to talk to us, Ms. Drew.

29:58.110 --> 29:59.280
We were able
to locate you

29:59.480 --> 30:01.110
through the Department
of Correctional Services.

30:01.310 --> 30:02.850
I can only be down here
for a few minutes.

30:03.050 --> 30:04.680
Understandable.
You don't want to talk to us

30:04.880 --> 30:06.220
in front of the woman
you work for.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.620
Miss Dorothy's probably
calling for me already.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.650
We asked Cissy if what

30:10.850 --> 30:12.560
Diane Gould accused Wexler of
was true.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.860
Is it?

30:14.060 --> 30:16.330
I was in a bad spot.
He took advantage of it.

30:16.530 --> 30:17.730
What does that mean?

30:17.930 --> 30:19.800
It means we had sex.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.300
It means he raped you.
I let him.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.670
HAYWOOD: Mm.
MORALES:
You'd been convicted

30:23.870 --> 30:24.970
of fraud and embezzlement,

30:25.170 --> 30:26.500
were facing a prison sentence

30:26.700 --> 30:27.970
of three to five years,

30:28.170 --> 30:30.010
and based on a recommendation
from Mr. Wexler,

30:30.210 --> 30:31.810
the judge sentenced you
to time served.

30:32.010 --> 30:34.780
I would have had my kids taken
from me and put in foster care.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.110
By holding his recommendation
over your head,

30:37.310 --> 30:40.990
Wexler raped you just as surely
as if he'd been holding a gun.

30:41.190 --> 30:43.820
I ain't saying I didn't do
what they convicted me of.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.820
It doesn't matter.
If I hadn't stolen that money,

30:46.020 --> 30:47.720
I wouldn't have been
in that spot.
Cissy,

30:47.930 --> 30:50.530
it doesn't matter.
Hey, look, we think Paul
Wexler had something to do

30:50.730 --> 30:51.900
with the murder of a woman

30:52.100 --> 30:53.430
who threatened to expose
what he did to you,

30:53.630 --> 30:56.100
and, in all likelihood,
other women, as well.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.070
We're hoping you'll come forward
and testify against him.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.440
So he can have something
to do with my murder?

30:59.640 --> 31:00.770
KILLIAN:
If he gets convicted

31:00.970 --> 31:02.310
of rape and murder,

31:02.510 --> 31:03.980
he's never gonna see the light
of day again, all right?

31:04.180 --> 31:05.440
He will die in prison.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.280
No, I seen his big office.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.780
I've seen how many people
he boss around.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.720
Ain't nothing against y'all,
but I don't think

31:11.920 --> 31:13.280
you're gonna convict him
of anything.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.320
We can protect you, Cissy.
No, ma'am.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.340
You can't.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.110
<i>(knocking)</i>
SUAREZ:
<i>Come in.</i>

31:28.880 --> 31:31.040
Wexler's gone to the PC

31:31.240 --> 31:33.340
about your detectives
showing up last night.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.070
Is this really a conversation
that we should be having

31:36.270 --> 31:37.810
in front of the deputy mayor?
SHARPE:
You think

31:38.010 --> 31:39.380
I'm unaware
of these things, Inspector?

31:39.580 --> 31:40.710
I'm sure you work hard

31:40.910 --> 31:42.880
to stay current
on police issues.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.180
It's my responsibility
to protect

31:45.380 --> 31:47.320
the integrity of whatever
criminal investigations

31:47.520 --> 31:48.590
I'm overseeing.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.120
Well, maybe that's
the problem right there.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.290
Maybe you shouldn't be
overseeing them.
Whoa.

31:52.490 --> 31:55.140
That's up to Chief Suarez
to determine.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.190
I'd say, at the very minimum,

31:57.390 --> 31:59.100
your detectives
behaved inappropriately.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.730
I take full responsibility
for how my detectives behaved.

32:02.930 --> 32:04.600
As well you might!
Is the problem

32:04.800 --> 32:06.670
that Wexler was questioned
in a public place,

32:06.870 --> 32:08.070
or that he was
questioned at all?

32:08.270 --> 32:10.070
Let's not dance around this.

32:10.270 --> 32:11.740
He wasn't just questioned.
SUAREZ: Okay.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.280
He was accused of rape.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.850
Shall I quote to you the
statutory definition of rape?

32:16.050 --> 32:17.280
I didn't come here
for a refresher course

32:17.480 --> 32:18.920
in Criminal Law,
Deputy Inspector.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.340
One might be in order.
All right, that's enough!

32:28.680 --> 32:31.900
If there's probable
cause for an arrest,

32:32.100 --> 32:34.200
then we need to get
the attorney general involved.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.800
Regardless of that,
your detectives need to refrain

32:38.000 --> 32:39.800
from a campaign
of character assassination

32:40.000 --> 32:41.410
and public humiliation.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.710
Yes, sir.
Deputy Mayor Sharpe will

32:43.910 --> 32:46.040
respect the boundaries
between the police department

32:46.240 --> 32:48.450
and City Hall and whatever
conclusions are supported

32:48.650 --> 32:49.880
by the weight of evidence.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.630
Make sure she does the same.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.400
(footsteps approaching)

33:08.600 --> 33:10.300
Mr. Moynahan?

33:10.500 --> 33:11.640
Hmm?
Yes?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.040
I'm Dr. Patel.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.640
A personal friend
of Tom Killian's

33:14.840 --> 33:16.640
has asked me to take a look
at your father's case.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.480
There's a new protocol
I'd like to discuss with you.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.710
Would you both come
with me, please?

33:21.910 --> 33:23.510
Of course.
Me?

33:23.710 --> 33:26.470
Yeah, we're gonna go
with the doctor, Dad.
Okay.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.020
Thank you.
Oh.

33:30.220 --> 33:31.560
You good?
Yeah, yeah.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.140
Okay.
Okay.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.390
<i>(knocking)</i>

33:37.590 --> 33:38.800
(door opens)

33:39.000 --> 33:40.530
Inspector Haywood?
I am.

33:40.730 --> 33:43.430
I'm Sarah McKay. I got a
message you needed to see me?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.040
Come in, Ms. McKay.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.540
My condolences on the loss
of your colleague,

33:48.740 --> 33:49.970
Diane Gould.

33:50.170 --> 33:52.030
Friend. Thank you.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.110
Over the course
of the investigation

33:55.310 --> 33:57.380
of Diane's murder,
some information

33:57.580 --> 34:00.020
about Mr. Wexler
has emerged

34:00.220 --> 34:01.890
that I think you
should know about.

34:02.090 --> 34:04.490
Well, I'm not sure I know why
I would need to know about it.

34:04.690 --> 34:05.820
You told my detectives

34:06.020 --> 34:07.660
you're in a relationship
with Mr. Wexler.

34:07.860 --> 34:09.490
I would think you would want
to know about them.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.510
Well, I don't.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.870
Did you know a woman
named Cissy Drew?

34:15.070 --> 34:16.130
No.
Your office

34:16.330 --> 34:17.830
prosecuted her for embezzlement.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.840
King's County prosecutes
a lot of people

34:20.040 --> 34:21.170
for a lot of things.

34:21.370 --> 34:23.040
She told us
that Mr. Wexler

34:23.240 --> 34:24.810
recommended time served

34:25.010 --> 34:26.810
in return for sex.

34:27.010 --> 34:28.480
And you believe that?

34:28.680 --> 34:30.480
I believe it.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.720
More importantly,

34:32.920 --> 34:36.000
Diane Gould believed it,
which is what got her killed.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.490
(laughs)

34:38.690 --> 34:41.990
I don't know why people are
drawn to these wild stories.

34:42.190 --> 34:43.690
(laughs airily)

34:43.890 --> 34:46.360
Is it because they like
to bring other people down?

34:46.560 --> 34:49.400
You know, feed
on other people's misfortune?

34:49.600 --> 34:53.020
It might be because
they think they are true.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.360
I'm due in court.

35:00.330 --> 35:02.660
Excuse me.
(sniffles)

35:14.110 --> 35:16.160
* Whoo-ooh, hoo, ooh... *

35:16.360 --> 35:19.030
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

35:19.230 --> 35:21.030
This place looks busy.

35:21.230 --> 35:23.170
Yeah, it definitely picking up.

35:23.370 --> 35:25.700
Well, it's doing
its thing, you know?

35:25.900 --> 35:27.390
Yeah.

35:28.620 --> 35:32.040
Thank you for doing
what you did for my father.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.780
There's no way
the insurance companies

35:33.980 --> 35:35.210
would have covered
the treatments

35:35.410 --> 35:36.550
that Dr. Patel is
giving him.

35:36.750 --> 35:38.520
Oh, I hope it
makes a difference.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.980
It makes a difference
that he feels like

35:40.180 --> 35:41.250
he's getting taken care of.

35:41.450 --> 35:43.790
Good. Good, good, good.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.640
And I feel the same way.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.390
* Every little, little thing *

35:49.590 --> 35:51.910
* <i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i> *

35:52.710 --> 35:55.000
* We don't have
to talk about it... *

35:55.200 --> 35:56.400
SANDEFORD:
Oh.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.600
TAMIKA: Hey.
SANDEFORD: Hey.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.440
Hi.
Hey, Tamika.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.270
I'm going up to the bar.
Would you care for something?

36:01.470 --> 36:02.940
Uh, yes, Sancerre, please.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.610
You got it.
Thanks. Thanks.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.380
Huh.
Andre's folks

36:07.580 --> 36:08.910
have a condo
in St. Croix,

36:09.110 --> 36:10.250
and he says we can stay there.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.050
It's beautiful.
Have you been there?

36:12.250 --> 36:14.150
No, but Andre's
shown me pictures before.

36:14.350 --> 36:15.290
TAMIKA:
Ah.

36:15.490 --> 36:16.650
When were you thinking

36:16.850 --> 36:18.050
we'd go there, Marvin?

36:18.260 --> 36:20.160
Thinking we'd go there
for our honeymoon.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.060
That mean you still want
to get married?

36:23.260 --> 36:26.130
I've caused you
to doubt it, haven't I?

36:26.330 --> 36:27.760
Only because
you hadn't mentioned it

36:27.960 --> 36:29.100
for a couple of days.

36:29.300 --> 36:30.830
Oh, he mentioned it to me.

36:31.030 --> 36:32.770
Did he?

36:32.970 --> 36:34.610
All those hours walking
a foot post, you talk a lot.

36:34.810 --> 36:36.270
Sometimes, you say
what you're thinking.

36:36.470 --> 36:37.740
Sometimes, you don't say
what you're thinking,

36:37.940 --> 36:39.840
but your partner...
your partner knows anyway.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.250
Tamika?

36:42.450 --> 36:43.650
When I got shot,

36:43.850 --> 36:45.180
I saw how much love

36:45.380 --> 36:46.920
this guy had
in his heart for me.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.050
Oh, man.
Hey, I'm serious.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.490
And from listening to him,

36:51.690 --> 36:54.680
I know how much love
he has in his heart for you.

36:56.510 --> 36:58.500
If I didn't mention it,
maybe it was because

36:58.700 --> 37:01.600
there was a part of me that
didn't want anything to change,

37:01.800 --> 37:04.470
because in my mind,
everything was perfect,

37:04.670 --> 37:06.840
and I didn't want
to risk disappointing you,

37:07.040 --> 37:09.010
or disagreeing with you.
I didn't want to risk anything.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.540
I didn't even want
to breathe on it.

37:10.740 --> 37:12.730
Oh.

37:14.330 --> 37:17.910
You know it means something to
me to be married, though, right?

37:18.110 --> 37:19.480
Yes, I do.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.900
If it means something to you,
it means something to me.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.360
I love you, Marvin.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.470
And I love you.

37:28.810 --> 37:30.860
YENKO:
Now, in case
you were wondering, I happen

37:31.060 --> 37:32.660
to be fully-credentialed

37:32.860 --> 37:36.000
by the State of New York
as a marital officiant.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.380
(laughs)

37:40.720 --> 37:41.940
Shall we?

37:42.140 --> 37:44.070
What? Right here, now?

37:44.270 --> 37:45.410
Y-Yeah.

37:45.610 --> 37:46.940
Right-right here, right now.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.880
Yes.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.210
(laughter)

37:50.410 --> 37:51.550
For God's sake, then, marry us.

37:51.750 --> 37:52.950
(laughter)
All right, Bentley,

37:53.150 --> 37:54.420
you at least 18 years of age?

37:54.620 --> 37:55.690
I am.
All right, stand up.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.790
You're the witness.
Go over there.

37:57.990 --> 38:00.090
You-- bridesmaid.
Flank 'em.
Got it.

38:00.290 --> 38:02.130
Here you are, young lady.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.360
There you go. Hey. Hey.
Thank you.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.360
Everybody.
There's a wedding going on.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.730
OFFICER:
Oh, good.

38:07.930 --> 38:09.230
(laughs)
(exhales)

38:09.430 --> 38:12.000
Do you, Marvin Lucian Sandeford,

38:12.200 --> 38:15.340
take this woman
to be your lawfully-wedded wife?

38:15.540 --> 38:18.540
To love, to cherish,
to have and to hold,

38:18.740 --> 38:21.850
in sickness and in health,
for richer, for poorer,

38:22.050 --> 38:23.850
as long as you both shall live?

38:24.050 --> 38:25.700
I do.

38:26.630 --> 38:28.420
And do you, Tamika Martin,

38:28.620 --> 38:31.790
take this man to be
your lawfully-wedded husband?

38:31.990 --> 38:33.120
Yeah. (laughs)

38:33.320 --> 38:35.630
(applause and cheering)

38:35.830 --> 38:36.990
Congratulations.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.710
We did it! (laughing)

38:40.480 --> 38:43.380
* *

38:47.920 --> 38:49.270
KILLIAN: Wexler's body's
over here, boss.

38:49.470 --> 38:51.760
(siren wails)

38:54.030 --> 38:55.980
HAYWOOD:
Where is she?

38:56.180 --> 38:58.110
MORALES:
Over there.

38:58.310 --> 39:00.480
HAYWOOD:
We recover a weapon?

39:00.680 --> 39:03.020
Dropped right next
to the body.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.420
HAYWOOD:
Let's go.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.220
* When does it end *

39:06.420 --> 39:08.980
* And begin *

39:10.380 --> 39:14.520
* When does it rise *

39:15.450 --> 39:18.170
* Again... *

39:18.370 --> 39:20.340
How'd it happen, Sarah?

39:20.540 --> 39:22.870
I pressed him

39:23.070 --> 39:27.540
about the women he was supposed
to have taken advantage of.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.550
I pressed him about...

39:29.750 --> 39:32.220
the circumstances
of Diane's death.

39:32.420 --> 39:34.020
He became enraged

39:34.220 --> 39:36.220
that I wouldn't take
his answers at face value,

39:36.420 --> 39:38.020
that I kept
pressing him.

39:38.220 --> 39:41.160
I did what I'd learned to do
as a prosecutor.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.860
Who suggested you meet here?
I did.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.560
I thought
he wouldn't get violent

39:45.760 --> 39:47.500
if we met in a public place

39:47.700 --> 39:49.750
where there
were cameras.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.040
I was wrong about that.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.170
What'd he do?

39:53.370 --> 39:54.640
He put his hands around my neck,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.870
and he started to choke me,
and I wasn't going

39:57.070 --> 40:00.080
to let him do to me
what he did to Diane.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.080
So I shot him.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.150
* Rise again... *

40:04.350 --> 40:06.530
Was it self-defense, Sarah?

40:08.130 --> 40:12.570
I think it would qualify
as self-defense, yes.

40:14.070 --> 40:16.360
You understand we're going
to have to arrest you now?

40:16.560 --> 40:18.260
I do understand.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.780
I'm familiar with the process.

40:23.350 --> 40:27.690
* Rise... *

40:32.660 --> 40:35.650
She says it was self-defense.
You buy it?

40:35.850 --> 40:38.350
A good prosecutor could
probably punch holes in it.

40:38.550 --> 40:40.350
But would they want to?

40:40.550 --> 40:43.020
Would they just want
to let it go?

40:43.220 --> 40:46.290
* And begin *
* <i>And begin</i> *

40:46.490 --> 40:50.990
* When does it rise *

40:51.190 --> 40:52.600
* Again? *
