WEBVTT

01:07.104 --> 01:08.307
- Oh my god.

01:10.377 --> 01:14.440
- What was that?

02:39.967 --> 02:41.967
- Suicide is precarious.

02:44.538 --> 02:46.069
There are a lotta different
schools of thought

02:46.138 --> 02:47.439
on killing yourself.

02:48.978 --> 02:50.541
Beyond just pro and con, I mean.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.448
And believe me,

02:54.516 --> 02:56.547
there is a totally pro-suicide
contingent out there.

02:57.814 --> 03:00.584
They just aren't as
vocal as the other guys.

03:01.752 --> 03:04.456
Because well, for the
most part, they're dead.

03:10.092 --> 03:12.695
Think this stuff would
kill you if you drank it?

03:14.430 --> 03:15.663
- Says it's toxic.

03:15.732 --> 03:17.699
- But is this, feel
a little woozy,

03:17.768 --> 03:19.703
I don't go to work
the next day toxic?

03:19.772 --> 03:22.503
Or is this, Lord hide the
eyes of your children,

03:22.572 --> 03:24.872
it's melting my face off toxic?

03:33.783 --> 03:36.387
For clean, pills
are your best bet.

03:36.456 --> 03:38.852
They're simple,
elegant, merciful.

03:38.921 --> 03:40.961
Just close your eyes
and wake up in the arms

03:41.030 --> 03:43.022
of whatever God you believe in.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.631
Unless you wake up three
months later to discover

03:45.699 --> 03:47.761
that you've just slipped
into a coma and some orderly

03:47.830 --> 03:50.001
has been charging
truckers 20 bucks a pop

03:50.070 --> 03:51.503
to have sex on you.

04:04.753 --> 04:08.720
But, who says taking yourself
out all neat-like is a virtue?

04:08.789 --> 04:13.024
Why not go out in a violent,
mangley way people remember?

05:26.331 --> 05:28.331
Tofu, extra firm tofu.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.997
Oh my god, veg, Vegenaise?

05:32.502 --> 05:34.001
What in the hell?

05:35.711 --> 05:38.742
I have a coupon for a meat
lovers and cheesy breadsticks.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.246
Don't rule this a suicide.

05:47.315 --> 05:50.721
The coroner's report should
read, "Cause of death,

05:51.724 --> 05:54.059
a broken heart and
a fucking rabbit."

06:09.242 --> 06:10.602
- What do you think?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.043
- What is it?

06:12.112 --> 06:13.645
- It's a rabbit.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.450
- Is it abstract?

06:17.118 --> 06:18.749
- No, it's a rabbit.

06:19.719 --> 06:21.950
Okay, his name is
Othor the Terrible.

06:22.019 --> 06:25.521
He's traveled through,
through hell and back

06:25.590 --> 06:27.822
to reclaim his lady rabbit.

06:27.891 --> 06:29.888
And now he's coming
home victorious,

06:29.957 --> 06:32.697
but having paid a heavy price.

06:33.631 --> 06:36.800
- So it's a metaphorical rabbit?

06:38.366 --> 06:42.206
- No. It's a rabbit who's
had some hard times, man.

06:42.275 --> 06:43.477
- I don't trust rabbits.

06:44.806 --> 06:47.012
- Hey, sweet rabbit, baby.

06:47.081 --> 06:47.976
- Thanks, babe.

06:59.024 --> 07:00.993
- "There are a lotta
different schools of thought

07:01.062 --> 07:02.023
on suicide.

07:03.232 --> 07:04.991
There are a lotta ways to die.

07:05.059 --> 07:07.127
Lately, I've considered
most of them.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.001
The one I can't
live with though,

07:10.070 --> 07:13.505
the death I can't abide is the
one that takes 60 years or so

07:13.574 --> 07:16.105
spending small days
in a small home,

07:16.941 --> 07:20.107
in a small suburb,
with anyone but you.

07:21.283 --> 07:22.581
I hope you miss me every day.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.980
And I hope you know
this is all your fault.

07:25.747 --> 07:28.082
Love always, Mia."

07:30.952 --> 07:32.955
I'm gonna need you to sign this.

07:59.349 --> 08:04.123
- Hey, uh, large meat lovers
and cheesy mozzarella sticks

08:04.192 --> 08:06.019
for one Steven Sanders.

08:06.088 --> 08:07.820
- Just slide it
through the crack.

08:07.889 --> 08:10.497
- What? That's ridiculous.

08:10.566 --> 08:12.928
That is also what
she said.

08:12.997 --> 08:14.463
- It's fine, just
you hand me the pie,

08:14.532 --> 08:15.530
I'll hand you the cash.

08:15.599 --> 08:16.966
- It won't fit, man.

08:17.034 --> 08:18.666
- Didn't you ever
play Tetris as a kid?

08:18.734 --> 08:20.035
- Not with pizza, no.

08:23.172 --> 08:25.777
Your toppings are gonna
be a mess now, dude.

08:29.318 --> 08:30.611
Something wrong with your face?

08:30.680 --> 08:31.713
- No. Why?

08:31.782 --> 08:33.180
- Do you have elephantiasis?

08:34.451 --> 08:35.782
- No.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.217
- Ah, just wondering.

08:37.285 --> 08:38.922
You know, my girlfriend's
got this thing

08:38.991 --> 08:40.594
that when she gets
nervous, she sweats a lot.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.757
Like a lot, like I am
genuinely concerned

08:42.826 --> 08:44.791
about her hydration sometimes.

08:44.859 --> 08:45.792
A sweaty little girl.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.694
I mean, it's not like,

08:47.762 --> 08:49.494
it isn't anything
like an eight-pound
testicle or anything,

08:49.563 --> 08:52.572
but she's got a couple a
extra t-shirts in her car.

08:52.641 --> 08:54.036
She's got this thing
of antiperspirant

08:54.105 --> 08:55.775
basically comes out of
a holster, you know?

08:55.843 --> 08:57.103
Yeah, one time I, I
delivered a pie to a lady,

08:57.172 --> 08:59.143
had a nipple right
on her eyeball.

08:59.212 --> 09:01.977
True story, nipple right there
in the corner of her eyeball.

09:02.046 --> 09:03.550
But it's all rock
and roll to me, man.

09:03.619 --> 09:05.251
I mean, 'cause we're
just, we're just living,

09:05.319 --> 09:06.349
you know, just living.

09:06.418 --> 09:07.214
There you go.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.186
- Listen, it's just
been a long day

09:10.255 --> 09:13.660
and I don't really feel like
seeing anybody right now.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.956
- I mean, you've been crying?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.958
Oh man, did your dad die?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.229
- What? Of course not? No.

09:23.031 --> 09:25.133
Why, why would you say that?

09:25.202 --> 09:27.904
- It's basically the
only acceptable reason

09:27.973 --> 09:30.776
for a grown-ass man
to cry, you know.

09:31.741 --> 09:33.141
- What if it was a girl?

09:34.979 --> 09:38.251
- Ah. Feelings and
shit, I get it.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.619
Well, enjoy your pie, sir.

09:40.688 --> 09:42.656
- How 'bout if I
tip you to listen?

09:44.252 --> 09:47.452
- So what's the
young lady's name?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.994
- Mia. I mean, Elaine,
Elaine, Elaine.

09:51.697 --> 09:54.701
- Huh. I dated an Elaine once.

09:55.870 --> 09:58.303
Yeah. Girl had immaculate
sentence structure.

09:58.372 --> 09:59.837
It was really something.

09:59.906 --> 10:01.307
Course she ended up
being an arsonist,

10:01.375 --> 10:03.075
which was unfortunate.

10:03.144 --> 10:07.811
- So what would you say to her
if you wanted to say goodbye?

10:07.879 --> 10:09.309
- I'd say, while
I'm at the store,

10:09.378 --> 10:12.147
please do not set my
cat on fire, you know.

10:12.216 --> 10:14.783
I mean she lived, my,
my cat, but you know,

10:14.852 --> 10:16.383
hasn't been the same ever since.

10:16.452 --> 10:18.791
Just kinda walks around
all bald and confused now.

10:38.443 --> 10:39.511
- Hey.

10:58.693 --> 11:01.493
- Kinda feel like we're in
Zach Braff movie right now.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.537
Nobody puts baby in
the corner.

11:05.606 --> 11:08.140
Wait a second. That's not right.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.575
Anyway, I think you're gonna
enjoy this Friday show, dude.

11:10.644 --> 11:12.406
It's totally fresh to death.

11:12.475 --> 11:15.209
Kinda like arena glam rock
with some heavy gangster

11:15.278 --> 11:18.444
rap influences, all
done in chip tune.

11:19.521 --> 11:21.117
I call it eight bit cock hop.

11:23.925 --> 11:25.455
You know you got a little
bit a sauce right there

11:25.524 --> 11:27.426
on the chin.

11:27.495 --> 11:28.828
Yeah, right, right there.

11:30.693 --> 11:31.732
- Go away.

11:52.252 --> 11:56.317
- Look, I'm sorry, Poodle.
He was a really chatty dude.

11:56.386 --> 11:58.189
I mean he wanted to
know all about my cat,

11:58.258 --> 12:00.759
and, and there was this girl
whose name he didn't know

12:00.828 --> 12:02.655
that he kept going
on and on about.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.228
Next thing you know, we're
talking about Paul Newman

12:05.297 --> 12:09.066
and wolves, and he's
probably gonna kill himself.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.373
Ah.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.937
Probably not. You know?

12:17.006 --> 12:18.807
Just a big maybe on that.

12:18.876 --> 12:20.408
I mean, who, who's to say?

12:20.477 --> 12:23.910
Huh, you know, 30% of
Americans do commit suicide

12:23.979 --> 12:25.217
every single day.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.512
- Ah.

12:26.581 --> 12:27.947
- And that's some
serious math right there.

12:28.016 --> 12:29.652
Some scary stuff.

12:29.721 --> 12:30.954
But, but he won't.

12:31.023 --> 12:33.185
He wouldn't, 'cause
he's, you know,

12:33.254 --> 12:34.861
he's got his stuff together.

12:34.930 --> 12:37.464
Little douchy, yeah
but,

12:37.533 --> 12:39.426
you know, he's fine.

12:40.734 --> 12:42.769
- We have to bake him a cake.

12:42.838 --> 12:45.135
- But I've got deliveries
to make, Poodle.

12:45.204 --> 12:49.436
- Yes, you do. Today,
we're delivering hope.

12:51.476 --> 12:52.545
- What?

12:52.614 --> 12:55.915
- Buttercream frosted hope.

13:06.493 --> 13:07.289
- Hey, Mia.

13:09.395 --> 13:10.226
Mia.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.559
Hello, I am Sockio Sockio.

13:15.196 --> 13:18.398
Hi, and I am Luigi Sockio.

13:18.467 --> 13:21.303
We are Italian and
we have-a mustaches.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.304
And we bring to you,
our ancestral food stuff

13:25.372 --> 13:27.979
from the ancient
island of Italy,

13:28.048 --> 13:31.049
which is where we
are from.

13:31.118 --> 13:33.853
- Okay, first of all,
Italy is a peninsula.

13:33.922 --> 13:37.088
And secondly, you're
a fucking asshole.

13:44.427 --> 13:47.264
- I wrote you a
dinner theater play.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.630
- Oh. Oh, I take back
what I said then.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.938
I'd like you to kill me now,

13:54.006 --> 13:55.469
so I don't have
a listen act two.

13:57.745 --> 13:59.813
- Well that was very hurtful.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.309
The second act is
a fierce takedown

14:02.378 --> 14:03.981
of the banking
industrial complex.

14:04.050 --> 14:06.348
And I think you would've
really enjoyed it.

14:06.416 --> 14:09.186
I'm only trying to
cheer you up, Mia, but

14:10.690 --> 14:12.458
fine, you know what?

14:12.527 --> 14:13.553
Have it your way.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.360
Here, pizza.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.527
- I can't eat that.

14:22.031 --> 14:23.596
- What do you mean?

14:25.738 --> 14:27.468
I mean, it's a good.

14:27.536 --> 14:29.542
It's from-a the place
around the corner.

14:29.610 --> 14:32.210
- I don't eat cheese.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.578
- What do you mean,
you don't eat cheese?

14:34.647 --> 14:36.114
- You know this.

14:37.284 --> 14:42.186
- I spent like forever
picking little pieces of ham

14:43.456 --> 14:47.554
and hamburger and emu off of
here, and it was really hot.

14:48.123 --> 14:49.623
I mean I burnt my,

14:49.692 --> 14:50.927
I didn't really, I didn't
actually burn myself,

14:50.996 --> 14:52.361
but I did it over and over again

14:52.429 --> 14:54.300
and it was really
uncomfortable for me.

14:54.369 --> 14:58.338
I'm trying really hard here,
Mia, and you don't even care.

15:01.104 --> 15:02.536
What do you want from me?

15:04.443 --> 15:06.477
You want me to let you
go? Is that what you want?

15:06.546 --> 15:07.372
- Yes.

15:07.441 --> 15:08.948
- Okay, well I, I can't do that.

15:09.017 --> 15:10.076
I mean, I'm just,
I'm brainstorming.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.511
Is there anything else?

15:11.580 --> 15:14.447
- Garrett, I don't know
what's going on here.

15:14.516 --> 15:17.316
I don't have a
fucking clue, okay.

15:17.385 --> 15:21.188
And, I'm not mad anymore, okay?

15:21.257 --> 15:24.591
So just, please, let me go.

15:27.032 --> 15:30.568
- I'll get you a
waffle.

15:35.641 --> 15:36.603
- Boy.

15:46.681 --> 15:50.882
How you bum
your leg, boy child?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.455
- I was part of the commando
unit sent in to squash

15:53.523 --> 15:55.860
some insurgent activity
over on Sycamore Drive.

15:55.929 --> 15:57.623
I busted my leg on extraction.

15:57.692 --> 16:00.093
- Ha, almost same
thing happens to me,

16:00.162 --> 16:02.267
outside of Hanoi in '72.

16:02.335 --> 16:05.867
Now, my leg parts, mostly
rebar and duct tape.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.005
It's the man in black pajamas
who I'm shooting at. You?

16:11.074 --> 16:12.006
- Fifth grade girls.

16:12.075 --> 16:13.976
- Ah, just as dangerous.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.406
- I hear you, brother.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.914
What kind of gun is that?

16:16.983 --> 16:18.814
- Makarov, nine millimeter.

16:18.883 --> 16:20.319
- Can I see it?

16:20.388 --> 16:21.219
- Sure.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.657
- Whoa. Can I shoot something?

16:25.726 --> 16:28.655
- Sure. Um, shoot Glen.

16:29.523 --> 16:32.059
No, no, no, no, no. I'm joking.

16:32.128 --> 16:34.133
It's joke, ha-ha.

16:36.501 --> 16:38.698
All right, maybe we
shoot Glen later, huh?

17:18.774 --> 17:21.373
- Hello, and welcome
to YouTube's edition

17:21.441 --> 17:23.578
of how to tie a noose.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.631
Step one in tying
noose, find a rope.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.891
Once you have your rope,

17:39.960 --> 17:43.197
you shall start tying
your noose as such.

17:55.647 --> 17:58.543
Now that you have learned
to tie a proper loop,

17:58.612 --> 18:00.818
you must now follow step 15.

18:00.887 --> 18:03.954
In step 15, you shall...

18:17.163 --> 18:21.400
Take the end of the rope and
place it through the bunny hole

18:21.469 --> 18:23.539
and out the rabbit hatch.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.584
And if you take that
last bit of string,

18:39.653 --> 18:42.657
pull it nice and tight, voila,

18:42.726 --> 18:46.463
you now have yourself
a full bonafide noose.

19:37.311 --> 19:38.350
- Hey.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.854
Oh, what happened here?

19:41.922 --> 19:43.923
- I dropped my waffle.

19:43.992 --> 19:46.655
Well, we'll get you another one.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.427
I don't want you to
eat off the floor.

19:51.365 --> 19:53.629
Okay. I'm gonna take
this off of you.

19:53.697 --> 19:55.334
What I don't want you to
do is be too mean to me.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.836
If I wanted to be brow
beaten or made fun of,

19:57.905 --> 19:58.865
I could call my mom.

20:00.341 --> 20:02.506
- What's with the neck
wear there, buddy?

20:03.910 --> 20:05.644
- Oh, this.

20:05.713 --> 20:09.341
Yes, well, I guess you decided
to hang yourself in the end.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.013
Out of guilt.

20:11.082 --> 20:12.450
It's a classic.

20:12.518 --> 20:14.315
- I don't think I did
decide to do that.

20:14.384 --> 20:16.081
I think I'd remember that.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.991
- Vegetables do weird
things to people's brains.

20:19.060 --> 20:19.989
You should stop eating them.

20:20.058 --> 20:21.025
- Let me go.

20:21.093 --> 20:22.661
- Oh, I can't do that.

20:22.730 --> 20:23.789
- Why?

20:23.858 --> 20:25.831
- I think you'd be
very upset if you knew.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.194
- You're gonna kill me.

20:27.262 --> 20:28.631
I'm upset!

20:28.699 --> 20:30.668
- Hey, please don't
be like this, don't.

20:30.737 --> 20:34.736
Can't you just, I'm a nice
guy. I'm a damn bunny rabbit.

20:35.839 --> 20:39.710
- Nice guys don't kidnap
and kill innocent people.

20:39.778 --> 20:44.944
Monsters do that, and
fuckheads. Fuckhead monsters.

20:46.684 --> 20:48.785
- He was cheating
on you, you know?

20:48.854 --> 20:49.948
- What?

20:50.017 --> 20:53.354
- You were one of
half a dozen girls

20:53.423 --> 20:54.922
he didn't even care about.

20:54.991 --> 20:56.822
I've actually taken the
liberty of putting together

20:56.891 --> 20:58.925
a PowerPoint
presentation for you.

21:00.802 --> 21:01.701
- A PowerPoint?

21:01.769 --> 21:03.034
- Oh yeah.

21:03.102 --> 21:05.470
Oh, there he is, Ben.

21:05.539 --> 21:08.368
He moved in with me
and ruined everything.

21:20.855 --> 21:21.750
- Whoo-hoo.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.957
- I hated the way he seduced
you with his slick ways

21:26.026 --> 21:27.959
and his sex parts.

21:40.171 --> 21:41.440
- Help! Help!

21:43.107 --> 21:44.204
Help.

21:44.273 --> 21:45.070
Help!

21:54.887 --> 21:55.685
- Hello?

21:57.387 --> 21:58.556
- He's really shy.

21:59.793 --> 22:02.025
He doesn't have elephantiasis
though. I'm pretty sure.

22:02.093 --> 22:02.923
- Uh, hey!

22:04.295 --> 22:07.798
Hey, open the door.

22:07.867 --> 22:08.698
Please.

22:14.141 --> 22:16.801
Hi. We brought you a cake.

22:16.870 --> 22:20.110
- She makes cakes. Pretty good.

22:20.179 --> 22:21.546
- Why are you here?

22:21.614 --> 22:24.417
- She made me leave work
early to buy cake stuff.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.486
- What happened to your hand?

22:29.221 --> 22:31.120
- It's from a monkey.

22:31.189 --> 22:32.623
- A monkey?

22:32.692 --> 22:37.760
- Yeah. I train helper
monkeys for citizens.

22:38.462 --> 22:39.394
Citizens who need monkeys.

22:39.462 --> 22:43.061
- Oh. I love monkeys.

22:43.130 --> 22:46.635
There's a monkey on
the cake. See?

22:46.704 --> 22:48.239
Can we come in and
meet the monkey?

22:48.308 --> 22:50.674
- No, no. God, no. He's angry.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.804
You actually need
to leave. Okay?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.042
But, thanks for the cake.

22:57.152 --> 23:00.017
Yeah, it looks, looks good.

23:00.086 --> 23:01.454
I like monkeys.

23:01.522 --> 23:05.287
- Wait. I just want you
to know that we're here.

23:05.356 --> 23:06.785
- I can see that.

23:06.854 --> 23:09.990
- No, I mean we're here for you.

23:11.065 --> 23:13.030
- I'm fine. Okay?

23:13.099 --> 23:14.164
- Oh my god.

23:14.233 --> 23:15.533
- What?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.503
- You have a noose
around your neck.

23:18.302 --> 23:19.164
- No, I don't.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.069
- Maybe we should go, Poodle.

23:22.905 --> 23:25.410
- There is a noose
around his neck.

23:25.479 --> 23:27.472
He is going to
kill himself, Rick.

23:27.541 --> 23:32.914
- Maybe he's a gasper, like
into autoerotic asphyxiation.

23:33.350 --> 23:34.684
I don't know.

23:34.753 --> 23:37.457
I, I feel weird. This is
really personal stuff.

23:38.193 --> 23:39.487
- I'm not gonna kill myself.

23:39.555 --> 23:40.890
- See, it's all good.

23:41.793 --> 23:43.355
Catch you at the
cock-hop show, right?

23:43.424 --> 23:44.426
- Yeah.

23:44.495 --> 23:46.165
- There is a noose around,

23:46.234 --> 23:47.431
there is a noose around you.

23:47.499 --> 23:49.297
There is a noose
around his neck.

23:49.365 --> 23:51.029
- Go away.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.500
- I don't think
he wants us here.

23:53.569 --> 23:55.207
- He does want us here.

23:55.276 --> 23:57.869
- Clearly, he doesn't. Clearly.

23:57.938 --> 24:00.111
- No one is killing anyone.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.547
My girlfriend and I,

24:01.615 --> 24:02.907
we just have a
complicated relationship.

24:02.976 --> 24:05.111
- I told you it was a sex thing.

24:06.185 --> 24:07.014
- That's it.

24:07.649 --> 24:09.115
That's it, we have uh,

24:09.951 --> 24:13.021
sweet, sweet,
complicated intercourse.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.920
But, I need you to go now
because of all the intercourse.

24:15.989 --> 24:17.961
So, thanks for the monkey cake.

24:18.030 --> 24:22.027
Okay, and, oh you, you might
wanna go run off to the car

24:22.096 --> 24:24.198
and grab one of
those extra shirts.

24:24.267 --> 24:28.673
Yeah, your pits are kind of
swampy. Okay now, bye-bye.

24:47.428 --> 24:49.792
I hate people.
Especially other people.

24:49.861 --> 24:52.493
You, you're not so bad,
but for the most part,

24:52.562 --> 24:55.328
people who need people,

24:55.396 --> 24:57.968
they are just the most
annoying people in the world.

24:58.037 --> 25:02.641
Some people will draw you in
with the way they have skin.

25:04.074 --> 25:07.173
Or, they smell like
vanilla coconut candy.

25:13.282 --> 25:16.086
And, then they make you feel
like you can trust them.

25:17.056 --> 25:20.285
And it turns out that they're
just big, fat liar cats,

25:20.354 --> 25:22.754
and that they're sleeping
with other people

25:22.823 --> 25:24.827
right behind your back.

25:24.896 --> 25:28.029
- I never slept with you
in front of your back.

25:29.129 --> 25:31.098
- Don't you see
how that's worse?

25:31.167 --> 25:33.197
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.866
- You can't ignore
me anymore, Mia.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.435
I mean, look at me.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.712
I'm the last thing
you're ever gonna see.

25:41.514 --> 25:44.377
What we had, it was cosmic.

25:44.445 --> 25:48.252
It was a love I thought was
gonna watch the stars turn cold.

25:48.321 --> 25:49.314
And you're just,

25:51.826 --> 25:56.156
anyway, I'm not mad at you,
I just want you to know,

25:57.231 --> 25:58.997
I mean, I forgive you.

25:59.066 --> 25:59.896
- Hm.

26:03.599 --> 26:05.336
- Help, help.

26:13.079 --> 26:14.345
Mia!

26:14.413 --> 26:19.245
Help, help me.

26:28.830 --> 26:31.863
- I'm sorry, Poodle. He was
having a really bad day.

26:31.932 --> 26:36.427
- A complete stranger. You
met him one time, Rick.

26:36.496 --> 26:38.303
Do you tell everybody
that your girlfriend

26:38.371 --> 26:39.838
has sweaty arm stains?

26:39.906 --> 26:42.070
Is that like your Facebook
status or something?

26:44.145 --> 26:44.974
- I love you.

26:46.743 --> 26:49.315
- Who else have you told?

26:49.384 --> 26:50.412
- What's important is that--

26:50.481 --> 26:51.376
- Who else?

26:53.453 --> 26:55.050
- Well--
- Who else?

26:56.919 --> 26:59.256
- I have told many, many people.

27:01.462 --> 27:02.855
- You know what your problem is?

27:02.924 --> 27:04.423
- I know several of them.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.293
- Do you even understand
what's happening right now?

27:06.362 --> 27:07.930
- I understand some of
what's happening right now.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.598
- You never even
notice what's going on

27:09.666 --> 27:10.632
right under your nose.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.096
- Are you kidding me?

27:12.165 --> 27:14.136
I'm like fucking Daredevil.

27:14.205 --> 27:18.271
Like hyper aware of, you
know, my shit at all times.

27:18.339 --> 27:21.641
- I'm hyper aware
that you're an idiot.

27:21.710 --> 27:22.644
- Is that nice?

27:24.415 --> 27:25.810
Hm-mm.

27:25.879 --> 27:26.917
Check this.

27:28.384 --> 27:32.520
There's a car, PT Cruiser,
hunter green, fairly mint.

27:34.292 --> 27:35.893
It's carrying three children,
about to round the corner.

27:35.962 --> 27:38.192
They're watching
SpongeBob in the backseat.

27:39.129 --> 27:41.165
Squidward's flipping
a Krabby Patty.

27:41.234 --> 27:46.431
The middle child has ADHD and
just ate Cheez-Its for lunch.

27:51.308 --> 27:53.775
Okay, but you got to admit
that would've been pretty dope.

27:53.844 --> 27:56.343
Also, Krabby Patty? Band name.

27:56.412 --> 27:58.977
- Do we even care that
he's going to kill himself?

27:59.045 --> 28:00.145
- He's not going to--

28:00.213 --> 28:02.184
- He has a noose
around his neck.

28:02.253 --> 28:06.552
- So? Flava Flav's been
wearing a clock since the '80s.

28:06.621 --> 28:07.924
- What?

28:07.993 --> 28:09.994
- I'm just saying, I've
seen worse fashion.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.056
Like, remember the time
Byork wore a fricking goose

28:12.125 --> 28:13.023
or whatever to the Oscars?

28:13.092 --> 28:14.498
Now that was fucked up.

28:14.566 --> 28:15.933
- You're unbelievable.

28:16.001 --> 28:17.737
- He said he's not
going to kill himself.

28:17.805 --> 28:19.199
- That's exactly what
someone would say

28:19.268 --> 28:21.501
if they were going
to kill themself.

28:21.570 --> 28:23.006
- Sure.

28:23.075 --> 28:24.907
But it's also exactly
what someone would say

28:24.976 --> 28:27.540
who's not going to
kill themselves.

28:27.609 --> 28:29.247
Huh?

28:29.315 --> 28:30.178
Conundrum.

28:35.050 --> 28:38.186
- Get in there and fix this,

28:38.254 --> 28:40.419
or find somewhere
else to sleep tonight.

28:48.401 --> 28:49.664
- No!

29:07.250 --> 29:10.856
- I have tried really
hard to be fair to you.

29:12.690 --> 29:13.819
I almost died up there.

29:19.531 --> 29:20.760
You scared me.

29:22.662 --> 29:24.865
If I had any idea how
to tie a proper knot,

29:24.933 --> 29:26.234
I'd be dead right now.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.249
How, how did you even?

29:43.217 --> 29:45.418
What, did you chew through this?

29:48.026 --> 29:49.724
You're not getting
any monkey cake.

29:49.793 --> 29:50.896
- Fuck you!

29:58.568 --> 29:59.668
- Steve?

29:59.737 --> 30:00.840
- Steve?

30:03.037 --> 30:04.437
- Damn, I hate people.

30:18.522 --> 30:19.485
Sh.

30:21.525 --> 30:22.356
- Steve?

30:24.826 --> 30:26.597
- Hold on.

30:37.478 --> 30:39.142
Why are you in my house?

30:40.378 --> 30:42.942
- I thought you were trying
to get our attention.

30:43.011 --> 30:44.377
- Well, I wasn't.

30:44.446 --> 30:47.547
- Oh my god. You have
scratches on your face.

30:47.616 --> 30:52.019
- Oh yeah, that's from the,
that's from the monkey.

30:52.088 --> 30:53.519
He's in a really foul mood.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.526
I don't know what
his problem is.

30:56.595 --> 30:57.358
- Where is he?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.564
- I sent him to his room to
think about what he had done.

31:02.633 --> 31:03.600
- Hm.

31:03.669 --> 31:05.202
- Did you spank him?

31:05.271 --> 31:08.435
You know, for being bad,
did you spank your monkey?

31:11.008 --> 31:13.440
- We were worried about you.

31:13.508 --> 31:17.609
- Can you worry about me
in someone else's house?

31:19.817 --> 31:21.085
- We're here for you.

31:21.852 --> 31:25.490
We care about you.

31:25.559 --> 31:28.323
- Super.

31:41.936 --> 31:43.473
- Mm.

31:43.542 --> 31:44.339
- Mm.

31:53.688 --> 31:57.253
- So, what's your monkey's name?

31:58.987 --> 32:00.190
- Ampersand.

32:03.090 --> 32:04.293
- Mm.

32:07.930 --> 32:09.530
Ah, uh, okay.

32:09.599 --> 32:14.600
Uh, Steve, we're worried
about you, uh, apparently.

32:19.509 --> 32:21.806
We want you to know
that we both like you.

32:22.742 --> 32:27.811
You are liked, and
you are a good person.

32:28.481 --> 32:29.747
I mean, probably, I don't know.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.020
Oh, you really shouldn't have
said that arm sweat thing

32:34.089 --> 32:35.455
to Abigail though.

32:35.524 --> 32:37.061
You know, I'm not gonna
get too down on you

32:37.130 --> 32:38.725
because you're going
through this whole

32:38.794 --> 32:40.531
killing yourself thing, but
that was messed up, dude.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.291
I'm just sayin'.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.630
It really was, but, but,
but we like you, a lot.

32:45.803 --> 32:46.632
Whole bunches.

32:48.042 --> 32:50.804
- How 'bout some
drinks with the cake?

32:50.873 --> 32:52.141
- Mm.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.706
- That would be lovely,
Steve. Thank you.

33:14.130 --> 33:17.630
- Oh. She's really pretty.

33:18.733 --> 33:21.168
- The prettiest
ones are the worst.

33:21.237 --> 33:23.472
- He doesn't mean you, Poodle.

33:23.541 --> 33:26.111
- Of course I don't mean
her. Why would I mean her?

33:26.812 --> 33:28.179
I said the pretty ones.

33:32.185 --> 33:35.516
- So what happened
between you guys?

33:40.991 --> 33:42.727
- She ruined my life.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.228
- How did she do that?

33:44.929 --> 33:45.861
- Doesn't matter.

33:45.930 --> 33:46.857
- It does matter.

33:47.593 --> 33:52.170
Because we care.

33:53.736 --> 33:56.801
- It just really wasn't any
one thing in particular.

33:58.778 --> 34:00.443
It's like this, okay.

34:00.512 --> 34:03.545
I used to bring her
flowers, and she's beautiful

34:03.614 --> 34:07.152
and so she expects flowers,
like they just appear.

34:07.221 --> 34:10.652
And one day I used my
key that she gave me.

34:10.721 --> 34:14.659
We exchanged keys and I used
my key to leave her flowers.

34:56.463 --> 34:58.764
- Ben, you got me flowers?

35:02.038 --> 35:04.874
- Yeah. I--

35:04.943 --> 35:06.508
- They're gorgeous.

35:09.046 --> 35:10.411
Look, there's a card.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.610
- Oh, hey, why
don't you let me uh,

35:13.679 --> 35:15.353
why don't you let me read that

35:15.421 --> 35:17.818
like one of those sexy,
romantic voiceovers, huh?

35:17.887 --> 35:18.718
- Okay.

35:28.194 --> 35:33.601
- In a desert life, you are
a refreshing, sexy beverage,

35:35.303 --> 35:36.906
like an Arnold Palmer.

35:36.975 --> 35:38.541
- Okay.

35:38.610 --> 35:41.873
- Or a Sprite that I think
about at night times.

35:44.816 --> 35:45.811
Love, Ben.

35:47.282 --> 35:49.419
- That's weird.

35:50.052 --> 35:51.454
- Yes.

35:54.728 --> 35:55.524
It is weird.

35:56.863 --> 35:57.896
- But it's sweet.

35:57.965 --> 36:00.958
- I have to have you, right now.

36:02.263 --> 36:03.461
- Right now?

36:03.530 --> 36:05.030
- Right this very second.

36:05.099 --> 36:05.930
- Okay.

36:26.089 --> 36:26.856
- Yeah.

36:29.895 --> 36:31.761
Oh, right there.

36:31.830 --> 36:32.660
Yeah.

36:34.768 --> 36:37.734
- Holy shit.

36:37.803 --> 36:38.896
- Wow.

36:38.965 --> 36:41.873
- So you were just under
the, like the whole?

36:41.942 --> 36:44.536
- That's really something.

36:44.605 --> 36:46.008
- Yeah.

36:46.077 --> 36:46.905
How are the drinks?

36:47.982 --> 36:50.113
- They smell funny.

36:50.182 --> 36:51.844
Like not a ha-ha funny, but.

36:53.053 --> 36:54.484
- Oh my god, that's strong.

36:54.552 --> 36:56.915
- Kind of burns. It
smell like it burns?

36:58.353 --> 37:00.859
- Oh, it's a cocktail.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.992
- Oh. We don't drink.

37:03.061 --> 37:04.758
- Nah. Gave up drinking.

37:05.658 --> 37:06.892
- You don't drink at all?

37:08.096 --> 37:08.894
- Nope.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.863
- Not even wine coolers?

37:11.866 --> 37:13.969
- Not even wine coolers.

37:21.381 --> 37:26.582
- Can I use your uh,
bathroom?

37:27.852 --> 37:30.487
- Oh, oh yeah. Right, right
down the hall to the right.

37:33.058 --> 37:34.887
- Thank you.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.366
- Dude, she freaks
out about smoke.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.902
- You know where
people don't smoke?

37:45.971 --> 37:47.305
Your house.

37:47.374 --> 37:48.735
- Dude, just be
chill. We're leaving.

37:48.804 --> 37:51.310
Just give her some peace
of mind so we can go.

37:59.884 --> 38:00.649
Oh, god.

38:01.915 --> 38:03.949
If she asks, you
drank these, okay?

38:24.571 --> 38:26.972
God. This is not good.

38:27.807 --> 38:30.243
It tastes like hate.

38:30.312 --> 38:31.515
I'm burning.

38:44.859 --> 38:48.195
Wait a minute. Why
are you kicking?

38:48.264 --> 38:49.398
- I'm sorry.

38:49.467 --> 38:52.837
- Ow, stop it!

38:58.946 --> 39:00.911
Oh, man, I'm sick!

39:00.980 --> 39:02.139
- Oh my god.

39:02.207 --> 39:03.978
- Hurry, grab a towel
from the bathroom.

39:04.047 --> 39:06.148
Go!

39:06.217 --> 39:07.947
Hurry. I know CPR.

39:09.817 --> 39:12.120
Shut up. Shut up.

39:12.189 --> 39:13.289
- Where is it?

39:13.358 --> 39:15.487
- Oh god, just keep looking.

39:15.556 --> 39:16.522
- It's not in here.

39:16.590 --> 39:18.060
- Look in the closet.

39:22.436 --> 39:24.165
- Don't hit me with the
blender, please don't.

39:31.839 --> 39:34.039
- I can't find it
anywhere. Rick?

39:35.211 --> 39:36.041
Rick?

39:52.228 --> 39:53.058
Rick?

40:00.236 --> 40:01.066
Rick?

40:04.009 --> 40:04.839
Rick?

40:06.341 --> 40:07.171
Rick?

40:52.553 --> 40:53.756
- Okay, okay.

40:54.792 --> 40:57.226
Calm down. Calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:01.431 --> 41:03.396
Calm down. Calm down.

41:03.464 --> 41:04.265
Just, shh.

41:06.171 --> 41:07.505
Stop, okay.

41:07.574 --> 41:09.271
Just, I know this
probably looks bad,

41:09.340 --> 41:10.575
but it's gonna be fine.

41:13.010 --> 41:15.914
It's not like I'm collecting
people or anything.

41:17.249 --> 41:18.280
Mia, say something.

41:19.985 --> 41:21.214
Mia.

41:21.283 --> 41:22.147
Mia. Sh.

41:26.255 --> 41:27.086
Mia?

41:28.059 --> 41:28.890
Mia?

41:42.634 --> 41:44.173
Hey.

41:52.252 --> 41:55.215
Oh!

41:55.284 --> 41:56.181
Oh!

42:00.325 --> 42:02.259
- What are you doing?

42:02.328 --> 42:03.760
- I was saving your life.

42:04.997 --> 42:08.196
- What, are you trying to
save me so you can kill me?

42:08.265 --> 42:10.034
- No.

42:11.269 --> 42:12.197
Yeah, I guess.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.167
- Oh god, who is she?

42:16.170 --> 42:18.136
Is she another girl
that won't date you?

42:18.205 --> 42:22.245
- Um, that's the, the
pizza guy's girlfriend.

42:22.314 --> 42:23.345
It's a whole thing.

42:23.414 --> 42:25.143
Listen, how do you feel?

42:29.849 --> 42:31.990
I'll get you some water.

42:54.339 --> 42:57.314
- Mia?
You're not home yet?

42:57.382 --> 42:58.815
You give Barry a call.

42:58.884 --> 43:01.048
You let mom, dad know
you are healthy, okay?

43:01.116 --> 43:03.752
Barry is by to check
on the roof at five.

43:03.821 --> 43:05.750
Will also make sure
all is correct.

43:07.556 --> 43:08.385
- Who's Barry?

43:09.927 --> 43:13.060
- My landlord. We've
been over this.

43:13.761 --> 43:14.996
- Landlord Barry.

43:17.499 --> 43:18.329
Band name.

43:19.131 --> 43:20.864
- Does he have your key too?

43:20.933 --> 43:23.134
- He's my landlord.

43:23.203 --> 43:26.243
- Well, great. I'm
gonna have to kill him.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.879
- Why would you do that?

43:27.947 --> 43:31.276
- Is this, is
this because of the cake?

43:35.787 --> 43:38.286
- Call him and tell
him not to come.

43:38.355 --> 43:39.390
- No.

43:39.459 --> 43:41.385
- Do you not see how this works?

43:42.994 --> 43:45.895
If he comes over here,
I have to kill him.

43:47.098 --> 43:49.894
Have you seen this chick?
Or how 'bout this guy?

43:49.962 --> 43:52.232
This is the pizza guy.

43:52.300 --> 43:55.202
The pizza guy comes
over, I have to kill him.

43:55.270 --> 43:59.410
He brings his girlfriend,
I have to kill her.

43:59.479 --> 44:01.310
A bell rings, I kill someone.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.111
You want this Barry guy dead?

44:04.979 --> 44:08.814
Fine. Just let him come over.

44:08.883 --> 44:10.651
Anyone else you want dead?

44:10.719 --> 44:12.284
Just give 'em a ring.

44:12.353 --> 44:13.886
Give 'em a ring and
have 'em come on down

44:13.955 --> 44:15.318
to Garrett's death emporium.

44:15.387 --> 44:17.294
We're having a
half-off sale today.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.094
Everyone must go.

44:19.162 --> 44:22.162
- Anyone have Justin
Bieber's number?

44:29.208 --> 44:30.241
- Oh, god.

44:30.310 --> 44:31.401
- worth it.

44:31.470 --> 44:36.110
- It was just flour,
sugar and love.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.114
- Fine. Give me the phone.

44:51.231 --> 44:52.022
- Hello?

44:52.091 --> 44:54.258
- Hey Barry, this is Mia.

44:54.327 --> 44:57.063
I got your message,
and I'm okay.

44:57.131 --> 44:59.264
- Yeah? Why
didn't you call?

44:59.333 --> 45:01.898
Your mom, dad's
calling me. It's nuts.

45:01.967 --> 45:03.073
- Shopping.

45:03.142 --> 45:03.702
- What?

45:03.771 --> 45:04.809
- Shopping.

45:05.972 --> 45:08.138
- I've been shopping.

45:08.207 --> 45:10.375
- Barry checks roofs.

45:10.444 --> 45:15.512
- Uh, no. Um, don't
come over. I'm naked.

45:16.553 --> 45:17.686
- What?

45:17.755 --> 45:19.420
- Yeah, I'm shopping naked.

45:19.489 --> 45:22.823
And I'm going to be naked for
the foreseeable future, so,

45:22.892 --> 45:24.825
please, please don't come over

45:24.894 --> 45:26.858
unless you wanna see me naked.

45:26.927 --> 45:28.393
Thanks Barry. Bye.

45:34.068 --> 45:36.934
- I hate all of you so much.

45:37.003 --> 45:38.403
- You ordered the pizza.

45:41.873 --> 45:43.243
- What?

45:43.311 --> 45:44.915
- I didn't come here
for the hell of it.

45:44.984 --> 45:47.083
You brought me here.
You ordered the pizza.

45:47.152 --> 45:49.986
- I'm not killing you
because you brought a pizza.

45:50.719 --> 45:52.053
That was fine.

45:52.122 --> 45:54.821
I'm killing you
because you came back.

45:54.890 --> 45:56.422
- I didn't wanna do that.

45:56.491 --> 45:59.026
- Fine then, it's the
sweathog's fault, whatever.

45:59.094 --> 46:01.661
- Oh, shit.

46:01.730 --> 46:02.559
You're right.

46:03.766 --> 46:04.962
This is all your fault.

46:06.566 --> 46:09.267
Oh, knock it off. I might
be dead because of you.

46:09.336 --> 46:10.539
At least give me
some peace for once

46:10.608 --> 46:12.210
in your ridiculous life.

46:13.373 --> 46:15.073
- What the hell are
you doing, dude?

46:15.142 --> 46:18.541
- And you know what? I do drink.

46:18.610 --> 46:21.886
I drink all the time
and it is awesome.

46:21.954 --> 46:24.253
It's how I put up
with you for so long.

46:24.322 --> 46:26.919
But there ain't enough beer
in the world at this point.

46:26.988 --> 46:28.259
You know what I'm saying?

46:28.328 --> 46:29.687
- Knock it off.

46:29.755 --> 46:35.130
- No. I am so sick of this
shit I could vomit, more.

46:36.399 --> 46:37.901
The next time this little
shit writes a murder note,

46:37.970 --> 46:39.398
it should be about
our relationship.

46:39.467 --> 46:42.636
Because that thing is
deader than a cat box.

46:43.808 --> 46:46.206
And I mean gone, baby, gone.

46:46.275 --> 46:48.678
Which is an awesome
movie, by the way.

46:48.747 --> 46:50.378
- You're breaking up with me?

46:50.447 --> 46:53.412
- You're breaking up with her
in the middle of all this?

46:53.481 --> 46:56.448
- I wanna switch sides
now. Can I do that?

46:57.484 --> 47:01.486
- Is this because of
the cake?

47:07.664 --> 47:09.631
- Unbelievable.

47:11.102 --> 47:14.203
I have to kill myself
very, very dead,

47:14.272 --> 47:16.301
because of all the guilt
from all the murders I did

47:16.370 --> 47:19.307
in my gang, because
I'm in a gang,

47:19.375 --> 47:22.139
which you probably didn't
know, but it's true.

47:22.207 --> 47:24.245
- Damn this thug life!

47:30.154 --> 47:32.018
- It was just a
peanut butter party.

47:32.087 --> 47:33.752
Should have been safe as houses,

47:33.821 --> 47:38.093
but I have to commit suicide
now because I feel really bad,

47:38.162 --> 47:40.860
because of all the
dying that happened.

47:40.929 --> 47:42.593
- Damn you, E. coli!

47:47.072 --> 47:50.436
- I'm not signing
it. It's ridiculous.

48:14.631 --> 48:15.461
- Mia?

48:17.537 --> 48:19.135
Mia, where are you?

48:28.474 --> 48:32.412
Mia, this is
disgusting. You are bad.

48:32.480 --> 48:35.415
There is no party
time in Barry's house.

48:35.483 --> 48:38.583
Few people. This is
Barry's house, Mia.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.217
Mia?

48:55.737 --> 48:56.568
Mia?

49:15.693 --> 49:16.621
Lord Jesus.

49:21.567 --> 49:22.930
- Stay there.

49:22.998 --> 49:24.596
Simon says no moving.

49:26.166 --> 49:28.072
Stay on the ground.

49:37.176 --> 49:38.747
Stop moving.

49:38.816 --> 49:41.415
- Not moving, breathing.

49:42.754 --> 49:44.049
- Well, knock it off.

49:44.118 --> 49:45.488
Did you call the police?

49:45.557 --> 49:46.823
- No.

49:46.892 --> 49:49.790
- What'd you see in the closet?

49:49.858 --> 49:51.457
- Nothing.

49:51.526 --> 49:53.630
- Then why did you
say "Lord Jesus?"

49:53.699 --> 49:55.099
- Because you scared me.

49:57.502 --> 49:58.832
- Liar.

50:09.613 --> 50:13.579
- That is so just like you
to say some shit like that.

50:13.648 --> 50:15.779
You know this whole
relationship, you've acted like,

50:15.848 --> 50:18.115
just because I live in
your parents' basement

50:18.184 --> 50:19.685
that you own me.

50:19.754 --> 50:22.125
Do you know how that makes
me feel on the inside?

50:22.194 --> 50:27.362
Makes me feel cheap, and
sad. Like an emo song.

50:28.065 --> 50:29.733
I don't wanna be an emo song.

50:29.802 --> 50:31.460
I do not own skinny jeans.

50:33.699 --> 50:36.540
That is a damn lie
and you know it.

50:47.216 --> 50:50.187
- Okay, everyone. This is Barry.

50:51.218 --> 50:52.486
I think you know Mia.

50:53.792 --> 50:55.192
That's the pizza guy,

50:55.261 --> 50:57.624
and that is his crazy
annoying girlfriend

50:57.692 --> 51:01.698
who likes monkeys and cake.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.700
What was your name?

51:02.768 --> 51:04.097
Oh, it doesn't matter.

51:05.500 --> 51:08.034
- Someone gave him
a gun. Awesome.

51:08.103 --> 51:10.002
- Where'd you get a gun?

51:10.071 --> 51:11.268
- It's Barry's.

51:12.172 --> 51:13.705
Stop crying.

51:15.513 --> 51:18.313
How have you not died from
dehydration at this point?

51:18.382 --> 51:20.415
Or from someone
choking you to death?

51:20.484 --> 51:22.350
- Well, believe me,
I've thought about it.

51:22.419 --> 51:24.452
- What are
you doing to them?

51:27.089 --> 51:28.589
- Whatever I like.

51:28.658 --> 51:31.526
- Barry will
kill you from the throat,

51:31.595 --> 51:34.730
and then I will brunch
on you and your testicles

51:34.799 --> 51:35.764
with mint jelly.

51:37.398 --> 51:38.829
- What does that even mean?

51:38.898 --> 51:41.035
- I will tear your
tendons from their parts.

51:41.104 --> 51:43.900
- Just shut up.

51:44.903 --> 51:46.805
I mean, I could
shoot you right now.

51:46.874 --> 51:50.914
- Oh, if you shoot me, the
neighbors will call the police,

51:50.983 --> 51:52.247
and then the police will come

51:52.316 --> 51:53.910
and make much
holes in your body.

51:53.978 --> 51:56.949
- Seriously, I need
you to stop talking.

51:57.018 --> 51:57.819
- Huh.

52:01.519 --> 52:03.022
- I think Abigail--

52:03.090 --> 52:04.356
- Abigail.

52:04.425 --> 52:06.625
- I think Abigail will calm down

52:06.694 --> 52:09.698
if you take the gag
out of her mouth.

52:09.767 --> 52:10.766
- No.

52:10.834 --> 52:11.869
- No way.

52:13.665 --> 52:15.635
- I am going to watch you die,

52:15.704 --> 52:18.072
and it'll make me very
happy to see the worms

52:18.141 --> 52:19.804
flirting with your corpse.

52:21.013 --> 52:22.880
- I will shoot you in the face

52:22.949 --> 52:25.981
if you do not shut your mouth.

52:26.050 --> 52:27.680
- Go ahead, slime weasel.

52:28.617 --> 52:30.652
And I hope my blood
splatters all over you,

52:30.721 --> 52:33.751
and you can not remove my
sticky brains from your hairs,

52:33.820 --> 52:35.689
and the flies make
a home in your head

52:35.757 --> 52:38.794
and lay eggs in your
marrow and eat your bones

52:38.863 --> 52:40.231
from the inside!

52:42.100 --> 52:45.203
- Holy shit.

52:48.841 --> 52:50.208
No crying or screaming.

52:54.272 --> 52:55.279
- Great.

52:58.580 --> 53:01.581
Listen, dude, I've
been thinking,

53:01.650 --> 53:04.519
you really don't need
four hostages, you know?

53:04.588 --> 53:07.021
It's just more people
to worry about, right?

53:07.090 --> 53:08.490
So keep the girls,

53:08.559 --> 53:09.927
let me walk on outta here.

53:09.996 --> 53:11.590
Hell, I'll help out, you know,

53:11.659 --> 53:13.658
tighten the security
in this bitch.

53:13.727 --> 53:16.828
- I don't need
help. You need help.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.472
Your landlord is just psychotic.

53:24.142 --> 53:26.376
- You're running out of chairs.

53:38.022 --> 53:39.890
- Put this on.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.795
- Are you kidding me?

53:50.864 --> 53:52.596
Like you've never
been taken hostage

53:52.665 --> 53:54.333
and held at gunpoint before.

53:54.402 --> 53:56.267
Really?

53:56.336 --> 53:58.804
No? Just me.

53:59.540 --> 54:01.710
- Shut your woman up or I will.

54:02.746 --> 54:06.713
- Steve, Steve, there's
no need for, for firearms.

54:06.781 --> 54:09.986
Hey, come on, we're,
we're a team, Steve.

54:10.054 --> 54:11.718
- His name is Garrett.

54:13.125 --> 54:15.623
Steve, I think is an alias?

54:16.755 --> 54:18.928
- I wanna thank you for that.

54:18.997 --> 54:20.397
- You're welcome.

54:22.099 --> 54:23.060
- Dude, you lied to me?

54:24.030 --> 54:26.836
I bet you don't even
own a monkey, do you?

54:28.701 --> 54:30.040
- I'm gonna name
a bleeding ulcer

54:30.109 --> 54:32.204
after each and every one of you.

54:32.273 --> 54:33.311
Two for you.

54:36.982 --> 54:38.349
Stop looking at me.

55:06.376 --> 55:08.674
- Whoa.

55:08.743 --> 55:10.412
Jesus, what the,
what the fuck, man?

55:10.481 --> 55:11.945
- You
ruined everything.

55:12.014 --> 55:13.350
- What?

55:13.419 --> 55:15.848
Just stop. Garrett, stop
it right now. Jesus!

55:15.916 --> 55:18.786
- You stole my flowers
and did sex on me.

55:18.855 --> 55:20.453
- Yeah, well if you don't
want sex done on you,

55:20.522 --> 55:21.786
don't break into people's homes

55:21.855 --> 55:23.724
and hide under
their bed, creepy.

55:25.062 --> 55:25.990
- You knew?

55:26.927 --> 55:29.125
- Yeah, I knew. I
was extra bouncy.

55:30.167 --> 55:31.100
- I'm moving out.

55:31.168 --> 55:32.735
- Well, good for you.

55:32.803 --> 55:35.336
Me and Mia are moving in
together, so keep the house.

55:35.405 --> 55:37.569
We're gonna have so much sex.

55:37.638 --> 55:38.736
Whoa!

55:38.804 --> 55:40.311
Stop.

55:40.380 --> 55:42.510
Garrett, would you
stop it right now.

55:42.579 --> 55:44.448
That's it, I'm
gonna kick your ass.

55:44.517 --> 55:45.942
You better check your
damn insurance policy

55:46.011 --> 55:48.016
to make sure it
covers ass-kicking.

55:48.084 --> 55:49.352
- Oh yeah?

55:49.421 --> 55:50.450
- What're you
gonna do with that?

55:50.519 --> 55:51.583
Huh? You gonna hit me with that?

55:51.652 --> 55:53.824
Come on.

56:13.606 --> 56:15.039
- Oh, this is not good.

57:13.671 --> 57:18.240
- So, we are going to
discuss the possibility,

57:18.309 --> 57:19.608
the very real possibility

57:19.677 --> 57:22.271
of me letting
everyone go, perhaps.

57:22.340 --> 57:24.911
Without and, and this
is really key, okay?

57:24.979 --> 57:27.782
Without me getting into
any trouble whatsoever.

57:29.253 --> 57:31.253
Speaking duck. Okay?

57:31.321 --> 57:32.923
Whoever has the duck--

57:32.992 --> 57:33.821
- Whomever.

57:34.893 --> 57:35.652
- What?

57:35.721 --> 57:37.121
- Whomever has the duck.

57:38.226 --> 57:39.057
- Right.

57:40.027 --> 57:43.994
- Whomever has the
duck has the floor.

57:44.062 --> 57:46.198
- You're actually
gonna let us go?

57:46.267 --> 57:47.598
- Yeah.

57:47.667 --> 57:48.966
Well everyone but Barry.

57:49.035 --> 57:51.570
Barry has seen too
much, so Barry's boned.

57:51.638 --> 57:53.138
- What did Barry see?

57:53.207 --> 57:55.476
- Barry has seen a
hundred-fold times your death,

57:55.545 --> 57:57.679
delivered by the hands of Barry.

57:57.748 --> 58:00.446
- Damn it, Barry, this
is why no one likes you.

58:00.515 --> 58:01.980
That was really creepy.

58:02.049 --> 58:04.582
Okay, and, you did
not have the duck.

58:04.651 --> 58:06.318
- Give me the duck.

58:06.387 --> 58:08.085
- No, you're just gonna say
things about killing me again.

58:08.154 --> 58:11.054
- I have additions,
addendums, modification,

58:11.123 --> 58:13.057
Bible references, which
I will list to you

58:13.126 --> 58:16.532
if you give Barry
the fucking duck.

58:16.601 --> 58:18.569
- You're not getting
the damn duck.

58:20.304 --> 58:21.198
- May I have the duck?

58:23.241 --> 58:24.773
- Yeah. Yes, you may.

58:25.509 --> 58:27.171
I mean, how hard
is that, really?

58:31.343 --> 58:35.850
- I think we should go
on the honor system.

58:35.919 --> 58:39.289
We can swear not to
tell anyone about you.

58:39.358 --> 58:43.088
We, we can pinky swear.

58:45.461 --> 58:47.261
- That's not gonna work.

58:47.329 --> 58:48.159
- Why not?

58:54.338 --> 58:56.034
Thank you. Why not?

58:56.103 --> 58:58.268
- Because if I had
poisoned and tied up

58:58.337 --> 59:01.275
and tried to hang me,
I would tell on me.

59:11.256 --> 59:12.956
- How 'bout this?

59:13.025 --> 59:16.353
How about you hook us each up
with a gallon or two of water,

59:16.422 --> 59:20.528
maybe some straws, then hop
on a plane and bomb away

59:20.597 --> 59:22.633
to a non-extradition country.

59:22.702 --> 59:25.401
Then when you land,
you can call the cops

59:25.470 --> 59:27.099
and tell them where we are.

59:27.934 --> 59:29.332
Seems pretty solid, brother.

59:33.043 --> 59:37.340
- Name for me please some
non-extradition countries.

59:45.188 --> 59:48.151
- I'm not sure, but I feel
pretty good about Venezuela

59:48.219 --> 59:51.590
or Vancouver,
definitely a V country.

59:51.659 --> 59:53.226
Maybe the Vatican?

59:53.294 --> 59:56.163
- How is it that you don't know
Vancouver is not a country?

59:56.231 --> 59:58.296
- They didn't actually teach
geography at my school,

59:58.365 --> 1:00:01.265
and I'm a little sensitive
about it, to be honest.

1:00:03.171 --> 1:00:07.436
- Mia, you've been
awfully quiet. Any ideas?

1:00:08.639 --> 1:00:11.480
- You think I'd walk outta here
and leave you to kill Barry?

1:00:11.549 --> 1:00:14.350
- Well, we told him not to come.

1:00:14.418 --> 1:00:15.944
How is this my fault?

1:00:16.013 --> 1:00:17.380
- It's moot anyway.

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:20.617
Ben's gonna be back soon
and he's gonna end this.

1:00:20.686 --> 1:00:21.725
- Ben.

1:00:26.399 --> 1:00:28.490
Ben has only ever let you down.

1:00:29.427 --> 1:00:31.966
I promise you, he's
not gonna change today.

1:00:35.474 --> 1:00:37.873
Fine. You guys can all just die.

1:00:37.942 --> 1:00:40.410
- Well, hang on. I,
I can live like that.

1:00:40.479 --> 1:00:42.107
And she didn't have the duck.

1:00:42.176 --> 1:00:43.910
It doesn't count if she
didn't have the duck.

1:00:43.979 --> 1:00:45.908
And I thought of
another one, Indonesia.

1:00:45.977 --> 1:00:47.311
You could learn to surf.

1:00:48.418 --> 1:00:49.952
Dammit, lady.

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:52.754
I mean, I respect the
balls and all, but come on.

1:00:52.822 --> 1:00:55.887
Barry's old, he's
had a good life.

1:00:55.956 --> 1:00:57.627
- Barry's had a terrible life.

1:00:57.696 --> 1:01:00.094
Barry's mostly duct
tape and rebar.

1:01:00.162 --> 1:01:02.926
- See, all the more
reason. He's ready to go.

1:01:02.994 --> 1:01:04.530
- Barry wants to live.

1:01:04.599 --> 1:01:05.802
- Dammit, Barry.

1:01:06.702 --> 1:01:08.201
- What did you see, Barry?

1:01:09.304 --> 1:01:12.140
- I saw the death of
someone's life in your closet.

1:01:12.209 --> 1:01:13.040
- What?

1:01:19.415 --> 1:01:20.344
Barry.

1:01:21.417 --> 1:01:22.383
Barry.

1:01:22.452 --> 1:01:24.086
- Hmm?

1:01:24.155 --> 1:01:25.451
- Those aren't real handcuffs.
There's a safety release.

1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:26.350
- Hmm?

1:01:27.226 --> 1:01:28.154
- Chicks, man.

1:01:30.889 --> 1:01:31.927
Am I right?

1:01:34.766 --> 1:01:37.328
How did you put up
with her all that time?

1:01:38.938 --> 1:01:40.632
I guess maybe cheating
on her constantly helped,

1:01:40.701 --> 1:01:41.739
I don't know.

1:01:43.770 --> 1:01:44.742
You wanna smoke?

1:01:46.837 --> 1:01:47.844
No?

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:52.312
Yeah, good call, they're
bad for your health.

1:01:52.380 --> 1:01:57.282
You see what I did
there? 'Cause you're dead.

1:01:58.850 --> 1:02:02.386
Man, your sense of humor just
went to shit after you died.

1:02:05.529 --> 1:02:06.390
No, you're right.

1:02:08.097 --> 1:02:10.394
Of course you are.
I gotta talk to her.

1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:15.267
I can't leave it like this
with her all mad at me.

1:02:17.339 --> 1:02:21.271
You know, you're a shitty
comedian since you died, right?

1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:24.408
But you are a damn
fine listener.

1:02:26.613 --> 1:02:32.020
Okay, well, let's
get you back in your closet.

1:02:41.593 --> 1:02:44.796
Okay guys, I think we got
a little off track here,

1:02:44.865 --> 1:02:46.963
and I blame myself.

1:02:47.032 --> 1:02:48.201
What are you doing?

1:02:51.276 --> 1:02:52.073
Wait.

1:02:53.574 --> 1:02:54.438
Where's?

1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:03.579
- All of your nervous
system are now belong to us.

1:03:11.529 --> 1:03:13.923
You're too violent, man.

1:03:16.561 --> 1:03:19.401
- No. What did you
do? What did you do?

1:03:20.966 --> 1:03:21.732
- Tie him up!

1:03:21.801 --> 1:03:22.840
- No!

1:03:23.538 --> 1:03:24.741
No!

1:03:24.809 --> 1:03:28.104
- Barry! Barry!
Fuck!

1:03:28.172 --> 1:03:30.144
I can't feel my face.

1:03:37.082 --> 1:03:38.856
- Garrett, stop it!

1:04:15.187 --> 1:04:17.521
- I better go talk to him.

1:04:21.197 --> 1:04:25.232
Hey, little kid. Little
kid, hold up. Hold up.

1:04:28.266 --> 1:04:29.565
Did you wanna come inside?

1:04:29.634 --> 1:04:32.239
We are having a
great time in there.

1:04:32.307 --> 1:04:34.604
We've got cake inside.
It's monkey cake.

1:04:35.646 --> 1:04:37.246
- I have to get home.

1:04:37.315 --> 1:04:39.048
- Hey, your mom's not gonna
care, just let's,

1:04:41.746 --> 1:04:43.312
let's go inside and
give her a call, okay?

1:04:43.381 --> 1:04:46.050
Come on. Let's go, sweet pea.

1:04:46.119 --> 1:04:48.552
Just give her a,

1:04:51.296 --> 1:04:52.127
Ah.

1:04:53.558 --> 1:04:56.560
We're
making pie inside.

1:04:58.635 --> 1:05:00.166
It's cherry pie.

1:05:00.235 --> 1:05:02.705
Look, and we're
playing paintball.

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:07.576
It's a
blast man, come on.

1:05:07.645 --> 1:05:08.638
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:05:09.743 --> 1:05:10.577
Come on.

1:05:11.513 --> 1:05:14.317
Listen, I need to get inside.
- Help, help. Let go.

1:05:14.386 --> 1:05:15.216
- Hey!

1:05:17.088 --> 1:05:19.583
- Nothing, nothing
weird going on here.

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:22.058
We're fine.

1:05:29.029 --> 1:05:31.001
Shut that fucking door!

1:05:31.069 --> 1:05:34.466
I still have the gun.
Remember the gun?

1:05:40.545 --> 1:05:42.940
Hey.

1:06:13.744 --> 1:06:15.111
- What just happened?

1:06:15.179 --> 1:06:17.711
- I think he's Al Qaeda
or Taliban, maybe Cobra.

1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:18.814
I don't know.

1:06:18.883 --> 1:06:20.545
- No one is gonna hurt you.

1:06:20.614 --> 1:06:23.020
I promise, everything
is gonna be just fine.

1:06:57.721 --> 1:06:58.721
- Holy shit.

1:06:58.790 --> 1:07:00.353
- You just hit that lady.

1:07:00.422 --> 1:07:02.792
- She just, she
came out of nowhere.

1:07:02.861 --> 1:07:04.326
- No, no, she was on the lawn

1:07:04.394 --> 1:07:06.690
and then you drove up on
the lawn and you hit her.

1:07:09.664 --> 1:07:13.130
- I know, it's
crazy, right? Who does that?

1:07:13.199 --> 1:07:15.798
Listen, call the police.

1:07:15.867 --> 1:07:18.405
I think I have a first
aid kit in my trunk.

1:07:20.779 --> 1:07:23.443
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

1:07:23.511 --> 1:07:26.313
Oh holy sugar. Okay,
this isn't the good.

1:07:26.382 --> 1:07:27.750
- Think she'll need
the first aid kit?

1:07:27.819 --> 1:07:28.783
- I don't know, I think--

1:07:30.617 --> 1:07:33.717

- We need to have
a conversation.

1:12:28.152 --> 1:12:31.652
- No. No!

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:39.429
- I wanted to tell you,
just before you die,

1:12:41.796 --> 1:12:43.797
I want you to know
you deserve this.

1:12:44.767 --> 1:12:46.027
'Cause other people,
they probably didn't,

1:12:46.096 --> 1:12:47.965
but you killed
them just the same.

1:12:49.935 --> 1:12:53.102
I hope you know
you're a murderer.

1:12:56.507 --> 1:12:57.742
- No, no.

1:12:57.811 --> 1:13:01.649
- You know, still,
I forgive you.

1:13:17.928 --> 1:13:19.828
- Why are you doing all this?

1:13:19.897 --> 1:13:23.132
- Why? You wanted a monster?

1:13:24.308 --> 1:13:26.069
Look at me, now you've got one.

1:13:26.904 --> 1:13:28.676
I'm gonna out-beast even you.

1:13:30.245 --> 1:13:31.910
Pay attention.

1:13:33.678 --> 1:13:35.078
This is where I begin.

1:13:36.820 --> 1:13:40.083
Oh, uh, you um, killed
your boyfriend, by the way.

1:13:43.191 --> 1:13:44.828
- Ben.

1:13:44.896 --> 1:13:46.129
Ben? Ben.

1:13:46.198 --> 1:13:48.663
- Oh, yeah you drowned him.

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:50.898
You're crazy.

1:13:50.967 --> 1:13:52.234
- What?

1:13:52.303 --> 1:13:56.968
- It's right here on page two.

1:13:59.744 --> 1:14:02.874
"It was just a lover's
quarrel that got out of hand,"

1:14:02.943 --> 1:14:06.109
because you are a
cheating asshole.

1:14:08.817 --> 1:14:11.146
"I didn't mean to
brain him to death

1:14:11.215 --> 1:14:16.625
with my metaphorical
abstract fucking rabbit.

1:14:17.828 --> 1:14:20.563
But I totally did, and now he's
dead and it's all my fault."

1:14:21.698 --> 1:14:23.462
Anyway, that's just
one of the drafts.

1:14:23.531 --> 1:14:25.963
I've got others. You see?

1:14:26.032 --> 1:14:29.472
Anyway, I told you that
you're the crazy one.

1:14:29.541 --> 1:14:32.241
- I thought
we were friends.

1:14:32.310 --> 1:14:35.341
- I thought we were in love.

1:14:35.410 --> 1:14:36.744
I thought we were...

1:14:40.282 --> 1:14:42.182
Any way, um.

1:14:45.987 --> 1:14:47.689
I'm gonna need your
John Hancock on this,

1:14:47.757 --> 1:14:52.126
just uh right here,
at the bottom, okay?

1:14:52.195 --> 1:14:56.064
- No!

1:14:56.133 --> 1:14:57.061
- Wait. No?

1:14:58.001 --> 1:14:58.833
Really?

1:15:00.070 --> 1:15:03.771
Okay, well you just killed the
girl that won't stop crying.

1:15:04.669 --> 1:15:05.707
You did that.

1:15:07.109 --> 1:15:08.439
- Oh no.

1:15:08.507 --> 1:15:09.744
- Oh, um,

1:15:12.747 --> 1:15:14.782
don't fall until
I get back, okay?

1:15:17.055 --> 1:15:18.181
Just a minute.

1:15:29.296 --> 1:15:30.263
Hey.

1:15:30.332 --> 1:15:32.199
- Whatcha doin'?

1:15:32.267 --> 1:15:33.498
- Shut up.

1:15:36.504 --> 1:15:38.134
Hey, you shut up too.

1:15:38.203 --> 1:15:41.376
- Don't worry, Poodle.
He's not gonna kill you.

1:15:41.445 --> 1:15:43.342
- Did you just call me Poodle?

1:15:43.411 --> 1:15:44.207
- Yes, I did.

1:15:46.144 --> 1:15:47.649
- Do you wanna
get back together?

1:15:47.718 --> 1:15:50.417
- Focus, lady. I'm
about to kill you.

1:15:50.486 --> 1:15:52.985
- He hasn't killed anyone.

1:15:53.922 --> 1:15:56.752
Even if he tried to kill
you, you'll be fine.

1:15:56.821 --> 1:15:58.154
If he were a newspaper,

1:15:58.223 --> 1:16:01.191
his permanent headline
would be "Fail."

1:16:01.260 --> 1:16:03.497
- There are two pretty
fucking dead people

1:16:03.566 --> 1:16:04.628
up in that hallway right now.

1:16:04.697 --> 1:16:05.728
I think they'd disagree.

1:16:05.797 --> 1:16:07.464
- Ah, I don't know.

1:16:07.533 --> 1:16:10.601
Probably you just found 'em
dead and brought 'em in here.

1:16:10.670 --> 1:16:11.736
- Found 'em dead?

1:16:11.805 --> 1:16:14.040
- Sure. People die all the time.

1:16:14.109 --> 1:16:17.078
Stands to reason you might
trip across one or two.

1:16:17.147 --> 1:16:22.116
I once knew a guy, died while
performing CPR on an old lady.

1:16:22.185 --> 1:16:22.982
Irony.

1:16:23.750 --> 1:16:25.648
- Well, what about Barry?

1:16:25.717 --> 1:16:26.887
Barry's dead.

1:16:28.325 --> 1:16:29.659
- I don't think so.

1:16:31.096 --> 1:16:32.488
Barry's old.

1:16:32.557 --> 1:16:35.197
He probably just needed a
nap after kicking your ass.

1:16:35.266 --> 1:16:37.130
- I kicked his ass.

1:16:37.198 --> 1:16:41.197
- Nah. You couldn't
even beat up an old man.

1:16:41.266 --> 1:16:44.069
There's no way you
could kill anyone.

1:16:45.402 --> 1:16:47.375
- You don't think
I can kill anyone?

1:16:47.443 --> 1:16:49.239
- Not a soul, sunbeam.

1:16:55.386 --> 1:16:57.251
- Let's find out together.

1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:14.664
- Oh, so we're taking a bath
now. That's a little weird.

1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:25.011
Ah, that is cold.

1:17:26.113 --> 1:17:30.081
Ah, this is cold.
This is cold water.

1:17:30.150 --> 1:17:34.356
If we could make that
warm. I'm very cold now.

1:17:40.258 --> 1:17:42.126
Whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:17:42.195 --> 1:17:45.165
Uh, see this is why you
need me on your side.

1:17:45.234 --> 1:17:49.137
That there's a GFCI outlet,
and it'll trip the circuit

1:17:49.206 --> 1:17:51.334
like a 30th of a second after
you toss that thing in here

1:17:51.403 --> 1:17:56.339
with me so, can't kill
me like that.

1:17:57.810 --> 1:17:58.880
- Let's find out.

1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:07.753
- Oh, fuck me running.

1:18:16.229 --> 1:18:21.265
Oh, worst 30th of a
second ever.

1:18:31.380 --> 1:18:32.210
What?

1:18:33.747 --> 1:18:35.378
Oh, oh shit. Geez.

1:18:43.123 --> 1:18:46.158
Oh shit, you're
gonna make me die.

1:18:47.228 --> 1:18:51.431
That's not very nice.
That's not very nice.

1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:56.068
- Ta-da.

1:18:56.137 --> 1:18:58.307
Have a good feeling this
is gonna be the one.

1:18:58.376 --> 1:19:00.271
- Oh, come on. Come on.

1:19:12.616 --> 1:19:18.025
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.163
Not the fucking blender again.

1:20:04.067 --> 1:20:05.605
- There you are.

1:20:05.674 --> 1:20:07.202
Sorry that took so long.

1:20:07.271 --> 1:20:09.142
Pizza guy just didn't wanna die.

1:20:10.274 --> 1:20:11.547
So are you gonna
sign the letter,

1:20:11.616 --> 1:20:13.278
or should I kill someone else?

1:20:16.584 --> 1:20:17.414
Thank you.

1:20:18.685 --> 1:20:19.482
Okay.

1:20:58.592 --> 1:20:59.522
- Come.

1:23:06.050 --> 1:23:07.387
Hey, kids?

1:23:08.490 --> 1:23:12.556
Oh, come on, let's play a little
game of duck, duck murder.

1:23:39.318 --> 1:23:41.684
- It'll break. It'll break.

1:23:43.825 --> 1:23:44.687
It'll break.

1:24:28.966 --> 1:24:30.935
- You know, you kinda have
to appreciate the irony

1:24:31.004 --> 1:24:32.372
in all this.

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:34.571
You came here to make
sure I didn't die,

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:37.245
and here I am making
sure that you do.

1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:42.415
I mean, maybe that's not
irony, but it is something.

1:24:43.683 --> 1:24:46.853
We could ask your
boyfriend, maybe he'd know.

1:24:46.922 --> 1:24:49.224
Oh, you know what?

1:24:49.292 --> 1:24:51.622
I kinda fried his ass
a few minutes ago.

1:25:10.612 --> 1:25:15.811
- It was, it was a GFCI outlet,
eh, can't kill me like that.

1:25:25.994 --> 1:25:27.823
- Okay. God, let's go.

1:25:29.630 --> 1:25:33.763
- How 'bout
just rest for a sec?

1:25:35.533 --> 1:25:36.839
- We gotta get you to a doctor.

1:25:36.908 --> 1:25:38.933
- Ah, don't worry about me.

1:25:40.272 --> 1:25:41.804
Go get Abi. Get Abi.

1:25:43.879 --> 1:25:45.647
- Okay. Okay.

1:25:45.716 --> 1:25:46.848
Okay.
- Yeah.

1:25:46.917 --> 1:25:48.580
You wanna take my blender?

1:25:49.984 --> 1:25:50.879
- I'm good.

1:25:54.019 --> 1:25:55.522
- Okay.

1:25:55.591 --> 1:26:00.460
There's a, you
got a bicycle chain on the,

1:26:02.865 --> 1:26:04.695
oh shit, oh.

1:26:06.095 --> 1:26:09.568
Don't worry, dude. We're
gonna get you outta here.

1:26:14.975 --> 1:26:16.538
Whoo.

1:26:16.607 --> 1:26:17.671
- Did you actually come up here

1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:19.545
thinking there was a way out?

1:26:20.510 --> 1:26:21.816
Yeah, there's not.

1:26:21.885 --> 1:26:23.517
There's no way out.

1:26:23.586 --> 1:26:27.656
No hope for you and all
your tears.

1:26:27.725 --> 1:26:28.785
I can, wait.

1:26:32.223 --> 1:26:36.861
Yeah, you know, it's just you
and me and death makes three.

1:26:37.864 --> 1:26:40.434
Also that little crippled
kid with the glasses.

1:26:57.587 --> 1:27:01.356
I swear, I don't know why I put
off killing you for so long.

1:27:01.425 --> 1:27:04.991
Killing you is gonna
be the most fun since,

1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:06.889
well, probably ever.

1:27:46.266 --> 1:27:47.930
You guys are the worst.

1:28:00.444 --> 1:28:01.548
- You guys okay?

1:28:05.351 --> 1:28:06.586
- I've been better.

1:28:09.386 --> 1:28:11.723
Oh, them.

1:28:12.422 --> 1:28:13.790
Of course.

1:28:13.859 --> 1:28:16.365
Of course you wouldn't
be asking how I'm doing.

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.499
- Drop the shovel.

1:28:19.132 --> 1:28:20.366
- Or what?

1:28:20.435 --> 1:28:22.296
Ow, ow!

1:28:22.365 --> 1:28:23.704
Ah!

1:28:23.773 --> 1:28:24.840
Ah!

1:28:31.044 --> 1:28:33.744
- I'm gonna sleep in your
skin tonight, like a tauntaun.

1:28:37.952 --> 1:28:38.783
Ah! Uh.

1:28:49.129 --> 1:28:49.959
What now?

1:28:52.366 --> 1:28:53.864
- I'll think of something.

1:28:57.006 --> 1:28:57.802
And it'll hurt.

1:29:08.085 --> 1:29:10.181
- This is all your fault.

1:29:10.250 --> 1:29:13.822
All this chaos,

1:29:13.891 --> 1:29:14.720
all the death,

1:29:15.959 --> 1:29:16.821
this is on you.

1:29:49.990 --> 1:29:52.455
- You got a little something
right, one right here.

1:29:52.524 --> 1:29:53.590
Let me get that for you.

1:31:36.697 --> 1:31:38.897
- I'm gonna need
you to sign this.

- Who just bombs in here,
starts killing folk,

1:32:05.057 --> 1:32:07.089
and even brings a few
of his own dead people,

1:32:07.158 --> 1:32:09.029
like a, like a bag
lunch or something?

1:32:09.098 --> 1:32:12.167
I'm like, "Stop killing folk.
They, they don't like that.

1:32:12.235 --> 1:32:13.602
You know, just stop."

1:32:13.670 --> 1:32:16.601
And then he, he axes
himself in the face.

1:32:16.670 --> 1:32:18.206
- And then he hung himself.

1:32:18.274 --> 1:32:20.307
- Right. Right after.

1:32:20.376 --> 1:32:22.002
- Shame.
- Yeah.

1:32:22.071 --> 1:32:24.175
- Why the ax and the hanging?

1:32:24.244 --> 1:32:27.141
Um, well, I guess he believed
that anything worth doing

1:32:27.209 --> 1:32:30.346
was worth doing
right.

1:32:30.415 --> 1:32:31.851
Hm.

1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:34.249
- Well, we were having
a peanut butter party,

1:32:34.317 --> 1:32:37.653
and he just showed up, I
didn't even invite him.

1:32:37.722 --> 1:32:39.289
Terrible manners.

1:32:39.357 --> 1:32:41.323
- Yeah, I mean mayonnaise
party, go ahead and just,

1:32:41.392 --> 1:32:44.594
you know, uninvited, that's
fine, but peanut butter.

1:32:44.663 --> 1:32:45.627
- Not peanut butter.

1:32:45.695 --> 1:32:46.734
- Huh-uh.

1:32:49.035 --> 1:32:51.873
- Fuckin' terrorist,
man. They're everywhere.

1:32:51.941 --> 1:32:55.439
- This one was when he tried
to make me eat chicken.

1:32:55.507 --> 1:32:56.337
I'm vegan.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:59.280
- They hate our
freedom, you know.

1:32:59.349 --> 1:33:00.714
- Drown guy in the closet?

1:33:00.783 --> 1:33:03.918
There was a drown guy
in the closet.

1:33:03.987 --> 1:33:06.285
Well, they say it only takes
like a teaspoon of water,

1:33:06.354 --> 1:33:07.454
don't they?

1:33:07.523 --> 1:33:08.888
Yeah.
- True story.

1:33:08.956 --> 1:33:11.224
- I mean, you'd have to
be a total retard, but--

1:33:11.293 --> 1:33:12.327
- It can happen.

1:33:12.396 --> 1:33:15.092
- Yeah, he is missing teeth.

1:33:16.497 --> 1:33:18.634
Gingivitis is a bitch.

1:33:19.436 --> 1:33:20.630
- I just assumed he was British.

1:33:20.699 --> 1:33:22.468
- Hm, he was very pale.

1:33:22.537 --> 1:33:25.038
- Hm.
- And stiff.

1:33:25.107 --> 1:33:26.101
- Yeah.

1:33:26.169 --> 1:33:27.973
- Could've been
the rigor mortis.

1:33:29.707 --> 1:33:31.475
- It's a rabbit.

1:33:31.544 --> 1:33:32.476
- Riga-what?

1:33:32.545 --> 1:33:33.345
- Riga-who?

1:33:33.414 --> 1:33:34.515
- Riga-please.

1:33:34.583 --> 1:33:35.480
- We're starting
a hip hop group.

1:33:36.614 --> 1:33:37.653
Holla.

1:33:39.651 --> 1:33:40.517
- We're not.

1:33:40.585 --> 1:33:43.091
- We are.

1:33:43.159 --> 1:33:43.718
- We are.
