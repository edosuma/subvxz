19:02.999 --> 19:06.999
So, wait-- is there any update
on Scott?

19:06.999 --> 19:09.999
>> KOURTNEY: No, Joe just said,
"Oh, my God, you'll die when you

19:09.999 --> 19:12.999
hear this story."
And then I, he said, "Call me."

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
But I called and he didn't
answer.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999

could you not call?"

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999

People keep telling me that
Scott has gone out of town, but,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.999
like, at this point, there's
really nothing that I could hear

19:29.999 --> 19:33.999

I've heard.

19:33.999 --> 19:36.999

vacation, and not spend it

19:36.999 --> 19:41.999

to, because at this point it

19:41.999 --> 19:44.999

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999

can legally drink right now on

19:55.999 --> 20:00.999

20:00.999 --> 20:03.999

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999

nails on Saturday.

39:11.999 --> 39:14.999
>> KRIS: You look beautiful.
>> KHLOE: So do you.

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
>> MASON: KoKo!
>> KHLOE: Uh, who said that?

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
>> KRIS: Merman.
>> KHLOE: Is there a merman

39:18.999 --> 39:21.999
in...? Oh!
>> KRIS: There's a merman.

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
>> KHLOE: Oh, I see you.
I had no idea who said that.

39:25.999 --> 39:29.999
>> KENDALL: I've never had one.
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

39:29.999 --> 39:32.999
>> KHLOE: Is that chicken?
>> KOURTNEY: This is so good.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
I cannot wait, guys, for the
crepes.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
>> KENDALL: Remember that crepe
place we used to go to in

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
Mammoth, Kylie?
>> KYLIE: Um, I've never had a

39:39.999 --> 39:42.999
crepe until, like, this year.
>> KOURTNEY: Where's Tyga?

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
>> KRIS: Over there.
>> KYLIE: Where is he, Mom?

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
>> KOURTNEY: He's like, "I
cannot sit with these crazy

39:47.999 --> 39:50.000
people anymore."
>> KYLIE: I'm gonna bring this

39:50.000 --> 39:54.999
to T right now.
(indistinct chatter)

39:54.999 --> 39:58.999
>> KHLOE: Oh, really?
>> KOURTNEY: I'm just saying

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
it's a lot to handle.
>> KRIS: So, wait, Kim?

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
>> KIM: Yeah?
>> KRIS: What day are you moving

40:03.999 --> 40:06.999
out?
>> KIM: Is this for real?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
(Kris laughs)
>> KRIS: Just kidding.

40:08.999 --> 40:11.999
>> KIM: No, tell me.
I would just go to a hotel.

40:11.999 --> 40:14.999
>> KOURTNEY: When I was hotel
hopping, it was so fun.

40:14.999 --> 40:18.999
>> KRIS: Do not egg her on.
I just wanted to see what she

40:18.999 --> 40:21.999
would say.
>> KIM: Till December.

40:21.999 --> 40:24.999
>> KRIS: To being roommates for
a really long time.

40:24.999 --> 40:27.999
>> KIM: You love it.
You get all your fashion

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
inspiration.
>> KRIS: I know.

40:29.999 --> 40:32.999
You're kind of like a dream come
true.

40:32.999 --> 40:35.999
And I love you.
>> KIM: And I love you, too.

40:35.999 --> 40:40.999
>> KRIS: Although Khloe is being
so strong, I know that she is

40:40.999 --> 40:46.999
hurting inside.
I can now see Kim's point of

40:46.999 --> 40:51.999
view a little bit about
giving Lamar Khloe's number.

40:51.999 --> 40:54.999
Because it does open up all
those wounds again.

40:54.999 --> 40:58.999
And so I'm just gonna do the
best I can to be there for her

40:58.999 --> 41:01.999
and not overstep my boundaries.
>> KOURTNEY: We were talking at

41:01.999 --> 41:04.999
lunch-- you weren't there--
about who would survive on a

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
deserted island out of all of
us.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
>> KHLOE: Who would?
>> KENDALL: We said you.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.999
>> KOURTNEY: They said me and
you.

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
>> KIM: I would bow out.
>> KRIS: I'm right behind her.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
I'm gonna carry her bags.
>> KYLIE: You guys don't

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
understand-- I'm a survivor.
>> KOURTNEY: I think Kylie would

41:16.999 --> 41:20.999
be the first down, and actually,
Ken, I may have to say you may

41:20.999 --> 41:24.999
not be a survivor.
>> KRIS: Oh, really?

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
♪ ♪

41:30.999 --> 41:33.999
>> KRIS: Her boobs are like two
pillows... right?

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
>> KHLOE: Kim's? They're huge.
>> KIM: Yeah, they're huge.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
>> KRIS: Yeah, they're
literally, they're bigger than

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
my little pillows that I have.
>> KIM: But what can I do?

41:39.999 --> 41:42.999
>> KRIS: Nothing.
>> KHLOE: They're ginormous.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
>> KIM: Seriously, what can I
do?

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
>> KRIS: How do your clothes
even fit?

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
>> KIM: They don't.
That's the problem.

41:48.999 --> 41:52.999
>> KOURTNEY: Ken, look.
I did investigating this morning

41:52.999 --> 41:56.000
and then I found this...
and this person and then they

41:56.000 --> 41:58.999
tagged all these people, so it
was, like, such a good

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
investigating morning.
>> KENDALL: Oh, wow.

42:00.999 --> 42:04.999
>> KHLOE: What?
I know, like, once you start

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
cyber-stalking someone,
constantly checking someone's

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
page, seeing if they posted
something new, you become

42:08.999 --> 42:10.999
addicted.
>> KOURTNEY: This guy we know.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
>> MASON: Mom?
>> KOURTNEY: And then

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
we were looking--
>> KYLIE: She did, she did

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
tag herself?
>> MASON: Mom?

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
>> KOURTNEY: No. Yes, Mace?
That random girl and then all

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
these people.
>> KHLOE: So for Kourtney to

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
just get so wrapped up in that,
I understand it.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
We've all been there.
But I want Kourtney to

42:26.999 --> 42:29.999
disconnect from that world for a
little bit, 'cause it becomes so

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
unhealthy.
>> KOURTNEY: I'm gonna go change

42:31.999 --> 42:34.999
so I'll be ready.
>> KRIS: I read something on

42:34.999 --> 42:37.999
Kourtney and Scott, so I threw
it away.

42:37.999 --> 42:39.999
She's just really insecure right
now.

42:39.999 --> 42:42.999
We have to be a little more
sensitive, because she is

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
sensitive, you know?
>> KIM: Yeah.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
>> KRIS: She's just kind of
living on her phone.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
She keeps, like, looking for
stuff, like--

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
>> KHLOE: I mean, it becomes,
like, obsessive.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
>> KIM: I see it happen all too
much.

42:52.999 --> 42:56.999
When so many people post things
on social media, I mean, you

42:56.999 --> 42:59.000
just know people are gonna send
it to Kourtney.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.999
So I think Scott kind of knows
what he's doing.

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
Every time Kourtney makes a move
to just, you know, kind of

43:04.999 --> 43:07.999
better herself, he does
something to get her attention.

43:07.999 --> 43:10.999
And that just makes me sad.
>> KHLOE: And then you get fed

43:10.999 --> 43:17.999
up, and you're, it's, then you
realize how toxic it is.

43:17.999 --> 43:21.999
>> KIM: On the next episode...
>> KHLOE: Kourtney can't be the

43:21.999 --> 43:26.999
only hot girl here.
That's amazing!

43:26.999 --> 43:28.999
>> KRIS: Do you see yourself
with somebody else?

43:28.999 --> 43:31.000
>> KOURTNEY: Not really.
>> KRIS: Do you think the one is

43:31.000 --> 43:33.999
Scott?
>> KOURTNEY: I did.

43:33.999 --> 43:36.000
>> KHLOE: You say, "Oh, I don't
have a family," and then we give

43:36.000 --> 43:38.999
you one.
Why do you, like, destroy it?

43:38.999 --> 43:40.999
>> SCOTT (crying): It's just
been a really hard time going

43:40.999 --> 43:42.999
from, like, having all of you
guys to having nobody.
