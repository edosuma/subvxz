00:00.067 --> 00:02.167
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s</i>
<i> game shows ruled the TV.</i>

00:02.169 --> 00:04.236
<i> There was</i> Pyramid,
Wheel of Fortune,

00:04.238 --> 00:05.704
Jeopardy!, <i> and</i>
The Newlywed Game.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.774
<i> But to us kids, none came</i>
<i> close to</i> Double Dare.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.309
<i> It was the world's</i>
<i> best game show,</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:13.045
<i> filled with trivia,</i>
<i> physical challenges,</i>

00:13.047 --> 00:13.979
<i> and host Marc Summers,</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:18.484
<i> who managed to smile even</i>
<i> when his nice suits got messy.</i>

00:18.486 --> 00:18.951
Idiots!

00:18.953 --> 00:20.986
The flag is under
the giant pad of butter!

00:20.988 --> 00:22.554
Always look
under the butter.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.622
If we ever get
on this show,

00:23.624 --> 00:24.757
imagine all the prizes
we'd win.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.226
We'd be strutting
around in our brand-new
British Knights,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.661
jammin' out to our
Panasonic portable
sound system,

00:29.663 --> 00:32.898
as we chow down
on a year's supply
of Chef Boyardee.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.601
It's all our dreams
wrapped into one.
(LAUGHS)

00:35.603 --> 00:38.337
<i> But the coolest part,</i>
<i> It was filmed in Philly,</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:39.571
<i> which meant one thing.</i>

00:39.573 --> 00:41.640
All right.
Shut your giggle holes.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.474
I have two announcements.

00:42.476 --> 00:47.312
First, whoever wrote
my phone number
in the boys' bathroom

00:47.314 --> 00:47.880
will be found.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.716
I called and asked
if his refrigerator
was running.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.218
It wasn't,
so it ended up
being sad.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.021
Second, some game show
called <i> Double Dare</i>

00:56.023 --> 00:57.456
is holding auditions
at our school,

00:57.458 --> 01:00.959
and two of you
will be picked to be
on their show.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.762
Now let's get those
bodies TV-ready.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.999
Dude, this is seriously
the best day of my life,

01:07.001 --> 01:09.435
and I once got mistaken
for Mary Lou Retton.

01:09.437 --> 01:09.968
Dorothy Hamill.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.470
We're actually gonna
be on <i> Double Dare.</i>

01:11.472 --> 01:14.773
You two so have
this in the bag.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.308
(LAUGHS)

01:16.310 --> 01:17.242
Bro, you don't
have a prayer.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.312
Shut up, Dave Kim.
This face was made for TV.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.147
But that voice...
Youch.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.551
You two can't compete
with Handsome Ben.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.652
ADULT ADAM: <i> He was right.</i>

01:26.654 --> 01:27.553
<i> We all had one growing up...</i>

01:27.555 --> 01:28.987
<i> The vicious rival</i>
<i> who always won.</i>

01:28.989 --> 01:31.290
Who always beats you out
for class president?
Handsome Ben.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.959
And who always gets
the lead in the musical?
Handsome Ben.

01:33.961 --> 01:38.297
Who was first in line
to see <i> Temple of Doom?</i>
Handsome Ben.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.999
You had to sit
in the second row,

01:41.001 --> 01:41.633
like a chump.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.536
Fine! You're right!
He wins every time.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.438
But this
will be different.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.439
Will it?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.373
Look at him.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.008
Hey, AG.
Hey, Dave Kim.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.445
Hi, Ben. (GIGGLES)
Hey, buddy.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.513
You're right.
He's amazing.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.448
My only real shot
is to win over the producers

01:56.450 --> 01:59.351
by picking a partner
that'll make me stand out.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.019
Perhaps someone like...

02:01.021 --> 02:02.154
"Cute Dave Kim."

02:02.156 --> 02:03.388
No one calls you that.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.823
I was thinking Pops.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.524
Your grandfather?

02:05.526 --> 02:09.461
Nothing wins people over more
than an adorable old man.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.130
Handsome Ben
is going down.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.398
Kid won't know
what hit him.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.468
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:20.939
<i> ¶ But nonetheless,</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:23.642
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:23.644 --> 02:27.546
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:27.548 --> 02:29.381
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was fall 1980-something,</i>

02:29.383 --> 02:31.283
<i> and Barry and my dad</i>
<i> were sitting down</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:32.618
<i> to what they did</i>
<i> every Sunday...</i>

02:32.620 --> 02:34.786
<i> Watch the Eagles...</i>
Go, baby, go,
baby, go!

02:34.788 --> 02:37.222
<i> ...for better or worse.</i>
Fumble? No!

02:37.224 --> 02:37.990
That's it.
Season's over.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.592
It's the first game
of the year.
They already blew it.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.360
We got to fire the coach

02:41.362 --> 02:42.528
and start thinking
about next year.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.597
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Whenever they'd watch,</i>
<i> my dad would turn on the team,</i>

02:45.599 --> 02:47.065
<i> while my brother</i>
<i> was hopelessly positive.</i>

02:47.067 --> 02:49.067
Look, all we need
is a turnover,
a touchdown,

02:49.069 --> 02:52.938
a 2-point conversion,
an onside kick,
and two more touchdowns.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.373
Or 12 safeties.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.674
Turn it off!
I can't take it anymore.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.645
<i> And they each handled</i>
<i> an Eagles loss</i>
<i> in their own special way.</i>

02:59.647 --> 03:01.146
Hey, buddy.
Got you a new
burger flipper.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.917
I noticed your
old spatula was
a little worse for wear.

03:04.919 --> 03:07.853
Look at you.
Always so damn nice, huh?

03:07.855 --> 03:08.754
Well, I'm sick of it.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.656
Lashing out because
the Eagles lost?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.590
And I'm sick
of your face.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.158
I'll just leave this
and go.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.928
I will kill you
with this spatula,

03:15.930 --> 03:17.763
you thoughtful,
thoughtful man!

03:17.765 --> 03:19.998
<i> As for my brother,</i>
<i> an Eagles loss meant</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:22.768
<i> several heartbroken days</i>
<i> of utter depression.</i>

03:22.770 --> 03:23.835
Hey. Hugh Hefner.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.070
Cover your
downstairs stuff.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.872
You're in school,
not the grotto.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.307
The Eagles lost.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.208
Ohhh.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.309
Take the day.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.212
Make room, everybody!
Eagles fan coming through!

03:33.214 --> 03:35.080
<i> Thankfully, a new week</i>
<i> meant a new chance</i>

03:35.082 --> 03:37.549
<i> for my dad and bro</i>
<i> to help the Eagles win...</i>

03:37.551 --> 03:40.252
<i> Through a series</i>
<i> of crazy superstitions.</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:41.019
Let's get this going.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.554
I got on my good-luck
jersey and underpants.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.090
Now time for some
pregame cabbage
patching

03:45.092 --> 03:46.758
to supercharge
our good luck.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.659
<i> Even if the superstitions</i>

03:47.661 --> 03:49.461
<i> breached the boundary</i>
<i> of common sense.</i>

03:49.463 --> 03:51.430
Do it better!
The Eagles need us!

03:51.432 --> 03:52.764
<i> Or any sense at all.</i>

03:52.766 --> 03:54.499
Who wants some
double-cheesy nachos?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.735
Stop where you're at!
Mom, you know the rules!

03:56.737 --> 03:59.104
Once you step foot on the den
floor, the Eagles will lose.

03:59.106 --> 04:03.075
What happens in this house
has no impact on the game.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.409
That is adorable.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.210
I am not bad luck.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.012
Would you just stop
with this already?

04:07.014 --> 04:09.648
What happened the first
Sunday after we got married,

04:09.650 --> 04:12.017
when you insisted on
watching the game with me?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.720
They lost
by six stupid touchdowns.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.355
Just come and get
your nachos.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.089
Mom, you know the rules.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.858
Once the game starts,
we can't move
from our spot.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.726
Now truck it over
on the animal.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.762
ADULT ADAM:
<i> This '80s toy monster truck</i>
<i> was their typical lifeline,</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:27.199
<i> mostly due to its retractable</i>
<i> claws for stability.</i>

04:27.201 --> 04:28.166
(BOTH SIGH)

04:28.168 --> 04:29.935
The claws did nothing!

04:29.937 --> 04:30.836
Stay back!
Don't clean it up!

04:30.838 --> 04:33.238
There's hot cheese
on my rug!

04:33.240 --> 04:34.506
That's its home now!

04:34.508 --> 04:35.907
She jinxed us!

04:35.909 --> 04:37.743
Do your idiot dance!

04:40.314 --> 04:42.881
Pops,
I have amazing news!

04:42.883 --> 04:44.850
You're gonna be my partner
on <i> Double Dare!</i>

04:44.852 --> 04:47.252
That's the best news
I've heard all day.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.087
Also,
what's <i> Double Dare?</i>

04:49.089 --> 04:51.423
Only the country's
hottest game show.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.425
You love game shows,
right?

04:53.427 --> 04:53.892
You bet.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.895
That Vanna White
sure can turn a letter.

04:56.897 --> 04:57.396
Ha ha!

04:57.398 --> 04:59.831
Don't say any of that
at our audition.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.034
In fact, leave all
the talking to me.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.435
You sure
you don't want to do this

05:03.437 --> 05:04.936
with one of
your little friends?

05:04.938 --> 05:07.105
Nah. She'll understand.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.440
Ow! You punched me
in the heart!

05:08.442 --> 05:11.343
You're picking
your grandfather
over me? Seriously?

05:11.345 --> 05:13.812
You know it's been my dream
to go on <i> Double Dare.</i>

05:13.814 --> 05:16.548
It's selfish of you
not to support that.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.816
How am I
the weak link?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.217
You got flat feet
and a lazy eye.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.888
That <i> Double Dare</i>
human-hamster wheel
will eat you alive.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.889
I had no choice.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.690
This is the only way

05:24.692 --> 05:26.858
I can beat
my lifelong rival,
Handsome Ben.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.228
Dude, you're not his rival.
It's totally one-sided.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.097
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.465
Hey, Ben.

05:33.467 --> 05:33.932
'Sup, Adam?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.834
Good luck at the
<i> Double Dare</i> tryouts.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.035
I hope you get it.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.537
(CHUCKLES)

05:38.539 --> 05:40.972
Stupid, generous
Handsome Ben.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.007
Well, I don't need you.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.642
I'm gonna make it
on the show and win,

05:43.644 --> 05:46.745
and I won't save
any slime for you!

05:46.747 --> 05:49.014
Is that a new
trapper keeper, Adam?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.717
Sweet.
Just got it. Thanks.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.684
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

05:52.686 --> 05:53.585
I will bury you.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.022
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While I was plotting to beat</i>
<i> my lifelong rival,</i>

05:57.024 --> 06:00.025
<i> my mom had plotted a way</i>
<i> into the den.</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:01.193
What... What is this?
What are you doing?

06:01.195 --> 06:02.894
Don't worry.
I'm not touching
the floor.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.031
I'm just gonna bust some
dust and be on my way.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.833
(VACUUM CLEANER RUNNING)

06:07.835 --> 06:08.266
Poop!

06:08.268 --> 06:09.568
Bevy, please! Come on!
Dear lord, no!

06:09.570 --> 06:12.237
<i> And then</i>
<i> something crazy happened.</i>

06:12.239 --> 06:12.904
Oh!
(SCREAMING)

06:12.906 --> 06:15.907
<i> The Eagles intercepted</i>
<i> the moment</i>
<i> my mom stepped on the floor.</i>

06:15.909 --> 06:17.109
<i> And as soon as she left...</i>

06:17.111 --> 06:19.177
Come on!
Are you kidding?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.479
<i> ...the Eagles fumbled.</i>

06:20.481 --> 06:22.914
Dude.
Did you see that?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.217
When mom was in here,
the Eagles kicked butt.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.386
The second she left,
the Eagles sucked butt.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.053
What are you saying?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.755
Do you think
mom's good luck?

06:29.757 --> 06:32.290
No. It's just
a dumb coincidence.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.326
Only one way
to find out.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.428
Kee-ya!
What the hell!

06:36.430 --> 06:37.229
Shut up. Shut up.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.631
Mom! I think
dad spilled something!

06:39.633 --> 06:41.199
Hey, hey!

06:41.869 --> 06:43.301
It's okay.
I've always got a rag.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.669
It's a mom secret.
(CHUCKLES)

06:44.671 --> 06:46.972
(CROWD CHEERING)
They sacked Bradshaw.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.507
Get it! Get it! get it!

06:48.509 --> 06:49.374
<i> ...and they did.</i>

06:49.376 --> 06:50.342
Good god, mom did it!

06:50.344 --> 06:52.544
No! That was
just another coincidence.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.913
You keep your mother
out of this. Understand?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.548
Understand what?
I heard "mother."

06:56.550 --> 06:57.315
I'm the mother.
Here I am.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.152
Dude, all these years,
we've got it wrong.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.953
You're not a jinx.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.223
You're like a real,
actual lucky charm.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.324
Thank you, schmoo.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.225
No. Stop.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.794
There's no such thing
as actual luck.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.029
Then why are you wearing your
lucky jersey and underpants?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.198
This helps the Eagles win,
not your mother.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.202
Looks like those greeny guys
are celebrating something.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.236
They scored!

07:18.238 --> 07:19.938
Mom stays...
Stays forever.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.141
Oh! Ha!
This is gonna be fun!

07:23.143 --> 07:25.110
Go, greeny birds!

07:25.112 --> 07:25.644
MURRAY: No.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.679
We have a system
when we watch football,

07:27.681 --> 07:30.649
and the number-one rule
of that system is no talking.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.185
ADULT ADAM: <i> Naturally,</i>
<i> my mom respected the rules...</i>

07:33.187 --> 07:34.853
<i> Until the next week,</i>
<i> when she didn't.</i>

07:34.855 --> 07:37.856
Are the players married
to the cheerleaders?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.357
Do you think
their families are mad

07:39.359 --> 07:40.425
'cause they work
on Sundays?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.260
Ugh! Look at
those grass stains.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.262
Who washes those pants?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.530
Aren't we all Patriots?

07:45.532 --> 07:47.265
Oh ho! Look at
that big, snuggly pileup.

07:47.267 --> 07:51.303
Why does the throwy guy
keep putting his hands
in the other guy's butt?

07:51.305 --> 07:53.638
I have a better name
for a team...

07:53.640 --> 07:55.073
The Yankee Doodles.

07:55.075 --> 07:55.607
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

07:55.609 --> 07:58.577
You know what?
Who wants bagel bites?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.445
'Cause I'm gonna
put some in the oven.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.447
What do I set it at?
2,000?

08:02.449 --> 08:03.748
No! Murray,
you know the rule.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.851
Don't touch any knobs
in the kitchen.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.554
Hey! Come back fast.
We need you on defense.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.289
Isn't this great?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.057
Woman's got to go.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.092
What? No! she's part
of the game ritual.

08:14.094 --> 08:14.926
There's no going back.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.995
A man needs time
away from his wife,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.464
and for me,
football is that time.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.566
So, what? You're just
gonna tell her to go away?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.101
You know mom.
It'll crush her.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.137
Don't worry.
I'll be sensitive.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.673
Hey, honey.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.309
Would you put that down
and get out?

08:31.311 --> 08:31.676
What?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.445
Listen, it's not
that I don't love

08:33.447 --> 08:34.913
spending every moment
with you,

08:34.915 --> 08:37.449
but you don't understand
football,

08:37.451 --> 08:38.316
and it's distracting.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.585
Well, that sounds
like an excuse.

08:40.587 --> 08:44.089
Okay, imagine if I go
to your scrapbook club

08:44.091 --> 08:44.890
and every few seconds,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.858
I interrupt you
with a question

08:46.860 --> 08:48.493
about what glitter
I should use.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.595
Well,
that would be ridiculous

08:50.597 --> 08:53.098
because there's opaque,
translucent, chunky,

08:53.100 --> 08:58.036
micro-fine, spray-on,
brush-on, squeeze-on...

08:58.038 --> 08:59.504
Oh.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.307
I get it.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.174
I'll go.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.175
That means a lot, Bevy.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.445
And that's
how you do marriage.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.781
<i> And so my mom got the message.</i>

09:09.783 --> 09:11.750
Teach me everything
about football.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.351
You've come
to the right place.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.620
<i> It was just the wrong message.</i>

09:17.691 --> 09:20.258
Let's start with the basics.
This is the quarterback.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.595
These are the linemen,
receivers, running back.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.129
Question...

09:24.131 --> 09:25.230
What do
all those words mean?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.533
Simplifying,
there's offense
and defense.

09:28.535 --> 09:32.203
Question... Are those things
I should already know?

09:32.205 --> 09:33.838
Simplifying...

09:33.840 --> 09:35.373
This is a football.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.141
Question...

09:36.143 --> 09:38.577
Is the plural of football
"feetball"?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.177
Ohh! God!

09:39.179 --> 09:42.514
Why won't anyone answer me?
What are you people hiding?

09:42.516 --> 09:44.082
My god. I can't
take this anymore.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.118
Look, there is only one way
to teach mom anything...

09:47.120 --> 09:49.588
Put it in terms
she understands.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.389
Okay,
this is a football,

09:51.391 --> 09:54.759
but I want you to imagine
it's actually me as a baby.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.094
Aww!

09:56.096 --> 09:56.828
(GASPS) ooh!

09:56.830 --> 10:00.332
Now, your job is to protect
that baby at all costs.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.866
Of course.

10:01.868 --> 10:02.367
Who are they?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.469
Hi, Erica! You called,
and I came right away.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.203
Isn't that nice of me?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.738
As you can see,
they're the enemy.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.373
We call them
the defensive line.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.207
Their job is to stop you.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.577
Translation... They're a band
of evil college recruiters,

10:12.579 --> 10:15.046
wanting to take
your precious
little girl away

10:15.048 --> 10:18.083
to an out-of-state
university.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.452
But that's too far.
How will I see you every day?

10:20.454 --> 10:22.053
You've only
got one choice...

10:22.055 --> 10:24.289
Get that baby
back to our house.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.390
Or the end zone.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.692
(CLEARS THROAT)
Please move.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.927
No way.
Please move!

10:28.929 --> 10:31.296
Oh, we're comin' for you.
Gimme that baby!

10:31.298 --> 10:32.764
Never!
Hike!

10:32.766 --> 10:34.399
Go! Go!
Oh.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.335
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

10:37.337 --> 10:38.370
Whoo!

10:38.372 --> 10:39.437
(LAUGHS)

10:39.439 --> 10:40.905
I made it home!

10:40.907 --> 10:42.107
I made it home.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.842
Or the end zone.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.744
Oh! I get it!

10:45.746 --> 10:47.112
Come on, guys.
Where's the "D"?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.513
I just don't know
where to touch her.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.981
Maybe I should
just cover Erica.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.383
I hate you so much,
Geoff.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.118
Shut it, okay?
It's enough.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.886
<i> While my mom</i>
<i> was ready for game day,</i>

10:54.888 --> 10:56.888
<i> I was ready</i>
<i> for my game-show debut.</i>

10:56.890 --> 10:59.491
Hi, kids. I'm Zane,
and this is Ellen.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.793
We've set up
a practice course

11:01.795 --> 11:04.362
to simulate
actual <i> Double Dare.</i>

11:04.364 --> 11:05.530
Now pick a partner.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.966
That's right.
Let's get messy!

11:07.968 --> 11:10.969
<i> Yep, I knew exactly</i>
<i> how to wow the producers.</i>

11:10.971 --> 11:14.372
<i> Three words...</i>
<i> Make an entrance.</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:15.140
Sorry we're late.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.976
Me and my best friend
got held up on the public bus.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.079
No way. You can't
pick a cute old man.

11:21.081 --> 11:21.913
That's not fair.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.249
Sorry, sister...
Not against the rules.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.151
I checked.
(ALL GROAN)

11:26.153 --> 11:29.554
What kind of
a farkakte game
show is this?

11:29.556 --> 11:30.722
I thought
it was just trivia.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.591
Oh, it is.
And some physical
challenges.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.127
It looks slimy
and unsafe.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.296
You're Pops!
You can do anything!

11:38.298 --> 11:40.165
What the (BLEEP)
is that thing?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.233
You play tennis
and date twins

11:42.235 --> 11:44.402
and drink martinis
when the sun's out.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.338
Yes, I do sample from
the salad bar of life.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.973
Then let's show 'em
what we're made of.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.609
(GRUNTING)
Go, go, go!
You got it.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.812
I can't find
the damn flag.

11:53.814 --> 11:54.746
Look under
the pad of butter!

11:54.748 --> 11:56.681
They always hide it
under the pad of butter!

11:56.683 --> 11:59.884
Aw,
there's no flag here!

12:00.687 --> 12:01.219
(GRUNTING)

12:01.221 --> 12:04.155
This is
my good tracksuit!

12:04.157 --> 12:06.024
(GROANS)

12:06.460 --> 12:07.859
Why am I here?

12:07.861 --> 12:10.462
Oh, no, no!

12:10.464 --> 12:11.396
(GROANS)

12:11.398 --> 12:13.465
This is not
a game show!

12:13.467 --> 12:15.066
Faster!
(GROANS)

12:15.068 --> 12:16.101
Po... (SIGHS)

12:16.103 --> 12:18.803
I'm not a hamster!
I'm a human man!

12:18.805 --> 12:22.307
That...
Did not go well.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.308
No, it did not.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.043
I'm sorry
I let you down, kiddo.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.612
I'm gonna dig my watch
out of the butter and leave.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.949
Well, how'd it go
with your adorable
best friend?

12:30.951 --> 12:31.983
Great. So great.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.885
Listen,
I was thinking...

12:33.887 --> 12:36.187
Our friendship
is too important.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.922
We should be partners.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.790
I don't think so.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.425
See, I already got
a partner.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.461
You ready to rock,
muscles?

12:43.830 --> 12:44.462
Seriously?

12:44.464 --> 12:47.265
Of all the people,
you ditch me for that putz?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.299
Now you know
how it feels.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.636
Well, we'll see how you feel
when Handsome Ben chokes.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.139
He's got the looks,
but not the chops.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.039
(LAUGHS) done.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.609
And I got
the course record, too.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.411
Balls!

13:00.413 --> 13:02.747
That is one hard schnoz.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.983
<i> As I was losing</i>
<i> a best friend...</i>

13:04.985 --> 13:05.683
Set...hike!

13:05.685 --> 13:09.120
<i> ...my mom was learning</i>
<i> how to win at feetball.</i>

13:12.092 --> 13:13.992
(LAUGHING)
Touchdown!

13:13.994 --> 13:15.426
Whoo!

13:15.428 --> 13:16.361
Oh, yeah!

13:16.363 --> 13:17.262
You're in my house now!

13:17.264 --> 13:21.900
You're gonna come in
and take off your shoes
'cause I just vacuumed.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.135
That's how "in my house"
you are!

13:24.137 --> 13:24.569
Whoo!

13:24.571 --> 13:26.171
I think our work
here is done.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.808
I have a feeling your dad
is gonna be a very happy man!

13:29.810 --> 13:31.976
BEVERLY:
Let's go, Eagles "D"!

13:31.978 --> 13:32.944
Sack!
BARRY: Yes!

13:32.946 --> 13:34.412
(LAUGHS)
Yes, baby.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.749
<i> Turns out learning football</i>
<i> just ruined it for my dad.</i>

13:37.751 --> 13:39.150
Isn't this great?

13:39.152 --> 13:39.818
Mur,
you got it all.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.853
Yeah, she did
the thing I asked her to do,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.521
so it'd be wrong of me
to complain.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.257
Watch... Next play, they're
gonna throw the long ball.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.492
That's nuts.
It's third and short.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.660
They're gonna go
up the middle.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.261
No. They're expecting
the rush.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.731
Gah! Stop saying things
with sports-fueled knowledge!

13:53.733 --> 13:55.333
Let's all just not talk
until the Eagles win, okay?

13:55.335 --> 14:00.071
<i> Unfortunately for my dad,</i>
<i> they really were</i>
<i> expecting the rush.</i>

14:00.073 --> 14:02.240
Boom! Ha ha!

14:02.242 --> 14:03.141
Who called it?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.343
Mama bird... That's who!

14:05.345 --> 14:06.177
Face!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.812
Aah! That's it!

14:07.814 --> 14:09.380
You got to go.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.882
Go?

14:10.884 --> 14:11.316
But...

14:11.318 --> 14:14.819
I learned football.
(CHUCKLING)
I did what you said.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.154
Thing is, I lied.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.824
Look, I think the key to
a good marriage is time apart,

14:19.826 --> 14:22.193
and for me,
football is that time.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.395
Well, I think the key
to a good marriage

14:24.397 --> 14:26.698
is spending time
together.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.134
But if you don't
want me here...

14:30.136 --> 14:31.803
I'll go.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.906
<i> While my</i> Double Dare
<i> dreams had been dashed,</i>

14:34.908 --> 14:36.608
<i> Emmy's were looking</i>
<i> better than ever,</i>

14:36.610 --> 14:39.844
<i> thanks to athletic, horrible</i>
<i> Handsome Ben.</i>

14:39.846 --> 14:41.246
Look at Handsome Ben go.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.248
His feet barely
touch the slime.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.783
I feel like
it's right...

14:45.785 --> 14:46.384
Here.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.519
Yes!
Yes! Got it! come on.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.721
Well done,
kids!

14:49.723 --> 14:51.723
Looks like you two
are the team to beat.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.325
Couldn't ask
for a better partner.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.293
(CHUCKLES)

14:55.295 --> 14:57.896
I think that was
directed at you.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.530
Yes!
Thank you, Dave Kim.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.634
Looks like all of
those months of
practice with Emmy

15:02.636 --> 15:04.235
really paid off.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.271
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Months?

15:06.273 --> 15:09.340
Yeah, we overheard
Coach Mellor at
the beginning of the year

15:09.342 --> 15:10.508
saying <i> Double Dare</i>
was coming.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.411
That's when we agreed
to partner up and...
Pbht! What?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.213
Handsome Ben's
just confused.

15:15.215 --> 15:15.980
Let me get this
straight.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.016
You picked him
before I even asked you?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.585
Kinda.
You've been torturing
me for a week,

15:20.587 --> 15:22.253
and you did
the exact same thing!

15:22.255 --> 15:24.622
I was at least gonna lie
and let you down easy.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.657
Well, you make
a great team...

15:25.659 --> 15:28.192
Handsome Ben and
"sack of crap" Emmy.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.061
Take it back, nerd!

15:30.363 --> 15:31.663
ADULT ADAM: <i> Sure, it was</i>
<i> an honest accident.</i>

15:31.665 --> 15:33.765
<i> However,</i>
<i> what happened next wasn't.</i>

15:33.767 --> 15:36.567
<i> After that,</i>
<i> no one was at their best.</i>

15:36.569 --> 15:38.236
Whoa, whoa!

15:38.738 --> 15:40.204
Both of you... Out!

15:40.206 --> 15:41.239
But you said
I was a lock.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.442
That was before you made
a mess of this course.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.077
Now go.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.614
Thanks a lot.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.985
Well, looks like
you're gonna need
a new partner.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.753
For sure.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.488
Hey, Amy,
be my partner?

15:57.490 --> 16:00.224
Definitely.
You're handsome.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.529

Always a bridesmaid.

<i> My dad knew he needed</i>
<i> to make it right with my mom.</i>

16:10.770 --> 16:13.938
<i> Only problem...</i>
<i> He had no idea how.</i>

16:13.940 --> 16:15.707
(CLANKING)

16:15.709 --> 16:18.843
Time to cook
the steak-umms!

16:18.845 --> 16:20.244
Hope I don't make
a mess!

16:20.246 --> 16:22.547
Why are you narrating
your kitchen experience?

16:22.549 --> 16:25.283
I'm trying to lure
your mother downstairs.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.518
I don't know what's wrong.
This always works.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.220
Yeah, well, you really
hurt her feelings.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.456
You're a, uh,
lady person.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.156
How do I un-hurt them?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.926
Hello? Mom took an interest
in something you love.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.061
Just show her that you
can do the same thing.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.297
What... Like yakking
on the phone, shopping,

16:39.299 --> 16:42.500
or pushing the hot thing
over the clothes?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.468
Ironing?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.202
No, those are chores.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.604
I'm talking about stuff
that makes her happy,

16:46.606 --> 16:47.338
like jazzercise.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.607
That dancy thing
where she puts on
the stretchy clothes

16:49.609 --> 16:51.909
and rolls around
on the ground like
a drunk toddler?

16:51.911 --> 16:54.979
Good point. You should focus
on something more your speed.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.648
And by speed,
I mean no speed.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.217
I got it.

16:59.219 --> 16:59.817
Son of a bitch!

16:59.819 --> 17:02.320
This can't be done!
No one can do it!

17:02.322 --> 17:04.155
What exactly
are you doing?

17:04.157 --> 17:04.989
Scrapbooking...

17:04.991 --> 17:06.924
Your mother's
favorite hobby.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.426
But it's a nightmare!

17:08.428 --> 17:09.394
Stupid glue!

17:09.396 --> 17:11.429
Everything I touch
sticks to me!

17:11.431 --> 17:12.597
Just calm down, okay?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.332
I'm sure what
you made is fine.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.567
(HORROR MUSIC PLAYS)

17:17.470 --> 17:19.404
Holy crap!
What is that?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.004
Our sweet memories.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.472
Why did you cut out
the letters?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.473
It looks like
a ransom note.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.642
You know I'm not good
at penmanship!

17:24.644 --> 17:25.343
Why'd you put "look"?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.712
What am I supposed
to look at...
His red demon eyes?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.480
I was trying to make them
sparkle with glitter,

17:29.482 --> 17:32.517
but no one tells you
how complicated
glitter is.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.620
It looks like something
a 10-year-old serial killer
would make.

17:35.622 --> 17:36.220
I know!

17:36.222 --> 17:39.757
Let me break this down for
you in terms you understand.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.194
Imagine this page
is the football field

17:43.196 --> 17:45.797
and this baby picture...
The quarterback.

17:49.769 --> 17:50.802
All right,
listen up.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.438
I just found out who got
picked for the game show

17:53.440 --> 17:56.541
that left all sorts of
stains on my gym floor.

17:56.543 --> 18:00.078
And our new TV stars are...

18:00.180 --> 18:02.780
...Handsome Ben
and Regular Amy.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.382
We're in! We did it!
Yes!

18:04.384 --> 18:05.016
Wait... What?

18:05.018 --> 18:06.784

<i> losing out on</i> Double Dare

18:06.786 --> 18:10.621

Hey.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.532
I'm not talking
to you, jackass.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.234
That should've been me.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.602
It should've been us.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.504
There is no us.

18:26.840 --> 18:31.342
Look, I don't blame
you for picking Ben
two months ago.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.810
He's not my rival.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.979
He's just amazing.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.115
I guess...

18:37.984 --> 18:39.684
I'm a jackass, too.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.785
Little bit.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.352
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

18:41.354 --> 18:44.055
So much for always
having each other's backs.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.424
I mean, <i> Double Dare</i>
tore us apart.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.825
So fast.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.828
Are we, like,
terrible best friends?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.396
Maybe.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.097
But if we are,

18:53.099 --> 18:55.466
I hope we're terrible
best friends forever.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.636
I'm talking graduation,
college, law school.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.038
Hell, I'm gonna be
the bro of honor
at your wedding.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.709
And when you're like 100
and at an old-age home,

19:04.711 --> 19:06.711
I'm gonna be watching
<i> Double Dare</i>

19:06.713 --> 19:08.045
right there
next to you.

19:08.047 --> 19:08.913
(CHUCKLES)

19:08.915 --> 19:11.249
You think
it'll still be on?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.184
Oh, for sure.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.987
I made you something.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.522
What is this?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.224
I know how hard you worked
learning my favorite thing,

19:20.226 --> 19:23.561
so I thought it was time
I learned about yours.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.463
<i> ¶ Stay with me</i>

19:25.465 --> 19:28.232
You made a scrapbook
for me?

19:28.234 --> 19:30.968
Pretty good, huh?
No. It's a train wreck.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.937
You glittered
where you should've laced,

19:32.939 --> 19:35.106
and you laced where
you should've stenciled.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.841
It's all so complicated!

19:36.843 --> 19:38.442
Doesn't matter.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.343
I love it.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.912
Look, I'm lucky
to have a wife

19:40.914 --> 19:43.714
who wants to spend time
with a man like me.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.449
So what do you say...

19:45.451 --> 19:48.553
Next time, I tag along
to your scrapbook club?

19:48.555 --> 19:49.987
You were right.

19:49.989 --> 19:53.157
Scrapbooking is
my time away.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.026
You just stick
with your feetball.

That's it.
Season's over.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.203
No, all we need's
a touchdown,

20:05.205 --> 20:06.470
an onside kick,
a field goal,

20:06.472 --> 20:07.939
and then
two more touchdowns.

20:07.941 --> 20:08.539
Stop it.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.274
Off to the craft store.
Be back in a jiff.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.542
