15:04.338 --> 15:05.858
and then my daughter
had a soccer game,

15:05.882 --> 15:07.082
so I missed all the commotion.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.057
All right, then.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.014
Please let us know if you
see or hear anything.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.146
Have a nice day.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
Thank you.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.327
There was a robbery in the area?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.024
Yes.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.200
Cool.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.530
[teammates cheering]

15:25.011 --> 15:27.274
Come on, Denise! Tie it up!
Come on!

15:30.016 --> 15:31.080
I mean, I was standing

15:31.104 --> 15:32.777
right next to him.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.778
Could you imagine?

15:33.802 --> 15:34.866
I mean, what if I'd seen

15:34.890 --> 15:36.476
or said something
I shouldn't have?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.740
Anything could have gone wrong.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.306
It sounds awful.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.941
It was.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.510
Don't you bank at
United Metro Trust?

15:47.772 --> 15:48.924
Yes, I do.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.906
Lucky you weren't
there then, too.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.257
Yeah, lucky.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.585
[cell phone chimes]

15:58.609 --> 16:00.979
Oh, look, Parsons is
putting Brook in.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.720
Come on, Brook!

16:02.744 --> 16:04.591
Come on, Brook!

16:04.615 --> 16:05.615
Over here!

16:07.227 --> 16:08.987
So did you get a
look at the guy?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.728
Of course I did.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.233
I gave the police a
full description.

16:16.105 --> 16:17.126
[cheering]

16:17.150 --> 16:19.891
[whistle blows]

16:21.067 --> 16:23.069
[cheering and clapping]

16:38.606 --> 16:40.486
I should have just kicked
the ball out of bounds

16:40.510 --> 16:42.281
in that last play.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.630
Honey, it was a tie game.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.284
It wasn't that bad.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.634
Yeah, but it could
have been a win.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.288
Don't be so hard on yourself.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.681
Yeah.

16:50.705 --> 16:51.987
Hey, honey...

16:52.011 --> 16:53.571
I forgot something,
so I'll be right in.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.292
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.369
[alarm chirps]

17:39.319 --> 17:40.798
Here.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.845
For a job well done.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.565
I don't want that.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.436
Save it for Kyle's debt.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.569
When someone tries
to help you, Anne,

17:52.593 --> 17:53.918
you should accept it.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.398
I did.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.226
And look where that got me.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.966
For 12 years,

17:58.990 --> 18:00.533
I gave my wife everything.

18:00.557 --> 18:01.534
I helped her with her family,

18:01.558 --> 18:02.579
her business.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.276
How does she thank me?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.235
She takes my son and leaves me.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.324
Loyalty, Anne.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.239
Don't be ungrateful.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.849
I'm trying to help you.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.069
If you want to help me...

18:14.093 --> 18:15.331
you want to help me?

18:15.355 --> 18:17.420
Don't let my son
play in your games.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.682
He's a grown man.

18:18.706 --> 18:19.770
He'll make his own decisions...

18:19.794 --> 18:20.814
And if it was your son,

18:20.838 --> 18:21.685
wouldn't you want someone

18:21.709 --> 18:23.034
to help him?

18:23.058 --> 18:24.427
Sure.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.125
But he'd just find another game.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.172
One that wouldn't give
him the opportunity

18:30.196 --> 18:32.478
to pay back his debts.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.958
I'm keeping an eye on him,

18:33.982 --> 18:35.090
for you.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.898
Understand?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.160
Good.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.975
So...

18:50.999 --> 18:52.696
you lost my lunch money huh?

18:53.784 --> 18:55.240
Don't start.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.287
How can you even stand
hanging out at that place?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.550
What do you know about
where I hang out?

19:00.574 --> 19:03.683
Everybody knows about
The Rose, Kyle.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.667
The drinking, the gambling.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.061
I don't drink.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.913
Look, I can't just walk away.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.592
It doesn't work like that.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.465
Are you in trouble?

19:24.554 --> 19:26.114
'Cause I've seen someone
hanging around.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.448
You have?

19:29.472 --> 19:30.536
Yeah.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.301
Who are they, Kyle?

19:38.220 --> 19:40.222
It's your turn to
take out the garbage!

19:41.441 --> 19:42.746
Kyle!

19:59.502 --> 20:01.567
I can't do this.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.111
It's too close to my
daughter's school.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.397
It's bad enough the first
bank was my personal bank.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.421
So, be careful.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.360
What is that?

20:11.384 --> 20:12.535
What does it look like?

20:12.559 --> 20:14.450
I'm not gonna use that.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.060
All right.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.236
It's your game.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.829
This is not a game to me.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.375
Mom, what happened
to Dad's jacket?

20:26.399 --> 20:27.550
Where did you get that?

20:27.574 --> 20:28.333
Did you pull that
from the garbage?

20:28.357 --> 20:29.291
Yeah.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.422
Why?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.423
Well, why was it in there?

20:31.447 --> 20:32.468
What happened?

20:32.492 --> 20:34.992
I wore it the other day,

20:35.016 --> 20:37.864
and it tore when I fell.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.302
Now, throw it away.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.564
I guess...

20:41.588 --> 20:42.739
Are you hungry?

20:42.763 --> 20:44.393
What about your
brother, has he eaten?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.481
He made a sandwich.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.222
Oh.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.832
[sighs] Okay.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.181
Well, let me make you one.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.965
Um, who was that man
you were talking to?

20:51.989 --> 20:53.184
What man?

20:53.208 --> 20:55.341
That man outside.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.407
Um...

20:58.431 --> 21:00.757
He's just, uh, this
friend that I made

21:00.781 --> 21:05.414
at the coffee shop
over by my work.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.242
You know, Mom,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.679
if he's, like, your
boyfriend or something,

21:09.703 --> 21:10.810
that's cool.

21:10.834 --> 21:11.768
I mean, it's been over a year

21:11.792 --> 21:14.292
since dad died.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.426
He's not my boyfriend.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.166
Believe me, he's just
an acquaintance.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.733
Eat this.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.672
I'm going to go check
on your brother.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.318
What happened to Kyle's bike?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.754
No, I just... I saw it

21:41.778 --> 21:43.458
when I came home from
school the other day.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.718
Um, I bumped into it

21:48.742 --> 21:50.981
when I was parking the
van in the car...

21:51.005 --> 21:52.287
I mean, in the garage.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.747
Uh... why?

21:55.009 --> 21:56.837
I was thinking of
taking it to school.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.382
Oh, well, I can drive you.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.905
Hmm, don't worry about it.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.341
I'll get Brook to pick me up.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.584
Okay.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.270
There's just no way

23:03.294 --> 23:04.271
that guy was just a friend

23:04.295 --> 23:05.360
like my mom said.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.578
It was weird.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.971
Did they kiss?

23:07.995 --> 23:09.755
Well, no, but...

23:09.779 --> 23:11.235
she was so nervous afterwards.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.150
Like, she wouldn't even
look me in the eye.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.371
I told her if she had a
boyfriend, I don't care.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.808
I mean, I'd be happy if she did.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.679
Did you get the email?

23:20.703 --> 23:22.420
Early practice is canceled.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.074
Yeah, I got it.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.075
Lunch?

23:25.099 --> 23:26.405
I'm starving.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.645
Aw...

23:29.669 --> 23:31.081
I'm going for lunch with Denise,

23:31.105 --> 23:33.823
so I'll see you later.

23:33.847 --> 23:37.043
Weren't you supposed
to wash my car?

23:37.067 --> 23:38.068
Oh, my God.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.506
Bye.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.573
Oh, my God.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.792
Uh...

23:46.816 --> 23:48.664
What happened to Dylan?

23:48.688 --> 23:50.709
Dylan was so last week.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.126
Oh, my God.

23:53.539 --> 23:54.539
Thai or Vietnamese?

23:54.563 --> 23:55.758
Thai.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.281
No, Vietnamese.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.587
No, Thai.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.502
I don't know, I'm
just so hungry.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.546
Let's just go.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.180
Yeah, let's go.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.982
So I totally thought you
were into Brent Hodgson.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.506
Yeah, I know,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.986
I just... I need to focus on
my scholarship right now.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.466
Parsons makes it hard,

25:35.490 --> 25:37.468
but you have to have
a life, too, Denise,

25:37.492 --> 25:38.948
and boys are a part of life.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.756
A big part.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.040
I don't know.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.704
I'm pretty sure he's
into Jennifer anyway.

25:45.728 --> 25:46.825
Ew.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.087
I hate Jennifer.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.351
I don't know, I don't know why.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.314
[alarm ringing]

25:57.338 --> 25:58.881
What's going on?

25:58.905 --> 26:00.622
What's going on?

26:00.646 --> 26:02.473
Let's get out of here.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.147
That was really weird.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.497
I can't believe
that just happened.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.543
I mean, everyone
was freaking out.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.718
Yeah, did you see anything?

26:53.742 --> 26:55.285
'Cause I just saw
the security guard.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.591
No.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.809
Oh, what?

26:57.833 --> 26:59.400
My mom's car is here.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.600
Are you sure it's hers?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.060
Where is she?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.561
I think we should
go back to school.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.258
Yeah, you're right.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.347
Mom!

27:14.371 --> 27:15.958
Brook, Denise,

27:15.982 --> 27:17.263
what are you doing here?

27:17.287 --> 27:19.178
Well, Brook was just
getting money at the bank,

27:19.202 --> 27:20.136
and the alarms went off.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.572
You were there?

27:21.596 --> 27:22.878
Yeah, we saw everything,

27:22.902 --> 27:24.182
like, the security guard ran out

27:24.206 --> 27:26.098
and everything.

27:26.122 --> 27:29.082
Okay, hop in, let's
get out of here.

27:30.763 --> 27:31.843
That must've been so scary.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.913
Let's get you girls home.

27:41.355 --> 27:42.854
Are you okay?

27:42.878 --> 27:44.639
Yeah.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.815
Did they find out if
there was a robbery?

27:46.839 --> 27:49.798
That's what they're saying.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.106
[cell phone chimes]

28:00.069 --> 28:01.069
What is it?

28:02.289 --> 28:03.962
Oh, nothing, it's just work.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.901
What were you doing by the bank?

28:07.120 --> 28:09.098
Um, I was, uh...

28:09.122 --> 28:10.362
I was at the insurance company.

28:10.386 --> 28:12.188
For your father's claim.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.493
Any luck?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.930
No. No, not yet.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.627
Hey,

28:16.651 --> 28:18.237
what are you doing
home from school?

28:18.261 --> 28:20.141
Brook and I were at the
bank when it was robbed.

28:20.165 --> 28:20.936
Seriously?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.154
Did you see the guy?

28:22.178 --> 28:23.698
No, but he must have
run right past us.

28:23.722 --> 28:25.636
Cool.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.942
Very cool.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.291
Where are you going?

28:28.315 --> 28:31.250
Just, uh, heading out.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.015
I'll, uh... I'll see you later.

28:39.021 --> 28:42.740
I know, that was insane.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.604
I'm just looking through
the reports right now.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.252
I gotta call you back.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.745
[cell phone chimes]

29:39.516 --> 29:41.451
Hey, Mom.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.582
Whatcha doing?

29:42.606 --> 29:44.062
Hey.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.966
What are you doing up? You
have a game tomorrow.

29:45.990 --> 29:47.310
I know. Are you
going to be there?

29:47.334 --> 29:48.197
Yes.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.744
I'm going to be there.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.855
Uh, hey, Mom, where's
Kyle's bike?

29:53.879 --> 29:57.728
Oh, um, I had to take
it to the bike shop.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.841
I couldn't fix it myself, so...

30:01.321 --> 30:02.907
Seriously, you've had a big day.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.082
Go to bed.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.170
Okay.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.345
- Thank you.
- Good night.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.676
I love you. Good night.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.328
Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

30:32.352 --> 30:33.546
Hustle!

30:33.570 --> 30:35.635
Pass it to the wing.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.487
Come on, come on, come on.
Over here!

30:48.455 --> 30:49.455
She's good.

30:52.589 --> 30:53.721
What are you doing here?

30:56.245 --> 30:59.485
I sent you a text message
to reschedule, okay?

30:59.509 --> 31:01.313
I didn't hear anything back.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.599
That's 'cause I call the shots.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.104
[cheering]

31:09.128 --> 31:10.477
[whistle blows]

31:13.045 --> 31:14.960
[clapping] Nice play.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.373
Nice play...

31:17.397 --> 31:19.505
Look, the cops have your bike.

31:19.529 --> 31:20.463
You need to be more careful.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.856
I had to leave it.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.857
I saw my daughter.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.554
She was at the bank.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.990
Well, that's unfortunate,

31:26.014 --> 31:28.819
but it's going to be a lot
worse if you get caught.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.038
You're smart, Anne.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.953
That's why I chose you.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.631
So, be smart.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.527
Do not touch me.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.660
Come on.

31:43.684 --> 31:44.791
Denise!

31:44.815 --> 31:46.948
Get your head in the game!

31:49.168 --> 31:50.754
You want to give
those soccer moms

31:50.778 --> 31:53.824
something to talk about?

31:57.437 --> 31:58.762
Tonight then.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.483
7:00.

32:07.534 --> 32:08.554
Mom?

32:08.578 --> 32:09.991
[gasps] Hi.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.427
Babe, great game!

32:11.451 --> 32:12.863
Thanks.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.167
Uh, what was that
guy doing here?

32:14.191 --> 32:16.736
You ready to go?

32:16.760 --> 32:19.087
Actually, I was going
to hang out with Brook.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.045
Oh, okay. That's fine.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.091
I'll see you later tonight at home.
Okay.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.179
Okay.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.267
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.225
- Great game, Brook.
- Bye, Candice!

32:27.249 --> 32:30.098
- See you later.
- You ready?

32:30.122 --> 32:31.775
- Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

32:39.653 --> 32:42.284
David Brice just
friend requested me.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.328
Who?

32:43.352 --> 32:44.286
That guy I met at the party

32:44.310 --> 32:45.591
last Friday.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.550
At the party you missed, Denise.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.944
We had a game the next day.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.075
So?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.511
You've got have some fun, too.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.861
I mean, even your mom is.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.341
What do you mean?

32:56.365 --> 32:59.020
Did you see that hottie
she was with at the game?

33:02.023 --> 33:03.743
I think I'm going to
accept David's request.

33:03.767 --> 33:05.159
It'll make Liam crazy.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.050
Do you really think that that
guy and my mom are, like...

33:09.074 --> 33:10.597
Don't think about it.

33:12.599 --> 33:15.491
'Cause my mom has been
acting kind of weird lately.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.971
What do you mean?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.711
I don't know, like...

33:18.735 --> 33:21.410
Like, weirdly nervous.

33:21.434 --> 33:22.411
Sounds like she's in love.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.760
What?

33:23.784 --> 33:24.935
We all need love, Denise.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.198
[giggles]

33:27.222 --> 33:30.158
Okay, it's not like that.

33:30.182 --> 33:32.290
I know what will get
your mind off it.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.674
There's a party at
Brent's tonight,

33:33.698 --> 33:35.946
and I'm sure he'd
love it if you came.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.905
I don't know, I'm kind
of tired after the game,

33:38.929 --> 33:41.647
and I-I can't go like this.

33:41.671 --> 33:42.953
Go home,

33:42.977 --> 33:44.041
shower,

33:44.065 --> 33:46.087
and I'll pick you up in an hour.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.436
I don't know.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.567
You're going.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.612
Brook...

33:49.636 --> 33:50.613
You're going.

33:50.637 --> 33:51.831
It'll be fun.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.529
Okay, fine.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.704
But I'm not staying late.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.271
Okay.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.272
Okay?

33:57.296 --> 33:58.471
Okay!

35:26.994 --> 35:29.581
She can come after me
for whatever she wants,

35:29.605 --> 35:31.496
but I will cut her
off at the knees

35:31.520 --> 35:33.324
before I give it to her.

35:33.348 --> 35:34.499
You got that?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.134
Good.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.114
My ex.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.377
She thinks she's
entitled to my money.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.620
You'd think after 12
years she'd know me.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.773
What about your husband?

35:47.797 --> 35:49.234
Did he take care of you guys?

35:50.539 --> 35:53.214
He had a long-term plan.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.954
It didn't work out.

35:54.978 --> 35:55.978
That's too bad.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.692
You should let me
take you away...

35:58.716 --> 35:59.829
Quinlan,

35:59.853 --> 36:02.353
when I'm finished
paying off Kyle's debt,

36:02.377 --> 36:04.486
we won't be seeing
each other ever again.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.227
[scoffs]

36:06.251 --> 36:07.971
Well, I'm just going to
have to take comfort

36:07.995 --> 36:09.186
in the knowledge that

36:09.210 --> 36:12.407
we'll still be spending
some time together.

36:12.431 --> 36:15.608
Seeing as Kyle just racked up a
whole fresh batch of losses.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.239
I gotta give it to the kid,

36:18.263 --> 36:19.240
he's sure trying to
turn his luck around.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.415
Well, that's easy to do

36:20.439 --> 36:22.310
when somebody keeps
loaning him the money.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.985
Are we done?

36:26.009 --> 36:27.185
For now.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.304
Mom?

36:40.328 --> 36:41.479
What is it?

36:41.503 --> 36:42.567
Hi, honey.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.680
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.051
[sighs heavily]

36:48.075 --> 36:51.272
Just feeling a little
sorry for myself.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.211
Did dad's insurance
come through?

36:54.386 --> 36:55.474
Mm-mm.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.802
How was Brook's?

36:59.826 --> 37:01.499
It was fine.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.980
I'm actually thinking of going
to a party with her tonight.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.374
But if you want, I
could stay home.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.679
No. No, you should go

37:07.703 --> 37:08.854
and have fun.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.358
[chuckles] Okay.

37:12.578 --> 37:13.883
Okay?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.409
Mom, is Kyle okay?

37:19.367 --> 37:20.673
[sighs]

37:21.891 --> 37:24.305
He's just a little
lost right now.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.915
So...

37:25.939 --> 37:27.482
you know...

37:27.506 --> 37:29.899
he has to come back to us.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.077
He has to.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.978
You look hot.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.676
Thanks.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.580
Hey, do you mind just
dropping me off somewhere?

37:49.604 --> 37:51.157
What? You're not
coming to the party?

37:51.181 --> 37:52.381
Yeah, no, I'll be there later,

37:52.405 --> 37:54.378
I just need to check on Kyle.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.988
Okay.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.012
Thanks.

38:03.716 --> 38:04.954
Sketchy.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.999
Yeah, jeez.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.392
You're not going in there,

38:08.416 --> 38:09.350
not alone.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.568
Well...

38:10.592 --> 38:12.396
my brother's going
to be in there.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.051
I'll... I'll see you
later at the party.

38:15.075 --> 38:16.574
I'm not leaving you here.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.532
I'll be okay. Go.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.316
Seriously.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.927
I'll meet you there.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.233
You'll be careful?

38:23.257 --> 38:25.844
I promise.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.585
Look, I'll stick around
for a while anyway.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.089
Yeah, okay.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.592
[growing hum of busy crowd]

39:21.228 --> 39:22.945
What are you doing here?

39:22.969 --> 39:24.468
You promised, Kyle.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.189
[player whistles impatiently]

39:27.713 --> 39:29.149
[tapping expectantly]

39:48.168 --> 39:49.798
Raise.

39:49.822 --> 39:50.822
400.

40:32.647 --> 40:35.171
Okay. Yeah. Call.

40:45.660 --> 40:46.724
Boom.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.228
[laughs gleefully]

40:56.149 --> 40:57.324
You owe 5,000.

40:59.369 --> 41:00.521
[Kyle]: Yeah. Yeah, um...

41:00.545 --> 41:02.242
Can I get another five?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.487
Come on, Kyle.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.532
Come on!

41:11.556 --> 41:13.035
We need to get out of here now.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.385
Hey!

41:20.695 --> 41:22.135
Brooke should still be here!
Come on!

41:22.159 --> 41:23.136
Come on, hurry!

41:23.160 --> 41:24.675
Ow!

41:24.699 --> 41:25.918
[Kyle]: Okay.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.138
[Denise]: Get in. Get in.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.744
[Brook]: Good thing
I stuck around.

41:49.768 --> 41:51.397
What the hell happened there?

41:51.421 --> 41:53.269
Nothing. It's just...

41:53.293 --> 41:54.575
Just a misunderstanding.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.577
I'll say.

41:56.601 --> 41:57.665
Hey, Kyle,

41:57.689 --> 41:59.081
do you want to go to a party?

42:00.451 --> 42:01.451
Um...

42:01.475 --> 42:02.496
Seriously?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.280
What?

42:04.304 --> 42:05.411
I don't think either of us

42:05.435 --> 42:08.502
are really in a party
mood right now.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.417
Could you just drop
us back at home?

42:11.441 --> 42:12.462
Are you sure?

42:12.486 --> 42:14.420
Yeah, I'm sure.

42:14.444 --> 42:15.444
Okay.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.156
[Denise]: See you at school.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.617
Ow.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.512
Oh...

42:48.566 --> 42:50.979
Ow.

42:51.003 --> 42:53.329
You okay?

42:53.353 --> 42:54.678
Yeah, I just...

42:54.702 --> 42:56.008
I just rolled it.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.160
[Brook honks horn
as she drives away]

42:58.184 --> 42:59.161
Are you going to tell Mom?

42:59.185 --> 43:01.187
Are you kidding?
She'd freak out.

43:03.406 --> 43:04.775
You know, I'm not just gambling

43:04.799 --> 43:05.844
because I think it's cool.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.062
I just thought...

43:09.369 --> 43:12.653
after dad died...

43:12.677 --> 43:14.350
I could help out,

43:14.374 --> 43:15.593
you know?

43:17.116 --> 43:19.640
With the debt?

43:21.250 --> 43:22.401
And I was winning there,

43:22.425 --> 43:25.820
for a while.

43:27.082 --> 43:29.147
And then...

43:29.171 --> 43:31.323
Well, then I wasn't.

43:31.347 --> 43:32.673
So I was just...

43:32.697 --> 43:34.588
I was trying to win it back,

43:34.612 --> 43:38.766
and things kind of
got out of control.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.986
Meaning you owe?

43:42.010 --> 43:44.162
I can win it back, Denise.

43:44.186 --> 43:45.729
How? By taking my lunch money?

43:45.753 --> 43:49.341
No, I... I borrow,

43:49.365 --> 43:50.821
from the house.

43:50.845 --> 43:52.238
Yeah, I saw that.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.304
I can win it back.

43:55.328 --> 43:59.438
Kyle, stop, all right?

43:59.462 --> 44:03.181
Things have gotten
way out of hand.

44:03.205 --> 44:04.487
You know that guy in the suit?

44:04.511 --> 44:06.271
Quinlan, yeah.

44:06.295 --> 44:07.925
Mom's been meeting with him.

44:07.949 --> 44:10.275
What?

44:10.299 --> 44:11.712
Why would she be doing that?

44:11.736 --> 44:13.409
I don't know.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.193
Maybe to pay off your debt?

44:15.217 --> 44:16.978
How? She doesn't have any money.

44:17.002 --> 44:18.786
Yeah, that's what worries me.

44:23.051 --> 44:24.096
Okay.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.423
Okay, I won't do it, then.

44:27.447 --> 44:29.773
I won't gamble anymore.

44:29.797 --> 44:33.124

You've found him.

01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.265
Oh.

01:12:17.289 --> 01:12:19.528
Do you think I could speak
with you privately?

01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:21.400
Sure thing.

01:12:21.424 --> 01:12:22.816
Great.

Um...

Well, it's come to my attention

01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:53.369
that my son, Kyle,
owes you some money.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.912
Yeah, Kyle.

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.174
Unfortunately,

01:12:57.198 --> 01:13:00.482
he's had a bad run
of things lately.

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:03.529
I never feel good
about that, but...

01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:04.530
he seems like a good kid.

01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:05.618
He is.

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:07.489
He's a really good kid,

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:09.796
you know, and, um...

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.668
he lost his dad last year,

01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:15.018
so he's been struggling, and...

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:16.411
We all have.

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:17.760

Well, how can I help you?

01:13:20.657 --> 01:13:23.418
Well, I was wondering
if we could, um...

01:13:23.442 --> 01:13:24.985
come up with a solution,

01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:29.076
or something, you know,
like a payment plan, or...

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.469
I don't know,

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:32.384

to even ask, I know.

a solution to your problem.

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:41.025
But first, have dinner with me.

01:13:42.374 --> 01:13:43.694
I thought I could
convince Quinlan

01:13:43.718 --> 01:13:46.136
that he was a boy that
just lost his father.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.686

was getting into.

I'm going to need
you to rob a bank.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.669

to rob banks for him.

that they're going to be
ready to move in very soon.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:41.991
What does that mean?

01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:43.602
Well, that means

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.826
that we get to go back to being
a normal family again...

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.850

get you off to school.

01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:31.346
Wow! Awesome!

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:32.347
[cheering]

01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:33.566
That was so great!

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:35.133
That was awesome! Good game!

01:24:35.157 --> 01:24:36.177
Thanks!

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.266
Hey, hey!

01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:40.094
Great performance
out there, Harding.

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:41.443
Man, way to bring it.

01:24:41.467 --> 01:24:43.347
That's enough to get you
a scholarship, I think.

01:24:43.371 --> 01:24:45.752
Yeah, it's a little
late for that, though.

01:24:45.776 --> 01:24:47.014
Nah, I don't think so.

01:24:47.038 --> 01:24:48.363
I took it upon myself
to call the recruiter.

01:24:48.387 --> 01:24:50.267
I, uh, I told them it would
be worth their while

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:51.336
to come back and see you.

01:24:51.782 --> 01:24:53.455
Are you serious?

01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:54.674
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

01:24:54.698 --> 01:24:56.763
No, no, hey, you did
all the hard work.

01:24:56.787 --> 01:24:58.112
But there's no reason

01:24:58.136 --> 01:24:59.776
why you can't continue
to bring it, right?

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.072
Don't worry, I'll bring it.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.116
All right.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.140
Good job.

01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:05.554
I'm so proud of you...

01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:06.816
I'm so proud of you,
let's go celebrate.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.520
Uh, we're getting ahead
of ourselves, okay?

01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:10.211
She still has last
series to play through.

01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:11.995
I'm thinking you'll
win it in five.

01:25:12.019 --> 01:25:13.519
I'm going to say four.

01:25:13.543 --> 01:25:14.476
Wanna bet?

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.130
Uh, too soon.

01:25:16.154 --> 01:25:17.131
Too soon...

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:18.176
Kyle!

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.133
Easy with the betting.

01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:20.482
Okay?

01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:21.483
Are you cold?

01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:22.876
No, I'm good.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.704
I'm wearing, like,
three sweaters.

01:25:24.728 --> 01:25:26.662
