<i>really sad,</i>

18:29.274 --> 18:31.068
<i>and ugly and alone,</i>

18:31.610 --> 18:33.862

<i>I think she just, you know,
wants to be seen.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:54.007
<i>Seen?</i>

18:54.508 --> 18:55.509

19:03.100 --> 19:04.101
<i>How do you think
it should go down?</i>

19:04.685 --> 19:07.146
<i>I figured we'd be out
together at a bar.</i>

19:07.688 --> 19:09.940
<i>- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Um, have a few drinks.</i>

19:10.440 --> 19:11.233
<i>And maybe you're at the bar,</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:13.152
<i>- and you come over.
- Wow. And when I get there,</i>

25:52.717 --> 25:55.887
<i>No, ma'am. I'm, uh...</i>

25:56.888 --> 25:59.224
<i>Do you have a job?</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:01.434
<i>I don't.</i>

26:02.060 --> 26:06.106
<i>Can't pay rent with no job.
Get a job.</i>

26:15.115 --> 26:17.242
<i>Guess we got to get a job, baby.</i>

26:34.593 --> 26:36.428
<i>Hold on, man. Where the fuck
you think you're going?</i>

26:37.053 --> 26:38.680
<i>Just want to talk with
my friend Bo, man.</i>

26:39.139 --> 26:40.557
<i>Bo? Nigga, you don't know no Bo.</i>

26:41.099 --> 26:41.933
<i>Get the fuck up
out of here, man,</i>

26:42.809 --> 26:45.020
<i>- before I beat your ass one t--
-  Hey, yo, T.</i>

26:45.312 --> 26:46.146
<i>Ease up, man.</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:48.523
<i>That's my boy.</i>

26:49.149 --> 26:51.943
<i>- Walked the yard with that fool.
- Appreciate it.</i>

26:52.902 --> 26:54.404
<i>Man. Sight for sore eyes.</i>

26:54.946 --> 26:57.407
<i>Man, I heard you got out, man.
No P.O.?</i>

26:57.949 --> 26:59.534
<i>- No, sir.
- No halfway house.</i>

27:00.285 --> 27:01.995
<i>- You just a free man, huh?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

27:02.495 --> 27:04.414
<i>Man, it's good to see you, man.</i>

27:04.998 --> 27:08.460
<i>- Yeah. Welcome home.</i>

27:09.794 --> 27:12.297
<i>You weren't lying, man.
It's beautiful out here.</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:13.715
<i>Yeah. It's a peace of mind.</i>

27:14.299 --> 27:15.425
<i>So what do you got
going on, huh?</i>

27:15.967 --> 27:16.718
<i>Just out here
working on your suntan?</i>

27:17.302 --> 27:18.470
<i>Ah, man. I'm making it
do what it do,</i>

27:18.928 --> 27:21.056
<i>- you know?</i>

27:21.348 --> 27:22.515
<i>That's your dog?</i>

27:22.849 --> 27:24.225
<i>Uh, nah, just...</i>

27:24.684 --> 27:27.145
<i>I-I guess I-I kind of found her.</i>

27:28.313 --> 27:30.857
<i>- Shit, look like she found you.</i>

27:33.026 --> 27:35.403
<i>So, what's up, man?
You need something?</i>

27:36.029 --> 27:37.572
<i>- Money? Place to stay?
- Nah, man. Nah. Nah.</i>

27:38.198 --> 27:39.074
<i>- Talk to me.
- No, I'm not, I'm not looking</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:40.575
<i>for any handouts, man.
I'm just--</i>

27:41.326 --> 27:44.329
<i>Hey, look, man, come on.
Miss me with the bullshit.</i>

27:44.704 --> 27:45.455
<i>We family.</i>

27:46.039 --> 27:48.500
<i>If you need anything,
you let me know.</i>

27:48.833 --> 27:50.168
<i>Okay.</i>

27:54.172 --> 27:55.840
<i>Man, could you help me
get a job?</i>

27:56.383 --> 27:57.717
<i>You know, just something
like, uh...</i>

27:58.301 --> 27:59.427
<i>I don't know,
something straight. Uh...</i>

28:00.053 --> 28:01.721
<i>A place to clock
in and out of, if I wanted.</i>

28:02.347 --> 28:04.474
<i>You know, just something...
something to do.</i>

28:05.058 --> 28:07.435
<i>You know what?
I got this boy Luther,</i>

28:08.019 --> 28:09.437
<i>right on the corner
of Market and Venice.</i>

28:09.896 --> 28:10.855
<i>- Okay.
- Little boujee spot.</i>

28:11.690 --> 28:13.608
<i>Don't pay much,
but he owes me a favor.</i>

28:14.025 --> 28:15.151
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

28:15.735 --> 28:18.029
<i>He cuts up out of there
around 5:00,</i>

28:18.488 --> 28:19.197
<i>so if you head up there...</i>

28:19.823 --> 28:21.991
<i>- Market and Venice?
- Market and Venice.</i>

28:22.367 --> 28:23.451
<i>I appreciate you, man.</i>

28:23.868 --> 28:25.161
<i>Anytime, bro.</i>

28:25.537 --> 28:27.747
<i>Thank you, brother.</i>

28:28.373 --> 28:29.874
<i>Got to get you out on that
basketball court, man.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:31.710
<i>- You ready for that?
-  Come on,</i>

28:32.168 --> 28:33.378
<i>I was born ready, man.</i>

28:33.920 --> 28:35.380
<i>Better just hope
you're on my team, Bo.</i>

28:35.880 --> 28:36.840
<i>You know I'm a solo act.</i>

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
I'll see you around, man.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.891
<i> All right, sweetheart.</i>

28:47.434 --> 28:49.936
<i>The warrant will be served
at the offices of</i>

28:50.228 --> 28:51.229
<i>Hoke and Miller.</i>

28:51.771 --> 28:53.648
<i>We have reason to believe
multiple partners</i>

28:54.190 --> 28:55.108
<i>at the firm have
falsified invoices,</i>

28:56.025 --> 28:59.404
<i>or otherwise embezzled money
from their clients in a scheme</i>

28:59.946 --> 29:01.823
<i>- lasting two years or more.</i>

29:02.449 --> 29:04.659
<i> Given this
new information regarding</i>

29:05.410 --> 29:07.245
<i>the falsified documents,
I think that traditionally...</i>

29:13.752 --> 29:16.004
<i>Hey, what's the judge's
Wi-Fi password?</i>

29:16.379 --> 29:16.880
<i>Can't give that out.</i>

29:17.422 --> 29:18.757
You see, Judge Wettick,

29:19.549 --> 29:22.302
<i>they've clearly been involved
in corporate malfeasance...</i>

29:22.927 --> 29:24.471
"They've clearly been involved

29:24.929 --> 29:27.140
<i>in corporate malfeasance."</i>

29:29.809 --> 29:32.020
<i>You know, you can give it to me.
She gave it to me before.</i>

29:32.896 --> 29:33.938
<i>She lets me have it
all the time, you know.</i>

29:34.481 --> 29:35.523
<i>I just don't remember
what it was.</i>

29:36.065 --> 29:37.442
<i>It was named after her, uh...</i>

29:37.817 --> 29:38.526
<i>Her dog.</i>

29:39.110 --> 29:40.195
Her dog, that's right.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.530
<i>Thank you, Danny.</i>

29:42.947 --> 29:44.657
<i>How do you spell that?</i>

29:45.116 --> 29:47.285
F... I...

29:47.577 --> 29:49.287
<i>D... O.</i>

29:49.829 --> 29:51.581
<i>- Are you messing with me?
-  No.</i>

29:52.123 --> 29:53.500
<i>You're messing with me.
The name's Fido?</i>

29:54.000 --> 29:55.251
Like Fi-- Yeah.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.635
<i>It's not Fido, Danny.</i>

30:04.093 --> 30:06.596
<i>It's not Fido. Hey, Judge.</i>

30:07.180 --> 30:09.015
<i>We're done for the day,
Detective Sunday.</i>

30:09.849 --> 30:11.476
<i>That is a very nice outfit.
Is that new?</i>

30:11.976 --> 30:12.727
<i>Mm-hmm. What do you want?</i>

30:13.144 --> 30:14.521
<i>Search warrant.</i>

30:15.021 --> 30:15.814
<i>You need to go see
another judge.</i>

30:16.356 --> 30:18.566
<i>Listen, it's not
corporate malfeasance.</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:19.692
<i>It's a murder case.</i>

30:20.109 --> 30:21.736
<i>Young girl.</i>

30:22.362 --> 30:25.156
<i>It'll take you, like,
two minutes. Come on.</i>

30:48.680 --> 30:51.182
I'm so hungry.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.519
<i>Last night was amazing.</i>

30:58.398 --> 31:01.442
<i>I just have that
nervous feeling.</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:02.819
<i>Ah... [scoffs]</i>

31:03.361 --> 31:05.572
<i>'Cause I don't know
how you feel.</i>

31:07.407 --> 31:08.658
<i>And...</i>

31:09.075 --> 31:11.327
<i>I don't want to...</i>

31:11.870 --> 31:13.746
<i>I don't know,
I don't want to pry.</i>

31:14.247 --> 31:14.873
<i>And I want you to... [chuckles]</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:18.710
<i>Guess I want you to think
I'm, like...</i>

31:19.210 --> 31:20.003
<i>I don't know, like, a cool girl</i>

31:20.879 --> 31:22.547
<i>who doesn't really care
as much as I actually do.</i>

31:29.721 --> 31:30.680
<i>I'm scared as shit.</i>

31:42.942 --> 31:44.652
<i>Yo, can I help you?</i>

31:45.111 --> 31:46.404
<i>Yeah, I'm looking for Luther.</i>

31:46.696 --> 31:47.447
<i>Who are you?</i>

31:47.947 --> 31:48.907
<i>I'm J, I'm a friend of Bo.</i>

31:49.699 --> 31:51.701
<i>Told me to ask for Luther.
I'm looking for some work.</i>

31:52.243 --> 31:53.828
<i>- You know Bo?
-  I do.</i>

31:54.287 --> 31:55.079
<i>- Bet.
- Yeah.</i>

31:55.622 --> 31:58.625
<i>What's good, man?
Come on in. I got you.</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:03.296
<i>Right in there.</i>

32:05.048 --> 32:08.593
7:01. 7:04.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.930
<i>7:08.</i>

32:22.273 --> 32:25.234
<i>You must be pretty shocked.</i>

32:25.652 --> 32:28.947
<i> I know I am.</i>

32:35.161 --> 32:37.330
<i>Have you heard from Elizabeth?</i>

32:39.457 --> 32:40.750
<i>Do you know where they are?</i>

32:41.292 --> 32:42.919
<i>Our lawyer said
I shouldn't talk to you.</i>

32:43.419 --> 32:47.173
- Come on, man.

32:49.175 --> 32:52.303
<i>Your wife kidnapped my son.</i>

32:57.684 --> 32:59.769
<i>Please.</i>

33:00.353 --> 33:03.356
<i>Please, if you know
anything, just...</i>

33:05.525 --> 33:07.276
<i>Just tell me,
and I'll do whatever I can</i>

33:07.652 --> 33:09.362
<i>to protect them both.</i>

33:18.705 --> 33:21.207
So, her husband asks her,

33:21.541 --> 33:23.334
<i>he says, "Ellida,</i>

33:23.835 --> 33:26.295
<i>do you love this stranger?"</i>

33:26.671 --> 33:28.756
<i>And she says, "Love him?</i>

33:29.173 --> 33:30.883
<i>How can I say?</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:34.804
<i>I only know that, to me,
he's a terrible thing,</i>

33:35.138 --> 33:36.097
<i>but that</i>

33:36.639 --> 33:38.016
<i>it's with him I feel I belong."</i>

33:38.516 --> 33:40.768
<i>So, her husband says,</i>

33:41.352 --> 33:43.980
<i>"Then I will consent
to let you go."</i>

33:44.397 --> 33:46.441
<i>Hey, does that tickle?</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:48.401
<i>That feels nice.</i>

33:51.654 --> 33:53.406
<i>Your husband
ever paint your nails?</i>

33:53.531 --> 33:55.241
<i>No.</i>

33:56.034 --> 33:56.993
<i>Hey, you know how
I always thought of you,</i>

33:57.535 --> 34:00.538
<i>Mrs. Shannonhouse?
Being so imposing.</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:02.999
<i>Hmm. [sighs]</i>

34:03.416 --> 34:06.002
<i>Standing up there,</i>

34:06.502 --> 34:08.755
<i>so big and powerful.</i>

34:11.049 --> 34:12.550
<i>And now?</i>

34:12.925 --> 34:15.344
<i>What do you think now?</i>

34:16.596 --> 34:18.973
<i>I think you have
really pretty knees.</i>

34:22.185 --> 34:24.437
<i>Pretty thighs.</i>

34:24.937 --> 34:27.023
<i>- Okay, so her husband...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

34:27.523 --> 34:29.942
<i>- Wangle...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

34:30.359 --> 34:31.486
<i>He let her go?</i>

34:31.611 --> 34:33.529
<i>Right?</i>

34:33.738 --> 34:35.448
<i>Why?</i>

34:37.033 --> 34:39.160
<i>He let her choose
what she wanted.</i>

34:39.744 --> 34:41.079
<i>Okay, so now that
she can choose,</i>

34:41.621 --> 34:44.582
<i>that means that
she can also choose to</i>

34:45.124 --> 34:47.585
<i>- not go with her lover, right?
- Right.</i>

34:49.087 --> 34:50.797
<i>So, what did she do?</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:52.965
<i>She stayed with her husband.</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:55.176
<i>slow, dramatic music </i>

34:57.303 --> 34:58.596
<i>And you?</i>

35:00.473 --> 35:01.474
<i>If your husband said that</i>

35:02.391 --> 35:04.685
<i>you could go with me,
would you have stayed with him?</i>

35:08.106 --> 35:09.065
<i>I'm here, aren't I?</i>

35:09.482 --> 35:12.110
<i>I'm here with you.</i>

35:15.321 --> 35:16.864
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

35:17.406 --> 35:19.826
- Yeah, you are. Yeah.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.037
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

35:23.496 --> 35:24.664
<i>Are you ever scared?</i>

35:24.956 --> 35:26.499
<i>Yeah. Terrified.</i>

35:26.624 --> 35:28.793
<i>Hey.</i>

35:29.293 --> 35:32.130
<i>Don't worry, Mrs. Shannonhouse.</i>

35:32.630 --> 35:34.924
<i>Hey. Venga, venga, venga.</i>

35:45.935 --> 35:47.103
<i>Is that your dog?</i>

35:47.603 --> 35:48.813
<i>The fuck? Course she's mine.</i>

35:49.272 --> 35:50.356
<i>Uh, no, uh... She-she was,</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:51.983
<i>- she was following me.
- Following you?</i>

35:52.525 --> 35:53.276
<i>Yeah, I saw her
down at the beach.</i>

35:53.860 --> 35:54.986
<i>She followed me
all the way up here.</i>

35:55.611 --> 35:56.112
<i>- Did you fucking feed my dog?
- I-I'm sorry?</i>

35:56.529 --> 35:57.822
<i>Don't fucking feed my dog,</i>

35:58.322 --> 36:01.159
<i>and stay the fuck away from us.</i>

36:20.219 --> 36:20.970
<i>Hi.</i>

36:21.387 --> 36:23.472
<i>It's you again. Hmm.</i>

36:23.848 --> 36:25.016
<i>You told me that, uh,</i>

36:25.808 --> 36:28.436
<i>I-I could come back if I was
able to secure a-a job,</i>

36:29.312 --> 36:31.856
<i>and-and I just wanted you
to know that I did.</i>

36:34.400 --> 36:36.569
<i>- Is this real?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:37.028 --> 36:38.154
<i>- That was quick.</i>

36:38.571 --> 36:40.114
<i>Yeah. Lucky, I guess.</i>

36:40.531 --> 36:41.699
<i>No such thing as luck.</i>

36:42.200 --> 36:43.826
<i> Fair enough.</i>

36:44.243 --> 36:46.078
<i>You want to see the place?</i>

36:46.537 --> 36:48.706
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:49.916
<i>Entrez.</i>

36:50.333 --> 36:51.626
<i>- Okay?
- Yeah.</i>

36:52.001 --> 36:53.127
<i>Okay. My shoes?</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:54.962
<i>You might want to leave them on.</i>

36:55.379 --> 36:58.216
<i> Okay.</i>

37:00.593 --> 37:02.720
<i>Where were you
staying at before?</i>

37:03.054 --> 37:05.848
<i>I was, um...</i>

37:06.265 --> 37:08.142
<i>I was, I was upstate.</i>

37:08.559 --> 37:10.019
<i>Upstate where?</i>

37:10.436 --> 37:13.481
<i>At the-the desert.</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:15.942
<i>You got references?</i>

37:16.442 --> 37:18.945
<i>Uh, no, ma'am. I-I was a...</i>

37:19.570 --> 37:22.406
<i>I was an inmate.
High Desert State Prison.</i>

37:22.949 --> 37:25.201
<i>Hmm. That's a different kind
of desert.</i>

37:25.618 --> 37:27.745
<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

37:28.287 --> 37:30.081
So, is this through your P.O.?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.458
<i>No, ma'am.
I-I-I don't have a P.O.</i>

37:33.251 --> 37:36.003
<i>I was, I was exonerated
of my charges.</i>

37:36.587 --> 37:38.089
<i>Well, how long
were you up there?</i>

37:38.464 --> 37:39.090
<i>15 years.</i>

37:39.465 --> 37:41.467
<i>15 years?</i>

37:45.429 --> 37:46.097
<i>I guess you ain't got no pets.</i>

37:46.597 --> 37:47.765
<i>- No, ma'am.
- Allergies?</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:49.267
<i>'Cause there might
be a cat around here.</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:51.936
<i> I think I'm okay.</i>

37:52.436 --> 37:53.896
<i>You got any bad habits? Drugs?</i>

37:54.272 --> 37:55.022
<i>No.</i>

37:55.606 --> 37:56.857
Weed is fine, so don't lie.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.652
<i> Yeah, well...</i>

38:01.612 --> 38:03.114
<i>Look, I live
right upstairs, so...</i>

38:03.656 --> 38:05.825
<i>noise, I don't do.
I hear everything.</i>

38:06.284 --> 38:07.159
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

38:07.952 --> 38:10.288
<i>The lady that was here before,
she was nice and quiet.</i>

38:10.788 --> 38:12.039
<i>She was a friend of mine.</i>

38:12.623 --> 38:14.333
<i>She passed away
in that bathroom.</i>

38:14.917 --> 38:16.419
<i>Her grandkids ain't
cleaned up shit, so...</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:18.296
<i>I know you're gonna
need some stuff.</i>

38:19.005 --> 38:20.715
<i>If you want anything from here,
you could take it.</i>

38:21.257 --> 38:22.425
<i>- You can have it.
- Ma'am, I'm...</i>

38:23.009 --> 38:24.760
<i>I'm-I'm more than happy to,
you know,</i>

38:25.303 --> 38:26.220
<i>help get rid of
some of this stuff.</i>

38:26.679 --> 38:29.098
<i>Yeah, I'd be happy about that.</i>

38:29.807 --> 38:32.518
<i>I'll take a little
off your rent, first month only.</i>

38:32.810 --> 38:34.603
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

38:35.813 --> 38:37.148
<i>Be right back.</i>

38:37.773 --> 38:40.026
<i>- Sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- Thank you.</i>

38:40.860 --> 38:43.237
<i>And don't-don't call me "ma'am"
no more. I don't like that.</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:46.782
<i>You... you got it.</i>

38:50.536 --> 38:52.788
<i>We were founded in 1952</i>

38:53.372 --> 38:55.583
<i>by a man of God
named Glenn Hewitt.</i>

38:56.375 --> 38:59.795
<i>As you can tell, by day,
we're a traditional school,</i>

39:00.338 --> 39:01.505
<i>but, uh, Glenn Hewitt
is so much more.</i>

39:02.381 --> 39:05.343
<i>Students not only enjoy clubs,
sports and activities,</i>

39:05.801 --> 39:07.887
<i>but also jobs, church,</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:11.140
<i>uh, therapy and social-emotional
development.</i>

39:11.724 --> 39:12.892
<i>You all really lucked out
with these two.</i>

39:13.517 --> 39:16.228
<i>Keisha and Miguel are two
of our top students.</i>

39:16.854 --> 39:19.190
<i>Keisha, would you
be comfortable sharing</i>

39:19.732 --> 39:21.317
<i>with us what first
brought you here?</i>

39:21.817 --> 39:23.778
<i>Yeah. When my mom died,</i>

39:24.070 --> 39:25.488
<i>I lashed out.</i>

39:26.197 --> 39:28.657
<i>Started running with
the wrong crowd, so my grandma</i>

39:29.033 --> 39:30.659
<i>sent me here. And, uh,</i>

39:31.577 --> 39:33.454
<i>it was a little rough at first,
but I really came to love it.</i>

39:33.913 --> 39:36.374
<i>tense, dramatic music </i>

40:51.282 --> 40:52.199
<i>Hey.</i>

40:52.741 --> 40:54.118
<i>If that dumpster
gets full, you can't</i>

40:54.952 --> 40:58.080
<i>put that stuff on the street.
I'm not paying for a fine.</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:00.833
<i>No problem.</i>

41:02.835 --> 41:04.837
<i>And I saw your little article.</i>

41:07.131 --> 41:09.216
<i>You forgot to tell me
that you was out here selling</i>

41:09.633 --> 41:11.010
<i>your business, huh?</i>

41:12.845 --> 41:15.806
<i>Ah, it was a...
it was a long time ago.</i>

41:16.015 --> 41:17.683
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

41:18.642 --> 41:20.478
<i>Look.</i>

41:21.145 --> 41:24.231
<i>You can't be doing that business
here in my building.</i>

41:24.523 --> 41:26.150
<i>Okay?</i>

41:26.650 --> 41:28.986
<i>I don't do that anymore.</i>

41:30.946 --> 41:32.823
<i>All right.</i>

41:34.200 --> 41:35.117
<i>Hey, uh,</i>

41:35.534 --> 41:36.494
<i>I found some of her, uh...</i>

41:37.119 --> 41:39.288
<i> you know,
personal belongings</i>

41:39.705 --> 41:40.664
<i>- and some photos.
- No, no.</i>

41:41.499 --> 41:42.541
<i>- You know, you're in them.
- I told you, I don't want</i>

41:43.042 --> 41:44.376
<i>anything from in here. Toss it.</i>

41:45.002 --> 41:45.753
<i>Well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't I just,</i>

41:46.629 --> 41:49.089
<i>you know, leave them out
in the hallway, in case...</i>

41:49.673 --> 41:52.009
<i>- you change your mind.</i>

42:04.522 --> 42:05.397
Hey!

42:05.898 --> 42:08.108
<i>suspenseful music </i>

43:19.888 --> 43:22.057
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

43:22.433 --> 43:23.309
<i>The treadmills, TVs,</i>

43:23.809 --> 43:24.602
<i>- not working.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

43:25.102 --> 43:27.146
<i>The last one went out today.</i>

43:28.647 --> 43:30.024
<i>Really?</i>

43:30.608 --> 43:32.359
<i>So why am I paying
75 bucks a month</i>

43:32.943 --> 43:33.777
<i>to not watch
Will & Grace right now?</i>

43:34.653 --> 43:37.489
<i>Probably because you're
too cheap to pay 350 bucks</i>

43:38.115 --> 43:40.492
<i>at Equinox to watch
whatever the hell you want.</i>

43:40.951 --> 43:41.744
<i>Is that so?</i>

43:42.286 --> 43:44.330
<i>Or you could just use
your iPhone.</i>

43:45.831 --> 43:46.915
<i>Do you even have Internet here?</i>

43:47.791 --> 43:49.251
<i>Or you steal it from
the burger place next door?</i>

43:49.668 --> 43:50.544
We got it.

43:51.128 --> 43:54.298
<i>The password is
"Dress For The Body You Have,"</i>

43:54.798 --> 43:57.009
<i>but the "A" is an ampersand.</i>

44:23.160 --> 44:24.453
<i>Hey.</i>

44:24.870 --> 44:26.330
<i>- Hi.
- You look nice.</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:27.915
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:28.332 --> 44:29.458
<i>Yo, can I hit that?</i>

44:30.000 --> 44:32.252
<i>Yeah, sure.
What, you got a date?</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:34.046
<i>Nah.</i>

44:35.297 --> 44:38.092
<i>I got to go to this
gallery thing.</i>

44:38.384 --> 44:39.718
<i>Show my face.</i>

44:40.302 --> 44:41.679
<i>Well, you know,
I got some food cooking.</i>

44:42.221 --> 44:44.473
<i>Would you...
would you eat with me?</i>

44:45.015 --> 44:46.892
- Come on. Come on, just...

44:47.726 --> 44:48.769
<i>You don't want to go
on an empty stomach.</i>

44:49.311 --> 44:50.729
- Let me cook for you.

44:51.230 --> 44:51.980
<i>No, I don't want to go at all.</i>

44:52.856 --> 44:55.275
<i> Well, go ahead
and sit down. Put your...</i>

44:55.818 --> 44:56.485
<i>put your feet up.
That's it.</i>

44:57.069 --> 44:57.861
<i>I'm gonna show you
what I can do.</i>

44:58.404 --> 45:00.614
<i>I was a legend of Tier 3,
Cell Block C.</i>

45:01.156 --> 45:04.368
<i>That sounds like a country song.</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:06.370
<i>So, only women?</i>

45:06.745 --> 45:08.247
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

45:10.708 --> 45:11.917
<i>Yeah. Only women.</i>

45:12.710 --> 45:14.878
<i>I figured you'd make
more money with men.</i>

45:15.212 --> 45:16.130
<i>That's fair.</i>

45:16.714 --> 45:18.090
<i>What, you got some
sort of hang-up?</i>

45:18.215 --> 45:19.508
<i>Nah.</i>

45:19.925 --> 45:21.260
<i>Not at all. It's just...</i>

45:21.760 --> 45:22.720
<i>You know, it's not my bag.</i>

45:23.220 --> 45:25.431
<i>Well, sex is sex, right?</i>

45:26.724 --> 45:29.184
<i>Not really about the sex.</i>

45:31.228 --> 45:33.439
<i>It's not? So what you selling?
Cooking lessons?</i>

45:35.566 --> 45:38.318
<i>You know, it's more about
what happens before, you know?</i>

45:38.736 --> 45:39.486
<i>Happens after.</i>

45:40.070 --> 45:41.780
<i>Hell, the women
that I work with,</i>

45:42.281 --> 45:43.741
<i>I don't know, some of them...</i>

45:44.241 --> 45:45.200
<i>They're just lonely, you know?</i>

45:45.743 --> 45:48.078
<i>You know, they're sad.
Some are...</i>

45:48.954 --> 45:51.623
<i>you know, a little angry,
a little frustrated. Some...</i>

45:52.040 --> 45:52.708
<i>some are bored.</i>

45:53.208 --> 45:55.419
<i>Some are just busy.</i>

45:55.919 --> 45:57.463
<i>It's my job to really see them,</i>

45:57.921 --> 45:59.631
<i>and-and-and if I can, I...</i>

46:00.257 --> 46:02.050
<i>try to get them
to open up a little bit.</i>

46:02.426 --> 46:04.970
<i>What you mean "open up"?</i>

46:06.805 --> 46:08.766
<i>You know, it's like this window.</i>

46:09.391 --> 46:10.601
<i>I walked in that apartment,
it was clear</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:12.603
<i>nobody had touched that window
in years, you know.</i>

46:13.145 --> 46:14.813
<i>It was stuck.
It just... [chuckles]</i>

46:15.439 --> 46:17.316
<i>And I knew if I forced it,
it was never gonna open.</i>

46:17.775 --> 46:18.525
<i>It'd probably break.</i>

46:18.942 --> 46:21.320
<i>So, I went slow.</i>

46:21.779 --> 46:24.114
<i>I was... I was soft.</i>

46:24.948 --> 46:26.617
<i>I got it to open a little bit,
but I'll tell you what,</i>

46:27.075 --> 46:28.076
<i>that whole room changed.</i>

46:28.494 --> 46:30.120
<i>optimistic music </i>

46:30.579 --> 46:32.456
<i>All of a sudden, I could...</i>

46:32.956 --> 46:35.167
<i>I could hear the ocean.</i>

46:37.795 --> 46:40.339
<i>Have you ever had
a real relationship?</i>

46:56.146 --> 46:57.564
<i>slow, suspenseful music </i>

47:02.611 --> 47:03.362
Lisa.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.489
<i>Hi, Julian.</i>

47:10.202 --> 47:12.287
<i>It's fine. Come on.</i>

47:30.180 --> 47:33.225
<i>LAPD. Open up.
We have a search warrant.</i>

47:36.144 --> 47:37.312
<i>It's open.</i>

48:11.221 --> 48:13.432
<i>Stay the fuck out.</i>

48:17.185 --> 48:18.812
<i>tense, suspenseful music </i>
