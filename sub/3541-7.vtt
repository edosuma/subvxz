STEFAN: For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.590
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.759
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.053
He told me about your ex. Katherine?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.222
I don't want you
seeing Elena anymore.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.059
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.603
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.439
The Lockwoods are werewolves.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.108
KATHERINE: The werewolf gene
runs in the Lockwood family.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.527
- What triggers the curse?
- You kill somebody!

00:28.695 --> 00:31.488
The werewolf part of the curse
is sealed with a moonstone.

00:31.656 --> 00:34.700
Katherine will only rip your heart out.
Let me do it for her.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.285
[GRUNTS]

00:36.494 --> 00:38.162
You have no idea what you've done.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.498
- Did I put a kink in your master plan?
- Do you honestly believe...

00:41.666 --> 00:44.460
...that I don't have a Plan B?
- Jenna, no!

00:44.627 --> 00:47.963
We were stupid, sneaking around,
thinking we weren't gonna get caught.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.883
- But it's over.
- I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.469
- And you're not going to stop...
- Until he kills me.

00:54.512 --> 00:55.554
Here.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.850
I'm still shaking.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.728
What happened?

01:03.605 --> 01:04.646
[SIGHS]

01:05.147 --> 01:08.150
Go ahead, tell him.
You're gonna love this.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.319
- I saw Katherine today.
- Where?

01:10.487 --> 01:13.155
At the Grill.
I just stopped by to just gawk...

01:13.323 --> 01:16.450
...and quasi-stalk Matt.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.294
- Do you need a table?
- No. I...

01:27.462 --> 01:31.924
I'm not staying.
I just needed to use the little girls' room.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.592
Skip the teen drama. Get to it.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.136
Then I had to pretend
to use the bathroom...

01:36.304 --> 01:40.182
...even though I didn't really have to go,
because I'm a doofus.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.269
- Elena.
- Hey.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.397
I saw you with Matt. Are you okay?

01:48.274 --> 01:51.610
Yeah.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.112
Whatever.

01:56.449 --> 02:00.661
You're good. What gave me away?
Was it the hair, or was it my clothes?

02:01.538 --> 02:03.413
I know Elena's at...

02:03.581 --> 02:06.208
I know Elena's at home.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.043
I need you to deliver a message.

02:08.752 --> 02:09.794
What was the message?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.506
Tell Damon and Stefan
that I want the moonstone...

02:12.674 --> 02:15.467
...or I will rip this town apart
until it rains blood.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.928
Tell him the rest of it.

02:18.096 --> 02:22.141
Tonight, at the masquerade ball.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.559
She wants to do it public.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.562
- Killing Mason threw her off guard.
DAMON: She's running scared.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.898
- What she did to Jenna was desperate.
- We can't underestimate her.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.402
- We have to play this smarter than her.
- Can't we give her the stone?

02:33.570 --> 02:36.280
No. Katherine's not getting dick.
I've had it.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.533
I'm gonna go to the ball,
and I'm gonna kill her.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.077
- You're not gonna kill her.
- Don't give me that.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.830
- You're not gonna kill her.
- Oh, really?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.790
Because I am.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.133
Easy.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.593
- Okay.
- Grab the door, Jer.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.346
- Okay, stop fussing. I'm fine.
- The doctor said to take it easy.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.099
You don't wanna rip your stitches,
hemorrhage and die.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.727
The only thing I'm gonna die from
is embarrassment.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.563
- No.
- I walked into a knife.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.690
How does somebody do that?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.109
- It was a freak accident.
- Yeah. It happens.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.070
Yeah, I mean,
I've done it like 20 times at the Grill.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.072
Okay, I'm being nice.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.159
- Hey, careful.
- All right. Easy.

[SIGHS]

03:24.454 --> 03:26.288
- What should I do with this?
ELENA: I got it.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.298
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Make lunch.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.549
About Katherine.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.094
- We're not gonna do anything, Jeremy.
- She tried to kill Jenna.

03:41.262 --> 03:45.224
- We can't let her get away with that.
- Yes. If it keeps us safe, then we can.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.976
What if she tries something else?

03:48.144 --> 03:52.231
She won't. Katherine hurt Jenna
because I didn't do what she said.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.317
Well, I'm doing it now.
Me and Stefan are over.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.986
She wins. The end.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.281
You're being naive, and you know it.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.033
- Where are you going?
- Out.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.993
I'll be back.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.961
Where should I put these?

04:14.629 --> 04:18.257
Right there. Thank you, Miss Flowers.
You've been such a wonderful help.

04:18.423 --> 04:22.302
It's my pleasure, dear. Let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

Don't attack a witch.

- I'm glad you made it.
- You called, I came.

- Like you had a choice.
- Now, don't get all boss-lady on me.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.420
You know I love you.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.214
Hmm.

- To a masquerade ball.

Tonight.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.015
You wanna be my date?

05:10.893 --> 05:13.270
- Hey. Come on in.
- I got Stefan's message.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.605
Hey. You brought the Grimoire.
Thank you.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.066
What's going on?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.819
We're gonna kill Katherine.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.947
- I can explain.
- Please.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.242
We're gonna kill Katherine.

Now, this works with compressed air.

Trigger mechanism here.
I've got two of these in a different size.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.628
Now, for you, I recommend this.

05:39.630 --> 05:43.592
Fits nicely under a jacket sleeve. Here's
the trigger. And when you're ready:

05:44.719 --> 05:45.886
[GRUNTS]

05:47.472 --> 05:50.599
You wanted me to show you
how to kill a vampire, so...

05:50.767 --> 05:52.684
What's with the hair?

05:52.852 --> 05:56.855
I'm impersonating my dull-as-dishwater
doppelgänger, Elena.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.816
- She has the worst taste.
- Except in men.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.072
Isn't it a risk pretending to be her
in front of the entire town?

06:05.239 --> 06:08.867
I've gotten quite good at it, actually,
and everyone's gonna be in masks.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.327
Mm-mm.

06:10.495 --> 06:14.831
It's for some feed-the-something charity.
It's for a good cause, Lucy.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.794
Ha, ha. Okay. Well, have you actually seen
the moonstone before?

06:18.961 --> 06:21.671
- I thought it was some made-up legend.
- I have seen it.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.673
I need you to help me get it back.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.385
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do with it?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.183
You want me to break the curse.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.772
Let's just get it first.
What I really need is for backup.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.609
I can't imagine that Damon and Stefan
are just gonna hand it over...

06:42.777 --> 06:44.236
...without putting up a fight.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.697
I know you love Elena, and you wanna
be with her, but it's risky.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.449
Too many people can get hurt.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.202
Look, I want Elena back, yes,
but it's more than that.

06:52.370 --> 06:56.206
I mean, what Katherine did to Jenna,
it crossed a line. She has to be stopped.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.875
- I don't know, Stefan.
- Look, Katherine knows me.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.546
She knows I'm not gonna try something
in a crowd full of innocent people.

07:02.713 --> 07:06.049
So that gives me an edge.
I can catch her by surprise.

07:08.719 --> 07:12.764
I could do a spell to trap her.
Like the tomb spell.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.809
Right. We can isolate her
away from the others.

There's something I gotta do.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.754
Just something. I can't talk about it.
But I've gotta go.

- Yeah. Me in a suit.

You look good in a suit.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.226
I don't think so, Matt.

There's so much about me and Stefan
that'll never work.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.110
You know I'm here for you always.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.572
Are you sure
you don't want me there?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.658
No. Stay with Elena.
I don't want her to know about this.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.120
Okay. Well, I'll make sure
she doesn't leave my sight.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.500
All right. If anybody wants to back out,
I'll understand.

there are no werewolves running around.

he won't turn.
