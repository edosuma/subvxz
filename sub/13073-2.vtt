- Whoo-oh.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.787
- Whoo-oh!

20:55.854 --> 20:59.324
[groans] Are we dead?

20:59.391 --> 21:00.926
- [sighs] No.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.294
But we might as well be.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.262
We're never going to
be together again.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.497
It's hopeless.

21:05.564 --> 21:09.267
- Yeah, might as well
go our separate ways.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.436
- Take care, kid,
we had a good run.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.139
- You know, you've always
been like a brother to me.

21:14.206 --> 21:17.542
- Oh, Foo, I could
punch you right now.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.480
- [gasps]

21:21.546 --> 21:24.983
- [gasps] Foo!
- Fee!

21:25.050 --> 21:26.151
- BOTH: [laughing]

21:26.218 --> 21:27.219
- We did it!

21:27.285 --> 21:28.920
- I'm so glad
we're back together.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.188
And also not dead.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.491
- Oh my gosh, you
guys are cured.

21:32.557 --> 21:36.194
See, the static explosion must
have been enough to depolarize--

21:36.261 --> 21:37.329
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.464
Glad to have you back, dude.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.099
- [shock]
- Hey!

21:41.166 --> 21:42.200
Yeah, you better run.

21:42.267 --> 21:43.235
I'm gonna get you.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.970
- [laughing]

21:45.037 --> 21:49.841
- Okay, guys, I think I'm gonna
go ahead and go back to bed now.

21:49.908 --> 21:52.077
I'm just gonna--no, no!

21:52.144 --> 21:54.112
Ah, ah, no, stop it!

21:54.179 --> 21:55.714
- FOO: [laughing]

21:55.781 --> 21:58.083
- HARVEY: No, no,
seriously, I--ow!
