You're so lost you couldn't even trust
the one person who loved you the most.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.280
You planted those notes.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.553
If you are the scorpion,
then I am the sting.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.598
And who does a scorpion sting
when she runs out of victims?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.193
Herself.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

38:09.960 --> 38:12.076
Power has made you predictable.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.630
| remember when you used
to fight for something more.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.916
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

38:30.320 --> 38:32.516
(WHIRRING)

38:39.920 --> 38:41.513
That won't work with me.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.391
Guess you'll have to fight fair.

38:46.680 --> 38:47.795
Hmph.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.799
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(GRUNTING)

39:52.440 --> 39:53.953
(WHIRRING)

40:18.720 --> 40:20.996
Like Bajie said,
you're your own worst enemy.

(GRUNTING)

40:56.240 --> 40:58.151
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

41:05.640 --> 41:07.836
You are the darkness.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.149
(SPLUTTERING)

41:10.200 --> 41:12.760
And I am the light within you.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.480
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

41:15.560 --> 41:17.358
For years, you tried to snuff me out,

41:17.440 --> 41:20.114
afraid to be exposed
to what you really are.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.554
A tyrant.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.596
(GASPING IN PAIN)
