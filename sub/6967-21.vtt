WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.134
Man #1 : You're supposed to be
in charge here, Perkins.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.695
Man #2:
I am in charge.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.765
Man #1 : These men want answers.
They want to know what your plan is.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.777
This thing could kill us all.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.780
Man #2: We should have left
two days ago. No one would listen to me.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.715
Man #1 : Nobody knew what it was
two days ago. Nobody knows now.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.217
Somebody has to go for help.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.776
What are the rest of us
supposed to do?

00:21.855 --> 00:22.981
Wait for help?

00:23.056 --> 00:24.489
Someone has to chance it...

00:24.557 --> 00:25.819
and hike out.

00:25.892 --> 00:29.828
That person might not make
the road before nightfall.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.158
Then what?

00:31.231 --> 00:32.823
I say we run for it.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.298
Split up,
take our chances.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.891
It's suicide, Dyer.

00:35.969 --> 00:36.958
Fine.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.300
You stay here.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.363
Tell us how it turns out.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.673
(Panting)

01:25.819 --> 01:27.218
(Grunting)

01:27.287 --> 01:30.279
(Labored Breathing)

01:36.262 --> 01:37.627
I think it's broken.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.494
You got to get up.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.658
I can't make it.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.465
(Groaning)

01:46.539 --> 01:47.972
We got to keep moving.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.235
(Grunting)

01:49.309 --> 01:51.300
We're not going to make it.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.905
(Distant Humming)

01:55.815 --> 01:58.010
(Humming Growing Louder)

02:05.291 --> 02:06.815
(Dyer Screaming)

02:56.608 --> 02:58.633
Take a good look, Scully.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.109
What am I looking at?

03:00.178 --> 03:02.408
30 loggers working
a clear-cutting contract...

03:02.481 --> 03:03.914
in Washington State--

03:03.982 --> 03:05.244
rugged, manly men...

03:05.317 --> 03:07.376
in the full bloom
of their manhood.

03:07.452 --> 03:09.147
What am I looking for?

03:09.221 --> 03:13.055
Anything strange, unexplainable,
unlikely, boyfriend--

03:13.125 --> 03:14.717
I don't know.

03:14.793 --> 03:15.953
I give up, Mulder.

03:16.028 --> 03:18.861
Funny. That's what
the Federal Forest Service...

03:18.931 --> 03:20.159
has done as well.

03:20.232 --> 03:21.824
Why? What happened to them?

03:21.900 --> 03:23.561
In a word, they vanished.

03:23.635 --> 03:25.296
Or so it would appear.

03:26.905 --> 03:28.896
This is Doug Spinney
and Steven Teague.

03:28.974 --> 03:30.805
They call themselves
"monkey wrenchers."

03:30.876 --> 03:33.208
They drive spikes into trees...

03:33.278 --> 03:35.769
sabotage logging equipment,
and make life miserable...

03:35.847 --> 03:38.111
for lumberjacks
and lumber mills.

03:38.183 --> 03:41.277
Ecoterrorists--
militant environmentalists.

03:41.353 --> 03:42.684
Right. Two weeks ago...

03:42.754 --> 03:44.688
the loggers radioed a message...

03:44.756 --> 03:47.691
that Spinney and Teague
had gone on a spree...

03:47.759 --> 03:50.956
sabotaging equipment,
causing general mischief.

03:51.029 --> 03:52.018
One week later...

03:52.097 --> 03:54.122
all radio communication
was cut off.

03:54.199 --> 03:55.632
Do they know why?

03:55.701 --> 03:57.692
No. The lumber company...

03:57.769 --> 04:00.829
asked the Federal Forest Service
to look into it.

04:00.906 --> 04:04.273
Two officials went in last week.
No one has heard from them.

04:04.343 --> 04:06.277
It appears as if
these monkey wrenchers...

04:06.345 --> 04:07.972
are doing more than
mischief making.

04:08.046 --> 04:11.038
That's what the lumber company
and forest service are accusing.

04:11.116 --> 04:13.107
They've asked the FBI
to investigate.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.745
I had to pull strings
to get the case.

04:15.821 --> 04:17.254
An ecoterrorism case?

04:17.322 --> 04:19.187
Do I dare ask why?

04:19.257 --> 04:23.421
In 1 934, long before anyone knew
what an ecoterrorist was...

04:23.495 --> 04:24.792
a WPA crew...

04:24.863 --> 04:27.889
working that same area
vanished without a trace.

04:27.966 --> 04:31.299
None of those men was ever found
or heard from again.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.804
And you suspect what, Bigfoot?

04:33.872 --> 04:35.203
Not likely.

04:35.273 --> 04:38.174
That's a lot of flannel
to be choking down...

04:38.243 --> 04:39.870
even for Bigfoot.

04:39.945 --> 04:43.073
Come on. It will be
a nice trip to the forest.

05:09.841 --> 05:14.938
Hi. Fox Mulder, Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.776
Larry Moore,
Federal Forest Service.

05:16.848 --> 05:19.408
You can put your gear
in the truck.

05:20.919 --> 05:22.910
Must be pretty rugged
where we're going.

05:22.988 --> 05:24.455
Yeah.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.923
Is that a bullet hole
in your windshield?

05:26.992 --> 05:28.687
.22 caliber.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.091
Somebody shot at you?

05:30.162 --> 05:32.722
There's not much
to hunt around here...

05:32.798 --> 05:34.561
with that ammo
except Freddies.

05:34.633 --> 05:35.622
"Freddies" ?

05:35.701 --> 05:37.692
Employees of
the Federal Forest Service.

05:37.769 --> 05:39.737
It's what ecoterrorists call us.

05:39.805 --> 05:42.603
Is that who you think
shot at you?

05:42.674 --> 05:45.609
Let me get this
out of the way.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.544
I have no quarrel
with ecoterrorists in principle.

05:48.613 --> 05:50.604
I'm as concerned
for this forest...

05:50.682 --> 05:52.582
and the environment as anybody.

05:52.651 --> 05:54.585
It's their methods
I can't condone.

05:54.653 --> 05:57.121
Do you think
they'd kill a man?

05:57.189 --> 05:59.783
There's 30 men up there
unaccounted for...

05:59.858 --> 06:01.792
each with survival experience.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.885
Something happened to them.

06:06.231 --> 06:07.664
Sorry I'm late.

06:07.733 --> 06:10.224
I was down talking
to Bob Perkins' wife.

06:10.302 --> 06:12.293
He's one of our missing loggers.

06:12.370 --> 06:13.632
Hey, Larry.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.798
Steve Humphreys,
head of security...

06:15.874 --> 06:16.966
for Schiff-Immergut
Lumber.

06:17.042 --> 06:18.066
Mulder. Scully.

06:18.143 --> 06:20.441
We've got a four-hour drive
ahead of us--

06:20.512 --> 06:22.503
Plenty of time
to get acquainted.

06:22.581 --> 06:23.912
Get the impression...

06:23.982 --> 06:25.973
we've walked into
the middle of a war...

06:26.051 --> 06:27.575
that's already started?

06:36.762 --> 06:38.252
Why do these men...

06:38.330 --> 06:40.491
work so far up
in the wilderness?

06:40.565 --> 06:41.827
That's where the trees are.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.595
You're kidding, right?

06:43.668 --> 06:45.533
No. Environmentalists
have made sure...

06:45.604 --> 06:47.697
that all the land here
is untouchable.

06:47.773 --> 06:50.298
We take our timber
where we can get it.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.071
Even then, we plant saplings
for every tree we take.

06:53.145 --> 06:55.079
So why do ecoterrorists
target you?

06:55.147 --> 06:57.672
Tree huggers
are like the boys...

06:57.749 --> 07:00.547
who went up to Canada
during the Vietnam War.

07:00.619 --> 07:03.281
They're cowardly,
and so are their tactics.

07:04.489 --> 07:05.857
Damn it.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.958
Homemade tire spike.

07:08.025 --> 07:10.016
Clear through the sidewall.

07:10.094 --> 07:11.083
It's unfixable.

07:11.162 --> 07:12.151
You got a spare?

07:12.230 --> 07:13.788
Humphreys:
Right tire's history too.

07:14.966 --> 07:16.991
Monkey wrenchers call it
a caltrop.

07:17.068 --> 07:19.400
Roads back here
are littered with them.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.835
Indiscriminate terrorism.

07:20.905 --> 07:22.395
Can you imagine somebody...

07:22.473 --> 07:24.737
spiking the roads
of Washington, D.C.?

07:24.809 --> 07:26.868
How much sympathy
would they get?

07:26.944 --> 07:29.412
So how are we going
to get to the camp?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.471
We're going to have to hike.

08:28.139 --> 08:29.629
Anybody here?

08:35.813 --> 08:37.576
Someone forgot
to clean their plate.

08:37.648 --> 08:40.582
Scully: Looks like
they left in a hurry too.

08:49.293 --> 08:51.227
They forgot to pack.

08:57.835 --> 08:58.824
Find anything?

08:58.903 --> 08:59.892
Party favors.

08:59.971 --> 09:01.905
Vehicles have all been
monkey wrenched.

09:01.973 --> 09:03.304
Power generator's busted.

09:03.374 --> 09:05.740
Somebody really turned
this place upside down.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.506
Whoever did it didn't want
the fact broadcast, either.

09:19.357 --> 09:21.086
Radiators are all full of rice.

09:21.158 --> 09:23.490
Looks like sugar or sand
in all the crankcases.

09:23.561 --> 09:25.552
They really did a number here.

09:25.629 --> 09:28.359
The sun's going down
in an hour and a half.

09:28.432 --> 09:30.559
Better look around
before it gets dark.

09:30.634 --> 09:32.864
I'll see if I can get
that generator working.

09:32.937 --> 09:34.928
You were right
about one thing.

09:35.006 --> 09:36.098
What's that?

09:36.173 --> 09:38.198
Definitely wasn't Bigfoot.

09:59.196 --> 10:00.663
Look at that.

10:00.731 --> 10:02.790
Scully:
What is it?

10:04.802 --> 10:06.793
Moore:
It looks like a hive.

10:06.871 --> 10:09.305
Maybe a cocoon of some kind.

10:09.373 --> 10:10.635
Made by what?

10:10.708 --> 10:11.697
I don't know.

10:11.776 --> 10:13.641
I've never seen
anything like it.

10:23.754 --> 10:25.085
Got it.

10:25.156 --> 10:26.316
Can you cut it down?

10:27.658 --> 10:29.649
Yeah, I think so.

10:40.004 --> 10:41.335
You all right, Scully?

11:08.332 --> 11:09.492
Scully:
Oh, God.

11:18.342 --> 11:20.503
It feels, uh...

11:20.578 --> 11:23.012
it feels desiccated,
hard and dry...

11:23.081 --> 11:25.106
almost preserved.

11:25.183 --> 11:26.514
Like it's been embalmed.

11:26.584 --> 11:29.348
No, more like the fluids
have been bled...

11:29.420 --> 11:30.887
from its body.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.253
Almost like it's been cured.

11:33.324 --> 11:35.622
I think...

11:35.693 --> 11:37.285
it's a male.

11:37.361 --> 11:38.851
Barely.

11:38.930 --> 11:42.127
I'd say it's some kind
of spider's nest...

11:42.200 --> 11:44.395
or insect cocoon.

11:44.469 --> 11:47.233
What kind of insect
could have gotten a man...

11:47.305 --> 11:49.364
all the way up
into that tree?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.738
Itsy-bitsy spider.

12:01.185 --> 12:03.119
(Creaking)

12:31.716 --> 12:33.513
(Clanking)

12:52.036 --> 12:53.469
Don't move.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.369
Who are you?

12:59.777 --> 13:00.709
Doug Spinney.

13:00.778 --> 13:02.439
I ought to shoot you.

13:02.513 --> 13:04.378
Might as well
shoot yourself too.

13:04.448 --> 13:06.473
You're in a spot
to be testing me.

13:06.551 --> 13:08.280
What happened to my men?

13:08.352 --> 13:09.341
What men?

13:09.420 --> 13:11.718
The men who were
working this camp.

13:13.324 --> 13:14.757
I don't know.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.315
Probably the same thing...

13:16.394 --> 13:18.555
will happen to us
when the sun goes down.

13:18.629 --> 13:20.062
What are you doing?

13:20.131 --> 13:21.462
This animal's Doug Spinney.

13:21.532 --> 13:23.659
He's responsible
for all the monkey wrenching.

13:23.734 --> 13:24.996
He's probably a murderer.

13:25.069 --> 13:26.195
I'm no murderer.

13:26.270 --> 13:27.259
You're a liar.

13:27.338 --> 13:28.896
Let's hear him out.

13:28.973 --> 13:32.033
If we stand around,
there will be nothing left to say.

13:32.109 --> 13:34.976
Think about getting
that generator started.

13:35.046 --> 13:36.980
Darkness is our enemy.

13:37.048 --> 13:39.039
What's he talking about?

13:39.116 --> 13:41.414
Someone want to give me a hand?

13:41.485 --> 13:42.611
Now he's giving orders?

13:42.687 --> 13:43.881
I'm the one...

13:43.955 --> 13:45.479
who fixed the damn thing.

13:45.556 --> 13:46.989
Mulder:
It's all right.

13:55.066 --> 13:57.591
Why did you say
that darkness was our enemy?

13:59.203 --> 14:00.864
That's when they come.

14:00.938 --> 14:02.428
When who comes?

14:03.975 --> 14:05.909
I don't know what it is.

14:05.977 --> 14:08.912
They come from the sky,
take a man right off his feet...

14:08.980 --> 14:10.379
and devour him alive.

14:10.448 --> 14:12.245
I saw it happen.

14:12.316 --> 14:13.442
Happen to who?

14:13.517 --> 14:15.348
(Engine Sputtering)

14:15.419 --> 14:16.852
(Idling Smoothly)

14:16.921 --> 14:18.354
I need to eat.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.356
I haven't eaten in three days.

14:23.961 --> 14:25.952
What kind of B.S. story
is that, huh?

14:26.030 --> 14:27.691
You believe that?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.865
We found something
in the forest.

14:30.935 --> 14:31.902
What?

14:31.969 --> 14:33.903
A man caught in some kind...

14:33.971 --> 14:35.233
of insect cocoon.

14:40.044 --> 14:41.534
What happened here?

14:42.647 --> 14:45.115
We camped two valleys over,
four of us.

14:45.182 --> 14:46.240
Three now.

14:46.317 --> 14:48.080
More rats in the woodpile.

14:49.854 --> 14:51.788
Our truck has a dead battery.

14:51.856 --> 14:54.120
We drew straws to see
who would make the hike...

14:54.191 --> 14:55.954
to steal one
from the loggers.

14:56.027 --> 14:58.018
Why not just hike out?

14:58.095 --> 14:59.460
It's over a day's hike.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.021
No way we wanted to be caught
in the forest after dark...

15:02.099 --> 15:04.090
not after
what happened to Teague.

15:04.168 --> 15:06.932
That's the man you said
was devoured alive?

15:07.004 --> 15:07.993
Yeah.

15:08.072 --> 15:10.302
Why are you out here?

15:10.374 --> 15:11.807
Camping.

15:11.876 --> 15:14.743
The kind of camping you do
is a federal offense.

15:14.812 --> 15:17.007
Just hold off a second, okay?

15:17.081 --> 15:18.343
No, he's right.

15:18.416 --> 15:20.350
This man
is an admitted felon.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.817
He could be arrested.

15:21.886 --> 15:24.946
What about your offense,
my friend, huh?

15:25.022 --> 15:27.286
What about your offense
against nature?

15:27.358 --> 15:29.383
We operate within the law.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.621
We pay for the right
to take those trees.

15:31.696 --> 15:34.824
Well, your logging crew
is taking trees...

15:34.899 --> 15:36.867
that are marked and protected...

15:36.934 --> 15:39.801
so don't talk to me
about breaking the law...

15:39.870 --> 15:41.497
sir.

15:41.572 --> 15:42.937
They've taken marked trees?

15:43.007 --> 15:44.838
Yes, sir, marked in orange.

15:44.909 --> 15:46.137
Old growth trees?

15:46.210 --> 15:49.145
You know anything
about that, Steve?

15:49.213 --> 15:50.544
No.

15:54.051 --> 15:56.485
You going to take
this man's word...

15:56.554 --> 15:58.385
over mine?

15:59.924 --> 16:02.722
You don't want to go
out in the night.

16:02.793 --> 16:04.784
Take my word on that.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.395
It's out there.

16:07.465 --> 16:08.864
If I go out that door...

16:08.933 --> 16:12.699
something's going to eat me
and spin me in its web?

16:12.770 --> 16:14.738
Yes.

16:14.805 --> 16:16.966
It's too polite to come in here...

16:17.041 --> 16:18.474
and get me?

16:18.542 --> 16:21.306
For some reason,
it's, uh, afraid of the light.

16:21.379 --> 16:23.006
It's afraid of the light.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.981
There may be something
to what he's saying, Steve.

16:26.050 --> 16:29.816
He's a murderer, clever enough
to make up a story like that...

16:29.887 --> 16:32.879
even whip up that cocoon
to save a few trees...

16:32.957 --> 16:35.482
and I'm going
to prove I'm right.

16:38.062 --> 16:40.053
This is ridiculous.

16:48.005 --> 16:49.370
Where is it, Spinney?

16:51.075 --> 16:55.011
I thought it was going
to come and devour me.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.342
Humphreys:
Here I am!

16:57.415 --> 17:00.350
(Zapping)

17:00.418 --> 17:02.511
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

17:05.356 --> 17:09.053
Aw, don't be shy.
Come on.

17:09.126 --> 17:10.115
Huh?

17:12.329 --> 17:14.319
It's just like I told you.

17:14.397 --> 17:17.333
There's nothing out here
but a bunch of trees...

17:17.401 --> 17:20.063
that this man values
more than human life.

17:20.137 --> 17:23.231
I'm going to see him
tried on murder charges.

17:25.943 --> 17:27.934
What do you think?

17:28.012 --> 17:29.946
I think
I'm going to suggest...

17:30.014 --> 17:32.175
that we sleep
with the lights on.

17:32.249 --> 17:34.240
(Sighs)

17:45.830 --> 17:47.631
(Zapping)

17:56.206 --> 17:57.935
You see this Douglas fir?

17:58.008 --> 17:59.999
It's been standing here
since before time...

18:00.076 --> 18:02.010
and your men cut it down.

18:02.078 --> 18:03.670
Scully:
Who marks these trees?

18:03.747 --> 18:05.009
Federal Forest Service.

18:05.081 --> 18:07.015
You're only supposed
to cut trees...

18:07.083 --> 18:08.072
with a blue X.

18:08.151 --> 18:10.142
Mulder:
It must be hundreds of years old.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.417
Scully: Must get a lot of lumber
from a tree like this.

18:13.490 --> 18:15.890
Thousands of board feet.
Hell of a lot easier...

18:15.959 --> 18:17.984
than taking a lot
of smaller, younger trees.

18:18.061 --> 18:20.052
Monkey wrenchers
like Spinney here...

18:20.130 --> 18:21.995
are not above marking trees...

18:22.065 --> 18:23.259
with their own paint.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.733
This tree's 500 years old
if it's a day.

18:25.802 --> 18:26.791
Mulder:
Look at this.

18:28.371 --> 18:30.362
What would this represent?

18:33.276 --> 18:36.370
I don't know. I've never seen
a ring like that before.

18:36.446 --> 18:38.971
Those center rings
are older rings, right?

18:39.049 --> 18:41.984
Yeah. Every ring represents
a season of growth.

18:42.052 --> 18:43.610
And you see these?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.552
These are 500, 600 years old.

18:45.622 --> 18:49.114
They're a recorded history
of rainfall and climate.

18:49.192 --> 18:51.160
But this one, I don't know.

18:51.227 --> 18:53.161
I should take a core sample.

18:53.229 --> 18:55.356
We finished
with this nature walk?

18:55.432 --> 18:57.559
What happened
to those loggers?

18:57.634 --> 18:59.158
We're determining that.

18:59.235 --> 19:00.862
Don't you think...

19:00.937 --> 19:03.064
you should be
interrogating this man?

19:03.139 --> 19:04.538
I don't think he did it.

19:04.607 --> 19:06.131
I want him arrested.

19:06.209 --> 19:07.335
He's not leaving.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.207
No, not with a gun on him.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.747
What happens
if his three buddies show up...

19:11.815 --> 19:13.806
and do to you what they did...

19:13.883 --> 19:16.351
to those two federal
forest officials?

19:16.419 --> 19:18.751
I just want to take
a core sample.

19:18.822 --> 19:22.519
I got families who want
some answers about loved ones...

19:22.592 --> 19:24.924
answers not found
in that tree.

19:24.994 --> 19:27.690
The only crime is
the death of that tree.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.925
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

19:33.570 --> 19:34.594
Where you going?

19:34.671 --> 19:36.662
I'm hiking down to your truck...

19:36.740 --> 19:38.731
and get some people up here...

19:38.808 --> 19:40.332
who will take action.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.707
Steve!

19:41.778 --> 19:42.767
Let him go.

19:42.846 --> 19:44.780
Let him find out for himself.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.186
This is odd.

19:52.489 --> 19:54.923
This yellow ring's
got something living in it...

19:54.991 --> 19:56.788
some kind of...

19:56.860 --> 19:58.259
tiny bug.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.228
It doesn't make sense.

20:01.297 --> 20:02.423
Why not?

20:02.499 --> 20:05.935
Well, parasites attack
a tree in a variety of ways...

20:06.002 --> 20:07.993
but they always attack
the living parts:

20:08.071 --> 20:10.972
the leaves, the roots,
the new growth rings.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.975
Even if they're borers
of some kind...

20:14.043 --> 20:17.103
they wouldn't be working
so deep in the tree.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.410
Maybe the wood
in this ring is different.

20:19.482 --> 20:21.712
They seem to be
feeding on it.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.252
Can you identify them?

20:23.319 --> 20:25.048
It's a wood mite of some kind.

20:25.121 --> 20:29.251
Could they have been living
in that tree for hundreds of years?

20:29.325 --> 20:31.555
No. Inner rings
are dead wood.

20:31.628 --> 20:33.823
The tree's vascular system...

20:33.897 --> 20:35.888
is limited
to the outer few rings.

20:35.965 --> 20:38.024
They need water to survive.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.899
They appear to be hatching
out of the wood.

20:40.970 --> 20:44.462
Maybe when you
drew out this core...

20:44.541 --> 20:46.406
you tapped into a larger nest.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.137
Spinney:
Can they build a cocoon?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.678
Right after that tree was
cut down is when Teague died.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.742
It's about the same time that
the loggers disappeared too.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.754
You think these mites
killed the men?

20:58.822 --> 21:02.019
Maybe they been dormant
for hundreds of years.

21:02.091 --> 21:05.026
Maybe they woke up hungry.

21:31.554 --> 21:32.919
Damn it!

21:32.989 --> 21:34.980
(Sighs)

22:08.358 --> 22:11.293
(Humming)

22:20.336 --> 22:21.769
All right,
you monkey wrenchers...

22:21.838 --> 22:22.862
come on out now.

22:27.744 --> 22:30.110
I know what you're up to!

22:45.828 --> 22:48.524
(Humming)

23:26.135 --> 23:27.727
(Horn Honks)

23:50.126 --> 23:52.890
(Grunting)

24:00.103 --> 24:04.474
(Screaming)

24:05.441 --> 24:09.673
(Idling Smoothly)

24:12.748 --> 24:15.979
Humphreys should have been
back by now.

24:16.052 --> 24:18.486
These bugs
aren't moving anymore.

24:18.554 --> 24:21.455
They're either dead,
or they're asleep.

24:21.524 --> 24:25.221
It's the light.
They don't like the light.

24:25.294 --> 24:27.922
Scully: Usually,
bugs are attracted to light.

24:27.997 --> 24:31.364
Spinney: These obviously
are not your ordinary bugs...

24:31.434 --> 24:33.561
to say the least.

24:33.636 --> 24:35.536
Do you know insects, Scully?

24:36.739 --> 24:39.299
Uh,just what I learned
in my biology courses.

24:39.375 --> 24:42.344
They're the foundation
of our ecosystem.

24:42.411 --> 24:44.538
There are lots of them,
something like...

24:44.614 --> 24:46.741
200 million per person.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.875
They've been around a long time?

24:48.951 --> 24:51.249
Yeah, something like
600 million years--

24:51.320 --> 24:53.345
before the dinosaurs. Why?

24:53.422 --> 24:56.084
This tree is what,
600, 7 00 years old?

24:56.158 --> 24:57.489
Yeah.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.324
These rings represent
a history of climatic changes...

25:00.396 --> 25:04.093
which means that, in this year
in the life of the tree...

25:04.166 --> 25:07.192
there was some strange event
that produced an abnormal ring.

25:07.270 --> 25:08.737
Like what, exactly?

25:08.804 --> 25:10.169
A volcanic eruption.

25:10.239 --> 25:12.503
This whole chain of mountains...

25:12.575 --> 25:15.009
running from Washington
to Oregon is active.

25:15.077 --> 25:16.601
Remember Mount St. Helens?

25:16.679 --> 25:19.375
Yeah. How does that
explain the bugs?

25:19.448 --> 25:22.076
After Mount St. Helens erupted,
there was radiation unleashed...

25:22.151 --> 25:24.119
from inside the Earth.

25:24.186 --> 25:26.313
Strange things started to grow.

25:26.389 --> 25:28.983
There's this lake where
they discovered an amoeba...

25:29.058 --> 25:31.049
that sucks a man's brains out.

25:31.127 --> 25:33.220
Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba.

25:33.296 --> 25:35.230
It's true. Spirit Lake.
There's documented cases...

25:35.298 --> 25:36.560
of infected swimmers.

25:36.632 --> 25:37.963
But an amoeba is...

25:38.034 --> 25:40.229
a single-celled organism
that can be mutated.

25:40.303 --> 25:42.567
An insect is a complex animal.

25:42.638 --> 25:46.096
A mutation
would take years to evolve.

25:46.175 --> 25:49.167
Maybe what we're dealing with
isn't a mutation at all.

25:49.245 --> 25:52.908
What if it's some kind
of extinct insect larvae...

25:52.982 --> 25:54.313
in that ring--

25:54.383 --> 25:56.442
deposited during
volcanic activity...

25:56.519 --> 25:58.987
brought up through
the tree's root system.

25:59.055 --> 26:00.522
Ancient insect eggs...

26:00.590 --> 26:02.683
thousands,
maybe millions of years old...

26:02.758 --> 26:03.884
lying dormant--

26:03.960 --> 26:06.793
Until those loggers
cut down that tree.

26:08.531 --> 26:11.898
That would be rather
poetic justice, don't you think...

26:11.968 --> 26:15.062
unleashing the very thing
that would end up killing them...

26:15.137 --> 26:17.731
and your friend Humphreys?

26:17.807 --> 26:19.570
And who knows?

26:19.642 --> 26:21.166
Maybe us.

26:23.079 --> 26:24.944
Sweet dreams.

26:28.718 --> 26:31.050
Humphreys might
have just hiked out of here.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.680
We don't know that he didn't.

26:33.756 --> 26:36.316
Maybe we're letting ourselves
get carried away...

26:36.392 --> 26:37.882
with this bug story.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.257
Yeah, maybe.

27:14.363 --> 27:19.300
(Idling Smoothly)

27:32.281 --> 27:33.839
Mulder:
Going somewhere?

27:33.916 --> 27:35.008
No, I was--

27:35.084 --> 27:36.210
Doing auto repair?

27:36.285 --> 27:38.947
You're planning
on cutting out.

27:39.021 --> 27:41.012
My friends
only had enough gas...

27:41.090 --> 27:44.218
to keep their generator
running 20 hours.

27:44.293 --> 27:46.284
They'll die
if I don't get back.

27:46.362 --> 27:47.351
Why sneak around?

27:47.430 --> 27:50.092
The forest service guy
wouldn't go for it.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.531
He'd never trust me.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.091
He's got no reason to.
Neither do I.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.604
I can save us all.
We've got a Jeep.

27:56.672 --> 27:59.607
It's just two valleys over.
It needs a battery.

27:59.675 --> 28:01.438
I can be back in the morning.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.569
We can all drive out tomorrow.

28:06.949 --> 28:08.917
You got to trust me, man.

28:19.195 --> 28:20.787
Mulder:
Radio's back up.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.225
It's working?

28:26.302 --> 28:28.236
I'm not getting
any reception...

28:28.304 --> 28:30.238
so the receiver
could be trashed.

28:30.306 --> 28:32.797
What about transmissions?
Can you send a message?

28:32.875 --> 28:34.365
I could try.

28:35.478 --> 28:37.241
This is a call for help.

28:37.313 --> 28:39.406
Is there anyone
at this frequency?

28:44.653 --> 28:46.587
This is Special Agent Mulder
of the FBI.

28:46.655 --> 28:49.590
We have an emergency
and a possible quarantine.

28:49.658 --> 28:51.182
Our position is--

28:58.334 --> 28:59.969
(Generator Dies)

29:01.003 --> 29:02.664
What happened to the generator?

29:02.738 --> 29:03.727
I turned it off.

29:03.806 --> 29:06.001
Turn it back on.
The radio's working.

29:06.075 --> 29:07.599
Where's the gas can?

29:07.676 --> 29:09.405
Spinney took it.

29:09.478 --> 29:11.241
He took it?

29:11.313 --> 29:13.144
You mean he's gone?

29:13.215 --> 29:16.184
He left earlier.
He took a battery and gas.

29:16.251 --> 29:17.377
He's coming back.

29:17.453 --> 29:19.512
He gave his personal guarantee?

29:19.588 --> 29:21.783
He gave me his word, yeah.

29:21.857 --> 29:26.453
The man who gave you his word
has made an art out of sabotage...

29:26.528 --> 29:29.520
and defying authority,
and is probably the man...

29:29.598 --> 29:31.589
who put that bullet
through my windshield.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.396
What would you have done?

29:33.469 --> 29:37.269
We've got one chance,
which is one more than we had.

29:37.339 --> 29:38.567
Or one less.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.073
What do you mean?

29:40.142 --> 29:42.542
He let Spinney take
the last of the gas.

29:42.611 --> 29:45.705
This generator's got
about a quarter tank left.

29:45.781 --> 29:47.715
What about the trucks?

29:47.783 --> 29:50.809
The tanks have been ruptured
or filled with sugar.

29:50.886 --> 29:54.287
By the man we are trusting
to come back for us.

29:54.356 --> 29:57.621
We got to get on the radio
and send a Mayday.

29:57.693 --> 29:59.285
Every drop of fuel...

29:59.361 --> 30:01.659
is going to keep
this gennie powered tonight.

30:01.730 --> 30:03.357
I don't want to wait...

30:03.432 --> 30:05.366
hoping somebody heard
that transmission...

30:05.434 --> 30:09.097
when this thing quits running
about 2:00 in the morning.

30:09.171 --> 30:10.331
Do you?

30:17.246 --> 30:18.474
(Sighs)

30:24.019 --> 30:26.010
(Groans)

30:37.566 --> 30:38.555
Mulder--

30:38.634 --> 30:40.966
It's done.
I shouldn't have let him go.

30:41.036 --> 30:43.197
Let's just move past it, okay?

30:44.706 --> 30:46.037
Fine.

30:46.108 --> 30:48.099
What do you suggest?

30:48.177 --> 30:50.042
I don't know.

30:50.112 --> 30:52.103
We'll think of something.

30:52.181 --> 30:54.843
I think we both
have a good idea...

30:54.917 --> 30:56.908
of what happened
to those loggers...

30:56.985 --> 30:59.852
and what happened
to the group in 1 934.

30:59.922 --> 31:01.617
They only found one cocoon.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.123
It's a big forest.

31:03.192 --> 31:04.716
What would you have done?

31:04.793 --> 31:08.422
Would I have made a decision myself
that affected us all?

31:08.497 --> 31:10.465
Cut the sanctimonious crap.

31:10.532 --> 31:12.796
What do you want me to say?

31:12.868 --> 31:14.631
We might die up here.

31:14.703 --> 31:17.433
If we're lucky, they'll find
our bodies spun up in a tree...

31:17.506 --> 31:20.634
or they may not
find us at all!

31:20.709 --> 31:24.645
You're right, and we're
wasting time arguing about it.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.962
What are you going to do?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.554
Button this place up.

31:43.632 --> 31:45.623
If we got to spend
the night in here...

31:45.701 --> 31:47.635
we got to do
everything we can...

31:47.703 --> 31:50.137
to make sure the bugs
stay out there.

32:03.318 --> 32:05.309
I'd be careful with that.

32:05.387 --> 32:07.378
It's the only bulb that works.

32:13.228 --> 32:17.221
(Idling Roughly)

32:53.302 --> 32:54.963
I can see them.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.374
You guys, look at this.

33:06.148 --> 33:08.139
Look. They're coming
through the wall...

33:08.217 --> 33:09.809
down where it's dark.

33:09.885 --> 33:11.648
You see them?

33:15.190 --> 33:16.680
(Gasps Softly)

33:17.859 --> 33:19.121
They're on me!

33:19.194 --> 33:20.252
Mulder:
It's all right.

33:20.329 --> 33:21.353
Scully, Scully--

33:21.430 --> 33:22.863
Get them off me!

33:22.931 --> 33:23.989
Whoa! Watch it!

33:24.066 --> 33:25.090
Stand still!

33:25.167 --> 33:26.429
Stop it!

33:26.501 --> 33:27.900
Can you see them?

33:27.970 --> 33:29.164
Get them off!

33:29.238 --> 33:30.899
They're not just on you.

33:30.973 --> 33:32.031
They're everywhere.

33:32.107 --> 33:34.098
That's what that residue is
over everything.

33:34.176 --> 33:36.110
I thought we were safe
in the light!

33:36.178 --> 33:37.475
We are!

33:37.546 --> 33:40.379
I think the light
keeps them from swarming.

33:40.449 --> 33:43.441
We'll be safe as long
as we stay in the light.

34:00.435 --> 34:03.836
(Idling Smoothly)

34:12.080 --> 34:14.605
How you feeling?

34:14.681 --> 34:16.114
I'm okay.

34:22.824 --> 34:24.757
They're oxidizing enzymes...

34:24.826 --> 34:26.521
just like fireflies.

34:29.197 --> 34:32.257
Maybe that's why
they cocoon their prey--

34:32.333 --> 34:34.858
so that they can oxidize
the proteins...

34:34.936 --> 34:37.427
taken from the fluids
in the body.

34:43.411 --> 34:45.402
What if the generator goes?

34:45.480 --> 34:48.574
Will they swarm in here
and drain the life out of us?

34:48.649 --> 34:50.879
We got an hour and a half
till sunrise.

34:50.952 --> 34:53.614
Then what? It's over
a day's hike out of here.

34:53.688 --> 34:55.985
We won't make it on foot
by nightfall.

34:56.056 --> 34:58.150
Maybe somebody
heard our transmission.

34:58.226 --> 35:00.160
Help could be on the way.

35:00.228 --> 35:02.219
You sent that call hours ago.

35:02.296 --> 35:05.424
I mean, help would have
been here by now.

35:07.435 --> 35:10.233
Well, I'm not going
to give up on Spinney.

35:10.304 --> 35:13.205
He gave me his word
he'd come back to get us.

35:13.274 --> 35:15.265
And if he doesn't?

35:15.343 --> 35:18.403
We'll think of something.

35:21.816 --> 35:23.909
(Idling Roughly)

35:29.056 --> 35:32.287
(Generator Sputtering)

35:34.195 --> 35:37.130
(Sputtering Increases)

35:38.966 --> 35:41.059
(Generator Dies)

36:10.631 --> 36:12.758
You got a patch kit
in your truck?

36:12.834 --> 36:14.131
Yeah.

36:14.202 --> 36:16.727
Maybe we can patch this
or get it to hold air.

36:16.804 --> 36:19.967
With the truck's spare, maybe we
can limp down the mountain.

36:22.643 --> 36:26.670
If not, we can get on the radio
and warn them what's out here.

36:42.163 --> 36:45.599
(Thunder Rumbling)

37:01.616 --> 37:02.878
Moore:
See it?

37:02.950 --> 37:04.212
Mulder:
Yeah.

37:16.697 --> 37:19.666
(Low Humming)

37:19.734 --> 37:21.292
Listen.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.234
You hear that?

37:23.304 --> 37:25.238
Moore:
It's a car.

37:29.977 --> 37:31.911
No. It's a Jeep.

37:35.516 --> 37:37.507
We got to move.
Let's go! Let's go!

37:37.585 --> 37:38.677
Wait!

37:38.753 --> 37:40.914
What about the body--
Humphreys' body?

37:41.989 --> 37:43.854
Leave it. I've radioed for help.

37:43.925 --> 37:45.153
Where are your friends?

37:45.226 --> 37:46.386
They didn't make it.

37:46.460 --> 37:47.586
We won't either...

37:47.662 --> 37:49.323
unless we haul ass.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.388
Let's go.
Come on.

38:28.135 --> 38:29.625
Spinney:
Oh!

38:31.973 --> 38:33.235
Damn it!

38:42.149 --> 38:43.582
Moore:
I don't believe it.

38:43.651 --> 38:47.087
You talk about
shooting yourself in the foot.

38:54.328 --> 38:55.590
(Yelling)

38:55.663 --> 38:57.494
Get out of there!
Get in the car!

38:57.565 --> 39:00.301
(Yelling)

39:27.094 --> 39:29.585
(Groaning)

39:34.635 --> 39:36.626
(Screaming)

40:25.719 --> 40:28.119
We have an emergency
evacuation situation.

40:28.188 --> 40:30.850
Requesting quarantine facility
for two...

40:30.924 --> 40:32.084
possibly three victims...

40:32.159 --> 40:34.150
with undiagnosed infection
or exposure...

40:34.228 --> 40:36.321
to unknown biological vectors.

40:36.397 --> 40:39.389
Repeat, that's an emergency
evacuation situation.

40:39.466 --> 40:41.525
Two, possibly three victims--

41:32.152 --> 41:34.017
How are you feeling?

41:34.087 --> 41:35.145
Better.

41:35.222 --> 41:37.156
How did the tests come back?

41:37.224 --> 41:39.818
Your respiratory charts
were good.

41:39.893 --> 41:41.087
We were concerned...

41:41.161 --> 41:43.629
about the damage
due to inhalation.

41:43.697 --> 41:45.688
There were large concentrations...

41:45.766 --> 41:47.757
of the chemical we determined
was luciferin.

41:47.835 --> 41:48.824
Which is what?

41:48.902 --> 41:51.370
The same enzyme
we find in fireflies...

41:51.438 --> 41:53.531
and other
bioluminescent insects.

41:53.607 --> 41:56.075
Our entomologists
are still trying to determine...

41:56.143 --> 41:57.576
the specific epithet...

41:57.644 --> 41:59.805
of the insects
you encountered.

42:02.649 --> 42:03.911
Scully?

42:08.655 --> 42:10.452
How's she doing?

42:10.524 --> 42:12.754
She's still not out of
the woods, so to speak.

42:12.826 --> 42:14.589
She lost a lot of fluids.

42:14.661 --> 42:17.858
Two or three more hours
of exposure...

42:17.931 --> 42:19.796
she might not
have made it.

42:19.867 --> 42:23.428
I told her it was going to be
a nice trip to the forest.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.206
How you going to contain it
to the forest?

42:30.844 --> 42:32.641
What if the swarm migrates?

42:32.713 --> 42:35.648
The government has initiated
eradication procedures.

42:35.716 --> 42:38.480
They're quite certain that,
by using a combination

42:38.552 --> 42:40.611
of controlled burns
and pesticides...

42:40.687 --> 42:42.882
they will be successful.

42:42.956 --> 42:44.480
And if they're not?

42:48.061 --> 42:50.723
That is not an option,
Mr. Mulder.

43:43.183 --> 43:44.980
I made this!
