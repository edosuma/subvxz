00:04.750 --> 00:06.375
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

00:06.667 --> 00:08.667
- What you got there?
- Our new baby monitor.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.333
Hey, you know, if one of us runs upstairs,
we could test it out right now.

00:12.792 --> 00:14.625
The one of us who is not pregnant.

00:16.667 --> 00:17.583
Hey, how about if I go?

00:17.667 --> 00:18.500
Mm-hm.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.291
Okay, all set!

00:23.375 --> 00:25.834
Amy: All righty, make baby noises.

00:25.917 --> 00:26.959
All right.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.792
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

00:34.583 --> 00:35.709
Uh-oh!

00:36.583 --> 00:38.667
My diapie is full!

00:40.625 --> 00:43.291
Will somebody please change me?

00:45.041 --> 00:46.333
Oh, man.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.875
I didn't think we'd have
to worry about this for years.

- Morning, boys.
- Morning.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.750
I'm in charge of breakfast today, dad.
What would you like?

01:52.834 --> 01:54.542
Twenty pounds of raw pig.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.333
You want toast with that?

01:58.917 --> 02:00.625
No, I need it for bait.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.250
Believe it or not, we've got a giant snake
loose in Sloan's lake.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.667
Look at that, an anaconda.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.625
What?

02:08.083 --> 02:10.166
How could an anaconda get to Denver?

02:10.250 --> 02:11.333
Who knows?

02:11.417 --> 02:15.750
Maybe some kid went to Florida
on vacation with his grandparents,

02:16.166 --> 02:17.458
brought a baby snake back.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.250
Maybe the kid named him snappy.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.834
Maybe when snappy got too big,
the kid freaked out

02:25.208 --> 02:26.125
and set him free.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.500
Just a guess.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.709
Anyway,

02:33.792 --> 02:35.750
this is the opportunity of a lifetime.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.208
I mean, if I can catch this snake,

02:37.291 --> 02:39.500
this is great publicity for the Triple BG.

02:39.583 --> 02:40.709
- Huh?
- What?

02:40.792 --> 02:42.208
Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.792
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, okay.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.959
Hey, dad, can I come with you?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.291
I'd love to see you get chased
by a giant snake.

02:48.375 --> 02:51.375
Hey! I'm gonna catch that giant snake.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.500
However it plays out,

02:52.583 --> 02:54.417
I just want to see something
catch something.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.959
So we've turned into that couple?

03:10.375 --> 03:11.709
- I love it!
- Me, too.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.208
- So about tonight--
- No, shh!

03:15.417 --> 03:16.250
I...

03:17.834 --> 03:19.000
Okay, coast is clear.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.583
Do we really have to be so secretive?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.208
Are you kidding?

03:22.291 --> 03:24.834
Do you have any idea what would happen
if my mom found out?

03:29.166 --> 03:31.959
Spencer: So when I pick you up tonight,
what do we say we're doing?

03:32.041 --> 03:33.625
Teddy: Don't worry.
I'll come up with something.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.208
I'm a pretty good actress.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.041
Okay, first of all,

03:39.125 --> 03:41.917
in this family, I am the greatest actress.

03:42.709 --> 03:45.500
Second of all, nobody fools Mama Ames.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.458
You bet.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.542
Now, Charlie, when you're Teddy's age,

03:49.625 --> 03:51.917
you're not going to try
to get away with stuff, are you?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.375
Yes, I will.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.000
Oh.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.041
Charlie, who's the greatest
actress in the family?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.625
You are, mommy.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.291
All better.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.625
PJ, we need to talk.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.583
I've got a dangerous mission for you.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.750
Mitch, I am not trying
the chocolate shake again.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.250
I need you to find out

04:25.375 --> 04:28.250
who is stealing chicken from the store.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.834
Why would someone steal our chicken?

04:30.333 --> 04:31.542
Haven't they tasted it?

04:32.625 --> 04:34.208
I don't know, but...

04:37.333 --> 04:39.417
Corporate is really busting my giblets
about this.

04:39.875 --> 04:43.750
So I am putting my best man on it.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.625
You.

04:46.709 --> 04:47.834
Oh, cool.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.667
Any idea who the thief is?

04:49.750 --> 04:52.667
Okay, I'm pretty sure it's an inside job.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.625
So, it could be Justin.

04:55.083 --> 05:00.000
Okay, your meal was three dollars
and you gave me a five, so...

05:00.834 --> 05:02.709
Don't help me. I got this.

05:04.083 --> 05:06.250
Then there's Val, the vegetarian...

05:07.000 --> 05:08.458
Here's your murdered chicken.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.917
And finally, big Lenny.

05:13.625 --> 05:14.667
You gonna finish that?

05:15.333 --> 05:16.166
Cool.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.792
So what do you think, kid?

05:19.333 --> 05:21.041
Who's the master chicken thief?

05:21.125 --> 05:22.375
Gut instinct?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.250
I gotta go with Justin.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.041
Three from five...

05:26.750 --> 05:29.250
Or was it five from three?

05:29.709 --> 05:32.208
Think, Justin. Think.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.917
Or Val. Could be Val.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.375
So once the snake takes the meat,

05:46.125 --> 05:48.417
then I slip that over his neck.

05:48.792 --> 05:51.500
And then once I got him,
I turn to your camera and I say,

05:52.542 --> 05:54.000
"Take a break, snake!"

05:57.500 --> 06:00.458
Dad, I wouldn't overthink
the once-I've-got-him part.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.208
You know what? I still need a catchphrase.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.667
Something Tom Cruise can say
when he plays me in the movie.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.625
How about, "Boy, have I been miscast"?

06:13.125 --> 06:15.041
Uh, Gabe, I don't believe

06:15.125 --> 06:19.041
you've met Denver's least-favorite
animal-control officer.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.291
Bob: Hello, Quint.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.000
What are you doing here, bug boy?

06:22.083 --> 06:25.000
There's a monster snake
on the loose, not a termite.

06:25.917 --> 06:26.750
Yeah.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.500
Shouldn't you be getting
some old lady's kitty out of a tree?

06:29.583 --> 06:30.500
Hmm?

06:31.083 --> 06:32.208
Muffin can wait.

06:33.166 --> 06:37.166
First, I'm bringing in
that cold-blooded beast out there.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.083
Have you ever caught
anything like this before?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.583
Does this answer your question?

06:42.917 --> 06:43.917
That's a t-shirt.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.542
I'm here to catch a snake, not a cold.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.417
See that scar?

06:51.542 --> 06:53.625
I got that tangling with a great white.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.583
- Shark?
- Labradoodle.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.166
Those things are fierce.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.250
Face it, Duncan,
you're out of your league.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.792
You're an exterminator!

07:05.875 --> 07:08.000
What are you gonna do, tent the lake?

07:08.834 --> 07:10.041
Uh, no.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.834
I'm gonna catch him with this.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.709
Well, I'm gonna catch him with these...

07:15.500 --> 07:16.917
my nine assistants.

07:17.583 --> 07:18.500
Whoa.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.375
Labradoodle got my pinkie.

07:20.875 --> 07:21.750
Hmm.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.917
Hi, Mrs. Duncan.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.709
Hi, Spencer. Come on in.

07:33.792 --> 07:34.625
Thanks.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.959
So what you kids got planned for tonight?

07:40.667 --> 07:42.959
Um, what did Teddy say we were up to?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.208
She didn't.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.166
Answer the question.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.542
Uh...

07:49.625 --> 07:51.667
- Here I am!
- Spencer: Teddy.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.875
Hi. Your mom wants to know
what we're doing tonight.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.041
We're going to the movies.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.000
Oh. Which one?

07:58.083 --> 07:59.959
- Table For Two.
- What's it about?

08:00.041 --> 08:01.625
A table for two.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.125
- Rating?
- PG.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.625
- Running time?
- Ninety-eight minutes.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.417
- You seem to have all the answers.
- You seem to have all the questions.

08:12.750 --> 08:13.834
Let's go, Spencer.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.917
Sounds like you two
have a very specific evening planned.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Yes, we do.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.709
Have a nice night, Mrs. Duncan.

08:25.917 --> 08:26.792
I will.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.041
Table for three.

08:42.709 --> 08:43.625
Oh!

08:45.291 --> 08:47.250
Do not be alarmed. I am not an intruder.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.458
PJ, what are you doing?

08:50.542 --> 08:51.834
I'm going undercover to figure out

08:51.917 --> 08:53.750
which one of my co-workers
is stealing chicken.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.291
And you think they're gonna open up
when they see Gandalf?

08:58.834 --> 08:59.959
You got a better idea?

09:00.041 --> 09:01.917
Yeah, wear a wire.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.291
Yes! I love it.

09:04.917 --> 09:05.917
What's a wire?

09:06.917 --> 09:08.208
A recording device.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.917
You wear it under your clothes

09:10.000 --> 09:12.125
and then you can use
what the people say against them.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.417
Cool.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.834
- I'll wear a wire.
- Yeah.

09:14.917 --> 09:15.959
I'll be like a spy.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.250
A spy from middle earth.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.208
And I'll be like your brother...

09:22.750 --> 09:23.959
from planet Earth.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.709
Oh, movie my butt.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.375
Party time's over.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.542
You're doing a show...

09:55.250 --> 09:56.583
Without me?

10:07.250 --> 10:09.250
So this is what you've been doing?

10:09.750 --> 10:12.083
Rehearsing a musical behind my back?

10:12.583 --> 10:15.542
Teddy, when did you stop loving me?

10:16.375 --> 10:18.542
Mom, I was hoping
you wouldn't find out this way.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.208
Actually, I was just hoping
you wouldn't find out.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.834
And you're doing Franny Saves the Farm ?

10:26.917 --> 10:29.250
That's my favorite musical of all time.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.166
Not only that, she's playing Franny.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.709
Don't help me, Franklin.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.333
Hey, let's, uh,
let's take a five, everybody.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.959
Oh, Teddy, why would you
keep this from me?

10:45.041 --> 10:48.125
I could have helped you,
taught you, mentored you.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.917
Yeah, and those are
three of the reasons I didn't tell you.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.834
What are you trying to say?

10:53.917 --> 10:57.333
Mom, anytime I try to do something
that has to do with performing,

10:57.417 --> 10:58.583
you get involved.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.959
And you don't just get involved,
you take over.

11:01.041 --> 11:03.583
Well, I'm sorry, Teddy.

11:03.709 --> 11:05.542
Okay? I love the spotlight.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.709
But in fairness,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.083
not as much as the spotlight loves me.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.375
Mom, I would like for you
to not make this about you,

11:15.458 --> 11:16.417
just this one time.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.667
Please, could you just be my mom?

11:19.125 --> 11:20.750
Moms bring flowers,

11:20.834 --> 11:22.959
they sit in the audience
and they watch their kids.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.250
- Well, I--
- Quietly.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.417
Well...

11:27.834 --> 11:30.083
I'm sorry I've been
such a terrible mother.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.417
No, mom, I didn't...

11:36.834 --> 11:38.375
I told you
the spotlight loved me.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.000
Clark, cut it out.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.875
Reporter: ...for 14 miles per hour...

11:51.959 --> 11:54.417
Well, time to get some sleep, Gabe.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.792
Got a snake to catch tomorrow.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
Hey, dad,

11:58.458 --> 12:00.750
have you ever knocked out
a grizzly bear with one punch?

12:01.959 --> 12:03.875
Well, let me think.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.041
Uh, no.

12:07.709 --> 12:08.834
You know who has?

12:09.375 --> 12:10.208
Quint.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.959
Well, how do you know that?

12:13.041 --> 12:15.875
I'm reading this blog.
It's called "Quint While You're Ahead."

12:18.208 --> 12:19.500
Man, is he tough!

12:19.583 --> 12:21.208
Hey, I'm just as tough as quint.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.375
I don't know, dad.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.667
Maybe you should leave
the snake catching to him.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.375
I mean, you're an exterminator.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.333
You set off bug bombs and run.

12:33.542 --> 12:36.500
I have to run, Gabe.
It's government mandated.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.166
Time to catch a chicken thief.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.000
So glad you all could come over,

12:54.083 --> 12:56.583
Justin, Val and Big Lenny.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.166
And we're away from work,

13:00.625 --> 13:02.542
so we can really let our hair down.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.667
I let my hair down at work all the time.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.625
I lost a scrunchie in the coleslaw once.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.375
Come on, guys, this is our chance to bond,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.083
share our hopes, our dreams,

13:14.792 --> 13:15.959
our darkest secrets.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.458
Who wants to go first?

13:19.583 --> 13:20.417
Lenny?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.333
I'm hungry.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.000
Good start.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.583
Not a secret, but good start.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.917
If we're telling secrets,
why don't you go first?

13:30.667 --> 13:31.625
Okay.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.083
Okay.

13:33.166 --> 13:35.500
Uh, sometimes...

13:36.083 --> 13:37.750
I steal supplies from work.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.041
Anybody want to piggyback on that?

13:41.959 --> 13:44.208
- I took a straw once.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.583
But I felt so bad, I brought back two.

13:49.667 --> 13:50.500
Hmm.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.834
What was that?

13:53.875 --> 13:56.208
- What was what?
- Sounded like feedback.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.333
I didn't hear anything.

14:06.709 --> 14:08.208
Mom, what are you doing here?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.834
Well, it is children's theater.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.542
I thought Charlie might like it.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.917
And she has something for you.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.750
Aw, Charlie, thank you.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.000
Okay, come on, sweetie, let's go.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.166
Oh, mom, wait. Um...

14:25.750 --> 14:27.542
About what I said yesterday,

14:27.625 --> 14:29.041
I was out of line.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.583
And?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.417
And I'm really sorry.

14:34.792 --> 14:35.750
And?

14:38.667 --> 14:39.750
That's all I got.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.083
Okay.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.500
Well, you may not
have been entirely wrong.

14:47.041 --> 14:52.041
It might be possible
that I have a small problem

14:52.125 --> 14:53.709
with the spotlight.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.333
Mom, we're backstage.
The lights are out front.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.834
That's what I hate about backstage.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.125
Anyway, this is your moment to shine.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.458
So as we say in the theater,

15:10.041 --> 15:11.709
- break a leg.
- Teddy: Oh.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.417
Terrible news,
Franklin just broke his leg.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.750
- He can't do the show.
- Well, what are we going to do?

15:20.834 --> 15:22.583
I've got to find somebody
to play banker Jones,

15:22.667 --> 15:24.083
somebody who knows the part.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.458
Okay, I swear
I had nothing to do with this.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.917
Yeah, good day to catch a snake.

15:43.834 --> 15:44.875
You're right!

15:44.959 --> 15:48.458
It was. I caught him an hour ago,
took him to the zoo.

15:48.542 --> 15:49.500
You did?

15:52.041 --> 15:53.458
Well, then what are you doing here?

15:53.542 --> 15:54.959
Came back to do this.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.875
Aw, man, was that Quint?

16:03.959 --> 16:06.166
Great. So I missed
the coolest guy in the world

16:06.250 --> 16:07.834
because I had to get your potato chips.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.417
Hey, the point is, did you get 'em?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.250
So did Quint see the snake?

16:16.333 --> 16:18.041
Yeah, matter of fact, he did.

16:18.125 --> 16:18.959
And then he--

16:22.458 --> 16:23.583
and then he left...

16:25.458 --> 16:26.709
Because he was afraid.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.542
- Quint's afraid?
- Yeah.

16:28.625 --> 16:29.834
Can you believe that?

16:29.917 --> 16:32.250
Coolest guy in the world leaves
because he's afraid.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.500
But you know who isn't afraid?

16:34.041 --> 16:35.083
Your old man.

16:35.542 --> 16:39.125
And I am putting an end to this
once and for all.

16:39.875 --> 16:40.959
All right.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.291
Come and get it, snappy!

16:45.959 --> 16:47.875
Dad, are you sure about this?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.333
Bob: Hey, a man's got to do
what a man's got--

16:50.417 --> 16:52.875
Oh, man! This water is cold.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.542
What's he doing out there?

16:57.041 --> 16:59.083
- Catching the snake.
- What?

16:59.417 --> 17:02.166
- Duncan, I was lying!
- Bob: What?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.959
I didn't catch the snake!

17:04.041 --> 17:06.208
Bob: Yes, I am in the lake!

17:06.375 --> 17:07.583
Dad, come back.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.125
I was just trying to get rid of you.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.875
- Bob: What?
- Whoa.

17:11.667 --> 17:13.458
Is that a log floating towards him or...

17:13.542 --> 17:15.542
Bob: Snake!

17:15.875 --> 17:17.875
Snake in the lake!

17:18.625 --> 17:22.166
Get in the truck! Get in the truck!
Get in the truck!

17:24.041 --> 17:25.750
Like father, like son.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.417
A couple of scaredy cats
running from a stupid log.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.083
Uh-oh.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.542
So that's it? You learned nothing?

17:41.208 --> 17:43.542
I learned big Lenny combs his beard
with a fork.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.166
So we'll never find out
who's stealing the chicken.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.250
Corporate is gonna be devastated.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.333
This is gonna haunt me forever.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.208
- Oh, well!
- You know, funny thing though.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.417
After the party, I came back here
to look at our security-camera footage.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.542
We, uh, have security cameras?

18:01.625 --> 18:02.625
Yeah.

18:02.709 --> 18:06.458
Yeah, and it showed this guy
who looks just like you

18:06.542 --> 18:08.625
taking boxes of chicken
out of the storage fridge.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.667
Do you, by chance,
have an evil twin brother?

18:13.542 --> 18:15.917
I don't recall.

18:17.041 --> 18:20.333
Then your brother
put the stolen chicken in his car.

18:20.417 --> 18:21.875
- You got that on tape?
- Uh-huh.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.834
And here's the crazy part.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.667
Your brother drives
the exact same car that you do.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.959
I guess that makes sense though.
I mean, you are twins.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.000
All right!

18:32.166 --> 18:33.792
Quit toying with me. I confess.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.208
I stole the chicken...

18:35.792 --> 18:37.583
so I could open my own place.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.792
Mitch's Discount Poultry Hut.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.125
Wait. So you don't have a twin brother?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.250
Stop it, kid. You got me, all right?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.250
Okay. Well, I'm confused.
If you were the one stealing the chicken,

18:51.709 --> 18:53.250
why did you ask me
to catch a chicken thief?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.000
I mean, I'm your best man, right?

18:55.083 --> 18:57.500
I never thought someone
so stupid could catch me.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.250
Well, look who's stupid now.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.834
'Cause I just caught you
and your twin brother.

Well, Charlie, you were a little chicken.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.417
And, uh, apparently, so was dad.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
Hey, hey! I was not chicken.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.166
I was exiting the lake in a rapid fashion.

20:32.291 --> 20:33.709
No, dad, it's all right.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.709
I'd rather have a live coward
than a dead hero.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.250
Oh, thank you, son.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.250
Yeah. Live hero would have
been the best, but...

20:43.333 --> 20:44.375
Bob: Of course.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.375
I mean, if you're going to rank them,
you'd want your live hero, live coward.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.417
Yeah. You know, dead hero, dead coward.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.750
Yeah, dead coward. Those guys are losers.

20:53.959 --> 20:55.333
Teddy: Hey, uh, do you guys mind?

20:55.375 --> 20:57.000
I'm trying to do a video diary here.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.834
Just say "Good luck, Charlie" and be done.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.875
Look, it's not that easy. It's...

21:05.208 --> 21:06.375
Good luck, Charlie.

21:22.709 --> 21:23.625
Huh.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.375
Down here.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.583
Oh, hey, it's you.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.208
Hello, Snappy.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.375
PJ.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.500
Long time, amigo.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.583
Yeah, you, uh, you look well.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.750
Save it!

21:48.625 --> 21:50.500
How could you do this to me?

21:51.166 --> 21:54.166
"Snappy, why don't you hop in the lake

21:54.291 --> 21:57.000
while I get us some ice cream"?

21:58.834 --> 22:01.000
Well, I got ice cream.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.250
But you never came back.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.917
You never came...

22:07.500 --> 22:12.083
Oh, yummy, yummy.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.709
Who is this?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.000
This is Charlie,
and don't even think about it.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.375
Not even a nibble?

22:18.875 --> 22:20.208
Thanks for stopping by, Snappy.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.542
Who is it?

22:26.125 --> 22:28.417
Toy delivery for Charlie.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.625
Go away!
