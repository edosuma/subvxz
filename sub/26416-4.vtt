WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.872
Previously on Z Nation.

00:02.915 --> 00:05.962
Today was to have been a day
of joy, unity, and progress.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.355
George?!

00:08.486 --> 00:10.184
Not a day of death, fear,
and pain.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.882
Altura authorities are asking
Joseph Dante

00:12.925 --> 00:15.232
to turn himself in
for questioning.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.497
I am calling for the quarantine
of all Talkers.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.546
We've had to make difficult
choices before.

00:24.589 --> 00:25.764
That's how we survived.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.115
Sarge! No!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.216
Clara Moore.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.742
Michael Towsack.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.180
After all the suffering
we have endured,

00:50.224 --> 00:55.316
it is the strength of the human
soul that will carry us through.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.885
Joining those who have gone
before and will come after,

00:59.929 --> 01:02.758
these names and DNA,

01:02.801 --> 01:05.630
sealed in glass here
for millennia to come,

01:05.674 --> 01:08.764
are a memorial to who we were.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.984
So if we are the last generation
of humans,

01:12.028 --> 01:13.986
we are not lost to the universe,

01:14.030 --> 01:17.077
as we place another brick
in the wall.

01:17.120 --> 01:22.169
We must renew our efforts to
protect what we have built here.

01:22.212 --> 01:26.608
Sergeant Madison Lilly. USMC.

01:26.651 --> 01:27.261
Nothing less

01:27.304 --> 01:28.566
Will you do it?

01:28.610 --> 01:31.439
than the future of humanity
is at stake.

01:32.657 --> 01:39.316
For as long as we live, they too
will live, as we remember them.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.115
Dante would have
gone to Pacifica.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.639
They know him there.
And if he was hurt, injured,

01:57.682 --> 02:00.250
in trouble,
anybody would help him.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.644
We're his family.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.602
People around here consider him
a hero.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.213
I believe you.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.391
But the longer he stays on the
run, the more guilty he seems.

02:10.434 --> 02:13.089
And vigilantes don't care
if he's innocent.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.830
We'll find him.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.441
He's probably waiting for us.
We're almost there.

02:17.485 --> 02:21.141
I can't wait for you to see
Pacifica. It's pretty great.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.186
Largest collection of
books in the New World.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.755
Wow. Books. I can't remember
the last one I read.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.800
So what's the population?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.150
65 adults.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.457
Six kids. It used to be just
twenty of us students.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.286
Everybody gets along. Mostly.

02:36.939 --> 02:41.378
Yeah. It's not perfect yet, but
we're trying to make it work.

02:41.422 --> 02:44.947
I mean everybody's equal.
Black, white, gay, straight,

02:44.990 --> 02:46.905
Talkers and humans.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.211
Nice.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.212
Who woulda thunk it?

02:50.431 --> 02:52.650
The Zompocalypse,
nature's great equalizer.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.045
Well, it's not the promised land
yet.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.395
What do you see, chief?

03:00.136 --> 03:01.572
People running. There.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.443
I see them!

03:03.270 --> 03:04.358
I think I know them.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.620
Talkers?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.622
Yeah. Running from something.

03:07.665 --> 03:11.191
Or someone. All right,
Doc, CZ, stay with the truck.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.376
Looks like a lot of foot traffic
up in through here.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.552
Talkers are probably
trying to stay off the road.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.335
Shit.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.382
It's a Talker.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.341
You can tell by the bizkit bag.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.821
It's not from around here.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.605
It's been dead a while.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.085
Something ate its brains.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.391
That unusual?

03:37.434 --> 03:39.610
Around here it is.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.221
At least until recently.

03:42.657 --> 03:46.138
Hold it right there.
Put your hands in the air.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.927
Henry?

03:52.536 --> 03:53.972
Oh, thank god.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.410
We didn't know
if you were alive.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.760
We saw the attack on
CZ's livestream. Is he...

03:58.803 --> 03:59.674
He's here.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.241
Back in our truck.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.982
Oh, Kaya will be out of her
mind. She's been so worried.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.507
Henry,

04:07.769 --> 04:10.206
this is Lieutenant
Roberta Warren.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.338
Remember, she's
the one that saved me?

04:11.381 --> 04:12.034
What? No way.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.383
Back in Black Summer.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.254
Lieutenant Warren, meet
professor Henry McCabe

04:15.820 --> 04:19.259
Of course I remember you.
Congratulations. You made it.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.696
Pleasure to meet you,
Professor. Again.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.307
Thanks for saving George.

04:24.351 --> 04:27.441
In a way, you saved all of us.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.706
I don't remember the last time
I saw you with a gun.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.491
I know. I thought this
was behind me.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.885
We doubled our patrols
since the attack.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.409
We've been hearing rumors about
attacks on other outposts.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.193
I'm just so relieved
you're back.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.630
Have you heard from Dante?

04:42.673 --> 04:45.415
Nothing. We heard he was
a suspect. That's insane.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.373
I know.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.114
I need to get to him
before the militia does.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.986
Well they think the Talkers
are plotting against the humans.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.553
The Talkers aren't the enemy.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.989
They're human too.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.034
Pacifica is a living testament
to that. You'll see.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.645
We live in peace and harmony.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.648
It's not always easy,
but we make it work.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.694
Or at least we did
up until last week.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.537
Let's move.

05:26.587 --> 05:31.679
[electric guitar theme music
plays]

05:31.722 --> 05:33.768
♪ Have mercy...

05:35.726 --> 05:40.514
♪ Oh, have mercy. ♪

05:45.127 --> 05:46.911
Wow, look at this.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.218
Just what I always thought
college would look like.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.873
Yeah. Kaya and I checked out
all the outposts

05:51.916 --> 05:53.483
before we chose Pacifica.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.659
We really wanted JZ
to go to school.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.140
So basically we took
the south end of campus

05:58.183 --> 05:59.663
with the library
and the dining hall

05:59.707 --> 06:01.273
and made it zombie proof.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.405
Dining hall?

06:02.449 --> 06:04.451
Oh, we have an incredible chef.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.410
Hold up. You have a chef?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
That implies you have food.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.588
Chef Amy. She's an amazing chef.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.461
But because she's a Talker, she
can't eat anything she cooks.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.332
Kinda like Beethoven being deaf.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.730
Chef likes to keep a few humans
around as tasters.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.384
Might be an opening for you,
Doc.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.212
Great. I can finally
put the munchies to good use.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.475
Where do I sign?

06:28.518 --> 06:30.520
Here's the dining hall. Come on.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.043
I'll introduce you to Chef.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.045
Should be busy
with the dinner hour.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.881
Think the maitre d' can seat us?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.231
This place is usually packed.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.409
So, should we be worried?

06:49.844 --> 06:50.932
Hey, Phil?

06:51.193 --> 06:52.586
Where is everybody?

06:55.110 --> 06:58.026
Not much of a conversationalist,
is he?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.724
It's odd. Looks like dinner
was interrupted.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.639
I wonder what's going on.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.729
Uh, let's take them
to the library.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.035
Kaya and JZ will be
there.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.994
I can't wait to see
Kaya in the Sky-a.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.563
The library is really what sold
Kaya and me on Pacifica.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.173
As far as we know,

07:15.217 --> 07:17.785
it's the largest collection of
books still under human control.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.830
Some day we're hoping to
send expeditions out

07:19.874 --> 07:21.876
to rescue books
from the great libraries.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.878
I used to love me
some Steven King.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.575
But after eight years
of Apocalypse,

07:25.619 --> 07:27.925
it seems a little tame.

07:28.796 --> 07:33.453
This is the Pacifica
pièce de résistance.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.932
Wow, what is that?

07:34.976 --> 07:37.326
It's the Pacifica Family Tree.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.068
A communal record
of all the citizens of Pacifica

07:40.111 --> 07:43.506
and every ancestor
they can remember.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.377
There are so few survivors left,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.858
we want to memorialize
as many as we can.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.295
What do the colors stand for?

07:50.731 --> 07:52.559
The yellow are humans.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.169
The green are Talkers.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.345
Brown died before
the apocalypse.

07:56.388 --> 07:59.261
And the black, those turned Z.

07:59.870 --> 08:03.744
Kinda gets to you, seeing it
all laid out like that.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.484
And that...

08:05.049 --> 08:06.268
That's Kaya's Nana.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.312
Hey, Nana!

08:07.878 --> 08:09.880
I missed you too.

08:10.402 --> 08:10.968
Hey.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.231
Let's go meet my family.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.930
I'm gonna go see
where everybody is.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.064
Hey Nana?

08:20.108 --> 08:23.067
I got a little something
for your pipe for later.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.164
There's my boy! Hey!

08:34.078 --> 08:34.557
Daddy!

08:37.212 --> 08:39.693
I'm gonna eat you
like a monster!

08:43.305 --> 08:44.741
Kaya?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.309
You're alive.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.051
I tried to call.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.663
Oh baby, I'm so glad
you're alive.

08:53.707 --> 08:57.362
Ewww!

08:57.406 --> 08:59.756
Good to know some things
never change.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.934
Kaya, meet Lieutenant Warren.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.285
Well, hello Lieutenant Warren.

09:07.329 --> 09:10.724
Oh come on, we can do
better than that. Come here.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.033
So nice to finally meet you,
Kaya.

09:16.077 --> 09:16.773
Yeah.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.819
And this, this is Doc.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.430
Hey, Kaya.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.129
Okay now, who is this
little person?

09:25.173 --> 09:28.132
Hey JZ, meet my buddies.
This is Warren.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.438
Hi, little man.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.745
And this is Doc.

09:31.788 --> 09:32.572
Pound it.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.138
Boom!

09:36.097 --> 09:39.491
Oh wow, I see you've got
a little friend. Who's that?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.108
Yeah, well hello butterfly.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.413
What's your name?

09:48.457 --> 09:49.806
Emery.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.069
Oh, nice to meet you, Emery.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.158
Emery's a Talker.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.596
Can I get a hug?

09:59.990 --> 10:00.687
George?

10:01.992 --> 10:03.298
You gotta come.
They called a town hall meeting.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.082
But no Talkers allowed.

10:05.126 --> 10:08.390
Chef and the Talkers are scared.
It's... madness.

10:15.092 --> 10:18.008
Pacifica is all of us.

10:18.052 --> 10:21.882
Humans, Talkers, that is
the entire point of this place.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.972
Danny! What you're talking about
is utopia, man.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.539
Look around. This is real life!

10:27.583 --> 10:30.412
These are not strangers
or freaks.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.848
That's exactly what they are!

10:31.892 --> 10:35.678
That's my aunt out there,
and she feeds all of you!

10:35.722 --> 10:38.115
The things that happened in
Altura was a Talker uprising!

10:38.159 --> 10:39.987
That's not true!
That's ridiculous!

10:40.030 --> 10:42.816
I am sick of all this
political correctness.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.775
You are acting like this is not
a real threat to our survival.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.865
You're the threat
to their survival.

10:50.171 --> 10:50.693
Guys?

10:51.738 --> 10:52.564
George is here.

10:52.608 --> 10:53.304
George?

10:53.348 --> 10:54.044
What's going on?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.524
George, this is madness.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.135
They've locked us out
of a town hall meeting.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.702
They said it's for humans only.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.445
Danny's in there trying to
convince them to let us in.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.839
Danny's her nephew. Human.

11:06.535 --> 11:10.017
This is freaking scary.
Why would they shut us out?

11:10.495 --> 11:13.020
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.078
How bout that?

11:28.339 --> 11:29.601
Nothing.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.694
Now?

11:34.737 --> 11:36.696
Yes, I think I feel something.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.699
My right foot.
It's like it's there.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.879
Please mercy me.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.490
I cannot live
without my wife and kids.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.448
I'm sorry, Mike.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.408
But I can't do that.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.846
You've given me so much already.
But

11:56.890 --> 12:00.328
I need to know
what keeps you talking.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.816
We're done for now.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.298
Mike?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.476
I am so sorry to hear what
happened to you and your family.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.173
Here, Mike.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.392
Take these.
They're rationing them.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.785
I don't want it.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.874
I don't want anything
to make this last longer.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.665
How's he doing?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.147
His wife and son
got killed in the blast.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.497
And he was left like that.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.413
We didn't evolve to handle that.

12:42.718 --> 12:46.374
It's no way to exist.
It's worse than being a zombie.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.855
At least Zs
don't know they're Zs.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.001
How you doing, 10K?

13:05.045 --> 13:06.481
How soon can we get out of here?

13:06.524 --> 13:08.483
You need to take time
to recover.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.311
You don't want an infection.

13:10.354 --> 13:13.793
The longer we stay here, the
harder it's gonna be to get out.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
Let me take a look at your arm.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.101
See how that cauterization
is doing.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.027
It's healing beautifully.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.769
It's not.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.860
This is my hand, right?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.732
Yeah. Red went back
and found it.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.560
I want you to sew it back on.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.084
It doesn't work
like that.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.868
Well what am I supposed to do
with this?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.261
Tommy...

13:48.915 --> 13:51.265
It sucks, I know. But you can
learn to live without a hand.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.571
There are prosthetic options.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.618
We'll get through this.

13:59.490 --> 14:00.665
Roman?

14:00.709 --> 14:01.536
Doctor.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.713
I see you're busy, so I
won't take much of your time.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.934
I just wanted to make sure you
had everything you needed

14:07.977 --> 14:10.806
to complete your research. It's
more important now than ever.

14:12.068 --> 14:15.898
I heard you lost a hand.
I'm very soon.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.945
Oh it's okay. They found it.
It's right here.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.774
When things settle down,
come see me about that hand.

14:22.818 --> 14:26.387
We're doing great things with
robotics. I can help you.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.867
I've got some meetings to attend

14:27.910 --> 14:29.346
with some of the other
outpost leaders

14:29.390 --> 14:31.044
to discuss where we go
from here.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.308
You can update me
in detail then.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.581
I didn't come this far
to be eaten alive

14:46.624 --> 14:48.713
so that you can feel better
about yourselves.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.325
Can I say something?!

14:51.891 --> 14:53.370
This is not like us.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.242
Or it's just like us.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.635
George, the people have gone
crazy.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.551
They are talking about putting
the Talkers in a quarantine.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.640
Just until we know
what's going on.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.555
Well that's a slippery slope,
brother.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.643
They are dangerous.

15:06.862 --> 15:07.994
You have no right
to put my family at risk.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.561
Okay, take it easy.
Let's back it up a bit.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.129
Beth, nobody wants
to put your family at risk.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.696
I am not like you.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.525
I don't believe that everything
is gonna be okay.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.702
I'm not gonna sit around and
wait for something bad to happen

15:20.745 --> 15:21.529
Beth.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.794
George, you have to
do something.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.275
I dunno what to...

15:30.538 --> 15:32.453
Jeez, Beth!

15:35.369 --> 15:36.936
Jesus Christ.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.765
Simon says hop on one foot.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.855
Wow, you guys are good.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.815
Simon says stop.
Simon says pat your head.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.252
Logan, get over here.

15:49.296 --> 15:49.861
Mom!

15:50.862 --> 15:51.559
You're not playing
with Talkers.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.430
Hey! They're just kids.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.867
That Talker kid
can kill my child.

15:55.911 --> 15:56.781
Hey!

15:58.087 --> 15:59.567
Way to hurt her feelings.
She's still a kid!

15:59.610 --> 16:01.177
You just don't get it.

16:09.316 --> 16:12.188
Can we please cut the bullshit?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.451
They are not human.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.627
Yeah, well you're not
showing a whole lot of humanity

16:16.671 --> 16:17.715
yourself there, pal.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.848
My wife isn't gonna hurt anyone.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.285
As long as she gets her bizkits,
she's fine.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.722
What do we do if we run out
of bizkits?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.159
No delivery came this week.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.857
That's why we need to
put them in quarantine, George.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.380
If you are so hell bent
on protecting them,

16:30.424 --> 16:31.773
you will put them in quarantine.

16:31.816 --> 16:32.948
And then we'll all be safe.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.558
Please.
Tell me we're not honestly

16:34.602 --> 16:37.953
talking about putting our family
and friends into a camp.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.390
This is not Nazi Germany.
This is Pacifica.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.915
There have been more Zs
this week than all of this year.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.961
What do you all think
is attracting them?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.702
Talkers are going feral!

16:47.745 --> 16:50.400
Wait a god damn minute!
Who are you calling feral?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.011
Aunt Amy,
don't make this personal.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.665
I've had enough.
I say quarantine!

16:54.709 --> 16:56.406
Quarantine!
Quarantine! Quarantine!

16:56.450 --> 16:59.061
Nobody's separating me
and my wife!

16:59.105 --> 16:59.888
Quarantine!

16:59.931 --> 17:01.498
Then you can go with her!

17:01.542 --> 17:02.108
Shit!

17:02.630 --> 17:03.631
You son of a bitch!

17:13.119 --> 17:15.034
Now that I have
your attention...

17:15.599 --> 17:16.426
Please,

17:16.861 --> 17:18.341
sit down.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.388
I'm new around here.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.390
So...

17:24.260 --> 17:27.089
Please forgive me if I overstep.

17:29.004 --> 17:32.486
You say you want
to form a new country.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.097
What kind of country
would that be?

17:35.445 --> 17:37.665
You talk of quarantine.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.494
That only comes
from a place of fear.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.974
You got vigilantes out there
that are

17:43.018 --> 17:49.068
sending messages of hate
that is rooted in the same fear.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.984
We just came from finding
a Talker

17:53.028 --> 17:54.986
that was left to rot alive.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.119
We have every right
to be afraid.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.555
The zombie virus

17:58.599 --> 18:00.992
is not the only virus you need
to be worried about.

18:01.645 --> 18:06.259
Acts of hate rooted in fear
is a virus too.

18:07.695 --> 18:12.482
And it will eat your brains
faster than any Talker.

18:13.831 --> 18:19.924
How can you dehumanize
your neighbor, your friend,

18:20.664 --> 18:23.363
oh god, your family?

18:23.928 --> 18:27.062
How is it
that we see them as a threat?

18:27.671 --> 18:32.763
Come on, is that...a country
you want to live in?

18:34.809 --> 18:39.118
Cuz that is not a country
I'm willing to die for.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.080
Thank you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.603
You bet.

18:48.736 --> 18:49.998
Everyone.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.613
I want us all to take a moment
to look around the room.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.139
Remember who we are
to each other.

19:00.487 --> 19:04.665
Each of us is here today because
of the others in this room.

19:04.969 --> 19:08.451
Each of us has saved one
another. Multiple times.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.846
We are only alive
because of each other.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.414
And that includes
our Talker family and friends.

19:14.457 --> 19:18.592
They aren't our friends.
Not anymore. They're dead.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.117
They might be dead,
but they're still here.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.206
Their hearts might not
be beating,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.817
but their soul
is still in there.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.646
Who knew death would one day
be on a sliding scale,

19:29.690 --> 19:31.605
but that's the world
we find ourselves in.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.781
They still want to eat
our brains.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.957
Not everyone's. Just yours.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.089
Look,

19:39.439 --> 19:40.657
as long as they get
their bizkits, the Talkers

19:40.701 --> 19:42.137
are no more dangerous
than your average human.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.096
Probably less dangerous
by the looks of this bunch.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.969
I know we're all shaken
by the latest attacks on Altura.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.231
There were several dozen Zs

19:49.275 --> 19:52.974
that seemed to be part
of a coordinated attack.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.543
And we can't rule out that
Talkers were somehow involved.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.110
Is that why Altura soldiers
are looking for Dante?

19:59.154 --> 20:01.722
You know Dante would never
be part of something like that.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.464
I don't know that.
And neither do you.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.509
I know that if it weren't
for Dante,

20:06.553 --> 20:08.424
I wouldn't be standing here
alive.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.861
None of us would.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.385
We would all be dead.

20:12.428 --> 20:15.605
We just can't trust any of them.
Dante included.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.703
They don't trust you either,
brother.

20:27.574 --> 20:33.362
Listen. You guys have a chance
at building a new world.

20:34.494 --> 20:38.976
Please do not build it on fear.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
I still have hope.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.420
And I know you do too.

20:47.811 --> 20:52.033
That one day this one long dark
howl of despair will be over.

20:52.599 --> 20:56.167
Guys, there will be
an after someday.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.257
And when that day comes,

20:59.954 --> 21:03.044
I want to be able to live
with myself.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.134
What do you want us to do?

21:06.743 --> 21:09.180
Go home. Get some rest.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.532
Remember what we've dreamed of
here.

21:12.575 --> 21:16.536
The cold reality is one day
we will all be Talkers.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.974
I hope this looks different
tomorrow.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.106
In the morning, we'll continue
our search for Dante.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.326
If he's in the wind,
it's for a reason.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.763
Maybe it's because he's guilty.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.809
If that's the case,

21:28.852 --> 21:31.855
I'll be the first one
to bring him to justice.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.177
Doc and I will take watch.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.092
No, you guys have to sleep.

21:51.135 --> 21:55.792
Your Pacifican humans didn't
seem so pacifico tonight.

21:55.836 --> 22:00.928
I'm sorry. They're all
good people. Just scared.

22:01.581 --> 22:05.062
We'll be fine.
I'm not taking any chances.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.027
Looks like these books

22:13.070 --> 22:15.072
are gonna get a better nights
sleep than you.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.772
I can't sleep on a bed.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.907
Eight years sleeping on the
ground, I sleep better here.

22:23.951 --> 22:24.952
That's sad.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.913
You did a great job tonight
calming people down.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.742
I see why they put their trust
in you.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.049
For how long?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.965
I did my best.
It all went to shit.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.446
I'm tired, you know?

22:42.665 --> 22:45.668
I think it's time
for somebody else to try.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.148
There's nobody else.

22:47.191 --> 22:50.194
I just don't think I can be
who they want me to be.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.195
Yes, you can.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.110
Because you have to.

22:53.676 --> 22:56.636
Because you know,
the way that I do,

22:57.158 --> 22:59.856
there is nobody else but us.

23:00.248 --> 23:04.078
We don't get to have doubts
because when we do, we hesitate,

23:04.121 --> 23:06.428
and that's when people die.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
George?

23:17.221 --> 23:20.703
I will back you
a hundred percent.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.619
But I got to ask.

23:23.663 --> 23:28.537
Is there any part of you
that suspects Dante?

23:28.581 --> 23:31.627
Dante's like a brother to me.
Okay? It's like...

23:32.498 --> 23:33.977
Doc betraying you.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.939
You know,

23:39.505 --> 23:42.333
there are few things
I've learned to depend on

23:42.377 --> 23:43.552
in this apocalypse.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.686
And Stephen Beck
is one of the few.

23:47.382 --> 23:50.472
Did you know
that was his real name?

24:12.189 --> 24:14.757
Deux, trois, tres.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.324
Spanish.

24:16.367 --> 24:24.593
Uno, dos, tres,
cuatro, cinco, seis, siete.

25:54.770 --> 25:55.423
Chief?

25:55.466 --> 25:56.467
Yeah.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.780
Intruders?

26:04.824 --> 26:05.694
Escapees.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.132
I can't find any Talkers!

26:09.176 --> 26:09.916
All of them?

26:09.959 --> 26:10.786
Yeah.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.094
What's going on?!

26:14.921 --> 26:17.924
The Talkers are gone!
They're all gone!

26:17.967 --> 26:18.751
Really?

26:18.794 --> 26:19.621
Good riddance.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.579
Everyone?!

26:20.622 --> 26:21.928
Everyone!

26:32.634 --> 26:33.592
Thank you.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.072
They can't have gotten far.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.683
Probably hunkered down
till daylight.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.859
I feel terrible. They're
probably scared to death.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.948
Can't say that I blame 'em.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.951
If we move quickly,
we can catch up with them.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.779
You need to just let them go.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.608
They don't belong here.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.698
Vigilantes are crucifying
Talkers out there.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.438
You just don't get it, do you?

26:54.482 --> 26:55.614
More than you know.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.180
Let's go.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.355
Please.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.574
Warren?!

27:00.967 --> 27:01.489
Hey.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.055
Hey.

27:02.925 --> 27:03.447
Kaya's got some intel for you.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.274
What you know?

27:05.885 --> 27:07.582
Not too much. But Chef told me
they were headed into the woods.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.106
Supposed to look for a symbol.
It's like

27:10.150 --> 27:12.805
half a sun
with three rays coming out.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.111
She left this behind.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.157
You talked to Chef?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.246
She told me to tell you
thank you

27:19.289 --> 27:22.945
for everything you were trying
to do but not to follow them.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.904
Why didn't you tell us something
sooner?

27:24.947 --> 27:26.949
I guess I was worried
about them.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.082
The things people were saying
scared me too.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.388
She's safer here than out there.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.698
I'm not so sure anymore.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.222
Amazing how quick things turn,
huh?

27:41.529 --> 27:44.053
Looks like somebody's
helping them out there.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.142
A Talker underground.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.057
Come on.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.691
Really?

28:12.908 --> 28:14.170
I know.

28:14.214 --> 28:18.000
I'm just trying to find
an interim solution

28:18.044 --> 28:20.568
until engineering can
manufacture you a better one.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.091
How long is that gonna take?

28:22.352 --> 28:24.964
It's hard to say
with the lockdown.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.009
There's a lot of wounded
to care for.

28:28.663 --> 28:31.971
Just give me something
that I can pull a trigger with.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.069
Somebody's in a damn hurry.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.505
Maybe it's a bizkit delivery.

28:44.548 --> 28:45.941
Those don't look like
bizkit trucks.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.856
Over here! Look at this.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.512
That's them all right.
It's a piece of Chef's scarf.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.035
Hold it right there!

28:53.079 --> 28:54.210
Put your hands
where I can see them!

28:54.254 --> 28:55.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.647
We're just looking
for our friends.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.779
Any Talkers with you?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.521
No, sir.
No one but us humans.

29:01.565 --> 29:05.395
Can I help you, Captain?
I work with Roman Estes.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.313
I know who you are.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.754
We're looking for your pal,
Dante.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.711
Have you seen him?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.277
No.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.409
I haven't. Not since the blast.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.846
And those charges are bullshit.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.021
That's not what I hear.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.979
What are they planning to do
with him?

29:24.023 --> 29:25.067
Put him on trial.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.677
Trial?

29:26.721 --> 29:29.724
What court system
That's what the vote was for.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.465
A provisional court
has been formed.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.641
Estes is chief justice.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.513
Dante will get a fair trial.

29:36.557 --> 29:37.819
Then we'll mercy him.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.517
If you help Dante
evade us in any way,

29:40.561 --> 29:42.868
we will arrest you too for being
an accessory to murder.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.739
Look, she's telling you
the truth.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.175
We don't know where he is.

29:46.219 --> 29:49.004
It's also now a crime to
help Talkers avoid quarantine.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.179
This is wrong.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.833
Maybe. Maybe not.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.749
But it's the law.
And we intend to enforce it.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.751
What law? There's no vote.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.534
Look.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.886
If you see Dante or any of
your other Talker friends,

30:00.929 --> 30:02.844
you need to report it
immediately.

30:02.888 --> 30:06.108
Or you will be subject
to arrest.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.417
Move out!

30:11.070 --> 30:12.549
Have a nice day.

30:17.424 --> 30:20.340
We need to find Dante
before they do.

31:16.787 --> 31:17.919
Sun Mei?

31:18.615 --> 31:21.488
Roman, you startled me.

31:21.531 --> 31:22.706
I see that.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.188
Why aren't you in the lab?

31:26.797 --> 31:28.756
I needed some time to think.

31:29.235 --> 31:33.065
The past three test cycles
have been complete failures.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.023
The side effects have been
horrible.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.982
I know this must be hard on you.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.898
But your work must continue
without interruption.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.857
We are so close
to identifying

31:42.901 --> 31:45.338
the protein in brains
that drives zombie behavior.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.861
You find that protein,

31:46.905 --> 31:48.994
and we may be able to figure out
what about the Black Rain

31:49.037 --> 31:50.996
restored consciousness
to the undead.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.867
But we're killing them
in the process.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.217
And if we do nothing,
they'll also die.

31:55.739 --> 31:58.960
There's a limited supply
of brains to feed the Talkers.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.527
And it's still inside the skulls

32:00.570 --> 32:03.008
of the very humans they need
to survive.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.835
I need more time.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.750
We don't have more time.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.623
Vigilantes are already killing
Talkers on sight.

32:09.666 --> 32:12.452
If we don't find a sustainable
substitute for brains soon,

32:12.495 --> 32:13.975
we will run out of options.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.586
I'll have no other choice
but to begin treating Talkers

32:16.630 --> 32:18.240
as if they're zombies.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.722
You can't mercy them.
Not if they're still conscious.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.898
You've seen what happens
when they're starving.

32:24.768 --> 32:28.468
You want to save the Talkers?
Figure out what woke them up.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.515
You have 48 hours.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.832
So you've known George
since Black Summer?

32:44.875 --> 32:47.966
Since before.
She was a student of mine.

32:48.270 --> 32:51.491
That is a long time to know
somebody in the Apocalypse.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.320
She was just a kid. A freshman.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.932
But there was something
about her. Even back then.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.455
A lot of good people,

32:59.499 --> 33:01.675
strong men, brave, tried to
keep us safe and together.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.112
They got killed. But not George.

33:04.156 --> 33:07.855
She just kept surviving
and took us all along with her.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.117
She seems real nice.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.641
But I know a badass
when I see one.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.167
I bet she could mercy a horde
of Zs with her eyes closed.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.559
Any chance

33:16.603 --> 33:18.735
Dante is the one helping
all these Talkers disappear?

33:18.779 --> 33:21.390
If he is,
it's for a good reason.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.872
I just can't see him
wanting to hurt humans.

33:25.307 --> 33:28.267
He's saved too many
to start killing them now.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.357
Maybe he doesn't see it
as killing them.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.447
Hey chief, over here!

33:36.579 --> 33:38.407
Three pointed sun.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.802
Looks like we're on
the right trail.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.242
Paint is still wet.

33:47.286 --> 33:50.376
Something familiar about this,
but I can't quite place it.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.247
Come on, let's catch up.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.294
Hey, over here!

33:57.600 --> 34:00.516
Could be a supply drop
for the Talker underground.

34:01.517 --> 34:04.738
Well somebody left in a hurry.
Check it out.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.088
That's Dante's. He was here.

34:08.611 --> 34:09.656
What's that sound?

34:09.699 --> 34:10.831
Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.140
Sounds like a giant bug zapper.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.275
Puppies and kittens.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.235
A whole damn litter.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.464
Let's go get some food.

34:35.508 --> 34:36.422
I'm not hungry.

34:37.814 --> 34:41.253
Well, I can make you some soup.
You liked that soup.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.689
I'm fine.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.349
They're playing a movie tonight
in the dining hall.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.786
On a real TV.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.136
Called...

34:55.180 --> 34:56.529
The Fugitive or something.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.748
Let's go.
It'll take your mind off things.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.750
I don't want to take my mind
off things.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.839
I want to get out of here.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.928
I'm...sorry.

35:04.972 --> 35:07.192
Stop apologizing.

35:07.235 --> 35:11.326
I know you only did what you did
so you could save my life.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.111
You know what? I'm not sorry.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.809
And I did do what I had to do
to save your life.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.941
With half a second
to think about it.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.465
And I'd do it again.

35:19.943 --> 35:24.470
I know. I would've done
the same thing. It's not you.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.429
You're the only thing that's
keeping me going. It's just...

35:27.995 --> 35:29.997
If I can't shoot,

35:31.129 --> 35:32.347
who am I?

35:34.088 --> 35:36.351
You're Ten Thousand.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.485
And you're the kind of shot
you are because

35:39.528 --> 35:42.140
of your mind and your eyes,

35:42.183 --> 35:44.142
not your hand.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.232
You can learn to shoot again.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.582
It's all in here.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.155
You have to start
by looking at it.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.766
I need to think.

35:59.809 --> 36:00.462
Tommy?

36:02.290 --> 36:04.640
George seems pretty sure
Dante's innocent.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.729
I mean it does seem
out of character.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.688
That guy would lay down his life
for her.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.864
Why do they think he did it?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.431
He was there
right before the blast,

36:12.474 --> 36:14.302
but he wasn't amongst the dead
or the injured.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.217
No one's seen him since.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.219
I was videotaping
the whole thing.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.048
Well where's the tape?
That would prove it.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.920
I had to hand it over to Estes
to analyze.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.749
I'd like to see that tape.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.055
There's no way.

36:29.491 --> 36:30.275
I won't get it back
until after the investigation.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.232
If then.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.974
If he's analyzing the tape,

36:34.017 --> 36:38.239
it's probably uploaded
to a server somewhere in Altura.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.849
You've got that look
in your eye.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.373
Let's hackity hack.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.765
Come on back.

36:44.245 --> 36:44.985
Go find JZ.

36:45.028 --> 36:45.681
All right.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.770
I'll get started.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.691
When's the cavalry coming?!

36:56.083 --> 36:57.563
We are the cavalry!

36:58.651 --> 37:00.392
I was afraid of that.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.233
Look left!

37:15.276 --> 37:15.885
Look left!

37:25.547 --> 37:26.374
Professor!

37:33.338 --> 37:34.600
Shit.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.821
Doc! Speed up that mercy!
We got a 911!

37:40.823 --> 37:41.868
Where are they all coming from?

37:55.838 --> 37:56.752
Henry!

38:10.288 --> 38:12.899
Damn. Have mercy.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.686
Henry

38:17.730 --> 38:19.209
I dunno. I think so.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.910
How many more times
are you gonna save my life?

38:23.953 --> 38:26.956
As many times as it takes,
my friend.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.873
I like you as a human.
Don't turn Talker on me yet.

38:32.701 --> 38:37.315
A dozen Zs from Kalamazoo
Water Park? That isn't random.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.579
What was that?

38:40.970 --> 38:43.059
Sounds like an explosion.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.932
That's Pacifica.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.151
Pacifica Base,

38:48.195 --> 38:50.676
Patrol One. Repeat your message.
We did not copy.

38:50.719 --> 38:51.807
Repeat message. Over.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.243
It's Kaya!

38:53.287 --> 38:56.203
Mayday! Mayday!
[Pacifica Outpost. Help!

38:56.246 --> 38:57.335
Kaya, it's Warren!

38:57.378 --> 38:58.205
Mayday!
Pacifica Outpost.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.249
Kaya, it's Warren!

38:59.293 --> 39:00.947
Warren! Help!

39:00.990 --> 39:02.427
You're breaking up! Kaya!

39:02.470 --> 39:05.691
Large explosion...
attack.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.519
Zombies every...

39:07.562 --> 39:10.652
I don't know
who's alive and who's dead...

39:12.350 --> 39:13.873
Mayday, mayday mayday.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.092
Hang on! We're coming!

39:16.658 --> 39:19.357
You go. I'll catch up. Go. Go.

39:54.740 --> 39:55.915
What are you doing?

39:55.958 --> 39:58.483
Sorry. I borrowed some of your
lab gear.

39:58.526 --> 40:02.704
There's got to be some way
to make 10K a trigger finger.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.141
How bout this?

40:16.196 --> 40:17.676
It's another attack.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.244
Keep your eyes open.
They could be anywhere.

40:22.376 --> 40:23.421
Oh god.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.777
Damn it.

40:35.737 --> 40:36.608
Come on.

40:36.651 --> 40:37.522
Hang on.

40:38.610 --> 40:39.828
We're not gonna do anybody
any good

40:39.872 --> 40:42.614
if we go rushing in there
and get killed.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.050
Hey.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.661
George?

40:47.183 --> 40:50.099
George George?

40:50.143 --> 40:51.013
Beth?

40:53.538 --> 40:57.150
Attacked by Zs. So many.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.108
No...chance.

41:01.284 --> 41:03.591
My baby.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.463
All...gone.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.901
So...many.

41:11.599 --> 41:12.948
We got to get in there.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.950
I can't leave her.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.517
Mercy.

41:30.531 --> 41:32.185
I give you mercy.

41:35.275 --> 41:36.494
Come on.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.591
They have no idea what's coming.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.680
It's time to move.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.682
Humans don't like being killed.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.518
JZ! Kaya!
