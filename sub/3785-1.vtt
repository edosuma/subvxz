REPORTER ON CAR MONITOR:
It has been made clear

01:13.992 --> 01:16.410
by the lack of comment
by the HydroFrac corporation

01:16.493 --> 01:18.954
that they have no intention
of listening to the people

01:19.038 --> 01:22.041
and accepting any amendments
to the controversial bill

01:22.124 --> 01:25.502
just signed into law that allows
fracking in Corvallis, Oregon.

01:25.587 --> 01:29.423
The passing of house bill 5464
must come as a personal victory to you.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.717
No comment.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.804
REPORTER 2:Humanitarian groups have
vowed to take this to the Supreme Court.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.180
Do you expect the fight to continue?

01:37.264 --> 01:40.059
I believe in the American
political and legal system.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.519
REPORTER 3:With the conflict
about the passing of this bill,

01:42.604 --> 01:44.104
do you expect
the public outcry to grow?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.148
No further comment. Excuse me.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.651
REPORTER 1:
Environmental groups have commented

01:48.735 --> 01:50.569
that as the company has grown,

01:50.653 --> 01:54.573
their policies have continued to become
further focused on quarterly profits...

02:06.669 --> 02:07.670
Hey, George.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.674
I heard you had a break-in.

02:11.758 --> 02:15.344
Just a broken window.
You hitting balls over the fence again?

02:15.427 --> 02:18.180
(chuckles) At my age,
I doubt I could even if I wanted.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.474
Ah, come on,
you look pretty quick to me.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.894
Only in the mind. (chuckles)

02:22.977 --> 02:25.520
I'll lose more than my mind
if I don't get home right now.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.774
- Jill's bringing my girl over.
- Birthday?

02:27.857 --> 02:30.484
- Not this time.
- Be careful.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.196
As much as you work she's gonna be
a grown woman before you know it.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.136
(handbrake clicks)

03:34.589 --> 03:36.718
(beeping)

03:40.847 --> 03:42.849
(keypad beeps)

03:48.020 --> 03:50.106
- Just need you to sign that.
- OK.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.859
How did the price
jump double the quote?

03:52.942 --> 03:54.693
You asked for Fort Knox.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.113
It's not the price they gave me.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.239
This the most advanced system available

03:59.322 --> 04:01.909
with fully integrated lighting,
media and security.

04:01.993 --> 04:04.078
Controllable from any cellphone
in the world.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.885
Have a good weekend.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.578
(meows)

04:48.413 --> 04:50.332
Hey, Mr Snuggles.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.212
Hey.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.548
Hm... You're awfully friendly today.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.259
(phone rings)

05:06.348 --> 05:07.934
Hi, Mom.

05:08.017 --> 05:10.895
Hi. It's been a long time.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.354
How are you?

05:13.189 --> 05:14.356
I've been busy.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.026
Too busy to call your mother?

05:17.109 --> 05:19.237
I've been in the middle
of a major deal at work.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.240
Yeah, I saw something on TV.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.034
Lobbing so that company
can poison everyone's water.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.161
What else does Oregon
have to offer, Mom?

05:27.245 --> 05:29.538
They'll pull enough energy
out of that little town

05:29.621 --> 05:31.207
to power the entire country.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.749
And you know I give to charity.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.459
Listen to yourself.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.882
Isn't this what you and Dad
always wanted? For me to be the best?

05:39.966 --> 05:43.094
No. I wanted you to be a good person.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.221
Colin, there will be
someone else out there,

05:45.304 --> 05:49.516
but you've gotta learn to
take responsibility or it'll never work.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.269
I just don't wanna see you hurt again.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.811
(pops loudly)

05:55.857 --> 05:56.983
I gotta go.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.152
Is that how you're gonna
get off the phone with me?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.737
Sammy's coming over. I have to go.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.158
I see. Well, you be good to her.

06:06.242 --> 06:08.286
You know I will.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.370
I love you, Mom.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.914
(keypad beeps)

06:42.194 --> 06:43.403
(beeps)

06:47.909 --> 06:49.035
(beeps)

06:49.118 --> 06:51.703
(chuckles) Nice.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.005

(phone rings)

08:01.399 --> 08:03.401
(phone continues to ring)

08:07.238 --> 08:08.863
Mom, let me call you back.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.949
(male caller guffaws)

08:12.284 --> 08:15.287
No, I am not your mother.

08:15.371 --> 08:19.125
- Who is this?
-Hm, wouldn't you like to know?

08:21.377 --> 08:22.877
(keypad beeps)

08:26.631 --> 08:28.633
(phone rings)

08:42.938 --> 08:44.191
Who are you?

08:44.275 --> 08:46.735
That is what I want you to answer.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.490
Prank calling got old in the '80s.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.826
I wouldn't hang up the phone
if I were you.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.079
You just might regret it.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.750
Listen, freak. Lose my number.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.214
(doorbell chimes)

09:18.808 --> 09:19.809
Hi, pumpkin.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.895
Hi, Daddy.

09:31.197 --> 09:33.907
Thanks for watching Samantha tonight.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.745
You don't have to thank me.
She's my daughter.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.332
I know, but it's not your weekend.

09:42.208 --> 09:45.252
My parents are away and it was hard
to find somebody at short notice.

09:47.463 --> 09:51.049
I won't be home till late tonight,
so I'll pick her up tomorrow.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.801
Home late, huh?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.804
Don't, Colin.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.518
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.410
(engine revs)

10:35.802 --> 10:37.596
Hey, sweetie.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.765
Here's a special present
for a special someone.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.602
- What is it?
- I don't know. You have to open it.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.987
It's the same one you got me last time.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.406
Are you sure?

10:56.365 --> 10:58.492
I colored on it for two days.

10:58.576 --> 11:00.076
It's the same one.

11:01.579 --> 11:04.165
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.001
We'll go to dinner.
I'll get you another present.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.212
- OK.
- (phone rings)

11:10.296 --> 11:12.130
Can Mr Snuggles come?

11:14.175 --> 11:17.178
No, honey.
They don't let cats in restaurants.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.847
But he will be lonely.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.434
No, honey. He'll be fine.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.228
You can play with him when we get back.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
(phone continues to ring)

11:35.737 --> 11:38.616
CALLER:I warned you
not to hang up the phone.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.328
You should have listened, Colin.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.290
Now you've put poor Samantha in danger.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.378
Who is this?

11:52.338 --> 11:56.342
That is what I want you
to answer, Colin.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.842
Who am I?

11:59.761 --> 12:01.513
I don't know.

12:03.641 --> 12:05.517
How do you know our names?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.023
What do you want?

12:12.106 --> 12:14.360
I want you to figure that out.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.698
No, I'm not figuring out shit.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.867
I don't have time for your games.

12:22.951 --> 12:28.039
We make time
for that which is important to us.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.958
I wouldn't hang up.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.797
There are always consequences
to our actions.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.635
What if I told you...

12:40.678 --> 12:43.389
...that your house is sitting on a bomb?

12:43.472 --> 12:46.350
And anyone or anything leaving

12:46.433 --> 12:49.520
would trip the sensors
engulfing your home

12:49.603 --> 12:52.230
and, well, to put it bluntly, kaboom.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.777
I'd say you're crazy.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.030
- Get help! I'm not buying it.
-(chuckles)

13:01.114 --> 13:04.158
Oh, to think, if you listened earlier,

13:04.242 --> 13:08.706
your poor little girl
would not be in danger.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.334
Keep my daughter out of this.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.752
I tried.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.630
But you brought her in.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.591
(Samantha screams)

13:19.675 --> 13:21.343
Samantha!

13:23.845 --> 13:27.349
- What happened?
- Someone was killed.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.646
Honey, I told you,
you can only watch cartoon channels.

13:32.730 --> 13:36.024
- Grown-up channels are scary.
- I didn't change the channel.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.736
(phone rings)

13:41.322 --> 13:42.531
Let's go.

13:45.743 --> 13:48.370
Can we go for dinner now? I'm hungry.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.707
I'm gonna make a special dinner
instead, OK?

13:54.042 --> 13:57.338
- Can I help make dinner?
- Of course you can help.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.256
Go in your room and play
until I'm done with this business call.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.760
Promise?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.428
Scout's honor.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.098
(phone continues to ring)

14:23.279 --> 14:25.407
What do you want from me?

14:25.491 --> 14:27.200
Money? Is that it?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.077
CALLER:I don't want your dirty money.

14:30.161 --> 14:34.500
What I want, you can't give,

14:34.583 --> 14:36.876
but I am favored
to settle for something else.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.588
Tell me.

14:40.338 --> 14:46.762
First, you must decide who I am,
what I want and why.

14:46.845 --> 14:50.849
Second, you must adhere
to the rules of the game.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.643
Game?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.436
Go to your living room.

15:04.655 --> 15:05.823
What the hell is this?

15:06.448 --> 15:10.284
A view from one of the cameras
you installed

15:10.368 --> 15:12.538
of the most advanced, impenetrable,

15:12.621 --> 15:17.375
remote-controlled laser-scanning
security system on the market.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.837
What the hell do you want?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.464
Let me state the facts.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.843
Your home is sitting on a bomb

15:25.925 --> 15:28.094
and your new wireless smart-home system,

15:28.177 --> 15:32.265
I have total control
and I've reversed the laser sensors.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.226
Things can come in,

15:35.309 --> 15:38.814
but the moment anything,
even as light as a piece of paper,

15:38.897 --> 15:42.024
leaves your house
be it door, window, chimney, anywhere,

15:42.108 --> 15:44.277
it will trip the detonator.

15:45.863 --> 15:48.574
You wanted Fort Knox. You got it.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.244
And... just like your security system,

15:53.327 --> 15:56.540
outbound calls or texts
on any cellphone inside your house

15:56.623 --> 15:58.082
will detonate the bomb.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.043
Those electrical waves
are very powerful.

16:02.336 --> 16:06.215
So, Colin, why am I
playing this game with you?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.342
I don't care. I'm not playing.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.929
Oh, you'll play, alright.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.765
Before this night is done, you'll play.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.684
(chuckles)

16:16.976 --> 16:18.978
(guffaws)

16:24.651 --> 16:26.653

16:44.880 --> 16:46.422
Nothing.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.258
Let's make dinner, shall we?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.979
Why don't we go out and eat, Daddy?

17:01.772 --> 17:03.607
I always go out and eat, honey.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.152
I wanna make something special
for you here.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.035
Looks like you're all out of special.

17:17.788 --> 17:18.997
Cute.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.337
Found it.

17:30.592 --> 17:34.220
The most special box of macaroni
and cheese. What do you think?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.931
Hm-hm.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.202
(ignition switch clicks)

18:04.918 --> 18:07.879
Daddy, are you OK?

18:08.589 --> 18:12.341
- Yes, honey, I'm... I'm OK.
- Are you sure you're OK?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.303
Sam?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.766
Does Mommy ever talk about Daddy?

18:19.850 --> 18:22.184
Sometimes she cries.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.023
She cries?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.316
She says you didn't love her.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.236
Didn't love her?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.992
Now why would she think that?

18:57.763 --> 19:00.807
(English accent)
Your very special dinner, Your Highness.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.726
Ooh!

19:11.735 --> 19:14.362
Do you like Mommy's new friend?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.990
He's OK.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.035
Are you and Mommy
ever gonna kiss and make up?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.956
It's been a year, Sam.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.833
I think we're moving on.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.836
But why?

19:30.544 --> 19:32.630
You're too young to understand.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.548
I hate it when you say that.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.175
I know.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.929
It's an honest answer.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.643
The important thing is you know
Mommy and Daddy love you very much.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.374
(knocking at door)

20:12.087 --> 20:13.714
All ready for bed?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.051
Did you brush your teeth?

20:20.846 --> 20:22.139
Let's see.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.768
Oh, you missed one.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.311
That's 'cause it's missing, silly!

20:37.361 --> 20:39.572
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Night, Daddy.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.126
A bomb?

20:55.172 --> 20:56.757
There's no way.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.632
(lock clicks)

20:58.716 --> 21:00.718
(cat meows)

21:02.804 --> 21:04.765
Hey!

21:05.681 --> 21:07.475
There you are.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.518
Where you been hiding?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.938
Hm?

21:12.730 --> 21:15.524
- You're not gonna leave me, alright?
- (purrs)

21:17.651 --> 21:20.654
Did you see someone
come in here the other night?

21:26.203 --> 21:28.038
Should've got a dog.

22:17.963 --> 22:20.381
(gunshot)

22:25.136 --> 22:26.888
(phone rings)

22:36.689 --> 22:38.607
What's wrong with you?!
You killed my cat!

22:38.691 --> 22:40.110
CALLER:Be thankful for what I did.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.946
If the cat escaped the house,
you'd all be dead.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.656
I swear to God...

22:45.739 --> 22:48.994
You need to pray to God.
I am your God, Colin.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.955
I decide whether you live or die.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.666
What the hell do you want?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.626
You're finally willing to play?

23:00.255 --> 23:01.630
Yes.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.260
I'll do whatever it takes
to make this end.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.345
Then here are the rules.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.598
I will give you five clues
to help you solve my riddle.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.018
Who am I? Here's your first clue.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.812
Hidden in your house lies the answer.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.439
An image of the one who taught.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.774
An image of what... who?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.568
Think, Colin.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.695
You have forgotten about him.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.698
(door creaks)

24:54.743 --> 24:56.912
(breathes heavily)

26:04.147 --> 26:06.149
(door creaks)

26:38.639 --> 26:40.057
(rings)

26:48.899 --> 26:49.942
(rings)

27:12.089 --> 27:13.299
Hi, Jill.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.717
Colin.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.303
How was last night?

27:18.095 --> 27:20.848
Colin, please. I'm not having
this conversation with you.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.351
Where I go and how late I stay out
is not your business.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.311
I just... I'm making conversation.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.979
Is Samantha ready to go?

27:27.938 --> 27:29.274
She's not going.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.485
What do you mean she's not going?

27:32.569 --> 27:35.696
- She's gonna stay here for a while.
- It's not your weekend.

27:35.779 --> 27:39.200
I know. She's not leaving.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.620
Colin, I don't have time to stand here
and argue with you.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.497
- I'm taking Samantha now.
- Jill...

27:44.581 --> 27:46.665
This is why
I wasn't gonna answer the door.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.042
For Christ's sake,
what's the matter with you?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.462
Is it because I went out last night?

27:52.963 --> 27:55.007
I knew I shouldn't
have asked you to baby-sit.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.469
How long do you plan to have her?

28:02.473 --> 28:03.932
I don't know.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.560
No bloody way you don't know!

28:05.643 --> 28:07.060
Jill, you can't come in here!

28:07.144 --> 28:08.812
Please.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.191
- Colin, I'm taking Samantha now.
- No.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.150
- Samantha!
- Jill--

28:13.234 --> 28:14.902
You're not keeping her! No!

28:14.985 --> 28:17.696
- Just stay out! Please!
- You're not taking her from me!

28:17.779 --> 28:19.365
Samantha, go back to your...

28:24.870 --> 28:26.331
Are you OK?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.627
Get out of my way, Colin.
Get out of my way, Colin!

28:30.709 --> 28:32.503
I can't, Jill.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.298
Go. Honey, go to your room.
It's gonna be OK.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.469
What the hell
is the matter with you, Colin?

28:40.802 --> 28:44.557
Why do you have to stir
this shit up for? Everything was fine!

28:44.641 --> 28:46.934
I'm going down there,
I'm gonna get my little girl

28:47.017 --> 28:48.353
and then we're walking out.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.522
You better pray to God that
I am kind enough to let this one go.

28:51.606 --> 28:53.857
- Jill, you can't.
- How dare you?!

28:53.941 --> 28:55.150
There's a bomb!

28:59.530 --> 29:01.073
There's a bomb.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.495
(sighs)

29:07.955 --> 29:09.624
Don't!

29:10.500 --> 29:13.001
Jill... what are you doing?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.796
Don't! No! Stop!

29:34.815 --> 29:36.817
(pants)

29:36.900 --> 29:38.902
(phone rings)

29:48.496 --> 29:50.331
Hello? I need help!

29:50.415 --> 29:52.082
CALLER:What's the matter?

29:52.165 --> 29:54.669
I'm trapped!
Call the police! Please help me!

29:54.752 --> 29:59.798
Hm. Colin and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.

29:59.881 --> 30:05.178
Colin fell down and broke his crown
and Jill came tumbling after!

30:07.806 --> 30:09.850
Hey, you listen, you creep!

30:10.976 --> 30:14.855
- You leave her out of this!
-Too late. I told you to be careful.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.566
(hangs up)

30:24.948 --> 30:26.908
I'm so sorry, Jill.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.829
If anyone leaves, we all die.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.586
(Jill gasps)

30:46.219 --> 30:48.431
I don't know who he is.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.892
But it's his game.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.480
We've gotta play by his rules.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.859
(sighs)

31:01.985 --> 31:04.154
He's got a bomb rigged to the house.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.452
And this...

31:09.535 --> 31:14.289
If you call or text...
it's like pushing the button ourselves.

31:57.542 --> 31:59.544
(door creaks)

33:07.235 --> 33:09.237
(breathes heavily)

33:15.495 --> 33:17.497
(phone beeps)

33:19.582 --> 33:21.584
(breathes heavily)

33:49.737 --> 33:51.739
(beeps)

34:11.634 --> 34:12.842
COLIN: Don't.

34:14.302 --> 34:18.098
I can't do this.
I can't be stuck in this house with you.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.059
Get me out of here.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.143
Get your daughter out of here!

34:29.275 --> 34:30.652
(phone rings)

34:52.842 --> 34:54.509
Alex Miller.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.930
CALLER:Congratulations.

34:58.014 --> 35:01.182
You have solved the first clue.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.476
Give me the second clue.

35:03.560 --> 35:08.024
First, I want you
to dig deep within yourself.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.445
Tell me what's so important about the
relationship you had with your father.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.156
- How the hell would I know?
-(scoffs)

35:17.074 --> 35:19.242
Your language says a lot
about who you are.

35:21.161 --> 35:26.917
You use it to control people, push
them around, bend them to your will.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.339
What do you want?

35:32.422 --> 35:37.302
For now I want you to recognize
that you're holding on to the past.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.931
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:41.015 --> 35:43.475
It's obvious, Colin.

35:43.558 --> 35:48.856
Obvious that your father
led you to believe that you were a loser

35:48.939 --> 35:51.483
and that you're still holding
on to that anger,

35:51.566 --> 35:55.487
determined to prove to the world
that you are a winner.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.530
You know nothing about me.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.826
Come on, Colin. Don't try and fool me.

36:00.910 --> 36:03.328
(guffaws)

36:07.540 --> 36:09.250
How do you know my father?

36:10.251 --> 36:13.130
Answer that, you'll know who I am.

36:13.213 --> 36:16.050
I already gave you the answer.
Now give me the second clue!

36:17.467 --> 36:20.637
Your second clue is Simon.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.862
(thunder)

36:38.655 --> 36:40.657
(computer keys click)

36:47.707 --> 36:49.917
What are you doing?

36:50.583 --> 36:52.669
Looking for a Simon.

36:52.753 --> 36:55.005
What did you do to him?

36:55.089 --> 36:57.133
I make most my clients a lot of money.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.678
What about the enemies
you've created with your lobbying?

37:01.762 --> 37:05.015
Organizations? Environmental groups?
I don't know. I don't know!

37:06.307 --> 37:08.309
(thunder)

37:44.721 --> 37:47.682
- Aasim!
- What are you doing here?

37:47.767 --> 37:50.186
Listen to me.
You need to call the police.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.897
You better explain to me
why I wait for you, like, an hour

37:52.980 --> 37:54.439
and then I find you here with him!

37:54.522 --> 37:58.235
No, no, no! I had no choice!
There's a bomb under the building.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.694
Just get the police!

37:59.779 --> 38:01.571
(phone rings)

38:04.200 --> 38:08.037
CALLER:I have a nice little surprise
waiting for you. Go to the dining room.

38:23.219 --> 38:24.594
Oh, my God!

38:24.677 --> 38:26.763
No, no, no. Please! No, no, no.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.891
You've gotta go! He's gonna kill you!

38:28.974 --> 38:30.184
What the hell is doing here?

38:30.267 --> 38:33.478
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what's going on.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.273
CALLER:Oh, Jill,
you always pick the wrong men.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.442
Look at her, Colin. Why would your wife
cry for another man?

38:41.736 --> 38:43.197
See how kind I am to you?

38:43.280 --> 38:46.826
I present you a gift
many husbands wish for.

38:46.909 --> 38:50.328
Yes, Colin, this is the man
that is screwing your wife.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.831
No! No.

38:51.914 --> 38:55.333
All you have to do is say so
and I will make him go away.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.710
- No, no, no. I never slept with him!
-She's lying.

38:57.794 --> 39:01.714
Aasim is his name.
That is the name she calls out in bed.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.092
Jill, tell the truth.

39:03.175 --> 39:06.553
- Colin, look at me.
-Yes, look how she cries for him.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.471
Because he doesn't deserve this!

39:09.139 --> 39:10.515
(gunshot)

39:10.598 --> 39:12.350
(gasps)

39:13.768 --> 39:15.436
I said tell the truth, Jill.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.438
(sobs) OK, OK, OK!

39:18.815 --> 39:21.818
I did.
But never when we were together!

39:21.902 --> 39:23.778
Hear that, Colin?

39:25.197 --> 39:27.824
Look at the man who stole your wife.

39:27.908 --> 39:29.367
No one will ever know it was you.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.453
Just say, "Do it."

39:32.829 --> 39:34.039
Don't.

39:34.123 --> 39:36.250
Need some motivation, Colin?

39:36.333 --> 39:40.963
Jill... let's hear
you call out Aasim's name.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.216
Jill? I want you
to call out Aasim's name.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.052
Make it hot or your boyfriend dies.

39:47.136 --> 39:48.929
OK.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.808
Oh, God... Aasim...

39:54.684 --> 39:56.228
Please! Yes!

39:56.312 --> 39:57.938
What do you say, Colin?

40:03.944 --> 40:05.362
No.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.241
He doesn't deserve it.

40:09.325 --> 40:11.160
My, my.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.744
What happened to your attitude

40:12.827 --> 40:16.081
that doesn't give a shit
about anyone but Colin Miller?

40:17.249 --> 40:19.960
Why don't you tell Jill
about your infidelities?

40:21.502 --> 40:22.545
What?

40:22.629 --> 40:24.881
Jill had to tell her truth,

40:24.965 --> 40:28.218
but at least you were separated
when she screwed another man.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.844
But you...

40:29.929 --> 40:32.555
Were you a faithful husband?

40:33.431 --> 40:34.641
- Yes.
-Oh!

40:35.642 --> 40:39.146
What do you fear most? The truth
or Aasim's blood on your hands?

40:39.229 --> 40:42.815
Did you ever cheat on Jill?

40:42.899 --> 40:44.026
No.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.526
(gunshot)

40:45.610 --> 40:47.695
(groans)

40:47.779 --> 40:50.698
- OK... I did.
-The next will be certain to kill.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.118
You did what?
Careful. Aasim depends on you.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.079
I cheated, Jill.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.207
- Our marriage was on the rocks.
-How many?

40:58.290 --> 41:00.334
- We barely even spoke.
-How many?

41:01.210 --> 41:03.003
Three.

41:03.087 --> 41:05.755
A beautiful wife like Jill
and still not good enough.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.881
Do you get off on this?

41:06.966 --> 41:09.426
Wrecking people's lives
for your own sick pleasure?

41:09.509 --> 41:11.220
Oh, every dog has its day.

41:11.303 --> 41:14.390
How many lives did you destroy
for your pleasure?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.516
I don't know.
I've never tortured people!

41:16.599 --> 41:18.268
-What about that poor Simon?
-Who?

41:18.352 --> 41:21.355
The one you harmed
who hung himself from a bridge.

41:21.438 --> 41:22.772
I've never hurt a Simon--

41:22.855 --> 41:27.403
It deeply disturbs me that you can cause
such tragedy in somebody's life

41:27.485 --> 41:28.945
and it can mean so little to you.

41:29.029 --> 41:31.531
You live in your luxury--

41:31.614 --> 41:33.825
You call this luxury?
My wife has left me.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.286
I never see my daughter anymore
and I live in this house alone.

41:36.370 --> 41:39.831
You did that to yourself,
but what did Simon ever do to you?

41:39.914 --> 41:40.915
I don't know!

41:41.000 --> 41:45.379
You have one minute to remember his name
or Aasim's blood will be on your hands.

41:45.462 --> 41:46.629
You have to remember.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.091
- I am trying.
- Think! Think! You have to remember!

41:49.174 --> 41:50.967
- I don't remember!
- Come on! Try!

41:51.051 --> 41:54.512
- I'm trying!
- (shouts hysterically)

41:54.595 --> 41:55.888
(phone rings)

41:55.972 --> 41:58.392
- Just stop it!
- (phone rings)

42:01.228 --> 42:03.105
Listen, I need more time.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.981
CALLER:You've had plenty of time.

42:05.065 --> 42:08.860
- Give me another clue!
-S-s-s-stuttering Simon.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.696
- Jill, say goodbye to your lover.
- No!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.074
- What did you say?
- No.

42:14.158 --> 42:16.035
-Five...
-Who's Simon?

42:16.118 --> 42:17.785
- Four...
-Stop!

42:18.328 --> 42:23.708
Three, two... one.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.626
Simon Stiller!

42:29.048 --> 42:30.382
Hello?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.385
Congratulations.

42:34.802 --> 42:37.972
You just saved someone's life.

42:38.057 --> 42:41.101
Your next clue is Penelope.

42:44.063 --> 42:45.522
Penelope?

42:50.319 --> 42:51.861
(thunder)

43:02.331 --> 43:03.998
- Oh, my God.
- (Aasim groans)

44:04.601 --> 44:06.603
(phone rings)

44:09.814 --> 44:12.484
Because I can't risk
a missing persons' report,

44:12.568 --> 44:15.903
I'm going to have to increase
the pressure on you, Colin.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.698
I'm giving you until midnight
to answer "Who am I?"

44:18.781 --> 44:20.576
What do you mean until midnight?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.286
What time is it now?

44:23.077 --> 44:25.205
No. I asked you a question.

44:25.289 --> 44:27.123
8:36.

44:28.208 --> 44:32.795
That is three hours
and soon to be 23 minutes.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.715
Lots of time.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.426
COLIN:Answer me.

44:38.635 --> 44:40.304
What happens at midnight?

44:40.387 --> 44:44.183
Under your house
sits ammonium nitrate,

44:44.266 --> 44:48.645
an innocent ingredient commonly found
in household plant fertilizer,

44:48.728 --> 44:53.941
that at midnight will instantly expand
into a cloud of superheated air,

44:54.025 --> 44:59.947
ripping through wood, sheet rock
and finally human flesh.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.033
(ticks)

45:04.286 --> 45:06.120
The clock has started.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.417
What?

45:20.843 --> 45:22.638
He said under the house.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.306
Under the house.

45:44.409 --> 45:45.952
(screw pings as it hits the floor)

46:37.086 --> 46:39.464
- (beeps)
- JILL: We're gonna die.

46:39.548 --> 46:40.881
Don't say that.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.676
There has to be a way out.

46:43.552 --> 46:46.012
Whoever the caller is,
he knows you made fun of Simon.

46:46.095 --> 46:48.390
He must have known you
from a long time ago.

46:48.473 --> 46:51.476
- I can't even remember a week ago.
- Who else have you pissed off?

46:51.560 --> 46:55.564
- You are not helping.
- I don't give a fuck.

46:55.647 --> 46:57.649
Jill... Jill!

47:00.569 --> 47:01.986
Jill, wait.

47:04.323 --> 47:06.450
I'm sorry, OK?

47:06.533 --> 47:08.618
- Who's Penelope?
- I don't know a Penelope.

47:08.702 --> 47:10.329
Is she one of your three whores?

47:11.371 --> 47:12.872
I can't do this right now, Jill.

47:12.955 --> 47:17.377
We are living in a bomb. This is gonna
end everything in a couple of hours.

47:17.461 --> 47:20.797
The least you can do is let me die
with the comfort of knowing.

47:22.882 --> 47:24.426
Why can't you just face it?

47:25.176 --> 47:29.180
Yeah, OK, great.
Let's just pretend it didn't happen.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.641
I mean, what do you care?

47:31.725 --> 47:34.894
You had your fun.
Got the life you wanted.

47:35.604 --> 47:37.397
The life I wanted?

47:37.938 --> 47:40.107
- The life I wanted, Jill?
- Just leave me alone.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.486
No. You wanna face it,
then let's face it!

47:42.569 --> 47:45.071
I didn't ask for this, Jill!
You walked out on me.

47:45.154 --> 47:46.448
No, you asked for it.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.533
Asked to find my wife and daughter gone?

47:48.617 --> 47:52.244
And how long did it take you
to notice, huh? Two days.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.329
I was working!

47:53.413 --> 47:55.873
Working and screwing other women.

47:59.711 --> 48:01.463
You know, you don't get to blame me.

48:01.546 --> 48:04.006
- You never even would talk to me.
- You were never here!

48:04.090 --> 48:05.717
I was building this life for you.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.469
For me?

48:08.428 --> 48:10.137
What life, Colin?

48:10.888 --> 48:13.974
Sadness? Loneliness?

48:15.811 --> 48:17.687
I'll tell you what you built.

48:18.772 --> 48:21.065
Nothing but horrible memories.

48:22.066 --> 48:26.278
(sobs) Along with this big extravagant
house, sitting on a ticking time bomb!

48:28.197 --> 48:31.410
Well, thank you, Colin Miller
for a wonderful life!

48:50.386 --> 48:52.304
I-I'm sorry.

49:06.862 --> 49:09.989
I thought things
were over between you two.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.912
It's not your fault.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.917
I know what it feels like
to... to have lost someone.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.548
My wife... she died from cancer.

49:29.801 --> 49:32.219
But I still have a beautiful family.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.640
A boy and a girl.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.939
I wanna see them again.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.569
COLIN:
I would have liked to have had more.

49:49.738 --> 49:52.031
Well, why didn't you?

49:52.114 --> 49:54.743
Too busy working.

50:01.625 --> 50:04.418
Jill didn't wanna be a single mother.

50:08.422 --> 50:12.594
Work gives you no love
and home gives you no money.

50:15.597 --> 50:17.516
But one thing I know for sure...

50:20.852 --> 50:22.896
...is you get a lot more happiness

50:22.979 --> 50:26.232
from the things you work on
that don't pay you money.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.738
Like family.

50:37.117 --> 50:39.119
Guess I learned the hard way.

50:45.376 --> 50:46.795
(phone rings)

50:49.005 --> 50:51.925
CALLER:Time is running out.
I need you to remember.

50:53.009 --> 50:54.343
I don't know a Penelope.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.054
(scoffs) No, no.
You don't remember a Penelope.

50:57.137 --> 51:00.725
You don't remember because
you fucked with people without a care.

51:00.809 --> 51:03.770
Because of you she never thought
she was good enough.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.313
She dated men
who confirmed that she wasn't,

51:06.397 --> 51:07.857
but now... now you care.

51:07.941 --> 51:10.944
How does it feel
to be on the other side?

51:11.736 --> 51:13.738
I don't know what you're talking about.

51:14.948 --> 51:18.242
- Is she your daughter?
-No.

51:18.325 --> 51:21.580
- Do you love her?
-No.

51:21.663 --> 51:24.874
I'll help her. I'll pay for
her treatments at the best clinics.

51:24.958 --> 51:26.417
That's not how we play this game.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.378
I ask the questions, you answer.

51:29.461 --> 51:32.506
They'll help you figure out
the question, who am I?

51:32.591 --> 51:35.677
So, think Colin.
How do you know Penelope?

51:35.760 --> 51:38.972
I'm sorry. OK?

51:39.055 --> 51:41.515
I'm sorry I don't listen,
I'm sorry I don't remember

51:41.600 --> 51:43.350
and I'm sorry for all that I've done.

51:43.434 --> 51:47.271
Liar! You're sorry
that you're trapped in your home.

51:47.354 --> 51:50.107
You're sorry that your life
hangs in a memory

51:50.190 --> 51:52.526
that's too trivial for you to remember.

51:52.611 --> 51:55.071
No, no, no, Colin.
I want you to suffer to remember.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.531
To know what it feels like
to be screwed over

51:57.616 --> 52:01.745
by a compassionless prick whose good
fortune puts him in better standings!

52:01.828 --> 52:03.537
I have given you great clues.

52:03.622 --> 52:06.540
Come on, Colin.
You're a highly successful lobbyist.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.125
Piece it together.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.711
What if I can't piece it together?

52:09.794 --> 52:11.713
You and everyone you love dies.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.048
Why would you let us go?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.842
Huh? Why?

52:15.925 --> 52:19.428
Tell me. Why would you let us go?
What if I just let the time tick away?

52:19.511 --> 52:21.014
Stop answering your phone calls?

52:21.097 --> 52:23.140
- Tell you to go fuck yourself?
- (keypad beeps)

52:26.602 --> 52:28.730
He can see us.

52:28.813 --> 52:30.314
What?

52:31.273 --> 52:33.275
He's watching us from inside.

52:34.653 --> 52:36.362
He knows what we're doing.

52:37.989 --> 52:39.991
He always knows the moment to call.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.527
(computers beep)

53:25.327 --> 53:26.746
I'm done playing his game.

53:40.342 --> 53:42.344
(rings)

53:42.762 --> 53:43.972
Don't answer it!

53:44.055 --> 53:46.223
(rings on loudspeaker)

53:48.559 --> 53:51.311
(♪Requiem: Dies Iraeby Mozart
blasts over hi-fi ♪)

53:54.648 --> 53:56.067
(phone rings)

53:59.695 --> 54:02.656
CALLER:This is my game!

54:02.741 --> 54:06.161
I warned you what would happen
if you didn't follow the rules.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.288
Go ahead. Blow us up.

54:09.371 --> 54:12.125
First, a reminder of who is in control.

54:13.584 --> 54:17.213
A fun little game
called Save Your Wife.

54:21.176 --> 54:23.178
(whirs)

54:23.887 --> 54:26.430
Do you see that, Colin?

54:30.852 --> 54:34.563
I bet Jill's life
that you're going to do as I say

54:34.646 --> 54:37.066
and answer all of my questions.

54:39.693 --> 54:42.529
What do you want me...
what do you want me to answer?

54:42.613 --> 54:43.948
You never deserved Jill.

54:51.998 --> 54:54.458
She is too good for you.

54:55.709 --> 54:59.881
Had she been mine, I would have been
a fantastic husband to her.

55:00.672 --> 55:02.508
She deserves that.

55:03.927 --> 55:07.096
Tell me... was she a good lover?

55:08.097 --> 55:10.557
I can only imagine what it felt like,

55:10.641 --> 55:14.813
her soft warm skin
pressed up against yours.

55:16.355 --> 55:17.564
Look at her.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.818
(thunder)

55:19.901 --> 55:24.655
Something I would like.
Something I think about all the time.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.660
Look how beautiful she is.

55:31.079 --> 55:32.704
How could you let her go?

55:33.413 --> 55:35.208
How could you cheat?

55:36.500 --> 55:42.464
I wanna hear you say,
"I never deserved Jill."

55:44.466 --> 55:45.509
Say it!

55:48.221 --> 55:49.848
Say it!

55:51.057 --> 55:53.725
-Say it!
-Get out of here!

55:57.105 --> 55:58.564
(whirs)

55:59.606 --> 56:01.276
Shoot me!

56:02.151 --> 56:05.196
Go on! Shoot me, you bastard!
End this game!

56:14.956 --> 56:16.958
(gunshots)

56:46.486 --> 56:48.488
(groans)

56:48.572 --> 56:51.117
- Oh, my God. Your shoulder.
- I'm fine.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.626
Take your shirt off.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.382
(groans) OK.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.388
(sighs)

57:13.389 --> 57:14.890
Jesus.

57:14.974 --> 57:16.976
Ow.

57:21.897 --> 57:23.149
It's not deep.

57:32.908 --> 57:34.534
(groans)

57:43.585 --> 57:45.129
Jill...

57:49.425 --> 57:51.510
What made you stop loving me?

57:54.680 --> 57:56.515
I never stopped.

58:01.478 --> 58:05.941
You know, Aasim's a good friend,
but I never felt--

58:06.025 --> 58:08.027
(phone rings)

58:10.487 --> 58:13.740
You have to answer it
before he does something else crazy.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.578
CALLER:This is not a therapy session.

58:18.662 --> 58:22.333
I'm not here to help you fix your life.
I'm here to make you regret it!

58:23.376 --> 58:27.005
Then make me regret it.
Let the others go. It's me you want.

58:27.088 --> 58:30.299
Look at your watch.
You're running out of time.

58:31.092 --> 58:34.886
Your lack of memory disturbs me! Think!

58:34.970 --> 58:37.015
Alex. Penny. Simon. Rachel.

58:37.098 --> 58:41.144
It's all in a box
that is forgotten and covered in dust.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.439
Samantha is depending on you.

58:46.482 --> 58:48.192
You're out of clues.

58:48.276 --> 58:49.651
No.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.363
You're out of a game.

59:07.211 --> 59:08.712
(rings on loudspeaker)

59:10.922 --> 59:12.632
(shouts) Pick up, you dumb fuck!

59:12.716 --> 59:15.344
(engaged dial tone)

59:15.428 --> 59:17.804
Son of a bitch! This is my game!

59:17.888 --> 59:19.265
(yells) This is my game!

59:42.788 --> 59:44.706
Why is Daddy so upset?

59:45.665 --> 59:48.001
- Because he's scared.
- Of what?

59:51.422 --> 59:52.964
Of losing us.

59:53.048 --> 59:55.176
Why don't you love him?

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:04.726
You can watch a movie
until you get tired.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.853
I'm gonna go check on Daddy, OK?

01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:12.943
(squawks)

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.616
(sighs)

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.665
(thunder)

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:39.428

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:58.156
(door creaks)

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.784
(thunder)

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:19.050
It's definitely forgotten about
and covered in dust.

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:33.982
(sighs) Oh, my God.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.172
Do you remember this?

01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:03.471
COLIN: Hillside.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.534
COLIN:I feel like such a jerk.

01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:28.704
I created this whole mess.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.209
I'm gonna get us out of this, Jill.

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:37.087
I promise. I'm not gonna
screw this up again. I'll fix it.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.008
I just...

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:45.053
I just wanted those feelings back.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.767
When we first got together.
Fresh out of college.

01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:53.271
No money.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.358
We lived in that old trailer.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.027
But we did what we wanted.

01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:06.575
We lived. Really lived.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.041
(beeps)

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.254
JILL:But it wasn't about that.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:26.304
It was just about us.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:33.101
You know? When you know the other person
is always gonna be there for you.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.020
But you weren't, Colin.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.902
You slowly disappeared.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.700
And it really, really hurt.

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.994
Because I didn't want the things
you bought me.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.625
I just wanted those feelings back.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:03.048
(phone rings)

01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:10.263
I was just thinking about myself.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.393
I don't know. I wanted more.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:16.687
I wanted to be someone.

01:04:18.356 --> 01:04:20.441
Do something important.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:24.986
But after you left, none of it mattered.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.990
I was empty.

01:04:29.492 --> 01:04:31.660
And I knew
I should have stopped you, but...

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.623
I was afraid to go after you.

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:38.376
Put myself on the line
and tell you how I felt.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.381
I wasn't perfect either.

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:48.009
I never really told you
how much I appreciated you

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.596
and everything you did for us.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.849
But... I just need you to know

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:56.226
no matter what happens...

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.062
...I'm sorry.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.733
(muffled scream)

01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:11.282
(whimpers)

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.494
(groans)

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:28.299
(gunshots)

01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:32.178
(gunshot)

01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:47.653
I'm so sorry.

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:49.738
(phone rings)

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.622
CALLER:For once you can't beat me.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:03.334
Haven't you learned
that every time you don't play nice

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:05.086
something bad happens?

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:06.714
(beeps)

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.965
You had five minutes
to escape your house.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:11.426
No direction sensors.

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:15.806
Here's what happened
during those five minutes...

01:06:19.894 --> 01:06:20.977
Bring her back!

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.688
Go ahead! Pull the trigger!

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:25.608
I'd love to see
whose future you destroy.

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:31.655
Just step out that door.

01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:32.989
Come on!

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:36.494
Your final vision will be me
carrying her away to be her new daddy.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:39.497
(screams and sobs)

01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:48.797
- What is it you want?
- Who am I?

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:50.173
You're a dead man!

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.968
- Who am I?
- A dead man!

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:57.640
(sobs)

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:05.188
(engine starts up)

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:34.133
(vomits)

01:07:39.807 --> 01:07:41.474
AASIM: He's never gonna let us leave.

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:46.104
He's gonna kill us.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.693
Why would you bring me here?

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.864
Six years at MIT
so I could die like a swine?

01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:03.538
What did you say?

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.960
- I said "swine."
- No.

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:11.797
You said you went to MIT.

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.300
What did you study?

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.094
Electrical engineering.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:21.514
Electrical engineering.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.272
You can disarm this bomb.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.149
I-I don't work with bombs.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.443
- What's the difference?
- Big difference!

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.486
You've worked in dangerous situations.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:38.907
High voltage. Yeah?

01:08:41.035 --> 01:08:42.620
What would happen if you messed up?

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:44.830
I'd die.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.707
Exactly.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.799
(classical music plays)

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:21.573
It's just wires, right?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.952
(beeps)

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:25.662
Right.

01:09:25.746 --> 01:09:28.082
(beeps)

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.712
I-I can't.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:35.714
No, no. You have to.

01:09:35.798 --> 01:09:37.215
I-I can't do this.

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.426
You're our only hope.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.386
Your family's only hope.

01:09:43.889 --> 01:09:46.390
- It's just--
- Just do it for them.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.482
(groans)

01:09:56.694 --> 01:09:58.987
(grunts)

01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:00.739
(thunder)

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.244
(classical music plays)

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:47.243
(grunts)

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.394
(screams)

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.480
(beeps)

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:34.749
Where are you?

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:37.920
(sighs) You're somewhere close.

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:43.633
Somewhere where you can see
this house blow up.

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:02.485
The Hillside.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.210
(coughs)

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:19.794
(whimpers)

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:46.654
(phone rings)

01:12:53.996 --> 01:12:55.205
Hillside High.

01:12:56.874 --> 01:12:58.541
We went to high school with him.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.669
(sighs) Penelope.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:03.922
Penny Wynbert.

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:08.969
She had a crush on you.

01:13:10.262 --> 01:13:13.348
The guys teased you about it,
so you pulled mean pranks on her.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.017
Simon Stiller.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.144
Who you nicknamed
Stuttering Simon Stiller.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:19.729
- Rachel--
- Westin. She was dirt poor.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:22.607
You teased her to the point
she didn't wanna come to school.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.692
(phone continues to ring)

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.486
- And my father.
- The teacher.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.990
He was harder on you
than any other student at school.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.741
Embarrassed you in front of class.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.791
Hillside High.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:42.127
CALLER:Very good.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.669
But who am I?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.298
Listen... I'm sorry.

01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:49.717
I was young and foolish.
That's not who I am today.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.677
I didn't know the pain
that I was causing.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:55.765
You didn't know when everybody was
laughing at S-S-Stuttering Simon Stiller

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.225
that it wasn't fun for him?

01:13:57.309 --> 01:14:02.314
Hm? You didn't think you had any part
in making him hate himself?

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.690
Now he's dead and you didn't even know.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.986
Just like the people
will be in Corvallis.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:10.113
I gave you an answer!

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:11.906
Let me speak to my daughter!

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.491
Your daughter? Not anymore.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:17.578
(laughs) This is like
the fairy tale Rumpelstiltskin.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:20.748
I keep your firstborn
unless you guess my name,

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.917
except I doubt
there will be a happy ending.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:24.669
Tell me she's OK.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:27.172
(yells) Tell me!

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:28.881
That's up to you, Colin.

01:14:28.966 --> 01:14:34.012
She'll be alive for about...
I guess, 20 minutes, give or take.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.940
God, Colin!
Why did you have to be such an asshole?

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.949
(thunder)

01:15:15.095 --> 01:15:16.887
Jesus.

01:15:22.102 --> 01:15:23.936
We were best friends.

01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:26.356
He moved to Corvallis, Oregon.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.691
Mechanical engineering school.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.777
(beeps)

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.790
(rings)

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.588
Hello?

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:35.217
(whispers) Mommy?

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.053
Yes, baby. It's me, it's me.
What did he do to you?

01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:43.141
He... gave... pills.

01:16:43.225 --> 01:16:45.435
(sobs) Where are you?

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.354
Can you describe it to me?

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:50.315
SAMANTHA:I can see... city.

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:52.691
Two towers.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.112
(sobs) I'm so scared.

01:16:55.195 --> 01:16:58.198
Don't be. I'm coming.
I'll coming for you. I promise, OK?

01:17:00.117 --> 01:17:01.284
Baby?

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.579
Samantha?

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.581
(sobs) Samantha!

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.209
Samantha!

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:11.128
(thunder)

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.231
The lightning...

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:34.984
How long did it take to hear the thunder
on the phone after you saw the flash?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.069
I don't know.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:41.740
If you can remember,
I might be able to find Samantha.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:48.415
Uh... Uh, I heard the thunder at the
same time I saw the lightning strike.

01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:52.084
Good. Do you have map?

01:17:52.169 --> 01:17:53.295
- Yeah.
- Where?

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:54.546
It's down there.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:58.175
I saw the lightning flash
outside that window.

01:18:00.302 --> 01:18:04.264
When I was a kid I'd count the seconds
until I heard the thunder arrive.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:07.850
If it was instant over the phone,
it took seven seconds to arrive here.

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:10.978
I can create a vector
and determine a location.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.318
Where's your cellphone?

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:21.448
Careful.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.744
First, we align the map to true north.

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.958
Next, we extend the vector
towards the lightning.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.214
Pen.

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.467
Grab a tape measure.

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:42.176
Here.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.099
Hold.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:59.277
Next, we calculate the distance.
The sound travels at 761 miles an hour.

01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:02.112
It took seven seconds to arrive here.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:06.825
She should be approximately...
1.47 miles away.

01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:17.920
Vulcan Park.

01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:29.890
How much longer?

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:33.436
Uh, I don't know.
It's between these two.

01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:36.648
(beeps)

01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:38.525
A 50-50 chance.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:41.902
The wrong one and we die!

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.202
Pick one.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:56.710
Pick one and cut it.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.421
- I don't know which one it is!
- Cut the goddamn wire!

01:19:59.504 --> 01:20:02.549
(sobs) I don't know which one it is!

01:20:04.718 --> 01:20:06.218
I'm sorry.

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:12.141
Listen to me, Aasim.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:18.565
Of all the men who could have
dated my wife, it was you.

01:20:19.399 --> 01:20:20.816
An electrical engineer.

01:20:23.778 --> 01:20:25.613
It's not a coincidence.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:29.784
Because of that...

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.455
...I believe
we weren't meant to die today.

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:37.166
I believe God
will help you choose the wire.

01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:41.170
So cut it.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.816
(beeps)

01:21:16.748 --> 01:21:19.041
(beeps)

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.799
(beeps rapidly)

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.178
(both laugh)

01:21:33.848 --> 01:21:35.517
(phone rings)

01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:42.732
CALLER:Congratulations! You just
bought yourself a little more time.

01:21:42.816 --> 01:21:45.777
You see, for your effort,
I'll give you ten additional minutes

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.319
to answer my question.

01:21:47.404 --> 01:21:51.990
But first, I set the alarm to rearm
after one person leaves.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:55.745
The internet can tell you
a lot about someone.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:59.541
Like Aasim's background in electronics.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.544
You have 60 seconds to send Aasim home.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.130
Or I will detonate the bomb.

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:15.013
No, no. No. No, this isn't right.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:16.348
It's a trap.

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.852
No, I-I go out there, he kills me.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:21.688
If he wanted you dead,
he would have already killed you.

01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:24.064
Think he's gonna let me walk free?
Talk to the cops?

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:25.775
45 seconds. You have a better idea?

01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:27.943
JILL: He won't kill you.

01:22:29.529 --> 01:22:32.990
You haven't answered his question. Go.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:34.617
For Samantha.

01:22:35.535 --> 01:22:38.455
No way, Jill.
No, I'm staying here until the end.

01:22:38.538 --> 01:22:41.165
I want you to go. I want you
to find a new life, start over.

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.501
Don't you get it? He has Samantha!

01:22:43.585 --> 01:22:46.378
- You're the only one who can save her.
- I can't leave you here!

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.964
Yes, you can! You can! Promise me.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:51.300
Promise me you'll save her! Promise me!

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:25.125
(beeps)

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.562
(tires screech)

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:59.786
(horn blares)

01:24:22.725 --> 01:24:25.394
(horns blare)

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.633
(horn blares)

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:06.184
(tires screech)

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.964
(thunder)

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.908
(door creaks)

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:53.936
(birds squawk)

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:15.166
(electronic crackling over loudspeakers)

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:02.088
(classical music plays)

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.593
(electronic crackling)

01:30:30.384 --> 01:30:31.718
(grunts)

01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:48.361
(breathes heavily)

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.906
(thunder)

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:02.041
Sam! Samantha!

01:31:02.124 --> 01:31:04.251
You'll wake her.

01:31:05.419 --> 01:31:07.046
- Sam!
- I said quiet!

01:31:12.385 --> 01:31:14.636
COLIN: What did you do to her?

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.764
I find it fascinating your house
faces the Vulcan statue.

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:21.143
- COLIN: What did you do?
- Greek god of fire. My favorite.

01:31:21.227 --> 01:31:24.646
- What did you do to my daughter?
- Zolpidem tartrate.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.649
She'll wake up in a few minutes.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:32.570
You know, the Vulcan
was born from two beautiful gods.

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:37.159
He was small and ugly.

01:31:39.245 --> 01:31:40.997
So atrocious, in fact...

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.541
...his mother threw him over a cliff.

01:31:45.418 --> 01:31:49.005
But he escaped
and set a dangerous trap

01:31:49.088 --> 01:31:52.466
and tortured her until death
for his revenge.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.634
Is that what you plan for me?

01:31:55.677 --> 01:32:00.807
It took a lot longer than I expected
for you to join me in this moment.

01:32:03.227 --> 01:32:07.189
This moment when all your mistakes
collide in a raging inferno,

01:32:07.273 --> 01:32:09.358
teaching you the lesson of your life.

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:14.447
Look through the telescope.
Tell me what you see.

01:32:16.198 --> 01:32:18.451
Look through the telescope!

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.539
That's right!

01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:27.084
I'm your Vulcan now

01:32:27.168 --> 01:32:31.380
and in three minutes you will watch

01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:35.301
as everything you love goes up in flames

01:32:35.384 --> 01:32:37.844
because of what you've done.

01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:42.183
Who am I?

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:47.729
Hillside High.

01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:51.816
Senior year, 1996.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.070
You moved to Oregon for engineering.

01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:01.535
James... Colbourne.

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:04.037
(thunder)

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.347
Congratulations.

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:24.974
You finally remembered
one of the... littler people.

01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:32.941
It's too bad you didn't think about us
before your latest achievement.

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:34.859
(thunder)

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:38.947
Forcing all the working class
out of Corvallis,

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:43.285
so your client can drill all the natural
resources, leaving us with nothing.

01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:46.663
Why do people like you always blame
everyone else for their failures?

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:49.542
Blame?! No!
You couldn't care less who you hurt!

01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:55.713
As long as you can live
in your rich house, feeding your ego!

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:58.633
My ego? This is about you being jealous!

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:02.596
Of what? You know nothing about me!

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:09.727
I... am dealing justice.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:13.232
Justice?

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:15.024
What did Aasim ever do to you?

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.820
I am teaching you.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:21.240
- You're a murderer!
- This is my game!

01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:22.782
It's gonna end with you on death row!

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:24.868
(thunder)

01:34:29.165 --> 01:34:30.957
I made mistakes.

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:33.001
There are no excuses.

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:38.174
The car, my house...
they're just mortgages and loans.

01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:40.800
- I don't own a thing.
- Bullshit!

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:42.677
You're always first place!

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:45.972
Taking everything from me
since high school,

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:49.268
friends, jobs, Jill.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.230
You're right. I deserve this.

01:34:53.314 --> 01:34:56.107
But please let my family go.

01:34:56.192 --> 01:34:58.485
I'm begging you.
They didn't do anything to you.

01:35:04.533 --> 01:35:05.992
Colin...

01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:15.919
(beeps)

01:35:21.342 --> 01:35:22.551
No.

01:35:27.473 --> 01:35:30.183
This time I'm first place.

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:34.521
It's time you understood

01:35:34.605 --> 01:35:39.485
what it feels like
to have everything you love destroyed!

01:35:41.278 --> 01:35:42.988
I begging you! Please! Don't do this!

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:48.619
- Ten, nine, eight...
- No, no, no.

01:35:48.702 --> 01:35:52.956
- Seven, six, five...
- (yells) Jill did nothing to you!

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:57.628
Four, three, two...

01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:00.880
- (screams)
- Run! Run, Sam, run!

01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:09.055
(beeps)

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.270
(beeps rapidly)

01:36:37.418 --> 01:36:38.835
(grunts)

01:37:11.702 --> 01:37:15.789
I regret our friendship
had to end this way.

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:24.798
Someday, James,
you will look into the mirror,

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:28.635
and I promise you're gonna despise
the man staring back at you.

01:37:29.428 --> 01:37:31.095
Goodbye,...

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:34.223
...Colin Miller.

01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:38.102
(grunts)

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:41.690
(groans)

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:45.234
(gunshot)

01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:49.030
(grunts)

01:37:58.039 --> 01:37:59.874
(grunts)

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:01.959
(railings clang)

01:38:04.797 --> 01:38:06.757
Give me your hand.

01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:24.273
I'm never gonna let you go again.

01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:07.609
REPORTER:
With the escalating public outcry

01:39:07.693 --> 01:39:10.194
and pressure
from online petition websites,

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:13.615
it comes as no surprise that an insider
has recently leaked documents...

01:39:13.699 --> 01:39:15.576
Hey! What are you doing?
Slow down there!

01:39:15.659 --> 01:39:19.162
..revealing HydroFrac's unlawful
political bribery on Capitol Hill.

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:21.414
So far they've refused
to officially comment,

01:39:21.498 --> 01:39:25.586
but unofficially it's believed that all
future drilling operations in Corvallis

01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:28.589
will be put on hold indefinitely.

01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:31.550
It looks like someone finally
did something good in their life.

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.927
Colin, what's going on
with those burgers?

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.262
Well, it's a bit
of a learning curve here.

01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:38.139
AASIM: Those look pretty well done.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:40.517
- Yeah, they're medium-rare inside.
- Hm.

01:39:41.518 --> 01:39:43.729
So, I heard the interview went well.

01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:47.231
- Yeah, yeah. In spite of your referral.
- Ouch.

01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:50.109
(laughs) They pretty much
offered me the job on the spot.

01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:52.821
- We may have to move to DC, though.
- Hm...

01:39:52.905 --> 01:39:54.948
Well, it's not every day
you find an engineer

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.366
who's used their skills to save lives.

01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:00.537
I owed you for that.

01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:03.874
- Stay off K Street.
- (chuckles)

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:05.709
Are those burned yet?

01:40:05.792 --> 01:40:07.418
(Colin chuckles)

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:12.966
Alright! Are we ready?

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:17.596
If it's a boy,
I think you should name him Aasim.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.557
Aasim Miller.

01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:23.184
- My name does mean protector.
- Aw!

01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:25.979
Well, what does your fiancée
think about that?

01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:28.899
- Right. There is that.
- (chuckles)

01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:30.233
(phone rings)

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:31.735
I'll get it.

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:35.531
(rings)

01:40:41.410 --> 01:40:42.871
Hello?

01:40:42.955 --> 01:40:44.998
(hangs up)
