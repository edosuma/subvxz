01:03.397 --> 01:06.300
Last week on Married With Children
Marcy had a little announcement. ;

01:06.500 --> 01:08.735
Jefferson and I are pregnant.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.105
Al was the first to congratulate
the happy couple.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.110
Yeah, Al was happy until. ;

01:17.344 --> 01:19.479
I'm pregnant too.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.449
The family rejoiced together.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.986
Bad Daddy. Bad, bad, bad.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.823
As if what you did wasn't bad enough,
but with our mother, for God's sake.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.559
Jefferson is the perfect husband.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.362
Here it is. I drove 50 miles...

01:35.562 --> 01:37.531
...holding it so cherries
didn't settle on the bottom.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.199
And Al couldn't do
enough for Peggy.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.602
Al, get me some water.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.674
And now, " Married With Even
More Children" continues.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.882
Hey, here's something interesting.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.117
For just $49.95...

01:57.317 --> 01:59.620
...us dads can buy "Buckle-on Baby."

02:00.420 --> 02:02.222
You get a 50-pound sack
of fluid on your belly...

02:02.422 --> 02:04.892
...to experience the wonder
of childbearing...

02:05.325 --> 02:08.729
...and the excruciating pain
of a hernia for one low price.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.702
Well, I don't know about you kids, but
I'm really happy about the new baby.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.038
The gods must be on a roll, huh?

02:18.238 --> 02:21.141
Must be playing another round of
"Can you top this?"

02:21.341 --> 02:22.809
One said, "Make him a shoe salesman."

02:23.010 --> 02:24.878
Another said,
"Let's give him a redhead."

02:26.146 --> 02:29.149
Another one, probably
a cruel, hung-over God...

02:29.349 --> 02:33.220
...said, " I know, I know, let's have
him not eat, yet not starve."

02:34.054 --> 02:36.890
Yes, Daddy, but the gods showed you
they loved you when they gave you us.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.226
Well, give them gods a Miller.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.530
Could someone please tell me
how this happened?

02:43.730 --> 02:47.734
Well, Dad, when the ovum is embedded
securely in the wall of the uterus...

02:47.935 --> 02:50.270
...the sperm, after about
two or three days of swimming...

02:50.470 --> 02:53.173
...if properly positioned,
penetrates the wall of the egg.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.176
And then the stork comes
and it's a baby.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.117
Bud, in all matters,
except vandalism and fashion...

03:04.318 --> 03:06.854
...I want you to be in charge
of educating the baby.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.990
Hey, you did the crime,
you do the time.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.361
God, I feel like Exxon. One spill,
I'm paying for it the rest of my life.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.069
Come on, Daddy,
look on the bright side.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.872
I mean, how long could the rest
of your life be?

03:25.739 --> 03:29.376
Come on, Kel. Can't you see the man's
plotting his next sexcapade?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.746
- Let's finish setting up this intercom.
- What intercom?

03:33.113 --> 03:36.750
The one Mom wants us to put in every
room so you can't have any peace.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.320
Sorry, Daddy, you wet your bed,
now lie in it.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.959
I guess I'll turn on the TV. At least
that can't reproduce. Damn shame.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.529
Thank God I don't have to hear
any more talk about babies.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.131
You're pregnant, Mindy.

03:51.331 --> 03:54.501
What a lovely baby.
Where'd you find it, Hoss?

03:54.701 --> 03:58.539
What's that, Lassie? Our cow just
had a baby and you ate the placenta?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.682
- My baby...
- Her baby...

04:10.450 --> 04:13.320
Babies declare war on Lithuania.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.591
God, that's just how I left him.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.927
You will never guess
where we went, Al.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.462
To Madame Rachel,
the baby psychic.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.730
She was amazing.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.333
For starters, she knew
that I felt bloated...

04:26.533 --> 04:29.536
...had morning sickness,
and that my nipples hurt.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.006
I didn't think
that was possible with innies.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.612
Al, don't you want to hear what
the psychic had to say about our baby?

04:38.812 --> 04:41.682
Please, Peg, can't we hear
more about Marcy's nipples?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.351
Well, gee, Al, if we're so boring...

04:44.551 --> 04:46.954
...then maybe we should talk
about something that interests you.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.689
For starters, let's talk about...

04:48.889 --> 04:52.759
...what goes through your mind at that
exciting moment when you sell a shoe.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.830
I think, " How could someone buy
something so cheap, ugly and stupid?"

04:57.030 --> 05:01.001
Then I think, "Somebody knocked up
my neighbour, so anything's possible."

05:06.473 --> 05:08.242
Oh, yeah, honey,
anything's possible...

05:08.442 --> 05:11.778
...except both of us
being satisfied after sex.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.649
That was a good one, wasn't it?
Yeah, we got your daddy good.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.417
Come on, Al, laugh with the baby.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.419
I don't wanna.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.723
If someone didn't know you, they'd
think you weren't happy about this.

05:22.923 --> 05:27.027
Oh, I'm happy about it. I mean,
after all, it's something we planned for.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.364
Oh, I love the baby.
Everyone loves the baby.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.800
God, I hate the baby.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.536
I hate Mom.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.672
I mean, you can't blame Dad.
He's a stupid animal...

05:38.839 --> 05:41.208
...but Mom knew what she was doing.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.144
Kelly, is that button on?

05:44.611 --> 05:47.548
Of course not.
One says "on" and one says "off."

05:47.748 --> 05:50.150
How stupid do you think I am?

05:51.818 --> 05:55.055
Well, I for one love the baby.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.664
What do you mean?
Why are you poking at me, gnome?

06:05.265 --> 06:06.633
They can hear us?

06:07.701 --> 06:10.037
I "wuv" the baby too.

06:10.237 --> 06:14.641
And I really, really, really love Mom.
Which damn button is on?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.977
Why do they have to
both start with an 0?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.515
And soon there'll be three.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.724
God, I wish Jefferson
was here. Rub my belly.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.459
He's my husband
and he's rubbing my belly.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.829
I'm not rubbing any occupied bellies.
I'm a human being.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.639
Oh, yeah, soon I'll be
partying like 1999.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.343
- Isn't this nice?
- You should have Jefferson do this.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.346
You can just feel the fatherhood
flow through you.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.681
Al, I don't feel the fatherhood
flowing through me.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.985
Well, you may not have felt it,
but it's obviously there.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.523
That's not the first time
he's said that to me.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.429
We got him good again.
Come on, Al, laugh with the baby.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.398
I don't wanna.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.134
Besides, I don't think you're pregnant.
That's a 10 gallon can...

07:14.334 --> 07:16.270
...of ice cream down there.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.073
Come on, Peg, laugh with the ulcer.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.915
Now, don't make
the baby hate you. Rub.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.655
God, he's depressing.
I want Jefferson.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.257
- So do I.
- So do I.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.893
At least he'll be here soon.
He's out getting me a wave machine.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.329
At the baby expo, at the
"hundred dollar and over" booth...

07:42.529 --> 07:44.798
...we learned that babies
like the sound of water.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.300
Al, I want a wave machine.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.235
I think the baby's
getting plenty of waves...

07:48.435 --> 07:52.372
...with turbulence of the daily arrival
of your four Grand Slam breakfasts.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.209
Have you tried the
Six Corn Dog Special at Bippys?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.744
Every day on the way
to Flap Jack Johnny's.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.281
You ever transport Bippys corndogs
to Johnny's and roll it up in a flapjack?

08:01.481 --> 08:05.385
With the ranch dressing and those
chunky croutons from the salad tub?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.721
- Now, that's eating.
- Now, that's eating.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.523
Peg, Peg, speaking
of eating, I too enjoy...

08:09.723 --> 08:12.292
Less talk. More rub.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.397
So Al, when do I get
my wave machine?

08:17.598 --> 08:20.834
- Not getting one.
- You don't know how much it costs.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.637
I didn't think it was important,
since I'm not getting one.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.007
Al, you don't want Marcy's baby
to be smarter than ours, do you?

08:27.207 --> 08:30.277
Peg, our other kids didn't have a wave
machine and look how they turned out.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.047
Mom, Bud has more
fingers than I do.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.852
Honey, did you try
counting on both hands?

08:41.488 --> 08:43.190
Hey.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.129
Not because they
didn't have a wave machine.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.865
That's because your parents
were brother and sister.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.303
That is not true.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.506
They just started to look alike
when Mom's hair fell out.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.178
Oh, come on, Al,
I want a wave machine. It's only $329.

09:04.444 --> 09:08.148
Oh, thank you, God, that's exactly
the price of my socket wrench set.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.817
You know, this is amazing.
You are actually gonna tell me...

09:11.018 --> 09:14.421
...you would rather spend money on a
socket set than the fruit of your loins.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.290
You know I had my
heart set on that socket...

09:16.490 --> 09:18.158
- What?
- Oh, Al, now look what you've done.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.762
I'm crying. And so's the baby.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.634
I'm crying too.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.070
I hope you're happy now.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.907
- Rub our bellies!
- Rub our bellies!

09:36.977 --> 09:39.246
Hold it. Enough. Enough.
I'm getting up.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.014
Now you see me going.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.383
Really, Al? You're really going?

09:43.717 --> 09:46.954
Yes, Peg. I'm really going.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.394
Bus for Scranton
now loading, gate 15.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.104
Another one, buddy?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.275
God, what a great place.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.810
I mean, it's genius.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.646
A bar hooked up to the public-address
system at the bus terminal...

10:12.846 --> 10:15.182
...so you don't miss your
connection for leaving your wife.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.653
Don't forget about the cheap bimbos.
They give the place class.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.055
- So where you headed, pal?
- I don't know.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.057
Someplace where
there's a lot of girls, no women.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.592
Oh, L.A.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.766
You might want to use
one of our new instant ID machines.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.147
It's genius.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.715
Hair dye. Get your hair dye.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.285
False moustaches, bulbous noses!

10:52.853 --> 10:56.056
Bus to Tacoma now loading,
gate six.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.596
Let her try and find me now.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.704
Hey, you want to hear a sad story?

11:11.772 --> 11:15.509
My wife's having another baby
and I think it's mine. The end.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.312
Hey, buddy, you gonna let go
of that dollar?

11:18.512 --> 11:19.947
Oh, I'm sorry, here you go.

11:24.485 --> 11:26.253
My next door neighbour's
having a baby too.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.055
God, what a weenie.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.091
Even has a weenie name. Jefferson.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.427
Mr. Perfect Husband.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.263
Waiting on his ferret-face of a wife.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.500
I'll tell you something,
when that guy rolls over...

11:39.700 --> 11:42.202
...and has to look at that...
Hey, Jefferson.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.908
I was just talking about the
neighbour on the other side.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.512
You know, his name is Jefferson.
He's having a baby too.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.480
What do you think about that?

11:54.948 --> 11:55.949
So, what are you doing here?

11:56.149 --> 11:59.019
I'm running like a river
when the snow melts.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.923
It was the baby expo, Al. It broke me.
You should have seen it.

12:03.123 --> 12:08.162
It was nothing but acres of fat,
pregnant women wearing Keds.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.865
Why are you running, Al?

12:12.266 --> 12:14.768
Can you look at me
and seriously ask that?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.504
Don't take an oxen that
works with his yoke...

12:17.704 --> 12:19.673
...for 20 years, take the yoke off,
and then say:

12:19.873 --> 12:22.075
"Oh, Just kidding. Here's a
heavier yoke for you, old fella.

12:22.276 --> 12:23.577
Toss it on and rub my belly."

12:23.810 --> 12:25.679
Well, you should rub
the belly I've been rubbing.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.114
I have.

12:31.285 --> 12:32.719
What you watching?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.589
Nothing. I'm just listening
to Mom eat on the intercom.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.358
Is there anything left for us to eat?

12:38.559 --> 12:40.360
Oh, sure. Why don't you
go and stick your hand...

12:40.561 --> 12:42.362
...through the door
and see what happens.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.604
I see the only chance of me getting
any food, love or attention any more...

12:50.804 --> 12:53.106
...is if the baby comes out
looking like you.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.345
But then again, what are the chances
of Mom having two circus monkeys?

12:59.246 --> 13:01.915
Why, the odds must be one in nine.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.121
Excuse me, is there
anybody down there?

13:08.322 --> 13:10.924
My buck et o' tapioca is empty.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.629
Bud, look what we've become.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.499
Pudding slaves to Mount Mom.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.670
Yeah, I don't know
how Dad can put up with it.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.540
After all he's been through, he's
out doing something nice for Mom.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.710
Well, good. Then he'll be home
soon and he can fill her trough.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.113
You wanna go to a movie?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.350
I can't. You know, I checked
that box under my bed.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.552
Someone stole all my money.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.322
Al.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.093
Al.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.563
Al. Look, just because we're leaving
our pregnant wives alone...

13:49.763 --> 13:51.932
...to fend for themselves
without a cent in the world...

13:52.132 --> 13:53.500
...that doesn't make us bad, does it?

13:53.734 --> 13:56.003
Heck, no. Many is
the great American before us...

13:56.203 --> 13:57.738
...who have skipped out
on the needy.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.341
Take, for example, The Rifleman.
He knew not to hang out with his wife.

14:01.542 --> 14:04.244
You know, I always suspected that's
who he was blowing to smithereens...

14:04.444 --> 14:06.246
...before the start of each show.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.051
I've been thinking. I mean, I'm almost
done with her first trimester.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.621
What if the worst is over and it's all
good from now on and we miss out?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.058
- What?
- I'm finally starting to understand...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.728
...how she got you.
Let me explain something to you.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.764
There is no such thing
as a trimester.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.467
There's actually
just one long 40-year "mester."

14:27.668 --> 14:31.171
When they get pregnant, it turns
into what I call the "mini-mester."

14:31.371 --> 14:35.642
You got your fat-mester,
you got your puke-mester...

14:35.843 --> 14:38.278
...and Lord help us,
you got your horny-mester.

14:41.415 --> 14:42.983
That's when I left.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.490
So, Al, where you gonna go to?

14:49.690 --> 14:53.260
Somewhere where shoe men
run wild and free in the big sky.

14:54.495 --> 14:57.464
Where never is heard
an impregnated word...

14:57.664 --> 15:00.100
...and the hooters
are uncovered all day.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.740
That's beautiful, Al, that's beautiful.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.244
Monacles, family trees, gum.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.547
Gentlemen, would you like
to be somebody?

15:13.780 --> 15:15.382
Your shirt.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.255
How much for an ex-football
player with a cool name?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.757
- Two hundred dollars.
- What can I get for a buck?

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
A shoe salesman named Al.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.165
Give me some gum.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.633
There you go.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.737
Hey, I'll pick my own name, huh?

15:36.937 --> 15:39.072
My new name will be...

15:40.641 --> 15:42.176
...Bazooka Joe.

15:44.178 --> 15:46.980
Damn. I wish I'd thought of that
before I decided on...

15:47.181 --> 15:48.749
...Anheuser-Busch.

15:49.750 --> 15:53.053
Yep, the Buschmeister's
going to Seattle.

15:53.854 --> 15:56.323
Join up with some friends
that have a lobster boat.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.927
And I'm gonna be
the mighty fisherman.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.863
- How about you, Al?
- Going to L.A.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.199
Gonna be the big white
hooter hunter.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.572
- God, life is gonna be great.
- Yep.

16:11.772 --> 16:15.375
Bus to Seattle now leaving, gate 11.

16:17.678 --> 16:20.447
- Well, back to the wives?
- Yeah, back to the wives.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.783
If she has another baby in the
next 18 years, I'm going.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.384
Me too.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.789
Well, I'm going home.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.691
Can I have my dollar back?

16:32.726 --> 16:34.194
Here's five. Take a cab.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.529
Five?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.867
Can I have some change?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.844
Oh, hi, honey. Come lay beside me.

16:52.980 --> 16:55.349
There is no beside you, Peg.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.385
Watch the cookies, honey.

16:59.987 --> 17:02.890
So you went to the bus station, huh?

17:03.090 --> 17:06.627
- How'd you know?
- Marcy has Jefferson miked.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.864
Hi, Marcy, I'm home.
You look beautiful.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.534
Thank you... Anheuser.

17:16.837 --> 17:18.872
You just couldn't leave, could you?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.339
I knew you wouldn't be able to.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.010
You love your little Pooh Bear,
don't you?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.916
You do, you do.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.617
I really don't.

17:33.453 --> 17:37.057
So, Al, what's in the bag?
Your socket set, huh?

17:37.257 --> 17:40.227
Oh, well. You know, if one of our
children grew up to be a success...

17:40.427 --> 17:43.163
...who would the street sweepers
of tomorrow be?

17:45.999 --> 17:50.204
Oh, Al, a wave machine!

17:50.404 --> 17:53.140
Oh, you do care, don't you?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.843
Peg, touch me with even
one lip, I take it back.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.645
You know, the only reason
I wanted this...

17:58.846 --> 18:02.115
...is so that at least one of our children
would have every opportunity in life.

18:02.316 --> 18:05.252
I mean, you saw what not having one
did for the other two.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.988
Oh, what a pair of misfits.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.824
But you know, Peg, the baby's
already got one up on the other two.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.392
He's already smarter than Kelly.

18:12.593 --> 18:15.062
And he's closer to a woman
than Bud will ever be.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.970
What a pair of losers.

18:25.339 --> 18:27.474
Honey, are you sure
that intercom is turned off?

18:27.641 --> 18:30.043
Sure, I'm sure. There's an "on" switch
and an "off" switch.

18:30.244 --> 18:32.412
Why, how dumb do you think I am?
