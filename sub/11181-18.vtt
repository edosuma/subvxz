WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.866
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:05.005 --> 00:07.835
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.973 --> 00:12.391
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.529 --> 00:15.187
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.325 --> 00:18.156
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.294 --> 00:22.263
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.816 --> 00:26.405
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.543 --> 00:29.029
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:29.167 --> 00:31.652
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.790 --> 00:34.206
Just to get up that hill

00:34.344 --> 00:36.829
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.967 --> 00:39.384
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.522 --> 00:42.007
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:42.145 --> 00:43.767
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.905 --> 00:46.494
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.632 --> 00:49.704
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.842 --> 00:54.054
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:54.192 --> 00:57.022
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:57.160 --> 00:59.990
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:00.129 --> 01:06.756
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.345 --> 01:11.312
Um, put it over there.

01:11.450 --> 01:13.280
No, no, no. Over here.

01:14.246 --> 01:16.386
I just can't decide
where it should go.

01:16.524 --> 01:18.940
Well, you better hurry up
and decide, or it's going
over the balcony.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.737
Okay, just put it
down there.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.050
That's it, Weezy.
I ain't moving
no more furniture.

01:25.188 --> 01:26.948
But, George...

01:27.087 --> 01:28.433
Look, do you know what
they call a woman who works
her husband too hard?

01:28.571 --> 01:29.848
What?
A widow.

01:32.506 --> 01:35.612
Quit complaining, George.
The living room
needs a change.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.580
That's the same thing
you said last year.

01:37.718 --> 01:40.030
And after we moved all
the furniture you decided
you liked the way we had it.

01:40.169 --> 01:42.136
Well, it doesn't
hurt to experiment.

01:42.274 --> 01:44.138
The hell it don't!
My back is killing me.

01:45.829 --> 01:51.456
George, do you know what
it's like looking at the same
old thing day after day?

01:51.594 --> 01:54.079
Tell me about it.
I've been looking at you
for the past 25 years.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.704
Ain't you got no sense
of humor, Weez?

01:58.842 --> 02:02.777
Of course I have.
I married you, didn't I?

02:03.088 --> 02:04.952
Oh...

02:05.090 --> 02:07.817
Miss Jefferson, ain't you
decided where to put
the furniture yet?

02:07.955 --> 02:10.371
No, I just can't
make up my mind.

02:10.509 --> 02:12.649
Well, if you ask me...
Who's asking you?

02:14.410 --> 02:17.965
George, Florence can say
what she wants.
Go on, Florence.

02:18.103 --> 02:19.691
Everything looked fine
where it was.

02:19.829 --> 02:21.486
Who's asking you?

02:23.004 --> 02:24.489
You know,
when I was a child,

02:24.627 --> 02:27.181
it seemed to me every time
I turned around
our furniture was changed.

02:27.319 --> 02:28.596
Oh, your folks
kept moving it?

02:28.734 --> 02:30.253
No, it kept
getting repossessed.

02:32.807 --> 02:36.949
George, let's try
moving the sofa over there.

02:37.087 --> 02:38.054
Oh, Weezy...

02:38.192 --> 02:39.400
Oh, come on, George.

02:42.748 --> 02:46.269
Well, are you gonna help,
or are you too busy
holding down the floor?

02:47.581 --> 02:49.099
You didn't ask me
to help you.

02:49.238 --> 02:52.344
Oh, okay. Florence dear,
would you mind giving us
a hand with the sofa?

02:52.482 --> 02:53.587
Of course not.

03:01.042 --> 03:02.803
See? All you had
to do was ask.

03:04.874 --> 03:06.979
You know, Weez, I think
I'm gonna give her a raise.

03:07.463 --> 03:08.878
A raise?
Yeah.

03:09.016 --> 03:10.742
Maybe if we
pay her enough,
she can afford to quit.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.539
Okay, George, ready?

03:14.953 --> 03:16.886
Ready.
One,

03:17.024 --> 03:19.337
two, three...

03:20.476 --> 03:21.684
George!

03:21.822 --> 03:23.824
Weezy, it ain't polite
to keep people waiting.

03:28.138 --> 03:29.209
Coming!

03:32.764 --> 03:36.457
Hey, Marcus... Marcus!

03:36.595 --> 03:40.150
Hey, Mr. Jefferson.
With that thing in your
ear, you can't hear me.

03:40.772 --> 03:42.118
That's the idea.

03:43.671 --> 03:45.432
Just kidding.

03:45.570 --> 03:47.606
Here's your cleaning.
Thank you.

03:47.744 --> 03:51.886
Man, oh, this place
looks like it was hit
by a tornado.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.060
No, it wasn't a tornado.

03:53.198 --> 03:54.441
It was Hurricane Louise.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.995
We're redecorating, Marcus.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.411
Oh. Well, have fun.

03:59.549 --> 04:02.242
Hey, Marcus, you finished
working downstairs,
ain't you?

04:02.621 --> 04:03.864
Yeah. Why?

04:04.002 --> 04:06.591
Well, how would you like
a chance to work upstairs?

04:06.729 --> 04:07.695
You're moving your store?

04:07.833 --> 04:09.628
Uh-uh.
We're moving furniture.

04:09.766 --> 04:10.940
Well, I'll see you later...

04:11.078 --> 04:12.597
Come on, come on,
come on. It'll be more fun.

04:12.735 --> 04:14.254
More fun than what?

04:14.392 --> 04:16.601
More fun than me
doing it by myself.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.223
I heard that.

04:18.361 --> 04:20.225
Okay, let's start
with this desk here.
Okay.

04:28.958 --> 04:31.616
Well, where do
you want it?

04:32.410 --> 04:34.377
I haven't made up
my mind yet.

04:34.515 --> 04:36.793
Well, I made up my mind.
It's going back where it was.

04:36.931 --> 04:38.312
But, George...

04:38.450 --> 04:40.176
Look, Weezy,
I just wanna get it out
of the way.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.143
Okay, but it's not
gonna stay there.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.836
It's gonna stay there
unless you move it.
Come on, Marcus.

04:47.770 --> 04:49.012
What was that?

04:49.150 --> 04:51.014
I don't know.
Maybe somebody
blew a fuse.

04:51.152 --> 04:52.706
Ready?
Ready.

04:55.398 --> 04:57.780
GEORGE: Hey!
LOUISE: George! George,
are you all right?

04:57.918 --> 04:59.989
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm all right.
I just tripped
over the phone.

05:00.127 --> 05:02.336
What happened
to the lights?
MARCUS: They went out.

05:02.474 --> 05:03.544
GEORGE: I can see that.

05:06.202 --> 05:09.516
LOUISE: I can't see anything.
George, I'm scared.
Where are you?

05:09.654 --> 05:11.414
GEORGE: Right here.
LOUISE: Right where?

05:11.552 --> 05:12.726
GEORGE: Over here, Weez.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.590
LOUISE:
But I can't... Ow!

05:16.177 --> 05:18.801
Whose dumb idea
was it to put
this chair here?

05:18.939 --> 05:19.974
GEORGE: Yours.

05:21.493 --> 05:24.393
LOUISE: Oh.
Oh, there you are.

05:24.531 --> 05:26.602
Put your arm
around me, okay?

05:26.740 --> 05:28.983
MARCUS: Okay. As long as
Mr. Jefferson don't mind.

05:29.605 --> 05:30.882
LOUISE: Marcus!

05:33.885 --> 05:36.474
FLORENCE: Hey,
all the lights went out.

05:36.612 --> 05:39.269
GEORGE: That, Florence,
is amazing.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.720
You can't sneak
nothing past her.

05:42.997 --> 05:44.171
Open the drapes.

05:49.314 --> 05:50.833
The lights
are out everywhere.
LOUISE: Oh...

05:50.971 --> 05:52.317
GEORGE: Oh, you're
kidding me. Oh, no.
MARCUS: Oh, man.

05:52.455 --> 05:54.319
LOUISE: You mean,
we're having a blackout?

05:54.457 --> 05:57.011
Unless everybody in New York
decided to go to bed
at the same time.

05:59.186 --> 06:00.843
MARCUS: I wonder how
long this is gonna last?

06:00.981 --> 06:02.500
GEORGE: As long
as the electric company

06:02.638 --> 06:03.708
can rook us out
of some more money.

06:03.846 --> 06:06.469
That's why
they call them Con Edison.

06:06.607 --> 06:09.161
It's a good thing
Con Edison
doesn't own the moon,

06:09.299 --> 06:10.956
or that would
be out, too.

06:11.094 --> 06:12.820
Look, Weezy,
we need some more light.
Would you get the flashlight?

06:12.958 --> 06:14.788
It's not here.

06:14.926 --> 06:17.480
What? How many times did
I say to keep the flashlight
where we can find it?

06:17.618 --> 06:19.931
I will when you bring
it back from the store.

06:20.069 --> 06:22.830
Oh. Well, get
us some candles then.
We need some more light.

06:22.968 --> 06:25.385
Good idea.
There's some candles
in the kitchen.

06:25.523 --> 06:26.938
FLORENCE:
Wait, I'll go with you.

06:27.076 --> 06:28.664
I wanna eat
some of that chicken
in the refrigerator.

06:30.838 --> 06:32.633
How can you eat
at a time like this?

06:32.771 --> 06:34.739
Somebody gotta eat it
or it'll spoil.

06:34.877 --> 06:37.327
Too late for that, Florence.
You spoiled it when
you cooked it.

06:42.816 --> 06:47.130
Greetings, Mr. J. I see
you're as much in the
dark about this as I am.

06:47.268 --> 06:48.856
Bentley, would you get
that light out of my face?

06:48.994 --> 06:51.238
Oh, I'm sorry. I just
wanted to make sure
you were all right.

06:51.376 --> 06:53.205
Oh, yeah,
we're all right,
Mr. Bentley.

06:53.343 --> 06:57.313
Hello, there, Marcus. I am
experienced when it comes
to blackouts, you know.

06:58.487 --> 07:00.834
You should be. You've been
blacked out for years.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.216
No, I mean,
because of the war.

07:04.354 --> 07:06.564
I remember once when
I was a lad in London,

07:06.702 --> 07:10.671
my Aunt Constance and my
Uncle Trevor gave a birthday
party for their butler.

07:10.809 --> 07:13.398
It was during an air
raid, and one of the
bombs fell on our local

07:13.536 --> 07:16.712
power station.
All our lights went out.
It was terrible.

07:17.402 --> 07:19.508
I never saw
my aunt again.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.302
You mean, she got killed
in the bombing?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.994
Uh, no. She ran off
with the butler.

07:24.513 --> 07:26.722
I found the candles, George.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.344
Anybody want
some chicken?

07:28.482 --> 07:30.657
BENTLEY: Oh, splendid idea.
Food and song.

07:30.795 --> 07:32.141
Song?

07:32.279 --> 07:34.799
Yes, that's how we used
to pass the time during
the bombing.

07:34.937 --> 07:36.628
Oh, I just love to sing.

07:36.766 --> 07:39.666
Hey, they could
have really used you over
there in London, Florence.

07:39.804 --> 07:42.427
As an air raid siren.

07:43.842 --> 07:45.637
Now let's see, how about...

07:45.775 --> 07:47.777
Row, row, row your boat

07:47.915 --> 07:49.676
Gently down the stream
Row, row, row your boat

07:49.814 --> 07:51.505
GEORGE: Hey, cut it!

07:51.643 --> 07:52.299
FLORENCE:
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

07:52.437 --> 07:54.059
Not now!

07:54.197 --> 07:56.303
Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily
Have some chicken.

07:57.753 --> 08:00.307
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

08:00.445 --> 08:03.137
Hey, be quiet!
We gotta figure out
what to do.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.972
George, a little music
wouldn't hurt, you know.

08:10.110 --> 08:12.871
That ain't no music.
That's ear pollution.

08:13.009 --> 08:15.149
If you want music,
I can turn on my radio.

08:15.287 --> 08:19.222
Oh, splendid idea.
They may have some news
about the blackout.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.812
RADIO ANNOUNCER: For all
you dudes and foxes
at the drive-in,

08:22.950 --> 08:27.886
take a breather
and check out the screen.
The movie ain't running.

08:28.922 --> 08:30.924
We're having another
blackout in New York.

08:31.062 --> 08:35.204
Police report scattered
looting in Bedford-Stuyvesant
and the South Bronx.

08:35.342 --> 08:38.310
GEORGE: Give me that!
We'll have more details
as they come in.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.762
But now,
a golden oldie perfect
for the occasion.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.765
Little Richard singing,
By the Light of the Moon.

08:46.180 --> 08:47.975
Ain't that a drag?

08:48.113 --> 08:49.977
What you talking about?
I like Little Richard.

08:51.254 --> 08:52.704
I ain't talking about
Little Richard.

08:52.842 --> 08:54.188
I'm talking about
them looters up
in the South Bronx.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.156
I got a store
in the South Bronx.
Come on, Marcus.

08:56.294 --> 08:57.329
Where we going?

08:57.467 --> 08:59.159
Up to my store
in the South Bronx.

08:59.297 --> 09:01.057
We gotta get the
clothes out of there before
the looters get there.

09:01.195 --> 09:04.129
But, George, it'll be
dangerous out there.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.373
And besides, your store
is insured, isn't it?

09:06.511 --> 09:07.823
No, it ain't.

09:07.961 --> 09:09.583
What?

09:09.721 --> 09:11.827
I can't get insurance
in the South Bronx.
It's a bad risk area.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.276
Is there anything
I can do, Mr. J?

09:13.414 --> 09:14.623
Yeah, you can lend me
your flashlight.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.107
Oh, certainly.
See you later, Weez.

09:16.245 --> 09:19.075
George!
Don't worry, Weezy, I'll be
back in a flash.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.908
Oh, I hope George knows
what he's doing.

09:24.046 --> 09:26.600
Probably not.
But that ain't never
stopped him before.

09:28.015 --> 09:29.810
Well, in the meantime...

09:29.948 --> 09:31.640
Mairzy doats
and dozy doats

09:31.778 --> 09:33.193
BOTH:
And liddle lamzy divey

09:33.331 --> 09:34.643
A kiddley divey too

09:34.781 --> 09:35.713
Wouldn't you?

09:35.851 --> 09:36.852
Have a banana?

09:36.990 --> 09:38.543
Mairzy doats
and dozy doats

09:53.627 --> 09:55.422
MAN: How much you think
we'll get for this stuff?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.943
Shh! If we get caught,
about six months.

10:03.810 --> 10:05.328
Oh, see there? What did
I tell you, Marcus?

10:05.466 --> 10:06.778
Looks like somebody's
been here already.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.538
Yeah. Maybe we ought to
come back in the morning.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.333
Marcus, come on.

10:12.128 --> 10:13.095
Look at this place.

10:13.233 --> 10:14.717
Mmm, mmm, mmm, Lord...

10:15.476 --> 10:17.547
There's some clothes.
Yeah.

10:19.377 --> 10:21.068
What you doing here?

10:21.206 --> 10:22.829
What are you doing here?
This is my store!

10:22.967 --> 10:25.107
Wrong, brother.
We was here first.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.799
And that makes it
our store.

10:27.937 --> 10:29.111
Look, I own this place.

10:34.288 --> 10:36.359
You own this place?
That's right.

10:36.497 --> 10:39.155
This is the
Jefferson Cleaners, and
that's George Jefferson.

10:39.293 --> 10:41.571
You're jiving.
Afraid not, chump.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.021
You see the name
on them credit cards?

10:46.059 --> 10:48.061
He's right.
He does own this place.

10:48.889 --> 10:50.477
Sorry, Mr. George Jefferson.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.168
We ain't gonna take
none of these clothes.

10:52.306 --> 10:53.342
You're damn right
you ain't.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.930
We'll just take
your wallet.
What?

10:57.898 --> 11:00.245
And I'll be taking
yours, too.

11:00.383 --> 11:02.696
Hurry up, chump,
I got an itchy
trigger finger.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.353
Yes, sir.

11:04.491 --> 11:06.355
Well, you guys look like
you need the money
more than we do.

11:06.493 --> 11:07.977
Right.

11:08.115 --> 11:10.704
Hey, it was nice
doing business with you,
Mr. Jefferson.

11:10.842 --> 11:14.846
Yeah. And if you're going
out on the streets tonight,
be careful.

11:14.984 --> 11:16.641
This neighborhood
is a jungle.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.712
You might need this.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.272
A damn water gun!

11:28.411 --> 11:29.619
You wanna go get them?

11:29.758 --> 11:31.276
What are we gonna do,
drown them?

11:31.414 --> 11:34.107
Look, let's just get these
clothes out to the truck
and get out of here.

11:34.245 --> 11:35.522
Right on.

11:36.903 --> 11:37.904
Yeah, right on...

11:40.078 --> 11:41.528
OFFICER: Freeze!
Hey!

11:41.666 --> 11:43.495
Up against the counter.
Move it!

11:44.048 --> 11:45.325
Spread 'em.

11:45.463 --> 11:46.878
Let me explain
it to you.

11:47.016 --> 11:49.536
Look, man,
I own this property.
I'm George Jefferson!

11:49.674 --> 11:51.883
Yeah, sure, bud.
And I'm Kojak.

11:52.021 --> 11:52.988
Wait!

11:53.851 --> 11:55.645
No ID on this one.
This one either.

11:55.784 --> 11:58.372
You know, because...
That's 'cause these two dudes
just stole our wallets.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.651
Oh, come on, man.
Now I know you can do
better than that.

12:01.790 --> 12:04.758
Sure. At least the last
two jerks we caught
were original.

12:04.896 --> 12:06.967
They said they were running
a delivery service.

12:08.072 --> 12:09.452
You're wrong, man.

12:09.590 --> 12:11.972
Yeah, sure we are.
You're under arrest.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.491
You got a right
to remain silent.

12:13.629 --> 12:14.975
If you give up that right
to remain silent,

12:15.113 --> 12:16.563
anything you say
can and will be

12:16.701 --> 12:18.807
held against you
in a court of law.
I wanna see my lawyer!

12:18.945 --> 12:21.671
Come on, buddy, let's go
for a ride downtown.

12:21.810 --> 12:24.605
MARCUS: Will somebody
help us, please? Help us.

12:30.577 --> 12:32.061
What?

12:46.110 --> 12:47.697
Inside.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.907
Hey, I ain't taking this
sitting down, you know.

12:50.045 --> 12:51.149
Then take it standing up.

12:52.944 --> 12:56.499
Sorry about the
accommodations, but all
the private rooms are taken.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.847
I meant the guy
got all that ink
all over my hands.

12:58.985 --> 13:02.574
Oh, what a shame.
The manicurist won't be in
till morning.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.646
Hey! Look, I'm a voter.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.442
I'm a veteran!
I'm a taxpayer!

13:09.098 --> 13:10.306
I wanna see my lawyer.

13:10.928 --> 13:12.619
I wanna see
my lawyer too.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.379
Sit down, nigger.
You ain't got no lawyer.

13:17.866 --> 13:19.695
Okay, then I wanna see
his lawyer.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.180
GEORGE: Hey!
Hey.

13:22.318 --> 13:24.320
Relax, friend.
I ain't your friend.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.426
Oh, come on now,
there ain't no need
to be hostile.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.393
After all, we're gonna be
spending a lot of
time together.

13:28.531 --> 13:31.120
No, we ain't.
I'm leaving as soon as my wife
comes to get me out of here.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.191
You got the
time, Marcus?

13:33.329 --> 13:34.917
Uh, I ain't got a watch.

13:35.055 --> 13:36.194
You wanna buy one?

13:40.716 --> 13:42.925
Hey, man, how'd the cops
miss all of them watches?

13:43.063 --> 13:46.446
Simple. I let them frisk
the same arm twice.

13:46.584 --> 13:50.622
First, like this.
Then, like this.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.176
Man, what time you got?

13:52.314 --> 13:54.903
What city?
This city, chump!

13:55.938 --> 13:57.802
11:30, chump!

13:59.148 --> 14:01.530
You believe this, Marcus?
No.

14:01.668 --> 14:03.394
Well, they ain't getting
away with it.
Who?

14:03.532 --> 14:05.741
Them cops that arrested me,
that's who!

14:05.879 --> 14:07.847
I think they already
got away with it.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.989
Hey, the lights!
All right! Now...

14:12.127 --> 14:14.129
Say, what... What'd they
catch you stealing?

14:14.267 --> 14:17.442
Look, I didn't
steal nothing, man.
See, I own this cleaners.

14:17.580 --> 14:18.616
Uh-huh...

14:20.618 --> 14:22.827
So me and Marcus
was gonna go up
to the store

14:22.965 --> 14:25.002
and get all the clothes out
before the looters got there.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.727
Uh-huh.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.971
But the looters
beat us to it.

14:29.109 --> 14:32.181
And then these two
big guys grabbed us and
took our wallets away.

14:32.319 --> 14:33.734
And one of them
had a gun.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.495
A gun? Oh, wow.

14:37.704 --> 14:41.501
I'm telling you, man.
And then, me and Marcus
get up there,

14:41.639 --> 14:44.366
and we're taking the clothes
out to the truck and
the cops catch us

14:44.504 --> 14:46.989
and arrest us,
'cause they think
we're the looters!

14:47.127 --> 14:50.096
Man, that is
quite a story.
Yeah, I know.

14:50.234 --> 14:52.719
How long did it take
you to think it up?

14:52.857 --> 14:56.861
Look, man, I ain't thought
nothing up. I ain't stole
nothing! I'm innocent.

14:56.999 --> 14:59.622
Hey, we all innocent.
Ain't that right, brothers?

14:59.760 --> 15:01.348
Right.

15:01.486 --> 15:03.247
See, we all been framed.

15:03.385 --> 15:06.284
That's right. I was walking
down the street minding my
own business,

15:06.422 --> 15:08.666
when all of a sudden
this cop comes
and arrests me,

15:08.804 --> 15:11.600
just 'cause I had
a brand new color TV
under my arms.

15:13.222 --> 15:15.155
That's it. I got arrested
for playing baseball.

15:15.293 --> 15:17.157
Baseball?

15:17.295 --> 15:19.401
Yeah, I pitched a couple
of rocks through the front
window of Mars Liquor Store.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.199
See, we all
law abiding citizens.
Just like you. See?

15:24.337 --> 15:26.339
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Hold,
hold, hold. Look, you ain't
nothing like me.

15:26.477 --> 15:27.754
I ain't no thief.
MAN: Oh, man...

15:27.892 --> 15:29.894
That's right.
Hold on, hold on,
I'm talking. Look.

15:30.032 --> 15:32.000
I spent most of my life
building my business,

15:32.138 --> 15:36.142
and what happens? The lights
go out and people like
you all hit the streets,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.523
just grabbing
anything y'all want and
can get your hands on.

15:38.661 --> 15:41.768
You got it. I just
wish my hands were bigger.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.565
You mean to tell me
you don't think

15:45.703 --> 15:46.842
you did nothing wrong?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.741
Yeah, I did something wrong.
I got caught.

15:52.261 --> 15:55.575
I don't understand you.
In fact, I don't understand
none of y'all.

15:55.713 --> 15:57.197
Of course
you don't understand.

15:57.335 --> 15:59.303
Oh, he understands.
He understands.

16:02.409 --> 16:04.929
You gotta lighten up, blood.
We ain't no criminals.

16:05.067 --> 16:07.242
Oh, yeah? Then what
the hell you doing in jail?

16:07.380 --> 16:09.002
What the hell
are you doing in jail?

16:10.383 --> 16:12.212
I'm here by mistake,
not like you.

16:12.350 --> 16:13.420
Uh-huh.

16:14.421 --> 16:16.768
You ever been poor?
Yeah.

16:17.804 --> 16:19.875
I mean, real poor.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.153
Sure.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.053
He was so poor his folks
couldn't even afford
a bigger kid.

16:33.509 --> 16:34.994
Well?

16:35.132 --> 16:37.168
You're damn right I've been
poor. But I didn't go
around looting.

16:37.306 --> 16:39.377
I got me a job.
I got a job, baby.

16:39.515 --> 16:41.172
Oh, yeah? What kind
of job you got?

16:41.310 --> 16:43.623
Trick or treating
color TVs every time
the lights go out?

16:44.624 --> 16:47.075
No, man.
I work at a car wash.

16:47.213 --> 16:48.352
MAN: Yeah?

16:48.490 --> 16:50.561
Hey, I got a watch
here that's waterproof.

16:52.149 --> 16:54.427
Gold band, digital.

16:54.565 --> 16:57.292
Hey, okay, okay.
Forget it.

16:59.190 --> 17:01.917
If you got a job, what you
doing out there looting?

17:02.055 --> 17:06.784
You try feeding a family
of five on what you
can make at a car wash.

17:06.922 --> 17:10.236
Let me
tell you Jeffer Joe,
you do not eat too fancy.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.618
So in order to
put some food on my table,

17:13.756 --> 17:15.931
I busted into
an appliance store.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.279
Appliance store?
What did you plan on doing?
Feeding your family blenders?

17:22.075 --> 17:23.732
No, man.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.804
I was gonna
sell them for bread,
you know. Real bread.

17:26.942 --> 17:28.219
Oh, man,
that ain't no excuse.

17:28.909 --> 17:30.532
It beats starving.

17:30.670 --> 17:33.776
Sometimes you gotta
do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.330
Right?
ALL: Yeah, man...

17:35.468 --> 17:38.367
Oh, so in other words,
you're telling me

17:38.505 --> 17:41.025
that everybody that's
out there looting is doing it
to keep from starving?

17:41.163 --> 17:43.717
No, man. Now some of
them dudes are out there

17:43.855 --> 17:45.305
looting just for the hell
of it, you know.

17:45.443 --> 17:47.652
They're the kind that give
looters a bad name.

17:50.207 --> 17:51.415
OFFICER: George Jefferson.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.175
Yes!

17:53.900 --> 17:56.109
Hey, Weezy!
Miss Jefferson.

17:56.247 --> 17:57.490
MAN: Hey, mama.

17:57.628 --> 17:58.836
Hey, watch it.
Uh-huh.

17:59.423 --> 18:00.562
Is this your husband?

18:01.701 --> 18:04.428
Oh, yeah, that's him.
Baby Face Jefferson.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.430
Funny, Weez.

18:06.568 --> 18:10.261
All right, come on,
you two.
What took you so long?

18:10.399 --> 18:14.645
George, I had to walk
down 12 flights of stairs
in the dark!

18:14.783 --> 18:16.716
Hey, you wanna buy
a watch with
a lighted dial?

18:19.546 --> 18:21.721
Sorry about the mistake,
Mr. Jefferson.

18:21.859 --> 18:25.380
Oh, yeah? You're gonna be
even sorrier when you hear
from my lawyer.

18:25.518 --> 18:29.763
From the way
I understand it, it was
a very innocent mistake.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.627
Oh, maybe she's right,
Mr. Jefferson.

18:31.765 --> 18:33.664
I guess it could have
happened to anybody.

18:33.802 --> 18:37.150
Anybody who was dumb enough
to roam around during
a blackout.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.773
Oh, Weezy.
Come on, George,
it's late.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.569
Yeah, that's right. I gotta
get up early and get
up to the Bronx store.

18:42.707 --> 18:44.226
I'll go with you
and help you clean it up.

18:44.364 --> 18:45.745
No, I ain't gonna
clean it up.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.160
You're not?

18:47.298 --> 18:49.128
I'm gonna close it up.
MARCUS: What?

18:51.095 --> 18:53.339
ALL: Bye, Weezy.

18:55.064 --> 18:56.480
Hey, come on,
what's wrong with you?

19:03.763 --> 19:04.971
Come on...

19:05.765 --> 19:08.250
Who? Me?

19:08.388 --> 19:11.150
Say, man, let me...
Let me tell you
what happened, man.

19:12.565 --> 19:15.395
Oh, my, my, my...

19:15.533 --> 19:17.880
Hey, hey, wait a minute, man.
My mama gave me
these watches.

19:27.752 --> 19:29.789
Oh, George,

19:30.548 --> 19:32.171
what a shame.

19:32.309 --> 19:34.897
Looks like this place had
a close encounter
of the tenth kind.

19:36.002 --> 19:37.866
They took everything.

19:38.004 --> 19:40.731
Well, you heard
what the cops said.

19:40.869 --> 19:43.665
You gotta put up steel
plated walls and iron bars
to keep them out.

19:45.701 --> 19:47.600
George, look at this.

19:49.429 --> 19:52.087
Oh, yeah, that's
the first dollar this store
ever made.

19:52.846 --> 19:54.986
That was six years ago.

19:55.124 --> 19:57.230
I remember how happy you
were when you brought this

19:57.368 --> 20:00.164
dollar home and asked me
to get a frame for it.

20:00.302 --> 20:02.477
Yeah. I'm surprised the
looters didn't take that.

20:03.063 --> 20:04.133
Hmm.

20:04.651 --> 20:05.721
Hi.

20:06.308 --> 20:07.309
What do you want?

20:07.447 --> 20:08.690
Are you George Jefferson?

20:08.828 --> 20:10.278
Yeah, but it ain't
gonna do you no good,
we're closed.

20:10.416 --> 20:13.212
Oh, is this your wallet?
What?

20:13.350 --> 20:16.456
It is your wallet, George.
Where did you get it?

20:16.594 --> 20:18.631
I found it in the
alley around the corner.

20:18.769 --> 20:20.288
Anything left in it?

20:20.426 --> 20:22.013
Just a picture
of your mother.

20:22.151 --> 20:23.843
They took
everything of value.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.711
Well, look, thanks for
bringing the wallet back.

20:29.849 --> 20:32.231
Hey, no, I don't want
your bread, man.

20:32.369 --> 20:35.441
What'd you bring
the wallet back for?
'Cause it's yours.

20:35.579 --> 20:37.063
You live around here?

20:37.201 --> 20:40.031
No, I dress this way
because I'm an eccentric
millionaire.

20:40.169 --> 20:43.242
Oh. Well, how come you
didn't put that with
the rest of the loot?

20:43.380 --> 20:46.417
George, not everybody
around here was out looting.

20:46.555 --> 20:49.903
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Some people had to stay
home and hide the stuff.

20:53.079 --> 20:54.908
They really did a job
on you, huh?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.289
Yeah, they ruined
my store.

20:56.427 --> 20:58.429
I wasn't talking
about your store.
What?

20:59.361 --> 21:01.225
I'm talking about
your head, man.

21:03.158 --> 21:05.574
I guess you're gonna
close this place down
for good now, huh?

21:05.712 --> 21:07.093
You're damn right I am.

21:07.231 --> 21:09.544
George, anger doesn't
solve anything.

21:09.682 --> 21:11.649
I ain't angry! I'm mad!

21:13.306 --> 21:14.859
You're really gonna
close down the store?

21:14.997 --> 21:16.965
That's the only
thing to do, lady.
See?

21:17.103 --> 21:19.795
I mean, it's obvious that
everyone in this area
is a crook.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.072
Right.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.936
Why even the people
who worked here.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.421
No, they ain't no crooks.

21:24.559 --> 21:25.560
No.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.114
They're just
unemployed, huh?

21:28.252 --> 21:29.460
No, they ain't un...

21:30.392 --> 21:32.325
Look, I'm sure
I'm not the only

21:32.463 --> 21:35.501
store owner
who's had enough
and who's gonna quit.

21:35.639 --> 21:38.711
But, George, this store's
done a good business.

21:38.849 --> 21:41.714
You've got regular customers
who depend on you.

21:41.852 --> 21:45.407
Closing down just because of
what happened last night
is like throwing

21:45.545 --> 21:47.271
the baby out
with the bath water.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.412
What's this got to do
with babies taking baths?

21:52.794 --> 21:54.313
Your man's right, lady.

21:54.451 --> 21:57.523
I mean, what's the
point of providing
employment down here?

21:57.661 --> 22:00.319
What's the point of
trying to help a community
get back on its feet?

22:02.873 --> 22:04.323
I can't hang around here.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.912
I gotta find myself
a new cleaners.

22:08.050 --> 22:10.225
I think there's one
about 20 blocks
up from here.

22:10.915 --> 22:12.054
Hey, hey, wait.

22:13.055 --> 22:14.643
Look, you
ain't gotta do that.

22:16.576 --> 22:20.097
There's one right here.
Just bring your clothes
in tomorrow. It'll be on me.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.790
Jefferson,
you're all right.

22:27.829 --> 22:30.072
You are not gonna
close down?

22:30.210 --> 22:31.729
Weezy, now why would I
do a stupid thing
like that?

22:31.867 --> 22:33.628
I mean, you gotta have
faith in people.

22:33.766 --> 22:35.077
But...

22:35.215 --> 22:36.458
Weezy, just because a few
people do something wrong,

22:36.596 --> 22:38.357
you ain't gotta
punish everybody.

22:38.495 --> 22:39.910
But that's what I...

22:40.048 --> 22:43.672
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy,
you got to learn
to trust people.

22:45.674 --> 22:49.091
Oh, George, I love you.

22:49.229 --> 22:53.544
Now, I wonder how much
it's gonna cost for steel
plated walls and iron bars?

23:05.625 --> 23:06.592
Oh!

23:08.110 --> 23:09.871
Well, that's it.
Everything's back
where it was.

23:10.527 --> 23:12.460
Hey, Weez,

23:12.598 --> 23:14.220
did you move
all that furniture
by yourself?

23:14.358 --> 23:16.256
Yes. And it wasn't easy.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.949
Look, if you needed
somebody with muscles,
why didn't you call me?

23:19.846 --> 23:21.607
Why? You know somebody
with muscles?

23:23.954 --> 23:25.887
For your information,
when I was in the Navy,

23:26.025 --> 23:28.510
I used
to go into the weight
lifting room every day.

23:28.648 --> 23:31.168
You must have felt right
at home, with all those
dumbbells.

23:33.239 --> 23:35.724
Yeah, just like now,
except I can't lift you.

23:38.037 --> 23:40.280
George, what have
you got in the bag?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.179
Just a few things
in case we have
another blackout.

23:43.111 --> 23:46.217
Candles, a flashlight...
Earphones?

23:46.355 --> 23:49.013
No, no, no, no.
They ain't earphones, Weezy.
It's a radio.

23:49.151 --> 23:51.084
So I can listen to the news
without having to listen
to you and Florence

23:51.222 --> 23:52.914
in case you start that
dumb singing again.

23:53.052 --> 23:54.363
George...
See?

23:54.502 --> 23:55.986
You just turn it on,

23:56.124 --> 23:58.022
and you can't hear nothing
you don't wanna hear.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.268
Uh, George...
Can't hear you, Weezy.

24:03.718 --> 24:04.719
Let me try it.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.829
Hey...
That sounds great.

24:13.348 --> 24:16.972
Oh, by the way, the Willises
will be down soon.
The Willises?

24:17.110 --> 24:18.905
Yeah. They're coming
here for dinner.

24:19.043 --> 24:20.424
What are they
coming down here for?

24:20.562 --> 24:22.184
Because you won't
go up there.

24:22.322 --> 24:23.738
Of all the dumb reasons.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.464
Hey, wait a minute.
Now listen to me.
Hey, look...

24:25.602 --> 24:27.224
Weezy...
I can't hear you, George.

24:53.284 --> 24:56.943
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
