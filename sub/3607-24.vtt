00:02.001 --> 00:03.044
Previously on Lost:

00:03.128 --> 00:05.213
We're not the only people
on this island,

00:05.297 --> 00:07.215
and we all know it!

00:07.299 --> 00:08.716
They've attacked us!

00:08.801 --> 00:11.886
Sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.556
Maybe it's time we started
worrying about them!

00:17.476 --> 00:20.478
Danielle? What are you doing here?

00:20.562 --> 00:22.313
When I saw black smoke,

00:22.398 --> 00:25.441
that night, they came.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.404
You have only three choices.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.614
Run.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.033
Hide.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.576
Or die.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.162
All I can tell you now
is we do have a plan.

00:38.247 --> 00:42.041
Yeah. Go in the jungle, and get
dynamite and blow open a hatch,

00:42.126 --> 00:44.043
and then hide everyone inside.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.379
God knows how long
that dynamite has been out there.

00:46.463 --> 00:51.759
So unless you want to blow up,
I'm coming with you.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.056
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

00:57.933 --> 01:01.561
- See you soon.
- Yes, you will.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.620
Hey, keep it straight.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.540
Go, go!

01:22.624 --> 01:24.834
Bye, Vincent.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.900
Claire. Everybody's leaving.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.860
Well, I can't go anywhere, all right?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.237
I've got the baby and I'm so tired.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.406
I can't... can't carry him.

01:55.491 --> 01:58.242
And now he's wet
and there's sand everywhere.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.287
- I don't have anymore nappies.
- Why don't you let me help?

02:01.371 --> 02:04.290
No, look, nobody ever taught me
how to do this. OK?

02:04.374 --> 02:07.293
- It's gonna be OK.
- Why do people keep telling me that?

02:07.377 --> 02:09.044
Are they the ones with the baby?

02:10.756 --> 02:12.715
We've got to get there before sundown.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.176
Once you reach the caves, stay there.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.804
The rest of us will be right behind you.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.972
Sayid.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.059
I need a gun.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.645
I know Jack gave 'em to you.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.314
I want one right now.
I have to protect Claire.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.817
Rousseau said the others
won't be here till night.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.319
She's certifiable.
What if they show up before?

02:33.403 --> 02:36.739
- Last time you had a sidearm...
- I killed a murderer. I did us a favor.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.742
You're emotionally involved.
Let me handle the weapons.

02:39.827 --> 02:43.079
You're not here all the time.
You can't protect her. I need a gun.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.749
If you want to help Claire, get her
packed, carry her child to the caves.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.000
That's what she needs.

03:14.486 --> 03:18.447
How exactly does something
like this happen?

03:18.949 --> 03:21.117
Are you on the same island as I am?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.331
I guess that explains it.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.167
Hold on, wait... Hold, wait.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.044
What are we, a couple miles inland?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.630
A tsunami probably swept it here. Right?

03:37.426 --> 03:38.843
Hey, where are you going?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.220
The explosives are
in the hold of the ship.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.889
Rousseau, wait.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.978
I did what you asked.
You need dynamite.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.605
You don't need me.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.482
Let her go, Jack.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.069
Who's gonna lead us back?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.821
I'll lead us back.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.828
Damn it.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.666
You heard her.
Explosives are in the hold. Let's go.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.003
Hold on. I came here to tell you
how to handle dynamite,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.088
not explore a ghost ship.
You think...

04:16.173 --> 04:18.132
Just... stay out here.

04:23.305 --> 04:27.016
I'm gonna stay out here
and hang with Arnzt.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.586
Slaves.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.765
This ship must have been
en route to a mining colony.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.352
Probably set off from
the eastern coast of Africa.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.979
Mozambique.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.229
Jack. John. Over here.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.740
...and then my third wife,
she says, get this,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.450
"I didn't sign up for this."

06:49.534 --> 06:52.411
You tell me, what the hell
is that even supposed to mean?

06:54.623 --> 06:56.540
What, am I boring you?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.797
You know what? I'm sorry.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.716
I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough
to be part of your

07:05.801 --> 07:08.594
merry little band of adventurers.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.762
What?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.681
I know a clique when I see it.
I teach high school, pally!

07:14.017 --> 07:15.810
You know, you people think

07:15.894 --> 07:19.021
you're the only ones on
this island doing anything of value.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.689
I got news for you.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.609
There were 40 other survivors
of this plane crash,

07:23.693 --> 07:26.362
and we are all people too.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.950
OK.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.701
You know what,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.787
I can probably get it open if I just...

07:34.871 --> 07:36.413
No. We should take it outside.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.457
Why? You don't even know if this...

07:38.542 --> 07:41.919
You're not prying open a crate
that says "Explosives" with a pickax.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.046
Yeah, I agree with Jack.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.257
Take it outside, open it there.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.926
OK.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.470
I got it.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.972
You mind showing us the way?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.729
It's not just the teenagers either.
The gym teachers,

08:00.814 --> 08:04.316
you think they let me sit with them
in the cafeteria? No. They do not.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.818
This is all in your head.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.653
Really? You explain to me why Kate

08:07.737 --> 08:10.281
gets the best pieces
of wreckage for her shelter?

08:10.365 --> 08:13.701
And the Korean guy. Does he catch
fish for everybody on the island?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.661
No. He does not. He doesn't.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.166
And some of us have actually
lost weight while we were here.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.835
You mind telling me
where you're hiding the carbs?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.420
'Cause I can't figure...

08:25.088 --> 08:27.089
What the hell are you people doing?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.135
Wait, wait. Stop.
Stop right where you are.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.636
Put that down carefully.
Put it down carefully.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.432
Put it gently...
Gently. Damn it!

08:36.515 --> 08:39.351
Carefully, gently. Gently.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.522
Get outta there.
Get away from it. Come on.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.859
- Get out. Move away from it.
- What the hell is your...?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.277
Be quiet.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.532
Do any of you have any idea

08:53.617 --> 08:58.120
what happens to dynamite
in 90-plus degree heat?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.789
Do you know?

09:02.626 --> 09:03.626
Any of you?

09:06.463 --> 09:09.965
It sweats nitroglycerin.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.346
What are you doing?
Did I ask you to come closer?

09:24.356 --> 09:25.731
Dynamite...

09:26.483 --> 09:29.443
...is nitroglycerine stabilized by clay.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.614
Nitroglycerine...

09:34.991 --> 09:39.662
...is the most dangerous and unstable
explosive known to man.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.624
Hey Kate, gimme your shirt.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.504
Now. Princess, give me your shirt.
I need to wrap the dynamite.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.714
Just throw it to me, right here.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.549
Just be careful.
Come on, hurry up.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.010
OK, good. Now back up.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.596
Back up. Just back up.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.056
Get outta my way.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.517
Any of you ever hear

10:01.601 --> 10:04.061
about the guy
who invented nitroglycerin?

10:04.145 --> 10:05.938
Probably not,

10:06.022 --> 10:09.108
because he blew
his freaking face off.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.487
His lab assistant
came into the room,

10:14.197 --> 10:16.740
saw that his mentor had detonated,

10:17.534 --> 10:19.576
and he said:

10:20.370 --> 10:22.663
"I guess this stuff does work."

10:26.835 --> 10:29.503
We're not gonna take
more of this stuff than we need,

10:29.587 --> 10:32.381
because nitroglycerine
is extremely temperamental.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.465
So we just...

10:42.976 --> 10:44.101
Dude.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.966
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- I'm sure you are.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.926
Sir, your bag was unattended.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.387
- Am I free to go?
- Yes, sir.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.680
Good.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.807
I have a plane to catch.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.568
Could you hand me a
paper towel there, bud?

11:35.570 --> 11:37.780
Paper towel, this one's broken.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.619
You don't speak English. Sorry.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.753
Dad, look!

13:25.638 --> 13:28.223
How does a place this big
never get discovered?

13:29.893 --> 13:31.185
Don't know.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.147
But you could build yourself one hell
of a beach resort right over there.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.858
Yeah, you build your resort.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.360
I'm happy to say goodbye
to this place forever.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.992
What about everybody else?
Think they'll be OK?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.995
I hope so, buddy.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.289
At least until we can get 'em some help.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.215
Singing Bob Marley?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.425
No.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.678
Why? You like Bob Marley?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.722
Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?

15:00.191 --> 15:01.608
Damn it!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.361
Do you really need all that?

15:04.445 --> 15:05.737
Yeah. I do.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.781
Why do you have to bring so much?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.533
Don't you have a hike to lead?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.872
I'm fine.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.875
These belonged to your brother.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.882
I need these things.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.678
I can't just leave them.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.559
What are we doing?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.685
Hiding?

15:37.145 --> 15:38.854
As if they won't find us.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.731
It's just...

15:42.525 --> 15:46.069
It's too much.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.825
It won't be too much
if I carry it for you.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.039
Now come on.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.875
I have a hike to lead.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.347
You OK?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.060
That was messed up.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.729
Yeah.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.398
He just...

16:25.610 --> 16:27.569
...exploded...

16:28.279 --> 16:30.238
...in front of us.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.576
He was just trying to help.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.166
This is because I came.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.919
What?

16:46.297 --> 16:47.714
I'm...

16:48.966 --> 16:51.885
...kind of bad luck.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.931
Hey...

16:59.435 --> 17:00.977
It was an accident.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.275
An accident.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.528
Yeah.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.638
We should think about this.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.932
All right.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.976
Maybe this isn't the best way.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.229
It's the only way, Jack.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.519
- How many do we need to blow the hatch?
- Two should take care of the hinge.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.148
- Three to be safe.
- Safe.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.363
I'm removing the driest pieces
to minimize our risk transporting it.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.412
You ever play Operation?

18:45.792 --> 18:48.376
Sure. "Don't touch the sides."

18:50.004 --> 18:51.338
I...

18:51.881 --> 18:53.465
I always...

18:54.550 --> 18:56.468
...got nailed...

18:57.595 --> 18:59.888
...on the funny bone.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.569
You like to play games, John?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.114
Absolutely.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.496
OK.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.998
I know we're in a rush
to escape to the caves,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.584
so I've solved the
Turnip-Head transport issue.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.255
This is just a blanket
from the plane.

19:33.339 --> 19:37.592
And then, this piece of wood here
that goes through this bamboo.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.427
Here you go.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.263
It's a Björn.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.432
- A Björn?
- Björn.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.895
It's Dutch for baby carrier.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.522
Yeah. Thanks.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.440
- Well, that's OK.
- Thank you.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.568
- Thanks.
- That's OK.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.194
Let's put him in there.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.571
- It's really...
- Sayid!

19:57.655 --> 19:58.864
- Where is he?
- What...?

20:00.074 --> 20:02.492
- Sayid, where is he?
- He already left.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.119
- I need him now!
- Jack and Kate?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.871
There's no time!
Where is Sayid?

20:05.955 --> 20:08.623
All right, just calm down.
I'll get him for you.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.042
- Stay here, all right?
- OK.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.127
That's OK.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.087
Sayid!

20:16.382 --> 20:17.757
What happened out there?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.638
What is his name?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.432
Your child.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.893
What is his name?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.312
Oh, I haven't named him yet.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.108
May I hold him?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.612
Why do you need Sayid?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.282
You don't want me to hold him?

20:43.075 --> 20:46.369
No, I just fed him.
I don't think it's a good idea. OK?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.872
Please!

21:02.845 --> 21:04.721
When did I do that?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.682
Why did I scratch you?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.840
What's going on?

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
My flight.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.139
My flight to LA
leaves in a couple of hours,

21:48.224 --> 21:50.892
so you gotta get moving, you know?

21:54.522 --> 21:57.023
You wanna do one more bump
for the road?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.317
It's all gone.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.820
We did it all last night.
I got some champagne.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.614
You gotta have some left.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.326
Nope. It's done.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.745
I'll look you up next time
I'm in Sydney, OK.

22:10.913 --> 22:15.166
I'll send you an
autographed copy of my CD,

22:15.251 --> 22:16.835
then you can listen when you want.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.838
I don't want your crap CD
from your crap band.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.215
Last night in the bar,
you said you were a fan.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.719
Fine. I'm a huge fan.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.721
Drive Thru is the
best damn band ever.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.100
Now just gimme a bump,
'cause I know you got some.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.021
Shaft. Drive Shaft.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.649
What's that in your hand?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.610
Nothing.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.031
- Holding out on me?
- I'm not holding out.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.198
- Give it to me.
- What?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.867
- I'm not holding.
- Give it.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.244
I got nothing in my hand!
Get off!

22:52.580 --> 22:53.621
Get up!

22:53.748 --> 22:56.458
- Get off!
- Get up! Let it go. Let it go!

22:56.542 --> 22:58.168
- What are you, crazy?
- Let it go!

22:58.252 --> 23:00.462
- Get off!
- Let it go!

23:00.755 --> 23:03.089
Get off! Get off me!

23:12.600 --> 23:13.725
You're pathetic.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.561
You're pathetic!

23:27.782 --> 23:29.616
Sayid! Sayid!

23:31.744 --> 23:33.787
Rousseau's on the beach.
She needs you.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.081
- Rousseau? What for?
- I don't know.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.541
Help! Help!

23:39.085 --> 23:41.336
Help! Someone! Help!

23:41.420 --> 23:42.962
- Oh, my God.
- Help!

23:43.047 --> 23:44.047
What happened?

23:44.131 --> 23:45.131
Her head.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.093
- Where's my baby?
- Oh, my God.

23:48.803 --> 23:49.844
Is he all right?

23:50.179 --> 23:52.722
- Rousseau. Was she alone?
- Did she take my baby?

23:52.807 --> 23:53.932
Did she take my baby?

23:54.016 --> 23:55.225
Which way did she go?

23:55.309 --> 23:58.645
I don't know!
She took my baby!

23:59.355 --> 24:01.898
This is your fault!
You brought her into the camp!

24:01.982 --> 24:03.149
If you had given me a gun...

24:04.360 --> 24:05.860
Do not hit me again.

24:06.821 --> 24:09.030
You want to waste time assigning blame?

24:09.115 --> 24:10.865
There's plenty to go around.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.160
She has a head start.
If we leave now, we can catch her.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.578
How we gonna do that?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.580
Because I know where she's going.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.751
- Please now...
- I want my baby.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.470
I can carry all the sticks in my pack.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.348
The more insulation we stuff in,
the better.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.476
I think we should split 'em up.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.228
What?

24:40.312 --> 24:43.481
It's not smart to keep it all together,
so we split 'em up.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.692
If we need three sticks
to blow the hinge,

24:45.776 --> 24:47.110
then we should bring six.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.570
Three and three.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.407
A fail-safe. In case one of us...

24:53.492 --> 24:54.576
You and me then.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.620
No. I'm taking one.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.623
Not gonna happen.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.833
This is why I came.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.960
- You wasted a trip.
- I need to do this.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.588
Kate, no one owes anyone anything.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.339
- I'm carrying one.
- We're done.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.175
- This is not your decision.
- It is.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.718
We'll draw straws.

25:12.803 --> 25:17.432
They're coming. We don't have time to
argue about who risks their life, so...

25:18.142 --> 25:20.768
- ...we let fate decide.
- Works for me.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.275
What about you?
You wanna carry some dynamite?

25:29.778 --> 25:30.778
What?

25:31.947 --> 25:35.783
You got some Arnzt on you.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.125
Short sticks carry the packs.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.558
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.071
So, what's this stuff even do?

26:13.155 --> 26:15.865
Well, the transmitter
sends out an SOS

26:15.950 --> 26:17.659
in case someone's listening.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.245
And if there's anything out there,

26:20.329 --> 26:22.580
we'll see it on this radar screen here.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.671
Here we go.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.676
Come on.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.220
Someone, find us.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.020
Those are messages everybody wrote.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.855
Sure are.

26:47.940 --> 26:48.982
They're private.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.276
Yep.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.862
I for one never knew how much Tracey

26:54.947 --> 26:57.532
missed her hubby
and two kids back in Fresno.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.743
Yet she's sleeping
next to good ol' Scott

27:00.828 --> 27:02.328
to keep her warm at night.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.539
That's Steve. Scott's dead.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.082
Whatever.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.377
Long ride, Kazoo.
We gotta keep ourselves entertained.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.171
Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got

27:12.256 --> 27:15.049
a hundred and sixty million dollars
to leave to his mom?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.051
How'd you like it if I read yours?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.762
You can't 'cause I didn't write one.

27:20.973 --> 27:21.973
Why not?

27:22.057 --> 27:25.727
'Cause the only letter I ever wrote
is to the man I'm gonna kill.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.230
- Why you gonna kill him?
- 'Cause I need to.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.442
- Why?
- Because.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.327
Are you bloody joking?

27:42.411 --> 27:45.830
Why would she go for the black smoke?
Isn't that where the others are?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.999
The others are why she would go there.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.251
Rousseau told us
she saw black smoke

27:50.336 --> 27:52.754
the day her own child
was taken 16 years ago.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.798
They took something from her.

27:55.883 --> 27:59.844
And now she believes...
she has something they want.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.473
- She's making a trade?
- I believe she is. Yes.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.683
That's insane. She's insane.

28:05.768 --> 28:09.520
Don't apply reason to her actions.
She's a mother who lost her child.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.646
Just like Claire.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.985
This isn't about revenge.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.945
Don't make it personal.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.661
I'm coming with you.

28:25.746 --> 28:26.996
That's not a good idea.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.665
This is my baby, OK. I let her take him.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.377
- Claire, listen.
- Don't tell me what to do!

28:32.461 --> 28:33.544
Calm down.

28:33.629 --> 28:36.631
I am coming with you.
This is my fault and I'm coming

28:36.715 --> 28:37.924
and you can't stop me!

28:38.258 --> 28:40.676
It's fine, all right. It's all right.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.678
I'm supposed to raise him.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.729
Get him back, Charlie.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.858
Get Aaron back.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.485
Aaron?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.862
Please.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.447
Get him back. Please.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.867
Claire, I will get him back.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.160
Promise.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.641
Hey, you want something to eat?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.065
I guess that's a "no" then.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.369
If you're worried about Vincent,
he's gonna be OK, man.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.372
Dogs fly in the luggage compartment
all the time.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.587
All right.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.840
I gotta call work.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.925
Right over there.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.553
Don't go anywhere, OK?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.770
No, I live in a studio apartment.

30:14.855 --> 30:17.815
I gotta be out the door
in the morning for work by 5am.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.319
Who's gonna watch him? How's he
getting to school? What about after?

30:21.403 --> 30:23.488
I can't do this, Ma.

30:25.908 --> 30:26.949
You know, I was...

30:28.744 --> 30:30.495
Listen, I was thinking...

30:33.290 --> 30:35.416
I was thinking maybe
you could take him.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.504
But Ma,
if it's a question of money, I...

30:46.094 --> 30:49.430
What am I supposed to do with him?
He's not supposed to be mine.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.766
This was never part of the plan.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.607
Yeah, I...

31:01.610 --> 31:03.069
Thanks, Ma.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.750
Hey, man.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.295
- I was...
- I need new batteries.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.265
- You wanna try?
- What?

31:32.349 --> 31:33.349
Come on, come here.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.726
- You drive for awhile.
- Really?

31:35.811 --> 31:38.229
Absolutely.
OK, now. Look.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.898
The most important part
of this boat is the rudder.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.316
It's how you steer.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.236
You turn it gradually.
Nothing sharp, OK?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.737
Push it this way.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.492
Where are we going?

31:52.619 --> 31:53.661
Look.

31:54.121 --> 31:57.248
So we're going approximately
north by northeast.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.084
So hopefully that puts us
into a shipping lane.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.420
Or we hit some land.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.131
What do I aim for?

32:06.174 --> 32:07.925
See that cloud on the horizon?

32:08.010 --> 32:09.468
- Right there?
- Yeah.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.430
You aim for that.

32:12.973 --> 32:13.931
Yep.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.725
- OK.
- Got it.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.691
How come you and my mom
didn't stay together?

32:27.112 --> 32:28.404
We tried.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.782
It just didn't work out.
So our lives, our interests

32:32.826 --> 32:35.161
just went in different directions.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.497
How come I never saw you?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.545
'Cause your mom didn't want me to.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.507
She did what she thought was best.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.762
She was wrong.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.394
- Rudder.
- Hey, we hit a log.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.897
- We lost the rudder.
- Rudder. Rudder.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.566
We're losing it! It's sinking!
Stop the boat.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.153
Stop the boat!
Just pull the sail down.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.030
Right.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.659
Dad!

33:16.745 --> 33:17.995
Sawyer!

33:23.418 --> 33:25.294
Give me the rope. Throw it.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.392
- Sawyer!
- It's sinking.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.315
I can't reach it.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.283
Got it?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.787
Tie it around the rudder
and we'll pull you in!

34:06.169 --> 34:07.169
OK.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.804
Michael. Michael.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.098
Got it. Come on.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.893
Come on, buddy.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.569
You just saved our ass, buddy.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.496
Here's your shirt.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.498
You should put that
back on before you burn.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.307
Sorry.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.225
Yeah, well...

35:04.436 --> 35:06.103
It's the luck of the draw.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.106
Sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.859
If we want to get back
to the hatch, we have to hustle.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.069
OK, this is how we do this.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.614
I'll lead.
Kate, you're right behind me.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.116
Then Hurley.
John, you bring up the rear.

35:19.201 --> 35:22.870
- If you see me heading the wrong way...
- We should stagger our formation.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.830
Keep a safe distance from each other.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.958
All right. We stagger.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.795
If anyone hears
anything or sees anything...

35:30.879 --> 35:33.506
Like the security system
that eats people?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.883
Yeah. Like that.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.053
You two, you take your packs off,
you put 'em down and you run.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.971
- You got it?
- Got it.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.223
Yes, sir.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.893
OK.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.645
Let's do this.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.614
He died bravely.

36:42.492 --> 36:43.617
What?

36:47.622 --> 36:49.123
Your brother.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.834
Yeah.

36:53.795 --> 36:54.837
Thanks.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.177
Do you think all this...

37:03.889 --> 37:06.015
...all we've been through...?

37:08.018 --> 37:10.561
Do you think we're being punished?

37:12.480 --> 37:13.856
Punished for what?

37:16.526 --> 37:18.444
Things we did before.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.698
The secrets we kept.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.077
The lies we told.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.375
Who do you think is punishing us?

37:37.631 --> 37:39.298
Fate.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.345
No one's punishing us.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.350
No such thing as fate.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.569
Are you OK?

38:00.654 --> 38:01.904
I'm fine. Keep going.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.207
We're losing the light.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.042
- Try to keep up.
- I'm coming.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.063
Sayid!

38:45.490 --> 38:46.490
Over here.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.536
Sayid.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.831
You can barely breathe.
We're going to rest.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.582
Rest?
She's out there right now.

38:55.667 --> 38:59.420
In another mile, you're going to
collapse. We're going to take a break.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.386
Is this where Boone fell?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.096
The plane was up there.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.308
Where did it come from?

39:13.435 --> 39:15.894
Based on the maps inside, Nigeria.

39:18.690 --> 39:22.693
- Anyone on board?
- Two men, dressed as priests.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.446
- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.575
The plane was loaded with heroin.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.209
All right.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.672
Now we go.

40:40.522 --> 40:44.942
So, dude, what do you think's
inside that hatch thing?

40:45.985 --> 40:47.986
What do you think's inside it?

40:49.155 --> 40:51.156
Stacks of TV dinners

40:51.241 --> 40:53.283
from the fifties or something.

40:53.827 --> 40:56.578
And TVs with cable.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.372
Some cell phones.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.375
Clean socks. Soap.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.085
Twinkies.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.130
You know,
for dessert after the TV dinners.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.049
Twinkies keep for,
like, 8,000 years, man.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.970
I like Twinkies too.

41:14.556 --> 41:16.890
Come on, really.
What do you think's inside?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.310
Hope.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.355
I think hope's inside.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.685
Whoever named this place Dark Territory,

42:01.769 --> 42:03.562
genius.
