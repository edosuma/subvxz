WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.803
So my shrink says
to let go

00:02.803 --> 00:03.804
and just accept...

00:03.804 --> 00:07.474
that paradise
has arrived
at my doorstep.

00:07.474 --> 00:09.276
You know, if this
is my Victoria
Secret order

00:09.276 --> 00:10.911
they have a
whole new way
of delivering.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.813
Ladies, Ladies,
shoulders high.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.047
Chest out.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.618
And get ready
to be Morganized.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.353
Uh, why is
our living
room filled

00:19.353 --> 00:20.787
with amazons
in acrylics?

00:20.787 --> 00:22.623
It's for my fashion design
class.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.492
The final is going to be
a spectacular fashion show

00:25.492 --> 00:27.361
featuring the students'
creations.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.063
Designers from all
over the world will be there.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.665
Hey, maybe if you play
your cards right

00:31.665 --> 00:33.166
you'll get
to meet Stella McCartney

00:33.166 --> 00:34.334
and get me Paul's autograph.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.836
If all goes
according
to plan

00:35.836 --> 00:38.238
and none of my
models trip on
the catwalk--

00:38.238 --> 00:39.606
big hint--

00:39.606 --> 00:42.142
the McCartneys
will be asking
for <i>my</i> autograph.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.545
Morgan, I know
how much this
show means to you

00:44.545 --> 00:46.513
and if it
would help, I,
former dancer

00:46.513 --> 00:47.781
would be more
than happy

00:47.781 --> 00:50.250
to teach these
models how to
strut their stuff.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.685
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:51.685 --> 00:53.453
Thanks a lot.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.321
Now I have to redo

00:54.321 --> 00:55.522
Helga.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.690
Let's go
upstairs...

00:56.690 --> 00:58.725
where I can get
some work done.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.761
Boy, I bet any girl would kill

01:00.761 --> 01:01.862
to look like that.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.863
Please.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.331
What do they have
that I don't?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.433
Ten feet of legs.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.601
Hmm.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.737
I wouldn't mind ten feet
of legs.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.242
Oh. If I didn't have
an eight foot ceiling.

01:18.145 --> 01:24.518
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:24.518 --> 01:30.757
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:30.757 --> 01:34.328
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:34.328 --> 01:37.998
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:40.500 --> 01:43.971
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:43.971 --> 01:47.841
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:54.448 --> 01:56.249
My models are
getting tired
of black coffee

01:56.249 --> 01:57.684
and chicken broth,
so I told them

01:57.684 --> 02:00.854
you'd whip up three
of your fat-free lattes.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.923
Right. 'Cause this
bunch really needs

02:02.923 --> 02:03.991
to count calories.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.258
Trust me, ladies.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.427
These are going
to taste just like
the real thing.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.562
Ladies.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.736
Excellent, ladies.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.404
Now I'd like
to get a second take.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.905
Yeah, I bet you would.

02:18.905 --> 02:19.973
Standing.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.575
I want a copy

02:21.575 --> 02:22.876
of all the
takes you shoot

02:22.876 --> 02:23.877
including bloopers.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.946
Goodman, how did you
land this dream job?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.648
I realized
that Morgan's fashion show

02:27.648 --> 02:29.182
would make a brilliant
documentary.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.585
And she bought
that pitch?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.688
Aunt Hilda, can I ask you
a strange question?

02:34.688 --> 02:35.255
Sure.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.256
Have you ever felt like

02:36.256 --> 02:37.391
someone was following you?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.525
No.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.193
I just have this eerie feeling

02:40.193 --> 02:42.362
that wherever I go,
someone is watching me.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.363
Trust me, Sabrina.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.298
No one is watching you.
How do you know?

02:45.298 --> 02:48.001
Because everyone
is watching them.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.505
If I had legs like that,
I'd be dangerous.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.673
Oh, word of caution:

02:52.673 --> 02:54.541
if you're going to
try it, do it outside.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.376
Here we are.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.179
Three fat-free
lattes.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.354
There it is again.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.422
What?
That feeling.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.123
I'm telling you,
someone is following me.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.625
Yeah, about a thousand
other people

03:11.625 --> 03:13.060
late for class
the way that I am.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.996
Do yourself a favor
and lose the paranoia, okay?

03:27.607 --> 03:29.209
Okay.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.777
I don't think
it's called paranoia

03:30.777 --> 03:32.512
when someone really <i>is</i>
following you.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.052
That's right.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.287
Walk into my parlor.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.455
Whoo!

03:41.455 --> 03:42.622
Better change that bag.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.763
Okay, the jig is up.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.866
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

03:53.266 --> 03:54.234
Mom?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.138
Yes, sweetheart.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.439
It's me.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.607
I can't believe it.

04:00.607 --> 04:01.775
What are you doing here?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.977
Well, originally, I
just came to see you.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.113
Now, I guess I'll be
sweeping up glass.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.314
Forget the glass.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.448
I'm worried about you.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.716
The Witches Council said

04:09.716 --> 04:11.384
that if we ever came
face to face

04:11.384 --> 04:13.186
you'd be turned
into a ball of wax.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.221
Oh, I know.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.789
But the truth is,
I've been flying up

04:15.789 --> 04:17.858
from Peru every
year to secretly
check up on you.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.959
Usually, I do it

04:18.959 --> 04:20.260
from a distance,
but this year

04:20.260 --> 04:21.428
you changed
the game plan.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.429
Wait a minute.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.597
We're looking at each other

04:23.597 --> 04:24.865
and you're not a ball of wax.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.067
Oh, my sweet girl.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.170
Oh, it's so great
to see you.

04:30.170 --> 04:34.407
Maybe the Witches
Council decided to
nullify the decree.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.678
So much for that theory.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.114
I hate decrees.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.655
Oh, right.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.957
Like you've never hugged
<i>your mother.</i>

04:51.358 --> 04:54.294
I'm no psychic,
but I predict that by fall

04:54.294 --> 05:00.167
every forward guy on campus will
have his legs in my pants.

05:00.167 --> 05:00.967
Let me rephrase that.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.068
Next question.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.671
How would you, the
designer, describe
the aesthetic vision

05:04.671 --> 05:06.640
behind Morgan Wear?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.442
Well, I like to think
of myself...

05:09.442 --> 05:10.377
Constantly.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.312
Oh, that's Pippi.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.480
She threads my bobbins.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.614
Anyway, back to the clothes.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.851
I would describe my look
as part Versace

05:17.851 --> 05:18.752
part Dolce.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.821
Hold the Gabbana.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.855
Hold the ego-tripping.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.456
Here's the truth
about her clothes

05:23.456 --> 05:24.624
and all clothes.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.726
They're just there
to cover our bodies... period.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.262
And the fashion industry should
be ashamed for making women

05:29.262 --> 05:31.231
who aren't wearing
the latest styles feel bad

05:31.231 --> 05:32.532
about themselves.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.034
They should feel bad.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.504
It's every woman's
responsibility to be au courant.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.772
I don't know
what that means

05:38.772 --> 05:40.373
but the audience
at Sundance will.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.875
( <i>knock at door</i> )

05:44.377 --> 05:45.445
Hi.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.546
Don't "hi" me.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.647
You're five minutes late.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.950
Now, the rest of my fittings are
all behind schedule.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.051
Why, five stupid minutes.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.752
The pre-fashion
show tension
is beginning

05:52.752 --> 05:54.154
to build between
designer and...

05:54.154 --> 05:55.822
student volunteering his time
for free.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.957
I'm curious.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.426
How do you feel about parading
yourself in front of people

05:59.426 --> 06:01.728
knowing they're looking at you
like a piece of meat?

06:01.728 --> 06:03.897
I don't think
people look at me like that.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.298
They respect me...

06:05.298 --> 06:07.901
as an intelligent individual
who aspires

06:07.901 --> 06:09.669
to a serious modeling career.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.872
Hey, Beefcake,
haul your shanks over here.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.440
Got to run.

06:15.242 --> 06:18.378
Zelda, this bundt
cake is fabulous.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.046
Thank you.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.782
Where did you find beetle parts
that are so moist?

06:22.782 --> 06:23.984
Uh, those
are raisins.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.152
I think Ma's been living
in the Peruvian Mountains

06:26.152 --> 06:27.921
a little too long.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.990
I must say, Diana,
you look great.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.958
I mean, you know, considering.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.226
Thanks, Hilda.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.462
I can't believe the Witches
Council could do something

06:35.462 --> 06:37.631
so horrible to you just
for bearing a witch's child.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.033
What's most painful is not
being able

06:40.033 --> 06:42.903
to be a part
of my daughter's life.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.705
You know, that Witches Council
is just a bunch

06:45.705 --> 06:47.741
of evil, passive-aggressive
control freaks.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.077
Although I must say,
that Burt Shlagel is a doll.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.747
Could he help us get Mom back
to her pre-paraffin self?

06:53.747 --> 06:54.547
I don't know.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.649
Oh, come on.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.783
That guy can do anything.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.919
He got you house seats
to Anne Boleyn's beheading.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.688
Well, there's no harm
in going down there and asking.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.523
And I'll bring the bundt cake.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.724
Burt's a nosher.

07:04.724 --> 07:05.959
Hey, while we're there

07:05.959 --> 07:08.962
maybe the Witches Council
will find it in their hearts

07:08.962 --> 07:10.230
to show <i>me</i> some mercy.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.431
Hmm.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.500
Innocent mother desperate
to see her daughter.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.535
Fascist cat who tried
to take over the world.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.670
Yeah, you've got a shot.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.038
( <i>crying</i> )

07:19.321 --> 07:20.106
Oh.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.775
Oh, I'm so nervous.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.109
Oh, everyone,
relax.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.545
Now, I know
how to schmooze
these old geezers.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.514
I'm sure they'll
show us some mercy.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.750
MAN:
Oh, no! Please,
not that!

07:30.750 --> 07:32.185
See 'ya.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.654
Aunt Hilda, we didn't come all
this way just to be scared off

07:34.654 --> 07:36.189
by a couple
of blood-curdling screams.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.459
The Council will see you now.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.862
Well, here goes.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.264
How's my lipstick?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.432
Perfect.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.801
It matches your forehead.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.004
Uh, excuse me

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
but I believe
you've brought us
to the wrong room.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.308
Yeah, we wanted to see
the Witches Council

07:55.308 --> 07:58.478
not the freshman class of
Just Out of Diapers University.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.213
This <i>is</i> the
Witches Council.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.147
BOTH:
What?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.382
Can I beverage you?

08:02.382 --> 08:03.516
I'm fine.
No, thank you.

08:03.516 --> 08:04.718
Lemonade.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.386
Shaken not stirred.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.289
What happened
to the old Witches Council?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.457
They were old.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.825
They were put out to pasture.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.993
Literally.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.761
Could we get on
with the business at hand?

08:14.761 --> 08:15.962
I have a 12:30 lunch thing.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.197
SALEM:
I'd like to speak first.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.732
( <i>clears throat</i> )

08:18.732 --> 08:21.201
As a former wrongdoer...

08:21.201 --> 08:22.035
ALL:
Shut up!

08:22.035 --> 08:22.736
Hmm?

08:22.736 --> 08:24.037
I'm here because I feel

08:24.037 --> 08:26.272
that my mother-- turned
into a ball of wax

08:26.272 --> 08:29.309
by the old Witches Council--
has been unfairly punished.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.077
Although the old
Witches Council thought

08:31.077 --> 08:32.312
my mother committed a crime

08:32.312 --> 08:34.314
I feel
this whole wax thing is just...

08:34.314 --> 08:36.049
unjust.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.151
I, therefore,
respectfully request

08:38.151 --> 08:42.122
that you turn my mother back
into... my mom.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.957
Yeah. That's a really
interesting notion

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
but I don't know.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.427
I'm-I'm just not responding
to it.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.795
WOMAN:
Maybe it's me,
but, uh...

08:48.795 --> 08:51.297
it doesn't seem like
there's that much at stake here.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.499
Not that much at stake?!

08:52.499 --> 08:54.801
I'm trying to bring my mother
back to life here!

08:54.801 --> 08:56.302
Excuse me.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.039
But we are talking
about a mother
and her child.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.574
Zelda and I have done our best
raising Sabrina

09:01.574 --> 09:03.777
but nothing can replace
a mother's love.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.545
That's why
I came back

09:05.545 --> 09:06.746
and took this chance.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.314
Because I wanted so much

09:08.314 --> 09:10.483
to be a part
of my daughter's life.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.419
That's really hard
when she looks like something

09:12.419 --> 09:14.120
that came off a Christmas
clearance aisle.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.588
Can I talk now?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.623
ALL:
No!

09:17.090 --> 09:19.125
Sabrina, we can't
undo the old decree.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.429
<i>But</i> there are a few
other options.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.696
Options are good.

09:23.696 --> 09:27.667
We can turn your mom
into a throw pillow

09:27.667 --> 09:29.169
a Pashmena Scarf

09:29.169 --> 09:30.537
or...

09:30.870 --> 09:32.205
a glass eye.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.873
Options stink.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.980
I can't believe that
stupid Witches Council.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.849
You know, I ask them
to make you human again

09:42.849 --> 09:45.218
and the best thing they can
come up with is a glass eye?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.087
You said no awfully quick.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.457
You could have at least
heard the colors.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.458
Sabrina, I am not

09:51.458 --> 09:52.592
going to take
this lying down.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.894
I'm going to scour every
magic book on this planet

09:54.894 --> 09:56.029
until I find a solution.

09:56.029 --> 09:56.863
And I'm going

09:56.863 --> 09:57.864
to traipse through

09:57.864 --> 09:59.165
every pasture
in the Other Realm

09:59.165 --> 10:00.233
until I find
Bert Shlagle.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.569
And what's Mom
supposed to do?

10:02.569 --> 10:04.971
Wax down a few surfboards?

10:04.971 --> 10:07.240
Sabrina, it's okay.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.542
Just cause I'm wax
doesn't mean we can't spend

10:09.542 --> 10:10.944
some quality time together.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.213
Introduce me
to your life.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.915
Show me everything
that goes on in your world.

10:15.915 --> 10:16.983
Okay, and then afterwards

10:16.983 --> 10:19.085
you can show me everything that
goes on in your...

10:19.085 --> 10:21.287
never mind.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.992
Well, here we are.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.694
Home sweet home.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.362
( <i>muffled</i> ):
It's lovely, sweetheart

10:29.362 --> 10:30.797
but I could see it
much better

10:30.797 --> 10:32.298
if you'd turn me
right side up.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.267
Oh, oops.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.070
Hey, Harvey, I'd like
you to meet my mom.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.605
Hi, Harvey.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.141
Wow, I can really see
the resemblance.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.809
Oh, we get that all the time.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.612
A... pleasure
meeting you.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.148
Got out of that family
just in time.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.484
Marissa, I don't care
what the doctor said.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.253
That mole is staying
right where it is

10:53.253 --> 10:55.155
until after you've modeled
the butterfly blouse.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.394
Sabrina, what is that hideous
ball of wax on the table?

11:01.394 --> 11:02.896
Hey, that's no ball of wax,
that my...

11:02.896 --> 11:03.763
candle.

11:04.531 --> 11:14.007
( <i>music plays</i> )

11:46.839 --> 11:49.008
And this is the newspaper.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.110
Where I work, and, you know

11:51.110 --> 11:53.012
sometimes just look like
I'm working.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.182
Honey, I am so proud of you.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.283
Thanks.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.519
You know, your support
really means a lot to me.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.354
Hey, Sabrina.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.488
Josh, hi.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.489
What are you doing here

12:03.489 --> 12:05.391
with a ball of wax?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.994
I, uh, I just came by
to, um...

12:07.994 --> 12:10.330
you know,
wax this table.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.031
Okay.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.200
But just so you know,
they make that in a spray.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.103
Oh, I know, I just wanted
to use this up first.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.504
Right.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.441
Okay, I'll talk
to you later.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.278
That's my boyfriend.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.080
He's adorable.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.916
He's got my... votive.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.050
Oh, Mom.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.485
( <i>gasping</i> )

12:34.754 --> 12:37.156
Miles, I can't iron with
that lens in my face.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.157
I am sorry.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.059
I have a cinematic duty
to capture every second

12:40.059 --> 12:42.195
of your complete
emotional breakdown.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.963
That's good.
More of that.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.632
( <i>groaning</i> )

12:45.632 --> 12:46.733
Less of that.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.701
Morgan, can you
come here a second?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.703
I'm having trouble
with my zipper.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.106
You pull the little tab up.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.040
It won't go.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.175
I guess if you want
something done right

12:56.175 --> 12:57.577
you have to do it yourself.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.645
I hate that.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.613
I don't know what
the problem is.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.682
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.652
This zipper is trying to
squeeze its way around

13:05.652 --> 13:07.253
five pounds of fresh fat.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.788
Have you gained weight?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.356
No, no.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.724
All I've eaten
for a week

13:11.724 --> 13:13.993
are Hilda's fat free
lattes and muffins.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.261
( <i>sighs</i> )

13:15.261 --> 13:17.196
Eric, stand up straight.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.699
You look like
a gooseneck lamp.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.200
We're back.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.502
I mean, hey, everybody.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.503
I mean

13:23.503 --> 13:25.638
I can't wait for this
fashion show to be over.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.473
That makes...
seven of us.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.608
Oh, is that so?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.543
And I guess a year from
now, when you're posing

13:30.543 --> 13:32.412
for magazine covers,
you'll be ruing the day

13:32.412 --> 13:33.780
I ever made you
a fashion model.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.682
I don't think you
heard him correctly.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.816
They're ruing you now.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.686
It's been nonstop abuse
ever since we took this gig.

13:39.686 --> 13:40.987
Well, here's a thought--

13:40.987 --> 13:42.155
un-take it.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.389
Nobody's stopping you.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.091
Fine?
Fine.
Fine.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.092
Fine.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.860
We're out
of here.
Go ahead!

13:47.860 --> 13:49.562
Who needs you?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.067
Oh, my God.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.234
I do.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.969
Morgan, the show is tomorrow.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.505
Oh, what have I done?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.874
Sabrina, this show means
everything to me.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.710
Designing clothes
is the only thing

14:03.710 --> 14:05.345
that I have a real talent for.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.780
Except curling my
eyelashes in a moving car

14:07.780 --> 14:09.882
but I can't make
a living doing that.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.117
Not to push...

14:11.117 --> 14:12.385
but it'd really
help the scene

14:12.385 --> 14:13.920
dramatically if you
cried right now.

14:13.920 --> 14:14.921
Go.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.155
Morgan

14:16.155 --> 14:17.623
if you plan to succeed
in any profession

14:17.623 --> 14:19.826
you're going to have to learn
to treat people with respect.

14:19.826 --> 14:20.760
Fine.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.162
But first I need people.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.898
Come on, maybe we
can get them back.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.038
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.309
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.343
I know.

14:37.343 --> 14:38.978
Why did I have
to tell Marissa

14:38.978 --> 14:40.747
that her back fat
was wiggling?

14:40.747 --> 14:44.617
Where am I going to find
new models by tomorrow?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.186
Mom?

14:47.186 --> 14:48.721
Are you here?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.124
It's Sabrina,
your idiot daughter

14:51.124 --> 14:53.559
who stuck you
next to a steam iron.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.727
Look at you.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.963
What have I done?

14:57.697 --> 15:00.533
We were just getting
to know each other, too.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.869
Now I've lost you forever.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.772
Mom, I'm so sorry.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.078
Mom, how did...?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.479
I don't have a clue.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.048
Oh, sweetheart.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.352
Sabrina, great news.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.154
I just found out,
if you melt the wax

15:21.154 --> 15:22.555
and mix it with
your tears...

15:22.555 --> 15:24.424
Oh, I guess you
figured it out.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.893
Great, but there's
one more thing.

15:26.893 --> 15:27.994
Don't look at each other!

15:27.994 --> 15:30.363
Turn around, quick!

15:30.363 --> 15:31.798
Sabrina, listen.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.500
If your mother turns into
another ball of wax

15:34.500 --> 15:36.836
nothing will ever
bring her back, ever.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.037
But what if I...

15:38.037 --> 15:38.438
No.

15:38.438 --> 15:38.971
Not even if I...

15:38.971 --> 15:39.472
No.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.239
How bout if I...

15:40.239 --> 15:43.209
No.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.044
Sabrina

15:45.044 --> 15:46.612
I'm sorry.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.115
Oh, honey.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.584
If I could, I would
trade all my magic

15:51.584 --> 15:54.287
so you and your mother
could be together.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.755
Thanks, Aunt Zelda.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.623
Don't cry, darling.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.525
We'll do what we've
always done.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.261
We'll write,
we'll call.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.896
And, who knows?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.665
With the turnover rate
at the Witches Council

16:05.665 --> 16:06.666
pretty soon
we could appeal

16:06.666 --> 16:08.534
to a whole new group
of idiots.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.871
Sabrina, I promise you

16:11.871 --> 16:15.641
we will always be
in each other's lives.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.078
I love you, Mom.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.948
I love you, too,
sweetheart.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.453
I need an ending
for my film.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.522
Is Morgan aware that by
firing those models

16:29.522 --> 16:31.657
she's damaged her career
and mine?

16:32.191 --> 16:33.292
Are you listening?

16:33.292 --> 16:34.460
Morgan
couldn't get

16:34.460 --> 16:36.062
those models
to come back?

16:36.062 --> 16:37.096
No.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.831
She even told
Eric she'd name
a purse after him.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.832
Nothing.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.667
I know this is
an unpopular position

16:41.667 --> 16:43.369
but I feel kind of bad
for Morgan.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.671
Her clothes are really great.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.307
Okay, there was a cute
sweater sitting on the couch.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.408
I tried it on, sue me.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.610
I tried it on, too.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.112
I mean, normally I don't
look good in raglan sleeves

16:53.112 --> 16:54.413
but that sweater-- hoo-ha!

16:54.413 --> 16:55.615
Hoo-ha.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.984
You know,
Morgan is pretty persuasive.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.419
I'm sure she'll find
some other models to fill in.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.522
I can almost guarantee it.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.716
Okay, so Sabrina will
never be a supermodel.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.886
And all those years
of supermodel lessons
out the window.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.264
And then there's Miles.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.706
Well, he's a natural.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.286
This is a disaster.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.321
I'm ruined.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.856
No, I'm worse than ruined.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.893
I'm going to spend my life
making soy mochachinos.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.596
Hold on, you know,
we still have evening wear.

18:16.596 --> 18:21.300
And, I have a feeling things
will go a lot better this time.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.473
You know, the neurotic
one's kind of cute

19:00.473 --> 19:02.074
when he's all gussied up.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.004
ALL:
Morgan! Morgan!

19:32.004 --> 19:33.973
Morgan!

19:38.110 --> 19:40.680
( <i>cheering</i> )

19:43.816 --> 19:45.751
You did great,
sweetheart.

19:45.751 --> 19:46.752
But technically

19:46.752 --> 19:48.421
you should not have used
your pointy finger

19:48.421 --> 19:49.422
to make Morgan look good.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.923
I know,
but Morgan's really talented

19:50.923 --> 19:52.358
and I wanted people to see that.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.359
Good one.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.860
Way to find
the loophole.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.396
Oh, what's wrong,
sweetheart?

19:57.396 --> 19:58.531
No.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.068
I just wish my mother
could have been here to see me.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.235
Sabrina....

20:12.411 --> 20:14.113
"Miss Cavanaugh's
line of clothing

20:14.113 --> 20:16.082
which is very
forward, directional..."

20:16.082 --> 20:17.083
Directional!

20:17.083 --> 20:18.551
"...texturally mind blowing

20:18.551 --> 20:20.152
"will certainly establish her

20:20.152 --> 20:22.321
as one of fashion's
rising young stars."

20:22.321 --> 20:24.390
( <i>cheering</i> )

20:24.390 --> 20:26.459
You know, reviews don't get
any better than that.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.993
Neither do friends.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.996
Thanks for all your
help, everybody.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.932
It worked out
perfectly.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.400
Oh, by the way.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.703
You're going to have to be
a little more lenient

20:37.703 --> 20:39.205
with my work schedule

20:39.205 --> 20:42.208
now that I am a budding
superstar designer.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.576
I'm behind you 100%.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.377
And to show you my support

20:45.377 --> 20:48.914
I made you a couple
of my double chocolate

20:48.914 --> 20:50.683
fat-free cream pies.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.351
Oh.

20:52.985 --> 20:56.055
Mm, I don't know
how you do it?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.056
When you try to get

20:57.056 --> 20:59.391
in that skirt in two weeks,
you'll know.
