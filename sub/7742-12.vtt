00:02.002 --> 00:03.211
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:04.129 --> 00:06.923
Could either of you ladies tell me
where I might find Jackie Peyton?

00:08.759 --> 00:09.759
Sam called.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.135
I need to break up with him.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.638
I don't know whose MRI you saw,
but it wasn't hers.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.889
Yes, I understand that.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.016
-I need to talk to you.
-Later, I promise.

00:17.101 --> 00:19.143
Totally willing to keep the campaign going.

00:19.228 --> 00:22.355
I'll, I don't know, pay out of pocket.
I could pay for the ad space.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.157
You need to promise me
that we're not gonna take that money.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.325
I promise.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.495
Have you seen your new school?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.580
Give me that phone!

00:41.166 --> 00:43.960
Please tell me
you didn't take her fucking money.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.796
-Seriously, Kevin.
-Dad!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.841
-Kevin, don't do this!
-Where are you going?

01:51.487 --> 01:53.654
Kevin, please get back in the car.
You're freaking them out.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.616
-Hey, Dad, what you doing?
-Sit back down, Fi.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.076
I'm not getting into
an enclosed space with you.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.245
You should sit back with Grace and me.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.750
It's okay, you guys.
I just need to stretch my legs.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
He's having a tantrum.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.253
You know what, guys?
There's nothing to worry about.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.922
Daddy and I used to do this kind of thing
all the time.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.381
Actually, Grace, you're right.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.594
I'm having a tantrum, but it's totally okay.
I'm walking it off.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.596
You know what? You're right.
He's having a tantrum,

02:18.680 --> 02:21.224
and it's totally okay.
Nobody has to worry about Daddy.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.587
Don't talk to me.

02:59.054 --> 03:03.266
Hey. He called me.
Asked me to come and get him.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.439
Tell me you didn't fucking say anything.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.698
"Thank you" would've been cool.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.056
I can't believe you left me
on the side of the road.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.100
I can't either.

03:54.109 --> 03:58.029
-I took the money...
-I don't give a fuck why you took it.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.363
It doesn't matter.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.533
It does matter, Kevin.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.119
You're right. I'm not here.

04:07.915 --> 04:12.501
Not in the way you are.
When they fall down, they run to you.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.421
There are days when I look at them
and I think,

04:15.505 --> 04:18.674
"You know, what the fuck?
I gave birth to you..."

04:26.058 --> 04:29.143
And I fucking hate myself
for being so selfish

04:29.227 --> 04:31.729
and for being competitive.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.858
You keep saying we don't
need anybody's help, we're fine,

04:35.943 --> 04:39.904
but I don't have the peace of mind
that you do, Kevin,

04:39.988 --> 04:43.324
and I'm fucking jealous
that you can sleep at night.

04:48.872 --> 04:54.919
Yes, I took the money, and I'm sorry,
but I did it to help us, not to rip us apart.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.588
Did you always know
you were gonna take it?

04:57.673 --> 04:58.839
Think.

05:03.095 --> 05:06.013
I pretended to consult you about it, but...

05:07.808 --> 05:12.061
You knew that, baby.
You always know that. I knew you knew it.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.730
It never even occurred to me.

05:28.537 --> 05:33.708
I keep telling you, I'm no prize,
and you won't listen.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.353
-Is that everything?
-I love you, Kevin.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.235
Yes, that's everything.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.432
Hey, Dad, did you walk all the way home?

06:31.516 --> 06:35.561
-I came home on a motorcycle.
-Did we get a motorcycle?

06:39.191 --> 06:41.901
He got a ride. From Eddie.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.533
-I was up.
-Everything is okay. You know that, right?

06:57.459 --> 07:01.212
She left them in the door.
We could've been robbed.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.632
I was just gonna say that.
What if somebody got in?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.467
I'd have protected you.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.639
Yeah, but you weren't here.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.144
You guys are so smart.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.327
-Can I ask your opinion about something?
-No.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.125
It's for Lenny. Too much?

07:39.209 --> 07:45.464
Yes, if you just want to be friends,
no, if thanking him for years of service.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.091
See, that's what's bothering me.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.177
Kind of hate that I saw it
and thought of him.

08:10.365 --> 08:14.618
-She broke up with you, didn't she?
-Yep.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.746
I'm sorry, man.

08:19.374 --> 08:24.128
Between us, you are dodging
the world's biggest bullet.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.463
-I am?
-You are.

08:26.548 --> 08:31.844
All that tie-dye hippie,
everyone-is-equal shit, it's all for show.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.638
She wants to be a doctor's wife.
Pretty much said it out loud.

08:34.723 --> 08:38.100
And that fucking cat. Dude!

08:40.145 --> 08:44.106
-You slept with her.
-Yes, I did, my friend.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.109
-Friend?
-That's why I'm telling you.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.152
What the fuck?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.821
Why would you want to be with someone
who has a thing for doctors?

08:50.906 --> 08:53.991
You're a nurse. You deserve better.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.078
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

09:31.196 --> 09:32.196
Jackie?

09:33.073 --> 09:37.368
You are not gentle.
Why can't you be more gentle, like her?

09:37.452 --> 09:41.914
-Yes, she's perfect, I suck. Whatever, Coop.
-May I?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.458
I am so gonna fire that guy.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.212
So what if I slept with his girlfriend?
People need to grow up.

09:48.296 --> 09:53.133
Yeah, firing Sam would be very grown-up
on your part.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.235
-Heard you officially broke your nose.
-People need to mind their own business!

10:11.319 --> 10:13.445
That we do!

10:22.122 --> 10:24.748
I am sorry I couldn't talk last night.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.880
I figured you'd rather talk in person anyway.
It seemed important.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.968
Well, no, actually, I'd rather have
talked to you over the phone.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.475
I went up to ortho, Jackie.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.237
You hear that?
There's something in the ceiling.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.703
What, no duck sauce?

11:30.607 --> 11:31.607
Follow me.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.071
-It was just duck sauce.
-Stop talking.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.577
-You have got to be kidding me.
-Okay, excuse me.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.416
-Hey, I'm Lenny.
-Hey, Lenny.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.340
Someone is smoking. What kind of moron
does that in a hospital?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.970
I will find you!

12:13.566 --> 12:15.692
-Well, hello.
-Where are you?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.781
In my office,
under a pile of paperwork. You?

12:20.865 --> 12:26.120
God, you are a worse liar than I am.
You're in the old hallway.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.997
I can hear your heels
all the way from the chapel.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.583
God, don't tell me
you've been reduced to prayer.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.335
I'm getting there.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.732
Kevin left me last night.

12:55.817 --> 13:01.405
He's back in the house now.
And I knew I was fucking up with you.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
Look, I tried to tell you,
I did not want an MRI.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.162
I know. I know.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.957
You're afraid to see the damage.
I remember.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.210
I'm more afraid of seeing
that there's nothing wrong with me.

13:15.295 --> 13:19.256
I mean, there's plenty wrong with me.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.176
-I never lied about the pain.
-I know that.

13:25.847 --> 13:31.894
And how you manage the pain
is a private matter.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.481
But I involved you, and I am sorry.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.943
Well, it probably doesn't help
that I'm shoving checks in your purse

13:40.028 --> 13:45.949
and telling you to get MRIs and generally
looking the other way, but honestly, Jacks,

13:46.034 --> 13:49.953
you're an adult and you're
my favorite reason for coming to work.

13:50.872 --> 13:55.292
I check the nursing schedule
to coordinate my shifts with yours.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.835
That's sweet.

14:04.093 --> 14:09.139
Come on, let's go, then.
Light some candles, repent for our sins.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.351
-Might be fun.
-Rain check?

14:14.979 --> 14:18.607
-You're really awful.
-That's what I'm trying to tell you.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.910
Zoey!

14:31.996 --> 14:35.165
-Fully clothed!
-In a chapel. Really trashy.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.546
The entire nation, Dr. Cooper,
is experiencing a nursing shortage.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.717
-I'm hesitant to let anyone go at this point.
-But he broke my nose.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.304
It's my understanding
that it was already broken.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.765
He slept with my girlfriend.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.603
Really, Dr. Cooper. You get to be a doctor.
Isn't that enough?

14:56.688 --> 15:00.524
-Am I fired?
-Yes. There is a chain of command here.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.025
I'm extending your probationary period.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.946
You can thank me
by not assaulting any more of my staff.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.123
-See?
-I have something for you.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.757
-A bill? For what?
-Ad space.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.719
You said you wanted
to be the face of All Saints.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.638
Six more weeks. Knock yourself out.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.684
Someone is smoking!

15:45.403 --> 15:50.949
Here, right here. I'm coming to get you!
Get me a ladder.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.359
No. I got it.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.375
Flashlight.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.266
Jesus Christ, it's God.

16:58.893 --> 17:03.397
-What are you doing?
-I'm watching over my flock.

17:03.481 --> 17:07.901
-You're smoking.
-I'm God. I can do two things at once.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.321
Yeah? Well, do them
in your own apartment.

17:11.406 --> 17:17.119
There's vermin in my building.
They're fumigating and I can't breathe.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.580
I see. You can't stay here.

17:22.917 --> 17:27.963
But it's cozy, and I can keep an eye on shit.
I'm not ready to walk among you.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.969
-There's a lot of pain down there.
-I have candy bars in my office.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.221
You got a TV?

17:36.305 --> 17:39.141
Now, you tell me where and when
to meet you, because otherwise,

17:39.225 --> 17:43.103
I'm coming down there, and you can
deal with me then. Your choice.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.022
-Can I smoke?
-No.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.070
I talked to your landlord.
He said that it should be safe

17:52.155 --> 17:55.365
for you to go back tomorrow morning
to your apartment.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.368
You can stay here till then.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.954
-Below the ceiling.
-You are good.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.125
Hi.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.216
-Jackie around today?
-Nice to see you, Mr. Martin.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.635
Yes, try the nurses' station.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.262
Cheers.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.641
I got a bad feeling about that guy.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.061
Now, is that any way to talk
about one of your flock?

18:25.146 --> 18:28.398
-He's not one of mine.
-Hush.

18:37.283 --> 18:42.287
That was a perfectly good nose.
Now it's all fucked up.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.721
What the fuck?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.350
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.478
Come on in.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.026
Wow, you are drunk.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.912
I know you don't like me, but...

19:28.709 --> 19:31.545
Lenny, this is my mom. Mom, this is Lenny.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.091
"Hello, Mrs. Barkow. What's up?"

19:38.094 --> 19:41.179
-Isn’t he great?
-Zoey, are you alone?

19:43.057 --> 19:45.809
-Yes.
-Okay.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.811
Listen very carefully. I need you to get Thor.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.647
Tell him I need a wheelchair, three blankets,

19:50.731 --> 19:53.984
-a liter IV and four of Zofran, now.
-Okay.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.035
-So what's going on?
-He's totally wasted.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.289
We have to keep him awake
or he's gonna aspirate.

20:10.293 --> 20:13.712
-The basement.
-Yep. We're going down.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.388
-Whatever. This is none of my business.
-Did she give you a whole song and dance

20:23.472 --> 20:26.141
about her fucked-up back
and her horrible life?

20:26.225 --> 20:30.103
'Cause I'm telling you,
you can't believe a word she says.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.354
That's not true.

20:31.439 --> 20:36.443
Did she tell you that I refused
to take money for the girls?

20:36.527 --> 20:38.653
That I made her promise me,
on our daughters' lives,

20:38.738 --> 20:43.783
not to take your fucking money?
Did she tell you that part?

20:43.868 --> 20:46.494
I didn't think so.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.164
You know the drill. Stay awake.
Do not pee yourself.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.793
There is a sink over there if you need it.
Where is Thor?

20:53.878 --> 20:58.924
-Why are you helping me?
-Because you are fucked up, my friend.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.301
Vodka and Hawaiian Punch,

21:03.054 --> 21:06.514
like a gallon, really, really fast.

21:08.309 --> 21:12.729
-I thought you were a pill guy.
-I would have had to steal pills.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.856
That would've made me feel bad.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.401
Sorry. Thought of a way to keep him awake.

21:18.486 --> 21:22.656
Had to run back up for a sec,
and you will be so glad I did.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.117
Give me your shoe.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.329
-I gotta head back up. Just keep him awake.
-Jackie.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.666
Jackie.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.003
Two minutes.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.846
I love you guys.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.060
A five, six, seven, eight.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.274
Look alive, Sam.

22:04.949 --> 22:09.119
Again. One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

22:09.829 --> 22:10.870
Sam.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.095
Hey. How are you?

22:29.098 --> 22:32.475
-What a fucked-up day.
-I hear you.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.188
Thank you for bringing Kevin home.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.242
-Eddie, it's all crashing down around me.
-I know.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.374
So...

22:58.335 --> 23:03.089
-Step aside, right?
-I gotta put my marriage back together.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.383
Yeah.

23:05.468 --> 23:10.096
The fucked-up thing is, I want to do it
for Kevin as much as I do for you.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.185
-He's, like, cut in half, man.
-Yeah, I know.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.024
-You gonna be okay?
-You know me.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.781
Anyone who knows you
knows they don't know you.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.499
See? You know me.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.773
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.527
I don't know.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.155
Come on. Give it.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.544
Uber.

24:24.630 --> 24:28.758
-I can't believe you did this.
-Neither can I.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.097
What's it for? Years of service?

24:36.183 --> 24:38.601
I hope so.

24:38.686 --> 24:42.438
Man, I feel bad.
All I got you was duck sauce.

24:42.523 --> 24:46.651
-Yeah, you got the better end of the deal.
-Seriously.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.702
Stop walking.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.039
-A slippery little thing, ain't you?
-I'm sorry, do I know you?

25:00.124 --> 25:03.293
-I want my drugs.
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

25:03.377 --> 25:08.923
-You stole $12,000 worth of Roxies off me.
-So what are you, a drug dealer?

25:09.008 --> 25:10.633
Why don't you call the cops?
They can handle this.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.719
You don't want to fuck with me.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.388
You come into my hospital
and you fucking threaten me?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.432
Do you have any idea how many cops
are gonna be up your ass

25:17.516 --> 25:20.143
-if you lay a fucking finger on me?
-How many?

25:25.566 --> 25:27.817
Oh, my God, he's not a friend of yours,
is he?

25:27.902 --> 25:32.322
I love you just a little bit more
than I did an hour ago.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.080
Hey, guys!

25:46.003 --> 25:47.337
Hey, guys!

25:49.048 --> 25:51.341
-Hey, babe.
-Hi.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.927
Just so you know, we've got company.

25:57.848 --> 26:02.393
Wow. Great. Well, hi. Welcome.
We have some cake.

26:02.478 --> 26:07.106
-What's up? Where are the girls?
-Let's just sit down for a minute.

26:10.611 --> 26:14.530
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.366
-No fucking way.
-It's okay, Jacks.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.285
No, no way. You have to leave right now.
I'm sorry. Where are the girls?

26:19.370 --> 26:22.205
My sister's, and I asked her to come. Okay?

26:22.289 --> 26:23.831
You are fucking hilarious.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.875
He fucking hates your guts.
You hate her guts.

26:25.960 --> 26:29.170
You invited her all the way out here
to Queens to fucking gossip about me?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.756
-This isn't what this is about.
-Do you think anybody wants to listen

26:31.840 --> 26:33.383
to what you have to fucking say about this?

26:33.467 --> 26:34.425
You're a drug addict.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.637
And you're a fucking idiot. You have
no idea what you're talking about.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.060
Yeah, you know what?
You're fucking pathetic, both of you.

27:49.752 --> 27:53.379
Hi, my name is Jackie. I'm a drug addict.

28:05.059 --> 28:06.309
Blow me.
