to push for a long time.

talked to corporate about it.

of the session I

Um, so looking through the cards
I've noticed that many of you

05:50.250 --> 05:52.030
wrote down the same
incident, which is ironic

05:52.030 --> 05:54.340

exact incident I was

do a routine and everybody

complaint to corporate?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.480

08:36.940 --> 08:39.660
And I knew all
this stuff already.

08:39.660 --> 08:42.220
So I could-- you know, I
could sign something that

08:42.220 --> 08:43.830
says that I taught something.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.180
Or that I helped
you teach something.

08:45.180 --> 08:47.050
So, Pam?

08:47.050 --> 08:47.890
Where is she?

08:47.890 --> 08:50.040
Pam, could we change
something on this?

08:50.040 --> 08:53.730
Um, Michael, can I-- can
I talk to you candidly?

08:53.730 --> 08:54.430
Sure.

08:54.430 --> 08:57.190
MR. BROWN: We both know that I
am here because of the comments

08:57.190 --> 08:57.970
that you made.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.130
Here's the thing,
this office, I

09:00.130 --> 09:06.800
think is very advanced in
terms of racial awareness.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.970
And, uh, it's probably more
advanced than you're used to.

09:08.970 --> 09:09.670
Um.

09:09.670 --> 09:11.100
That's probably throwing
you off a little.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.000
It's not throwing me.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.420
I need your signature.
-OK.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.100
Well, I know.
You told me that. several times.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.670
MR. BROWN: Yes, but you're
not listening to me.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.610
Yours is the only
signature I need.

09:19.610 --> 09:20.370
Oh, OK.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.490
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices

09:22.490 --> 09:26.300
to put you through this seminar
for the comments that you made.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.160
And the only reason why I
make copies for everyone

09:28.160 --> 09:29.490
was so that you
wouldn't be embarrassed.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.730
Well, here I am thinking
that you actually

09:38.730 --> 09:43.000
cared about diversity training.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.430
And you don't.

09:44.430 --> 09:46.400
-Don't worry about dating.
-All right.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.100
Well.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.520
OK.
Thank you.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.220
Yeah.

09:58.050 --> 09:59.470
I regret my actions.

09:59.470 --> 10:01.570
I regret offending my coworkers.

10:01.570 --> 10:05.020
I pledge to bring my best
spirit of honesty, empathy,

10:05.020 --> 10:07.490
respect, and open-mindedness--
open-mindedness,

10:07.490 --> 10:09.020
is that even a word?

10:09.020 --> 10:10.960
Um, into the workplace.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.670
In this way I can
truly be a hero.

Signed Daffy Duck.

He's gonna lose it
when he reads that.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.990
Yeah, hi.
Is Mr. Deckard around?

10:27.990 --> 10:30.450
Oh, well, could you just
have him call me after lunch?

10:30.450 --> 10:31.150
Thank you.

10:34.130 --> 10:41.250
I pledge to always keep an
open mind and an open heart.

10:50.110 --> 10:54.660
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.200
But a pledge?
Come on.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.000
I mean, who are we?
The Girl Scouts?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.020
No.

10:59.020 --> 11:02.360
Look, the, um, the
guy, Mr. Brown,

11:02.360 --> 11:04.070
uh, he got us halfway there.

11:04.070 --> 11:06.040
He got us talking.
Well, no.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.410
I got us talking.

11:07.410 --> 11:08.630
He got us nothing.

11:08.630 --> 11:09.720
He insulted us.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.200
And then he abandoned us.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.930
You call that
diversity training?

11:12.930 --> 11:14.290
I don't.

11:14.290 --> 11:16.930
Were there any connections
between any of us?

11:16.930 --> 11:18.740
Did anyone look each
other in the eye?

11:18.740 --> 11:21.100
Was there any emotion going on?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.090
Were-- no.

11:23.090 --> 11:24.570
Where was the heart?

11:24.570 --> 11:25.490
I didn't see any heart.

11:25.490 --> 11:28.310
Where was my Oprah moment?

11:28.310 --> 11:29.410
OK.

11:29.410 --> 11:31.930
Get as much done as you
can before lunch because,

11:31.930 --> 11:35.740
uh, afterward I'm going
to have you all in tears.

Come on.
Here we go.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.800
It's time.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.360
Let's do some good.

12:00.950 --> 12:02.850
-Sorry.
-No.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.800
This is not a joke.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.690
OK?

12:05.690 --> 12:06.540
That was offensive.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.620
And lame.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.200
So double offensive.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.640
This is an environment
of welcoming.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.580
And you should just get
the hell out of here.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.110
OK.
Let's go.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.230
Let's do it.
Come on.

you for coming in.

Um, diversity is the
cornerstone of progress,

12:37.190 --> 12:38.700
as I've always said.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.680
But don't take my word for it.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.710
Let's take look at the tape.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.490
Hi.
I'm Michael Scott.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.650
I'm in charge of Dunder

12:51.650 --> 12:53.460
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.570
But I'm also the founder
of Diversity Tomorrow

12:56.570 --> 12:58.610
because today is almost over.

13:01.260 --> 13:05.830
Abraham Lincoln once said
that if you're a racist,

13:05.830 --> 13:09.120
I will attack you
with the north.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.550
And those are the
principles that I

13:10.550 --> 13:12.040
carry with me in the workplace.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.750
OK.

-Uh, is that it?

13:22.340 --> 13:23.130
Uh, yes.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.470
I only had an hour
to put it together,

13:24.470 --> 13:26.390
but I'm gonna add
on to it later on.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.820
It was kind of hard to hear.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.300
Uh, yes.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.260
That probably had something
to do with the camera work.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.160
Anybody else?

13:33.160 --> 13:34.000
Um.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.740
I have a customer meeting.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.540
Yeah, well, if you leave
we'll only have two left.

Yes.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.470
Enjoy.

13:40.470 --> 13:41.270
Absolutely.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.870
Namaste.
OK.

13:43.870 --> 13:47.580
Well, since I am leading this,
let's get down to business.

13:47.580 --> 13:50.700
And why don't I just
kind of introduce myself.

OK?

Irish, German, and Scottish.

you might not know

14:05.550 --> 14:09.370
is that I am also part
Native American Indian.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.910
What part Native American?

14:10.910 --> 14:12.420
2/15.

14:12.420 --> 14:13.300
2/15?

14:13.300 --> 14:14.880
That fraction doesn't
make any sense.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.710
Well, you know what?

14:16.710 --> 14:18.010

for me to talk about.

Right here.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.010
You're on.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.200
OK, Michael.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.430
Uh, both my parents
were born in Mexico.

14:32.430 --> 14:33.200
Oh, yeah.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.250
And, uh, they moved
to the United States

14:35.250 --> 14:36.700
a year before I was born.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.530
MICHAEL: Yeah.

14:37.530 --> 14:39.610
So I grew up in
the United States

14:39.610 --> 14:41.810
and my parents were Mexican.
-Wow.

14:41.810 --> 14:44.750
That is, that is a great story.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.440
That's the American
dream right there, right?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.570
Thank you.
Yeah.

14:48.570 --> 14:53.140
Um, let me ask you, is
there a term besides Mexican

14:53.140 --> 14:54.910
that you prefer?

14:54.910 --> 14:57.000
Something less offensive?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.150
Mexican isn't offensive.

14:58.150 --> 15:00.660
Well, it has
certain connotations.

15:00.660 --> 15:01.770
Like what?

Like, I don't--
well, I don't know.

-No, no, no.
-You must have meant something.

Now remember--

15:09.360 --> 15:10.260
I'm just curious.

Hello?

15:19.540 --> 15:20.990
Hello?

15:20.990 --> 15:22.470
I have something here.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.580
I want you to take a card,
put it on your fore--

15:24.580 --> 15:26.130
don't look at the card.

15:26.130 --> 15:27.060
I want you to take the card.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.090
And I want you to put
it on your forehead.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.710
And take a card.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.040
Take a card, any card.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.930
Um, and I want you to treat
other people like the race

that is on their forehead.

15:39.750 --> 15:40.610
OK?

15:40.610 --> 15:42.530
So everybody has
a different race.

15:42.530 --> 15:45.190
Nobody knows what their race is.

15:45.190 --> 15:49.740
So I want you to really go
for it because this is real.

just an exercise.

have anybody be an Arab.

be too explosive.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.050
Uh, no pun intended.

17:27.050 --> 17:30.200
But I just thought
too soon for Arabs.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.280
I downloaded it on her computer.
I hope she doesn't mind.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.000
She just had a lot
of extra space.

17:41.000 --> 17:41.760
No way.
No.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.960
I think she really
likes this stuff.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.350
Great.

17:44.350 --> 17:46.670
She's cute, huh?

17:46.670 --> 17:47.600
Yeah.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.700
You know, she's engaged, but

17:49.700 --> 17:50.400
Oh, no.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.530
The girl on the sketch.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.960
Oh, yeah.
She's hot.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.180
Yeah.

17:56.180 --> 17:57.670
Hey.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.160
Hey.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.910
You want to go to the beach?

18:00.910 --> 18:03.300
Sure.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.670
You want to get high?

18:04.670 --> 18:06.810
No.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.190
-I think you do, mon.
-Stop it.

18:08.190 --> 18:09.290
OK.
All right.

18:09.290 --> 18:10.690
No.
It's good.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.370
It-- you just, you,
you need to push it.

18:13.370 --> 18:15.580
You know, you need to
go a little bit further.

18:15.580 --> 18:16.790
Uh, all right.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.760
OK.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.940
(INDIAN ACCENT):
Kelly, how are you?

18:20.940 --> 18:22.350
I just had the longest meeting.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.930
Oh, welcome to my
convenient store.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.440
Would you like
some cookie cookie?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
Oh, I have some very
delicious cookie cookie.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.560
Only $0.99 plus tax.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.890
Try my cookie cookie.

18:32.890 --> 18:34.090
Try my cookie cookie.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.080
Try my cookie cookie.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.070
Try my--

18:46.530 --> 18:47.720
All right.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.280
All right.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.720
Yes.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.140
That was great.

18:53.140 --> 18:54.580
She gets it.

18:54.580 --> 18:57.010
Now she knows what it's
like to be a minority.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.810
Mr. Deckard, we didn't lose
your sale today, did we?

19:05.810 --> 19:07.380
Excellent.
OK.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.470
Let me just get
your-- what's that?

19:11.470 --> 19:12.720
No.
We didn't.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.010
We didn't close last time.

19:15.010 --> 19:19.600
I just need your, uh-- oh.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.670
What, what code were you given?

19:22.670 --> 19:24.590
Oh, OK.

19:24.590 --> 19:25.290
Yeah, no.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.640
That's actually
another salesman here.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.340
Yeah.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.670
I can redo it if
you want to do that.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.060
Oh, he gave you a discount.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.890
No, I don't blame you.

19:32.890 --> 19:35.580
I just hated it when
that guy was in here.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.090
Mr. Brown, if that
was his real name.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.380
I mean, he had never
met any of us before.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.510
And here he was telling
us how to do our thing.

19:44.510 --> 19:48.060
I just want-- I just
wanted to do it our way.

19:48.060 --> 19:50.670
You know?
On our own.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.340
Man, I should have
gotten some food.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.820
Maybe some spaghetti?

19:56.820 --> 19:57.520
MICHAEL: OK, Kevin.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.170
You can take off that thing.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.310
OK?

20:01.310 --> 20:06.560
That would have really, really
shown him up, wouldn't it?

20:06.560 --> 20:10.110
If I had brought in some
burritos or some coloured

20:10.110 --> 20:13.220
greens, or some pad thai.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.370
Love pad thai.

20:14.370 --> 20:16.650
STANLEY: It's collared greens.
MICHAEL: What?

20:16.650 --> 20:18.810
It's collared greens.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.860
That doesn't really make
sense because you don't

20:20.860 --> 20:22.870
call them collared people.
That's offensive.

20:25.730 --> 20:27.660
Hmm.
OK.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.010
Well, it's after 5:00.

20:29.010 --> 20:33.280
So thank you very much.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.500
Buena vista, Oscar.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.950
Thank you.

20:36.950 --> 20:38.120
Good job.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.370
Ah, my man.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.380
Thank you, Brazil.
Nice.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.460
Hey.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.300
Hey.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.210
We can go.
-Sorry.

21:00.210 --> 21:02.130
-That's fine.
-OK.

21:07.880 --> 21:13.310
Uh, not a bad day.
