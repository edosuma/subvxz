00:03.153 --> 00:05.462
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:11.587 --> 00:12.419
(knock on door)

00:12.571 --> 00:14.555
Hello, Austin EMS.

00:17.334 --> 00:19.226
Do you think we're too late?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.671
Oh. Hello.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.024
Did you call 9-1-1?

00:25.175 --> 00:28.252
Oh, yes. I was, uh, just, uh...

00:28.270 --> 00:30.087
I was just expecting, uh...

00:30.089 --> 00:31.363
Oh, never mind. Come on.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.682
Edith is the one
who usually calls.
Come in.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.902
How long have you had
this pain in your head, Edith?

00:37.054 --> 00:37.944
All morning.

00:38.097 --> 00:39.112
Do you have any history

00:39.189 --> 00:40.781
of migraines or seizures?

00:40.933 --> 00:42.616
-No.
-She's the healthy one.

00:42.768 --> 00:45.294
TOMMY VEGA:
Okay, I wanna
check your pupils now.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.463
First here.

00:48.198 --> 00:51.050
Okay. Here we go.

00:51.201 --> 00:53.201
-Edith, do you wear contacts?
-EDITH: I do.

00:53.279 --> 00:56.113
It's easier than trying to
remember where my readers are.

00:56.131 --> 00:57.872
Do you forget
to take 'em out sometimes?

00:57.892 --> 00:59.783
Well, they fall out.
(chuckles)

00:59.785 --> 01:02.561
Yeah, but it's not a problem
because they're disposable.

01:02.638 --> 01:04.288
TOMMY:
I don't think
they always fall out.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.399
It looks like you have
an old one stuck in there.

01:07.626 --> 01:10.127
Yeah, go ahead.
Lean your head back.

01:10.129 --> 01:12.053
-Great. TK, saline.
-TK STRAND: Mm-hmm.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.980
Alright. This might
feel a little cold.

01:14.057 --> 01:15.991
TOMMY:
Okay, Nancy, swab.

01:19.305 --> 01:20.579
Okay.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.916
-Here we go.
-Oh, heavens.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.476
Do you think
I really have two lenses in?

01:26.495 --> 01:27.586
Um...

01:28.738 --> 01:29.830
Not two.

01:29.906 --> 01:31.648
Huh.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.258
-TK: Whoa.
-Oh, my.

01:33.335 --> 01:36.261
-What?
-Okay, shh. Just be still.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.431
Uh-huh.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.159
It's like a clown car.

01:42.177 --> 01:44.645
I think I got it.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.831
Yeah, I think that's it.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.090
Nancy, bag.

01:49.168 --> 01:50.609
TK, saline.

01:53.839 --> 01:55.096
How many were in there?

01:55.174 --> 01:56.698
More than a dozen.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.450
How is that possible?

01:58.861 --> 02:00.953
Well, it's a lot more common
than you might think.

02:01.104 --> 02:02.846
They get lodged in the fornices,

02:02.865 --> 02:04.181
the area under the lid.

02:04.199 --> 02:05.349
Yeah, that's not even a record.

02:05.351 --> 02:06.792
There was a woman in the UK

02:06.869 --> 02:08.293
who had 27 removed.

02:08.445 --> 02:09.353
Oh, my goodness.

02:09.538 --> 02:12.297
-Oh, I feel so foolish.
-TOMMY: Oh, don't.

02:12.374 --> 02:14.358
-How's your pressure now?
-EDITH: Gone.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.360
-(Tommy laughs)
-Oh, my!

02:16.362 --> 02:18.862
You're a pretty thing,
aren't you?

02:18.955 --> 02:20.547
Well, you're all so pretty.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.249
TOMMY: Um, the thing
to remember, Mrs. Sullivan,

02:23.327 --> 02:26.794
about disposable lenses
is to dispose of them.

02:26.872 --> 02:28.147
-I will.
-TOMMY: Alright.

02:28.223 --> 02:29.389
Let's get her on a gurney.

02:29.466 --> 02:31.966
I'd like to take you
to St. Raymond's.

02:32.044 --> 02:33.043
Just as a follow-up.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.153
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

02:34.304 --> 02:36.971
Of course.
She's gonna be just fine.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.715
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:38.717 --> 02:39.900
(siren wailing)

02:40.052 --> 02:41.326
The hell?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.071
Paragon?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.165
Why is a private crew here?

02:46.316 --> 02:48.000
Did you call
another ambulance?

02:48.227 --> 02:50.169
-No.
-PARAMEDIC:
Nobody had to call.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.153
Saw a request
for a medical unit
to this address.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.322
We dropped everything.
Came right over.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.841
-Pearce.
-Captain Vega.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.134
EDITH (laughs):
Is that Pearcey?

02:57.994 --> 02:59.236
Oh, do you know each other?

02:59.346 --> 03:02.514
Yeah, the Sullivans are
some of our most valued clients.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.349
We usually just
refer to them as patients.

03:04.459 --> 03:07.244
Oh, these boys have
come out a few times

03:07.262 --> 03:09.246
Arthur's had his spells.

03:09.248 --> 03:10.856
So you work for Paragon now?

03:10.933 --> 03:12.024
Private sector's more efficient.

03:12.175 --> 03:14.175
-Pays more you mean?
-(scoffs)

03:14.253 --> 03:15.861
You didn't lose our number,
did you, Mrs. Sullivan?

03:16.012 --> 03:17.254
Oh, no, dear.

03:17.347 --> 03:19.256
Arthur called this time.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.516
I just used the 9-1-1.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.776
Well, we talked
about that, Arthur.

03:22.928 --> 03:23.869
It won't happen again.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.278
We can take it
from here, Captain.

03:25.431 --> 03:27.188
-Take what from here?
-I'm sure the Sullivans

03:27.208 --> 03:28.765
will be much more comfortable
in our ambulance.

03:28.784 --> 03:31.268
And we're already familiar
with their needs and conditions.

03:31.286 --> 03:33.528
Oh, then you should have
been aware that Mrs. Sullivan

03:33.605 --> 03:35.380
is suffering
from fluffy eye syndrome.

03:35.532 --> 03:38.291
We removed several
long-standing obstructions.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.385
We're taking her
to St. Ray's for a follow-up.

03:40.537 --> 03:43.204
-No need to worry.
-PEARCE RISHER:
Well, I am worried.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.039
I'm worried about
those rapid breaths.

03:45.117 --> 03:46.874
Arthur, did you take
your Warfarin today?

03:46.894 --> 03:47.951
EDITH:
Oh, yes. He takes it

03:47.970 --> 03:49.286
every morning
with his breakfast,

03:49.288 --> 03:51.045
just like you told him.

03:51.047 --> 03:53.457
I've just been worked up
about Edith.

03:53.459 --> 03:56.126
I think we should
take him to West Park now
to run some panels.

03:56.144 --> 03:58.628
But-but they're taking me
to St. Ray's.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.963
PEARCE: You could
always ride with us.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.148
You know, I think
the LED lighting
in our ambulance

04:02.301 --> 04:03.391
would be a lot easier
on your eyes.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.484
And I'll even throw in

04:04.803 --> 04:06.578
a complimentary
herbal smoothie for the ride.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.306
-Ah!
-I could really
use a smoothie.

04:09.324 --> 04:12.042
-PEARCE: Mm-hmm.
-TOMMY: Hmm.

04:17.816 --> 04:19.073
Okay, what just happened?

04:19.151 --> 04:21.985
That rat bastard
stole our patient.

04:21.987 --> 04:23.487
Can they do that?

04:23.505 --> 04:25.913
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

04:25.991 --> 04:27.007
(siren wailing)

04:27.083 --> 04:30.010
(theme music plays)

04:30.012 --> 04:32.178
In my line of work,
you make it a habit

04:32.331 --> 04:34.180
to cheat death regularly.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.108
Any of us who sign up for this

04:36.259 --> 04:38.110
know that that's
part of the deal,

04:38.186 --> 04:42.022
but what we don't
sign up for is cancer.

04:42.098 --> 04:44.766
And we would lose
20% fewer firefighters

04:44.843 --> 04:45.859
to lung cancer

04:46.011 --> 04:47.268
if we had better testing

04:47.346 --> 04:49.121
and earlier access to screening.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.864
But it takes money.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.774
And that's why
we've invited you,

04:52.851 --> 04:54.034
because you're rich.

04:54.186 --> 04:55.294
-(laughter)
-Uh...

04:55.370 --> 04:56.778
So my crew,

04:56.797 --> 04:58.038
um, will be mingling

04:58.190 --> 04:59.706
to make sure that you
have a good time

04:59.800 --> 05:01.449
and to pick your pockets.

05:01.527 --> 05:02.950
So, thank you very much
for coming

05:02.970 --> 05:04.469
and enjoy yourselves tonight.

05:04.621 --> 05:05.862
(applause)

05:05.881 --> 05:07.264
(inaudible)

05:12.554 --> 05:16.890
So what we got here
is the 126 ladder.

05:16.966 --> 05:19.133
Uh, also known
as the "ladder truck."

05:19.211 --> 05:21.302
In layman's terms,
it's due to the ladder.

05:21.380 --> 05:24.138
It's one of the items
that we got up for the bid...

05:24.158 --> 05:25.824
is a ride-along...

05:25.975 --> 05:26.900
on the ladder.

05:27.052 --> 05:28.068
Hmm.

05:28.144 --> 05:29.745
I hope you get a nice bid on it.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.073
Um, Judd, do you
wanna tell him

05:33.225 --> 05:34.407
a little bit more
about the features?

05:34.484 --> 05:36.484
-JUDD RYDER: The features?
-GRACE RYDER: Yes.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.912
Like why it may be
exciting to ride.

05:39.064 --> 05:40.339
Oh, well, uh...

05:40.490 --> 05:41.823
You said you were shot, right?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.009
Oh, in the gut.
I'd show you,
but, uh, you know,

05:44.127 --> 05:45.177
too many layers.

05:45.328 --> 05:47.070
I mean, she's practically
an action hero.

05:47.072 --> 05:49.163
They kidnapped your ex-wife?

05:49.183 --> 05:51.999
-And then me.
-Well, I'm not shocked

05:52.077 --> 05:53.927
that you'd inspire a stalker.

05:54.079 --> 05:55.169
-(laughs)
-TK: Serial killer.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.414
It was my dad
that had the stalker,

05:57.432 --> 05:59.265
which was weirdly
completely different.

05:59.342 --> 06:02.936
So it goes 0 to 60 in,
you know, under ten seconds.

06:03.088 --> 06:05.513
Uh, it does have
2,000 pounds of torque.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.924
-Wow. No kidding?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:07.926 --> 06:09.034
So, you know,

06:09.261 --> 06:10.202
basically what
you're looking at here

06:10.353 --> 06:13.372
is a 35-ton rocket ship

06:13.448 --> 06:15.098
with a hundred-foot
aerial up top.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.208
A hundred feet, huh?

06:16.359 --> 06:18.268
JUDD: Yep. Thirty-three yards.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.046
About your average night
of offense down in Houston.

06:21.123 --> 06:22.455
-(laughs)
-Huh?

06:22.608 --> 06:25.634
Our ground game is,
uh, embarrassing.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.111
I'm sorry, "our"?

06:28.113 --> 06:29.462
Baby, that's how
sports fans talk.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.223
It makes us feel like
we own the team.

06:31.299 --> 06:32.724
And what do you do, sir?

06:32.801 --> 06:34.017
I own the team.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.121
Money.
I'm sure that's
what this is all about.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.639
I mean, they cut and they cut

06:39.791 --> 06:42.475
and then they act surprised
that we're over-budget.

06:42.628 --> 06:44.236
I mean, I got a call
from the department.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.963
They want us to buy
the thinner nitrile gloves.

06:46.982 --> 06:48.055
Well, the thinner gloves
they rip,

06:48.133 --> 06:49.223
which means
we have to double-glove,

06:49.317 --> 06:52.152
which only costs more money
in the long run.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.821
I mean, if they would just
let us buy the proper gloves,

06:54.973 --> 06:57.307
then-then maybe,
maybe they wouldn't have

06:57.309 --> 07:00.752
to hire a fleet of
smoothie-slinging privateers.

07:00.904 --> 07:02.328
(laughs) I mean, right?

07:02.405 --> 07:06.149
And because
tonight's not about that...

07:06.151 --> 07:09.428
No. Tonight,
we're here for cancer.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.748
I mean, we're here
against cancer,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.976
which I am really all about.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.752
Against cancer.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.521
Would you, would you like these?

07:20.924 --> 07:23.608
Fun fact, this was actually

07:23.685 --> 07:27.595
donated by the oldest winery
in the Hill Country.

07:27.673 --> 07:28.838
The Hill Country?

07:28.857 --> 07:30.949
But it's so nuanced,
so mature.

07:31.176 --> 07:33.176
Familiar, yet unexpected.

07:33.195 --> 07:35.695
It's kinda like
reading Dostoyevsky
in the original Russian.

07:35.772 --> 07:37.104
MAN: Yes, exactly that.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.123
What did you say your name was?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.107
-Mateo.
-Mateo.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.793
Your palate is inspired.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.110
I'll be right back.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.463
My wife has my checkbook.

07:46.191 --> 07:49.025
-Babe? You read Dostoyevsky?
-Huh?

07:49.027 --> 07:50.117
I love Dostoyevsky.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.619
How have we not discussed this?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.046
Oh, because I don't.

07:53.215 --> 07:56.123
I heard Cap say that last week
while he was sipping Mescal.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.726
I thought it sounded good.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.686
Oh.

08:02.298 --> 08:05.208
Excuse me,
I'll have a tequila
when you get a second.

08:05.210 --> 08:07.043
Sure thing.
What's your label?

08:07.136 --> 08:10.197
Uh, Don Canto.
Añejo if you've got it.

08:10.899 --> 08:13.658
I don't see the Añejo.

08:13.810 --> 08:14.884
Yeah, that was a long shot.

08:14.903 --> 08:16.978
It's impossible
to find these days.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.222
Well, I do see the Reposado.

08:19.224 --> 08:20.740
-How does that sound?
-Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.209
Terrific. Thank you.

08:25.822 --> 08:27.230
Hmm. That's very generous.

08:27.249 --> 08:28.840
Consider it solidarity.

08:28.917 --> 08:31.843
-Between?
-The normal people.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.587
Oh. You think you're normal?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.497
Okay, not normal.

08:36.575 --> 08:40.076
I saw your speech,
Mr. Beat-the-Odds.

08:40.095 --> 08:41.019
You've quite the story.

08:41.096 --> 08:42.354
Yeah, well, in reality,

08:42.430 --> 08:45.749
there was a lot more puking
in-in that bathroom.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.433
I will try to avoid that one.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.935
For the record,
I don't really relish

08:49.029 --> 08:50.177
telling my cancer story,

08:50.197 --> 08:51.696
even if it is
for a room full of people

08:51.848 --> 08:53.757
with a net worth of Milan.

08:53.759 --> 08:55.182
Are you sure?

08:55.260 --> 08:56.776
'Cause I think you relish.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.702
Did you just call me vain?

08:57.854 --> 08:59.262
No, I didn't.

08:59.431 --> 09:03.458
But if you are, you're using
your vanity for a good cause.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.860
You want a lime?

09:05.937 --> 09:07.954
No, no. No lime ever.

09:08.031 --> 09:09.138
Right answer.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.940
WOMAN: Kendra! (laughs)

09:10.959 --> 09:13.218
How are you?

09:13.295 --> 09:15.036
I did not know you'd be here.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.614
Good, Mrs. Laughlin, thank you.
Jonathan.

09:17.632 --> 09:18.448
How's your family?

09:18.541 --> 09:20.541
Mom got Brett into pickleball,

09:20.561 --> 09:21.618
and he's obsessed.

09:21.787 --> 09:23.787
JONATHAN:
You're the only holdout now.

09:23.789 --> 09:24.971
Say hi to Lillian.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.439
Bye, dear.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.218
So you're not the bartender?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.446
I was on a break,
and I felt like a Pinot Grigio.

09:33.523 --> 09:35.148
Oh, so you just went
back there and got it?

09:35.224 --> 09:36.616
I take what I want.

09:38.303 --> 09:41.913
<i> ♪ Baby, baby, baby, baby ♪</i>

09:41.990 --> 09:44.541
<i> ♪ Listen what I say ♪</i>

09:45.936 --> 09:49.312
<i> ♪ Baby, baby, baby, baby ♪</i>

09:49.331 --> 09:51.815
<i> ♪ Let me have my way ♪</i>

09:51.817 --> 09:55.409
<i> ♪ I'm gonna keep on knockin'</i>
<i> till the door unlatches ♪</i>

09:55.487 --> 09:56.820
Can I make you
a drink or something?

09:56.838 --> 09:57.929
-I'm good.
-Okay.

09:58.122 --> 09:59.080
'Cause, I easily just get--

09:59.099 --> 10:00.599
Shut up
and take off your pants.

10:03.011 --> 10:04.436
(sighs)

10:05.664 --> 10:06.730
Good morning.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.944
And then this dude
just murders

10:13.096 --> 10:14.595
this defenseless old lady
in cold blood.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.949
No way. That's so messed up.
Well, what happens next?

10:18.101 --> 10:19.692
NANCY GILLIAN:
Nah-uh. You gotta read it, Teo.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.287
Hey, anybody seen a hot blond
come through here?

10:22.364 --> 10:24.347
Oh, yeah. The bartender.
You just missed her.

10:24.366 --> 10:26.791
Turns out she wasn't
the bartender.

10:26.943 --> 10:28.184
She's a billionaire heiress.

10:28.186 --> 10:31.129
An undercover heiress?
Dope.

10:31.206 --> 10:32.872
You know what?
Kendra is dope.

10:33.024 --> 10:36.801
And she's mysterious
and powerful,

10:36.878 --> 10:38.378
but with the soul of a poet.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.046
Sounds like you
really hit it off.

10:40.198 --> 10:41.714
We really did, on every level.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.883
Physically, mentally...

10:44.035 --> 10:44.959
and physically again.

10:45.036 --> 10:46.127
MATEO: Whoa.

10:46.204 --> 10:47.812
And then she gave me
the French exit.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.981
She bailed
without leaving a trace.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.132
Oh, no, she left a trace.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.692
Yeah, she left a note.

10:53.895 --> 10:55.136
A note?

10:55.213 --> 10:57.063
In an envelope
and everything.

10:57.215 --> 10:58.472
How old world.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.992
I told you
she had the soul of a poet.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.144
NANCY: What's it say?

11:03.221 --> 11:05.571
"Sorry I had to run, had fun."

11:05.724 --> 11:07.557
Hmm. At least it rhymes.

11:07.575 --> 11:08.958
What is that?

11:10.395 --> 11:12.045
OWEN STRAND:
It's a check.

11:12.898 --> 11:14.989
She paid you?

11:15.066 --> 11:16.383
(Nancy gasps)

11:23.575 --> 11:25.074
-Captain Vega, hi.
-TOMMY: Hey, Jim.

11:25.168 --> 11:26.184
-Um, is she in?
-JIM: She is.

11:26.261 --> 11:27.352
But she's busy right now.

11:27.429 --> 11:29.479
-Oh, I won't take long.
-JIM: Uh...

11:29.915 --> 11:31.172
Hey.

11:31.249 --> 11:32.840
Chief Reynolds, we have to talk.

11:32.918 --> 11:33.766
Uh, Captain Vega, can this wait?

11:34.010 --> 11:34.842
I'm kinda
in the middle of something.

11:34.936 --> 11:36.177
No, actually, it can't.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.012
Is it true the city
cut a deal with Paragon?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.698
(sighs) We didn't
wanna say anything

11:39.925 --> 11:41.199
until the press release
next week.

11:41.276 --> 11:42.516
Chief, we have to cancel it.

11:42.594 --> 11:47.263
Uh, those guys,
they're-they're greedy vampires.

11:47.265 --> 11:49.332
Who are...
They're sitting right there.

11:50.026 --> 11:51.025
Hmm.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.193
CHIEF REYNOLDS:
I believe you know

11:52.212 --> 11:55.196
Jacques Lundy,
CEO of Paragon.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.382
Captain Vega.
So lovely to see you again.

11:57.533 --> 11:58.532
Is it, though?

11:58.793 --> 12:00.218
Captain Vega and I
used to crack on each other

12:00.295 --> 12:02.128
all the time when
her team worked for me.

12:02.205 --> 12:03.704
-Those were some good times.
-TOMMY: Mm-hmm.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.966
Price gouging patients
and upselling drugs.
Oh! (chuckles)

12:07.060 --> 12:09.710
Boy, that bottom line
did okay, didn't it?

12:09.730 --> 12:12.379
Which is why your chief here
was so keen on our services.

12:12.457 --> 12:15.233
They're gonna share 35%
of their profits with the city.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.143
With the recession,
we couldn't say no.

12:17.295 --> 12:20.480
Chief, I understand
there are practical necessities,

12:20.556 --> 12:23.849
but Paragon's
code of ethics and safety,

12:23.927 --> 12:26.302
they're simply
not up to our standards.

12:26.304 --> 12:29.063
Respectfully, I disagree.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.490
Our motto, Captain Vega,

12:30.584 --> 12:32.642
is, "Elite care
and quality comfort."

12:32.660 --> 12:35.420
Look, it's right there
on our business card.

12:36.982 --> 12:38.757
Alright. Chief.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.149
Look, I know it might feel like

12:40.151 --> 12:41.909
we're horning in
on your territory,

12:41.961 --> 12:44.411
but there are emergencies
to go around.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.506
Paragon's response times
are impeccable.

12:46.582 --> 12:47.991
Our equipment
is state-of-the-art,

12:47.993 --> 12:50.510
and our paramedics are ballers.

12:50.662 --> 12:53.772
I think you all could make
one heck of a team.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.331
Thank you so much, Dottie.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.349
-That means the world.
-(mouths) Yeah.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.184
JACQUES:
Captain Vega, you have my word.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.195
We're here to help.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.338
TOMMY:
<i> They're trying to kill us.</i>

13:02.357 --> 13:05.116
Paragon has partnered
with city EMS

13:05.268 --> 13:07.010
three times in the past.

13:07.012 --> 13:09.270
Tulsa, Abilene, and Shreveport.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.956
Two of them went
fully private within a year.

13:12.033 --> 13:13.107
So how do we stop it?

13:13.184 --> 13:14.517
Well, we do what Shreveport did.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.962
We respond to more calls
and try to beat them there.

13:18.114 --> 13:20.281
-Keep them from
getting a foothold.
-Exactly.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.525
OWEN: I resent that.
And I resent the comparison.

13:22.527 --> 13:23.468
Oh, my God.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.452
Who doesn't like being
compared to Richard Gere?

13:25.530 --> 13:27.138
I don't. Particularly
when it comes to

13:27.290 --> 13:29.641
exchanging cash
for romantic favors.

13:29.717 --> 13:30.975
Oh, we got a live one!

13:31.168 --> 13:33.052
-(laughter)
-Ooh, I say.

13:33.204 --> 13:35.814
Who is exchanging money
for romantic favors?

13:36.041 --> 13:37.223
A gentleman never discloses.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.984
It was the bartender.
Yes, it was that bartender!

13:40.136 --> 13:41.210
Cap, I saw you
cozying up to her.

13:41.229 --> 13:42.378
Yo, she was a working girl?

13:42.397 --> 13:45.139
Hey, my dad would
never have to pay, okay?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.141
-Thank you, son.
-That bartender

13:47.218 --> 13:49.810
has more money
than God, apparently.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.479
Okay, then why'd he say
Cap had to go all
<i> Pretty Woman</i> on her?

13:52.574 --> 13:54.240
No, I wasn't saying
<i> Pretty Woman</i> Richard Gere.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.650
I was saying<i> American Gigolo</i>
Richard Gere.

13:56.728 --> 13:57.743
JUDD: So hold up.

13:57.896 --> 13:58.578
She paid you?

13:58.730 --> 13:59.896
OWEN: No. No.

13:59.989 --> 14:03.324
But would that be
such an unimaginable situation?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.251
JUDD: Well, who is
this gal, anyway?

14:05.403 --> 14:07.086
Her name is Kendra Harrington.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.495
You say Harrington?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.589
Wow!

14:09.665 --> 14:10.664
The Harringtons own

14:10.758 --> 14:12.241
half of the land
in the Permian Basin.

14:12.260 --> 14:15.745
So, ol' big daddy really knows
how to pick a sugar mama.

14:15.763 --> 14:16.837
(laughter)

14:16.857 --> 14:18.857
She's not a sugar mama.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.750
She didn't pay for anything.

14:20.768 --> 14:23.194
She made a very
generous donation
to Stand Up To Cancer.

14:23.271 --> 14:26.030
Yeah, except the check
wasn't made out to charity.

14:26.107 --> 14:29.092
The check was made out
to Owen Strand.

14:29.110 --> 14:30.702
She obviously
meant for me to cash it.

14:30.778 --> 14:31.928
JUDD: Okay.

14:31.946 --> 14:33.946
So what'd she put
in the memo line?

14:34.023 --> 14:35.598
-Who uses the memo line?
-Alright.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.043
Well, just how generous
are we talking here?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.119
Hundred thousand dollars.

14:40.196 --> 14:41.862
-ALL: Ooh!
-(laughter)

14:41.940 --> 14:45.274
Look, Kendra
is a very pure,
philanthropic woman,

14:45.293 --> 14:48.294
and I will not have
her motives besmirched.

14:48.446 --> 14:50.704
Also, a woman
who looks like that
does not need to pay for sex.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.391
-(cell phone chimes)
-Oh, and she's
texting me right now.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.209
-MATEO CHAVEZ: Hmm.
-TK: What's she saying?

14:55.228 --> 14:58.137
"Let's get together again.
Are you avail?"

14:58.214 --> 15:00.381
Did she say "avail"
or "available"?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.883
'Cause that sounds like
how I text my hairdresser.

15:02.903 --> 15:07.388
-Oh.
-Yes, I am avail-able tomorrow.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.315
(pops lips) Alright. I know
what you guys are thinking

15:09.392 --> 15:12.911
and I am gonna get to
the bottom of this check mix-up

15:12.987 --> 15:14.579
because I may be easy,

15:14.656 --> 15:18.082
but no one,
and I mean no one,
has to pay for it.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.900
That sounded
a lot better in my head.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.295
(laughter)

15:24.165 --> 15:27.300
(upbeat music playing)

15:33.825 --> 15:35.224
MAN: This seat taken?

15:36.511 --> 15:37.560
Go ahead.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.523
(music ends)

15:45.670 --> 15:47.779
I don't mean to intrude,
but is everything okay?

15:47.930 --> 15:49.405
I'm fine. Thanks.

15:54.696 --> 15:55.662
Thank you.

16:00.852 --> 16:01.960
I got laid off today.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.036
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:04.189 --> 16:07.448
Seven years I did the books,
made the coffee,

16:07.525 --> 16:09.358
but they got some
new accounting software.

16:09.377 --> 16:11.469
Now they don't
need me anymore.

16:11.546 --> 16:13.120
(voice breaking)
I feel so useless.

16:13.198 --> 16:15.390
No, you're not.

16:16.125 --> 16:18.384
Look, I don't know you,

16:18.536 --> 16:21.688
but believe me,
you are not useless.

16:23.799 --> 16:27.986
You know, these hot pants
aren't a fashion statement.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.045
(woman chuckles)

16:29.063 --> 16:32.490
It's a, uh, dialysis catheter.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.384
Treatments five times a week
for a year now.

16:35.445 --> 16:38.479
Nobody tells you kidney failure
comes with hot pants.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.740
I'm sorry
you're going through that.

16:40.816 --> 16:42.208
I appreciate that.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.319
Honestly, it sucks.

16:45.396 --> 16:48.006
I can't play soccer with my son.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.233
Go swimming.

16:50.251 --> 16:53.177
For a while, I...
I wanted to give up.

16:53.329 --> 16:54.904
But I'm glad I didn't.

16:54.997 --> 16:56.756
I found an organ donor
last week.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.182
That's amazing.

16:58.259 --> 17:00.092
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

17:00.245 --> 17:02.245
New kidney goes in next month,

17:02.263 --> 17:03.913
then I'm back in denim.

17:03.915 --> 17:05.339
(both chuckle)

17:05.358 --> 17:07.767
That's great. Even though
you do rock the hot pants.

17:07.919 --> 17:08.860
Well...

17:09.011 --> 17:10.920
I'm Martha.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.572
-Dan.
-(Martha chuckles)

17:18.038 --> 17:20.763
(upbeat music continues)

17:20.782 --> 17:21.947
Ma'am, take my seat.

17:22.024 --> 17:23.041
I insist.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.043
-Um...
-Excuse me, sir.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.461
-I just need to...
-DAN: Yeah.

17:28.773 --> 17:29.881
(Dan groans)

17:30.032 --> 17:31.674
(people screaming)

17:33.111 --> 17:34.460
Oh, no.

17:34.537 --> 17:35.428
Dan?

25:06.339 --> 25:08.247
It's not a test.
I'm just feeling her out.

25:08.399 --> 25:10.508
And seeing
if she pays you for it.

25:10.584 --> 25:12.251
I would never stoop
to something so crass.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.011
So how do you plan to do it?

25:14.088 --> 25:17.698
With a delicate dance
of nuance and subtext.

25:17.700 --> 25:18.682
I am going to engage her

25:18.909 --> 25:21.519
in a deep,
sophisticated conversation.

25:21.521 --> 25:25.247
And then I'm gonna ask her
to some highbrow event, or two.

25:25.266 --> 25:27.191
And if there's
something real between us,

25:27.268 --> 25:29.175
she'll say yes,
and if she brushes me off,

25:29.195 --> 25:30.844
I'll know that
she just sees me as a...

25:30.863 --> 25:33.422
-A himbo.
-Well, I don't love
that term, but, yes.

25:33.424 --> 25:36.091
Oh. The good news is
I've already got my first clue,

25:36.110 --> 25:36.925
and it looks encouraging.

25:36.944 --> 25:38.184
What clue is that?

25:38.353 --> 25:41.113
She said she's bringing over
Austin's best cuisine.

25:41.189 --> 25:43.615
And why would she do that
if it were just about sex?

25:43.768 --> 25:45.617
I mean, I saw on a show
that the Sultan of Brunei

25:45.694 --> 25:48.103
flew in soba noodles
from Okinawa for his girls.

25:48.105 --> 25:50.047
I once knew a hostess
on the Upper West Side

25:50.198 --> 25:51.882
who was flown there regularly.

25:51.959 --> 25:53.217
She never mentioned the food.

25:53.444 --> 25:55.368
Oh, yeah.
Lobsters from Maine,

25:55.388 --> 25:58.797
a chef from Cordon Bleu,
you name it.

25:58.874 --> 25:59.873
I'm just saying, the subtext

25:59.892 --> 26:01.392
with these high rollers
can get tricky.

26:01.543 --> 26:04.544
Yeah. And then I'm gonna
just offhandedly ask her

26:04.564 --> 26:07.047
if she meant to
write the check to charity.

26:07.124 --> 26:08.140
Offhandedly ask her?

26:08.292 --> 26:09.549
Yeah, I'm gonna slip it in.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.550
-Whoa.
-Um...

26:10.628 --> 26:11.551
To the conversation.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.979
Cap, why don't you just
ask her straight out?

26:14.131 --> 26:15.221
"Do you think I'm a gigolo?"

26:15.299 --> 26:17.074
No one uses the phrase "gigolo."

26:17.151 --> 26:19.243
It's sex worker, and there's
nothing wrong with it.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.727
So why are you
so afraid to ask?

26:20.821 --> 26:22.395
Because it would be uncouth.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.807
Well, Dostoyevsky said that,
"The fear of appearances

26:24.825 --> 26:25.974
is the first sign of impotence."

26:25.993 --> 26:27.251
Dostoyevsky, huh?

26:27.402 --> 26:28.994
Nancy's got me ear-reading
<i> Crime and Punishment.</i>

26:29.146 --> 26:30.495
I'm trying to finish it
before I see her tomorrow.

26:30.648 --> 26:31.496
(doorbell rings)

26:31.740 --> 26:33.239
Well, finish it upstairs
'cause that's her.

26:33.334 --> 26:36.151
-Wish me luck.
-I think you're good
for at least 100 grand.

26:36.153 --> 26:37.595
-Get the hell outta here.
-(Mateo laughs)

26:40.007 --> 26:42.157
Kendra.
You look amazing. Come in.

26:42.176 --> 26:44.009
Not so bad yourself.

26:44.161 --> 26:45.177
And you brought...

26:45.329 --> 26:48.397
Burgers from Artie's.
It's my favorite.

26:50.351 --> 26:51.525
Oh, my God.

26:53.095 --> 26:55.504
-Is that Limoges China?
-Yeah.

26:55.522 --> 26:58.264
Oh, I'm totally disappointing
you right now, aren't I?

26:58.284 --> 27:00.175
-No, no, no, no, no.
-I'm so sorry.

27:00.194 --> 27:01.118
No, no, no, no, no.
No, please.

27:01.195 --> 27:02.177
Burgers are way better

27:02.196 --> 27:03.996
than soba noodles from Okinawa.

27:04.849 --> 27:06.272
So oddly specific.

27:06.350 --> 27:08.959
No, I, uh, I love
a good, cheap burger

27:09.036 --> 27:11.277
as long as it's not commentary.

27:11.355 --> 27:14.965
Don't worry.
There's one thing
I know for sure.

27:15.117 --> 27:16.333
You're no cheap date.

27:16.485 --> 27:17.968
Ooh. What's that
supposed to mean?

27:18.120 --> 27:19.711
-What?
-Cheap date.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.788
Why the economic qualifier?

27:21.866 --> 27:23.456
(laughs) Nothing.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.809
-Owen, what's going on?
-You know, I...

27:25.886 --> 27:28.562
There's-there's something
I need to talk to you about.

27:30.799 --> 27:32.024
What is it?

27:33.986 --> 27:34.985
Miró.

27:35.137 --> 27:37.546
As in Miró
the surrealist artist?

27:37.548 --> 27:39.406
Yes. What are
your thoughts on him?

27:40.567 --> 27:42.050
Um... (laughs)

27:42.052 --> 27:44.144
I love him, actually.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.664
The way his style
straddles the tension

27:46.740 --> 27:48.332
between whimsy and...

27:48.483 --> 27:51.001
The harsh realities
of modern life?

27:51.153 --> 27:52.744
-Exactly.
-See...

27:52.897 --> 27:54.730
I knew you'd get that.

27:54.748 --> 27:58.583
Tonight, there is
a special Miró exhibit
at the Contemporary,

27:58.660 --> 28:02.905
and I thought we'd have
our burgers, and then we go.

28:02.923 --> 28:08.001
I don't know.
I was kinda hoping
we could stay in tonight.

28:08.078 --> 28:09.912
So just like last time?

28:09.914 --> 28:11.914
I mean, maybe
with a little variation,

28:11.932 --> 28:14.599
but overall,
it totally worked for me.

28:14.752 --> 28:17.343
Well, I'm glad
you're a satisfied customer.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.937
KENDRA:
That's one way to put it.

28:20.591 --> 28:23.992
Let me ask you,
wh-what is your philosophy
on the memo line?

28:24.929 --> 28:25.928
The what?

28:25.930 --> 28:27.262
-(Buttercup panting)
-Oh, hey.

28:27.264 --> 28:29.707
-Oh, my God. Who is this?
-Hey, boy.

28:29.783 --> 28:30.933
This is Buttercup.

28:30.951 --> 28:31.950
He-he's a shameless beggar,

28:32.027 --> 28:33.860
but he is a good boy.

28:33.938 --> 28:36.121
Hi, buddy.
Aw, he's beautiful.

28:36.273 --> 28:37.956
-Yeah.
-How old is he?

28:38.033 --> 28:40.384
They weren't able
to tell me at the rescue.

28:40.535 --> 28:45.055
I'm sorry.
You-you rescued a full-breed
Bernese Mountain Dog?

28:45.132 --> 28:47.040
Who leaves
one of these guys in the pound?

28:47.134 --> 28:48.242
Oh, it wasn't a pound.

28:48.244 --> 28:49.226
It was an organization

28:49.377 --> 28:51.729
that takes care of dogs
with cancer.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.065
Wow. Just when I thought
you couldn't get any more sexy,

28:55.142 --> 28:57.568
you go and adopt a cancer dog.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.656
OWEN: Mm.

29:03.968 --> 29:06.744
You know what?
Let's slow play tonight.

29:06.937 --> 29:08.203
Shut up and kiss me.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.827
Oh, you're just making one cup.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.087
Uh, Kendra left around 2:00 A.M.

29:17.164 --> 29:19.339
-A.M.?
-Yeah?

29:20.167 --> 29:21.759
And you seem weirdly happy.

29:21.835 --> 29:23.093
Why wouldn't I be?

29:23.245 --> 29:26.321
We had a great time,
and no monies were exchanged.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.413
Oh, so no himbo.

29:27.674 --> 29:29.324
No, it just confirms what
I knew from the start.

29:29.326 --> 29:31.009
That Kendra,
on top of being

29:31.161 --> 29:33.771
a beautiful
and overscheduled woman,

29:33.847 --> 29:35.180
has an enormous heart.

29:35.332 --> 29:37.833
And I think that
she recognizes that in me.

29:37.835 --> 29:42.854
She sees me, Mateo,
in a way that
no one has in years.

29:42.931 --> 29:45.032
And is our connection physical?

29:45.451 --> 29:46.508
Yes, very.

29:46.768 --> 29:48.860
But also, I think
that we're drawn together

29:48.937 --> 29:52.956
because we're
citizens of the world,
and kindred spirits.

29:53.108 --> 29:55.017
All this happened
and I didn't even finish

29:55.019 --> 29:56.351
three chapters
of<i> Crime and Punishment.</i>

29:56.370 --> 29:58.444
Well, it's Dostoyevsky.
They're long chapters.

29:58.522 --> 30:00.297
(cash register dings
over cell phone)

30:02.042 --> 30:03.449
-MATEO: That her?
-Yeah.

30:03.527 --> 30:05.677
Why is her text sound
a cash register?

30:08.032 --> 30:09.031
It's a Venmo payment.

30:09.049 --> 30:10.599
Another 100 grand?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.685
Forty thousand dollars
this time.

30:14.721 --> 30:15.871
Customer loyalty discount.

30:15.964 --> 30:18.315
♪ ♪

30:31.163 --> 30:33.238
JUDD:
What's up, man?
You doing origami now?

30:33.332 --> 30:36.408
Oh, please. I've been
an origamist since 1982.

30:36.484 --> 30:40.153
Nah, I'm just trying
to work up my nerve to...

30:40.247 --> 30:42.172
throw away this check
that Kendra gave me.

30:42.324 --> 30:45.158
So, I guess the second date
wasn't a home run.

30:45.252 --> 30:46.343
Oh, God.
It was a grand slam.

30:46.420 --> 30:50.347
Bringing my earnings
to a total of 140K.

30:50.498 --> 30:54.017
But she did fill out
the memo line this time.

30:54.169 --> 30:56.019
What's that?
Is that some kind of emoji?

30:56.171 --> 30:58.856
A bone emoji.
Subtle, huh?

30:59.007 --> 31:00.173
I mean, it's kinda clever.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.600
I'm nothing but a cheap himbo.

31:01.752 --> 31:04.586
Hey, there ain't
nothin' cheap
about $140,000.

31:04.605 --> 31:06.679
I mean, most men would be
a little bit proud of that.

31:06.699 --> 31:09.199
Well, I have to admit,
it was a bit of an ego boost,

31:09.276 --> 31:12.202
but mostly just bummed me out
'cause I really liked her.

31:12.279 --> 31:14.037
I thought
we might have something.

31:14.114 --> 31:15.447
(cell phone buzzing)

31:15.523 --> 31:16.522
Oh, she's calling me again.

31:16.783 --> 31:20.377
Well, you can keep your cash,
Miss Harrington.

31:21.029 --> 31:22.454
You sure?

31:22.606 --> 31:24.122
I mean, the firehouse
needs a new smoker.

31:24.274 --> 31:25.290
(laughs sarcastically)

31:25.442 --> 31:26.608
Hey, I'm only
halfway kidding, man.

31:26.627 --> 31:28.443
I mean, hell,
you may feel a little queasy,

31:28.462 --> 31:31.388
but every one of those zeros
could save a life.

31:31.539 --> 31:32.447
That is true.

31:32.616 --> 31:35.225
So why don't you
get over yourself

31:35.302 --> 31:37.644
and give that money to charity?

31:39.289 --> 31:41.315
As long as
it saves a life, right?

31:41.959 --> 31:43.233
Yeah.

31:52.136 --> 31:54.661
(siren wailing)

31:59.493 --> 32:03.328
According to dispatch,
this place is a perfume factory.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.738
We're looking at a possible
airborne toxic event,

32:05.758 --> 32:07.907
so keep your rebreathers handy.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.484
If this is a perfume factory,

32:09.486 --> 32:11.319
why does it
smell like Thanksgiving?

32:11.321 --> 32:13.321
Oh, the 122 Fire has landed,

32:13.323 --> 32:15.674
but it looks like we beat
their medical team here.

32:15.750 --> 32:18.584
Unfortunately,
someone else beat us here.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.770
Paragon.

32:19.921 --> 32:21.605
My eyes felt scratchy,

32:21.756 --> 32:23.106
and the next thing I know,

32:23.183 --> 32:24.590
some of my guys
started getting dizzy.

32:24.668 --> 32:27.018
We got everybody out,
but it was scary.

32:27.095 --> 32:28.853
Yeah. Does the company
provide insurance?

32:29.006 --> 32:31.006
HMO, I think, with Incise.

32:31.008 --> 32:34.117
Excellent.
One of our preferred partners.

32:34.269 --> 32:35.768
Okay, head over there,
let my team check you out.

32:35.846 --> 32:39.439
And tell your guys I got
more teams coming in to help.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.018
So any word
on what kinda chemicals
might be leaking in there?

32:43.020 --> 32:45.278
Not yet.
Hazmat's inside right now

32:45.355 --> 32:47.280
with toxic gas monitors
trying to figure that out.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.799
Okay. Well, how can we help?

32:48.875 --> 32:50.041
You're on hydration detail.

32:50.194 --> 32:51.951
Is that meant
to be payback?

32:52.045 --> 32:53.195
Real mature, dude.

32:53.197 --> 32:54.972
Guys, we're talking to our IC.

32:55.048 --> 32:56.306
That's not a problem.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.308
We'll grab some waters
and then pass 'em out

32:58.385 --> 33:00.310
while we help your guys
triage the workers.

33:00.387 --> 33:01.311
The workers? No.

33:01.463 --> 33:02.871
You're not going
near the workers.

33:02.889 --> 33:03.981
They belong to us.

33:04.057 --> 33:05.540
Well, who are the waters for?

33:05.559 --> 33:06.725
(clicks tongue)

33:06.801 --> 33:08.276
The looky-loos.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.655
(chuckles softly)

33:11.732 --> 33:12.731
<i> Qué hijo de nadie.</i>

33:12.807 --> 33:14.408
No, he did not.

33:15.235 --> 33:16.827
TOMMY: Here you go, sir.

33:16.978 --> 33:17.977
Try not to lock your knees.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.721
Can't have anybody keeling over.

33:19.740 --> 33:22.724
I don't know how you could
just nod and smile at that guy.

33:22.726 --> 33:25.894
I don't know how you don't
punch him in his stupid face.

33:25.912 --> 33:27.746
He is insufferable.
There you go.

33:27.898 --> 33:29.397
But he's good at his job.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.841
I mean, without him
we wouldn't have saved

33:30.992 --> 33:33.326
that patient's life on the bus.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.179
But what if he's...
so good at his job

33:36.331 --> 33:39.182
that Paragon
puts us out of business?

33:39.259 --> 33:43.928
Then we help as many people
as we can for as long as we can.

33:43.930 --> 33:46.523
HAZMAT OFFICER (over radio):
<i> All units, we found</i>
<i> the source of the leak.</i>

33:46.674 --> 33:49.768
<i> Looks like it's just</i>
<i> a spilled drum of isoeugenol.</i>

33:49.920 --> 33:52.937
<i> Substance is</i>
<i> secure and structure</i>
<i> is cleared for use.</i>

33:53.014 --> 33:54.439
Thank God. False alarm.

33:54.591 --> 33:56.107
-(Tommy chuckles)
-What did he say?

33:56.184 --> 33:58.017
-Isoe-what?
-TOMMY: Isoeugenol.

33:58.095 --> 34:00.262
It's, uh,
extract of essential oils.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.264
Actually, it smells
a lot like pumpkin pie.

34:02.282 --> 34:03.932
Told you it smelled
like Thanksgiving.

34:03.950 --> 34:05.950
Dude. What are you,
part basset hound?

34:06.027 --> 34:07.360
(TK laughs)

34:07.379 --> 34:08.545
TK: Oh, uh, Cap?

34:08.939 --> 34:11.364
If it was a false alarm,
why is he taking that guy in?

34:11.441 --> 34:14.459
Probably so he can ring up
their premium insurance plan.

34:14.536 --> 34:16.444
-I have to say something.
-No, Nancy.

34:16.446 --> 34:19.872
No, I have to, because this
is gross and grand larceny.

34:19.950 --> 34:20.891
And maybe you can stand here--

34:21.042 --> 34:23.393
Alright, okay.
Just let me do it.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.564
Paramedic Risher,
uh, is he okay?

34:27.715 --> 34:29.549
Well, he had the most
exposure of anyone in there.

34:29.568 --> 34:34.220
Exposure to a giant bucket
of glorified pumpkin spice?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.981
-You're way outta line, Captain.
-No, you're out of line, son.

34:37.058 --> 34:38.891
We both know this man
doesn't need a hospital.

34:38.911 --> 34:42.654
Son?
Try Incident Commander.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.823
You're right. I'm sorry.

34:44.899 --> 34:46.199
I shouldn't have called you son.

34:47.494 --> 34:50.754
I should have called you
a profiteering sociopath.

34:50.905 --> 34:52.089
You also forgot sellout.

34:52.165 --> 34:54.649
And coward!

34:54.668 --> 34:58.095
Nice. Well, you'll all
be hearing from the chief.

34:58.246 --> 34:59.596
Enjoy your suspension.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.179
So that was
totally worth it, right?

35:08.332 --> 35:09.831
-Oh, totally worth it.
-Totally worth it.

35:09.833 --> 35:13.110
NANCY:
So what are your guys
new career paths gonna be

35:13.261 --> 35:15.186
once Paragon owns our souls?

35:15.339 --> 35:18.657
Oh, I hear
San Marcos EMS is hiring.

35:19.676 --> 35:21.618
(explosion)

35:27.960 --> 35:29.367
(panting)

35:29.519 --> 35:30.201
Gurney!

35:30.295 --> 35:32.462
Nancy, LIFEPAK, trauma shears.

35:39.212 --> 35:41.471
Alright, Pearce, we got you.
Hang in there!

35:47.980 --> 35:49.729
TK: Okay. Come on!

35:52.042 --> 35:53.725
Pearce. Hey.

35:53.801 --> 35:55.193
Stay with me, okay?

35:58.824 --> 36:00.398
His jugular's distended.

36:00.550 --> 36:03.142
I do not like the look
of his chest rise.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.402
O2's 80s and falling.

36:04.554 --> 36:07.055
Lung sounds are diminished
on the right side,

36:07.057 --> 36:08.223
nothing on the left.

36:08.225 --> 36:09.315
He can barely draw a breath.

36:09.393 --> 36:10.408
TOMMY: That's blast lung.

36:10.410 --> 36:11.835
His left lung
must have ruptured.

36:12.062 --> 36:13.745
His pleural cavity's
filling with air.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.005
We need to decompress his chest.

36:15.156 --> 36:16.231
You wanna do
a thoracostomy here?

36:16.249 --> 36:18.008
We don't have a choice.

36:18.159 --> 36:20.068
I'm gonna need a scalpel
and a Kelly Clamp.

36:20.086 --> 36:22.387
-NANCY: Copy.
-(Pearce groaning)

36:23.498 --> 36:25.974
Just hang in there.
We got you.

36:30.931 --> 36:32.397
(wheezing)

36:34.100 --> 36:35.525
TOMMY: Scalpel.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.694
This is gonna pinch.

36:39.013 --> 36:40.530
(Pearce groans sharply)

36:42.108 --> 36:44.517
Gonna add a little pressure.

36:44.594 --> 36:46.328
(groaning)

36:47.948 --> 36:49.456
-TOMMY: There we go.
-Almost done.

36:52.452 --> 36:53.210
(groans)

36:53.528 --> 36:55.027
-There it is.
-(Pearce sighs deeply)

36:55.047 --> 36:57.105
Okay. Alright.

36:57.123 --> 36:58.273
Occlusion dressing.

36:58.275 --> 37:00.108
-Cap... Captain--
-(Tommy shushing)

37:00.126 --> 37:01.426
No. Try not to talk.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.595
Thank you.

37:05.873 --> 37:07.474
You're welcome. Now shut up.

37:09.469 --> 37:10.560
Alright.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.563
TOMMY: Let's go.

37:17.627 --> 37:21.905
-...ninety-five, ninety-six,
ninety... Don't...
-(Buttercup whines)

37:21.982 --> 37:23.240
Don't you whine at me.

37:23.391 --> 37:26.150
This is the only way
to keep your luxurious sheen.

37:26.303 --> 37:27.893
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight--

37:27.946 --> 37:29.371
(knock on door)

37:30.082 --> 37:31.665
(Buttercup whines)

37:35.829 --> 37:37.069
Hi.

37:37.089 --> 37:38.997
You haven't been
returning my calls.

37:39.149 --> 37:40.832
Or my many texts.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.051
-Yeah, um...
-Can I come in?

37:43.820 --> 37:44.761
Sure.

37:46.247 --> 37:48.323
I brought you something.

37:48.341 --> 37:52.827
Don Canto.
That's the añejo that is
almost impossible to find.

37:52.846 --> 37:54.562
Keyword, "almost."

37:55.941 --> 37:57.357
You know what?

37:57.834 --> 37:59.200
Keep it.

37:59.260 --> 38:01.503
-But it's a gift.
-I think we both know

38:01.521 --> 38:02.946
that your gifts
come with strings.

38:03.023 --> 38:04.889
Well, it's a bow, actually.

38:04.966 --> 38:06.024
Don't be cute.
You know what I mean.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.768
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.453
Really?

38:10.605 --> 38:14.032
Okay, I'm talking about
the world's oldest profession.

38:14.184 --> 38:16.184
Yeah, I'm talking
about sex work.

38:16.202 --> 38:18.545
Pay for play,
money for the honey.

38:19.873 --> 38:22.114
Um... Okay.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.542
I-I-I think, um,

38:24.619 --> 38:27.211
our wires might have
gotten crossed here.

38:27.288 --> 38:29.864
Is it a rich girl fantasy?

38:29.883 --> 38:33.051
You know, buy yourself a fireman
for some blue-collar fun.

38:33.127 --> 38:35.961
'Cause if it is, I get it.
But it's not really--

38:36.039 --> 38:38.398
My brother died of lung cancer.

38:39.042 --> 38:40.375
Oh.

38:40.393 --> 38:43.878
He, um, stopped smoking
when he was 24,

38:43.897 --> 38:47.139
but still got him at 40.

38:47.217 --> 38:48.974
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.244
It's a cause
that runs deep for me.

38:52.331 --> 38:55.314
That's why I made
all those donations.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.559
O-okay. But you made
the check out to me.

38:57.561 --> 38:59.911
Yeah, 'cause I never thought
you would assume that...

39:00.063 --> 39:01.245
(laughs)

39:01.398 --> 39:02.564
Oh, my God.

39:02.899 --> 39:06.084
Owen, do you, do you really
think I need to pay for sex?

39:06.160 --> 39:08.470
Well, no, I mean,
obviously not.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.181
-I don't know.
-KENDRA: Owen...

39:11.332 --> 39:13.165
in what
bronzer-soaked universe

39:13.185 --> 39:17.078
would I spend $100,000
to sleep with you?

39:17.097 --> 39:19.247
A hundred
and forty thousand all in.

39:19.265 --> 39:20.748
And I do seem to remember

39:20.750 --> 39:23.768
you saying something about
being a satisfied customer.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.770
Mm, no, you said that.

39:25.922 --> 39:27.088
You're right, I did. Okay.

39:27.181 --> 39:28.272
But I'm not the one who Venmo'd

39:28.425 --> 39:30.091
someone with a bone emoji.

39:30.110 --> 39:33.094
It was a dog bone
for your dog charity.

39:33.113 --> 39:35.187
The picture was
an unspecified bone.

39:35.265 --> 39:38.116
I thought I was being clever.

39:38.192 --> 39:40.451
I met you while you were
throwing a benefit gala.

39:40.528 --> 39:42.212
How was I supposed to know
you were just talking

39:42.363 --> 39:44.881
and not reaching your hand out?

39:45.032 --> 39:47.717
Ugh, this always happens.

39:47.869 --> 39:49.368
"This always happens"?

39:49.446 --> 39:53.114
Not being accused
of solicitation "this."

39:53.133 --> 39:55.392
The money finds a way
to ruin everything "this."

39:55.468 --> 39:58.786
My whole life, I never know
if people like me for me

39:58.788 --> 40:00.972
or if they want something.

40:01.124 --> 40:03.233
My sweet 16,
half the girls left

40:03.384 --> 40:05.309
when we ran out
of Hermes gift bags.

40:05.887 --> 40:07.295
-Hmm.
-I know.

40:07.297 --> 40:08.630
Poor little rich girl.

40:08.632 --> 40:10.965
I don't care
about your money, Kendra.

40:11.058 --> 40:13.635
-Yeah, people always say that.
-OWEN: Okay.

40:13.637 --> 40:14.986
How about this?

40:15.062 --> 40:17.205
Next time we...

40:17.974 --> 40:19.140
it'll be on the house.

40:19.159 --> 40:20.158
KENDRA: Wow.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.976
Somebody's feeling generous.

40:21.995 --> 40:23.978
No, no, no, no, no.
You... (laughs)

40:23.997 --> 40:25.547
You're the one who's generous.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.241
Seriously, though,
if the money is an issue,

40:29.261 --> 40:30.668
we can tear up that check.

40:30.820 --> 40:31.928
Oh. Oh, no, no. Let's...

40:32.005 --> 40:33.388
Let's not get crazy.

40:37.844 --> 40:39.827
(knock on door)

40:39.846 --> 40:42.087
May I come in?

40:42.165 --> 40:44.423
Come to kick a sellout
while he's down?

40:44.501 --> 40:47.193
I, uh... Karma's taught me
better than that.

40:48.021 --> 40:49.504
You know, I lost an eyebrow.

40:49.506 --> 40:50.505
TOMMY: I see that.

40:50.765 --> 40:54.325
It'll grow back,
and it's, it's not that bad.

40:54.861 --> 40:55.785
I look hideous.

40:55.937 --> 40:58.663
No. No, you look, um...

41:00.033 --> 41:01.458
inquisitive.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.186
So why are you here?

41:05.188 --> 41:08.189
I just came to check
on how you were and...

41:08.208 --> 41:10.525
and see how
that incision is healing.

41:10.543 --> 41:14.045
Thoracic surgeon
said it was an exquisite cut.

41:14.121 --> 41:16.214
-Hmm.
-She said
you missed your calling.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.975
I told her she was wrong.

41:19.126 --> 41:20.727
You're doing exactly
what you're meant to.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.538
That's sweet.

41:23.556 --> 41:24.981
Thank you.

41:25.208 --> 41:28.876
Uh, so maybe you won't sue?

41:28.895 --> 41:30.895
Oh, no, I'm definitely suing.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.322
Just not you.

41:32.473 --> 41:33.305
Then who?

41:33.383 --> 41:35.066
JACQUES:
He lives. (laughs)

41:35.218 --> 41:37.401
How you feeling, superstar?

41:37.554 --> 41:40.312
-Extra crispy.
-JACQUES: Hilarious.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.499
Well, I've got just the thing
to make you feel better.

41:43.150 --> 41:44.149
Arabian aloe vera,

41:44.151 --> 41:46.077
essential oil diffuser,

41:46.153 --> 41:49.080
a thousand-dollar spa day
for when you get sprung.

41:49.156 --> 41:51.508
Had my assistant go all out.
No big deal.

41:51.584 --> 41:53.993
Whatever else you need,
by the way, you let me know.

41:54.070 --> 41:55.236
Hmm.

41:55.255 --> 41:57.088
How about $15 million?

41:57.164 --> 41:59.164
-Yeah.
-No, no, no, no.

41:59.242 --> 42:02.076
No, you know what?
Let's make it an even 20.

42:02.095 --> 42:03.478
I want a schooner.

42:04.264 --> 42:05.188
JACQUES: A schooner?

42:05.339 --> 42:07.915
Did they do
something to his meds?

42:07.917 --> 42:09.192
I'm suing you, Jacques.

42:09.269 --> 42:11.844
I'm going to sue you
for everything you're worth

42:11.863 --> 42:13.755
and then some.

42:13.773 --> 42:16.424
Okay, look, I know you're upset,

42:16.442 --> 42:18.259
but what happened
was an accident.

42:18.261 --> 42:21.186
No, what happened
was the O2 regulator sparked

42:21.264 --> 42:23.264
when I switched
to the rig's supply.

42:23.283 --> 42:25.283
The refurbished O2 regulator,

42:25.435 --> 42:27.118
which I complained about
on multiple occasions,

42:27.270 --> 42:29.194
along with our CPAP
and ECMO machines.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.863
Well, if he voiced
a complaint,

42:30.940 --> 42:32.382
then that
constitutes negligence.

42:32.458 --> 42:35.385
He complains a lot,
so it's tough to keep track.

42:35.461 --> 42:38.054
I wouldn't worry about that.
I've got each one documented.

42:38.131 --> 42:39.630
TOMMY:
So you guys
have been rolling

42:39.707 --> 42:42.892
with shoddy,
second-hand equipment
all this time?

42:42.969 --> 42:45.395
Yeah, it's all part of
Paragon's secret sauce.

42:45.471 --> 42:47.564
Cut corners to keep
costs down and profits up.

42:47.715 --> 42:51.234
Well, that's what should be
on your business cards.

42:51.311 --> 42:54.237
PEARCE: Oh, no, no, no.
When I'm done with Paragon,

42:54.314 --> 42:56.221
they won't have a card left
to print it on.

42:56.299 --> 42:57.907
Oh.

42:58.059 --> 43:01.327
I... need to make some calls.

43:04.641 --> 43:06.307
(Tommy chuckles)

43:06.326 --> 43:09.568
Ooh, karma is a beautiful thing.
