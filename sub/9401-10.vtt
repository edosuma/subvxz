00:00.708 --> 00:02.175
Maybe we need a vacation.

00:02.379 --> 00:04.269
Tree Hill. I want to go home.

00:04.304 --> 00:05.345
Hello, Nathan.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.591
I think I'm pregnant. I don't
know how Julian's gonna take it.

00:08.626 --> 00:11.447
The test came back negative.
You're not pregnant.

00:11.482 --> 00:14.563
What do you mean you're on
your way to Alex's hotel room?

00:14.598 --> 00:17.813
She found some cocaine and
she thinks she may relapse.

00:17.848 --> 00:19.051
I don't understand.

00:21.092 --> 00:22.591
You've been lying all night.

00:22.626 --> 00:26.053
Blowing Brooke off, messing up at work,
partying all the time, and now these pills.

00:26.088 --> 00:27.355
It's a lot of pressure to fit in.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.378
And for once, I want to fit in.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.320
I'm gonna ask for four
years. We'll take three.

00:35.355 --> 00:37.930
- It's how the game's played, Nate.
- You're sure they won't stop playing?

00:37.965 --> 00:40.036
Buddy, trust me.

00:40.071 --> 00:41.164
All right.

00:41.199 --> 00:42.801
What are you afraid of?

00:43.078 --> 00:45.767
To move on. To feel
something for someone new.

00:45.802 --> 00:47.885
But I'm tired of being afraid. I...

00:49.506 --> 00:51.754
Big news in the NBA...
The Charlotte Bobcats

00:51.789 --> 00:54.052
have opened up their checkbook
and capped themselves out,

00:54.087 --> 00:57.119
acquiring Derek McDaniel in
a hush-hush deal late today.

00:57.154 --> 01:00.108
That's bad news for local star Nathan
Scott, who is going to have to find

01:00.143 --> 01:02.374
a spot elsewhere, if at all.

One Tree Hill - 07x10 - You Are

01:09.672 --> 01:12.100
In the national league, the
Dodgers beat the Cardinals...

01:12.135 --> 01:13.603
Nathan, what's happening?

01:13.638 --> 01:15.872
- They signed a point guard.
- Well, what does that mean?

01:15.907 --> 01:18.271
It means... it means I lost my job.

01:18.306 --> 01:20.279
- But...
- Look, they signed Derek McDaniel, okay?

01:20.314 --> 01:23.407
He's an All-Star, he plays my
position, and he costs a lot of money.

01:23.442 --> 01:25.598
- Okay.
- There's a salary cap, all right?

01:25.633 --> 01:27.451
Each team can only spend so much money.

01:27.475 --> 01:29.531
That report said the team's capped out.

01:29.777 --> 01:31.249
- So that means...
- They're done.

01:31.305 --> 01:34.504
The roster's locked. They signed
a point guard, and it's not me.

01:35.422 --> 01:38.160
- I have to go see Clay.
- Nathan, can Clay fix this?

01:38.195 --> 01:39.259
No.

01:39.455 --> 01:41.361
As of five minutes ago,

01:41.654 --> 01:43.365
I'm not gonna be a Bobcat.

01:45.817 --> 01:48.832
You know, I told Clay to make sure
that he closed this deal for me,

01:48.867 --> 01:50.725
and he said he would.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.402
Now I want him to look me in the eye

01:53.437 --> 01:55.344
and tell me why he lied to me.

02:01.417 --> 02:02.802
You lied to me.

02:02.837 --> 02:05.592
Julian, wait! It was
full of cocaine! I swear!

02:05.627 --> 02:07.718
Come on, Alex. You were
lonely and you wanted me here,

02:07.753 --> 02:10.570
so you made up some story about a
cocaine vial that you knew was empty.

02:10.604 --> 02:13.555
That's not true. I wouldn't lie to you.

02:13.722 --> 02:17.323
Oh, right, because your track
record of not lying is so impeccable.

02:17.982 --> 02:19.530
I don't deserve that.

02:19.565 --> 02:20.818
Then where is it?

02:20.853 --> 02:24.356
You tell me what... what the cocaine
fairy did with your supposed vial of blow,

02:24.359 --> 02:26.270
and I'll take it all back.

02:26.516 --> 02:28.585
Until then, don't call me ever.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.835
Who you are is who you are.

02:33.338 --> 02:34.870
We're liars.

02:35.362 --> 02:36.764
We're thieves.

02:37.847 --> 02:39.239
We're addicts.

02:46.890 --> 02:49.904
We take our happiness for
granted until we hurt ourselves

02:49.939 --> 02:51.999
or someone else.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.797

03:06.206 --> 03:08.247
Could you open the door, please?

03:11.343 --> 03:12.716
I'm sorry.

03:23.963 --> 03:25.546
We hold grudges.

03:30.554 --> 03:34.007
And when faced with our
mistakes, we reinvent the past.

03:34.332 --> 03:36.220
We reinvent ourselves.

03:36.255 --> 03:38.133
At least, we try.

03:41.748 --> 03:45.049
We're prideful and we're lustful

03:45.084 --> 03:47.404
and we are incredibly flawed.

03:49.236 --> 03:50.686
And eventually...

03:51.111 --> 03:53.286
our flaws catch up to us.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.767
- Nate. What's up?
- We need to talk.

04:00.554 --> 04:02.882
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

04:03.454 --> 04:05.305
What's wrong is I don't have a job.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.217
It's gonna be okay. We countered.

04:07.252 --> 04:09.325
- And?
- And I'm waiting to hear back.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.249
Well, you can stop waiting. The
Bobcats just signed Derek McDaniel.

04:12.284 --> 04:13.952
No, they wouldn't do that.
That would cap 'em out.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.821
It did cap them out!

04:15.856 --> 04:18.325
That was my team, Clay!
We were building something!

04:18.360 --> 04:20.589
Hold on. Wait. Where did you hear this?

04:20.624 --> 04:23.410
It's on "Sportscenter,"
for God's sake, Clay!

04:23.624 --> 04:25.818
You're my agent! What the
hell have you been doing?!

04:25.853 --> 04:28.146
Baby, where's that beer you promised?

04:30.712 --> 04:32.543
No, I...I take it back.

04:32.578 --> 04:35.543
- You were my agent.
- No. Nate, would you just wait?

04:35.578 --> 04:38.791
You knew how important it was for
my family that I play close to home.

04:38.826 --> 04:40.570
- I know that.
- So why didn't you close the deal?!

04:40.605 --> 04:42.960
- Because I thought we could do better.
- Oh, that's great.

04:43.804 --> 04:46.971
I asked you to do two things for
me... make sure I play for the Bobcats

04:47.006 --> 04:48.859
and stay away from Quinn.

04:53.204 --> 04:55.646
You're fired. Enjoy your date.

04:56.128 --> 04:57.731
What? Nate!

04:58.136 --> 04:59.281
Nate!

05:11.200 --> 05:14.638
Gene, you told me you weren't
pursuing any other point guards.

05:14.673 --> 05:16.685
You said you were
negotiating with Nathan,

05:16.720 --> 05:19.222
and that you were spending the
rest of your money on a center.

05:20.838 --> 05:25.035
Absolutely Derek McDaniel's a fantastic player,
But we were in the middle of a negotiation.

05:25.976 --> 05:28.418
So I assume that the 2-year offer is...

05:28.856 --> 05:30.993
You're capped out. Right.

05:32.281 --> 05:34.131
Yeah. I'm...I'm sorry, too.

05:35.262 --> 05:38.143
I appreciate you taking
the call so late at night.

05:47.701 --> 05:49.799
Negotiations are about risks.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.189
You take calculated risks.

05:52.224 --> 05:54.902
- I was doing what I thought was right.
- Of course you were.

05:55.818 --> 05:57.344
I made a mistake.

06:00.597 --> 06:02.066
Can I help you?

06:02.910 --> 06:04.074
No.

06:05.128 --> 06:06.425
But thank you.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.115
I, uh, I actually should... I
should probably just call my bosses

06:12.150 --> 06:15.896
and just see what I could do for
Nathan somewhere else in the league.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.742
So, you know, you... you
probably should get going.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.306
Yeah.

06:24.445 --> 06:25.799
You know, just...

06:26.090 --> 06:29.085
I dragged you along to the volunteer
thing, and I was here tonight, and...

06:29.120 --> 06:30.769
It's not your fault.

06:31.227 --> 06:32.390
I'm so sorry.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.184
Hey, it's not your fault. Come here.

06:35.510 --> 06:37.990
- If there's anything that I can do...
- There's not...

06:39.254 --> 06:40.532
But thank you.

06:40.837 --> 06:42.096
I'll call you.

06:42.131 --> 06:45.287
Look, you should call
Nathan and talk to him.

06:45.926 --> 06:47.452
You know that he loves you.

06:47.815 --> 06:48.998
Yeah.

07:11.686 --> 07:14.089
Antwon, it's 3:00 a.m.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.880
I know, baby. I was checking
to see if Julian called.

07:16.997 --> 07:19.462
He said he was gonna hook me up with
his sports-coordinating contacts.

07:19.472 --> 07:24.129
I know that's what he said, and I'm sure he will,
but nobody's gonna call at 3:00 in the morning.

07:24.435 --> 07:27.985
- He could.
- He won't. Nobody's up 3:00 a.m.

07:30.671 --> 07:32.245
Somebody's up.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.938
- Millie?
- Oh, hey.

07:40.006 --> 07:42.626
- What's going on?
- I'm getting rid of my fat clothes.

07:42.732 --> 07:44.158
At 3:00 in the morning?

07:44.257 --> 07:45.695
I couldn't sleep.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.345
Okay. Uh, do you want some company?

07:48.451 --> 07:51.299
No. It's okay. You can sleep.
I'll come to bed when I'm done.

07:51.693 --> 07:52.928
Millie, are you okay?

07:54.023 --> 07:55.442
Never been better.

08:03.162 --> 08:04.791
Hey. What are you doing up?

08:06.021 --> 08:09.082
- Worrying. What are you doing out?
- I was at Clay's.

08:09.433 --> 08:10.734
Yeah, I know.

08:11.025 --> 08:13.272
- Do you know Nathan fired him?
- Yep.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.809
- Yeah. It's not right, Haley.
- Don't talk to me about what's right.

08:15.819 --> 08:18.450
- In fact, don't even talk to me at all.
- Oh, are you gonna fire me, too,

08:18.460 --> 08:20.652
- because I was with Clay?
- You feel bad for Clay?

08:20.712 --> 08:22.554
- Of course I do.
- You should.

08:22.643 --> 08:26.008
You were a huge part of him getting
fired tonight. And you know it.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.386
Why don't you sleep on that?

08:39.203 --> 08:40.760
How'd you sleep?

08:40.970 --> 08:41.988
Not good.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.018
Good.

08:44.897 --> 08:48.107
I'm sorry. I thought Alex
was in trouble, and I reacted.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.309
She okay?

08:52.274 --> 08:54.773
- She's fine.
- Imagine that.

08:55.289 --> 08:57.754
Brooke, you would have done the same
thing if she would have called you.

08:57.821 --> 09:00.235
Yeah, but she didn't call
me. She called her boyfriend.

09:00.719 --> 09:02.211
I mean, my boyfriend.

09:02.284 --> 09:05.549
Look, I know we were supposed to have a
night together, but we can do that tonight.

09:06.253 --> 09:08.734
Or any night, okay? Don't get upset.

09:09.012 --> 09:10.686
I'm not upset about that.

09:10.986 --> 09:13.216
- Yes, you are.
- Not about that

09:13.299 --> 09:15.914
- Well, what else is there?
- I thought I was pregnant.

09:16.217 --> 09:17.307
What?

09:18.430 --> 09:20.589
I'm not. So you're good.

09:23.699 --> 09:25.711
I would have been good if you were.

09:27.465 --> 09:28.984
If we were.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.020
Don't say that to me.

09:38.876 --> 09:40.512
You knew last night.

09:40.729 --> 09:42.592
I'm such an idiot. Come here.

09:44.387 --> 09:46.501
I'm sorry. I messed up.

09:48.392 --> 09:49.481
Are you sad?

09:51.494 --> 09:52.557
A little.

09:57.499 --> 09:58.923
It's gonna be okay.

10:07.621 --> 10:09.572
I need more clothes. Mine are way too big.

10:09.756 --> 10:12.805
Did you ever hear of this place called
a store? They actually sell clothes.

10:12.866 --> 10:15.403
The "sell" part's the problem.
I'm so broke right now.

10:15.413 --> 10:17.827
Well, then you need to call
my agent, like I told you.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.218
How'd you get in, anyway?

10:19.273 --> 10:21.941
I've had a key to your place
since, like, forever, remember?

10:22.492 --> 10:25.981
Which explains why you've pretty
much taken everything in there.

10:31.081 --> 10:33.136
- You're up early.
- I didn't sleep.

10:33.208 --> 10:36.715
I mean, I couldn't sleep. I just totally sorted
through my clothes and threw out, like, 90% of it.

10:36.725 --> 10:38.482
Most of it was ass-ugly anyway.

10:40.214 --> 10:41.460
Yeah.

10:44.588 --> 10:46.446
Nate, it's Clay. Look,

10:46.517 --> 10:49.026
I know you're upset, man, and
you have every right to be,

10:49.115 --> 10:51.112
but will you at least
please call me back?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.387
We've been friends
for a long time, and...

10:55.414 --> 10:57.456
I'm sorry. Just call me back.

11:18.150 --> 11:19.302
Rachel?

11:20.381 --> 11:22.313
- Oh. Hi, baby.
- Hi.

11:22.825 --> 11:24.221
What's going on?

11:24.707 --> 11:28.812
Well, I came here last night just
to take a walk down bad memory lane,

11:29.100 --> 11:30.724
and I had an idea.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.547
For sweeps.

11:33.895 --> 11:36.295
We do a live broadcast...

11:37.463 --> 11:38.781
right from here.

11:40.596 --> 11:42.319
From the hallway where
I murdered my brother?

11:42.491 --> 11:43.509
Exactly.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.051
Where one of your
classmates committed suicide?

11:46.277 --> 11:48.302
I was in the classroom that day.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.516
I can lend an authenticity to it.

11:51.327 --> 11:54.515
We can reach out to the
disenfranchised or whatever.

11:55.328 --> 11:59.689
And you can finally come to term
with the choices you made that day.

11:59.775 --> 12:01.799
Oh. It'll be riveting television.

12:02.332 --> 12:03.784
Little insensitive, isn'it?

12:03.851 --> 12:06.015
Not as insensitive as
murdering your brother.

12:11.974 --> 12:13.415
Think about it.

12:22.071 --> 12:24.074
- What?
- I know who took the coke.

12:24.185 --> 12:25.264
Alex, you...

12:26.149 --> 12:27.261
Okay.

12:28.091 --> 12:30.405
- Why not? Who?
- I can't tell you.

12:31.954 --> 12:33.089
It's perfect.

12:33.428 --> 12:35.513
- Y-You know what? It doesn't
matter.
- It does matter.

12:35.523 --> 12:38.317
- You said you didn't want to speak to me.
- No, Alex, it doesn't matter.

12:38.327 --> 12:40.947
I just got off the phone with
my dad. I was about to call you.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.808
It's not happening for the script.

12:44.053 --> 12:47.583
- What do you mean? A... already?
- It's good script, Alex. It's just...

12:48.656 --> 12:52.030
there are a few other scripts with
similar story lines already in production.

12:52.114 --> 12:55.249
But our... our script is
good. I mean, it... it's great.

12:56.050 --> 12:57.800
It's just bad timing.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.025
So it's really over?

13:00.805 --> 13:02.313
Just like that?

13:02.936 --> 13:04.026
Yeah.

13:04.163 --> 13:05.398
I'm sorry.

13:09.113 --> 13:10.659
Ken, I'm sorry.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.623
Yeah.

13:16.758 --> 13:18.873
I heard that Sacramento
was gonna sign McDaniel.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.871
I had been told it was a done deal.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.380
No, I...I wasn't being overly
aggressive. They offered Nathan two years.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.370
I countered at four, but...

13:28.063 --> 13:30.533
Yeah, there was a 2-year
offer on the table, but...

13:34.537 --> 13:36.577
I said I'm sorry, sir.

13:40.289 --> 13:42.742
- Don't expect me to say I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have fired him.

13:42.752 --> 13:45.912
- It's business, Quinn.
- No, it's personal, and you know that it is.

13:45.979 --> 13:48.785
Do you like staying here?
In your big guestroom?

13:49.313 --> 13:51.610
'Cause I just lost my job, Quinn.

13:52.038 --> 13:53.763
It is business.

13:56.695 --> 13:58.130
Talk to him.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.771
It's not him. It's his agency.

14:01.036 --> 14:04.297
Nathan, do what you have to do, but
please don't tell them that you fired him.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.817
He's going through some stuff, and
he has always been there for you.

14:10.095 --> 14:11.559
Just think about it, please?

14:14.224 --> 14:15.934
This is Nathan.

14:16.285 --> 14:17.285
Yes.

14:26.234 --> 14:27.281
Brooke?!

14:31.724 --> 14:32.998
What are you doing here?

14:33.204 --> 14:34.975
You asked me to come.

14:35.196 --> 14:36.198
I did not.

14:36.694 --> 14:40.069
Well, not in so many words,
but a call after midnight

14:40.104 --> 14:42.510
with no message is a call for help.

14:42.545 --> 14:43.882
So, what's wrong?

14:44.125 --> 14:46.169
It's Julian and Alex, isn't it?

14:46.204 --> 14:47.807
Kind of. It's...

14:48.293 --> 14:50.428
Julian and Alex and me.

14:51.244 --> 14:54.816
It's the new line and my idea
for the men's line. It's...

14:55.334 --> 14:57.151
- all of it.
- And where's Millicent?

14:57.186 --> 14:59.956
Or does my boss no longer help
you now that she's one of them?

14:59.991 --> 15:03.235
Millicent is the least
of my worries right now.

15:05.546 --> 15:07.067
Clothes over Bros.

15:10.314 --> 15:12.927
It's for you. It's Millicent's agent.

15:14.094 --> 15:15.748
Millicent has an agent?

15:15.960 --> 15:19.335
They say they're Spencer
and Heidi people. Go figure.

15:21.374 --> 15:22.880
I wonder what she wants.

15:23.294 --> 15:25.830
$500,000?!

15:26.315 --> 15:30.199
- That's what you paid Alex. 
- She's an award-winning actress.

15:30.234 --> 15:33.868
Not anymore. Now she's one of
two faces of Clothes over Bros.

15:34.285 --> 15:38.103
Oh, wait. You fired her. That leaves me.

15:39.635 --> 15:40.649
Millie...

15:41.224 --> 15:43.400
you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

15:43.945 --> 15:46.722
The campaign's a hit for us,
Brooke. The press loves it.

15:46.757 --> 15:48.590
I just want what's fair.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.373
What's fair?

15:50.486 --> 15:51.774
What's fair?!

15:51.853 --> 15:54.503
What's fair is that we're friends!

15:54.764 --> 15:58.024
What's fair is that you
started out as my assistant,

15:58.059 --> 16:00.190
and I trained you to
run the entire company!

16:00.225 --> 16:02.760
What's fair is that when you
were miserable in New York,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.506
I moved you home so
you could be with Mouth!

16:06.674 --> 16:09.256
And I appreciate all of that.

16:10.015 --> 16:12.179
But I don't see how it has
anything to do with this.

16:13.173 --> 16:17.041
Well, it does. Because
you're being ungrateful.

16:17.675 --> 16:19.962
You are an ungrateful employee.

16:21.955 --> 16:22.955
No.

16:23.124 --> 16:26.786
I'm an ungrateful model.
And that costs more.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.717
Bad time?

16:40.174 --> 16:41.828
Hey. No. Come on in.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.740
You sure? 'Cause if you're writing
the next "wanted dead or alive,"

16:48.775 --> 16:51.237
- I don't want to interrupt.
- Bon Jovi? Really?

16:51.272 --> 16:52.706
I love that song.

16:54.654 --> 16:55.683
So...

16:57.124 --> 17:00.025
How you doing? Do I need to go
platinum so we can keep the house?

17:00.060 --> 17:01.174
No, not yet.

17:01.874 --> 17:05.190
The agency called this morning. They're
saying all the right things but...

17:08.084 --> 17:10.319
You think I made the right
decision by firing Clay.

17:10.694 --> 17:13.989
I don't know. It's a tough
question. On one hand, he's Clay.

17:14.023 --> 17:17.476
You guys have been friends for
over a year. And he's a huge reason

17:17.511 --> 17:20.243
- why we are where we are today.
- I know.

17:21.695 --> 17:26.249
On the other hand you're unemployed
a bunch of million dollars poorer.

17:26.885 --> 17:28.655
He didn't do what you told him to,

17:28.690 --> 17:32.325
and you're not gonna be able to
play close to home next season.

17:32.474 --> 17:35.161
And he's sneaking around with Quinn.

17:35.754 --> 17:36.597
I know. That's a lot.

17:37.594 --> 17:38.803
Yeah, it is.

17:39.944 --> 17:42.649
You said the agency called,
did you them that you fired him?

17:42.684 --> 17:43.684
No.

17:44.224 --> 17:46.398
Quinn said he's going
through some stuff, so..

17:46.834 --> 17:49.050
Yeah. Quinn's going through
some stuff. You know, we're,

17:49.085 --> 17:51.488
we're all going through some stuff.

17:52.034 --> 17:55.922
This is your career, and
we've sacrificed a lot for it.

17:57.174 --> 17:59.251
I think you should put yourself first.

18:03.144 --> 18:04.787
I need to make a call.

18:08.184 --> 18:10.899
- Man, I thought you was never gonna call.
- I said I would.

18:10.934 --> 18:13.591
- Why, you waiting by the phone?
- No.

18:16.124 --> 18:18.950
All right, so there's this sport-
coordination company called Sports-Arc.

18:18.985 --> 18:21.427
They do a bunch of TV show and movies.

18:21.584 --> 18:23.091
They want to talk to you.

18:23.234 --> 18:25.778
That's what I'm talking about.
Baby, that's good looking out.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.566
So they're out in LA. They're a great bunch of guys,
you just got to call them and introduce yourself.

18:30.445 --> 18:31.283
I'll huh...

18:32.771 --> 18:35.995
- I'll text you the number.
- Wait, so if... if they're in LA,

18:36.030 --> 18:37.959
would I still be able to
work from here like you do?

18:38.453 --> 18:42.802
Uh, eventually, but I think you'd have to move
out there for a little while, at least at first.

18:43.815 --> 18:46.631
Okay, so... Los Angeles.

18:49.704 --> 18:53.173
Look, I got to take off. I'll text you their
number. I hope it all works out, all right?

18:53.375 --> 18:56.381
- All right thanks again man. I owe you one.
- Don't worry about it.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.056
Alex?

19:02.644 --> 19:05.928
- What's up?
- Just waiting for a text.

19:06.454 --> 19:09.193
Okay. You sounded weird on the phone.

19:10.663 --> 19:13.694
- You need to stop doing cocaine.
- What?

19:16.824 --> 19:18.620
You're a funny bitch.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.609
Don't call me a bitch.

19:21.063 --> 19:23.118
You need to stop doing cocaine.

19:23.887 --> 19:27.662
And you know I say that with no
judgment and a lot of experience

19:28.004 --> 19:29.775
because it's my cocaine
you've been doing.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.078
- Alex...
- That you took out of my closet

19:32.113 --> 19:35.281
with all of my clothes  Miss "I've
been up all night and I have my own key

19:35.316 --> 19:36.463
to your room."

19:36.664 --> 19:38.135
So don't lie to me.

19:40.134 --> 19:41.186
I'm sorry.

19:43.386 --> 19:45.331
Have you ever done coke before this?

19:48.263 --> 19:50.647
Then trust me... it's time to stop.

19:52.034 --> 19:53.082
I will.

19:53.545 --> 19:54.593
And you can?

19:55.045 --> 19:58.002
Of course I can. I just wanted to
try it, but I don't need to do it.

19:58.383 --> 19:59.736
That's right. You don't.

20:00.163 --> 20:02.473
You can roll with me,
and we'll have a blast.

20:02.846 --> 20:04.783
But I can't be around cocaine,

20:05.124 --> 20:07.051
and I can't have friends
that are doing it.

20:07.525 --> 20:08.672
I won't.

20:10.614 --> 20:12.504
Okay. I promise. I'm done.

20:13.195 --> 20:13.910
Okay.

20:15.145 --> 20:17.674
Now come here. I need a hug.

20:18.025 --> 20:19.069
Why?

20:22.425 --> 20:24.779
Because I have to stop my drug, too.

20:32.475 --> 20:36.207
- She must be high.
- No I'm not high. I just had

20:36.296 --> 20:39.482
three martinis at lunch.
Okay, I'm a little buzzed.

20:39.664 --> 20:42.465
Not you drinky. Millicent.

20:42.614 --> 20:44.484
She expects me to pay her

20:44.686 --> 20:48.580
$500,000 to model for this company.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.388
That's not high. That's smoking crack.

20:51.423 --> 20:54.713
That's what I said! You know, this is
all Alex's influence. That little bitch

20:54.738 --> 20:57.148
has been a pain in my
perfect Pilates ass since

20:57.155 --> 20:58.966
she rolled out of rehab and landed here.

20:59.001 --> 21:00.425
You leave Alex to me.

21:01.091 --> 21:03.837
But, you know, as far as Millicent...

21:03.872 --> 21:05.649
the campaign is working.

21:05.684 --> 21:08.470
That is not the point, mother.

21:09.195 --> 21:10.602
Actually, it is.

21:11.863 --> 21:13.694
I'm just saying that, you know,

21:13.729 --> 21:15.974
we can negotiate, find a happy meeting.

21:16.009 --> 21:16.913
Forget it.

21:16.948 --> 21:20.061
I'm closer to firing her
than to negotiating with her.

21:20.096 --> 21:21.200
I understand.

21:21.753 --> 21:22.753
I do.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.481
But you can't fire everyone.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.753
- Hey.
- Hey. They're in the living room.

21:31.788 --> 21:33.471
- How long have they been here?
- About 20 minutes.

21:33.506 --> 21:35.412
- I called you as soon as I found out.
- Thanks.

21:35.447 --> 21:36.440
Yeah.

21:37.514 --> 21:40.674
I can't reiterate enough
that while this is a setback,

21:40.709 --> 21:44.112
we feel like there's still a great
deal to make for you with another team.

21:44.147 --> 21:47.242
- And what deal is that, Ken?
- I don't think this is the time

21:47.277 --> 21:48.649
or place, Clay.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.553
I'll be upstairs with Jamie.

21:50.588 --> 21:52.896
With all due respect, I think it is.

21:53.015 --> 21:54.787
What deal were you
gonna get Nathan, Ken?

21:54.822 --> 21:56.720
- Actually, we've o...
- Shut up, Jay.

21:56.755 --> 21:58.591
What teams have you spoken with?

21:58.626 --> 22:02.132
'Cause since last night, I talked to
every GM or assistant GM in the league.

22:02.663 --> 22:04.398
Nate, this is what they do, all right?

22:04.417 --> 22:06.550
At the first sign of blood,
they insist upon seeing you,

22:06.585 --> 22:09.496
and they promise you a ton
of things they can't deliver.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.624
Actually, I called them.

22:13.509 --> 22:14.519
Clay,

22:14.554 --> 22:17.521
Nathan tells us you're not
representing him anymore.

22:17.556 --> 22:21.174
And we respect that, considering
what happened with the Bobcats.

22:21.364 --> 22:22.364
And?

22:22.791 --> 22:26.204
And I think it's best if you resign

22:26.373 --> 22:27.831
and leave the agency.

22:32.534 --> 22:33.933
No, I can't do that.

22:34.904 --> 22:37.387
I made a vow to someone
that I would never quit

22:37.422 --> 22:39.074
and I'm not about to betray that now.

22:39.111 --> 22:42.709
Then, unfortunately, as of today,
you're no longer employed by ISC.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.954
You're not to enter your
office here or Los Angeles.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.431
Kelly will send you
your personal belongings.

22:48.531 --> 22:50.008
I'm sorry, Clay.

22:50.029 --> 22:51.556
It's okay, Kelly.

22:59.476 --> 23:00.917
I'm sorry, too.

23:15.848 --> 23:17.491
This seat taken?

23:19.067 --> 23:20.205
No, but yes.

23:21.064 --> 23:23.272
I appreciate what you did for Nathan.

23:24.393 --> 23:27.411
I assume since you're here,
your station manager didn't.

23:29.807 --> 23:31.656
Good luck with the job hunt.

23:34.683 --> 23:36.402
It doesn't matter...

23:38.143 --> 23:40.430
what you did and what I did.

23:40.932 --> 23:43.095
Nathan still lost his job.

23:43.953 --> 23:45.077
Since when?

23:45.836 --> 23:48.206
Since they signed Derek McDaniel.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.035
Television's funny, isn't it?

23:53.557 --> 23:56.068
It can erase all your mistakes

23:56.329 --> 23:57.931
or hold them against you.

23:59.258 --> 24:01.091
Doesn't erase anything.

24:02.323 --> 24:04.371
And you didn't make a mistake.

24:04.604 --> 24:05.759
Remember that.

24:14.927 --> 24:16.924
0 is so a size.

24:24.594 --> 24:26.194
Hey. It's Millie.

24:27.253 --> 24:28.871
I need a favor.

24:34.238 --> 24:36.909
Wow, look at that. My sister,
Quinn, running away again.

24:37.064 --> 24:40.832
You know, before you say anything else like that,
you might want to remember that I can kick your ass.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.016
Going home?

24:42.202 --> 24:43.436
I'm going to Clay's.

24:43.471 --> 24:45.791
- That is such a bad idea.
- Yeah?

24:45.826 --> 24:49.118
So was firing him. I saw the look on
Nathan's face when he saw me there.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.020
Really? You're gonna
make this about you?

24:51.055 --> 24:53.372
This is about Nathan's
career and business.

24:53.490 --> 24:55.555
It's business, but
it's not just business,

24:55.590 --> 24:57.027
and you know that, Haley.

24:57.305 --> 25:00.522
He was hurting, Haley. And
he protected Nathan from it.

25:00.557 --> 25:02.929
He swallowed his pain,
and he put Nathan first.

25:02.964 --> 25:05.709
And in trying to get you more and
him more, something went wrong.

25:05.744 --> 25:07.870
And those things happen in business.

25:07.905 --> 25:12.176
"Something went wrong"? Maybe something
went wrong because Clay got careless.

25:13.039 --> 25:14.483
You mean with me.

25:15.438 --> 25:19.215
Because Clay was being careless
and spending time with me.

25:20.461 --> 25:21.607
You know what? Fine.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.688
You can tell yourself that.

25:24.304 --> 25:26.280
But the truth is, Nathan
doesn't have a deal

25:26.315 --> 25:28.532
because Clay didn't
think it was good enough.

25:28.553 --> 25:31.707
He thought that Nathan was worth
more than what they were offering him.

25:32.478 --> 25:34.580
How dare he, right?

25:34.825 --> 25:37.217
I mean, where does he get off
holding Nathan in such high esteem

25:37.240 --> 25:39.425
that he thought that he deserved better?

25:40.126 --> 25:43.546
If that's the worst thing he ever
does, if that's what he got fired for,

25:43.581 --> 25:45.927
then I'm happy he's not
in Nathan's life anymore

25:45.962 --> 25:49.186
Because Clay deserves better than
that. He killed himself for Nathan.

25:49.371 --> 25:52.202
He believed in him, and
he loved him. For what?

25:54.494 --> 25:56.596
Look, I love you,
Hales, but this is wrong.

25:56.631 --> 25:58.929
So now you can sleep on that.

26:18.664 --> 26:19.664
Hi.

26:23.214 --> 26:24.580
They're beautiful.

26:24.969 --> 26:26.039
So are you.

26:28.854 --> 26:29.854
How you doing?

26:32.073 --> 26:33.076
Not so good.

26:34.079 --> 26:35.267
Yeah, I know.

26:36.893 --> 26:38.090
I don't think you do.

26:38.983 --> 26:40.728
No, I suppose I don't.

26:41.814 --> 26:43.925
But I want you to know something...

26:44.194 --> 26:47.961
I know that I've talked about
slowing down and taking our time...

26:49.067 --> 26:52.076
but I want you to know that
whenever we do get pregnant,

26:53.896 --> 26:56.020
That's gonna be a great day.

26:57.911 --> 27:00.237
And I'll be more than okay with it.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.903
We're not gonna have that day.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.820
Baby, we will.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.782
No, we won't.

27:14.879 --> 27:17.011
They didn't just tell me that...

27:18.359 --> 27:19.792
that I wasn't pregnant.

27:20.314 --> 27:22.750
They said I'm never gonna be.

27:24.445 --> 27:25.524
I can't.

27:27.774 --> 27:30.167
You can't have children?
They told you that?

27:31.005 --> 27:32.136
I'm sorry.

27:32.572 --> 27:33.664
Brooke...

27:46.642 --> 27:49.230
- Hey, shh. Baby, it's okay.
- It's not.

27:50.352 --> 27:51.430
It is. It's going to be.

27:51.898 --> 27:53.240
I love you so much.

27:53.275 --> 27:56.821
But I want to have babies with
you. I want to have a family.

27:56.856 --> 28:00.060
Then we'll get a second
opinion. And a third, okay?

28:00.076 --> 28:02.426
We'll find the best doctors out there.

28:02.496 --> 28:04.430
- What if ...
- Hey, shh, shh.

28:04.664 --> 28:05.684
I love you.

28:07.517 --> 28:09.844
That's all that matters. I love you.

28:11.842 --> 28:13.207
I love you, too.

28:30.526 --> 28:31.615
Millicent?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.362
Just a minute.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.174
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

28:36.209 --> 28:39.420
Makenna's over. It's
just... model stuff.

28:40.017 --> 28:42.994
Okay. Um... I kind of
have to use the bathroom.

28:43.075 --> 28:44.103
Hold on.

28:52.652 --> 28:54.785
- You must be Makenna.
- Yep.

28:55.816 --> 28:57.082
Bye.

29:41.806 --> 29:43.857
- What's going on, Millie?
- What?

29:44.138 --> 29:47.923
You're up all night. You're
in the bathroom with strangers.

29:48.028 --> 29:50.225
- She's a friend.
- Not to me.

29:51.807 --> 29:53.342
What's happening to you?

29:53.389 --> 29:54.994
I don't... I'm sorry.

29:55.041 --> 29:58.656
I just... those diet pills. I'll cut
back or I'll just stop taking them.

30:00.115 --> 30:02.799
- What's this all about?
- I don't know. What is that?

30:04.012 --> 30:06.637
- Are you doing drugs?
- Why are you saying that to me?

30:06.707 --> 30:08.875
Because you're in the
bathroom with some stranger,

30:08.910 --> 30:12.741
you're pacing around like a lunatic, and
there's cocaine on your makeup mirror.

30:12.788 --> 30:15.765
It was Makenna. She does
it. I swear it was just her.

30:15.812 --> 30:17.511
I wanted to tell her no,

30:17.552 --> 30:21.126
But I work with her, and I just...
wanted to be part of the group.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.179
Are you doing cocaine, Millie?

30:26.885 --> 30:27.975
No.

30:28.432 --> 30:30.084
I told you no.

30:30.324 --> 30:33.722
And I am so sick and tired of you
being so threatened by all of this.

30:33.781 --> 30:36.593
It's like I can't do anything right
anymore, and I'm really sick of it!

30:36.652 --> 30:39.652
And you need to stop!
Stop accusing me of things,

30:39.710 --> 30:42.165
stop judging me...

30:52.664 --> 30:54.691
I think this is yours.

31:13.648 --> 31:14.972
Sorry.

31:19.659 --> 31:23.163
A lifetime spent chasing a
dream and you piss it all away?

31:23.425 --> 31:25.979
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yeah?

31:26.155 --> 31:28.593
- Why don't you enlighten me?
- Why?

31:28.827 --> 31:30.479
What are you gonna do?

31:30.755 --> 31:32.114
Shoot me?

31:37.128 --> 31:41.240
Ever since Nathan was born, I
had a vision for him, a dream!

31:41.317 --> 31:42.798
Let go!

31:45.652 --> 31:47.972
- What did you do?
- Stop!

31:55.003 --> 31:57.446
He fired me! I'm not his agent!

31:57.528 --> 32:01.003
Yeah? Well, this is your lucky
day, 'cause this is your baptism.

32:06.904 --> 32:08.943
You got any fight left in you, kid?

32:08.990 --> 32:12.405
Come on! That's it. Fight back.

32:12.945 --> 32:14.140
Fight back! There you go!

32:17.586 --> 32:20.562
You think getting fired is
hard? Try going to prison!

32:20.691 --> 32:23.972
Try being given just days to live!

32:27.757 --> 32:29.292
You're out of your mind!

32:35.831 --> 32:38.667
Your new life starts today, kid.

32:40.318 --> 32:43.072
If you're worth anything at all,
you'll find a way to make it right.

32:43.131 --> 32:45.152
I already told you! I'm
not his agent anymore!

32:45.223 --> 32:46.957
And who's to blame for that?

32:47.051 --> 32:50.690
Your life is still your own. You
want to be an agent? Go be an agent.

32:52.242 --> 32:54.592
Just put on a suit, for God's sakes.

33:06.354 --> 33:10.450
So wait... he just attacked you
and then dragged you into the ocean?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.735
He said he was baptizing me.

33:13.373 --> 33:16.812
That if I wanted to be an
agent, I need to wear a suit.

33:16.925 --> 33:17.939
What?

33:17.978 --> 33:20.374
- It isn't funny.
- It's a little funny.

33:20.503 --> 33:22.425
That a murderer tried to drown me

33:22.507 --> 33:24.874
and then give me fashion
advice... that's funny to you?

33:24.956 --> 33:27.920
- The girl who's afraid of the ocean?
- A little.

33:29.812 --> 33:32.531
It's a lit... it's a
little funny, actually.

33:34.957 --> 33:36.562
I had all this coming.

33:37.910 --> 33:40.406
I was arrogant with Nathan's deal.

33:40.628 --> 33:42.374
I was arrogant in general.

33:42.503 --> 33:44.589
You didn't deserve to be fired.

33:45.474 --> 33:49.552
Or to have a killer dunk your
head and criticize your wardrobe.

33:50.689 --> 33:51.972
Thank you.

33:52.675 --> 33:54.773
- I mean it.
- You're welcome.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.791
I just... I feel terrible.

34:00.096 --> 34:04.209
- You know, I know Nathan didn't want me here and...
- I want you here.

34:06.717 --> 34:09.178
I left the house. I moved out.

34:10.103 --> 34:11.449
Stay here.

34:11.779 --> 34:14.427
Yeah, I... I can't. I'm sorry.

34:15.329 --> 34:16.677
It's okay.

34:16.998 --> 34:20.215
You know, I do think he
was right about the suit.

34:31.364 --> 34:34.494
So, I've been watching this
little psychic bartender act

34:34.552 --> 34:37.992
you have going... the way you predict what
people like to drink. What's the trick?

34:38.050 --> 34:41.302
It's no trick. I just
pay attention to people.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.850
Okay. What's my... drink?

34:43.897 --> 34:45.174
That's easy.

34:45.268 --> 34:46.739
You're a martini woman.

34:46.935 --> 34:49.000
Uh, you detest cheap vodka.

34:49.081 --> 34:51.789
And you like your martinis dirty,

34:51.888 --> 34:53.658
the dirtier the better.

34:54.056 --> 34:55.925
And you like your martinis shaken,

34:56.873 --> 34:59.722
a bit roughly, at that.

35:08.187 --> 35:11.652
I'm looking for a lover.
You just made the list.

35:16.451 --> 35:18.112
Hi, Mrs. Davis.

35:18.226 --> 35:19.743
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

35:20.096 --> 35:21.769
Really? Come on.

35:22.279 --> 35:24.633
Oh, I remember. You know my daughter.

35:25.078 --> 35:27.728
Your name is Fetch or Dash or something.

35:28.103 --> 35:30.477
- Chase.
- Right.

35:30.530 --> 35:33.956
But I didn't just date
your daughter. We were, uh,

35:33.996 --> 35:35.120
lovers.

35:36.637 --> 35:40.412
Yes. For about 30 seconds,
from what I've heard.

35:46.201 --> 35:49.362
We should shave that woman's head
and check for the mark of the beast.

35:49.388 --> 35:51.389
I thought she was kind of hot.

35:52.903 --> 35:56.080
Hi, grungy, kind of hot bartender guy.

35:56.198 --> 35:58.225
Four shots of tequila,

35:58.382 --> 36:00.082
no salt, extra limes.

36:01.669 --> 36:05.724
- And can you tell how I like to...
- Mostly on top.

36:05.776 --> 36:08.562
Huh. Nice. You just made the list.

36:09.869 --> 36:12.184
- Hey. You okay?
- No, I'm not.

36:12.563 --> 36:14.420
- Me neither.
- Let's drink.

36:14.511 --> 36:17.088
But you're sober... why did you do that?

36:17.703 --> 36:20.183
You know that text
message I was waiting for?

36:20.205 --> 36:21.735
I never got it.

36:26.970 --> 36:29.337
- Stay with me tonight, okay?
- Sure.

36:43.429 --> 36:47.888
Not exactly what I meant when I
said, "take control of your life."

36:48.019 --> 36:50.053
At least the suit looks nice.

36:53.323 --> 36:56.893
Guess some people just
don't have the fortitude.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.456
My wife died.

37:01.346 --> 37:03.477
Suddenly and unfairly.

37:05.203 --> 37:08.702
But she believed in me, and she
believed in what I wanted to do.

37:09.696 --> 37:13.031
So, I buried her, and I
picked out her headstone,

37:13.254 --> 37:15.150
and then I went to work.

37:16.824 --> 37:21.551
So don't tell me about fortitude,
and don't lecture me about dark days

37:21.775 --> 37:25.763
because this  is far
from my darkest day.

37:27.084 --> 37:28.614
You want to get a drink?

37:36.180 --> 37:38.468
I might be in a dark place.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.209
At least there's hope
for me with Nathan.

37:42.503 --> 37:44.399
I wouldn't say the same for you.

37:59.649 --> 38:02.578
All right. Let's go
someplace fun. Come on.

38:02.826 --> 38:04.343
We should call a cab.

38:04.474 --> 38:07.332
Yeah, because that's how we roll.

38:08.313 --> 38:09.411
Come on.

38:17.785 --> 38:20.404
Yes, I'd like to report a drunk driver.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.817
Hey. Just wanted to
say goodbye to Jamie.

38:57.497 --> 39:00.086
- You staying with Clay?
- No. A hotel.

39:03.247 --> 39:04.541
Okay. I'll see ya.

39:05.522 --> 39:06.581
Quinn.

39:08.817 --> 39:13.293
All my life I've looked up to
you, my beautiful artist sister.

39:13.659 --> 39:16.823
But I don't anymore. You
seem lost to me. You seem...

39:17.455 --> 39:18.540
Selfish.

39:21.456 --> 39:23.836
I hope everything works out for Nathan.

39:42.424 --> 39:44.451
Step out of the car, please.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.228
You never called back.

40:00.621 --> 40:02.477
There wasn't anything else to say.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.906
Except for this...

40:04.468 --> 40:05.566
I'm sorry.

40:05.684 --> 40:08.294
Not for where I set the bar for you,

40:08.320 --> 40:11.301
But that I didn't get
you what you wanted.

40:12.134 --> 40:14.802
You're the best client I've ever had.

40:15.835 --> 40:17.835
I'm gonna miss representing you.

40:18.685 --> 40:20.417
Yeah, but more than that...

40:21.764 --> 40:24.766
you were also the best
friend I've ever had.

40:27.209 --> 40:29.550
I'm gonna miss that more.

40:34.663 --> 40:35.905
Good luck.

40:50.324 --> 40:51.605
Good luck.

40:51.788 --> 40:54.325
Brooke, it's Millicent.

40:55.008 --> 40:56.093
I'm sorry.

40:56.695 --> 40:59.559
I got arrested, and I need your help.

41:00.461 --> 41:01.978
I can't help you.

41:12.581 --> 41:13.718
Who was that?

41:14.594 --> 41:15.706
Nobody.
