01:27.754 --> 01:29.719
<i>Dr. Harrison, stop.</i>

01:29.721 --> 01:30.987
You can't run forever.

01:38.864 --> 01:40.863
<i>There's no escape, Doctor.</i>

01:40.865 --> 01:42.234
<i>You're coming with us.</i>

01:48.808 --> 01:52.412
Don't use your dart
gun. We got him cornered.

01:58.984 --> 02:01.087
Argh! We were so close...

02:26.012 --> 02:27.945
Daddy.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.481
- Hmm?
- Daddy.

02:54.473 --> 02:56.106
Adam Harrison!

02:56.108 --> 02:58.042
Huh? Oh, yes, sir?

02:58.044 --> 03:00.177
No sleeping in detention.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.748
Use this time for something productive.

03:07.819 --> 03:10.120
What?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.357
What's going on back there?

03:14.359 --> 03:15.858
That's disgusting!

03:15.860 --> 03:17.860
Adam, what's the problem?

03:17.862 --> 03:21.000
It looks like someone stuck
six packs of gum in my hair.

03:22.568 --> 03:24.500
I didn't see nothing.

03:24.502 --> 03:25.802
Tony,

03:25.804 --> 03:27.537
go to the office.

03:27.539 --> 03:29.074
Not again!

03:30.342 --> 03:32.345
Ow!

03:35.647 --> 03:37.483
You're dead, snitch!

03:43.655 --> 03:47.291
Ow. Ow!

03:53.399 --> 03:56.368
Holy crap, what's happening to me?

04:00.205 --> 04:03.242
Oh!

04:16.154 --> 04:19.022
Look at his shoes!

04:19.024 --> 04:20.860
Huh? What... What?

04:25.963 --> 04:27.096
Spaz alert.

04:27.098 --> 04:28.933
He used to be in my History class.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.267
That's why I changed classes.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.572
He's got like no friends.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.140
Hey, Adam. Are you okay?

04:37.142 --> 04:38.744
Don't run, I don't bite.

04:40.678 --> 04:42.546
Well, look who it is.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.380
How ya doing, snitch?

04:44.382 --> 04:45.984
Leave me alone.

04:55.661 --> 04:58.428
Hey there, mop-top, whatcha doin'?

04:58.430 --> 05:00.764
Are you on your way to
the janitor's closet?

05:00.766 --> 05:02.632
'Cause you look like a mop!

05:02.634 --> 05:04.968
Good one!

05:04.970 --> 05:06.635
Seriously, that counts as a good one?

05:06.637 --> 05:07.774
Give me a break!

05:08.473 --> 05:09.738
Good one!

05:09.740 --> 05:11.644
That's a good one.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.277
Get off me!

05:14.279 --> 05:16.312
What? You gonna rat me out again?

05:16.314 --> 05:19.416
Hard to say. It depends
on the circumstances.

05:19.418 --> 05:20.716
Wrong answer, snitch!

05:23.422 --> 05:24.657
Stop!

05:26.826 --> 05:28.158
Okay, you've had enough.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.163
Here, let me help you.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.234
Look at his shoes! What a freak!

05:36.267 --> 05:38.637
Oh, hey, you forgot your backpack!

05:40.773 --> 05:42.673
Cha-ching! Two points!

05:45.810 --> 05:47.112
Jerks...

05:52.517 --> 05:54.817
It was those boys again wasn't it?

05:54.819 --> 05:57.120
No, I told you. I was playing soccer

05:57.122 --> 05:59.223
with my friends and the
ball hit me in the face.

05:59.225 --> 06:02.493
Oh, yeah? What friends
of yours play soccer?

06:02.495 --> 06:04.795
Uh... The British ones...

06:04.797 --> 06:07.531
My mates. But they call soccer "football."

06:07.533 --> 06:10.634
Oh, do they? And how did this happen?

06:10.636 --> 06:12.803
Soccer can be a dangerous sport.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.204
Adam, quit messing around.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.207
What are we going to do about this?

06:17.209 --> 06:19.375
Either we chop it out, or we chew it out.

06:19.377 --> 06:20.810
I vote chew.

06:20.812 --> 06:23.348
Ugh. I vote chop.

06:25.283 --> 06:26.685
Turn around.

06:30.988 --> 06:33.859
You had such nice, long hair.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.745
At least they can't make
fun of my hair anymore.

07:16.999 --> 07:17.569
Holy crap!

07:19.737 --> 07:22.238
Adam, You're gonna be late!

07:22.240 --> 07:24.606
I'll be down in a minute!

07:31.083 --> 07:32.449
Adam...

07:32.451 --> 07:34.620
That's not gonna work.

07:36.488 --> 07:38.320
What's taking so long?

07:38.322 --> 07:39.889
Are you all right?

07:39.891 --> 07:41.492
I'm fine!

07:41.494 --> 07:43.459
I guess your meatloaf didn't agree with me.

07:43.461 --> 07:45.728
I thought you loved my meatloaf.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.764
Love is a strong word. I like it.

07:48.766 --> 07:50.636
No, like's too strong.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.637
Hey, I hate your meatloaf.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.870
What?

07:54.872 --> 07:56.539
Listen, my meatloaf is...

07:56.541 --> 07:58.207
Oh, Adam.

07:58.209 --> 08:00.243
- What?
- That hat...

08:00.245 --> 08:01.911
What about it?

08:01.913 --> 08:03.949
That was your father's.

08:11.456 --> 08:13.322
Oh, sorry.

08:13.324 --> 08:14.658
Why are you sorry?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.426
I dunno.

08:16.428 --> 08:19.562
He died. I didn't mean to make you sad.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.132
He was a great man.

08:23.134 --> 08:24.637
I wish I knew him.

08:27.572 --> 08:30.973
I did a sloppy job on your hair.

08:30.975 --> 08:34.177
I must have been more tired than I thought.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.878
Here, let's put this back on.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.182
It looks good on you.

08:39.518 --> 08:42.118
Now hurry up, you're going
to be late for school.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.521
I can't believe you don't like my meatloaf.

08:44.523 --> 08:46.289
I'll let you in on a secret, Mom.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.527
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

08:50.796 --> 08:54.330
Okay. Well, enjoy your lunch.

08:54.332 --> 08:55.799
It's meatloaf, isn't it?

08:55.801 --> 08:57.737
Mmm. Could be.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.777
<i>All powerful men have
one thing in common.</i>

09:07.779 --> 09:10.647
Great hair.

09:12.283 --> 09:14.783
HairCo toupees have been worn in secret

09:14.785 --> 09:16.555
by some of the greatest men in history.

09:21.058 --> 09:23.993
But you're not here to
be a part of our past,

09:23.995 --> 09:26.530
you're here to be part of the future.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.335
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
hair is a growth business.

09:35.941 --> 09:39.378
I'm afraid we'll need to
ask you for your cameras.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.959
Huh?

09:56.961 --> 09:59.963
Mr. Kobayashi, I must insist.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.734
Oh.

10:06.104 --> 10:07.573
Ooh.

10:10.875 --> 10:14.044
This is where the magic happens.

10:14.046 --> 10:18.015
The future isn't toupees, no, no, no.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.486
The future lies in growing real hair.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.522
We're not talking about
embarrassing hair plugs,

10:26.524 --> 10:29.792
useless scalp massagers, or fancy shampoo.

10:29.794 --> 10:32.396
We're talking about genetic engineering.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.632
State of the art DNA manipulation.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.733
We're on the verge of a major breakthrough

10:37.735 --> 10:40.939
that will change the lives of
hundreds of millions of people...

10:43.609 --> 10:46.844
And make us a fortune in the process.

11:02.628 --> 11:06.796
Dr. Billingsley is our head of
experimental research and development.

11:06.798 --> 11:11.100
Ah, here comes one of
our eager young interns.

11:11.102 --> 11:13.969
Uh, Dr. Billingsley?

11:13.971 --> 11:15.807
I'm getting college cedit for this, right?

11:16.441 --> 11:18.307
Of course.

11:18.309 --> 11:21.046
Oh, okay. I'll just need you to
sign my work experience time sheet.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.613
Stand on the "X."

11:23.615 --> 11:25.480
Hold on, you're not
going to shoot me with...

11:25.482 --> 11:26.783
Ow!

11:26.785 --> 11:28.186
Ouch!

11:30.522 --> 11:32.155
Oh.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.656
Whoa.

11:33.658 --> 11:36.092
Oh!

11:36.094 --> 11:37.594
Ooh.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.363
Now, you may experience a
slight burning sensation.

11:40.365 --> 11:42.100
But don't worry about it.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.938
Help me!

11:51.076 --> 11:53.576
As you can see,

11:53.578 --> 11:56.012
we're still perfecting the formula.

11:56.014 --> 11:59.848
Once we do, people will
pay anything for it.

11:59.850 --> 12:03.552
The real money is in big hair.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.631
Hmm. Reduce fluoroantimonic
acid by five percent.

12:17.802 --> 12:20.338
We have a no fighting
policy at this school,

12:21.472 --> 12:22.738
zero tolerance.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.474
You fight, you're suspended!

12:25.476 --> 12:27.576
You're suspended!

12:27.578 --> 12:30.180
Do you hear me? Suspended!

12:30.182 --> 12:33.182
You're so funny.

12:33.184 --> 12:35.687
Hey, you better watch your back, snitch.

12:40.725 --> 12:44.060
Adam Harrison.

12:44.062 --> 12:47.629
I believe this belongs to you.

12:47.631 --> 12:50.800
Nametag was on the inside.

12:50.802 --> 12:52.234
Oh, thank you, sir!

12:52.236 --> 12:55.772
Don't be throwing it into
basketball hoops anymore.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.041
What? Why would I throw my
own bag into a basketball hoop?

12:59.043 --> 13:02.280
Who knows why you kids do anything?

13:03.349 --> 13:07.116
Adam, you are what we call a...

13:07.118 --> 13:10.085
Mildred.

13:10.087 --> 13:14.925
Uh, what are we saying
instead of spazoid these days?

13:14.927 --> 13:18.060
Uh, normally challenged, sir.

13:18.062 --> 13:19.796
Oh, and, uh...

13:19.798 --> 13:22.732
How would I say "friendless loser"?

13:22.734 --> 13:26.969
Mid-level acquaintance deficiency.

13:28.639 --> 13:33.576
Adam, you have mid-level
acquaintance deficiency.

13:33.578 --> 13:35.378
Do they make a pill for that?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.280
No, sir.

13:37.282 --> 13:42.118
Apparently, there's
nothing we can do for you.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.153
This acting out needs to stop.

13:45.155 --> 13:46.522
But, sir...

13:46.524 --> 13:48.657
We have a no fighting
policy at this school.

13:48.659 --> 13:52.628
Zero tolerance. You
fight, you're suspended.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.063
Getting beat up counts as fighting?

13:54.065 --> 13:58.200
A fist can't punch without
a face to receive it.

13:58.202 --> 14:00.936
No fighting means no fighting.

14:00.938 --> 14:02.271
Oh, and, Adam?

14:02.273 --> 14:04.541
Yes, sir?

14:04.543 --> 14:08.276
We have zero tolerance on hats.

14:08.278 --> 14:10.946
No hats in school.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.451
And get a haircut.

14:15.453 --> 14:16.621
What...

14:18.856 --> 14:20.158
Hmm?

14:36.541 --> 14:39.642
Hey, Harrison, you got me suspended!

14:39.644 --> 14:41.945
You should be happy. You hate school.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.446
My dad's going to kill me.

14:43.448 --> 14:45.480
He's got a 10 strikes policy,

14:45.482 --> 14:46.784
and this is strike 10.

14:50.020 --> 14:53.757
Come on, guys, you heard Principal
Jones. He said no fighting.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.926
He said no fighting on school property.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.031
How do I look?

15:01.033 --> 15:02.665
You look like stupid Adam.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.199
This hat sucks.

15:06.169 --> 15:08.072
Stop!

15:09.441 --> 15:11.775
That's it, you're dead!

15:11.777 --> 15:13.575
Come on, let's get him!

15:27.759 --> 15:29.825
Come on, get him!

15:29.827 --> 15:31.694
Don't let him get away.

15:45.243 --> 15:47.911
Okay, guys, come on. You've had your fun.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.546
Don't you know how this works?

15:50.548 --> 15:51.980
We got him, boys!

15:51.982 --> 15:53.382
This is the fun part.

15:53.384 --> 15:55.584
Get off me!

16:03.561 --> 16:04.629
What the...

16:05.764 --> 16:07.265
Oh, oh...

16:08.500 --> 16:09.868
Come on!

16:21.913 --> 16:24.379
What is happening to me?

16:24.381 --> 16:25.583
Oh, no...

16:28.253 --> 16:29.989
You gotta come out sometime.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.026
Yeah, and when you do, we'll be waiting.

16:40.932 --> 16:44.400
It's Friday. He could
be in there all weekend.

16:44.402 --> 16:47.637
Are we really gonna
wait here for three days?

16:47.639 --> 16:49.238
Nah. Forget him.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.310
Let's go bug the goats at the petting zoo.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.580
- Were you ever going to tell me?
- Oh!

18:04.582 --> 18:07.717
Adam! You startled me.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.919
You said Dad was dead!

18:09.921 --> 18:13.590
- Adam...
- If he's dead, why is he writing letters to you?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.926
This one is from two weeks ago!

18:15.928 --> 18:17.460
"Dear Shelly, I'm sorry to hear

18:17.462 --> 18:19.461
"Adam is having a hard time at school."

18:19.463 --> 18:21.297
- Really?
- It's not what you think.

18:21.299 --> 18:23.266
You didn't think I'd want to meet him?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.734
You thought you could keep him to yourself?

18:24.736 --> 18:29.205
Adam, your dad is alive.

18:29.207 --> 18:30.507
That's all I can tell you.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.174
- Are you kidding me?
- I know it's hard,

18:33.176 --> 18:34.710
but you've got to trust me.

18:34.712 --> 18:37.345
Trust you! You're a liar!

18:37.347 --> 18:40.083
You've been lying to me
every day of my whole life!

18:40.085 --> 18:42.218
Adam, please...

18:42.220 --> 18:44.754
I thought you were the
one person I could trust,

18:44.756 --> 18:46.391
but you're just like everybody else.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.790
Hmm.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.759
I hate you!

18:50.761 --> 18:52.798
Adam, no, please...

19:40.144 --> 19:42.478
Hey, kid. You okay?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.279
Just trying to get home.

19:44.281 --> 19:46.815
Ain't you a little young to be hitchhiking?

19:46.817 --> 19:50.151
I'm a little young to be
stranded at the side of the road,

19:50.153 --> 19:52.688
catching a cold in the pouring rain.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.424
Yeah. I guess so. How far you goin'?

19:55.426 --> 19:58.026
Uh, Route 89.

19:58.028 --> 20:00.529
What? Are you kidding?
That's 100 miles from here.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.064
So can you take me?

20:02.066 --> 20:04.769
It's getting awfully cold out here.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.569
I don't know...

20:07.571 --> 20:09.238
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.674
Hey, I don't remember sayin' I'd take you.

20:11.676 --> 20:13.542
Oh, come on. You'd hate yourself

20:13.544 --> 20:17.345
if I died of pneumonia
and it was all your fault.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.117
All right! Close the door.

20:32.529 --> 20:36.165
Adam? Adam, are you awake?

20:36.167 --> 20:37.868
Can we talk about this?

20:42.673 --> 20:44.276
Adam?

20:47.678 --> 20:49.615
Oh, no, no, no!

20:55.153 --> 20:58.720
Well, you don't see many
forests like this anymore.

20:58.722 --> 21:03.392
Huh. You walk two weeks in any
direction, and all you'd see is trees.

21:03.394 --> 21:06.795
I'm telling you, you wouldn't want
to get turned around out here, kid.

21:06.797 --> 21:08.666
No, you wouldn't.

21:09.733 --> 21:12.401
Well, it looks like...

21:12.403 --> 21:14.839
Yes, it's here! This is it!

21:16.707 --> 21:18.774
This is it?

21:18.776 --> 21:21.179
I didn't know people
actually lived out here.

21:22.446 --> 21:25.449
Yep, uh, home sweet home.

21:27.417 --> 21:31.054
Home sweet home? Where's your house?

21:31.056 --> 21:34.457
My House... My house is
over there... Back a ways.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.557
Hmm.

21:35.559 --> 21:37.495
Anyway, thanks. See ya.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.900
Okay. Take care of yourself, kid.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.073
Hello?

21:49.907 --> 21:51.809
Hello?

22:13.999 --> 22:17.402
Where'd you go? Little squirrel dude?

22:19.503 --> 22:21.639
Hey, wait! Come back!

22:22.874 --> 22:24.774
That's not fair!

22:45.430 --> 22:48.567
Walk two weeks in any direction
and all you'll see is trees.

22:56.807 --> 22:58.143
Wow.

22:59.810 --> 23:01.509
Hello?

23:04.882 --> 23:07.085
Whoo!

23:13.590 --> 23:16.394
Hello? Somebody there?

23:18.896 --> 23:21.432
This isn't funny. Who's there?

23:33.344 --> 23:34.446
Whoa.

23:41.885 --> 23:45.086
<i>♪♪ She took my dog, my house</i>

23:45.088 --> 23:47.023
<i>♪♪ My pickup truck</i>

23:47.025 --> 23:50.492
<i>♪♪ But no matter what she say</i>

23:50.494 --> 23:52.594
<i>♪♪ Can't take my
cowboy boots away ♪♪</i>

23:52.596 --> 23:53.764
Whoa!

23:55.566 --> 23:58.236
Holy cow! What in the heck was that?

24:02.839 --> 24:04.940
Huh? Well, I'll be...

24:06.810 --> 24:11.080
No service? Come on, you piece of junk!

24:11.082 --> 24:14.083
Stupid smartphone!

24:16.586 --> 24:19.055
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

24:19.057 --> 24:22.224
My emergency is I done saw a bigfoot!

24:22.226 --> 24:24.626
I got the whole thing on my dashboard cam.

24:24.628 --> 24:29.431
<i>Bigfoot? Sir, this line is for
emergencies, not for prank calls.</i>

24:29.433 --> 24:30.769
Hello?

24:31.335 --> 24:32.969
Hello?

24:32.971 --> 24:36.307
Dang blame it, somebody's
got to believe me.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.412
National Enquirer,
<i>how can I help you?</i>

24:44.414 --> 24:46.915
Don't hang up. You gotta believe me.

24:46.917 --> 24:50.318
I'm calling 'cause I saw a real bigfoot.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.254
<i>Please hold, and
I'll put you through</i>

24:52.256 --> 24:54.793
<i>to Hairy Monsters,
Swampthings, and UFOs.</i>

24:56.160 --> 24:57.427
Bigfoot?

24:57.429 --> 24:59.428
Yes. Bigfoot.

24:59.430 --> 25:03.165
It's a dead end. We gave up the
search for Bigfoot 10 years ago.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.134
With all due respect, if this
thing is real, we have to have it.

25:06.136 --> 25:08.469
It's the genetic bridge
we've been looking for.

25:08.471 --> 25:14.209
Oh, no, no. I'm not wasting a
fortune on another wild goose chase.

25:14.211 --> 25:17.380
Think of the hair growth
potential locked in that DNA.

25:17.382 --> 25:20.516
No more sprays. No more toupees.

25:20.518 --> 25:22.151
Just real hair.

25:22.153 --> 25:25.187
Come on, Billingsley. You're a scientist.

25:25.189 --> 25:29.025
What makes you so sure this
isn't just another hoax?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.625
Looking at the kid in this photo,

25:30.627 --> 25:32.496
could there be any other conclusion?

25:36.468 --> 25:38.167
Hmm.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.701
Is that who I think it is?

25:40.703 --> 25:42.371
We think so.

25:42.373 --> 25:45.141
Then I only have one more question...

25:45.143 --> 25:47.913
Who took this photo?

25:49.880 --> 25:52.114
So, sugar, you say you saw Bigfoot?

25:52.116 --> 25:54.784
- Yes, ma'am.
- And it's going to be in the paper?

25:54.786 --> 25:57.219
- That's what they said.
- Ooh! You going to be famous.

25:57.221 --> 26:00.890
It's so exciting. Nothing
ever happens up here.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.427
This is going to be good for business.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.096
Huh? Oh, what's that?

26:10.034 --> 26:11.400
What did I tell you?

26:11.402 --> 26:12.701
- Teddy!
- What?

26:12.703 --> 26:14.335
Raise the prices!

26:14.337 --> 26:16.604
It happened right here.

26:16.606 --> 26:18.074
Check out them skids.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.376
I hit the brakes so hard,
I almost flipped my rig!

26:21.378 --> 26:22.813
Sir...

26:23.881 --> 26:25.450
We got something.

26:26.616 --> 26:28.683
Mmm.

26:31.721 --> 26:32.790
Hello?

26:33.625 --> 26:35.093
Mrs. Harrison?

26:43.667 --> 26:44.868
Check the house.

27:06.891 --> 27:08.390
I think we got something.

27:08.392 --> 27:10.394
Car's gone. No sign of the mother.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.476
Stay away from me! Help!

27:31.147 --> 27:33.649
Don't come any closer!

27:33.651 --> 27:35.985
What... What are you?

27:35.987 --> 27:37.452
Well, I'm, uh...

27:37.454 --> 27:39.086
I'm not sure how to break this to you...

27:39.088 --> 27:41.489
But I'm your dad.

27:41.491 --> 27:44.093
Dad? No, you're not!

27:44.095 --> 27:46.996
Where is he? What did you
do with him? Did you eat him?

27:46.998 --> 27:50.266
No, I promise, Adam. I'm your dad.

27:50.268 --> 27:54.335
Stop saying that! And back off!

27:54.337 --> 27:57.739
Ooh, easy, killer. Don't twig me to death.

27:57.741 --> 27:59.610
Calm down, you have nothing to fear.

28:00.577 --> 28:02.010
Where did you get these?

28:02.012 --> 28:03.345
Your mother sent them to me.

28:03.347 --> 28:05.015
I hate this picture.

28:06.984 --> 28:08.584
- That's you?
- Yep.

28:08.586 --> 28:10.920
It's you, me, and your mom.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.521
You were six months old.

28:13.523 --> 28:14.823
Oh, man...

28:14.825 --> 28:16.692
My dad is Bigfoot?

28:16.694 --> 28:19.961
- Yep.
- Could my life get any worse?

28:19.963 --> 28:23.466
"Hey, Adam, your dad's famous,
but not like a rock star,

28:23.468 --> 28:27.068
"more like a hideous beast
that hides in the forest."

28:27.070 --> 28:29.037
Hideous? That's a bit strong.

28:29.039 --> 28:31.474
Are you kidding? You're a monster.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.807
I can see why you ran away.

28:32.809 --> 28:36.077
Whoa. I didn't leave because I'm a bigfoot.

28:36.079 --> 28:38.547
I left because I was being hunted.

28:38.549 --> 28:40.382
- Hunted?
- You see,

28:40.384 --> 28:44.420
a pharmaceutical company wanted
to turn me into a lab rat.

28:44.422 --> 28:47.390
I left to protect you and your mother.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.292
We didn't tell you for your own safety.

28:50.294 --> 28:51.763
What do you mean, a lab rat?

28:53.029 --> 28:54.997
Does your mom know you're out here?

28:54.999 --> 28:56.865
Yeah. She gave me the address.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.566
She told me to come out here...

28:58.568 --> 29:00.068
Alone.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.970
Adam, you're lying to me.

29:01.972 --> 29:04.338
You and mom have been
lying to me my entire life.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.040
We had no choice.

29:06.042 --> 29:08.544
You have no idea how
hard it was on both of us.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.179
What about me?

29:10.181 --> 29:13.649
It broke my heart that I couldn't
be there when you needed me.

29:13.651 --> 29:16.184
Adam, this is serious.

29:16.186 --> 29:17.518
Tell me how you found me.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.287
I found your letters.

29:19.289 --> 29:21.225
You took a big risk coming here.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.894
Your mom must be worried sick.

29:25.730 --> 29:27.296
Hmm?

29:36.807 --> 29:38.806
- What's going on?
- Just a routine check.

29:38.808 --> 29:41.178
Routine? It doesn't look that way to me.

29:41.945 --> 29:43.245
Are you Shelly Harrison?

29:43.247 --> 29:46.414
What? Are you a police officer?

29:46.416 --> 29:48.883
I'm going to have to ask you to turn off
your engine and step out of the vehicle.

29:48.885 --> 29:50.454
Hmm. Okay.

29:54.090 --> 29:55.958
Ma'am, it's futile.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.961
I suggest you get out of the car.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.796
She sent me everything.

30:01.798 --> 30:04.600
I couldn't get enough of
it. She's so proud of you.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.567
I always thought Mom threw these out.

30:06.569 --> 30:08.103
Not a single one of them.

30:08.105 --> 30:09.638
So what about me?

30:09.640 --> 30:12.540
Am I gonna be... Like you?

30:12.542 --> 30:15.143
No. You've got nothing to worry about.

30:15.145 --> 30:16.644
You're already 13...

30:16.646 --> 30:18.546
- So what?
- Well...

30:18.548 --> 30:20.181
You'd have symptoms by now.

30:20.183 --> 30:22.617
Oh, you mean like hair
that grows a foot overnight?

30:22.619 --> 30:24.686
Feet that blow through
the ends of my shoes?

30:24.688 --> 30:25.990
That kind of thing?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.091
I'm going to be a monster?

30:29.093 --> 30:31.093
It's not so bad.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.928
How is it not so bad?

30:32.930 --> 30:35.965
Spending the rest of my life
hiding in the forest like an animal?

30:35.967 --> 30:38.934
Slow down. What else do you have?

30:38.936 --> 30:42.871
The hair thing, the feet.
What about your ears?

30:42.873 --> 30:46.642
When your adrenaline's up,
does your hearing change?

30:46.644 --> 30:48.643
Sometimes it gets super loud.

30:48.645 --> 30:50.379
Like a migraine or something.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.314
When's the last time you shaved your hands?

30:52.316 --> 30:53.649
What? Ew! Never!

30:53.651 --> 30:54.815
But you shave your back?

30:54.817 --> 30:56.651
No. I don't shave anything.

30:56.653 --> 31:00.456
This is amazing. My hands
and back are where it started.

31:00.458 --> 31:04.860
By the time I was 12, I was waxing
my back every weekend with duct tape.

31:04.862 --> 31:06.661
But you're different.

31:06.663 --> 31:08.764
It's like you've got all the
good stuff, but none of the fur.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.100
How is any of this "good stuff"?

31:11.102 --> 31:14.370
There's a lot of good
things about being a bigfoot.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.975
You're standing on that leg, aren't you?

31:37.894 --> 31:40.362
You... You fixed my leg.

31:40.364 --> 31:41.930
How is that possible?

31:41.932 --> 31:45.334
The healing touch, fast
growing hair, big feet...

31:45.336 --> 31:47.201
It all goes with the territory.

31:47.203 --> 31:49.337
Holy moly. What are you?

31:49.339 --> 31:51.172
Some kind of hairy wizard?

31:51.174 --> 31:54.008
Ha. Nothing that exciting.

31:54.010 --> 31:56.513
We've got to find out what else you can do.

31:57.314 --> 31:58.615
Hang on to this.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.051
What's it do?

32:10.727 --> 32:12.130
Whoo-hoo!

32:16.500 --> 32:17.766
Whoo-hoo!

32:26.943 --> 32:28.011
Whoa!

32:37.288 --> 32:40.825
Whoa!

32:47.330 --> 32:48.765
What's going on? It hurts!

32:55.605 --> 32:57.472
Just relax...

32:57.474 --> 33:00.275
That was so irresponsible!
You could've killed me!

33:00.277 --> 33:02.276
It's the adrenaline.

33:02.278 --> 33:04.313
Calm down.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.780
Take a deep breath.

33:06.782 --> 33:09.486
That's it. And listen.

33:15.893 --> 33:18.293
Whoa. It's a woodpecker.

33:18.295 --> 33:19.663
Focus over there.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.273
That's a... What do you call it?

33:31.275 --> 33:33.776
- A geyser.
- It's like I can see it.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.777
The sound makes a picture in your head.

33:35.779 --> 33:39.549
Dolphins and bats have something
similar called echolocation.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.816
Pretty cool, Huh?

33:41.818 --> 33:45.019
I guess. Well, Batman's cool...

33:45.021 --> 33:46.453
Dolphinman, not so much.

33:46.455 --> 33:48.556
And your feet... Tell me you've tried them?

33:48.558 --> 33:49.826
Ditch the shoes, buddy.

33:53.363 --> 33:54.863
- Ah!
- What?

33:54.865 --> 33:56.030
It's cold.

33:56.032 --> 33:59.000
- Try to keep up.
- Huh?

33:59.002 --> 34:00.969
- Whoo-hoo!
- Wait!

34:17.018 --> 34:18.286
Whoo-hoo!

34:18.288 --> 34:20.289
This is amazing!

34:20.291 --> 34:21.856
Feels good, doesn't it?

34:21.858 --> 34:24.228
Yeah! It's the greatest feeling in the...

34:28.364 --> 34:29.933
Whoo-hoo!

34:36.572 --> 34:38.072
Whoo!

34:41.710 --> 34:42.880
Whoo!

34:48.018 --> 34:49.719
Whoo-hoo! Oh!

34:50.253 --> 34:51.920
Whoo...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.456
Ouch, buddy. Oh.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.925
I'm so sorry. I should've warned you.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.528
You've gotta avoid smashing
head first into the trees.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.099
I think I'm done with
bigfoot lessons for the day.

35:04.101 --> 35:05.566
There's one more thing.

35:05.568 --> 35:07.570
Does it involve smashing
head first into anything?

35:07.572 --> 35:10.271
Nope. I can talk to animals.

35:10.273 --> 35:11.438
Are you kidding?

35:11.440 --> 35:12.874
Just watch.

35:12.876 --> 35:14.575
Hey, Steve, come over here.

35:25.755 --> 35:27.889
So what did you say to her?

35:27.891 --> 35:30.726
I love it.

35:30.728 --> 35:33.394
I just hear chirps. I
guess I don't have that one.

35:33.396 --> 35:37.869
Give it a shot. The secret
here is to slow things down.

35:45.608 --> 35:47.075
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

35:47.077 --> 35:49.177
You look better in real
life than in your photo.

35:49.179 --> 35:50.979
- No way.
- Yes way.

35:50.981 --> 35:52.280
It works!

35:52.282 --> 35:55.184
It... Is... Nice... To... Meet... You!

35:55.186 --> 35:57.284
You don't need to talk like that.

35:57.286 --> 35:58.753
They understand you just fine.

35:58.755 --> 36:01.155
What am I? Chopped liver?

36:01.157 --> 36:04.425
Sheesh. He doesn't even introduce me!

36:04.427 --> 36:06.260
The trees talk too?

36:06.262 --> 36:07.664
This place is like a Disney movie!

36:08.766 --> 36:11.266
Hello... Oh!

36:11.268 --> 36:14.336
Trees don't talk, you stupid idiot.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.936
That's just Trapper.

36:17.673 --> 36:19.773
<i>Enchante.</i> Ow!

36:19.775 --> 36:22.577
Oh, yeah. This is my lovely wife, Weecha.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.179
She's also <i>enchanted.</i>

36:24.181 --> 36:25.780
Oh. Hello.

36:25.782 --> 36:27.416
Nice to finally meet you, Adam.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.851
Your dad talks about you all the time.

36:29.853 --> 36:31.452
Every real man has a son.

36:31.454 --> 36:33.354
I got kids on the way myself.

36:33.356 --> 36:34.789
All boys.

36:34.791 --> 36:36.490
We don't know that.

36:36.492 --> 36:38.325
I can tell.

36:38.327 --> 36:41.398
How you doin', fellas? Gettin'
big and strong in there? Good.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.164
I have to say...

36:44.166 --> 36:46.668
- The kid doesn't look like a bigfoot.
- Trapper!

36:46.670 --> 36:48.704
What? I'm just calling it like it is.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.907
You've all got eyes. This is a bigfoot.

36:51.909 --> 36:54.742
This is a boy. It's Humans 101.

36:54.744 --> 36:58.012
Don't listen to Trapper. Nobody here does.

36:58.014 --> 37:01.182
Are you kidding? I'm
like the boss around here!

37:01.184 --> 37:04.485
Everybody in this forest
hangs off my every word.

37:04.487 --> 37:07.289
Is he always like that?

37:07.291 --> 37:08.726
What a place.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.762
I'm starting to like it here.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.869
Don't run and don't turn your back to him.

37:20.570 --> 37:22.707
Oh, no. He's a big one!

37:25.909 --> 37:27.545
Careful, Dad! Don't...

37:35.052 --> 37:38.753
Nice performance, Wilbur. 10 out of 10!

37:38.755 --> 37:42.224
Well, thanks. I've been practicing.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.860
You jerk! I almost had a heart attack.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.360
Nothing to be afraid of.

37:46.362 --> 37:48.063
This is just Wilbur.

37:48.065 --> 37:51.298
He's a big teddy bear,
sweeter than a pot of honey.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.969
I am not!

37:53.802 --> 37:56.438
Okay, maybe I am.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.972
This is my son, Adam.

37:57.974 --> 38:00.307
Pleased to meet you, kid.

38:00.309 --> 38:02.411
Over the hill...

38:02.413 --> 38:04.880
Oh, hello.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.215
- Two of 'em...
- Wow, slow down, Tina.

38:07.217 --> 38:09.083
Breathe through your nose.

38:09.085 --> 38:11.387
I ain't got time to
breathe through my nose!

38:11.389 --> 38:13.921
I'm talkin' about rednecks with guns!

38:13.923 --> 38:16.791
Hoo-hoo, hunters!

38:16.793 --> 38:18.559
Hunters? Should we hide?

38:18.561 --> 38:21.298
That won't be necessary.

38:23.199 --> 38:25.867
I, my friend, am a connoisseur

38:25.869 --> 38:27.769
and when it comes to hamburgers,

38:27.771 --> 38:31.539
this is a tasty piece of beef.

38:31.541 --> 38:33.874
I thought you got the fried chicken.

38:33.876 --> 38:38.313
My point is, whatever
it is, it's delicious.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.786
We haven't had hunters in three seasons!

38:44.621 --> 38:47.521
Blue 32. Green 180. Hut!

38:48.958 --> 38:50.758
Yee-haw!

38:50.760 --> 38:53.961
You think that'd be cruelty
to animals, but she loves it.

38:57.701 --> 38:59.534
My point is,

38:59.536 --> 39:01.503
we're smarter than them animals,

39:01.505 --> 39:04.508
so they deserve to die.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.657
That's the sign.

39:31.135 --> 39:34.202
It's a dog-eat-dog
world, my friend,

39:34.204 --> 39:35.936
but I ain't eatin' no dog.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.106
Which brings me back to my hamburger.

39:38.108 --> 39:39.974
That would be a chicken burger.

39:39.976 --> 39:41.345
Whatever burger.

39:58.561 --> 39:59.563
Oh!

40:00.230 --> 40:01.599
I got it!

40:02.331 --> 40:03.600
I saw it first!

40:09.940 --> 40:12.541
We got him, my friend!

40:12.543 --> 40:16.411
I told you dousing
ourselves in that bear urine

40:16.413 --> 40:18.079
would make us in-detectable.

40:18.081 --> 40:19.514
Like the Invisible Man.

40:19.516 --> 40:22.184
Ooh, you were right about that one, buddy.

40:22.186 --> 40:25.586
All we gotta do before we mount it
on the wall is make sure it's dead.

40:25.588 --> 40:26.957
Let's take a look.

40:29.192 --> 40:31.159
Yup. He's a goner.

40:31.161 --> 40:36.097
I love destroying nature's
most majestic creatures!

40:36.099 --> 40:39.367
Come on, get your butt
in here. Selfie time!

40:44.407 --> 40:47.108
<i>I'm gonna post that up on Facebook,</i>

40:47.110 --> 40:48.876
<i>and watch the likes come rollin' in.</i>

40:48.878 --> 40:50.912
<i>Oh, don't you be tagging me!</i>

40:50.914 --> 40:53.615
<i>My wife thinks I'm down at the
community college studyin' to be an...</i>

40:57.621 --> 41:00.423
Zombie bear!

41:01.291 --> 41:02.927
He's undead!

41:04.827 --> 41:06.362
I did poke it!

41:13.670 --> 41:16.204
And stay out!

41:16.206 --> 41:18.539
Nice shot, honey.

41:18.541 --> 41:22.443
They won't be coming back for a while.

41:22.445 --> 41:25.648
That was the best thing I've ever seen!

41:28.952 --> 41:30.818
At least you guys know
how to have a good time.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.554
We make the most of it.

41:33.556 --> 41:35.557
It's nice to finally have a dad.

41:35.559 --> 41:38.492
Well, then, son, we've got
to make up for lost time.

41:38.494 --> 41:40.494
All right. Where do we start?

41:40.496 --> 41:42.264
I don't know.

41:42.266 --> 41:47.836
Okay, so what's the best
father-son thing you can think of?

41:47.838 --> 41:50.804
Hmm... Uh... Want to play baseball?

41:50.806 --> 41:53.510
- Sure, why not? You got a ball?
- Hmm.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.646
Whoa, I would have picked
a different activity

41:58.648 --> 42:01.115
if I'd known you had to
whittle a ball from scratch.

42:01.117 --> 42:02.684
That's how things work around here.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.385
You have to rely on yourself.

42:04.387 --> 42:06.820
Yeah. I guess you can't just
order it off the Internet.

42:06.822 --> 42:09.057
What's the Internet?

42:09.059 --> 42:11.726
You've never heard of the
Internet? Are you kidding me?

42:11.728 --> 42:13.327
Adam, I'm joking.

42:13.329 --> 42:15.963
I know what the Internet is. Come on!

42:15.965 --> 42:18.701
I have tons of friends on MySpace.

42:19.936 --> 42:22.769
Things have changed a little bit.

42:22.771 --> 42:24.137
You'll see when you come back.

42:24.139 --> 42:26.509
Oh, Adam, I told you. I can't.

42:27.844 --> 42:30.878
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.516
Come on, son, show me what you got.

42:33.449 --> 42:34.849
Okay, Pops.

42:36.786 --> 42:37.987
Huh?

42:44.626 --> 42:47.561
Whoa, maybe we should try something else.

42:47.563 --> 42:48.729
Hmm.

42:48.731 --> 42:50.467
Whoo-hoo!

42:51.168 --> 42:52.469
Whoo!

43:05.447 --> 43:07.250
Whoa, that felt great.

43:13.422 --> 43:15.691
Ah, come on out, I'll race you back.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.626
All right, old man, bring it on.

43:27.237 --> 43:29.170
Give me a second.

43:29.172 --> 43:31.505
What's wrong, gettin' tired?

43:31.507 --> 43:33.074
You wish.

43:33.076 --> 43:34.742
Whoo-hoo!

43:34.744 --> 43:36.614
Hey, no fair!

43:49.893 --> 43:52.260
You totally cheated!

43:52.262 --> 43:54.431
We'll call it a tie.

43:55.264 --> 43:57.632
Whoa! Did you make this?

43:57.634 --> 44:00.101
Sure did. So do you play?

44:00.103 --> 44:01.838
Oh, yeah. I love guitar!

44:07.911 --> 44:09.510
Yeah, uh,

44:09.512 --> 44:11.646
try not squeezing so tight.

44:11.648 --> 44:15.452
Yeah, leave a little
space... Yeah, yeah. Oh. Okay.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.287
I think it's out of tune or something.

44:20.289 --> 44:23.124
Do you play or is it just to look cool?

44:23.126 --> 44:25.362
Well, you'll be the judge.

44:48.150 --> 44:49.684
Holy crap!

44:49.686 --> 44:52.019
Well, I've had lots of time to practice.

44:52.021 --> 44:54.021
Can you teach me how to do that?

44:54.023 --> 44:56.990
Well, maybe a little
bit more rock and roll.

44:56.992 --> 44:58.895
Of course, I'd be happy to.

45:04.534 --> 45:06.066
You have to come home with me.

45:06.068 --> 45:10.037
Oh, Adam, I wish I
could, but it's not safe.

45:10.039 --> 45:13.507
We can keep you a secret.
No one will ever know.

45:13.509 --> 45:15.342
They don't even know you're alive!

45:15.344 --> 45:17.043
HairCo will find out.

45:17.045 --> 45:19.646
I'm sure they've been
monitoring you and your mom.

45:19.648 --> 45:23.584
They're relentless. I've seen it firsthand.

45:23.586 --> 45:25.485
When I was in medical school,

45:25.487 --> 45:27.454
<i>I started studying my hair growth,</i>

45:27.456 --> 45:31.325
<i>desperately trying to make sense
of what was happening to me.</i>

45:31.327 --> 45:34.628
<i>I discovered a rare DNA
mutation in my blood</i>

45:34.630 --> 45:38.066
<i>was triggering a resurgence
of Neanderthal features.</i>

45:38.068 --> 45:40.504
<i>Every day I was becoming
more of a bigfoot.</i>

45:41.737 --> 45:44.472
<i>HairCo found out
about my experiments.</i>

45:44.474 --> 45:47.474
<i>At first they tried to hire me</i>

45:47.476 --> 45:50.545
<i>but when I declined,
my lab was ransacked,</i>

45:50.547 --> 45:53.414
<i>and all my research stolen.</i>

45:53.416 --> 45:55.749
<i>That's when things got
really out of control.</i>

45:55.751 --> 45:57.584
<i>They threatened your mother.</i>

45:57.586 --> 46:00.454
<i>We couldn't go anywhere
without being followed.</i>

46:00.456 --> 46:04.592
I knew the only way to keep
you safe was to disappear.

46:04.594 --> 46:08.128
Why didn't they come after me?
Don't we have the same, uh...

46:08.130 --> 46:11.398
DNA. Yes, we do, but when you were younger,

46:11.400 --> 46:14.300
the genetic mutation hadn't activated yet.

46:14.302 --> 46:18.606
I'm sure they found some of your genetic
material when they ransacked the house.

46:18.608 --> 46:21.474
But back then, you'd have
seemed totally normal.

46:21.476 --> 46:23.077
That must be why they left us alone.

46:23.079 --> 46:25.746
And it's the reason I can't come back.

46:25.748 --> 46:28.583
It's too dangerous. If
they even suspect I'm alive,

46:28.585 --> 46:30.753
they'll stop at nothing
to get what they want.

46:35.224 --> 46:36.391
You.

46:36.393 --> 46:37.691
What are you doing here?

46:37.693 --> 46:39.927
All day breakfast, of course.

46:39.929 --> 46:43.697
I jest. Please sit, Mrs. Harrison,

46:43.699 --> 46:47.469
so that we might solve the
problem of your missing boy.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.771
He hates that photo.

46:49.773 --> 46:52.106
You expect me to believe
you're here because of my son?

46:52.108 --> 46:53.575
Oh, you got me.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.543
I don't care about your son,

46:55.545 --> 46:58.849
but if we find him, we find your husband.

46:59.614 --> 47:01.282
My husband?

47:01.284 --> 47:03.351
He died a long time ago. You know that.

47:03.353 --> 47:05.253
Yes, well... No.

47:05.255 --> 47:08.992
Some new evidence has come to my
attention. Please read the headline.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.961
"Baby born in a pumpkin."

47:13.262 --> 47:15.364
The other headline.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.700
Bigfoot? Really?

47:19.702 --> 47:24.771
Before he disappeared, your husband
was working on strange experiments.

47:24.773 --> 47:29.144
Studying hair growth.
Hair like we've never seen.

47:29.146 --> 47:32.015
Hair like that of say, a bigfoot.

47:33.617 --> 47:36.517
Quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

47:36.519 --> 47:42.289
Your son happens to show up at the
first Bigfoot sighting in 10 years?

47:42.291 --> 47:45.293
I don't think your husband
was studying Bigfoot.

47:45.295 --> 47:47.764
I think he is Bigfoot.

47:50.367 --> 47:53.800
Ta-da! And you said I don't
wine and dine you anymore.

47:53.802 --> 47:55.769
Something isn't right.

47:55.771 --> 47:57.673
I thought you might say that.

47:58.474 --> 48:00.342
Perfect-issimo.

48:00.344 --> 48:03.744
A beautiful meal for my beautiful wife,

48:03.746 --> 48:06.079
and my
soon-to-be-born sons.

48:06.081 --> 48:09.217
Eat up boys, no runts in this litter!

48:09.219 --> 48:14.458
Shh, I'm serious. What are all
these black cars doing here?

48:16.659 --> 48:17.960
Oh, no.

48:19.161 --> 48:21.729
I know. He hates that photo.

48:26.670 --> 48:29.737
That's Bigfoot's wife.

48:29.739 --> 48:31.871
We're not leaving until we find him.

48:31.873 --> 48:35.011
Tear the forest down if you have to.

48:37.146 --> 48:39.648
Yuck. Looks way too healthy.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.883
Well, it is. And tastes good too.

48:41.885 --> 48:43.650
Ooh, don't you have any meat?

48:43.652 --> 48:45.253
I'm afraid not.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.889
You kind of have to be
a vegetarian out here.

48:47.891 --> 48:51.258
You eat one of those guys and
everyone starts asking questions.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.161
Oh, no, who ate Trapper?

48:53.163 --> 48:56.597
Where's Trapper? Have you seen Trapper?

48:56.599 --> 48:58.398
You can try to reason with them,

48:58.400 --> 49:00.900
but nobody cares that he's delicious.

49:00.902 --> 49:02.135
I am trying to tell them, you know,

49:02.137 --> 49:04.572
a little salt and pepper
on the old Trapper,

49:04.574 --> 49:07.208
it's so good. They don't want to hear it.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.646
Oh, I see how that could be awkward.

49:10.213 --> 49:11.612
Whoa, hot.

49:11.614 --> 49:13.481
Hot but good, right?

49:13.483 --> 49:15.215
No... Just hot.

49:15.217 --> 49:16.617
You have to admit,

49:16.619 --> 49:18.086
it's better than Mom's meatloaf.

49:18.088 --> 49:21.155
I'll give you that. What
is in that stuff anyway?

49:21.157 --> 49:24.925
Car tires, wet cardboard
boxes and lots of ketchup.

49:29.398 --> 49:31.231
We got a big problem.

49:31.233 --> 49:32.867
What's this?

49:32.869 --> 49:34.434
We saw Adam's mom. They
got her locked in a trailer.

49:34.436 --> 49:35.637
- Shelly?
- Mom?

49:35.639 --> 49:37.438
Hold on, it gets worse.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.009
There are a bazillion dudes
in suits heading this way.

49:51.721 --> 49:53.420
I'm sorry... I...

49:53.422 --> 49:55.255
You led them right to us.

49:55.257 --> 49:58.958
And what's worse, you
put your mother in danger!

49:58.960 --> 50:00.929
- I...
- Adam, what have you done?

50:00.931 --> 50:02.229
I didn't mean to.

50:02.231 --> 50:05.099
Actions have consequences.

50:05.101 --> 50:08.001
You should never have come here.

50:08.003 --> 50:10.271
Well, you better do something.

50:10.273 --> 50:13.606
If they find Bigfoot, the jig is up!

50:13.608 --> 50:14.708
I can fix this!

50:14.710 --> 50:15.976
What are you doing?

50:15.978 --> 50:17.612
I'll tell them I'm okay. It'll be fine.

50:17.614 --> 50:19.780
No, Adam, you don't know
who you're dealing with...

50:27.722 --> 50:28.858
Please be safe.

50:30.693 --> 50:32.492
Over here, you found me!

50:32.494 --> 50:35.028
Adam Harrison, the missing boy.

50:35.030 --> 50:37.634
Everything's fine. We can all go home. Oh!

50:47.777 --> 50:49.476
Mom!

50:49.478 --> 50:51.278
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.981
I'm sorry, Mom. I shouldn't have run away.

50:53.983 --> 50:55.516
And I should've told you the truth.

50:55.518 --> 50:58.385
There's a hundred agents in
the forest looking for Dad.

50:58.387 --> 51:00.688
Adam, shh, watch what you say.

51:00.690 --> 51:02.389
Don't worry, they'll never find him.

51:02.391 --> 51:05.492
He's hiding in the tunnels
near the base of the waterfall.

51:05.494 --> 51:07.695
Hmm.

51:07.697 --> 51:09.930
This is an all-call.

51:09.932 --> 51:14.168
All agents re-route to sector G16.

51:14.170 --> 51:19.840
<i>I repeat, the prize is
in G16. I'm on my way.</i>

51:19.842 --> 51:24.577
You heard the man, turn
it around. Double time.

51:24.579 --> 51:27.983
The bigfoot is hiding down there.

51:31.588 --> 51:34.088
What are you waiting for? Get down there!

51:34.090 --> 51:35.688
I hear something.

51:35.690 --> 51:38.025
What is it?

51:48.070 --> 51:50.604
Someone push you in the pool?

51:50.606 --> 51:53.240
Adam! Don't hurt him! Please!

51:53.242 --> 51:55.709
Take her home. The boy rides with me.

51:55.711 --> 51:57.278
Where are you taking him?

51:57.280 --> 52:00.447
Don't worry, we'll be right behind you.

52:00.449 --> 52:03.286
We're going to have a little chat.

52:23.306 --> 52:26.407
One last chance. Where is your father?

52:26.409 --> 52:28.441
So you can lock him in a cage?

52:28.443 --> 52:31.679
Your father's DNA can
help millions of people.

52:31.681 --> 52:35.816
People who just want a
full head of healthy hair.

52:35.818 --> 52:38.586
So you just take some DNA and let him go?

52:38.588 --> 52:41.655
Not exactly. We'll be partners.

52:41.657 --> 52:44.925
Your dad will work exclusively for us.

52:44.927 --> 52:46.392
Give me a break.

52:46.394 --> 52:47.829
Adam, listen to me...

52:47.831 --> 52:49.998
He's not a lab rat. He's my dad!

52:53.436 --> 52:58.175
It's becoming clear to me that you
have no interest in negotiating.

52:58.974 --> 53:00.809
<i>Light it up, boys.</i>

53:05.514 --> 53:07.280
Are you crazy?

53:07.282 --> 53:12.086
Crazy is such an ugly
word. I prefer "motivated."

53:12.088 --> 53:14.387
You'll never catch him. There's
too much forest out there.

53:14.389 --> 53:18.761
Oh, my boy, the fire's
not for him. It's for you.

53:26.001 --> 53:27.901
Nice doing business with you.

53:27.903 --> 53:29.135
No!

53:30.672 --> 53:32.575
Oh.

53:53.496 --> 53:55.264
Help! Help me!

54:14.483 --> 54:15.452
Dad!

54:15.952 --> 54:17.254
Hang on!

54:24.793 --> 54:25.828
No!

54:27.630 --> 54:30.130
So predictable.

54:30.132 --> 54:32.802
Dad. Come on. Please.

54:49.952 --> 54:50.954
Dad!

55:02.731 --> 55:05.601
Mission accomplished. So long!

55:16.411 --> 55:17.846
Wake up, Adam.

55:21.617 --> 55:22.819
Wake up.

55:23.286 --> 55:24.684
Dad?

55:24.686 --> 55:27.354
He's awake. Are you okay?

55:27.356 --> 55:29.757
I... I think so.

55:29.759 --> 55:32.927
All right, then. Take
care of yourself, kid.

55:32.929 --> 55:34.929
Wait, where are you going?

55:34.931 --> 55:37.331
To find a new place to start over.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.532
You're just going to leave?

55:38.534 --> 55:40.467
Well, not much left here for us, is there?

55:40.469 --> 55:41.471
Way to go, man.

55:47.443 --> 55:49.179
Hey! Wait.

55:50.346 --> 55:51.778
Stop.

55:53.849 --> 55:55.749
Hey, I said stop!

55:59.856 --> 56:01.255
Huh?

56:01.257 --> 56:03.190
If you're going to bite my head off, do it.

56:03.192 --> 56:04.960
Otherwise, I've got something to say.

56:07.429 --> 56:10.164
I've got a plan but I need your help.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.501
It's your problem, not ours.

56:14.137 --> 56:16.970
This isn't about me, it's about my dad.

56:16.972 --> 56:19.874
I made the mistake, he
shouldn't have to pay for it.

56:19.876 --> 56:23.311
So you want us to bail you out now? Nice.

56:23.313 --> 56:25.179
I didn't mean for this to happen.

56:25.181 --> 56:28.481
I just came out here to
find my family. I'm sorry.

56:28.483 --> 56:31.318
Sorry isn't going to
unburn down our forest!

56:31.320 --> 56:35.322
If I could take it back,
I would. But I can't.

56:35.324 --> 56:37.657
Please, guys, I need your help.

56:37.659 --> 56:40.092
When animals go up against humans,

56:40.094 --> 56:41.994
humans always win.

56:41.996 --> 56:45.065
I'm not gonna end up a bearskin rug.

56:45.067 --> 56:47.735
What would Bigfoot do
if you were in trouble?

56:47.737 --> 56:49.369
Would he just walk away?

56:49.371 --> 56:51.905
Sometimes doing the right thing is hard.

56:51.907 --> 56:54.974
I'm not going to tell
you it won't be dangerous.

56:54.976 --> 56:57.845
But the only way we stand a
chance is if we work together.

56:57.847 --> 57:00.717
Please, Bigfoot needs your help.

57:02.385 --> 57:05.751
The kid's right. Bigfoot needs us.

57:05.753 --> 57:08.389
I agree with them, I'm in.

57:08.391 --> 57:10.923
All right then, we're in.

57:10.925 --> 57:13.760
Whoa, wait, we're not
even going to discuss it?

57:13.762 --> 57:18.065
Uh, I was going to say "in"
too, you just said it first.

57:18.067 --> 57:20.068
What do you say, Wilbur?

57:22.570 --> 57:24.405
Hmm, okay.

57:24.407 --> 57:26.342
Let's do it for Bigfoot.

57:43.492 --> 57:46.059
I could watch that all day.

57:46.061 --> 57:47.860
It's incredible.

57:47.862 --> 57:51.764
The structure of the hair is
different at the molecular level.

57:54.103 --> 57:56.470
Oh. Oh! It's awake.

57:56.472 --> 57:59.206
Ah, good morning, my dear beast.

57:59.208 --> 58:03.043
Or should I say... Doctor Harrison?

58:03.045 --> 58:04.978
Let me go!

58:04.980 --> 58:06.583
Ah, ah, ah. Calm down.

58:09.918 --> 58:11.452
Or not.

58:11.454 --> 58:12.689
Get back!

58:14.623 --> 58:16.789
Oh, no, no, no. There's no need for that.

58:16.791 --> 58:20.494
Do you have any idea what that thing costs?

58:20.496 --> 58:23.162
I'm sure we've got another one.

58:23.164 --> 58:26.499
Ah, the benefits of being rich.

58:26.501 --> 58:30.038
This thing here, I have no idea what it is.

58:33.108 --> 58:35.675
But we'll replace it too.

58:35.677 --> 58:39.146
The only thing of value
here is our new friend.

58:39.148 --> 58:41.347
You'll never get what you want from me.

58:41.349 --> 58:44.184
I'll fight you every step of the way.

58:44.186 --> 58:46.354
No, you won't.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.155
You want to know how I know?

58:48.157 --> 58:50.159
Your family is still out there.

58:51.226 --> 58:52.994
Leave them out of this.

58:52.996 --> 58:54.961
Happily. I have no use for them.

58:54.963 --> 58:57.331
But if you make life hard for us,

58:57.333 --> 59:00.200
we can make life very hard for them.

59:00.202 --> 59:03.604
That said, if you cooperate...

59:03.606 --> 59:06.807
I promise to take good care of your family.

59:06.809 --> 59:09.812
So, Mr. Bigfoot, what will it be?

59:16.351 --> 59:18.818
Well, guys, it looks like we're
going to have to hitch a ride.

59:18.820 --> 59:19.887
Got it.

59:22.458 --> 59:24.858
- What?
- More of a covert ride.

59:24.860 --> 59:27.662
Got it.

59:27.664 --> 59:31.231
Okay, we'll wait for the last
trailer in the convoy. Everyone ready?

59:31.233 --> 59:32.532
I was born ready.

59:32.534 --> 59:34.333
Actually, I was born a few weeks early.

59:34.335 --> 59:35.769
I needed a lot of help to get started...

59:35.771 --> 59:37.405
- Shut up.
- Will you shut up?

59:37.407 --> 59:38.704
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

59:38.706 --> 59:39.873
What?

59:39.875 --> 59:42.208
Okay, guys, it's now or never.

59:42.210 --> 59:44.110
Are you sure about this?

59:44.112 --> 59:45.213
Now.

59:48.751 --> 59:50.954
This is nuts. Whoa!

59:53.088 --> 59:54.090
Whoa!

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.398
Wait! Hold on!

01:00:03.931 --> 01:00:05.231
Wilbur! Run!

01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:06.936
What do you think I'm doing?

01:00:16.077 --> 01:00:18.077
Whoa, what was that?

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:19.345
Why you don't y'all go check it out?

01:00:19.347 --> 01:00:22.081
Aw, why do I have to
go? I'm covered in latte!

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.918
You're drinking a latte?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.422
What's wrong with that?

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.925
Fine. Let's both go.

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:34.394
Hmm.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:36.633
All right, let's roll.

01:00:43.338 --> 01:00:46.673
Hang on tight, guys. This
is going to be a long ride.

01:00:46.675 --> 01:00:49.444
Check out Steve. He's loving it.

01:00:53.815 --> 01:00:56.983
This is amazing.

01:00:58.253 --> 01:00:59.621
He probably got tired
of pecking for a living.

01:01:01.956 --> 01:01:03.990
I've extracted the bigfoot DNA

01:01:03.992 --> 01:01:05.959
and spliced it into the sequence.

01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:07.793
So what are you waiting for?

01:01:07.795 --> 01:01:10.664
This needs to be tested immediately.

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.301
Send in the intern.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:17.604
Uh, Dr. Billingsley? Hi.

01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:19.773
I... I don't mean to bother you,

01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:23.309
but I really need you
to sign my time sheet...

01:01:23.311 --> 01:01:25.278
No, not again!

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.017
Ouch! I need to really
call my academic adviser.

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.456
Hmm.

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:38.224
Oh. Oh! What's going on?

01:01:38.226 --> 01:01:41.530
My hair, it's growing.

01:01:50.038 --> 01:01:51.804
Incredible!

01:01:51.806 --> 01:01:55.008
It will be, but I'm still
fine-tuning the genetic sequence.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:58.010
We're close, but I need
more time with Bigfoot.

01:01:58.012 --> 01:02:00.179
We're closer than we've ever been.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:02.148
I want you working around the clock.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:06.221
Nobody rests and nobody goes home
until we've cracked this thing.

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.057
Sir?

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.633
Greg. Gerry. What's new with you guys?

01:02:20.635 --> 01:02:22.568
This guy drinks lattes.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:25.572
Oh, come on. You promised to let it go.

01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:27.743
Well,
lah-di-dah.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.389
Ah! Are you kidding me?

01:02:46.061 --> 01:02:49.563
How are we going to find
him? This place is gigantic!

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.800
Shh. Let me concentrate.

01:03:06.047 --> 01:03:09.215
How much time do you need
to finish sequencing his DNA?

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:10.952
The ongoing mutations are...

01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:15.856
I can't see him. We've got to get closer.

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.858
Steve, take out those security cameras.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.925
I'm on it.

01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:21.130
Everyone else, come with me.

01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:37.179
Piece of junk!

01:03:47.755 --> 01:03:49.024
Hmm.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.037
<i>Sir?</i>

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.340
Yeah, tech support? There's
something wrong with the system here.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.240
All the monitors are on the fritz.

01:04:08.242 --> 01:04:10.844
<i>Have you checked if
they are all plugged in?</i>

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:12.280
Of course they're plugged in!

01:04:13.748 --> 01:04:15.481
What do you say we smash it down?

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:17.517
Stealth all the way.

01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:21.787
Step aside, kid. Let a
professional show you how it's done.

01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:23.289
Where'd you get that mask?

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:26.358
Girl, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.298
Lick, stick, and cut.

01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:35.972
Oh, shoot.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:44.209
We've got a perimeter breach!

01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:48.081
The wrong thing to do here would
be to start pointing fingers.

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:50.684
Careful... Careful... There's
broken glass everywhere.

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.885
<i>This is standard
troubleshooting procedure.</i>

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:55.688
<i>Ninety percent of the time,
something is unplugged.</i>

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:59.592
Like I said, everything is plugged in!

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:07.833
Help! Tech support!
Get down here right now!

01:05:07.835 --> 01:05:11.273
<i>I'm so sorry, sir, I am in
India. There is nothing I can do.</i>

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:18.010
<i>Have I been helpful for you today?</i>

01:05:18.012 --> 01:05:19.915
<i>Would you be willing
to take a short survey?</i>

01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:22.717
There he is.

01:05:24.686 --> 01:05:26.485
We'll have to go through that door.

01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:27.956
Watch out, Wilbur, they're coming in!

01:05:30.525 --> 01:05:32.325
Don't worry. I got it.

01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:35.528
What are we gonna do?
How do we get out of here?

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.664
Check the lockers for anything we can use.

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.231
Take whatever you can carry.

01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:41.737
I need more men. Get them down here now!

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.940
Jackpot! Does it make me look cool?

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:50.244
Hey, no fair! I want the
flare gun! Me, me, me me, me!

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:51.579
Fine, take it.

01:05:57.719 --> 01:05:59.422
What?

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:05.825
What?

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:08.163
Maybe we should try something else.

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:11.597
Yeah, that's more like it!

01:06:12.967 --> 01:06:15.837
Ow! Watch where you're swinging that thing!

01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:19.738
On three.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.641
Okay, guys. It's now or never.

01:06:21.643 --> 01:06:22.909
Okay.

01:06:22.911 --> 01:06:24.079
One...

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:26.246
Two...

01:06:27.748 --> 01:06:28.750
Three!

01:06:32.887 --> 01:06:33.855
Fire. Fire!

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:38.527
Keep firing! Keep... Oh!

01:06:45.266 --> 01:06:46.833
Gotcha, you little weasel.

01:06:46.835 --> 01:06:49.371
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:55.876
Bring it on, suckers!

01:06:59.614 --> 01:07:00.582
Ha!

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.185
Oh...

01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:07.556
No!

01:07:08.389 --> 01:07:10.658
Get your hands off him.

01:07:17.932 --> 01:07:19.632
What now?

01:07:19.634 --> 01:07:23.304
I'll deal with them. You go
find your dad. Go, Adam, go.

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.216
Over there.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:58.707
Come on, Captain!

01:08:05.579 --> 01:08:06.581
Over there!

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.088
Huh?

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.924
Whoa, get off me.

01:08:22.197 --> 01:08:24.930
Hey, Wilbur, get me up there!

01:08:24.932 --> 01:08:27.600
My pleasure. Whoa!

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:32.974
Yee haw!

01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:43.415
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:44.618 --> 01:08:45.718
- Don't move!
- What?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.852
You're under arrest.

01:08:46.854 --> 01:08:48.656
Y'all got to read me my rights.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.160
That is one tough bear.

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.198
Oh!

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.274
Dad!

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.908
Adam, how did you get in here?

01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:13.179
Long story, but don't worry,
I am here to get you out.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.848
It's going to be okay, Adam.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.116
What are you doing?

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.451
Everything I did was to keep you safe.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:21.620
Not a day went by that I
didn't wish I was in your life.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:23.423
We've got to hurry. Come on!

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.625
I need you to believe that.

01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:27.926
You've been a naughty, naughty boy, Adam.

01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:30.630
It's very lucky your
father is a friend of mine,

01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:33.599
and friends forgive and forget.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.602
You're going to have to catch us first.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.004
Come on, Dad. Let's run!

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.504
I'm not going with you.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.272
What?

01:09:40.274 --> 01:09:44.277
I'm staying here. You and your
mother are going to be safe.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.013
It's better this way.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.479
What did you do to him?

01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:49.448
He's sick. You're killing him!

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:53.785
He's here under his own free
will. He can leave at any time.

01:09:53.787 --> 01:09:55.690
I'll be fine. Just go, Adam.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.357
Don't look so surprised,

01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:00.893
we're partners, your dad and I.

01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:03.028
- I told you we would be.
- Go on, now.

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:06.066
No! I'm not leaving without you.

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:08.168
You promised not to hurt him!

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.206
Hmm. Treat our young guest gently.

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:15.508
It's time for Daddy to get back to work.

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:16.912
Take care of your mother.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.488
Hmm.

01:10:34.328 --> 01:10:37.998
I had the most beautiful dream.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.333
I could take the rings off my tail

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:43.969
and link them together
like a fancy magician.

01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:45.705
I could be your assistant.

01:10:45.707 --> 01:10:49.375
You could saw me in
half, quarters, pennies,

01:10:49.377 --> 01:10:50.643
whatever spare change you like...

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:52.879
Whoa, how many darts did you guys have?

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:56.415
Let's just say that I was over my limit.

01:10:56.417 --> 01:10:59.585
You'll never have to
worry about anything again.

01:10:59.587 --> 01:11:03.259
Take it from me, you're
going to love being rich.

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:11.129
Oh, man, the kid sold us out.
He took the money and ran.

01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:15.035
Just think of it like he's
away on a business trip,

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:17.536
working hard to provide for you.

01:11:17.538 --> 01:11:20.305
Except he never comes home
from this business trip.

01:11:20.307 --> 01:11:24.177
Oh, your father is a busy
man. You know how it is.

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:26.745
Well, business is business, I guess.

01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:27.882
That a boy.

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:29.549
Huh?

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:32.018
Stop him! Get the boy.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.223
Business is business!

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:39.427
Huh?

01:11:41.529 --> 01:11:45.130
- Don't let it get wet!
- My beautiful hair!

01:11:45.132 --> 01:11:47.032
Ah! My toupee!

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:57.643
Security! Security! Shut down the fire
alarm in sector 4 and open the doors!

01:11:57.645 --> 01:12:02.115
<i>Security, shut down the
fire alarm in sector 4.</i>

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.282
What?

01:12:03.284 --> 01:12:05.220
A... A fire? Oh, no.

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:12.925
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

01:12:12.927 --> 01:12:16.294
<i>Please proceed to your nearest
exit in an orderly manner.</i>

01:12:16.296 --> 01:12:18.598
What's wrong with that guy?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.869
Security, security. Switch
off the alarm right away!

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.970
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:30.143
Stop it, stop it, this is a false alarm.

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.945
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.613
<i>Please exit the facility at once.</i>

01:12:34.615 --> 01:12:36.016
What are you doing?

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.116
Standard procedure, sir.

01:12:37.118 --> 01:12:39.488
Let me... Argh! ...go!

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.961
Oh, look who's back.
Mister sellout moneybags.

01:12:48.963 --> 01:12:50.929
Did you really think I'd leave you here?

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.098
Hmm.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.634
Get these cages open now. Everybody out.

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.802
Yeah.

01:12:56.804 --> 01:12:58.841
Feel free to start with me.

01:13:04.078 --> 01:13:06.713
I can't believe you're unlocking
all these randoms before me!

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.348
Thank you, my dear.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.084
Mmm. Hello there, cowboy.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.087
What are you in for?

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:13.721
Murder.

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:16.923
Just joking. I eat carrots.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.027
You're funny.

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:24.363
Tina! Get me out of here!

01:13:24.365 --> 01:13:27.235
This is not the time for
fraternizing with inmates!

01:13:29.637 --> 01:13:30.969
Adam, what are you doing?

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.005
Come on, Dad, I'm breaking you out.

01:13:33.007 --> 01:13:37.977
I told you, I can't go. They'll always
be after me. We'll always be hiding.

01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:40.179
I don't care, as long as we're together.

01:13:40.181 --> 01:13:44.683
No, I won't do that to
you. I'm not leaving.

01:13:44.685 --> 01:13:48.187
If you don't come with me, I'll
tell them I'm a bigfoot too.

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:50.190
You can't.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:53.159
I've got your genes, I've got your crazy
hair. I've got everything they need.

01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:54.226
Adam, no.

01:13:54.228 --> 01:13:56.762
Either we both stay, or we both go.

01:13:56.764 --> 01:13:58.498
It's up to you.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.770
But I need my dad, and I'm
not leaving here without you.

01:14:05.105 --> 01:14:07.742
You are one stubborn kid.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.514
I guess I take after my old man.

01:14:16.484 --> 01:14:19.652
Where's Adam? You said
he was right behind us.

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:21.987
What have you done with my son?

01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:24.089
Calm down, he's on the way.

01:14:24.091 --> 01:14:25.659
As soon as he gets home,
we'll be out of your hair.

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:28.460
As soon as you leave, I'm calling the cops.

01:14:28.462 --> 01:14:30.763
What are you gonna say?

01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:33.199
"Hello, police? My husband is Bigfoot,

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:35.268
"and he's been captured
in an evil conspiracy."

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.536
Sounds pretty crazy to me.

01:14:37.538 --> 01:14:39.805
You know, someone with a story like that

01:14:39.807 --> 01:14:41.941
probably isn't fit to raise a kid.

01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:44.710
How dare you. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

01:14:44.712 --> 01:14:47.379
Listen, lady, we're just doing our jobs.

01:14:48.815 --> 01:14:51.718
Now where's the can? You
got a bathroom in this place?

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.122
No, we go in the bushes outside.

01:14:55.289 --> 01:14:56.792
It's upstairs.

01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:06.633
Simpson! Come into the bathroom, right now!

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:10.335
Uh... That's okay, I'll
wait until you're done.

01:15:10.337 --> 01:15:12.039
Would you get in here?

01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:16.010
What's going on?

01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:21.280
Sir, we're at the house.

01:15:21.282 --> 01:15:23.848
The boy's a bigfoot. We've
got the hair to prove it.

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:27.019
<i>What? Fantastic!
Change of plan, then.</i>

01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:28.689
Roger that.

01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:42.835
That's not very nice. Do you
treat all your guests like this?

01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:45.271
Just the ones that kidnap my son.

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:53.111
<i>Evacuate, evacuate.</i>

01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:55.648
<i>Time to get your butts in gear.</i>

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.183
<i>Evacuate! Evacuate!</i>

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:04.025
Follow me, buddy.

01:16:07.528 --> 01:16:11.400
No more hiding. We're shutting
this place down for good.

01:16:30.518 --> 01:16:33.087
Oh, no! Come on. Hurry!

01:16:38.926 --> 01:16:41.059
What now?

01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:43.162
There's got to be another way out.

01:16:43.164 --> 01:16:44.131
Dad, up there.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.868
Let's check it out... Follow me.

01:16:53.207 --> 01:16:57.410
Adam, watch where you step. Stay close.

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.780
Keep on going, I'm right behind you.

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:09.791
Up there.

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.634
There's no way down. We're trapped.

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:22.804
No, Dad. Look.

01:17:25.306 --> 01:17:26.307
- Zipline!
- Zipline!

01:17:33.247 --> 01:17:34.513
Aah!

01:17:34.515 --> 01:17:35.516
Oh, shoot.

01:17:40.154 --> 01:17:43.125
One way in, one way out.

01:17:45.192 --> 01:17:46.194
We're going home.

01:17:49.195 --> 01:17:52.033
Let me go, you big oaf.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.535
So what'll it be?

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:59.371
Shall we end this little charade
and return you to your cell?

01:17:59.373 --> 01:18:01.273
He's never going back there.

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:03.412
Dad!

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:10.250
You silly beast. You lied to me.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:14.687
You're not so special. The
boy has everything we need.

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:17.589
No, please. Leave him alone. You promised.

01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:18.794
It's too late now.

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:33.805
I would've kept you
both, but I only need one.

01:18:33.807 --> 01:18:35.077
No, please!

01:18:36.143 --> 01:18:37.145
I'm sorry, son.

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.981
No!

01:18:45.653 --> 01:18:47.186
No.

01:18:47.188 --> 01:18:48.888
Argh! You animal!

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.827
Really, it's you who is the animal.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.196
I hate to break it to you,

01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:59.365
but that's only a flare gun.

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:02.468
It won't do you any
good. Now get back inside,

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:03.869
we've got work to do.

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:06.507
No, you're out of business.

01:19:24.057 --> 01:19:25.292
No!

01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:54.990
Don't just stand there, pull me up!

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.626
No!

01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:05.099
Ooh, that must hurt.

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:11.605
Dad!

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.507
Dad!

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.077
Oh, oh...

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.251
Please, don't leave me.

01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:33.828
<i>The healing touch, it all
goes with the territory.</i>

01:20:59.252 --> 01:21:03.088
Look at that! He really is a bigfoot.

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:05.958
You see, you never listen
to me. I told you so!

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.759
Are you kidding?

01:21:29.817 --> 01:21:30.784
Adam?

01:21:31.819 --> 01:21:32.787
Dad?

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.393
For the better or for the worse,

01:21:41.395 --> 01:21:43.396
it looks like you're stuck with me now.

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:46.366
You know, Dad, I'm glad to be a bigfoot.

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.166
Me too.

01:21:48.168 --> 01:21:51.169
I don't know how you did
it, but that was amazing!

01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:54.874
I got to say it, kid, you're the real deal!

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.576
I guess I am. Whoa, watch out guys!

01:21:57.578 --> 01:22:02.916
You... You should have kept
your end of the bargain.

01:22:03.851 --> 01:22:06.787
It did not have to end this way.

01:22:12.926 --> 01:22:14.996
Nobody messes with my family.

01:22:16.096 --> 01:22:18.030
Huh, my kinda woman.

01:22:18.032 --> 01:22:20.066
- Mom.
- Honey.

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:25.670
Hi, sweetheart. It's great to see you.

01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:28.005
- No more hiding.
- No more hiding.

01:22:28.007 --> 01:22:29.476
Look what I found.

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:39.753
Yo, dudes, metal! Tada
da da da da da, yeah!

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.195
My research.

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.664
My lab!

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:56.638
My time sheet.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:12.585
Ah, ah. Hey! That hurts.

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.656
Don't you have a snooze button?

01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:18.960
You're gonna be late
for school. Now get up!

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.767
Yeah!

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:30.505
Good mornin'! Allow me.

01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:34.042
Oops. Sorry.

01:23:35.943 --> 01:23:37.375
Good to go.

01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:38.912
Ew, gross.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:42.851
Mmm.

01:23:48.789 --> 01:23:50.990
How about a bearskin rug!

01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:55.764
Mmm, he's so soft.

01:24:04.171 --> 01:24:05.638
Hello, everyone.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.141
Whoa, Trapper, that's
going to give me nightmares!

01:24:09.143 --> 01:24:11.410
Girls, don't listen to Uncle Adam,

01:24:11.412 --> 01:24:15.848
he's just jealous of how pretty you
made me look. Now who's doing my nails?

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:18.650
And you thought you
were going to have boys.

01:24:18.652 --> 01:24:20.352
I never said that.

01:24:20.354 --> 01:24:22.690
That raccoon will never change.

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:26.791
I could get used to this.

01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:29.495
I could definitely get used to this.

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:34.569
Well, get used to it. We've got a
lot of breakfasts to make up for.

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.001
Ooh, gotta go.

01:24:37.003 --> 01:24:38.536
See you guys tonight.

01:24:38.538 --> 01:24:39.740
Don't forget your lunch.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:43.174
Let me guess, meatloaf?

01:24:43.176 --> 01:24:44.710
But of course.

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:47.847
New house rule. From now
on, Dad does all the cooking.

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:49.682
You got a deal.

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:53.088
I, uh... I'm not so sure...

01:24:58.725 --> 01:25:02.760
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

01:25:02.762 --> 01:25:05.697
Hey, Tony, what are you
doing here all by yourself?

01:25:05.699 --> 01:25:06.898
Where are your bros?

01:25:09.869 --> 01:25:13.371
Calling in the cavalry. I
guess some things never change.

01:25:13.373 --> 01:25:15.206
Where have you been, mop-top?

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.876
You know what? I like my hair.

01:25:17.878 --> 01:25:19.844
Good for you.

01:25:19.846 --> 01:25:21.679
I'm serious, leave me alone.

01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:24.152
We don't need to fight.
You're better than this.

01:25:25.552 --> 01:25:27.818
No, we're not.

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.589
Okay, you asked for it.

01:25:32.024 --> 01:25:34.593
What are you're going to
do, whistle us to death?

01:25:34.595 --> 01:25:36.798
Just calling in the troops.

01:25:38.564 --> 01:25:42.000
Remember, I gave you a chance to walk away.

01:25:42.002 --> 01:25:43.335
Oh.

01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:46.640
Look what we have here. We're terrified!

01:25:57.016 --> 01:25:58.282
Thanks, Wilbur.

01:25:58.284 --> 01:26:00.018
Just doing my part.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.321
Girls, Daddy is very proud of you.

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:04.958
What are you smiling about?

01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:10.198
No. You didn't. Let's check them out.

01:26:27.247 --> 01:26:29.315
Whoa. Don't mess with these girls.

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:32.151
They take after their old man.

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:34.119
Now you better get back inside

01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:37.488
before somebody reports a giant
bear terrorizing kids in the city.

01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:38.493
Hi, Adam.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.427
Hi, there.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.861
What was that all about?

01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:44.964
Well, uh...

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.132
Do you want to walk to school with me?

01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:48.401
I'll tell you on the way.

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:51.239
I'd love to. I thought you'd never ask.

01:26:52.305 --> 01:26:54.205
Oh. Cool.

01:26:55.809 --> 01:26:57.108
Oh, no, not again.

01:26:57.110 --> 01:27:00.144
Whoa, what's with the feet?

01:27:00.146 --> 01:27:03.482
You're really different. I like that.

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:06.588
Maybe it'd be better
if I switch to sandals.

01:27:07.988 --> 01:27:09.787
We better hurry, we're going to be late.

01:27:09.789 --> 01:27:13.025
Slow down, we've got plenty of time.

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:15.027
I really do want to hear your story.

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:17.765
Well, where do I start?

01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:27.071
