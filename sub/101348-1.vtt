WEBVTT

00:43.791 --> 00:45.166
Are you hungry?

00:45.833 --> 00:48.750
Your father will be home shortly.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.791
I'll change my clothes, then keep
me company in the kitchen.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.083
-Good morning.
-Water...

01:22.083 --> 01:23.708
Water.

01:23.791 --> 01:26.041
-Mom!
-I'll be out in a minute.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.833
Be quiet and don't move!

01:49.250 --> 01:51.625
-Ma...
-I told you to shut up.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.250
Please don't hurt us.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.875
Isabel!

02:10.875 --> 02:12.166
Zeca!

02:13.458 --> 02:14.666
Help me!

02:39.000 --> 02:42.916
Please God, help us.

02:46.416 --> 02:50.791
Mrs. Santana, you're fully dilated.
We have to deliver the baby.

03:14.750 --> 03:19.375
We have to deliver the baby... push!
You're going to give birth now, push!

03:22.125 --> 03:26.375
Mama, it's okay.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.833
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, General.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.833
Is my brother inside?
Open the gate, please.

04:41.916 --> 04:44.958
Yes, sir, but the commander
asked not to be disturbed.

04:45.041 --> 04:48.708
You have ten seconds to open the gate
before this gets ugly, understand?!

04:50.666 --> 04:52.333
I'm sorry, General.

05:54.958 --> 05:56.375
Dias.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.541
Take him out of here.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.416
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BROTHER!

10:05.166 --> 10:11.458
<i>Dias, where are you? We have</i>
<i>a location, we're ready to move in.</i>

10:12.250 --> 10:15.166
<i>You're needed here. Call me.</i>

10:21.833 --> 10:27.750
Matias, I see you and Dias as my sons

10:27.833 --> 10:31.333
because I was very good friends
with your father.

10:31.416 --> 10:35.500
But... as commander of the police...

10:36.041 --> 10:41.875
it's my duty to act and say your brother's
recent behavior is unacceptable.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.666
I'm disappointed. Has he lost his mind?

10:46.291 --> 10:51.208
Dias' heavy drinking, not reporting in
for days, relaxing at home,

10:51.291 --> 10:53.541
not getting his ass to work.

10:53.625 --> 10:57.833
All our attempts to help him
and it seems our efforts have no results.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.458
But... this can't carry on...

11:01.541 --> 11:04.375
not on my watch.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.458
I understand, Commander,
and I apologize on his behalf.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.583
The anniversary of my parents' murder
is the same day my brother was born.

11:18.666 --> 11:21.708
Birthdays are never easy for him.

11:21.791 --> 11:23.541
But there is no excuse.

11:23.625 --> 11:27.833
I was going to give you one
month's leave as requested.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.541
I have given this a lot of thought.

11:30.625 --> 11:35.833
I'm assigning you as the DNIC Commander.

11:35.916 --> 11:38.333
So you can keep him an eye on him.

11:38.416 --> 11:42.875
You will be my eyes and ears
on this operation.

11:43.833 --> 11:50.750
You and your brother will get this done.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.750
Understood?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.125
Get out.

12:23.541 --> 12:25.791
Hey, Commander Dias Santana is here.

12:25.875 --> 12:31.291
About time. Less we have to deal with
that nappy wearin' lieutenant the better.

12:33.125 --> 12:36.375
I don't think that guy's ever
fired a shot in his life.

12:36.458 --> 12:39.125
The only shots he fires...

12:39.208 --> 12:41.125
are at his wife's ass.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.666
Hey, have some respect.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.375
What's up, boys? What are we
talking about, football again?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.291
Sergeant Marco.

12:54.833 --> 12:58.500
Might want to pull that tongue back in
your mouth, rookie. Might swallow a fly.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.875
No, I was just... staring.

13:01.958 --> 13:06.708
I know you all missed me, so save
your niceties for someone who needs it.

13:06.791 --> 13:12.458
I hope your minds are still fixed on
our mission, because it's happening.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.708
Sergeant Qeto, the details.

13:15.791 --> 13:19.083
-Good morning, men.
-Good morning, Sergeant.

13:20.541 --> 13:26.291
Okay, our mission today
is this warehouse in Mutamba.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.500
We have information that
this complex houses

13:29.583 --> 13:33.833
one of the biggest drug operations
in the city

13:33.916 --> 13:36.500
I'm going to pass this over
to Agent Orlando

13:36.583 --> 13:40.166
who worked with Sinse Investigations.

14:11.958 --> 14:15.041
Obi Chukwu... Nigerian.
He's the ringleader's right hand.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.541
And the big boss?

14:16.625 --> 14:20.375
We don't know his name or who he is.
We are calling him Mr. X for now.

14:20.458 --> 14:24.041
Maybe his mama never gave him one.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.333
Okay, settle down.

14:29.208 --> 14:34.291
General Matias will be leading
the operation with Commander Dias.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.666
-You got that?
-Yes, sir!

14:37.708 --> 14:38.750
Commander...

14:40.166 --> 14:43.041
I'd like to be on this mission.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.416
Alright, but don't screw up.

18:04.791 --> 18:07.625
Listen up, Mr. X is most likely here.

18:07.708 --> 18:09.625
No description...

18:10.250 --> 18:11.708
but...

18:11.791 --> 18:15.166
we have Mac 10s, AK47s.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.958
Bring the heavy fire power
and let's be smooth about it.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.541
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

18:23.958 --> 18:27.000
I want to thank you for what you did
back at your house with the chief...

18:27.083 --> 18:30.208
and the motorcycle...
but I can take it from here.

18:31.375 --> 18:38.375
I don't need your brotherly concern
or help.

18:39.958 --> 18:42.750
Four years and nothing has changed.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.375
Commander, as your superior

18:47.458 --> 18:51.958
I suggest you get with the program
if you want to stay a cop.

18:54.291 --> 18:58.541
Okay, guys, let's lock and load.

19:24.166 --> 19:28.000
General, with your permission, we've got
garbage out back that needs removing.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.291
<i>Already on it.</i>

19:34.000 --> 19:37.125
<i>Marco, De Costa. Greenlight, entrance.</i>

19:37.208 --> 19:43.083
Sir, already got them in our cross hairs.
Injured, or in a body bag?

19:43.166 --> 19:47.250
Gentleman, people are going to die here
today, and it's not going to be one of us.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.208
Bag them.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.541
Shit... Got one heading your way.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.125
Reis, deal with that.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.375
Okay, perimeter secure.
Breach, breach, breach!

21:26.583 --> 21:29.916
Hey, Ze Maria, don't get cocky about it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.583
You want to radio him something better?
It worked, okay.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.458
I hope so, let's move.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.083
Deal with this.

22:36.625 --> 22:37.958
And shut the fuck up!

23:09.291 --> 23:10.541
Cover me!

23:30.666 --> 23:31.833
You'll live.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.125
You've got friendlies down here!

24:17.208 --> 24:19.875
General Matias, we have a runner
heading out of the east wing,

24:19.958 --> 24:22.583
and he's carrying a briefcase.
Could be our boy.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.666
-<i>Have you got a shot?</i>
-No.

24:36.791 --> 24:38.208
Have you got him?

24:39.458 --> 24:40.375
Negative.

24:44.291 --> 24:45.458
Throw it down.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.625
Go ahead.

28:16.708 --> 28:17.916
Run, asshole.

29:14.541 --> 29:16.166
You've got fifteen minutes.

29:16.958 --> 29:20.041
Sweet talk him, lie to him, I don't care.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.333
Just get the name of his boss.

29:22.416 --> 29:26.250
You want to be a field agent?
Here's your shot.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.125
-What the hell is this?
-Change of tactics.

29:29.833 --> 29:34.625
If I go in I'm just going to kick his ass,
so let the kid have a crack at it.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.666
Perp's in there.

29:39.666 --> 29:42.166
I hope you know what you're doing.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.833
You're lucky I don't beat your ass.

31:08.958 --> 31:12.416
He should have killed me
in my mother's womb.

31:35.833 --> 31:38.291
On the count of ten.

31:38.916 --> 31:41.500
Shoot this asshole.

31:52.208 --> 31:59.208
Ten... nine... eight... seven... six...

32:01.250 --> 32:04.416
Five... four... three... talk...

33:28.333 --> 33:30.875
We're going to get him.

33:32.541 --> 33:33.833
I promise.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.375
-<i>Yeah?</i>
-How you doing?

34:13.458 --> 34:14.916
I'm alright.

34:15.916 --> 34:18.458
<i>We're all getting together, remember?</i>

34:20.333 --> 34:23.041
Not really interested in a noisy club.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.875
We have a meeting with
the NP Commander tomorrow.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.583
We'll get Ferreira.

34:31.708 --> 34:36.750
You should come tonight. It'll be good.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.875
<i>Dias...</i>

34:39.958 --> 34:46.750
<i>I don't know what happened between us,</i>
<i>but maybe it's happening for a reason.</i>

34:50.833 --> 34:54.750
Okay, if you don't come for me,
do it for your men.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.791
Anything else?

34:58.833 --> 35:00.208
No.

35:54.583 --> 35:57.625
Glad you made it. Happy birthday.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.541
Happy birthday!

36:01.291 --> 36:03.125
Happy days.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.250
Cheers!

36:11.208 --> 36:13.208
To a happy birthday!

36:13.291 --> 36:14.875
Turn down the music!

36:14.958 --> 36:18.041
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

36:18.125 --> 36:21.875
Today is my brother's birthday,
well, not today, a few days ago.

36:21.958 --> 36:27.541
So today I want to wish him
a happy birthday with a special song by...

36:29.416 --> 36:31.541
Marco and Ze Maria.

37:17.958 --> 37:21.250
-Happy birthday, brother.
-Yeah, thanks.

37:22.416 --> 37:25.625
Now enjoy your ass
and let me get this place jumping!

38:30.250 --> 38:32.916
Excuse me... dance?

38:35.916 --> 38:37.416
Not tonight.

40:33.416 --> 40:36.500
General Matias,
your appointment has arrived.

40:36.583 --> 40:41.458
Appointment? Damn, I need to
get to DNIC this morning. Remind me?

40:41.541 --> 40:44.000
Zentex from South Africa,
the expiring arms contracts.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.000
Right, send them in.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.250
General Santana.

41:01.583 --> 41:04.375
-Good morning.
-Morning.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.291
You enjoy your birthday?

41:11.666 --> 41:15.958
I don't really do birthdays,
but yes, it was a good gesture.

41:20.041 --> 41:21.791
So, what do you do?

41:29.625 --> 41:33.000
I'm a cleaner, I clean
the rubbish from the street.

41:33.083 --> 41:39.125
You're getting ready to leave.
Okay, will I see you again?

41:40.833 --> 41:42.041
No.

41:43.166 --> 41:44.625
I'm sorry.

41:46.125 --> 41:48.666
I shouldn't have done this.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.041
I have to go.

42:52.291 --> 42:55.750
What bullshit! Do they actually want
to clean up the crime

42:55.833 --> 42:58.416
or do they just want to talk about it?

42:58.500 --> 43:00.750
Because that sounded like
a lot of talk and no action.

43:00.833 --> 43:04.583
How are we going to get Ferreira in South
Africa if we can't go to South Africa?

43:04.666 --> 43:07.958
I don't know what just happened.
I'll find out.

43:08.041 --> 43:11.791
This was supposed to be a strategy
meeting to bring Ferreira back.

43:12.458 --> 43:14.666
Then someone got to them.

43:14.750 --> 43:21.750
And what does that tell you about them,
the ones you want to be like?

43:22.791 --> 43:28.250
I'm done. From now on,
I'll do things my own way if I have to.

46:13.291 --> 46:16.791
-Sorry about the other night.
-Sorry for what?

46:19.208 --> 46:23.375
Unless you're here to arrest me,
or need me professionally, Commander...

46:24.041 --> 46:26.333
I'm going for a swim.

46:53.458 --> 46:57.083
You know I'm afraid of the ocean,
ever since I was a boy.

46:57.166 --> 47:01.291
And here you are in the middle of
the ocean. Should I be impressed?

47:01.375 --> 47:02.291
Are you?

47:04.916 --> 47:07.875
I'm hanging out with some of
the boys in The Borough tonight.

47:07.958 --> 47:13.333
That's our spot. You should
come down and join us.

47:13.958 --> 47:17.000
-Pretty please, sir?
-Maybe.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.000
Maybe?

47:20.458 --> 47:21.750
Okay.

48:31.791 --> 48:34.458
Fuck it, why not?

49:00.500 --> 49:02.166
Evening, gents.

49:02.250 --> 49:03.500
Relax.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.958
Cold beer, please.

49:16.916 --> 49:21.000
Good to see you're out,
any word on Ferreira?

49:21.875 --> 49:28.000
I know where he lives, he's not
exactly keeping a low profile.

49:28.791 --> 49:32.125
I also found out about the tragedy
he brought to your family.

49:32.208 --> 49:34.875
No need to get into that.

49:35.750 --> 49:39.833
-Keep me informed.
-I will.

49:39.916 --> 49:43.666
-Have fun tonight, okay? That's an order.
-Okay.

50:49.125 --> 50:51.875
Is this how you live a little?

50:52.416 --> 50:54.166
Sitting alone?

50:55.250 --> 50:59.416
-I'm not good with people.
-At least that was honest.

51:03.708 --> 51:07.291
If you go after Ferreira in South Africa,
I'd like to be in on it.

51:09.416 --> 51:13.083
Orlando's not the only one
who knows how to get information.

51:15.708 --> 51:18.958
I'm sorry about your mother and father.

51:19.041 --> 51:21.541
It's not hard to figure out
you're going after him.

51:22.666 --> 51:24.833
I could be an asset.

51:24.916 --> 51:30.083
A man and woman traveling together
as a couple attracts less attention.

51:31.666 --> 51:33.416
Think about it.

52:05.833 --> 52:07.916
I'll see you all Monday.

52:11.958 --> 52:15.166
If you find anything else, let me know.

52:16.541 --> 52:18.375
Alright, take care.

1:00:03.916 --> 1:00:07.375
Second lesson, shut up and shoot.

1:00:07.458 --> 1:00:10.250
-Are you alone?
-Give me a gun.

1:01:27.041 --> 1:01:30.500
-What are you two doing here?
-We need to talk, minister.

1:01:30.583 --> 1:01:32.041
Right now.

1:01:35.791 --> 1:01:39.041
He's the main guy, the head of it all.

1:01:39.875 --> 1:01:44.333
Cut off the head and we stop
the biggest drug operation

1:01:44.416 --> 1:01:46.958
in Angola and Central Africa.

1:01:47.041 --> 1:01:50.083
And the murders that go with it.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:54.125
He killed three of my men tonight,
men with families.

1:01:54.208 --> 1:01:58.875
And three of mine. They spoke English,
they're not even from here.

1:01:58.958 --> 1:02:01.375
We know where he is in South Africa.

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:04.541
Send the two of us, and a small
group of agents under cover.

1:02:05.166 --> 1:02:08.833
Ask the Deputy Minister and
Commissioner Martins to come in.

1:02:10.166 --> 1:02:13.583
As much as I would like to think so,
I'm not the only voice here.

1:02:14.250 --> 1:02:19.666
What you're asking can only be done if he
can be captured or eliminated discreetly.

1:02:21.750 --> 1:02:28.666
I can't allow the two of you to cause
problems between South Africa and Angola.

1:02:30.916 --> 1:02:33.041
You are my best men...

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:37.958
but the country comes first.

1:02:44.875 --> 1:02:46.291
Gentlemen...

1:02:46.375 --> 1:02:52.250
We have a sensitive issue, which I know
I can rely upon you to assist with.

1:02:52.333 --> 1:02:55.083
We need diplomatic visas to South Africa.

1:02:55.791 --> 1:02:59.708
And I assume untraceable weapons?

1:03:00.666 --> 1:03:03.083
Sir, do you know what you're asking?

1:03:03.166 --> 1:03:05.625
Yes, I do. I'm doing it for
the defense of this country.

1:03:05.708 --> 1:03:08.416
Consider it done. Shouldn't be a problem.

1:03:12.750 --> 1:03:17.166
I don't need to tell you
not to speak to anyone.

1:03:18.708 --> 1:03:20.833
Unfortunately, confidential information
in the NP

1:03:20.916 --> 1:03:24.125
seems to get bought and sold like milk.

1:03:24.208 --> 1:03:26.000
They definitely have someone
on the inside.

1:03:26.083 --> 1:03:28.083
We can't trust anyone.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:32.375
I assume my actions have met
with your satisfaction?

1:03:33.041 --> 1:03:34.375
Yes, sir.

1:06:22.875 --> 1:06:24.708
Yeah, walk away, asshole,

1:06:24.791 --> 1:06:29.125
go stick your fucking head in a hole
and maybe it'll all go away.

1:06:29.208 --> 1:06:31.208
God damn it!

1:06:31.291 --> 1:06:34.666
Are you insane, he's from
the president's office.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:36.166
So what?

1:06:37.375 --> 1:06:39.166
Let him fire me.

1:06:39.250 --> 1:06:43.791
Hell, I'll hand in my resignation
if this is the best we can do.

1:06:43.875 --> 1:06:46.375
-I'm sorry, General.

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:56.625
You owe it to her. Tell her we don't
actually arrest criminals in Africa.

1:07:15.125 --> 1:07:16.916
Do you want to spend the rest of
your life, you and Thandi,

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:18.708
looking over your shoulders?

1:07:18.791 --> 1:07:23.416
Because he's not going to stop until
we're all dead. You know that, Matias.

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:25.500
Wake up, Matias.

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:30.375
You're living in a fucking fairytale if
you think the law is going to protect us.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.750
Evening, gentlemen. I know
I'm the last person you wanted to see.

1:11:54.833 --> 1:11:57.166
I know you don't have much time.

1:11:58.333 --> 1:12:00.250
I'm not here to stop you.

1:12:00.333 --> 1:12:04.333
The man you're after is hosting
a party tomorrow night.

1:12:05.458 --> 1:12:08.000
Apparently intended to celebrate...

1:12:09.083 --> 1:12:11.041
your demise.

1:12:14.375 --> 1:12:16.833
I hear you've been put on
the invitation list.

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:19.666
The Angolan government

1:12:19.750 --> 1:12:24.166
will denounce any non-sanctioned actions.

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:28.583
You're on your own.

1:12:33.666 --> 1:12:37.083
-So we get this guy, right?
-Yeah, we get him.

1:12:37.791 --> 1:12:39.708
And we get our lives back.

1:12:40.666 --> 1:12:43.458
You alright? What's the matter?

1:12:47.291 --> 1:12:48.750
I'll be fine.

1:17:01.958 --> 1:17:03.333
Good luck.

1:17:05.791 --> 1:17:09.750
We take Ferreira dead or alive.
Any objections?

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:11.458
Alive if possible.

1:17:11.541 --> 1:17:16.375
How likely is that with an army
of gangsters around him?

1:17:16.458 --> 1:17:18.708
If capturing him is on the agenda,
then yes...

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:23.375
we'll kill him if we have to,
but we're not here as assassins.

1:17:24.541 --> 1:17:26.208
Are you okay?

1:17:30.166 --> 1:17:32.875
Yeah, just... just tired, I guess.

1:17:34.666 --> 1:17:36.833
I'm going to get some air.

1:17:38.208 --> 1:17:40.083
I'll keep an eye on him.

1:18:31.291 --> 1:18:33.458
He started shouting, then passed out.

1:18:34.666 --> 1:18:36.875
That's it, we need to abort.

1:18:40.708 --> 1:18:43.083
It's black magic.

1:18:43.166 --> 1:18:45.083
Dias, what are you talking about?

1:18:48.750 --> 1:18:50.375
Black magic...

1:18:56.583 --> 1:18:58.666
You can't tell me what to do.

1:18:59.458 --> 1:19:02.291
You lost that right a long time ago.

1:19:02.375 --> 1:19:05.291
I knew this would happen, you'd blame me.

1:19:05.375 --> 1:19:08.000
I was six years old, goddamn it!

1:19:08.583 --> 1:19:10.708
I blame you for a lot of things...

1:19:10.791 --> 1:19:15.208
your rich family in Cunene, while I went
from one shitty orphanage to the next.

1:19:15.291 --> 1:19:17.458
Even when you came back to Luanda,
where were you?

1:19:17.541 --> 1:19:21.000
I lived on the streets
and had to fight to survive.

1:19:21.083 --> 1:19:23.333
Yeah, I got into trouble
with the people I ran with,

1:19:23.416 --> 1:19:27.125
but they were more family to me
than you ever were.

1:19:27.208 --> 1:19:31.958
I kept coming back for you,
but you were always so difficult.

1:19:32.041 --> 1:19:35.625
And that family took care of me
like I was their own.

1:19:35.708 --> 1:19:38.625
You never wanted to listen,
you still don't listen.

1:19:38.708 --> 1:19:41.333
You're stuck in the past
where you've always been.

1:19:41.416 --> 1:19:44.083
You might as well have been buried
with your parents.

1:19:44.166 --> 1:19:47.875
At least you'd feel right at home.
You hear, you idiot!

1:19:47.958 --> 1:19:50.500
You arrogant son of a bitch!

1:20:14.583 --> 1:20:17.375
Landlord's not going to like that.

1:20:25.791 --> 1:20:28.083
I didn't know you felt like that, brother.

1:20:28.166 --> 1:20:29.250
It doesn't matter.

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:33.250
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

1:21:48.416 --> 1:21:49.583
Let's split up.

1:21:49.666 --> 1:21:50.958
Thandi.

1:21:59.208 --> 1:22:01.000
Orlando, where are you?

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:04.000
<i>I'm out back, on my way.</i>

1:22:40.125 --> 1:22:43.500
Orlando, we need to hurry this up,
Ferreira may be arriving any moment now.

1:22:43.583 --> 1:22:44.833
<i>I'm coming...</i>

1:22:45.791 --> 1:22:47.250
<i>Nearly there.</i>

1:23:00.875 --> 1:23:04.416
<i>Matias, we're coming out,</i>
<i>Orlando has your weapon.</i>

1:23:16.875 --> 1:23:20.083
I'll cover the entrance.
You get to the main floor.

1:25:19.208 --> 1:25:23.041
-I have eyes on Ferreira.
-<i>Do you have a clear shot at him?</i>

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:25.458
There's too many people.

1:25:27.791 --> 1:25:30.458
<i>If he comes this way he's mine.</i>

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.208
Orlando, blend in.

1:25:35.333 --> 1:25:37.041
Oh, yes, sir.

1:25:56.791 --> 1:26:01.750
We've been found out. Time for plan B,
things just got crazy out here.

1:26:01.833 --> 1:26:05.125
<i>Orlando, get us a ride out of here.</i>

1:26:23.375 --> 1:26:26.083
-I've got wheels.
-Hold tight.

1:26:38.625 --> 1:26:40.291
We have to get out of here.

1:26:40.375 --> 1:26:44.791
Get to Orlando. Set up to give us cover,
we're going to need it.

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:47.625
Watch your back.

1:27:36.291 --> 1:27:37.291
Where's Celia?

1:27:37.375 --> 1:27:39.458
I sent her to the car,
she should have passed you.

1:27:39.541 --> 1:27:42.125
We have to abort,
and she didn't pass here.

1:27:42.208 --> 1:27:47.583
I can't leave her here. You go.
I'll finish this myself. I'll find her...

1:27:47.666 --> 1:27:48.875
and get Ferreira.

1:28:23.833 --> 1:28:27.000
Orlando, any word on Celia?

1:28:40.750 --> 1:28:43.250
Matias, you go, I'll handle this.

1:29:03.416 --> 1:29:05.041
You should have gone.

1:29:22.208 --> 1:29:25.750
Orlando, get out of here.
Get to Thandi and go.

1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:51.333
Where are we?

1:29:55.375 --> 1:29:57.000
I'll tell you...

1:29:57.958 --> 1:29:59.541
when I find out.

1:30:01.208 --> 1:30:03.208
Hold on, brother. Hold on.

1:30:04.083 --> 1:30:07.208
Where's Celia?

1:30:08.208 --> 1:30:09.500
Celia...

1:30:11.791 --> 1:30:15.166
I don't know.
We have to find a way out of here.

1:31:57.708 --> 1:31:58.958
Celia...

1:32:10.541 --> 1:32:11.791
You bitch!

1:32:16.541 --> 1:32:19.166
Why did you do this, money?

1:36:01.291 --> 1:36:02.250
Dias.

1:36:04.458 --> 1:36:05.708
Dias, wake up, brother.

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:08.833
Dias...

1:36:51.750 --> 1:36:53.416
Dias...

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.791
Dias...

1:36:56.875 --> 1:36:58.083
Dias...

1:38:28.708 --> 1:38:31.541
Take care of my brother,
get him to the hospital.

1:38:33.083 --> 1:38:36.666
I'll get Ferreira and Celia,
she's the mole. Give me the car keys.

1:38:36.750 --> 1:38:38.208
Celia?

1:38:38.291 --> 1:38:40.750
Damn, she was so hot.

1:38:41.416 --> 1:38:43.708
No hospital. Don't lose sight of Dias.

1:39:07.833 --> 1:39:09.541
Orlando, stop here.

1:39:16.375 --> 1:39:17.916
Get Dias.

1:40:45.416 --> 1:40:48.166
I should shoot you dead, here and now...

1:40:48.250 --> 1:40:53.166
but I'm not you. You're just going
to have to rot in prison.

1:42:23.458 --> 1:42:24.625
Dias.

1:43:36.166 --> 1:43:37.875
You okay?
