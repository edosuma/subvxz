00:02.402 --> 00:04.103
[Winter]
I remember once before,

00:04.105 --> 00:07.573
you did propose to me,
you asked me to marry you.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.242
I don't remember
proposing to you before.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.847
[Chantel] I know that
you didn't have a relationship

00:14.849 --> 00:18.417
with your dad since you were
about, what, 10?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.521
While we were dating,
Pedro did tell me

00:22.523 --> 00:25.290
about his dad
and how he was around

00:25.292 --> 00:28.260
in some capacity, and then just,

00:28.262 --> 00:30.229
poof, disappeared.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.730
It pains him.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.244
[Pedro speaking]

00:47.814 --> 00:49.181
[Alejandro speaking]

00:49.183 --> 00:51.216
[Pedro in Spanish]

00:52.886 --> 00:55.821
[in Spanish]

01:07.267 --> 01:10.335
[upbeat foreign music playing]

01:15.675 --> 01:17.076
[Pedro speaking]

01:17.078 --> 01:18.944
<i>[Chantel] Hey.</i>

01:18.946 --> 01:21.513
[Chantel] Um, I missed you.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.215
[Pedro speaking]

02:10.396 --> 02:13.065
<i>[Chantel] You fought?
What are you talking about?</i>

02:14.267 --> 02:15.367
Why?

02:19.272 --> 02:20.405
[Chantel] Tell me what happened.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.207
I need to know all the details.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.509
[Pedro]
What happened was like...

02:27.714 --> 02:30.382
What? He tried to
put you on the floor?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.583
He put his hands on you?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.619
[Pedro speaking]

02:35.088 --> 02:36.522
Why did you chase him?

02:36.524 --> 02:37.623
Oh, my gosh.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.925
You all were fighting
in the middle of the street?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.927
[Pedro speaking]

02:41.929 --> 02:43.695
Baby.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.001
Well, oh, my gosh.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.904
You're fighting because
someone says yo momma.

02:51.906 --> 02:56.108
This is stuff that you learn
in the first grade not to do.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.043
Were you embarrassed?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.914
I don't know if
you were raised right.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.917
That means that you didn't learn

03:04.919 --> 03:07.486
not to fight like that
about yo momma jokes

03:07.488 --> 03:09.087
on the playground.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.097
Okay. So what else happened?

03:19.099 --> 03:21.233
[Pedro speaking]

03:24.337 --> 03:26.038
What did he throw at you?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.073
[Pedro speaking]

03:29.776 --> 03:32.010
<i>[Chantel] Oh,
he bought you some gift?</i>

03:33.446 --> 03:34.379
What was it?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.582
[Pedro speaking]

03:36.584 --> 03:37.883
<i>[Chantel] What...
And he threw it out?</i>

03:37.885 --> 03:39.585
<i>Did it hit you?</i>

03:40.920 --> 03:42.988
<i>Open it up.
Let's see what it was.</i>

03:49.128 --> 03:51.563
What is it?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.966
Is that for your beard, like,
is that what it is?

04:00.173 --> 04:01.573
Kind of.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.449
Oh, my God.
What does your sister think?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.085
[Pedro speaking]

04:24.931 --> 04:27.266
Hold on, this is all
so confusing to me.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.967
He's been talking to other girls

04:28.969 --> 04:33.005
but he said
he wants to marry your sister

04:33.007 --> 04:35.807
<i>as he is still married
to his wife?</i>

04:35.809 --> 04:37.042
Yup.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.644
That's not normal.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.379
[Pedro speaking]

04:40.381 --> 04:42.014
[Chantel]
<i>Well, uh, oh, my God.</i>

04:42.016 --> 04:44.616
This worries me so much.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.218
Did you win?

04:46.220 --> 04:48.253
[Pedro speaking]

04:49.656 --> 04:52.224
Baby, that is so dangerous.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.493
I'm just glad that you're okay.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.200
Whatever you need from me,

05:02.202 --> 05:06.204
just let me know
how I can be there for you.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.706
Love you.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.741
[Pedro speaking]

05:11.144 --> 05:13.278
[upbeat music playing]

05:23.022 --> 05:24.723
[Winter] Got it?
I'mma get in the car.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.558
- [Jah] I got it.
- [Winter] Okay.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.961
After our date night,
I was so ready

05:29.963 --> 05:33.398
and prepared to be mad at Jah,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.334
<i>because in my mind
even though this was like</i>

05:35.336 --> 05:37.169
<i>probably five, six years ago,</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:42.007
<i>he asked me to marry him
and then he produces a ring.</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:45.377
[Jah] You know, like I said,
like, at our dinner...

05:45.379 --> 05:46.578
- Yeah.
- [Jah] ...at our date,

05:46.580 --> 05:50.716
you thought that
I proposed before.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.883
You know, in my mind,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.552
I was giving you a promise ring.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.922
It was definitely something that

05:56.924 --> 06:01.193
I can admit that
I didn't communicate well.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.295
<i>At the time of the proposal,</i>

06:03.297 --> 06:06.164
I viewed it as
it wasn't something serious

06:06.166 --> 06:10.469
and I didn't look at that
as a proposal, you know.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.305
It's just immature mindset
on my part.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.006
Can I say something though?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.675
I'm not gonna lie
and say that it didn't,

06:16.677 --> 06:20.412
like, offend me that

06:20.414 --> 06:22.481
that wasn't the way you saw it.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.916
I mean, it was offensive,
of course,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.618
but I can definitely
understand, like,

06:26.620 --> 06:31.022
we were both young
and we were just young.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.594
I was hurt because
you didn't specify

06:35.596 --> 06:37.662
this was a promise ring.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.967
But I... I'm no longer
trying to operate

06:41.969 --> 06:44.403
in the state of being hurt,

06:44.405 --> 06:46.138
so I've already forgiven you.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.508
So things like that,
moving forward, are...

06:49.510 --> 06:51.543
They're just not gonna fly.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.781
I definitely want to

06:55.783 --> 06:57.949
take this relationship
seriously.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.987
I wanna immerse him
with my family

07:01.989 --> 07:04.689
<i>and I want to grow with him.</i>

07:04.691 --> 07:06.992
But I'm at this point
where I'm just like tired,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.693
like, if I'm with you,
I'm with you.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.896
If you're with me,
then we're together

07:10.898 --> 07:13.732
and let's do this.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.801
Well, I'm so excited that
you're coming with me

07:15.803 --> 07:17.803
to South Carolina.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.838
My mom and I,
we really haven't had

07:19.840 --> 07:21.540
a conversation about this trip.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.010
I really don't know
what to expect.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.978
But my family,
they're always saying

07:26.980 --> 07:28.180
how they don't know you

07:28.182 --> 07:29.981
and how they wanna
get to know you.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.817
And so I think that this is just

07:31.819 --> 07:33.718
the perfect opportunity for them

07:33.720 --> 07:35.220
- to have an opportunity...
- All right.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.688
[Winter] ...to talk to you
a little bit more.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.789
And just coming into the trip.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.991
- Answer their questions.
- Right.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.893
Even though I didn't wanna
answer they questions.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.495
- I don't wanna revisit it.
- I mean, but you kind of

07:43.497 --> 07:44.563
just... We just kind of
just like

07:44.565 --> 07:46.064
got to get over it though,
like, with my family.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.799
- [Jah] Yeah.
- You know?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.535
- We got to like get over...
- And this trip...

07:50.537 --> 07:53.405
I pray that we're gonna
get over it in this trip.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.975
- [Thomas] Mom.
- [Karen] Yes?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.211
- [Thomas] Are you ready?
- I'm ready for anything.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.613
- Any and everything.
- [Thomas] Yes.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.549
[Karen] Since my father
has passed a year ago,

08:04.551 --> 08:06.718
God rest his soul,

08:06.720 --> 08:09.454
<i>I've been very curious about
his side of the family.</i>

08:09.456 --> 08:10.856
<i>I knew there was a...</i>

08:10.858 --> 08:12.457
<i>There is a lake
in South Carolina</i>

08:12.459 --> 08:16.161
that bears our name,
so in researching that lake,

08:16.163 --> 08:19.030
something else came up
and what was that?

08:19.032 --> 08:22.701
Why it's a plantation
that bears our name on it.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.469
And through reading
on the website,

08:24.471 --> 08:30.475
I discovered
that they owned 27 slaves.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.712
What I wonder is,
could one of those 27 slaves

08:33.714 --> 08:37.048
be a direct relative of mine?

08:37.050 --> 08:41.119
<i>I'm really curious.
I reached out to a historian.</i>

08:41.121 --> 08:43.688
<i>So, I'm taking my family
on a road trip</i>

08:43.690 --> 08:47.125
<i>to find out
what he has discovered.</i>

08:47.127 --> 08:48.393
Do you have the keys there?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.528
I don't have the keys.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.062
- [River] Mama, do you?
- [Chantel] Okay. Oh, my gosh.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.197
Who's got the keys to the Jeep?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.231
[River] I got the key, man.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.266
Do I need to go in my own car?

08:54.268 --> 08:55.534
- [Thomas] Come on, man.
- I got the keys, man.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.868
- I got the keys.
- You know we're already

08:56.870 --> 08:58.770
- on edge about the trip, man.
- [River] You know I'm saying?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.772
<i>[River] I feel like
after my grandfather passed,</i>

09:00.774 --> 09:02.507
my mom kind of, uh,

09:02.509 --> 09:04.442
really wanted to, like,
just research more

09:04.444 --> 09:06.711
and, uh, find out
where we come from.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.979
And my mama, she's always been

09:07.981 --> 09:09.281
- a history bug...
- Yeah.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.649
[River] She...
I used to see her

09:10.651 --> 09:12.784
looking at my old
history books, you know.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.818
You know I'm saying?

09:13.820 --> 09:16.454
She did one of my history
projects for me.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.958
We failed but hey.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.826
[birds chirping]

09:21.828 --> 09:23.895
[Winter] Oh, there's my sister.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.935
Oh, well, not this one.
That's...

09:29.937 --> 09:31.503
I wanna keep that one. But...

09:31.505 --> 09:33.605
[Thomas] if she put her
effects, it's going on the top floor.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.706
thank you.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.575
[Thomas] You're welcome.
I want this bag on top.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.976
- Yes.
- [Chantel] Oh, there she is.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.511
- [River] Is that her?
- [Thomas] She's coming in?

09:39.513 --> 09:40.478
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.113
[River] Looks like
she has Jah with her.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.550
Jah? Is he coming?

09:45.552 --> 09:47.352
[Jah] Okay.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.954
Did you invite Jah to come, too?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.956
[Karen] Well, I did not,
but if he is,

09:50.958 --> 09:53.758
we really don't have...
We don't really have room.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.894
- [Winter] Hey, what's up?
- [Thomas] Things going well?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.329
- Yup.
- [Thomas] Yes, sir.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.830
- Go on and get it.
- [Winter] Hey, River.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.966
[Jah] Hello, Ms. Karen.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.004
So is Jah coming with us

10:06.006 --> 10:07.372
or is he just dropping you off?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.640
- [Winter] No, Jah...
- Yeah, I'm coming.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.908
Of course Jah is coming with me.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.476
Yeah.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.885
<i>[Chantel] I saw Jah
and I was like,</i>

10:20.887 --> 10:23.555
<i>really, like,
what are you doing here, bud?</i>

10:23.557 --> 10:26.024
It was awkward,
a long awkward silence,

10:26.026 --> 10:28.059
<i>a long awkward pause.</i>

10:29.595 --> 10:32.030
<i>We stood there
and we looked at him,</i>

10:32.032 --> 10:33.665
<i>and he looked at us.</i>

10:33.667 --> 10:35.967
And we looked right back
at him and he looked at us.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.036
And I'm like,
"Are you gonna leave?"

10:40.373 --> 10:42.741
I thought this was just
a family trip.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.311
I didn't know that
we were bringing plus ones.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.546
Well, we bring plus ones
every other time and...

10:48.548 --> 10:50.215
- [Chantel] When?
- I mean, I think

10:50.217 --> 10:52.984
it's a perfect opportunity
for us to all bond.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.557
[Karen] I'm surprised that
you're here but,

10:59.559 --> 11:02.394
uh, you're welcome to come.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.863
- [Thomas] Oh, yes.
- Okay. Thank you.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.532
Okay.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.733
[River] So maybe
we should do this...

11:08.735 --> 11:11.169
Maybe the girls
can go on one car

11:11.171 --> 11:12.671
and the guys can go on one car.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.339
We're just gonna drive our car.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.940
Okay.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.009
Well, Jah and Winter,
you are gonna follow us

11:18.011 --> 11:20.278
and let's get rolling.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.181
[Niurka speaking]

11:23.183 --> 11:24.449
[Pedro in Spanish]

11:29.722 --> 11:32.724
[in Spanish]

11:41.901 --> 11:44.602
[in Spanish]

11:44.604 --> 11:47.639
[Coraima in Spanish]

11:57.850 --> 12:00.385
<i>[River] Let's get this show
on the road.</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:02.087
[Karen] All right.
Thank you.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.422
That was a little awkward.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.894
I was very surprised to see Jah.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.563
Well, he wasn't even invited

12:11.565 --> 12:13.631
to my graduation party either.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.867
- [River] Well, okay.
- He's just stepping in

12:15.869 --> 12:18.236
on our family events.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.838
But I feel like... I feel like
we're at a crossroads

12:19.840 --> 12:22.140
because do you want him to
come around more

12:22.142 --> 12:23.541
or you don't want him to
come around at all?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.743
Like what...
like what's going on?

12:24.745 --> 12:27.212
You know, at this point,
I'm not even sure.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.179
[Thomas] I agree with River.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.748
If he doesn't come around,
it's a problem.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.015
If he comes around,
it's a problem.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.217
[Chantel] Well,
I just would like to know

12:32.219 --> 12:33.585
- before he gets here.
- [Thomas] So where is

12:33.587 --> 12:35.420
- the happy median?
- I would just like to know

12:35.422 --> 12:37.088
before he gets here
and that would be a happily...

12:37.090 --> 12:38.923
A happy median.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.358
I mean,
we coordinated everything

12:40.360 --> 12:42.494
down to our outfits that
we were gonna wear.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.062
- Yes, we did. Yeah.
- So I don't know

12:44.064 --> 12:46.231
why Winter didn't
get on the phone

12:46.233 --> 12:47.532
and say, "Hey, heads up...

12:47.534 --> 12:48.666
[Karen] She could have
just said...

12:48.668 --> 12:49.667
I'm gonna bring Jah
with me."

12:49.669 --> 12:51.536
[Karen] Yeah.
Really, I really feel that

12:51.538 --> 12:55.774
she should have said that
she's bringing Jah with her.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.475
But we just have to
see how he does.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.477
Every time he comes,
he always up to something.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.413
He don't do nothing
except for lie.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.485
[Winter] I just assumed
that they assumed

13:07.487 --> 13:08.987
that you were coming.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.455
You know, you've come
to the graduation.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.957
- Right.
- [Winter] I feel like

13:12.959 --> 13:17.862
you coming on this trip
is going to help my family.

13:17.864 --> 13:21.599
And mainly, my sister see that
we are working things out.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.536
[Jah] Hopefully,
she won't be overbearing.

13:24.538 --> 13:28.473
It's kind of lame,
you know I'm saying?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.175
Yeah.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.776
[upbeat music playing]

13:31.778 --> 13:34.479
[Karen] I can feel
a little something coming on.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.780
- I feel like...
- [River] Feel a little

13:35.782 --> 13:37.248
- something, something coming?
- That's right.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.950
There is a disturbance
in the force.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.952
[River] In the force.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.888

just bubbling up

13:43.890 --> 13:46.191

about my family.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.635
<i>Through my own research,</i>

21:44.637 --> 21:48.539
I found that my ancestors
might have been slaves

I mean, I found out
as much as I could

21:56.449 --> 22:00.251
but, you know, there's
just so far you can go.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.952
<i>[Chantel] I think that
my whole family thinks</i>

22:01.954 --> 22:05.222
that it's bizarre that Winter
brought Jah on this trip

22:05.224 --> 22:08.259
especially without telling us
ahead of time.

22:08.261 --> 22:11.462
But everybody is trying
to keep it calm,

22:11.464 --> 22:13.764

for the fact that

22:13.766 --> 22:15.533

22:15.535 --> 22:17.368
<i>an intimate thing
for our family.</i>

22:17.370 --> 22:20.438
And we're not trying to
let things get too crazy

22:20.440 --> 22:22.273
because we're meeting
a historian

22:22.275 --> 22:24.642
for a very serious purpose.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.243
You have to know who you are.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.713
That's the only way to change

22:28.715 --> 22:32.917
some of these trajectories
of our life.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.985
- [Thomas] Yes.
- Yes.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.689
You know, we got a lot
of problems with usury

22:38.691 --> 22:40.458
going on around here.

22:40.460 --> 22:45.262
So I felt like I really need
to get to the root of it.

22:45.264 --> 22:49.233
We seem to be attracting
a whole lot of users

22:49.235 --> 22:51.168
to our family.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.705
You must think that
my daughter is like a store.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.006
But guess what?

22:56.008 --> 22:58.509
Nothing's for sale.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.711
<i>I believe that
their family thinks</i>

23:00.713 --> 23:02.213
<i>that our family is a business,</i>

23:02.215 --> 23:04.782
like, fruit of the womb.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.284
[Chantel] You do believe
that Angenette was fishing,

23:07.286 --> 23:08.986
fishing for an American guy.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.156

it's all related</i>

23:12.158 --> 23:17.561
to get money out of men
in my family.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.998
I believe I can change
the trajectory

23:21.000 --> 23:26.704
of the life of my family,
my children.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.173
I can cut off
that spirit of usury.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.510
It seems like
Mr. Aldridge is here.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.011
- Oh, hello.
- [Karen] Hello.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.312
[Thomas] Hey,
how are you doing today?

23:35.314 --> 23:36.647
- Hi.
- [Karen] How are you today?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.048
[Dan] Hi, I'm fine.
It's a pleasure

23:38.050 --> 23:39.517
to finally
get to meet you, Karen,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.118
and the whole family.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.720
I'm Dan Aldridge.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.956
I'm a professor of History
and Africana studies

23:45.958 --> 23:47.491
at Davidson College.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.193
<i>Karen reached out to me,</i>

23:49.195 --> 23:53.397
<i>uh, to help her
find her ancestors.</i>

23:53.399 --> 23:55.566
It's so hard
to trace your ancestry

23:55.568 --> 23:58.035
for African-Americans
because most people

23:58.037 --> 23:59.570
can't find a record

23:59.572 --> 24:01.772
where a slave ancestor
was named,

24:01.774 --> 24:05.042
you know, and that you can
trace directly to yourselves.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.412
We are right now
in the place in Winnsboro

24:08.414 --> 24:13.083
where the plantation of a family

24:13.085 --> 24:14.685
that may very well be connected

24:14.687 --> 24:16.520
to yours lives, you know?

24:16.522 --> 24:18.589
Yes, that is exciting.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.925
[Dan] So what we've done here

24:20.927 --> 24:22.893
is we've gone
through your ancestry

24:22.895 --> 24:24.195
starting with your father,

24:24.197 --> 24:26.397
- James P. Wiley.
- Yes. Yes.

24:26.399 --> 24:30.234
[Dan] What we found is that
there was a slave owner

24:30.236 --> 24:32.703
named Thomas Wily II.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.039
In his will,

24:35.041 --> 24:38.609
he transferred
his Negro boy George...

24:38.611 --> 24:41.178
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm.
- aged about 15 years...

24:41.180 --> 24:43.380
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm.
- to other people in his family.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.116
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Dan] A second thing that's of interest

24:46.118 --> 24:49.220
is we found your ancestor,
George Wiley,

24:49.222 --> 24:51.789
in the 1870 census.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.058
Now this is South Carolina
after the Civil War.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.660
Slaves were freed in 1865

24:56.662 --> 25:00.464
and George Wiley
had a 40-acre farm.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.466
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm.
- [Dan] And by the standards

25:02.468 --> 25:05.769
of someone who was just
freed from slavery,

25:05.771 --> 25:08.339
five years before
in South Carolina...

25:08.341 --> 25:10.407
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm.
- he has a good amount of property.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.842
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
- [Thomas] Yup.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.143
- Well off...
- [Thomas] Yes.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.778
by slave standards.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.448
So I wonder, how could a slave,

25:17.450 --> 25:19.783
someone just freed
from slavery five years ago,

25:19.785 --> 25:21.619
earn enough cash
to buy 40 acres?

25:21.621 --> 25:22.920
[Jah speaking]

25:22.922 --> 25:24.788
[Dan]
One possibility, of course,

25:24.790 --> 25:26.624
is their being relatives.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.660
- [Jah] Yeah.
- That's common on plantation.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.995
Because slave masters used to...

25:30.997 --> 25:32.496
slave masters used to
rape the slaves.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.965
[Dan] Yeah. So it's possible
they're related.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.269
And somehow
the family gave George

25:38.271 --> 25:40.471
an amount of acreage.

25:40.473 --> 25:44.642
So it's likely that this George

25:44.644 --> 25:46.577
we find in the Will
is your ancestor.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.445
Wow.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.848
-That was... That was my suspicion.
-[Dan] It was a very...

25:50.850 --> 25:52.583
Here's a book that
has information

25:52.585 --> 25:54.919
about all your ancestors
going back.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.654
For example.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.055
[Karen] Oh, who's that?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.190
[Dan] Here's what we believe
was a photograph

26:00.192 --> 26:02.259
of George Wiley,
when he's older,

26:02.261 --> 26:04.528
when he's freed
many years later.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.697
[Karen]
That looks like my dad.

26:10.368 --> 26:12.670
It's amazing
that he has a picture.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.506
I'm so excited.
This is so interesting.

26:15.508 --> 26:19.043
We're not free as long
as we are not aware.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.479
If we don't know who we are,
we're not free.

26:22.481 --> 26:25.549
My interest is you guys.

26:25.551 --> 26:29.153
- Right.
- I want to set you guys free.

26:29.155 --> 26:32.523
I want everything
made right for you guys.

26:32.525 --> 26:34.325
- Yes.
- I'm immensely grateful

26:34.327 --> 26:35.693
for everything
that you've done for us.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.861
- Uh-huh.
- You have no idea.

26:37.863 --> 26:41.165
Well, thank you that
I could be of some service.

to be in this category

- Mmm-hmm.

[Nicole speaking in Spanish]

31:15.039 --> 31:18.876
[Coraima speaking in Spanish]

31:24.482 --> 31:27.784
We follow a, uh, Biblical diet.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.287
[Chantel] I don't believe
that God's gonna send you

31:30.289 --> 31:31.922
to hell for eating a shrimp.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.190
You eat a bottom feeder,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.158
you think, like a bottom feeder.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.260
- And I...
- Who are you saying

31:36.262 --> 31:37.861
thinks like a bottom feeder?

31:37.863 --> 31:41.398
Wait a minute. Wait just a...
just a damn minute.

31:44.369 --> 31:46.103
[dramatic music playing]

31:49.674 --> 31:51.408
[Karen] After meeting
the historian,

31:51.410 --> 31:52.709
we're going to a dinner.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.044
And I believe that

31:54.046 --> 31:56.380
this would be
a very good time for us

31:56.382 --> 31:58.949
to reflect on the things
that we've learned

31:58.951 --> 32:02.753
and the information
and the time that we've had.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.789
This is a nice courtyard
we have here.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.524
[Karen]
<i>So we're going to sit down,</i>

32:07.526 --> 32:09.660
<i>have some nice dinner,</i>

32:09.662 --> 32:11.428
enjoy one another's company.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.264
- Peacefully.
- Peacefully.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.034
Oh my gosh, you young ladies,

32:17.036 --> 32:19.136
I don't know why
you didn't give me the memo.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.139
I totally could have
gone leopard

32:22.141 --> 32:23.440
just like the two of you.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.175
[imitates cat growl]

32:27.078 --> 32:29.413
It's all in here, mom,
you got to get connected.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.615
Well, yeah. Well, you know
what's kind of hard, my...

32:31.617 --> 32:33.884
I was a little off today
with my energy

32:33.886 --> 32:37.321
learning about
my great-great-grandfather.

32:37.323 --> 32:40.557
It's just a lot to take in.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.225
How did you feel about it,
Jah? I noticed...

32:42.227 --> 32:43.927
- I thought it was interesting.
- [Karen] Yes.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.129
It was an intriguing,
um, conversation.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.699
That's the conversations
that I like.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.767
I see.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.603
<i>[River] South Carolina
was supposed to be, um,</i>

32:53.605 --> 32:55.605
<i>just for family, you know,</i>

32:55.607 --> 32:57.808
and Jah and Winter,
they're not married

32:57.810 --> 33:00.043
so, uh, he's not really family.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.045
<i>I don't know why
he's here but, uh,</i>

33:02.047 --> 33:04.014
<i>I'mma find out like I should.</i>

33:04.016 --> 33:06.316
So it's on everybody's mind.
Everybody's thinking about...

33:06.318 --> 33:07.617
Everybody's thinking
the same thing.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.952
What the hell is he doing here?

33:08.954 --> 33:11.188
- So Jah...
- [Karen] Wait, wait.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.756
[River] Uh, I will say this.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.891
I think, like,
my grandfather's passing

33:14.893 --> 33:17.194
is still fresh so it's like
this was like a big thing

33:17.196 --> 33:18.695
for my family, you know.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.198
And for Winter not to,
like, tell us like,

33:21.200 --> 33:22.799
you know she was gonna
bring a plus one,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.701
not telling us she was gonna
bring you, it kind of, like,

33:24.703 --> 33:25.702
it just shook the whole mood,

33:25.704 --> 33:26.837
the whole vibe a little bit.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.438
- [Winter] Okay.
- [Jah] I totally understand, man.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.173
You know, rest in peace to
your grandfather, all respect.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.808
You know, he passed away
on my birthday.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.143
- So I totally...
- [Karen] Thank you.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.845
- I didn't know that.
- [Jah] ...I understand and that's

33:34.847 --> 33:36.880
-what I was saying, like...
-Thank you, Jah. I appreciate that.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.515
What I wanna know is,
you coming along,

33:38.517 --> 33:40.217
is that like, kind of
like you're trying to

33:40.219 --> 33:41.485
like come around more, like,

33:41.487 --> 33:43.053
and opening yourself up, like...

33:43.055 --> 33:44.888
Yeah. That was the intention,

33:44.890 --> 33:47.924
to come out to support Winter

33:47.926 --> 33:49.659
and to support you, guys.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.062
You know, it's been so long.
So it's like, uh,

33:52.064 --> 33:53.730
what makes you wanna do it now

33:53.732 --> 33:55.499
other than like doing it
like in the beginning?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.933
Like coming around, you know,

33:56.935 --> 33:58.368
showing your face a little more.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.437
Uh, well it didn't
it didn't feel...

34:00.439 --> 34:03.774
it didn't feel
natural to me, um,

34:03.776 --> 34:05.442
being around you guys, you know.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.177
[Karen] Why? Why, Jah?
How come it didn't feel

34:07.179 --> 34:08.779
natural for you to be around us?

34:08.781 --> 34:10.580
- [Jah] Uh, you know, because...
- I mean, mom, come on.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.682
-We've... You are...
-[Karen] I mean, we've been... I... Listen.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.384
- Mom.
- Because of my heritage, because of my belief,

34:14.386 --> 34:15.752
you know what I'm saying?

34:17.622 --> 34:19.523
<i>My belief is called Nazarene.</i>

34:19.525 --> 34:20.957
We just believe in the Bible.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.727
We believe in keeping
the high holy days,

34:23.729 --> 34:26.163
we believe, um, you know,

34:26.165 --> 34:30.167
that it's a sin
to practice any paganism.

34:30.169 --> 34:33.070
<i>What qualifies
as paganism is eating pork</i>

34:33.072 --> 34:34.838
<i>or shrimp or bottom feeders.</i>

34:34.840 --> 34:38.508
You know, Christmas,
Thanksgiving, they're Pagan days.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.510
Easter's just another, uh,

34:40.512 --> 34:42.045
really supposed to be Passover,

34:42.047 --> 34:44.581
but then they got a Easter bunny

34:44.583 --> 34:46.316
that lays eggs
and all of that stuff,

34:46.318 --> 34:48.318
it's all pagan.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.654
<i>I wasn't born
into being a Nazarene.</i>

34:50.656 --> 34:53.657
<i>When I met winter,
I was just coming into that,</i>

34:53.659 --> 34:56.593
but I'm extremely devout
to my belief

34:56.595 --> 34:59.830
and Winter's...
She's taken interest in it.

35:01.799 --> 35:05.569
Being around you guys is
kind of contrary to my walk.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.004
To be around us
is contrary to your walk?

35:08.006 --> 35:09.506
- [Chantel] Which walk?
- [Karen] What do you mean?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.341
-Explain to me.
-[Chantel] Where are you going?

35:11.343 --> 35:14.778
- What's going on?
- Why is it contrary for you to be around us?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.114
So Jah adopted
this new religion.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.949
And convinced Winter to follow.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.017
And convinced Winter to follow.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.621
<i>[Chantel] I have no problem
with anybody's religion,</i>

35:24.623 --> 35:28.859
but it seems like he has
influenced her deeply

35:28.861 --> 35:33.330
into changing the way
she interacts with her family.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.298
This is a family portrait.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.300
You guys did not say
that it was gonna be

35:37.302 --> 35:39.569
a ugly Christmas sweater.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.171
What's wrong with Christmas?

35:41.173 --> 35:43.340
I don't celebrate Christmas.

35:44.609 --> 35:46.376
- There you go.
- All right.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.811
Did we decide on anything yet?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.913
Let me get the publico burger.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.182
And there's no, um,
no pork in it, right?

35:52.184 --> 35:54.684
Oh, he needs everything kosher.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.319
- [woman] Everything kosher?
- And you, too, huh?

35:56.321 --> 35:58.388
Who said kosher?

35:58.390 --> 35:59.923
[Chantel]
You guys don't eat kosher?

35:59.925 --> 36:00.924
No.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.228
Winter told me
that she was kosher.

36:05.230 --> 36:08.698
Kosher is when the food has
been prepared a certain way.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.401
<i>Also, they have all
other kinds of rules</i>

36:11.403 --> 36:13.670
<i>like eating pork and shellfish.</i>

36:13.672 --> 36:16.907
You can't do that.
But at the dinner,

36:16.909 --> 36:20.043
Jah says that
they don't eat kosher,

36:20.045 --> 36:21.745
and it's crazy to me

36:21.747 --> 36:23.180
that Winter's a part
of a religion

36:23.182 --> 36:25.315
that she still
doesn't even understand.

36:25.317 --> 36:28.518
Oh, well, what is... what
is that you, like what is it?

36:28.520 --> 36:32.355
We follow a, uh, Biblical diet.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.994
Well, I don't believe

36:37.996 --> 36:39.663
that God's gonna send you
to hell

36:39.665 --> 36:41.198
- for eating a shrimp.
- [Karen] I don't think so.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.066
Listen, I know I'm not
going to hell.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.435
- For eating a shrimp.
- You eat a bottom feeder,

36:45.437 --> 36:47.470
you think like a bottom feeder.

36:51.075 --> 36:53.743
Who are you saying thinks
like a bottom feeder?

36:53.745 --> 36:57.314
Wait a minute. Wait just a...
just a damn minute.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.583
I'm the one who welcomed you

36:59.585 --> 37:02.018
into this event

37:02.020 --> 37:05.989
to teach you about
my heritage, my ancestors.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.090
Yeah, and everything was great.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.558
And you know things now

37:08.560 --> 37:09.893
that happened
that I didn't even...

37:09.895 --> 37:11.394
I didn't even know until today.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.629
And you learned it
with everybody.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.431
Now what do we know
about you, Jah?

37:17.902 --> 37:19.269
[Karen] Now,
what you got to say?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.713
[dramatic music playing]

37:29.715 --> 37:32.015
I'm the one who welcomed you

37:32.017 --> 37:35.285
into this event to teach you

37:35.287 --> 37:38.488
about my heritage, my ancestors.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.522
Yeah, and everything was great.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.124
And you know things now

37:41.126 --> 37:42.692
that happened
that I didn't even...

37:42.694 --> 37:44.194
I didn't even know until today,

37:44.196 --> 37:45.428
and you learned it
with everybody.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.497
Now what do we know
about you, Jah?

37:47.499 --> 37:49.032
[Karen] Now,
what you got to say?

37:52.903 --> 37:54.804
Let's celebrate our differences.

37:56.641 --> 37:59.075
He must be the bottom feeder

37:59.077 --> 38:01.411
and he must think
like a bottom feeder

38:01.413 --> 38:03.680
because it was him
that didn't tell Winter

38:03.682 --> 38:06.916
that he had two children
six years ago.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.886
Jah is not practicing
what he preaches.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.322
Look at the things
that he has not told Winter.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.590
It's like, you know,

38:13.592 --> 38:15.025
- contradicting himself, so.
- I know.

38:15.027 --> 38:17.227
He can't judge me
and tell me that I eat

38:17.229 --> 38:19.863
and think like a bottom feeder.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.032
Come on.

38:22.034 --> 38:24.000
[Chantel] It shouldn't be
like pulling teeth

38:24.002 --> 38:25.769
to get to know you
after six years

38:25.771 --> 38:27.604
of dating my sister.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.042
I made a mistake
coming to this trip, you know.

38:32.044 --> 38:33.777
- I should have stayed home.
- I'm sorry.

38:33.779 --> 38:34.878
I didn't mean to do that to you.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.081
Um, it was, definitely, uh,

38:38.083 --> 38:40.617
definitely
a stressful situation.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.120
[River] Oh, the food is here.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.855
That's a good thing.
Yeah. But I'm gonna say

38:45.857 --> 38:48.558
as I, you know,
as far as beliefs go,

38:48.560 --> 38:50.026
you know, everybody has their...

38:50.028 --> 38:51.261
[Karen] Everybody has
their own beliefs.

38:51.263 --> 38:52.662
Everybody has their own
beliefs but it's like,

38:52.664 --> 38:54.464
you know, we wanna
get to know you, you know.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.799
- And we want you to know us.
- Thank you.

38:55.801 --> 38:56.933
You know,
because you're gonna be

38:56.935 --> 38:58.435
- a part of Winter's life, you know.
- Right.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.170
- No.
- I'm not trying to

39:00.172 --> 39:02.172
force my beliefs on you,
you know.

39:02.174 --> 39:05.775
But your sister, Chantel,
and your mother

39:05.777 --> 39:07.977
is trying to force
their beliefs on Winter.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.846
- [Chantel] What?
- That is not true.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.981
[Chantel] She had beliefs
before you came along.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.785
If anybody is forcing beliefs
on anybody, it's you.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.454
- [Karen] Seeing Winter...
- Okay. But then why was it

39:17.456 --> 39:19.356
a big deal
at the Christmas party...

39:19.358 --> 39:21.591
- Right.
- that I didn't wanna wear Christmas sweater?

39:21.593 --> 39:23.793
You made that a big deal.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.428
[Chantel] I don't feel
like the sweaters were

39:25.430 --> 39:27.163
the origin of your emotions
at that moment.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.132
[Winter] The sweaters,
it started it, okay?

39:29.134 --> 39:30.734
[Chantel] It started it,
but there was some other

39:30.736 --> 39:32.268
- underlying thing there as...
- The disrespect.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.404
- Yeah. Like I wasn't the one who started it.
- I wasn't disrespectful.

39:34.406 --> 39:35.472
You were disrespectful.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.840
As soon as I started to speak,
that was...

39:36.842 --> 39:37.941
You weren't there, Jah.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.008
Okay. Okay. Okay.
But... Okay.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.143
I was there.
I was there.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.611
- You weren't there.
- [River] Okay. Listen.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.079
You spoke on my name
and I wasn't even there.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.014
-Of course.
-[River] Now listen. Wait, wait. Listen, listen...

39:45.016 --> 39:46.483
I will. I have that right,
it's a free country.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.251
[River] Okay.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.387
Oh my gosh.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.856
Well, Chantel
doesn't like change.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.458
<i>When people change, she
has a hard time accepting that,</i>

39:55.460 --> 39:57.494
you know, like
it's really because

39:57.496 --> 39:59.596
Chantel feels like you, uh,

39:59.598 --> 40:01.965
are saying you're
better than her,

40:01.967 --> 40:03.633
like, she doesn't...
That's what she...

40:03.635 --> 40:05.568
- I'm being honest.
- I know.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.070
I think that's just
the insecurity she has.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.538
I get that feeling, too.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.440
- I think that's the insecurity she has.
- But I don't understand why.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.008
- Because I haven't...
- I don't know why either.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.810
I haven't said hey,
I'm not eating,

40:13.812 --> 40:15.011
you don't need to eat it,
don't eat it.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.513
I haven't been doing that.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.947
- It's just...
- You have done it a few times.

40:17.949 --> 40:18.948
- I... No.
- A few times.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.250
I never did that to Chantel.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.751
No, I never.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.952
Why are we trying
to relive this?

40:22.954 --> 40:25.155
- [Jah] Right.
- Because Jah said

40:25.157 --> 40:27.957
that we're trying to impose
our beliefs on Winter,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.993
but these are the beliefs
that she was born with.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.861
[Karen]
The cards are on the table,

40:31.863 --> 40:35.965
it's to you to prove yourself

40:35.967 --> 40:38.435
if you are who you say you are,

40:38.437 --> 40:40.136
go ahead and show us, okay?

40:40.138 --> 40:41.838
- That's one thing.
- Okay.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.941
[Karen] I believe that actions
speak louder than words.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.813
And I... I'm gonna keep
my eye on you, all right?

40:49.815 --> 40:51.381
- Okay.
- [Karen] All right.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.018
<i>[Jah] At this point,
I'm kind of done,</i>

40:55.020 --> 40:58.321
<i>you know, I find her
speech to me offensive.</i>

40:58.323 --> 41:00.924
You know, I don't take
that disrespect at all.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.693
And my belief, there is no
matriarch type of believe.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.062
This is...
This is a patriarch belief.

41:06.064 --> 41:11.134
So I don't wanna have
nothing to do with Mrs. Karen

41:11.136 --> 41:13.736
at this moment right now.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.505
[Karen] And I mean what I say.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.340
And I will be watching you.

41:17.342 --> 41:20.376
[tense music playing]

41:22.680 --> 41:25.515
- [woman] Hey River.
- [River] Tonight, I'm going to meet Megan's friends

41:25.517 --> 41:28.151
and I'm nervous because I know
I'm gonna be in the hot seat.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.420
I hear that you
just stay at home.

41:30.422 --> 41:31.888
What's gonna make it
to where you're going to

41:31.890 --> 41:32.956
move out of your parents' house?

41:32.958 --> 41:34.224
Because like, honestly like

41:34.226 --> 41:36.226
she's not looking
for another kid.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.094
Oh, you think I'm a kid?

41:39.430 --> 41:44.901
[in Spanish]

41:44.903 --> 41:46.569
[Lidia speaking in Spanish]

41:54.512 --> 41:55.745
[Pedro speaking]

41:57.648 --> 41:58.915
Does she not want you to meet

41:58.917 --> 42:00.416
with your other side
of the family?

42:02.786 --> 42:04.587
I just wonder if your mom knew

42:04.589 --> 42:06.556
that he had another family.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.458
[Pedro speaking]

42:12.830 --> 42:16.032
[in Spanish]

42:16.034 --> 42:19.736
[in Spanish]

42:19.738 --> 42:21.404
[in Spanish]

42:21.406 --> 42:25.108
[tense music playing]
