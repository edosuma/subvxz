WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:03.294
- Jax!

00:03.378 --> 00:04.254
- I got it.

00:04.337 --> 00:04.921
- But what took you so long?

00:05.004 --> 00:06.923
- I had to run here.

00:07.006 --> 00:08.048
My powers don't work.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.718
- Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

00:11.177 --> 00:13.847
- Am I too late?
- Well, you better hope not!

00:15.849 --> 00:16.766
- Do it, Emma.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.059
- For most, a spell is hidden,

00:18.143 --> 00:19.227
for its results
are forbidden.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.478
But for me,
nothing is banned.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.313
As Chosen One,
I am in command.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.983
It will give me great joy
to turn Philip into a real boy!

00:31.698 --> 00:32.782
- Emma!

00:34.909 --> 00:35.785
- Are you okay?

00:35.869 --> 00:36.244
- Let me get her to the table.

00:38.872 --> 00:39.873
- Philip?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.045
- Andi?

00:46.129 --> 00:47.756
- You're okay!

00:50.383 --> 00:52.385
- Stop!

00:52.469 --> 00:53.636
- Ha! You're too late!

00:53.720 --> 00:55.472
- What have you done?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.306
- The right thing.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.767
- I expected more out of you.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.602
Out of both of you.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.605
- Em, how do you feel?

01:03.688 --> 01:05.522
- Not so good.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.025
- You shouldn't have done that.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.570
- Do you think
she's gonna be okay?

01:10.653 --> 01:12.071
- I don't know.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.866
- Amazing!

01:15.950 --> 01:17.285
- Hmm.
- Don't touch.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.329
- Wha--leave him alone!
- Ow!

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
I never thought
it could be done.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.833
Do you know how many frogs
it took

01:23.917 --> 01:25.001
for the principal to make a son?
Ha!

01:25.084 --> 01:28.963
- Wait, is everyone here
that was here?

01:29.047 --> 01:32.425
- What do you mean?
- Nobody's...missing?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.176
- No.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.345
Everything's fine.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.931
Philip's fine,
Emma's recuperating,

01:38.014 --> 01:39.641
and the realm
is still the realm.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.643
You were wrong.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.311
- So naive.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.564
So arrogant.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.774
- Me?

01:47.857 --> 01:49.526
What about you?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.820
You're so arrogant that
you can't even admit

01:51.903 --> 01:54.614
that she can do things
that you can't.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.574
- I would be careful
if I were you.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.160
- Once again, Mr. Novoa,

01:59.244 --> 02:00.995
you fail to see the point.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.789
- You're not helping!

02:02.872 --> 02:04.457
- Everything's okay!

02:04.541 --> 02:07.544
No one got turned
into a zombie, or a frog.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.836
We're good.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.547
- Andi, let's take Emma home.
She needs rest.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.382
- I'll take her home.
DANIEL: (sighing)

02:12.465 --> 02:13.341
Man, do not start this again!

02:13.424 --> 02:16.678
- This has nothing
to do with you.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.556
This is realm business only.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.016
- Emma came to me for help,
not you.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.101
- Are we absolutely sure
he's human?

02:23.184 --> 02:25.979
- No, he's also part dragon.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.063
- Oh.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.983
- I'm hungry.
DESDEMONA: Don't worry.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.860
You'll get a little
weaker...

02:31.943 --> 02:33.069
then better.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.029
- Daniel, your brothers
need a--

02:35.113 --> 02:35.363
Whoa.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.491
Daniel...

02:38.575 --> 02:39.742
- Hi, Mom.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.704
- What's...
going on here?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.448
Quit stalling
and let's go.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.699
I want my crystal back.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh...

03:19.782 --> 03:22.869
About that, I have
a shift later, and a curfew,

03:22.952 --> 03:24.370
so how long is this all
gonna take?

03:24.454 --> 03:26.247
- You still don't get it,
do you?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.498
This is a war.
There is no curfew.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.377
- (scoffs) Yeah, tell that
to my dad. And Maddie.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.504
Actually, she's the one
who gave me the curfew.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.423
The sleep is for
a clear complexion.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.258
- I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.885
If the witches give me
the necklace back,

03:38.968 --> 03:40.053
then fine, we're done.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.971
- And if not?
- Then we expose the realm,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.932
and you can go home
and get your beauty sleep.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.813
- Ah!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.982
- Just in case you were
thinking of warning them.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.778
- Mom, uh...

03:56.861 --> 03:59.822
- Daniel, who are
these people?

03:59.906 --> 04:00.990
- Um-- they, um--
- I'm Agamemnon,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.325
and-- and this
is Desdemona.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.370
- We don't have time
for this.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.164
- Whoa! Whoa--
Okay, what was that?

04:08.247 --> 04:09.958
Listen, I know Feng Shui,

04:10.041 --> 04:11.709
and I am not afraid to use it!
- Wait, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.669
Uh, she is-- and Agamem--

04:12.752 --> 04:15.546
- Now, don't freak,
Mrs. M.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.673
- Wha--
- Okay...

04:16.755 --> 04:18.298
This is Mr. Agamemnon
from school.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.511
He's our physics teacher,

04:21.594 --> 04:23.721
and he's here to tutor us
for the physics mid-term.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.848
CHRISTINE: Oh.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.518
- And this is Desdemona,
the lunch lady.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.603
She brought us snacks.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.897
- Sorry I didn't tell you
about the tutoring, Mom.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.190
I was embarrassed.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.027
- Oh, Danny, there is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.281
I mean, everyone needs
a little tutoring, right?

04:41.364 --> 04:42.532
- And snacks.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.575
- Yes, we were just
about to begin

04:44.659 --> 04:46.452
with subatomic particles, so...

04:46.536 --> 04:47.954
- Oh!
(students murmuring)

04:50.331 --> 04:52.500
- Um, Emma, sweetie,
are you okay?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.879
- I'm fine, just tired.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.007
- Well, you--you look
a little pale,

04:59.090 --> 05:00.633
so you let me know
if you need anything.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.767
- Oh!

05:09.851 --> 05:11.477
I've lost my powers.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.354
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely!

05:13.438 --> 05:15.314
If I had powers,
you would all be enjoying

05:15.398 --> 05:17.608
a hot Sahara breeze
right now.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.609
- It's the crystal.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.611
Emma dropped it
when she cast the spell.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.821
- (gasping)

05:21.904 --> 05:24.407
Great!
Now it's missing!

05:24.490 --> 05:25.700
- We have to find
that crystal,

05:25.783 --> 05:27.243
and dispose of it
immediately.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.662
- Be my guest,
but I'm taking Emma home.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.956
DANIEL: I'll take her home!
Um, wait!

05:32.040 --> 05:34.083
Before anyone leaves,

05:34.167 --> 05:38.671
we have to come up with
a suitable story for...him.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.965
ANDI: Don't worry.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.675
We already did.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.302
Philip's a Van Pelt.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.554
- Maddie Winkie, come on!

05:46.637 --> 05:48.598
Your brother's gonna
be home any minute,

05:48.681 --> 05:50.433
and I want to try
a new color.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.102
- I'm not casting
any more decorating spells.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.854
And he's not my brother.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.398
- Oh, Maddie Winkie,
now, don't be that way.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.358
You're still my favorite!
Yes, you are!

06:00.777 --> 06:03.488
For now.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.572
(phone chirping)

06:05.865 --> 06:07.158
- I think it's kind of cool

06:07.241 --> 06:08.326
that you're gonna have
an older brother.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.286
- Do you think Emma
will make me one too?

06:10.369 --> 06:11.454
- Oh, no!

06:11.537 --> 06:13.122
Grab my purse, we gotta go!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.500
Proxy says Mia wants
to expose the realm!

06:15.583 --> 06:16.501
- What?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.669
SOPHIE: Oh, this is so exciting!

06:18.753 --> 06:21.631
I wish I had a cape.
Oh, wait! I do!

06:22.757 --> 06:24.425
(squealing excitedly)

06:24.509 --> 06:25.301
- They're heading to school.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.929
Let's go.
KATIE: Okay.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.140
- Sometimes, I just feel
like a superhero.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.851
What would the realm
do without me?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.650
- Wait for me!
(giggling)

06:43.694 --> 06:45.530
- Witches are so messy!
(scoffing)

06:45.613 --> 06:47.323
Another reason
not to like them.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.158
- Somebody obviously
ransacked the place.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.327
- Oh.
They better not have--

06:52.912 --> 06:54.664
No! They stole
the Cristal de Caballero.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.334
- (laughing)
That's funny how you say that.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.001
"The Cristal de Caballero!"

06:59.085 --> 07:01.754
(laughing)

07:01.838 --> 07:03.339
- Stop laughing!

07:05.716 --> 07:06.884
- Stop that!

07:08.219 --> 07:10.179
Give me the card.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.348
- No way!
And stop asking me.

07:12.431 --> 07:13.307
- Give...
(grunting)

07:13.391 --> 07:16.686
me the card!
- (chuckling)

07:16.769 --> 07:17.770
- Give me the card!

07:17.854 --> 07:18.980
(electricity sparking)
Ow!

07:19.063 --> 07:20.064
- No!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.357
I'm going to upload it,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.025
and let the whole world see
who they really are.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.068
- Give it to me!

07:24.152 --> 07:26.696
- Let go!
- No!

07:26.779 --> 07:28.156
- Diego, stop it!

07:28.239 --> 07:29.657
You're hurting yourself!

07:29.740 --> 07:30.491
- Unh!

07:35.413 --> 07:36.998
- You're okay.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.292
Just... don't be
so stubborn next time.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.052
DANIEL: Em...

07:50.136 --> 07:52.054
you're home.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.308
- What happened?

07:55.391 --> 07:57.310
- You fainted.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.270
You exerted yourself
with Phillip's spell.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.397
- Did it work?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.065
- You don't remember?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.192
- Barely.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.945
- It did.
And it was amazing.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.739
You could see the light
wash over him,

08:09.822 --> 08:12.200
and the colors--
- Where is everybody?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.327
- At my house,
looking for the crystal.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.707
- Whoa.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.043
I'm still a little dizzy.
- Yeah.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.711
Just lay back.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.588
Desdemona said
you'd be fine.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.548
You just have to rest
and let your powers recharge.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.635
- Desdemona?
The Council knows?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.845
- Man, you really
don't remember.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.514
Yeah, they do.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.640
They weren't too happy,

08:35.722 --> 08:37.433
but nothing happened
to the realm,

08:37.515 --> 08:40.186
so...we're good.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.273
- Come on, twitchy,
let's go!

08:44.357 --> 08:45.358
- Whoo!

08:45.441 --> 08:46.692
All that electricity
woke me right up.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.487
Where are we going?
- Daniel's house.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.447
That's where they are.
- How do you know?

08:51.530 --> 08:52.657
- I found your second phone.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.201
- My emergency phone?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.370
That's only meant to be used
during emergencies.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.663
- This was an emergency.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.082
I urgently needed
to know where Emma's at.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.792
- Okay, so you
only texted Daniel.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.962
You didn't happen to see
any other texts, did you?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.130
- Of course not...
"muffin."

09:08.214 --> 09:10.549
- You shouldn't go
through people's phones!

09:10.633 --> 09:11.842
It's just rude!

09:13.761 --> 09:15.638
- Diego?
What are you doing here?

09:15.721 --> 09:20.351
- Um, we were, um--
we were just-- uh--

09:20.434 --> 09:21.519
- We were just leaving.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.062
- Keep answering like that,

09:23.145 --> 09:25.147
and you'll make "Mean Girl
of the Month" on my blog.

09:25.231 --> 09:25.773
- Thank you!

09:28.567 --> 09:31.070
What was that?
Stammering and stuttering.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.655
- I'm a Kanay.
We don't lie.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.323
- Maybe in the old days.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.700
- For someone who
pretends to uphold

09:35.783 --> 09:37.159
our heritage so much,

09:37.243 --> 09:40.371
you certainly pick and choose
the laws you follow.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.332
- You're right.
I shouldn't lie.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.625
(whistling)

09:44.709 --> 09:45.918
- What?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.254
- Remember that memory card
you wanted repaired?

09:48.337 --> 09:50.506
It's in the nurse's office,
fixed.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.758
- How do you know
about my memory card?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.260
- Because I'm Black Hawk.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.512
- Nice try!
But, Sophie's Black Hawk.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.596
I saw her.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.181
- Well, I can be Sophie, too.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.433
- Shh, shh, shh.
What are you doing?

10:00.516 --> 10:03.185
Don't do that!
Ha!

10:03.269 --> 10:05.021
She was kidding!
(laughing)

10:05.104 --> 10:06.480
Whoo, you're hilarious,
Mia.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.274
Uh, I'll see you
at home, okay?

10:09.608 --> 10:11.235
- I thought you said
Kanays told the truth.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.195
And, I just told the truth.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.158
- Ah!
(grunting)

10:22.121 --> 10:25.207
- Being without my powers
is most disconcerting!

10:25.291 --> 10:27.168
- Oh, tell me about it!

10:27.251 --> 10:28.169
- I know it's here somewhere.
I can feel it

10:28.252 --> 10:31.547
zapping my powers!

10:31.630 --> 10:33.841
JAX: Search the closet?
- Good idea!

10:33.924 --> 10:35.384
- Why don't we just
leave it here,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.219
and never step foot
in Daniel's house ever again?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.679
- No! We must not,
once again,

10:38.763 --> 10:42.600
let the crystal
fall into evil hands.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.936
- So, "Aggie,"
if I find the crystal,

10:46.020 --> 10:47.355
will you make me
a guardian in training?

10:47.438 --> 10:49.106
- Oh, well...

10:49.190 --> 10:51.400
No, I believe that ship
has sailed.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.195
And do not
call me "Aggie."

10:54.278 --> 10:55.237
- (chuckling)
Aggie, Aggie, Aggie!

10:55.321 --> 10:57.990
- (laughing)

10:58.074 --> 11:00.951
Yeah, okay, okay,
no need for a wizard tantrum.

11:01.035 --> 11:01.952
Okay, I had enough
with Jax's

11:02.036 --> 11:03.996
little freak out
from this afternoon.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.831
- Hey! That coin toss
was rigged.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.583
I should have been
the one to take Emma home.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.336
Daniel should be here.
What if his mom comes back?

11:10.419 --> 11:12.046
<i>CHRISTINE: Daniel!</i>

11:12.129 --> 11:14.590
<i>Hey, could you open</i>
<i>the door for me, please?</i>

11:14.673 --> 11:16.050
- Oh, man,
you are such a jinx!

11:16.133 --> 11:18.386
- Quick, places!

11:27.019 --> 11:28.521
CHRISTINE: Thank you, Andi.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.107
I made you some lemonade.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.151
- And pizza?
- Oh.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.737
No, I'm sorry, just lemonade.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.447
I thought
you brought snacks.

11:39.615 --> 11:43.285
- I did, but they...
consumed them already.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.704
- Oh. Well,
if you're still hungry,

11:45.788 --> 11:47.581
I could get some
snacks going.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.960
- Mm, that would be wonderful,
thank you.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.462
Now, back to dark matter.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.923
- But, where's Daniel?
BOTH: Uh...

11:56.006 --> 11:57.133
- He went to go get a sweater.
- He went to the bathroom.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.469
- Oh, no, he didn't.
I would have seen him.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.887
(footsteps approaching)

12:01.971 --> 12:05.683
- Nobody moves until I get
my necklace back!

12:08.727 --> 12:11.147
- You heard me!
Where's my necklace?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.315
I want my crystal...

12:13.399 --> 12:15.443
back.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.902
- Hey, guys!
Mia's on her way,

12:16.986 --> 12:17.903
she's really mad--

12:17.987 --> 12:20.281
Oh! Hey, Miss Miller.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.992
And Mia.
Hi.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.787
- Would someone please explain
to me what is going on

12:26.871 --> 12:29.498
before I call
all of your parents.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.460
- Uh... jeez, Mia.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.462
I mean, why'd you
lend me your necklace

12:34.545 --> 12:36.464
if you were gonna
freak out about it?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.883
- What?
- Yeah, look...

12:38.966 --> 12:40.217
I dropped the crystal,
okay?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.052
But it's in here somewhere,

12:42.136 --> 12:46.265
and as soon as we're done
with our, ahem, physics,

12:46.348 --> 12:48.350
and...

12:48.434 --> 12:52.021
nutrit-- nutrition homework,
we'll look for it

12:52.104 --> 12:53.606
and give it back to you.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.151
- Mia, study.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.319
- Yeah.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.403
- Whoa.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.864
- Did you bring
your textbook?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.492
- Y-y-you can use mine.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.535
- Uh, don't worry,
Mrs. M, you know,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.037
Daniel just went
to take Emma home

13:08.120 --> 13:09.497
'cause she wasn't
feeling good.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.540
- No, but Jax said--
- Yeah, yeah. You know what?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.750
Jax is just a little
jealous, okay?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.711
Between us, I think
he likes Emma.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.713
- Oh, yeah.
That-- that's obvious.

13:17.796 --> 13:18.797
Even a T3--

13:18.881 --> 13:20.049
- Hey, it's not
like that!

13:20.132 --> 13:21.467
- Hey, you know,
I told Daniel to come back

13:21.550 --> 13:22.885
as soon as he gets here.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.720
And, uh, if you want
to call my dad, go ahead.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.056
I mean, he--
he's in surgery,

13:27.139 --> 13:28.432
but he always answers
during aneurism repairs.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.600
- No-- he does?
- Yeah.

13:29.683 --> 13:33.062
- But-- uh-- uh--
- Okay!

13:33.145 --> 13:34.438
Good save.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.565
- Without my powers,
I didn't know what to say.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.984
- Me, either. I kept saying
spells in my head,

13:39.068 --> 13:40.277
but nothing!

13:40.361 --> 13:41.987
I don't know how
you humans do it.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.406
Oh, and good job, Mia,
on looking clueless.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.908
- This is fun.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.243
DIEGO: That was a close one.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.995
Oh, is this lemonade?
Sweet!

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
- We need to go get Daniel.
- Stop!

13:51.997 --> 13:55.251
Nobody leaves until
I get my crystal back.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.002
And just to make
it clear,

13:57.086 --> 13:59.421
I don't care who
finds out about us.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.923
It's too late, anyway.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.052
- (sighing)

14:07.179 --> 14:09.598
I should have
held on tighter to Aggie.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.350
I hope the kids
are okay.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.521
- Uh, Nurse Lily, hi.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.731
- Gigi, isn't school closed?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.275
- Principal Alonso
gave me permission

14:19.358 --> 14:21.193
to do my podcast
from Studio "A."

14:21.277 --> 14:22.278
- The janitor's closet.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.780
- Also known as Studio "A."

14:24.863 --> 14:26.115
I'm looking
for my memory card.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.783
It's about... this big.
I-- I think--

14:27.866 --> 14:29.952
- Is it this one?
- Yes!

14:30.035 --> 14:30.953
LILY: Here you go.
- Thank you!

14:31.036 --> 14:31.912
LILY: You're welcome.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.250
- After this, we're gonna
go down in history

14:36.333 --> 14:37.793
as the best
pranksters ever.

14:37.876 --> 14:41.088
- The H2O are gonna
be sorry they messed with us.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.339
- I don't see them.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.257
- You sure?

14:43.340 --> 14:44.800
Their mom said they'd be here.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.010
- They'd better be!

14:46.093 --> 14:48.470
I put together about
a half a mile of piping.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
- Do you think they tricked us?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.973
- Don't panic.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.766
- Wait, that's them!
Hide!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.147
- Hurry up!

14:58.230 --> 14:59.690
- I hope this is not
another fight,

14:59.773 --> 15:01.775
'cause Mia's lightning
makes my hair frizzy.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.526
- It's the static electricity.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.737
- I know that.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.743
- Hello.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.828
- Whoa.
What happened here?

15:12.911 --> 15:16.040
- Eh, a little bit
of everything.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.041
So, what are you guys
doing here?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.627
- Proxy said Mia
left a memory card here.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.462
We need it.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.047
- Small card,
about this big?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.340
MADDIE: Yes.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.508
- I just gave it to Gigi.
She said it was hers.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.968
- No!

15:28.052 --> 15:31.138
We've been trying to get that
memory card back for days!

15:31.221 --> 15:32.973
I gotta tell Proxy.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.434
- Okay, what's a "proxy,"
and what's going on?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.187
- Proxy is a synonym
for Kanay.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.855
KATIE: No, it's not.
The memory card

15:39.938 --> 15:42.066
has all the footage
of Emma and Maddie

15:42.149 --> 15:43.359
casting spells
in the janitor's closet.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.694
- Studio "A"?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.197
- You just gave the biggest
gossip at Iridium High

15:48.280 --> 15:49.323
evidence that witches exist.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.241
Great!

15:54.078 --> 15:56.830
- Here, I made you
some mint tea.

15:57.790 --> 15:57.998
I know how much you like it.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.924
Emma, I'm so sorry
about everything.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.842
- Me, too.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.928
- You and I have been through
so much together.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.096
And I don't want it
to end.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.765
From the first day
we met, remember?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.266
In the principal's
office...

16:17.810 --> 16:20.020
My life has never been--

16:20.104 --> 16:21.772
- The same?

16:21.855 --> 16:22.898
- Better.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.110
(sneezing)

16:27.945 --> 16:29.822
I'm so sorry
I startled you.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.409
You're--
you're Emma, right?

- Daniel, I--

17:29.173 --> 17:31.717
- Em, I know you're exhausted
from helping Phillip.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.677
We don't have to
talk about this right now.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.722
But when this is over,
you have to choose.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.932
It's Jax or me.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.184
[keys jingling]

17:40.267 --> 17:41.685
Oh, no,
your dad's coming.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.231
- Emma, I just had the best
Big Brains meeting--

17:46.315 --> 17:49.318
What's he doing here?
What are you doing here?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.278
- Emma wasn't feeling well,
so I brought her home.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.614
- You're not feeling well?
What's wrong?

17:53.697 --> 17:54.823
- I'm fine, just tired.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.743
- You don't look so good.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.119
Well, I think
you have a fever.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.873
I'd better take
your temperature.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.751
- I should go home.
Check on... things.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.169
- Yeah, that's a great idea,

18:07.252 --> 18:08.962
unless you want more detention.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.090
- But we're not at...
school.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.175
(phone beeping)

18:15.469 --> 18:16.553
- Oh, no.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.013
It's Andi.
Mia's at your house.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.723
She wants
her crystal back.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.850
- I'll take care of it.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.436
- Wait...
I'm coming with you.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.397
- No, you need to rest.
I'll take care of Mia.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.857
- I'm the one she's after.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.651
If I don't go,
she'll come here.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.320
And my dad's here.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.321
- Let's go.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.994
- Emma, I'm gonna call
Dr. Feinstein just to be sa--

18:42.621 --> 18:43.705
Emma?

18:44.998 --> 18:47.042
- Okay, people,
be careful.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.420
This place is rigged
by the T3.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.630
- No talking!

18:52.965 --> 18:53.966
That's what
you're worried about?

18:54.049 --> 18:55.342
Getting some foam on you?

18:55.425 --> 18:57.052
- Don't underestimate
the T3.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.847
They threw fish on Jax,
spaghetti on me,

18:59.930 --> 19:01.765
and chocolate pudding
on Mr. Alonso.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.183
- (chuckling) That's nothing

19:03.267 --> 19:05.394
compared to what I'm gonna do
to you.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.855
- Are you sure about that?
'Cause, I don't know, man,

19:07.938 --> 19:10.107
that-- that fish prank
was pretty gross.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.442
- Will you stop talking
and search?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.072
- Two bottles of nitrogen
and a box of fireworks?

19:17.155 --> 19:18.949
Daniel's siblings
have problems.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.450
- Love fireworks!

19:20.534 --> 19:22.911
- Why does their mom even
let them have this stuff?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.622
What's all this piping for?
And-- and this?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.665
- Wait, don't touch that!

19:27.541 --> 19:28.500
(whirring)
JAX: Oh!

19:30.002 --> 19:33.046
(growling)
(others chuckling)

19:34.715 --> 19:36.967
- What was that?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.135
- Jax got pranked.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.762
- What's up with zombie boy?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.180
He looks different.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.266
- Phillip here to stay.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.727
Phillip--

19:46.810 --> 19:48.478
I-- I am human.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.274
- That's what Emma did?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.026
And you thought I was bad.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.280
Don't even think about it.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.449
- Look, it's not here!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.784
- She's right.
We've looked everywhere.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.620
- I said, keep looking!

20:04.703 --> 20:06.371
- Have you ever stopped
to think that maybe,

20:06.455 --> 20:08.999
the crystal was destroyed
from the spell?

20:09.082 --> 20:10.292
- What?

20:10.375 --> 20:11.960
- It's the biggest spell
you've ever seen, right?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.211
- Yeah, he's right.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.797
I mean, Emma used it
to amplify her powers.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.592
Maybe she used it up
and it disappeared.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.510
- Yeah.
It makes sense.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.262
- No! You're just trying
to confuse me.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.766
They don't have their powers.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.310
That means
the crystal is here.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.269
- Unless...

20:29.853 --> 20:31.813
- Unless what?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.399
- Unless... the exchange
for Phillip

20:34.483 --> 20:36.318
was every witch's powers.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.904
- What?
No!

20:47.037 --> 20:48.830
- Hey, guys.
Thanks for covering for me.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.290
Best little cousins ever.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.708
- Finally, you're here!

20:51.792 --> 20:53.752
We need major help!

20:53.835 --> 20:56.672
- No, you're doing a great job.
Keep it up.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.048
I just have to check
on this memory card.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.257
- No, wait!

20:59.341 --> 21:00.676
- Okay, we're ready to order.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.135
- Oh!

21:05.722 --> 21:06.807
(banging)
-(gasping)

21:06.890 --> 21:08.016
Get me out of here!

21:08.100 --> 21:10.936
This place is...
dark and dank!

21:13.814 --> 21:15.023
- Have you looked behind
that TV?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.734
- No. We were over here,
there's no way it could--

21:17.818 --> 21:20.278
- Keep looking!
(sighing)

21:23.031 --> 21:23.865
- Mia?

21:23.949 --> 21:24.992
- Don't even try it!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.451
DANIEL: What are you doing here?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.412
MIA: I just want my crystal
back, and then I'll leave.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.038
- It's not here!

21:30.122 --> 21:30.372
AGAMEMNON: Oof!

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
Aah!
- Aah!

21:33.041 --> 21:34.584
- It's the Cristal
de Caballero!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.044
EMMA: Jax, get it!

21:36.128 --> 21:37.254
- I got it!

21:37.963 --> 21:41.133
(static beeping)

21:41.216 --> 21:42.676
- Mia?

21:42.759 --> 21:44.720
(static beeping)
- What's happening?

21:44.803 --> 21:46.513
- Let go of the crystal!
Let it go!

21:46.596 --> 21:47.472
- It's mine!

21:47.556 --> 21:48.432
- It's the exchange.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.642
DANIEL: Emma, no!

21:53.895 --> 21:54.479
No!
- Emma!

22:00.819 --> 22:02.571
- Hey!
- Sorry.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.406
- You couldn't land
somewhere else?

22:04.489 --> 22:06.366
- I didn't have
much of a choice.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.702
- Where's my necklace?

22:08.785 --> 22:11.163
- What necklace?

22:11.246 --> 22:12.581
- My crystal!

22:12.664 --> 22:13.749
I can't lose it again!

22:17.919 --> 22:19.129
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.089
- Ha! Like you could.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.384
- You don't need
to protect yourself.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.428
- That's not why I wanted
the crystal back.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.723
- It was...
Never mind.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.976
Do you know
where we are?

22:33.060 --> 22:36.063
- It looks like...
a train station.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.399
- Duh.
(sighing)

22:39.483 --> 22:41.693
- I don't think
we're in Miami anymore.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.778
- Well, I'm going home.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.905
This isn't much of
an even fight.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.281
- Oh-- wait!

22:48.575 --> 22:49.868
That doesn't work on me
the way it does the others.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.953
- Yeah, right.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.583
That's for stealing my crystal.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.542
- And this is for Daniel.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.216
- Well, what happened?
Where'd they go?

23:04.299 --> 23:05.592
- Did you make them
disappear?

23:05.675 --> 23:06.635
- No.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.804
- Mr. Novoa is right.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.222
- About what?
- The exchange.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.682
I told you the world
would balance itself.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.643
- The world can't be
balanced without Emma.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.186
- Ugh.
Really, dude?

23:16.269 --> 23:18.146
- Lay off me!
We have bigger problems

23:18.230 --> 23:19.439
with this exchange thing
you guys keep talking about!

23:21.858 --> 23:23.485
- Emma. Game.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.863
For Phillip.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.032
- He's right!

23:29.116 --> 23:30.659
Quick, do a spell
and get them out!

23:30.742 --> 23:32.911
- I cannot.
<i>We</i> cannot.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.497
We've been exposed to
the crystal for far too long.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.915
We need time
to recharge.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.250
- It'll be
a few hours before

23:38.333 --> 23:40.001
we're up to casting
spells again.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.545
- Well, we have to
do something!

23:41.628 --> 23:43.463
- Andi! Hex!

23:43.547 --> 23:44.923
- Hexy!

23:45.006 --> 23:45.841
Can you get them out
like you got Phillip out?

23:45.924 --> 23:48.135
- Andi!

23:48.218 --> 23:49.344
- He did what?

23:49.427 --> 23:50.720
- Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.013
Now we have books
casting spells?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.974
- What'd he say?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.852
- He said Phillip
was a fluke.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.562
He's gonna need more help
to get them out.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.355
- Well, we'll wait
a couple hours,

24:00.438 --> 24:01.731
and then
we'll get them out.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.191
- A couple hours?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.403
Emma is terrible
at Zombie Apocalypse 3.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.529
She won't make it.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.905
- Wait, what about Maddie?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.949
She hasn't been exposed
to the crystal yet.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.535
- One slice
with pepperoni.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.036
- Where's my smoothie?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.205
- I'd like a ginger ale
and two slices of pizza.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.707
- It's almost ready.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.749
- Is that my pizza?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.042
- Hurry, Hector!

24:23.503 --> 24:24.462
Here ya go!

24:24.546 --> 24:26.006
One smoothie.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.342
- What is that?

24:30.427 --> 24:31.887
- No more blogging.
- Hey!

24:31.970 --> 24:34.264
- We need help!

24:34.347 --> 24:36.016
- The customers
are about to riot!

24:36.099 --> 24:37.851
- You guys can do
high school calculus,

24:37.934 --> 24:40.103
but can't handle
a couple of customers?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.230
Really?
Let's go!

24:42.314 --> 24:43.607
KATIE: There she is!

24:43.690 --> 24:44.357
- You know the drill,
Panthers.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.318
- You'll get a smoothie,

24:46.401 --> 24:47.903
and we look for
the memory card?

24:47.986 --> 24:49.404
- Exactly!
(phone chirping)

24:50.488 --> 24:51.198
It's Proxy from
his emergency phone.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.074
- Is something wrong?

24:53.158 --> 24:54.075
- I need to go.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.827
I trust you to get me
that card!

24:55.911 --> 24:58.038
- You do?

24:58.121 --> 24:59.247
- Of course she does.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
Go see Diego, and don't
worry about a thing.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.337
This is our chance.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.297
You go check the counter
and I'll talk to Gigi.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.674
Finally, we'll be heroes.
(squealing)

25:09.758 --> 25:12.219
- But... I already have
a cape!

25:13.470 --> 25:15.263
- So you want me
to rescue them again?

25:15.347 --> 25:16.556
- Yes.
- Both of them.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.600
- Our focus is on
the Chosen One.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.935
- We're not leaving Mia
in there.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.895
- Yeah, he's right.
We bring them both home.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.897
- Phillip thinks they're at
the train station.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.733
That's where we was before
he got out of the game.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.943
- That's a tough level.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.027
- Zombies.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.738
Many.

25:31.821 --> 25:32.405
Danger!

25:32.489 --> 25:34.658
- He drew a map for us.

25:36.534 --> 25:37.786
- We're gonna have to
send somebody in.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.787
We can set a rendezvous
point in time,

25:38.870 --> 25:40.705
and then Maddie
can pull them out.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.207
- I'll go.
ANDI: No, I'll go!

25:42.290 --> 25:43.333
This is my turf.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.336
- No, I have to go.
I can defend myself.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.629
- So can I.
- You don't have powers.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.714
- Neither do you.
- They're coming back!

25:49.798 --> 25:52.801
- I'm sorry, Daniel,
but Jax is right.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.387
You have to stay here and do
damage control with your mom.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.141
- This is fun.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.185
I feel... lighter here.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.770
- We need to stop.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.397
- Aww, giving up?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.314
- Never.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.649
- I didn't think so!

26:09.776 --> 26:11.695
- Three train cars and a--
ZOMBIE: (groaning)

26:11.778 --> 26:12.821
- Why did you stop?

26:12.904 --> 26:14.239
- (groaning)

26:14.322 --> 26:15.824
- It's the crystal,
isn't it?

26:15.907 --> 26:18.201
- I know where we are.
- (groaning)

26:18.285 --> 26:19.286
- You do?

26:19.369 --> 26:20.996
- Zombie Apocalypse 3!

26:21.079 --> 26:22.289
- The video game?
- Yes!

26:22.372 --> 26:23.415
- (groaning)
MIA: Zombies!

26:23.498 --> 26:24.374
EMMA: Yes, run!

26:24.457 --> 26:27.043
ZOMBIE: (groaning)

26:27.585 --> 26:29.462
EMMA: Hurry!

26:37.304 --> 26:38.930
- Hats?

26:39.014 --> 26:39.597
- It's the best I could do.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.517
- Let's go.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.190
Come on, over there!

26:51.401 --> 26:54.029
- I already told you,

26:54.112 --> 26:56.740
it's my card, my footage,
and my scoop.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.284
- Just wanted to--
- And by the way,

26:59.367 --> 27:00.160
why did Mia have
my memory card?

27:00.243 --> 27:01.202
- Mia, uh--

27:01.286 --> 27:02.704
- Yeah, Mia.

27:02.787 --> 27:06.082
You'd better hope none
of my blogs are missing.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.751
- Gigi!
- I'm busy.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.210
- We need some help.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.338
Some strange girl is tossing
pizzas behind the counter.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.672
- What?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.758
Sophie!
SOPHIE: (giggling)

27:17.177 --> 27:18.428
- Nurse Lily?

27:18.511 --> 27:20.138
Nurse Lily,
what are you doing here?

27:20.221 --> 27:21.639
LILY: I'm getting that footage.
Ha!

27:21.723 --> 27:23.558
No one's exposing
the realm on my watch.

27:23.641 --> 27:26.895
- Us, too!
Twinsies!

27:26.978 --> 27:28.605
- Okay, do you guys know
where Gigi is?

27:28.688 --> 27:30.065
- In the back.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.442
- No, she went over to--
Ow!

27:32.525 --> 27:33.735
KATIE: We'll guard the door.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.324
- Quick, get the computer
before she gets back!

27:39.407 --> 27:41.159
We're gonna be
the heroes this time.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.120
- Got it, Gigi!

27:44.204 --> 27:45.372
GIGI: Hurry!

27:54.422 --> 27:56.424
ZOMBIES: (groaning)

27:56.508 --> 27:58.843
- What are you waiting for?
Jump in!

27:58.927 --> 28:00.220
- I can't!

28:01.221 --> 28:04.099
MIA: Cast a spell
or something.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.058
Don't just sit there!

28:05.141 --> 28:07.685
- I'm too weak!
I can't!

28:07.769 --> 28:07.852
Help me!

28:11.856 --> 28:12.732
Mia?

28:20.782 --> 28:21.449
- Finally!

28:21.533 --> 28:24.202
I beat the Chosen One!

28:33.169 --> 28:35.338
- Emma!

28:37.257 --> 28:37.841
Emma!

28:37.924 --> 28:39.384
ZOMBIES: (groaning)

28:41.719 --> 28:41.761
JAX: Emma!

28:46.933 --> 28:48.184
- It's done, Dad.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.728
We won!

28:50.812 --> 28:51.980
- Mia!

28:55.400 --> 28:57.277
ZOMBIES: (groaning)

29:04.367 --> 29:06.411
MIA: Don't move.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.501
Come on.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.586
They'll be back.

29:14.669 --> 29:15.879
We have to climb aboard.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.391
- (panting)

29:29.601 --> 29:29.934
Thank you.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.022
<i>JAX: Emma!</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:34.939
<i>Mia!</i>

29:35.023 --> 29:38.026
- Oh!
That can't be.

29:38.109 --> 29:38.860
- Is that your weird
wizard friend?

29:49.245 --> 29:51.414
- Jax!

29:56.878 --> 29:57.921
- We don't have much time.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.589
We need to get
out of here soon.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.007
- I still can't believe
you're here.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.219
- (chuckling) I guess I lost
the coin toss, huh?

30:04.302 --> 30:04.886
- We might not get out.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.353
- There's no place
I'd rather be.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.942
Everything I've done
this year,

30:19.025 --> 30:20.401
everything
I've accomplished,

30:20.485 --> 30:22.779
it's all for you.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.365
- You don't have to
prove yourself to me, Jax.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.866
- Only you know the real me.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.079
EMMA: Hi, Dad!

30:31.162 --> 30:32.330
- This is Jax Novoa.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.831
A new student transfer
from, uh...

30:33.915 --> 30:35.083
- Sydney.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.920

31:36.060 --> 31:37.937
- I believe in my heart
that you and I belong together.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.566
But you have to choose.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.067
You can't have both of us.

31:44.944 --> 31:47.905
- I never--
- I know. I know.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.033
But when we get
out of here,

31:50.116 --> 31:52.201
you have to decide,

31:52.285 --> 31:55.872
is it Daniel,
or is it me?

32:03.630 --> 32:04.714
- (clearing throat)

32:06.341 --> 32:07.675
Really?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.135
You're having your
romantic moment now?

32:09.218 --> 32:10.637
- It's none
of your business.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.888
- We were just talking.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.598
- Whatever.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.142
The zombies are gone.
Are you feeling better?

32:16.225 --> 32:17.518
- I am.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.687
- Okay, well, let's go.
We've only got 10 minutes

32:19.771 --> 32:20.897
to get to the clock tower.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.566
- Great.
That gives us enough time.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.068
I have to get
my necklace first.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.403
- Wh-- what?
No. The crystal--

32:27.487 --> 32:29.447
If you're going to
double cross us again--

32:29.530 --> 32:30.698
- It's my dad's.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.284
It's the only thing
I have left.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.204
I'm not leaving
without it.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.473
(clanging)

32:55.556 --> 32:56.974
Be quiet!

33:02.605 --> 33:03.189
(scraping)
Quiet!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.485
- Come on, let's go.
We don't have much time.

33:24.043 --> 33:24.127
Hey!

33:27.004 --> 33:29.298
ZOMBIES: (groaning)
JAX: Hey!

33:30.717 --> 33:33.928
(groaning, snarling)

33:35.346 --> 33:35.930
Go!

33:36.013 --> 33:39.183
ZOMBIES: (groaning)

33:39.726 --> 33:42.186
(Jax grunting)

33:54.615 --> 33:57.160
(kids laughing)

34:02.874 --> 34:05.293
(kids laughing)

34:06.961 --> 34:09.964
ALL: (screaming)

34:10.047 --> 34:11.882
GIGI: I-- Oh!

34:11.966 --> 34:13.134
(whimpering)
Oh, my God.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.648
ALL:(panting)

34:31.860 --> 34:32.110
JAX: Go on!

34:34.864 --> 34:35.907
Go, go!

34:47.585 --> 34:48.628
(grunting)

34:48.710 --> 34:51.339
Stand behind me!

34:51.422 --> 34:53.424
(groaning, snarling)

34:53.507 --> 34:55.259
You too, Mia.
- Uh, I--

34:56.636 --> 34:58.638
- Get ready.

35:01.265 --> 35:05.186
ZOMBIES: (groaning)

35:08.105 --> 35:09.148
- It worked!

35:09.232 --> 35:11.234
- Emma! I'm so happy
to see you.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.781
- How?

35:16.864 --> 35:19.242
- Ha! It was all me.
I saved you.

35:21.118 --> 35:21.953
Again.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.287
- It was a group effort.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.540
- We're going to have to
keep our eye on you.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.792
- Thank you!

35:29.836 --> 35:31.420
- I told you witches
are good people.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.840
- Did he just
call us... people?

35:33.923 --> 35:35.091
- (groaning)

35:36.259 --> 35:37.802
- (sighing)
Thanks for bringing her back.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.432
- Now, where's the crystal?
- It's--

35:43.516 --> 35:46.102
- We lost it
in the train station.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.353
- You lost it?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.565
- Yes. Mia dropped it
when we landed,

35:50.648 --> 35:53.234
and we were too busy trying
to stay alive to get it back.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.820
- So, it's lost
in the game, hmm?

35:55.903 --> 35:56.904
Perfect.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.740
- Thank you.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.285
I couldn't have survived
without you.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.619
- Me, neither.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.161
- See you at school?

36:07.248 --> 36:10.209
- Wait, you're just gonna
let her go, like that?

36:10.293 --> 36:12.420
- We will deal
with her later.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.172
- No, you won't.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.218
- Who would do this?

36:19.302 --> 36:22.597
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.181
- This is so messy.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.017
- I think that was the point.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.184
- We should've
seen this coming.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.604
- Can you guys stop talking
and clean?

36:29.687 --> 36:31.647
My dad's gonna
be here any second.

36:32.773 --> 36:33.941
- I think we need
a new mop.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.153
That one's all gelatin out.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.280
- I can't believe
we didn't see this coming.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.032
It must've taken them about--

36:41.115 --> 36:43.743
- About least two hours
to assemble.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.912
- Impossible!

36:45.995 --> 36:46.662
That's at least
two days work.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.165
- For you maybe.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.625
- This isn't over.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.878
- Hector, is this your backpack?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.130
What do you want?

36:56.213 --> 36:58.049
- We're waiting
for our pizza order.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.091
- We're closed.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.802
- Wow.
How did this happen?

37:01.886 --> 37:05.014
- You know exactly
what happened.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.391
- You know it was them,
you saw them.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.476
- Us? No way.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.062
We're just
waiting for our pizzas.

37:11.145 --> 37:14.106
- That's not true,
this is a setup.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.442
- If they did it,
how come your backpack

37:16.525 --> 37:19.153
has pipes and whatever this is?

37:19.236 --> 37:20.154
- I don't know!

37:20.237 --> 37:22.823
- This sounds like
a family matter.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.700
- Yeah, we better go.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.869
- Later.

37:31.082 --> 37:35.586
- Ding. I get it,
the H2O.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.631
Hector and Oscar.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.800
You're the pranksters.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.093
I'm calling your parents.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.678
- No, wait!

37:46.138 --> 37:47.556
We've been made.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.727
- The T3 think they got us,
but this isn't over.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.606
- We are done fighting Kanays.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.150
Mia's free to go
and do as she pleases.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.360
- Says who?

37:59.443 --> 38:03.197
- I do,
I'm the Chosen One, aren't I?

38:03.280 --> 38:04.615
- Yes, but--

38:04.699 --> 38:07.702
- Well, I'm making decisions
for the realm.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.328
Nobodies going to
bother you, don't worry.

38:13.666 --> 38:14.875
- Well, that's my cue to go.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.420
I think I've been
shocked enough for one day.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.966
- You don't have
to follow me anymore.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.009
You're free.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.719
- What? Really?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.846
- Yes, it's over.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.597
You don't have to
obey me anymore,

38:28.681 --> 38:30.641
at least not until
you lose the next duel.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.518
- (cheers)

38:32.601 --> 38:35.312
I'm free at last,
I'm free at last.

38:37.481 --> 38:38.107
- What are you wearing?

38:38.190 --> 38:40.026
- Oh, it's nothing.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.361
Psh,
this old thing?

38:42.445 --> 38:44.655
Oh, it's just something
the Panthers made me.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.489
Proxy, let's go.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.076
- Oh, wait, Philip should
go with you too.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.454
Check out his new digs.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.415
- You live at home.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.208
Maddie sister.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.212
- This is what I get
for saving you guys?

39:00.296 --> 39:01.422
- Aren't you lucky.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.259
MADDIE: (sighs)

39:05.342 --> 39:07.428
- Come on, Philip,
let's go home buddy.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.474
- Don't forget.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.433
You owe me.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.438
Both of you.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.647
- I know.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.444
- Ha!

39:23.527 --> 39:26.197
Wait 'til she finds out
you promised her mother powers.

39:27.114 --> 39:27.782
- You what?

39:27.865 --> 39:29.075
- Oops.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.661
DESDEMONA: Inconceivable.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.038
- It's not what you think.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.540
- You just can't go around
giving people powers.

39:36.624 --> 39:40.127
- Oh, lay off her
a little, would you?

39:40.211 --> 39:41.462
- Let her explain.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.090
- This has gotten
completely out of hand.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.841
Here.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.885
Put your powers in here

39:47.968 --> 39:49.303
and we will keep them safe

39:49.386 --> 39:50.596
until you're finished
your training.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.808
- It's only temporary,
a preventive measure.

39:54.934 --> 39:55.935
- And if I don't?

39:56.018 --> 39:57.394
- We'll have to rethink
our position

39:57.478 --> 40:01.107
regarding your viability
as the Chosen One.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.738
- No.
I'm not giving up my powers.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.824
- Yeah, you go, Emma!

40:09.907 --> 40:11.242
- Are you defying us?

40:11.325 --> 40:12.243
- After all that has happened,

40:12.326 --> 40:15.079
we rescued you
from that game.

40:15.162 --> 40:17.832
- Uh, technically,
I rescued her.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.166
- Technically,
Maddie and the Hex

40:19.250 --> 40:20.417
rescued all of you.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.545
- The Council is here
to guide you

40:22.628 --> 40:23.546
and help you realize
your potential.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.798
- I know,
and I appreciate that.

40:25.881 --> 40:29.844
But you can't guide me
if you don't trust me.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.762
You have to trust me
to do the right thing.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.806
- Oh, it's not that simple.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.182
Look at all
that's happened.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.768
Freezing time, zombies.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.563
We were almost
exposed to the world.

40:40.646 --> 40:41.897
- But we weren't.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.900
I'm not trying to give you
a hard time

40:44.984 --> 40:46.527
or be disrespectful.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.362
But it's time things change.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.781
What's the point
of having powers

40:50.865 --> 40:52.449
if you can't help people?

40:53.742 --> 40:58.080
You have to trust me,
we have to trust each other.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.540
Things are about
to change in the realm

40:59.623 --> 41:01.083
and I hope you change with them.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.960
- This is outrageous.

41:03.043 --> 41:07.923
- Good, because from now on,
humans, Kanays, witches,

41:08.007 --> 41:10.426
and whatever else there is,

41:10.509 --> 41:12.052
we're all going
to work together.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.222
Starting with you.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.602
- Am I finally getting wings?

41:19.685 --> 41:23.063
- No, but you'll get
a Guardians kit.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.316
- A real one?

41:25.399 --> 41:28.402
Oh, can you make it a belt?
I think it's cooler.

41:28.485 --> 41:31.405
- I'm making Andi
the first human Guardian.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.823
- There's never
been a human Guardian.

41:32.907 --> 41:37.328
- That's why she said
the first human Guardian.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.537
- You deserve it, Andi.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.290
- All right.

41:42.082 --> 41:43.042
We will comply.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.627
- Desdemona.

41:44.710 --> 41:49.256
- Agamemnon,
she's the Chosen One.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.758
We have a sworn duty
to support her.

41:50.841 --> 41:55.387
- I still need you, Agamemnon,
now more than ever.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.264
There's a lot I don't know

41:57.348 --> 41:59.433
and lot of witches out there
to look after.

42:10.069 --> 42:12.905
- I can't believe I did that!

42:12.988 --> 42:14.490
- It's the beginning
of a new era.

42:14.573 --> 42:17.660
- I know, Hexy,
I'll be careful.

42:17.743 --> 42:21.205
I'm just... so happy,
I need to get out of here.

42:21.288 --> 42:23.791
- Go! I have to go to Maddie's
and check up on Philip.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.584
You know, make sure
she didn't Pantherize him

42:25.668 --> 42:26.877
like she did to Diego.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.467
- Come on,
I'll walk you home.

42:33.550 --> 42:36.053
- Let's get out of here,
come on.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.614
