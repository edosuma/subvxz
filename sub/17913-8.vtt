WEBVTT

00:11.680 --> 00:14.040
[sighs] This is a great idea.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.840
It's been ages
since we got drunk before lunch.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.400
- How about The Bull?
- Uh, no, somewhere further away.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.640
- [Luke] What's on the agenda?
- I just need a drink first.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.560
- Did Abigail get back to you?
- No, nothing. This is really weird.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.920
[line ringing]

00:31.120 --> 00:34.080
I think maybe she slipped out
during Angus' big announcement.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.640
Without telling me?

00:37.640 --> 00:39.920
Uh, she's not picking up.
I'm starting to...

00:40.000 --> 00:41.720
[line continues ringing]

00:42.640 --> 00:44.360
Uh, guys, can we just go via her flat?

00:44.440 --> 00:46.520
- It's a ten-minute detour.
- [Luke] Is everything all right?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.880
I don't know.
Last I knew, everything was fine.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.720
Did you guys...
Did you see anything?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.320
- Well...
- What kind of a well was that?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.480
- I don't really know what I saw.
- What did you see?

00:54.560 --> 00:56.960
Well, it was a...
It was a look.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.400
[stutters] A notable look?

00:58.480 --> 01:01.120
Obviously a notable look, Dylan,
or I wouldn't have noticed it.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.640
But not so notable that
I would have brought it up before now.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.200
I would say it was
at the low end of notable.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.600
What did you see?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.560
Well, I arrived at the party...

01:10.640 --> 01:14.880
and I was... I was feeling good,
you know, it was late in the day...

01:15.800 --> 01:18.480
There was a nice vibe to the place.
Lots of familiar faces.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.800
And for a party celebrating a divorce,

01:20.880 --> 01:23.600
I gotta tell you,
I thought it had an upbeat atmosphere.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.080
Some pretty girls, good drinks.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.800
I knew I looked good in my top.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.920
You know, it just... it just...

01:31.000 --> 01:33.280
It felt really right around my shoulders.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
You know how that feels?
When a top just sort of holds you?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.480
Okay, I really don't need to know
how snug your shirt was.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.800
Will you please
just get on with the story? Please.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.320
- Oh! There he is.
- Oh.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.080
Angus. Man of the hour.
All right.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.840
Here is the official proof
that I destroyed my marriage.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.040
On account of my infidelity.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.200
Congratulations.
I think you'll be very happy, mate.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.040
- What, you don't think I'm damaged goods?
- Oh, no, you are. We all are.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.360
I wonder if I look back on today,

01:56.440 --> 01:59.320
if it's the moment that my life
got better or much worse.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.440
I wish I knew which way it was gonna go
and then I'd know how to feel about it.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.440
Me and Evie got this for you.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.040
- Oh.
- [Evie] Don't smoke it all at once.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.480
It's a party. Maybe I'll meet someone.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.560
- [yelling]
- Oh!

02:08.639 --> 02:09.840
[both yelling]

02:10.520 --> 02:11.880
[both laughing]

02:11.960 --> 02:13.960
- First ever divorce party.
- Oh, yeah, mine too.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
Oh, yes.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.520
Huh.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.880
You certainly seem to be
the center of attention.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.080
- How long...
- [door opens]

02:21.760 --> 02:23.160
Did you invite Jane?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.800
- Yeah.
- Dude, why?

02:24.880 --> 02:26.800
It's Jane. Everyone loves Jane.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.240
And she was on the groom's side
of the aisle at the wedding.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.360
The wedding where she dumped Dylan?

02:30.440 --> 02:33.560
Yeah. Ah, but if she hadn't done that,
Dylan wouldn't have met Abigail,

02:33.640 --> 02:35.600
and Abigail makes Dylan happy.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.480
- Have you met Abigail yet?
- No.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.080
You know, she's coming tonight.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.240
Oh, well, um, I'm...
looking forward to meeting her.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.240
- Angus...
- Mmm.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.160
who's the girl in the pink dress?

02:57.520 --> 02:59.080
Oh, that's Nicole.
I work with her.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.440
Uh-huh.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.720
[Dylan] Is this gonna end up as a story
about how you slept with Nicole?

03:07.800 --> 03:08.960
[Luke] No, au contraire,

03:09.040 --> 03:11.320
I spent most of the evening
trying not to sleep with her.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.920
I'm trying to ignore my instincts.
It's, uh, my new thing.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.760
Can you just get to the bit where you saw
Abigail's notable look thing?

03:16.840 --> 03:18.240
Yeah, okay, fine.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.000
Basically it was...
it was a look with a kind of...

03:21.080 --> 03:23.560
searching sadness and regret.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.920
We'd just got back from...
Well, never mind that. Anyway...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.120
the actual look was much later on.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074

03:45.600 --> 03:48.600
Everybody, um,
I've got an announcement to make!

03:48.680 --> 03:51.800
So, um, I thought
I'd say a few words, uh, this evening,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.320
um, but I didn't think
they'd be these words. [Chuckles]

03:54.400 --> 03:57.200
So she was looking at you?
Why... why would she be looking at you?

03:57.800 --> 04:00.160
I don't know.
I didn't even notice her looking at me.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.160
Dude, she was gazing at you.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.280
- Why would she be gazing at you, Evie?
- I don't know!

04:05.360 --> 04:07.800
We had, like,
the most normal conversation.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.840
"Pleased to meet you..."
Dah di dah...

04:11.480 --> 04:14.040
- Oh, Dylan's here!
- Hey!

04:14.120 --> 04:16.040
How you doing? Hey, Mal.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.480
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.279
[Dylan] Hey.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.440
- Abigail. Hi.
- [Mal] I'm Mal.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.080
- Great to see you.
- [Dylan] Hey. There he is.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.560
Hi, I'm Evie. Good to meet you.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.920
Abigail.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.240
Right. [Chuckles]

04:30.320 --> 04:32.040
[Dylan] Uh, drinks?

04:32.120 --> 04:33.360
- I'll go.
- I'll help.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.080
[Dylan] Great.
[Evie] That's it.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.160
We bought some drinks.
We brought them back to you.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.680
Technically, it's your round now.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.800
- Anything else?
- No!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.080
I mean, [sighs] we realized

04:43.160 --> 04:45.120
we'd bumped into each other
at Angus' wedding hotel.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.160
So, that was interesting.
But nothing weird.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.400
That's all.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.680
[chuckles]

04:51.760 --> 04:55.080
- So I'm guessing Dylan is the friend...
- Was!

04:55.160 --> 04:56.760
Was, that's like...

04:56.840 --> 04:59.080
I'm... I'm engaged now to Mal.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.520
I don't know why
I didn't just say we'd met before. I...

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
[chuckles]

05:03.880 --> 05:07.400
- Um, did you and that chef...
- Yeah, no, never again.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.840
Okay. [Chuckles]

05:08.920 --> 05:10.640
After that night,
everyone thought I was a lesbian,

05:10.720 --> 05:14.120
[chuckling] which probably
made my life easier overall.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.000
- They do say that about lesbianism.
- [chuckles]

05:18.080 --> 05:20.240
I did not expect you to be Evie.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.080
Ditto. [Chuckles]

05:23.160 --> 05:24.720
I'm guessing you never did
say anything to him.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.480
Ah, it sort of never came up.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.800
And then things moved on and...

05:28.880 --> 05:30.640
you know, Mal... Mal's great.

05:30.720 --> 05:34.320
You know, I'm really, really happy and...
Dylan is all yours.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.480
I didn't mean it like that.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.680
No, I know, I know, I know.
[chuckles] But he is.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.160
It's... it's all good.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.960
I'm glad it worked out for you.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.040
Okay, sorry to get
all Hercule Poirot on your ass,

05:46.120 --> 05:49.280
but I saw you guys talking and it wasn't
just pleasant chit chat over drinks.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.480
Yes, it was.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.000
Can we find the nearest pub?
I really need that drink now.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.920
[Luke]
I detected a certain intensity, Evie.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.560
Okay, I wasn't gonna dob you in, Poirot,

05:56.640 --> 05:58.680
but if anyone is to blame
for upsetting Abigail last night,

05:58.760 --> 06:00.760
- it's definitely you, mate.
- What's this?

06:00.840 --> 06:02.040
- I don't think...
- [Evie] Yeah, we do.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.360
- I didn't...
- Whatever you did, you did.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.800
Luke, what did you do?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.760
He grabbed her arm
and pulled her back to talk!

06:07.840 --> 06:10.640
In a friendly way. It wasn't a grab,
it was a request with my hands.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
Luke!

06:11.800 --> 06:13.760
I may have glossed over a couple details.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.560
But what matters is,
Abigail and I parted on good terms.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.880
- Just tell me the truth.
- [grunts] I don't want to do that.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.200
- The truth makes me feel real feelings.
- I need to know what happened.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.760
Right, all right, all right.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.200
Abigail and I had a difficult conversation
at one point in the evening, agreed.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.560
Granted, Evie, okay? But it had nothing
to do with Dylan, so it's irrelevant.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.000
- I'd like to be the judge of that.
- Look...

06:35.720 --> 06:38.040
But there's...
There's a context to what happened, Dylan,

06:38.120 --> 06:39.600
and the context itself was important.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.040
So, let's hear the context.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.960
[sighs]

06:48.800 --> 06:50.920
I've been...
I've been seeing a therapist.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.960
You've been dating a therapist?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.200
Not dating. Seeing as in...

06:56.280 --> 06:59.720
paid appointments to talk about
my emotions and so forth.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.240
I think I have issues
with love and sex and relationships.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.680
You're in therapy?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.960
[stutters] You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.280
No, no. No, no, it's fine.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.680
I love you guys.
I just... [inhales sharply]

07:15.760 --> 07:17.760
I've been trying to... [sighs]
break some old habits

07:17.840 --> 07:20.520
and this girl Nicole is
making things very, very difficult for me.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.520
[phone rings]

07:34.480 --> 07:35.680
[Luke] Cleo, I need help.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.520
- I'm being tempted. I need a strategy.
- [Cleo] What's going on?

07:39.080 --> 07:40.560
- Oh, Dylan's here!
- Hey...

07:40.640 --> 07:43.120
I'm being tempted
by hollow, hedonistic sex.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.440
I just... I don't know
whether or not that's a good thing.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.000
Luke, I'm in the middle
of something. Is it urgent?

07:48.080 --> 07:51.080
There's a girl I want to have sex with.
First time in ages, so that's good.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.120
But I'm not sure
I want to be that guy anymore.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.960
You don't have to
sleep with someone straight away.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.440
Yes! Good.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.560
Go slow.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.080
How do I do that?

08:00.160 --> 08:03.160
I don't know. Try being mindful?

08:03.240 --> 08:06.160
Fuck, mindful? You haven't seen this girl.
She's a hall-of-famer.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.440
Okay, so prove to yourself
you can get through the night

08:08.520 --> 08:10.640
without sleeping with her.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.440
Sleep with her next week.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.680
I am gonna find that
very fucking difficult, Cleo.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.200
What might make it easier?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.400
[chuckles]

08:21.480 --> 08:23.400
[Evie] Dude, where is this going?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.400
How do you stop a guy
from wanting a cigarette?

08:25.480 --> 08:26.560
Nicotine patch?

08:26.640 --> 08:29.520
Give him a cigarette.
That's how you stop him wanting one.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.159
Well I... gave myself a cigarette.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.720
Oh, my God.
That is where this is going.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.600
- I don't follow.
- Tell me you're joking!

08:35.679 --> 08:38.679
It was a medical procedure
to avert a major psychological crisis.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.520
That is not
where your consciousness is located.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.280
- Is it not?
- You knocked one out at Angus's party?

08:44.360 --> 08:46.960
To take the edge off my lust for Nicole.
I took no pleasure in it,

08:47.040 --> 08:48.720
other than the obvious pleasure
I took in it.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.480
Why... why does this involve Abigail?

08:50.560 --> 08:52.480
Well, you see,
I kept running into this girl

08:52.560 --> 08:54.000
and she's honestly smoking hot.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.840
So... well... then...

08:56.920 --> 08:57.960
[groans]

08:58.040 --> 08:59.760
Hey! [Chuckles]

09:05.000 --> 09:06.240
Hi.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.560
- Hi.
- Angus talks about you a lot at work.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.600
He's really pinning his hopes on you.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.720
- Hopes?
- Yeah.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
[stutters] Hopes for what?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.760
Getting laid.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.560
He says it's your forte.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.080
What? [Chuckles] What?

09:23.120 --> 09:26.800
I wouldn't say it's a forte, per se.
It's more of a knack, really.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.800
Well, I think if you have a talent,
you ought to share it.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
[chuckles]

09:35.480 --> 09:37.840
You know, actually my biggest talent
is for origami.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.920
Would you like me
to make you a paper swan?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.240
Okay.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.440
Okay, I'll make you
a paper swan, cheers.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.160
[chuckles]

09:50.240 --> 09:53.080
Nicole was [scoffs]
woof and impossibly hot.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.760
- What is wrong with you?
- No, what is right with me.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.640
This was me trying to be a better man.
Look, I didn't plan for any of this.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.640
But the toilet was busy,
and I was desperate.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.720
[sighs]

10:14.720 --> 10:17.080
[indistinct chatter]

10:23.920 --> 10:26.240
This particular spot
was officially out of bounds.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.000
And I genuinely thought I'd be over
and done with in two minutes.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.960
Nobody would have ever had to know.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.800
[Evie] So you're saying
your therapist told you to do this?

10:33.880 --> 10:35.160
[Luke] Effectively, yes.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.360
Not in so many words,
but I read between the lines.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.960
[breathing heavily]

10:40.040 --> 10:41.800
[whispering] Come on, you fucker.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.840
[Luke panting] Yeah, come on.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.120
[Luke gasps]

10:55.680 --> 10:57.200
It's not what it looks like.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
What is it then?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.200
- I don't know.
- Oh, dear God.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.080
- Do you want to talk about this?
- Look, please...

11:04.160 --> 11:05.520
This will need to be talked about!

11:13.160 --> 11:15.120
[indistinct chatter]

11:28.600 --> 11:29.800
[Luke] I know it looked bad,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.680
but she did keep saying
she wasn't upset about me,

11:31.760 --> 11:33.200
and it was about something else.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.000
I don't understand why she wouldn't
pick up the phone to Dylan because of me.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.160
She was holding a cigarette?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.480
Yeah.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.800
Abigail doesn't smoke.
Why was she smoking?

11:40.880 --> 11:41.840
I don't know.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.360
But if she came out for a smoke
because she was upset,

11:44.440 --> 11:47.320
then her being upset
predates her catching me au naturel.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.640
[scoffs] There's nothing natural
about what you were doing.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.200
My point is that I'm off the hook.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.080
Yeah, good job, Luke.
You really come out of this looking good.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.120
I've never seen her smoke.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.600
Look, dude...

11:58.080 --> 11:59.840
it wasn't Evie and it wasn't me.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.800
She's not returning your calls.
Maybe you upset her.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.720
I barely saw her all night.
We had, like, one conversation.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.320
[indistinct chatter]

12:15.640 --> 12:17.280
You all right?
You having a good time?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.480
- Yeah.
- What?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.520
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely. Anything.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.920
Did you and Evie sleep together?

12:31.520 --> 12:32.800
Yeah.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.000
Yeah we did,
um, but it was a long time ago.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.560
- And then never again?
- No.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.080
We're just friends

12:41.160 --> 12:43.760
and we've been just friends
for a very long time.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.960
Did she have to get tested
'cause of that friendship?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.360
No, it was like... seven years ago.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.440
It was before
chlamydia was even invented.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.520
[chuckles] I've met Evie before.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.560
When you were looking
for a wedding venue for Angus.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.480
- I was on the bar that night.
- Were you?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.000
I don't think we met,

12:59.080 --> 13:00.960
'cause I'd have remembered you.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.240
I really liked her.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.800
Anyway, green-eyed paranoia.
It's over and done with.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.520
- I'm sorry for prying.
- Oh, it's okay.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.680
You can ask me anything.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.360
I still don't get
why she was smoking.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.160
Hey, why don't you ask Angus?
He was with her.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.120
Okay, I really want to see her now.
I'm getting worried.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.360
[line ringing]

13:24.760 --> 13:27.400
- [Angus] Dyl.
- Angus, I need you to listen carefully.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.280
Last night you were with Abigail
when you both saw Luke.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.760
Oh, yeah, that's an image
that will stay in my head forever.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.440
Yeah. Angus, were you with Abigail
before you went outside to smoke?

13:36.520 --> 13:39.320
- Yeah, she seemed quite upset.
- Tell me everything you know.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.240
Well, I'd had a bit of a difficult night.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.160
It's cool that you're throwing a party
to celebrate the divorce.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.440
Oh, well, that's me all over.
Fun-loving and now single as well.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.880
- Uh, why did you get divorced?
- Oh, I slept with a stripper.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.640
- Oh!
- [both chuckle]

13:54.360 --> 13:57.960
Yes, I already tried that.
And no, it didn't work. So, what now?

13:58.040 --> 14:01.480
- I don't know! You're the therapist!
- So, can I get you that drink?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.240
Um, I'm just gonna go see my friend.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.720
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- See you later?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.520
Eventually I just thought, "No, Angus,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.960
give up on love and enjoy the company
of some wonderful people."

14:12.040 --> 14:13.280
So, I went to speak to Jane.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.800
Jane!

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
Hey! [Chuckles]

14:22.080 --> 14:23.840
Oh, Abigail, this is Jane.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.160
She was Dylan's date
at mine and Helen's wedding.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.040
Sadly, it wasn't meant to be.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.760
But on the upside,
it was meant to be with Angus's best man.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.720
- [chuckles]
- How is he?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.040
Actually, I was working there
that night.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.160
Dylan let you have the room, didn't he?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.040
Yeah, he's a gentleman like that.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.000
Oh, God, you weren't there the night
we set off the fire alarm, were you?

14:44.080 --> 14:47.480
Me and Dylan were just talking about
how I met Evie that night.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.800
Oh, well,
here we all are together again.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.160
Oh, God, Jane,
it's been too long since we saw you.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.480
Jane, Jane, good old Jane.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.840
Actually, I saw Dylan and Evie
quite recently.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.080
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.960
- Saw her at the clinic.
- Evie was at the clinic?

15:01.040 --> 15:04.480
Pretty sure they had a little wingding
after him and me broke up.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.120
[chuckles] I mean,
it was always on the cards.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.080
Because maybe
she was just waiting for someone?

15:10.160 --> 15:13.280
She was wielding her pot of wee
like a tiny little trophy

15:13.360 --> 15:16.520
and Dylan was looking very anxious
about the whole thing.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.880
[laughs] You don't know
what her results were, do you?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.400
- No.
- Oh, well. It's only chlamydia.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.400
It's probably good for you to get it once.
You know, like, uh, chicken pox.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.840
Has anyone got a cigarette?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.640
- Oh, shit.
- What is it?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.760
I've been waiting to flame up the beast.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.280
I think I know why Abigail's upset.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.640
[Angus] And then,
the most wonderful thing happened.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.200
Holly! You found me!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.720
- Or are you here for someone else?
- No.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.840
I've been looking for you for ages.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.760
- [laughs]
- I'm so happy!

16:01.840 --> 16:03.000
Me too!

16:04.160 --> 16:06.720
God, I'd begun to think
you were some wonderful drunk dream.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.920
I've thought about you
every day for three months.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.400
- Aw.
- Oh, God, can I get you a drink?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.840
Can't. Pregnant.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.680
Oh!

16:17.760 --> 16:19.800
Well, ah, congratulations.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.040
[stutters] Uh, how far along are you?

16:22.120 --> 16:24.080
About three months.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.040
Sorry... three months?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.120
It's yours! [Chuckles]

16:31.160 --> 16:32.360
Oh, my God.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.360
- Oh...
- Yes!

16:36.680 --> 16:37.920
[stutters]

16:39.200 --> 16:40.960
- Really?
- Yes, yes!

16:41.040 --> 16:42.920
- Okay. [Laughing]
- Yes.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.040
Will you guys wait for me?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.800
Of course.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.600
[Luke] Good luck.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.360
[buzzing]

17:48.560 --> 17:50.200
[inaudible]

17:53.400 --> 17:54.440
Where's Mal?

17:54.520 --> 17:58.120
- Rugby's on in the back room.
- Your touchline awaits.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.520
[Evie] Don't.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.800
- How did we get here, Dyl?
- What do you mean?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.400
Well, how do you feel about Abigail?

18:06.480 --> 18:09.320
I mean... really?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.800
Being honest?

18:13.920 --> 18:16.400
Everybody, um,
I've got an announcement to make!

18:16.480 --> 18:20.080
So, I thought
I'd say a few words this evening,

18:20.160 --> 18:22.520
um, but I didn't think
they'd be these words. [Chuckles]

18:22.600 --> 18:24.400
Um, this is Holly.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.760
[mouthing] Hi.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.200
Um, we met at a strip club.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.800
[all cheering]

18:30.880 --> 18:32.600
Um, but afterwards they threw me out.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.040
Um, [stutters]
I went back in the daytime

18:36.120 --> 18:38.280
to find her,
but they threatened to break my nose.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.720
- [all chuckling]
- And then, you know, they fired me.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.640
And I've been looking for Angus ever since

18:42.720 --> 18:45.640
and then he just pops up in a photo
on my friend's Instagram page...

18:45.720 --> 18:48.880
- Divorce party!
- [all cheering]

18:48.960 --> 18:52.440
- Um... we're having a baby!
- Oh, and we're getting married!

18:52.520 --> 18:54.120
- [all exclaiming]
- [Angus] Yeah!

18:54.200 --> 18:55.440
[all cheering]

19:28.640 --> 19:30.040
You know, I want what you have.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.000
You know, I want to be in love again.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.120
Why, what's up?

19:41.600 --> 19:44.320
I really did want a drink
in my hand before I said anything.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.320
- [breathes heavily]
- What's going on?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.320
- You all right?
- Fine.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.960
Only, I was talking to Jane

20:12.040 --> 20:14.600
and she mentioned you being
at the STI clinic with Dylan,

20:14.680 --> 20:16.800
- and I sort of put two and two together.
- [chuckles]

20:17.720 --> 20:19.480
- I made a mistake.
- Oh, so did I.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.560
[both chuckle]

20:20.640 --> 20:22.000
Does he know?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.520
- Mal doesn't know.
- Oh, I won't say anything.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.880
[chuckles]

20:27.960 --> 20:31.000
Actually, with me,
I don't think I did make a mistake.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.680
And I'm not proud of cheating,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.320
but I think
I made the bigger mistake long ago.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.800
Everything after that
was just the consequences.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.960
- Did you know that at the time?
- On some level I think I did.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.280
What did it feel like?

20:43.360 --> 20:47.400
Uh, look, I tried to kiss you
on my wedding day.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.000
[both chuckle]

20:49.080 --> 20:51.480
- I mean, there were warning signs.
- Yeah.

20:51.560 --> 20:56.480
There was just this... ache
for a different life that never went away.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.640
And I thought
marriage would fix it.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.960
Doesn't it?

21:01.440 --> 21:06.040
I think, on some level, Helen knew
I didn't love her as much as she loved me.

21:07.320 --> 21:11.360
And she just became
permanently angry with me because of it.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.720
Angus, I am so full of doubts.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.000
I keep thinking it's just because it's me.
But what if it's not? [Breathes heavily]

21:21.400 --> 21:23.680
Have you guys seen Abigail?
I can't find her anywhere.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.960
No.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.600
Okay, thanks.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.680
My hard-won advice...

21:33.760 --> 21:35.880
would be not to ignore those feelings.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.960
Yeah. [Sniffles]

21:54.720 --> 21:57.000
I'm gonna need somewhere to live.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.200
[sniffles]

22:05.240 --> 22:08.080
I know why you're not answering my calls
and why you left without me.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.320
Evie and I slept together
about a year ago.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.040
I lied to you about that.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.760
I didn't lie because
there's anything going on between us.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.440
I lied because... I'm ashamed of it.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.000
And because I didn't want you thinking

22:20.080 --> 22:22.840
that I'm the kind of person
who does things like that.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.600
Who shags someone's girlfriend?

22:25.680 --> 22:27.040
But that is what you did.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.680
I don't mind complicated.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.960
I can handle
the occasional failure in character...

22:34.080 --> 22:36.040
but I do not like being lied to.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.480
[Luke] How was Mal?

22:40.520 --> 22:41.600
Bad.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.560
Really bad.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.400
I just couldn't not say anything.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.280
I just would have always
had this thought eating away at me.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
How do you feel?

22:55.640 --> 22:57.360
Be honest or I'll kick you out.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.800
I love you.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.640
And I'm trying
not to say that lightly anymore.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.480
- How about you?
- Annoyed at you.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.520
I'm worried.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.840
I'm really happy
when you say that you love me...

23:13.720 --> 23:15.280
because I do love you back.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.040
And I'm annoyed about that
on top of everything.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.880
You don't mess this up.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.360
Is any of this about Dylan?

23:39.600 --> 23:41.520
Of course
it's about Dylan. [Chuckles softly]
