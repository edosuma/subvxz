WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:07.408
- DEB, LOOK AT THIS.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.110
I WAS WORKING OUT,
I WAS DOING SOME POWER CRUNCHES,

00:09.143 --> 00:11.479
AND I FOUND THIS LUMP HERE.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.481
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.249
THIS IS SOMETHING.
THIS IS SOMETHING HERE.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.753
THIS IS NOT--
OH, I GOT ANOTHER ONE.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.193
OH, IT'S A SET.
THAT'S OKAY; I'M ALL RIGHT.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.129
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.064
- [sighs]
FREAK.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.700
- HI, I'M RAY.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.268
I LIVE HEREIN LONG ISLAND

00:34.302 --> 00:36.737
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA;

00:36.770 --> 00:38.272
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER;

00:38.306 --> 00:49.183
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.552
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.454
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.189
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

00:59.193 --> 01:11.839
AND DONE.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.641
- ABOUT THANKSGIVING.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.775
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.844
- WELL, I WAS THINKING,
AREN'T YOU TIRED

01:16.877 --> 01:18.612
OF GOING TO OUR PARENTS' HOUSES
EVERY YEAR?

01:18.646 --> 01:21.715
- YEAH. YEAH.
THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.352
WE GO UNDERGROUND THIS YEAR.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.288
- HERE.
HOLD THIS.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.423
I WAS THINKING THAT INSTEAD OF
ALTERNATING

01:29.457 --> 01:30.558
BETWEEN THEIR HOUSES,

01:30.591 --> 01:31.759
WE COULD JUST
HAVE THANKSGIVING HERE.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.427
- NO. HERE? NO. NO.
- WHY?

01:33.461 --> 01:35.463
- WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.
COME ON.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.897
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS
SOME PEOPLE,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.433
BUT YOU'LL MAKE A LOT OF FRIENDS
WHEN YOU'RE BLONDE.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.902
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE A FAMILY,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.572
AND I KIND OF WANT TO HAVE
OUR OWN TRADITION, YOU KNOW?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.274
WHEN THE KIDS REMEMBER
THANKSGIVING,

01:46.307 --> 01:47.741
I WANT THEM TO THINK
OF OUR CELEBRATION.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.577
- YEAH, BUT IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AT MY MOM'S THIS YEAR.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.145
- YEAH?

01:51.179 --> 01:53.381
- SHE DOESN'T
HANDLE CHANGE WELL, HUH?

01:53.414 --> 01:56.850
REMEMBER THE GREAT
MICROWAVE WARS OF '93?

01:56.884 --> 01:59.153
- SHE SURVIVED THEM.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.721
THEY'LL JUST COME OVER HERE.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.692
- YEAH, BUT MY MOM--
MY MOM'S SUCH A GREAT COOK.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.395
THANKSGIVING, THAT'S WHAT
KIND OF MAKES MY MOM

02:07.428 --> 02:09.197
WORTH IT.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.268
- YOU SAYING
I'M NOT A GREAT COOK?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.536
- NO!

02:15.569 --> 02:18.172
BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS WORTH IT.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.240
SEE, THAT'S CALLED
A QUICK SAVE RIGHT THERE.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.275
- YEAH.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.810
- COME ON, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
ALL THAT--

02:22.843 --> 02:25.613
ALL THAT COOKING AND
THE SHOPPING AND THE CLEANING.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.582
- OH, YEAH, WHAT A CHANGE
OF PACE THAT WOULD BE.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.718
[knocking at door]

02:32.253 --> 02:34.288
- SMELL YOUR FATHER.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.956
- WHAT?
- WOULD YOU STOP?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.858
- SMELL YOUR FATHER.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.862
WHAT DOES HE SMELL LIKE?

02:41.895 --> 02:43.297
- A SUMMER BREEZE?

02:43.331 --> 02:44.632
- OH!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.500
MOTHBALLS.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.336
HE PULLED THIS OLD JACKET
OUT OF THE ATTIC

02:48.369 --> 02:50.338
WITHOUT TAKING IT
TO THE CLEANERS FIRST.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.939
OOH, THAT SMELL
MAKES ME SICK.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.741
- OH, RELAX.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.243
IF MOTHBALLS
WERE BAD FOR PEOPLE,

02:55.276 --> 02:57.611
THEY'D CALL THEM PEOPLEBALLS.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.949
- OH, DEBRA, HOW NICE.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.685
YOU'RE GIVING SEWING
ANOTHER TRY.

03:04.718 --> 03:08.456
- THIS IS ALLY'S THANKSGIVING
COSTUME FOR SCHOOL.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.790
- MY DAUGHTER IS A YAM.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.525
- OH!

03:11.559 --> 03:12.893
MAYBE SHE'LL PUT ON
A LITTLE SHOW FOR US

03:12.926 --> 03:14.795
AFTER OUR THANKSGIVING DINNER.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.230
- OH, WELL, LISTEN,

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
NOW THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED IT,
MARIE,

03:17.765 --> 03:19.600
I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE WE COULD

03:19.633 --> 03:21.669
HAVE THANKSGIVING HERE
THIS YEAR.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.971
- THAT'S SILLY.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.006
I MEAN, WHY GO
TO ALL THAT TROUBLE?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.576
- IT IS KIND OF SILLY.
- RAY.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.745
- LISTEN, MA, DEBRA WANTS
TO TRY IT THIS YEAR,

03:31.779 --> 03:33.614
AND I DO TOO, SINCE

03:33.647 --> 03:36.917
I SLEEP OVER HERE NOW.

03:36.950 --> 03:41.389
- YEAH, BUT--BUT YOU SPENT
LAST YEAR AT DEBRA'S PARENTS'.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.923
- WELL, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD DO IT HERE THIS YEAR,

03:42.956 --> 03:44.625
AND THEN NEXT YEAR
YOU COULD DO IT,

03:44.658 --> 03:46.294
AND THEN MY PARENTS.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.729
I KIND OF WANT
TO JUST START MY OWN TRADITION.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.631
- OH, THAT'S FINE.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.032
THAT'S JUST FINE.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.301
[chuckles]

03:53.334 --> 03:54.502
I WAS JUST WONDERING

03:54.535 --> 03:56.937
WHY YOU'RE PULLING
THAT BALONEY ON MY YEAR.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.772
- MA, DEBRA'S JUST TRYING

03:58.806 --> 04:00.574
TO GET INTO THE ROTATION;
THAT'S ALL.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.743
- THIS IS OUR YEAR.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.612
FRANK, SAY SOMETHING.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.481
- WHO CARES?

04:07.515 --> 04:09.883
JUST SO LONG AS I GET
MY FAVORITE PIECE OF THE TURKEY,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.786
THE LAST PART
OVER THE FENCE,

04:12.820 --> 04:13.987
THE CABOOSE.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.659
- WELL, FRANK,
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.595
YOU CAN EITHER HAVE IT HERE
OR AT HOME WITH ME,

04:21.629 --> 04:24.765
WHERE I WILL BE PREPARING
MY USUAL THANKSGIVING FEAST.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.934
- OH, F-FEAST.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.302
- YOU HEARD ME.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.638
- AW.
SHE'S MAKING A FEAST.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.942
- WELL, I COULD EAT HERE
AND THERE.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.011
THEN I'D GET TWO CABOOSES.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.484
- HONEY, HOW BIG
IS A BIG TURKEY?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.686
- ABOUT 18 POUNDS.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.689
- 18 POUNDS.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.758
OH, I THINK THIS ONE
IS JUST ENOUGH.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.793
- PUT HIM DOWN.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.331
- OOH.
THIS ONE IS SELF-BASTING.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.836
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS WILL BE
A GOOD THANKSGIVING, HUH,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.538
JUST US AND THE KIDS.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.807
YOU COOK,
AND I'LL WATCH FOOTBALL

05:06.840 --> 05:09.643
WITH MY PANTS OPEN ALL DAY.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.413
- YOU KNOW, MY DAD DOESN'T
REALLY LIKE FOOTBALL, RAY.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.349
- YOUR PARENTS ARE COMING?
- YEAH.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.084
AND THEY'RE REALLY HAPPY
WE'RE HAVING THANKSGIVING HERE.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.353
- OH, WE JUST GOT RID
OF TWO PARENTS.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.954
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING
TWO MORE IN?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.823
- YOUR PARENTS SHOULD REALLY
BE HERE TOO, YOU KNOW?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.992
- AH, JUST--THAT MAKES
FOUR PARENTS.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.694
YOU'RE GOING BACKWARDS.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.496
- COME ON, RAY.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.897
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
A REAL THANKSGIVING

05:29.930 --> 05:31.765
UNLESS THE WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.901
IT WOULD BE LIKE WHEN THE
RUSSIANS BOYCOTTED THE OLYMPICS.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.003
YOU KNOW, IT DIMINISHED
THE WHOLE EVENT.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.539
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE FORGETTING
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.541
WHEN THE RUSSIANS
DIDN'T COME,

05:40.574 --> 05:42.610
WE WON EVERYTHING.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
- I REALLY WANT
YOUR PARENTS HERE, RAY.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.114
- WHY? COME ON.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.482
YOU'RE GOING TO HATE IT
IF THEY COME.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.883
THE FIRST THING
MY FATHER'S GOING TO DO

05:49.917 --> 05:51.885
IS GRAB YOUR TURKEY'S BUTT,
HUH?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.721
THAT'S NOT PRETTY.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.022
- WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN,

05:55.055 --> 05:58.058
BECAUSE THIS YEAR,
INSTEAD OF TURKEY, I WAS--

05:58.091 --> 05:59.593
- WHOA, HO, HO.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.861
WHOA.
WAIT, I'M SORRY.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.731
DID YOU SAY
"INSTEAD OF TURKEY"?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.866
- YEAH, I WAS THINKING
I WOULD COOK UP

06:05.899 --> 06:08.836
THIS NICE, BIG, FRESH FISH.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.548
- FISH.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.550
- YEAH, FISH.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.684
- FISH...

06:23.717 --> 06:26.186
ON THANKSGIVING.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.489
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
BETTER FOR YOU, YOU KNOW?

06:28.522 --> 06:32.059
I WAS GOING TO DO
THIS LOVELY STRIPED BASS.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.827
- YEAH, BUT A STRIPED BASS IS...

06:33.861 --> 06:35.796
A FISH!

06:37.765 --> 06:39.900
- MISS McCARTHY TOLD US
THAT THEY HAD FISH

06:39.933 --> 06:41.735
AT THE FIRST THANKSGIVING.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.203
- SEE?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.506
- WELL, PEOPLE WERE STUPID THEN,
SWEETIE.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.509
COME ON, FISH?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.610
- I MEAN, COME ON.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.978
WE WANT TO START
OUR OWN TRADITION,

06:51.011 --> 06:52.746
AND WE ALL LIKE FISH,

06:52.780 --> 06:55.883
AND ALLY WANTS IT TO BE
LIKE THE FIRST THANKSGIVING.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.018
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE
SOME SMALLPOX TOO, THEN?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.754
COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.123
HOW CAN--YOU WANT ME TO CONVINCE
MY PARENTS TO COME OVER HERE,

07:03.156 --> 07:09.563
AND MY BIG SALES PITCH
IS "MMM, MMM, FISH."

07:09.597 --> 07:11.632
- BUT, SEE, IT MAKES SENSE, RAY,

07:11.665 --> 07:14.167
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
MAKES THIS GREAT TURKEY.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.469
THAT'S HER SPECIALTY.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.538
- RIGHT, AND YOU DO
A GREAT FISH,

07:17.571 --> 07:21.942
BUT NOT ON TURKEY DAY.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.877
PLEASE.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.780
TRY THAT ON A DAY
WHERE THERE'S LESS PRESSURE.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.683
PEARL HARBOR DAY.

07:29.717 --> 07:33.186
YEAH, THERE'S A GOOD HOLIDAY
FOR SURPRISES.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.255
WELL, YOU GOT YOUR WISH.
- OKAY.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.224
- YEAH, WE'RE HAVING
THANKSGIVING HERE,

07:37.257 --> 07:38.959
AND THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.495
- AH, GREAT.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.763
HERE.
- REALLY?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.197
WE'LL SEE.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.067
- WELL, BECAUSE MY MOM NOW SAID

07:47.100 --> 07:48.702
SHE'D BE HAPPY TO COME.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.871
- SO WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER BEING HAPPY?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.540
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.041
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HER YEAR, RIGHT?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.743
THE YEAR
THAT YOU'RE NOW TAKING.

07:55.776 --> 07:56.910
AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE
COMING HERE,

07:56.944 --> 07:58.712
AND SHE NOW KNOWS

07:58.746 --> 08:01.649
THAT THE STAR
OF YOUR SHOW IS A FISH.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.686
THAT MAKES HER VERY HAPPY.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.955
- COME ON;
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.189
THAT YOUR MOTHER'S
LOOKING FORWARD

08:09.222 --> 08:11.659
TO MY DINNER BEING A FLOP?

08:11.692 --> 08:12.960
- I'M NOT SAYING
SHE WANTS IT TO BE A FLOP,

08:12.993 --> 08:14.962
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT IT
TO BE BETTER THAN HERS.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.230
HOW'S THAT GOING TO LOOK
TO AUNT EMMA AND UNCLE MEL?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.733
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.869
EMMA AND MEL ARE COMING HERE?

08:21.902 --> 08:24.638
- YEAH, YEAH, SHE HAD ALREADY
INVITED THEM TO HER HOUSE.

08:24.672 --> 08:28.742
- AND SHE'S HAPPY
MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING

08:28.776 --> 08:31.745
SO THERE'LL BE WITNESSES
WHEN I FAIL.

08:31.779 --> 08:32.946
- THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.281
- OH, MY GOD.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.716
THIS IS A TRAP.
IT'S A--

08:35.749 --> 08:37.585
OH, GOD, EMMA AND MEL.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.987
OH, THAT EMMA'S SO WEIRD,
AND MEL IS MEAN.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.722
- AND WEIRD.
- YEAH.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.223
- LISTEN, HERE'S AN IDEA.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.759
JUST CANCEL THE FISH.
GO WITH THE TURKEY.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.194
THEN EVERYTHING
CAN STILL BE ALL RIGHT.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.563
- I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH YOUR MOTHER'S TURKEY, RAY.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.566
THE WOMAN HAS GIBLETS
IN HER BLOOD.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.101
- WELL, THEN LET'S JUST RUN
RIGHT NOW.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.704
COME ON; ONE CALL TO
THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM,

08:56.737 --> 08:58.305
AND WE'RE STEVE
AND PHYLLIS GOLDENBERG

08:58.338 --> 09:00.641
OF TEMPE, ARIZONA.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.142
- NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.111
I'M GOING TO RISE
TO THE CHALLENGE.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.879
YOUR MOTHER'S GOING TO BE
LOOKING FOR ANY FLAW,

09:05.913 --> 09:07.815
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE--
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE

09:07.848 --> 09:09.082
SHE DOESN'T FIND ONE.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.017
- WE? HO.
- YES, WE.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.351
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.820
- YEAH, BUT--
- NO, NO, NO.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.922
THIS WHOLE HOUSE
HAS TO BE SPOTLESS,

09:14.955 --> 09:16.990
AND THE MEAL HAS TO BE MADE
ENTIRELY FROM SCRATCH.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.293
- SCRATCH?
OH, SCRATCH. SCRATCH!

09:20.327 --> 09:22.262
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE TIME
FOR FOOTBALL.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.964
- THERE IS NO TIME
FOR FOOTBALL.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.365
THIS HAS TO BE
THE PERFECT THANKSGIVING.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.935
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.671
- STUPID PILGRIMS.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.046
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT,

09:39.079 --> 09:42.115
THE LAST BOX
OF BAKING POWDER.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.884
I HAD TO FIGHT TWO OLD LADIES
TO GET IT.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.218
- REALLY?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.820
- NOTHING I'M PROUD OF.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.055
ALL RIGHT,
CAN I WATCH FOOTBALL NOW?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.089
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I NEED YOU HERE.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.824
THIS IS NOT BAKING POWDER.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.993
RAY, THIS IS BAKING SODA.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.795
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S STILL A BAKING THING.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.397
- GREAT. NOW WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE ANY BISCUITS.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.232
I'M SURE YOUR MOM'S GOING
TO TAKE NOTICE OF THAT.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.634
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.836
- LISTEN, JUST CUT
THOSE RADISHES, OKAY?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.905
MAKE THEM
INTO LITTLE ROSES.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.140
- WHO AM I, MERLIN?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.842
COME ON; GIVE ME SOMETHING
A MAN CAN DO.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.844
LET ME SMASH WALNUTS.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.412
[timer dings]
OH, THAT'S THE THIRD QUARTER.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.414
- NO, THAT'S THE APPLE
BROWN BETTY. COME ON.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.916
- I'M GOING TO BE
THE ONLY SPORTSWRITER

10:15.949 --> 10:17.250
WHO DOESN'T GET
TO WATCH THE GAME.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.287
- LISTEN, JUST STIR
THOSE ONIONS, WOULD YOU?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.022
THAT'S TOO FAST!
THAT'S TOO FAST.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.323
YOU'RE CRUSHING THE SKINS!

10:23.356 --> 10:24.658
- AH.
- WHAT? WHAT?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.059
- YOU'RE REMINDING ME
THE COWBOYS

10:26.093 --> 10:27.360
ARE CRUSHING THE 'SKINS
RIGHT NOW.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.829
[timer dings]

10:28.862 --> 10:30.030
- OH, NICE TRY.
COME BACK HERE.

10:30.063 --> 10:30.964
NOW, WAIT,
THAT'S NOT THE CARROTS,

10:30.998 --> 10:31.965
'CAUSE I CHECKED THOSE.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.166
CREAMED ONIONS?
NO.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.401

10:34.434 --> 10:35.635
JELL-O MOLD IS SET.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.872
OH, MY GOD.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.440

10:40.473 --> 10:41.942
- OH, MY GOD, THE SQUASH.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.143
- WHAT?
WHAT SQUASH?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.211

I FORGOT THE SQUASH.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.378
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
SO WHAT?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.014
- SO WHAT?
IT'S THE SQUASH, RAY.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.282
IT'S MY ONLY YELLOW.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.918
WHERE DID I PUT IT?

10:50.951 --> 10:51.852
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

10:51.885 --> 10:52.886
- WELL, THINK, RAY.
COME ON.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.087
- I WASN'T HERE.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.790
I WAS OUT
NOT GETTING BAKING POWDER.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.425
- I NEED THAT SQUASH.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.161
- ARE YOU AS TURNED ON
AS I AM RIGHT NOW?

11:01.194 --> 11:04.397
- RAY, I NEED THE SQUASH.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.465

- RAY!

11:05.498 --> 11:06.867
- ALL RIGHT.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.102
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.904
HERE.
COULD THIS GOOPY THING BE IT?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.740
- OH, YES. [laughs]
- OKAY.

I'M SORRY.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.786
- STOP; YOU'RE REACTING
TO MISSING SQUASH

11:25.819 --> 11:29.322
LIKE THE TIME
WE LEFT ALLY AT THE MALL.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.091
- I THINK I'M JUST
A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.893
- I KNOW.
I SEE THAT.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.427
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.029

JUST RUN A LOAD OF DISHES?

CHANGE GEOFFREY.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.804
YOU--
YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL HERE.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.772
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

BE CAREFUL, ALL RIGHT?

12:00.287 --> 12:03.791
OKAY.
NOW IT'S THANKSGIVING.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.525
THIS IS FOOTBALL.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.328
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T WANT ME
TO WATCH FOOTBALL TODAY.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.197
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

12:10.230 --> 12:14.467
YOU MIGHT SAY, "HEY, DADDY,
THAT'S BEING SNEAKY."

12:14.501 --> 12:16.904
THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD
YOU CAN'T TALK YET.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.075

IT'S EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT
IN ONE SHOW.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.023
SEE, DALLAS IS WINNING.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.858
I WANT WASHINGTON TO WIN.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.492
OR DALLAS CAN WIN

12:39.526 --> 12:41.061
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT BY
MORE THAN SEVEN POINTS,

12:41.094 --> 12:45.465
AND THEN DALLAS
DOESN'T COVER THE SPREAD.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.368
THEN DADDY'S FRIEND BERNIE
OWES DADDY $20.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.939
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
NOW, HOW DID YOU DROP THAT?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.408
YOU SEE, MICHAEL,
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,

12:55.442 --> 12:58.378
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE BALL.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.955
- OKAY, I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.322

THE SQUASH.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.058
- YEAH?
- LOOKS DYNAMITE.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.559
- OH, GOOD.

IS DRAIN THE POTATOES,

13:16.296 --> 13:17.965
FINISH MY RELISH TRAY,

13:17.998 --> 13:18.966
AND GET MY FISH GO--

13:18.999 --> 13:20.367

MICHAEL MIGHT NEED CHANGING.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.217
WHY DON'T YOU CHANGE HIM?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.852
- NO, MICHAEL'S FINE.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.054

TO DO, RAY?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.332
IT'S NOT IN HERE.

LOOK.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.572
HERE IT IS RIGHT HERE.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.481

14:10.984 --> 14:13.186

IN MANY COUNTRIES,
WHEN PEOPLE REFER

15:17.717 --> 15:21.388
TO "FUTBOL,"
THEY ACTUALLY MEAN SOCCER.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.898
YOU KNOW, NOTHING I EVER DO
IS GOOD ENOUGH,

20:31.931 --> 20:33.533
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.934
- WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT WHAT SHE THINKS.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.636
I THINK YOU PULLED IT OFF.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.339
- I DO TOO.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.341
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.575
- MA, WE'RE TALKING.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.411
- I HAD NO BUSINESS

20:44.444 --> 20:46.846
MAKING A TURKEY
ON YOUR THANKSGIVING.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.616
AND YOUR FISH IS WONDERFUL.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.552
I MEAN, WHENEVER I MAKE FISH,
FRANK WON'T EVEN TOUCH IT.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.920
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY THAT, MARIE.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.423
- NO, HONEY, I DO.
NO, I DO.

20:56.456 --> 21:00.793
I, UH--
WELL, YOU KNOW--

21:00.827 --> 21:02.729
WHEN I WANTED TO MAKE
MY FIRST THANKSGIVING

21:02.762 --> 21:04.364
FOR EVERYBODY,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.666
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
WENT OUT OF HER WAY

21:06.699 --> 21:08.401
TO MAKE ME MISERABLE.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.569
- NONNY BARONE?

21:09.602 --> 21:12.439
- OH, YEAH.
SHE WAS A HORRIBLE WOMAN.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.641
I MEAN, VERY PUSHY.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.510
WELL, I GUE--
YOU KNOW, I--

21:17.544 --> 21:19.346
I GUESS I'VE BEEN MAKING YOU
THANKSGIVING DINNER

21:19.379 --> 21:20.880
FOR SO MANY YEARS, I--

21:20.913 --> 21:22.815
I FELT A LITTLE THREATENED.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.717
- OH.
I THREATENED YOU?

21:24.751 --> 21:28.321
- HEY, THERE YOU GO, HONEY.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.791
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE MADE
A BEAUTIFUL THANKSGIVING.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.826
- OH, BOY.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.028
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:36.062 --> 21:39.332
WHY--WHY SHOULD I WORK SO HARD
ANYMORE?

21:39.366 --> 21:40.667
FROM NOW ON,

21:40.700 --> 21:43.503
WE'RE ALL COMING HERE
EVERY THANKSGIVING,

- OH, HONEY.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.749
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.033
- IF YOU NEEDED
ANY MORE PROOF

22:14.066 --> 22:17.404
