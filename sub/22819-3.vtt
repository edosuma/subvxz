WEBVTT

02:32.362 --> 02:34.614
- Ship oars!
- Hold back!

02:37.617 --> 02:38.826
Get ready!

02:40.203 --> 02:41.871
And another!

02:52.090 --> 02:53.716
Our King is returned!

02:53.883 --> 02:55.343
Welcome back, my King!

02:57.887 --> 02:59.472
This is your kingdom?

02:59.556 --> 03:02.225
No.
My kingdom is far greater.

03:02.767 --> 03:05.311
My kingdom reaches
to the far ends of this land.

03:05.395 --> 03:06.813
My kingdom is in here.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.398
I don't like the look of it.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.733
And yet it's your new home!

03:52.525 --> 03:56.821
Our warriors went to England
and exacted revenge

03:56.904 --> 03:59.532
for the death
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

03:59.616 --> 04:02.910
Our Great Army was victorious
everywhere!

04:07.206 --> 04:09.167
Some of the leaders
of the army

04:09.250 --> 04:11.169
decided to remain in England.

04:11.544 --> 04:14.631
Some wanted to pursue
other dreams, like my brother.

04:14.714 --> 04:15.798
But don't worry.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.968
Halfdan went exploring
with Bjorn Ironside,

04:19.052 --> 04:20.511
so what harm can come to him?

04:22.889 --> 04:24.682
You know where my heart lies.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.684
It lies here, with you.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.936
You know I want to make
this town

04:29.020 --> 04:30.897
the capital of Norway.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.649
It has always been my dream!

04:35.693 --> 04:38.196
This woman is Astrid.

04:40.031 --> 04:41.532
She is part of my dream.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.704
Sit.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.715
Get used to it.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.722
Ya!

05:30.081 --> 05:32.792
Slave. Do you know who I am?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.460
Of course.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.462
You are Ivar.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.256
Ivar?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.383
Is that it?

05:40.758 --> 05:43.261
No. Ivar the Boneless.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.891
You don't seem afraid of me.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.060
No.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.274
We are expecting to be
attacked by the Saxons.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.402
They have a large army
outside of these walls.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.738
We must ask the gods for help.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.615
We must offer them
a sacrifice.

06:08.661 --> 06:12.790
Would you be willing to offer
yourself as a sacrifice?

06:15.126 --> 06:17.754
I will do anything
you ask me to do.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.969
Then take off your clothes.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.689
Come closer.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.285
Kiss me.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.182
I... I don't understand.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.395
I know you're a cripple,
Boneless.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.356
But let me tell you something.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.445
Your deformity means that
the gods favor you especially.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.116
I've always known that.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.161
I always look for people
who are born different.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.040
Because that's the true sign.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.628
You are
a very special person.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.298
Nobody else here is like you.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.807
You are destined
for great things.

08:08.990 --> 08:10.449
You are free to go.

08:11.826 --> 08:13.661
Do you not want me to...
No.

08:14.996 --> 08:16.831
No, you don't understand.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.668
You are a free woman now.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.504
Leave.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.446
Move the torches over there!

08:48.529 --> 08:51.073
Keep those barrages burning
on the perimeter!

08:53.618 --> 08:55.286
Your Highness. Your Grace.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.579
What news?

08:56.996 --> 08:59.832
The Northmen have not secured
the Roman walls of the town.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.500
They remain undefended.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.918
That's where we enter.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.420
Yes.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.673
Tomorrow we attack York.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.844
And may God be with us.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.579
Why did you really decide
to come with me?

09:40.790 --> 09:43.000
Why did you go
into the wilderness?

09:43.918 --> 09:45.753
You had something to prove.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.257
So do I.

09:52.802 --> 09:54.470
What do you want to achieve?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.349
My brother loves fame
more than I do.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.476
For me,

10:01.435 --> 10:03.145
I just want to live.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.274
But I want to live with
the greatest intensity.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.612
I want to feel every moment
of my life,

10:12.697 --> 10:14.365
as long as it lasts.

10:17.118 --> 10:19.120
I want to be more than
just alive,

10:20.996 --> 10:22.540
if you understand me.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.833
Oh, I do.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.545
Sindric.

10:29.839 --> 10:31.424
What keeps you awake?

10:31.841 --> 10:33.634
I have been thinking.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.511
Where we are going,

10:35.594 --> 10:38.264
it will be much better
to appear as traders

10:38.347 --> 10:39.557
rather than raiders.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.351
So?

10:42.435 --> 10:44.979
So, you should send
most of your fleet home.

10:45.980 --> 10:49.984
Better to proceed with,
at most, three of your ships.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.821
But I will feel naked.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.782
Better naked than dead.

11:03.289 --> 11:05.666
Men at arms!

11:07.084 --> 11:08.085
Face forward!

11:09.128 --> 11:11.714
<i>Unto Thee, O Lord,
do I lift up my soul.</i>

11:12.173 --> 11:14.258
Let me not be ashamed.

11:14.592 --> 11:17.219
Let not mine enemies
triumph over me.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.348
Let them be ashamed
which transgress
without cause.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.185
Show me Thy way, oh Lord.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.769
Teach me Thy path.

11:26.187 --> 11:27.938
For Thou art the God
of my salvation,

11:28.189 --> 11:31.442
on Thee do I wait
all the day.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.652
Amen.

11:33.903 --> 11:35.779
Amen.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.660
My boys, you have a care
for each other.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.287
And you do your duty.

11:44.038 --> 11:45.539
I am sure we shall.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.374
Come, brother.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.170
Mount up!
Prepare to march!

11:51.921 --> 11:53.339
Prepare to march!

11:55.049 --> 11:56.675
On the colors!

12:40.761 --> 12:42.429
That's him.
Who?

12:42.513 --> 12:45.099
Aethelwulf, King Ecbert's son.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.270
Oh, and he brought
his own sons.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.814
Like lambs to the slaughter.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.526
Hvitserk, let's go.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.751
My King!
Shh, shh.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.136
We divide our forces.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.929
We meet at the cathedral.

13:24.013 --> 13:25.431
And may God be with us.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.974
Follow me.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.008
With me!

14:21.570 --> 14:23.656
Get out! Get out! Move! Move!

14:24.657 --> 14:25.699
Ah!

14:27.785 --> 14:29.620
Alfred! Back!

14:31.664 --> 14:32.748
There's another way.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.832
This way!

14:40.631 --> 14:41.715
Where's another way?

14:41.799 --> 14:42.883
Here!

14:45.886 --> 14:48.055
There's no other way!
We must do this!

14:50.849 --> 14:52.059
Alfred!

14:53.227 --> 14:54.353
Go!

14:58.774 --> 14:59.900
Ah!

15:24.258 --> 15:26.385
Lord, forgive the work
I must do this day.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.970
Come out and fight,
you coward!

17:01.563 --> 17:02.564
Alfred!

17:13.742 --> 17:14.826
Father!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.043
Go!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.712
Where's your brother?
Where's your brother?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.153
Wait!

19:26.208 --> 19:27.417
Charge!

19:59.533 --> 20:00.867
Aethelred!

20:04.413 --> 20:05.580
Son!

21:22.491 --> 21:24.117
Fight for your King!

21:24.743 --> 21:26.495
Fight for your God!

21:31.541 --> 21:33.210
Come on, boy! Move!

21:55.816 --> 21:57.818
Oh, clap your hands,
all ye people.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.821
Shout unto God
with the voice of triumph!

22:02.697 --> 22:04.032
For the Lord most high

22:04.115 --> 22:05.492
is terrible.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.041
God reigneth over the heathen!

22:17.212 --> 22:20.507
Retreat! Retreat!

22:23.760 --> 22:27.264
Retreat! Retreat!

22:51.621 --> 22:54.040
Yeah!

23:06.011 --> 23:09.890
We did well, brothers.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.559
We?
Yes.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.979
I saved your life.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.356
It was all my strategy.

23:23.236 --> 23:26.406
And you know that.
We all did very well, though.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.199
Why...
Why do you argue, huh?

23:28.867 --> 23:31.202
- I'm not arguing.
- Good.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.955
The most important thing
is what we do next.

23:34.039 --> 23:35.957
And isn't that obvious, Ubbe?

23:36.041 --> 23:37.042
Yes.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.378
We have defeated the Saxons.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.881
Let's make good
our claim to the land.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.383
Let's all make peace.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.886
I have no interest in peace.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.556
"Peace" is a dirty word.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.475
More of our people

23:53.558 --> 23:55.060
can cross the water.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.187
We can all farm, huh?

23:57.729 --> 24:00.273
Now, it is time to negotiate.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.903
And that is the wrong advice,
as always, Ubbe.

24:06.947 --> 24:07.948
So, Ivar,

24:08.573 --> 24:10.241
what do you suggest, hmm?

24:10.617 --> 24:11.868
The Saxons lost the battle,

24:11.952 --> 24:13.912
but they have
not yet lost the war.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.123
I would

24:17.707 --> 24:21.294
beware of trying
to negotiate with them.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.605
You.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.402
Where is she?

25:28.069 --> 25:29.404
Why hasn't she come?

25:30.321 --> 25:31.322
She refuses.

26:12.197 --> 26:13.239
<i>Skol!</i>

26:13.323 --> 26:14.699
<i>Skol!</i>

26:14.783 --> 26:15.909
Serve the food!

26:15.992 --> 26:18.495
Everyone is starving! Eat!

26:21.498 --> 26:23.333
<i>Skol!</i>

26:36.096 --> 26:39.349
Hvitserk! Hvitserk!

26:40.183 --> 26:42.352
Not a word! We're leaving!

27:05.542 --> 27:07.877
And that's when
I killed the whale.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.546
Forgive me,
King Harald.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.965
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

27:12.841 --> 27:13.883
But...

27:16.386 --> 27:17.387
Thank you

27:18.012 --> 27:19.222
for the feast.

27:36.531 --> 27:37.740
Move.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.610
Oh, yeah.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.952
You look very beautiful.
Mmm.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.289
Very beautiful.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.895
Ah!

28:49.771 --> 28:51.773
Ah! Ah!

29:00.907 --> 29:03.660
What am I
supposed to say?

29:07.080 --> 29:08.331
Ah!

29:08.831 --> 29:10.667
I have no luck with women.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.378
<i>Skol!</i>

29:13.753 --> 29:16.005
<i>Skol!</i>
Drink!

29:16.714 --> 29:19.425
You need
to clean it. With water.

29:19.509 --> 29:21.260
The wound is great.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.097
There's too much blood.

30:54.395 --> 30:55.396
Hmm.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.028
What do you think?

31:02.111 --> 31:03.571
They said they would
give us their decision

31:03.654 --> 31:05.114
first thing in the morning.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.493
Do not worry.

31:10.453 --> 31:11.621
Hvitserk!

31:13.456 --> 31:15.625
This is the right thing to do.

31:15.708 --> 31:16.793
Hmm?

31:17.210 --> 31:20.254
Welcome back, brothers.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.466
Oh, you look thirsty!

31:23.966 --> 31:26.385
Are you thirsty?

31:28.221 --> 31:31.349
I know you shouldn't say,
"I told you so."

31:31.849 --> 31:34.977
But I told you so.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.068
Ivar, we went...
No, no, no. Let me guess.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.655
You went to the Saxons
and tried to make a deal.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.993
They spoke sweet words to you.

31:51.786 --> 31:54.122
Hmm?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.499
They want to make peace?

32:01.170 --> 32:03.589
Claim the land
that my father gave them.

32:03.673 --> 32:06.342
Ubbe and Hvitserk,

32:06.425 --> 32:09.262
two sons of Ragnar Lothbrok,

32:09.345 --> 32:11.264
are offering
to lay down their arms.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.812
They are very brave warriors.
I saw that today.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.023
We must consider their offer.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.859
My father had no right

32:22.942 --> 32:25.403
to grant them that land.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.488
He was no longer King.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.240
But now you are King,

32:29.782 --> 32:31.200
and you can offer it.

32:34.745 --> 32:35.913
As a man of God,

32:35.997 --> 32:38.166
do you not advocate
peace and mercy?

32:39.917 --> 32:41.252
Yes,

32:41.335 --> 32:43.045
of course,

32:43.129 --> 32:44.463
my Prince.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.395
Good.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.875
But of course you were brave.

34:03.626 --> 34:04.835
You fought back.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.380
You fought back, right?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.883
You didn't let them
get away with that.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.094
Huh?

34:41.539 --> 34:42.832
Tut-tut!

34:58.222 --> 35:00.599
I was just trying...
You made a bad call!

35:03.436 --> 35:05.229
You showed yourself
to be weak.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.108
You two are lucky to be alive.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.528
And now it is finally time

35:14.155 --> 35:15.656
for you to recognize me

35:15.740 --> 35:18.034
as the rightful leader
of the Great Army.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.709
As your older brother...

35:33.758 --> 35:35.134
As your older brother,

35:35.217 --> 35:37.636
I will never,
ever accept that.

35:40.806 --> 35:41.807
Mmm.

35:42.141 --> 35:44.685
In any case, it would be
a dereliction of duty...

35:47.480 --> 35:48.647
And, after all,

35:49.273 --> 35:51.025
doesn't somebody
have to be responsible

35:51.108 --> 35:52.485
for the care of our people?

35:52.568 --> 35:53.986
Hmm, it doesn't seem to me

35:54.070 --> 35:56.989
that you have taken
that good care of them so far.

36:02.495 --> 36:03.871
You cannot...

36:04.830 --> 36:06.165
Ivar.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.502
Ivar.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.671
Ivar!

36:17.676 --> 36:19.095
You cannot continue
to fight in England

36:19.178 --> 36:21.389
without Hvitserk and me.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.726
I think

36:26.727 --> 36:28.854
that you will find
that more of our warriors

36:28.938 --> 36:31.774
and shield-maidens
want to fight with me

36:31.857 --> 36:33.567
than go farm with you two.

36:33.943 --> 36:37.154
Fight, yes.
Right? Right?

36:49.208 --> 36:50.418
Then Hvitserk and I
will go back

36:50.501 --> 36:52.837
to Kattegat tomorrow
with our forces.

36:58.134 --> 36:59.718
If that is your decision.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.443
Our father...

37:15.609 --> 37:17.278
Our father
would have hated you

37:18.195 --> 37:20.364
for sundering
and splitting his family.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.784
I don't think so.

41:27.403 --> 41:28.654
Look at you!

41:30.447 --> 41:33.242
Trying to sneak away
to avoid your shame!

41:34.034 --> 41:37.329
Surely you must be embarrassed
that nobody else is with you!

41:39.248 --> 41:40.749
Now, why is that?

41:40.833 --> 41:42.751
I can't understand it,
can you?

41:48.424 --> 41:49.633
Ubbe,

41:50.092 --> 41:51.593
nobody is with you!

41:53.137 --> 41:55.556
Everyone is with me!

42:01.478 --> 42:02.771
Let's go.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.484
Hvitserk.

43:07.920 --> 43:11.548
You see? Everyone is with me.
