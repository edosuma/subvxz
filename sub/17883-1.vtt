WEBVTT

00:03.228 --> 00:04.807
Greetings and salutations.

00:04.854 --> 00:06.471
So happy to see
you finally came to your senses

00:06.471 --> 00:08.157
and gave us another shot.

00:08.157 --> 00:09.891
Well, we went with
another security company,

00:09.892 --> 00:11.911
and then we got robbed.

00:11.912 --> 00:15.623
Ha. It's touching stories like
that that keep us in business.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.365
Why don't you
come with me this way,

00:17.366 --> 00:19.984
and I'll introduce you
to the Contra club?

00:19.985 --> 00:23.089
Look alive, people!
Mr. Fox is in the house!

00:23.090 --> 00:24.539
First up, we got cash,

00:24.540 --> 00:26.857
our resident gadget geek
and Sci-Fi fantasy freak.

00:26.858 --> 00:28.993
I'm more than meets the eye, baby.

00:28.994 --> 00:32.079
And of course, Melanie,
lock picker and ass kicker.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.892
You lock it, I pop it.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.883
And last but not least,
Cameron price,

00:35.884 --> 00:37.919
our star hacker
and cyber cracker.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.455
If you upload it, I'll...
download it.

00:41.456 --> 00:43.526
Sorry. I didn't know
we were doing catchphrases.

00:43.527 --> 00:47.197
I gotta say, Oz... you've got
a well-oiled machine here.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.729
Top security team
in the business.

00:48.730 --> 00:50.074
And they saved the best
for last.

00:50.075 --> 00:52.049
I'm Veronica,
the sassy receptionist.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.704
I type 14 words a minute.
I know how to e-mail.

00:54.705 --> 00:55.997
I'm up to windows 95.

00:55.998 --> 00:57.054
She's the temp.

00:57.055 --> 00:58.541
Yeah, more like <i>temptress.</i>

00:58.542 --> 01:00.408
That's a peek under our skirts
here at Contra.

01:00.409 --> 01:03.755
You want to see any more, you're
gonna have to put a ring on it.

01:03.756 --> 01:06.730
Thank you very much, sir.
Looking forward to it.

01:06.731 --> 01:08.533
Well, I just landed us
a nice <i>jobski.</i>

01:08.534 --> 01:10.720
- You know what that means.
- You got first round?

01:10.721 --> 01:11.971
I'll allow it.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.572
♪ sweet

01:17.075 --> 01:22.380

01:22.381 --> 01:27.101

01:40.282 --> 01:41.918
What's going on, guys?

01:41.919 --> 01:43.484
A second ago,
you guys were all like,

01:43.485 --> 01:45.922
"we're cool.
We're in 'reservoir dogs'."

01:45.923 --> 01:47.989
Sorry, temp.
It's victory drinks.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.509
Invite only.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.908
And...

01:50.909 --> 01:53.944
I just bumped you up
to the V.I.P. list.

01:53.945 --> 01:55.765
We can take my kia sedona!

01:55.766 --> 01:57.433
Hey!

01:57.434 --> 02:00.812
Why is Oz being so nice
to this crazy lady?

02:00.813 --> 02:03.273
He's definitely up to something.
Well, then again, when isn't he?

02:03.274 --> 02:05.306
No, even for him,
this is an epic fail.

02:05.307 --> 02:07.791
Well, look, I totally get it.
The lady is an inspiration

02:07.792 --> 02:10.627
for the greatest prank
I'm gonna pull in this office.

02:10.628 --> 02:12.129
Oops, forgot my I.D.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.700
Don't want anybody thinking
I'm your kid sister.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.201
Okay, I'm gonna
fire up the minivan.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.453
Hope nobody's allergic to cats.

02:17.454 --> 02:20.248
Prank her, Cash.
Prank her hard.

02:30.607 --> 02:32.760
Hey. You wanted to see me?

02:32.761 --> 02:34.637
Hey! Cam the man.

02:34.638 --> 02:36.921
This is a very,
very big day for you.

02:36.922 --> 02:38.839
Okay.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.227
I would like you...
To take a seat.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.313
But that's
your Captain Kirk chair.

02:43.314 --> 02:45.713
Have a seat, Chekov.

02:49.028 --> 02:51.052
Why do I feel like
you're going to kill me?

02:51.053 --> 02:55.139
No, no. No, no, no.
That's just a vibe I give off.

02:55.140 --> 02:58.943
I'm really a...
A very, very gentle soul.

02:58.944 --> 03:01.779
You've been here
what, a year now?

03:01.780 --> 03:03.864
Would you say that
you're happy, Cam?

03:03.865 --> 03:06.517
Yeah, of course. I mean,
this place is like family.

03:06.518 --> 03:10.020
Yeah. We are like
a little family in this office.

03:10.021 --> 03:13.926
Now we have a...
A new member.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.494
Yeah. Kooky aunt Ronnie.

03:16.495 --> 03:18.412
I want you to take her
under your wing. You know?

03:18.413 --> 03:20.247
Uh, show her the ropes.

03:20.248 --> 03:21.999
Oh, yeah, we're gonna
show her the ropes.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.552
I mean, Cash is planning
something epic.

03:24.553 --> 03:27.204
No, no. Stop right there.
No pranks,

03:27.205 --> 03:29.817
especially after what happened
to the last receptionist.

03:29.818 --> 03:34.155
Hey! All you normal-size people,
help me! I'm shrinking!

03:34.156 --> 03:35.179
Seriously?

03:35.180 --> 03:37.825
Seriously!
No touch-y that temp-y.

03:37.826 --> 03:41.412
Now get out there and welcome
her on into the fold.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.421
We're not
your typical office, you know?

03:43.422 --> 03:46.056
We do high-end security, so...
Yeah.

03:46.057 --> 03:48.492
- Um, you know, we protect museums...
- Mm-hmm.

03:48.493 --> 03:50.894
- Corporations, weird island compounds...
- Wow.

03:50.895 --> 03:52.616
You know, things can get
kind of crazy around here.

03:52.617 --> 03:56.734
Oh, boy. The craziest thing that happened
at my old office was a little

03:56.735 --> 04:00.037
unwanted game of grab-ass
with Harry from accounting.

04:00.038 --> 04:01.766
Oh, my God.
That happened to you?

04:01.767 --> 04:04.709
Oh, no.
That happened <i>by</i> me. Yeah.

04:04.710 --> 04:07.647
Oh, lordy, that man
had a sweet, sweet chassis.

04:07.648 --> 04:13.528
Mm. Whomp. There it is.
Oh. Mm. Yeah.

04:13.529 --> 04:14.969
What is happening?

04:14.970 --> 04:17.188
You know what's happening, Cam?
Is your tour is...

04:17.189 --> 04:19.807
So I'm taking over.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.244
W...

04:21.245 --> 04:25.123
first up, we've got...
This guy...

04:25.124 --> 04:26.313
Mitchell!

04:26.314 --> 04:27.417
Cash!

04:27.418 --> 04:29.933
With the gadgets and the toys

04:29.934 --> 04:31.337
and the quippy one-liners.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.463
I hate your face.

04:32.464 --> 04:33.756
All right, next.

04:33.757 --> 04:36.774
Oh, and there's
little miss hot potato.

04:36.775 --> 04:39.126
Yep, that's Melanie.
She's our lock picker.

04:39.127 --> 04:41.912
Mm. She is <i>fine</i>
like rice wine.

04:41.913 --> 04:44.976
Camby, I have seen
the way you look at her.

04:44.977 --> 04:47.603
Are you guys...

04:47.604 --> 04:48.771
What?

04:52.974 --> 04:55.509
No. No. Stop.

05:00.065 --> 05:01.965
Ple... please stop that.

05:01.966 --> 05:02.983
We're not... we don't...

05:04.736 --> 05:09.125
No. No. We're not "eeky-eeky."
We're just... we're friends.

05:09.126 --> 05:11.642
She was dating this total douche
until he got arrested

05:11.643 --> 05:13.744
- for selling clean urine to airline pilots.
- What?

05:13.745 --> 05:15.112
Yeah, totally could have
made a move,

05:15.113 --> 05:17.331
but the last thing
I wanted to be was a rebound,

05:17.332 --> 05:18.949
so I didn't really...
you know what?

05:18.950 --> 05:20.668
No. I don't know why I'm...

05:20.669 --> 05:22.013
tour's over.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.755
Wait, no, no. We were just
getting to the good stuff.

05:24.756 --> 05:26.841
You got the <i>deets</i>
on all the <i>peeps.</i>

05:26.842 --> 05:29.187
Ooh. Who's that?

05:29.188 --> 05:30.563
That'd be creepy Carol.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.190
She's in charge of H.R.

05:32.191 --> 05:34.275
Oh, that is so cute.
I love nicknames.

05:34.276 --> 05:36.027
Hi, creepy Carol!

05:36.028 --> 05:39.637
N... th... no. That's more of
a not-to-her-face nickname?

05:39.638 --> 05:41.616
Yeah, we avoid her
at all costs.

05:41.617 --> 05:43.659
Every office has one, right?

05:43.660 --> 05:44.859
Yeah.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.977
And now we've got two.

05:48.388 --> 05:49.500
Ohh!

05:49.501 --> 05:52.627
Ohh. Skunked <i>again.</i>

05:52.628 --> 05:55.185
I'm off my game! I mean,
I can't prank the new girl?

05:55.186 --> 05:56.839
This is just un-American.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.717
Oz said...
"No touch-y the temp-y."

05:59.718 --> 06:02.428
It doesn't make sense.
Oz cherishes a good prank.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.078
Well, the whole thing
was strange.

06:04.079 --> 06:06.580
I mean, I sat in his Kirk chair,
he gave me a back rub, and...

06:06.581 --> 06:08.267
We kind of had a moment.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.644
You sat in the Kirk chair?

06:09.645 --> 06:11.118
You think something's
wrong with Oz?

06:11.119 --> 06:14.021
What are you talking about?
I know Oz.

06:14.022 --> 06:16.818
If there was something going on,
I'd... oh, my God!

06:16.819 --> 06:19.927
This is a first. Oz is in
a meeting with creepy Carol?

06:19.928 --> 06:21.239
Alone.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.615
She smells like soup.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.914
Why would he be
meeting with H.R.?

06:23.915 --> 06:25.399
You think somebody's
getting the boot?

06:25.400 --> 06:29.163
Only one way to find out,
but it's not gonna be pleasant.

06:33.517 --> 06:35.109
Mm. That's yummy.

06:35.110 --> 06:37.839
I can't believe I'm here
with you guys... at Funanigan's.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.731
I mean, you're so pretty
and so cool and so black,

06:40.732 --> 06:42.218
and it's happening.

06:42.219 --> 06:46.264
Mm? How come nobody's <i>sipping?</i>

06:46.265 --> 06:47.872
Oh.
Oh, we are.

06:47.873 --> 06:49.684
Mmm.

06:49.685 --> 06:51.125
Mmm.

06:51.126 --> 06:54.438
So, Carol, what was that
big meeting with Oz all about?

06:54.439 --> 06:55.846
- Yeah, who's getting fired? Is it me?
- Mm.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.191
I'm getting fired, aren't I?

06:57.192 --> 06:59.850
Aah!
Ginormous brain freeze!

07:05.132 --> 07:06.390
Uh, no.

07:06.391 --> 07:08.536
Oz would never fire you guys.
You guys know that.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.998
But the company that he wants
to sell Contra to might.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.667
I'm just saying
there's a big meeting tonight.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.784
Don't tell anyone.
It's confidential, okay?

07:16.785 --> 07:18.569
Mm, mm.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.371
Psst.

07:20.372 --> 07:22.675
I'm really drunk.

07:24.108 --> 07:26.877
- Oh, my God.
- You guys, this is my jam.

07:38.774 --> 07:41.970
You really don't think Oz would sell
Contra without talking to us?

07:42.119 --> 07:43.386
I know why he's not talking.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.997
New owners are gonna
clean house, and I'm boned.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.511
A 26-year-old uber-geek
who lives in his ma's garage

07:49.517 --> 07:50.980
doesn't pop on a resume.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.862
Unless 401 Means "I have
400 grand in the bank"...

07:54.072 --> 07:55.293
I'm screwed.

07:55.348 --> 07:57.457
Ohh, are we gossiping?

07:57.504 --> 08:00.778
Ohh, ho ho ho ho.
Dish it out. Mommy's hungry.

08:01.122 --> 08:02.636
Oh. Okay. I get it.

08:02.689 --> 08:04.474
Gotta earn it.
You're absolutely right.

08:04.475 --> 08:05.926
<i>Respeck!</i> Okay.

08:05.927 --> 08:07.678
I'm just gonna
head back to my ball,

08:07.679 --> 08:10.230
do a little desk-ercise,
fire up my core,

08:10.231 --> 08:12.698
get back into my leathers.

08:12.699 --> 08:14.867
I'm coming for you,
office hottie.

08:14.868 --> 08:16.619
Oh, yes.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.288
I'm gonna get her.

08:19.289 --> 08:20.640
There's gotta be
some wiggle room

08:20.641 --> 08:22.776
on this pranking thing.

08:22.777 --> 08:26.671
Hey, Oz. Where you going?
Hmm? Big meeting?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.949
No, no, I, uh...

08:28.950 --> 08:31.285
I've got a hankering
for some dumplings.

08:31.286 --> 08:32.753
I can't decide
if I'm gonna stay local

08:32.754 --> 08:36.054
or head to Beijing
for some mama foo's. Peace.

08:36.056 --> 08:38.099
Are you selling Contra?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.327
Now why on earth
would I do something

08:40.328 --> 08:41.977
as inconceivable as that?

08:41.979 --> 08:43.315
I don't know. All right?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.971
We can't conceive
of half the things you do,

08:44.971 --> 08:47.380
and the other half,
we just don't understand.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.122
Look at me. Am I blinking?

08:50.890 --> 08:53.275
Huh? Any tells?

08:55.526 --> 09:00.948
I don't think so.
I am <i>not</i> selling... Contra.

09:00.949 --> 09:02.206
You got it?

09:02.207 --> 09:06.602
Now if you don't mind,
my shumai awaits.

09:08.353 --> 09:09.790
You saw that, right?

09:09.791 --> 09:11.924
Sweat. Oz never sweats.

09:11.925 --> 09:14.093
I heard he got
his sweat glands removed.

09:14.094 --> 09:15.157
All right, you know what?

09:15.157 --> 09:16.727
We gotta figure out
who Oz is meeting,

09:16.727 --> 09:18.345
and we gotta figure it out <i>now.</i>

09:24.705 --> 09:26.230
Got me?

09:26.231 --> 09:28.475
Kick me in the dumplings.

09:28.476 --> 09:30.776
There's Oz.
I guess his story checks out.

09:32.419 --> 09:35.323
Who's he meeting?
Oh, my God. It's Ronnie.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.883
What is she doing here?

09:36.955 --> 09:38.525
And what the hell
is she driving?

09:38.577 --> 09:41.662
Not a sensible kia 5-passenger
minivan, I'll tell you <i>that!</i>

09:41.663 --> 09:44.206
You don't think her and Oz
are "eeky-eeky," do you?

09:44.207 --> 09:47.084
Well, if they are,
they're very formal.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.753
Who <i>is</i> this woman?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.004
We gotta hurry up. Veronica
will be here any minute.

09:51.004 --> 09:52.402
"Mug half bull."

09:52.507 --> 09:56.453
Little forensics,
C.S.I. Contra,

09:56.454 --> 09:58.571
lifting fingerprints,
and got it.

09:58.572 --> 10:01.758
All right. And scan...

10:02.844 --> 10:05.186
Hacking
the D.M.V. Database now.

10:06.965 --> 10:09.182
Bingo-bango. Got a match.

10:09.183 --> 10:12.302
Looks like Veronica Mann is actually...

10:12.303 --> 10:14.278
"Veronica Mann"?

10:14.279 --> 10:18.258
She's a V.P. Of acquisitions
for a company named "O.C.P."

10:18.259 --> 10:21.619
Acquisitions?
The woman buys up companies?

10:21.620 --> 10:24.330
Why on earth would Oz
ever sell Contra?

10:24.331 --> 10:26.733
Hello? We're talking
about Oz here.

10:26.734 --> 10:29.453
The man is an enigma
wrapped inside of a puzzle

10:29.454 --> 10:32.439
wrapped inside of
an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.965
Well, the good ones.
The first one.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.442
Know what I think?

10:35.443 --> 10:36.960
I think Veronica's going
all "undercover boss,"

10:36.961 --> 10:38.970
trying to figure out
who to keep and who to let go.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.098
Oh, man, I am so <i>fired.</i>

10:42.099 --> 10:46.018
Toys on his desk
and the quippy one-liners.

10:46.019 --> 10:47.353
I hate your face.

10:47.354 --> 10:48.980
Took me, like, an hour
to clean that thing.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.898
Really flared up
my tennis elbow.

10:50.899 --> 10:52.400
Ah!

10:52.401 --> 10:54.568
Why do I have to be
so hilarious all the time?

10:54.569 --> 10:56.530
Look, she doesn't know
we've cracked her real identity.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.740
Let's just... pucker up
and smooch some booty.

10:59.741 --> 11:01.018
Good morning,
good morning, good morning!

11:01.019 --> 11:01.993
Another beautiful day.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.703
Uh, hey!
Hey, girl!

11:03.704 --> 11:05.489
Veronica, what's up?
Hey, y...

11:05.490 --> 11:06.973
do you want some coffee?

11:06.974 --> 11:09.493
'Cause I-I will drive to
the java hut and everything.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.960
My mama's name is Veronica.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.461
I like you.

11:12.462 --> 11:14.414
Okay.

11:14.415 --> 11:17.883
I know
what's happening here, guys.

11:17.884 --> 11:20.987
Am I making office friends?
Is that what's happening here?

11:20.988 --> 11:22.506
Uh, yeah?
Come on.

11:22.863 --> 11:26.543
Oh, my gosh. Uh, can I make you
one of my famous banana breads?

11:27.033 --> 11:29.729
- You kidding me?
- We <i>love</i> banana bread!

11:29.730 --> 11:32.898
Oh, I knew you would.
Hey, what's this doing here?

11:32.899 --> 11:35.435
You know, sometimes
my cat gets in the batter,

11:35.436 --> 11:37.387
but usually it's fine,
so... buddies!

11:37.388 --> 11:39.321
All right.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.810
Excellent performance, kiddies.
What time's your next show?

11:43.811 --> 11:45.695
Cute, but you lied
right to our faces.

11:45.696 --> 11:47.731
I wanted to tell you the truth,

11:47.732 --> 11:49.015
but Ronnie
was right in earshot,

11:49.016 --> 11:50.033
and it was part
of a condition of the sale.

11:50.034 --> 11:51.684
Everything had to
be confidential.

11:51.685 --> 11:53.403
I kept trying to
drop you guys clues.

11:53.404 --> 11:56.338
- What clues?
- Oz don't sweat.

11:56.339 --> 11:57.923
And, Cam, as much as I love ya,

11:57.924 --> 12:00.426
I don't rub dudes' shoulders
just for the heck of it.

12:00.427 --> 12:02.579
Of course.
I mean, this place is like family.

12:02.580 --> 12:03.637
Yeah.

12:03.638 --> 12:06.098
Morse code?
Who uses morse code anymore?

12:06.099 --> 12:08.017
It's very popular
with the Somali pirates.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.553
Okay. Now we know.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.270
Can you please tell us
why you're selling Contra?

12:11.271 --> 12:13.689
Well, what can I say? They made
me an offer I couldn't refuse.

12:13.690 --> 12:15.232
You sold us out for money?

12:15.233 --> 12:17.394
That's usually
how a sale works, Cam,

12:17.395 --> 12:19.229
but look, it's all copacetic.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.847
Just show Ronnie how talented
and wonderful you guys are,

12:20.848 --> 12:22.823
- and we're fine.
- Oh, God, no.

12:22.824 --> 12:24.742
She's gonna
see my talent firsthand.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.119
- Huh?
- I rigged her damn hippity hop.

12:32.876 --> 12:34.227
I told you, no pranks!

12:34.228 --> 12:36.378
I told you, no pranks!
I didn't listen!

12:40.690 --> 12:43.010
Oh, no!

12:52.583 --> 12:54.750
Looks like
the cat's out of the bag.

12:54.751 --> 12:56.502
You no longer have to be
undercover, old Ronnie Brasco.

12:56.503 --> 12:57.650
Hi!

12:57.651 --> 13:00.277
So sorry for
the exploding fitness product.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.446
In my defense,
I didn't know you mattered.

13:02.447 --> 13:05.394
Ronnie here works
for optimal consumer products.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.263
They're rolling up
security companies,

13:07.264 --> 13:09.765
and they've got
their huge, corporate dart

13:09.766 --> 13:12.748
aimed right at the bull's-eye...
our little Contra band. Ha ha.

13:12.749 --> 13:14.270
I may be your new boss.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.627
Questions? Comments? Concerns?

13:16.628 --> 13:17.920
Little hands, shoot.

13:17.921 --> 13:21.244
My doctor says
they're proportional.

13:22.607 --> 13:23.634
N-never mind.

13:23.635 --> 13:25.114
Okay, here's the dealio.

13:25.115 --> 13:27.483
When O.C.P. Buys a company,

13:27.484 --> 13:30.119
they're really buying
its employees,

13:30.120 --> 13:32.935
<i>so</i> now that
you've blown my cover,

13:32.936 --> 13:34.790
I have to get
the information about you

13:34.791 --> 13:38.107
the old-fashioned way...
self-evaluations!

13:38.108 --> 13:41.514
Just define yourselves for me,
would ya?

13:41.515 --> 13:44.183
I want to know about you...
what needs improvement,

13:44.184 --> 13:47.169
who's the weakest link,
who's a total dick...

13:47.170 --> 13:50.077
Okay, so you want us to
throw each other under the bus?

13:50.078 --> 13:52.191
No, Cammy, not under.

13:52.192 --> 13:55.082
Just put 'em near the tires,
and I'll jam it into reverse.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.126
She's giving me a fear boner.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.732
Hello. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

13:59.733 --> 14:02.184
It was a terrible fuss
getting the ball up the stairs,

14:02.185 --> 14:04.758
as I'm sure you can imagine.
Um, does anybody have a tissue?

14:04.759 --> 14:07.373
I'm actually rather
allergic to Humphrey,

14:07.374 --> 14:10.243
- which... I think I've told you that before.
- No.

14:10.244 --> 14:14.196
I... no, I-I'm pretty sure I have,
'cause I get the red eyes and...

14:14.197 --> 14:15.715
Yeah. Isn't she cute?

14:15.716 --> 14:19.190
This is my executive assistant,
Molly Hughes.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.505
She runs Ronnie-land,
also known as Veronica-ville,

14:22.506 --> 14:25.675
so you can just e-mail
those evals to this e-gal.

14:25.676 --> 14:27.310
Oh. Smashing.

14:27.311 --> 14:29.742
That's another thing you haven't
told me about about there.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.452
You are so funny.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.149
Don't you just love
the way she talks?

14:33.150 --> 14:35.651
She's from across the pond.

14:35.652 --> 14:38.667
Just makes everything
sound so adorable.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.127
Ah.
I just want to pick her up

14:40.128 --> 14:41.657
and put her in my pocket.
Okay.

14:41.658 --> 14:44.048
You kids have got
some homework to attend to,

14:44.049 --> 14:45.466
so let's get on that.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.843
Is this gonna explode?
I don't know. Let's find out.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.617
Nice to meet you.

14:51.618 --> 14:52.806
Oh, my God.

14:52.807 --> 14:54.587
I thought "kooky aunt Ronnie"
was just an act.

14:54.588 --> 14:56.956
That's really her personality.

14:56.957 --> 15:00.126
You want <i>her</i> to buy our office?
Her? Are you crazy?

15:00.127 --> 15:01.794
Boop. I'll allow it.

15:01.795 --> 15:04.046
Well, no, I won't.

15:04.047 --> 15:05.414
I'm sorry, but I'm not working

15:05.415 --> 15:08.017
for Ronnie
or her faceless conglomerate.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.685
Well, at the moment,
you work for me,

15:09.686 --> 15:11.617
- so I say clickety clacky, type-y type-y.
- No way.

15:11.618 --> 15:14.307
Being a corporate bitch goes
against everything I stand for.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.664
I'm not evaluating anything.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.144
Cam, wait.

15:18.145 --> 15:20.813
You're forcing me to do
something I don't like to do...

15:20.814 --> 15:23.783
Tell the truth.

15:23.784 --> 15:25.368
I'm broke, Cam.

15:25.814 --> 15:27.903
What are you talking about?
You drive a Maserati.

15:27.904 --> 15:29.872
You fly to China
to get appetizers.

15:29.873 --> 15:31.874
You own a white tiger!

15:31.875 --> 15:33.459
I'm not saying I'm unhappy.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.444
I'm saying I'm broke, and if
this deal doesn't go through,

15:35.445 --> 15:36.912
everybody gets
kicked to the curb,

15:36.913 --> 15:39.615
and <i>that</i> is the thing
that would make me unhappy.

15:39.616 --> 15:41.133
All right,
I'll fill out the form.

15:41.134 --> 15:42.898
Aw, give Oz a hug.

15:42.899 --> 15:44.420
Okay, all right...

15:44.421 --> 15:46.860
Come on. Tell no one.

15:46.861 --> 15:50.059
Oh, Cam, hey. How's this sound
for a self-evaluation?

15:50.060 --> 15:52.828
"Dear O.C.P., suck it."

15:52.829 --> 15:53.846
Wait, what?

15:53.847 --> 15:55.314
No, no, you were right, Cam.

15:55.315 --> 15:58.038
We're not gonna let Oz sell
our office for a quick buck.

15:58.039 --> 16:01.208
I-I really don't think
you should send those to Molly.

16:01.209 --> 16:02.876
Good call.

16:02.877 --> 16:03.939
Boom.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.838
Sent it to Veronica.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.840
You should read what she wrote.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.800
You have a dirty, dirty mouth.

16:09.801 --> 16:11.135
You have no idea
what you've done.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.199
I was just talking with Oz,
and he...

16:20.323 --> 16:22.229
You... you want me
to C.C. You on this?

16:32.954 --> 16:35.617
Okay, cash, Mel, and delete.

16:39.947 --> 16:41.956
Hey there, big guy.
Hey.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.459
Whatcha doing?

16:43.460 --> 16:46.754
Oh, just surfing... porn.
Pornography. I have a problem.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.548
Oh, I love pornography.
Which site?

16:49.549 --> 16:51.842
The... naked... girl... females.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.819
Oh, my gosh. Are you high?

16:53.820 --> 16:55.303
What?
Did you really think

16:55.304 --> 16:57.856
a billion-dollar company
that rolls up security firms

16:57.857 --> 17:01.602
wasn't gonna notice if you
hacked into their V.P.S e-mail?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.370
Okay, wait. Ronnie,
I can explain.

17:03.371 --> 17:05.088
I mean, this is my personal life
you're invading.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.580
- What did you see, Cam?
- I didn't see... I...

17:06.582 --> 17:09.751
Private e-mails? Documents
from my divorce attorney?

17:09.752 --> 17:12.287
Some regrettable photographs

17:12.288 --> 17:14.990
taken during
an <i>emotional low point...</i>

17:14.991 --> 17:17.675
Wait. Stop. I... you're
telling me way more than I saw.

17:17.676 --> 17:18.926
Is there some kind of
problem here, Ronnie?

17:18.928 --> 17:20.212
Oz, I was just trying to help.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.289
So this was <i>your</i> idea, Oswald.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.834
I am a fun gal, very, very
personable, if you will,

17:25.835 --> 17:27.269
but there is a line,

17:27.270 --> 17:29.604
and your frack doesn't know
where the frick it is.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.757
Whoa, whoa,
what are you saying?

17:31.758 --> 17:34.109
I am saying that
your little Contra club

17:34.110 --> 17:37.971
isn't O.C.P. material after all.
The deal is off.

17:47.455 --> 17:49.817
You're kind of giving me
that kill vibe again.

17:53.528 --> 17:54.629
All right.

17:54.630 --> 17:56.581
Beers are on me.

17:56.582 --> 17:59.033
It's the least I could do
for, you know, ruining lives.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.410
It's not your fault, Cam.

18:00.411 --> 18:02.086
Well, it totally 100% is,

18:02.087 --> 18:04.455
but I am the guy who placed you
in this position, so...

18:04.456 --> 18:07.333
To Contra.
It's been a hell of a ride.

18:07.334 --> 18:08.709
Mm.
Mm.

18:08.710 --> 18:11.295
You know what?
Maybe it's not over.

18:11.296 --> 18:14.181
All this time,
Oz has had our backs,

18:14.182 --> 18:17.518
even when we didn't know it,
so maybe it's time we had yours.

18:17.519 --> 18:19.470
Let's just show O.C.P.
We're worth buying.

18:19.471 --> 18:23.024
Sounds impossible...

18:23.025 --> 18:26.185
But I am starting
to like those odds.

18:26.186 --> 18:27.895
Okay. Let's talk Turkey.

18:27.896 --> 18:29.614
Tomorrow at 10:00 A.M.,
old Ronnie Mann

18:29.615 --> 18:31.699
meets with the board
to kibosh the Contra deal.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.417
That means we've only got
a few hours to figure out

18:33.418 --> 18:35.503
how to get in front of
those suits before she does.

18:35.504 --> 18:38.364
They're a billion-dollar company
running military-grade security.

18:38.365 --> 18:40.174
You know what? If Ronnie's
big meeting is set for 10:00,

18:40.175 --> 18:41.626
let's set our own for 9:00.

18:41.627 --> 18:43.844
Hey. Don't get yourself
lassoed again, cowboy.

18:43.845 --> 18:45.863
Don't worry. This time,
I'm behind seven proxies.

18:45.864 --> 18:47.381
Molly's computer
won't know what hit it.

18:47.382 --> 18:48.799
I'm overriding
her calendar settings.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.626
Got no idea what you just said.

18:50.627 --> 18:52.853
<i>Melanie, you're in charge
of getting us in the door.</i>

18:54.940 --> 18:57.338
<i>First floor's tricked out
with palm recognition scanne.</i>

18:57.339 --> 18:58.392
<i>That's all cash.</i>

18:58.393 --> 18:59.635
All right. Security guard is

18:59.636 --> 19:02.563
a clippers season ticket holder.
Say exactly what I say.

19:03.071 --> 19:05.183
Okay. Mikey d.
Clippers, right? Blake Griffin!

19:05.184 --> 19:08.144
Blake Gryffindor!
Harry Potter, y'all!

19:08.145 --> 19:09.422
Don't geek it up.

19:09.423 --> 19:11.397
I think I got his prints.
Let's see if this works.

19:14.609 --> 19:16.319
We are in.

19:18.253 --> 19:19.964
Ronnie!

19:19.965 --> 19:22.616
There she is. Hey.

19:22.617 --> 19:23.801
Ha ha. <i>Wow.</i>

19:23.802 --> 19:26.971
Kid. Fantastic.

19:26.972 --> 19:29.924
You've done it again.
Brilliant presentation.

19:29.925 --> 19:33.177
Just refresh...
My memory as to why that is.

19:33.178 --> 19:35.796
Having them break into O.C.P...

19:35.797 --> 19:38.007
It's all coming back to me now.

19:38.008 --> 19:41.635
To show us the flaws in our own
"unbreakable" security.

19:41.636 --> 19:44.889
"Unbreakable."
Well, sir, let me just say,

19:44.890 --> 19:48.643
I came here to chew bubble gum
and kick ass...

19:48.644 --> 19:50.853
And I'm all out of bubble gum.

19:50.854 --> 19:55.316
I may use that sometime,
but right now? Take a bow.

19:55.317 --> 19:56.817
Hmm-hmm.

19:56.818 --> 19:59.862
We have a deal.
Give her a hand.

20:01.006 --> 20:02.698
Yeah.

20:04.424 --> 20:07.845
Well, good morning,
Contra security...

20:07.846 --> 20:11.599
a division
of optimal consumer products.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.627
It's about to get
real awesome up in <i>hea.</i>

20:16.355 --> 20:19.674
My sharonnie. Nice to see you
being such a good sport.

20:19.675 --> 20:21.175
Well, you know me.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.594
It's gonna be real joy
having you here.

20:23.595 --> 20:25.805
Well, that remains to be seen.

20:25.806 --> 20:28.366
By the by, I don't know
if you're still interested in

20:28.367 --> 20:30.768
these self-evaluation letters,
but you never got mine.

20:30.769 --> 20:33.037
Oh. Well, thank you.

20:33.038 --> 20:35.064
Cheerio.

20:36.241 --> 20:37.400
<i>"Dear Ronnie,</i>

20:37.401 --> 20:39.460
<i>"you said,
when you buy a company,</i>

20:39.461 --> 20:43.247
<i>"you buy more than the name...
you buy the people in it.</i>

20:43.248 --> 20:45.166
<i>"You came here
to figure out who we are</i>

20:45.167 --> 20:47.251
<i>"and to define us
in our simplest terms</i>

20:47.592 --> 20:49.412
<i>"and most convenient

20:53.208 --> 20:54.417

20:54.418 --> 20:56.961

20:56.962 --> 20:58.462

20:58.463 --> 21:00.514

you think we're a bad bet,</i>

21:00.515 --> 21:03.517
<i>"but sometimes the longest odds
pay off the best.</i>

21:03.518 --> 21:06.570
<i>Sincerely yours,
the Contra club."</i>

21:06.571 --> 21:10.524
Well... seems like we may
have our work cut out for us.
