WEBVTT

00:36.360 --> 00:39.560
LOW RADIO CHATTER

00:42.560 --> 00:45.040
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH:
These people are hunting

00:45.040 --> 00:48.200
for one of the most endangered
animals on the planet.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.920
The black rhino -
an animal poached for its horn.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.040
GUN FIRES

01:11.800 --> 01:14.000
But they aren't going to harm her.

01:16.040 --> 01:20.240
Dumi Zwane and his team
are on a rescue mission.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.440
DUMI:  I don't think I'll ever
stop fighting for rhino.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.520
It's just not possible.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.000
OK! Yeah...

01:28.000 --> 01:32.080
They're setting up a new breeding
colony in a safe haven.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.680
Get her on two.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.760
Two. OK. That's good.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.560
This female is going to be
at the very centre of it.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.760
She weighs over a tonne...

01:45.760 --> 01:47.040
Go!

01:47.040 --> 01:49.560
..and there's only one way
to get her out.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.000
That's it.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.440
There we are. Perfect!

02:05.400 --> 02:09.040
When I watch it fly off,
it's very emotional.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.920
It's a beautiful feeling.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.560
She is sedated and safe...

02:23.080 --> 02:26.960
...and in less than half an hour,
she'll be back on the ground

02:26.960 --> 02:33.400
and starting a new life in a project
that could save her entire species,

02:33.400 --> 02:37.440
thanks to Dumi and
his remarkable team.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.280
We started making the very first
Planet Earth series

02:55.280 --> 02:57.920
just over 20 years ago.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.080
Since then, our camera teams
have filmed all over the world

03:02.080 --> 03:06.560
and visited some of its wildest
and most remote corners.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.480
But the truth is that most
of the animals we filmed

03:16.480 --> 03:21.280
over these last two decades
are now rarer than they were.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.160
And the places where they live

03:25.160 --> 03:28.240
are in greater danger
of destruction.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.520
But I've seen another change
in those years,

03:31.520 --> 03:33.680
a hopeful change.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.200
A new generation of remarkable
people are stepping up

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
to save wildlife.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.440
They're overcoming huge obstacles,

03:41.440 --> 03:43.600
travelling to dangerous places,

03:43.600 --> 03:47.000
and sometimes even risking
their lives.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.200
To me, they are true heroes.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.520
This is the story of some of them.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.040
Hidden in the heart of the Andes

04:05.040 --> 04:08.640
is the Centro Jambatu
research centre.

04:11.480 --> 04:15.680
It's protecting members of
what is, perhaps surprisingly,

04:15.680 --> 04:19.440
the most endangered group of animals
in the world.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.920
Frogs.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.880
These individuals are the very last
of their particular species.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.160
They're brought here not only
for protection,

04:35.160 --> 04:37.680
but, more importantly,

04:37.680 --> 04:39.440
to increase their numbers.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.000
And the person to find them...

04:44.440 --> 04:46.400
..Jaime Culebras.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.560
I was seven the first time
that I saw a frog

04:51.560 --> 04:55.320
and just changed my life.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.920
And ever since his childhood,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.480
he's been exploring the
remotest places

05:01.480 --> 05:04.320
and searching for the rarest frogs.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.040
This is a leaf frog.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.440
He is just amazing.

05:13.440 --> 05:18.240
It's impossible to don't fall in
love with an animal like this, no?

05:23.040 --> 05:26.680
But there is one frog here
that is very special.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.880
His name, Sad Santiago.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.920
This is Sad Santiago.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.280
He's sad because he's alone.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.920
He's one of the last members
of his species.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.520
And he needs a female.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.080
Known as the Morona-Santiago
harlequin frog,

05:53.080 --> 05:57.000
he may be the rarest frog
in the world.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.920
While the other frogs here
are doing their best

06:02.920 --> 06:05.720
to increase their populations,

06:05.720 --> 06:11.200
Santiago has sat alone
for four long years.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.880
Maybe it's not the most beautiful
frog, but he deserves love.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.880
Santiago has now grown old,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.880
and if Jaime can't find a female
for him soon,

06:22.880 --> 06:25.560
the whole species could
become extinct.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.160
THUNDER RUMBLES

06:31.480 --> 06:34.840
The last place where one
of these frogs was seen...

06:36.840 --> 06:42.240
..was high up on a mountain
in the cloud forest of Ecuador.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.720
There's only one way to get there.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.280
DONKEY SNORTS

07:04.280 --> 07:08.760
Joining him is fellow
frog-hunter Darwin

07:08.760 --> 07:12.960
and Jaime's partner and
frog scientist, Francesca.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.520
Oh!

07:16.520 --> 07:19.080
Come on, vamanos.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.360
Arriba.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.320
FRANCESCA:  This is one of
the wettest places on Earth,

07:30.320 --> 07:34.160
and right now it's actually the
wet season, the rainy season,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.240
so it rains even more.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.560
Soaking wet and teeming with bugs...

07:41.200 --> 07:44.000
..it's a perfect place for frogs.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Let's go.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.080
Most frogs come out of hiding
at night.

07:51.920 --> 07:56.240
This place is extremely wonderful.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.520
But you have to be careful where
you put your hands.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.400
Being with him is...

08:08.400 --> 08:10.000
..it's unusual.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's not your regular relationship.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.560
SHE LAUGHS

08:15.720 --> 08:19.200
Oh, he's obsessed.
He's really obsessed.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.480
Streams like this should be
full of frogs

08:22.480 --> 08:24.240
of many different species...

08:26.560 --> 08:30.440
..but they search all night
and find nothing.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.320
It's a silent forest.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.160
It's sad.

08:47.720 --> 08:53.720
The sound of frogs is slowly
disappearing from our world.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.440
The only place many frog species
can now be found

09:00.440 --> 09:03.000
is in a museum.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.920
A key reason is the spread of
a fungus called chytrid...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.960
..that can grow on the
moist skins of frogs,

09:15.960 --> 09:17.760
eventually killing them.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.840
90 species are thought to have
become extinct as a consequence,

09:23.840 --> 09:27.960
and almost 600 more are now
critically endangered.

09:30.960 --> 09:36.640
Before chytrid, I'm pretty sure
that you could walk

09:36.640 --> 09:40.720
through the stream and
see everywhere

09:40.720 --> 09:45.200
many, many, many frogs on the rocks,

09:45.200 --> 09:48.080
calling "prrr-prrr"!

09:51.560 --> 09:57.160
I wish I had been born before
the frog disease.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.640
Night after night...

10:07.480 --> 10:10.160
..they search the stream.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.920
Jaime!

10:20.920 --> 10:23.800
At last, there is a discovery.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.320
The sound is a...
JAIME TRILLS

10:27.440 --> 10:30.440
I don't know exactly where,
but it's there, more or less.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.160
En el agua!

10:34.520 --> 10:36.200
We have it.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.760
A glass frog.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.160
A really beautiful glass frog.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.280
Glass frogs are becoming
increasingly rare,

10:46.280 --> 10:48.920
and one day they, too,
could disappear.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.920
But it's not what they are
looking for.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.400
The fact is that countless species
go extinct...

10:59.400 --> 11:00.760
..unnoticed.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.720
All Jaime can do is to
continue his search

11:07.720 --> 11:10.120
for a mate for Santiago.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.360
It's there?

11:27.800 --> 11:30.120
I found a female!

11:34.320 --> 11:35.600
Agh!

11:37.040 --> 11:38.520
Woohoo!

11:42.960 --> 11:45.480
It's a female! Look.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.240
The size is bigger than the males.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.080
Wow.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.760
I feel so happy!

11:53.760 --> 11:55.640
The first female!

11:57.040 --> 12:01.240
She could be the cornerstone of
a new breeding programme.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.320
Santiago will be very, very,
very, very, very happy.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.960
JAIME LAUGHS

12:06.960 --> 12:09.320
Because she's really beautiful!

12:10.600 --> 12:13.000
In my hand, I have hope.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.760
I have the saviour of this species,

12:15.760 --> 12:18.920
for breeding programmes and
for people to reproduce it.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.200
I don't know, it's like
I just have hope in my hand.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.240
There are over 7,000 species
of frogs in the world,

12:30.240 --> 12:33.280
and you may well ask...

12:33.280 --> 12:36.800
..does it really matter if a few
go extinct?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.560
Well, just look at this tiny species

12:45.560 --> 12:47.800
of poison arrow frog.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.560
Scientists discovered a chemical
on its skin...

12:54.840 --> 12:58.440
..200 times stronger than morphine.

13:01.160 --> 13:06.680
Now they are studying how it works
to create powerful new painkillers.

13:11.560 --> 13:16.160
But the natural world is not just
one vast medicine chest.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.680
It's far more than that.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.600
It is our life support system,

13:21.600 --> 13:25.160
the fabric that holds
our world together.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.560
Remove a part of it,
a species or a habitat,

13:28.560 --> 13:31.480
and there's no knowing
what could happen.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.880
LOW RUMBLING

13:37.960 --> 13:41.760
A prime example is the
forest elephant.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.200
They play a crucial role
in maintaining

13:44.200 --> 13:46.280
the rainforests of Africa...

13:46.280 --> 13:48.640
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

13:48.640 --> 13:51.160
..dispersing seeds and
making clearings

13:51.160 --> 13:54.120
that are then used by many
other animals.

14:02.240 --> 14:06.120
We filmed these images in 2004

14:06.120 --> 14:07.960
for the first Planet Earth series.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.960
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

14:11.640 --> 14:14.800
Nine years later, poachers came here

14:14.800 --> 14:17.400
and killed 26 elephants
for their ivory...

14:20.280 --> 14:23.160
..including four of the calves.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.280
Since that first series,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.960
the number of forest elephants
across Africa

14:33.960 --> 14:36.320
has dropped by two-thirds.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.920
But stopping the slaughter
is a risky business.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.480
Abidjan, in Cote d'Ivoire,
West Africa...

14:54.480 --> 14:59.800
..part of the global network
in the illegal ivory trade.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.440
A stranger has flown in
from Vietnam,

15:11.440 --> 15:14.200
a hub for the import of ivory.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.840
Her name - Trang Nguyen.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.160
Her speciality - infiltrating
the illegal wildlife trade

15:43.160 --> 15:44.960
by posing as a buyer.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.520
Trang is working with a network of
conservationists called EAGLE.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.880
Her contact here is Rens Ilgen.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.080
But what is particular with this
new trade in West Africa is,

16:33.080 --> 16:36.800
as you can see, a lot of the tusks
are from baby elephants.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.920
So, they're really down to
the last elephants.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.600
Last week, seven people were killed.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.080
Seven ranger was killed?

16:45.080 --> 16:47.280
So, clearly, it is not just about
the ivory trade,

16:47.280 --> 16:50.440
but a lot of people, rangers,
that are being killed as well.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.240
It's...it's war.
It's war.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.240
And they're even going for
the baby elephants.  Yeah.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.560
Now Trang is set her task.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.400
So, I want you to meet the godfather
of ivory.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.000
We already arrested him
four years ago

17:06.000 --> 17:08.120
when he had 400kg of ivory,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.520
which he was supplying to
the Vietnamese community

17:10.520 --> 17:13.480
linked to the Vietnamese mafia.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.200
As he has been arrested before,
he might be very cautious.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.960
It might be dangerous.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.320
She prepares her disguise
as a businesswoman -

17:25.320 --> 17:27.800
but under her jacket,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.680
hidden recording equipment.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.640
EAGLE's undercover agents
have been following

17:33.640 --> 17:35.640
the godfather for years.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.880
Now is the moment to catch him.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.680
This is your first meeting.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.000
You're just going to discuss
and get to know each other.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.600
See if they have the products.
Exactly.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.560
I'm going in,

17:58.560 --> 18:02.160
and I need to sit facing away
from the door,

18:02.160 --> 18:04.760
because I don't want people
to see me with him.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.720
We will be close by...  Yep.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.680
..and nothing will go wrong.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.360
OK.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.040
Good luck.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.360
Bye.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.560
She meets the godfather
at a local cafe.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.760
The secret cameras capture
the story.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.560
TRANG:  Mm-hm.

19:09.560 --> 19:14.040
But the godfather denies
having any ivory for sale.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.680
TRANG:  Merci.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.480
Merci.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.320
Perhaps there's no ivory.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.240
Or maybe he doesn't trust Trang.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.600
It's a serious setback.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.160
But there are other traders
out there.

19:53.160 --> 19:57.200
Perhaps her presence in town
will draw them in.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.080
Every day that passes,

20:03.080 --> 20:05.920
more elephants are killed.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.880
For Trang,
this work is very personal.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.680
When I was 23, I got the phone call.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.960
The doctor told me
that I had bowel cancer.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.600
The first thing pop up in my mind
is that I'm so young,

20:36.600 --> 20:38.200
well, how can I get cancer?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.280
Once you have cancer,

20:42.280 --> 20:44.920
you don't know how long
you're going to live for,

20:44.920 --> 20:48.240
and if I want to do anything,
then I should just do it now.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.160
And that's when I said, "OK,
I'm just going to do undercover,"

20:52.160 --> 20:54.320
because I don't know when
I'm going to die.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.000
I might as well do something
really meaningful.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.880
Currently, Trang is in remission.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.000
Three days later,
there's a breakthrough.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.440
PHONE PINGS

21:21.440 --> 21:25.400
A video sent by a trader.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.480
I can see that this video
have about 14, 15 ivory.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.880
They are big tusks, they are
also small tusks as well.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.240
It's obviously come from
baby elephants.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.920
The bait has been taken.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.680
Trang and the EAGLE team
must act fast.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.240
She goes to meet the new targets.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.080
First job...

21:56.080 --> 21:57.160
TRANG:  Bonsoir.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.920
..gain their trust.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.840
Cheers.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.920
Cheers.  Cheers.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.360
TRANG SPEAKING ENGLISH:

22:19.880 --> 22:21.360
TRADER:  OK.

22:21.360 --> 22:25.440
Eventually, Trang persuades
the traders to move to

22:25.440 --> 22:28.760
a hotel room nearby...

22:28.760 --> 22:32.440
..to weigh the ivory and
make the transaction.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.800
TRANG:  Close the door.
Close the door.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.960
Ivory is sold by the kilo.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.920
TRANG:  That is just over 20.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.280
20.2?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.760
TRADER:  20.3.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.120
A whole elephant family was killed
for this haul.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.200
LOW CHATTER

23:15.200 --> 23:18.000
It's worth over £5,000.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.080
Here, that is a year's salary.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.760
What the traders don't realise...

23:27.760 --> 23:30.960
..is that the police are
in the room above,

23:30.960 --> 23:33.800
waiting for a text from Trang.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.440
SOFTLY:  OK, let's go.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.560
WHISPERING

23:59.560 --> 24:01.200
KNOCK ON DOOR

24:01.200 --> 24:02.680
TRANG:  Who's there?

24:03.800 --> 24:05.160
Service?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.680
TRANG:  You go open the door.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.120
TRADER:  OK.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.800
QUIETLY:  Just put it down here.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.200
Police! Police!

24:22.200 --> 24:23.920
TRANG SCREAMS

24:23.920 --> 24:25.840
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.880
TRANG SCREAMS

24:37.200 --> 24:39.960
TRANG SPEAKING FRENCH:

24:42.560 --> 24:44.400
For her own safety,

24:44.400 --> 24:48.120
she has to keep her cover story
and behave as a criminal...

24:48.120 --> 24:50.000
MUFFLED SHOUTING

24:52.120 --> 24:56.040
..which means she must also
be arrested.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.040
POLICE ISSUE ORDERS

25:06.040 --> 25:09.640
A link in the global supply chain...

25:09.640 --> 25:10.960
..broken.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.440
Trang is whisked away,

25:22.440 --> 25:25.880
whilst the traders are taken
to the police station,

25:25.880 --> 25:29.120
none the wiser about
her involvement.

25:35.680 --> 25:41.120
Over the next year,
EAGLE catch 140 more traffickers

25:41.120 --> 25:44.960
in the fight against the global
wildlife trade.

25:47.520 --> 25:50.960
But for Trang,
this is her last operation.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.880
It's why we can show her face.

26:04.720 --> 26:09.360
It's not safe for her to stay
a minute longer than necessary.

26:14.640 --> 26:20.320
Trang's final task is to vanish
from Abidjan...

26:20.320 --> 26:22.280
..for ever.

26:29.080 --> 26:35.480
Across the world, the numbers of
wild animals are falling alarmingly.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.800
In just two decades -

26:37.800 --> 26:40.960
since we started making the
first Planet Earth series -

26:40.960 --> 26:44.640
the abundance of wildlife
around the globe has dropped,

26:44.640 --> 26:47.800
on average, by over 30%.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.440
We're facing a disaster,
a catastrophe.

26:53.600 --> 26:58.160
Scientists say that we're on
the edge of a mass extinction.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.480
It's being caused by human activity.

27:03.480 --> 27:07.400
So humans also have the power
to stop it.

27:10.640 --> 27:14.600
It takes many qualities to save
even one species.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.480
Determination...

27:21.160 --> 27:22.920
..courage...

27:24.480 --> 27:26.360
..and passion.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.200
And often, there's another
ingredient that's needed...

27:33.920 --> 27:36.960
..the ability to think big.

27:40.680 --> 27:46.400
In Vienna, Katharina Huchler is just
starting a new job.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.360
The pay is terrible.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.480
The hours are long.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.920
And there are no days off.

27:57.480 --> 28:01.520
She is about to become
a foster mother.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.800
Hi.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.360
Hi.
CHEEPING

28:04.360 --> 28:05.560
Good morning.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.640
Hi. Hi.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.960
And these are her new babies...

28:08.960 --> 28:10.200
Oh.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.080
You're pretty awake. Hi.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.560
..28 of one of the world's
rarest birds.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.120
Hey. Hi.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.040
The northern bald ibis.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.520
You really quickly fall
in love with them.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.000
KATHARINA LAUGHS

28:25.000 --> 28:29.320
They were hunted to extinction
in Europe over 400 years ago.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.680
These chicks were born in a zoo.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.440
Katharina's task is to teach them

28:37.440 --> 28:40.400
to become wild, free birds.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.480
Yes, yes, yes. Komm. Komm.

28:43.480 --> 28:48.240
To do that, she must convince them
that she is their mother.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.120
It's a process called imprinting.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.960
While it's happening,
the chicks must never see or hear

28:54.960 --> 28:58.520
any other human except Helena,

28:58.520 --> 29:02.000
who's an ibis foster mum
for the second time.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.920
They must always wear identical
yellow clothes

29:05.920 --> 29:10.200
and repeat the same noises
again and again.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.080
We mimic the sounds the adults make,
it's like...

29:14.080 --> 29:16.160
SHE MAKES HOARSE CALL

29:16.160 --> 29:17.880
Kkrukk!

29:17.880 --> 29:19.560
Kkrukk!  Kklup.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.960
Kklup.  Kklup.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.280
Kklup.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.760
But I'm not good yet at doing it!

29:23.760 --> 29:25.000
THEY LAUGH

29:25.000 --> 29:26.560
Goodnight.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.720
They're here when the chicks
fall asleep...

29:28.720 --> 29:30.160
Sleep well.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.000
..and the first thing they see
when they awake.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.160
Good morning, waldies! Hallo!

29:37.160 --> 29:40.120
Let's have something to eat,
shall we? Yes, let's eat.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.680
They're a bit like every human baby.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.400
They just need their food
bit by bit by bit

29:46.400 --> 29:47.760
all day long.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.680
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.560
Oh, no, we did it all wrong!

29:52.560 --> 29:54.280
Oh!  Aw!

29:54.280 --> 29:56.840
It's really like changing the
nappies of the babies.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.560
28 mouths to feed
and bottoms to wipe,

30:00.560 --> 30:03.600
and all the time talking
to the birds.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.960
Komm, komm, waldies! Komm, komm!

30:05.960 --> 30:07.600
Feeling really tired.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.280
Yeah, I'd really like to sleep
a little bit more.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.640
As the weeks pass, the bond grows.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.560
And then it is time for
their next stage

30:18.560 --> 30:20.760
in becoming wild birds.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.520
They move to a field in
the Austrian Alps.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.200
They've now grown their adult
flight feathers...

30:38.680 --> 30:41.400
...but they're still chicks
on the inside.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.600
So the imprinting must continue.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.080
With this hand gesture we do,

30:48.080 --> 30:51.120
we imitate the bill of an adult ibis

30:51.120 --> 30:53.080
and we combine it with
the greeting sound.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.320
So, this is...

30:54.320 --> 30:56.280
Kklup! Kklup!

30:56.280 --> 31:01.360
All this imprinting is for
a very important reason.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.440
These are migratory birds.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.080
In autumn, they must fly south

31:09.080 --> 31:12.200
to their warm feeding grounds
in Italy.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.080
And that is a problem.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.560
They know that they need
to go somewhere,

31:19.560 --> 31:23.080
but they don't know in which
direction and how far.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.440
So they need to learn the route
from their parents.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.560
Their human mothers must show them
the way.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.480
And that requires a little
ingenuity.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.400
ENGINE POWERS UP

31:44.720 --> 31:48.160
This is where the imprinting
is put to the test.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.400
Will the birds follow them...

32:01.880 --> 32:03.840
..even in a microlight?

32:03.840 --> 32:05.640
KATHARINA:  Komm, komm!

32:05.640 --> 32:07.600
Komm, komm, waldies!

32:07.600 --> 32:09.320
Komm, komm!

32:18.040 --> 32:20.440
TRANSLATION:

32:23.000 --> 32:26.800
Getting too close is dangerous
for both birds and humans.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

32:55.040 --> 32:57.320
After a wobbly start...

32:58.720 --> 33:00.840
..at last they settle.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.240
The imprinting has worked.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.000
Our birds did very well today.

33:30.160 --> 33:33.480
But their biggest challenge
is still to come.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.040
The Zillertal Alps.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.160
A great wall of rock and ice.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.600
It's going to be the most
important flight

34:00.600 --> 34:02.520
of their young lives.

34:03.640 --> 34:07.840
It will take them to the very edge
of exhaustion.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.480
A lot of young birds die during
their first migration.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.440
They are still so inexperienced.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.640
There's also danger for the
foster mothers and the pilots.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.280
If there is a problem with
the microlights,

34:24.280 --> 34:26.600
there is no safe place to land.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.160
To gain enough height to fly
over these mountains...

34:35.520 --> 34:39.680
..they must find columns of
rising air called thermals.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.720
A skill these birds would
normally learn

34:46.720 --> 34:49.240
by following their natural mothers.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.120
WIND WHISTLES

35:05.840 --> 35:09.640
It takes expert piloting
to find the thermals.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.520
Once within one,

35:20.520 --> 35:23.480
it's turbulent and unpredictable.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.280
With every turn,
the mothers must make sure

35:46.280 --> 35:49.120
all 28 birds are following.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.240
All 28 birds here.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.840
Phew.
SHE LAUGHS IN RELIEF

36:31.600 --> 36:36.320
At last, they make it over
the highest ridge.

36:50.440 --> 36:54.960
From now on,
it should be easy flying.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.080
KATHARINA:  What we are trying to do,
apart from saving the ibis,

37:19.080 --> 37:21.720
is trying to give hope to people.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.200
If you can bring back one species,

37:27.200 --> 37:29.320
you can also do it with others.

37:42.200 --> 37:46.960
A species once left for dead
now has a future.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.160
And they head for their
safe winter home

37:54.160 --> 37:56.880
in a protected nature reserve.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.720
HORN BEEPS

38:19.720 --> 38:23.760
But as we have seen
throughout this series,

38:23.760 --> 38:29.160
many species are losing the wild
habitats they need to survive.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.880
It's the biggest cause
of extinction.

38:43.360 --> 38:48.920
Nowhere is this more apparent than
in the Amazon rainforest.

38:52.360 --> 38:56.120
Our Planet Earth crews have filmed
here many times

38:56.120 --> 38:58.720
over the last two decades.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.920
TIMBER CREAKING

39:06.920 --> 39:12.640
And in that time,
over 16,000 million trees...

39:14.680 --> 39:16.720
..have been felled.

39:22.440 --> 39:26.840
To safeguard the countless species
that live here...

39:26.840 --> 39:29.480
..the forest itself must be
protected..

39:31.880 --> 39:36.480
And there's a force rising up
to do just that.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.960
TRANSLATION:

40:02.480 --> 40:07.240
Alessandra Korap is one of
the leaders of the Munduruku.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.480
They have been the guardians
of this part of the Amazon

40:12.480 --> 40:15.040
for thousands of years.

40:52.440 --> 40:57.320
When she was a child,
this part of the Amazon forest

40:57.320 --> 41:01.120
stretched unbroken
for hundreds of miles.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.360
Now it's being carved up...

41:11.560 --> 41:14.640
..for mining, for timber,

41:14.640 --> 41:17.640
but most of all for agriculture.

41:20.960 --> 41:25.400
This is the front line in
the battle for the Amazon,

41:25.400 --> 41:27.760
and it is a deadly one.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.480
In the last decade, more than
300 people have been murdered

41:36.480 --> 41:39.720
in Brazil defending the environment.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.880
The Munduruku,
like many indigenous groups,

42:10.880 --> 42:13.480
live in isolated communities

42:13.480 --> 42:18.040
vulnerable to attack from miners,
farmers and loggers.

42:44.920 --> 42:49.640
The Amazon's future is decided
2,000 miles away.

42:52.720 --> 42:55.520
Here, in the parliament of Brazil,

42:55.520 --> 42:59.360
new laws are being debated to allow
the exploitation

42:59.360 --> 43:01.800
of their traditional tribal land.

43:06.680 --> 43:10.280
But Alessandra has a plan -

43:10.280 --> 43:13.120
to unite with other tribes

43:13.120 --> 43:15.960
and organise a protest so big

43:15.960 --> 43:18.560
that it cannot be ignored.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.920
It's a three-day journey
to the capital city.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.040
HORN BLARES

44:14.440 --> 44:17.600
Trucks rumble to and from
the fields...

44:19.480 --> 44:23.080
..land that used to be rainforest.

44:24.320 --> 44:28.520
They're carrying thousands of tonnes
of soya beans.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.160
It's shipped from the heart of
the Amazon across the world.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.720
Not to feed humans...

44:39.720 --> 44:41.800
..but to feed livestock.

45:05.480 --> 45:09.560
Eventually, Alessandra makes it
to Brasilia.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.760
News of the protest has spread
all over the country.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.120
200 groups have united
in a huge camp.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.880
PROTESTORS SING

45:25.880 --> 45:29.160
From the northeast of Brazil -
the Xukuru.

45:30.880 --> 45:34.280
From the southern edge of
the Amazon - the Karaja.

45:45.640 --> 45:50.280
For ten days, they protest against
the proposed laws.

46:08.560 --> 46:12.160
Alessandra and the other
leaders have created

46:12.160 --> 46:17.000
the biggest protest by indigenous
people ever held in Brazil.

46:26.400 --> 46:31.440
Later, one of the proposed laws
was withdrawn.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.960
A small but significant victory

46:39.960 --> 46:43.680
in Alessandra's fight for
Brazil's wild places.

46:52.040 --> 46:56.360
The destruction of habitats is
currently the biggest threat

46:56.360 --> 46:59.320
to the survival of animal species.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.800
But there is an even greater
disaster on the horizon.

47:03.800 --> 47:06.440
Our climate is changing.

47:06.440 --> 47:10.400
Seasons have become unpredictable
and more extreme.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.360
Our planet is getting hotter.

47:16.360 --> 47:20.040
Scientists predict that if
the global temperature

47:20.040 --> 47:22.800
rises by over two degrees,

47:22.800 --> 47:27.000
it is likely to become the number
one cause of extinction.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.080
To halt climate change,

47:32.080 --> 47:35.320
perhaps politicians need
to become heroes, too.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.200
REPORTER:  Hello, good evening,
and a warm welcome to Glasgow

47:39.200 --> 47:42.400
and the start of the long-awaited
climate summit, COP26.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.920
World leaders, prominent scientists

47:44.920 --> 47:47.240
and advisers all ready
for 12 days of...

47:47.240 --> 47:49.880
Mohamed Nasheed is a politician,

47:49.880 --> 47:53.000
the former president of
the Maldives.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.760
MOHAMED:  The doctors said that
they took 16 ball bearings

47:56.760 --> 48:00.680
from all parts of my body.

48:00.680 --> 48:03.480
I was unconscious for two days.

48:05.400 --> 48:10.440
Over his political career,
he has been tortured, imprisoned

48:10.440 --> 48:14.080
and recently survived
an assassination attempt.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.440
But during that time,

48:18.440 --> 48:22.760
he's also fought relentlessly
against climate change.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.640
..pleasure to be able to bring you
Mohamed Nasheed.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.560
AUDIENCE CHEERS

48:29.560 --> 48:34.040
In Glasgow, on the eve
of climate conference COP26,

48:34.040 --> 48:35.920
he is addressing a rally.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.520
Thank you.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.440
Thank you very much.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.400
So, we come to COP26

48:46.400 --> 48:49.840
to find out whether
we still have a future.

48:49.840 --> 48:54.360
If we cannot have
a legally binding agreement

48:54.360 --> 48:58.360
not to push global temperatures

48:58.360 --> 49:00.880
above 1.5 degrees,

49:00.880 --> 49:03.440
my country will be gone,

49:03.440 --> 49:06.040
as will all the world's coral reefs

49:06.040 --> 49:09.680
and most of the rainforests.

49:09.680 --> 49:14.000
Is all this devastation
really worth it,

49:14.000 --> 49:18.640
so that we can continue
to burn coal and fossil fuel

49:18.640 --> 49:21.000
for a few more years?

49:22.520 --> 49:26.560
I have spent a lifetime

49:26.560 --> 49:28.960
fighting for my country,

49:28.960 --> 49:31.960
and with more determination
than ever,

49:31.960 --> 49:36.560
because I know my time on Earth
might be cut short.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.960
Mohamed Nasheed's passion
for the natural world

49:40.960 --> 49:45.680
began the first time he saw
a coral reef.

49:56.920 --> 50:00.080
MOHAMED:  My earliest memory

50:00.080 --> 50:04.320
is with the ocean and the reef.

50:04.320 --> 50:09.880
We were the first generation
to actually see the reef.

50:09.880 --> 50:13.360
Masks and goggles came
to the Maldives

50:13.360 --> 50:16.040
in the late '60s, early '70s.

50:17.800 --> 50:25.040
Once we started seeing the reef
as a living creature...

50:25.040 --> 50:28.720
..we were just dumbfounded.

50:31.360 --> 50:36.120
But Nasheed's beloved coral
is now the habitat

50:36.120 --> 50:39.960
that is most threatened
by climate change.

50:44.280 --> 50:49.160
The critical tipping point is
a 1.5 degree temperature rise.

50:50.360 --> 50:53.440
Beyond that, most reefs will die,

50:53.440 --> 50:56.440
leaving nothing but rubble.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.920
When you think of a bigger picture,

51:01.920 --> 51:06.600
then your own life
is not so important.

51:08.400 --> 51:12.080
It's what you want to get done
which is important.

51:15.240 --> 51:19.360
Nasheed's aim is to persuade
politicians to cut the use

51:19.360 --> 51:21.800
of coal and other fossil fuels.

51:23.600 --> 51:27.280
He repeats this plea at every
climate conference.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.880
You need to be able to
convince people,

51:29.880 --> 51:32.040
try to educate people.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.840
We are in trouble.

51:33.840 --> 51:38.360
We will not survive if the planet
is heated above 1.5 degrees.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.560
We must act now.

51:40.560 --> 51:44.840
At first, journalists are reporting
on some eye-catching promises

51:44.840 --> 51:47.000
made by heads of state.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.640
REPORTER:  18 countries have
committed themselves

51:49.640 --> 51:52.440
to a plan to stop using coal-fired
power plants.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.280
It is an election issue now.

51:54.280 --> 51:57.960
That is why world leaders have
joined the rhetoric.

51:57.960 --> 52:03.680
The next stage -
turning promises into solid plans.

52:03.680 --> 52:07.120
And Nasheed is busy working
behind the scenes.

52:07.120 --> 52:10.080
If they don't agree, we will ring
their ministers, their presidents

52:10.080 --> 52:11.800
and get them online.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.920
I think that's what we're
trying to do.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.760
So let's do this.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.920
How are you, Prime Minister?

52:18.920 --> 52:20.160
Yeah, OK.  I can hear you,

52:20.160 --> 52:22.440
but I can hear the Prime Minister
much clearer.

52:22.440 --> 52:25.800
All countries need to agree
to the final text -

52:25.800 --> 52:28.040
and some won't.

52:28.040 --> 52:31.480
People who want to continue
fossil fuel,

52:31.480 --> 52:33.880
I think, are the bad guys.

52:33.880 --> 52:38.000
And people who want to change,
I feel, are the good guys.

52:39.320 --> 52:41.160
Thank you. Thank you so much.

52:42.760 --> 52:46.640
After 14 days, this COP closes...

52:46.640 --> 52:49.120
..with some progress,

52:49.120 --> 52:52.320
but also with big compromises.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.040
NEWSREADER:  An agreement
was finally reached this evening

52:55.040 --> 52:57.480
after a key section on
the future use of coal

52:57.480 --> 52:59.440
was at the last moment watered down.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.440
Without urgent new commitments,

53:04.440 --> 53:07.920
the target of 1.5 degrees
will be missed.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.920
It is disastrous.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.440
It will...

53:11.440 --> 53:14.240
If you picture this,
if you can fathom it...

53:16.840 --> 53:20.760
..the coral will bleach

53:20.760 --> 53:22.760
and they will die,

53:22.760 --> 53:24.920
and when they are dead,

53:24.920 --> 53:29.400
the fish and the marine life
that lives there...

53:29.400 --> 53:31.600
..cease to exist.

53:42.680 --> 53:45.960
You would have thought that your
normal prime minister

53:45.960 --> 53:47.640
and president...

53:49.200 --> 53:53.120
..would have a better grip on
understanding things.

53:53.120 --> 53:57.240
And not just go on and on and on

53:57.240 --> 53:59.480
about protecting their way of life.

54:02.240 --> 54:06.360
So it's frustrating to see
politicians...

54:07.600 --> 54:10.160
..who doesn't seem to understand it.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.760
With current policies,

54:16.760 --> 54:20.160
99% of coral reefs
could be gone...

54:21.840 --> 54:24.160
..in under 30 years.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.120
Other habitats will follow.

54:32.400 --> 54:34.080
You can't lose hope.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.280
You cannot give up.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.240
I will not stop.

54:42.160 --> 54:45.920
Nasheed believes there is
a solution.

54:49.640 --> 54:53.640
The more environment becomes
an election issue,

54:53.640 --> 54:57.160
there will be more action
on climate.

54:58.640 --> 55:03.080
Every time you vote,
in every election,

55:03.080 --> 55:05.320
please tick the planet.

55:18.560 --> 55:22.520
The challenge of saving species
can't be left to a few

55:22.520 --> 55:27.000
heroic individuals working
against the odds.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.640
It's those in positions
of great power

55:29.640 --> 55:32.240
who can make
the most difference.

55:32.240 --> 55:38.120
So, ultimately, it is they who must
take the most responsibility.

55:38.120 --> 55:43.440
Perhaps one of our roles is
to hold them to account.

55:43.440 --> 55:47.120
Time is running out
for many species,

55:47.120 --> 55:51.240
but I truly believe that if the
right decisions are made now,

55:51.240 --> 55:53.680
at this critical moment,

55:53.680 --> 55:57.200
there could still be a bright future
for all life

55:57.200 --> 56:00.280
on our wonderful planet Earth.
