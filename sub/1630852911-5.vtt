WEBVTT

00:07.790 --> 00:09.444
15?
15, RIGHT?

00:09.487 --> 00:11.228
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP YOUR OWN COUNT.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.927
THAT'S NOT WHAT
COACH SAID. 16.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.277
17.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.148
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
LET'S CALL IT.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.150
WHAT? OK.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.544
WHERE IS THEA?
BECAUSE THE REAL THEA

00:22.587 --> 00:24.372
WOULD NEVER QUIT PRACTICE
EARLY LIKE THAT.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.156
WELL, IT'S LIKE,
100 DEGREES,

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
NOT TO MENTION
MY FOREHAND IS FLAWLESS.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.725
HUH. OH, I GET IT.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.075
YOU'RE STILL UPSET ABOUT
US LOSING THE ALUMNI GAME.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.946
WELL, I'M NOT
THRILLED, BUT--

00:33.990 --> 00:35.252
OK, THEN WHAT IS IT?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.775
CLEARLY, YOU'RE
STILL PISSED AT ME,

00:36.819 --> 00:38.081
OR YOU WOULDN'T JUST
END PRACTICE LIKE THAT.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.909
SIMONE, NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.088
OK. LOOK.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.568
GRANNY HAS BEEN
BLOWING UP MY PHONE

00:46.611 --> 00:49.266
INSISTING THAT I GO
ON A BLIND DATE

00:49.310 --> 00:50.746
WITH HER FRIEND'S
GRANDSON,

00:50.789 --> 00:53.096
SOME SENIOR
NAMED KEVIN.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.532
I DON'T DATE.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.925
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.753
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
A NICELY-WORDED TEXT?

00:57.796 --> 00:59.711
THIS IS WHY I DON'T
TELL YOU THINGS.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.452
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:01.496 --> 01:02.845
IF WE WERE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

01:02.888 --> 01:04.325
I'D PROBABLY
OFFER TO HELP,

01:04.368 --> 01:06.109
BUT I'M SURE GRANNY
WILL UNDERSTAND

01:06.153 --> 01:07.850
WHEN YOU BLOW IT.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.721
HELP ME HOW?

01:09.765 --> 01:12.028
I DON'T KNOW.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.856
ESTABLISH A CONNECTION
WITH THE GUY.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.292
HOW DO I DO THAT?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.120
YOU LEARN ABOUT HIM.
IT'S JUST LIKE TENNIS.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.600
YOU USE WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT YOUR OPPONENT

01:18.643 --> 01:19.992
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.559
WELL, FINE. IF YOU
INSIST ON HELPING...

01:21.603 --> 01:23.257
I DID NOT
INSIST ON HELPING.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.607
I'LL MEET YOU IN
THE DORMS AFTER CLASS.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.783
DON'T BE LATE.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.313
I KNOW
PRESIDENT ALLEN SAID

01:36.357 --> 01:37.880
HE WAS TIGHTENING
THE PURSE STRINGS,

01:37.923 --> 01:39.664
BUT THAT MAN'S GOT US
OUT HERE SWEATING

01:39.708 --> 01:43.233
ON THE HOTTEST DAY
OF THE YEAR.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.192
UH, HELLO?

01:45.235 --> 01:47.194
HAS THE HEAT MADE YOU
FORGET YOUR MANNERS?

01:47.237 --> 01:49.326
I'M SORRY.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.591
SO?

01:53.635 --> 01:56.377
TARIQ AND SHANELLE
ARE COMING INTO TOWN

01:56.420 --> 01:58.466
NEXT WEEK
FOR A WEDDING,

01:58.509 --> 02:01.469
AND THEY WANT TO BRING
SHAY BY FOR A VISIT.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.514
DON'T TELL ME
YOU AREN'T EXCITED.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.777
YOU'VE BEEN MOPING
AROUND CAMPUS FOR WEEKS,

02:05.821 --> 02:07.518
TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH
YOU MISS THAT BABY.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.041
AUNTIE,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE

02:09.085 --> 02:11.522
THAT I WANT
THAN TO SEE SHAY.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.220
I JUST--

02:13.263 --> 02:16.005
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY
TOLD ANYONE HERE

02:16.048 --> 02:18.268
THAT I HAD A BABY

02:18.312 --> 02:21.053
AND GAVE HIM UP
FOR ADOPTION.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.012
I SEE.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.361
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT
ASHAMED OF HIM.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.494
I KNOW THAT I MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION,

02:26.537 --> 02:28.148
BUT FOR SO LONG,
MY LIFE HAS BEEN

02:28.191 --> 02:30.585
THIS BIG,
COMPLICATED PUZZLE.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.849
I GOT SCHOOL, TENNIS,
SHAY, AND JORDAN TO FIT IN.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.721
AND ONCE
I TELL EVERYBODY,

02:36.765 --> 02:38.723
IT'S JUST GONNA CHANGE
EVERYTHING.

02:38.767 --> 02:39.898
WELL, YOU

02:39.942 --> 02:41.378
CAN KEEP THEM SEPARATE.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.032
NOW, AUNTIE, YOU
KNOW I AM OUT HERE

02:43.075 --> 02:44.947
TRYING TO WALK
IN MY TRUTH.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.603
THEN YOU HAVE
YOUR ANSWER.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.219
NO. I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.699
WHAT? THOUGHT I LEFT
MY WATCH IN HERE

02:57.742 --> 03:00.005
OR SOMETHING,
BUT SINCE I'M HERE--

03:00.049 --> 03:01.964
YEP.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.574
OH, I FOUND IT.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.228
NICE TRY.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.534
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.797
COSTUMES FOR TONIGHT.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.060
I'M CHOREOGRAPHING
A MUSIC VIDEO

03:11.103 --> 03:13.236
FOR A 24-HOUR
DANCE COMPETITION.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.675
FIRST PRIZE
IS 5 GRAND

03:17.719 --> 03:19.242
AND A CLASS WITH
A TOP CHOREOGRAPHER.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.852
OH, THAT'S DOPE...

03:20.896 --> 03:22.245
YEAH. I KNOW.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.073
BUT I THOUGHT
DR. McCALLA HAD GIVEN UP

03:24.116 --> 03:25.944
ON HER LITTLE
DANCE DREAMS.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.859
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.687
IT'S A LOCAL CONTEST,
AND IT'S JUST FOR FUN.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.211
I'VE GOT TO FIND
A WAY TO CHANNEL

03:31.254 --> 03:32.690
MY CREATIVE ENERGY
SOMEHOW.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.258
OH. I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.521
OH...

03:37.565 --> 03:40.263
YOU ARE
DISTRACTING ME.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.525
MM.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.918
GOOD-BYE, CAM.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.399
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.705
GOOD LUCK
ON YOUR VIDEO.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.838

04:49.201 --> 04:50.942
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
J.R., HAVE YOU?

04:50.986 --> 04:52.683
HE WAS, LIKE, A NO-SHOW
FOR PRACTICE,

04:52.727 --> 04:54.903
AND NO ONE'S SEEN OR HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE SUNDAY.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.427
NO. HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE KAPPA HOUSE?

04:57.471 --> 04:59.647
I MEAN, HIS FRAT BROTHERS
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, EITHER.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.562
IT'S NOT REALLY
LIKE HIM, YOU KNOW?

05:01.605 --> 05:04.304
I'M SURE
HE'LL BE FINE.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.784
ARE YOU GOOD,
THOUGH?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.004
YOU JUST SEEM
KIND OF EDGY.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.962
I PUT IN MY REQUEST
WITH THE STATE

05:11.006 --> 05:12.703
FOR MY ADOPTION
RECORDS,

05:12.747 --> 05:14.662
I JUST GOT AN E-MAIL
BACK THIS MORNING.

05:14.705 --> 05:19.797
DAMON, THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT DID IT SAY?

05:19.841 --> 05:21.538
I HAVEN'T
OPENED IT YET.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.888
I MEAN, LIKE,
I WANT TO.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.108
I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.588
I KEEP THINKING,
LIKE,

05:27.631 --> 05:29.329
"WHAT KIND OF MOM
GIVES UP HER KID?"

05:32.941 --> 05:34.682
BUT YOU
WANTED TO TALK.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.336
MY BAD. WHAT'S UP?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.599
UM, NOTHING.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.818
YOU KNOW, UH, I'M--

05:40.862 --> 05:43.125
- WHOA...
- DAMN...

05:43.168 --> 05:45.475
WHAT THE...?

05:53.570 --> 05:56.181
-YO, WHAT IS GOING ON?
-THE POWER'S OUT.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.618
WELL, THAT'S
AN AMAZING OBSERVATION.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.577
HAVE WE ACTIVATED
THE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL?

06:00.621 --> 06:03.145
GIRL, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.712
OK.
MY DAD JUST SAID

06:04.755 --> 06:07.410
THAT THE BLACKOUT
IS CITYWIDE.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.716
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY LISTEN UP.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.239
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE HEAT WAVE

06:10.282 --> 06:12.415
STRESSED
THE POWER GRID,

06:12.459 --> 06:15.331
SO THE BLACKOUT'S
ALL OVER TOWN.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.898
GUESS WE GOT TO DO

06:16.941 --> 06:18.595
OUR PART TO STAY COOL.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.947
OK. NO. NO.
Y'ALL NEED TO CHILL.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.558
THIS BLACKOUT
IS NOT AN INVITATION

06:24.601 --> 06:26.255
FOR Y'ALL TO BE WILDING
IN THESE STREETS.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.257
NO. NO.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.477
I GIVE YOU AN "A"
FOR EFFORT.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.261
THANK YOU.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.958
I'M JUST GLAD THAT ART'S
THE R.A. ON DUTY AND NOT ME.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.525
OH, SPEAKING OF,
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO HELP HIM

06:35.569 --> 06:36.961
GATHER SOME CANDLES
AND SOME LIGHTS,

06:37.005 --> 06:39.834
SO Y'ALL BEHAVE,
ESPECIALLY YOU.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.488
-ME?
-OH.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.359
WELL,
I'LL CATCH Y'ALL LATER.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.317
UM,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:45.361 --> 06:47.842
OH, DEAR SIMONE,
WHAT HAPPENS

06:47.885 --> 06:50.540
IN THE BLACKOUT
STAYS IN THE BLACKOUT.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.760
OOH. HAVE FUN.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.370
I'M GONNA
RALLY UP

06:54.414 --> 06:55.589
SOME OF THE TEAM,
SEE IF I CAN FIND J.R.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.199
"FIND J.R."?

06:57.242 --> 06:58.940
I JUST SAW HIM UP
ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.508
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
GOT THE PARTY STARTED EARLY.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.292
WAIT. WAS HE DRUNK?

07:03.335 --> 07:05.468
OH, YEAH. HE'S
FEELING REAL GOOD.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.688
COME ON. LET'S GO
FIND HIM TOGETHER.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.733
UM, SIMONE,
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:09.777 --> 07:12.127
THEA, IT'S
A BLACKOUT.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.781
I DON'T CARE.
BLACKOUT OR NOT,

07:13.824 --> 07:15.391
GRANNY EXPECTS THIS
DATE TO HAPPEN.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.827
YOU PROMISED
TO HELP.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.047
WELL, THIS IS
KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.179
YEAH.
SO IS THIS.

07:21.223 --> 07:25.532
LOOK. I GOT J.R., OK?
YOU GUYS HANDLE BUSINESS.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.272
I'M GONNA
CATCH YOU LATER.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.535
MM-HMM.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.499
AMARA?

07:36.543 --> 07:37.674
DO YOU MIND?

07:37.718 --> 07:39.850
NONE OF THE DOORS
WILL BUDGE.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.504
PART OF THE FANCY
ELECTRONIC LOCKING SYSTEM

07:41.548 --> 07:43.027
THEY INSTALLED
LAST YEAR.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.768
THERE'S A MANUAL
BACKUP, I ASSUME.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.248
WHERE'S THE KEY?

07:46.291 --> 07:47.771
THAT'S A QUESTION
I'VE BEEN TRYING

07:47.815 --> 07:49.425
TO FIND THE ANSWER TO
FOR 20 MINUTES.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.905
SO WE'RE TRAPPED HERE.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.254
FACILITIES
ARE ALL BACKED UP,

07:52.297 --> 07:53.342
SAID AS LONG
AS WE'RE SAFE,

07:53.385 --> 07:54.343
JUST TO SIT TIGHT.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.040
IT MIGHT BE A WHILE.

07:56.084 --> 07:59.043
LOOK AT YOU.
HOT DATE?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.697
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.264
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:02.307 --> 08:04.309
WHEREVER YOU ARE NOT.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.530
WOMAN,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

08:07.574 --> 08:09.010
YOU STILL DRIVE ME CRAZY.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.272
YOU KNOW THAT?

08:10.315 --> 08:13.231
NOW YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL, BROTHER.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.364
YEAH.
SHE NICE, THOUGH.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.844
YO, J.
HEY, IS THAT YOU?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.498
HEY, I'M GONNA
CATCH YOU LATER, BRO.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.151
WHAT'S UP?
WHERE YOU BEEN?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.457
YO, I'M REALLY
NOT IN THE MOOD

08:21.501 --> 08:23.067
FOR A LECTURE
RIGHT NOW.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.634
OK. GOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT
HERE TO GIVE YOU ONE, BRO,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.549
BUT YOUR LITTLE
DISAPPEARING ACT,

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
THAT GOT COACH
AND THE WHOLE TEAM

08:28.159 --> 08:29.596
WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, MAN.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.945
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THIS FAMILY STUFF--

08:30.988 --> 08:32.468
PARENTS SPLITTING UP.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.470
THEY'RE DONE.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.648
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, BRO.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.563
LOOK. I KNOW
DIVORCE IS TOUGH,

08:40.607 --> 08:42.565
BUT COACH WILL UNDERSTAND
IF YOU JUST TALK--

08:42.609 --> 08:44.349
BUT I DON'T CARE
WHAT COACH THINKS.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.829
I'M DONE
WITH IT ALL--

08:45.873 --> 08:48.440
BASEBALL, CARING,
ALL OF IT. I QUIT.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.920
YO, HOLD UP. WHAT?

08:49.964 --> 08:51.487
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU QUIT?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.097
I'M OVER IT.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.186
BASEBALL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ME AND MY DAD'S THING.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.840
SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA QUIT THE TEAM

08:56.884 --> 08:58.146
AND SCREW UP
YOUR LIFE TO, WHAT,

08:58.189 --> 09:00.235
PISS OFF
YOUR PARENTS?

09:00.278 --> 09:02.063
THE TEAM WILL SURVIVE,

09:02.106 --> 09:04.326
AND DAMON SIMS WILL
LEAD THE WAY.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.458
COME ON, MAN.
TAKE IT BACK TO EDDIE'S ROOM.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.591
HEY, I'M GONNA
BE RIGHT THERE, BRO.

09:08.635 --> 09:12.073
COME ON, MAN. DON'T--
DON'T DO THIS.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.031
IT'S TIME TO STOP
TAKING THINGS SO SERIOUS.

09:14.075 --> 09:17.295
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
HA HA HA!

09:17.339 --> 09:19.167
HEY, J...

09:19.210 --> 09:21.473
THEA, I NEED
YOU TO WORK WITH ME.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.084
WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR
SPECIFIC INTERESTS?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.955
AND DO NOT SAY
TENNIS.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.957
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST THE NORMAL STUFF.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.611
GIVE ME SOMETHING,
ANYTHING--

09:28.655 --> 09:31.658
MOVIES, YOGA,
FRICKIN' BIRDWATCHING.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.097
THEA, HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN ON A DATE?

09:36.140 --> 09:38.447
SHH. KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.970
I MEAN,

09:40.014 --> 09:41.624
WITH ALL MY TRAVELING
FOR TOURNAMENTS,

09:41.668 --> 09:43.670
THERE WASN'T
TIME TO DATE.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.193
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND,
BUT IT TAKES A LOT

09:45.236 --> 09:46.847
OF SACRIFICE
TO BE NUMBER ONE.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.719
HEH. OK.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.809
I'M GONNA LET YOU
HAVE THAT ONE. LOOK...

09:52.853 --> 09:54.768
THE BEST CONNECTIONS
HAPPEN WHEN YOU BOTH

09:54.811 --> 09:56.378
HAVE SHARED INTERESTS,

09:56.421 --> 09:58.859
SO DOES KEVIN
HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA?

09:58.902 --> 10:00.512
YEAH.

10:03.428 --> 10:07.476
OH. HE FINE.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.740
OK. HE LIKES DOGS,
SURFING,

10:10.784 --> 10:12.612
OH, AND HE VOLUNTEERS
WITH BIG BROTHERS.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.222
THAT'S NICE.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.790
SO IF I'M
CHECKING HIM OUT,

10:16.833 --> 10:18.792
HE IS DOING
THE SAME.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.968
YES. DO YOU HAVE
SOCIAL MEDIA?

10:21.011 --> 10:24.101
WELL, OF COURSE.
BUILDING A BRAND.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.065
WOW.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.067
YOU PLAYED IN MADRID
WHEN YOU WERE 14?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.069
MM-HMM,
THE MADRID CLASSIC.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.680
I WON THE TOURNAMENT
IN A THIRD-SET TIEBREAK.

10:37.724 --> 10:42.206
ASIA, COSTA RICA,
THAILAND.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.817
GIRL, WHERE
HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED?

10:43.860 --> 10:45.296
ABU DHABI.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.516
I DON'T DO WELL
IN EXTREME HEAT.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.126
I WAS HOMESCHOOLED

10:49.170 --> 10:51.694
SO I COULD COMPETE
INTERNATIONALLY,

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
SO I DIDN'T HAVE A NORMAL
HIGH-SCHOOL EXPERIENCE,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.308
HENCE, NO DATING.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.224
WELL, LOOK AT ALL
THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.226
ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE
GONNA FIND SOME PICTURES

11:02.270 --> 11:04.315
THAT ARE
NON-TENNIS-RELATED,

11:04.359 --> 11:06.361
POST THEM, AND THEN
WE CAN HAVE A MOCK DATE

11:06.404 --> 11:09.364
SO I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO
TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.105
NON-TENNIS PHOTOS?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.107
GIRL, YES, LIKE--

11:15.892 --> 11:19.069
HEY, UH, EXCUSE ME.
CAN WE TALK REAL QUICK?

11:19.113 --> 11:23.030
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
KEEP LOOKING.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.729
I CAN'T BELIEVE J.R.
JUST QUIT THE TEAM.

11:26.773 --> 11:30.428
IT'S LIKE, I KNOW
THAT HE'S HURTING,

11:30.472 --> 11:32.039
BUT THIS IS HIS FUTURE
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.563
I MEAN,
HE DIDN'T MENTION

11:34.606 --> 11:37.174
WHY THEY WERE
SEPARATING?

11:37.218 --> 11:39.655
NO. I MEAN, HE WASN'T REALLY
FEELING THE HEART-TO-HEART.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.570
ITS GOT TO BE
MORE THAN JUST

11:41.613 --> 11:43.964
ABOUT HIS PARENTS'
DIVORCE, SIMONE.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.490
MAYBE I SHOULD
TALK TO HIM.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.886
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE REASONS

11:52.929 --> 11:55.540
I'M SO GOOD
ON THE BASEBALL FIELD

11:55.584 --> 11:57.542
IS BECAUSE
I CAN READ PEOPLE.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.545
I SAW YOU AND J.R.
TOGETHER ALL WEEK,

12:00.589 --> 12:03.766
AND I CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER, SIMONE,

12:03.810 --> 12:05.594
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU TWO.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.857
DAMON, J.R.'s PART
OF FAMILY DINNER

12:07.901 --> 12:10.338
EVERY WEEK
JUST LIKE YOU ARE.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.166
HE'S A FRIEND
WHO'S STRUGGLING,

12:12.209 --> 12:14.995
AND I CAN'T NOT
TRY AND HELP THAT.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
YEAH.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.346
I DO NEED A FAVOR
FROM YOU, THOUGH.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.956
THEA'S GOING
ON A BLIND DATE,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.045
AND SHE COULD USE
SOME ADVICE.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.786
HMM.

12:26.223 --> 12:30.619
HEY, J.R.'s GONNA BE FINE.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.839
YOU'LL SEE.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.328
SO SIMONE SAID
YOU GOT A BLIND DATE.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.156
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST
PUT UP A DAMN BANNER?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.505
HA HA!

12:47.549 --> 12:48.724
SHE THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULD USE

12:48.768 --> 12:49.986
A MALE'S
PERSPECTIVE.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.945
HMM.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.950
IS THIS PICTURE OK?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.825
-YEAH, YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
-HELL YEAH!

13:02.869 --> 13:05.785
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST FEELS FAKE TO ME.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.917
I'VE BEEN TO THE BEACH,
LIKE, 3 TIMES.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.528
I DON'T OWN A DOG.
I DON'T VOLUNTEER.

13:10.572 --> 13:13.314
MY LIFE IS TENNIS.
THAT'S IT.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.533
YOU SAY IT LIKE
IT'S NOT DOPE.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.361
I MEAN, YOU'VE
TRAVELED THE WORLD

13:17.405 --> 13:18.841
BECAUSE OF TENNIS.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.451
YEAH.
SIMONE TOLD YOU THAT?

13:20.495 --> 13:22.671
NO. I RESEARCH ALL
BRINGSTON'S ATHLETES,

13:22.714 --> 13:24.847
WANT TO SEE
WHO ELSE IS HERE

13:24.891 --> 13:26.762
PUTTING IN THAT WORK?

13:29.373 --> 13:31.767
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I NEVER CARED

13:31.811 --> 13:34.944
ABOUT ANY OF THIS, BUT NOW

13:34.988 --> 13:39.296
IT'S LIKE I'M BEHIND
IN A CONTEST I NEVER ENTERED.

13:39.340 --> 13:43.474
WELL, THERE'S A COST
TO BEING THE BEST.

13:45.302 --> 13:51.047
UM, SO, UM, WHO, UH,
PICKS UP THE CHECK?

13:51.091 --> 13:53.049
MAN, IT'S 2021.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.355
Y'ALL BETTER
SPLIT IT IN HALF.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.399
YEAH. IF HE'S
A GENTLEMAN,

13:55.443 --> 13:57.097
THEN HE'LL PAY.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.446
YEAH,
BUT SOME PEOPLE

13:58.489 --> 13:59.926
ARE GONNA EXPECT
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.797
I MEAN, GUYS CAN'T
ACTUALLY EXPECT YOU

14:01.841 --> 14:03.494
TO PUT OUT
FOR A FREE MEAL.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.627
GIRL,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:05.670 --> 14:07.585
LOOK. ALL GUYS DON'T.
THEY DON'T DO THAT.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.023
AND IT'S NOT JUST MEN.
WOMEN DO IT, TOO.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.720
THERE ARE EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY
OFFENDERS OUT HERE

14:11.763 --> 14:12.982
IN THESE STREETS,
BELIEVE THAT.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.462
WELL, I ALWAYS
PAY MY WAY,

14:14.505 --> 14:16.072
AND IF YOU WANT TO SMASH
ON THE FIRST DATE,

14:16.116 --> 14:18.335
THAT'S COOL,
BUT MAKE IT CLEAR.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.033
CONSENT MATTERS.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.299
WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD...

14:25.342 --> 14:28.258
NO. UM,

DIDN'T THINK I'D SEE
THE TEAM CAPTAIN

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
KICKING IT HERE
WITH THESE LOSERS.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.238

AND JUST GO FROM THE TOP.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.665
-OK.
-THANKS.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.884
YOU'RE PUTTING IN
THAT WORK, WHICH IS GOOD

16:12.928 --> 16:14.974
BECAUSE THE COMPETITION
JUST WENT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.671
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:16.714 --> 16:17.715
-YOU DIDN'T SEE?

THEY ADDED NORMANI
AS A SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.721
APPARENTLY, SHE'S
LOOKING FOR DANCERS

16:23.765 --> 16:25.506
TO BE IN HER
NEXT MUSIC VIDEO.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.029
YO, THIS IS FOR REAL.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.422
YEAH. IT'S DOPE,

16:28.465 --> 16:30.032
AND NOW YOU CAN
REALLY SHOOT YOUR SHOT.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.816
BUT I'M JUST, LIKE,
A CHOREOGRAPHER.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.253
CAN'T YOU DO BOTH?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.863
YOU GOT TO SHOW THEM
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.256
LOOK. I'LL EVEN
HELP YOU, OK?

16:36.299 --> 16:37.735
YOU TEXT ME

16:37.779 --> 16:39.346
-OK.
-YOU'RE GONNA KILL IT.

16:39.389 --> 16:42.001

HOO HOO HOO.

16:51.967 --> 16:55.710
HEY, HEY, HEY.
MY BAD. MY BAD.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.278
GOT THIS FOR YOU.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.628
I KNOW HOW YOU GET WHEN
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR DROPS.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.370
I WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANY BLOODSHED.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.900
MMM.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.777
I HATE HOW WELL
YOU KNOW ME.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.084
WELL, I HATE
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
DO YOU?

17:24.130 --> 17:27.176
MARCUS, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH US,

17:27.220 --> 17:29.091
AND WHAT WAS
THAT NONSENSE

17:29.135 --> 17:30.832
AT THE ALUMNI DINNER
WITH RALPH?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.400
YOU MEAN THAT CHILD
AND FORMER STUDENT, HUH?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.402
-OK. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M DONE.
-THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.752
YOU CAN SIT IN THE DARK,
PRETEND NOT TO BE JEALOUS

17:37.795 --> 17:39.275
BY YOUR DAMN SELF.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.016
OK, OK, OK, OK.
LISTEN, AMARA, WAIT...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.409
NO, MARCUS. YOU WAIT.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.107
WAIT, NOW.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.544
YOU WANT TO BE MR. INTEGRITY
WITH YOUR PLAYERS,

17:47.588 --> 17:50.112
GOING ON ABOUT HONESTY?

17:50.156 --> 17:51.548
CLEARLY, THAT'S
JUST LIP SERVICE

17:51.592 --> 17:52.941
SINCE YOU CAN'T EVEN
MAN UP TO TALK

17:52.984 --> 17:55.117
ABOUT US OR WHAT
WENT WRONG BETWEEN US.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.467
OH, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD ASK TINA.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.340
WHAT DOES MY SISTER
HAVE TO DO WITH US?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.993
NEVER MIND. LOOK.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.995
LET'S JUST LEAVE THE
PAST IN THE PAST, OK?

18:04.039 --> 18:06.389
OH, YOU MUST HAVE LOST
YOUR ENTIRE MIND

18:06.433 --> 18:09.349
IF YOU THINK
I'M LETTING THAT GO.

18:09.392 --> 18:13.222
WHAT DID TINA DO?

18:16.617 --> 18:18.445
SHE MADE IT CLEAR

18:18.488 --> 18:20.577
THAT I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.754
WHAT?
AND YOU BELIEVED HER?

18:23.798 --> 18:25.365
NOT AT FIRST.

18:25.408 --> 18:29.020
I MEAN, I WAS GOING
TO THE MINORS.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.762
HOW COULD THAT NOT
BE GOOD ENOUGH?

18:31.806 --> 18:34.243
I MEAN, THEN
THINGS GOT HARD.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.071
MY BATTING AVERAGE
CRATERED.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
THE PRESSURE
TO SUCCEED WAS REAL.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.509
SOME PLAYERS
AND COACHES, I MEAN,

18:39.553 --> 18:41.511
DOPING WASN'T
A BIG DEAL TO THEM.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.297
-YOU TOOK P.E.D.s?
-THE ONE TIME.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.516
I GAVE IN
TO THE PRESSURES

18:46.560 --> 18:48.257
ONE TIME, MAN,

18:48.301 --> 18:51.042
AND I TOLD MYSELF THAT,
EVERYBODY WAS DOING IT,

18:51.086 --> 18:53.001
SO SCREW IT.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.872
I KIND OF HAD
SOME RARE REACTION,

18:54.916 --> 18:56.439
LANDED ME
IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.485
IT WASN'T
LIFE-THREATENING,

18:58.528 --> 19:02.924
BUT THE SHAME,
THAT NEARLY KILLED ME,

19:02.967 --> 19:04.752
AND IN THAT MOMENT,
I REALIZED

19:04.795 --> 19:06.188
YOUR SISTER WAS RIGHT.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.147
OH, MARCUS.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.760
I COULDN'T FACE YOU

19:12.803 --> 19:15.763
KNOWING THAT
I LET YOU DOWN.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.548
I LET MYSELF DOWN,

19:18.592 --> 19:22.335
THE INTEGRITY
OF MY SPORT.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.859
IT WAS TOO MUCH,
SO I QUIT,

19:24.902 --> 19:28.210
AND THEN THE TEAM RAN
THIS INJURY STORY

19:28.254 --> 19:31.605
TO PROTECT
OUR REPUTATION,

19:31.648 --> 19:34.216
AND I CAME HOME.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.263
AND ENDED THINGS
WITH ME.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
OK. THIS--

19:43.312 --> 19:45.706
ALL OF THIS IS A LOT.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.798
MARCUS,
THERE'S ONE THING

19:50.841 --> 19:53.540
I NEED YOU TO GET
LOUD AND CLEAR.

19:54.845 --> 19:58.197
YOU WERE
ALWAYS ENOUGH.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.853
YO, Y'ALL AIN'T READY FOR
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO THROW DOWN.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.464
COME ON.
LET'S GO, BABY...

20:04.507 --> 20:05.987
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:06.030 --> 20:07.249
UM, J.R.'s ACTUALLY GONNA
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.729
-YO, COME ON.
-LET'S GO.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.644
YO, YO, YO, YO,
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

20:10.687 --> 20:12.515
WHAT YOU WANT
FROM ME?

20:12.559 --> 20:14.561
LOOK. I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HURTING,

20:14.604 --> 20:16.084
AND I'M SORRY
THAT YOUR PARENTS

20:16.127 --> 20:17.694
ARE GETTING
A DIVORCE, BUT, J.R.--

20:17.738 --> 20:20.436
LOOK. MY FAMILY IS
WRECKED. MARRIAGE OVER.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.177
IS IT BECAUSE
OF THE BABY

20:22.221 --> 20:23.570
YOUR PARENTS MIGHT HAVE
GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION?

20:23.613 --> 20:24.614
DON'T KNOW, DIDN'T ASK.
DOESN'T MATTER.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.312
IT DOES MATTER, J.R.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.270
THIS IS YOUR FAMILY

20:28.314 --> 20:30.577
AND MAYBE DAMON'S
FAMILY, TOO.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.275
LOOK. DAMON'S REQUESTED
HIS ADOPTION RECORDS,

20:33.319 --> 20:35.277
AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
IT'S GONNA COME OUT

20:35.321 --> 20:36.974
IF YOU GUYS ARE RELATED,
AND IF HE FINDS OUT

20:37.018 --> 20:40.151
THAT YOU--
WE SUSPECTED THIS

20:40.195 --> 20:41.892
AND WE KEPT THIS
A SECRET FROM HIM--

20:41.936 --> 20:44.243
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE?

20:44.286 --> 20:47.898
YOU KNOW, IT ALWAYS
COMES BACK TO DAMON.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.944
OH, BABY, DO YOU MIND?

20:49.987 --> 20:51.859
THANK YOU.

20:51.902 --> 20:55.471
J.R., PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.864
IF YOU GET DRUG-TESTED,
YOU COULD LOSE

20:56.907 --> 20:58.909
YOUR NCAA ELIGIBILITY.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.303
LOOK. I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

21:01.347 --> 21:02.565
BUT I'M GOOD.

21:02.609 --> 21:03.740
♪ GET BACK, GET BACK

21:03.784 --> 21:04.959
♪ YEAH, I'MMA GET IT

21:05.002 --> 21:07.135
♪ GONNA BREAK YOU...

21:34.902 --> 21:37.034
JESSIE RAYMOND.

21:38.862 --> 21:43.258
UM, HEY, MR. RAYMOND,
IT'S DAMON, J.R.'s FRIEND.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.782
UH...

21:45.826 --> 21:48.350
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SON.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.221
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY
NOT MY PLACE,

21:50.265 --> 21:54.051
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT HE'S--

21:54.095 --> 21:56.924
HE'S HAVING
A PRETTY TOUGH TIME,

21:56.967 --> 21:59.405
SO MAYBE GIVE HIM A CALL.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.058
BYE.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.459
YOU READY FOR THIS?
THROW THAT LOSING CARD DOWN.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.200
THROW THAT DOWN. I'VE BEEN
WAITING ON YOU TO THROW.

22:12.243 --> 22:15.203
COME ON. COME ON. THROW
THAT LOSING CARD DOWN.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.987
UH! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.249
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.686
I TOLD YOU I WAS
GONNA WIN, BABY.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.209
TOLD YOU I WAS
GONNA WIN. COME ON.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.515
CELEBRATING LIKE HE WON
THE DAMN SUPER BOWL.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.646
WE TIED TWO GAMES
FOR TWO, FOOL.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.082
COME ON.
I GET IT.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.257
IT AIN'T GOOD
BEING HUMILIATED

22:26.301 --> 22:27.258
AROUND ALL THESE
GOOD FOLKS.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.043
OH! HA! OK.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.044
I THINK WE CAN MAKE THIS
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.698
TALK TO ME.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.873
YOU WIN NEXT HAND,
YOU GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.309
AH, BEEN WAITING
ON THIS ONE.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.745
HOW ABOUT THAT WEED
YOU GOT FROM EDDIE?

22:35.789 --> 22:37.399
DONE.
IT'S ALL YOURS,

22:37.443 --> 22:40.359
BUT IF I WIN, MM--

22:41.795 --> 22:43.536
IF I WIN, YOU STOP
ACTING LIKE A FOOL

22:43.579 --> 22:45.102
AND TALK
TO YOUR PARENTS

22:45.146 --> 22:47.148
BEFORE YOU TRASH
YOUR WHOLE DAMN LIFE.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.584
WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY?

22:48.628 --> 22:50.891
WHAT'S WRONG, HONEY?
AFRAID YOU'LL LOSE?

22:50.934 --> 22:53.459
LISTEN.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.200
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE,

22:56.244 --> 22:59.552
SO STAY OUT OF IT.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.612
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO
PREPARE FOR A PERFORMANCE.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.440
-KEISHA DIDN'T TELL YOU?
-TELL ME WHAT?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.050
SHE CALLED
THE VIDEO SHOOT OFF.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.530
WAIT. WHY?

23:21.574 --> 23:23.358
SAID THE TIME FRAME
WAS TOO TIGHT.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.012
IT'S TOO BAD, THOUGH,

23:25.055 --> 23:27.101
BECAUSE HER
CHOREOGRAPHY DOPE.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.758
HEY, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

23:31.801 --> 23:32.933
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.108
I FORGOT MY LAPTOP,
AND, NO,

23:34.151 --> 23:35.414
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.763
THEA--

23:36.806 --> 23:37.807
YOU KNOW, AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

23:37.851 --> 23:39.679
I ACTUALLY TRUSTED YOU,

23:39.722 --> 23:41.507
AND THE LAST THING I NEEDED
WAS TO GET A SEX ED. LESSON

23:41.550 --> 23:43.422
AND BE JUDGED BY
THE JOCKS AND WILINDA.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.771
I DOUBT THEY
WERE JUDGING YOU.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.468
YOU WEREN'T HERE,
WERE YOU?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.339
I GET IT.

23:48.383 --> 23:51.517
YOUR LIFE MUST BE SO EASY
WITH YOUR HANDSOME BOYFRIEND

23:51.560 --> 23:54.520
AND YOUR INSTANT BESTIES,
BUT IT SUCKS TO FEEL

23:54.563 --> 23:56.522
LIKE THE OUTSIDER
AND BE MOCKED FOR IT,

23:56.565 --> 23:59.525
NOT THAT YOU'D KNOW.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.703
-COME WITH ME.
-I DON'T TAKE ORDERS.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.661
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
WIN ANY GAME WE PLAY.

24:05.705 --> 24:09.012
LISTEN, Y'ALL.
Y'ALL, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.623
IS IT ABOUT J.R.?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.407
NO. THAT IS
A WHOLE OTHER MESS.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.104
OK. WELL, WHAT
DID SHE DO THIS TIME?

24:14.148 --> 24:15.628
WHATEVER. I AM OUT.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.065
I HAVE A SON.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.330
HIS NAME IS SHAY.

24:22.373 --> 24:27.466
HE'S 14 MONTHS, AND
I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH,

24:27.509 --> 24:30.817
WHICH IS WHY I PUT
HIM UP FOR ADOPTION.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.254
HIS ADOPTIVE PARENTS
ARE AMAZING,

24:33.297 --> 24:34.951
AND NEXT WEEK,

24:34.995 --> 24:36.736
THEY ARE BRINGING
SHAY HERE TO VISIT,

24:36.779 --> 24:39.695
SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE JUDGED

24:39.739 --> 24:41.305
OR TO MISS OUT
ON A NORMAL LIFE,

24:41.349 --> 24:42.872
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ON PEOPLE

24:42.916 --> 24:46.528
WHO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT YOU.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.620
LOOK. I KNOW I SHOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING

24:51.664 --> 24:53.230
A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT I JUST DIDN'T--

24:53.274 --> 24:54.536
OOH, PRAISE JESUS.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.668
THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.191
OH, MY GOD, YEAH.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.149
I ALMOST LET IT SLIP,
LIKE, A MILLION TIMES.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.847
WAIT. Y'ALL KNEW
THIS WHOLE TIME?

25:00.890 --> 25:01.978
HOW LONG?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.197
WEEKS.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.633
YOU SHOULD
BE CAREFUL

25:04.677 --> 25:06.548
WHO YOU LET BORROW
YOUR LAPTOP.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.202
LET ME TELL YOU,
SHAY'S DADDY

25:08.245 --> 25:10.465
SURE DOES SEND A LOT
OF TEXTS AND PICTURES.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.468
HE REALLY DOES.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.165
SO Y'ALL DON'T FEEL
NO TYPE OF WAY

25:15.209 --> 25:16.558
THAT I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING?

25:16.602 --> 25:18.168
UH-UH. NO. WE KNEW
THAT YOU'D TELL US

25:18.212 --> 25:19.561
WHEN YOU WERE READY.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.128
AND HERE WE ARE.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.826
YOU BETTER BELIEVE WE'RE
SPOILING SHAY ROTTEN

25:23.870 --> 25:25.480
WHEN HE
COMES TO TOWN.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.177
YOUR SON WON'T
KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.876
YOU HAVE A SON?

25:36.056 --> 25:38.798
DAMON...

25:40.103 --> 25:41.627
WAIT.

25:42.976 --> 25:47.458
DAMON, CAN YOU PLEASE
SAY SOMETHING?

25:51.027 --> 25:54.465
HUH. WHERE DO I
START, SIMONE?

25:54.509 --> 25:56.076
BECAUSE ALL THE TIME
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

25:56.119 --> 25:58.600
ABOUT MY ADOPTION,
AND, WHAT, YOU DON'T SAY

25:58.644 --> 26:00.994
NOTHING ABOUT THE BABY
THAT YOU GAVE UP?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.996
WELL, WHEN WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT,

26:03.039 --> 26:04.606
WHEN YOU WERE
JUDGING WHAT KIND OF

26:04.650 --> 26:06.739
MESSED-UP MOMS
GIVE UP THEIR BABIES?

26:06.782 --> 26:09.393
THAT--
THAT WASN'T ABOUT YOU.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.787
WELL, IT FELT
PERSONAL.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.314
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT...

26:18.881 --> 26:21.275
DANE AND I, WE WEREN'T
EVEN REALLY TOGETHER.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.451
-SIMONE, HOLD UP.
-NO. LET ME EXPLAIN, DAMON.

26:23.494 --> 26:27.455
SIMONE, YOU DON'T
NEED TO. LISTEN.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.239
FOR YOU TO GIVE UP
YOUR SON--

26:29.283 --> 26:31.677
HIS NAME IS SHAY.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.246
FOR YOU TO GIVE UP SHAY,
THAT TOOK COURAGE.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.729
I KNOW YOU.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.513
I KNOW YOUR HEART,
AND I KNOW THAT YOU

26:42.557 --> 26:45.516
MUST HAVE HAD
A REALLY GOOD REASON.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.606
I KNOW THAT YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

26:47.649 --> 26:51.044
IF LOVE
WASN'T INVOLVED.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.655
THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO KNOW.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.964
OH...

27:04.448 --> 27:08.452
SO ARE THEY ANY MORE
DEEP, DARK SECRETS

27:08.496 --> 27:11.673
THAT I NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT?

27:11.717 --> 27:14.154
THAT WAS A JOKE.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.419
DAMON...

27:18.462 --> 27:20.551
WHAT'S UP?

27:20.595 --> 27:23.293
UM...

27:23.337 --> 27:26.122
THERE'S A...

27:26.166 --> 27:28.255
POSSIBILITY
THAT YOU AND J.R.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.778
COULD BE BROTHERS.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.432
-WHAT?
-LOOK.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.739
I KNOW THERE'S
A LOT TO EXPLAIN,

27:33.782 --> 27:38.961
BUT, UM, DAMON--

27:57.588 --> 27:59.765
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.331
UH!

28:01.375 --> 28:03.682
JUST MAKING THE BEST
OUT OF A CRAPPY SITUATION.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.335
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE FANCY DATE FOOD

28:05.379 --> 28:07.381
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE, BUT IT'S FOOD.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.731
YEAH, KIND OF, RIGHT?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.733
THIS IS SWEET,
MARCUS.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.910
THANK YOU,
BUT THERE IS NO WAY

28:14.954 --> 28:16.912
I'M EATING ON THIS
NASTY-ASS GYM FLOOR.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.827
TRUE THAT, TRUE THAT,
SO I'M GONNA--

28:18.871 --> 28:21.134
I'LL HELP YOU BRING IT
IN THE OFFICE.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.962
MARCUS...

28:23.005 --> 28:26.052
[DESI VALENTINE'S "BEST OF ME"
PLAYING ON SOUNDTRACK]

28:26.095 --> 28:28.445
I REALLY AM SORRY

28:28.489 --> 28:31.144
MY SISTER
GOT IN YOUR HEAD.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.972
LOOK. HONESTLY,
GOING THROUGH ALL THAT

28:33.015 --> 28:35.539
IN THE MINORS
MADE ME THE MAN

28:35.583 --> 28:37.498
AND COACH I AM TODAY.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.370
I WOULDN'T CHANGE
THAT PART.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.069
NOW, THE HURTING-YOU PART...

28:43.112 --> 28:45.332
♪ PULLED MYSELF UP...

28:45.375 --> 28:47.290

WAS FLAWLESS,

30:26.912 --> 30:28.739
AFTER HAVING A BABY.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.307
I THOUGHT,
"SERENA COULD DO IT,

J.R.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.227
HE'S WORRIED
ABOUT YOU. CALL ME BACK.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.011
WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.752
YOU CALLED MY DAD?

34:18.795 --> 34:20.101
SO WAS YOU EVER
GONNA MENTION

34:20.145 --> 34:21.711
THAT WE MIGHT
BE BROTHERS,

34:21.755 --> 34:22.843
OR WAS YOU
GONNA KEEP ACTING

34:22.886 --> 34:25.019
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH?

34:26.934 --> 34:29.110
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT WAS TRUE.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.330
HEH. YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

THIS COULD BE ANYBODY.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.911

THE SIMILAR SCAR?

34:47.955 --> 34:49.217
BECAUSE
ME AND SIMONE

34:49.261 --> 34:50.697
ALREADY WENT
DOWN THAT PATH.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.264
FOR A SECOND,
SHE THOUGHT

34:52.307 --> 34:53.526
COACH MARCUS AND AMARA
WAS YOUR PARENTS,

34:53.569 --> 34:55.136
MAKING YOU
TWO COUSINS.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.659
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN WHISPERING ABOUT.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.574
JUST THEORIES,
MAN, CRAZY ONES.

34:58.618 --> 34:59.967
YES, YES, YES.
THEY ARE.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.621

THEY'RE THEORIES

35:01.664 --> 35:03.362
ABOUT MY LIFE, J.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.841
WHAT, YOU TWO ALL
JUST PLAYING GOD

35:04.885 --> 35:06.843

35:10.020 --> 35:11.805
I WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING

35:11.848 --> 35:14.764
ABOUT THE DIVORCE,
WHY YOUR PARENTS SPLITTING.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.940
IS IT--IS IT
BECAUSE OF ME?

35:16.984 --> 35:18.464
IT'S BECAUSE
OF THIS?

35:18.507 --> 35:20.161
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU, DAMON.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.337
MY PARENTS SPLITTING
IS FAMILY BUSINESS.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.992
YOU AREN'T FAMILY.
LISTEN.

35:25.035 --> 35:29.083
I DON'T HAVE, WANT,
OR NEED A BROTHER.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.175
THAT'S FINE.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.222
GOT HERE BY MYSELF.
I DON'T NEED NOBODY.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.288
DAMON,
PLEASE JUST CALL ME.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.637
I PROMISE I W--

36:03.596 --> 36:07.600
HEY, UM, I JUST
LEFT YOU A VOICEMAIL.

36:10.951 --> 36:14.259
HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT ME AND J.R.?

36:15.477 --> 36:17.914
SINCE
THEA'S BIRTHDAY.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.960
BUT WHEN I MET YOU,
I TOLD YOU

36:20.003 --> 36:21.483
THAT I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR MY BIRTH PARENTS.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.137
I KNOW, DAMON,

36:23.181 --> 36:25.357
AND THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL YOU.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.272
INSTEAD, YOU AND J.R.
JUST DECIDED

36:27.315 --> 36:28.838
WHAT WAS
BEST FOR MY LIFE

36:28.882 --> 36:30.492
AND THEN PLAYED ME
WHEN MY GUT TOLD ME

36:30.536 --> 36:32.277
THERE WAS SOMETHING UP
WITH YOU TWO.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.543

IT'S USUALLY DINNER

36:49.816 --> 36:52.166

36:52.210 --> 36:54.951
WE'RE GROWN, MARCUS.
YOU CAN SAY SEX.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.344

37:04.961 --> 37:07.703

40:37.522 --> 40:39.654
ASK WHAT NEEDS
TO BE ASKED

40:39.698 --> 40:41.656
OR TRASH YOUR FUTURE

40:41.700 --> 40:43.397
BUT BOTH
ARE A CHOICE.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.964

40:50.099 --> 40:54.016
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,
IT'S GONNA SUCK

40:54.060 --> 40:56.279
UNTIL IT DOESN'T.

40:56.323 --> 40:59.326
I GOT CLASS,
BUT IF YOU EVER NEED

40:59.369 --> 41:01.110
NATE'S WISE WORDS

41:01.154 --> 41:03.112

GET YOUR BUTT WHUPPED

41:03.156 --> 41:05.419
IN SPADES AGAIN,

41:05.463 --> 41:07.290

41:07.334 --> 41:08.683
YOU CHEATING AT SPADES.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.120

AT NO KIND OF SPADES.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.601
-HAVE A GOOD CLASS.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.571
