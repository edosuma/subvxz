WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.033 --> 00:13.800
Let this motherfucker party
begin!

00:13.867 --> 00:16.733
This time we are back
where we belong...

00:17.967 --> 00:19.067
Newcastle.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.800
With our friends...

00:21.867 --> 00:22.867
And family.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.633
Yoo-hoo!
Nana!

00:26.700 --> 00:28.700
Doing the things we love.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.233
There'll be some new faces.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.733
Hello!

00:34.800 --> 00:36.767
Plenty of old faces.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.033
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:39.100 --> 00:41.633
And one big blast from the past.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.333
Long-time, no fuckin' see.
(others cheer)

00:44.400 --> 00:45.800
(screaming)

00:45.867 --> 00:47.533
But don't worry.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.333
We're still proper radge.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.233
Which means getting inebriated.

00:53.633 --> 00:54.900
You mean mortal.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.367
Lots of fornication.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.933
Shagging, you divvy.

01:02.467 --> 01:03.867
Hello!

01:03.933 --> 01:05.467
And lots, and lots of mayhem.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.867
(wails)

01:06.933 --> 01:08.367
(screams)

01:08.433 --> 01:09.900
(screams)

01:09.967 --> 01:12.467
Fuck off, now!

01:19.700 --> 01:21.233
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

01:21.300 --> 01:22.567
(cheering)

01:22.633 --> 01:24.167
It's going to be pure fuckin'
belta.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.700
(yells)

01:27.500 --> 01:29.600
I wanna do more girls trips,
yous.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.867
Chloe, you were the best.
Hopefully
we'll get the old Chloe back.

01:32.933 --> 01:36.733
Say bye bye to Scotty T
and hello to Scotty Tree.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.200
It really hurt me fanny.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.767
What the fuck was that about?

01:44.067 --> 01:45.500
I need to go in on him.

01:45.567 --> 01:46.833
I've had a fight with him.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.400
I just wish sometimes
Sophie wouldn't get involved.

01:49.467 --> 01:50.600
Sam, stop it!

01:50.667 --> 01:53.000
The only way we're going to sort
it
is getting away.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.767
Chloe, you're mad.

01:54.833 --> 01:57.200
Soph. This family is falling
apart.

01:57.267 --> 01:58.867
How many times is this going
to happen?

01:58.933 --> 02:00.867
I don't think it'll happen
again.
Yeah.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.867
Tonight has been too much for
me.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.032
I'm fucked.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.500
Go on, go to bed.
I am, I'm goin' to fuckin' bed.

02:10.567 --> 02:13.367
She's just pied us. I need to
cool
things off before I get hurt.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.100
I'm totally crackers, me like.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.100
I'm preened to perfection.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.033
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.033
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.833
I can talk the blacklegs off
a donkey.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.867
I'm happy go lucky, bit of a
Jack
the Lad. That's me to a T.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.500
I'm fake, I'm flirty,
and I've got double F's.

02:33.567 --> 02:36.233
What you see is what you get,
bags of fun.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.133
I cannae believe anyone would
put me
in charge of this lot.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.400
Geordie Shore, wey aye!

02:59.700 --> 03:01.600
I'm fucked.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.700
Nathan, it's the worst I've
fuckin'
felt like, I'm fuckin dying,
mate.

03:05.767 --> 03:09.433
I've woken up this morning, it's
only
me and Adam in the boy's
bedroom.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.667
That's the first time
Sam's slept with the girls.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.333
I had an argument with Faith.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.667
Did you? Last night?

03:14.733 --> 03:16.533
We sorted it out
when we got back.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.867
Last night, I let Faith know how
her
crawling into a shell makes us
feel.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.600
Sometimes you've got to be cruel
to be kind.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.967
I sat down and said
you're not leaving this house.

03:26.033 --> 03:28.200
You're here,
you're part of this family,

03:28.267 --> 03:29.833
fuckin' be part of this family.

03:29.900 --> 03:33.033
She always sayin' she fittin' in
but then she's dancing on her
own,

03:33.100 --> 03:35.167
like I do feel for her a bit
but like,

03:35.233 --> 03:37.500
but it's her choice, mate, isn't
it?

03:37.567 --> 03:39.267
It is but it's a reflection on
us.

03:39.333 --> 03:42.700
Me and Abbie want Faith
to get back into the family

03:42.767 --> 03:46.300
so we're going to make sure
she's
getting involved and having fun.

03:46.367 --> 03:50.033
I'm surprised you are in this
room.
I thought you were going with
Abbie.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.100
Nah, not last night mate.

03:52.167 --> 03:55.267
Abbie's still giving me mixed
messages after last night.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.767
I need to stop this
before I get fucked over.

03:57.833 --> 04:00.533
If I'm honest, I feel like
I'm pissin' in the wind.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.933
It did seem like you were
fighting
a losing battle, I don't blame
ya.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.633
It's fuckin' pointless, so...

04:09.633 --> 04:11.267
(hoarsely) I'm ill today.

04:12.433 --> 04:13.967
I'm fucking ill.

04:14.033 --> 04:17.600
Oh, my God, I am more hangin'
than a badger's arsehole.

04:17.666 --> 04:18.899
I'm so hungover.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.233
Even though I'm hanging out
me back tits,

04:21.300 --> 04:22.733
I'm buzzin' you and Sam made up.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.300
Chloe, you and him are always
going to be all right.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.733
You're always going to make up,
what's the point me being
involved?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.200
Things are never going to
change.

04:30.267 --> 04:34.967
I don't trust Sam 100% but I'm
glad
we've sorted out our
differences.

04:35.033 --> 04:38.933
Abbie, I bet you've had a good
sleep
by yourself last night. I have.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.067
Without Adam.

04:40.133 --> 04:44.667
I've seen last night, he was
tryin'
his hardest to get in your bed.

04:44.733 --> 04:46.067
He obviously likes ya.

04:46.133 --> 04:50.000
When he does do stuff like that
I just feel awkward.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.867
I'm in a really difficult
position.

04:51.933 --> 04:55.100
I don't want to hurt Adam's
feelings
but I don't want to lead him on.

04:55.167 --> 04:56.200
You and Nathan?

04:56.267 --> 04:59.833
Nathan was kinda going on about
how
he doesn't feel I'm being
meself.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.933
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.167
Nathan did go in on us
a little bit last night,

05:04.233 --> 05:06.367
but I do think he has
my best interests at heart.

05:06.433 --> 05:10.333
I'm very much, put a brave face
on,
independent, like, keep it all
in.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.733
In this house when you keep it
in
and you don't tell people,

05:13.800 --> 05:15.033
it comes out in drink.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.567
Last night, Nathan went
in pretty hard on Faith,

05:17.633 --> 05:19.800
but he was doing it
for the right reasons.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.967
We just want that orange
ball of energy

05:22.033 --> 05:23.800
who arrived on her first day
back.

05:23.867 --> 05:26.000
I feel embarrassed that I got
into that state.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.867
Don't ever feel embarrassed.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.633
Especially in front of me,

05:29.700 --> 05:32.667
you should see some of the
states
that I've got in.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.200
I was a right freak.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.100
Glorious, glorious day.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.900
I have actually missed my rat
babies.

05:40.967 --> 05:43.633
I need to go and check on
Donald Trump and Theresa May.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.367
Feed them some chocolate chips.

05:45.433 --> 05:48.533
Good girl, Theresa. I can't
believe
how good you are with kids.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.467
That's right Sam, I am very good
with kids and I am mature,

05:52.533 --> 05:53.967
that's why I'm wife material.

05:54.033 --> 05:56.867
Can you believe how good
of a night last night was?

05:56.933 --> 06:00.500
Sam and Sophie making up last
night
has made me feel so much better.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.400
I hate being torn between me
boyfriend and me best friend.

06:03.467 --> 06:06.333
I said, look, if I've ever done
anything to piss you off,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.500
I'm sorry for that.
She said, I'm the exact same.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.800
Chloe thinks that everything
is sorted between me and Sophie.

06:12.867 --> 06:14.833
But I'm not 100% sure
that it is.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.033
She needs to stay out
of our business.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.433
I'll tell you one thing, I'm
fucking
hanging like a coat hanger.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.033
Me and Sam have been
such good parents,

06:23.100 --> 06:24.167
but I need some scran.

06:28.567 --> 06:32.267
Get your stuff on, we're ganning
for fuckin' brekkie. Tell the
girls!

06:32.333 --> 06:35.667
Girls, girls, girls, we are
going
to go for some greasy breakfast

06:35.733 --> 06:36.900
to sort our hangover out.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.033
I'm going to stay in bed.
Are you jokin'?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.367
Faith, I'll keep you company
and I'll stay.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.467
Oh thanks, babe.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.800
I can see that Faith isn't
feeling
too great after last night,

06:45.867 --> 06:49.067
so I'm going to skip the greasy
spoon and make sure that she's
ok.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.833
Ah, look at this,
this is a good table yous.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.800
There is nothing better
to sort out the hangover,

07:00.867 --> 07:03.700
I cannot wait for my full
English.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.167
Here it is!
(they cheer)

07:07.700 --> 07:09.433
No black pudding?
No black pudding.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.233
That is a sexy, sexy breakfast
that is.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.900
I've no time for cutlery,
using me fuckin' fingers.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.333
Why's Abbie not here?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.067
She's staying in with Faith.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.000
I think with Abbie, Abbie's been
there, do you know what I mean?

07:22.067 --> 07:25.433
When Abbie first started here,
she was a bit quiet and stuff.

07:25.500 --> 07:29.467
Let's make a pact right now,
to make Faith feel more welcome

07:29.533 --> 07:31.867
so she can be honest, be
herself.

07:31.933 --> 07:35.033
I hope my chat with Faith
helped her turn a corner,

07:35.100 --> 07:37.633
now we need to make sure
she's getting involved

07:37.700 --> 07:40.033
and having fun
cos that's what we all want.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.200
(farts)

07:41.267 --> 07:44.267
Oh, Nathan! Nathan, I think you
need
to go to the toilet.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.500
Urgh!

07:45.567 --> 07:47.933
Fuckin' poo particles
flying everywhere.

07:48.033 --> 07:51.767
Fuckin' hell, Nathan, that has
put
me right off my sausage.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.800
Let's get out of here.
Thank you, Shirley!

07:53.867 --> 07:57.233
Bye! See you again.
Take care. Yous too.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.433
Do you fancy a veggie breakfast?

08:05.500 --> 08:08.033
I've actually never had one
of them in me life.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.533
Should we do it then?
Should we try it? What is it?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.300
So we've got bacon and sausage.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.933
I've never seen this
before in my life.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.833
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.733
I am feeling a bit down today
and it has got to us a little
bit.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.833
So far Faith has had run-ins
with Chloe and Nathan

08:23.900 --> 08:27.367
and they are both big
characters,
but they don't mean any harm,

08:27.433 --> 08:29.900
so Faith should not
take it personally.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.167
People who have been here for a
while

08:32.232 --> 08:34.600
forget what it's like
when you're new. Yeah.

08:34.667 --> 08:38.667
Sometimes I felt like, I don't
know
if I can do this, this is too
hard.

08:38.732 --> 08:40.366
I am complex and I don't know

08:40.433 --> 08:42.667
whether the others
will ever fully get us.

08:42.732 --> 08:45.833
Now I know Abbie's got me back,
I
think everything is going to be
OK.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.100
I'm going to make sure now like
after this

08:48.167 --> 08:50.433
that the family
does make more of an effort

08:50.500 --> 08:51.633
and makes sure you're OK.

09:00.467 --> 09:01.467
Stuffed now.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.000
Hi, girls.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.733
Hello.
You all right?

09:06.667 --> 09:10.467
We've had a banging breakfast
and
there's no sign of a call from
Anna,

09:10.533 --> 09:14.367
which means we get to have
a chill out day. Get in.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.833
Woo!

09:25.367 --> 09:26.400
(he chuckles)

09:27.400 --> 09:28.433
Oh, I love it!

09:31.567 --> 09:33.000
Oh, I love that one!

09:43.600 --> 09:46.600
Today's been great because
we've done absolutely fuck all,

09:46.667 --> 09:48.500
but tonight is gonna gan off.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.733
Ooh. Good one.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.967
Everything I've done
recently has backfired,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.533
but you can't keep me down.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.833
I'm going to go out and remind
everyone Faith knows how to
party.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.600
Fuckin' hell your tits look
massive
like that.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.500
It looks like my fuckin' bum.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.667
If I was a lad I would fuckin'
go shag your tits me. Lads hate
them.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.467
I'd fuckin' pay for tits like
ye.
You should be grateful.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.200
You and Adam been chattin' a
lot?

10:18.267 --> 10:20.233
Nah, I put a stop on it.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.033
What, you lost a friendship?

10:22.100 --> 10:25.833
I don't know, there's like,
things
I told him not to get in me bed.

10:25.900 --> 10:29.033
You're starting to feel a little
bit
in control now aren't ya?

10:29.100 --> 10:30.267
You see him as a friend.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.767
I hate to say it Abbie but
you've got
yourself into a right pickle
like.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.100
I love pickles, me.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.600
He's never had feelings for a
girl
before, he told us,

10:37.667 --> 10:40.100
I think Abbie is the first girl
he's actually liked.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.867
Me and you look very colourful.
We do, mate.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.333
Give us your zebra impression.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.800
(whinnies)

10:51.867 --> 10:54.400
That's a fuckin horse,
you daft fuck. A zebra is a
horse.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.433
Judging by what we're wearing,
the lads are out on the prowl.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.100
Look at the colour of his tan.
I'd probably say you were
mahogany.

11:01.167 --> 11:04.267
If I'm being honest right,
you need a tiny bit more on.

11:04.333 --> 11:09.600
I thought Faith had an awful tan
until Adam decided he liked tan
too.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.967
The boy looks like
a fuckin' oompa lumpa.

11:12.033 --> 11:13.833
You've just said I look
mahogany.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.700
Your arms are, your chest isn't.

11:15.767 --> 11:19.933
I think he needs a little more
fake
tan. I can help you out mate.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.667
Nay way your puttin' that on.
Fuck that.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.900
Quickly before it goes funny.
On his neck.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.967
Do it up me neck and that first.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.467
What are ya doin'? Are you mad?

11:29.533 --> 11:32.867
Please. Close your eyes.
Lean into it. The forehead.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.400
Close your eyes then.
I am! Close your eyes!

11:35.467 --> 11:38.267
If you don't let him do it,
it's going to dry.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.733
It's going to dry quickly.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.000
Over his eyes, Sam, over his
eyes.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.400
And around his mouth
and over his nose.

11:44.467 --> 11:47.767
I've seen Chloe do this fake
tanning
stuff all the time,

11:47.833 --> 11:49.167
so I should be an expert.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.667
Whack some on me cock if you
want
Samuel, darling.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.033
I'd never do that to ya.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.400
(laughs)

11:54.467 --> 11:56.733
I'm sure you wouldn't
you little bastard.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.900
What the fuck have you done
to me, Sam?

11:58.967 --> 12:00.967
You can fuck off, you stupid
cunt.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.933
(laughter)

12:04.800 --> 12:08.400
I can't believe what those
pricks
have done, I look like a right
twat.

12:08.467 --> 12:11.333
He looked fuckin' stupid.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.300
Fancy lettin' me do that,
who would let me fake tan them?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.833
Come on then, girls!

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
(all yell)

12:31.533 --> 12:32.867
Who's are these?
Dunno.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.067
Urgh. Not yours?

12:35.133 --> 12:37.733
I look like a nectarine
but fuck it,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.300
let's get out and get mortal.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.267
Everyone, cheers for tonight.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.600
(all) Cheers!

12:42.667 --> 12:44.633
Let's make it a good 'un, right?

12:50.633 --> 12:53.600
Faith is on one tonight.

12:53.667 --> 12:54.667
Woo!

12:56.367 --> 12:58.700
I've popped a bean bag.
Christmas!

12:59.533 --> 13:02.300
Bloody beans get everywhere.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.467
Geordie Shore, wey aye.

13:09.033 --> 13:09.233
.

13:11.700 --> 13:11.900
.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.700
I'm excited for tonight.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.100
Can't wait.

13:23.167 --> 13:26.733
The family are in a good place.
Sophie and Sam are mates again.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.833
Tonight could be
a good old Geordie night out.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.333
Here's to no agg.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.133
Woo!

13:35.200 --> 13:37.000
After a good day,

13:37.067 --> 13:39.633
I'm feeling so up
for a fun one tonight.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.233
It's time to get me some drinks.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.133
(loud dance music throughout)

14:02.800 --> 14:04.600
I'm feeling so much better
today.

14:04.667 --> 14:08.233
I'm not letting anything
get in the way of a wicked
night.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.067
Faith is on one tonight.

14:13.133 --> 14:16.500
It looks like my chat helped her
come out of her shell.

14:16.567 --> 14:17.900
Woo!

14:31.167 --> 14:33.100
I'm happy for Sam to have a chat
with Abbie

14:33.167 --> 14:36.300
cos I'm still confused as to
what's
going on, so it's worth a shot.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.533
Yeah.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.600
I've patched things up with Sam,

15:02.667 --> 15:05.567
but I don't see all roses
in their relationship,

15:05.633 --> 15:06.867
but we'll see.

15:22.667 --> 15:26.700
Us girls have seen no action
and I can't remember the last
time

15:26.767 --> 15:28.733
I've seen anything
that resembled a willy.

15:31.733 --> 15:35.200
It's time like this when I wish
I did fancy Adam.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.400
Right.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.867
Leading him on? Come on, Sam,
Adam is a big lad,

16:04.933 --> 16:06.567
he can handle a bit of flirting.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.400
I thought that I made things
clear to Adam.

16:14.467 --> 16:18.500
We're just friends, so why is he
telling Sam that he's confused?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.633
Abbie, if you're letting a lad
into your bed

16:29.700 --> 16:31.867
that kind of gives mixed
signals.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.467
I'll admit I have enjoyed
having the attention off Adam

16:42.533 --> 16:45.333
but if he's got a problem,
he needs to speak to me about
it,

16:45.400 --> 16:48.000
not send his friend over,
he's not ten.

16:59.367 --> 17:00.367
Woo!

17:05.200 --> 17:09.267
Chatting to Abbie, I think it's
clear
that Adam has got no fuckin'
chance.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.933
Time to put him out of his
misery.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.500
Don't get us wrong Sam,
I love spending time with ya

17:21.567 --> 17:24.467
but honest, I'd rather be
spending time with Abbie in bed.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.933
It's time for us to crack out
the moves

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and have a little family dance
off.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.267
Boom.

17:55.467 --> 17:59.167
There's nothing like a dance off
to bring the family together.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.700
Howay Faith, show us
what you've got.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.833
Go on Faith, get it, girl.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.700
Woah!

18:11.767 --> 18:13.300
Beat that!

18:15.333 --> 18:17.967
I am throwing out my best moves
for this one.

18:33.700 --> 18:38.033
Kebab, kebab, kebab, kebab.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.367
Time for some scran.
Get in my mouth, kebab.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.767
Oh, I'm so excited for this.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.533
It's dirty. You don't get a body
like mine by eating that.

18:47.367 --> 18:50.067
This is what's called
a Geordie kebab. Oh, yeah.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.833
A Geordie delight.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.700
Thank fuck for kebab.
I'm as happy as a pig in shit.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.533
Good night, it's all mine.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.167
Oh, my God, I must have had
that much kebab,

19:06.233 --> 19:08.267
I've bastard popped the bean
bag!

19:08.333 --> 19:10.400
It's Christmas!

19:10.467 --> 19:13.500
Fuck this, I'm chuckin' it
off the balcony. I'm having fun!

19:13.567 --> 19:15.267
It's Christmas!

19:15.333 --> 19:18.100
Oh, this is gonna get messy.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.667
You fuckin' die!

19:22.067 --> 19:24.200
If yous want to put white balls
in my bedroom,

19:24.267 --> 19:25.833
I'm going to put it in yours
too.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.333
No!

19:27.400 --> 19:30.167
Happy Christmas, bitch!
It's my bed!

19:30.233 --> 19:32.333
Abbie, you best find
a new fucking bed.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.367
Boys stop her, she's about to
ruin our bedroom.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.900
I think it's only fair we take
these balls up to the lads'
room.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.467
I've just swallowed a load of
balls!

19:42.533 --> 19:45.467
Those little radgies aren't
getting
into the boys room.

19:45.533 --> 19:47.000
Thou shall not pass!

19:47.067 --> 19:49.067
Get out! Get out!

19:49.133 --> 19:50.233
Get out!

19:50.300 --> 19:52.267
Get down the stairs.
Het out!

19:52.333 --> 19:54.133
Get out, now!

19:54.200 --> 19:56.067
Out! Out!

19:56.133 --> 19:57.433
Out!

19:57.500 --> 19:58.867
(screams)

19:58.933 --> 20:00.900
Ow, that really hurt.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.167
This is chaos, I feel like
I'm in the north pole

20:03.233 --> 20:06.967
and I'm bloody gagging
on bastard bean bag balls!

20:08.967 --> 20:10.267
(yelling)

20:13.433 --> 20:15.367
Let it snow, bitches.

20:15.433 --> 20:17.133
Yeah!

20:17.200 --> 20:18.433
Yeah, bitches!

20:18.500 --> 20:19.900
Sophie with her hairdryer

20:19.967 --> 20:22.100
is making this house look like
a fucking snow globe.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.900
White balls in your arse.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
(laughing)

20:27.667 --> 20:29.667
Make a snow angel!
OK.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.667
Faith, can I just ask
one thing tonight?

20:36.733 --> 20:37.733
No snoring, love.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.633
Me boobs are too big that me
chest
gets squashed.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.133
Is that why? Because your tits
are that big.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.200
If I'm lying on the side, like
right
now, I'm struggling to breath.

20:46.267 --> 20:48.067
Right, lay on your back
then, love.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.733
Faith has had a much more
positive
day today,

20:50.800 --> 20:53.300
especially after all of
last night's drama.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.000
I just hope she doesn't snore
like a rhino again.

20:56.067 --> 20:59.700
I like to go to sleep before
you.
Good night.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.200
Sleep tight.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.000
Sit down.

21:05.967 --> 21:09.300
The bedroom is full of beans.
It's calling our name though.

21:09.367 --> 21:12.200
I am literally full of beans.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.133
As always.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.833
I just think we should... Oh, my
God
they are in my arsehole. Go to
bed.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.767
Howay, I'll have a check.
No, I'm...

21:20.833 --> 21:22.400
Can I have a check?
If you want to.

21:22.467 --> 21:25.600
These bloody beads get
everywhere.

21:25.667 --> 21:26.767
Bend over.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.667
Right, wait there because I
haven't
wiped me bum for a while.

21:29.733 --> 21:32.233
Oh, my God, Adam,
they're on my balls. Bum hole.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.300
Oh, my God.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.633
Pull out your asshole,
it's in your sphincter.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.133
(farts)

21:37.200 --> 21:39.700
(laughter)

21:39.767 --> 21:42.700
That boy has got
some serious fucking issues.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.467
I told you I was full of beans.

21:44.533 --> 21:47.600
Fuckin' smell that,
it's like a fuckin' otters
pocket.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.433
Being with this lot
makes me so happy.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.533
Howay, it's time to get some
sleep.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.000
Party crew!
Fuckin' hell.

22:06.067 --> 22:07.433
Taking a big fuckin' tank out.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.000
Scotty T and tanks,
what a fuckin' belter.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.700
(yelling)

22:11.767 --> 22:13.133
Tonight is a bestie night.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.267
To the fuckin' wicked night!

22:15.967 --> 22:18.067
Geordie Shore, wey aye.

22:20.500 --> 22:20.700
.

22:23.200 --> 22:23.400
.

22:46.167 --> 22:48.733
Right yous, I'm fucked.
So am I.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.733
My head is absolutely banging,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.200
I feel like I've gone ten rounds
with Anthony Joshua.

22:53.267 --> 22:55.300
I'm hungover like and knackered.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.000
I'm knackered like.

22:57.067 --> 22:59.633
I've woke up to a room
covered in balls

22:59.700 --> 23:01.567
and not the type of balls
that I like.

23:01.633 --> 23:03.433
I am not clearing this mess up.

23:03.500 --> 23:07.100
I'm not touching a single bean,
or whatever they are called.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.433
Mornin' everyone.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.833
Mornin'.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.700
I can't even open me eyes.

23:15.767 --> 23:18.833
I am absolutely hanging
this morning. What happened?

23:18.900 --> 23:22.133
I had to sleep in this bed
because
mine is covered in fuckin'
balls.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.367
Maybe last night
wasn't such a good idea.

23:24.433 --> 23:27.000
I don't understand
how we're going to clean it off.

23:27.067 --> 23:28.100
Hello.
Hello.

23:28.167 --> 23:29.833
Fuck, it's like an igloo in
here.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.567
How's you and Adam then, Abbie?

23:31.633 --> 23:34.533
Sam was just saying that he
thinks
that I'm leading him on.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.067
How on earth am I leading him
on?

23:36.133 --> 23:39.067
If you were, the other night you
would have let him in your bed.

23:39.133 --> 23:41.000
Exactly and I didn't.

23:41.067 --> 23:43.300
Sam saying that I'm giving Adam
mixed signals

23:43.367 --> 23:44.800
has really pissed me off.

23:44.867 --> 23:46.800
I haven't done anything wrong.

23:46.867 --> 23:49.267
I've always said that me and
Adam
are friends,

23:49.333 --> 23:50.767
what is there not to get?

23:52.033 --> 23:53.967
Oh no, not in the direction
of my case.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.733
It's in my vagina, you know.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.400
I went to the toilet
and it popped out of me vagina.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.400
How we gonna cook?

24:02.467 --> 24:04.167
Like this.

24:04.233 --> 24:05.867
Ah, we need to wash it.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.167
(coughs)

24:11.233 --> 24:14.767
It's far too early to be gagging
on balls, even for me.

24:14.833 --> 24:17.433
Come on, you've got to be
faster than this.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.933
That's my egg,
that's a perfect one there.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.267
Guys, eggs on toast!

24:25.433 --> 24:26.700
That's yours, Sam.

24:26.767 --> 24:27.900
Girls, breakfast.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.000
Christmas really has came early.

24:31.067 --> 24:33.900
I love our new snowy decor
but whoever's cleaning it up

24:33.967 --> 24:36.333
better get to it
before Anna and Scott arrive.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.633
They'll be so mad.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.867
I'm starvin'.
Abbie, yours is there.

24:39.933 --> 24:41.833
Which one's mine?
That one there.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.633
This sandwich is shit.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.933
You're fuckin' ungrateful
swines,
tell you what, all of yous.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.900
Sit here, Chloe dog.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.500
Party crew!
Fuckin' hell.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.767
It's only Scotty T,
Anna's hugely important,

25:03.833 --> 25:07.200
proper smart fuckin' seriously
good
lookin' assistant,

25:07.267 --> 25:09.900
really to dish out another
Geor-day Tour.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.433
What the fuck is going on here?
Has it been snowing?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.333
I love Scott, and the way
that he bounces in,

25:15.400 --> 25:19.000
but when he's here, that means
that
one of us is going to work.

25:19.067 --> 25:20.567
Please don't pick me.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.167
Where'd yous two go last time?

25:22.233 --> 25:24.800
Day off, mate.
You fucks. Day off?

25:24.867 --> 25:26.900
We had a few problems.
What am I gonna tell Anna?

25:26.967 --> 25:29.200
We're really sorry about it,
aren't we?

25:29.267 --> 25:33.133
Well, that's yous two working
today
cos you missed it last time.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.533
That will teach me
to keep me mouth shut.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.700
And obviously
we're taking Nathan too.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.733
Even though having to work
sucks,

25:41.800 --> 25:44.800
I'm excited because this is
the first time me and Chloe

25:44.867 --> 25:46.833
will be workin' together
since we got back.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.633
Do you wanna know our day?

25:48.700 --> 25:52.700
Basically, we're taking a big
fuckin' tank out and drivin' it.

25:52.767 --> 25:54.833
Who could think of an idea
like that?

25:54.900 --> 25:57.200
Only Scotty T.
Scotty T and tanks.

25:57.267 --> 25:59.233
What a fuckin' belter.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.833
An army tank?
An army tank.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.833
For fuck sake man, I don't want
to go an drive a fuckin' tank.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.833
Right, hurry up and get the fuck
ready and I'll see yous in a
bit.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.567
Scott has finally came through.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.567
I'm glad that I'm not going to
work.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.800
I am buzzing!

26:13.867 --> 26:15.133
(yells)

26:15.200 --> 26:17.567
Suck on that, bitch.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.467
I'm gonna go get ready.

26:25.767 --> 26:27.900
Does it look like it fits my bum
or not?

26:27.967 --> 26:30.567
I'm not wearing these pants
cos I've got VPL.

26:30.633 --> 26:32.700
What's VPL?
Visible panty line.

26:32.767 --> 26:35.267
What? Visible panty line?

26:36.400 --> 26:37.700
Let's go drive tanks.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.700
Oh!

26:42.767 --> 26:45.533
Chloe, I'm sorry that
you're going on a boys day.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.033
We'll all be out tonight.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.767
There's literally
snowballs in me shoes.

26:49.833 --> 26:52.033
It's in me fanny,
it's in me arsehole,

26:52.100 --> 26:53.800
I need to go to the doctors.

27:04.867 --> 27:06.333
Where the fuck are we?

27:06.400 --> 27:08.500
So these lot have actually shown
up
for work.

27:08.567 --> 27:11.233
I cannae wait to get them
test tanking for Anna's work.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.467
It actually looks proper mint.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.467
Atten-fucking-tion.

27:15.533 --> 27:18.100
Nathan, you fit right in
with your barimans.

27:18.167 --> 27:21.133
I thought if we were doing tanks
I might as well dress in green.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.367
Howay then,
let's go drive some tanks.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.233
I shouldn't have worn heels.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.400
Tanks are for boys and Sam and
Adam
will be glued together.

27:28.467 --> 27:30.367
Thank God I have got Nathan.

27:30.433 --> 27:31.433
Let's do it.

27:32.933 --> 27:37.200
I'm taking this very serious.
Where's the face paint?

27:37.267 --> 27:40.067
Have I got a moustache?
Hurry the fuck up.

27:40.133 --> 27:41.367
Yes, boss!

27:42.333 --> 27:45.033
I look like a sexy army Ken
doll.

27:45.100 --> 27:49.267
Here goes. I'm really excited
for this, you know. Get up.

27:49.333 --> 27:52.900
I'm livin' out every fuckers'
dream.
I feel like an Action Man.

27:52.967 --> 27:56.033
Right, you little dafties.
At least I know you all turned
up,

27:56.100 --> 27:58.133
so I'm going to get myself away.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.600
I only came to work today to
make
sure these lot showed up on
time,

28:01.667 --> 28:03.533
they did, but now I've got to
bounce

28:03.600 --> 28:05.567
because I've got a meeting
at the end of me dick

28:05.633 --> 28:07.500
with a 5'10" naughty brunette.

28:07.567 --> 28:11.300
Have fun, be safe
and fuckin' behave.

28:11.367 --> 28:12.733
See you in a bit, Scotty.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.600
We've not been here two minutes
and Scott needs to leave.

28:15.667 --> 28:17.267
He is fucking shit at his job.

28:17.333 --> 28:18.733
Crank that engine, Sam.

28:18.800 --> 28:22.133
Adam's failed his driving test
eight
times, Nathan's failed it six

28:22.200 --> 28:23.967
and I've seen Chloe drive.

28:24.033 --> 28:26.200
Pass me the keys,
yous aren't driving.

28:26.267 --> 28:27.633
(Chloe) Oh!

28:30.233 --> 28:34.267
I am driving a tank. This is
unreal!

28:34.333 --> 28:36.067
Wahey!

28:37.233 --> 28:40.867
Wahey! Professional tank driver.

28:40.933 --> 28:43.067
Oh, my God, yous, look at the
hill.

28:43.133 --> 28:45.600
(Chloe) I'm not going down
there!

28:45.667 --> 28:46.900
(yelling)

28:48.067 --> 28:49.333
Oh, my God!

28:49.400 --> 28:51.967
(all yelling)

28:52.033 --> 28:53.533
It's fuckin' mint, this.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.533
(yelling)

29:00.233 --> 29:02.733
I've had enough of this,
Nathan, let's get out.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.500
Yous, I'm...

29:04.567 --> 29:07.800
So, I don't think this is really
my thing to be honest.

29:07.867 --> 29:11.600
I mean it's very boyish, isn't
it?
It's more Sam and Adam's thing.

29:13.267 --> 29:16.367
Today's been great,
but I'm worried about Chloe.

29:16.433 --> 29:18.467
I need to chat to her
about her and Sam.

29:18.533 --> 29:20.200
Yous go from one extreme
to the other.

29:20.267 --> 29:24.867
You go from being really happy
to then an explosive argument.

29:24.933 --> 29:27.500
There's no in the middle,
like the build up.

29:27.567 --> 29:30.900
I feel like I've been keeping
this
inside of us quite long now,

29:30.967 --> 29:33.700
like, I didn't want to bring it
in the house.

29:33.767 --> 29:36.933
I ask sometimes for Sam to do
things
for us and he doesn't do it.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Me and Sam have been together
a long time now

29:39.067 --> 29:42.600
and he follows so many girls on
social media who are half naked

29:42.667 --> 29:45.967
and that makes me feel so
insecure
and he just doesn't understand.

29:46.033 --> 29:49.433
It's always on me mind, I just
feel
like, the social media
situation,

29:49.500 --> 29:53.000
it's happened a few times, we've
had
a few arguments about it now,

29:53.067 --> 29:55.833
it just makes me think
he's put me second best,

29:55.900 --> 29:58.700
and he must care about
some other girls.

29:58.767 --> 30:01.700
Chloe's ranting about Sam
following girls on social media,

30:01.767 --> 30:04.400
but I think there's
a bigger picture.

30:04.467 --> 30:07.533
Cracks are starting to show
after his Plain Jane comment.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.800
Me and Sam do argue, not a lot,
but
we do, every relationship does
that.

30:11.867 --> 30:15.133
He wants to give off that image
that
he's in the perfect relationship

30:15.200 --> 30:17.367
I know it's anything but that.

30:17.433 --> 30:19.967
I think that something
he needs to come to accept.

30:20.033 --> 30:21.100
Wah!

30:21.167 --> 30:22.967
Fuckin' fly in my fuckin' grill!

30:23.033 --> 30:26.600
It went straight up my fuckin'
nostril, you dirty bastard.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.267
Today's been unreal.
It's been a right laugh.

30:31.333 --> 30:34.900
This is the kind of work
I can deal with. Cheers, Anna.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.933
The other night, the likes of
Sophie,
we've made up now,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.767
but her input made everything
ten times worse.

30:41.833 --> 30:45.833
She might want what you and
Chloe
have got cos she's single now.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.633
Is that cos she's jealous
of our relationship

30:48.700 --> 30:51.267
or is that cos she's been single
for a while?

30:51.333 --> 30:54.667
I think Sophie could be jealous
of what me and Chloe have.

30:54.733 --> 30:56.500
She was in a relationship for
years

30:56.567 --> 30:58.800
and seeing that
maybe makes her miss it.

30:58.867 --> 31:02.033
I'm just hoping for now, that if
me and Chloe are arguing again,

31:02.100 --> 31:04.100
she just sort of leaves it.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.933
Lets me and Chloe resolve it.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.933
Sophie is the mam of the house
and
her heart is in the right place,

31:09.033 --> 31:11.733
but in this case she needs
to step back for Sam's sake.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.400
Where the fuck are the others?
Shall we go and find them?
Howay.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.733
I have had a fuckin' mint day
but it's time for us to get home

31:19.800 --> 31:21.633
and get even more tanked
tonight.

31:28.833 --> 31:32.667
I am the mam of the house,
I cannot physically live in
this,

31:32.733 --> 31:34.733
so we've got to clear up
as much as we can.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.433
Since we've done sweet FA all
day,
we've got to get we arses in
gear

31:38.500 --> 31:42.100
before the others come back,
so it looks like we give a fuck.

31:42.167 --> 31:46.100
This is just getting you in
practice
for when you find Mr Right.

31:46.167 --> 31:47.767
And you Abbie.

31:47.833 --> 31:50.033
How are we meant
to get these balls in here?

31:50.100 --> 31:52.600
You've dealt with
a few balls before.

31:52.667 --> 31:56.000
These can't be any different.
There's cheesy chips left.

31:56.067 --> 31:59.967
All of this cold, manky kebab
is getting me starving again.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.633
I want a bagel, I'm hungry.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.800
Here you go!

32:02.867 --> 32:04.233
Ow!

32:04.300 --> 32:06.033
You're welcome.
That fuckin' hurt.

32:06.100 --> 32:09.500
Even though we are cleaning, I
am
lovin' spending time with the
girls.

32:09.567 --> 32:12.300
I'm making proper bonds with
them
and settling in.

32:12.367 --> 32:15.267
Right, bag's full.
Where do I put it?

32:15.333 --> 32:18.567
In the fuckin' bin.
That's what normal people do.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.567
Hi!

32:26.633 --> 32:28.533
Have yous had a good day?

32:28.600 --> 32:30.400
It's been great!

32:30.467 --> 32:32.367
It was shit.
It was not, it was good!

32:32.433 --> 32:34.267
Have you been cleaning?
Yeah.

32:34.333 --> 32:38.033
The girls have done a shit job
of
cleaning. Fuck it, I'm not
helpin',

32:38.100 --> 32:39.433
I need to get ready.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
I'm getting ready for tonight!

32:41.567 --> 32:43.333
(laughter)

32:50.533 --> 32:51.933
See you later.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.100
Meet Trisha,
you'll see her very soon.

32:59.933 --> 33:02.033
I am going to have a chat
with Abbie,

33:02.100 --> 33:05.000
I think if we carry on going
the way we are going, mate,

33:05.067 --> 33:08.667
she's been blowing hot and cold
and
I haven't known where I've been
at.

33:08.733 --> 33:12.233
Abbie told Sam she wasn't
interested
but I want to know for meself.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.467
If there is any chance she likes
us,
I want to know.

33:14.533 --> 33:17.300
If she's not gonna want you,
just fuckin' pull when you want.

33:17.367 --> 33:20.700
Exactly, aye. No dramas.
Nah. Everyone's a winner.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.433
I can't believe
I'm the first to be ready.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.367
Chloe, I'm really feeling
the wig tonight.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.000
You've kind of stole my vibe.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.067
I am flattered Chloe wants to
look like me,

33:37.133 --> 33:40.033
I've always wanted a twin,
so this could be fun.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.300
Who you are going to pull?
What are your tactics going to
be?

33:43.367 --> 33:45.733
I don't think I need tactics
with how good I look. Woo!

33:45.800 --> 33:48.200
Walk up and be like, hello.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.033
Meet Barbara.
Isn't Barbara your cat?

33:54.100 --> 33:57.300
No, sorry. Actually,
let me rephrase that. Joanne.

33:57.367 --> 33:59.100
Hey, Joanne.

34:01.967 --> 34:04.133
One for me, one for you.
One for the Bestie.

34:04.200 --> 34:07.033
Nathan, me and you
are such besties aren't we?

34:07.100 --> 34:09.433
I have loved Nathan being at
work
with me today

34:09.500 --> 34:12.266
and I've decided tonight
is a bestie night.

34:12.333 --> 34:16.567
Bestie, Bestie friend night like
when we first came in the house,

34:16.632 --> 34:21.000
proper old school where we get
pissed and dance like dickheads.

34:21.067 --> 34:25.067
I can't dance because me wig
will
fall off and that'll be
embarrassing.

34:25.132 --> 34:28.333
We'll take some superglue out
and superglue the bitch down.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.900
You're not supergluing my head,
you freak.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.400
Thank God for Nathan.
He is always there for us

34:33.467 --> 34:36.100
and I cannot wait for tonight
to get mortal with him.

34:36.167 --> 34:38.367
Me and you. Besties.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.132
To besties.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.367
I know Chloe's got a lot
on her mind with Sam

34:43.433 --> 34:45.600
and that's why she wants
a night out with me.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.867
Let's see how long I get
the old Chloe back for.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.300
Howay lads, hurry up!

34:52.367 --> 34:53.667
Hello, hello, hello.

34:53.733 --> 34:57.400
I am well up for tonight,
it's going to be fuckin' mint.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.867
Right everyone, this is
to a good night.

34:59.933 --> 35:02.300
Cheers.
(all) Cheers.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.100
All the best.
Is that it?

35:04.167 --> 35:07.600
(both) Cheers to the fuckin'
wicked night!

35:07.667 --> 35:09.800
I'm toasting to having
my best friend,

35:09.867 --> 35:11.500
let's get to the fuckin' club.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.667
Shall we have a girls taxi?
Girls taxi?

35:14.733 --> 35:16.700
You've got to ride with me.

35:25.033 --> 35:26.467
That is news to me.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.267
You are so immature.

35:30.767 --> 35:32.167
The shag pad is that way.

35:33.367 --> 35:34.367
Why not?!

35:36.533 --> 35:38.233
Geordie Shore, wey aye!

35:41.000 --> 35:41.200
.

35:43.667 --> 35:43.867
.

35:55.667 --> 35:59.067
We get to the club
and it is absolutely bouncin'.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.600
This is going to be a good
night.

36:00.667 --> 36:02.800
(loud dance music throughout)

36:17.833 --> 36:21.800
Everyone's got such crazy moves.
We're getting along so well
tonight.

36:31.433 --> 36:33.667
Sam, hold the phone, caller.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.700
I'm on a best friend night
with Chloe.

36:56.133 --> 37:00.033
Sam's right, Sophie does get too
involved with him and Chloe.

37:09.733 --> 37:11.833
Sophie is anything but jealous.

37:11.900 --> 37:15.067
Why would she be jealous
of a relationship that's up and
down

37:15.133 --> 37:16.667
more than a fuckin' yoyo?

37:28.267 --> 37:30.767
I'm need to tell Sophie exactly
what Sam's said

37:30.833 --> 37:32.433
and she's gonna be pissed off.

37:38.333 --> 37:41.867
Hang on. I'm jealous
of Sam and Chloe?

37:41.933 --> 37:44.167
Now that is news to me.

37:52.033 --> 37:55.200
It's shit that after me and Sam
sorted things out

37:55.267 --> 37:58.067
he's been going around saying
I'm jealous. It's hurtful.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.133
Me and Sophie have only just
resolved things

38:15.200 --> 38:17.133
and I don't want it
to flare up again.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.400
For the sake of tonight,
I'm going to play it down.

38:28.767 --> 38:31.167
I knew something else would come
up
with Sam.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.667
Chloe's my friend
and I live with them,

38:33.733 --> 38:35.467
I'm gonna give her advice.

38:39.367 --> 38:43.000
For Chloe's sake, I'll give Sam
the benefit of the doubt right
now,

38:43.067 --> 38:45.233
but if he ever calls me
jealous again

38:45.300 --> 38:46.967
I'll have something
to say about it.

39:00.267 --> 39:01.633
Fuck this, I've had a drink,

39:01.700 --> 39:04.133
and I'm going to lay me cards
on the table.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.200
I want to hear how she really
feels.

39:11.867 --> 39:14.767
I thought me and Adam were
going to have a conversation,

39:14.833 --> 39:18.500
but he's just hitting on us
again.
What doesn't he get?

39:21.700 --> 39:26.100
This is why I don't fancy you,
Adam,
because you are so immature.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.567
(laughs) I really don't know why
I laughed there.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.000
Adam probably wasn't being
malicious,

39:48.067 --> 39:51.067
he's just that stupid,
he can't hold a conversation.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.367
I've had enough of Nathan
for tonight. I missed my Sam.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.467
Chloe promised me a bestie night
and it hasn't taken long

40:16.533 --> 40:19.767
before it's a standard Chloe and
Sam
glued together night.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.167
Nice one, bestie.

40:29.100 --> 40:32.400
Chloe's so pissed, she's already
rolling around on the floor.

40:34.300 --> 40:37.133
I think that is our cue to go
home.

40:46.933 --> 40:51.333
What's that? Don't look,
don't look at my garlic bread.

40:52.333 --> 40:53.400
Get off it!

40:53.467 --> 40:56.500
It's feeding time at the Geordie
zoo
and I am so glad

40:56.567 --> 40:58.633
to be demolishing this dirty
kebab.

40:59.733 --> 41:02.700
Don't look at my garlic bread.
Don't. Don't terminate it.

41:02.767 --> 41:07.300
I just hit the jack pot!

41:07.367 --> 41:09.933
Adam, I tried to tell you
as a friend,

41:10.033 --> 41:11.533
tried to tell you how I feel.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.033
I am still fuming,
I know I shouldn't

41:14.100 --> 41:15.833
but I can't help bring it up.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.867
You sat, you fuckin' stood
and laughed in my face!

41:19.933 --> 41:22.333
Why would you do that?
I would never.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.067
You're fuckin laughin' again.
You're making us! It's not
funny.

41:26.333 --> 41:27.767
(Chloe) Howay then!

41:27.833 --> 41:30.600
I've done my best to help Adam
out,
but right now,

41:30.667 --> 41:34.100
I cannot be arsed listening
to Abbie whinge. We're going to
bed.

41:34.167 --> 41:36.600
Are you scared of us?
I am actually scared of ya.

41:36.667 --> 41:39.467
Why you walking away?
Are you scared?

41:39.533 --> 41:43.000
This is too much for me.
There's too much sexual
chemistry

41:43.067 --> 41:44.967
in the air between Adam and
Abbie,

41:45.033 --> 41:46.967
howay Faith, let's leave them to
it.

41:47.033 --> 41:49.767
You're always the joker!
Why you going on about it?

41:49.833 --> 41:51.733
Can't even have a serious
conversation!

41:51.800 --> 41:53.167
(they laugh)

41:53.233 --> 41:55.267
Adam and Abbie really are all
over
the shop,

41:55.333 --> 41:57.233
they don't seem to know
how they feel.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.667
Let just have a hug like
best friends, you fuckin'...

42:02.667 --> 42:04.567
(Adam and Abbie laugh)

42:04.633 --> 42:06.600
Erm, the shag pad is that way,
guys.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.700
Fuck that.
Ow.

42:08.767 --> 42:10.633
Tonight's been a bit too much
for me.

42:10.700 --> 42:13.633
One minute Abbie's shouting,
next we're on the floor.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.633
I need to get to bed.

42:23.067 --> 42:27.333
I am so horny but I just could
not
be arsed to go to the shag pad,

42:27.400 --> 42:30.433
I don't have the stamina,
but me and Sam need to have a
chat.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.533
(Chloe)

42:31.600 --> 42:32.600
(Sam)

42:32.667 --> 42:37.467
Chloe wants to have sex in the
boys
bedroom, with the boys in here.

42:37.533 --> 42:38.767
Why not?

42:38.833 --> 42:41.067
(Chloe)

42:44.367 --> 42:46.167
(Chloe)

42:46.233 --> 42:49.767
Me and Sam are trying to have
secret
sex but he has pushed his luck.

42:49.833 --> 42:53.733
Sorry hun, if you want this ring
you
need to put a ring on this
finger,

42:53.800 --> 42:54.800
I think.

42:54.867 --> 42:58.067
(Chloe)

42:58.900 --> 42:59.900
(panting)

43:01.900 --> 43:06.300
Tonight was about me and Chloe,
but she ditched me again

43:06.367 --> 43:09.833
and now I've got to listen to
them
in the bed next to me.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.033
Perfect.

43:15.967 --> 43:18.233
We're going burlesque dancing.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.767
Oh, vagina.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.833
Do you know what would be good?
A games night. That'd be mint.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.400
Aw!

43:24.467 --> 43:26.600
Yes, I love snakes and ladders.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.133
(yelling)

43:28.200 --> 43:29.400
Adam's slipped!

43:30.833 --> 43:33.133
I've got a friend who has
a property in Benidorm.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.800
(cheers)
Let's get on the road.

43:34.867 --> 43:36.333
Oh, my God.

43:36.400 --> 43:39.467
This is the most incredible
villa
I've ever seen. (cheering)

43:39.533 --> 43:41.867
We're going to tear Benny a new
one.

43:41.933 --> 43:45.033
I know I was in the wrong but
what
have I got to be jealous about?

43:45.100 --> 43:47.767
Sophie! Think I'm fuckin'
jealous
of you?

44:14.900 --> 44:15.100
.
