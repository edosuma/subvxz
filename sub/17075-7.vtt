WEBVTT

00:01.641 --> 00:03.218
Morning.

00:05.031 --> 00:06.953
Another weigh-in for wrestling?

00:06.978 --> 00:08.131
Yep.

00:08.156 --> 00:10.191
- What are you doing?
- We're down a wrestler.

00:10.216 --> 00:13.384
Scotty Butler, our 125,
got mono from his sister,

00:13.452 --> 00:15.818
so, we need a sub, otherwise
we have to forfeit the match.

00:15.844 --> 00:19.256
And, just as I suspected,
you are 125 on the dot.

00:19.325 --> 00:21.158
Okay, first of all,
it's not gonna happen.

00:21.183 --> 00:23.787
Second of all, I'm still
stuck on the mono thing.

00:23.812 --> 00:26.430
- Did he kiss his sister?
- Come on, Kenny.

00:26.455 --> 00:27.851
I'm undefeated this year.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.242
If we forfeit this match,

00:29.267 --> 00:31.001
then I don't get to go to finals.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.903
Jimmy, I would love to help you,

00:32.971 --> 00:34.537
but I am not a wrestler.

00:34.562 --> 00:36.740
Uh, yes, you are.

00:36.765 --> 00:38.186
Don't you remember when we were kids,

00:38.211 --> 00:39.537
I trapped you and held you down,

00:39.562 --> 00:41.811
and I threatened to spit on
your face? That's wrestling.

00:41.836 --> 00:43.576
Okay, well, as appealing
as you make it sound,

00:43.601 --> 00:45.015
I'm still not interested.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.282
Okay, fine.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.917
I'm calling in the favor you owe me.

00:47.985 --> 00:49.352
I thought it was gonna be

00:49.421 --> 00:51.665
you giving me your liver
when I use mine up in college.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.099
I don't owe you a favor.

00:53.124 --> 00:54.217
Three words, Kenny...

00:54.242 --> 00:56.399
"West Side Story"...

00:56.424 --> 00:57.899
sing-along.

00:58.597 --> 01:00.139
Fine. I'll do it.

01:00.164 --> 01:02.464
But, don't pretend that you didn't
love every second of that movie.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.533
- I didn't.
- Oh? Yeah?

01:04.602 --> 01:05.978
So you didn't feel anything

01:06.003 --> 01:07.391
when Tony died in Maria's arms?

01:07.416 --> 01:08.490
- No.
- Okay.

01:08.515 --> 01:09.732
How about when they first met?

01:09.757 --> 01:11.540
You mean the first time they
saw each other at the dance?

01:11.609 --> 01:13.484
And everyone else was out
of focus for some reason,

01:13.509 --> 01:15.377
and they realized they loved each other?

01:15.446 --> 01:16.578
In an instant?

01:16.647 --> 01:18.357
Yeah, of course I felt it, Kenny.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.381
How could you not? It's so beautiful.

01:20.406 --> 01:22.789
Their love was doomed from the overture.

01:23.019 --> 01:24.720
- Maria.
- Tony.

01:27.093 --> 01:29.000
God, I wish I didn't live with girls.

01:29.025 --> 01:33.205

01:35.232 --> 01:37.132
Hey, I got your text.
What's the emergency.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.475
I'm going on a business trip with Clive

01:39.500 --> 01:41.002
and I need you to get
down the big suitcase.

01:41.071 --> 01:42.475
That's not an emergency.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.318
And, by business, do you mean
like, the business business?

01:45.343 --> 01:47.031
No, I'm getting my own room.

01:47.056 --> 01:49.734
Besides, it's just a Vice
Principal's conference.

01:49.759 --> 01:51.146
Oh, so no one's getting laid, then.

01:51.214 --> 01:52.823
I can't believe it.

01:52.848 --> 01:55.443
I haven't stayed in a
hotel in, what, five years?

01:55.468 --> 01:58.412
I'm gonna take a bath and
a shower at the same time.

01:58.437 --> 02:00.959
It'll be a perfect storm of luxury.

02:00.984 --> 02:03.624
I can't believe it's been that
long since we went to the shore.

02:04.588 --> 02:06.764
Gosh. Remember, you were so
obsessed with collecting those rocks.

02:06.789 --> 02:07.795
Oh, yeah.

02:07.820 --> 02:08.839
Did you ever do anything with them?

02:08.864 --> 02:10.741
No, I never found them when we got home.

02:12.668 --> 02:14.467
I think I found them.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.203
And I just threw out my back.

02:17.206 --> 02:18.806
- Don't touch me!
- Aah!

02:19.675 --> 02:21.008
Great. I need it by Friday.

02:21.076 --> 02:22.209
- Ethan.
- Shannon.

02:22.278 --> 02:24.350
I have a great idea for
an article in the paper.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.953
You've already pitched
"Behind The Mascot:

02:25.978 --> 02:27.404
"Who Really Is The
Saint Barklay's Bulldog?"

02:27.449 --> 02:29.182
I'm convinced it's Joyce the lunch lady.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.017
We've never seen them in
the same room together.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.286
But what I really want to
write is a scathing piece

02:33.355 --> 02:36.521
on the most antiquated, sexist
organization at this school...

02:36.546 --> 02:37.857
Mat Maids.

02:37.926 --> 02:40.193
Yeah, why do wrestlers
get their own cheerleaders?

02:40.261 --> 02:43.045
My mathlete team gets zero
support and several wedgies.

02:43.070 --> 02:45.131
Which is why I am
going to infiltrate them

02:45.200 --> 02:47.945
and take them down from the inside.

02:48.203 --> 02:49.982
- I love you.
- What?

02:50.007 --> 02:51.137
I mean, I love your idea.

02:51.206 --> 02:54.414
Fitzgerald, where is
that political cartoon?

02:59.165 --> 03:01.093
2! Take-down, red.

03:01.445 --> 03:03.093
I changed my mind.

03:03.118 --> 03:04.484
You can have my liver.
I don't want to do this.

03:04.509 --> 03:05.625
It looks really painful.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.342
It's only painful if you resist.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.476
Remember, you're not trying
to win, so just go limp...

03:09.501 --> 03:11.217
you know, like when you're
falling off a building.

03:11.242 --> 03:13.058
Jimmy, no one knows how that feels

03:13.126 --> 03:14.640
because those people are dead.

03:14.665 --> 03:16.827
All right, little O'Neal,
you're up after this match.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.864
But, remember, it's like
being mauled by a bear.

03:18.971 --> 03:20.545
Don't resist, and you'll be fine.

03:20.570 --> 03:23.248
Again, so incorrect, but I'll do it.

03:23.273 --> 03:24.326
I just need a second.

03:24.351 --> 03:27.007
I'm gonna go splash some
water on my face backstage.

03:27.351 --> 03:28.951
That's gay for "locker room".

03:28.976 --> 03:31.726
He also calls "halftime,"
"intermission".

03:35.849 --> 03:37.351
Towel?

03:38.093 --> 03:39.173
Oh, my God.

03:39.198 --> 03:40.717
Gus Kenworthy and Robbie Rogers?

03:40.787 --> 03:42.687
You guys are, like, my
favorite professional athletes.

03:42.712 --> 03:43.834
What are you guys doing here?

03:43.859 --> 03:46.507
We're here to cheer on Saint
Barklay's first out gay athlete.

03:46.532 --> 03:47.882
Well, look at me.

03:47.907 --> 03:49.459
I'm not a wrestler.

03:49.528 --> 03:50.959
I'm the gay kid.

03:50.984 --> 03:52.429
Whoa. You can be both.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.064
I mean, being gay has never stopped me

03:54.089 --> 03:56.146
from strapping on skis and
dropping into a half-pipe.

03:56.171 --> 03:58.769
And, it didn't stop me from becoming
one of the first openly-gay athletes

03:58.837 --> 03:59.969
in major-league sports.

03:59.994 --> 04:02.242
- Humble brag, Robbie.
- I have an MLS Cup.

04:02.267 --> 04:05.506
Nobody knows what that is. I have
a silver medal... from the Olympics.

04:05.531 --> 04:07.693
Oh, were they out of gold that day?

04:07.718 --> 04:09.850
Okay, gay athletes, stop fighting.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.865
I mean, have you seen them out there?

04:11.890 --> 04:12.926
Even if I go limp,

04:12.951 --> 04:15.498
I-I-I'm gonna die in
front of the entire school.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.720
That's why you have to try.

04:16.752 --> 04:17.894
- Don't be a cliché.
- Mm.

04:17.956 --> 04:18.999
What have you really got to lose?

04:19.024 --> 04:20.904
Well, my vision, several teeth,

04:20.928 --> 04:21.982
my short-term memory.

04:22.007 --> 04:24.127
People can lead very
full lives without teeth.

04:24.195 --> 04:25.851
Yeah...

04:26.164 --> 04:27.711
Make us proud.

04:31.636 --> 04:33.269
Mm. Nope.

04:36.012 --> 04:38.464
This is a horrible indictment of myself,

04:38.489 --> 04:40.242
but this bed still smells like me.

04:40.311 --> 04:42.043
Trust me. I've tried everything.

04:43.213 --> 04:44.956
Okay, you're all set.

04:44.981 --> 04:46.346
You've got a bucket there by the bed.

04:46.371 --> 04:47.643
I don't have to throw up.

04:47.668 --> 04:48.784
That's in case you need to pee.

04:48.809 --> 04:50.339
Kids'll be home in seven hours.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.464
- Knockity-knock-knock.
- There's Clive. Got to go.

04:52.489 --> 04:53.698
But, wait, I'm still hurting.

04:53.723 --> 04:56.323
I am not giving up my
Courtyard by Marriott

04:56.348 --> 04:57.651
because of your weak lower back.

04:57.676 --> 04:58.878
Everything all right in there?

04:58.903 --> 05:00.331
- Permission to enter?
- Hey.

05:00.356 --> 05:01.753
Hey, buddy.

05:01.778 --> 05:03.620
What are you doing in Eileen's bed?

05:03.645 --> 05:05.167
Have... have you guys made up?

05:05.235 --> 05:06.468
Are you back together?

05:06.536 --> 05:07.535
I-I-I'm just kidding.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.371
But, seriously, you can tell me.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.305
He's fine. He just threw out his back.

05:11.374 --> 05:12.909
Oh, buddy. Poor thing.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.943
What can I get for you?
What-what-what can I do?

05:15.011 --> 05:17.043
Well, he's got a bucket.
What else does he need?

05:17.068 --> 05:19.524
Tender, loving care and
a constant companion.

05:19.549 --> 05:20.992
We can't go on our trip.

05:21.017 --> 05:23.729
Eileen, Sheboygan will have to wait.

05:23.754 --> 05:26.320
Well, but, what about your
Vice Principal's conference?

05:26.389 --> 05:29.221
I mean, you're the understudy
for the keynote speaker.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.262
Oh, my understudy will understudy.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.553
Wait...

05:32.754 --> 05:36.325
you weren't planning on leaving
Pat here alone, were you?

05:36.350 --> 05:37.885
What?

05:39.702 --> 05:41.668
Wait, you really gave him a bucket?

05:41.737 --> 05:43.934
I was gonna put soup in it.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.239
Um, it's the Irish way, you see.

05:46.264 --> 05:49.476
That's why we call dying
"kicking the bucket," you see?

05:49.501 --> 05:52.145
Because you run out of soup, so you...

05:52.214 --> 05:53.256
I'm gonna go to the store

05:53.281 --> 05:55.010
and get you some homemade soup.

05:58.153 --> 06:00.143
Come on, get him, Kenny. Let's do this.

06:00.168 --> 06:01.467
Shake hands.

06:01.700 --> 06:02.765
Hi.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.346
I don't know if I can do this.

06:04.371 --> 06:06.771
This guy looks like he's
all muscle and no mercy.

06:06.796 --> 06:08.926
I'm just gonna take the fall.

06:10.475 --> 06:11.706
Damn you, gay athletes.

06:11.731 --> 06:13.597
You filled me with athletic ambition.

06:13.622 --> 06:14.720
I want to win this.

06:14.789 --> 06:16.321
How am I gonna do that?

06:20.417 --> 06:22.494
- What is he doing?
- I know this.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.300
I know these moves. It's...

06:24.325 --> 06:26.043
it's "West Side Story."

06:26.068 --> 06:28.237
It's Riff and Bernardo at the rumble.

06:28.277 --> 06:30.410
Do it for the Jets, Kenny!

06:31.926 --> 06:34.137
- 2, takedown. 3.
- Oh!

06:34.418 --> 06:36.026
2, reversal red.

06:39.647 --> 06:41.213
- Whoo!
- Yeah, Kenny.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.526
Bulldogs.

06:44.551 --> 06:46.426
Is it done? Did I do it? Did I win?

06:46.451 --> 06:47.596
- Yeah.
- You did it. You're done. You won.

06:47.621 --> 06:49.054
- I won?
- You won!

06:49.122 --> 06:50.555
What?

06:53.426 --> 06:56.160
Okay, pal, the safest
way to set you down

06:56.185 --> 06:57.621
is to pull you down on top of me,

06:57.646 --> 06:59.530
and then I'm gonna
squirm out from under.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.371
Wait, that's the safest way?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.079
Dad?

07:04.104 --> 07:05.403
You're never gonna believe this.

07:05.428 --> 07:06.914
Kenny won his wrestling match.

07:06.939 --> 07:08.114
He's a natural.

07:08.139 --> 07:09.440
I was supposed to go limp, but I didn't.

07:09.465 --> 07:10.497
I didn't go limp.

07:10.522 --> 07:12.743
- Good, buddy.
- Yeah, that's amazing.

07:12.768 --> 07:14.579
Oh, by the way, that
thing digging into your leg

07:14.647 --> 07:16.347
- is my phone.
- Okay.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.473
- Should we ask about this?
- No, let's leave it a mystery.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.645
Boys, I threw out my back.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.719
Otherwise, I'd be jumping
up and down with you,

07:21.744 --> 07:22.885
hugging you right now.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.621
Kenny, way to go, man.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.106
I didn't even know you
were on the wrestling team.

07:26.131 --> 07:28.025
I'm not, but it felt good.

07:28.094 --> 07:30.427
I mean, I've never
felt this rush before.

07:30.495 --> 07:32.878
I guess this is why
people play the sports.

07:32.903 --> 07:33.901
But, maybe I should just...

07:33.926 --> 07:35.265
you know, maybe I should join the team.

07:35.334 --> 07:36.700
Yeah, well, you should definitely join.

07:36.769 --> 07:38.371
It's kind of late in the... the season.

07:38.396 --> 07:40.917
You'd be more of a sub,
but yeah... but, yeah, sure.

07:40.942 --> 07:42.239
I'm an athlete.

07:42.264 --> 07:43.564
I'm an athlete.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.242
Less so when you do that,

07:45.267 --> 07:46.559
but yeah, you go get them, champ.

07:46.584 --> 07:48.851
You know what? Get me
up. I want to hug my sons.

07:48.876 --> 07:51.340
All right, but there's
only one way to do it.

07:53.129 --> 07:54.317
Take my hands.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.484
Don't be scared.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.403
This doesn't feel right.

07:57.712 --> 07:59.374
Oh, God,

07:59.399 --> 08:00.867
I'm gonna be late for class.

08:00.892 --> 08:02.570
Do you think I could use the jock card

08:02.595 --> 08:04.531
to, you know, get the
teacher to go easy on me?

08:04.556 --> 08:06.155
Okay, hold up, hold up.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.413
It takes a long time to earn that.

08:08.438 --> 08:10.679
I have it because I'm undefeated.

08:10.704 --> 08:12.829
You won one match.

08:12.854 --> 08:14.564
Oh, okay, here come the Mat Maids.

08:14.633 --> 08:15.698
Uh, they're cheerleaders

08:15.767 --> 08:17.033
who, out of the
goodness of their hearts,

08:17.101 --> 08:18.334
leave us gifts in our lockers.

08:18.403 --> 08:19.903
I get Chloe Perrente,

08:19.971 --> 08:22.663
emphasis on the Perrentes.

08:22.695 --> 08:24.180
I feel like you could
do that with any name.

08:24.205 --> 08:25.741
Oh, no, I can. O'Neals.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.148
Ew.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.538
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Chloe.

08:29.913 --> 08:31.062
I take it that's for me.

08:31.087 --> 08:33.056
- Actually, it's for Kenny.
- What?

08:33.081 --> 08:35.313
We drew straws, and I won
the chance to be paired with

08:35.337 --> 08:37.230
Saint Barklay's first gay wrestler.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.035
Oh, thank you.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.327
But... but, you're mine.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.128
The Perrentes were mine.

08:42.153 --> 08:43.452
Who... who do I get?

08:44.294 --> 08:45.751
Hello, James.

08:45.776 --> 08:46.822
You?

08:46.847 --> 08:48.275
I get the O'Neals.

08:49.286 --> 08:50.952
Oh, my God. You have boobs.

08:50.977 --> 08:53.334
Boobs are ruined. Boobs
are ruined forever.

08:53.403 --> 08:55.203
See you, Kenny.

08:56.548 --> 08:57.979
Since when are you a Mat Maid?

08:58.004 --> 08:59.485
Since when are you a wrestler?

08:59.510 --> 09:00.576
Touché.

09:01.485 --> 09:02.577
Ta-da!

09:02.645 --> 09:04.412
Here is the bathing suit I promised you.

09:04.481 --> 09:05.687
Clive's gonna love it.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.891
I said I wanted a one piece.

09:06.916 --> 09:08.007
Technically, it is.

09:08.078 --> 09:10.413
It's called a monokini.
It's extremely unforgiving.

09:10.438 --> 09:12.954
Well, I don't need it, because
we had to cancel the trip.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.855
Oh, no. What happened?

09:14.924 --> 09:16.507
Pat threw his back out,

09:16.532 --> 09:18.874
and now Clive wants to stay
home and take care of him.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.360
It's a horrible color on both of them.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.548
Watch it. Coming through.

09:22.573 --> 09:23.569
Excuse me.

09:23.594 --> 09:26.094
Oh, Eileen, how are you?

09:26.119 --> 09:27.165
What is all this?

09:27.190 --> 09:29.687
Oh, it's got crosswords,
beef jerky, Mad Libs,

09:29.712 --> 09:31.025
Anjou pears... the peak of ripeness...

09:31.050 --> 09:33.117
Tiger Bomb, some
jasmine-scented Epsom salts.

09:33.142 --> 09:34.476
It's just the bare-bones basics.

09:34.501 --> 09:35.734
I should really get it to Pat.

09:35.759 --> 09:37.202
It seems a little extreme.

09:37.227 --> 09:38.851
I thought it wasn't enough.

09:38.876 --> 09:40.459
They were out of his
favorite saltwater taffy.

09:40.484 --> 09:41.663
I feel like an ass.

09:41.688 --> 09:43.385
He likes saltwater taffy?

09:43.453 --> 09:46.065
That's his favorite non-chocolate candy.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.488
How do you not know that?

09:49.558 --> 09:51.503
Did you see that look?

09:51.737 --> 09:54.262
He's never looked at
me like that before.

09:54.330 --> 09:55.763
Was he judging me?

09:55.831 --> 09:57.346
Neither one of you is perfect.

09:57.394 --> 09:59.214
Does he think I'm not
a nurturing person?

09:59.239 --> 10:01.065
I'm a nurturing person, aren't I?

10:01.090 --> 10:02.128
Yeah. Totally.

10:02.153 --> 10:03.970
You took care of me after
I had my appendix out.

10:04.039 --> 10:05.815
That's right. I did.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.808
I mean, you made me drive
you to the outlet mall.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.045
All right, well, obviously,
I need to show Clive

10:12.114 --> 10:13.480
that I can take care of Pat.

10:13.549 --> 10:14.981
You don't have to prove anything to me.

10:15.050 --> 10:17.142
I scored big time with
that blouse from the mall.

10:17.167 --> 10:20.253
Although, I did ruin it
when my stitches burst.

10:24.126 --> 10:25.458
Chloe, let's chat.

10:25.527 --> 10:27.260
Let me start with an easy question.

10:27.329 --> 10:29.595
Why do you think we have to
wear these super-short skirts?

10:29.620 --> 10:32.409
Uh, well, I guess 'cause
they're easy to move around in.

10:32.434 --> 10:33.633
Okay, sure.

10:33.693 --> 10:35.362
And they show off our legs, right?

10:35.387 --> 10:37.539
Yeah, that's part of it.

10:37.564 --> 10:38.823
And, I'm just curious...

10:38.848 --> 10:40.846
how long should I be spending
on my hair before a meet?

10:40.871 --> 10:42.331
Uh, I don't know.

10:42.356 --> 10:44.877
- Uh, mine takes... an hour.
- An hour?

10:44.902 --> 10:47.580
Like, however long it takes to get
through a "This American Life" podcast.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.495
- What?
- Oh, my God.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.750
This morning, when I was
doing my fishtail braid,

10:51.775 --> 10:53.618
there was an incredible piece on NPR

10:53.687 --> 10:55.096
about factory farming.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.122
Riveting. Right, girls?

10:57.191 --> 10:58.642
- Oh, totally.
- Of course.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.971
You all listen to NPR, too?

10:59.996 --> 11:01.018
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

11:01.043 --> 11:02.527
It all comes down to GMOs.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.596
Until we properly label our food,

11:04.621 --> 11:07.182
it's like putting a
band-aid on an axe wound.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.103
Hey, do you think I could
pull off purple mascara?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.202
What is happening?

11:11.227 --> 11:12.635
Are you smart? Are you dumb?

11:12.660 --> 11:15.198
Are you insightful? Are you vapid?

11:15.223 --> 11:16.448
Who are you girls?

11:16.473 --> 11:17.538
We're fun.

11:17.563 --> 11:19.321
And, we're fluent in five languages.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.143
Allons-y, Mat Maids.

11:21.296 --> 11:23.221
Sacré bleu.

11:23.268 --> 11:25.524
- Thanks, Joyce.
- Have a great day.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.417
I don't think Shannon is right.

11:27.442 --> 11:29.300
Joyce the lunch lady
could not be our mascot.

11:29.325 --> 11:30.495
She has a bad hip.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.245
Plus, there's no way she could
do a round-off in a 40-pound suit.

11:33.270 --> 11:36.300
Hey, you never know what
people are capable of.

11:36.325 --> 11:37.737
I mean, look at me.

11:37.808 --> 11:39.474
I surprised the world.

11:39.542 --> 11:40.475
It was one match.

11:40.543 --> 11:42.290
So brave, what you're doing.

11:42.315 --> 11:43.806
Keep wrestling for the rainbow.

11:43.831 --> 11:45.813
- What? Pudding?
- Double for wrestlers.

11:45.882 --> 11:47.073
I've never even had a single.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.681
I didn't even know
this school had pudding.

11:48.706 --> 11:50.112
- Play it cool.
- Sorry.

11:50.137 --> 11:51.956
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

11:52.322 --> 11:53.454
Don't mind him, he's just a sub.

11:53.523 --> 11:54.622
Pudding me, Joyce.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.479
Sorry, Jimmy, those were my last two.

11:56.504 --> 11:58.569
But I'm about to make history

11:58.594 --> 12:01.584
as the only undefeated
wrestler on the team.

12:01.609 --> 12:04.690
I have, um, some loose
mints in my apron.

12:05.501 --> 12:08.376
All right, mint me, Joyce.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.604
Wintergreen?

12:14.843 --> 12:17.040
Do you think I get to
sit with the jocks, too?

12:17.065 --> 12:19.179
It takes a long time to be invited.

12:19.247 --> 12:20.213
Yo, O'Neal.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.745
Pop a squat.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.956
I actually meant little O'Neal.

12:23.981 --> 12:25.079
Really?

12:25.104 --> 12:27.362
- We'll catch you later, Jimmy.
- Okay.

12:27.565 --> 12:28.970
I was wondering if you
could show me that move

12:28.995 --> 12:30.657
at practice today that
you did at the meet.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.959
It's like it was happening,
and then it wasn't happening.

12:32.984 --> 12:34.446
Man, help me get in your mind.

12:34.471 --> 12:35.962
Let me tell you a little story

12:36.031 --> 12:40.501
about a man named
Joseph Hubertus Pilates.

12:41.087 --> 12:42.335
Here's nurse Eileen.

12:42.403 --> 12:44.148
- Oh, wow.
- How you feeling, Pat?

12:44.173 --> 12:45.727
Actually, I'm feeling a
little bit better, thanks.

12:45.752 --> 12:47.923
Oh, good. Let me just get
a pillow for your head.

12:47.948 --> 12:50.087
- Oh, okay.
- There you go.

12:50.112 --> 12:51.671
Oh, okay, I think that's good.

12:51.696 --> 12:54.593
No, I want you to be nice and comfy.

12:54.618 --> 12:56.220
- Hey, Eileen.
- No, you can never have

12:56.245 --> 12:57.407
- too many pillows.
- Ohh!

12:57.452 --> 12:59.921
I think his feet need to
be higher than his head.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.266
Then all the blood's
gonna rush into his head,

13:02.291 --> 13:03.289
- you see? See?
- No, you know what?

13:03.329 --> 13:05.631
- I am concerned about Pat.
- I'm a little concerned about Pat.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.025
- Fine.
- Ohh!

13:08.424 --> 13:10.562
That's my phone.

13:12.132 --> 13:13.625
You got a text.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.236
That ponytail looks so cute on you.

13:17.304 --> 13:18.536
You look just like Gloria Steinem

13:18.605 --> 13:20.858
when she infiltrated
the Playboy mansion.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.022
- You are fascinating, Chloe.
- Thank you.

13:23.047 --> 13:24.075
- Shannon.
- Bye, Shannon.

13:24.143 --> 13:25.877
I just read the latest copy
of the school newspaper.

13:25.945 --> 13:27.741
What happened to the big
take down of the Mat Maids?

13:27.766 --> 13:29.772
Turns out I was stereotyping them.

13:29.797 --> 13:31.921
They're great at discussing
different colors of lip gloss

13:31.946 --> 13:33.233
and the merits of NATO.

13:33.258 --> 13:35.386
So, you did a puff piece
on your brother instead?

13:35.454 --> 13:36.553
It's not a puff piece.

13:36.622 --> 13:37.855
He's doing something historic,

13:37.924 --> 13:39.857
something nobody at this
school has ever done.

13:39.926 --> 13:42.526
Yes, I will achieve
an undefeated season.

13:42.595 --> 13:44.395
Finally, some recognition.

13:44.463 --> 13:47.967
It almost makes up for your
locker gift, which is balls.

13:47.992 --> 13:49.633
Sylvia Plath is many things,

13:49.702 --> 13:51.402
but she is not balls.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.749
Also, the article isn't about you.

13:53.774 --> 13:55.578
It's about Kenny.

13:56.709 --> 13:59.576
"Local Gay Wrestler Puts
You In A 'Heartlock'"?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.149
Oh, Stop.

14:03.069 --> 14:04.536
Hey.

14:04.561 --> 14:06.127
- Have you seen this?
- Ugh, yeah.

14:06.152 --> 14:08.155
The way my bangs are curling
in the front, it's not great,

14:08.180 --> 14:09.561
but the piece is actually really nice.

14:09.586 --> 14:12.740
No. You're getting articles
and... and pudding and Chloe.

14:12.765 --> 14:14.092
Why do you have to take over everything?

14:14.117 --> 14:15.334
I'm not taking over anything.

14:15.359 --> 14:16.717
You're the one who asked me to do this.

14:16.742 --> 14:18.529
No, I asked you to take a dive.

14:18.554 --> 14:19.711
And now, we're headed to finals

14:19.736 --> 14:21.328
and all anybody can talk about is you.

14:21.353 --> 14:22.498
What?

14:22.523 --> 14:24.601
Wrestling is my thing.

14:24.626 --> 14:26.529
And you... you waltz in
and you win one match,

14:26.554 --> 14:28.652
and, all of a sudden, you're
a hero because you're gay.

14:28.677 --> 14:30.414
Okay, first of all, that wasn't a waltz.

14:30.439 --> 14:32.656
It was a Jerome
Robbins-inspired dance fight.

14:32.681 --> 14:34.658
And, secondly, I'm
not going to apologize

14:34.727 --> 14:35.993
for being good at a sport

14:36.018 --> 14:38.000
or for being recognized because I'm gay.

14:38.025 --> 14:40.764
Just imagine how you would
feel if I decided to be gay,

14:40.789 --> 14:41.998
and I was really good at it.

14:42.023 --> 14:43.453
And how would you be
"really good" at it?

14:43.478 --> 14:44.644
I don't know.

14:44.669 --> 14:47.604
By, like, anticipating a guy's needs.

14:47.629 --> 14:49.382
I think you're getting
upset over nothing.

14:49.407 --> 14:51.418
The only locker gift I got

14:51.443 --> 14:53.671
was this scrap of paper that says,

14:53.696 --> 14:55.203
"Look behind you."

14:55.228 --> 14:56.712
Sorry I'm late.

14:56.737 --> 14:58.604
I had to get your new

14:58.629 --> 14:59.615
Letterman's jacket.

14:59.684 --> 15:01.617
Chloe.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.591
Ooh.

15:05.159 --> 15:06.425
It's just a jacket.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.376
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

15:12.022 --> 15:13.655
And a tuba.

15:17.544 --> 15:19.301
And confetti.

15:23.154 --> 15:24.486
I'm glad you were strong enough

15:24.511 --> 15:26.138
to go to Jimmy and Kenny's meet.

15:26.163 --> 15:27.129
Yes, me too.

15:27.154 --> 15:28.120
But the pain meds you gave me...

15:28.189 --> 15:29.555
I don't think they're really working.

15:29.623 --> 15:30.722
Well, they're old.

15:30.791 --> 15:33.246
I got them in 2001
after Shannon was born.

15:33.271 --> 15:34.450
Turns out I didn't need them.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.732
After your C-section?

15:35.801 --> 15:37.901
I come from hearty stock. You know that.

15:37.926 --> 15:40.128
Growing up, my mother hated weakness.

15:40.153 --> 15:42.472
Whenever I got sick, she just
put a bucket next to the bed

15:42.541 --> 15:44.541
- and let me tough it out.
- Yes, I remember her saying,

15:44.609 --> 15:46.008
"Starve a cold, ignore a fever."

15:46.078 --> 15:48.216
Well, it works every time.

15:49.397 --> 15:50.770
You see?

15:50.815 --> 15:53.683
I don't have a caretaking
bone in my body.

15:53.751 --> 15:56.151
I'm so worried I'm
gonna blow it with Clive.

15:56.176 --> 15:57.792
Can you teach me, Pat?

15:57.817 --> 16:00.231
Teach me to be soft like you.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.325
Eh, I can probably show you...

16:03.394 --> 16:05.094
Searing pain!

16:09.601 --> 16:10.632
Bulldogs!

16:10.701 --> 16:12.201
Bulldogs are great!

16:12.269 --> 16:14.503
Bulldogs, Bulldogs, Bulldogs!

16:14.564 --> 16:16.145
The Bulldogs are great!

16:17.808 --> 16:19.566
Wow. It seems like
there's a lot of tension

16:19.591 --> 16:20.819
between your brothers.

16:20.844 --> 16:22.338
"Titus Andronicus" much?

16:22.363 --> 16:24.413
I don't totally
understand that reference.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.205
Just get it from the context clues.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.782
One, two, three.

16:27.807 --> 16:29.020
- Be aggressive,
- No.

16:29.045 --> 16:31.385
- be, be aggressive.
- It doesn't sound caring at all, okay?

16:31.454 --> 16:32.924
Now, listen, we're gonna try this again.

16:32.949 --> 16:34.690
I'll give you the symptom,
you give me the remedy.

16:34.715 --> 16:35.877
And you can't say, "bucket."

16:35.946 --> 16:38.070
- Throw one at me.
- My tummy hurts.

16:38.095 --> 16:40.127
You're a grown man.
You don't have a tummy.

16:40.152 --> 16:42.697
And I'm sorry, but the
answer for that is "bucket."

16:42.766 --> 16:43.885
Okay.

16:43.910 --> 16:44.987
Uh, I have a headache.

16:45.012 --> 16:46.700
Well, I know you want me to say,

16:46.769 --> 16:48.802
"Do you want an aspirin
and a cold compress?"

16:48.871 --> 16:50.704
But what I really want to say is

16:50.773 --> 16:53.121
"Boo-hoo, walk it off.
Get on with your life."

16:53.785 --> 16:56.191
Well, that is what you
told me to get me here.

16:56.216 --> 16:56.973
Mm-hmm.

16:56.998 --> 16:58.379
All right, Kenny, you're up.

16:58.448 --> 16:59.580
Just do your thing out there.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.387
You got this, okay?

17:03.537 --> 17:05.236
Yeah, Kenny!

17:07.425 --> 17:08.637
Shake hands.

17:11.393 --> 17:12.660
I'd like to forfeit.

17:12.728 --> 17:15.628
Uh, no, I'm replacing the kid with mono.

17:15.698 --> 17:17.829
I know. I read the article.

17:17.898 --> 17:20.027
I don't feel comfortable
wrestling someone like you.

17:20.835 --> 17:21.901
Why?

17:21.970 --> 17:23.569
He knows why.

17:27.622 --> 17:30.090
Bulldogs. Eagles forfeit.

17:31.547 --> 17:33.605
What's going on? Why
isn't Kenny wrestling?

17:38.167 --> 17:39.177
What happened?

17:39.202 --> 17:40.279
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

17:40.304 --> 17:42.295
Just go win and stay undefeated.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.986
Not until you tell me.

17:46.192 --> 17:48.709
He didn't want to wrestle
me because I'm gay.

17:49.597 --> 17:51.497
It's whatever. I'm not surprised.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.165
This is why I didn't want to
do this in the first place.

17:53.234 --> 17:55.834
- That's crazy.
- No, it's not that crazy, Jimmy.

17:55.903 --> 17:57.969
Nobody at our school really
cared about me being gay,

17:58.038 --> 18:00.138
but out there, things like
this happen all the time.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.395
Okay, Jimmy, you're up. Let's go.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.584
- I'm not wrestling.
- What?

18:11.412 --> 18:13.719
If they have a problem with
you, I have a problem with them.

18:13.787 --> 18:15.353
Come on, Jimmy.

18:15.378 --> 18:17.513
I've taken your spotlight
enough. Go have your moment.

18:17.545 --> 18:19.107
Oh, I will.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.627
Hey, guys, the other team
won't wrestle my brother

18:22.696 --> 18:24.482
because he's gay.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.298
Well, it turns out

18:27.323 --> 18:29.938
that they're the ones who are gay.

18:29.963 --> 18:32.451
- Jimmy...
- Not now, I'm having my moment.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.224
I'm gonna forfeit my match.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.209
Now, I know it seems like a small thing,

18:38.234 --> 18:39.700
but it's discrimination.

18:39.725 --> 18:43.115
And I, for one, am
not gonna stand for it.

18:43.263 --> 18:45.850
So you guys can do
whatever you want to do,

18:45.875 --> 18:47.428
but if something happens to Kenny,

18:47.453 --> 18:49.435
it happens to all of us.

18:49.591 --> 18:53.490
If he's gay, then we are all gay.

18:55.572 --> 18:56.536
I'm out.

18:56.962 --> 18:58.379
Now, I'm not gay,

18:58.404 --> 18:59.696
but I'm not gonna wrestle, either.

18:59.756 --> 19:01.521
Cool. Yeah, cool.

19:02.357 --> 19:04.238
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

19:04.263 --> 19:07.771
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

19:07.839 --> 19:09.066
Hey, by the way!

19:09.091 --> 19:10.917
Don't flatter yourself.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.208
You're not even his type.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.609
All right, guys, come on. We're out.

19:13.678 --> 19:15.623
Let's go. Come on.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.582
What about your season?

19:19.607 --> 19:21.263
It was great.

19:21.288 --> 19:23.301
I got to wrestle with my brother.

19:25.880 --> 19:26.967
Okay, you smell. Let's go.

19:26.992 --> 19:28.521
Yeah, I know.

19:29.494 --> 19:31.093
I am so proud of him.

19:31.162 --> 19:32.138
You know what?

19:32.163 --> 19:34.716
They're tough because
you didn't baby them.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.826
They get their strength from you.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.646
'Cause it clearly isn't me.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.483
Clean yourself up.

19:43.508 --> 19:45.607
- I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay.

19:47.267 --> 19:48.841
Jimmy.

19:51.115 --> 19:53.282
- Whoa!
- You could knock.

19:53.507 --> 19:55.207
You're Barklay the Bulldog?

19:55.232 --> 19:56.357
Do not tell anyone.

19:56.382 --> 19:58.559
You'd break a lot of kids' hearts
if they found out it was me.

19:58.584 --> 20:01.254
I've been leaving clues around
that it's Joyce the lunch lady.

20:01.279 --> 20:02.590
Look, I need to talk
with you about something.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.427
Could you put down the... dog head.

20:06.963 --> 20:09.582
Look, I am not the type of person

20:09.607 --> 20:11.098
who is going to sit at your bedside

20:11.123 --> 20:13.758
and wipe your brow or
any other part of you,

20:13.783 --> 20:16.332
and spoon-feed you soup, and...

20:16.357 --> 20:18.405
I'm not a coddler.

20:18.474 --> 20:20.407
And if that means you can't be with me,

20:20.476 --> 20:22.177
then I understand.

20:22.478 --> 20:24.145
But it's not who I am,

20:24.170 --> 20:26.020
and it's not who I want to be.

20:26.045 --> 20:29.316
It's not who I want you to be, either.

20:29.341 --> 20:31.352
I love how strong and direct you are.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.748
It's a major turn-on.

20:32.773 --> 20:37.646
And I would never want you
to change who you are for me.

20:39.466 --> 20:40.861
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:40.929 --> 20:42.904
the basketball team has
a game in five minutes.

20:42.929 --> 20:44.599
You never saw me!

20:47.035 --> 20:48.935
Why am I into him?

20:52.074 --> 20:53.254
You sure you wanna do this?

20:53.279 --> 20:55.184
One last time to show
you this was not a fluke.

20:55.232 --> 20:58.223
And then, I'm hanging up my singlet
until I take my first gay cruise.

20:58.248 --> 21:01.752
All right, I finally get
to see my boys wrestle.

21:01.777 --> 21:04.324
If one of you breaks an
arm, don't come crying to me.

21:04.349 --> 21:05.402
I'm warning you, Jimmy.

21:05.427 --> 21:07.147
The last time someone
underestimated me, I...

21:07.216 --> 21:08.847
Aah!

21:09.511 --> 21:11.338
Yeah, that's just how
I thought it would go.

21:11.378 --> 21:13.972
- Well, who's hungry?
- I could eat.

21:13.997 --> 21:15.822
- Kiss it.
- I'm an athlete.

21:15.891 --> 21:17.523
I'm an athlete!

21:17.593 --> 21:18.890
Mom, I need a bucket!
