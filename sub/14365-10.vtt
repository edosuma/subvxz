WEBVTT

00:05.346 --> 00:07.190
Ohh, my head gasket.

00:08.615 --> 00:09.704
What the...?

00:13.475 --> 00:17.204
The 'Cons warship?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

00:26.044 --> 00:30.485
Ratchet, don't ask how I got
here ... long story.

00:30.569 --> 00:33.376
Ratchet, you copy?

00:33.418 --> 00:34.758
Oh, scrap.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.875
Stealthy...

00:41.169 --> 00:43.766
Stealthy...

01:00.441 --> 01:01.405
Starscream?

01:01.405 --> 01:05.762
Why is it that every time I
return to my old stomping

01:05.846 --> 01:09.449
grounds, I find an Autobot
roaming the halls?

01:09.533 --> 01:12.759
Don't tell me you came
crawling back to Megatron.

01:12.801 --> 01:14.686
Hardly, now out of my way.

01:14.728 --> 01:17.787
Scream, you got to show me
the way off this boat.

01:17.871 --> 01:19.127
Sorry, too busy.

01:19.211 --> 01:23.275
- Look, when you needed help ...
- As I recall, we bartered.

01:23.317 --> 01:29.141
So unless you have anything of
value to offer me, step aside.

01:29.267 --> 01:31.026
The exit... now!

01:31.110 --> 01:36.515
I may have given Arcee a free
pass when she and I last met...

01:37.772 --> 01:43.176
...but I won't hesitate to skewer
you as I did a certain Cliffjumper.

01:54.195 --> 01:56.612
Perish, Bulkhead.

02:00.396 --> 02:04.260
This is for Cliffjumper!
For Bumblebee!

02:04.586 --> 02:06.877
For everything.

02:11.237 --> 02:14.073
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

03:04.165 --> 03:08.061
You left me no choice.

03:14.182 --> 03:17.995
What I would not give to have wings again.

03:17.977 --> 03:26.356
Ah, just as I left it ... the Harbinger.
Things are finally looking up.

03:34.149 --> 03:38.758
Oh, really?!
Not one scrap of Energon!

03:49.567 --> 03:53.505
A laboratory?

03:54.427 --> 03:56.983
And it's functional.

04:01.969 --> 04:04.895
Protoforms.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.716
Bulkhead to base.
Picked up a strong reading ...

04:16.757 --> 04:19.105
I'm gonna go check it out.

04:19.314 --> 04:20.906
Let's see.

04:20.990 --> 04:26.227
Transference of binary bonding,
submolecular infusion ...

04:26.269 --> 04:29.705
the formulas seem
straightforward enough.

04:29.746 --> 04:33.810
Well, my little lumps of clay, you
look like you're ripe for the molding.

04:33.894 --> 04:37.372
Let's give cloning a whirl, shall we?

04:45.961 --> 04:48.349
Uh, no sign of activity.

05:05.275 --> 05:08.836
Give me life!

05:59.406 --> 06:02.381
Scrap!

06:22.198 --> 06:26.472
Esteemed members of my
armada...

06:26.556 --> 06:30.997
You now stand upon the very
precipice of glory...

06:31.080 --> 06:36.443
to meet the destiny which I have
so tenaciously worked toward.

06:36.527 --> 06:40.046
Dynamic leadership of the
Decepticons.

06:40.088 --> 06:44.906
Eh, uh, I am delighted to
hear that we are on the same page.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.180
- We are as one, commander.
- We share your memories...

06:49.264 --> 06:55.129
- Your very feelings...
- Even your insatiable quest for power.

06:56.261 --> 07:00.953
I see.
Fortunately, the Harbinger's

07:01.037 --> 07:05.143
tracking systems have remained
synched with Megatron's warship.

07:05.268 --> 07:08.243
Of course, we shall require a
means of reaching the ...

07:11.846 --> 07:15.408
You can transform?
Eh, uh, of course, you can.

07:16.162 --> 07:19.346
How else would you fly to the ship?

07:19.388 --> 07:23.200
That was a test, which you all,
eh, passed.

07:23.284 --> 07:28.479
Now take flight and snuff
Megatron's accursed spark!

07:34.387 --> 07:38.870
Ohh, my head gasket.

07:38.870 --> 07:41.007
Spread out.
Keep to the shadows.

07:41.091 --> 07:44.861
Any one of us is an instant
target aboard this warship.

07:44.903 --> 07:48.758
But to be seen together would
sacrifice the element of surprise.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.570
Whoever manages to find Megatron
first, report your position.

08:08.784 --> 08:10.502
Starscream?

08:13.686 --> 08:20.013
I cannot wait to savor the
vivid details of Megatron's demise.

08:22.024 --> 08:24.412
What is happening?

08:24.496 --> 08:28.267
This is for Cliffjumper!
For Bumblebee!

08:28.350 --> 08:31.386
For everything.

08:34.509 --> 08:38.530
My genetic code provides my
clones with a T-cog I no longer

08:38.615 --> 08:42.302
possess, and all I get
is their agony?!

08:49.173 --> 08:51.813
A com unit.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.285
Bulkhead to base, do you read?

08:55.709 --> 08:56.631
Do you copy?

08:57.888 --> 09:01.784
Hey, what... you stupid com tech.
Is this thing even on?

09:32.244 --> 09:34.087
Halt!

09:41.209 --> 09:45.357
A Decepticon beacon.
At last.

09:56.544 --> 10:01.488
Devoted servants, the time has
come for the ultimate retribution.

10:10.549 --> 10:14.906
Optimus, no word yet from
Bulkhead, but I am detecting

10:14.990 --> 10:18.551
some rather curious subterranean
frequencies.

10:18.593 --> 10:20.227
Of earthly origin?

10:20.269 --> 10:24.542
I do not yet know what they are,
but I do know where.

10:26.302 --> 10:30.324
The coordinates at which we
last encountered Megatron.

10:30.324 --> 10:35.561
- And Airachnid.
- And Airachnid's Insecticon.

10:45.114 --> 10:49.052
<i>Arise, my armada, and attack!</i>

11:07.068 --> 11:12.724
We are in all likelihood witnessing the
launch of a mission to terminate Megatron.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.992
I can't think of a reason to stop that
even if we could.

11:16.034 --> 11:21.313
But we can stop Airachnid.

11:23.031 --> 11:26.927
Rear guard, engage the Autobots.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.475
Stealthy...

11:58.517 --> 11:59.816
Stealthy.

11:59.858 --> 12:03.336
<i>Lord Megatron.</i>

12:03.419 --> 12:04.844
Yes, what is it?

12:04.886 --> 12:06.185
<i>An intruder.</i>

12:06.268 --> 12:07.860
Autobot?

12:07.944 --> 12:11.799
<i>Starscream. He was last seen
in the vicinity of the bridge.</i>

12:45.861 --> 12:49.967
No!

13:00.232 --> 13:05.511
Underground ...
there's a surprise.

13:17.829 --> 13:24.658
Megatron, it has come time to
settle old scores.

13:26.166 --> 13:30.607
Really, Starscream?
All on your own?

13:30.649 --> 13:32.870
<i>Actually...</i>

13:42.432 --> 13:44.736
Clones?

13:44.820 --> 13:50.225
Well played, Starscream, if you're
even here among your underlings.

13:50.267 --> 13:53.702
Underlings?
We are as one.

13:53.786 --> 13:55.713
Though many.

13:55.797 --> 14:00.573
Bring me Starscream's head on
a stick, and I will reward you

14:00.615 --> 14:05.392
as my second in command ...
all of you.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.738
No!
You are trying to trick us!

14:07.780 --> 14:10.419
- Am I?
- Is he?

14:10.461 --> 14:13.436
Accept my proposal, and we all win.

14:13.478 --> 14:19.092
Otherwise, you will merely end up
terminating each other to get the spoils.

14:19.134 --> 14:21.271
It is your nature, after all.

14:21.312 --> 14:24.957
- Don't listen to him!
- Prepare to perish at my hand.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.089
<i>Our hands!</i>

14:26.131 --> 14:31.870
Yes, only our combined firepower
will assure Megatron's destruction.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.211
Take aim!

14:34.636 --> 14:36.018
Do you hear that?

14:49.216 --> 14:51.311
Ignore!
Fire on three.

14:51.353 --> 14:52.232
One...

14:52.274 --> 14:53.112
Two...

14:56.171 --> 14:58.266
What was that?

14:58.349 --> 15:01.576
The sound of the tables turning.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.134
What is going on up there?

15:23.739 --> 15:27.719
Exterminating you was so
gratifying the first three times.

15:41.587 --> 15:46.154
Airachnid.
A busy day for assassins.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.997
Arcee?

17:03.245 --> 17:07.602
When you extinguish my spark,
make it hurt.

17:07.644 --> 17:11.834
You know I would extend
that courtesy to you.

17:11.916 --> 17:14.598
- I'm not like you.
- Very well.

17:34.332 --> 17:36.302
No!

18:01.733 --> 18:06.635
<i>Forgive us, one true
Lord and master.</i>

18:06.761 --> 18:12.417
This day has certainly seen its share
of thwarted intentions.

18:43.006 --> 18:45.683
One way or another, I'm
getting off this boat.

18:55.814 --> 18:59.291
Now what?!

19:06.478 --> 19:08.489
Out of my way!

19:20.133 --> 19:24.326
My liege, our power cord has
been compromised.

19:24.368 --> 19:26.211
Prepare for landing.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.773
Stasis.
She deserves worse.

20:07.815 --> 20:12.005
I intended worse
more times than you know.

20:12.088 --> 20:14.686
You are stronger for the
choice you made.

20:18.582 --> 20:23.401
Guys, you are not gonna
believe the day I had.

20:27.758 --> 20:29.224
Oh, you too, huh?

20:40.327 --> 20:46.151
Lord Starscream, your most
loyal servant has returned, but

20:46.193 --> 20:52.100
I regret to inform you
that our collective mission has failed.

20:52.184 --> 20:57.295
Hmm, yes, I got that sense.
Something to do with...

20:57.379 --> 21:01.778
a throbbing ache in my side.

21:07.518 --> 21:12.169
You knew I would
attempt to terminate you.

21:12.169 --> 21:19.124
I feel your pain.
Really, I do.

21:24.731 --> 21:26.767
