is our lefts still need work.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.583
In order to maximize speed,

00:39.625 --> 00:42.291
we need to be totally in sync.

- True.

Nothing is gonna

01:17.291 --> 01:20.667

At least I didn't miscalculate

Just make sure

whatever it is

02:55.625 --> 02:57.583
you might do.

02:57.625 --> 02:58.917

03:01.000 --> 03:02.375

07:00.041 --> 07:03.000
- Robin's losing it!

07:04.750 --> 07:06.709
- Sleeve, sleeve,

07:04.750 --> 07:06.709
fold, press.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.959
Mae's the one

07:06.750 --> 07:08.959
who folds the best.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.041
You gotta stretch.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.041
I gotta fold.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.417
- Ah! Mommy likey

07:15.417 --> 07:18.417
early bedtime.

07:18.458 --> 07:19.959
- Well, Daddy hatey

07:18.458 --> 07:19.959
early rise time.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.375
So I gotta get some sleep.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.041
There's a lotta pressure

07:21.417 --> 07:24.041
on this race tomorrow.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.583
- I thought you told

07:24.083 --> 07:25.583
the kids no pressure.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.250
- I was using reverse psychology

07:25.625 --> 07:28.250
to keep the pressure off.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.041
- Okay, Tom, I don't

07:28.291 --> 07:30.041
think you understand

07:30.083 --> 07:31.417
what reverse psychology

07:30.083 --> 07:31.417
means.

07:31.458 --> 07:35.250
The reverse of no pressure

07:31.458 --> 07:35.250
is actually pressure.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.333
- Trust me, Anne,

07:39.375 --> 07:42.375
I think I know a thing

07:39.375 --> 07:42.375
or two about reserve psychology.

07:42.417 --> 07:45.834
- Anybody else stressed out

07:42.417 --> 07:45.834
that Dad said no pressure?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.417
- I'm freakin' out!

07:47.458 --> 07:51.041
- You know, Anne, if I hadn't

07:47.458 --> 07:51.041
gone into sporting goods...

07:51.083 --> 07:53.792
[exhales]

07:51.083 --> 07:53.792
I woulda gone into brains.

07:53.834 --> 07:57.000
- Dad's totally in my brain!

07:57.041 --> 07:59.083
- Let me, uh, give you

07:57.041 --> 07:59.083
a little taste

07:59.125 --> 08:01.959
of reverse psychology.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.667
Take as much blanket

08:02.000 --> 08:05.667
as you want.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.458
[chuckles]

08:13.417 --> 08:16.500
Now,<i> don't</i> give

08:13.417 --> 08:16.500
any blanket back.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.709
Anne?

08:21.750 --> 08:25.667
- [snoring]

08:25.709 --> 08:29.041
- I'm not cold.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.083
- 6 hours, 47 minutes

08:31.125 --> 08:33.041
if we fall asleep

08:31.125 --> 08:33.041
<i>right now!</i>

08:33.083 --> 08:35.417
- At least Dawn and Mae

08:33.083 --> 08:35.417
are sleeping.

08:35.458 --> 08:38.166
- Sleeve, sleeve,

08:35.458 --> 08:38.166
fold, press.

08:38.208 --> 08:41.000
- Dawn ain't gonna

08:38.208 --> 08:41.000
get no rest.

08:42.667 --> 08:43.500
- [shivering]

08:43.542 --> 08:46.250
[whispers]

08:43.542 --> 08:46.250
So...cold.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.250
- Your clock is fine!

08:48.291 --> 08:50.250
- [clicking] I just need to hear

08:48.291 --> 08:50.250
the click-click.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.959
- Uh, 6 hours, 46 minutes!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.417
- This race is so much pressure!

08:55.458 --> 08:57.792
I wonder if the Kramdens

08:55.458 --> 08:57.792
are feeling it?

08:57.834 --> 09:00.125
[snoring in sync]

09:02.667 --> 09:05.417
all: I've got to get

09:02.667 --> 09:05.417
some sleep.

09:08.291 --> 09:11.625
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

09:11.667 --> 09:13.500
- If we fall asleep

09:11.667 --> 09:13.500
<i>right now,</i>

09:13.542 --> 09:16.750
we'll get 4 hours

09:13.542 --> 09:16.750
and 45 minutes of sleep,

09:16.792 --> 09:17.709
which comes out to--

09:17.750 --> 09:20.291
- 17,100 seconds.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.291
- Yes...actually.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.709
How did you do that?

09:24.750 --> 09:27.250
- I don't know!

09:24.750 --> 09:27.250
But I'm on a roll.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.375
Ask me another question.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.375
- What's 5 plus 5?

09:29.417 --> 09:32.250
- 55!

09:29.417 --> 09:32.250
- The roll is over.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.208
- Eew! Dawn, what's that?

09:37.250 --> 09:38.417
- My foot.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.166
You were folding

09:38.458 --> 09:40.166
laundry so long,

09:40.208 --> 09:42.458
I have to do

09:40.208 --> 09:42.458
my relaxation stretch again.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.417
- If you're nervous...

09:44.458 --> 09:46.750
the fifth quad is here

09:44.458 --> 09:46.750
to fill in for you.

09:46.792 --> 09:50.667
- I got this, Mae.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.709
- Well, if we're gonna

09:50.709 --> 09:52.709
get some sleep,

09:52.750 --> 09:54.834
I'm gonna have to put

09:52.750 --> 09:54.834
my foot down.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.667
Put your foot down!

09:56.709 --> 09:59.875
- This is way better

09:56.709 --> 09:59.875
than a blanket.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.625
Who's the reverse

10:01.500 --> 10:04.625
psychologist now?

10:04.667 --> 10:06.500
- [snoring]

10:06.542 --> 10:08.125
[ziiii--]

10:10.667 --> 10:12.375
- Stupid blanket!

10:13.917 --> 10:15.917
Oh...she looks like

10:13.917 --> 10:15.917
such an angel

10:15.959 --> 10:18.000
when she's sleeping.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.125
Whoa!

10:19.166 --> 10:20.917
Freakishly strong angel!

10:20.959 --> 10:22.083
Whoa!

10:20.959 --> 10:22.083
[thud]

10:22.125 --> 10:23.125
Uhh!

10:23.166 --> 10:25.166
[groans]

10:25.208 --> 10:27.417
Owwwwww!

10:28.959 --> 10:30.792
[cranking]

10:30.834 --> 10:32.250
- What is that?

10:32.291 --> 10:34.250
- It's my backup clock.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.500
- Why do you need

10:34.291 --> 10:36.500
a backup clock?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.291
- In case

10:36.542 --> 10:38.291
there's a power outage.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.417
- Well, right now,

10:38.333 --> 10:40.417
we're having a sleep outage,

10:40.458 --> 10:41.709
and if we don't get

10:40.458 --> 10:41.709
some sleep,

10:41.750 --> 10:43.500
we'll never win the race.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.500
- Well, if we don't

10:43.542 --> 10:45.500
wake up on time,

10:45.542 --> 10:48.625
then we'll never make it

10:45.542 --> 10:48.625
<i>to</i> the race!

10:48.667 --> 10:51.250
So if you don't mind,

10:48.667 --> 10:51.250
I need to wind!

10:51.291 --> 10:53.792
[cranking]

10:51.291 --> 10:53.792
Wind, wind, wind, wind.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.834
Wind.

10:55.875 --> 10:56.959
There. Done.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
- Finally!

11:00.166 --> 11:02.208
[cranking]

11:00.166 --> 11:02.208
- Wind, wind, wind, wind.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.375
Wind.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.834
- I thought you said

11:03.417 --> 11:05.834
you were done!

11:05.875 --> 11:08.166
- This is my backup

11:05.875 --> 11:08.166
backup clock.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.500
- Get out!

11:08.208 --> 11:10.500
- No, seriously.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.208
I actually have

11:10.542 --> 11:13.208
a backup backup clock.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.750
- No, seriously...

11:14.792 --> 11:16.375
Ricky: Get out!

11:14.792 --> 11:16.375
Dicky: Get out!

11:16.417 --> 11:18.625
- You guys asleep?

11:18.667 --> 11:19.875
[door thuds closed]

11:19.917 --> 11:21.458
- Don't you knock?

11:21.500 --> 11:24.250
- Well, no,

11:21.500 --> 11:24.250
in case you were asleep.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.250
I need to crash here.

11:26.291 --> 11:30.667
- Whatever.

11:26.291 --> 11:30.667
Just be quiet about it.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.125
- Don't worry about me.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.709
I'm no Chatman.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.250
- Who?

11:35.291 --> 11:38.667
- It's a boys' room thing.

11:35.291 --> 11:38.667
Ricky is Robin.

11:38.709 --> 11:43.125
- What goes on in there?

11:38.709 --> 11:43.125
- Everybody go to sleep!

11:44.625 --> 11:48.917
- Won't hear another

11:44.625 --> 11:48.917
peep outta me.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.083
No more peeps.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.625
I am done peeping.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.166
Sorry, just one more peep.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.583
- [groans] Ugh!

11:55.208 --> 11:57.583
Again with that tuna melt!

11:57.625 --> 11:59.583
- Where can I plug in

11:57.625 --> 11:59.583
my clock?

11:59.625 --> 12:03.500
- You don't need a clock.

11:59.625 --> 12:03.500
I have a clock.

12:03.542 --> 12:06.291
- Yeah, but I need

12:03.542 --> 12:06.291
the click-click of my clock.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.083
- What about your other

12:06.333 --> 12:08.083
two clocks?

12:08.125 --> 12:09.750
- They don't

12:08.125 --> 12:09.750
click-click.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.208
- Then what do they do?

12:11.250 --> 12:12.667
- They ticktock.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.375
They're ticktock clocks.

12:14.417 --> 12:17.250
They're not click-click

12:14.417 --> 12:17.250
clocks!

12:17.291 --> 12:20.500
- Now you're

12:17.291 --> 12:20.500
just sounding cuckoo!

12:20.542 --> 12:23.709
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.709
I forgot my cuckoo clock.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.750
- No more clocks!

12:25.792 --> 12:26.875
- [moans]

12:26.917 --> 12:29.000
- Fine! The outlet

12:26.917 --> 12:29.000
is over there!

12:29.041 --> 12:31.583
- [squeals]

12:31.625 --> 12:32.834
- Ugghhh!

12:32.875 --> 12:35.333
- Just go fold it!

12:32.875 --> 12:35.333
- [squeaks]

12:37.417 --> 12:38.917
- Click-click...

12:38.959 --> 12:40.125
- Fold, fold.

12:40.166 --> 12:43.417
- We are never going

12:40.166 --> 12:43.417
to win the gold.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.083
- Nicky's gone.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.917
Finally,

12:45.125 --> 12:46.917
some peace and quiet.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.333
I need my brain sleep.

12:48.375 --> 12:51.083
Entry velocity

12:48.375 --> 12:51.083
doesn't calculate itself.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.125
Good night.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.291
- Good night.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.625
Ricky?

12:57.667 --> 13:00.875
Why do you think

12:57.667 --> 13:00.875
they call it a bobsled?

13:00.917 --> 13:03.750
- I have no idea.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.750
Good night.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.166
- Ricky?

13:07.208 --> 13:09.625
Why don't they call it

13:07.208 --> 13:09.625
a Jeff-sled

13:09.667 --> 13:11.166
or a Benjamin-sled?

13:11.208 --> 13:14.333
- I don't know!

13:11.208 --> 13:14.333
Good night!

13:15.917 --> 13:18.542
- Ricky?

13:15.917 --> 13:18.542
- What's with the questions?!

13:18.583 --> 13:20.125
- Can't sleep.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.750
- Well, try counting sheep.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.041
- One sheep.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.875
Two sheep...

13:26.083 --> 13:28.875
- To yourself.

13:32.291 --> 13:33.750
- One sheep, Dicky.

13:33.792 --> 13:37.333
Two sheep, Dicky.

13:37.375 --> 13:40.959
- [muffled shouting]

13:37.375 --> 13:40.959
I miss Nicky!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.125
- I almost got it.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.500
Oh, no, no.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.500
Oh, no, no--no!

13:46.542 --> 13:49.375
Ugh!

13:46.542 --> 13:49.375
[thud]

13:49.417 --> 13:52.333
Found the other one!

13:52.375 --> 13:54.959
- [loud snoring]

13:55.000 --> 13:59.625
Is what I would sound like

13:55.000 --> 13:59.625
if I were really asleep.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.000
- [whack]

13:59.667 --> 14:02.000
- What was that?

14:02.041 --> 14:05.417
- [calmly] Just thinking

14:02.041 --> 14:05.417
about something.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.792
- Are you guys asleep?

14:07.834 --> 14:08.917
- [snores]

14:08.959 --> 14:12.792
No. But doesn't it

14:08.959 --> 14:12.792
sound like it?

14:12.834 --> 14:14.208
- [whack]

14:14.250 --> 14:18.250
- No. It sounds like

14:14.250 --> 14:18.250
you guys are goofing off in here

14:18.291 --> 14:20.750
and not taking this race

14:18.291 --> 14:20.750
seriously.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.417
We are gonna lose

14:20.792 --> 14:22.417
to those Kramdens

14:22.458 --> 14:23.959
and let Mom and Dad down.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.792
- How dare you walk in here

14:24.000 --> 14:27.792
with these accusations!

14:27.834 --> 14:30.250
Is what I would sound like

14:27.834 --> 14:30.250
if I were Ricky.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.667
- Well, excuse me...

14:30.291 --> 14:32.667
[whack]

14:32.709 --> 14:33.875
if I care...

14:32.709 --> 14:33.875
[whack]
