07:11.916 --> 07:14.291
I can't stop thinking about
that ship that disappeared.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.458
Do you think it sank?

07:16.541 --> 07:19.250
That's the only explanation.
Otherwise they'd have found it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.875
It makes me uneasy to travel
on a ship from the same company.

07:22.958 --> 07:25.708
But what are the chances of two ships
from the same company

07:25.791 --> 07:27.250
sinking one after the other?

07:27.333 --> 07:28.333
Don't you think?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.333
Are you listening to me, Lucien?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.416
Why would one need so many knives?

07:40.625 --> 07:41.791
I don't know.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.375
Just pretend you know what you are doing.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.500
Hurry up and eat. Just play along.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.583
Lucien?

07:55.916 --> 07:57.166
Whatever you say.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.458
Waiter.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.125
More.

08:34.791 --> 08:36.291
Don't you think you've had enough?

08:36.375 --> 08:38.291
The problem is that you're a fucking bore.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.083
Ángel, lower your voice.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.416
"Ángel, lower your voice.
Ángel, calm down."

08:42.500 --> 08:45.208
None of these poor bastards
understands a word I'm saying.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.458
Why should I?

11:07.666 --> 11:09.666
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:15.583 --> 11:16.791
Excuse me.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.833
We need help.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.625
Uh, we need a…

11:22.208 --> 11:23.666
a doctor.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.500
My… My sister…

11:26.916 --> 11:29.208
A doctor? A doctor?

11:30.708 --> 11:33.750
She needs… We don't know what to do.
We need a doctor.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.166
I'm begging you.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.250
She's dying.
We don't know what to do. I'm begging.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.833
She's dying. I'm begging you.

11:44.916 --> 11:46.125
I am begging you!

11:46.708 --> 11:48.541
A doctor! We need a doctor!

11:48.625 --> 11:50.250
Let go of me! Stop!

11:50.875 --> 11:52.083
Help us!

11:54.291 --> 11:56.625
A doctor! You're killing her!

11:56.708 --> 11:57.708
We need a doctor!

12:12.208 --> 12:14.666
We need a doctor.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.083
Shut up.

12:26.708 --> 12:28.666
You don't belong up here, creep.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.916
Next time, I'll throw you overboard.

12:31.000 --> 12:31.875
Got it?

13:03.666 --> 13:05.125
Are you a doctor?

13:07.083 --> 13:08.583
Okay. Come.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.291
This way.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.291
Seven.

13:38.041 --> 13:39.666
Get it out of me!

13:39.750 --> 13:41.000
Get it out now!

13:42.125 --> 13:43.333
She thinks the baby is dead.

13:43.416 --> 13:44.791
Who is that, Krester?

13:44.875 --> 13:47.791
Why did you bring her?
You idiot. We don't need help.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.208
No. This is wrong.
We don't even know who or what she is.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.291
You must do something.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.791
I think she wants to turn the baby.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.750
No. No. This is wrong.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.875
Do something.
She's going to kill it. It's God's child.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.083
-Anker!
-What do you want me to do?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Thanks.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.125
Maybe if you helped,

17:42.708 --> 17:45.958
instead of lying there, playing dead.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.166
Are you telling me this is my fault?

17:53.166 --> 17:55.625
Stop your little act. It's pretentious.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.166
Your parents aren't around anymore.
It's fine.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.333
You don't love me. You never did.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.416
This is not a marriage.
It's an arrangement.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.291
So you can stop pretending.

18:37.708 --> 18:38.958
Thanks a lot.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.333
For helping my sister.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.916
When I grow up,
I want to be a doctor just like you.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Thanks.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.541
Do you have children?

19:22.708 --> 19:23.666
Here.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.333
This is all we have.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.375
Did you get lost?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.291
Captain!

21:35.541 --> 21:37.958
Captain, you have to see this.

21:46.541 --> 21:49.208
For 20 minutes,
we've been receiving the same signal.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.083
I think it's from the lost ship.

21:56.875 --> 21:57.958
The Prometheus.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.458
Forty-four. Fifty-seven.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.041
Fifty-nine. Sixty.

22:36.791 --> 22:38.916
They're just sending these coordinates.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.291
Over and over. Nothing else.

22:41.916 --> 22:44.000
We can't be sure it's the Prometheus.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.000
How far away are we?

22:52.666 --> 22:54.166
We're right here.

22:54.250 --> 22:55.541
At 18 knots.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.458
This is odd.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.125
If they drifted off course
four months ago,

23:08.208 --> 23:11.666
the current should have taken them
north of their route, not south.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.750
How did they end up here?

23:20.458 --> 23:22.250
Approximately seven hours.

23:23.875 --> 23:27.750
We're changing course.
New destination. 42.4 north.

23:27.833 --> 23:30.166
44.57 west.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.458
Reduce speed to nine knots.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.958
Prepare for turning.
Bring rudder angle to 20 degrees port.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.833
New course, 230 degrees.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.875
Twenty degrees port side. 230 degrees.

23:44.958 --> 23:45.791
SLOW

23:57.458 --> 23:59.041
Why are we turning?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.083
Where are we going?

24:28.541 --> 24:31.291
It's as though
you want everyone to find out, Ángel.

24:31.916 --> 24:33.708
Can't you be a little more careful?

24:34.458 --> 24:36.041
-More careful?
-I'm just saying…

24:36.125 --> 24:39.041
Don't you think it would be better
to attract less attention?

24:39.125 --> 24:43.583
Do you know what the big difference is
between you and I, dear brother?

24:45.125 --> 24:46.458
I have no fear.

24:47.458 --> 24:48.833
And you're consumed by it.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.291
Why don't you have a little chat with God?

24:53.541 --> 24:55.708
Ask him why he turned you into a sheep

24:56.583 --> 24:57.875
and me into a wolf.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.833
What's happening?

25:04.083 --> 25:05.041
I don't know.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
What's happening?

25:10.125 --> 25:11.125
It's turning.

25:12.541 --> 25:13.625
It's turning.

25:14.916 --> 25:16.458
Don't be ridiculous. Why would it turn?

25:16.541 --> 25:18.416
The goddamn ship is turning!

25:22.541 --> 25:23.958
Do you think we're going back?

25:24.041 --> 25:26.291
No, this can't be happening.
We can't go back.

25:26.375 --> 25:28.583
Dear Lord, please don't let us go back.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.541
We can't go back.

25:35.875 --> 25:36.708
I can't.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.208
Tove?

25:50.791 --> 25:53.250
Tove. Tove, wake up.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.208
Are you awake?

26:05.333 --> 26:06.750
Where are the others?

26:07.625 --> 26:09.708
They're all outside, looking for the ship.

26:10.416 --> 26:11.416
What ship?

26:11.500 --> 26:13.250
The one that got lost at sea.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.750
-What are you talking about?
-They turned our ship around.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.291
They got a signal
from the other ship that is lost.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.625
They turned our ship around?

26:24.208 --> 26:25.375
Are we going back?

26:25.458 --> 26:26.500
No, silly.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.375
I already told you.
They're looking for that lost ship.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.583
Remember the story of the ghost ship
that you told me once?

26:37.458 --> 26:40.916
Where the passengers had all sinned
because they killed a whale.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.166
And the spirits of the sea got so angry,

26:44.250 --> 26:47.375
they sent a huge storm
towards the ship and caused black waves.

26:47.958 --> 26:51.666
And when they woke up the next morning,
they had all turned into shadows.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.208
Maybe that's what happened
to that other ship.

26:55.291 --> 26:57.208
Imagine there's only shadows on board.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.916
Stop that nonsense.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.875
And don't let Mother and Father hear it.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.625
You hear me?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.041
Captain.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.208
There you are.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.875
What are you so worked up about?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.375
What does it matter to you if we arrive
in New York a couple of days late?

34:11.250 --> 34:12.250
Lucien?

35:02.583 --> 35:03.458
I'm sorry.

35:04.041 --> 35:05.375
I am very sorry, sir.

35:05.458 --> 35:08.583
I know I am not allowed in here.
I was just having a break.

35:08.666 --> 35:09.583
Stay.

35:09.666 --> 35:10.708
I will go now.

35:11.291 --> 35:12.208
Stay.

35:13.083 --> 35:16.333
I don't want to hurt you. I'm hungry.

35:18.583 --> 35:19.666
The bread.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.416
Your name?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
What's your name?

35:41.833 --> 35:43.750
I am Jérôme.

35:46.000 --> 35:46.916
You?

35:50.083 --> 35:51.083
Olek.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.958
Ship ahead!

38:05.041 --> 38:06.041
Ship ahead!

38:40.250 --> 38:43.208
Captain, with all due respect,

38:44.625 --> 38:46.083
we should get back on course.

38:46.166 --> 38:49.875
As soon as we have radio contact,
we inform the company about the position.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.708
We'll lower a lifeboat.

38:52.541 --> 38:56.833
But that's insane.
We should contact the company first.

38:58.375 --> 39:01.041
Captain, the first mate is right.

39:07.833 --> 39:10.166
You'll be in charge of the bridge
during my absence.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.375
This is against regulations.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.708
You're in command of the ship.
You can't just…

39:20.958 --> 39:23.000
The three of you, come with me.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.458
Try to reach the company again.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.916
Let them know
that we've found the Prometheus.

39:44.041 --> 39:45.208
What are you waiting for?

39:59.833 --> 40:01.333
It's the captain.

40:07.666 --> 40:08.666
Captain?

40:10.708 --> 40:12.416
Shouldn't we take the priest with us?

40:12.916 --> 40:16.125
I'm just saying. We have no idea
what awaits us over there, and--

40:16.208 --> 40:17.541
What's he saying?

40:18.916 --> 40:21.000
I think they want you to go with them.

40:21.083 --> 40:22.083
Where?

40:22.166 --> 40:23.291
To the lost ship.

40:23.375 --> 40:26.250
-Why would they want me?
-You're a priest, remember?

40:27.375 --> 40:29.291
-I don't speak their language.
-Yeah.

40:30.875 --> 40:32.625
-Your name.
-Ramiro.

40:33.833 --> 40:34.875
Father Ramiro.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.041
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.000
What are you doing here?

41:18.625 --> 41:19.458
I…

41:21.000 --> 41:21.958
He…

41:22.041 --> 41:24.666
Are you new? I haven't seen you before.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.916
You know crew aren't allowed out here.

41:30.541 --> 41:31.958
Get back to your post.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.125
Are you deaf?

41:34.208 --> 41:35.666
Get back to your post!

41:37.458 --> 41:39.583
Franz, lower the lifeboat.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.041
Why is the sea so still?

41:42.750 --> 41:43.875
There's no wind anymore.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.375
You know what they say.

41:47.791 --> 41:49.916
The sea knows when death is nearby.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.666
He's right. Something is wrong.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.416
Why aren't they responding?
Why aren't there any lights?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.541
I'm not going there.

42:01.416 --> 42:02.291
You.

42:05.666 --> 42:06.958
What's your name?

42:07.041 --> 42:08.166
Olek.

42:17.750 --> 42:19.458
You two are coming with me.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.375
Can I have one?

43:25.291 --> 43:26.666
May I have one, please?

43:56.041 --> 43:56.958
What?

43:57.458 --> 43:58.875
You don't want it anymore?

44:08.291 --> 44:09.250
Thanks.

44:14.625 --> 44:16.500
I saw you before in the dining hall.

44:18.291 --> 44:19.708
You've got an interesting face.

44:23.625 --> 44:24.750
It's odd, but…

44:27.416 --> 44:28.541
that scar there…

44:37.791 --> 44:39.458
it almost suits you.

45:26.458 --> 45:27.625
Hello!

45:28.125 --> 45:29.291
Anyone there?

45:31.625 --> 45:32.500
Hello!

45:36.500 --> 45:37.541
Wait for us.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.208
If we're not back in an hour, get help.

45:40.791 --> 45:42.125
You first.

45:54.958 --> 45:57.041
I've been part of your crew for 12 years.

45:58.708 --> 46:00.375
He ranks lower than me.

46:01.791 --> 46:02.791
He should stay.

46:03.291 --> 46:04.541
No, you stay here.

46:04.625 --> 46:05.875
One hour.

46:07.125 --> 46:08.416
Then go and get help.

47:17.541 --> 47:18.625
It stopped.

47:19.500 --> 47:20.500
What stopped?

47:20.583 --> 47:22.625
The coordinates.
They stopped sending them.

47:29.625 --> 47:32.083
They must have seen us then, surely?

47:35.958 --> 47:36.833
Perhaps.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.958
Where is everyone?

48:32.041 --> 48:33.750
What happened here?

49:38.500 --> 49:40.250
Nothing will change.

49:40.916 --> 49:42.875
We stick to our plan.

49:46.708 --> 49:50.416
I can't stand wearing this makeup
and this costume anymore.

49:51.125 --> 49:54.625
If you had just accepted your fate,
none of this would have happened.

49:54.708 --> 49:55.875
You're hurting me.

49:58.791 --> 50:00.041
Well, life hurts.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.666
You should practice your Japanese.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.333
Would you like to dance?

50:13.041 --> 50:14.541
Would you like to dance?

50:15.791 --> 50:17.333
Would you like to dance?

50:17.875 --> 50:19.125
To dance?

50:19.208 --> 50:20.375
To dance?

50:23.916 --> 50:24.958
To dance?

50:25.500 --> 50:27.458
Nice to meet you.

50:27.541 --> 50:29.166
Nice to meet you.

50:30.583 --> 50:33.791
We only have to pretend
for a little while longer.

50:35.208 --> 50:36.125
Remember…

50:37.000 --> 50:39.375
Everything will be okay in the end.

50:39.875 --> 50:42.708
If it's not okay, it's not the end.

50:45.333 --> 50:47.375
I'm much obliged.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.166
Hello?

52:26.375 --> 52:27.625
Anyone here?

52:53.875 --> 52:55.291
What's she doing?

53:22.125 --> 53:23.458
What was that?

53:27.916 --> 53:30.083
Oh my God. Please don't do this to me.

53:36.500 --> 53:38.958
Hey, are you crazy?

53:39.041 --> 53:40.791
You don't know what's in there!

53:56.333 --> 53:57.541
Oh my God.
