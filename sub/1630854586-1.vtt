[narrator] <i>Jason Bateman and Maya Rudolph</i>
<i>are about to guest star</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:12.178
<i>on the </i>Murderville Christmas Special.

00:12.262 --> 00:17.684
<i>But here's the catch, everyone</i>
<i>has been given a script... except them.</i>

00:17.767 --> 00:21.354
Hi, my name's Jason Bateman.
I am here doing <i>Murderville.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:22.772
I'm Maya Rudolph.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.275
I'm about to do <i>Murderville.</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:27.736
I have been given no script.

00:27.819 --> 00:32.073
-I have not been given a script.
-What I know is next to nothing.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.659
I love that I didn't have to
learn any lines.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.162
[Jason] <i>I've seen no actors.</i>
<i>I've seen no sets.</i>

00:37.245 --> 00:40.040
I'm going to have to figure out
who the murderer is.

00:40.123 --> 00:44.210
<i>And that makes me nervous.</i>
<i>So, I don't know who's here,</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:47.881
what's happening... [chuckles]
...and what I'm going to do,

00:47.964 --> 00:50.049
which I'm delighted by.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.853
[Terry] <i>The holidays,</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:05.899
<i>a magical time each year</i>
<i>when we set aside our differences</i>

01:05.982 --> 01:10.487
<i>and unite around one common belief,</i>
<i>that Christmas sucks ass.</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:15.658
<i>At least that's what I used to think.</i>
<i>My name is Terry Seattle.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:18.661
<i>I'm a senior homicide detective</i>
<i>with a failed marriage</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:21.581
<i>and moderate to severe</i>
<i>plaque psoriasis.</i>

01:21.664 --> 01:26.920
<i>And this is a story of one magical night,</i>
<i>when my whole world changed.</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:29.214
Bingo.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.008

-[grunts]

01:36.179 --> 01:37.388
[groans]

01:38.848 --> 01:41.643
-What is it Rhonda-slash-Chief?
<i>-Merry Christmas, Terry.</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:44.103
Is it? Is it a merry Christmas?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.397
<i>I'll be quick, 'cause I'm in</i>
<i>Hawaii with Daz,</i>

01:46.481 --> 01:48.191
<i>we booked paddle boarding lessons.</i>

01:48.274 --> 01:50.777
Did I forget to cash
an alimony check again?

01:50.860 --> 01:52.946
<i>Yes, but that's not why I'm calling.</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:55.907
<i>Mayor Palmer's hosting</i>
<i>City Hall's annual holiday party,</i>

01:55.990 --> 01:57.492
<i>and there's been a mix up.</i>

01:57.575 --> 02:01.121
<i>She needs someone to run security details,</i>
<i>so get down there ASAP.</i>

02:01.246 --> 02:04.082
Just 'cause I hate Christmas,
doesn't mean I want to work.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.626
Besides, one person
can't handle that event.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.129
<i>-Which is why I got you a new partner.</i>
-What?

02:09.212 --> 02:10.505
No. Chief, come on!

02:10.588 --> 02:12.090
-[doorbell rings]
-[groans]

02:12.173 --> 02:14.092
<i>I'll text you the details. Have fun!</i>

02:14.175 --> 02:17.595
I hope you fall off the paddle board,
then sharks circle you.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.348
-But don't eat... Ah, she hung up.
-[doorbell rings]

02:20.431 --> 02:22.308
I heard you the first time.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.394
[sighs]

02:26.938 --> 02:28.022
Hey.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.943
Well, if it isn't the Ghost
of Christmas ass.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.486
That's not complimentary.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.363
-Good to see you.
-Come on in.

02:35.446 --> 02:39.200
You are Detective Seattle perhaps,
I hope.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.244
Look at this guy,
already got questions.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.954
-Pop a seat right here.
-Yep.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.582
-Can I come around?
-I wish you would.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.875
Hi.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.503
-[sighs]
-Is this breakfast?

02:50.670 --> 02:54.173
-You always talk when you're nervous?
-[laughs]

02:54.257 --> 02:56.384
-Let's start with the basics.
-Okay.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.927
-What's your name?
-Jason.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.889
-Bateman.
-Okay.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.100
What's your profession before
you became a homicide trainee?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.144
I used to be an actor. I'm looking for

03:06.227 --> 03:07.979
-a career change.
-Kicked out?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.397
-No, not kicked out.
-Close?

03:09.480 --> 03:13.401
-No, it was totally voluntary.
-What kind of roles would you play?

03:13.484 --> 03:16.696
Just a normal, average, dumb white guy.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.156
-That makes sense.
-Sorry?

03:18.239 --> 03:21.159
You come waltzing in here,
thinking you can do my job.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.327
-No.
-I don't...

03:22.410 --> 03:25.079
-You ever worked security before?
-No, I have not.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.833
I got three callbacks for one
security part, but didn't get that one.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.418
-Like a commercial?
-Huh?

03:30.501 --> 03:31.669
No, no. How dare you.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.839
We're gonna be working
a security detail down at City Hall.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.966
Number one thing
is threat assessment.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.676
Think you'd be good at that?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.971
-Well, I--
-See any threat around you right now?

03:42.430 --> 03:45.099
-I see a lot of VHS tapes.
-Jason Bateman,

03:45.183 --> 03:48.937
do you see any other kind of threat
other than these items?

03:49.020 --> 03:51.272
Is there anything threatening to you?

03:52.190 --> 03:55.193
-Nothing at all in front of me.
-Huh.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.570
-[door slams open]
-[chainsaw whirring]

03:57.654 --> 03:59.489
[Terry yelling]

04:01.616 --> 04:04.494
Sit down!
Sit down!

04:06.746 --> 04:07.830
You see that?

04:07.914 --> 04:10.959
You did not assess the threat!
Sit down!

04:11.042 --> 04:14.128
You let a raving lunatic into my home!

04:14.212 --> 04:18.007
Lucky for you, it was
my former trainee, Marshawn Lynch.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.260
-Holy. Good Lord.
-Shit!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.220
-Big fan.
-The best damn

04:22.303 --> 04:24.931
homicide trainee I ever had.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.643
-You did not assess the threat.
-He wasn't in the room yet.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.397
Exactly. You should be thinking
about outside of the room.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.441
-Is there more trouble outside?
-You tell us.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.528
Is everybody going to die?
Are we going to die

04:38.611 --> 04:41.572
-in your hands, Jason Bateman?
-I don't want that to happen.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.701
-How can I help?
-You gotta stay alive.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.661
-Okay.
-Put your face in here.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.621
Look at this guy. Listen to him.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.375
-Shit, that is the fucking <i>Ozark </i>dude.
-Thank you.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.669
[Terry pants]

04:54.752 --> 04:56.879
-You're the best.
-No problem, Chief.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.299
Make yourself at home,
whatever you want.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.592
-That's it for him?
-He's going to chill out.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.720
It's Christmas.
Let's get out of here.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.305
-Let's do it.
-[phone chimes]

05:05.388 --> 05:08.891
-All right, hang on a second. Uh-oh.
-[Jason chuckles]

05:08.975 --> 05:11.060
This is just
something from the chief here.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.604
What size booties do you wear?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.649
[Terry] <i>Turns out the holiday party</i>
<i>was short an elf,</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:19.402
<i>so Jason was pressed</i>
<i>into emergency service.</i>

05:19.485 --> 05:23.364
<i>Little did we know his job would soon go</i>
<i>from spreading cheer,</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:25.199
<i>to solving murder.</i>

05:25.283 --> 05:26.534
Look at this.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.037
-They smudged their names.
-Pretty smeary.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.998
[Terry] Amateur hour.
You guys never heard of a Sharpie?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.293
You ready?
How you feeling? Feeling good?

05:35.376 --> 05:37.253
I'm happy now. We're at a party.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.756
Good. The Mayor said that
she needed Santa's elf

05:39.839 --> 05:42.467
as a helper, I wanna know
you're here to help.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.552
-Are you here to help?
-I'm here to help.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.637
Are you getting into a holiday outfit?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.432
I need you looking alive,
looking for threats.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.392
Look at all these presents. Wow!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.227
These are incredible.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.022
What, do we just
grab one of these... Angus?

05:56.105 --> 05:59.984
Angie, and no.
This toy drive is for the local orphanage.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.820
Later, Santa will deliver
the gifts to the kids.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.907
Oh my gosh! Noise canceling headphones!
These are the best.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.826
-You ever used these before?
-I'd love some right now.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.787
-They cancel out the noise.
-Yep.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.955
-Can I have these?
-[Angie] Absolutely not.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.875
-Each present is for a specific orphan.
-Wow.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.504
These orphans, parents die
and people just give you presents?

06:19.587 --> 06:22.673
Wish my parents had just died like that.
[quietly] Grab those.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.592
-Three presents?
-No, these.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.260
Stuff 'em in. In your vest.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.554
I've always wanted a pair of these.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.474
You got it? Zip 'em right in there.
That looks good.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.434
-Detective.
-Mayor Palmer, how are you?

06:33.518 --> 06:36.270
Detective Seattle, thank you
for coming on short notice.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.814
And you must be?

06:39.398 --> 06:42.693
-Jason, trainee.
-How good are you, Jason?

06:42.777 --> 06:45.029
-I can be the best, the best ever.
-Great.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.031
You're practiced at being an elf?

06:47.115 --> 06:50.535
I feel like I've got the outfit on
and ready to go.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.663
Do you have, like, a...
maybe, like, an elf dance?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.540
That'd be great.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.083
Yeah, let's see that.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.835
-Okay.
-[Terry] And sort make,

06:58.918 --> 07:01.129
-like a song, an original song.
-Yeah.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.964
-Caw caw caw!
-That'd be--

07:04.257 --> 07:05.883
-[Terry chuckles]
-Not mine.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.218
-[Terry] Hang on.
-Wow.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.303
Sorry, I brought these for the orphans.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.889
They look like
the one you had before.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.141
-Damn it.
-Ready?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.268
-Let's do it.
-Come here, listen to Santa.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.894
He'll tell you what's going on.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.856
-Ho ho ho!
-Stand right here, next to Santa.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.108
My little elf helper has arrived.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.986
Okay, don't be distracted
by all this Christmas crap.

07:25.069 --> 07:29.282
You're here for threat assessment.
Keep your eyes peeled for any danger.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.868
-Terry, can I talk to you for a second?
-Yep.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.537
Alright, Terry, I really need
tonight to go smoothly.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.832
No problems. I'm down in the polls,
I can't take the negative PR.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.668
Mayor Palmer,
don't you worry about it, okay?

07:40.751 --> 07:44.213
Nothing's going to go wrong.
Terry Seattle is on the case!

07:44.297 --> 07:45.923
-[lights click off]
-[all gasp]

07:46.132 --> 07:47.550
[suspenseful music playing]

07:48.801 --> 07:49.802
[bells jingling]

07:49.886 --> 07:51.345
-[man grunts, yells]
-[thud]

07:54.015 --> 07:55.057
[lights click on]

07:55.141 --> 07:56.851
Here we go.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.227
[all gasp]

08:01.898 --> 08:04.484
Oh, my God, Jason!
I leave you alone for two seconds,

08:04.567 --> 08:06.110
and Santa gets shivved?

08:06.194 --> 08:09.739
I didn't do it. Should we take it out?

08:09.822 --> 08:13.242
-Seems like he might still be alive.
-Oh, my God. Santa!

08:13.326 --> 08:19.123
-Santa, what happened?
-Someone stabbed me with a candy cane.

08:19.207 --> 08:23.169
That part is so apparent, Santa,
and sticking out of your chest.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.253
Who did it?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.506
[groaning] Butter.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.548
-Butter?
-Butter?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.549
[Santa groans]

08:31.052 --> 08:33.429
He said "butter" as his last words.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.557
What does that mean?
Does that mean anything to you?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.851
You look like you consume a lot of butter.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.853
I've been trying to cut down on that.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.398
-Oh God! Johnny.
-Johnny?

08:44.482 --> 08:47.818
-Johnny...
-Johnny, who-- Here, take off the beard.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.322
[Jason] Oh, Jesus.
You dragged Sean Hayes into this?

08:51.405 --> 08:55.368
Man. Legendary quarterback
John Blaze, Hall of Famer.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.746
Johnny was going to help
deliver presents to the orphans.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.165
Then throw a football
over the orphanage.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.169
Well, looks like
his life plans got intercepted.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.213
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.466
Is he still alive a little bit?
He might need mouth to mouth.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.553
-I'd love to.
-Let's see if that'll bring him back.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.845
-Johnny,
-Let's see--

09:14.929 --> 09:16.639
But now he's turning away from me.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.393
-Get in there.
-I've gotta plug and open. Plug and open.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.894
-Get him.
-Plug and open.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.187
Is he still holding?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.855
-And opening.
-[Palmer] Save him.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.108
He seems alive to me.
That seemed to do it.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.359
[babbles]

09:28.442 --> 09:29.694
Oh, he died again.

09:29.777 --> 09:34.198
[Terry] Well, we can't say we didn't try.
Okay, listen up, everybody.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
Legendary quarterback

09:36.742 --> 09:40.913
John "Johnny" Blaze was murdered.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.208
And his killer... is in this room.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.421
Mayor Palmer, we have to
shut this whole place down.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.464
Oh no, we can't lock down the building.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.259
We have to deliver those presents
by Christmas morning.

09:53.342 --> 09:56.929
-If we don't, it'll be a PR disaster.
-How long we got till sunrise?

09:57.013 --> 10:01.017
-Seven hours, 14 minutes.
-Wow, that was so specific.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.939
Okay, well, until then,
nobody can leave this building.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.150
-Okay?
-Fine.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.277
But you better find the killer by dawn,

10:11.360 --> 10:13.946
because if those presents
don't go to the kids,

10:14.030 --> 10:15.823
my political career is toast.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.410
And you better believe if I go down,
I'm taking you with me.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.872
I can't imagine I can go
further down than I already am.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.498
[screams]

10:24.582 --> 10:25.583
Oh, my God!

10:25.958 --> 10:28.961
Grab her chair.
Grab that chair. Let her sit down.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.172
Sit her right down.
Sit down, there she is.

10:31.255 --> 10:34.300
We're trapped! I can't do this!
We're all gonna die!

10:34.383 --> 10:37.011
She's having a panic attack.
You gotta calm her down.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.095
You gotta calm down.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.640
<i>-♪ Sweet little baby, don't you cry ♪</i>
-[shrieking]

10:40.723 --> 10:43.726
No, you are the worst at this.
Do something calmer.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.728
She can't -- Oh no, no, no.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.315
I just want to go home
and be with Mr. Whiskers.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.317
-Who's Mr. Whiskers?
-My kitty.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.696
-He always calms my fragile nerves.
-Well, you're an actor.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.991
-Be a kitty?
-Yeah. Mr. Whiskers can't be here

10:59.075 --> 11:02.078
-but we do have Master Bateman.
-Mr. Bateman.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.998
Just get on all fours like a cat.
Get on all fours and be a kitty.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.626
[Terry] There you go.
There you go.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.338
[Angie] He is kind of nice.
Come on, jump up.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.131
There we go, just lean across her.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.759
-There's a soft side of me.
-Clean. Clean.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.763
There we go.
Little kitty. What else--

11:20.846 --> 11:22.640
You want some milk, don't you?

11:22.723 --> 11:23.724
-Yes, please.
-Milk!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.351
Right down-- There we go.

11:25.434 --> 11:29.814
There he is, he'll get down
on all fours in the milk. Here we go.

11:29.897 --> 11:34.360
And then get right in there, okay.
And eyes up. Eyes up.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.822
-[Jason] Mmm, almond. [laughs]
-Eyes up. Lick it eyes up.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.115
There we go.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.034
-[exhales] I'm feeling better.
-Okay, good.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.494
-Thank you, detective.
-Good.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.788
-You're a saint.
-You got it.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.290
[Terry] Get up,
you're embarrassing yourself!

11:48.374 --> 11:49.917
What are you doing?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.796
God, that's humiliating.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.673
Payback's going to be tough.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.883
-Yeah.
-I got a long time to think about it.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.093
[sirens wailing]

11:59.260 --> 12:01.762
[officer] Lock it up.
No one comes in or out.

12:04.098 --> 12:07.435
All right, listen. You were there
when Santa got murdered.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.396
You remember anything?
You hear any unusual sound?

12:10.479 --> 12:13.941
I just remember a little bit of a squeal.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.067
-A squeal?
-Yep.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.403
That was all?
You didn't hear any other sound?

12:17.528 --> 12:20.448
-You didn't hear--
-I think I did hear...

12:20.531 --> 12:25.161
Yes, I did. There were three bells
and then the lights came on.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.790
-You heard three bells? I'm not crazy?
-Maybe it was five. It was... ching ching.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.918
Like a Christmas type of shaky thing.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.129
All right, let's examine the body,
shall we?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.255
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.756
[gasps] Gosh.
Amber at point.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.468
-You got here quick.
-I came as soon as I heard.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.886
Amber Kang, forensics.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.723
This is homicide trainee,
Jason Bateman, in an elf costume.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.683
Let's take a look.
Whaddya think, J?

12:47.766 --> 12:49.977
-Pop down here real quick.
-Yep.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.148
Amber, how was Santa killed
with just a candy cane?

12:54.231 --> 12:57.985
By it being sharpened
to a fine peppermint point.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.696
-You see how smooth that taper is?
-Yeah.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.490
You can't get that with a knife.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.159
You can only get that by licking it.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.369
It in order to lick that much...

13:08.120 --> 13:10.873
-must have loved mint.
-And licking.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.375
I guess, and licking, too.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.337
A Santa hater, but a great licker.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.506
Why don't you examine
the rest of the body?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.925
See if there's anything
you can find here.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.719
-Is there anything here?
-We've got-- hang on a second.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.181
-[Jason] We've got somebody's name tag.
-[Terry] Let me grab it.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.602
The name is smudged.

13:31.685 --> 13:36.273
It's possible that, that is the name tag
of the person Santa was struggling with.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.902
That he grabbed it off
of whoever killed him.

13:41.070 --> 13:46.367
Mayor, can you think of anybody here
who had a relationship with Johnny Blaze?

13:46.450 --> 13:47.952
Yeah, there is one.

13:48.035 --> 13:48.911
Jim Trentley.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.955
-Jim Trentley?!
-Absolutely.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.250
Sports reporter from Channel Five News?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.876
-Yeah.
-Do you know Jim?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.587
-I love his show.
-The two of them were really close.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.839
So Jim's in the bar,
he's pretty shaken up.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.966
Jim's in the bar.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.593
Sounds like we got
ourselves our first suspect.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.473
[clears throat]

14:11.183 --> 14:12.226
Mr. Trentley.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.813
[chuckles] Only my wife's divorce attorney
calls for Mr. Trentley.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.064
Call me Jim.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.774
[chuckles] Oh, well.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.859
Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.320
Big fan, and sorry about your divorce.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.363
Yeah, it's fine.

14:24.446 --> 14:28.450
Hey, I got myself a new little lady,
and she has got a pair

14:28.534 --> 14:31.245
of magic hands,
if you know what I'm talking about.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.663
[Terry] Okay.

14:32.746 --> 14:36.041
Jason's got some questions here
that he needs to ask you.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.293
Just routine stuff.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.962
That's funny, because,
I'm usually the one

14:40.045 --> 14:41.380
asking the questions.

14:41.463 --> 14:45.384
Hey, hey. What do you think
your team did, huh?

14:45.467 --> 14:48.262
-You think you'll make it into playoffs?
-[all laugh]

14:48.345 --> 14:50.514
Hey!
This is what we're going to do.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.892
Okay?
You're going to ask the question.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.561
You're an interviewer.
That's the microphone.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.397
You're going to be cameraman,
big man, cameraman.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.773
-Here he comes.
-Okay.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.442
That's your camera.

15:01.525 --> 15:05.946
We're going to do a classic, old school
locker room interview, all right?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.740
-I'm going to get ready.
-Okay.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.117
Boy, he's a character, huh?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.954
-[Jim] Don't drink my peppermint schnapps!
-Don't know how this is gonna go.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.957
-He seems... You got your--
-Go over a few questions.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.710
-You got some questions there?
-Should I run--

15:19.793 --> 15:21.921
-[Jim] Okay, I'm ready!
-I guess you could--

15:22.046 --> 15:23.255
Let's roll camera!

15:23.339 --> 15:24.506
Okay.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.301
-Oh, boy. Hey...
-Hey there.

15:27.384 --> 15:31.805
Folks, thanks for hanging out.
I was just hitting the showers.

15:31.889 --> 15:32.806
You know?

15:32.890 --> 15:34.600
Like a locker room interview.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.185
You got some questions for me?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.938
Can you describe your relationship
with Johnny Blaze?

15:39.021 --> 15:43.192
Johnny Blaze and I met 15 years ago,
became golfing buddies.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.529
-You played golf with Johnny Blaze?
-Yes, I did. Every Thursday.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.782
[chuckles] Johnny always won.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.993
I got a hell of a drive,
but my short game's for crap.

15:53.077 --> 15:57.373
You know, it's my putter!
That's why I lost all that money to him.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.501
You know, and whatever I owed him,
it would just go on my tab.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.878
How much money did you lose to Johnny?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.171
Well...

16:04.338 --> 16:07.132
[stammering] About $9 million.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.550
Wow.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.054
-You lost $9 million to Johnny Blaze?
-It was my damn putter.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.974
I could never get--
my short game's for crap.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.268
-Yeah, I don't know, golf's hard...
-Roger that.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.147
Was the money that you owed
a source of tension between you two?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.316
-$9 million, safe to bet it was.
-Tension.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.901
Come on, now.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.821
We would never let money
get in between us, boy.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.532
Even when he called in
the whole debt, recently.

16:31.615 --> 16:35.953
Um... he called in the debt?

16:36.036 --> 16:39.331
Oh yeah, of course he did.
Last week he called in the debt.

16:39.415 --> 16:43.585
Said he needed the cash for some
business ventures he was doing, you know?

16:43.669 --> 16:48.215
And, you know, when you think about it,
me not owing him $9 million

16:48.298 --> 16:52.845
is really the only positive thing
to come out of this whole sad event.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.223
What you're saying is you recognize that
you would have had...

16:56.306 --> 16:57.808
take some deep bends.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.351
Um, you...

16:59.435 --> 17:03.522
Him, now dead,
you would no longer need to...

17:04.064 --> 17:06.650
uh, pay him the $9 million.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.360
Uh...

17:08.444 --> 17:12.740
-Try downward dog, while we're at it.
-All right, well, if you say so.

17:12.823 --> 17:17.578
-He's a true ginger. I'll give him that.
-He's a true ginger. He's super flexible.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.955
He's very flexible
and not afraid to do it.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.375
[Terry] Well, thanks for your time, Jim.
I do have one request,

17:23.459 --> 17:24.585
and I feel bad asking.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.712
-You want an autograph?
-I would love one.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.757
-[laughs] That's alright, here you go.
-He's got his own.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.386
-I come with my own headshot.
-Cool. Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.765
-T-E-R-R-Y.
-To my new best friend, Toby Skedaddle.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.433
-Here you go.
-Close enough.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.769
But you know what I want?
Now come on.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.729
Oh, yeah. Oh, God!

17:45.606 --> 17:47.191
You're a good hugger.

17:47.858 --> 17:52.071
[Terry] <i>After a rocky start, Jason and I</i>
<i>were finally clicking as partners.</i>

17:52.154 --> 17:56.950
<i>We were ready to track down more suspects.</i>
<i>But fate, and Mayor Palmer,</i>

17:57.034 --> 17:58.118

17:58.202 --> 17:59.411
Where have you two been?

17:59.495 --> 18:02.456
-[Jason] Well...
-[Terry] Uh... Sorry, it took a second

18:02.539 --> 18:06.293
just to convince Jim
to put his clothes back on, it got dicey.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.213
We're here at your service,
we're really on top of this.

18:09.296 --> 18:13.008
Are you? It seems clear to me you're
not able to handle this on your own.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.385
-Well...
-We're doing our best.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.929
-We are...
-I don't think so.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.598
-And that's why I've called in backup.
-[Terry] What?

18:19.681 --> 18:23.268
No, no, no. Come on, Mayor.
Last thing I need is another idiot

18:23.352 --> 18:25.938
-that I got to babysit up in here.
-Boy.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.397
-Okay?
-I'm excited.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.191
-Well.
-Come on out, Maya.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.527
This is such a mistake.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.820
Here you go.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.738
-Stand right here, please.
-Okay. Hi.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.908
Detective, Jason. This is Maya Rudolph.
She's on your team now.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.160
-Incredible to meet you.
-Great to meet you.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.663
-Hi.
-Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.872
-Maya Rudolph.
-Maya.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.749
-It's great we got help.
-Just great.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.753
I need all of you to find the killer
and close this case.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.505
-You understand?
-Yeah, got it.

18:51.588 --> 18:57.386
Great. Now, Terry, you have five hours
before the sun rises and your career sets.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.721
Wow.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.808
-Thought it'd be another--
-Super menacing.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.769
-Five hours? A lot of time.
-So you work together.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.729
Now we're all working together?

19:07.813 --> 19:11.066
-What does your gut tell you so far?
-Nothing, I just got here.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
-Santa Claus is dead.
-I'll tell you what.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.278
[snickering]

19:14.361 --> 19:16.864
Jason, why don't you
tell Maya what's happened?

19:16.947 --> 19:19.700
-Really, Santa Claus is dead?
-Tell her what's happened.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.910
Only got about 20 seconds.
Here we go.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.662
-Johnny Blaze...
-Yeah.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.455
-...was a football player.
-Okay.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.791
He's now dead. He was playing Santa.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.710
-Okay.
-So, Santa

19:29.793 --> 19:33.463
-was killed by a sharp candy cane...
-Object? Okay.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.550
...that was made
into a point through licking.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.095
-That was made sharp from licking?
-Lick made the point.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.975
Lick made the point, Santa's dead,
Johnny Blaze is not dead, though.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.644
-Johnny Blaze is dead.
-[Terry] Johnny Blaze is dead.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.814
Johnny Blaze is dead.
And there was a naked sports caster.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.025
He's a ginger, too.
He seemed pretty guilty.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.277
-The naked guy?
-Yeah! And drunk,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.864
-and he owed Johnny Blaze $9 million.
-[gasps]

19:58.947 --> 20:01.450
-We don't know who killed Santa?
-Why we're here.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.410
-We're gonna figure it out.
-Obviously.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.247
Okay. I feel I'm up to speed.
I don't know where we are.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.166
Where are we now?
Tell her that.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.168
We're in an office building.

20:11.251 --> 20:16.840
-No, where does the mayor work?
-The mayor works at big city, right?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.967
In any city, where does the mayor--

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
-City Hall.
-There we go.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.513
I gotta tell you something,
this is a disaster.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.473
-No.
-Why?

20:24.556 --> 20:26.350
Hello? I'm calling for Johnny Blaze.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.977
I need to cancel his massage
appointment tomorrow.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.979
No, he's not rescheduling.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.775
Did you just hear that?
She works for Johnny Blaze.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.319
We need to go
and see what she knows.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.363
About Johnny. Yep, let's do it.

20:39.446 --> 20:43.116
Obviously about Johnny,
not what she knows about other stuff.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.369
And we don't know who killed him?

20:45.452 --> 20:47.955
We got to find out
because otherwise the orphans

20:48.038 --> 20:50.040
aren't going to get their toys,
and then

20:50.123 --> 20:53.252
the other thing that'll
get murdered is the spirit of Christmas.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.587
[cackling]

20:56.713 --> 20:59.424
It's true. All these gifts
are for the orphans.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.260
"Get murdered."

21:02.344 --> 21:05.389
Okay. Okay, cool.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.724
[Terry] <i>We put suspect number two</i>
<i>in an office</i>

21:07.808 --> 21:10.310
<i>to sweat for a bit</i>
<i>before interrogating her.</i>

21:10.394 --> 21:13.814
<i>But getting her to talk</i>
<i>would be our toughest mission yet.</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:17.776
Oh, my God. Can somebody please tell me
why I'm being held in here?

21:17.859 --> 21:20.654
First, let's just get
the intros out of the way.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.948
I am Senior Detective Terry Seattle.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.535
We're going to start right at
the beginning here. What is your name?

21:26.618 --> 21:29.246
I'm Mia Briggs,
and I was Johnny's personal assistant.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.291
-How come you're wearing his name tag?
-I was gonna ask.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.959
This is actually mine.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.670
Johnny said remembering
the name Mia was impossible,

21:36.753 --> 21:39.715
-so he called me Johnny.
-We're gonna ask you about Johnny.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.717
-I can't answer anything.
-Why not?

21:41.800 --> 21:45.387
I signed an ironclad NDA.
Can't answer anything to do with him.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.807
-Ironclad NDA? Not a regular NDA?
-It was very intense.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.518
We don't have time
to get to the bottom of this.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.647
We're going to do something
I call good cop, bad cop, Terry style.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.233
Jason, you're a good cop.
Maya, you're a bad cop.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.111
If things don't work out,
switch roles. So look for cues.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.322
-You're good.
-You're good, you're bad.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.033
You're going to be answering
some questions right now!

22:06.116 --> 22:07.743
-Hey, Mia.
-Right here.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.661
[Mia] I'm gonna sit, but not talk.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.079
Okay, let's see about that.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.332
-Get over here.
-Let's see about that.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.793
-Right here. Good cop, bad, go!
-You look awesome today,

22:16.877 --> 22:19.588
That color's very pretty
on your complexion.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.507
When's the last time you saw
your boss alive?

22:22.591 --> 22:23.759
This morning.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.303
-Yeah, you murder him?
-I can't talk about him.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.722
I don't even know why
I answered those.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.432
Defensive much?

22:30.515 --> 22:33.143
-You don't want to get her upset?
-Switch it.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.936
You're gonna answer the question

22:35.020 --> 22:38.106
or you're going to get
carted out of here on a stretcher.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.193
-I'm not answering.
-Sweetie, I just have a couple questions.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.112
-I love your sweater.
-We need something helpful from you.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.781
I can't talk about him.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.325
We got to try new kinds of cops.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.703
Maya, French cop,
Jason, Italian cop.

22:52.954 --> 22:57.834
Mia... [speaks French]

22:57.918 --> 22:59.711
[speaking broken Italian]

22:59.795 --> 23:04.382
[Maya continues speaking French]

23:04.466 --> 23:05.467
Smoke.

23:05.550 --> 23:10.430
[Maya continues speaking broken French]

23:10.514 --> 23:12.182
Forget about it.

23:12.265 --> 23:16.311
[Italian accent] Forget about it!
What you think you know?

23:16.394 --> 23:18.855
And tell me what I need to know.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.150
[French accent] You know what I think?
You Americans put too much

23:22.234 --> 23:23.819
ketchup on your hamburgers.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.863
At the Olive Garden,
when you're here, your family.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.783
When you're here...

23:29.866 --> 23:31.118
Singing cop.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.288
<i>♪ Let me ask you a couple of questions ♪</i>

23:36.706 --> 23:38.917

23:39.000 --> 23:40.252

23:40.335 --> 23:43.588
-[imitates Liam] I will protect you.
-Pretty good!

23:43.672 --> 23:46.508
-Pretty good.
-Okay, Maya, working class British cop.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.719
[British accent] I'm gonna give you
five fucking minutes, right?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.973
And then you're going to fucking tell me.
What the fuck.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.516
[laughs]

23:54.599 --> 23:57.018
Only speaks in robot sound-bleeps.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.771
[imitates robot] Okay. We need...

23:59.855 --> 24:03.984
-some answers out of you.
-No words, just bleeps.

24:04.067 --> 24:08.321
[makes robot noises]

24:08.405 --> 24:11.074
Listen, you don't want to get
the robot mad.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.660
-He'll fucking punch you, right?
-[robot noise]

24:13.743 --> 24:15.328
-Rick Astley cop.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.629
-[shouts] Is that enough for you?
-I'll talk!

24:24.713 --> 24:25.964
[normal] There it is.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.592
-We did it.
-You're running point on this.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.594
Ask about her job
working for Johnny.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.596
-[normal] Yes, I have questions.
-Yeah.

24:32.679 --> 24:36.141
Okay. What were your responsibilities?

24:36.224 --> 24:38.810
I had his calendar.
I would drive him places.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.104
-Okay.
-I faked an ADHD condition

24:41.188 --> 24:43.773
-so that he could snort my Adderall.
-Wait, what?

24:43.857 --> 24:47.277
One time, he had me drive through
a tornado to get to Sam's Club

24:47.360 --> 24:50.238
because he said, quote,
"I need all of the butter."

24:51.114 --> 24:53.074
-[beeping]
-Wait, hang on. Sorry.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.243
I have to do this really quick.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.706
-What's that?
-Okay, so Johnny said that

24:59.789 --> 25:02.542
my breath smelled like
a wet sneaker with gonorrhea.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.670
So he asked me to spray my mouth
with mint every five minutes.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.090
So he said unkind things
to you often and you like mint?

25:09.174 --> 25:12.427
It seems to me--
I'm just going to put this out there...

25:12.510 --> 25:14.638
-Johnny's a little controlling.
-Okay, wait.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.432
I feel like you're getting
the wrong impression of him.

25:17.515 --> 25:20.227
He really was
a very great boss most of the time.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.687
-Doesn't sound like it.
-No, he got me a present.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.981
-Really?
-Yes. Look. This beautiful necklace.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.150
-[bells jingling]
-He got me this necklace

25:27.234 --> 25:29.444
that makes noise
so he can know where I am.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.613
Now I know where he is all times.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.740
-Where is he?
-Boss heaven.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.367
"Boss heaven?"

25:36.451 --> 25:38.286
Terry, you need to see this.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.665
Who the fuck is that?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.044
Take a look at this.

25:46.127 --> 25:50.257
All the guests were close enough to Johnny
to stab him when the lights went out,

25:50.340 --> 25:54.010
but the circuit breaker
for the power is all the way over here.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.430
There wasn't time for any guests
to cut the lights and stab Johnny.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.932
Know what that means?

25:59.015 --> 26:01.518
Can I just have a moment with my trainees?

26:01.601 --> 26:04.604
Whoever turned off the lights
can't be the same person...

26:04.688 --> 26:06.398
[both] ...who killed Johnny. Jinx!

26:06.481 --> 26:08.400
-Oh, my God.
-[both laugh]

26:08.483 --> 26:11.236
-What if it's Stretch Armstrong?
-The character?

26:11.319 --> 26:15.323
The one with the arms that could reach
that and stab at the same time.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.658
You know what this means?

26:16.741 --> 26:21.371
This means there's an accomplice.
This changes everything.

26:21.454 --> 26:25.333
-[deep voice] So what you're saying is...
-[both] There's an accomplice.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.586
And this accomplice is out here,
hiding in plain sight,

26:28.670 --> 26:32.841
and their only goal is to try to stop us.
We are no longer the hunters.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.218
We are now the hunted.

26:35.302 --> 26:39.097
And there's a new hunter
who's out there hunting us.

26:39.180 --> 26:43.852
The former hunters,
being now the hunted...

26:43.935 --> 26:45.729
by the new hunter.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.315
-Are you having a stroke?
-[woman] Hello?

26:49.733 --> 26:51.901
-Who's that?
-Oh, shit. The orphans.

26:51.985 --> 26:55.071
-What are they doing here?
-They've been waiting to meet Santa.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.781
I forgot about them in the chaos.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.326
If they see Santa dead,
my career is over.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.618
Okay, what do we do?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.412
-Think.
-"Hard Knock Life."

27:02.495 --> 27:04.581
Sweeping. Should I give 'em a broom?

27:04.664 --> 27:06.958
Wait a second! I got an idea.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.588
You stall 'em, Mayor.
You two, come with me.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.381
Please.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.594
Hi, hi. So sorry. Sorry for the delay.
Hi. Are you kids having fun?

27:17.677 --> 27:20.472
We've been sitting
in your office for five hours.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.890
-Yeah.
-What's going on?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.684
We got him all set here.
Let's just get him--

27:24.768 --> 27:26.019
[laughter]

27:26.102 --> 27:30.565
All right. Okay. All right, guys,
we got Santa. Come on.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.025
-No.
-Come on back here.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.569
So Santa is having, like, a moment.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.489
Hold that. You manage that,
and, Jason, you get there.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.492
And Santa's gonna have
that moment for a while.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.743
[Terry] Santa's ready.

27:41.826 --> 27:46.081
Okay. Well, then,
come this way, I guess.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.084
Wow.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.128
-[Jason as Santa] Hello.
-This is great. Come here.

27:52.212 --> 27:57.050
Hello, boys and girls. Would you like
a present? What would you like?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.344
Why isn't Santa's mouth moving?

27:59.427 --> 28:01.679
Move his mouth, Maya.
You keep doing his arms.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.349
[Jason as Santa] It's moving.
There. Can't you see?

28:04.432 --> 28:06.935
Some of the kids want to sit
on Santa's lap.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.771
-Please sit here.
-Yep. You wanna-- Go ahead.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.191
-Right here.
-What happened to your beard?

28:13.274 --> 28:17.862
I've got no hair on my bottom of my face.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.074
Be sensitive.
It's called alopecia.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.369
Why is there red stuff on your suit?

28:24.452 --> 28:29.082
That's a leaky gut. Please tell me
what you want for Christmas.

28:29.165 --> 28:34.003
I'd like a new doll, and an art kit,
and a soccer ball.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.548
She doesn't get to ask for three things.

28:36.631 --> 28:40.135
-No, only one.
-You don't get to ask for so many things.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.512
You take what you get
and you don't get upset.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.140
[sobs]

28:45.223 --> 28:46.766
Santa's so mean.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.309
Come here, come here.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.895
-Mayor, what is going on?
-You're a crybaby.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.772
Santa, can you behave yourself?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.191
-You're terrible at this. Switch.
-Apologies.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.068
-Please hold.
-Okay.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.822
-Say, "Sorry about that."
-[laughs]

29:00.905 --> 29:03.450
-Say, "Sorry about that."
-[Maya as Santa] So sorry.

29:03.533 --> 29:07.704
Hey, kids, do you like TikTok?
I'm Gwen Stefani.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.498
[vocalizing]

29:10.915 --> 29:12.584
I'm dabbing! I mean, I'm dabbing.

29:12.667 --> 29:17.839
-Oh he's dabbing, Santa's dabbing.
-Look at me. Yay! TikTok is cool.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.841
Ticky, tock.
Ticky, tick tick tick.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.176
Ticky tok, tickey tok.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.219
Who wants to sit on Santa's lap?

29:23.928 --> 29:26.806
-Okay. What's your name?
-My name's Terence.

29:26.890 --> 29:30.143
-Terrence. I like that.
-What do you want for Christmas, Terrence?

29:30.226 --> 29:32.353
What do you want for Christmas, Terrence?

29:32.437 --> 29:35.440
I don't think you can give me
what I want, Santa.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.484
Oh yeah? Try me, bitch.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.403
What I want more than anything
in the world...

29:40.487 --> 29:42.822
-Yeah?
-...is a mommy and daddy.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.284
A real mommy and daddy.
A forever mommy and daddy.

29:47.368 --> 29:53.249
I thought maybe you can wish for it
along with me, it'll come true.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.376
[crying]
Wish for them. Wish for it, Maya.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.670
I'm wishing, I'm wishing.

29:57.754 --> 30:02.467
Come here. Come closer.
Put your-- Nuzzle your head in my chest.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.428
You're a good baby.
You're a good baby.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.348
I love you. How about some chocolate?

30:08.431 --> 30:10.183
-Do you like chocolate?
-Yeah!

30:10.266 --> 30:11.851
Okay, here, here you go.

30:11.935 --> 30:15.939
Okay... you know what?
Great, get your chocolate.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.857
And I think that's good.

30:17.941 --> 30:21.027
-Okay, we did it, everybody let's go.
-Eat it up.

30:21.110 --> 30:24.656
Bye, I love you guys.
My gosh, I love you guys so much.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.115
-Bye.
-Thank you.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.408
I love you.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.536
-[normal] My finger.
-I think we're clear.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.287
-My finger hurts.
-We're clear.

30:32.205 --> 30:36.709
We did it. We pulled it off. I didn't
think we were going to be able to do it.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.837
I think they really bought it.
We did it!

30:38.920 --> 30:41.756
I think I finally figured out
what Christmas is all about.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.841
What is it, Terry?

30:42.966 --> 30:46.636
It's not about parties and noise
canceling headphones. It's about hope.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.138
-And we got to give those kids hope.
-Yes.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.183
We're gonna catch this killer
and save Christmas, right?

30:52.267 --> 30:54.769
-[all scream]
-Jesus Christ.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.855
What did you do to Santa?

30:56.938 --> 31:00.024
Would somebody
please help out Angie again?

31:00.900 --> 31:03.403
-My gosh.
-She really scared me.

31:03.486 --> 31:06.072
She's just-- this has been
a whole thing with Angie.

31:06.155 --> 31:09.242
-It all started with a big scream.
-He had to be a cat for--

31:09.325 --> 31:10.451
-Amber, yes.
-Terry.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.121
I cross referenced
the party's guest list with Johnny

31:13.204 --> 31:15.665
-looking for connections and I got a hit.
-Okay.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.959
Donna Foccacia.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.961
-Like the bread?
-Exactly.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.921
-Really?
-She's the brains and money

31:22.005 --> 31:24.257
behind tons of
athlete branded restaurants.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.134
So she's going to help us how?

31:26.217 --> 31:28.511
Her and Johnny were
collaborating on a project.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.305
You'll find her in the VIP lounge.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.973
-The VIP lounge?
-Yes.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.434
We have an exclusive club,
two floors up.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.519
-Here?
-City Hall's got a VIP lounge?

31:36.644 --> 31:38.897
Less than two hours
before the orphans wake up

31:38.980 --> 31:40.857
looking for their presents.
Move fast,

31:40.940 --> 31:44.527
and keep your cell phone on.
I want to be in constant contact.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.279
Do you know what this means?

31:46.362 --> 31:50.116
The killer's accomplice is still out there
and we got targets on our back.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.159
Like we're hunted?

31:51.242 --> 31:53.745
Yeah.
If we're going to solve this,

31:54.120 --> 32:00.084
the only way it's going to happen
is that if you two go deep undercover.

32:00.168 --> 32:04.756
[Terry] <i>We headed to the VIP lounge</i>
<i>with Maya posing as an elite athlete,</i>

32:04.839 --> 32:06.799
<i>and Jason as her manager.</i>

32:06.883 --> 32:09.260
<i>We kept an eye out for the accomplice,</i>

32:09.344 --> 32:14.265
<i>but it turned out</i>
<i>their eye was already on us.</i>

32:14.349 --> 32:18.269
[ominous music]

32:25.902 --> 32:29.280
Okay, this is the VIP area.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.075
I don't understand
why they have a VIP room.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.827
-You two are going in there alone.
-[both] What?

32:34.911 --> 32:37.956
Don't worry.
I'll be with you the entire time.

32:38.039 --> 32:42.001
-Yeah. You gonna pop these in your ears.
-Are these drugs?

32:42.168 --> 32:45.588
No, these are just ear pieces,
put one in each of your ear.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.966
You're gonna pitch
Donna a restaurant idea

32:48.049 --> 32:50.551
and try to get her talking
about Johnny Blaze.

32:50.635 --> 32:55.098
And I'm going to find a safe place
to hide, and I'll talk you through it.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.474
-You got it?
-Okay.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.309
Get in there.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.410

-Motherfucker!

33:39.183 --> 33:43.271
[Donna] I said, you can slap a horse's ass
but don't expect it to kiss you.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.732
[Terry on radio]
<i>Jason and Maya, can you hear me?</i>

33:45.815 --> 33:46.816
[both] Yes.

33:46.899 --> 33:50.361
<i>Let's get to work.</i>
<i>Did you find Donna?</i>

33:50.445 --> 33:53.656
-Did you find Donna?
-No. Don't repeat that. Did you find her?

33:53.740 --> 33:57.452
-You talking about the bread lady?
<i>-Yes, that's her. Do what I tell you to.</i>

33:57.535 --> 33:59.996
-<i>Wait till she's alone. Is she alone?</i>
-[both] Yes.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.247
Go sit next to her.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.836
-Hi, there.
-Hi. Hello.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.337

Feed her, give her.

-I'd like you to meet my client...

-Her name's Martina.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.508
-I'm Bulgarian.
<i>-"From Bulgaria."</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:54.759
From Bulgaria.

-I'm like Mrs. Bulgaria.

-And what is it that you do?
<i>-"I am basketball sporter."</i>

35:02.183 --> 35:05.853

"Thing is, Martina's got
this restaurant idea..."

35:22.245 --> 35:25.039
The thing is, Martina's
got this restaurant idea, eh,

35:25.123 --> 35:27.667
and it's a real beaut-- Or a real getter.

35:27.750 --> 35:31.754
Hey, barkeep, this a mint julep?
I said rum and Mountain Dew.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.842
[Donna] Get this shit out of my face.
God damn, I hate me a mint julep.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.179
All right, so what now? You got some
big idea you want to pitch me?

35:40.263 --> 35:44.600
"I want to open world's first
authentic Bulgarian pizzeria."

35:44.684 --> 35:48.980
I want to open world's first
authentic Bulgarian pizzeria.

35:49.063 --> 35:52.817
You want to serve,
like, a Bulgarian-style pizza?

35:52.900 --> 35:56.737

-This is authentic Bulgarian, okay?

35:56.821 --> 36:00.241

-Everything Bulgarian.
<i>-"Except the pizza."</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:09.584
-Except the pizza.
<i>-"Pizza would be like Domino's."</i>

36:09.667 --> 36:13.379
-The pizza would be like Domino's.
-Just roll that back for me.

36:13.462 --> 36:16.299
Well, the experience would be like,
uh Bulgarian, eh.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.718
And the ingredients.
We're gonna have--

36:18.801 --> 36:21.053
[Terry] <i>"That's wrong.</i>
<i>It'd be like Domino's."</i>

36:21.137 --> 36:23.806
No, that's wrong.
It'd be more like a Domino's.

-"He's so stupid and wrong."
-He's so stupid and wrong.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.608
"You ever experienced
a Bulgarian bathroom?"

36:33.691 --> 36:35.735
You ever experienced
a Bulgarian bathroom?

36:35.818 --> 36:37.987
"I dropped a huge
coiler in there once, eh."

36:38.070 --> 36:41.115
-I dropped a coiler in there once, eh.
<i>-"Huge coiler."</i>

36:41.199 --> 36:42.158
Huge coiler!

36:42.241 --> 36:44.202
Huge, like a Thanksgiving coiler.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.286
-Okay.
-You know?

36:45.369 --> 36:47.788
<i>-"But the pizza's great."</i>
-But the pizza's great.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.957
I'm running the numbers here.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.170
-So, it's actually Domino's Pizza?
-Yeah, it would be like Domino's.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.505
-Now you're getting it, eh.
<i>-"What you think?"</i>

36:56.714 --> 36:59.425
-What you think?
-I got to shoot you straight.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.053
This is the worst idea

37:02.136 --> 37:06.265
I ever been pitched
in my whole life.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.352
<i>-Tell her how crazy she is.</i>
-You're crazy!

37:09.435 --> 37:11.312
Oh, you're crazy!

37:11.395 --> 37:13.814
-Let me tell you something.
-You're crazy.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.359
-You're close.
-You're crazy in the face.

37:16.442 --> 37:18.027
<i>-Keep going.</i>
-You're crazy.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.530
You make a moose look like a genius.
You allergic to money?

37:22.156 --> 37:25.701
You both are dumber
than a can of wet salad.

37:25.785 --> 37:30.248
-You're almost as dumb as Johnny Blaze.
-[gasps]

37:30.331 --> 37:33.918
-"You got a beef with Johnny Blaze?"
-You got a beef with Johnny Blaze?

37:34.001 --> 37:35.878
I got more than a beef with Johnny.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.546
Can you tell me more about that?

37:37.630 --> 37:41.801
Johnny comes to me, he says,
"I want to open up a new barbecue joint."

37:41.884 --> 37:46.764
So I bring Johnny right under my wing.
I teach him everything that I know.

37:46.847 --> 37:50.059
The dumb entrée names,
the disgustingly large portions,

37:50.142 --> 37:53.479
the obscene amounts
of butter on everything, okay?

37:53.562 --> 37:55.606
<i>-So what did Johnny do?</i>
-So what'd he do?

37:55.690 --> 38:00.194
He backs out of the deal last minute,
so he can open up his own place

38:00.278 --> 38:03.281
to compete with my flagship restaurant
in Times Square.

38:03.364 --> 38:08.494
-What's happening with the restaurant now?
-Nothing with Johnny's, because he's dead.

-Johnny--
-It's her!

40:33.264 --> 40:35.933
-No it's her. She sucked a candy cane--
-What do you--

40:36.016 --> 40:37.476
Because she likes mint.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.062
What about the bread lady?
And the butter?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.356
-I don't know about bread.
-There was butter.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.901
There was empty butter pats
on the table in front of the gal

40:45.985 --> 40:48.362
-we were pitching to.
-Wait, there were?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.406
Yeah. I pay attention.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.784
You're out of time, so we gotta decide.
We're gonna head over here.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.828
On your way,
each of you grab a present.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.787
-Okay?
-Okay.

40:56.871 --> 41:00.207
-Come on, Terry, you got 15 minutes.
-Okay. All right.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.129
I know this isn't how you wanted to spend
your evening, locked up.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.048
It was the only way to
solve the murder of Johnny Blaze.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.009
Time to find out if

41:10.092 --> 41:14.346
Jason, Maya, and Pete,
know who is responsible.

41:15.181 --> 41:18.476
Was it Jim Trentley?

41:18.559 --> 41:22.396
Mia Briggs?
Or Donna Foccacia?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.648
-[laughs]
-Hey, man.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.611
She's had to live with that
her whole life.

41:28.694 --> 41:29.862
Dick's like you.

41:29.945 --> 41:33.616
-Fuckin' asshole.
-So, each one of you is holding a present.

41:33.699 --> 41:34.825
-Please.
-Yeah.

41:34.909 --> 41:38.913
You're going to hand it to the person
you think murdered Johnny Blaze.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.332
Maya, you're going to go first.

41:41.415 --> 41:45.085
[tense music playing]

41:49.173 --> 41:50.841
[Jason] Really think about it.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.928
-Here you go.
-[all gasp]

41:54.011 --> 41:56.347
What?

41:56.430 --> 42:00.684
-How dare you? I'm so insulted.
-I'm just doing my job.

42:00.768 --> 42:04.188
-She's making an informed guess.
-Naming the Mayor as the killer?

42:05.022 --> 42:07.399
I think that, that shows real gumption.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.110
I don't know if she did it yet.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.530
We're going to find out.
Jason, it's up to you.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.242
-Who do you think murdered Johnny Blaze?
-I got it, thank you.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.833
-Jesus.
-Suicide.

42:24.917 --> 42:28.796
-Wow.
-[Palmer] This is unorthodox.

42:29.588 --> 42:33.425
-Okay. I've seen his work.
-Nothing indicated suicide.

42:33.509 --> 42:38.264
Sure it does. The guy was a quarterback,
and then he became Santa at City Hall.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.433
-How did he stab himself with the...
-He licked himself lousy

42:41.517 --> 42:45.312
-then stuck it in his gut.
-Licked it, then he sticked it.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.022
-Okay?
-You guys are good.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.524
We're teeing up Pete here.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.485
-We're fond of him. Here he goes.
-[Terry] All right, Pete.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.780
Based on this entire case
that you've had the luxury of studying,

42:54.863 --> 42:57.700
who do you think killed Johnny Blaze?

42:57.783 --> 42:59.243
Who's the spearmint lady?

42:59.326 --> 43:01.203
-Pink pants.
-Okay, it's her,

43:04.623 --> 43:06.250
But I'm gonna be a dick.

43:07.459 --> 43:10.087
-[Terry gasps]
-[Maya laughs]

43:10.713 --> 43:11.839
[groans]

43:11.922 --> 43:13.591
I think you're up to something.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.342
-So, just to recap...
-Yep.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.219
Maya, you think the Mayor did it?

43:17.886 --> 43:19.221
The fuck?

43:19.722 --> 43:22.141
Jason, you think
that he committed suicide?

43:22.224 --> 43:23.100
I would.

43:23.183 --> 43:24.602
[Maya laughs]

43:25.311 --> 43:27.730
-And Pete, you think I did it?
-Yeah.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.235
So we had three suspects,
and you chose none of them.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.361
Yes.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.281
-Fantastic.
-Now what?

43:37.364 --> 43:40.075
Listen here, there is a mountain
of evidence out there.

43:40.159 --> 43:45.039
So whoever did commit this murder, please,
now is your chance to come clean.

43:45.122 --> 43:50.252
You may think that all you've done is
killed legendary quarterback Johnny Blaze.

43:50.836 --> 43:54.965
But what you've really done is you've
committed the most heinous act of all.

43:55.049 --> 43:59.678
If we don't get those presents to those
orphans in the next 12 minutes

44:00.512 --> 44:04.308
those kids are going to stop
believing in Santa

44:04.391 --> 44:09.021
and you will have
murdered the spirit of Christmas.

44:10.731 --> 44:11.690
Who did it?

44:16.028 --> 44:18.489
-I can't take it anymore.
-[all gasp]

44:18.572 --> 44:20.240
It was me, I did it!

44:20.324 --> 44:22.785
-Why?
-How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

44:22.868 --> 44:24.161
I've never met you before.

44:24.244 --> 44:27.873
Legendary Channel Five
sports anchor Jim Trentley!

44:27.956 --> 44:31.251
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
I didn't have the money,

44:31.335 --> 44:35.297
he was going to tell everybody
about my debt, ruin my TV career.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.175
Yes, of course.
Of course. It had to be you.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.512
<i>Jason heard the sound</i>
<i>of jingle bells during the murder.</i>

44:41.595 --> 44:44.390
Jim was the one who had that
ugly bell sweater.

44:44.473 --> 44:46.308
-Hey...
-Sorry.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.310
Jim was drinking peppermint schnapps.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.979
<i>We know the killer</i>
<i>liked the taste of mint.</i>

44:51.063 --> 44:54.817
Donna sent back her mint julep.
She hated it when you were at the bar.

44:54.900 --> 44:58.153
This a mint julep? I said rum and
Mountain Dew, get this shit out.

44:58.237 --> 45:02.241
Finally there's the name tag issue.
Everybody's name tag was smudged.

45:02.324 --> 45:06.078
<i>We found the smudged name tag</i>
<i>in the hand of Johnny Blaze.</i>

45:06.161 --> 45:08.914
<i>Which means the killer</i>
<i>must've made a second name tag.</i>

45:08.997 --> 45:14.628
Only one person didn't have a smudged
name tag and that was Jim Trentley.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.171
Call me Jim.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.924
And his was signed
with a brand new red Sharpie

45:19.007 --> 45:22.511
that matched the headshot
that you signed for me.

45:22.594 --> 45:23.637
Wow.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.890
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

45:26.974 --> 45:30.936
You're not only going to jail,
you're also going to hell.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.646
Do they have golf in jail?

45:32.729 --> 45:34.273
Golf! Of course!

45:34.356 --> 45:38.235
That adds up. We thought
Johnny Blaze's last words were "butter."

45:38.318 --> 45:41.905
-Butter.
-But it wasn't "butter." It was "putter."

45:43.031 --> 45:45.409
-Oh.
-Oh, my gosh.

45:45.492 --> 45:47.744
-That's a twist.
-This guy's crying.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.913
It's so fucking sad.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.541
He was trying to tell us who
the killer was.

45:52.624 --> 45:54.084
But there was an accomplice.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.170
-Who turned off the lights?
-Thank you.

45:56.253 --> 45:59.923
The accomplice
was Jim Trentley's new girl, Angie!

46:00.382 --> 46:01.425
What?

46:01.508 --> 46:03.927
<i>Jim told us his new</i>
<i>lady friend had magic hands.</i>

46:04.011 --> 46:07.806
<i>Guess who was wrapping the orphan's</i>
<i>presents at lightning speed?</i>

46:07.890 --> 46:09.975
<i>She was the one</i>
<i>hunting us in the hallway.</i>

46:10.058 --> 46:12.269
<i>She wasn't out of breath</i>
<i>from a panic attack,</i>

46:12.352 --> 46:17.566
<i>but from running the hallways</i>
<i>in a ski mask, trying to take us out.</i>

46:18.108 --> 46:22.654
Jim, you idiot! I told you
to not talk about my magic hands.

46:22.738 --> 46:27.576
-I love you, Boo Boo.
-Hey, Jim, why don't you go fuck yourself?

46:27.659 --> 46:29.953
Officers, take him away.

46:30.579 --> 46:34.082
But nobody even gave me a present.
If nobody got it...

46:34.166 --> 46:36.502
Can't I-- That's rude.

46:37.836 --> 46:41.632
-Well, thanks for having me.
-That was crazy. Thank God it's all over.

46:41.715 --> 46:42.883
Detective!

46:42.966 --> 46:46.094
-Uh-oh.
-You wanted a present from the table?

46:46.178 --> 46:51.058
Well, my magic hands
wrapped something nice and big for you,

46:51.141 --> 46:54.186
and it's going to blow you away!

46:55.687 --> 46:58.982
-Oh, no.
-[beeping]

46:59.066 --> 47:00.067
Careful.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.028
[all gasp]

47:03.111 --> 47:04.571
A real bomb!

47:05.739 --> 47:08.534
-Look, we need to evacuate.
-No time for that.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.827
This entire building is going to blow.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.039
-Fifty-five seconds, MacGruber!
-Let me see it.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.668
Oh my God! There are three wires,
red, green, and blue.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.169
-Right.
-No!

47:20.003 --> 47:21.880
-You're lucky.
-[Jason] Good instincts.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.340
We're not prepared for that.

47:23.423 --> 47:25.759
Cut the correct wire,
the bomb will disarm.

47:25.842 --> 47:28.345
If you cut the wrong one, we all die.

47:28.428 --> 47:32.349
You seem comfortable with explosives.
You have to run point on this.

47:32.432 --> 47:34.268
Cut the right one, you decide.

47:34.351 --> 47:37.229
Consensus.
Talk together about what to do.

47:37.312 --> 47:39.565
[Jason] I think maybe red,
the pliers are red.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.526
I think blue because
it's the only non Christmas color.

47:42.609 --> 47:44.444
We're running out of time here.

47:44.528 --> 47:47.573
I'm thinking we just go like,
three, two, one, go?

47:47.656 --> 47:49.700
Or do we go one, two, three?

47:49.783 --> 47:52.786
-Do we do it on three?
-We don't have time for this!

47:52.869 --> 47:53.870
Here we go!

-[Maya] Good job.

I'm never gonna forget. I know.

for coming down here.

Thanks so much, Terry.

48:39.333 --> 48:40.667
What's wrong, Mayor?

Well, the day may be saved,
but not the spirit of Christmas.

-God dang it, the orphans.
-We only have six minutes to sunrise.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.428

wake up with no presents at all.

You saved Christmas.

-I didn't get one.

I guess Santa felt
I didn't deserve one.
