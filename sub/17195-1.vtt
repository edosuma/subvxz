Sorry, sir, I didn't know.
I wasn't here when you arrived.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.480
That's all right.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.120
DC Lloyd Ellis, sir. I've been
looking forward to meeting you.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.520
Yes, just around the corner, sir.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.440
Keep to the left, please, sir.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.240
Morning. Hi.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.760
This way.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.800
Who's Johnny Cash?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.680
That's Eurof Daniel.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.640
Local preacher and friend of Helen
Jenkins, the woman who lives here.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.720
Mrs?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.040
Miss. Mid 60s, devout chapel-goer.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.440
No children, no close family.
Wasn't at chapel this morning.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.400
He came to check to see
if she was OK,

03:38.400 --> 03:40.880
found the door wide open
and the carnage inside.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.640
I'll need to speak to him.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.160
He already knows that, sir.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.920
You'll need these, sir.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.240
Thanks.

FLIES BUZZ

04:22.840 --> 04:25.480
You got a bag? James, bag.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.680
A broken tooth. Nasty.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.520
Vivid. Not my colour.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.640
Might be just another wild bath night
in Aberystwyth, but I doubt it.

DI Rhys.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.600
She's definitely not in hospital
and there's no sign of her car,

06:10.600 --> 06:12.560
but we've mobilised
all available personnel

06:12.560 --> 06:14.040
and checking all possible leads.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.360
What does she drive? Red Rover.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.400
Big enough to move a body? Yes, sir.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.520
That's cheerful. Huh?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.840
Salem, by Sydney Vosper.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.680
The devil's face is said to be
hidden

06:26.680 --> 06:28.680
in the folds of the Welsh
lady's shawl.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.720
My grandmother showed it to me
when I was small.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.680
It still gives me the creeps.
Do you see it?

06:36.280 --> 06:39.320
No. Perhaps you're not looking
hard enough, sir.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.320
Perhaps I need
the help of your grandmother.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.240
KNOCK AT DOOR

06:50.320 --> 06:52.400
When was the last time
you saw Helen Jenkins?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.520
Last Monday.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.120
You seem very sure about that.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.560
I see Helen every Monday.
She cleans the chapel.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.240
Has done so for many years.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.600
Are you a regular visitor here,
Mr Daniel? No.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.480
Helen likes her own company.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.160
Keen boat builder, was she?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.360
Not as far as I know.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.120
Someone she knows is.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.600
Can't imagine who.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.080
Where were you last night?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.680
At home. I, um...
Can anybody verify that?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.320
Verify?

07:27.320 --> 07:30.960
Mr Daniel's wife passed away
less than a year ago, sir.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.960
I'm sorry to hear that, Eurof.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.480
We'll be in touch.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.520
How long have you known him?

07:43.520 --> 07:45.400
Most of my life.
He's a family friend.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.960
Good man? Absolutely.
Further to fall, then.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.880
Oh, for God's sake!
You can't suspect him.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.000
Excuse me, sir. The super's here
to see you. Thank you, Ellis.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.560
You've met most of the team, then?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.200
A little sooner than expected.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.720
I've got half the cognoscenti
of Aberystwyth

08:14.720 --> 08:18.280
in their Sunday chinos waiting
to meet you up at the university.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.920
It's been a busy day, sir.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.520
Not every Sunday is like this.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.440
I hear you've already mobilised

08:25.440 --> 08:28.520
most of the police resources
of west Wales.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.400
Do you have a body? Not yet.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.360
Well, it's a big call
for a missing person.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.159
It was a vicious attack, sir.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.799
And if the victim is Helen Jenkins,

08:37.799 --> 08:39.799
she's already lost a great deal
of blood.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.600
Unless she's had medical attention
in the last 12 hours,

08:42.600 --> 08:45.120
as far as I'm concerned,
this is a murder inquiry.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.720
OK. Keep me informed. I will.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.480
Thank you, sir.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.320
CHURCH BELLS PEAL

08:55.320 --> 08:59.360
Forensics say there may be three
or four different shoe marks
in the hallway of the chalet.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.000
There's no sign of forced entry
or anything to suggest

09:02.000 --> 09:03.840
that it was a robbery
that went wrong,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.320
so perhaps she knew her assailant.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.120
Sorry I'm late, sir. DS Owens.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.000
Don't be late again.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.640
I won't be, sir.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.880
Saturday night, Helen Jenkins

09:24.880 --> 09:27.360
lays out some clean clothes
and takes a bath.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.000
She puts on some red lipstick.
She wants to look nice.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.480
For who? The boat builder?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.560
Or the preacher?

09:34.560 --> 09:37.280
But for some reason
is attacked violently.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.680
Her teeth are knocked out. Stabbed?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.760
No weapon has been found,

09:40.760 --> 09:44.120
but the excessive blood loss would
suggest that kind of attack.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.440
So there's a struggle.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.040
The Vosper painting is smashed,
then she's dragged outside,

09:48.040 --> 09:51.800
put in the back of the car
and driven into the night. Why?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.280
For dumping, sir?
Possibly, if she's already dead.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.760
And if not?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.600
The killer wanted her to suffer.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.000
Find out all you can
about Helen Jenkins.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.280
From what we can gather,
she lived a quiet, frugal existence.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.320
But who does she know?

10:07.320 --> 10:10.000
And more importantly, who might have
a motive strong enough

10:10.000 --> 10:12.640
to want to hurt her so badly?
Yes, sir.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.560
I've already done a bit of homework
on Helen Jenkins, sir.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.720
She ran the Pontarfynach
Children's Home

10:17.720 --> 10:20.080
from 1979 till it closed in '96.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.080
It's now the Devil's Bridge Hotel,
sir.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.520
Devil's Bridge?
On the A4120 out of Aber, sir.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.360
It's about 20 minutes away
to the southeast.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.560
Hm. It's as clear as day when
you know what you're looking for.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.360
If you don't eat your greens,
we'll send you to Devil's Bridge.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.440
I was scared stiff of the place
when I was a kid.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.520
How come?

11:06.520 --> 11:10.520
According to legend, it's where the
devil was tricked by an old lady.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.520
One day, an old lady
and her cow got separated.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.040
She was on one side of the river,
the cow was on the other.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.720
While she was standing there
wondering how to get it back,

11:21.720 --> 11:24.360
the devil appeared
and offered to build her a bridge.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.800
But his price was the soul of the
first living thing to cross it.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.720
She agreed. Next morning, bingo!
There's a bridge.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.080
The devil says, "I've kept
my promise, now you keep yours."

11:37.080 --> 11:39.600
The old lady took
a loaf of bread out of her basket,

11:39.600 --> 11:43.720
threw it across the bridge
and her dog ran after it.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.080
So the devil was tricked
by an old lady.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.720
Yep. The devil was so embarrassed,
he never set foot in Wales again.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.160
Some would say that he never left.

PING!

13:09.520 --> 13:10.960
Check out the back.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.000
Hello?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.960
'Alfie!'

13:31.520 --> 13:33.440
'Alfie!'

13:43.440 --> 13:46.600
Alfie!

13:48.600 --> 13:51.080
The bugger doesn't listen
to a word I say.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.800
My dog.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.800
He's down there somewhere.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.120
Oh, he'll come back when he's ready.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.600

FAINT POLICE RADIO

17:07.079 --> 17:09.800
Get that.
I'll see you in my office at 5:00.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.440
Why haul the body
all the way out here?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.079
Why risk getting caught?

17:15.079 --> 17:16.720
Maybe it wasn't pre-planned.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.040
He thought she was dead

17:18.040 --> 17:20.440
and panicked when he realised
she was still alive.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.599
Alive or dead, the killer
was making a statement.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.160
He was bringing Helen Jenkins home.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
You'd be pushed to call this home.
Not if you're the devil.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.600
I need the name of all of the kids

17:35.600 --> 17:38.280
that went through the home during
the time Helen Jenkins ran it.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.600
The children, staff,
anyone connected with the place.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.680
I want to know who they were
and where are they now.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.160
We're already working on it, sir.
Good.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.520
Dr Haydn Blake's on his way in.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.000
Helen Jenkins
was his cleaner for three years.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.520
I'll send someone down
to talk to him.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.960
No. You do this one yourself, Tom.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.400
Haydn's a good friend, plays
a big part in our community here.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.600
He'll appreciate the personal touch.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
Right, sir.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.040
Helen was our cleaner.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.520
She worked at the surgery
for three years. She was good.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.240
But we started to notice
money was missing.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.960
How much?

18:23.960 --> 18:26.880
Only small sums.
£10 here, £20 there.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.440
But it added up over the months.
So, you sacked her?

18:30.720 --> 18:32.320
It wasn't just the money.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.880
She started handing these out
to some of my patients.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.280
Young women mostly.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.520
Warning them of the perils of sin.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.960
I couldn't allow that.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.880
And when was this?

18:46.880 --> 18:48.160
Six months ago.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.560
Pity. New cleaner's not a patch
on Helen.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.480
Thank you very much, Dr Blake.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.360
We missed you this afternoon.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.880
At our little gathering.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.960
You were there?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.800
We were all there.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.320
KNOCK AT DOOR

19:09.320 --> 19:10.600
Yep?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.760
Excuse me, sir.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.720
I've been looking into Miss Jenkins'
accounts, sir.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.680
No major debts, no mortgage.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.360
Makes regular small contributions
to the chapel fund.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.240
Forensics? Thanks.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.240
£50 usually. Less in recent months.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.160
She lost her job. But she made
two other payments, sir.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.800
Big ones in April and September.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.600
Both of £500
and both to a Hywel Maybury.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.320
He works at the amusements
on the pier, sir.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.400
Good work.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.960
How's your accommodation, sir?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.400
Perfect, thank you, DC Ellis.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
How's yours?

19:51.600 --> 19:55.560
Um...very good, sir. Thank you.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.800
"The night is far spent,
the day is at hand.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.240
"Let us therefore cast off the works
of darkness

20:07.240 --> 20:09.640
"and let us put on
the armour of light."

20:09.640 --> 20:13.920
Not what you want to hear
in the doctor's surgery on a Monday
morning with two screaming kids.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.720
A religious zealot?

20:15.720 --> 20:18.280
Or a devout woman who sincerely
believed she was helping.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.240
Whilst stealing the petty cash?

20:20.240 --> 20:22.160
Where's the quote from?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.360
St Paul to the Romans.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.400
You went to Sunday school.
Perhaps I still do, sir.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.360
Hywel Maybury?

21:46.480 --> 21:49.520
Hywel Maybury's flat
is on the first floor.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.800
Any idea of his movements?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.800
I can't say. Hywel is that quiet,
it's hard to tell if he's in or not.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.880
Try, Mr Latimer.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.600
Well, I let his mam in last Tuesday,
if that's any help?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.640
His mother? Yeah. She comes in
every week to clean.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.960
His mammy cleans for him, does she?
Well, I think so.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.440
Did he have any other visitors?
Girlfriend...?

22:44.320 --> 22:45.880
Coch-y-bonddu.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.920
Classic trout fly.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.160
Good, isn't he?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.520
You into fishing, Inspector?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.360
No.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.000
Sir?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.080
Is this Hywel Maybury?

23:46.840 --> 23:48.080
Yes.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.640
And that's his mam.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.320
WAVES CRASH

24:00.440 --> 24:04.120
Helen Jenkins was brutally assaulted
in her own home,

24:04.120 --> 24:05.560
then taken to Devil's Bridge,

24:05.560 --> 24:08.200
where we believe she was dumped
in a river.

24:08.200 --> 24:13.600
She ran Pontarfynach Children's Home
between 1979 and 1996.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.080
And we're very keen to speak
to ex residents at the home,

24:17.080 --> 24:19.440
especially Hywel Maybury,

24:19.440 --> 24:22.360
who we believe was a close
acquaintance of Miss Jenkins.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.440
The victim's car, a red Rover 100,

24:26.440 --> 24:30.200
registration N347 EP0,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.760
was used by the killer to move her.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.720
The car is still missing
and it is vital that we find it.

24:38.120 --> 24:41.520
Any questions? Helen Jenkins cleaned
for Maybury, gave him money.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.800
Was she his lover?
Is that why she wore the lipstick?

24:43.800 --> 24:46.080
Maybe the lipstick wasn't for him
and he got jealous?

24:46.080 --> 24:47.920
Or was she the mother he never had?

24:47.920 --> 24:51.080
Helen Jenkins had several assistants
at Pontarfynach,

24:51.080 --> 24:52.960
but it seems she was the only one
who lived in.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.720
How many children went through
there during Helen Jenkins' time?

24:55.720 --> 24:58.440
Almost 50. Apart from Hywel Maybury,
how many have you traced?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.160
Er...seven so far. No, eight.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.280
Only one still in Aberystwyth.
Most have moved away, sir.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.920
Getting as far away from the place
as possible, if you ask me.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.960
But we're not asking you.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.560
It's just an opinion.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.240
If you're unhappy, I suggest...
I didn't say I was unhappy, I...

25:12.240 --> 25:14.080
Just give us the facts, Sian,
please!

25:16.720 --> 25:18.080
I didn't mean to snap.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.360
Where were we? Catrin John.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.120
She's the only one we've traced
who's still in Aberystwyth.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.960
She lives on the Glanrhyd estate
now.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.360
Number? 32.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.600
We're talking to everyone
who knew Miss Jenkins,

25:52.600 --> 25:56.200
trying to get an idea of her
movements over the last week or so.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.320
The Pontarfynach kids
are a good place to start.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.640
Plenty of them will be glad
she's dead.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.080
Including you?

26:04.120 --> 26:07.200
Once, definitely. Not now.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.560
What's changed?

26:10.760 --> 26:14.800
Me. I've made something of my life.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.640
Nice house, happy marriage.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.240
And a baby.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.160
My little Awen, yes.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.720
That bad start made me what I am.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.960
Now I'm a mother,
so something good came out of it.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.120
Hm.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.000
Have you had any contact
with Helen Jenkins recently?

26:33.880 --> 26:37.440
No. She's part of my past.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.960
I'd rather she'd stayed there.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.280
Did she treat you badly?

26:42.640 --> 26:44.440
There were rumours of cruelty.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.080
They were true.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.000
And not just to the kids either.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.560
She was horrible to everyone there.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.680
Especially Byron. Byron?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.920
Byron Rodgers.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.200
Odd-job man and gardener.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.640
Did anything she told him.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.120
Does Byron still live locally?

27:06.120 --> 27:08.920
I've no idea, sorry.

27:08.920 --> 27:13.040
Where were you last Saturday
evening? I was...here.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.560
Can anyone vouch for that?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.960
Only Awen.
But she can't talk yet, bless her.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.160
Where was your husband?

27:21.160 --> 27:23.240
Dyfed? Away.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.200
Singing. He's in a choir.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.120
I'm really sorry,
but Awen's due her feed.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.760
Do you mind if I see to her?

27:31.760 --> 27:34.720
No, not at all. Carry on.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.680
Tidy in there. Very.

27:43.680 --> 27:47.280
My house was a tip
when my daughter, Elin, was a baby.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.600
Elin. Nice name.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.000
She's a nice girl.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.160
I hope you're not looking for
guests.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.760
Business bad? Bloody awful.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.160
And bodies in the ravine won't help.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.760
Horrible. We should never have
bought this place.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.600
We? Me and Daf. Daft bugger.

28:44.600 --> 28:48.600
When was that? '98.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.440
You should have seen the place
when we moved in.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.560
The authority couldn't afford
the repairs,

28:53.560 --> 28:55.680
so they just locked up
and walked away.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.640
It was six months before we were
able to take our first paying
guests.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.600
How many rooms? 15. Staff?

29:01.600 --> 29:04.640
Just me. Getting people out here
is a bit of a nightmare.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.160
What's through there? Top floor.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.880
Daf had big plans,
but they didn't include dying.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.240
It's not been touched.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.200
It's still the Pontarfynach
Children's Home up there.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.640
WINGS FLUTTER

29:58.720 --> 30:00.520
Celtic? What?

30:00.520 --> 30:02.680
That spiral.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.400
Looks more like a Walnut Whip to me.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.200
The kids who were here, we assumed.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.200
The authority promised to
take it all away.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.560
Looks like case notes.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.440
Can I take these?

30:43.440 --> 30:44.840
Take 'em all, love.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.280
I hate it up here.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.640
Daf used to tease, but I swear...

30:56.680 --> 30:57.880
..some nights...

31:01.360 --> 31:02.840
I'll leave you to it.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.400
FLY BUZZES

31:36.680 --> 31:39.560
Everyone who's stayed here
in the last three years is in there.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.640
Perfect, can I borrow this too?

31:44.640 --> 31:47.280
Be my guest.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.520
Thanks.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.560
Hope you catch him soon.

32:00.560 --> 32:05.000
CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY

32:05.000 --> 32:07.280
See if any of the names
in there match

32:07.280 --> 32:09.080
those on the Pontarfynach list.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.240
And find me a Super 8 projector.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.800
Super 8, sir. Right.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.160
Dyfed Williams was exactly where
Catrin says he was -
choral trip to Lampeter.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.880
Coach dropped him off just after
half-eleven on Saturday.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.000
Read this. Any progress?

32:21.000 --> 32:24.600
Getting there, but it's slow.
These all joined the army...

32:24.600 --> 32:27.640
these emigrated, or moved abroad.
These...?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.240
Dead.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.720
Any news on Byron Rodgers?

32:30.720 --> 32:33.480
Does odd jobs around the place, sir.
We've got an address for him.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.520
Listen to this - "...is bed-wetting
now on a nightly basis... constant

32:37.520 --> 32:41.320
"demands for attention... confined
to Hard Room for weekend".

32:41.320 --> 32:42.920
"Hard room"?

32:42.920 --> 32:45.640
Signed Helen Jenkins.
No wonder they hated her.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.920
TRAIN HORN BLARES

33:29.080 --> 33:30.840
Byron Rodgers?

33:30.840 --> 33:32.000
Yes?

33:34.240 --> 33:36.520
Have you got a minute?

33:36.520 --> 33:38.600
I'd like to talk to you
about Helen Jenkins.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.720
I looked after the house
and gardens.

33:44.720 --> 33:48.000
Drove the mini-bus to the
chapel on Sundays.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.080
Did you and Helen get on?

33:50.080 --> 33:52.040
She was my boss.
That's not what I asked.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.080
Yes. I got on with her.

TRAIN PASSES

33:58.720 --> 34:00.600
When did you last speak with her?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.640
I haven't spoken to her in years.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.080
But you were her right-hand man.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.840
I was just doing my job.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.760
Do you remember Hywel Maybury?

34:12.880 --> 34:16.280
Yes. Did Helen Jenkins treat him
differently to the other children?

34:16.280 --> 34:20.000
Differently? Well, did she favour
him more - mistreat him more - than
the others?

34:20.000 --> 34:23.560
No.
Did you agree with her methods?

34:23.560 --> 34:26.199
It wasn't my place to agree
or disagree.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.920
When was the last time you
saw Maybury?

34:38.679 --> 34:40.560
Where were you Saturday night?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.400
Here. Alone?

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
Yes. Doing what?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.679
Working on this.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.840
Yeah, that's received
from Delta Charlie zero four.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.120
Catrin John's best friend
at the home was Jenny James.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.160
They were quite a pair.

40:20.160 --> 40:23.440
The tabloids christened them
"Satan's Daughters".

40:23.440 --> 40:26.480
1987,
they set light to their school.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.960
Both had records for difficult,

40:27.960 --> 40:31.760
violent behaviour. Pontarfynach was
last chance saloon.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.640
Next stop the remand home.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.280
Helen Jenkins made an off-the-cuff
comment about them being

40:36.280 --> 40:41.120
proof of innate evil, original sin
and the need to drive out the devil.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.080
The press leapt on it.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.240
Salem.

40:44.240 --> 40:47.160
She said that they were possessed,
but actually they were just

40:47.160 --> 40:50.520
two nine-year-old foster kids, who'd
been badly let down by the system.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.160
Jenny James...

40:52.160 --> 40:54.040
Regular customer over the years,
sir.

40:54.040 --> 40:57.080
Minor stuff mostly -
petty theft, D&D.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.440
Initially we traced her to
an address in the Grangetown

40:59.440 --> 41:01.440
area of Cardiff,
but I double-checked.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.560
And...? She's back in Aberystwyth.
Not far from the harbour.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.560
KNOCKS DOOR

41:32.400 --> 41:34.360
Does Jenny James live here?

41:34.360 --> 41:35.600
Now what...?

41:40.440 --> 41:43.440
Last time I saw her was
Saturday morning.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.120
We had a row.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.360
What was it about?

41:46.360 --> 41:50.920
What it's always about. This,
this...and this.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.280
She'll be back in a day or so.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.200
In a right mess -

41:57.200 --> 42:00.120
"I'm so sorry, Lee.
Please forgive me, Lee."

42:01.280 --> 42:03.880
Yeah, right(!) Till the next time.

42:07.320 --> 42:11.360
Only, she's never stayed away
this long before.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.280
She sleeps in here
when we've had a ruck

42:25.280 --> 42:28.080
which is
like always these days.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.160
Did you run out of paint?

42:32.160 --> 42:35.400
I was trying to cheer her up a bit.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.440
She went mental,
ranting on about how

42:38.440 --> 42:41.880
she didn't deserve nothing
apart from a hard room.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.400
And then she just buggered off.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.200
I just want her to be happy.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.840
We'll need a photo.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.040
It was mischief. A prank.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.120
But the papers made out it was some
sort of Satanic ritual.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.840
The truth is,

43:09.840 --> 43:13.440
Jenny and I were never taught the
difference between right and wrong.

43:13.440 --> 43:15.040
Until you met Helen Jenkins?

43:16.800 --> 43:21.920
She certainly thought she knew the
difference - and how to teach us.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.880
Why didn't you mention this before?

43:26.880 --> 43:28.200
Didn't seem relevant.

43:31.240 --> 43:34.040
It was such a long time ago
and we were kids.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.320
When the home closed, I wanted to
get as far away from it as possible.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.680
I knew I'd been bad

43:44.680 --> 43:47.320
but it seemed like an ideal moment
to make a new start.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.040
Problem was, Jenny couldn't.

43:52.160 --> 43:55.320
She got in with the wrong crowd
and we went our separate ways.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.960
But you were close once?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.640
Once.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.520
She was the only friend
I had in the world, Mr Mathias.

Mathias. You'd better get back here
as soon as possible, sir.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.200
Why, what is it?

48:43.200 --> 48:45.440
Jenny James has just turned herself
in.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.000
She says she killed Helen Jenkins.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.840
Why were you hiding there, Hywel?

49:16.440 --> 49:17.640
Were you scared?

49:21.880 --> 49:24.840
Were you running away because you
did something you were ashamed of?

49:31.760 --> 49:33.600
Did you kill Helen Jenkins, Hywel?

49:37.760 --> 49:40.000
How did you kill her?
I hit her.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.680
With what?

49:41.680 --> 49:43.280
A vase. Smashed her head in.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.200
Knocked the bitch's teeth out.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.480
Why did you do that?

49:48.560 --> 49:52.680
She took out our teeth with no
anaesthetic, liked seeing us suffer.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.120
I gave her a taste of her own
medicine.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.840
Then what did you do?

49:58.840 --> 50:00.000
Stabbed her.

50:01.680 --> 50:05.240
Dragged her out the
front door and put her in the car.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.000
What sort of car?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.040
A little red one.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.200
Then I drove it
up to Devil's Bridge.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.800
And then what did you do?

50:14.880 --> 50:17.120
Stopped on the bridge.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.840
Pulled her
out and shoved her into the river.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.000
Did you have help?

50:22.000 --> 50:23.600
WHISPERS: No.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.480
You took her out of the car

50:25.480 --> 50:28.120
and lifted her over
the parapet on your own?

50:29.440 --> 50:31.000
Yeah.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.880
You look happy the both of you.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.360
I was happy.

50:47.820 --> 50:48.940
She was happy.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.260
It was a happy day.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.740
Sounds lovely.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.100
Tell me about it.

50:57.100 --> 50:58.220
It was my birthday.

51:00.620 --> 51:02.140
So, I went out fishing...

51:04.460 --> 51:06.580
..and I caught
a sea bass and she cooked it for me.

51:06.580 --> 51:08.940
Helen? Did Helen cook the fish?

51:10.340 --> 51:12.820
Is that why you went round
there on Saturday?

51:12.820 --> 51:15.180
So she could cook for you?

51:15.180 --> 51:17.020
What happened on Saturday, Hywel?

51:18.740 --> 51:19.780
I was scared.

51:21.740 --> 51:23.700
That's why I ran away.

51:23.700 --> 51:25.740
Did she do something that
made you angry?

51:27.020 --> 51:28.380
It wasn't my fault.

51:30.540 --> 51:32.580
I went there,
because I used to live there.

51:32.580 --> 51:33.980
To Helen's house?

51:33.980 --> 51:36.060
The hotel!

51:36.060 --> 51:37.940
We lived there once.
It was our home.

51:40.220 --> 51:41.660
I thought I'd be safe.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.180
But nowhere's safe.

51:44.180 --> 51:46.660
They always spit in your face.
Who does?

51:46.660 --> 51:49.020
Everyone! They blame me.

51:50.300 --> 51:53.380
It wasn't my fault!

51:53.380 --> 51:55.100
Did Helen blame you, Hywel?

51:56.300 --> 51:57.780
Is that why you were angry?

51:59.620 --> 52:02.740
Did she shout at you?
Did she call you names?

52:02.740 --> 52:04.300
Is that why you hurt her?

52:06.260 --> 52:07.620
HYWEL!

52:07.620 --> 52:10.380
I didn't hurt her!
I didn't touch her!

52:10.380 --> 52:11.900
I didn't. I didn't!

52:11.900 --> 52:14.140
That's enough.

52:14.140 --> 52:17.300
HE SHIVERS

52:17.300 --> 52:18.900
He was there.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.860
His waders match the prints in the
chalet. He was there.

52:21.860 --> 52:24.780
Did he kill her? He's certainly
capable of killing her.

52:24.780 --> 52:27.700
Whatever he did, whatever he saw,
he's deeply traumatised by it.

52:27.700 --> 52:31.020
Could it be an act?
No, no, I think it's genuine.

52:31.020 --> 52:32.980
DCI Mathias...?

52:32.980 --> 52:34.140
I'm sorry,

52:34.140 --> 52:37.540
but my client isn't in any fit
mental state to be interviewed.

52:37.540 --> 52:40.620
I'd like him psychologically
assessed before further questioning.

52:40.620 --> 52:43.180
With respect, I think
you're being a little premature.

52:43.180 --> 52:46.020
Let me continue the interview if
he breaks down again, then I'll...

52:46.020 --> 52:48.220
I'm sorry. It has to stop now.
Ms Walters,

52:48.220 --> 52:52.100
this is a murder enquiry, our primary
concern is, is to find the killer.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.260
Can I suggest that
we trust the judgment of

52:55.260 --> 52:58.220
Dr Haydn Blake, our police surgeon
in assessing Mr Maybury's

52:58.220 --> 52:59.340
fitness to continue?

53:00.740 --> 53:03.380
Feel free to use
the phone in my office. Please.

DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

53:16.820 --> 53:19.020
Jenny, hi.

53:19.020 --> 53:20.420
Do you know this picture?

53:23.180 --> 53:24.300
Yeah.

53:25.580 --> 53:27.820
She had one
hanging on the wall at the home.

53:29.020 --> 53:31.260
Did she have one anywhere else?

53:33.180 --> 53:34.340
How would I know?

53:38.820 --> 53:42.060
Devil's Bridge is a long way to go
with a body in the back of the car.

53:42.060 --> 53:44.140
Weren't you worried about being
caught?

53:44.140 --> 53:45.500
Never thought about it.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.740
Why Devil's Bridge, Jenny?

53:50.660 --> 53:53.260
It's where she took us
when we'd been bad.

53:54.300 --> 53:58.420
Down the bottom...
said the Devil lived there.

54:00.060 --> 54:02.340
If we didn't repent -

54:02.340 --> 54:05.620
he'd take our souls
and we'd burn in Hell for ever.

54:07.760 --> 54:09.040
Well, she's lying.

54:11.640 --> 54:12.720
There's a knack.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.400
Thanks.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.600
LIQUID POURS

54:17.600 --> 54:19.560
She's lying to protect someone.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.160
Who? Maybury?

54:21.160 --> 54:22.920
He was definitely at the scene.

54:24.280 --> 54:26.960
That's something else you'll have to
get used to around here.

54:26.960 --> 54:29.160
Do you think I came here by choice?

54:29.160 --> 54:31.400
The official line
is that you did, yeah.

54:32.760 --> 54:34.000
And unofficially?

54:35.320 --> 54:38.080
We're in luck.
You can question Maybury again.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.560
Oh, thank you, sir.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.480
Dr Blake is a valuable resource
to have at our disposal.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.960
So I see.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.360
Right, let's get on with it.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.560
SHAKING: I should have told her.

54:59.560 --> 55:00.840
Her...?

55:00.840 --> 55:01.840
Helen...

55:03.080 --> 55:05.720
Miss Jenkins. I should have
told her and not been ashamed

55:05.720 --> 55:07.280
of what they'd say.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.640
She helped me.

55:14.640 --> 55:18.200
She gave me money
and she hardly had any for herself.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.080
She cared for me.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.200
He had a boat.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.600
Who did?

55:31.600 --> 55:32.920
Her grandfather.

55:34.880 --> 55:36.800
He used to take her out in his boat.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.720
They used to catch fish
and cook it on the fire.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.280
She said she was happy then.

55:46.320 --> 55:48.440
But when he died
she lost the boat too.

55:49.560 --> 55:53.720
I said I'd build her a boat and take
her out fishing, like she used to.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.080
To pay her back for helping me.

56:01.440 --> 56:05.640
I wanted her to know that
I needed her to be like a mother is.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.360
And I wanted her to need me
like a son...

56:13.080 --> 56:14.280
..and she did.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.560
It was our secret...

56:19.840 --> 56:21.440
..so I told nobody.

56:23.040 --> 56:26.360
But you've told us, Hywel,
that's a good thing...

56:28.640 --> 56:30.840
..because we're going
to find out who hurt her.

56:33.360 --> 56:37.520
So, you need to tell us
what happened, what you saw,

56:37.520 --> 56:39.280
when you went to Helen's house.

56:40.600 --> 56:41.920
Will you do that for us?

56:43.640 --> 56:44.840
Hywel...

56:46.880 --> 56:48.000
..for Helen's sake?

56:53.240 --> 56:54.920
I'd been fishing...

56:57.720 --> 56:59.080
..I caught two fish.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.440
I came up from the beach,
to Helen's house.

57:05.960 --> 57:08.840
The door was open.
Banging in the wind.

57:11.080 --> 57:14.280
I saw a car leave. Helen's car.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.840
SUSPENSEFUL SCORE

57:15.840 --> 57:17.480
Could you see who was driving?

57:17.480 --> 57:19.840
No. No, too dark.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.640
I went into the house.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.400
It was bad. There was blood.

57:29.400 --> 57:30.880
Where?

57:30.880 --> 57:32.120
On the floor.

57:33.560 --> 57:36.680
All over. The bathroom.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.280
Everywhere. Lots of blood.

57:40.680 --> 57:41.920
WHISPERS: I ran away.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.920
I knew they'd blame me.

57:47.080 --> 57:49.720
But I didn't hurt her.

57:49.720 --> 57:51.040
HE SNIFFLES

57:51.040 --> 57:53.080
I should have told her.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.480
Told her what, Hywel?

57:55.840 --> 57:58.080
I wanted to tell her,
but I couldn't.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
CRYING: I didn't kill her!

58:04.920 --> 58:06.080
I loved her.

We've still got plenty of time
to question her.

58:37.160 --> 58:40.080
Let her stew for now, and we'll see
what she has to say in the morning.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.280
Just think what kind of lives those
kids would have had

59:05.280 --> 59:07.200
if their parents had done their job.

59:08.800 --> 59:11.240
It's not rocket science,
just basic care.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.120
"Put your hand over your mouth
when you cough."

59:16.120 --> 59:17.720
"Don't pick your nose in public."

59:17.720 --> 59:20.400
All that small stuff,
it all adds up.

59:24.560 --> 59:30.600
The only thing a child needs
is to feel safe and warm,

59:30.600 --> 59:32.000
and to know that they're loved.

What?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.680
It's a simple question. Who was it?

RATTLES LOUDLY

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.560

You or her?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.480
She did.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.640
Miss Jenkins.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.920
A lot of the children had bad teeth.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.840
They needed to come out.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.480
It wasn't worth bothering
the tooth fairy for...?

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.760
Or worth giving them
anything for the pain?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.000
I didn't like her doing it.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.360
Perhaps I should have stopped her...

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120
So, why didn't you?

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.920
Were you scared of her, too?

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.920
Did she threaten to lock
you in the Hard Room?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.520
Did she say that the Devil would
come and take away your soul,

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.560
that you'd burn in Hell
for ever for your sins?

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.040
I think she was murdered

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.800
because of something that
happened in that home, Byron.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.040
Something you know about.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.720
I didn't kill her. Then who did?

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.080

There's an Emma Jones who's been
staying at the Devil's Bridge Hotel

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.560
every year for the last
three years.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.720
She stays in same room,
on the same date.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.920
January 28th. Except for this year.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.920
The same day Helen Jenkins was
killed? Yes, sir.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.920
She calls herself Emma Jones,

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.520
but she uses the same address we
traced Jenny James to in Grangetown.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.240
And you think that it might be her?

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.760
Yes, sir, using a false name.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.760
I think you're right, Lloyd.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.400
TYRES SQUEAL

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.080
Yes, room ten every January the 28th.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.760
She arrives at tea time,
comes straight up here,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:10.120
emerges the next morning,
has an early breakfast.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.520
"See you next year." Gone.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.760
And you've no idea why
she comes on that particular date?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.800
No. And I've never asked.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.760
As long as she pays and doesn't nick
the towels, I don't much care.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.200
Is this Emma Jones?

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.600
No.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.280
What about her?

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.280
When was this taken?

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.040
When she was about 17.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.760
Well, she hasn't changed that much,
yeah, that's her definitely -

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.160
that's Emma Jones.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.680
Catrin John.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.440
You've got to talk to Jenny James.
Do not release her, you got me?

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.680
Arrest her if you have to, but Jenny
James must not leave the premises...

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.400
Ask her about Catrin -
she's our Emma Jones.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.280
Where's Catrin?

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.640
It's just a name she picked
at random as far as I know.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.040
She was Catrin John when I met her.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.280
And Room ten?
Every January the 28th?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.400
Why that room? That day?

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.920
I don't know.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.800
Perhaps it was to remind
herself of who she once was?

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.720
Why would she do that, when she's
tried so long to forget her past?

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.360
I don't know.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:00.120
You don't seem to know much about
your own wife at all, Mr Williams.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.960
I thought I knew her.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.960
Catrin only wanted to be married
and have a family.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.640
But...

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.920
Having a baby must have meant
so much to you.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.680
Awen, isn't it?

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.400
Yes.
Where is she now?

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.600
She's upstairs.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.600
Well, she's very quiet.
Is she asleep?

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.280
Yes.
Can I see a photograph?

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.560
I... took them all down.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.960
Why, Dyfed?

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.680
I left Catrin two months ago.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.120
Where were you on Saturday night?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.760
I was singing with the choir.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.800
Minibus dropped me off outside,
like always.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.640
Did you come into the house?

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.280
I walked back to the B&B.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.000
I tried to understand,
I tried to protect her...

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:08.600
..but it's like there's a part of her
locked away I just can't reach.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.760
Catrin was raped.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:18.680
At the home.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:23.640
She was 13 and she got pregnant.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.960
Who was it, Jenny?

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.000
I don't know. Neither does she.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.479
You've no idea, have you?

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:34.319
Not a clue what that place was like.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.160
We were drugged most of the time.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.760
Diazepam and pin-down.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.319
Locked up in the Hard Room,
if we so much as raised our voices.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.560
Hard Room?

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.120
On the first floor.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.160
That's where it happened.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.680
TRANSLATED FROM WELSH

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.359
As soon as the baby started to show,
Catrin was hidden away,

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:02.600
out of sight.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.680
That's when she started to change.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.680
Wasn't interested in me any more,
only her baby.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.680
She was everything to me...

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.040
I was nothing to her after that.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.760
Nothing.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.399
And the baby?

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.840
Catrin had the baby.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.000
Jenkins let her hold her for a bit.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.200
Then she took the little thing away.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.279
Catrin has never seen Emma since.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.240
Emma Jones.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.960
That was the baby's name.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.800
Fresh air?

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.800
Just a walk round the block.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.280
Haven't you forgotten something?

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120
The baby?

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.040
She's with Catrin.
You said you were looking after her.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.640
I am.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.720
I was.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.280
Shall I go and check if she's there?
No, please. I'd rather you didn't...

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.320
Where's Catrin gone, Dyfed?

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.320
I only lied because I love her...

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.080
I wrote to her

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.520
when I was in Cardiff,
told her how much I missed her.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.960
She never wrote back.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.600
So I came back to see her.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.920
But she wasn't interested in me.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.960
All she wanted to know was what
happened to Emma.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.320
I told her. I didn't know
where her baby was...

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.280
She said she'd do to me
what she'd done to Helen Jenkins

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.560
if I didn't tell her...

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.600
I was scared...

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.040
..she was going to kill me...

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.920
I just told her...

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.480
What did you tell her, Jenny?

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.680

Catrin John is

She has killed once
and is likely to kill again....

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.360
Catrin and Jenny both suffered at
the hands of the gutter press as
children.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.360
I'm just asking that we keep
this low-key, restrained, sir.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.280
I can assure you, Tom,
anything I issue to the press will

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.760

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.320

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.920
And then it just happened.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.200
Suddenly she was pregnant
and it was like Christmas every day.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.880
She was so happy.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.960
Three weeks before full term,
the baby stopped moving.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.960
She had the scan and...

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.960
Baby had died.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.760
Called her Awen.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.480
She insisted on keeping the nursery

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.000

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.360
No, Catrin, don't...

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.480
What are you doing here?

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.720
I'm here to help you.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.160
This is between me and Mr Daniel.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.240
Mr Daniel doesn't know
where Emma is.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.360
HE SIMPERS

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.160
But I might be able to find her.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.200
How?

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.080
I'm a detective.

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.760
Finding people is what I do.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.200
We've already started
looking for her.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.280
Where?

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.920
Give me the scissors, then
we can go and find her together.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.400
I'm not going to hurt you, trust me.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.720
I don't trust anyone, they just...

01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.880
Was it you?! Was
it you who raped me?!

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.080
No... no, it wasn't me.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.520
He hurt me...

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.040
Jenny heard him...

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.720
..she tried to help me.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.240
She loves you.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.480
I know.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.360
MARED: Right, you're coming with me.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.520
She misses you...

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.360
..that's why she's
come with me to see you.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.840
She's outside,
waiting to talk to you.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.320
Would you like to see her?

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.680
Give me your hand, and
we'll go out together to see her.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.080
No!

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.160
Catrin, it's OK...

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.320
CATRIN: Jenny!

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.680
No!

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.120
Are you out there?

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.720
I've got to talk to her.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.480
Please, let me
go in and talk to her.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.360
No, it's too risky.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.000
You're lying,
she's not out there. JENNY!

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.320
Jenny, stop!

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.840
JENNY!

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.240
Catrin!

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.880
We've been looking for Catrin,
haven't we, Jenny?

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.960
Yeah, we have.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.320
I've missed you.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.320
I've been looking for Emma.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.720
I know.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.280
I can't find her.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.080
Byron wouldn't tell me.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.080
I didn't want to hurt him,
but he just wouldn't say.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.600
He didn't know, Catrin, that's why.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.800
Then why did you tell me he did?

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.680
Because I was scared...

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.720
I thought you'd hurt me.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.440
Jenny. As if.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.960
But I know now.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.800
I know where Emma is.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.320
Where? They took her away.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.080
And I could hear you
screaming for her.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.880
I was under the stairs.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.240
You know that little place
where we used to hide?

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.280
Where is she, Jenny?!
Where is my baby?

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.720
I went into the room...

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.600
..where little Emma was.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.080
She was asleep...

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.800
..and she was beautiful.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.440
So beautiful.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.360
And I knew...

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.640
..that you'd love her
more than me...

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.080
..and I didn't want you
to stop loving me.

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.440
I was afraid that
she'd take my place...

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.440
..a little angel.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.080
So I took her breath away...

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.240
So that
she'd be with the angels.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.640
Always with the angels.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.080
And I would be with you.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.960
No.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.200
It's the truth.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.800
I did it because I love you.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.360
I love you.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.360
CATRIN SCREAMS

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.560
SHE SOBS

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.320
SCISSORS DROP

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.440
SHE SOBS

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.800
RADIO CHATTER

01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.420
Helen told me
the child had died in its sleep.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.380
I had no reason not to believe her.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:07.260
She thought that the bad publicity

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.580
would lead to
the closure of the home.

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.540
She begged me not to say anything.

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:21.380
I...blessed the child...and
the ground...

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.500
..and then we laid her to rest.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.860
We buried her.

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:36.460
Myself, Helen and Byron.

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.100
HE SOBS

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.100
I think I know where.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.300
Byron was trying to tell us.

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:08.020
HAUNTING SONG SCORE

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.020
SHE SOBS

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.940
SHE CONTINUES SOBBING

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.460
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

01:34:21.305 --> 01:34:27.334
