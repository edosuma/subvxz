00:04.213 --> 00:06.955
If I go into that barn
when hunter meteor storm hits,

00:07.091 --> 00:08.046
troubles disappear.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.632
For 27 years, they're gone.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.170
The Guard wants Audrey
in the barn tomorrow.

00:11.304 --> 00:12.965
I'm not letting Audrey go anywhere.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.304
You know, you always come back
with a different name,

00:15.433 --> 00:17.640
but underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.316
Audrey, stop!

00:24.442 --> 00:25.807
That won't work on the barn.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.058

—Duke.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.492

00:36.621 --> 00:38.327
Duke, we all thought
you were dead.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.209
Instead, I thought I killed her.
I thought I killed you.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.542
Everything that's happening
in this town is my fault.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.375
This is Jennifer.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.005
She's troubled,
connected to the barn somehow.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.837
She heard Audrey talking.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.173
By killing the person
she loves the most,

00:51.302 --> 00:53.008
she could end the troubles forever.

That guy was here because of me.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.010
He was afraid
I was gonna tell you something.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.853
—Like what?
—You're someone else entirely.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.143
Unless you let me help you

01:07.276 --> 01:10.063

Okay, my turn.

Nathan Wuornos, Haven P.D.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.228

on that missing person,

01:54.365 --> 01:56.572
Audrey Parker.

01:56.701 --> 01:59.113
I called you 45 minutes ago.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.906
Well, keep me posted.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.905
I thought the FBI
might have had a lead on Audrey.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.158
Listen, I want to find her, too,
but we got bigger problems.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.081
I did my best to keep her intact.

02:10.715 --> 02:13.252
Looks like charcoal.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.126
She's completely incinerated,

02:16.262 --> 02:20.096

teeth, metal.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.385
It would take a liquid accelerant
to burn someone like that,

02:22.518 --> 02:24.179
but that would've sparked
a larger fire.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.974
It's like the victim
was the source of the fire.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.971
Like some kind
of spontaneous combustion?

02:30.860 --> 02:32.100
Got an ID. yet?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.067
Yeah, most of the teeth survived.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.527
I'll run a dental check.

be able to celebrate,

02:47.460 --> 02:49.576

Nathan, listen,
part of your deal with The Guard

03:04.226 --> 03:06.968
is that you help me
with the troubles.

—I know.

—Miss me?

Unless I do what you say,
a lot of people are gonna die.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.959

So, of course my little brother dies
without a will or a body.

If I were my brother Wade,

04:01.826 --> 04:03.862
I would've planned
my unexpected death.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.157
You need a will, too,
especially in Haven.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.200
I'll look into it.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.870

starting to lose patience.

from the barn.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.407
Yeah, it's like a cop gene.

it might help find Audrey.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.295

05:44.929 --> 05:48.467
this town has got tons
of cheap seaside real estate,

05:48.599 --> 05:50.840
but then I started looking
into local insurance costs,

just came to town last night.

combustion trouble?

to settle your estate quickly

Just like Sally Marigold.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.086
Only thing burned was him.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.431
Permit says our victim's name
is Jacob Harcher.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.425
No relation to the Marigolds.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.348
So this isn't their curse.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.393
Which means someone else
is out there incinerating people.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.107
On what's gonna be
the busiest day of the year.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.237
What if there's a connection

12:28.373 --> 12:30.329
between this Vic
and the Marigolds?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.495
Do we know who his last fare was?

12:32.628 --> 12:34.038
Nothing in his log book.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.168
I'd think twice
before you put your hands on me.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.837
This is a crime scene, ma'am.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.210
Sorry, you can't just go walking
wherever you want to.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.338
Stan, let her through.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.386
I heard somebody's
setting people on fire.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.808
I can't talk to you
about an ongoing investigation.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.523
And you've got Nathan out here
looking for them.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.859
He should be riding a desk,
not on the front lines.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.363
We need him.
I need him.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.899
We made a deal.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.239
Audrey Parker gets back,
kills Nathan,

13:04.368 --> 13:06.780
and the troubles end.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.198
Why would you put his life
in danger like this?

13:09.331 --> 13:10.867
He's worked plenty of troubled cases.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.240
Let The Guard find
whoever's doing this.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.708
I'll work with you.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.827
Nathan will be touched
that you're so worried about him.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.671
What I'm worried about
is him getting turned into that.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.961
Because if that happens,
the troubles never end,

13:22.094 --> 13:23.880
and I wear these forever.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.470
And you spend the rest of your life
in that bulletproof vest.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.273
What do you remember
about getting here?

13:38.402 --> 13:39.938
[Sighs]

13:41.071 --> 13:43.528
l was driving across country
in a crappy pick—up

13:43.657 --> 13:45.522
with my crappy boyfriend
when we got in a fight.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.116
I stopped for gas,
and I stole his wallet.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.200
Hitched a ride here,

13:49.329 --> 13:51.240
and I still don't know
how he paid for that gas.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.362
That didn't happen.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.784
You can be my lawyer.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.828
Your boyfriend, the road trip,
the fight,

13:55.961 --> 13:59.624
you remember it,
but you don't feel it.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.008
You ever rode on a bench seat
for four hours straight?

14:02.134 --> 14:03.419
Believe me, I felt it.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.792
That's not what I mean,
and you know it.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.590
You remember the events,
but the emotions,

14:07.723 --> 14:09.429
what were they?

14:09.558 --> 14:11.970
—What did you feel?
—Pissed off.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.967
No, y——

14:14.104 --> 14:15.890
Your boyfriend...

14:16.940 --> 14:17.975
Did you love him?

14:18.692 --> 14:19.807
No.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.854
But you've been in love before,
right?

14:21.987 --> 14:23.773
Real love, big love.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.739
No.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.281
And yet you feel it every day.

14:31.413 --> 14:38.160
It's that ache in your heart,
the weight.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.787
It's for someone that you haven't met
in this lifetime.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.921
Listen, I really do appreciate

14:47.054 --> 14:48.635
what you did
with the guy and the gun,

14:48.764 --> 14:50.379
but I think it's time that you leave.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.131
That other life, I know the city.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.509
It was in Haven, Maine.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.431
You need to remember
what happened there.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.394
No,|dont

14:58.523 --> 15:00.730
You need to finish your beer
and get out.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.278
I mean, this town,
it's like a postcard.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.989
I saw an old woman
actually sweeping the sidewalk,

15:10.118 --> 15:12.404
but there's a family of mermen here?

15:12.537 --> 15:13.697
Like real mermen?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.206
That's the least of it,

15:15.332 --> 15:18.039
which is why I want my brother Wade
to get out of town.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.874
So Haven is too dangerous
for your brother,

15:20.003 --> 15:21.459
but you want me to stay?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.499
My brother Wade
doesn't belong here.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.544
When we were kids
in grade school, he ——

15:26.676 --> 15:29.167
he came to visit one Christmas.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.215
We took him sledding.

15:31.348 --> 15:35.842
We were with this troubled kid
who couldn't feel anything.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.720
And he couldn't feel it
when he broke his arm,

15:39.856 --> 15:45.271
and it was so bad that the bone
was sticking out of his parka.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.644
Now, my brother Wade,

15:47.781 --> 15:49.237
well, he puked,

15:49.366 --> 15:51.402
and he just ——
he freaked out.

15:51.535 --> 15:55.119
He couldn't handle it.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.079
What did you do?

15:58.208 --> 16:02.121
| just carried the kid
to the hospital.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.794
And then I went back to sledding.

16:04.923 --> 16:08.632
I mean, it was a good day.
It was icy.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.801
I don't know what I would have done.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.592
You helped me back in Boston.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.261
You're here now
helping us find Audrey.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.020
I'm pretty sure
you would've helped that kid...

16:23.775 --> 16:26.061
And then gone back to sledding.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.071
You know what? I ——

16:32.200 --> 16:33.315
I should get back to the guy.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.911
| just want to make sure
that he gets out of here.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.540
Do you want to come with or...

16:39.666 --> 16:41.327
No, no.
Go say good—bye to your brother.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.541
I want to go find
some salt—water taffy.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.625
Salt—water taffy, all right.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.040
Well, after that,
there's a coffee shop ——

16:47.174 --> 16:47.833
Black House Coffee.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.708
It's the only place in town
that makes a decent espresso.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.794
Sounds good.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.097
Yeah.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.688
You drink too much of that, you're not
gonna be able to drive home.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.575
You're not gonna be able
to drive home.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.282
Whoa.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.955
Nanny cams.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.043
Not just for nannies anymore.

17:29.758 --> 17:30.838
Who's the guy?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.582
Contractor.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.835
He's supposed to be
installing a skylight,

17:34.971 --> 17:40.307
but I guess he's waiting
until he's done screwing my wife.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.398
Did you know Marcie was cheating?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.232
I suspected.

17:50.362 --> 17:54.196
That's why I installed
the remote access camera.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.656
Wade, I am ——

17:56.785 --> 17:58.366
I'm so sorry.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.737
It's what I get for spending
so much time up here.

18:01.873 --> 18:05.912
But you came here to help me.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.875
I'm not gonna forget that.

18:08.004 --> 18:13.089
Good, 'cause I can't go back
until I lock up my assets

18:13.218 --> 18:14.708
and serve her with the papers.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.584
Okay.
What about your job?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.212
I trade high—tech stocks.
I can ——

18:21.142 --> 18:23.474
I can do that anywhere.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.228
Right.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.222
Look, we'll...

18:29.359 --> 18:31.600
figure something out.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.067
One mocha cappuccino to go.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.705
Thanks.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.214
Ugh. My taffy.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.261
Aaah!

19:29.627 --> 19:32.118
Your friend from Boston's
a very lucky woman.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.587
She missed it by seconds.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.961
It's like those pictures
from Pompei.

19:41.097 --> 19:45.591
That was super—heated volcanic gas
that swept through an entire town.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.843
l'd almost prefer that.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.520
It's the same as before.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.730
The victims are incinerated.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.441
Teeth and metal are intact.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.356
lt'll help with the |.D.s.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.821
Four victims this time.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.360
VVhy?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.577
They wanted coffee.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.254
Hey.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.339
She's pretty shaken up.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.174
Go easy.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.099
ljust wanted a mocha.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.932
I mean, how do people
stay in business in this town?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.096
Where's Duke?

20:29.229 --> 20:30.969
I called him.
He's on the way.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.472
All those people...
They're dead?

20:34.609 --> 20:37.817
Yeah. But you can help us
find out who did it.

20:37.946 --> 20:42.189
So please,
just tell me what you saw.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.663
There was a kid at the counter
with a nose ring,

20:47.789 --> 20:50.030
a woman doing
some charity drive,

20:50.166 --> 20:53.499
and there was a girl
at a computer.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.038
Yeah.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.286
It had to be more than that.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.004
Hey, my meds
make my memory fuzzy,

20:58.133 --> 20:59.873
and, oh, yeah,
I'm kind of freaked out right now.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.340
I understand.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.460
Just —— anyone else?

21:05.515 --> 21:09.349
There was a guy holding
a blue coat with brass buttons.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.341
Um...

21:10.478 --> 21:12.719
And a guy that ordered
an Americano.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.346
That's it.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.269
That's five people.
Thanks.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.069
Jennifer described five people.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.530
We got four victims,
so if we find out who's missing ——

21:24.659 --> 21:26.650
—We find our troubled person.
—Yeah.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.244
We got our barista
with the nose ring...

21:30.373 --> 21:32.364
Fundraiser...

21:33.501 --> 21:34.911
And 75¢.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.375
The exact change you'd get

21:36.504 --> 21:39.086
if you bought an Americano
with a $5 bill here.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.044
I like coffee.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.587
Okay.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.460
I saw the victim with the laptop,

21:45.597 --> 21:50.933
so that leaves a guy in a blue coat
with brass buttons.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.024
The troubled person's
in the fire department.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.397
Are you okay?

22:06.201 --> 22:07.111
Yeah.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.699
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.943
—Hey.
—What?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.910
Can you ID. the guy
in the blue suit?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.705
lthink so.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.574
—Okay, come with me.
—Wait. Hang on a second.

22:16.711 --> 22:17.791
Will you excuse us a moment?

22:17.921 --> 22:19.832
Come here.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.756
Look, you spent all night
interrogating her,

22:23.885 --> 22:25.250
now you want to take her
trouble—hunting?

22:25.386 --> 22:27.047
She can ID. the guy.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.761
I don't care, Nathan.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.757
Look, I don't want her
involved in this,

22:31.893 --> 22:34.760
especially when
that is what happens

22:34.896 --> 22:37.433
when you mess up
a troubled guy's latte.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.851
Now I would prefer
that the nice girl

22:39.984 --> 22:42.145
who broke me out of a mental
institution not get killed

22:42.278 --> 22:43.654
because you screwed up.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.940
I'm done screwing up.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.940
I'm not gonna get her killed.
Believe me.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.465
I don't see him.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.459
Well, keep looking.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.053
Everybody on the trucks.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.683
What do you want now?

23:12.809 --> 23:15.141
l have reason to believe
that the person responsible

23:15.270 --> 23:17.181
for your daughter's death
is a fireman.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.099
Oh, first it's my family,
and now it's my men?

23:19.232 --> 23:22.190
They're being honored today
for the work they did.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.149
I'm going downtown
to pin medals on their chests.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.564
It's a bad idea.
I need a roster ——

23:25.697 --> 23:27.858
I don't give a damn
if you're still a cop!

23:27.991 --> 23:30.027
You've got no authority in this town.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.621
If it makes you feel any better, I ——

23:36.749 --> 23:39.331
lneverthought
you had any authority.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.796
[Siren wails]

23:45.925 --> 23:48.337
Uh, guys, guys.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.048
I think that's him.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.553
Nice work.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.760
Hey, come here.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.562
This fireman.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.682
—What's his name?
—Don Keaton.

24:03.818 --> 24:04.682
He was a volunteer here,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.605
but he moved away
after what happened to Bill.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.228
He worked with Bill Marigold?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.820
They went
into that building together,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.359
but only Don came out.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.743
Well, how did he survive?

24:12.869 --> 24:15.611
Well, Bill took the upper floor,
got killed when the gas line blew.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.284
Don was downstairs.
A retaining wall shielded him.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.247
Didn't get a scratch on him.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.575
ls Don back in Haven?

24:22.712 --> 24:25.294
Yeah, he's getting a medal today.

24:33.848 --> 24:34.928
Think about the victims,

24:35.058 --> 24:37.470
the cabbie ——
his cab was decked out

24:37.602 --> 24:38.887
in honor of Haven firemen.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.727
The coffee shop ——
you said that the woman

24:41.856 --> 24:44.563
was having a fund—raiser
for families of firefighters, right?

24:44.692 --> 24:46.432
I think when people
congratulate Don,

24:46.569 --> 24:48.935
thank him for his service, it ——

24:49.072 --> 24:50.733
it makes him think
about his partner's death,

24:50.865 --> 24:52.571
and his trouble recreates it.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.281
Why today?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.071
Don just got back to town.

24:56.204 --> 24:58.445
He hasn't had to confront it.
He feels guilty.

24:58.581 --> 25:01.789
But the fire, his partner ——
it wasn't his fault, right?

25:01.918 --> 25:04.204
Guilt doesn't have to be rational.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.293
Don lived.
His partner didn't.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.083
So does he know what he's doing?

25:08.216 --> 25:10.002
Got to believe
he doesn't have any clue

25:10.134 --> 25:12.466
that he's leaving
burned people in his wake.

25:12.595 --> 25:15.302
There must be some kind
of a delayed reaction.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.295
Just out of curiosity,

25:16.432 --> 25:19.924
what happens when a firefighter
whose trouble is activated by guilt

25:20.061 --> 25:23.929
receives an award in front of a crowd
of adoring Haven citizens?

25:26.693 --> 25:30.686
We gotta find him
before he burns the whole town.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.194
Why are you still here?

25:36.327 --> 25:38.943
Fortunately for you,
I'm persistent.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.992
lcantleave.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.456
You're in danger.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.120
Yeah, says the guy
who keeps on insisting

25:45.253 --> 25:46.538
that I'm not who I really am.

25:46.671 --> 25:49.037
—Because you're not.
—And has a gun in his pocket.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.461
You're right.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.395
We good?

26:08.484 --> 26:11.191
I would have preferred
it was still a whole gun.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.981
I'm sorry that I'm upsetting you.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.979
I didn't and don't mean to do that,

26:15.116 --> 26:17.072
but I need you to remember
who you were.

26:17.201 --> 26:20.409
Oh, you mean that ——
that other person

26:20.538 --> 26:23.200
who was in love,
who had an ache in her heart?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.037
Yes.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.873
Okay, see,
that's gonna be a problem

26:26.002 --> 26:28.709
because the only pain that | feel
is you.

26:28.838 --> 26:31.705
My name is Lexie Dewitt.
I'm 31 years old.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.297
l was born in Tucson, Arizona,

26:33.426 --> 26:36.008
and I'm never gonna be drunk enough
or stupid enough

26:36.137 --> 26:37.627
to believe you, all right?

26:37.764 --> 26:40.881
So just take your gun parts
andleave.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.723
Oh, my God.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.356
Whoa.

26:54.489 --> 26:57.652
He's back.
And he's got a friend with him.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.900
I'm trying to get through to you.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.038
They want to stop me,
and this time...

27:04.665 --> 27:06.530
...I think they might.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.081
[Door bells chime]

27:15.510 --> 27:17.250
Do you know what Dwight is doing?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.092
What I told him to do.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.723
but he's out there playing hero.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.594
It's too risky.
You need to mobilize The Guard.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.763
Nathan is doing his job.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.606
What do you want, Jordan?

27:32.735 --> 27:34.350
Do you want to lead The Guard?

27:34.487 --> 27:35.897
No.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.396
I want you to.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.450
Okay, everyone listen up.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.838
Don Keaton's dangerous.
You spot him, don't approach.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.750
Radio me.

27:56.217 --> 27:56.922
No vest?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.667
I'm not worried about bullets today.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.385
You know, if we actually
do find this guy

28:01.514 --> 28:02.629
and explain to him
what he's doing,

28:02.765 --> 28:04.130
he could very well
have a meltdown.

28:04.267 --> 28:04.847
I know.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.512
I mean, you know,
I heard it before I said it,

28:06.644 --> 28:08.134
but, like, literally.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.262
But if he feels guilty
and we're nice to him,

28:10.398 --> 28:11.729
that's bad, too, right?

28:11.858 --> 28:13.894
That's why I'm gonna arrest him
when | find him.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.482
Uh, for what?

28:15.611 --> 28:16.646
I don't know.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.940
Hopefully he won't feel guilty
if he's pissed off.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.779
So your plan is to act like a jerk.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.238
Call me if you see him.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.494
Are you like an auxiliary
police officer up here?

28:31.502 --> 28:32.878
You must still be in shock.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.494
Yeah, probably.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.416
All right, come on.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.967
Dwight, how we gonna spot this guy?

28:49.103 --> 28:51.185
Well, if we see smoke,
then I guess we're too late.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.556
Wait.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.023
There he is.

28:58.362 --> 28:59.568
Let me talk to him.

28:59.697 --> 29:00.857
No. No way.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.651
Guilt is what sets him off,

29:02.783 --> 29:06.025
so we need him feeling
a different emotion —— like anger.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.777
And since that's what everyone feels
when they see me,

29:07.914 --> 29:09.575
might as well use it
to my advantage.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.742
Just trust me.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.334
I know what I'm doing.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.505
I'll try and stop anybody
from going back there,

29:20.635 --> 29:21.920
but there's a lot of people
floating around, okay?

29:22.053 --> 29:24.009
Just be careful.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.010
Head down there
and clear the way up that way, okay?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.353
Head back up
and clear everyone now.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.563
Okay, get the back.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.623
Don Keaton,
l'm Detective Wuornos.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.413
l'm placing you under arrest.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.119
What —— what for?

29:58.255 --> 29:59.916
We'll talk about it at the station.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.755
I need you to come with me now.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.169
—This way.
—Okay.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.508
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:04.637 --> 30:06.798
in 10 minutes
we will celebrate Haven's heroes

30:06.931 --> 30:10.640
with a medal ceremony
for our brave Haven firefighters.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.384
A medal?
I shouldn't get a medal.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.603
—This way, let's go. Hurry.
—What did I do wrong?

30:16.190 --> 30:17.054
Nothing.
You didn't do anything.

30:17.191 --> 30:20.308
Really? You think so?
You think I'm a hero, too?

30:21.696 --> 30:24.859
Well, you're wrong, okay?
Just like the rest of them.

30:27.118 --> 30:29.029
Oh, no.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.795
Nathan found him!

30:42.216 --> 30:44.628
—Yeah.
—That's good, right?

30:44.760 --> 30:45.670
Usually.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.088
There he is.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.428
Hey!
You're not getting by me.

30:49.557 --> 30:50.546
Move, Crocker.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.639
One touch from me,
and Don Keaton's unconscious.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.178
Well, you're not fast enough.

30:54.311 --> 30:55.972
He freaks out
and torches everyone.

30:56.105 --> 30:57.515
Get out of my way.

30:57.648 --> 30:58.637
It's not gonna happen.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.310
Good idea.

31:00.443 --> 31:01.979
Stay in my way.

31:05.322 --> 31:08.655
Shoot a defenseless woman...twice?

31:08.784 --> 31:09.819
Third time's a charm.

31:09.952 --> 31:11.943
Hey, don't push him.
I'm sure he's got good reason.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.495
Right?

31:15.624 --> 31:17.410
Right.

31:18.669 --> 31:20.534
Now you leave Nathan alone.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.544
—What's happening?
—Don, you're troubled.

31:26.677 --> 31:29.919
I know you don't realize
you're doing it, but look.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.685
I'm doing that to you?

31:37.813 --> 31:38.973
I don't believe it.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.348
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

31:42.485 --> 31:45.147
When was the last time
you saw Sally Marigold?

31:45.279 --> 31:47.486
In the sculpture garden.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.526
She asked me to accept Bill's medal.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.489
And that cab driver?

31:51.619 --> 31:54.031
He gave me a free ride.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.575
He told me
heroes don't pay in his cab.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.369
And in the coffee shop,
they congratulated you, right?

31:59.502 --> 32:01.834
The whole place did.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.044
And now they're dead?

32:05.299 --> 32:08.883
It's all my fault,
because of what I did to Bill.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.046
No, Bill was not your fault.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.170
—You keep saying that!
—Because it's true.

32:12.306 --> 32:16.015
Bill was my partner, and he died.
How is that not my fault?

32:28.531 --> 32:33.742
Don, sometimes bad things
just happen to good people,

32:33.869 --> 32:35.325
especially in this town.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.070
But guilt, it's not important.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.664
Doing what's right now is.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.127
I lost my partner, too.

32:45.673 --> 32:48.460
It was horrible,
and it hurts every day.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.459
But our partners wouldn't want us
to make things worse.

32:51.595 --> 32:52.550
They'd want us
to make things better.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.636
That's what Bill would want.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.723
That's all we can do.

33:01.522 --> 33:04.138
I want things to get better.

33:26.797 --> 33:29.288
Just hang tight.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.336
Dwight.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.884
It's okay, Don.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.765
You all right?

33:48.569 --> 33:50.605
Yeah.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.613
Thanks for backing me up.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.161
That was stupid.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.531
You could've died.
Why would you do that?

34:03.667 --> 34:04.827
Because he wants to help people.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.293
Wrong.
He pretends to help people.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.538
But everything he's done was for her.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.507
You pretended to be in love with me.

34:13.636 --> 34:14.967
You destroyed the barn ——

34:15.095 --> 34:17.222
our one chance
at ending the troubles.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.844
You damned us all.

34:21.977 --> 34:22.841
So play the good guy,

34:22.978 --> 34:25.515
but we all know you're only doing it
for one reason ——

34:25.648 --> 34:27.934
Audrey Parker.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.434
I can't wait to see her end you.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.612
Hey.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.238
She's wrong.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.702
You've been helping people
around here

34:41.830 --> 34:44.367
long before Blondie came to town.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.371
We're gonna find her.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.622
If she's still out there,
why hasn't she come back yet?

34:54.134 --> 34:58.002
I tried jails, hospitals,
even morgues.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.880
Maybe Audrey
doesn't know who she is.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.761
We may have to face the fact

35:03.894 --> 35:07.057
that the barn gave her
a new personality

35:07.189 --> 35:09.020
before it spit her out.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.360
Let's go.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.071
Make a scene,
and we hurt her.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.065
The cops are already on their way.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.568
I don't want to put a bullet
in your head, too.

35:23.664 --> 35:26.201
Okay, look, l'll —— I'll go.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.915
She still thinks
she's a bartender, so...

35:30.629 --> 35:32.711
Sorry I couldn't help.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.133
Anybody?

35:38.262 --> 35:40.253
They're gonna kill this guy.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.095
You ——

36:10.210 --> 36:11.620
Let him go.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.132
Put it down.

36:21.430 --> 36:24.593
Get out of my bar.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.684
Out!

36:51.293 --> 36:52.874
How did I do that?

36:54.129 --> 36:55.960
Still think you're a bartender?

37:24.493 --> 37:26.279
That was pretty crazy
what you did back there.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.572
Hmm.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.240
I hope I'm not hurting you.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.534
No, I don't feel it.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.162
I don't feel anything.

37:36.213 --> 37:37.749
That's my trouble.

37:38.507 --> 37:39.713
You're troubled?

37:39.842 --> 37:41.332
Yeah.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.384
You're the boy
that Duke told me about

37:44.513 --> 37:45.878
who broke his arm sledding.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.301
—l'm sorry.
—Don't be.

37:54.022 --> 37:54.772
if I was normal,

37:54.898 --> 37:58.607
then I wouldn't have been able
to help out Don back there.

37:59.570 --> 38:03.438
Well, then I guess I'm glad
I'm not normal either.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.868
You're celebrating Founder's Day?

38:18.714 --> 38:20.079
Founder's, yeah.

38:20.215 --> 38:24.083
Found her nailing my contractor!

38:24.219 --> 38:27.427
Well, that's good.
You've started the healing process.

38:27.556 --> 38:31.765
Listen, lam really glad
that I'm here.

38:31.894 --> 38:33.600
Is that right?

38:33.729 --> 38:35.640
No, I mean,
I used to come visit you

38:35.772 --> 38:36.978
when we were kids, you know,

38:37.107 --> 38:39.098
but we never really got
to know each other, all right?

38:39.234 --> 38:41.611
Dad always made it a competition.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.648
But you won. Okay?

38:43.780 --> 38:45.736
l was always my mom's kid.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.822
But Dad loved you.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.452
You...

38:49.578 --> 38:51.739
You were his.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.165
You all caught up?

38:59.505 --> 39:03.123
Wade, trust me, you won.

39:03.258 --> 39:06.625
No, no, no, we're gonna show people
what's what, okay?

39:06.762 --> 39:07.626
You and me.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.755
The Crocker brothers ride again.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.301
You are very drunk.

39:12.434 --> 39:15.392
No, lam serious, okay?

39:15.521 --> 39:16.510
The lawyer called.

39:16.647 --> 39:18.763
Filing for the divorce
is gonna take a while,

39:18.899 --> 39:20.480
so I'm gonna take you up
on your offer

39:20.609 --> 39:22.895
and I'm gonna stay in Haven.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.360
No, Wade,
that wasn't really an offer.

39:27.950 --> 39:30.282
To my little brother,
Duke Crocker.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.537
[All cheer]

39:32.663 --> 39:37.157
He's taken me in,
given me a home right here.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.499
Next round's on me.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.290
[Cheers]

39:43.924 --> 39:48.167
Looks like your brother's still
enjoying his time here in Haven.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.154
Hey.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.871
The day | first started
hearing voices,

40:21.003 --> 40:22.709
your voice...

40:24.047 --> 40:26.504
...it was the most frightened
I had ever been in my life.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.375
I felt like a fish who'd just
been yanked out of the water.

40:29.511 --> 40:34.005
Crazy, nuts, and powerless.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.224
I don't want to feel that way again.

40:39.396 --> 40:44.936
But today I really understood
how important Audrey is

40:45.068 --> 40:48.060
and why Haven needs her so badly.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.609
If I can remember anything
that will help bring her back...

40:57.873 --> 40:59.909
You know, you didn't have to actually
just throw those away.

41:00.042 --> 41:03.751
You could've just given them to me
for recreational purposes.

41:05.047 --> 41:07.789
You're the one who keeps saying
I'm not crazy.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.300
l'm troubled.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.708
You are.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.629
And troubled we can fix.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.891
Usually.

41:28.236 --> 41:29.146
See?

41:29.279 --> 41:30.860
You're not just a bartender,

41:30.989 --> 41:33.605
and that wasn't a Cosmo
you whipped up.

41:33.742 --> 41:35.278
That was a SlG Pro semiautomatic,

41:35.410 --> 41:37.947
and you assembled it
in under 10 seconds.

41:39.206 --> 41:40.821
Which is why it's time
for you to tell me

41:40.957 --> 41:42.458
who you think I really am.

41:42.584 --> 41:45.291
Who I know you are.

41:46.505 --> 41:51.090
But if I tell you,
there's no going back.
