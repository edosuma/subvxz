WEBVTT

00:23.291 --> 00:25.667
I DON'T RECALL
REQUESTING THE PLEASURE
OF YOUR COMPANY, PACEY.

00:25.667 --> 00:26.625
RAG?

00:26.625 --> 00:27.625
BRUSH.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.542
YOU KNOW,

00:29.542 --> 00:32.208
AFTER VAN GOGH
CHOPPED OFF
HIS OWN EAR,

00:32.208 --> 00:34.208
THERE WAS A RASH
OF COPYCAT
MUTILATIONS

00:34.208 --> 00:35.542
AMONGST
HIS STUDENTS.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.166
YOUR POINT BEING...

00:38.166 --> 00:39.834
WELL, MY POINT BEING

00:39.834 --> 00:41.708
THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
REVERES THE ARTIST,

00:41.708 --> 00:44.208
ENVIES THEIR TALENT,
WANTS TO BE JUST
LIKE THEM.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.625
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING HERE.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.834
I'M HOPING
SOME OF YOUR GENIUS
WILL RUB OFF ON ME.

00:47.834 --> 00:48.917
YOU GOT KICKED OUT
OF YOUR HOUSE AGAIN.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.333
NO. NOT EXACTLY
KICKED OUT.
IT'S MORE LIKE

00:51.333 --> 00:53.041
THEY'RE FILMING
A LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIE

00:53.041 --> 00:54.125
IN MY LIVING ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.542
AND WHICH ONE
OF THE WITTER SISTERS

00:56.542 --> 00:59.542
IS IN COMPLETE DISTRESS
RIGHT NOW?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.208
THAT WOULD BE
NUMERO UNO.

01:01.208 --> 01:03.208
LEFT THE SERGEANT
MAJOR FOR CONDUCT
UNBECOMING,

01:03.208 --> 01:04.417
FLED BACK
TO THE HOME FRONT,

01:04.417 --> 01:05.583
AND, OF COURSE,
BROUGHT ALONG
MY SCREAMING NIECES.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.542
OH.

01:07.542 --> 01:08.875
SO I FINALLY GET MY OWN ROOM,

01:08.875 --> 01:11.583
AND YOU HAVE BEEN EXILED
TO SOFA CITY.

01:11.583 --> 01:12.959
OUCH.

01:12.959 --> 01:15.041
MY SENTIMENTS
EXACTLY.

01:16.959 --> 01:19.083
SO, UH...

01:19.083 --> 01:21.375
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:23.583 --> 01:24.708
OH, IS IT DONE?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.000
YES, IT'S DONE.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.291
I THOUGHT
THAT PRINCIPAL GREEN

01:28.291 --> 01:30.041
HAD COMMISSIONED YOU GUYS
TO DO MURALS

01:30.041 --> 01:32.583
EXEMPLIFYING
SCHOOL SPIRIT AND UNITY.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.083
HE DID.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.959
OH.

01:36.959 --> 01:39.583
WELL...NO OFFENSE,
BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE SOMETHING

01:39.583 --> 01:43.125
YOU'D FIND TATTOOED
ON KWAI CHANG CAINE'S
FOREHEAD.

01:43.834 --> 01:45.291
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.250
I DIDN'T SAY
I DON'T LIKE IT.
I'M...

01:47.250 --> 01:49.417
PRETTY SURE THE REST
OF THE MURALS

01:49.417 --> 01:52.208
WILL PROBABLY
BE A LITTLE MORE
TRADITIONAL, BUT--

01:52.208 --> 01:53.750
WHAT, LIKE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
AND LIGHTHOUSES?

01:53.750 --> 01:57.208
AND WHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY
SAY ABOUT THE HIGH SCHOOL
EXPERIENCE?

01:57.208 --> 01:59.083
JOE, THIS IS
THE U.S. OF A.

01:59.083 --> 02:00.291
WE'RE A VERY PROSAIC
NATION,

02:00.291 --> 02:02.583
AND WHEN WE HAVE ART
IN PUBLIC PLACES,

02:02.583 --> 02:04.500
WE WANT IT TO BE
ABOUT AS SUBTLE
AS GODZILLA.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.750
YEAH, BUT, PACEY,
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
ART CAN HAVE THIS POWER?

02:07.750 --> 02:09.000
I MEAN, IT CAN BRING
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.625
OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

02:11.625 --> 02:12.917
IN MUSEUMS,

02:12.917 --> 02:14.458
THE THINKING MAN'S
PICKUP JOINT.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.917
AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU, PACEY.

02:17.917 --> 02:21.208
YOU JUST...GO SO DEEP.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.834
THANKS.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.542
NO PEEKING.

03:30.542 --> 03:31.708
WHAT, I DON'T GET
A PREVIEW?

03:31.708 --> 03:32.291
NO.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.750
WHY NOT? PACEY DID.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.500
DAWSON, THE UNVEILING
IS A CRUCIAL PART
TO ANY NEW WORK,

03:37.500 --> 03:40.333
AND...I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.542
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS, DID HE?

03:42.542 --> 03:44.208
NO. HE DIDN'T.
BUT HE SAID
IT WAS GREAT.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.375
THAT MEANS A LOT,
COMING FROM

03:46.375 --> 03:49.417
THE WORLD'S
MOST DISCRIMINATING
ART CRITIC.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.208
HEY. WELL, HE...
HE KNOWS WHAT HE LIKES.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.583
DAWSON, PACEY'S
PRIZED POSSESSION

03:54.583 --> 03:57.625
IS A BLACK
VELVET PAINTING
OF THE BABY ELVIS.

03:57.625 --> 03:58.917
NO.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.875
SO HOW'S
YOUR SPEECH COMING?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.542
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I HAVE TO EVEN SAY
ANYTHING. I MEAN,

04:04.542 --> 04:06.458
ISN'T AN ARTIST
JUST SUPPOSED
TO LET HER WORK

04:06.458 --> 04:07.458
SPEAK FOR ITSELF?

04:07.458 --> 04:09.166
YEAH, BUT WHEN PTAs
AND THE SCHOOL BOARD

04:09.166 --> 04:11.875
LET YOU PAINT
SOMETHING IN THE HALLWAY
OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL,

04:11.875 --> 04:13.125
THEY EXPECT A LITTLE
POIGNANT CEREMONY IN RETURN.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.834
SO ARE YOU
GONNA BE THERE?

04:16.834 --> 04:17.583
OF COURSE!

04:17.583 --> 04:19.375
I MEAN,
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

04:19.375 --> 04:19.959
YEAH.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.750
I WANT YOU TO.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.917
OK.

04:22.917 --> 04:23.875
AND WHATEVER
YOU THINK,

04:23.875 --> 04:25.000
BE HONEST
WITH ME,
YOU KNOW.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.583
EVEN IF
YOU HATE IT--

04:26.583 --> 04:30.041
EVEN IF I HATE--
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M GONNA HATE IT?

04:30.041 --> 04:30.750
NOTHING.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.333
IT'S JUST...

04:32.333 --> 04:35.792
THE STEPPING OUT
FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN?

04:37.166 --> 04:38.625
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT CAN BE TERRIFYING.

04:38.625 --> 04:42.291
UP THERE IN THE LIGHTS
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.458
BEING JUDGED.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.750
WELL, IT'S EVEN MORE
THAN THAT. I MEAN...

04:46.750 --> 04:47.917
I FEEL LIKE I'M...

04:47.917 --> 04:51.291
DECLARING MYSELF
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
I MEAN...

04:51.291 --> 04:54.000
WHAT I REALLY THINK
ABOUT THIS PLACE,
AND...

04:54.000 --> 04:55.583
WITH EVERYONE
STARING AT IT,

04:55.583 --> 04:58.583
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING
RIGHT INTO MY SOUL.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.625
GIVE ME A BREAK.
IT WAS A JOKE.

05:01.625 --> 05:05.708
THERE'S NOTHING
FUNNY ABOUT
CHEATING, MATT.

05:05.708 --> 05:06.708
PRINCIPAL GREEN...

05:06.708 --> 05:09.959
MEMBERS OF THE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE...

05:09.959 --> 05:11.458
I--I ADMIT IT.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.708
I--I DIDN'T KNOW
THE ANSWER ON THE QUIZ,

05:13.708 --> 05:16.291
SO--SO I DID WHAT
ANY SELF-RESPECTING KID
WOULD DO

05:16.291 --> 05:18.208
IN THE CELLULAR AGE,
YOU KNOW?

05:18.208 --> 05:20.625
I WHIPPED OUT MY STARTAC,
I DIALED HOME,

05:20.625 --> 05:21.917
AND--AND I ASKED MY MOM,

05:21.917 --> 05:23.291
"HOW MANY JUSTICES SIT
ON THE SUPREME COURT?"

05:23.291 --> 05:26.458
YOU KNOW, CALL ME CRAZY,
YOU KNOW--

05:26.458 --> 05:27.166
EVEN MR. HIGGINS LAUGHED.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.458
McPhee: OK, AND YOU CLAIM

05:29.458 --> 05:32.417
THAT YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T
KNOW THE ANSWER EITHER?

05:32.417 --> 05:33.000
UH-HUH.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.792
OK. SO...

05:36.792 --> 05:38.959
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
YOUR PERFECT SCORE
ON THE QUIZ?

05:38.959 --> 05:40.583
I GUESSED.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.166
OK. UM, WELL,

05:46.166 --> 05:47.750
THEN I GUESS
MY RECOMMENDATION
WOULD BE

05:47.750 --> 05:53.000
THAT YOU GET A FAILING GRADE
ON THE WORK IN QUESTION

05:53.000 --> 05:54.500
AND A 3-HOUR DETENTION.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.166
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
BUST MY KNEECAPS
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

05:57.166 --> 05:58.458
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH,
MR. CAUFIELD.

05:58.458 --> 06:02.000
WHILE YOUR BEHAVIOR
CLEARLY VIOLATES

06:02.000 --> 06:03.166
THE LETTER OF
THE HONOR CODE,

06:03.166 --> 06:06.291
I DO NOT BELIEVE
IT IS IN VIOLATION
OF THE SPIRIT.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.417
AM I FREE
TO GO THEN?

06:09.417 --> 06:10.625
YES, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.333
MR. CAUFIELD.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.917
LET'S LET THIS
BE THE LAST TIME

06:15.917 --> 06:17.667
WE SEE YOU
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.041
Green: UH, ANDIE...

06:33.041 --> 06:34.000
WOULD YOU WAIT
FOR ME FOR A MINUTE,
PLEASE?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.500
SURE.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.708
UM, PRINCIPAL GREEN,

06:42.708 --> 06:44.166
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT EARLIER.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.041
I OVERREACTED
TO THE--

06:45.041 --> 06:47.708
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.417
ANDIE, I HAVE NEWS.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.041
NEWS?
[FORCES LAUGH]

06:51.041 --> 06:52.291
I WAS CONTACTED
THIS MORNING

06:52.291 --> 06:55.458
BY THE EDUCATIONAL
TESTING SERVICE.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.667
ANDIE...

06:56.667 --> 06:58.083
YOUR PHENOMENAL
PSAT RESULTS

06:58.083 --> 07:02.667
HAVE PLACED YOU AMONG
THE TOP 50,000 SCORERS
IN THE COUNTRY.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.166
YOU, YOUNG LADY,
HAVE TAKEN ONE GIANT STEP

07:05.166 --> 07:07.291
TOWARD A NATIONAL
MERIT SCHOLARSHIP.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.708
ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC?

07:11.125 --> 07:12.208
FANTASTIC.

07:12.208 --> 07:15.417
ANDIE, WHAT'S WRONG?

07:15.417 --> 07:15.708
YOU SEEM STUNNED.

07:17.834 --> 07:18.375
NO. NO, NO.

07:18.375 --> 07:21.250
IT'S JUST, UM...

07:21.250 --> 07:23.250
WELL, IT'S JUST--
YEAH...

07:23.250 --> 07:26.208
I'M A LITTLE
STUNNED.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.625
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:45.417 --> 07:46.458
NO. NO.

07:46.458 --> 07:47.333
NO! LOOK!

07:47.333 --> 07:48.625
PACEY, LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE,

07:48.625 --> 07:50.208
YOU LEFT WATER
RINGS ON MY DECO
COFFEE TABLE.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.959
DOUGIE, MOM AND DAD
JUST WANTED ME TO BRING
YOU SOMETHING, THAT'S ALL.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.291
YEAH? WHAT?

07:56.542 --> 07:58.250
ME!

07:58.250 --> 07:59.792
LOOK, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

07:59.792 --> 08:01.875
I'M MOVING IN, BRO.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.083
WH--EXCUSE ME?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.208
YOU HEARD ME.
I'M MOVING IN.

08:04.208 --> 08:06.125
OH, LOOK, DAD GAVE ME
A CHECK TO GIVE TO YOU,

08:06.125 --> 08:06.959
IT'S, UH, LIKE
A SECURITY DEPOSIT

08:06.959 --> 08:08.500
IN CASE I BREAK
YOUR STEREO.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.959
YOU'RE NOT BREAKING
MY STEREO, BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT TOUCHING MY STEREO,

08:10.959 --> 08:13.291
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
MOVING IN WITH ME.
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.834
THIS IS NOT PARTY OF FIVE.

08:15.834 --> 08:16.917
COME ON, DOUGIE,
PLEASE.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.417
YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME GO BACK
TO THAT HOUSE.

08:18.417 --> 08:19.375
I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.166
YOU GOT THIS WHOLE
STYLIN' BACHELOR PAD

08:21.166 --> 08:23.417
ALL TO YOURSELF
WITH THE...
NICE LIGHTING

08:23.417 --> 08:25.166
AND THE FANCY
WINDOW DRESSINGS

08:25.166 --> 08:26.333
AND ALL
THE OTHER TRAPPINGS

08:26.333 --> 08:29.083
OF THE MODERN
EXTREMELY CLOSETED
HOMOSEXUAL MALE,

08:29.083 --> 08:31.792
AND I DON'T
EVEN HAVE A ROOM
TO MYSELF ANYMORE.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.375
[SIGHS] SINCE WHEN?

08:33.375 --> 08:34.833
WELL, SINCE CARRIE
DECIDED TO TAKE

08:34.833 --> 08:36.667
AN EXTENDED LEAVE OF
ABSENCE FROM JERRY.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.166
YOU REMEMBER JERRY,
DON'T YOU?

08:38.166 --> 08:38.958
OUR FAVORITE
BROTHER-IN-LAW,

08:38.958 --> 08:40.750
THE ONE WITH
ALL THE TATTOOS?

08:40.750 --> 08:42.667
AND OF COURSE
SHE BROUGHT ALONG
THE NO-NECK MONSTERS

08:42.667 --> 08:44.959
WHO ARE CURRENTLY
RESIDING IN MY ROOM.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.333
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MAN?

08:46.333 --> 08:48.542
CAN I STAY HERE,
PLEASE?

08:50.959 --> 08:51.625
OK, LOOK,

08:51.625 --> 08:53.583
IF  I AGREE TO THIS--

08:53.583 --> 08:55.417
AND IT IS A VERY BIG "IF"--

08:55.417 --> 08:57.000
THERE WILL BE RULES.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.375
I AM YOUR WILLING PUPIL.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.083
RULE NUMBER ONE:
WE DON'T EAT ANYTHING
THAT MOM SENDS OVER.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.625
THE WOMAN THINKS
THAT ICEBERG LETTUCE
IS HAUTE CUISINE.

09:04.625 --> 09:05.542
AGREED.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.417
RULE NUMBER 2:
THE COASTER.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.125
LIVE IT, LOVE IT,
USE IT AT ALL TIMES.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.250
DONE.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.667
YOU WILL KEEP
THE CD COLLECTION

09:12.667 --> 09:15.417
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER
BY LAST NAME, NOT FIRST.

09:15.417 --> 09:16.750
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:16.750 --> 09:19.542
OH, YEAH, PERFECTLY.
BUT I DON'T FORESEE
THE NEED FOR ME

09:19.542 --> 09:21.959
TO DIP INTO
YOUR DIVA COLLECTION
ANYTIME TOO SOON.

09:21.959 --> 09:23.834
OH, I THINK
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED

09:23.834 --> 09:26.417
AT HOW A TORTURED,
IMPASSIONED FEMALE VOICE

09:26.417 --> 09:28.583
CAN SOOTHE
AN ACHY-BREAKY HEART.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.250
MY HEART IS JUST FINE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.375
OH, SURE IT IS,
LITTLE BROTHER.
SURE IT IS.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.583
LOOK, DOUGIE,
IF YOU'RE REFERRING

09:33.583 --> 09:35.959
TO OUR BRIEF
JAILHOUSE CONVERSATION
THE OTHER NIGHT,

09:35.959 --> 09:37.041
YOU CAN JUST CHALK IT UP
TO DRUNKEN RAMBLING.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.041
WELL, THERE WON'T BE ANY
OF THAT ON MY WATCH.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.708
AND I WON'T HAVE
ANY MOPING AROUND

09:41.708 --> 09:43.875
LIKE A LOVESICK PUPPY
EITHER.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.166
BY THE WAY,

09:45.166 --> 09:46.708
ARE YOU ANY GOOD
AT DECOUPAGE?

09:46.708 --> 09:48.750
OH, GOD HELP ME...

10:03.000 --> 10:05.041
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
ON TAKING PICTURES?

10:05.041 --> 10:06.875
UH, DON'T TRY
AND STOP HER, JOEY.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.291
WHEN A LITTLE SISTER
ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING
IMPRESSIVE,

10:09.291 --> 10:10.834
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR A BIG SISTER

10:10.834 --> 10:13.083
TO CREATE A HUGE,
EMBARRASSING FUSS
OVER HER.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.125
YEAH, AND THE MORE
EMBARRASSING,
THE BETTER.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.083
THANK YOU.
I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA
BE TOO FUN FOR YOU

10:17.083 --> 10:18.750
TO WALK THE HALLS
OF CAPESIDE AGAIN,

10:18.750 --> 10:20.959
SEEING AS IT WASN'T
EXACTLY YOUR FAVORITE
PLACE ON EARTH.

10:20.959 --> 10:22.375
YEAH, BUT I'M OLD,
REMEMBER?

10:22.375 --> 10:23.583
AND THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO,

10:23.583 --> 10:24.959
AND THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.041
THEY'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT.
WHAT, ARE THERE, LIKE,

10:27.041 --> 10:28.834
10 BLACK KIDS
IN THAT SCHOOL?

10:28.834 --> 10:30.417
11.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.208
AND DON'T TRY TO REWRITE
HISTORY, BESS. I MEAN...

10:32.208 --> 10:34.625
I REMEMBER THE DAYS
YOU USED TO PICK ME UP
FROM KINDERGARTEN

10:34.625 --> 10:36.792
AND COMPLAIN THE WHOLE WAY
HOME ABOUT SOME...

10:36.792 --> 10:38.959
SMUG, 2-FACED IDIOTS
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE
BETTER THAN YOU

10:38.959 --> 10:40.291
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAD
THE WRONG KIND OF JEANS.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.625
OK, I ADMIT IT.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.667
I HATED HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT THAT'S WHY
I'M SO GLAD

10:43.667 --> 10:46.250
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
FOR YOU, JOEY.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.458
YOU'RE TALENTED,

10:47.458 --> 10:48.917
AND EVERYBODY
AT THAT SCHOOL
KNOWS IT,

10:48.917 --> 10:50.708
THEY'VE KNOWN IT
FOR YEARS,

10:50.708 --> 10:52.708
AND TODAY
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE
PROOF POSITIVE

10:52.708 --> 10:53.625
THAT JOEY POTTER

10:53.625 --> 10:55.917
IS A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

11:04.417 --> 11:05.959
...AND I PAINTED THIS

11:05.959 --> 11:07.834
SO THAT WE ALL CAN REMEMBER
THE BEACON OF KNOWLEDGE

11:07.834 --> 11:10.959
THAT OUR TEACHERS
SHINE ON US EVERY DAY.

11:10.959 --> 11:15.625
IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE
TO THANK PRINCIPAL GREEN

11:15.625 --> 11:19.875
AND ALL OF YOU FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPART
MY MESSAGE OF UNITY.

11:19.875 --> 11:23.667
AND NOW, THE LAST OF
OUR CAPESIDE HIGH MURALS.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.000
I'D LIKE TO ASK
JOEY POTTER TO STEP UP

11:25.000 --> 11:29.750
AND GRACE US WITH A FEW WORDS
ABOUT HER CREATION.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.792
WELL, UH, PRINCIPAL GREEN
SAID THE MURAL SHOULD FOCUS

11:36.792 --> 11:39.959
ON WHAT UNIFIES US
AS A SCHOOL, AND...

11:39.959 --> 11:43.500
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
NOTHING REALLY UNIFIES US.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.375
EVEN OUR MASCOT
IS DIVISIVE--
THE MINUTEMAN?

11:47.375 --> 11:50.208
RIGHT THERE,
YOU'VE ALIENATED HALF
THE STUDENT POPULATION.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.375
[LAUGHTER]

11:52.375 --> 11:54.875
SO...THE ONLY THING
THAT I COULD THINK OF

11:54.875 --> 11:59.041
THAT UNITES US ALL--
THAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON--

11:59.041 --> 12:02.542
IS THAT WE ALL START OFF
IN KINDERGARTEN THINKING

12:02.542 --> 12:04.291
THAT WE CAN BE ANYTHING
THAT WE WANNA BE,

12:04.291 --> 12:09.208
AND BY THE TIME WE GET HERE,
WE'VE SOMEHOW LOST THAT FEELING.

12:09.208 --> 12:14.125
WE'VE ALL STARTED TO BELIEVE
WHATEVER OUR PARENTS OR
OUR FRIENDS HAVE TOLD US

12:14.125 --> 12:16.792
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE
AND WHO WE CAN BE IN LIFE,

12:16.792 --> 12:20.875
AND WE'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THAT POSSIBILITY WE HAD
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.

12:20.875 --> 12:24.500
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK
WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON,

12:24.500 --> 12:27.583
AND THAT'S WHAT THE SYMBOL
ON MY PAINTING MEANS--

12:27.583 --> 12:31.708
POSSIBILITY.
I PAINTED IT BECAUSE
I THOUGHT WE COULD ALL USE

12:31.708 --> 12:35.083
A DAILY REMINDER
THAT IF YOU BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF,

12:35.083 --> 12:38.875
EVEN WHEN THE ODDS
SEEM STACKED AGAINST YOU,
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.750
SO, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.208
[MUTED GASPS AND COMMENTS]

13:03.417 --> 13:03.875
EXCUSE ME.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.583
JOEY.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.333
HEY, WAIT UP.
YOU OK?

13:24.333 --> 13:26.708
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR ANSWERING THE CALL
TO PUBLIC SERVICE--

13:26.708 --> 13:28.458
PUBLIC HUMILIATION.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.792
NOBODY'S HUMILIATED EXCEPT FOR
MAYBE THE PERSON WHO DID THIS.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.375
IT FELT HUMILIATING,
DAWSON, TO ME.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.458
LOOK, IT WAS
A SILLY PRANK.

13:33.458 --> 13:34.458
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.333
YOU PUT YOUR HEART
AND SOUL INTO THAT,

13:36.333 --> 13:38.125
AND I DON'T BLAME
YOU FOR BEING ANGRY,
BUT DON'T TURN THIS

13:38.125 --> 13:41.083
INTO SOME SORT OF
PERSONAL ATTACK
ON YOU.

13:41.083 --> 13:44.333
NOT TO STICK MY NOSE
IN HERE, BUT JUST
TO STICK MY NOSE IN,

13:44.333 --> 13:46.625
OF COURSE IT WAS
A PERSONAL ATTACK.
WHAT?

13:46.625 --> 13:48.625
THERE WERE ONLY 3 MURALS
IN THAT HALLWAY.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.208
YOURS WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT GOT TOUCHED.
SO?

13:51.208 --> 13:52.917
SO EITHER SOMEONE
DIDN'T LIKE WHAT JOEY
WAS TRYING TO SAY,

13:52.917 --> 13:55.291
OR SOMEONE JUST
DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.917
YOUR LOGIC LEAVES
A LOT TO BE DESIRED.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.125
DAWSON, WE'RE IN
HIGH SCHOOL HERE.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.667
IT'S A VERITABLE SOCIETY
UNTO ITS OWN

14:00.667 --> 14:03.166
WITH A PECKING ORDER THAT
MAKES THE CASTE SYSTEM
LOOK FORGIVING.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.083
WHO KNOWS WHAT SUBTLE LINE
YOU MAY HAVE CROSSED

14:05.083 --> 14:07.250
OR WHAT OFFENSE YOU MIGHT
HAVE GIVEN WITHOUT
KNOWING IT?

14:07.250 --> 14:08.333
PARANOID MUCH?

14:08.333 --> 14:09.959
YOU DON'T THINK
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT
THERE WHO HATES JOEY
JUST FOR BEING JOEY?

14:12.333 --> 14:14.166
WHO HATES THE WAY SHE TALKS,
THE WAY SHE DRESSES,

14:14.166 --> 14:15.667
THE WAY SHE CHEWS
ON HER LOWER LIP.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.834
I DON'T CHEW
ON MY LOWER LIP!

14:17.834 --> 14:19.375
I'M JUST PUTTING
IT OUT THERE.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.208
THINK ABOUT IT.
DOES ANYBODY COME TO MIND?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.959
WHY, SO WE CAN ALL
GANG UP ON HIM AND
CALL HIM DIRTY NAMES?

14:23.959 --> 14:25.750
DO ME A FAVOR,
JUST STAY OUT OF THIS.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.166
IT WAS AN ACT
OF VANDALISM,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.000
SOME IDIOT TRYING
TO RAGE AGAINST
THE MACHINE.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.333
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
PERFECT!

14:31.333 --> 14:33.333
HECKLE AND JECKLE.
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT A GIRL NEEDS

14:33.333 --> 14:36.875
IN THE MIDDLE OF
AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS,
AND IT'S NOT HELPING.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.959
SO THANKS,
BUT NO, THANKS.

14:40.875 --> 14:44.166
SHOULDN'T WE, UH--
NO. LET HER GO.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.291
[SIGHS]

14:47.291 --> 14:49.917
SO, UH, HAVE YOU HEARD
ANY WORD ON JOEY?

14:49.917 --> 14:52.250
SHE'S PRETTY
BROKEN UP ABOUT IT.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.542
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.
WHO WOULDN'T BE?

14:53.542 --> 14:57.208
THEY'LL CATCH THE GUY,
AND YOU CAN HAVE
THE LAST LAUGH.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.708
HUH?

14:58.708 --> 14:59.708
D.C. THROW
THE BOOK AT HIM.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.375
RIGHT, HEH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:02.375 --> 15:05.542
ACTUALLY, JACK,
I'M THINKING ABOUT
QUITTING MY POSITION.

15:05.542 --> 15:06.917
ON THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE?

15:06.917 --> 15:11.000
ANDIE, YOU'RE, LIKE,
THE SENIOR-MOST STUDENT
REPRESENTATIVE.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.125
THAT'S ONE STEP BELOW
THE SAVIOR FOR MANKIND

15:13.125 --> 15:15.375
AS FAR AS
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS
ARE CONCERNED.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.208
I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST
TAKING UP WAY TOO MUCH TIME.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.417
BESIDES, MY SCHOOL WORK'S
STARTING TO SLIP,

15:19.417 --> 15:23.542
AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE UNCOMFORTABLE I FEEL

15:23.542 --> 15:26.208
ABOUT SITTING IN JUDGMENT
OF OTHERS.

15:28.083 --> 15:28.875
WHAT?

15:28.875 --> 15:32.959
I'M JUST
A LITTLE SHOCKED.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.542
WHY?

15:34.542 --> 15:38.041
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO BAIL ON
A COMMITMENT.

15:38.041 --> 15:41.291
COME ON, JACK.
A LOT OF THINGS
AREN'T LIKE  ME,

15:41.291 --> 15:43.333
BUT I'VE DONE
THEM ANYWAY.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.667
CAN YOU SET THE TABLE?

15:47.667 --> 15:49.041
YEAH.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.750
[DING DING]

16:10.750 --> 16:12.291
ANY ROOM AT THE INN?

16:12.291 --> 16:13.667
DEPENDS.

16:13.667 --> 16:14.417
ON WHAT?

16:14.417 --> 16:16.000
THE LENGTH
OF THE LECTURE

16:16.000 --> 16:17.542
I'M GONNA BE FORCED
TO SIT THROUGH.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.542
NO LECTURES, I PROMISE.

16:19.542 --> 16:20.667
ALTHOUGH I DO WANNA SAY

16:20.667 --> 16:25.500
THAT I'M SORRY THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY HAPPENED.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.500
WELL, THE WHOLE THING
WAS TRAGICALLY LAME
TO BEGIN WITH.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.125
AS IF PAINTING
ON A WALL IS GOING
TO MAKE ANY CHANGE

16:32.125 --> 16:34.750
OR THE SLIGHTEST BIT
OF DIFFERENCE IN SCHOOL.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.417
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.417
FOR SOME REASON,
I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND
OF THOSE MAYBES.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.208
REPAINT THE MURAL.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.625
WHAT?

16:45.625 --> 16:47.166
DO IT TONIGHT.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.583
SURPRISE THAT BASTARD
WHEN HE SHOWS UP
TOMORROW MORNING.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.834
I WOULD RATHER SHOVE
RED-HOT NEEDLES

16:50.834 --> 16:53.250
UNDERNEATH
MY TOENAILS, OK?

16:53.250 --> 16:54.708
COME ON. YOU'RE
GONNA LET SOME STUPID
HIGH SCHOOL PRANK

16:54.708 --> 16:58.500
KEEP YOU FROM FINISHING
SOMETHING THAT YOU
OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.166
I FINISHED IT,
DAWSON, OK?

17:00.166 --> 17:03.917
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT NOT EVERYBODY GOT
A CHANCE TO SEE IT.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BEING LIKE THIS.
LIKE WHAT?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
DEFEATED. DEJECTED.
DEMORALIZED.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.625
NEWS FLASH, DAWSON:
I CAN'T ALWAYS BE

17:10.625 --> 17:12.000
YOUR PLUCKY
LITTLE JOEY POTTER.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.500
I DON'T HAVE THIS
UNLIMITED RESERVE

17:13.500 --> 17:15.083
OF GOODWILL AND
GOOD FAITH IN HUMANITY,

17:15.083 --> 17:17.500
AND SOMETIMES,
I AM GOING TO BE
A LITTLE DEPRESSED.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.791
IT'S NOT ABOUT DEMEANOR.
IT'S ABOUT NOT BEING A VICTIM.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.333
IT TOOK ME A MONTH
TO DO THAT, DAWSON.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.125
I HAD TO CONCEIVE IT,
AND I HAD TO EXECUTE IT,

17:25.125 --> 17:27.375
AND YOU CAN'T JUST
EXPECT ME TO START OVER.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.875
WHY NOT?

17:28.875 --> 17:32.500
FOR THE SAME REASON
YOU HAVEN'T SHOT A ROLL
OF FILM SINCE JANUARY.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.750
JOEY, THAT'S
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.417
REALLY?
YES.

17:35.417 --> 17:39.250
I CHOSE TO QUIT FILMMAKING.
THAT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.041
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT

17:41.041 --> 17:43.458
THAT IT
WAS POORLY RECEIVED
AT THE FESTIVAL?

17:43.458 --> 17:44.667
TRUTHFULLY? NO.

17:47.166 --> 17:51.333
WELL...THEN HOW
CONVENIENT FOR YOU.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.917
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:54.375 --> 17:56.708
YOU HAVE ALL OF
THESE CHOICES, DAWSON.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.208
YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE
CHOICES THAT YOU JUST
TAKE FOR GRANTED.

18:00.208 --> 18:04.000
I MEAN...GOD...
ONE DAY, YOU'RE
A FILMMAKER,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.583
AND THE NEXT DAY,
YOU'RE NOT,
AND TOMORROW,

18:05.583 --> 18:08.250
YOU COULD WAKE UP
AND DECIDE YOU WANTED
TO BE A SCULPTOR,

18:08.250 --> 18:11.792
OR YOU WANTED TO JUST
BACKPACK THROUGH EUROPE,

18:11.792 --> 18:13.917
OR--OR--OR CLIMB
MT. EVEREST,
AND YOU CAN DO THAT.

18:13.917 --> 18:16.208
AND YOU CAN'T?
NO, I CAN'T.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.083
WHY NOT?

18:17.083 --> 18:19.000
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO WASTE THE TIME

18:19.000 --> 18:21.083
TO GO FIND MYSELF
AND BE ARTISTIC,

18:21.083 --> 18:23.166
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO JUST REJECT REALITY

18:23.166 --> 18:24.875
AND GO OFF AND CHASE
MY PIPE DREAMS.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.083
I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE
THAT'S NOT MY LIFE.
THAT'S YOUR LIFE.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.166
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
THIS IS ABOUT?

18:29.166 --> 18:30.417
WHAT?

18:30.417 --> 18:32.333
I THINK YOU'RE RELIEVED.

18:32.333 --> 18:37.792
I THINK YOU'RE RELIEVED
SOMEBODY PAINTED OVER
THAT MURAL...

18:37.792 --> 18:39.250
'CAUSE YOU NEVER
HAD TO GO THROUGH
THE HARD PART--

18:39.250 --> 18:43.166
NEVER HAD TO SHOW IT
TO THE WORLD,

18:43.166 --> 18:45.708
NEVER HAD TO HEAR
WHAT ANYONE ELSE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.625
YOU NEVER HAD TO DECIDE
FOR YOURSELF

18:47.625 --> 18:50.000
HOW GOOD OR TALENTED
YOU REALLY ARE.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.333
WONDER WHY I
CAME OVER TONIGHT?

18:59.917 --> 19:01.041
THESE ARE THE KEYS
TO THE SCHOOL.

19:01.041 --> 19:04.750
PRINCIPAL GREEN
GAVE 'EM TO ME.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.708
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.250
OH, IF IT'S BROWN,
IT MUST BE TUESDAY.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.542
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THESE THINGS
AGAIN, WITTER?

19:32.542 --> 19:33.875
ELEPHANT SCABS.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.792
PACKED WITH
WHOLE GRAIN GOODNESS.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.667
DID YOU GUYS
SEE THE LOOK ON
PRINCIPAL GREEN'S FACE?

19:38.667 --> 19:40.458
HUH?
AT THE UNITY MURAL THING.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.375
I THOUGHT THE GUY
WAS GONNA HAVE
A BREAKDOWN.

19:42.375 --> 19:45.583
AND THAT GIRL JOEY,
SHE TOTALLY LOST IT.
CLASSIC.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.542
YEAH. LOOK, UH...

19:46.542 --> 19:49.166
I'M RUNNING MYSELF
A LITTLE POOL HERE--

19:49.166 --> 19:52.959
GUESS THE TRUE CULPRIT.
WINNER TAKES ALL.
YOU GUYS IN?

19:52.959 --> 19:53.959
HOW MUCH?

19:53.959 --> 19:56.291
IT'S ONLY A BUCK A POP.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.125
HAD TO BE CAUFIELD.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.500
YEAH,
DEFINITELY.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.208
WHAT MAKES YOU GUYS
SO SURE?

20:01.208 --> 20:04.250
'CAUSE THERE'S
NO OTHER POSSIBILITY.
HA HA HA!

20:04.250 --> 20:06.291
OK.
CAUFIELD IT IS.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.583
HEY, CAUFIELD.

20:25.583 --> 20:26.917
DO I KNOW YOU?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.667
NO, NOT REALLY,
THANKFULLY FOR ME.

20:28.667 --> 20:33.125
LOOK, RUMOR HAS IT
THAT YOU HAVE THIS
IRREPRESSIBLE URGE

20:33.125 --> 20:34.291
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF
ARTISTICALLY.

20:34.291 --> 20:37.542
WHAT, THAT THING
YESTERDAY AT THE MURAL?

20:37.542 --> 20:39.375
THAT WAS
PRETTY CLASSIC, HUH?

20:39.375 --> 20:42.500
TOO BAD I CAN'T
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.083
SO YOU DIDN'T DO IT?

20:44.083 --> 20:46.000
I DON'T KNOW.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.208
I MEAN,
EVERYONE SEEMS
TO THINK I DID,

20:48.208 --> 20:50.208
SO MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
DO THE POLITE THING

20:50.208 --> 20:52.083
AND ACCEPT THE CREDIT
AND SAY THANK YOU.

20:52.083 --> 20:56.208
MAYBE. BUT, LOOK,
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

20:56.208 --> 20:59.250
THAT NOT EVERYBODY
THINKS WHAT YOU DID
WAS FUNNY.

20:59.250 --> 21:03.083
WELL,
SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.917
IS THAT YOUR PROBLEM?

21:04.917 --> 21:09.125
YEAH, THAT'S ME.
I'M HUMORLESS.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.458
HMM. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:14.542 --> 21:16.250
I WANT YOU
TO APOLOGIZE,

21:16.250 --> 21:18.583
AND THEN I WANT YOU
TO TURN YOURSELF IN,

21:18.583 --> 21:21.208
AND I WANT YOU TO DO IT
BEFORE THE DAY IS DONE.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.667
AND WHY WOULD
I DO THAT?

21:22.667 --> 21:25.875
BECAUSE THIS TIME, YOU
JUST HAPPENED TO MESS WITH

21:25.875 --> 21:27.291
SOMEBODY I CARE ABOUT.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.500
HEY, HAVE YOU
SEEN JOEY?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.583
NO. SHE WASN'T
IN HOME ROOM.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.125
THAT'S A NICE RIG.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.000
IT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.625
EH, THAT SUCKS, HUH?

22:23.625 --> 22:25.125
WHAT'S THAT?

22:25.125 --> 22:28.792
YOUR PARENTS SHORTED YOU
ON THE OFF-ROAD PACKAGE.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.667
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.333
OH, COME ON, TOUGH GUY.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.500
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

22:36.500 --> 22:38.583
YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

22:41.375 --> 22:43.834
SO, WHAT'S NEXT, WITTER?

22:43.834 --> 22:46.417
YOU GONNA SIC YOUR
CIVIL SERVANT DAD ON ME?

22:46.417 --> 22:47.917
CAN'T YOU SEE...

22:47.917 --> 22:50.166
I'M BARELY
SHAKING IN MY BOOTS?

22:50.166 --> 22:52.166
WELL,
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

22:52.166 --> 22:53.333
THAT'S A GOOD
STARTING PLACE.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.375
WHAT I KNOW IS
I'M GONNA COUNT TO 3,

22:54.375 --> 22:56.375
AND YOU'RE
GONNA STEP ASIDE.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.542
DREAM ANOTHER DREAM,
COWBOY.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.542
THAT'S NOT HOW THIS
IS GONNA SHAKE OUT.

23:01.542 --> 23:05.875
1, 2, 3.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.375
ARE YOU WHACKED OR SOMETHING?

23:08.375 --> 23:11.542
OH, NO. NOT YET.
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.208
WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO SAY I DID IT?

23:13.208 --> 23:15.458
OK. I DID IT.
HUH, THERE. SATISFIED?

23:15.458 --> 23:18.000
OK. GOOD.
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT, HUH?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.667
I SAID, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT!

23:24.208 --> 23:28.083
I'M GONNA GO
AND APOLOGIZE.

23:28.083 --> 23:30.875
OK?

23:43.333 --> 23:43.750
[GRUNTS]

23:49.792 --> 23:51.125
AAH.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.125
UGH!

23:54.125 --> 23:55.792
[GRUNTS]

24:02.000 --> 24:03.917
[CAR HORN HONKS]

24:03.917 --> 24:05.708
HEY!

24:06.458 --> 24:09.417
ON YOUR FEET!
BOTH OF YOU!

24:12.917 --> 24:15.625
INSIDE! NOW!

24:22.959 --> 24:25.250
GET ME DAWSON LEERY
AND DAVID CURREN, PLEASE.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.417
UH, PRINCIPAL GREEN,
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

24:27.417 --> 24:29.208
NOT NOW, ANDIE. I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.375
PLEASE. IT'LL
ONLY TAKE A SECOND,

24:30.375 --> 24:31.083
AND IT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT.

24:31.083 --> 24:33.291
WHAT IS IT?

24:33.291 --> 24:34.542
I'D LIKE TO
TENDER MY RESIGNATION

24:34.542 --> 24:37.333
FROM THE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

24:37.333 --> 24:39.166
WHAT?

24:39.166 --> 24:41.542
I THINK THAT YOU
HAVE THIS IDEA ABOUT ME

24:41.542 --> 24:43.125
THAT--THAT I'M SOMEBODY
I'M NOT,

24:43.125 --> 24:45.667
THAT I'M--I'M SOMEBODY
WITH UNWAVERING INTEGRITY,

24:45.667 --> 24:46.917
AND I CAN'T LIVE UP TO THAT.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.667
CAN WE DISCUSS THIS
LATER AT LENGTH?

24:48.667 --> 24:52.625
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING MORE TO DISCUSS,
PRINCIPAL GREEN.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.625
THANK YOU.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.417
[SIGHS]

25:02.834 --> 25:05.083
Principal: NOW, SINCE
NEITHER MR. WITTER
NOR MR. CAUFIELD

25:05.083 --> 25:07.417
CHOOSE TO CLARIFY
THE MEANING OF THEIR
LITTLE TITLE FIGHT

25:07.417 --> 25:08.500
IN THE PARKING LOT,

25:08.500 --> 25:09.834
I'M COUNTING
ON THEIR FRIENDS

25:09.834 --> 25:13.667
TO LOOK OUT FOR
THEIR BEST INTEREST.
MR. LEERY?

25:13.667 --> 25:15.333
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, DAWSON.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.083
MR. CURREN?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.834
NOT A WORD, DAVE.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.667
WELL, SOMEBODY
BETTER SPEAK UP,

25:20.667 --> 25:21.834
AND YOU BETTER
SPEAK UP FAST...

25:21.834 --> 25:25.125
BECAUSE A TIMELY CALL TO
THE DEAN OVER AT DARTMOUTH

25:25.125 --> 25:28.708
WILL TRIGGER
AN IMMEDIATE REVIEW ON
YOUR EARLY ADMISSION STATUS.

25:28.708 --> 25:31.166
AND MR. WITTER,
ONE MORE SUSPENSION
ON YOUR RECORD,

25:31.166 --> 25:34.000
AND YOU CAN BEND DOWN
AND KISS THIS WHOLE HIGHER
EDUCATION DEAL GOOD-BYE.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.583
[SIGHS]

25:39.500 --> 25:43.333
OK. I HAVE
NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.500
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MURAL.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.208
HEY, SHUT UP, DAWSON.
THIS IS NOT YOUR FIGHT!

25:47.208 --> 25:48.875
IT'S NOT YOURS EITHER.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.583
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT THE REASON THAT
MR. WITTER PICKED A FIGHT

25:51.583 --> 25:53.041
WAS BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
THAT MR. CAUFIELD

25:53.041 --> 25:55.750
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE VANDALIZATION
OF THE UNITY MURAL.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.250
I WENT
NOWHERE NEAR THAT THING.

25:58.250 --> 26:01.542
AS IF I COULD GIVE
A RAT'S ASS ABOUT SOME
STUPID CHINESE DRAWING.

26:01.542 --> 26:03.667
IF YOU DIDN'T
GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT,

26:03.667 --> 26:04.708
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHAT IT WAS?

26:06.500 --> 26:10.667
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

26:12.041 --> 26:13.625
ANYONE COULD'VE
TAKEN A LOOK.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.375
SHE'S BEEN
WORKING ON IT FOR WEEKS.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.625
YEAH.
AT NIGHT AND BEFORE SCHOOL,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

26:16.625 --> 26:18.208
IT'S BEEN SEALED UP
TIGHT AS A DRUM.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.542
I'M ONE OF HER CLOSEST
FRIENDS. I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

26:20.542 --> 26:23.125
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.917
NOT TO MENTION,
IF YOU DIDN'T, AS YOU SAY,
"GIVE A RAT'S ASS,"

26:25.917 --> 26:29.834
THEN WHY WOULD YOU
GO THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE
OF FINDING OUT WHAT IT WAS?

26:31.708 --> 26:33.625
CHECK THE FLOOR, CAUFIELD.

26:33.625 --> 26:37.166
I THINK YOU
JUST PAINTED YOURSELF
INTO A CORNER.

26:38.166 --> 26:41.542
OK. YOU GOT ME.

26:41.542 --> 26:43.458
BUSTED.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.708
YEAH. I JACKSON POLLOCKED
SOME MEANINGLESS MURAL.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FOR ONE THING, IT WAS UGLY.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.542
YOU KNOW?
IT WAS AN EYE-SORE.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.834
AND NOT TO MENTION,
WHY DO I HAVE TO LOOK
AT SOME TRIVIAL GIRL'S

26:51.834 --> 26:55.458
LITTLE MESSAGE TO
THE MASSES EVERY MORNING?

26:55.458 --> 26:56.542
FRANKLY, IT OFFENDS ME.

26:56.542 --> 27:01.041
POSSIBILITY
IS OFFENSIVE TO YOU?

27:01.041 --> 27:02.458
[SCOFFS]

27:02.458 --> 27:04.375
I'M WHITE. I'M RICH.

27:04.375 --> 27:07.083
THAT'S ALL
THE POSSIBILITY I NEED.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.959
SAY AGAIN?

27:19.125 --> 27:21.041
YOU HEARD ME.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.708
THE ADVANCE COPY
OF THE P.S.A.T.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.291
THAT DAWSON HAD,

27:25.291 --> 27:26.959
I'M THE ONE
WHO STOLE IT.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.750
THAT'S HOW
I DID SO WELL
ON THE TEST, JACK.

27:28.750 --> 27:32.500
THAT'S HOW I SCORED
IN THE 99th PERCENTILE.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.125
THAT WAS YOU?

27:34.125 --> 27:37.458
OH, ANDIE.

27:37.458 --> 27:40.625
I KNOW.
SURPRISE. SURPRISE.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.208
WELL, WHY? I MEAN,
YOU KNEW THAT STUFF COLD,

27:43.208 --> 27:44.500
INSIDE AND OUT,
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.375
IF ANYBODY WAS
GONNA ACE THAT TEST,
IT WAS GONNA BE YOU.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.667
IT WAS JUST SITTING
THERE ON THE TABLE

27:51.667 --> 27:52.834
LIKE--LIKE THIS PIECE
OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT,

27:52.834 --> 27:56.333
AND NOT A CHANCE
OF GETTING CAUGHT.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.708
I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST
SEEMED LIKE THE ANSWER

27:57.708 --> 28:00.333
TO ALL MY PROBLEMS
AT THE TIME.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:04.041 --> 28:06.000
I THOUGHT THAT...

28:06.000 --> 28:08.834
YOU KNOW,
IF I ACED THE TEST,
THEN...

28:08.834 --> 28:11.417
EVERYBODY WOULD THINK
I WAS OK AGAIN.

28:11.417 --> 28:14.667
YOU KNOW,
THAT THAT WOULD
SOMEHOW CONVINCE THEM.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.875
BUT NOW THAT
I REALLY AM OK,

28:16.875 --> 28:21.000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
LIVING WITH MYSELF.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.166
HENCE YOUR RESIGNATION FROM
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

28:26.375 --> 28:29.125
JACK,
FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS,

28:29.125 --> 28:30.667
I HAVE BEEN
WALKING AROUND,

28:30.667 --> 28:32.208
FEELING LIKE
THE BIGGEST HYPOCRITE.

28:32.208 --> 28:36.125
I MEAN, DON'T YOU SEE?
I'VE BEEN SO HARD ON
ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE

28:36.125 --> 28:38.333
JUST AS A WAY
OF PUNISHING MYSELF.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.792
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THAT.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.250
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING?

28:49.875 --> 28:51.583
I'M GONNA TELL
PRINCIPAL GREEN
TOMORROW.

28:51.583 --> 28:53.542
NO. YOU'RE NOT.

28:53.542 --> 28:54.792
YEAH, I AM.

28:54.792 --> 28:57.542
NO. NO. ANDIE, LOOK,
THINK ABOUT THIS, OK?

28:57.542 --> 29:00.041
YOU SCREWED UP. FINE. OK?
IT WAS A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

29:00.041 --> 29:03.708
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO GET KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

29:03.708 --> 29:06.834
FOR CHEATING ON SOMETHING
THAT HAS THE WORD PRACTICE
IN FRONT OF IT?

29:06.834 --> 29:09.041
JACK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT?

29:09.041 --> 29:11.500
I WANT TO BE
FREE OF THIS THING

29:11.500 --> 29:13.542
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.458
YOU KNOW?
FREE OF WHAT I DID,

29:15.458 --> 29:16.917
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO GO TO THE MIRROR

29:16.917 --> 29:20.083
AND RECOGNIZE
WHO I AM AGAIN.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.875
ANDIE, THERE'S
GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY.

29:21.875 --> 29:26.125
JACK, I'VE THOUGHT LONG
AND HARD ABOUT THIS. OK?

29:26.125 --> 29:28.375
THERE IS NO BETTER WAY.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.083
NOT FOR ME.

29:32.792 --> 29:34.750
DO YOU MIND?

29:34.750 --> 29:37.792
I'M HAVING THIS STEAK
FOR DINNER TONIGHT WITH
A NICE BERNAISE SAUCE.

29:37.792 --> 29:38.917
WELL, WHAT AM I HAVING?

29:38.917 --> 29:41.333
[SIGHS] BREAD AND WATER.

29:41.333 --> 29:42.792
DOUG,
I'M A SOLDIER HERE,

29:42.792 --> 29:44.375
RETURNING FROM
THE KILLING FIELDS.

29:44.375 --> 29:47.583
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHERE'S MY PURPLE HEART,
MY TICKER-TAPE PARADE?

29:47.583 --> 29:49.500
WATCH IT ON
YOUR BLACK AND WHITE.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.708
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH
A COAT HANGER AS AN ANTENNAE

29:51.708 --> 29:53.125
AT THE CHEVRON STATION...

29:53.125 --> 29:54.959
WHERE YOU'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO BE PUMPING GAS

29:54.959 --> 29:56.750
FOR THE REST OF YOUR
NATURAL BORN LIFE, PACEY.

29:56.750 --> 29:57.792
OF ALL
THE BONE-HEADED MOVES.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.917
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:59.917 --> 30:00.917
I WAS RIGHT.
IT WAS MATT CAUFIELD.

30:00.917 --> 30:03.291
YEAH, AND THAT
LETS YOU OFF THE HOOK HOW?

30:03.291 --> 30:05.625
BECAUSE THE GUY DESERVES
WHATEVER HE GETS, OK?

30:05.625 --> 30:07.792
PREFERABLY HIS SILVER
SPOON SHOVED UP HIS ASS.

30:07.792 --> 30:09.834
OH, THAT'S FUNNY, PACEY.
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

30:09.834 --> 30:10.875
OH, THIS IS RICH.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.291
HERE I AM, TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.125
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
A GUY JUST CAN'T WIN.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.291
NO. HE CAN'T.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.917
NOT IF HE COMPLETELY
OVERREACTS TO A SITUATION.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.875
IF YOU'RE GONNA THROW AWAY
YOUR FUTURE, JUST DO IT
ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT, OK?

30:21.875 --> 30:23.041
OH, HEY,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

30:23.041 --> 30:24.250
DON'T THINK
I EVER CARED HERE.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.959
I WAS ONLY
DOING DAWSON A FAVOR.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.708
DAWSON.
YES, DAWSON.

30:27.708 --> 30:29.500
YOU KNOW,
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.208
THINK BACK WITH ME,
WAY BACK.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.208
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE BEGINNING
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

30:33.208 --> 30:36.417
DAWSON LEERY RETURNS FROM
THE BIG CITY A CHANGED MAN,

30:36.417 --> 30:38.542
DETERMINED TO SEVER TIES
WITH GIRL ACROSS THE CREEK.

30:38.542 --> 30:41.750
SO, HE ASKS TRUSTED FRIEND
TO LOOK AFTER SAID GIRL

30:41.750 --> 30:42.875
DURING THE DELICATE
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.458
TRUSTED FRIEND,
OF COURSE HE OBLIGES,

30:44.458 --> 30:48.875
AND NOW TRUSTED FRIEND
GETS HIS HEAD HANDED
TO HIM ON A PLATTER.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.667
SO YOU GUYS
JUST TRADED ME OFF

30:52.667 --> 30:54.458
LIKE SOME SORT
OF BASEBALL CARD?

30:54.458 --> 30:56.208
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

30:56.208 --> 30:57.166
WHAT?

30:57.166 --> 30:59.500
US. YOU AND ME.
I THOUGHT THAT--

30:59.500 --> 31:01.667
YOU THOUGHT WHAT?

31:03.041 --> 31:06.000
I GUESS I THOUGHT
SOMETHING ELSE, PACEY.

31:21.166 --> 31:22.708
Principal:
YOU HAVE CONSISTENTLY

31:22.708 --> 31:24.583
FLAUNTED MY AUTHORITY,
MR. CAUFIELD.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.708
YOU HAVE
UNDERMINED THE ABILITY
OF MY TEACHERS TO EDUCATE.

31:27.708 --> 31:31.208
AND NOW, YOU CHALLENGE
MY COMMITMENT...

31:31.208 --> 31:34.875
TO RESHAPE THIS SCHOOL
INTO A COMMUNITY.

31:34.875 --> 31:37.708
PRINCIPAL GREEN,
IT WAS ONLY A MURAL.

31:37.708 --> 31:40.166
YES,
IT WAS ONLY A MURAL...

31:40.166 --> 31:44.291
BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A MURAL.

31:44.291 --> 31:46.708
YOU DON'T FOOL ME,
MR. CAUFIELD.

31:46.708 --> 31:48.708
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

31:48.708 --> 31:51.875
YOU'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE UNTOUCHABLE.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.625
SO YOU DISRUPT THE SCHOOL.
YOU DISOBEY THE RULES.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.083
YOU SERVE
TO DIVIDE THE STUDENT BODY

31:56.083 --> 31:58.000
WITH YOUR ARROGANCE
AND YOUR ATTITUDE.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.208
NOW, YOU MAY BE SMART,
AND YOU MAY BE RICH,
MR. CAUFIELD,

32:01.208 --> 32:03.291
BUT YOU ARE NOT
ABOVE THE LAW.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.834
AND FOR THAT REASON,
IT IS MY DECISION...

32:07.834 --> 32:10.125
THAT YOU BE EXPELLED
FROM CAPESIDE HIGH.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.125
EXPELLED?

32:16.125 --> 32:17.083
YOU HEARD ME.

32:17.083 --> 32:19.417
Caufield:
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR?

32:19.417 --> 32:21.041
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.041
PRINCIPAL GREEN...

32:24.041 --> 32:25.917
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

32:25.917 --> 32:28.250
WHAT MY FATHER'S
GONNA SAY ABOUT THIS?

32:28.250 --> 32:31.750
YES.
I HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA

32:31.750 --> 32:34.166
OF WHAT YOUR FATHER'S
GONNA SAY ABOUT THIS.

32:50.792 --> 32:52.041
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THERE?

32:52.041 --> 32:55.000
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.375
NO SIGN OF...
BIRCH CANE
OR KNUCKLE RAPPING.

32:58.375 --> 33:00.208
NO.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.291
LET'S FACE IT.
PACEY'S GONNA BE
LUCKY

33:02.291 --> 33:05.500
IF HE GETS OFF
WITHOUT ANOTHER
SUSPENSION.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.291
THE WAY THINGS
ARE GOING, I MEAN...

33:09.291 --> 33:12.917
YOU SHOULD
HAVE JUST ASKED ME
TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.875
EXCUSE ME?

33:14.875 --> 33:18.166
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE LITTLE WIFE-SWAPPING
ARRANGEMENT.

33:18.166 --> 33:19.333
WIFE--

33:19.333 --> 33:21.875
JOEY, THAT'S
NOT HOW IT WAS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.667
THEN HOW WAS IT?

33:23.667 --> 33:26.000
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
IT WAS MONTHS AGO.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.208
I MEAN, THINGS WERE
VERY DIFFERENT
BETWEEN US.

33:28.208 --> 33:31.417
YOU'RE RIGHT.
BACK THEN I FELT LIKE
YOU STILL UNDERSTOOD ME.

33:31.417 --> 33:32.250
OH, AND I DON'T NOW?

33:32.250 --> 33:34.667
NO. I EVER ASKED
FOR YOUR PITY!

33:34.667 --> 33:36.834
IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T ABOUT PITY.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.500
I COULDN'T
BE THERE FOR YOU,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.000
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE SOMEONE
YOU CAN TURN TO,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.417
SOMEONE YOU COULD
TALK TO.

33:42.417 --> 33:44.917
NOW TELL ME--
WHERE IS THE HARM
IN THAT?

33:44.917 --> 33:46.500
WELL, IT JUST WOULD
HAVE BEEN NICE

33:46.500 --> 33:48.208
IF THAT SOMEONE
COULD HAVE MUSTERED A SHRED
OF GENUINE CONCERN.

33:48.208 --> 33:51.417
THAT SOMEONE IS IN
THAT ROOM RIGHT NOW

33:51.417 --> 33:53.834
BECAUSE HE'S GOT
A HELL OF A LOT MORE

33:53.834 --> 33:56.041
THAN A SHRED OF CONCERN.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.667
[SIGHS] JOEY,
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

33:59.667 --> 34:01.625
DOING WHAT?

34:01.625 --> 34:03.834
CASTING ASPERSIONS
ON PEOPLE

34:03.834 --> 34:05.542
WHO OBVIOUSLY
CARE ABOUT YOU.

34:05.542 --> 34:09.208
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I DON'T WANT
THE BEST FOR YOU?

34:09.208 --> 34:12.166
PACEY--I MEAN,
PACEY'S A LOTTA THINGS--

34:12.166 --> 34:15.375
IMPULSIVE,
THOUGHTLESS,
STUBBORN--

34:15.375 --> 34:17.333
BUT AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED
THIS YEAR,

34:17.333 --> 34:19.625
CAN YOU HONESTLY DOUBT
FOR A SECOND...

34:19.625 --> 34:21.542
THAT HE DOESN'T TRULY
CARE ABOUT YOU?

35:27.417 --> 35:29.542
LET ME JUST STATE
FOR THE RECORD...

35:29.542 --> 35:31.208
I LIKE THAT MAN
IN THERE.

35:31.208 --> 35:33.917
IN FACT, I'LL GO YOU
ONE BETTER--HE IS
A GREAT HUMAN BEING.

35:33.917 --> 35:34.917
HE'S GOT THE FAIRNESS
OF LINCOLN,

35:34.917 --> 35:37.125
THE CHARISMA OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.125
HE'S EVEN-HANDED
AND TEMPERED

35:39.125 --> 35:41.291
AND, IF I MAY
SAY SO MYSELF,

35:41.291 --> 35:44.291
ACUTELY SUSCEPTIBLE
TO A CERTAIN TYPE
OF IRREVERENT HUMOR.

35:44.291 --> 35:44.834
SO HE LET YOU
OFF.

35:44.834 --> 35:47.250
NOT EXACTLY.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.625
BUT HE DIDN'T
SUSPEND YOU.

35:48.625 --> 35:52.291
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M NOT PACKING
MY BAGS QUITE YET.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.583
ALTHOUGH 3 DAYS OFF
WOULD HAVE PROVIDED
A WELCOME DIVERSION.

35:54.583 --> 35:55.875
OK, SO DIVULGE.
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THERE?

35:55.875 --> 35:58.875
I'M GONNA BE
A MENTOR.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.250
BE A WHAT?

36:00.250 --> 36:02.125
MENTOR. YOU KNOW,
THE CAPESIDE
MENTORING PROGRAM.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.166
SINCE I SEEM TO BE
COMPLETELY INCAPABLE

36:04.166 --> 36:06.208
OF SUPPRESSING MY OWN
JUVENILE IMPULSES,

36:06.208 --> 36:07.959
PRINCIPAL GREEN
SEEMS TO THINK

36:07.959 --> 36:10.125
THAT I WOULD BENEFIT
FROM THE COMPANY
AND EXAMPLE

36:10.125 --> 36:12.917
OF SOMEONE
HALF MY AGE.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.125
HA HA HA!

36:14.125 --> 36:15.291
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

36:15.291 --> 36:16.125
WHAT ABOUT
THE POOR KID?

36:16.125 --> 36:18.125
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TEACH HIM?

36:18.125 --> 36:20.792
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

36:20.792 --> 36:23.625
YOU GONNA TEACH HIM
THE IMPORTANCE OF
KEEPING A SECRET?

36:23.625 --> 36:26.166
LIKE, SAY, FROM,
YOU KNOW...JOEY,
FOR EXAMPLE?

36:26.166 --> 36:28.291
OH, THAT...

36:28.291 --> 36:28.834
UH...SHE TOLD YOU.

36:28.834 --> 36:30.834
YEAH.

36:30.834 --> 36:33.166
HMM. WELL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE ODDS ARE

36:33.166 --> 36:36.000
THAT YOU, YOURSELF,
WILL BE AS ENLIGHTENED
AND FORGIVING A PERSON

36:36.000 --> 36:39.208
AS PRINCIPAL GREEN
JUST WAS?

36:39.208 --> 36:41.000
NOT GOOD, PACE.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
OK...

36:42.000 --> 36:43.917
NOT GOOD.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.458
TO SAY THAT I AM
PROFOUNDLY SHOCKED
AND DISTURBED

36:53.458 --> 36:55.333
BY WHAT YOU DID
WOULD BE
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

36:55.333 --> 36:58.250
YOUR BEHAVIOR WAS
DECEITFUL, IMMORAL,

36:58.250 --> 37:01.708
AND ULTIMATELY,
A DISGRACE
TO THIS SCHOOL.

37:01.708 --> 37:04.000
I KNOW.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.417
I JUST...WISH THAT
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU
SOONER.

37:07.417 --> 37:10.250
YOU KNOW I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO INFORM

37:10.250 --> 37:11.834
THE EDUCATIONAL
TESTING SERVICE,

37:11.834 --> 37:13.792
AND THAT THEY'RE GONNA
CANCEL YOUR SCORES,

37:13.792 --> 37:16.000
AND THAT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO
FORFEIT YOUR CHANCE

37:16.000 --> 37:17.708
AT A MERIT
SCHOLARSHIP.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.166
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
YES.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.875
NOW...YOU SAY THAT
THERE WERE OTHER
STUDENTS

37:21.875 --> 37:23.834
WHO WERE AWARE
OF THIS TEST,

37:23.834 --> 37:26.667
BUT YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE
WHO EXPLOITED IT.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.583
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN ABOUT THAT?

37:28.583 --> 37:31.625
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.583
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO HERE?

37:34.583 --> 37:37.834
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
ABOUT THIS, ANDIE?

37:37.834 --> 37:40.375
UM...

37:40.375 --> 37:42.250
WELL...

37:42.250 --> 37:47.917
I HEARD THAT MATT CAUFIELD
WAS EXPELLED FROM CAPESIDE
TODAY.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.708
AND WHAT I DID WAS...

37:50.708 --> 37:53.667
NO LESS GRAVE
OR SERIOUS AN OFFENSE.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.417
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK?

37:56.417 --> 38:00.291
I CLEARED OUT MY LOCKER,
AND I KNOW THAT ALL ACTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

38:00.291 --> 38:01.291
ANDIE--

38:01.291 --> 38:02.583
MOST OF ALL...

38:02.583 --> 38:04.583
I'M SORRY FOR
LETTING YOU DOWN

38:04.583 --> 38:06.625
AND FOR LETTING MYSELF
DOWN.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.208
ANDIE...

38:10.208 --> 38:13.417
YOU AND MATT CAUFIELD
HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.875
HE IS A SELFISH,
SPOILED YOUNG MAN

38:15.875 --> 38:18.458
WHO HAS NO SENSE
OF RIGHT OR WRONG,

38:18.458 --> 38:21.000
WHO ACTUALLY
TAKES PLEASURE
IN HURTING OTHERS.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.166
THE ONLY PERSON
THAT YOU HURT...
IS YOURSELF.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.625
BUT I DID CHEAT.

38:27.625 --> 38:30.625
AND IT WAS WRONG,
AND I SHOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR IT.

38:30.625 --> 38:34.125
WHEN YOU WERE ON
THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE,

38:34.125 --> 38:35.875
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I TRIED
TO TEACH YOU

38:35.875 --> 38:37.792
WAS THE IDEA OF
PROPORTIONALITY.

38:37.792 --> 38:39.792
MAKE THE PUNISHMENT
FIT THE CRIME, YES,

38:39.792 --> 38:43.417
BUT ALSO LOOK AT
THE PERSON.

38:43.417 --> 38:47.792
NOW, MATT CAUFIELD,
HE DOESN'T DESERVE,
NOR WOULD HE BENEFIT

38:47.792 --> 38:50.125
FROM MY LENIENCY.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.542
BUT ANDIE McPHEE...

38:52.542 --> 38:55.000
SHE JUST MIGHT.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.583
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

39:00.583 --> 39:02.083
DON'T SAY
ANYTHING.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.166
GET YOUR STUFF.
PUT IT BACK IN
YOUR LOCKER.

39:04.166 --> 39:07.834
AS FOR YOUR
PUNISHMENT...

39:07.834 --> 39:10.750
I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THAT FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.291
THANK YOU,
PRINCIPAL GREEN.

39:18.291 --> 39:20.500
THANK YOU.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.500
WHAT ON EARTH?

39:45.166 --> 39:46.542
HEY, POTTER.

39:46.542 --> 39:48.625
PACEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

39:50.208 --> 39:51.250
PAINTING.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.417
DUH!

39:52.417 --> 39:54.208
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE GOOD

39:54.208 --> 39:55.542
IF YOU COULD START
WITH A BLANK CANVAS.

39:55.542 --> 39:57.583
BLANK CANVAS,
HUH?

39:57.583 --> 39:59.458
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN,
TABULA RASA,

39:59.458 --> 40:02.959
RETURN TO POINT "A".
ALL THAT GOOD STUFF.

40:02.959 --> 40:06.041
AND, UH,
WHO, MAY I ASK

40:06.041 --> 40:08.583
TOLD YOU I WAS PLANNING
ON REPAINTING THE MURAL
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

40:08.583 --> 40:11.542
AH, IT'S JUST
THIS GUY I MET
OUT IN THE STREET.

40:11.542 --> 40:12.792
SOME GUY.

40:12.792 --> 40:13.875
YEAH, YOUR TYPICAL
DO-GOODER TYPE.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.834
MMM.

40:17.959 --> 40:20.041
SO...YOU GONNA
THANK ME?

40:21.625 --> 40:22.750
FOR WHAT?

40:22.750 --> 40:25.125
WELL, FOR ALL MANNER
OF THINGS.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.250
YOU KNOW,
LIKE DEFENDING
YOUR HONOR,

40:26.250 --> 40:28.917
BUCKING THE SYSTEM--

40:28.917 --> 40:30.542
TILTING AT WINDMILLS
WHILE IN THE THROES OF
A MISGUIDED HERO COMPLEX?

40:35.166 --> 40:36.750
WELL, YEAH, THAT, TOO.

40:38.625 --> 40:41.542
PACEY, IF I WAS GOING
TO THANK YOU FOR ANYTHING,

40:41.542 --> 40:44.834
IT WOULD BE
FOR BEING YOURSELF,

40:44.834 --> 40:47.875
AND, YOU KNOW,
NOT CARING WHAT
ANYBODY ELSE THINKS

40:47.875 --> 40:52.375
AND FOR KNOWING
IN YOUR HEART WHAT'S
RIGHT AND WRONG AND...

40:52.375 --> 40:55.375
FOR BEING THERE
THIS YEAR...

40:55.375 --> 40:57.667
WHEN I NEEDED YOU
THE MOST.

41:04.542 --> 41:05.917
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:07.166 --> 41:10.083
SO YOU WANT HELP?

41:13.458 --> 41:14.959
ONE CONDITION.

41:14.959 --> 41:16.959
SURE. NAME IT.

41:16.959 --> 41:19.667
BE HONEST.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.667
THE ONLY REASON
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING
OUT WITH ME

41:21.667 --> 41:24.625
IS SIMPLY BECAUSE
DAWSON TOLD YOU TO?

41:24.625 --> 41:27.875
YEP. THAT'S
THE ONLY REASON.

41:27.875 --> 41:29.166
HMM.

41:30.500 --> 41:31.834
YOU NEED TO GET A LIFE.

41:32.291 --> 41:35.291
