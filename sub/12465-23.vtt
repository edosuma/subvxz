00:05.506 --> 00:10.209
Morning, campers!
(imitates rooster crowing)

00:10.211 --> 00:13.846
Hope you all had
a good night's stay
at camp hi-joe-watha!

00:13.848 --> 00:17.282
Boiled eggs are
in the bucket.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.184
I got your shower tickets here

00:19.186 --> 00:21.854
'cause it really smells
like a lot of you guys
could use these.

00:21.856 --> 00:25.758
Joseph rooney!
What is going on?

00:25.760 --> 00:28.660
I turned our backyard
into a campground.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.629
No, i can see that.
I guess what i was wondering is,

00:30.631 --> 00:32.831
Why did you turn our backyard
into a campground?

00:33.768 --> 00:36.335
To make some coin
so i can buy my tickets
for sparf.

00:37.738 --> 00:41.306
Sparf stands for stevens point
awesome rock festival.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.709
It is the musical event
of the summer!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.911
Last year,
one direction headlined,

00:45.913 --> 00:48.347
And i got my picture taken
with zane,

00:48.349 --> 00:51.850
Back before he broke
this directioner's heart.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.653
Mom, your son is a genius.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.539
Every hotel in town is booked.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.424
The money that i'm making
is going to get me
into the festival,

00:58.426 --> 01:00.592
Where andy grammer
is performing.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.960
Mom, can you stand it?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.862
No, but i can end it.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.232
Have them all gone
by the time i get home,

01:07.234 --> 01:09.835
And you, sir,
are grounded for a week.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.703
Give me back my hat.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.572
I'll get my shorts later.

-I need to talk about holden.
-I need to talk about diggie.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.469
Both:
Sorry, you go.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.405
I am so glad
that you came to me.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.075
We girls need a tribe
that we can count on.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.845
Okay, andie, you start.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.614
Well, holden and i
bought tickets to sparf
before we broke up.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.617
Diggie and i bought
tickets to sparf
before we broke up.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.485
(gasps)
same-sies.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.321
All: Whoa!

02:36.323 --> 02:37.456
I know, right?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.757
(chuckles)

02:38.759 --> 02:40.926
What do you want,
todd stetson?

02:40.928 --> 02:44.763
Just to brighten your day
one chiseled ab at a time.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.598
Drink it in, glasses.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.402
Beat it, beef jerky.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.471
I have to hit
the weight room anyway.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.006
It's my abs-iversary.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.642
Four years and the six-pack
is still going strong!

02:58.078 --> 02:59.545
(mouths)

02:59.547 --> 03:02.814
(all groan)

03:02.816 --> 03:05.083
Okay, back to
your dual dilemmas.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.486
Andie, do you still want
to go to sparf?

03:07.488 --> 03:08.654
No.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.455
If i go,
holden will be there,

03:10.457 --> 03:13.392
And if i don't go,
then i'll just be at home alone,

03:13.394 --> 03:15.678
Thinking about him.

03:15.679 --> 03:17.963
Okay, what you need
is a break-up intervention.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.566
Give your tickets to holden,
i will not go to sparf,

03:20.568 --> 03:23.468
And you and i will have
a super-fun girls' weekend
instead!

03:24.405 --> 03:27.439
I once did
a break-up intervention
for south salamanca.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.473
That's my co-star on...

03:31.545 --> 03:33.178
<i>♪ sing it loud! ♪</i>

03:33.179 --> 03:34.812
By the end of the weekend,
she was so over her ex,
you don't even know.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.418
She just says that a lot.
"you don't even know."

03:39.420 --> 03:41.453
Ooh, that is really fun.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.755
You'd give up sparf for me?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.424
That's the nicest thing
anyone's done

03:45.426 --> 03:47.659
Since my brother took
that garter snake
out of my hair.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.998
I just don't know
how to respond to you

03:53.000 --> 03:55.500
When you say things like that.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.588
So, moving on,

03:59.589 --> 04:02.040
Maddie, do you still want
to go to sparf with diggie?

04:02.042 --> 04:04.443
Um... Maybe.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.111
I don't know.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.679
Both:
She totally knows.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.515
Okay. Yes.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.517
I still want to go
to sparf with diggie,

04:12.519 --> 04:14.786
But if i ask him
and he says no,

04:14.788 --> 04:17.556
I'm going to feel
like a doofus.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.757
It's bad enough
that i already got dumped.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.859
I don't want to feel
like a dumped doofus.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.097
Okay, so then don't ask him.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.433
Just talk to him, you know?
See what he's feeling.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.836
Suss out the sitch.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.639
Yeah, i can suss.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.806
Consider it sussed.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.944
(school bell rings)

04:41.448 --> 04:44.016
(celebratory music playing)

04:45.185 --> 04:46.818
Aw!

04:46.820 --> 04:49.888
Jerk-tourage,
you remembered my abs-iversary!

04:55.095 --> 04:59.498
Yo! Look who scored
free tickets to sparf,
courtesy of liv.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.733
Apparently, she's doing
some stupid girls' weekend

05:01.735 --> 05:05.003
Because andie is still
super upset about being
dumped on live television.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.039
(scoffs)

05:07.041 --> 05:09.007
Girls can be so sensitive.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.576
I know, dude!
So sensitive.

05:11.578 --> 05:15.981
So, do you want to go with me?
And please don't say no, man.
It's going to break my heart.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.116
Well, i do enjoy
watching you cry,

05:18.118 --> 05:21.653
But not as much
as i'll enjoy being at sparf!

05:21.655 --> 05:24.556
Both:
♪ oh, we're going to sparf ♪

05:24.558 --> 05:26.041

05:28.728 --> 05:29.927

05:29.930 --> 05:31.897
Yes, but you're grounded,
remember?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.199
Oh, i didn't think
you meant for sparf, too.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.601
You meant sparf, mom?
It's sparf!

05:37.538 --> 05:39.855
Joey, look at me.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.173
Your punishment
will go from one week
to the entire summer

05:42.176 --> 05:45.544
If you so much as step foot
on the festival grounds.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.613
Parker, honey,
enjoy the festival.

05:50.751 --> 05:54.586
Well, no andy grammer concert
for this grammer jammer.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.590
Hold on.
Maybe there is a way.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.692
My noggin smells a challenge.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.377
You heard them.

06:02.378 --> 06:04.061
I can't step foot
on festival grounds, parker.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.964
There is no possible way
for me to go.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.899
Challenge accepted!

06:08.836 --> 06:11.670
Right, noggin?
My noggin says yes.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.771
(inaudible dialogue)

06:20.314 --> 06:21.880
Hey!

06:21.882 --> 06:23.749
Have not talked to you
in a while.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.120
I've just got to find out
if diggie wants to go
to sparf with me

06:28.122 --> 06:32.023
Without asking diggie
if he wants to go
to sparf with me.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.992
I've just got
to suss out the sitch.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.228
So...

06:37.297 --> 06:38.897
Our sparf tickets came.
(chuckles)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.165
Oh, yeah.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.900
We bought those together
when we were...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.568
Both: Together.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.970
Yeah.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.472
So, the ticket--

06:46.473 --> 06:47.973
The-the-the--
uh, the-the tickets--

06:47.975 --> 06:50.075
What do you--
what do you want
to do about these tickets?

06:51.011 --> 06:54.112
What do i want to do?
I want to go to the concert
with maddie.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.048
But i don't know
if she wants to go with me.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.818
It's time to become
diggie smalls,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.720
Teen detective.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.324
Well, i don't know, maddie.
What do you... Want to do?

07:06.326 --> 07:11.296
(high-pitched voice)
i mean, i guess i could
give you the tickets,

07:11.298 --> 07:14.800
If you wanted
to take... Someone.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.171
Yes! Nice wordplay, maddie.

07:19.173 --> 07:22.774
I mean, (scoffs) like,
clearly, that someone is me.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.877
Okay. Yeah, no, there is...

07:25.879 --> 07:27.813
Someone i want to take.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.783
Nailed that.
She clearly knows i mean her.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.286
What does he mean?
Who is this "someone"?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.087
(gasps)

07:36.089 --> 07:38.256
Does he want
to take someone else?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.261
Play it cool, girl.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.298
Well, maybe i want
to take someone else!

07:47.734 --> 07:49.401
Wait, what?
You have someone else?

07:49.403 --> 07:52.103
Maybe i do.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.773
Okay, well, you know what? Fine.
Why don't you just go with them?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.492
Maybe i will!

07:56.493 --> 07:58.210
Why'd you even ask me
if i wanted the tickets?

07:58.212 --> 08:01.012
So that i could...
Tell you who i'm going with!

08:02.149 --> 08:04.749
Fine. Go ahead.
Tell me. Who?

08:07.354 --> 08:11.223
Yo, glasses,
i flexed so hard,
my sleeves fell off.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.661
I'm going to sparf
with todd stetson.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.696
Right?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.030
Yeah, we are.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.299
Stacy!

08:21.301 --> 08:23.835
We're a no-go for sparf.
Todd got an upgrade.

08:26.773 --> 08:27.539
Later, dillie.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.210
It's diggie.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.849
(doorbell rings)

08:40.787 --> 08:43.788
I'm ready for a girls' weekend.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.757
Thanks for the ride, grandma!

08:45.759 --> 08:46.925
(engine revs)

08:46.927 --> 08:48.226
(tires screeching)

08:50.831 --> 08:52.731
Andie, i am so excited
that you're here.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.284
I have so many great ideas.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.836
First, we are going to start by
painting each other's toenails
all kinds of exotic patterns,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.104
Or all black for you,

08:59.106 --> 09:00.972
And then... (giggles)

09:00.974 --> 09:02.841
Stop!

09:02.843 --> 09:05.777
Only dolphins can
understand you right now.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.247
Sorry. I'm just so excited.

09:09.249 --> 09:13.351
I know, but i have an idea
that will definitely get
my mind off holden.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.953
I want to do...

09:17.824 --> 09:19.190
This.

09:20.494 --> 09:24.095
You want to volunteer
at the slaughterhouse?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.897
Even better.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.233
We're going to the dump
to collect scrap metal

09:28.235 --> 09:31.736
For a weekend
welding extravaganza!

09:31.738 --> 09:34.105
(indifferently)
yay. Okay.

09:34.107 --> 09:37.943
Yeah. I mean,
if-if rusted, filthy metal

09:37.945 --> 09:40.879
Is what is going to heal
that broken heart of yours,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.280
Then i am in.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.283
Thank you.
(screams)

09:45.285 --> 09:47.018
(laughs nervously)
wow.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.054
These are heavy.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.922
Yeah, well,
you want them thick

09:50.924 --> 09:52.190
So that the rats
can't chew through.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.896
Best girls' weekend ever!

09:59.533 --> 10:01.967
Hey, munch, i figured out
a way around your grounding.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.036
You're going to sparf
without stepping foot
on anything.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.239
(gasps)
did you find a magic ring
in an ancient cave

10:08.241 --> 10:11.042
That bestows
the power of levitation
to its guardian?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.946
-No.
-Oh.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.916
Just stop munching out
and follow me.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.888
Welcome to air parker,

10:23.890 --> 10:26.858
Offering daily
non-stop service to sparf.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.296
This chair is just going
to float me to the concert?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.932
And your feet will never
touch the festival grounds.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.101
Which means
that i am not breaking
the rules of my grounding!

10:36.103 --> 10:37.902
Parker, you're a genius!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.873
Wait, is this
another elaborate prank

10:41.875 --> 10:44.209
To launch me
into low earth orbit?

10:45.445 --> 10:48.013
I'm not going to lie.
It crossed my mind.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.348
But don't worry,
i'll keep you tethered
with this leash,

10:50.350 --> 10:53.284
And can pull you around
while we sparf our brains out!

10:53.286 --> 10:55.020
I want to high-five
your noggin!

10:55.022 --> 10:56.087
High-five away.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.389
Aw.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.826
All right, you ready?
Comfortable?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.963
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Nice lumbar support.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.232
Aw, a cup holder?
That's so thoughtful.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.969
Yeah, man,
i am ready for liftoff!

11:12.939 --> 11:16.408
Oh, i'm floating! Wee!

11:18.845 --> 11:22.914
(electronic music playing)

11:27.087 --> 11:29.988
Maddie, how epic is sparf?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.222
(camera clicks)
yeah, it's great.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.292
Um, i could actually use a hand.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.927
No can do, boo.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.128
I got one hand
for my selfie stick

11:37.130 --> 11:38.630
And one for my thumbs up.

11:38.632 --> 11:39.898
(camera clicks)

11:41.034 --> 11:41.900
Yeah, um...

11:43.036 --> 11:43.868
So...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.471
This was a mistake.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.340
Um, i'm just going to go.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.379
-Hey, rooney.
-Diggie.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.282
Oh! Diggie showed up!

11:57.284 --> 12:01.453
Yes! The thought
of todd stetson and me
is killing him.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.289
Almost as much
as it is killing me.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.591
Hey, diggie.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.892
'sup?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.894
Oh, stuff.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.198
Lots of stuff.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.234
(chuckles)
okay.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.969
Um, what are you doing here?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.038
Oh, i'm doing the same thing
you're doing, you know.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.006
Enjoying the concert.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.908
With my date.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.512
You-- you brought a--
with your-- your-your date--

12:27.514 --> 12:30.081
What-what-what date?
Who date?

12:30.083 --> 12:34.586
(girl singing)
<i>♪ oh, you don't even know ♪</i>

12:36.123 --> 12:38.490
South salamanca?

12:38.492 --> 12:40.091
(giggles)

12:40.093 --> 12:42.577
Liv's hollywood friend

12:42.578 --> 12:45.062
Who tried to steal diggie
from me last time she was here?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.931
He brought her?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.268
(raspy voice)
diggie done, done me wrong.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.637
(squeals)

12:52.639 --> 12:55.073
(screams)

12:58.145 --> 12:59.244
South.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.311
-Maddie!
-South!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.481
You're in stevens point

13:03.483 --> 13:05.984
At a concert with diggie!

13:07.654 --> 13:10.555
What? South was in town
so i asked her to come.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.125
Okay, that's a lie.
I tracked her down in l.A.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.527
And used my savings
to fly her out

13:15.529 --> 13:17.629
Because she annoys maddie
as much as todd annoys me.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.097
I'm not proud.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.332
I'm a little proud.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.636
Double date selfie!

13:24.638 --> 13:25.970
(camera clicks)

13:36.550 --> 13:40.351
Okay. (chuckles)
there it is.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.321
A bunch of slimy, rusted metal.

13:44.257 --> 13:48.426
It's kind of funny
i had to go to the dump
to get over being dumped, huh?

13:50.063 --> 13:53.064
Ha. So funny.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.668
I think you know
what we need to do now.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.003
Take a shower
that lasts for days

13:59.005 --> 14:02.173
And scrub with steel wool
but never quite feel clean?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.541
No.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.011
We weld!

14:07.013 --> 14:09.047
(electronic music playing)

14:14.621 --> 14:17.155
South salamanca?
Are you for real?

14:17.157 --> 14:19.090
Oh, it doesn't get any realer.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.060
All i wanted to do
was go to sparf with diggie,

14:22.062 --> 14:25.129
And now, i am stuck
with todd stetson,

14:25.131 --> 14:28.499
And diggie is
with south salamanca.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.034
Ha!

14:31.137 --> 14:32.403
You know,
i'm just going to say it.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.706
You biffed this, mad dog.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.074
Biffed it bad.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.611
Dig-a-licious!

14:39.613 --> 14:41.512
(giggles)
i've got a treat for you.

14:41.514 --> 14:45.350
It's so good.
You don't even know!

14:46.653 --> 14:50.688
Her voice is like
a thousand tiny hammers
clubbing my head.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.125
You did this
to yourself, dillie.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.595
Okay. Oh, thank you!
You're just going
to feed it to me. All right.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.464
-So good.
-Uh-huh. Yup.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.699
Best popcorn ever.
So yummy.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.167

15:06.206 --> 15:08.506
Would you open
my lemonade for me

15:08.508 --> 15:10.508
With your abs?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.790
(sighs)
abs-olutely refreshing.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.661
I can also grate cheese
if you need it.

Oh, not as much fun

16:12.605 --> 16:14.172

16:14.174 --> 16:15.573

Hello, father.

to your mother...

If i get to take a ride.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.134

22:50.136 --> 22:52.169
All right.
Bon voyage, father.
