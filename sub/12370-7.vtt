DO YOU SEE THE PERPETRATOR
IN THIS LINEUP?

00:08.800 --> 00:12.429

FOR A WOMAN

00:48.882 --> 00:51.634
IN HER EARLY 40s.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.805

- WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BORN IN 1969.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.438

I CAN'T REMEMBER MY LINES?

I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED
THAT I HAVEN'T SLEPT FOR WEEKS.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.699
- WELL, YOU COULD ALWAYS DO
SUDOKU OR BRAIN EXERCISES.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.826
- SO IT'S COME TO THIS.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.495
I HAVE TO WORK ON MY BRAIN

01:18.578 --> 01:21.498
LIKE AN UGLY WOMAN.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.542
- I WISH I COULD TURN
MY BRAIN OFF FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.503
I MEAN,
BETWEEN RADIATION APPOINTMENTS

01:26.586 --> 01:28.004
AND DOCTOR VISITS
AND WORRY,

01:28.087 --> 01:29.881
I AM SICK AND TIRED
OF BEING SICK AND TIRED.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.841
AND I AM TIRED OF PEOPLE
ASKING HOW I AM

01:33.468 --> 01:35.970
"HOW <i> ARE</i> YOU?"

- WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

01:37.430 --> 01:39.182
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE
HOW YOU ARE.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.975
NO, THEY'RE JUST GLAD
THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES

01:41.059 --> 01:44.437

AND GROSS AS A BRAIN TUMOR.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.192
- MATT AND I BROKE UP.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.985
- OH, SO HE <i> WAS</i> CHEATING.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.238
- ACTUALLY, HE WASN'T.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.698
JEEZ, YOU PUT ONE GPS TRACKER
UNDER A GUY'S TRUCK,

01:55.782 --> 01:59.118
AND THEY GET ALL,
"OOH, YOU DON'T TRUST ME."

01:59.202 --> 02:00.578
- JOY, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.372
- YEAH, ME TOO.
I'M THE ONE WHO FIXED YOU UP.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.748
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT DATING A THERAPIST

02:03.832 --> 02:04.749
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.209
- ME TOO.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.752
BUT THE PROBLEM
WITH DATING A THERAPIST

02:07.836 --> 02:11.005
IS WHEN THEY BREAK UP WITH YOU,
IT'S LIKE A DIAGNOSIS.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.050
HE SAID I HAD NO CHANCE
AT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP

02:14.133 --> 02:16.010
UNTIL I CAN TRUST SOMEONE.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.388
SO I HAVE TWO CHOICES.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.390
EITHER I CAN SIT BACK
AND WAIT FOR SIMON,

02:23.518 --> 02:25.395

02:25.478 --> 02:29.315

AIMLESSLY.

YES.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.761

09:08.881 --> 09:10.299
- WELL, THEN,
MEET WITH ME TONIGHT.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.135
- BUT YOU AND ME--

09:13.219 --> 09:15.304
I'M A LITTLE OLDER
THAN YOU ARE.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.139
- WELL, WOMEN DON'T BEGIN
TO BE BEAUTIFUL

09:17.223 --> 09:18.140
UNTIL THEY HIT 40.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.058
- [gasps]

09:19.141 --> 09:20.685
I THOUGHT ONLY WOMEN OVER 40
SAID THAT.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.478
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.564
both: SHH.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.984
- DO YOU HEAR THAT WIND?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.653
IT'S SAYING,
"THROW CAUTION TO ME."

09:30.736 --> 09:34.824
- YES, I HEAR IT NOW.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.953
- ELKA, MAMIE AND I
WENT OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES

09:39.036 --> 09:40.830
BEFORE YOU AND I STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER AGAIN.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.457
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU AND TOMMY,

09:43.541 --> 09:45.001
THE VETERINARIAN?

09:45.084 --> 09:47.837
- WE COULDN'T AGREE
ON BEDROOM TEMPERATURE.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.214
HE LIKES IT 80 DEGREES.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.466
I WAS FREEZING.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.554
- LOOK, I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A POSITION LIKE THIS BEFORE.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.557
- WELL, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE CAN'T BOTH DATE ROY.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.726
- CERTAINLY NOT.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.686
- I HAVE A PLAN.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.481
WHY DON'T YOU BOTH DATE ME?

10:07.565 --> 10:08.733
- THAT'S NOT REALLY A PLAN.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.985
- THAT'S JUST YOU
SAYING THE OPPOSITE

10:11.068 --> 10:12.820
OF WHAT WE JUST SAID.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.030
- I'M A GOOD GUY.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.906
I DON'T WANT TO HURT
EITHER ONE OF YOU.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.534
BUT MAYBE THIS MAKES SENSE.

10:18.617 --> 10:21.329
AT OUR AGE, THERE ARE TWO WOMEN
FOR EVERY MAN,

10:21.412 --> 10:24.332
TWO BUNS FOR EVERY HOT DOG.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.210
- WELL, MAYBE THIS COULD WORK.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.378
- I GUESS.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.672
I DO LIKE HOT DOGS.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.893
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOU HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR TOO?

10:43.976 --> 10:47.229
- I'M SO GLAD TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO HAS THIS THING IN COMMON.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.439
- YOU KNOW,
OTHER PEOPLE TRY TO UNDERSTAND,

10:48.522 --> 10:49.315
BUT THEY CAN'T.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.524
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.902
- YES.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.029
BUT YOU SAY IT.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.406
- IT'S HOW YOU TELL YOURSELF
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET

10:57.490 --> 10:58.324
YOUR ILLNESS
TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE,

10:58.407 --> 10:59.909
BUT YOU CAN'T STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.202
- STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.
- YES!

11:01.285 --> 11:03.371
- OH, EXACTLY.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.581
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
LIFE IS TOO SHORT,

11:05.664 --> 11:06.874
AND IF YOU SEE SOMETHING
YOU WANT,

11:06.957 --> 11:08.417
EVEN IF YOU HAVE
TO KEEP IT A SECRET

11:08.501 --> 11:09.460
FROM YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS,

11:09.543 --> 11:10.920
THAT YOU SHOULD JUST

11:11.003 --> 11:13.214
REACH ACROSS THE TABLE
AND GRAB IT?

11:13.297 --> 11:14.715
- [gasps]

11:14.799 --> 11:16.425
I DO.
- OH.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.719
SO YOU'RE FORGETTING
A FEW DETAILS.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.721
THAT PROVES THAT YOUR MIND
IS MEANT FOR BIGGER THINGS.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.057
- THAT IS SO TRUE, DOUG.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.142
I MEAN, DID GALILEO KNOW
WHERE HIS CAR KEYS WERE

11:25.226 --> 11:27.269
WHEN HE WAS WORKING
ON HIS...

11:27.353 --> 11:29.105
SCIENCE?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.651
- YOU'RE THE NERD.
YOU TELL ME.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.448
- I DID IT.
- WHAT?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.282
- I TRUSTED YOU.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.992
YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE
ON THE TABLE,

11:42.076 --> 11:42.993
AND I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.286
- [chuckles]

11:44.370 --> 11:46.330
- I DIDN'T CHECK YOUR TEXTS,
YOUR EMAILS.

11:46.414 --> 11:50.292
I DIDN'T EVEN SWAB YOUR GLASS
FOR A FUTURE DNA TEST.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.752
THIS IS NEW FOR ME.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.171
I FEEL FREE.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.298
- WELL, YOU DON'T JUST
FEEL FREE,

11:56.382 --> 11:57.466
YOU LOOK IT.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.592
YOUR EYES, LESS NARROW.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.637
YOUR FOREHEAD, WORRY-FREE.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.639
JOY, I DON'T WANT THIS
TO SOUND WEIRD,

12:03.722 --> 12:06.100
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE A TEENAGER.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.101
- [chuckles]

12:07.184 --> 12:07.935
IT'S NOT WEIRD,

12:08.018 --> 12:10.855
BUT MAYBE TAKING IT
A BIT TOO FAR.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.399
- THE GENTLEMAN ORDERED
A BOTTLE OF WINE,

12:13.482 --> 12:14.775
BUT I'LL NEED TO SEE
SOME I.D., MISS.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.027
- REALLY?

12:17.111 --> 12:19.947
OH, ALL RIGHT.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.830
- I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.584
IT SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S HANDS EVERYWHERE.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.090
- I KNOW.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.051
IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHICH AREA TO FOCUS ON.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.847
- MAMIE SUE,
HOW ABOUT YOU DO THE TOP PART,

12:44.930 --> 12:48.225
AND I'LL GO TO TOWN
ON THE BOTTOM?

12:48.309 --> 12:51.145
- BUT ALL THE FUN PARTS
ARE ON THE BOTTOM.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.521
- OH, LADIES,

12:52.605 --> 12:55.024
THERE'S PLENTY OF PUZZLE
TO GO AROUND.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.735
WE'RE ALL GONNA GET
OUR PIECES IN.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.862
- WHAT IF I'M DONE FIRST?

12:59.945 --> 13:03.532
- WELL, YOU CAN WATCH
ROY AND ME FINISH UP.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.704
- DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

13:08.787 --> 13:09.997
ONCE YOU'RE WELL?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.041
- YEAH, SURE, ALL THE TIME.
YOU?

13:12.124 --> 13:15.044
- WELL, I REALLY WANT
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW?

13:15.127 --> 13:17.046
LIKE, MAYBE ADD A WING
TO THE ANIMAL RESCUE CENTER,

13:17.129 --> 13:21.509
BUT MONEY IS JUST SO TIGHT
THESE DAYS.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.636
- I COULD HELP.
- WHAT?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.222
NO.
NO, I--

13:26.305 --> 13:28.807
THAT'S SWEET, BUT IT JUST
DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.226
- DOUG, I WOULD LOVE TO.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.061
IT'S SUCH A GREAT CAUSE.
I'LL GET MY CHECKBOOK.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.064
- OR YOU COULD SWIPE YOUR CARD
ON THIS.

13:38.108 --> 13:41.320
- SO THIS WILL GO RIGHT
INTO YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT?

13:41.403 --> 13:45.407
- BUT THEN STRAIGHT
INTO THE RESCUE FUND.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.410
BUT DON'T DO IT IF YOU'RE HAVING
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST DOUBTS,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.455
WHICH I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE
BY YOUR WRINKLED BROW.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.960
- NO, NO.
NO DOUBTS.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.088
SEE, ALL SMOOTH NOW
LIKE A TEENAGER.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.300
- I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.636
BLOOP!
OH, THIS IS FUN.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.429
- YEAH.
THEN WHY NOT DO IT AGAIN?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.139
- OKAY.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.058
WHOOP!
- WHOOP.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.438
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
WITH US?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.566
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING OUT
WITH ROY.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.776
- THAT'S NOT WORKING OUT
SO GREAT.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.112
- IT'S LIKE
HE'S THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI,

14:23.195 --> 14:27.199
AND WE'RE TWO SUPERMODELS
FLOWN IN TO ENTERTAIN HIM.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.788
- AND HOW IS IT LIKE THAT?

14:32.871 --> 14:37.209
- WELL, WE ATE HUMMUS AND TALKED
ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.798
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO?

14:42.881 --> 14:45.134
MAKE HIM CHOOSE.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.219
- AND WE'LL JUST ACCEPT
HIS CHOICE

14:47.303 --> 14:48.971
AND NOT LET IT
COME BETWEEN US.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.433
- WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE
SHARING A MAN NEVER WORKS.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.310
- OH, CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF WE DID THAT?

14:54.393 --> 14:55.436
IT'D BE A NIGHTMARE.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.770
- HORRIFIC.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.480
THE ONLY MALE WE'RE INTERESTED
IN SHARING

14:58.564 --> 14:59.648
IS OUR NEW DOG.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.817
- OH, DID THE ADOPTION
GO THROUGH?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.444
- WELL, NOT OFFICIALLY,

15:03.527 --> 15:07.281
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'RE GONNA GET APPROVED.

15:07.364 --> 15:11.327
- YES, I GOT A VERY GOOD FEELING
FROM HIM.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.747
- AS DID I.
PLUS I SLEPT WITH HIM.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.542
- WHAT?
SO DID I!

15:18.626 --> 15:19.793
- ME TOO.
- WHA--

15:19.877 --> 15:23.839
- OH, DEAR GOD,
WE'RE ESKIMO SISTERS.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.716
- SO THAT BASTARD
SEDUCED ALL OF US

15:25.799 --> 15:26.842
ALL IN ONE DAY?

15:26.925 --> 15:29.303
- HE'S EFFICIENT.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.349
- HE TOLD ME
HE HAD A BRAIN TUMOR.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
- HE TOLD ME
HE HAD TRUST ISSUES.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.896
- HE SAID I WAS A GENIUS.

15:38.979 --> 15:43.192
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T GIVE HIM ANY MONEY.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.111
all: OH, MY GOD.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.041
- WE CALLED THE SHELTER.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.668
YOU DON'T EVEN WORK THERE.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.379
YOU WERE JUST VOLUNTEERING
AND STOLE THEIR DATABASE.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.382
THAT'S FOR BEING A LIAR.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217
- THAT'S FOR NOT HAVING
A BRAIN TUMOR.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.220
- AND THIS IS
FOR CALLING ME BRILLIANT.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.438
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.191
I'M NOT SOME JERK
WHO PREYS ON OLDER WOMEN.

16:24.274 --> 16:27.861
both: OLDER WOMEN?

16:27.945 --> 16:32.074
- WOMEN OF ALL AGES
LOOKING FOR DOGS

16:32.157 --> 16:33.450
ARE OFTEN LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.744
YES, I TOOK
SOME OF YOUR MONEY,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.622
BUT I ALSO GAVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.584
MELANIE, I HELPED YOU
FORGET ABOUT YOUR BRAIN TUMOR.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.254
AND, JOY,
I HELPED YOU TRUST AGAIN.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.588
AND, VICTORIA,
I MADE YOU FEEL SMART.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.465
SO WHAT'S THE HARM?

16:48.549 --> 16:50.426
- YOU BILKED US
OUT OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.595
- WELL, MY GUESS
IS YOU'VE PAID MORE

16:53.679 --> 16:55.931
FOR THINGS THAT DIDN'T MAKE YOU
FEEL AS GOOD.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.441
- OKAY, HE'S NOT ALL WRONG.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.067
I SENT ALL MY KIDS
TO PRIVATE SCHOOL,

17:07.151 --> 17:09.569
AND THEY'RE ALL DOPES.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.821
- AND I MUST ADMIT
IT WAS NICE TO BE WITH SOMEONE

17:11.905 --> 17:13.449
WHO WAS GOING THROUGH
THE SAME THING I WAS,

17:13.531 --> 17:15.576
EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T REALLY.

17:15.659 --> 17:16.993
- I DID LIKE THE FEELING
OF LETTING GO

17:17.077 --> 17:18.454
AND TRUSTING SOMEONE,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.079
THOUGH HE WASN'T
TO BE TRUSTED.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.790
- AND I DID FEEL SMARTER,
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.126
I MEAN, HOW CAN SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE

17:24.209 --> 17:25.961
IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY?

17:26.044 --> 17:27.087
- MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT

17:27.171 --> 17:28.922
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.632
IT'S THAT
YOU'VE JUST BEEN SLEEPING.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.634
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.970
MAYBE I JUST NEEDED
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.305
- YOU KNOW,
I SUPPOSE IF HE OFFERS

17:36.388 --> 17:37.306
TO GIVE US BACK OUR MONEY,

17:37.389 --> 17:39.141
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.602
[gasps]

17:41.685 --> 17:42.936
HE ESCAPED.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.938
- OH, MY GOD.

17:45.022 --> 17:49.026
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
IN <i> AMERICAN PRESIDOODLE 2:</i>

17:49.109 --> 17:51.445
<i>ALL THE PRESIDOODLE'S MEN.</i>

17:51.528 --> 17:53.655
MAYBE THAT WAS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

17:53.739 --> 17:56.283
BECAUSE IN THAT MOVIE,
SHE FAKED HER OWN DOGNAPPING

17:56.366 --> 17:58.368
TO FOOL THE RUSSIANS.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.915
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE
NUMBER THREE IS THE PERP?

18:02.998 --> 18:04.625
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
- OH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.043
- ALL RIGHT,
NUMBERS ONE, TWO, AND FOUR,

18:06.126 --> 18:09.505
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.673
- DON'T DO THIS TO ME,
BABY.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.300
I LIED TO THE OTHER TWO,

18:13.383 --> 18:16.637
BUT YOU'RE
THE SMARTEST, SEXIEST,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.555
MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
THAT I'VE EVER MET.

18:18.639 --> 18:22.142
all: AW.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.186
- COME ON, LADIES.
IT'S A TWO-WAY MIRROR.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.438
HE CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHO HE'S TALKING TO.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.567
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

18:30.651 --> 18:33.153
HE'S PREYED ON A LOT
OF OTHER VULNERABLE WOMEN.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.531
MY SUGGESTION?
GET A DOG.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.866
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.872
- YOU'VE GOT TO CHOOSE, ROY.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.999
- NO MORE MENAGE A TROIS,

18:46.083 --> 18:47.876
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE

18:47.960 --> 18:49.211
SINCE THOSE WERE
THE ONLY THREE WORDS

18:49.294 --> 18:51.755
I KNEW IN FRENCH.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.341
- BUT I CAN'T CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.844
- ROY?
WHO'S OUT THERE?

18:56.927 --> 18:58.720
- YOUR MOTHER'S HOME?

18:58.804 --> 19:01.890
- THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
I'LL LET MOTHER DECIDE.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.559
SHE ALWAYS KNOWS
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.895
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.896
MOTHER?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.940
PUT YOUR HOUSECOAT ON.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.568
I WANT YOU TO CHOOSE
MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.238
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MAMIE SUE?

19:16.321 --> 19:19.241
YOU CAN HAVE HIM.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.368
- OH, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

19:21.451 --> 19:23.620
YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.081
- HOW ABOUT
WE BOTH GET OUT OF HERE?

19:26.164 --> 19:29.084
- NO RUSH.
ISN'T SHE 112?

19:29.167 --> 19:31.044
- OH, THAT'S WHAT SHE CLAIMS.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.131
SHE'S 114 IF SHE'S A DAY.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.720
- GUESS WHO GAVE
GEORGE CLOONEY A BATH.

19:39.803 --> 19:43.348
all: AW.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.811
- OH, I'M SO GLAD WE PICKED
A GOOD NAME FOR HIM.

19:47.895 --> 19:51.440
NOW WE CAN ALL HONESTLY SAY
WE'VE SLEPT WITH GEORGE CLOONEY.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.903
- JUST REMEMBER, HE'S A DOG,
NOT A PERSON.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.447
WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME
THOSE WACKY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN

19:58.530 --> 20:00.532
WHOSE LIVES REVOLVE
AROUND THEIR PETS.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.951
- THEN I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM IN THIS.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.119
- OH!

20:04.202 --> 20:06.121
- OH, DEAR GOD, THAT'S CUTE.

20:06.204 --> 20:08.123
- IT'S ADORABLE.
PUT IT ON HIM NOW.

20:08.206 --> 20:11.209
- NO, SERIOUSLY.
PUT IT ON HIM, NOW.
