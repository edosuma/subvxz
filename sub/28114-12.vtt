Frankie hasn't written me,

02:37.797 --> 02:39.116
Nothing.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.909
I just wanted to see if she wrote you.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.053
No, she hasn't.

02:44.054 --> 02:46.156
I'd tell you. I promise.

She texted me yesterday,

learned how to make

- Thank you.
- Sorry. Just a tad distracting.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.253
It's okay. So, anyway,
there's this, like,

04:23.254 --> 04:26.890
little underground network
of kids who are, like,

04:26.891 --> 04:29.527
giving me tips on sightings

Look, honey, she's the

04:50.771 --> 04:52.584
Who are you sending these videos to?

04:52.585 --> 04:55.235
I mean, can you just be here? With me?

04:55.236 --> 04:56.627
Put your phone down?

04:56.628 --> 04:58.744
Are you constantly texting with Evan?

04:58.745 --> 05:00.558
Don't call him that.

05:00.559 --> 05:02.008
Sam, say his name.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.715
What?

05:13.289 --> 05:14.592
He's gonna die that he's gonna see this

- live and in person.
- Wait. What do you mean?

05:17.124 --> 05:19.042
You invited him to our lunch?

05:19.043 --> 05:20.456
What is your problem?

05:20.457 --> 05:23.581
Look, I'm happy that
you're happy with Evan,

05:23.582 --> 05:26.349
but this was supposed to be our lunch.

05:26.350 --> 05:28.001

- I don't get it.

05:28.002 --> 05:30.057
(sighs) What? What don't you get?

05:30.058 --> 05:33.178
- I don't believe you.
- I didn't say anything bad.

05:33.179 --> 05:34.485
I disagree.

05:34.486 --> 05:37.638
I think your whole attitude is bad.

05:37.639 --> 05:39.279
Can you say anything good?

05:39.280 --> 05:42.111
Can you say something good about him?

05:42.112 --> 05:45.794
Sam? Can you say anything
good about the person

05:45.795 --> 05:48.282

fucking happy right now?

Sam.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.935
He has very clean hair.

05:57.332 --> 06:00.545
Well, we're just gonna have
to spend less time together.

06:00.546 --> 06:02.879
Because I want to be with
him every chance I get.

06:03.872 --> 06:05.288
Okay, fine.

06:05.289 --> 06:07.000
That's cool.

06:07.612 --> 06:08.773
Less time.

06:08.774 --> 06:12.140
