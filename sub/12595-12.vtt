14:52.099 --> 14:53.726
<i>The problem I have</i>

14:53.809 --> 14:56.353
<i>is the posture of the wolf.</i>

14:56.437 --> 14:58.230

<i>is such a harsh,</i>
<i>squarish-oval shape.</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:11.994
It's just a hard block.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.913
You don't really lose it
into the skin.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.498
With a few little tricks,

15:16.582 --> 15:18.292
you could have really softened
up the edge of this tattoo,

Cleen.

<i>Not like I've never drawn</i>
<i>a girl before,</i>

<i>but if you're not drawing 'em</i>
<i>all the time, it's tough.</i>

15:41.357 --> 15:43.817

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
<i>- Well, yeah, you know,</i>

<i>hands are tough to tattoo</i>
<i>when you're tracing 'em,</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:49.657
let alone when you're just
drawing 'em from scratch.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.533
- Well, Cleen, I think you did
a pretty good job

15:51.617 --> 15:53.035

15:53.118 --> 15:54.495
<i>Proportions are correct.</i>

15:54.578 --> 15:55.996
<i>Black and gray</i>
<i>not being your specialty,</i>

15:56.080 --> 15:57.623
<i>this is really smooth shading.</i>

15:57.706 --> 15:59.041
<i>A lot of solid black areas,</i>
<i>a lot of contrast.</i>

15:59.124 --> 16:01.168
One of the shining moments
in this tattoo

16:01.251 --> 16:03.962
<i>is the highlight</i>
<i>on the edge of her breast</i>

16:04.046 --> 16:05.881
<i>where it's back</i>
<i>behind the black background.</i>

16:05.964 --> 16:09.093
Really creates dimension
and contrast to her body,

16:09.176 --> 16:10.219
<i>but the tip of the nose,</i>
<i>the shading inside of the eyes,</i>

16:10.302 --> 16:11.845
<i>got away from you</i>
<i>just a little bit.</i>

16:11.929 --> 16:14.598
- The only section
that I feel

16:14.682 --> 16:16.225
was a little bit strange
is the ribs.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.393
<i>Hard lining the ribs like that</i>

16:17.476 --> 16:19.770
<i>gives 'em a really inset feel</i>

16:19.853 --> 16:21.438
that makes her look
a little hungry.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.984
- Anthony.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.070
- Overall, you deliver
in this tattoo.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.407
<i>You have a tough,</i>
<i>hard aesthetic</i>

16:31.490 --> 16:32.991
<i>with a lot of rich black.</i>

16:33.075 --> 16:34.410
<i>The way that you shaded</i>
<i>those knuckles that dark</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:37.913
<i>but then just left that little</i>
<i>bit of a highlight on there,</i>

16:37.996 --> 16:39.998
it's gutsy--
you really understand

16:40.082 --> 16:43.252
how to use the silhouetting,
the shadowing, the richness.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.294
<i>Those are tricks</i>
<i>that not many people</i>

16:44.378 --> 16:45.921

under their belt have.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.090
- That dimension
and that shading

16:48.173 --> 16:49.925
has really brought
this tattoo to life.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.761
But one of the problems
I have is,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.097
<i>from wrist to elbow on both</i>
<i>arms is a little bit short</i>

16:55.180 --> 16:58.142
<i>in proportion</i>
<i>to the rest of the body.</i>

17:02.646 --> 17:04.982

<i>James, because you chose</i>
<i>a less dynamic position,</i>

17:33.677 --> 17:35.888
you don't get

- I got my seat.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.845
- James and Cleen, today
you got to call your own shot.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.931
One of you will move on to fight
for the title of Ink Master,

29:27.015 --> 29:28.600
and for one of you,
this is the end of the line.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.643
It's time to see how you did.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.813
Cleen, let's start with you.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.025
- Some definite shining moments
of this thing:

29:37.108 --> 29:39.986
<i>technically, very smooth</i>
<i>application, the color.</i>

29:40.069 --> 29:41.654
<i>The skull is the best part</i>
<i>of the tattoo.</i>

29:41.738 --> 29:44.157
<i>I love the detail in the skull.</i>

29:44.240 --> 29:45.575
<i>I love the color in the skull.</i>

29:45.658 --> 29:46.993
<i>I love the idea of it</i>
<i>upside-down.</i>

29:47.076 --> 29:49.204
But from a distance,
this thing is pretty weird.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.747
<i>The dagger is very hidden,</i>

29:50.830 --> 29:51.539
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>you were gonna be able to do</i>

29:51.623 --> 29:54.375
<i>a kick-ass snake drawing.</i>

29:54.459 --> 29:55.710
- I think it's a kick-ass
snake drawing.

29:55.793 --> 29:59.714
- Everybody up here completely
hates this snake head.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.216
<i>I don't really like</i>
<i>the connection</i>

30:01.299 --> 30:02.759
<i>of the snake head to the neck.</i>

30:02.842 --> 30:04.886
<i>The harsh overbite</i>
<i>and weak power to the lower jaw</i>

30:04.969 --> 30:07.722
in this thing just looks
kinda goofy.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.265
- The placement of the eye
on this thing

30:09.349 --> 30:11.559
is what changes the dynamic
of the face.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.520
<i>The eye's just floating</i>
<i>center part.</i>

30:13.603 --> 30:15.230
<i>Slide that eye back</i>
<i>a little more.</i>

30:15.313 --> 30:16.856
<i>Put it where it would go,</i>

30:16.940 --> 30:19.567
then it's not as debatable
why the head looks so crazy.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.194
- It's an artist's rendering.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.820
<i>- The body of the snake</i>
<i>looks like</i>

30:22.904 --> 30:24.989
<i>a limp water balloon</i>
<i>folding over everywhere.</i>

30:25.073 --> 30:26.199
- Like a fat python.

30:26.282 --> 30:29.202
- It could have been
a lot tougher.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.412
- James.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.790
- [exhaling]

30:33.873 --> 30:36.251
- You've done a lot
of incredible line work in here.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.045
<i>It's so detailed,</i>
<i>but it's just hard to read.</i>

30:39.128 --> 30:42.090
<i>I stand 4 feet away</i>
<i>from this person's leg,</i>

30:42.173 --> 30:44.133
and I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.804
- I probably should have went
just a touch smaller,

30:47.887 --> 30:49.138
<i>just so I could pimp out</i>
<i>a lot more things</i>

30:49.222 --> 30:52.600
and I think I bit off
a lot more than I could chew.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.102
<i>- I don't think the size</i>
<i>is a problem.</i>

30:54.185 --> 30:56.771
<i>I think the complexity</i>
<i>of the design is the problem.</i>

30:56.854 --> 30:57.772
<i>You compromised your outline</i>
<i>in a lot of areas.</i>

30:57.855 --> 31:00.525
<i>You compromised</i>
<i>your color saturation.</i>

31:00.608 --> 31:02.151
<i>- I tried to put everything</i>
<i>in the world in it.</i>

31:02.235 --> 31:05.822
You know, it was my chance
to step up and go all out.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.116
<i>- The flower looks great,</i>
<i>but what about the color,</i>

31:08.199 --> 31:09.951
<i>especially the foo dog itself?</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:11.536
<i>When you look at it, does</i>
<i>this thing jump off the screen</i>

31:11.619 --> 31:14.747
or do you feel like it's muted
like I feel like it's muted?

31:14.831 --> 31:16.708
- I didn't want to do
like a flat red.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.168
I wanted to throw
some dimensions

31:19.252 --> 31:20.670
and some shading elements
into it,

31:20.753 --> 31:22.171
and I think it did mute it down.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.339
- Both of you are batting
against each other,

31:23.423 --> 31:25.425
and if you're going up
against Cleen,

31:25.508 --> 31:27.427
you know the color's
gonna be vibrant,

31:27.510 --> 31:28.720
you know, so the battle's on.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.222
I mean, there's definitely
moments in both tattoos

31:31.306 --> 31:32.640
that have highs and lows.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.018
That's my judging norm.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.981
- All right, guys.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.357
Do we have a decision?

31:41.441 --> 31:42.859
Who took it down, Ollie?

31:42.942 --> 31:43.985
- For me, man, I think
if either one of these guys

31:44.068 --> 31:47.155
{\an8}would have come
with a bulletproof drawing,

31:47.238 --> 31:48.990
{\an8}<i>it would have put them ahead.</i>

31:49.073 --> 31:51.909
{\an8}James' tattoo is too complex.
Cleen's tattoo is too simple.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.661
- But there's no doubt
that it's a snake.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.580
<i>- The majority of this tattoo</i>
<i>is a blue water balloon</i>

31:55.663 --> 31:58.291
<i>that bubbles around everywhere.</i>

31:58.374 --> 32:01.669
James' tattoo overall,
it's a more interesting tattoo.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.379
<i>It's a lot to look at,</i>
<i>so you have a lot more time</i>

32:03.463 --> 32:07.008
to look through the tattoo and
find appealing parts about it.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.302
- Look, when you have a guy
like Dave, who isn't a tattooer,

32:09.385 --> 32:12.597
doesn't recognize
what it is he's looking at,

32:12.680 --> 32:14.432
then that's where
the debate occurs.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.808
From here to here,
all I can see

32:15.892 --> 32:17.685
<i>is really bright color</i>
<i>to the left</i>

32:17.769 --> 32:19.896
<i>and then I see just maroon</i>
<i>to the right.</i>

32:19.979 --> 32:21.689
<i>- I think he could have</i>
<i>loosened up the detail</i>

32:21.773 --> 32:23.024
<i>and made it a little more</i>
<i>simple of a image,</i>

32:23.107 --> 32:25.485
and it would have stood out
stronger.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.277
{\an8}- It should have, could have,
would have,

32:26.361 --> 32:27.904
{\an8}<i>but color versus his color,</i>

32:27.987 --> 32:30.657
{\an8}<i>Cleen's tattoo</i>
<i>looks like a sticker.</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:35.078
