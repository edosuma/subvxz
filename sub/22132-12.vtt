yeah

27:01.220 --> 27:03.100
JD

27:03.099 --> 27:07.928
when he was back in Florida is involved
with you

27:10.250 --> 27:13.250
&lt;operand> two &lt;/operand> I'm really
sorry Jesse

27:13.250 --> 27:15.509
but i gotta go on patrol with me

27:15.509 --> 27:18.509
but I just thought it'd be better

27:19.048 --> 27:22.028
yeah thanks

27:22.028 --> 27:25.028
yeah

27:29.410 --> 27:32.410
&lt;operand> two &lt;/operand> years on in
Florida

27:33.430 --> 27:36.430
why would he tell us

27:39.859 --> 27:43.909
I want to see me I understand that you
two knew each other before you came here

27:43.910 --> 27:48.830
yeah Florida

27:51.339 --> 27:56.949
JD no one on ebay watch Cano -

27:56.950 --> 27:59.950
it's because what happened in Florida

28:09.480 --> 28:15.509
it was my idea not to tell you I thought
it would be better if no one knew we had

28:15.509 --> 28:17.160
a relationship

28:17.160 --> 28:20.160
all right what happened

28:23.398 --> 28:28.319
civilian and a lifeguard died

28:29.099 --> 28:32.308
during a rescue and I did something

28:33.329 --> 28:36.329
really stupid

28:38.118 --> 28:41.958
i perjured myself she's protecting the
lifeguards reputation

28:41.959 --> 28:46.068
yeah I didn't want his family to know
and now it's all gonna come out anyway

28:47.058 --> 28:50.959
the guy behind Travis a lifeguard

28:52.089 --> 28:53.990
having a lot of problems

28:53.990 --> 28:59.420
chemical yeah alcohol and everyone knew
he was the kind of guy who could never

28:59.420 --> 29:01.730
seem to catch a break we all tried to
help

29:01.730 --> 29:04.730
ok how to go down

29:07.220 --> 29:10.308
I was working 12 hour away from land

29:10.970 --> 29:14.900
it was a slow day I could watch my water
and his no problem

29:14.900 --> 29:18.140
we're about to go off duty and Leon
decides to go for a swim

29:18.140 --> 29:24.530
probably trying to sober up he got in
trouble a civilian just some man on the

29:24.529 --> 29:26.420
beach went in to save them

29:26.420 --> 29:31.730
it was a rough day and now they're both
in trouble I went for the civilian first

29:33.700 --> 29:35.879
he was fine when he reached the sand

29:35.878 --> 29:40.108
and then his heart gave out failure from
exertion

29:40.108 --> 29:43.978
so they both died yeah and you tweak the
story

29:43.979 --> 29:48.719
Leon had three kids I figured it
basically didn't matter how the story

29:48.719 --> 29:51.719
came out since they were both dead and i
was the only witness

29:53.048 --> 29:58.329
it was arrogance Sean was me trying to
control everything fix everything it was

29:58.329 --> 30:00.519
a foolish thing to do

30:00.519 --> 30:03.579
who brought the shoot Leon's wife

30:03.579 --> 30:06.638
perfect thanks you get

30:06.638 --> 30:10.569
yes it either give me for negligence
dereliction of duty or perjury and

30:10.569 --> 30:14.648
either way my reputation as a lifeguard
which is the only thing I truly treasure

30:14.648 --> 30:16.508
is ruined

30:16.509 --> 30:19.509
no no it's not i'm gonna handle this

30:20.648 --> 30:25.868
dawn listen to me I'll take care of it I
promise you

I know what to say sorry

30:49.849 --> 30:51.709

like this anyway

get this weight off my chest

30:59.869 --> 31:02.869

I bet you need

35:02.170 --> 35:04.619
french teacher

35:04.619 --> 35:07.579
all your time playing

35:07.579 --> 35:10.579
yeah

35:15.309 --> 35:18.309
just humans

35:26.909 --> 35:29.548
as District Attorney you should know
that the county that you represent

35:29.548 --> 35:35.250
allowed a known alcoholic to remain on
duty now Leon Travis repeatedly went to

35:35.250 --> 35:37.139
a supervisor and he was ignored

35:37.139 --> 35:41.670
if you love this case to continue that
will all come out of course you should

35:41.670 --> 35:45.030
settle your county is completely
negligent

35:45.030 --> 35:50.130
I realize that but miss Masterson was
only trying to do our duty

35:50.130 --> 35:53.670
she was protecting your reputation and
the reputation of the Dead lifeguard

35:53.670 --> 35:56.670
you're forcing her to become a witness
for the plaintiff

35:58.949 --> 36:04.529
listen we all wish it could be different
but it's not just just just tell them

36:04.530 --> 36:08.910
that unless I see that in writing by the
mall morning mr. Masterson's attorney

36:08.909 --> 36:11.519
may be forced to file against your
county

36:11.519 --> 36:14.659
yeah

36:14.659 --> 36:17.889
all right fine I'll wait to hear from
you

36:17.889 --> 36:20.889
yeah

36:23.588 --> 36:26.170
yeah

36:26.170 --> 36:29.170
yeah

36:37.010 --> 36:40.010
yeah

36:43.530 --> 36:45.050
yeah

36:45.050 --> 36:49.730
I want to talk to you about all this
done in Florida stuff JD I don't need an

36:49.730 --> 36:53.190
explanation okay fine

36:53.190 --> 36:55.619
but I need to talk about it

36:55.619 --> 37:00.659
don't ask me not to tell anyone that she
and I knew each other in Florida so I

37:00.659 --> 37:01.529
did it

37:01.530 --> 37:05.640
I didn't think it would matter it
doesn't

37:06.360 --> 37:07.400
mmm

37:07.400 --> 37:10.519
but it does because it seems like i'm
being deceitful

37:11.889 --> 37:14.889
it was deceitful JD

37:17.570 --> 37:19.000
I can't forgive it

37:19.000 --> 37:22.809
so I'm gonna ignore it and the reason
that i can do that is because it's so

37:22.809 --> 37:24.469
not like you

37:24.469 --> 37:27.259
you and I hate lies

37:27.260 --> 37:31.160
if I thought you were a liar we couldn't
even be friends but we are aren't we

37:31.159 --> 37:33.179
yes

37:33.179 --> 37:36.179
of course we're friends and it didn't
happen

37:36.719 --> 37:39.699
just leave it at that

37:39.699 --> 37:42.699
yeah

37:45.019 --> 37:51.380
how set why do you say that because
there's so little passion left between

37:51.380 --> 37:52.099
us

37:52.099 --> 37:55.099
you can't even get angry

38:00.349 --> 38:03.349
yeah

38:12.909 --> 38:18.339
it's over

38:21.150 --> 38:25.318
don't tease me I just got the call is
seven get the paperwork in the morning

38:32.199 --> 38:41.348
you know you try to tell the truth but
some times some way somehow you know

38:41.349 --> 38:44.500
there's a place where the truth will
hurt an innocent person

38:45.309 --> 38:50.108
so you tell an untruth and you wait for
it to come and get you because you know

38:50.108 --> 38:52.509
it will you just don't know when

38:52.510 --> 38:56.560
well you're waiting is over and so is
your fear

39:03.250 --> 39:10.090
you're a wonderful friendship now that
is about the nicest thing you've said

39:12.329 --> 39:14.210
yeah

39:14.210 --> 39:18.740

absolutely insane

ocean swims manic jet ski pickups and
yet here we stand and you've done great

39:25.070 --> 39:29.660

hatched in that statistic brain of yours

I've actually enjoyed your little pissed

39:37.159 --> 39:43.279
yeah we - yeah most of them haha

39:43.280 --> 39:46.970
on what you're going to learn through
this whole thing is that the harder you

39:46.969 --> 39:48.169
try to make us crap

39:48.170 --> 39:51.650
