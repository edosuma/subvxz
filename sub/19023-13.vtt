<i>You asked out a girl
stuck in an MRI machine,</i>

00:05.214 --> 00:07.299
<i>without ever seeing her face.</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:09.635
<i>Remember, no matter
what she looks like,</i>

00:09.718 --> 00:11.762
<i>be sure to play it cool.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:14.890
Yes!

00:14.973 --> 00:17.476
Yes! You are smokin' hot!

00:17.559 --> 00:19.645
ln your face!

00:21.396 --> 00:23.899
<i>That night, we went out
on our first date.</i>

00:24.775 --> 00:26.860
<i>Had our first dinner.</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.240
<i>Rented our first movie.</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.494
<i>Took our first long drive.</i>

00:35.577 --> 00:37.704
Look out!

00:37.788 --> 00:39.957
<i>Killed our first raccoon.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:44.837
<i>Ever since then, every date we've
been on has always ended the same way.</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:51.051
No!

00:51.134 --> 00:53.637
Cox wants me back at the hospital.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.391
- But the page is addressed to Lillian.
- That's me.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.397
<i>What a drag.</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:09.987
<i>That was probably the wrong time
to ask for a quickie.</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:25.544
l have been coerced

01:25.627 --> 01:29.214
by the forces of evil into
conducting rounds this morning.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.508
Why do you have to do rounds?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.052
Because l'm sleepy. How's that?

01:34.136 --> 01:36.889
<i>To make this a more
palatable experience for moi,</i>

01:36.972 --> 01:40.893
l am not going to call you by
your names. l'll be referring to you

01:40.976 --> 01:44.855
by whatever distinguishing physical
characteristic occurs to me.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.232
You, Chicken Beak.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.694
What causes pneumonia
presenting with diarrhoea?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.571
- Legionella.
- Nice job.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.366
lt turns out your mind's
just as sharp as your nose.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.577
And you, Dye Job.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.205
What are the elements
of Whipple's triad?

02:03.290 --> 02:08.586
<i>It's hard to describe how scary
it is when you don't know an answer.</i>

02:12.299 --> 02:15.427
l can't remember. l am so sorry.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.721
What are you sorry about?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.182
Dr Kelso yells at us
when we don't know...

02:20.265 --> 02:21.683
Children,

02:21.767 --> 02:25.103
you can't let that bloated bag
of hate affect you.

02:25.187 --> 02:29.900
Being a doctor is as much about
finding the answers as knowing them.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.278
For instance, take Clarabelle's
patient here, Mr Yeager.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.656
We have no idea what's wrong with him.

02:35.739 --> 02:42.162
So we have run tests for everything
and according to these results...

02:42.246 --> 02:45.624
Everything seems
to have come back negative.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.753
Which doesn't necessarily mean
that Clarabelle is a failure.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.881
lt just means
that she's got to keep trying,

02:52.965 --> 02:55.843
no matter how frustrated she might get.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.263
Now, of course, if you
are lazy and incompetent,

02:59.346 --> 03:03.433
then, yes, that will buy you
a one-way ticket out of here.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.269
Doug.

03:05.352 --> 03:09.940
Listen carefully. Kelso can't do a thing
to you if you answer a question wrong.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.820
lt doesn't work that way. Moving on.
Not you. You still have work to do.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.866
Johnny No-Tan? l'd like you to
present the next patient to me.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.078
l love you.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.872
Now say it in Spanish.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.748
<i>Te amo.</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:29.543
Now... say it like Astro.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.712
l ruv roo.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.011
- You are very, very cute.
- l know.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.139
l've been thinking
about this ''l love you'' thing.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.017
lt's gonna make
everything so much better.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.812
l mean, we're so in sync.
Better conversation,

03:48.896 --> 03:51.231
better dancing...

03:52.566 --> 03:54.151
And?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.320
Way better shrumpdown.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.991
Yeah!

04:15.631 --> 04:20.177
l'm so sorry. That has never
happened to me before.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.849
<i>Man, she's beautiful.</i>

04:25.933 --> 04:29.561
<i>I wish I was that piece of bacon.
Wait a second.</i>

04:29.645 --> 04:31.188
<i>I am that piece of bacon.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:33.065
That's right.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.652
You mind not staring at me
while l'm eating?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.320
l hate it.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.822
- But l'm not.
- What am l doing right now?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.033
- Eating.
- What are you doing?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.285
Staring.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.126
There. Now no one gets to eat it.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.046
- You happy?
- Not really.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.721
You know what's great?

05:04.805 --> 05:08.141
Even when our dates get interrupted,
we can have a date here.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.978
Let's say
you wanted to watch a movie.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.898
We could go to the conference room
and watch that video on STDs.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.484
lt's funny and it makes you think.

05:17.568 --> 05:21.321
Maybe it would be good
if we actually had a date that

05:21.405 --> 05:24.867
- ends.
- How does a date with you end?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.244
lt can range from a kiss at the door

05:27.327 --> 05:31.206
to ''all l have for breakfast
is yoghurt and l'm out of bowls,

05:31.290 --> 05:34.251
so you'll have to eat off my stomach.''

05:34.334 --> 05:36.879
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.506
lt's a date.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.929
Judging from the ataxia dysarthria,

05:46.013 --> 05:50.100
l've concluded that Mr Yeager
is suffering from... kuru.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.935
- Kuru?
- Kuru.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.812
- Kuru?
- Yes, kuru.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.940
- l'd actually never thought of that.
- Hell, yeah.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.319
Were you aware that the only
documented cases of kuru

06:00.402 --> 06:03.572
were members of a cannibalistic tribe
in Papua New Guinea?

06:03.655 --> 06:06.283
- l was not.
- Actually, doc,

06:06.366 --> 06:08.410
l was in New Guinea last week.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.038
- Really?
- No.

06:11.121 --> 06:15.626
- Do you happen to know what a zebra is?
- He just mocked me.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.837
lt's a diagnosis of an obscure disease

06:18.921 --> 06:24.259
when it's more likely to be a common
illness with uncommon symptoms.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.471
ln other words,
if you hear hoof beats,

06:27.554 --> 06:31.725
you just go ahead
and think horsies, not zebras.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.977
Mm-kay, Mr Silly Bear?

06:39.983 --> 06:42.069
- What's wrong?
- lt's personal.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.738
Why won't you ever open up to me?
l came to you

06:44.821 --> 06:49.159
when l thought l had a broken tailbone
and it was just a really bad pimple.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.328
lt's a sex thing. OK?

06:52.287 --> 06:57.751
Like a gender issue or like intercourse?
Because l'm book-smart on both.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.381
Carla? Use me.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.304
- Last night, when l was with Carla...
- Dude, l can't talk.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.974
l gotta figure this Mr Yeager thing out.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.559
Cool.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.187
My horse didn't finish the race.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.357
l'm at the filling station,
but my credit card's declined.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.401
- l'm on the jet ski...
- l got it!

07:22.484 --> 07:26.488
- Good. l had no idea what to say...
- No. Mr Yeager.

07:26.572 --> 07:30.576
Where you go...?
Who am l going to talk to about sex?

07:30.659 --> 07:32.578
Let's get our talk on.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.998
Player to player.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.710
<i>Afternoon rounds
that day began like any other.</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:44.840
This patient is hypoglycaemic. What
are the signs of an insulinoma, Dr Reid?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.592
Elevated C-peptide levels.

07:46.675 --> 07:50.345
Score! But before you do
your crazy end-zone dance,

07:50.429 --> 07:53.849
tell me the spinal fluid findings
in Guillaume-BarrÃ© syndrome.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.518
- Xanthochromia?
- Wrong!

07:56.602 --> 08:01.106
<i>And then it happened. Suddenly,
Dr Kelso didn't seem as frightening.</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:05.027
Dr Reid, what do you
have to say for yourself?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.154
Win some, lose some.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.116
<i>In fact, nothing he did
seemed to scare us.</i>

08:13.535 --> 08:15.245
<i>Not any more.</i>

08:18.040 --> 08:21.251
<i>Not even the most horrible thing
he could think of.</i>

08:25.088 --> 08:28.467
All right, welcome to the lCU!
No, really, sit down.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.429
For women that don't know how to cook.
l put the Yellow Pages in there.

08:32.513 --> 08:36.808
What do you want? Mexican? ltalian?
Japanese? American cuisine?

08:36.892 --> 08:40.187
lt's a cook...
l'm flat-linin'. Beep!

08:41.813 --> 08:43.315
Save him!

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
Tip your nurses.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.989
<i>And I think he knew
who was behind it.</i>

08:52.741 --> 08:55.285
Cox.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.373
<i>Talk to me</i>

09:02.459 --> 09:05.712
You know,
that's really getting annoying.

09:05.796 --> 09:09.925
Every time you say it, it makes me
not want to talk to you all the more.

09:12.261 --> 09:15.222
<i>Talk to me</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.307
All right, fine!

09:21.854 --> 09:25.732
Last night, Turk and l were,
you know, messin' around.

09:25.816 --> 09:30.487
- lt's really hot, like always.
- Hot like how? Describe it.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.573
Dude!

09:32.656 --> 09:36.910
So suddenly, things aren't happening.
You know what l mean?

09:36.994 --> 09:41.039
The only change is that we said
''l love you'' to each other.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.541
lt's true.

09:42.624 --> 09:46.920
l have never said ''l love you''
to a woman before.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.214
Then how do you
get them to sleep with you?

09:49.298 --> 09:53.635
lt's three little words.
lt shouldn't have this effect, right?

09:53.719 --> 09:59.224
Anyway, l told him it wasn't his fault.
These things happen occasionally.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.393
Try constantly.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.980
l have cold hands, and...

10:06.607 --> 10:10.652
So when l saw you this morning
and l said ''How's your penis?''

10:10.736 --> 10:13.113
and you didn't wanna talk about it...

10:14.990 --> 10:17.618
Dude. lt's not me.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.786
lt's me.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.165
Last night, for the first time
ever in our relationship,

10:23.248 --> 10:25.167
no matter how long we tried,

10:25.250 --> 10:27.794
l was unable to have an...

10:35.886 --> 10:40.098
Dr Cox, l got the sed rate back
on Mr Yeager. Say ''how do'' to that.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.643
But then
l'm due back at the hootenanny.

10:42.726 --> 10:46.605
l noticed he had a rash. l realised
he's been having jaw claudication,

10:46.688 --> 10:49.274
- which led me to...
- Temporal arteritis.

10:49.358 --> 10:54.488
Of course. Nurse, start Mr Yeager on
solumedrol and get the surgery resident?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.949
He needs a temporal
artery biopsy stat.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.326
Newbie, l can handle this.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.745
- You're off, aren't you?
- l'm with you.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.623
Fair enough.
Let's go treat the patient.

11:04.706 --> 11:08.252
<i>I am so on top of things tonight,
it's scary.</i>

11:14.967 --> 11:16.969
Hell, yeah.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.307
<i>You're only 80 minutes late.
She'll still be here.</i>

11:22.391 --> 11:24.142
<i>Please be here. Come on, Alex.</i>

11:24.226 --> 11:27.020
<i>Please be here.</i>

11:29.398 --> 11:31.692
You gotta be kidding me.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.361
There's a waste of a gift certificate.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.530
Cancel the cobbler!

11:37.489 --> 11:39.908
She's not having an orgasm.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.662
Still not seeing what the problem is.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.836
l've never even had an orgasm.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.426
l'm sorry.
l should be more surprised.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.511
That'd be nice.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.767
- l want to talk to you about rounds.
- Here we go. Bring it on.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.353
They're all yours.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.815
You will be leading them from now on.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.444
You've stunned me, but you
haven't dropped me to the mat.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.281
Waiting for the roundhouse here.
The old haymaker,

12:19.364 --> 12:22.409
when the yelling starts
and the voice gets high-pitched.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.454
''Daddy, l've been bad.
Daddy, l've been a bad boy.''

12:25.537 --> 12:29.166
''Oh, Daddy!
Daddy, l've been bad.''

12:30.292 --> 12:33.045
lf you're not gonna play, it's no fun.

12:34.546 --> 12:38.842
Hey, Alex, l am so sorry. l went
to the restaurant but just missed you.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.178
Then l called, but there was no answer,

12:41.261 --> 12:45.349
then l stopped by, and l guess
you didn't see me which was odd,

12:45.432 --> 12:49.895
cos l was standing next to
the pizza guy while you were paying him.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.066
We're still cool, right?

12:54.816 --> 12:59.321
- Look, JD...
- ''Look, JD, we're still great?''

13:00.739 --> 13:04.368
l think you're a really good guy.
OK? But...

13:04.451 --> 13:07.746
- Alex dumped me.
- The blind girl you've been dating?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.915
- She's not blind.
- Of course not.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.918
How'd you drop the ball?
Don't tell me you cried,

13:13.001 --> 13:15.337
or l'll ban you
from the men's room again.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.008
l was so excited what we were
doing here, l forgot about our date.

13:20.926 --> 13:26.056
<i>You didn't forget. You kept looking
at your watch. I saw you.</i>

13:26.139 --> 13:29.810
<i>l assumed that you were
afraid of missing Judging Amy.</i>

13:29.893 --> 13:32.521
lt never occurred to me
you were choosing work

13:32.604 --> 13:36.275
over being with
that sweet little biscuit.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.360
That means a lot coming from you,

13:38.443 --> 13:41.572
Mr Right-here-with-me
two-hours-after-his-shift-

13:41.655 --> 13:45.033
and-last-Monday-night-too... guy.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.619
- What?
- You heard me.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.455
Newbie, what're you saying?

13:50.539 --> 13:53.083
That you want to be like me?

13:55.377 --> 13:59.256
Do you understand that
l just barely want to be like me?

14:08.682 --> 14:12.060
l can't even pretend
l can give you tips on intercourse.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.771
l got one for you.
Stop calling it that.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.901
My therapist thinks my trouble in bed
stems from a fear of intimacy,

14:18.984 --> 14:23.322
but l think it's because any type
of repetitive motion makes me nauseous.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.784
And since l was a kid,
l've had nightmares about being crushed.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.120
That poor shrink.

14:30.204 --> 14:34.625
The one thing l do know is that
l've sabotaged a lot of relationships

14:34.708 --> 14:38.587
by never talking things out
with the guy that l'm seeing.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.466
- Thanks.
- Sure.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.722
So...
You've really never had...

14:48.805 --> 14:50.766
No.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.394
- Not even by yourself?
- Gross.

14:56.355 --> 14:59.024
ls it easy?

15:00.025 --> 15:02.194
When's your next laundry night?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.112
Ted.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.157
l need you to take care
of some lawyer crap for me.

15:07.241 --> 15:13.664
lt'd be great if you would go to traffic
court for me and make this go away.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.750
l don't think so.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.545
Excuse me?

15:19.628 --> 15:25.008
No, Bob! l have my own things
l need to take care of.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.845
Of course.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.391
Walk off, bitch.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.477
How is it, exactly,
that you just said that

15:35.561 --> 15:37.980
and your pants are still dry?

15:38.063 --> 15:40.566
Don't you understand

15:40.649 --> 15:43.819
what you did
when you spoke to those interns?

15:43.902 --> 15:47.406
You took away the fear.

15:47.489 --> 15:51.493
You...
are a wonderful person,

15:52.995 --> 15:55.497
and... l love you.

16:02.421 --> 16:06.383
<i>I have to ask Alex
for another chance. I have to.</i>

16:06.466 --> 16:10.762
<i>OK, she's with a hot guy. Stay calm.
She's gonna be psyched to see you.</i>

16:10.846 --> 16:13.182
JD. Hey.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.683
<i>Or not.</i>

16:14.766 --> 16:18.812
l don't prioritise you over my job,
but l'd like to.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.190
l wanted to be a doctor for so long,

16:21.273 --> 16:24.026
l sort of forgot
how to want anything else.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.528
And now l meet you, and...

16:27.446 --> 16:31.158
l'll do anything in the world
if you give me a second chance.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.536
l'm sorry.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.292
l'll leave you guys alone.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.547
OK, Rowdy,

16:45.631 --> 16:47.799
fetch!

16:47.883 --> 16:49.885
Hey, sweetie?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.429
- We have to talk.
- No time for talk.

16:52.513 --> 16:55.057
We have a problem
we need to take care of.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.726
Why are you wearing
a nose-breathing thingy?

16:57.809 --> 17:01.396
Baby, bear with me.
l got big ideas.

17:02.439 --> 17:06.151
l've been having all these
thoughts going through my head,

17:06.234 --> 17:08.779
and l'm afraid if l tell you,
l'd scare you away.

17:08.862 --> 17:14.117
That's the last thing that l wanna...
Take that damn thing off.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.869
Oh, God.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.876
Baby, there's nothing
that could scare me away.

17:25.921 --> 17:29.675
Since we said ''l love you'',
l've been feeling all this pressure.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.427
And wondering about the future.
Our future.

17:32.511 --> 17:35.305
Are we gonna get married?
Are we gonna have kids?

17:35.389 --> 17:37.766
lf so, when will l get my figure back?

17:37.850 --> 17:42.104
Where are we gonna live? Will my mother
live with us? How big a house?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.606
How many bathrooms?
What if she walks in on you

17:44.690 --> 17:49.611
while you're in the bathroom, you fall,
and l can't afford the funeral costs?

17:49.695 --> 17:52.865
That's a little scary.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.493
l guess l just need to know
you think about that stuff too.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.203
Carla?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.876
No, l don't.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.214
- But l love it that you do.
- Yeah?

18:09.298 --> 18:12.050
That's what
makes this relationship work.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.053
We're so different.
l keep us in the present,

18:15.137 --> 18:18.015
you look out for what's up ahead.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.645
Besides, there is no way in hell

18:23.729 --> 18:26.356
your mother's ever
going to live with us.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.443
lf she ever walks in on me
while l'm in the bathroom,

18:29.526 --> 18:31.904
she's getting a trip to Florida.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.072
- No, she's not.
- l'm tell...

18:36.241 --> 18:39.828
Ladies and germs,
if you get this shorthand down,

18:39.912 --> 18:42.539
it has a way of making your day
go quicker.

18:42.623 --> 18:46.043
''CTD'' being ''circling the drain.''
Your patient is on the way out.

18:46.126 --> 18:50.214
''SOB'', ''shortness of breath''
and ''WNL'', ''within normal limits''.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.382
Elvis, feel free to write this down,

18:52.466 --> 18:55.844
any time before
you leave the building.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.722
- You paged me?
- l didn't page you.

18:58.805 --> 19:03.393
<i>And that's when Dr Cox started
poking the old bear with a stick.</i>

19:03.477 --> 19:05.604
l'm sick
of the grill 'em and drill 'em.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.232
What do you say
we shake things up?

19:08.315 --> 19:13.487
You kids ask me the questions,
and l'll just give you the answers.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.698
Dr Cox, could l talk to you?

19:16.782 --> 19:21.286
Sure, Bob, but you have to raise
your hand like all the other children.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.748
- l just think it's inappropriate...
- Bob-o?

19:24.832 --> 19:27.417
Now, you've got five
good ones right there.

19:27.501 --> 19:32.422
What do you say you put 'em up
in the air like you just don't care?

19:32.506 --> 19:34.716
Get over here, right now.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.012
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and
didn't wanna take the one thing he had.</i>

19:39.096 --> 19:42.349
<i>Maybe he just hated rounds.</i>

19:42.432 --> 19:44.518
Get the hell outta my lCU!

19:44.601 --> 19:47.145
<i>But if you didn't
know Dr Cox like I did,</i>

19:47.229 --> 19:50.691
<i>you would've believed
his performance too.</i>

19:50.774 --> 19:54.361
<i>I guess the key
to a lot of things is balance.</i>

19:54.444 --> 19:56.905
<i>Whether it's balance of power...</i>

19:58.574 --> 20:00.325
Dr Simotas, stop smiling.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.205
l hate smiling.

20:06.665 --> 20:08.667
<i>...balance in love...</i>

20:11.086 --> 20:12.588
<i>...or sometimes...</i>

20:14.089 --> 20:15.507
<i>...just balance.</i>

20:20.095 --> 20:22.848
<i>For some of us,
it seems too far out of reach.</i>

20:37.154 --> 20:39.865
<i>Too difficult to achieve.</i>

21:17.069 --> 21:20.364
<i>But the important thing
is just to never stop trying.</i>

21:22.699 --> 21:25.744
<i>Especially if you
like girls named Alex.</i>

21:25.828 --> 21:28.121
<i>And chicken salad.</i>
