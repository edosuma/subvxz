Mr. Harris, what brings you out here?

05:11.600 --> 05:15.536
I figured I'd come out here after the bank
closed and discuss a few things with you.

05:15.637 --> 05:18.071
Now, as you both know,
you've fallen behind...

05:18.173 --> 05:20.641

that you took out with the bank.

05:20.742 --> 05:22.676
Yes, sir, we're aware
we're a few payments behind...

that when the weather shifts...

We would much prefer to make
those payments on time.

I trust that is the truth,
but l can't be leaving it for any longer.

05:36.691 --> 05:39.717
Now, make the payments or the bank
will be forced to seize your land.

05:39.828 --> 05:42.695
- Mr. Harris, please understand-
- There's nothing to understand.

05:42.797 --> 05:44.765
You signed a loan, which clearly states...

that you would make
the agreed upon payments every month.

07:01.743 --> 07:03.768
When l took that loan...

l just assumed it was gonna rain
and things were gonna turn around.

16:23.871 --> 16:26.431
I do love you so.

16:26.541 --> 16:28.532
I love you too.

16:28.643 --> 16:31.009
- Go back to sleep.
- Mmm.

16:41.756 --> 16:45.590
Son, why didn't you tell us
you were having trouble with the land?

16:45.693 --> 16:48.127
A man's gotta stand on his own.

16:48.229 --> 16:50.254
I didn't wanna come begging for help.

16:50.364 --> 16:53.959
Yep, a man does have to go off and...

16:54.068 --> 16:56.866
find his way, make his own life.

16:56.971 --> 16:59.633
But he shouldn't forget where he come from.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.072
I didn't want you to think
l couldn't take care of my family.

17:02.176 --> 17:03.768
Son, l would never.

17:05.579 --> 17:09.277
- So, how long has this well been dry anyway?
- It's been a spell.

17:09.383 --> 17:13.319
Just had enough for the garden
and the animals from the creek.

17:13.421 --> 17:16.913
But... it's been
barely enough to sustain us.

17:17.023 --> 17:20.425
Well, have you tried
digging a little deeper into the well?

17:22.096 --> 17:25.122
Yes, sir, but... l hit rock.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.498
Yeah, well, l noticed you, uh...

17:28.603 --> 17:31.766
you dug another one out in the field
in front of the house.

17:31.873 --> 17:35.240
- Yes, sir, same problem.
- Well, l think l may know of a way...

17:35.343 --> 17:39.143
to get you some water without having
to dig wells all over creation.

17:40.681 --> 17:43.673
Your old man knows a thing or two
about dealing with a drought.

17:44.619 --> 17:49.113
What do you think, hmm?

17:50.224 --> 17:52.784
Oh, it's beautiful.

17:52.894 --> 17:55.419
You are truly an artist.

17:55.529 --> 17:56.962
Why, thank you.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.693
- Can l ask you something, Sarah?
- Certainly.

18:02.803 --> 18:06.830
- Your husband, he passed on a couple of years back.
- Yes.

18:06.941 --> 18:09.068
He's still in your heart?

18:10.111 --> 18:13.444
He will always be in my heart.

18:15.049 --> 18:17.017
What l meant was...

18:17.118 --> 18:19.678
do you ever see yourself
with somebody else?

18:19.787 --> 18:21.778
Remarrying, l mean?

18:22.957 --> 18:25.118
At first l didn't.

18:25.226 --> 18:28.195
No, the pain was so strong.

18:28.296 --> 18:30.730
I couldn't imagine a time...

18:30.831 --> 18:34.267
when l could be open to someone else.

18:34.368 --> 18:37.997
But time has a way of changing things
without you knowing.

18:38.105 --> 18:41.666
[ Laughs ]
it took some time, but, uh...

18:41.776 --> 18:45.678
l think the Lord has allowed
my aching heart to heal.

18:48.916 --> 18:51.544
Ben Graham lost his wife.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.018
He's a good man, a good father.

18:55.923 --> 18:59.689
And he is a rather
handsome man, l must say.

19:03.264 --> 19:07.496
So you said your well is,
what, about 25 feet?

19:07.601 --> 19:11.002
Well, l was able to dig five more,
but then l ended up hitting rock.

19:11.105 --> 19:14.541
All right, so that's about 30.

19:14.642 --> 19:20.103
I figure, uh, this land
being more elevated like it is...

19:20.214 --> 19:22.910
we'll have to go down about 40, 45 feet...

19:23.017 --> 19:25.076
in order to even have a
hope of hittin' water.

19:25.186 --> 19:26.710
That deep, huh?

19:26.821 --> 19:28.721
Well, let's get to it.

19:28.823 --> 19:30.381
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

19:31.459 --> 19:33.757
[ Both Grunting ]

19:33.861 --> 19:37.319
So, how's that neighbor of yours, Ben?

19:37.431 --> 19:39.592
- He having a tough time of it too?
- Well...

19:39.700 --> 19:42.225
- the drought hit him pretty hard, but...
- Yeah?

19:42.336 --> 19:44.270
Somehow he was able to hit water though.

19:45.539 --> 19:47.234
Well, we will too.

19:47.341 --> 19:49.571
- l hope so.
- [ Grunts ]

19:49.677 --> 19:52.202

- Bye, Sarah.
- Evening, Ellen.

- Really?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.824
Yes. Be making payment on Friday.

20:08.929 --> 20:11.659
I heard about your job
over here at Mr. Connor's.

20:17.938 --> 20:20.168
I'm fine. It's just this dry weather.

20:20.274 --> 20:23.300
Ah. Well, evenin'.

- Good night, Ma.

20:51.672 --> 20:54.004
What time in the morning
do you want me out here?

20:54.108 --> 20:56.576
- l think Ben's gonna be over around 7:30.
- All right.

20:56.677 --> 21:00.044
- See if Ben and the boys wanna come
to supper on Saturday. - I will.

21:00.147 --> 21:03.275
- l could help you with that if you'd like.
- That would be wonderful, lrene.

21:03.384 --> 21:04.783
I could help with the eating of it.

21:04.885 --> 21:06.853
Now, there's something you're good at.

21:06.954 --> 21:10.481
If y'all excuse me,
I'm feeling a bit tired. I'm gonna turn in.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.327
If you're so tired, maybe you shouldn't
be working at that tailor shop.

21:16.430 --> 21:19.490
No, I'll be fine, really.
It's just gonna take some getting used to, is all.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.367
- You look pale.
- Really, I'm fine. I just need some rest.

21:24.472 --> 21:26.667
We should be going. Uh, it's getting late.

21:26.774 --> 21:29.971
We got a long ways back to town.
Good night, sweetheart.

Ma.

21:45.493 --> 21:48.121
[ Ben ] it was mighty nice of Ellen
inviting us over for dinner Saturday.

21:48.229 --> 21:50.288
I haven't had
a good home-cooked meal in a while.

21:50.397 --> 21:52.797
Except the ones l cook.
I'm not sure how good those are.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.095
[ Laughs ] So I've heard.

21:55.202 --> 21:58.399
- Ben, l appreciate you coming out here.
- It's in my own best interest.

21:58.506 --> 22:01.600
I think l might try this out in my far
field before l start digging another well.

22:01.709 --> 22:03.370
Whew!

22:03.477 --> 22:07.004
- How's Ellen doing working?
- She seems a little tired.

22:07.114 --> 22:09.742
Well, then you make her stay home
till she feels better.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.477
Oh, she won't do that.

22:11.585 --> 22:14.247
I learned a long time ago
l can't tell Ellen what to do.

22:14.355 --> 22:17.085
Well, as long as she ain't too tired
to cook dinner on Saturday.

22:17.191 --> 22:19.682

That was mighty kind of you.

22:19.793 --> 22:21.727
Well, I'm just saying
I'm looking forward to that dinner.

Will you two stop clucking away
like a couple of hens?

22:24.832 --> 22:27.096
We got work to do here.

22:31.772 --> 22:34.172
I invited someone else.

22:34.275 --> 22:37.073
- Who?
- Sarah and her young'uns.

22:37.178 --> 22:39.976
Thought it'd be nice for them to play
with Missy and Ben's boys.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.277
Sure you did.
I thought we talked about that, Ellen.

22:43.384 --> 22:45.477
We did. I just didn't agree to anything.

22:45.586 --> 22:47.781
I guess you didn't.
