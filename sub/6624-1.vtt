01:04.179 --> 01:05.737
- Is he here yet?
- No.

01:05.947 --> 01:10.008
- You scared him.
- I gotta take a massive piss.

01:10.218 --> 01:13.779
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

01:29.371 --> 01:31.032
Anyone got any beer?

01:31.239 --> 01:36.267
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

01:36.478 --> 01:40.346
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

01:40.549 --> 01:44.986
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

01:45.187 --> 01:47.849
- Thanks a lot, Eric.
- Anytime, anywhere.

01:48.056 --> 01:51.992
- This is gonna be sweet.
- I'm glad I thought of it.

01:52.194 --> 01:54.754
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

01:54.963 --> 01:58.797
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.198
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

02:04.673 --> 02:07.938
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

02:08.143 --> 02:12.307
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

02:13.181 --> 02:15.706
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

02:15.917 --> 02:17.817
You know I don't dance.

02:18.019 --> 02:21.682
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

02:21.890 --> 02:26.190
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

02:26.395 --> 02:28.761
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

02:28.964 --> 02:31.364
Like yourself.

02:31.566 --> 02:32.828
He's here!

02:33.034 --> 02:35.628
All right, here he comes.

02:36.772 --> 02:39.798
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

02:40.008 --> 02:43.375
I can't wait to see you fly!

02:49.384 --> 02:51.909
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.220
You're late.

02:57.426 --> 03:01.089
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know...

03:01.296 --> 03:06.199
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

03:08.270 --> 03:11.137
If there is a next time!

03:13.875 --> 03:16.810
Dean! Is he always like that?

03:17.012 --> 03:20.971
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

03:21.183 --> 03:23.708
Wait up, baby!

03:25.720 --> 03:31.022
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

03:53.648 --> 03:55.548
Okay, here's the deal.

03:55.750 --> 03:59.345
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

03:59.554 --> 04:02.148
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

04:02.357 --> 04:04.587
- You ready?
- Yeah.

04:04.793 --> 04:07.557
All right. All right.

04:08.263 --> 04:10.322
Let's do this, okay?

04:16.370 --> 04:19.807
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

04:20.976 --> 04:23.968
- How deep is this?
- I don't really know.

04:24.179 --> 04:25.737
Let's go find out.

04:28.116 --> 04:30.641
Let's do it.

04:59.414 --> 05:01.245
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

05:03.285 --> 05:05.879
Come on, let's go!

05:06.288 --> 05:07.550
Jump!

05:10.525 --> 05:13.085
- You done this?
- We've all done it.

05:13.295 --> 05:18.426
- I hope you had your Wheaties!
- You guys gonna do this tonight?

05:18.633 --> 05:20.533
On three.

05:21.269 --> 05:22.759
One.

05:22.971 --> 05:24.666
Two.

05:24.873 --> 05:26.135
Three!

05:43.758 --> 05:45.089
Oh, shit.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.653
Landon, he's hurt!

05:47.862 --> 05:50.160
- Is he okay?
- Landon, get down here!

05:50.365 --> 05:52.629
- What the hell?
- Dean, what the hell?

05:52.834 --> 05:55.200
- You guys, he's hurt!
- Come on, man!

05:55.403 --> 05:59.863
- I told you it was a bad idea!
- Get him out of the water!

06:00.342 --> 06:05.211
- Hurry up!
- Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

06:05.847 --> 06:07.838
Help me!

06:09.551 --> 06:14.250
- Get him over here!
- There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

06:15.090 --> 06:17.524
Get him out of the water!

06:17.726 --> 06:20.456
Watch his head! Watch his head!

06:22.197 --> 06:24.028
Hey, who's down there?

06:24.232 --> 06:26.496
Tracie, come on!

06:28.069 --> 06:31.402
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

06:31.606 --> 06:33.597
Come on, Landon.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.372
Come on!

06:36.578 --> 06:38.603
You guys, just take him!

06:38.813 --> 06:40.804
Give me his arms!

06:41.416 --> 06:42.883
I got him.

06:46.287 --> 06:48.687
We gotta get out of here.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.624
- Go! Get out of here!
- Landon, come on!

06:55.797 --> 06:58.493
I told you not to do this!

06:58.700 --> 07:00.224
Calm down.

07:04.539 --> 07:06.507
Belinda, let's go!

07:08.843 --> 07:11.107
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

07:33.234 --> 07:34.633
Damn it!

07:57.592 --> 07:58.957
Shit!

08:26.020 --> 08:28.488
Put your hands on the wheel.

08:59.587 --> 09:02.112
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

09:02.323 --> 09:05.019
I don't think I can go anyplace.

09:06.294 --> 09:10.253
- Maybe I should call your father.
- No.

09:10.865 --> 09:12.730
I'm not talking to him.

09:12.934 --> 09:18.634
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

09:20.642 --> 09:25.238
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.782
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

09:29.984 --> 09:33.818
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

11:13.354 --> 11:16.346
- So how's the leg, man?
- It's good.

11:16.557 --> 11:18.752
I can't believe you were in jail.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.521
- What'd you tell them?
- It was a nice night for a drive.

11:22.730 --> 11:26.131
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

11:26.334 --> 11:28.461
Tried to help him, got spooked.

11:28.670 --> 11:32.128
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

11:32.340 --> 11:36.674
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

11:36.878 --> 11:40.177
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

11:40.381 --> 11:42.679
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

11:42.884 --> 11:45.444
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

11:45.653 --> 11:48.645
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

11:48.856 --> 11:52.383
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

11:52.593 --> 11:54.356
Nice sweater.

11:54.562 --> 11:56.427
Thank you.

12:03.805 --> 12:05.568
Thank you.

12:19.220 --> 12:22.485
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

12:22.690 --> 12:25.352
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

12:25.560 --> 12:30.520
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

12:30.732 --> 12:33.599
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

12:33.801 --> 12:35.792
What, are you gonna expel me?

12:36.304 --> 12:37.737
Not yet.

12:39.173 --> 12:44.236
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

12:44.445 --> 12:47.903
- For pay?
- For the inner satisfaction it brings.

12:48.916 --> 12:52.545
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

12:52.754 --> 12:56.019
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

12:56.224 --> 12:58.522
The spring play?

13:00.194 --> 13:02.594
It's time you experienced
other things.

13:02.797 --> 13:06.699
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

13:06.934 --> 13:09.027
Don't blow it, Landon.

13:14.642 --> 13:20.239
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

13:20.448 --> 13:24.248
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

13:27.588 --> 13:29.283
This is a star frame.

13:29.490 --> 13:32.789
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

13:32.994 --> 13:38.899
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.627
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

13:42.804 --> 13:45.671
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

13:45.873 --> 13:50.537
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

13:50.978 --> 13:54.038
Well, if there is a higher power...

13:54.215 --> 13:56.843
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

13:57.151 --> 13:59.711
He's too busy looking for your brain.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.055
Laugh, it's a joke.

14:04.258 --> 14:06.988
- Let's get out of here.
- I gotta stay.

14:07.195 --> 14:10.426
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

14:10.865 --> 14:12.730
Come on. Come on.

14:12.934 --> 14:16.563
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

14:16.771 --> 14:19.831
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

14:24.412 --> 14:27.381
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

14:30.952 --> 14:33.750
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

14:33.955 --> 14:37.186
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

14:38.826 --> 14:41.727
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

14:42.396 --> 14:44.990
I know. I just thought...

14:45.199 --> 14:46.757
It's over.

14:47.735 --> 14:50.863
Yeah. Whatever.

15:01.215 --> 15:03.080
Okay.

15:08.222 --> 15:10.190
Good morning, Landon.

15:10.391 --> 15:12.951
Landon, wake up!

15:13.161 --> 15:15.994
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

15:17.431 --> 15:18.728
Up!

15:18.933 --> 15:20.833
It's Saturday, no school.

15:22.570 --> 15:23.901
Tutoring.

15:42.456 --> 15:44.617
Let's try this again.

15:44.992 --> 15:49.122
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

15:49.463 --> 15:51.328
What do you think?

15:51.732 --> 15:54.394
Man, I think this is bullshit!

15:57.672 --> 15:59.902
Makes two of us.

16:23.431 --> 16:25.956
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

16:26.167 --> 16:30.194
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

16:30.404 --> 16:32.167
No.

16:34.742 --> 16:37.905
So I saw you in there with Luis.

16:38.212 --> 16:40.703
And I know it can be difficult...

16:40.915 --> 16:44.510
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

16:49.123 --> 16:52.251
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

16:55.496 --> 16:57.726
That would be a no.

16:59.100 --> 17:02.501
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

17:02.703 --> 17:05.604
Is this your idea of small talk?

17:05.806 --> 17:09.571
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.574
- It's called peer pressure.
- How do you know?

17:12.780 --> 17:15.044
You read it in your precious book?

17:19.619 --> 17:23.112
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

17:23.324 --> 17:26.259
But I do. I do.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.759
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

17:29.964 --> 17:33.798
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

17:34.001 --> 17:38.768
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

17:38.973 --> 17:43.569
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

17:43.778 --> 17:46.303
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

17:46.514 --> 17:49.210
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

17:49.417 --> 17:50.975
How's that sound?

17:52.086 --> 17:56.955
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

17:57.158 --> 18:01.390
- You don't care what people think?
- No.

18:29.890 --> 18:34.122
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

18:34.328 --> 18:37.957
This is bullshit. Thanks.

18:38.165 --> 18:42.363
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

18:42.570 --> 18:46.336
- Be back in an hour.
- Tell them to do West Side Story.

18:46.540 --> 18:52.672
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

18:52.880 --> 18:58.011
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

18:58.219 --> 19:03.521
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

19:03.858 --> 19:09.319
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

19:09.530 --> 19:10.963
Eddie, perhaps...

19:11.165 --> 19:14.726
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

19:14.935 --> 19:16.698
Sure.

19:19.039 --> 19:21.064
Now then, let's see...

19:22.376 --> 19:27.006
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

19:27.181 --> 19:31.242
- Sally will be playing Caroline.
- Congratulations.

19:31.452 --> 19:34.615
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

19:35.956 --> 19:40.586
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

19:40.795 --> 19:43.286
When did you know, Tommy?

19:44.665 --> 19:45.927
IKnow what?

19:46.133 --> 19:48.499
That we were in love.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.004
Love?

19:53.707 --> 19:58.235
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

19:58.446 --> 20:01.108
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

20:01.315 --> 20:05.911
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

20:08.189 --> 20:13.388
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

20:13.594 --> 20:15.755
...pour me another glass.

20:15.963 --> 20:18.727
Are you trying to be bad at this?

20:18.933 --> 20:22.096
No, just comes naturally.

20:23.204 --> 20:27.334
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

20:31.779 --> 20:34.612
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

20:34.815 --> 20:38.717
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. See you.

20:41.956 --> 20:43.514
Bye.

20:50.364 --> 20:55.563
- So would it kill you to try?
- Yep, and I'm too young to die.

20:55.736 --> 20:58.933
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

20:59.139 --> 21:02.870
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

21:03.077 --> 21:08.413
- That's thoroughly predictable.
- Your act only works on an audience.

21:40.748 --> 21:42.113
Feeling Christian?

21:42.950 --> 21:45.009
Seat belt?

22:05.539 --> 22:08.508
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

22:08.709 --> 22:10.973
Forty-two.

22:11.445 --> 22:13.310
What do you mean, forty-two?

22:13.514 --> 22:16.677
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

22:18.819 --> 22:21.913
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

22:22.122 --> 22:24.147
Like getting a new personality?

22:24.358 --> 22:27.327
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

22:27.528 --> 22:28.517
Ambitious.

22:28.729 --> 22:32.426
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

22:34.168 --> 22:36.193
What's number one?

22:37.871 --> 22:41.967
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

22:57.157 --> 22:57.987
I've come...

22:58.258 --> 22:59.555
...to see if you're ready.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.696
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

23:03.897 --> 23:06.730
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

23:06.934 --> 23:11.064
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

23:11.572 --> 23:14.063
When you walked into...

23:15.843 --> 23:21.008
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

23:21.215 --> 23:23.308
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

23:23.517 --> 23:27.146
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

23:27.354 --> 23:30.721
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

23:30.924 --> 23:33.586
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

23:33.861 --> 23:37.763
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

23:37.965 --> 23:42.459
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

23:42.670 --> 23:44.262
I didn't write it, okay?

23:44.471 --> 23:49.067
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

23:49.276 --> 23:53.679
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

23:55.816 --> 23:57.909
I'm just busting on you.

23:58.118 --> 24:03.249
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

24:03.457 --> 24:05.789
With tomatoes.

24:06.293 --> 24:07.988
Thanks, man.

24:08.195 --> 24:11.926
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

24:12.132 --> 24:14.100
- Yeah.
- No problem.

24:22.743 --> 24:24.472
Jamie.

24:25.979 --> 24:27.537
What do you want?

24:27.748 --> 24:32.481
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

24:33.554 --> 24:36.182
I need help with my lines.

24:37.624 --> 24:41.890
- Landon Carter's asking me for help?
- Yeah.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.894
Okay, I'll pray for you.

24:45.632 --> 24:47.099
Jamie, look...

24:47.301 --> 24:51.635
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

24:51.839 --> 24:56.776
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

24:56.977 --> 25:00.469
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

25:00.681 --> 25:05.482
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

25:06.754 --> 25:10.417
- Please?
- Okay. One condition, though.

25:10.657 --> 25:12.284
What's that?

25:12.493 --> 25:15.894
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

25:19.433 --> 25:24.598
- That's not a problem.
- Okay. I'll see you today after school.

25:28.542 --> 25:30.908
Landon Carter is coming here?

25:31.111 --> 25:34.342
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

25:34.548 --> 25:37.483
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

25:37.751 --> 25:41.209
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

25:41.421 --> 25:44.447
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

25:44.658 --> 25:47.889
It's him I don't trust, not you.

26:00.340 --> 26:03.138
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

26:03.744 --> 26:05.302
Come on in.

26:09.950 --> 26:14.717
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

26:14.922 --> 26:16.913
Oh, yeah.

26:17.124 --> 26:19.319
It's not likely.

26:38.045 --> 26:40.172
That is one scary-looking...

26:40.814 --> 26:43.180
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

26:44.284 --> 26:48.186
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

26:48.388 --> 26:50.117
Congratulations.

26:50.324 --> 26:53.293
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

26:53.493 --> 26:55.586
I didn't let you.

26:56.396 --> 27:01.561
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

27:01.835 --> 27:07.467
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

27:08.542 --> 27:10.669
But I see you.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.613
I'll be in my office, just here.

27:16.783 --> 27:17.772
Ready?

27:19.453 --> 27:21.717
Yeah, let's go.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.760
- Landon! Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

27:30.964 --> 27:33.762
- Hey, come here.
- What's up?

27:33.967 --> 27:37.300
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

27:56.590 --> 27:58.353
What the hell?

28:13.173 --> 28:16.734
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

28:16.944 --> 28:20.641
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

28:20.847 --> 28:22.280
Maybe.

28:22.983 --> 28:25.008
Where you going?

28:26.086 --> 28:28.054
Come and see.

28:33.961 --> 28:36.987
Okay. What is that?

28:37.197 --> 28:41.930
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

28:42.936 --> 28:45.029
Take a look.

28:49.343 --> 28:52.779
Saturn. Very cool.

28:52.980 --> 28:58.247
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

28:58.452 --> 29:02.320
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

29:02.522 --> 29:06.288
Nature's miracles. I get it.

29:06.493 --> 29:10.327
- Get what?
- That you're into all this stuff.

29:11.031 --> 29:13.056
This stuff?

29:13.266 --> 29:17.635
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

29:17.804 --> 29:21.399
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

29:21.575 --> 29:24.066
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

29:24.277 --> 29:26.939
Tell that to those who suffer.

29:29.016 --> 29:33.953
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

29:34.421 --> 29:37.652
- She's trashy.
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

29:38.325 --> 29:40.691
Here comes your leading lady.

29:40.894 --> 29:44.921
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

29:46.266 --> 29:47.961
In your dreams.

29:57.944 --> 30:01.971
Hi. Where's your sweater?

30:08.655 --> 30:11.089
Let's get out of here.

30:12.793 --> 30:14.158
What's up, dude?

30:41.054 --> 30:45.855
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

30:47.727 --> 30:49.786
What do you want?

30:49.996 --> 30:53.762
- You're not in a good mood.
- You don't miss a thing.

30:54.267 --> 30:57.964
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

30:58.205 --> 31:01.333
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

31:01.808 --> 31:06.177
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

31:06.379 --> 31:08.176
We could be secret friends.

31:08.381 --> 31:12.147
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

31:12.352 --> 31:15.788
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

31:20.460 --> 31:23.190
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

31:23.396 --> 31:28.595
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

31:28.835 --> 31:31.303
But I was very wrong.

31:37.611 --> 31:39.511
Damn it!

31:43.984 --> 31:46.953
Sorry. Sorry.

32:23.590 --> 32:25.785
You know the answer?

32:27.194 --> 32:29.628
Come on, man, I know you know.

32:37.037 --> 32:40.598
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

32:40.807 --> 32:43.367
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

32:43.577 --> 32:46.171
Take a step towards the basket.

32:48.715 --> 32:52.310
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

32:52.519 --> 32:54.316
- Yeah.
- Are you?

32:54.521 --> 32:58.150
- Yeah.
- So, what did we just make?

33:01.161 --> 33:05.689
- A similar triangle?
- Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

33:07.667 --> 33:10.966
You got it, two sides the same.

33:11.171 --> 33:13.901
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

35:24.504 --> 35:27.234
I came to say I'm sorry.

35:29.743 --> 35:33.770
Well, you did. Feel better?

35:33.947 --> 35:36.177
No. I feel like shit.

35:36.383 --> 35:41.343
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

35:44.190 --> 35:48.559
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

35:51.631 --> 35:53.394
I made that jump once.

35:53.933 --> 35:56.458
I thought I was a badass.

35:57.737 --> 36:02.868
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

36:05.512 --> 36:07.036
Did it hurt?

36:09.716 --> 36:11.650
Like hell.

36:12.719 --> 36:14.414
Good.

36:22.695 --> 36:25.425
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

36:30.303 --> 36:33.272
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

36:33.473 --> 36:36.636
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

36:36.843 --> 36:39.243
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

36:39.446 --> 36:43.212
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

36:43.383 --> 36:46.352
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

36:46.553 --> 36:49.420
That's it! We are through!

36:49.856 --> 36:52.586
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

36:52.792 --> 36:55.522
And I hope you drown in it!

36:55.728 --> 36:59.357
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

36:59.866 --> 37:02.300
The singer?

37:02.502 --> 37:07.303
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

37:07.507 --> 37:10.943
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

37:13.613 --> 37:16.707
Look, I ain't blaming you.

37:16.916 --> 37:19.646
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

37:20.753 --> 37:22.983
I just did what I had to.

37:28.328 --> 37:33.265
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

37:34.567 --> 37:37.092
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

37:37.303 --> 37:39.464
Nothing's coincidence.

37:39.672 --> 37:44.166
Your face... You look so familiar.

37:44.511 --> 37:49.073
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

37:49.315 --> 37:51.806
Tell me about this dream girl.

37:56.689 --> 38:00.648
Well, I don't remember.

38:04.631 --> 38:06.792
All I know...

38:10.603 --> 38:13.163
...is you're beautiful.

38:22.515 --> 38:24.039
The song, the song.

38:24.551 --> 38:26.485
The dream.

38:28.221 --> 38:30.519
Help me to remember.

38:31.791 --> 38:33.850
Will you sing for me?

42:39.372 --> 42:40.862
That was great.

42:46.045 --> 42:47.637
Hi, kids.

42:48.047 --> 42:52.211
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

42:52.418 --> 42:54.010
Thanks, but please stop.

42:54.187 --> 42:56.712
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thanks.

42:56.923 --> 42:59.153
Okay, okay.

43:00.026 --> 43:03.689
- Interesting rewrite you did there.
- I did my best.

43:03.896 --> 43:06.296
Your acting didn't suck either.

43:06.499 --> 43:10.094
- Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

43:10.303 --> 43:13.568
- Landon, you were marvelous!
- Thank you.

43:17.910 --> 43:20.435
Landon? Fine performance, son.

43:20.646 --> 43:24.514
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd get a bite.

43:24.717 --> 43:26.912
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't walk away.

43:27.119 --> 43:28.882
You taught me how.

43:37.763 --> 43:39.856
Oh, my God.

43:40.166 --> 43:42.361
Look who's here.

43:47.106 --> 43:48.801
Don't look at him.

43:49.008 --> 43:51.568
You don't want to stare too much.

43:53.713 --> 43:56.682
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

44:10.429 --> 44:13.990
- People can see.
- That would ruin your reputation how?

44:14.166 --> 44:15.690
What's that?

44:17.637 --> 44:22.165
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

44:22.341 --> 44:26.869
- And how many books are there?
- A hundred.

44:27.079 --> 44:31.914
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

44:32.118 --> 44:36.418
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

44:42.895 --> 44:47.127
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

44:47.333 --> 44:49.028
Maybe...

44:50.636 --> 44:54.299
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

44:54.507 --> 44:59.342
- Maybe you inspire me.
- Sounds like bull.

44:59.545 --> 45:01.240
- Which part?
- All of it.

45:01.447 --> 45:04.348
- It's not.
- Prove it.

45:12.391 --> 45:14.120
Jamie!

45:15.161 --> 45:19.063
- You've no idea how to be a friend.
- I don't just want that.

45:19.231 --> 45:23.395
- You don't know what you want.
- You're scared someone wants you.

45:23.602 --> 45:27.902
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind books...

45:28.107 --> 45:31.907
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

45:32.078 --> 45:35.343
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

45:35.514 --> 45:38.347
It's because you want
to be with me too.

45:58.938 --> 46:01.964
We gonna get this party jumping!

46:02.241 --> 46:06.143
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

46:06.345 --> 46:09.746
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

46:09.949 --> 46:14.579
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

46:14.787 --> 46:17.449
What we got here?

46:17.656 --> 46:22.855
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

46:23.229 --> 46:25.697
Jamie lent it to me.

46:25.898 --> 46:28.492
You're listening
to her people's music.

46:28.701 --> 46:30.293
- Her people?
- Yeah...

46:30.503 --> 46:34.940
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

46:35.141 --> 46:37.974
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

46:38.177 --> 46:40.077
- She's not like that.
- Well...

46:40.246 --> 46:44.046
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

46:44.250 --> 46:47.083
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

46:53.959 --> 46:58.453
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

46:58.664 --> 47:02.760
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

47:02.968 --> 47:06.597
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

47:06.806 --> 47:11.038
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

47:11.243 --> 47:14.940
- Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
- No.

47:15.247 --> 47:16.908
I did.

47:28.694 --> 47:30.184
You.

47:30.362 --> 47:32.694
Me.

47:37.269 --> 47:38.896
What is it?

47:39.105 --> 47:41.335
I got you something.

47:45.010 --> 47:46.944
Thank you.

47:50.249 --> 47:53.150
Well, I'll see you at school.

47:53.786 --> 47:55.447
Okay.

48:04.663 --> 48:08.099
- Mr. Carter.
- Later, Reverend.

48:30.456 --> 48:32.481
Boys like that...

48:34.527 --> 48:36.461
...they have...

48:41.167 --> 48:43.863
They have expectations.

48:44.069 --> 48:47.664
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

48:47.873 --> 48:49.841
Fine.

48:53.895 --> 48:56.796
You might not care
what I say or think...

48:56.999 --> 48:59.991
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

49:00.869 --> 49:03.770
I think he wants me to be happy.

49:06.942 --> 49:10.434
Dad, it's just a sweater.

49:10.646 --> 49:13.547
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

49:24.993 --> 49:27.461
I talked to your dad today.

49:27.663 --> 49:32.498
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

49:32.701 --> 49:37.070
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

49:39.207 --> 49:43.906
- Landon, there are a lot of reasons...
- He left us.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.674
You need to forgive him too.

49:52.854 --> 49:57.450
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

49:57.659 --> 50:01.356
She was looking all right
in that play.

50:01.563 --> 50:02.928
She doesn't look hot.

50:03.131 --> 50:08.398
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

50:08.603 --> 50:10.468
I have the best idea.

50:11.606 --> 50:14.905
Can you do something, like, move it?

50:15.277 --> 50:18.212
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

50:18.380 --> 50:20.439
Take one.

50:23.919 --> 50:26.945
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

50:29.324 --> 50:31.952
Hey, look at this.

50:32.160 --> 50:34.025
Here.

50:35.030 --> 50:37.362
Take one. Look.

50:42.003 --> 50:45.404
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

50:45.607 --> 50:49.976
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

50:50.178 --> 50:53.341
Landon and I are way over.

50:53.548 --> 50:56.847
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

51:00.822 --> 51:02.756
You'd be so beautiful...

51:02.958 --> 51:05.825
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

51:08.330 --> 51:10.764
- Come on, eat lunch with me.
- Okay.

51:10.966 --> 51:12.957
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

51:13.168 --> 51:14.658
Okay.

51:26.381 --> 51:28.042
Wow.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.718
Is that you?

51:36.358 --> 51:38.519
Nice bod.

52:06.721 --> 52:11.351
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.551
Stay here.

52:17.299 --> 52:20.632
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

52:20.836 --> 52:24.101
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

52:26.408 --> 52:28.876
- Dean, stop!
- You stay out of this!

52:37.352 --> 52:40.788
- We're through. We're through.
- That's great.

52:40.956 --> 52:43.117
- We're through forever!
- You okay?

52:43.358 --> 52:45.883
- You made a mistake, Landon!
- You sure?

52:46.094 --> 52:47.857
Let's get out of here.

52:48.063 --> 52:50.531
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

52:52.634 --> 52:55.831
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

52:56.037 --> 52:59.268
They're animals, all right?

52:59.474 --> 53:01.840
You want me to take you home?

53:04.112 --> 53:05.739
Let's get out of here.

53:06.948 --> 53:11.647
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

53:12.654 --> 53:16.920
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

53:22.831 --> 53:27.063
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

53:31.540 --> 53:35.840
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

53:38.947 --> 53:41.711
I'm sorry. I can't go.

53:45.453 --> 53:48.889
- You have something else going on?
- No.

53:49.090 --> 53:53.356
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

53:59.501 --> 54:01.731
I'm not allowed to date.

54:06.541 --> 54:11.035
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

54:13.048 --> 54:17.917
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

54:18.119 --> 54:22.886
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap..."

54:23.091 --> 54:25.924
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

54:26.094 --> 54:29.860
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

54:30.131 --> 54:32.258
That's not possible.

54:34.436 --> 54:40.136
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

54:40.342 --> 54:44.779
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

54:46.781 --> 54:50.581
You can exit the way you entered.

54:55.123 --> 54:58.889
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

54:59.094 --> 55:01.756
She deserves more than that.

55:02.597 --> 55:05.293
I'm asking you for the same thing...

55:05.500 --> 55:08.731
...you teach us every day in church.

55:10.405 --> 55:12.396
And that's faith.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.614
I can't believe you asked permission.

55:21.783 --> 55:24.843
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.885
- Thank you.
- This is for you.

55:27.088 --> 55:30.819
- Thank you very much.
- Would you like something to drink?

55:31.026 --> 55:33.290
- Sweet tea, please.
- Make that two.

55:33.495 --> 55:35.224
Right away.

55:37.699 --> 55:40.862
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

55:41.136 --> 55:43.900
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

55:44.105 --> 55:46.403
Choose whatever you want.

55:47.108 --> 55:49.736
So, what'll it be?

55:50.712 --> 55:52.942
Is everything okay?

55:53.548 --> 55:57.245
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.

56:04.025 --> 56:06.323
Would you like to dance?

56:07.929 --> 56:11.262
Sorry, I don't dance.

56:11.466 --> 56:15.232
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

56:15.970 --> 56:21.237
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

56:21.443 --> 56:24.207
Everybody can dance.

56:24.412 --> 56:27.210
Come on, you can't be that bad.

56:28.383 --> 56:30.283
Please?

56:30.919 --> 56:32.580
For me?

56:33.888 --> 56:35.583
Come on.

56:50.105 --> 56:54.667
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

56:54.876 --> 56:59.108
- In all fairness, you warned me, right?
- That's right.

57:03.485 --> 57:06.784
So, what's number one on your list?

57:08.957 --> 57:11.391
Okay.

57:11.593 --> 57:16.087
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

57:17.732 --> 57:20.257
Getting out won't be your problem.

57:20.468 --> 57:25.030
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

57:25.240 --> 57:27.174
What do you mean?

57:29.177 --> 57:32.010
I mean, you can do anything.

57:49.230 --> 57:53.166
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

57:57.005 --> 57:59.997
Come on, come on. Let's go!

58:00.208 --> 58:02.972
- What are we doing?
- Run!

58:03.178 --> 58:06.443
- Okay, okay. Stand there.
- All right.

58:06.648 --> 58:10.584
- One foot there, and one foot here.
- Okay.

58:12.687 --> 58:15.656
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

58:15.857 --> 58:19.122
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

58:20.795 --> 58:22.524
Okay.

58:25.166 --> 58:27.862
You're in two places at once.

58:40.348 --> 58:44.444
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

58:44.652 --> 58:46.643
You choose.

58:48.723 --> 58:51.351
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

58:56.464 --> 58:58.489
Where do you want it?

59:01.870 --> 59:03.735
Right here.

59:11.346 --> 59:13.246
Okay.

01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:23.915
How can you see places like this...

01:00:24.118 --> 01:00:28.953
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

01:00:30.892 --> 01:00:33.452
You're lucky to be so sure.

01:00:37.932 --> 01:00:40.230
It's like the wind.

01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:45.504
I can't see it, but I feel it.

01:00:45.707 --> 01:00:47.800
What do you feel?

01:00:50.678 --> 01:00:55.206
I feel wonder and beauty...

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:59.182
...joy, love.

01:01:00.655 --> 01:01:04.386
I mean, it's the center of everything.

01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:10.193
I might kiss you.

01:01:12.533 --> 01:01:14.831
I might be bad at it.

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.707
That's not possible.

01:01:45.133 --> 01:01:47.192
I love you.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:04.618
Now would be the time
to say something.

01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:10.680
I told you not to fall in love with me.

01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:22.157
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

01:03:23.831 --> 01:03:26.925
Landon, go home. The night's over.

01:03:27.135 --> 01:03:28.830
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:30.936
Good night, sir.

01:03:34.408 --> 01:03:37.844
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:43.741
- You act with that boy like you're...
- In love?

01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:48.251
- Jamie, you are a child.
- Dad, look at me...

01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:52.051
...l'm not a child.
- Then stop acting childish.

01:03:55.763 --> 01:03:57.628
I love him.

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:04.804
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

01:04:26.227 --> 01:04:28.718
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:30.965 --> 01:04:33.866
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:37.003
So, what did you tell your father?

01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:41.164
The truth. I just left you out of it.

01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:44.437
So, what do you want to see?

01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:46.871
Pluto.

01:04:47.148 --> 01:04:50.606
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:52.649
Right...

01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:57.885
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

01:05:00.494 --> 01:05:02.792
...and a blanket.

01:05:02.997 --> 01:05:06.831
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:11.195
Are you trying to seduce me?

01:05:11.405 --> 01:05:14.602
Why? Are you seducible?

01:05:16.577 --> 01:05:19.774
That's what I thought...

01:05:19.981 --> 01:05:22.643
...ergo, a second blanket.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:26.843
- One for me, and one for you.
- Thank you.

01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:43.898
- Can you find this star right here?
- Sure.

01:05:53.814 --> 01:05:57.375
So why am I looking for this star?

01:05:58.386 --> 01:06:01.082
Because I had it named for you.

01:06:03.257 --> 01:06:04.918
See?

01:06:05.726 --> 01:06:07.591
It's official.

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:12.632
It's from the International
Star Registry.

01:06:16.203 --> 01:06:18.433
This is wonderful!

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:25.403
I love you.

01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:42.285
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

01:06:51.038 --> 01:06:54.872
So, what's your number one?

01:06:59.013 --> 01:07:02.676
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

01:07:02.883 --> 01:07:05.716
That's where my parents were married.

01:07:35.116 --> 01:07:38.779
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.385
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.285
Sorry.

01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:49.428
Landon, were you with Jamie?

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.997
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.668
- Mom...
- Please!

01:07:56.036 --> 01:07:57.936
It's different with her.

01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:01.606
- It's different with her.
- Yes.

01:08:04.011 --> 01:08:06.673
It better be different with her.

01:08:09.016 --> 01:08:13.817
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

01:08:21.595 --> 01:08:24.529
"Examine a moon rock.

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:28.063
Go to college.

01:08:28.736 --> 01:08:31.966
Get into medical school."

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:42.011
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

01:08:42.216 --> 01:08:48.712
- But you'll have to work really hard.
- I can do that.

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:53.555
Yeah, you can.

01:08:58.064 --> 01:09:00.260
Mama...

01:09:00.968 --> 01:09:04.095
...Jamie has faith in me.

01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:07.229
You know?

01:09:07.942 --> 01:09:12.140
She makes me want to be different.

01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:15.015
Better.

01:09:16.216 --> 01:09:20.118
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:29.121
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:35.192
Are you worried
about your college applications?

01:09:35.402 --> 01:09:36.835
No.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.567
I'm not applying.

01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:43.573
- I thought you said...
- No, you assumed.

01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:48.180
- Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
- No.

01:09:50.117 --> 01:09:52.415
What are you gonna do?

01:09:55.856 --> 01:09:57.756
I'm sick.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:01.655
- I'll take you home, you'll be...
- No, Landon!

01:10:02.496 --> 01:10:03.963
I'm sick.

01:10:07.935 --> 01:10:10.426
I have leukemia.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:17.434
No.

01:10:18.279 --> 01:10:21.077
- You're 18, you're perfect.
- No.

01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:25.912
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

01:10:30.724 --> 01:10:33.090
So why didn't you tell me?

01:10:33.294 --> 01:10:37.628
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:41.198
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

01:10:41.368 --> 01:10:44.667
- Including me?
- Especially you!

01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:52.669
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

01:10:57.017 --> 01:11:01.351
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

01:12:09.823 --> 01:12:12.417
Dad, open the door!

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:24.260
Landon?

01:12:25.806 --> 01:12:28.741
- I need your help.
- What's wrong? You okay?

01:12:28.942 --> 01:12:32.400
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's...

01:12:34.248 --> 01:12:39.481
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

01:12:39.653 --> 01:12:41.416
Okay, calm down.

01:12:41.588 --> 01:12:45.149
- Can you help me or not?
- I don't know her case.

01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:49.455
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't...

01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:54.191
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:57.768
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

01:14:35.736 --> 01:14:38.330
Your mom called me.

01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:41.738
Talk to me, man.

01:14:41.975 --> 01:14:44.136
About what?

01:14:46.446 --> 01:14:48.311
About you...

01:14:48.515 --> 01:14:50.608
...about Jamie.

01:14:53.987 --> 01:14:56.512
What's there to talk about?

01:14:58.325 --> 01:15:01.453
She's the best person I've ever known.

01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:08.394
I didn't understand.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.904
It's okay, man.

01:15:17.311 --> 01:15:19.279
It's okay.

01:15:41.134 --> 01:15:46.299
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.609
I'm not going anywhere.

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:54.436
Please tell Jamie that.

01:16:23.744 --> 01:16:28.977
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

01:16:29.182 --> 01:16:31.275
I made you do too many things...

01:16:31.485 --> 01:16:34.682
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

01:16:43.864 --> 01:16:46.230
Are you scared?

01:16:47.301 --> 01:16:48.791
To death.

01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:54.104
Lighten up.

01:16:54.308 --> 01:16:56.572
It's not funny.

01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:20.861
I'm scared of not being with you.

01:17:24.604 --> 01:17:27.596
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.581
I'll be here.

01:17:41.722 --> 01:17:43.053
Mom.

01:17:45.559 --> 01:17:47.686
Can you do me a favor?

01:19:20.087 --> 01:19:22.419
So I talked to Eric.

01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:31.724
Need some help with this stuff?

01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:33.789
Sure.

01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:14.066
What's that boy doing in the yard?

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:20.102
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

01:21:26.179 --> 01:21:30.616
Landon. Run along, son.

01:21:30.817 --> 01:21:33.081
I'm not tired.

01:21:34.554 --> 01:21:37.523
I need just a minute with her.

01:21:45.532 --> 01:21:49.332
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

01:22:13.159 --> 01:22:15.127
Daddy...

01:22:16.463 --> 01:22:18.693
...so serious.

01:22:28.742 --> 01:22:34.738
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:38.212
...and you said you hated gravity...

01:22:38.418 --> 01:22:41.819
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

01:22:44.124 --> 01:22:48.754
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

01:22:48.962 --> 01:22:54.366
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.196
Dad...

01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:05.772
You know, when I lost your mother...

01:23:10.784 --> 01:23:15.084
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

01:23:23.063 --> 01:23:26.590
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

01:23:32.072 --> 01:23:34.006
But then...

01:23:38.445 --> 01:23:41.778
I love you so much.

01:24:09.309 --> 01:24:11.869
I wanted to give you these.

01:24:12.278 --> 01:24:15.042
The pictures from the play.

01:24:21.321 --> 01:24:24.688
- I'm sorry about the flyers.
- It doesn't matter.

01:24:28.495 --> 01:24:31.658
I guess you're with who you should be.

01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:35.194
It's like she chose you.

01:24:36.536 --> 01:24:39.835
Yeah, I don't even know why.

01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:44.543
I do.

01:25:24.584 --> 01:25:26.313
How you feeling?

01:25:26.519 --> 01:25:30.114
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Pretty good.

01:25:30.323 --> 01:25:33.349
- I have something for you.
- You do?

01:25:38.631 --> 01:25:41.896
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

01:25:42.268 --> 01:25:47.706
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

01:25:48.975 --> 01:25:52.570
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

01:25:54.481 --> 01:25:58.781
- Come on.
- Okay, let's check it out.

01:26:06.459 --> 01:26:08.552
"What is a friend?

01:26:08.761 --> 01:26:14.256
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

01:26:15.134 --> 01:26:18.035
- Right here.
- Okay.

01:26:18.671 --> 01:26:21.162
"Find out who you are...

01:26:21.374 --> 01:26:24.275
...and do it on purpose."

01:26:25.378 --> 01:26:27.243
That's Dolly Parton.

01:26:28.748 --> 01:26:31.410
I always thought she was smart.

01:26:41.394 --> 01:26:47.299
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

01:26:47.934 --> 01:26:51.734
Love is never boastful or conceited.

01:26:52.138 --> 01:26:55.699
It is never rude or selfish.

01:26:55.909 --> 01:27:01.040
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:13.188
- You know what I figured out today?
- What?

01:27:17.096 --> 01:27:19.792
Maybe God...

01:27:20.567 --> 01:27:25.334
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

01:27:26.706 --> 01:27:31.370
Like, this journey never ends.

01:27:33.313 --> 01:27:37.511
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

01:27:40.587 --> 01:27:43.522
To help me through all this.

01:27:54.734 --> 01:27:57.168
You're my angel.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:16.218
What's going on?

01:28:16.422 --> 01:28:21.291
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

01:28:21.494 --> 01:28:25.396
- What does she mean?
- He's been trying to reach you.

01:28:25.598 --> 01:28:29.227
He's going to pay
for private home care.

01:28:58.798 --> 01:29:00.663
Thank you.

01:29:20.653 --> 01:29:22.644
Sorry.

01:29:24.757 --> 01:29:27.624
It's all right, son.

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:09.200
- I gotta finish this tonight.
- Here, something hot.

01:30:11.571 --> 01:30:14.597
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

01:30:14.807 --> 01:30:17.401
- Yeah, they're in here.
- Good.

01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:21.569
- What about side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:25.512
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

01:30:27.653 --> 01:30:30.816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:30:31.124 --> 01:30:33.183
It's beautiful.

01:30:33.392 --> 01:30:36.259
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

01:31:16.702 --> 01:31:18.067
There it is.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:24.376
Come here. Come look.

01:31:26.445 --> 01:31:29.346
Come here. Come look, quick.

01:31:38.658 --> 01:31:40.888
That is cool.

01:31:50.703 --> 01:31:52.227
Do you love me?

01:31:59.679 --> 01:32:04.446
- Will you do something for me then?
- Anything.

01:32:07.486 --> 01:32:09.977
Will you marry me?

01:33:34.173 --> 01:33:40.544
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

01:33:40.746 --> 01:33:45.979
- I love you.
- "Love is never boastful nor conceited.

01:33:46.185 --> 01:33:48.710
It is never rude or selfish.

01:33:48.921 --> 01:33:53.756
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.329
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

01:33:58.531 --> 01:34:02.467
...but delights in the truth.

01:34:02.668 --> 01:34:08.038
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.800
...and to endure...

01:34:12.178 --> 01:34:14.271
...whatever comes."

01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:19.450
- L, Landon Rollins Carter...
- L, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

01:34:19.652 --> 01:34:22.018
...do solemnly swear...

01:34:22.221 --> 01:34:26.351
...to take Jamie Sullivan...
...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

01:34:26.559 --> 01:34:28.720
...as my wife.
...as my husband.

01:34:28.928 --> 01:34:34.889
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

01:34:54.653 --> 01:34:58.350
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

01:34:58.557 --> 01:35:03.324
...with more love than lots of people
know in a lifetime.

01:35:03.529 --> 01:35:08.057
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

01:35:30.589 --> 01:35:33.183
It's been four years...

01:35:34.293 --> 01:35:37.990
...but the vision of Jamie
walking towards me...

01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:42.233
...will stay with me forever.

01:35:43.769 --> 01:35:46.738
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

01:35:53.512 --> 01:35:56.777
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

01:36:03.889 --> 01:36:05.447
Landon.

01:36:09.428 --> 01:36:12.158
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:14.525
I'm getting by.

01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:30.610
- What's new, Landon?
- Well, I got into medical school.

01:36:30.816 --> 01:36:32.977
Your mother told me that.

01:36:33.786 --> 01:36:38.814
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

01:36:41.494 --> 01:36:43.519
Listen.

01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:53.800
I want you to have this.

01:36:54.273 --> 01:36:56.571
Oh, Landon.

01:37:02.615 --> 01:37:04.606
Oh, my.

01:37:07.553 --> 01:37:08.577
Thank you.

01:37:13.192 --> 01:37:16.457
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

01:37:21.534 --> 01:37:23.058
She did.

01:37:25.271 --> 01:37:27.262
It was you.

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:39.242
Jamie saved my life.

01:37:39.885 --> 01:37:42.752
She taught me everything.

01:37:43.122 --> 01:37:46.489
About life, hope...

01:37:46.692 --> 01:37:49.422
...and the long journey ahead.

01:37:50.829 --> 01:37:53.229
I'll always miss her.

01:37:54.567 --> 01:37:58.799
But our love is like the wind.

01:38:00.573 --> 01:38:03.007
I can't see it...

01:38:03.375 --> 01:38:05.673
...but I can feel it.
