What have you got on today?

Um...just work.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.757
Me too.

00:43.177 --> 00:47.557
Hey, we should go to that new
seafood restaurant in Launceston.

00:47.617 --> 00:49.237
Yeah. Sounds good.

00:57.217 --> 00:58.517

Oh. Uh...

01:13.057 --> 01:14.237
Oh, I can look.

01:14.297 --> 01:16.117
No, it's fine. I...
No, no, just being lazy. Sorry.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.597
Um...

01:17.657 --> 01:18.917
10 degrees, no rain.

01:18.977 --> 01:20.517
Oh, good.

01:20.577 --> 01:22.357

01:22.417 --> 01:24.237
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
BOTH: I'll get it.

01:24.297 --> 01:25.597
I'm already up, so...

01:30.057 --> 01:31.477
Good morning.

01:31.537 --> 01:33.477
What are you doing here?
Why are you wearing glasses?

01:33.537 --> 01:35.517
I don't want to miss anything
during your inspection.

01:35.577 --> 01:36.757
My what?

01:36.817 --> 01:38.997
You said I had to stay on top
of rental inspections.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.077
Yeah.

01:40.137 --> 01:41.717
Well, you've been renting here
for three months

01:41.777 --> 01:43.117
and it's time for
your first inspection.

01:43.177 --> 01:44.437
I did notify you about this
in writing.

01:44.497 --> 01:45.877
Yeah, I thought it was a joke.

01:45.937 --> 01:47.757
I take my job very seriously, sir.
"Sir"?

01:47.817 --> 01:49.517
May I come in, please?
No, no, no. No need.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.477
I inspect this place every day
and it's great. Perfect tenants.

01:52.537 --> 01:55.117
As you know, a tenant cannot
inspect their own property.

01:55.177 --> 01:56.877
Only the property manager
or the landlord.

01:57.977 --> 02:01.037
Can't have you inspecting yourself,
now, can we? That is revolting.

02:01.097 --> 02:03.637
OK, if you're gonna do this,
I expect you to be professional.

02:03.697 --> 02:05.757
I want you to treat us
like you would any other tenants

02:05.817 --> 02:07.557
and, above all, respect our privacy.

02:07.617 --> 02:08.677
Of course.

02:09.817 --> 02:11.717
To the medicine cabinet!

02:11.777 --> 02:14.157
# Yeah, we know

02:14.217 --> 02:18.397
# Even if we had so far to go

02:18.457 --> 02:21.197
# Even if the pace is slow

02:21.257 --> 02:24.517
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again

02:26.537 --> 02:29.157
# If we find

02:29.217 --> 02:32.797
# Something to feel that we belong

02:32.857 --> 02:36.037
# If we could right all the wrongs

02:36.097 --> 02:39.397
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again. #

02:47.257 --> 02:50.237
Hmm. No bribe cakes out for me.
Strike two.

02:50.297 --> 02:51.797
What was strike one?

02:51.857 --> 02:53.517
Oh, hey, Emma.
Hi, Grace.

02:53.577 --> 02:54.917
I didn't know you wore glasses.

02:54.977 --> 02:56.437
She doesn't.
Where'd you get them from?

02:56.497 --> 02:58.957
Chemist.
She's inspecting us.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.717
Oh, I thought she was joking.
I did too.

03:00.777 --> 03:02.277
Excuse me, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you

03:02.337 --> 03:03.717
to be quiet during the inspection.

03:03.777 --> 03:06.317
Now, this window.
Was it always like this?

03:06.377 --> 03:07.917
Like what?
Closed.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.997
It's been both open and closed.
Great question, though.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.237
I'd better take a look.

03:11.297 --> 03:12.477
Look, I know you're loving this,

03:12.537 --> 03:14.117
but could you get on with it
so we can get to work?

03:14.177 --> 03:16.237
Sir, I am at work.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.197
Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
a few questions.

03:19.537 --> 03:23.797
Uh, do you have an illegal marijuana
factory in any of the cupboards?

03:23.857 --> 03:24.957
No.

03:25.017 --> 03:27.357
How many times a day do you dust?
12.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.997
Minus a point for lying.

03:29.057 --> 03:30.957
This couch -
how often do you sit on it?

03:31.857 --> 03:34.037
Sir?
It's a couch. A lot.

03:34.097 --> 03:36.157
(INHALES SHARPLY) Ooh.
I'm not allowed to sit on the couch?

03:36.217 --> 03:39.397
I would perch above it, maintaining
the furniture's condition

03:39.457 --> 03:41.797
whilst simultaneously improving
my core strength.

03:41.857 --> 03:42.917
OK.

03:42.977 --> 03:45.237
I will now do an inspection
of your personalities.

03:45.297 --> 03:46.997
You - perfect. You - needs work.

03:47.057 --> 03:49.077
Yeah, we're done. Maybe
I'll come and inspect your place.

03:49.137 --> 03:51.637
Good luck.
Barbara's an owner-occupier, boy.

03:51.697 --> 03:53.997
And when I get my rental, Mrs Marsh
is gonna do my inspections,

03:54.057 --> 03:55.397
because she can't see very well.

03:55.457 --> 03:58.157
Are you actually
thinking of moving out?

03:59.897 --> 04:03.317
Well, Barbara's been dropping hints
about having the place to herself

04:03.377 --> 04:05.637
by saying things like
she wants the place to herself.

04:05.697 --> 04:07.677
Well, when were you thinking
of moving?

04:07.737 --> 04:09.437
I don't know. I can't afford it
just yet. But soon.

04:09.497 --> 04:10.517
Now, these throw pillows...

04:10.577 --> 04:12.037
You could move in here.
We have a spare room.

04:12.097 --> 04:13.397
What?

04:13.457 --> 04:14.677
Well...

04:14.737 --> 04:17.237
I mean, only if you want to.
Yeah, no...no pressure.

04:17.297 --> 04:20.517
I mean, it'd just be for a bit.
I'm getting my own place soon.

04:20.577 --> 04:21.877
A mansion, probably.

04:21.937 --> 04:23.117
Are you sure you wouldn't mind?

04:23.177 --> 04:24.237
No.
It's fine!

04:24.297 --> 04:26.157
No, no, no.
OK. That'd be great.

04:26.217 --> 04:28.197
Alright, well, that's settled, then.
We should get to work.

04:28.257 --> 04:29.957
I need to finish the inspection.

04:30.017 --> 04:31.757
Well, you can't. You're a tenant now.

04:31.817 --> 04:33.317
Dammit!

04:37.297 --> 04:39.437
I'm worried
Barbara will be really upset

04:39.497 --> 04:40.997
when I tell her I'm moving out.

04:41.057 --> 04:42.597
She said she wanted the place
to herself.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.357
Yeah, but when the reality hits her
that I'm going?

04:45.417 --> 04:46.837
If she cries, I'll cry.

04:46.897 --> 04:49.277
Maybe you should prepare yourself
for how fine she is with it.

04:49.337 --> 04:51.117
Pfft! We're like family now.

04:51.177 --> 04:52.877
Well, I'm her family,
and she loved when I moved out.

04:52.937 --> 04:54.557
It's different. We're like sisters.

04:54.617 --> 04:56.517
She has a sister
and they don't get along.

04:56.577 --> 04:58.797
Well, I'm like her...
Employee. Tenant.

04:58.857 --> 05:01.317
Person who lives with
her friend's mum like a weirdo.

05:01.377 --> 05:03.397
Yeah. That's a lot to lose
in one go.

(DOOR OPENS)

05:07.097 --> 05:09.317
Barbara, I've got something
to tell you.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.597
Yes?

05:10.657 --> 05:12.517
Maybe you should sit down.

05:12.577 --> 05:14.197
Or you could lean.

05:14.257 --> 05:15.957
OK.

05:16.017 --> 05:19.037
I'm gonna move in with Grace
and Daniel until I get my own place.

05:19.097 --> 05:20.557
Yes, it's the end of an era...

05:20.617 --> 05:21.957
That's great.

05:23.537 --> 05:25.117
I know you're gonna miss me!

05:27.257 --> 05:29.077
She's being so brave.
Very.

05:30.537 --> 05:31.997
Are you sure
it's not gonna be weird,

05:32.057 --> 05:33.757
me moving in with
you and your girlfriend?

05:33.817 --> 05:35.877
No, no. I mean, no weirder
than you living with my mum.

It'll be good.

a quick chat with you, please?

Just a quick chat.

Thank you.
OK.

We needed to have a secret chat,
and this looks more official.

to start, from the ground up.

Not long at all.

It was my dad's, but he passed away
recently and left it to me.

I didn't even know he owned it.

We worked together, but...
we didn't talk very much.

for Tasmanian masked owls.

Wow! How great!
Not really.

07:38.177 --> 07:39.757
He was a very intimidating man,

07:39.817 --> 07:41.477
and the only thing that scared me
more than him

07:41.537 --> 07:43.277
was the Tasmanian masked owls.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.717
Oh.
I think they hated me.

Those eyes.

over 20 years of owls...

..staring at you...

a Christmas rap album.

It's like rap music, but also
wrapping Christmas presents at...

08:31.657 --> 08:34.877
Wrapping and rap... Anyway, my point
is, I'm not gonna judge anyone.

08:36.177 --> 08:38.557

and see a quokka.

off the coast of Perth,

08:54.897 --> 08:57.117

if I can't find them.

That's not willpower.
Just don't eat my chips.

Well, I won't if you hide them,
or if you buy salt and vinegar.

I mean, I'll still eat them, but
I won't eat the whole packet. Ugh.

09:31.577 --> 09:34.157
Then why would you eat any of them?
They're still chips.

10:15.777 --> 10:17.437
(GASPS) Ugh!
Is that a snotty tissue?!

10:17.497 --> 10:18.797
I'm sorry, I forgot
that was in there.

10:18.857 --> 10:19.917
I'm gonna burn my hand off!

10:19.977 --> 10:21.797
No, no, it's dry-clean only!
Don't! Don't!

10:23.097 --> 10:25.917
I don't think Grace would get mad
at you for buying more bags.

10:25.977 --> 10:27.797
Probably not.
She might be disappointed.

10:27.857 --> 10:29.077
She's not your mum.

10:29.137 --> 10:31.237
You don't have to walk around
like you're gonna get told off.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.077
(SIGHS) Yeah, I know. It's just...

10:33.137 --> 10:35.717
It's my first relationship,
first time living together.

10:35.777 --> 10:37.277
I don't really know what I'm doing.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.997
I feel like I have to be on guard
the whole time.

10:39.057 --> 10:40.717
OK, what's going on?

10:41.657 --> 10:43.117
Stop unpacking!

10:43.177 --> 10:44.717
This conversation's too serious
for me to have

10:44.777 --> 10:45.997
with the back of your head.

10:48.217 --> 10:51.677
I have these doubts that it's...
not right or something.

10:51.737 --> 10:56.117
Or that it could be more right,
or that...I'm making it not right.

10:56.177 --> 10:59.317
I just...I'm overthinking it. A lot.

10:59.377 --> 11:02.637
That's OK. You do that sometimes.
But you love Grace, right?

11:02.697 --> 11:05.277
Yeah, I do, and I feel bad
I'm even having these thoughts.

11:05.337 --> 11:06.677
I just...

11:06.737 --> 11:09.837
I wish I'd had more experience
dating before we met,

11:09.897 --> 11:11.477
just so I'd know what was normal.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.517
Have you talked to her about it?
No.

11:13.577 --> 11:16.077
I'm still trying to sort it out
in my own head.

11:16.137 --> 11:17.757
Maybe you should be
high-fiving yourself

11:17.817 --> 11:20.637
that you got such a great
relationship on your first try.

11:20.697 --> 11:23.557
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.477
(FRONT DOOR OPENS)

11:26.737 --> 11:28.237
Are you serious?
Shh!

11:30.897 --> 11:33.277
OK. I'm unpacked. It's official.

11:33.337 --> 11:34.837
I put a bunch of clothes
in your wardrobe.

11:34.897 --> 11:36.597
I had to throw out
some of your things.

11:36.657 --> 11:38.477
And I tried on
most of your underpants.

11:38.537 --> 11:40.917
It'll be nice having you here.
Agreed.

11:40.977 --> 11:42.237
I don't want to freeload
off you guys,

11:42.297 --> 11:43.877
so let me know how much you want
for rent and bills.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.237
And how much was dinner tonight?

11:45.297 --> 11:46.917
Oh, Em, it's fine.
We'll sort it out later.

11:46.977 --> 11:48.797
Who wants a cup of tea?
Yes, please.

11:48.857 --> 11:50.517
Lemon and ginger for me.
Em?

11:50.577 --> 11:51.797
Yes.

11:51.857 --> 11:53.877
What type?
Guess.

11:53.937 --> 11:55.997
Uh...brushing teeth.

11:56.057 --> 11:57.677
Toothpaste. Mint...

11:57.737 --> 11:58.997
Oh, peppermint!
Yes!

12:02.537 --> 12:04.997
Was it hard telling Barbara
you're moving out?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.557
She put on a brave face.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.477
Hey.

12:15.337 --> 12:18.437
You didn't notice a vibe at all
over dinner, did you?

12:18.497 --> 12:20.517
Hmm?
Everything seemed normal?

12:20.577 --> 12:21.757
Yeah.

12:21.817 --> 12:24.117
I mean, we ate broccoli even though
none of our parents are here.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.037
But yeah. Why?
It's nothing.

12:26.097 --> 12:27.117
OK.

12:27.177 --> 12:29.517
Sometimes it feels like we've
run out of things to talk about.

12:29.577 --> 12:31.797
Who, us?
No, Dan and I.

12:31.857 --> 12:33.917
Well, you spend a lot of time
together.

12:33.977 --> 12:35.837
That's pretty normal, right?
I know.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.677
We've just been together so long,
it feels like...

12:40.737 --> 12:43.717
I don't know how it's supposed
to feel at this point.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.557
I mean, everyone's different.

12:47.617 --> 12:49.597
Don't get me wrong. I'm not unhappy.

12:49.657 --> 12:51.397
Tea.

12:53.097 --> 12:54.637
Thanks.

12:56.537 --> 12:57.957
Thank you.

12:58.017 --> 12:59.757
I put toothpaste in it.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.277
So...
Yeah?

13:09.337 --> 13:11.037
Last night was fun.
Yeah.

13:11.097 --> 13:13.157
Grace and I really like
having you around.

13:16.177 --> 13:18.837
Hey, when you're with us,
do we seem...

13:18.897 --> 13:20.637
OK, I'm just gonna say this out loud

13:20.697 --> 13:22.997
and I want you to answer
as honestly as possible.

13:23.057 --> 13:24.597
Sounds dramatic. Yeah.

13:24.657 --> 13:28.877
Did you ask me to move in so I could
see if your relationship is normal?

13:28.937 --> 13:31.797
What? No! No.

13:31.857 --> 13:33.037
No?
No!

13:33.097 --> 13:34.157
Really?

13:34.217 --> 13:35.837
You needed a place to stay,
we had a spare room.

13:35.897 --> 13:37.677
And that's it?

13:37.737 --> 13:39.357
Yeah. That's it.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.877
I mean, I didn't plan it,

13:42.937 --> 13:46.157
but now that you're there,
I value your opinion...

13:46.217 --> 13:47.877
Oh, my God!
You're overthinking it.

13:47.937 --> 13:49.117
Am I?

13:49.177 --> 13:50.717
Whenever I'm alone
with either of you,

13:50.777 --> 13:52.757
I feel like I'm getting quizzed
about your relationship.

13:52.817 --> 13:53.877
It's weird!

13:53.937 --> 13:55.357
Did Grace say something?
What'd she say?

13:55.417 --> 13:56.597
No. See? This is what I mean.

13:56.657 --> 13:58.197
If you need to talk to her,
you talk to her.

13:58.257 --> 14:00.077
I don't want to be in the middle.
You're not.

14:00.137 --> 14:01.917
We've just been alone together
for a while

14:01.977 --> 14:04.237
and it's nice having someone else
in the house

14:04.297 --> 14:07.197
who...might notice things
I might not.

14:07.257 --> 14:08.397
I know I'm great company,

14:08.457 --> 14:10.837
but you know most couples get a dog
or a kid at this point?

14:10.897 --> 14:11.997
Not a flatmate.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.797
What else do other couples do...
No!

14:22.297 --> 14:25.517
The ad for Lionel's land
has been up for ages!

14:25.577 --> 14:27.357
Why hasn't anyone been in touch yet?

14:27.417 --> 14:29.437
It's only been one day.
You have to be patient.

14:29.497 --> 14:32.837
I have been patient.
Right up until...right now.

14:32.897 --> 14:34.197
I put more photos up too.

14:34.257 --> 14:35.797
More? It's just grass, right?

14:35.857 --> 14:39.077
Yeah, but people might be
more likely to buy grass at sunset.

14:40.417 --> 14:41.877
Can you look at it again?

14:44.297 --> 14:45.837
It's good.

14:45.897 --> 14:48.317
Hang on. Did you add,
"There might be gold under it"?

14:48.377 --> 14:49.517
There might.

14:49.577 --> 14:50.997
Delete it.
Oh!

14:51.057 --> 14:52.797
You don't know anything
about marketing sizzle.

14:52.857 --> 14:54.557
I think your enthusiasm is great,

14:54.617 --> 14:56.397
but these things can be up
for weeks sometimes.

14:56.457 --> 14:57.717
I remember Mum had one...
(DING!)

14:57.777 --> 15:00.037
Oh, my God! Shut up!
I got an email from the council.

15:00.097 --> 15:02.077
They would like to make an offer!

15:02.137 --> 15:03.717
How much?
Doesn't matter. We're selling it.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.717
How much?
Get out of it. It's my listing.

15:05.777 --> 15:07.037
It's my listing. Get out of it!

15:07.097 --> 15:08.677
110 grand?
Yeah?

15:08.737 --> 15:10.917
The reserve price is 120.
Close enough.

15:10.977 --> 15:11.997
No, it has to be over.

15:12.057 --> 15:13.957
And remember, this is
the same council that charged me

15:14.017 --> 15:16.717
to replace a slab of concrete
that I'd already had changed.

15:16.777 --> 15:18.797
Now they're trying to lowball us?
Not gonna happen.

15:18.857 --> 15:20.357
But they want to buy it now.

15:20.417 --> 15:21.757
And I need to get my own place

15:21.817 --> 15:24.077
so I can stop being
some weird relationship referee.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.517
You can get a lot more for Lionel

15:25.577 --> 15:27.597
AND a much better commission
for yourself.

15:27.657 --> 15:29.117
Fine.

15:29.177 --> 15:30.837
But Lionel can't wait forever.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.757
He's old,
and quokkas are going extinct,

15:32.817 --> 15:34.357
so it's a race against two clocks.

15:34.417 --> 15:37.437
He's not that old. Be patient.

15:46.177 --> 15:47.677
Now what?

15:47.737 --> 15:48.917
Keep doing it.

15:59.777 --> 16:01.117
Hey...

16:01.177 --> 16:02.917
How's being patient going?

16:02.977 --> 16:04.237
Good.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.917
But I was thinking,

16:05.977 --> 16:09.637
what if instead of being patient,
I was proactive?

16:09.697 --> 16:10.917
Still a P word.

16:10.977 --> 16:13.157
What did you do?
Nothing.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.477
One thing.

16:14.537 --> 16:16.757
What?
I called...

16:16.817 --> 16:19.237
..your mum's...sister.

16:20.377 --> 16:22.557
Jenny? Aunty Jenny?

16:22.617 --> 16:24.997
The liar who lied to me?
Yes.

16:25.057 --> 16:27.717
Lied point-blank to my face
that I had council approval

16:27.777 --> 16:29.317
and got me a massive fine instead?

16:29.377 --> 16:30.837
That Jenny?
Yes.

16:30.897 --> 16:31.917
Why?

16:31.977 --> 16:33.757
She's a liar with money.
Oh!

16:33.817 --> 16:36.117
She got all that money for nothing
when Barbara sold the family home,

16:36.177 --> 16:37.677
and she grew up here, so I thought

16:37.737 --> 16:41.357
she might be keen to invest
in her home town, and...she is.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.117
Is Mum OK with this? Did you ask her?

16:43.177 --> 16:44.357
Well...no,

16:44.417 --> 16:46.757
but Jenny might not make an offer,
so there's nothing to tell.

16:46.817 --> 16:48.837
Until I show her the land.
Which is now.

16:48.897 --> 16:50.517
Em, we can't trust her.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.117
And I don't want us going into
business with people we can't trust.

16:54.177 --> 16:58.277
I'm sorry to do this,
but...I forbid it.

16:58.337 --> 16:59.517
You forbid it?

16:59.577 --> 17:00.797
Yep.

17:00.857 --> 17:02.437
Sorry, I didn't take any joy
in doing that,

17:02.497 --> 17:03.957
but I think it's for the best.

17:04.017 --> 17:06.237
What a shame it's my listing
and I can do what I want.

17:06.297 --> 17:07.717
I'm gonna need
the company car again.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.557
Well, you can't have it.
I never gave you the key back. Bye!

17:10.617 --> 17:11.677
Hang on!

17:20.937 --> 17:22.717
So it's just come on the market?

17:22.777 --> 17:25.677
That's right.
And we've already had some interest.

17:25.737 --> 17:29.917
It'd be lovely to own a piece
of my home town. Again.

17:29.977 --> 17:31.317
But it's a big decision.

17:31.377 --> 17:33.957
It's a huge decision. Too big.

17:34.017 --> 17:35.757
No. I mean, what could be simpler?

17:35.817 --> 17:40.357
Money from Rosehaven going
back into Rosehaven? It's poetic.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.597
It would be, wouldn't it?

17:42.657 --> 17:44.437
I don't know.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.717
Be nice to spend more time
down here. With Babs.

17:47.777 --> 17:49.917
I agree. And I think
she'd really like that too.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.037
Pfft!

17:51.097 --> 17:53.677
Sorry. Daniel has allergies.

17:53.737 --> 17:55.397
Let me give Henry a call.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.117
What is your problem?
I'm trying to get my first sale.

18:00.177 --> 18:01.557
I'm trying to stop you
getting ripped off.

18:01.617 --> 18:03.037
How's she gonna rip us off?
I don't know.

18:03.097 --> 18:04.197
I haven't worked it out yet.
Pfft!

18:04.257 --> 18:05.877
Well, Mum's gonna be furious
when she finds out.

18:05.937 --> 18:08.797
It could be a good thing for them
to heal. Be sisters again.

18:08.857 --> 18:11.157
I think that's a huge call.
Well, that's what I do now.

18:11.217 --> 18:12.757
I make calls and I close deals.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.077
You're not gonna close any deals
if you deal with someone like her.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.157
Alright. I think I'll make an offer.

18:18.217 --> 18:19.597
Great!
(LAUGHS)

18:20.857 --> 18:23.557
You won't regret it. Good call.

18:23.617 --> 18:25.397
Uh...

18:25.457 --> 18:26.997
OK.
Yes?

18:27.057 --> 18:28.757
So, to make your offer,

18:28.817 --> 18:32.557
you will specify
how much you are willing to pay

18:32.617 --> 18:36.477
and any conditions that you would
like to attach to the offer,

18:36.537 --> 18:39.237
such as...um...

18:39.297 --> 18:40.757
Such as?

18:40.817 --> 18:42.517
Such as...

18:42.577 --> 18:44.637
Daniel?
I'm busy.

18:44.697 --> 18:46.237
Excuse me for a second.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.077
Can I talk to you please?

18:55.977 --> 18:57.797
I know you don't like
what I'm doing,

18:57.857 --> 18:59.757
but this is my listing,
so can you help me, please?

18:59.817 --> 19:01.157
What are the conditions?

19:01.217 --> 19:02.757
Hurry up! She might change her mind.

19:02.817 --> 19:04.677
I don't remember.

19:04.737 --> 19:06.117
Fine, you don't know.
Of course I do.

19:06.177 --> 19:07.877
It's settlement period and deposit.
Thank you.

19:07.937 --> 19:09.637
Wait.
Oh, God. Barbara's here.

19:09.697 --> 19:12.317
I...called her.

19:12.377 --> 19:13.397
You dobbed on me?

19:13.457 --> 19:14.637
Well, Mum's our boss,

19:14.697 --> 19:17.637
so if you won't listen to me,
maybe you'll listen to her.

19:17.697 --> 19:19.157
Did she sound mad?

19:19.217 --> 19:22.397
She said, "Right. I'm coming."
In a mad way?

19:22.457 --> 19:24.717
Well, she always sounds mad,
so, yeah.

19:26.137 --> 19:27.637
Hello, Babs.

19:27.697 --> 19:28.757
Jen.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.157
I heard you're interested
in some land.

19:32.217 --> 19:34.277
Yes, but she hasn't made
an offer yet.

19:34.337 --> 19:35.837
It's a bit of perfect timing.

19:35.897 --> 19:37.677
I was thinking about how to use
the money from the sale

19:37.737 --> 19:38.917
when Emma called.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.397
I heard.

19:40.457 --> 19:42.677
I don't remember who called who.

19:42.737 --> 19:46.437
I've had a look at it. I like it.
But I'd love to hear your thoughts.

19:46.497 --> 19:47.637
Me too.

19:50.297 --> 19:51.717
I think it's a good investment.

19:52.617 --> 19:54.917
Location's great,
and it's fairly valued.

19:54.977 --> 19:56.437
I think so too.

19:56.497 --> 19:58.237
And it'll give me a reason
to get back here more often.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.797
Yeah.
That's all?

19:59.857 --> 20:00.877
Yeah, is that all?

20:00.937 --> 20:02.757
Yeah. I'll leave you to it.

20:08.857 --> 20:10.717
Shall we make this official?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.597
I think so. Mmm!

20:14.177 --> 20:16.237
OK, settlement period and deposit...

20:17.257 --> 20:20.277
I can't believe she made an offer
and Mum just let it happen.

20:20.337 --> 20:22.117
I can't decide how to tell Lionel.
(RINGING TONE)

20:22.177 --> 20:24.677
Well, you just tell him.
This should be a special moment.

20:24.737 --> 20:26.357
It is. Just pass on the information.

20:26.417 --> 20:27.637
LIONEL: Hello?

20:27.697 --> 20:29.477
Lionel, it's Emma.

20:30.377 --> 20:32.757
So, that, uh, other offer
we were chasing?

20:32.817 --> 20:34.437
Yeah.
It just came in.

20:34.497 --> 20:36.557
Right. What was it?

20:36.617 --> 20:38.917
It was 100 bucks and a goat.

20:40.097 --> 20:41.437
What?

20:41.497 --> 20:44.917
And I was like, "You get out of here
with that crap offer.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.997
"That's no good.
What's your real offer?"

20:47.057 --> 20:48.837
And they said, "30 grand."

20:48.897 --> 20:50.877
Uh, what?

20:50.937 --> 20:53.197
Plus 100. It was 130 grand!

20:53.257 --> 20:56.917
What?! Well, that...that's amazing!
So great!

20:56.977 --> 20:59.317
We'll get the paperwork started.
Congratulations!

20:59.377 --> 21:01.557
And thanks again for choosing
McCallum Real Estate.

21:01.617 --> 21:02.877
Oh! Who's that?

21:02.937 --> 21:04.437
Uh, it's Daniel.
Who?

21:04.497 --> 21:07.197
Daniel. I was here when you first
came in. It doesn't matter.

21:07.257 --> 21:09.837
OK, uh, bye, Lionel!
Congratulations again!

21:09.897 --> 21:11.957
Thank you! Bye!
Bye.

21:12.017 --> 21:14.517
So, he was happy
with the offer, then?

21:15.977 --> 21:17.957
I'm sorry I called Jenny
without asking you...

21:18.017 --> 21:19.477
No, it's fine.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.997
Getting the best price
for our clients is the priority.

21:22.057 --> 21:23.757
How are you OK with this?

21:23.817 --> 21:25.677
Aunty Jenny must be planning
some long con or something.

21:25.737 --> 21:27.797
Not everything Jen does
is to trick people.

21:27.857 --> 21:29.957
Could be it's time we tried
a bit harder to get along.

21:30.017 --> 21:31.277
Good work, Emma.

21:31.337 --> 21:33.037
Thank you.

21:40.537 --> 21:44.757
I just...I can't believe
you didn't get in trouble today.

21:44.817 --> 21:47.237
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.
It's just...

21:47.297 --> 21:49.277
It's like you walked through
a minefield

21:49.337 --> 21:50.757
and found buried treasure.

21:50.817 --> 21:52.397
Do you want to touch my hand
for good luck?

21:52.457 --> 21:53.397
Yes.

21:54.297 --> 21:56.877
At least you got to call the council
and tell them they lost.

21:56.937 --> 21:58.037
Yeah, that was fun.

21:58.097 --> 21:59.237
I like to think they could tell

21:59.297 --> 22:01.157
I was doing this towards
the speakerphone the whole time.

22:01.217 --> 22:02.637
What are we doing for dinner?

22:02.697 --> 22:04.477
Uh, Grace and I are having spaghetti

22:04.537 --> 22:07.157
and you are having something
I found in the bin.

22:07.217 --> 22:09.557
Was the bin full of spaghetti?
No.

22:09.617 --> 22:12.957
I can make myself scarce
if you guys need to...chat.

22:13.017 --> 22:15.797
I don't know. Do we?

22:15.857 --> 22:17.997
Look, you've both got stuff
on your mind,

22:18.057 --> 22:20.357
and the way to deal with that
is to talk.

22:20.417 --> 22:21.557
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

22:21.617 --> 22:23.757
Why is she knocking?
Must need a hand with the groceries.

22:23.817 --> 22:26.197
That sounds like a boyfriend job.
Help, or no dessert.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.517
Is my dessert also from the bin?
Yes.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.077
Olive?

22:34.137 --> 22:35.477
What did you do?

22:35.537 --> 22:36.917
When?

22:36.977 --> 22:38.837
I just got a call from Marge
from the council

22:38.897 --> 22:41.317
saying you won't sell them
the land off Gipps Road.

22:41.377 --> 22:42.837
Yeah? So?

22:42.897 --> 22:44.197
So it's true?

22:44.257 --> 22:46.477
Uh, it is.
I closed the deal today.

22:46.537 --> 22:49.717
The council were buying it
to turn it into a park for the town.

22:49.777 --> 22:51.237
And paying for it.

22:51.297 --> 22:53.437
We've been campaigning for it
for years.

22:53.497 --> 22:57.477
And finally, some land came up in
the right spot and the right price,

22:57.537 --> 22:59.757
and you go and sell it
to someone else.

22:59.817 --> 23:01.877
We got a better offer.
So it's "we" now?

23:01.937 --> 23:04.717
Good for you.
You just cost the town a park.

23:04.777 --> 23:08.037
Olive, it's our job to get the best
price we can for our clients.

23:08.097 --> 23:09.677
We didn't know about a park.

23:09.737 --> 23:12.157
Because you don't come
to the Neighbourhood Watch meetings.

23:12.217 --> 23:15.277
I don't think people will be upset
at us for doing our job.

23:16.217 --> 23:17.397
Not yet.

23:18.377 --> 23:19.637
What do you mean?

23:19.697 --> 23:22.237
Right now,
I'm the only one who knows.

23:23.297 --> 23:26.637
But once it's an appropriate time
tomorrow morning to call people...

23:27.817 --> 23:32.197
..there will be a storm coming your
way that you can't even imagine.

23:32.257 --> 23:33.997
Daniel really took the lead
on this one...

23:34.057 --> 23:35.637
You haven't seen fury

23:35.697 --> 23:39.117
like a town that was about to get
something it wants for free

23:39.177 --> 23:40.837
and it's taken away from them.

23:43.617 --> 23:45.837
Sleep well.

23:58.617 --> 23:59.797
(HORN BLARES)

23:59.857 --> 24:01.717
Thanks a lot!
Oh!

24:01.777 --> 24:03.637
We didn't know the council were
trying to build a park, OK?

24:03.697 --> 24:05.797
We were just trying to get the most
amount of money for our client.

24:05.857 --> 24:08.117
Rosehaven doesn't even have
a fast food chain yet.

24:08.177 --> 24:09.237
WOMAN: Traitors!

24:10.577 --> 24:13.237
Uh, Daniel McCallum.
I'm boycotting you!

24:13.297 --> 24:14.717
There must be some way
we can make it up to you.

24:14.777 --> 24:15.997
Give us our park back.

24:16.057 --> 24:17.717
Oh, my God. I've got an idea.

24:20.577 --> 24:23.317
You know, I don't think she actually
wanted us to sleep well.

24:23.377 --> 24:25.037
I don't think anyone
has ever slept well

24:25.097 --> 24:27.797
after being told...
(MENACINGLY) .."Sleep well."

24:27.857 --> 24:29.877
Anything sounds threatening
in that voice.

24:29.937 --> 24:31.477
"See you soon!"

24:31.537 --> 24:33.157
"Night-night!"

24:33.217 --> 24:34.757
"Nice car."

24:34.817 --> 24:36.677
"Your shoelace is undone."

24:36.737 --> 24:38.997
GRACE: Hey, where did
all these bags come from?

24:39.057 --> 24:40.837
Oh, they're mine.
Oh.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.757
OK. I'll put them in your room.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.517
"You're a good friend."

24:47.577 --> 24:49.397
"I know."

24:50.337 --> 24:51.917
