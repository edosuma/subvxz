00:03.969 --> 00:04.790
Hut one!

00:04.900 --> 00:05.870
Hut two!

00:05.990 --> 00:09.440
High!
Come on, come on! Get open!

00:10.470 --> 00:12.120
Inception!

00:12.400 --> 00:13.940
Touchdown!

00:17.220 --> 00:19.550
We did it, yay!

00:21.900 --> 00:23.570
Pathetic.

00:23.630 --> 00:25.570
Playing all by yourself.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.570
Get some friends, kid.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.370
I'm all in.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.080
Fold.
[Grunts]

00:34.140 --> 00:36.550
I'm never playing
with you again.

check it out.
I stole them from the movie theater.

01:04.209 --> 01:06.340
3-d glasses. Ooh.

01:06.410 --> 01:09.410
From now on,
I'll take my entertainment

01:09.480 --> 01:12.820
exclusively in 3 dimensions.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.480
Daffy, those only work
at the movie theater.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.820
[Indistinct talking]

01:16.890 --> 01:20.390
Whoa. He's so close.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.190
Back off, newsman.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.960
It's not in 3-d.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.560
Whoa!

01:25.630 --> 01:27.730
It's like I can touch you.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.300
Please, don't.

01:29.370 --> 01:30.970
[Doorbell rings]

01:33.470 --> 01:35.810
Ehh, what's up, neighbor?

01:35.870 --> 01:37.870
Whoa!

01:39.380 --> 01:43.210
Ugh. Back to 2-d.
What a bummer.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.780
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:47.950 --> 01:49.350
It's my son gossamer.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.450
He's having some trouble
fitting in at school.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.290
All the kids pick on him
and call him a monster.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.290
Duh. He is a monster.
[Whirring]

01:57.360 --> 01:59.500
I try to help him,
but he's at that age

01:59.560 --> 02:01.500
where he doesn't want
to listen to his mama.

02:01.570 --> 02:04.300
The other day,
he called me a witch.

02:04.370 --> 02:05.630
[Whirring stops]

02:05.700 --> 02:07.370
You are a witch.

02:10.169 --> 02:13.280
[Whirring]

02:13.340 --> 02:15.480
Do you need
to be doing that right now?

02:15.550 --> 02:18.380
[Whirring stops]

02:18.450 --> 02:21.980
Protein shake.
It's how I maintain this body.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.690
[Whirring]

02:23.750 --> 02:27.190
Anyway, gossamer needs help
making friends.

02:27.260 --> 02:30.360
Now, I think he could benefit
from a positive male role model.

02:30.430 --> 02:33.130
Could you take him to school
tomorrow and maybe talk to him?

02:33.200 --> 02:34.460
[Whirring stops]

02:34.530 --> 02:36.070
You want Bugs to talk to him?

02:36.130 --> 02:38.570
He doesn't know the first thing
about making friends.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.040
He was born with friends.
He's got too many friends.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.710
The only person who can help
a weirdo like gossamer

02:44.770 --> 02:46.940
is another weirdo.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.620
[Clatters]

02:55.550 --> 02:57.090
That's a great idea.

02:57.150 --> 02:58.820
You can take him
to school tomorrow.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.660
What? No.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.260
Find another weirdo.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.030
No one helped me out
when I was a kid,

03:04.090 --> 03:06.560
so I'm not helping him out.

03:06.630 --> 03:10.430
You know,
I'm not always a nice witch.

03:15.610 --> 03:18.840
I'm only taking you to school
'cause I'm afraid of your mom.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.810
Don't open that.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.750
Sorry.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.150
You're a real weird dude.

03:26.220 --> 03:27.980
Sorry.

03:28.050 --> 03:29.590
Why are you always apologizing?

03:29.650 --> 03:30.750
Sorry.

03:30.820 --> 03:33.360
Listen, kid.
School is like prison.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.490
And I should know.
I've been to both.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.330
You do your time,
then you get out.

03:37.390 --> 03:39.830
And if you're lucky,
you'll grow up to be as mature

03:39.900 --> 03:41.830
and well-adjusted as me.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.500
Aw, come on.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.730
Move it, lady!
[Honking horn]

03:48.570 --> 03:51.770
Just get out here.
This mom's taking forever.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.640
I mean, how many kids
do you have to have

03:54.710 --> 03:58.680
before you feel like you've got a family?
It's irresponsible!

03:58.750 --> 04:00.620
Will you pick me up
after school?

04:00.680 --> 04:02.220
Pick you up?

04:02.290 --> 04:05.820
What do you think, I just sit
around all day watching tv?

04:05.890 --> 04:09.660
You don't think I have a job
or other responsibilities?

04:09.730 --> 04:11.230
My mom says you're a bum

04:11.290 --> 04:12.830
and that you mooch off
of Mr. Bunny.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.030
Well, your mom's stupid.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.930
Don't tell her I said that.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.769
[Engine starts and gears grind]

04:21.300 --> 04:23.010
[Horn honks]

04:29.850 --> 04:32.280
Hey, gossamer.
[Slaps]

04:32.350 --> 04:34.120
- [Giggling]
- See ya later, pal.

04:34.180 --> 04:37.090
[Laughter]

04:37.150 --> 04:39.590
[Bell brings]

04:39.660 --> 04:41.760
Hi, Kyle.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.090
Hi, Jason.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.490
Hi, Emily.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.260
What's up, Trevor?

04:46.330 --> 04:48.160
Hi, Maya.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.000
Hey, Andrew.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.970
[Engine idling]

04:56.040 --> 04:57.870
[Engine shuts off]

04:59.080 --> 05:01.110
Why didn't you defend yourself?

05:01.180 --> 05:04.110
My mom says
violence is never the answer.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.820
Well, your mom is wrong.
It's almost always the answer.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.490
Don't tell her I said that.

05:09.550 --> 05:12.320
And anyway, I don't know
how to defend myself.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.960
Then it's time to go to school.

05:16.630 --> 05:17.790
Not that school.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.530
The school of hard knocks.

05:28.890 --> 05:29.990
[Stammering]
Where's Daffy?

05:30.060 --> 05:31.990
He's helping
our neighbor's kid.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.330
Try it.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.060
We already got our pizza.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.330
No, try this one.

05:41.270 --> 05:42.540
Well?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.170
I like it.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.540
This one's frozen.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.310
Pretty impressive.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.810
Pretty impressive?
It's very impressive.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.550
Let me tell you something, pinky.
Uh, it's Porky.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.650
I like to see you make a
restaurant-quality frozen pizza.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.550
You couldn't.
You know why?

05:58.620 --> 06:01.660
Because it's next to impossible.
But I did it.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.660
And now, I'm going to sell
Speedy Gonzales' frozen pizzas

06:04.730 --> 06:08.700
in grocery stores
all across the country!

06:10.730 --> 06:11.770
What are they doing?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.800
I'm filming the commercial
later today.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.470
Hey, you should be in it.
Nah.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.810
Come on.
You could be the customer.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.240
I--I don't--

06:21.310 --> 06:22.840
- I could play the customer.

06:22.910 --> 06:25.750
Pinky, please.
I'm talking to SeÃ±or Bugs.

06:25.820 --> 06:29.020
What do you say? Would you be in
my frozen pizza commercial?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.090
- Ehh...
- I'd love to do it.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.820
Yeah. Just let Porky do it.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.760
Can I at least use your slogan?

06:34.820 --> 06:36.830
- What slogan?
- I like it.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.060
When did I say that?

06:38.130 --> 06:39.330
When you tried the pizza.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.900
It's the perfect slogan--

06:40.960 --> 06:42.500
not too much, not too little.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.570
I don't love it.
I like it.

06:44.630 --> 06:47.240
It's pizza, man.
It's not a new car.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.070
- Whatever.
- Oh! Yippee! [Laughs]

06:50.140 --> 06:51.810
Relax, pinky, ok?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.680
It's a commercial, not a movie.

06:53.740 --> 06:57.150
But go see the makeup girl
you're just so pink.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.820
I guess that's
where he gets his name.

07:03.150 --> 07:07.390
This is the school
I graduated from.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.530
[Grunting]

07:10.590 --> 07:12.690
I'm kind of
a legend around here.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.730
What's up, man?

07:15.830 --> 07:18.300
I don't know you.

07:18.370 --> 07:22.140
Self-defense is about
knowing your strengths

07:22.200 --> 07:24.240
and your opponent's weaknesses.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.640
It's about stamina.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.480
Discipline.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.480
And never...

07:30.550 --> 07:32.310
[Grunts]

07:32.380 --> 07:34.280
Letting your guard down.

07:34.350 --> 07:35.850
Oof!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.790
[Grunting]

07:38.850 --> 07:41.360
Shouldn't we be wearing
boxing gloves?

07:41.420 --> 07:43.960
Does anybody wear boxing
gloves in a street fight?

07:44.030 --> 07:45.960
Also, there's
a $5.00 glove rental fee.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.860
Now, let's get it on.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.360
[Grunting]

07:49.430 --> 07:50.800
I don't want to fight.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.970
Too late.
You're in a fight.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.370
And you're already losing.
You know why?

07:55.440 --> 07:58.140
You're off balance.
And when you're off balance,

07:58.210 --> 08:00.880
you're open to one of these!

08:00.940 --> 08:03.210
Hi-ya!
[Grunts]

08:03.280 --> 08:04.750
Lucky shot.

08:04.810 --> 08:08.350
I didn't do anything.
How's this going to help me make friends?

08:08.420 --> 08:11.290
I see what you're doing.
Mind games.

08:11.350 --> 08:15.620
Well, mind games are no match
for one of these!

08:15.690 --> 08:17.630
[Grunts]

08:17.690 --> 08:19.860
[Panting]

08:22.460 --> 08:24.630
All right.
Let's take a break.

08:24.700 --> 08:28.470
I'm sure this is a lot of
information for you to absorb.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.810
I'm going
to the vending machine.

08:30.870 --> 08:34.039
I'll bring you back
one of these!

08:34.110 --> 08:36.539
[Grunts]

08:36.610 --> 08:38.780
Well, we've learned
2 things here today.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.780
You refuse to defend yourself,

08:40.850 --> 08:43.220
and I need to double up
on my protein shakes.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.450
I'm never going
to get any friends.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.690
Not with that "kick me" sign
still on your back.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.360
Give me that.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.300
"School talent show."

08:58.370 --> 09:00.340
Huh.
What is it?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.340
I think
I just figured out a way

09:02.400 --> 09:04.110
for you to make some friends,

09:04.170 --> 09:06.610
a way for you
to impress everyone

09:06.680 --> 09:08.510
and instantly become popular

09:08.580 --> 09:10.850
in a single, dramatic moment.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.780
You mean enter the talent show?

09:12.850 --> 09:14.450
Oh, I was going to say

09:14.520 --> 09:17.120
watch the talent show wearing
a really cool jacket.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.690
But entering
the talent show--

09:19.760 --> 09:21.560
that's a great idea.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.860
Wow. You're lucky
I thought of it.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.190
Do you have any talents?

09:25.260 --> 09:26.430
I could sing.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.330
Ugh. No way.
Singing's lame.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.430
Come on. We can come up with
something better than that.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.170
Oh, wait.
I forgot something.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.770
To give you one of these!

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
[Screams]

09:39.740 --> 09:43.380
Do you want restaurant-quality pizza
in the comfort of your own home?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.350
Hello.
I'm Speedy Gonzales

09:45.410 --> 09:47.280
of Speedy Gonzales's Pizzarriba

09:47.350 --> 09:51.350
telling you that you can now enjoy
my pizza in a frozen variety.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.690
But don't take my word for it.
Here's a real-life customer.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.030
Ahem.
What did you think, sir?

09:57.090 --> 09:59.190
I like it.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.260
Cut.
[Beeps]

10:01.330 --> 10:03.330
Pinky, you're overselling it.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.670
I told you you could be
in the commercial,

10:04.730 --> 10:05.930
but you got to pull back.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.940
You got to play real.
Let's take it again.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.840
[Beeps]

10:09.910 --> 10:11.170
What did you think, sir?

10:11.240 --> 10:12.770
I like it.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.010
Nope. It's not working.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.940
SeÃ±or Bugs,
let me hear you say it again.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.280
- I like it.
- That's it! Perfect.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.450
Sorry, pinky.
There's just something about him,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.480
a likeability factor.
I mean,

10:22.550 --> 10:24.350
this guy's ok...

10:24.420 --> 10:27.690
But I want to party
with this guy.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.190
Let's take it again.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.460
Hey, pinky, I'm sorry.
Scooch to your left a little bit.

10:35.530 --> 10:37.970
Little more.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.630
Little more.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.470
Little more.

Little more.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.310
Little more.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.010
Little more.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.410
How's this?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.480
Perfecto.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.320
Talent. It can't be taught.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.250
It can't be bought.
It can't be faked.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.320
It just is.
You dig?

11:02.390 --> 11:04.390
- Do I dig what?
- 2, 3, 4!

11:04.460 --> 11:05.890

11:10.400 --> 11:11.500

11:11.570 --> 11:13.840

- 2, 3, 4!

11:13.900 --> 11:17.170

11:20.310 --> 11:21.510
[Music stops]

11:21.580 --> 11:23.810
You're doing it wrong.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.910
It's a simple kickball change,

11:25.980 --> 11:27.580
a shimmy to the right,

11:27.650 --> 11:29.080
a shimmy to the left,

11:29.150 --> 11:31.750
pivot, step, and head roll.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.190
Was that so difficult?

11:34.260 --> 11:37.560
I was thinking maybe I could
sing at the talent show.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.730
Are you out of your mind?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.660
That is so lame!

11:41.730 --> 11:45.230
I mean, do you know how girly and
pathetic you'd look if you sang?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.070
No, no, no.
If you want friends,

11:48.140 --> 11:50.170
you need to dance.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.740
I'm not a dancer.

11:51.810 --> 11:54.910
Well, you just keep
telling yourself that.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.480
This is just so frustrating!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.910
There is a dancer
inside of you.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.250
Shame on you for not seeing it,

12:02.320 --> 12:05.850
and shame on me for being
the only one who does.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.420
I need to cool off.
I'm going to take five.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.660
But not before
I give you one of these!

12:15.230 --> 12:17.400
Will you go make me
a protein shake?

12:20.330 --> 12:22.140
I'm Speedy Gonzales

12:22.200 --> 12:23.840
of Speedy Gonzales's
Pizzarriba telling you

12:23.910 --> 12:27.070
that you can now enjoy my pizza
in a frozen variety.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.740
I like it.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.680
And you will, too.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.510
Speedy Gonzales's frozen pizza

12:32.580 --> 12:34.350
in your grocer's freezer.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.580
Huh. How much?

12:35.650 --> 12:37.680
Oh, it's on the house.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.590
You famous.

12:42.590 --> 12:46.930
Honey, look.
It's the "I like it" guy.

12:52.670 --> 12:53.800
Oh!

12:53.870 --> 12:56.440
"I like it" guy!
Say it.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.210
I like it.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.540
Yeah!

13:00.610 --> 13:02.610
I like it!

13:04.450 --> 13:07.380
You probably get this all the
time, but will you say it?

13:07.450 --> 13:08.880
I'm kind of in a hurry.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.720
Please?
Just one time.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.920
[Sighs]
I like it.

13:12.990 --> 13:15.190
Do you mind? Will you say
it for my outgoing message?

13:15.260 --> 13:17.920
- I like it.
- Ooh! Wasn't recording.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.260
One more time?
I like it.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.360
Whoo-hoo!
I like it!

13:22.430 --> 13:24.360
I'm not sure I like it.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.000
[Siren chirps]
Say it.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.370
Yeah. You.
"I like it" guy. Say it.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.370
- I like it?
- Classic.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.210
[Siren]

13:37.280 --> 13:39.610
This whole time,
we've been focusing

13:39.680 --> 13:42.120
on the talent part
of the talent show.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.950
But what about the show part?

13:44.020 --> 13:45.890
[Engines rev]

13:45.950 --> 13:48.620
You don't want me
to juggle chainsaws, do you?

13:48.690 --> 13:51.120
No. That would be
ludicrous.

13:51.190 --> 13:54.030
I want you to juggle chainsaws

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
that have been lit on fire.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.470
Can't I just sing
at the talent show?

14:00.530 --> 14:02.370
No, you can't sing.
[Smoke alarm beeping]

14:02.440 --> 14:04.270
That would be a death sentence.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.480
Run for our lives!

14:12.150 --> 14:15.020
You saved my life.
[Sirens wailing]

14:15.080 --> 14:16.750
I'd like to repay you

14:16.820 --> 14:18.650
by giving you one of these!

14:19.920 --> 14:23.160
It's like those protein shakes
are making me weaker.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.560
My house!

14:30.770 --> 14:33.770
Hey! Hey,
it's the "I like it" guy!

14:33.830 --> 14:35.940
You live here?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Say it!

14:37.070 --> 14:39.070
My house is burning down!

14:39.140 --> 14:40.770
That's not the line.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.610
Turn on the water!

14:42.680 --> 14:44.440
No. You remember.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.450
The little mouse goes,
"what do you think, sir?"

14:47.520 --> 14:49.020
And you say...

14:49.080 --> 14:51.620
I like it!

14:51.690 --> 14:54.050
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

15:07.740 --> 15:10.870
This is the bus station.
What about the talent show?

15:10.940 --> 15:13.210
You can't go
to the talent show!

15:13.270 --> 15:15.780
You don't have a talent.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.510
Here. Take this.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.110
What's this?

15:19.180 --> 15:20.950
Everything you need
to start a new life--

15:21.020 --> 15:22.620
fake passport, fake money,

15:22.680 --> 15:24.950
and my fake number
in case of emergency.

15:25.020 --> 15:29.120
Fernando valenzuela,
the baseball player?

15:29.190 --> 15:31.290
The beloved baseball player.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.630
Get ready to have
tons of friends.

15:33.690 --> 15:35.960
Please, just take me
to the talent show.

You're that guy.

15:58.850 --> 15:59.890
Say it.

15:59.950 --> 16:02.190
Shh. There's a kid onstage.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.290
I know. It's my kid.
Come on. Say it.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.490
- No.
- Just say it.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.000
I'm not going to say it.

As a matter of fact, I'm never
going to say it again. Ever.

from the science lab.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.510
I think they're scorpions.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.080
I'm not sure
what you should do with them.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.820
Maybe eat them, let them
run around on your face.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.150
Something like that.
