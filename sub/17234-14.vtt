WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:01.476
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.521 --> 00:04.312
That light was so bright,
it was like relief.

00:04.390 --> 00:05.806
I hate being this.

00:05.824 --> 00:08.642
Deacon Claybourne live at The Bluebird.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.943
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

00:09.978 --> 00:11.279
You want to take one of these?

00:11.313 --> 00:13.114
It's just like drinking
a few cups of coffee.

00:13.148 --> 00:15.266
Lamar Wyatt thought that
I was your star witness,

00:15.300 --> 00:16.417
but Tandy is.

00:16.452 --> 00:18.086
I'd rather see my father go free

00:18.120 --> 00:20.421
than to spend the rest of my
life looking over my shoulder.

00:20.456 --> 00:24.542
In a stunning turn of events,
Lamar Wyatt will be released.

00:24.593 --> 00:27.995
I realized that there is
one thing that I need... you.

00:30.182 --> 00:32.665
Ah, where is that thing?

00:32.683 --> 00:35.887
It's on your side.

00:40.025 --> 00:43.010
10 missed calls from Emily

00:43.028 --> 00:45.813
and an urgent text from your publicist.

00:45.847 --> 00:48.116
"Country-music titans
express outrage over"...

00:48.150 --> 00:49.784
just s... screw them.

00:49.818 --> 00:52.954
The world's made a sport
out of hating me, and I'm...

00:52.988 --> 00:55.123
I'm done with it.

00:55.157 --> 00:57.858
I'm just gonna stay off the grid.

00:57.876 --> 00:59.193
Right.

01:02.364 --> 01:04.331
Don't get it.

01:04.366 --> 01:06.834
- Don't get it.
- Juliette, it's my house.

01:06.868 --> 01:09.370
I'm getting the door.

01:11.206 --> 01:13.040
Hey!

01:13.058 --> 01:15.376
- I'm not here!
- Okay.

01:15.394 --> 01:17.512
Mr. Barkley.

01:17.546 --> 01:19.180
Deacon.

01:19.214 --> 01:21.516
You got a minute?

01:21.550 --> 01:24.352
Sure, hey, what's up?

01:24.386 --> 01:26.687
Well, uh, I was gonna
record my set tomorrow night

01:26.721 --> 01:28.889
for my "Live at The Bluebird" E.P.

01:28.907 --> 01:30.691
- Great idea.
- Well, thank you. I just...

01:30.725 --> 01:33.528
Erika tells me that Gunnar's, uh, quit,

01:33.562 --> 01:35.780
so he's not working on the
board anymore, but you are.

01:35.831 --> 01:37.198
- Is that right?
- Yep.

01:37.232 --> 01:39.116
Well, look, you know my
sound. You know my music.

01:39.168 --> 01:40.334
I was thinking...

01:40.369 --> 01:42.703
why don't you just engineer
this whole thing for me?

01:42.737 --> 01:44.622
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:44.673 --> 01:46.624
I'd love to.

01:46.675 --> 01:47.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:47.909 --> 01:49.260
All right, all right, well,
I got a shoestring budget,

01:49.294 --> 01:51.179
but I got a little bit of
money I can throw at you.

01:51.213 --> 01:52.680
I just...

01:52.714 --> 01:54.782
I want this thing to sound like
we're really at The Bluebird.

01:56.084 --> 01:59.153
Yeah, I hear you, and, hey  you know what?

01:59.188 --> 02:01.339
We could record the whole thing on analog,

02:01.373 --> 02:03.374
you know, record it live to two-track.

02:03.408 --> 02:05.676
Yes, yes, yes, all that. That's great.

02:05.727 --> 02:06.944
Great, so, uh,

02:06.979 --> 02:09.396
how about I meet up with
you later for a dry run?

02:09.431 --> 02:10.481
Okay.

02:12.651 --> 02:13.801
Hey.

02:15.521 --> 02:16.904
You been in touch with Juliette?

02:16.939 --> 02:18.839
- Uh, she's all right.
- Yeah?

02:18.874 --> 02:21.893
Yeah, just laying low, you
know, keeping her head down.

02:21.927 --> 02:24.562
She sure stirred up a hornet's
nest with that Opry performance.

02:24.596 --> 02:26.597
She's a hardheaded little
damn thing, isn't she?

02:26.648 --> 02:28.866
- All right, man, I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah, see you.

Good job, y'all.

03:09.241 --> 03:11.208
- Rayna, we got about 20 minutes till our next setup.
- Okay.

03:14.429 --> 03:15.930
- Looking great.
- Thanks, Robbie.

03:15.964 --> 03:17.198
- Hi!
- Hi.

03:17.232 --> 03:19.116
Why didn't you tell me you were flying in?

03:19.167 --> 03:20.635
I wanted to hop on a plane

03:20.669 --> 03:22.219
and see how the shooting was going.

03:22.254 --> 03:23.387
It's going.

03:23.422 --> 03:25.072
It's costing us a lot of money.

03:25.107 --> 03:26.841
Well, it has to. It's like you said.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.576
The first single off the label,
it's got to make a big splash.

03:29.595 --> 03:31.845
- Yeah. Fingers crossed.
- Yes.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.814
How are you? I missed you.

03:33.832 --> 03:35.466
The girls really missed you.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.134
- Mm.
- How was the spa?

03:37.185 --> 03:38.536
It was really nice.

03:38.570 --> 03:39.853
How's Luke?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.188
- He's good. He's good.
- Yeah?

03:41.206 --> 03:43.457
Yeah, he's, uh, back out
on tour for another week,

03:43.491 --> 03:44.909
which is probably a blessing.

03:44.943 --> 03:47.011
- Why?
- Since daddy's getting released.

03:48.213 --> 03:49.730
You know, I still don't understand

03:49.765 --> 03:51.082
what happened with all that.

03:51.116 --> 03:54.468
But then I figure, maybe
he's actually innocent.

03:54.503 --> 03:56.837
Wouldn't that be a pleasant surprise?

03:56.872 --> 03:59.357
Oh, my gosh, of course, the
girls are planning a big,

03:59.391 --> 04:01.676
you know, welcome-home
party for him this afternoon.

04:01.710 --> 04:03.494
This afternoon? Oh, sweetie,

04:03.528 --> 04:05.096
I can't. I have meetings. I have so many.

04:05.147 --> 04:07.698
No, no, no, don't you dare. Listen to me.

04:07.733 --> 04:10.751
I don't know what went
down between the two of you,

04:10.753 --> 04:13.270
but our father is coming home from prison.

04:13.322 --> 04:15.239
I'm not doing that by myself.

04:15.273 --> 04:16.974
We are gonna be a family, damn it.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.244
Good morning.

04:20.295 --> 04:21.562
Good morning!

04:21.596 --> 04:23.681
Oh. Hey.

04:23.732 --> 04:25.616
Hmm, what are you listening to?

04:25.667 --> 04:27.001
Demos.

04:27.035 --> 04:30.421
Edgehill sent over like 30
songs they want me to listen to.

04:30.472 --> 04:33.240
- Anything good?
- Not really.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.943
Apparently, my album drops May 1st.

04:35.977 --> 04:38.195
Against Rayna Jaymes' album.

04:38.263 --> 04:40.314
Hey, but that's a compliment, right?

04:40.348 --> 04:42.299
Label thinks you can take her on.

04:42.334 --> 04:43.684
Well, not with these demos, I can't.

04:43.719 --> 04:44.852
That's the problem with having

04:44.886 --> 04:46.404
a great song like "What if I was willin'?"

04:46.438 --> 04:48.489
It makes all these
others pale in comparison.

04:48.523 --> 04:51.759
Well, you know...

04:51.793 --> 04:53.661
seeing as you're looking...

04:53.695 --> 04:54.995
Huh?

04:55.029 --> 04:58.699
I wrote it after the whole Brent thing.

04:58.734 --> 05:02.253
"I've always been broken
underneath my smile.

05:02.287 --> 05:05.106
If I'm being honest, I
didn't stand a chance."

05:05.140 --> 05:07.458
Yeah, look, you got to have
more than just up-tempo stuff

05:07.492 --> 05:08.976
to round out the album, you know?

05:09.010 --> 05:11.945
Have a ballad in there. I'm not broken.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.731
And this isn't my brand.

05:14.733 --> 05:16.701
Dude, this is me you're talking to.

05:16.752 --> 05:19.203
Remember?

05:19.237 --> 05:21.572
Hey, you look nice.
Where, uh, where you going?

05:21.623 --> 05:23.974
Oh, I'm just headed out... errands.

05:24.009 --> 05:26.744
Okay, your hair looks
nice and different and...

05:26.795 --> 05:28.596
Thanks.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.097
O... okay.

05:32.801 --> 05:35.786
- Am I crazy, or was that weird?
- Yes.

05:35.821 --> 05:37.521
To both.

05:38.907 --> 05:41.108
The band's just playing
the hell out of the songs.

05:41.126 --> 05:43.294
I'll tell you something
about Avery Barkley, too.

05:43.345 --> 05:45.379
Boy knows what he's doing. Just perfect.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.281
You know, it's just such a great way

05:47.315 --> 05:49.834
to ease back into this craziness.

05:49.885 --> 05:52.420
It's just a little E.P.
at The Bluebird, you know?

05:52.454 --> 05:54.021
Well, that's great.

05:54.055 --> 05:56.390
Yeah, your enthusiasm...
it's really contagious.

05:56.408 --> 05:58.893
I just can't believe
they let Lamar Wyatt walk.

05:58.927 --> 06:00.294
Yeah, I can.

06:00.328 --> 06:02.813
This case got you all
wrapped up, doesn't it?

06:02.848 --> 06:04.782
Legal system's got so many loopholes

06:04.816 --> 06:07.001
that the law can't keep up with it anymore.

06:07.035 --> 06:08.903
I love when you talk dirty like that.

06:08.937 --> 06:10.871
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:10.906 --> 06:13.174
You are gonna rock a
recording at The Bluebird.

06:14.609 --> 06:15.810
How's that for enthusiasm?

06:15.844 --> 06:18.129
It's really good enthusiasm.
I want some more of it.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.847
Mm, sorry. Got to be at work.

06:21.266 --> 06:23.334
And I'm sorry I don't know
how late I'm gonna be tonight.

06:23.368 --> 06:24.702
Yeah, well, that's all right for tonight,

06:24.753 --> 06:26.286
but you got to promise to
be there tomorrow night.

06:26.304 --> 06:27.621
Oh, I will be there...

06:27.639 --> 06:29.623
in the front row enthusiastically.

06:29.641 --> 06:30.624
Hi.

06:30.693 --> 06:32.244
Hi, Scarlett. Bye, Scarlett.

06:32.295 --> 06:34.346
- Bye. Hello.
- Hey.

06:34.381 --> 06:36.999
I figured you moved out
and decided not to tell me.

06:37.017 --> 06:39.268
No, I, uh, I laid down
three more tracks with Liam.

06:39.302 --> 06:40.820
It was like my best vocals ever.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.221
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:42.255 --> 06:44.323
Uh, what does Megan
have front-row seats for?

06:44.357 --> 06:45.574
Should I be jealous?

06:45.642 --> 06:47.626
No, it's just my recording at The Bluebird.

06:47.661 --> 06:48.994
I know you're busy with Liam, so...

06:49.045 --> 06:51.213
No, no, he's... he's got to
go someplace with some people.

06:51.248 --> 06:52.748
Uh, I got Rayna's music video tomorrow,

06:52.766 --> 06:54.784
and then I'm coming to The Bluebird.

06:54.818 --> 06:57.319
Okay, busy girl, just make
sure you get some rest.

06:57.354 --> 06:59.321
I can't. I got songs pouring out of me.

06:59.356 --> 07:00.840
I got to keep up with them.

07:04.928 --> 07:06.562
Hi, everyone.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.364
You'll be asked about your
training and experience.

07:08.398 --> 07:11.467
And be sure to list any touring
and studio experience you have.

07:11.501 --> 07:13.152
Sophia Roxanne?

07:15.572 --> 07:17.656
Thanks.

07:17.691 --> 07:20.726
And, uh, Zoey Dalton.

07:20.777 --> 07:23.145
Just need your head shot and demo.

07:23.163 --> 07:26.665
Oh, um, I don't have those.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.784
Have you ever worked as
a backup singer before?

07:30.804 --> 07:33.038
Well, honey, come back when
you got your tools ready.

07:34.908 --> 07:37.693
Right.

07:39.162 --> 07:41.864
I'm just saying you might
want to prepare yourself.

07:41.898 --> 07:43.565
Why? Does he look that bad?

07:43.583 --> 07:45.668
Well, you know, he's lost weight.

07:45.702 --> 07:47.219
He looks frail.

07:47.254 --> 07:49.822
I mean, the man's been
locked up, for God sakes,

07:49.856 --> 07:52.024
and he had a heart
attack before that, so...

07:52.058 --> 07:53.659
Well, he's not the man he used to be.

07:53.710 --> 07:54.776
He's here!

07:54.795 --> 07:56.612
All right, well, now
y'all don't smother him.

07:56.630 --> 07:58.347
Just... just don't bounce off the walls.

07:58.381 --> 07:59.515
We can hug him, right?

07:59.549 --> 08:01.317
Yeah, of course you can hug him.

08:07.007 --> 08:08.057
Grandpa!

08:08.091 --> 08:09.375
Hello, ladies.

08:09.426 --> 08:11.026
Mm!

08:11.061 --> 08:13.162
Mm! Pa-paw.

08:13.196 --> 08:17.232
- Hi, daddy.
- Oh, I missed you.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.701
Hey.

08:18.735 --> 08:20.419
- How you doing, Tandy?
- Hi, daddy.

08:20.453 --> 08:22.037
Haven't seen hide nor hair of you

08:22.071 --> 08:23.506
since your one and only visit.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.424
I know. I'm sorry. I've just been so busy.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.760
Well, why don't we get inside
where it's nice and warm?

08:27.794 --> 08:29.929
Oh, shoot, you know, I have to run.

08:29.963 --> 08:32.464
I got a million things to do,
and you probably want to rest.

08:32.515 --> 08:34.133
You're not gonna stay for a bite?

08:34.183 --> 08:35.551
Well, you want your company up and running,

08:35.585 --> 08:37.019
and we'll have dinner
this week or something.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.304
Hey, hey.

08:38.355 --> 08:40.972
You said you were gonna stay for this.

08:41.024 --> 08:42.942
I'm sorry. I can't.

That is the most beautiful

09:48.285 --> 09:49.919
- Thank y'all.
- And we made you cookies.

09:49.953 --> 09:51.103
You did?

09:51.121 --> 09:52.771
We did.

09:52.789 --> 09:54.106
Well, I will have one.

09:54.124 --> 09:57.076
And, um, how about a big old glass of milk?

09:57.110 --> 09:58.127
Okay.

09:58.161 --> 10:01.764
They have been practicing like crazy.

10:01.798 --> 10:04.116
I don't know why they'd have
to. They got your talent.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.285
Unlike your sister.

10:06.303 --> 10:09.288
You know, she... she never
once looked me in the eye today.

10:09.322 --> 10:11.507
Well, listen, I think it's gonna take

10:11.541 --> 10:13.676
a little time for all of us to heal.

10:17.597 --> 10:19.481
Wait. You're leaving?

10:19.516 --> 10:21.433
Yeah, got to go wrangle the equipment

10:21.484 --> 10:23.269
for Deacon's show at The Bluebird.

10:23.303 --> 10:25.437
I made toast.

10:26.940 --> 10:31.076
Uh, that's not toast.
That's, uh, lukewarm bread.

10:31.111 --> 10:34.096
I had to microwave it. I
couldn't find your toaster.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.981
That's 'cause I don't have a toaster.

10:38.151 --> 10:43.122
You sure I can't entice you into
staying a little while longer?

10:43.156 --> 10:46.375
I'll watch that weird
Sci-Fi movie with you.

10:46.426 --> 10:49.378
It's Fellini, not Sci-Fi.

10:49.429 --> 10:52.381
And do you really want
me to piss Deacon off?

10:52.432 --> 10:54.266
Yes.

10:54.301 --> 10:55.601
No.

10:55.635 --> 10:57.636
- No?
- No.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.638
See you soon.

11:04.561 --> 11:06.111
You know, Layla,

11:06.146 --> 11:07.496
you don't have to buy
groceries for the house.

11:07.530 --> 11:09.014
I have to contribute
something around here hello.

11:09.032 --> 11:10.282
- 'Cause you won't let me pay any money.
- Hey, we're in here.

11:10.317 --> 11:11.700
Think fast.

11:11.735 --> 11:12.785
Oh! Whoop!

11:12.819 --> 11:15.871
- How was errand running?
- Fine.

11:15.906 --> 11:17.039
Hey.

11:17.073 --> 11:18.407
Hi.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.075
It's kind of a full house, right?

11:20.126 --> 11:22.378
Well, I can take care
of that. I got to split.

11:22.412 --> 11:25.214
Laying down some vocals
on my boy Gunnar's track.

11:25.248 --> 11:27.216
- Meet me at the studio?
- I'll see you there in a while.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.467
Hey, I haven't gotten to tell you, uh,

11:28.501 --> 11:29.668
"American Hitmaker" called.

11:29.702 --> 11:31.804
They're flying me to L.A. tomorrow

11:31.838 --> 11:33.806
to debut my next single
on the top-10 show.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.874
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah, congratulations.

11:35.892 --> 11:37.643
Yeah, that's awesome.

11:37.677 --> 11:38.877
What, no kiss?

11:38.895 --> 11:40.379
I'm going to L.A.

11:40.397 --> 11:41.680
Walk me out.

11:41.714 --> 11:43.148
I got to split.

11:43.183 --> 11:45.651
I'm gonna swing by music row
before meeting up with Will.

11:45.685 --> 11:47.403
You got anything exciting happening?

11:47.437 --> 11:48.904
Just work.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.572
Okay, well, have fun with that.

11:50.607 --> 11:52.992
Mwah. See you later.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.399
Avery.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.584
I have to find Juliette.

12:02.619 --> 12:04.586
Everything is blowing up.
She's completely M.I.A.

12:04.621 --> 12:06.088
Do you have any idea where she is?

12:07.540 --> 12:09.191
- I haven't seen her.
- Really?

12:14.180 --> 12:17.499
Great, well, thanks for your help.

12:19.786 --> 12:21.520
Well, I know putting Scarlett in

12:21.554 --> 12:23.388
is gonna cost us a little bit more,

12:23.406 --> 12:24.990
but I do think it's... oh.

12:25.024 --> 12:26.175
Uh, hey, buck, can I call you right back?

12:26.209 --> 12:27.309
Call you right back. Bye.

12:27.344 --> 12:28.610
Hey.

12:28.701 --> 12:30.468
Is there anybody else here? I
mean, are the girls home yet?

12:30.503 --> 12:32.153
Uh, no. What's going on?

12:32.188 --> 12:34.205
I thought there were security concerns.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.490
Yeah, listen.

12:35.508 --> 12:38.326
There's something you really
need to know about your father

12:38.360 --> 12:40.028
before you get too close to him.

12:40.062 --> 12:41.996
Lamar's responsible for Peggy's death.

12:42.031 --> 12:44.599
- What?
- You see, he targeted me

12:44.633 --> 12:47.368
because he thought I was
cooperating with the prosecution.

12:47.402 --> 12:51.222
He thought that I turned him in,
that I was their star witness,

12:51.273 --> 12:53.241
so he ordered that man to shoot me,

12:53.275 --> 12:55.794
and instead my wife died
for nothing because...

12:55.828 --> 12:57.045
- Hold on...
- It wasn't me.

12:57.079 --> 12:58.463
I didn't know enough about Lamar's business

12:58.497 --> 13:00.148
to tip off the feds, much
less talk to them about it,

13:00.182 --> 13:01.483
but she did.

13:01.517 --> 13:03.068
- Who? I don't know what you're t...
- So I don't want...

13:03.102 --> 13:05.052
I don't want our girls
anywhere near either of them.

13:05.071 --> 13:06.554
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hold on!
- You understand?

13:06.605 --> 13:08.156
I know you're grieving

13:08.190 --> 13:11.326
and... and you're trying to
make sense of all this, but I...

13:11.360 --> 13:12.994
I mean, this sounds crazy.

13:13.028 --> 13:15.864
Ask your sister why she didn't
testify on Lamar's behalf.

13:15.898 --> 13:18.533
Ask her what your father is capable of

13:18.567 --> 13:20.251
because she knows better than anybody.

13:25.546 --> 13:28.281
♪ baby, baby, baby-y-y ♪

13:28.315 --> 13:31.951

- ♪ What if I... ♪
- Could we give it another pass?

13:42.830 --> 13:44.580
Hold up. Let me check your mike.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.149
Think you're too hot.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.686
Thinks you're too hot.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.256
- Right?
- Hey, guys.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.524
How's the session going?

13:54.558 --> 13:55.672
Fine.

13:55.676 --> 13:58.828
Jeff sent me over. He wants to
know your thoughts on the demos.

13:58.863 --> 14:00.630
Gotta start locking down
tracks for the album.

14:00.664 --> 14:03.416
Yeah, I'm not really feeling
anything in that batch.

14:03.450 --> 14:06.202
Come on, Will, some of
those songs are great.

14:06.253 --> 14:07.837
Yeah, well, I don't like 'em.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.456
And I'm the one singing
them, so keep looking.

14:10.491 --> 14:14.127
Okay. We'll send over some more songs.

14:14.161 --> 14:16.412
Mm.

14:16.447 --> 14:18.448
You know, you're kidding yourself

14:18.482 --> 14:20.666
if you think you got
this thing under control.

14:20.684 --> 14:24.270
I'm telling you, man,
anybody in a 10-foot radius

14:24.305 --> 14:26.138
can tell there's something
going on between you two.

14:40.487 --> 14:42.521
I know you're here, Juliette.

14:48.228 --> 14:50.396
How many calls do I not have to answer

14:50.431 --> 14:51.881
before you get the message?

14:51.932 --> 14:53.533
How did you know I was here?

14:53.567 --> 14:56.402
Avery's a terrible liar.
Why are you ignoring me?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.605
Because I'm quitting everything.

14:58.639 --> 15:00.690
Before everyone quits you.

15:00.724 --> 15:01.941
I guess you figured out

15:01.976 --> 15:04.344
that country radio is dumping
you from their playlist.

15:04.378 --> 15:07.680
Stop talking! I don't
know. I don't want to know.

15:07.715 --> 15:09.265
This is my life now.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.651
What? It's a nice apartment.

15:12.993 --> 15:14.194
If you need references,

15:14.228 --> 15:16.346
I'll call and talk to whoever you want.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.281
I am not looking for another job.

15:18.315 --> 15:20.183
I work for you.

15:20.217 --> 15:21.851
Let me take you home. No.

15:24.371 --> 15:26.839
But you can help me with something.

15:29.844 --> 15:33.246
Oh, I see why you had to
leave daddy's in such a hurry.

15:33.264 --> 15:34.864
You had to go get a haircut.

15:34.899 --> 15:37.116
Among other things.

15:37.134 --> 15:39.169
Looks nice.

15:39.203 --> 15:40.687
Thanks.

15:40.721 --> 15:42.622
I filed our letters of incorporation.

15:42.656 --> 15:46.092
I got all our bank accounts
set. You just need to sign these.

15:48.145 --> 15:50.413
Teddy came by here a little while ago.

15:50.464 --> 15:53.316
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

15:53.367 --> 15:56.302
He had some real strange
things to say about you.

15:56.337 --> 15:57.854
Really?

15:57.888 --> 16:01.107
He says you're responsible
for daddy's prosecution.

16:02.776 --> 16:04.076
Are you?

16:06.430 --> 16:08.348
They'd already set their sights on him.

16:08.382 --> 16:10.166
I just provided a little information.

16:10.217 --> 16:11.501
So, suddenly it's so important to you

16:11.552 --> 16:12.902
to have our father arrested for fraud?

16:12.937 --> 16:14.520
- I...
- What, did they have something on you?

16:14.538 --> 16:17.056
I wanted him punished.

16:17.091 --> 16:18.942
Why?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.078
He's responsible for mom's death.

16:22.112 --> 16:24.914
It wasn't an accident. He ran
her off the road that night.

16:24.949 --> 16:27.500
- He was in Louisville that night.
- No, he wasn't.

16:27.534 --> 16:29.919
How do you know?

16:29.954 --> 16:34.173
I found out right before he was arrested.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.842
You found out and you didn't tell me?

16:35.876 --> 16:37.510
The U.S. attorney approached me,

16:37.528 --> 16:39.329
and I was forbidden from telling you.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.464
Everybody in this family is a damn liar!

16:41.498 --> 16:43.483
No, I'm sor...

16:58.198 --> 16:59.649
Hey.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.467
Thank you for coming down here.

17:01.501 --> 17:03.536
Yeah. You said it was important.

17:03.570 --> 17:05.954
I... I don't even know how to put this.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.640
Hey, hey. Tell me what's going on.

17:08.826 --> 17:12.979
I don't think, uh, me
and Brent are connecting.

17:13.012 --> 17:16.132
I mean, he doesn't see me

17:16.165 --> 17:18.300
for who I am or who I want to be.

17:18.335 --> 17:21.320
Was he inappropriate in any way?

17:21.355 --> 17:24.173
Well, it makes me uncomfortable.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.791
Right.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.727
And, I mean, on top of that,

17:27.761 --> 17:30.262
he's picking all the wrong demos for me.

17:30.281 --> 17:33.099
There's got to be somebody
else you can throw on my team.

17:36.870 --> 17:42.158
Listen, will, you are a massive
part of Edgehill's future.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.327
I will look after you personally,

17:44.378 --> 17:46.412
and I'll take care of Brent, okay?

17:46.447 --> 17:47.997
Thank you. I appreciate it.

17:48.032 --> 17:49.966
Absolutely.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.567
Hey, now... now focus.

17:51.602 --> 17:53.152
Focus on finding songs.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.271
May 1st will be here before we know it.

18:01.178 --> 18:02.795
Hey.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.547
I'm gonna move back to my house.

18:04.598 --> 18:06.182
If that's what you want to do.

18:09.803 --> 18:11.821
Listen, after the U.S. attorney told me

18:11.872 --> 18:14.573
that daddy may have something
to do with mom's death,

18:14.591 --> 18:17.910
I hired a private
investigator to look into it.

18:19.129 --> 18:21.280
That's the report.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.034
I'm not lying now.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.672
Whole damn thing's surreal.

18:29.707 --> 18:31.007
I mean, Lamar's at home

18:31.041 --> 18:33.459
probably drinking his third scotch by now,

18:33.494 --> 18:35.028
gloating as he always does.

18:35.062 --> 18:36.612
I don't think this is over yet.

18:36.647 --> 18:39.182
What do you mean? He's untouchable.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.435
Federal agents contacted me,

18:42.469 --> 18:44.420
wanting details about Stoffel's case.

18:44.455 --> 18:46.439
They think there's some validity

18:46.473 --> 18:48.674
to your theory that Lamar's involved.

18:48.709 --> 18:49.942
It's more than a theory.

18:49.977 --> 18:51.494
I know. That's why they're
digging for evidence.

18:51.528 --> 18:53.463
'Cause if they can't find
evidence of corruption,

18:53.497 --> 18:55.714
how the hell are they gonna
prove that he ordered a hit?

18:55.733 --> 18:58.401
Peggy deserves better.

18:58.435 --> 18:59.769
I know.

18:59.820 --> 19:01.838
Don't lose hope.

19:03.824 --> 19:05.007
Hey.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.994
What the hell's going on here?

19:08.028 --> 19:10.046
- What, are you his lawyer now, too?!
- No, I'm not.

19:10.097 --> 19:11.347
Okay, look, Deacon, just calm down.

19:11.382 --> 19:12.782
- We're friends, okay?
- You're friends?

19:12.833 --> 19:14.016
- Yeah.
- Yes, let me explain.

19:14.051 --> 19:15.668
- I... I should go.
- Yeah, you should go.

19:15.702 --> 19:17.587
Thank you for the information.

19:17.621 --> 19:19.188
Of course. I'll let you
know what I find out.

19:25.095 --> 19:26.896
What you gonna let him know?

19:26.930 --> 19:29.882
That is privileged information.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.434
The kind that requires y'all to hold hands?

19:31.468 --> 19:34.003
He is upset about his wife's death.

19:35.355 --> 19:37.407
He's a part of this big case
that I've been working on.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.293
Wait. He's the big...

19:40.327 --> 19:42.095
he's the reason you've been staying out

19:42.129 --> 19:43.513
all these hours late at night?!

19:43.564 --> 19:45.998
Yes, I have been helping him, yes.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.551
'Cause I understand
what he's going through.

19:48.585 --> 19:50.503
Are you some kind of, like...

19:50.570 --> 19:52.422
tragedy junkie or something?

19:52.456 --> 19:53.923
- Is that what it is?
- Excuse me?

19:53.957 --> 19:55.741
No, no, that's it, right?
That's why you're with me.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.076
I'm this hot-headed alkie

19:57.094 --> 19:59.879
that you, uh, seduced to
fulfill your savior complex.

19:59.913 --> 20:01.297
What... what are you talking about?!

20:01.348 --> 20:03.749
I'm talking about you latching
on to people that got problems

20:03.767 --> 20:05.384
so you can feel better about yourself!

20:05.418 --> 20:06.636
That's what I'm talking about!

20:06.670 --> 20:08.938
You can leave now.

20:08.972 --> 20:10.640
You're right. I can.

20:10.691 --> 20:12.225
I will.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.946
♪ People say and, honey, people do ♪

20:21.013 --> 20:25.650
♪ and there's a difference
between the two ♪

20:25.718 --> 20:30.556
♪ we know what's right
and we know what is wrong ♪

20:30.623 --> 20:35.026
♪ but it all runs
together before too long ♪

20:35.094 --> 20:37.495
I didn't cook it, but I ordered it.

20:37.563 --> 20:39.698
What the hell have you
done to my apartment?

20:41.505 --> 20:44.158
I don't need you to buy me things.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.210
It's a... couch and a bed.

20:46.362 --> 20:48.663
Yeah, and a table and foofy pillows.

20:48.731 --> 20:51.332
I mean, I liked my old couch.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.602
Those pillows are unisex!

20:53.669 --> 20:56.004
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, listen, listen, listen.

20:57.573 --> 21:00.021
I totally understand
the instinct to hide out,

21:00.089 --> 21:02.290
but you can't be afraid of those people.

21:02.357 --> 21:04.260
I'm not afraid of them.

21:05.787 --> 21:07.226
I just feel like...

21:08.984 --> 21:10.804
All I have left is you.

21:10.924 --> 21:14.371
You are the only one who
can change the conversation,

21:14.491 --> 21:17.224
and you sure as hell can't
do that cooped up in here.

21:20.027 --> 21:21.897
There is no conversation.

21:37.745 --> 21:38.896
So, look, the bottom line is

21:38.921 --> 21:40.692
we've just lost two of
our top-grossing artists,

21:40.729 --> 21:42.963
and so the pressure is on
to keep our artists happy

21:43.083 --> 21:44.596
and to launch the next generation.

21:44.809 --> 21:47.518
Agreed. So, what do you need from me?

21:49.902 --> 21:51.184
We need to cut you loose.

21:52.749 --> 21:53.743
What?

21:54.044 --> 21:57.103
The talent is not comfortable around you.

21:58.673 --> 22:01.283
I've been nothing but professional.

22:01.308 --> 22:02.859
You'll receive a good severance

22:02.884 --> 22:04.923
- after you sign a nondisclosure.
- Five years

22:05.043 --> 22:07.302
and... and leaving my
life in L.A., and this is

22:07.371 --> 22:08.937
- what I get?
- It's not personal.

22:08.987 --> 22:10.995
It's business. I have
to protect my artists.

22:11.189 --> 22:12.328
I'm sorry, man.

22:28.291 --> 22:29.898
Crap, oh, crap, crap!

22:29.929 --> 22:32.595
One of the other partners is
taking over the Stoffel case.

22:32.607 --> 22:34.509
I can't do it anymore.

22:34.629 --> 22:36.505
It's because of Deacon, isn't it?

22:36.530 --> 22:38.185
Because it's unprofessional.

22:38.253 --> 22:41.221
Deacon is connected to
Maddie and the Wyatt family.

22:41.289 --> 22:42.724
I thought I could manage,

22:42.749 --> 22:45.151
but the demands of the case
have become too much for me.

22:45.176 --> 22:47.235
I just want you to know that

22:47.355 --> 22:48.730
I feel like you're the only person

22:48.755 --> 22:50.795
I can really talk to about all of this.

22:51.098 --> 22:52.422
You know?

22:53.135 --> 22:54.825
Well, you'll find someone else.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.354
You just have to be open to it.

23:04.898 --> 23:06.994
- Oh, hey, Brent. Come in.
- Hey, man.

23:07.588 --> 23:09.140
Hey, you riding to the airport with me?

23:09.172 --> 23:10.786
No. Um,

23:10.906 --> 23:12.988
- Jeff just fired me.
- Wait. What?

23:13.251 --> 23:14.340
Why?

23:14.402 --> 23:16.542
He says I'm not a good fit.

23:17.975 --> 23:19.727
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

23:19.775 --> 23:21.960
That... that's crazy.
I'm gonna call him, okay?

23:21.992 --> 23:23.230
Will, we have to call Jeff, right?

23:23.249 --> 23:24.563
Uh, I think your car's here.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.789
I'll be fine.

23:26.778 --> 23:28.611
Knock 'em dead out in L.A.

23:30.525 --> 23:32.401
Thank you for everything.

23:32.427 --> 23:33.891
Okay, take care.

23:37.797 --> 23:40.392
Sorry to hear that, man. Really.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.663
Thanks.

23:44.472 --> 23:46.862
Well, I guess you got what you wanted.

23:47.356 --> 23:48.695
I don't know what you mean.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.315
I'm really good at my job.

23:50.435 --> 23:52.004
I'm gonna be more than okay.

23:52.124 --> 23:55.427
But you just lost your
biggest ally at Edgehill.

23:55.689 --> 23:58.286
I guess I'll have to look
after myself from now on.

23:58.711 --> 24:00.344
Good luck with that.

24:09.079 --> 24:11.475
So, you had him fired?

24:11.819 --> 24:13.665
I didn't mean to.

24:14.497 --> 24:16.668
I just didn't want him around me.

24:17.337 --> 24:19.702
You said yourself people
could tell there was a problem.

24:19.734 --> 24:22.042
So you think one guy is a problem?

24:22.162 --> 24:24.057
What, remove that guy,
and, hey, everything's cool!

24:24.079 --> 24:24.811
Yeah, exactly.

24:24.842 --> 24:26.281
Dude, you tried to kiss me!

24:29.615 --> 24:32.306
Look, I know things have been strange

24:32.506 --> 24:33.895
lately,  but it's over.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.290
I know what I want,

24:35.346 --> 24:37.499
and I'm not gonna let
anybody get in my way.

24:37.619 --> 24:40.264
Yeah. I can see that.

24:44.976 --> 24:46.064
Hey.

24:46.089 --> 24:47.453
Hey.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.718
A... are you feeling all right?

24:49.838 --> 24:51.896
Yeah, I'm fine. I just, uh...

24:52.016 --> 24:53.954
I've been working really
late nights on the album.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.488
- I'm good.
- Good, 'cause they need you at rehearsal.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.320
Okay.

24:57.389 --> 24:59.710
Uh, would you guys mind
giving me just a minute?

24:59.754 --> 25:00.837
Thank you.

25:01.019 --> 25:03.440
I'm not... wait. I'm not
holding Rayna up, am I?

25:03.465 --> 25:05.367
No, it's just your part today.

25:05.487 --> 25:07.144
She's at home with family.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.090
Not a lot of room on this couch

25:26.108 --> 25:27.685
with all these pillows.

25:28.824 --> 25:32.046
They're italiano. Like the movie.

25:33.310 --> 25:34.880
That's French.

25:35.121 --> 25:35.825
Hmm.

25:39.442 --> 25:40.461
All right.

25:41.199 --> 25:43.307
- You have to go?
- Yeah.

25:43.364 --> 25:45.679
Deacon's show is at
8:00, and I got to set up.

25:46.798 --> 25:48.200
Why don't you come with me?

25:48.807 --> 25:50.471
No thank you.

25:50.738 --> 25:53.286
Juliette, you're gonna
go stir-crazy in here.

25:53.937 --> 25:55.914
I got all your artsy-fartsy films

25:55.945 --> 25:57.816
that I don't understand
to get through. I'll be...

25:57.936 --> 25:58.948
Fine.

26:00.381 --> 26:01.939
All right, well...

26:02.164 --> 26:03.516
I'm gonna miss you.

26:07.552 --> 26:09.992
You know, just because
you close your eyes...

26:10.823 --> 26:12.624
Doesn't mean you're invisible.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.376
Hello, Rayna.

26:39.906 --> 26:42.040
Did you kill my mother?

26:43.735 --> 26:45.418
Your mother and I were
fighting about Watty.

26:46.645 --> 26:48.749
She came down with her bags packed.

26:50.323 --> 26:52.276
I figured she'd get about
halfway down the driveway

26:52.307 --> 26:53.896
and turn around.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.268
But she didn't.

26:58.696 --> 27:00.434
She meant it this time.

27:00.829 --> 27:03.388
I had to go after her.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.147
Beg her just to come back to me.

27:07.172 --> 27:09.180
I couldn't let her go, Rayna.

27:10.241 --> 27:12.421
I loved her too much to lose her.

27:12.966 --> 27:15.280
She must've seen me
in her rear-view mirror

27:15.305 --> 27:17.075
because she sped up, and...

27:17.488 --> 27:18.871
Of course, so did I.

27:18.927 --> 27:22.375
She was going so fast. She lost control.

27:22.495 --> 27:24.746
So you saw her crash.

27:25.922 --> 27:28.663
But you didn't get help.
You didn't do anything.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.565
Oh, I tried.

27:31.866 --> 27:35.927
I ran down to her car. She'd
gone over this embankment.

27:38.129 --> 27:40.663
But when I got there...

27:42.377 --> 27:44.711
There was nothing I could do.

27:46.294 --> 27:48.546
She was already...

27:49.385 --> 27:51.931
She was already gone.

27:54.534 --> 27:56.037
And then you just went off to Louisville

27:56.042 --> 27:57.149
and just lied about it.

27:57.193 --> 27:58.826
I just panicked.

28:00.503 --> 28:02.993
I left her there...

28:03.937 --> 28:07.203
Alone on the side of the r... road.

28:21.349 --> 28:22.913
Hey, what's going on with you?

28:23.257 --> 28:24.533
Nothing.

28:25.146 --> 28:26.316
Look, I'm...

28:26.436 --> 28:28.843
I'm sorry if I've been so busy lately.

28:28.887 --> 28:32.585
No, it's not you. I'm
just frustrated, I guess.

28:32.705 --> 28:33.873
About what?

28:34.706 --> 28:38.861
I mean, you, Scarlett, Avery, Will,

28:38.873 --> 28:41.300
you guys all have these awesome
things that you're doing,

28:41.343 --> 28:42.851
you know, and I don't.

28:43.252 --> 28:45.679
A year ago, I was sitting in Natchez,

28:45.799 --> 28:47.517
and I realized I had to get out of there

28:47.518 --> 28:49.808
because I didn't want to
be that girl who never left.

28:49.839 --> 28:52.942
But is sitting around
in Nashville any better?

28:52.980 --> 28:55.007
It's not like you're not doing anything.

28:55.407 --> 28:56.922
Gunnar, I'm a waitress.

28:56.947 --> 28:58.773
Well, and you're my girlfriend.

29:00.769 --> 29:03.178
Look, y... you're thinking
about this all wrong, okay?

29:03.298 --> 29:05.067
You did it. You got out of Natchez.

29:05.086 --> 29:06.156
And to the tune of working

29:06.187 --> 29:08.389
in one of country music's
most revered venues.

29:08.509 --> 29:10.047
You got a front-row seat.

29:10.504 --> 29:13.195
I don't think I want a
front-row seat anymore.

29:13.258 --> 29:14.828
Look...

29:14.948 --> 29:17.762
there are  hundreds of people

29:17.780 --> 29:20.771
who would kill to have your job, your life.

29:21.879 --> 29:24.757
But when you think it's
time for something new...

29:25.358 --> 29:27.022
I'll be there, okay?

29:27.460 --> 29:29.574
Hey, guys. Listen up a sec.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.633
Listen, I'm striking the
first song from the set.

29:31.664 --> 29:34.204
I'm just gonna... not play the first one.

29:34.254 --> 29:35.962
- All right.
- Yeah.

29:36.144 --> 29:38.008
What's wrong with the opener?

29:38.715 --> 29:40.092
Just not feeling that one.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.488
What are you talking about?
It's a killer love song.

29:42.525 --> 29:43.495
Thank you.

29:43.914 --> 29:45.153
Not playing it.

29:48.137 --> 29:49.057
Okay.

29:50.746 --> 29:53.456
You're staking a lot on this E.P.

29:53.956 --> 29:56.734
So you should either fix
what's bothering you...

29:57.031 --> 29:59.737
or get over it before we start recording.

Oh, you might want to not do that here.

30:42.596 --> 30:44.573
God knows what they'll throw at me next.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.094
No, I'm gonna do that when
I want and where I want.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.634
You were right about hiding out.

30:49.853 --> 30:53.143
Turns out I hate being invisible
more than I hate being wrong.

30:54.814 --> 30:55.621
Scarlett.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.928
- Hey.

30:57.191 --> 30:58.261

30:59.938 --> 31:01.333
It's really nice to see you guys.

31:01.370 --> 31:03.460
Um, enjoy the show. You look fantastic.

31:03.817 --> 31:05.332
That was friendly.

31:05.399 --> 31:07.321
And totally weird.

31:07.853 --> 31:09.602
Oh, wow, your hair!

31:10.193 --> 31:11.595
Uh, it's so glamorous.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.788
- Thank you.
- How are you?

31:13.908 --> 31:15.667
I'm okay. Good.

31:15.711 --> 31:17.770
Can I please have a Tequila and pineapple

31:17.820 --> 31:20.016
and, um, one of those
things of sweet potato fries?

31:20.066 --> 31:22.005
- Sure.
- Thank you.

31:26.222 --> 31:27.279
Hey.

31:27.573 --> 31:28.406
Hi.

31:30.095 --> 31:31.747
I didn't think you were gonna come.

31:31.809 --> 31:33.367
I didn't think you'd call.

31:33.755 --> 31:35.701
That was a nice message.

31:35.821 --> 31:38.078
I'm sorry. I just got
caught off guard there.

31:38.109 --> 31:39.842
No, you were right.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.658
I do like to save people.

31:42.778 --> 31:44.298
That's how we met.

31:44.823 --> 31:47.057
But it's not why I love you.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.705
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

31:50.730 --> 31:53.045
and welcome to a very special night

31:53.088 --> 31:54.990
at the Bluebird Café.

31:56.868 --> 31:58.007
I gave up the case,

31:58.038 --> 32:00.440
- so I won't be talking to Teddy anymore.
- You didn't have to do that.

32:00.472 --> 32:01.786
- I want more time for us.
- We're making a live recording.

32:01.906 --> 32:04.476
- Make an album.
- And I want to welcome our special guest tonight,

32:04.477 --> 32:06.297
our very own Deacon Claybourne.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.162
Thank you, Erika.

32:08.362 --> 32:10.239
Thank you, everybody.

32:10.487 --> 32:12.155
Most of y'all know my story.

32:12.448 --> 32:14.869
Had some, uh, rough patches along the road.

32:15.182 --> 32:16.947
Wasn't too long ago that in, uh,

32:16.978 --> 32:18.928
one of my darkest times,

32:18.995 --> 32:20.143
uh, an angel appeared.

32:20.187 --> 32:21.776
I'd like to do this first one for her.

differently, should've done.

33:52.971 --> 33:54.723
But I acted out of love for your mother.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.237
You have to believe that.

33:56.531 --> 33:59.572
Yeah, I don't really know
what I believe anymore.

34:03.544 --> 34:05.139
I mean, you just...

34:05.208 --> 34:08.099
just lied about this... this whole time.

34:08.149 --> 34:09.601
And Tandy...

34:10.127 --> 34:11.315
Wait a minute. Is this...

34:11.435 --> 34:13.493
is this why she's so angry with me?

34:13.837 --> 34:16.101
I mean, does she blame me
now for your mother's death?

34:16.132 --> 34:17.929
Well, you were involved.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.120
I mean, maybe not
intentionally, but you were.

34:21.163 --> 34:22.420
Don't you think

34:22.541 --> 34:25.159
that I feel the guilt of
that every day of my life?

34:25.799 --> 34:28.772
Maybe this is a blessing
that it's out in the open.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.623
Maybe we can get past it now,

34:30.655 --> 34:32.257
the three of us, and find some peace.

34:32.288 --> 34:33.958
That's all I want now.

34:34.509 --> 34:36.092
That all you want now?

34:37.956 --> 34:40.259
'Cause you know what I
want? I want the truth.

34:42.237 --> 34:44.882
Did you have anything to
do with Peggy's murder?

34:45.409 --> 34:47.335
Why would you even ask such a thing?

34:47.367 --> 34:48.668
Did you think that

34:48.675 --> 34:51.346
Teddy was responsible for your prosecution?

34:51.553 --> 34:53.266
Oh, I have no doubt about that.

34:53.297 --> 34:55.168
Did you hire that man to shoot at Teddy?

34:55.206 --> 34:57.540
I didn't hire anyone to do anything.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.867
- I was in jail.
- Oh, I know you were in jail.

34:59.987 --> 35:01.500
Did you have somebody else do it for you?

35:01.525 --> 35:03.133
Did you have Albert do it for you?

35:03.253 --> 35:05.604
The shooter obviously had his own reasons

35:05.629 --> 35:07.875
- for hating Teddy.
- Dad, dad, did you do it?!

35:08.063 --> 35:09.620
He didn't need any prodding

35:09.639 --> 35:11.529
- from me or anyone else!
- You're not even denying this!

35:11.554 --> 35:12.868
What is it that you want me to do?

35:12.911 --> 35:15.620
I don't want you to deny it! I
want you to tell me the truth!

35:18.437 --> 35:21.764
Did you try to murder the
father of my children?!

35:28.281 --> 35:29.597
I don't want you near me.

35:29.615 --> 35:31.318
I don't want you near
my children ever again.

35:31.355 --> 35:33.808

I ever imagined it. It's...

37:07.559 --> 37:09.176
perfect for you.

37:10.718 --> 37:13.396
You're the only who's
ever gonna hear me sing it.

37:17.288 --> 37:20.235
- All right.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:20.285 --> 37:22.218
Thanks. It was really nice to meet you.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.702
Oh, so good!

37:24.752 --> 37:27.073
- Yeah?
- So, so good.

37:28.068 --> 37:29.263
Yeah.

37:29.702 --> 37:32.386
- Think so?
- Oh, look at me. I'm a mess.

37:32.423 --> 37:33.712
You look good to me.

37:33.832 --> 37:36.190
- I'm gonna freshen up.
- All right.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.371
Well, looky here.

37:41.421 --> 37:42.679
Ah!

37:42.799 --> 37:44.512
That was an amazing show.

37:44.535 --> 37:46.569
To think I almost didn't come.

37:46.689 --> 37:48.596
Yeah, well, I'm so glad you did.

37:48.608 --> 37:51.149
Never want to stay too long
at a pity party, you know?

37:51.718 --> 37:53.164
A pity party's about the only invitation

37:53.195 --> 37:55.135
- I can get these days.
- Don't you let them

37:55.173 --> 37:56.155
get you.

37:56.180 --> 37:57.813
You've been given a voice, girl.

37:57.933 --> 37:59.164
You just keep saying what you believe,

37:59.183 --> 38:00.553
and you're gonna be fine.

38:00.572 --> 38:01.598
Hmm.

38:01.623 --> 38:02.912
Deacon, you killed it, man.

38:02.937 --> 38:04.126
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!

38:04.151 --> 38:06.686
- We get it?
- You know, it's like pure bottled Bluebird.

38:06.723 --> 38:08.594
It's gonna sound great.

38:08.638 --> 38:10.728
That's all I wanted.

38:11.528 --> 38:13.312
So, is this a...

38:14.688 --> 38:16.496
I like it.

38:18.692 --> 38:20.193
Yeah.

38:23.684 --> 38:26.305
You know, I think we need
to get back in the studio.

38:26.324 --> 38:28.376
We wrote a great song.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.896
You're a hell of a producer.

38:29.909 --> 38:32.868
We... we need to do more of that.

38:33.162 --> 38:35.164
Oh, I think that's a fine idea.

38:35.451 --> 38:37.460
- Good.
- Just one thing.

38:37.580 --> 38:38.955
What?

38:39.387 --> 38:42.102
I want all my furniture back.

38:44.442 --> 38:46.169
Hey. Thank you.

38:46.225 --> 38:48.728
Hey, are you... okay?

38:48.848 --> 38:51.106
Yeah, I'm... great.

38:51.156 --> 38:53.671
I'm really happy. I'm
I'm busy as hell. I'm, uh,

38:53.791 --> 38:55.836
I'm recording, and I'm writing, and I'm...

38:55.880 --> 38:58.320
I'm doing press, and I've just taken
a break from the tour for the moment

38:58.338 --> 38:59.990
to keep recording the album.

39:00.021 --> 39:02.574
But I'll be back soon, and my
whole life's just kind of...

39:02.605 --> 39:03.844
perfect.

39:03.913 --> 39:06.453
Give my best to Gunnar. See ya.

39:14.418 --> 39:17.233
Thanks for coming. Well, look who's back.

39:18.046 --> 39:19.485
I don't have a demo.

39:19.535 --> 39:22.144
I don't have any professional experience.

39:22.176 --> 39:25.310
But this is a recording of my church solo.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.075
I can sing.

39:27.369 --> 39:29.508
I can really sing.

39:34.794 --> 39:35.996
Where's aunt Tandy?

39:36.014 --> 39:37.072
Her stuff's gone.

39:37.192 --> 39:39.393
Yeah, um, she left.

39:39.599 --> 39:40.963
Did you guys get in a fight?

39:41.144 --> 39:42.646
Is she coming back?

39:44.704 --> 39:47.174
Uh, come here.

39:48.933 --> 39:50.591
I think your aunt Tandy

39:50.616 --> 39:52.987
and your grandfather and
I are just gonna have to...

39:53.181 --> 39:56.704
Take a little... a little
time apart from each other.

40:04.261 --> 40:05.756
What are you doing here?

40:05.876 --> 40:07.351
Oh, I'm just trying to figure out

40:07.357 --> 40:09.440
why you're so hell-bent on destroying me,

40:09.472 --> 40:11.136
filling Rayna, the feds,

40:11.155 --> 40:13.070
anybody that'll listen to you full of lies.

40:13.101 --> 40:15.528
You got something to say to me, say it.

40:15.566 --> 40:17.618
The most powerful man in Nashville

40:17.738 --> 40:19.908
just assumed that he
was surrounded by people

40:19.946 --> 40:21.554
who would endlessly do his bidding.

40:21.610 --> 40:22.574
You never thought...

40:22.618 --> 40:24.163
- Never thought what, Teddy?!
- Never thought

40:24.213 --> 40:26.272
that the one who betrayed you

40:26.309 --> 40:27.561
was right under your nose!

40:27.611 --> 40:29.520
Is this more lies, Teddy?

40:29.570 --> 40:31.598
I couldn't have brought
you down if I wanted to.

40:31.718 --> 40:33.912
Only someone who stood by you

40:33.956 --> 40:36.121
and worked with you for 15 years

40:36.190 --> 40:38.349
and who knew where the bodies
were buried could do that...

40:38.380 --> 40:40.169
your own flesh and blood.

40:40.588 --> 40:42.484
Not Tandy.

40:42.909 --> 40:43.879
Because of you,

40:43.923 --> 40:46.732
my wife is buried in the
middle of Mount Olivet cemetery,

40:46.757 --> 40:47.658
and so help me God,

40:47.696 --> 40:49.529
I will make sure you pay for that one day.

40:56.593 --> 40:57.544
Lamar?

40:57.594 --> 40:59.183
Help me.

41:06.322 --> 41:07.542
Help me.

41:08.950 --> 41:10.151
Ple...

41:10.202 --> 41:12.754
Teddy, please.
