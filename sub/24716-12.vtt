ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.877 --> 00:04.963
Most of what I do with clients
is show them apartments.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.007
If they like them, they buy.
If they don't, they don't.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.883
I have to believe you’re
a big part of that though.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.469
The way you look, the way you dress.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.056
Speaking personally, uh,
I would put a lot of faith

00:15.140 --> 00:16.850
in what you have to say about things.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.811
At some point, uh,
I may be in the market myself.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.856
-Really?
-If you find something interesting, uh,

00:22.939 --> 00:25.525
-maybe you could show it to me.
-I’d be happy to.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.944
I’m sorry, sir.
Your card has been declined.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.655
Why don’t I put this on my card?

00:40.123 --> 00:43.585
JOHN: Her name’s Faith Chandler,
according to her driver’s license.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.128
Thirty-two years old.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.923
Address listed as Continental Avenue
in Forest Hills.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.925
There’s a condom under the pillow.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.387
Yeah, the apartment’s leased
to this Claudia Weintraub, who called in.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.556
-ANDY: Is that her?
-JOHN: Yeah.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.310
I thought she looked familiar.
She’s a big-time madam.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.728
What else is in there?

01:01.811 --> 01:03.313
JOHN: A parking ticket
with a money order,

01:03.438 --> 01:06.149
probably gonna drop it
in the mailbox when she got a stamp.

01:07.233 --> 01:11.821
We got mints, lipstick, tampons,
aspirin, keys...

01:12.947 --> 01:14.032
this card.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.786
Serenity prayer.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.998
"God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.168
"the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference."

01:25.585 --> 01:28.421
-That’s AA thing, right?
-Yeah.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.382
It doesn’t always work.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.220
Miss Weintraub? Talk to you a sec?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.473
-Yeah, sure.
-You set this up?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.309
Look, even though I know
you have me in your dossiers,

01:41.434 --> 01:42.977
I’m out of that world, completely.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.687
-ANDY: Uh-huh.
-So, why is she in your apartment?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.981
She needed a place to stay.
I said she could use it.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.983
-She was freelancing in other words?
-Right.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.902
-JOHN: Any idea who with?
-Nope.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.821
We’re gonna want to see your book.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.739
I don’t have a book.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.741
Hey, Claudia, who do you think
you’re dealing with, huh?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.451
A disapproving relative?

01:58.576 --> 02:00.829
We’ll lock your ass up.
We’ll go through your apartment.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.123
We’ll find a dozen different
reasons to prosecute.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.582
Now, what’s it gonna be?

02:05.083 --> 02:07.710
I wasn’t lying when I said
I was out of this world.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.840
I met a terrific guy, square as they come.
Knows nothing about any of this,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.675
and I would really love
to keep it that way.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.635
The only way you got any chance of that,

02:15.718 --> 02:18.054
give us who you think
she might have been with.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.099
There was this, uh, one guy
who was crazy about her.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.810
Used to take her on trips, buy her things.
Maybe it was him.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.687
-What’s his name?
-Bob Cavanaugh.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.771
You’ll give us his number.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
You won’t let him know
it was me though, right?

02:28.481 --> 02:31.192
If you got this terrific new guy,
what’s the difference?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.278
You don’t want to lose a customer.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.322
Just in case it doesn’t work out
with my guy.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.900
-Can I help you?
-I’m here to see Detective Medavoy.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.401
-Hey!
-(CHUCKLES)

03:57.487 --> 03:59.656
-Bad time?
-GREG: Uh, not at all.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.325
You had mentioned being
interested in an apartment,

04:02.450 --> 04:04.577
and I found one that I thought
might work for you.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.621
Oh, yeah? Uh...

04:07.080 --> 04:11.459
It’s on Third Avenue and 16th Street.
Lots of light, it’s not huge,

04:11.668 --> 04:13.920
but I figured if it’s just you,
it might work.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.505
-Uh, great
-BRIDGET: It’s a lease

04:15.630 --> 04:18.091
with an option to buy.
I know the seller is motivated,

04:18.216 --> 04:20.093
so I thought the sooner
you saw it, the better.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.178
By "soon," you mean this week, this month?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.848
(LAUGHS) With apartments, Greg,
"soon" means today.

04:25.974 --> 04:29.394
-Oh, then I’ll see it today.
-BRIDGET: Can you come at lunch?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.020
-Yes.
-Right, um...

04:31.980 --> 04:35.275
meet me... in front
of the building, twelve o'clock.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.362

455 Great Jones Street, third floor.

on that block.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.040
Thank God it already closed.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.418
GREG: See ya.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.097
RITA: You own the building, Miss Kunitz?

05:06.389 --> 05:09.100
-Since 1961.
-Did you know Tracy Llewellyn?

05:09.183 --> 05:11.686
Another young person came
to New York to be an artist.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.771
Very nice, very pretty.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.275
Absolutely no idea what it takes
to survive on her own.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.569
-Did she have a job?
-Not that I knew of.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.321
-How’d she pay rent?
-BERTHA: She’d bring it to me

05:21.487 --> 05:24.741
-in cash in an envelope.
-Any idea where she was getting it from?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.701
I knew exactly where
she was getting it from.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.204
At first, she was secretive about it.
We would sit and have tea, though,

05:30.413 --> 05:33.374
and gradually, she couldn’t hold
herself back from letting me know.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.627
That she was seeing
this well-known designer.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.796
Industrial designer... whatever that is.

05:38.921 --> 05:43.426
-Did she tell you his name?
-Hal Matheson. Married, children.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.137
And according to her, everything was fine.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.264
-Thanks for your help, Miss Kunitz.
-Hmm.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.022
So, what’s this about? (SIGHS)

05:56.272 --> 05:58.274
There was an accident
on the Grand Central Parkway.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.526
Someone got a partial plate
that came up

06:00.610 --> 06:01.736
as possibly belonging to you.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.072
I wasn’t anywhere near
the Grand Central Parkway last night.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.366
-Where were you?
-I was at dinner with a friend.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.701
-Yeah, where was that?
-Restaurant called West.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.245
-Who was the friend?
-What’s going on here, guys?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.623
-Just standard questions.
-I don’t think so.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.375
You know someone
named Faith Chandler?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.210
-What happened to her?
-JOHN: What makes you think

06:17.293 --> 06:18.961
-something happened to her?
-BOB: Hey, stop playing

06:19.045 --> 06:21.047

I want to know what happened to her.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.507
She was killed.

with her, Bob?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.889
(SIGHS)

06:29.972 --> 06:32.141
It started out, she was
just a hooker, you know?

06:32.266 --> 06:34.102
"Here’s 1,000 dollars, honey.
Jump rope for me."

06:34.310 --> 06:36.896
That changed, though.
I started to care about her.

06:36.979 --> 06:41.526
I started wanting to have her around me.
I took her to Paris, I took her to Tokyo.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.821
-(SCOFFS) I left my wife.
-She was still just a hooker, though.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.990
You think that put me off her?
I liked her being a hooker.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.785
You liked it and you didn’t like it.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.162
Yeah, maybe the sex got a little rough,
thing got out of control.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.415
Next thing you know,
you got your hands around her throat.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.460
I haven’t seen this girl,
it’ll be... two weeks this Friday.

07:00.294 --> 07:03.965
I know this because I have made
an effort to not call her,

07:04.048 --> 07:05.716
and I’ve been keeping track of it.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.469
Fact is, I could have stopped her
from being a hooker.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.805
I couldn’t stop her
from being an alcoholic.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.857
How can I help you?

07:21.190 --> 07:22.525
We’d like to speak to Hal Matheson.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.194
Hal’s not here.
I’m Paige Matheson, his wife.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.322
-Can you tell us when he’ll be back?
-Can you tell me what it’s about?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.534
RITA: Your husband’s name came up
during a routine investigation.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.995
We just need to ask him
a couple questions.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.746
Are you and your husband partners?

07:36.122 --> 07:39.250
That would be giving myself
entirely too much credit.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.335
I’m just his office manager.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.004
What kind of work
does your husband do?

07:43.171 --> 07:46.257
If you’ve ever used
any of the high-end laptops

07:46.340 --> 07:48.134
or plasma television screens.

07:48.259 --> 07:52.638
Or small personal reading lights
you’ve experienced some of Hal’s designs.

07:52.847 --> 07:57.393
He’s an incredibly gifted visionary
when it comes to the use of materials,

07:57.560 --> 08:00.980
miniaturizations, ergonomics, all of it.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.316
Paige? Hal’s on the phone.

08:03.941 --> 08:04.984
Speak of the devil.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.820
Thank you.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.615
Hi, sweetie. Where are you?

08:10.907 --> 08:13.493
There are two detectives here
to talk to you.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.078
I know it sounds very ominous.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.499
But they seem very nice,
not to mention pretty.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.336
(CHUCKLES)
He’s just leaving his meeting now.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.588
Will you wait for him, or do you
want him to meet you someplace?

08:25.755 --> 08:29.425
If he could meet us at the 15th precinct,
that’d be great. 111 East, Fifth Street.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.470
If you could meet them
at 111 East, Fifth Street?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.972
Yeah, I want to hear all about it.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.974
Bye, sweetie.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.311
-He can be there in half an hour.
-Great.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.688
No flirting.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.113
-Thanks for coming in, Mr. Matheson.
-Sure.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.449
Uh, we wanted to know
where you were last night?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.951
I was at home.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.953
-Which is where?
-Weston, Connecticut.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.956
-RITA: Anyone there with you?
-HAL: My wife, my two kids.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.708
May I ask what it is I’m suspected of?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.794
RITA: Oh, you’re not being suspected
of anything.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.505
Uh, your name came up in the course
of a landlord/tenant dispute.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.048
What kind of landlord/tenant dispute?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.093
Do you know a girl named Tracy Llewellyn?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.470
-Uh-huh.
-When was the last time you saw her?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.931
-Uh, a few days ago.
-What’s your relationship with her?

09:17.014 --> 09:19.892
How is this relevant
to a landlord/tenant dispute?

09:20.059 --> 09:21.644
Are you paying her rent?

09:21.852 --> 09:24.522
-Assume that I am.
-That’s how it’s relevant.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.150
-Are you romantically involved with her?
-I’m not going to answer that.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.945
What kind of dispute
is she having with her landlady?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.364
Tracy Llewellyn was found dead
this morning.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.785
Oh, my God.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.622
We’re looking into any possible motive
someone might have had for killing her.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.750
(SIGHS) Can you help us
with that, Mr. Matheson?

09:44.917 --> 09:49.130
-How could anybody kill her?
-Were you having an affair with her?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.592
-For how long?
-(SIGHS) About a year.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.469
-Does your wife know?
-HAL: No.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.513
-Anyone in your office?
-No.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.391
(SIGHS) Could it have been a robbery?

10:00.975 --> 10:03.144
-Doesn’t look like it.
-(HAL SIGHS)

10:03.227 --> 10:05.688
Whoever killed her was someone
she let into the loft.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.148
I can’t believe it.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.658
(SIGHS)

10:19.285 --> 10:22.830
Obviously, the important thing
is to find out who did this.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.207
But is it... (SIGHS)

10:25.541 --> 10:29.587
...necessary for my wife to find out
about our relationship?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.088

the truth,

10:31.213 --> 10:35.051

on the investigation, no.

There’s a ton of calls made
from a number

-Hey, you got a minute?
-Yeah, what’s up?

11:16.759 --> 11:19.637
Last week, I went to lunch with Bridget.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.432
And I told her I was interested
in buying an apartment in Manhattan.

11:23.974 --> 11:27.436
-She found one she wants to show me.
-Yeah, so what’s wrong with that?

11:27.770 --> 11:30.898
I can’t afford an apartment in Manhattan.
I can’t afford an apartment in Queens.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.651
-(CHUCKLES) What’d you say it for?
-(SIGHS)

11:33.818 --> 11:36.862
I didn’t want to seem like a slob to her.
I like her.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.239
Uh-huh?

11:38.322 --> 11:41.200
(SIGHS) I mean, I think I really like her.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.286
From what I can tell,
she really likes you.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.872
Yeah, only she’s around people with money.

Ah, she knows that’s not you.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.588
She went to the trouble
to find an apartment for me.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.674
She doesn’t know it’s not me.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.261
(SIGHS) Greg...

12:01.512 --> 12:04.265
I think you should trust in the fact
that her interest in you

12:04.390 --> 12:06.642
has nothing to do with what you can buy.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.687
She likes you.
She likes being around you

12:09.895 --> 12:11.355
(SIGHS) To a point.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.525
But she sees
that I was just putting on airs

12:14.608 --> 12:17.903
and that I was a complete and utter fraud,
I don’t think she’s gonna like me so much.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.113
Hey, look at the apartment,

12:19.196 --> 12:21.073
tell her you can’t afford it,
then take her out to lunch.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.618
I can’t even afford to do that.
Not at the places she’s used to eating at.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.206
Trust me. If she likes you, she likes you.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.626
(SIGHS)

12:37.840 --> 12:40.426
Well, looks like Annabelle’s
got the top floor.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.677
Not bad.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.808
Bad boy, Hal.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.228
Not your typical bad boy, though.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.198
-(CAR HORN HONKING)
-LAURA: Mr. Matheson!

13:02.823 --> 13:05.034
-Who was that woman?
-My wife.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.204
Get in the car. Get in.

13:19.340 --> 13:23.010
(SIGHS) See, Hal, the thing
about being untruthful about one thing...

13:23.260 --> 13:24.428
is that it makes us think

13:24.512 --> 13:26.555
that you’re being untruthful
about more than one thing.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.142
I wasn’t being untruthful.
I wasn’t telling you my whole life story,

13:30.226 --> 13:33.062
-but I wasn’t being untruthful.
-Who were those kids?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.855
My son Ethan,
my daughter Miranda.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.733
And your wife, Annabelle, is their mother?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.027
-Yes.
-What about the woman at your office?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.363
That’s my other wife, Paige.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.075
-(CHUCKLES) Any kids with her?
-Three daughters.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.828
Wow, you’re quite an operator.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.123
-I never thought of myself as an operator.
-With two wives and two separate families,

13:53.249 --> 13:55.835
you get a girlfriend and don’t think
you’re an operator?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.586
Annabelle was working for a client.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.464
We spent time together
over the course of the project.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.675
Our relationship became sexual.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.929
There were children, I felt that I had
to provide a stable home,

14:07.096 --> 14:09.640
-so I married her.
-Then Tracy came along.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.643
Tracy was an intern one summer.
She was a student at RSDI.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.895
I told her when she graduated
to get in touch.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.273
Three years later, there she was.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.985
Wonderful draftsman.
Talented girl, talented.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.487
We started spending time together.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.531
That also turned sexual.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.742
It might have been one too many, Hal.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.786
You make time for things
that are important.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.915
Yeah, two wives and a girlfriend?
How does that work?

14:34.999 --> 14:38.127
I leave work with Paige.
We drive to our home in Connecticut.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.880
One daughter’s away at college
but we have dinner with the other two.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.175
I go to bed around 9:30,
wake up at 1:00, go into the city.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.511
Paige assumes that I’m going to work.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.930
Annabelle assumes
that I’m coming home from work.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.765
I get into bed with her.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.728
Wake up at 8:00, have breakfast
with the kids then I go to the office.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.606
Where does that leave Tracy?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.524
Lunches.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.193
We’re gonna need you
to stick around awhile, Hal.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.071
-Why?
-’Cause this is a homicide investigation

15:06.155 --> 15:07.448
and we need you too.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.408
You’re also looking
at being charged with bigamy.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.118
Annabelle and I aren’t legally married.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.204
It was important to her
that we be married,

15:14.371 --> 15:16.206
so we had a ceremony,
but the guy who performed it

15:16.332 --> 15:18.500
was only pretending to be a minister.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.046
Under the circumstances,
it was the best I could do.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.673
So, you’re legally married to Paige.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.592
Annabelle thinks
you’re legally married to her.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.094
Between the two of them,
you have five kids,

15:29.178 --> 15:30.721
and you’re cheating
on both of them with Tracy.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.433
I know. It sounds complicated.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.769
-A little.
-Yeah.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.063
(DOOR BANGING)

15:40.189 --> 15:42.775
What does this guy have?
Some voodoo sexual technique

15:42.900 --> 15:45.486
-that makes all these women fall for him?
-I don't know what he's got...

15:45.569 --> 15:48.364
Hey, crime scene called.
They got tied up in a homicide in the 2-5.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.491
They won’t be able to get
to yours before late afternoon.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.785
-Let’s go back there ourselves.
-Yeah, will you let the boss know?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.244
-Sure.
-RITA: Thanks.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.458
Who do I talk to about Faith Chandler?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.752
I’m Sipowicz. What can I do for you?

16:01.835 --> 16:04.588
There’s something of Faith’s
I think you might want to take a look at.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.465
All right, come on back here.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.307
-How’d you know her?
-I was her AA sponsor.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.935
In Alcoholics Anonymous,
people have a sponsor

16:18.018 --> 16:21.230
to help them get through
the program, the 12 steps.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.401
One of them involves
writing a list of the people you hurt

16:25.484 --> 16:26.902
and how you hurt them.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.948
This is Faith’s list. Maybe it’ll help.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.577
-How much time did she have?
-She got her 30-day chip on Sunday.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.955
Any boyfriends
that, uh, we should know about?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.665
It was a long time
since she had a boyfriend.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.001
But she did start seeing a guy
she met at the meeting,

16:42.084 --> 16:44.628
although she promised me
she would break it off.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.005
Who’s the guy?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.759
I don’t feel I have the right
to violate anyone’s anonymity.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.511
All right, listen to me.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.722
I have eight years.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.433
I take anonymity very seriously.

16:57.599 --> 17:01.687
But this is a homicide investigation,
and anyone this girl was involved with,

17:01.770 --> 17:04.690
we’re gonna find out who they are,
and we’re gonna talk to them.

17:04.815 --> 17:08.068
(SIGHS) There’s a five o'clock meeting
where I see him.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.487
Second floor, McBurney Y.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.907
Had she been drinking?

17:15.409 --> 17:18.328
-What difference does it make?
-If she started drinking or using,

17:18.412 --> 17:20.581
it would have made her
vulnerable to a lot of things.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.375
Yeah, there are some indications
that she had been drinking.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.919
ANDY: There was also
a money order made out

17:26.045 --> 17:28.213
-to pay for a parking ticket.
-Yeah.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.050
-I told her she should pay her debts.
-She was trying.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.595
When I first came in,
I was living in my car.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.513
There was a warrant out for my arrest.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.975
All I wanted to do
was close my eyes and die in my sleep.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.270
(SIGHS) Now I got 18 years of sobriety,

17:43.979 --> 17:46.482
a husband, a kid, an apartment, a job.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.276
-We both have a lot to be grateful for.
-(SIGHS)

17:50.319 --> 17:51.862
The ones who don’t make it...

17:53.572 --> 17:54.782
they break your heart.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.219
It’s him. (SIGHS)

18:15.761 --> 18:17.930
-Still wet.
-RITA: Since he wasn’t spending the night,

18:18.013 --> 18:20.265
she must have known
she was in second position.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.642
Not to mention third.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.269
(SIGHS) She still wasn’t calling it quits.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.356
Call it quits? She was painting
pictures of him.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.400
Maybe it was easier to kill her
than blow her off.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.780
-There’s a message.
-(TELEPHONE BEEPS)

18:34.947 --> 18:36.615

<i>-Thank you.</i>
-(TELEPHONE BEEPING)

18:48.293 --> 18:50.712
If it’s an ob-gyn,
we ought to pay them a visit.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
What can I do for you?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.896
I’m Detective Ortiz.
This is Detective Murphy.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.274
-We're with the New York City Po...
-Let’s see some ID.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.029
You have a patient here
named Tracy Llewellyn.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.657
Last scheduled appointment
was a week ago Monday, 10:00 a.m.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.117
Patient records are confidential.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.077
If you wanna see em',
you’re gonna need a court order.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.247
Tracy Llewellyn was murdered last night.
We can get a court order.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.249
We can close you down
while we comb through your records.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.126
Or you could cooperate
and answer a few questions.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.713
-What’s the other questions?
-Was Tracy Llewellyn pregnant?

19:36.258 --> 19:39.136
-In her first trimester.
-Was she here by herself?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.889
A guy was with her.
Older, nice looking.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.849
-White, black...
-RECEPTIONIST: White.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.101
Kind of grayish hair.
I think he had some kind of beard.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.561
Would you know him
if you saw him again?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.606
Probably. Not too many people
pay in cash.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.899
Thanks for your time.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.401
Something happened with her
you might want to know about.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.820
She and her guy go to meet
with the doctor,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.114
and while they’re back there,
another guy comes in.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.910
Who’s also a detective, so he says.
Shows me a badge.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.746
I go to write down his information,
same as I did with you,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.748
and that’s when he admits
that he’s a private detective.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.750
-What was he here for?
-RECEPTIONIST: He wanted to know

20:10.042 --> 20:11.168
was Tracy Llewellyn pregnant.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.920
Would you have what you wrote down
about him handy?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.213
Yeah.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.551
Name’s Nick Mastriano.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.346
This is the PI license number
on his card.

20:23.096 --> 20:23.972
Thanks.

20:28.435 --> 20:32.022
Crime scene called earlier.
Technician saw the lipstick on your DOA,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.483
said it looked like one
in the ninth precinct.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.069
-What age?
-Mid-30s, white, just like yours.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.905
I called the Ninth squad
and had the case folder sent over here.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.573
Any other common denominators?

20:41.907 --> 20:42.991
High blood alcohol on theirs.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.369
You said there’d been signs
of drinking with yours.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.413
Yours was in AA.
Theirs had just gotten out of rehab.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.791
It’s not a lock it’s a pattern,
but it’s a possibility.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.502
-We take this.
-THOMAS: I’ll check with homicide,

20:53.627 --> 20:56.255
see if there’s any other
open cases we’re looking at.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.133
Where was your husband
last night, Annabelle?

21:00.759 --> 21:02.928
-He was with me.
-The whole night?

21:03.387 --> 21:06.431
He works until very late
most of the time.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.601
-Like, how late?
-ANNABELLE: 1:00, 2:00 in the morning.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.437
He gets his best work done
when it’s quiet. (CHUCKLES)

21:12.562 --> 21:16.275
-So, he got home at what time?
-ANNABELLE: It was a quarter to 3:00.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.152
Can I ask what this is about?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.446
Is the name Tracy Llewellyn familiar
to you?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.532
-No.
-LAURA: We have information

21:23.657 --> 21:26.535
that leads us to believe
your husband had a relationship with her.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.078
What kind of relationship?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.456
-An affair.
-(SCOFFS) I don’t believe that.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.000
He’s admitted to it.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.586
Is she somebody he works with?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.214
At one time, she did, yeah.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.009
-It’s my fault.
-How is it your fault?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.760
If he felt isolated from me,

21:43.885 --> 21:46.430
if I wasn’t giving him the kind
of connectedness that he needs,

21:46.555 --> 21:49.099
he’s... gonna find it somewhere else.

21:49.224 --> 21:53.770
His connectedness
to Tracy led to her getting pregnant.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.609
-When is she due?
-Tracy was killed last night.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.820
And you think Hal killed her?

22:01.945 --> 22:05.324
-It’s a distinct possibility.
-It’s not a possibility.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.992
It’s not even a remote possibility.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.493
What if she was holding him up for money?

22:08.702 --> 22:10.787
It wouldn’t matter.
Hal would get the money.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.539
Well, what if she wanted him
to marry her?

22:12.622 --> 22:15.792
-He would have told her he was married.
-Maybe she wanted him to get a divorce.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.670
You asked me where Hal was last night.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.548
I told you, he was with me.

22:21.923 --> 22:25.052
I know you’re doing
what you have to be doing,

22:25.344 --> 22:29.264
but you don’t know him.
This is not a man, who kills women.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.060
This is a man who loves them.

22:36.855 --> 22:41.777
ALL: God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

22:41.860 --> 22:47.449
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.909
Amen.

22:49.117 --> 22:53.038
Keep coming back. It works if you work it.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.082
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-ANDY: Which one is he?

22:55.415 --> 22:56.750
With the glasses.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.089
Hi.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.802
(NIDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:08.512 --> 23:10.097
-Hey.
-(SNIFFS)

23:10.263 --> 23:13.475
-Paul, is it?
-Yeah. What’s your name?

23:13.558 --> 23:15.560
-I’m Andy.
-Hey, Andy.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.689
-It’s your first time at this meeting?
-ANDY: Yeah, yeah, it is, actually, yeah.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.068
You know a girl named, uh,
Faith, from this meeting?

23:23.193 --> 23:25.862
Faith C.?
Yeah, yeah, Faith C.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.239
When’s the last time you saw her?

23:27.322 --> 23:29.449
I don’t know,
uh, a few days ago, maybe.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.661
I heard you might have been
dating her is why I’m asking,

23:32.828 --> 23:34.871
something of a 13th step,
if you know what I mean.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.707
-That’s a little personal, Andy.
-Were you seeing her?

23:37.874 --> 23:39.751
I don’t think I want to continue
this conversation.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.131
-ANDY: Where were you last night?
-What is this?

23:44.714 --> 23:47.300
Faith C. was in an accident
last night, Paul.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.303
I’m looking to see who might
know something about that.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.475
I went to a six o'clock meeting
on East 55th Street.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.936
And then I went to dinner
with a bunch of us from the meeting,

23:58.186 --> 24:01.314
-and then I went back to my apartment.
-I’ll need names and numbers.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.776
You act like you’re one of us
to gather information?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.404
Yeah, I act like I’m one of you.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.490
These rooms are supposed
to be safe places for people.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.325
You listen to me, asshole.

24:12.909 --> 24:16.246
These rooms saved my life.
I am one of you.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.915
I take it personally
when someone comes in looking

24:19.040 --> 24:22.836
to cut the weak ones from the herd
because it’s easy to score that way.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.255
Am I getting warm at all?

24:25.380 --> 24:29.092
Any idea why I might be talking
to you, Paul?

24:41.813 --> 24:44.274
Apartments don’t come available
in this building all that often,

24:44.399 --> 24:46.234
which is why I thought you should see it.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.946
-It’s nice.
-It’s a great location.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.325
You’re within walking distance
of Union Square, the Village.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.910
You could walk to work.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.039
After all these years
on the long island expressway,

24:59.122 --> 25:01.041
I... I can’t even imagine that.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.001
(CHUCKLES) Imagine it.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.255
The bathroom looks like they redid it.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.799
They did, all new fixtures.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.177
That... that’s a gas stove, right?

25:12.302 --> 25:15.138
It’s a gas stove with a matching
stainless refrigerator.

25:15.263 --> 25:16.681
-The cellar has...
-I'm... I'm... sorry,

25:16.765 --> 25:20.060
let’s stop. I can’t afford this place.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.312
I’m walking around here,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.481
letting you do all this work,
wasting your time,

25:24.648 --> 25:27.317
-and for what? I... I can’t afford it.
-It's okay.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.819
I can’t afford to rent it.
I can’t afford to buy it.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.488
They shouldn’t have let me
on the elevator...

25:31.655 --> 25:34.074
Greg... it’s okay.

25:34.449 --> 25:38.036
You know, I know you’re gonna tell me
that it doesn’t matter,

25:38.119 --> 25:39.538
because that’s the polite thing to say.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.207
But it weighs on me
that I keep coming up short

25:42.290 --> 25:44.251
when it comes to finances.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.131
Well, have you tried to do
anything about that?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.424
(SIGHS)

25:52.092 --> 25:54.094
I took a job as a bouncer in a bar,

25:54.219 --> 25:56.221
which you’re not allowed
to do if you’re a cop.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.349
My boss found out.
It ended up costing me money.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.769
Maybe you should think
about selling real estate.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.565
-Me? Why?
-’Cause you’d be good at it.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.275
You’re crazy.

26:08.692 --> 26:12.153
In my job, you have to get people
to trust you.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.989
You have to empathize with them.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.616
You have to make them feel
like you’re listening to them.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.618
Anything like your job?

26:18.702 --> 26:21.871
-Yeah, when you put it like that...
-Maybe you should try it.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.124
How would I do that?

26:24.541 --> 26:27.961
I’m meeting a couple tonight
to try to close a sale, meet me there.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.756
We’ll pretend we’re a team
and see how you do.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.676
-You serious?
-BRIDGET: Yes, I am.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.470
(SIGHS)

26:39.806 --> 26:42.434
What can you tell us about Tracy Llewellyn
and Hal Matheson, Nick?

26:42.767 --> 26:44.811
I’m a licensed private investigator.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.523
Absent a subpoena, I’m not at liberty
to reveal confidential information.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.735
-You interested in keeping that license?
-Don’t try to intimidate me.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.405
Impersonating a police officer
is enough to pull it.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.240
Who said I was impersonating
a police officer?

26:57.365 --> 26:59.743
Rest assured, someone did,
and if we asked them to,

26:59.826 --> 27:02.329
they’ll swear out
an affidavit to that effect.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.541
I was hired to surveil Hal Matheson
to see if he had a girlfriend.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.502
-Who by?
-Who else? His wife.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.213
-What’s her name?
-Paige Matheson.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.257
What did Paige do when you told her
Tracy was pregnant?

27:14.507 --> 27:16.801
-She didn’t take it too well.
-Which means what?

27:16.926 --> 27:21.222
She offered me 10,000 dollars...
to have Tracy killed.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.893
-(SIGHS) What’d you tell her?
-NICK: That I wasn’t in that business.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.062
I told her however bad it was,

27:27.228 --> 27:29.105
she’d only make her life
and her kids’ life worse,

27:29.189 --> 27:30.607
if she got involved
in something like that.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.943
-How’d she respond?
-She nodded, thanked me, and left.

27:34.110 --> 27:37.489
-I’m afraid to ask...
-(SIGHS) Tracy’s dead.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.617
For what it’s worth...

27:42.118 --> 27:44.037
I thought I talked her out of it.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.916
Anything more match up
in the two cases?

27:48.083 --> 27:52.170
Ours wrote about some guy in her AA group
that she felt bad for having led on.

27:52.253 --> 27:55.632
The one in the ninth squad got in trouble
for doing the same thing in rehab.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.092
There’s a third case.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.261
Female, white, 37 years old,

28:00.387 --> 28:02.806
found strangled in a flophouse
off eighth Avenue.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.474
Similar thing with the lipstick.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.851
She had a medallion that said,
"One day at a time."

28:06.976 --> 28:08.812
-THOMAS: That significant?
-It’s an AA expression.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.022
You sound like you know
what you’re talking about.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.065
I do.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.234
JOHN: The borough gonna put together
a task force?

28:14.317 --> 28:17.278
We’ll use teams, female undercover
with a male backup.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.781
We’ll also set up
video surveillance outside.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.867
If we focus on the Village,
lower east side, and SoHo,

28:22.951 --> 28:25.578
-there’s 35 meetings a day.
-Since I go to meetings anyways,

28:25.662 --> 28:27.914
I might as well be backup on one of them.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.916
If I gotta go on my own time,
that’s all right.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.128
You don’t. I got the borough
to authorize overtime.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.005
-You want to be involved, as well?
-Sure.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.508
I’m briefing the task force
at six o'clock.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.597
You’re back.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.516
We need you to take a ride with us, Paige.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.600
Now?

28:47.684 --> 28:49.436
There’s a couple things we need
to ask you about.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.479
Oh, I can’t leave here
in the middle of the day.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.232
-It’s kind of important.
-This is also important.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.942
We’ll get you back
as soon as we can.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.404
We have a prototype due on one project,
drawings due on another,

28:59.487 --> 29:02.866
and clients are flying in
from Stockholm on Friday.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.076
Paige! We need to do this.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.705
Okay, I’m just gonna get my jacket
and my bag.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.212
Take us through what you did last night.

29:16.504 --> 29:18.590
Hal and I left the city together.

29:19.174 --> 29:22.594
We picked up his car
at the train station in Westport.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.597
We drove home,
had dinner with our daughters,

29:26.055 --> 29:28.767
-and that’s it.
-What about after dinner?

29:28.850 --> 29:31.394
Our daughters went out,
which allowed us to be intimate

29:31.478 --> 29:34.230
since we’ve never subscribed
to having a locked bedroom door.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.149
Hal got up at his usual time
and left for the city.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.276
-What’s his usual time?
-PAIGE: 1:00 a.m.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.195
He does his best work when it’s quiet.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.905
-What time do you get up?
-PAIGE: 7:00.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.365
I got the girls off to school,
and then I drove into the city

29:44.449 --> 29:45.784
and went to work.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.827
Do you know a girl named Tracy Llewellyn?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.831
Sure. She was an intern who worked for us.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.541
Did you think your husband
was having an affair?

29:53.666 --> 29:54.834
Why are you asking me that?

29:55.168 --> 29:58.379
You hired a private detective
named Nick Mastriano.

29:58.546 --> 30:00.423
-Yes, I did.
-What did he tell you?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.926
That Hal had taken Tracy to see a doctor.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.136
-What doctor?
-An obstetrician.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.846
RITA: And what did that tell you?

30:07.013 --> 30:08.389
That she was pregnant.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.725
-That Hal had gotten her pregnant.
-Not necessarily!

30:10.975 --> 30:13.436
Tracy could have asked Hal
to take her to the doctor

30:13.520 --> 30:15.480
simply because that’s who Hal is.

30:15.563 --> 30:19.275
-Paige, we’ve spoken to Nick Mastriano.
-And what did he tell you?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.820
That you offered him 10,000 dollars
to have Tracy killed.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.823
-And he took that seriously?
-I think he did.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.283
All that was, was me being funny.

30:27.367 --> 30:30.453
A feeble attempt, maybe,
but that’s all it was.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.289
You knew your husband
was having an affair, Paige.

30:34.707 --> 30:35.917
Yes, I did.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.796
It must have hurt.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.844
Every night after he’d leave for the city,
I’d cry myself back to sleep.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.054
Did you ever confront him?

30:48.763 --> 30:51.599
It was me who caused it to happen,
why should I confront him?

30:51.683 --> 30:55.228
-How did you cause it to happen?
-PAIGE: I got my priorities mixed up.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.315
I was so wrapped up in the business
that I forgot about being a wife.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.570
I forgot that at home,
he didn’t need an efficient manager.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.240
At home, he needed the allure of a woman.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.077
The softness, the pliancy.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.912
That’s what he wasn’t getting.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.875
-Did you blame Tracy at all?
-Tracy was around Hal.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.920
And she responded to him
the way that any woman would.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.840
She was around the two of us.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.176
She saw the way that he looked at me.

31:28.177 --> 31:31.306
She sensed the passion
that we had for each other.

31:31.472 --> 31:34.350
We didn’t leave it
in the bedroom when we went to work.

31:35.059 --> 31:39.105
It surrounded us, came off us
like a mist off a pond.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.524
She saw it.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.359
She wanted it.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.196
-Who could blame her?
-(DOOR KNOCKING)

31:47.655 --> 31:49.866
Hey, can I talk to you guys a second?

31:59.834 --> 32:02.045
Hey, we got the E-ZPass records
on this wife’s car.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.963
-And?
-She went over the Triborough Bridge

32:04.088 --> 32:06.215
into the city at 3:15 in the morning.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.690
LAURA: You know that E-ZPass
you keep on the windshield of your car?

32:22.815 --> 32:24.400
-Yeah.
-LAURA: It creates a record

32:24.567 --> 32:27.111
of the date, time, and location
for every toll it’s used for.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.821
-So what are you saying?
-RITA: We're saying

32:28.905 --> 32:31.157
you went to the city last night
at a quarter after 3:00.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.284
I was going to check up on him.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.078
So if we check with the night man
at that building,

32:35.161 --> 32:38.289
-he’ll confirm you showed up there?
-I changed my mind.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.500
He doesn’t deserve the kind of wife,

32:40.583 --> 32:43.544
-who spies on him over a little affair.
-RITA: Paige.

32:44.295 --> 32:48.549
-Affairs happen. They happen all the time.
-Your husband has another wife, Paige.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.635
That’s ridiculous.

32:53.554 --> 32:57.558
He has a wife, named Annabelle.
Who he has two children with.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.186
When he leaves you in Connecticut
at one o'clock the morning,

33:00.269 --> 33:01.312
he goes to her.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.691
I’m aware of the fact
that you use deception

33:04.816 --> 33:06.442
to get people to tell you things.

33:06.567 --> 33:10.196
We saw him with them.
We questioned him, he admitted it.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.619
I must look pretty pathetic
right about now.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.871
You look like a woman
who’s been deceived.

33:19.747 --> 33:22.709
Tell us what happened
when you went to see Tracy.

33:22.792 --> 33:27.046
I thought I could convince her
not to have the child.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.258
She was young.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.760
She would have
other opportunities with other men.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.264
She could have a child
with a father who was available,

33:36.347 --> 33:40.268
who wasn’t taken.
But she didn’t want that!

33:40.351 --> 33:42.770
She wanted this child. She wanted Hal.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.775
-Was there a struggle?
-No.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.951
Get yourself a good lawyer, Paige.

33:58.494 --> 34:01.247
Maybe they can make a case
for temporary insanity.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.964
ANNABELLE: When could I see my husband?

-Yes, he is.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.260

-Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

(PANTING)

34:30.318 --> 34:32.403
Could you lock me up now, please?

34:33.488 --> 34:35.615
(CLEARS THROAT) What was that about?

34:36.324 --> 34:39.118
(SIGHS) There’s some things you need
to know, Annabelle.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.205
It’s probably best
you hear them from us.

34:42.997 --> 34:45.083
Please don’t tell me Hal’s being arrested.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.543
Hal’s not being arrested.
he’s being released.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.253
Oh, thank God.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.800
Hal has another wife, Annabelle,
another wife and three other children.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.180
-This is in addition to Tracy?
-Yeah.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.892
LAURA: His other wife is the woman
who just went after you outside.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.227
She killed Tracy.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.191
(SIGHS) What’s gonna happen
to the three children?

35:10.274 --> 35:12.235
They’re gonna be without their mother.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.824
(SIGHS) You should also know
that you’re not legally married.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.328
Of course we are. We had a wedding.

35:22.787 --> 35:26.290
Hal fooled you. The ceremony was a sham.

35:30.711 --> 35:33.840
If you want to take a minute
and get yourself together,

35:33.965 --> 35:35.591
we’ll tell Hal you couldn’t wait.

35:49.438 --> 35:51.983
-Have you found out who murdered Tracy?
-RITA: Yeah, Hal.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.026
We found out that Paige killed her.

35:55.069 --> 35:58.322
-It just keeps getting worse.
-Kind of a volatile mix.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.992
A pregnant girlfriend
and two devoted wives.

-Yeah, she knows.

How long did you think
you could keep all this going?

36:07.540 --> 36:11.210
They were all so happy.
I just never wanted it to end.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.504
-It’s ended now.
-Is Annabelle here?

36:13.588 --> 36:14.797
She had to leave, Hal.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.508
-She had to get back to your kids.

I need to tell you.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.064
(SHUSHES)

36:35.818 --> 36:37.069
It’s all right.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.244
Come on.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.221
-I love the area.
-Gramercy is great.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.973
I worry about the hooker trade
over on Lexington.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.769
-Well, that’s been pretty much cleaned up.
-I don’t think so.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.647
Although to be sure, I have a friend
who’s a detective I can ask.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.566
-It’s a great building.
-BRIDGET: It’s a Candela building.

37:15.858 --> 37:19.320
Which means the 12-foot ceilings,
the crown moldings, the gallery.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.489
-It feels old.
-It is old.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.574
I told you Norman wouldn’t go for it.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.077
-Hallie, I’m not ruling it out.
-It’s okay.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.789
I’m just gonna take one
last look at the master bedroom,

37:29.914 --> 37:31.207
then we’ll go.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.421
Now I’m the bad guy, right?

37:38.631 --> 37:41.676
Mr. Reese, I’ve only just met you,

37:41.759 --> 37:44.845
so I won’t presume to tell you
what you should do here,

37:45.012 --> 37:49.183
but, uh...
one thing I’ve found in my life,

37:49.642 --> 37:52.478
is that vis-à-vis,
the person I live with...

37:53.479 --> 37:56.607
-if they’re not happy, I’m not happy.
-Well, that does go both ways.

37:56.732 --> 37:59.402
Well, when it comes to things
like where you live

37:59.485 --> 38:01.904
and what the place looks like,

38:02.071 --> 38:05.700
my experience
is that making a woman happy,

38:05.950 --> 38:07.868
when I’ve been able to do that...
(CHUCKLES)

38:08.995 --> 38:11.247
...that’s something I’ve never regretted.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.750
Let’s go.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.757
We’ll take it.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.302
-You don’t have to do that.
-I know I don’t.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.887
-I want it.
-Really?

38:27.096 --> 38:29.056
Tell the seller that we’ll write up
an offer and have it

38:29.140 --> 38:31.100
-over to them by noon tomorrow.
-HALLIE: (SIGHING) Oh.

38:32.184 --> 38:34.478
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

-Oh.
-Thank you.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.943

38:41.777 --> 38:45.448
You just made yourself
in the neighborhood of 17,000 dollars.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.241
-Get out of here.
-BRIDGET: Two and a half percent

38:47.325 --> 38:50.369
of the sale price,
less overhead, split 50/50.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.788
Nah, I’m not gonna take money
out of your pocket

38:52.872 --> 38:54.915
-just 'cause I happened to show up.
-You closed the deal.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.460
-It was your deal.
-You’re taking that money.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.003
No, I’m not.

38:59.086 --> 39:02.131
Now... now, this was fun,
but it was a fluke.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.925
I mean, if I started doing this
for real, it would be different.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.677
What about doing it for real?

39:06.761 --> 39:08.971
-I don’t know, Bridget...
-Maybe we should just

39:09.055 --> 39:10.765
have a drink and talk about that.

39:11.766 --> 39:12.767
Yeah.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.644
Meantime, see if you can’t close
another deal.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.402
We’re going to be
putting you into a rotation

39:23.486 --> 39:25.488
of AA meetings in lower Manhattan.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.866
The object is to draw a guy out
and have him approach one of you

39:29.033 --> 39:30.868
the same way he approached his victims.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.078
From what I understand,

39:32.161 --> 39:34.330
that means raising your hand
and asking to speak.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.332
Detective Sipowicz
has some suggestions

39:36.457 --> 39:38.042
as to what you might say.

39:39.502 --> 39:43.214
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, the chances are
that we’re dealing with somebody who, uh,

39:43.297 --> 39:45.132
for whatever reason,
is turned on by weakness.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.635
We’re guessing
that he approaches his victims

39:47.718 --> 39:50.096
after a meeting,
invites them out for coffee,

39:50.179 --> 39:52.807
and then finds a way
of enticing them to drink.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.643
Once he gets them loaded,
he kills them.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.853
Clearly, the victim has to seem vulnerable
to being enticed.

39:57.978 --> 40:01.399
That means describing incidents
in the past where you were out of control,

40:01.482 --> 40:03.192
or maybe you did something
you're ashamed of

40:03.359 --> 40:04.527
’cause you couldn’t help yourself.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.779
How much detail are we expected
to provide?

40:06.862 --> 40:09.073
-(ALL CHUCKLE)
-As much as you’re comfortable with.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.076
So what we say in there,
we’re making it up, right?

40:12.159 --> 40:15.413
-THOMAS: Entirely up to you.
-The main thing is you make it sound real.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.039

-Good luck.

I’ve been having
a pretty tough time of it.

40:52.783 --> 40:56.787
I know there’s a million reasons
why as bad as I feel now.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.666
Drinking or using
is only gonna make it worse.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.127
I know that in my head, but, uh...

41:04.795 --> 41:06.422
I don’t know it in my heart.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.717
All I know is in my heart, I’m hurting.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.636
There’s a guy I fell in love with...

41:13.679 --> 41:16.182
married, five kids.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.728
He loved his wife. He loved his kids.

41:21.770 --> 41:25.024
And I got him to do
what I wanted him to do.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.359
I got him to be with me.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.361
And now I’m by myself...

41:30.321 --> 41:31.989
and I’m ashamed of myself.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.409
And I’m thinking,
"Who cares if Laura has 30 days?

41:36.952 --> 41:38.454
"Who cares what Laura has?"

RITA: <i>There’s this guy</i>
<i>who’s unavailable to me,</i>

41:43.542 --> 41:45.920
and it dredged up
all the feelings of rejection

41:46.003 --> 41:47.630
that I lived with my whole life.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.174
The father who leaves his kids...

41:51.133 --> 41:53.052
the mother who’s there but isn’t there.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.639
And all I thought was
how much I wanted a drink.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.768
(SIGHS) I’m coming up on 30 days...

42:01.310 --> 42:03.270
and I don’t know if I’m gonna make it.

(SIGHS) If the world looked scary
when I was drinking...

42:09.193 --> 42:11.320
it looks a thousand times scarier now.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.950
(SIGHS) It might be too scary for me
to keep going like this.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.034
I mean...

42:19.036 --> 42:21.080
not everybody gets sober, right?

42:21.830 --> 42:23.624
Not everybody makes it.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.963
The way I’ve been thinking
the last few days...

42:31.340 --> 42:33.509
I might be one of the ones who don’t.
