18:35.200 --> 18:37.400

- Puppies.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.333
- Something's strange here.

18:39.367 --> 18:44.166
Why is everyone staring at me
talking about this dog?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.233
- Mommy, lookit.
- I know.

18:46.266 --> 18:47.533

groomed?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.667

from our foundation,

in a shelter.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.200
It's handled.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.700
So then
the shelter alerted us,

19:12.734 --> 19:15.700
because we have microchips
in all our dogs,

19:15.734 --> 19:18.667

of our dogs down there.

find Lucy another place."

- Well, she wasn't mad at me.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.300
I think that she
was just concerned.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.567
- A little shocked?
- Yeah. A little--as I was.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.700
