01:18.679 --> 01:19.644
morning, skipper.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.612
Morning, gilligan.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.513
Can I help, sir?

01:21.582 --> 01:22.280
Sure you can.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.815
What do you
want me to do?

01:23.884 --> 01:25.317
I know.
Sit down and shut up.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.585
What?

01:26.654 --> 01:28.186
That's what you always say
if I ask if I can help.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.121
I do? Sit down
and shut up?

01:30.190 --> 01:31.623
Uh-huh.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.225
Well, why should i
say a thing like that?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.693
I guess because you think
I'll goof something up.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.962
Well, of course you'll
goof something up,

01:37.031 --> 01:38.963
but that's still
no way to talk
to my little buddy.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.366
No, it isn't.
As a matter of fact,
I'm getting tired of it,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.134
and someday, I'm liable
just to jump ship,

01:43.203 --> 01:45.002
if we ever
get on a ship again.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.606
Gilligan,
you're absolutely right,
and I'm sorry.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.309
But you know how I am.
I spout things off
without even thinking.

01:50.377 --> 01:53.444
But I promise I'll keep
a check on myself
from now on, okay?

01:53.513 --> 01:54.713
Okay.
Still shipmates?

01:54.781 --> 01:56.381
Yes, sir.
Good.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.183
Well, I'll get
this breakfast ready
for the folks.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.251
Skipper, can I help?

01:59.319 --> 02:00.384
Sure you can,
gilligan.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.319
What do you
want me to do?

02:01.387 --> 02:02.687
Sit down and shut up.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.189
Mr. howell: Hello.
Good morning there.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.257
Good morning, gilligan.
Good morning, captain.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.960
What's on the menu
for breakfast this morning?

02:08.027 --> 02:09.560
Fruit
and powdered eggs.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.462
Wonderful.
We'll have some
powered eggs Benedict.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.031
Skipper,
it's starting to rain.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.833
Rain? Don't be silly,
gilligan.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.834
I just felt
a raindrop on my nose.
Small wet.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.104
Oh, that just means that
you're feeling good.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.640
Oh, thurston,
that only applies to dogs.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.174
Oh, you're so right.
I'm sorry, boy.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.343
My, his coat is wet.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.378
I felt
a drop of rain, too.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.780
Yes, you're so right,
lovey.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.582
Maybe we ought to find
a cave or something.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.584
Relax, folks.
This is just
a summer sprinkle.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.453
Believe me,
when a real storm
sets in, you'll feel it.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.155
This isn't
a real storm, huh?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.723
No-o-o-o.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.026
When do you think
the real big storms
are going to start?

02:41.095 --> 02:43.094
Gilligan,
this is just a guess,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.430
but I'd say
the real big storms
will start

02:45.499 --> 02:47.666
in about 30 seconds ago.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.845
Folks, today we had
a little touch of bad weather.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.648
At this time,
I'd like to say thanks
to Mr. and Mrs. howell

03:03.717 --> 03:05.817
for lending us these clothes
while ours are drying out.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.319
Hear, hear.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.287
Glad that we could be
of any help, skipper.
Any time.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.688
I hope it doesn't
start to rain

03:10.757 --> 03:12.357
while I'm wearing
your beautiful coat.

03:12.425 --> 03:13.658
Don't you worry,
dear.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.761
That's one of those
new drip-dry foxes.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.797
Skipper, these clothes
are still wet.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.732
Don't bother me
with those details,
gilligan.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.100
Go over to the fire
and dry them out.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.469
Aye, aye, sir.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.070
Now, folks, I think
one of the first things

03:26.139 --> 03:27.739
that we must agree upon

03:27.808 --> 03:30.241
is a permanent building
in which we will live,
right?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.777
I think
that's a good idea.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.545
Skipper, what am I going to hang
these clothes on to dry?

03:34.614 --> 03:36.315
Don't bother me
about that.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.816
Use your head
for once.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.487
Now, I've drawn up
a little plan...

03:42.555 --> 03:44.256
Of an idea that I have

03:44.325 --> 03:46.158
that I think will be
exactly what we need.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.993
Well, I think
it's very nice, captain,

03:48.062 --> 03:50.428
but I'd like to see
some of the other models
before we decide.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.930
Yes. I like
this one here.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.598
It seems to have
a functional floor plan,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.701
and green
is my favorite color.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.702
Mr. howell, that is
a map of Australia.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.004
Oh. Do you happen to know
how much they're asking
for it?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.440
I mean, I hate kangaroos.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.776
Now, folks, I have
only drawn one plan,

04:04.844 --> 04:07.245
so if any of you
have any suggestions,
I'd like to hear them.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.680
I like it
just fine, skipper.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.982
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.953
What are you doing
with ginger's dress on?

04:15.022 --> 04:16.754
Well, uh...

04:16.822 --> 04:18.690
I couldn't think
of any other way
to dry it, skipper.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.692
That's
using your head
for once.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.363
Now, what do you folks
think of my plan?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.498
Sounds okay to me.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.932
I think it's fine.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.068
Could you build my place
down by the beach?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.870
I think we'd be
more comfortable
up in the hills.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.274
I love the beach,
but weekends,
<i> everybody</i> drops in.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.778
Yes. Something--hillside hut
looking down on the others.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.313
Here you are, skipper,
nice and dry.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.981
Don't give it me.
Give it to ginger.

04:43.049 --> 04:43.982
Oh, here.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.550
Hope you didn't
stretch it.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.052
No. And, Mary Ann,
yours'll be dry
in a minute.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.955
Now, folks,
i want to get
one thing straight--

04:50.024 --> 04:52.423
we are not building
individual huts.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.460
The fact is, we'll have
one permanent building
until we are rescued!

04:55.528 --> 04:57.895
You mean all 7 of us
are going to live
in one hut?

04:57.964 --> 05:00.232
It'll be a lot quicker
and a lot easier

05:00.301 --> 05:01.666
if we all pitch in
and work together.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.135
Remember the old saying--
"united we stand."

05:04.204 --> 05:06.872
In a hut like that,
that's the way
we'll sleep, too.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.607
Well, I'll go along
with the skipper.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.409
If that rain this morning
was any indication,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.178
we're in for
an early storm season.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.513
That's right,
and that storm might hit
any moment now,

05:15.582 --> 05:16.848
so we better
get to work right away.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.417
Well, I guess
the skipper's right, dear.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.318
We can build our house
any time.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.853
Yes, but not like that one.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.621
I see sort of
a Southern colonial mansion

05:23.690 --> 05:24.855
with the big wide
verandas,

05:24.924 --> 05:26.624
sort of a bamboo column,
you know,

05:26.693 --> 05:28.727
and we can plant
the whole thing
with mint.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.662
That's lovely. I always
wanted a plantation.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.931
Yes, miss Scarlett.
Absolutely.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.699
Thanks for
backing me up,
professor.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.202
It was the only
practical solution
at the moment, skipper.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.871
We'll do everything
we can to help,
skipper.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.873
Well, I really don't know
what you ladies can do.

05:41.941 --> 05:44.743
Oh, anything.
I used to be a girl scout,
and they teach you a lot.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.378
I used to go with
a boy scout,

05:46.446 --> 05:48.046
and they teach you
a lot, too.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.415
Here you are, Mary Ann.
Real nice and dry.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.250
Oh, thanks, gilligan.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.318
Bye, girls.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.187
Thanks a lot, gilligan.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.755
Well, are my clothes
dry yet?

05:57.824 --> 06:00.225
A little too dry,
skipper. See.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.927
Oh, gilligan...

06:03.297 --> 06:05.630
[Thundering]

06:11.738 --> 06:13.605
Announcer: Gathering clouds
are clear indication

06:13.674 --> 06:15.974
that a tropical storm
of considerable fury

06:16.043 --> 06:17.776
may be expected shortly.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.477
Coast guard warnings
have been issued

06:19.546 --> 06:21.880
to small craft in the area.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.982
And the coast guard
officially announced today

06:24.050 --> 06:26.084
that it has given up the search
for the 7 persons

06:26.153 --> 06:28.653
aboard the s.S.<i> Minnow,</i>
a small excursion boat

06:28.722 --> 06:30.455
which left Honolulu harbor
last week

06:30.524 --> 06:32.823
on a 3-hour
sightseeing cruise.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.526
In addition
to first mate gilligan

06:34.594 --> 06:35.660
and his skipper
Jonas grumby,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.495
the passenger list
included--

06:37.564 --> 06:39.797
multimillionaire
thurston howell III
and his socialite wife...

06:39.866 --> 06:41.466
Hi, professor. Do you
want a drink of water?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.834
No, thanks,
gilligan.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.436
Oh. Hi, Mr. howell.
Want a drink of water?

06:45.505 --> 06:47.071
No, thank you,
gilligan.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.340
What's that stuff?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.708
Oh. Well, it's for
weatherstripping the hut.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.910
It's a concoction
the professor dreamed up.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.979
Oh, yeah?
Hey, professor.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.747
You know,
you're really great.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.517
I got to take these
in to the skipper.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.920
Whoops. Whoops.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.459
Gilligan, will you watch
what you're doing?

07:08.528 --> 07:10.094
We've got to have
this hut finished
by tonight.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.996
There's a storm brewing
out there someplace.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.031
Ohh...

07:13.099 --> 07:15.800
D'oh. Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.702
This is the only
dry shirt I had left.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.437
I'm sorry, skipper.
Are we gonna
move in here tonight?

07:19.506 --> 07:22.073
That's what the plan is.
We'll have to work
until we drop.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.475
Now get that water
in the barrel.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.742
Aye, aye, sir.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.478
Oop.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.512
Gilligan, will you
put that water in there

07:28.581 --> 07:31.049
while I get some more
palm fronds?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.141
Watch it.
You'll get water
in my punch.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.245
Uh-oh.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.649
Whoo. That was
a close one.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.683
Somebody could've
stepped right...

08:05.752 --> 08:07.886
Into the...Barrel?

08:09.789 --> 08:11.489
Thanks to you,
gilligan,

08:11.558 --> 08:13.291
somebody
already has.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.759
I'm sorry, skipper.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.827
You shouldn't stand on this.
It's too dangerous.

08:15.895 --> 08:16.628
I'll go get you a ladder.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.963
Never mind!

08:18.031 --> 08:20.098
It's okay.
It's right over there
by the door.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.134
That's a real good job,
Mr. howell.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.236
Thank you.
Thank you.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.271
Professor: Aah!

08:26.340 --> 08:27.271
[Thud]

08:27.340 --> 08:28.974
What was that?

08:30.977 --> 08:33.376
Professor,
did you hear something
out here?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.445
What?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.047
Oh, you're
taking a nap, huh?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.182
That's okay,
'cause the skipper'll
drive you till you drop.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.985
Go back to sleep.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.254
[Thwack]

08:43.323 --> 08:44.389
Oops.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.891
Uh-oh.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.963
I'm sorry,
Mr. howell.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.400
I really am,
Mr. howell. I...

08:55.468 --> 08:56.400
I guess I just
wasn't looking.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.936
Yes.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.742
Probably
the stupidest thing

09:03.810 --> 09:06.043
I ever did
in my whole...

09:06.112 --> 09:07.878
Entire...Life.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.514
Aah!

09:09.583 --> 09:12.017
You want to bet on that,
gilligan?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.552
Gill--

09:14.621 --> 09:16.755
gilligan, you...

09:25.265 --> 09:27.665
I still can't believe
the place is really finished.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.966
Gilligan,
it's been a long day.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.435
Why don't you
hit the sack?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.303
Yes, sir.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.972
Oof.

09:58.064 --> 10:01.632
Gilligan, why don't you try
jumping into the upper sack?

10:01.701 --> 10:03.001
Good thinking, skipper.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.103
Unh!

10:09.008 --> 10:12.109
Gilligan, why don't you
get in the lower sack,

10:12.178 --> 10:13.745
and I will
get in the upper.

10:13.813 --> 10:14.879
I hate to kick you
out of your own bed.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.047
There's just
not enough room

10:16.115 --> 10:18.016
for us both
in the lower sack.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.754
Well, don't stand there.
Help me up.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.304
[Snoring]

11:13.373 --> 11:16.007
Ohh. Skip-per.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.078
Mr. howell:
You can have the bedroom
all to yourself.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.814
I'll sleep out here
tonight.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.515
Mrs. howell: Sleep out there
tomorrow night, too.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.250
What was that, gilligan?

11:26.319 --> 11:29.020
Mr. howell: I wonder
if I might trouble you
for my pillow.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.055
Mrs. howell: Not at all.
Here's your pillow,

11:31.124 --> 11:34.959
and here's your blanket,
and here's your Teddy bear.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.527
[Gasps]

11:36.596 --> 11:37.729
Teddy bear?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.799
Teddy bear.
Get up, please.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.871
What is going on
in here?

11:47.940 --> 11:49.574
Never mind.
It's a private matter.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.243
It is not, and I want to know
what the captain has to say
about it

11:52.312 --> 11:54.478
and what gilligan
has to say about it
and what--

11:54.547 --> 11:56.647
when you get around to me,
I'd like to say pipe down
and get to sleep.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.882
Nobody asked
for your opinion.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.150
Will you folks
keep it quiet?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.651
People are trying
to sleep in here.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.754
You're no help, shouting
at the top of your lungs.

12:02.822 --> 12:03.888
I'm not shouting
at the top of my lungs!

12:03.957 --> 12:05.323
I'm trying
to get some quiet.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.358
If you want to keep quiet,
start with my wife.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.426
She began the whole thing.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.593
I began it?!

12:09.662 --> 12:10.595
Yes, you did.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.796
Listen, folks,
why don't we--

12:11.865 --> 12:13.264
oh, shut up,
will you, gilligan?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.932
You can't tell gilligan
to shut up.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.033
<i> I'll</i> tell him
when to shut up.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.335
Thanks, skipper.
Now, folks--

12:17.404 --> 12:18.336
shut up, gilligan!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.738
Are you two arguing
every night?

12:20.806 --> 12:21.939
And what is that
to you?

12:22.008 --> 12:23.408
Well, I happen
to live here.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.009
So do we,
I'm sorry to say.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.844
This was a stupid idea
from the very start.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.613
Tomorrow, lovey and i--
we're gonna build
our own little hut.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.782
Remember
what the skipper said?

12:30.850 --> 12:31.983
There's a big storm
on the way.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.184
And what does
he know about it?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.685
Has anyone
seen the sky?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.253
It's as clear as a bell.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.555
I think we've gone
to a lot of work
for nothing.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.489
So do I.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.824
Now, wait a minute.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.192
Don't be fooled by
a little good weather.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.293
We're gonna have
a real blow, alright.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.894
What do you know
about it?

12:43.963 --> 12:45.896
It just so happens
I'm an experienced sailor.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.498
If you were
an experienced sailor,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.133
we wouldn't be shipwrecked
on this <i> dreary</i> island.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.068
Oh, darling, let's spend
the rest of the night outside.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.836
I'm getting
a touch of hut fever.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.806
I'll take you
out in the jungle
where it's nice and quiet.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.909
I think
I'll start to work
on my own place, too.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.778
Oh, that's a good idea.
Good idea.

13:00.847 --> 13:01.612
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.380
Now be practical.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.483
What do you folks think
you're going to use
to make huts?

13:05.551 --> 13:07.952
First of all, we'll
start with our door.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.120
Yes, our door.
Our little door.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.122
And these walls
belong to us.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.523
We'll take our walls.
Come on.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.426
I'll be by in the morning
for my roof, too.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.329
I think they're making
a big mistake.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.932
They sure are.
Part of the roof
belongs to Mr. howell.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.367
I mean their attitude.
They're all acting
for themselves.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.902
We've got to function
as a group.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.603
You're right, skipper.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.973
Wonder what's going to happen
when those monsoons come.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.541
I don't know.
Maybe they'll build
their own huts.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.811
If they don't,
they have to come
bunk with us.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.480
Oh, oh. I...

13:35.549 --> 13:36.981
Thought everyone
was asleep.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.849
We're turning in
right now, Mr. howell.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.651
Well, I thought
I'd forgotten something,

13:40.720 --> 13:42.019
but I guess
i was mistaken.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.322
No, you weren't,
Mr. howell.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.557
Here it is.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.262
Na-na.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.836
[Thunder]

14:12.585 --> 14:13.918
Skipper: Gilligan!

14:13.987 --> 14:16.187
I'm right here
in the kitchen.
Or is it the den?

14:16.255 --> 14:17.321
I don't know
exactly where I am,

14:17.390 --> 14:19.123
but I know I'm
right here someplace.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.691
Gilligan,
you are standing
in my bedroom.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.427
I'm sorry, skipper.
You want to come in
and go to sleep?

14:22.495 --> 14:23.794
No, I don't
want to come in
and go to sleep.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.028
It's alright
if you want to,

14:25.097 --> 14:26.130
because I can go work
in the living room,

14:26.199 --> 14:27.031
if I can remember
where I put it.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.299
I want you to come out

14:28.368 --> 14:30.435
and plane the ends
of this crossbeam.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.576
Gilligan,
what are you doing?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.144
Trying to find
the front door.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.447
Will you get out here and start
working on this beam?

14:43.516 --> 14:45.450
Skipper, how come this place
is taking so long?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.485
Everybody else
is almost done
with their huts.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.521
Gilligan,
my father had 2 sayings
i shall always remember--

14:50.590 --> 14:52.189
"hurried work
is worried work,"

14:52.258 --> 14:54.791
and "a job not well done
is not a well-done job."

14:54.860 --> 14:56.160
Skipper,
that's beautiful.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.762
Pop used to say a lot
of beautiful things.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.763
Was he a poet?

14:58.831 --> 15:00.865
Not exactly, gilligan.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.733
Well, pop was
kind of a world tra--

15:02.802 --> 15:03.934
oh, never mind,
gilligan.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.269
Now start
working on this beam.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.371
I'll get
some more bamboo.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.939
Yes, sir.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.877
Ha ha.
Hello there, gilligan.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.412
Hi, Mr. howell.
How are things going?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.648
I'm happy to announce
the completion of howell manor,

15:16.716 --> 15:18.982
and I just stopped by
to ask you and the skipper

15:19.051 --> 15:21.986
for a little
plantation warming
tonight.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.287
Is it okay if I wear
what I have on?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.389
Oh, yes. Yes.
Delightfully informal.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.090
I think you'll know
everybody there.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.460
Yeah, I guess I will
at that, huh?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.328
Oh, by the way,
might I borrow
this machete?

15:31.397 --> 15:33.230
You see, I want to cut
some palm leaves.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.866
Mrs. howell's
making some drapes
for the dining room.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.034
Sure, Mr. howell.

15:37.102 --> 15:37.969
What time
should we be there?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.436
Shall we say 5-ish?

15:39.505 --> 15:41.038
I think you know
where the place is.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.206
Yes, sir. Right behind
that rock over there.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.808
Yeah,
that's the place.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.811
Ta-ta, my boy.
See you then.
Ha ha.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.281
[Sings gibberish]

15:55.488 --> 15:57.588
Why aren't you
working on the beam?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.291
Because I gave the machete
to Mr. howell.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.693
Gilligan, did it
ever occur to you
to use the saw?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.595
Yes, sir.
That's the first thing
i thought of.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.430
Well, why didn't you
use the saw?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.032
Because I loaned that
to the professor.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.266
How are we ever going
to get this place done

16:09.335 --> 16:10.934
if you keep
loaning our tools out?

16:11.003 --> 16:12.770
I don't want you
to do that anymore.
That's an order.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.538
Yes, sir.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.507
Gilligan,
anybody that comes up
and says anything to you,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.510
wants anything, the answer
is no, no, no, no, no.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.047
Now, have you got that?
No! I mean, yes.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.582
Gilligan...

16:33.460 --> 16:34.392
Hello.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.493
No, no, n-o, no!

16:35.562 --> 16:36.560
Gilligan...

16:36.629 --> 16:39.130
What kind of a greeting
is that?

16:39.198 --> 16:40.998
That's the kind of greeting
everybody gets who tries
to borrow anything--

16:41.067 --> 16:42.833
no, no, no!

16:42.902 --> 16:46.103
Well, I didn't come here
to borrow anything.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.505
You didn't?

16:47.573 --> 16:48.940
No.
No?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.507
No.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.542
Oh.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.746
All I want
is just a...

16:55.815 --> 16:58.816
A teeny-weeny,

16:58.885 --> 17:02.853
weensy,
weeny piece of rope.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.823
How long a little
teeny-weeny,

17:05.892 --> 17:08.358
eensy-weensy bit of rope
do you want?

17:08.426 --> 17:09.992
9 feet.

17:10.061 --> 17:12.863
That isn't much,
is it?

17:12.932 --> 17:13.997
Well...

17:14.066 --> 17:16.768
No. 9 feet's hardly
anything at all.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.773
This is
awfully sweet of you,
gilligan.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.442
Oh, heck, it's only rope.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.743
Let's see now...
6 feet...

17:27.813 --> 17:29.780
And 3 feet more...

17:29.848 --> 17:32.383
Makes 9 feet. Yeah.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.418
Okay.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.788
Here's your 9 feet of rope,
ginger. Yeah.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.156
Thank you, gilligan.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.759
And if you, um, if you need
a low ceiling,

17:41.827 --> 17:44.261
I got two 3-foot beams,
if you want 'em.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.029
The rope is all I wanted.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.598
Thanks.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.501
Skipper: Gilligan!

17:53.739 --> 17:55.773
I made a mistake
with the 6-foot beam.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.241
Yeah? Oh, that's okay,
skipper.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.476
Everybody makes mistakes,
especially with 6-foot beams.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.677
I think 6-foot beams
are the easiest--

17:59.746 --> 18:01.545
gilligan, will you
cut that out?

18:01.614 --> 18:04.082
I want to use this
for a wall brace.
Cut it in half.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.955
Here you are, skipper.
Two 3-foot crossbeams.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.423
You sure did that
in a hurry.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.091
Yes, sir.
Hand me that coil of rope.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
Yes, sir.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.334
Gilligan, you didn't
remember to say

18:23.402 --> 18:24.669
what I told you,
did you?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.504
Yes, sir. I said no
exactly like you told me...

18:27.573 --> 18:28.639
Just before
i gave away the rope.

18:28.707 --> 18:29.607
Ooh, gilligan...

18:29.675 --> 18:31.208
You see those clouds
up there?

18:31.277 --> 18:32.809
Yeah. They're pretty.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.645
They're not pretty.
They could storm
any minute.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.380
Now you go out
on the double

18:36.449 --> 18:37.681
and get everything
that you loaned out.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.683
Hurry up.
On the double.
Yes, sir.

18:39.752 --> 18:40.918
Gilligan.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.652
Skipper, you don't
have to worry.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.122
If it starts to rain,
we can work inside.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.392
Gilligan, will you
get out of here
on the double?

18:51.230 --> 18:53.063
Come in.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.498
Oh, hello, gilligan.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.934
Hi, professor. This is sure
a nice place you got here.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.068
What are you doing?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.102
I'm making notes
for a book.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.171
You mean
you're writing a book?

19:00.239 --> 19:01.305
That's
one of the reasons

19:01.374 --> 19:02.539
I wanted to be
off by myself.

19:02.608 --> 19:03.741
It's gonna be
a chronicle

19:03.810 --> 19:04.641
of our adventures
on the island.

19:04.710 --> 19:05.909
No kidding.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.745
I think it's a book
people will buy. Don't you?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.214
Sure. I'll buy one.
I'm dying to find out
what happens to us.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.649
So am I.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.384
Could I have back
the chisel and saw
you borrowed?

19:13.452 --> 19:15.419
Oh, yeah.
I loaned the chisel
to the girls,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.454
but the saw's
right here somewhere.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.157
Gee.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.793
Gilligan, what did you
do to that wall?

19:22.862 --> 19:24.595
I'm sorry, professor.
All I did was pull out
this palm leaf,

19:24.664 --> 19:25.329
and the whole thing
fell down.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.563
Oh, come on.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.199
Honest, professor.
That's what happened.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.200
Don't try to tell me
that pulling out
one palm leaf

19:30.269 --> 19:31.736
will make a whole wall
fall down.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.275
I built this place,
you remember?

19:50.623 --> 19:51.822
You really like it,
gilligan?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.256
Yeah, girls.
Your place is beautiful.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.792
The professor
had a beautiful place--

19:54.860 --> 19:56.427
we're going to have
a beautiful garden
here,

19:56.495 --> 19:58.262
and then
we're going to--
[Sniff sniff]

19:58.331 --> 19:59.996
Mary Ann, your fudge
is burning.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.232
Oh. Oh, my goodness!
Oh...

20:02.301 --> 20:04.034
Oh. Oh, the door
won't open.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.437
Here, I'll get it.
Hold this. Here, allow me.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.472
Oh, thanks, gilligan.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.675
Aah! Aah!

20:13.779 --> 20:15.078
Mary Ann: Gilligan.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.447
Oh. All that
lovely work.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.781
Ohh...

20:17.850 --> 20:20.884
Well, at least
i fixed the door.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.353
Hi, Mr. howell.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.454
Well, gentlemen, we're
a little early, aren't we?

20:24.523 --> 20:27.358
Not that it matters.
Welcome to howell manor.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.692
Mr. howell
built a real nice hut,
didn't he, skipper?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.728
So did the others,
gilligan,

20:30.796 --> 20:32.396
but it just took
one little disaster
to leave them homeless.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.299
Uh, what disaster
you talking about?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.767
That's why we stopped by,
Mr. howell.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.302
We wanted to talk to you
about the community hut.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.436
You don't have to say
another word.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.771
Of course
I'll contribute.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.107
I give to the community hut
every year.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.842
No, Mr. howell.
The community hut
the seven of us built.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.644
And that five of you
tore down.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.145
If we could just work together
like we did before,

20:48.214 --> 20:50.013
we can rebuild it before
the rough weather sets in.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.283
Ha ha ha.
You and your
rough weather.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.718
I like
rough weather!

20:53.786 --> 20:55.418
I welcome
rough weather.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.854
May I say, captain,

20:56.922 --> 20:58.856
that this place is built
to withstand anything.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.790
You may
think it is--

20:59.859 --> 21:01.658
yeah, Mr. howell.
You may think it--

21:01.727 --> 21:03.494
quiet, gilligan.
Come over and sit down
and be quiet.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.528
I'll handle this.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.762
I assure you, captain,

21:05.831 --> 21:07.965
this place
is a veritable fortress.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.303
Aah! It's a veritable...

21:13.372 --> 21:15.339
Rock of Gibraltar.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.043
[Thunder]

21:29.788 --> 21:32.022
[Thunder]

21:32.090 --> 21:34.258
Oh, listen to that storm!

21:34.327 --> 21:35.960
How long do you think
this hut's gonna last?

21:36.028 --> 21:38.128
These walls should have
blown away hours ago.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.563
Why do you say that,
ginger?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.198
Because I helped
to put them up.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.666
What's keeping
my roof up, either?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.535
Lovey,
if anything happens,

21:44.603 --> 21:45.803
I want to thank you

21:45.872 --> 21:49.339
for 15 of the happiest years
a man ever had.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.409
Thurston,
we've been married 20.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.011
I know, but the last 5 years
have been a little shaky.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.014
I was only joking,
you see.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.882
Laughing
in the face of danger.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.918
We howells always have.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.653
Oh, my darling's
always so brave.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.656
Thank you. Grandfather howell
was the same way.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.926
When the stock market
crashed in 1929,

22:08.995 --> 22:11.461
did he show signs of panic
like the others?

22:11.530 --> 22:12.830
Did he show signs of fear?

22:12.898 --> 22:15.466
Not dear old granddad.
He just laughed and joked

22:15.534 --> 22:18.268
all the way down
to the pavement.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.870
Joke in the face of danger.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.972
Folks, let me
reassure you.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.841
This hut is solid as a rock.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.643
It'll withstand anything
that mother nature has
to throw at us.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.778
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

22:28.847 --> 22:31.481
The skipper's right.
This hut can stand
anything.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.016
I mean, look at this
construction here.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.385
Don't touch anything!

22:34.454 --> 22:36.119
Gilligan, do you want
the whole hut to fall down?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.154
I'm sorry, skipper.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.156
Gilligan,
after this disaster,

22:39.225 --> 22:40.590
you are in charge
of the passengers.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.360
Me? What about you?

22:42.428 --> 22:45.062
It's my duty as captain
to go down with the hut.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.365
Hey, listen.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.634
Listen? I don't
hear anything.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.903
That's what I mean.
The storm's over.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.173
Gilligan's right!

22:56.242 --> 22:57.974
Oh, we're saved!

22:58.043 --> 23:00.010
Oh, my walls
made it!

23:00.079 --> 23:02.746
Look at my roof!
It's as dry as a bone!

23:02.815 --> 23:04.915
Lovey, lovey,
we're saved!

23:04.984 --> 23:06.450
You know, thurston,

23:06.519 --> 23:09.853
the last 5 years
haven't been any picnic
for me, either.

23:09.922 --> 23:13.323
Folks, I told you
that we could
weather the storm.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.093
I'll go out and see
if there's any kind
of real damage.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.862
You see? The skipper
was right.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.431
If all of us
worked together,

23:20.500 --> 23:21.699
you're right.
We can do anything,
huh?

23:23.435 --> 23:24.568
Hey, skipper...

23:24.637 --> 23:26.036
What are you
doing in the lagoon?

23:26.104 --> 23:27.972
Never mind what am i
doing in the lagoon.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.507
What's the hut
doing out here?

23:30.576 --> 23:32.176
Throw me a line,
gilligan.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.512
Aye, aye, sir.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.115
Coming, skipper.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.590
This is mutiny!

23:57.969 --> 23:59.269
Oop!

23:59.338 --> 24:00.471
Gilligan!

24:02.841 --> 24:06.610
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.412
Little buddy--ha ha--
clear skies ahead.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.314
Uh-huh. And all the passengers
are building their own huts
again.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.516
And so are we.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.917
Now, I won't have
to remind you

24:13.986 --> 24:15.452
about lending
our tools out,
will I?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.154
No, no, n-o, no,
no, no, no, no.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.923
Okay, gilligan.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.691
Good boy.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.367
Hello...

24:30.436 --> 24:31.735
Gilligan.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.786
Aah! Uh-oh.

24:52.191 --> 24:56.660
Thank you.
Could you carry the box,
please? Great.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.765
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

25:01.833 --> 25:03.867
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:03.936 --> 25:06.369
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:06.438 --> 25:08.138
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:08.206 --> 25:10.407
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:10.476 --> 25:12.543
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:12.611 --> 25:14.711
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:14.780 --> 25:16.780
¶ in their
tropic island nest ¶

25:16.849 --> 25:18.082
¶ no phones, no lights ¶

25:18.150 --> 25:19.182
¶ no motorcars ¶

25:19.251 --> 25:21.218
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:21.287 --> 25:23.453
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:23.522 --> 25:25.322
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:25.391 --> 25:27.691
¶ so join us here each week,
my friends ¶

25:27.760 --> 25:29.692
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:29.761 --> 25:32.396
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:32.465 --> 25:34.298
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
