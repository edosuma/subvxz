WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:08.242
[theme music]

00:57.725 --> 00:58.892
Get you one of
these hogs, Gar.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.794
We're talking about
serious freedom.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.797
Boy, Jackie'd love
one of these things.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.799
It's not the point.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.034
It's like getting
a tattoo, babe.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.502
Even if you got the
lady's name on it,

01:08.602 --> 01:10.238
you're not getting it for her.
- Yeah.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.339
Yeah.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.473
You know, wouldn't it
be cheaper if I got

01:12.573 --> 01:14.975
one of those Japanese bikes?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.311
No, no, no, no.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.014
You don't want a bike that
sounds like Barry Manilow.

01:21.115 --> 01:27.054
You want one that
sounds like Steppenwolf.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.021
Get on her.

01:28.122 --> 01:28.989
See how she feels.

01:29.089 --> 01:29.890
Yeah?

01:32.993 --> 01:33.994
I'm in love.

01:34.094 --> 01:34.895
Huh?

01:34.995 --> 01:36.664
[revving]

01:36.764 --> 01:37.998
Whoa, beautiful!

01:42.636 --> 01:43.437
Incredible.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.638
I can still feel it.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.207
It's always like that.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.142
Do you guys want like
a cigarette or anything?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.380
We ready to go?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.281
No.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
Jackie's not even here yet.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.716
So what else is new?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.951
Listen, do me a favor, Dan,
and don't go getting all greasy

01:58.051 --> 02:00.154
because this is a very,
very nice restaurant

02:00.254 --> 02:01.455
we're going to tonight.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.692
Well, gee, Mom, me and
Eddie, we was just goofing off.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.026
Lovely dress, Mrs. Cleaver.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.101
What time's our
reservations for?

02:14.202 --> 02:15.736
10 minutes ago.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.471
She's always doing this to me.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.607
I'll be waiting for 45
minutes down at the cineplex

02:19.707 --> 02:22.776
while she's done at the
station printing perps.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.745
She actually said that?

02:24.845 --> 02:27.348
Printing perps?

02:27.448 --> 02:30.150
Yeah, she's really into
this police lingo stuff.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.752
You know, every time
I go over there,

02:31.852 --> 02:36.390
she's either eyeballing a
mugshot, grilling a dirtbag,

02:36.490 --> 02:39.693
or, uh, frisking a biscuit.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.463
Spanking a chicken.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.064
God, I hate that stupid job.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.033
Mom, I worked
it out with Becky.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.668
She's going to stay
home and babysit DJ,

02:47.768 --> 02:49.169
and I'm going to go out.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.739
Now, why would she
make a deal like that?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.708
Well, I had dirt on her.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.410
What kind of dirt?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.312
Now, if I told you,
I'd have to stay home.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.954
So what do you think your
punishment ought to be?

03:07.054 --> 03:07.855
What do you mean?

03:07.955 --> 03:10.691
Darlene told me everything.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.760
That little rat.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.728
I told her I wasn't going to
do anything about it until I

03:14.828 --> 03:15.963
get your side of the story.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.769
Well, first we--

03:21.869 --> 03:24.372
wait a minute.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.306
Uh-uh.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.174
[phone ringing]

03:27.275 --> 03:28.376
You're getting good.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.247
If that's Jackie, I'm
going to kill her.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.350
This better not be you.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.285
Oh, sorry.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.887
I thought you were
somebody else.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.255
Yeah, that's me.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.725
What-- what happened?

03:44.825 --> 03:45.659
Is-- did she get shot?

03:45.759 --> 03:46.960
BECKY: Oh, my God.
Aunt Jackie?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.362
GARY: She was shot?
- No, no.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.263
Shh.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.197
No.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.098
OK.

03:51.198 --> 03:51.999
Well, where is she?

03:52.099 --> 03:52.966
OK.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.468
Yeah, we'll be right there.
- What?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.769
What?
- OK, where's the keys?

03:55.869 --> 03:56.837
DAN: What's the
matter, Roseanne?

03:56.937 --> 03:58.138
She got injured
in the line of duty.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.640
We gotta get out of here.
Where are the keys?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.342
- How bad is it?
- They don't know.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.443
- Why not?
- I don't know.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.677
You want me to call
them back and ask them?

04:03.777 --> 04:04.645
Do you know what it--

04:04.745 --> 04:05.946
where's my keys?
- Here, I'll--

04:06.046 --> 04:07.014
- I gave them to you.
- Yeah, I'll drive.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.482
Damn it, I knew this
was going to happen.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.383
I'll drive.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.592
This is for the pain.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.895
Oh, make it a double.

04:21.995 --> 04:22.796
Jackie?

04:22.896 --> 04:25.032
JACKIE: Yeah, come on in.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.100
She's down here.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.201
Are you OK?

04:28.302 --> 04:30.270
Couldn't find
anybody out there.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.171
What happened?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.106
Oh, it was a nightmare.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.007
Oh, please.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.976
You just hurt your back.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.279
May I tell the story?

04:39.380 --> 04:40.814
Well, it was a--

04:40.914 --> 04:44.485
it was a 311.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.121
And it was on my beat, so
I was the first to respond.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.624
When I got to the scene, I
realized that the alleged

04:50.724 --> 04:54.227
perp was heavily intoxicated.

04:54.328 --> 04:59.867
And that meant not only was
it a 311, but a 402, as well.

04:59.967 --> 05:04.938
He resisted arrest, and there
was a struggle-- a 979er.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.007
And that's when things got ugly.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.409
He went for his gun.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.677
What gun?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.779
Your partner said the
guy was completely naked.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.652
It was dark.
It could have been a gun.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.923
And then they both fell
down a flight of steps.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.592
You tackled some
naked guy and you

05:24.692 --> 05:25.959
fell down the steps will him?

05:26.059 --> 05:30.998
Well, that's what they
pay me for, Roseanne.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.601
You know, if we hurry,
I think we can still

05:33.701 --> 05:35.068
make it to that restaurant.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.538
Wanna come, Jackie?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.773
I do have a herniated disk.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.509
Is there anything
we can get for you?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.410
No, I'll be all right.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.611
I'm fine.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.414
I'm just-- I'm sorry I
ruined everybody's night.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.581
No, don't be silly.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.116
We're just glad you're OK.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.117
Doctors tell you anything?

05:50.217 --> 05:51.585
How long you're gonna be here?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.522
They said I gotta stay here a
couple of days for observation.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.357
And then, after
that, take it easy.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.059
You know, bedrest.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.828
No physical exertion.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.664
Could I have a minute
with Jackie alone?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.332
Now, no physical exertion.

06:07.968 --> 06:08.769
OK.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.370
We'll be right outside.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.338
Listening.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.582
I hate seeing you lying
here in pain like this.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.184
Well, actually, ever
since she gave me that shot,

06:24.284 --> 06:26.820
I'm feeling kind of neat.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.922
I gotta tell you
something, honey.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.591
When we got that phone
call said you were hurt,

06:30.691 --> 06:32.826
I've never been so
scared in my life.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.029
Aw, you're so sweet.

06:36.129 --> 06:36.997
No, it's the truth.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.568
With your cute
little button nose.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.469
Um, thanks.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.936
Anyway--
- [giggles]

06:43.036 --> 06:44.705
--you know, every day
when you go off to work,

06:44.805 --> 06:46.306
I can't help but worrying
that you're going

06:46.406 --> 06:49.610
to get shot or stabbed.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.511
Why do you ask?

06:53.313 --> 06:55.583
Uh, you know, maybe we
better talk about this later.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.484
No.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.585
No, I'm OK.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.286
You said shot or stabbed.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.589
OK, so this time
it didn't happen.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.823
You just fell down the stairs.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.792
But I mean, here you are
in a hospital anyway.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.696
And-- and I mean, what happens
if next time maybe some jerk

07:08.796 --> 07:10.664
really does have a gun?

07:10.764 --> 07:11.665
Jackie, I know.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.867
I know that we've
talked about this,

07:13.967 --> 07:18.839
but I just don't know if
I can handle it anymore.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.212
[exhales]

07:37.625 --> 07:39.860
Jeez, why can't DJ
clean his own room?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.295
God, what a pig.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.297
How is Aunt Jackie gonna
stand sleeping in here?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.871
What is this?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.205
I think that's
his underwear, Beck.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.106
Ew!

07:56.443 --> 07:57.645
Where am I supposed
to put this junk?

07:57.745 --> 07:58.546
I don't know.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.680
Just shove it under the bed.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.117
What are these?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.459
Oh, my God.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.261
What?

08:14.361 --> 08:15.829
It's a box full
of little heads.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.840
Barbie.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.043
GI Joe.

08:30.143 --> 08:30.978
Oh, Cher!

08:34.915 --> 08:36.650
The little runt is psycho.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.719
What does he do, just cut
their heads off and throw

08:38.819 --> 08:40.287
away the rest of the parts?

08:44.758 --> 08:45.559
No.

08:49.462 --> 08:53.533
This is very creepy, Darlene.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.735
Well, let's just
put everything

08:54.835 --> 08:58.471
back exactly where it was.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.841
Hi!

09:00.941 --> 09:03.176
What are you doing?

09:03.276 --> 09:04.077
Nothing.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.779
Cleaning.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.214
We're just cleaning.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.782
Did you clean the closet?

09:08.882 --> 09:09.817
N-- no.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.718
No.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.819
Why?

09:11.919 --> 09:12.720
No reason.

09:15.856 --> 09:16.657
OK.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.557
Careful, Gary.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.826
You break her, you bought her.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.460
Very funny, Roseanne.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.729
There you go.

09:21.829 --> 09:22.663
Here.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.297
Just put her down
here in the bed.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.733
- Easy does it.
- OK.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.667
Careful.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.501
How you feeling, Aunt Jackie?

09:28.602 --> 09:30.537
A little stiff, Beck.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.571
Can we get you anything?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.539
No, I'll be fine.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.341
I'm OK.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.177
Roseanne, please stop fussing.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.346
No.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.683
Hey, Aunt Jackie, I
made you a get well card.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.754
Oh, Deej, look at that.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.791
Oh, you are such a good kid.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.425
He's got them all fooled.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.899
I brought the baggage, master.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.533
Where do you wish me to put it?

10:00.634 --> 10:03.470
[chuckles] Just put
it anywhere, Igor.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.674
Yes, master.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.076
Perhaps later you'll hit me?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.044
We'll see.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.981
You're too kind.

10:14.081 --> 10:14.882
How you doing?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.449
ALL: [fussing concurrently]

10:16.549 --> 10:17.350
No.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.719
Hey, no!
I'm OK.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.653
I'm fine, really.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.454
I just-- I need
some rest, though.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.223
- OK, I'll check with you later.
- OK.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.457
Gary?
Something wrong?

10:24.557 --> 10:25.793
What?
No.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.227
No.
No, I'm just incredibly late.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.361
I gotta go.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.462
OK, you guys.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.363
Come on.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.331
She needs to be all alone.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.232
Come on.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.001
Let's leave her alone here.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.803
Roseanne?
ROSEANNE: Hm?

10:35.903 --> 10:36.770
Can you stay?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.038
Yeah, I wasn't
gonna go anywhere.

10:38.138 --> 10:38.939
JACKIE: Oh.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
What's up?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.979
I found out yesterday
that, because of my back,

10:46.079 --> 10:49.282
I could wind up behind a desk.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
Oh, you poor thing.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.786
Can I do my little
happy dance now?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.090
Roseanne!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.859
How can you say that?

10:58.959 --> 11:01.762
You know how much being
a cop means to me.

11:01.862 --> 11:02.796
Oh, come on.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.131
Nothing's happened yet.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.598
It happens all the time.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.499
You get hurt.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.701
You can't do your job.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.170
They give you a little
pension and send you home.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.405
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't be a cop.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.708
Oh, there's a lot of
things you could do.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.576
I don't wanna
do anything else.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.080
I put on that uniform
and people respect me.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.015
I get to do something
that means something, that

11:22.115 --> 11:24.351
protects people
and helps people,

11:24.451 --> 11:27.620
even if it means
risking my life.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.657
Jackie, you tackled a
naked guy and grabbed for--

11:30.758 --> 11:32.893
I could've sworn it was a gun.

11:37.765 --> 11:38.565
What are you doing?

11:38.665 --> 11:39.599
Shopping for motorcycles.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.500
Oh, look!

11:40.600 --> 11:41.902
Here's a pip.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.072
'78 Harley in mint condition.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.639
We can't afford that.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.408
It's for Gary.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.845
Gary and I are planning
on forming a gang.

11:51.945 --> 11:56.183
You and your sister
will be our chicks.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.052
Then we plan on going out
terrorizing small communities

11:59.152 --> 12:00.220
on the weekends.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.189
Weather permitting.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.957
How's Jackie?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.658
Well, she's a bit
better, but I really

12:05.759 --> 12:07.094
don't think she should
leave, you know,

12:07.194 --> 12:09.329
until she's able to take
care of herself all the way.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.730
Ha!

12:10.831 --> 12:14.968
You know, you really
enjoy this nurturing crap.

12:15.068 --> 12:15.903
Do not.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.170
Do too.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.339
You've been real happy
the last couple of days,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.942
having somebody to take care of.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.812
Well, I guess it is
kind of cool having

12:24.912 --> 12:27.514
somebody depend
on me to feed them

12:27.614 --> 12:29.682
and take them to the bathroom.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.020
Besides you, that is.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.957
Mom, if DJ was doing
something weird--

12:37.057 --> 12:39.126
I don't mean just normal weird.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.760
I mean really weird--

12:40.861 --> 12:44.097
we'd have to send
him away, right?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.433
Yeah, but then he'd probably
just find his way back

12:46.533 --> 12:49.436
like you always do.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.238
What's going on?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.473
He's doing something
really weird.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.108
Gosh, I am so tired of it.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.609
You know, it's
really, really boring.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.311
Every time the
kid does anything,

12:58.411 --> 13:00.713
you girls come down here
squawking at me about it.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.650
Now, I told you before, he
doesn't do things the way

13:03.750 --> 13:04.551
you do them.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.685
He does them differently.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.987
He's a boy.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.155
Real different.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.293
Oh, it looks like DJ
got himself a hobby.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.697
Mother, these
are my old dolls!

13:17.797 --> 13:18.631
Ah, jeez.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.035
He's not playing
with dolls, is he?

13:22.135 --> 13:22.936
That's a relief.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.209
Do you guys think
this is insane?

13:29.309 --> 13:34.915
Well, this one does
kind of look like Darlene.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.484
Yeah, looks like she put
up quite a little struggle.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.923
You guys are sick.

13:43.023 --> 13:43.991
Come on.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.325
Just take them back
where you got them.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.459
Put them back.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.360
Mother!

13:49.997 --> 13:51.264
Becky, it's no big deal.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.565
Come on.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.434
I told you, he's a boy, and
boys do things like this.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
Now, go find something to do.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.470
All right, but
when we finally do

13:57.570 --> 13:59.106
have to lock the little
wacko in the basement,

13:59.206 --> 14:00.473
don't expect me
change his papers.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.812
Hey.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.847
Hey, bud.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.249
Got you a bike.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.317
Hey, great.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.718
Yeah, we'll check
it out this afternoon.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.054
Now all we gotta do is get you
one of those good, tough biker

14:14.154 --> 14:14.955
nicknames.

14:15.055 --> 14:15.989
All right.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.624
How about, uh, Psycho?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.226
No, we're saving that for DJ.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.196
I gotta go up and see Jackie.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.631
How is she?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.766
She's laying up
in bed, complaining.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.667
Well, I'm used to that.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.342
Hi.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.977
Gary!

14:37.077 --> 14:38.211
GARY: How you feeling?

14:38.311 --> 14:39.112
JACKIE: You tell me.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.517
Well, that was fun.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.718
Hey, these are for you.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.787
Thank you.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.257
Gary, what's wrong?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.426
Ever since my accident,
we haven't talked.

14:53.526 --> 14:58.765
Well, um, I'm gonna
buy that Harley.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.500
Great.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.505
And, um, things have
been real busy at work.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.873
Hey, listen.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.209
You remember Hank, who has
a sign shop next to me?

15:09.309 --> 15:12.980
Well, turns out that
his secretary is leaving

15:13.080 --> 15:15.382
at the end of this month.
- Gary--

15:15.482 --> 15:16.716
It's a great job.

15:16.816 --> 15:17.817
I have a job.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.352
Would you just think about it?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.587
Here we go again.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.223
Gary, you knew I was a cop
when we started dating.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.724
Yeah, but I always
thought that sooner or--

15:24.824 --> 15:26.226
You just thought
I would give it up.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.727
It was just a phase
I was going through.

15:27.827 --> 15:28.828
This month, she's a cop.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.033
And next month, maybe
she'll be a cowgirl.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.068
You got hurt.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.570
So just say, "I told you so."

15:37.670 --> 15:40.407
No, because this time, it's,
"I can't live like this."

15:40.507 --> 15:42.742
I mean, you know, forget the
fact that you're never home.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.777
And forget the fact that
we can't ever make plans

15:44.877 --> 15:46.079
because you don't
know what your life's

15:46.179 --> 15:47.347
going to be like that day.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.549
And forget that I can't
relate to any of your friends

15:49.649 --> 15:52.319
because all you do is sit
around and talk your cop talk.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.887
But Jackie, I'll be damned
if I'm going to get a phone

15:54.988 --> 15:59.326
call saying that my wife
is lying in some hospital.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.928
So I have to give up
something that I want

16:02.029 --> 16:03.296
because you can't deal with it?

16:03.396 --> 16:06.333
Don't you think that that
sounds a wee bit selfish?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.168
That's how I feel.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.870
Gary, I'm not going to let
somebody else run my life.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.971
That's not going to change.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.206
Well, I'm not going
to sit around waiting

16:13.306 --> 16:14.441
for that phone call.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.575
So what are we saying here?

16:15.675 --> 16:16.809
We're breaking up?

16:16.909 --> 16:20.080
Just tell me that you
won't be a cop anymore

16:20.180 --> 16:21.414
and this all goes away.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.056
Look, don't sell the bike.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.357
I know you got somebody
waiting for it,

16:30.457 --> 16:32.625
but my buddy really wants it.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.526
We will be there.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.628
Soon.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.030
Gary, come on.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.231
Oh, Dan, leave him alone.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.167
He's probably kissing
it and making it better.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.201
Come on, man.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.569
We gotta go We're
gonna lose the bike.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.371
Dan, I can't deal with
that bike right now.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.873
Um, I gotta get out of here.

16:46.973 --> 16:47.807
What's the matter?

16:47.907 --> 16:50.077
Did you guys have another fight?

16:50.177 --> 16:52.579
It was more than
just a fight, Roseanne.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.647
Well, what?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.683
It-- it's between her and me.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.251
I mean, it's-- it's a
problem that we've been

16:58.351 --> 17:01.221
having from the beginning.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.590
It's private, Roseanne.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.292
Fine.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.661
Jackie'll tell me.

17:08.761 --> 17:09.562
Sounds bad.

17:14.134 --> 17:14.967
It's over.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.403
Ah, man.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.304
Yeah.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.205
Well, these things happen.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.444
Listen, we're still gonna
do this bike thing, right?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.478
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.446
Definitely.
- Yeah.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.547
What, you gonna
give me a buzz, or?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.015
Absolutely.

17:29.116 --> 17:29.949
Hey, Gary.

17:30.049 --> 17:30.850
Yeah.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.857
Take care of yourself.

17:37.957 --> 17:38.758
Yeah, you too, Dan.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.599
Why, Jackie?

17:46.699 --> 17:47.800
How could you do
something like that

17:47.900 --> 17:50.137
without even discussing
it with my first?

17:50.237 --> 17:52.372
He's not your boyfriend.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.273
Oh, come on.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.341
This guy is great.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.742
All those little
irritating things you do?

17:55.842 --> 17:58.345
He thinks they're cute.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.614
He walked in here and
he gave me an ultimatum.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.816
He told me to quit the force.
- Well, so what?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.118
I've been telling
you to quit the force

18:05.218 --> 18:06.453
since the day you started.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.087
Yeah, and I've been
trying to break up with you,

18:08.188 --> 18:11.624
but you won't seem to go away.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.593
Look, becoming a
cop is something

18:13.693 --> 18:15.395
I worked very, very hard for.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.397
What would you do
if Dan just demanded

18:17.497 --> 18:19.432
that you give up the house
and the job and the kids?

18:24.237 --> 18:26.239
OK, bad example.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.040
Well, I'll tell you
what I would do, Jackie.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.342
I'd work it out with him.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.677
Well, there was
nothing to work out.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.212
I'm quitting the force.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.546
What?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.348
They told me that I'm going
to have to take a desk job,

18:35.448 --> 18:36.716
and I'm going to quit.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.251
I did not become a cop so I
could sit on my butt all day,

18:38.351 --> 18:39.386
typing.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.488
But it's the very same
thing that Gary wants.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.922
So now, why can't we
just rent a chapel

18:43.022 --> 18:43.890
and get this thing over with?

18:43.990 --> 18:45.258
No, forget it.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.260
Then he would think that I quit
just because he told me to.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.229
But you would know the truth!

18:49.329 --> 18:50.797
You let him live in ignorance.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.098
Men love that!

18:52.199 --> 18:55.702
Roseanne, I am going to do
exactly what you would do.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.805
You would never let a man
tell you how to run your life.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.907
I want somebody who will
love and support me no matter

19:01.007 --> 19:03.109
what, just like
Dan does for you.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.311
Are you insane?

19:04.411 --> 19:06.078
Do you know how many years
I had to put into Dan?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.447
You think he came
out of a box like?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.419
Now, you could put those
same years into Gary.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.587
I'm telling you, he is
the perfect guy for you.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.556
No, Roseanne, he's
the perfect guy for you.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.225
You just want him to
settle down and take care

19:18.325 --> 19:19.659
of your flaky sister
so you don't have

19:19.759 --> 19:20.693
to worry about her anymore.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.761
Well, that's OK.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.230
You don't have to
worry about her anymore

19:23.330 --> 19:24.931
because she's going
to be just fine!

19:35.508 --> 19:36.476
OK.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.646
So maybe-- maybe you
did the right thing.

19:39.746 --> 19:44.517
It's been kind of a
tough day for you.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.485
Yeah.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.120
Fell like crying some more?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.556
No.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.991
Wanna yell at me?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.660
No.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.395
Want a pizza?

19:55.495 --> 19:58.398
Yes.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.299
Extra cheese?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.300
Mhm.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.200
Pepperoni?

20:01.301 --> 20:02.201
Mhm.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.636
Sausage?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.772
Anchovies?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.674
No man is worth anchovies.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.581
I don't know why you
want to go home so soon.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.416
Well, Roseanne,
it's been a week.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.885
10 days.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.321
I'll just put these
out in the car.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.890
I'll miss you too, Dan.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.992
You sure you want to go?

20:26.092 --> 20:29.228
There's nobody there to talk
to, nobody to take care of you.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.499
I mean, it's just a crap
little hole of an apartment.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.267
You're depressing me.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.368
Well, now, if
you're depressed,

20:35.468 --> 20:37.304
you really shouldn't go.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.940
No, it's time that
I get on with my life.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.008
What are you going to do?

20:42.108 --> 20:43.142
I don't know.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.077
I got a little disability
pension coming in,

20:45.177 --> 20:48.147
and I got time to try stuff
I've always wanted to do.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.048
Like what?

20:49.148 --> 20:50.750
I'm not telling you.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.620
Every time I try something
new, you just make fun of it,

20:53.720 --> 20:54.654
like becoming a cop.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.556
You just don't lay off.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.024
Oh.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.827
I'm not going to do
anything like that.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.562
You can tell me what
you're going to do.

21:02.662 --> 21:07.667
I'm gonna-- I will totally
support whatever you choose.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.035
OK.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.739
Well, I was thinking of trying
something kind of artistic.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.707
You know, like being a
painter or a sculptor.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.377
Or I could join that
Lanford Community Theater.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.311
I could be an actor.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.053
Yeah, or you could
be a ballerina.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.455
You want to be a ballerina?

21:28.555 --> 21:29.356
Roseanne--

21:29.456 --> 21:30.690
Or you could be an astronaut.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.258
Yeah, you'd be a
great astronaut.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.961
You get to fly way up
high into outer space!

21:35.061 --> 21:37.330
Thank you for the support.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.698
Or you could be a kickboxer.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.367
No, a sumo wrestler.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.634
Bye-bye.

21:41.734 --> 21:45.137
No, a psychic.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.107
But then you knew
that, didn't you?
