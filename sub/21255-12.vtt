00:02.767 --> 00:04.100
- WALT: Last time
on "Still The King"--

00:04.200 --> 00:06.233
- You ever get caught pretending
to be someone you're not?

00:06.333 --> 00:07.500
- Ronnie?
- Ronnie?

00:07.600 --> 00:09.933
- I'm Vernon Brown, and I
always get center stage.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.667
- You are a handsome
and powerful man.

00:11.767 --> 00:13.133
- We thought you blew up.

00:13.233 --> 00:14.400
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.400
- We're not Hibachi guys.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.400
We work for the SEC.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.167
- JIM: We're after your boss.
- What?

00:19.267 --> 00:22.133
- Are you upset because Ronnie
proposed to your mama tonight?

00:22.233 --> 00:23.367
- What?

00:23.467 --> 00:24.567
- Did I do something wrong,
boss?

00:24.667 --> 00:26.867
- I am the king.

00:26.967 --> 00:29.700
- Oh, it's kinda like that
boobs and dragon show on HBO.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.567
- It's exactly
like that, Ronnie.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.667
- *

00:35.767 --> 00:38.600
* Just like most love stories
in the world *

00:38.700 --> 00:40.400
*

00:40.500 --> 00:43.433
* It all started
with a boy meets girl *

00:43.533 --> 00:47.267
* He was country's bad boy,
he was on her list *

00:47.367 --> 00:51.000
* But a one-night stand
turned into a tryst *

00:51.100 --> 00:54.467
* And two became three,
suddenly *

00:54.567 --> 00:58.233
* This ragtag crew
became a family *

00:58.333 --> 01:02.067
* He knocked her up,
not once but twice *

01:02.133 --> 01:05.867
* A cheap but effective
plot device *

01:05.967 --> 01:07.733
- * It's plot device

01:07.833 --> 01:11.133
- * Her head keeps calling it
just a fling *

01:11.233 --> 01:13.067
* But her heart keeps saying

01:13.167 --> 01:15.733
- * Heart keeps saying

01:15.833 --> 01:19.500
- * He's still the king

01:19.600 --> 01:20.700
- [clapping]

01:20.800 --> 01:23.633
- [gasps]

01:25.167 --> 01:28.233
- *

01:28.333 --> 01:31.667
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:31.767 --> 01:33.667
**

01:35.633 --> 01:37.933
- Hey, baby, I thought--
- Charlotte, have you seen my--

01:38.067 --> 01:42.433
- *

01:42.533 --> 01:43.667
- What are you guys doing?

01:43.767 --> 01:44.900
- Nothing.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.833
I was just getting some OJ.
- --pastry strudel.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.267
- Excuse me, I'm just gonna--

01:49.367 --> 01:51.600
- My bad, I actually
better get moving anyway.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.700
I got a meeting in
a couple of hours with Courtney.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100
- Wait.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.800
- I'll just head on out.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.233
Have a good day.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.700
- What?

02:02.800 --> 02:03.600
- Morning, ladies.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.067
- Why are you dressed for work?

02:05.133 --> 02:07.800
- Bad news, babe, Papa Bear's
gotta go into the old office.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.367
- Okay, Papa Bear
cannot become a thing.

02:10.467 --> 02:11.933
- Ronnie, our rehearsal dinner's
tonight.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.133
- I know. But trust me,
there's big things going down

02:14.233 --> 02:15.767
at the office,
and I need to be there.

02:15.867 --> 02:18.767
I'm doing it for us.
I promise to be at Betty's by 6.

02:18.867 --> 02:22.167
And I vow to never leave your
side for the rest of our lives,

02:22.267 --> 02:23.900
even when
you're in the bathroom.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.733
- Okay, maybe I should proof
your vows before tomorrow.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.933
- Whatever.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.600
Papa Bear, out.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.233
- *

02:33.333 --> 02:35.900
- Can't wait for Papa Bear
to hibernate.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.533
- I'll sleep when I'm dead.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.700
- *

02:43.367 --> 02:45.333
- Jim, put that away.
We've got company.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.067
- I can see that, Gene.
I've got eyes.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.400
- Alright, what do you want?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.767
- Turns out, Coy is an amoral,
hedonistic, omnisexual

02:52.867 --> 02:54.067
gentleman of leisure.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.200
Those are his words.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.467
It's how he introduces himself
to people.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.167
Plus, he framed me.

02:58.267 --> 02:59.600
Trident Marina is in my name,

02:59.700 --> 03:01.500
and it's neither trident
nor marina.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.067
- You had your chance.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.500
You're just as guilty as Coy.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.133
You're going down with the ship.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.500
- What? No. I'll do anything.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.067
Seriously, anything.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.633
- Okay.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.367
First, you're gonna have
to wear these cufflinks.

03:15.467 --> 03:16.700
- Cufflinks?

03:16.800 --> 03:19.133
- Leftie is the camera,
righty is a microphone.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.767
- Oh.
Hey, Born. James Born.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.967
- Look, Coy needs to admit
on record that he framed you

03:28.067 --> 03:30.567
by tomorrow, or you're taking
the fall alone.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.267
- Ooh, bit of a problemo, Haus.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.633
I custom-tailor my shirts.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.100
Uh, sleeves can't contain me.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.133
- No. No way.

03:44.233 --> 03:45.200
It's not gonna happen.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.067
You remember
what happened last time?

03:48.500 --> 03:49.933
- He's your size.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.867
- *

03:55.167 --> 03:57.467
- So you just went from
the center of the vase outward

03:57.567 --> 04:00.133
and just ground it with
the bigger flowers, okay?

04:00.233 --> 04:02.200
- Oh.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.067
Very novice approach, Debbie.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.800
The greenery, or filler
as you so cutely refer to it,

04:07.900 --> 04:10.167
is actually the secret
to any balanced arrangement.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.633
- Wow. Those are phenomenal.
- Yep.

04:15.733 --> 04:19.167
My ex-wife Cynthia said
my crafty side was emasculating.

04:19.267 --> 04:20.533
But I know that's not true.

04:20.633 --> 04:21.900
- That makes sense.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.533
- Okay, here are
the rest of the place cards.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.167
But are the seating assignments
really necessary?

04:26.267 --> 04:29.800
- Yes. So I don't get stuck
next to some lurky uncle

04:29.900 --> 04:32.067
who keeps complimenting
my earlobes.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.967
- I will quarantine Uncle Fred
at the end of the end.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.767
Kaitlynn, I will put you next
to Ronnie's cousin, Tanner.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.667
Confident with a great smile.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.467
Just don't get him started
on ATVs.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.600
- Mm, mommy likes.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.833
He's allowed
exclusive earlobe access.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.933
- Ladies, have you seen
the baby's breath?

04:50.067 --> 04:51.067
- Sorry, Doily.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.167
- Charlotte, I'm gonna put you
on my left,

04:53.267 --> 04:54.267
across from Grandmother.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.200
And then Vernon and I
will sit here.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.433
- Uh, you mean Ronnie.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.100
- Yeah, that's what I said.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.633
Ronnie and I will sit here.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.300
- Babe, you said Vernon.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.333
- That's crazy.

05:04.433 --> 05:06.367
Why would I say Vernon?

05:06.467 --> 05:07.867
- That's rhetorical, right?

05:07.967 --> 05:10.067
- Ronnie, Vernon, okay, they
both have "ons" in their names,

05:10.167 --> 05:11.367
and it gets confusing.

05:11.467 --> 05:12.600
- Really?

05:12.700 --> 05:13.967
That's the defense
you're gonna go with?

05:14.067 --> 05:15.333
- Mm-hmm, yeah, it is.

05:15.433 --> 05:18.200
Exactly what I'm
gonna go with, yep.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.300
- Uh, hey.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.533
We're out
of baby's breath, okay?

05:22.633 --> 05:25.533
It's over! Call it off!

05:25.633 --> 05:27.667
We're out of baby's breath!

05:27.767 --> 05:30.333
It's no more! Anything no!

05:30.433 --> 05:32.967
Ah, God, thank God!

05:33.067 --> 05:34.233
That was close!

05:34.333 --> 05:35.633
That was close.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.200
- Vernon, you are my favorite

05:37.300 --> 05:38.667
soon-to-be back-on-top
superstar.

05:38.767 --> 05:39.867
I mean,
you're the franchise, baby.

05:39.967 --> 05:41.500
- Man, if I was
soon-to-be back-on-top,

05:41.600 --> 05:42.967
when's my new single coming out?

05:43.067 --> 05:44.233
- Oh, tonight.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.367
- Tonight?

05:45.467 --> 05:46.400
How's it coming out tonight?

05:46.500 --> 05:47.833
It ain't even mixed yet.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.067
- Mixed.

05:49.133 --> 05:50.400
It's been remixed.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.333
- WOMAN: Alright,
rehearsal's up,

05:51.433 --> 05:53.400
let's take it from the top.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.767
- * If you heard me
coming to my right *

05:56.867 --> 06:00.433
* I'd be forever wondering why

06:00.533 --> 06:04.600
* I never found my destiny

06:04.700 --> 06:07.633
* [unintelligible]

06:07.733 --> 06:10.067
*

06:10.133 --> 06:11.733
* I wouldn't be me

06:11.833 --> 06:13.733
*

06:13.833 --> 06:15.867
* I wouldn't be me

06:15.967 --> 06:17.400
*

06:17.500 --> 06:19.633
* I wouldn't be me

06:19.733 --> 06:21.067
*

06:21.133 --> 06:23.133
* I wouldn't be me

06:23.233 --> 06:24.700
*

06:24.800 --> 06:26.400
* I wouldn't be me

06:26.500 --> 06:30.100
* Me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me *

06:30.200 --> 06:32.133
*

06:32.233 --> 06:35.067
* I wouldn't be me *

06:35.133 --> 06:38.133
- COURTNEY: [cheering]

06:38.233 --> 06:39.700
The work of genius!

06:39.800 --> 06:41.300
- WOMAN: That sounds great,
everyone, let's take five.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.533
- It's crap.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.967
- I am gonna totally nail
Artist of the Year!

06:46.067 --> 06:47.467
Ohhh! [laughs]

06:47.567 --> 06:49.100
- Con artist of the Year.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.433
- Hell, you stole my song.

06:50.533 --> 06:53.700
- Mm. Last I remember, we
practically wrote it together.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.300
- You blurted out
a couple words.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.700
I wrote the song for Debbie.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.133
- Well, I'm releasing it as
Regina's first single tonight,

06:59.233 --> 07:01.100
immediately following
her live performance

07:01.200 --> 07:02.133
on my streaming service.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.800
- That's not gonna
work for me, Haus.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.900
That song's about me
singing it to Debbie.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.300
- Okay, that's why you're
getting songwriting credit.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.100
- That means nothing to me if
I ain't singing it for Debbie.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.767
- Vern, this is
a big payday for you.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.100
The song is a hit.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.467
- It used to be a hit.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.667
You turned it into
a freaking freak show.

07:18.767 --> 07:20.567
- Okay, okay, look,
it's a moot point.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.733
You signed away

07:21.833 --> 07:23.267
all your licensing rights
to me months ago.

07:23.367 --> 07:24.567
- Like hell I did.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.733
- You didn't have your lawyer
look over the paperwork?

07:26.833 --> 07:29.067
- Yeah, the lawyer
that you recommended.

07:29.133 --> 07:31.233
- Oh, right.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.833
See this?

07:32.933 --> 07:34.767
This proves
that I own the song,

07:34.867 --> 07:36.933
and I can do with it
as I please.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.267
- That's bull!

07:38.367 --> 07:40.533
- [screaming]
- No! My CDs!

07:40.633 --> 07:41.833
- Security! Security!

07:41.933 --> 07:43.800
Could you please escort
Mr. Vernon Brown

07:43.900 --> 07:45.800
off the premises and make sure
he doesn't come back.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.067
- This ain't over, Courtney!

07:47.167 --> 07:49.433
- I made as much money off
of you as I can,

07:49.533 --> 07:51.067
so, yes, it is.
It's pretty much over.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.333
- *

07:52.433 --> 07:55.067
- [screams]

07:55.133 --> 07:56.867
- Now it's over!

07:56.967 --> 07:57.933
I got it!

07:58.067 --> 07:59.200
- *

08:02.400 --> 08:04.933
- *

08:08.267 --> 08:11.067
- [coughing]

08:11.100 --> 08:11.967
- Ronnie.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.067
Come join us in the sauna.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.067
It's delightful.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.967
Isn't that right, Vance?
- Yeah.

08:17.067 --> 08:20.667
Like ten hours into our
hot box detox, I feel great.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.467
- Let's go, two more hours.

08:22.567 --> 08:25.333
- *

08:32.500 --> 08:33.600
- Well, the cufflinks are out.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.767
Damn.

08:34.867 --> 08:36.467
Coy's good.

08:36.567 --> 08:39.333
- *

08:41.067 --> 08:43.500
- Maybe we
can--what's he doing?

08:43.600 --> 08:44.867
- No.

08:44.967 --> 08:47.900
He wouldn't shove that
up--oh, God, yes, he would.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.133
- I understand the microphone.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.300
But why would he put
the camera up there?

08:56.333 --> 08:57.933
- BOTH: [grimaces]

08:58.067 --> 09:03.933
- *

09:04.067 --> 09:05.167
- Oh hey, guys.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.833
- Oh, Ronnie.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.567
- Time for a pat down.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.233
I'm just joking.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.833
- Who put a light
on that thing?

09:11.933 --> 09:13.600
- You wanted lights
on all the tech.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.500
- You know, I was a fool to get
tangled up with those agents.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.567
But I want you to know, this
stallion is no one-trick pony.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.600
- Well, now that's
good to know.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.833
Because we were dreading
having to shoot

09:24.933 --> 09:28.067
our prized pony on the track.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.333
- Speak for yourself.

09:29.433 --> 09:33.267
- So, tell me, what is the dirt
on that marina?

09:34.467 --> 09:36.200
Go on.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.800
- COY: Ronnie, we'll get
into that later.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.167
First, it's time for us
to celebrate

09:41.267 --> 09:43.667
your impending nuptials
with the other ponies.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.133
- Okay.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.467
[yelps]
- COY: Giddity-up.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.133
- How is he operating the zoom?

09:51.233 --> 09:52.933
- It really is a tight angle.

09:54.067 --> 09:55.633
- I can't believe this.

09:55.733 --> 09:56.867
I wrote the song for Debbie,

09:56.967 --> 10:00.100
now it looks like
I'm losing both of 'em.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.667
- We could always crash
her performance tonight?

10:02.767 --> 10:04.067
- Security's got my mug

10:04.167 --> 10:07.767
all over their kick his ass
if you see 'im list.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.600
- What if they don't
see your ass?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.300
You don't physically
have to be there.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.967
These streaming sites
are usually pretty low stakes.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.633
Makeup tutorials, cute animals,

10:15.733 --> 10:17.267
babies laughing,
blah, blah, blah.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.467
But low stakes
means low security.

10:19.567 --> 10:22.233
If I can access one
of their accounts, I can get

10:22.333 --> 10:26.300
into their streaming services
and their videos.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.133
Oh, it's pass protected.

10:29.233 --> 10:31.767
- Uh, statistically, people use
their date of birth

10:31.867 --> 10:34.400
and their pet's name
for their password,

10:34.500 --> 10:37.667
but the odds of guessing that
combination are astronomical.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.233
- Try "password."

10:39.333 --> 10:40.333
- Yeah, right.

10:40.433 --> 10:41.433
- [computer dings]

10:41.533 --> 10:42.500
- Ah, it worked.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.733
We're in.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.767
- WALT: Password?
- Nice.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.800
Now when Regina
starts her show tonight,

10:47.900 --> 10:49.500
we can turn it
into whatever we want.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.867
- Can we finally tell the world
we're living in a simulation?

10:51.967 --> 10:54.733
- After Vernon does his version
of the song, absolutely.

10:54.833 --> 10:55.867
- First things first.

10:55.967 --> 10:58.300
- Hot damn,
you guys are brilliant.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.067
I mean, hell's bells,
let's call the band,

11:00.167 --> 11:01.600
get 'em over here right now.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.667
Let's perform the song for
the whole world to see and hear.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.233
- Okay, it's not
the whole world.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.800
You have to take
those expectations down

11:07.900 --> 11:09.067
just like a little bit.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.500
It's gonna be like
500,000 to a million.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.500
- Hell, that's enough.
- That's a lot of people.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.633
- Let's do it.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.133
Get ahold of Mo.

11:15.233 --> 11:18.400
- *

11:18.500 --> 11:21.867
- I can't wait for Ronnie to see
how great this all looks.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.333
Do you know Ronnie
loves sunflowers?

11:24.433 --> 11:27.200
Ronnie, is gonna think
this is all fantastic.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.867
- Say his name all you want,
but that doesn't change the fact

11:29.967 --> 11:32.967
that you have feelings
for Vernon.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.367
- Okay, fine, we had a moment.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.233
- [gasps]

11:36.333 --> 11:38.133
Define moment.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.100
- Alright, I was
trying on my wedding dress,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.800
and he told me
I looked beautiful.

11:41.900 --> 11:45.133
And when I turned
around...he kissed me.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.067
- [gasps]
- Oh my God, Mom!

11:47.100 --> 11:49.400
- Oh, that is
definitely a moment.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.700
- I didn't kiss him back.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.067
- If you have feelings for Dad,

11:53.100 --> 11:55.300
how can you just go on
ignore them?

11:55.400 --> 11:56.200
- I know.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.300
Babe, it's just complicated.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
I mean, sometimes when
you're an adult, you just--

12:02.500 --> 12:05.167
you have to make choices that
aren't black and white.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.133
- And that's why adults
are allowed to drink.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.300
- Honey, me marrying Ronnie,

12:11.400 --> 12:14.433
it doesn't mean that Vernon
can't be in your life.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.367
Just not mine.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.767
Damn it, this baby is playing
hackesack with my bladder.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.300
I gotta pee again.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.133
- I have to tell my dad.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.567
I have to tell my dad how she
feels, he has feelings for her.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.633
What am I supposed to do?
- Don't get involved.

12:30.733 --> 12:33.500
Don't get
involved--alright, fine!

12:33.600 --> 12:36.933
I'm not telling you what to do,
but I'm also not

12:37.067 --> 12:40.633
not gonna tell you
to go tell Vernon.

12:40.733 --> 12:43.267
- Just to be clear,
you are saying that I should--

12:43.367 --> 12:45.067
- Tell Vernon what the hell
is going on.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.400
I will cover for you here.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.533
- Okay. Okay, right.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.133
Same--same page.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.067
- ALL: [laughing]

12:54.100 --> 12:56.467
- What do you think?
It's your turn.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.667
Yee-haw!

12:57.767 --> 13:00.967
- *

13:01.067 --> 13:03.133
- COY: Get out
the branding iron.

13:03.233 --> 13:04.600
Can you imagine?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.100
- ALL: [laughing]

13:06.200 --> 13:07.167
- Hey, Coy.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.300
- Oh, Ronnie.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.133
- I got some ideas
on Trident Marina

13:10.233 --> 13:13.067
I was gonna boomerang off of ya.
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.967
- How 'bout some shop talk?

13:15.067 --> 13:16.400
- Now's not the time
for business.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.600
The only thing I like mixing
with pleasure is pleasure.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.700
- *

13:26.567 --> 13:28.600
- Hey, bud.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.800
[laughs]

13:29.900 --> 13:32.300
- Oh, yeah. [laughs]

13:32.400 --> 13:35.267
- What's the most illegal thing
you've done in this office?

13:35.367 --> 13:37.733
- MAN: I used
Coy's Hula password.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.433
- ALL: [laughing]

13:39.533 --> 13:40.467
- Hey!

13:40.567 --> 13:42.233
Who's done anything
crazy recently?

13:42.333 --> 13:44.800
[laughs] Speak up, speak up!

13:44.900 --> 13:46.333
Enunciate. Enunciate.

13:46.433 --> 13:49.800
Hey, what's Coy
been up to recently?

13:49.900 --> 13:51.067
I'm gonna shred you

13:51.167 --> 13:53.367
like we shredded those files
last week, right?

13:53.467 --> 13:55.967
- Only thing getting shredded,
pony boy, is you.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.100
- [laughs] Hey, Bern,
how you're doing?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.067
What are you thoughts
on Trident Marina?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.667
- It's fit
for Poseidon himself.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.067
- BOTH: [laughing]

14:03.167 --> 14:04.467
- [choking]

14:04.567 --> 14:06.900
- You ever think about
growing a mustache?

14:07.067 --> 14:08.667
You should. The babes love it.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.300
- [phone ringing]

14:23.100 --> 14:24.700
- Uh, Coy.
- Yeah?

14:24.800 --> 14:27.067
- Can I have a word?
- Sure, Ronnie.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.067
- You know, you're
like a father to me.

14:29.167 --> 14:32.067
- Oh, interesting
role play choice.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.833
Okay, go on.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.867
Uh. Mmm.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.533
- Coy Fisher--
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.167
- --would you do me the honor
of being my best man?

14:41.267 --> 14:42.633
Who's utmost duty
is to come with me

14:42.733 --> 14:44.667
to my rehearsal dinner
right now?

14:44.767 --> 14:48.200
- I mean, I get to be
in the wedding party?

14:48.300 --> 14:49.333
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

14:49.433 --> 14:52.800
- Well, then yes!
A thousand times yes!

14:52.900 --> 14:56.333
- [applause]

14:58.800 --> 15:01.633
- [guitar tuning]

15:04.167 --> 15:06.767
- Val, don't you just love
the romance of twinkly lights?

15:06.867 --> 15:08.667
- No.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.633
- Remember, just start
on Mo's kick drum,

15:10.733 --> 15:13.367
then pan up me,
then pretty much

15:13.467 --> 15:15.067
just hold there
until the end of the song.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.333
- Dad!

15:17.433 --> 15:19.067
I need to talk to you.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.300
- Honey, could this wait?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.533
- I don't think so.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.433
Mom has feelings for you.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.933
- God, I wish that was true,
baby, but I took my shot.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.067
It was a mistake.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.200
- No, I don't think so.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.900
She literally can't stop
thinking about you.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.867
You need to go and talk to her.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.933
- We're about T-minus 15 minutes
until Regina's performance.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.200
What do you wanna do?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.133
- Leia, can we take this rodeo
on the road?

15:40.233 --> 15:41.667
- I can take over the stream
from anywhere.

15:41.767 --> 15:44.900
Just give me a minute
to get my stuff.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.400
Ready.
- Let's go.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.500
- What about us?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.333
I'm so glad we all rushed
over here for nothing.

15:53.433 --> 15:54.667
- It's exciting though.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.800
It's like we're all sidekicks
in someone else's story.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
- *

15:59.067 --> 16:00.600
- Get it off!

16:00.700 --> 16:04.633
- Finally
as a happily married man,

16:04.733 --> 16:08.833
my best advice to you would be
to stay open to everyone

16:08.933 --> 16:11.667
who presents themselves
along the way.

16:11.767 --> 16:14.800
To my dominant stallion
and his mare.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.233
Yeehaw!

16:16.333 --> 16:19.667
- ALL: Yeehaw.

16:19.767 --> 16:23.100
- Ah, do you trust
this woman, Ronnie?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.400
- With all my heart.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.433
- With all of our secrets?

16:27.533 --> 16:31.533
- What secrets
exactly do you mean?

16:31.633 --> 16:34.167
- Well, you know, that little
legal bait and switch

16:34.267 --> 16:36.600
that we've been running
through the sham

16:36.700 --> 16:40.933
of Trident Marina
that I put your name on.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.900
- Yes, yes.

16:43.067 --> 16:45.167
[laughs] Yes.

16:45.267 --> 16:46.133
Nature calls.

16:46.233 --> 16:47.100
I'll be back, babe.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.100
- Okay.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.733
[chuckles]

16:54.133 --> 16:57.467
Has Ronnie hipped you to
the concept of [unintelligible]?

16:59.300 --> 17:01.733
- VERNON: Excuse me.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.333
If could have
a moment of y'alls time.

17:04.433 --> 17:06.367
I'm Vernon Brown.

17:06.467 --> 17:08.833
Um...I wanna play this song

17:08.933 --> 17:12.800
for a very special lady
in the audience tonight.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.967
I need to play it for her now
before it's too late.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.400
- *

17:21.133 --> 17:23.167
- I wanna play this song
for a very special lady

17:23.267 --> 17:25.433
in the audience tonight.

17:25.533 --> 17:26.900
- [indistinct chatter]

17:27.067 --> 17:28.967
- Alright, are you
all ready to rock?

17:29.067 --> 17:31.433
- [crowd cheering]

17:31.533 --> 17:34.133
- [static hums]

17:34.233 --> 17:37.600
- * If I never see
your smile again *

17:37.700 --> 17:40.733
- What the [bleep] is this?
Cut it.

17:40.833 --> 17:43.833
- * Never want
to touch your skin *

17:43.933 --> 17:46.600
*

17:46.700 --> 17:52.100
* [unintelligible]

17:52.200 --> 17:56.267
* If I couldn't love you,
I wouldn't be me *

17:56.367 --> 17:58.067
*

17:58.133 --> 18:02.067
* If the night couldn't kiss
the morning sun *

18:02.167 --> 18:04.367
*

18:04.467 --> 18:06.233
* Like a river that has no

18:06.333 --> 18:08.600
- Wow, we're at 5,000
views and counting.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.100
- Whoa.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.133
- * God only knows
where I might be *

18:14.233 --> 18:16.833
*

18:16.933 --> 18:22.667
* If I didn't love you,
I wouldn't be me **

18:32.133 --> 18:33.933
- I wrote that song
for you, Deb.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.467
- [crowd ohs]

18:35.567 --> 18:39.167
- *

18:52.067 --> 18:53.100
- [slaps]

18:53.200 --> 18:57.433
- [audience ohs]

18:57.533 --> 18:58.667
- This is good, this is good.

18:58.767 --> 19:02.067
- [indistinct chatter]

19:02.167 --> 19:05.867

19:08.633 --> 19:11.900
- [applause]

19:14.900 --> 19:15.900
Read the room, Doily.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.967
Not the time, not the time.

19:18.067 --> 19:21.267

19:21.367 --> 19:24.567
- [knocking]

19:24.667 --> 19:26.133
- Did you hear that? I did it!

19:26.233 --> 19:27.533
Let's go lasso that SOB.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.667
- Oh, it takes
a few days to process.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.867
Sometimes while criminals
screw themselves.

19:31.967 --> 19:33.433
- Damn, that's anticlimactic.

19:33.533 --> 19:34.633
- Tell me about it.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.400
- Well, I guess you guys
want these back.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.733
- No, no, no.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.233
Those are all yours.
You can keep 'em.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.233
- Are you sure?

19:40.333 --> 19:41.633
- Little parting gift,
if you will.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.067
- They're nice.
- No, they're yours.

19:43.167 --> 19:44.533
- Alright, thanks.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.300
[sniffs]

19:48.733 --> 19:50.667
- Okay, Deb, maybe
I deserve that slap.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.433
- You deserve
a lot more than a slap

19:52.533 --> 19:53.933
for what you just did out there.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.533
- You're the one who apparently
can't get me out of your head.

19:56.633 --> 19:57.933
- Because you won't let me!

19:58.067 --> 20:00.233
- Well, now you don't have to.
I'm all in, Deb.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.233
Me and you, right now,
let's get out of here.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.733
- Vernon, stop.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.867
I'm marrying Ronnie.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.867
- Are you telling me
you're gonna be happy with him?

20:07.967 --> 20:10.000
- No, I'm gonna
be secure with him.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.067
- You want security, maybe you
outta get a damn alarm system.

20:13.167 --> 20:18.233
- Vernon, security...is a man
who remembers my birthday,

20:18.333 --> 20:21.867
who helps me build a crib,
who gives me my dream proposal.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.467
Security is the man who
actually comes home at night,

20:24.567 --> 20:26.067
not just sing about it.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.933
- Deb, I wrote
that song for you.

20:30.033 --> 20:31.767
I mean, that's my feelings,
that's my heart.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.333
- You said audience out there.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.567
You said there's a special lady
in the audience,

20:35.667 --> 20:38.700
Vernon, you will always
need that attention.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.267
I can't be your audience
anymore.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.000
- That's not what I meant.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.767
- Vernon, just...be selfless
for once

20:46.867 --> 20:48.533
and let me get on with my life.

20:48.633 --> 20:51.000
- *

21:01.300 --> 21:03.367
- Come on, man,
let's go get a drink.

21:03.467 --> 21:05.867
- Not right now, man.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.500
I need to be alone.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.867
- * That's just me loving you

21:11.967 --> 21:15.267
*

21:15.367 --> 21:18.567
- [phone ringing]

21:18.667 --> 21:19.767
- COURTNEY: Vernon,
you're a genius!

21:19.867 --> 21:21.100
I got that slap on tape, man.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.933
Classic heartfelt gesture fail!

21:23.067 --> 21:24.900
Oh, and the song's a hit!

21:25.067 --> 21:27.667
- *

21:27.767 --> 21:32.400
* I'll still be loving you
loving me *

21:32.500 --> 21:34.867
*

21:38.700 --> 21:42.100
- *

21:44.067 --> 21:49.233
* Don't try to tempt me
with your evil lies *

21:49.333 --> 21:52.133
*

21:52.233 --> 21:55.133
- Ah!

21:55.233 --> 21:58.667
[slurping]

21:58.767 --> 22:01.133
- *

22:01.233 --> 22:04.100
- VANCE: Like ten hours into
our hot box detox, I feel great!

22:07.267 --> 22:09.367
- *
