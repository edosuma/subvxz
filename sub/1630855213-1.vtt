00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.600
Woman:
"Behold her,

00:13.734 --> 00:15.266
"single in the field.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.433
"Yon solitary Highland lass,

00:17.567 --> 00:20.567
"reaping and singing by herself.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.233
"Stop here, or gently pass.

00:23.367 --> 00:25.300
"Alone she cuts and binds
the grain,

00:25.433 --> 00:28.400
"and sings a melancholy strain.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.900
"Oh listen,
for the Vale profound

00:31.033 --> 00:33.700
"is overflowing with the sound.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.900
"No sweeter voice was ever heard

00:36.033 --> 00:38.700
"in springtime
from the cuckoo-bird.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.133
"Breaking the silence
of the seas

00:41.266 --> 00:43.567
"among the furthest Hebrides.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.233
"Will no one tell me
what she sings?

00:46.367 --> 00:48.867
"Perhaps the plaintive
numbers flow

00:49.000 --> 00:53.400
"for old unhappy far-off things
and battles long ago.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.600
"Whate'er the theme,
the maiden sang

00:55.734 --> 00:58.633
"as if her song
could have no ending.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.533
"I saw her singing at her work
and o'er the sickle bending.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.834
"The music in my heart I bore,

01:04.967 --> 01:09.000
"long after it was heard
no more."

01:09.133 --> 01:11.333
It's crazy, I have read that
poem a million times

01:11.467 --> 01:13.367
and it's now only just
coming to life.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.200
Ah, well,
that's Wordsworth for you.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.767
This is what I meant about
his connection

01:17.900 --> 01:19.667
to the natural world.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.467
He believed that poetry should
be written to provide pleasure

01:23.600 --> 01:26.934
through a rhythmic and powerful
expression of emotion.

01:27.066 --> 01:29.533
It's risky to say
what we're feeling.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.266
Scary, even.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.767
Well, I have to admit,
I was a little scared about

01:33.900 --> 01:36.533
taking this class, but I've
actually really enjoyed it.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.033
Are you coming back next
semester?

01:39.166 --> 01:40.967
Dr. Tompkins will be back
from sabbatical,

01:41.100 --> 01:42.767
but I am-- I'm working on it.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.800
Well, I hope so,
you have been incredible.

01:44.934 --> 01:46.633
Great example of hyperbole.

01:46.767 --> 01:48.633
You've clearly been paying attention.

01:49.633 --> 01:52.133
Oh, and as a thank you,

01:52.266 --> 01:54.834
I got you some of that British
chocolate that you love.

01:54.967 --> 01:56.934
My friend brought it back from
her studies abroad.

01:57.066 --> 01:58.433
You're my favorite student.

01:58.567 --> 02:00.900
I try.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.600
See you later. Bye.

02:04.033 --> 02:05.867
Next.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.433
Dr. Lambert?

02:12.867 --> 02:14.200
Dean Grant.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.600
May I?

02:15.734 --> 02:17.900
Uh, please.

02:18.033 --> 02:19.900
Looks like you've made a lot
of fans here

02:20.033 --> 02:21.767
over the last three months.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.567
Well, luckily I happen to be
teaching my favorite subject.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.166
Well, it shows, Joss.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.266
Well, hopefully it will give me
a better shot

02:29.400 --> 02:30.600
at my interview next month.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.500
I know that tenure track positions

02:32.633 --> 02:34.100
are extremely competitive

02:34.233 --> 02:36.367
so if there's anything else
I can do to stand out...

02:36.500 --> 02:38.433
Well, getting the interview in
the first place

02:38.567 --> 02:40.166
is half the battle.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.767
But...

02:41.900 --> 02:44.367
I just heard from
the Literary Review.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.266
They kicked your paper back.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.033
You're kidding.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.834
They're intrigued by your
dissection of Wordsworth's work,

02:50.967 --> 02:53.400
but they're not feeling like
you're saying anything new.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.166
Something is missing.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.433
Also your lack of published work
is a problem.

02:58.567 --> 02:59.867
I've been published.

03:00.066 --> 03:02.567
But it hasn't been cited
or won any awards.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.967
Department funding is vital
for this.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.900
Funding...

03:07.033 --> 03:08.800
You know I'm on your side.

03:08.934 --> 03:10.400
Yes, I'm sorry.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.967
They're giving you two weeks
to re-submit.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.133
You know, when I was your age,

03:16.266 --> 03:18.467
there were a lot of roadblocks,
and I pushed through

03:18.600 --> 03:20.133
and I worked hard.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.633
Sometimes I thought I couldn't
do it, but I did.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.166
And I know you can too...

03:26.400 --> 03:27.934
Joss?

03:28.066 --> 03:29.467
Are you okay?

03:30.700 --> 03:31.834
I'm fine.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.600
Two weeks. Okay?

03:33.734 --> 03:35.166
Okay.
Okay.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.500
I don't get it, you've taught
at five different universities.

04:07.633 --> 04:09.800
Sure, places that are smaller,

04:09.934 --> 04:12.367
and where your teaching ability
matters more

04:12.500 --> 04:14.300
than how many books
I haven't published.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.700
Yes, but you served on the
faculty committee at this one.

04:16.834 --> 04:19.133
And you organized that week-long
reading retreat last year,

04:19.266 --> 04:21.166
which was incredible,
by the way.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.367
I wish that mattered, Gwen,
but you know the saying.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.700
It's publish or perish.

04:24.834 --> 04:26.667
That mentality
is too intense for me.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.667
That's why I love being a librarian.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.667
The most pressure I face
is collecting late fees.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.033
Which you are horrible at.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.533
I know, I'm a real softy.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.066
Ugh, I just wish I knew how to
get out of my head about this.

04:40.533 --> 04:43.333
Actually, um,

04:43.467 --> 04:45.400
I've been carrying this
around all week

04:45.533 --> 04:48.533
just waiting for the right time
to give it to you.

04:48.667 --> 04:49.800
What's this?

04:49.934 --> 04:52.533
It's a present.
From your mom.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.333
When was this?

04:54.467 --> 04:57.033
About a year ago, when her
health started taking a turn.

04:57.166 --> 05:01.033
You know Carol, always putting
everyone else first.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.433
Open it.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.433
She gave me specific
instructions to give this to you

05:17.567 --> 05:19.400
two weeks before your 35th birthday.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.467
Cornwall...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.967
It's my job to make sure you go.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.467
This was the year I promised
we would finally

05:26.600 --> 05:29.100
go visit her family farm,
the one that she grew up on.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.533
She wanted to show me
the literary festival.

05:32.667 --> 05:36.667
She thought of everything.
Airfare, taxi, train fare.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.767
This ticket is for Monday.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.133
Better start packing.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.867
I can't just pick up
and go to England.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.433
What better place to write a
paper about English poets

05:44.567 --> 05:45.700
than England?

05:45.834 --> 05:47.300
What do I tell the dean?

05:47.433 --> 05:50.266
You could come up with a million
reasons not to do this,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.734
but you made her a promise.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.600
You've barely done anything
for yourself

05:54.734 --> 05:55.867
since she passed away.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.734
She wanted this for you.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.233
What if something happens?

05:59.367 --> 06:01.300
Like what? Killer sheep?

06:01.433 --> 06:02.800
You know what I mean.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.300
What if my anxiety gets really
bad over there?

06:05.433 --> 06:07.500
Then you use the techniques
your doctor gave you.

06:07.633 --> 06:11.767
In the meantime, eat right,
exercise, and take your meds.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.533
You can call me anytime
you want.

06:14.667 --> 06:15.967
In fact, you should
call me often

06:16.100 --> 06:19.133
so I can live vicariously
through you.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.700
Go, Joss.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.734
You need this.

06:29.734 --> 06:33.867
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

06:34.900 --> 06:39.367
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

06:40.400 --> 06:45.066
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

06:46.100 --> 06:50.467
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

07:05.967 --> 07:07.600
Tegan, love, I think the
chickens have had

07:07.734 --> 07:09.700
quite enough breakfast
for the moment.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.800
They're looking quite plump
as it is, sweetheart.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.266
Tegan?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.333
Penny for your thoughts?

07:20.467 --> 07:22.500
I just don't know why they're
making us read our poems

07:22.633 --> 07:24.000
at the festival.

07:24.133 --> 07:26.266
Because you've been
working hard on them,

07:26.400 --> 07:29.033
and letting the kids read one of
their poems at the festival

07:29.166 --> 07:30.333
is a tradition.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.834
We're not even done
with them yet.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.000
What if I don't finish?
What if I mess up?

07:34.133 --> 07:35.767
Hey.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.934
That's the beauty
of creative writing.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.600
You can't go wrong, 'cause
anything you say is original.

07:40.734 --> 07:41.867
Okay?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.333
Okay.
Yeah?

07:44.467 --> 07:45.700
Come one.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.867
Oh.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.266
There we go.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.100
Right. Now nip inside,
grab your backpack

07:52.233 --> 07:54.266
before Gran realizes we haven't
left yet, all right?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.900
Oi! Forgetting something,
are we?

07:57.033 --> 07:58.467
Good girl, okay.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.734
Thanks, Gran.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.567
Glad I could be of service.
You two should be long gone.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.500
It's my fault,
I was feeding the chickens.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.834
It was my fault, I was stripping
the bed in the guest cottage.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.667
Just trying to keep on top
of the bookings.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.333
You're trying to drive me mad
is what you're doing.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.734
I already changed them.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.266
Right, well then.
Just making double sure.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.967
I don't know why I bother.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.500
If that next booking
ever turns up, I'll be amazed.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.934
They reserved it nearly a year
ago and never confirmed.

08:24.066 --> 08:25.600
At least they paid in full.

08:25.734 --> 08:28.567
How you got me playing
chambermaid, I shall never know.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.934
I think it rather suits you.

08:30.066 --> 08:31.433
Oh, I'm sure you're
tickled pink.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.633
Now it's your turn to play chauffeur

08:33.767 --> 08:36.400
and get this little princess
to school.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.400
Right, come on, you.
With pleasure.

08:41.233 --> 08:42.700
Your grace.

08:43.734 --> 08:44.900
Your lordship.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.166
Good boy.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.467
Hey!

09:11.600 --> 09:13.000
You okay?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.700
You were looking the wrong way.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.567
Wish I could say it was the
first time it's happened here.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.000
You all right?

09:23.133 --> 09:24.767
Yeah.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.000
Can I have my arm back?

09:29.266 --> 09:30.867
Of course, I'm sorry.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.300
Uh...

09:33.433 --> 09:35.233
Oh, I can help you with that.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.567
Are you my driver?

09:36.700 --> 09:38.200
Only if you're Jocelyn Lambert.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.967
Everyone calls me Joss,
but yes,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.200
yes, that's me.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.700
Welcome to Cornwall.
I'm Daniel.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.166
What are you
smuggling in here?

09:56.300 --> 09:57.500
Books.
Books?

09:57.633 --> 09:59.800
We've got libraries full
of them here.

09:59.934 --> 10:03.300
Actually, we're quite well-known
for our written word.

10:03.433 --> 10:06.033
All right, party is over.
In the back with you.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.700
Come on, Samson, in the back.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.467
It's okay,
I can sit in the back.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.367
He's just being stubborn.
He'll get there.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.033
Oh, come on, Samson.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.567
I prefer it, actually.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.900
Real classy, mate.

10:29.767 --> 10:34.433
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

10:35.467 --> 10:38.734
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

10:38.867 --> 10:42.400
Direct route or scenic?

10:42.533 --> 10:43.867
I'll let you choose.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.066
Oh, it's a no-brainer for me.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.200
Is it ready?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.934
Patience, my lovely.
You have to let it brew.

11:21.066 --> 11:23.033
Why don't you use a teabag
like dad?

11:23.166 --> 11:26.700
Because ladies use loose leaf,
like the queen.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.800
Daddy just presses on the bag
with a spoon.

11:28.934 --> 11:30.400
So does Tarzan, I suppose.

11:30.533 --> 11:31.934
But if you want to do it properly,

11:32.066 --> 11:33.433
you'll do it as I've shown you.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.967
Now you always
put the milk in first.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.767
Before you fill the teacup.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.100
Not everything can be done
on a whim

11:42.233 --> 11:44.300
no matter what your father
tells you.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.266
What about jam and clotted
cream?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.934
Jam first, of course.

11:49.934 --> 11:51.867
Felix!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.567
Just finish your scone.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.967
Hello, Felix.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.867
Mrs. Carter.
You're looking lovely today.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.834
May I ask why
you're disturbing my sheep?

12:07.967 --> 12:09.266
I take it Danny failed
to mention

12:09.400 --> 12:10.834
that I would be
stopping by today.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.300
He most certainly did.

12:12.433 --> 12:13.700
Brilliant.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.533
If it's about those monstrosities,

12:16.667 --> 12:19.133
you can save your breath
and my time.

12:19.266 --> 12:22.000
They're wind turbines,
Mrs. Carter, not Voldemort.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.667
It's all right to speak of them.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.700
Oh, I know what they are, Felix.
I just don't want them.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.500
Well, shall we go in for a cuppa

12:29.633 --> 12:31.166
and have one of your famous
scones?

12:31.300 --> 12:33.867
I don't remember inviting you
to tea and scones.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.433
Come on, look,

12:35.567 --> 12:37.100
she's holding them up in the
window, isn't she?

12:37.233 --> 12:39.500
Merryn:
That's my granddaughter.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.033
She's having scones.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.500
Felix:
Here's Danny now.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.233
Do you want to tell me
what this is all about?

13:02.667 --> 13:05.000
Oh, hi, I'm sorry,
I'm Joss.

13:05.133 --> 13:06.734
I'm staying at the cottage.

13:06.867 --> 13:10.033
Well, that's lovely dear,
but I'm not talking to you.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.433
I'm talking to that
driver of yours.

13:12.567 --> 13:15.734
I asked Felix to come by
to explain our options.

13:15.867 --> 13:18.166
It's a great opportunity
in a growing industry.

13:18.300 --> 13:21.533
We have an industry, sheep.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.767
You've already turned my
mill house into a cheap motel.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.433
Forgive me if I don't want the
rest of the farm

13:27.567 --> 13:29.800
looking like an Orwell novel.

13:34.533 --> 13:38.166
I'm sorry about my mother,
she's in one of her moods.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.400
I take it you didn't
talk to her, then.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.000
I was working up to it.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.600
You're not just my driver,
are you?

13:43.734 --> 13:45.233
I wear many hats.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.233
Too many, if you ask me.
Right, I'll be off.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.934
It was lovely to meet you, miss.
Hope you have a pleasant stay.

13:51.066 --> 13:53.367
And give me a buzz.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.934
Excuse me for not introducing
myself properly.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.400
I'm Daniel Carter.

13:57.533 --> 13:58.867
Some say I run the farm
around here.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.500
I say the farm runs me.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.033
Right this way.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.100
So you have your own washing
machine downstairs.

14:14.233 --> 14:17.333
That's great. Do you have a
printer, by chance?

14:17.467 --> 14:20.233
Uh, no, not here,
but we have one in the house,

14:20.367 --> 14:22.567
so just knock
and you can use it anytime.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.133
Uh, which is also where
breakfast is served,

14:24.266 --> 14:26.600
usually by my mother.
Oh, okay.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.066
I know she comes off
a bit gruff,

14:28.200 --> 14:29.667
she doesn't mean anything by it.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.166
I did appreciate the Orwell
reference, though.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.467
Yeah, she's very well-read,

14:33.600 --> 14:35.667
but sharp minds have sharp tongues.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.100
Consider yourself warned.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.300
Well, I'm sure your knackered,
so I'll let you settle in.

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
Oh, and if you need
- the Wi-
- Fi code,

14:47.934 --> 14:50.800
it's in the guest book
under my mobile number.

14:50.934 --> 14:52.734
If you have any questions,
best to ask me.

14:52.867 --> 14:55.100
Oh, and if you want to stretch
your legs,

14:55.233 --> 14:56.900
the sea is up and over
the hill a bit.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.767
You can't miss it.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.233
Thank you.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.867
"Flopsy and Mopsy and Cottontail

15:20.000 --> 15:22.500
"had bread and milk
and blackberries for supper."

15:22.633 --> 15:25.533
"The end."

15:25.667 --> 15:27.900
So, do you want to tell me about
your day now?

15:28.033 --> 15:30.066
It was fine, dad.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.567
Fine? That's all I get.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.166
Okay then.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.867
Well, you should get to sleep.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.066
So, good night, good night,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.567
mind the bedbugs don't bite.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.367
Ahh!
Dad, stop!

15:44.500 --> 15:46.300
Okay, okay. Suit yourself.

15:46.433 --> 15:47.667
I love you.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
I love you too.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.734
What if something happens?

16:22.367 --> 16:24.000
They're giving you two weeks
to resubmit.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.834
Okay, Mom.

16:31.433 --> 16:33.266
I'm here.

16:35.433 --> 16:36.834
Now what?

16:51.667 --> 16:53.767
Daniel:
Felix is coming by today.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.967
I thought we'd settled
that matter.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.600
We're just having a coffee.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.767
Good. Try to keep your grand
ideas to a minimum.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.333
I'm trying to put my business
degree to work out here.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.333
You traded in livestock futures.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.867
And what's that supposed
to mean, exactly?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.500
You were hardly the Wolf of Wall
Street, were you?

17:10.633 --> 17:12.867
More like the sheep of Southampton.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.867
I can still hear you.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
All I'm saying is the country
suits you.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.100
Hi there, buddy!

17:32.233 --> 17:33.667
Sampson, no!

17:33.800 --> 17:35.934
Oh, it's okay,
we've met.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.767
But I haven't met you yet.
I'm Joss.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.300
I'm Tegan.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.133
Dad says I'm not supposed to
bother the guests.

17:42.266 --> 17:43.800
Oh, you're not bothering me.

17:43.934 --> 17:46.367
Tell me, Tegan, has he ever
eaten your homework?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.867
No.
No?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.367
Well, maybe he could eat mine.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.800
You have homework?

17:51.934 --> 17:54.500
Sort of, I'm just writing a
research paper,

17:54.633 --> 17:56.700
which is proving trickier
than I thought.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.633
I find writing tricky, too.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.166
Is it?

18:00.300 --> 18:01.900
Sometimes.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.700
Well, I'm a teacher, so if you
ever have any questions

18:03.834 --> 18:06.400
or you need any help,
feel free to ask, okay?

18:06.533 --> 18:07.900
Thanks!

18:08.033 --> 18:09.400
As long as it's okay
with your mom and dad.

18:09.533 --> 18:12.000
It's just my Dad.
Well, and Gran, of course.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.533
Okay, well, make sure you ask
her too, yeah?

18:15.667 --> 18:17.000
Are you afraid of her?

18:17.133 --> 18:18.934
What, of your Gran?

18:19.066 --> 18:21.867
It's quite all right.
My friend Lily is afraid, too.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.567
But she's really lovely to me.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.433
I'm sure she is.

18:25.567 --> 18:26.934
First bell is in 15,
are you ready?

18:27.066 --> 18:28.867
Yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.700
Ah.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.567
How'd you sleep?

18:32.700 --> 18:34.533
Okay.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.000
That doesn't sound very convincing.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.934
Oh, sorry, no,

18:38.066 --> 18:40.266
I can't even blame it
on the jetlag.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.700
I'm just not a great sleeper.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.367
It has nothing to do with
the cottage.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.834
Maybe the fresh air will help
with that.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.433
Any plans?

18:46.567 --> 18:49.767
No, I just have this research
paper to work on.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.033
You flew all this way to work?

18:51.166 --> 18:53.233
Big deadline coming up.

18:53.367 --> 18:54.700
Daniel:
Well, good luck.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.367
Thank you.
Come on, you.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.467
Your turn to drive, Teeg.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.734
Tegan:

19:01.867 --> 19:03.667
Yeah! No, no.
Not really.

19:52.767 --> 19:53.967
and she said,
"You're not invited!"

19:54.100 --> 19:55.467
No...
Yeah!

19:55.600 --> 19:57.300
I mean, I've jumped that fence
1,000 times.

19:57.433 --> 19:59.667
Who knew that this was going to
be the final straw, eh?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.166
Where is she, anyway?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.800
Out with her precious sheep.

20:02.934 --> 20:05.000
Ah, great, so we can talk
more freely.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.400
Every month, it gets more strained.

20:07.533 --> 20:09.066
Every suggestion I make,
she hates.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.567
I thought she would have been
thrilled to see you

20:10.700 --> 20:11.800
and Tegan at the farm.

20:11.934 --> 20:13.467
Tegan, yeah, but she treats me

20:13.600 --> 20:15.266
like the Spanish invading Cornwall.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.500
I mean, a little warning would
have been nice.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.000
Ah, come on, you know my mum.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.567
I do, she acts tough,
but we both know

20:21.700 --> 20:23.300
that I've been her favorite
since primary school.

20:23.433 --> 20:24.934
Debatable.
Come on!

20:26.900 --> 20:30.266
Look, I'm sorry, but all these
half measures you're doing

20:30.400 --> 20:33.100
to try to diversify
the farm, well,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.266
we know they're not going to
make much difference, are they?

20:35.400 --> 20:38.600
This... this is your long-term.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.000
What, leasing my land to you?

20:40.133 --> 20:43.467
Not me. These beauties.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.266
I mean, she does have a point,
they do look rather dystopian.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.967
More science fiction,
if you ask me.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.133
Don't look at me like that.

20:51.266 --> 20:52.767
It was your idea
in the first place.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.934
I know. But I also know
what she's going to say.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.233
That we're sheep farmers,
that's who we are,

20:57.367 --> 20:59.500
that's who we've always been.
And that they're going to ruin

20:59.633 --> 21:01.233
the landscape she built
with my father.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.033
Not totally.
No, not totally.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.867
I just need to find
the right time.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
All right, well, they're not
gonna wait around much longer.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.367
They'll simply just offer
the contract to someone else.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.700
So can I check in next week?

21:11.834 --> 21:14.033
Yeah.
Right.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.300
Am I going to see you at
Harbor's Head this weekend?

21:16.433 --> 21:19.000
Two o'clock? Lily is requesting
Tegan's presence.

21:19.133 --> 21:21.200
No, I've got so much work
to do on the farm.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.567
We'll be there.

Not much, he hasn't lifted a paw

Wow.

23:15.166 --> 23:16.934
Quite the wall.

23:17.066 --> 23:18.367
Oh, it's built the Cornish way.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.700
You put mud between the stones

23:20.834 --> 23:22.734
so the plants can grow
between them.

23:22.867 --> 23:24.533
Fascinating.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.367
And very tedious.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.867
I've been at it a year and still
haven't fixed half the problems.

my research paper.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.900
A bit mucked up, then?

23:33.033 --> 23:34.734
So what brings you out here?

23:34.867 --> 23:37.266
Just stretching my legs, ruminating.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.800
Procrastinating.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.700
Do you want a hand?

23:43.367 --> 23:46.367
I'd rather build a wall
than bang my head against one.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.834
All right,
but you will get dirty.

23:49.967 --> 23:53.667
It's okay,
my B&B has a laundry machine.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.533
Posh.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.433
Here.

23:57.567 --> 23:58.700
And you use this.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.200
Oh, thanks,

24:03.233 --> 24:07.233
So, you're a literature
professor?

24:07.367 --> 24:09.133
What got you into that?

24:09.266 --> 24:12.600
Well, my Mom and my grandparents
introduced me to the classics

24:12.734 --> 24:15.600
when I was, well,
probably Tegan's age.

24:15.734 --> 24:19.233
Is that why you bring all
your books with you?

24:19.367 --> 24:22.000
Ah, it's for my research
on Wordsworth.

24:22.133 --> 24:23.266
Oh, the footballer.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.000
The poet. He's English.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.467
Don't tell me you haven't
heard of him.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.066
Of course I've heard of him.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.633
"Nature never did betray
the heart that loved her."

24:32.767 --> 24:33.900
Mick Jagger.

24:34.033 --> 24:35.467
Oh, stop it.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.133
Ah.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.834
So, um,

24:40.967 --> 24:42.400
why here?

24:42.533 --> 24:45.233
Why, on this whole island,
you chose this bit?

24:45.367 --> 24:46.967
This farm?

24:47.100 --> 24:49.934
Because this is where
my mom grew up.

24:50.066 --> 24:51.667
You're kidding.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.800
No, believe it or not,
my grandparents,

24:54.934 --> 24:56.433
Pat and Colin Penberthy,

24:56.567 --> 24:58.667
are the ones who sold the farm
to your parents.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.166
That's fascinating.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.400
We always wanted to come here,
my Mom and I.

25:03.533 --> 25:04.867
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.333
We planned on it, um,
but time just...

25:10.767 --> 25:12.033
Ran out.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.000
She passed away last year.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.633
I'm so sorry.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.166
Me too.

25:22.500 --> 25:27.300
You know, having grown up
here myself,

25:27.433 --> 25:30.400
I can say she was a lucky woman.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.433
It's a beautiful place.

25:37.467 --> 25:39.066
Have you been here
your whole life?

25:39.200 --> 25:42.200
No, I went to uni in London.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.867
I did my master's in business.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Actually, I used to work
in global markets.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.800
Futures, mainly.

25:48.934 --> 25:51.300
And you gave all of that up to
come back and work on the land?

25:51.433 --> 25:53.000
How romantic of you.

25:53.133 --> 25:57.967
No, I came back to help my Mum
sort things out.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.533
She won't admit it, but she's
older than she thinks.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.934
And, um, yeah.

26:04.066 --> 26:06.400
Unfortunately, it's more work
than even I can handle.

26:06.533 --> 26:09.133
Well, we should get busy then.

26:12.266 --> 26:15.433
Hey, Gwen,
sorry I missed your call again.

26:15.567 --> 26:18.567
I was out building a rock wall.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.567
I will tell you about it
when we connect,

26:20.700 --> 26:23.934
but until then, tag, you're it.
Okay, bye.

26:24.066 --> 26:26.133
Hi. Is everything okay?

26:26.266 --> 26:30.533
Gran said I have to do some
homework before training today,

26:30.667 --> 26:34.033
and I still might need a little
bit of help if that's okay.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.600
Of course.

26:35.734 --> 26:38.133
It's just a silly short poem,
but every year,

26:38.266 --> 26:40.133
they make the year two kids read
them at the festival.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.767
Mm-hm.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.767
Have you gotten any feedback yet
from your teacher?

26:43.900 --> 26:47.533
We have to read in front
of the class, so no, not yet.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.066
I asked to go last.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.867
Well, I would be happy
to take a look.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.233
I haven't gotten very far.

26:53.367 --> 26:54.767
That's okay.

26:56.767 --> 26:58.533
But so far, is it right?

26:58.667 --> 27:00.767
There's no right or wrong
in creative writing.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.800
That's what my dad says.

27:02.934 --> 27:04.900
Well, I agree.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.000
Have you tried mind-mapping?

27:11.133 --> 27:12.633
I don't know what that is.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.367
It's a really useful tool,

27:14.500 --> 27:15.800
and I would be so happy
to show you.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.667
Okay.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.867
But I've got to go to training
now, so maybe tomorrow?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I'll be here all day, so anytime.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.300
Thank you.

27:25.433 --> 27:27.033
Bye.
Bye.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.300
Hi, Lily!

28:06.700 --> 28:08.667
Using the family door now,
are we?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.600
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't--

28:11.734 --> 28:13.033
No, no, no, don't worry.

28:13.166 --> 28:16.166
You are technically our guest,
I suppose.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.000
How can I be of service?

28:18.133 --> 28:19.834
Sorry.

28:19.967 --> 28:22.367
Um, thank you, Mrs. Carter.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.367
Is Daniel back from the field?

28:27.500 --> 28:30.600
That boy does what he likes
when he likes.

28:30.734 --> 28:32.367
May I ask why?

28:32.500 --> 28:35.100
I, uh, have a question for him.

28:35.233 --> 28:36.667
Is this about your
accommodation?

28:36.800 --> 28:39.600
I told him people would expect
a fancy resort.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.567
Not a drafty old mill room.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.834
No, it's actually--
it's about Tegan.

28:43.967 --> 28:46.033
You have a question about
my granddaughter?

28:47.467 --> 28:50.533
No, not exactly, I...

28:50.667 --> 28:51.900
Uh...

28:53.333 --> 28:55.500
I found her notebook.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.000
Thank you. Yeah.

28:57.133 --> 28:59.233
I'm sure she'll be quite pleased.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.567
Is that all?

29:01.700 --> 29:03.300
Oh, that's all, yes.

29:03.433 --> 29:04.600
Very well.

29:04.734 --> 29:05.967
Okay.

30:03.467 --> 30:05.367
Joss:
Daniel?

30:05.500 --> 30:07.633
Daniel! Good morning.

30:07.767 --> 30:09.567
Wasn't expecting to see you out
this early morning.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.633
Doing some early morning
procrastination?

30:13.333 --> 30:15.667
I actually wanted
to ask you something.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.066
Has Tegan been struggling with
reading and writing for awhile?

30:19.200 --> 30:20.900
What makes you say that?

30:21.033 --> 30:22.633
She asked me for some help
with a poem.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.166
She shouldn't have been
bothering you, I'm sorry.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.166
Oh, no, I offered.
But I noticed her notebook,

30:27.300 --> 30:28.800
and I saw something that
concerned me.

30:28.934 --> 30:30.333
Concerned you how?

30:30.467 --> 30:33.500
I think she may be showing signs
of dyslexia.

30:33.633 --> 30:37.066
Has her teacher mentioned
anything?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.700
Uh, just that she might need
some extra help reading.

30:39.834 --> 30:42.200
Um... she's had a tough time
with the move,

30:42.333 --> 30:44.800
she's fallen behind
a little bit.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.734
She's had to put up with more
than her fair share in life,

30:46.867 --> 30:49.800
but she's smart,
she makes great art.

30:49.934 --> 30:52.700
That makes sense, 'cause most
people with dyslexia,

30:52.834 --> 30:54.200
they're highly intelligent.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.066
Because they excel in
other areas,

30:56.200 --> 30:57.867
it can be really hard to spot.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.500
My Mom had it.

30:59.633 --> 31:01.066
She struggled a lot
when she was a kid,

31:01.200 --> 31:03.166
but she learned how
to manage it.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.033
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your mother,

31:07.166 --> 31:08.900
but I think you're making
a bit of a leap here.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.567
I know this is overwhelming,

31:10.700 --> 31:13.233
but there's people who
specialize in this.

31:13.367 --> 31:16.300
And I would also be happy
to help.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.667
Uh, thanks, but we're sorted.

31:21.934 --> 31:23.400
Samson, come here.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.266
Come on.
Come on, you.

31:39.567 --> 31:41.367
That's beautiful, Tegan.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.934
What's it called?

31:43.066 --> 31:45.200
It's called Sampson the Mighty.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.533
Perfect.

31:47.667 --> 31:50.633
Why don't you write it up here
at the top?

31:53.700 --> 31:56.567
Well, it's you're choice,

31:56.700 --> 31:58.633
you're the artist.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.467
Be back in a mo'.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.133
Well, what do you think?

32:18.266 --> 32:23.066
I think the professor is poking
her nose in where she shouldn't.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.200
What if she's right?

32:26.333 --> 32:28.800
Maybe I should take her to the
doctor to at least rule it out.

32:28.934 --> 32:30.967
Oh, this is the last thing
she needs.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.367
What is that supposed to mean?

32:32.500 --> 32:35.633
She's already drawn
a short straw.

32:35.767 --> 32:38.467
What kind of mother leaves
her child?

32:38.600 --> 32:40.767
I warned you about Catherine,
from very the beginning,

32:40.900 --> 32:42.967
that she was no good for you,
But you wouldn't listen.

32:43.100 --> 32:46.900
Do you want to rehash my failed
marriage or talk about Tegan?

33:10.700 --> 33:12.066
We're going to
tuck in Polly,

33:12.200 --> 33:13.700
and we're going to
tuck in Laney,

33:13.834 --> 33:15.333
and we're going to
tuck in Dougie.

33:15.467 --> 33:16.567
Good night,
good night, good night!

33:16.700 --> 33:18.567
And you. There we go.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.767
Hey.

33:20.900 --> 33:24.000
Why didn't you tell me
that you were struggling?

33:24.133 --> 33:26.433
I didn't want you to worry.

33:26.567 --> 33:28.100
I'm not worried.

33:28.233 --> 33:30.000
Is this the face of
a worried man?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.433
Hmm?

33:32.700 --> 33:34.266
You know you can tell me anything.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.333
We're a team, right?

33:36.467 --> 33:38.266
Okay, Dad.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.133
Is Joss going to help me
with my poem?

33:42.900 --> 33:45.066
Uh, Joss is a guest so we
shouldn't be bothering her.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.266
But I'm going to talk
to your teacher

33:47.400 --> 33:49.367
and we're going to get
everything sorted out at school.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.934
Make a plan, yeah?

33:51.066 --> 33:54.867
Okay. I just like talking
to her, she's nice.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.700
Yeah, she is nice.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.834
Um, sleep tight.

34:00.967 --> 34:02.166
Don't tickle me!

34:02.300 --> 34:03.700
I wouldn't dare.

34:05.734 --> 34:07.533
Okay. Ah.

34:09.734 --> 34:11.033
Does it go away?

34:13.133 --> 34:15.066
Does what? Dyslexia?

34:19.033 --> 34:20.400
No, it doesn't go away,

34:20.533 --> 34:22.133
but there's loads that we can do

34:22.266 --> 34:24.400
to make sure it gets
a lot better, all right?

34:24.533 --> 34:26.066
Okay.

34:26.200 --> 34:29.000
Yeah. I love you.

34:29.133 --> 34:31.066
I love you too.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.934
Tegan hasn't made many
connections since we got here.

35:04.967 --> 35:06.867
But she really likes you.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.200
You know, I don't know
what we're dealing with exactly,

35:11.333 --> 35:15.233
but... I want to help
however we can.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.900
So, if your offer still stands?

35:24.300 --> 35:25.667
Of course.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.900
Goodnight, then.

35:32.033 --> 35:33.266
Goodnight.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.133
I love what you're saying here.

35:46.266 --> 35:47.467
About the river?

35:47.600 --> 35:48.934
Yeah, about how
it makes you happy.

35:49.066 --> 35:50.467
Do you want to try
reading the mind map,

35:50.600 --> 35:52.767
see how it sounds to you?
Let's start here, okay?

35:52.900 --> 35:56.533
I ran to the river.

35:56.667 --> 35:58.266
Good, good. Keep going.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.767
I can't remember
what comes next.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.300
Well, whatever you want
to be next is next.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.900
Do you know what I do
when I get stuck?

36:11.600 --> 36:14.266
I sing.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.367
Okay, not well.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.500
But it helps me find
the rhythm in the words,

36:18.633 --> 36:20.433
so I try to sing the poems,

36:20.567 --> 36:22.166
and sometimes...

36:23.734 --> 36:24.834
I dance them.

36:24.967 --> 36:26.533
Are you serious?

36:26.667 --> 36:29.433
Yeah, of course, it helps
the words just flow out of you.

36:29.567 --> 36:31.500
Do you want to see?

36:31.633 --> 36:34.066
Okay. I'll do it,
but just for you. Ready?

Writing doesn't have
to all be hard work.

37:19.533 --> 37:21.333
It should be fun, too.

37:21.467 --> 37:23.367
Danny:
Says the woman who would
rather mend a granite wall

37:23.500 --> 37:25.667
than write her paper.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.333
Sorry, I didn't mean
to break it up.

37:28.467 --> 37:30.533
Oh, no. That's alright I think
we're almost done for the day.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.166
Don't you think, Tegan?

37:32.300 --> 37:35.834
Besides, I should get back
to writing my own paper.

37:35.967 --> 37:38.066
I'm still quite stuck actually.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.600
Did you try dancing?

37:39.734 --> 37:41.200
You know, I'm not sure
that would work for

37:41.333 --> 37:44.166
the research paper,
but I should try it, huh?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.567
What you need is a pasty.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.400
Yes!

37:47.533 --> 37:48.834
Actually, Felix and his wife
Isabelle are taking

37:48.967 --> 37:50.433
their daughter Lily
to the harbor head,

37:50.567 --> 37:51.934
and the puppet show.
We're gonna get pasties after.

37:52.066 --> 37:53.300
You should come along.

37:55.367 --> 37:56.500
Yes! You must.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.233
I really shouldn't.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.900
But maybe a change of
scenery would do me good.

38:04.033 --> 38:05.467
I would only stay
for an hour, though.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.500
We'll take it.

38:06.633 --> 38:08.767
Alright.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.266
Okay, but what is a pasty?

38:11.400 --> 38:12.700
Oh, well, let me tell you.

38:29.300 --> 38:32.433
Behind you! Behind you!

38:47.100 --> 38:48.734
Felix:
Lovely to see you again, Joss.

38:48.867 --> 38:50.333
How are you enjoying Cornwall?

38:50.467 --> 38:52.333
It's beautiful so far from
what I've seen at least.

38:52.467 --> 38:53.734
Surviving Mrs. Carter I presume?

38:53.867 --> 38:55.433
Easy!

38:55.567 --> 38:56.667
Fell free to ignore him.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.967
I'm Isabelle.
Oh, hi.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.734
Felix's incredibly
tolerant wife.

38:59.867 --> 39:01.567
Nice to meet you.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.467
Isabelle runs the marketing
for the literary festival.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.300
Oh, let's hope
you've heard of it.

39:05.433 --> 39:08.567
Of course, my mom grew up here,
she used to go to it as a child.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.133
Is that so?

39:10.266 --> 39:11.367
Yeah, she even
volunteered for the festival

39:11.500 --> 39:12.467
when she was in her 20s.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.066
Did she ever submit?

39:14.200 --> 39:15.533
Not original work.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.800
She wasn't much of
a writer herself,

39:16.934 --> 39:18.900
but she did
memorize all the greats

39:19.033 --> 39:21.300
and she would recite one
at the final event.

39:21.433 --> 39:23.834
Oh, how lovely.
What's her name?

39:23.967 --> 39:25.400
I bet my mother
will remember her.

39:25.533 --> 39:26.867
She remembers everything else.
Oh, shush.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.066
Carol Lambert.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.567
Well, Carol Penberthy
was her maiden name.

39:30.700 --> 39:34.000
That sounds familiar,
but I'll ask her.

39:34.133 --> 39:36.367
Joss is a professor
of romantic literature.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.633
So, connection.

39:37.767 --> 39:39.633
That's brilliant.
Romantic eh?

39:39.767 --> 39:42.667
Danny boy over here is
a hopeless romantic himself.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.400
Aren't you?
That so?

39:46.133 --> 39:47.700
I never answer such
questions on an empty tummy.

39:47.834 --> 39:50.300
Well, Ashton's mum is
taking the girls for ice cream.

39:50.433 --> 39:52.667
Right, well, that just
means one thing, doesn't it?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.233
To the pub. Come on.

39:56.266 --> 40:00.233
How do they even think of this?
This is, like, genius.

40:00.367 --> 40:02.000
The tin miners used to take
this down the mines with them,

40:02.133 --> 40:03.233
and they would
never eat the crusts

40:03.367 --> 40:04.800
because their hands were dirty.

40:04.934 --> 40:06.200
I never knew that.
Is that real?

40:06.333 --> 40:07.567
So what's the verdict?

40:07.700 --> 40:09.233
Traditional or veg?

40:09.367 --> 40:10.667
Traditional, definitely.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.700
Danny:
All your meat
and veg in one bite.

40:11.834 --> 40:13.433
How can you go wrong?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.200
Hey, are we still on for Monday?

40:17.333 --> 40:18.867
Danny:
The surveyor? Yeah.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.400
Must we talk business?
We're having such a good time.

40:21.533 --> 40:23.333
You don't have to decide yet,
but we will need to know how

40:23.467 --> 40:25.066
much, you know,
land you'll have to swap out

40:25.200 --> 40:27.166
if you decide to go that way.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.166
Who wants another beer?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.567
Yeah.
I will, yeah.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.033
I should actually, um--
I should get going.

40:31.166 --> 40:32.700
I've just--
I've slacked off enough.

40:32.834 --> 40:33.967
Yeah, we can go.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.834
Oh, no. That's okay. You stay.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.867
Have fun. I can walk by myself.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.300
Just point me in
the right direction.

40:39.433 --> 40:42.133
Okay, em, we came
the more direct route.

40:42.266 --> 40:43.567
If you want
a more scenic version,

40:43.700 --> 40:46.400
then just turn left,
and you can't miss it.

40:46.533 --> 40:48.867
It's very easy to do.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.333
Okay. Thank you.

40:52.467 --> 40:53.367
Bye.
Bye.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.400
Hey, Joss.

40:55.533 --> 40:59.633
Um... Thank you
for today with Tegan.

40:59.767 --> 41:02.600
Of course.
We can do more, too.

41:02.734 --> 41:03.600
You sure you don't want to stay?

41:03.734 --> 41:05.066
Next round's on Felix.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.767
I think I should just get back.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.033
Right.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.200
Or left, it's prettier.

41:23.567 --> 41:26.767
Gwen:
It looks like there's four
candidates in the running now.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.400
Four, how am I supposed
to compete with four?

41:30.533 --> 41:33.633
I didn't mean to worry you,
I just thought you should know.

41:33.767 --> 41:35.233
What am I going to do?

41:35.367 --> 41:37.066
I only have a week to
make this what they want.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.300
The paper?

41:38.433 --> 41:40.400
Your research is impeccable.

41:40.533 --> 41:42.300
I'm sure it just
needs a good edit.

41:42.433 --> 41:43.600
You'll figure it out.

41:43.734 --> 41:45.734
But what if I don't?
What if I can't?

41:45.867 --> 41:48.367
Joss, I know how much
this means to you,

41:48.500 --> 41:51.233
and, honestly,
you're the best teacher I have.

41:51.367 --> 41:53.200
I don't want to lose you.

41:53.333 --> 41:56.767
One step at a time.
Get the paper in.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.867
When you get back,
we'll talk about what else

41:59.000 --> 42:02.934
you can do to
impress the board, okay?

42:03.066 --> 42:04.934
Okay.

42:05.066 --> 42:06.166
We'll talk soon.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.467
This will pass.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.400
"And in life's noisiest hour,
there whispers still

43:03.533 --> 43:05.400
the ceaseless love of thee,

43:05.533 --> 43:08.033
the heart's self-solace
and soliloquy."

43:35.433 --> 43:36.800
Promise you. Alex.
Best surveyor in the country.

43:36.934 --> 43:38.066
So, what does he think?

43:38.200 --> 43:40.166
A good 40%, at least.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.166
You know, to allow for
the number of wind turbines

43:42.300 --> 43:45.066
to satisfy the contract,
but once they're in...

43:45.200 --> 43:46.333
They take care of themselves?

43:46.467 --> 43:48.333
Guaranteed income.

43:48.467 --> 43:49.967
As long as the wind blows,

43:50.100 --> 43:52.600
and in Cornwall,
she always blows.

43:52.734 --> 43:53.834
Alright, so what else
do you need from me?

43:53.967 --> 43:56.700
Nothing much, just an answer.

43:58.233 --> 44:00.333
End of week?

44:00.467 --> 44:01.700
Yeah.

44:03.667 --> 44:06.133
Alex!

44:06.266 --> 44:08.000
Looks like
you're already coming, great.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.333
How you been standing there?

44:15.467 --> 44:17.233
Long enough.

44:17.367 --> 44:19.000
Mum! Let's talk about this.

44:19.133 --> 44:21.367
Why? You seem to have made up
your mind for both of us.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.834
We agreed that
I would take over the farm.

44:22.967 --> 44:25.333
To preserve it,
not carve it up.

44:25.467 --> 44:26.734
You don't understand
what I'm dealing with.

44:26.867 --> 44:28.533
If it's too much for you,
hire some hands.

44:28.667 --> 44:30.467
It's not that simple.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.867
The markets are changing.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.333
England is changing,
the whole world in fact.

44:33.467 --> 44:35.700
We can't keep
holding on to the past.

44:35.834 --> 44:37.567
I agreed to
the bed and breakfast.

44:37.700 --> 44:38.700
Isn't that enough for you?

44:38.834 --> 44:40.533
No.

44:40.667 --> 44:42.900
I'm doing everything I can.

44:43.033 --> 44:45.867
I promise you,
I won't make a final decision

44:46.000 --> 44:47.133
without your approval.

44:47.266 --> 44:49.066
Good.

44:51.367 --> 44:54.000
I'm going to the cove.
Will you watch Tegan?

45:13.767 --> 45:15.133
Be right there.

45:19.266 --> 45:20.433
Are you busy at the moment?

45:20.567 --> 45:21.967
No. Not at the minute, no.

45:22.100 --> 45:23.367
Come on a drive with me.

45:23.500 --> 45:27.567
Oh, I actually--
I'm not busy right now

45:27.700 --> 45:30.200
but I really should
be getting back to it.

45:30.333 --> 45:34.567
I just--
I'm so behind and so uninspired.

45:34.700 --> 45:37.200
What was that line
from the Wordsworth poem?

45:37.333 --> 45:39.900
He wrote a lot, which one?

45:40.033 --> 45:41.600
The one you quoted me.

45:41.734 --> 45:45.100
Ah. "Nature never did betray
the heart that loved her."

45:45.233 --> 45:46.734
That's the one.

45:46.867 --> 45:48.467
What don't we get
you out to nature?

45:48.600 --> 45:52.433
I tried that yesterday
and she wasn't very hospitable.

45:52.567 --> 45:55.200
Doesn't sound like her.

45:55.333 --> 45:56.767
Maybe you need
a proper introduction.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.300
You mean like a wingman?

45:59.433 --> 46:00.867
I don't know what that means,
but if you'll come with me,

46:01.000 --> 46:02.233
them yes.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.133
To be honest,
I could use the company.

46:07.266 --> 46:08.867
Feeling a bit
unmoored at the moment.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.166
I'll let you sit in the front.

46:15.066 --> 46:16.867
Must get my coat.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.000
Danny:
I'm feeling pretty
lucky that I peeled you

46:25.133 --> 46:27.000
away from that paper.

46:27.133 --> 46:28.333
Joss:
Please, don't remind me.

46:28.467 --> 46:29.967
I'm having enough
guilt as it is.

46:30.100 --> 46:32.800
Danny:
My apologies.
It's just up this way.

46:32.934 --> 46:34.333
Joss:
Wait a minute,
I recognize this place

46:34.467 --> 46:35.800
from my mom's old home videos.

46:35.934 --> 46:37.333
Danny:
Really?

46:37.467 --> 46:39.066
Joss:
She used to talk
about this all the time.

46:43.100 --> 46:45.033
She would climb to the clifftop
and sit there for hours

46:45.166 --> 46:48.200
when she was young, just waiting
for the sunset, reading.

46:48.333 --> 46:50.633
Taking pictures.
It was calming for her.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.500
Yeah, we do have proper sunsets.

47:04.700 --> 47:06.533
Okay, it's just
a little bit further.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.934
It doesn't really look safe.

47:21.533 --> 47:23.100
Danny:
You coming?

47:23.233 --> 47:26.633
Joss:
This will pass.
It's okay. This will pass.

47:28.567 --> 47:29.867
You alright?

47:31.467 --> 47:32.433
Get the paper in.

47:32.567 --> 47:33.567
But what if I don't?

47:33.700 --> 47:34.934
It's okay. This will pass.

47:35.066 --> 47:36.000
Almost there.

47:36.133 --> 47:37.700
I can't.

47:37.834 --> 47:39.000
Of course you can.

47:39.133 --> 47:40.233
You got this.
Just down the path.

47:40.367 --> 47:42.200
No, I can't.

47:42.333 --> 47:43.934
Okay, we'll turn back.

47:48.967 --> 47:51.400
Sorry about that back there.

47:51.533 --> 47:53.767
Nothing to be sorry about.
It's my fault for pushing you.

47:55.233 --> 47:58.200
I've been dealing with them,
anxiety attacks,

47:58.333 --> 47:59.767
since I was young.

47:59.900 --> 48:01.967
How young?

48:02.100 --> 48:03.934
They started when I was nine.

48:04.066 --> 48:07.667
I was in a car accident
with my dad. He died.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.767
I'm so sorry.

48:11.233 --> 48:13.066
I was always
a reserved kid before,

48:13.200 --> 48:15.500
but afterwards the fear just...

48:17.734 --> 48:21.100
Just took root
and never left.

48:23.633 --> 48:27.834
Mom always encouraged me to
push past it, take some risks.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.400
She actually still is.

48:32.533 --> 48:35.233
This whole trip is
a birthday present from her.

48:35.367 --> 48:36.600
When was your birthday?

48:36.734 --> 48:39.166
It's coming up,
it's on Saturday.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.166
Oh, great! Any fun plans?

48:41.300 --> 48:45.300
Well, at the moment,
quietly contemplating the course

48:45.433 --> 48:47.800
of my life,
whether it was a mistake

48:47.934 --> 48:49.400
to come here when I should be

48:49.533 --> 48:51.567
focused on
my professional goals.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.600
Is that before
or after the cake?

48:57.734 --> 49:00.567
Here, this is what
I wanted to show you.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.967
Why does this make me so happy?

49:18.100 --> 49:19.867
I know you're a book worm,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.700
but you really take it to
the next metamorphosis.

49:23.834 --> 49:26.333
What would that be?
A book butterfly?

49:26.467 --> 49:30.367
If you're calling me a nerd,
I'm totally okay with that.

49:32.867 --> 49:36.200
Oh, I love this quote
by Oscar Wilde.

49:36.333 --> 49:37.967
"It's what you read
when you don't have to,

49:38.100 --> 49:40.667
that determines who you will
be when you can't help it."

49:40.800 --> 49:42.633
For those of us without
a degree in English literature,

49:42.767 --> 49:44.033
what does that mean?

49:45.967 --> 49:48.000
What you choose to
fill your mind with...

49:49.500 --> 49:52.834
...has a huge impact on
who you are as a person.

49:52.967 --> 49:54.300
So, you are what you read.

49:54.433 --> 49:55.667
Essentially.

49:55.800 --> 49:56.900
That is a scary thought.

49:57.033 --> 49:58.700
Which way is
the comic book section?

50:00.800 --> 50:03.633
I'm going to get us a table
at my favorite little cafe.

50:03.767 --> 50:06.066
Why don't you find yourself
a birthday gift from me?

50:06.200 --> 50:07.367
You don't have to do that.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.300
I know, but I'm English,

50:09.433 --> 50:10.834
being a gentleman
comes naturally.

50:13.033 --> 50:13.900
Cashier:
Thank you.

50:27.867 --> 50:29.533
Gran! I scored a--

50:29.667 --> 50:31.400
No boots in the house, dear.

50:31.533 --> 50:33.100
Door!

50:35.133 --> 50:36.233
That's my girl.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.166
Now what were you saying?

50:39.300 --> 50:41.200
I scored a goal
at training today.

50:41.333 --> 50:42.500
That's wonderful!

50:42.633 --> 50:44.467
Where's dad? I want to tell him.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.734
Your father is
out at the moment.

50:45.867 --> 50:47.200
That's okay.
I can tell Joss then.

50:47.333 --> 50:50.633
I'm afraid he's out with Joss.

50:50.767 --> 50:52.066
I believe he's driven
her to the cove.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.066
I'm sorry, dear.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.734
That's okay, I like Joss.

50:54.867 --> 50:56.400
Do you?

50:56.533 --> 50:58.233
Daddy does, too. I can tell.

50:58.367 --> 50:59.367
Is that so?

50:59.500 --> 51:01.200
I don't know if he fancies her,

51:01.333 --> 51:02.567
but he definitely likes her.

51:02.700 --> 51:04.066
What do you think?

51:04.200 --> 51:08.233
I assure you,
I don't know what to think.

51:08.367 --> 51:10.967
Off you go. To the bathroom.

51:11.100 --> 51:13.133
I don't want you stinking
at the dinner table.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.967
I am so excited to read this

51:24.100 --> 51:25.800
as soon as I get
a chance to pleasure read.

51:25.934 --> 51:27.033
Thank you.

51:27.166 --> 51:28.500
My pleasure. More tea?

51:28.633 --> 51:30.500
As long as you don't
have to get back.

51:30.633 --> 51:32.467
Soon, but I'm lucky.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.700
My mother makes an amazing gran.

51:34.834 --> 51:37.834
We've become quite
the team raising my daughter.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.667
Tegan mentioned
it's just the two of you.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.100
Must be hard.

51:42.233 --> 51:45.367
Is that your clever way
of asking if I'm single?

51:45.500 --> 51:47.600
It wasn't,

51:47.734 --> 51:50.433
but now that you mention it.

51:50.567 --> 51:53.367
I am,
and have been for a long time.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.867
Catherine, and I met in London.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.367
We got married
right after graduation,

51:58.500 --> 52:01.600
against our parents' wishes.

52:01.734 --> 52:04.533
I was in business school
when Tegan was born.

52:04.667 --> 52:08.433
And things changed quickly.

52:08.567 --> 52:12.700
Her parents cut her off,
and we started arguing.

52:12.834 --> 52:14.433
A lot.

52:14.567 --> 52:15.800
It was difficult.

52:18.066 --> 52:22.867
One day, I came home after class
and Tegan was with a babysitter.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.433
I never saw her again.

52:28.033 --> 52:29.667
She just left?

52:29.800 --> 52:34.200
She left a note saying that
it had gotten too much for her.

52:38.166 --> 52:40.266
And, um...

52:40.400 --> 52:42.166
Tegan doesn't remember,
though, luckily.

52:42.300 --> 52:44.266
In her mind,
it's just been the two of us.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.867
I'm so sorry.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.367
Don't be.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.567
It's in the past.

52:50.700 --> 52:51.967
Where it belongs.

52:55.734 --> 52:57.867
You have an uncanny ability
to live in the present.

52:59.467 --> 53:02.400
I'm always going over
what happened in the past

53:02.533 --> 53:05.066
and worrying about what's
going to happen in the future.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.633
Life's too short to
deal with all that stress.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.100
All we can do is
deal with the problems

53:09.233 --> 53:10.767
right in front of us

53:10.900 --> 53:12.600
and choose what
brings us the most joy.

53:12.734 --> 53:14.500
That's beautiful.

53:14.633 --> 53:16.000
It's a Carter original.

53:16.133 --> 53:17.800
I thought so.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.467
Are you okay?

53:25.600 --> 53:30.400
All this talk about
"joy" and "reading"

53:30.533 --> 53:32.100
has me worried
about my Tegan.

53:33.266 --> 53:35.066
She's going to be alright.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.967
I have a meeting
coming up with her teacher.

53:39.533 --> 53:42.333
Could I trouble you to join me?

53:42.467 --> 53:44.066
You make me feel
much more comfortable.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.967
Of course.

53:48.467 --> 53:49.767
Of course.

53:52.200 --> 53:55.066
Today we're going to try
something a little different.

53:55.200 --> 53:57.100
Alright, I'm going to
read you the words

53:57.233 --> 53:59.433
to one of my very
favorite Wordsworth poems

53:59.567 --> 54:01.233
What's a Wordsworth poem?

54:01.367 --> 54:05.867
Well, Wordsworth was a man
who wrote spectacular poetry.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.567
So, you're going to
listen to the words,

54:07.700 --> 54:10.533
and then you're going
to write the words,

54:10.667 --> 54:12.300
but with pictures.

54:12.433 --> 54:13.700
Sounds hard.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.033
Sure, but it's good
to have a challenge,

54:16.166 --> 54:18.300
you know,
like in soccer practice.

54:18.433 --> 54:20.166
You mean football?

54:20.300 --> 54:22.667
Yes. Yes, I mean football.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.166
Okay, should we try it?

54:25.633 --> 54:29.133
Here's your pencils. Alright.

54:29.266 --> 54:32.033
I wandered lonely as a cloud.

54:32.166 --> 54:33.600
That one's easy.

54:36.533 --> 54:39.000
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills.

54:39.133 --> 54:40.233
What's a vale?

54:40.367 --> 54:41.400
It's a valley.

54:45.934 --> 54:47.633
When all at once I saw a crowd,

54:47.767 --> 54:50.467
a host of golden daffodils.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.400
Slow down!
I can't draw that fast!

54:53.533 --> 54:56.000
It's alright. Just try not to
be intimidated by the words,

54:56.133 --> 54:58.967
listen to them and think
about how they make you feel,

54:59.100 --> 55:00.533
what they remind you of.

55:00.667 --> 55:02.900
Think about the lyrics
to your favorite song.

55:03.033 --> 55:04.367
The lyrics don't
always make sense,

55:04.500 --> 55:06.700
but they feel right.

55:06.834 --> 55:07.967
Alright, keep going.

55:08.100 --> 55:11.266
Beside the lake,
beneath the trees,

55:11.400 --> 55:14.600
fluttering and dancing
in the breeze.

55:14.734 --> 55:17.633
Continuous as
the stars that shine

55:17.767 --> 55:20.600
and twinkle on the milky way,

55:20.734 --> 55:24.233
they stretched
in never-ending line

55:24.367 --> 55:27.200
along the margin of a bay.

55:27.333 --> 55:31.400
Ten-thousand saw I at a glance,

55:31.533 --> 55:35.100
tossing their heads
in sprightly dance.

55:43.400 --> 55:44.934
Joss:
Her symptoms were subtle.

55:45.066 --> 55:47.133
I wouldn't have noticed
if I hadn't seen it before.

55:47.266 --> 55:49.433
I appreciate your notes,
Dr. Lambert.

55:49.567 --> 55:51.867
Of course we will need to
get a full evaluation done,

55:52.000 --> 55:53.567
starting with our
occupational therapist.

55:53.700 --> 55:57.300
I did see signs, I just...

55:59.066 --> 56:01.300
I thought she was adjusting
to her new life here.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.467
I thought it was a phase.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.967
It's difficult to fully
diagnose it unless you know

56:07.100 --> 56:10.033
what you're looking for,
but early intervention is key.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.800
Yeah, I just don't
want her to be labeled.

56:12.934 --> 56:14.667
That isn't going to happen here.

56:14.800 --> 56:18.633
Mr. Carter, it doesn't do us any
good being hard on ourselves.

56:20.166 --> 56:21.367
We are only responsible
for how we handle this

56:21.500 --> 56:22.734
with Tegan moving forward.

56:24.767 --> 56:26.000
What do we do
about the festival?

56:26.133 --> 56:28.367
That is completely up to Tegan.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.367
If she wants to
read her poem, great.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.033
Or she can read
something else she likes.

56:32.166 --> 56:33.300
Or, nothing at all.

56:33.433 --> 56:35.033
That's okay too.

56:35.166 --> 56:36.500
She can lead
the charge on this one.

56:38.667 --> 56:41.500
There are no labels here.
Only support.

57:07.867 --> 57:10.166
Merryn:
You should've just
left it up to the teacher.

57:10.300 --> 57:13.066
I did.
Joss was only there to help.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.433
You shouldn't involve her
any more than you have.

57:15.567 --> 57:17.033
It was the right move.

57:17.166 --> 57:19.934
Everything is always a brilliant
idea with you, isn't it?

57:20.066 --> 57:21.700
Until it's not.

57:21.834 --> 57:23.166
Excuse me?

57:23.300 --> 57:26.233
You always lead
with your heart

57:26.367 --> 57:28.166
at the expense of
everyone around you.

57:28.300 --> 57:30.166
Are we done here?

57:30.300 --> 57:32.567
Doesn't look like you are.

57:32.700 --> 57:34.600
I've seen your plans.

57:34.734 --> 57:36.166
You look through my things?

57:36.300 --> 57:38.166
You left them out.

57:38.300 --> 57:40.367
Were you going to
talk to me about this

57:40.500 --> 57:42.667
or just leave me to
wake up to the apocalypse?

57:42.800 --> 57:44.500
Nothing has been decided yet.

57:44.633 --> 57:48.100
The how do you explain this
perfect little map of yours?

57:51.133 --> 57:52.233
It's all planned out is it?

57:52.367 --> 57:53.233
Just my thoughts
on where they should go.

57:53.367 --> 57:54.900
I don't want to hear it.

57:55.033 --> 57:57.567
You promised me.

57:57.700 --> 58:00.333
Imagine how your father
would feel if he knew this is

58:00.467 --> 58:02.133
what you were going to do to
his farm when you took over.

58:02.266 --> 58:06.500
And imagine how your mother will
feel when she watches her son

58:06.633 --> 58:10.800
give his heart away to another
woman who is bound to leave.

58:19.100 --> 58:20.467
Joss:
And then he let me pick out

58:20.600 --> 58:22.066
a book for my birthday.
Okay, I think I'm done.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.166
With what?

58:23.300 --> 58:24.734
Living vicariously through you.

58:24.867 --> 58:26.000
I want to browse old books

58:26.133 --> 58:28.567
with an Englishman. No fair.

58:28.700 --> 58:30.166
So, he's cute?

58:30.300 --> 58:32.333
It doesn't matter
because he lives in England,

58:32.467 --> 58:34.734
and I'm leaving on Sunday.

58:34.867 --> 58:36.467
Still could be fun.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.567
You know what would be fun
is if you got on the redeye,

58:38.700 --> 58:40.166
and you came
and met me at the festival.

58:40.300 --> 58:41.400
That'd be fun.

58:41.533 --> 58:42.500
I wish.

58:42.633 --> 58:44.734
You know I wish.

58:44.867 --> 58:46.233
Did you get your paper in?

58:46.367 --> 58:50.066
Nope, nope, nope. No, I did not.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.166
What? Why?
I thought you needed this.

58:52.300 --> 58:54.166
I do or at least, I don't know,

58:54.300 --> 58:55.800
everyone keeps
telling me that I do,

58:55.934 --> 58:58.033
but it's like every time
I open my laptop,

58:58.166 --> 59:00.867
just this wave of exhaustion

59:01.000 --> 59:04.033
just flows over me.

59:04.166 --> 59:05.400
Burn out.
Do you remember Gareth?

59:05.533 --> 59:07.133
The guy I who trained me?

59:07.266 --> 59:09.567
He just up and quit.
No job, no plan, no nothing.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.133
That is terrifying.

59:11.266 --> 59:12.433
Or is it brave?

59:12.567 --> 59:14.367
I'm sticking with terrifying.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.066
Well in that case,
you might want to stock up on

59:16.200 --> 59:18.567
some Galaxy bars and take
another crack at that paper.

59:18.700 --> 59:20.567
In that case,
I'm going to stay here forever.

59:20.700 --> 59:22.033
Aw. Love you.

59:22.166 --> 59:23.467
Love you, too. Bye.

59:39.333 --> 59:42.967
Hi, there.
May I use your printer, please?

59:43.100 --> 59:44.600
Of course.

59:49.100 --> 59:50.700
So sorry to bother you.

59:50.834 --> 59:53.900
Oh, you're very welcome as long
as you know how it works.

59:54.033 --> 59:55.767
I'm rather old fashioned,
I'm afraid.

59:55.900 --> 59:59.300
Oh, well.
So am I, believe it or not.

59:59.433 --> 1:00:01.033
It's actually why I need it.

1:00:01.166 --> 1:00:02.734
Most people prefer to make
notes on a computer these days,

1:00:02.867 --> 1:00:06.300
but I actually like
the hardcopy with a red pen.

1:00:08.667 --> 1:00:10.533
You should see my manuscripts.

1:00:10.667 --> 1:00:12.467
All the notes in the margins

1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:15.133
they just look
like hieroglyphics.

1:00:15.266 --> 1:00:16.400
Probably hard to decipher them,

1:00:16.533 --> 1:00:20.333
but you know, it's my process.

1:00:22.367 --> 1:00:24.700
It's on the desk in the corner.

1:00:24.834 --> 1:00:26.066
Thank you.

1:00:31.066 --> 1:00:32.600
Carol Lambert.

1:00:35.233 --> 1:00:36.900
She made your reservation,
didn't she?

1:00:37.033 --> 1:00:40.133
My mom.

1:00:40.266 --> 1:00:41.867
Yeah.

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.767
What was her maiden name?

1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:46.400
Penberthy.

1:00:46.533 --> 1:00:50.800
You know, she actually
grew up in this house.

1:00:50.934 --> 1:00:53.700
My grandparents are
the ones who sold it to you.

1:00:53.834 --> 1:00:56.300
Would you excuse me a moment?

1:01:00.100 --> 1:01:01.667
Of course.

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:17.133
Joss.

1:01:17.266 --> 1:01:18.700
I have something for you.

1:01:20.900 --> 1:01:24.834
I found this box
about a year ago,

1:01:24.967 --> 1:01:27.367
when I was
clearing out the mill.

1:01:28.934 --> 1:01:30.734
I assumed it must've
been left by your--

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.300
By your mother.

1:01:43.467 --> 1:01:46.433
It just looked like
some old trinkets,

1:01:46.567 --> 1:01:48.967
and that tattered book.

1:01:53.333 --> 1:01:55.200
But I remember
thinking at the time,

1:01:55.333 --> 1:01:58.433
I can't just throw them away.

1:01:58.567 --> 1:02:01.033
They're someone's treasures.

1:02:06.867 --> 1:02:08.867
It's from my grandma to my mom.

1:02:15.166 --> 1:02:17.867
She memorized all these poems,
she would recite them to me.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.600
I wonder if she
knew this was here.

1:02:26.967 --> 1:02:28.700
Ever since she died,
I feel like...

1:02:30.867 --> 1:02:32.967
something important
has gone missing.

1:02:36.233 --> 1:02:37.266
I keep searching for her,

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:38.867
as if she's just out of sight,

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.200
and if I just
look hard enough...

1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.767
That I can find her, again.

1:02:47.900 --> 1:02:51.867
Loss is a terrible thing.

1:02:53.967 --> 1:02:55.767
It never completely goes away.

1:03:03.633 --> 1:03:04.967
I miss her so much.

1:03:06.367 --> 1:03:07.767
Ah, love.

1:03:11.467 --> 1:03:13.000
She's still with you.

1:03:13.133 --> 1:03:17.400
Her love lives inside of you,

1:03:17.533 --> 1:03:20.700
and you carry her in your heart.

1:03:24.734 --> 1:03:27.500
I'd give anything
to see her again.

1:03:29.266 --> 1:03:30.834
You will.

1:03:34.734 --> 1:03:36.000
I'll leave you to it.

1:03:39.700 --> 1:03:41.467
Take as long as you need.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.000
Thank you.

1:04:07.667 --> 1:04:09.800
The Presence of Love.

1:04:17.533 --> 1:04:20.567
Oh, mom.

1:04:32.834 --> 1:04:34.633
Danny:
Okay, shouldn't be
a long meeting.

1:04:34.767 --> 1:04:36.300
They're just gonna
go over the testing with you

1:04:36.433 --> 1:04:38.900
and introduce you
to some key people. Alright?

1:04:39.033 --> 1:04:40.266
Okay.

1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:44.333
I know it's not easy.

1:04:44.467 --> 1:04:45.633
You mean, reading?

1:04:45.767 --> 1:04:47.800
Just life, in general.

1:04:47.934 --> 1:04:49.734
There are so many
emotions we have to navigate.

1:04:52.100 --> 1:04:54.233
But--

1:04:54.367 --> 1:04:56.133
You have me,

1:04:56.266 --> 1:04:58.000
and you can talk to me
about anything, yeah?

1:04:58.133 --> 1:04:59.500
I know, Dad.

1:04:59.633 --> 1:05:01.633
Yeah, and it's not just me.

1:05:01.767 --> 1:05:04.233
There's so many people
in your life that love you.

1:05:04.367 --> 1:05:06.767
You have Isabelle
and Felix and Lily,

1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:08.533
and your Gran, of course.

1:05:08.667 --> 1:05:11.367
You can talk to any of us about
anything whenever you want.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.000
I'm glad we came here.

1:05:14.700 --> 1:05:15.700
To the farm.

1:05:15.834 --> 1:05:17.400
Me, too, love.

1:05:17.533 --> 1:05:19.033
Alright. Let's get in there

1:05:19.166 --> 1:05:20.800
and show them what the
Carters are made of.

1:05:22.533 --> 1:05:23.967
Come on.
Let's do it.

1:06:54.367 --> 1:06:55.467
Someone is still
hard at work.

1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:57.800
Oh. No.
Not really. Hi!

1:06:57.934 --> 1:06:59.233
Tegan:
Hi, Joss.

1:06:59.367 --> 1:07:00.934
Daniel:
No?

1:07:01.066 --> 1:07:03.967
Yeah. At this point, I'm
just reading for pleasure.

1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:05.467
I hope it's your
birthday book.

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:06.633
It's your birthday?

1:07:06.767 --> 1:07:08.000
Tomorrow.

1:07:08.133 --> 1:07:11.166
Hang on. If you're out
here, relaxing,

1:07:11.300 --> 1:07:13.266
does that mean you
turned in your paper?

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:15.367
No.
No?

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:20.166
Because I, uh, withdrew
my application for tenure.

1:07:20.300 --> 1:07:23.667
I thought that was the goal.
It was, but I realized

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:27.667
that all that tenure is
is professional security.

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:31.333
I think I confused a
secure job with safety.

1:07:31.467 --> 1:07:34.000
There's no guarantees.

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.533
Life's a risk.

1:07:36.667 --> 1:07:38.700
I think I have to
embrace it.

1:07:38.834 --> 1:07:39.834
Really?

1:07:39.967 --> 1:07:42.867
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.600
I didn't quit my job, though, if
that's what you're asking.

1:07:45.734 --> 1:07:47.667
No.

1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:52.166
I, uh, I requested to stay on
as an adjunct professor for now.

1:07:52.300 --> 1:07:54.433
The dean already ask me if I
want to teach the summer term.

1:07:54.567 --> 1:07:57.133
Well, this sounds like a
decision worth celebrating.

1:07:57.266 --> 1:07:59.967
I think.

1:08:00.166 --> 1:08:03.433
Tegan... I have something
I want to give you. Come here.

1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:07.600
It's for you.
What is it?

1:08:07.734 --> 1:08:11.000
It's a book of poetry that
my grandparents gave to my mom.

1:08:11.133 --> 1:08:12.767
She had dyslexia, too.

1:08:12.900 --> 1:08:14.600
Your mom?

1:08:14.734 --> 1:08:16.900
Yeah.

1:08:17.033 --> 1:08:19.500
You'll see all
of her notations,

1:08:19.633 --> 1:08:22.700
that she saw the
poetry differently than I do,

1:08:22.834 --> 1:08:25.800
but a beautiful
way that's all her own.

1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:28.567
You'll see.

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:30.266
There's no wrong way.

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:32.500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1:08:32.633 --> 1:08:33.867
I'm going to go
tell Gran.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.367
Okay.

1:08:37.033 --> 1:08:38.600
Thank you.

1:08:38.734 --> 1:08:39.900
It's nothing.

1:08:40.033 --> 1:08:41.967
No. We both know it's
everything.

1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:47.867
I know you were planning
on attending anyway,

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.500
but, um... we'd really love
for you to ride along with us.

1:08:52.633 --> 1:08:53.867
To the festival?

1:08:56.467 --> 1:08:57.834
I'd love to.

1:08:57.967 --> 1:09:00.100
Okay. Brill.

1:09:01.133 --> 1:09:02.000
Brill.
Yeah.

1:09:17.967 --> 1:09:19.133
Do you
have everything?

1:09:19.266 --> 1:09:21.333
Yes.
I've already checked twice.

1:09:21.467 --> 1:09:23.000
Third time's a charm.
Now, remember,

1:09:23.133 --> 1:09:25.133
when you're up there, just
see how you feel, okay?

1:09:25.266 --> 1:09:26.734
Look. Could we get a move on?

1:09:26.867 --> 1:09:28.667
I want to be right at the front.
I'll meet you in there.

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.667
I just need a minute, alright?
Let's make that

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.333
a British minute, shall we? Not
the American interpretation.

1:09:34.467 --> 1:09:35.867
Of course.

1:09:59.066 --> 1:10:01.166
Woman:
I wonder that you
will still be talking.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.667
Signior Benedick, nobody
marks you.

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:05.100
Man:
What, my dear Lady--

1:10:05.233 --> 1:10:08.600
Oh, there's an
exclamation mark. Disdain!

1:10:08.734 --> 1:10:10.467
...and the door of
your heart.

1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:12.500
May the road rise up...

1:10:12.633 --> 1:10:16.000
There was once a
day that owed time.

1:10:16.133 --> 1:10:18.767
Girl:
With their trouble
behind, side by side,

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:21.133
then the wolf and the
rabbit pushed off to sea

1:10:21.266 --> 1:10:23.734
and traveled to the one
place they could run free.

1:10:33.133 --> 1:10:34.934
Alright, everyone.

1:10:35.066 --> 1:10:37.867
It looks like we have
one more reading.

1:10:44.233 --> 1:10:46.633
Hi. I wrote a
poem for today,

1:10:46.767 --> 1:10:48.333
but I'm not going
to read it.

1:10:48.467 --> 1:10:50.166
It wasn't ready.

1:10:50.300 --> 1:10:51.734
I'm going
to read a poem

1:10:51.867 --> 1:10:54.467
that somebody else
wrote instead,

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:56.667
a special one from
a friend,

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.934
"The Presence of Love"
by Samuel Coleridge.

1:11:00.133 --> 1:11:03.200
"And in
Life's noisiest hour,

1:11:03.333 --> 1:11:05.133
there whispers still

1:11:05.266 --> 1:11:08.667
the ceaseless Love
of Thee,

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:13.400
The heart's Self-solace
and soliloquy.

1:11:13.533 --> 1:11:15.300
You mould my Hopes,

1:11:15.433 --> 1:11:17.500
you fashion me within...

1:11:17.633 --> 1:11:19.633
And looking
to the Heaven,

1:11:19.767 --> 1:11:22.567
that bends above you,

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:26.467
How oft! I bless the Lot,
that made me love you."

1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:38.533
Oh, you did so good!

1:11:38.667 --> 1:11:41.200
I'm so proud of you.

1:11:41.333 --> 1:11:43.900
You must thank Ms.
Lambert for all her help.

1:11:44.033 --> 1:11:45.533
Thank you so much.

1:11:45.667 --> 1:11:47.567
Oh. Of course.

1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:49.667
You were fantastic,

1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.533
and you do know that's my
very favorite poem?

1:11:53.667 --> 1:11:56.033
I didn't have a present to
give you, so I wanted

1:11:56.166 --> 1:11:58.967
to read the poem at the
festival for your birthday.

1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:02.734
Gran helped with the cards,
so it's partly from her, too.

1:12:04.367 --> 1:12:05.967
It was perfect.

1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:07.633
Now, let's get
you a cake.

1:12:07.767 --> 1:12:08.900
That's a brilliant idea.

1:12:09.033 --> 1:12:10.567
I don't
need a cake.

1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:12.433
It's your birthday.

1:12:12.567 --> 1:12:13.934
I know, but it's
not a big one.

1:12:14.066 --> 1:12:15.200
Still, we should go out.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:17.467
Every year should
be celebrated.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:19.767
And you, little missy,

1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:21.300
have your own party to go to.

1:12:21.433 --> 1:12:23.066
So you should go
and join your classmates.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.266
Yes!
Yeah.

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:25.734
I'll take her to
the party.

1:12:25.867 --> 1:12:28.767
You two
should go out.

1:12:28.900 --> 1:12:30.900
Tegan, your
fans await you.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:38.967
Should we walk around?

1:12:39.100 --> 1:12:39.967
Yeah. Sure.

1:12:54.066 --> 1:12:55.200
I still got to
get you that cake.

1:12:55.333 --> 1:12:57.433
Oh. It's just
a silly birthday.

1:12:57.567 --> 1:12:59.533
I don't need
anything special.

1:12:59.667 --> 1:13:01.300
This view is enough.

1:13:04.166 --> 1:13:06.467
What if I want
to do more?

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:09.300
There's so much I
can show you.

1:13:09.433 --> 1:13:11.000
I'd like
that, but...

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000
I'm leaving in
the morning.

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.100
Can't believe it's
almost been two weeks.

1:13:19.233 --> 1:13:20.633
Then stay longer.

1:13:22.133 --> 1:13:24.500
Don't tempt me.
I have to get home.

1:13:24.633 --> 1:13:26.633
Then let's celebrate right
now, tonight.

1:13:27.834 --> 1:13:29.834
I feel like
I already did.

1:13:30.967 --> 1:13:32.967
Right here.

1:13:33.100 --> 1:13:35.133
This place that she
always wanted me to see.

1:13:36.333 --> 1:13:39.133
The festival we
planned to attend.

1:13:39.266 --> 1:13:42.066
It's easier if I
go back now.

1:13:43.834 --> 1:13:46.500
Can I at least take you to
the station tomorrow?

1:13:46.633 --> 1:13:48.700
Everything has all
been so perfect.

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:52.567
I think I'd rather just
end on this.

1:13:55.300 --> 1:13:56.700
This?

1:13:58.734 --> 1:14:03.266
This sounds 19th century...
and not very promising.

1:14:16.867 --> 1:14:18.567
"You lie in all
my many thoughts."

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:18.100
Okay. Make sure to
get the mill in it, yeah?

1:16:18.233 --> 1:16:19.500
Thank you.

1:16:20.934 --> 1:16:22.166
Thanks.
Okay.

1:16:40.266 --> 1:16:43.100
Hey.

1:16:43.233 --> 1:16:45.400
I'll miss you.

1:16:45.533 --> 1:16:48.033
So will I.

1:16:48.166 --> 1:16:50.266
I'm so glad you
got to see this place.

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:51.934
Me, too.

1:16:52.066 --> 1:16:54.867
I'm not sure the
experience was

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.567
quite what you
wanted it to be.

1:16:58.100 --> 1:16:59.400
It was so much more.

1:17:09.433 --> 1:17:11.000
You give your dad
a hug for me.

1:17:11.133 --> 1:17:12.000
Okay.

1:17:20.834 --> 1:17:22.233
Thank you.

1:18:00.734 --> 1:18:02.133
What?

1:18:03.667 --> 1:18:05.233
I have to tell you something.

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.166
Your tea method is
far superior to mine.

1:18:13.867 --> 1:18:16.300
I'm glad you've
finally come around.

1:18:16.433 --> 1:18:18.000
Thank you.

1:18:22.033 --> 1:18:24.300
What about the turbines?

1:18:24.433 --> 1:18:26.600
Any chance you've
come around to those?

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:29.867
We have to address it.

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.033
So let's address it.

1:18:32.166 --> 1:18:34.633
They are hideous
and noisy.

1:18:34.767 --> 1:18:37.367
They'll be on the far
west pasture on the hill.

1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:39.533
The noise will be minimal.
And what about the sheep?

1:18:39.667 --> 1:18:41.567
What about the sheep?
They won't like it.

1:18:41.700 --> 1:18:43.000
Well, they told you
that, did they?

1:18:47.066 --> 1:18:48.233
I know this
is hard for you.

1:18:52.333 --> 1:18:54.500
But it's an opportunity
that would really help us.

1:18:56.900 --> 1:18:58.500
I think we should do it.

1:19:01.734 --> 1:19:03.133
Very well.

1:19:05.333 --> 1:19:06.867
Go ahead.

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.633
You have my blessing.

1:19:13.100 --> 1:19:15.633
It must feel like you're losing
everything you hold dear,

1:19:15.767 --> 1:19:17.734
but I promise you
I'll never let that happen.

1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:21.300
I love
this place, too.

1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:24.867
So does Tegan.

1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:29.367
We're doing it
for her, too, Mum.

1:19:34.100 --> 1:19:35.500
Ah, come here.

1:19:38.433 --> 1:19:40.533
Forgive me for what
I said to you.

1:19:41.667 --> 1:19:43.000
It was wicked,

1:19:43.133 --> 1:19:45.400
and I've regretted
it ever since.

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.633
Your father would be very
proud of you, my boy.

1:19:52.433 --> 1:19:56.800
You're a wonderful man
and an excellent father.

1:19:56.934 --> 1:19:58.800
Mm.

1:19:58.934 --> 1:20:01.767
And you deserve
to be loved

1:20:01.900 --> 1:20:04.433
by someone who cares as
deeply as you do.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.467
Man on speaker:
Train to Paddington
leaves in two minutes.

1:20:30.333 --> 1:20:32.834
Joss!

1:20:32.967 --> 1:20:34.300
Hey.

1:20:34.433 --> 1:20:36.300
What are you doing here?

1:20:36.433 --> 1:20:38.033
I need to stop you
from getting on that train.

1:20:38.166 --> 1:20:39.500
But I--
Please, I've got two minutes

1:20:39.633 --> 1:20:42.834
to say this to you,
so let me just say it.

1:20:44.433 --> 1:20:46.667
You came to Cornwall
for many reasons,

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:48.633
and I know that I
wasn't one of them.

1:20:48.767 --> 1:20:50.333
In fact, I'm
probably to blame

1:20:50.467 --> 1:20:52.333
for constantly distracting
you from your research paper

1:20:52.467 --> 1:20:54.633
and-- and stopping you
from achieving

1:20:54.767 --> 1:20:56.867
the thing you
most wanted to achieve.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.066
But in the words of the
great English poet,

1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:02.500
"You can't always
get what you want."

1:21:02.633 --> 1:21:05.834
I repeat. "You can't
always get what you want.

1:21:05.967 --> 1:21:07.734
But if you try sometimes,
you just might find..."

1:21:07.867 --> 1:21:09.233
"You get what
you need."

1:21:09.367 --> 1:21:10.867
That's the one.

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.867
Don't leave, Joss.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.200
Use the cottage as a base.
Travel the world.

1:21:15.333 --> 1:21:16.834
Fill up that
passport of yours.

1:21:16.967 --> 1:21:19.200
Eat every single piece
of chocolate you can find

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:23.100
and-- and read every single
book that you wanted to, twice.

1:21:23.233 --> 1:21:26.367
You're an expert
in Romantic literature.

1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:27.600
Don't you think it's
time you did something

1:21:27.734 --> 1:21:29.233
perfectly romantic?

1:21:30.967 --> 1:21:33.100
I have a life
back in Boston.

1:21:33.233 --> 1:21:35.200
An apartment, friends.

1:21:35.333 --> 1:21:38.834
A professor once told
me that life is a risk.

1:21:38.967 --> 1:21:40.600
You just have to
embrace it.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:45.000
Do you know how scary
that would actually be?

1:21:45.133 --> 1:21:46.734
I know,

1:21:46.867 --> 1:21:48.367
but you'll have
the best wingman.

1:21:53.834 --> 1:21:55.667
Okay.

1:22:11.767 --> 1:22:13.166
You sure about this?

1:22:13.300 --> 1:22:15.233
No.

1:22:15.367 --> 1:22:18.233
I'm not, but I've
been banging my head

1:22:18.367 --> 1:22:20.433
against the same
rock wall for years.

1:22:20.567 --> 1:22:22.600
May as well try a
new direction,

1:22:22.734 --> 1:22:24.633
see how that
goes for a bit.

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.300
You want to give me
a ride back?

1:22:29.633 --> 1:22:31.200
Direct or scenic?

1:22:33.633 --> 1:22:35.600
What do you think?
Mm.

1:22:46.066 --> 1:22:49.800
You secured a luncheon
with Dylan Turner?

1:22:49.934 --> 1:22:51.633
Well, the kids are
so excited he's reading,

1:22:51.767 --> 1:22:53.233
I just wanted to
make the most of it.

1:22:53.367 --> 1:22:55.433
I mean, between that
and the panel of writers

1:22:55.567 --> 1:22:57.467
you pulled together, you
realize this festival

1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.066
is going to market itself?

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:01.133
I'm just happy
to be a part of it.

1:23:01.266 --> 1:23:02.667
Not as happy as I am.

1:23:04.300 --> 1:23:06.166
Although I doubt I'm the
most excited one here.

1:23:14.767 --> 1:23:17.400
I know this is your noisiest
hour, but I was wondering

1:23:17.533 --> 1:23:19.633
if you had the time to
take a walk with me.

1:23:25.867 --> 1:23:26.734
Always.
