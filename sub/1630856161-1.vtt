Do you live alone?

27:28.546 --> 27:31.182
-No. With my mom and dad.

27:31.182 --> 27:34.519
They're in the other room. Sshh.

[man] [over phone]
Oh. Oh, um...

What can I say?
I'm a naughty girl.

28:40.952 --> 28:42.921
[man] [over phone] I don't know
how I feel about that.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.355

29:00.305 --> 29:02.207
-Sorry, I was thirsty.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.111
I love milk. Want a taste?

29:07.011 --> 29:09.547
[man] [over phone]
How can I do that?

29:09.547 --> 29:14.285
-I'm downstairs
all by my lonely little self.

29:14.285 --> 29:16.621
[man] [over phone]
You're alone?

29:16.621 --> 29:19.991
-Mm-hm. I am now.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.326
Can I tell you something?

29:22.727 --> 29:24.729
Oh, baby.
-[man] Don't stop. Don't stop.

29:24.729 --> 29:26.131
[continues indistinctly]
-[Tammy] Your voice

29:26.131 --> 29:27.966
makes me wanna
run my fingers

29:27.966 --> 29:32.070
across my breasts,
down my belly,

29:32.070 --> 29:35.640
and slip my hands
into my underwear.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.144
[moans] Baby,
it makes me so wet.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.146

Yeah, I'm wet, baby. I'm wet.

Hello? Don't get shy
on me now, lover.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.005
Ugh.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.740
Well, if you're not
going to talk, then...

30:12.944 --> 30:15.513
[man] [over phone] You really
shouldn't be doing that.

30:15.513 --> 30:18.550
-Oh, no? What's that?

30:18.550 --> 30:20.618
[man] [over phone]
It's bad for your eyes

30:20.618 --> 30:23.021
to sit so close.

30:26.691 --> 30:27.926
[TV shuts off]

30:29.093 --> 30:30.295

I can hear you breathing,
asshole.

30:49.714 --> 30:52.083

I know the sins you committed.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.451
You're going to fucking hell!

kindly set in limbo.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.953
Hope rides a roller coaster

31:28.953 --> 31:32.190
and yet each day must be lived.

31:32.190 --> 31:36.828
Give unto your people
the blessing of your soul.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.931
You know the pain
of someone missing

31:39.931 --> 31:42.567
and the joy of
when you found them.

31:42.567 --> 31:49.040
Please pray for those
searching now, and help us.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.909
Pray for the joy.

you're looking for

36:16.040 --> 36:18.442
are right in front of you.

A woman just doesn't walk in
in the dead of night

45:23.087 --> 45:26.690
and tell you what happened.
Doesn't work like that.

is hard to accept.

No, no, no.
Not like this.

and we never have to see
these guys again.

49:26.029 --> 49:26.997
Okay?

We'll get the fuck out of here.

Anywhere you want to go.

50:58.655 --> 51:00.290
Yeah, see,
that doesn't work for me
