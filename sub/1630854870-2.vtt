WEBVTT

00:09.309 --> 00:11.311
I'll need you to
finalize those travel details

00:11.411 --> 00:12.979
for the conference in Frankfurt.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.382
And get Kevin to send me
my keynote speech, please.

00:15.482 --> 00:16.883
On its way, ma'am.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.485
Okay, I'll be in shortly.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.354
But I want the results of that
double-blind study in my inbox

00:21.454 --> 00:23.623
by the time I arrive.

00:39.639 --> 00:43.710
Danny?

00:59.092 --> 01:01.294
Danny?

01:27.487 --> 01:28.955
Uh, ma'am, you cannot be here.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.090
This is an open crime scene.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.593
I am Victoria Spencer.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.128
Uh--

01:35.228 --> 01:37.597
Marlina, oh my God,
are you alright?

01:37.697 --> 01:38.798
Vic, thank you for coming.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.300
I didn't know who else to call,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.402
and I knew we were
meeting for lunch, so...

01:42.502 --> 01:44.104
It's okay,
I'm here for you.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.306
What happened?
Are they saying anything?

01:46.406 --> 01:47.941
I just keep
expecting to wake up.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.410
Like this is just
some awful nightmare.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.745
I remember the feeling
when Sam died.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.815
It's awful.
I'm so sorry.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.854
Danny and I were supposed
to be married next month.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.388
I know.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.091
At my age,
it's so easy to feel...

02:05.191 --> 02:07.594
invisible.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.262
But when he looked at me,

02:09.362 --> 02:13.299
it was like I was
the only person in the world.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.836
Uh, Ms. Briggs?

02:16.936 --> 02:18.571
Excuse me,
I just want to let you know

02:18.671 --> 02:20.273
that we have
our best people on this,

02:20.373 --> 02:22.008
and I'm gonna do
everything in my power--

02:22.108 --> 02:24.010
Thank you, Detective Harris.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.315
Uh...

02:29.415 --> 02:31.985
That man couldn't find
a cow's ass in a barnyard.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.686
Sounds like
you don't have much faith

02:33.786 --> 02:35.388
in our newest detective.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.723
Oh, please.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.458
You remember that useless
excuse for an investigation

02:38.558 --> 02:40.193
when my research lab
was broken into?

02:40.293 --> 02:43.329
Oh, yes,
that was unfortunate.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.497
You know...

02:44.597 --> 02:48.868
Darby and I solved that
admissions scandal case...

02:48.968 --> 02:51.304
You told me.

02:51.404 --> 02:55.041
Maybe, if you like,
we could look into this for you.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.629
Will I ever
get out of here?

03:16.729 --> 03:19.365
Aw...

03:24.204 --> 03:27.574
Ugh...

03:27.674 --> 03:29.509
Is this how you're
waking me up now?

03:29.609 --> 03:32.245
Waking you up?
It's past 10 o'clock!

03:32.345 --> 03:33.846
Okay, never mind.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.049
I am so glad I caught you
before you left town.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.917
You need to get
down here right away.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.018
There's been a murder!

03:39.118 --> 03:40.486
What?
Who?

03:40.587 --> 03:43.423
My friend Marlina's fiancé,
Danny Moreau.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.525
Poor thing, she found him
drowned in a pool.

03:45.625 --> 03:46.960
And he was a lifeguard.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.063
You remember Marlina.
She's the CEO of Zanotec.

03:50.163 --> 03:53.533
They make that drug you took
for your acne in middle school.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.102
Yeah, I remember my acne.
Thank you.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.670
But, Mom,
this is a police matter.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.038
We shouldn't get involved.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.374
Well, Marlina doesn't trust
our new local detective,

04:01.474 --> 04:03.243
and frankly, neither do I,
and besides,

04:03.343 --> 04:04.944
we work so well together!

04:05.044 --> 04:08.815
No, I gotta get a real job.
I have to get my life together!

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
Okay, fine,
but just to look into it,

04:11.017 --> 04:14.020
she offered us $10,000.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.125
So, I'll be seeing you soon?

05:06.773 --> 05:09.776
Psst!

05:09.876 --> 05:10.843
What are you doing here?

05:10.943 --> 05:12.545
I thought you were
headed back to the city.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.780
I was.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.283
But then my mom called me
about all this craziness.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.685
Where is she, by the way?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.086
Upstairs with Ms. Briggs.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.788
But even if you
were still a cop,

05:21.888 --> 05:24.190
this isn't your jurisdiction.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.760
Oh wow, news sure spread fast
about the dynamic duo.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.096
Pretty sure Victoria
does her own PR.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.765
So Marlina Briggs hired
to look into this?

05:32.865 --> 05:35.068
Apparently she's not
a fan of your new detective.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.771
And for the record, as soon
as I get a job, I'm outta here.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.774
Oh, hey, you have a contact
at the Hamilton Precinct, right?

05:41.874 --> 05:44.077
Do you think you could
put in a good word for me?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.578
I'll babysit every time
I'm in town!

05:45.678 --> 05:47.413
That's a terrible deal!
You're never in town.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.581
I'll see what I can do.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.582
Thank you!

05:49.682 --> 05:50.817
Hey, hello?
Murder scene?

05:50.917 --> 05:53.152
Right.
So what's the story here?

05:56.522 --> 05:57.990
Come on, you're not
actually afraid of

05:58.091 --> 05:59.292
Joe Hardy boy, are you?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.761
No, no, I mean,
he is my supervisor

06:01.861 --> 06:05.498
and I have to at least pretend
to care about what he thinks.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.134
So, what do we know?

06:08.234 --> 06:09.969
Based on the mess,
it looks like someone was

06:10.069 --> 06:12.105
rifling through Marlina's files
and was surprised by Danny.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.940
A struggle ensued,
and they spilled into

06:14.040 --> 06:16.008
the kitchen and the pool,
where Danny was drowned.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.310
Mm.
What about that thing?

06:17.410 --> 06:18.945
Yeah...

06:19.045 --> 06:20.780
You'll be shocked to
learn the security cameras

06:20.880 --> 06:22.382
were turned off
during the incident.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.883
Any eyewitnesses?
Suspects?

06:23.983 --> 06:25.985
Only any of Marlina's
competitors.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.854
Three months ago, Marlina
started throwing around

06:27.954 --> 06:29.355
accusations of
corporate espionage.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.823
We didn't find any proof,

06:30.923 --> 06:32.725
but judging by the state
of this office,

06:32.825 --> 06:34.660
she might have been
onto something.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.496
Hmm.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.769
Maybe.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.337
Why does your face
look like that?

06:44.437 --> 06:45.805
What?
This is my thinking face.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.173
That's not
your thinking face.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.375
That's your
"something's off" face.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.445
Fine.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.917
It's just if you're willing
to make this much of a mess,

06:58.017 --> 06:59.619
in my opinion, you're
not concerned about

06:59.719 --> 07:00.987
people knowing
about the break-in.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.723
Okay...
Why not take the laptop?

07:03.823 --> 07:06.325
If it's corporate espionage,
hack into it later.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.127
Maybe they panicked
after the murder and bolted.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.395
Maybe.

07:09.495 --> 07:14.200
Officer Graham?

07:14.300 --> 07:17.003
Look, uh, do yourself a favour
and stay out of Harris' way.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.839
I don't know what he was like
before he got to Alder Bluffs,

07:19.939 --> 07:21.073
but he is dangerously insecure.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.978
Noted.

07:30.817 --> 07:31.884
Hmm...

07:33.820 --> 07:34.854
What did you find out?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.956
It's good to see you too, Mom.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.357
Geez.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.394
According to Zane, the cops
think it's corporate espionage.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.962
And according to you?

07:43.062 --> 07:44.197
I'm not entirely convinced.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.832
Exactly!
Think about it:

07:45.932 --> 07:48.868
Marlina is worth over
200 million dollars,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.504
and Danny was murdered
mere weeks before their

07:51.604 --> 07:53.706
un-prenupped union
became official.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.609
How does someone as successful
as Marlina not sign a prenup?

07:56.709 --> 07:58.044
I don't know.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.280
Abs make you do crazy things.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.382
So you think this
is about inheritance?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.718
I would bet the profits
of my last book on it.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.420
Ballpark those for me?

08:07.520 --> 08:11.557
A while back, Marlina's
last man-friend du jour

08:11.657 --> 08:13.259
started floating around
the word "marriage,"

08:13.359 --> 08:16.229
and you should have seen how
her three awful kids reacted!

08:16.329 --> 08:18.164
Sounds like we should
talk to them.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.932
Yeah, let's start with Noelle.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.602
She's the eldest and
arguably the most difficult.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.604
You two should
get along swimmingly!

08:28.574 --> 08:29.942
I don't understand.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.978
I thought the cops were looking
into Marlina's competitors.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.913
They are.
But we're not the cops.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.815
We're private investigators,
hired by your mother-in-law.

08:35.915 --> 08:37.116
Oh, makes sense.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.118
Hiring a washed-up
mystery writer to investigate

08:39.218 --> 08:40.219
does sound like Marlina.

08:40.319 --> 08:42.121
Nice.
That's very nice.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.223
So sorry.
My husband has a condition.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.625
He's a jackass.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.126
Are you alright, Noelle?

08:47.226 --> 08:48.594
You seem a little on edge.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.129
It's the caffeine.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.464
She's an addict.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.500
Actually, I'm VP Comms for
a billion-dollar pharmaceutical

08:54.600 --> 08:56.969
company and my mother's fiancé
was killed this morning,

08:57.069 --> 08:59.205
so I've been trying to handle
things in her absence.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.673
So, no,
everything is not alright.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.508
We're completing clinical trials
on a major new drug

09:02.608 --> 09:04.644
and our investors
don't really care much

09:04.744 --> 09:05.945
for personal drama, so...

09:06.045 --> 09:07.613
Mm-hm.
Where were you this morning

09:07.713 --> 09:09.148
between 9 and 10 am?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.149
What, are you serious?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.718
It's fine, Paul.
I was riding.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.587
I keep a horse over
at Blackwood Stables.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.023
I saw her leave
in her riding gear myself.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.724
Do you ride often?

09:18.824 --> 09:20.693
Every Tuesday
and Thursday morning.

09:20.793 --> 09:21.994
It keeps me sane.

09:22.094 --> 09:22.995
Hm.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.597
Look, I appreciate
you're doing your job,

09:24.697 --> 09:26.832
but what motive could I possibly
have for killing Danny?

09:26.933 --> 09:28.501
You don't want to share
your inheritance.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.136
Money can be a great motivator.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.370
Oh!

09:31.470 --> 09:34.040
Take a look around--
we're not exactly slumming it.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.709
I have to take this.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.844
But if the inheritance
has anything to do

09:38.945 --> 09:42.081
with Danny's murder, you should
talk to my sister, Andrea.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.118
This is Noelle...

09:57.663 --> 09:59.632
Of course
my sister would say that.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.500
But I don't want
my mother's money.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.469
How's business, Andrea?

10:03.569 --> 10:08.107
Photography slash kombucha,
it's a very niche market.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.775
Contrary to
my mother's philosophy,

10:09.875 --> 10:13.179
I chose to pursue my passions,
not the almighty dollar.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.413
And how did Marlina feel about

10:14.513 --> 10:16.048
you avoiding
the family business?

10:16.148 --> 10:18.451
I don't think she
was thrilled about it.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.252
But I wasn't thrilled
when she shacked up

10:20.353 --> 10:22.088
with a 12-year-old gigolo.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.422
But I try not to dwell.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.690
That's a little bit harsh.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.159
I take it you didn't
like young Danny?

10:27.259 --> 10:28.728
He was a hustler.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.731
Always looking for some
sucker to fund his stupid

10:31.831 --> 10:33.766
energy drink business venture.

10:33.866 --> 10:37.370
And then, quelle surprise, he's
captivated by an older woman

10:37.470 --> 10:40.039
who happens to own
a billion-dollar empire.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.874
It is a little on the nose.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.210
My mother was a fool
to fall for him.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.879
So no, I wasn't
a big fan of Danny's.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.582
And I assume you have
an alibi for this morning?

10:49.682 --> 10:52.218
I was preparing for
my upcoming photography show:

10:52.318 --> 10:53.619
"From Rich to Roughing It."

10:53.719 --> 10:56.756
So were you alone or ...?

10:56.856 --> 10:59.158
Yeah.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.293
You don't really think I did it.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.965
Why aren't you picking
on my brother, Silas?

11:06.065 --> 11:08.067
He had a massive screaming
fight on the phone

11:08.167 --> 11:09.769
when he was at my place
the other day.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.137
I'm pretty sure he said,
"Danny".

11:11.237 --> 11:12.238
What was the fight about?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.506
I don't know.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.075
Maybe Danny finally
found his sucker.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.677
It feels like we're done here.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.379
Unless you're gonna
finish that kombucha.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.748
Yeah, finish it, Mom.
We have time, thank you.

11:22.848 --> 11:23.783
I'm okay.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.785
Drink up!
I'll wait.

11:25.885 --> 11:26.852
Num num num!

11:28.954 --> 11:30.656
So, what do
we think about Andrea?

11:30.756 --> 11:32.958
Not much of an alibi, huh?

11:33.059 --> 11:36.762
And what about her throwing
her own brother under the bus?

11:36.862 --> 11:40.866
Of course, she's not big enough
to overpower bodybuilder Danny,

11:40.966 --> 11:45.971
but who's to say she didn't
hire someone else to do it?

11:46.072 --> 11:48.874
Feel free to jump in
anytime now, honey.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.610
Andrea was right about
Danny's business venture.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.213
I found a website
for his sugar-free energy drink.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.016
TurboSlam?

11:57.116 --> 11:59.618
Huh... I guess
he did have some investors.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.789
Wait, go back--
that's Marlina's son.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.259
"Angel investor" Silas Briggs.

12:11.030 --> 12:11.397
Because at TurboSlam,

12:13.299 --> 12:15.000
we slam you with
sugar-free energy!

12:15.101 --> 12:16.969
Every time!

12:17.069 --> 12:18.904
Woo!

12:19.004 --> 12:21.474
TurboSlam!

12:21.574 --> 12:23.309
So you found it.
And me.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.877
According to the website,

12:24.977 --> 12:28.013
you made a substantial
investment in TurboSlam.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.448
Two hundred and fifty grand.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.449
Wow.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.784
It was supposed
to go into R&D,

12:31.884 --> 12:34.453
but all Danny cared about
was rushing it to market.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.155
We didn't even
have a product yet

12:36.255 --> 12:38.657
and we had more social media
accounts than a teenager.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.926
We spoke to your sister, Andrea.
She said--

12:41.026 --> 12:43.095
I had an argument with
Danny three days ago?

12:43.195 --> 12:46.766
"Massive screaming fight"
were her words, but yes.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.068
Look, the narrative that
I'm a deadbeat has served

12:49.168 --> 12:51.604
both of my sisters
our entire lives.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.173
Noelle's the fancy VP
and successor to the throne.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.177
Andrea's the free thinker who
chose to blaze her own trail.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.514
And I'm the loser who can't be
trusted with the family wealth.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.350
So you didn't, say,
squander your mom's handouts

13:04.450 --> 13:07.253
with entitled abandon?

13:07.353 --> 13:10.656
Of course,
you're pals with my mom.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.625
I might have spent money
a little recklessly

13:12.725 --> 13:14.960
here and there,
but I didn't kill anyone.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.829
Out of curiosity,
where were you between

13:16.929 --> 13:18.297
9 and 10 am this morning?

13:18.397 --> 13:20.800
Out of curiosity?
Mm-hm.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.170
I was fishing, alone,
up at Lake Nipissing.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.838
I wanted to clear my head.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.773
No offence, but you don't
seem like the kind of guy

13:27.873 --> 13:30.042
who goes fishing
to clear his head.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.977
How do you suppose
I clear my head?

13:32.077 --> 13:36.715
Jell-O shots, dog fights,
mud-wrestling?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
Okay.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.953
You know the real irony?

13:41.053 --> 13:43.322
I thought that supporting
Danny would put me

13:43.422 --> 13:45.090
in my mom's good graces
for a change.

13:45.191 --> 13:48.961
Instead, I just gave my sisters
even more ammunition.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.202
What a little snot,

13:56.302 --> 13:58.337
giving us a sob story like that!

13:58.437 --> 14:02.241
I don't know,
part of me feels for the guy.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.210
Growing up with a mom
who prioritizes her work

14:04.310 --> 14:06.612
above all else
couldn't have been easy.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.280
Okay, what are you
trying to say?

14:08.380 --> 14:09.715
Nothing.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.784
Just that it's no wonder
he's made some

14:11.884 --> 14:13.919
questionable life choices.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.422
People do crazy things
to be seen and loved.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.524
Hmm, so true.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.626
What a monster his mother is.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.996
Of course, Silas has lived
a life of immeasurable privilege

14:24.096 --> 14:26.699
precisely because
of his mother's sacrifices.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.769
Sacrifices she made so that
he would want for nothing.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.739
Nothing but his mother.

14:33.839 --> 14:36.041
Speaking of wanting
for nothing,

14:36.141 --> 14:37.409
I'm just gonna make you dinner.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.647
Hello?

14:41.747 --> 14:43.582
Hey, Darbs,
how's it goin'?

14:43.682 --> 14:44.750
Oh, it's you.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.018
Ouch!

14:46.118 --> 14:47.653
No offence taken.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.121
Sorry, it was an unknown number.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.056
I thought it might be
the Hamilton Precinct.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.324
What's up?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.727
You sound like
you could use a drink.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.796
If it gets me out of here...

14:57.897 --> 15:01.901
I'll be there in ten.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.702
I'm making paella.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.805
I took a Catalonian
cooking class a month ago

15:06.906 --> 15:10.776
and I have been dying
to use these guajillo peppers.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.746
Oh, I just made a plan
to meet Zane for a drink.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.483
Sorry, I didn't know you
were doing a whole thing.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.884
Oh.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.452
Well, that's okay.
You have a life.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.487
You should live it.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.988
Great!

15:23.088 --> 15:25.257
Um, but do eat something
while you're out.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.358
Yeah, I will.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.193
Yeah, 'cause you're so pale.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.962
I said I would eat something!

15:30.062 --> 15:31.230
Okay.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.965
Go.
Have fun!

15:33.065 --> 15:35.968
Okay.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.810
I don't know
why I feel guilty.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.946
So she's eating dinner alone?
Big whoop!

15:47.046 --> 15:48.847
Do you know how many dinners
I had to eat alone

15:48.948 --> 15:51.016
when I was a kid because
she was off promoting some book

15:51.116 --> 15:52.217
at a book launch thing?

15:52.318 --> 15:53.519
I--

15:53.619 --> 15:55.154
It's like "Cat's in the Cradle"
and all that crap.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.022
I don't have to tell you.
You know my mom.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.123
You get it.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.559
Actually, I, uh...
gotta get this.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.362
Okay.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.168
You've gotta release some
of that resentment, Darby.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.436
It's not healthy.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.038
Honestly,
I don't even care anymore.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.974
Okay.
Got it, got it.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.510
But it sounds like
you do care a lot.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.913
And that's totally fine.

16:21.013 --> 16:23.716
People we love
always disappoint.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.651
Yeah, no kidding.

16:25.751 --> 16:29.221
Because our expectations
are too high.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.893
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

16:34.994 --> 16:39.064
Number one, you can wait for
Victoria to magically transform

16:39.164 --> 16:41.900
into someone
she's never gonna be,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.670
or, number two,

16:44.770 --> 16:48.874
you can let go of expectations.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.175
Third option?

16:50.275 --> 16:52.044
Eat your empanada.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.212
Okay.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.948
Your turn again.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.216
Hey.
Hey!

16:57.316 --> 16:58.484
What?

16:58.584 --> 16:59.585
Nothing.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.721
Oh, come on.
You're the world's worst liar.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.156
Is it about the case?

17:04.256 --> 17:05.758
This stuff's confidential, Darbs.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.594
You know I'll be more of a help
to you than Detective Harris.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.262
And you saw the crime scene.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.097
Admit it.
It was off.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.132
Yeah.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.433
How about a trade?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.435
I'll show you mine,
you show me yours.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.770
Disturbing.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.771
But I'm listening.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.406
Okay, get this.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.542
So, Marlina's son, Silas, had
an ugly blow-up with the victim

17:23.642 --> 17:24.977
the night before the murder.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.412
And his alibi that morning...?

17:26.512 --> 17:27.413
Yeah?

17:27.513 --> 17:29.615
Fishing alone.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.849
Now you.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.055
Yes, Sarita,
I'm working on it right now.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.222
Still at it?

17:37.322 --> 17:39.258
You and I really
need to get a life.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.994
So... feeling good
about the new pages?

17:42.094 --> 17:43.062
Oh, yeah.

17:43.162 --> 17:46.765
This new story is absolutely
riveting, it's...

17:46.865 --> 17:48.100
Terrific.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.003
We'll connect next week.
I can't wait to read them.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.639
Bye, love.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.842
I can't wait to
read them either.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.581
Oh!

18:02.681 --> 18:04.716
How could you sneak up
on a person like that?

18:04.817 --> 18:07.119
Since when is walking through
an open door sneaking?!

18:07.219 --> 18:09.154
Anyway,
the autopsy just came in.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.490
Apparently, there was
no water in Danny's lungs.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.825
He didn't drown.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.860
Well, how did he die?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.295
Cardiac arrest.

18:16.395 --> 18:17.362
But they don't know
what caused it,

18:17.463 --> 18:19.565
so they're running
additional tests.

18:19.665 --> 18:20.732
Drugs?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.334
Nothing in the tox report.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.335
Huh.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.938
So then what exactly
killed Danny?

18:26.038 --> 18:28.974
That is the $10,000 question.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.920
What the hell is this?

18:42.020 --> 18:43.255
It's a case board!

18:43.355 --> 18:44.723
It's what all the pros use.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.592
I'm the pros, Mom.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.860
And no, we don't.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.994
Well, I do.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.395
When I write,
I'm a visual thinker.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.564
I need to see all the pieces
in front of me.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.766
Okay, well, I need to see...

18:54.867 --> 18:55.767
coffee.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.002
So, I was thinking,

18:57.102 --> 18:58.137
if Danny didn't drown,

18:58.237 --> 18:59.771
perhaps he was placed
in the pool

18:59.872 --> 19:01.373
to throw the cops off the trail.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.010
But if there was nothing in
the tox report, how did he die?

19:07.813 --> 19:10.949
You can't test for something
you don't know to look for.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.885
Okay...

19:12.985 --> 19:14.353
Tox reports are effective,

19:14.453 --> 19:16.255
but a standard panel
only tests for about

19:16.355 --> 19:18.557
10 or 15 different drugs.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.859
How many drugs are currently
in development at Zanotec

19:20.959 --> 19:22.761
that forensics wouldn't
even know to look for?

19:22.861 --> 19:24.463
Wow, keep going.

19:24.563 --> 19:28.133
What if Danny died from a drug
that hasn't hit the market yet?

19:28.233 --> 19:29.568
Think about it.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.703
Someone could've stolen
a syringe from Zanotec,

19:31.803 --> 19:35.040
snuck up on Danny...
Boom!

19:35.140 --> 19:36.775
See, someone else
is a visual thinker!

19:36.875 --> 19:37.910
Hm.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.611
Well, how do we find
this mystery drug?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.380
We'd have to compare
Danny's blood report

19:41.480 --> 19:43.115
to the Zanotec clinical trials.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.383
We should talk to Marlina.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.251
No, no,
we are not talking to her.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.753
Why not?

19:47.853 --> 19:51.390
Because she's mourning
the loss of her fiancé.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.759
The prime suspects
are her children.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.162
What if she finds out that her
company's own drug killed him?

19:57.262 --> 19:59.064
No, we are not talking to her

19:59.164 --> 20:01.533
unless we are
100 percent certain.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.101
So then what
are we supposed to do?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.436
Start with the easy part.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.271
We get Danny's blood report
from the hospital morgue.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.140
That's the hard part, Mom!

20:08.240 --> 20:11.076
We don't have access
to the morgue.

20:11.176 --> 20:12.978
What...

20:13.078 --> 20:14.846
is that face?

20:23.855 --> 20:26.091
No, no, no.
Absolutely not!

20:26.191 --> 20:27.492
You're not posing as a doctor.

20:27.593 --> 20:28.760
Do you have a better idea?

20:28.860 --> 20:29.861
That's not the point!

20:29.962 --> 20:31.430
This is false impersonation
and it's illegal.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.699
Ugh!
Look, we are going to a morgue.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.134
Literally no one
wants to be there.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.703
You are so uptight.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.738
That's what living in the city
does to a person.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.140
Your nervous system
is just all out of whack.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.642
You have to see
my acupuncturist.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.310
I don't need
an acupuncturist!

20:45.410 --> 20:46.845
Fine, suit yourself.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.947
But you have to
take your cop cap off

20:49.047 --> 20:52.351
and start thinking like a PI.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.819
Fine.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.954
But if we get arrested,
you're covering bail.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.256
No problem, I'm rich.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.191
I don't know why
you're so confident right now.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.359
This is a small town.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.095
Anyone could see us.
What if we bump into Lucas?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.596
Is that wishful thinking,
I hear?

21:04.696 --> 21:05.998
No, it's anxiety.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.301
Oh, no, it's just
because you are pushing 30

21:09.401 --> 21:11.103
and the most eligible
bachelor in town.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.371
The most eligible bachelor
in town?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.539
This isn't
a Jane Austen novel, Mom.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.808
And he's not eligible
because he's engaged.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.143
That doesn't mean anything.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.378
Stop being so pedantic.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.446
Besides, if he shows up,
just cover for me.

21:21.546 --> 21:22.814
How am I supposed to cover?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.816
Uh, use your imagination?

21:24.916 --> 21:26.285
Distract him?

21:26.385 --> 21:27.319
Flirt?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.354
Ugh!
Hi, this is reality!

21:29.454 --> 21:31.923
I can't just beguile him
with my powers of seduction.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.359
Not with that attitude,
you can't.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.360
Besides, I'm not worried.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.029
What are the chances
we bump into him?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.797
Darby?

21:38.897 --> 21:42.334
You've gotta be kidding me.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.504
Lucas!

21:45.604 --> 21:47.239
Hey!
Hi, how are you?

21:47.339 --> 21:49.041
Good!
Is that your mom?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.442
What?
No!

21:50.542 --> 21:52.844
Who?
What, stop.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.414
Busy day?

21:58.784 --> 21:59.718
Excuse me.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.919
Oh!
Uh...

22:01.019 --> 22:03.555
I am a visiting
pathologist from Chicago.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.058
I don't know where
the hell my ID badge is,

22:06.158 --> 22:11.096
but I am working with cadavers
studying the effects of RISRs,

22:11.196 --> 22:13.932
radiation-induced
skin reactions,

22:14.032 --> 22:16.735
and their effect
on DNA mutations.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.137
The X and the Ys,
the chromosomes.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.740
Sorry,
I don't really understand.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.109
I'm so sorry.
I just... I go on and on.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.611
I... I get overzealous
about my research.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.449
But, you know, with radiation
therapy so prevalent these days,

22:30.549 --> 22:32.718
and if I could just change
one life with my work,

22:32.818 --> 22:33.852
it would be--

22:33.952 --> 22:36.254
My wife is actually
going through it right now.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.956
Oh, really?
I'm so sorry.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.558
What are you doing here?

22:39.658 --> 22:42.594
Um, I'm here waiting for my mom.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.429
Who isn't here... yet.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.632
She will be because
she's researching a new novel.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.234
It's a medical mystery.

22:49.334 --> 22:50.369
How's she doing?

22:50.469 --> 22:51.603
It's a struggle every day.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.438
Is it?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.440
That's why my work
is so important.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.408
Right.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.343
It could affect
your wife or anyone.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.811
Oh, anything I can help with?

22:59.911 --> 23:01.246
Uh, I don't think so,

23:01.346 --> 23:03.648
because it has to do with... obstetrics.

23:03.749 --> 23:04.783
Mm.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.518
It's a classic who-done-it, huh?

23:06.618 --> 23:07.686
Yeah!

23:07.786 --> 23:09.755
Obstetrics
is on the fifth floor.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.990
Right.
I'll see you later.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.860
Alright.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.595
Guess I got turned around.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.997
Yeah, it reminds me of that
trip we took to Wasaga Beach

23:19.097 --> 23:20.399
where you insisted
on navigating.

23:20.499 --> 23:23.502
Hey, those exit signs
were invisible to the naked eye!

23:23.602 --> 23:25.937
Sure they were.

23:26.037 --> 23:28.640
Gimme a second, I gotta check
on something in the morgue.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.741
Okay.
No, no, no, no!

23:29.841 --> 23:30.942
Um...
Wait.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.144
How's Lindsay?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.845
I've been meaning to ask.

23:33.945 --> 23:34.946
Great.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.415
She's busy with
the wedding prep mostly.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.516
I'll bet.

23:37.616 --> 23:38.784
Exciting!

23:38.884 --> 23:41.987
Yeah.
I mean, it's all a bit much...

23:42.087 --> 23:43.188
to be honest.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.990
You know me, it's just...

23:45.090 --> 23:46.691
KISS!

23:46.792 --> 23:47.793
What?

23:47.893 --> 23:50.295
Keep It Simple Stupid.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.165
Nothing extravagant.
You're a simple guy.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.534
Thank you.

23:55.634 --> 23:56.902
No, you're right.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.137
Um, as long as she's happy,

23:59.237 --> 24:01.540
the day does seem to be mostly
about the bride... right?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.974
Hmm, I dunno.

24:03.074 --> 24:07.979
Isn't it just as much
about the groom?

24:25.931 --> 24:27.232
Martinez...

24:27.332 --> 24:29.568
Moore...

24:29.668 --> 24:31.570
Danny Moreau.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.138
Gotcha!

24:42.047 --> 24:43.915
Now I'm starting
to feel, you know,

24:44.015 --> 24:46.084
like I'm a guest
at my own party.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.587
Have you talked to Lindsay
about that?

24:48.687 --> 24:50.655
No, I should, shouldn't I?

24:50.755 --> 24:51.690
Yeah.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.833
Hello.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.237
This is nice.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.571
It's like old times.

25:06.671 --> 25:10.542
Sort of like old times.

25:10.642 --> 25:11.810
I gotta go.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.811
Okay.

25:12.911 --> 25:14.412
But we should, um...

25:14.513 --> 25:15.881
Let's have coffee, or, you know,

25:15.981 --> 25:17.415
somewhere other than
a hospital hallway?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.718
Yeah.
No, I'd love that, definitely.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.453
Okay.
Okay.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.522
Elevators are that way.

25:23.622 --> 25:24.489
Right.

25:24.589 --> 25:25.891
Thank you.

25:25.991 --> 25:26.925
Look for the signs.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.560
Yes.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.695
Not the exit signs.

25:30.795 --> 25:33.164
Right?

25:38.703 --> 25:39.738
You got it?

25:39.838 --> 25:41.139
Whoa, I can't believe
that worked!

25:41.239 --> 25:43.642
All it takes is confidence
and a few key acronyms.

25:43.742 --> 25:44.643
Works every time.

25:44.743 --> 25:45.777
Huh, alright.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.245
Well, we've got
Danny's blood report.

25:47.345 --> 25:49.414
Now we have to evaluate it
against all the drugs

25:49.514 --> 25:50.582
Zanotec has in clinical trials.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.017
That could be dozens of drugs!

25:52.117 --> 25:54.352
I know, which is why,
and I cannot stress this enough,

25:54.452 --> 25:55.754
we need to talk to Marlina.

25:55.854 --> 25:57.923
I already told you!
We're not talking to Marlina.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.658
But... I've got a better idea.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.600
Ugh, take it easy!

26:08.700 --> 26:09.901
Slow down!

26:10.001 --> 26:13.171
Oh, relax, we got
here in one piece, didn't we?

26:13.271 --> 26:17.175
I feel like there should
be a higher bar than that.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.911
Where are we, anyway?

26:24.215 --> 26:25.884
This is your better idea?

26:25.984 --> 26:28.086
Trust me!

26:31.222 --> 26:33.625
What the hell is this place?

26:33.725 --> 26:36.595
You'll see.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.336
Mom?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.972
Mom...

26:49.074 --> 26:50.208
So, let me get this straight,

26:50.308 --> 26:51.876
you want me to hack into
Zanotec's database

26:51.977 --> 26:53.812
and find a drug
that matches this random,

26:53.912 --> 26:55.246
unknown substance right here?

26:55.347 --> 26:56.514
Precisely.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.983
Is this for a book?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.819
Um... yes?

27:00.919 --> 27:03.188
I know you well enough to know
when you're lying, Victoria.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.222
Hard pass.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.690
We totally understand.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.492
And you know me
well enough to know

27:07.592 --> 27:09.327
that I can't turn down
a challenge!

27:09.427 --> 27:11.830
So if it's a biometric
security system,

27:11.930 --> 27:13.632
I'll need to harvest
the unsecured images

27:13.732 --> 27:15.667
with the scanner
or find a back door,

27:15.767 --> 27:17.335
which... that may take
a little bit more time.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.638
So if you'll excuse me...
okay?

27:19.738 --> 27:21.506
Okay.
Alright.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.708
Hey, come here!

27:23.808 --> 27:25.443
Do you maybe want
to explain this?

27:25.543 --> 27:27.078
Alastair?
Yeah!

27:27.178 --> 27:28.680
He's been
my consultant for years.

27:28.780 --> 27:31.216
How else do you think I wrote
"The Hacker's Handwriting"

27:31.316 --> 27:34.185
or "The Technician's Tirade"?

27:34.285 --> 27:35.720
It's all above board.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.789
Whose board?

27:37.889 --> 27:39.057
Fine, whatever.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.693
But it would have been a hell
of a lot cheaper and easier

27:41.793 --> 27:42.827
if we just talked to Marlina.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.129
Even if she is in mourning.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.363
Disagree!

27:45.463 --> 27:46.798
I don't understand.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.867
Wouldn't she want to help us
considering she's the one

27:48.967 --> 27:50.402
who hired us in the first place?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.771
I mean, for God's sake,
the woman is paying us

27:52.871 --> 27:55.573
ten grand to do this.

27:57.642 --> 28:01.146
She isn't paying us
ten grand, is she?

28:01.246 --> 28:03.615
She will...
I'm almost sure of it.

28:03.715 --> 28:06.251
Did she even hire us at all?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.753
Well, she didn't protest
when I offered our services.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.723
You off...
Oh my God.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.125
You offered.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.593
I'm so dumb.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.128
I can't believe I fell for this.

28:17.228 --> 28:19.931
Well, in your defence,
I can be quite convincing, so--

28:20.031 --> 28:22.767
Am I a joke to you?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.969
Am I just a little toy
that you play with?

28:25.070 --> 28:27.405
No, I-- no!
What are you talking about?

28:27.505 --> 28:29.708
What was all of this about, Mom?

28:29.808 --> 28:31.843
Is this just some twisted
attempt to keep me

28:31.943 --> 28:33.545
from going back to the city?

28:33.645 --> 28:36.081
You bribe me with ten grand
to trap me here?

28:36.181 --> 28:40.952
To alleviate the boredom
of your sad, lonely life?

28:41.052 --> 28:44.289
You're unbelievable.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.226
Darby!

29:00.805 --> 29:02.240
It's classic Mom.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.442
Every time I think things
could be different, maybe,

29:04.542 --> 29:06.211
she just reverts back to type.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.846
Well, well, well,

29:07.946 --> 29:11.082
still hanging on
to expectations, are we?

29:11.182 --> 29:13.017
Surrender, Darby.

29:13.118 --> 29:14.419
Surrender...

29:14.519 --> 29:17.756
Like, she made me go to this
shady hacker's warehouse

29:17.856 --> 29:20.725
to try to illegally breach--

29:20.825 --> 29:22.594
Never mind.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.562
Okay...?

29:24.662 --> 29:27.198
I just need to put miles
between me and her.

29:27.298 --> 29:29.067
We're too different.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.568
Speaking of which,
have you heard from

29:30.668 --> 29:32.403
the Hamilton Precinct contact?

29:32.504 --> 29:33.738
She hasn't called me yet.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.740
She's probably just busy.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.442
Right.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.111
You know,
your mother is a lot of things.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.746
A bit of a narcissist... Yeah.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.548
A neat freak,
a complete over-sharer.

29:43.648 --> 29:44.749
Definitely.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.252
But she isn't the monster
you make her out to be.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.888
She's willing to pay ten grand
just to spend time with you.

29:49.988 --> 29:54.559
It's low-key sad,
but also kind of sweet.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.427
I'm gonna tell you something,

29:56.528 --> 29:58.496
and I don't want
you to take it badly.

29:58.596 --> 29:59.564
Okay...?

29:59.664 --> 30:01.132
You have to promise
not to freak out.

30:01.232 --> 30:02.167
I'm scared.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.101
Swear it.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.836
Okay, God!
I won't freak out.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.838
Okay.

30:06.938 --> 30:11.910
I think you and Vic are a lot
more alike than you think.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.244
Okay, I'm freaking out a little.

30:13.344 --> 30:14.445
I'm serious.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.748
You both are smart, headstrong,
and opinionated.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.483
Maybe the problem isn't
that you're too different.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.751
It's that you're too--

30:19.851 --> 30:23.955
Do not finish that sentence.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.690
I gotta go.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.125
It's probably for the best.

30:27.225 --> 30:30.261
But, you know, you might want
to give your mother a break.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.096
Oh, by the way,
I looked into Silas.

30:32.197 --> 30:33.598
Remember,
you didn't hear this from me,

30:33.698 --> 30:34.699
but his alibi checks out.

30:34.799 --> 30:35.767
It does?

30:35.867 --> 30:37.769
Morning of the murder,
he swiped his credit card

30:37.869 --> 30:40.038
at a gas station 20 klicks
from Lake Nipissing.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.439
Huh!
Seriously.

30:41.539 --> 30:43.441
Weird.
Yeah.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.410
Thanks!
Yeah.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.959
Hey, Mom.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.794
Darby.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.630
Listen, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry for earlier.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.999
I... I may have overreacted

31:08.099 --> 31:11.269
and said some things
that I didn't really mean.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.672
But I've had a really
crazy week, as you can imagine.

31:14.772 --> 31:17.475
Or maybe you can't, because
you're not a 29-year-old,

31:17.575 --> 31:20.278
grown-ass woman with no job
who has to wake up every morning

31:20.378 --> 31:22.881
at her mother's house
in a graveyard of broken dreams,

31:22.981 --> 31:27.619
to the sight of a shirtless
teen werewolf staring at her.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.953
We can take the poster down.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.723
It's not about the poster.

31:36.361 --> 31:40.365
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

31:40.465 --> 31:43.568
I am sorry that this
has been so painful for you,

31:43.668 --> 31:46.437
but having you here has been
the highlight of my year.

31:51.276 --> 31:54.312
Maybe I shouldn't
have strung you along,

31:54.412 --> 31:56.514
but if it's any consolation,

31:56.614 --> 32:01.252
you have terrific
investigative instincts.

32:01.352 --> 32:04.322
I got a text from Alastair.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.424
Turns out your theory
was bang-on.

32:06.524 --> 32:07.458
Really?

32:07.558 --> 32:09.093
Did he hack into
Zanotec's database?

32:09.193 --> 32:10.395
Mm-hm!

32:10.495 --> 32:12.563
And one of the drug profiles
seems to match

32:12.664 --> 32:14.799
an unknown substance
in Danny's blood.

32:14.899 --> 32:18.336
Something called Troactis.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.737
Well...

32:19.837 --> 32:22.173
Okay, fine,
we can talk to Marlina now.

32:26.577 --> 32:27.679
I... I don't
understand.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.548
Where did you get these
chromatography reports from?

32:30.648 --> 32:33.918
Well, we may have taken
a slightly unorthodox approach,

32:34.018 --> 32:36.888
but I assure you we are the
only ones who have seen this.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.923
The point is, the unknown
substance in Danny's blood

32:39.023 --> 32:41.092
is a perfect match to Troactis.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.294
Someone injected it,
but in a much higher quantity

32:43.394 --> 32:44.963
than your clinical trial.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.864
Is it possible
that's what killed him?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.367
No.
No, absolutely not.

32:49.467 --> 32:52.103
Troactis was developed to treat
asthma sufferers of all ages.

32:52.203 --> 32:53.271
It's incredibly safe.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.539
Are you sure?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.474
We were on the verge of
submitting our final report

32:56.574 --> 32:57.942
to the Ministry of Health.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.478
The only thing holding us back
was the drug's adverse effects

33:00.578 --> 33:01.913
in...

33:02.013 --> 33:03.748
In...?

33:03.848 --> 33:07.285
People with type 1 diabetes.

33:07.385 --> 33:10.421
Danny's was so under control,
you'd barely know he had it.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.457
Danny was diabetic?

33:12.557 --> 33:15.960
He had to inject himself
daily with insulin.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.162
God knows what effects
a massive dose of Troactis

33:18.262 --> 33:20.465
would have done.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.899
What does this mean?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.602
I-I...

33:24.702 --> 33:26.604
I'm s--
I'm sorry.

33:26.704 --> 33:30.174
Excuse me.

33:30.274 --> 33:33.378
Marlina, I...

33:33.478 --> 33:35.546
Someone with type 1 diabetes
"under control"

33:35.646 --> 33:38.116
would generally avoid
copious amounts of sugar, right?

33:38.216 --> 33:40.018
Of course.
Why do you ask?

33:40.118 --> 33:42.387
Come with me.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.689
Do you have any idea how much
sugar there is in these things?

33:44.789 --> 33:46.124
Well, a massive amount.

33:46.224 --> 33:49.027
Maybe that's why Danny was
developing that TurboSlam drink.

33:49.127 --> 33:51.162
There was one open
on the workout bike

33:51.262 --> 33:52.864
the morning of Danny's murder.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.832
If Danny wasn't drinking it,
who was?

33:54.932 --> 33:56.534
That is a good question.

33:56.634 --> 34:00.304
Do you think Marlina will let us
look at her security footage?

34:00.405 --> 34:02.807
Whoever killed Danny
knew he had type 1 diabetes,

34:02.907 --> 34:04.642
and had access
to not only Troactis

34:04.742 --> 34:06.144
but to the test results.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.513
Showing the
adverse interaction, sure.

34:08.613 --> 34:09.981
But what does this prove?

34:10.081 --> 34:12.550
We already know that the cameras
were turned off on Thursday.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.018
I'm not interested in Thursday.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.186
I'm interested in Tuesday.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.988
Okay, what happened on Tuesday?

34:17.088 --> 34:18.222
Check it out.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.825
The camera was also turned off
on Tuesday morning,

34:20.925 --> 34:22.660
from 9 am to 10.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.863
And on the Thursday before that.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.331
And the previous Tuesday.

34:27.432 --> 34:28.866
And so on, and so on.

34:28.966 --> 34:32.270
Every Tuesday and Thursday
between 9 and 10 am?

34:32.370 --> 34:33.905
Energy drinks
are full of sugar,

34:34.005 --> 34:36.574
but they're also
chock-full of caffeine.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.710
Know any hopped-up caffeine
addicts who keep a suspiciously

34:39.811 --> 34:41.379
similar morning schedule?

34:41.479 --> 34:45.083
Oh, Marlina's daughter, Noelle.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.419
Looks like she was
never at the stable.

34:48.519 --> 34:51.389
She was riding
a different kind of stallion.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.292
Why... must you?

34:56.260 --> 34:56.561
ibly think that

34:56.561 --> 34:56.828
ibly think
that I killed Danny.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.765
This is crazy!

35:00.865 --> 35:02.166
Is it?

35:02.266 --> 35:04.836
You knew he had diabetes and
you had access to the studies.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.270
Because I work there.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.272
We checked the logs
at Blackwood Stables.

35:08.372 --> 35:09.974
There's no record
of you signing in

35:10.074 --> 35:11.843
every Tuesday and Thursday
morning for months.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.145
Coincidentally, those are
the same times that Danny

35:14.245 --> 35:16.247
turned off the home
security cameras.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.816
Now, what could
that possibly mean?

35:18.916 --> 35:21.219
Fine.
Okay, you're right.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.221
I wasn't at the stables.

35:23.321 --> 35:25.056
I was with Danny.

35:25.156 --> 35:28.326
But I-I swear
he was alive when I left.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.695
I mean, why would I kill him?

35:30.795 --> 35:32.530
I don't know,
maybe he wanted to call it off.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.565
Maybe he threatened
to tell your poor mother

35:34.665 --> 35:37.001
about your torrid affair.

35:37.101 --> 35:39.737
Danny and I were good.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.205
It's easy to feel like
you're never enough

35:41.305 --> 35:43.274
with a mother like mine.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.309
But with Danny?

35:45.409 --> 35:48.779
It was just the way
he looked at me.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.316
It was like I was
the only person in the world.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.051
We called Zanotec.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.355
Your key card was swiped in
the research lab at 10:48 pm

35:57.455 --> 35:58.489
the night before Danny's murder.

35:58.589 --> 35:59.891
That's impossible.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.425
That's when you got your hands
on the drug that killed him.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.760
No, it isn't,

36:02.860 --> 36:04.929
because I wasn't
at the lab on Wednesday night.

36:05.029 --> 36:09.467
I was at the club celebrating
my girlfriend's 40th.

36:09.567 --> 36:10.868
I bought a round of drinks.

36:10.968 --> 36:13.337
There's at least a dozen
people who can vouch for me.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.842
So, do you believe her?

36:17.942 --> 36:20.077
It's an easy alibi
to look into.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.146
Honestly, I just think
she's too smart to be

36:22.246 --> 36:23.548
that bad of a liar.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.684
Well, someone
swiped that keycard!

36:29.253 --> 36:31.689
Someone sure did...

36:35.092 --> 36:37.628
Oh great,
Miss Marple and Nancy Drew.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.564
Are you here to harass
my wife some more?

36:39.664 --> 36:41.799
Actually,
we'd rather harass you.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.902
You didn't happen to borrow
Noelle's company keycard

36:45.002 --> 36:46.370
on Wednesday evening, did you?

36:46.470 --> 36:48.139
No, I didn't.
What is this about?

36:48.239 --> 36:50.775
Troactis, the new drug
Noelle's company was developing.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.511
You knew all about it and its
effects on type 1 diabetics.

36:53.611 --> 36:54.946
What are you talking about?

36:55.046 --> 36:58.282
You also knew that your wife
was having an affair with Danny,

36:58.382 --> 37:01.485
so you stole a massive
amount of Troactis

37:01.586 --> 37:04.155
and you followed her Thursday
morning when she left.

37:04.255 --> 37:06.157
And then you hid
outside Danny's,

37:06.257 --> 37:07.458
waiting for Noelle to leave.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.260
And you knew
that the security cameras

37:09.360 --> 37:11.929
would be turned off.
Or you were too angry to care.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.297
And that's when you went inside,

37:13.397 --> 37:15.833
and when Danny's back was turned
you jabbed him with the syringe

37:15.933 --> 37:16.968
you stole from the lab.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.803
And then in order
to cover your tracks,

37:18.903 --> 37:20.504
you dragged Danny's
body into the pool

37:20.605 --> 37:22.206
and made it look
like a break-in.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.174
Are we close here?

37:23.274 --> 37:25.109
No, no, no, no.
None of this is true.

37:25.209 --> 37:26.611
Okay, well,
how about if we check

37:26.711 --> 37:28.312
the security cameras at Zanotec?

37:28.412 --> 37:30.948
Or if we told Forensics
to dust the keycard for prints,

37:31.048 --> 37:33.618
we wouldn't find yours?

37:37.221 --> 37:38.756
Oh, okay.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.958
Wow.
Um, I guess I'm going after him?

37:41.058 --> 37:42.660
I'm more of a pilates gal, hon.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.661
Argh!

37:43.761 --> 37:45.029
Ah!
Ow...

37:45.129 --> 37:47.231
Okay, hold this.

37:47.331 --> 37:48.666
Call Zane!

37:48.766 --> 37:49.700
Will do.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.036
Oh, don't even
think about it!

37:52.136 --> 37:54.739
Hey, Zane.
Man down.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.544
Thank you, Antonio,
it was so delicious.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.113
So good!
Hey, gang.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.514
Hey!
Hey!

38:03.614 --> 38:05.483
News report:
Paul was taken to hospital.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.617
Ankle sprain.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.452
Well, that will have
plenty of time to heal

38:08.552 --> 38:10.721
when Detective Harris charges
him with Danny's murder.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.990
Yeah, about that, you two
should lay low for a while.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.091
Harris is--

38:14.191 --> 38:17.261
There you are,
Miss Spencer!

38:17.361 --> 38:19.997
To what do we owe the honour,
Detective Harris?

38:20.097 --> 38:21.866
I just came from the hospital.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.834
Your little antics blew up
my investigation

38:23.934 --> 38:26.604
and now the suspect
is lawyering up.

38:26.704 --> 38:29.473
Well, then, congratulations!

38:29.573 --> 38:30.808
On what?

38:30.908 --> 38:34.445
Well, that must mean you have
ample evidence against him.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.580
Like Noelle's confession
that she was having

38:36.681 --> 38:38.916
an affair with Danny, right?

38:39.016 --> 38:40.151
Right.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.219
Yeah, well, that would make
Paul the natural suspect.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.488
But without any hard evidence,
we can't actually charge him.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.190
Like his prints
all over the lab?

38:46.290 --> 38:48.592
Which you already had Officer
Graham dust for, I'm sure.

38:48.693 --> 38:49.894
There's a team there now.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.128
DARBY Great call!
Mm-hm!

38:51.228 --> 38:52.630
Because obviously,
Paul doesn't have clearance

38:52.730 --> 38:55.132
to access Zanotec's lab,
only his wife does.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.802
But I'm not telling you
anything you don't already know!

38:57.902 --> 38:58.903
Of course.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.271
No, that's, um...

39:00.371 --> 39:01.539
That's good.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.308
Good work, Officer Graham,
following my orders.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.210
And if all else fails,
you can always check

39:06.310 --> 39:08.746
Zanotec's security cameras
on Wednesday night.

39:08.846 --> 39:12.116
I'm sure you'll find them
tremendously revealing.

39:12.216 --> 39:14.385
Well, we're already on that!

39:14.485 --> 39:15.920
Mm-hm.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.022
Wow, you move fast!

39:18.122 --> 39:19.290
Mm-hm!
Well done!

39:19.390 --> 39:20.758
Ha!

39:20.858 --> 39:22.793
You know, it's funny, though,
how quickly you veered away

39:22.893 --> 39:24.462
from the obvious COD.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.262
COD?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.764
Oh yeah,
it's cause of death.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.132
No one says COD.

39:28.232 --> 39:29.633
Yes, they do.

39:29.734 --> 39:30.935
People say that.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.636
Okay, wait,
you and Officer Graham,

39:32.737 --> 39:34.438
you guys are friends, right?

39:34.538 --> 39:35.740
We know each other.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.475
Hmm, and he didn't
happen to feed you

39:37.575 --> 39:39.510
confidential information on,
say, well, I don't know,

39:39.610 --> 39:41.412
an autopsy report, now did he?

39:41.512 --> 39:44.115
Absolutely not, Detective.
I would never do such a thing.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.750
It would be unethical.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.953
Hmm, wow.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.756
Seems like your talents
transcend the written word,

39:51.856 --> 39:54.258
Miss Spencer, and...

39:54.358 --> 39:56.961
I don't think we've
actually met yet, have we?

39:57.061 --> 39:58.462
My goodness,
how rude of me!

39:58.562 --> 40:02.266
Detective Harris, this is
my daughter, Darby Spencer.

40:02.366 --> 40:03.701
Daughter?

40:03.801 --> 40:07.171
Wow, I had you
pegged as sisters.

40:07.271 --> 40:08.839
Ugh!

40:08.939 --> 40:11.542
Surrender!

40:20.718 --> 40:22.386
So, dinner later?

40:22.486 --> 40:23.521
Paella?

40:23.621 --> 40:24.722
I'd love that.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.957
The saffron would do wonders
for your blood sugar.

40:27.057 --> 40:29.160
My blood sugar thanks you.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.896
You know, honey, I can't stop
thinking that solving one case

40:31.996 --> 40:33.397
might be a fluke, but two--

40:33.497 --> 40:36.500
Don't say it.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.438
I'm pretty sure that's
what they call "on a roll."

40:40.538 --> 40:41.572
What are these?

40:41.672 --> 40:43.274
Just something
to think about.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.409
"The Spencer Sisters
Detective Agency"?

40:45.509 --> 40:47.778
When did you have time
to get these made?

40:47.878 --> 40:53.017
Oh yeah, and Marlina
did end up paying us after all.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.953
You've gotta be kidding me!
20,000?

40:56.053 --> 40:59.123
Seems like I underestimated
her gratitude.

40:59.223 --> 41:00.724
But this was a team effort, Mom.

41:00.825 --> 41:02.827
Half of this is yours.

41:02.927 --> 41:06.697
Okay, I'll take it, but...

41:06.797 --> 41:11.268
I'm gonna put my half
back into the business.

41:11.368 --> 41:13.637
If there is a business.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.443
Alright.
We'll give it a shot.

41:19.543 --> 41:21.212
On a trial basis.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.379
We'll see how it goes.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.483
Okay, we'll see how it goes.
