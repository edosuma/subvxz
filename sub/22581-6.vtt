WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:05.088
This was their first view of it.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.758
If you don't look too close,
you'd think it was Earth.

00:08.132 --> 00:11.011
Breaking ground on the town hall.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.347
Is that Captain Mitchell?

00:13.805 --> 00:16.767
No, I think that's Mitchell.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.852
Are we there yet?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.980
Three hours, 17 minutes to go, sir.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.483
Travis has been digging
through the archives.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.318
There's tons of data here:

00:26.735 --> 00:28.653
Crew manifests,

00:28.862 --> 00:30.989
survey photos,

00:31.198 --> 00:32.741
weekly status reports.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.160
I was hoping to find something,

00:35.410 --> 00:36.912
a clue to what happened.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.622
You'd be the first.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.541
I've been fascinated by Terra Nova
since I was a kid, sir.

00:41.791 --> 00:45.420
I always thought lost colonies affected
boomers more than anyone else.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.423
Something about people
who choose to live off-world.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.551
Captain,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.970
do you think anyone's still there?

00:54.846 --> 00:56.306
I'll let you know...

00:56.514 --> 00:58.808
...in about three hours
and 17 minutes.

01:04.397 --> 01:09.736
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:12.197 --> 01:15.617
"It's been a long time"

01:15.825 --> 01:19.662
"But my time is finally near"

01:19.871 --> 01:24.125
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:24.334 --> 01:27.253
"I will touch the sky"

01:27.462 --> 01:31.257
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:31.466 --> 01:34.469
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:34.677 --> 01:39.390
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:39.599 --> 01:42.518
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:42.727 --> 01:47.315
"I've got faith to believe"

01:47.523 --> 01:50.109
"I can do anything"

01:50.318 --> 01:54.822
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:55.031 --> 01:57.909
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:58.117 --> 02:03.456
"I can reach any star"

02:03.831 --> 02:07.585
"I've got faith"

02:07.793 --> 02:11.505
"I've got faith"

02:11.714 --> 02:16.510
"Faith of the heart"

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:27.521 --> 02:29.982
- Terra Nova?
- I'm surprised you've never heard of it.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.650
I'm not familiar with the early years

02:33.068 --> 02:35.237
- of human space exploration.
- Really?

02:35.446 --> 02:38.991
Every schoolkid on Earth had to learn
about the famous Vulcan expeditions.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.659
Name one.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.876
History was never my best subject.

02:49.585 --> 02:51.420
It was called the Great Experiment.

02:51.628 --> 02:53.964
Could humans colonise deep space?

02:54.173 --> 02:56.091
They'd already built New Berlin
on the Moon,

02:56.300 --> 02:58.469
Utopia Planetia on Mars,

02:58.677 --> 03:00.387
even a few asteroid colonies,

03:00.596 --> 03:02.598
but all within our solar system.

03:02.890 --> 03:06.226
When they found an Earth-like planet
less than 20 light years away,

03:06.435 --> 03:07.603
it was hard to resist.

03:07.811 --> 03:09.521
It took them, what,
nine years to get there?

03:09.730 --> 03:12.524
Nine years there, nine years back,
but they made it.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.027
My grandfather remembered
seeing their first transmissions

03:15.235 --> 03:18.196
- when he was a kid.
- What happened to them?

03:19.114 --> 03:23.076
People have been trying to answer
that question for a long time.

03:23.285 --> 03:26.830
No one's heard from Terra Nova
in over 70 years.

03:27.330 --> 03:31.084
After the colony was built,
relations with Earth became strained.

03:31.334 --> 03:33.670
The Space Agency figured
nothing succeeds like success,

03:33.879 --> 03:35.380
so they decided to send
another vessel.

03:35.672 --> 03:36.798
The colonists protested.

03:37.007 --> 03:38.967
They'd been there five years.
This was their home.

03:39.176 --> 03:41.011
They didn't want
another 200 people arriving.

03:41.219 --> 03:43.680
The folks back on Earth argued
that there weren't any other

03:43.889 --> 03:46.141
habitable planets within reach.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.768
But the colonists dug their heels in.

03:48.977 --> 03:53.940
There were a few angry messages
sent back and forth, then one day...

03:55.358 --> 03:56.860
...nobody heard from them again.

03:57.277 --> 03:59.612
Why didn't you send a vessel
to find out what happened?

03:59.988 --> 04:01.740
Nine years there, nine years back.

04:01.948 --> 04:03.908
It would have been a pretty long trip.

04:04.117 --> 04:06.995
A Vulcan ship could have made
the journey in far less time.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.580
Why didn't you ask them?

04:09.748 --> 04:13.835
Asking favours of the Vulcans usually
ends up carrying too high a price.

04:14.502 --> 04:16.838
My experience with humans
is limited...

04:17.046 --> 04:20.257
...but I've come to learn
that they're quite resourceful.

04:20.925 --> 04:23.386
Terra Nova may still be there, captain.

04:36.607 --> 04:38.693
Two hundred thousand kilometres.

04:38.901 --> 04:40.486
Let's see it.

04:45.783 --> 04:48.995
I promised my dad
I'd see this place someday.

04:49.454 --> 04:51.914
Put us in orbit over the colony.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.423
Terra Nova Colony,

05:00.631 --> 05:03.926
this is Captain Jonathan Archer
of the starship Enterprise.

05:04.135 --> 05:07.346
We've come from Earth.
Please respond.

05:10.933 --> 05:12.184
No answer, sir.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.395
Any bio-signs?

05:17.982 --> 05:21.277
No. But the colony
appears to be intact.

05:21.485 --> 05:23.988
I'm also detecting low levels
of surface radiation.

05:24.196 --> 05:25.739
From what?

05:25.948 --> 05:27.491
I can't tell.

05:31.245 --> 05:32.872
Let's take a look.

05:37.501 --> 05:38.919
Closer.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.173
Looks like a ghost town.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.677
Let's hope the ghosts
can give us some answers.

05:47.011 --> 05:49.638
- How bad is the radiation?
- Less than 800 millirads.

05:49.847 --> 05:53.100
A few hours of exposure
shouldn't pose a risk.

05:54.059 --> 05:55.978
Trip, take the bridge.

05:56.186 --> 05:57.646
Travis.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.102
A housing unit.

06:37.727 --> 06:39.896
No sign of weapons fire.

06:40.605 --> 06:42.149
Only rust.

06:42.649 --> 06:45.777
Whatever happened, I've gotta believe
they tried to let Earth know about it.

06:45.986 --> 06:48.280
We've got the schematics
for the communications tower.

06:48.488 --> 06:51.199
Good. See if
the data buffer's intact.

06:51.408 --> 06:53.743
We might be able to access
their last transmission logs.

06:53.952 --> 06:55.370
Aye, sir.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.290
Walk the perimeter.
See what else you can find.

06:58.873 --> 07:00.292
Judging by the isotope decay,

07:00.500 --> 07:04.004
the radiation levels 70 years ago
would have been lethal.

07:04.212 --> 07:05.964
If that killed them,
where are the bodies?

07:06.339 --> 07:08.508
Maybe they left the planet
before it could affect them.

07:08.717 --> 07:11.177
That would have been difficult.

07:11.886 --> 07:13.721
That's a bulkhead.

07:14.139 --> 07:16.433
They designed their ship
to be disassembled.

07:16.641 --> 07:18.685
That's how they built the colony.

07:20.687 --> 07:22.730
It was a one-way trip.

07:35.243 --> 07:36.744
Hello?

07:38.830 --> 07:41.874
We're not alone, sir.
There's someone in the forest.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.334
We're on our way.

08:19.704 --> 08:21.831
- I believe he went in there.
- You get a look at him?

08:22.039 --> 08:26.752
Yeah, he appeared to be a couple of
metres tall, biped, odd-looking scales.

08:26.961 --> 08:28.295
This leads to a network of caverns

08:28.504 --> 08:31.215
that extend
for several hundred metres.

08:31.424 --> 08:33.134
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead, sir.

08:33.342 --> 08:35.845
Get back to the shuttle,
and grab a pair of flashlights.

08:36.053 --> 08:38.389
- Make it quick.
- Yes, sir.

09:09.086 --> 09:11.713
It'd be best if I went first, sir.

09:46.998 --> 09:48.667
After you.

10:53.481 --> 10:54.941
Captain.

10:59.487 --> 11:01.489
My name is Archer.

11:02.907 --> 11:04.325
We're looking for some people.

11:06.202 --> 11:08.996
I was hoping you could help us.

11:11.457 --> 11:13.876
We're not going to hurt you.

11:16.462 --> 11:19.548
We're just trying to find out
what happened to them.

11:34.814 --> 11:36.315
Which way?

11:40.027 --> 11:41.487
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

11:42.488 --> 11:44.365
Captain?

11:44.573 --> 11:45.991
We're under attack.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.619
And I think
we just took a wrong turn.

11:50.204 --> 11:52.414
We could use a little help
navigating down here.

11:52.623 --> 11:53.999
Just a moment.

11:56.001 --> 12:00.673
In approximately three metres, a tunnel
will branch off to your left. Take it.

12:01.548 --> 12:02.633
I don't see a tunnel.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.802
Correction. Ten metres.

12:19.775 --> 12:21.401
I'm all right, sir.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.202
Malcolm?

12:34.831 --> 12:36.500
Malcolm?

12:51.556 --> 12:53.141
Where's Malcolm?

12:53.433 --> 12:55.060
Go.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.359
Take us up.

13:03.568 --> 13:06.238
If those aliens killed the colonists,
they could kill Malcolm too.

13:06.446 --> 13:07.697
Those weren't aliens.

13:07.906 --> 13:09.532
They're human.

13:19.876 --> 13:23.171
I don't get it. If they're human,
why were they shooting at us?

13:27.133 --> 13:29.093
Archer to the bridge.
What have you found?

13:29.302 --> 13:31.346
We've got a pretty good picture
of those caverns.

13:31.554 --> 13:33.640
And we've picked up
52 bio-signs so far.

13:33.848 --> 13:35.642
- All human.
- The only one I'm interested in

13:35.850 --> 13:38.186
right now is Lt Reed.
We've got to get him out of there.

13:38.394 --> 13:39.771
- Have you found him?
- Yes, sir.

13:39.979 --> 13:42.899
He's about 90 metres
below the surface.

13:43.107 --> 13:45.485
He's not responding to hails,
captain, but he's alive.

13:48.321 --> 13:50.365
Have Dr Phlox join us
in the Situation Room.

13:50.573 --> 13:51.574
Aye, sir.

13:52.325 --> 13:55.495
If these are the descendants
of the original colonists,

13:55.703 --> 13:58.247
they've never seen
other humans before.

13:58.623 --> 14:02.126
Maybe we looked as strange to them
as they did to us.

14:03.544 --> 14:06.047
12.6 kilometres worth of tunnels.

14:06.255 --> 14:08.299
Looks like they even dug a few wells.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.593
The geology's a little shaky.

14:10.802 --> 14:13.471
Some of these passageways
have collapsed.

14:13.679 --> 14:16.557
They may have been driven
underground by the radiation.

14:16.766 --> 14:19.352
- Have you figured out what caused it?
- Not yet.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.520
- What do they do for food?
- Many species feed

14:21.729 --> 14:24.732
on underground fauna and flora.
Tubers, fungi, insects.

14:24.941 --> 14:27.860
They also hunt
some kind of burrowing animal.

14:28.069 --> 14:29.070
Where's Malcolm?

14:29.528 --> 14:31.530
Right here, sir.
There are two people with him.

14:31.739 --> 14:34.325
- Can we use the transporter?
- He's too deep.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.287
A section of this tunnel is collapsed.

14:38.496 --> 14:41.332
It's empty. If we could get into it,
we could clear the obstruction

14:41.540 --> 14:44.794
with phase pistols. We'd be less than
20 metres from Lieutenant Reed.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.630
What about these two?
We have to assume they're armed.

14:47.838 --> 14:49.173
A stun grenade would solve that.

14:49.381 --> 14:51.926
I don't want to risk
any more casualties.

14:52.134 --> 14:53.886
Despite how they look,
they're still human.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.222
We've got to find some way
to talk to them.

14:56.430 --> 14:57.681
They didn't seem eager to talk.

14:57.890 --> 15:01.018
If I can't make first contact
with other hu...

15:03.228 --> 15:05.481
I don't have any business
being out here.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.109
Malcolm was shot.

15:09.485 --> 15:11.653
Grab your medical kit
and meet me at the launch bay.

15:11.862 --> 15:13.489
- Right away, sir.
- Captain.

15:13.697 --> 15:15.866
Try to find out
what irradiated the surface.

15:16.075 --> 15:18.660
You and Hoshi get to work
on that data buffer.

15:18.869 --> 15:22.331
I want to know if they tried
to send any messages to Earth.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.169
Do you think they know
we've returned?

15:27.377 --> 15:30.714
Hard not to hear a shuttlepod
landing on your roof.

15:36.053 --> 15:37.804
I'm unarmed.

15:39.222 --> 15:41.224
I just want to talk.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.689
I'm concerned about my officer.

15:48.899 --> 15:51.068
I'd like to see him.

16:16.718 --> 16:19.346
- Fancy meeting you here.
- How's the leg?

16:19.554 --> 16:22.557
I've lost a bit of blood, sir,
but I don't think it's too serious.

16:22.766 --> 16:25.310
May I have
my medical supplies, please?

16:32.984 --> 16:35.195
- Human?
- That's right.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.531
- What's that?
- My name is Phlox.

16:38.740 --> 16:41.826
I am a Denobulan.
I'm Captain Archer's physician.

16:42.911 --> 16:44.495
You tracked from Earth...

16:44.704 --> 16:45.914
...on a sky ship.

16:46.414 --> 16:48.333
It's called Enterprise.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.753
To what? Gut the rest of us?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.630
No.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.716
We're here to find out
what happened to the colony.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.259
We came to help you.

16:58.468 --> 17:00.595
Novans have had
enough help from you.

17:00.803 --> 17:03.264
We're not so easy to hunt as diggers.

17:03.473 --> 17:07.101
Go back to the overside
or we'll seal your passage.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.270
I told you,
we're not here to hurt anybody.

17:09.479 --> 17:11.439
Take that one, and don't track back.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.691
All right.

17:15.067 --> 17:18.154
But he won't be able to get through
these tunnels on one leg.

17:18.362 --> 17:21.490
My doctor needs to treat him.

17:41.052 --> 17:43.262
What makes you think
we're here to hurt you?

17:43.554 --> 17:45.556
Humans hurt Novans.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.100
Why do you think that?

17:48.309 --> 17:49.769
They gutted us.

17:50.394 --> 17:53.689
Our families. Our before-families.

17:55.482 --> 17:56.859
I don't understand.

17:57.234 --> 17:59.278
Poison rain.

17:59.737 --> 18:04.241
I was no taller than a digger,
but I can still see back.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.594
We lived on the overside,
then the humans dropped the poison,

18:07.653 --> 18:10.497
burned our skin,
gutted the grown ones.

18:10.706 --> 18:13.375
There was no place to go but here...

18:18.297 --> 18:21.467
To the underside.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.683
I think I know
what you're talking about.

18:29.892 --> 18:33.812
The poison rain.
It was some kind of radiation.

18:34.021 --> 18:36.899
I don't know what caused it,
but I'm sure it wasn't humans.

18:39.109 --> 18:42.154
He can walk, more or less.

18:42.362 --> 18:45.866
But I'll need to get him back to Sickbay
to remove the projectile.

18:48.368 --> 18:51.413
I know this'll be hard
for you to accept...

18:52.456 --> 18:54.791
...but you're the descendants
of human beings.

18:55.375 --> 18:59.212
Your ancestors colonised this planet
over 70 years ago.

18:59.421 --> 19:01.089
They came from Earth, just like I did.

19:01.673 --> 19:05.093
I don't know what happened,
but maybe

19:05.302 --> 19:07.471
we could work together and find out.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.431
He speaks in shale.

19:09.639 --> 19:12.184
If that's your way of calling me a liar...

19:12.559 --> 19:15.020
...give me a chance to prove
what I'm saying.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.564
My...

19:17.772 --> 19:19.399
...sky ship...

19:19.608 --> 19:22.527
...has tools that can help us
find out what happened here.

19:22.819 --> 19:27.240
- No.
- Are you aware that your mother...

19:27.866 --> 19:29.409
...is sick?

19:30.410 --> 19:33.580
This is one of the tools
the captain spoke of.

19:33.788 --> 19:36.583
It can tell me all kinds of things
about the inside of your body.

19:36.791 --> 19:40.378
She has an illness
that we call lung cancer,

19:40.587 --> 19:43.381
but it's easily cured.

19:44.841 --> 19:46.885
Dr Phlox can make her well.

19:47.093 --> 19:49.095
But she'd have to come back
to our ship.

19:49.304 --> 19:50.513
This is shale.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.474
They want to trap us
on the overside to gut us.

19:54.434 --> 19:55.893
How long of a day would it take?

19:56.436 --> 19:59.564
- Not long. A few hours at the most.
- Hours?

20:00.398 --> 20:03.901
She'd be back before the sun rises
on the overside.

20:08.531 --> 20:09.949
Let us help you.

20:13.077 --> 20:14.996
We track together.

20:16.747 --> 20:19.083
- This one stays.
- He needs to be treated as well.

20:19.292 --> 20:22.128
He'll be fine for a few hours.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.505
Don't worry about me, sir.

20:24.714 --> 20:27.133
I was just getting used to the place.

20:32.013 --> 20:36.142
Probably best if you lead the way.

20:57.455 --> 20:58.747
That's Enterprise.

20:59.248 --> 21:02.501
It's a lot like the ship that brought
the colonists to this planet.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.837
It was called the Conestoga.

21:08.299 --> 21:10.134
Maybe you were born onboard.

21:10.593 --> 21:13.846
Or were you born
after your parents got here?

21:14.346 --> 21:16.015
My parents were Novans.

21:16.223 --> 21:18.600
They came from the overside.

21:25.107 --> 21:27.067
- No more. Let me out.
- Open the passage.

21:27.276 --> 21:28.736
Just a few more seconds.

21:28.944 --> 21:31.697
- Open it.
- It's all right.

21:39.913 --> 21:41.832
My apologies for any discomfort.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.208
Is she healed?

21:43.417 --> 21:47.838
Not quite. First we have to determine
how far her sickness has spread.

21:49.548 --> 21:54.094
That is you. The inside of you, anyway.

21:55.846 --> 21:58.932
This picture will tell me
what kind of treatment she'll require.

22:00.058 --> 22:02.352
Interstitial tumours.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.690
The malignancy has spread
to her lymphatic system.

22:06.898 --> 22:09.818
She'll need a series
of cytolytic injections.

22:10.026 --> 22:11.862
- Injections?
- Medicine.

22:12.070 --> 22:14.573
He's just going to give her
some medicine.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.409
I'll need a few minutes to synthesise it.

22:19.911 --> 22:23.123
I've got some other pictures
you might like to see.

22:23.582 --> 22:26.918
One of my crewmen found these
in our database.

22:27.711 --> 22:31.506
They might help you remember
what it was like living on the overside

22:31.715 --> 22:33.383
before the poison rain.

22:33.591 --> 22:35.010
It's human shale.

22:35.218 --> 22:38.555
They're confusing our path.
You'll lose your tracks in this.

22:39.764 --> 22:42.225
I'm just trying to help you see
how you got here.

22:42.559 --> 22:44.561
All I see is digger filth.

22:44.769 --> 22:46.354
Well, look again.

22:46.855 --> 22:50.441
Because whether you want
to believe it or not, we're both human.

22:52.277 --> 22:55.405
Bury your drawings.

23:01.953 --> 23:03.413
Doctor...

23:04.706 --> 23:06.499
...keep me posted.

23:11.587 --> 23:13.464
Captain's starlog, supplemental.

23:13.673 --> 23:15.633
Sub-commander T'Pol
has discovered the remnants

23:15.842 --> 23:19.011
of an impact crater
that could explain the radiation.

23:19.887 --> 23:21.222
How far away is it?

23:21.431 --> 23:23.182
About 500 kilometres north.

23:23.391 --> 23:26.144
- How deep?
- It's been partially filled in by erosion

23:26.352 --> 23:28.271
over the years,
but I'm reading impact fractures

23:28.479 --> 23:30.314
down to nearly 2,000 metres.

23:30.523 --> 23:32.483
- Comet or an asteroid?
- An asteroid.

23:32.692 --> 23:33.985
A large one.

23:34.193 --> 23:38.322
The tectonic analysis puts the impact
at approximately 70 years ago.

23:39.365 --> 23:40.616
The poison rain.

23:40.825 --> 23:44.036
The geology was comprised
primarily of beresium ore.

23:44.245 --> 23:46.539
The thermo-shock would have created
a radioactive cloud

23:46.747 --> 23:49.750
that probably covered the northern
hemisphere for more than a year.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.628
They spent all those years
getting here...

23:55.214 --> 23:57.133
...and for what?

24:07.351 --> 24:09.562
That's an old MK-33, isn't it?

24:10.229 --> 24:11.939
Or is it a 34?

24:15.067 --> 24:17.027
Lmpressive body armour
you're wearing.

24:17.236 --> 24:18.946
Did you make it yourself?

24:20.906 --> 24:22.449
Right.

24:24.952 --> 24:27.913
I don't suppose there's a lavatory
on the premises, is there?

24:28.122 --> 24:30.290
I wouldn't mind freshening up a little.

24:32.167 --> 24:33.710
No.

24:33.919 --> 24:35.337
Didn't think so.

24:54.147 --> 24:56.233
Is your belly hollow?

24:56.566 --> 24:58.068
That all depends.

24:58.443 --> 24:59.611
What's for dinner?

25:11.164 --> 25:13.333
Digger meat.

25:15.752 --> 25:17.587
Looks a little...

25:17.796 --> 25:19.047
...undercooked.

25:19.297 --> 25:21.758
Humans are like damp moss.

25:21.967 --> 25:24.135
They rot on the underside.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.399
Not bad.

26:25.530 --> 26:26.906
Come in.

26:27.782 --> 26:29.575
It's a transmission, sir.

26:30.618 --> 26:33.538
It's the last one anyone made,
as far as we can tell.

26:33.746 --> 26:35.122
It was still in the buffer.

26:35.331 --> 26:36.958
It's Captain Mitchell.

26:38.417 --> 26:41.128
No matter how angry Logan's threats
may have seemed,

26:41.337 --> 26:43.297
there had to have been
a way of dealing with this

26:43.506 --> 26:45.258
other than attacking us.

26:45.675 --> 26:49.053
Nearly half the adults are dead,
including Dr Tracey,

26:49.261 --> 26:52.682
and everyone else is getting sick,
except for the younger children.

26:53.182 --> 26:55.059
If they have any chance of surviving,

26:55.267 --> 26:58.479
the least you could do is have
the Vulcans send a ship for them.

26:58.938 --> 27:01.774
But for all I know, they were the ones
you talked into attacking us.

27:01.982 --> 27:04.318
You wanted Terra Nova enough
to do this?

27:04.527 --> 27:07.363
Well, it's yours now,
but I doubt you'll be very pleased

27:07.571 --> 27:09.907
with what you find when you get here.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.327
Mark Logan was the head
of the opposition,

27:13.536 --> 27:15.955
the ones who were against
a second wave of settlers.

27:16.163 --> 27:19.667
Supposedly, he threatened to fire
at any ship that came into orbit.

27:20.209 --> 27:23.212
The irony is that Captain Mitchell's
message never reached Earth.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.756
The debris in the atmosphere
was too dense.

27:26.298 --> 27:30.719
So for some reason,
the young kids survive...

27:31.261 --> 27:33.722
...and begin living underground.

27:35.182 --> 27:38.060
Their last memories of their parents
are hearing them blame humans

27:38.268 --> 27:40.229
for destroying the colony.

27:41.647 --> 27:45.317
The idea that humans are the enemy
has been embedded in them

27:45.526 --> 27:47.611
for more than two generations.

27:49.905 --> 27:51.240
This isn't gonna be easy.

27:51.448 --> 27:53.450
Sickbay to Archer.

27:55.285 --> 27:58.163
- Go ahead.
- Could you come see me, please?

28:10.133 --> 28:11.510
Is everything all right?

28:11.718 --> 28:14.471
Nadet's cancer has been eliminated.

28:14.679 --> 28:19.184
- Nice work.
- But I found something quite troubling.

28:19.392 --> 28:22.437
Both she and her son are showing
signs of microcellular decay

28:22.646 --> 28:24.022
in their endocrine systems.

28:24.231 --> 28:27.567
Their underground water supply
has probably become contaminated.

28:27.776 --> 28:30.237
I don't have any medication
to treat this,

28:30.445 --> 28:32.572
and it's only going to get worse.

28:35.533 --> 28:37.160
Would bringing them
to the surface help?

28:37.369 --> 28:39.996
T'Pol says the soil and foliage
is going to remain irradiated

28:40.205 --> 28:42.207
for at least another decade.

28:45.835 --> 28:48.963
- How's she doing?
- She's as disagreeable as she was

28:49.172 --> 28:51.174
before I treated her.

28:51.549 --> 28:53.468
Bring them to the Situation Room.

28:54.010 --> 28:56.346
We are not leaving.

28:56.554 --> 28:58.556
It's not safe for you anymore.

29:00.225 --> 29:05.688
When the asteroid hit,
the fallout contained certain poisons.

29:06.272 --> 29:11.319
Humans under the age of 4 or 5
can usually build an immunity to them.

29:11.527 --> 29:12.695
That's why they survived.

29:12.904 --> 29:16.616
For the last two or three generations,
that immunity kept you all alive.

29:16.824 --> 29:19.202
But now the poisons have gotten
into your water supply.

29:19.410 --> 29:22.080
As Captain Archer says,
it is no longer safe.

29:22.288 --> 29:24.165
You humans tried
to gut our go-befores

29:24.374 --> 29:26.417
when they lived on the overside.

29:26.876 --> 29:28.753
Now you're trying to gut us.

29:28.961 --> 29:30.963
Dr Phlox just saved your life.

29:31.172 --> 29:33.841
Perhaps you should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

29:34.050 --> 29:36.177
After all, he's not human.

29:36.385 --> 29:37.637
Neither am I.

29:38.054 --> 29:42.016
Giant rocks falling from the sky...
Shale, it's all shale!

29:42.225 --> 29:43.768
Take us back.

29:45.728 --> 29:50.858
I went through about two to 300
photographs before I found this.

29:53.444 --> 29:55.363
Look familiar, Nadet?

29:55.905 --> 29:59.617
It's the overside.
Before the poison rain.

29:59.909 --> 30:01.494
And what about the people?

30:03.996 --> 30:05.331
Humans.

30:06.207 --> 30:08.459
What were humans doing
in your colony

30:08.667 --> 30:10.377
before it was destroyed?

30:13.839 --> 30:16.217
I think I can help answer that.

30:21.847 --> 30:24.975
You're sure none of these people
look familiar?

30:25.726 --> 30:28.938
From the data we retrieved
on this photograph,

30:29.146 --> 30:34.068
we're pretty sure this woman's name
was Vera Fuller.

30:35.569 --> 30:36.862
Ring a bell?

30:37.446 --> 30:39.448
It's the medicine they put in you.

30:39.656 --> 30:41.492
They're confusing your path.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.535
We need to leave.

30:44.119 --> 30:45.913
Look closely.

30:49.666 --> 30:51.335
Vera Fuller.

30:53.545 --> 30:55.756
- What do you remember?
- Shale!

30:56.465 --> 30:57.716
They're trying to trap you.

30:57.925 --> 31:01.428
Vera had a daughter
named Bernadette.

31:01.637 --> 31:04.932
She'd be about 75 now
in Earth years.

31:05.974 --> 31:07.643
Nadet?

31:09.061 --> 31:10.854
Bernadette?

31:12.856 --> 31:14.566
You say this is me?

31:14.775 --> 31:17.486
They're trying to make us
leave the underside.

31:18.195 --> 31:21.698
If we're not back before day,
your crewman will be gutted.

31:21.907 --> 31:23.533
Take us back.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.835
Is her treatment finished?

31:34.044 --> 31:36.588
- I should take one more thoracic scan.
- Fine.

31:36.796 --> 31:38.924
As soon as you're done,
bring them to the Launch Bay.

31:39.132 --> 31:40.717
Sub-commander.

31:47.432 --> 31:49.434
There are 58 human beings
in those tunnels.

31:49.643 --> 31:52.145
They'll all die if we don't get them out.
What do they think?

31:52.354 --> 31:57.150
They think we're a bunch of hostile
aliens trying to take their colony over.

31:57.734 --> 31:59.944
- Stun grenades.
- What?

32:00.528 --> 32:03.198
Commander Tucker's continued
to enhance the sensor resolution

32:03.406 --> 32:04.699
of their tunnels.

32:04.908 --> 32:08.661
We could transport stun grenades
to specific locations, detonate them,

32:08.870 --> 32:11.164
and use both shuttlepods
to bring them back to the ship.

32:11.372 --> 32:13.499
And then what? Put them in chains?

32:13.958 --> 32:16.377
I'm sure Mr Reed
could devise appropriate restraints.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.922
What the hell do you think this is,
a slave ship?

32:19.714 --> 32:22.383
We can't relocate them by force.

32:22.592 --> 32:25.303
The alternative was made
quite clear by Dr Phlox.

32:25.553 --> 32:29.640
We have to convince them that
returning to Earth is the right thing.

32:29.849 --> 32:32.185
We can't take them by force.

32:32.393 --> 32:36.397
- Are you certain it is the right thing?
- What are you talking about?

32:36.647 --> 32:38.941
When you get them back to Earth,
what will you do?

32:39.150 --> 32:41.652
Send them to school?
Teach them to read and write?

32:41.944 --> 32:44.572
Wear human clothing?
Eat human food?

32:44.780 --> 32:48.367
Teach them to live on the surface,
enjoy the sunshine?

32:48.618 --> 32:51.495
You're damn straight.
They're human beings.

32:51.704 --> 32:53.497
It's their birthright.

32:55.833 --> 32:58.252
It might take a little while,
but they'll adapt.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.672
It's a hell of a lot better
than dying down in those tunnels.

33:01.881 --> 33:05.176
They've lived in those tunnels
for three generations.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.512
You can't just pluck them up
and bring them to a strange world

33:08.721 --> 33:10.806
and hope they'll learn to conform.

33:11.891 --> 33:16.312
You'd be destroying their identity,
destroying the Novan culture.

33:21.609 --> 33:23.903
- Archer to Tucker.
- Captain.

33:24.111 --> 33:27.448
Get up here on the double,
and bring your maps with you.

33:28.532 --> 33:30.075
The debris cloud
reached to about here,

33:30.284 --> 33:32.870
10 or 12 degrees north
of the equator.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.456
- Southern hemisphere?
- Unaffected by the asteroid.

33:35.664 --> 33:37.416
Captain Archer.

33:38.876 --> 33:40.252
- Go ahead, doc.
- The two Novans

33:40.461 --> 33:41.503
are in Shuttlepod One.

33:41.712 --> 33:43.630
Will you be escorting them
back to the surface?

33:43.839 --> 33:45.799
I'll be there in a couple of minutes.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.635
There's gotta be similar
underground topography

33:48.844 --> 33:51.013
on one of these southern continents.

33:51.221 --> 33:55.017
Caves, caverns... Find them.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.394
Put that on a PADD for me.

33:58.145 --> 34:00.314
And it wouldn't hurt if they
were crawling with those...

34:00.522 --> 34:02.482
What do they call them? Diggers.

34:12.492 --> 34:15.661
Your planet has three large islands
to the south.

34:15.871 --> 34:17.998
We call them continents.

34:18.206 --> 34:22.085
The climate is nearly identical
to your overside.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.170
We don't know
how similar the underside is,

34:24.379 --> 34:27.340
but my people
are working on that now.

34:27.549 --> 34:31.594
The important thing is
the poison rain never fell there.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.139
You'd be safe.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.016
Your children would be safe.

34:36.224 --> 34:40.395
You could even spend time
on the overside if you wanted to.

34:40.937 --> 34:43.356
If our tunnels are infected...

34:43.565 --> 34:45.233
...you wouldn't want them so badly.

34:45.650 --> 34:49.446
We don't. We only want to help you.
Make you healthy.

34:52.449 --> 34:56.578
Was that photograph of Vera Fuller
and her daughter shale?

34:58.038 --> 35:01.041
Do you really believe
that we created it to trick you?

35:02.459 --> 35:04.085
You're human.

35:04.586 --> 35:06.004
So am I.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.256
Humans help each other.

35:08.590 --> 35:11.301
When we track
back to the underside...

35:11.509 --> 35:13.928
...we'll return your crewman...

35:14.137 --> 35:16.848
...only if you promise to leave.

35:17.056 --> 35:19.434
I've got the landing site
locked in, captain.

35:20.894 --> 35:22.478
Would you at least...

35:22.687 --> 35:25.607
...talk to your people,
tell them what I proposed?

35:45.543 --> 35:46.794
Our thrusters are down.

35:48.337 --> 35:49.714
Fire them up again.

35:53.467 --> 35:56.220
Pod One to Enterprise.
We've got an emergency.

36:06.188 --> 36:07.398
Is anyone hurt?

36:09.942 --> 36:13.612
We're okay, but getting out of here
is gonna be tricky.

36:13.904 --> 36:16.407
Can you give us the coordinates...?

36:19.994 --> 36:21.537
Captain?

36:23.330 --> 36:25.458
I think we're done dropping.

36:28.377 --> 36:29.587
How far have we gone?

36:30.212 --> 36:31.338
You're down about 8 metres.

36:31.547 --> 36:33.716
Looks like a couple
of the abandoned tunnels gave way.

36:34.633 --> 36:36.051
Open it.

36:37.469 --> 36:39.346
- Open it.
- Hold on.

36:39.555 --> 36:42.349
Trip, if I open the port hatch,
what am I gonna find?

36:42.641 --> 36:44.059
Open it.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.895
You're on the floor of a stable tunnel.
You should be okay.

36:47.563 --> 36:50.441
You're gonna have to build a rig
to get this pod back on the surface.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.234
Aye, sir.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.502
We're in the downslope passage.

37:10.711 --> 37:13.714
We need to pass the cut-through
to get to your crewman.

37:13.922 --> 37:15.716
Give me your pistol.

37:16.091 --> 37:17.134
What are you talking about?

37:17.342 --> 37:20.679
If you want to see your human alive,
you'll give me your pistol.

37:31.773 --> 37:33.942
Stay here with the shuttle.
Keep your com open.

37:43.118 --> 37:44.369
Help!

37:44.578 --> 37:46.496
Hold on a second.

37:48.164 --> 37:49.332
Do you hear that?

37:49.541 --> 37:52.168
Help! Help me!

37:52.961 --> 37:54.879
It's Akary.

38:00.552 --> 38:02.429
Help!

38:02.929 --> 38:04.597
Help!

38:07.434 --> 38:09.144
Help!

38:10.603 --> 38:13.314
He must have fallen when
your sky ship quaked the tunnels.

38:13.523 --> 38:16.151
- Are you hurt?
- I'm leg-broke.

38:16.359 --> 38:19.112
The wood has me sealed down.

38:21.114 --> 38:23.324
Would you risk your bones
to save a Novan?

38:23.992 --> 38:28.162
I'll do what I can, but I doubt
I can make it down there.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.087
We'll track together...

38:36.546 --> 38:38.464
...but you'll need to trust me.

39:50.077 --> 39:52.746
The water's rising. We have to hurry.

40:18.313 --> 40:20.440
I need you to give me my phase pistol.

40:20.649 --> 40:22.526
- My gun.
- Why?

40:22.859 --> 40:25.821
- So you can go free your hostage?
- So I can free this man.

40:28.448 --> 40:30.325
It's your turn to trust me.

40:51.972 --> 40:53.640
Give me a hand.

40:55.642 --> 40:56.935
Ready.

41:30.843 --> 41:32.720
- Captain.
- How are you holding up?

41:32.929 --> 41:34.722
Not badly, all things considered.

41:34.931 --> 41:37.642
But I really wouldn't mind
getting this bullet out of my leg.

41:37.850 --> 41:39.435
Tell them.

41:40.687 --> 41:44.232
Tell them what Archer said
about the islands to the south.

41:48.236 --> 41:51.572
They promised to leave.
Let them go. We'll be fine here.

41:51.781 --> 41:55.326
We're not fine. None of us is fine.

41:55.535 --> 41:58.121
We're rotting, all of us.

41:58.412 --> 42:00.414
They've promised to leave.

42:00.623 --> 42:02.333
I've seen back.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.544
Vera Fuller was my mother.

42:05.002 --> 42:07.046
That girl in the picture was me.

42:07.255 --> 42:08.881
A human girl.

42:09.090 --> 42:11.717
Our go-befores shared the same path.

42:11.926 --> 42:13.678
We should listen.

42:21.394 --> 42:24.105
- Ever heard of Judge Crater?
- Crater?

42:24.313 --> 42:26.899
Disappeared in the early 20th century.

42:27.108 --> 42:29.860
- How about Amelia Earhart?
- No.

42:30.653 --> 42:34.782
1937. Never found a trace of her.

42:35.324 --> 42:37.326
A lot of people spent years, decades,

42:37.535 --> 42:40.120
trying to figure out
what happened to them.

42:40.621 --> 42:44.458
But neither of those mysteries
holds a candle to Terra Nova.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.545
- And we solved it.
- Did more than that.

42:47.753 --> 42:49.880
Those people were a year or two
away from extinction.

42:50.089 --> 42:53.217
We didn't just find them.
We saved their lives.

42:53.926 --> 42:57.888
All these years
wondering about that colony.

42:58.889 --> 43:01.975
I never thought I'd become
a part of their history.

43:03.310 --> 43:05.145
Tell you what, Travis.

43:05.354 --> 43:08.190
Why don't you put together
the report for Starfleet.

43:08.399 --> 43:11.360
If I'm not mistaken,
it'll be headline news back home.

43:11.735 --> 43:14.488
"The Terra Nova Puzzle,
Solved at Last,"

43:14.696 --> 43:17.574
as told by
Ensign Travis Mayweather.

43:18.367 --> 43:19.535
Thank you, sir.
