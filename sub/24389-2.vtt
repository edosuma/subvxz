00:10.135 --> 00:12.931
<i>I do feel like
I am living like a rock star.</i>

00:13.411 --> 00:16.475
<i>I've driven close to half a billion
dollars' worth of supercars,</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:18.475
<i>but my life wasn't always like this.</i>

00:19.893 --> 00:22.189
I've seen these guys
with their $100,000 cars,

00:22.272 --> 00:24.255
<i>and I'm like, "Oh, that's nice.</i>

00:24.515 --> 00:27.384
<i>But I can still get it done
with my junkyard parts."</i>

00:27.497 --> 00:29.087
<i>I was stuck in the streets.</i>

00:29.137 --> 00:31.203
<i>I was gangbanging every day
and selling drugs.</i>

00:31.838 --> 00:34.596
<i>And drag racing is the only thing
that made me feel alive.</i>

00:34.707 --> 00:36.221
Put a little snort of nitrous.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.669
<i>We're gonna hurt
that Lamborghini's feelings.</i>

00:38.853 --> 00:41.068
Hammer. Oh, fuck.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.418
<i>Beating a supercar
with my Pinto</i>

00:43.502 --> 00:46.052
<i>would be enjoyable and hilarious.</i>

00:46.275 --> 00:48.999
- The clutch, make sure it's not on fire.
- Come on, guys, let's go!

00:49.130 --> 00:50.610
<i>My reputation's on the line.</i>

00:50.724 --> 00:53.707
<i>If I lose to a sleeper car,
it's not gonna be a good day.</i>

00:53.881 --> 00:56.071
<i>As soon as the light turns,
it's game on.</i>

00:56.265 --> 00:57.563
<i>Nice guy goes away.</i>

01:14.857 --> 01:17.202
<i>I've driven race cars
on Formula One tracks.</i>

01:17.286 --> 01:19.969
<i>I've taken McLarens and Corvettes,</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:21.779
<i>and Bugattis around those.</i>

01:21.994 --> 01:24.626
<i>I've taken 1600 Horsepower GT-Rs</i>

01:24.710 --> 01:27.546
<i>doing highway,
pulls up to 180 miles per hour.</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:29.299
<i>I've driven Twin Turbo Lamborghinis</i>

01:29.389 --> 01:31.659
<i>that sound like a fighter jet
screaming by.</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:39.089
Getting to drive these supercars is the
coolest thing I could possibly ask for.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.351
- You ready, Pepper?
- One second.

01:42.828 --> 01:44.871
All right, three, two, one, go.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.923
<i>My name is Pepper Yandell,
I'm a car photographer.</i>

01:51.109 --> 01:54.474
I travel the world,
shoot private collections for people

01:54.574 --> 01:57.909
in all sorts of different places,
countries, cultures, and classes.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.710
- How'd that taste?
- Not too good.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.290
I lived in Owasso, Oklahoma,
small town, not a lot of cars.

02:03.370 --> 02:06.418
<i>So, I moved down to Dallas,
with, like, maybe $400,</i>

02:06.501 --> 02:08.169
<i>got a job shooting cars full-time.</i>

02:08.252 --> 02:09.876
<i>Eventually, went full freelance,</i>

02:10.030 --> 02:12.872
and started traveling the world,
shooting cars for people.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.317
My clients are the top ten
richest people in the world.

02:21.758 --> 02:24.117
<i>So, they have security
all around them.</i>

02:24.227 --> 02:26.217
<i>Any time we go to a restaurant, we pull up</i>

02:26.405 --> 02:29.428
in like four-armored
fully blacked out stretched SUVs,

02:29.708 --> 02:32.362
and then you got like people
checking the doors and the exits,

02:32.707 --> 02:35.662
<i>and you feel like you're walking
in with the President some of the times.</i>

02:36.007 --> 02:39.256
<i>And just, "What am I doing here?
I'm just here to shoot a car. It's nuts."</i>

02:39.356 --> 02:41.755
<i>And it's giving me,
definitely a unique key</i>

02:41.880 --> 02:43.930
<i>to like a very locked off world.</i>

02:44.211 --> 02:45.850
They're princes, they're sheiks.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.334
<i>I did the math the other day,</i>

02:47.417 --> 02:49.782
<i>I've driven close to
$400,000,000 worth of cars.</i>

02:50.065 --> 02:52.346
<i>It's what I'm passionate about
and I get so much enjoyment</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:53.882
<i>just by pushing that start button.</i>

02:53.965 --> 02:55.252
One, two, three, four, five...

02:55.327 --> 02:58.407
<i>My buddy runs a company, he buys cars,
and ships them over to the Middle East,</i>

02:58.540 --> 02:59.936
but he also rents them out here.

03:00.172 --> 03:03.086
And so, anytime I come here,
he hooks me up, gives me a car.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.485
On this trip, he's hooked me up
with a yellow Lamborghini Huracán.

03:14.641 --> 03:16.981
<i>Every supercar has
its own unique feeling.</i>

03:17.106 --> 03:20.686
<i>This Lamborghini Huracán, they really
knocked it out the park with this design.</i>

03:21.026 --> 03:22.944
<i>It demands your attention.</i>

03:23.661 --> 03:26.202
<i>The sharp angles,
the super aggressive front end,</i>

03:26.286 --> 03:28.250
<i>like, it looks like
it's just angry at you.</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:30.916
<i>It just wants to eat the road
and kill every car around it.</i>

03:32.587 --> 03:36.341
10.4 seconds is what it's supposed to do
in a quarter mile, the Huracán.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.678
And I feel like at 10.4 seconds,
I have a pretty solid chance

03:39.761 --> 03:41.972
against most... any car.

03:42.697 --> 03:43.777
So I'm confident.

03:50.013 --> 03:53.462
A supercar is
a pretty boy's car,

03:53.537 --> 03:56.862
he paid for it,
he doesn't really drive it.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.746
It probably has 30 miles on it.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.138
Whatever, bro.
I don't really give a flying shit.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.472
Because you didn't build it yourself.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.669
When I was just 13, my dad,

04:12.961 --> 04:16.173
he had this Volkswagen Bus,
and he wanted to sell it

04:16.255 --> 04:18.668
because we needed to make
some money, we had to pay rent.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.817
So while he was away,
trying to scavenge for some parts,

04:22.137 --> 04:23.472
the motor was just sitting there.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.419
I watched him take it apart.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.049
So I said, "By the time he gets back,
I'm gonna have this motor back together."

04:29.494 --> 04:31.288
<i>When he got home,
he was amazed.</i>

04:31.605 --> 04:34.566
<i>"Who did this?"
I go, "I did. What do you think?"</i>

04:35.275 --> 04:38.491
He's like, "You know what,
let's put it in. Let's see if it runs."

04:38.695 --> 04:41.985
And that's why I always tell people,
with cars and with motors,

04:42.115 --> 04:45.118
I feel like
if you ever watched <i>Frankenstein,</i>

04:45.494 --> 04:49.372
when the monster was descending
from the electricity

04:49.456 --> 04:53.875
and he sat up,
and he's like, "It's alive,"

04:53.969 --> 04:56.188
that was the feeling that I had

04:56.546 --> 04:58.965
when I heard that engine fire up
for the first time,

04:59.049 --> 05:01.049
and it ran, and I did it.

05:05.856 --> 05:08.483
<i>The first time I came into the junkyard,
it was out of necessity.</i>

05:08.682 --> 05:12.657
<i>The car broke and there was some part
that I needed, and I couldn't afford it.</i>

05:12.857 --> 05:15.245
<i>So I figured, "You know what,
I'll just go to the junkyard,</i>

05:15.307 --> 05:17.633
see if I can get one,"
and that's how it started.

05:20.195 --> 05:24.032
<i>And it's a fun thing because it's like
it's a way to get an incredible deal.</i>

05:24.115 --> 05:27.869
<i>It's literally a tenth of the price of
what you're gonna buy at the parts store.</i>

05:29.955 --> 05:32.332
This is a perfect example
of what I'm talking about,

05:32.415 --> 05:33.853
when we can make some good money.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.623
Here you got a supercharger,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.798
you get a supercharger here
for 75 to 95 bucks.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.617
Turn around and flip this thing for $495.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.679
<i>It is the man shopping mall.</i>

05:45.762 --> 05:48.029
See these guys behind me right here,
you see those guys?

05:48.104 --> 05:49.804
They got their
little shopping cart, right?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.504
They're back here shopping,
you know, this is what we do.

05:59.574 --> 06:01.862
This is a 1971 Ford Pinto,

06:01.945 --> 06:03.700
it weighs 2100 pounds,

06:03.814 --> 06:06.550
it's got a Mustang SVO Motor that's built.

06:08.610 --> 06:11.492
This car puts out over 400 Horsepower

06:11.592 --> 06:13.753
and 420 pounds of torque.

06:14.925 --> 06:18.136
<i>I chose the Pinto
because I could get them dirt cheap.</i>

06:18.545 --> 06:21.792
I know they're light, you know,
sometimes, after I'd won a race,

06:21.867 --> 06:24.565
I've actually got out
and given my car a hug.

06:24.642 --> 06:26.928
I know that sounds ridiculous,
but after a while,

06:27.012 --> 06:30.223
your car becomes a part of you,
a part of your personality.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.560
An Indiana Grand Jury today
indicted the Ford Motor Company

06:33.642 --> 06:37.251
on criminal charges saying poor design,
contributed to a fiery crash

06:37.301 --> 06:39.407
that killed three occupants
of a Ford Pinto.

06:39.582 --> 06:43.236
What made the Pinto truly infamous
was the rear end,

06:43.320 --> 06:46.031
and that's where the fuel tank
is located.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.159
<i>It is very close to the rear bumper
and in a rear impact,</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:51.349
<i>it gets crushed against the rear axle,</i>

06:51.453 --> 06:54.122
<i>the tank gets punctured,
fuel gets ignited.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:58.627
The common stereotype of the Pinto

06:58.710 --> 07:00.378
is that the Pinto blows up.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.165
But what they never showed is the fact
that Ford fixed the problem

07:04.266 --> 07:06.009
with just this plastic sheet,

07:06.092 --> 07:08.100
so that the tank wasn't punctured

07:08.615 --> 07:10.389
by the bolts causing a spark.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.548
<i>But because of the bad name
built around the car,</i>

07:13.923 --> 07:17.053
<i>everybody thought, "Oh, this is
the most horrible car on the planet.</i>

07:17.162 --> 07:18.496
<i>Oh, it's gonna blow up."</i>

07:18.655 --> 07:20.782
<i>Okay, cool. I can get them for 100 bucks.</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:25.862
<i>My Pinto is a perfect sleeper
because they don't expect it to be fast.</i>

07:25.946 --> 07:28.414
<i>"It's slow, it sounds like a go cart,</i>

07:28.498 --> 07:31.648
<i>you know, you probably get
somewhere faster if you just ran."</i>

07:31.743 --> 07:34.720
So, for me,
it's like it is the ultimate sleeper.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.645
You pull up next to it,
and they don't know what's coming at them.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.019
You know, they're like, "Oh, it's just...

07:40.085 --> 07:42.646
This guy just put wheels and tires
on this darn thing.

07:42.871 --> 07:44.706
Just a silly little old man."

07:44.806 --> 07:47.674
I'm like, "Okay. Go ahead. Hit it."

07:51.204 --> 07:53.039
If I could beat a Lamborghini,

07:54.199 --> 07:57.321
I'm gonna be a legend,
that's what I'm looking for.

08:16.404 --> 08:18.124
<i>My name is Justin Crosby.</i>

08:18.208 --> 08:20.209
<i>I'm from Lancaster, California.</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.781
Here in the high desert Antelope Valley,

08:23.870 --> 08:27.042
<i>not much to do but build hotrods.</i>

08:27.594 --> 08:31.764
I was involved with racing
with my grandfather at a very young age

08:31.864 --> 08:35.432
and as I got older,
I got into the rodeo.

08:36.825 --> 08:38.881
And the crowd is making him watch him.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.438
Yup. Oh, boy…

08:42.063 --> 08:43.063
Hey, hey, hey!

08:43.148 --> 08:44.941
I decided to do rodeo

08:45.025 --> 08:47.328
rather than any other athletic sport,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.696
because I was born with nerve damage,

08:50.006 --> 08:52.741
and I couldn't compete like normal kids.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.906
<i>I couldn't run the bases in baseball,</i>

08:54.993 --> 08:57.720
<i>I couldn't run a hundred yards
in the football field.</i>

08:57.895 --> 09:01.546
<i>But I could ride a horse really well,
and that led to other things.</i>

09:01.848 --> 09:04.558
<i>Every young kid in or around rodeo,</i>

09:04.608 --> 09:07.947
<i>loves bull riding and it just,
it snatched me up.</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:11.278
I rode professionally
for about 12 years.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.763
<i>The feeling that you get
inside of your body,</i>

09:14.846 --> 09:18.559
the fear of possibly dying,
the fear of getting hurt,

09:18.725 --> 09:20.603
people doubting you, fuels you.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.757
<i>But with the sport rodeo,
it's not if you get hurt,</i>

09:25.890 --> 09:27.392
<i>it's win and how bad.</i>

09:28.151 --> 09:30.169
<i>I was in a practice arena</i>

09:30.245 --> 09:32.501
<i>when I lost hold with my feet,</i>

09:33.281 --> 09:37.813
and as the bull was rearing up,
his head and my face collided.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.279
<i>Just, it wiped my nose off
and fractured both eye sockets,</i>

09:42.415 --> 09:43.958
<i>jarred all my teeth loose.</i>

09:44.626 --> 09:46.377
When I got to the emergency room,

09:46.461 --> 09:49.636
I basically was holding my nose
in my hands.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.587
<i>I had to have total reconstructive
surgery of my nose.</i>

09:56.271 --> 10:00.309
<i>When a cowboy has to hang up
his spurs, it's a sad moment.</i>

10:00.592 --> 10:04.286
<i>All the years and the pain,
and the tears, and the blood,</i>

10:05.013 --> 10:06.389
<i>down the drain almost.</i>

10:06.627 --> 10:09.526
But I knew I would die

10:09.609 --> 10:12.100
if I continued to do it, it would kill me.

10:13.313 --> 10:17.557
So I dug deep in my roots, which is cars.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.691
<i>Racing, hotrods, tire smoke...</i>

10:26.192 --> 10:30.378
I kind of raised Justin for a while.
Him and his mom were separated.

10:30.627 --> 10:33.800
<i>When he was a little boy,
he followed me around everywhere I went,</i>

10:33.933 --> 10:35.134
<i>did everything together.</i>

10:35.485 --> 10:39.570
My grandfather has been a racer
since the '50s.

10:39.822 --> 10:43.281
This was my car in high school,
it's a '31 Chevy...

10:43.494 --> 10:45.348
Did you have Chevy in it or did you...

10:45.423 --> 10:46.913
I had a V8 Chevy. It had a...

10:46.971 --> 10:49.676
- A V8? Oh, so you had a V8?
- Yeah, I had a 283.

10:49.801 --> 10:52.962
You always hound on me, "V8's don't
make no torque, and blah, blah, blah".

10:53.037 --> 10:54.453
- And you had one?
- Yeah.

10:54.595 --> 10:57.824
He was always trying
to hop up low-powered vehicles.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.202
And... To race their buddy
from stop sign to stop sign.

11:01.536 --> 11:05.456
And growing up, and hearing
those stories, I wanted to be him.

11:05.540 --> 11:09.433
He was only about this tall and I started
taking him racing at lakes with me.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.212
<i>And he would polish the Crosley,</i>

11:11.296 --> 11:14.174
<i>our race car, because he wasn't
tall enough to do much else.</i>

11:14.257 --> 11:17.270
<i>Then that grew into learning
about the engine, valves,</i>

11:17.595 --> 11:21.652
<i>and he just had all kinds of knowledge
at, like, 13, 14 years old.</i>

11:23.908 --> 11:26.566
<i>I'm about American muscle.</i>

11:26.641 --> 11:27.778
<i>Nostalgic.</i>

11:27.845 --> 11:31.174
<i>We're riding in my 1946 Plymouth Coupe.</i>

11:31.599 --> 11:33.601
<i>Her name is Big Booty Judy.</i>

11:33.691 --> 11:36.223
<i>I picked it up out of a field,
believe it or not,</i>

11:36.423 --> 11:37.972
<i>for $50.</i>

11:39.532 --> 11:43.189
It was the first car produced
after World War II.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.247
<i>Therefore, they're kind of rare.
You don't see a lot of them.</i>

11:51.511 --> 11:55.299
<i>I started collecting parts
at drag races and swap meets.</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:58.765
Performance parts,
parts that I knew that worked.

11:59.669 --> 12:02.964
It took me about three
or four years to acquire all the parts.

12:03.548 --> 12:07.404
And I assembled this car in three days
in my grandfather's garage.

12:09.078 --> 12:11.061
<i>Big Booty Judy is a sleeper car.</i>

12:11.236 --> 12:14.984
<i>Looks like something grandpa would drive
to the Cruise Night on Friday night.</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:17.811
<i>It's old, it's heavy.
But don't underestimate her.</i>

12:19.747 --> 12:22.834
<i>It would be outstanding
to win this competition.</i>

12:23.235 --> 12:26.262
<i>It would feel amazing to know
that something that I built</i>

12:26.312 --> 12:28.707
<i>could beat a supercar.</i>

12:38.700 --> 12:40.755
<i>My name is Glasses Malone,</i>

12:40.885 --> 12:43.138
<i>and this is the best sleeper car
of all time.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.515
<i>It's an '87 Monte Carlo SS,</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:47.874
355 cubic inches.

12:48.063 --> 12:49.336
It's a monster.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.191
<i>I'm kind of, from like a Crip
neighborhood, so...</i>

12:55.275 --> 12:59.000
<i>This is the Blood neighborhood, this
108th, Denver Lanes, they're notorious.</i>

12:59.050 --> 13:00.613
People who don't get along over here.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.547
Couple of blocks away from me, Sam Cook
got murdered and shit.

13:03.668 --> 13:05.125
The legendary singer.

13:10.183 --> 13:13.251
As far as me and racing go,
my dad put me on racing

13:13.334 --> 13:15.273
when I was, like, three or four years old.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.681
<i>Like I've been going
to the street races with my father,</i>

13:17.819 --> 13:21.381
<i>the person who gave me
my first race car, my '68 Camaro.</i>

13:22.101 --> 13:25.015
<i>I've been going to the street races
with him longer than I can remember.</i>

13:34.214 --> 13:36.788
Potato salad, coleslaw.

13:37.063 --> 13:39.325
<i>This house right here
was like a sanctuary.</i>

13:39.598 --> 13:41.598
<i>It was special,
it was something to see growing up.</i>

13:41.705 --> 13:44.157
<i>It gonna be just race cars
all up and down the street.</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:47.750
<i>Novas, Camaros, Sevilles,
Vegas, Monte Carlos,</i>

13:47.856 --> 13:50.097
<i>just all kind of stuff, all in this yard.</i>

13:50.366 --> 13:52.982
<i>That's what our past time was
when I would see my dad.</i>

13:53.555 --> 13:55.775
Like I just want to come around
whatever he was doing.

13:56.152 --> 13:59.041
So, this is how we spent,
you know, weekends.

13:59.291 --> 14:02.950
The thing that do make this shit dangerous
is the fact they doing four in a line.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.853
Don't race the guy, drive your car.

14:06.129 --> 14:08.829
Glasses and I,
we had a lot of common interest.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.729
So we spent a lot of time,

14:10.989 --> 14:13.920
<i>and my other kids used to be like,</i>

14:14.395 --> 14:15.772
<i>"Glasses is your favorite."</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:18.107
<i>And no, I don't have a favorite.</i>

14:18.441 --> 14:20.860
But I go to him
quicker than I go to the rest

14:20.943 --> 14:22.660
because, like, I'mma get a good answer.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.616
Think they think because of a Lamborghini
cost 300 or 400,000 dollars

14:26.699 --> 14:30.770
that it could just beat, you know, a car
like this, that don't cost $20,000.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.603
That Lamborghini got to get wound up.

14:33.990 --> 14:37.368
Not to mention they sixty-four, like, two
seconds, like, two-two or something crazy.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.461
Yeah, that means,
they got to get wound up.

14:39.561 --> 14:40.690
<i>My mom and my dad</i>

14:40.790 --> 14:42.940
<i>pretty much did
whatever it took to make a living.</i>

14:43.216 --> 14:46.219
<i>They are really smart,
and my mom was a registered nurse,</i>

14:46.761 --> 14:48.429
<i>and my dad owned a tow truck,</i>

14:48.513 --> 14:51.682
<i>used to pretty much do whatever it take
to get a dollar.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:54.232
Mom went to prison a couple times.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.673
<i>It was the third time
being the last and worst.</i>

14:57.188 --> 14:59.127
<i>She got caught in Oklahoma</i>

14:59.195 --> 15:01.377
<i>with ten kilograms of cocaine,</i>

15:01.701 --> 15:05.384
<i>eight gallons of PCP, and, like, $50,000.</i>

15:06.697 --> 15:08.238
Besides that, it was really cool.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.261
Really never wanted for much,

15:10.701 --> 15:13.538
and they both were really good parents,
they co-parented really well.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.010
When they was together,
they would fight a lot, though, so.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.127
My dad shot my mom when I was younger,

15:19.794 --> 15:21.546
over some crazy shit,

15:22.204 --> 15:23.512
And that was like, good money.

15:23.598 --> 15:26.478
It was like, "Damn, his dad shot his mom?"
look behind their camera.

15:28.048 --> 15:30.688
- You remember that situation?
- Hell, yeah, I remember.

15:30.717 --> 15:33.193
- How old were you?
- Probably about five?

15:33.424 --> 15:34.759
It was a fight and shit.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.892
My mom didn't wanna stop fighting.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.897
My dad like, "I'mma shoot you
if you don't stop hitting me."

15:39.981 --> 15:42.979
She's like, "I don't give a fuck."
She hit him with a leg of a chair.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.869
And he shot her ass in the stomach.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.364
<i>She made him take her
to the hospital after that.</i>

15:48.437 --> 15:52.160
<i>And police tried to arrest her,
and she wouldn't let it happen.</i>

15:53.161 --> 15:55.997
My dad is a really good guy,
just no-nonsense.

15:56.364 --> 15:57.400
And my mom was just...

15:57.657 --> 16:00.499
whatever words couldn't accomplish,
her fist did the rest.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.212
That was pretty much the last of it.

16:03.321 --> 16:05.825
I think, you know,
they just was like, it was...

16:06.282 --> 16:09.327
Their shit was way too turbulent.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.387
<i>I was stuck in the streets,</i>

16:11.471 --> 16:13.598
<i>I was gangbanging every day
and selling drugs.</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:17.560
Then I started doing music, like, I was
already kind of fooling around with it.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.775
Next thing I know, I was wrapped
up into the music business.

16:24.058 --> 16:27.589
I couldn't legally drag race
because of my contract with Cash Money.

16:27.695 --> 16:31.699
Took me away from drag racing
for about a good ten years, maybe?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.811
I've never been more miserable
with my life.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.497
It's my first love. I don't even have
no children, you feelin' me?

16:37.580 --> 16:38.998
Drag racing is my children.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.877
<i>My car is my child, you know?</i>

16:41.377 --> 16:43.658
<i>When I'm around racing,
everything's right with the world.</i>

16:44.295 --> 16:46.047
<i>Everywhere else, everything is wrong.</i>

16:46.710 --> 16:49.634
Music business, you know, entertainment
business, everything is wrong.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.011
<i>It's just, all the mentality about
it is fucked up.</i>

16:52.094 --> 16:53.346
<i>You see the worst in people.</i>

16:53.429 --> 16:56.307
<i>Drag racing is one of the few times
I could be me.</i>

16:56.432 --> 16:59.018
<i>I need it, it's really like air,
it's like...</i>

16:59.352 --> 17:01.270
<i>it's the only thing
that make me feel alive.</i>

17:02.271 --> 17:05.398
I hear they said the supercar
is Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.540
Ain't nothing super about that shit.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.104
<i>That shit is a joke.
I had a couple of them.</i>

17:10.179 --> 17:12.858
They more like the cool thing to do,
you know what I'm saying?

17:12.933 --> 17:16.964
They just show you got money,
but they not fast. This shit fast.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.018
How's that?

17:26.753 --> 17:29.298
All right. What model
was that Lamborghini?

17:29.674 --> 17:30.675
Huracán?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.053
Quarter mile speeds,

17:34.178 --> 17:37.348
2017 Lamborghini Huracán.

17:41.425 --> 17:45.156
Ten forty-four is the best.
They're all-wheel drive.

17:45.323 --> 17:47.492
But they're not gonna launch
as hard as we can.

17:47.575 --> 17:48.522
No way.

17:48.523 --> 17:52.463
Well, I know it's electronically tuned
and everything,

17:52.697 --> 17:55.037
but I'm gonna tune mine
with a screwdriver.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.912
Well, I don't wanna sound conceited,

17:59.996 --> 18:02.873
but that's a walk in a park,
I could beat that car.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.709
Yeah. Yup, we got that covered.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.671
We'll check the timing,
I wanna pull about six degrees out of it.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.550
We'll check it and put
a little snort of nitrous,

18:12.748 --> 18:14.748
it's little insurance.

18:15.086 --> 18:18.464
We're gonna put just enough
to stay ahead of him, for sure.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.309
We're gonna hurt
that Lamborghini's feelings.

18:21.511 --> 18:23.994
- I'm excited about this.
- Let's get her done.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.816
<i>Nitrous oxide forces nitrous and fuel</i>

18:31.905 --> 18:34.505
<i>into the engine, which rapidly causes</i>

18:34.617 --> 18:36.449
<i>more horsepower and engine RPM.</i>

18:36.532 --> 18:38.701
<i>It's basically horsepower in a bottle.</i>

18:39.143 --> 18:42.750
<i>The downside of nitrous oxide is,
if your tuning is off,</i>

18:43.250 --> 18:47.000
<i>it could be catastrophic,
it could ruin the engine in a heartbeat.</i>

18:47.902 --> 18:50.104
Haven't had nitrous
in a car in a longtime,

18:50.304 --> 18:52.898
but let's awaken the beast.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.219
Like I said, I don't think we're gonna
need it, but it's good insurance.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.004
Well, it's better to have it
and not need it,

19:00.104 --> 19:02.304
- than to need it and not have it. So...
- Right.

19:02.354 --> 19:04.651
<i>Shortly after my face surgery,</i>

19:04.871 --> 19:07.271
I was getting sharp pains in my jaw,

19:07.355 --> 19:10.093
almost like a shocking sensation.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.019
<i>Come to find out from the head trauma,</i>

19:13.119 --> 19:15.758
I had knocked an artery

19:15.833 --> 19:17.948
and a nerve loose in my brain stem,

19:18.032 --> 19:20.956
and they were rubbing together,
and actually shorting out.

19:21.477 --> 19:25.231
<i>Life was dark, the pain was so bad.</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:29.043
<i>I can't even explain it, uh,
some thoughts of suicide.</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:33.589
<i>So, two brain surgeries later,
I am now pain-free.</i>

19:34.048 --> 19:36.092
My grandfather was a big part.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.804
He used to drive me down
to my follow up appointments.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.309
<i>And we would talk,
and we would go to the races...</i>

19:42.384 --> 19:46.534
And... I would say,
racing saved my life.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.147
It got me out of a cloud, so to speak.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.275
It got me out of a hole,
it got me out of my slump.

19:53.983 --> 19:56.863
- What do you think, grandpa?
- I think this is fun, man.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.699
- A Lambo-what?
- That Lambo-reckless.

19:59.782 --> 20:00.908
Ten-forties?

20:00.991 --> 20:04.328
I think I can make a John Deere tractor
beat a Lamborghini tractor.

20:05.755 --> 20:08.582
Ten-forties.
What's so super about that?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.754
Holy shit!

20:20.920 --> 20:23.957
It didn't miss a lick,
and he got in high gear right there.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.868
My grandpa would do cartwheels
if I won that race.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.440
He would be proud.

20:35.042 --> 20:36.627
<i>That would mean the world to me,</i>

20:37.153 --> 20:40.226
<i>for him and I to, to compete
on this level.</i>

20:41.774 --> 20:43.192
Yeah, that would be cool.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.176
<i>As a perfectionist, I like
to be in full control of every detail.</i>

20:51.526 --> 20:54.311
And with people, you got
bad hair days, and bad moods,

20:54.378 --> 20:56.355
<i>and just factors I can't control.</i>

20:56.911 --> 20:59.133
<i>But with a car, it looks the way it looks,</i>

20:59.216 --> 21:02.136
<i>it has its own, like, soul and spirit,
it makes you feel a certain way.</i>

21:02.227 --> 21:05.890
Like right now, I'm driving around
this Lamborghini in Downtown LA.

21:06.374 --> 21:09.164
And I feel like aggressive, and exciting.

21:11.992 --> 21:13.622
<i>I grew up in kind of a shell.</i>

21:13.847 --> 21:16.650
<i>My parents are amazing,
they took really good care of me.</i>

21:16.734 --> 21:19.069
<i>Couldn't ask for a better,
more loving family.</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:22.740
<i>But, you know, I've always
had this energy where I have to move,</i>

21:22.823 --> 21:24.450
<i>I have to be doing something different.</i>

21:24.742 --> 21:28.209
And unfortunately, when I moved
into the public-school system,

21:28.713 --> 21:32.466
you know, I kind of picked up
some bad habits, some bad behavior.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.678
<i>I was making dumb decisions,
I winded up getting kicked out of school.</i>

21:36.796 --> 21:39.381
<i>You know, found myself in trouble
with the law, multiple times.</i>

21:39.465 --> 21:43.260
<i>And I got really unmotivated
and disappointed with myself,</i>

21:43.344 --> 21:46.263
and didn't think I was gonna be able
to get out of that slump.

21:47.498 --> 21:51.659
And when I started shooting cars, that
allowed me to get out of that lifestyle,

21:51.959 --> 21:54.037
surround yourself with positive,
hopeful people,

21:54.663 --> 21:58.199
<i>and to use that energy
to shape your dreams into reality.</i>

21:58.724 --> 22:00.769
And actually being able to do
these amazing things,

22:00.844 --> 22:03.906
like drive around a Lamborghini
or travel through Europe and Monaco,

22:03.989 --> 22:06.731
<i>and the Middle East,
meet these amazing people,</i>

22:06.806 --> 22:09.328
<i>that's what keeps driving me
because my parents are now proud.</i>

22:09.411 --> 22:11.115
<i>They're not sad, they're not worried.</i>

22:11.413 --> 22:12.915
But I'm not stupid.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.077
I know when people see
a kid like me in a Lamborghini,

22:16.152 --> 22:18.460
they're gonna think,
"Oh, spoiled rich brat.

22:18.535 --> 22:20.560
His parents bought that.
He's probably a douchebag.

22:20.635 --> 22:22.992
He's probably gonna park sideways
in a normal spot."

22:23.467 --> 22:24.718
But you know what?

22:25.052 --> 22:28.347
<i>I'm just a normal guy like them that,
for some reason,</i>

22:28.430 --> 22:30.891
<i>has the means to drive this car
around a different city.</i>

22:41.819 --> 22:43.340
- I'm Cameron.
- I'm Chip.

22:43.390 --> 22:44.996
Nice to meet you.
So what brings you in?

22:45.140 --> 22:46.679
<i>I'm doing a little research.</i>

22:46.991 --> 22:50.128
<i>I'm racing a supercar over the weekend
and I got to be prepared.</i>

22:50.228 --> 22:52.765
<i>- What kinda race is it gonna be?
- It's a quarter mile.</i>

22:52.789 --> 22:54.164
<i>And it's against a Lambo.</i>

22:54.248 --> 22:56.250
What kind of Lambo
are you going up against?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.431
- A Huracán?
- Okay.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.280
You look at these magazines
and it's quoting a 10-6.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.833
The Huracán, it's essentially an automatic

23:03.908 --> 23:06.760
in a way where you don't have to worry
about clutch wear or anything.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.054
<i>The traction control system is so good,</i>

23:09.722 --> 23:12.332
<i>assuming he has it on,
he's not gonna spin out.</i>

23:12.933 --> 23:16.682
So if you're not a perfect jump
off the line then I think it'll be tough.

23:17.365 --> 23:19.248
- Okay.
- I could put my grandma in that car

23:19.298 --> 23:21.723
and she could probably run
under 11s easy.

23:22.284 --> 23:25.329
Hopefully, you get some guy where
he's new at it and he, he's nervous and...

23:26.027 --> 23:29.033
So he's gonna have to be nervous?
He's gonna have to be, "Oh, my God..."

23:29.116 --> 23:30.951
- And just miss the jump.
- And miss the jump.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.244
That's what we're all I'm hoping for
is that guy gets out of the car

23:34.363 --> 23:37.079
and he says, "Am I really driving it?"
And I'm gonna be like dude.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.034
- You know you got a really good chance.
- Yeah.

23:39.097 --> 23:40.761
- That'll be good for you.
- Yeah.

23:40.844 --> 23:41.885
Which is a plus.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.008
- All right dudes, here's the deal.
- Sure.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.048
All right, so it's a Lambo Huracán.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.095
It's a V-10, puts out 610.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.766
It's a 10-6 car, it weighs 4000 pounds

23:54.308 --> 23:56.393
and if it's four-wheel drive

23:56.602 --> 23:58.938
even his grandmother
could make that thing launch.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.900
Okay, so the transmission
that I'm planning on putting in

24:03.108 --> 24:06.570
is the T-bird transmission
and you checked the gear ratios, right?

24:06.642 --> 24:08.553
- Yeah.
- And what are we seeing there?

24:08.749 --> 24:09.949
Do we have enough first gear?

24:10.032 --> 24:11.784
- Yeah.
- So our gears are good?

24:11.867 --> 24:15.270
- Yeah. Weird vibration and the noise.
- It's just we have this weird vibration...

24:15.387 --> 24:18.499
Since this transmission
has a vibration, we're gonna go ahead

24:18.574 --> 24:20.432
and put the other trans in
that I know is good.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.190
Ready to rock? Let's get it done.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.620
Push it off to get it out.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.543
- Don't push it up.
- Don't push it too much.

24:27.618 --> 24:29.418
- It'll chop your fingers off.
- Yeah.

24:29.503 --> 24:30.903
Get that thing out of there.

24:33.839 --> 24:37.469
- It's caught on the nut. See that?
- So why is it hanging up?

24:37.593 --> 24:38.843
It's caught on a...

24:39.118 --> 24:40.987
It's caught on a nut.
There you go.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.699
Oh, fuck.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.431
Okay. It's out.

24:52.174 --> 24:54.960
What are you talking about?
That will fit. Hammer.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.911
Ah, fuck.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.307
- <i>Carly.
- Yeah?</i>

25:00.374 --> 25:01.821
I got McDonald's.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.334
You up?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.687
- Dude.
- Bathroom.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.050
<i>I have six kids.</i>

25:06.150 --> 25:09.633
<i>It's been a challenge, but I love
my family. I live for my family.</i>

25:09.808 --> 25:12.918
<i>There was a situation
where their mother, she got sick.</i>

25:13.162 --> 25:14.956
<i>She was saying that she was diabetic</i>

25:15.222 --> 25:17.911
<i>and that's why she was
looking ill and sickly.</i>

25:18.033 --> 25:21.537
One day I, I came home, and she had
put safety locks on the doors

25:21.770 --> 25:24.273
so if someone opens the door
they can't come in.

25:25.028 --> 25:28.337
Come to realize that the reason
that she put that on the door

25:28.612 --> 25:31.787
<i>wasn't so that people couldn't come in,
it's so the kids couldn't get out.</i>

25:33.799 --> 25:35.287
<i>She wasn't taking care of them.</i>

25:36.004 --> 25:38.662
<i>Then I found the pipe and it was meth.</i>

25:39.154 --> 25:42.370
<i>The money I was making
was going towards her habit.</i>

25:42.916 --> 25:45.560
It was nuts, like, when we were younger,

25:45.757 --> 25:48.520
we'd be sitting there waiting
for my mom to come home

25:48.957 --> 25:51.324
and my dad coming home
worried, like, "Where's your mom?"

25:51.884 --> 25:55.128
"We don't know, we haven't seen her
in the last two, three days."

25:55.679 --> 25:59.141
Or she would take us
to one of her drug dealers' house.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.607
Once, she actually left us there.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.431
<i>We lost everything.</i>

26:02.644 --> 26:05.663
<i>We went from this wonderful house
that I had out here</i>

26:06.065 --> 26:10.387
to having to swallow my pride

26:10.853 --> 26:12.479
and move in with my mother.

26:13.113 --> 26:16.061
I had divorced her, I said,
"You know what? This is permanent.

26:16.692 --> 26:18.444
This is it. We're done."

26:19.519 --> 26:21.751
And from that point on it's...

26:22.026 --> 26:23.789
...you know, I just
concentrate on my kids.

26:28.545 --> 26:32.366
<i>The junkyard to me is sanctuary
and it's salvation,</i>

26:33.009 --> 26:35.813
<i>because for me I looked at it
as this is a place</i>

26:35.888 --> 26:38.852
to get away from all the drama
and the bullshit

26:38.927 --> 26:41.827
that was going on at home
that I could not fix,

26:42.025 --> 26:44.977
but at the same time
I could fix things for my kids.

26:48.219 --> 26:51.015
<i>I've realized that there's money
all over the place here.</i>

26:51.090 --> 26:53.710
<i>There's opportunity everywhere
in the junkyard.</i>

26:53.993 --> 26:56.565
You know, if say, for instance,
my commission check is too low

26:56.715 --> 26:58.509
and I can't take care of the bills,

26:58.567 --> 27:02.362
I can look over here and see,
"Hey what's this tail light going for?"

27:04.790 --> 27:06.250
These headlights right here,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.727
after I cleaned and polished them,
blood, sweat, and tears,

27:09.611 --> 27:11.196
<i>took care of my daughter's dance class.</i>

27:11.921 --> 27:14.777
I think it's amazing
what he's done these past years

27:14.877 --> 27:18.107
to help us using the junkyard alone.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.982
It's a huge miracle.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.751
<i>I need to test out this new transmission.</i>

27:35.611 --> 27:36.891
His transmission's fine.

27:37.262 --> 27:39.887
I feel rattling,
I didn't hear any humming.

27:40.175 --> 27:42.202
- It went straight.
- It went straight.

27:42.268 --> 27:44.948
- We didn't get hit, so...
- Yeah. And I didn't go airborne.

27:45.078 --> 27:49.793
Beating a supercar with my Pinto would be
enjoyable and friggin' hilarious

27:50.451 --> 27:52.421
because when I meet him
at the end of that track

27:52.588 --> 27:55.424
and they realize that I spanked
the daylights out of them,

27:55.507 --> 28:00.137
he's gonna have to get out of that car
and look at my less than $3000 car

28:00.304 --> 28:02.921
and say, "Why did I spend
all this freaking money?"

28:11.268 --> 28:13.525
<i>A sleeper car is
someone taking an idea</i>

28:13.609 --> 28:16.543
<i>of what would be the best
possible version of their car,</i>

28:17.071 --> 28:20.282
spending tons of money and time
and effort to try to do it

28:20.365 --> 28:23.952
and hoping for the best, and usually
running into lots of problems.

28:25.204 --> 28:29.291
This is decades of racing,
research and development,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.001
Italian genius,

28:31.335 --> 28:34.546
<i>and with this car
there's a really good chance</i>

28:34.630 --> 28:37.132
<i>I'm gonna win this race,
but you know what,</i>

28:37.216 --> 28:39.527
I might be just a little bit nervous.

28:39.943 --> 28:42.446
To be honest, I've never done
launch control in this thing.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.473
I looked it up on YouTube.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.464
Apparently, I have to push this and this.

28:48.886 --> 28:49.886
Yup.

28:50.053 --> 28:52.139
And now it says,
"Thrust mode possible."

28:52.848 --> 28:56.082
I mean it should be pretty simple
so, you know,

28:56.210 --> 28:58.857
I think I should manage it
but we'll find out.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.415
<i>And I'm about to go get a haircut
because it's been a while.</i>

29:02.505 --> 29:04.039
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.620
- What'd you like to do with your hair?
- Just like a trim maybe.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.356
I like the front part. I feel, like,
maybe the back's a little too long.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.055
Wanna bring your head all the way back?
How long you in town?

29:12.255 --> 29:13.975
<i>I'm here to do a race this weekend.</i>

29:14.018 --> 29:18.215
We're gonna do a quarter mile race down
an airstrip with four cars side by side.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.717
Have you raced with the guys
that you're racing or...

29:21.009 --> 29:22.861
- I haven't meet the guys yet actually.
- Yeah?

29:23.133 --> 29:25.484
- Yeah. It's coconut? That's cool.
- Hmm-mm.

29:25.839 --> 29:30.135
It's, like, the resort spray, it gives
a nice texture, like you're at the beach.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.948
<i>When I'm not
recording music</i>

29:43.124 --> 29:45.492
<i>or doing a concert or mixing a song,</i>

29:45.575 --> 29:48.405
<i>I'm trying to hang out with Hot Dog
and soak up all the wisdom.</i>

29:49.913 --> 29:52.168
<i>I'm Craig Williams
but he's calling me Hot Dog.</i>

29:52.242 --> 29:54.993
<i>I met Glasses basically,
through the race community.</i>

29:55.677 --> 29:58.970
And we talked about racing.
I known his dad since I was kid,

29:59.619 --> 30:01.365
probably before Glasses was born.

30:01.754 --> 30:04.018
<i>This race for Glasses
is somewhat of a comeback.</i>

30:04.153 --> 30:06.157
He's been out
of the race game for a while.

30:06.207 --> 30:08.764
He's been trying to concentrate
on rapping and producing.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.643
We're going up against a Lamborghini
with the Monte Carlo.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.147
I think the advantage we will have
will be probably,

30:15.230 --> 30:18.799
the bottom-end
and midrange... take off.

30:19.618 --> 30:20.947
<i>We use a lot of nitrous</i>

30:21.472 --> 30:23.669
<i>because we need
that much nitrous for a Lamborghini.</i>

30:23.819 --> 30:25.354
You know, Lamborghinis are so fast.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.155
<i>Nitrous is a thing
that a lot of people are scared off.</i>

30:31.325 --> 30:33.080
<i>I think Hot Dog had one back fire.</i>

30:33.206 --> 30:35.550
It's almost like an explosion
but it's not.

30:35.650 --> 30:39.747
The boom ain't the same
but the fire and the explosion is just...

30:40.614 --> 30:41.614
sick.

30:43.499 --> 30:46.303
<i>I'm not doing modifications because
the car has already been modified.</i>

30:46.902 --> 30:49.501
<i>You didn't get a fast enough car
to make us feel threatened.</i>

30:49.673 --> 30:51.001
This is what I really do.

30:51.192 --> 30:54.519
<i>So there's no reason to make
modification, we're already prepared.</i>

30:55.187 --> 30:58.106
One of the things that I was thinking
about with a four-car wide race

30:58.523 --> 31:01.695
is, you know,
it probably can get a little dangerous.

31:01.837 --> 31:05.063
<i>Some of these cars get a little squirrelly
and they don't wanna get off the gas</i>

31:05.147 --> 31:06.905
<i>and they try to over correct or something.</i>

31:07.005 --> 31:09.910
<i>You have to know if you can
swerve to the right to avoid</i>

31:09.993 --> 31:11.995
<i>them hitting you or swerve to the left.</i>

31:12.412 --> 31:15.415
<i>So it's just gonna take some skills
to race four-wide.</i>

31:15.874 --> 31:18.126
<i>It's really dangerous.
It's just dangerous, period.</i>

31:18.852 --> 31:21.956
I'm not scared of the nitrous.
I'm not scared of anything about the car.

31:22.106 --> 31:24.860
At this point, it's just focusing
on making sure I don't fuck it up.

31:24.935 --> 31:26.575
I just don't got to fuck it up.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.553
As far as him winning or losing,

31:29.179 --> 31:31.040
I'm pretty sure he's gonna win also

31:31.276 --> 31:33.815
so that was never really a, a thought.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.019
So he can't lose, Glasses.

31:51.893 --> 31:54.770
<i>Race day, I like
to have her looking good,</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.415
<i>I like to be intimidating.</i>

31:57.040 --> 32:00.240
<i>If I've done everything right,
there's no way I can lose.</i>

32:00.390 --> 32:01.715
<i>We're gonna get this thing done.</i>

32:02.796 --> 32:04.548
<i>I'm expected to win this race.</i>

32:04.881 --> 32:08.385
<i>This is what we do.
The supercar is not a threat.</i>

32:19.162 --> 32:20.872
He's just making popcorn.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.066
Two-step right there, old school.

32:24.259 --> 32:27.155
We got this, right? We got this. Ready?
One, two, three, four!

32:27.355 --> 32:29.061
It's a four-cylinder panel.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.367
But it's the turbo.
They're like really fast.

32:32.626 --> 32:34.518
It sounds to me
like he hasn't got anything

32:34.668 --> 32:36.517
'til that turbo comes up
and then it goes.

32:36.603 --> 32:39.177
The reason why it's popping like that
is it's on the two-step

32:39.252 --> 32:41.602
- so it's shutting down the cylinder.
- Oh, I know that.

32:41.664 --> 32:43.280
And it's firing the fuel in just like...

32:43.405 --> 32:46.390
- Just like yours pops when you hear...
- On a two-step?

32:46.715 --> 32:50.651
But the dude with the Lambo, is he
chilling at some nice Sheraton, or Hilton?

32:50.944 --> 32:52.905
I'm excited to see
what color it'll be.

32:53.006 --> 32:54.030
Yeah.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.850
I bet you it's... No, I bet you
it's gonna be lime green?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.310
<i>No, it's gotta be yellow.</i>

32:59.978 --> 33:03.523
<i>I know what these people think,
"Oh, spoiled rich brat in a Lamborghini,</i>

33:03.899 --> 33:06.902
<i>probably doesn't care about the car
at all." But you know what?</i>

33:06.985 --> 33:09.237
<i>Stereotypes are not always true.</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:13.120
- We have a really, really good chance.
- Oh, here comes the one.

33:13.528 --> 33:14.688
Here it is.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.885
- Yellow, you called it.
- What'd I tell you? Oh!

33:19.228 --> 33:21.493
- You called it.
- Fresh meat on the grill.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.211
Fresh meat on the grill.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.964
The good news is,
back in my rodeo days,

33:28.423 --> 33:30.969
yellow is really, really bad luck.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.499
Yes, it is.

33:32.609 --> 33:34.846
You never wear yellow
in the rodeo ring, ever.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.860
- What's going on?
- What's up, man? I'm Pepper.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.600
- I'm Chip.
- Chip. Good to meet you.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.061
- Nice dude. Let's check it out.
- Thank you.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.656
Yeah, it's from the factory.

33:43.081 --> 33:45.482
So probably not as custom as yours.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.280
- You've been driving this bad boy around?
- I have been practicing.

33:48.519 --> 33:49.629
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:49.769 --> 33:51.823
Feel free to open the door
and check it out.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.919
- Yeah, let's take a look.
- Can we sit in it?

33:53.994 --> 33:56.409
Yeah, sit in it. Go ahead.
Do whatever you want.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.245
Yeah, why not? I'm Justin.

33:58.345 --> 33:59.785
- Justin. Pepper.
- Nice to meet you.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.081
- How are you doing?
- Good.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.459
So you've been working on the traction
control and all that kind of good stuff?

34:04.543 --> 34:08.040
Well, no, so I had, like,
100 Italians work on that for me.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.882
I had never done
the launch mode until today.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.594
- Okay.
- I practiced it. And it's pretty vicious.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.434
- Okay. Have you met Glasses yet? No?
- I haven't.

34:18.005 --> 34:19.005
Glasses.

34:19.543 --> 34:22.561
- What's up? How you doing? I'm Pepper.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.978
- You too.
- Beautiful car.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.752
- I appreciate that. Are you racing today?
- Yeah. Which car?

34:27.190 --> 34:28.315
Monte Carlo.

34:28.496 --> 34:31.817
- That's the one you got to worried about.
- That one I should worry about?

34:31.860 --> 34:34.277
It looks like it got one tire
on the back going all the way across.

34:34.302 --> 34:36.527
- That tire.
- Three wheels, that's it?

34:36.658 --> 34:38.126
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

34:38.364 --> 34:40.417
I was told this is the one
I should worry about?

34:40.491 --> 34:41.913
- Really?
- This looks like a beast.

34:42.088 --> 34:44.266
It is. It's a big beast.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.585
- Beautiful car.
- Yeah.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.170
- Yours is too. Yours is beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

34:49.328 --> 34:51.065
It's not even mine though,
that's the problem.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.489
Oh, you borrowed it?
Or Daddy's car?

34:53.641 --> 34:55.264
- No, definitely not Daddy's car.
- No?

34:56.386 --> 34:57.512
Girlfriend's?

34:58.263 --> 35:00.548
- Hey, that'd be a catch. No.
- Yeah, it would.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.969
- Bet she'd rather ride in this. Oh, yeah.
- You think?

35:03.135 --> 35:05.394
Oh, the trash-talking begins.

35:06.221 --> 35:08.630
I had to look up how to do
launch control in YouTube.

35:08.726 --> 35:09.771
Yeah.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.966
It worked out well this morning
so I'm hoping it works out the same today.

35:13.159 --> 35:15.181
So you learned how
to drive the car in YouTube?

35:15.469 --> 35:17.048
Well, no, I mean the launch control.

35:17.205 --> 35:18.805
Well, but that's driving the car, right?

35:18.886 --> 35:20.936
- It's part of driving the car, yeah.
- Fair enough.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.079
I'm just... I don't have...

35:23.413 --> 35:26.916
You can't YouTube a '46 Plymouth
and see how to get it to leave the line.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.138
I was just curious.

35:28.258 --> 35:30.065
You might get confused
trying to look that up.

35:30.136 --> 35:31.935
Yeah, I might. I'm an old hillbilly.

35:32.516 --> 35:34.071
Dude, he's too easy.

35:34.171 --> 35:36.676
"This car does everything
for me." Is that what he said?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.720
That's what cracked me up, when he
said he learned how to drive on YouTube.

35:39.977 --> 35:41.640
- Did he?
- It's freaking YouTube.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.074
He goes, "Well, I've been
practicing and watching YouTube."

35:44.293 --> 35:46.478
Call for drivers. Drivers only.

35:46.598 --> 35:48.938
The race begins
from a standing start

35:49.022 --> 35:52.587
and ends when the first vehicle
to complete the race in legal fashion

35:52.662 --> 35:54.444
crosses the official finish line.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.727
The race will start upon a signal
visible to all vehicles,

35:57.852 --> 36:00.817
so five red, five yellow, and then green.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.827
If a vehicle has a false start,

36:03.036 --> 36:05.505
all vehicles will be recalled
to the starting line.

36:05.800 --> 36:09.780
If a vehicle has a second false start,
that vehicle will be disqualified.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.809
If there's a false start,

36:12.523 --> 36:14.547
you guys notify us
at the end of the race?

36:15.350 --> 36:18.052
We'll notify you once we identified
that a false start has happened.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.638
Vehicles will be allowed
one tire warming run, or burnout,

36:21.763 --> 36:24.898
before the race to clean
and heat their tires if so desired.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.603
- Any questions on anything?
- No, sir.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.673
- We're good.
- All right. Thank you.

36:28.773 --> 36:30.648
Okay, fellows.
Good luck to you.

36:31.266 --> 36:33.209
<i>I've done everything
I possibly can to prepare.</i>

36:33.233 --> 36:35.151
<i>I left the car running
for about six hours.</i>

36:35.568 --> 36:37.445
<i>I am probably at a 16th of the tank.</i>

36:37.529 --> 36:39.813
<i>I'm just trying to get
as much weight out as possible.</i>

36:41.513 --> 36:43.736
<i>The one I'm worried about
is that teal-purple,</i>

36:43.886 --> 36:46.454
<i>A beautiful car,
but some serious stuff under that hood.</i>

36:47.622 --> 36:50.583
<i>Chip and his Pinto
is the one I'm worried about.</i>

36:50.667 --> 36:53.086
<i>That car is very light
and has a lot of horsepower.</i>

36:53.211 --> 36:54.879
<i>I know it's only a four-cylinder</i>

36:54.963 --> 36:58.049
<i>but it's electronically
injected turbocharged.</i>

36:58.642 --> 37:00.393
<i>That car is gonna give me problems.</i>

37:01.636 --> 37:04.548
<i>Every single one of these cars
has a lot of power.</i>

37:05.265 --> 37:08.226
<i>But if you can't make that thing
stick to the road,</i>

37:08.852 --> 37:10.520
<i>you're not gonna beat me.</i>

37:11.609 --> 37:14.209
<i>I wouldn't came this far
if I didn't think I could win.</i>

37:14.284 --> 37:17.164
<i>There's some good competition, this is
better competition than I thought.</i>

37:17.260 --> 37:19.095
<i>As long as I worry
about how I start</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:22.240
<i>and making sure those tires plant down
to stay down that track</i>

37:22.323 --> 37:25.364
<i>and it, you know, it don't blow the tires
away, I'm in a good shape.</i>

37:25.618 --> 37:28.172
- I'm sitting in this oven.
- Is that better?

37:28.396 --> 37:29.671
A lot better.

37:29.923 --> 37:31.506
- All right, man.
- All right, man. Good luck.

37:31.530 --> 37:33.165
- We got this.
- We got this.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.266
<i>So it all starts
with a burnout.</i>

37:35.362 --> 37:39.119
<i>The burnout is the most important thing,
you know, spinning the tires.</i>

37:51.478 --> 37:52.937
That's burnout for him.

37:53.755 --> 37:56.855
Spin it all. Look at the clutch,
make sure it's not on fire.

37:59.602 --> 38:01.312
The wheels didn't spin at all?

38:02.130 --> 38:04.232
Are you kidding me? Damn it.

38:11.806 --> 38:13.057
Yeah, that's a burnout.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.149
<i>Pepper in the Lamborghini, cute.</i>

38:18.087 --> 38:20.590
<i>He has eight hours
behind the steering wheel,</i>

38:20.800 --> 38:24.427
<i>I have three and a half years
in this car</i>

38:24.511 --> 38:26.054
<i>and years before that.</i>

38:26.429 --> 38:27.858
<i>He should have stayed home.</i>

38:28.350 --> 38:31.111
<i>My reputation's on the line.
If I lose to a sleeper car,</i>

38:31.186 --> 38:33.785
<i>I'm going to be put in a cone of shame.
I just can't do that.</i>

38:34.103 --> 38:35.473
<i>I have to win this race.</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:38.362
<i>And if I lose it, it's gonna hurt.</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:42.617
First place is gonna be me
and Big Booty Judy.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.482
<i>Second place is gonna be
between the Monte Carlo and the Pinto.</i>

38:46.533 --> 38:48.359
<i>Supercar is gonna be last.</i>

39:34.255 --> 39:36.105
Lambo, Plymouth...

39:37.584 --> 39:38.584
Pinto last.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.260
- Nice.
- All right.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.321
- That thing is quick.
- Yeah, it is quick.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.264
That Lambo kind of
left early, guys.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.475
- We, we thought it was clean.
- You might wanna look at that.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.979
You guys might wanna look at that film.
I think he left before the green light.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.596
They're gonna
look at the film.

39:59.683 --> 40:01.302
Yeah, in my book, that's a win.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.487
- I don't think so.
- No?

40:03.813 --> 40:06.279
- We might be able to check it. Yeah.
- We can check.

40:06.407 --> 40:08.092
You saw how he jumped off the line.

40:08.167 --> 40:10.500
It looked like he must
have taken off early but he didn't.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.694
<i>- He launched hard.
- Good.</i>

40:20.860 --> 40:22.879
<i>And you both got off
the line together.</i>

40:22.962 --> 40:24.964
<i>And you got into a little bit
of wheel spin.</i>

40:25.048 --> 40:26.925
- <i>Boy, that's surprising.
- Right.</i>

40:27.008 --> 40:29.626
<i>Dude, I was honestly
kind of worried about you, for real.</i>

40:29.701 --> 40:32.263
<i>- But I mean, if it...
- I was the only one close to you.</i>

40:32.287 --> 40:35.784
I lost. I lost fair and square,
no excuses.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.936
<i>That Lamborghini showed me up.</i>

40:38.019 --> 40:40.146
<i>And I don't get showed up very often.</i>

40:40.229 --> 40:43.537
<i>And, I probably won't sleep
for the next three days.</i>

40:43.775 --> 40:45.526
<i>When I first let off
the brake pedal</i>

40:45.550 --> 40:47.320
<i>there's was a millisecond of hesitation.</i>

40:47.403 --> 40:50.868
I had this thought run through my mind,
"Man, this is it. I just lost."

40:51.157 --> 40:54.077
<i>And then I'm getting quarter way
down the track and I don't see anyone.</i>

40:54.160 --> 40:57.513
<i>I'm halfway down the track. And I'm still,
like, chugging along. I don't see anyone.</i>

40:57.705 --> 41:01.831
<i>I think it's great that I was
able to compete with a supercar.</i>

41:02.176 --> 41:03.631
<i>It was quite the experience.</i>

41:04.170 --> 41:05.343
I made a decision.

41:05.493 --> 41:08.893
I kind of knew it was gonna be a decision
that was gonna probably cost me the win.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.838
<i>I just had to turn the nitrous off.</i>

41:11.135 --> 41:13.054
<i>Being this my first race in ten years,</i>

41:13.137 --> 41:15.556
<i>have a big hit of nitrous come in,
it could be dangerous.</i>

41:15.650 --> 41:19.477
It just would have been a bad thing,
I might have been somewhere over here,

41:20.561 --> 41:23.435
in the grassy knolls, so you got
to take the wins with the losses.

41:23.973 --> 41:25.606
<i>I'm really impressed with the Plymouth.</i>

41:25.896 --> 41:27.944
<i>That guy drove the fuck out that car.</i>

41:28.027 --> 41:30.972
<i>You can see when the nitrous came on,
the black track...</i>

41:32.156 --> 41:34.283
<i>two, 300 feet, he never lifted.</i>

41:34.450 --> 41:36.202
Justin, his heart big.

41:37.053 --> 41:39.973
It was a really hot day.
Even the ground, I could barely touch it.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.334
And that heat, the clutch just said,
you know what? That's it.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.836
<i>We've had enough.</i>

41:44.961 --> 41:47.880
<i>But I wanna thank you guys for giving me
the opportunity to share</i>

41:48.423 --> 41:49.924
our lives, you know.

41:50.008 --> 41:54.095
And what we do in our lives,
and what the junkyard dogs, what we do.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.180
<i>We're not just a bunch of knuckleheads.</i>

41:56.264 --> 41:58.558
<i>We're, we're not a bunch
of welfare recipients.</i>

41:58.766 --> 42:01.519
We're guys that are out there,
working hard,

42:01.769 --> 42:05.803
supporting our families, and figuring out
a way to still have fun at the track.

42:06.327 --> 42:08.503
I had faith in myself,
I had faith in the car,

42:08.553 --> 42:10.678
and luckily, it all came together
and I got a victory.

42:11.571 --> 42:12.860
<i>I'm really happy.</i>

42:12.943 --> 42:15.431
<i>This Lamborghini Huracán
is a seriously amazing car.</i>

42:15.526 --> 42:18.206
<i>You feel like you're skydiving,
like, you just jumped out of a plane</i>

42:18.286 --> 42:20.632
<i>just by hitting the gas pedal,
it's nuts.</i>

42:21.004 --> 42:24.542
<i>And of course, this is amazing.
This is the coolest feeling ever to win.</i>
