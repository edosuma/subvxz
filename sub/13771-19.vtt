For the whole weekend!

00:57.492 --> 00:58.710
Can you believe this?

00:58.797 --> 01:00.321
Like I need motivation.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.062
And they just told you
about it today?

01:02.149 --> 01:05.413
They claim it was in some "memo"
they sent me three months ago.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.892
So now, suddenly

01:06.979 --> 01:09.547
my job includes weekend seminars
and memo-reading.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.506
Can they really force you to go?

01:11.593 --> 01:12.985
Lois, they can make
you do anything.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.422
Once you sign up for
a job in this country,

01:14.509 --> 01:15.858
you give away the whole
kit and kaboodle.

our kids...

01:18.426 --> 01:20.384

Okay, everybody, dinner.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.605
This is all just an exercise

01:23.692 --> 01:25.824

who's boss.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.217
They're just trying
to motivate me

01:27.304 --> 01:29.132
to keep me in my place--

01:29.219 --> 01:32.048

of ever digging my way out...

01:32.135 --> 01:35.225

01:36.879 --> 01:38.272
Sorry. I forgot
how late it was.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.534
Why are your fingernails clean?

01:39.621 --> 01:41.536
Did you clean
your fingernails?

01:41.623 --> 01:43.407
I thought I'd try it,
and it turns out I like it.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.061
It makes me feel
good about myself.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.281
Well, that's enough of that.
It's time for dinner.

is in the garbage again.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.810
Go away. Scat!

01:54.897 --> 01:57.291
You know why they like our
trash is Jamie's dirty diapers.

01:57.378 --> 02:00.076
If he digested
his food a little better,

02:00.163 --> 02:01.947
there wouldn't be so much
for them to eat in there.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.646
Filthy,
disgusting animals.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.517
You know, Mom, if you
double-bagged the trash,

02:06.604 --> 02:08.301
the dogs might not be
able to smell it.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.653
Uh-oh. Reese just made
the classic mistake

02:11.740 --> 02:15.004
of expressing an interest
in something that Mom said.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.310
All right, Reese,

02:16.397 --> 02:17.572
since you're so full
of good ideas,

02:17.659 --> 02:18.964
why don't you be in charge

02:19.051 --> 02:20.662
of cleaning up the garbage
from now on.

02:20.749 --> 02:23.404
If he just shuts up now,
it might not get any worse.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.014
I don't see why it matters

02:25.101 --> 02:26.320
if some dogs dump
a little garbage on our lawn.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.060
The backyard's a mess already.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.715
Oh, this is hard to watch.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.291
Hey, get lost.
Get out of here.

You come back to laugh at me?

02:44.076 --> 02:45.469
You think you're so smart?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.384
I am a human being.

02:47.471 --> 02:50.257
I am probably smarter than the
smartest dog that's ever lived.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.562
Now shoo. Shoo!

Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

03:16.370 --> 03:18.459
Reese, where have
you been all night?

03:18.546 --> 03:19.895
I started chasing these dogs,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.984
and it turned out
they were really cool.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.160
We went to the park, and then
we found a tennis ball.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.901
And I took it from Toffee,
and then Toffee took it from me

03:25.988 --> 03:27.163
and gave it to Rusty.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.599
And then we drank
some water.

03:28.686 --> 03:29.948
And then we turned over
some trash cans.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.646
Then Lucky did
this hilarious thing

03:31.733 --> 03:33.169
where he rubs his butt
on the ground.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.301
I can't do it.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.345
So then we chased this cat

03:35.432 --> 03:36.433
that was all like, "Aagh!"

03:36.520 --> 03:37.434
Stupid cat.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.653
Then we stopped at the 7-Eleven,

03:38.740 --> 03:40.263
and I went inside
and had a Coke

03:40.350 --> 03:41.960
while they had some burritos
out of the Dumpster.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.745
Spike ate his twice.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.791
Wait a minute. You spent
the night in a dog pack?

03:46.878 --> 03:48.619
Yeah. So then there
were these squirrels

03:48.706 --> 03:50.099
who were like, "We're up in
a tree, you'll never get us."

03:50.186 --> 03:51.970
You're talking about them
like they're friends.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.581
They're just animals.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.365
Well, I'm sorry that
we're not like your friends,

sitting around all intellectual,
discussing multiplication.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.937
You can't get into bed
like that. You stink.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.765
Hey, I got checked out pretty
thoroughly in that department,

04:03.852 --> 04:05.593
and I didn't hear
any complaints.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.991
Every one of you is here
because you're successful!

04:13.078 --> 04:16.298
Successful
at letting yourself down!

04:16.386 --> 04:19.346
Nobody's better
at settling,

04:20.434 --> 04:21.957

04:22.043 --> 04:23.785
and those who count on you.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.701
Congratulations.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.318
You all got here
the exact same way:

04:35.405 --> 04:36.885

04:36.972 --> 04:38.539
Postpone that dream.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.975
Reduce that goal.

Just another year,

04:42.194 --> 04:44.371

04:44.458 --> 04:45.894
Now you tell yourself

04:45.981 --> 04:47.548
it's good enough.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.593
It's not good enough!

but you can.

you're talking about.

-Who is she?
-Why does that matter?

Who is she?!

05:43.299 --> 05:44.735
Mrs. Finnegan.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.434
It doesn't mean anything.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.870
A couple of weeks ago,
I stopped by her house,

05:48.957 --> 05:50.350
and she had her iron out.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.353
She was just so nice,
and there was cake.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.963

05:55.050 --> 05:57.182
before you get any
cake around here.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.601
for the next eight weekends.

10:01.688 --> 10:02.863
-Wow.
-This is the beginning

10:02.950 --> 10:04.255
of something, Lois.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.606
The bosses are seeing me
in a whole new light.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.259
Did they cross you off
the probation list?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.087
In ink.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.523
-Morning, son.
-Hi, Dad.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.395
Thanks, Mom!

10:13.482 --> 10:15.876
I called Mrs. Finnegan.

10:15.963 --> 10:16.920
You what?

10:17.007 --> 10:17.965
She knows I know.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.880
You're never seeing her again.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.449
I can't believe you told her
we had an understanding.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.191
Morning.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.715
Reese, I need you to put
your dirty clothes

10:28.802 --> 10:30.499
in the hamper before
you leave this morning.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.762
-I already did it, Mom.
-You did? Why?

10:32.849 --> 10:35.025
I feel bad I haven't always
pulled my weight around here.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.245
I mean, you're the leader.
It's my place to respect you.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.508
Well... thank you, Reese.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.078
-Hey.
-Good morning, Malcolm.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.819
There's money on the counter
for your yearbook.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.298
I don't want
to buy a yearbook.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.604
I don't want anything
that will remind me

10:48.691 --> 10:49.866
I ever went to
that stupid school.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.041
How can you say that?

10:51.128 --> 10:51.999
Being part of a group

10:52.086 --> 10:53.174
is important.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.915
Don't you care about loyalty?

10:55.002 --> 10:56.612
I think loyalty is the most
important thing there is.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.353
Well, I'm glad
at least one of my sons

10:58.440 --> 10:59.615
knows something about that.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.403
Hey!
What are you doing here?!

11:05.490 --> 11:06.840
This isn't your house!

11:06.927 --> 11:09.190
You don't live here!
We live here!

11:09.277 --> 11:10.408
This is our house!

11:10.495 --> 11:12.193
What do you want?!
Huh?! What?!

11:12.280 --> 11:15.587
What?! What?!
What?! What?!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.329
What?! What?! What?!

11:21.724 --> 11:22.725
HAL:
You'll have to climb

11:22.812 --> 11:24.509
the ladder of achievement

11:24.596 --> 11:26.773
one rung at a time.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.037
You'll never reach the top
if you don't start climbing.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.387
And when you reach the top,

11:32.474 --> 11:36.608
you realize
that the journey never ends.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.698
Excuse me.

11:38.785 --> 11:39.916
If you're at the top,

11:40.003 --> 11:42.005
how come
the journey doesn't end?

11:42.092 --> 11:45.052
Because at the top
of the ladder,

11:45.139 --> 11:46.923
there's a car.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.969
[all murmur, giggle]

11:49.056 --> 11:50.448
The question is,

11:50.535 --> 11:51.493
will you be driving?

11:51.580 --> 11:53.103
Or just a passenger?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.715
Whenever you let
somebody else drive,

11:55.802 --> 11:57.151
he might have errands to do.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.979
Where do you think
he might stop?

12:02.373 --> 12:03.505
The dry cleaners?

12:03.592 --> 12:04.985
Very good.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.770
Where else?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.641
-Drugstore?
-Yes!

12:11.774 --> 12:13.254
Where else? Tim?

12:13.341 --> 12:14.559
There's a place you can go

12:14.646 --> 12:16.213
to have your shoes treated

12:16.300 --> 12:18.302
so they won't develop
a smell over time.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.782
Excellent!

12:20.827 --> 12:27.181
Okay, now, what does
all this... mean?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.798
[quietly]:
It means nothing.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.410
It means nothing!

12:39.497 --> 12:40.890
This is what happens

12:40.977 --> 12:43.371
when you let somebody
else drive the car.

12:43.458 --> 12:48.158
You've all got to be the drivers
of your own car.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.291
And what do you do
if the gas gauge says

12:50.378 --> 12:51.640
your tank is empty?

12:51.727 --> 12:53.033
Stop at a gas station?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.992
No! You keep driving!

12:56.079 --> 12:58.255
You don't let anything stop you.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.866
Let me hear some "Vroom."

12:59.953 --> 13:00.954
Vroom!

13:01.041 --> 13:02.738
You know!
[laughs]

13:03.652 --> 13:04.784
Excuse me, Hal.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.350
I need to have bathroom break.

13:06.437 --> 13:10.224
Need... or want?

13:10.311 --> 13:11.573
I'd say need, Hal.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.314
I really have to go
to the bathroom.

13:13.401 --> 13:14.358
[everyone agreeing]

13:14.445 --> 13:15.969
So this is something

13:16.056 --> 13:18.841
none of us feel
we can overcome?

13:18.928 --> 13:20.321
This has us beat.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.279
Well, then, we can
put our work here aside

13:22.366 --> 13:24.542
and all go to the bathroom.

13:24.629 --> 13:28.590
Only there's no bathroom
in the car!

13:31.201 --> 13:31.941
Hey, Mom.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.987
Here's your lunch.

13:34.074 --> 13:37.077
Mm. Meat loaf sandwich.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.171
Oh, morning, dear.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.000
Oh, honey,
it feels so good

13:47.087 --> 13:49.437
to be helping people take
control of their live.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.570
Milton in Accounting called me
from the Motel 6 this morning.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.181
He had to leave
his wife and kids,

13:54.268 --> 13:56.183
but as soon as the Ice Capades
reads his script,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.098
he's moving the
whole family to New York.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.577
What are you doing?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.101
Oh, I keep trying
and trying to get Jamie

14:01.188 --> 14:03.190
to use the potty,
but he keeps refusing.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.018
Those stupid
parenting books say

14:05.105 --> 14:06.541
to put stickers all over it,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.848
make it a happy place,
so I figured why not?

14:08.935 --> 14:11.328
I obviously don't know anything
about raising children.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.026
Damn it!

14:13.113 --> 14:14.679
What's wrong with these boys?

14:14.766 --> 14:17.421
Honey, let me handle this.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.947
You are a superstar!

14:21.034 --> 14:22.600
You're not afraid of this potty!

14:22.687 --> 14:25.168
This potty is
afraid of you!

14:25.255 --> 14:28.258
You have to visualize
your success!

14:28.345 --> 14:31.000
Now, let's look at the five
lies you tell yourself

14:31.087 --> 14:34.221
that prevent you from
being all that you can be!

14:38.921 --> 14:40.227
Oh, Hal!

14:46.189 --> 14:48.061
Reese, where have you been?
Why weren't you in school today?

14:48.148 --> 14:50.019
A pack from another neighborhood
was sniffing around,

14:50.106 --> 14:51.368
trying to move
into our territory.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.892
Me and the boys had
a score to settle.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.590
You were out
fighting with dogs?

14:55.677 --> 14:56.939
What is wrong with you?

14:57.026 --> 14:58.898
Is that a bite mark
on your leg?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.377
This little crazy guy
went after Toffee,

15:00.464 --> 15:02.292
Oh, man! And then Chewy
and Angel went down!

15:02.379 --> 15:04.251
So we brought down
a couple of theirs!

15:04.338 --> 15:06.906
Tit for tat, baby!

15:06.993 --> 15:08.603
[howling in distance]

15:08.690 --> 15:10.344
Oh, we're gonna settle this,
no matter what it costs!

15:10.431 --> 15:12.694
It's gonna go on and on
until the bitter end!

15:24.445 --> 15:25.794
They need me.

15:28.449 --> 15:33.193
$120, $140,
$160, $180.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.325
That'll have to do.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.240
I'm giving you
a good deal, kid.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.807
I didn't get
in this business

15:38.894 --> 15:41.114
so I could rip off
little children.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.942
Hey, you need a gun?

15:44.421 --> 15:46.032
[cheering and applause]

15:46.119 --> 15:48.904
Let's hear from some more
who aren't afraid!

15:48.991 --> 15:51.298
I'm gonna be a vice president
in two years!

15:53.213 --> 15:55.432
Hey, come on, he knows!

15:55.519 --> 15:57.608
I'm gonna get out of debt!

15:57.695 --> 16:00.524
Hey, she knows!

16:00.611 --> 16:03.397
I'm gonna have sex
with a member of every race!

16:05.007 --> 16:06.835
All right! All right!

16:06.922 --> 16:08.663
Now let's see who's next up.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.449
Gerry? Is there a Gerry Morrison
in the house?

16:12.536 --> 16:17.237
Oh, Gerry, it says here
that you turned down a promotion

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
four times.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.849
-ALL: Ooh...
-Lady Luck smiles,

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
but you give her the
ol' stink-eye.

16:22.503 --> 16:23.678
Gerry, what's going on?

16:23.765 --> 16:25.593
I guess I'm just frightened.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.030
I-I mean, I'm good
at what I do now,

16:28.117 --> 16:29.727
and if I start trying

16:29.814 --> 16:33.079
to move up the ladder, I'll
probably let everyone else down.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.995
Gerry, did you know
that Michael Jordan

16:36.082 --> 16:38.127
didn't even see
a basketball

16:38.214 --> 16:40.303
until he was 30 years old?

16:40.390 --> 16:41.870
No, no. I didn't know that.

16:41.957 --> 16:45.047
Who tied your tie
this morning, Gerry?

16:45.134 --> 16:45.961
I did.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.397
Somebody just came in,

16:47.484 --> 16:48.746
pulled up your pants,
shaved your face,

16:48.833 --> 16:50.313
combed back that
lovely head of hair?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.011
No. I did it all myself.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.840
You did it all by yourself.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.191
You were in charge
this morning, Gerry.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.280
But somehow when you
walked out that door,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.369
you let the world take over.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.153
Why did you do that?

17:04.240 --> 17:05.762
I don't know.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.940
Well, I do know, Gerry.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.378
It's because you
denied the giant

17:12.465 --> 17:13.944
that's inside you.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.730
You two. Get down on
your hands and knees.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.340
I actually have a bad back.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.779
Is that your back
talking, or your mind?

17:21.866 --> 17:22.954
Actually, it's my doctor.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.955
Or your doctor's mind?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.306
You tell your back

17:26.393 --> 17:29.135
it takes orders from you now.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.490
-Climb on top, Gerry.
-What?

17:36.577 --> 17:39.101
Climb on top like
the giant you are.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.756
Okay.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.410
[man groans]

17:43.497 --> 17:44.367
I think my back is...

17:44.454 --> 17:45.542
A bridge of steel!

17:45.629 --> 17:47.109
How does it feel,
Giant Gerry?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
Tall.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
[all cheer]

17:50.591 --> 17:51.940
Damn tall!

17:52.027 --> 17:53.855
All your life you've
been letting people

17:53.942 --> 17:54.943
call the shots for you.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.075
Well, no more!

17:56.162 --> 17:57.424
Today is the day.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.556
You're a giant,
Giant Gerry!

17:59.643 --> 18:01.210
[cheering]

18:01.297 --> 18:03.604
The world looks better
from up here.

18:03.691 --> 18:04.648
You bet it does!

18:04.735 --> 18:06.781
And that's where
you live now.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.653
So what are you
going to do, Giant Gerry?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.916
I'm gonna take
that promotion!

18:12.003 --> 18:13.744
And I'm gonna become head
of Systems Management!

18:13.831 --> 18:15.094
[cheering]

18:17.400 --> 18:20.142
I-I'm in Systems Management.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.578
Damn right you are!

18:21.665 --> 18:23.493
And I'm gonna take you
off these seminars

18:23.580 --> 18:25.887
and I'm gonna put you
on my team full time.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.932
[cheering]

18:28.019 --> 18:28.846
I'm gonna work
that department,

18:28.933 --> 18:30.500
and I'm gonna work it

18:30.587 --> 18:32.720
until it's the strongest one
in the whole company!

18:32.807 --> 18:34.156
[cheering]

18:34.243 --> 18:35.810
And I'm gonna push my workers

18:35.897 --> 18:37.507
until they've given me
everything that they've got.

18:37.594 --> 18:40.380
And then they can all say
good-bye to their families

18:40.467 --> 18:42.295
'cause I'm driving
straight to the top!

18:42.382 --> 18:44.906
[cheering]

18:44.993 --> 18:46.299
Yeah!

18:46.386 --> 18:48.518
Ha! Ha-ha-ha!

18:49.650 --> 18:52.827
[laughing, dogs barking]

18:55.264 --> 18:57.266
Man, that was amazing!

18:57.353 --> 18:58.398
They won't be leaving
any more messages

18:58.485 --> 18:59.747
on our side of the park!

18:59.834 --> 19:02.619
Where we going now, Lucky, huh?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.320
Lucky, where you leading us?

19:08.973 --> 19:10.975
[whimpering]

19:11.062 --> 19:12.803
Really?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.071
You guys mean it?

19:21.377 --> 19:23.074
All right, I won't
let you guys down.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
Let's roll!

19:24.250 --> 19:25.860
[barking]

19:30.038 --> 19:32.780
You found him
in a chicken coop?!

19:32.867 --> 19:35.130
It's hard to know exactly
what happened, ma'am.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.653
He and his friends appeared

19:36.740 --> 19:38.394
to have had themselves
quite a little party.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.441
They just don't train you
to handle a scene like that.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.225
The law's a little murky

19:43.312 --> 19:46.315
in this area, but when we
figure out how to charge him,

19:46.402 --> 19:48.012
I'll be back.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.674
I never thought
about how it would end.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.068
It just felt so cool
to belong.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.678
The important thing
is you're out.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.420
But my boys.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.814
They rounded us all up...

20:06.901 --> 20:10.731
then these vets came in,
and one by one...

20:10.818 --> 20:11.819
They killed them?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.908
No.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.605
But they're not
my boys anymore.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.697
-Mom...
-Dewey.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.221
I want to talk.

20:22.308 --> 20:25.485
I really don't feel up
to that right now.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.965
I know I hurt you,
and I'm very sorry.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.619
Thank you, Dewey.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.665
But words are cheap.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.710
I wanted to do something
that would show you

20:33.797 --> 20:35.408
I'm committed
to this relationship.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.975
I want you to know
how much you mean to me.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.630
I want you to know that no one
can take your place.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.593
I'm going back Tuesday.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.073
I passed out before they
colored in the drop-shadow.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.251
It's not that I don't
appreciate...

20:53.382 --> 20:54.992
We are going down
to the hospital

20:55.079 --> 20:57.908
and you're gonna have that
lasered off right this...

20:57.995 --> 21:01.956
Okay, I know
you're trying to...

21:02.043 --> 21:04.393
But what is wrong with...

21:06.352 --> 21:09.659
Oh! I never imagined
you would be willing to...

21:09.746 --> 21:12.009
But that is so stupid!

21:12.096 --> 21:15.099
Oh, look, they made a heart!

21:51.222 --> 21:53.616
