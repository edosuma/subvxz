WEBVTT

00:23.719 --> 00:26.330
We need Jose Battle
to keep the peace.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.680
We need Bumpy Johnson
to sell our dope in Harlem.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.378
Go fuck yourselves.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.555
Your friends ask you to
come and try to change my mind?

00:33.555 --> 00:37.037
I'd rather be friends
with an Alzado.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.083
I spoke with Assistant District
Attorney Pike today.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.259
He knows about your association
with Jose Battle.

00:42.259 --> 00:46.046
- Who do you want me to kill?
- Juan Madera, a journalist.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.092
I keep my promises.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.615
Better keep yours.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.053
I would love for you to come
with me to Africa.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.881
I'll need an executive assistant
to help with my affairs.

00:55.881 --> 00:59.059
- Travel to Africa with you?
- Who better than you?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.973
How long are you
keeping me here for?

01:00.973 --> 01:03.889
Someone tried
to have you killed.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.762
I made a promise to your pops
that I'd look after you.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.894
- This is an easy gig here.
- What if I quit?

01:08.894 --> 01:10.200
Then you stay in your room.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.375
We'll discuss salary
over dinner.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.724
Fine.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.162
There's no reason
why we can't be friends.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.122
I'll take him back
to French Connection.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.472
We found Monsieur 98.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.126
Who scares you the most?

01:23.126 --> 01:24.562
Bonnano or me?

01:26.477 --> 01:28.088
I will take your side.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.741
Three thousand keys.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.613
With the biggest
duji shipment in history.

01:37.314 --> 01:41.492
So, I received this postcard
from our man in Marseilles.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.842
His name is Jean Cesar,

01:43.842 --> 01:47.759
but he's better known
as Monsieur 98.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.631
Well, in case
you didn't know it,

01:49.631 --> 01:52.503
we've been dealing
with these fuckin' frogs

01:52.503 --> 01:54.505
before you had diapers on.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.507
What are you saying?

01:56.507 --> 01:58.640
I'm saying that
on the last shipment,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.859
Bumpy Johnson made you all
look like idiots.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.166
- Hey, hey, you fuckin'--
- Hey, Carlo, let him talk.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.515
What are you saying?

02:04.515 --> 02:06.256
If he hadn't had
the rotten luck

02:06.256 --> 02:08.040
for the dope
to burn up in those riots,

02:08.040 --> 02:10.782
he'd be in control
of the connection right now.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.437
As it is, Monsieur 98
is coming soon

02:13.437 --> 02:15.309
to work out an arrangement
with anyone

02:15.309 --> 02:18.007
that has the organization
and the police protection

02:18.007 --> 02:20.444
to move the junk
into the neighborhoods.

02:20.444 --> 02:23.012
Where does Chin stand
on all this?

02:23.012 --> 02:26.363
He's authorized me
to negotiate a deal,

02:26.363 --> 02:28.800
with your approval, of course,

02:28.800 --> 02:31.803
and to keep Bumpy Johnson away
from this deal at all costs.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.154
Good luck with that.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.633
See this?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.505
This nigger was just put in
as the captain

02:37.505 --> 02:39.507
of the 27th Precinct.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.727
Him and Johnson are gonna be
thick as thieves.

02:42.727 --> 02:46.731
Listen, this guy was installed
to calm the Blacks in Harlem

02:46.731 --> 02:49.865
after the riots
so they see a Black face.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.911
That's it. He's a figurehead.
Nothing more.

02:52.911 --> 02:57.655
No one could move dope in Harlem
<i>without</i> the 27th in pocket.

02:57.655 --> 03:01.398
Not you, not me,
not even Johnson.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.316
Calm down, fellas.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.450
Cops don't give a flying fuck
about Black or white.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.583
It's all about green.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.572
Listen.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.228
We're not gonna have
a problem, right?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.882
There's always problems
when you move the duji.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.058
No, I mean
with this new cop,

03:53.058 --> 03:55.452
this new captain guy--
he's not gonna fuck us up?

03:55.452 --> 03:59.369
It depends on whether he bleeds
Black or he bleeds blue.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.067
I'm more worried about Colombo
and the Families.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.983
They've always been able to work
things out with the cops.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.772
Everyone down on
the fucking floor right now!

04:12.382 --> 04:14.993
Everyone!

04:16.995 --> 04:18.432
- Get down, you motherfuckers.
- Get down!

04:18.432 --> 04:20.303
Everybody down
on the fucking ground!

04:20.303 --> 04:21.565
Get down on the fucking floor.
Are you stupid?

04:21.565 --> 04:23.567
- Get the fuck down.
- You can't hear me?

04:23.567 --> 04:26.744
Everybody down
on the floor now!

04:26.744 --> 04:30.052
Get the fuck down
on the floor now, everyone!

My fucking house?

06:07.976 --> 06:10.239
Do cops usually
come after you like this?

06:10.239 --> 06:12.067
No.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.765
I got cops on the pad
to protect this place.

06:14.765 --> 06:18.552
Maybe somebody's paying them
more money to stand aside.

06:18.552 --> 06:22.512
I didn't recognize those two,
but I saw their brass.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.514
They're from the 27th.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.734
Motherfuckers took money
outta the tip jar,

06:26.734 --> 06:28.736
but didn't even go back
and look for a safe.

06:28.736 --> 06:32.522
Fucking intimidation move.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.699
Colombo sending a message?

06:35.699 --> 06:39.790
Yeah, well, he sees that you
and me, we're raking it in.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.097
It's a fuck-you.

06:42.097 --> 06:45.230
How about we get some men
and we go hit <i>him</i> back?

06:45.230 --> 06:48.146
It's not about
tit for tat.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.235
This is about the heroin.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.412
Colombo's making his play.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.891
Shipment's coming in.

06:53.891 --> 06:57.591
If he gets the 27th,
we're fucked.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.179
Bon voyage.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.359
<i>The people of Harlem need
to trust their men in uniform,</i>

07:27.359 --> 07:29.666
<i>and we need
to earn their trust.</i>

07:29.666 --> 07:31.973
<i>For too long, policing in
Harlem has been</i>

07:31.973 --> 07:35.759
<i>billy club first,
questions later, if at all,</i>

07:35.759 --> 07:38.327
<i>and I can promise you
that will change.</i>

07:39.502 --> 07:43.288
Oh, thank God you're okay.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.899
They shot up the place.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.772
- Cops?
- In uniform.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.295
I'm telling you,
those cops were bought

07:50.295 --> 07:51.601
and paid for by the guineas.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.127
You know what, Elsworth?

07:56.127 --> 07:57.215
There might be a way
you can deal with this

07:57.215 --> 08:00.480
by going
right to the source.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.177
What do you mean?

08:02.177 --> 08:04.875
Well, Reggie Fields
was just on the news--

08:04.875 --> 08:06.181
the new police captain.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.530
I met him with Roy Wingate
last week.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.663
He is an honest, good man.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.012
And he's Black.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.712
What difference
does that make?

08:15.712 --> 08:17.148
Well, he says he wants to make
a difference in Harlem,

08:17.148 --> 08:18.628
and I believe him.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.543
If there are dirty, corrupt cops
on his force,

08:20.543 --> 08:22.153
he should know about it.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.025
I also have cops on the pad, Mayme.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.204
Look.

08:29.204 --> 08:33.034
They don't steal from
legitimate businesses.

08:33.034 --> 08:36.864
You are a Black business owner.
You have rights.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.867
You think this new captain
gives a shit about me?

08:39.867 --> 08:41.521
He should.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.177
You're always looking out
for me, aren't you?

08:46.177 --> 08:48.179
Just talk to him,

08:48.179 --> 08:50.530
make him aware
of the situation.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.327
It feels like we landed
in a postcard.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.852
If I remember
the guidebook,

09:08.852 --> 09:11.420
that's the Great Pyramid
of Giza.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.378
You're not homesick yet?

09:13.378 --> 09:15.903
Harlem has its glory, but...

09:15.903 --> 09:19.123
Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan--

09:19.123 --> 09:21.082
Africa's starting to feel
like my real home.

09:21.082 --> 09:25.260
Yeah, you're hearing
our ancestors' voices clearly

09:25.260 --> 09:28.263
for the first time,

09:28.263 --> 09:31.875
unfiltered by
the fog of prejudice.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.096
I bet it soothes your soul
as it does mine.

09:37.968 --> 09:41.232
You have tea with President
Gamal Abdel Nasser at 4:00

09:41.232 --> 09:44.148
and then dinner with President
Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria,

09:44.148 --> 09:45.410
if you can manage.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.716
Call them both
and reschedule.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.065
Why?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.458
Che Guevara wants
to meet with me today.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.591
The Cuban revolutionary.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.419
He sent me a telegram
when we were both in Accra.

09:54.419 --> 09:57.640
He wants to meet before I speak
at the Pan-African Conference.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.121
I'll clear your schedule.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.644
Anything else?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.080
I'm gonna go to that bazaar
near the hotel.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.647
I want to get a gift
for Margaret.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.737
Look, I don't want you to leave
this hotel on your own.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.130
Why?

10:09.130 --> 10:12.437
All over Africa,
I've gone as I pleased.

10:12.437 --> 10:15.005
Egypt is a different beast.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.660
There are proprieties in place,
especially for women.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.272
It's far more stringent
than in West Africa.

10:21.272 --> 10:24.624
I think you should
stay in your room.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.670
I will, as soon as I finish
arranging your schedule.

10:41.858 --> 10:45.383
Here is your money.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.995
Thank you for a job well done.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.522
What exactly was the point
of all that bullshit?

10:53.522 --> 10:57.700
Call it the fine art
of negotiation.

10:57.700 --> 11:01.312
Now, how many cops
does Johnson still have

11:01.312 --> 11:02.966
in his pocket at the 27?

11:02.966 --> 11:06.404
Look at the bodacious tatas
on this girl.

11:06.404 --> 11:09.016
Jesus mother of Mary.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.844
Still gonna be a while
till we find out which cops

11:10.844 --> 11:12.584
Johnson controls.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.413
What about
this new captain?

11:15.413 --> 11:18.242
I need him on my pad
when the shipment comes in.

11:18.242 --> 11:21.811
With Chin Gigante gone,
you're making a play, huh?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
The fuck are
you talking about?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.382
What?

11:27.382 --> 11:30.211
I'm holding down the fort
<i>for</i> Chin Gigante.

11:30.211 --> 11:34.737
They key is neutralizing
Bumpy Johnson.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.739
How the fuck
we supposed to do that?

11:36.739 --> 11:37.827
Arrest him.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.350
On what charge?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.570
I don't fucking know.
Who cares?

11:41.570 --> 11:44.573
I just need to show him
who's boss around here.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.402
Maybe a couple days at Rikers
will change his attitude.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.276
Yeah.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.194
Thanks for seeing me,
Captain Fields.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.893
My wife-- she speaks
very highly of you.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.723
According to this report,
Mr. Johnson,

12:03.723 --> 12:07.030
your Geechee club is open past
the hours of legal operation.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.598
Most of the clubs in Harlem
do that, Captain,

12:09.598 --> 12:11.774
as you must well know.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.951
My place was shot up
by your police officers

12:14.951 --> 12:16.866
for no reason whatsoever.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.781
Well, that's quite
an accusation.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.609
I mean,
I didn't recognize them,

12:20.609 --> 12:24.918
but they were wearing uniforms
and 27th Precinct badges.

12:24.918 --> 12:28.095
My question is,
what are you doing about it?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.749
If what you say is true,

12:29.749 --> 12:32.403
an independent counsel
would have to be convened,

12:32.403 --> 12:34.666
which would take considerable
amounts of time and money.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.103
That's an excellent idea.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.757
Resources which could
be used instead

12:37.757 --> 12:40.498
to investigate racketeering, prostitution,

12:40.498 --> 12:42.979
loan sharking, numbers running,
and dope peddling.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.808
But not police corruption,
I guess.

12:45.808 --> 12:49.769
Johnson, let's get
past the bullshit.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.118
Mm.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.989
I know who you are
and your long rap sheet.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.600
I also know the many things
you do to help the community,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.907
like all those kids
you help send to college.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.344
I do what I can.
What about you?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.912
Well, there are many things
I need to concern myself with,

13:02.912 --> 13:05.654
and dirty cops
<i>is</i> one of them.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.787
But so are mob bosses,

13:07.787 --> 13:09.658
both Italian and Black.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.706
Your complaint is
duly noted.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.708
I guess that means
that you're not gonna do

13:16.708 --> 13:19.276
a goddamn thing about it, then.

13:19.276 --> 13:24.804
Know this-- if you can't keep
your cops under control,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.850
you can bet your Black ass
that I will.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.477
Nice of you to show up.

13:46.477 --> 13:49.045
Oh, I didn't know you kept
strict business hours.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.525
Yeah, I don't,

13:50.525 --> 13:52.832
but a little discipline
wouldn't hurt.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.311
Well, that's not gonna
help me much,

13:54.311 --> 13:57.227
seeing I don't do nothing
but take messages for you.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.841
That's right.
You take messages for me.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.364
And I'm keeping you alive.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.540
Seems like
a fair trade to me.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.585
Keeping me alive for what?

14:07.585 --> 14:09.500
I'm bored. I'm lonely.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.676
I can't go anywhere
or do anything.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.287
I have no friends.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.688
What can I do to put a smile
on that pretty face of yours?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.908
You can give me
my freedom.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.170
Let me go to Paris.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.872
I get that you're bored
and lonely.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.006
How about that Negro lady
you saw in Philly?

14:37.006 --> 14:38.921
You want I should bring her
up here for a visit?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.705
The last thing I want
is your fucking goons

14:40.705 --> 14:42.185
running in on her
with their guns

14:42.185 --> 14:44.753
and forcing her
to do anything.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.928
Okay.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.105
You're such
a fucking asshole!

14:49.105 --> 14:50.715
Forget I mentioned it.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.370
Forget I offered
to do anything!

14:53.370 --> 14:54.937
You're such an ungrateful
little bitch.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.808
If I didn't make a promise
to your father

14:56.808 --> 14:58.027
that I'd keep you safe,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.073
I'd consider
whacking you myself!

15:03.076 --> 15:05.295
Fuck you!

15:08.646 --> 15:11.649
Malcolm X in the flesh.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.739
Che Guevara.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.133
What an honor
to finally meet you.

15:17.133 --> 15:21.268
Fidel, uh, often spoke
about his wonderful trip

15:21.268 --> 15:24.401
to Harlem and your gifts
as an orator.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.403
He described you

15:26.403 --> 15:29.754
as "America's
number-one revolutionary."

15:29.754 --> 15:32.061
I'm pleased by Fidel's
kind words.

15:32.061 --> 15:35.978
They are his words,
not mine.

15:35.978 --> 15:39.764
I would not call you
a revolutionary.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.679
How would you
describe me, then?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.551
If you don't mind
my asking.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.774
As an advocate, perhaps,

15:49.774 --> 15:52.995
but a revolutionary fights
with more than just his words.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.258
He takes action.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.957
I have never backed down
from a fight.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.350
You are Minister Malcolm X.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.961
If you sound a war cry,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.485
all of heaven and Earth
will take arms.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.532
This is about the speech
I'm making

16:08.532 --> 16:10.491
at the Pan-African Conference.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.449
You can be of great service.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.886
I need the African leaders
to lend their support

16:14.886 --> 16:17.977
to the worldwide struggle
for liberation.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.328
They eat out of your hands.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.851
They listen to you.

16:22.851 --> 16:26.333
I am here to talk about
<i>our</i> people's

16:26.333 --> 16:30.032
political struggle
in the United States.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.469
You're always talking
about the crimes committed

16:32.469 --> 16:33.862
against your people

16:33.862 --> 16:36.212
by racist forces
in <i>your</i> country.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.735
They are too great
to mention.

16:37.735 --> 16:40.129
If you can't see that
your country is committing

16:40.129 --> 16:42.523
these crimes
all over the world,

16:42.523 --> 16:44.351
then why are you here?

16:47.528 --> 16:50.139
Or is it just to see
the pyramids?

17:02.586 --> 17:03.935
Who is it?

17:03.935 --> 17:05.589
Hotel security.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.856
How can I help you?

17:11.856 --> 17:14.033
Is Malcolm El Shabazz present?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.904
No, I'm sorry.
He's at a meeting.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.037
Are you the assistant
to Malcolm El Shabazz?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.603
Yes.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.735
Please come with me.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.084
Why?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.868
Please follow me.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.401
Thank you.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.406
I'm sure you're wondering
why hotel security

17:39.406 --> 17:40.755
asked you down here.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.191
No one asked me.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
If they had,
I wouldn't have come.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.545
Fair enough.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.199
My name is
Gregory Reynolds.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.766
I'm with the U.S.
State Department.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.463
I wanted to have
a little talk with you

17:53.463 --> 17:56.292
about Malcolm El Shabazz.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.902
What about him?

17:57.902 --> 17:59.121
Well, we understand
that you've been traveling

17:59.121 --> 18:01.906
as his secretary
throughout Africa,

18:01.906 --> 18:03.647
and that he trusts you.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.736
Why not talk to him
yourself?

18:05.736 --> 18:09.218
We both know he's a very
proud man and stubborn,

18:09.218 --> 18:11.177
and doesn't always
listen to reason.

18:14.528 --> 18:15.572
We don't want him
to give a speech

18:15.572 --> 18:17.748
at the Pan-African Conference.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.141
Why?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.925
We know that Malcolm
and Che Guevara

18:20.925 --> 18:22.753
have been in communication.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.625
Spreading communist propaganda
in Africa

18:24.625 --> 18:27.454
is against
our national interest.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.369
Who exactly are you?

18:31.458 --> 18:35.026
Africa's a tinder box
right now.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.246
Wars breaking out all over.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.769
The Communists would like
nothing more

18:38.769 --> 18:41.032
than to form
a stronghold here.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.774
What in the world does that
have to do with Malcolm?

18:43.774 --> 18:46.603
When he talks
about things like...

18:46.603 --> 18:50.129
liberation and resistance,

18:50.129 --> 18:54.872
it's just a <i>very</i> short hop
to socialism and communism.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.526
Malcolm is no communist.

18:58.049 --> 19:01.444
Look, he's free to say
whatever he wants

19:01.444 --> 19:03.881
on American soil.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.796
But in Egypt,
the State Department would

19:05.796 --> 19:07.798
prefer he cancel
his speech.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.496
No way
he's gonna cancel.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.547
Rumor has it that someone
from Mosque Number Seven

19:17.547 --> 19:20.028
in New York City
tried to kill him.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.682
Is that correct?

19:23.945 --> 19:26.382
I have no idea.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.994
Miss Johnson,

19:29.994 --> 19:31.822
I know you care
about this man,

19:31.822 --> 19:33.868
and, believe it or not,
so do I.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.480
I want to see
that he makes it home safe.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.048
He certainly doesn't need
more enemies.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.054
Only one?

19:46.054 --> 19:48.012
What?

19:48.012 --> 19:51.233
We had two dozen patrol and
three detectives on our books.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.236
I want to know
what the fuck happened.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.673
We-- We did the footwork
like you asked.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.414
And these cops
we've known for years

19:58.414 --> 20:00.416
barely even <i>willing</i>
to talk to us.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.376
Whoever got to our cops either
put the fear of God in 'em

20:03.376 --> 20:05.116
or is paying them
a whole lot more.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.858
Either way, Colombo.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.338
Any luck with
that new captain?

20:09.338 --> 20:10.687
Useless.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.211
Another token Negro
to con our people

20:12.211 --> 20:13.864
into thinking
that things are changing.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.258
Now what about those fuckers
who hit the Geechee?

20:16.258 --> 20:18.086
Still making inquiries.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.090
Without cops on our pad,

20:22.090 --> 20:25.615
we're looking at a life sentence
if we get pinched.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.443
What do you suggest?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.970
What about D'Alessandro?

20:32.970 --> 20:36.278
Nah, nah, he ain't in the 27th.
He's Midtown.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.801
I don't care.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.760
If you want information
about dirty cops,

20:39.760 --> 20:42.110
you ask a dirty cop.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.677
Get me D'Alessandro.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.900
So let me
get this straight.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.295
Joseph Colombo
is keeping you prisoner?

20:53.295 --> 20:55.906
At my father's request.

20:55.906 --> 20:59.432
He's worried one of the other
Families might try to kill me.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.651
So how exactly are you
a prisoner?

21:01.651 --> 21:04.263
He got me an apartment
where I gotta stay.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.266
I work for him in his office
at the car lot.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.311
He has guards on me
all the time.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.791
The only reason
I'm here right now

21:10.791 --> 21:15.665
is 'cause I told them
I had a gynecological exam.

21:15.665 --> 21:19.278
So you're in close proximity
to Joe Colombo.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.018
Unfortunately, yes.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.809
Want Joe Colombo
out of your hair for good?

21:31.725 --> 21:34.118
We've been picking up chatter
about a huge shipment of heroin

21:34.118 --> 21:36.425
coming into New York.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.645
Connect him
to that shipment,

21:38.645 --> 21:40.777
and we'll put him away
for life.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.953
How the hell am I supposed
to do that?

21:42.953 --> 21:44.999
Get a couple glasses of wine
in these guys,

21:44.999 --> 21:47.175
they'll tell you
the riddle of the Sphinx.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.785
So you want me
to do your job for you

21:48.785 --> 21:51.048
and maybe
get myself killed?

21:51.048 --> 21:52.702
No, thanks.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.704
I'll make sure you get
a new identity, new life,

21:54.704 --> 21:56.402
under federal protection.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.189
Can you do that for me
in Paris?

22:05.062 --> 22:07.369
Normally we don't protect
people internationally.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.983
But you put Colombo in jail,

22:12.983 --> 22:15.029
you'll be walking
on the Champs-Elysées.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.210
What would I have to do?

22:23.298 --> 22:24.908
Bumpy, I'm sorry.

22:24.908 --> 22:28.390
I'm Midtown these days,
not anywhere near the 27th.

22:28.390 --> 22:32.002
I'm looking for the two
dirty cops who shot up my joint.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.482
How much would it cost me
to find out?

22:33.482 --> 22:35.658
It ain't about money.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.356
I won't be able to get a peep
out of no one.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.879
That new boss, Colombo--

22:38.879 --> 22:40.707
he's got everyone
on his payroll.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.666
Apparently, the next
shipment's gonna be huge.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.016
I need you to try.

22:46.016 --> 22:49.368
If they think I'm sniffing
around for <i>you,</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:52.675
I'll get my balls
chopped off, honest.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.198
Remind me how much money
you made

22:54.198 --> 22:56.157
when I stole that duji
out of that police locker?

22:57.767 --> 23:01.075
I bet it put your kids
through college.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.730
There's more of that
if you can help me out.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.083
I'll do my best.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.737
I appreciate it.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.665
That crooked cop ain't gonna
do shit, right?

23:29.582 --> 23:31.453
What you thinkin', boss?

23:31.453 --> 23:34.413
We got the signal from
Marseilles dope's coming soon.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.942
I'm thinking...

23:41.942 --> 23:43.944
we gotta set a meeting
with Colombo.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.078
Him and me.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.654
He knew about
your meeting with Che.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.482
I didn't know what to say.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.963
State Department, my ass.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.838
That man was pure CIA.

24:08.838 --> 24:12.581
The U.S. government trying to
intimidate me, even overseas.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.930
That's not good.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.758
It is.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.805

under their skin.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.329
I know how important
this speech is

24:21.329 --> 24:22.983
and how much you've
accomplished already.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.637
All over the continent,
you've talked about the need

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
for Black liberation.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.378
And I have to continue.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.945
This speech is
the pinnacle.

24:28.945 --> 24:32.079
I know.
I'm just a little concerned.

24:35.386 --> 24:39.521
I'm not going to let anyone
keep me from my work.

24:39.521 --> 24:40.957
Nor should you,

24:40.957 --> 24:43.786
but that man scared me.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.527
This isn't a game.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.965
Nobody knows that
more than me.

24:48.965 --> 24:52.882
Malcolm,
I have a bad feeling.

25:21.650 --> 25:25.262
Well, here we are again.

25:25.262 --> 25:28.831
Putting those cops on my club
was a big mistake.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.051
What makes you think
those were <i>my</i> cops?

25:31.051 --> 25:34.228
Stop with the bullshit.
I know you got the 27th.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.446
That ain't gonna stop me
from getting the heroin

25:35.446 --> 25:37.753

when it drops.

25:37.753 --> 25:41.757
You're in no position
to make threats, Johnson.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.586
But I'm a reasonable man.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.196
I'm willing to negotiate.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.024
You never give up,
do you?

25:48.024 --> 25:49.591
I get what I want.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.766
And what is that?

25:50.766 --> 25:52.768
When the shipment comes in,

25:52.768 --> 25:55.205
there'll be a fight
for who controls it.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.424
- Yeah.
- No!

25:56.424 --> 25:58.469
I'm gonna get the dope,
all of it.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.559
But I am gonna need
your help selling it.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.690
It's that simple.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.213
I don't work
for you, Joe.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.956
You know, Bumpy,

26:06.956 --> 26:09.306
you're always talking about

26:09.306 --> 26:10.786
how the Blacks
are mistreated.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.049
Listen, I don't disagree,

26:13.049 --> 26:16.444
so I made you a good offer
by any measure,

26:16.444 --> 26:18.098
a-and you turn me down.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.621
Again and again.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.058
Then you talk about
being locked in a cage?

26:22.058 --> 26:24.147
That's your own bullshit.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.716
To be honest, I got half a mind
to think <i>you're</i> a racist.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.153
You want to make a deal
right now?

26:30.153 --> 26:32.634
Equal partners.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.070
50-50.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.768
50-50 you want?

26:35.768 --> 26:38.988
It's too late for you
to dictate terms.

26:38.988 --> 26:43.602
I stood up for a fair deal
on your behalf to the Families.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.343
You made me look foolish
in their eyes.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.913
Especially when you conned
Jose Battle to your side.

26:50.913 --> 26:55.178
And so
with all due respect,

26:55.178 --> 26:58.834
you can go fuck yourself.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.488
That's what I thought.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.624
Listen, those cops are gonna
be cracking down

27:05.624 --> 27:08.627
on every fuckin' place
you and Battle own.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.498
You can't control
all of the cops.

27:10.498 --> 27:13.109
Well...

27:13.109 --> 27:15.677
...I control
more than you.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.158
Come here.
I want to show you something.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.303
He was asking a lot of
questions, from what I'm told.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.324
You're willing to let
a little CIA hide-and-seek

27:54.324 --> 27:56.849
scare you
out of your mission?

27:56.849 --> 27:58.633
They targeted
my assistant.

28:00.591 --> 28:04.378
If anything happened to Elise,
I'd never forgive myself.

28:05.074 --> 28:09.383
Safety is a luxury
revolutionaries cannot afford.

28:09.383 --> 28:13.517
You have to decide
what is more important--

28:13.517 --> 28:16.912
your cause or your life.

28:16.912 --> 28:21.047
I am willing to die
for what I believe in,

28:21.047 --> 28:23.440
as long as others aren't
put in danger beside me.

28:23.440 --> 28:28.010
You are sounding a war cry
for your people the world over.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.447
You could fire a bullet
that ricochets

28:30.447 --> 28:32.754
all the way back
to Washington.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.193
Or you can run and hide.

28:47.029 --> 28:51.381
You really think the CIA will
kill you for giving that speech?

28:51.381 --> 28:52.774
They've done far worse.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.559
You've been roaming
this continent for weeks,

28:59.041 --> 29:03.045
If they wanted you dead, <i>camarada,</i>

29:03.045 --> 29:04.786
they would've
killed you already.

29:18.452 --> 29:22.064
I see you're actually doing
something around here.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.500
Your paperwork is
such a mess,

29:23.500 --> 29:27.113
I decided to try
and organize things a bit.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.984
Oh.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.639
Uh, thank you.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.964

30:00.233 --> 30:01.800
So, no hard feelings?

30:04.193 --> 30:05.804
No.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.179

36:37.586 --> 36:40.763
What's wrong?

36:40.763 --> 36:44.854
I just...
find it very strange

36:44.854 --> 36:47.727
that he would share
this kind of stuff with you.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.773
Yeah, yeah,
"this thing of ours,"

36:50.773 --> 36:52.253
it doesn't include women.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.950
I get it.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.518
But he trusts me.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.041
And I told him
you're doing a great job

36:58.041 --> 37:01.784
holding down the fort
while he's away.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.264
Well, thank you.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.961
He said the sooner
you get that shipment,

37:04.961 --> 37:07.442
the stronger you'll be,
and the safer I'll be.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.057
Tell your father that

37:14.057 --> 37:18.192
I'm expecting Monsieur 98
any day to negotiate prices.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.717
After that, I'll arrange
for the load to come in

37:21.717 --> 37:25.460
through my shipment
of car parts.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.246
He'll be glad
to hear that.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.117
I know it'll put his mind
at ease.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.130
Well, thank you
for an incredible meal.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.088
You're welcome.

37:45.088 --> 37:48.004
You know, the truth is,

37:48.004 --> 37:50.311
I don't have
a lot of friends,

37:50.311 --> 37:53.183
so when you said
that thing you said

37:53.183 --> 37:57.013
about being lonely...

37:57.013 --> 37:58.624
I understood that.

38:00.974 --> 38:04.282
I don't want
to be your enemy.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.327
I'd prefer to consider you
a friend.

38:11.463 --> 38:15.031
You know,
a-and when you...

38:15.031 --> 38:16.816
talked to the Feds,
that--

38:16.816 --> 38:20.950
that was you being
insane with grief.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.823
You ain't a rat for real,
Stell'.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.825
It ain't
in your blood.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.392
No.

38:30.003 --> 38:33.354
Thanks again
for a great evening.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.095
I'll see you soon.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.968
All right.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.256
Praise Allah.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.258
What happened?

39:08.258 --> 39:10.565
Easy.
Not so fast.

39:10.565 --> 39:14.221
Aside from a few stomach fits,
you were out all night.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.224
I've never had food poisoning
this bad.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.660
I don't think
it was food poisoning.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.184
I think
it was poisoned food.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.753
Many foreigners come here
and get sick.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.103
Malcolm, I think this was
an attempt on your life.

39:27.103 --> 39:30.019
I think you should
cancel your speech.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.674
Not a chance.

39:32.674 --> 39:35.721
My speech is
in less than an hour.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.375
I feel fine.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.680
Oh.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.727
Doctor,
is he safe?

39:41.727 --> 39:43.293
Will he be all right?

39:43.293 --> 39:46.384
My recommendation is
he stay in bed and rest.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.515
No.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.387
We should listen
to the doctor.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.916
If anything happens to me,
it would be Allah's will.

39:58.961 --> 40:02.400
We must submit to His plans,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.924
even if they don't
coincide with ours.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.117
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.473
Well, did he say anything
about the heroin shipment?

40:32.473 --> 40:34.432
Anything at all.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.086
He didn't know
anything about it.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.741
Now, if you ask me,
Joe Colombo's clean.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.319
What the fuck is this?

40:52.319 --> 40:53.494
I don't know.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.844
I mean, I did everything
you said.

40:55.844 --> 40:58.717
Is it my fault your stupid
machinery doesn't do the job?

41:21.479 --> 41:22.871
Hey.

41:22.871 --> 41:24.786
Excuse me, "offisher"?

41:24.786 --> 41:27.136
Now, get a look at this guy.

41:27.136 --> 41:31.227
How 'bout a little drink
for you hard-working men, mm?

41:31.227 --> 41:34.187
Touch that bottle
after your nigger lips?

41:34.187 --> 41:35.971
I don't think so!

41:38.844 --> 41:42.717
Hey, out of the car, peckerwoods.

41:42.717 --> 41:45.415
You're coming with us.

41:45.415 --> 41:47.113
Take it easy.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.903
<i>I am honored to attend</i>

41:54.903 --> 41:58.254
<i>this historic
African Summit Conference</i>

41:58.254 --> 41:59.995
<i>to represent the interests</i>

41:59.995 --> 42:03.912
<i>of 22 million
African Americans</i>

42:03.912 --> 42:07.176
<i>whose rights
are being violated daily</i>

42:07.176 --> 42:10.919
<i>by the racism
of American imperialists.</i>

42:10.919 --> 42:16.098
We in America are your
long-lost brothers and sisters.

42:16.098 --> 42:19.449
<i>We were taken forcibly
in chains</i>

42:19.449 --> 42:21.277
<i>from this mother continent</i>

42:21.277 --> 42:26.282
<i>and now have spent
over 300 years in America,</i>

42:26.282 --> 42:29.372
<i>suffering the most inhuman forms</i>

42:29.372 --> 42:33.115
<i>of physical and psychological
torture imaginable.</i>

42:33.115 --> 42:35.683
You guys don't look
so tough now, do you?

42:35.683 --> 42:38.207
<i>And all of these
inhuman atrocities</i>

42:38.207 --> 42:40.601
<i>have been inflicted upon us</i>

42:40.601 --> 42:43.473
<i>by the American
governmental authorities,</i>

42:43.473 --> 42:47.042
<i>the police themselves,
for no reason</i>

42:47.042 --> 42:50.916
<i>other than that we seek
the recognition and respect</i>

42:50.916 --> 42:54.223
<i>granted to other
human beings in America.</i>

42:54.223 --> 42:56.878
<i>A hundred years ago,
the American white men</i>

42:56.878 --> 42:58.619
<i>used to put on a white sheet</i>

42:58.619 --> 43:00.752
<i>and use a bloodhound
against Negroes.</i>

43:00.752 --> 43:02.797
<i>Today, they've taken off
the white sheet</i>

43:02.797 --> 43:04.625
<i>and put on police uniforms</i>

43:04.625 --> 43:08.586
<i>and traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs.</i>

43:08.586 --> 43:10.631
I need to know
every single cop

43:10.631 --> 43:12.502
that Joe Colombo's
got on his payroll.

43:12.502 --> 43:14.287
We don't know shit.

43:15.984 --> 43:17.420
Aah!

43:17.420 --> 43:19.509
Who are the cops
on Colombo's pad?

43:19.509 --> 43:22.164
Fuck you.

43:22.164 --> 43:24.297
Open your fucking mouth!

43:24.297 --> 43:26.516
<i>Now, I'm not saying every
white person is a racist,</i>

43:26.516 --> 43:30.651
<i>and I'm not saying every white
policeman is a racist either.</i>

43:34.437 --> 43:35.482
Tell him what
he wants to know.

43:35.482 --> 43:37.615
Colombo's pad?

43:37.615 --> 43:39.442
I don't know.
No, no.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.270
<i>But both here
in the United States</i>

43:41.270 --> 43:42.794
<i>and here in Africa,</i>

43:42.794 --> 43:46.145
<i>we face forces that
would seek to divide us.</i>

43:46.145 --> 43:47.668
Come on!

43:47.668 --> 43:49.757
<i>That is why,
if things don't change,</i>

43:49.757 --> 43:52.020
<i>we must call
for revolution.</i>

43:53.631 --> 43:57.156
<i>African leaders,
our problem is your problem.</i>

43:57.156 --> 43:59.811
<i>You will never be
fully respected</i>

43:59.811 --> 44:04.119
<i>until and unless
we are also respected.</i>

44:04.119 --> 44:06.469
<i>You will never be recognized</i>

44:06.469 --> 44:08.994
<i>as free human beings
until and unless</i>

44:08.994 --> 44:12.650
<i>we are also recognized
as human beings.</i>

44:12.650 --> 44:15.130
<i>And so it is high time,</i>

44:15.130 --> 44:17.306
<i>should this oppression continue,</i>

44:17.306 --> 44:19.787
<i>to choose whether
we will ignore</i>

44:19.787 --> 44:22.485
<i>our commonality
in this struggle</i>

44:22.485 --> 44:24.879
and be divided,

44:24.879 --> 44:27.534
or work in solidarity

44:27.534 --> 44:30.798
as African brothers
and sisters

44:30.798 --> 44:32.321
the world over.

44:47.772 --> 44:48.729
What's this?

44:48.729 --> 44:50.426
Resignations.

44:50.426 --> 44:53.125
From the two crooked cops
who shot up my club.

44:54.866 --> 44:56.171
And how'd you get this?

44:56.171 --> 44:59.218
I guess... they had
a guilty conscience.

45:00.306 --> 45:01.960
Here are their badges.

45:04.963 --> 45:07.922
Did you hurt these men?

45:07.922 --> 45:10.098
What if I did?

45:10.098 --> 45:13.275
What are you gonna
do about it?

45:13.275 --> 45:14.929
I can do plenty.

45:14.929 --> 45:17.845
I don't think so.

45:17.845 --> 45:22.110
I got their signed confessions
on paper.

45:22.110 --> 45:24.765
They told me the name
of every single cop

45:24.765 --> 45:27.768
in this precinct
who's taking money from the mob,

45:27.768 --> 45:31.729
including--
♪ da-da-da-daa--

45:31.729 --> 45:33.513
you.

45:35.428 --> 45:38.474
And what are you gonna
do with that?

45:38.474 --> 45:39.780
That depends on you.

45:39.780 --> 45:43.131
I made copies
for safekeeping.

45:43.131 --> 45:45.481
If I didn't take
the pad money,

45:45.481 --> 45:48.397
every cop in this precinct
would rebel against me.

45:48.397 --> 45:49.921
They hate me enough
as it is.

45:49.921 --> 45:51.400
So you threaten me,

45:51.400 --> 45:52.967
but you keep your hands off
the Italians?

45:52.967 --> 45:55.665
I wish I could
jail all of you.

45:55.665 --> 45:58.146
But the culture here
ain't gonna change overnight.

45:58.146 --> 46:00.888
I have to make compromises
and do the best I can

46:00.888 --> 46:02.411
with this
fucked-up situation.

46:02.411 --> 46:04.283
You need to figure out
who your enemies are--

46:04.283 --> 46:05.980
your real enemies.

46:08.113 --> 46:11.638
Until then, motherfucker,
