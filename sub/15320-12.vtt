that you put me through yesterday.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.934
You have no rights.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.557
No rights!

Please. You’ve
been AWOL for 10 years.
No word, no alimony, nothing.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.253
Look, Jack and I are doing fine.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.291
So why don’t you do us and yourself
a favor and go home to Chicago?

02:03.874 --> 02:06.707
Was that little man?
Little man’s deadbeat dad.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.827
Sounded like you were
tearin’ him a new one.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.874
That’s who Jack
was with yesterday.

These are from the Wapi Casino?
Yeah. I’ve been at it all night.

02:17.221 --> 02:21.134
I almost missed our girl.
I ain’t used to seein’ her

Almost 7K.

You know what the best part is?

02:41.996 --> 02:43.702
It’s not her account.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.498
Early this morning...

construction workers found What appears
to be a ,oan‘ia/ly intact human skull.

03:02.558 --> 03:05.721
It’s imperative the mayor speak
to the governor as soon as possible.

Consirucf/on workers unearthed
human skeletal remains—

You’re wasting your breath.

We’re dead, Benjamin.

Thanks for the call, Mike.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.737
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Inigo.

Well, the councilman
is thrilled...

04:09.917 --> 04:13.330
that the Service Employees Union
is reconsidering its endorsement.

Don’t pop

Why not? We’re unstoppable.

Nothing beats dead Indians.
Didn’t you see Poltergeist?

feel sorry for Adams right now.

Guess who the guest of honor is.
Darren doesn’t have time
for that.

I thought you said
it wasn’t over.
It isn’t.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.368
No mayor has ever won

from the Record

I don’t think it’s a big deal.

a lot of secrets Rosie
was keeping from her mother.

- I didn’t say that.

I thought you should have it
before it gets out.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.498

only reeks of desperation.

going to help you win.
