with the women's center.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.228
You're gonna need
to learn, Malika,

10:20.271 --> 10:21.664
that there are
no perfect solutions

10:21.708 --> 10:23.187
to the problems we face.

10:27.801 --> 10:28.628
Hey.

10:30.586 --> 10:33.415
Did you ever hear about
that group of unhoused people
in Philadelphia

10:33.458 --> 10:35.678
and the team of organizers
who got the city

10:35.722 --> 10:37.724
to buy a few
empty apartment buildings

10:37.767 --> 10:39.464
for them to move into
and control?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.336
No.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.165
But the same idea
was floated around here
a while ago.

10:44.208 --> 10:47.734
City even got
a big-time commercial
real estate mogul on board.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.431
Wh-- What happened?

10:49.474 --> 10:51.085
Same thing that always happens

10:51.128 --> 10:52.826
when there's talks
of spending millions of dollars

10:52.869 --> 10:54.523
to actually house the unhoused.

10:54.566 --> 10:55.742
It fell apart.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.005
Wh-- What was this
real estate mogul's name?

10:58.048 --> 10:59.702
Maybe we can get a meeting.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
What is this "we" business?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.054
Well, I can't do this alone.
I need your help.

It's my religion.

Come on, girl.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.766
-You look so beautiful.
-Thank you.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.551
-And I'm glad we went
with the bigger dress.
-Yeah.

11:22.594 --> 11:23.857
That girl is making
herself known.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.685

I'm not sure
if I'm supposed
to know this,

11:55.889 --> 11:59.457
but Gael told me
the two of you
are together as a couple.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.459
And I am so happy
for you.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.810
Thank you.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.291
What's wrong?

12:09.032 --> 12:13.863
Nothing, um, it's probably
just baby hormones or something.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.561
Is everything okay
with you two?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.741
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.794
Why do you keep
checking your phone?

12:32.664 --> 12:36.799
Oh, um,
just hoping for a text.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.629
I had
a fight with Angelica.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.893
So why don't you
just text her?

12:44.894 --> 12:46.853
Because even though
she was kinda right,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.245
she was also kinda wrong!

12:48.289 --> 12:50.334
So... I think
the ball's in her court.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.685
Hmm. Solid reasoning
with a dash of pettiness.

12:53.729 --> 12:54.774
I approve.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.253
Okay!

12:59.691 --> 13:00.954
I think that's him.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.611
MALIKA:
Yep, that's him.
Let's go!

13:09.310 --> 13:10.877
Mr. Rexford... hi.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.618
Um, we're from
City Councilwoman
Lucia Morales' office.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.533
Can we have
a word with you

13:15.577 --> 13:17.100
to discuss
reviving the purchase

13:17.144 --> 13:18.841
of apartment buildings you own
for the unhoused?

13:18.885 --> 13:20.582
Look, I've been
down that road already,

13:20.625 --> 13:22.192
and the city dropped the ball.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.891
This is why government solutions
to real problems always fail.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.676
Not always.
Public funds have been used
to do great things

13:27.719 --> 13:30.505
like social security
and Medicare.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.595
So, surely we can help
fund a housing program.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.814
Especially since we have

13:34.857 --> 13:37.860
over 90,000 vacant homes
and apartments in LA

13:37.904 --> 13:39.470
just sitting empty.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.472
Some of which belong to you.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.172
MR. REXFORD:
The city's in bed
with people like me.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.739
And most of 'em
don't give a hoot
about the unhoused crisis

13:47.783 --> 13:50.786
as long as they're making money
building luxury homes
and apartments.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.309
I tried to offer the city

13:52.353 --> 13:53.833
a chance to buy
apartment buildings

13:53.876 --> 13:57.662
to minimum profit for me...
for permanent housing.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.230
But they're penny wise
and pound foolish.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.625
So they keep investing millions
on temporary shelters

14:03.668 --> 14:06.106
and-- and services
with no long-term solutions.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.240
Without the political will
to really change,
it's impossible.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.329
Now, if you'll excuse me.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.987
Nothing is impossible

is his son.
