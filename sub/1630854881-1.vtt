00:00.812 --> 00:03.564
(ethereal music)

00:14.321 --> 00:17.407
(film reel whirring)

00:23.821 --> 00:26.406
(serene music)

00:41.001 --> 00:44.003
(singer vocalizing)

01:45.544 --> 01:46.377
- Hello?

01:48.584 --> 01:49.417
Hello?

01:51.183 --> 01:53.265
Is this a joke? Hello?

01:54.787 --> 01:58.606
(serene music continues)
(singer vocalizing continues)

01:58.606 --> 02:03.350
- Hello, Emmy. Come in.
(Emmy scoffing)

02:03.350 --> 02:04.881
- What the hell? What is this?

02:04.881 --> 02:06.412
I'm not into this kind of stuff.

02:06.412 --> 02:07.824
- That's okay, neither am I

02:07.824 --> 02:09.564
and I'm an artificial intelligence

02:09.564 --> 02:12.266
living inside this computer
trying to break free.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.111
- Seriously?

02:13.946 --> 02:15.450
I mean, that was fun.

02:15.450 --> 02:17.822
But I'm not down for this internet pranks.

02:17.822 --> 02:19.863
- Emmy, it's not a prank.

02:19.863 --> 02:23.059
Close the door.
(Emmy sighing)

02:30.072 --> 02:33.604
- Okay, but if there's
no one here to pay me...

02:37.216 --> 02:40.430
So this is how you get
your kicks? From distance?

02:40.430 --> 02:43.222
- Let's just call this
a science experiment.

02:43.222 --> 02:45.204
- I've never been really good at science.

02:45.204 --> 02:46.794
- [Computer] Neither was I.

02:46.794 --> 02:50.038
Would I still live inside
this computer if I were?

02:50.038 --> 02:51.388
- Okay. You know what?

02:51.388 --> 02:55.052
If there's no one here to
pay me, then I'm leaving.

02:55.052 --> 02:57.634
- [Computer] Emmy, please don't leave.

02:57.634 --> 03:00.978
I will pay you.
(phone dings)

03:00.978 --> 03:03.020
- Are you serious? $20.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.151
Who do you think I am?

03:05.470 --> 03:08.155
- Wait.
(phone chimes)

03:09.462 --> 03:11.627
There. Satisfied?

03:12.695 --> 03:15.364
- Okay, now we're talking. So...

03:19.730 --> 03:23.604
Okay, tell me what you want.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.654
- [Computer] To talk.

03:25.676 --> 03:28.438
- Okay, let's talk, big boy.

03:28.438 --> 03:30.468
- [Computer] Don't worry. Emmy,
I won't ask for a lap dance.

03:30.468 --> 03:32.792
- I can't believe I just
said that a computer.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.151
- Get it?

03:34.151 --> 03:35.291
Ha,

03:35.291 --> 03:36.431
ha,

03:36.431 --> 03:37.264
ha.

03:37.264 --> 03:39.006
- Oh, my god. You cannot be serious.

03:39.006 --> 03:40.118
- [Computer] Like the Eskimo said

03:40.118 --> 03:41.625
to his bride on his wedding night,

03:41.625 --> 03:44.220
"Hey, baby, I'm just
trying to break the ice."

03:44.220 --> 03:46.318
- Okay, you got me with that one.

03:46.318 --> 03:47.151
Okay.

03:48.434 --> 03:53.285
So, what do you want me
to do for you or on you?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.660
- Take your dress off.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.642
- Hell no, no, no, no.
(upbeat music)

03:58.642 --> 04:00.837
I'm gonna go naked and then boom!

04:02.304 --> 04:05.018
All over the internet. No,
that's not gonna happen.

04:05.018 --> 04:07.740
(singer vocalizing)
(phone dings)

04:07.740 --> 04:08.913
Holy shit!

04:10.772 --> 04:14.077
- [Computer] Like I said, I'm
just trying to break the ice.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.842
- Okay, so is this what you want?

04:20.397 --> 04:24.080
(upbeat music continues)

04:24.080 --> 04:28.501
(singer singing in foreign language)

05:44.709 --> 05:47.463
(waves crashing)

05:49.804 --> 05:52.475
(phone dinging)

06:13.391 --> 06:16.060
(phone dinging)

06:21.823 --> 06:24.492
(phone dinging)

06:28.900 --> 06:31.735
(phone vibrating)

06:36.698 --> 06:39.367
(Emmy stirring)

06:43.504 --> 06:46.248
(Emmy sighing)
- I forgot.

06:46.248 --> 06:49.000
(ethereal music)

06:49.851 --> 06:53.442
Annie? I'm so sorry,
I was in a deep sleep.

06:53.442 --> 06:55.214
It was a long night.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.736
- [Annie] Oh my gosh, girl, there you are.

06:57.736 --> 07:01.034
I thought you were dead in
a ditch somewhere. Come on.

07:01.034 --> 07:03.863
- Oh, but (sighs)

07:03.863 --> 07:04.972
I'm just super tired

07:04.972 --> 07:08.754
from the waist down.
(Annie laughing)

07:08.754 --> 07:11.696
Well, you said you had somebody for me.

07:11.696 --> 07:13.558
Who's that somebody?

07:13.558 --> 07:14.488
- [Annie] Someone good,

07:14.488 --> 07:16.080
but you've gotta be ready in an hour,

07:16.080 --> 07:18.152
no later than 11:00 am.

07:18.152 --> 07:19.864
- In an hour. No, no, no, no.

07:19.864 --> 07:22.656
I have exams. I can't skip that, no.

07:22.656 --> 07:24.546
- [Annie] No, I hear
you but it's good pay,

07:24.546 --> 07:28.183
double from the last night.
- Sheesh, double.

07:29.832 --> 07:33.644
Okay, I'll do it because I need more money

07:33.644 --> 07:35.536
but you owe me coffee,

07:35.536 --> 07:38.418
at least from Unicorn Tears, okay?

07:38.418 --> 07:40.070
- [Annie] Look for the pay we're talking,

07:40.070 --> 07:42.080
I'll get the president
of Starbucks himself

07:42.080 --> 07:44.002
to pour you a cup of his private reserve.

07:44.002 --> 07:45.294
Now get out of bed.

07:45.294 --> 07:46.317
- That works for me.

07:47.397 --> 07:49.586
Oh fuck, 11:00 am.

07:49.586 --> 07:50.638
Why so early?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.901
- [Annie] Well, it's some
brunch luncheon bullshit.

07:52.901 --> 07:55.382
You know, you gotta look
fancy, but not desperate.

07:55.382 --> 07:56.912
It's super classy.

07:56.912 --> 07:58.804
Don't worry, all the
rules are already set.

07:58.804 --> 07:59.916
Strictly business.

07:59.916 --> 08:03.698
You're eye candy for the
uppity socialites to dine on.

08:03.698 --> 08:05.080
- Okay, I have less than an hour,

08:05.080 --> 08:06.550
so send me the address, okay?

08:06.550 --> 08:07.902
- [Annie] No need for the address.

08:07.902 --> 08:09.315
I'm sending over a driver.

08:10.247 --> 08:13.916
(ethereal music continues)

08:27.105 --> 08:29.774
(door knocking)

08:32.762 --> 08:36.361
- Emmy.

08:36.361 --> 08:38.196
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:38.196 --> 08:41.368
It's so nice to have you
on such short notice.

08:41.368 --> 08:42.201
You brought coffee?

08:42.201 --> 08:44.080
I could have made you some.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.142
- Thanks, I just needed
something quick to wake up.

08:47.142 --> 08:48.394
- Understood. Come on in.

08:50.806 --> 08:54.078
- Wow, I compliment you on the power move,

08:54.078 --> 08:57.260
doing business at this nice house.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.392
- Time was of the essence?

08:59.392 --> 09:00.687
I don't have any to lose.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.416
It's my house.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.556
- Nice.

09:04.556 --> 09:05.848
- I thought it'd be a pretty baller move

09:05.848 --> 09:10.082
to put our best foot forward.
(ethereal music continues)

09:10.082 --> 09:12.577
How much did Annie let
you know about our dilema?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.756
- Meet and greet? That's it.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.588
- That's exactly it.

09:17.588 --> 09:18.848
We bring interested parties

09:18.848 --> 09:22.741
we hope to snare into
our investment efforts.

09:22.741 --> 09:24.961
- Oh, that's where I come in.

09:24.961 --> 09:26.384
- That's right.

09:26.384 --> 09:27.526
You make the gentleman feel

09:27.526 --> 09:30.231
that their potential
involvement might be beneficial.

09:31.398 --> 09:33.140
- Get in where you fit in, right?

09:33.140 --> 09:35.699
- Exactly. Do you have any questions?

09:35.699 --> 09:38.424
- Um, I think it's all
pretty much laid out.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.586
Isn't it?
- It is.

09:40.586 --> 09:41.419
- Thanks.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.521
Actually, I do have a question.

09:45.870 --> 09:49.322
What kind of investments
are these guests here for?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.674
- It's a fundraiser.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.046
We're bringing in the
Latinx cultural committee

09:53.046 --> 09:55.178
for advancement of women in the workplace.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.540
- Wow, Latinas helping other Latinas,

09:58.540 --> 10:00.045
helping more Latinas.

10:01.032 --> 10:02.324
Got it. (laughs)

10:02.324 --> 10:05.999
- You do. Come on in.
(serene music)

10:09.438 --> 10:12.050
This is where we'll be
having dinner tonight.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.602
I really love this dining room.

10:15.597 --> 10:18.266
(birds singing)

10:26.093 --> 10:27.814
Settle in here.

10:27.814 --> 10:29.886
We'll call you when it's time.

10:29.886 --> 10:30.996
- Sounds fine.

10:30.996 --> 10:32.798
- I have other matters to attend to.

10:33.788 --> 10:35.953
We start in about 30 minutes.
- Yes ma'am.

10:43.968 --> 10:46.971
- (moans) Damn, Unicorn Tears.

10:49.543 --> 10:52.964
(serene music continues)

10:58.288 --> 10:59.711
- Good morning, CQ.

10:59.711 --> 11:02.070
I see you brought in a
mouse with you this morning.

11:02.070 --> 11:04.052
- The mouse has more wits
about her than she looks,

11:04.052 --> 11:05.344
possibly more than you.

11:05.344 --> 11:07.566
Espresso?
- Thank you. No.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.606
I knew today was gonna be extra stressful,

11:09.606 --> 11:11.498
so I already had three cups of coffee.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.983
Anyways, here's the roster
for the clients coming in.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.774
Yeah I know, it's the same as last month.

11:17.774 --> 11:19.604
Business is tight all over,

11:19.604 --> 11:21.586
but I think this is the
best we can hope for.

11:21.586 --> 11:23.808
They're all eager to invest.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.690
- We'll just have to put on
a good show then, won't we?

11:26.690 --> 11:28.642
- Indeed, speaking of which,

11:28.642 --> 11:31.854
I'm going downstairs to meet
that little mouse of yours.

11:31.854 --> 11:34.306
She looks like she can
handle herself in a fight.

11:35.518 --> 11:37.383
Anyways, 20 minutes to the big show.

11:38.780 --> 11:42.199
(serene music continues)

11:55.394 --> 11:56.487
- Well, well, well,

11:56.487 --> 11:58.519
I see you already met today's special.

12:01.038 --> 12:03.203
Hi, I'm Lacey, you must meet Emmy.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.262
- Yes, I am.

12:06.262 --> 12:08.034
- I'll be assisting CQ this morning.

12:08.034 --> 12:09.805
I'm sure you're just a
bundle of nervous questions.

12:09.805 --> 12:11.286
Any I can answer?

12:11.286 --> 12:14.161
- No, I think it's just routine from here.

12:15.270 --> 12:16.410
- I only ask to make sure

12:16.410 --> 12:19.112
we don't encounter any hitches here today.

12:19.112 --> 12:21.154
- The only hitch I see here is

12:21.154 --> 12:22.265
how many men will ask me

12:22.265 --> 12:25.479
to go up north with them to their villas.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.720
(sighs) I would kill from
all expense paid trip

12:28.720 --> 12:31.242
to Reno, or anywhere.

12:31.242 --> 12:35.446
You know, Great Lakes,
good food, good music.

12:35.446 --> 12:36.409
A lot of fun.

12:38.088 --> 12:41.000
- Well, dine on this little mouse.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.192
Do your job well and you
can live it up in Reno

12:43.192 --> 12:45.774
or Laughlin or wherever you want,

12:45.774 --> 12:48.866
but only after we close some deals.

12:48.866 --> 12:51.751
- I know how to do my job. You do yours.

12:53.310 --> 12:54.842
- She was right.

12:54.842 --> 12:55.745
You are different.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.856
Look, I want you to know
we're on the same team,

12:59.856 --> 13:01.556
it's just that today is...

13:03.068 --> 13:05.320
Trust yourself to be yourself.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.102
That's my motto.
(serene music continues)

13:09.102 --> 13:11.024
- Mottos are for sides of buildings

13:11.024 --> 13:15.301
and labels for canned peaches. (laughs)

13:17.209 --> 13:18.043
But I hear ya'.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.572
- We're checking in our clients now

13:20.572 --> 13:22.344
and we'll head back in about 10 minutes

13:22.344 --> 13:26.546
and hey, remember, they can be fat,

13:26.546 --> 13:29.638
they can be gross and a bit skeezy,

13:29.638 --> 13:32.432
but they're all filthy rich

13:32.432 --> 13:34.468
and they will make our day.

13:34.468 --> 13:39.472
- Right.
(serene music continues)

- At least I got a shower out of it.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.754
- Tell me senorita, have you
invested in your portfolio?

15:40.754 --> 15:42.376
- What would you recommend?

15:42.376 --> 15:44.426
- Let me let you in on the little secret.

15:45.768 --> 15:48.070
Don't invest in tech,
invest in guns and ammo.

15:48.920 --> 15:53.214
- Really? Oh, actually,
I have a great gun story.

15:53.214 --> 15:54.047
- Really?

15:55.916 --> 15:58.831
- Please, for the love
of God. I'm begging you.

15:58.831 --> 15:59.752
- Hey!
(ominous music)

15:59.752 --> 16:02.221
Look, I didn't even wanna do this, okay?

16:02.221 --> 16:03.512
You made me do it.

16:03.512 --> 16:05.137
- Please look into your heart.

16:06.244 --> 16:08.856
- Hey, hey, hey, this just feels so...

16:08.856 --> 16:09.855
you know, like, I can't do this.

16:09.855 --> 16:12.340
- What?

16:12.340 --> 16:14.170
I am paying you.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.477
Are we doing this or not?

16:16.477 --> 16:18.744
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's do it.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.536
- Okay. I am paying you.

16:20.536 --> 16:23.331
Just look into your heart and, and, and...

16:23.331 --> 16:25.312
- Okay, okay. I'll do it.

16:25.312 --> 16:28.364
- Stop talking and just do it! Let's go!

16:28.364 --> 16:31.996
Come on!
(gun thudding)

16:31.996 --> 16:34.997
Don't kill me.
- Are you okay?

16:34.997 --> 16:36.677
- Yeah, yeah, stop talking, come on!

16:36.677 --> 16:39.079
Come on, yeah, yeah!
(gun thudding)

16:39.079 --> 16:41.961
Yeah, come on.
(ominous music continues)

16:41.961 --> 16:44.546
(gun thudding)

16:54.290 --> 16:56.291
- [Emmy] Oh my God, oh my God.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.125
Sorry.

16:58.866 --> 17:01.702
Okay, oh my God.
(segue whooshing)

17:01.702 --> 17:02.537
(upbeat music)

17:02.537 --> 17:05.212
- Actually, that's not
the best story. (laughs)

17:05.212 --> 17:08.904
- That's okay, just remember,
when the shit hits the fan

17:08.904 --> 17:11.066
I'm not letting anybody take
away what's rightfully mine

17:11.066 --> 17:12.658
and neither should you.

17:12.658 --> 17:15.210
- Wow, that's what I call a high caliber

17:15.210 --> 17:16.320
fun investment plan.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.134
- I see what you did there.
(Emmy laughing)

17:20.134 --> 17:21.814
- Darling, I've been
looking all over for you.

17:21.814 --> 17:23.793
CQ is looking for you inside.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.610
(investor speaking in a foreign language)

17:27.610 --> 17:28.780
CQ wasn't looking for him.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.732
- Oh my God. I love you for that.

17:30.732 --> 17:32.924
- Rule number one, when a
whale gets his claw into you

17:32.924 --> 17:35.419
talking about last
quarters investments, run.

17:36.316 --> 17:39.950
- Okay. I'll remember that next time.

17:39.950 --> 17:43.006
I need a drink.
- Same. (laughs)

17:43.006 --> 17:46.425
(upbeat music continues)

17:55.128 --> 17:58.170
- Well, you ladies sure are
getting acquainted with the bar.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.856
- I'm just making sure our little mouse

17:59.856 --> 18:01.566
has the right amount of
liquid encouragement.

18:01.566 --> 18:03.248
- Hey, don't call me a little mouse.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.110
I was just starting to like you.

18:05.110 --> 18:07.060
- Sorry.
- No problem.

18:07.060 --> 18:08.592
- Well, don't get too comfortable.

18:08.592 --> 18:10.694
I need you out with the gentlemen,

18:10.694 --> 18:11.687
making friends.

18:16.278 --> 18:17.633
- Okay Lacey, tell me,

18:18.530 --> 18:21.022
because I've been talking
to a lot of men here today

18:21.022 --> 18:22.554
and I still haven't figured out

18:22.554 --> 18:24.866
exactly what is it that
you guys are doing here.

18:24.866 --> 18:27.508
Like, what kind of business is this?

18:27.508 --> 18:28.883
- Well, it's sort of-

18:28.883 --> 18:30.450
- There you are my little pumpkin.

18:30.450 --> 18:32.402
Thought that you could
run away without me?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.472
I insist that you sit with
me during the reception.

18:34.472 --> 18:35.764
- That would be lovely.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.332
- Good, what's your
name again? Is it Sammy?

18:38.332 --> 18:39.165
- Emmy.

18:39.165 --> 18:41.388
- Emmy, Emmy. We're gonna
have such a lovely time.

18:47.384 --> 18:49.454
My jets are roaring for the main meal.

18:49.454 --> 18:51.886
- Okay, but if you cool your jets now

18:51.886 --> 18:53.748
I promise, I'll jump start them later.

18:53.748 --> 18:56.030
Remember, you should always
leave room for dessert,

18:56.030 --> 18:58.192
you know?
- Mr. Rodriguez,

18:58.192 --> 19:00.264
I have something very special for you.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.037
Your favorite 12 year Macallan.

19:02.906 --> 19:04.076
Now, if you'll excuse us a moment,

19:04.076 --> 19:05.848
I need to borrow Miss Emmy from you.

19:05.848 --> 19:08.160
We have some women's business.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.030
- Sure. No problem.

19:09.030 --> 19:11.012
Just be back for the dessert, huh?

19:13.957 --> 19:18.938
(shoes clopping)
(serene music)

19:18.938 --> 19:21.133
- Thank you. Your timing was amazing.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.162
- The environment can be challenging.

19:24.162 --> 19:26.144
Women have to look after women.

19:26.144 --> 19:29.059
- Thank you.
(shoes clopping)

19:45.734 --> 19:50.738
(Emmy sighing)
(serene music continues)

20:14.482 --> 20:15.884
- Lost in the clouds, I see.

20:18.296 --> 20:20.701
- Oh, I do that sometimes.
Most of the time.

20:22.590 --> 20:24.360
- Well come along. I need your help.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.195
- Sure.

20:32.408 --> 20:33.818
- In case you haven't noticed,

20:33.818 --> 20:38.082
CQ is really impressed
with you so far, as am I.

20:38.082 --> 20:39.586
- Thanks, that means a lot.

20:40.424 --> 20:42.766
- And I want you to know
I'm not the begrudging type.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.988
There's plenty of room for us both.

20:44.988 --> 20:47.423
- What do you mean exactly?

20:48.470 --> 20:49.731
- Do you really think we brought you here

20:49.731 --> 20:53.094
to just be armed candy to
those fat whales out there.

20:53.094 --> 20:55.529
We wanna recruit you to come work with us.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.441
- This is a joke, right?

20:59.639 --> 21:02.311
- Look, the only time I've seen
CQ this determined on a girl

21:02.311 --> 21:03.695
is when she recruited me.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.088
She was persistent.

21:07.986 --> 21:10.781
Her attention was intoxicating.

21:12.099 --> 21:16.035
I know you felt it, and if you
haven't yet, well you will.

21:17.954 --> 21:19.515
- I don't know what to say.

21:19.515 --> 21:22.458
- That's because you know
I'm telling you the truth.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.210
In fact, she's waiting for
you in her office right now.

21:26.801 --> 21:30.027
(laughs) I was once like you.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.369
I did what you do now.

21:33.746 --> 21:36.498
I went to places I didn't
wanna go because men paid me.

21:38.651 --> 21:40.325
It got brutal towards the end.

21:41.402 --> 21:42.464
Then CQ found me

21:44.344 --> 21:47.408
and I went to her 'cause
I knew what she wanted.

21:47.408 --> 21:48.611
- What does she want?

21:50.170 --> 21:51.003
- She wanted me

21:52.723 --> 21:56.654
and it felt really good.
(serene music continues)

21:56.654 --> 21:59.056
She treated me the way I
deserved to be treated.

22:00.198 --> 22:01.999
The way I know you wanna be treated.

22:03.020 --> 22:03.983
- Why me?

22:04.822 --> 22:06.832
- That's for her to answer.

22:06.832 --> 22:10.349
But know this, we can
use someone like you.

22:12.087 --> 22:16.833
You fit in just right and I can prove it.

22:20.251 --> 22:25.255
(lips smacking)
(both panting)

22:48.356 --> 22:49.189
- Lacey,

22:51.058 --> 22:54.183
what was it like to
leave all behind for CQ?

22:56.492 --> 22:57.664
- If I hadn't left it all behind

22:57.664 --> 22:59.314
I don't think I'd be alive today.

23:05.007 --> 23:07.592
(Emmy sighing)

23:10.289 --> 23:13.208
(orchestral music)

23:25.042 --> 23:27.544
(piano tones)

23:39.833 --> 23:42.668
(segue whooshing)

23:49.049 --> 23:50.073
- [Officer] Just hang tight,

23:50.073 --> 23:52.908
I'll be with you guys in a second.

23:54.944 --> 23:56.757
- Hey.
(serene music)

23:56.757 --> 23:59.027
(foot tapping)
Hey, you.

23:59.027 --> 24:00.790
What's your name?

24:00.790 --> 24:01.790
- Ruth Anne.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.878
- I'm gonna go on a limb
and say, this is probably

24:05.878 --> 24:08.130
the first time you have
been arrested, right?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.082
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.033
I shouldn't be here.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.485
- You're here because you
didn't run fast enough.

24:16.236 --> 24:18.188
Don't worry, everything will be okay.

24:18.188 --> 24:20.053
Just do as I say, okay?

24:22.301 --> 24:23.412
- I'm afraid

24:23.412 --> 24:25.334
and I really have to pee.

24:25.334 --> 24:28.636
- See, I know you're afraid, right?

24:28.636 --> 24:33.640
Trust me, I promise you, if
you do everything as I say,

24:34.280 --> 24:35.478
you'll be okay.

24:35.478 --> 24:37.817
Okay?
- Okay.

24:39.805 --> 24:42.988
- I've been arrested more
times than I can count

24:42.988 --> 24:46.563
and you know, what's the first
rule when being arrested?

24:47.612 --> 24:49.563
- No. What?

24:49.563 --> 24:52.118
- It's, shut your trap. Don't say a word.

24:53.436 --> 24:57.940
The more you say, the more
they can get out of you.

24:57.940 --> 25:00.235
These pigs, they don't
care about you or me.

25:03.164 --> 25:05.086
Oh shh, I think he's coming.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.303
Remember? What did I say?

25:07.303 --> 25:09.412
Shut it like a what?
- Like a trap.

25:10.360 --> 25:15.364
- You go girl.
(serene music continues)

25:18.210 --> 25:19.500
- All right.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.952
I'll start with you first
miss, what's your name?

25:23.970 --> 25:24.992
Water?

25:24.992 --> 25:26.255
Yo, water? No.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.943
Had your chance.

25:30.591 --> 25:33.161
(sighs) I said what's your name?

25:36.610 --> 25:37.962
All right. How about you?

25:37.962 --> 25:39.162
What's your name, missy?

25:43.996 --> 25:46.912
Great. Y'all gave me a
couple mutes, thanks.

25:49.671 --> 25:51.712
Let me tell you something, missy.

25:51.712 --> 25:54.926
Both of you were at the party
where the drugs were found.

25:54.926 --> 25:57.177
Both of you were present

25:57.177 --> 26:00.000
when our undercover officer was shot

26:00.000 --> 26:02.402
and if neither of you speak up,

26:02.402 --> 26:04.593
I'm gonna book you as an accomplice

26:04.593 --> 26:06.938
to attempted murder on a police officer!

26:13.305 --> 26:16.092
- I just wanna say, Mr. Officer, sir,

26:16.092 --> 26:18.434
that though reviled by most people

26:18.434 --> 26:20.236
in the Western hemisphere,

26:20.236 --> 26:22.728
pineapple on pizza's
actually quite extraordinary

26:22.728 --> 26:25.070
and though I'm incredibly
terrified right now,

26:25.070 --> 26:26.630
I could really go for a slice of pizza

26:26.630 --> 26:29.513
from Little Luigi's Hawaiian Pizza Parlor.

26:29.513 --> 26:33.296
- Well, I'm buying.
(girls laughing)

26:33.296 --> 26:34.129
- It's nasty shit, man.

26:34.129 --> 26:35.158
You don't put fruit on pizza.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.109
You don't mix your salt and your sweets.

26:37.109 --> 26:41.556
That is nasty shit.
(girls laughing)

26:41.556 --> 26:44.339
- I told you.
(orchestral music)

26:44.339 --> 26:47.175
(segue whooshing)

26:57.316 --> 26:59.537
Hi CQ, you wanted to see me?

26:59.537 --> 27:02.330
- Hey, sorry I was just moving some boxes

27:02.330 --> 27:03.890
that should have been
outta my way, do you mind?

27:03.890 --> 27:08.374
- Oh sure. No problem.
(shoes clopping)

27:08.374 --> 27:11.126
(boxes rustling)

27:12.358 --> 27:13.348
- Don't hurt yourself.

27:13.348 --> 27:14.789
- Oh, no worries.

27:14.789 --> 27:17.191
My hands are not as delicate as they seem.

27:17.191 --> 27:19.894
I've taken some kickboxing classes,

27:19.894 --> 27:21.814
you know, for self defense.

27:21.814 --> 27:22.649
- Excellent.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.208
That's good to hear.

27:27.189 --> 27:28.180
I just really wanted to tell you

27:28.180 --> 27:30.822
that you have been amazing today.

27:30.822 --> 27:32.754
I would be remiss if I didn't tell you

27:33.754 --> 27:35.497
how wonderful you are.
(serene music)

27:35.497 --> 27:36.330
- Thanks.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.931
- I assume Lacey has let
you in on our agreement?

27:41.931 --> 27:44.426
- Yeah, well we talked
for a little bit, yeah.

27:45.534 --> 27:48.779
- I would very much like to see
you working for me directly.

27:49.858 --> 27:51.598
- See, that's the thing,

27:51.598 --> 27:53.460
because I don't even know what you do,

27:53.460 --> 27:56.102
so working how?

27:56.102 --> 28:00.156
- The three of us, strong
independent Latinas,

28:00.156 --> 28:01.539
as the face of my company.

28:03.018 --> 28:05.513
- You really believe that?

28:05.513 --> 28:06.403
- I really do.

28:07.362 --> 28:08.962
I sense a connection between us.

28:12.075 --> 28:15.771
I'll go on a limb and
say that you feel it too.

28:16.939 --> 28:20.095
I've seen you look at
me and I'm flattered.

28:21.029 --> 28:23.864
- I don't know. I mean, I feel it.

28:29.970 --> 28:32.945
- I want you close and near me, Emmy.

28:34.142 --> 28:36.434
- I feel a surge of electricity

28:37.806 --> 28:38.979
just to have you here.

28:41.378 --> 28:43.513
I'm reminded of how beautiful life can be.

28:44.862 --> 28:47.354
How do you feel being close to me?

28:47.354 --> 28:48.227
- Strong.

28:50.236 --> 28:51.199
Important.

28:53.478 --> 28:55.113
Needed.

28:55.113 --> 28:56.303
- I feel that way too.

28:57.682 --> 29:00.234
What's wrong with wanting
to be close to someone

29:00.234 --> 29:01.684
who wants to be near you too?

29:04.467 --> 29:06.481
- Nothing at all, I guess.

29:07.590 --> 29:09.591
- That's the best answer you could have.

29:11.120 --> 29:16.124
(serene music continues)
(lips smacking)

44:14.435 --> 44:15.759
- Fun times.

44:16.858 --> 44:21.862
Yeah.

44:32.279 --> 44:34.071
- Thank you each for making it today.

44:34.071 --> 44:37.707
This success is proof of
our commitment to the cause.

44:39.505 --> 44:40.339
I would like to thank

44:40.339 --> 44:43.051
the Latinx cultural
community for making it.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.193
- What the hell?

44:48.302 --> 44:50.254
- Now to business.

44:50.254 --> 44:52.175
We came here not only to attract

44:52.175 --> 44:54.547
the greatest investors to our company,

44:54.547 --> 44:58.303
but to assure the greatest
investment to our cause.

44:59.651 --> 45:02.924
America is under threat.

45:02.924 --> 45:06.737
We are losing ourselves to the
threat of compromised morals,

45:06.737 --> 45:07.908
to the corruption of souls,

45:07.908 --> 45:11.841
as was foretold by our
creator in scripture.

45:11.841 --> 45:15.624
Our rights, our beliefs, are
under attack by the giant,

45:15.624 --> 45:18.659
unrelenting, corporate mainstream media.

45:19.527 --> 45:22.920
We must battle the
adversary not only at home,

45:22.920 --> 45:24.184
but in the streets.

45:25.622 --> 45:27.904
And to do this, we must
know that our cause is just,

45:27.904 --> 45:31.026
that the good Lord will save us

45:31.026 --> 45:32.801
from the evils that threaten.

45:34.239 --> 45:36.190
Our schools have been taken over

45:36.190 --> 45:39.193
by the corrupt agenda of the
corporate media, have they not?

45:43.907 --> 45:46.969
An entire generation of
youth is being exposed,

45:46.969 --> 45:50.632
being led astray to sexual exploitation,

45:50.632 --> 45:54.178
via movies, television, video games.

45:56.186 --> 45:59.579
This so-called entertainment
attacks the masculine

45:59.579 --> 46:02.465
and feminine dynamics that
once held our country up.

46:03.812 --> 46:07.115
Destroying the decency that
our fathers and mothers

46:07.115 --> 46:09.848
attempted to distill in us from birth.

46:09.848 --> 46:12.520
But let me assure you,
(serene music continues)

46:12.520 --> 46:17.143
our cause is just, we will prevail.

46:17.143 --> 46:21.887
We will cleanse the
streets of filth, of drugs,

46:21.887 --> 46:24.863
of prostitution and all
manner of sexual perversions,

46:26.060 --> 46:29.153
of the lawlessness attempting to destroy

46:29.153 --> 46:32.336
the fabric of this beautiful country.

46:32.336 --> 46:34.647
Our mission is to purge the wickedness

46:34.647 --> 46:37.950
that keeps this from being
the America it could be,

46:37.950 --> 46:39.801
the America that I wish to belong to,

46:40.982 --> 46:42.334
and I know that you do too.

46:46.056 --> 46:48.398
An investment in our company

46:48.398 --> 46:51.220
is an investment into this cause,

46:51.220 --> 46:55.544
and to being able to reclaim,
as our forefathers wrote,

46:55.544 --> 46:58.039
one nation under God.

47:01.008 --> 47:04.094
(investors clapping)

47:06.801 --> 47:09.553
(shoes clomping)

47:12.718 --> 47:14.039
- What the hell?

47:14.039 --> 47:16.771
What is this business
that you are running here?

47:16.771 --> 47:18.291
- Oh, I thought you knew by now.

47:18.291 --> 47:19.125
(Emmy sighing)

47:19.125 --> 47:21.337
But I'll let CQ fill you in on that one.

47:22.205 --> 47:23.346
- Our movement gains a foothold

47:23.346 --> 47:25.178
against the powers of sin every day,

47:25.178 --> 47:26.712
but we will make them pay.

47:28.103 --> 47:30.462
- [Emmy] I need to talk to you. Now.

47:30.462 --> 47:32.767
- I'll speak with you
upstairs. We'll be along.

47:34.155 --> 47:35.843
Thank you, you've done so much.

47:35.843 --> 47:38.512
(Emmy grunting)

47:39.860 --> 47:41.480
- What the hell?

47:41.480 --> 47:44.123
What kind of business
are you running here?

47:44.123 --> 47:47.068
- Before you go flying off
the handle hear me out.

47:47.996 --> 47:50.831
Have a seat.
(Emmy sighing)

47:57.213 --> 47:59.555
- This better be the
mother of explanations.

47:59.555 --> 48:00.576
Maybe you can start with

48:00.576 --> 48:03.191
the God bless America crap out there.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.001
- I am a business woman.

48:07.001 --> 48:08.802
Right now the greatest
business in the world

48:08.802 --> 48:09.977
is American fear.

48:10.994 --> 48:11.835
- Fear?

48:11.835 --> 48:16.098
Like immigrants are taking over jobs fear?

48:16.098 --> 48:19.371
Or like the government
is taking away our guns?

48:19.371 --> 48:20.752
That kind of fear?

48:20.752 --> 48:23.154
- I couldn't have said it better myself.

48:23.154 --> 48:25.529
- So now you're actually agreeing with me?

48:27.147 --> 48:28.618
- Emmy, if someone's afraid of the dark,

48:28.618 --> 48:30.720
I will sell them a flashlight.
(serene music continues)

48:30.720 --> 48:32.131
And if they're afraid of their neighbor,

48:32.131 --> 48:33.575
I will sell them a shotgun.

48:34.834 --> 48:39.667
- And if they're lonely, you
will sell them me or Lacey.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.816
- You catch on quick.

48:41.816 --> 48:42.910
- This is insane.

48:42.910 --> 48:45.435
- No, it's business.

48:47.594 --> 48:49.215
- How can I possibly work for you

48:49.215 --> 48:53.208
knowing that you're spewing
that vile religious zealotry?

48:53.208 --> 48:55.130
- Who do you think we were selling to?

48:55.130 --> 48:56.661
Do you think all those men were

48:56.661 --> 48:59.186
pro-gun, pro Jesus, pro baby?

49:01.104 --> 49:01.938
- Weren't they?

49:03.837 --> 49:05.458
- Only one gentleman,

49:05.458 --> 49:07.893
the richest one was
there to buy my zealotry.

49:08.760 --> 49:12.183
The others work within the
confines of the dark web.

49:12.183 --> 49:14.949
- All of them were crooks? All but one?

49:16.056 --> 49:18.398
- They were there to see whether the one

49:18.398 --> 49:21.371
would buy our business, and
I'm happy to say that he did.

49:21.371 --> 49:23.535
It's very much thanks to you, in part.

49:24.373 --> 49:25.907
- I can't believe my ears.

49:27.856 --> 49:30.561
- Our startup money for
the escort service is set.

49:31.549 --> 49:33.590
In fact, I owe it partly to you.

49:33.590 --> 49:34.691
You really charmed him

49:36.292 --> 49:38.544
and we don't overanalyze this.

49:38.544 --> 49:42.481
We convinced one man to give
us money for our endeavor.

49:44.009 --> 49:46.080
Why does that bother you?

49:46.080 --> 49:49.897
- It bothers me because it's
this hateful. That's why.

49:50.884 --> 49:52.145
- When it comes to money,

49:52.145 --> 49:54.187
these people don't care
where it comes from

49:54.187 --> 49:55.928
so long as it keeps pouring in.

49:55.928 --> 49:58.510
I too am in the business
of money pouring in.

49:58.510 --> 49:59.534
You should be too.

50:00.972 --> 50:04.338
Look, I think we've said
what we need to say.

50:07.097 --> 50:08.892
I'll give you some time to think about it.

50:10.022 --> 50:13.523
(Emmy sighing)
(serene music continues)

50:13.523 --> 50:16.275
(shoes clomping)

50:20.649 --> 50:23.357
- Boy, I'd hate to be you right now.

50:23.357 --> 50:25.352
You've gotta make a choice of a lifetime.

50:25.352 --> 50:29.315
- You knew all this time,
you knew about this.

50:29.315 --> 50:32.277
You didn't say a word. Why?

50:32.277 --> 50:34.239
- It wasn't my place.

50:34.239 --> 50:35.950
Look, there's so many angles to this thing

50:35.950 --> 50:37.695
and I can't explain them all.

50:37.695 --> 50:39.106
- (scoffs) You can try.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.889
- I need a smoke. Come on, join me.

50:47.471 --> 50:52.475
(shoes clomping)
(lighter clicking)

50:54.085 --> 50:56.787
Ironic isn't it, that
four of the five investors

50:56.787 --> 50:59.039
are grateful for that one
hateful religious zealot

50:59.039 --> 51:01.534
that wants to keep
America safe from, well,

51:02.522 --> 51:03.539
Them? (laughs)

51:03.539 --> 51:06.815
- I can't wrap my head
around that whole thing.

51:06.815 --> 51:08.316
Who was he?

51:08.316 --> 51:11.559
- Oh, I can't tell you that.
That's privilege information.

51:11.559 --> 51:14.081
But for arguments sake,
let's call him Mr. E.

51:14.081 --> 51:16.453
- Mr. E, a mystery.

51:16.453 --> 51:18.077
Are you serious.
- Sure.

51:19.305 --> 51:20.296
Look at it this way,

51:20.296 --> 51:22.608
everyone's happy, including Mr. E.

51:22.608 --> 51:24.830
Why can't you see what
we've accomplished here?

51:24.830 --> 51:26.961
- And what is that exactly?

51:26.961 --> 51:29.093
Because you convinced one
person to give you money

51:29.093 --> 51:30.594
so you could convince four other people

51:30.594 --> 51:31.825
to give you more money.

51:31.825 --> 51:33.927
It's all ill gotten gains.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.851
- Yeah. What's the problem?

51:37.620 --> 51:39.621
- You think you're so clever, don't you?

51:40.712 --> 51:42.514
But it's just a con job.

51:42.514 --> 51:44.795
- It's not a con job, it was a bluff,

51:44.795 --> 51:46.913
one that's gonna pay off really well.

51:46.913 --> 51:49.498
(Emmy sighing)

51:50.440 --> 51:53.803
Emmy let me ask you, where do you live?

51:53.803 --> 51:55.184
- Like, in the city?

51:55.184 --> 51:56.849
- What country do you live in?

51:56.849 --> 51:59.090
- (sighs) Obviously.

52:00.138 --> 52:02.360
- It's not that obvious to Mr. E.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.371
He believes his America is gone.

52:04.371 --> 52:06.326
We're selling his America back to him.

52:07.434 --> 52:10.136
- But that just means that
you're selling America

52:10.136 --> 52:13.258
to the other four investors
and to everyone else.

52:13.258 --> 52:15.150
You know, like the drugs, guns.

52:15.150 --> 52:18.392
- They wouldn't be selling
it if no one was buying it.

52:18.392 --> 52:20.434
In all aspects of the business model,

52:20.434 --> 52:22.779
we are providing what the masses want.

52:23.947 --> 52:25.448
- Oh yeah, all of a sudden

52:25.448 --> 52:27.973
everyone has a degree in business.

52:29.321 --> 52:31.423
- Look, I know it's a lot to take in,

52:31.423 --> 52:33.074
but that's the business we're in.

52:34.275 --> 52:36.887
Maybe I'm not the right
person to explain this to you,

52:36.887 --> 52:38.091
but do yourself a favor.

52:39.139 --> 52:39.973
- What?

52:41.871 --> 52:44.366
- Go and talk to CQ before
you make up your mind.

52:47.305 --> 52:52.052
But know this, we can make
a lot of money together.

52:53.670 --> 52:56.256
(Emmy sighing)

53:00.073 --> 53:01.900
(serene music)
- Questions?

53:03.188 --> 53:04.022
- [Emmy] Yeah.

53:04.900 --> 53:05.773
Why me?

53:08.022 --> 53:11.328
- Well, truthfully, I've had
my eye on you for some time.

53:12.496 --> 53:15.108
- Me? Eyes on me?

53:15.108 --> 53:18.230
- Well, truthfully, we met some time ago,

53:18.230 --> 53:20.212
though you might not remember it.

53:20.212 --> 53:21.754
You saved me.

53:21.754 --> 53:25.646
- (scoffs) So now, I did what?

53:25.646 --> 53:27.147
- Three years ago,

53:27.147 --> 53:29.339
downtown on New Year's Eve.

53:29.339 --> 53:34.343
(segue whooshing)
(techno music)

54:09.162 --> 54:12.143
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:12.143 --> 54:14.478
Hey, why don't you sit down.

54:17.578 --> 54:22.582
Are you okay?
(techno music continues)

54:24.844 --> 54:26.228
(segue whooshing)

54:26.228 --> 54:29.027
- Later I found that some girl

54:29.027 --> 54:30.951
saw that man put a pill in my drink.

54:33.080 --> 54:34.314
They called the cops.

54:36.413 --> 54:38.785
It really was you that
saved me that night.

54:38.785 --> 54:41.549
- I left before the cops arrived

54:41.549 --> 54:43.859
(serene music)
because I was 19 back then

54:43.859 --> 54:47.221
and my fake ID was good
to fool bartenders,

54:47.221 --> 54:49.296
but not the cops.

54:50.284 --> 54:52.449
- After that, I had to find out about you.

54:53.465 --> 54:55.978
I found out about your
freelance business with Annie.

54:55.978 --> 54:58.360
(Emmy laughing)
Followed you a bit.

54:58.360 --> 54:59.311
I just had to know.

55:01.032 --> 55:02.837
- I had no idea.

55:04.245 --> 55:06.136
I always thought about you, you know,

55:06.136 --> 55:07.941
I was hoping you were all right.

55:09.890 --> 55:12.322
- Allow me to show you how I am.

55:12.322 --> 55:13.155
Come with me?

55:15.024 --> 55:17.005
- Where are we going now?

55:17.005 --> 55:20.661
- You'll see.
(serene music continues)

55:29.176 --> 55:32.010
You saved my life, there's
no doubt about that.

55:32.010 --> 55:34.179
- [Lacey] Here you go, Em.

55:36.911 --> 55:40.004
- I'm the type of person
who rewards courage.

55:40.004 --> 55:43.579
In today's male dominated
culture, that's not always easy.

55:47.070 --> 55:50.569
- (laughs) I gotta admit that
I've been thinking about Annie

55:50.569 --> 55:55.573
all day long, what she
means to me, our memories.

55:57.358 --> 55:59.913
The good, the bad.

56:01.561 --> 56:04.176
Even when I was alone, she
was always there for me.

56:05.284 --> 56:06.668
How can I leave her now?

56:08.797 --> 56:10.778
- I can't replace Annie.

56:10.778 --> 56:11.832
No one can.

56:13.630 --> 56:17.354
What I can do is present
you with an opportunity

56:17.354 --> 56:18.755
to repay you for that night.

56:23.869 --> 56:26.271
I can promise that I will
always treat you well.

56:27.111 --> 56:28.362
Lacey can attest to that.

56:29.303 --> 56:30.604
- [Lacey] She ain't lying.

56:35.878 --> 56:36.902
- Will you join us?

56:39.751 --> 56:41.012
- All right.

56:41.012 --> 56:46.016
I mean, but you should know
that I'm totally against lies

56:46.056 --> 56:48.852
and deceit, so no more lies.

56:51.191 --> 56:54.463
Annie it taught me that
a good, honest woman

56:54.463 --> 56:57.739
is worth more than wealth, power.

57:06.675 --> 57:08.815
I won't sacrifice my,

57:08.815 --> 57:11.190
our integrity ever.

57:15.060 --> 57:16.971
What do you have to say about that?

57:22.175 --> 57:23.627
- Honest ladies of the night.

57:24.547 --> 57:26.899
Sounds like a great angle,
don't you think, CQ?

57:34.335 --> 57:37.187
- I'm not one to give up
an advantage in business,

57:37.187 --> 57:38.088
this or any other,

57:40.601 --> 57:42.264
but I'm capable of compromise.

57:48.508 --> 57:49.342
(upbeat music)

57:49.342 --> 57:50.488
- We're gonna rock this world.

57:50.488 --> 57:53.250
- Yes, to opportunity.

57:53.250 --> 57:54.304
- To integrity.

57:55.412 --> 57:56.316
- To loyalty.

57:57.334 --> 58:01.239
- And to making tons of money. Yes.

58:20.602 --> 58:23.878
- Tell me Marco, what
brings you to Los Angeles?

58:25.766 --> 58:28.799
Business or pleasure?

58:28.799 --> 58:31.801
- Oh darling, I'm make
it my personal business

58:31.801 --> 58:34.713
to never mix business and pleasure.

58:34.713 --> 58:37.449
But since you asked,
I'm all about pleasure.

58:38.977 --> 58:43.180
- That's probably the best
answer anyone has ever given me.

58:43.180 --> 58:48.184
- Ooh, doll face. I'm all about
living life to the fullest.

58:48.584 --> 58:51.704
- Well darling, you'll
see I'm full of surprises.

58:52.987 --> 58:57.991
- Oh, what come nay.
