where he was going?

01:20.776 --> 01:24.214
He was there,
and then he was just...gone.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.738
Yeah, he was talking to
Tamara, there was probably

01:26.782 --> 01:29.741
some emergency
that he had to rush off to.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.308
Come on, let's go look for him.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.789
Mom, wait,
you said to everyone

01:33.832 --> 01:36.139
that the best way to protect
ourselves is to stay at home,

01:36.183 --> 01:38.533
lock the doors, and...

01:40.317 --> 01:42.580
Be with the ones that you love.

01:42.624 --> 01:46.584
Which is why we're gonna
go look for your father.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.108
Come on.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.810
How do we get back
to our Earth?

01:54.853 --> 01:56.203
I don't know.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.726
So in all your time
with Superman,

01:57.769 --> 01:59.293
you've never experienced
anything like this,

01:59.336 --> 02:02.165
like...world suddenly changing?

02:02.209 --> 02:04.080
Nothing like this.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.430
What matters is
that we're all together.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.913
Wait...

02:10.956 --> 02:12.480
that's from our kitchen.

02:14.264 --> 02:17.354
A lot of this stuff is.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.443
My tablet.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.097
I'm gonna try
to connect with my dad.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.186
Maybe being on this world
will help somehow.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
That flickering
when we got here--

02:28.235 --> 02:30.193
it must be what happens when
the worlds start combining.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.717
But it seems totally random.
Some things blipped over,

02:32.761 --> 02:34.806
and other things
stayed exactly where they were.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.112
Well, my guess is
it'll keep happening

02:36.156 --> 02:37.418
until the two worlds
become one.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.376
And then what?
Everyone just merges

02:39.420 --> 02:42.031
with their other selves until
they become monsters like Ally?

02:42.074 --> 02:44.120
It'll be a whole world
full of parasites!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.602
Hey, we're not
gonna let that happen.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.125
You're right.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
We're not gonna
let that happen.

02:51.214 --> 02:54.174
We just need to figure out how.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.922
Hey, Nat, anything?

03:04.575 --> 03:06.098
Hey, look,
just 'cause your tech

03:06.142 --> 03:07.883
can't reach him doesn't mean
he isn't out there.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.319
That's just it though.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.625
When I was stuck
where my dad is right now,

03:10.668 --> 03:12.061
I was able to
connect to his suit.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.367
It's probably
just the two Earths.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.847
It doesn't matter!
It should work.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.200
Look, when my mom died,

03:20.243 --> 03:22.376
I wasn't with her.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.205
She was out reporting to people
on how to defend themselves.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.772
<i>I love you both.</i> <i></i>

03:30.297 --> 03:33.213

03:35.911 --> 03:39.219
I didn't get to tell her
how much I loved her

03:39.262 --> 03:41.395
or how proud I was
to be her daughter.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.049
I didn't get to say
any of that.

03:44.093 --> 03:47.662
And now I'm not gonna get
to say that to my dad either.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.674
We think he's still in
the void in-between worlds.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.197
What about Ally?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.504
It's hard to say.
My dad kept breaking up.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.506
All I could make out is
that he needs my escape pod.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.334
Then we have to figure out
a way to get it to him.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.467
Well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.469
- Tal?
- Believe me, I was

04:12.513 --> 04:13.905

to be transported

04:13.949 --> 04:15.951
to this godforsaken place
as you all were.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.823
But, given the worlds have
gone to pot and you, brother,

04:18.867 --> 04:23.045
are in no shape to do much
about it, seems my return...

04:23.088 --> 04:26.004
though I'd hoped otherwise,
is necessary.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.495

- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.766
Well, I did check him out,
and it looks like

28:44.810 --> 28:46.768
Clark's really only worked
at the "Daily Planet."

28:46.812 --> 28:48.030

- No, I know.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.177
Superman.

29:08.964 --> 29:12.011
Yeah, your husband,

29:12.054 --> 29:16.102

he's Superman.
