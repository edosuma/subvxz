00:28.279 --> 00:30.737
This is so beautiful.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.816
You know it, Gary.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.655
Look at her.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.791
Do you know what I would like to do?

00:46.922 --> 00:48.834
Shower with them.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.419
Then, bang!
We hit the city, baby, dead on.

00:54.639 --> 00:58.428
For a little drinks,
a little nightlife, a little dancing.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.640
Dancing.

00:59.769 --> 01:02.853
We throw a huge party,
I mean, huge party.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.894
Everybody's invited, women everywhere.

01:07.026 --> 01:10.144
All these girls, they're all there.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.191
- Naked bodies everywhere.
- Gary.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.064
- They all know my name.
- Gary!

01:14.200 --> 01:18.319
- What?
- Nobody likes us. Nobody.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.989
Why are you messing with the fantasy?

01:22.500 --> 01:26.710
We know about the reality.
Don't ruin the fantasy, OK?

01:28.214 --> 01:32.754
And then, we're hip, man.
We're popular. We're revered.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.218
- Man...
- We're studs.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.595
When the smoke clears, right,

01:42.645 --> 01:44.637
those two dames

01:44.772 --> 01:49.312
fall amazingly, completely and totally
in love with us, Wyatt.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.235
Check it out.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.857
Yo! Check us out!

02:15.886 --> 02:18.469
Look, we're sorry about...

'Down. Down, you fool.'

03:48.354 --> 03:50.767
You know, this isn't very scary, Gary.

03:51.941 --> 03:55.025
"I Spit On Your Grave" is scary.
This is, um...

03:55.653 --> 03:57.986
It's very mild.
It's timid, you know.

03:58.113 --> 04:01.106
The old stuff is more funny than scary.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.735
I believe the word is "camp".
It's campy.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.242
'The moon's rising.
We've no time to lose.'

04:08.374 --> 04:10.957
You ever see "Dawn of the Dead"?
"Dawn of the Dead" scared me.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.920
It really scared me.
I slept with my parents for a week, OK?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.647
I had to call my grandmother
in the night

04:16.757 --> 04:18.839
to discuss my childhood with her
for three hours.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.800
I was really petrified.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.467
'He's just resting,
waiting for a new life to come.'

04:28.602 --> 04:32.221
That would've been so much cooler
if Dr. Frankenstein had made a girl.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.320
Don't burn the butter, alright?
Ticks me off.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.661
I mean... I personally would've
made a girl, you know.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.205
They did make a girl,
"The Bride of Frankenstein".

04:54.336 --> 04:57.249
- I think it was released in '35.
- It was '34, alright?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.048
She was a scag, Wyatt,
she had, like, electric hair.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.964
If they made her beautiful,
she wouldn't go out with the monster.

05:04.597 --> 05:06.338
That's a good point.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.189
'...his insane ambition
to create life.'

05:24.325 --> 05:27.534
- Where'd your parents go, anyway?
- Cincinnati.

05:27.745 --> 05:30.533
They're meeting the guy
that my sister wants to marry.

05:31.624 --> 05:34.742
Chloe?
Who the hell would marry Chloe?

05:34.877 --> 05:36.869
He's studying to be a vet.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.669
Try not to make a mess in there, Gary.
The maid doesn't come till Monday.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.336
I don't understand something, Wyatt.

05:43.469 --> 05:46.337
How come your parents trust you?
They never let you do shit before.

05:46.472 --> 05:49.510
Chet's coming home from college
for the weekend. They trust him.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.258
He's in charge.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.885
Chet? Oh, shit!

05:54.647 --> 05:56.559
I can't believe this, Wyatt.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.899
I really wish that you told me this
before I agreed to sleep over.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.236
You know how I feel about Chet.
How do you put up with that guy?

06:03.364 --> 06:05.572
If I don't,
he beats the shit out of me.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.565
It's a habit he picked up
in military school.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.261
How do you put up
with that putz?

06:09.370 --> 06:11.370
What can I say?
He's very protective of me.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.655
Nice relationship.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.125
'...there you have his mad dream.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.293
'Look! There's nothing to fear.

06:22.424 --> 06:28.637
'Look... no blood, no decay,
just a few stitches.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.177
'Go on. Fix the electrodes.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.676
'You'll have plenty to be afraid of
before the night's over.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.804
'The storm will be magnificent.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.431
'All the electrical secrets of heaven.

06:40.693 --> 06:43.777
'And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.612
'Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.'

06:50.911 --> 06:54.655
'Here in this machine,
I have discovered the great ray

06:54.790 --> 06:57.749
'that first brought life into the world.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.243
'And, look, here's the final touch.

07:03.132 --> 07:06.625
'The brain you stole, Fritz.
Think of it.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.924
'The brain of a dead man
waiting to live again

07:10.055 --> 07:13.469
'in a body I made
with my own hands...'

07:13.600 --> 07:16.217
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- What?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.811
'In 15 minutes,
the storm should be at its height...'

07:18.939 --> 07:20.771
Making a girl.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.561
Actually making a girl.

07:28.032 --> 07:29.773
Just like Frankenstein.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.324
Except cuter.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.621
- You're serious.
- Yes.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.880
Look me in the eyes.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.795
Do I look serious?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.839
- 'You're crazy!'
- 'Crazy, am I?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.930
'We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.'

07:54.683 --> 07:57.972
Gary Wallace, that's absolutely gross.
That's sick.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.265
I'm not digging up dead girls. It's...

08:03.400 --> 08:07.189
No, I'm not talking about digging up
a dead girl, Wyatt.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.734
I'm talking about your system, idiot.
Your computer.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.636
OK, you know how you're always talking
how you can simulate all that stuff

08:13.660 --> 08:16.152
on your computer, you know?

08:16.288 --> 08:18.780
What's the difference?
Why can't we simulate a girl?

08:18.916 --> 08:22.409
I don't know.
I guess I could, but why?

08:22.544 --> 08:26.003
It's two-dimensional on the screen.
It's not flesh and blood, Gary.

08:26.131 --> 08:30.171
I know that, but we can use it, Wyatt.
We can ask it questions.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.942
We can put it in real-life sexual situations
and see how it reacts.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.388
Like real sick, demented shit.
You'd love it.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.260
Well, what about your girl in, um...
Canada?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.475
She lives in Canada. This girl has
no morals. I don't like that in a girl.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.894
It's rough having those kind
of relationships. You'll see.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.018
Anyway, get to work.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.949
Very nice.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.124
I'm telling you, Wyatt. If there's
one thing I know, it's female stats.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.541
Anything bigger than a handful,
you're risking a sprained tongue.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.413
You know, and...

09:08.549 --> 09:09.915
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:12.136 --> 09:15.254
- Perfect.
- OK. Now what?

09:16.765 --> 09:19.052
Should we give her a brain?

09:19.184 --> 09:22.348
- Yeah. We can play chess with her.
- Chess?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.892
Just give her a brain, OK?

09:33.740 --> 09:37.279
OK, that's about all we can do
with my stuff.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.620
I can't believe this shit.
I can't believe this.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.864
Did you get a free toaster
with this, too?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.162
Gary, it's smarter than you, OK?

09:45.294 --> 09:48.287
- The problem is, it's a lame idea, OK?
- It's not a lame idea.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.317
The problem is your computer's a wimp
and we need a lot more power than this.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.877
What do you suggest?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.679
'We have code penetration,
we have program entry.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.550
'I repeat, we have code penetration,
we have program entry.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.978
'Activate LAN trace.'

10:50.025 --> 10:51.357
We're in.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.317
We're in trouble, Gary.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.277
This is highly illegal.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.318
Well, you need more input.
We got to fill this thing up with data.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.067
We gotta make her
as real as possible, Wyatt.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.196
I want her to live,
I want her to breathe.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.493
I want her to aerobicize.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.448
'It's live! All Dave, all night!

11:44.913 --> 11:51.001
'We know what you need.
Only right here on Dave TV!'

11:52.004 --> 11:54.747
Look at this. It's moving, it's working.
It's doing itself.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.543
It's working by itself.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.237
Gary?

12:20.282 --> 12:23.400
By the way, why are we
wearing bras on our heads?

12:24.161 --> 12:25.493
Ceremonial.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.289
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.302
- Turn it off!
- It is off!

12:48.352 --> 12:50.810
Hang up the phone!

13:00.197 --> 13:02.610
- Wyatt, what's going on?
- I don't know!

13:02.741 --> 13:04.983
- Well, unplug it!
- OK!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.746
Oh, shit!

13:23.387 --> 13:25.754
No! It was a birthday present!

13:30.060 --> 13:31.596
Oh, shit!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.054
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

13:35.190 --> 13:38.228
Oh, shit! We got to get this thing
out of your house!

13:38.360 --> 13:40.272
You get it out! It was your idea!

13:40.362 --> 13:42.319
This is all your fault, you son of a bitch!

13:42.447 --> 13:44.780
Hit the lights out!
You get it out!

13:44.866 --> 13:46.448
I'll get it out!

14:08.974 --> 14:11.261
- Whoa!
- Aargh!

14:12.602 --> 14:14.468
Ah, shit!

14:45.260 --> 14:46.671
One, two, three.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.764
'She's alive. Alive!'

14:59.357 --> 15:04.443
So... what would you little maniacs
like to do first?

15:09.493 --> 15:13.203
You guys created me.
I didn't come from anywhere.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.415
Before you started messing around
with your computer, I didn't even exist.

15:20.420 --> 15:25.131
By the way... you did an excellent job.
Thank you.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.132
Hello?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.593
Showering's real fun, isn't it?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.651
If we're going to have
any kind of fun together,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.113
you guys had better loosen up.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.573
What are we going to do with her?

15:58.708 --> 16:02.372
Look... we'll just go
with the situation, OK?

16:02.504 --> 16:04.336
I'm sure by Sunday,
you'll think of something.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.956
You're a very bright guy.
I have a lot of faith in you, OK?

16:07.092 --> 16:09.960
- Alright?
- I'm just being practical.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.462
Well, I know you are, OK?
And I appreciate it.

16:12.597 --> 16:13.838
Let's go.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.632
What are we going to do
about this mess?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.556
Wyatt, you'll have plenty of time
to clean up tomorrow, OK?

16:19.688 --> 16:23.272
OK, but don't get any B.O. on Chet's suit,
or he'll kill me.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.269
- Where are we going, anyway?
- I dunno.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.944
She said we're going to go downtown...
Oh, my God! Whose stuff is this?

16:32.075 --> 16:34.136
- Is that your suit? Wait, is this yours?
- Oh, shit.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.494
Holy shit!
Wyatt, what's going on here?

16:37.622 --> 16:39.600
- Gary, I don't know!
- I don't know what's going on here!

16:39.624 --> 16:40.990
You look good, though, alright?

16:41.126 --> 16:42.458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.676
- So, did you steal this car?
- No, I didn't steal the car.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.262
How'd you get it?

16:55.390 --> 16:57.757
I can get anything I want.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.056
- And right now, I want to party.
- Party?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.726
Yeah, and you better think up
a name for me, too.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.690
What name do you want?

17:06.818 --> 17:09.902
You guys created me,
you think of a name for me.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.521
How about Lisa?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.067
Why Lisa?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.192
Why not?

17:16.328 --> 17:20.914
- He used to like a girl named Lisa.
- Oh, yeah? Old girlfriend?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.828
She kicked him in the nuts.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.248
Will you shut up?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.463
Look, Gary, it wasn't your fault.
All you said was hello to her.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.628
Yeah, look, Wyatt, shut up!

17:32.761 --> 17:36.721
Hey, guys, I like Lisa.
That'll do just fine.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.888
OK, you guys ready to rock?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.682
- Ready.
- Ready.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.708
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

18:12.050 --> 18:16.545
- I don't think we belong here.
- Don't be silly. It's a public place.

18:20.392 --> 18:24.386
Look, I'm sure we'd both love to stay,
but we're not 21, so I think...

18:24.521 --> 18:27.605
You're 21. You're 21.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.361
Well, maybe you'd feel better
if you just got out there and mingled.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.606
We don't mingle, OK?

18:37.492 --> 18:40.485
Well, maybe you'd be comfortable
if I invited all these people

18:40.620 --> 18:44.990
back to your house
and we could all mingle there.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.957
- We'll mingle.
- We'll mingle.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.130
Hi, dudes.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.677
Well, goddamn!

19:09.149 --> 19:11.186
Listening to this blues music
reminds me

19:11.317 --> 19:14.276
of my own trials and tribulations
as a young guy and, uh...

19:14.404 --> 19:18.648
You know, my folks, they really,
really dump on me. They really do.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.075
So, you guys get along
with your parents?

19:25.457 --> 19:28.746
I guess you guys moved out
by now though, huh?

19:31.713 --> 19:34.251
- Uh, what's this, sir?
- Drink it.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.967
Uh...

19:39.095 --> 19:42.588
That's a very sweet thought of both
you gentlemen, but I really don't...

19:45.643 --> 19:47.054
Until now.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.895
See you guys
in the emergency room, huh?

19:54.027 --> 19:57.395
Hello, pretty lady.
Tell me something.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.240
What's a beautiful broad like you
doing with a malaka like this, huh?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.531
It's purely sexual.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.119
No shit.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.663
She's into malakas, Dino.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.504
She's into malakas!
Do you believe that?

20:21.763 --> 20:23.470
You can say that again!

20:40.949 --> 20:45.319
Fats, man...
let me tell you my story, man.

20:45.995 --> 20:50.990
Last year, I was insane
for this crazy little 8th-grade bitch.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.616
- OK?
- Crazy insane?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.334
- Insane?
- Crazy?

20:54.462 --> 20:56.704
I was nuts for the woman, man.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.924
Now you gotta believe me,
I'm telling the truth here.

21:00.051 --> 21:04.341
I'm speaking to you.
I mean, I was nuts for the girl.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.055
And what did it to me
was these big titties she had.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.425
For a 13-year-old girl, man!

21:09.561 --> 21:12.498
She wouldn't have had to worry about
no titties for the rest of her life, boy.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.230
You know, she was set
and she was looking good.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.849
That's the truth, baby.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.102
I called her every night
for, like, a month.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.149
I mean, I'm talking devotion, man.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.273
Every damn night?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.168
Every night, Mitch.
I ain't playing with you.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.117
On the telephone?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.246
What's this boy talking about,
on the telephone, man?

21:31.374 --> 21:33.331
Explain it to him.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.325
Goddamn.
We know there's a telephone, boy!

21:35.461 --> 21:38.670
- What the hell he think I'm doing?
- But he hung up on her.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.757
Oh, you didn't hang up on her?
The chick with those big, big titties?

21:41.885 --> 21:45.629
I hung up on the bitch.
Now here's the capper.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.130
- You know what the bitch did to me?
- Lay it on me.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.679
Check this shit out.
Listen to what she did to me. She...

21:50.810 --> 21:54.599
She kneed you in the nuts and
called him faggot in front of everybody.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.814
- She did what?
- Bitch kneed your nuts?

21:56.941 --> 21:58.148
Bitch kneed my nuts!

21:58.276 --> 22:00.563
Bitch. I'm not playing with you.
I ain't teasing, man.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.529
- In the family jewels?
- In the family jewels, man.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.444
- Worst pain there is.
- Broke my heart in two.

22:06.576 --> 22:10.616
- She broke more than your heart.
- You're right there, baby.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.613
You can forget that other one.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.991
You got this fine jewel
sitting right over here by you.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.914
- Yeah.
- Ain't that the truth, baby?

22:18.046 --> 22:21.414
- That's the plain truth...
- Uh-oh, there he goes!

22:24.802 --> 22:28.136
- Party's over.
- Party's over, said the girl.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.803
I'm gonna get out of here. I got money
for you right here. $50 for you.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.557
- I got $500 that boy won't make it.
- I bet he's gonna make it.

22:39.692 --> 22:44.483
♪ Ooh, baby,
Baby, you know I love you

22:49.118 --> 22:52.156
You know, I really shouldn't be driving.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.998
Hey, listen, I appreciate it. You know,
I really just don't feel like driving.

22:57.251 --> 23:00.289
OK, forget it. I'll drive.
Give me the keys!

23:00.421 --> 23:02.413
Give me the keys!

23:02.548 --> 23:04.631
Is he going to be all right?

23:04.759 --> 23:07.627
I don't know. I warned him
about that Blind Dog bourbon.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.880
Hey, he don't even have
his license, Lisa.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.758
He's not lying.
I don't even have a learner's permit.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.351
Hey, let's scout another party, man.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.726
What are you gonna tell Chet
about me?

23:19.857 --> 23:21.439
Nothing.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.183
Nothing?

23:23.319 --> 23:25.402
That's not very realistic, Wyatt.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.365
Look, I don't know. I'm just trying
to concentrate on the road.

23:29.492 --> 23:33.406
You better concentrate a little harder.
You're about to run a red light.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.454
Oh, shit!

23:44.382 --> 23:46.669
I hate that boy!
I always hated that shit!

23:46.801 --> 23:50.044
I never listen to him!
I hate this car! I hate it!

23:50.179 --> 23:51.590
Are you OK?

23:53.474 --> 23:57.263
Well, my nuts are halfway up my ass,
but other than that, I'm perfect!

23:58.146 --> 24:00.763
You better think of what
you're going to do about Chet.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.185
He's one serious idiot.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.604
You're stewed, butt wad!

24:07.071 --> 24:08.437
Who, me?

24:08.573 --> 24:10.439
Know what time it is?

24:10.575 --> 24:12.817
Um... 2:00?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.160
Time to pay the fiddler.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.587
Um... I was kind of counting on you
to be human about this.

24:31.929 --> 24:34.137
Here's the bottom line, Wyatt.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.682
I'm telling Mom and Dad everything.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.770
I'm even considering
making up some shit.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.356
Alright, Chet, name your price.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.400
$175 and zero cents, cash.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.946
New bills, crisp and clean,
in my wallet by 7:00 a.m.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.573
Thank you.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.789
Hey, what are big brothers for?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.000
See you upstairs.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.500
- I don't need you.
- Shh!

25:13.888 --> 25:15.754
The boozehounds return.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.640
What a joke!

25:18.768 --> 25:20.384
Hi, girls.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.814
Feeling kind of queasy?

25:33.950 --> 25:40.038
How about...
a nice greasy pork sandwich

25:40.164 --> 25:42.781
served in a dirty ashtray?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.836
He pukes, you die.

25:56.973 --> 25:59.090
He's not laughing at you, Chet.
It's just...

25:59.225 --> 26:01.262
Yes, I am.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.603
Did you tell Chet about...? Did he tell you
about the woman we made tonight?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.393
He's obviously had it.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

26:07.525 --> 26:11.064
- No shit?
- No shit, Chet. No shit.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.688
You two donkey dicks
couldn't get laid in a morgue.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.941
You're right.
You are absolutely right.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.659
- You're absolutely right, Chet...
- Get him outta here.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.995
- What?
- Come on.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.836
Cold-blooded shit he is.
He's an asshole.

26:36.971 --> 26:40.339
Look at his haircut. Anybody with a haircut
like that you know is an asshole...

26:59.118 --> 27:00.905
Psst! Lisa.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.615
Where are you?

27:07.543 --> 27:09.535
I'm right behind you.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.585
Surprise!

27:22.725 --> 27:24.557
I'm not going to hurt you,
you silly thing.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.428
I mean, your lips.
They feel like rigor mortis has set in.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.772
Why don't you try and relax a little bit?
I'm only kissing you.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.690
I wasn't expecting you to kiss me.
I was just...

27:48.417 --> 27:50.249
That was better.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.463
Want to try it again?

27:54.590 --> 27:58.630
If you don't mind.
I mean, yes, please, ma'am.

28:17.488 --> 28:21.823
- You sure you're only 15?
- I'll be 16 in June.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.360
You made me.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.654
You control me.

28:33.087 --> 28:36.421
What's on your mind?
What are you thinking about, huh?

28:36.549 --> 28:37.756
Um...

28:38.801 --> 28:40.758
Women's gymnastics.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.755
Well, I don't know.
I'll do my best.

28:46.142 --> 28:47.474
Good.

29:24.180 --> 29:29.016
Wyatt, Wyatt, Wyatt, where are you?

29:29.143 --> 29:32.227
- I'm right here, Gary.
- Wyatt, what happened?

29:32.355 --> 29:33.971
I don't know.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.063
I think it was a dream.

29:38.819 --> 29:39.980
What?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.149
Everything. Last night. Lisa.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.364
The whole thing,
it had to be a dream.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.951
It can't be a dream, Wyatt.
We were both in it.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.696
How can two people
have the same dream?

29:51.624 --> 29:53.911
There's no other explanation.
It had to be a dream.

29:54.043 --> 29:57.081
Wait, let's analyze this.
Alright, in your dream...

29:58.381 --> 30:00.781
did I get up in the middle of the night
and yak in your sink?

30:01.842 --> 30:05.176
Didn't throw up. No. Nothing.
You didn't see anything.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.341
Maybe it was a dream, you know.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.888
A very weird, bizarre, vivid...

30:13.437 --> 30:17.556
...erotic, wet, detailed dream.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.729
Maybe we have malaria.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.606
Shit.

30:30.371 --> 30:33.955
Gary! Wyatt! Breakfast!

30:38.254 --> 30:41.463
Look, I don't have the kind of bucks
it would take to pay Chet off about this.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.252
Yo, Wyatt! Coffee!

30:43.384 --> 30:46.923
You can't live in fear of Chet
for the rest of your life.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.011
Why not? Just please...

30:51.434 --> 30:55.895
I don't know, Wyatt. I mean,
it's seriously affecting your sex life.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.890
Ten seconds into my gymnastics routine,
you passed out.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.482
You slept.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.064
I did my toes.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.904
By the way, you're very cute.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.740
We'll try it again
some other time, OK?

31:13.497 --> 31:16.661
- Good morning, turd brain.
- Hi, Chet.

31:21.797 --> 31:25.837
- You spit in this?
- Not that I'm aware of, no.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.044
Hey, that looks pretty good.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.427
Now make yourself one, dick weed.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.611
I like your panties.

31:46.739 --> 31:50.073
It's a joke, Chet. You know, it's all...

31:50.201 --> 31:54.161
That's not a joke!
That is a severe behavioral disorder.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.780
Those are women's underpants!

31:56.916 --> 31:59.624
The next thing you know,
you'll be wearing a bra on your head.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.163
The old man's gonna have a stroke
on this one for sure.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.503
Alright, Chet. How much?

32:07.635 --> 32:09.001
How much?

32:09.136 --> 32:12.550
Oh, this goes way beyond payment, pal.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.547
Come on, Chet. Please?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.804
Well...

32:20.439 --> 32:22.726
Your VCR should cover it.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.850
For openers.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.396
Thank you.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.189
For Christ's sakes,
will you cover yourself?

32:50.177 --> 32:53.796
You guys looking for something
for your mom?

32:55.849 --> 32:58.387
I really don't think so... Sue.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.688
You guys have, uh... girlfriends?

33:03.816 --> 33:06.729
You know, Sue,
one does really not refer

33:06.860 --> 33:09.648
to a 23-year-old woman as a girlfriend.

33:10.281 --> 33:12.568
- A mistress, Gar.
- Mistress.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.566
- Lover.
- Sexpot.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.910
She's a sexpot is what she is.

33:17.037 --> 33:21.998
You guys are the ones that got beat up
at the homecoming game, right?

33:22.126 --> 33:23.742
Hmm...

33:25.879 --> 33:30.965
Uh... Susan, do you think you could
wrap up a bottle of this scent for me?

33:31.093 --> 33:33.801
- I like this.
- Um... two.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.387
And why don't you set yourself up
with one of them, too.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.758
Set yourself up.
That's three scents, please.

33:39.893 --> 33:43.102
- If you were a 15-year-old boy...
- Hmm...

33:43.897 --> 33:46.514
- ...would these turn you on?
- Hmm...?

33:47.568 --> 33:50.151
I think so, too. I'll take them.

33:56.952 --> 34:00.161
Uh... do you have a bra
to match that?

34:00.289 --> 34:03.248
Something in leather or rubber,
or barb wire?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.332
Give me a break.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.788
Check it out. Check it out.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.208
What?

34:15.971 --> 34:17.257
Five bucks?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.800
Finsky.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.309
Max, what are you gonna do?

34:27.650 --> 34:30.141
- You know what, Gar?
- Hmm?

34:30.277 --> 34:33.987
For the first time in my life,
I don't feel like a total dick.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.605
Yeah, me either.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.286
Sorry, boys.
Momentary loss of motor nerves.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.665
Getting tired of this? We're not.
But I'll tell you, there is a cure.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.635
Rumor has it,
there's a big white sale going on.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.924
- At Towel World!
- Towel World!

34:59.973 --> 35:02.181
- We're not impressed.
- No.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.936
Can I have some of that, please?

35:13.362 --> 35:15.354
You know I'm getting
really bored of their shit.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.277
- Well, do you wanna dump them?
- I don't know.

35:18.409 --> 35:21.993
We have been with them three months.
We've been to the parties, met the people.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.738
We won't go to any more parties
and we won't meet any more people.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.865
We'll go into a social coma.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.329
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.872
We're sorry.

35:31.004 --> 35:34.042
- Wanna give them another chance?
- OK.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.000
- Will you forgive us?
- Please.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.002
Oh, you guys.

35:39.722 --> 35:42.135
What are we gonna do with you?

35:49.273 --> 35:50.684
♪ Whoo!

35:56.822 --> 36:00.486
♪ Pretty woman,

36:38.238 --> 36:39.445
Hey!

36:40.199 --> 36:41.406
Hi.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.989
- That's Ian.
- This is Max.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.117
We call him Mad Max.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.125
- We saw you on the escalator.
- Yeah.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.629
Yeah, you were looking at us, right?

36:56.757 --> 36:58.248
Yeah.

37:04.473 --> 37:07.841
- So what are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm waiting for my ride.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.734
Lis, come on, hon. We're running late.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.826
Honey, move.

37:28.497 --> 37:30.329
Speak to you later.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.878
She likes the rough stuff.
What can I do, you know?

37:49.935 --> 37:53.349
By the way, there's a party
tonight at Wyatt's house.

37:53.480 --> 37:57.645
You can find his name in
the students' directory under Donnelly.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.358
Pass the word around.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.315
Party?

38:13.208 --> 38:14.665
Don't ask.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.065
Wyatt, you're gonna have a heart attack
by the time you're 40

38:19.089 --> 38:21.422
if you don't learn to relax.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.792
Have you tried inversion boots?

38:24.678 --> 38:27.637
Lisa, you don't understand my parents.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.681
What's there to understand?

38:30.809 --> 38:34.223
They're oppressive, meddlesome,
difficult, demanding and totally bizarre.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.141
I mean, they're normal parents.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.016
Now stop worrying
and go and get dressed.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.477
Lisa, I created you.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.321
Why do you do insist
on doing things I don't want?

38:45.449 --> 38:48.032
Honey buns, you want to party so badly,
you could bottle it.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.520
I mean, you and Gary,
you want friends, you want popularity,

38:50.579 --> 38:52.366
you want all that stuff, right?

38:52.497 --> 38:55.205
Well, I've thought about it, sure, but...

38:56.752 --> 38:58.835
So I'm giving it to you.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.379
Thank you, really, thank you.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.090
But I don't want it in my house.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.837
If you want to be a party animal,
you have to learn to live in the jungle.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.464
Now stop worrying
and go and get dressed.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.058
I'm going to go and pick up Gary.

39:14.186 --> 39:16.519
I can't wait to meet his parents.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.984
Do you go to Gary's school?

39:28.992 --> 39:31.951
Do I look like I'm in high school?

39:32.079 --> 39:33.320
No.

39:33.455 --> 39:37.790
Well, what it is, Dad, she's a foreign
exchange student, you know,

39:37.918 --> 39:40.831
and they have, like, a different
educational system around the world.

39:40.963 --> 39:42.579
You look very, er...

39:43.966 --> 39:45.377
...mature.

39:45.509 --> 39:49.719
Doesn't she? That's funny you say that
cos I was thinking the same thing.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.428
And what happened was that, uh...

39:51.556 --> 39:53.639
So what do you do for a living, Al?

39:54.184 --> 39:56.471
I'm an independent businessman.

39:56.603 --> 40:01.064
Al... Dad... My dad's a plumber.
And he's into plumbing.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.649
And, well, I guess you plumb,
right, Dad?

40:04.653 --> 40:06.269
Yeah.

40:06.405 --> 40:08.271
Yeah, well, I, uh...

40:08.407 --> 40:12.117
- I think it's time to go. You ready?
- Where do you think you're going?

40:12.244 --> 40:14.236
- To a party.
- To a movie.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.239
Movie party is what it is, folks.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.957
- We're going to a movie party.
- Such a little liar.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.795
No, I've whipped up this nasty little
<i>soirée</i> over at his friend Wyatt's house.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.882
- "Soir" what?
<i>- Soirée</i>, honey. I think that means party.

40:29.011 --> 40:30.377
Party.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.615
You know, there's going to be
sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll,

40:32.639 --> 40:34.505
chips, dips, chains, whips...

40:34.641 --> 40:37.224
You know, your basic
high school orgy type of thing.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.971
I mean, I'm not talking
candle wax on the nipples

40:41.106 --> 40:42.938
or witchcraft or anything like that.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.979
No, no, no, no,
just a couple of hundred kids

40:46.111 --> 40:48.945
running around in their underwear
acting like complete animals.

40:49.072 --> 40:52.236
Alright, goddamn it! I've heard enough!

40:52.367 --> 40:54.404
- Gary, you get to your room!
- Yes, sir!

40:54.536 --> 40:57.779
No, it's OK. Just sit here.
I'll take care of this.

40:57.914 --> 41:02.158
Girlie, you get the hell outta here
before I throw you out.

41:02.294 --> 41:04.536
Don't threaten me, Al!

41:04.671 --> 41:07.209
You're out of shape.
I'll kick your arse.

41:07.340 --> 41:11.505
I'm going to make
this real easy for you.

41:11.636 --> 41:15.095
I'm taking Gary to a party.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.010
Over my dead body.

41:17.142 --> 41:22.809
He's a good kid. He studies hard.
You've got no complaints.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.431
If anybody should be bitching,
it should be Gary.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.442
You ever compliment him
on his grades?

41:28.570 --> 41:30.937
You ever compliment him
on anything?

41:31.073 --> 41:34.282
Hey! Hey!
Look, Ma, compliments embarrass me.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.150
- Dad, you know...
- Shut up!

41:37.954 --> 41:40.412
Have you ever wondered how sad it is

41:40.540 --> 41:43.453
that your son's only sexual outlet

41:43.585 --> 41:46.828
is tossing off to magazines
in the bathroom?

41:46.963 --> 41:48.750
Oh, Gary!

41:48.882 --> 41:52.592
Ma, I never tossed off to anything!

41:52.719 --> 41:56.258
- You told me you were combing your hair!
- But I was! I was! Mom!

41:56.389 --> 41:59.348
- Gary, shut up!
- The water's running all day long...

41:59.476 --> 42:02.139
- Shut up!
- I've never tossed off!

42:02.270 --> 42:05.559
- I've never tossed off!
- And you wouldn't tell your own mother!

42:05.690 --> 42:06.851
Shut up!

42:06.983 --> 42:09.191
Shut up! Shut up!

42:11.738 --> 42:14.731
This guy deserves a party.

42:15.325 --> 42:18.033
Look, I don't know who you are,

42:18.161 --> 42:21.450
what you are,
or where you came from,

42:22.207 --> 42:24.540
but I'm not taking any more of this.

42:25.502 --> 42:29.291
Dial the police, Lucy.
Dial the damn police and give me the phone.

42:29.422 --> 42:33.507
The phone...
I'm going to get the...

42:33.635 --> 42:36.878
- Give me the phone.
- I'm trying to... Well, here it is.

42:43.478 --> 42:47.267
Jesus, God. Oh, Christ.

42:47.399 --> 42:49.812
Oh, Lord God.

42:52.863 --> 42:55.401
Oh... Uh-oh...

42:56.366 --> 42:57.982
Go ahead...

42:58.827 --> 43:00.489
Make your day?

43:06.334 --> 43:08.872
I'm really sorry it has to come to this.

43:09.004 --> 43:10.495
Come to what?

43:11.756 --> 43:14.874
If you don't cheer up,
I'll blow your face off.

43:27.314 --> 43:29.977
Oh, come on, don't be such an old lady.
Everything's cool.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.145
Everything's cool!
Everything's cool.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.234
Yeah, yeah.
My dad's going to castrate me.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.354
And my mother almost had,
like, a cardiac arrest.

43:36.489 --> 43:39.635
My parents'll never let me in the house,
and if they do, I'll be grounded till I'm 45.

43:39.659 --> 43:41.762
Other than that, everything's great.
Everything's just really cool.

43:41.786 --> 43:44.199
I mean, you know, it couldn't be better.

43:45.332 --> 43:47.494
Listen, trust me for once, will you?

43:49.753 --> 43:52.245
They don't know what happened.

43:55.508 --> 43:59.343
Did you think Gary was acting
a little strangely this evening?

44:01.389 --> 44:02.675
Gary?

44:04.142 --> 44:05.599
Who's Gary?

44:10.357 --> 44:13.316
Lisa, you have to promise me

44:13.443 --> 44:15.776
that things aren't gonna
get out of control.

44:15.904 --> 44:19.648
Wyatt, don't worry.
You're just having a few friends over.

44:19.783 --> 44:21.991
I don't have any friends, Lisa.

44:22.118 --> 44:23.734
He doesn't.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.908
Boy ain't lying.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.495
You do now.

44:38.885 --> 44:39.966
Hi.

44:40.095 --> 44:42.508
Hi!

44:42.639 --> 44:43.720
Party!

44:43.848 --> 44:47.307
Party! Party! Party! Party!

Who's here? How you doing?
How you doing?

45:20.093 --> 45:21.880
- Where's the bar?
- Bar!

45:25.223 --> 45:28.011
Do you think
they'll embarrass us tonight?

45:28.143 --> 45:29.554
Yeah.

45:29.686 --> 45:31.302
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:36.651 --> 45:37.937
Caviar?

45:38.903 --> 45:41.737
If Max and Ian see her,
it is all over for us.

45:43.616 --> 45:46.700
- How's your stomach?
- It's a little better.

45:46.828 --> 45:50.196
If you're gonna float an air biscuit,
let me know, OK?

45:50.332 --> 45:51.914
Float a what?

45:52.042 --> 45:54.020
If you're gonna fart,
if you're gonna squeeze cheese,

45:54.044 --> 45:55.626
let me know, OK?
I'll hit the fan.

45:55.754 --> 45:58.747
I'm sorry, Gary,
it's just I suffer pain and discomfort

45:58.882 --> 46:01.716
due to occasional stomach upset.

46:01.843 --> 46:04.756
You know, I can't believe this, Wyatt.
I'm so disappointed in us.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.074
All we ever do is sit around
and talk about how great it would be

46:07.098 --> 46:08.555
if we went to parties, right?

46:08.683 --> 46:11.203
And now it's our party, and there are
hundreds of people here having a great time,

46:11.227 --> 46:13.059
and we're in the john.
we're in the john!

46:13.188 --> 46:16.932
- I can't believe it.
- Gary, you're just as uptight as I am.

46:17.067 --> 46:19.559
Let me tell you something.
Nobody can be as uptight as you, OK?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.731
Nobody.
Your middle name is tense, OK?

46:21.863 --> 46:23.445
Wyatt "Tense Up" Donnelly.

46:23.573 --> 46:26.236
- Alright, this is true. This is true.
- It's true.

46:26.368 --> 46:31.204
But... it's not that bad.
I mean, we can hear the music.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.531
We can dance, so that's great.

46:33.666 --> 46:36.020
If we put our noses to the door,
maybe we can smell the food.

46:36.044 --> 46:37.535
Hey, brother!

46:37.670 --> 46:40.037
What's happening, my main man?

46:40.173 --> 46:41.459
Right on!

46:42.133 --> 46:44.295
- Scotch.
- Straight up?

46:44.427 --> 46:46.134
Ah, give me the whole bottle.

46:46.262 --> 46:51.098
Tell you what... you bend over
and I'll shove it straight up your ass.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.098
On the rocks is fine.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.557
Yeah, that's what I thought
you were gonna say, you jive turkey.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.113
There she is.

47:14.249 --> 47:16.161
You deal with the drinks.
I'll kill the girls.

47:48.450 --> 47:50.362
- Hi.
- Hi!

47:52.412 --> 47:53.869
OK, OK, OK...

47:53.997 --> 47:56.239
- Did we see you at the mall today?
- Yes.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.865
Oh, yeah!

48:00.670 --> 48:03.128
It's alright... Um...

48:03.256 --> 48:05.623
- What are you doing here?
- I'm living here now.

48:05.758 --> 48:07.670
I'm Wyatt and Gary's girlfriend.

48:07.802 --> 48:10.419
No!

48:11.264 --> 48:15.429
Ah! OK...
We're Wyatt's friends.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.394
Er... can we come to the party
or should we just bail?

48:18.521 --> 48:20.103
Bail!

48:22.984 --> 48:25.397
- No, no, come in, come on.
- Really?

48:25.528 --> 48:26.939
Oh, thank you.

48:27.906 --> 48:30.193
Gary and Wyatt are around here
someplace.

48:30.325 --> 48:32.783
I wonder if Lisa's having a good time.

48:32.911 --> 48:36.450
Lisa could have a good time
at an insurance seminar, Wyatt.

48:36.581 --> 48:39.574
You know,
the thing that really galls me

48:40.793 --> 48:44.207
is that she's ours
and we can't get close to her.

48:46.799 --> 48:48.290
Hit the fan.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.887
This is, like, the best party
I've ever been to.

48:54.015 --> 48:56.302
I know. It's great!

48:56.434 --> 48:58.972
Do you know whose house this is?

48:59.103 --> 49:03.393
I don't know. I think it might be
that girl with the English accent.

49:03.525 --> 49:07.269
Did you notice that girl doesn't have a zit
on her whole body? Did you notice that?

49:07.403 --> 49:10.567
- I know. She has, like, zero fat.
- And she's so relaxed.

49:10.698 --> 49:12.781
- She burped and it was, like, charming.
- Charming.

49:12.909 --> 49:13.990
Yeah!

49:15.787 --> 49:16.994
Shit.

49:18.331 --> 49:20.163
- Ah, yeah.
- The bathroom.

49:28.258 --> 49:29.499
- Ladies.
- Hi.

49:29.634 --> 49:31.045
Hi.

49:32.554 --> 49:34.295
I can't believe you! I cannot...

49:34.430 --> 49:37.013
You're dropping wolf bait
and there are chicks outside!

49:37.141 --> 49:40.475
Light a match or something!
Light a fire, I don't know.

49:42.689 --> 49:44.430
Hi.

49:44.566 --> 49:45.977
Hi.

49:46.109 --> 49:48.647
We're sorry. We thought
there were just girls in there.

49:48.778 --> 49:51.737
- I'm sorry.
- It's just us dudes, you know.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.526
What are you doing here?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.783
Gary was just taking a shit!

49:56.911 --> 49:58.573
No, what I meant was...

50:00.873 --> 50:03.911
No, no, what I meant was,
what are you doing at the party?

50:04.043 --> 50:07.332
- Oh, it's my house.
- This is your party?

50:07.463 --> 50:10.376
Yeah, well, you know,
we like to do this about once a week,

50:10.508 --> 50:12.903
throw little gatherings here,
little get-togethers, that kind of thing.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.884
- Haven't you guys been by?
- No.

50:15.013 --> 50:17.096
No? How the heck did we miss
these two, Wyatt?

50:17.223 --> 50:19.806
I don't know.
So many people, so many parties.

50:19.934 --> 50:23.518
So many people, you know,
and so many parties, you lose track...

50:23.646 --> 50:27.265
Um... would you mind if I came in
and checked my face?

50:27.400 --> 50:29.517
What's wrong with your face?

50:31.571 --> 50:32.903
Can we come in?

50:33.031 --> 50:35.739
- Come on in.
- Sure, yeah. OK. Be our guests.

50:35.867 --> 50:38.860
- Thanks, guys.
- Come on in.

50:40.997 --> 50:42.954
Well, um...

50:43.082 --> 50:45.082
We've seen you guys at school,
but we've never met.

50:45.209 --> 50:46.575
- You're Hilly.
- You're Deb.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.202
- How you doing?
- Deb.

50:48.338 --> 50:50.330
- Hi. I'm Gary.
- I'm Wyatt.

50:50.465 --> 50:52.297
Well, what have you guys been doing?

50:54.093 --> 50:57.803
This is a wild crowd. I didn't know
you guys had so many friends.

50:57.930 --> 50:59.887
- Yeah, neither did we.
- Neither did we.

51:01.059 --> 51:05.224
Uh, who's the girl with the accent?
I thought that this was her party, but...

51:05.355 --> 51:09.224
You mean the real sensuous, exotic,
sexy, mature, sex symbol type?

51:09.359 --> 51:10.975
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:11.110 --> 51:13.443
She's with us.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.904
She's with you guys?

51:16.532 --> 51:18.569
Come on, Lisa. Why not?

51:20.495 --> 51:23.659
Because I belong to Gary and Wyatt.

51:23.790 --> 51:27.875
Belong? What? They make you
in the garage with power tools?

51:28.002 --> 51:30.085
They own you? Control you?

51:30.213 --> 51:33.001
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

51:33.132 --> 51:34.498
They're toads.

51:34.634 --> 51:37.217
Do I look like I'd go out
with two toads?

51:38.513 --> 51:41.506
You do. It's true.

51:41.641 --> 51:45.806
I think Gary and Wyatt are gonna force
everyone to redefine their terms.

51:47.689 --> 51:50.557
And you're completely loyal to them?

51:50.692 --> 51:53.810
I do whatever they say.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.367
Hi.

52:09.168 --> 52:12.787
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

52:12.922 --> 52:15.881
Ah, that's no problem.
Yeah, we'll be in here.

52:16.008 --> 52:17.419
Yeah.

52:25.351 --> 52:26.967
OK, fine.

52:30.606 --> 52:32.835
I could be wrong, but I think
these ladies are stoked for us, Wyatt.

52:32.859 --> 52:34.619
- I got that feeling myself.
- What do we do?

52:34.736 --> 52:36.213
- I don't know.
- Should we go for it?

52:36.237 --> 52:38.048
- What about Lisa?
- She did say we should party.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.300
Let's get it on with these two,
score points and go back to Lisa.

52:40.324 --> 52:41.656
This is like a dream come true.

52:41.784 --> 52:44.680
How about if we see if we can score
with these two in case we can't later?

52:44.704 --> 52:46.741
- Sounds good.
- But we gotta give Lisa a shot.

52:46.873 --> 52:50.207
I don't wanna hurt her feelings. The girls
want a long, lean bone job from me.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.745
- Ready to party down?
- 10-4.

52:51.878 --> 52:53.119
- Let's break.
- Break.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.383
Those guys are weird,
but they're kind of cute.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.009
- Hi.
- Hi!

53:09.145 --> 53:12.559
And where did you two disappear to?

53:12.690 --> 53:15.933
- Nowhere. We were in the kitchen.
- We were in the bathroom.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.727
- Eating.
- Doing our hair.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.855
Have you met Gary and Wyatt?

53:21.449 --> 53:23.486
- Yeah.
- No.

53:23.618 --> 53:24.904
Sort of.

53:26.996 --> 53:30.615
If you get the chance... shower with them.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.788
I did. It's a mind scrambler!

53:34.629 --> 53:36.621
Oh! Hurts so good.

53:42.303 --> 53:44.545
She took a shower with them.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.514
- I have a wonderful idea, Henry.
- Hmm?

53:47.642 --> 53:51.761
After dinner, why don't we stop by
and visit with Wyatt?

53:51.896 --> 53:55.731
I hate to think of his being
alone at home tonight.

53:55.858 --> 53:59.568
- Doesn't he have anything to read?
- Well, I don't know, dear.

53:59.695 --> 54:03.063
But you know nothing's
more important to a teenage boy

54:03.199 --> 54:05.407
than his grandparents.

54:05.535 --> 54:07.447
- We'll drop by.
- Oh, good.

54:21.342 --> 54:25.837
I'd like to open up by apologizing
for the Icee today at the mall.

54:25.972 --> 54:28.680
It was very immature, and I'm sorry.

54:28.808 --> 54:32.643
- And, uh...
- It was just, like, tomfoolery.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.602
But we are sorry.

54:34.730 --> 54:37.143
- It happened.
- Yeah.

54:37.817 --> 54:41.151
So what's the deal with Lisa?
You know, can we borrow her?

54:41.779 --> 54:44.146
Uh... we can't do that, guys,

54:44.282 --> 54:46.524
because common decency
prohibits us, we can't.

54:46.659 --> 54:48.070
It's not cool.

54:48.202 --> 54:50.489
- Well, she said it was cool.
- Yeah.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.456
We can't take advantage
of her loyalty. Sorry, guys.

54:54.584 --> 54:57.497
Man, but that's really selfish.
That hurts, you know.

54:57.628 --> 54:58.869
Ian, uh...

54:59.505 --> 55:01.505
Just forget it, guys,
cos we can't do it, you know?

55:01.632 --> 55:04.545
Ah, come on.
Quit being such pricks.

55:04.677 --> 55:05.793
Hey, come on.

55:05.928 --> 55:07.920
Regardless of what
she may have told you,

55:08.055 --> 55:10.263
our feelings for Lisa run very deep.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.849
It's, like, emotions.
Heavy, heavy emotions.

55:12.977 --> 55:15.845
Our feelings for Deb and Hilly run
as deep as yours do for Lisa.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.391
And it's respect.

55:17.523 --> 55:19.765
It's like the time
we spent together, you know.

55:19.901 --> 55:22.860
And a couple of guys like you
deserve them.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.525
See, we like your style.
So we wanna make a deal with you.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.773
You let us have a crack at Lisa,

55:27.909 --> 55:30.652
and then we'll let you have
Deb and Hilly.

55:32.747 --> 55:34.613
Can you guys keep a secret?

55:34.749 --> 55:37.162
- Sure.
- Secret?

55:37.293 --> 55:40.206
- Look again. It's Gary.
- No, no.

55:40.338 --> 55:42.500
It's our boy, Gary.

55:42.632 --> 55:45.466
He's our 16-year-old boy.

55:45.593 --> 55:48.336
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Lucy.

55:48.471 --> 55:50.884
And I want you to shut up.

55:51.682 --> 55:55.221
I feel like an asshole.
This had better work.

55:55.353 --> 55:57.936
This is just the blueprint.
OK, now look. You like it?

55:58.064 --> 55:59.771
Bigger tits.

55:59.899 --> 56:01.231
Go, go, go, go!

56:01.359 --> 56:03.146
Give him the knee-shooters.
I don't care.

56:05.696 --> 56:09.690
'We have code penetration again.
What the hell's going on in here?'

56:15.373 --> 56:17.205
Excuse me, Arthur.

56:17.333 --> 56:19.495
- It's Art.
- Excuse me, Art.

56:34.141 --> 56:35.598
Oh, shit.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.732
♪ Weird

56:45.277 --> 56:47.064
♪ Weird science

56:51.075 --> 56:52.907
- 'Where's Eddie?'
- 'Eddie's down in the lab.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.072
'He and Grandpa are working
on a new project.'

56:55.204 --> 56:57.787
'Another invention?'

56:57.915 --> 57:00.202
'It's got something to do with a robot.'

57:13.889 --> 57:17.132
Wyatt, what's going on?
Turn this thing off!

57:17.268 --> 57:19.385
You're gonna love it!
How you doing?

57:19.520 --> 57:22.137
I'm shitting in my pants!

58:41.477 --> 58:42.888
It worked.

59:00.996 --> 59:05.081
You had to be big shots, didn't you?
You had to show off.

59:06.252 --> 59:08.915
When are you going to learn
people will like you for what you are,

59:09.046 --> 59:11.038
not for what you can give them?

59:13.217 --> 59:15.709
In your race for power and glory,

59:15.845 --> 59:18.633
you forgot one small detail.

59:20.141 --> 59:21.973
We forgot to hook up the doll.

59:22.101 --> 59:24.684
You forgot to hook up the doll.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.228
Something's going on here, Carmen.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.690
I have a feeling we're not
going to approve, Henry.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.937
A missile! A missile!

01:00:17.907 --> 01:00:20.240
A missile in my house, Gary!

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:26.572
- Yeah, this puppy's for real, alright.
- It was an accident. Simple, you know...

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.994
Accident, my ass, Gary!

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.368
My parents are coming home.
Chet's coming home.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:35.167
- They're gonna freak out!
- They're gonna shit eggrolls.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.882
Get out! Get out! Scat!

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.627
Out of here,
you disgusting tramps!

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:42.720
You, you, you hosers!

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.840
Out! Out! Out!

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.058
My God, cut that out, would you?

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:49.456
You ought to know better
than to walk into somebody's house

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.688
and start hitting people
with your Rex Harrison hat!

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.308
This is my daughter's home.
Who the hell are you?

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:59.279
Well, I'm a very dear, close
personal friend of your grandson's.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.443
Henry, call the police.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:04.238
I will.
I'll have you incarcerated.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.783
Here's the deal, folks.

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:10.658
Gary and Wyatt,
they created me on their computer.

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:14.161
I'm not going to stand here
and listen to this baloney.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.505
He won't, you know.
He doesn't stand for baloney.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:21.168
Would you mind waiting here?
I won't be a moment.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:25.589
Have you ever?

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.719
Never.

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:32.061
Excuse me, guys.
Wyatt, your grandparents are downstairs.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.771
OK. Thanks, Lis.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.940
- Lisa!
- Yes?

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:42.109
Where are my grandparents?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.784
- Wyatt, your kitchen is blue.
- You want to try one?

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.777
Where are my grandparents, Lisa?

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:50.121
They're all taken care of, OK?

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.414
You're going to love this one.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.635
- Are they all right?
- They're fine.

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:12.477
In fact, they're better than fine.
They're not aging anymore.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.975
See? They're smiling.

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:19.230
Uh... Lisa, if any more
of his relatives drop by,

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.069
we'll be upstairs in the bathroom, OK?

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.189
That's pretty sick, Lis.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:28.026
Those guys really need
some self-confidence.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:34.500
A challenge. Something that'll bring out
their inner strength and courage.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.418
I'm so bloody clever.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.131
Now!

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.682
This Bud's for you.

01:03:44.405 --> 01:03:46.943
- This party's lame, Max.
- What about the girls?

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.609
Girls, shmirls!

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.932
Lisa! What's going on?

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.560
Aargh!

01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:37.531
Gary! Gary, Gary...

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.453
Gary, listen to me.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:42.453
There are motorcycles
in my house!

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.589
Wyatt, there are killer mutants
in your house, OK?

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.024
Screw the house.

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:50.145
Guys, you have uninvited guests.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.240
I think you better come out
and ask them to leave.

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:53.902
They're getting pretty rowdy.

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:03.162
This is an excellent chance for you
to prove your bravery and courage.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:06.286
Those are outdated concepts, alright?
Excuse us.

01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:09.960
Don't let John Wayne hear you say that.

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:12.175
The man is dead, Lisa, OK?

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.880
Well, so are you,
if you don't deal with this situation.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:21.050
No, thanks.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.764
Gary, do you feel
like a chicken?

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.650
Wyatt, if I could shoot an egg
out my ass right now, I would.

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:36.362
What about all these people?
Will they think we're cowards?

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.072
I don't know.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.992
Look, we can deal with shame, OK?
Death is a much deeper issue.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:10.482
Uh... we're going to get you guys
some drinks.

01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:12.443
You look like a Scotch man.
You want some...

01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:14.608
- We're gonna get some stuff...
- Ah!

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:18.904
Is this your party?

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.494
Uh...

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:26.704
- Well, yeah kind of.
- I don't know if you can call it a party.

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:28.542
It's just a few friends.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.911
How come...

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:35.625
...two unpopular dicks like you

01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:37.548
is having a party?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.555
I don't know. I mean, I guess I was
just asking myself that very question.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:44.346
- And I'm like dicks, sometimes...
- Look, we're very sorry.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:48.938
How would you like
all your friends here to know...

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:54.106
...that you wear a bra on your head?

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:05.326
Tossed off into any good books lately,
have we?

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.746
You two can't even take a shower

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.709
with a beautiful woman

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.587
without wearing your jeans!

01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:31.185
You!

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:32.898
Come here!

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.609
Now!

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.917
- Prepare to die, Wyatt.
- Gary, I can't wait to die.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.465
- We are gonna kick...
- Ass.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.384
OK. This is war.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.850
Hands off the girls. Let's leave
the girls out of this. Hands off.

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:12.729
I said hands off! Now!

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.529
Why don't you shut up, bitch?

01:09:31.752 --> 01:09:34.665
And as for your ugly ass,
let me tell you something.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.335
You don't come into my friend's house
with your faggot friends,

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.584
driving your motorbikes
all over his floors,

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:43.301
breaking windows, making a mess,
stinking up the place.

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.921
And believe me, you do stink.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.928
And here's what's gonna happen.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.725
You're gonna let go of the girls,

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:57.225
and you're going to apologize
to all these people.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.570
And you're gonna get on your bikes
and pedal your ugly asses out of here.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.327
So now, we're gentlemen,
so we're gonna give you a choice.

01:10:08.914 --> 01:10:11.031
Yeah, you can leave in peace...

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.958
Or you can stay and die.

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:31.308
Choice is yours.

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:11.970
Get out of here.

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:20.058
Beg your pardon.
You have a lovely home.

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:24.855
Terribly sorry.
Call me. We'll have lunch.

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.198
Can we keep this between us?

01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:31.407
I'd hate to lose my teaching job.

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:37.662
God bless you.

01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:52.473
I can't believe... You know...
Is everyone alright? I just want to know.

01:11:52.601 --> 01:11:54.684
This is so exciting.
You know, we're heroes.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:57.144
These guys came into your house
and we showed them down.

01:11:57.272 --> 01:12:00.765
I can't believe this. Know what we did?
You and me saved all these people, Wyatt.

01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:02.642
You don't understand that.
We're heroes.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.617
This could mean a guest shot on
Phil Donahue. But this is exciting, man!

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:06.904
- Gary!
- What?

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:10.400
- Where the hell did you get that thing?
- Squirt gun, man. That's it.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:23.170
That's my boys.

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:36.426
What a weird night, huh?

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.435
You really weren't afraid of those guys?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:48.521
I was scared.
But what could I do?

01:12:56.456 --> 01:13:00.791
It's probably a good idea for me not
to ask too many questions about tonight.

01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:02.376
Probably.

01:13:02.504 --> 01:13:04.996
This is a sort of a night of weird shit.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:09.091
I was wondering if I can ask you
something kind of strange?

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:16.681
Would you kiss me?

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.474
What about Ian?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.399
We all make mistakes.

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.860
- OK.
- OK...

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.492
Where do you want it?

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:41.415
Can I ask you a question?

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:42.875
Yeah.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:45.915
How do you feel about Lisa?

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.581
I love her.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.718
That's what I figured.

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:54.257
But, um...

01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:59.266
...I mean, it's definitely
a different kind of love, you know.

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:02.637
It's... it's more sisterly, you know,

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.855
like big sisterly, kind of.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:07.771
But she's so beautiful.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.106
Yeah, she's really beautiful.

01:14:14.409 --> 01:14:16.901
And her body is...

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.653
It's gorgeous.

01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:21.580
It's a nice figure.

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:23.950
So...

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.623
I mean, what would I be
compared to her?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:36.387
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:40.929
...before I knew what I wanted.

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:46.273
I know that if I could do it again...
I'd make her just like you.

01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.318
Honest.

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.573
Dead honest.
I'm like... I... You know, I...

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.519
I gotta tell you cos I'm really honest
when I say that.

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:08.377
I'm so very honest. I mean that.

01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:01.301
What the hell?

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:07.352
That little bastard. That little...

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.898
Please don't let him
have messed up my room.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:13.358
If my room's OK,
I won't kill him, I promise.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.648
I'll just hurt him real bad.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.178
Freeze.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.178
Chet!

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.059
Where's my brother?

01:16:52.192 --> 01:16:53.524
Ow!

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:57.023
Uhh... I don't know.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.196
You're dead meat, pilgrim.

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:04.739
Um...

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:07.614
Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet,
that's her nose. Come on.

01:17:07.749 --> 01:17:09.490
Now, look, she has nothing to do with it.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.915
OK. You die.

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:15.709
She walks out of here with a severe limp.

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:22.802
Aargh.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.422
I'll be back.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:34.808
That's Wyatt's older brother, Chet.
He's kind of an asshole.

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:39.603
Oh, hi, Chet.

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:42.982
What the hell is going on
around here?

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:45.029
Chet, I'm sorry, it was an accident.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.403
An accident? An accident?

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:51.867
Do you realize it's snowing
in my room, goddamn it?

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:54.772
Some real weird shit happened, Chet.
Some real weird...

01:17:54.796 --> 01:17:58.585
You don't have to be a genius
to figure that out, monkey dick.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:04.379
- Start talking, little man.
- Look, Chet, it's a real long story.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:06.492
Gary and I were messing around
with the computer Friday night,

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:09.245
and we decided to make a woman, and
she went crazy and messed up the house.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:12.228
Don't smart-mouth me,
you wormy little shit!

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.812
Why don't you just leave him alone?

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.398
Stay out of this, bimbo.
This is a family matter.

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:20.270
Chet, just let me find Lisa.
She can explain everything.

01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:23.648
She'll clear everything up, Chet.
I swear. Chet.

01:18:23.783 --> 01:18:28.323
You can have my college money
and my social security, Chet.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.655
Chet...

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:38.003
So, you guys think you can
pull one over on me, huh?

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:39.463
Huh?

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:43.300
You got everybody synched
to the same bullshit story.

01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:46.887
This isn't bullshit.
This is a Pershing missile, Chip.

01:18:47.015 --> 01:18:48.847
It's Chet.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.966
My name is Chet.

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.896
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.769
Hi, Nanny. Hi, Grampy.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.107
I'm not a moron, you know. I...

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:11.658
Was that my grandparents?

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:20.712
- Are they dead?
- Oh, no, they're just resting.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.253
What are they doing in here?

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:25.671
I put them in there.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.511
I didn't want the boys
to get into trouble.

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:32.391
And quite frankly, they weren't
having a very good time at the party.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:34.259
Not having a good time?

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:37.979
Do you think they're having a good time
being catatonic in a closet?

01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:43.979
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:49.609
Boy, I wouldn't give a squirt of piss
for your ass right now.

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:58.076
OK, that's quite enough.
You guys get the girls home.

01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:02.376
Wyatt, take the Porsche.
Gary, you take the Ferrari.

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:03.748
The Ferrari?

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:06.918
I want to be alone with Chet here.

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:09.090
- Good to see you again, Chet.
- Get out of here!

01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:11.214
Come on,
take your little hussies home!

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:14.012
Their parents are probably
worried sick.

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:21.808
Lady, I want to get
to the bottom of this, A.S.A.F.P.

01:20:21.943 --> 01:20:23.775
Oh, so do I.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:29.611
But first, I'd like to...
butter your muffin.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:31.734
Why do you have
to be such a wanker?

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.906
Because I get off on it.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:38.157
Now I want you to promise
that you'll keep your big mouth shut

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.909
about everything that has happened
here this weekend.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.709
And I want you to treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.

01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:46.628
Oh, really?

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.500
Yeah. Oh, really.

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:56.180
I can be a real serious bitch
if I don't get what I want.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:21:00.054
Ooh, hit me with your best shot.

01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:07.986
How fast are you going?

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:09.605
About 35.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:25.124
- Wait. This can't be right.
- Are you looking at the RPMs?

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:28.545
No, I think I'm looking
at about fifty tickets.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:45.436
Bye!

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:17.764
Goddamn train!

01:22:17.892 --> 01:22:20.134
Oh, my. Phew!

01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:22.974
That was great!

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:33.400
You son of a bitch!

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:37.152
Al! Al! Al, that was Gary!

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.824
Who is this Gary character?

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.117
I had a really great time last night.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:50.168
I'll probably be grounded
for a month or so, but...

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:53.542
I'll wait for you.

01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:31.087
Hilly!

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.831
I love you!

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.798
Alright!

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:49.055
I want to thank you for a great night.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:50.602
Same here.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:55.271
Deb, I have kind of a confession
to make.

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:01.535
I'm really not this cool.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.117
That's not my car.

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.662
This is not my suit.

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.410
I mean, none of those people
were my friends.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.918
Why are you telling me all of this?

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:18.628
Because I want you to like me
for what I am.

01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:21.221
Whatever you are, I like it.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:45.032
Well, um,
I'd better get going, cos, um...

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.577
...Wyatt and I still have to deal with Chet.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.746
Quit screwing around!

01:24:50.878 --> 01:24:53.871
This ain't funny, you stupid bitch!

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:56.919
Oh, now careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.

01:24:57.051 --> 01:24:58.383
Sorry.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.596
That's better.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:07.183
Would you please turn me
back to normal, please?

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.803
I haven't done anything to you.

01:25:09.939 --> 01:25:12.352
No, but you've done plenty
to your brother.

01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:15.851
- Like what?
- Well, let me see...

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:19.024
You've nagged him, harassed him,
suppressed him,

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:22.194
kept him in fear of you,
extorted money from him.

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:24.409
It's done out of love.

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:28.368
Just for that, I ought to give you
a set of elephant balls.

01:25:34.547 --> 01:25:38.541
Give me your word that
you'll leave Wyatt and Gary alone,

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.292
and I'll change you back.

01:25:40.428 --> 01:25:43.011
Oh, all right.

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:45.131
Shake on it, huh?

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.718
No, thanks. I'd rather not.

01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:52.812
Wait! Where are you going?

01:25:53.858 --> 01:25:56.100
Well, I have to go and get changed.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:58.852
- What about me?
- What about you? You'll be fine.

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:01.526
It just takes a little while
for the effect to wear off, OK?

01:26:14.003 --> 01:26:15.164
Well?

01:26:16.464 --> 01:26:18.296
I'm in love.

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:21.132
- It's great, isn't it?
- The best.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.798
You know, I'll tell you, Wyatt,

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.886
I think things are turning
around for us.

01:26:26.015 --> 01:26:27.426
I mean it.

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:29.641
OK, what about Lisa?

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:35.557
Well, I think we're gonna have
to have a talk with her.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:39.142
Think she'll understand?

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:42.813
I think so. I mean, uh...

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:45.486
I sure as hell wouldn't want
to date you.

01:26:47.203 --> 01:26:49.536
You're not my type, you know.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.327
Chet?

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:59.462
Chet?

01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:02.753
Hi, dudes!

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:09.176
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:12.676
I'm sorry for being such a shit to you
all these years.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:16.479
And, gee, well,
I want you to know that...

01:27:17.775 --> 01:27:19.482
...I love you.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:26.398
That's nasty, Wyatt.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.276
That's Chet, Gary.

01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:32.825
Hey, hey, huh...

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:40.120
Hmm!

01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:43.423
Oh, my God!

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:47.881
Lisa?

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:49.595
In here!

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:52.056
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.269
- You saw Chet?
- Yes, I did.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:58.389
You responsible?

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:00.894
Yes, I am.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.234
Lisa, we can't have him like that.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.775
It'd ruin Christmas.

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:10.400
Listen, he's gonna be fine
in half an hour.

01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:13.745
He's not going to spoil Christmas.

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:17.082
And he's not going to bug you
anymore, either.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:19.041
Um...

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.004
Lisa, we have to have a talk with you.

01:28:23.132 --> 01:28:25.340
What's on your mind?

01:28:26.135 --> 01:28:29.094
I really don't know
how to say this to you.

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:31.846
You guys found girlfriends, right?

01:28:34.268 --> 01:28:38.057
Fell in love with the two girls,
and they fell in love with you.

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:41.477
That's all I ever wanted for you.

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.066
You're not hurt?

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:47.862
Yeah, sure I'm hurt.

01:28:48.699 --> 01:28:51.157
But I wouldn't change it.

01:28:52.912 --> 01:28:57.156
I'm really just getting off
seeing you two guys straightened out.

01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:08.709
I have to go.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:26.643
Oh...

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:29.738
I've had a wonderful time.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.954
Lisa...

01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:45.916
Bye.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.328
Boys?

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:07.918
We're home!

01:31:12.885 --> 01:31:16.344
- Hi, Mr. Donnelly. How are you?
- Hi, honey.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.593
- Dad, hi.
- No, no, no, no. Like a man.

01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:23.893
So, what
did you guys do this weekend?

01:31:24.021 --> 01:31:27.105
- Not much.
- Just hung around the house, you know.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:29.224
Daddy had this crazy notion

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:32.943
you guys might throw a party
or do something nutty.

01:31:33.072 --> 01:31:34.734
- Ha-ha!
- Shit.

01:31:34.865 --> 01:31:36.276
- Not us.
- Not here.

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:37.694
No way.

01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:01.298
Shh, shh!

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:26.699
