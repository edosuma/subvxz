WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:11.185
And this is one of my faves.

00:11.228 --> 00:14.057
It's a rose gold necklace
with crystal pendant.

00:14.101 --> 00:17.974
I'm not sure if you can see on
camera, but it really sparkles.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.585
Oh. How much is that?

00:20.629 --> 00:23.806
$300, but depending
on how much you buy today,

00:23.849 --> 00:25.808
I might be able
to knock a little bit off.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.679
Does it also come
in yellow gold?

00:27.723 --> 00:30.856
Yes, and silver,
and they can all be available

00:30.900 --> 00:32.249
to ship by tomorrow morning.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.121
Officer Nazar!

00:34.164 --> 00:37.080
Military police!
Identify yourself.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.387
We're looking for Chief
Warrant Officer Rafi Nazar!

00:39.430 --> 00:41.128
Where is he?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.172
Cover back.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.695
- Who are you?
- Uh, uh, fiancée.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.829
Clear!

00:46.872 --> 00:48.091
Do you know
where your fiancé is?

00:48.135 --> 00:51.268
Um, Kay, uh,
sh-should we reschedule?

00:52.748 --> 00:54.097
What is going on?

00:54.141 --> 00:56.099
You may want
to rethink that wedding.

00:56.143 --> 00:59.233
Your fiancé is being charged
with espionage.

01:32.614 --> 01:36.096
No, not my checking account,
my savings account.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.838
I have already verified
my Social Se...

01:39.882 --> 01:41.840
Yeah, I'll hold.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.191
- Is that your bank?
- Yeah.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.714
Fighting the, uh, service fee?

01:45.757 --> 01:48.499
- Not a service fee.
- Overdraft fee?

01:48.543 --> 01:51.502
Actually, no fees at all.
They're giving me money.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.331
- What?! That's great.
- No, it's obviously a mistake.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.551
I noticed a mystery deposit
this morning.

01:56.594 --> 01:59.684
- By who?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

01:59.728 --> 02:00.816
How much was it?

02:00.859 --> 02:03.166
Dude, $10,000.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.734
Tim, hang up the phone.
- Hang up the phone.
- Wa-Wa-Wait.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.779
What are you doing?
I got to fix this.
Do you?

02:07.823 --> 02:10.869
Yes, I got-- Hello?
Yeah, is this the manager?

02:10.913 --> 02:12.784
Great. Okay,
so what happened?
McGee.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.699
What?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.658
Look sharp.
Big guy's coming in hot.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.661
Uh... Actually,
I got to call you back.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.358
Everything all right, sir?

02:21.402 --> 02:22.925
No. Where's Agent Knight?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.056
Right here.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.234
Guess I picked the wrong time
to use the restroom.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.887
What'd I miss?
We're initiating

02:28.931 --> 02:31.194
a manhunt for
a high-priority target.

02:31.238 --> 02:34.284
Chief Warrant Officer
Rafi Nazar.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.939
Overnight, stole
highly classified Navy software.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.723
The Navy thinks Nazar plans

02:38.767 --> 02:40.508
to sell the tech
to one of our enemies.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.336
- Who's the buyer?
- Navy doesn't know.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.946
What does
the technology do?

02:43.989 --> 02:47.210
Controls surveillance drones.
Nazar commands a team

02:47.254 --> 02:48.690
of UAV operators

02:48.733 --> 02:50.779
out of Joint Base
Anacostia-Bolling.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.998
As a Navy warrant officer,
he has access

02:53.042 --> 02:56.524
to a digital master key, which
operates hundreds of drones.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.526
He stole the master key?
Correct.

02:58.569 --> 03:01.572
Stole it how? Navy cybersecurity
is bulletproof.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.095
Eh, I don't care how he got it.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.271
I care about
what he does with it.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.055
He was last seen
by his fiancée

03:06.098 --> 03:07.709
leaving his house
two hours ago.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.232
Where's his fiancée now?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.581
In the conference room.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.198
- Ms. Barlow, hi.
- Rafi's not a traitor.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.417
He is not a spy.
Do you understand me?

03:20.461 --> 03:21.897
We understand
you're upset.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.028
Because you're accusing him

03:23.072 --> 03:24.378
of something he did not do.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.901
Here's what we know.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.685
He's U.A. and we are just
trying to find him.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.253
Why? So you can arrest him?

03:30.297 --> 03:32.124
So we can ask him
some questions.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.691
Rafi is a good man.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.737
I'm sure he is,
but he has disappeared,

03:35.780 --> 03:37.434
his phone is off,

03:37.478 --> 03:38.827
and there's classified
Navy software that is missing.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.656
Maybe he's in
some kind of trouble.

03:41.699 --> 03:42.961
Did you ever think of that?

03:43.005 --> 03:45.442
Have a seat.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.233
This morning, how was he acting?

03:53.276 --> 03:56.453
Totally normal.
He made me breakfast.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.629
And what about
last night?
Um...

03:58.673 --> 04:00.544
We watched a movie

04:00.588 --> 04:03.155
and went to bed around...

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
What is it?

04:07.203 --> 04:10.250
Kay, if you know something,
tell us.

04:12.164 --> 04:15.080
He said he wasn't tired,
so he decided to...

04:15.124 --> 04:16.560
To what?

04:16.604 --> 04:19.171
Go for a drive.

04:19.215 --> 04:22.523
- What time was that?
- I don't know, um, late.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.787
But when I woke up this morning,
he was right there beside me.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.354
Okay, so he got up,

04:27.397 --> 04:29.356
made you breakfast,
then he left for work?

04:29.399 --> 04:31.923
Yes.
The best thing that you can do for your fiancé

04:31.967 --> 04:34.578
right now
is to help us find him.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.277
If he contacts you,
will you let us know right away?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.757
Yeah.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.498
Got a sec?

04:41.542 --> 04:43.370
Excuse us a moment.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.466
The warrant came through
for Nazar's phone.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.250
No phone calls since
his disappearance,

04:54.294 --> 04:57.688
but he got an incoming text
at 3:46 this morning.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.037
That's right around
the same time

04:59.081 --> 05:00.343
the drone master key was stolen.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.476
What'd the text say?"It's done."

05:02.519 --> 05:03.912
Maybe Nazar had
a partner who helped him

05:03.955 --> 05:05.566
hack the software.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.394
Were you able to trace the text?

05:07.437 --> 05:09.178
It's me.

05:37.293 --> 05:40.165
♪ Bass, bass

05:47.434 --> 05:49.349
It's not Nazar.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.741
Clear.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.743
We're back here.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.354
I can't find an I.D.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.225
Don't need one.
I know who this guy is.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.360
It's Andre Kopaloff.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.405
He's a black hat hacker.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.189
You guys recognize hackers
on sight?

06:04.233 --> 06:06.888
This guy's pretty infamous.
Crazy talented.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.803
Talented enough
to hack the Navy?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.805
Oh, he's one of the few in the
world who could probably do it.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.415
So, Nazar had the access,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.286
Kopaloff had
the skills,

06:14.330 --> 06:16.463
maybe they partnered up and
stole the drone key together.

06:16.506 --> 06:19.335
Looks like, uh, their
partnership is dead.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.479
So our cyber thief
is also a killer?

06:32.522 --> 06:35.090
That's our working theory.
Kasie I.D.'d the bullets

06:35.133 --> 06:37.266
that Jimmy pulled from the body.
Nine millimeters.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.486
Nazar has a nine
registered to him.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.052
And Nazar's still in the wind?

06:41.096 --> 06:43.054
Well, we know
he's left the city.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.839
Richmond police found his car

06:44.882 --> 06:46.928
abandoned in a strip mall
an hour ago.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.408
He hasn't used credit cards

06:48.451 --> 06:50.322
or his cell phone
since he disappeared.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.150
Yeah, but he's gonna have to
come up for air eventually.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.978
No way he's gonna sell
that drone key

06:54.022 --> 06:55.240
without coming out
of the shadows.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
Why would a decorated C.W.O.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.810
with a sterling service record
suddenly steal and murder?

07:00.811 --> 07:01.986
Money.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.423
Or ideology.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.641
Ideology to what?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.338
Well, I think it's a long shot,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.863
but we need to consider Taliban.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.866
Nazar was born
in Afghanistan.

07:11.909 --> 07:14.477
His family moved to the U.S.
when he was four.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.175
- Great-uncle stayed behind.
- And did what?

07:17.219 --> 07:20.309
Three years ago, he was jailed
for being a Taliban sympathizer.

07:20.352 --> 07:23.181
Well, having criminal relatives
doesn't make you a criminal.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.488
There's more.
Nazar, two years ago,

07:25.532 --> 07:27.055
was assigned temporarily
to Kabul.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.883
We believe,
while he was there,

07:28.926 --> 07:30.101
he made contact with the uncle.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.973
You think he's been radicalized.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.496
Think it's on the table.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.238
He's got top secret
security clearance.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.545
I mean, the Navy doesn't
hand those out like candy.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.417
Not to mention the
counterintelligence polygraphs

07:41.461 --> 07:43.767
- that he has to take.
- Which Nazar passed

07:43.811 --> 07:45.508
with flying colors, we know.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.032
We're just throwing out
all theories here.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.165
Taliban controls
the Afghan government now,

07:50.208 --> 07:51.296
so I'm sure
they're in the market

07:51.340 --> 07:52.907
for classified U.S. technology.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.257
I think we need something
more concrete

07:55.300 --> 07:57.520
before we make any accusations.
Agreed,

07:57.564 --> 07:58.956
which is why Torres and Knight

07:59.000 --> 08:00.958
are searching Nazar's home
as we speak.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
Search all you want.
You're not gonna find anything.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.927
Oh, no, yeah, you're right.
I didn't find anything in here.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.279
- What's that?
- It's a gun case

08:17.322 --> 08:18.541
with no gun in it.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.238
So?

08:20.282 --> 08:22.240
So, there's supposed to be
a nine millimeter in here.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.285
Where is it?

08:23.328 --> 08:25.287
Rafi must have it.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.898
Yeah. He must.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.777
When are you
gonna be done?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.996
Just a few more minutes.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.652
You look so happy
in this photo.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.437
I was.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.048
I still am.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.617
That was the night
he proposed.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.184
He was so nervous
at dinner, and then

08:53.228 --> 08:54.838
dessert came.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.710
The ring was inside
the chocolate cake.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.321
Only problem was, I started
scarfing it down so fast,

08:59.364 --> 09:01.149
I almost ate the diamond.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.284
How long have you known Rafi?

09:07.721 --> 09:09.897
Um... We met, like,
nine months ago.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.204
Whirlwind romance.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.599
When you know, you know.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.384
Have you met his family?

09:21.082 --> 09:22.779
I don't know where you think
you're going with this,

09:22.823 --> 09:25.260
but Rafi is a proud American.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.610
You know what he did the day
after he became a citizen?

09:27.654 --> 09:30.091
He joined the Navy.
That's called patriotism.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.528
And we appreciate his service,
but the fact is,

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
innocent people
don't run and hide.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.968
Where is he?

09:38.012 --> 09:40.449
I'm done answering
your questions.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.146
You want to know
about Rafi,

09:42.190 --> 09:43.713
go ask his
fellow pilots.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.672
See if they think
he's a traitor.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.456
No. He would never do that.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.285
He's an exemplary C.W.O.
and boss.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.636
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar
is definitely not a traitor.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.725
No way in hell
he would've done this.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.118
Sorry for cursing, ma'am.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.076
It's okay,
Petty Officer.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.035
Thank you
for your help.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.648
Could we talk about the, uh,
elephant in the room?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.476
I mean,
someone's got to do it.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.521
Sure.
Who are you?

10:09.565 --> 10:13.264
Mike Novaski. Navy contracts me
to, uh, debug the software.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.396
What do you know?

10:14.439 --> 10:15.527
I know the Navy
should've never

10:15.571 --> 10:17.094
given him
top secret clearance.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.356
Why?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.794
Well, I'm definitely
not a racist, but

10:20.837 --> 10:24.319
somebody's got to say it.
"Rafi Na-zayr"?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.149
You know he wasn't
even born here, right?

10:28.192 --> 10:31.456
Last week, I heard him
talking on the phone, Afghan.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.198
Probably hatching his plot.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.939
It's called, uh, Pashto.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.245
What is?

10:37.288 --> 10:39.203
The language of Afghanistan.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.031
Oh. I don't care.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.598
But you get what
I'm trying to say, right?

10:42.642 --> 10:43.773
Oh, loud and clear.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.645
Point is,
talking foreign--

10:45.688 --> 10:47.255
it's a red flag.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.221
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.789
Captain Royce, sir.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.012
Thank you for meeting
with us, Captain.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.317
I'm sure you're
very busy.

11:06.361 --> 11:09.538
And shocked, frankly.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.845
Uh, still keep thinking
we've made a mistake.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.151
And you've confirmed
that it was, uh,

11:14.195 --> 11:16.327
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar?

11:16.371 --> 11:19.548
Through a forensic analysis,
yes.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.071
There's a three-step
authentication

11:21.115 --> 11:22.943
process to log into our system.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.292
An access card,

11:24.335 --> 11:26.120
a 12-digit
randomized code

11:26.163 --> 11:29.601
sent to his personal device,
and facial rec.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.300
It was him, 100%,

11:32.343 --> 11:33.823
but I still
can't believe it.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.912
That master key that he stole,

11:35.956 --> 11:38.741
how many surveillance drones
does it control?

11:38.785 --> 11:41.396
Every one that's currently
in the air right now.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.659
Exact number
is classified, but

11:43.703 --> 11:45.487
it's a lot.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.315
And you can't just simply

11:47.358 --> 11:49.752
change the locks so the key
doesn't work anymore?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.362
Well, we're in the process
of doing that now,

11:51.406 --> 11:53.234
but it's not like
flipping a switch.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.323
It takes 36 hours
for a master key change

11:55.366 --> 11:56.933
to propagate across our system.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.806
- And until then?
- It's fully operational.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.633
What is the worst-case
scenario here?

12:01.677 --> 12:04.724
That's also not something
I'm authorized to discuss.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.768
Then who is?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
The Secretary of the Navy.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.730
This is my worst nightmare.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.383
Worse for the Navy
than when John Walker

12:12.427 --> 12:14.821
got in bed with the Soviets
in the '70s.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.562
We were cleaning up
his mess for decades.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.783
We cannot let history
repeat itself, Director.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.219
I couldn't agree more.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.091
We have a lead on the buyer?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.570
Only speculation.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.833
I need confirmation.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.748
I can't unleash
a counterattack

12:28.791 --> 12:30.880
unless we know
who we're aiming our guns at.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.753
What about the suspect? Nazar?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.319
We're still searching for him.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.713
I've spoken with
the attorney general.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.671
We are authorizing NCIS,

12:39.715 --> 12:42.326
under Title 18, 2332,

12:42.370 --> 12:44.154
to employ any legal

12:44.198 --> 12:46.853
means necessary
to apprehend Nazar.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.332
2332?

12:48.376 --> 12:49.856
You want troops in the streets?

12:49.899 --> 12:52.467
Whatever it takes to get Nazar.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.991
Is there something
the Navy's not telling us?

12:55.035 --> 12:56.993
I've just been informed

12:57.037 --> 13:00.127
that the master key controls
not only surveillance drones,

13:00.170 --> 13:02.129
but also combat drones.

13:02.172 --> 13:05.828
22 of those are already
flying as we speak.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.048
Nazar has the power
to launch an attack

13:08.091 --> 13:10.224
against the United States.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.495
A massive manhunt is underway

13:20.538 --> 13:21.975
for a decorated
Navy drone pilot,

13:22.018 --> 13:23.803
who's now
a murder suspect.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.457
Rafi Nazar,
last seen yesterday...

13:26.501 --> 13:28.242
Nice work
on the media blitz.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.505
His face is plastered
all over the news.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.028
He can't use
his cell phone

13:32.072 --> 13:33.725
or credit card without
triggering the alarm.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.553
He makes his first mistake,
we're gonna nail him.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.338
He made his first mistake.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.514
Nazar just called his fiancée.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.863
So he turned on
his phone?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.691
No, he called
from a burner phone,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.649
but we were able to get
a warrant on her line as well.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.304
- We have audio?
- Sending it to the plasma now.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.568
Hello?
Baby, it's me.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.918
Oh, my God, Rafi?

13:51.961 --> 13:53.658
Are you okay?
I'm safe, yes.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.746
Not for long.

13:54.790 --> 13:55.878
What is happening?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.184
They're saying you stole...

13:57.227 --> 13:58.402
Baby, do you trust me?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.361
No.
Yes.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.058
Yes, of course, always.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.930
Then you
know I-I didn't do this.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.714
But why are you running?

14:05.757 --> 14:06.933
You see the news?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.369
They've already
convicted me.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.588
I wanted to tell you
I'm going to Afghanistan.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.112
Are you serious?

14:12.155 --> 14:13.461
Rafi, why?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.679
Someone set me up,

14:14.723 --> 14:15.855
and I'm gonna
find out who.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.204
Starting with my uncle.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.640
Oh, God.

14:18.683 --> 14:19.946
Will you come with me?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.861
I can't believe
this is happening.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.169
Yes. Yes, I'll come with you.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.475
Get our passports

14:27.518 --> 14:28.563
and all the money
from the safe,

14:28.606 --> 14:29.520
then sneak out
of the house

14:29.564 --> 14:30.870
without being seen.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.959
Okay. Okay.
Where are we meeting?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.048
Our favorite restaurant.
One hour.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.049
I love you.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.441
I love you, too.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.139
We have a guy
watching Kay's house?

14:39.182 --> 14:40.183
Calling him now.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.489
Have him detain her

14:41.532 --> 14:42.794
until you and Torres get there.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.057
We need her to tell us

14:44.100 --> 14:45.406
the location
of that restaurant.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.581
What if she won't say?

14:46.624 --> 14:48.278
You're the hostage negotiator,

14:48.322 --> 14:50.280
make her say. McGee.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.108
Forensics. Let's do it.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.155
- Hey, Nick. Good cop, bad cop?
- Dibs on bad cop.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.070
Hey.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.202
Kasie.
Oh, hey.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.770
I was just buzzing you.
I know where Nazar is.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.685
- Did you trace the call?
- What call?

15:03.728 --> 15:05.034
Well, Nazar...

15:05.992 --> 15:07.732
Actually, never mind.
What do you got?

15:09.169 --> 15:10.692
We know he abandoned his car

15:10.735 --> 15:12.172
in a parking lot
in Richmond.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.696
From there, I scoured
surveillance and security

15:14.739 --> 15:15.915
footage to track him.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.960
That's him
in the blue hat.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.006
He traveled five blocks
from the parking lot

15:20.049 --> 15:21.877
to an AmeriTrain station.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.966
He paid cash
to buy a ticket

15:24.010 --> 15:25.707
on the Northwest Regional Line.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.838
He's still on the train?

15:26.882 --> 15:28.579
No. He got off at Union Station.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.754
Back in D.C.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.669
He left the station,

15:31.713 --> 15:33.976
turned northwest
on Massachusetts Avenue.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.673
That's all the shots
I have so far,

15:35.717 --> 15:38.067
and according to the timestamp,
that was...

15:38.111 --> 15:39.329
14 minutes ago.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.504
Restaurant must be downtown.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.636
That's where
we're going, too.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.599
It's Torres and Knight.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.343
Why is this guy holding me
prisoner in my own house?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.867
Were you going
somewhere? Hmm?

15:55.911 --> 15:57.869
Maybe to meet Rafi
at your favorite restaurant?

15:57.913 --> 16:00.742
So you were listening.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.005
But that means you heard Rafi
say that he's innocent.

16:03.049 --> 16:06.269
He's not gonna confess. He knew
we had your phone tapped.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.707
What is that?

16:09.751 --> 16:11.187
Hmm?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.496
Let's take a look.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.587
Two passports.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286
About, what?

16:23.330 --> 16:24.853
600 bucks.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.986
Agent Torres.
You're packing
kind of light...

16:32.469 --> 16:34.471
...considering you're
moving to Afghanistan.

16:34.515 --> 16:37.779
Agent Torres, will you please
wait in the car with Leigh?

16:48.485 --> 16:51.097
You know,
Agent Torres is a...

16:51.140 --> 16:54.187
a good agent, but he just
doesn't understand love.

16:55.971 --> 16:59.192
How it can make you
do crazy things.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.543
Yesterday, you were
planning your wedding.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.328
Today, you're...

17:05.372 --> 17:08.505
running away with a man
the Navy is saying is a traitor.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.727
Your head must be spinning.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.077
It's like a nightmare
I can't wake up from.

17:23.651 --> 17:26.393
If you go to Afghanistan,

17:26.436 --> 17:28.830
your nightmare
is just beginning.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.051
You will be the target
of an international manhunt,

17:32.094 --> 17:34.183
and we won't be able
to help you.

17:34.227 --> 17:37.839
Or you could help us.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.494
If Rafi truly is
the victim of some

17:40.537 --> 17:43.584
huge misunderstanding, you could
put all of this behind you

17:43.627 --> 17:45.151
and go back
to your lives,

17:45.194 --> 17:47.979
here in the U.S.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.855
What do you want me to do?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.207
You're doing just fine, Kay.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
Have a seat if you can hear me.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.561
Torres, you in position?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.128
Sure. You and McGee
enjoy your lunch,

18:06.172 --> 18:08.435
while I write parking tickets.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.350
You know, people are looking
at me like I kicked their dog.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.700
They're not even
real tickets, people.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.920
I'll swap places with you
any time, Torres.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.271
Nah, I'm good.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.447
Nazar's late.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.579
He'll be here.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.538
So, you want to hear
a cool story?

18:24.581 --> 18:26.366
Well, I guess
if we're not chatting,

18:26.409 --> 18:28.368
we're looking like
a couple of statues,

18:28.411 --> 18:29.760
so, yeah, story time.
Let's do it.

18:31.936 --> 18:35.940
So, Jimmy Palmer
got a random $10,000

18:35.984 --> 18:37.551
deposited into
his bank account,

18:37.594 --> 18:40.119
and he doesn't know from who.
It's crazy, right?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.294
No.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.860
Not crazy?

18:42.904 --> 18:45.167
No. I mean, well, yeah,
it is crazy, but...

18:45.211 --> 18:46.995
I think you're actually
getting confused

18:47.038 --> 18:48.779
'cause it happened to me,
not-not Jimmy.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.607
Uh...

18:50.651 --> 18:54.263
No, pretty sure it was Jimmy,
unless you work in autopsy,

18:54.307 --> 18:56.439
wear scrubs, and have
cute little dimples.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.184
Wait. You got a mystery $10,000

19:02.228 --> 19:04.578
put into your
- bank account, too?
- Yes.

19:04.621 --> 19:05.622
What?

19:07.494 --> 19:08.712
Are you checking your account?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.149
Yeah.
Good.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.715
Got him. Pharmacy.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.980
All right, hold positions.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.292
Oh, he looks so scared.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.555
Wave back at him, Kay.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.862
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can do this.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.606
Yes, you can.
You got this.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.828
I'm sorry. I can't.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.395
All right, move in, now.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.791
Rafi, it's a trap!

19:45.227 --> 19:46.359
Run!

20:00.286 --> 20:01.765
Nick, there he is.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.072
Nazar!

20:04.115 --> 20:06.553
Watch out!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.339
Hey, are you okay?

20:10.383 --> 20:11.427
Oh, my gosh!

20:17.520 --> 20:19.479
He's in the alley.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.876
NCIS.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.052
Show yourself, Nazar.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.403
McGee! Knight!

20:30.446 --> 20:32.535
- Clear on this side.
- You got him?

20:33.623 --> 20:35.364
What, you don't have him?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.583
No. He didn't pass you?

20:36.626 --> 20:37.801
No. He has to be here.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.194
Well, obviously,
he's not.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.152
We lost him.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.991
Trying to figure out
how he got away?

20:55.515 --> 20:57.038
I should've
had him.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.910
Don't beat yourself up.
It's not your fault.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.478
I know it's not my...
Wait, you think it's my fault?

21:02.522 --> 21:04.306
I said it's not your fault.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.222
Yeah, but you said it like
everyone thinks it's my fault.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.659
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
it's my fault.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.313
I was the one who
couldn't get Kay Barlow

21:11.357 --> 21:12.967
to just stand there and wave.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.535
It's definitely
- Kay's fault, yeah.
- It's her fault.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.667
What is she doing
in interrogation?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.626
Cooling her heels.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.019
She knows she's in trouble,
she just doesn't care.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.195
All right,
let's see what we got.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.937
Nazar's last known
location was here.

21:26.981 --> 21:30.724
McGee is asking MPD to establish
a perimeter one square mile

21:30.767 --> 21:33.683
from that spot. Entry and exit
points are sealed off.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.772
Every car, bus or train
coming out of the area

21:35.816 --> 21:37.339
gets searched-- so far, nothing.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.384
So he's still
in the perimeter.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.733
I want a hard-target search

21:39.776 --> 21:41.038
of every business,

21:41.082 --> 21:42.388
every warehouse,
every apartment

21:42.431 --> 21:44.346
until we find him,
and read my lips,

21:44.390 --> 21:46.696
we will find him.
All right, let's go.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.829
Wait, guys. I think
I know where he is.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.311
I have studied every building
in that perimeter,

21:52.354 --> 21:54.748
and, if I were him,
I know where I'd be hiding.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.447
4261 Hudson Avenue, Northwest.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.622
Great. Let's go get him.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.363
Easier said than done.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.669
Why?

22:04.932 --> 22:07.369
Because it is the
Embassy of Afghanistan.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.200
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Director Vance.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.594
- Nice to make your acquaintance.
- I'll get right to it.

22:14.637 --> 22:17.727
NCIS is hunting a fugitive
named Rafi Nazar.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.382
We have reason
to believe that... Say no more, Director.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.471
Mr. Nazar sought asylum here
an hour ago.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.127
Well, thank you
for your forthrightness.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.259
We can have a team there
in 20 minutes to pick him up.

22:28.303 --> 22:31.219
That won't be necessary.
We will not be giving him back.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.482
You're protecting
a killer.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.179
Mr. Ambassador,

22:35.223 --> 22:36.703
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar

22:36.746 --> 22:38.487
committed two

22:38.531 --> 22:40.141
murder and treason.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.534
Allegedly committed.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.144
It is the opinion
of the Afghan

22:43.187 --> 22:45.407
government that he is innocent
on both counts.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.017
And how did you arrive
at that opinion,

22:47.061 --> 22:49.150
considering that you haven't
reviewed the mountain

22:49.193 --> 22:50.891
of incriminating evidence
that we've gathered?

22:50.934 --> 22:53.546
Do you know how many
innocent Afghans

22:53.589 --> 22:55.983
are wrongly imprisoned
in Guantanamo Bay?

22:56.026 --> 22:58.028
Let's not get off the
subject. We are...

22:58.072 --> 22:59.421
We've made our decision.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
It is within our rights
to shield him,

23:01.467 --> 23:03.120
since he is a citizen
of Afghanistan.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.340
He's also a citizen
of the United States.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.733
Then treat him like one.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.996
Is he not innocent
until proven guilty?

23:09.039 --> 23:10.389
You really believe him,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.565
or are you
protecting him

23:12.608 --> 23:14.175
because someone
in your new government

23:14.218 --> 23:15.829
just bought the drone key?

23:15.872 --> 23:19.049
I will not be dignifying
that accusation with a reply.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.442
Good day, gentlemen.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.709
So, let me get this straight,

23:26.753 --> 23:28.537
a suspected traitor

23:28.581 --> 23:31.192
is conspiring with an
unstable foreign government

23:31.235 --> 23:33.368
in the middle
of Washington, D.C.,

23:33.412 --> 23:36.284
and there isn't anything
we can do about it.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.025
Yup, that about sums it up.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.809
Then you're not gonna like
what I'm about to tell you.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.420
Wait, you have
something?

23:41.463 --> 23:43.117
Yeah. Why do you think
I called you down here?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.206
I thought you wanted
to wallow in our sadness.

23:45.249 --> 23:48.949
No, but prepare
for more sadness.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.560
According to Internet chatter,

23:51.604 --> 23:54.215
the drone key
has just been sold.

23:54.258 --> 23:57.523
- To who?
- Doesn't mention the buyer, just the price.

23:58.611 --> 24:01.483
Free.
What? Free?

24:01.527 --> 24:04.138
That tech is worth
tens of millions.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.706
Unless they were stealing it
for a cause, and not for money.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.621
A cause like arming the Taliban?

24:08.664 --> 24:11.145
Yeah. The key's active
for another seven hours.

24:11.188 --> 24:14.148
Can you remind me why we're not
just storming the embassy?

24:14.191 --> 24:16.193
- Are you seriously asking that?
- No.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.196
Yeah, okay, maybe, yeah.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.981
It's sovereign Afghan territory.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.809
Breaching those walls
is a declaration of war.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.464
Afghanistan having control
of our drones,

24:25.507 --> 24:26.943
that's a declaration of war.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.510
If they have the key,
doesn't necessarily mean

24:28.554 --> 24:29.903
that they're gonna bomb us.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
They may just steal
the technology.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.210
Oh, well, Tim, that makes me
feel so much better.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.690
We can still stop this.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.475
Uh, no, we can't.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.999
All we have to do is lure Nazar
out of the embassy

24:39.042 --> 24:40.740
before he hands over
the drone key.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.045
How do we do that?

24:42.089 --> 24:43.220
Leverage.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.961
We have no cards to play.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.877
We have one card left.
She's sitting in interrogation.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.271
We played that card,
and it was a losing hand.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.621
She was willing to give up
her freedom for him,

24:52.665 --> 24:55.276
maybe he's willing to do
the same for her.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.019
Welcome to the Embassy <i>
of Afghanistan.</i>

24:59.062 --> 25:00.934
Please check
your firearm here.

25:03.066 --> 25:06.940
Hey, quick question. When, uh,
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar

25:06.983 --> 25:09.725
arrived, did he check in
a nine millimeter?

25:10.857 --> 25:12.598
Sign here.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.425
Because that weapon
may have been used

25:14.469 --> 25:17.516
in the commission of a murder.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.217
This way, please.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.528
Special Agent Parker.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.965
Thank you, Ambassador.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.796
Well...

25:36.839 --> 25:39.276
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar,

25:39.320 --> 25:40.887
good to finally meet you.

25:40.930 --> 25:44.151
I've advised Mr. Nazar
to remain silent.

25:44.194 --> 25:47.284
This meeting is a courtesy
to your Secretary of the Navy.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.895
It's not an interrogation.

25:48.938 --> 25:51.854
I understand the ground rules,

25:51.898 --> 25:54.117
but I'm not here
to talk about Mr. Nazar.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.511
I'm here to discuss Kay Barlow.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.470
NCIS has charged her
with aiding and abetting,

25:59.514 --> 26:00.776
obstruction of justice,

26:00.820 --> 26:02.343
and accessory after the fact.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.650
Those three felonies,
served consecutively,

26:04.693 --> 26:07.348
carry a sentence of 27 years.

26:07.391 --> 26:10.612
That is a totally preposterous
sentence for her actions.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.353
I agree, you've got

26:12.396 --> 26:16.096
a fiancée caught up
in tragic circumstances.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.185
My bet is that
any jury

26:18.228 --> 26:20.579
will give her the maximum.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.242
I told you this meeting was
going to be a dog and pony show.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.114
Your fiancée
will be available

26:34.157 --> 26:36.638
to walk down the aisle
when she's 56.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.335
Have a nice flight to Kabul.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.207
Wait.
Rafi, please.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.600
No. I want to speak.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.472
I did not steal
that drone key.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.778
Navy says you did.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.301
They're wrong.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.695
Well, if you're innocent,
why are you hiding here?

26:49.738 --> 26:52.436
Kay doesn't deserve
to be caught up in this.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.873
That we both agree on.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.657
What she did,

26:55.701 --> 26:57.354
she was only trying
to protect me.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.748
Yeah, well, love's a bitch.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.056
If I turn myself in... Mr. Nazar.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.884
Ambassador, enough.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.279
If I turn myself in...

27:11.194 --> 27:13.066
...will you drop the charges
against her?

27:13.109 --> 27:16.243
If you come with me now,

27:16.286 --> 27:18.375
you can watch us
take her cuffs off.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.522
Hi.
Hi.

27:34.565 --> 27:37.786
Can I ask a favor?

27:37.830 --> 27:39.048
Go ahead.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.571
I love you.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.660
Are you okay?

27:41.703 --> 27:43.183
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Okay.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.361
Good work.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.842
Thank you. Nice plan.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.408
Thank you.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.019
You know I didn't
do this.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.803
All right.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.588
I love you, okay?

27:57.632 --> 27:59.634
I love you, too, Rafi.
It's gonna be okay.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.157
Let's go.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.812
Rafi Nazar, you have
the right to remain silent.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.988
Anything you say
can and will be used...

28:08.817 --> 28:11.037
- Are you hit?
- No. Who is shooting at us?

28:11.080 --> 28:12.038
Parker!

28:12.081 --> 28:14.518
- You okay?
- Call 911!

28:15.650 --> 28:17.347
Nazar's been hit.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.403
How's the wound?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.231
I can't examine it
until I stop the bleeding.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.754
Can I help?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.582
You want to hold or cut?

28:34.625 --> 28:36.149
I'll hold.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.846
Use gloves and fresh gauze.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.811
You do this for all
your murder suspects?

28:45.854 --> 28:47.856
No, just the ones
with information

28:47.900 --> 28:50.598
vital to the security
of the United States.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.865
Well, that bleeding's
really slowing down.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.911
The bullet appears to
have missed his carotid.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.000
Lucky guy. He's gonna make it.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.654
Reroute us to NCIS.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.222
There's a doctor on staff

29:06.266 --> 29:08.094
that'll cross all the t's
and dot all the i's.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.749
Then you can ask for a transfer
when we get to the hospital.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.924
Listen, Miss...

29:11.967 --> 29:12.968
- Santiago.
- Santiago.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.317
We don't have time.

29:14.361 --> 29:15.884
What this man knows
is too important.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.756
I'm sorry, but
procedure states...
I'll go.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.805
I want to clear my name.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.328
Please.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.026
Take me to NCIS.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.506
What kind of doctor
do you have on staff?

29:29.550 --> 29:32.466
The kind that's
never lost a patient.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.819
Autopsy is prepped

29:37.863 --> 29:39.952
and good to go. I just want
to go on the record and say

29:39.995 --> 29:42.345
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.652
Dude, it's all good.
You're gonna be fine.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.088
Gunshot victims
that are still alive

29:46.132 --> 29:48.003
belong in a hospital,
not a morgue.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.832
Okay, Parker said the EMT
stopped the bleeding,

29:50.876 --> 29:52.747
right, and stabilized him,

29:52.791 --> 29:54.401
so the hard partis over.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.446
- What about the bullet?
- What about it?

29:56.490 --> 29:59.623
Is it still lodged
- inside of his body?
- I didn't ask.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.060
You didn't...
Okay...

30:04.063 --> 30:06.282
Speaking of surprises...

30:07.762 --> 30:09.416
You and McGee. $10,000.

30:09.459 --> 30:10.721
- What?
- Yeah.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.506
It's pretty crazy.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.986
You know what's crazy? I keep
checking my bank account.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.162
Three times. Zippo.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.033
Sorry, man.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.339
No, don't be sorry.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.167
Just means that,
uh, you're buying

30:21.210 --> 30:23.343
the next 30 times
that we go out.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.823
No can do.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.955
Put all the money
into an account for Victoria.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.131
What? What's she
gonna do with $10,000?

30:29.175 --> 30:30.524
She's a kid.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.700
The money was earmarked
for her, not for me.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.398
Yeah, the bank still won't
tell me who deposited it.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.357
Here we go.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.190
All right, Doc. Showtime.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.282
Our doctor was able
to remove the bullet,

30:49.325 --> 30:51.588
and he expects Rafi to
make a full recovery.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.155
Oh, thank God.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.896
But who shot him?

30:54.940 --> 30:56.158
We don't know.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.638
We're still interviewing
witnesses.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.466
But you must have a theory.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.816
The most obvious suspect is
whoever bought the drone key.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.296
The last thing they would want

31:03.339 --> 31:05.167
is for Nazar to reveal
their identity.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.432
But that means Rafi did it.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.131
He really stole the key.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.576
Kay...

31:22.619 --> 31:24.883
it's understandable you
didn't believe he was guilty.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.798
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying because...

31:29.975 --> 31:32.325
...I still love him.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.763
Well, you've seen him,
and he is still alive.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.814
Kay, we have to go now.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.734
You got to believe me,
I did not steal the key.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.040
I'm being framed.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.650
Well, it's working.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.175
It sure looks like
you're committing espionage.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.306
No.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.178
When I enlisted,
I swore a pledge

32:00.657 --> 32:03.138
I, Rafi Nazar,
do solemnly affirm

32:03.182 --> 32:05.793
that I will support and defend
the Constitution

32:05.836 --> 32:08.622
of the United States
against all enemies,

32:08.665 --> 32:11.059
foreign and domestic.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.540
Which enemy are you,
foreign or domestic?

32:13.583 --> 32:16.108
See, this right here,
this is why I ran.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.980
I love my country-- but it
doesn't seem to love me anymore.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.548
I knew I'd be presumed guilty
because of my heritage.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.551
Wrong. You're presumed guilty
because of the evidence.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.118
What evidence?

32:26.161 --> 32:28.859
That drone key was downloaded
and stolen by someone

32:28.903 --> 32:32.820
with your access card,
your phone and your face.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.996
It was not me.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.216
Technically, you're right.
No, it was Andre Kopaloff.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.696
- Who?
- The hacker you hired.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.003
Then you thanked him
by shooting him to death

32:42.047 --> 32:43.744
with your nine millimeter.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.746
Run ballistics against my gun.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.966
Conveniently,
your weapon is missing.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.318
It's-it's not...
it's not in the case?

32:53.319 --> 32:54.711
Nope.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.585
Something you want to share?

32:58.628 --> 33:01.805
Does facial rec work
when your eyes are closed?

33:08.769 --> 33:10.205
What am I doing here?

33:16.690 --> 33:19.040
You are being
interrogated

33:19.084 --> 33:20.737
on suspicion of murder

33:20.781 --> 33:21.782
and treason.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.958
What?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.742
Why?

33:25.786 --> 33:28.006
Your fiancé turned you in.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.834
I still can't
believe it.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.749
You did the right thing.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.404
You hired the hacker,

33:35.448 --> 33:37.493
and then you stole Rafi's
phone and access card

33:37.537 --> 33:39.234
in the middle
of the night.
No.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.019
You already knew his password,

33:41.062 --> 33:44.326
and facial rec still works
even if the face is asleep.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.763
N-No. Why is this happening?

33:46.807 --> 33:48.939
After Kopaloff helped you
steal the key...

33:50.115 --> 33:51.942
...you killed him
with Nazar's weapon.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.596
Which we found, by the way.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.337
Hidden under a floor mat
in your car,

33:55.381 --> 33:57.296
wrapped in newspaper.

33:57.339 --> 33:58.906
- Rafi must have planted it there.
- It was

33:58.949 --> 34:00.908
today's newspaper, and
Rafi hasn't been back

34:00.951 --> 34:02.388
to your house
since yesterday.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.568
We dug through some
of your old social media posts.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.265
Here's a good one.

34:11.310 --> 34:14.313
"America needs
a bloody insurgence."

34:16.271 --> 34:18.447
Did you think you deleted that?

34:18.491 --> 34:20.928
Delete doesn't
really mean delete

34:20.971 --> 34:22.277
on the Internet.

34:22.321 --> 34:25.367
You have been very
careful recently,

34:25.411 --> 34:27.935
but five years ago,
your posts were, uh,

34:27.978 --> 34:30.068
shall we say, radical?

34:32.244 --> 34:36.161
"Join the Holy Wars
against the enemies of Islam."

34:36.204 --> 34:39.512
Is that what you think jihad is?

34:47.302 --> 34:51.393
Sometimes war is necessary
to wake up the infidels.

34:51.437 --> 34:53.830
That was another one
of your posts.

34:54.962 --> 34:57.356
Is that who you sold
the drone key to?

34:59.009 --> 35:00.489
The Taliban?

35:00.533 --> 35:02.622
I didn't sell it.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.494
I gave it away.

35:05.538 --> 35:09.672
A heroic sacrifice
for the cause.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.892
Kay.

35:11.935 --> 35:15.200
You should educate yourself
properly.

35:15.243 --> 35:21.119
Jihad is the internal struggle
of Muslims to do good.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.164
Not evil.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.601
What I did isn't evil.

35:25.645 --> 35:28.300
It's divine retribution.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.694
And you will witness it.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.087
Soon.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.394
- You want to tell her?
- Nah. You tell her.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.091
Okay.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.747
So, it turns out, Kay,
that about ten minutes ago,

35:40.790 --> 35:44.707
the Navy was able to deactivate
the drone key.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.537
It's useless.

35:50.496 --> 35:52.454
Now, that...

35:52.498 --> 35:54.674
is divine retribution.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.597
Well, Kay Barlow was right
about one thing--

36:04.640 --> 36:07.556
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar
was innocent.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.819
She orchestrated the
whole thing from day one.

36:09.863 --> 36:13.606
She dated him not for love
but for his top secret access.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.348
She specifically targeted
him for his birthplace.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.088
And she knew
that cultural stereotypes

36:18.132 --> 36:20.439
would make it easy to believe
that he was a traitor.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.005
So, who radicalized her?

36:22.049 --> 36:25.052
Well, meet Lance Johnson
of West Virginia.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.794
He was already on our
domestic terrorist watchlist

36:27.837 --> 36:29.274
due to his extremist
teachings.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.363
They met online.
We found hundreds of his texts

36:31.406 --> 36:32.929
on her phone, including one

36:32.973 --> 36:35.018
where she orders
him to kill Nazar

36:35.062 --> 36:36.585
before he could talk to NCIS.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.021
We picked him up an hour ago

36:38.065 --> 36:39.458
and charged him
with attempted murder.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.199
Well, we should tell
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.375
I already called him
so we could tell him in person.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.377
Good work, gentlemen.

36:46.378 --> 36:48.118
Agent McGee,

36:48.162 --> 36:49.685
would you mind staying
for a moment?

36:51.296 --> 36:52.601
Sure.

36:54.864 --> 36:58.303
Yes, Dr. Palmer. Will you
please join me in my office?

37:10.924 --> 37:13.274
Chief Warrant Officer Nazar,
thank you for coming.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.364
We have arrested
the man who tried to kill you.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.670
Thank you.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.585
Thank you for believing in me.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.282
Wish we did from the beginning.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.849
I shouldn't have run
that morning.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.981
But when I got a call
from one of my pilots

37:25.025 --> 37:27.245
tipping me off about the raid,

37:27.288 --> 37:29.029
I just panicked.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.814
Thank you for your
recommendation to SECNAV, sir.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.555
I've been reinstated
to active duty.

37:33.599 --> 37:36.166
You were wronged-- it's our job
to make things right.

37:36.210 --> 37:39.692
I wish that's how it worked
in the real world.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.737
Doesn't matter
that I've been cleared--

37:41.781 --> 37:43.739
I still get looks
from my neighbors.

37:43.783 --> 37:46.568
Listen, man, um...

37:46.612 --> 37:48.483
I know how rough it is.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.007
Your name's different,
you look different,

37:51.051 --> 37:55.316
and somehow people think they
have the license to judge you.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.756
But that's not all, is it?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.196
You're worried
about your team?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.198
We were all family

38:08.242 --> 38:09.374
before this
happened.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.332
I wouldn't worry
about that.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.856
Your fellow pilots
and C.O.,

38:13.900 --> 38:16.250
they believed you were innocent.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.817
They're still your family.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.343
Just trust
they're gonna stand up for you.

38:28.567 --> 38:29.959
Director, you
wanted to...

38:30.003 --> 38:32.092
Oh. Hey, McGee.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.050
What's, uh, what's going on?

38:34.094 --> 38:36.749
So, you don't know
why you're here?

38:36.792 --> 38:41.231
I'm thinking it has something to
do with those $10,000 deposits.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.755
Mm-hmm.

38:42.798 --> 38:43.930
You know about that?

38:43.973 --> 38:45.366
I do.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.934
- Are we in trouble?
- No.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.458
I just wanted to welcome you
as the newest members

38:50.502 --> 38:55.376
of the Leroy Jethro Gibbs
College Scholarship Club.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.857
That money is
from Gibbs?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.859
That's right.
That's amazing,

38:59.902 --> 39:01.382
but, I mean,
it's way too generous.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.950
Agreed.
No, we can't possibly keep it.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.821
Well, you can't give it back.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.562
I should know. I tried.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.129
He donated to you, too?

39:09.172 --> 39:10.739
Yep, years ago,

39:10.783 --> 39:13.220
when my kids were the same age
as yours are now.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.918
Director,
why would Gibbs do this?

39:16.963 --> 39:19.618
It's in memory
of his daughter, Kelly.

39:19.661 --> 39:22.229
When she was young,
he started a college fund.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.928
When she died,
Gibbs never closed the account.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.191
In fact,
he kept adding to it.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.846
So since then, he's helped
a lot of agents' families.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.414
Kids all going to college
in Kelly's honor.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.416
What a legacy, huh?

39:35.460 --> 39:36.896
I don't know what to say.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.419
Just say thank you.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.290
I definitely will.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.554
I just really wish that I
could thank him in person.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.383
Well, hopefully,
one day you will.
