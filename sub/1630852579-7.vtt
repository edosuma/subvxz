00:02.652 --> 00:03.651
NARRATOR:
A detailed description

00:03.671 --> 00:06.230
of a highly advanced
aircraft appears

00:06.248 --> 00:09.399
in a 3,000-year-old text.

00:09.493 --> 00:10.492
JONATHAN YOUNG:
There are tales

00:10.511 --> 00:11.677
of flying craft

00:11.828 --> 00:14.238
that could fly
at extraordinary speeds

00:14.331 --> 00:16.664
that defy the laws of physics.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.409
NARRATOR:
Ancient stories depict a vehicle

00:19.428 --> 00:23.188
that travels both
in the sky and underwater.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.858
WILLIAM HENRY: In Sumeria
and in Babylon, they talked about

00:26.085 --> 00:30.696
Oannes who emerged
from the sea in a winged disc.

00:30.923 --> 00:33.532
NARRATOR: And the
oldest Egyptian hieroglyphs

00:33.759 --> 00:36.702
reference strange objects
descending to Earth.

00:36.929 --> 00:40.188
We have depictions
in ancient times

00:40.282 --> 00:42.708
of flying craft that seem to be

00:42.859 --> 00:44.877
in the form of pyramids.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.546
NARRATOR:
Now, military personnel

00:47.697 --> 00:49.214
are capturing footage

00:49.441 --> 00:51.792
of nearly identical
objects in the sky.

00:51.886 --> 00:55.445
Are we encountering
the same extraterrestrials

00:55.464 --> 00:59.558
that have occupied Earth
for thousands of years?

01:00.786 --> 01:02.561
♪ ♪

01:04.123 --> 01:05.731
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:05.882 --> 01:08.567
in the universe.

01:08.718 --> 01:12.813
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:12.965 --> 01:15.557
It demands
we question everything

01:15.651 --> 01:18.059
we have ever been taught.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.396
The evidence is all around us.

01:21.415 --> 01:25.309
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:25.327 --> 01:28.236
We are not alone.

01:28.330 --> 01:31.090
We have never been alone.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.510
NARRATOR:
July 2019.

01:43.662 --> 01:47.106
San Clemente Island, California.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.442
68 nautical miles west
of San Diego.

01:50.594 --> 01:53.595
Nine U.S. warships

01:53.614 --> 01:55.614
belonging to an elite
Navy unit called

01:55.765 --> 01:57.616
Carrier Strike Group 9

01:57.767 --> 02:00.119
are performing nighttime
training exercises

02:00.270 --> 02:02.121
in restricted waters.

02:02.272 --> 02:05.532
The Navy was undertaking
an exercise

02:05.684 --> 02:07.775
with Strike Force 9.

02:07.870 --> 02:11.188
This is an integrated crew

02:11.281 --> 02:13.114
centered on an aircraft carrier,

02:13.208 --> 02:15.450
but with multiple other

02:15.544 --> 02:17.861
U.S. Navy vessels,

02:17.954 --> 02:21.381
and jets really testing how

02:21.533 --> 02:24.368
the U.S. military would respond

02:24.386 --> 02:26.478
in a war-fighting situation,

02:26.630 --> 02:29.222
so everything
has to be seamless.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.390
And then,

02:30.542 --> 02:33.377
into the middle of all of this,

02:33.395 --> 02:36.546
suddenly and unexpectedly,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.882
the exercise is interrupted

02:38.901 --> 02:41.160
by an unknown presence.

02:43.146 --> 02:44.479
NARRATOR:
The ships are swarmed

02:44.498 --> 02:47.315
by what the Navy
refers to as UAVs,

02:47.334 --> 02:50.652
or Unidentified Aerial Vehicles.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.988
The UAVs fly for prolonged
periods of time

02:54.008 --> 02:56.249
in low-visibility conditions,

02:56.343 --> 02:59.160
performing brazen maneuvers
over the warships

02:59.180 --> 03:01.996
near a sensitive
military training range.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.590
Make no mistake about it,

03:03.684 --> 03:08.002
something is penetrating

03:08.022 --> 03:10.856
the sophisticated
air defense network.

03:11.007 --> 03:13.917
JEREMY CORBELL:
That swarm series

03:13.936 --> 03:16.695
of UFOs around Navy ships

03:16.846 --> 03:19.013
is one of the most important
bodies of evidence

03:19.033 --> 03:21.516
ever documented
and put out to the public

03:21.535 --> 03:24.519
because it involved
so many ships.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.264
There were
a strategic coordination

03:27.282 --> 03:28.707
of these unidentifieds.

03:30.527 --> 03:32.452
NARRATOR:
The Photographic Interpretation

03:32.604 --> 03:35.956
and Examination team
aboard the USS<i> Russell</i>

03:36.050 --> 03:39.534
captured a compelling
18-second night vision video

03:39.628 --> 03:44.798
of multiple UAVs hovering
just 700 feet above the ship.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.226
CORBELL: The USS<i>
Russell</i> was swarmed by UFOs

03:47.453 --> 03:50.044
like other ships,
but this was different.

03:50.138 --> 03:52.973
These were flying pyramids

03:53.125 --> 03:55.308
without any
control surfaces, wings,

03:55.402 --> 03:58.237
rudders, tails, plumes,
or exhaust. Nothing.

03:58.388 --> 04:00.297
How did these things move?

04:00.390 --> 04:02.407
How were they able to get past

04:02.634 --> 04:04.968
one of our nation's
greatest defense systems?

04:04.987 --> 04:07.246
This was something that
we couldn't even defend against.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.566
NARRATOR:
In December 2017,

04:11.585 --> 04:14.569
just 18 months prior
to this incident,

04:14.588 --> 04:17.163
<i>The New York Times</i>
exposed the U.S. government's

04:17.316 --> 04:21.260
secret program to investigate
unidentified aerial phenomena.

04:23.155 --> 04:25.597
Since that bombshell revelation,

04:25.824 --> 04:28.267
numerous photographs
and videos have surfaced

04:28.494 --> 04:31.937
of Navy encounters
with different types of UAPs.

04:32.164 --> 04:34.681
And as far as
ancient astronaut theorists

04:34.833 --> 04:37.258
are concerned,
the video captured

04:37.352 --> 04:41.855
from the USS<i> Russell</i> may be
the most extraordinary of all.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.450
Not because there were
so many objects seen in the sky,

04:45.602 --> 04:49.246
but because of the UAP's
very unique shape.

04:51.033 --> 04:54.275
TSOUKALOS: The fact that there
are pyramid-shaped objects

04:54.295 --> 04:56.703
that have been filmed
by the Navy

04:56.855 --> 04:59.447
is beyond interesting to me

04:59.466 --> 05:03.193
because we have
similar depictions

05:03.286 --> 05:06.638
in ancient times of flying craft

05:06.865 --> 05:09.308
that seem to be
in the form of pyramids.

05:09.535 --> 05:12.460
Clearly, what we see
in this footage of today

05:12.479 --> 05:14.554
is pyramid-shaped,
three-dimensionally.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.373
It's not flat.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.966
It's a three-dimensional pyramid

05:19.061 --> 05:20.968
floating in the sky.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.988
Providing that
the footage is real,

05:23.139 --> 05:25.065
providing it is
extraterrestrial,

05:25.217 --> 05:28.493
then one could argue
that the same visitors

05:28.645 --> 05:30.144
that we've had back then

05:30.164 --> 05:32.164
are showing themselves again.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.986
NARRATOR: On display
in the Egyptian Museum

05:39.081 --> 05:40.580
and Royal Mummies' Hall

05:40.674 --> 05:44.343
is an artifact from
the pyramid of Amenemhat III,

05:44.494 --> 05:48.088
called a Benben stone.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.683
In ancient Egypt, similar
pyramid-shaped capstones

05:51.835 --> 05:55.579
were placed on the top of giant
standing stones called obelisks.

05:55.672 --> 05:58.582
The first of these Benben stones

05:58.675 --> 06:01.342
predate the earliest pyramids.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.420
The obelisk pointed up
toward the heavens,

06:03.513 --> 06:05.364
so it is an object of worship,

06:05.591 --> 06:08.867
and that capstone,
that Benben stone,

06:09.018 --> 06:10.093
was the meeting place.

06:10.112 --> 06:13.187
That was the portal
to other worlds

06:13.281 --> 06:17.617
where human energy lifted up
and made contact with the gods.

06:17.769 --> 06:20.103
HUGH NEWMAN:
The shape of the Benben stone

06:20.196 --> 06:22.196
is like a classic pyramid shape.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.608
And, uh, you know, apparently,
the design of pyramids

06:24.701 --> 06:27.052
was based on
the Benben stone itself,

06:27.279 --> 06:29.554
and these are like
giant versions of it.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.541
DAVID CHILDRESS: The Benben
stone was not just, uh,

06:33.560 --> 06:36.561
symbolizing a connection
to the heavens,

06:36.713 --> 06:41.358
it was actually memorializing
an extraterrestrial visitation.

06:42.903 --> 06:47.147
TSOUKALOS: In ancient
Egypt, it's chock-full of references

06:47.299 --> 06:49.724
of celestial beings
descending from the sky

06:49.743 --> 06:51.701
and imparting knowledge
to our ancestors.

06:53.563 --> 06:56.656
One of the origin stories says

06:56.808 --> 07:01.161
that a Benben stone
descended from the sky,

07:01.313 --> 07:04.589
out of which
the first creator gods emerged

07:04.741 --> 07:06.666
and started
Egyptian civilization.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.261
It was a flying craft.

07:11.323 --> 07:14.433
NARRATOR: Could the pyramidal
capstones found atop Egypt's obelisks,

07:14.584 --> 07:16.935
and even the pyramids
themselves,

07:17.086 --> 07:20.346
have been inspired by
an extraterrestrial visitation?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.441
And if so,

07:22.592 --> 07:25.502
is it possible
that similar alien craft

07:25.520 --> 07:28.447
were captured on video
above the USS<i> Russell?</i>

07:30.008 --> 07:32.934
What we're seeing
from the USS<i> Russell,</i>

07:32.953 --> 07:37.013
these kind of objects
flying around in the sky

07:37.032 --> 07:38.865
were an identical shape

07:38.959 --> 07:41.518
and there was multiple ones
witnessed and filmed.

07:41.611 --> 07:44.370
And so, is there a connection?

07:44.523 --> 07:46.965
Is this what was witnessed
from the USS<i> Russell?</i>

07:48.543 --> 07:51.194
CHILDRESS: It's a
fascinating idea that, perhaps,

07:51.213 --> 07:53.546
extraterrestrials first arrived

07:53.699 --> 07:58.218
in Egypt in these small,
pyramid-shaped craft,

07:58.370 --> 07:59.794
like we're seeing in this video.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.388
And, in fact, many of the UAPs

08:02.541 --> 08:04.724
that have been reported
in modern times

08:04.876 --> 08:07.060
and that we see in
the recent Navy videos

08:07.212 --> 08:10.046
are very reminiscent
of ancient accounts

08:10.139 --> 08:12.974
of strange objects in the sky,

08:13.068 --> 08:14.475
accounts that you can find

08:14.495 --> 08:17.621
in many ancient cultures
around the world.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.650
NARRATOR: Did people
living thousands of years ago

08:22.669 --> 08:25.078
encounter the very same
objects in the sky

08:25.230 --> 08:28.155
that appear in recent
videos and photographs

08:28.250 --> 08:30.342
taken by the U.S. Navy?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.904
And if so, could this indicate
that humans

08:34.923 --> 08:36.923
have been sharing planet Earth
with another race

08:37.017 --> 08:38.408
of intelligent beings

08:38.426 --> 08:41.077
since our earliest history?

08:41.096 --> 08:44.414
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

08:44.432 --> 08:46.858
and suggest further evidence

08:47.010 --> 08:49.085
can be found in India,

08:49.178 --> 08:51.846
within the pages
of one of the world's

08:51.865 --> 08:54.032
oldest texts.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.208
NARRATOR: The coast of Florida.
January 2015.

09:03.435 --> 09:06.953
The crew of a Navy
F-18 fighter jet

09:07.105 --> 09:09.939
fly into restricted air space
and encounter

09:09.958 --> 09:12.942
an airborne object
directly in their flight path.

09:12.961 --> 09:16.704
They aim their forward-looking
infrared camera at the object

09:16.798 --> 09:19.966
and capture it in flight.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.786
F-18s were chasing this thing,
and they couldn't catch it.

09:22.804 --> 09:25.379
The UAP is doing things

09:25.399 --> 09:28.049
that modern aerodynamic
vehicles can't do.

09:28.143 --> 09:31.403
NARRATOR: According to
the aviator's official report,

09:31.630 --> 09:34.297
the craft descended
from altitudes

09:34.316 --> 09:38.076
of 60,000 feet to 50 feet
in a matter of seconds,

09:38.303 --> 09:40.895
hovering for short periods
of time

09:40.914 --> 09:44.231
and departing
at high velocities.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.901
One of the impressive
aspects of it,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.587
is that it's moving
against the wind,

09:48.814 --> 09:50.380
and you can hear
the pilot say this.

09:59.991 --> 10:01.674
CORBELL: It doesn't
lose speed, and it rotates

10:01.827 --> 10:03.751
mechanically against the wind.

10:03.845 --> 10:06.253
This gimbal footage

10:06.273 --> 10:10.091
is one of the rare pieces
of physical evidence

10:10.110 --> 10:13.612
that is corroborated directly
by individuals who are

10:13.763 --> 10:15.855
out there on the East Coast
documenting these things.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.783
It is highly impressive.

10:20.937 --> 10:23.622
Now, modern-day aircraft
can yaw and pitch,

10:23.773 --> 10:25.457
and they can roll,

10:25.684 --> 10:28.184
but they can't simply
pitch straight up

10:28.203 --> 10:30.795
and continue to move forward
into the line of flight.

10:30.947 --> 10:32.088
This thing does that.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.541
It's moving extremely fast,

10:35.636 --> 10:38.285
and it's accelerating
much faster than the F-18s can.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.880
So that, in itself,

10:41.032 --> 10:43.433
is a feat that mankind
has yet to accomplish.

10:44.886 --> 10:47.312
CORBELL: We tried to
vet this for a long time.

10:47.463 --> 10:50.482
What's uncomfortable is that
we haven't figured it out.

10:50.709 --> 10:53.634
That we don't know
whose technology this is.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.971
If you can't identify someone
that's far more advanced

10:56.990 --> 10:59.658
than you technologically,
Houston, we have a problem.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.386
NARRATOR: Navy video
of the incredible encounter

11:03.479 --> 11:06.331
was made public
in December 2017,

11:06.558 --> 11:09.668
and the object
was dubbed "GIMBAL"

11:09.895 --> 11:14.172
due to its ability
to rotate on an axis.

11:14.399 --> 11:16.824
But for
ancient astronaut theorists,

11:16.843 --> 11:21.829
just as intriguing as the way
it moves is the object's shape.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.258
The craft itself
is an acorn-shaped craft.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.427
Immediately, that's reminiscent

11:27.521 --> 11:29.837
of the what the ancient
Indian text described as

11:29.856 --> 11:32.649
the vimana, which were
acorn-shaped craft.

11:34.510 --> 11:37.511
TSOUKALOS: In the<i> Mahabharata,</i>
and at many of the ancient Vedic texts,

11:37.531 --> 11:41.182
they speak about
the so-called vimanas.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.201
The vimanas were flying vehicles

11:43.428 --> 11:46.095
with which to reach
the celestial realm.

11:46.114 --> 11:49.857
NARRATOR: In the ancient
Sanskrit epics of India

11:49.876 --> 11:52.877
there are highly detailed
descriptions of the vimana,

11:53.029 --> 11:56.272
which carried the gods
and other important figures

11:56.291 --> 11:57.957
through the sky

11:58.109 --> 12:01.219
and sometimes to other planets.

12:01.370 --> 12:04.038
The acorn-shaped craft

12:04.057 --> 12:08.785
were even incorporated at the
very top of many Hindu temples,

12:08.878 --> 12:11.563
and some researchers believe

12:11.714 --> 12:14.399
they also inspired
similar Buddhist structures

12:14.550 --> 12:16.901
called stupa.

12:17.053 --> 12:20.387
TSOUKALOS: If we go to
Indonesia and look at Borobudur,

12:20.407 --> 12:23.466
where we have 194 stupas

12:23.559 --> 12:25.243
sitting in concentric circles,

12:25.394 --> 12:27.746
each stupa, in my opinion,

12:27.897 --> 12:30.749
represents a type
of flying craft.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.420
Because "stupa" actually means
"celestial chariot,"

12:35.647 --> 12:38.923
or a way with which to reach
the celestial realm.

12:39.150 --> 12:43.094
And they are in the shape
of the so-called vimanas.

12:44.914 --> 12:47.748
NARRATOR: Often, the vimana
were described as war machines,

12:47.768 --> 12:50.084
armed with incredible weapons.

12:50.178 --> 12:52.996
There are tales of flying craft

12:53.014 --> 12:54.922
that could defy gravity

12:55.016 --> 12:58.501
and fly at extraordinary speeds
that defy the laws of physics.

12:58.594 --> 13:01.780
These were military in usage,

13:02.007 --> 13:04.265
had powerful engines
and powerful weapons.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.526
In these battles,

13:06.678 --> 13:09.512
missiles would fire
that could wipe out cities.

13:09.531 --> 13:11.623
These were the earliest stories

13:11.774 --> 13:14.684
we have
of flying military craft.

13:14.777 --> 13:16.702
HENRY:
In the Indian text,

13:16.797 --> 13:20.857
the vimanas are the chariots
or craft of the gods.

13:20.875 --> 13:24.135
They were clearly
a method of transportation

13:24.362 --> 13:26.954
that could take the gods
from place to place,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.215
country to country,
or even to other planets.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.460
They're sometimes described
as bright clouds.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.130
Some of them
are seven stories tall.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.966
NARRATOR:
In 1895,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.653
Sanskrit scholar Shivkar Talpade

13:41.804 --> 13:44.989
decided to fashion an aircraft
based solely on information

13:45.216 --> 13:47.383
gleaned from the ancient
Indian writings

13:47.402 --> 13:49.828
about the vimana.

13:49.979 --> 13:52.238
While the story
is hotly disputed,

13:52.390 --> 13:54.223
he allegedly tested the craft

13:54.242 --> 13:56.668
in front of an audience
of thousands of people

13:56.819 --> 13:58.819
on a beach in Bombay.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.747
TAYLOR: The legend
has it that he flew for,

14:01.900 --> 14:04.342
like, 30 seconds at 1,500 feet.

14:04.493 --> 14:08.404
The Wright brothers only went
120 feet for 12 seconds.

14:08.423 --> 14:12.575
But even more exciting
is that this is technology

14:12.594 --> 14:14.686
based on a scripture written

14:14.913 --> 14:17.747
thousands of years before
mankind ever had the idea

14:17.840 --> 14:19.524
of heavier-than-air flight.

14:19.675 --> 14:21.359
How is this possible?

14:23.012 --> 14:25.012
NARRATOR:
According to the Hindu text,

14:25.031 --> 14:27.348
the crafts were mind-controlled,

14:27.367 --> 14:30.093
able to change direction
and pitch

14:30.111 --> 14:32.019
and travel at high speeds,

14:32.113 --> 14:36.190
defying our current knowledge
of aeronautical physics.

14:36.284 --> 14:39.118
What's really cool is that
these modern-day UFO videos

14:39.212 --> 14:41.621
show that these vehicles

14:41.773 --> 14:45.458
are capable
of ridiculous maneuvers.

14:45.610 --> 14:48.553
That they can accelerate
at the drop of a dime,

14:48.704 --> 14:52.965
or they can just stop
or change direction immediately

14:53.118 --> 14:54.559
at g-forces

14:54.710 --> 14:58.212
that we could not survive.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.400
In the<i> Vaimanika Shastra,</i> which
describes what these vimanas

15:02.551 --> 15:04.068
were capable of doing,

15:04.295 --> 15:07.146
the exact same
descriptions exist.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.983
The fact that we have
similar stories in ancient times

15:11.077 --> 15:14.728
illustrates to me
something similar has happened.

15:14.822 --> 15:18.750
NARRATOR: Could it be
that the ancient Sanskrit texts

15:18.977 --> 15:21.252
are describing
extraterrestrial vehicles

15:21.404 --> 15:23.813
even more advanced
than the U.S. military's

15:23.906 --> 15:26.332
most sophisticated fighter jets?

15:26.426 --> 15:30.411
And if so, are we seeing
the same alien technology

15:30.505 --> 15:32.822
on display in the recent videos

15:32.840 --> 15:35.082
released by
the United States Navy?

15:35.101 --> 15:38.844
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

15:38.997 --> 15:41.330
and suggest that this technology

15:41.424 --> 15:43.590
may also be depicted on the wall

15:43.685 --> 15:47.946
of an Egyptian temple that
dates back thousands of years.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.289
NARRATOR:
Dendera, Egypt.

15:59.775 --> 16:01.459
Roughly one and a half
miles southeast

16:01.610 --> 16:05.296
of this ancient city
lies the Temple of Hathor,

16:05.523 --> 16:08.282
one of the most impressive
and well-preserved

16:08.376 --> 16:11.377
archeological sites
in all of Egypt.

16:11.529 --> 16:15.698
Among the vast hieroglyphs that
cover the columns of the temple

16:15.717 --> 16:17.308
are numerous depictions

16:17.535 --> 16:19.811
of pharaohs standing
on mysterious ships

16:20.038 --> 16:22.814
and purportedly traveling
through the stars.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.891
HENRY:
At the Temple of Hathor,

16:25.986 --> 16:29.895
we see a remarkable depiction
of a resurrected pharaoh

16:29.990 --> 16:32.306
standing on what
the ancient Egyptians called

16:32.325 --> 16:34.325
the Ship of Eternity.

16:34.552 --> 16:38.329
This is a-a craft
that was created by Ptah,

16:38.481 --> 16:40.481
the ancient Egyptian
god of technology,

16:40.500 --> 16:44.243
who the Egyptians connected
with the star Sirius.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.986
In ancient Egypt, we learn of

16:46.006 --> 16:50.341
pharaohs, gods who travelled
the stars riding these craft.

16:50.493 --> 16:52.826
NARRATOR:
According to William Henry,

16:52.846 --> 16:54.570
who has spent decades studying

16:54.663 --> 16:57.089
the ancient
Egyptian iconography,

16:57.242 --> 17:00.000
an important detail found
in some of the depictions

17:00.020 --> 17:02.336
at Dendera and elsewhere

17:02.430 --> 17:05.982
is that the pharaoh is shown
within a circle or bubble.

17:07.935 --> 17:09.919
HENRY:
In another remarkable example,

17:09.937 --> 17:11.937
we see a Pharaoh
sitting on a throne

17:12.090 --> 17:14.440
with Isis and Nephthys

17:14.592 --> 17:16.183
on either side of him,

17:16.202 --> 17:20.687
and he's sitting in a blue
bubble or magic bubble.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.115
NARRATOR: The so-called
"magic bubble" imagery

17:23.209 --> 17:26.193
is found in artwork
throughout the ancient world.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.695
And some researchers speculate

17:28.790 --> 17:30.048
that the repeated connection

17:30.275 --> 17:32.533
between the bubble shape
and ascension

17:32.552 --> 17:34.886
may indicate that it represents

17:35.113 --> 17:38.964
a common experience
describing space travel.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.224
Throughout the ancient world,

17:40.451 --> 17:42.709
we find other
very compelling examples

17:42.729 --> 17:45.805
of beings
surrounded by a bubble.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.067
For example, in Tibet we find

17:49.294 --> 17:52.570
Padmasambhava who sits
on a lotus throne

17:52.721 --> 17:54.980
surrounded
by rainbow-colored light

17:55.075 --> 17:59.151
with a thin line symbolizing
some form of a bubble.

17:59.304 --> 18:02.305
When you see the earliest
examples of Jesus

18:02.398 --> 18:03.989
ascending into the heavens,

18:04.084 --> 18:07.919
he's sitting on a throne
surrounded by concentric rings

18:08.146 --> 18:10.646
that form a bubble
around his body.

18:10.665 --> 18:12.239
These are supposed to represent

18:12.258 --> 18:14.650
what the Book of Acts
says he ascended in

18:14.743 --> 18:16.761
and will return riding upon.

18:16.988 --> 18:20.080
TSOUKALOS:
There are countless paintings

18:20.174 --> 18:23.917
of saints and other
celestial beings

18:24.011 --> 18:26.495
that happen to be shown

18:26.514 --> 18:29.181
in some type of
an energetic bubble.

18:29.334 --> 18:32.110
What if people saw something

18:32.337 --> 18:36.021
that surpassed their
technological intellect,

18:36.116 --> 18:39.617
and thus drew it in that way?

18:39.768 --> 18:42.695
NARRATOR: Mainstream
historians interpret the bubble shape

18:42.847 --> 18:46.515
found in religious art as simply
symbols of divinity.

18:46.534 --> 18:51.629
But could the repetition of this
iconic imagery across traditions

18:51.856 --> 18:56.359
suggest it was something
our ancestors witnessed?

18:56.377 --> 19:00.304
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

19:00.531 --> 19:02.698
and believe further evidence
may be found

19:02.717 --> 19:06.960
by taking a closer look at the
recently released GIMBAL video

19:06.980 --> 19:10.731
captured by Navy jets in 2015.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.878
When aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

19:15.897 --> 19:17.971
examined the GIMBAL video,

19:17.991 --> 19:20.383
he noticed
a very curious anomaly:

19:20.476 --> 19:23.661
a halo of light
surrounding the craft.

19:26.073 --> 19:28.557
TAYLOR: After further analysis
of the video,

19:28.576 --> 19:32.653
what we can see is
there is a bubble region

19:32.672 --> 19:35.064
that sort of surrounds
this craft.

19:35.157 --> 19:37.249
This is something
that you don't see

19:37.343 --> 19:38.751
when you look through
the same instrument

19:38.903 --> 19:42.254
at, say, an F-18 or an F-22
or an F-35.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.925
Black is hot on their
forward-looking infrared camera.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.352
And if black is hot,
then white is cooler,

19:48.504 --> 19:51.080
so this is a colder region
around the vehicle.

19:51.098 --> 19:53.006
So, maybe

19:53.026 --> 19:55.918
this is a warp bubble

19:55.937 --> 19:58.512
or some sort of propellant-less
propulsion field

19:58.606 --> 20:00.256
that someone has discovered.

20:00.349 --> 20:02.516
NARRATOR:
The concept of a warp bubble

20:02.535 --> 20:05.036
was introduced in 1994

20:05.187 --> 20:07.763
by Mexican physicist
Miguel Alcubierre,

20:07.782 --> 20:09.615
as part of a hypothetical model

20:09.767 --> 20:12.025
for traveling faster
than the speed of light.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.104
MICHIO KAKU:
I once asked Miguel Alcubierre

20:15.122 --> 20:18.791
how he came up with the idea
of the Alcubierre drive.

20:18.943 --> 20:21.052
He told me that he was
watching<i> Star Trek.</i>

20:21.203 --> 20:24.037
And in Star Trek, they,
well, compress the space

20:24.057 --> 20:26.891
in front of them and expand
the space behind them

20:27.042 --> 20:29.635
and would rocket faster
than the speed of light.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.637
And then he said,
"Well, wait a minute.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.189
I think I can duplicate that."

20:35.126 --> 20:37.401
NARRATOR: In
Alcubierre's theoretical model,

20:37.628 --> 20:40.738
the warp drive vehicle is
surrounded by an energy bubble

20:40.889 --> 20:42.406
within space-time.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.575
KAKU: You need
energy to create a bubble,

20:44.727 --> 20:47.745
what's called a warp bubble,
surrounding your starship.

20:47.972 --> 20:50.248
Then you need what is called
negative energy

20:50.399 --> 20:53.066
to drive it faster
than the speed of light,

20:53.086 --> 20:56.328
while inside,
you feel almost nothing.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.071
HENRY:
When we look at the idea

20:58.091 --> 20:59.590
of a warp bubble

20:59.817 --> 21:01.592
that could surround
a spacecraft,

21:01.819 --> 21:04.262
in the video,
engineers are seeing

21:04.489 --> 21:07.265
exactly that principle
in action.

21:07.416 --> 21:10.326
As far as
ancient astronaut theorists

21:10.344 --> 21:13.178
are concerned,
warp bubble technology

21:13.273 --> 21:16.757
could be on display
not only in the GIMBAL video,

21:16.776 --> 21:20.836
but also in artwork
created centuries ago,

21:20.855 --> 21:23.005
like the pharaoh's blue bubble,

21:23.024 --> 21:25.858
the Tibetan lotus throne,

21:25.952 --> 21:28.677
the ascension of Christ,

21:28.771 --> 21:31.122
and countless other
sacred images

21:31.349 --> 21:34.517
that seemingly show
identical phenomena.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.460
TSOUKALOS:
So, you have to wonder,

21:36.612 --> 21:40.280
what is it that the artist
tried to depict here?

21:40.374 --> 21:43.042
It's just like
Arthur C. Clarke said,

21:43.194 --> 21:47.788
"Any advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

21:47.807 --> 21:50.366
HENRY:
These are powerful examples

21:50.384 --> 21:52.368
that are suggesting
ascended beings

21:52.386 --> 21:54.961
who traveled the stars
in magic bubbles

21:54.981 --> 21:57.039
that precisely matches

21:57.132 --> 22:00.151
the Alcubierre
warp bubble concept.

22:00.302 --> 22:03.321
TAYLOR: Could these
ancient drawings be showing us

22:03.472 --> 22:05.990
the same thing
that we're seeing today

22:06.141 --> 22:07.992
in these modern-day
infrared cameras?

22:11.055 --> 22:12.663
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that depictions

22:12.815 --> 22:15.558
of figures encompassed
by bubbles found

22:15.651 --> 22:18.485
throughout history
and all around the world

22:18.504 --> 22:22.322
represent an alien technology?

22:22.342 --> 22:25.084
Perhaps further clues
can be found

22:25.236 --> 22:28.404
by examining another
extraordinary Navy video

22:28.422 --> 22:30.422
and its direct connection

22:30.516 --> 22:31.932
to the ancient world.

22:43.863 --> 22:47.089
NARRATOR:
Veteran journalist George Knapp

22:47.108 --> 22:50.201
and documentary filmmaker
Jeremy Corbell

22:50.352 --> 22:54.205
publish astonishing video
they acquired from the USS<i> Omaha</i>

22:54.432 --> 22:57.541
that shows a mysterious
spherical object

22:57.693 --> 23:01.528
flying at speeds approaching
160 miles per hour

23:01.547 --> 23:03.798
before disappearing
into the ocean.

23:06.777 --> 23:11.280
The USS<i> Omaha</i> is one of
the central pieces of evidence

23:11.298 --> 23:14.058
that I've put forward to
the American and global public.

23:14.209 --> 23:17.970
There were objects that were
swarming this Navy warship,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.471
and one in particular

23:19.624 --> 23:22.215
appears to transcend

23:22.235 --> 23:24.793
between the space of air
and into sea.

23:24.887 --> 23:27.220
They call that
a trans-medium vehicle,

23:27.240 --> 23:29.723
a vehicle that can operate
equally as well

23:29.742 --> 23:32.484
from in the air
and under the water.

23:32.637 --> 23:34.820
Now, this was suspected,

23:34.972 --> 23:37.063
but when they went
to go look for this craft

23:37.158 --> 23:40.309
under the water,
or for wreckage,

23:40.327 --> 23:41.585
none was found.

23:44.573 --> 23:46.999
NARRATOR: Tennessee
representative Tim Burchett,

23:47.093 --> 23:50.669
an outspoken proponent
for disclosure of UFO sightings,

23:50.821 --> 23:55.174
was one of the first members of
Congress to review the footage.

23:55.326 --> 23:56.917
TIM BURCHETT:
To me, i-it's pretty astounding

23:57.011 --> 23:58.827
when they showed
that craft actually

23:58.846 --> 24:00.496
going in and it popping up.

24:00.514 --> 24:01.922
It looked like
it didn't even slow down.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.515
There wasn't any friction at all

24:03.609 --> 24:05.943
when it hit the water,
so, to me, that's something

24:06.094 --> 24:08.112
that we can't even begin
to understand, I don't think.

24:08.339 --> 24:10.931
I've read the mathematical
equations of friction

24:10.950 --> 24:13.117
and things like that, and
it just defies all of that.

24:14.845 --> 24:16.120
TAYLOR:
How could a vehicle

24:16.347 --> 24:18.956
fly into the water
at 100 miles per hour?

24:19.107 --> 24:22.776
Well, that suggests either
the surface of this vehicle

24:22.795 --> 24:24.444
is frictionless,

24:24.464 --> 24:26.855
and it wouldn't have
any interaction

24:26.874 --> 24:29.449
with any material
it was flying through,

24:29.469 --> 24:32.803
or it's not frictionless,
it's actually a warp bubble

24:33.030 --> 24:36.215
where the spacecraft
or craft is inside it.

24:36.367 --> 24:40.144
The stresses and strains by
flying through the atmosphere

24:40.295 --> 24:42.796
in outer space and then
plunging into the oceans

24:42.890 --> 24:46.150
would be enough to rupture
any of our known aircraft.

24:47.561 --> 24:50.546
POPE:
These reports of USOs,

24:50.564 --> 24:55.659
unidentified submerged
or submersible objects,

24:55.811 --> 24:58.645
are much more common
than people might suppose.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.981
In 1991,

25:01.075 --> 25:03.000
Jing Yu Xian, a fisherman

25:03.151 --> 25:05.318
was at Fuxian Lake

25:05.338 --> 25:08.154
when he encountered
this strange craft

25:08.249 --> 25:10.991
in the waters of the lake.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.827
He described it
as a shining disc.

25:13.846 --> 25:18.182
This UFO was so close
and so powerful

25:18.409 --> 25:20.601
that it actually tossed
the boat around.

25:22.913 --> 25:26.690
And then rapidly this craft just
disappeared up into the sky.

25:26.842 --> 25:30.936
Over the years, there have
been many, many cases

25:31.088 --> 25:33.346
of UFOs seen over the water,

25:33.366 --> 25:36.091
disappearing under the water,

25:36.110 --> 25:40.037
and in some cases,
emerging from under the water.

25:40.264 --> 25:43.690
CHILDRESS:
On December 29, 2020,

25:43.709 --> 25:46.377
a very curious thing
happened off of the coast

25:46.528 --> 25:47.878
of Hawaii.

25:48.105 --> 25:53.217
People could see a huge
cigar-shaped craft

25:53.368 --> 25:55.627
hovering off the coast

25:55.780 --> 25:58.130
and took photos of it, and,

25:58.224 --> 26:02.208
eventually, this craft
then plunged into the ocean.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.970
And the Navy
went out there to also

26:05.122 --> 26:07.639
look for possible wreckage
of some craft

26:07.733 --> 26:09.900
crashing into the ocean
and found nothing.

26:12.146 --> 26:15.239
POPE: One theory about
this trans-medium travel

26:15.466 --> 26:18.725
and these USOs is that
what we're seeing

26:18.744 --> 26:21.470
is evidence of underwater bases.

26:21.563 --> 26:24.898
Now, this makes
a good deal of sense.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.643
I mean, the distance involved

26:27.661 --> 26:29.828
for interstellar travel

26:29.980 --> 26:32.815
means that it's much easier
to have a base

26:32.908 --> 26:35.317
on the location
that you're interested in

26:35.336 --> 26:38.337
than to constantly travel
there and back.

26:38.431 --> 26:42.324
But what if that presence
goes back millennia?

26:42.417 --> 26:45.010
They're operating here,
but under the oceans,

26:45.104 --> 26:48.513
right under our noses.

26:48.666 --> 26:51.925
HENRY: When we see the spherical
object in the video taken by

26:52.019 --> 26:55.337
the USS<i> Omaha</i>
hovering for a time

26:55.356 --> 26:57.339
and then descending
into the water,

26:57.358 --> 27:00.433
this opens up some
really interesting concepts

27:00.453 --> 27:02.177
in relation
to the ancient world.

27:02.270 --> 27:05.364
For example,
in Sumeria and in Babylon,

27:05.458 --> 27:08.200
they talked about a god
being named Oannes

27:08.294 --> 27:10.202
who lived in the sea,

27:10.354 --> 27:14.189
who emerged from the sea
wearing a fish cloak.

27:14.282 --> 27:16.300
He was, uh, an initiator
of humanity,

27:16.451 --> 27:19.285
who taught writing and science
and-and other concepts.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.047
What's amazing about this
is that Oannes

27:22.199 --> 27:23.957
also founded a priesthood

27:24.051 --> 27:26.793
of beings called
Apkallu priests,

27:26.887 --> 27:28.962
who also wore fish cloaks.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.056
And in Sumerian cylinder seals,

27:31.208 --> 27:33.466
we see these Apkallu priests

27:33.486 --> 27:36.803
on either side of a luminous
or radiant tree of life

27:36.822 --> 27:39.231
with a winged disc
hovering above.

27:39.325 --> 27:44.219
The inference is-is that
this craft came from the sea

27:44.312 --> 27:47.331
because these are priests
of a sea being.

27:47.558 --> 27:50.150
And so, here's an example
of an ancient being

27:50.169 --> 27:52.920
emerging from the sea
and connected with a craft.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.733
NARRATOR: Oannes belonged
to a group of powerful beings

27:57.751 --> 28:01.086
known in ancient Mesopotamia
as the Anunnaki.

28:01.238 --> 28:03.514
The term Anunnaki means

28:03.665 --> 28:06.758
"those who
from the heavens came,"

28:06.911 --> 28:09.077
and refers to beings

28:09.096 --> 28:12.690
descending from the sky,
imparting knowledge.

28:12.841 --> 28:16.585
That is the most important thing
that we can read and learn

28:16.603 --> 28:20.847
about the Anunnaki,
that they were our teachers.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.941
So, I think it's very possible

28:23.093 --> 28:25.351
that what the ancient
people tried to record

28:25.446 --> 28:27.496
was an extraterrestrial
visitation.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.283
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

28:31.377 --> 28:34.694
perhaps the most compelling
evidence of an alien presence

28:34.714 --> 28:36.696
that traverses Earth's oceans

28:36.790 --> 28:40.384
can be found in an account
from 1492,

28:40.535 --> 28:43.036
recorded by
Christopher Columbus.

28:43.130 --> 28:46.782
CHILDRESS: It's a famous
story about Christopher Columbus,

28:46.875 --> 28:48.892
and he wrote this
in his journals,

28:49.044 --> 28:52.637
that as he was moving west
across the Atlantic

28:52.790 --> 28:55.140
towards the Caribbean
in his first voyage,

28:55.292 --> 28:58.384
he saw a light out in the ocean

28:58.404 --> 29:01.964
to the west hovering
over the water,

29:02.057 --> 29:05.909
and this light then descended
into the water,

29:06.061 --> 29:08.987
but Columbus felt that
this light was guiding him

29:09.139 --> 29:10.914
towards his destination.

29:11.141 --> 29:15.811
So, if this glowing object
that Columbus saw did,

29:15.829 --> 29:17.646
you know, go into the water,

29:17.664 --> 29:21.074
he's perhaps one of
the first witnesses to describe

29:21.168 --> 29:23.485
a trans-medium craft like this,

29:23.578 --> 29:26.171
which could hover, uh,
above the water

29:26.323 --> 29:28.340
and then disappear into it
like a submarine.

29:28.492 --> 29:31.994
NARRATOR: Could the
account of Christopher Columbus

29:32.012 --> 29:34.997
and the ancient Babylonian
stories of Oannes

29:35.015 --> 29:36.440
have a profound connection

29:36.667 --> 29:40.352
to the object recorded
from the USS<i> Omaha?</i>

29:40.504 --> 29:44.506
Do they provide further evidence
that the same crafts witnessed

29:44.525 --> 29:48.619
in the distant past are still
visiting Earth in the present?

29:50.030 --> 29:53.106
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

29:53.125 --> 29:55.626
and believe the ultimate
proof of this

29:55.853 --> 29:58.712
can be found
in the Hebrew Bible.

30:10.384 --> 30:12.810
NARRATOR: Just
outside the Capitol Building,

30:13.037 --> 30:15.053
Congressman Tim Burchett
of Tennessee

30:15.147 --> 30:16.647
speaks with a reporter

30:16.798 --> 30:19.724
about the much-anticipated
government UAP report,

30:19.819 --> 30:22.653
due to be released
in less than two weeks.

30:22.804 --> 30:24.729
To the surprise of many,

30:24.882 --> 30:26.715
he suggests that UFOs

30:26.808 --> 30:29.067
have been around
for all of human history,

30:29.219 --> 30:30.569
and can even be found

30:30.721 --> 30:33.330
in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel.

30:33.481 --> 30:34.906
POPE:
I was intrigued

30:35.000 --> 30:37.559
when I heard that
Congressional representative

30:37.578 --> 30:41.487
Tim Burchett had talked
about these UFOs

30:41.507 --> 30:43.582
and said, "Well, this is
straight out of the Bible.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.233
This is the Book of Ezekiel."

30:45.327 --> 30:47.327
And I thought, "My goodness,

30:47.346 --> 30:49.096
he's an ancient
astronaut theorist."

30:51.517 --> 30:54.242
CORBELL: We have seen
a lot of unsolicited comments

30:54.336 --> 30:56.428
by congressmen, politicians,

30:56.580 --> 30:59.081
uh, even heads of the CIA

30:59.099 --> 31:02.751
have come forward
and given opinions about UFOs.

31:02.844 --> 31:04.844
This has been such a shocking

31:04.864 --> 31:07.939
and revelatory few years
about UFOs

31:08.033 --> 31:10.534
that you're now seeing people
go back to the Bible

31:10.761 --> 31:13.261
and trying to understand
if those events

31:13.280 --> 31:15.355
are similar to the events
that we're having today.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.358
NARRATOR: Congressman
Burchett's bold assertion

31:18.377 --> 31:21.103
that UFOs can be found
in the Bible

31:21.121 --> 31:23.939
was a conclusion he came to
after careful study

31:23.957 --> 31:25.549
of the Book of Ezekiel.

31:27.277 --> 31:29.035
According to this text,

31:29.054 --> 31:32.964
the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel
describes a fiery chariot

31:33.058 --> 31:37.728
coming down from the sky
drawn by four living creatures.

31:37.955 --> 31:41.398
Each creature is flanked
by a metallic object,

31:41.549 --> 31:44.902
a wheel within a wheel,
that Ezekiel observes

31:45.053 --> 31:48.572
as it descends in a whirlwind
making tremendous noise.

31:48.723 --> 31:51.466
BURCHETT: It's pretty clear
what's going on in the Bible,

31:51.559 --> 31:53.243
what he's describing, to me.

31:53.470 --> 31:56.138
I've read it many times.
You got to realize,

31:56.231 --> 31:59.141
Ezekiel was in sixth century BC,

31:59.159 --> 32:01.309
but he basically describes

32:01.328 --> 32:04.404
what I would say was what
people describe as a UFO.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.905
I mean, it's a wheel
within a wheel,

32:05.925 --> 32:07.257
there's fire,
there's landing gear.

32:07.484 --> 32:10.652
To me, it sounds like
there's a craft landing,

32:10.671 --> 32:12.988
and there are
smaller craft around it

32:13.006 --> 32:15.006
that are providing
protection for it.

32:15.159 --> 32:18.101
And, you know, it's what we see

32:18.253 --> 32:20.345
when you see the president
land in a helicopter.

32:20.497 --> 32:22.755
There's not just one helicopter,
there's multiple helicopters.

32:22.849 --> 32:25.091
So, to me, it sounds like

32:25.185 --> 32:27.852
Ezekiel saw something that he
could not accurately describe,

32:28.005 --> 32:30.355
and he used things around him

32:30.507 --> 32:32.524
that he would see
in a day-to-day basis

32:32.618 --> 32:34.526
to describe what he saw.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.121
The closest thing he has is a
wheel because that was the, uh,

32:38.348 --> 32:41.274
pinnacle of technology
at that time, was a wheel.

32:41.368 --> 32:44.294
NARRATOR: To Congressman
Burchett and many others,

32:44.446 --> 32:46.521
the Navy videos indicate

32:46.614 --> 32:48.448
that crafts like those
seen by Ezekiel

32:48.467 --> 32:51.117
are still with us
in the present.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.786
BURCHETT: I think it's the same
type of thing that's being depicted,

32:53.806 --> 32:56.198
in olden times
that's being depicted today

32:56.291 --> 32:58.809
in some of those Navy tapes.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.052
There's just too much similarity
for it not to be.

33:01.205 --> 33:04.481
If you heard those Navy pilots,
they're the sharpest we've got.

33:07.211 --> 33:08.485
BURCHETT:
You can tell they're excited,

33:08.636 --> 33:10.821
and they're trying to explain
what they're seeing,

33:10.972 --> 33:14.399
much like Ezekiel would try
to define what he was seeing.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.977
And so, I think that, um,
that it-it proves that

33:18.071 --> 33:20.146
we're definitely not alone.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.333
NARRATOR:
To many UFO researchers,

33:23.560 --> 33:25.894
the only difference
between ancient sightings

33:25.912 --> 33:29.506
like Ezekiel's and modern
21st-century encounters

33:29.733 --> 33:31.491
is that, today,
people have the technology

33:31.510 --> 33:33.659
- to record them.
- (camera shutter clicks)

33:33.679 --> 33:37.072
CORBELL:
We have seen throughout history

33:37.165 --> 33:39.741
that individuals will testify

33:39.760 --> 33:42.927
to seeing in the sky,
you know, shields on fire,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.856
or things that just
are not aerodynamic.

33:46.007 --> 33:50.176
Now, because of the-the nature
of our technology

33:50.195 --> 33:51.586
and our corroborative evidence,

33:51.679 --> 33:54.514
we have more information to say,

33:54.608 --> 33:58.201
"Yes, this happened exactly like
this witness said it happened."

33:58.428 --> 34:01.263
We just didn't have that
150 years ago.

34:01.281 --> 34:02.873
We just didn't have
that capability.

34:03.024 --> 34:07.527
The difference now is that we
are able to artificially capture

34:07.546 --> 34:12.698
these craft and these
objects to a precise measuring

34:12.718 --> 34:14.718
of the rotation and the speeds.

34:14.869 --> 34:17.036
That is just something
we did not have before.

34:17.130 --> 34:20.632
We did not have it before,
but we have it now, so it's...

34:20.726 --> 34:22.726
I mean, kind of an exciting time
to be alive. (chuckles)

34:24.563 --> 34:27.547
TSOUKALOS: Countless times
our ancestors referred to these things

34:27.641 --> 34:31.068
up in the sky as flying shields

34:31.219 --> 34:33.311
or flying furnaces.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.741
Today, we actually refer to that
as flying craft,

34:37.892 --> 34:41.894
flying machines,
unidentified aerial phenomena.

34:41.914 --> 34:45.657
Back then,
people didn't have those words.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.751
And so, in my opinion,

34:47.978 --> 34:50.829
there is a clear
connection between

34:50.981 --> 34:53.315
the sightings that we have today

34:53.333 --> 34:55.500
and the sightings
that we have in the past

34:55.594 --> 34:58.911
because if we would not have
the vocabulary,

34:58.931 --> 35:01.264
what we see in those Navy videos

35:01.491 --> 35:04.676
can be described
as a flying shield.

35:04.828 --> 35:07.996
These kinds of images
have been with us

35:08.089 --> 35:10.348
throughout our entire history,

35:10.500 --> 35:15.112
and they're all telling
the same thing,

35:15.339 --> 35:19.098
that the ancient astronauts
never left.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.843
The same visitors
that we've had back then

35:21.936 --> 35:24.529
are showing themselves again,

35:24.681 --> 35:26.531
and this time publicly.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.791
It's incredible.

35:30.036 --> 35:31.444
NARRATOR:
As the photographic and video

35:31.463 --> 35:34.856
evidence of UFOs
continues to grow,

35:34.949 --> 35:37.709
so, too, does the
number of people

35:37.803 --> 35:39.694
who believe that governments
around the world

35:39.713 --> 35:42.305
know more than they
are disclosing.

35:42.457 --> 35:45.625
POPE: The idea that there's
an alien presence, and the idea

35:45.644 --> 35:47.793
that the U.S. government,
amongst others,

35:47.888 --> 35:49.871
knows about all this

35:49.890 --> 35:52.891
is coming out of the fringe
and into the mainstream.

35:52.985 --> 35:56.227
Now, you hear of people
in Congress talk about it.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.730
We do not need to fear
these-these airborne

35:58.824 --> 36:00.382
unidentified objects.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.066
They would've shown themselves
to be dangerous

36:02.161 --> 36:04.327
a long time ago by now
if they were a threat.

36:04.554 --> 36:07.222
BURCHETT: I wished
our intelligence community

36:07.240 --> 36:09.391
would release everything
they have on that.

36:09.484 --> 36:11.726
The higher-ups put out
a lot that some

36:11.819 --> 36:14.987
of these recent tapes were just
sort of a joke, was an anomaly,

36:15.007 --> 36:17.174
but we sure have had
a heck of a lot of anomalies.

36:17.401 --> 36:19.843
I think there's a lot more
going on to this.

36:20.070 --> 36:21.753
I've talked to
military and people

36:21.905 --> 36:24.422
that, when something like this
happens, they are generally

36:24.516 --> 36:26.925
told not to bring it up.

36:27.077 --> 36:29.093
They can have psych evaluations,

36:29.246 --> 36:31.246
they can have things
put in their records,

36:31.264 --> 36:34.416
and they're encouraged not to
bring these kind of things up.

36:34.434 --> 36:37.009
NARRATOR:
If the United States government

36:37.029 --> 36:39.512
and other governments
around the world

36:39.606 --> 36:44.016
were to reveal all the evidence
they have concerning UFOs,

36:44.110 --> 36:46.945
would it show irrefutable proof

36:47.097 --> 36:49.948
that there is an alien
air force on Earth?

36:50.100 --> 36:52.600
Ancient astronaut theorists

36:52.619 --> 36:55.879
suspect the truth
is even more incredible,

36:56.106 --> 36:59.216
and that hidden away
in top-secret facilities

36:59.367 --> 37:00.608
around the globe

37:00.702 --> 37:04.054
are recovered
extraterrestrial craft.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.398
NARRATOR: NASA's
Advanced Propulsion Physics Lab,

37:15.625 --> 37:17.809
known as the
"Eagleworks Project,"

37:17.903 --> 37:21.646
announces that, based on
their latest experiments,

37:21.798 --> 37:23.298
they now believe it is possible

37:23.391 --> 37:25.633
to create an actual warp drive

37:25.727 --> 37:30.805
and a spacecraft that can travel
faster than the speed of light.

37:30.824 --> 37:32.807
TAYLOR:
The team at NASA's Eagleworks

37:32.826 --> 37:36.494
has been trying to reproduce
a warp field, and

37:36.646 --> 37:38.663
the results have been
right at the edge

37:38.815 --> 37:40.573
of experimental error right now.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.667
So, they're not ready to go
build the Starship<i> Enterprise,</i>

37:42.761 --> 37:45.762
but it's possible that
they can do an experiment

37:45.913 --> 37:48.656
that says we could build
the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

37:48.750 --> 37:50.082
if we put enough work into it.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.751
NARRATOR:
While some believe

37:51.770 --> 37:54.012
that such
a revolutionary technology

37:54.164 --> 37:57.682
is purely the result
of human ingenuity,

37:57.776 --> 38:01.111
others maintain that
such advances are possible

38:01.338 --> 38:04.188
because secret
government agencies possess,

38:04.283 --> 38:07.951
and are able to study,
crashed alien vehicles.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.529
It is a theory that
goes back to the famous

38:11.681 --> 38:15.107
Roswell crash of 1947.

38:15.201 --> 38:18.295
BURCHETT: Roswell happened
in '47. Roswell, New Mexico.

38:18.522 --> 38:20.371
They put out,
you know, UFO crash,

38:20.524 --> 38:22.040
and it was on the headlines
of the papers.

38:22.192 --> 38:24.876
Then, the next day,
they came back and said,

38:25.028 --> 38:26.619
"No, in fact,
it was a weather balloon."

38:26.713 --> 38:29.806
And it just contradicted
everything everybody had said.

38:32.126 --> 38:34.536
NARRATOR: Many have
alleged that the U.S. government

38:34.629 --> 38:36.479
secretly retrieved
an alien spacecraft

38:36.631 --> 38:38.464
from Roswell.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.966
In 1989,

38:41.061 --> 38:44.712
a scientist named Bob Lazar
even came forward to say

38:44.806 --> 38:46.656
that he worked
for the U.S. government

38:46.808 --> 38:50.401
reverse engineering crashed
extraterrestrial vehicles,

38:50.554 --> 38:52.554
divulging incredible details

38:52.572 --> 38:56.482
about the secret project
in the years that followed.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.395
The government is holding, uh,
nine alien spacecraft,

39:00.488 --> 39:04.749
um, that are propelled by, um,

39:04.901 --> 39:06.584
a modified gravity generator.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.070
Uh...

39:09.089 --> 39:10.755
It's being-- the work
is being conducted

39:10.907 --> 39:12.331
15 miles south of Groom Lake.

39:13.093 --> 39:15.352
CORBELL: The only
reason you know about UFOs

39:15.503 --> 39:17.095
and Area 51

39:17.247 --> 39:20.190
and that connection
is because of Bob Lazar.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.435
He was faced with a lot
of adversity through this.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.753
But, in my eyes,

39:25.847 --> 39:27.179
he's telling you the truth,

39:27.199 --> 39:29.866
and it's backed up
time and time again.

39:31.444 --> 39:32.702
NARRATOR:
For decades,

39:32.929 --> 39:35.521
the U.S. government
denied Lazar's claims,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.932
as well as the existence
of the facility

39:37.951 --> 39:40.693
where he said the alien craft
were being held,

39:40.712 --> 39:42.629
Area 51.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.882
But in 2013,

39:46.109 --> 39:48.276
a Freedom
of Information Act request

39:48.369 --> 39:50.128
finally forced
officials to admit

39:50.222 --> 39:53.056
that Area 51 is real.

39:54.208 --> 39:56.375
BURCHETT:
For the government to say

39:56.395 --> 39:58.453
the things they say
and to hold back

39:58.471 --> 39:59.954
on these reports,

39:59.973 --> 40:04.401
it goes back to Roswell
or any of those other...

40:04.628 --> 40:06.903
spots. It's just,
um, nobody trusts

40:07.130 --> 40:08.721
the government.
They don't trust government,

40:08.740 --> 40:10.298
and they really, frankly,
they shouldn't.

40:10.391 --> 40:12.075
We-we don't keep
our word on anything.

40:13.653 --> 40:16.079
NARRATOR: The United
States isn't the only country

40:16.230 --> 40:19.249
accused of covering up attempts
to study alien craft.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.978
Many believe the Russians
have a similar UFO program

40:24.071 --> 40:26.071
at a site called Kapustin Yar,

40:26.091 --> 40:30.001
often nicknamed
the Russian Area 51.

40:30.153 --> 40:33.488
HENRY: Kapustin Yar was
one of the former Soviet Union's

40:33.506 --> 40:34.989
most secretive air bases.

40:35.008 --> 40:38.083
The rumor is, is they were
reverse engineering

40:38.103 --> 40:39.677
UFO technology

40:39.771 --> 40:42.847
that could be as much
as 1,000 years in advance

40:42.999 --> 40:44.023
of what we have today.

40:45.927 --> 40:49.170
NARRATOR: Recovered alien
vehicles are also rumored to be held

40:49.189 --> 40:52.431
at the Pine Gap military base
in Australia,

40:52.451 --> 40:55.193
at a mysterious desert airfield

40:55.345 --> 40:57.603
in the Xinjiang region of China,

40:57.697 --> 41:01.124
and at Rudloe Manor in England.

41:01.351 --> 41:04.702
With these craft coming
from other planets

41:04.854 --> 41:06.111
and other solar systems,

41:06.131 --> 41:09.299
this is clearly a very
advanced technology,

41:09.526 --> 41:12.527
and we are now
trying to catch up

41:12.545 --> 41:14.195
to these extraterrestrials

41:14.214 --> 41:16.455
and have the same kind
of technology

41:16.549 --> 41:17.807
that they already have.

41:18.034 --> 41:19.642
BURCHETT: It's clear
that there's something

41:19.794 --> 41:21.035
we don't understand,

41:21.054 --> 41:22.537
and we're not sure
where it comes from,

41:22.555 --> 41:24.038
and I just wish
they'd just say that.

41:24.057 --> 41:27.058
They think that the American
public can't handle it,

41:27.152 --> 41:29.319
and they can, in fact,
handle it, I think, very well.

41:29.470 --> 41:33.156
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the sensational footage

41:33.307 --> 41:35.383
recently released
by the U.S. Navy

41:35.401 --> 41:38.720
features the same type
of aerial vehicles

41:38.813 --> 41:41.313
that were documented
by our ancestors?

41:41.333 --> 41:44.392
Do we now have
overwhelming evidence

41:44.485 --> 41:47.729
that alien craft not only exist,

41:47.747 --> 41:49.897
but have been present
on planet Earth

41:49.916 --> 41:52.175
for thousands of years?

41:52.326 --> 41:54.585
Perhaps, when we
discover just who

41:54.738 --> 41:57.405
is behind the UFO phenomenon,

41:57.423 --> 42:00.742
we will uncover
an even more profound truth,

42:00.760 --> 42:05.079
that extraterrestrials
have been living among us

42:05.098 --> 42:06.523
all along.
