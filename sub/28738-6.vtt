47:33.510 --> 47:36.210
That is my constant prayer
for Nichole.

47:36.210 --> 47:38.240
I trusted you.

47:39.970 --> 47:43.240
To let her have
the best life possible.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.480
To do the right thing.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.690
And I trusted you
to stay with her.

47:46.690 --> 47:47.880
I gave her the name of Nichole.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.050
I did that to honor you

47:49.050 --> 47:50.220
for getting her out.

47:50.220 --> 47:51.950
You will not let her go!

47:51.950 --> 47:53.830
Because I love her!

47:53.830 --> 47:55.870
This isn't love.

47:55.870 --> 47:57.660
You can't love!

47:57.660 --> 48:00.710
You don't know how!

48:00.710 --> 48:03.870
Serena,
you built this whole world

48:03.870 --> 48:06.900
just so that you
can have someone.

48:08.860 --> 48:10.050
But it didn't work.

48:12.670 --> 48:14.690
You're small.

48:16.540 --> 48:18.560
You're cruel.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.510
And you're empty.

48:29.550 --> 48:32.460
You will always be...

48:32.460 --> 48:34.120
empty.

48:52.940 --> 48:55.250
I should have put
a ring in your mouth

48:55.250 --> 48:57.420
the day that we met.

49:00.450 --> 49:02.050
I should have let you burn

49:02.050 --> 49:03.890
when I had the chance.

52:40.690 --> 52:43.320
hear our prayer.

Children are a heritage

53:31.990 --> 53:33.450

53:48.660 --> 53:50.510
is full of them.

53:50.510 --> 53:54.240
They will not be put to shame

53:54.240 --> 53:57.440

with their enemies.
