Quit it. Quit it.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.703
Quit it! Mom!
Bart's making faces.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.955
Stop that, Bart.
Homer, speak to him.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.043
Blah. Blee. Bleh.
(chuckles) Stupid animals.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.963
Ah, the daily newspaper.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.926
Ooh, the Springfield men's shelter
is giving away 60 soiled mattresses.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.638
Why do you read that "free" column, Homer?
They never have anything good.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.392
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

00:59.476 --> 01:03.021
-What is it?
-"Tramampoline." "Trambapoline."

01:03.104 --> 01:04.105
He said what now?

01:04.189 --> 01:07.067
Please, don't bring home

-Hey. That seltzer ain't free.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.341
-(gasps) Krusty!
-That's me.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.344
(goofy laugh)
You here for the trampoline?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.346
Yeah. What's the deal?

01:36.429 --> 01:38.807
Well, I used to do
a lot of tumbling in my act,

01:38.890 --> 01:41.559
but I'm phasing it out
for more dirty limericks.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.772
-There once was a man named Enis--
-I can just haul it away, free?

01:45.855 --> 01:49.442
Yep. It's all yours.

You're a good dog, aren't you, boy?
Aren't ya?

02:01.871 --> 02:05.416
Hi, son.
Hi, son.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.543
-Hmm?
-Hi, son.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.128
Wow!

02:08.211 --> 02:11.256
(panting)
I can't believe it.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.092
Whoa. Whoo-hoo!

02:14.175 --> 02:18.638
Dad, this one gesture almost makes up
for years of shaky fathering.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.431

LISA: I'm gonna have
my wedding here.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.650
Whoa! Whoa!

02:30.733 --> 02:32.861
I don't know
if this is a good idea.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.571
HOMER: Marge,
it's the perfect exercise.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.281
It'll double the value
of our house,

02:36.364 --> 02:38.408
and it was free-- free!

02:38.491 --> 02:41.661
-Are you sure it's safe?
-Absolutely.

02:41.744 --> 02:46.207
And this is just the beginning.
I've got some big plans.

02:48.293 --> 02:52.630
-♪♪ (calliope)
-(delighted squeals)

02:57.969 --> 03:01.389
-It smells funny in there.
-No, it doesn't.

03:04.893 --> 03:09.063
Whoo.
(laughing)

03:09.147 --> 03:12.317
Whoa.

-Otto, are you okay?

03:15.153 --> 03:17.447
-Yeah. Just pop my shoulder back in.
-(cracks)

03:17.530 --> 03:21.034
Ooh. Thanks, buddy.
Hey, I lost my turn.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.871
Oh! My arm.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.957
Whee! Ow!
I bit my tongue.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.294
Each leap brings us
closer to God.

03:31.377 --> 03:35.048
-Catch me, Lord. Catch me. Wh--
-Ow!

03:35.131 --> 03:38.509
-What have we done to make God angry?
-You did it.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.429
Stop jumping on me.
I'm hurt.

03:41.512 --> 03:45.725
Kids, kids. Once you get hurt,
move aside and let other people jump.

03:45.808 --> 03:50.396
-Homer, this is terrible.
-Okay. Okay. I'll take care of it.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.736
-Hmm?
-(moaning)

03:56.819 --> 04:00.698
(all moaning)

04:04.619 --> 04:06.955
I told you
this was a bad idea.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.749
All right, all right!
I'll get rid of the trampoline.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.337
Hey, Krusty.
I'm bringing back the--

04:14.420 --> 04:16.631
You just keep
right on driving.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
(grunts)
There we go.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.437
That's the last I'll see
of Mr. Trampoline.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.691
Yep, it's finally gone.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.235
D'oh!
(grunting)

04:40.738 --> 04:45.535
If this were a cartoon,
the cliff would break off now.

04:46.911 --> 04:51.124

05:06.389 --> 05:08.683
(yelling)
Oh!

05:11.728 --> 05:14.689
All right. All right.
You win for now,

05:14.772 --> 05:18.443
but someday you'll rust!

05:18.526 --> 05:23.031
Rust, I tell ya!
(hysterical laughter)

05:23.114 --> 05:25.658
Dad. Dad?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.160
You really wanna get rid
of this trampoline?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.119
Uh-huh.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.538
Observe. A bike lock.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.415
(chain rattles,
lock clicks)

05:32.498 --> 05:34.751
Now just turn around
and count to three.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.087
One, two, three.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.298
Uh, better make it five.

05:40.381 --> 05:44.093
-(chain rattles)
-All right. I got me a bed.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.347
DOLPH: Shh! Quiet.
You'll wake up Old Man Simpson.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.474
JIMBO:
Hey, no more trampoline.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.559
DOLPH:
Let's jump on the car instead.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.937
-(metal thudding)
-(boys grunting)

05:55.021 --> 05:57.690
Okay, the trampoline
was a bad idea.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.277
But you know what?
At least I'm out there trying new things.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.364
If it were up to you, all we'd ever do
is work and go to church.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.907
That's not true.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.326
Name one thing you've done in
the past month that was fun.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.662
I can name 10 things.
Um...

06:11.746 --> 06:14.999
-I made Sloppy Joes.
-(scoffs) That's not fun.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.878
Kids, tell me the truth. Am I no fun?
Do I just nag all the time?

06:20.463 --> 06:21.923
-Um.
-Um.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.925
-Well.
-Uh--

06:24.008 --> 06:26.219
You should've called.
I was very worried.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.346
We're on a tight budget here.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.181
Bart, watch your language.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.683
You are not going to perform
that operation yourself.

06:32.767 --> 06:37.021
(groans)

06:37.105 --> 06:41.859
-See, Marge?
-I didn't realize people saw me that way.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.029
-Are you mad?
-No, I'm fine.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.614
I'm going
to my sisters' now.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.869
NED: Careful there, Marge.
You almost nicked me.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.915
Well, your blood pressure
is off the chart.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.501
And I don't like
this urine sample one bit.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.838
You're headed for a nervous breakdown.
You need Brad Goodman.

That video
really opened my eyes.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.814
I can see that I'm just
a passive-aggressive coculprit.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.233
By nagging you when
you do foolish things,

09:27.316 --> 09:29.443
I just enable
your life-script.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.029
And that sends me into
a shame spiral.

09:32.113 --> 09:36.867
Exactly. So from now on, I'm going to
quit nagging and have more fun.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.706
Homer, did you eat
my whole pan of brownies?

Uh-oh. You're in for it
now, Dad.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.171
Marge, I'm feeling
a lot of shame right now.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.716
I'm hearing that
you feel a lot of shame.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.843
And I feel that
you hear my shame.

09:53.926 --> 09:58.681
I'm feeling annoyance
and frustration, but also tolerance.

09:58.764 --> 10:03.060
-I feel validated by that.
-Good. I'm glad we had this talk.

Well, here we are

10:31.005 --> 10:33.466
-We know, Dad.
-I just thought I'd remind everybody.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.552
After all, we did agree
to attend a self-help seminar.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.554
What an odd thing to say.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.058

-Thank you.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.643
Okay, folks.
Let me hear what's troubling you.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.228
Don't be shy. Yell it out. Everybody. Go.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.690
-I, uh, can't commit to a relationship.
-I'm too nice.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.568
-I have problems with--
-I'm always interrupting people.

10:52.652 --> 10:58.157
Okay. Okay. Right now, I want each of you
to try something interesting.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.035
There's no trick to it.
It's just a simple trick.

11:01.118 --> 11:05.873
Now, close your eyes for a moment and
really listen to that inner voice inside.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.584
Your inner child.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.961
(quietly)
Listen. What's he saying?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.547
Stay the course, Big Ned.
You're doing super.

Hey, Moe. What'sa matter?

11:23.224 --> 11:26.811
-You no talka with your accent no more.
-Mamma mia.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.648
Principal Skinner,
let's try some rage work.

11:30.731 --> 11:34.026
I want you to pretend this dummy

11:34.110 --> 11:35.903
Okay, I'll try.
(chuckles)

11:35.986 --> 11:40.616
Tell this dummy mother
exactly how you feel right now.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.370
I'm annoyed with you, Mother.
Not just annoyed, angry.

11:44.453 --> 11:48.999
I'm a grown man now,
and I can run my own life!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.460

11:51.544 --> 11:56.465
(whispering) Shh-shh. Calm down.
Calm down. Moving. You can sit down now.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.510
We're still going antiquing
on Saturday, right, Mother?

11:59.593 --> 12:04.640
You see, folks?
We're all trying to please someone else.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.018
And as soon as you're not
a human being,

12:08.102 --> 12:11.021
you're a human doing.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.233
-Then what comes next?
-A human going!

12:14.316 --> 12:18.320
-(laughter)
-Bart, be quiet.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.906
Son, that's wonderful.
Come here. Come up here.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.326
What made you
yell out that remark?

12:24.410 --> 12:25.745
I don't know.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.123
You just wanted
to express yourself, yes?

12:29.206 --> 12:31.959

-That's marvelous.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.503
I couldn't have
put it better myself.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.549
"I do what I feel like."

12:38.632 --> 12:44.263
People, this young man here is
the inner child I've been talking about.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.306
What?

12:45.389 --> 12:48.100
Son, you've never read
any of my books, have you?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.562
-(snorts) Earth to boring guy.
-(laughter)

12:51.645 --> 12:55.232
(laughs) I get that means no, huh?
I'm not so old-fashioned.

12:55.316 --> 12:59.904
Your parents have done a fantastic job.
Mama? Papa? Could you come up here?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.822
-(applause)
-MAN: Yeah!

13:01.906 --> 13:05.659
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:05.743 --> 13:10.164
This is really remarkable. Here we have
a man with an obvious eating disorder,

13:10.247 --> 13:15.503
and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle--
I'm sure worn only for shock value.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.713
-(groans)
-And yet,

13:17.797 --> 13:21.759
they've managed to raise
an emotionally healthy son.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.720
-That's fantastic.
-Oh, thank you.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.263
We can all learn a lot
from this young man here.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.015
-This-this--
-Rudiger.

13:28.098 --> 13:32.603
Rudiger. And if we can all
be more like little Rudiger--

13:32.686 --> 13:35.314
-His name is Bart.
-His name isn't important.

13:35.397 --> 13:39.902
What's important here is that this lad
has fully developed ego integrity...

13:39.985 --> 13:44.073
with well-defined boundaries.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.325

13:46.408 --> 13:50.162

13:50.246 --> 13:53.290
People, I am excited.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.001
I can sense a change
in the air tonight.

13:56.085 --> 14:00.548
You are all going to
start living. Really living.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.801

Yea! Living! Living!

14:03.884 --> 14:08.430
-Be like the boy.
-Be like boy! Be like boy!

-Just the ladies.
-Be like boy! Be like boy!

14:12.643 --> 14:17.982

It's simple, Bart.
You've defined yourself as a rebel.

16:27.194 --> 16:32.032
In the absence of a repressive milieu,
your societal niche has been co-opted.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.742
I see.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.244
Ever since that self-help guy
came to town,

16:35.327 --> 16:37.162
