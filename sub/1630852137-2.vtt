WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:09.920
For Juventus, this is the most
important season in history.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.240
A new coach at the lead.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.440
An era of change, during which
the most legendary players

00:14.520 --> 00:16.880
will have to help
the champions of tomorrow.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.320
Come on! Come on! Go!

00:22.160 --> 00:26.760
The race for the tenth title
started as expected.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.680
Ronaldo! Ronaldo! CR7 closes the game.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.120
Will the new Juventus

00:34.760 --> 00:36.400
be a winning team?

00:37.760 --> 00:40.240
The game has just begun.

00:47.240 --> 00:52.360
Pirlo's victorious debut against Sampdoria
was a good start for Juventus.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.240
-Good morning.
-Good morning, man.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.360
But there's no time
to rest on one's laurels.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.920
The season is long,
and integrating so many young players

01:03.000 --> 01:05.800
is a challenge both
for the club and for the coach.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.440
To lead the new arrivals,

01:08.520 --> 01:11.440
it is fundamental
that captain Giorgio Chiellini

01:11.520 --> 01:14.400
recovers from an annoying injury.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.400
Hi, Giò.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.760
Hi, Martone.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.760
Let's keep
the muscular stimulus low today,

01:19.840 --> 01:21.840
let's compensate
for yesterday’s work.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.720
Today we started physiotherapy,

01:24.800 --> 01:27.320
gym, and swimming pool. The hope is...

01:27.400 --> 01:29.320
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

01:29.400 --> 01:32.960
...to go back to train in a few weeks
because it's tough to stay out.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.640
Giorgio Chiellini, the captain of Juventus
and the national team,

01:47.720 --> 01:51.080
is one of the most
beloved players of his generation.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.080
He is the only one of Juventus' seniors
to have won the nine titles in a row

01:57.160 --> 01:58.880
of the last decade.

02:02.240 --> 02:07.120
His experience and his professionality
are of inspiration for the entire team.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.520
Both flexors, right and left.

02:11.880 --> 02:17.840
Last year, at 35 years old,
I had the first big injury of my career

02:19.760 --> 02:21.760
and it's not easy to accept it,

02:21.840 --> 02:25.400
because it's your life,

02:25.440 --> 02:28.440
because you give a 100 percent
in this job, maybe more.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.280
It's not easy for someone like me

02:33.360 --> 02:36.600
since I have been part of the team,
the field my entire career.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.360
I've always played a lot.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.280
Now I'm fighting
to feel better and help the team

02:43.360 --> 02:47.560
and take the last
satisfactions of my career.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.520
In the meantime,
Juventus tries to strengthen themselves

02:59.600 --> 03:03.080
with another great trade,
one of the most promising Italian player.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.520
5 OCTOBER, 2020

03:07.120 --> 03:11.720
The 23 year old Federico Chiesa,
son of '90s legendary striker Enrico,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.960
joins the group
of strikers at Pirlo's disposal.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.800
Honestly, I would have never imagined
playing for Juventus at 23.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.280
To play here is a dream. Because

03:23.360 --> 03:27.240
I'm young, I need to improve
and I can still give a lot to the team.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.160
FEDERICO CHIESA
STRIKER

03:28.240 --> 03:32.080
The mountain to climb is still high,

03:32.160 --> 03:34.840
there's much to pedal, and to pedal hard.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.760
At Juventus, Federico Chiesa finds Buffon,
an old friend and teammate of his father.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.560
In Parma,
I played with his father

03:44.640 --> 03:49.240
for two or three years. In those three
years together, we won a few cups.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.520
Well, we gave a few satisfactions
to the Parmesan people.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.040
And he was, poor him, still a kid.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.640
He knew even less than now.
Can you imagine how he was then?

03:59.720 --> 04:01.320
My father told me this story.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.680
You came to the house
with a headband and your hair all up...

04:04.760 --> 04:05.640
It's possible.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.400
I immediately started crying
the moment I saw you.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.840
-It's possible.
-He always tells me this story.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.120
It's possible.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.440
It was blond.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.240
Yes, it was blond.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.320
My first memory of Gigi is not in Parma,
because I was very young,

04:19.400 --> 04:21.480
but when he lifted the World Cup.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.360
GERMANY 2006

04:22.520 --> 04:25.320
I think he made the history
of Italian football.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.240
I don't know if it was stranger
for me to play with him,

04:29.360 --> 04:31.920
or for him to play with me.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.080
Time passed.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.720
Generations passed,
but he remains a myth.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.920
Gigi will manage to play
with my children as well.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.040
I remember... Will I?

04:44.120 --> 04:48.240
There's a lot of respect between
the seniors and the young players.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.560
Me, Kulu, McKennie,

04:50.640 --> 04:52.920
even the ones from the youth team

04:53.000 --> 04:55.720
that never played
are all treated as Juventus players.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.080
For that game, he has to give it all
and has the responsibility

04:59.160 --> 05:02.360
to give it all for the fans and the club.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.240
With the captain out,

05:05.360 --> 05:09.360
the young players are missing
an important reference point

05:09.440 --> 05:12.240
for mentality and determination.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.360
-Saved and goal! It's a goal!
-Come on, let's play.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.240
Juventus draws three games in a row

05:20.320 --> 05:23.040
against teams
that are traditionally less competitive.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.080
Simy against Buffon,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.320
Simy shoots and it's a goal!
Crotone is up.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.280
Zaccagno, he sees Favilli inside,
the shot! It's a goal. Verona is up.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.520
After five games,
the team is fifth in the standings.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.800
The first results are not encouraging,

05:53.880 --> 05:57.720
and the Italian press does not refrain
from criticizing the new coach.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.480
Pirlo discusses how to face
this criticism with the management.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.840
Juve are worried about making mistakes,
so they're unable to be innovative.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.360
This is at the beginning of the week,

06:13.440 --> 06:16.120
and today it says
that we're an old team,

06:16.200 --> 06:20.480
with a very young midfield
and a variable offense.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.160
-The problem...
-What do they want?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.480
Exactly, because I don't understand...

06:24.560 --> 06:25.960
I want you to notice that...

06:26.040 --> 06:27.520
The criticism was made...

06:27.600 --> 06:30.600
-A childish act of arrogance.
-A childish act of arrogance.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.760
The arrogance of playing sometimes
with four, if not five offensive players.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.680
Yes, of course.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.600
-Yes, for him--
-Did we lose?

06:37.680 --> 06:40.440
-No. For him this is a childish--
-Exactly, plus...

06:40.520 --> 06:44.280
I'm used to it anyway, they have been
breaking my balls for 40 years.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.120
Wow!

06:47.680 --> 06:48.560
Well...

06:48.640 --> 06:52.240
Go! Go, go, go.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.320
To prove himself a player
deserving of Juventus,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.640
Weston McKennie is focusing closely
on his physical conditions.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.400
NUTRITIONIST
ENTER ONE AT THE TIME

07:03.480 --> 07:06.840
-Hi, Wes. How are you?
-Why me?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.680
-Weight check?
-Yes.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.000
-It's point two.
-Yeah.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.680
Do not... the line...

07:19.760 --> 07:21.280
Eighty-five point three.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.400
It's good?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.960
We can say
that you're slightly overweight.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.640
The percentage of body fat is 18%.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.040
Not ashamed to say, when I first came,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.760
I was, thinking I had 18% body fat...

07:35.840 --> 07:37.320
WESTON MCKENNIE
MIDFIELDER

07:37.400 --> 07:43.320
...and, were like, "Okay, you're
definitely gonna have to change that."

07:44.480 --> 07:49.120
But you know, they found me a chef.
I now, I have a meal plan.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.720
Is he losing weight?

07:50.800 --> 07:54.880
It's important to lose the weight slowly.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.080
Yeah. I can do better.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.440
You're a winner!

07:59.520 --> 08:00.840
What's more important?

08:00.920 --> 08:03.240
Wanting to win
every game and training.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.400
-Are you there?
-Yeah.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.560
Good.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.560
Did you like the Italian diet?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.800
Yeah. I miss the American burgers.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.440
I do miss that. Some chicken wings,

08:21.240 --> 08:23.200
some fried chicken,

08:25.360 --> 08:26.400
some donuts.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.440
Only vegetable. Yeah. Fish.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.880
Wes likes to joke around

08:38.000 --> 08:40.320
and so, obviously, for his age.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
I got--

08:44.520 --> 08:47.160
But he has great potential.

08:48.360 --> 08:53.040
Here at Juventus,
he'll learn to be professional a 100%.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.160
Luckily for him, he can rely
on the player who, more than anyone,

09:00.240 --> 09:03.120
made a real cult
out of caring for his body.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.880
The care for every detail of his nutrition

09:10.960 --> 09:15.000
is part of the secret
of Cristiano Ronaldo's sports longevity.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.440
Food, what you eat,
for me it's not sacrifice.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.640
To eat, I don't know, tuna fish,
or broccoli. I do, because I like.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.160
And for me, it's natural because I start--
I become to do this

09:29.240 --> 09:32.240
when I was 18, 19, 20s.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.640
Cristiano Ronaldo cannot only
teach things about nutrition.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.320
-What are you trying to do?
-Wanna see?

09:52.400 --> 09:54.520
I don't even know how the--

09:55.760 --> 09:58.640
-This goes around like this...
-Like that, back.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.880
-Then back around like...
-Back with this one.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.600
You put up, this one. Turn, turn this leg.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.440
And then touch with this one.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.120
-So it goes around like this...
-And touch... Yes.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.520
...that, bro!

10:12.720 --> 10:13.760
Nice, Álva.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.080
Very good. Very good.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.000
But...

10:25.640 --> 10:28.120
Captain Chiellini, who can't play

10:28.200 --> 10:30.960
due to annoying physical problems,

10:31.040 --> 10:33.960
remains an example for new players,
Chiesa and McKennie,

10:34.040 --> 10:36.840
both in and off the field.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.120
Hi, Mauri.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.120
Hi, Giorgio. Ready to sign?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.360
Thank you very much.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.240
I'm gonna help you. We'll be quick.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.480
Are these the jerseys
you give to the kids?

10:48.520 --> 10:51.200
Yes, yes. I'll train with them today.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.000
You've been going for years now.

10:53.080 --> 10:58.160
I am one of the co-founders
of the association, some ten years ago.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.480
Football helps you
also to relate to others.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.240
That is what's great.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.880
These kids are full of energy.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.360
I've spent a lot of time...

11:13.440 --> 11:14.280
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

11:14.400 --> 11:17.840
...with them over the years,
and they're very special.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.520
-Hi, guys.
-Hey!

11:20.600 --> 11:22.400
-It's been a while.
-Yeah!

11:22.480 --> 11:25.360
-It's nice to see you.
-For me too, Giò, for me too.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.160
I missed you a lot in this period.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.480
I know, Giorgio!

11:29.560 --> 11:31.680
No! You brought the book, Nick?

11:32.320 --> 11:36.000
The happiness
I can give them fills my heart.

11:36.080 --> 11:41.080
They have an inner strength
that allows them to overcome

11:41.160 --> 11:44.120
their disability with great energy.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.880
Nice!

11:46.960 --> 11:49.800
Now, look. You get here
with the outside of your foot.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.200
You control the ball. Look. And pass it.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.440
Hiya!

11:55.920 --> 11:59.040
When I broke my knee
and a very bad period started for me,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.800
some of these kids

12:00.880 --> 12:05.240
were the first to send me a video message,
saying, "Now you're one of us",

12:05.320 --> 12:06.760
because I had the crutches.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.640
"Go, Giorgione, we love you."

12:10.480 --> 12:12.600
-Is it for me?
-Yes.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.720
Thank you, Giorgio!

12:13.800 --> 12:15.120
Have a good training.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.120
-Edo! Bye, Nick.
-Come here.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.920
What did he give you?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.120
A Juventus jersey.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.600
Amazing, Fabio!

12:24.640 --> 12:25.720
Amazing!

12:25.800 --> 12:27.120
This is a small gift.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.080
Thank you.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.000
Andrè.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.600
It's a gift to see you
finally on the field.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.280
Let's applaud.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.520
Thank you.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.320
Thank you.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.520
-See, guys, it's my pleasure.
-Thank you.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.640
I love you.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.440
The newly arrived Chiesa is getting
to know the new environment

12:59.520 --> 13:03.520
and learning
how a Juventus player should behave.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.880
Who knew, when? Just like that?

13:10.680 --> 13:14.720
When I arrived, Leo has been
the first to tell me how to behave.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.760
FEDERICO CHIESA
STRIKER

13:15.840 --> 13:19.200
-It's not compulsory to speak at lunch.
-What?

13:19.280 --> 13:21.200
It's not compulsory to speak at lunch.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.440
I knew you'd attack me. Sooner or later.
It's not compulsory to speak at lunch.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.120
Leo... Leo is tough.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.320
Yes, but don't be like that, Leo.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.560
I didn't tell you anything.
You sat there and attacked me.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.200
I was talking to him.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
Okay.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.840
We seniors must be an example...

13:41.920 --> 13:42.920
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

13:43.000 --> 13:47.080
...and protect the younger players,
try to stimulate them when they need it.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.480
It's what we older players do.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.560
Buffon, Cristiano, Giorgio...

13:58.120 --> 13:59.720
With Chiellini injured,

13:59.800 --> 14:03.280
the duties of the captain are all
on Leonardo Bonucci's shoulders.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.800
-Fine. How was school?
-Good.

14:07.640 --> 14:12.440
The role of captain
and that of father have things in common.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.720
The responsibilities
are always many and big.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.960
You must be an example,

14:19.040 --> 14:23.560
have a positive influence
on the character of your kids,

14:23.640 --> 14:26.160
like that of your teammates.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.320
When you first become a father,
some are ready, some are not.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.440
My wife and I discussed
a lot in the first few months.

14:34.520 --> 14:40.200
When you must make a decision by yourself,

14:41.200 --> 14:43.200
you can think in a certain way,

14:43.280 --> 14:44.760
even less mature ways,

14:44.840 --> 14:48.080
because ultimately
you're the only one who's responsible.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.320
When you, when you have a family,
you must make

14:52.400 --> 14:56.040
decisions based
on the situation in the family,

14:56.120 --> 14:58.600
on what is best for the family.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.720
The moment when you realize
that and your life changes.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.920
Now I'm a different man
and a different father.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.320
In Champions League,
after the brilliant victory in Kiev,

15:15.400 --> 15:19.600
Pirlo is now facing an even bigger match,
that against Barcelona.

15:20.560 --> 15:24.680
Juve-Barcelona really
is an extraordinary game

15:24.760 --> 15:28.000
both for history and to check
the quality of the two teams.

15:28.080 --> 15:32.400
Two great teams
that are going through a reformation,

15:32.480 --> 15:35.160
with new faces
on the bench and on the field.

15:36.720 --> 15:41.080
It's also a test of maturity,
I think, for these kids.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.600
We must face this year as a challenge.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

15:48.600 --> 15:53.040
To this, we must always add the dream
that every Juventus fan has since 1996.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.520
Wait, the shot. It's a goal!

15:55.600 --> 15:57.040
JUVENTUS - AJAX
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 1996

15:57.120 --> 16:02.960
It's that of trying to go all the way,
and win the Champions League.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.960
The Champions League is the dream.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.200
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

16:07.280 --> 16:11.240
We know we have the quality
to go all the way.

16:11.320 --> 16:16.120
The group is united, it's strong,
and to win would be further strength

16:16.880 --> 16:19.800
to Juventus both as a club and as a team.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.720
Juventus are the champions of Europe!

16:28.600 --> 16:31.480
But the many young,
less experienced, players

16:31.560 --> 16:34.200
in the team may feel
the pressure of the game.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.640
The young players may not be used...

16:36.720 --> 16:37.720
ANDREA PIRLO
COACH - 1st TEAM HEAD COACH

16:37.800 --> 16:42.120
...to play such games, especially so many
important games in such a short time.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.880
This is when the more
experienced players help you,

16:45.960 --> 16:49.640
with words and example on the field,
and also with their behavior.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.560
Cristiano Ronaldo
has tested positive for COVID.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.640
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

17:00.720 --> 17:04.120
Obviously, the news has met much interest.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.080
14 OCTOBER 2020
2 WEEKS BEFORE THE MATCH AGAINST BARCELONA

17:06.160 --> 17:10.960
Ronaldo has tested positive for COVID.
He is in isolation and is asymptomatic.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.560
It has been announced
by the Portuguese Federation

17:13.680 --> 17:15.920
a few hours before
the match against Sweden.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.200
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner,
Cristiano Ronaldo

17:19.280 --> 17:23.080
is likely to miss
the next two matches for Juventus as well.

17:26.880 --> 17:32.800
The coincidence is Ronaldo's positivity
and his fight to test negative

17:32.920 --> 17:35.640
before the most important match

17:35.720 --> 17:40.080
of this part of the season.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.800
It's the news everyone
wants to read tomorrow.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.040
Ronaldo and Messi haven't played
against each other for over two years.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.800
Last time Ronaldo was wearing
the Real Madrid jersey.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.040
This time he will wear
the Juventus jersey,

17:54.080 --> 17:57.320
so the match would have
world importance if they're both there.

17:57.440 --> 18:02.320
Before sending the newspaper to print,
Vaciago asks a source close to Juventus.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.880
Do you know anything about Ronaldo?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.160
That he won't play...

18:08.240 --> 18:09.160
Yes, yes.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.800
Tomorrow, Juventus will be much weaker,

18:12.880 --> 18:16.320
since Cristiano Ronaldo
is the man that in Champions League

18:16.400 --> 18:20.440
is always the one who makes a difference,
especially in important games.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.560
CR7 WON'T PLAY, IT'S KULUSI'S NIGHT
PIRLO, "WILL AND STRENGTH"

18:23.640 --> 18:26.080
TURIN
OCTOBER 28, 2020

18:26.160 --> 18:30.720
In the last 50 years, the two teams,
two of the best teams that won in Europe,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.160
met 13 times
in international competitions.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.800
The balance is five wins for Juventus,

18:36.920 --> 18:39.800
four for Barcelona, and four draws.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.760
Tonight, Juventus have their problems.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.080
They're in a transitional period
and the absence of Ronaldo, is a big deal.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.720
Juventus enters the field
by deploying a remodeled formation.

18:52.800 --> 18:57.640
The seniors must instill bravery
and determination to the younger players.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Let's go, let's go!

19:05.080 --> 19:09.560
The ball is in the box. The header.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.960
Juventus does not kick it away.
A post by Griezmann.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.160
A risk for Juventus

19:15.240 --> 19:17.760
after two minutes,
with the chance for Griezmann.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.760
Just a few minutes...

19:19.800 --> 19:22.440
The shot. And it's a goal.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.800
And it all goes
downhill for the Bianconeri.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.720
Barcelona is up
with Dembélé, at minute 14.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.080
Now it's all uphill for Juventus.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.680
Go, Dembé, go, go.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.440
Move it quicker.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.240
There's not much time
to wait for Juventus' reaction.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.480
Juventus tries
to attack with Juan Cuadrado.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.880
Inside to Álvaro Morata,
he faces the keeper.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.480
Morata, Morata.
The ball stays there. Morata!

19:50.800 --> 19:52.760
Juventus levels.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.880
But the lineman signals an offside.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.000
The goal is disallowed.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.080
Again? No!

20:04.080 --> 20:05.040
Go, Fede!

20:05.080 --> 20:06.680
But Juventus does not give up.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.920
Cuadrado looks in, his cross for Morata!

20:09.000 --> 20:11.080
He scores. Álvaro Morata.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.960
But it's still offside.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.040
Morata is on fire, and leads
again the team on the offense.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.320
Inside, the ball is deflected.
Wait, Morata!

20:22.400 --> 20:25.200
This time, Álvaro Morata's goal is good.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.080
One-one the score. Minute 55.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.080
VAR, offside.

20:31.160 --> 20:35.080
Incredible. Third goal disallowed
to Álvaro Morata.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.720
Barcelona's goal

20:36.800 --> 20:38.480
seems cursed.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.080
Let's keep the ball!

20:43.080 --> 20:47.800
Messi, Messi, the ball inside
for Ansu Fati, touched by Bernardeschi.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.800
Penalty for Barcelona.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.680
The game ends here.
Juventus nil, Barcelona two.

21:04.760 --> 21:09.200
Change, in everything, comes with risk.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.880
Whether they're risks
that are worth taking,

21:11.960 --> 21:17.240
because they'll lead us to great results,
only time will tell.

21:17.320 --> 21:22.240
JUVENTUS 0 - 2 BARCELONA

21:29.280 --> 21:32.640
Against Barcelona, it was a tough lesson,

21:32.720 --> 21:35.720
and I don't think it's going well.

21:37.560 --> 21:41.680
The level, right now,
is the one we saw yesterday.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.080
It's a team full of doubts.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.080
You can see signs of what it could be,
but isn't yet.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.440
The team give everything.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.680
Unfortunately, we didn't get the result
that we expect.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.600
CRISTIANO RONALDO
STRIKER

22:00.680 --> 22:01.800
But this is football.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.080
I wasn't in the game but I wasn't upset.

22:08.440 --> 22:13.480
It is good to be back to help the team,
which is the most important in my opinion,

22:13.560 --> 22:15.240
and be a good teammate.

22:18.560 --> 22:22.320
Barcelona is the past now.
We're gonna be tough and difficult.

22:27.680 --> 22:33.440
Juve, Juve, Juve, Juve, Juve, Juve, Juve!

22:33.520 --> 22:37.920
In the following month,
Juventus plays four games, winning two.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.120
Ronaldo!

22:40.240 --> 22:43.800
He's devastating
three minutes after coming in.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.560
Against Spezia and Cagliari...

22:45.640 --> 22:46.760
Ronaldo!

22:46.840 --> 22:48.600
Juventus is up!

22:49.240 --> 22:51.920
And drawing two,
against Lazio and Benevento.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.560
The shot and it's a goal. Lazio levels.
It's over, at minute 94.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.680
-Shoot the ball!
-The shot...

22:58.760 --> 23:00.240
That ties it up, 1-1.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.040
In the high end of the standings,
but without taking the lead.

23:13.600 --> 23:18.280
In the beginning of December, Juventus
faces one of its most important matches.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.480
the so-called Derby della Mole
against Torino.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.800
An event that lights up the rivalry
between the two groups of supporters.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.160
GIGI MERONI STAR OF FOOTBALL
GRANATA AND NATIONAL 1943 1967

23:29.240 --> 23:31.080
Torino has a glorious history.

23:31.160 --> 23:37.120
At the end of the 1930s, they built a team
that was a sort of dream team,

23:37.200 --> 23:41.760
the so-called "Grande Torino" is
comparable to Real Madrid of Galacticos...

23:41.840 --> 23:42.960
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST OF TUTTOSPORT

23:43.040 --> 23:48.400
...or that of the United
in the Champions League.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.880
That Torino won five consecutive titles

23:51.960 --> 23:56.400
and was the best team in the world,
almost unbeatable for Juventus.

24:00.960 --> 24:05.440
We grew also as a family
with this city around.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.200
Look, who's there? Your friend.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.160
TORINO MAGAZINE
METROPOLITAN CAPTAINS

24:09.240 --> 24:10.600
Your friend Gallo.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.880
Is he your idol?

24:13.760 --> 24:17.840
Matteo is a Juventus fan.
Lorenzo likes Belotti, he's a Torino fan.

24:19.920 --> 24:25.040
With the arrival of Cristiano to Juventus,
he started to support Juventus a bit.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.600
Bonucci and Belotti
became friends for a fun reason.

24:28.680 --> 24:34.560
One of Bonucci's sons, who supports
Torino, wanted Belotti's jersey.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.880
Bonucci asked Belotti,
and let his son wear it,

24:38.960 --> 24:44.080
and posted a very nice photo with one
of his sons with the Juventus jersey

24:44.160 --> 24:46.160
and the other with the Torino one.

24:46.240 --> 24:51.720
At that moment,
the acrimony of the derby dissipated,

24:51.800 --> 24:55.960
and the friendship between
the two national teammates began,

24:56.040 --> 24:58.200
and it's a beautiful story of the derby.

25:02.400 --> 25:07.720
On the eve of the derby, Juventus is fifth
in the standings, six points behind Milan.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.880
Ready, ready. Adri, inside.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.080
Pirlo must do something to change things.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.640
Good, good!

25:13.720 --> 25:17.120
The work, during training,
is focused on the younger players.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.960
If you're too tight diagonally with him,
they'll get in.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.760
One striker must be ready to get closer

25:24.840 --> 25:28.840
and Wes should get in.
Let's get one of the center-backs out.

25:31.080 --> 25:35.560
I feel the pressure more than
any other club I played at just because...

25:35.640 --> 25:36.480
WESTON MCKENNIE
MIDFIELDER

25:36.560 --> 25:39.520
...it's Juventus, you know?
It's expected to win.

25:41.560 --> 25:46.840
You have world-class players that you play
next to, that are on the bench as well.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.200
Good.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.400
If I play a great game,

25:50.480 --> 25:54.320
maybe I have a good opportunity
for starting the next game.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.360
But it's not necessarily a secure spot.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.760
Come, Wes. Wes. Good, good.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.440
It's the morning
of the long-awaited derby,

26:07.520 --> 26:09.760
and the city is getting
ready for the match.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.680
Oh, God, God!

26:13.760 --> 26:16.840
The derby is tonight,
the mass is at 6:00,

26:16.920 --> 26:19.880
so remember the derby miracle.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.880
MARY QUEEN OF PEACE PARISH

26:28.200 --> 26:30.240
DON GIULIANO
JUVENTUS FAN

26:30.320 --> 26:33.000
...because the sides are very marked.

26:33.080 --> 26:38.320
Me, Don Luca, and Carla, our consecrated
lay sister are Juventus fans.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.480
Look how nice you look with this one.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.800
Good. Right? Beautiful.

26:43.160 --> 26:48.400
And on the other side, Don Stefano
has a big flaw. His football faith.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.200
You're here?

26:52.280 --> 26:56.160
When Carla and Don Stefano,
who's a Torino fan, tease each other,

26:56.240 --> 26:59.280
because in that moment,
she forgets he is a priest...

26:59.360 --> 27:00.360
DON LUCA
JUVENTUS FAN

27:00.440 --> 27:02.320
...and speaks bluntly to him.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.920
I told you already
that this is the original sin.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.200
The arrogance,
only because you're slightly richer.

27:11.280 --> 27:14.720
No, it's not the money.
It's the players that are good...

27:14.800 --> 27:19.040
-Of course.
-...so they work hard,

27:19.120 --> 27:21.760
they have to spit venom
on the field to win always.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.480
Juventus certainly spits venom,

27:24.560 --> 27:28.000
it's better than herbicide.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.520
TURIN
DECEMBER 5, 2020

27:32.600 --> 27:34.920
Tonight the city
is at the edge of its seat.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.400
The most important match
of the year is about to start.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.000
Juve on the field with Szczęsny,
then Cuadrado.

27:44.080 --> 27:44.920
ENRICO ZAMBRUNO
COMMENTATOR

27:45.040 --> 27:47.920
On the left. Danilo.
At the center, Bonucci and De Ligt.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.680
In the midfield, Arthur and Rabiot.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.680
On the wings, Kulusevski and Chiesa.
In front, CR7 with Paulo Dybala.

27:56.400 --> 28:01.160
Paulo Dybala. Paulo Dybala.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.080
Four, four, two for...

28:08.720 --> 28:12.800
Four, four, two for the team coached
by Pirlo and so with Szczęsny in goal.

28:12.880 --> 28:16.840
Defense with four players,
from the left Cuadrado, De Ligt, Bonucci,

28:16.920 --> 28:21.720
CR7, Cristiano Ronaldo.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.880
Cristiano Ronaldo.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.920
And we're at the stadium.
Derby della Mole.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.400
With Chiellini on the bench,
the captain's armband goes to Bonucci.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.520
It'll be his job to lead his young
teammates to win the derby.

28:47.080 --> 28:51.720
It begins! Enjoy, Juventus-Torino.
We start with a shot

28:51.800 --> 28:53.840
from sidereal distance.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.440
Central, Cri.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.880
Come on, go, go, it's ours.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.320
Dangerous cross...

29:01.400 --> 29:05.720
Torino is aggressive from the get-go
and dangerously attacks Juventus' goal.

29:05.800 --> 29:10.880
Cross to the center. Headed by De Ligt.
It's going to be a corner.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.560
De Ligt is good.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.280
Bonucci doesn't reassure me.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.440
It's ours!

29:19.520 --> 29:21.360
Go, go, quick!

29:21.440 --> 29:24.880
Ansaldi is ready to cross,
the ball is deflected.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.640
The ball is in.
Torino's up with the goal by Nkoulou.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.760
Torino's goal, after only nine minutes,

29:33.840 --> 29:37.560
leaves the Juventus bench
and all fans incredulous.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.920
Damn, guys.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.160
I am speechless.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.160
The match didn't start well for Juventus.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.120
Go, Fede! Fede!

29:49.200 --> 29:54.400
Ball to Ronaldo.
Intercepted by Lyanco. Belotti.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.000
Go, go, go!

29:56.080 --> 29:59.720
Belotti keeps it on the ground
for Zaza, he's onside. Zaza shoots.

29:59.800 --> 30:03.960
Szczęsny saves it.
Great save by Szczęsny, who says no.

30:06.280 --> 30:11.280
Juventus did not find
their way into the match yet.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.160
Gianlu, Gianlu! It's the fifth, Gianlu!

30:14.240 --> 30:18.600
Bonucci struggles to lead
the new players in building the maneuver.

30:18.680 --> 30:23.040
Chiesa still not in the game and Torino
takes advantage of the situation.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.720
Go, Adri, go, Adri!

30:24.800 --> 30:28.840
Ball to Zaza. Triangle for Ansaldi.
Ansaldi inside the box, Ansaldi.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.840
He crosses towards Belotti,
the shot is over the bar.

30:38.760 --> 30:43.280
The referee blows the whistle.
Juventus nil, Torino one.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.480
With this result,

30:48.560 --> 30:53.200
Pirlo will have to shake the team,
as he used to do as a player.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.440
Chiellini, as a captain
off the field, is ready to help.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.960
Come on, relax. Let's find some energy,
let's play a great second half,

31:02.320 --> 31:06.320
and let's win. Relaxed, heads up.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.480
We need a stroke of genius from the master
who will invent something.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.120
The coach must give something
at halftime, or else...

31:16.360 --> 31:19.480
We must be patient,
the ball is moving too slow

31:19.560 --> 31:22.200
and we can never find the free player.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.800
If we're slow,
we can never get there first,

31:24.880 --> 31:27.560
because their half-wingers
have time to come out.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.160
Let's move the ball freely,
attack the space.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.120
They'll jump on us
if we come all towards the ball.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.720
All the balls we freed here
can only be played on the wings.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.240
Let's play fast, come on!

31:38.320 --> 31:41.960
They play on our counterattacks
and our missed passes.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.480
Let's try to make
fewer mistakes and play faster.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.000
We'll score, let's attack their box.

31:47.080 --> 31:50.520
Cross on the other side.
Get into the box. You're always late.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.800
If you get into the box we'll score.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.640
If no one is inside,
only Cristiano and Paulo, it's not enough.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.160
Come on, come on.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.840
Let's focus! You must want it!
You must want to win it, eh?

32:01.920 --> 32:06.200
-We need to want the victory!
-Let's go!

32:06.960 --> 32:08.360
Yes.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.160
Go, Leo! Go, Leo, come on!

32:11.240 --> 32:15.920
We must find the play
that changes our match.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.520
Come, Carla, come, come.
We're not going well. It's bad.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.240
Come on, don't worry. For one goal...
You'll see that we'll draw. Now.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.800
Come, come, Carla!

32:26.440 --> 32:30.400
Don't foul, don't foul,
don't let it get out! Well done!

32:31.400 --> 32:35.000
It's a new Juventus that launches
a constant pressing...

32:35.080 --> 32:36.840
Corner kick for Juventus.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
...that soon bears fruit.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.880
Cross inside, there's Cuadrado,

32:43.960 --> 32:47.120
Cuadrado with his right foot

32:47.200 --> 32:50.880
and the ball is in the net!

32:54.640 --> 32:58.120
One-one! Great shot
by Juan Cuadrado in the corner!

32:58.200 --> 33:01.960
He's a Catholic, Cuadrado is good.
He's a good kid. Colombian.

33:03.720 --> 33:08.720
The lineman signals a possible offside.
The referee requests VAR.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.920
Oh, no.

33:15.360 --> 33:19.480
An eventual offside
with Leonardo Bonucci's presence.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.280
So, it's not a goal.

33:21.360 --> 33:25.720
Offside position for Leonardo Bonucci,
so we must start again.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.840
Alex for Danilo, Wes for Rabiot.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.480
In order to shake the match,
it's the moment of brave choices.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.320
Pirlo decides to trust his young players.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.040
Weston McKennie takes the place of Rabiot.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.880
Then to Ronaldo. Then to Paulo Dybala.
Dybala inside for Chiesa.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.920
Chiesa. Chiesa shoots. Sirigu saves.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.200
Corner kick to Juventus.

33:54.280 --> 33:58.360
Chiesa is finally in the zone
and earns a precious corner kick.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.000
From this position,
Juventus can be dangerous.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.080
Juan Cuadrado crosses

34:07.160 --> 34:09.840
towards McKennie, and Juventus levels.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.560
This is McKennie.
It's the first goal of the American player

34:20.640 --> 34:23.040
with the Juventus jersey. 1-1.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.040
One, one, one.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.320
Another one, Don.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.160
Juventus took courage and are attacking.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.040
Look at Aaron, Aaron is coming. Go, Aaron.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.640
To McKennie, and then Dybala.

34:40.160 --> 34:44.040
What a chance for Juventus,
incredible save.

34:45.160 --> 34:49.400
Time is ticking relentlessly,
only a few minutes to the end of the game

34:49.480 --> 34:52.840
and Juventus can't break the deadlock.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.320
This is when you see
the strength of a team leader.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.760
It's time to show the strength
of the Italian Champions.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.040
The cross, wait! Bonucci!
Bonucci! Now Juve is up.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.760
Bonucci! Juventus takes the lead!

35:17.520 --> 35:20.120
Bonucci! Bonucci!

35:26.080 --> 35:31.080
The match ends here.
Juventus beats Toro 2-1. Great derby!

35:32.120 --> 35:34.680
Go Juventus!

35:35.640 --> 35:37.280
Well done!

35:44.960 --> 35:46.400
A theft!

35:49.400 --> 35:52.760
-Marco!
-So cool! So cool!

35:52.840 --> 35:55.440
All right, guys!

36:05.160 --> 36:07.440
The experience
and the class of the veterans,

36:07.520 --> 36:09.600
together with the enthusiasm and the grit

36:09.640 --> 36:12.120
-of the young players paid off.
-Come on!

36:12.160 --> 36:14.520
If there's no dedication,
you can't win games.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.920
This was and will be useful in the future.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
ANDREA PIRLO
COACH - 1ST TEAM HEAD COACH

36:23.160 --> 36:24.360
Go, Alvarito!

36:25.680 --> 36:29.840
To win the Champions League,
you have to have the eleven players.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.800
Let's put the defender
that goes high on Messi.

36:33.880 --> 36:38.640
I think I can still play those matches
and play them well.

36:38.680 --> 36:43.200
Messi! Buffon saves it!
McKennie, second goal for Juventus!

36:45.560 --> 36:47.760
Let's go get these three points.
