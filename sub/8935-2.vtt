idea. Try that, Mr. Sneer.

10:23.589 --> 10:27.259
Well, there is
money, and gold, and stocks.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.630
Bonds are nice too and,
corporate takeovers.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.532
Nurse Peck: Mr. Sneer,
if you're quite finished,

10:33.532 --> 10:36.035
I think it's time
we all got some rest.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.904
Ha! Nothing to it.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.607
I told you I'm an expert
on this hospital stuff.

10:41.607 --> 10:45.211
Well, Mr. Expert, try
turning that harmonica around

10:45.211 --> 10:46.979
and it'll sound a lot better.

didn't know what
they were doing.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.939
Sorry Bert, but
I've done all I can.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.108
Thanks for trying
anyway, Schaeffer.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.209
Good news, Bert!

12:57.209 --> 12:59.044
I got the name of the
president of the company

12:59.044 --> 13:00.846
that sells the remote bomber.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.115
And from everything we
could find out about this guy,

13:03.115 --> 13:04.784
he's a real weasel!

13:04.784 --> 13:06.919
His name is Milton Midas.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.621
Mr. Midas: ..Milton Midas here,
your man of a million

13:08.621 --> 13:10.222
miraculous Midas deals!

13:10.222 --> 13:12.391
This fabulous Midas forest has
just become available

13:12.391 --> 13:13.826
and it's gotta go, friends!

13:13.826 --> 13:15.628
Take a look at the
Midas workmanship

13:15.628 --> 13:17.062
on these Midas trees.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.566
Solid Midas wood. So run,
walk, or crawl on down here

13:20.566 --> 13:24.603
tomorrow for the auctioning off
of these incredible Midas acres!

13:24.603 --> 13:28.073
Just who am I to be offering you
such a dynamite Midas deal?

13:28.073 --> 13:31.076
Well, I'm the man with
the golden touch.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.779
Mr. Milton Midas.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.948
Milton Midas?

13:35.948 --> 13:38.284
I know, isn't
television great?

13:38.284 --> 13:42.054
The man with the gold
touch.. Mr. Milton Midas!

13:42.955 --> 13:47.493
Pig 1: Oh no. We forgot
to close the land deal!

13:47.493 --> 13:49.595
Pig 3: Madcap millionaires!

13:49.595 --> 13:51.997
The party's not over!

13:52.898 --> 13:56.669
Pig 2: Oh, the party's
over, alright!

13:56.669 --> 13:59.171
Pig 1: Never mind our lives.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.273
Pig 3: Oh, golly gosh gee whiz.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.843
Have I missed something?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.579
Nurse Peck: I'm a
bit worried about him.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.480
How is he doing doctor?

14:08.480 --> 14:11.183
Doctor Canard: Well, I've gone
through his test results

14:11.183 --> 14:14.086
and he's going to
need an operation.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.689
An operation!

14:22.962 --> 14:25.764
Mr. Sneer,
what are you doing?

14:25.764 --> 14:27.800
I'm checking out.
Why?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.436
Because they want to
operate on me, that's why.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.371
Are you chicken?

14:32.371 --> 14:34.340
Listen kid,
do you have any idea

14:34.340 --> 14:36.175
what those doctors do to you?

14:36.175 --> 14:39.345
Oh sure, I've
had operations before.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.180
You have?

14:41.180 --> 14:43.382
Yeah, and
they're not all that bad.

14:43.382 --> 14:47.052
Well, the first time
is always a bit scary.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.355
I guess, I wasn't
that brave, but...

14:49.355 --> 14:50.990
Aaahh!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.894
If you're brave enough
to climb out there,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.563
you're brave enough
to handle an operation.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.964
Trust me!

15:00.699 --> 15:03.168
Pig 1: Oh, Mr. Midas?

15:03.168 --> 15:05.337
We've come to sign the deal!

15:05.337 --> 15:06.839
Kids, haha.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.375
Ah, you must be history buffs,

15:09.375 --> 15:11.911
'cause that deal
is an ancient event.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.813
Pig 3: Our boss
gave us carte blanche

15:14.813 --> 15:17.116
and maybe we could
throw in the pens,

15:17.116 --> 15:18.250
sort of like a bit of a...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.085
Kids, kids. Ha ha.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.321
Ah, you make me smile.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.822
I like to smile.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.759
So I'm going to make this
easy for you to understand.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.596
The original deal is off!

15:30.596 --> 15:33.766
Kids, ha ha, kids.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.202
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Milton Midas?

15:37.202 --> 15:38.237
What?

15:38.237 --> 15:40.372
I bought this plane
from your company, see,

15:40.372 --> 15:41.674
and it doesn't work.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.210
Listen here kiddo, I've
got an image to watch here.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.780
What you want is a
crash course in timing.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.950
Yeah well uh, I'll be
on my way juts as soon as

15:50.950 --> 15:53.719
I get my refund, like
it says here in your ad.

15:53.719 --> 15:58.023
Money cheerfully refunded,
if not completely satisfied!

15:58.023 --> 15:59.792
I said that?
That's right.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.627
Oh, imagine that.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.130
I must have left my
refund money at home,

16:05.130 --> 16:07.700
but I'm sure I can fix
that plane for you.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.769
Just a minor adjustment and it
should work like a charm.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.571
There, that should do it!

16:12.571 --> 16:15.908
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
an auction to get started.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.076
Kids...

16:18.077 --> 16:20.479
Doctor Canard: Aaah.
And how I everyone today?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.214
All ready to face an...

16:22.214 --> 16:23.282
An operation?

16:23.282 --> 16:25.150
Doctor Canard:
I was going to say

16:25.150 --> 16:28.587
ready to face another day,
Mr. Sneer.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.824
As far as I know, you're not
scheduled for any surgery.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.794
I do have the news on
your tests though and uh,

16:35.794 --> 16:38.263
you have an ulcer.
An ulcer!

16:38.263 --> 16:41.500
Doctor Canard: Yup. Now,
it can be caused by many things,

16:41.500 --> 16:45.004
but uh, in your case,
it seems to be stress.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.607
With a proper diet and a little
less tension in your life,

16:48.607 --> 16:51.610
that ulcer shouldn't cause you
any problems at all.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.445
You can go home.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.447
Home? Now? Great!

16:55.447 --> 16:57.649
Hey Danny, isn't that great?

16:57.649 --> 17:00.285
Yeah, sure.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.621
That's the kind
of news I like to hear!

17:02.621 --> 17:05.257
Now listen, you fix
this kid up fast

17:05.257 --> 17:07.026
and get him out of here too.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.595
Doctor Canard: Yes,
well that would be nice.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.163
Good bye, Mr. Sneer.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.364
Ciao, doc!

17:12.364 --> 17:16.502
Dr Canard: Now, Danny, I have to
talk to you for a moment.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.803
That's right friends,

17:17.803 --> 17:19.838
just ten more minutes
to Midas auction time

17:19.838 --> 17:21.974
and this Midas land
is gone gone gone!

17:21.974 --> 17:23.442
So grab those
golden credit cards

17:23.442 --> 17:25.411
and charge on down to Midasland!

17:25.411 --> 17:28.781
Midas! Why,
those idiotic oinkers!

17:28.781 --> 17:32.584
If I lose this land, I'll
fire them.. out of a cannon!

17:32.584 --> 17:34.720
Wait! My briefcase...

17:36.155 --> 17:37.890
Dr Canard: I'm sorry Danny but

17:37.890 --> 17:40.659
we've had to cancel
your operation.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.294
But I want to go home!

17:42.294 --> 17:44.630
Now long will I have
to wait this time?

17:44.630 --> 17:46.165
Doctor Canard:
I don't know Danny,

17:46.165 --> 17:48.033
it's the same old problem.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.069
The blood bank is low again.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.838
Nurse Peck: Are you feeling
okay, Mr. Sneer?

17:52.838 --> 17:55.007
You're an awful shade of pink.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.242
Yeah, I'm all right.

17:57.242 --> 18:02.181
Say a..what do you have to do
to give blood around here?

18:02.181 --> 18:04.583
Nurse Peck: Ah, it's
nothing. Just a teeny needle

18:04.583 --> 18:05.984
and bit of your time.

18:05.984 --> 18:08.187
Did you say... needle?

18:08.187 --> 18:10.656
I'll, I'll lose the land!

18:13.725 --> 18:15.794
Where do you hide this
blood bank anyway?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.164
Now, if everyone is ready
we'll get this show on the road.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.100
Who will start the bidding on
this premium piece of property?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.401
Do I hear ten thousand dollars?

18:22.401 --> 18:24.536
Excellent. Do I have 11?
Yes, I've got 11.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.405
Do I here 12? 12? 12.
I've got 12.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.941
Who'll make me 15? 15. Fabulous.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.443
Now, do I hear 20? 20.
Let's hear that 20.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.444
There's 20!

18:32.444 --> 18:34.179
Pig 2: Ohh, what's going on?

18:34.179 --> 18:37.049
Pig 3: Oooh,
do something, Lloyd.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.717
Pig 1: What can I do?

18:38.717 --> 18:41.453
Pig 2: Do what the boss
would do if he was here!

18:41.453 --> 18:44.890
Pig 3: He'd get real mad
if he were here.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.227
Pig 1: You're right. $2,000!

18:48.227 --> 18:50.596
Two, thousand?

18:50.596 --> 18:53.398
Ah hahaha. Someone
give that kid a shake.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.800
The train left
the station and he's

18:54.800 --> 18:56.869
still looking for his tickets.

18:56.869 --> 19:00.772
Pig 1: I'll show him.
Two million dollars!

19:00.772 --> 19:05.310
Two mi-mi-mi-million,
million d-d-dollars?

19:05.310 --> 19:08.614
Humph. Let's see if
this thing really is fixed.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.317
Hey!

19:13.385 --> 19:15.254
Oh my. It's out of control.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.557
Two m-million
dollars, once!

19:18.557 --> 19:21.126
Pig 1: My bid certainly
made an impression

19:21.126 --> 19:23.962
on that big shot, didn't it?

19:23.962 --> 19:25.998
Pig 2: Oh, it certainly did.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.835
And when the boss hears
about this, he'll impress us.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.738
Pig 3: Six feet into the ground.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.040
Two m-m-million dollars

19:35.040 --> 19:36.775
t-t-twice.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.812
Aaahhhh...

19:45.918 --> 19:47.186
Is everyone okay?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.620
I hope no one got hurt!

19:48.620 --> 19:51.523
Or, or.. or torn?

19:51.523 --> 19:55.294
Hey, this whole
thing is a setup!

19:55.294 --> 19:59.331
It's another Midas scam,
just like my bomber!

19:59.331 --> 20:01.099
Pig 2: It's all swamp land!

20:01.099 --> 20:03.936
Wait! This is
just ah, ah, em..look.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.804
I know my
timing could be off,

20:05.804 --> 20:09.374
but I'd like that refund now!

20:10.008 --> 20:12.878
Refund, schmefund kid.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.214
Here, take it and leave.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.648
Thank you!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.986
Nurse Peck: Oh. What are you
still doing here, Cedric?

20:20.986 --> 20:22.988
Just waiting for Pop.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.856
He heard Danny
was out of surgery

20:24.856 --> 20:27.259
and wanted to stop
by and say hello.

20:27.259 --> 20:30.028
Nurse Peck: Ah,
two miracles in one day.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.730
First your father gives blood,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.465
and now he's voluntarily

20:33.465 --> 20:35.200
listening to the lad's music.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.603
And that's the
way you blow a harp kid.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.972
Hey, that's not bad!

20:39.972 --> 20:43.742
Yeah, well I was just
worried about the next poor soul

20:43.742 --> 20:45.811
that has to listen
to all your squawking.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.546
To the
untrained ear,

20:47.546 --> 20:50.182
the music that came from the
hospital room that night

20:50.182 --> 20:51.750
might have sounded tuneless,

20:51.750 --> 20:55.087
but to Cyril and Danny,
there was no sweeter sound.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.889
For the two had formed a friendship,

20:57.889 --> 21:00.058
through the ultimate
gift of sharing.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.996
Land scam? Auction?

21:03.996 --> 21:07.366
Sneer Industries bid
two million dollars?!

21:07.366 --> 21:10.035
Were you meat heads
out of your minds?

21:10.035 --> 21:13.772
Pig 1: Heh he. It was just a
bluff to expose him, boss!

21:13.772 --> 21:15.707
Really! We knew all along

21:15.707 --> 21:17.175
the land was worthless.

21:17.175 --> 21:18.543
Oh you did, did you?

21:18.543 --> 21:22.614
Urg. Just what in tarnation
is this doing here?

21:22.614 --> 21:26.752
Pig 1: Um. We were planning a
welcome home party for you?

21:26.752 --> 21:28.253
Not very likely.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.057
Hello? No, this
isn't the butler.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.059
The madcap millionaires?

21:34.059 --> 21:36.461
Ask them when they're
having their next

21:36.461 --> 21:38.697
mansion shaking party?!

21:38.697 --> 21:39.798
Rrrr!!

21:39.798 --> 21:42.934
Pig 1: Careful think of your
stress level, boss!

21:42.934 --> 21:44.870
Pig 2: Oh yeah.
You don't want to end up

21:44.870 --> 21:46.872
back in the hospital. Heh-he!

21:46.872 --> 21:49.608
Hospitals don't
bother me anymore,

21:49.608 --> 21:51.076
but you clowns do.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.878
And when I get to
the bottom of this,

21:52.878 --> 21:55.013
that's just where you'll be!

21:55.013 --> 21:57.082
In the hospital!!

21:57.082 --> 22:00.319
