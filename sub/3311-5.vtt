WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:10.678
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.381
JOE. JOE.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.682
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.384
NICE OUTFIT.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.287
SO DO YOU DO THE "Y," THE
"M," THE "C" OR THE "A"?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.760
LAUGH, BURKE. GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.630
BUT I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO HOURS
DOING SOME VERY LABOR-INTENSIVE WORK.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.100
I JUST BUILT A CUSTOM,
FULLY TRICKED-OUT,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.502
FOUR-TIER SPICE RACK FOR YOU.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.338
WHICH I ASKED FOR WHEN?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.207
ALL RIGHT, IT WAS FOR ME,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.642
BUT YOU JUST PAID FOR IT.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.344
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
WHAT DID YOU DO,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.513
JUST VOTE "YES" ON EVERYTHING
AND CALL IT A DAY?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.449
I TEXTED LENNOX THAT I
HAD A BIG SURPRISE.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.718
REMEMBER THAT GREEN DAY CONCERT
THAT SOLD OUT IN SIX MINUTES?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.620
WELL, GUESS WHO
SCORED TWO TICKETS.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.688
FLOOR SEATS? HOW DID
YOU SWING THAT?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.557
WHAT? I'M A CITY
COUNCILWOMAN, OKAY?

00:56.590 --> 00:58.559
I'M A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.429
ALL RIGHT, I'M A
SEMI-IMPORTANT PERSON.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.532
FINE, I WON THEM ON THE RADIO.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.434
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF MY INTERNS
WON THEM ON THE RADIO

01:06.467 --> 01:08.236
AND SHE GAVE THEM TO ME.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.704
ALL RIGHT, I TOOK THEM FROM HER!

01:10.738 --> 01:12.706
SORRY I HAD TO BREAK
YOU DOWN LIKE THAT.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.475
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING
IN THE KITCHEN.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.679
WOW, NICE RACK.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.248
THANK YOU.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.650
I DON'T GET ALL OFFENDED, SEE?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.585
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.455
LENNOX JUST GAVE ME THIS.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
ALL RIGHT, I FOUND
IT IN THE CAR.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.226
ALL RIGHT, SHE SHOVED
IT IN THE ASHTRAY.

01:32.260 --> 01:36.096
ANNOYING THAT I DIDN'T START WITH
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED FIRST, ISN'T IT?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.666
IT'S FROM HER CHEMISTRY TEACHER.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.568
"UNREALIZED POTENTIAL;

01:40.601 --> 01:43.771
NEEDS PARENTAL GUIDANCE;
DANGER OF FAILING"?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.606
WOW, IF THIS SAID
"FORGETS TO WEAR A BRA,"

01:45.639 --> 01:48.276
IT WOULD BE LIKE DEJA VU
OF ME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.445
SHE NEEDS TO GET A
"B" ON HER NEXT EXAM

01:51.479 --> 01:53.347
AND EVERY EXAM AFTER
THAT JUST TO PASS.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.450
SO I HAVE TO HELP HER STUDY?
OH NO.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.719
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T RETAIN A LOT
OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY?

01:58.752 --> 02:02.190
NO, I DID... NEVER
MIX BEER AND VODKA.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.360
OKAY, I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO:

02:06.394 --> 02:08.162
I HAVE TO COME DOWN HARD ON HER

02:08.196 --> 02:09.630
RIGHT AFTER THAT CONCERT
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.533
THE MONDAY NIGHT BEFORE
THE TUESDAY EXAM?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.435
YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.304
OH, THAT WAS YOUR POINT.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.640
OH, COME ON, LET ME BE FUN AUNT MEL.
EVERYBODY LOVES FUN AUNT MEL.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.643
YEAH, FUN AUNT MEL. ISN'T SHE RELATED
TO THE DROP-OUT PREGNANT NIECE?

02:22.676 --> 02:26.814
AUNT MEL, I GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT'S THE BIG SURPRISE?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.149
UH, IT'S... WELL,

02:29.183 --> 02:31.385
SEE, SOME OF THE
SURPRISE IS GOOD

02:31.419 --> 02:33.687
AND SOME OF THE SURPRISE
IS NOT SO GOOD.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.123
LESS FAILING FROM YOU.
MORE PARENTING FROM YOU.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
SURPRISE: YOU'RE BOTH GROUNDED.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.429
Both: AW MAN!

02:43.197 --> 02:47.368
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:53.641 --> 02:55.676
I KNOW. I KNOW I
SHOULD BE HARD ON HER,

02:55.709 --> 02:58.346
- BUT IT'S JUST SO HARD.
- IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.649
IT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU...
YOU'RE NOT LIKEABLE.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.352
I'M COMPLETELY LOVABLE.
IT'S WHAT I'M KNOWN FOR...

03:04.385 --> 03:05.886
THAT AND MY LEGS.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.624
YES, THEY'RE LOVELY. WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO GO AND TALK TO LENNOX?

03:10.658 --> 03:13.727
NO NO NO, I CAN HANDLE THIS BY MYSELF.
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.596
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO SAY.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.266
ALL RIGHT, GO IN THERE AND
JUST LAY DOWN THE LAW, OKAY?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.701
RIGHT RIGHT. LAW...
LAYIN' IT DOWN.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.202
YES, AND NO MATTER
WHAT SHE SAYS,

03:22.236 --> 03:24.171
REMEMBER YOU ARE TOUGH AUNT MEL.
YOU'RE LIKE STEEL.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.440
LOVABLE STEEL?

03:26.474 --> 03:29.677
YES, STEEL WITH A
SOFT, SQUISHY CENTER.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.745
OH, I LIKE THAT.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.647
GET IN THERE, WILL YOU?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.953
SHE WILL CALL YOU BACK WHEN
SHE WINS THE NOBEL PRIZE.

03:39.987 --> 03:43.291
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LENNOX, I
HAVE BEEN TOO EASY ON YOU.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.694
THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE EASY AUNT MEL.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.363
NO, I'M NOT EASY. I'M FUN.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.931
NO, THAT'S OVER, OKAY?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.866
I WANT YOU TO STUDY
CHAPTERS EIGHT AND 10

03:52.900 --> 03:54.468
AND DO THIS FIRST PRACTICE TEST.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.370
AND THEN I CAN GO
TO JILLIAN'S PARTY.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.406
( laughs ) NO NO.

03:58.439 --> 04:02.009
NO. NO FUN, NO PHONE CALLS
AND NO ENTERTAINMENT.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.680
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SIT
HERE STUDYING CHEMISTRY?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.716
UNTIL YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.719
OXYGEN, HYDROGEN, VALIUM...
ALL THE CHEMICALS.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.989
BOY, THAT'S A LOT OF HOMEWORK.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.825
- HOW'S THAT GOING?
- GOOD.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.461
HOW'S IT GOING BEING
A SOCIAL ZERO?

04:20.494 --> 04:23.464
FUN. I HANG OUT WITH ALL THE
OTHER ZEROES ON YOUR TESTS.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.299
RYDER, LEAVE HER
ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.967
OR YOU'LL BE STUCK HERE
STUDYING CHEMISTRY TOO.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.702
I DON'T TAKE CHEMISTRY.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.771
KEEP TALKIN' BACK AND
YOU WILL, MISTER!

04:30.804 --> 04:32.840
( doorbell rings )

04:32.873 --> 04:35.776
YEAH.

04:35.809 --> 04:39.480
IF YOU'RE HERE TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT JESUS, I'M ALREADY A FAN.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.615
Man: I'M NOT A SOLICITOR,

04:41.649 --> 04:43.751
JUST A FORMER U.S. SENATOR

04:43.784 --> 04:45.753
WANTING TO SEE MY LOVELY FAMILY

04:45.786 --> 04:47.521
AND WHOEVER YOU ARE.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.659
THANKS, PETE. THAT'LL DO IT.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.027
SENATOR BURKE? IT'S A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.729
I HAVE NO DOUBT.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.666
AND YOU ARE?

04:58.699 --> 05:01.001
I'M JOE LONGO. I-I-I
TAKE CARE OF THE...

05:01.034 --> 05:03.571
I'M THE NANNY.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.706
DON'T BE ASHAMED. IT'S
A CHANGING WORLD,

05:05.739 --> 05:08.742
AND I ADMIRE A MAN WHO
TAKES ON A WOMAN'S ROLE.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.679
MRS. BURKE AND I
SOMETIMES PLAY GOLF

05:11.712 --> 05:14.348
WITH A MALE
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.584
HE'S A HOMOSEXUAL.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.588
I HAD TO TAKE THIS JOB

05:20.621 --> 05:22.790
BECAUSE I USED TO WORK FOR
YOUR SON-IN-LAW LEWIS.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.625
YEAH, AND THAT JERK TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME...

05:24.658 --> 05:27.595
MY HOUSE, MY CARS, MY SAVINGS.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.763
THAT'S A VERY NICE ROLEX.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.932
I USED TO HAVE A ROLEX.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.701
HEY, DADDY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.603
HEY, SUGAR. DIDN'T
YOU GET MY EMAIL?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.771
I'M IN TOWN FOR THE CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE LUNCHEON.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.740
THAT'S NOT TILL FRIDAY.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.542
I'M EARLY, YOU LUCKY GIRL.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.644
WHERE'S MOM? DIDN'T
SHE COME WITH YOU?

05:43.677 --> 05:47.748
NO, SHE'S HAVING ONE OF HER
LITTLE NIPPY-TUCKY WEEKENDS.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.917
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT TO TUCK?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.019
YOU'D BE AMAZED.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.588
HERE, A PRESENT FOR
MY LITTLE GIRL.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.725
I REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU USED TO LOVE
THESE WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.794
OH NO, DADDY. SEE, THAT
WAS YOUR OTHER DAUGHTER.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.663
HERE'S HOW YOU CAN
TELL US APART:

06:02.696 --> 06:06.033
I HAVE BLUE EYES AND
MEREDITH IS IN JAIL.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.669
WHERE ARE MY TWO
FAVORITE GRANDCHILDREN?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.772
- HEY, GRANDPA.
- HEY, BUDDY.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.674
HI, I'M ON LOCKDOWN.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
IF I LEAVE THE KITCHEN, MY
ANKLE BRACELET WILL GO OFF.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.745
AT LEAST LINDSAY
LOHAN GOT SUSHI.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.414
SO, PRINCESS, WHAT
ARE YOU IN FOR?

06:20.448 --> 06:22.483
WELL, SOMEONE HASN'T
BEEN STUDYING,

06:22.516 --> 06:23.951
SOMEONE'S ON THE
VERGE OF FAILING

06:23.984 --> 06:25.853
AND THESE SOMEONES ARE
THE SAME SOMEONE.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.855
TELL YOU WHAT: I
HAVE A LIMO OUTSIDE.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.758
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
HEAD BACK TO MY HOTEL

06:30.791 --> 06:33.461
AND TAKE A SWIM IN
THEIR BIG-ASS POOL?

06:33.494 --> 06:36.363
- Ryder: AWESOME.
- THAT MIGHT BE A BIG-ASS PROBLEM, SEE.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
LENNOX IS IN SERIOUS
ACADEMIC TROUBLE.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.400
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND

06:40.434 --> 06:42.402
YOU'RE NEW TO THIS
GUARDIAN THING,

06:42.436 --> 06:44.805
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT
OF MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE:

06:44.838 --> 06:48.442
PULL THE STICK OUT AND
LIGHTEN THE HELL UP,

06:48.476 --> 06:51.612
PUMPKIN.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.848
WOW, I THOUGHT SHE ONLY
MADE THAT FACE FOR ME.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.950
HEY, KIDS, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR GRANDPA UPSTAIRS

06:56.984 --> 07:00.821
AND SHOW HIM THINGS, WELL,
THAT AREN'T DOWNSTAIRS?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.791
NICE DEFLECTION, NANNY JOE.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.394
OKAY, I'LL SPEND 10 MINUTES
WITH THE CHILDREN,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.663
THEN I'LL HEAD BACK TO MY HOTEL

07:09.697 --> 07:14.502
AND I WILL NEVER TRY TO BE A
LOVING GRANDFATHER AGAIN.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.671
WELL, THANKS FOR NOT
GUILTING ME, DAD.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.107
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FORMER
SENATOR RUSSELL BURKE,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.976
REPRESENTING THE GREAT
STATE OF HIMSELF.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.650
COME ON, STEPHANIE,
IT'S A POWER OUTAGE.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.753
I'M BUSY BEING A HARD-ASS HERE.
DO THEY REALLY NEED ME?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.655
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN TURN
THE LIGHTS BACK ON.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.692
YES, STEPH, I KNOW I
HAVE A MEGAWATT SMILE.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.427
JUST GO. I CAN COVER.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.662
I'LL BE YOUR BACKUP HARD-ASS.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.697
FINE, I'LL BE THERE.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.599
JUST DON'T LET LENNOX SLACK OFF.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.467
I WON'T. LOOK, SHE'S
IN THERE RIGHT NOW

07:47.501 --> 07:49.837
WORKING ON HER
PRACTICE TEST, SEE?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.840
WAIT, HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT
JUST DOING A "COSMO" QUIZ?

07:52.873 --> 07:55.442
BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, YOU
ALREADY DID THE "COSMO" QUIZ

07:55.475 --> 07:57.945
AND YOU DID IT IN PEN, SO YOU
RUINED IT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.447
AND SECOND, EVERY 15 MINUTES
SHE LOOKS UP AND SHE SAYS,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.882
"UGH, THIS FRIGGIN'
PRACTICE TEST."

08:01.915 --> 08:04.484
OKAY, JUST DON'T LET HER GET
BACK ON HER PHONE AGAIN.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.119
THAT'D BE KIND OF HARD FOR HER TO DO.
YOU KNOW WHY?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.755
'CAUSE HER PHONE IS RIGHT HERE.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.790
OH GOOD. ALL RIGHT, NO PHONE,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.592
NO GRANDPA, NO DISTRACTIONS.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.160
JUST GIVE HER A LITTLE
WATER IF SHE ASKS.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.062
YEAH, AND IF SHE'S GOOD, I'LL
GIVE HER AN HOUR OUT IN THE YARD.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.798
- GO, ENJOY YOUR BLACKOUT.
- HEY, HOW DOES MY HAIR LOOK?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.667
WHAT AM I ASKING?
IT'S A BLACKOUT.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.807
- HEY, JOE.
- SENATOR BURKE?

08:26.840 --> 08:30.544
UM, YOU JUST MISSED
YOUR DAUGHTER.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.012
WHAT A SHAME.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.154
JOE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.523
YOU TOO. WHY ARE YOU HERE?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.058
HEY, GRANDPA.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.027
JUST WANT TO TAKE MY
BELOVED GRANDSON OUT

08:47.060 --> 08:48.729
FOR THE EVENING, IF
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.032
UM, WELL, YEAH. I
GUESS THAT'S OKAY.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.034
HEY, YOU MIND IF YOUR
SISTER COMES WITH US?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.936
- SURE, I'LL GO GET HER.
- WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.138
LENNOX HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO
AND HAS A BIG TEST ON TUESDAY.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.708
SHE'LL STUDY BETTER IF
SHE GETS A LITTLE BREAK.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.710
AND WE DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE TIME

09:02.743 --> 09:06.046
THESE KIDS ARE GONNA GET
WITH THEIR POOR OLD GRANDPA.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.183
JOSEPH, GIVE ME AN HOUR.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.652
LOOK, SENATOR, I WOULD...

09:11.685 --> 09:14.121
YOU CAN TIME US
WITH THIS ROLEX...

09:16.089 --> 09:18.091
YOUR ROLEX.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.629
NO, I COULD NEVER TAKE
ANYTHING THIS NICE

09:21.662 --> 09:23.964
AND YET SO MUCH LIKE MY OLD ONE.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.900
HERE WE GO, KIDS.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.902
SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.171
YEAH, OKAY, AN HOUR.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.674
HELLO, OLD FRIEND.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.743
OH, LOOK AT THAT FACE.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.113
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU RIDE THEM BACKWARDS.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.649
SERIOUSLY.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.720
11:00. YOU SAID YOU'D
BE BACK BY 8:00.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.222
I KNOW, BUT YOU HAD MY WATCH.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.791
AND MY PHONE.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.559
IT'S BEEN FOUR HOURS.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.561
YEAH, FOUR OF THE
GREATEST HOURS EVER.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.030
- HOLLA.
- HOLLA.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.032
LISTEN,

09:59.066 --> 10:01.568
THE ONLY REASON IT TOOK SO LONG

10:01.601 --> 10:04.071
IS 'CAUSE LENNOX NEEDED A
LITTLE TIME TO GO TO HER PARTY.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.039
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

10:06.073 --> 10:10.010
DO YOU KNOW HOW TWEETED
THAT PARTY WAS?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.912
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.246
YOU WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.883
GOD NO. THAT WOULD BE
VERY INAPPROPRIATE.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.918
I CAN'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.956
WE DROPPED HER OFF, AND GRANDPA
AND I HUNG OUT AT THE ARCADE.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.192
OH REALLY? WHY STOP THERE? WHY
DIDN'T YOU HIT A FEW STRIP CLUBS,

10:25.225 --> 10:28.228
- MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE FLIGHT INTO VEGAS?
- JOSEPH, YOU SOUND PEEVED.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.231
YES, I AM. HOLLA.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.101
KIDS, WHY DON'T YOU
SCURRY ON UP TO BED?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.069
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA. THANKS.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.905
YOU BET.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.373
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT, SENATOR.
WE SAID ONE HOUR.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.143
WELL, I TACKED ON A
LITTLE AMENDMENT.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.645
COME ON, JOE. NOBODY GOT HURT

10:45.679 --> 10:47.280
AND NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.884
WHY STIR UP A HORNET'S NEST?

10:50.918 --> 10:53.620
MAN, THAT WATCH...

10:53.653 --> 10:56.389
THAT WATCH WAS MADE FOR YOU.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.096
WELL, THE POWER'S BACK ON.
YIPPEE.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.165
I DID NOT GET TO
WEAR A HARD HAT,

11:05.198 --> 11:07.768
I STEPPED IN MUD... I HOPE...

11:07.801 --> 11:09.970
AND THE ONLY BURLY CONSTRUCTION
WORKER THAT WHISTLED AT ME

11:10.003 --> 11:12.039
WAS NAMED ALLYSON.

11:12.072 --> 11:16.276
SO WAS LENNOX IN A BAD
MOOD THE WHOLE TIME?

11:16.309 --> 11:19.212
NO, I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.748
MEL, LOOK...

11:20.781 --> 11:22.816
HEY, LOOK AT THIS PRACTICE TEST.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.752
87%? WOW.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.755
I THINK THIS WHOLE HARD-ASS
PARENT THING IS WORKING FOR ME.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.057
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT THAT
TEST IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.325
NO NO NO NO, ONLY
POSITIVE ENERGY, OKAY?

11:32.359 --> 11:35.428
JUST LET ME HAVE THIS ONE SHINING
MOMENT WHERE EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.931
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL
PRACTICE TEST.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.833
IT EVEN SMELLS GOOD.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.835
MAKES ME WANT TO ROLL
IT UP AND SMOKE IT.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.044
I HAD THE MOST WONDERFUL
DREAM LAST NIGHT.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.114
LENNOX WAS GRADUATING
FROM HARVARD AND YALE

11:54.147 --> 11:56.683
AND SHE THANKED ME FOR
THAT ONE FATEFUL NIGHT

11:56.716 --> 11:58.185
I MADE HER STAY HOME AND STUDY.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.988
LOOK, MEL, ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

12:01.021 --> 12:03.156
RUSSELL CAME BACK OVER
HERE AND IT WASN'T PRETTY.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.725
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY YOU
HAD TO DEAL WITH MY DAD,

12:05.759 --> 12:08.228
BUT THANK YOU FOR LAYING DOWN
THE LAW, DEPUTY HARD-ASS.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.000
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, LENNOX.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.902
HEY, I SAW YOUR PRACTICE TEST.

12:14.935 --> 12:19.172
NICE WORK... UNREALIZED
POTENTIAL GETTING REALIZED.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.008
WOW, YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.409
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE MAD AT ME.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.011
WHY WOULD I BE MAD AT YOU?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.046
OH, YOU DIDN'T TALK TO GRANDPA?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.014
LENNOX, LET ME TELL HER, OKAY?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.049
I'M GONNA GO LIVE
WITH GRANDPA IN D.C.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.750
Both: WHAT?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.285
WHOA, WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.421
YOU'RE GOING TO
HARVARD AND YALE.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.223
COME ON, DON'T KILL MY DREAM.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.992
GRANDPA BROUGHT IT UP WHEN
HE WAS DRIVING ME HOME.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.227
HOME FROM WHERE?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.196
JILLIAN'S PARTY.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.432
YOU WENT TO THE PARTY? YOU
LET HER LEAVE THE HOUSE

12:45.465 --> 12:47.868
AND NO ONE TOLD ME?
BACK THE TRUCK UP.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.204
WELL, GRANDPA SAID SINCE YOU'RE
HAVING TROUBLE DEALING WITH ME,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.907
WHY DON'T I COME AND LIVE
WITH HIM AND GRANDMA IN D.C.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.743
WHERE I'LL GET A YELLOW MINI
COOPER ON MY 16th BIRTHDAY?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.146
JOE, WERE YOU HOME
AT ALL LAST NIGHT

12:59.179 --> 13:01.014
WHEN THESE EXTENSIVE
PLANS GOT MADE?

13:01.048 --> 13:05.085
YOU WANTED TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
AND SMOKE A PRACTICE TEST.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.520
I THINK WE BOTH GOT FILIBUSTERED
BY YOUR DAD HERE...

13:07.554 --> 13:10.090
FILIBUSTERED HARD.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.460
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, AUNT MEL?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.096
I SAY

13:16.129 --> 13:18.331
I NEED A QUIET
MOMENT TO MEDITATE.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.507
- YOU WANT A GLASS?
- GLASSES ONLY SLOW ME DOWN.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.955
OH HEY, I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW

13:41.989 --> 13:43.523
I DROPPED THE KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL

13:43.556 --> 13:46.293
AND I WENT OVER THE ELEMENTS
WITH LENNOX THE WHOLE WAY, SO...

13:47.995 --> 13:49.863
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU
DIDN'T OPEN THAT.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.933
YEAH WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
OPEN IT TO THROW IT AT SOMEONE.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.869
( clears throat )

13:55.903 --> 13:59.039
GO AHEAD... CHICKS DIG SCARS.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.975
IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S RUSSELL.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.977
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
NANNY HE SEDUCED.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.846
OF COURSE, MOST OF
THEM GOT JEWELRY.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.884
( chuckles )

14:10.918 --> 14:13.053
YOU KNOW, I INVITED MY DAD
OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.122
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.124
I MEAN, I CAN'T WIN.
IF THINGS ARE BAD NOW,

14:17.157 --> 14:19.126
HOW BAD ARE THEY GONNA BE
WHEN I FORCE HER TO STAY?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.360
AND I HAVE TO FORCE HER TO STAY.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.430
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF SHE GOES TO LIVE WITH HIM?

14:23.463 --> 14:25.832
IT'LL BE ONE BIG
DOWNWARD SPIRAL,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.068
AND I'VE FALLEN DOWN THAT
SPIRAL MYSELF BEFORE...

14:28.101 --> 14:30.070
LITERALLY.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.305
WE HAD THIS SPIRAL STAIRCASE
AT THE GEORGETOWN HOUSE.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.942
IT WAS THE JUNIOR
PROM AFTERPARTY.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.944
AND I WAS SO WASTED,
I BROKE THREE TEETH

14:36.977 --> 14:39.212
AND FLASHED THE
ENTIRE KITCHEN STAFF.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.449
OKAY.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.085
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO WIN,

14:45.118 --> 14:47.054
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP LENNOX HERE,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.389
THEN YOU NEED TO
FIGHT HER, OKAY?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.591
AND THE WAY TO FIGHT HER
IS BY NOT FIGHTING HER.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.461
IS THAT FROM "THE KARATE KID"?

14:54.494 --> 14:57.464
MAYBE, YEAH. THE
POINT IS THOUGH,

14:57.497 --> 15:00.200
IT'S A CLASSIC TEEN GAMBIT, OKAY?
IT'S THE GAME OF CHICKEN.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.103
YOU ARE BOTH IN THE SAME CAR AND YOU'RE
HEADED TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.438
SHE THINKS YOU'RE GONNA TURN TO
HER AND SCREAM, "LENNOX, NO!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.574
STOP, PLEASE! NOT THE CLIFF!
IT'S A HORRIBLE MISTAKE!"

15:07.607 --> 15:10.043
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY THAT.
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY IS,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.445
"LENNOX, GO FASTER. LOOK
AT THAT BEAUTIFUL CLIFF.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.115
HEY, LET'S SEE IF YOUR LITTLE
YELLOW MINI COOPER CAN FLY."

15:15.148 --> 15:17.250
AND I PROMISE YOU
SHE WILL BACK OFF.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.585
YOU THINK THAT'LL WORK?

15:18.618 --> 15:21.654
YES. GUARANTEED.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.224
I MEAN, YOU'RE DESPERATE, RIGHT?

15:30.063 --> 15:34.034
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU'D BE FIGHTING
ME ON THIS LENNOX MOVE, MEL,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.269
THE WAY YOU FOUGHT ME ON EVERYTHING
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.505
I NEVER FOUGHT YOU ON ANYTHING.
AND IF I DID, YOU STARTED IT.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.173
BREAD?

15:40.207 --> 15:43.543
- THANKS, JOE.
- SURE.

15:43.576 --> 15:47.680
ANYWAY, I FIGURE YOU GUYS
HAVE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.018
AND IF THIS IS WHAT LENNOX
WANTS, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.453
WOW, I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
YOU WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.422
OH, BUT JOE, WHEN SHE LEAVES,

15:55.455 --> 15:58.325
WE'RE TURNING HER
ROOM INTO A GYM.

15:58.358 --> 16:02.029
YOU KNOW, WITH GRANDPA I DON'T
HAVE TO HAVE THE 10:00 CURFEW.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.264
HE SAYS I CAN STAY
OUT TILL 11:00.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.134
HEY, MEL, WHAT TIME WAS YOUR
CURFEW WHEN YOU WERE LENNOX'S AGE?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.936
GEE, YOU KNOW,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.504
I DON'T THINK I HAD A CURFEW.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.041
I MEAN, I STAYED OUT A LOT OF NIGHTS.
RIGHT, DADDY?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.709
I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.578
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.048
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE SO AWESOME.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.483
UM, YEAH.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.219
YOU KNOW, GRANDMA AND GRANDPA ARE
REALLY RELAXED ABOUT THAT STUFF.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.256
HEY, IS THAT FAMILY PLANNING
CLINIC STILL AT 17th AND P?

16:29.289 --> 16:31.691
I IMAGINE.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.593
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND IT.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.563
LIVING WITH RUSSELL AND MONICA IS
LIKE NOT HAVING PARENTS AT ALL.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.131
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

16:38.165 --> 16:41.534
YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.236
I'M STILL GONNA GO
TO SCHOOL, RIGHT?

16:43.270 --> 16:46.039
ABSOLUTELY, BUT NOT ONE OF THOSE

16:46.073 --> 16:49.008
ACADEMICALLY TAXING, IVY
LEAGUE FEEDER SCHOOLS.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.378
NO, YOU WANT TO GO TO A
MORE RELAXED INSTITUTION

16:51.411 --> 16:54.347
WHERE THE PRETTY GIRLS GO.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.116
- WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT?
- BREAD?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.518
- NO, DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE JUST SAID?
- BREAD?

16:58.551 --> 17:01.154
DON'T WORRY. THEY'LL HAVE
MIXERS WITH THE REAL SCHOOLS.

17:01.188 --> 17:05.158
AND THAT WAY YOU CAN MEET A PROMISING
YOUNG MAN WHO'S GOING SOMEPLACE.

17:05.192 --> 17:09.162
HOOK THE RIGHT ONE, REEL HIM
IN AND YOU'RE SET FOR LIFE.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.231
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS SHE,

17:11.264 --> 17:13.733
JUST SOME PRIZE STEER YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE TO MARKET?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.102
JOE, EASY.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.137
LOOK, RUSSELL, LENNOX
IS SMART, OKAY?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.038
AND MEL EXPECTS HER TO BE MORE
THAN JUST SOME GUY'S ARM CANDY.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.573
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S HARD ON HER.

17:20.607 --> 17:25.011
LET'S BE REALISTIC. THAT FACE
IS WASTED STUCK IN A BOOK.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.181
WHAT? YOUR FACE IS WASTED
STUCK ON YOUR NECK!

17:28.215 --> 17:30.683
- WHAT?
- JOE, GET BACK IN THE CAR.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.685
NO, I CAN'T. DID YOU
HEAR WHAT HE JUST SAID?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.288
SOMEONE'S NANNY'S GOT
HIS APRON IN A BUNCH.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.689
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.691
YOUR AUNT MEL IS GONNA
SHUT THIS DOWN RIGHT NOW

17:38.725 --> 17:40.493
BECAUSE SHE IS YOUR
LEGAL GUARDIAN.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.195
OKAY, I THINK I
HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.663
YEAH, AND SO DO I.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.399
JOSEPH, MIGHT I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU IN THE KITCHEN?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.603
SAVE YOUR FORKS.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.408
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.577
WE WERE RIGHT AT THE CLIFF. SHE
WAS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BRAKES.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.413
AND THEN YOU GRABBED THE STEERING
WHEEL AND DROVE HER STRAIGHT TO D.C.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.781
HE CAN'T SAY THOSE
THINGS ABOUT LENNOX.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.583
IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOU AND
IT'S NOT FAIR TO HER.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.485
WHO CARES? YOU
COMPLETELY LOST IT.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.155
YOU WENT ROGUE. YOU
TOTALLY BLEW THE MISSION.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.157
HE NEEDED TELLING OFF.
I'M THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

18:10.190 --> 18:12.759
AND I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS GONNA...
WOW.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.562
CAN WE GO BACK IN THERE AND TRY THIS AGAIN?
IT WAS A VERY GOOD PLAN.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.397
JOE, NO DO-OVERS, ALL RIGHT?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.799
IT'S OVER. SHE'S GONE.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.268
AUNT MEL.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.670
OH, DESSERT IN A
MINUTE, SWEETIE.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.607
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THIS WHOLE
IDEA OF ME MOVING TO WASHINGTON...

18:27.640 --> 18:30.343
OH YEAH, THAT COOL IDEA. UH-HUH?

18:30.377 --> 18:33.813
YEAH, I'M STARTING TO THINK
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT MOVE.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.516
I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING OFF
SOME KIND OF CLIFF HERE.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.321
REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.122
YEAH, I MEAN, I JUST...

18:43.156 --> 18:45.658
I DON'T WANT TO BE
SOME GUY'S ARM CANDY.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.695
AND IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF
ME MAKING SOMETHING OF MYSELF,

18:48.728 --> 18:50.830
I'D PROBABLY BE BETTER OFF HERE

18:50.863 --> 18:54.133
WITH, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE TO PUSH ME.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.204
AND IF I GO AND LIVE WITH GRANDPA IN
WASHINGTON, I COULD END UP LIKE YOU.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.807
WELL, NOT THE NOW YOU.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.775
THE MESSY-HAIRED MUG SHOT YOU.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.645
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
IT WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA

19:05.678 --> 19:07.514
FOR YOU TO GO LIVE
WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.349
YEAH, DON'T BUY BACK
THE SALE HERE, BURKE.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.151
BUT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR DECISION.
AND IT'S FINAL, RIGHT?

19:12.185 --> 19:16.223
YEAH. ANYWAY, THAT WAS IT.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.728
I DID IT.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.363
YOU DID IT?

19:23.396 --> 19:25.365
YEAH, IT WAS MY ARM-CANDY LINE

19:25.398 --> 19:27.166
THAT TURNED THE
WHOLE THING AROUND.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.235
IT WAS ME DRIVING OFF THE CLIFF.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.436
- ARM CANDY.
- CLIFF.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.870
- ARM CANDY.
- CLIFF.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.206
WE BOTH JUST GOT LUCKY
THERE, DIDN'T WE?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.308
YEAH, WE DID.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.210
I'LL TELL YOU, BURKE, WITH A
GUY LIKE THAT AS A FATHER,

19:37.244 --> 19:39.312
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE YOU'RE AS
CLOSE TO NORMAL AS YOU ARE.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.281
THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THAT
WAS CLOSE TO A COMPLIMENT.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.250
CLOSE AS YOU'RE GONNA GET.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.624
TAKE CARE, ALL OF YOU.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.594
RYDER, SORRY YOU DIDN'T
GET THAT EXTRA ROOM.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.463
DO BOYS YOUR AGE
STILL LIKE CASH?

19:56.496 --> 19:57.864
IT'S TIMELESS.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.301
THAT'S HOW MOST
LEGISLATION GETS PASSED.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.470
SO WHAT ABOUT ME, GRANDPA?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.905
OH YES, I DO HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU,

20:05.938 --> 20:08.308
BEAUTIFUL AND SMART LENNOX.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.877
"THE LIFE OF MADAM CURIE."

20:10.910 --> 20:12.912
A FAMOUS WOMAN SCIENTIST...

20:12.945 --> 20:15.214
NOT MUCH OF A LOOKER,
BUT VERY INSPIRATIONAL.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.584
THANKS, GRANDPA.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.286
OH HERE.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.654
USE THESE 20s AS A BOOKMARK.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.357
AND MEL, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING FOR YOU

20:24.391 --> 20:27.560
EXCEPT GRUDGING ADMIRATION.

20:27.594 --> 20:31.731
GRUDGING? I MEAN, THANK YOU.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.900
DEAR SWEET JOSEPH.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.535
MY WATCH.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.807
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, BUDDY.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.609
OH, HERE WE GO.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.244
WELL, SEND US PICTURES
OF MOM'S NEW FACE.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.314
I DO HOPE I RECOGNIZE HER.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.215
LET'S DO THIS AGAIN SOON.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.684
GOODBYE.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.921
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY EXCEPT

20:54.954 --> 20:58.391
LENNOX, UPSTAIRS...
HIT THE BOOKS NOW.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.960
HEY, JOE, YOU WANNA
GO SHOOT SOME HOOPS?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.962
YEAH. I'LL MEET YOU OUT THERE.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.666
LOOK, LENNOX, I'M REALLY SORRY

21:06.699 --> 21:08.501
WE'RE GONNA MISS THAT GREEN
DAY CONCERT ON MONDAY,

21:08.535 --> 21:10.970
BUT I CAN'T KEEP YOU UP TILL MIDNIGHT
THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG TEST.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.773
IT'S FINE. I UNDERSTAND.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.908
BUT IF YOU GET A "B"
OR BETTER ON THE TEST,

21:15.942 --> 21:20.313
WE WILL GO SEE GREEN DAY
IN DETROIT ON SATURDAY.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.514
REALLY?

21:21.548 --> 21:23.550
OH, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, THANK YOU.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.919
HOW'D YOU GET THOSE TICKETS?

21:26.953 --> 21:29.522
I TOLD YOU, I'M A VERY
IMPORTANT PERSON.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.624
ALL RIGHT, I'M A
SEMI-IMPORTANT PERSON.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.860
ALL RIGHT, MY DAD IS A
VERY IMPORTANT PERSON

21:33.893 --> 21:36.896
AND HE MADE A CALL FOR ME. AT LEAST
HE'S STILL GOOD FOR SOMETHING.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.932
( theme music playing )
