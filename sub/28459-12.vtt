and all of a sudden,
he was being rude to me.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.066
He was so like,
"Well, I'm good."

40:30.100 --> 40:31.233
- You want to hear something?

40:31.266 --> 40:33.133
He's actually okay
with both of them.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.500
I'm the one
who's ostracized.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.533
- How does that work out
at home?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.500
You guys are connected.

40:38.533 --> 40:41.400
Like, you can't fall out with
Tom and not fall out with Erika,

40:41.433 --> 40:43.533
'cause Erika's gonna show up
at your ----ing door.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.400
- PK adores Dorit,

40:45.433 --> 40:47.133
but it feels like

40:47.166 --> 40:50.266
with this "Lisa and Ken
versus Dorit" situation,

40:50.300 --> 40:53.000
he's kind of playing both sides
of the fence,

40:53.033 --> 40:55.266
which seems
a little strange to me.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.567
- The friendship between him
and Lisa and Ken

40:57.600 --> 41:02.433
is not more important
than my marriage to PK.

41:02.467 --> 41:05.367
- I'm not really sure
what this is,

41:05.400 --> 41:08.300
but Lisa's so trying to protect
the relationship with PK,

41:08.333 --> 41:10.433
and PK's so trying to protect
the relationship with Lisa

41:10.467 --> 41:12.433
because of these common friends.

41:12.467 --> 41:14.467
There's, like, something weird.
Like, there's something else.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.266
I don't know if it's, you know,

41:16.300 --> 41:19.166
business relationships
they're protecting with PK

41:19.200 --> 41:21.300
or that maybe they have secrets
on each other

41:21.333 --> 41:23.166
because they're all from London.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.100
Just something
I could never put my finger on.

41:26.133 --> 41:27.433

41:27.467 --> 41:30.033
All I can tell you
is it's called...

41:30.066 --> 41:32.567
a real friendship,
a deep friendship.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.567
- But a deep friendship
doesn't do that to one another.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.300
That's the point.
- A deep friendship--

41:37.333 --> 41:39.266
I'm better friends
with Lisa than PK.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.600
- I know you think you're better
friends with Lisa than PK--

41:41.633 --> 41:44.600
- I never even heard of you
or PK, sweetheart,

A year ago, these bitches
are fighting about friendship.

41:58.300 --> 42:00.100

your friend longer.

42:00.133 --> 42:04.166

in any shape or form.

to kiss ass to.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.367

that you may have heard of.

it at a birthday or a wedding

42:24.133 --> 42:25.433
or an anniversary or a--

42:25.467 --> 42:26.700
- Why would she mention PK
to you?

42:26.734 --> 42:28.367

I'm sorry, my darling,

42:33.767 --> 42:35.467
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

and I are very good friends,

42:37.533 --> 42:39.200
you'd know all my friends.

42:39.233 --> 42:41.633
