WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:09.080
GENERAL CHATTER

00:10.600 --> 00:13.080
We have a thief in our midst.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.000
What's been taken? My kippers.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Sounds very serious.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.120
I've been looking forward
to eating those perfectly smoked

00:21.120 --> 00:22.480
fish all week.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.360
I turned my back for one
moment and they vanished.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.680
Oh, no. Did they swim away?

00:27.680 --> 00:28.880
LAUGHTER

00:28.880 --> 00:31.800
Oh, Alicia, thank you for
volunteering to mop this floor

00:31.800 --> 00:34.680
instead of playing
lacrosse with the other girls.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.160
You're joking.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.760
Ellen Wilson, you are not
wearing that.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.560
Those are not even Malory Towers
colours.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.200
It's the only kit I've got.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.360
Did you borrow those huge
plimsolls off a clown?

00:51.360 --> 00:54.600
Well, I suppose it will have to do.
Now, come along, girls.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.680
Except for Alicia, of course.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.480
Mop's over there.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.080
I want to see the rest of you on
the lacrosse pitch right away.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.160
You're taking lacrosse?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.560
Yes, Miss Osborne is unavailable.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.600
Ellen, are you all right?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.800
And star jump. Jump, jump, jump.
Run on the spot.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.840
And wave about like a tree
in the wind.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.360
And lovely big high kicks.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.560
My plimsoll!

02:20.520 --> 02:22.760
Ellen, we do not have time
for you to play the fool.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.640
Hurry up, you're holding up the
class.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.880
Oh!

02:32.880 --> 02:35.360
Ellen, come back
here this instant.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.440
I will not ask again.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.040
Oh!

02:50.280 --> 02:52.440
SOBBING

02:58.680 --> 03:01.200
CAT MEOWS

03:05.240 --> 03:07.400
MEOWING

03:13.240 --> 03:16.000
CAT MEOWS

03:21.440 --> 03:27.000
Hello, little fellow. Enjoying
matron's perfectly smoked fish?

03:30.560 --> 03:32.800
Ellen is going to be in such
trouble.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.200
I hope she's all right.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.360
I wish there was something we could
do to help her.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.840
Who do you think drew that?

03:39.840 --> 03:42.760
I don't know, but I'm going
to find out.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.600
Are you coming to remedial, Irene?

03:47.600 --> 03:51.240
Yes, I need extra help with English
and science...

03:51.240 --> 03:53.040
..religious education,

03:53.040 --> 03:58.640
needlework and French. So basically
everything. Not music or maths.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.080
Alicia, you missed a bit.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.560
Ha-ha. Very funny.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.880
Why do you look so miserable?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.840
You didn't have to spend the past
half hour mopping the floor.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.920
I'm worried about Ellen.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.600
I think we should do more to help
her feel like she's one of us.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.720
Surely it's up to her to make
the effort.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.600
I mean, we may be best friends,

04:22.600 --> 04:25.320
but she doesn't even
have the right gym kit.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.600
It's not her fault.
That's all she brought with her.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.720
Well, then she should send
out for the correct one.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.040
Why don't we help her?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.280
We must have some spare things
we're not using any more.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.960
Pains me to say.
But that's a great idea, Sally.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.440
Mm-hm.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.520
Yes, I understand it's a difficult
situation.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.280
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:46.280 --> 04:49.040
Can you hold a moment, please?
Come in.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.560
No, Mr Spiers, we need to talk
about this further.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.640
You said I could have to the end
of summer, not the end of term.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.800
I know, Mr Spiers.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.240
I really have to go.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.640
But perhaps we can meet,
discuss this in person.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.920
Thank you. I will.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.960
Sorry, girls, I need to prepare
for something.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.040
We'll have to move remedial
to this afternoon.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.840
Well, of course, Miss Grayling.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.520
Oh, before you go, I have something
that could help

05:18.520 --> 05:20.800
with your word blindness, Darrell.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.080
If you keep a diary every day, it
may help organise your thoughts.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.000
It can be very beneficial
for people with your condition.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.720
Thank you, Miss Grayling.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.520
Close the door on your way out.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.840
I've never seen Miss Grayling so
worried, I wonder

05:39.840 --> 05:41.160
what that letter was about.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.400
Hmm.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.760
Maybe she's a spy and they're
her new orders.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.360
I doubt spies would be
using headed letter paper.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.760
Ron, do you know who Mr Spiers is?

05:52.760 --> 05:55.520
The only Spiers I know is a
solicitor in the village.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.160
So he deals with legal things.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.120
Of course.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.160
Why? Doesn't matter?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.400
Miss Grayling is talking to
a solicitor.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.360
Do you think that means
she's in trouble?

06:08.680 --> 06:09.960
CHILDREN LAUGHING

06:20.440 --> 06:22.280
Ellen, Matron is on the warpath.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.840
She's wondering where you've got
to. I'll go and see her.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.200
Is that a cat?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.480
I found him meeting matron's
kippers.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.680
What are you going to do with him?

06:34.680 --> 06:35.920
I don't know.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.760
Keep him safe until I can find
out who he belongs to.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.200
We're not allowed pets on the school
grounds.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.880
So I'll have to keep him hidden.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.200
I could help.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.400
Really?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.720
Thanks.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.440
I think there's a trunk in here
from last year's school play.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.680
I don't see what use an old trunk
is unless it's full of treasure.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.640
We're going to make
it beautiful, Gwen.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.440
Is this it?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.360
Must be.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.640
I don't understand.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.800
Ellen doesn't have a trunk.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.640
We're going to give her this one
and fill it with our old equipment.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.240
And if we all chip in, we can ask
someone to go to the village to buy

07:19.240 --> 07:20.720
some ribbons, to decorate it with.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.920
I'm not giving you money
to decorate a horrid old trunk.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.560
Ellen already gets a scholarship.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.560
If she wanted a nice trunk,
then she should have just brought

07:28.560 --> 07:30.200
one with her.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.280
I don't think she can afford it,
Gwen.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.680
Hah, they're hardly expensive.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.160
They are to her.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.720
If she wants to go to school here,
then she has to be willing to make

07:40.720 --> 07:42.680
sure she's kitted out properly.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.280
No, she has to work hard.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.040
That's what's important.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.480
I just think there are certain
standards everyone expects

07:48.480 --> 07:49.760
from a Malory Towers.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.240
I'm sure Ellen finds it hard enough

07:51.240 --> 07:53.600
to fit in here without you looking
down your nose at her.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.800
You know, her scholarship
isn't just a reward

07:56.800 --> 07:58.680
she gets for being clever.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.360
It pays her fees.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.000
But her family doesn't have enough
money to pay for all the other

08:03.000 --> 08:04.240
things she needs.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.960
Wha... You mean she's poor?

08:16.680 --> 08:20.400
This is just till we can find
out who you belong to.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.760
Where shall we keep him?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.480
Someone's coming.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.040
What's going on? Nothing.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.200
Iâ€”I left my chemistry prep.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.880
What's that?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.080
You got one, too.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.480
It's brilliant.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.600
What's going on?

08:51.600 --> 08:54.440
The secret artist has struck again.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.800
Is that Matron? First Mr Parker
and now this, amazing.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.320
Not bad.
Wonder who drew them?

09:01.320 --> 09:04.960
Ellen Wilson, what do you have to
say for yourself, young lady?

09:04.960 --> 09:08.160
Your behaviour this morning
was appalling.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.000
When you are at this school, you...
SNEEZING

09:11.000 --> 09:14.440
Gwendolyn, a young lady,
uses a handkerchief.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.480
Sorry, I don't understand.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.920
They only usually get like this one
is when...

09:18.920 --> 09:20.640
SHE SNEEZES

09:18.920 --> 09:20.640
When what?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.440
When I'm around cats.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.120
I'm terribly allergic to them.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.840
SNEEZING CONTINUES

09:26.840 --> 09:30.920
Hm... First, my kippers go walkabout
and now this.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.040
Are you sure none of you have
brought a pet into school?

09:37.680 --> 09:41.760
Sally, it is your duty as head
of form to tell the truth.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.440
Is there a cat in here?

09:44.520 --> 09:46.280
I don't think so.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.080
MEOWING

09:50.120 --> 09:54.120
Let me be clear, you will tell me
where it is or I will hold

09:54.120 --> 09:56.160
the whole class responsible.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.240
Jean, Ellen, please.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.520
We have to.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.240
Oh. Whose is it?

10:22.240 --> 10:23.560
It's mine.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.800
You come and see me after school,
you will discuss your punishment

10:26.800 --> 10:30.880
for this and also for leaving
games without permission.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.280
CAT MEOWS

10:32.280 --> 10:34.560
What will you do with him?

10:35.920 --> 10:38.160
I'll dispose of the filthy
creature, of course.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.360
No! Ellen, don't.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.680
Ron, get rid of this vile creature.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.880
Erm, yes, of course, Matron.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.840
Ellen!
She can't do this.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.400
She'll get you thrown out of school!
Is there a problem, ladies?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.720
No, Matron.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.480
CAT MEOWS

11:03.440 --> 11:05.360
You can't win. Not like this.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.320
No, Matron.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.800
Then get to class.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.200
I'm sorry. Don't worry.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.320
We'll make sure nothing
happens to him.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.960
Mary-Lou, can you keep a secret?

11:25.960 --> 11:30.360
Good. I'm going to find out
who our mysterious artist is. Why?

11:30.360 --> 11:31.960
Think of the fun we could have

11:31.960 --> 11:33.880
if we knew someone you
could draw like that?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.400
What are you going to do?
I give everyone in the dorm

11:36.400 --> 11:38.600
a different coloured pencil.
That's where you come in.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.720
You have to remember who I gave
each colour to.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.040
Oh, well, then what?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.760
Then I'll challenge the artist
to draw another picture.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.560
When I see what coloured pencil
they used,

11:47.560 --> 11:49.120
then we'll know who did it.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.320
Come on, let's go. I doubt... I...

11:54.840 --> 11:56.520
Darrell, wait.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.400
Oh, just the person.
I'm looking for that boy,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.480
the one who is polishing the
banisters earlier.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.840
Ron, what do you want with him?
Do you know where he went?

12:13.840 --> 12:17.080
He's probably in one of his sheds
playing with plants.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.240
He has the most tedious
existence.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.000
Anyway, Ellen, I wanted to
speak to you.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.880
Oh? Now, I understand...

12:25.880 --> 12:28.480
I understand you come from poverty.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.480
I didn't have a governess at home,
if that's what you mean.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.680
Same thing.

12:32.680 --> 12:36.600
Anyway, I wanted to let
you know that I'm still going

12:36.600 --> 12:40.120
to be your friend despite that.
That's good of you!

12:40.120 --> 12:42.360
Oh, it is, isn't it?

12:42.360 --> 12:45.520
So, friend, perhaps after lunch,

12:45.520 --> 12:47.440
we could do our French
prep together?

12:47.440 --> 12:51.240
I have too much to do without also
trying to explain it all to you.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.360
I have sweets.
It'll be my treat.

12:55.360 --> 12:59.320
Gwendolyn, I earned my place
at Malory Towers by working hard.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.200
I already helped you with
your science.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.080
If you're too lazy to do your own
prep, that's not my problem.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.600
Lazy?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.000
The whole lot of you seem to spend
more time playing pranks

13:09.000 --> 13:11.080
on each other than you do studying.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.920
Being here means something to me,
even if it's a jolly lark to you.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.680
Sally, look what Ron got for us.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.920
Could use some more gym kit.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.920
I think I might have a spare
skirt was too big for me.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.320
Sounds good.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.160
Gwendolyn, is there anything
you want to put in this trunk?

13:39.160 --> 13:42.840
No. I thought she was your best
friend.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.840
She most certainly is not.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.240
Do you need any help?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.240
We just need a few more things,
but we're getting there.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.960
It's going to look amazing.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.560
But do you know what it
really needs?

13:54.560 --> 13:58.840
Whoever drew these is clearly
very talented, so I think whoever

13:58.840 --> 14:01.520
the secret artist is should draw
another picture with Ellen

14:01.520 --> 14:03.320
and the whole lot of us.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.840
I'm going to leave these here,

14:04.840 --> 14:07.400
so the artist has everything
that they need.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.320
If no-one rushes
back after Geography,

14:09.320 --> 14:11.640
it will give them a time
to work undisturbed.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.040
Tell the others when you see them.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.080
And, Mary-Lou, hand out the pencils.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.160
CAT MEOWS

14:19.800 --> 14:21.080
Stop!

14:21.080 --> 14:22.720
Please don't get rid of him.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.560
You heard Matron. I have to.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.320
We can keep him here until we can
get him home.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.880
He belonged to the Hendersons,
but they moved away.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.120
Must have forgotten, to take
him with them. He's a stray now.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.360
That's all the more reason
we should help him. How?!

14:34.360 --> 14:35.640
What are we going to feed him?

14:35.640 --> 14:37.520
Scraps from the bins
behind the kitchen.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.120
I don't know. Please! I can get
them. You won't have to do anything.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.520
CAT MEOWS

14:44.160 --> 14:46.720
You know we could get in serious
trouble for this.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.720
Oh, thank you, Ron.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.520
Truly, thank you.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.160
KNOCK AT DOOR

15:13.760 --> 15:15.400
Mr Spires is here.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.320
Carry on with your work, girls.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.960
Yes, Miss Grayling.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.400
How do you
spell medicinal?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.400
I think it's with a C.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.040
DOOR CLOSES

15:34.760 --> 15:36.560
I'll check in the dictionary.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.240
Darrell, you mustn't. That's...

15:38.240 --> 15:40.400
If Miss Grayling were here,
she'd let me look it up.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.000
What's that?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.680
Nothing.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.280
Irene, it was a C,
you were right.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.040
Your behaviour today was totally
unacceptable.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.960
Walking off during games,
speaking back to me.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.640
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.680
You put a cat into the school.
What were you thinking?

16:39.680 --> 16:42.240
That if I didn't look out for him,
then nobody would.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.600
How have you found being here?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.320
I'm getting used to it.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.320
The other girls come from very
different backgrounds, don't they?

16:55.760 --> 16:57.280
Yes.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.000
Please, sit.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.560
They have lives where they don't
have to worry about money,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.440
where they can be,
what they want to be.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.360
I know I would have found
that strange,

17:14.360 --> 17:16.240
but you can still have a
good life here, you know.

17:16.240 --> 17:20.360
You just have to work hard and show
everyone what you're capable of.

17:20.360 --> 17:24.800
How am I supposed to do that when I
don't even play lacrosse?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.120
I've never even done Latin before.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.120
You can learn.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.760
And I hear your science
work is excellent.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.320
What if these people
never accept me?

17:37.320 --> 17:42.080
My old form teacher, Mr Freeman, is
the only one who believed in me.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.680
He thought I could do more with my
life than just looking after my aunt

17:46.680 --> 17:48.200
as she gets older.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.000
Did he help you get a place here?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.880
Yes.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.440
And he arranged a scholarship.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.360
He thought there were things
I could learn here,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.000
I wouldn't be able to back at home.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.720
How did your family feel about that?

18:02.720 --> 18:05.480
They warned me I wouldn't fit in,

18:05.480 --> 18:08.680
that the others would always
just see me as the poor girl.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.880
And now my friends from home think
I've gone all posh, coming here.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.240
I can't win.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.040
You should get back to the dorm.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.560
You're not going to punish me?

18:21.560 --> 18:25.400
No, you have enough on your plate,
but if you disobey me again,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.800
you will be in serious trouble.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.120
Understood?

18:30.120 --> 18:31.680
Yes, Matron.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.040
I wonder if the secret artist has
struck again!

18:49.040 --> 18:50.400
Let me see.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.960
They used all the colours.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.920
But it's a wonderful picture,
I thought that's what we wanted?

19:06.960 --> 19:09.280
What's going on?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.240
I gave you each a
different coloured pencil

19:11.240 --> 19:12.640
so I could tell who'd drawn it.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.320
Oh, sneaky. I approve.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.080
Someone here must have done it.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.760
Gwendolyn?

19:18.760 --> 19:22.160
Why is that funny?
I've seen your pictures, Gwen.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.760
Well, my mother says I have a very
distinctive style.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.240
Well, Mother says a lot
of strange things.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.360
There's someone missing.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.040
There's me, you, Jean, that's Irene.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.840
Sally, Gwen,
and of course, Ellen.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.360
Did the artist forget
to draw herself?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.720
Mary-Lou?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.800
Where did you learn to do that?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.120
For my grandmother,
over the summer.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.160
She taught me to really
look at people

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
and see what makes them special.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.480
I thought a picture might cheer
Ellen up.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.000
Why didn't you tell us
you drawn them?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.280
I didn't want anyone to think
I was being mean about them.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.960
But they're brilliant. Positions!

20:04.960 --> 20:06.200
Oh!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.920
What's going on?

20:17.920 --> 20:19.880
ALL: Surprise!

20:21.400 --> 20:24.080
What's that?
This is your trunk.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.480
We wanted you to have the same
things as we do.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.960
Take a look.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.240
I... I don't understand.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.720
It's our old stuff.
We thought we'd give it to you.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.080
I can't accept this.
Of course you can.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.000
Poor people are so ungrateful.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.160
I can't believe you all did that.
What were you thinking?

20:54.160 --> 20:57.120
We just wanted to cheer her up. She
already feels like a charity case.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.440
This is just rubbing it in.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.680
How would you feel if you were given
the things your friends

21:00.680 --> 21:02.240
were going to throw away?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.640
But we're not bothered
that she doesn't have as much money

21:04.640 --> 21:06.560
as the rest of us.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.440
Well, she is.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.240
Ellen!

21:29.320 --> 21:32.160
Ellen, there you are.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.680
Leave me alone.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.360
I didn't know they were
going to do that.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.920
It was humiliating.
I know. I'm sorry.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.400
What are you doing in here?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.200
CAT MEOWS

21:39.400 --> 21:41.200
Oh!

21:41.200 --> 21:44.040
Ellen, Matron told Ron to
get rid of him!

21:44.040 --> 21:46.880
I twisted his arm.
You can't keep a cat in here!

21:46.880 --> 21:49.280
Why not? I'll come in every day.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.840
Bring him food,
make sure he's happy.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.040
That's a lot of work.
He's worth it.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.960
And he doesn't have anybody else.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.000
CAT PURRS

22:01.360 --> 22:03.040
Do you want to stroke him?

22:11.360 --> 22:13.160
What's he called?

22:13.160 --> 22:14.640
I don't know.

22:14.640 --> 22:15.880
CHILDREN SHOUT

22:15.880 --> 22:18.000
But I was thinking...

22:18.000 --> 22:21.120
..I had a friend back home
called Kenny.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.920
His dad was a baker, and so
he used to bring me a sticky bun

22:24.920 --> 22:26.400
on Saturday mornings.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.040
Kenny's a good name for a cat.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.680
You know, the others' hearts
were in the right place.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.680
They meant well, even if it was
a clumsy show of affection.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.640
Maybe.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.160
CAT MEOWS

22:44.880 --> 22:48.440
Ellen, will you give them
another chance?

22:59.640 --> 23:02.440
You should draw a picture of...

23:02.440 --> 23:03.840
Can I say something?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.120
Actually...

23:05.120 --> 23:08.720
..can I say we're really sorry?
We didn't mean to upset you.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.200
I'm so sorry.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.440
I'm so sorry, Ellen.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.040
It was so kind for you to give me
all those things.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.520
Thank you.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.720
This is really good.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.160
Mary-Lou drew it.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.200
Miss Grayling would be
ever so impressed.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.240
Sally.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.560
We need to talk.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.800
What about?

23:35.800 --> 23:39.000
Erm, earlier today, when
I was in Miss Grayling's study,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.480
I accidentally read a letter
she received this morning.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.760
Accidentally?

23:43.760 --> 23:46.960
Yes. Erm, what does "arrears" mean?

23:46.960 --> 23:49.640
It's when you're behind in
paying for something.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.760
Why?

23:50.760 --> 23:53.120
I was afraid it was something
like that. Erm...

23:53.120 --> 23:55.680
I think Miss Grayling
owes the bank a lot of money.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.280
Are you sure?

23:57.280 --> 24:00.160
Well, I couldn't understand most
of the words, but the letter seemed

24:00.160 --> 24:03.080
to be saying that if she doesn't
repay it then the bank

24:03.080 --> 24:04.320
will take over the school.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.080
What does that mean?

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
Malory Towers will have to close.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.400
SHUTTER BANGS
