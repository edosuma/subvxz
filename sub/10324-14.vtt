06:37.163 --> 06:39.927
Kid? He's a grown man.
Shouldn't he be out on his own?

06:40.032 --> 06:42.933
We told him to look for an apartment.
We gave him a month's rent.

06:43.035 --> 06:46.334

to an Ultimate Fighting match.

Who, me? The guy with no job, who has no skills?
Go wait in the motel room you pay for?

11:15.774 --> 11:18.208
This isn't about you.
It's about this loser.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.438
If you think he's a loser,
then you must think I'm a loser too.

11:21.546 --> 11:24.242
- He does. He does think you're a loser.

Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course.

Well, at least now I know the truth.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.087
Wh-Where you going?

11:35.193 --> 11:38.754
I'm going to prove to you

11:38.864 --> 11:40.422
Cool!

11:40.532 --> 11:43.399
- I'm gonna follow you around now

- Hmm.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.364
Looks like I got myself a Randy.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.683
Aren't you worried about Randy?

11:59.785 --> 12:02.652
Randy? My brother? Nah.

12:02.754 --> 12:04.779
He'll be back

- or forgets he's running away.

You picked the wrong one, dummy!

12:16.001 --> 12:20.028
No. Other dummy. You picked the stupid turtle,

12:20.138 --> 12:23.904
- Where's the one I gave you?
- He's in the pool with all the other animals

I'm conflicted. I would love

But I don't want him to worry about
his poor little buddy out there on his own.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.989
- I think he'll be okay.
- I don't know. Anything can happen.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.185
It's a dangerous world out there
for a helpless guy like that.

12:47.866 --> 12:50.300
I mean, he's slow, he's vulnerable.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.667
He sure is. He doesn't even look
before he crosses the street.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.935
If you touch him and you don't wash
your hands, you could get salmonella.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.600
And he eats anything people give him.
