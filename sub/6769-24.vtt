{\an1}You think?

09:31.904 --> 09:33.614
Uh...

09:34.907 --> 09:36.951
Noah asked me
to move in with him.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.495
And a couple of weeks ago,

09:39.578 --> 09:40.997
I would have done it,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.666
but now, because of you,
I'm not sure.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.626
Maybe that's why he asked.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.004
{\an1}Felt like you were
slipping away.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.094

09:56.554 --> 09:59.348

to be an airplane pilot,

09:59.432 --> 10:02.810
a... fireman, a veterinarian.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.897
{\an1}But never... you know,
never a... a model.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.110
{\an3}Well, thanks for
making the stretch.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.072
{\an1}But I'm going
to miss this job.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.707
Don't move in with him.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.710
I hardly even know you,
but even I can tell that, uh...

10:27.793 --> 10:29.962
{\an1}you're not doing it
for the right reasons.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.775
{\an1}Noah, I'm glad you called.
Been a long time.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.568
{\an3}I don't think so,
and neither will you

10:52.651 --> 10:53.861
after you read this.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.863

you've already read it.

seeping into the ground,

10:57.448 --> 10:58.449
{\an3}people actually
getting sick.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.452
{\an1}Yeah, I've read it--
recently.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.870
Recently?
It's two years old.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.372
You were my father's
right-hand man.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.791
The lawyers found it
in your father's personal safe.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.959
You're saying
he buried evidence?

11:11.545 --> 11:14.298
{\an1}The joint development
with Olson Oil

11:14.382 --> 11:16.550
{\an1}kept the company afloat
the last year.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.552
{\an3}Come on, he wouldn't
do this for cash.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.971
{\an1}He defined himself
by the company's success.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.890
When it finally went belly-up...

11:22.973 --> 11:24.225
He killed himself.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.729
{\an1}The report says that there was
just a chance of leakage.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.439
Or a chance
it would cause cancer.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.941
You're telling me
he took that chance?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.110
He wouldn't want you
to think of him that way.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.945

{\an3}I'm just checking
messages, man.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.181
The station's supposed
to be calling

12:04.265 --> 12:06.183
about some artist booking
or something.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.436
From the booth behind you.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.486
You get the one in the middle.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.654
Uh, no.

12:18.737 --> 12:19.655
Message from Steve--

12:19.738 --> 12:20.656
said it's not important.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.658
Something from Noah--

12:22.741 --> 12:24.660
I, I wasn't really
paying attention.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.995
{\an3}DAVID: See, there's, like,
five hang-ups on here.

12:26.078 --> 12:26.996
Man, it's got to be Gina.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.164
Hmm, what?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.957
Gina.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.834
No, David, I haven't.

12:31.917 --> 12:32.835
See, breakups are
kind of like a train wreck.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.962
You don't want to linger
too long at the scene.

12:35.045 --> 12:35.963
Yeah, whatever.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.047
Come on, we both know how long

12:37.131 --> 12:39.508
you hung out around Kelly
after you guys broke up.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.843
{\an1}Well, it was different,
you know.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.136
I've known her all my life.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.637
Gina and I--

12:43.721 --> 12:46.515
we've never been, uh...
platonic.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.517
If you don't
want to talk

12:48.601 --> 12:50.227
about Kelly, fine,
we won't talk about Kelly, okay?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.480
I thought we were talking
about Gina.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.397
We were talking about Gina

12:53.481 --> 12:54.356
and then we started talking
about Kelly

12:54.440 --> 12:55.441
and you got all, like,
you know, paranoid

12:55.524 --> 12:58.194
and the eyebrows were going
and it was ridiculous.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.697
{\an1}Great girls, both of them,
but both hands are played out.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.741
Besides, I think
it would be, uh...

13:04.950 --> 13:05.826
It'd be rude

13:05.910 --> 13:07.203
not to thank these ladies.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.412
I think you should
cut your losses.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.956
No, press my winnings.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.585
You know, from over there,

13:14.668 --> 13:16.420
this looks like
a much better place to be.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.796
Mind if I sit?

13:19.924 --> 13:21.383
MIKE:
Thanks for coming tonight.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.718
JANET:
No problem.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.720
{\an3}So I was just losing
the nerd mantle

13:24.803 --> 13:26.889
{\an3}when I won the
Math Maven Award.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.681
Science Genius, seventh grade.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.391
Presented
at the school assembly.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.643
Universal humiliation.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.728
You know, I ran

13:32.811 --> 13:34.230
into one of my teachers
while I was in Anchorage.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.523
AYeah.?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.608
I spent an entire summer
in Alaska.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.692
Okay, this is too weird.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.693
We went to the same college...

13:39.777 --> 13:41.904
Yeah, we love the same
off-the-market cereal.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.030
I've got to talk

13:43.113 --> 13:45.574
to someone about buying stock
in the Love Fisher.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.784
{\an3}Yeah, um...

13:46.867 --> 13:48.285
that would be Steve.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.747
My..Me, too.end.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.874
A... a girlfriend, I mean.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.084
Three years.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.712
Her name's... Janice.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.298
(groans)

14:01.382 --> 14:03.217
What are we doing here?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.885
Admitting
there might be such a thing

14:04.969 --> 14:06.720
as a perfect person.

14:06.804 --> 14:12.601
Yeah, and maybe
we're not going out with them.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.652
{\an5}MEL:
I'm sorry
I couldn't see you sooner.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.861
Oh, that's okay.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.739
{\an3}I was really grateful that you
had evening hours available.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.532
The filling is set.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.158
Just stick
to soft foods tonight.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.327
Okay, thank you so much.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.955
You know, there's
a process called bonding

14:33.038 --> 14:34.665
that'll restore
the enamel you've lost

14:34.748 --> 14:35.833
on the inside of your teeth.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.835
Okay, well,
I'll check into that.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.504
I just have to get
some insurance.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.715
You've waited
a long time already.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.802
How long have you been bulimic?

14:46.885 --> 14:48.470
What?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.806
You obviously have
an eating disorder.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.809
The stomach acid strips
the enamel.

14:53.892 --> 14:54.810
You've been making
yourself sick,

14:54.893 --> 14:56.729
and you've been doing it
for a very long time.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.314
Um, do you know what?
I have my checkbook here,

14:58.397 --> 15:00.149
so do you want me
to just pay you now?

15:00.232 --> 15:01.317
Or I can have...

15:01.400 --> 15:02.651
I'll give you the name
of an internist.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.153
{\an1}You could have
esophageal damage,

15:04.236 --> 15:05.988
severe vitamin loss.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.698
Look, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.492
I'm fine.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.828
You look fine,

15:12.911 --> 15:15.122
but you could drop dead tomorrow
from heart failure.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.169
Well, with the week
that I've been having...

15:20.252 --> 15:21.712
(chuckles)

15:21.795 --> 15:22.838
...that would be a relief.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.479
Dylan, open up, man.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.688
I won, like, $80.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.565
I put $1.50
in the machine downstairs.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.900
It was crazy.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.485
Come on.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.695
Hi.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.238
Hi.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.907
Come on in.

16:03.170 --> 16:07.132
{\an3}Hey, um, you remember Mary
from last night, David?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.300
Oh, sure.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.426
So I'm gonna go talk

16:09.510 --> 16:10.594
to Mm-hmm....

16:10.678 --> 16:11.887
...see if I can
get Mm-hmm.k...

16:11.970 --> 16:12.888
{\an1}...and then
I'm gonna come back.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.264
How's an hour?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.100
That's, uh, that's great.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.768
Good.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.895
Oh, I hope
you guys brought sunscreen.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.731
{\an3}(chuckles)

16:22.815 --> 16:24.733
That's, that's Mary.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.903
She... she knows
a, uh, unmarked trail

16:27.986 --> 16:29.571
that, uh, leads all the way
to Hoover Dam.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.073
{\an1}I don't know
how you do it, man.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.409
They just, like, flock to you.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.410
Well, you know, David,

16:34.493 --> 16:36.704
it's, uh, it's a gift actually.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.414
It's kind of
a curse, too.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.416
Well, I sure wish
you'd pass the torch.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.292
I will at breakfast--
oh, which reminds me,

16:42.376 --> 16:44.420
{\an3}I told Mary that I might
be coming back to town

16:44.503 --> 16:47.256
{\an3}in a couple of weeks
on business, so, you know...

16:47.339 --> 16:48.257
Get out of here.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.299
You lied to her?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.300
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.301
{\an3}Back me up on that,
will you?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.430
{\an3}Come on.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.776
It's a little crooked.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.613
Oh, look,
I found this in a drawer.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.614
I didn't even know

17:12.698 --> 17:14.282
I still had it.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.784
Toastie Bun Buns?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.453
I haven't seen those in...

17:17.536 --> 17:19.246
Seven years, yeah.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.457
{\an3}I ran into
a friend of mine,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.083
who got me in touch
with the distributor,

17:23.166 --> 17:24.710
and I bought a case.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.962
No.you want some?

17:27.045 --> 17:28.213
I'm a Pop Tart guy.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.300
{\an1}Look, I tried
to call you last night.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.760
Yeah, I was out late

17:32.843 --> 17:33.969
getting that framed.

17:34.052 --> 17:35.137
{\an1}Hmm.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.305
Maybe we can practice

17:36.388 --> 17:37.681
a little long division later,

17:37.765 --> 17:39.057
but in the meantime, you're late

17:39.141 --> 17:40.809
I was out with a guy named Mike.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.060
{\an3}Okay?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.479
He's a Science Genius

17:43.562 --> 17:44.772
and he likes Toastie Bun Buns.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.024
The Love Fisher--
you couldn't resist.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.484
It was strictly anthropological.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.943
I can't believe you did that.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.362
Believe me,
I'm, I'm sorry I did.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.864
Well, that hurts.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.450
You have fun?

17:56.533 --> 17:59.161
It was by the numbers perfect.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.455
Of course it was;
you're the Math Maven.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.457
And it was--

18:03.540 --> 18:06.376
{\an3}it was by the
numbers boring, too,

18:06.460 --> 18:09.630
because I don't want
to date another me.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.299
Steve, it was...

18:12.382 --> 18:13.175
an experiment,

18:13.258 --> 18:16.470
{\an1}and I learned
that I have already found

18:16.553 --> 18:19.389
my perfect mate-- you.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.311
You're late for
color spotting.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.271
{\an3}Your breath smells
like Toastie Bun Buns.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.564
Right.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.525
Sorry.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.083
DYLAN:
This is Dylan.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.084
Leav(beeps)sage.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.420
(clicks)

18:50.504 --> 18:51.839
(speed-dial tone)

18:51.922 --> 18:52.840
(line rings)

18:52.923 --> 18:53.841
This is Dylan.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.342
Leav(beeps)sage.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.426
(clicks)

18:57.636 --> 18:59.096
Hey.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.722
Where is Matt?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.349
{\an3}Oh, he is meeting
with, um,

19:02.432 --> 19:03.433
{\an3}doctors and medical
researchers.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.560
He'll be in in a while.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.311
I can't eat.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.396
A new filling, you know.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.523
Actually, that was for Matt.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.066
Oh.
(chuckles)

19:11.149 --> 19:15.070
Listen, Gina... I'm sorry.

19:15.153 --> 19:19.241
Oh, is this the little talk that
you've been wanting to have?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.910
{\an1}Kelly, you slept
with my boyfriend.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.412
{\an1}I think
that about covers it.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.247
If I could take it back,
I would.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.082
{\an1}Oh, so now you're
going to apologize?

19:27.165 --> 19:28.083
Wow, that's great.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.295
Now I really see
how truly wonderful you are.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.548
{\an3}If being around me
is making it harder on you,

19:34.631 --> 19:37.426
then maybe we should rethink
the roommate situation.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.468
{\an1}I'm having
enough trouble

19:38.552 --> 19:40.929
trying to get through the day
without screaming,

19:41.013 --> 19:41.972
so the last thing I need

19:42.055 --> 19:44.266
is to go out and look
for another place to live.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.601
I apologized

19:45.684 --> 19:46.602
and I meant it,

19:46.685 --> 19:47.728
and you can accept that

19:47.811 --> 19:49.062
or you can leave.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.148
It's up to you.

20:19.509 --> 20:23.305
{\an3}Why don't you and I go
take a look at the house,

20:23.388 --> 20:27.309
kind of size it up
from the outside?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.478
{\an1}(sighs)

20:29.561 --> 20:30.938
Moving in-- it's just,

20:31.021 --> 20:35.442
it's a big deal, you know?

20:35.525 --> 20:37.611
Don't be mad, okay, but I just--

20:37.694 --> 20:40.489
I feel like you're pushing this
for the wrong reasons.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.115
Look, I want to be with you.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.284
{\an3}If you don't feel the same
way, wh-why are we together?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.120
Does it have to be
all or nothing?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.289
I mean, at some point, yeah.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.459
{\an3}Look, the realtor said there's
other applications, okay?

20:52.542 --> 20:55.545
If we don't call him back
by 7:00, it's gone.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.799
Look, I know what I want here.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.010
You figure out what you want,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.554
you call the realtor, okay?

21:10.769 --> 21:14.022
(door opens, bell rings)

21:14.106 --> 21:16.191
(door closes)

21:20.112 --> 21:21.905
(door opens)

21:21.989 --> 21:24.700
Hey, are you ready to go?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.034
Yeah, I checked
us out already.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.035
Get out of here.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.286
Let me give you
some cash, man.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.871
No, no, man, it's on
me, it's all right.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.415
{\an1}Yeah.ure?

21:31.498 --> 21:32.874
{\an1}Hey, you know that hike
that we went on,

21:32.958 --> 21:33.959
that Mary told us about?

21:34.042 --> 21:36.086
{\an1}That was a lot of fun;
I wish she could have made it.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.255
{\an3}Well, to tell you the truth,
I kind of like the quiet.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.215
{\an1}What, did she talk
too much?

21:40.298 --> 21:41.842
{\an3}Oh, God, are you kidding
me? "Wh-Where are you from?

21:41.925 --> 21:44.052
{\an3}Do you have any
brothers or sisters?"

21:44.136 --> 21:46.930
{\an1}She probably just wanted
to know who she slept with.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.307
(knocking)

21:51.518 --> 21:53.729
Uh... hi.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.272
I got your message.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.732
I wanted to say good-bye.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.526
I didn't mean
to pull you away from work.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.069
I'm on my lunch hour.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.237
(clearing throat)

22:02.320 --> 22:03.739
I'm gonna go check out.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.407
I already did that, David.

22:05.490 --> 22:09.161
We just got to get going now
to the, uh, to the thing.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.204
I got this thing--

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
it's this, uh, this, uh...

22:12.205 --> 22:14.082
It's like a... a meeting
up at the station.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.083
Is it important?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.918
Yeah, it's my boss.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.087
I thought you owned the club.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.130
{\an1}DYLAN:
You have a great memory.

22:20.213 --> 22:23.258
Actually, um, David works
for the radio station.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.302
Oh.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.553
{\an3}So, um...

22:26.636 --> 22:29.723
Well, that's it pretty much.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.938
So, you, you'll call, right,

22:37.022 --> 22:39.608
{\an3}when you know
you're coming back?

22:39.691 --> 22:43.487
Okay.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.614
{\an1}Um... bye.

22:49.659 --> 22:53.413
So, good luck...
with your meeting.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.790
Thanks.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.801
I read the environmental report.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.095
Look, it doesn't have
to come out in court.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.638
No, no, let it.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.806
{\an1}You're not fighting
the charges?

23:10.889 --> 23:11.973
Before my father died,

23:12.057 --> 23:13.433
he apologized for
everything he did.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.310
He didn't mention this.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.771
You don't know what
went on in his head.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.981
The pressure
I don't care.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.609
Look, I found this stuff
when I cleared out his office.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.320
You know, I have enough
to push a settlement.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.613
I'm sure there's more.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.031
Noah...

23:28.115 --> 23:29.449
Matt, I want to do this, man.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.493
{\an3}Come on.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.786
All right.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.838
STEVE:
Damn.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.548
(compuUgh.beeps)

23:44.631 --> 23:45.841
{\an3}DONNA:
Steve, hey.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.008
Hi.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.636
{\an3}Where would your
real estate listings be?

23:49.719 --> 23:51.054
Tomorrow's ad copy
is on Janet's desk.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.347
Trying to get a jump?

23:52.430 --> 23:53.974
Um, I lost the realtor's card,

23:54.057 --> 23:56.309
and I can't seem to remember
the name of her firm.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.811
Really, you guys
are really serious

23:57.894 --> 23:59.396
about moving in together.

23:59.479 --> 24:03.400
Do you think
it was easier for you

24:03.483 --> 24:05.819
to be committed to Janet since
you have dated so many women?

24:05.902 --> 24:07.028
I don't know.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.322
I don't think
it'll ever be easy.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.699
I've only been
with two guys.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.034
Noah and David, two.

24:13.118 --> 24:17.414
You're always dreaming
of finding "the one."

24:17.497 --> 24:21.418
{\an1}Yeah... and then when
you find the one,

24:21.501 --> 24:24.421
{\an1}you realize it might
be the last one.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.465
DONNA:
Noah's just so ready.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.341
I feel like if I don't catch up,

24:28.425 --> 24:30.051
I might as well
be going in reverse.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.053
I want to do this.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.390
I'm... I'm gonna call
the realtor.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.893
I'm gonna call Janet.

24:45.984 --> 24:50.572
Um... I think I'm just gonna...

24:50.655 --> 24:52.532
I'm just gonna
call from the car.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.326
Okay, I'll see you later.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.376
God!

25:05.503 --> 25:08.381
(dialing)

25:10.175 --> 25:12.928
(with deep voice):
Hello, Lilly?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.596
This is Steve Sanders.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.098
I got your number
from the Love Fisher.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.433
(phone ringing)

25:18.516 --> 25:19.267
Wayne?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.435
Hi, it's Donna.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.436
Hey.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.438
I wasn't gonna call, but...

25:23.521 --> 25:29.402
um, I just, I kind of need
to talk to you in person.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.487
And I want to see you.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.586
Is something wrong?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.297
No.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.094
{\an3}What?

25:54.177 --> 25:56.513
Nothing.

25:58.556 --> 26:01.101
What is it,(sighs)

26:01.184 --> 26:02.477
You totally led her on.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.271
No, boy meets girl, it happens.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.315
Dylan, you told her
you would see her again soon.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.316
And I might.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.818
You never know.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.486
{\an1}I don't know
how you manage

26:11.569 --> 26:15.365
to not care
about hurting anybody,

26:15.448 --> 26:17.993
you know, it's, it's beyond me.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.327
{\an3}One night at a
time, David.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.371
It was just a one-night stand.

26:21.454 --> 26:23.206
What if you never
see Mary again?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.208
That'd be fine with me.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.751
{\an1}You had such a
great thing

26:26.835 --> 26:28.378
with Gina, you know?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.921
And you just totally blow it off

26:30.005 --> 26:31.756
{\an1}and I mean,
that was something

26:31.840 --> 26:33.883
that any guy would kill for.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.844
Present company excluded?

26:37.762 --> 26:39.097
I think you blew

26:39.180 --> 26:41.016
a good thing for nothing,
all right? that's it.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.143
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.728
{\an3}I thought I was living
with a roommate,

26:44.811 --> 26:47.355
not a hall moniYep.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.819
(phone ringing)

26:52.902 --> 26:54.321
(sighs)

26:56.281 --> 26:57.866
Yeah?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.701
Dylan, it's Mary.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.411
Uh, uh, no, Mary,
this is, this is David.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.038
Dylan isn't home.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.707
Well, I have a friend I've
been meaning to visit in L.A.,

27:05.790 --> 27:07.375
and I thought
maybe I'd drop by.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.710
Really, you're coming to L.A.?

27:08.793 --> 27:10.211
You want to stop by here?

27:10.295 --> 27:11.838
Unless you think I shouldn't.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.382
No, you know what,
I think you should.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.925
Absolutely.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.970
Dylan was just saying how
he can't wait to see you.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.555
Could you give me your address?

27:20.638 --> 27:22.349
Yeah. You got a pen?

27:22.432 --> 27:25.101
Yeah, hold on. I'll get one.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.354
{\an5}MATT:
What do you say
we call it quits, huh?

27:30.648 --> 27:32.901
Would you stop already?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.903
There's nothing else here.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.073
Oh, God, of mementos.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.407
Take it home.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.159
Put it under your bed.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.372
What you got there?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.415
My Little League
certificate, man.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.292
We got them every year,
you know?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.753
I used to think
it was pretty cool.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.713
Apparently, so did your dad.

27:53.797 --> 27:54.464
(chuckles)

27:55.423 --> 27:57.759
Hey. I stopped by the house.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.761
Steve said you guys
pulled an all-nighter.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.721
Uh, well, Noah did.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.306
{\an3}I slept for a
good 20 minutes.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.100
Did you find anything?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.851
Yeah, I think we did.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.562
So, what'd you tell the realtor?

28:09.646 --> 28:13.149
That's, uh, what I came by
to talk to you about.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.027
Okay, um, yes or no?

28:17.862 --> 28:18.780
No.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.573
I guess we have nothing
to talk about, then.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.951
Maybe this just
isn't a good time.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.577
It's a perfect time to move in.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.580
To commit, the two of us,
you know?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.416
At least I thought it was.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.417
You're not letting me
explain here.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.626
No, I guess I'm not.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.968
Oh, let me guess,

28:40.051 --> 28:42.262
{\an3}your Pee Wee
football certificate.

28:42.345 --> 28:44.097
Not quite, Matt, not quite.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.682
What is it?

28:52.355 --> 28:53.440

This is Janet;
we work together.

Hi there.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.203
Um, can I get
a Black Russian, please?

29:48.286 --> 29:50.163
Sure.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.125
So, Lilly, how do you
like the Love Fisher?

29:54.792 --> 29:57.212
So far so good.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.421
You?

30:04.302 --> 30:05.970
Janet, Janet!

30:07.305 --> 30:09.599
You're a liar.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.726
I was curious!

(door opening)

30:20.360 --> 30:21.945
Hi.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.906
Hi.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.534
{\an3}Is something wrong
with that food?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.285
No.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.411
I made that pasta.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.080
Sorry.going to eat it.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.582
Maybe, you know, we could
start labeling our things.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.085
Mine and yours.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.338
That was probably the
confusion you had about Dylan.

30:42.799 --> 30:46.636
Listen, Gina,
I talked to my stepdad.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.263
So?

30:48.346 --> 30:50.223
So, he wanted me
to give you the card

30:50.306 --> 30:51.432
of that doctor...

30:51.516 --> 30:52.809
{\an1}I'm not having
this conversation.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.727
Gina, Mel is worried about you.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.062
Well, I don't need a doctor.

30:56.145 --> 30:59.440
I know about eating disorders
firsthand.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.401
I don't have an eating disorder.

31:01.484 --> 31:05.405
{\an3}Look, when I was skating,
a lot of the girls

31:05.488 --> 31:06.990
had problems with that,

31:07.073 --> 31:10.326
and some of them did...
stuff to lose weight,

31:10.410 --> 31:11.911
but I never did.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.913
Bulimia isn't about
controlling your weight.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.832
It's about
controlling your life.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.458
I don't really understand
what that means.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.961
It just sounds like a bunch
of psychobabble to me.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.423
{\an1}Maybe, uh...
controlling your pain.

31:23.506 --> 31:27.427
You mean, like pain that I feel
because I found out

31:27.510 --> 31:29.762
that my boyfriend slept
with another girl in Mexico?

31:29.846 --> 31:31.598
I am not going
to apologize for that again.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.807
{\an3}Oh, good.

31:32.890 --> 31:33.766
I guess we're done here.

31:33.850 --> 31:34.934
Looks that way.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.986

31:45.945 --> 31:47.739
{\an1}Adam, I'm glad
you could make it.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.657
Uh, sorry I couldn't
make it any earlier.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.200
{\an1}My attorneys have
to justify their bills

31:51.284 --> 31:53.036
{\an1}by keeping me
at meetings all evening.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.704
Well, it takes
a lot of time

31:54.787 --> 31:56.539
{\an3}figuring out how to
bury an innocent man.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.833
What are you talking about?

31:58.916 --> 32:00.877
"The office of Daniel Hunter."

32:00.960 --> 32:02.879
{\an3}To, uh-- what do you
know-- Adam Krieger, huh?

32:02.962 --> 32:05.340
{\an3}"The Environmental
Impact Report.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.425
{\an3}Kill the PacGlen
project immediately."

32:07.508 --> 32:08.343
Let me see that.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.886
{\an3}"We can't risk the
environmental damage.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.597
{\an3}"Please inform Olson
and other partners that

32:12.680 --> 32:13.848
"we are pulling out.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.016
Signed, Daniel Hunter."

32:15.099 --> 32:16.434
Your friend,
the one you sold out.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.190
I can explain.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.025
My father wanted to
stop this project.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.526
{\an3}You and your partners
went ahead anyway.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.904
{\an3}Then you got sued when
it got all messed up

32:27.987 --> 32:30.031
{\an3}like he knew it would,
and you blamed him.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.324
Explain that.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.202
I'll explain it for you.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.371
{\an3}You didn't think a
dead man could speak

32:36.454 --> 32:37.538
for himself, did you?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.499
Guess what? He can.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.387
I'm glad you had
a change of heart.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.222
What did I do
to deserve it?

32:54.305 --> 32:55.390
{\an1}Nothing.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.392
Stop. You're
flattering me.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.851
(laughs)

32:58.935 --> 33:00.311
No. Nothing's good.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.856
{\an1}It's easy and simple,
uncomplicated.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.775
At our age, who'd want it
any other way?

33:05.858 --> 33:06.818
Hmm.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.236
You'd be surprised.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.696
{\an3}Well, the way
I see it,

33:09.779 --> 33:11.197
we're way too young to know
what we really want.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.198
We should look around.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.116
See what's out there.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.034
Only way to know
who we should end up with.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.912
Who our perfect mate might be.

33:17.995 --> 33:18.955
And if yours is Noah...

33:19.038 --> 33:20.581
Mm, this isn't about him.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.208
Then no matter what we do,

33:22.291 --> 33:23.793
you guys will be together.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.211
That just sounds so simple,

33:25.294 --> 33:26.587
Mm-hmm.ou think?

33:26.671 --> 33:30.383
I mean, if fate's so strong,

33:30.466 --> 33:33.219
then our actions
have no consequence.

33:33.302 --> 33:34.220
I don't think they do.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.389
And the people who do...

33:36.472 --> 33:37.557
they're the ones who stay

33:37.640 --> 33:38.766
in these bad relationships
too long,

33:38.850 --> 33:41.102
because they're afraid of
the consequence of ending them.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.813
So, if I'm meant
to be with someone...

33:43.896 --> 33:44.814
Mm-hmm.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.315
...then nothing that we do

33:46.399 --> 33:47.275
will change that.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.318
So, why not just sit back,

33:49.402 --> 33:52.113
relax and enjoy the ride?

33:57.243 --> 33:59.287
If you insist.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.965
(knocking on door)

34:14.260 --> 34:15.303
{\an1}I was...

34:15.386 --> 34:18.389
just driving...

34:18.473 --> 34:20.349
past your house,

34:20.433 --> 34:22.226
You don't have to explain.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.936
{\an3}It's okay.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.817
(clearing throat)

34:29.900 --> 34:32.320
Uh... hi.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.987
{\an1}DYLAN:
Hi, Mary.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.616
Hi, Mary.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.159
No,houldn't have come.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.161
{\an3}uh, don't leave.
I-I'm just...

34:40.244 --> 34:42.121
He's, uh, he's just...

34:42.205 --> 34:44.123
the scum of the earth.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.333
Wait. Hey, uh-- surprised.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.793
Shut up, Dylan!

34:47.877 --> 34:49.879
{\an3}We haven't even been
broken up a week.

34:51.922 --> 34:52.965
Where're you going?

35:04.310 --> 35:05.520
{\an4}DYLAN:
What I'm saying
is that unlike you,

35:05.603 --> 35:07.188
{\an1}I didn't hurt
anyone intentionally.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.190
What are you talking abYou.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.859
You-you roll out the red carpet
for, uh, Mary.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.237
{\an3}Oh, did I forget to mention
she was stopping by?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.197
I'm sorry, Dylan.
Gee, imagine that.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.698
{\an3}Somebody in this house
being thoughtless.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.700
Mm-hmm, yeah, well,
you maybe thoughtless,

35:19.784 --> 35:21.202
but yLook, she called

35:21.285 --> 35:22.537
and said she wanted to stop...

35:22.620 --> 35:23.871
She wanted the address,
all right?

35:23.955 --> 35:24.831
I'm on the phone with the girl,

35:24.914 --> 35:26.666
she's asking where's Dylan?
I don't know.

35:26.749 --> 35:27.875
You-you just went outside.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.877
Do you want Gina, David?

35:29.961 --> 35:33.047
Is that what this is about?

35:33.130 --> 35:34.382
{\an1}You know what, Dylan?
If...

35:34.465 --> 35:36.509
{\an1}if you want to blame
this whole mess on me,

35:36.592 --> 35:38.511
then fine, all right,
it's my fault.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.388
Is that better?
That make it all better?

35:40.471 --> 35:41.556
I'll tell you what I'll do,

35:41.639 --> 35:43.224
{\an3}I'll make it
very easy for you.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.101
David, you want Gina,
you take her.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.894
Huh?!

35:46.978 --> 35:48.855
Take her! Hear me?!

35:49.939 --> 35:52.275
Yeah, he heard you.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.659
{\an3}(chuckles)

36:05.705 --> 36:07.123
Chocolate shake?

36:07.206 --> 36:09.250
Damn, this thing.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.252
Here.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.254
{\an1}(sighs)
Look, Janet, I...

36:13.337 --> 36:16.257
{\an1}I acted like an ass
last night.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.758
{\an1}I was kind of hoping
you'd forgive me.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.094
I knew you'd try
"The Love Fisher."

36:20.177 --> 36:23.264
And it got me mad because...

36:23.347 --> 36:24.098
you're as weak as me.

36:24.181 --> 36:26.225
{\an1}We fell victim to the hype
that's all.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.561
Yeah, the perfect match.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.272
That-that would require
perfect humans.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.982
Name mRight.

36:33.065 --> 36:35.610
We dump the Love Fisher disc.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.486
Like a bad date.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.201
Oh, imagine that.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.744
Being able to find
your perfect match

36:44.827 --> 36:46.746
just by hitting control X
on your keyboard.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.331
{\an1}Yeah.ol X?

36:48.414 --> 36:51.083
That's how you tell the computer
to find your perfect mate.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.001
No, that's control Y.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.461
Control X finds your opposite.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.588
Control Y?

36:56.589 --> 36:58.591
This means...

36:58.674 --> 37:00.426
She may still.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.094
be out there.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.096
Steve, drop the disc,

37:04.180 --> 37:06.098
{\an3}or I walk out
the door forever.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.100
Who? You or my true love?

37:08.184 --> 37:10.019
You have to choose.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.521
Well, that's just it.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.649
I don't have to choose.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.611
Come here, you.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.159
MATT:
So, we're agreed?

37:25.242 --> 37:26.327
Good.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.537
I'll draw up the settlement
agreement in the morning.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.206
All right.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.375
So, what'd they say?

37:32.458 --> 37:34.585
Well, thanks to the smoking gun
you uncovered,

37:34.669 --> 37:36.879
{\an1}Olson Oil has graciously
agreed to settle the case.

37:36.963 --> 37:37.880
And my dad?

37:37.964 --> 37:39.340
Your dad's good name,

37:39.423 --> 37:41.008
and his opposition
to the project

37:41.092 --> 37:43.177
{\an1}will be clear for everyone
to see, it's all right.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.679
(sighs)
Thank you.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.681
I(knock on door)

37:51.310 --> 37:53.270
Hey. (smooches)

37:53.354 --> 37:55.189
Any word?

37:55.272 --> 37:58.234
{\an1}Yes, unconditional
surrender.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.361
Oh, how do you feel
about that?

38:00.444 --> 38:02.029
I feel pretty good about it.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.656
Good.

38:03.739 --> 38:04.740
Thank you.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.786
{\an3}Well, I'm glad the
case worked oMm.

38:09.745 --> 38:10.621
Me, too.

38:10.705 --> 38:14.041
Things seem to be doing that
for us lately.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.376
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.044
Yeah.ng out.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.212
Feels good, doesn't it?

38:18.295 --> 38:19.213
{\an3}No secrets.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.215
No complications.

38:21.298 --> 38:24.051
For the first time, everything
just seems to be good.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.511
{\an1}I like it.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.597
I like it a lot.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.645
(knocking on door)

38:42.319 --> 38:45.197
Just... go away, Dylan.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.200
I... I didn't mean that
like it sounded--

38:48.284 --> 38:50.202
what I said to David.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.246
I was just, you know,
I was angry.

38:52.329 --> 38:53.039
Oh, you were angry.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.459
So, that just makes you
want to...

38:56.542 --> 38:59.211
pass your girlfriend around
like an old sock.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.047
Okay.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.006
I deserved that.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.925
{\an3}We both know you're
better off without me.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.053
Tell me something
I don't already know.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.055
How about that I care about you?

39:09.138 --> 39:11.057
I don't like

39:11.140 --> 39:14.060
hurting you, and if I knew
what it was that I wanted,

39:14.143 --> 39:16.062
it would probably be you.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.563
But since you don't,

39:17.646 --> 39:20.941
you're just gonna
go ahead and...

39:21.025 --> 39:22.985
sleep with a bunch
of different girls?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.073
Bye, Dylan.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.619
(door slamming)

39:59.313 --> 40:02.274
(vomiting)

40:04.610 --> 40:07.696
{\an4}WAYNE:
So, which would you prefer,
a fish place in Malibu

40:07.780 --> 40:09.156
{\an1}or a burger joint
in Manhattan?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.866
DONNA:
I am confused.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.159
That's cool; I mean no rush.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.410
{\an3}About us.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.788
Oh, about...

40:15.871 --> 40:18.582
{\an1}Donna, didn't we already have
this, uh, conversation?

40:18.666 --> 40:21.544
Yeah, we sure did, but...

40:21.627 --> 40:27.550
you know, it's just,
I haven't told Noah yet, and...

40:27.633 --> 40:29.802
I thought I should
tell him about us.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.011
I... well, I mean,

40:31.095 --> 40:33.013
not that there is an "us,"

40:33.097 --> 40:35.015
but I just think

40:35.099 --> 40:37.726
I should tell him about it-- us.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.020
Do you getYeah.idea here?

40:40.104 --> 40:42.481
Anyone ever tell you that
you stress way too much?

40:42.565 --> 40:44.024
(sighing): No, never, hmm.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.359
{\an1}I mean, you look
cute doing it,

40:45.442 --> 40:47.361
but you stress
way too much.

40:47.444 --> 40:49.029
(sighs)

40:49.113 --> 40:51.532
{\an3}I'm just trying to
be honest, that's all.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.451
And I honestly want to kiss you.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.871
Well, honesty's good.

41:07.798 --> 41:08.757
(phone rings)

41:08.841 --> 41:10.384
Hello.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.678
DYLAN:
Hey. It's me.

41:12.761 --> 41:13.804
Are you with Matt?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.389
Uh, no.

41:15.472 --> 41:17.516
He had some work to do,
wrapping up the lawsuit.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.059
I'm in the car.
What do you want?

41:19.143 --> 41:22.021
Look, I, uh, I need
to talk a friend.

41:22.104 --> 41:24.023
I qualify.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.232
In person.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.692
Dylan. It's late.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.236
Do this for me, all right?

41:29.320 --> 41:30.738
Fine.

41:30.821 --> 41:33.574
I'll meet you... at my place.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.242
Uh, been there, done that.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.744
That's a bad idea.

41:36.827 --> 41:37.745
<i>Oh,</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:39.246
so this is about Gina?

41:39.330 --> 41:43.250
This is about me wanting
to get high right now.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.419
I don't, I don't think
that's a good idea.

41:45.502 --> 41:46.629
Dylan.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.047
Okay, stop.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.256
Where are you?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.257
I'll come to you.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.718
I am at...

41:52.801 --> 41:54.720
Frank's Coffee shop
on Hollywood Boulevard.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.930
You know it?
