<i>Beeline, this is Apache Renegade,
nearing extraction point 3.0.</i>

01:16.161 --> 01:17.562
<i>How copy?</i>

01:17.662 --> 01:21.154
<i>Apache Renegade, this is Beeline.
All copy.</i>

01:21.599 --> 01:23.969
APACHE:
<i>Beeline, Team Dogbite is on the ground.</i>

01:24.069 --> 01:27.672
<i>Repeat, Team Dogbite is on the ground,
outside Matubahk.</i>

01:27.772 --> 01:32.467
- <i>Returning to outpost Renegade.</i>
- BEELINE: <i>Copy that, Apache. Good luck.</i>

02:25.363 --> 02:27.187
<i>Now?</i>

02:28.433 --> 02:30.257
Nope.

02:30.902 --> 02:33.695
- Not now.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

02:54.492 --> 02:56.417
I'll be damned.

03:00.498 --> 03:02.056
You see that?

(SILENCER)

03:20.018 --> 03:21.919

Not now.

(SILENCER)

03:43.809 --> 03:46.177
Now. All clear.

03:46.277 --> 03:48.135
<i>Moving.</i>

04:25.583 --> 04:28.276
This was Johnny Longbow's.

05:03.788 --> 05:05.991
A rabbit's foot?

05:06.791 --> 05:10.816
- Can't hurt.
- No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

05:16.167 --> 05:19.520
We're at Zulu, up high. You got a visual?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.957
Roger. Moving to Bravo.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.947
Vasquez, move.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.658
(CRUNCH)

06:08.353 --> 06:12.473
Overwatch, confirm clear.
We're ready to check Bravo.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.986
We're good here.

06:17.262 --> 06:19.253
(HINGE SQUEAKS)

06:22.933 --> 06:26.293
Bravo is clear bottom. Heading topside.

06:41.919 --> 06:44.722
Overwatch, Two is at Charlie.

06:44.822 --> 06:47.315
Anything in my area?

06:48.726 --> 06:51.252
That's a negative. Quiet as a mouse.

06:58.035 --> 07:00.326
Hey, Vic.

07:01.139 --> 07:02.540
Yeah, Jake.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.377
I've been thinking about
that 50 bucks I owe you.

07:05.477 --> 07:08.519
Hey, don't even. And it's 60 bucks.

07:09.579 --> 07:14.286
How about if we knock off five dollars
for every time I save your ass today?

07:15.886 --> 07:19.090
Tell you what. How 'bout we double-down

07:19.190 --> 07:22.027
if I get your butt
out of here in one piece?

07:22.127 --> 07:24.495
No deal.

07:24.595 --> 07:29.167
Where does an entire personal
security detail disappear to?

07:29.267 --> 07:32.436
That's the same thing I was thinking, man.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.171
I really don't know.

07:34.271 --> 07:38.109
Your guess is as good as mine.
Just keep your eyes open, head on a swivel.

07:38.209 --> 07:41.368
Copy all. Two holding at Charlie.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.819
Bravo is clear above and below.

07:48.919 --> 07:53.614
We got a butt-load of mix-caliber brass,
some blood trails, nothing else.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.788
- You ready?
- Yeah.

08:22.888 --> 08:24.578
(HINGE CREAKS)

08:38.369 --> 08:41.461
They're done. No package.

08:48.646 --> 08:51.749
Beeline, Beeline, this is Dogbite.
How copy? Over.

08:51.849 --> 08:54.452
<i>Dogbite, Beeline. Solid copy. Send it.</i>

08:54.552 --> 08:58.456
Beeline, Beeline, Dogbite is at Delta.

08:58.556 --> 09:01.326
I say again, Dogbite is at Delta.

09:01.426 --> 09:04.159
We have the personal
security detail all down hard.

09:04.529 --> 09:08.099
No joy on the package.
I say again, no joy on the package.

09:08.199 --> 09:11.001
Last chance is Echo.

09:11.101 --> 09:13.838
Oscar Mike there now. How copy?

09:13.938 --> 09:17.296
<i>Dogbite, copy all. Standing by.</i>

Hey.

Vasquez.

09:44.902 --> 09:47.427
Doc, eyes.

09:59.049 --> 10:01.686
Hey, you think they're waiting
for us inside?

10:01.786 --> 10:05.222
No. They're gonna hit us on the way out.

10:05.322 --> 10:07.247
Doc.

10:17.168 --> 10:19.025
Clear!

10:23.841 --> 10:24.991
Clear!

10:26.111 --> 10:28.079
Clear.

10:28.179 --> 10:30.281
- Positive ID?
- Yep, that's the congressman.

10:30.381 --> 10:32.606
Help me cut him down.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.342
Cut him.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.448
Bring him down. I got him. Yep, he's mine.

10:42.293 --> 10:45.096
Congressman? Congressman!

10:45.196 --> 10:47.020
Sir!

10:48.265 --> 10:50.267
All right, they got him
narc'd with something.

10:50.367 --> 10:54.071
I'm gonna hit him with Narcan to bring him
out of it, then we gotta get out of here ASAP.

10:54.171 --> 10:57.508
Beeline, Beeline, be advised,
we have the package.

10:57.608 --> 10:59.777
I say again, we have the package.

10:59.877 --> 11:01.396

11:01.496 --> 11:03.881
Sir, sir, sir, stay calm.
Look at me, look at me.

11:03.981 --> 11:07.772
Hey, look at me, okay?
We're here to help you, okay?

11:07.872 --> 11:10.722
Beat up, but still breathing.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.091
We will be moving to Foxtrot 3 for exfil.

11:14.191 --> 11:18.128
Seven pax. And we need a doc on the bird.
How copy? Over.

11:18.228 --> 11:22.317
<i>Dogbite, Beeline. Copy all.
No birds available at this time.</i>

11:22.417 --> 11:27.371
<i>Exfil will be ground. Meet the vics
at Foxtrot 3. They are rolling now.</i>

11:27.471 --> 11:30.174
Beeline, that is a piss-poor option.
I say again, piss-poor option.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.378
We have a priority package.
Can we get a bird?

11:33.478 --> 11:36.347
<i>Negative, Dogbite.
No air authorized on this one.</i>

11:36.447 --> 11:40.351
<i>ETA on the vics is five mikes,
call sign "Rattler."</i>

11:40.451 --> 11:44.389
Copy, Beeline. We'll talk about this later.
Break, break. Overwatch, Overwatch.

11:44.489 --> 11:48.893
Be advised we are Oscar Mike
to Foxtrot 3 for ground exfil.

11:48.993 --> 11:51.028
I say again, ground exfil.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.365
Cover our move and join the party
once you have eyes on the incoming vic.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.534
<i>How copy? Over.</i>

11:56.634 --> 11:58.936
Oh, hang on. There's dust being kicked up

11:59.036 --> 12:01.906
by something on the back street
to your right as you come out.

12:02.006 --> 12:06.399
Roger that. We'll come out with
the package when ride is confirmed.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.161
Confirmed. Humvee inbound.

12:10.781 --> 12:14.786
All right, gents. You heard him? Good?
Marcus, give Doc a hand.

12:14.886 --> 12:16.777
Okay.

12:24.028 --> 12:27.198
All right, help us out. Get on your legs.
Use those legs. There you go, buddy.

12:27.298 --> 12:30.668
All right, you are glue to him. All right.

12:30.768 --> 12:35.941
Overwatch, Overwatch, we are Oscar Mike
with package to Foxtrot 3 for exfil.

12:36.341 --> 12:39.677
- Cover our six.
- Roger. On our way.

- Moving. Let's go.
- Go.

Maintain my six.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.016
Copy.

13:26.587 --> 13:28.993
Oh, man, that felt like a trap
from the get-go.

13:29.093 --> 13:30.984
Like we had a choice.

13:44.692 --> 13:47.362
At least they're not behind us.

13:47.662 --> 13:49.986
Not yet, anyway.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.977
This is as far as we can go.

14:09.717 --> 14:12.252
Rattler, Rattler!

14:12.752 --> 14:14.822
We're in a firefight at position Charlie.

14:14.922 --> 14:19.383
Not sure we can make it to Foxtrot 3.
If you make it, you come to us.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.993
Doc, Miller, Marcus, move it! Let's go!

14:42.883 --> 14:44.184

- Cover!

Shit!

Rattler! Rattler! This is Dogbite!

We're still in a heavy firefight!

15:07.542 --> 15:12.380
Position Charlie! Playtime is over!
I say again, playtime is definitely over!

15:12.480 --> 15:16.504
When you enter the ville,
bypass Foxtrot 3.

15:16.604 --> 15:20.220
Head directly to the city square.
I say again, city square.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.746
We're on the southwest corner.

15:25.159 --> 15:28.362
And, gents, give us
as much firepower as you got

15:28.462 --> 15:31.421
so we can get this package on the vic.

15:32.249 --> 15:34.184

and don't let go.

Get him in there!

16:32.509 --> 16:34.800
Get him in!

16:35.729 --> 16:37.998
Vic, we can't hold
this position any longer.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.857
Don't you move! Don't you dare move!

16:53.481 --> 16:57.674
- Vic, we gotta go.
- Jake, where are you guys? We gotta move!

17:03.824 --> 17:06.082
Come on, boy, let's go.

17:14.416 --> 17:17.857
Vic, the orders are clear!
You're risking everything by now!

17:18.271 --> 17:19.963
Shit!

17:25.244 --> 17:27.470
Get out of here!

17:28.248 --> 17:30.140
Go!

17:33.621 --> 17:35.645
Come on.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.269
- Do you know your name?
- Cooper.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.372
Cooper? Congressman Cooper,
I'm Sergeant Richter of the U.S. Army.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.297
We're taking you back to base, all right?

17:57.377 --> 18:00.014
Let me have that thing.
Keep it up. Come here.

18:00.114 --> 18:03.751
You're gonna be okay. All right.

18:03.851 --> 18:06.336
Where are you?
Open another field dressing.

18:06.436 --> 18:09.461
Give me one more pack. Hurry up.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.689
- We should go back.
- We can't.

18:16.789 --> 18:19.467
Getting the congressman to safety
is our number one priority.

18:19.567 --> 18:22.236
I know what our number one priority is.

18:22.336 --> 18:26.169
- Okay.
- I'm just saying I'd like to go back.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.760
And we will, Vic, as soon as we can.

18:29.860 --> 18:33.260
Hang in there, buddy. Hang in there.
I gotta keep pressure, okay?

18:33.360 --> 18:36.914
- You all right? Step on it, Charlie!
- I'm crushing it, Vic.

18:55.122 --> 18:57.811
I'd like to be more helpful,
Miss Conrad, but your timing's off.

18:57.911 --> 19:00.674
- Maybe in a couple of days.
- I can't believe this.

19:00.774 --> 19:03.978
You're deliberately
hamstringing me, Colonel. Why?

19:04.378 --> 19:09.217
Nobody is hamstringing anybody. It's simply
not safe outside the wire right now.

19:09.317 --> 19:13.554
That's ridiculous. This is a war zone.
It's never going to be safe.

19:13.654 --> 19:17.457
Look, you may have finagled
your way onto this combat outpost,

19:17.557 --> 19:20.227
and you may be Admiral Willet's niece,

19:20.327 --> 19:23.630
but none of that buys you
a ride outside this wire.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.239
It's just too damn dangerous.

19:25.339 --> 19:28.869
I'll have you know I was embedded
with Cheyenne at Obamadad.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.571
Yeah, and three soldiers
were killed on that ride-along.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.676
Ah, so you're saying I'm some kind of jinx?
You're saying I got those men killed?

19:35.776 --> 19:38.245
I'm not saying anything of the kind.
Here's what I am saying.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.381
You are not going outside my wire.
End of discussion.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.342
I see. So you are hamstringing me.

19:51.225 --> 19:54.917
- Incoming!
- Oh, shit. What's that?

19:56.997 --> 19:59.133
Move it! Move it! Let's go!

19:59.233 --> 20:02.592
- Medics on the way!
- Get him out, get him out!

20:04.338 --> 20:06.028
Okay.

20:08.075 --> 20:10.810
Hey, get the congressman down
to the colonel now, ASAP.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.404
Trevor, close that gate, damn it!
Secure it!

20:16.717 --> 20:21.018
- Medic's here, buddy.
- No, Charlie, I can walk. Don't need no medic.

20:21.118 --> 20:25.579
- We can get you inside, get you patched up.
- No, I can walk. Let me walk. Vic!

20:26.030 --> 20:28.795
I'm sorry, buddy. It has to be this way.
Get him on the stretcher now!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.125
- You! Get over here!
- Hey!

20:31.365 --> 20:35.258
- Come on. One, two, three.
- (GRUNTS)

20:38.738 --> 20:41.258
- Charlie, you got him?
- I got him. Grab him.

20:41.358 --> 20:44.651
One, two, three, go! Let's go, move.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.620
I don't know who you are or what you want,
but stay away from my men.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.323
- And who authorized you to take photos?
- Easy, cowboy.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.692
Stay away from my men.
Do you understand me?

20:58.792 --> 21:02.384
NATO correspondent,
so just cool down, okay?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.856
Hey, you can't do that.

21:09.169 --> 21:13.748
- Give that back to me. Give that...
- Charlie, keep her out.

21:13.848 --> 21:15.109
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, my God.

21:15.209 --> 21:17.800
No, no, no.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.681
Excuse me, Sergeant,
is that Congressman Cooper?

21:20.781 --> 21:22.249
Ma'am, please, just stand back.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.519
- Is that Congressman Stan Cooper?
- Ma'am, please step aside.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.589
What is he doing in there? Is he wounded?

21:28.689 --> 21:30.713
Damn it!

21:53.763 --> 21:56.984
It was just a bright flash
of light right in my eyes.

21:57.084 --> 21:59.811
It must have ricocheted off the Humvee.
(GROANS)

21:59.911 --> 22:04.077
- My face feels like it's on fire!
- I know, Marcus. Let Shipley take a look.

22:06.193 --> 22:07.928
(GROANS)

22:08.628 --> 22:10.496
Well?

22:10.596 --> 22:13.465
I can see shapes.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.003
- It's all blurry.
- Marcus, listen to me, buddy.

22:16.103 --> 22:18.635
Stop talking and let Shipley
take care of your wounds.

22:18.735 --> 22:23.071
Just sit back and relax, okay?
We'll be back to check on you. Let's go.

22:23.171 --> 22:25.192
- Hey, Vic.
- Yeah.

22:25.292 --> 22:28.315
Thanks for dragging me into that Humvee.

22:28.415 --> 22:32.356
- If I had just been a little bit faster.
- Yeah, forget it.

22:32.456 --> 22:36.263
It's what we do, right?
We watch each other's six.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.295
May I have a word with you?

22:41.395 --> 22:46.067
V? You know what we gotta do.
Go get the gear prepped. Stand by.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.636
Roger that.

22:49.336 --> 22:52.106
- What do you want?
- I know we got off on the wrong foot.

22:52.206 --> 22:56.276
I'd really like to fix that.
You know I got a job to do. So do you.

22:56.376 --> 23:00.247
Sometimes I can be a little pushy 'cause I'm
one of those people no one wants around.

23:00.347 --> 23:04.385
If I don't push, I don't get.
Makes me pretty unpopular.

23:04.485 --> 23:08.055
- So I'm sorry.
- Fair enough.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.780
Janet Conrad.

23:12.559 --> 23:16.297
- That Janet Conrad?
- What's that supposed to mean?

23:16.397 --> 23:19.900
- I think maybe I heard of you.
- Don't start with this jinx nonsense.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.802
Imbedded in Portacurdey.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.703
- Obamadad.
- Have a nice day.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.072
Was that Congressman Cooper
you just brought in?

23:26.172 --> 23:28.975
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Congressman Stanford Cooper.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.978
He's one of the most vocal opponents
of military spending.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.814
He'd shut this whole
operation down if he could.

23:34.914 --> 23:39.620
Cut your paycheck, cancel your vacation,
shoot your dog, yet here he is.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.872
Why?

23:42.322 --> 23:45.058
Sure sounds like you know
a lot more than I do.

23:45.158 --> 23:48.795
What's he doing here?
Why are you being so evasive?

23:48.895 --> 23:51.487
I have a debrief to attend.

24:01.892 --> 24:04.260
We didn't make it out, huh?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.218
No.

24:09.332 --> 24:14.626
- What about the others?
- Some did, some are lying out there.

24:16.573 --> 24:19.644
Thanks for not leaving me behind.

24:20.394 --> 24:23.002
Don't mention it, brother.

24:26.383 --> 24:27.884
Jake?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.709
Yeah.

24:31.622 --> 24:34.197
I can't move my legs.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.849
I'm trying, but...

24:38.195 --> 24:40.524
I can't feel anything.

24:41.764 --> 24:46.269
You got a round lodged in your spine.
I stopped the bleeding, but...

24:46.369 --> 24:48.488
there's really not much more
I could do for now.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.715
We gonna have to wait
until some folks get here.

24:53.543 --> 24:55.979
When will that be?

24:56.279 --> 25:00.505
Soon, I hope, man. Our 119 is shot.

25:01.184 --> 25:03.819
Can't fix this damn thing.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.046
Probably we're gonna have
to just wait it out.

25:11.528 --> 25:15.364
- And you checked the bodies?
- Yes, sir. All of 'em.

25:15.464 --> 25:18.167
Full of bullet holes. Some of 'em cut up.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.287
Bodies were all stripped clean
of body armor and weapons.

25:21.387 --> 25:26.210
They had the bodies stacked up in that
little shop across the street from the hotel.

25:26.310 --> 25:30.722
Looks to me like it was a real intense,
close-quarter battle. They lost.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.465
Then we headed over to the hotel.
They had the congressman

25:33.569 --> 25:37.520
strung up there like a damn worm
on a hook, and we took the bait.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.423
- Then what?
- Request to speak freely.

25:40.523 --> 25:42.492
Shoot.

25:42.592 --> 25:47.797
How in the hell does a non-military
observer like the congressman...

25:48.797 --> 25:53.202
get authorization to go on some
sightseeing tour in Matubahk

25:53.302 --> 25:56.606
and then fall into a damn ambush
that is so perfectly laid out

25:56.706 --> 26:00.424
that not one of the team members
of the personal security detail survives

26:00.524 --> 26:03.029
or radios for help?
Don't smell right, sir.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.148
I don't have a good answer
for you, Sergeant Mosby.

26:05.248 --> 26:07.884
What about the congressman?
Why was he spared?

26:07.984 --> 26:10.791
Who the hell knows?
Maybe they were planning to stage

26:10.891 --> 26:14.090
some Internet extravaganza with him
or trade him for something they want.

26:14.190 --> 26:16.891
They only had him for a day.
Maybe they didn't have any plan at all.

26:16.991 --> 26:18.795
Maybe.

26:19.595 --> 26:22.819
All right, sir, look,
as far Chandler and Cannon go...

26:22.919 --> 26:26.736
If you're talking about
going back into Matubahk today...

26:26.836 --> 26:30.206
- Negative.
- Why? Those are my men, sir.

26:30.306 --> 26:34.110
Because I'm short of people
and ammunition.

26:34.410 --> 26:35.912
Here's the deal, Mosby.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.816
Renegade got hit hard last night,
and they're still under pressure.

26:39.916 --> 26:42.752
All available air assets
have been committed to that fight.

26:42.852 --> 26:46.857
In the meantime, I get word a major
Taliban force is headed in our direction.

26:46.957 --> 26:49.392
If that's the case,
I don't have the people,

26:49.492 --> 26:52.228
and I don't have the ammo
to stage an effective defense.

26:52.328 --> 26:55.398
So I am not authorizing
anything outside the wire

26:55.498 --> 26:58.668
until we get resupplied and reinforced.

26:58.968 --> 27:01.559
Now go see about your men.

27:06.542 --> 27:09.292
- All right, when do we go?
- We don't.

27:09.392 --> 27:11.214
What?

27:11.314 --> 27:13.717
Colonel says we wait.

27:13.817 --> 27:18.321
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know. He's got his reasons.

27:18.421 --> 27:21.925
- I'm just not sure I'm buying.
- What are you gonna do?

27:23.025 --> 27:25.328
I'm gonna go ask some questions.

27:25.428 --> 27:28.321
You stand by. Be ready to move.

27:38.074 --> 27:41.044
Marcus. You awake, buddy?

27:41.144 --> 27:44.280
Hey, Vic. Yeah, I'm awake, all right.

27:44.380 --> 27:48.351
They just gave me a shot
of the good stuff, so it won't be long.

27:48.451 --> 27:51.688
That's good, buddy. That's good.
You need your rest.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.624
Well, I'm sorry about Doc and the guys.

27:55.724 --> 27:57.477
Yeah, yeah, we all are.

27:57.577 --> 28:02.054
I guess compared to them,
I'm the lucky one.

28:05.234 --> 28:09.872
I want you to have this.
Maybe it'll do you some good.

28:09.972 --> 28:13.498
Besides, I heard
there's a jinx in the camp.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.746
News travels fast, huh?

28:17.446 --> 28:21.001
- You, uh, sure you can spare this?
- (CHUCKLES)

28:21.101 --> 28:25.389
Yeah, I'm sure. As long as
you have it, I know you'll be okay.

28:25.489 --> 28:30.082
All right, buddy. I'll take
real good care of it, all right?

28:31.427 --> 28:32.711
(GROANING)

28:41.571 --> 28:43.634
(MOANS)

28:47.243 --> 28:48.544
- Congressman?
- (SCREAMS)

28:48.644 --> 28:51.881
It's okay, it's okay.
You're safe, you're safe.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.183
I'm Sergeant First Class Mosby.

28:54.283 --> 28:56.719
I was leading the rescue team
this morning, sir.

28:56.819 --> 29:00.122
It's okay, it's okay. Relax, relax.

29:00.622 --> 29:03.292
Congressman. Sir.

29:03.392 --> 29:05.862
I need to know what happened in Matubahk.

29:06.362 --> 29:08.376
Sir...

29:08.476 --> 29:11.337
was it an ambush
or was it something else, sir?

29:11.437 --> 29:12.969
Congressman?

29:13.169 --> 29:17.774
You're not gonna get anything out of him.
He's been on the hard stuff for a while.

29:17.874 --> 29:20.802
- Ah, damn it.
- Yeah.

29:20.902 --> 29:24.180
I heard him talking before he passed out.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.910
He was rambling.

29:27.250 --> 29:29.753
What'd you hear him say?

29:30.253 --> 29:35.224
He said a name... two, three times.

29:35.324 --> 29:36.760
I don't...

29:36.860 --> 29:40.931
Ab... Abdul Abbat...

29:41.531 --> 29:44.021
Abdul Azim Abad?

30:04.588 --> 30:06.289
Sergeant.

30:07.489 --> 30:09.714
How's your friend?

30:14.197 --> 30:16.066
Ma'am?

30:16.666 --> 30:19.827
You keep doggin' me. Why?

30:19.927 --> 30:22.705
Hey, I thought we were friends now.

30:22.805 --> 30:25.842
Besides, you're the most
interesting soldier I've met so far.

30:25.942 --> 30:28.278
Well, you must not be looking too hard.

30:28.578 --> 30:32.649
Let's call a truce. I'm sure we can find
a happy balance, don't you think?

30:32.749 --> 30:35.785
- You haven't even gotten to know me yet.
- (CHUCKLES)

30:35.885 --> 30:38.522
Oh, I think I know you pretty well.

30:38.622 --> 30:40.692
Let's see.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.727
Spoiled little rich girl.

30:43.827 --> 30:47.217
Probably went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton.

30:47.317 --> 30:51.351
- Mount Saint Agnes.
- Oh, Mount Saint Agnes. Close.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.703
Uh, you got some heavy hitters
in your background.

30:53.803 --> 30:57.374
The kind of folks that can push along
your little career in NATO

30:57.474 --> 31:01.077
to get you exactly
where you want to be fast.

31:01.177 --> 31:05.682
I'm guessing you're probably
somebody's daughter, granddaughter...

31:05.782 --> 31:07.950
- Niece.
- Niece!

31:08.050 --> 31:10.453
- Admiral Willett's.
- Oh, even better.

31:10.553 --> 31:13.322
That's outstanding. Admiral.

31:13.422 --> 31:16.826
Well, the admiral must not be
too fond of you if he sent you here.

31:16.926 --> 31:20.529
You kidding me?
I begged for this assignment.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.799
But your colonel keeps smothering me.

31:22.899 --> 31:27.537
It wouldn't do for the lieutenant colonel to
allow you to get your ass shot on his watch.

31:27.637 --> 31:30.873
- Can you blame him?
- No, but I didn't fly all the way out here

31:30.973 --> 31:35.061
just to photograph some soldiers washing
their skivvies and playing horseshoes.

31:35.161 --> 31:38.883
- Hmm.
- I have to ride along on a mission.

31:40.383 --> 31:42.552
I see. I feel your pain.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.822
But that is not my call.

31:45.922 --> 31:49.426
Now, ma'am, if you will excuse me,

31:49.526 --> 31:52.584
I've got some skivvies to wash.

31:55.431 --> 31:56.835
(DISTANT DOG BARKING)

32:20.389 --> 32:22.291
It's funny.

32:22.391 --> 32:25.428
My girl back home is always ragging on me.

32:26.528 --> 32:30.256
Stress of all this makes her
kind of crazy, you know?

32:33.603 --> 32:38.704
So yesterday...
I get this letter from her.

32:39.809 --> 32:43.502
Not a phone call,
just an old-fashioned letter.

32:45.448 --> 32:48.540
Says she found someone new.

32:49.819 --> 32:52.229
Someone who...

32:52.329 --> 32:54.813
could be there for her.

32:56.692 --> 32:59.365
Someone who wasn't halfway
around the world.

33:01.630 --> 33:05.625
Didn't think this day could get any worse,
and then this happens. (LAUGHS)

33:09.389 --> 33:11.511
I mean, what are the chances, right?

33:13.141 --> 33:16.546
Listen, you're gonna get a Silver Star
out of this when it's all over,

33:16.746 --> 33:19.949
and you'll have all
the girlfriends you want.

33:20.049 --> 33:22.273
Yeah, right.

33:26.322 --> 33:29.125
Sergeant, Jackson wants to see you.

33:29.225 --> 33:32.629
- He send you to look for me?
- That's the memo.

33:32.729 --> 33:36.321
Damn. Stand by.

33:39.986 --> 33:42.144
Never waste a good cigar.

33:48.745 --> 33:50.413
Colonel.

33:50.513 --> 33:54.083
Gents, we got an update
on what happened to our resupply.

33:54.183 --> 33:56.553
This is Bashir. He's a terp from Renegade.

33:56.653 --> 34:01.090
Seems Bashir and a specialist by the name
of Tyler were on one of the supply trucks.

34:01.190 --> 34:04.828
Escort hits an IED ambush
followed by a ground attack.

34:04.928 --> 34:07.964
Bashir and Tyler take off
cross-country in the truck.

34:08.063 --> 34:11.760
They reach a point about eight clicks
from here. Truck breaks down.

34:11.860 --> 34:15.371
Bashir dismounted, walked the rest of
the way in to bring us the information.

34:15.472 --> 34:17.536
What's the current status?

34:17.637 --> 34:21.811
Well, Specialist Tyler seems to think that
it's a relatively minor mechanical problem,

34:21.911 --> 34:24.981
something like a broken fuel line.

34:25.081 --> 34:29.318
He's standing security there, but he
can't call for help. No radio in the truck.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.454
Well, QRF from Renegade
should be handling that.

34:31.554 --> 34:35.190
Yeah, and maybe they haul
his truck back to Renegade.

34:35.291 --> 34:38.226
We need that fuel and ammo
more than they do right now.

34:38.327 --> 34:42.543
So I want you to get out there,
find that truck, help Tyler get it fixed

34:42.643 --> 34:44.634
and roll it back here.

34:44.934 --> 34:46.918
Take Vasquez, take Jennings.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.973
Bashir will show you the way.
Any questions?

34:50.072 --> 34:52.375
- I got one, sir.
- Yeah?

34:53.324 --> 34:57.313
- What about Abdul Azim Abad?
- What about him?

34:57.413 --> 35:02.251
He's on our top ten hit list of bad guys,
and he's operating in that AO.

35:02.351 --> 35:05.515
- How do you know that?
- Folks talk in their sleep, sir.

35:07.155 --> 35:08.757
Look, you might as well know.

35:08.857 --> 35:12.028
When Congressman Cooper
came up here, he had an agenda.

35:12.128 --> 35:16.398
The whole idea was to prove that all our
efforts are a big waste of time and money.

35:16.498 --> 35:19.569
He insisted on visiting an isolated
or abandoned village,

35:19.669 --> 35:21.400
and we only had one of those in our AO.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.685
- Matubahk.
- Yeah.

35:23.785 --> 35:27.298
- Now you get out there and find that truck.
- Yes, sir.

35:28.244 --> 35:30.045
Vic.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.864
JR?

35:32.314 --> 35:34.250
If you can't get that truck rolling,

35:34.350 --> 35:37.320
pull what cargo you can
and blow the rest in place.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.922
We got very little time and a lot to do.

35:40.022 --> 35:42.869
Roger that, sir. Let's go, guys.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.457
Jake?

35:59.207 --> 36:01.466
I'm burning up, man.

36:03.012 --> 36:05.204
I know.

36:08.785 --> 36:11.553
Listen, I gotta go.

36:12.153 --> 36:13.890
You're not leaving me, are you?

36:13.990 --> 36:18.649
No. I'm going to get
Doc's med pack and some water.

36:22.598 --> 36:26.325
Use this. Just don't shoot the wrong guys.

36:28.087 --> 36:30.089
Roger that.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.264
All right.

36:54.663 --> 36:57.134
I'll just wait right here. (CHUCKLES)

37:10.179 --> 37:12.181
I haven't been out this way
in almost a year.

37:12.281 --> 37:14.917
Looks like a great place for an ambush.

37:15.017 --> 37:18.940
Hardly anybody uses it anymore.
It turns into a dirt road just up ahead.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.675
Let's just try not to hit any IEDs
while we're out here, huh?

37:22.775 --> 37:24.533
Yeah, you got it.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.836
- I don't like it.
- How's that?

37:33.936 --> 37:38.474
Convoy gets hit by a... IED ambush,

37:38.574 --> 37:41.777
and the one vehicle
that has all the munitions

37:41.877 --> 37:45.881
and supplies that we need
goes all Evel Knievel and escapes,

37:45.981 --> 37:48.940
but breaks down before it can get to us.

37:55.590 --> 37:57.760
You think maybe this is a setup?

37:57.860 --> 38:00.196
I don't know, V.

38:00.296 --> 38:02.121
Maybe.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.394
Hey, look.

38:12.008 --> 38:15.344
I don't see our boy Tyler yet,
so don't get too close.

38:15.444 --> 38:17.702
Go ahead, stop.

38:42.638 --> 38:44.039
Bashir.

38:44.139 --> 38:47.710
- You know Specialist Tyler, right?
- Yes, Sergeant.

38:47.810 --> 38:50.546
Go ahead and walk on out there
and call his name.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.981
Excuse me?

38:53.081 --> 38:55.551
About halfway between here and there.

38:55.651 --> 38:57.386
We'll cover you.

38:57.486 --> 39:00.745
- As you wish.
- Go on.

39:09.631 --> 39:11.356
Be ready, boys.

39:26.211 --> 39:28.420
He seems awfully jumpy.

39:29.450 --> 39:33.446
- I might be too.
- Yeah. Point taken.

39:53.776 --> 39:56.034
Mr. Tyler?

39:58.314 --> 39:59.915
- (CAMERA CLICKING)
- Huh?

40:03.753 --> 40:06.889
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- This is perfect.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.758
Get back in the truck.

40:08.858 --> 40:11.927
This is what I came here for.
Don't you try to stop me now.

40:13.127 --> 40:15.364
I'll wring your scrawny little neck.

40:15.464 --> 40:17.667
Sounds like fun,
but I don't think my uncle would like it.

40:17.767 --> 40:19.068
Stay behind me.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.054
Mr. Tyler, are you still here?

40:23.004 --> 40:25.663
MAN: Freeze right where you are!

40:28.043 --> 40:30.434
Hands behind your head!

40:30.646 --> 40:33.939
It's me, Bashir. I brought help.

40:36.118 --> 40:38.477
Hey, Bashir, buddy.

40:40.156 --> 40:42.060
I didn't know who it was at first.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.027
Sorry, man. I was kind of a sitting duck
out here right now, you know?

40:45.127 --> 40:47.730
I understand completely.

40:47.830 --> 40:50.174
All right, let's get on with this.

40:53.101 --> 40:55.401
Brother, am I glad to see you boys.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.559
- Need a hand, Specialist Tyler?
- Need a fuel line.

40:59.659 --> 41:03.478
- What makes you think it's a fuel line?
- Well, I'm out of gas, and I shouldn't be.

41:03.578 --> 41:05.781
Might be a hole in the tank,
but I didn't see one.

41:05.881 --> 41:07.216
She turns over okay?

41:07.316 --> 41:09.451
No, everything's in perfect
working order, except...

41:09.551 --> 41:11.187
- You're out of gas.
- Right.

41:11.287 --> 41:14.123
I got more gas than I need
in the back of the truck, but...

41:14.223 --> 41:16.792
not gonna do anyone any good there.

41:16.892 --> 41:20.151
All right. Let's go take a look, Jennings.

41:23.833 --> 41:26.123
Do you mind?

41:27.419 --> 41:30.850
Could you guys shake hands again?
One more time.

41:33.508 --> 41:35.800
Oh, that's so good.

41:36.412 --> 41:38.447
All right, Jennings,
get us out of here ASAP.

41:38.547 --> 41:40.839
I'll figure it out.

41:43.852 --> 41:45.551
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

41:48.857 --> 41:50.593
Oh, dear God.

41:51.593 --> 41:54.165
- Just about to tell you about her.
- (BABY CRYING)

41:57.065 --> 41:58.700
Yeah, that too.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.169
(CRYING CONTINUES)

42:01.170 --> 42:03.539
Specialist Tyler...

42:03.939 --> 42:05.864
could I have a word with you in private?

42:07.243 --> 42:09.111
Absolutely.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.460
(CRYING CONTINUES)

42:49.385 --> 42:51.678
All right, Specialist...

42:53.385 --> 42:55.139
lay it on me.

42:55.239 --> 43:00.311
Well, I lost my escort around 0400 hours.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.599
I was lucky to have gotten around
the lead vehicle, so I went off-road.

43:03.699 --> 43:07.936
Figure that's where I picked up
the damage. Radio took a hit.

43:08.036 --> 43:12.141
About an hour after sunup, she comes
running out in the middle of the road.

43:12.241 --> 43:18.079
I almost ran her over. She, uh...
hit the ground pretty hard, so I stopped.

43:18.179 --> 43:21.787
She was a wreck, Sergeant.
She was crying, begging for help.

43:22.217 --> 43:24.864
Bashir said she wasn't
making any sense, and...

43:24.964 --> 43:27.222
that's when we discovered
she had that baby hidden there.

43:27.322 --> 43:31.192
- Anybody chasing her?
- No, I mean, not that we could see.

43:31.292 --> 43:34.930
I don't even know where she came from.
There's not a lot back in these hills.

43:35.030 --> 43:38.467
- That's all?
- That's it.

43:38.567 --> 43:42.471
I mean, you know, without a radio
in the truck, I didn't know what to do.

43:42.571 --> 43:47.376
And with the baby and all, I just...
just put her out of sight in the back.

43:48.076 --> 43:51.367
We continued on to Wildside,
then this happened.

43:51.647 --> 43:53.449
Hmm.

43:53.549 --> 43:56.452
That's one hell of a story, Specialist.

43:56.552 --> 43:58.209
It's all true.

44:13.569 --> 44:16.838
It's just a camera.
We won't hurt you. That's it.

44:17.338 --> 44:19.397
Tell her.

44:20.075 --> 44:21.837
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

44:25.581 --> 44:27.649
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

44:28.149 --> 44:30.215
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

44:31.480 --> 44:33.104
(BABY COOS)

44:35.223 --> 44:38.159
- Well?
- It's very hard to interpret.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.396
She speaks one of the minor languages.

44:40.546 --> 44:44.383
Sansi, I think. Very hard to make out.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.091
Great.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.572
Well, she knows we'll help her,

44:50.672 --> 44:53.742
or she wouldn't have flagged
Specialist Tyler down.

44:54.442 --> 44:58.514
Conrad, go back to the other vehicle
and go get her some food and water.

44:58.614 --> 45:01.016
- What?
- You found your way on this mission.

45:01.116 --> 45:04.909
Now you're part of it.
Now move your ass. Let's go.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.480
- Sergeant Jennings?
- Yeah.

45:11.580 --> 45:14.029
Your nickname is Detroit
because you're good with cars, right?

45:14.129 --> 45:16.975
- That's the rumor.
- Get your butt under this Deuce-and-a-half,

45:17.075 --> 45:19.334
find the problem so we can
get the hell out of here.

45:19.434 --> 45:22.614
- I'm on it.
- I'll help you.

45:26.574 --> 45:28.043
Bashir?

45:29.243 --> 45:33.582
- Why didn't you tell us about her?
- Sergeant, there are many like her.

45:33.682 --> 45:36.051
I didn't think it was
of any real importance.

45:36.151 --> 45:39.421
All I could think of
was helping Mr. Tyler.

45:39.521 --> 45:44.025
Now, is there anything else
that you have failed to mention to me?

45:44.325 --> 45:47.062
No, sir. I am very sorry.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.614
(WHISTLES)

45:48.714 --> 45:54.175
Wow. There's enough gas and ammo
in here to blow us all to hell.

45:56.386 --> 45:58.213
Or start a small war.

46:07.448 --> 46:10.809
- Is something wrong?
- I can't find the MREs.

46:26.234 --> 46:28.125
Thanks.

46:31.506 --> 46:34.175
That was some crazy stunt
you pulled, Miss Conrad.

46:34.275 --> 46:38.279
- Why would you do a thing like that?
- Pearls don't lie on the seashore, Detroit.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.806
If you want one, you gotta dive for it.

46:42.550 --> 46:46.423
- This one?
- Yeah, that's it.

46:46.788 --> 46:48.513
Hey.

46:49.958 --> 46:53.951
I feel kind of naked out here.
You mind sharing?

46:54.696 --> 46:56.598
I shouldn't.

46:56.698 --> 46:59.710
But under the circumstances...

47:00.410 --> 47:02.225
here.

47:02.738 --> 47:04.296
(SIGHS)

47:04.396 --> 47:06.198
Thanks.

47:13.015 --> 47:16.441
- How's it going?
- Nothing yet.

47:23.825 --> 47:27.351
You give 'em to her.
You're less threatening.

47:30.132 --> 47:32.357
Less threatening?

47:34.336 --> 47:35.670
(CHUCKLES)

47:35.770 --> 47:37.740
Yeah, you're a lot less threatening.

47:37.840 --> 47:41.510
Now put that away
and don't shoot yourself and jinx us.

47:42.010 --> 47:45.246
You're getting your very own article
out of this, Sergeant.

47:45.746 --> 47:47.583
I can't wait.

47:47.683 --> 47:50.019
I happen to be an expert marksman.

47:50.119 --> 47:52.211
Can you say the same?

48:09.304 --> 48:12.441
Jake. How'd it go?

48:12.541 --> 48:14.733
Good for now.

48:29.157 --> 48:32.324
- What's the short of it, Jennings?
- We got a problem.

48:32.994 --> 48:36.231
- Not that short. Can you fix it?
- I think so.

48:36.331 --> 48:39.668
I gotta swap out a section
of this line and see if it'll hold.

48:39.768 --> 48:41.437
And that's it? You'll be done?

48:41.537 --> 48:44.306
Maybe. I won't know
until I do it and then I test it.

48:44.406 --> 48:45.975
ETA.

48:46.275 --> 48:49.328
I gotta cut out the old line first
and then I'll know more.

48:49.428 --> 48:52.031
Better have some good news for us soon.

48:52.181 --> 48:54.483
I'd hate to have to blow this truck up.

48:54.583 --> 48:57.887
- I'm doing my best.
- We know, son.

48:58.437 --> 49:01.442
Just get it done, Jennings.
We gotta get outta here.

49:06.962 --> 49:09.214
Okay, Bashir.

49:09.314 --> 49:11.773
- Let's try this one more time.
- Yes, Sergeant.

49:16.872 --> 49:20.375
- How's it going back here?
- We're doing fine.

49:20.475 --> 49:22.367
I think she trusts me.

49:26.047 --> 49:29.951
Good, because I need you to
check her out medically and otherwise.

49:30.051 --> 49:33.021
Make sure she's okay
before we take her into Wildside.

49:33.121 --> 49:36.758
I'll give it a shot.
I don't have any experience at this.

49:37.158 --> 49:38.960
You.

49:39.460 --> 49:43.565
Make her understand. I don't care
if you have to act it out or what.

49:43.665 --> 49:44.699
Yes, sir.

49:44.799 --> 49:48.660
Don't call me "sir." I work for
a goddamn living. Get in the truck.

49:56.111 --> 49:58.210
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

49:59.614 --> 50:01.666
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

50:07.522 --> 50:10.447
- Got it.
- Nice.

50:14.896 --> 50:16.348
Well?

50:16.448 --> 50:20.452
- I gotta cut a piece of line, replace this.
- Don't look like much.

50:20.802 --> 50:24.272
You'd be surprised how much trouble
a little part can cause.

50:24.372 --> 50:26.938
Well, don't let me stop you,
Jennings. Get it done.

50:27.408 --> 50:30.409
- I'll help you cut it.
- I got a saw on the truck.

50:33.014 --> 50:34.817
Sergeant?

50:35.317 --> 50:38.754
- Yeah.
- The lady wants you.

50:39.054 --> 50:40.812
Okay.

50:50.565 --> 50:52.133
Yeah, what's up?

50:52.233 --> 50:55.804
Thought you ought to see this.
This is bad.

50:55.904 --> 50:58.573
Hmm. She been whipped.

50:58.673 --> 51:00.842
No wonder she wanted to get away.

51:00.942 --> 51:03.701
Probably punishment for something.

51:05.113 --> 51:08.950
- Any sign of infection?
- Not that I could see.

51:09.050 --> 51:12.001
All right. Well, just do
what you can, then, uh...

51:12.101 --> 51:15.613
check the baby out, make sure he's okay.

51:16.458 --> 51:18.794
And you, wait here with her, all right?

51:18.894 --> 51:21.652
- Of course.
- In the truck.

51:33.007 --> 51:35.271
- How's our guest?
- (SIGHS)

51:35.871 --> 51:38.947
Pretty rough.
Someone whipped the hell out of her,

51:39.047 --> 51:42.851
but nothing a little time
won't heal, I guess.

51:43.551 --> 51:47.088
I guess maybe Tyler
did the right thing after all.

51:47.188 --> 51:51.026
Maybe. Maybe not.

51:51.126 --> 51:53.896
One thing he was right about...

51:54.996 --> 51:57.464
- We are sitting ducks out here.

51:57.564 --> 52:00.525
- Contact!
- Heads up!

52:05.273 --> 52:08.134
- Go. Get down.
- (GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

52:14.048 --> 52:16.573
How many you think there are?

52:17.185 --> 52:20.144
Not enough to rush us. Not yet anyway.

52:32.234 --> 52:35.003
Jennings, Tyler, sitrep!

52:35.103 --> 52:38.395
- A-okay!
- Good to go!

52:43.011 --> 52:46.237
- Conrad!
- All good.

52:54.239 --> 52:56.097
Reload!

52:57.392 --> 52:58.783
Up!

52:59.995 --> 53:01.763
Get back here.

- Vasquez!
- Let me go!

53:04.499 --> 53:06.790
Stay put.

53:11.005 --> 53:12.874
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

53:12.974 --> 53:15.410
You do realize we're sitting
on a powder keg here.

53:15.510 --> 53:19.670
One wild shot hits those explosives
back there, boom!

53:27.555 --> 53:30.158
V, I've gotta make it
to that Deuce-and-a-half.

53:30.258 --> 53:33.729
I'm gonna bring it back here
as a shield for this truck.

53:34.729 --> 53:36.848
That's suicide, Vic.

53:36.948 --> 53:38.883
Jennings!

53:38.983 --> 53:41.306
I gotta make it to your truck
and bring it back here.

53:41.406 --> 53:43.338
Sergeant, let me go.

53:43.438 --> 53:46.641
Are you sure you can bring the truck
back alongside this truck?

53:46.741 --> 53:48.543
- I can try.
- Alright.

53:48.643 --> 53:51.119
- We'll give as much cover fire as we can.
- Roger that.

53:51.219 --> 53:53.868
Tyler! You got any
smoke grenades in the back?

53:53.968 --> 53:56.618
- Negative, Sarge!
- All right, Jennings.

- Run like the wind, boy. Ready?
- Yeah.

56:19.961 --> 56:23.097
Good work, Jennings. All right, Conrad.

56:23.197 --> 56:26.301
- Let's get baby-mama transferred over.
- Roger that.

56:26.901 --> 56:28.420
What about me, Mosby?

56:28.520 --> 56:30.688
- You can still drive, right?
- Hell yeah, I can.

56:30.788 --> 56:34.659
All right. For now, get your weapon
and put some cover fire on that hillside.

56:34.759 --> 56:37.962
- Roger that.
- Keep your head down.

56:38.212 --> 56:41.316
Hey, V, I need you to set
a demo charge on Tyler's truck.

56:41.416 --> 56:45.829
Use the remote detonators, and we'll
blow it when we're on the road out of here.

56:47.088 --> 56:48.373
(BABY CRYING)

56:48.823 --> 56:51.382
- Come on! We're getting out of here.
- (CRYING CONTINUES)

57:04.522 --> 57:06.602
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

57:27.078 --> 57:31.416
You stay here.
I'll get up there, and I'll pull you up.

57:31.516 --> 57:34.218
You got that? You wait here.

57:34.318 --> 57:36.897
I go first, okay?

57:42.259 --> 57:45.632
You're welcome. Get ready.

57:49.601 --> 57:51.677
(GRUNTS)

57:54.539 --> 57:56.474
(SCREAMING)

57:56.574 --> 57:59.311
Conrad! Check on Conrad.

57:59.911 --> 58:02.236
(SCREAMING)

58:03.681 --> 58:05.453
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

58:18.196 --> 58:20.698
Vasquez, med kit now!

58:20.798 --> 58:22.874
(GROANS)

58:28.106 --> 58:29.874
You okay?

58:29.974 --> 58:31.976
It's just my side.

58:32.076 --> 58:34.587
I think it's just grazed.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.995
Heads up.

58:46.457 --> 58:48.534
(CONRAD GROANS)

59:02.106 --> 59:04.751
Why did it have to be like this?

59:07.411 --> 59:10.916
You'd be long gone by now
if it wasn't for me.

59:11.316 --> 59:12.783
No.

59:13.383 --> 59:16.295
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

59:16.588 --> 59:18.324
Your family...

59:19.324 --> 59:21.626
must worry about you a lot, huh?

59:23.526 --> 59:25.838
I wouldn't know.

59:32.470 --> 59:34.175
Oh.

59:36.174 --> 59:38.776
Sometimes it's good not to know, I guess.

59:38.876 --> 59:41.153
Works for me.

59:43.313 --> 59:45.957
Why are you doing this for me?

59:46.551 --> 59:50.087
I don't know, man.
You kinda remind me of my little brother.

59:50.787 --> 59:54.325
He always tried to do his best.
I'm just doing mine.

59:55.275 --> 59:57.312
He's gone now?

59:58.062 --> 01:00:00.706
Yeah, Desert Storm.

01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:06.404
I'm sorry my best wasn't good enough.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.741
If a man does his best,
what else is there?

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:21.069
We're all set. This thing blows,
there won't be nothing left but the tires.

01:00:21.169 --> 01:00:22.993
Good.

01:00:24.255 --> 01:00:26.161
What happened here?

01:00:26.261 --> 01:00:29.359
Miss Conrad there decided she wanted
to earn herself a Purple Heart.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.662
Didn't do this on purpose.

01:00:30.762 --> 01:00:35.116
Let's keep that blood pressure down
until I stop this bleeding, huh?

01:00:35.216 --> 01:00:38.218
- Hey, Sergeant?
- Yeah.

01:00:38.318 --> 01:00:40.163
Help a girl out?

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:44.351
- My camera.
- Sure.

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:54.785
Don't forget to spell my name right
in the photo credits.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.055
What exactly is your name?

01:00:57.155 --> 01:01:00.057
- Victor.
- Victor?

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:03.728
Victor Thomas Mosby.

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:06.143
I'll remember that.

01:01:11.269 --> 01:01:13.143
Okay. (GROANS)

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:18.544
It sure got quiet all of a sudden.

01:01:18.844 --> 01:01:20.645
Yup.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:24.015
Like somebody flipped a switch.

01:01:24.415 --> 01:01:26.484
Wonder why.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:29.954
You think it was seeing Miss Conrad?

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:33.913
Nope. They shot her easy enough.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.196
- You think it's her?
- - I do, V.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:42.974
When they saw her, it was all over.

01:01:43.601 --> 01:01:47.647
- But why?
- I don't know.

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:50.849
But I'm sure she does.

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:00.726
Grab him, Bashir.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.921
Poor Mr. Tyler.

01:02:20.021 --> 01:02:22.654
He was so very brave.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.411
All right, Mr. Bashir.

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:28.963
Here's what's gonna happen next.

01:02:29.263 --> 01:02:31.565
What do you mean, Sergeant?

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.444
I want to know who that girl is.

01:02:36.904 --> 01:02:39.874
- And I want to know now.
- Sergeant, I already...

01:02:39.974 --> 01:02:42.018
(SHUSHING)

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.966
Here's the deal.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.688
There are dozens of languages
just floating around out here.

01:02:53.788 --> 01:02:56.464
Maybe she knows one of them.

01:02:57.925 --> 01:03:00.448
And we'll never know...

01:03:02.229 --> 01:03:04.232
unless we try.

01:03:05.432 --> 01:03:08.259
Maybe you'll get lucky.

01:03:09.169 --> 01:03:12.459
- Got me?
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:16.786
Get to it. Go.

01:03:25.586 --> 01:03:27.674
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:41.671
What you thinking about, Jake?

01:03:46.006 --> 01:03:49.010
I'm thinking about trying
to get out of here.

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:52.487
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.343
Any ideas?

01:04:01.288 --> 01:04:05.242
Yeah. I'm gonna go downstairs
and commandeer us a truck.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.163
Yeah? When you gonna do that?

01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:11.306
Right now.

01:04:15.836 --> 01:04:17.860

01:04:22.142 --> 01:04:23.953
Anything?

01:04:24.612 --> 01:04:27.257
Maybe. Been at it for a while.

01:04:29.216 --> 01:04:31.869
Jennings, how's it going under there?

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.338
Almost there, Sergeant.

01:04:34.588 --> 01:04:36.398
Bashir?

01:04:37.524 --> 01:04:40.361
- Well?
- She speaks some Dani.

01:04:40.661 --> 01:04:45.032
- What'd you find out?
- You'll be very surprised, Sergeant.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:50.238
Her name is Jada. She's the daughter-in-law
of the Taliban leader, Abdul Azim Abad.

01:04:50.338 --> 01:04:54.541
- A very powerful, very evil man.
- Yeah, we know who he is.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:58.553
And that is his only grandson.

01:04:58.913 --> 01:05:02.220
- Well, how about that.
- You think she's telling the truth?

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.319
You saw how those rebels reacted
when they got a look at her.

01:05:05.419 --> 01:05:07.754
They fell back like
their asses were on fire.

01:05:07.854 --> 01:05:12.126
Well... I think she's telling the truth.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:15.429
And if she is telling the truth...

01:05:16.629 --> 01:05:19.716
- she's worth her weight in gold.
- What are you saying?

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:23.928
Sergeant Jennings...
soon as you get finished under there,

01:05:24.028 --> 01:05:26.716
I want you in the front of the vehicle.
I want you in the rear of the vehicle.

01:05:26.816 --> 01:05:29.663
I want you guys to keep your eyes open
and your heads down.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:34.031
Now that they know we have her,
this isn't the end of it.

01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:35.987
Roger that.

01:05:36.337 --> 01:05:39.064
V, let's go for a walk.

01:05:44.678 --> 01:05:46.389

What's on your mind, Vic?

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:56.790
What's on my mind is Cannon and Chandler.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:59.060
They're waiting on us back in Matubahk.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.964
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. Just hear me out.

01:06:05.064 --> 01:06:07.535
(SIGHS) Vic, you can't be
thinking what I'm thinking.

01:06:07.835 --> 01:06:12.506
Look... Old Abdul's
daughter-in-law there...

01:06:12.606 --> 01:06:16.177
she's our ticket to waltz
right back in to Matubahk,

01:06:16.277 --> 01:06:19.430
extract our boys
without even firing a shot.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.905
Are you serious?

01:06:22.205 --> 01:06:24.852
You would use that lady
and her baby as a human shield?

01:06:24.952 --> 01:06:26.587
Of course not.

01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:30.892
I'd just have 'em along,
keep things peaceful, civilized.

01:06:31.192 --> 01:06:34.495
- That's insane.
- Is it?

01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:36.664
I got a truck sitting right there

01:06:36.764 --> 01:06:40.601
with enough firepower to blow old Abdul
and his boys to kingdom come.

01:06:40.701 --> 01:06:43.901
Now I got two things that he really wants.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.842
- This will cost you big.
- You kidding me?

01:06:48.942 --> 01:06:51.030
I'm already out 60 bucks.

01:07:28.415 --> 01:07:32.052
- Beeline.
- MAN: <i>This is COP Wildside. Identify yourself.</i>

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:35.456
Beeline, this is Overwatch
waiting for extraction.

01:07:35.556 --> 01:07:38.755
<i>Copy, Overwatch. Message received.</i>

01:07:50.254 --> 01:07:52.657
Colonel, this just came in.

01:07:53.707 --> 01:07:57.544
Well, thank Christ. I swear,
Chandler's got more lives than a cat.

01:07:57.644 --> 01:08:01.157
- Make sure I see all the traffic on this.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:09.289
All right, everybody, listen up.

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:11.562
This is what's gonna happen.

01:08:11.662 --> 01:08:13.914
Sergeant Jennings...

01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:17.798
very carefully, is going to take
everybody back to Wildside.

01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:20.921
I'm going to take command
of Tyler's vehicle.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.603
- Roger that.
- As soon as you arrive at Wildside,

01:08:23.703 --> 01:08:27.407
I want you to inform Colonel Jackson
that I elected to take a slight detour

01:08:27.506 --> 01:08:31.479
and reunite this young lady
and her baby with her family,

01:08:31.578 --> 01:08:34.631
and that I will be following
shortly thereafter.

01:08:34.732 --> 01:08:37.648
- All right, anybody have any questions?
- Yeah. Hell yeah.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:41.269
Sorry, Conrad, we're out of time.
Godspeed.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:43.608
Detroit.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:47.395
- You're in charge now.
- Sergeant?

01:08:49.496 --> 01:08:52.866
I can't leave you sitting
in the brig all by your lonesome.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:55.169
Who'd you have to boss around?

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.095
Thanks.

01:08:59.173 --> 01:09:02.584
All right, let's gear up and move out.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.143
Get timers and blasting caps.

01:10:05.006 --> 01:10:06.849
Here.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.029
- Five minutes.
- Meet you in the square.

01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:55.555
Rich. Rich, wake up, man.

01:10:55.655 --> 01:10:58.528
Cavalry's just arrived. Be ready.

01:11:07.985 --> 01:11:11.157
Don't run out on me, little brother.
We're almost home, ya hear?

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:45.347
(BEEPS)

01:12:33.019 --> 01:12:36.500
Well... that answers one of my questions.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.482
And that answers the other.

01:12:45.882 --> 01:12:48.152
Halfway back up the street, right side.

01:12:48.252 --> 01:12:50.863
Rooftop, Sergeant Chandler.

01:12:53.924 --> 01:12:56.093
I can hardly wait to see
what happens next.

01:12:56.193 --> 01:12:58.309
Let's get to it.

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:23.921
Oh, look, proud grandpa.

01:13:24.021 --> 01:13:25.756
At least I hope he is.

01:13:25.856 --> 01:13:29.627
You should. Your life depends on it.

01:13:37.434 --> 01:13:39.036
Good luck, buddy.

01:13:39.136 --> 01:13:42.598
Hey, who needs luck when you've got a...

01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:45.216
rabbit's foot?

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.018
Here we go.

01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:25.857
How.

01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:28.519
Very amusing, Sergeant.

01:14:28.619 --> 01:14:32.330
Just like I figured.
Educated in the States.

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:35.793
Four years Liberal Arts. Scholarship.

01:14:37.293 --> 01:14:40.364
- You?
- Four years, high school.

01:14:41.164 --> 01:14:43.633
(SCOFFS)

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:47.054
All right, have your men put
their weapons on the ground,

01:14:47.154 --> 01:14:49.857
put their hands behind their head...

01:14:49.957 --> 01:14:52.198
and then we'll get
this whole matter all...

01:14:52.298 --> 01:14:55.132
- wrapped up, nobody gets hurt.
- (LAUGHS)

01:14:57.982 --> 01:15:00.551
You truly are a very funny man.

01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:02.986
Well...

01:15:04.286 --> 01:15:07.728
your daughter-in-law
sure seems to think so.

01:15:08.491 --> 01:15:11.562
And what a handsome grandson you have.

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.733
Yup, he has your eyes, all right.

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:18.606
He is very dear to me.

01:15:18.706 --> 01:15:21.805
My only son Emir
was killed not too long ago.

01:15:22.755 --> 01:15:24.408
Very tragic.

01:15:24.508 --> 01:15:28.788
And you think your son Amir
would approve of you whipping Jada?

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.792
She made some bad decisions.

01:15:56.072 --> 01:15:57.955
Interesting.

01:15:59.944 --> 01:16:02.427
An animal's foot...

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.548
for good fortune?

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:08.093
Well, you'd have to ask
the rabbit about that.

01:16:11.554 --> 01:16:15.574
Get Jada and my grandson to me now...

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:20.271

01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:27.078
Is that your best offer?

01:16:29.606 --> 01:16:32.953
Okay, then. Stand by.

01:16:44.688 --> 01:16:46.513
Well?

01:16:48.859 --> 01:16:51.161
- Let her go.
- What?

01:16:51.261 --> 01:16:54.107
- Let her go. What choice do we have?
- (SIGHS)

01:17:22.056 --> 01:17:24.185
Rot in hell, motherfucker!

01:17:44.313 --> 01:17:46.390
Get back!

01:18:11.341 --> 01:18:13.218
Reload!

01:18:58.856 --> 01:19:01.770
Vasquez, blow it!

01:19:05.345 --> 01:19:07.988
Come on, come on.

01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:16.300
VASQUEZ: Detonator fail!

01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:14.983
(CAMERA CLICKING)

01:20:22.039 --> 01:20:24.074
You know...

01:20:25.074 --> 01:20:27.477
we're gonna be in
a lot of trouble for all this.

01:20:27.777 --> 01:20:29.588
Probably.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.674
Most definitely.

01:20:34.768 --> 01:20:36.921
I, uh...

01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.209
I just want to say, uh...

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:44.135
thank you.

01:20:44.627 --> 01:20:46.295
And?

01:20:46.395 --> 01:20:48.936
You're not a jinx.

01:20:49.036 --> 01:20:51.534
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

01:20:51.634 --> 01:20:55.505
- Besides, my uncle is an admiral.
- That's right, he is.

01:20:55.605 --> 01:20:58.942
So maybe you could put a good word in
for me. I'm definitely gonna need it.

01:20:59.042 --> 01:21:01.493
I could be persuaded.

01:21:01.845 --> 01:21:03.877
Your exclusive story rights.

01:21:03.977 --> 01:21:06.000
(CHUCKLES)

01:21:07.956 --> 01:21:12.522
All right, you win.
What do you need from me?

01:21:12.622 --> 01:21:16.491
Well, we could start
with a big hero smile.

01:21:19.096 --> 01:21:20.972
Okay.

01:21:28.105 --> 01:21:29.914
All right.

01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:41.392
Okay.

01:21:42.619 --> 01:21:44.862
Right here.

01:21:49.893 --> 01:21:51.862
Ohh.

01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:56.316
Man, what kept you, Vic?
You still sore about that 50 bucks?

01:21:57.066 --> 01:21:59.136
Nope, and it's 60.

01:21:59.236 --> 01:22:03.656
Oh, you gonna be like that now?
After all the times I saved your life.

01:22:03.756 --> 01:22:07.577
- All the times you saved my life?
- That's what people say.

01:22:07.677 --> 01:22:10.613
Yeah, right, and you don't call no more.

01:22:10.713 --> 01:22:12.566
You know why?

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:15.269
We done broke the comms
in all this excitement.

01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:19.923
Yeah, well...

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:22.275
You know what?

01:22:22.425 --> 01:22:25.212
When you get a minute someday,
you're gonna have to tell me about it.

01:22:25.562 --> 01:22:28.499
After you pay me my 60 bucks.

01:22:29.699 --> 01:22:33.683
- Where's Cannon?
- He up there.

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:34.937

01:22:35.037 --> 01:22:37.080
Good to see ya.

01:22:38.908 --> 01:22:41.781
- Sergeant Chandler?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22:42.311 --> 01:22:45.294
Are you really as good
as they all say you are?

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:49.541
Every once in a while.
