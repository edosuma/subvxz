<i>Previously, on</i>
"Good Witch".

00:02.781 --> 00:04.960
The mayor lives 
here.

00:05.048 --> 00:07.249
MY HOUSE IS IN BLAIRSVILLE?!

00:07.337 --> 00:09.257
I've been instructed
to strip you of your title.

00:09.345 --> 00:11.436
Mayor Pershing,
the city is yours.

00:11.524 --> 00:13.212
I remember making this
for Daddy.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.999
- You miss him?
- Yes.

00:17.087 --> 00:20.212
I wanted to ask if it would be
OK if I married your mother.

00:20.575 --> 00:21.766
Yes!

00:21.854 --> 00:24.087
You know, I've been out of the dating
game for so long,

00:24.265 --> 00:26.953
- I don't know, how to get back in it.
- I'm sure you'll find yourself

00:27.040 --> 00:29.499
- with plenty of options.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

00:29.587 --> 00:32.177
I'm sorry, Abigail. I know we kind
of had something started here,

00:32.266 --> 00:35.173
- but I found a place in Portland.
- OK then.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.601
- What's wrong?
- The whole place

00:36.689 --> 00:37.804
is under three feet of water!

00:37.891 --> 00:40.303
- Our wedding!
- Can't believe we have to wait.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.624
Let's not give up.
We'll find the perfect place.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.243
I would never give up.

00:53.399 --> 00:54.757
It's a bottomless pit in here.

00:54.845 --> 00:56.391
Oh, stop it.

00:56.574 --> 00:58.407
I'm used to you surprising me,

00:58.723 --> 01:01.030
it's one of the things
I love about you,

01:01.259 --> 01:04.186
but I never imagined you'd have
a junk room that's so messy.

01:04.274 --> 01:06.444
Uh, this is not junk;
they're mementoes

01:06.532 --> 01:09.499
and I know where everything is.
I have no doubt.

01:09.594 --> 01:11.788
Well, since Nick moves
in here, all the mementoes

01:11.876 --> 01:13.538
will be replaced
with videogames.

01:13.626 --> 01:15.032
When that kid's
not battling aliens;

01:15.120 --> 01:16.992
he's talking
about battling aliens.

01:17.221 --> 01:20.444
Active imagination is fuel
for a creative soul.

01:20.532 --> 01:22.639
Yeah, well, not sure
that's gonna fly

01:22.727 --> 01:24.271
on college applications.

01:24.358 --> 01:26.024
At least, not the ones
that he filled out

01:26.112 --> 01:28.468
- and never sent in.
- Yeah, there's still time.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.453
I've tried tough love.
I've tried being cool dad.

01:31.541 --> 01:34.580
Ah, but you haven't tried
being awesome new stepmom.

01:34.807 --> 01:36.799
You think you can work
your magic on Nick?

01:37.182 --> 01:39.516
Oh, I knew there was a reason
I was marrying you.

01:39.604 --> 01:41.252
- Is that the only reason?
- No.

01:41.355 --> 01:43.416
- Do tell.
- I'll tell you in two days.

01:43.822 --> 01:45.292
Can you believe
it's finally happening?

01:45.379 --> 01:48.078
- Shhh! Don't jinx it.
- OK.

01:50.337 --> 01:52.916
Stop distracting me,
we'll never get this done.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.854
Ohhh...

02:01.164 --> 02:03.971
I haven't seen this
in a long time.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.880
Wow!

02:10.181 --> 02:11.492
Who are they?

02:12.143 --> 02:14.495
My great-great-great-
grandmother Catherine Merriwick

02:14.582 --> 02:16.889
and her husband Douglas.

02:16.976 --> 02:19.330
They got married
under the Forever Tree.

02:19.463 --> 02:21.198
On their wedding day,
they carved their initials

02:21.285 --> 02:23.859
inside a heart on the trunk,
which means

02:23.947 --> 02:25.940
- their love will last...
- Forever.

02:26.682 --> 02:28.683
Look. The name kind of gave it away.

02:29.009 --> 02:30.816
A lot of people have carved
their initials in trees.

02:30.903 --> 02:33.977
Not a tree that's lived
for thousands of years.

02:34.065 --> 02:35.541
Legend has it
that the roots

02:35.629 --> 02:38.692
never stopped growing.
They go so deep into the ground

02:38.780 --> 02:42.205
that the tree will be here
for all time.

02:43.158 --> 02:45.729
- Where is it?
- No one knows.

02:46.197 --> 02:49.830
Most believe that the tree
has been lost to the ages.

02:49.963 --> 02:51.510
What do you believe?

02:52.251 --> 02:56.151
When the time is right,
the Forever Tree will reveal itself.

03:21.091 --> 03:22.980
That's it.
Alright now, careful.

03:23.068 --> 03:24.957
Keep it moving,
but most importantly,

03:25.044 --> 03:26.638
keep it clean.

03:27.177 --> 03:28.331
Oh my.

03:28.419 --> 03:31.184
Who has the long-handle duster?

03:32.208 --> 03:35.112
Isn't it just so romantic
that Sam and Cassie

03:35.200 --> 03:37.143
went horseback riding here
on their first date,

03:37.231 --> 03:39.099
and now they're
getting married here?

03:39.187 --> 03:40.794
It really is beautiful.

03:41.224 --> 03:43.833
It will be even more beautiful
with flowers everywhere.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.737
Um, well, nobody will be
looking at the flowers

03:46.825 --> 03:48.316
after they taste the food.
Please!

03:48.404 --> 03:50.793
We both know flowers as the most
important part of a wedding.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.058
I doubt 50 hungry guests
would agree with that.

03:53.146 --> 03:54.933
Um, 48 to be exact.

03:55.021 --> 03:56.784
Oh, right,
I forgot my plus one

03:56.872 --> 03:59.987
- is back with his ex-wife.
- Mm. At least, Liam left you

04:00.075 --> 04:03.038
for a good reason. Phil chose
his dating app company over me.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.636
- He did come back for you.
- Like I was ever gonna move

04:05.724 --> 04:08.089
to Portland.
My flower shop is here.

04:08.177 --> 04:11.911
- You're also the mayor.
- Which is taking my entire day.

04:12.013 --> 04:15.005
I have to figure out how to fund
the new playground equipment,

04:15.113 --> 04:18.822
I'm up to my ears in paperwork,
and my phone is ringing

04:18.934 --> 04:21.081
off the hook with constituents
calling me all day.

04:21.168 --> 04:23.607
- I wouldn't want to do it.
- Do what?

04:24.068 --> 04:26.511
Move to Portland.
I hear they get a lot of rain.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.800
Oh, well, Phil's loss
is Middleton's gain.

04:29.888 --> 04:33.894
We couldn't have a better
interim mayor in my absence.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.681
- What do you want, Martha?
- Well, since you asked,

04:36.768 --> 04:38.599
my job back.

04:38.856 --> 04:42.901
You need to get this Blairsville
town line nonsense fixed,

04:42.989 --> 04:45.685
so my house can be
returned to Middleton.

04:45.833 --> 04:49.466
If I were you, I would embrace
my time away from city hall.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.058
You don't have to be mayor
to be... Martha.

04:52.146 --> 04:55.743
Oh, you think I'd be used
to you just popping up by now.

04:55.830 --> 04:59.403
No, no, no, no.
Candles on the sidewalls only.

04:59.685 --> 05:01.582
You should start planning
weddings again, Martha;

05:01.669 --> 05:04.440
- you have a knack for it.
- No. That phase of my life

05:04.528 --> 05:06.620
is over. I'm just doing this
as a favour to Cassie.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.411
I appreciate your help,
but I'd much rather

05:08.499 --> 05:11.612
- you enjoy yourself as our guest.
- But how would I enjoy myself

05:11.700 --> 05:14.284
- if I have nothing to do?
- Quite the conundrum.

05:14.372 --> 05:17.263
Or quite the opportunity.

05:17.747 --> 05:19.332
You're right, Cassie.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.372
Perhaps Martha Tinsdale
needs to reinvent herself.

05:22.544 --> 05:24.933
You could start by helping me
out at Bell, Book & Candle.

05:25.021 --> 05:26.737
There's been a recent opening.

05:26.825 --> 05:28.646
Excuse me.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.292
Hmm!

05:30.646 --> 05:32.534
Dad, you're about
to get married;

05:32.622 --> 05:34.395
are we seriously gonna talk
about college now?

05:34.482 --> 05:36.828
Well, there's still two days
to the wedding and I'm off work,

05:36.915 --> 05:39.787
- what are we gonna talk about?
- Anything else. Please.

05:39.874 --> 05:42.558
Fair enough. But your grandma
and grandpa might ask

05:42.646 --> 05:44.966
about your plans, and they'll be
here in a couple of hours.

05:45.255 --> 05:47.714
Oh, great.
Now, I'm getting it from all sides.

05:47.802 --> 05:49.278
- Getting what?
- Whole college

05:49.366 --> 05:50.856
what-are-you-gonna-do-with-your-life thing.

05:50.943 --> 05:53.927
Hmmm... Well,
I promise not to ask.

05:54.185 --> 05:56.599
At least,
not about college.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.855
Could you go grab
a ladder for me?

05:58.950 --> 06:00.809
I need it to finish
hanging the lights.

06:00.919 --> 06:02.974
I saw one up
by the horse stables.

06:03.441 --> 06:05.960
- Gladly.
- I'll take that.

06:09.918 --> 06:11.225
So you're gonna get him
to take college

06:11.312 --> 06:14.419
more seriously by promising
not to talk about college?

06:16.231 --> 06:17.622
Interesting strategy.

06:17.896 --> 06:20.943
You don't always need to talk
to get someone to listen.

06:32.012 --> 06:33.271
Nice horse!

06:33.450 --> 06:36.075
Thanks!
She's a great jumper.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.341
Cool jacket!

06:39.427 --> 06:40.542
I'm Lyndsay.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.633
I'm getting married.
I... I mean

06:42.720 --> 06:44.823
my dad's getting married.

06:44.911 --> 06:47.294
I'm Nick.
Great to meet you.

06:47.435 --> 06:49.044
Thanks.

06:52.265 --> 06:54.809
OK. Man of few words.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.778
I came looking
for a ladder.

06:58.044 --> 06:59.917
Just on the side of the barn.

07:00.723 --> 07:02.783
Easy, Starfire.

07:03.068 --> 07:04.698
Starfire?

07:05.606 --> 07:08.190
Like from the game Destination?

07:08.278 --> 07:09.943
Is there another Starfire?

07:10.505 --> 07:13.169
- I'm on level 4.
- Me too.

07:23.114 --> 07:24.565
It's a new horse.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.504
He's been really restless,
and no one can get near him yet.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.309
Wow!

07:34.450 --> 07:37.730
Um... I guess I'll see you.

07:38.005 --> 07:39.943
Oh! You forgot
the ladder.

07:40.934 --> 07:43.317
Oh! Yeah.

08:19.601 --> 08:21.335
Hi.

08:22.046 --> 08:23.506
Hello.

08:28.419 --> 08:30.029
Hey, get back!

08:31.335 --> 08:33.657
Shhh... Shhh...

08:34.111 --> 08:36.980
- Shhh... Shhh...
- Grace!

08:37.150 --> 08:38.765
Hey, are you OK?

08:39.010 --> 08:40.402
Yeah.

08:40.505 --> 08:42.746
I'm fine. I just...

08:43.707 --> 08:46.050
Just not sure he is.

08:57.556 --> 09:00.917
- Vincent?!
- What's up, Cass?

09:01.027 --> 09:02.665
Look at you!

09:02.753 --> 09:04.806
- I look good, right?
- Yeah!

09:04.894 --> 09:07.837
I'll let you two get caught up.
It was nice talking to you.

09:07.925 --> 09:10.095
Yeah, you too.
You ever get out to the coast,

09:10.183 --> 09:13.348
- we'll sail the Catalina.
- I'll hold you to that.

09:13.972 --> 09:16.119
- What are you doing here?
- Didn't you invite me?

09:16.207 --> 09:18.978
Well, we did,
but you never RSVP'd.

09:19.066 --> 09:21.059
- You're right, I should get going.
- No, no, I'm not letting you

09:21.146 --> 09:23.884
- get away again.
- Hey! Who's this?

09:23.972 --> 09:27.298
- Ah, Sam, this is Vincent.
- Ah, the foster brother!

09:27.386 --> 09:28.863
I guess Cass told you
about me.

09:28.988 --> 09:31.947
Yeah. She told me you haven't
been around the past 10 years.

09:32.035 --> 09:34.540
- I'm glad you're here now.
- Me too.

09:34.628 --> 09:36.761
Wait 'til you see Grace.
She's all grown up now.

09:36.949 --> 09:39.613
- That makes two of us.
- Yeah.

09:40.419 --> 09:42.769
- Hmm.
- Wow!

09:43.269 --> 09:45.423
It's so nice having you here,
Uncle Vincent.

09:45.511 --> 09:47.839
I cannot remember
the last time I saw you.

09:47.933 --> 09:51.038
Because he keeps promising
to come and never shows up.

09:51.948 --> 09:53.954
When you're out at sea,
keeping a schedule

09:54.042 --> 09:56.564
can be tough.
The ocean is unforgiving.

09:56.652 --> 09:59.636
But we're not. We are grateful
for all these gifts.

09:59.738 --> 10:03.224
Yes, and I love my...

10:03.311 --> 10:05.575
It's a handmade
harmony ball from Bali.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.665
There's a small bell inside.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.580
When you wear it...

10:10.667 --> 10:13.589
It reminds you to take
a deep breath and relax.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.363
Which is why they're also
used for meditation.

10:17.347 --> 10:18.847
It's cool.

10:19.925 --> 10:21.540
- Your turn, Sam.
- Ah!

10:21.852 --> 10:23.597
Yeah,
what do you got, Dad?

10:23.685 --> 10:27.206
- Uh, let's see. It's a...
- It's a lali

10:27.308 --> 10:30.126
drum from Fiji used to call

10:30.214 --> 10:31.809
people together.
I figured you could use it

10:31.896 --> 10:35.456
to gather the new family.
Or I could send a group text.

10:37.185 --> 10:41.828
Um. Seriously, it's...
it's very thoughtful.

10:43.830 --> 10:46.398
- I... Your turn, Mom.
- Yes, OK.

10:47.932 --> 10:49.847
Let's... see here.

10:50.011 --> 10:51.708
Black pearls.

10:51.839 --> 10:54.232
They're amazing! Look.
Yeah.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.931
I found them when I was sailing
to French Polynesia

10:57.019 --> 10:58.548
last month.
They're supposed to protect

10:58.636 --> 11:00.793
- the wearer from negative energy.
- Not too much of that

11:00.880 --> 11:03.347
- around Cassie.
- Hmm. It's also believed

11:03.435 --> 11:06.708
- that they have healing powers.
- You know, as a kid,

11:06.827 --> 11:10.167
uh, I never needed an encyclopedia
when I was living with Cassie.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.339
Well, that sounds like my mom.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.784
She would always tell me
these amazing adventures

11:14.872 --> 11:17.849
she had planned. Her stories
inspired me to take up sailing.

11:18.224 --> 11:20.917
I can't believe
you've been around the world.

11:21.005 --> 11:23.348
Yeah. I circled the world
a few times

11:23.435 --> 11:25.722
working for Jonathan Gardner.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.630
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. I'm in charge

11:27.718 --> 11:29.932
- of his entire fleet.
- You're definitely not

11:30.020 --> 11:33.604
- that shy little kid anymore.
- How-How old

11:33.692 --> 11:35.651
were you guys
when you lived together?

11:35.739 --> 11:37.800
Uh, I got placed there
when I was 6.

11:37.888 --> 11:40.097
Yeah, when I went
to college, you were 10.

11:40.185 --> 11:42.419
When I came home,
you were gone.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.028
Foster kids
get moved around a lot.

11:45.718 --> 11:47.872
Yeah, it took me a long time
to find you again.

11:48.066 --> 11:50.207
And I know we may not have seen
each other as much as we wanted,

11:50.294 --> 11:52.403
but now that you're here,
we're gonna start

11:52.491 --> 11:55.091
making up for that.
I gotta go check in

11:55.206 --> 11:57.747
- with the office.
- OK.

12:12.341 --> 12:14.399
Dr. Katovitz is
covering for you,

12:14.637 --> 12:16.700
so what's really going on?

12:18.013 --> 12:21.372
Like, I know Vincent being
here means a lot to you...

12:21.622 --> 12:24.557
Hmm... But you think
he's gonna disappoint me?

12:24.645 --> 12:26.324
He has before.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.622
I just don't want to see you
get hurt again.

12:30.131 --> 12:32.114
And I love you for that.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.138
But I need you
to do something for me.

12:38.879 --> 12:40.763
Give Vincent a chance.

12:52.413 --> 12:53.731
Aaah...

12:53.819 --> 12:56.557
Hey, Mr. Langer.
How's the patient?

12:56.645 --> 13:00.227
Bored. There's like
two channels in this place.

13:00.419 --> 13:03.401
Well, would a hot coffee
and a maple-bacon donut

13:03.489 --> 13:05.145
- cheer you up?
- Ohhh...

13:05.232 --> 13:07.147
Aaah... You know,

13:07.234 --> 13:10.520
if I don't make it
through the operation, this is

13:10.622 --> 13:12.551
what I'm gonna miss most.

13:12.856 --> 13:15.239
Sure your wife
will be happy to hear that.

13:15.466 --> 13:17.505
She'll be happy
I saved her half.

13:17.592 --> 13:19.708
Are you related
to this troublemaker?

13:20.724 --> 13:22.682
Mr. Langer was
my first customer

13:22.770 --> 13:26.636
the day that I opened my bistro.
He's come in every day since

13:26.724 --> 13:29.427
for a hot coffee
and a maple-bacon donut.

13:29.974 --> 13:30.995
I came in to see

13:31.083 --> 13:33.464
if you want to play some gin,
but I can come back later.

13:33.552 --> 13:35.292
A doctor has time
to play cards?

13:35.380 --> 13:38.323
Haha! A doctor
probably doesn't,

13:38.411 --> 13:40.810
but a hospital chaplain does.

13:41.435 --> 13:42.581
Adam Hawkins.

13:42.669 --> 13:45.550
Oh! Uh, you don't look
like a chaplain.

13:45.638 --> 13:48.020
What does a chaplain
look like?

13:50.391 --> 13:52.466
We gonna play cards of what?

13:54.270 --> 13:57.379
I'll let you two get to it.

13:57.872 --> 13:59.270
It was nice to meet you.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.919
Yeah. You too.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.411
- Um, great song!
- That was my parents'

14:13.499 --> 14:15.864
first dance at their wedding.
I'm adding it

14:15.952 --> 14:17.652
- to the playlist for the band.
- I love it.

14:17.739 --> 14:19.202
I can't wait to meet them.

14:19.795 --> 14:21.926
Ten to one, as soon
as they get here, my dad will

14:22.014 --> 14:24.442
tell you how they made
record time from Minnesota.

14:24.724 --> 14:26.605
And then he'll start looking
for things to fix

14:26.693 --> 14:29.051
- around the house.
- Well, I was kind of hoping

14:29.139 --> 14:30.794
they'd be here by now.
I have a few things to do

14:30.881 --> 14:34.234
before Grace's final fitting
for her maid of honour gown.

14:34.639 --> 14:36.519
Actually, perfect timing.

14:36.607 --> 14:39.459
- Hello! We're here!
- Ah!

14:41.950 --> 14:43.193
Hey, guys!

14:43.310 --> 14:45.139
No. That's how
you greet us?

14:45.232 --> 14:46.989
You give your mother a hug!

14:50.490 --> 14:53.113
And you too,
you're family now.

14:53.201 --> 14:54.981
Unless of course
you're not Cassie in which case

14:55.068 --> 14:58.810
- I'll be hugging a stranger.
- You're safe. Hahaha!

14:59.006 --> 15:01.261
Are you sure you want
to marry this one?

15:01.349 --> 15:03.933
- He's a little grumpy, you know?
- Yeah, I'm working on that.

15:04.021 --> 15:06.527
Haha! It's so great
to finally meet you both.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.746
And as you can see,
they're a handful.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.160
Oh, so that's why you've been
keeping Cassie to yourself:

15:11.248 --> 15:12.855
you're afraid
we'll embarrass you, huh?

15:12.943 --> 15:15.101
I missed you guys.

15:15.246 --> 15:17.176
Well, we have
a beautiful room ready for you.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.685
- Want me to show 'em?
- Thanks.

15:18.773 --> 15:21.724
No. Is there anything at all I can
do to help with the wedding?

15:21.958 --> 15:24.404
Yes. You can relax
and enjoy yourselves.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.629
Oh, well, we're already off
to a good start.

15:26.717 --> 15:31.043
- Made record time from Minnesota.
- Mmhmm. Dad, let me help you

15:31.131 --> 15:32.981
- with those bags.
- They're perfectly balanced,

15:33.068 --> 15:35.246
don't touch 'em.
Just show the way.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.480
If you throw out your back,
don't say I didn't offer.

15:37.568 --> 15:39.068
I'm like an ox.

15:39.232 --> 15:41.217
And when I unpacked,

15:41.305 --> 15:44.351
there's a bent sprinkler head
out there I want to fix.

15:45.498 --> 15:47.051
My two boys.

15:47.139 --> 15:48.961
Some things never change.

15:49.131 --> 15:51.357
You have a wonderful family.

15:53.623 --> 15:56.006
We have a wonderful family.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.668
- Did you get it?
- Just came this morning.

16:04.771 --> 16:07.715
I swear the bride and groom look
exactly like Cassie and Sam.

16:07.803 --> 16:10.254
I wouldn't be so excited.
The topper's that cool; no one's

16:10.342 --> 16:12.560
- gonna look at your cake.
- I hadn't thought of that.

16:12.677 --> 16:14.418
Where is it?
I want to see!

16:14.506 --> 16:15.849
Be right back.

16:20.037 --> 16:21.951
What? I'm gonna pay for it.

16:22.092 --> 16:24.519
Yeah. Well,
in that case,

16:24.607 --> 16:26.498
will you pay
for mine too, please?

16:32.014 --> 16:34.178
Well, that definitely
doesn't look like Cassie.

16:34.485 --> 16:36.771
It was too close to the oven
when I baked the cookies.

16:36.951 --> 16:39.301
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, don't panic.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.527
I can fix it. I think.

16:42.888 --> 16:44.043
The delivery company

16:44.131 --> 16:45.800
says the flowers didn't make it
onto the truck.

16:45.887 --> 16:49.488
Have no fear! You're looking
at an expert in damage control.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.168
- I'll make some calls...
- Martha...

16:51.256 --> 16:52.793
- grease some palms.
- Martha...

16:52.881 --> 16:54.582
There'll be flowers here
tout de suite!

16:54.670 --> 16:57.324
Martha! I've got it.
The flowers will arrive

16:57.412 --> 16:59.442
in plenty of time for the wedding.
There's no damage,

16:59.529 --> 17:01.965
- just a little hiccup.
- I hope so.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.675
Oh. Well then, I'll just have
an espresso to go.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.769
Aren't you supposed to be

17:06.857 --> 17:08.880
helping Cassie at the Bell, Book
& Candle while she's getting

17:08.967 --> 17:11.394
- ready for the wedding?
- I was just on my way there.

17:11.482 --> 17:15.152
It's all part of finding
the updated moi.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.076
Let's call it Martha 2.0.

17:18.184 --> 17:19.240
Tataa!

17:20.045 --> 17:21.207
Oh!

17:21.295 --> 17:23.490
- She forgot her coffee.
- I'll take it.

17:26.098 --> 17:27.277
And if I find it,

17:27.365 --> 17:28.911
then that'll be
my wedding gift to Cassie.

17:28.998 --> 17:30.976
- Oh, she'll love that.
- A tree?

17:31.209 --> 17:33.196
The Forever Tree.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.675
It's a Merriwick thing.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.840
Reminds me of the time
that I drove three hours

17:37.928 --> 17:39.600
to surprise your mother
with a piece of pie

17:39.687 --> 17:43.126
from a bakery that she loved.
That stuff is exhausting.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.599
You look good
in a suit, pal.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.550
You know, I've worn one
every day since I got

17:48.638 --> 17:51.490
my business degree.
That didn't take long.

17:51.623 --> 17:53.230
Did Dad tell you
to bring up college?

17:53.318 --> 17:55.738
Actually no.
I just did the math.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.246
College comes
after high school.

17:57.334 --> 17:59.410
- Ha!
- One thing I've learned:

17:59.498 --> 18:02.498
you gotta trust your guts.
Not just with people.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.748
With everything.

18:03.835 --> 18:07.685
So if you don't feel
that college is in your DNA,

18:07.826 --> 18:09.275
find what is.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.795
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Yeah, "thanks, Grandpa."

18:13.883 --> 18:16.894
Hey, you used to love
my advice, especially

18:16.982 --> 18:18.956
- when it came to dating.
- Ha!

18:19.044 --> 18:21.792
What kind of dating advice
would you give him?

18:21.880 --> 18:25.035
Hmm...
What's her name?

18:25.965 --> 18:27.336
Lyndsay.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.261
I met her at the ranch where Dad
and Cassie are getting married.

18:30.349 --> 18:33.036
- Got tongue-tied, didn't you?
- Totally.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.562
But I think she's into me.

18:35.649 --> 18:38.544
The only way to know for sure
is to ask her out.

18:38.809 --> 18:40.604
Yeah, I... I don't know.

18:40.692 --> 18:43.177
Worse she can do
is say no.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.989
Only way to find out
is ask her on a date.

18:46.442 --> 18:48.488
That makes total sense.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.073
I literally just gave you
the same advice.

18:51.161 --> 18:54.103
Yeah, but it sounded better
coming from Grandpa.

18:59.544 --> 19:01.597
OK, eyes are closed!

19:01.685 --> 19:04.409
Are they actually closed?
No peeking.

19:04.497 --> 19:06.557
OK, I'm not peeking,
but hurry,

19:06.645 --> 19:08.862
I've been waiting months for you
to surprise me with this dress.

19:10.778 --> 19:12.424
Tadaa!

19:12.903 --> 19:14.123
Ohhh...

19:14.981 --> 19:17.300
Oh, Grace,

19:17.560 --> 19:19.761
it's beautiful!

19:19.849 --> 19:21.651
You're beautiful!

19:21.739 --> 19:24.829
- You promise you like it?
- I love it.

19:24.916 --> 19:27.286
- OK.
- Wow!

19:27.527 --> 19:30.573
Ohhh... You know, it's been
quite a journey getting here,

19:30.661 --> 19:33.167
but I know everything is gonna

19:33.255 --> 19:35.356
- be perfect.
- I want to see too!

19:35.583 --> 19:38.700
Ohhh! Grace, you look amazing!

19:38.833 --> 19:40.671
Alright,
enough about you guys.

19:40.758 --> 19:42.565
How do I look?

19:44.613 --> 19:46.661
You've got to be kidding me.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.839
Well, I guess you two have
more in common than you think.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.932
Yeah.
We have a problem.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.307
- One of us needs a new dress.
- Clearly. Which one?

19:55.395 --> 19:57.661
OK, well,
it is my mom's wedding.

19:57.824 --> 20:01.200
And you'll both look amazing
no matter what you wear.

20:01.599 --> 20:04.307
You're right.
I can compromise.

20:04.418 --> 20:07.981
So can I. I'll find a dress
that puts this one to shame.

20:08.527 --> 20:10.442
Honestly...

20:12.403 --> 20:14.942
A lot of things
keep going wrong.

20:15.044 --> 20:17.190
Don't you think
that it's kind of weird?

20:17.278 --> 20:20.189
No. Me having
the same taste as Stephanie?

20:20.355 --> 20:22.015
Now, that's weird.

20:29.403 --> 20:31.141
Remember this guy?

20:31.435 --> 20:34.518
Elvis the elephant.
You gave it to me the day we met.

20:34.606 --> 20:35.900
Yeah, I told you
he would always be there

20:35.987 --> 20:37.945
when you needed him.
Well, so are you.

20:38.301 --> 20:40.419
You know, I hated
when you left for college.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.745
Elvis was supposed
to keep you company.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.784
His stories weren't
as good as yours.

20:44.872 --> 20:46.802
Is that why you put him
in my suitcase?

20:46.988 --> 20:49.278
I just didn't want you
to forget me.

20:49.379 --> 20:52.997
I could never forget you.
And I'm so proud of you.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.792
That means a lot, Cassie.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.095
You were the only one
who ever believed in me.

20:57.478 --> 20:59.169
I'll never stop.

21:11.631 --> 21:13.380
Stop! Don't move!

21:13.669 --> 21:16.206
Stephanie, you're not
feeling well.

21:16.294 --> 21:18.229
You have a...

21:18.769 --> 21:20.814
- A horrible headache.
- I knew it!

21:21.058 --> 21:23.141
You see? Cassie Nightingale
isn't the only one

21:23.229 --> 21:25.558
- with "intuition."
- OK, well,

21:25.729 --> 21:27.446
Cassie creates
this amazing blend

21:27.534 --> 21:29.675
of aromatherapy oils
for pain.

21:29.909 --> 21:31.199
Do you think
you can make me that?

21:31.286 --> 21:32.870
Oh! Of course.

21:34.644 --> 21:36.612
Now, let's see.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.534
Oh, uh...

21:40.253 --> 21:41.462
Uh...

21:41.550 --> 21:43.175
Hahaha!

21:43.571 --> 21:46.714
Let's do this
the old-fashioned way, shall we?

21:51.292 --> 21:53.586
Martha's magic.

21:53.995 --> 21:55.995
Take two and call me
in the morning.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.487
- Any other problems I can solve?
- Uh, well,

21:59.722 --> 22:03.144
since you seem to know everybody
and everything about them,

22:03.526 --> 22:05.972
what could you tell me about
Adam, the hospital chaplain?

22:06.065 --> 22:09.995
Why? Are you inquiring
about his relationship status?

22:10.159 --> 22:12.257
- I might be.
- Well, I happen to know

22:12.344 --> 22:15.448
that he's quite single
and quite the catch.

22:15.636 --> 22:18.313
Oh, wait. You're not seriously
considering pursuing him,

22:18.401 --> 22:19.917
- are you?
- Why?

22:20.004 --> 22:23.165
Well, it would be like
wearing two different socks.

22:23.253 --> 22:26.282
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just afraid

22:26.370 --> 22:28.737
that you may be reaching
for the stars.

22:29.136 --> 22:30.550
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

22:30.638 --> 22:33.823
Ha! Well, we'll see
about that.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.205
Is it something I said?

22:37.348 --> 22:38.807
Oh!

22:46.222 --> 22:47.550
Hey!

22:48.511 --> 22:51.792
- Hey, Sam.
- Does anything look familiar?

22:54.763 --> 22:56.286
Hmm...

22:56.573 --> 22:59.266
I recognize that old church
steeple in the background.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.799
So if I can find that church,
I'll find the Forever Tree?

23:01.886 --> 23:04.118
Uh, you might.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.344
But you have
one problem, Doc:

23:06.516 --> 23:08.977
that church was torn down
about 60 years ago.

23:10.063 --> 23:11.920
I got two days, George.

23:12.008 --> 23:14.133
Can you at least point me
in the general area?

23:14.274 --> 23:17.592
A lot of that land
got cleared for new farms.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.844
I hate to break it to you,
but there's a...

23:20.032 --> 23:22.155
good chance that tree
got cleared with it.

23:23.907 --> 23:26.133
Well, if it's out there,
I'll find it.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.610
Good luck.

23:30.157 --> 23:32.264
You know,
I... I really appreciate

23:32.352 --> 23:34.054
all your hospitality,
especially when you got

23:34.141 --> 23:36.365
everything else going on.
Sam and I couldn't imagine

23:36.453 --> 23:38.250
you not being here.

23:40.094 --> 23:43.086
Oh, classical guitar.

23:43.211 --> 23:45.428
Yeah. A customer traded that.

23:45.516 --> 23:48.209
- Bring back some memories?
- Jonathan used to play

23:48.297 --> 23:50.477
our wedding song
on one just like this.

23:52.149 --> 23:53.880
Well, those were the days.

23:54.243 --> 23:57.032
Um, I bet there are
plenty more of those days.

23:58.972 --> 24:02.899
- Oh, my two favourite ladies!
- Oh, what a nice surprise!

24:03.977 --> 24:06.115
- Aw, so sweet!
- Thank you.

24:06.203 --> 24:09.819
- Someone raised you right.
- Yes, someone did.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.436
Could I give you both

24:12.524 --> 24:14.967
- one little piece of advice?
- Yeah.

24:15.055 --> 24:17.209
- Of course.
- Never stop doing

24:17.297 --> 24:18.500
the little things.

24:20.227 --> 24:21.813
Well...

24:22.999 --> 24:24.750
I'm gonna go do some shopping.

24:35.922 --> 24:38.125
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:38.453 --> 24:41.530
- Still a man of few words.
- Well, actually I was...

24:41.618 --> 24:44.749
Easy, girl.
I think she likes you.

24:46.593 --> 24:47.882
Cool.

24:48.398 --> 24:49.921
Did you want to try?

24:51.075 --> 24:52.703
Sure.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.188
Wait. You have to go
in circular motions.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.599
Yeah, perfect.

25:00.906 --> 25:02.426
You really know
what you're doing.

25:02.514 --> 25:04.734
Well, I better.
I'm gonna be a veterinarian

25:04.875 --> 25:07.040
specializing in zoology
and surgery.

25:07.127 --> 25:08.969
- Wow!
- Yeah, I just applied

25:09.057 --> 25:11.329
for early decision at Cornell.
It's the top veterinary school

25:11.416 --> 25:13.655
in the country.
Sounds like you have

25:13.743 --> 25:16.289
- your whole future planned out.
- Don't you?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.094
Yeah.

25:18.414 --> 25:20.858
Of course. It's really important
to know what you want.

25:20.946 --> 25:23.907
I'm waiting to hear too.
Oh, from what school?

25:24.124 --> 25:26.139
I don't really want
to jinx it.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.842
Sorry, it's stressful enough.

25:27.930 --> 25:31.196
Definitely. Oh, did you want
to ask me something?

25:31.413 --> 25:32.935
Uh, nah, I'm... I'm good.

25:33.023 --> 25:36.303
Um, could you show me
the circle thing again?

25:36.391 --> 25:38.115
Yeah.

25:38.984 --> 25:41.000
You have to press pretty hard.
OK.

25:43.740 --> 25:46.336
Guess what I have!

25:46.578 --> 25:48.218
Oh, the mock-up bouquet?

25:48.306 --> 25:50.927
I totally outdid myself,
which is impressive

25:51.015 --> 25:53.671
considering I am juggling
my shop and running this town.

25:55.140 --> 25:58.523
Ohhh... it's beautiful!

25:59.132 --> 26:01.913
Mmm! And I appreciate
all your hard work.

26:02.304 --> 26:04.302
Since I took
such good care of you,

26:04.390 --> 26:06.421
I need you to do
one thing for me.

26:06.509 --> 26:08.122
Make sure you're the one
to catch it?

26:08.210 --> 26:09.911
I'll be staying
in the back on the right.

26:09.999 --> 26:12.304
OK. If you do catch it,

26:12.460 --> 26:14.450
is there a lucky guy in mind?

26:14.538 --> 26:17.812
Sadly, the man of my dreams
is only in my dreams.

26:18.156 --> 26:20.810
Or maybe right
outside your door.

26:21.859 --> 26:23.682
Yeah, right.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.511
I gotta get these
back to the shop.

26:26.598 --> 26:29.993
- I'll see you at home.
- Mmhmm.

26:37.795 --> 26:41.146
Excuse me!

26:41.352 --> 26:43.156
Hello?

26:45.984 --> 26:47.450
What do you think
you're doing?

26:47.538 --> 26:49.374
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

26:49.531 --> 26:52.109
I was just picking up
a newspaper.

26:52.312 --> 26:54.411
I like to keep up
on what's going on in town.

26:54.499 --> 26:57.029
Actually, you're disturbing
the town. Not to mention

26:57.117 --> 26:59.152
- you're parked illegally.
- Didn't realize.

26:59.764 --> 27:01.208
I should write you a ticket.

27:01.326 --> 27:04.492
- Are you a police officer?
- I'm the mayor.

27:05.835 --> 27:08.187
Mayor of Blairsville
never complains.

27:08.421 --> 27:11.828
You're in Middleton now or
did you not realize that either?

27:18.062 --> 27:19.542
Hey!

27:46.591 --> 27:49.499
OK.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.701
Hey there.

28:10.132 --> 28:13.421
- Everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

28:13.509 --> 28:15.179
Of course.

28:15.648 --> 28:19.609
- Oh! Don't look.
- Oh! OK, I'm not looking.

28:37.359 --> 28:38.882
That screw looks
pretty stripped.

28:38.969 --> 28:41.085
Wanna use the needle-nose
pliers and yank it out?

28:41.173 --> 28:43.203
No, it'll split the wood.

28:43.383 --> 28:45.693
I was gonna tackle
that door next week.

28:45.781 --> 28:48.404
Oh, well, uh, I hope
you don't mind my jumping in.

28:48.492 --> 28:51.554
Anything else on my list
you'd like to do, help yourself.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.604
- Hahaha!
- I'll be in my hammock.

28:54.835 --> 28:56.302
Hello, boys!

28:56.428 --> 28:58.538
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, sweetie.

28:58.648 --> 28:59.789
You want me to help you
with those bags?

28:59.876 --> 29:02.726
No. I've got surprises in here
and if you see them,

29:02.814 --> 29:04.726
then they won't be surprises.

29:06.460 --> 29:09.109
I bet your father broke that
just so he could fix it.

29:09.304 --> 29:11.871
Hahaha! I know how he operates.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.843
If you two are done,

29:14.026 --> 29:16.695
could you hand me
a flathead screwdriver?

29:17.249 --> 29:19.151
Well, I'll let
you two bond.

29:23.811 --> 29:26.068
- You two having a fight?
- Not that I'm aware of.

29:26.156 --> 29:29.132
- You hardly looked at her.
- I know what she looks like.

29:29.359 --> 29:30.857
Could I have that flathead?

29:32.134 --> 29:34.091
Thank you.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.281
Your mom seems happy.

29:39.781 --> 29:43.218
Yeah, she is.
I'm really glad that she found Sam.

29:46.871 --> 29:48.734
But you miss
your dad, don't you?

29:50.861 --> 29:54.237
- Did you know my dad?
- I only met him once,

29:54.325 --> 29:56.457
but he's the kind of guy
you never forget.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.156
You know, I lost my parents
when I was young,

30:01.243 --> 30:05.234
so I get how you feel.
It's not easy.

30:05.952 --> 30:09.114
Can you believe that
one of our esteemed citizens

30:09.201 --> 30:11.851
just asked me to dedicate
a statue to their parakeet?

30:11.939 --> 30:14.560
- It is a noble bird.
- I'm guessing

30:14.648 --> 30:16.264
you're the Vincent
I've heard so much about.

30:16.351 --> 30:18.341
- Guilty.
- Well, she is the mayor,

30:18.428 --> 30:22.202
- she can pardon you.
- Hmm, not sure he deserves it.

30:23.130 --> 30:25.380
Would you mind stopping by
the shop later to help me with

30:25.468 --> 30:27.593
- the rest of the wedding flowers?
- I will be there.

30:27.759 --> 30:28.970
Nice to meet you, Vincent.

30:37.559 --> 30:40.012
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Adam!

30:40.309 --> 30:43.309
- Hey.
- This place is great!

30:43.397 --> 30:46.426
Well, thanks for saying that.
I work really hard at it.

30:46.786 --> 30:48.816
"Nothing worth having
comes easy," right?

30:48.972 --> 30:51.074
Theodore Roosevelt.

30:51.653 --> 30:52.926
I'm impressed.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.682
Now that I've impressed you,
what can I get for you?

30:55.909 --> 30:57.857
12 cups of OJ, please.

30:58.488 --> 31:00.332
You really like juice, huh?

31:01.043 --> 31:03.386
Not as much as the kids
in my baseball team.

31:03.598 --> 31:06.528
- You're a coach?!
- I try, yes.

31:06.654 --> 31:09.067
Well, I am sure
they learn a lot from you.

31:09.691 --> 31:11.975
I learn a lot
from them too.

31:14.843 --> 31:16.324
You OK?

31:16.699 --> 31:19.817
Yeah. I just love baseball.

31:20.363 --> 31:22.056
- Do you have a favourite team?
- Uh-huh.

31:22.143 --> 31:24.059
It's, um...

31:25.008 --> 31:27.706
- What's your favourite team?
- Diehard Cubs.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.426
Me too! Cubs

31:29.529 --> 31:32.137
diehard... Ohhh! Wow!

31:32.632 --> 31:34.168
I'm such a klutz.

31:34.256 --> 31:36.823
- Hahaha!
- Maybe we are mismatched socks.

31:36.911 --> 31:38.434
I'm sorry.

31:39.072 --> 31:42.380
No, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go get you that juice.

31:42.996 --> 31:44.285
Thanks.

31:44.415 --> 31:47.074
- It's pretty hot out there.
- In here too.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.043
Four years later,
and I finally like drinking tea.

31:52.130 --> 31:55.177
- No, you don't!
- No.

31:55.264 --> 31:56.746
I really don't.

31:56.834 --> 31:59.215
But I love you
for doing it for me.

31:59.311 --> 32:01.387
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

32:01.475 --> 32:03.918
You keep talking like that,
and I might have to marry you.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.274
How's tomorrow?

32:05.361 --> 32:07.885
Um, I happen to have some time
on my schedule.

32:09.897 --> 32:11.942
Hi, George.

32:12.302 --> 32:14.301
Oh! You seem
to be on a mission.

32:14.583 --> 32:17.090
Uh, no, I just want
to have a word with Sam.

32:17.178 --> 32:20.559
Oh, well, your timing is perfect,
I was just heading out.

32:26.686 --> 32:28.199
Look what I have.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.502
It's a Middleton map.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.389
It must be
at least a hundred years old.

32:33.476 --> 32:35.676
- Yeah, it looks it.
- See...

32:35.982 --> 32:38.692
- this little thing right here?
- Barely.

32:38.780 --> 32:42.262
That's the old church.
The tree seems to be somewhere

32:42.350 --> 32:44.967
in Foster's Wood.
So you pinpoint the church,

32:45.055 --> 32:47.334
you're gonna be darn close
to the tree.

32:50.811 --> 32:52.726
Looks like that's
from the 1800s.

32:52.828 --> 32:55.803
- I guess you know your maps.
- Yeah. You can see

32:55.917 --> 32:57.877
from the borderlines,
the colours, even the creases

32:57.964 --> 33:00.467
in the paper.
I used one to sail

33:00.555 --> 33:02.988
a Saudi prince's yacht
to an ancient port.

33:03.076 --> 33:06.318
Uh, we're trying
to find the Forever Tree.

33:07.239 --> 33:09.465
There's Merriwick family lore

33:09.553 --> 33:11.803
that goes with it.
I wanted to surprise Cassie.

33:11.943 --> 33:14.006
I'd love to help.
Why don't I come with you.

33:16.091 --> 33:18.180
That... sounds great.

33:31.256 --> 33:33.022
What inspired all this?!

33:33.112 --> 33:35.999
I'm trying to figure
how early decision works.

33:36.101 --> 33:39.460
The early ship has sailed.
At this point, you are late.

33:39.604 --> 33:41.258
How late?

33:41.587 --> 33:44.285
Only by like...
five months.

33:45.930 --> 33:49.374
- Well, that's a problem.
- Why?

33:51.680 --> 33:55.161
I kind of told a girl
that I met at the ranch

33:55.249 --> 33:57.037
that I applied.

33:57.726 --> 33:59.351
Why?

33:59.568 --> 34:01.591
Because I was trying
to impress her.

34:01.679 --> 34:04.468
By lying...
That is not exactly impressive.

34:04.657 --> 34:06.623
And that's not
exactly helpful.

34:07.873 --> 34:09.108
You want my help?

34:10.540 --> 34:12.134
Try being honest.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.032
As far as I could tell,

34:16.120 --> 34:18.587
we should head
a little further south.

34:20.030 --> 34:21.556
Yeah, yeah,
that's definitely it.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.601
The tree's out there.
It's this way.

34:23.870 --> 34:25.188
Looks like
you're enjoying this.

34:25.277 --> 34:28.540
I love it, man. It's like
when I chart a destination

34:28.650 --> 34:30.070
and head out
on the high seas.

34:30.157 --> 34:31.931
It's just me versus nature.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.110
- I guess it's hard to explain.
- I think you explained it

34:35.206 --> 34:37.993
- pretty well.
- You ever feel that way?

34:38.132 --> 34:40.701
I do, yeah.
Right before surgery.

34:41.259 --> 34:44.469
Set a goal, conquer it.
Cassie taught me that.

34:44.735 --> 34:46.813
I doubt Cassie used
the word "conquer."

34:46.902 --> 34:49.253
Hahaha! That's not really
in her vocabulary,

34:49.341 --> 34:51.993
but she always talked about
never letting your situation

34:52.081 --> 34:53.712
get in the way
of your goals.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.929
She'd say,
"If you follow your heart,

34:57.016 --> 35:00.032
- you'll be successful in life."
- Now, that sounds like Cassie.

35:00.286 --> 35:03.017
I was a handful as a kid.
She was the first person

35:03.105 --> 35:05.134
who made me feel like...

35:05.992 --> 35:07.689
things might be OK.

35:08.978 --> 35:10.782
Why did you stay
away so long?

35:12.344 --> 35:13.790
I wanted to see her,

35:13.878 --> 35:16.532
but I was trying to make
something of myself first.

35:17.501 --> 35:19.351
You know,
for a long time, I was

35:19.439 --> 35:21.939
stepping up to the plate
and only hitting singles.

35:22.505 --> 35:25.090
I wanted Cassie to see a guy
who was blasting homeruns.

35:25.434 --> 35:28.285
- Guessing you played some ball.
- Second base.

35:28.465 --> 35:31.114
And when I'm not on a boat,
it's where I feel most at home.

35:33.045 --> 35:35.047
Starting to think
I misjudged you.

35:35.887 --> 35:38.825
Yeah, I had a feeling
you didn't like me very much.

35:39.855 --> 35:42.262
Well, tell you what,

35:42.550 --> 35:45.559
you help me find this tree,
you'll have a friend for life.

35:45.785 --> 35:48.975
Does effort count?
As far as I could tell,

35:49.153 --> 35:51.184
it's one of these needles
in a haystack.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.720
Well, let's start looking
for carved initials.

35:59.751 --> 36:02.246
- Ooh, comfort food!
- Mmm!

36:02.372 --> 36:04.621
Mayor Pershing.

36:05.668 --> 36:07.559
Just leave it
on my desk.

36:07.714 --> 36:09.778
Thanks for calling. Bye.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.827
Kid just wants me
to fix his parking ticket.

36:12.915 --> 36:15.091
I get calls like that
all day long.

36:15.179 --> 36:18.012
- I could get you a slice.
- No, it's OK, I'll just eat

36:18.100 --> 36:20.582
yours. Also, I'm taking
Martha for me today

36:20.670 --> 36:22.973
if that's OK. She's helping me
at the flower shop.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.262
This mayor thing
is out of control.

36:25.364 --> 36:27.785
I'm fine with that,
but how does Martha feel?

36:27.973 --> 36:30.160
She wants me to get her house
moved back to Middleton

36:30.248 --> 36:32.895
- so she can be mayor again.
- What do you want? It sounds

36:32.983 --> 36:35.619
- like you're ready to resign.
- I'm so ready,

36:35.707 --> 36:38.403
but I'm not ready to give
Martha the satisfaction.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.168
I better go put

36:41.256 --> 36:43.184
the finishing touches
on the wedding flowers.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.183
Mayor Pershing.

36:45.499 --> 36:48.338
- Hey, where have you two been?
- Out looking

36:48.426 --> 36:52.212
- for buried treasure.
- In Middleton? Together?

36:52.371 --> 36:55.957
- It's a town full of surprises.
- I think it's great.

36:56.879 --> 36:58.348
It had its moments.

37:00.023 --> 37:01.848
I'm gonna go take a shower.

37:03.060 --> 37:05.062
Sound like you two
found common ground.

37:05.150 --> 37:06.935
Yeah, I guess he couldn't
resist my charm.

37:07.023 --> 37:09.293
- Well, who could?
- Haha!

37:09.607 --> 37:12.129
You know, being here
with you...

37:13.559 --> 37:14.934
feels like home.

37:17.105 --> 37:19.527
It's a home
you're always welcome in.

37:20.723 --> 37:23.168
In that case, maybe I'll stick
around a while.

37:29.574 --> 37:31.418
So you see, Henry,
if you use

37:31.506 --> 37:33.514
the right turn of phrase
to say, "Get well,"

37:33.602 --> 37:35.656
you don't even need a bouquet.

37:36.793 --> 37:38.535
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.144
You haven't sold

37:42.232 --> 37:44.364
a single flower today,
have you?

37:44.487 --> 37:47.129
Now that you mention it,
it has been rather slow.

37:47.285 --> 37:49.605
But that hasn't stopped me
from doling out advice.

37:49.693 --> 37:53.348
My wisdom simply cannot
be contained behind a register.

37:53.699 --> 37:55.884
Let me guess,
you and your wisdom

37:55.972 --> 37:57.777
would prefer to be in city hall?

37:57.923 --> 38:01.785
You know, in my search
for Martha 2.0,

38:02.082 --> 38:03.410
I have come
to the conclusion

38:03.498 --> 38:05.230
that the Martha
that I like best

38:05.318 --> 38:08.331
is, well, Mayor Martha.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.733
Mayor Pershing.

38:16.370 --> 38:18.590
No! I'm sorry,
I can't help you!

38:18.852 --> 38:22.137
- What was that?
- The last straw.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.119
Tell me you're not
putting these pictures out

38:27.206 --> 38:29.199
- where anyone can see them.
- Throwback photos

38:29.287 --> 38:31.377
- are a tradition at weddings.
- Our guests will love that.

38:31.464 --> 38:34.206
- The groom won't.
- The room was an adorable kid.

38:34.294 --> 38:36.894
No, the bride was
an adorable kid.

38:37.651 --> 38:40.119
- I guess I was pretty cute too.
- Do I have a say in that?

38:40.207 --> 38:41.974
Uh, only if you say
something nice.

38:42.061 --> 38:45.761
- Haha! Pass.
- Really glad you're here, Dad.

38:47.214 --> 38:49.512
- What did he do this time?
- Refused to admit

38:49.600 --> 38:51.574
- that I was a cute kid.
- Haha!

38:51.662 --> 38:54.574
Uh, do you have any newspaper
I can put under this paint?

38:54.668 --> 38:57.381
Uh, in the recycling bin
outside the door.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.027
Ah, OK.

38:59.948 --> 39:01.864
Jennifer, you should try
some of my buttercream cupcakes.

39:01.951 --> 39:05.721
- They're on the counter.
- That sounds good, thank you.

39:07.842 --> 39:09.800
Mmm!

39:13.962 --> 39:17.139
It's the annual flight
of the fireflies.

39:17.332 --> 39:19.055
Come on, I was reading that.

39:19.142 --> 39:21.100
I'm trying to paint here.

39:21.187 --> 39:24.082
Every year, thousands of
fireflies return to a clearing

39:24.170 --> 39:26.457
in Foster's Wood, and
they light up at the same time.

39:26.545 --> 39:30.605
- It's really amazing to watch.
- I would love to see that.

39:30.870 --> 39:33.418
And I'm sure
Dad would love to take you.

39:33.730 --> 39:36.066
But we never do things
like this anymore.

39:37.099 --> 39:39.276
OK. You wanna

39:39.503 --> 39:42.353
see some bugs that light up?
We'll go see some bugs.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.387
- It's a date.
- Alright.

39:45.475 --> 39:47.806
You know, I'm really glad
you needed this newspaper;

39:47.894 --> 39:49.519
otherwise, I never
would have seen this.

39:49.672 --> 39:52.402
- Yeah.
- That was lucky.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.504
Hey, you. If I'd known
you were coming,

40:06.592 --> 40:08.269
I would have worn
my good boots.

40:10.005 --> 40:11.144
I've been trying to connect

40:11.232 --> 40:13.536
with that horse. I feel like
he wants to tell me something,

40:13.623 --> 40:17.184
- but I just don't know what.
- I know how he feels.

40:17.355 --> 40:19.762
- Sorry, what?
- Nothing.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.965
Actually, I was hoping
we could talk.

40:23.066 --> 40:25.774
Maybe later tonight,
we can get dessert.

40:26.012 --> 40:28.124
How about a round
of Destination over ice cream?

40:28.211 --> 40:30.121
Great! We can go
to the Bistro,

40:30.209 --> 40:33.168
- and they have great Wi-Fi, so...
- Bring your Ghost Armor,

40:33.279 --> 40:36.225
you're gonna need it.
I'm just gonna go put her away.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.269
Come on.

40:41.066 --> 40:42.824
We have a contract!

40:43.835 --> 40:46.969
John, we go back a lot of years,
don't do this.

40:48.864 --> 40:52.277
Fine. I'll leave the keys
with the harbourmaster.

40:52.888 --> 40:55.355
Hey. Is everything OK?

40:55.838 --> 40:57.300
Great.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.347
Just need a little air.

41:07.054 --> 41:09.066
Mayor Davenport,
I'm Mayor Pershing.

41:09.154 --> 41:11.765
Absolutely. I love cats.

41:12.376 --> 41:13.911
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:16.153 --> 41:17.955
Actually, I'm more
of a dog person,

41:18.043 --> 41:20.325
but you gotta keep
the constituents happy.

41:20.513 --> 41:23.614
- You're the mayor.
- Donovan Davenport.

41:23.701 --> 41:26.161
It's a pleasure
to officially meet you.

41:27.312 --> 41:29.769
Did you come to give me that
ticket for disturbing the peace?

41:29.857 --> 41:32.231
Wow, you think
you're really charming, don't you?

41:32.318 --> 41:33.397
Doesn't matter what I think;

41:33.484 --> 41:36.693
- it's all about the voters.
- I vote no.

41:36.888 --> 41:38.847
Well, lucky for me
you don't live in Blairsville.

41:39.192 --> 41:42.130
Unlucky for you,
Martha Tinsdale does.

41:42.223 --> 41:44.864
- What can I do for you?
- You can agree to a deal

41:44.952 --> 41:46.420
to return the town line
to where it was,

41:46.507 --> 41:48.763
so that Martha can become
a citizen of Middleton again.

41:49.130 --> 41:50.946
And what's in it for me?

41:51.227 --> 41:53.140
Or should I say Blairsville?

41:53.228 --> 41:55.447
Goodwill between our towns.

41:56.603 --> 41:59.033
- What do you want?
- Actually, I want to keep

41:59.121 --> 42:00.431
things the way they are.

42:00.730 --> 42:03.953
Martha's a formidable political
opponent; why would I want

42:04.041 --> 42:05.768
to make it possible for her
to return office?

42:05.855 --> 42:08.259
And I'm not
a formidable opponent?

42:08.422 --> 42:11.429
You said it, not me.
Now if you don't mind,

42:11.517 --> 42:13.244
I have work to do.

42:15.556 --> 42:17.798
It would appear so do I.

42:26.055 --> 42:28.523
You open it!
No. I'll open it!

42:28.611 --> 42:30.744
It's the same dress
as it was in the last fitting.

42:30.832 --> 42:33.041
I know, but three weeks ago,
we didn't have the shoes,

42:33.129 --> 42:36.156
jewelry, veil. I am finally
going to be able to see you

42:36.244 --> 42:38.203
as a complete bride.

42:39.314 --> 42:40.909
What is it?

42:41.705 --> 42:43.275
It's probably nothing.

42:43.619 --> 42:46.564
You don't get that look
over nothing.

42:54.118 --> 42:56.587
Oh no!
What's wrong?

42:56.829 --> 42:58.189
It's been eaten by moths.

43:03.975 --> 43:05.458
It's ruined.
