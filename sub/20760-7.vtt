00:00.484 --> 00:02.132
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...

00:02.157 --> 00:03.695
Ramse is dead

00:03.719 --> 00:06.078
and you did not fire up the
machine to go and save him.

00:07.127 --> 00:09.250
Jones is gonna want you
to tell her everything.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.687
- Don't.
- Our son...

00:10.712 --> 00:12.078
I wanted to name him Ethan.

00:12.103 --> 00:14.320
The mother is not the
belly that bares the child,

00:14.345 --> 00:15.828
but the hands that cradle.

00:15.853 --> 00:18.414
- Mind yourself.
- Tick, tock, return to Titan.

00:18.439 --> 00:19.531
He's Primary.

00:21.876 --> 00:23.172
Get down low!

00:24.533 --> 00:26.140
We'll come back, armed and ready.

00:26.165 --> 00:27.796
Stop it once and for all.

00:27.821 --> 00:30.460
I know what we're supposed
to do, but I can't.

00:30.485 --> 00:31.953
I can.

00:39.329 --> 00:43.645
I don't know who of
you believes in a god.

00:43.648 --> 00:47.927
And if so, what kind?

00:47.963 --> 00:51.692
A god of absolutes.

00:51.723 --> 00:54.033
Or a god of compromise.

00:54.069 --> 00:59.405
My god of late has been time.

00:59.441 --> 01:03.943
Time doesn't concern itself
with morality or good or evil,

01:03.979 --> 01:08.337
but with if and when.

01:10.585 --> 01:13.052
A god who understands
that I've already done

01:13.088 --> 01:16.553
that which I will one day do.

01:18.718 --> 01:22.628
Our sins precede us.

01:22.664 --> 01:24.897
They define us.

01:24.933 --> 01:29.368
One hopes, in the name
of order and necessity,

01:29.404 --> 01:32.805
wrong for the sake of right.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.261
We are faced now with an opportunity.

01:43.639 --> 01:46.682
The Witness, in his earliest days.

01:49.059 --> 01:51.444
But let's not soften the truth.

01:54.565 --> 01:56.498
We are going to kill a child.

02:00.602 --> 02:04.336
A boy of unknown origin.

02:04.372 --> 02:06.472
A man with a certain future.

02:09.544 --> 02:13.179
Both the architect of our destruction.

02:17.152 --> 02:19.351
We must not delude ourselves

02:19.387 --> 02:21.754
with a notion of innocence.

02:25.694 --> 02:28.061
The boy is the man.

02:29.698 --> 02:31.497
A totality of moments.

02:34.803 --> 02:39.805
And we have ended, once
again, where we began.

02:39.841 --> 02:41.907
One life

02:41.943 --> 02:45.878
in exchange for seven billion.

02:45.914 --> 02:48.714
We don't just have an opportunity.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.829
We have an obligation.

02:53.282 --> 02:55.815
The bullet doesn't kill in one second.

02:56.335 --> 02:59.161
It kills in every second.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.549
We're just placing it then
where we need it to be now.

03:07.769 --> 03:10.269
One more thing,

03:10.305 --> 03:13.740
no god shall forgive us this sin.

03:16.645 --> 03:20.980
Perhaps none should.

03:21.016 --> 03:26.052
For that, all we have is each other.

03:30.759 --> 03:35.061
And the great absolution of time...

03:37.065 --> 03:40.833
that we might have never sinned at all.

04:01.856 --> 04:05.157
- Voila!
- Voila is usually proposed

04:05.193 --> 04:07.826
to express satisfaction or approval.

04:07.862 --> 04:09.929
I'm not getting either
from that piece of shit.

04:09.965 --> 04:12.731
That piece of shit is how
we are going to disable

04:12.767 --> 04:14.800
the Guardians' unique advantage.

04:14.836 --> 04:17.999
Think of it as a modified EMP device,

04:18.053 --> 04:20.063
which will dampen all electronics

04:20.084 --> 04:22.045
and generate a burst of interference.

04:22.091 --> 04:24.923
To which even these
suits will be susceptible.

04:24.961 --> 04:26.982
So what does that get us?

04:27.021 --> 04:30.797
A window. A very narrow window. Hannah?

04:30.843 --> 04:32.751
We'll splinter to 1953,

04:32.787 --> 04:34.720
to the exact moment James and Cassandra

04:34.756 --> 04:36.722
located the Witness's safe house.

04:36.758 --> 04:38.924
We'll detonate, then we'll engage.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.027
Smoke the little bastard.

04:42.063 --> 04:44.763
There's a lot riding on this.

04:44.799 --> 04:46.765
Sure that thing's gonna work?

04:46.801 --> 04:49.835
The suits come equipped
with a control unit.

04:49.871 --> 04:51.737
I've set it to splinter

04:51.773 --> 04:54.106
approximately two
seconds into the future.

04:59.681 --> 05:00.813
Dr. Lasky?

05:07.122 --> 05:09.655
Wasn't me.

05:09.691 --> 05:11.958
And again...

05:14.829 --> 05:16.862
it's now disabled.

05:16.898 --> 05:18.865
Thank you, Dr. Lasky.

05:21.008 --> 05:22.173
A warning, however:

05:22.209 --> 05:23.375
These suits come with

05:23.411 --> 05:26.144
all kinds of dangerous functions.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.545
Here.

05:27.581 --> 05:31.082
Individual suits can synchronize.

05:31.118 --> 05:34.619
And this is a self-destruct mechanism.

05:34.655 --> 05:37.289
Either for the purpose
of avoiding capture

05:37.325 --> 05:39.291
or to eliminate remainders.

05:39.327 --> 05:41.894
- Remainders?
- Their doubles.

05:43.998 --> 05:46.031
That's why the EMP is key.

05:48.469 --> 05:50.002
I can't go.

05:55.910 --> 05:58.877
My mother died of an embolism.

05:58.913 --> 06:02.247
I was at school and I saw my father

06:02.283 --> 06:05.383
walk into the classroom.

06:05.419 --> 06:08.420
And I knew.

06:08.456 --> 06:10.922
His eyes.

06:12.526 --> 06:15.126
And the last time I saw her,

06:15.162 --> 06:17.996
she asked me to go somewhere with her.

06:18.032 --> 06:19.164
A museum.

06:23.070 --> 06:24.503
And I said no.

06:26.574 --> 06:30.208
She had this look.

06:30.244 --> 06:34.246
I think somehow she knew that she was...

06:38.185 --> 06:41.353
That was our last moment together.

06:41.389 --> 06:42.788
I'm sorry.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.327
I don't know who our son is.

06:49.363 --> 06:51.063
Or why...

06:56.470 --> 07:00.071
I just know that I
can't have someone that

07:00.107 --> 07:03.441
I should've loved

07:03.477 --> 07:05.244
ever look at me like that again.

07:07.481 --> 07:12.183
Even if afterwards it
will never have happened...

07:14.522 --> 07:16.455
somehow for me, I'll still know.

07:25.099 --> 07:30.301
The only time we've
ever made a difference...

07:30.337 --> 07:33.371
Made anything better...

07:33.407 --> 07:35.348
Is because we've gone in together.

07:38.879 --> 07:40.078
Will it be better?

07:41.916 --> 07:44.048
We...

07:44.084 --> 07:47.285
kill the Witness, reset time.

07:47.321 --> 07:50.855
There is no you and me.

07:50.891 --> 07:53.125
No us and him.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.430
We don't get to change the
past and keep the future.

08:26.227 --> 08:28.359
Didn't you have a dog?

08:28.395 --> 08:30.895
He comes and goes.

08:30.931 --> 08:33.498
Never pegged you for a drinker.

08:33.534 --> 08:36.601
Each monumental task deserves a toast.

08:36.636 --> 08:37.970
May I?

08:40.374 --> 08:42.340
Couple of years ago,
when I was struggling

08:42.376 --> 08:44.309
to perfect that damn machine,

08:44.345 --> 08:47.512
and I was facing failure after failure,

08:47.548 --> 08:49.448
I turned to the Nobel physicist,

08:49.504 --> 08:51.737
Dr. Jameson, for inspiration.

08:51.773 --> 08:54.106
- Yeah.
- That hangover...

08:54.142 --> 08:55.908
Headaches, hallucinations...

08:59.648 --> 09:04.516
Hallucinations.

09:04.552 --> 09:08.487
But I awoke with a solution.

09:08.523 --> 09:10.656
Sometimes the only way
to know what's left in us

09:10.692 --> 09:12.616
is to see what's at the bottom.

09:15.997 --> 09:19.365
Well, Cassie's out.

09:19.401 --> 09:22.267
Cole's been unusually quiet.

09:22.303 --> 09:25.037
They seem a little off to you?

09:25.073 --> 09:27.973
This is a very difficult mission to ask.

09:28.009 --> 09:30.209
Especially for a doctor.

09:30.245 --> 09:32.544
But those two...

09:32.580 --> 09:35.948
Even when they're not
talking, they speak volumes.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.749
They won't even look at each other.

09:41.222 --> 09:45.391
Listen, Deacon, Cassie
spent months in captivity.

09:45.427 --> 09:46.592
Yeah, I know.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.594
And Mr. Cole just lost his best friend.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.097
He did. He lost his brother.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.734
And kudos to him for not
jumping in the Wayback Machine

09:55.770 --> 09:58.504
to save him.

09:58.540 --> 10:03.242
And Cassie, she led us to
Titan and they were just

10:03.278 --> 10:07.546
waiting for her to lock her up.

10:07.582 --> 10:09.481
What are you saying?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.686
You wanna pull people together,

10:13.722 --> 10:16.255
you put them through hell.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.323
You wanna split people apart,

10:18.359 --> 10:19.992
give 'em a secret.

10:23.064 --> 10:25.098
- Mr. Deacon...
- I'll be there.

10:29.270 --> 10:33.272
We cannot risk splintering
this device with that machine.

10:33.308 --> 10:35.708
The effects could be disastrous.

10:35.744 --> 10:39.178
However, this version was
replicated from the prototype

10:39.214 --> 10:42.281
- which existed already in 1953.
- Where?

10:42.317 --> 10:43.889
Right here, where we're standing.

10:43.892 --> 10:46.719
Raritan National Laboratories.

10:46.755 --> 10:49.755
You'll splinter in four hours
before the guardians arrive

10:49.791 --> 10:52.691
with the Witness to steal the prototype.

10:52.727 --> 10:55.694
I want to go.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.363
What? I have lab experience.

10:58.399 --> 10:59.631
I can talk the talk.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.433
I should go.

11:01.469 --> 11:03.435
Very well.

11:03.471 --> 11:07.973
So you and Mr. Cole
will retrieve the EMP.

11:08.009 --> 11:11.744
Mr. Whitley and Mr. Deacon,
you'll provide egress.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.537
Hannah, you'll secure the entry point

11:13.568 --> 11:15.023
beyond the Guardians' safe house.

11:20.463 --> 11:22.896
You'll rendezvous there,

11:22.932 --> 11:27.434
and then you'll eliminate the target.

11:40.531 --> 11:42.929
Initiate splinter sequence.

12:12.248 --> 12:15.282
Raritan National Laboratory
sure gets real handsy.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.485
Yeah, looks like they
open it up to local talent.

12:18.521 --> 12:20.721
- Ew.
- Look, it's perfect.

12:20.757 --> 12:23.524
All you gotta do is cozy
up to one of these eggheads,

12:23.560 --> 12:25.225
get him to let us
into the magnetics lab.

12:25.261 --> 12:26.527
You cozy up.

12:26.563 --> 12:29.363
Look, the lab is gonna be locked.

12:29.399 --> 12:31.965
We need someone to let us in. Okay?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.701
Pretend you're interested.
Just act natural.

12:34.737 --> 12:36.403
I am a natural actor, but I have never

12:36.439 --> 12:38.472
- acted naturally in my life.
- Jennifer...

12:38.508 --> 12:41.608
This is why we're here.

12:41.644 --> 12:43.777
You look adorable. Okay?

12:43.813 --> 12:47.448
- Ugh.
- You can handle this.

12:47.484 --> 12:49.583
Go get 'em.

12:49.619 --> 12:51.885
Ew.

12:51.921 --> 12:53.221
Ooh, where'd you get that?

12:56.626 --> 12:57.758
Hoo.

13:10.651 --> 13:12.106
Hi-ya, sailor.

13:15.609 --> 13:17.409
Actually, I'm not military.

13:17.412 --> 13:19.651
And this is not a NAVY installation.

13:22.199 --> 13:24.332
What would you say if I told you

13:24.354 --> 13:25.719
that I was just a nerdy typist

13:25.755 --> 13:28.755
with a thing for Asimov and magnets?

13:28.791 --> 13:31.925
Magnets are my 9-5, so I
can't say I'm drawn to them.

13:34.664 --> 13:37.731
I guess opposites attract.

13:39.702 --> 13:42.836
Tour of the lab? What do you say?

13:42.872 --> 13:43.838
Atta girl.

13:46.307 --> 13:48.574
It's not as easy as that.

13:50.588 --> 13:55.158
What you are asking,
I've asked myself often.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.563
It's the ever-present
temptation of that machine.

14:01.599 --> 14:03.699
What I'm asking for is a favor.

14:07.138 --> 14:10.072
Is that why you refused
to join the mission?

14:10.108 --> 14:12.641
- Causality alone...
- Won't matter

14:12.677 --> 14:14.676
if they succeed.

14:14.712 --> 14:19.648
- Dr. Railly...
- Jones, I've come all this way

14:19.684 --> 14:23.685
to the end for you.

14:23.721 --> 14:26.889
What I've given...

14:26.925 --> 14:28.599
What I have yet to give...

14:31.226 --> 14:33.226
I've never asked for anything.

14:33.823 --> 14:35.423
So if we still have time

14:35.426 --> 14:38.317
while we still have
this machine, please...

14:40.402 --> 14:41.694
let me have this.

14:57.088 --> 15:01.123
Dr. Adler, I need you to
run a scan on the database.

15:01.159 --> 15:03.959
I want to access the coordinates
of a recent tether history.

15:03.995 --> 15:06.595
Of course. What are you searching for?

15:06.631 --> 15:07.697
A secret.

15:31.689 --> 15:36.024
Excuse me? Are you Amelia Morrison?

15:36.060 --> 15:39.995
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:40.031 --> 15:41.831
I had to drop my daughter
off at her rehearsal

15:41.833 --> 15:44.533
and with this weather, mid-town
traffic was a nightmare.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.936
So anyhow, I'm here.

15:47.972 --> 15:49.838
I think your story is fascinating.

15:49.874 --> 15:52.474
I'm really excited to
discuss your document.

15:53.642 --> 15:55.101
So am I.

15:55.102 --> 15:58.844
I appreciate you meeting
me on such short notice,

15:58.847 --> 16:00.006
Dr. Railly.

16:09.196 --> 16:12.931
Listen, I can get into a
bit of a pickle for this.

16:12.967 --> 16:16.868
Right. Big pickle.

16:16.904 --> 16:18.637
- What is that?
- That is one of

16:18.673 --> 16:20.839
the most powerful
magnets in North America.

16:20.875 --> 16:24.242
We've been experimenting
with electromagnetic pulses

16:24.278 --> 16:26.411
and their affect on machinery.

16:26.447 --> 16:29.681
Wow, wow, wowee.

16:30.885 --> 16:33.418
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:33.454 --> 16:35.553
All this bullshit about God.

16:35.589 --> 16:38.456
He doesn't forgive, he forgets.

16:38.492 --> 16:41.893
Cole, you can make another choice.

16:41.929 --> 16:44.896
Is that what you think's gonna happen?

16:44.932 --> 16:47.299
Gonna change my mind?

16:47.335 --> 16:50.468
All these visions, floating
around in your head,

16:50.504 --> 16:53.838
you still can't see who I really am.

16:53.874 --> 16:58.476
You think this'll be the
first kid I put a gun on.

16:58.512 --> 17:00.378
I am a murderer.

17:00.414 --> 17:01.613
Men, women and children.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.483
Ramse.

17:13.928 --> 17:16.060
Use to be, all I wanted was forgiveness.

17:16.063 --> 17:17.762
Now I just want it to end, so let's...

17:17.765 --> 17:21.633
get what we came here for.

17:21.669 --> 17:23.301
Finish this.

17:28.242 --> 17:31.176
This is more than any one person

17:31.212 --> 17:34.312
should feel in a lifetime.

17:34.348 --> 17:36.381
I mean, I've consulted privately before.

17:36.417 --> 17:39.517
I've profiled subjects based
on letters and journals.

17:39.553 --> 17:42.187
But this...

17:42.223 --> 17:45.190
On the surface it looks like...

17:45.226 --> 17:46.725
Madness?

17:46.761 --> 17:48.827
- Psychosis.
- This isn't the work

17:48.863 --> 17:52.664
of a madman, just a broken one.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.898
Set aside the content...

17:53.934 --> 17:55.934
The obsession with death and time...

17:55.970 --> 17:58.046
And approach it clinically.

17:58.047 --> 18:00.127
Right side associates with mothers...

18:00.130 --> 18:02.092
the left side with fathers.

18:02.093 --> 18:04.344
References are pushed to the margins.

18:04.345 --> 18:06.678
He only had a vague sense of these.

18:06.681 --> 18:10.934
Some are bold and
erratic... signs of rage.

18:10.935 --> 18:12.935
And others are quite delicate.

18:12.938 --> 18:16.354
Signs of intellect and lucidity.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.556
I mean, and here...

18:20.261 --> 18:22.761
I'm sorry.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.563
I'd never seen you work before.

18:25.599 --> 18:28.700
I was told you were a
brilliant psychologist, but...

18:28.736 --> 18:33.405
Oh, well, it's good to be
held in such high regard.

18:33.441 --> 18:37.409
Um, this... this, here.

18:37.445 --> 18:40.912
"The Requiem of 1827."

18:40.948 --> 18:42.881
That was a bad year for brilliance.

18:42.917 --> 18:46.818
The death of Beethoven and
the artist William Blake.

18:46.854 --> 18:51.189
Both outsiders, both plagued by genius.

18:51.225 --> 18:54.592
And there are references to Van Gogh,

18:54.628 --> 18:56.461
Plato's Theomania, the divine.

18:56.497 --> 19:00.365
But what is all this say about him?

19:00.401 --> 19:02.467
Oh, that he's exceptional.

19:02.503 --> 19:05.804
And damaged, and aware that he's both.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.274
But also incredibly uncertain.

19:09.310 --> 19:12.477
- Of what?
- Of himself.

19:12.513 --> 19:15.680
Of whether what he is is who he is

19:15.716 --> 19:20.252
or whether he was made to be that way.

19:27.461 --> 19:30.495
What is this?

19:30.531 --> 19:33.631
The symbology, I have no idea.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.354
But the image itself haunts him.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.669
You've hidden these from me.

19:38.672 --> 19:40.475
He needn't be reminded, nor you informed

19:40.478 --> 19:42.985
- of every eventuality.
- He is the Witness.

19:42.986 --> 19:44.919
His gift is how we defend him.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.457
The boy is my charge, not the man.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.348
If he believes the future is written,

19:49.350 --> 19:52.183
then no choice shall
ever truly be his own.

19:52.219 --> 19:55.887
Perhaps there is what may
be and what is meant to be.

19:55.923 --> 19:58.790
You forget your station.

19:58.826 --> 20:02.527
You were chosen to teach...
Arithmetic, history...

20:02.563 --> 20:04.362
Not to shape.

20:04.398 --> 20:06.898
We will make him into
the man who makes himself.

20:06.934 --> 20:08.433
And should you falter again,

20:08.461 --> 20:10.044
I will thank you for your sacrifice.

20:10.055 --> 20:11.654
Do you understand?

20:17.711 --> 20:20.345
Run along, my love.

20:20.381 --> 20:23.414
Off you pop to Mr. Hockley.

20:23.450 --> 20:27.152
Sunday best for tonight's
ceremony, remember?

20:29.190 --> 20:30.589
Go.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.898
"Time present and time past

20:39.934 --> 20:45.203
are perhaps both
present in time future."

20:45.239 --> 20:47.472
"Oh, make me a mask

20:47.508 --> 20:51.242
of the sharp, enameled eyes
and the spectacled claws."

20:51.278 --> 20:53.378
Dylan Thomas.

20:53.414 --> 20:56.814
Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Thoreau.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.584
Oh, yeah, and even my personal
favorite, Emily Dickinson.

20:59.620 --> 21:03.855
"Forever is composed entirely of nows."

21:03.891 --> 21:05.559
My mother loved her too.

21:08.429 --> 21:12.533
There are a number of
references to groups

21:12.582 --> 21:14.768
and ideologies... cults, religions...

21:14.771 --> 21:18.038
and the words are emphatic.

21:18.039 --> 21:21.959
But the writing is filled with contempt,

21:21.960 --> 21:25.493
like a person who hates
what he believes to be true.

21:26.547 --> 21:29.781
Such a handsome boy.

21:29.817 --> 21:33.685
My special boy.

21:33.721 --> 21:37.722
So, tonight,

21:37.758 --> 21:40.858
you will offer the
future to your chosen.

21:40.894 --> 21:43.164
And reunite the others with their past.

21:49.536 --> 21:51.270
I don't want to do it again.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.874
I mustn't harm all
those poor, sorry people.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.744
Mind yourself, child.

22:02.149 --> 22:06.818
Their fates must fall from your hand.

22:10.758 --> 22:14.259
Because for now, you
are the vessel of time.

22:14.295 --> 22:18.696
But one day, when you return to Titan,

22:18.732 --> 22:21.299
you shall be the master of it.

22:21.335 --> 22:24.202
And when that day comes,

22:24.238 --> 22:28.339
time will do what you command be done.

22:28.375 --> 22:29.741
Hm.

22:31.679 --> 22:34.779
Ahh.

22:34.815 --> 22:37.649
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:37.685 --> 22:39.450
I have this condition.

22:39.486 --> 22:43.421
It's called thromboembolism.

22:43.457 --> 22:45.523
It's Latin for "time bomb."

22:45.559 --> 22:48.212
It's manageable until...

22:49.519 --> 22:50.631
it's not.

22:53.738 --> 22:55.738
You haven't told your daughter

23:02.876 --> 23:04.909
I understand why you wouldn't.

23:04.945 --> 23:09.213
She knows. Kids know.

23:09.249 --> 23:13.951
Just can't, uh, bring myself
to talk to her about it.

23:13.987 --> 23:18.965
'Cause she's ten times as strong
as I'm giving her credit for.

23:19.902 --> 23:21.426
Do you have kids?

23:24.765 --> 23:27.265
It helps, you know.

23:27.301 --> 23:30.668
Telling the truth.

23:30.704 --> 23:33.938
Let's not make this document

23:33.974 --> 23:36.808
the most honest thing in the room.

23:36.844 --> 23:40.478
Whoever wrote this is not your client

23:40.514 --> 23:43.850
or a patient or a friend.

23:49.223 --> 23:50.722
He's my son.

23:56.342 --> 23:58.464
You know, I spent my
whole life believing

23:58.467 --> 24:00.216
that I was gonna destroy the world.

24:00.220 --> 24:01.585
Mom said I would.

24:01.621 --> 24:03.320
Olivia showed me how.

24:03.356 --> 24:08.792
So I thought, you know, this
is who I am, this is what I do.

24:08.851 --> 24:12.052
A person who does a thing
like that can't be good, right?

24:12.065 --> 24:14.164
- But you didn't.
- Because someone showed me

24:14.200 --> 24:15.499
another way.

24:15.535 --> 24:18.802
A better way.

24:18.838 --> 24:21.205
- Remember, Otter Eyes?
- Jesus, Jennifer,

24:21.241 --> 24:23.574
will you stop calling me that?

24:23.610 --> 24:25.709
You know why I do?

24:25.745 --> 24:29.179
Or why I'm so afraid
of Olivia's death stare?

24:29.215 --> 24:33.584
Because the eyes are the only
part of a person that can't lie.

24:33.620 --> 24:37.433
So you look into someone's
eyes and believe those.

24:47.734 --> 24:50.086
Oh, oh.

24:50.128 --> 24:52.328
About time. We've got three hours

24:52.331 --> 24:53.818
before the Guardians
arrive at that house.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.372
You got the package?

24:57.444 --> 24:59.676
Shit.

24:59.712 --> 25:01.979
- We mobile?
- I'm working on it.

25:03.450 --> 25:04.715
Intruder alert.

25:06.719 --> 25:08.786
Any time, Deacon.

25:09.823 --> 25:11.288
Whoo.

25:18.832 --> 25:22.232
Buckle up, 'cause we are not
stopping for walls or doors.

25:33.079 --> 25:35.145
We've gone through the logs.

25:35.181 --> 25:38.215
I've mapped the signal back
to the point of termination.

25:38.251 --> 25:40.551
Enter the coordinates.

25:40.587 --> 25:43.420
Katarina, splintering
alone to this moment...

25:43.456 --> 25:47.125
Of all moments... It's
unspeakably dangerous.

25:49.062 --> 25:51.028
Initiate splinter sequence.

26:03.476 --> 26:06.477
I had him when I was young.

26:06.513 --> 26:09.046
Very young.

26:09.082 --> 26:13.217
He was taken from me
and this document...

26:13.253 --> 26:18.155
Or whatever it is, his confession...

26:18.191 --> 26:22.059
it's all that I really
have to know him by.

26:27.634 --> 26:30.234
The things he's done...

26:39.345 --> 26:40.611
They were horrible.

26:55.061 --> 26:59.796
Nobody wants to think that
something that came from them

26:59.832 --> 27:01.231
can be worse than them.

27:04.868 --> 27:08.036
You can make a bad
thing and still be good.

27:09.642 --> 27:13.110
Them first, then us.

27:16.149 --> 27:19.449
Where are we? When are we?

27:19.485 --> 27:22.019
The same night.

27:22.451 --> 27:26.118
You cannot look at this
like the ravings of a mad man

27:26.154 --> 27:29.889
or the manifesto of a lunatic.

27:29.925 --> 27:32.058
It's a work of art.

27:32.094 --> 27:34.994
It's an incredible expression of...

27:35.030 --> 27:38.431
Of pain, of love, of despair

27:38.467 --> 27:40.834
and anger and incredible hope.

27:43.739 --> 27:47.907
It's a story. His story.

27:47.943 --> 27:51.043
It's not of what he is but...

27:51.079 --> 27:53.512
But what he wants to be.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.148
Finally know where they're all gonna be.

27:55.150 --> 27:57.783
- But we gotta go after them.
- We will.

27:57.819 --> 28:00.687
We'll come back to this
moment, armed and ready.

28:03.792 --> 28:06.592
Most kids you couldn't drag to a museum.

28:06.628 --> 28:09.061
Me, you couldn't drag away.

28:09.097 --> 28:11.697
I just love art.

28:11.733 --> 28:15.501
Literature, sculpture, you name it.

28:15.537 --> 28:19.538
I just could never make it.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.774
Oh...

28:21.810 --> 28:24.810
I didn't make nothing, though.

28:24.846 --> 28:27.647
I had a kid.

28:27.683 --> 28:30.449
I made her.

28:30.477 --> 28:33.177
And you can burn down the
Met and the Musée d'Orsay,

28:33.221 --> 28:37.824
because my Cassie, well,
there's no museum good enough.

28:41.396 --> 28:44.630
- Did you ever take her?
- Cassandra? To a museum?

28:48.103 --> 28:50.536
Art isn't her thing.

28:50.572 --> 28:52.038
No, one day, she'll be saving lives,

28:52.074 --> 28:55.608
not... not examining them.

28:58.213 --> 29:01.814
You should ask her to go with you.

29:01.850 --> 29:03.916
Tell her you need her to.

29:03.952 --> 29:07.753
Drag her, if you have to.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.723
Tell her she'll regret
it if she doesn't.

29:12.394 --> 29:14.727
I, uh, have to go, Kathryn.

29:14.763 --> 29:17.697
I know you.

29:17.733 --> 29:19.566
I can't place you, but I...

29:23.672 --> 29:26.105
Thank you.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.308
For everything.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.750
Never give up on family.

29:39.588 --> 29:42.955
You fight. Win or lose.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.891
It's what mothers do.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.426
Ah!

30:23.431 --> 30:26.899
Jones, I need you to send me to 1953.

30:26.935 --> 30:27.900
I...

30:27.936 --> 30:31.070
Dr. Railly, enough.

30:31.106 --> 30:34.607
I think it's time we had a talk.

30:34.643 --> 30:37.477
Mother to mother.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.781
- Jones, you don't understand.
- Correction, Dr. Railly,

30:51.817 --> 30:53.849
I didn't understand.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.918
But I do now.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.219
Finally.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.125
Stop! Ramse, stop!

31:06.573 --> 31:10.941
Why would Mr. Cole kill
his brother, if not for you?

31:10.969 --> 31:13.102
Why would Ramse want to kill you,

31:13.138 --> 31:16.038
if not for his brother?

31:16.074 --> 31:19.108
Betrayal requires blindness.

31:19.144 --> 31:22.378
So I went back to see.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.748
I didn't come here to kill the Witness.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.284
I came here to kill his mother.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.657
Look me in the eye, Dr. Railly

31:34.693 --> 31:38.294
and tell me, are they open now?

31:45.137 --> 31:47.137
This isn't gonna buy us much time.

31:49.248 --> 31:52.641
We go in fast, we breach, we clear.

31:52.686 --> 31:54.251
Kill 'em all.

31:57.842 --> 31:59.389
You lied to me.

31:59.493 --> 32:02.160
You made what family we had into fools.

32:02.163 --> 32:06.316
Katarina, the Witness can be saved.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.090
Please, it could already be too late.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.326
For your sake, I should hope we are.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.862
But the clocks might stop
and history is rewritten

32:12.898 --> 32:15.598
before I should decide
what to do with you.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.667
But for now, Dr. Railly,
you and I, we are going

32:18.703 --> 32:21.604
to stay in this room, together

32:21.640 --> 32:23.906
until the end of time.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.256
Jones.

32:40.292 --> 32:44.193
I'm sorry.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.361
Take her down!

32:48.166 --> 32:49.098
Ugh!

33:09.017 --> 33:10.649
Where's Lucinda?

33:16.761 --> 33:18.827
Mr. Hockley, protect the Witness!

33:21.967 --> 33:22.799
Ah!

33:29.774 --> 33:32.107
Ahh. Ow!

33:55.367 --> 33:57.032
Damn it.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.668
They've come for me.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.870
Down the hall!

34:01.906 --> 34:04.673
Father. Mother too.

34:04.709 --> 34:08.349
Come, Athan. Stay close
and be quick about it.

34:10.949 --> 34:14.159
No! Ah, please.

34:14.196 --> 34:18.164
Whatever this is,
we're not a part of it.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.800
Oh, no!

34:20.835 --> 34:22.368
It's not what...

34:22.404 --> 34:25.204
They were giving up! They were good!

34:25.239 --> 34:26.639
I'm not.

34:36.150 --> 34:37.083
Oh!

34:56.204 --> 34:58.237
The symbols.

34:58.273 --> 35:01.107
- You see them too?
- Yes.

35:01.143 --> 35:04.076
What do they mean?

35:04.112 --> 35:05.345
I don't know.

35:08.049 --> 35:10.683
You're like me.

35:10.719 --> 35:14.019
You're Primary.

35:14.055 --> 35:16.523
I don't think I've
ever been like anybody.

35:19.995 --> 35:23.462
I don't think you're like me at all.

35:23.498 --> 35:26.332
I think you're better.

35:26.368 --> 35:28.567
But one day,

35:28.603 --> 35:32.705
I think that you will
be the best of us all.

35:43.819 --> 35:44.651
Go.

36:43.345 --> 36:45.378
- Ahh!
- Ah, ah!

37:09.835 --> 37:13.005
You can't have him.

37:22.135 --> 37:25.269
The Witness foresaw this very moment.

37:25.306 --> 37:29.307
That the vessel which made
him would come to unmake him.

37:29.343 --> 37:31.977
- No.
- Yes, he rejected you.

37:32.013 --> 37:36.081
He pushed himself from
your body and into my hands.

37:36.117 --> 37:41.353
- Ahh!
- You took him from me!

37:41.389 --> 37:43.321
Did I?

37:45.467 --> 37:48.201
Did you love him? Do you love him now?

37:50.698 --> 37:54.099
Or do you just feel him
gone, like a phantom limb?

37:56.377 --> 38:00.112
I've taken one, Cassandra.
I will take them all.

38:07.682 --> 38:10.248
He'll never even know you were here.

38:10.284 --> 38:13.385
- You're nothing.
- I'm his mother.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.221
You're an undeserving bitch!

38:17.358 --> 38:19.190
Ahh!

38:19.193 --> 38:21.537
No. No!

38:21.568 --> 38:22.712
No!

38:30.671 --> 38:32.904
Mind yourself.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.040
Ah!

38:38.079 --> 38:41.046
No!

38:49.441 --> 38:50.907
It needn't be like this.

38:50.909 --> 38:53.024
Please, James. The boy
needn't become the man.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.592
He doesn't want... oh!

40:07.034 --> 40:08.934
Athan.

40:13.007 --> 40:14.339
Your name is Athan.

40:23.818 --> 40:26.084
Cole?

40:26.120 --> 40:27.319
He's my son.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.039
No!

40:49.009 --> 40:50.142
Oh.

40:53.781 --> 40:55.947
We'll find him.

40:55.983 --> 40:57.182
We can't go back.

40:57.218 --> 41:00.885
Jones knows. She'll kill us.

41:00.921 --> 41:02.086
We're on our own, now.

41:06.861 --> 41:10.829
Cassie, Cole.

41:10.865 --> 41:12.192
Stop 'em!

41:16.209 --> 41:19.616
- Cole.
- Oh, no.

41:20.514 --> 41:23.286
Jesus. Get her out of here.

41:25.497 --> 41:27.042
What happened?

41:27.081 --> 41:28.500
I saw his eyes.

41:39.844 --> 41:41.594
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:41.657 --> 41:44.462
Deacon's upstairs. He needs help.

41:44.498 --> 41:46.264
Cole?

41:46.300 --> 41:48.132
What the hell is this?

41:48.168 --> 41:51.302
I'm sorry. We're sorry.

41:51.338 --> 41:53.972
For all of it.

41:54.008 --> 41:56.482
Do not come after us.

41:58.794 --> 42:01.761
This is ours to fix.

42:01.782 --> 42:03.381
It's our family.

42:06.887 --> 42:08.253
Synchronize.

42:23.875 --> 42:24.915
Hannah!

42:25.449 --> 42:26.891
Oh, God, no.

42:28.431 --> 42:29.376
Hannah?

42:29.379 --> 42:31.548
Here, here, I can get her.

42:33.969 --> 42:35.202
Hannah?

42:37.173 --> 42:38.506
Stay with me, Hannah.

42:40.743 --> 42:42.075
The IV!

42:50.019 --> 42:51.285
Another compress.

42:53.089 --> 42:55.856
Stay awake. Hannah. Hannah?

42:55.892 --> 42:57.124
Open your eyes.

43:12.976 --> 43:14.842
This whole time...

43:18.047 --> 43:19.847
the entire mission...

43:22.752 --> 43:24.018
all of it...

43:26.756 --> 43:28.923
it's been about them.

43:41.704 --> 43:44.005
You do know what we have to do, right?

43:48.177 --> 43:49.543
Yes.

43:54.217 --> 43:55.750
May God have mercy.
