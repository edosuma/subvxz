I WANT TO BE A WITCH
WHEN I GROW UP.

YOU'RE THE GRAY LADY.

1:10:44.507 --> 1:10:48.343

HOW MANY DO YOU THINK WILL COME?

1:10:58.321 --> 1:11:01.389
- I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY'S GOING TO COME.

1:11:01.391 --> 1:11:04.859
- WHY NOT?

1:11:04.861 --> 1:11:07.895
BUT THEIR PARENTS
WOULDN'T LET THEM.

1:11:09.832 --> 1:11:11.833

HOW DO I GET RID
OF THE BUNNIES?

1:11:21.311 --> 1:11:23.544
- HMM. I WARNED YOU
NOT TO DREAM ABOUT THEM.

1:11:23.546 --> 1:11:24.946
- I COULDN'T HELP IT.

1:11:24.948 --> 1:11:28.116
- WELL, THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID
OF DREAM BUNNIES

1:11:28.118 --> 1:11:30.685
IS TO HAVE THEM CHASED
BY DREAM PUPPIES.

1:11:30.687 --> 1:11:31.853
- PUPPIES?

1:11:31.855 --> 1:11:34.589

DID YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

THINK MAYBE YOUR HUSBAND
WAS THE CULPRIT.

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:44.792
- YEAH, BUT MY DOCTOR WAS
SO PESSIMISTIC.

1:12:44.794 --> 1:12:47.128
- OH, WELL, SOMETIMES
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF RELAXING

1:12:47.130 --> 1:12:48.429
AND LETTING NATURE
FIND A WAY.

1:12:48.431 --> 1:12:52.300

- THEY'RE GOING TO BE BOOKED,
AND THEN,

1:19:01.437 --> 1:19:03.037
THEY'LL GO IN FRONT OF A JUDGE
IN JUVENILE COURT.

1:19:03.039 --> 1:19:04.538
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:06.774
- THEY BROKE THE LAW.
THEY VANDALIZED CASSIE'S SHOP.

DON'T LET HIM DO THIS.

BECAUSE SOMEONE PUT
IN THEIR HEADS

THAT EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
NEEDS TO ACT THE SAME
AND LOOK THE SAME.

JUST GET ON YOUR BROOMSTICK
AND GET OUT.

- OK. DEREK,
PUT THESE TWO IN A CELL.

1:19:48.985 --> 1:19:50.217
THEY NEED
A LITTLE QUIET TIME

1:19:50.219 --> 1:19:51.552
TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT THEY'VE DONE WRONG.

- NO. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PROTECT ME, CASSIE.

1:19:58.528 --> 1:20:00.094
- NO. IT'S ABOUT THE BOYS.

YOU COULD BE THE NEXT MAYOR.

1:21:00.990 --> 1:21:02.756
OF COURSE,
THERE IS A RESIDENCY LAW.

1:21:02.758 --> 1:21:04.491
YOU'D HAVE TO STICK AROUND
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

1:21:04.493 --> 1:21:07.094
- I DON'T WANT TO BE THE MAYOR.
I JUST WANT...

1:21:07.096 --> 1:21:08.596
- A REAL HOME.

1:21:09.731 --> 1:21:13.300
WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE...

1:21:13.302 --> 1:21:14.501
LIKE ME.

1:21:15.770 --> 1:21:18.405
- YOU CAST QUITE A SPELL,
CHIEF RUSSELL.

1:21:18.407 --> 1:21:20.341
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE STAYING?

1:21:28.750 --> 1:21:30.584
- THERE. THAT'S IT.
LET'S GET THIS STUFF...

1:21:30.586 --> 1:21:32.887

HOW'S IT GOING?

1:21:54.210 --> 1:22:00.281
- WELL, I THINK THESE BOYS HAVE
A FUTURE IN RENOVATION.

1:22:00.283 --> 1:22:01.949

AND CHECK OUT THE DAMAGE.

1:22:01.951 --> 1:22:03.784

DON'T HANDLE BROKEN GLASS.

1:22:32.915 --> 1:22:36.350
- RIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE A BR--

1:22:39.788 --> 1:22:42.389
THAT BROOM.
HOW DID THAT GET HERE?

1:22:42.391 --> 1:22:45.659
- SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BROUGHT IT.

1:22:45.661 --> 1:22:48.462

THE DOOR WAS LOCKED,

1:22:48.464 --> 1:22:50.497
AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
SINCE THEN, SO...

1:22:50.499 --> 1:22:53.467

A PERFECTLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

1:22:53.469 --> 1:22:56.537

A WITCH'S BROOM.

1:22:56.539 --> 1:23:01.976
- AND WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

1:23:01.978 --> 1:23:03.877
YOU'RE NOT A WITCH,
ARE YOU?

- SILLY.
