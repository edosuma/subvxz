WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:04.082
"AFRICAN CAPITAL
ON ITS OWN RIVER."

00:04.130 --> 00:06.212
NAIROBI.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.039
HEY, HON.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.876
HOW'D IT GO?

00:10.920 --> 00:15.573
WELL, WE BEAT THE BALLBARIANS
TWO GAMES TO ONE,

00:15.620 --> 00:17.963
THOUGH WITH NO HELP
FROM ME.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.796
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.148
I DON'T KNOW.
THE BALL FELT LIKE

00:21.190 --> 00:24.102
IT WEIGHED ABOUT
100 POUNDS, AND...

00:24.150 --> 00:25.924
AND THEN I STARTED
GETTING A SPLI'I'I'ING HEADACHE

00:25.980 --> 00:27.277
AROUND THE FIFTH FRAME.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.935
YOU DO LIKE A LITTLE
UNDER THE WEATHER.

00:29.980 --> 00:32.540
LET ME GET YOU
SOMETHING.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.799
WOMAN: WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE
TO RICHMOND THIS WEEKEND

00:36.860 --> 00:39.112
TO VISIT YOUR MOTHER.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.688
LORD HELP US
IF YOU GET HER SICK.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.258
CLAYTON?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.825
CLAYTON?

00:58.100 --> 01:01.706
CLAYTON! AAH!

01:01.750 --> 01:03.706
SIMMONS: I THINK
SOMETHING DIED IN HERE.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.014
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
THIS THING WAS CLEANED?

01:06.060 --> 01:08.187
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

01:08.240 --> 01:09.320
IF YOU FOUND A LUNCH BAG

01:09.370 --> 01:11.270
WITH HOOVER'S
INITIALS ON IT.

01:12.630 --> 01:15.849
IS GARCIA STILL HEADING
TO CALIFORNIA TODAY?

01:15.900 --> 01:17.379
JJ: YEAH.
HER MIND'S MADE UP.

01:17.420 --> 01:18.762
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:18.810 --> 01:21.722
UH, GARCIA'S FLYING
TO SAN FRANCISCO

01:21.770 --> 01:24.375
FOR A PAROLE HEARING
AT SAN QUENTIN.

01:24.430 --> 01:27.467
WHEN SHE WAS 18,
HER MOM AND STEP-DAD

01:27.520 --> 01:30.159
WERE KILLED
BY A DRUNK DRIVER.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.255
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.779
THE DRIVER GOT 25 YEARS

01:32.830 --> 01:34.695
FOR VEHICULAR HOMICIDE.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.527
HE'S BEEN BEHIND BARS
FOR THE LAST 20.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.128
SO SHE'S GOING TO GIVE
A VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT

01:39.180 --> 01:40.693
BEFORE THE BOARD?

01:40.750 --> 01:42.138
NO. ONE OF HER
STEPBROTHERS IS.

01:42.180 --> 01:45.798
NO, SHE'S NEVER GONE TO
ANY OF THE HEARINGS BEFORE.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.839
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE

01:48.890 --> 01:50.016
HALFWAY TO THE AIRPORT
BY NOW.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.709
MY CHARIOT AWAITS.
AND BY CHARIOT,

01:51.760 --> 01:53.239
I MEAN LYFI' DRIVER
NAMED CHUCK.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.498
JUST LE'I'I'ING YOU KNOW
THAT THE TABLETS

01:55.550 --> 01:56.938
AND THE FILES
ARE AT THE READY.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.413
I JUST NEED YOU
TO PRESS PLAY ON THE BIP-BEE.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.064
THE BIP

02:00.120 --> 02:01.803
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
THE REMOTE, THE BIP-BEE.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.202
AH, RIGHT. THANK YOU.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.854
AND THANK YOU FOR
GIVING ME THE TIME OFF.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.242
I KNOW IT'S REALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW,

02:06.300 --> 02:08.370
AND, YOU KNOW, BOY WONDER
OFF DOING HIS THINGAMAJIG.

02:08.430 --> 02:12.070
REID'S MANDATORY
FBI-REQUIRED SABBATICAL.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.121
YEAH. AND A SUPER ICKY CASE.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.161
LISTEN, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT US.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.825
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS IS TO YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.918
CARLOS IS DETERMINED
THAT JESSE WILSON

02:20.960 --> 02:22.348
SERVE OUT
HIS WHOLE SENTENCE.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.834
CARLOS IS THE YOUNGEST
OF YOUR STEPBROTHERS?

02:24.880 --> 02:28.395
YEAH. HE WAS 13
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

02:28.450 --> 02:31.408
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
GONNA BE OK OUT THERE?

02:31.450 --> 02:33.441
YEAH. I'M STAYING WITH
CARLOS AT THE HOUSE,

02:33.500 --> 02:35.149
AND THEN I'LL BE WORKING
REMOTELY WITH YOU GUYS HERE,

02:35.190 --> 02:36.327
MY FAMILY HERE.

02:36.370 --> 02:37.530
ABOUT THAT,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.012
WE CAN GET A TEMP.

02:39.070 --> 02:40.674
PISH POSH. I'M NOTHING
IF NOT THE QUEEN

02:40.720 --> 02:42.028
OF MULTI-TASKING
IN THE KINGDOM

02:42.070 --> 02:43.150
OF TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.633
SURE.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.932
OK, WELL,
HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.332
OK.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.853
PRENTISS:
THE CDC NEEDS OUR HELP.

02:53.910 --> 02:55.389
GARCIA WILL BE TAKING
SOME PERSONAL TIME,

02:55.430 --> 02:57.990
BUT SHE WILL WORK HER MAGIC
FROM THE WEST COAST.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.262
LAST NIGHT, CLAYTON OSBORNE,
45, OF ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA,

03:03.310 --> 03:05.084
DIED AFTER SPONTANEOUSLY
BLEEDING OUT.

03:05.140 --> 03:08.098
HE LOST NEARLY 50%
OF HIS TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.914
THIS COMES
JUST 24 HOURS

03:09.970 --> 03:12.438
AFI'ER SERENA LOGAN, 35,

03:12.490 --> 03:14.219
A LOAN OFFICER
AT A BANK,

03:14.280 --> 03:16.180
ALSO DIED FROM
MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.233
WHAT COULD CAUSE ABNORMAL
BLEEDING LIKE THIS?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.840
LEWIS: A VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC
FEVER, LIKE EBOLA,

03:21.890 --> 03:24.233
OR PERHAPS EXPOSURE
TO SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.678
WELL, IF THE CDC's
CALLING US,

03:25.720 --> 03:26.971
THEY MUST SUSPECT
BIOTERRORISM.

03:27.030 --> 03:28.065
THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO SPECULATE,

03:28.120 --> 03:29.508
BUT WE CAN'T
RULE THAT OUT.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.279
WELL, BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
HAVE BEEN CALLED

03:31.340 --> 03:33.114
THE POOR MAN'S ATOM BOMB.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.377
I MEAN, THE UNSUB
COULD HAVE WEAPONIZED

03:34.430 --> 03:37.251
SOME SORT OF VIRUS
OR BACTERIA OR TOXIN.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.813
LEWIS: WHATEVER IT IS,
WE DON'T KNOW

03:38.870 --> 03:40.861
IF THESE VICTIMS INHALED,
INGESTED, OR HANDLED IT.

03:40.910 --> 03:42.127
ROSSI: BESIDES THE OBVIOUS,

03:42.170 --> 03:44.126
I CAN SEE WHY
THE CDC IS NERVOUS.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.307
LAST NIGHT'S VICTIM
WAS A CIVILIAN ANALYST

03:46.350 --> 03:49.001
FOR THE DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

03:49.050 --> 03:52.133
YEAH. THE D.I.A. ASSESSES
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
INFORMATION

03:52.180 --> 03:54.740
FOR THE JOINT CHIEFS,
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,

03:54.790 --> 03:56.132
AND EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE.

03:56.190 --> 03:58.146
JJ: WERE THESE TWO TARGETED
OR JUST RANDOM VICTIMS?

03:58.190 --> 03:59.703
PRENTISS:
ALL WE KNOW IS WE HAVE

03:59.760 --> 04:02.274
TWO HIGHLY UNUSUAL DEATHS
IN JUST TWO DAYS.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.629
JJ, DAVE, THE CDC
IS SENDING A TEAM

04:04.670 --> 04:06.979
FROM ITS EPIDEMIC
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
TO THE OSBORNE HOUSE.

04:07.020 --> 04:08.578
GO SEE WHAT
THEY CAN TELL US.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.507
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE WILL BE
WORKING THIS CASE

04:10.550 --> 04:12.506
FROM OUR OWN BACKYARD.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.651
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.011
PRENTISS: "HOLDING ON TO ANGER
IS LIKE DRINKING POISON

05:27.060 --> 05:29.369
AND EXPECTING
THE OTHER PERSON TO DIE."

05:29.410 --> 05:30.536
ANONYMOUS.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.535
LEWIS: OK, THE FIRST
VICTIM, SERENA LOGAN,

05:32.590 --> 05:34.672
GOT DIVORCED, MOVED TO
VIRGINIA FROM FLORIDA

05:34.720 --> 05:36.506
TWO YEARS AGO FOR A JOB
WITH SOUTH WAY BANK.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.029
SIMMONS: SHE WAS ACTIVE
IN THE COMMUNITY,

05:38.070 --> 05:40.061
VOLUNTEERED AT
A NUMBER OF CHARITIES.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.374
SERENA WAS HIGH PROFILE,
BUT SHE LIVED
A LOW-RISK LIFESTYLE.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.990
CLAYTON OSBORNE,
BORN AND RAISED
IN ARLINGTON.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.689
HE AND HIS WIFE
BETH WERE MARRIED
FOR 19 YEARS.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.163
THEY HAVE ONE SON
WHO'S A FRESHMAN

05:49.210 --> 05:50.939
AT ROWAN UNIVERSITY
IN NEW JERSEY.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.218
CLAYTON HAD THE HIGHEST
GOVERNMENT SECURITY
CLEARANCE AT THE D.I.A.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.342
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT PROJECTS
HE WAS WORKING ON.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.699
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS
SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN VICTIMS.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.651
CLAYTON AND HIS WIFE
WERE CUSTOMERS

05:59.700 --> 06:01.395
AT THE BANK BRANCH
WHERE SERENA WORKED.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.226
IF SERENA AND CLAYTON MET,

06:03.270 --> 06:05.352
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD
HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.049
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
MAYBE THE WIFE FOUND OUT

06:07.100 --> 06:08.408
AND TOOK MATTERS
INTO HER OWN HANDS.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.010
PRENTISS: POISONING IS
TYPICALLY A FEMALE M.O.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.311
BETH OSBORNE'S
BEING QUARANTIN ED

06:12.370 --> 06:13.792
FOR OBSERVATION
IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.408
YEAH, IF IT ISN'T
A SCORNED WIFE,

06:15.460 --> 06:17.234
IT COULD BE A VIOLENT
EX-HUSBAND.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.329
I MEAN, SERENA AND HER EX,
UM, DAVID LOGAN,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.893
THEY WENT THROUGH
A NASTY DIVORCE.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.465
YEAH, SHE MOVED NORTH
RIGHT AFTER THAT.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.422
AND LOOKEE HERE.
DAVID MOVED TO ARLINGTON
JUST LAST MONTH.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.949
WELL, HE COULD HAVE
FOUND A WAY TO POISON

06:28.990 --> 06:30.389
HIS EX AND CLAYTON.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.079
PRENTISS: MATT, SEE IF YOU
CAN TRACK DOWN SERENA'S EX.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.427
TARA, LUKE,
TALK TO THE M.E.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.289
I'M GOING TO CALL
THE HOSPITAL.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.124
WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH BETH OSBORNE.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.860
LET THEM THROUGH.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.615
I'M SARA FREEMAN
WITH THE E.I.S.

06:43.660 --> 06:45.264
AGENTS ROSSI AND JAREAU.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.483
ANY IDEA WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH?

06:47.530 --> 06:49.088
WELL, WE'RE TAKING
AIR SAMPLES,

06:49.140 --> 06:50.448
BAGGING ALL FOOD
AND MEDICINE,

06:50.490 --> 06:52.355
TOILETRIES,
CLEANING SUPPLIES.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.490
JJ: COULD IT BE EBOLA?

06:53.540 --> 06:54.700
SERENA LOGAN

06:54.760 --> 06:56.318
AND CLAYTON OSBORNE

06:56.370 --> 06:57.758
HAD ALL THE SYMPTOMS.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.451
THEY DID. BUT THEIR
RISK WAS VIRTUALLY
NON-EXISTENT.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.888
NEITHER OF THEM HAD
BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY

07:01.940 --> 07:03.328
IN THE PAST YEAR.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.065
WHAT ELSE WOULD CAUSE THAT?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.371
WELL, THERE ARE
3 TYPES

07:06.420 --> 07:07.933
OF BIOLOGICAL
WEAPONS.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.458
FIRST THERE'S BACTERIA,
LIKE ANTHRAX,

07:10.510 --> 07:12.296
SALMONELLA,
OR THE PLAGUE.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.683
AND THEN THERE ARE
VIRUSES, LIKE EBOLA
AND SMALLPOX,

07:14.730 --> 07:16.550
ALTHOUGH SMALLPOX ONLY
EXISTS IN LABORATORIES.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.295
AND THEN FINALLY,
TOXINS, LIKE
BOTULINUM OR RICIN.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.511
VIRULENT STRAINS

07:21.570 --> 07:23.470
OF ALL 3 WEAPONS
COULD CAUSE MASSIVE

07:23.530 --> 07:25.395
SICKNESS AND DEATH.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.566
FREEMAN.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.259
YOU HAVE
CONFIRMATION?

07:29.310 --> 07:31.358
THAN KS.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.049
TESTS WERE CONDUCTED
ON BLOOD SAMPLES

07:33.100 --> 07:35.318
TAKEN FROM THE VICTIMS
AND MRS. OSBORNE.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.964
THEY CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.829
MEANING IT'S NOT EBOLA.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.448
WHOEVER'S DOING THIS
IS USING

07:40.500 --> 07:41.888
A NON-CONTAGIOUS
WEAPON.

07:41.930 --> 07:43.363
MAN: OFFICER FREEMAN,
YOU HAVE A SECOND?

07:43.410 --> 07:45.492
EH, EXCUSE ME.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.494
OVER HERE...

07:46.550 --> 07:47.938
A NON-CONTAGIOUS WEAPON

07:47.980 --> 07:50.289
THAT MAKES ITS VICTIMS
BLEED TO DEATH.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.592
IT'S NOT ON MY RADAR.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.371
MAYBE TARA OR LUKE
WILL GET LUCKY
WITH THE M.E.

07:55.430 --> 07:58.729
C.O.D. FOR BOTH VICTIMS
WAS MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE

07:58.780 --> 08:00.862
CAUSED BY CATASTROPHIC
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.389
MY EXAM SHOWED
THEY BOTH CONSUMED

08:02.430 --> 08:03.829
SOME TYPE OF ANTICOAGULANT.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.383
LEWIS:
WERE EITHER OF THEM
ON BLOOD THINNERS?

08:05.440 --> 08:07.431
WEISS: NOT MS. LOGAN,
BUT MR. OSBORNE

08:07.480 --> 08:09.471
WAS ON A DAILY
ASPIRIN REGIME.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.304
UNLESS THERE'S
AN UNDERLYING
MEDICAL ISSUE,

08:11.360 --> 08:12.782
BABY ASPIRIN
WOULDN'T CAUSE

08:12.840 --> 08:13.829
THIS KIND OF
MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.835
WEISS: NO, IT WOULD NOT.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.438
OTHER THAN
IN MEDICINES,

08:16.490 --> 08:18.401
ANTICOAGULANTS ARE FOUND
IN RODENTICIDES.

08:18.450 --> 08:19.530
COULDN'T ONE OF THOSE
HAVE DONE THIS?

08:19.580 --> 08:21.093
NOT COULD. IT DID.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.401
RAT POISON.

08:22.450 --> 08:23.883
IT WAS AMONG
THEIR STOMACH CONTENTS.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.238
CONSUMING RAT POISON

08:25.280 --> 08:26.622
WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY
PAINFUL WAY TO DIE.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.763
OUR UNSUB WANTS
HIS VICTIMS TO SUFFER.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.061
I'M GOING TO TEXT GARCIA,

08:31.110 --> 08:33.066
SEE IF SHE CAN CHECK SALES
OF IT IN THE AREA.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.508
HOW FAST-ACTING
IS RAT POISON?

08:34.550 --> 08:37.155
MOST TODAY
CONTAIN SO-CALLED
SUPER-WARFARINS.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.371
SUPER ANTICOAGULANTS,
IF YOU WILL.

08:39.430 --> 08:40.909
WITHOUT TREATMENT,
THE WINDOW OF DEATH

08:40.950 --> 08:43.601
CAN VARY FROM A FEW DAYS
TO JUST A FEW HOURS.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.383
BETH: THERE WAS
BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.658
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.561
MRS. OSBORNE,
DID YOUR HUSBAND

08:55.620 --> 08:58.578
HAVE AN ARGUMENT
WITH ANYONE RECENTLY?

08:58.620 --> 09:00.269
ANY ENEMIES?

09:00.320 --> 09:02.788
FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS,
CLAYTON WALKED AROUND

09:02.840 --> 09:05.445
WITH A HAIRCUT HE HATED.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.492
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
DISLOYAL OR UPSET HIS BARBER

09:08.540 --> 09:10.588
BY SWITCHING TO A NEW ONE.

09:10.630 --> 09:12.803
DID HE EVER TALK
ABOUT THE PROJECTS
HE WAS WORKING ON

09:12.850 --> 09:14.499
FOR THE D.I.A.?

09:14.550 --> 09:17.599
HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH.
HE COULDN'T, REALLY,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.689
SINCE MOST OF IT
WAS TOP-SECRET, BUT...

09:20.730 --> 09:24.427
BUT THAT WAS CLAY.

09:24.470 --> 09:27.644
HE WAS THE MOST HONEST
AND ETHICAL MAN

09:27.690 --> 09:29.510
YOU WOULD EVER MEET.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.563
DID HE EVER MENTION
ANY UNUSUAL

09:32.610 --> 09:34.692
OR UNETHICAL
ACTIVITY GOING ON?

09:34.740 --> 09:40.133
NO. DOES THE FBI THINK
HIS WORK HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.784
WE NEED TO CHECK
EVERYTHING.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.741
LIKE HIS DAILY ROUTINE.
DID HE HAVE ONE?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.665
EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING,
HE'D EAT BREAKFAST

09:46.710 --> 09:48.621
AT A CAFE BY OUR HOME.

09:48.670 --> 09:53.198
HE'D WORK FROM 8:00 TO 6:00,
THEN HOME FOR DINNER AT 6:30.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.937
EXCEPT TUESDAYS,
HIS BOWLING NIGHT.

09:56.980 --> 10:00.984
DOES THE NAME SERENA LOGAN
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

10:01.030 --> 10:03.339
SERENA LOGAN.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.507
I'M SORRY. SHOULD IT?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.596
NO.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.770
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO MEET
OUR SON KEVIN.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.425
HE'S DRIVING DOWN
FROM SCHOOL.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.560
OF COURSE.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.129
HOW DO I EXPLAIN IT?

10:22.050 --> 10:25.577
HOW DO I EXPLAIN WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIS FATHER?

10:25.620 --> 10:28.259
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
DO THIS TO HIM?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.572
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.498
HEY, THANKS FOR PICKING
ME UP AT THE AIRPORT.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.586
ANYTHING FOR
MY FAVORITE SISTER.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.325
OH, THAT IS VERY SWEET.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.802
I'M ALSO YOUR ONLY
SISTER.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.760
HA HA! YEP.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.596
OH, I SAW THAT THE BOWMANS
PAINTED THEIR HOUSE
DOWN THE STREET.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.687
I--I LOVED THAT LIME GREEN,
BUT IT DOES LOOK NICE.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.207
THE BOWMANS MOVED.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.682
THERE'S A YOUNG COUPLE
WITH THEIR BABY

10:56.740 --> 10:57.957
IN THERE RIGHT NOW.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.774
THEY MOVED?
WHERE'D THEY MOVE?

10:59.830 --> 11:01.343
ASSISTED LIVING,
PROBABLY.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.039
THE BOWMANS WERE LIKE
A THOUSAND YEARS OLD

11:03.090 --> 11:04.955
WHEN ME AND YOU
WERE KIDS.

11:05.010 --> 11:06.659
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME BACK MORE OFTEN

11:06.700 --> 11:08.133
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP UP.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.704
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.921
I'M KIDDING.
LOOK, YOU'RE BUSY,

11:10.970 --> 11:13.530
AND YOU HAVE
A SUPER COOL
AND IMPORTANT JOB,

11:13.580 --> 11:15.753
AND I GET IT.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.052
IT IS KIND OF MAGNIFICENT.

11:18.110 --> 11:21.147
YEAH, AND EVERYBODY'S
REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.668
I KNOW MOM AND DAD
WOULD BE, TOO.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.972
IF ONLY THEY COULD
SEE YOU NOW.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.371
ARE YOU STILL
INSTALLING POOLS?

11:31.420 --> 11:34.241
NAH. I OPENED UP
MY OWN BUSINESS.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.218
"CARLOS GARCIA,
PROFESSIONAL HOUSE PAINTER."

11:39.260 --> 11:40.295
THE BOWMANS?

11:40.350 --> 11:41.601
YOU SAID IT LOOKED NICE.

11:41.650 --> 11:42.867
IT DOES LOOK NICE!

11:42.910 --> 11:44.605
IT DOES LOOK NICE,
RIGHT?
OHH!

11:44.660 --> 11:47.606
SO GLAD YOU CAME, SIS.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.616
YEAH. WE CAN'T LET
THAT SON OF A BITCH

11:49.660 --> 11:51.742
GET OUT OF PRISON EARLY.

11:51.790 --> 11:54.008
YEAH. RIGHT.

11:54.060 --> 11:57.530
I'M GONNA TAKE THESE UP
FOR YOU.

12:01.450 --> 12:04.806
OH, HEY. THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWERS.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.750
I NEVER REMEMBER
TO DO THAT.

12:06.810 --> 12:07.765
FLOWERS?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.539
THE TULIPS
AT THE CEMETERY.

12:09.590 --> 12:11.729
I ALWAYS VISIT
MOM AND DAD'S GRAVE

12:11.770 --> 12:13.761
ON THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THEIR PASSING,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.425
AND, UM, WITHOUT FAIL
EVERY YEAR,

12:16.470 --> 12:19.075
YOUR FLOWERS ARE THERE.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.678
CARLOS, I DON'T--

12:23.000 --> 12:24.342
AH, IT'S WORK.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.039
IT'S OK.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.603
GARCIA READY,
WILLING, AND ABLE.

12:27.650 --> 12:30.437
HEY. IT'S JJ AND LUKE.
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.300
IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS SMOOTH.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.659
THEY GAVE US COOKIES.
IT'S HOW I WISH
THE WORLD WAS.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.702
GARCIA, DID YOU GET MY TEXT
ABOUT RODENTICIDE SALES?

12:38.750 --> 12:41.218
YES. I DID SOME DIGITAL
DIGGING FROM 38,000 FEET.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.238
IT IS AMAZING
WHAT A HOT-TICKET ITEM
RAT POISON IS.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.622
BUT WITHOUT
ANY MORE PARAMETERS,

12:45.670 --> 12:47.490
NOTHING ELSE
IS STANDING OUT.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.280
OK. THAN KS.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.379
OH, UH, HEY,
HOLD ON A SEC.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.935
HEY. ANY BIG PLANS
TONIGHT?

12:55.990 --> 12:58.072
YEAH. I'M GONNA GO TO DINNER
WITH MY STEPBROTHERS

12:58.120 --> 12:59.200
ON THE EMBARCADERO.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.423
OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.337
LOOK, WE'RE ALL
THINKING OF YOU, OK?

13:04.390 --> 13:06.119
IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING...

13:06.170 --> 13:08.081
YEAH, I KNOW. THANK YOU.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.644
OK. OH, AND, OF COURSE,
WE WILL CALL YOU

13:10.700 --> 13:12.395
IF WE NEED MORE DIGGING.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.998
ALL RIGHT. MY SHOVEL
IS YOUR SHOVEL.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.779
BYE.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.487
SERIOUSLY? YOU GUYS
ARE PROVING MY THEORY

13:21.530 --> 13:24.613
THAT YOU CANNOT LIVE
WITHOUT ME.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.797
WHO IS THIS?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.059
NO, WE HAVE NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.625
DO NOT CALL
THIS NUMBER EVER AGAIN.

13:35.070 --> 13:37.857
WELL, WE CAN CROSS SERENA'S
EX OFF OUR SUSPECT LIST.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.629
HIS ALIBI CHECKS OUT.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.851
PRENTISS:
GUYS, MY GUT IS TELLING ME

13:40.900 --> 13:42.379
THIS IS NOT BIOTERRORISM

13:42.430 --> 13:43.761
BEING CONDUCTED
BY AN ORGANIZED GROUP.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.721
THE USE OF RAT POISON IS
JUST TOO LOW TECH FOR THEM.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.998
WELL, TERRORISTS OFTEN USE
LOW-TECH METHODS--

13:49.040 --> 13:50.769
I MEAN, LIKE DRIVING
TRUCKS INTO CROWDS.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.161
TRUE, BUT THEIR GOAL
IS TO TARGET

13:52.220 --> 13:54.950
AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY
CAN WITH ONE ACTION.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.389
PLUS, NO GROUP HAS
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THIS,

13:57.440 --> 14:00.523
AND WE ALL KNOW HOW
TERRORISTS LOVE TO BE
ON THE WORLD'S STAGE.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.094
WELL, THIS UNSUB'S
EITHER UNSOPHISTICATED

14:02.140 --> 14:03.789
OR HE KNOWS HE CAN BUY
RAT POISON ANYWHERE.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.319
EITHER WAY, SOMETHING
MUST HAVE TRIGGERED HIM

14:05.360 --> 14:06.873
TO START USING IT NOW.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.056
PRENTISS:
OK, UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT,

14:08.100 --> 14:09.442
LET'S LOOK AT WHY
HE'S USING IT.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.888
LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S EASY TO GET,

14:10.930 --> 14:12.716
AND IT CAN BE
CONTROLLED.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.489
ALVEZ: YOU CAN CONCEAL
IT IN A LOT OF THINGS,

14:14.540 --> 14:17.282
AND IT OFTEN TASTES
SWEET IN ORDER TO
ATTRACT THE RATS.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.582
SIMMONS: IT ALSO PROVIDES
A NON-PROXIMITY KILLING,

14:19.640 --> 14:21.119
WHICH MEANS HE COULD BE
SOCIALLY AWKWARD,

14:21.160 --> 14:22.889
UNABLE TO CONFRONT
HIS VICTIMS.

14:22.940 --> 14:23.941
YOU KNOW,
THE WINDOW OF DEATH

14:23.990 --> 14:25.764
MIGHT BE INFLUENCING
HIS CHOICE, TOO.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.549
I MEAN, THE LONGER
THAT IT TAKES
FOR HIS VICTIMS TO DIE,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.158
THE LONGER THEY SUFFER.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.815
THIS SADISTIC ELEMENT
LEANS TOWARDS THE UNSUB
BEING A MALE.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.428
YEAH, BUT WOULDN'T A SADIST
WANT TO WITNESS

14:33.480 --> 14:34.902
THE SUFFERING HE'S CAUSING?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.905
HE HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING
EXACTLY WHEN OR WHERE

14:36.960 --> 14:39.520
HIS VICTIMS FALL ILL,
SO HE'S PROBABLY JUST
GETTING OFF

14:39.570 --> 14:41.174
KNOWING THAT THEY ARE.

14:41.220 --> 14:43.563
AND BEING A SADIST,
HE'S NOT GONNA STOP
AFTER TWO VICTIMS.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.009
WITH EACH ONE, HE'S GAINING
CONFIDENCE, SATISFACTION.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.745
HIS EGO NEEDS TO BE FED,

14:47.790 --> 14:51.829
WHICH MEANS HE WILL
NEED TO INCREASE HIS
BODY COUNT AND SOON.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.142
HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M PAM CHAPMAN.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.360
AND I AM SO PLEASED
TO WELCOME YOU ALL
HERE TODAY.

14:58.410 --> 15:01.197
OUR MISSION AT THE ARLINGTON
BUSINESS LEAGUE IS SIMPLE:

15:01.240 --> 15:04.505
TO HELP YOUR BUSINESSES
SUCCEED AND THRIVE.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.939
TOGETHER WE CAN STRENGTHEN
NOT ONLY YOUR BOTTOM LINE

15:06.990 --> 15:08.764
BUT THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

15:08.820 --> 15:10.811
FOR ALL THOSE WHO LIVE
AND WORK IN OUR CITY.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.078
NOW, PLEASE, HELP YOURSELF
TO SOME FOOD,

15:13.120 --> 15:16.339
GET THOSE BUSINESS CARDS OUT,
AND HAVE FUN.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.737
KILLING WITH POISON
REQUIRES PREMEDITATION.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.008
IT USUALLY INVOLVES
SOME TYPE OF RUSE.

15:27.050 --> 15:29.393
WELL, THE UNSUB MUST HAVE
STALKED SERENA AND CLAYTON

15:29.450 --> 15:30.963
TO LEARN THEIR ROUTINES.

15:31.010 --> 15:33.740
BUT HOW DID HE PICK THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND WHY?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.882
HE MUST HAVE A KILL LIST
THAT MAKES SENSE TO HIM.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.660
BUT SINCE WE KNOW
THE VICTIMS WERE
SOMEHOW FED RAT POISON,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.369
WE NEED TO TRACK
EVERYTHING
THEY ATE OR DRANK

15:40.410 --> 15:41.843
IN THEIR LAST DAYS.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.846
WHERE THEY ATE IT,
WHO SERVED THEM.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.152
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.
LET'S GET ON IT.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.508
YEAH.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.893
WELL, IF YOU'RE HAVING
PERMIT PROBLEMS,

15:48.940 --> 15:50.726
YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK
TO BILL PACKER

15:50.770 --> 15:52.328
DOWN AT THE ZONING BOARD.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.938
TELL HIM I TOLD YOU
TO CALL.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.855
AAH!

15:58.780 --> 16:00.998
OH, MY GOD!

16:01.040 --> 16:02.905
OH, MY GOD!

16:04.920 --> 16:06.820
OHH!

16:12.750 --> 16:14.263
MS. CHAPMAN, WE'LL NEED
THE RSVP LIST

16:14.320 --> 16:18.222
AND THE NAMES
OF ALL YOUR STAFF
WORKING THE EVENT.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.362
OF COURSE. WALK-INS
ARE WELCOME, TOO.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.798
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO SIGN IN.

16:21.850 --> 16:25.399
DID YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE
ANYONE WHO LOOKED
SUSPICIOUS

16:25.460 --> 16:27.451
OR MAYBE DIDN'T BELONG?

16:27.500 --> 16:32.369
NO. NO, EVERYONE SEEMED
TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.978
WHERE DID THE FOOD
COME FROM?

16:34.030 --> 16:35.941
WE PICK A DIFFERENT
RESTAURANT EACH TIME

16:35.990 --> 16:37.981
TO SUPPORT
OUR LOCAL MERCHANTS.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.553
SIMMONS:
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT?

16:39.600 --> 16:43.252
IT WAS A NEW PLACE.
JUST OPENED.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.519
I WAS TALKING
TO THE OWNER...

16:46.570 --> 16:48.606
I'M SORRY.

16:48.650 --> 16:51.528
ROSSI: WE UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

16:55.530 --> 16:58.181
THE UNSUB WOULD HAVE
NEEDED ACCESS TO THE FOOD

16:58.230 --> 16:59.481
AND THE PUNCH.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.838
HE MIGHT WORK
FOR THE CATERER,

17:01.890 --> 17:04.017
OR HE COULD HAVE POSED
AS A SERVER.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.140
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
A WALK-IN

17:05.190 --> 17:06.885
OR ONE OF THE SURVIVING
ATTENDEES.

17:06.930 --> 17:10.411
IT'D BE RISKY BEHAVIOR
TO POISON OUT IN THE OPEN

17:10.460 --> 17:12.587
WITH SO MANY
POTENTIAL WITNESSES.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.414
HE COULDN'T HAVE PREDICT ED
WHICH ONE OF THE MEMBERS

17:14.460 --> 17:16.542
WAS GOING TO CONSUME
WHAT HE POISONED.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.500
SO HIS VICTIMS WENT
FROM TARGETED

17:18.550 --> 17:21.553
TO RANDOM OR VICTIMS
OF OPPORTUNITY.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.682
MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES...

17:23.730 --> 17:27.427
BUT WHAT THEY REPRESENT.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.951
THE UNSUB WE'RE LOOKING
FOR IS HOPING TO INFLICT

17:33.000 --> 17:35.468
AS MUCH FEAR AND DAMAGE
AS POSSIBLE

17:35.530 --> 17:37.521
IN ARLINGTON'S BUSINESS
COMMUNITY.

17:37.570 --> 17:39.618
TH ESE VICTIMS
AND THEIR BUSINESSES

17:39.660 --> 17:42.618
SYM BOLIZE WEALTH,
SUCCESS, GROWTH,
AND DEVELOPMENT--

17:42.670 --> 17:45.275
ALL THINGS HE MAY FEEL
ARE OUT OF HIS REACH.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.447
LEWIS: HE DERIVES PLEASURE
IN KNOWING THAT HIS VICTIMS

17:47.500 --> 17:49.582
ARE EXPERIENCING
A CRUEL AND PAINFUL DEATH

17:49.630 --> 17:52.269
AND THAT HIS CRIMES MAY
CREATE WIDESPREAD PANIC.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.457
WE CALL THIS RIPPLE
EFFECT TERRORISM,

17:54.500 --> 17:57.060
AND EXAMPLES OF IT
WOULD BE THE TYLENOL
TAMPERING CASE

17:57.110 --> 17:58.452
IN THE EIGHTIES

17:58.510 --> 18:00.762
OR THE ANTHRAX-LACED
LETTERS POST 9/11.

18:00.810 --> 18:03.074
JJ: THOSE WHO POISON TEND
TO BE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL,

18:03.120 --> 18:06.465
BOTTLING UP INSIDE WHAT
THEY DEEM TO BE INJUSTICES.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.943
THEY USE THESE
IMAGINED SLIGHTS

18:09.000 --> 18:11.423
AS JUSTIFICATION
TO HARM THEIR VICTIMS.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.643
LACKING EMPATHY WITH
AN EXAGGERATED SENSE
OF ENTITLEMENT,

18:14.700 --> 18:16.861
A POISONER CARES ONLY
ABOUT THEIR OWN WANTS
OR NEEDS,

18:16.920 --> 18:18.729
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
THE INDIFFERENT

18:18.790 --> 18:20.519
AND HEARTLESS NATURE
OF THESE CRIMES.

18:20.570 --> 18:23.653
POISONERS BELIEVE
THEIR CALCULATED PLANS,
THEIR CLEVERNESS

18:23.710 --> 18:25.268
ALLOW THEM TO KILL
AND WALK AWAY.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.129
SO FAR, HE'S BEEN
ABLE TO DO THAT.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.829
ALVEZ: THE UNSUB USES
FOOD AS A METHOD

18:29.890 --> 18:31.699
TO MASK THE RAT POISONING.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.148
HE MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE
DOING THIS

18:33.190 --> 18:35.146
BECAUSE HE WORKS
IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.145
THERE'S NO INDICATION
HE'LL STOP,

18:37.200 --> 18:39.634
AND HIS NEXT TARGET
COULD BE EVEN LARGER.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.195
A FOOD FESTIVAL,
A SUPERMARKET,
A SCHOOL CAFETERIA.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.150
JJ: WE'LL BE ISSUING
A RELEASE TO THE MEDIA

18:45.210 --> 18:46.859
URGING ALL EATERIES
AND BARS

18:46.900 --> 18:48.458
TO CLOSELY MONITOR
THEIR FOOD.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.114
CUSTOMERS WILL BE REMINDED

18:50.170 --> 18:52.161
NOT TO LEAVE THEIR FOOD
OR DRINKS UNATTENDED

18:52.210 --> 18:54.553
OR CONSUME ANYTHING
THEY'RE UNSURE ABOUT.

18:54.610 --> 18:57.170
AND THE ANTIDOTE TO
RAT POISON IS PHYTONADIONE,

18:57.220 --> 18:58.824
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE
ADMINISTERED IMMEDIATELY

18:58.870 --> 19:00.781
BY MEDICAL PERSONNEL.

19:00.830 --> 19:02.695
PRENTISS: AS A PRECAUTIONARY
MEASURE, ALL AREA HOSPITALS

19:02.750 --> 19:06.527
CLINICS, AND EMTs
SHOULD MAKE SURE TO HAVE
AMPLE SUPPLIES ON HAND.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.616
THANK YOU, ALL.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.733
WOMAN:
BYE, PENELOPE.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.297
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:14.340 --> 20:16.422
NOTHING.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.290
UH, NOTHING, CARLOS.
GO BACK TO BED.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.575
YES?

20:36.620 --> 20:38.747
ARE YOU PENELOPE GARCIA?

20:38.800 --> 20:40.404
COLETTE?

20:40.450 --> 20:43.237
MIND IF I SIT?

20:43.280 --> 20:45.794
I WAS SURPRISED
YOU CALLED BACK
AND WANTED TO MEET.

20:45.850 --> 20:49.320
YOU SAID WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

20:49.370 --> 20:50.928
YEAH, I DID.

20:50.980 --> 20:54.279
AND THEN I CALLED
SAINT PAUL'S CEMETERY,

20:54.340 --> 20:56.376
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT
YOU'VE BEEN SENDING FLOWERS

20:56.420 --> 20:58.638
TO MY PARENTS' GRAVE
ALL THESE YEARS.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.727
IT'S NOT FROM ME.
THEY'RE FROM
MY BROTHER JESSE.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.997
WHAT?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.258
HE CAN'T DO IT,
SO I HANDLE IT FOR HIM.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.906
HE PAYS FOR THEM
WITH THE MONEY
HE EARNS IN PRISON.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.269
WHY IS HE DOING THAT?

21:11.310 --> 21:12.914
JESSE'S SORRY
FOR WHAT HE DID.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.655
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO
KILL YOUR PARENTS.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.780
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

21:15.830 --> 21:18.708
NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT
AN ACCIDENT IS.

21:18.750 --> 21:22.402
HE CHOSE TO DRINK,
AND THEN HE CHOSE TO DRIVE,

21:22.450 --> 21:26.409
AND HE CHANGED
MY LIFE FOREVER.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.499
HE WAS JUST A KID.
HE WAS ONLY 18.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.623
YEAH, I WAS ONLY 18, TOO.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.979
DIDN'T YOU EVER
DO ANYTHING STUPID

21:36.030 --> 21:37.725
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?

21:37.770 --> 21:40.682
LIKE MAKE A BAD DECISION
OR TAKE A DUMB RISK

21:40.730 --> 21:43.119
THAT YOU
LATER REGRETTED?

21:43.170 --> 21:47.334
ALL I ASK IS THAT
YOU TALK TO JESSE

21:47.390 --> 21:49.858
BEFORE YOU PASS
JUDGMENT.

21:49.910 --> 21:53.698
PLEASE, CAN YOU FIND
IT IN YOUR HEART
TO FORGIVE HIM?

21:53.740 --> 21:56.914
WON'T YOU GIVE JESSE
A CHANCE TO START
HIS LIFE AGAIN?

21:59.100 --> 22:02.831
WHEN ARE MY PARENTS
GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START THEIR LIVES AGAIN?

22:09.890 --> 22:12.404
SO EVERYONE CONNECTED
TO THE BUSINESS LEAGUE
EVENT CHECKS OUT.

22:12.460 --> 22:15.679
WE ARE BACK IN THE SHALLOW
END OF OUR SUSPECT POOL,

22:15.720 --> 22:17.199
SO WHY ATTACK
LOCAL BUSINESSES?

22:17.240 --> 22:18.889
WELL, 30% OF ALL
BUSINESSES FAIL

22:18.940 --> 22:20.419
WITHIN THE FIRST
TWO YEARS,

22:20.460 --> 22:22.724
AND MAYBE THE UNSUB
WAS STRUGGLING
TO STAY AFLOAT

22:22.770 --> 22:24.590
OR HAD A NEW BUSINESS
THAT WENT BELLY UP.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.813
ON THE FLIPSIDE,
HE COULD HAVE
AN OLDER BUSINESS,

22:26.860 --> 22:28.509
ONE THAT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR YEARS.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.380
HE MAY FEEL
HE'S BEING PUSHED OUT

22:30.430 --> 22:32.034
BY THE NEW KIDS
ON THE BLOCK.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.696
WELL, KILLING HIS RIVALS
MAY BE A MISGUIDED
ATTEMPT AT REVENGE.

22:34.740 --> 22:37.789
WORKING IN A COMMERCIAL
LOAN DEPARTMENT,

22:37.830 --> 22:40.082
PART OF SERENA LOGAN'S JOB

22:40.140 --> 22:43.871
WOULD BE TO FIND AND ATTRACT
NEW BUSINESSES TO THE AREA.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.388
YEAH. WHAT IF THE UNSUB
APPLIED FOR A NEW LOAN

22:46.450 --> 22:48.577
OR TRIED TO REFINANCE
AN EXISTING ONE,

22:48.620 --> 22:49.928
AND SERENA TURNED DOWN
HIS APPLICATION?

22:49.970 --> 22:51.278
SIMMONS:
HIS ANGER AT BEING DENIED

22:51.320 --> 22:52.628
COULD BE WHY HE TARGETED HER

22:52.670 --> 22:54.922
AND OTHER BUSINESS
LEAGUE MEMBERS.

22:54.980 --> 22:56.231
I'LL HEAD TO SERENA'S BANK.
I'LL TALK TO HER MANAGER,

22:56.280 --> 22:57.838
SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

22:57.890 --> 22:59.152
WE'LL NEED A LIST
OF HER CLIENTS

22:59.200 --> 23:01.236
AND ALL THE LOANS
SHE APPROVED OR REJECT ED

23:01.290 --> 23:03.724
OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.418
WHAT IS IT, DAVE?

23:07.470 --> 23:11.031
THE LOAN ANGLE COULD EXPLAIN
WHY SERENA WAS KILLED,

23:11.080 --> 23:13.594
BUT THERE'S STILL THE
QUESTION OF CLAYTON OSBORNE.

23:13.650 --> 23:16.426
YEAH. HOW DOES
AN ANALYST IN FOREIGN
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE

23:16.480 --> 23:17.959
FIT INTO ALL THIS?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.217
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GUY

23:19.260 --> 23:20.431
THAT WE'RE MISSING.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.959
IN THE MEANTIME,
THE RIPPLE EFFECT

23:22.000 --> 23:24.480
WILL DICTATE
THE UNSUB'S NEXT MOVE.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.657
HE'LL WANT TO CREATE
MORE PANIC

23:26.700 --> 23:28.304
BY DROPPING MORE BODIES.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.056
THIS UNSUB'S GOING AFTER
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.352
SO WHO'S NEXT?

23:57.170 --> 24:00.424
MAN: WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.349
WOMAN: THEY BOTH WORKED SO HARD.

24:05.660 --> 24:09.130
SECOND WOMAN: THAT PLACE
KILLED THEM, KILLED THEM BOTH.

25:01.020 --> 25:04.444
OH, I MISS THE BREAKFAST
BURRITO AT JENKIN'S.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.979
I COULD MARRY THAT BURRITO.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.932
YEAH, IT'S ONE OF
THE BEST.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.936
YOU OK?

25:10.980 --> 25:13.198
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO IT.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.461
I CAN'T READ
MY IMPACT STATEMENT.

25:17.510 --> 25:19.239
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO IT.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.074
ME

25:21.120 --> 25:22.382
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

25:22.430 --> 25:23.590
WHEN I SEE JESSE WILSON

25:23.650 --> 25:25.470
JUST SITTING A FEW FEET
AWAY FROM ME.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.909
WHY DOESN'T EDDIE DO IT,
OR MANNY OR RAFE?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.439
THEY'RE NOT COMING.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.914
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.349
I DON'T KNOW.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.561
I'M A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE FBI.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.780
THE PAROLE BOARD
WILL THINK MY WORDS

25:37.840 --> 25:39.319
HOLD A LOT OF WEIGHT.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.134
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT,
ISN'T IT?

25:41.190 --> 25:44.830
PLEASE. THEY'RE GONNA
SOUND SO MUCH BETTER
COMING FROM YOU,

25:44.890 --> 25:47.529
AND I'M JUST NOT GOOD
AT TALKING
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.360
OK.

25:51.410 --> 25:54.152
SHOW ME WHAT
YOU WERE GONNA SAY.
I'LL PRACTICE.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.679
THANK YOU.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.022
YOU KNOW,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

25:59.070 --> 26:01.891
I STILL FIND MYSELF
TURNING IT OVER IN MY HEAD.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.908
WHAT WERE OUR PARENTS
DOING OUT SO LATE
THAT NIGHT, ANYWAY?

26:04.950 --> 26:06.110
WHERE WERE THEY GOING?

26:14.350 --> 26:16.341
IT WASN'T
EVEN MY FAULT.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.130
THE CAR CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE.

26:19.180 --> 26:21.398
THAT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?

26:32.930 --> 26:34.534
I GOTTA GO.

26:34.590 --> 26:35.887
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.544
OK, SURE. WHERE YOU GOING?
I'LL TAKE YOU.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.546
NO, THAT'S OK.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

26:39.590 --> 26:40.636
I LOVE YOU.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.193
I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.150
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.274
I'M PENELOPE GARCIA.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.015
JESSE.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.016
THAT NIGHT OUTSIDE
THE POLICE STATION,

27:17.070 --> 27:22.098
I WAS DRUNK,
BUT I REMEMBER YOU.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.934
YOUR SISTER CALLED ME.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.720
I TOLD COLETTE
NOT TO.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.591
SHE ASKED YOU TO
COME, DIDN'T SHE?

27:29.640 --> 27:31.551
NO. I CAME HERE
BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.329
BECAUSE I WANT
TO TELL YOU TO YOUR FACE

27:33.390 --> 27:34.732
I'M GOING TO YOUR
HEARING TODAY

27:34.780 --> 27:35.860
AND I'M TELLING THEM
YOU NEED TO STAY IN PRISON

27:35.910 --> 27:37.559
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID,

27:37.610 --> 27:40.249
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU TOOK
FROM MY FAMILY.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.437
I KNOW.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.823
NO. NO,
YOU DON'T KNOW.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.259
YOU DON'T--YOU HAVE ZERO
CLUE ABOUT WHAT YOU DID.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.959
THERE IS A HOLE
INSIDE OF ME

27:50.010 --> 27:52.535
THAT NOTHING CAN EVER FILL
BECAUSE OF THAT NIGHT,

27:52.580 --> 27:54.707
AND YOU'VE BEEN LEAVING
FLOWERS ON MY PARENTS' GRAVE.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.751
THAT IS THE GRAVE
YOU PUT THEM IN.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.665
LIKE ANYTHING YOU COULD DO

27:58.720 --> 28:00.403
COULD MAKE ANY OF THIS
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.973
Y--YOU CAN'T.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.716
NO.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.897
I CAN NEVER MAKE UP
FOR WHAT I DID.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.724
I SUPPOSE IT'S MY GUILT
THAT MAKES ME SEND THEM.

28:12.770 --> 28:16.592
I MADE A MISTAKE THAT NIGHT
BECAUSE I WAS STUPID.

28:16.650 --> 28:20.029
EVERYBODY MAKES
MISTAKES, BUT...

28:20.080 --> 28:21.866
NOT LIKE THAT.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.049
I DESERVE TO BE
WHERE I AM,

28:24.090 --> 28:27.560
AND THIS PLACE
MAKES IT HARD
TO FORGET THAT.

28:27.610 --> 28:30.431
PRISON BARS ARE
THE LAST THING I SEE

28:30.490 --> 28:31.741
BEFORE I CLOSE
MY EYES AT NIGHT

28:31.790 --> 28:34.964
AND THE FIRST THING
I SEE WHEN I OPEN THEM.

28:35.010 --> 28:37.274
SO THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU SAY

28:37.320 --> 28:38.799
PRISON HAS MADE YOU
A BETTER MAN

28:38.840 --> 28:41.365
AND ALL YOU NEED
IS A CHANCE TO PROVE IT?

28:41.410 --> 28:45.756
NO. THE ONLY THING
I WANT IS A CHANCE TO
GO BACK TO THAT NIGHT,

28:45.810 --> 28:47.971
TO MAKE A BETTER CHOICE.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.850
WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.421
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.381
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

29:00.430 --> 29:01.818
IT'S MY FAULT.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.828
AND I KNOW THAT
THIS DOESN'T BRING
YOUR PARENTS BACK,

29:04.870 --> 29:08.306
AND IT PROBABLY
WON'T GIVE YOU
ANY COMFORT, BUT...

29:10.220 --> 29:13.178
I'M TRULY SORRY.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.268
P.A.: ATTENTION, PLEASE.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.834
VISITING HOURS ARE NOW OVER.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.838
INMATES, RETURN TO YOUR CELLS.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.625
I WON'T SEND
THE FLOWERS ANYMORE.

29:28.370 --> 29:30.361
OK, SO THESE ARE ALL
THE BUSINESS LOAN
APPLICATIONS

29:30.420 --> 29:32.411
THAT SERENA HANDLED
OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.769
AND THOSE ARE
THE 90 LOANS
SHE APPROVED,

29:34.810 --> 29:36.596
AND THESE ARE THE 30
APPLICATIONS SHE REJECT ED.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.722
SIMMONS: WELL, DID THE BANK
SEND ELECTRONIC FILES, TOO?

29:38.770 --> 29:40.635
YEAH. I THOUGHT ABOUT
CALLING GARCIA,

29:40.690 --> 29:42.681
BUT I KNOW THAT
SHE'S GOT A BIG DAY TODAY

29:42.730 --> 29:44.129
WITH THE PAROLE HEARING.

29:44.170 --> 29:46.422
WELL, IT MAY TAKE THE THREE
OF US TO EQUAL ONE GARCIA,

29:46.480 --> 29:50.086
BUT LET'S DO OUR OWN
DIGITAL DIG.

29:50.130 --> 29:53.122
WELL, I'M NOT SEEING
ANY RESTAURANTS,
DINERS, OR CAFES

29:53.180 --> 29:55.307
IN THE LOAN APPLICATIONS
DENIED BY SERENA.

29:55.350 --> 29:56.829
SO, NOW WHAT?

29:56.880 --> 30:00.099
JJ: OK, UH, WELL, ROSSI
THOUGHT THAT AN OLDER,

30:00.140 --> 30:01.698
ESTABLISHED PLACE
MIGHT FEEL LIKE THEY
WERE BEING PUSHED OUT

30:01.750 --> 30:03.354
BY NEWCOMERS.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.537
YEAH. AN OLDER PLACE
MIGHT HAVE LOST ITS LEASE

30:05.580 --> 30:06.888
OR BEEN FORECLOSED ON,

30:06.930 --> 30:08.704
BUT SERENA DIDN'T
HANDLE FORECLOSURES.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.274
WELL, WE CAN TRY SEARCHING
FOR BUSINESS FORECLOSURES

30:11.330 --> 30:13.890
IN ARLINGTON
OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.416
OK, I'VE GOT
29 FORECLOSURES.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.802
ANY RESTAURANTS?

30:20.860 --> 30:23.374
UH...

30:23.430 --> 30:25.330
YEAH. 12.

30:25.380 --> 30:28.816
OK, AND ONE
WAS FORECLOSED ON

30:28.870 --> 30:30.861
AFTER NEARLY 30 YEARS
IN BUSINESS.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.730
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A MOM
AND POP-TYPE RESTAURANT

30:32.780 --> 30:34.566
CALLED HENSHAW'S.

30:36.740 --> 30:38.879
SIMMONS: HARRISON
AND MAUREEN HENSHAW
WERE THE OWNERS.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.434
THEIR SON MARK
WORKED THERE AS WELL.

30:41.490 --> 30:43.788
MOM AND DAD SEEMED LIKE
GOOD PEOPLE.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.353
REALLY CARED ABOUT
THEIR CUSTOMERS,

30:45.400 --> 30:46.742
AND THEY ALWAYS HAD
A HOT MEAL

30:46.800 --> 30:48.358
FOR ANYONE
DOWN ON THEIR LUCK.

30:48.410 --> 30:51.447
THEY EVEN PERSONALLY
DELIVERED SOUP
TO SICK PATRONS.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.718
SIMMONS: WHERE ARE
THE HENSHAWS NOW?

30:53.760 --> 30:57.844
OK, MOM, MAUREEN, DIED.
SHE HAD A STROKE LAST YEAR,

30:57.890 --> 31:01.155
AND TWO WEEKS AGO,
DAD SUFFERED
A FATAL HEART ATTACK.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.020
ALVEZ: NOW, MARK'S HAND
WAS BADLY BURNED

31:03.070 --> 31:04.947
IN A KITCHEN ACCIDENT
AT THE RESTAURANT.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.946
HENSHAW'S RESTAURANT
MAY BE OUT OF BUSINESS,

31:06.990 --> 31:08.810
BUT MARK'S STILL BUYING
RAT POISON.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.725
THE FORECLOSURE
ON THE FAMILY BUSINESS

31:10.780 --> 31:11.997
AND HIS FATHER'S
RECENT DEATH,

31:12.040 --> 31:13.029
I MEAN, THAT MUST HAVE
TRIGGERED THE KILLINGS.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.866
JJ: AND MARK PROBABLY
FELT BETRAYED

31:14.910 --> 31:16.605
WHEN CUSTOMERS STOPPED
GOING TO HIS PARENTS'
RESTAURANT

31:16.650 --> 31:18.606
AND STARTED GOING
TO THE NEW PLACES IN TOWN.

31:18.650 --> 31:22.654
IS IT POSSIBLE
CLAYTON OSBORNE
ATE AT HENSHAW'S?

31:22.700 --> 31:24.042
UH...

31:24.090 --> 31:25.830
HE DID.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.394
HE WROTE A NEGATIVE REVIEW
THAT WENT VIRAL.

31:28.450 --> 31:30.611
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT AN ADDRESS
FOR MARK HENSHAW.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.205
FBI!

32:02.090 --> 32:03.864
CLEAR.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.824
CLEAR.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.915
CLEAR.

32:12.010 --> 32:14.137
GUYS, I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.534
THE HOUSE IS CLEAR.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.069
ALVEZ: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.712
HE'S PLANNING
SOMETHING BIG.

32:28.770 --> 32:31.022
THIS COULD BE
HIS ENDGAME.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.258
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LISTEN UP!

32:46.310 --> 32:48.471
I DON'T KNOW ALL
YOUR NAMES AND FACES,

32:48.530 --> 32:49.474
BUT I'LL LEARN 'EM.

32:49.530 --> 32:51.043
WE GOT A LOT OF HUNGRY FOLKS

32:51.090 --> 32:52.261
ABOUT TO COME THROUGH
THOSE DOORS,

32:52.310 --> 32:55.052
SO I NEED YOU TO BRING
YOUR A-GAME TODAY.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.443
AND, REMEMBER,
A HAPPY CUSTOMER

32:57.490 --> 32:59.094
IS A RETURNING CUSTOMER.

32:59.150 --> 33:00.492
LET'S GO!

33:17.860 --> 33:18.849
THERE HAVE GOT TO BE
THOUSANDS OF PLACES

33:18.900 --> 33:21.039
TO EAT IN ARLINGTON,
SO WHICH ONE

33:21.080 --> 33:22.422
IS MARK HENSHAW
PLANNING TO TARGET?

33:22.470 --> 33:24.552
HENSHAW'S RESTAURANT
WAS IN A PRIME LOCATION.

33:24.610 --> 33:26.555
WHAT'S THERE NOW?

33:28.610 --> 33:30.430
OK, A NEW RESTAURANT,

33:30.480 --> 33:31.526
AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PLACE

33:31.570 --> 33:33.470
CALLED
THE GOOD EATIN' BUFFET.

33:33.530 --> 33:35.998
WAIT A MINUTE.
I REMEMBER THAT NAME.

33:36.050 --> 33:39.315
SERENA LOGAN APPROVED
THEIR NEW BUSINESS LOAN.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.487
ALL RIGHT.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.531
THE HENSHAWS' ORIGINAL
SPACE WAS EXPANDED.

33:43.580 --> 33:47.050
IT NOW SEATS 200,
AND THE GRAND OPENING
IS TODAY AT NOON.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.101
THAT'S IN 10 MINUTES.

33:49.150 --> 33:52.415
WE NEED TO GET MEDICAL
PERSONNEL THERE RIGHT NOW.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.203
HEY. THEY NEED YOU OVER
AT THE DESSERT STATION.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.502
BUT I WAS TOLD
TO DO SALADS.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.425
YOU WANT TO ASK
THE BOSS?

34:04.950 --> 34:08.033
NO. THAT'S OK.

34:31.930 --> 34:35.229
PRENTISS: JJ, MATT, TAKE
THE BACK. ALVEZ, YOU'RE WITH US.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.641
IT HELPS KEEP THE FOOD FRESH.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.616
MAN: MAN, I LOVE
THIS PLACE.

35:03.660 --> 35:07.391
THE STUFF LOOKS GOOD, RIGHT?

35:07.450 --> 35:10.271
ROSSI: FBI! EVERYONE STOP
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

35:10.320 --> 35:12.311
WE NEED YOU ALL TO GO
OUTSIDE WITH US RIGHT NOW!

35:12.370 --> 35:14.099
MANAGER: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:14.150 --> 35:15.879
PRENTISS: WE NEED TO SHUT
EVERYTHING DOWN.
THE FOOD'S BEEN POISONED.

35:15.930 --> 35:17.545
MAN: POISONED?!
LUKE, THERE.

35:27.900 --> 35:30.039
[INDISTINCT CHATTER
IN NEXT ROOM]

35:34.480 --> 35:37.608
ALVEZ: MARK HENSHAW,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

35:38.910 --> 35:41.526
COMMISSIONER:
MS. GARCIA, WE UNDERSTAND

35:41.570 --> 35:43.606
YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE
A STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.525
GO GET 'EM, SIS.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.662
HELLO. MY NAME
IS PENELOPE GARCIA.

35:55.710 --> 35:57.758
I'M A TECHNICAL ANALYST
AT THE FBI.

35:57.800 --> 36:01.019
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME
THE OPPORTUNITY

36:01.070 --> 36:03.026
TO SPEAK IN FRONT
OF YOU TODAY.

36:03.070 --> 36:06.198
I WANT THE FULL IMPACT
OF JESSE WILSON'S CRIME

36:06.250 --> 36:09.469
TO BE BROUGHT
TO YOUR ATTENTION.

36:09.510 --> 36:12.559
WHEN I WAS 18,
MY MOTHER AND STEPFATHER,

36:12.600 --> 36:14.818
BARBARA AND EMILIO GARCIA,

36:14.860 --> 36:18.296
WERE KILLED BY MR. WILSON'S

36:18.350 --> 36:22.309
CARELESS AND SELFISH DEEDS.

36:22.350 --> 36:25.695
IT WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY FAMILY'S LIFE.

36:27.570 --> 36:30.038
IT WAS THE WORST DAY

36:30.100 --> 36:31.613
OF MY LIFE.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.610
AND WE WILL NEVER
STOP MISSING THEM.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.629
BUT...

36:42.670 --> 36:45.719
MOURNING THE LIVES
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

36:45.760 --> 36:47.716
WON'T BRING THEM BACK.

36:47.770 --> 36:51.979
AND NEITHER WILL KEEPING
JESSE WILSON BEHIND BARS.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.239
CARLOS: PENELOPE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:56.300 --> 36:58.643
COMMISSIONER: QUIET, PLEASE,
OR YOU'LL BE REMOVED.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.083
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,

37:04.130 --> 37:07.566
I'VE HAD THIS CLOUD OF...

37:07.610 --> 37:11.614
RAGE AND PAIN AND GUILT,

37:11.660 --> 37:13.218
AND I COULDN'T BEAR IT,

37:13.270 --> 37:16.137
AND I NEEDED A PLACE
TO FOCUS IT,

37:16.190 --> 37:19.136
AND I FOCUSED
THAT WHOLE CLOUD ON JESSE.

37:19.190 --> 37:23.490
I NEEDED TO DEMONIZE YOU.

37:23.540 --> 37:28.193
I'M SO SCARED TO SEE YOU
AS A REAL PERSON,

37:28.240 --> 37:31.061
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT
THE MONSTER IN PRISON,

37:31.110 --> 37:33.635
THEN WHO DO I HAVE TO BLAME?

37:37.950 --> 37:41.590
MY PARENTS TAUGHT US
THAT A BIG PART OF LOVE

37:41.650 --> 37:43.550
IS FORGIVENESS.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.081
JESSE HAS TOLD ME HE'S SORRY
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE,

37:47.130 --> 37:48.779
AND I DO BELIEVE HIM.

37:52.350 --> 37:55.046
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE PAST.

37:56.180 --> 37:59.911
BUT MOVING ON
IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

37:59.970 --> 38:02.666
IT IS, AND...

38:04.060 --> 38:09.236
AND THAT'S WHY I AM
HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY,

38:09.280 --> 38:12.716
ASKING THAT THE BOARD
FORGIVE JESSE,

38:12.760 --> 38:16.582
AS I HAVE,
AND GRANT HIM PAROLE.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.596
THANK YOU.

38:18.640 --> 38:23.589
WE'LL NOW RECESS
FOR DELIBERATION.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.722
CARLOS.

38:25.780 --> 38:26.815
CARLOS.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.646
THANK YOU.

38:30.650 --> 38:33.517
CARLOS, WAIT.

38:33.570 --> 38:35.913
CARLOS, YOU KNOW
THIS IS WHAT MOM AND DAD
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.302
NO!

38:37.350 --> 38:40.046
YES.
NO!

38:40.100 --> 38:43.263
OK, LOOK, THAT NIGHT...

38:43.320 --> 38:46.403
THE REASON WHY THEY
WERE OUT THAT NIGHT...

38:46.450 --> 38:49.146
DRIVING SO LATE...

38:49.190 --> 38:52.057
IS BECAUSE OF ME.

38:52.110 --> 38:53.839
I MISSED MY CURFEW.

38:53.890 --> 38:55.755
THEY WENT OUT LOOKING.

38:55.810 --> 38:59.280
THEY LEFT ME A NOTE, BUT...

38:59.330 --> 39:01.457
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

39:01.510 --> 39:03.899
IF IT WASN'T
FOR MY BAD CHOICES.

39:06.770 --> 39:09.512
CARLOS, TALK TO ME.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.678
TALK TO YOU? I CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.873
ALVEZ: DOES ANYONE KNOW
HOW GARCIA MADE OUT

39:22.920 --> 39:24.399
AT THE PAROLE BOARD HEARING.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.658
YEAH. SHE CALLED.
IT SEEMS SHE
PETITIONED THE BOARD

39:26.710 --> 39:28.189
TO RELEASE JESSE WILSON.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.743
SIMMONS: I WONDER WHAT
CHANGED HER MIND.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.188
FORGIVENESS.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.492
ROSSI: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE PENELOPE

39:32.540 --> 39:33.757
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.404
JJ: ABSOLUTELY.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.882
SO, WE'LL SEE HER TOMORROW.

39:36.930 --> 39:39.581
PRENTISS:
NO. SHE ASKED
FOR ANOTHER DAY.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.939
SHE SAID THERE
WAS SOMETHING SHE
NEEDED TO DO.

39:54.210 --> 39:56.906
HI, MOM.

39:56.950 --> 40:00.249
HI, POP.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.870
MOM, I BROUGHT
YOUR FAVORITE FLOWERS.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.524
I'M SURE YOU'RE BOTH WONDERING

40:04.570 --> 40:07.004
WHY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME
IN A WHILE.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.746
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?
I'VE NEVER COME HERE
TO VISIT YOU.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.405
THE NIGHT THAT YOU DIED,

40:15.450 --> 40:17.759
I SAW THAT NOTE
YOU LEFT ME,

40:17.800 --> 40:21.804
AND I KNEW THAT YOU
WERE DISAPPOINTED IN ME,

40:21.850 --> 40:23.932
AND I KNEW
I WAS IN REALLY BIG TROUBLE.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.584
AND I...

40:26.850 --> 40:29.410
I WISHED THAT
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.983
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.553
AND IT WAS LIKE
THAT AWFUL WISH

40:40.610 --> 40:42.953
MADE IT HAPPEN.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.436
AND I AM SO ASHAMED
THAT I DID THAT.

40:50.530 --> 40:54.318
I DO FEEL LIKE
I LIVE MY LIFE IN A WAY NOW

40:54.360 --> 40:58.922
THAT YOU WOULD BE
REALLY PROUD OF ME.

40:58.970 --> 41:02.974
I HOPE YOU'RE REALLY
PROUD OF ME.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.580
I MADE A CHOICE YESTERDAY

41:05.630 --> 41:09.191
THAT I THINK
WAS REALLY GOOD.

41:09.240 --> 41:14.894
BUT I MESSED THINGS UP
PRETTY BAD WITH CARLOS.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.420
BUT IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE,
AND, UM...

41:18.470 --> 41:20.426
AND I KNOW HOW
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

41:20.470 --> 41:21.425
I'M GOOD AT MAKING
THINGS BETTER.

41:21.470 --> 41:23.165
I JUST NEED A LITTLE TIME.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.861
I'LL MAKE THINGS
BETTER WITH HIM.

41:25.910 --> 41:29.823
I THOUGHT SINCE
IT WAS SUCH A GLORIOUS DAY

41:29.870 --> 41:31.952
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PICNIC.

41:34.180 --> 41:38.002
I'M THINKING ABOUT DOING
A TECHNOLOGY FAST...

41:38.060 --> 41:39.834
GARCIA, VOICE-OVER:
"FORGIVENESS IS THE FRAGRANCE

41:39.880 --> 41:41.575
