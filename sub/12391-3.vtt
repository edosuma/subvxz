WEBVTT

00:04.609 --> 00:06.980
Look I'm telling you,
my son Shawn did not

00:06.985 --> 00:08.500
have a permission to go
on that field trip.

00:08.730 --> 00:12.503
Well, he did turn in his
permission slip signed by you.

00:13.242 --> 00:15.399
Signature's a forgery.
It's a fake.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.397
Well, that's a little dramatic,
don't you think, Mr. Spencer?

00:19.425 --> 00:22.021
Look, this form is a counterfeit.
These are serious charges.

00:22.032 --> 00:23.436
And my son needs to be punished.

00:23.491 --> 00:29.115
Mr. Spencer... all three are permission
slips also signed by you.

00:30.869 --> 00:31.869
Yes.

00:32.822 --> 00:33.838
Yes.

00:33.897 --> 00:37.597
- Yes, those... those are my signatures.
- Well, you see, then?

00:38.014 --> 00:40.854
I'd be hard-pressed to believe
that a child of Shawn's age

00:40.892 --> 00:42.959
could be capable
of such detailed forgery.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.548
Well, you don't know my son.

00:44.846 --> 00:47.642
No offense, but you are the vice
principal of a middle school,

00:47.725 --> 00:49.121
not a handwriting expert.

00:49.165 --> 00:50.966
That testimony's not gonna
hold up in court.

00:51.053 --> 00:55.296
Well, we're not talking court.
Are we?

00:56.871 --> 00:59.633
You know, 'cause if we were,
you should know that I did take

00:59.656 --> 01:02.341
a handwriting personality course
at the Learning Annex last summer.

01:02.459 --> 01:06.547
And I can tell by the way you, uh,
turn your N humps

01:06.701 --> 01:10.137
that you have a very open
and childlike kindness about you.

01:12.805 --> 01:13.822
I could be off on that.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.502
You know, it... it was
a one-night seminar.

01:15.601 --> 01:18.358
Okay... now, as a sergeant
with the Santa Barbara

01:18.413 --> 01:20.513
Police Department, let me tell you
what I know.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.791
See the pen lift on the R there?

01:23.880 --> 01:27.089
The bleed mark... that shows
hesitation, as if thinking, "Gee.

01:27.377 --> 01:29.366
How do I form that next letter?"

01:29.421 --> 01:31.515
Now I don't know about you,
but I don't have to think

01:31.548 --> 01:35.327
about how to sign my own damn name...
So you're wrong.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.166
Really?
I don't know, Dad.

01:38.244 --> 01:42.435
I think Mr. Petlic has a point.
They look pretty identical to me.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.572
Hey, check it out.
There's Lassiter.

01:53.661 --> 01:58.649
Make a loop like a bunny's ear, wrap
it around, careful as you steer...

02:00.113 --> 02:02.146
That's a good boy, Lassie.

02:03.547 --> 02:05.790
Wait a minute. You're not Lassie.

02:05.879 --> 02:08.144
Well, I don't know what a Lassie is,
but I'm not it.

02:08.210 --> 02:10.044
I'm Special Agent Lars Ewing
with the FTD.

02:10.098 --> 02:13.215
- You're a special florist?
- Federal Treasury Department.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.374
We have a department that deals
exclusively with treasures?

02:15.396 --> 02:17.782
If you'll excuse me, I have
a meeting in an...

02:17.959 --> 02:19.803
Interim Chief Vick's office.

02:19.858 --> 02:22.411
That's where our meeting is!
This is very exciting.

02:22.544 --> 02:23.770
I feel nervous.

02:24.030 --> 02:24.925
Is that what you're wearing?

02:24.980 --> 02:27.565
This goes against every federal bone
in my body, but who are you guys?

02:27.626 --> 02:29.758
I'm not familiar with
the federal bone.

02:29.825 --> 02:31.648
Is that connected to
the hip bone or the knee bone?

02:31.725 --> 02:33.415
Well, I can tell you what the
knee bone is gonna connect with

02:33.437 --> 02:35.559
- if you don't get out of my way.
- I'm gonna guess.

02:35.691 --> 02:36.698
Not the funny bone?

02:41.165 --> 02:43.618
- This meeting is bigger than we thought.
- Yeah.

02:50.361 --> 02:53.073
Get us some seats close to the desk,
but not on the side.

02:53.178 --> 02:55.620
I'll catch up in a second.

03:03.847 --> 03:05.559
Waiting for Godot?

03:06.847 --> 03:07.857
Guffman.

03:09.674 --> 03:11.290
Waiting to exhale?

03:12.505 --> 03:14.144
I'm not waiting to exhale.

03:14.689 --> 03:16.810
- Shawn Spencer.
- Lindsay Leikin.

03:17.370 --> 03:20.497
I'm the head psychic
in the department. This is...

03:20.607 --> 03:22.540
- sort of my joint.
- They, um...

03:22.623 --> 03:26.506
- hire psychics around here?
- Personally, I'm a little bit skeptical.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.588
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

03:28.820 --> 03:31.403
I was just getting
a very strong vibration. Did you...

03:32.023 --> 03:33.857
did you just recently
take up the guitar?

03:34.261 --> 03:37.847
Oh, my God.
Yes, just recently.

03:38.123 --> 03:40.346
Very impressive.
How did you do that?

03:40.390 --> 03:43.223
Sometimes there's just this
amazingly strong connection

03:43.278 --> 03:46.350
from the word go.
I'm getting something else.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.124
This is gonna be a very,
very good week for you,

03:49.168 --> 03:51.477
- Lindsay Leikin.
- Really, I...

03:51.600 --> 03:54.495
- didn't think...
- Just... let it happen.

03:58.828 --> 04:01.379
So let me officially welcome you
to Santa Barbara.

04:01.413 --> 04:03.534
We are all ready
and willing to...

04:03.578 --> 04:05.705
Don't let me interrupt.
Please continue.

04:05.777 --> 04:07.251
What'd I say about seats
on the side?

04:07.307 --> 04:09.583
Mr. Spencer, this is
Special Agent Ewing

04:09.627 --> 04:11.157
from the Treasury Department
in Washington.

04:11.190 --> 04:13.334
Yes, we sniffed one another
in the hallway.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.336
He is here because
they have been tracking

04:17.391 --> 04:19.634
an aggressive forger who's been
counterfeiting large numbers

04:19.678 --> 04:22.346
of $100 bills and then
laundering the money

04:22.402 --> 04:23.761
into small communities
across the country.

04:23.816 --> 04:26.501
The last being a Home Depot right here
in the heart of your little hamlet.

04:26.545 --> 04:29.142
Well, we are raring to help you
with this federal bust.

04:30.306 --> 04:31.345
Who is this?

04:31.433 --> 04:33.924
This is Carlton Lassiter,
our head detective,

04:33.957 --> 04:36.222
and his junior partner,
Juliet O'Hara.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.115
Ah, the name Juliet.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.877
"How silver-sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night. "

04:41.184 --> 04:43.097
Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet.

04:43.251 --> 04:44.251
"Tootie,

04:44.684 --> 04:46.599
you in trouble. "

04:47.720 --> 04:49.244
It's Mindy Cohn.
Facts of Life.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.481
Could you gentlemen
please state your name once again?

04:53.536 --> 04:54.928
And please speak clearly.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.968
Is that a recording device?
Government issued?

04:58.542 --> 04:59.979
Asking if that
is a recording device

05:00.012 --> 05:02.100
is like asking if this
is a pen.

05:02.283 --> 05:04.074
- Is it a pen?
- That's classified.

05:07.681 --> 05:08.730
It's tiny.

05:08.807 --> 05:11.801
- Probably can't hold much.
- Oh, that's not a tape recorder.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.431
That is a high-tech microphone system
attached to a Mildred.

05:14.496 --> 05:16.368
A Mildred?
What's... what's a Mildred?

05:16.390 --> 05:18.207
I believe it's an
intelligence-gathering device.

05:18.229 --> 05:21.411
"Mildred" is probably an anagram.
Military Intel Listening Device

05:21.482 --> 05:23.010
Recorder... something.

05:23.054 --> 05:25.462
Mildred is not a device.
She's my stenographer.

05:26.511 --> 05:27.934
You have your own stenographer?

05:28.023 --> 05:31.066
I am hyper-careful.
Can't take any chances.

05:31.210 --> 05:34.450
Saved my behind more than once
in making cases stick past deposition.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.020
- Brilliant. Chief?
- Not happening.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.765
Now what I need from all of you
is your full cooperation

05:39.798 --> 05:42.926
in assisting Special Agent Ewing
in any way he sees fit.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.367
- Now, any questions?
- I have a question for Special.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.837
- Who is this?
- I'm sorry.

05:47.892 --> 05:50.600
This is Shawn Spencer.
And his partner, Burton Guster.

05:50.688 --> 05:52.771
Mr. Spencer is a psychic
with the department

05:52.826 --> 05:54.097
who I thought might be helpful.

05:54.218 --> 05:57.290
Well, next time I have to go on a
panty raid, I'll give him a call.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.903
But we already have our own psychic.

05:59.973 --> 06:03.287
She's just started in the department
and she is already a superstar.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.737
Got us so close to the counterfeiter
a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.704
We must have missed him
by only a few minutes.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.494
- Mr. Spencer,
- Lindsay... Leikin.

06:12.488 --> 06:15.864
- We too met in the hallway.
- Okay, then

06:15.908 --> 06:17.267
let's adjourn this meeting.

06:17.747 --> 06:21.669
I know Special Agent Ewing has prepared
informational packets for all of you.

06:21.768 --> 06:27.210
- We will meet at the Home Depot tomorrow.
- Let's say... 0700 hours.

06:27.265 --> 06:29.994
- 700 hours is almost 20 days.
- Shouldn't we act sooner?

06:30.033 --> 06:32.972
- 0700 is 7:00 a. m.
- Precisely, Detective.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.656
- Striking and whip-smart. Intriguing.
- I knew that too.

06:36.745 --> 06:38.846
You have Pennsylvania Ave.
Running through your veins.

06:38.902 --> 06:41.460
Ever consider taking the Bureau exam?

06:42.460 --> 06:43.460
I have.

06:43.924 --> 06:46.498
Let me set up that conference
area for you.

06:46.576 --> 06:47.642
Right this way.

06:48.150 --> 06:50.448
Little skeptical of psychics, are we?

06:50.515 --> 06:51.885
I should have said "just you. "

06:51.977 --> 06:55.332
And don't think I didn't pick up on
that calluses on my hands guitar clue.

06:55.574 --> 06:58.215
Good one. This is gonna be good.

06:58.469 --> 07:01.462
I'm gonna solve this case,
and I'm gonna prove you're a fake.

07:01.531 --> 07:02.686
Fun, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:37.241 --> 07:41.641
Okay, you are all instructed to cooperate
fully with the federal agents.

07:42.350 --> 07:44.725
I'll be damned if we're gonna get
shown up on our own turf.

07:44.769 --> 07:47.946
They may be the feds, but we are
a team and this is our town.

07:48.046 --> 07:49.637
They will need us.

07:49.771 --> 07:52.709
You breached protocol, Leikin.
I waited outside the hotel, 0630.

07:52.742 --> 07:54.317
- You weren't there.
- Yeah, sorry.

07:54.339 --> 07:56.273
I got up early and went
to go get coffee.

07:57.234 --> 07:58.814
Son, let me ask you a question.

07:58.881 --> 08:01.268
What made you think those
$100 bills were authentic?

08:01.427 --> 08:03.877
Um, 'cause they said "100" on them.

08:04.864 --> 08:07.461
Are you an idiot?
Don't answer that.

08:07.549 --> 08:10.002
If I plopped a Granny Smith apple
down on this counter

08:10.046 --> 08:12.383
and carved a "100" on it, would you
accept that as legal tender?

08:12.473 --> 08:15.736
Don't answer that.
Do you know what microprinting is?

08:15.803 --> 08:19.349
- I'm confused. Should I answer that?
- I know what it is.

08:19.407 --> 08:22.954
The introduction of microprinting
as an anti-replicant feature

08:22.987 --> 08:28.045
began in 1990 with the addition
of the words "United States of America"

08:28.151 --> 08:30.145
printearound
Ben Franklin's lapel.

08:30.189 --> 08:32.808
In addition, the words
"U.S. 100" are printed

08:32.841 --> 08:35.070
within the lines
of the lower left 100.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.530
I'm sorry... is it just me,
or is this unbearably boring?

08:38.582 --> 08:42.174
I don't know how Ms. Leikin works,
but Gus and I

08:42.384 --> 08:44.725
are going to investigate
the body of the store

08:44.826 --> 08:50.261
and search for our culprit's
twisted, wretched, filthy aura.

08:50.337 --> 08:53.624
Because that is what
serious psychics do.

09:00.423 --> 09:02.423
Shawn. What are you doing?

09:04.092 --> 09:06.688
- Shawn?
- Dad.

09:07.103 --> 09:09.236
Wow, you look so tiny
down there.

09:09.335 --> 09:10.805
What the hell are you doing
up there?

09:10.838 --> 09:13.475
What does it look like I'm doing?
We're making a case.

09:13.875 --> 09:17.288
- A federal one.
- Oh, of course you are.

09:17.354 --> 09:18.813
Well, when you've finished
wrapping things up

09:18.835 --> 09:21.435
for the Pentagon, I want you at my house.
I got a project for you.

09:21.535 --> 09:23.381
Afraid we're gonna be
a little busy having our pictures

09:23.426 --> 09:26.696
taken with the President of the
United States of America.

09:26.815 --> 09:29.179
Mm, oh, I think you'll be there.

09:29.263 --> 09:30.810
- You owe me.
- I owe you?

09:30.888 --> 09:33.871
Yeah, for the last 12 times I helped
you solve one of your little cases...

09:33.937 --> 09:35.666
- you agreed.
- Gus, did I agree to that?

09:35.748 --> 09:38.302
Well, technically...
I think you did.

09:41.142 --> 09:42.545
See ya.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.281
- Excuse me. Can I help you guys?
- Hello, Garrison.

09:56.336 --> 09:57.750
We're working
on the counterfeiting case.

09:57.795 --> 10:00.513
And we need to see all of
yesterday's security footage.

10:01.087 --> 10:02.933
How do you know my name's Garrison?

10:04.418 --> 10:06.197
You thought this was
gonna be a problem?

10:06.570 --> 10:08.559
I'm sorry, man. I... I didn't
mean to freak you out.

10:08.605 --> 10:12.035
My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm a
psychic with the police department.

10:12.090 --> 10:16.245
There was already a psychic here
last night. From Washington, no less.

10:16.322 --> 10:19.265
She looked at all the tapes
and there was no positive ID.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.985
She already came here, huh?

10:21.416 --> 10:24.490
And she's good.
She also knew my name was Garrison.

10:25.213 --> 10:28.793
Uh, you mind if I take a peek anyway?
I work a little differently than her.

10:28.846 --> 10:31.034
My process is a little more complex.

10:31.084 --> 10:34.664
I can sometimes pick up images
that are underneath the...

10:34.878 --> 10:37.931
- epidermal layer.
- Here it is.

10:38.031 --> 10:40.672
This is the tape of the counterfeiter
that she looked at last night.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.600
You know, honestly,
if that pretty lady psychic

10:43.655 --> 10:46.907
couldn't pick up anything, I can't
imagine you're gonna have much luck.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.565
You know what, you're probably right.
We gave it a shot.

10:49.632 --> 10:50.902
Thanks, Garrison.

10:52.299 --> 10:56.010
Tall? Short?
Age? Race?

10:56.115 --> 10:57.298
Do you mean to tell me
that the only thing

10:57.331 --> 10:59.220
you can remember clearly
is that he was a man?

10:59.287 --> 11:02.381
And technically, I can't even
be sure of that, now, can I?

11:02.857 --> 11:05.083
Wait. I'm getting something.

11:05.248 --> 11:10.188
- He... did not wear corrective lenses.
- Actually, that is true.

11:10.288 --> 11:13.649
Okay, well, that's something to go on.
Good work, Mr. Spencer.

11:13.738 --> 11:16.688
Great... and so we're looking
for someone in Santa Barbara

11:16.743 --> 11:21.414
- who does not wear glasses.
- He... He had a small scar...

11:22.150 --> 11:23.851
about three inches,
on the jaw line.

11:23.907 --> 11:29.531
And... he wore a single stud
diamond in his left ear.

11:29.586 --> 11:31.806
Yes. And yes.

11:32.368 --> 11:35.746
She's exactly right.
I can see that clearly now.

11:36.479 --> 11:38.446
That's why she's the best.

11:45.605 --> 11:46.831
Tough break.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.471
Wh... Jules...

11:53.393 --> 11:55.570
Dad, I'm confused.
There are plans for a wet bar.

11:55.801 --> 11:57.580
Yeah, that's right.
For entertaining.

11:57.635 --> 12:01.822
Right, but I don't see anywhere in
the plans the portal into 1976.

12:01.905 --> 12:05.484
Shawn, a wet bar happens to be
a timeless home feature.

12:05.568 --> 12:09.186
Right, perfect for those warm
summer evenings when Reggie Jackson

12:09.219 --> 12:11.993
and Dyan Cannon swing by
for Harvey Wallbangers.

12:12.077 --> 12:14.696
Shawn. Are you gonna crack wise
or are you gonna get to work?

12:14.751 --> 12:17.038
I feel like it should be noted
that neither Gus nor myself

12:17.097 --> 12:19.517
- are licensed plumbers.
- Yes, I understand that, Shawn.

12:19.561 --> 12:20.644
I've already installed the sink.

12:20.677 --> 12:23.616
All you two have to do
is connect the fittings.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.305
All right.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.398
- Let's get to work.
- Seriously?

12:30.446 --> 12:32.434
- This will be good.
- It will?

12:32.435 --> 12:33.435
Work is good, Gus.

12:33.510 --> 12:35.941
Work is glorious.
It's the breath of life.

12:37.322 --> 12:38.891
- What is this?
- It's a drill.

12:39.013 --> 12:40.393
Of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

12:40.504 --> 12:43.222
You're still upset that Lindsay showed
you up at the crime scene, aren't you?

12:43.269 --> 12:44.451
What is her trick?

12:45.023 --> 12:48.423
- Maybe she's just more psychic-y than you.
- Gus, don't be ridiculous.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.482
- There's no such thing as psychics.
- I don't know, Shawn.

12:50.543 --> 12:52.897
Even I've been getting
a little bit of intuition lately.

12:53.003 --> 12:56.892
In fact, I'm getting something
right now. Something very strong.

12:56.969 --> 12:59.714
She's... she's...
better than you.

12:59.825 --> 13:01.847
You know, they say imitation
is the greatest form

13:01.880 --> 13:03.029
of flattery, but that hurts.

13:03.104 --> 13:05.281
- It hurts below the belt.
- Shawn, if you want to beat her,

13:05.341 --> 13:06.998
then we have to actually
work the case.

13:07.071 --> 13:09.872
Utilize my knowledge.
You know I have a coin collection.

13:09.927 --> 13:11.374
I've studied tender
from around the world.

13:11.468 --> 13:13.998
I have over 85 Buffalo
nickels, Shawn.

13:14.317 --> 13:15.410
Okay.

13:16.241 --> 13:20.257
First of all, and this is key,
don't ever, under any circumstances,

13:20.302 --> 13:22.470
ever admit that to anyone
outside of these walls.

13:22.537 --> 13:24.747
Secondly, I love utilizing
your knowledge, Gus.

13:24.791 --> 13:27.244
I can't wait until we have
the case of the missing thimble.

13:27.443 --> 13:29.653
But this case is not about
counterfeiting.

13:29.806 --> 13:33.409
It's about me versus her.
Ecks versus Sever.

13:33.536 --> 13:37.810
- Joe versus the Volcano.
- Fine. Then let's get to it.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.515
- What do you know?
- All right, this is what I got.

13:41.247 --> 13:43.932
He managed not to be identified
on any of the security cameras,

13:43.977 --> 13:45.093
which means he's smart.

13:45.155 --> 13:46.758
Smart enough to stay
ahead of the game.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.212
Which means changing up anything that
could be linked or traced to him.

13:49.274 --> 13:53.179
Like his vehicle. His key.
It was distinctively Nissan.

13:53.256 --> 13:55.693
Probably a Murano.
Maybe a Sentra.

13:55.892 --> 13:58.207
So we go back and check
the outdoor surveillance cameras

13:58.240 --> 13:59.980
from the store, and look for Nissans

14:00.040 --> 14:01.808
- in the parking lot yesterday.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:01.841 --> 14:02.747
I already tipped Lassiter off
to that.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.504
The only one that didn't check out
was a new one with no plates.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.674
Ewing's informational packet
links this guy

14:07.730 --> 14:09.707
to over a dozen vehicles
since he left Washington.

14:09.752 --> 14:11.906
His pattern's to spend
six to eight days

14:11.936 --> 14:13.516
in a town before pricking up ears.

14:13.593 --> 14:16.272
- You read Ewing's informational packet?
- Cover to cover.

14:16.393 --> 14:18.493
That's weird.
I just read the cover.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.139
But I don't need
to read the whole thing

14:20.161 --> 14:21.354
to know that that's his M.O.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.381
He's too smart to still be
driving that car, Gus.

14:23.425 --> 14:25.600
He's gotta be switching out
his mode of transportation

14:25.645 --> 14:27.495
- on a daily basis.
- And paying cash.

14:27.517 --> 14:29.661
Gotta launder as much
of that funny money as he can.

14:29.672 --> 14:32.600
So the question is, to which car
dealership would a crook go

14:32.652 --> 14:36.055
to spend lots of cash
without pricking up ears?

14:41.692 --> 14:43.868
This must be what Jay Leno
feels like when he walks

14:43.924 --> 14:47.601
into his garage. Which makes
you Kevin Eubanks.

14:48.094 --> 14:50.017
I don't think they roll
around town together, Shawn.

14:50.216 --> 14:52.516
- Can we talk to the owner?
- First we play customer.

14:52.616 --> 14:55.330
It's the people who groove
on the floor that are gonna

14:55.374 --> 14:56.516
give us the scoop, Gus.

14:56.865 --> 14:58.698
Excuse me, my buddy here
is interested

14:58.731 --> 15:01.803
in the bana yellow Ferrari, though
he's neither gay nor European.

15:01.862 --> 15:03.332
I hope that's not a prob...

15:03.740 --> 15:05.818
Look who finally figured it out.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.144
Little late.

15:21.201 --> 15:22.496
How did you not notice her, Shawn?

15:22.595 --> 15:23.965
- I wasn't expecting her to be here.
- You were looking right at her

15:24.021 --> 15:25.435
She's got me all out of whack.

15:25.484 --> 15:27.584
- Get your head in the game.
- So what's going on?

15:27.617 --> 15:28.545
No one calls us anymore.

15:28.601 --> 15:30.663
That's the new thing?
I thought we were a team.

15:30.746 --> 15:32.271
Yeah, first of all,
the whole "team" thing.

15:32.315 --> 15:35.518
She wasn't talking to you.
And secondly, Ewing didn't call me.

15:35.553 --> 15:36.525
He called O'Hara.

15:38.296 --> 15:41.390
- It's not like I asked him to.
- It's okay, Clarice.

15:41.478 --> 15:44.207
- You don't have to make excuses to us.
- It wasn't just today.

15:44.252 --> 15:45.622
My phone's been ringing
all the time.

15:45.666 --> 15:48.943
I don't know how he got my home number.
I mean, please.

15:49.009 --> 15:51.411
Do you think I wanted to pick up
my phone at 2:00 a. m.

15:51.500 --> 15:56.019
and hear his voice all gravelly
and masculine?

15:56.803 --> 15:58.616
Probably called from the hotel.

15:58.704 --> 16:05.068
Maybe just got out of the shower or...
finished with a swim. Dripping wet.

16:08.205 --> 16:10.756
Just catch Mr. Spencer and
Mr. Guster up

16:10.789 --> 16:12.734
on what Ms. Leikin
was able to figure out.

16:12.778 --> 16:15.566
Apparently our guy came in here,
bought a used Lamborghini

16:15.621 --> 16:19.035
- for $47,000 in cash.
- Next day, he tries to return it.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.946
All sales are final, but the
sales manager makes a concession,

16:21.991 --> 16:23.803
offering mere $26,000 in cash.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.189
He accepts it?
What kind of idiot is this guy?

16:26.233 --> 16:27.989
A genius idiot,
according to the feds.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.082
You see, those familiar
with this sort of thing

16:30.115 --> 16:31.287
know that it's the classic grift.

16:31.331 --> 16:33.817
Essentially, he traded 47 Gs
of worthless paper

16:33.857 --> 16:37.171
for $26,000 in cold, hard cash.
I've seen it before.

16:37.226 --> 16:39.746
- Where, in a Mamet play?
- Any witnesses?

16:39.801 --> 16:42.441
No, but a Lamborghini
was spotted outside of town

16:42.474 --> 16:44.738
in Goleta, but it was moving
too fast to make an ID.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.528
You know, I don't think
he's a swimmer.

16:46.596 --> 16:49.377
He's not really that build.
I bet he plays rugby.

16:50.831 --> 16:52.047
Hey, what color is that suit?

16:52.527 --> 16:53.909
- Black.
- Really?

16:53.996 --> 16:56.967
- It seems blacker than black.
- It's Washington black.

16:57.420 --> 17:00.286
Look, if anyone wants to join me,
I'm gonna be taking a look

17:00.342 --> 17:02.751
at some of the bills from the safe
that didn't get deposited.

17:08.751 --> 17:12.291
Look, Leikin, I think it's possible
that we got off on the wrong foot.

17:12.378 --> 17:14.297
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I mean, this is silly.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.638
We should join forces
like Pitt and Jolie, you know?

17:16.661 --> 17:18.130
Work together,
make it nice for everyone.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.384
I don't think you get it.
I have nothing to gain here.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.295
If you haven't noticed,
my job is safe.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.155
It's you I'm worried about, faker.

17:25.199 --> 17:27.741
- In that case, maybe we should just date.
- I'm seeing somebody.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.377
- Well, is it...
- Serious?  Yes.

17:29.399 --> 17:30.791
- You didn't know I was gonna...
- Yes, I did.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.704
Dude, don't you know the move
where you take off

17:41.737 --> 17:43.262
your jacket and you lay it
across some seats?

17:43.301 --> 17:45.997
- Get your head in the game, Shawn.
- Uh, budgies?

17:47.400 --> 17:51.413
These are good.
But they're not great.

17:51.446 --> 17:55.379
You see how on this bill, the edge of
the nose on Ben Franklin's cloudy?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.111
Did you get that, Mildred?

18:04.106 --> 18:06.957
Hey, is there any reason
a $100 bill would change colors?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.238
Actually, yes.

18:08.327 --> 18:10.419
It's an effect caused
by color-shifting ink.

18:10.519 --> 18:12.701
It's only present in $100 bills.

18:12.778 --> 18:14.999
The changing color
is called color diffraction.

18:15.065 --> 18:16.860
And it's made possible
when light reflects

18:16.882 --> 18:19.194
off of metallic flakes
added to the ink.

18:24.613 --> 18:26.848
- Good work, Gus.
- Thank you.

18:27.966 --> 18:31.637
So we'll check the information that
Ms. Leikin's gathered for us...

18:31.659 --> 18:34.670
Thank goodness!
Finally, some nice seats, huh?

18:35.709 --> 18:37.411
This is what I'm talking about.

18:41.169 --> 18:42.185
What?

18:42.241 --> 18:45.173
Did I... did I just sit
in something?

18:45.847 --> 18:48.217
- Gus, do I have pudding on my jeans?
- No, no.

18:49.135 --> 18:52.637
- Nothing?
- Shawn. I think we're not welcomed here.

18:53.156 --> 18:54.891
Gus, don't be a paranoid
schizophrenic.

18:54.935 --> 18:57.206
- We're always welcome here.
- No, look.

19:02.205 --> 19:05.559
- Oh, my God. We're not welcome.
- It's nothing personal, Mr. Spencer.

19:05.614 --> 19:08.012
Special Agent Ewing just
feels that Ms. Leiken

19:08.045 --> 19:09.724
has things covered
on the psychic front.

19:09.791 --> 19:11.503
And I have to agree with him.

19:12.888 --> 19:15.342
Okay.
Take a hint.

19:15.408 --> 19:17.187
Certainly don't need
to be told twice.

19:17.242 --> 19:18.667
I think you were just told
three times.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.854
You know what, this is fine,
because we had a good run.

19:20.887 --> 19:26.488
Thank you for the memories.
Oh, just one more thing.

19:26.786 --> 19:29.062
You might want to check
the cash from the dealership,

19:29.117 --> 19:30.399
because it's not all counterfeit.

19:31.910 --> 19:33.137
That's ridiculous.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.468
If I had learned how to laugh
as a child, I would right now.

19:36.076 --> 19:37.910
I looked at all those bills myself.

19:38.937 --> 19:42.335
Do you really want to go against
the leading special agent

19:42.368 --> 19:45.481
in counterfeiting with 14 years
of experience under his belt

19:45.514 --> 19:47.050
and say that those bills
weren't fake?

19:47.260 --> 19:49.334
Not all of them. Just one.

19:49.411 --> 19:51.577
And I believe the serial
number was...

19:51.646 --> 19:58.546
- ALD... 975... 7080... 7...
- 7!

20:05.444 --> 20:06.527
Where are we going?

20:06.571 --> 20:08.372
Shouldn't we have stayed until
they checked the bills out?

20:08.423 --> 20:09.485
Wait for it.

20:10.103 --> 20:11.760
Wait for it.

20:11.786 --> 20:15.178
- Spencer. Hold up.
- The bill checked out. It's real.

20:17.602 --> 20:20.762
All right.
Answer me this, Mr. Psychic.

20:20.906 --> 20:22.696
Why would a counterfeiter
ever  use real bills?

20:22.740 --> 20:24.472
Because he had to

20:24.552 --> 20:27.999
Man... I read your informational
packet cover to cover.

20:28.678 --> 20:31.736
Our guy spends six to eight days in
every city... we're only on day four.

20:31.769 --> 20:33.891
Quite simply, he ran out of dough.

20:33.958 --> 20:36.134
He didn't know what kind of deal
he'd be able to make on the car.

20:36.178 --> 20:38.455
Turns out, short one bill.

20:38.587 --> 20:40.801
- Lucky for us.
- So what's our next move?

20:40.845 --> 20:42.143
Well, I'll call Washington
and begin...

20:42.176 --> 20:44.024
I'm sorry, I was asking
Mr. Spencer.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.029
Oh... oh, you want to know
what I think his next move is.

20:47.073 --> 20:48.531
Oh, Gus, look, she wants...

20:49.106 --> 20:51.255
Well, let's see here.
He's gotta print more money.

20:51.266 --> 20:53.708
My guess is he, uh,
set up shop here in town.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.581
So... we find his little nest,
we find him.

20:58.636 --> 21:01.469
Well, buddy...
I really hope you like this.

21:01.978 --> 21:06.054
It took me 19 hours to bake.
Put it in last night before bed.

21:06.131 --> 21:09.153
It takes 19 hours to bake
a pineapple upside-down cake?

21:09.595 --> 21:12.114
It does when it's being heated
by a 60-watt bulb.

21:15.564 --> 21:17.166
It's not upside down, Shawn.

21:18.265 --> 21:20.000
Who could that be at this hour?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.680
Are you gonna invite me in?

21:26.666 --> 21:29.567
Eh... Uh... guess.

21:30.899 --> 21:33.913
So this is what a psychic
detective office looks like.

21:33.983 --> 21:35.540
You know, I always imagined it...

21:36.091 --> 21:37.789
Does something smell like pineapple?

21:37.831 --> 21:39.062
Pineapple upside-down cake.

21:39.161 --> 21:40.281
Would you like some?
Wait.

21:40.748 --> 21:44.441
Before you answer that,
are you a fan of delicious flavor?

21:44.930 --> 21:45.935
All right, look.

21:46.331 --> 21:48.892
This isn't easy
for me to say, but...

21:49.084 --> 21:51.971
I was wrong.
You're better than I thought.

21:52.183 --> 21:54.773
Your discovery at the station today
was a huge get.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.965
I think we should
work together after all.

21:57.249 --> 22:00.292
The faster we find out where
the counterfeiter's den is, the better.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.983
That is, if you guys are willing.

22:03.237 --> 22:04.511
I don't know.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.545
Depends. Don't you think, Gus?

22:08.407 --> 22:11.322
Wait. I'm definitely getting something.

22:11.452 --> 22:12.470
Oh, this is good.

22:13.205 --> 22:15.452
It's a... it's a...
it's a transient location.

22:15.673 --> 22:19.019
Uh, where people can come and
go anonymously, paying in cash.

22:19.090 --> 22:20.342
And... and it's remote,

22:20.343 --> 22:23.423
so they can print large sums of money on
a noisy printer without being heard.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.932
- Yes... yes, I'm getting that same thing.
- Yes?

22:27.004 --> 22:28.306
- And I see it.
- Yes?

22:28.362 --> 22:29.791
It's by a body of water.

22:31.693 --> 22:34.212
Really? It's by a body of water?

22:35.111 --> 22:36.738
Leikin, that's amateur stuff.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.747
You know what, I might
expect that from John Edwards.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.869
Definitely from Miss Cleo.
But not from you.

22:40.898 --> 22:41.902
- Leikin...
- Wait.

22:42.864 --> 22:46.048
I'm also...
I'm also getting something in French.

22:46.129 --> 22:47.395
A sign, maybe?

22:47.473 --> 22:49.717
- Could it be a European hotel?
- Wait a minute.

22:49.773 --> 22:50.910
She may be on to something.

22:51.009 --> 22:53.300
I know this particular hotel.
It's on my sales route.

22:53.301 --> 22:54.305
On a private beach...

22:54.856 --> 22:56.451
- What?
- It's just... it's strange.

22:56.452 --> 22:58.567
I'm... I'm pretty familiar
with your route, Gus.

22:58.568 --> 23:01.475
I don't recall any private beaches
with hotels on them.

23:01.518 --> 23:03.739
- What are you talking about, Shawn?
- Where was it you went last summer

23:03.768 --> 23:06.496
for the Pips autograph
signing convention?

23:06.528 --> 23:07.777
- You met Gladys Knight?
- No.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.576
- Just the Pips.
- Actually, a Pip.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.279
The other two got stuck in traffic.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

23:12.321 --> 23:14.614
The point is, it's been
under construction for months.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.416
Which would account for the noise.
And it caters to Europeans.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.237
- This could be the place.
- Sweet. We totally scored.

23:20.308 --> 23:23.678
But you couldn't have got that without
my transient location thing, am I right?

23:25.426 --> 23:26.430
I don't...

23:26.431 --> 23:28.298
I don't think that cake is cooked.

23:32.415 --> 23:34.339
Listen, I need to know every guest...

23:34.340 --> 23:36.271
...cashed in the last week.

23:36.399 --> 23:38.528
I'm sorry, who are you,
and what do you want?

23:38.571 --> 23:40.226
Special Agent Lars Ewing.

23:40.436 --> 23:41.935
Federal Treasury Department.

23:42.190 --> 23:44.951
Head Detective Carlton Lassiter,
Santa Barbara Police Department.

23:45.418 --> 23:48.311
Presidential Recommendation
for Distinguished Service.

23:48.397 --> 23:50.449
Presidential Physical Fitness award.

23:50.508 --> 23:52.686
Eighth, ninth, and tenth grade.
And I've got a cocktail napkin

23:52.687 --> 23:53.691
from Air Force One.

23:54.557 --> 23:56.491
I personally arrested Ivan Boesky.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.640
I wrestled in high school.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.720
- What, with your conscience?
- That is it!

24:03.361 --> 24:06.581
Look, we need to know who's paid
with cash or travelers checks recently.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.891
My God, you're a firecracker.

24:09.079 --> 24:11.386
It would probably be easier
to ask who didn't.

24:11.428 --> 24:12.433
I'm sorry?

24:12.535 --> 24:16.426
This is a hotel. We're a cash business.
Lots of European travelers.

24:16.710 --> 24:21.044
With what foreign credit card companies
charge these days, cash is king.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.487
The south tower, I see him.

24:22.685 --> 24:24.595
I see him in the south tower.

24:24.638 --> 24:25.954
How many rooms in the south tower?

24:26.026 --> 24:27.696
There are 170.

24:27.765 --> 24:29.901
All right, let's start banging on
some doors and call for backup.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.528
If we tap every available
source of manpower,

24:31.529 --> 24:33.466
we can have this thing done
18, 19 hours tops.

24:33.535 --> 24:34.798
I can alert Washington right now

24:34.799 --> 24:36.791
and have an 80-man SWAT team
on a C-130 Hercules.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.902
They could be here in
less than three hours.

24:39.046 --> 24:40.206
Filthy sheets!

24:40.612 --> 24:41.942
I see dirty, filthy sheets.

24:42.004 --> 24:44.509
Yes, and towels on the floor.

24:44.589 --> 24:47.957
And a mediocre, half-eaten
turkey club sandwich.

24:47.992 --> 24:50.428
And he's refused maid service.

24:50.498 --> 24:52.777
Okay, what guest
refused maid service?

24:52.837 --> 24:56.077
I might remind you we do cater
to a very European crowd.

24:56.750 --> 24:57.755
He's isolated.

24:58.545 --> 25:01.626
He's in a less-desirable room
that's not facing the ocean.

25:01.627 --> 25:03.282
Do you have any rooms
that face the parking lot?

25:03.413 --> 25:04.318
A few.

25:05.726 --> 25:07.991
- He's in one of those.
- Let's see.

25:09.799 --> 25:10.804
French woman.

25:11.188 --> 25:12.546
Another French party.

25:13.217 --> 25:15.481
Here... here's a single gentleman.

25:15.482 --> 25:18.552
Paid all in cash.
Corner room facing the alley.

25:18.613 --> 25:22.179
And according to this, he's never taken
his "do not disturb" sign off his door.

25:22.690 --> 25:23.977
- Room number.
- Key!

25:26.493 --> 25:27.413
Clear!

25:29.048 --> 25:31.199
Nice job, psychics,
let's get to work.

25:31.977 --> 25:34.030
That's a really cute front-loader.

25:34.678 --> 25:35.683
Thank you.

25:35.932 --> 25:38.365
He prints the money, then he washes it
here to soften it.

25:38.588 --> 25:41.614
Then he tumbles it dry and beats it up
with stones to give it that...

25:41.615 --> 25:43.383
natural, worn texture.

25:46.835 --> 25:50.019
Dude, there's linen fibers
in that paper.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.037
What was he doing,
amending the constitution?

25:52.066 --> 25:55.424
You can't print money on regular
paper, Shawn. That's government-issue.

25:55.749 --> 25:57.022
I'm getting a visual.

25:57.418 --> 26:00.374
He printed a batch of about 50.000,
which will last him a while.

26:00.431 --> 26:02.595
Five bills a sheet, at least 80 sheets
missing from this ream

26:02.596 --> 26:04.428
that sounds about right.
- Wait.

26:04.673 --> 26:07.291
No, I'm getting more.
I'm getting a lot more.

26:07.363 --> 26:11.334
Like 500.000, which would last
more than just a while.

26:11.335 --> 26:13.123
Maybe... maybe a whole lifetime.

26:13.242 --> 26:15.166
- That's not possible.
- It is if you live in one of

26:15.167 --> 26:16.375
the Baltic states.

26:16.471 --> 26:19.075
I'm just not getting that feeling...
at all.

26:19.235 --> 26:22.872
Anything over 50.000 is just getting
blocked from my receptors. Not a chance.

26:22.974 --> 26:25.677
Receptors? Really?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.404
This would do it.

26:48.469 --> 26:50.873
This is a 500-sheet ream,
and it's likely he used it all.

26:52.218 --> 26:53.307
Treasury seal?

26:59.536 --> 27:00.541
No.

27:04.075 --> 27:05.327
Passport seal.

27:06.796 --> 27:09.130
Uh, this guy's officially on the lam.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.218
We don't catch him now,
we can kiss him good-bye.

27:13.874 --> 27:16.627
The railway stations, obviously the
airport security has been notified,

27:16.628 --> 27:18.419
and all the interstate
agencies are on alert.

27:18.447 --> 27:19.531
They've all been given the sketch

27:19.532 --> 27:21.438
based on Ms. Leikin's
description of the suspect.

27:21.482 --> 27:24.419
Okay, but please keep your phones on
just in case we get any movement.

27:24.626 --> 27:27.569
What's the point? Nobody ever
bothers to call us anymore.

27:28.707 --> 27:32.315
Shawn, I don't do this much,
but I just wanted to say thank you.

27:32.679 --> 27:36.316
I know we haven't nailed him yet,
but you were right, we make a good team.

27:37.979 --> 27:39.281
Yes, we do.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.319
And hopefully tomorrow
we'll wrap this thing up.

27:41.899 --> 27:42.903
Have a good night.

27:47.410 --> 27:48.415
Wait for it...

27:49.887 --> 27:51.231
Wait for it.

27:51.491 --> 27:54.548
Shawn, I was thinking maybe
we could go somewhere now.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.456
Maybe continue working to see
if we can't stumble upon some

27:57.457 --> 27:58.461
collective apparition.

27:58.496 --> 28:00.137
That's a fantastic idea.

28:00.217 --> 28:02.962
I love it. Where could we go at
this hour that's still open?

28:03.020 --> 28:05.553
You know what, I think there's
a Color Me Mine that stays open late.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.175
- You don't quit with the jokes, do you?
- I'm sorry, would you like me to stop?

28:09.276 --> 28:11.172
Not yet.
I kinda like it.

28:11.465 --> 28:15.159
But actually, I was thinking
back to my hotel room?

28:19.788 --> 28:23.057
You know, it's something we could try.

28:23.108 --> 28:26.901
I mean, it's not as much fun as making
ashtrays with our names on them, but...

28:27.395 --> 28:28.400
Yeah.

28:29.065 --> 28:30.763
I'm a flexible guy, a sportsman.

28:31.114 --> 28:32.121
Good.

28:32.270 --> 28:35.559
All right, I'll head back to freshen up.
What do you say we meet at 2200 hours?

28:35.630 --> 28:37.692
Perfect. Oh, I'm so rude.

28:37.693 --> 28:39.150
Gus, buddy, would you like to join us?

28:39.193 --> 28:40.665
- Well, I...
- That sucks,

28:40.666 --> 28:43.283
so 2200 on the dot. I'll be there.

28:47.551 --> 28:50.127
Dude, what time is 2200 hours?

28:51.846 --> 28:53.232
Gus.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.450
Buddy, help me out.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.716
What is it?
Is it, like, 11:00 times two?

28:57.971 --> 28:58.975
Buddy!

29:08.163 --> 29:12.393
So, tell me, Shawn. Are you planning on
doing psychic police work forever?

29:13.565 --> 29:14.570
No.

29:15.829 --> 29:18.543
No, just until I find
the girl of my dreams.

29:18.911 --> 29:22.177
And then I'll whisk her
off to Carmel and...

29:23.309 --> 29:25.340
Open a small haberdashery...

29:26.543 --> 29:28.383
Do some macrame, maybe.

29:29.385 --> 29:30.899
Maybe blow some glass.

29:32.016 --> 29:36.346
Well, as hot as that sounds, I think the
psychic world would miss your talents.

29:36.722 --> 29:38.533
Just make sure they appreciate you.

29:38.589 --> 29:43.693
After a while, the world tends to take
people with our abilities for granted.

29:45.133 --> 29:47.859
Well, that's awfully easy
for you to say.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.549
I mean, you've already met
your special someone...

29:51.069 --> 29:52.376
Your handsome prince.

29:54.132 --> 29:56.891
You're serious with somebody, remember?

29:59.049 --> 30:01.762
Actually, I...

30:01.763 --> 30:04.155
recently had a change of heart.
- Really?

30:06.247 --> 30:09.218
Would a certain psychic
have anything to do with that?

30:09.332 --> 30:11.199
Well, we do have quite a connection.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.902
We do. It's...

30:13.638 --> 30:17.954
It's like our minds are just
fused together, you know?

30:17.955 --> 30:21.166
I feel like Holly Hunter
in Broadcast News, you know,

30:21.167 --> 30:23.177
when she's inside
William Hurt's head?

30:24.099 --> 30:25.259
Okay, let's try it.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.133
I'm thinking of something.

30:28.175 --> 30:30.496
- None... they don't bury the survivors.
- Yes, exactly.

30:30.524 --> 30:33.722
You have a favorite color,
and I'm seeing... sea foam green.

30:33.764 --> 30:35.948
Actually, it's blue, but
that is so near the green family.

30:35.976 --> 30:38.007
- Pick a number between one and ten.
- Eight.

30:39.596 --> 30:40.608
That's close enough.

30:48.970 --> 30:51.757
- You totally wanted me to do that.
- You totally read my mind.

30:52.221 --> 30:56.747
♪ Dissolve the nerves
that have just begun ♪

30:57.336 --> 30:59.898
♪ Listening to Marvin ♪

30:59.912 --> 31:01.978
♪ All night long ♪

31:02.072 --> 31:04.966
♪ This is the sound ♪

31:04.967 --> 31:06.848
♪ of my soul ♪

31:07.079 --> 31:10.207
♪ This is the sound ♪

31:10.342 --> 31:12.908
Whoa, slow down.
What do you mean she took off... when?

31:12.950 --> 31:15.457
You know, I don't know when.
She tricked me, okay?

31:15.506 --> 31:17.834
She clearly wants to take
all the credit for herself.

31:18.902 --> 31:21.152
Look, just... just meet me over here.

31:21.767 --> 31:24.117
Oh, that's Lassie on the other line.
I gotta take it.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.593
- You're dropping me for Lassiter?
- Hurry up!

31:26.925 --> 31:28.467
You wait till now to call us?

31:28.502 --> 31:30.561
I called you as soon as I heard.
Do you think I want

31:30.562 --> 31:32.493
Junior G-man here to
beat me to the punch.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.725
Thank you.

31:38.477 --> 31:41.024
Well, it's affirmative...
our counterfeiter.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.537
Shot with his own gun...
there are signs of a struggle.

31:43.679 --> 31:46.456
Checks out as Steven J. Grabinski.
His only priors are a couple counts

31:46.457 --> 31:48.954
of petty theft, and small-time
fraud in Washington.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.032
He had a small scar, about three
inches on the jaw line, and...

31:53.033 --> 31:56.925
He wore a single stud diamond
in his left ear.

31:58.465 --> 31:59.484
Damn, she's good.

32:07.299 --> 32:08.643
Whoa... touchy!

32:08.907 --> 32:10.903
I don't know how you do it
in Washington, but here,

32:10.904 --> 32:13.299
we don't disturb the body till
forensics has a chance to come in,

32:13.300 --> 32:15.379
collect some evidence.
- Lassiter, ease up.

32:15.659 --> 32:17.852
We're lucky if our psychic
doesn't lick the body.

32:17.951 --> 32:18.956
Well...

32:19.347 --> 32:21.276
I guess congratulations are in order.

32:21.277 --> 32:23.665
We have to hand it
to our federal agents here.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.983
Though we would have preferred
to bring him in and charge him,

32:26.984 --> 32:28.744
this case looks pretty much wrapped up.

32:29.137 --> 32:31.883
There's no need to congratulate us
for doing what is our job.

32:31.884 --> 32:34.661
We don't ask for commendation for
what is merely our proud honor

32:34.662 --> 32:35.934
of servitude to our country.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.165
Perhaps just a small hug.

32:40.081 --> 32:41.510
Just an itty-bitty one.

32:42.232 --> 32:43.278
I'm serious.

32:44.622 --> 32:45.655
Too much?

32:50.236 --> 32:51.368
So how'd you sleep?

32:55.133 --> 32:58.430
Well, I guess I was right
about one thing.

32:58.473 --> 33:00.617
It turned out to be a
pretty good week for you.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.169
Look, I'm sorry, Shawn.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.025
I don't know what
you want me to say to you.

33:18.026 --> 33:19.150
I don't know either.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.749
You lost a case. You lose.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.388
She's on the winning side,
you're on the losing side.

33:22.389 --> 33:24.004
She's the winner, you're the loser.

33:24.864 --> 33:28.471
You know, dad, had I made
a list of things I did want to hear,

33:28.472 --> 33:30.697
that wouldn't even
have made the top eight.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.215
Something is really off with this cake.

33:34.358 --> 33:37.159
But, Shawn, you want my advice,

33:37.160 --> 33:38.518
I think you should quit.

33:39.592 --> 33:40.668
- What?
- You should quit.

33:40.669 --> 33:42.819
That's what you do. When things get tough,

33:42.820 --> 33:44.907
somebody's better than you, you quit.

33:44.977 --> 33:46.787
- Where is this even coming from?
- Oh, come on, Shawn,

33:46.788 --> 33:48.941
I've got 80 examples sitting
on the tip of my tongue.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.976
Eighth grade you quit the bassoon when
Bobby Nowocinski beat you out

33:51.977 --> 33:53.455
for the solo in the winter festival.

33:53.505 --> 33:54.383
Let me get this straight.

33:54.384 --> 33:58.542
You have an example from eighth grade
sitting on the tip of your tongue?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.741
Shawn, the point is, a year from now,

34:00.742 --> 34:03.282
you won't even be working for
the Santa Barbara Police Department.

34:03.324 --> 34:05.600
- You don't know that.
- All right, look, Shawn,

34:05.601 --> 34:08.533
now I'm gonna tell you something
that you do want to hear.

34:11.728 --> 34:14.340
I accept you for who you are.

34:15.842 --> 34:17.952
- Is that a fact?
- That is a fact.

34:18.013 --> 34:21.056
You don't have to prove anything to me.
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

34:21.848 --> 34:23.773
Now, how's that feel, better?

34:24.310 --> 34:26.545
Now you can go ahead,
and you can quit this too.

34:31.051 --> 34:33.210
First of all... and I think
I can say this now

34:33.212 --> 34:34.789
with a fair amount of certainty...

34:34.790 --> 34:36.996
there's definitely something
not right about this cake.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.694
Maybe because it was baked
with a child's oven.

34:40.147 --> 34:42.920
We're talking about a deluxe
Easy-Bake Oven, Gus.

34:42.920 --> 34:46.050
I paid over $300 for it on eBay.
This is hardly a toy.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.014
Okay, I didn't major in psychology,

34:48.014 --> 34:50.603
but I'm gonna guess this doesn't have
anything to do with the cake.

34:50.659 --> 34:51.664
I'm sorry.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.972
It's got nothing to do with you or me
or my dad or the cake.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.565
It's got a little something
to do with the cake.

34:59.169 --> 35:02.665
But it's mostly about Lindsay
showing us up on this case.

35:03.793 --> 35:06.269
She's either a crazy-good psychic,

35:06.270 --> 35:08.633
or she's just a better
detective than me.

35:08.881 --> 35:11.532
Hey, I thought you had her
back at the hotel

35:11.536 --> 35:13.969
when you surprised her
with that $500.000 thing.

35:14.422 --> 35:16.672
<i>I'm getting more...
I'm getting a lot more.</i>

35:16.673 --> 35:20.736
Like 500.000, which would last
more than just a while.

35:20.737 --> 35:22.842
- Maybe a whole lifetime.
- That's not possible.

35:23.421 --> 35:24.581
I did have her.

35:24.922 --> 35:26.521
I totally had her. Come on!

35:32.017 --> 35:33.732
Mildred, you kept a record of everything

35:33.733 --> 35:35.785
that was said in this investigation.
Am I right?

35:35.842 --> 35:38.134
If someone as little as burped,
I got it down.

35:38.161 --> 35:39.804
- There's a symbol for burp?
- Terrific.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.192
I need you to clarify something for me.

35:41.193 --> 35:43.808
Two days ago, in the morning,
outside the Home Depot center.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.674
Ewing and Leikin making small talk.
Can you read that back?

35:49.096 --> 35:53.720
- What was that, 0700 hours?
- No, no, it was 7:00 a. m.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.455
Here's something.

35:55.553 --> 35:58.058
Ewing: "Do you know
of a good chocolatier?"

35:58.059 --> 35:59.977
Leikin: "I had someone in Seattle,

35:59.978 --> 36:02.860
specialized in hazelnut
praline stuff... very good."

36:02.902 --> 36:05.010
- It was just after that.
- Something about the dye

36:05.011 --> 36:06.552
used in public swimming pools

36:06.553 --> 36:08.068
to identify urine?
- No.

36:08.116 --> 36:09.375
- The musical Wicked?
- No.

36:09.408 --> 36:11.310
- Something about coffee?
- Yes, that's it.

36:11.382 --> 36:12.690
Mildred, could you read
the coffee thing?

36:12.732 --> 36:14.685
Ewing: "You breached protocol, Leikin.

36:14.686 --> 36:18.426
I waited for you outside the hotel,
0630, but you weren't there."

36:18.468 --> 36:21.058
"Yeah, sorry, I got up early
and went to grab coffee."

36:22.360 --> 36:24.784
Mildred, where are Ewing and Leikin now?

36:24.848 --> 36:28.606
Where I'm supposed to be... catching
a chartered flight back to Washington.

36:28.607 --> 36:29.885
- I'm late.
- Not a problem.

36:29.886 --> 36:31.994
We'll give you a ride. We happen
to be headed that way.

36:32.022 --> 36:32.843
That's great.

36:32.919 --> 36:35.141
- Mildred, here, say this.
- Shotgun.

36:35.266 --> 36:36.412
Tough luck, buddy.

36:39.081 --> 36:41.216
Well, folks...

36:41.217 --> 36:43.906
You all did a nice job
on this investigation.

36:45.393 --> 36:46.861
So, uh...

36:47.285 --> 36:49.252
you have a MySpace page or something?

36:51.036 --> 36:52.196
Whoa, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay!

36:52.197 --> 36:53.498
Wait, wait, wait!

36:56.853 --> 36:59.787
I just wanted to make sure I had
an opportunity to congratulate you,

36:59.788 --> 37:01.112
you know, personally.

37:01.662 --> 37:05.136
- Thank you. It's not necessary.
- No, no, no, it is necessary.

37:05.137 --> 37:06.847
You did it. You cracked it.

37:06.848 --> 37:09.988
I mean, you deserve all the credit...
You're amazing. She's an amazing person.

37:10.419 --> 37:13.234
Look, Shawn, don't feel too bad.

37:13.235 --> 37:17.800
- There'll be other cases.
- Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

37:19.739 --> 37:20.913
But not for you.

37:21.474 --> 37:22.817
You see...

37:22.818 --> 37:25.903
It all started when you identified
the scar on the jaw line

37:25.904 --> 37:28.479
of our counterfeiter, along with
his little diamond-stud earring.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.294
I mean, I couldn't even
draw a hair color.

37:31.518 --> 37:34.058
So there's no way that
you could do that unless...

37:34.468 --> 37:36.124
Unless you'd already seen him before.

37:39.771 --> 37:41.738
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?

37:42.743 --> 37:45.077
It's not like I'm wearing
a giant moose costume.

37:46.526 --> 37:48.391
I had a vision you were drinking coffee.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.305
- Oh, congratulations.
- But not at the hotel.

37:53.892 --> 37:57.862
You were driving past one Starbucks,
two Starbucks, 17 Starbucks,

37:57.863 --> 37:59.815
and ended up all the way in Goleta.

38:00.481 --> 38:02.518
On the very same day that
Grabinski's Lamborghini

38:02.519 --> 38:05.716
was spotted just outside of town in...
Anybody?

38:07.068 --> 38:09.516
- Special?
- Goleta.

38:09.646 --> 38:12.084
That's right. Goleta.

38:13.389 --> 38:17.224
The two of you were partners
and you were in touch the whole time.

38:17.411 --> 38:20.326
What's more, they were
lovers in the night.

38:20.552 --> 38:21.727
I'm seeing somebody.

38:21.785 --> 38:24.219
I didn't think it was possible
to fall in love with somebody

38:24.220 --> 38:25.587
in the span of five minutes.

38:25.657 --> 38:28.959
She got us so close to the counterfeiter
a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.878
Probably just missed him
by five minutes.

38:30.935 --> 38:32.145
That's when you met him.

38:32.591 --> 38:34.501
You didn't miss him. She had him.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.512
She had your bad boy red-handed.

38:36.563 --> 38:38.176
Suddenly you were much more interested

38:38.177 --> 38:40.836
in combining forces and
making a whole lot of money.

38:41.340 --> 38:42.471
And it was going well.

38:42.952 --> 38:44.240
It was going very well...

38:45.118 --> 38:46.494
Until you blew it.

38:46.636 --> 38:48.281
You know which moment
I'm talking about, right?

38:48.282 --> 38:50.220
The one in the hotel room.
When you realized

38:50.221 --> 38:52.929
he had printed way more than
the 50,000 that you'd planned.

38:52.930 --> 38:53.948
And the passport?

38:54.358 --> 38:57.244
So you called him that morning,
you met him at the warehouse.

38:57.245 --> 38:59.355
It was you who struggled with him.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.920
And it was you who shot him dead.

39:04.157 --> 39:06.067
Only then, having your vision

39:06.068 --> 39:09.081
that miraculously led everyone
here to the crime scene.

39:09.945 --> 39:14.674
Oh, come on. I mean, I've seen poor
losers before, but this is just sad.

39:15.297 --> 39:16.824
Your DNA was all over him.

39:17.062 --> 39:20.416
But you covered your tracks by touching
the body in front of everybody

39:20.417 --> 39:22.735
before forensics had a chance
to come in and brush it.

39:22.945 --> 39:23.950
Or comb it.

39:24.502 --> 39:25.507
Braid it.

39:26.271 --> 39:27.884
- Maybe put it in pigtails.
- Shawn!

39:28.174 --> 39:30.197
That only leaves one outstanding issue.

39:30.198 --> 39:33.155
And that is...
Where's the rest of the money?

39:34.145 --> 39:35.149
Wait a minute.

39:35.701 --> 39:36.706
What's happening?

39:38.248 --> 39:39.414
What's happening to me?

39:39.697 --> 39:41.091
I've heard about this.

39:42.561 --> 39:44.825
It's called spontaneous
psychic krav maga.

39:49.108 --> 39:51.005
Oh, my, it's the bag.

39:51.386 --> 39:52.507
Something's in the bag!

39:52.967 --> 39:56.236
It's bad. It's very bad.
And it could be embarrassing.

40:07.159 --> 40:09.140
Well, you were wrong
about one thing, Shawn.

40:10.993 --> 40:13.173
I didn't sleep with you
because you were my enemy.

40:13.174 --> 40:16.618
I did it because I really thought
we had something.

40:16.884 --> 40:17.889
Okay.

40:18.108 --> 40:20.754
First of all, a little discretion
would be nice. All right?

40:20.810 --> 40:23.230
I mean, these are...
These are my co-workers.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.777
Secondly, anything
we had, you ruined.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.607
Because you betrayed your gift, Leikin.

40:30.853 --> 40:33.060
You give a bad name to psychics like me

40:33.061 --> 40:35.466
who pride themselves
on the purity of that gift.

40:35.467 --> 40:38.575
There are so many people out there
who already doubt what we do.

40:38.576 --> 40:41.349
Now you've given 'em all a reason
to think that we're fakes.

40:41.959 --> 40:44.533
You sicken me...
I'm sickened.

40:47.091 --> 40:50.804
I mean, sure, I'm still wildly attracted
to you on the physical level, but...

40:50.805 --> 40:54.824
spiritually and psychically,
you're dead to me.

40:56.719 --> 40:59.619
Gun! I'm taking him
and I'm taking the plane.

41:09.498 --> 41:10.984
This is not what it looks like.

41:15.728 --> 41:18.441
Okay, they're just processing
Ms. Leikin's arrest before

41:18.442 --> 41:20.187
we put her back on a plane to Washington.

41:20.314 --> 41:22.626
It'd be great if you guys could give me
this paperwork as soon as possible.

41:22.669 --> 41:23.673
Got it.

41:50.799 --> 41:52.307
Lassiter spilled a cup of coffee on me

41:52.308 --> 41:54.090
and right before I was
supposed to get on the plane.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.439
Thankfully I keep an extra
crisp, white shirt on me.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.540
Government issue, folds up
to the size of my wallet.

41:58.790 --> 42:00.333
Fits in my back pocket.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.621
Gotta love those boys
in the Gadget Tech Department.
