00:17.684 --> 00:18.685
Pity!

00:20.729 --> 00:23.232
Pity! Pity!

00:28.195 --> 00:30.989
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Let me go! I have to.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.327
No! We got to save her, Mama! We got to!

00:35.410 --> 00:38.247
-No! Stop! Stop it! Stop it, baby.
-No! Let me go!

00:40.082 --> 00:42.751
Pity! Pity! Pity!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.212
Maude! Maude!

00:45.295 --> 00:46.296
Help!

00:49.216 --> 00:51.426
Pity! Pity!

00:54.388 --> 00:55.639
Pity!

00:58.267 --> 00:59.268
Pity.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.230
Pity.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.065
Don't be scared, Maude.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.317
Don't be scared. Come on.

01:25.002 --> 01:29.298
No, no. No, get off! Get off me!

01:30.340 --> 01:31.800
Please. Baby!

01:31.884 --> 01:33.468
Let me get my baby!

01:34.970 --> 01:37.431
Let me go get my baby!

01:37.514 --> 01:40.517
My baby! Somebody get my baby!

01:41.351 --> 01:43.353
We can stop now, Pity.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.633
Good morning.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.426
Hey.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.639
Oh, you feel hot.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.309
Been running through fire.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.522
Tar paper shack up in flames.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.441
My little girlfriend, Maude Petit,
was in there, about to burn up.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.360
I run in and saved her.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.487
That sound like
a good dream this time.

03:15.571 --> 03:20.492
I don't know if I'd call it that,
but it was a long time coming.

03:20.576 --> 03:24.788
Yeah, well, whatever it was,
you seem nice and calm. That's new.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.040
Yeah, well, not up here.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.839
I remember 54, 55 years ago,

03:33.922 --> 03:39.428
I was reading this comic book about Thor,
Norse god of thunder.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.392
His old man, Odin,
had a-- a chair, a throne.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.980
Throne was named Hlidskjalf.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.400
And when Odin sat on that throne,

03:53.483 --> 03:59.781
he could see everything,
everywhere, all at once.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.619
That's how I feel up here.

04:04.578 --> 04:10.250
Maude and my mama. Sensia. You.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.335
Me?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.712
You ain't even known me a month.

04:15.881 --> 04:19.384
Wouldn't be no me sitting here
if you wasn't sitting next to me.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.806
Is I'm still hot?

04:25.849 --> 04:28.810
Yeah. Take some of this water.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.730
It's for your pill.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.984
I'm gonna go take a shower.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.821
Ms. Shirley Wring called.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.284
W-R-I-N-G!

04:44.368 --> 04:45.369
Yes.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.339
Hello?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.258
It's me, Ptolemy.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.718
I knew who it was.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.012
I knew it was you before the phone rang.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.098
What can I do for you, Ms. Wring?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.351
-You can say "yes."
-Yes.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.187
Don't you even wanna know
what you saying yes about?

05:12.271 --> 05:13.397
Sure I do,

05:13.480 --> 05:17.192
but if I say yes now or after,
it won't make no difference.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.444
You kinda crazy, ain't you, Ptolemy Grey?

05:19.528 --> 05:22.865
I am, but it's the crazy
what keeps me going.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.659
Well, if it keeps you going
to having lunch with me,

05:25.742 --> 05:29.037
I'm thinking Monique's Tea House
on Hill Street.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.457
I'll be at my apartment, two o'clock.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.630
Can it wait? Just a day.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.507
I'm taking some new medication,

05:40.591 --> 05:42.634
and it's kinda getting the best
of me right now.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.304
-So, tomorrow?
-Without a doubt.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.806
-One o'clock?
-I'll be there.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.934
-Bye, Ptolemy.
-Bye, Shirley.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.528
Bye, Shirley.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.034
Oh, I'll be out your way in a sec.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.785
Just wanted to use the mirror real quick.

06:08.869 --> 06:09.870
I like that one.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.333
Yeah? I wasn't too sure about it at first,
but, I don't know, maybe.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.753
How's Ms. Wring?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.213
Invited me to tea.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.590
-Tea?
-This afternoon.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.843
All right, well, if y'all excited then…

06:24.927 --> 06:27.179
How long you and Roger gonna be out
this afternoon?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.598
I don't know. Why?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.393
Well, I was thinking maybe after lunch,
I'd come home, do a little entertaining.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.356
-Define "entertaining."
-Man got to have some secrets, ain't he?

06:38.190 --> 06:40.943
All right, well,
you keep all your secrets.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.152
What kinda time you need?

06:42.236 --> 06:44.363
Well, lunch ought to be over about 3:00.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.240
I'd say, couple more hours.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.407
A couple of hou--

06:49.701 --> 06:52.204
Okay. Well, don't hurt yourself, Uncle.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.248
I ain't gonna make no promises
on that count.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.130
Hi.

07:06.677 --> 07:07.761
How you doing?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.805
-Fine, you?
-Good.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.856
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.192
Hey, Pitypapa.

08:05.277 --> 08:11.533
If you had a free day, rent paid,
money in the bank…

08:12.784 --> 08:13.869
…what would you do?

08:19.291 --> 08:24.505
I'd get us up before the sun.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.220
Take the bus down to Lake Altoona.

08:33.764 --> 08:38.684
We'd take off our socks and shoes,
walk down to the shoreline,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.563
watch the sunrise.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.898
That all?

08:45.359 --> 08:46.985
Then we'd go to a museum,

08:48.111 --> 08:50.822
surround ourselves with the beauty of art.

08:59.957 --> 09:00.958
Yeah.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.931
Mr. Grey.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.267
Good morning.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.240
-What's your name?
-Hernandez.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.701
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hernandez.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.704
No, Mr. Grey.
Not Mr. Hernandez, just Hernandez.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.039
I like that name.

10:22.915 --> 10:26.877
-You from around these parts, Hernandez?
-40 years here. Thirty-eight, really.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.797
When I was seven, my parents came up
from a farm in the south of Mexico.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.216
Still speak Spanish?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.885
Nah, just got this accent is all.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.054
I know some words.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.097
Funny, the things that stay with you, huh?

10:39.181 --> 10:40.474
Yeah.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.434
Yeah, it's funny.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.059
Excuse me.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.189
Them eyes there,
w-what do you see?

11:29.273 --> 11:30.274
I-I don't--

11:30.357 --> 11:33.944
I mean,
w-when you look ab-- about the eyes,

11:34.653 --> 11:36.780
just tell me what you see.

11:41.827 --> 11:42.828
I don't know.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.123
Determination, maybe?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.586
-Conviction. Defiance.
-No, no, no.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.964
I mean, yeah, y-you--
You probably right.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.634
But wha-- what I meant was…

11:59.261 --> 12:00.262
the color.

12:01.346 --> 12:06.101
W-When you look around his eyes,
what-- what color is that?

12:07.811 --> 12:08.812
Blue?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.023
-Blue?
-Blue.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.150
Blue…

12:14.776 --> 12:16.278
-Sure is.
-Yeah.

12:16.945 --> 12:17.946
Blue.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.073
Thank you, ma'am.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.158
No problem.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.244
Blue.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.499
Blue.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.045
Blue.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.197
Look at you, boy.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.993
There you go. Let's get it.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.955
Go on. Cast it.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.249
Get a good one.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.918
Come on. You can do better than that.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.265
-Why are we sl-- stopping?
-'Cause we're here, Mr. Grey.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.185
-Where's here?
-Lake Altoona.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.312
That's where you said
you wanted to go next, no?

13:34.648 --> 13:35.816
Yep. Yep, sure did.

14:15.772 --> 14:16.815
Pretty.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.320
Seen prettier, but it'll do.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.572
It's almost time.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
I know.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.160
Best be getting home.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.332
One last thing, then I'll be there.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.086
I promise.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.672
Don't be too long, okay, Pity?

14:41.715 --> 14:42.716
I'll try.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.329
Here we are, Mr. Grey.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.872
Home again, home again.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.875
Thank you, Hernandez.
Been a pleasure.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.502
Likewise.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.254
This here…

15:23.131 --> 15:24.466
This here's for you.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.219
Thank you, but no tips.
Against regulations.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.971
Oh, well, don't think of it as a tip,

15:29.054 --> 15:34.268
you know, think of it as a-- a favor
or extended services.

15:35.227 --> 15:39.690
Now, there's gonna be a man,
a severe-looking man with spiky hair,

15:39.773 --> 15:43.110
gonna-- gonna come down here
to my apartment building door.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.528
What's this about, Mr. Grey?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.488
Oh, it ain't nothing
for you to worry about.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.949
It's just that
when he comes in,

15:49.032 --> 15:51.410
I'd like for you to wait,
like, five minutes

15:51.493 --> 15:54.997
and start blowing your horn
like you came to pick me up or something.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.083
You know, blow your horn
like the world coming to an end.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.668
Blow it like the devil, all right?

15:59.751 --> 16:02.337
-That's it? That's all you want me to do?
-Yes, sir, that's it.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.756
If you can find it in your heart
to do that for me,

16:04.840 --> 16:06.341
you'll make an old man happy.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.637
I'll do it for you, Mr. Grey.

16:12.431 --> 16:13.682
No need to pay me.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.688
Thank you. Thank you, Hernandez.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.566
That's very kind of you.
I appreciate it.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.650
Yes, sir.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.360
-You have a good evening.
-You too.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.238
Two plus nine equals 11.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.663
Two plus nine equals 11.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.464
Robyn.

18:12.092 --> 18:16.346
I'm sitting here waiting--
waiting for the truth.

18:17.014 --> 18:20.100
Even though I can remember
all the way back now,

18:21.101 --> 18:24.104
I don't know
for a fact what happened.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.149
And a man needs to know the truth.

18:27.232 --> 18:31.278
I know I do, so I can act accordingly.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.830
I'm-- I'm sorry
for what's about to happen here today.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.293
But I got to set things right.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.756
That motherfucker got to pay
for what he done.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.221
I know this ain't what you wanted…

18:59.848 --> 19:01.099
but ain't no other way.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.856
That's him. The truth in a man's body.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.152
I know you in there, old man.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.446
I love you, Robyn.

19:22.371 --> 19:25.165
-Who is it?
-You know damn well who it is.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.751
Open the goddamn door!

19:28.502 --> 19:29.878
Come on in. It's open.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.642
Have a seat, Mr. Gulla.

20:02.411 --> 20:07.541
When I was a boy in Burdette, Mississippi,
old men used to tell us boy children

20:07.624 --> 20:10.252
not to drink liquor out of no bottle
that wasn't sealed.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.045
Oh, yeah? Now, why's that?

20:12.129 --> 20:14.173
Well, back then, men had enemies

20:14.256 --> 20:16.425
put a dram of poison in your liquor
in a minute.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.594
Yeah, but you's drinking
from the same bottle.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.970
Did you see me drink?

20:23.640 --> 20:26.059
You better stop fucking around, old man.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.187
You're liable to get yourself hurt.

20:28.270 --> 20:32.566
See, and that right there is another
reason might be poison in that bottle.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.444
Like you say, I'm old,

20:35.527 --> 20:38.363
throwing my life away
just to ease the pain.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.284
You telling me
you put something in this whiskey?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.119
You kill my nephew?

21:04.056 --> 21:06.058
I ain't trying to poison you, Alfred.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.435
You better not.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.818
I see you looking at my gold coins.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.987
Thinking about taking them?

21:19.071 --> 21:20.697
Doing more than thinking.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.742
Besides, what good they gonna do you?

21:24.409 --> 21:25.494
What you gonna do?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.663
Travel off to Vegas,
sow your wild oats, nigga?

21:27.746 --> 21:30.499
You so old
your dick don't get hard no more.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.671
Matter of fact, what Nina told me,
you can't even go outside

21:35.754 --> 21:37.756
'cause there's some woman
that come and rob you

21:37.840 --> 21:39.216
every time she fucking see you.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.467
Now, imagine that.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.136
Grown man scared of a bitch.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.389
This nigga ought to be bullwhipped.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.893
What would you do if you had these coins?

21:49.977 --> 21:52.938
Take 'em to a Jew jeweler.
If it's real gold, I sell it for weight.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.900
Exactly what I expect a fool to say.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.069
-And who the fuck you calling a fool?
-You.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.739
Look at these doubloons.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.909
They old. Real old.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.955
Original American coins.
Collector's items.

22:10.747 --> 22:14.918
One of these worth
more than $40,000 to a collector.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.464
Four for the gold they made out of.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.176
All right.

22:23.552 --> 22:26.138
Well, you give 'em to me,
and I'll get a collector to buy 'em.

22:28.473 --> 22:33.520
I can fix it
so you'd get one of these every month,

22:33.604 --> 22:36.148
or its value, for the next year.

22:36.231 --> 22:40.944
I can do that.
All you gotta do is answer my question.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.530
-Thought you already knew the answer.
-I do.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.867
But I wanna hear it come out your mouth.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.537
Now, why the fuck would I do
something like that?

22:50.621 --> 22:52.873
Same reason your Black ass is here.

22:53.707 --> 22:54.750
For the money.

22:56.251 --> 23:00.714
Two coins every month,
or their value, for a year.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.969
Watch it, son. This ain't no joke.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.444
Yeah.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.532
Yeah, I killed your poor little nephew.

23:27.783 --> 23:31.662
Shot him dead in the head
'cause he tried to take my girl away.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.081
Now I got his house.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.584
I got his woman, my woman.

23:38.961 --> 23:41.380
Driving in his car.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.340
Sleeping in his bed.

23:44.508 --> 23:47.761
His child and mine,
both of them call me daddy.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.182
Wh-Wh-What?

23:52.266 --> 23:53.976
Who saw me in that alley?

23:54.059 --> 23:55.978
Pull out your gun, boy!
Draw on him.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.772
Hey! Look here.
Who saw me in that alley?

23:59.398 --> 24:02.067
Newspapers didn't say nothing
about no damn witnesses.

24:03.193 --> 24:07.155
Do you believe in the devil, Mr. Gulla?

24:11.451 --> 24:12.786
I got your devil right here.

24:12.870 --> 24:15.455
Yeah. Now, I'ma take these gold coins.

24:15.539 --> 24:19.543
And I think I'ma go ahead
and stay with Nina, yeah?

24:19.626 --> 24:23.130
And then you gonna tell me
who saw me that night.

24:23.213 --> 24:25.883
I ain't telling your punk ass shit.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.342
Now…

24:27.426 --> 24:30.762
…if you don't give me that money
and tell me what I wanna know,

24:30.846 --> 24:33.348
I'ma choke your old ass out.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.976
And then I'ma beat
that stuck-up bitch, Robyn,

24:36.059 --> 24:38.520
till she give up
all your gold coins and secrets.

24:38.604 --> 24:40.147
Robyn, no!

24:43.859 --> 24:46.111
Oh, man.

24:46.195 --> 24:49.406
-You're strong for an old man.
-That's why I'm still here.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.366
Yeah, you think you can beat me?

24:51.450 --> 24:54.119
I don't know about that,
but I can sure as hell shoot your ass.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.413
Hey, hold on, old man.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.540
Sensia shot her husband with this here.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.959
Hey, hey! Sh--

25:01.043 --> 25:02.169
What?

25:02.252 --> 25:04.129
You mother--

25:17.643 --> 25:19.394
Oh, I couldn't let him hurt Robyn.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.772
Get him, boy! Get him before he escape!

25:21.855 --> 25:22.856
Hurry up!

25:24.858 --> 25:26.610
No, no, no.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.787
Oh, God.

25:49.091 --> 25:50.092
Mama?

25:53.720 --> 25:55.138
You can't let him hurt Robyn.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.557
Sensia?

25:57.140 --> 25:59.476
He ain't no better
than the men who lynched me.

26:01.228 --> 26:04.606
No, Pity. No! We can go swimming.

26:07.526 --> 26:09.862
Stop them men from fighting.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.405
You always told me, Unc…

26:13.240 --> 26:15.367
family all you got.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.494
-Come on, baby.
-Get him, boy.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.171
Hey!

26:27.254 --> 26:29.756
-Fucking--
-Somebody! He don't look right.

26:33.552 --> 26:34.553
Fuck!

26:38.056 --> 26:39.057
Oh, God.

26:39.141 --> 26:42.144
-What's this?
-Someone help me.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.730
-Somebody help me.
-Hey, call an ambulance!

26:46.398 --> 26:48.483
-What you doing?
-I'm trying to help you.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.235
Get off. That's my shit, man. Give--

26:50.319 --> 26:53.113
-I'm trying to get help for you! Stop!
-I'ma fucking kill you.

26:53.197 --> 26:54.198
Stop! Let me go!

26:54.281 --> 26:57.201
Give it! Let me go! Let me go!

26:57.284 --> 27:00.829
Hey! You-- You!
You, g-get away from that man, thief!

27:01.955 --> 27:03.665
Get away!

27:03.749 --> 27:05.876
-I'm gonna call an ambulance.
-Fuck you!

27:05.959 --> 27:08.420
Oh, God.

27:08.504 --> 27:11.632
You-- I got you.
I got your ass.

27:13.175 --> 27:15.302
I got-- I got him, Reggie.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.596
I-- He gonna pay.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.223
That's right. You're gon--

27:20.057 --> 27:21.058
Run.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.477
Ru-- Run. That's right, run.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.898
Please help me. I ca-- I c--
I got this-- this-- this motherfucker.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.529
He gonna-- He-- He gonna pay.
He-- He gonna pay.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.373
Look out, boy!

27:44.456 --> 27:46.208
Coy?

27:46.291 --> 27:48.085
-It's over, Pity.
-Put down the weapon!

27:48.168 --> 27:51.255
-It's over.
-I got it. Mr. Grey.

27:51.338 --> 27:54.049
Mr. Grey, I need you to lower that weapon.

27:55.509 --> 27:56.760
Need you to do it right now.

27:58.262 --> 27:59.263
You understand me?

28:03.100 --> 28:06.144
I see you, Mr. Grey. I see you.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.733
I got you. I got you.

28:14.111 --> 28:15.112
I got you.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.197
-He's clear.
-I got you.

28:20.242 --> 28:23.495
Oh, Lord. Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.956
Lord have mercy.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.585
I got you, Mr. Grey.

28:30.377 --> 28:33.547
Walk with me. All right? Walk with me.

28:34.423 --> 28:35.549
Walk with me.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.801
You have the right to remain silent.

28:37.885 --> 28:40.804
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.556
You have the right to an attorney…

28:47.311 --> 28:48.395
Mr. Grey?

28:49.938 --> 28:51.273
Mr. Grey, can you hear me?

28:57.988 --> 28:59.198
Mr. Grey.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.159
Satan.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.620
Is we in hell?

29:05.412 --> 29:06.580
How are you?

29:08.165 --> 29:10.918
Beat the devil.
Ain't that something?

29:12.127 --> 29:13.253
Yes, you did.

29:23.263 --> 29:24.681
How you feeling, Pity?

29:25.265 --> 29:27.059
C-Coy-- Coydog.

29:27.142 --> 29:29.978
I d-- I done-- I done what you asked,

29:30.062 --> 29:33.273
and-- and the treasure stayed a treasure

29:33.357 --> 29:35.484
'cause it was anointed in blood.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.778
I always knew you would.

29:45.661 --> 29:46.787
Hey, old man.

29:48.997 --> 29:51.500
Reggie! Reggie!

29:51.583 --> 29:52.668
How you feel?

29:52.751 --> 29:54.294
Oh, Reggie.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.214
Reggie, I'm so sorry.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.549
Sorry about what?

29:59.800 --> 30:02.427
I-- Oh, I-- I-- I forget.

30:02.511 --> 30:04.429
Ain't nothing to be sorry about, Uncle.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.765
You did the best you could.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.935
I-- I guess I did.

30:21.113 --> 30:22.531
Don't fight it, Uncle.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.616
I can get that for you.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.577
Robyn.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.955
First bird of spring.

30:35.711 --> 30:36.712
All rise.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.055
Sit, please.

30:51.101 --> 30:54.271
I have studied the briefs presented,
and it seems clear to me

30:54.354 --> 30:57.816
that after this meeting, I will be able
to adjudicate this case in its entirety.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.860
Well, I would like to take
this opportunity

30:59.943 --> 31:04.281
to renew my objection to the special entry
into evidence Ms. Barnet's team offers.

31:04.364 --> 31:07.075
Your Honor, it is stated clearly
in Mr. Ptolemy Grey's will

31:07.159 --> 31:11.163
if a suit is brought against his wishes,
this testimony must be brought to light.

31:11.246 --> 31:14.291
After all, we are here to test
the viability of his last wishes.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.502
You don't need to tell me
why we're here, Ms. Liem.

31:17.961 --> 31:21.965
I see no reason why Mr. Grey's request
cannot be entered into evidence.

31:22.049 --> 31:24.843
No matter what Ms. Barnet
or her lawyers say,

31:24.927 --> 31:26.595
there can be only one resolution

31:26.678 --> 31:31.266
as to the question of the validity
of Mr. Grey's so-called last wishes.

31:31.350 --> 31:34.353
I have here 33 statements

31:34.436 --> 31:36.230
from neighbors, friends,

31:36.313 --> 31:38.815
from business owners
from around Mr. Grey's neighborhood.

31:38.899 --> 31:43.070
They all say, without exception,
that Mr. Grey was showing signs

31:43.153 --> 31:46.281
of what the law understands
as non compos mentis

31:46.365 --> 31:48.408
for at least the last six years.

31:48.492 --> 31:51.620
A time well before
Ms. Barnet ever met him.

31:51.703 --> 31:56.959
Mr. Grey's family has taken
comprehensive care of all of his needs.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.711
The only reason
Ms. Barnet ever became aware of him

31:59.795 --> 32:02.923
is because Hilda Brown asked her
to look after him once.

32:03.006 --> 32:03.841
That's right.

32:03.924 --> 32:07.928
Whatever Ptolemy Grey leaves to this world
should go to his family

32:08.011 --> 32:09.972
and to the people
who actually care about him.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.640
Not to some young woman

32:11.723 --> 32:15.310
who obviously took advantage
of a confused old man.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.565
Mr. Abromovitz, what do you say
about Mr. Malman's claims?

32:19.648 --> 32:22.359
Ptolemy told me
his family might dispute the will

32:22.442 --> 32:23.694
using just these arguments.

32:23.777 --> 32:27.739
I suggested he go see Angela Liem
in order to rebuff any notion

32:27.823 --> 32:30.492
that he was mentally challenged
in any way.

32:41.795 --> 32:44.214
I have three red apples, two oranges,

32:44.298 --> 32:46.216
and a sausage link I bought at the market.

32:47.134 --> 32:48.886
Oh, well, when I was a kid,

32:48.969 --> 32:52.806
a sausage link and some homemade
applesauce would have made my day.

32:54.474 --> 32:56.351
How many apples do I have?

32:56.435 --> 32:58.979
is I'm talking to you
or to the camera?

32:59.062 --> 33:00.189
To me is great.

33:00.272 --> 33:04.151
Well, you said you had three,
so I guess I got to believe you.

33:05.444 --> 33:06.904
What is today's date?

33:06.987 --> 33:11.450
Today's date is April 21, 2021.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.661
That's three days
after my sister June's birthday.

33:15.412 --> 33:16.788
You remember that, Niecie?

33:16.872 --> 33:18.832
What is your full name?

33:18.916 --> 33:21.793
My name is Ptolemy Roberts Grey.

33:21.877 --> 33:26.673
Ptolemy, after a Greek king of Egypt
who was also Cleopatra's father.

33:26.757 --> 33:30.594
Roberts, which was
my mother's maiden name, her family name.

33:30.677 --> 33:34.848
And Grey after my father,
who I never had a chance to meet.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.767
Do you know why we're here today,
Mr. Grey?

33:36.850 --> 33:39.269
Yeah, in order for me
to make a binding will,

33:39.353 --> 33:43.732
I have to prove that I'm in my right mind,
of sound mind.

33:43.815 --> 33:46.777
You are aware of the video camera
recording our conversation?

33:46.860 --> 33:50.030
Yeah, this is my first time
being on video camera.

33:50.113 --> 33:51.615
When I was a child in Mississippi,

33:51.698 --> 33:53.784
precious few people even had
a regular camera.

33:53.867 --> 33:57.329
So, it's all right with you
that I use this method to prove

33:57.412 --> 34:01.208
that you are not experiencing
any mental difficulties at this time?

34:01.291 --> 34:02.334
Oh, yes, ma'am.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.545
-So, you wanna make a trust?
-Yes, I do.

34:04.628 --> 34:08.757
And I want to make
Robyn Barnet my trustee.

34:08.841 --> 34:11.260
I mean, not that she'll own everything,

34:11.342 --> 34:13.719
but that she'll be the one
to say what happen to it.

34:13.804 --> 34:17.683
And do you feel that your family
does not deserve what you leave behind?

34:17.766 --> 34:19.016
No, it ain't like that.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.645
I mean, they good people,
for the most part.

34:21.728 --> 34:25.940
But I just want Robyn to be the one
in charge of the money on a month-to-month

34:26.024 --> 34:29.277
and to make sure that the money is there
for Reggie's kids

34:29.360 --> 34:30.654
when they wanna go to college

34:30.737 --> 34:34.783
and to probably put a little money
on-- on Hilliard's books

34:34.867 --> 34:36.409
when he eventually go to prison.

34:36.493 --> 34:39.621
And why do you want Ms. Barnet
to be in charge, Mr. Grey?

34:39.705 --> 34:42.875
Robyn the kinda person
gotta be in charge of where she at.

34:42.958 --> 34:47.087
You know, she make sure everybody's okay
before she go to sleep at night.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.797
You know, order just come natural to her.

34:49.882 --> 34:52.885
And, you know,
she ain't wasteful or frivolous.

34:52.967 --> 34:56.429
Can I--
Can I say something personal to her?

34:56.513 --> 34:57.598
Go ahead.

34:58.682 --> 35:02.102
Robyn, I want you to know

35:02.186 --> 35:06.732
that because of who you are
and the things that you've done,

35:07.691 --> 35:14.531
I know that Coy would be glad
that I'm leaving his legacy in your hands.

35:15.991 --> 35:16.992
You saved me.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.995
You helped me keep my promise.

35:21.038 --> 35:26.668
And I want you to know that all them years
before you, they mean nothing.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.631
I love you, Bird.

35:38.722 --> 35:43.268
Well, obviously, we reserve
the right to investigate all documents

35:43.352 --> 35:46.897
and to have our experts evaluate
this-- this evidence.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.941
But there are other issues at hand here.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.025
Such as?

35:50.108 --> 35:51.902
Such as the age of this woman.

35:51.985 --> 35:54.821
-She's a teenage girl.
-I'm 18 years old.

35:54.905 --> 35:58.200
A teenage girl, with barely
an equivalency high school degree,

35:58.283 --> 36:01.787
who, by the way, assaulted my clients
with a deadly weapon.

36:01.870 --> 36:04.873
Objection. There is no evidence
that Ms. Barnet has ever attacked anyone.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.875
No police report, no 911 call--

36:06.959 --> 36:10.963
She was seen chasing a woman
down the street, beating her with a chair.

36:11.046 --> 36:11.922
Hearsay.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.258
She never went to see Mr. Grey
in the sanatorium.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.217
That's because they--

36:15.300 --> 36:18.303
Because Mr. Grey's blood family
was given temporary conservatorship,

36:18.387 --> 36:21.181
and they banned Ms. Barnet
from even visiting him.

36:21.265 --> 36:23.433
-For six months.
-And then there's this lawyer.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.435
He has held the purse strings

36:25.519 --> 36:28.438
to Mr. Grey's trust for over half a year.

36:28.522 --> 36:33.735
Working in close contact with Ms. Barnet,
he has given the plaintiffs almost nothing

36:33.819 --> 36:36.405
and refuses to release
a schedule of distribution.

36:36.488 --> 36:39.116
That is as Mr. Grey wished it.

36:39.199 --> 36:41.326
-Oh, so you say.
-Are you calling me a liar, Malman?

36:41.410 --> 36:43.787
-Oh, please. Come on now.
-Gentlemen, please, sit down.

36:43.871 --> 36:46.874
Look, all I'm saying, Your Honor,
is that this is an age-old case

36:46.957 --> 36:50.335
of a young woman seducing an older man
for his money.

36:50.419 --> 36:52.880
You're going after her.
You're going after me.

36:52.963 --> 36:56.633
Gentlemen, sit down!

36:56.717 --> 36:57.801
Please, sit down.

36:59.136 --> 37:01.263
Or I will have you both held in contempt.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.432
It's time for lunch.

37:03.515 --> 37:06.643
Let's take a recess and reconvene at 2:30.

37:07.519 --> 37:11.106
Ms. Barnet.
Do you mind staying for a bit to talk?

37:28.123 --> 37:29.917
Did you threaten Hilda and her son?

37:34.963 --> 37:36.256
You're trying to trick me.

37:36.340 --> 37:40.260
-No. I'm just trying to understand.
-Understand what?

37:40.344 --> 37:42.554
This whole case is odd.

37:42.638 --> 37:44.556
Dementia that momentarily disappears,

37:44.640 --> 37:47.476
an old man with billions of dollars
and no formal education.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.353
Well, Papa Grey finished the third grade,

37:49.436 --> 37:52.189
and then he read books
for the rest of his life, so…

37:52.272 --> 37:53.357
What about you?

37:54.483 --> 37:58.153
Your father shot down in the streets
and your mother a prostitute.

38:01.031 --> 38:06.328
You know, there was this--
this white man who used to pay my mother,

38:06.411 --> 38:09.790
and he came over to the house one day
when she was out.

38:09.873 --> 38:12.459
He tried to rip off my clothes.
I pull out a knife.

38:12.543 --> 38:16.755
He cut me here
before I could lay a lamp upside his head.

38:17.297 --> 38:19.508
I stabbed him eight times.

38:19.591 --> 38:22.135
And it was only a white man's luck
that he didn't die.

38:22.719 --> 38:25.597
But my mother's face when she saw me,

38:25.681 --> 38:29.977
she pulled it together,
she sewed me up herself.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.478
She did what she could.

38:33.689 --> 38:37.025
I don't care what my mother was.
She loved me.

38:38.569 --> 38:40.320
So did Mr. Grey, it seems.

38:44.992 --> 38:48.287
I've never known anybody like him.

38:49.454 --> 38:54.585
He waited his whole life to do right,
and he made it by a hair.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.964
-He murdered Alfred Gulla.
-Yeah, well, Alfred deserved it.

39:00.966 --> 39:03.343
Maybe you should have
your lawyer present.

39:03.427 --> 39:04.428
Why?

39:04.511 --> 39:06.638
Because you just admitted to assault.

39:06.722 --> 39:08.432
So, what? You gonna throw me in jail?

39:08.515 --> 39:10.267
I might decide against you in the hearing.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.728
-Oh, I don't care about that.
-You don't want the money?

39:12.811 --> 39:13.812
What I want?

39:14.855 --> 39:18.233
I want my degree in astronomy,

39:18.317 --> 39:21.987
and I want a seat
on Elon Musk's flight to Mars.

39:22.070 --> 39:24.156
If you don't want the money,
why are you here?

39:24.239 --> 39:26.158
It's because I love Papa Grey.

39:26.909 --> 39:30.746
And I know he would've wanted me
to stand up for myself and represent him.

39:32.289 --> 39:35.876
What if I decide
that you should oversee Mr. Grey's trust?

39:37.920 --> 39:40.380
I didn't know about the recording he made.

39:43.467 --> 39:45.636
Before I saw that, I was--

39:45.719 --> 39:50.349
I was pretty sure that-- that you were
gonna decide for Niecie and 'em.

39:50.432 --> 39:56.230
And Mr. Abromovitz told me that
they might could break the will.

39:56.939 --> 39:59.775
So, I already made my peace with it.

40:00.484 --> 40:02.736
But what if the decision goes to you?

40:02.819 --> 40:08.534
I have three and a half years
of college to get a BS,

40:08.617 --> 40:14.957
and then between four and six years
for graduate school after that.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.836
So, in-- in ten years
I'll have my education,

40:18.919 --> 40:22.506
and Artie and Latisha
will just be getting ready for college.

40:22.589 --> 40:26.343
And by then, Hilly would have
either made something of himself

40:26.426 --> 40:27.928
or he'd be in jail, and--

40:28.011 --> 40:30.180
and Ms. Wring will probably be dead.

40:32.015 --> 40:35.811
So, if that's all Papa Grey wanted…

40:48.991 --> 40:49.992
Robyn.

40:51.159 --> 40:52.953
You can go on.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.371
Are you sure you're all right?

40:54.454 --> 40:57.249
Yeah. We ain't blood,
but she 'bout the closest thing I got.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.001
Okay.

41:04.214 --> 41:07.050
Mr. Malman said
we can dispute the decision.

41:07.759 --> 41:09.803
I don't wanna fight you, Auntie Niecie.

41:09.887 --> 41:13.015
So, if you need to go back to court,
that's on you.

41:14.808 --> 41:17.019
-How much?
-What?

41:17.769 --> 41:18.770
How much?

41:18.854 --> 41:20.480
Okay.

41:20.564 --> 41:23.734
Enough to pay your bills
and Nina's too.

41:23.817 --> 41:27.112
Enough to get the kids through college,
Hilly too if that's something he wants.

41:27.196 --> 41:29.364
And Papa Grey asked me to start

41:29.448 --> 41:32.117
a leadership grant for young Black people
trying to do better.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.535
I'm gonna talk to Mr. Abromovitz

41:33.619 --> 41:36.038
about starting a foundation
and putting most of the money into that.

41:36.663 --> 41:40.876
-Okay?
-He's my blood, Robyn, not yours.

41:40.959 --> 41:43.045
Then how come you never treated him
like blood?

41:43.128 --> 41:44.588
You think I didn't treat Papa Grey--

41:44.671 --> 41:46.048
If you'd stepped one foot
in that apartment,

41:46.131 --> 41:47.883
you'd be overseeing his affairs, not me.

41:47.966 --> 41:50.594
You have some damn nerve, little girl.

41:50.677 --> 41:54.598
Telling me what you think I did and
didn't do for Papa Grey all these years.

41:54.681 --> 41:55.849
Years.

41:56.767 --> 41:59.019
You understand that? Not weeks.

42:05.025 --> 42:07.611
-I'm sorry about what happened to you--
-Right.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.030
I am.

42:13.617 --> 42:18.080
And maybe I could've done better by you.
I see that now, but…

42:19.206 --> 42:22.417
Robyn, I took you into my home.

42:22.501 --> 42:25.295
-Then you kicked me out!
-Because I was trying to protect you.

42:25.379 --> 42:27.548
-How do you not see that?
-Whatever.

42:27.631 --> 42:30.217
'Cause Papa Grey didn't even know me,
and he took me in.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.387
He didn't want nothing from me,
and I didn't want nothing from him.

42:37.641 --> 42:39.893
Come on, please. Please.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.646
I'm not trying to hurt you.

42:43.438 --> 42:46.567
I'm just-- I'm just following
what Papa Grey wrote down.

42:47.067 --> 42:48.777
I-- I gotta do that.

42:57.035 --> 42:58.495
I missed you.

43:05.169 --> 43:06.420
And I gotta keep fighting.

43:07.171 --> 43:09.590
-But--
-I got to do that.

43:35.657 --> 43:36.658
Hey.

43:37.492 --> 43:40.037
Hey. Are you okay?

43:40.120 --> 43:41.830
Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.

43:46.376 --> 43:47.711
Papa Grey?

43:50.839 --> 43:51.840
Papa Grey.

43:53.050 --> 43:54.218
Papa Grey.

43:55.469 --> 43:56.470
Hi.

43:58.764 --> 44:00.432
-B-Bird?
-Yeah.

44:02.100 --> 44:05.395
First bird of spring.

44:05.979 --> 44:07.314
Yes.

44:07.397 --> 44:08.857
How you feeling, Uncle?

44:11.944 --> 44:13.779
There's devils in here.

44:14.821 --> 44:18.408
Girl, you better get out of here
before they lock you up too.

44:18.992 --> 44:21.453
You see how they got me tied up
to this here chair?

44:21.537 --> 44:23.580
-Yeah.
-Yeah. N-No.

44:23.664 --> 44:26.917
No. This a-- It's a bed.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.419
-A bed. Yeah.
-Yeah.

44:29.503 --> 44:32.714
But we gonna get you back
to your old apartment.

44:32.798 --> 44:34.591
And I'm gonna take care of you.

44:34.675 --> 44:36.260
And so is Ms. Shirley Wring.

44:38.595 --> 44:41.431
W-R-I-N-G.

44:42.766 --> 44:46.895
W-- W-R-I…

44:47.813 --> 44:50.899
W-R-I…

44:51.608 --> 44:55.946
W-R-I-N…

44:56.613 --> 44:58.282
-G.
-G.

45:02.786 --> 45:04.663
There was-- There was a fire.

45:05.747 --> 45:07.165
Big one.

45:08.250 --> 45:09.668
It last forever.

45:13.255 --> 45:15.924
The devil come up out of it…

45:17.134 --> 45:19.261
but I ain't tell him nothing.

45:23.432 --> 45:24.766
I'm a big boy.

45:26.810 --> 45:27.811
Yes, you are.

45:28.937 --> 45:31.023
I-- I saved Maude Petit.

45:32.733 --> 45:34.693
I runned in the fire.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.197
I just took her out.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.411
Our clothes had smoke all over them.

45:46.663 --> 45:47.664
Hey.

45:49.041 --> 45:52.085
But now everything is okay.

45:54.046 --> 45:55.047
It is?

45:55.923 --> 45:57.716
Yeah. It is.

45:58.967 --> 46:00.302
Everything okay.

46:03.180 --> 46:04.389
That's a book?

46:08.435 --> 46:10.979
I could read some of it if you like.

46:12.773 --> 46:13.774
Okay.

46:17.653 --> 46:22.491
"There are more stars in the universe
than grains of sand on the shore.

46:26.119 --> 46:28.497
And they all come from the same place."

46:31.083 --> 46:32.668
You know where that place is, Uncle?

46:43.345 --> 46:44.346
Home.

46:47.224 --> 46:48.225
Yeah.

46:51.186 --> 46:52.771
Don't cry.

46:54.356 --> 46:55.357
Home.

47:24.052 --> 47:28.682
One thing you gotta remember, Pity,
is that we born dying.

47:30.434 --> 47:36.190
Every gasp we take is one gasp closer
to eternity.

47:37.065 --> 47:40.444
If you deny that,
then life lose all its purpose.

47:42.404 --> 47:46.742
You gotta take life with death
if you wanna have any chance to be a man.

47:48.118 --> 47:51.872
But I miss Maude.
And now she gone forever.

48:00.756 --> 48:03.425
You remember how she sounded
when she'd laugh?

48:05.594 --> 48:08.347
You remember you and her running out here
on the Tickle River here,

48:08.430 --> 48:09.723
laughing and splashing?

48:13.185 --> 48:15.646
One time we grabbed a napping catfish

48:15.729 --> 48:18.857
and dragged him up onto the bank
before he could do nothing.

48:18.941 --> 48:21.735
Mama made us catfish stew that night,
and we helped.

48:23.195 --> 48:25.280
Well, that's the magic of life.

48:25.364 --> 48:28.825
As long as you can think of
your little girlfriend and smile, then…

48:31.537 --> 48:33.372
…somewhere she's smiling too.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.874
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
