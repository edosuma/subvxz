00:01.585 --> 00:04.922
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.006 --> 00:10.094
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.930
His name, Merlin.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.480
(NIMUEH CHANTING)

00:51.844 --> 00:54.263
Merlin.

01:13.324 --> 01:17.453
Camelot welcomes you,
Lord Ba yard of Mercia.

01:18.371 --> 01:22.500
The treaty we sign
today marks an end to war

01:23.167 --> 01:25.711
and the beginning
to a new friendship between our people.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.018
Why do I always get landed
with the donkey work?

02:22.101 --> 02:24.061
You're a servant,
Merlin, it's what you do.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.189
My arms will be a foot longer
by the time I get this lot inside.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.942
It's character building,
as the old proverb says,

02:30.067 --> 02:32.069
"Hard work breeds...

02:34.572 --> 02:35.740
"A harder soul."

02:36.073 --> 02:38.200
There is no way that's a proverb.
You just made that up.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.202
No, I didn't.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.121
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.581
Excuse me.

02:43.748 --> 02:46.250
Let me give you a hand with that.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.884
Hi. I'm Merlin.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.135
Kara.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.680
You're Arthur's servant,
that must be such an honor.

02:59.764 --> 03:01.265
Yeah, it is.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.643
You know,
someone's got to keep the place running.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.730
Thank you, Merlin.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.106
Hmm?

03:10.107 --> 03:13.652
Oh, yeah. Uh, no problem.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.114
It was nice meeting you.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.541
Shouldn't you be
busy running the place?

03:27.625 --> 03:28.959
(LAUGHS)

03:48.604 --> 03:50.106
(CHANTING)

04:30.521 --> 04:33.774
-When were these last cleaned?
-Last year some time,

04:33.858 --> 04:37.194
-before the feast of Beltane.
-Did it end in a food fight?

04:37.278 --> 04:40.281
-Don't all feasts?
-I wouldn't know.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.201
The airs and graces of the court
are a mystery to me.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.495
Not tonight, they won't be.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.374
-I'm going to be at the banquet?
-Not quite.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.712
You'll be there to make sure
my cup doesn't run dry.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.631
If I have to sit through
Ba yard's boring speeches,

04:57.715 --> 05:00.551
| don't see why you
should get out of it.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.554
Be sure to polish the buttons.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.810
Do you want to see
what you'll be wearing tonight?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.395
Won't this do?

05:12.855 --> 05:15.900
No, tonight you'll be wearing

05:16.025 --> 05:19.737
the official ceremonial robes
of the servants of Camelot.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.371
You can't be serious.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.670
(LAUGHS)

05:37.421 --> 05:39.173
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.856
She's pretty, isn't she?
For a handmaiden, I mean.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.776
She's pretty for a Princess,
let alone a handmaiden.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.570
Hmm.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.290
BAYARD: People of Camelot,

06:13.415 --> 06:16.794
for a great many years
we have been mortal enemies.

06:16.961 --> 06:21.090
The blood of our men stains
the ground from the walls of Camelot

06:21.423 --> 06:22.925
to the gates of Mercia.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.386
And though we remember
those who have died,

06:25.469 --> 06:27.972
we mustn't allow any more to join them.

06:29.473 --> 06:34.061
As a symbol of our good will
and of our new found friendship,

06:34.144 --> 06:37.147
| present these ceremonial goblets

06:38.065 --> 06:42.653
to you, Uther,
and to your son, Arthur

06:43.112 --> 06:45.739
in the hope that our
friendship may last.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.617
Merlin, I need to speak to you.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.995
-What is it?
-Not here. Please.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.455
| don't know who else to tell.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.334
BAYARD: Tonight we toast to
a new beginning for our peoples.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.337
We look towards a future
free from the toils of war.

07:03.007 --> 07:06.176
It wasn't until I saw him give
the goblet to Arthur that I realized...

07:06.260 --> 07:07.761
Slow down, start from the beginning.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.848
Two days ago,
| was bringing Ba yard his evening meal,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.100
we're supposed to knock,
he didn't expect me to walk in...

07:13.183 --> 07:14.852
So, what're you trying to say?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.271
If he knows I said
anything he will kill me.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.232
| will not let that
happen to you, I promise.

07:20.316 --> 07:21.942
Please, tell me what you saw.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.570
Ba yard is no friend of Camelot.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.739
He craves the kingdom for himself.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.073
Kara...

07:29.700 --> 07:32.328
Tell me, what has Ba yard done
with the goblet?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.496
He believes that if he kills Arthur,

07:34.580 --> 07:36.957
Uther's spirit will be broken
and Camelot will fall.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.417
What has he done with the goblet?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.127
-I saw him putting something in it...
-What?

07:40.878 --> 07:42.963
- I shouldn't, he'll kill me.
-Please tell me.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.383
Was it poison?

07:53.599 --> 07:57.478
And may the differences from our
past remain there.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.733
To your health, Uther, Arthur,

08:04.568 --> 08:06.278
the Lady Morgana,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.240
the people of Camelot.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.328
And to fallen warriors on both sides.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.250
MERLIN:
Stop! It's poisoned! Don't drink it.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.256
-What?
-Merlin, what're you doing?

08:28.300 --> 08:31.929
Ba yard laced Arthur's goblet
with poison.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.806
This is an outrage!

08:34.597 --> 08:38.977
Order your men to put down
their swords, you're outnumbered.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.651
| will not allow this insult
to go unchallenged.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.362
On what grounds
do you base this accusation?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.905
I'll handle this.

08:49.988 --> 08:54.034
Merlin, you idiot,
have you been at the sloe gin again?

08:54.118 --> 08:56.578
Unless you want to be strung up

08:56.662 --> 09:00.332
you'll tell me why
you think it's poisoned. Now.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.168
-He was seen lacing it.
-By whom?

09:05.087 --> 09:06.463
| can't say.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.716
| won't listen to this anymore.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.676
Pass me the goblet.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.766
-If you're telling the truth...
-I am.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.685
Then you have nothing to fear, do you?

09:25.941 --> 09:29.194
No. If this does prove to be poisoned,

09:29.278 --> 09:31.780
| want the pleasure
of killing you myself.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.157
(SCOFFS)

09:36.368 --> 09:37.494
He'll drink it.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.705
But if it is poisoned, he'll die.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.957
Then we'll know he was
telling the truth.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.960
-And what if he lives?
-Then you have my apologies

09:45.043 --> 09:47.171
and you can do with him as you will.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.006
Uther, please, he's just a boy.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.215
He doesn't know what he's saying.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.468
Then you should've schooled him better.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.512
Merlin, apologize.
This is a mistake. I'll drink it.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.973
No, no, no, no. It's all right.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.762
-It's fine.
-He's all yours.

10:37.721 --> 10:38.972
(SIGHS)

10:40.766 --> 10:42.100
(CHOKING)

10:55.072 --> 10:57.658
-It's poisoned.
-Guards, seize them!

11:04.081 --> 11:07.209
Merlin. Can you hear me?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.337
We have to get him back to my chambers.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.882
Bring the goblet.
We need to identify the poison.

11:16.635 --> 11:20.305
Lay him on the bed. Quickly.
He's struggling to breathe.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.141
Gwen, fetch me some water and a towel.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.812
-Is he going to be all right?
-He's burning up.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.147
-You can cure him, can't you, Gaius?
-I won't know

11:29.231 --> 11:32.568
until I can identify the poison.
Pass me the goblet.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.951
Ah, there's something
stuck on the inside.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.035
What is it?

11:42.119 --> 11:44.955
It looks like
a flower petal of some kind.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.375
-His brow's on fire.
-Keep him cool.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.794
It'll help control his fever.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.225
Ah.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.437
The petal comes from
the Mortaeus Flower.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.565
It says here that someone poisoned
by the Mortaeus can only be saved

12:11.648 --> 12:15.402
by a potion made from the leaf
of the very same flower.

12:16.028 --> 12:19.364
It can only be found in the caves deep
beneath the forest of Baloch.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.952
The flower grows on the roots
of the Mortaeus tree.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.705
That doesn't look
particularly friendly.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.459
A cockatrice, it guards the forest.
Its venom is potent.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.836
A single drop would mean certain death.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.505
"Few who have crossed
the mountains of Isgard

12:35.589 --> 12:39.801
"In search of the Mortaeus Flower
have made it back alive."

12:47.643 --> 12:50.395
-Sounds like fun.
-Arthur, it's too dangerous.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.273
If I don't get the antidote,
what happens to Merlin?

12:53.982 --> 12:56.902
The Mortaeus induces
a slow and painful death.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.363
He may hold out for four,
maybe five days

12:59.446 --> 13:00.656
but not for much longer.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.367
Eventually he will die.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.764
My lady. I am so sorry,
| haven't been here to attend to you.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.725
Don't worry. I'm all right.
How's Merlin?

13:29.267 --> 13:32.396
If Arthur comes back with
the antidote in time, he'll be fine.

13:32.479 --> 13:37.526
Then he'll be fine.
You should be with him. I'll manage.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.905
-I know what he means to you. Go.
-Thank you.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.285
What's the point of
having people to taste for you

13:47.369 --> 13:48.620
if you're going to get
yourself killed anyway.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.330
| won't fail, no matter what you think.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.541
Arthur, you are my only son and heir.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.377
| can't risk losing you
for the sake of some serving boy.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.878
Because his life's worthless?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.214
No, because it's worth less than yours.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.925
| can save him.
Let me take some men.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.552
-No.
-We'll find the antidote and return it.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.845
-No.
-Why not?

14:04.928 --> 14:08.348
Because one day I will be dead
and Camelot will need a king.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.893
I'm not gonna let you
jeopardize the future of this kingdom

14:11.977 --> 14:14.396
-over some fool's errand.
-It's not a fool's errand.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.606
-Gaius says that if we can...
-"Gaius says"?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.316
That's exactly what makes it so.

14:18.442 --> 14:22.362
Please, Father, he saved my life.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.700
| can't stand by and watch him die.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.160
Then don't look.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.206
This boy won't be
the last to die on your behalf.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.334
You're going to be King, it's something
you'll have to get used to.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.046
-I can't accept that.
-You're not going.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.591
-You can't stop me.
-Damn it, Arthur! That's an end to it.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.718
You're not leaving this castle tonight!

15:00.150 --> 15:01.651
Say what you like about the food,

15:01.777 --> 15:04.071
but you can't beat our feasts
for entertainment.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.406
Morgana, I'm sorry, I should've
made sure you were all right.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.949
Disappointed actually.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.577
| was looking forward to clumping
a couple around the head with a ladle.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.829
I'm sure the guards could've
handled Ba yard and his men.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.332
Yeah, but why let
the boys have all the fun?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.502
Morgana, you shouldn't get involved.
It's dangerous.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.712
Spare me the lecture,
I've already had it from Uther.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.174
If it's any consolation,
you weren't the only one.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.052
Not that I listened to him.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.513
Sometimes, you've got to do
what you think is right

15:29.596 --> 15:31.348
and damn the consequences.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.854
-You think I should go?
-Doesn't matter what I think.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.857
If I don't make it back,
who'll be the next King of Camelot?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.611
There's more than
just my life at stake.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.531
And what kind of King
will Camelot want?

15:48.865 --> 15:52.661
One that would risk his life
to save that of a lowly servant

15:52.744 --> 15:55.080
or one who does what
his father tells him to?

16:02.546 --> 16:05.132
Halt! Stop!

16:18.103 --> 16:19.938
He's getting hotter.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.984
(CHANTING SOFTLY)

16:31.074 --> 16:34.703
-What language is that?
-None. The fever has taken hold.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.247
None of those words are his own.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.916
His pulse is weaker.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.423
-What is it?
-That can't be right.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.010
The rash is not supposed to
appear until the final stage.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.597
What does that mean?

16:55.932 --> 16:58.560
It says here that once a rash appears,

16:58.643 --> 17:01.104
death will follow within two days.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.898
You said he had four days.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.942
Something's increased
the flower's potency.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.574
It warns that the effect of
the Mortaeus will be more rapid

17:12.656 --> 17:15.993
if an enchantment
is used during the flower's preparation.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.954
An enchantment?
But Ba yard's no sorcerer.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.750
-No, he isn't.
-Then, who did this?

17:24.461 --> 17:29.007
It can't have been.
She wouldn't dare come here.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.470
-Unless...
-Unless what?

17:33.595 --> 17:35.680
-What happened to that girl?
-Which girl?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.266
Just before Merlin burst in to the hall,

17:38.350 --> 17:40.727
one of Ba yard's serving girls
took him outside.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.521
She had dark hair, very beautiful.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.482
Find her. Quickly.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.321
MERLIN: Arthur...

17:52.489 --> 17:54.658
(CHANTING)

18:13.051 --> 18:15.428
| expressly ordered Arthur not to go!

18:15.512 --> 18:18.223
- I see it worked like a charm, too.
-Not another word.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.683
My lips are sealed.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.393
| should've put him under lock and key.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.395
You can't chain him up
every time he disagrees with you.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.230
Just you watch me.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.900
| will not be disobeyed,
especially by my own son!

18:29.401 --> 18:31.486
No, of course you won't.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.871
You knew about this, didn't you?

18:42.163 --> 18:45.542
Morgana? Don't lie to me.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.336
Arthur's old enough
to make decisions for himself.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.423
-He's just a boy.
-Have you seen your son recently?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.552
You have to let him
make his own mind up.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.596
Even if it means
letting him go to his death?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.460
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

19:33.923 --> 19:35.592
Let me guess, she wasn't there.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.887
No one has seen her since the banquet.
Who is she?

19:39.137 --> 19:42.390
-Not who she claims to be.
-But you know, don't you?

19:42.474 --> 19:46.519
Kara. Though that's not her name,
not her real name anyway.

19:46.603 --> 19:50.482
-Then who is she?
-A powerful sorceress.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.235
Well, we should tell Uther, maybe
he could send riders out after her.

19:54.319 --> 19:58.615
No. She'll be long gone.
It's impossible to know where though.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.494
-Oh, no.
-What?

20:02.619 --> 20:05.955
She knows the only place an antidote can
be found is the forest of Baloch.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.876
Arthur could be walking into a trap.

20:10.752 --> 20:14.464
Arthur... Arthur...

20:27.644 --> 20:29.062
(GROWLING)

20:30.397 --> 20:32.273

(SOBBING)

21:10.437 --> 21:11.646
ARTHUR: Hello?

21:18.027 --> 21:19.821
Are you all right?

21:20.363 --> 21:21.448
(LOUD GROWLING)

21:21.531 --> 21:22.949
(SCREAMING)

21:31.624 --> 21:33.001
Stay back.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.882
(CONTINUES GROWLING)

22:20.089 --> 22:21.549
(SCREECHING)

22:32.435 --> 22:34.562
It's all right,
I'm not going to hurt you.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.607
Who did that to you?

22:39.108 --> 22:40.276
My master.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.031
| ran away from him,
but then I got lost.

22:45.448 --> 22:49.202
-Please, don't leave me.
-I won't. I'm not going to.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.081
-You can take me away from here?
-Not yet.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.293
There's something I have to do first.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.134
Why have you come to the caves?

23:05.760 --> 23:09.097
I'm looking for something
and it can only be found here.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.099
What is it?

23:13.560 --> 23:16.145
| know this place.
| could help you.

23:17.939 --> 23:21.651
It's a type of flower that only grows
inside the cave. It's very rare.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.445
The Mortaeus Flower?

23:25.572 --> 23:28.658
| know where they are.
I'll show you.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.443
Arthur, it's a trap.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.654
It's a trap.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.533
-His fever's getting worse, isn't it?
-The poison's setting in.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.953
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

24:24.047 --> 24:26.049
Could you fetch me some more wolf bane?

24:26.382 --> 24:27.967
Yes, of course.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.138
(DOOR OPENING)

24:33.222 --> 24:36.184
Merlin, you must fight it.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.987
There they are.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.009
Keep back from the edge.

25:10.093 --> 25:13.388
Don't worry.
We'll be out of here soon.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.230
(CHANTING)

25:36.077 --> 25:37.286
What're you doing?

(CONTINUES CHANTING)

25:42.709 --> 25:44.085
(GRUNTING)

25:50.633 --> 25:54.470
-I expected so much more.
-Who are you?

25:59.100 --> 26:00.977
The last face you'll ever see.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.731
(HISSING)

26:06.399 --> 26:08.568
It seems we have a visitor.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.850
(SCREECHING)

26:41.809 --> 26:46.439
Very good, but he won't be the last.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.485
I'll let his friends finish you off,
Arthur Pendragon.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.781
It's not your destiny to die at my hand.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.161
Who are you?

27:06.042 --> 27:10.630
Arthur...
It's too dark, too dark.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.218
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

27:22.642 --> 27:24.227
Merlin.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.316
What're you doing?

27:33.903 --> 27:35.738
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

27:42.745 --> 27:46.165
Come on, then,
what are you waiting for?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.377
Finish me off!

27:52.213 --> 27:53.548
(PANTING)

27:56.592 --> 27:57.885
(GRUNTS)

28:19.115 --> 28:20.908
Leave them, Arthur.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.368
(HISSING)

28:27.915 --> 28:31.544
Go, save yourself.
Follow the light.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.446
Faster. Go faster.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.365
Follow the light.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.051
Move. Climb.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.084
(GRUNTING)

30:45.011 --> 30:46.721
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

31:05.614 --> 31:08.784
Inform the King.
Arthur has returned to Camelot!

31:14.915 --> 31:16.459
What're you doing?
Let me pass.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.128
I'm sorry, sire.
You are under arrest.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.465
-By order of the King.
-You disobeyed me.

31:22.757 --> 31:25.384
Of course, I did.
A man's life was at stake.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.803
Do not let Merlin die
because of something I did.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.556
Why do you care so much?
The boy's just a servant.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.892
He knew the danger
he was putting himself in,

31:32.975 --> 31:36.645
he knew what would happen if he drank
from that goblet, but he did it anyway.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.815
He saved my life.
There's more.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.152
There was a woman at the mountain.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.112
She knew I was there for the flower.

31:45.738 --> 31:48.240
| don't think it was Ba yard
who tried to poison me.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.825
Of course it was.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.792
Gaius knows what to do with it.

31:58.793 --> 32:01.837
Put me in the stocks for a week,
a month even, I don't care.

32:02.171 --> 32:05.674
Just make sure it gets to him.
I'm begging you.

32:10.179 --> 32:11.597
(YELLS) No!

32:12.348 --> 32:17.103
You have to learn, there is
a right and a wrong way of doing things.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.355
I'll see you're let out in a week.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.860
Then you can find yourself
another servant.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.468
(DOOR OPENING)

32:49.802 --> 32:52.304
He hasn't got much longer.
Has Arthur got the flower?

32:52.388 --> 32:55.057
| don't know.
Uther won't allow anyone to see him.

32:55.391 --> 32:56.559
(GROANING)

32:56.684 --> 32:57.977
Is there nothing we can do to help?

32:58.060 --> 33:00.729
Only the leaf of the Mortaeus Flower
can save him.

33:00.855 --> 33:03.149
Then we have to find out
if Arthur has it.

33:03.399 --> 33:07.319
-I could sneak in to the dungeon.
-That will be very dangerous.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.656
I've got to.
Merlin will die if I don't.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.242
(CONTINUES GROANING)

33:14.743 --> 33:15.870
Be careful.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.924
Food for the prisoner.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.231
Set it down over there.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.954
Thank you.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.754
Wait a minute.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.717
| couldn't possibly eat this,
it's disgusting.

34:13.886 --> 34:17.473
The state it's in,
I'm not sure it's fit for anyone.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.331
You. Wait.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.101
Waste not want not, eh?

35:02.184 --> 35:05.479
We're not all as precious
as Her Royal Highness.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.619
-Food for Prince Arthur.
-Stay where you are!

35:23.289 --> 35:24.540
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

35:24.623 --> 35:25.708
(DOOR OPENING)

35:26.041 --> 35:28.043
-How is he?
-Have you got the Mortaeus?

35:28.168 --> 35:29.295
Here.

35:29.378 --> 35:30.879
His breathing's much worse.
We have to hurry.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.731
-Why have you stopped?
-The poison was created using magic.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.525
We may need magic to make an antidote.

35:51.692 --> 35:55.738
But we can't.
It's forbidden, even if we could...

35:56.405 --> 35:58.991
I'll try and make it work without.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.077
Oh.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.204
| need some fresh water.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.555
(CHANTING)

36:45.412 --> 36:47.081
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

37:26.078 --> 37:27.454
Thank you.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.796
Hold his nose.

37:40.259 --> 37:43.929
Swallow, Merlin. Swallow it.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.817
GWEN: He's stopped breathing.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.320
What's happening? Gaius?

38:09.037 --> 38:10.998
His heart has stopped.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.505
He's dead?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.051
He can't be.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.181
He can't be.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.020
It was his destiny.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.522
It's my fault.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.526
If I'd have got here sooner,
if I'd have been quicker...

38:41.195 --> 38:42.404
No, no.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.699
It was me.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.998
| should've looked after him better.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.169
It's my fault.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.341
That's disgusting.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.426
You're old enough to be her grandfather.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.887
Merlin, you're alive.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.848
No, I'm a ghost come back to haunt you.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.771
Sorry. I'm just...
| thought you were dead.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.689
It's fine.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.276
It's more than fine.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.280
Um...

39:25.405 --> 39:26.949
What happened?

39:28.116 --> 39:30.285
The last thing I remember
is drinking the wine.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.041
Sire? Forgive the interruption,
but may I speak with you?

39:36.124 --> 39:39.127
-Not now.
-Your Highness, it is important.

39:39.253 --> 39:41.630
Word of Ba yard's arrest
has got back to Mercia.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.633
-We're about to be attacked.
- I fear that what I have to tell you

39:44.716 --> 39:49.304
may have some bearing on your plans.
Please, it will only take a moment.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.479
- I Know who tried to poison Arthur.
-So do |I.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.815
-He's locked in my dungeon.
-It wasn't Ba yard.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.567
The poison was magical

40:01.650 --> 40:04.945
and I'd recognize the hand
that made it anywhere.

40:07.656 --> 40:08.949
Nimueh.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.661
-You must be mistaken.
-I wish I was.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.247
It can't have been.
We'd know her.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.499
That witch's face is
not easily forgotten.

40:17.666 --> 40:21.753
She's a powerful sorceress, she can
enchant the eye that beholds her.

40:21.837 --> 40:25.007
-We never knew it was her.
-Have you any proof?

40:25.674 --> 40:29.928
The poison used against Merlin was made
more potent by the use of magic.

40:30.679 --> 40:33.348
You're saying that she
conspired with Ba yard to kill Arthur?

40:33.432 --> 40:37.102
No. Ba yard is innocent.
Look at what's happening.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.605
This is what she's wanted all along.

40:39.688 --> 40:43.025
A war to bring strife
and misery to Camelot.

40:43.859 --> 40:46.528
How long before
Ba yard's armies reach our walls?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.447
A day, maybe less.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.699
We should send our cavalry
out to meet them.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.957
Instruct your men not to leave
Camelot until I give the word.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.208
Sire.

41:02.461 --> 41:05.213
You're making the right decision, sire.

41:11.219 --> 41:15.057
Do you think Arthur should be
told the truth about Nimueh?

41:22.689 --> 41:27.569
Okay, let the bragging begin.
How did you manage it?

41:29.738 --> 41:31.239
I'm not sure.

41:33.033 --> 41:35.243
All I do know is I had help.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.040
Someone knew I was in trouble

41:41.541 --> 41:44.086
and sent a light to guide the way.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.256
-Who?
-I don't know.

41:50.342 --> 41:53.679
But whoever it was,
I'm only here because of them.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.266
I'm glad you're back.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.109
Arthur,

42:09.945 --> 42:14.616
the woman you met in the forest,
what did she tell you?

42:16.702 --> 42:20.956
Not much, she was too busy
trying to get me killed.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.920
-It was strange though.
-In what way?

42:30.132 --> 42:31.925
| was at her mercy.

42:32.134 --> 42:35.470
She could've finished me off
but she chose not to.

42:36.638 --> 42:39.933
She said it wasn't my destiny
to die at her hand.

42:44.396 --> 42:45.939
You must've been scared.

42:47.149 --> 42:48.984
It had its moments.

42:49.985 --> 42:52.487
Those who practice magic know only evil.

42:52.571 --> 42:56.658
They despise and seek to destroy
goodness wherever they find it.

42:57.659 --> 43:00.162
Which is why she wanted you dead.

43:01.830 --> 43:03.290
She is evil.

43:06.418 --> 43:08.670
It sounds as if you know her.

43:10.172 --> 43:11.339
| do.

43:15.969 --> 43:19.514
To know the heart of one sorcerer
is to know them all.

43:22.350 --> 43:26.271
You did the right thing,
even though you were disobeying me.

43:31.651 --> 43:35.405
I'm proud of you, Arthur.
Never forget that.

43:49.044 --> 43:50.712
Still alive then?

43:51.546 --> 43:53.381
Uh, yeah. Just about.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.929
| understand I have you
to thank for that.

43:59.888 --> 44:01.223
Yeah, well, it was nothing.

44:01.890 --> 44:04.684
A half-decent servant
is hard to come by.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.896
| was only dropping by
to make sure you were all right,

44:09.272 --> 44:11.483
check you'd be back to work tomorrow.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.110
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
Bright and early.

44:14.236 --> 44:15.403
Gaius.

44:17.781 --> 44:19.074
Arthur.

44:20.367 --> 44:21.743
Thank you.

44:23.954 --> 44:25.288
You, too.

44:27.791 --> 44:29.376
Get some rest.

44:34.756 --> 44:38.218
Arthur may give you a hard time,
but at heart, he is a man of honor.

44:38.301 --> 44:41.638
There aren't many who would've
risked what he did for a servant.

44:41.763 --> 44:42.931
It all would've been for nothing

44:43.056 --> 44:45.642
if you didn't know
how to make the antidote.

44:46.476 --> 44:48.144
Eat your dinner.

44:50.230 --> 44:53.650
| still don't understand why she went to
all the trouble of framing Ba yard?

44:53.775 --> 44:56.069
She could've just kept quiet
and killed Arthur.

44:56.653 --> 45:00.490
Destroying Arthur and Camelot
wasn't all she was after.

45:01.449 --> 45:04.077
She knew you would be forced
to drink that wine.

45:04.619 --> 45:07.122
It was you she wanted to Kill.

45:08.915 --> 45:12.627
It seems someone else knows you're
destined for great things, Merlin.

45:25.015 --> 45:27.142
MERLIN:
| owe Lancelot my life.

45:27.267 --> 45:30.437
| am paying for that debt
the only way I can.

45:30.645 --> 45:34.107
It's my life's ambition
to join the knights of Camelot.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.943
Arise, Sir Lancelot.

45:37.027 --> 45:38.987
-If I should not return...
-Don't go, Lancelot.

45:42.657 --> 45:45.160
Okay, Merlin.
It's now or never.
