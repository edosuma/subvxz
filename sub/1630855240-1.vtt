- Jean won't let you
screw anything up.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.328
You haven't been
sworn in, have you?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.199
- No.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.331
- Judge, I'm gonna need you
to do that for me, please.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.376
- Oh, I'd be glad to.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.336
Jean, can you get me
a bible up in here?

22:22.253 --> 22:24.125
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

22:24.168 --> 22:27.433
Okay, you raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.826
All right. Jay Johnson.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.437
- Where's Officer Mercer?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.177
- Called in sick.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.396
- What about Smith?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.180
- Fired him two weeks ago.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.140
- Get whoever we have outside
to handle the overflow.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.142
- Are you seeing what I'm
seeing? They're grouping up.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.100
- I know. Get Elton out here.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.364
Have him wrangle some. You
stay on top of the rest.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.843
- You want us to
wrangle by color, right?

22:46.887 --> 22:48.236
I can have Elton take
care of his people

22:48.279 --> 22:49.498
and then I take-

22:49.542 --> 22:51.282
- I need you to
do what I ask you

22:51.326 --> 22:52.153
to do without a whole
lot of commentary.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.023
How about that?

22:53.067 --> 22:53.894
- All right.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.419
- Let me help you with that.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.333
- Thank you.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.552
- Nervous?

22:59.595 --> 23:03.077
Oh, don't be, you got this.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.559
- There you go.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.995
You look great.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.563
I love it. How do you feel?

23:10.606 --> 23:11.955
- Ah, good.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.522
- Great.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.394
So you're comfortable
with the procedure? Yeah?

23:15.437 --> 23:16.873
- I have it. I do.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.527
Looked at those
other courts to, um,

23:18.571 --> 23:20.311
not only to make sure
I knew how it was done,

23:20.355 --> 23:22.226
but also to assess
different approaches.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.054
- Judge, I'd love to hear
all about it another time.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.927
Right now we gotta plea
them and street them. Okay?

23:26.970 --> 23:31.148
Rule on all of the small
no contest, and guilties.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.063
And then send the
more complicated ones,

23:33.107 --> 23:37.546
mostly domestic violence for
pre-sentencing evaluation.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.374
Okay?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.897
Now judge, of course you
can do is you please.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.944
But that's just the flow
of things here, okay?

23:45.206 --> 23:46.207
All right, let's go.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.908
[Jay breathes deeply]

24:01.352 --> 24:04.617
- All rise for the
honorable Judge Jay Johnson.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.063
- Shit!

24:20.546 --> 24:23.505
[Jay clears throat]

24:31.382 --> 24:32.209
Uh oh.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.650
- Judge please.

24:37.693 --> 24:40.653
Seven, pound, red, seven, blue.

24:42.742 --> 24:43.699
Got it?

24:43.743 --> 24:44.526
[Jay clicks tongue]

24:44.570 --> 24:46.354
- Good.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.573
Cause I can't be up here
all day trying to figure out

24:47.616 --> 24:49.052
what's wrong with the
button you pushed.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.664
Let's start on an easy one.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.625
- Thank you.

24:56.669 --> 25:00.586
- Case number 645273.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.544
Alison Baker.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.292
- Ms. Alison Baker,

25:11.335 --> 25:13.642
you've been charged with driving
while under the influence.

25:15.426 --> 25:20.431
Sorry.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.479
[Jay gulps]

25:27.264 --> 25:29.005
Ms. Allison Baker,

25:29.049 --> 25:31.051
you've been charged with driving
while under the influence.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.705
It is a first degree
misdemeanor punishable

25:32.748 --> 25:36.273
by a maximum of six months
in jail and a $1,000 fine.

25:36.317 --> 25:37.623
Do you understand the
nature of the charges?

25:37.666 --> 25:39.668
- I do.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.583
- Judge. We'd like to
enter a plea of not guilty.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.629
- Good. I'll accept that plea.

25:43.672 --> 25:47.720
- Judge, we're two months
out on pre-trial dates.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.592
- Does counsel waive time?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.072
- Indeed, we do, your honor.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.682
- Great.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.424
Step over to the deputy
clerk and get your date.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.688
Next?

25:59.732 --> 26:01.255
- [Man] How'd you get
your phone in here?

26:01.298 --> 26:02.735
- You better watch
your damn mouth.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.563
Why the fuck you
worried about my phone?

26:04.606 --> 26:05.476
Mind your business.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.391
- Judge.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.655
You need to say something to
threaten them with contempt.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.091
Something.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.223
Whatever you say, sell it.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.270
I only have one officer here
and he's with the prisoner.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.358
- What you want to do?

26:17.401 --> 26:18.533
- You know what?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.186
- What the fuck you want to do?

26:19.229 --> 26:19.665
- Hey.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.799
- Hey, you in the back!

26:23.843 --> 26:25.366
I don't wanna hear another word

26:25.409 --> 26:27.324
coming from either one of you

26:27.368 --> 26:29.675
unless you're answering a
question from me or my staff.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.415
And the next word that
comes outta your mouth

26:31.459 --> 26:32.808
will send you straight to jail.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.331
You got that?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.159
Lemme see, you
nod, emphatically.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.207
- Nicely done.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.122
You have kids?

26:42.165 --> 26:44.864
- No, but I got a whole ass
family that acts like that.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.780
- All right. Case number 6547...

26:47.823 --> 26:51.653
[bass heavy hip-hop music]

27:06.712 --> 27:08.278
- Yo. Dre, get your boy, man.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.673
How many times you
gonna text her?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.196
- Til I catch her.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.676
- Mad thirsty, my n####.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.547
- n####, how's that thirsty?

27:16.591 --> 27:17.810
This is a woman you keep.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.116
Something you wouldn't
know nothing about.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.423
- See? Least you got
somebody to text.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.729
n####, you ain't got
no hoes in your phone.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.861
- No bitches.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.689
- I got five, six bitches
I could call right now.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.517
Both of your mamas included.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.824
- I bet none of 'em answer
for your ass either.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.304
- All right, all right.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.828
I ain't got no
bitches, all right.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.351
But at least I ain't
sending up hella texts

27:37.394 --> 27:39.527
to a woman who ain't
sending back no bubbles.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.877
- n####, she out there doing
something new and deep, man.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.618
She need to know what
I'm here for her.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.273
- But you-

27:46.316 --> 27:46.839
- Got a woman you couldn't
get anywhere near.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.928
- That's a fact.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.843
- You handle your business
and I'll handle mine.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.715
- Yeah. All right, n####.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.499
- Get your man some
bitches. He hurtin'.

man allergic to bitches.

had to sit across from me.

28:11.951 --> 28:12.734
- [Black Man] I can sit
wherever the fuck I want.

28:12.778 --> 28:13.735
- [Jay] Ay!

28:13.779 --> 28:15.258
What did I say?

28:15.302 --> 28:17.521
The next person that I
hear talking out of turn

28:17.565 --> 28:18.784
will go straight to jail.

28:20.611 --> 28:21.482
You got that?

28:23.658 --> 28:24.877
- Hey, you got your phone?

28:24.920 --> 28:28.358
- I got it. Send out
a text, see who's up.

28:28.402 --> 28:29.882
- Oh, so you got your phone?

28:29.925 --> 28:30.752
- And?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.319
- Judge,

28:32.362 --> 28:33.494
we've gotta get this
guy in the box next

28:33.537 --> 28:34.930
and free up that officer, okay?

28:34.974 --> 28:35.801
- Okay.

28:36.845 --> 28:40.806
- Case number 5467S18.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.288
- The heck happened to you?

28:46.333 --> 28:47.377
Has he seen a doctor?

28:47.421 --> 28:48.988
- He's fine, your Honor.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.903
Looks worse than it is.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.296
- Judge. All I wanted
to do was talk to her.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.907
- We'll get to that.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.648
But what I wanna know first is
do you need to see a doctor?

28:57.692 --> 28:59.259
- I'm fine.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.913
This is all a big mistake.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.828
- You've been charged
with resisting arrest,

29:02.871 --> 29:05.656
aggravated menacing, stalking,
and domestic violence.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.920
All charges are first
degree misdemeanors,

29:07.963 --> 29:10.836
each punishable by a maximum
of six months in jail

29:10.879 --> 29:12.881
and a $1,000 fine.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.579
- Uh. Your Honor, my client
wishes to plead no contest

29:15.623 --> 29:17.190
with an opportunity to be heard.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.802
- I'll accept your plea of no
contest to all of the charges.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.412
Mr. Prosecutor,

29:22.456 --> 29:23.979
can I have a recitation
of the underlying facts

29:24.023 --> 29:24.893
supporting the charges?

29:26.634 --> 29:28.679
- Mr. Anderson was
tapping on the glass

29:28.723 --> 29:32.727
at Bo's Cajun Bistro and
entered the premises.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.946
- And?

29:33.989 --> 29:34.860
- Well, that's it.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.820
- Ask for the police report.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.996
- Just read me what you
have on the police report.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.868
- The owners call the police

29:42.911 --> 29:45.522
and Mr. Anderson
resisted arrest.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.961
- And what does the police
report say about the resisting?

29:49.004 --> 29:51.528
- Well, it's a big brief.

29:57.404 --> 29:58.318
- Back the fuck up!

29:59.841 --> 30:00.842
- You know you got
a smart ass mouth.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.278
- Fuck that supposed to mean?

30:02.322 --> 30:03.453
- You know what it means.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.807
- That's it? It just says
resisted, no explanation.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.939
Do you have Mr.
Anderson's arrest record?

30:10.983 --> 30:14.987
- Your Honor, we have 75
people to arrange this morning.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.466
I can't-

30:16.510 --> 30:17.685
- So what am I
supposed to do here?

30:17.728 --> 30:19.469
Hmm?

30:19.513 --> 30:21.341
- This man have a history
of bothering women.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.821
- I didn't know
those other women,

30:24.474 --> 30:25.911
but Beth and I are married.

30:25.954 --> 30:29.044
- They're not, he's confused.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.959
- So let me get this straight.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.788
So what you were
saying to me is that

30:33.832 --> 30:38.445
they were not in any kind of
intimate relationship at all.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.316
- No, your Honor.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.666
- So then why are you charging
him with domestic violence?

30:42.710 --> 30:47.062
- Well, that one may have
been a bit of a stretch,

30:47.106 --> 30:49.935
but I'm willing to
dismiss that charge.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.372
- Help me out here, Mr.
Prosecutor, what are we doing?

30:52.415 --> 30:53.982
- Look, your honor,

30:54.026 --> 30:56.898
I thought I had a judge that
that knew something about-

30:56.942 --> 30:59.118
- Is one of the
arresting officers here?

30:59.161 --> 31:02.077
Is the complaining
witness here? Anything?

31:02.121 --> 31:03.905
- [Prosecutor] Uh. No.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.865
Ms. Myers didn't have time
to come to court today, so...

31:06.908 --> 31:09.737
but this guy has a
mental health issue.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.521
He's a constant menace.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.784
Police get called
on him all the time.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.569
- I can't just take
your word for it

31:15.612 --> 31:17.876
and convict him for
everything you charged him

31:17.919 --> 31:20.095
and completely ignore the
fact that you can't even

31:20.139 --> 31:21.967
articulate any
evidence to support it.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.403
- Why don't you just
hand it over, man?

31:23.446 --> 31:24.839
What is your problem?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.536
- Y'all need to back up.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.061
- Come on guys.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.801
- Get your hands off me, man.

31:30.845 --> 31:31.802
[cymbal crashes]

31:31.846 --> 31:35.502
[angry hip-hop music]

31:35.545 --> 31:38.722
[men grunting]

31:38.766 --> 31:41.725
- You've pled guilty to all
the charges, Mr. Anderson?

31:41.769 --> 31:45.120
Now I have to take the
prosecutor's word as to what

31:45.164 --> 31:49.037
occurred. And if I do, then
what he stated is the basis

31:49.081 --> 31:51.518
for a loitering charge.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.041
I can imagine that
we have enough

31:53.085 --> 31:54.564
for the disorderly
conduct as well.

31:54.608 --> 31:57.045
- The city dismisses the rest.

31:57.089 --> 32:01.441
But we ask that a protection
order on behalf of Ms. Meyers,

32:01.484 --> 32:04.923
be part of any
probationary conditions.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.056
