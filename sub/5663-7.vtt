40:30.637 --> 40:33.549
It took me years to mourn his loss.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.929
Now I have to do it all over again.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.219
I spoke to the ER.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.264
Sounds like Levi's gonna make it.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.394
Seems like a good guy.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.519
He is.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.658
I mean, this place, this job, it's--

40:54.243 --> 40:57.986
After Audrey died,
I came to work the very next day.

40:59.749 --> 41:04.413
It's so easy to lose perspective,
forget what really matters.

41:07.507 --> 41:08.713
Are you okay?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.842
I'm not so sure.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.306
What really matters is this.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.020
Here.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.817
Now.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.987
Nothing else is guaranteed.
