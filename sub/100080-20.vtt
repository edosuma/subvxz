Beau jumped bail last
night in San Jose

12:25.570 --> 12:28.225

up the bar where she worked.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.093
split the spoils two waysinstead of three.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.095
So they come to L.A. to
unload the chess pieces.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.967
They obviously don't count

14:30.652 --> 14:32.088
What's that got

14:32.132 --> 14:33.829
The deputy mayor's tryingto get me to back down,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875

15:50.819 --> 15:52.386
Why? Did they do this?

15:52.429 --> 15:53.865
They had to have been
looking for the chess pieces.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.650
When they didn't find them...They went to the marina.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.565

the chess pieces?No, that couple.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.221

16:01.264 --> 16:02.613
About an hour ago,
two guys came in,

16:02.657 --> 16:05.007
showed me a picture of the two,just like you did.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.008

16:06.052 --> 16:07.270
Wh-What guys?
Who were they?

16:07.314 --> 16:09.142
I don't know. They flashedbadges of some sort.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.317
Figured they were cops.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.494

the two guys

16:19.282 --> 16:20.762
nosing around
Bobby Reese's hotel?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.068

about the burglary.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.289

up in San Francisco.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.297

She has to be
playing him, right?

16:40.782 --> 16:42.305
I mean, she gets close
to the tech wiz,

16:42.349 --> 16:44.307
gets access to his apartment
so her boyfriend

16:44.351 --> 16:45.700
and buddies can rip the guy off.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.049
Okay, but we've been
playing this like

16:47.093 --> 16:48.746

girl tagging along

16:48.790 --> 16:49.965

20:37.845 --> 20:40.151
Beau's a wanted murderer.You guys are in over your heads.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.110
It's time for you to letlaw enforcement handle it.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.720
We are law enforcement.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.505
U.S. Supreme
Court said so.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.202
Taylor v. Taintor.DEACON: Taylor v. Taintor?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.291
That-- it's 150 years old.
It's from the Old West.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.119
It's still precedent.We train for this every day.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.294
We will bring him in.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.078
You bring him in,
we don't get paid.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.732
I'm a single parent.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.995
Husband walked out when I was onmy second tour in Afghanistan,

20:58.039 --> 21:00.476
got two kidslooking at college.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.435
50 grand? It's a big deal.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.219
We can't walk
away from it.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.397
Now, if we can get
our weapons back, please?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.053
Come on.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.794
[sighs]

21:13.837 --> 21:15.317
Best stay out of our way.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.319
Best stay out of ours.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.365
[phone vibrating]

21:22.193 --> 21:24.195
Yeah, Pop?

21:24.239 --> 21:26.023
Hey, listen, I've been
trying to reach Darryl,

21:26.067 --> 21:27.895
but he ain't returning
my texts or phone calls.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.157
Well, you can guess why,
can't you?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.680
Heema and Deon are still there?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.421
Has he reached out
to her parents yet?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.162
Well, what do you think?

21:35.468 --> 21:39.385
Hondo, he having
such a great time.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.951
Why ruin it?

21:40.995 --> 21:43.040
I mean, courts move
so slow these days.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.564
This may be
the only chance he gets

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
to spend with his son
for a long while.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.567
Pop, if he doesn't
play this right, it might be

21:47.610 --> 21:49.699
the only chance he ever gets.I'm just saying,

21:49.743 --> 21:52.441
I'm not gonna be the oneto break up this pretty picture.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.356
That's gonna have
to be on you, son.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.620
All right, look... just havehim call me as soon as he can.

21:57.664 --> 21:58.969
Everything all right?

22:00.014 --> 22:01.494
It's Darryl.

22:01.537 --> 22:04.366
He's 17, but he's navigating
adult territory now,

22:04.410 --> 22:05.846
going into this custody suit.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.456
So you're stuckbetween treating him like a boy

22:07.500 --> 22:09.371
and treating him like a man.[laughs softly]

22:09.415 --> 22:11.155
Look, he's got to learn
from his mistakes,

22:11.199 --> 22:13.419
but if he's about
to drive off a cliff...

22:13.462 --> 22:15.508
I got to step in.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.858
Yeah, I know.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.384
What are you doing here, Richie?

22:22.428 --> 22:24.168
Huh?

22:24.212 --> 22:25.953
I don't know
what kind of aspirations

22:25.996 --> 22:28.564
you had for yourself,
but it couldn't have involved

22:28.608 --> 22:29.913
sitting in
an interrogation room,

22:29.957 --> 22:31.959
fearing for your life
because your best buddy

22:32.002 --> 22:33.395
and his girlfriend
want to kill you.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.136
TAN:
They got Bobby. You
know that, right?

22:35.179 --> 22:36.529
He's dead.

22:36.572 --> 22:37.747
Guess maybe now
you're regretting

22:37.791 --> 22:40.446
how you tried to
screw 'em over.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.535
Hold on. They're the ones
who tried to screw us over.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.101
HICKS:
I miss something?

22:44.145 --> 22:45.538
You and Bobby took
the stolen chess pieces,

22:45.581 --> 22:47.409
came to L.A. to cash in.Yeah, sounds a lot like

22:47.453 --> 22:49.150
you two were the screwers,
not the screwees.

22:49.193 --> 22:52.414
That's only because they plannedto rip us off first.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.851
That bitch Harper,
she lied to us,

22:54.895 --> 22:57.637
told us that the chess pieceswere only worth a hundred grand.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.857
Acted like it was generous,cutting us in for $25K each.

23:00.901 --> 23:03.599
Only later, whenthe whole thing hit the news,

23:03.643 --> 23:06.123
did me and Bobby realize
they were worth millions.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.342
So you flipped
the tables on 'em.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.389
Where are the chess pieces now?

23:10.432 --> 23:11.607
[sighs]

23:11.651 --> 23:12.869
I hate to break it
to you, Richie,

23:12.913 --> 23:14.436
but you're not
in the game anymore.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.872
So either you tell
us and we get them,

23:15.916 --> 23:18.092
or Beau and Harper
are gonna get them.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.400
Which would you
rather? Huh?

23:23.663 --> 23:25.186
They're with a guy.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.667
His name's Arthur.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.234
He got some shop where
he resells rich people stuff.

23:30.278 --> 23:33.237
You know, handles estate sales,that kind of crap.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.239
He was finding us a buyer.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.459
And where'd you and Bobby
find this guy, Arthur?

23:37.503 --> 23:40.288
We just asked around, you know,put the word on the street.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.116
If word's on the street...There's nothing to stop

23:42.159 --> 23:44.379
Beau and Harper
from finding Arthur, too.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.382
[bell chimes]

23:51.952 --> 23:53.910
You two looking for
anything in particular?

23:53.954 --> 23:55.434
I'm happy to point you
in the right direction.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.609
Uh, actually,
we're looking for Arthur.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.524
Oh, I'm sorry. Arthur's
out at an estate

23:58.567 --> 24:00.482
doing an appraisal right now.
It usually takes a few hours.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.050
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
Uh, why don't you tell us

24:03.093 --> 24:05.269
where the estate is,
and we'll go to Arthur.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.357
I'm afraid I can't do that.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.577
It's really important.I understand,

24:08.621 --> 24:11.362
but we have policies about
client confidentiality.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.581
You have policies.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.714
What's your policy on, uh,

24:14.757 --> 24:17.151
getting your whole damn shop
destroyed?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.981
Where's Arthur?!GUARD:Hey!

24:21.024 --> 24:22.417
What the helldo you think you're doing?

24:22.461 --> 24:23.592
Somebody needs to tell
me where Arthur is

24:23.636 --> 24:26.116
right now,or someone can die!

24:26.160 --> 24:27.596
Man, I don't know, I swear.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.771
[alarm sounding]

24:32.383 --> 24:33.776

24:36.387 --> 24:37.606
7310, that's wherewe're headed.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.781
It's just around
the corner.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.043
Bonnie and Clydebeat us to it.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.177

[tires screeching]

25:16.384 --> 25:17.428
What the hellare they doing?

25:23.391 --> 25:25.045
It's the bounty hunters.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.655
[horns honk, tires screech]

25:26.699 --> 25:28.135
Are you kidding me?

25:42.802 --> 25:46.327
[horns honking]

26:03.474 --> 26:06.216

we're discontinuing pursuit

You good?I'm fine.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.268
Help's coming.Hey.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.270
Hey, hey, hey. Don't move.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.011
Help's coming.HONDO: Hey, come on.Wake up, man.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.403
Wake up.Is he okay?

26:20.491 --> 26:21.623
He's alive.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.885
You got to keep pressureon his wound

26:22.929 --> 26:24.495
until the paramedics arrive.Right here.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.280
I'm sorry.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.587
We're on the same side.
You know that.

26:31.328 --> 26:34.070
That was our chanceto get those two beforeanyone else gets hurt.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.506
It's too late for that.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.857
They just left another dead bodyat the resale shop.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.823
The house belongs to ourhigh-end fence Arthur Tenney.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.303
If he still has
the chess pieces,

26:49.346 --> 26:50.826
Beau and Harper
will come for him.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.654
If they haven't already.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.443
[doorbell rings]

27:01.010 --> 27:02.490
We sure he's here?

27:02.533 --> 27:03.665
He was doing an appraisal
in Beverly Hills

27:03.709 --> 27:04.797
and then disappeared.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.233
He's not answering his phone.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.843
All right, let'sdo a welfare check.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.628
Deacon, Chris, take
the three side. Street, Tan,

27:09.671 --> 27:11.238
we're going through the front.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.718
Digital dead bolt.
You bring your master key?

27:12.761 --> 27:14.589
Never leave home without it.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.338
Arthur Tenney! LAPD!

27:24.381 --> 27:25.382
Are you here?

27:27.558 --> 27:29.604
Tan. Go.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.868
Arthur Tenney!

27:35.915 --> 27:38.308
Coffee's fresh.
Someone's close by.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.397
Give me two.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.313
Two, two, two.Right side clear.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.273
Give me two.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.929
No sign of Arthur
or the chess pieces.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.321
Clear.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.367
Something ain't right.What are you thinking?

27:53.410 --> 27:55.761
The floor plan
and the architecture.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.850
There's a dead space back here.

27:57.893 --> 27:59.895
[knocking on wall]

28:02.724 --> 28:05.553
He's got a panic room.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.425
LAPD! Arthur Tenney!

28:08.469 --> 28:10.645
I need you to openthe door and come out!

28:10.689 --> 28:12.212
Come on, now,
Mr. Tenney.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.040
If you don't open up, we'regonna have to blow the door.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.824
All right.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.434
We're rigging the door.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.784
[quietly]:
Chris.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.699
DEACON:
These aren't
small explosives!

28:20.742 --> 28:21.700
I hope you can stand

28:21.743 --> 28:23.179
far enough back!

28:23.223 --> 28:25.921
ARTHUR:
Wait! I'll open.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.364
Where's the chess pieces?

28:36.453 --> 28:39.587
This is what it's all about?
Ridiculous.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.589
Can't believe these things
are over a thousand years old.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.199
Chess pieces recovered.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.461
Arthur Tenney's
in protective custody.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.202
Doesn't meanthe city's safe.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.465
Wilshire Divisionjust responded to a carjacking.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.990
Mother of two shot in the leg
for her Lexus.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.427
Suspects' descriptionsmatch Beau and Harper.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.907
They don't know
we have the pieces,

28:54.950 --> 28:56.735
so they're not gonna stop.We could go public.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.475
We do and they'll just vanish.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.739
We have what they're afterright here.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.002
So, how do we lure 'em in?

29:03.045 --> 29:05.004
I may have an idea.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.049
But you're not gonna like it.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.320
How's your partner?He's in surgery

29:17.364 --> 29:19.105
to remove the bullet,
but he's gonna make it.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.585
But you're not hereto check on him, are you?No.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.457
I'm here because
I need your help

29:23.500 --> 29:24.632
to get Harper and
Beau off the street

29:24.675 --> 29:26.112
before they hurt
somebody else.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.374
Thing is,

29:27.417 --> 29:28.723
there's nothing in it for you.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.593
[scoffs]

29:30.681 --> 29:31.987
What's your play?

29:32.031 --> 29:33.336
We recovered the
chess pieces,

29:33.380 --> 29:34.816
only Beau and Harper
don't know that.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.383
So we pretend that
you recovered them.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.733
Post photos to
Harper's social media,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.343
see if she's willing
to make a trade.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.345
"The chess pieces
for your fugitive Beau."

29:42.389 --> 29:43.651
You think she'd really
give up her boyfriend?

29:43.694 --> 29:45.348
DEACON: I don't know,
but I'm betting

29:45.392 --> 29:46.741
that she'll agree to the meet.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.657
Whether it's to hand over Beau
or to ambush you.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.094
And we end upwith what, nothing?

29:53.182 --> 29:54.836
No way. I'm out.

29:56.403 --> 30:00.015
Look, I wish that I had
something better to offer.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.843
But these two,
they shot your partner.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.845
And I don't know a
better way to stop them

30:03.889 --> 30:06.065
before they hurt or kill
somebody else.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.371
I'm not a mercenary, you know?

30:08.415 --> 30:13.159
Being a bounty hunter feeds myfamily, but it's more than that.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.204
I see myself as one
of the good guys.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.945
So you'll do it?

30:16.989 --> 30:18.425
Yeah.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.818
Obviously
there are risks involved.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.473
You forget I was a Marine?

30:25.258 --> 30:27.042
Gemma posted almost an hour ago.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.609
20-David and 40-David
teams are ready

30:28.652 --> 30:30.524
as soon as we get a response.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.092
I always hate the calm
before the storm.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.529
Yeah.All right. Keep me posted.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.448
Dude, what's that about?

30:41.491 --> 30:43.102
Oh, nothing, man.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.627
You know you got
a crap poker face, right?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.107
What's up?

30:48.150 --> 30:50.805
I've been helping Kellywith her lines

30:50.849 --> 30:53.460
so she could try outfor a play.Mm-hmm.

30:53.503 --> 30:54.678
She didn't get the part.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.898
Okay. I mean,
she's 12.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.901
She'll bounce back.It's not that,not exactly.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.511
Look, she was havingsecond thoughts

31:01.555 --> 31:02.773
about auditioning,

31:02.817 --> 31:05.254
so I kind of pushed herinto facing her fears.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.561
Only the deal was,I had to face mine, too.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.564
So I set up the three-mile run.It's tonight.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.087
That's great. Dude!

31:12.131 --> 31:13.610
[chuckles] You know we've been
dying to have you back.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.309
Yeah, but wh-what ifI strike out like she did?

31:16.352 --> 31:18.093
You won't, man.
Hey,

31:18.137 --> 31:19.921
you have already run
it on your own

31:19.965 --> 31:21.618
and beat the time.
You've done all the prep.

31:21.662 --> 31:24.230
You are ready.I thought Kellywas ready, too.

31:24.273 --> 31:25.579
Are you really
comparing this

31:25.622 --> 31:27.581
to a little kid auditioning
for a school play?

31:27.624 --> 31:29.670
Look, all it would take is forone little thing to go wrong.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.673
If I twist an ankle?
What if my hip acts up again?

31:32.716 --> 31:34.457
It's not a lock.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.546
Nothing's ever a lock.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.679
I know.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.550
But the day I failmy three-mile run

31:40.594 --> 31:43.727
is my last day on SWAT.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.601
It's not gonna be today.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.169
I'm gonna tell Hicksto hold off.

31:50.212 --> 31:51.997
If you're gonna tell him,
you'd better tell him quick.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.737
Gemma just set a meet.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.572
Suspect One is headedfor the meet.

32:20.895 --> 32:21.983
How's this gonna work?

32:22.027 --> 32:23.724
Simple.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.595
You give up Beau so I canhaul him back to San Jose

32:25.639 --> 32:27.380
for the 50 grandrecovery fee.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.599
In return, you getwhat you want.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.736
There's only one
piece in here.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.564
Where are the others?Where's Beau?

32:37.607 --> 32:39.305
He's sitting in
our hotel room.

32:39.348 --> 32:42.482
You get me the other pieces,
I'll tell you the room number.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.092
Hell, I'll even
give you the key.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.095
Think she's reallyburning him?

32:47.139 --> 32:48.879
Not sure.HONDO: Which means
he could be close.

32:48.923 --> 32:49.968
Keep your eyes open.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.273
CHRIS:
24-David.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.535
Possible eyes on Suspect Two,

32:52.579 --> 32:53.710
parking lot, northwest corner.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.974
Next to a gray truck.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.019
HONDO:
Positive ID on Suspect Two.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.542
40-Squad, you handle
Suspect One.

32:59.586 --> 33:00.587
20-Squad,
we got Beau.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.719
Tan, cover me
from the back.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.810
Bail enforcement agent.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.812
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.728
LAPD SWAT!

33:11.772 --> 33:13.078
[grunts]

33:13.121 --> 33:14.296
HONDO:
Forget it, Beau, you
ain't going nowhere.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.689
Put the gun down now.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.734
No way, I'm never
going down like this.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.307
Back off, you hear me? Back offor I'll put a bullet

33:25.351 --> 33:26.439
in this guy.You shoot him,
I shoot you.

33:26.482 --> 33:27.527
Sounds likea sweet deal.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.703
I don't have a shot, Hondo.

33:29.746 --> 33:30.617
HARPER:Beau!

33:32.619 --> 33:34.838
HONDO:
Come on, now, Beau.

33:34.882 --> 33:35.970
The romance is over.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.754
Whatever you think
you feel for her,

33:37.798 --> 33:38.625
it ain't worth dying over.

33:38.668 --> 33:39.887
Stop! Out
of the car!

33:39.930 --> 33:41.236
Out of the car now!

33:41.280 --> 33:43.412
Okay, okay, okay, okay!Out!

33:43.456 --> 33:44.848
Aah!

33:45.849 --> 33:47.721
LAPD!

33:50.593 --> 33:52.726
STREET:
Stop the car!

34:04.651 --> 34:07.088
This is 20-David.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.396
Code 4.
Suspect down.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.838
[engine starts]

34:24.497 --> 34:27.326
Hey, I didn't know that
Keith followed me. I swear.

34:27.369 --> 34:31.069
I believe you.I don't suppose
I can keep that.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.420
I'm afraidthe only reward

34:34.463 --> 34:36.335
on this oneis our gratitude.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.077
Thank you.Sure thing.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.868
Officer Alonso,
do you have a minute?

34:47.911 --> 34:49.870
I asked the deputy mayorto come down so we could discuss

34:49.913 --> 34:50.784
some sort of resolution.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.787
[sighs]

34:53.830 --> 34:55.832
You know what?
Let's just-- let's go in here,

34:55.876 --> 34:57.138
it'll be quieter.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.575
Admittedly, Officer Alonsomay have acted rashly,

34:59.619 --> 35:02.012
confronting youat City Hall.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.102
But she has
a genuine concern.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.538
Unless someone
intervenes,

35:05.581 --> 35:07.148
your son's gonna kill
himself or someone else.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.802
My son has a problem.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.020
And we're dealing with it.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.370
But you're notdealing with it.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.458
You're just enabling him.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.416
Chris did some checking.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.244
She foundthree other instances

35:16.288 --> 35:17.593
where your son was arrestedfor DUI,

35:17.637 --> 35:19.465
and you made the chargesall disappear.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.119
You're not helping him.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.598
Wait-wait a minute.

35:22.642 --> 35:23.860
What the hell isthis?

35:23.904 --> 35:26.124
I came down here
because youtold me

35:26.167 --> 35:29.083
Officer Alonso wanted
to apologize.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.650
How long do you thinkyou can keep covering up

35:30.693 --> 35:32.304
for your son's drinkingand driving?

35:32.347 --> 35:35.002
For as long as I want.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.265
I'm deputy mayor of this city.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.615
And that comes
with certain perks

35:39.659 --> 35:41.226
and privileges.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.317
And if you don't like it,
well, that's just too damn bad.

35:46.535 --> 35:47.797
LYNCH:
It's funny.

35:47.841 --> 35:51.410
As a city official whooversees this department,

35:51.453 --> 35:54.282
you don't know muchabout police work, do you?

35:54.326 --> 35:57.242
Everything that happens
in an LAPD interrogation room

35:57.285 --> 35:58.634
is recorded from the moment

35:58.678 --> 36:00.462
that door opens.

36:00.506 --> 36:04.205
So... you've recorded me?

36:04.249 --> 36:06.338
Without my consent?

36:06.381 --> 36:08.992
[chuckles]
Who's ignorant now?

36:09.036 --> 36:11.821
Nothing I said
is admissible.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.127
No, not in court.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.173
But I have somevery close friends in the press,

36:15.216 --> 36:17.436
and I guarantee that won't bean issue for them.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.787
You and your son have hadall the second chances

36:20.830 --> 36:22.441
you're gonna get.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.399
You need to make this right.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.622
Luca!

36:29.665 --> 36:30.710
Hey. What are youdoing here?

36:30.753 --> 36:32.364
She wanted to thank you.

36:32.407 --> 36:35.236
Yeah. I baked you
some cookies.Thank me?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.369
But I thoughtyou didn't get the part?I didn't.

36:37.412 --> 36:41.547
It went to this other girl.
She's really good, right?

36:41.590 --> 36:43.766
You're not upset?I'm just glad
I did it.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.334
I remembered all my words
and I didn't mess up.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.770
[chuckles]TUANA: Her teacher said
she did great.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.859
Kelly's just not ready
for the lead role yet.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.166
She got a smallerpart, though.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.865
What? That's amazing, man.Good for you.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.519
So, what about our deal?Did you do the fitness test yet?

36:57.563 --> 37:01.741
I was going to, butit didn't work out for today.

37:01.784 --> 37:05.092
Well, you'll do it soon.
I know you will.

37:07.747 --> 37:10.793
I might need your help
with that, actually.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.192
[door closes]Look, Hondo, I was gonnacall earlier.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.454
I-I swear I was,

37:19.498 --> 37:20.847
but I can't standthe thought of Deon leaving.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.197
That's my boy.Come on.HONDO: I know.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.807
That's why Imade the call.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.724
Dad, this wasn't Darryl's idea.

37:28.768 --> 37:29.769
CURTIS:
How could you do this?

37:29.812 --> 37:32.380
Take Deon and
disappear like that?

37:32.424 --> 37:33.729
Your mother's
been terrified.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.557
Put us through all
that to spend time

37:35.601 --> 37:37.385
with this low-life?Okay, now wait a minute,hold on.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.692
You are not gonnacome in my home

37:39.735 --> 37:40.693
and start insulting Darryl.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.129
No, it's all right.It's okay.

37:42.172 --> 37:43.739
Look, I understandwhy you don't like me.

37:43.783 --> 37:46.481
I didn't like me two years ago,and that's what you know me for.

37:46.525 --> 37:49.658
But I changed.I'm, I'm working more.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.313
I-I'm doing good in school...I got a future.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.359
I'm really not interested
in your story.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.623
Get Deon out to
the car right now.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.451
I'm takingyou both home.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.287
Sir, you're upset becauseHeema wanted little Deon

38:09.330 --> 38:10.462
to meet his father?

38:10.505 --> 38:11.811
That's what you're
angry about?

38:11.854 --> 38:13.900
CURTIS:
Getting Heema
pregnant at 15

38:13.943 --> 38:16.555
does not make
Darryl a father.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.904
He's got no place
in Deon's life,

38:17.947 --> 38:19.514
as far as my wife
and I are concerned.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.124
Darryl is a
good kid now.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.909
He deserves a
second chance.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.650
And I'm talkingto lawyers;

38:24.693 --> 38:26.869
I'm doing everything I canto be a father in my son's life.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.437
That's not ever gonna happen.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.569
Well, I'm 17right now,

38:30.612 --> 38:32.222
and that gives youthe power over me,

38:32.266 --> 38:33.659
but when I turn 18,
my lawyer said

38:33.702 --> 38:35.356
that's when the law
turns in my favor!

38:35.400 --> 38:38.838
I'm gonna be in my son's life![door slams]

38:52.286 --> 38:53.461
TAN:So, what'sthe word, Street?

38:53.505 --> 38:55.376
Beers at you and Luca'splace tonight?

38:55.420 --> 38:57.073
CHRIS:
You're not hurrying home
to your new fiancée?

38:57.117 --> 38:58.640
That's not a good sign.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.425
TAN:
Bonnie's got to work late,
and I got nowhere to be.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.643
So what about it?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.645
Ah, I don't know. I mean,I got to ask Luca,

39:03.689 --> 39:05.691
but it looks likehe ducked out.[phone chimes]

39:06.648 --> 39:10.739
Wow. The deputy mayor.

39:10.783 --> 39:11.610
Deputy mayor'stexting you?

39:11.653 --> 39:13.176
No, it's from Lynch.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.743
She says the deputy mayor
just resigned.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.702
"Stepping down from office

39:16.745 --> 39:20.009
to deal with an addiction issuein his family."

39:20.053 --> 39:21.794
Hey. You did it.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.362
Not alone I didn't.
You guys had my back.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.841
I had Lynch.

39:25.885 --> 39:29.758
Lynch, she might've helped,but this was you. You know it.

39:29.802 --> 39:32.065
You didn't back down.You got it done.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.415
It's just lucky she talked me
into doing it her way,

39:34.459 --> 39:36.286
rather than mine.Lucky for that
drunk kid?

39:36.330 --> 39:38.376
Bet your ass.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.989
HONDO: Ah, come on,where is he, where is he?

39:43.032 --> 39:44.469
What's going on?

39:44.512 --> 39:46.296
Waiting on Luca.He's out on his three-mile run,

39:46.340 --> 39:47.602
trying to finish
his PFQ.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.170
How's it looking?

39:50.213 --> 39:51.867
I don't know.
He's cutting it close.

39:51.911 --> 39:55.349
Mom?I know, honey.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.700
Oh, he's not gonna make it.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.399
There he is.There he is.STREET: Come on, Luca!

40:01.442 --> 40:03.052
HONDO:
Come on, Luca. Come on, Luca!CHRIS: Luca!

40:03.096 --> 40:04.445
[all shouting]

40:04.489 --> 40:06.273
Let's go, let's go!

40:07.927 --> 40:09.668
What do we got?
What do we got?

40:09.711 --> 40:10.973
Two seconds under!

40:11.017 --> 40:13.889
[all cheering]

40:13.933 --> 40:15.325
HONDO:You made it, baby!

40:15.369 --> 40:16.718
You're back, you're back!

40:16.762 --> 40:18.981
I told you!The band is back together!
