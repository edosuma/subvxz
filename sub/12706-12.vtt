00:01.102 --> 00:02.702
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:04.572 --> 00:06.839
How long have you
been practicing?

00:06.873 --> 00:08.676
Since I, um, was little.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.843
Agent Finn is now in charge
of this operation.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.313
We're counting on you, Riley.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.547
Ow!
SPIKE: I can't bite anything.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.448
I can't even hit people.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.551
No pain.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.987
I can hurt a demon.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.623
You really have a lot
to learn about women, Riley.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.027
You're gonna teach me.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.366
What are you?

00:33.401 --> 00:34.935
I'm the slayer.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.371
*

00:50.750 --> 00:53.686
We're not expectin'
anyone, are we?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.689
Willow said
she was gonna be

00:55.722 --> 00:58.192
at the science library
all night.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.560
Is that right?

01:11.239 --> 01:13.073
Uh, apparently not.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.742
We got trouble.
What is it?

01:14.775 --> 01:17.378
I was in the rec room.
It ca-came through the window.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.278
Vampire?

01:18.311 --> 01:20.414
Vampires don't breathe fire.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.081
I should call for backup.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.450
No time.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.918
We have to make this fast.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.653
I have better things to do
tonight than kill.

01:26.686 --> 01:28.588
(hinges creaking)

01:32.359 --> 01:34.395
ALL:
Surprise!

01:34.427 --> 01:35.295
Surprise!

01:37.465 --> 01:39.400
(low chatter)

01:39.432 --> 01:42.770
Guess you won't be killing
anything tonight after all.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.871
Don't be so sure.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.677
(wolf howling)

01:50.710 --> 01:52.813
*

02:42.663 --> 02:45.966
GILES: Yeah, it's, uh,
this is a lively space.

02:45.998 --> 02:49.203
It's like an activity room
we had at public school.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.372
Foosball.
Let's get a game.
Oh. Sorry.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.341
I, uh... one time
I-I got up

02:54.375 --> 02:55.675
to a bit of a prank
with the dartboard.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.078
I'm bored. Let's eat.
Anya...

02:58.110 --> 02:59.847
we talked about this.

03:01.414 --> 03:04.384
I'm sorry.
That was rude.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.620
Please continue
your story.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.824
Hopefully, it involves
treacle and a headmaster.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.759
Go and eat.
Great.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.430
*

03:20.467 --> 03:22.569
Giles. Hi.
Havin' a good time?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.070
Yes, yes. It's, um...

03:24.103 --> 03:26.205
It's a lot of new faces here,
aren't there?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.442
Yeah. Mostly kids
from the dorm.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.043
A couple of Riley's friends.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.177
Hi, Giles.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.913
Buffy.

03:32.945 --> 03:34.046
Happy birthday.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.383
Thank you.
Nineteen.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.449
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

03:36.484 --> 03:37.718
There's someone
I want you to meet.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.353
Um, this is...
Riley Finn,

03:40.388 --> 03:41.754
my boyfriend.

03:43.055 --> 03:44.525
Very nice to meet
you, Mr. Giles.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.926
Did you help plan this?
It was quite a surprise.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.562
The first of many.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.399
Um... been dating long?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.300
Giles was the librarian
at my high school.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.634
Ah. I've seen the library.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.103
It's gone downhill
since you left.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.570
(chuckling) Yes.
I'm embarrassed to say

03:57.604 --> 04:00.540
that I actually
miss it at times.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.141
So... you're retired?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.977
I'm sorry?

04:04.010 --> 04:06.780
Or... you're working
somewhere else now?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.481
Uh, well, not, um...

04:08.515 --> 04:11.451
S-sort of
between projects,

04:11.485 --> 04:13.586
uh, right now.
It's a personal...

04:13.621 --> 04:14.921
Oh... oh, look.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.156
Giles has no cake.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.223
Oh, here.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.459
Here, I'll get
you a piece.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.259
Uh... (sighs)

04:21.928 --> 04:23.230
Oh, he's just nervous.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.399
But this is so nice,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.567
having everyone together
for my birthday.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.437
Of course, you could smash
in all my toes with a hammer,

04:30.471 --> 04:32.004
and it would still be
the bestest Buffy Birthday Bash

04:32.038 --> 04:33.673
in a big, long while.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.274
Right.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.812
Actually, Willow and-and Xander
did all the planning.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.247
Uh, I'm not sure
I would have gone

04:40.279 --> 04:41.649
with the surprise party.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.817
You know, you have
enough things

04:43.850 --> 04:45.452
jumping out at you
in the dark.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.187
Professor Walsh says adrenaline
is like exercise,

04:48.221 --> 04:49.523
but without
the exorbitant gym fees.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.191
Very witty.

04:51.223 --> 04:52.860
You should meet her.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.961
She's absolutely the smartest
person I've ever met.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.865
Perhaps we should have invited
Professor Walsh to the party.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.166
Oh, no.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.701
I mean, she's, like, 40.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.269
She's got better things to do
than hang out

05:03.302 --> 05:05.305
with a bunch of kids.
Here you go, sir.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.610
XANDER:
 You own nothing.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.612
This shouldn't be
taking so long.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.514
Hang on. Let a fella
get organized.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.216
That's my radio.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.550
And you're what,

05:17.584 --> 05:20.187
shocked and disappointed?
I'm evil.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.122
So, what kind of place
are you looking for?

05:22.154 --> 05:23.490
I don't know.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.858
Maybe a crypt.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.728
Someplace, you know,
dark and dank,

05:27.761 --> 05:30.062
but not as dark
and dank as this.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.500
It's pretty depressing,
isn't it?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.567
I've known corpses
with a fresher smell.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.136
In fact, I've been one.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.170
That's it. Let's go.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.675
Wait. I want to
give you something

05:41.709 --> 05:43.076
for your new place.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.911
That's my lamp.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.514
A gift is traditional.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.848
I read about it.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.348
That's among friends.

05:49.382 --> 05:52.720
With bitter enemies, we
don't give them my lamp.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.687
It's not gonna have
electricity anyway.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.223
It's a crypt, remember?

05:56.255 --> 05:57.658
Well, what about running water?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.492
A fridge to keep
your blood fresh?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.060
No.

06:01.093 --> 06:03.029
Oh, well, that's
gonna suck.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.865
You should just
get a hotel room or something.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.067
Demon girl's got a point.
Need fresh blood.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.071
If I had a few bob for a room
with an honor bar...

06:11.103 --> 06:13.273
Out, before I get
the slayer over here

06:13.305 --> 06:14.675
to kick your ass out.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.744
(sighs)
Don't know why she didn't come.

06:16.776 --> 06:20.180
Say good-bye,
shed a few tears.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.115
Well, she has
an appointment with someone

06:22.149 --> 06:23.917
who's actually still scary.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.454
So, the slayer.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.956
Yeah, that's me.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.124
We thought
you were a myth.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.461
Well, you were myth-taken.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.528
And to think
all that time

06:35.562 --> 06:36.596
you were sitting in my class.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.632
Well, most of those times.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.802
I always knew you could
do better than a B-minus,

06:41.834 --> 06:43.971
and now I understand
your energies were directed

06:44.004 --> 06:46.740
to the same place
as ours, in fact.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.576
It's only our methods
that differ.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.444
We use the latest
in scientific technology

06:50.478 --> 06:52.713
and state-of-the-art
weaponry,

06:52.745 --> 06:55.148
and you,
if I understand correctly,

06:55.182 --> 06:57.451
poke them with a sharp stick.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.952
Uh, it's more effective
than it sounds.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.723
Oh, I'm quite sure
of that,

07:02.755 --> 07:06.059
as I'm just as sure we can
learn much from each other.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.295
I'm working
on getting you clearance

07:08.327 --> 07:09.596
to come into the Initiative.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.831
I think you'll find the results

07:10.863 --> 07:12.899
of our operation
most impressive.

07:12.932 --> 07:16.136
Agent Finn here alone
has killed or captured--

07:16.168 --> 07:17.771
how many is it?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.908
17. 11 vampires, six demons.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.177
Oh. Wow.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.247
I mean, that's... 17.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.983
What about you?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.283
Me?

07:32.552 --> 07:35.387
How many hostiles
would you say you've slain?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.730
(sighs)

08:00.514 --> 08:03.350
The third new moon after the...

08:03.382 --> 08:06.353
900th feast of Delthrox.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.891
Oh, crap.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.893
No, we can't wait
for her, Willow.

08:12.925 --> 08:16.129
The Demon Prince Barvain
is going to rise tonight.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.064
Well...

08:18.098 --> 08:21.500
where is she, exactly?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.470
Wow.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.172
Those were
my best stories,

08:25.204 --> 08:28.542
and I didn't tell you the
"Buffy breaks her butt" stories.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.678
But you killed the...

08:31.711 --> 08:33.846
You did the thing
with that...

08:33.880 --> 08:36.683
You drowned.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.219
And the snake?

08:39.251 --> 08:43.890
Not to mention
daily slayage of...

08:43.923 --> 08:46.559
Wow.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.028
It's no big, really.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.697
Hey, who wants ice cream?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.097
Buffy...

08:52.765 --> 08:55.903
When I saw you stop the world
from, you know, ending,

08:55.936 --> 08:58.871
I just assumed that was
a big week for you.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.708
It turns out
I suddenly find myself

09:01.741 --> 09:04.110
needing to know
the plural of Apocalypse.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.214
Look, if you've been fighting
since you were 15,

09:07.246 --> 09:08.916
you'd have
a hefty résumé, too.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.051
Fifteen?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.620
I know. Wow.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.221
The point is, that-that

09:14.254 --> 09:16.188
we have different amounts
of experience, you know?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.857
And plus,
I do have that whole

09:17.890 --> 09:19.927
preternatural
slayer strength deal.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.794
I've seen.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.897
Don't get me wrong, the
girls I grew up with

09:23.931 --> 09:26.198
could hold their own, but...

09:26.232 --> 09:28.969
well, I'm not even sure
I could take you.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.437
That all depends
on your meaning.

09:36.308 --> 09:37.409
(knocking)

09:37.443 --> 09:38.745
Yeah?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.283
Professor Walsh,
I presume.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.717
(door closes)
You're hard to find.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.888
These-these halls
are quite the labyrinth.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.490
I felt like, uh,
Theseus and the Minotaur

09:50.523 --> 09:54.226
in the, um, labyrinth.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.297
Can I help you
with something, Mr....

09:57.330 --> 09:59.633
Giles. Rupert.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.567
I'm looking
for Buffy Summers.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.471
I'm, um, a friend of hers.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.109
And I was her-her
high school librarian.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.910
I'm sorry, Buffy's not here,

10:10.943 --> 10:12.679
but, uh, if I see her...

10:12.712 --> 10:15.849
Buffy's been very
influenced by your course.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.118
She quotes you
quite often.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.787
Sometimes, she sounds
a bit like

10:19.820 --> 10:21.688
an introductory textbook
herself.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.990
I don't lecture
from the textbook,

10:24.024 --> 10:26.259
but I'm glad
she's inspired by the material.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.927
She's bright.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.428
All she's really
been lacking

10:29.461 --> 10:30.998
is encouragement in
the academic setting.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.868
Now, um, I think it's best
if-if, um,

10:34.902 --> 10:38.605
if we let a young person
find their own strength.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.941
If you lead a child
by the hand,

10:40.974 --> 10:43.844
then they'll never find
their own footing.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.678
And if it's true about hiking,

10:45.712 --> 10:47.914
ergo it must be true
about life.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.484
Well, that's not, um...

10:51.518 --> 10:53.552
I'm just saying
that Buffy is, uh,

10:53.586 --> 10:55.654
uh, well, she's not
the typical student.

10:55.688 --> 10:58.792
Once you get to know her,
she's a very unique girl.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.561
I hope you're
not gonna push her.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.363
I think
I do know her,

11:03.395 --> 11:05.197
and I have found her
to be a unique woman.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.666
Woman, of course.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.168
How wrong of me
to choose my own words.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.070
She's very self-reliant,
very independent,

11:10.102 --> 11:13.472
Exactly.
which is not always
a good thing.

11:13.505 --> 11:15.808
I think it can be unhealthy

11:15.842 --> 11:17.409
to take on adult roles
too early.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.379
What I suspect
I'm seeing is a reaction

11:19.412 --> 11:22.014
to the absence
of a male role model.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.649
Absence?

11:23.682 --> 11:26.352
Buffy clearly lacks
a strong father figure.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.890
I'm sorry.
I have things to do.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.692
I'll tell Buffy her friend
was looking for her.

11:40.432 --> 11:42.068
This prince demon guy

11:42.101 --> 11:44.203
was supposed
to rise at sunset,

11:44.236 --> 11:46.038
so aren't we,
like, late?

11:46.072 --> 11:47.875
Of course, if I hadn't
had to search the globe

11:47.908 --> 11:50.177
for our Miss Summers, and do
battle with that harridan...

11:50.210 --> 11:52.178
And if you hadn't gotten lost
on campus afterwards...

11:52.211 --> 11:54.081
Never mind. I'll just have
to take care of it myself.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.015
I've vanquished a few demons
in my day without her.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.350
Of course,
it wouldn't surprise me

11:57.384 --> 11:58.786
if we are entirely too late.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.288
Demon on the loose.
Carnage everywhere.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.229
XANDER:
Your better demons will
clean up after themselves.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.596
(gate closes)

12:10.629 --> 12:11.865
I don't understand.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.900
Um, should be ruptured earth,

12:13.933 --> 12:18.270
and-and broken stone.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.972
Oh, well.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.573
Apparently it hasn't
happened yet.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.076
A bit of luck.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.977
Or, you-you know what I bet?

12:25.011 --> 12:26.879
I-I bet the Initiative
took care of it.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.380
Who?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.817
Oh, Riley and his guys.
Probably all over it.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.953
WILLOW:
Yeah, it has
that "too neat" look.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.721
They must have
cleaned up the place.

12:35.754 --> 12:36.623
What?

12:36.655 --> 12:38.490
Oh, they read hot spots.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.460
Areas of other-worldly energy.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.296
They must have picked
this place up days ago.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.998
Stop. Both of you.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.599
What are you talking about?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.100
Wh-what's the Initiative?

12:48.134 --> 12:50.403
What, um, what on earth
does it have to do

12:50.437 --> 12:51.938
with Buffy's new boyfriend?

12:51.971 --> 12:54.407
You know.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.442
I'm sure you know.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.145
Riley's one of the commandos.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.315
What?!

13:02.349 --> 13:04.583
Well, that's marvelous,
isn't it?

13:04.616 --> 13:07.086
Here I am,
spent weeks trying to get

13:07.120 --> 13:08.587
a single scrap of information

13:08.620 --> 13:11.091
about our mysterious
demon collectors,

13:11.124 --> 13:12.524
and no one bothers to tell me

13:12.558 --> 13:13.961
that Buffy's dating
one of them?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.662
Who else knows?

13:15.695 --> 13:18.798
No one. No one
else knows this.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.701
Anya, and that's it.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.769
And Spike.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.272
Spike?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.639
Spike knew?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.875
Only the basic stuff.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.777
You know, that
Riley's a commando,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.312
and Professor Walsh
is in charge.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.546
Professor Walsh?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.015
That fishwife?

13:36.048 --> 13:38.717
You know, she's actually
not that bad once you get...

13:38.750 --> 13:41.620
So, the demon's probably
a little late.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.789
We'll just, you know...

13:43.822 --> 13:45.859
Oh, forget it.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.394
Go on, you two clear off.

13:47.427 --> 13:51.063
I'll stay a little longer,
just in case.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.799
You sure? 'Cause...
'cause we could stay.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.168
No, go.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.344
Who am I kidding?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.953
Nothing is gonna happen.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.826
I wouldn't say that.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.696
I wouldn't say that at all.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.164
In fact, Ripper, old mate,

14:25.197 --> 14:26.732
I'd say something
rather interesting

14:26.765 --> 14:28.000
was about to happen.

14:28.034 --> 14:28.868
Did someone..?

14:28.902 --> 14:31.203
Oh, bugger.
I thought you'd gone.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.809
Ethan Rayne.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.782
You have no idea
how much thrashing you

14:42.815 --> 14:44.985
is gonna improve my day.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.088
(grunts)

14:50.789 --> 14:53.460
No, no, no, wait!
Hang on!

14:53.493 --> 14:54.927
You can beat
the crap out of me--

14:54.961 --> 14:56.395
go ahead,
I can't stop you--

14:56.428 --> 14:58.764
or you can listen
to what I have to say.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.299
Find out what's going on.

15:00.332 --> 15:01.567
What are you
talking about?

15:01.600 --> 15:02.802
Something bad
is happening.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.370
Bad for both of us.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.605
Bad for you.
No, no, no, listen.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.905
You have to listen.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.640
You're going to need
time to prepare.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.578
Brilliant.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.614
Now, isn't this more fun
than kicking my ass?

15:14.647 --> 15:15.881
No.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.716
Oh.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.552
It's more fun for me.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.322
Just tell me what
you want to tell me.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.624
Oh, so cross.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.427
We used to be friends, Ripper.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.662
When did all that
fall apart?

15:29.696 --> 15:33.899
About the same time
you started to worship chaos.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.168
Oh, religious intolerance.
Sad, that.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.172
I mean, just look at
the Irish troubles.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.540
Oh, hang on.
I'll tell you.

15:45.644 --> 15:48.780
Something happening
in the dark worlds.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.484
It's all whispers
and rumors out there,

15:51.518 --> 15:55.288
but only one thing
is coming through clear...

15:55.322 --> 15:58.191
that something's
harming demons,

15:58.225 --> 16:00.293
and it's not
the slayer.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.028
Know anything
about it?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.629
What are they saying?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.865
Oh, you know demons.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.434
It's all exaggeration
and blank verse.

16:08.467 --> 16:12.172
"Pain as bright as steel."
Things like that.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.375
They're scared.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.177
There's something called
"three-fourteen"

16:17.210 --> 16:19.379
that's got them
scared most of all.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.647
The kind of scared

16:20.679 --> 16:22.782
that turns to angry.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.683
I know we're not

16:24.716 --> 16:27.953
particularly fond
of each other, Rupert...
(chuckles)

16:27.986 --> 16:31.024
...but we are a couple
of old mystics.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.892
This new outfit,

16:32.924 --> 16:35.394
it's blundering into places
it doesn't belong,

16:35.427 --> 16:37.830
throwing the worlds
out of balance,

16:37.864 --> 16:41.234
and that's
way beyond chaos, mate.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.173
We're headed, quite literally,
for one hell of a fight.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.941
(grunts)
(laughs breathlessly)

17:00.787 --> 17:03.123
Are you holding back?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.025
Are you?

17:06.058 --> 17:08.260
Maybe a little.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.063
(grunts)
(grunts)

17:10.096 --> 17:12.098
Maybe a little, too.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.172
I'll go all out if you will.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.507
Are you sure?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.740
Here we go.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.944
Aah!

17:32.719 --> 17:34.019
Riley!

17:34.052 --> 17:35.721
(groans)

17:37.923 --> 17:39.491
Are you hurt?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.132
I, uh...
(clears throat)

17:45.164 --> 17:47.134
I don't think so.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.969
I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't mean to...

17:50.001 --> 17:51.637
It's fine.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.006
I'm good.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.376
(slurring):
Do you know what gets me?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.711
This is what gets me.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.481
20 years I've been
fighting demons.

18:02.515 --> 18:06.752
Maggie Walsh and her
nancy ninja boys come in...

18:06.786 --> 18:10.056
six months later, the demons are
pissing themselves with fear.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.057
They never even noticed me.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.992
Who's Maggie Walsh?

18:14.026 --> 18:16.328
Oh, she's awful.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.332
She said I was
an absent male role model.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.067
Absent, my arse.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.902
But I'm twice the man she is.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.804
You know, you're really
very attractive.

18:24.836 --> 18:26.506
Hmm?

18:26.538 --> 18:30.009
Here's my... my name and number.

18:30.041 --> 18:33.980
You give me...
a call,

18:34.012 --> 18:35.615
I'll show you a good time.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.250
(sarcastically):
Yeah, thanks.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.085
GILES:
We've gotta face it.
We've changed.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.619
Well, not you.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.088
You're still
sadistic and self-centered.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.324
Here's to me.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.959
The world
has passed us by.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.961
Someone snuck in and left

18:48.994 --> 18:53.266
this couple of clapped-out
has-beens in our place.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.368
This Initiative, I mean...

18:56.403 --> 18:58.471
their methods may be
causing problems,

18:58.505 --> 19:00.640
but they're getting
the job done.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.842
What am I?
I'm an unemployed librarian

19:02.875 --> 19:05.010
with a tendency to get
knocked on the head and...

19:05.044 --> 19:07.614
Well, you won't have to worry
about that anymore, mate.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.382
When you went to the loo,

19:09.415 --> 19:11.218
I slipped a small pellet
of poison in your drink.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.519
You'll be dead in an hour.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.857
Just kidding!

19:18.891 --> 19:20.125
(laughs)

19:20.159 --> 19:22.429
(both laughing)

19:26.097 --> 19:28.000
I'm gonna feel like hell
in the morning.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.635
Relax.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.805
Enjoy the night.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.973
We're still a couple
of sorcerers.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.144
The night is still our time.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.579
A time of magic.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.080
To magic.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.185
I'm glad you wanted
to get together.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.020
I know it's late.

19:49.055 --> 19:52.358
I... thanks.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.560
Um, I was happy you called.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.266
We'll start out slow.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.634
Okay.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.710
Willow?

20:10.742 --> 20:12.878
Yeah.
Start out slow

20:12.912 --> 20:14.180
doing what?

20:14.212 --> 20:16.883
Oh.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.352
We're gonna float the rose,

20:19.385 --> 20:22.188
then use the magicks
to pluck the petals off,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.557
one at a time.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.858
It's a test
of synchronicity.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.929
Our minds have to be
perfectly attuned

20:29.961 --> 20:32.964
to work as a single,
delicate implement.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.468
Cool.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.971
And it should be very pretty.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.008
*

21:10.169 --> 21:12.171
*

21:19.979 --> 21:21.847
It worked.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.284
Now for the hard part.
The petals.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.163
What the heck was that?

21:38.197 --> 21:40.866
I don't know, but, uh,
the petals are off.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.574
(alarm clock buzzing)

21:53.311 --> 21:55.314
(clicks, buzzing stops)

21:57.182 --> 21:59.018
GILES:
I knew I'd feel like hell
in the morning.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.019
(heavy footsteps)

22:01.053 --> 22:03.055
(yawning)

22:10.730 --> 22:12.964
Uh...

22:12.999 --> 22:14.232
Wha...

22:18.404 --> 22:19.872
No!

22:19.905 --> 22:22.240
Oh.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.077
Damn!

22:33.786 --> 22:36.255
Ethan.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.703
(grunting)

22:55.240 --> 22:57.108
(ripping)

22:57.143 --> 22:59.711
Oh, and I liked that shirt.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.862
I like pancakes
'cause they're stackable.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.431
Ooh, and waffles,
'cause you can put things

23:18.464 --> 23:20.266
in the little holes
if you wanted to.

23:20.298 --> 23:21.701
You should always have
a new boyfriend.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.234
You're so much fun right now.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.471
Hey, I didn't hear you
come in last night.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.239
Where were you?

23:27.272 --> 23:29.375
The chem lab, by myself.

23:29.407 --> 23:33.112
I-I was trying this new spell--
floating a rose--

23:33.144 --> 23:35.213
when all of a sudden,
zing, zing, zing!

23:35.247 --> 23:37.316
Like, all around the room.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.652
It was like
a rose-based missile.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.721
Yikes.
I know.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.490
I think there's
something out there.

23:43.522 --> 23:46.258
I-I felt this presence,

23:46.291 --> 23:49.761
this dark magicks energy
blocking the spell.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.064
It's new.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.965
Is someone else doing magicks?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.403
Maybe. If so,
it's someone pretty powerful.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.270
Mmm. Well, I'll tell
Giles about it.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.307
Or maybe I'll tell Maggie.

24:01.339 --> 24:03.409
She seemed kind
of interested in learning

24:03.442 --> 24:05.243
the mystical side
of the whole demon-hunting biz.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.346
Tell Giles.

24:07.378 --> 24:08.847
He's feeling a little
hurt right now.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.415
How come you
never told him

24:10.449 --> 24:12.151
about Riley being a commando?

24:12.183 --> 24:14.854
Did.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.256
I didn't?
He says no.

24:17.288 --> 24:20.692
He's feeling neglected
and out-of-the-loopy.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.127
Well, I mean, I didn't at first,

24:22.161 --> 24:23.596
because Riley said not to,

24:23.630 --> 24:25.998
and then, meow,
cat out of the bag,

24:26.031 --> 24:28.968
and I guess I just forgot
that he didn't know.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.136
I'll make it up to him
when I see him. Tomorrow.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.005
I'm spending today with Riley.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.707
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
That's what you always do

24:34.740 --> 24:37.009
on the days when
the earth rotates.

24:37.042 --> 24:40.046
It's just going
so well right now.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.080
I think. I hope.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.953
I sort of... kicked him
across the room last night.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.322
Um, that's not good.

24:50.355 --> 24:52.490
We were sparring,
and he said not to hold back,

24:52.525 --> 24:54.826
and he's a little dented.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.663
But he-he said
he was okay with it,

24:56.695 --> 24:58.463
and I-I think
he's okay with it.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.865
Do-do you think
he's okay with it?

24:59.898 --> 25:01.534
I'm sure he is.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.502
I mean, if he's not,
you know, you had to do it.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.471
I mean, he's right.
You can't walk around

25:06.505 --> 25:08.039
pretending you're
less than you are.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.241
It wouldn't be right
for you to hold back.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.878
Right.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.480
What?

25:14.512 --> 25:17.516
I held back a little.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.694
You still asleep?

25:32.397 --> 25:34.365
It's 10:30 in the morning.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.506
Xander.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.540
Xander, wake up.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.077
Mom?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.445
No, it's not Mom.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.882
Now, when you look at me,

25:49.915 --> 25:52.852
you may be a little alarmed,
but there's no need.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.621
It's-it's me, Giles.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.455
Now, Ethan has
turned me into a demon,

25:57.489 --> 25:59.224
and I need your help.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.528
Hello.
Yes, it's me.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.864
(speaking demon language)

26:04.896 --> 26:06.464
(screams)

26:06.498 --> 26:08.601
Xander, listen.
Don't you understand me?

26:08.634 --> 26:11.770
(speaking demon language)

26:11.804 --> 26:13.038
Demon!

26:13.071 --> 26:14.606
Demon!

26:14.641 --> 26:16.474
(speaking demon language)

26:16.508 --> 26:18.144
...please,
don't you understand?

26:18.176 --> 26:19.645
No, no, don't!
Xander...

26:19.679 --> 26:21.380
Calm down! You're just...

26:21.413 --> 26:23.816
Ow! You're just a little
overwrought. Ow!

26:24.482 --> 26:27.086
(speaking demon language)

26:27.118 --> 26:28.319
(snarling)

26:28.354 --> 26:31.457
(roaring)

26:31.490 --> 26:32.892
That's right!

26:32.924 --> 26:34.559
Run for your life!

26:34.593 --> 26:36.561
(speaking demon language)

26:36.595 --> 26:38.497
(children exclaiming)

26:38.529 --> 26:41.067
Oh, oh! I'm sorry!

26:41.099 --> 26:43.102
Call 911!

26:43.134 --> 26:44.336
(crying)

26:44.369 --> 26:46.372
Bloody humans!

26:51.143 --> 26:53.846
*

26:53.880 --> 26:56.515
BUFFY:
 So it had pointy things.

26:56.548 --> 26:57.784
What kind of
pointy things?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.585
The pointy kind.
And tufty ears.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.987
Oh, and it might have
a saucepan-shaped bruise.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.320
Giles will know
what it... was.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.128
Giles?

27:15.667 --> 27:17.336
Looks like Xander
wasn't the only one

27:17.368 --> 27:18.805
to get a visit today.

27:18.837 --> 27:19.705
He's not upstairs.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.440
Oh, God, Giles.

27:21.472 --> 27:23.843
Okay, there's a demon,
and Giles is gone.

27:23.875 --> 27:26.311
But it doesn't mean
that he's hurt.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.346
I mean, there's
no blood anywhere,

27:28.380 --> 27:29.981
so maybe the demon
just took him somewhere.

27:30.016 --> 27:33.085
I think it ate him up.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.459
(sighs)

27:40.491 --> 27:42.994
Well.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.397
What do I spy
with my little eye?

27:49.535 --> 27:50.970
A demon.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.806
That would be--
oh, right--

27:53.839 --> 27:56.575
the things I can kill.

27:56.607 --> 27:59.345
Spike. Wonderful.

27:59.377 --> 28:01.212
The perfect end
to a perfect day.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.383
Giles?
Go on, then.

28:04.415 --> 28:07.219
Let's get on
with the fighting...

28:07.252 --> 28:08.653
You understand me.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.556
Of course I understand you.

28:10.588 --> 28:12.223
I'm speaking English?

28:12.258 --> 28:13.491
No, you're speaking Fyarl.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.161
I happen to speak Fyarl.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.394
And by the way,
why the hell

28:16.428 --> 28:17.829
are you suddenly
a Fyarl demon?

28:17.864 --> 28:20.767
You just come over
all demony this morning?

28:20.799 --> 28:22.268
As a matter of fact,
I did,

28:22.300 --> 28:23.669
thanks to Ethan Rayne.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.270
You have to help me find him.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.239
He must undo this,

28:27.272 --> 28:29.875
and then he needs
a good being-killed.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.778
And I'm supposed
to just help you

28:31.810 --> 28:34.113
out of the evilness of my heart?

28:35.748 --> 28:38.683
You help me,
and I-I don't kill you.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.386
Oh, tremendously convincing.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.454
Try it again
without the stutter.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.757
Money?

28:44.790 --> 28:46.424
I could pay you money.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.460
Oh, I like money.
How much?

28:48.493 --> 28:50.261
$100?

28:50.296 --> 28:52.131
$100.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.067
You'll have to do
a lot better than that.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.103
$200.
Fine.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.204
Right, then.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.140
Right, then.
What's first?

29:01.173 --> 29:03.409
I run and tell the slayer what
you've gotten yourself into?
No.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.778
When I find Ethan,
I can clear all this up

29:05.811 --> 29:07.445
without Buffy
ever having to find out

29:07.479 --> 29:09.480
that anything
happened to me at all.

29:10.648 --> 29:13.719
Okay, that's
a giant vulture.

29:13.751 --> 29:16.888
I'd have mentioned
if it was a giant vulture.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.757
Buffy, even if we figure out
what kind of demon got Giles,

29:18.790 --> 29:19.991
I mean, how are
we gonna find it?

29:20.026 --> 29:23.394
We'll figure it out.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.464
Oh, this one
has tufty ears.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.334
(door rattles)

29:29.335 --> 29:30.336
What was that?

29:39.811 --> 29:41.913
Buffy.
Riley.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.315
What are
you doing here?

29:43.348 --> 29:45.451
There were 911 calls

29:45.483 --> 29:47.153
from a couple different places,
including here.

29:47.185 --> 29:50.322
You get 911 calls?

29:50.355 --> 29:51.857
We have a tap
into the system.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.125
It flags things

29:53.159 --> 29:54.359
with possible
non-human causes.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.661
We check them out.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.695
What are you doing here?

29:57.729 --> 29:58.998
This is Giles' apartment.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.298
He's missing.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.134
The calls.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.369
Did anyone see what did it?

30:04.403 --> 30:06.137
Negative. No.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.974
Neighbors just heard,
you know, growling,

30:09.008 --> 30:10.209
and things breaking.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.376
Sounded like
a struggle.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.479
Poor Giles.

30:13.511 --> 30:14.813
BUFFY:
We'll get him back.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.182
What are
you working on?

30:17.215 --> 30:19.184
BUFFY:
Uh, we have stuff.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.019
Pictures.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.320
We have nothing.

30:27.759 --> 30:28.994
I'll help.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.362
The whole Initiative.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.829
We'll do whatever you need.

30:31.864 --> 30:35.634
Thanks. I just wish
I knew what I needed.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.203
I keep thinking,
"Let's ask Giles."

30:38.237 --> 30:40.172
Then I remember.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.673
He'd be great right now.

30:41.707 --> 30:42.909
He'd find himself in a second.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.809
Nobody is cooler in a crisis.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.979
(gears grinding)
If you can't find
third gear,

30:47.012 --> 30:49.580
don't try
for third gear.
I'm doing my best.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.050
I don't know if I'm driving this
thing,
or wearing it.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.551
It's perfectly
serviceable.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.554
(giggles)

30:55.586 --> 30:58.490
Funny hearing a Fyarl
demon say "serviceable."

30:58.523 --> 31:00.759
Had a couple of them
working for me once.

31:00.791 --> 31:03.694
They're more like,
"Like to crush. Crush now?"

31:03.729 --> 31:05.864
Strong, though.

31:05.897 --> 31:07.833
You won't meet a jar you can't
open for the rest of your life.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.201
(growls)

31:09.234 --> 31:11.502
What was that?
Did you growl?

31:11.537 --> 31:13.372
No.

31:13.404 --> 31:16.041
Listen, about this
Fyarl demon,

31:16.075 --> 31:19.211
do-do I have special powers?

31:19.244 --> 31:23.281
Like setting things on fire
with my sizzling eye beams?

31:23.315 --> 31:25.250
Well, you got
the mucous thing.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.586
What? Mucous?

31:27.618 --> 31:28.886
Paralyzing mucous.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.122
It shoots out
through the nose.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.090
Sets up fast.
Hard as rock.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.358
Pretty good
in a fight.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.792
Are you making this up?

31:34.826 --> 31:36.394
Maybe.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.596
But hey, if you feel
a sneeze coming on, you warn me.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.897
(growls)

31:41.299 --> 31:42.768
Turn, here.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.136
Downshift, downshift!

31:45.171 --> 31:47.638
Calm down, will you?
I'm not sure I can.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.442
I feel like I'm changing.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.479
Fine with me,
so long as you pay me.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.280
I don't like this feeling,

31:55.314 --> 31:59.550
a sort of mindless
need to destroy,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.453
this anger... rage.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.323
Good times.
Go with it.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.624
No.

32:05.656 --> 32:07.292
It's-it's fun.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.095
I can't do it.
Do it for me. Huh?

32:09.127 --> 32:10.729
Let yourself go.

32:10.761 --> 32:11.963
I refuse to become
a monster

32:11.998 --> 32:13.298
because I look
like a monster.

32:13.332 --> 32:16.768
I have a soul.
I have a conscience.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.936
I am a human being.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.372
Ooh, stop the car.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.278
(roaring)

32:27.313 --> 32:28.480
(screams)

32:28.513 --> 32:30.516
(roaring)

32:34.519 --> 32:36.521
(muttering)

32:39.525 --> 32:41.926
Right. Let's go, then.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.930
That's the thing
that attacked me.

32:44.962 --> 32:47.598
A Fyarl demon.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.835
Sort of
a foot soldier type.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.837
Works for other demons
lots of the time.

32:52.871 --> 32:56.342
Very strong.
Ugh... and hey, mucous.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.976
Mucous?

32:58.009 --> 33:00.179
(cell phone rings)

33:02.013 --> 33:03.214
Agent Finn.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.482
Go ahead.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.851
How do I kill it?

33:05.884 --> 33:08.519
Silver. A weapon
made of silver.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.056
Yes.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.957
I understand.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.559
The demon attacked
Professor Walsh.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.695
Got out of a small,
gray car. A Citroen.

33:17.729 --> 33:18.963
It stole Giles's car.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.999
Why would a demon
steal a car?

33:21.032 --> 33:23.234
Why would a demon
steal that car?

33:23.269 --> 33:25.171
A demon that steals a car

33:25.203 --> 33:28.240
has a reason, a purpose,

33:28.273 --> 33:31.042
but it doesn't sound
like these Fyarl demons

33:31.076 --> 33:33.179
are really big,
independent thinkers.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.414
So, Will, the spells
that are going wrong--

33:36.448 --> 33:38.016
could they be caused by someone

33:38.049 --> 33:39.684
using magicks
to control a demon?

33:39.718 --> 33:42.354
Making this Fyarl
demon attack Giles?

33:42.387 --> 33:44.190
Yeah. Yes, that
would draw in

33:44.222 --> 33:45.590
a lot of dark energy.

33:45.624 --> 33:48.259
Okay. Willow, Xander, stay here.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.595
Whoever's controlling
this demon

33:49.627 --> 33:51.197
may call and ask
for a ransom.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.431
Give them anything
they want.
You got it.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.665
Riley, you and I are going to
the magic shop.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.768
Maybe they needed
supplies.

33:56.801 --> 33:59.938
Uh, something
silver...

33:59.971 --> 34:02.208
A letter opener?
It's not very sharp.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.643
Then I'll have to put some
muscle behind it.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.114
*

34:08.146 --> 34:09.914
Two of them.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.916
English, like me...
Mm-hmm.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.851
...but older,
less attractive.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.355
One of them gave you
his number.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.590
WAITRESS:
I threw it out.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.226
I mean, I took one look and saw
he was staying at that rat trap?

34:21.260 --> 34:22.460
No, thanks.

34:22.494 --> 34:23.728
Which rat trap?

34:23.762 --> 34:24.963
The one by
the highway.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.231
The Sunnydale
Motor Inn.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.898
Thank you.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.271
Okay. Credit card slip,
sales receipts...

34:32.304 --> 34:33.605
Help me look.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.574
You shouldn't have
done that to the door.

34:35.606 --> 34:38.210
I do not have time to play
by the rules tonight.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.478
I have a master key.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.746
It opens every shop
on Main Street.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.750
Oh. Well, next time.
Absolutely.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.251
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.954
I do.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.157
Ethan Rayne.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.824
Who's that?
Professional
bad guy.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.226
He's gotta be the guy

34:54.260 --> 34:55.726
that made the demon
attack Giles.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.429
At least we know who
we're looking for.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.797
Command,
are you there?

34:58.829 --> 35:00.231
What are you doing?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.434
It's Agent Finn.
I need a search.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.934
Local hotel registrations

35:03.969 --> 35:05.170
matching the name Ethan Rayne.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.338
R-A-Y-N-E.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.275
Call me back.

35:09.307 --> 35:10.675
You can do that?

35:10.708 --> 35:12.177
It will take
a couple of minutes.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.644
Get in the car.

35:13.679 --> 35:14.913
Be ready to go.

35:14.945 --> 35:16.181
Buffy...

35:16.215 --> 35:18.284
Earlier, when I talked
to Professor Walsh,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.818
she gave me
very specific orders.

35:20.851 --> 35:22.119
Yeah?

35:22.153 --> 35:24.523
She said when we
located the demon, I...

35:24.556 --> 35:26.324
(sighs)

35:26.358 --> 35:27.992
I'm not supposed
to bring you along.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.360
Oh.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.628
Uh, what are you doing?

35:30.661 --> 35:31.862
I'm going to the car.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.931
Buffy, I can't take you with me.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.601
You're not taking me with you.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.536
I am going, and I am
letting you come along.

35:37.568 --> 35:38.869
Buffy, it's not really
your call.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.672
This is a military
operation now.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.273
Then call out the troops,

35:42.307 --> 35:44.210
because nothing less than that
is gonna stop me.

35:44.242 --> 35:45.844
This demon did
something to Giles,

35:45.876 --> 35:47.313
and I'm gonna kill it.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.224
(growling)

35:58.257 --> 35:59.824
How are you
feeling, mate?

35:59.858 --> 36:03.061
Like snapping necks
until everyone's dead.

36:03.094 --> 36:05.331
Now, that sounds
like a Fyarl demon.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.731
Good for you.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.302
Hey. Picked up a tail.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.003
Yes, just a little one.
Hurts when I sit.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.206
I mean, someone's
following us.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.574
What?
Humvee. Military.

36:16.608 --> 36:19.411
Well, speed up.
Lose them.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.679
I've got it floored.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.414
Why did you buy this car?

36:22.447 --> 36:23.681
Well, do something.
If they catch us,

36:23.715 --> 36:24.983
we'll both end up in a lab.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.385
It's getting closer.

36:27.418 --> 36:28.987
(tires squealing)

36:29.019 --> 36:30.755
And it's got
a friend.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.324
Damn!

36:32.358 --> 36:33.891
Oh, sure. Dismantle
the getaway car.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.159
That'll scare them.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.427
Slow down.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.695
I'll jump out.
They'll follow you.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.331
Hold on.
These commandos,

36:39.364 --> 36:41.099
they're the same guys
that are after me, too.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.434
Maybe I want you
around to split
their attention.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.304
I'll pay you
another $100.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.217
(car horn honking wildly)

37:02.954 --> 37:04.523
Aah!

37:04.556 --> 37:06.958
Giles?

37:06.992 --> 37:09.027
(growling)

37:09.059 --> 37:11.362
Now, it-it... calm down.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.597
It's okay.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.199
Good Giles.

37:14.231 --> 37:15.634
(roars)
Aah!

37:15.666 --> 37:17.369
No, no, don't kill me.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.271
No, don't kill me,
Giles.

37:19.304 --> 37:22.440
I can't undo you
if you kill me!

37:25.175 --> 37:27.878
You've got to stop it!

37:27.913 --> 37:29.648
It killed Ripper.
Now it's trying to get me.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.282
Don't let him go.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.985
(grunts)

37:34.018 --> 37:35.721
What did you do to him?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.789
What did you do?

37:37.822 --> 37:39.858
(tires screeching)

37:44.329 --> 37:45.996
(laughing)

37:53.672 --> 37:56.775
You just try and stop me,
you stupid jarhead.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.380
(roars)

38:04.715 --> 38:06.717
(grunting)

38:11.822 --> 38:13.791
You're only gonna
make him angry.

38:13.824 --> 38:14.525
(grunts)

38:18.163 --> 38:20.231
(grunting)

38:24.369 --> 38:25.536
Aah!

38:31.376 --> 38:33.679
(roars)

38:36.847 --> 38:38.048
This is for Giles.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.418
For me?

38:40.985 --> 38:42.219
(gasps)

38:42.253 --> 38:44.889
Oh, God. Giles!

38:44.922 --> 38:47.992
(speaking demon language)

38:48.025 --> 38:49.795
Oh, God. Giles.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.996
Giles! I'm s... I'm so sorry.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.364
Please don't die.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.367
Actually, I feel quite well,

38:55.400 --> 38:57.369
except for the rage.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.003
I think he's okay.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.340
Is this thing real silver?

39:02.373 --> 39:03.809
ETHAN:
 I've really got to learn

39:03.842 --> 39:06.378
to just do the damage
and get out of town.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.947
It's the stay-and-gloat
that gets me every time.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.023
You okay?

39:19.056 --> 39:23.762
Oh, um...
embarrassed, mostly.

39:23.795 --> 39:27.132
Ethan's wardrobe's
not helping any.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.367
How did you know it was me?

39:30.402 --> 39:33.038
Your eyes.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.940
You're the only person
in the world

39:35.974 --> 39:38.543
that can look
that annoyed with me.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.512
(both laugh)

39:40.545 --> 39:43.081
ETHAN:
Is this gonna
go on much longer?

39:43.114 --> 39:45.083
I'd rather like
to be going.

39:45.115 --> 39:47.351
And why would
I let you go?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.355
Well, maybe because
you have no choice.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.757
I'm human.
You can't kill me.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.592
What's a slayer
going to do to me?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.027
By the authority
of the U.S. military,

39:56.061 --> 39:57.429
you are being
taken into custody,

39:57.463 --> 40:00.532
pending a determination
of your status.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.233
We'll take it from here.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.202
Let's go. Move it.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.371
They'll, uh, take Mr. Rayne

40:06.403 --> 40:08.373
to a secret
detention facility

40:08.405 --> 40:09.775
in the Nevada desert.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.208
I'm sure

40:11.242 --> 40:13.445
he'll be rehabilitated
in no time.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.646
Um, if you
don't mind,

40:15.681 --> 40:17.215
I'm just gonna
go and watch them

40:17.248 --> 40:19.451
manhandle him
into a vehicle.

40:24.121 --> 40:25.623
Thanks.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.425
I told you I'd help.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.827
You did. If I had
gotten here any later,

40:29.860 --> 40:32.963
I mean, if Giles
had killed Ethan,

40:32.998 --> 40:35.400
I never would have
gotten him back.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.335
You'd find some other way.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.007
You're really strong.

40:43.041 --> 40:47.612
Like, Spider-Man strong.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.614
Yeah.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.315
But I don't stick to stuff.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.583
But...

40:52.617 --> 40:53.985
yeah.

40:54.018 --> 40:55.621
And you're in charge.

40:55.653 --> 40:59.123
You're like: make the plan,
execute the plan.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.527
No one giving you orders.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.996
I'm the slayer.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.333
I like it.

41:11.335 --> 41:12.704
Yeah?

41:14.472 --> 41:17.509
But give me another,
oh, week to get ready,

41:17.543 --> 41:19.744
and I'll take you down.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.684
Nice phone.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.786
Yes, fabulous technology.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.222
You see, if anyone has any
information I need to know,

41:32.257 --> 41:35.527
they can, uh, simply
tell me about it

41:35.561 --> 41:37.728
through this ingenious
speaking tube.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.565
I'm very excited.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.333
I am sorry, Giles.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.369
I really thought I told you
about Riley and the Initiative,

41:45.402 --> 41:48.005
and I know that it doesn't help.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.074
Look, I promise,
it won't happen again.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.110
I will tell you
everything.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.681
Buffy, I don't want
to ask you to,

41:55.713 --> 41:57.514
um, betray
any confidences,

41:57.548 --> 41:58.983
and I certainly
don't want to interfere...

41:59.016 --> 42:00.251
Uh-oh.

42:00.284 --> 42:01.753
You have but-face.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.155
You look like
you're gonna say "but."

42:05.190 --> 42:10.394
But... this,
um, Initiative...

42:10.427 --> 42:12.563
I'm-I'm a little concerned.

42:12.597 --> 42:15.099
Um, Ethan's not exactly
a reliable source,

42:15.132 --> 42:19.704
but, um, I'm not sure
that he's wrong about them.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.672
I'm not dating
the Initiative.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.574
I'm dating Riley.

42:23.608 --> 42:24.842
He's a good guy.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.777
And I believe that,

42:26.811 --> 42:30.849
but he's part of something that
we-we don't really understand.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.884
Are you sure you're
not just saying this

42:32.918 --> 42:34.786
because you don't
like Riley's boss?

42:34.820 --> 42:37.688
No, no, I'm not
saying that at all.

42:37.722 --> 42:41.358
Though I do hate her
quite a lot.

42:41.391 --> 42:43.594
But I want you to have
your personal life,

42:43.628 --> 42:46.063
but keep your eyes open.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.934
Make sure you know what
you're getting into.

42:48.967 --> 42:51.235
WALSH:
 So, she walks in

42:51.268 --> 42:52.771
and the rules
just suddenly break.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.706
Um, pretty much.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.876
Be careful with her.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.911
She reacts on instinct.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.646
There's no
discipline there.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.114
Her loyalties
are uncertain.

43:03.148 --> 43:04.382
You won't be
disappointed in her.

43:04.414 --> 43:06.483
She's good
at what she does,

43:06.516 --> 43:08.385
and she is the truest soul
I've ever known.

43:08.418 --> 43:11.088
Oh, no. Oh, no.
(laughing)

43:11.121 --> 43:13.490
Spontaneous poetic exclamations.

43:13.523 --> 43:15.126
Lord, spare me
college boys in love.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.594
I'm just saying she'll work out.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.230
You'll be proud of her.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.599
You want to know what I think?

43:22.934 --> 43:25.836
I think you're probably right.

43:33.043 --> 43:35.045
