01:18.328 --> 01:19.428
Sorry sorry.

01:32.076 --> 01:34.811
- Are you all right?
- I've got a weird situation going on.

01:34.936 --> 01:38.029
- I've been calling you all morning.
- Sorry. My phone's been off.

01:38.419 --> 01:40.048
What's the matter?

01:40.559 --> 01:43.863
Lisa and Michelle... The lesbians
I've been donating all my sperm to...

01:43.988 --> 01:45.730
They've disappeared.
I'm worried.

01:46.121 --> 01:47.679
Why do you think that?

01:47.804 --> 01:49.775
I don't know.
My emails are bouncing back.

01:50.198 --> 01:52.763
Their phones are out of service.
It's been going on for 5 days.

01:52.888 --> 01:55.239
if they got an accident?
What if they're in a coma?

01:55.443 --> 01:57.450
I don't think
they would both be in a coma.

01:57.829 --> 01:59.729
They do everything together.

01:59.854 --> 02:03.271
- Have you called the local hospitals?
- I don't know their last names.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.708
But you've been giving them
your sperm for two months.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.461
- Yeah, but I'm bad with names.
- They're probably on a trip.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.903
No, they would have told me.
We've become very close.

02:12.028 --> 02:15.581
For years I've been jerking off
purely for medicinal reasons,

02:15.706 --> 02:16.886
like lancing a wound.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.806
But trying to have a baby with them
has given it new meaning.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.413
- I understand.
- What if something happened to them?

02:23.538 --> 02:26.228
What if Michelle wasn't conceiving
and they just dumped me?

02:26.518 --> 02:27.636
I don't know.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.602
Where was the last place
you saw them?

02:30.727 --> 02:33.069
Ozzie's cafe.
It's where we did the sperm transfer.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.985
- Let's go there.
- Why?

02:35.155 --> 02:38.551
In detective novels you always start
where the missing person last was

02:38.676 --> 02:40.326
and work your way back.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.869
Okay, are you sure you can
take a writing break?

02:42.994 --> 02:44.932
Yeah, I'm at a really good
stoping point.

02:45.057 --> 02:46.057
Let's go.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.633
You do all the talking.
She doesn't like me.

02:59.752 --> 03:01.222
Can I ask you a few questions?

03:01.763 --> 03:02.681
Who are you?

03:02.849 --> 03:04.975
My name is Jonathan Ames.
I'm a private detective.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.520
- You don't look like a cop.
- I'm a private cop.

03:07.708 --> 03:10.187
A security guard?
Why aren't you wearing your outfit?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.191
Private detectives
don't wear outfits.

03:12.924 --> 03:14.652
Look, do you recognize this man?

03:14.963 --> 03:16.313
Yeah, I know him.

03:16.481 --> 03:18.864
He comes in with a cooler
and doesn't order anything.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.534
I'm an illustrator.
I'm a little low on money right now.

03:22.222 --> 03:25.040
- Ever see him with two women?
- Yeah, they were nice.

03:25.165 --> 03:26.226
They spent money.

03:26.351 --> 03:28.487
They also had a cooler.
It was weird.

03:28.612 --> 03:30.209
Why were you carrying that thing?

03:30.377 --> 03:33.484
I don't mean to be rude,
but I was transporting chilled semen.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.130
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.173
Look, the two women
you saw him with, are missing.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.136
- Do you know where they live?
- I don't know where anybody live.

03:41.443 --> 03:42.304
Question...

03:42.492 --> 03:45.043
If you don't know where they live
how do you know they're missing?

03:46.246 --> 03:48.046
That's an excellent point.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.147
I've seen them at the food co-op.

03:53.272 --> 03:56.507
You have to be a member to shop there.
So they'll have their address.

03:57.015 --> 03:58.732
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

04:02.549 --> 04:05.202
Sorry, it's all I got.
I'm kind of a starving artist.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.416
You look like you eat
all right to me.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.332
I know all the members of the co-op,

04:15.457 --> 04:18.624
and I can't place a couple
named Michelle and Lisa.

04:19.339 --> 04:22.421
But park slope has more lesbians
than any other city in the U.S.

04:22.546 --> 04:24.597
It's kind of like San Francisco,
but for women.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.904
I love San Francisco.
The light there is very beautiful.

04:27.222 --> 04:30.003
Shit. You must have seen 'em.
Michelle is large-chested.

04:30.128 --> 04:31.153
Lisa is strange.

04:31.278 --> 04:34.543
She doesn't look at you in the eye.
She had those tattoos on her neck...

04:34.668 --> 04:37.044
The circle thing
with a cross going down

04:37.169 --> 04:40.654
that stands for vaginas or women's
restrooms or something like that.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.556
You know who he's talking about,
don't you?

04:43.681 --> 04:45.956
Yeah, I know 'em.
I've seen that tattoo.

04:46.081 --> 04:47.912
But their names aren't
Michelle or Lisa.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.179
What are their names
and where do they live?

04:50.304 --> 04:52.744
I'm not telling you.
This is a food co-op, okay?

04:52.869 --> 04:55.669
People expect privacy.
We have ethics here.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.019
Would...

04:58.791 --> 05:00.318
$20 help you with your ethics?

05:00.443 --> 05:02.191
Who do you think you are?

05:02.316 --> 05:04.316
The people who work here
are like family.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.430
I'm not gonna betray
their trust for money.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.477
I might have something else

05:12.064 --> 05:13.337
that interests you.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.210
I like a man
who carries a one-hitter.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.205
I can tell that this is good stuff

05:21.330 --> 05:24.615
because I'm kind of missing
everyone in my life right now

05:24.783 --> 05:26.182
but I don't mind,

05:26.459 --> 05:28.410
because it's like
a beautiful sadness.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.768
That happens to me too
when I'm high...

05:30.893 --> 05:32.665
I miss everyone and I love everyone.

05:33.154 --> 05:35.213
When I'm high I realize

05:35.890 --> 05:37.127
that I clench my anus.

05:37.595 --> 05:39.973
- That's not healthy.
- You clench it all the time?

05:40.098 --> 05:42.299
Yeah, but smoking
helps me unclench it.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.677
See, that's why pot
should be legalized.

05:46.732 --> 05:49.482
I think this is
what you guys are looking for.

05:51.049 --> 05:52.650
I've got to get back to work.

05:53.924 --> 05:56.739
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

05:56.864 --> 05:59.307
I was worried about them.
We're trying to have a baby together.

05:59.432 --> 06:00.431
Yeah, thank you.

06:00.556 --> 06:02.736
And if you see them again,
please give me a call.

06:03.246 --> 06:04.246
Or...

06:04.915 --> 06:06.814
call me if you want
more of this pot.

06:06.939 --> 06:09.628
The guy I deal with
is very organic and hydroponic.

06:11.745 --> 06:13.706
We should definitely
smoke again sometime.

06:14.194 --> 06:17.209
I just ordered this
vaporizer... The volcano.

06:17.576 --> 06:19.753
They use it on cancer patients
in Germany.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.964
- Great.
- It's really healthy.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.182
It's what Woody Harrelson uses.

06:37.408 --> 06:39.398
Why would they give me false names?

06:39.584 --> 06:42.471
I had a crush on a Michelle,
not a margaret.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.810
That co-op girl was really cute.

06:45.287 --> 06:47.228
I think she kind of liked me.

06:47.353 --> 06:48.855
I think she liked your pot.

06:48.980 --> 06:50.080
She liked me

06:50.419 --> 06:51.419
and my pot.

06:53.310 --> 06:55.357
Okay, they're not answering.
Now what?

07:03.305 --> 07:06.121
Yes, building inspector.
I need to be buzzed in.

07:06.246 --> 07:07.596
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

07:11.630 --> 07:12.792
Yeah, it's...

07:13.517 --> 07:14.349
UPS.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.517
I have that thing you ordered.

07:19.568 --> 07:20.568
Nice.

07:31.256 --> 07:32.659
I can pick the lock.

07:35.271 --> 07:39.054
- Why didn't you use that out front?
- Well, it's a little conspicuous.

07:39.342 --> 07:41.942
And I'm so stoned
I forgot that I had it.

07:45.376 --> 07:46.376
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

07:51.827 --> 07:54.377
They definitely skipped town,
all right.

07:57.114 --> 08:00.914
I'll check the kitchen for clues.
You check the bathroom and bedroom.

08:03.658 --> 08:06.313
What are you gonna do, find
a turkey baster with fingerprints on it?

08:06.438 --> 08:09.238
Man, I don't know.
That's what detectives do.

08:09.752 --> 08:12.530
We gotta case a joint,
follow protocol.

08:14.943 --> 08:18.343
The only thing I found
was this unopened kombucha.

08:19.038 --> 08:21.637
I can't believe they left it behind.
This stuff's really expensive.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.306
Look what I found...

08:23.431 --> 08:24.881
Lady shaving cream.

08:25.053 --> 08:26.895
I could use some of this stuff

08:27.273 --> 08:28.769
for my neck under my beard.

08:28.894 --> 08:31.009
I usually use soap.
It looks like shit.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.159
I'm glad I found this.
I've got really bad dry-mouth.

08:34.284 --> 08:35.500
What's this?

08:37.082 --> 08:39.217
There are papers in here.

08:40.905 --> 08:43.522
Why do I always believe the labels
on this health-food stuff?

08:44.184 --> 08:46.733
I think the writers they use
are really good, very convincing.

08:47.951 --> 08:50.542
There's nothing
with a forwarding address.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.740
I really just wanted to get Michelle
pregnant and make her happy.

08:54.235 --> 08:56.034
Why don't you just try with Leah?

08:56.797 --> 08:59.663
She doesn't want any more kids.
And she wouldn't want any with me.

09:00.175 --> 09:02.275
- Why not?
- Because I'm broke.

09:02.532 --> 09:03.917
She's giving me an allowance.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.182
I can hardly pay
for all the DVDs I've been buying.

09:06.307 --> 09:07.838
How much is she giving you?

09:08.058 --> 09:10.757
Well, more than the two girls,
but they're four and six.

09:12.062 --> 09:13.212
Look at this.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.890
- Something with my name on it.
- Let me see this.

09:18.135 --> 09:21.321
"Beth Handler and Annie Sklaver,
Tavia O'neal and Shelby Hernandez,

09:21.446 --> 09:23.106
Dawn Miller and Samantha Bryant. "

09:23.231 --> 09:25.221
There must be 30 couples on here,
all female.

09:25.346 --> 09:26.273
500 bucks.

09:28.642 --> 09:30.395
They've been selling my sperm.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.170
Oh, shit, you're right.

09:33.248 --> 09:35.211
Let's get out of here.
We'll study this later.

09:35.336 --> 09:37.085
I have to have dinner with George.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.077
Why are they selling my sperm?

09:39.443 --> 09:41.207
What are you doing
in this apartment?

09:41.841 --> 09:43.679
Call the super.
We have intruders.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.044
Everything's okay.
We're not doing anything. I'm jewish.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.212
Call 911!

09:48.935 --> 09:50.438
Get out of my way!

09:52.156 --> 09:53.956
Oh god, I twisted my knee.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.946
Why were you running
down the street?

10:14.669 --> 10:17.377
Well, it's crazy,
but it's not my fault.

10:18.131 --> 10:19.701
Ray got in trouble with some hasids.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.912
He hurt his knee.
And they called 911 on us.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.331
No one's ever called 911 on me.
It's very scary.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.542
What are you talking about?
Are you stoned?

10:27.829 --> 10:29.278
Hey, who's this?

10:31.039 --> 10:32.448
I didn't know you had a dog.

10:32.573 --> 10:34.011
- What's his name?
- Philip.

10:34.136 --> 10:35.467
I got him to get over you.

10:37.545 --> 10:39.846
You replaced me
with a little white dog named Philip?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.518
But you could have held on to me.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.459
I'm not neutered. I don't beg for food.
I don't have to be walked.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.713
You're obviously stoned and I...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.899
Let's go.
Those hasids got a good look at us.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.276
Okay, one second.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.126
Here.

10:56.858 --> 10:58.558
Suzanne, wait wait wait.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.634
You forgot these.

11:04.043 --> 11:06.790
- I fucked things up with her again.
- At least you're consistent.

11:12.819 --> 11:15.676
So you think that these women
are selling Ray's sperm

11:15.801 --> 11:19.429
on some kind of, what,
lesbian black market?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.930
Yes, he may have
as many as 30 children.

11:22.119 --> 11:23.621
You know something?
I envy him.

11:23.746 --> 11:25.559
I always wanted a big family,

11:25.876 --> 11:28.520
to be a patriarch like Tolstoy.

11:29.065 --> 11:33.065
I sometimes do wonder if I have
children out there that I don't know.

11:34.004 --> 11:36.704
I had a lot of one-night stands
in the '70s

11:38.321 --> 11:39.621
and in the '80s.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.460
Also the '60s.

11:44.012 --> 11:45.012
Jesus...

11:45.712 --> 11:47.247
I've been fucking forever.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.497
I was conceived in the late '70s.

11:49.622 --> 11:51.938
Excuse me, Mr. Christopher.
A note for you.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.960
Antrem wants us
to join him for a drink.

12:07.298 --> 12:09.384
- When did he ooze in here?
- I don't know,

12:09.509 --> 12:11.323
but he's with Louis Greene.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.774
That guy wrote a really bad review
of my novel.

12:14.102 --> 12:15.108
Little bastard.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.310
Well, come on,

12:17.500 --> 12:20.098
let's face these assholes, shall we?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.112
Why are you and Antrem such enemies?

12:23.431 --> 12:25.428
Because he's in love with me,

12:25.553 --> 12:27.303
which is why he hates me.

12:27.617 --> 12:30.248
It's why he married
my second wife Priscilla...

12:30.808 --> 12:32.709
So he could be close to me

12:32.877 --> 12:34.051
and yet crush me.

12:34.690 --> 12:36.071
Thank you.
You ready?

12:41.882 --> 12:44.054
Sit down, would you?
Have a seat, please.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.765
Sorry, we have reservations.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.474
- We're taking off.
- What a shame.

12:47.699 --> 12:49.976
Hi, it's Louis Greene.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

12:50.611 --> 12:53.605
It's Jonathan Ames.
Lovely to see you, how are you?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.644
- Hello, Louis.
- You two know each other?

12:55.769 --> 12:58.151
- Sure.
- Louis reviewed my novel in <i>Slate</i>.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.335
I believe the headline was

13:00.460 --> 13:03.031
"Next time, Jonathan,
try writing with both hands".

13:04.284 --> 13:06.488
That's a good line.
What's it mean?

13:07.328 --> 13:09.250
That I was masturbating
while typing.

13:10.069 --> 13:12.292
- My mother read that review.
- Think of it this way...

13:12.417 --> 13:15.100
At least your novel
produced one memorable phrase.

13:15.225 --> 13:16.875
I happened to write it.

13:17.393 --> 13:20.227
George, sit down, please.
There's something I need to tell you.

13:20.352 --> 13:21.352
All right.

13:22.319 --> 13:25.721
Maybe you don't know, but Molly Brooks
has been a widow for a few months now.

13:26.051 --> 13:28.098
Give her a call.
Priscilla thinks it's a great idea.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.892
What are you talking about?
Molly's in her early 70s.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.812
You can't keep dating
women half your age forever.

13:33.989 --> 13:35.601
Priscilla's worried about you.

13:35.726 --> 13:37.691
What if you slip in the shower,
break a hip?

13:38.055 --> 13:39.776
This is what you wanted
to talkabout?

13:39.995 --> 13:43.061
No, that's just the personal stuff.
Listen, I need to give you a heads up...

13:43.186 --> 13:46.575
We're gonna be doing a coffee-table book
with random house.

13:46.752 --> 13:50.264
- I'm doing all the writing.
- It is an update of your old guide

13:50.630 --> 13:52.164
<i>What you need to know New York</i>.

13:52.950 --> 13:54.195
Ours is gonna be called

13:54.320 --> 13:56.324
- "What you need to know now".
- Now.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.837
If they're doing an update,
why didn't they come to me?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.578
They must have heard
that <i>Edition</i> might be going under.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.395
No, that is not true.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.051
- Good news.
- What a relief.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.774
I had read that <i>Edition</i>
had to reduce its page count by 15%.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.620
That's it.
We're out of here.

14:11.345 --> 14:13.852
Jonathan, are you working
on a new book?

14:14.589 --> 14:15.987
Yes, I am.

14:16.281 --> 14:18.064
And it's coming along really well.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.609
Good. I'll look forward
to reading it then.

14:24.007 --> 14:25.530
I'll email you Molly's number.

14:29.913 --> 14:32.329
How can you just sit there?
This is serious.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.998
- Those women stole your D.N.A.
- Who cares?

14:35.551 --> 14:37.490
Let's just pretend
it never happened.

14:39.339 --> 14:41.682
See? I've forgotten already.
Let's smoke some pot or something.

14:41.807 --> 14:44.090
No, I want you
to do something about this.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.828
- We're gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?

14:46.953 --> 14:49.638
Call the cops and tell them my D.N.A.
was sold at a pawnshop?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.239
You don't need the cops.
You've got me.

14:52.364 --> 14:54.935
Now we should track down
all the women on this sheet

14:55.255 --> 14:58.759
and see if any of them know anything
that could lead us to Lisa and Michelle.

14:59.348 --> 15:02.017
I did that already.
No one is listed in the phone book.

15:02.142 --> 15:03.877
They all have cell phones.

15:04.002 --> 15:06.287
I don't even know why they
make phone books anymore.

15:06.671 --> 15:09.711
I think the two of you
should go door to door

15:09.836 --> 15:11.883
and hunt these criminals down.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.496
I can't believe
they did this to you.

15:15.773 --> 15:17.773
I feel like I've been robbed.

15:18.401 --> 15:20.877
- But it's my sperm.
- Yeah, but your sperm is my sperm.

15:21.843 --> 15:23.530
- Really?
- Yes.

15:27.098 --> 15:29.171
I should get my sperm
stolen more often.

15:30.898 --> 15:32.298
What do you think?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.811
They never should have messed
with my friend's semen.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.600
I can't believe I fired 30 blanks.

16:34.724 --> 16:36.224
I'm a sterile loser.

16:37.292 --> 16:38.793
It's because I smoke too much pot.

16:38.918 --> 16:41.179
- The government was right.
- You're not a loser.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.548
The cooler probably didn't
freeze the sperm right, okay?

16:44.673 --> 16:47.762
Look, there's still one couple left
out in Ditmas park.

16:47.887 --> 16:49.390
We can go there tomorrow.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.412
Shit, it's my editor.

16:54.995 --> 16:57.891
- Hello, Caroline. How are you?
- <i>I'm good.</i>

16:58.059 --> 16:59.362
I wanted to check in.

16:59.487 --> 17:01.284
You're a month away
from your deadline.

17:01.409 --> 17:02.905
How's the work coming?

17:03.204 --> 17:04.481
<i>Well, very good.</i>

17:04.819 --> 17:07.134
The narrator is going through

17:07.259 --> 17:09.694
a lot of emotional pain
and mental pain.

17:09.974 --> 17:10.795
Why?

17:10.920 --> 17:14.657
I thought it was a comedy about a man's
failed journey through the Kama Sutra.

17:15.056 --> 17:17.269
Well, the failure
is upsetting to him.

17:17.394 --> 17:18.787
<i>Okay, that sounds good.</i>

17:18.959 --> 17:21.335
You know, I was looking
at this Kama Sutra stuff

17:21.460 --> 17:23.526
on the internet for the book jacket

17:23.651 --> 17:26.377
and I have to say
I was very aroused.

17:26.757 --> 17:29.608
<i>My husband was a terrific lover</i>

17:30.154 --> 17:31.404
before he died,

17:31.782 --> 17:33.658
but I have to say
there were some things

17:33.783 --> 17:35.970
we definitely did not try.

17:37.538 --> 17:39.290
That's wonderful, Caroline.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.356
<i>Honey, I've got another call.</i>

17:41.481 --> 17:43.520
I'll talk to you later.
Big kiss.

17:50.339 --> 17:51.486
I'm doomed.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.490
My novel's due in a month
and I only have one sentence.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.365
And I don't even like it.

17:57.761 --> 17:59.953
Even that building
is laughing at me.

18:01.593 --> 18:05.090
Do you think the architect purposely
made it look like a gigantic cock?

18:06.941 --> 18:08.241
To humiliate me.

18:21.139 --> 18:23.739
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I was out all day helping Ray.

18:23.864 --> 18:25.979
Come here, come here.
Sit down.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.144
Read this.
Tell me what you think.

18:28.269 --> 18:30.284
It's this week's editorial.

18:30.409 --> 18:31.818
I've got to email that in.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.886
The deadline was half
an hour ago, so hurry up.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.573
This is too much.
You'll be sued.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.532
"Richard Antrem has the brainpower
of someone with tertiary syphilis,

18:41.657 --> 18:44.910
"the penis of a hermaphrodite and the
moral judgment of a subnormal pinhead. "

18:45.124 --> 18:47.959
- You can't publish it as an editorial.
- Why not? It's all true.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.861
But it's libel, slander.

18:50.876 --> 18:52.088
And it's really long.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.675
Did you write this all of today?
I haven't written this much in months.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.469
It's easy when you're inspired.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.510
Keep reading.

19:04.472 --> 19:05.935
Okay, you can't do this.

19:06.366 --> 19:09.493
You say that he has a mouth
like the anus of a starfish

19:09.618 --> 19:12.442
and that he's been suspected
of plagiarism his whole career.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.944
Yeah, so let him try
to prove any of it's untrue.

19:19.347 --> 19:20.784
You remember when you told me

19:20.952 --> 19:23.632
that I needed to be sane
when you were insane?

19:23.757 --> 19:25.663
I don't remember.
What's the matter with you?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.078
It'll be a great issue...

19:27.203 --> 19:29.888
My editorial and the comic
that you did with Ray.

19:31.278 --> 19:33.155
I know Antrem torments you,

19:33.516 --> 19:36.800
but you attack <i>GQ</i>
calling it a women's magazine.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.338
I've had it, really. Seriously,
I can't take it anymore.

19:39.463 --> 19:43.431
They're like a classic playground bully
and you know how you deal with bullies?

19:43.709 --> 19:45.194
- Tell the teacher?
- No no.

19:45.319 --> 19:47.727
You fight back.
You kick 'em in the balls.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.620
Publishing this
is something he would do.

19:53.096 --> 19:54.096
It's not.

19:54.859 --> 19:56.669
It wouldn't be as well written.

19:56.794 --> 19:57.794
And send.

20:09.055 --> 20:11.255
Maybe it's best that I'm sterile.

20:11.726 --> 20:12.809
Don't say that.

20:12.934 --> 20:14.811
I'd make a lousy father anyway.

20:14.936 --> 20:17.187
I couldn't tell a child
all the lies you need to feed them.

20:17.312 --> 20:20.194
- Like what?
- Like 18 years of school is fun.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.068
And that crushing your spirit

20:22.193 --> 20:24.721
to fit in with the rest of the world
is a good thing.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.651
I don't know.
I'd like to have a kid someday.

20:28.176 --> 20:30.015
Except I'd be worry
about that soft spot

20:30.140 --> 20:31.558
on top of their head.

20:31.683 --> 20:33.898
I'd want them to wear
a bicycle helmet all the time.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.188
Wait, soft spot?
What's a soft spot?

20:36.313 --> 20:38.525
The soft spot is like...
It's a very dangerous part

20:38.650 --> 20:39.966
on top of a baby's head.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.456
If you touch on it
it can go right to the brain.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.411
I'll do all the talking.

20:56.044 --> 20:57.380
- Yes?
- Renee Dalton?

20:57.669 --> 20:58.668
Who's asking?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.842
My name is Jonathan Ames.
I'm a private detective.

21:01.049 --> 21:02.861
I'm sorry, what do you want?

21:02.986 --> 21:04.797
My associate and I
have reason to believe

21:04.922 --> 21:07.390
that you may have been
sold illegally obtained sperm.

21:07.911 --> 21:09.350
We'd like to know two things:

21:09.717 --> 21:11.745
do you know are the people
who sold the sperm,

21:11.870 --> 21:13.420
and are you pregnant?

21:14.407 --> 21:16.683
- How did you get my name?
- From the apartment of two women

21:16.808 --> 21:18.818
known to us as Lisa and Michelle...

21:19.323 --> 21:22.364
Real names Margaret Duckett
and Ellen Willis.

21:22.505 --> 21:25.883
My associate actually is the man
whose sperm was stolen by these two.

21:26.008 --> 21:27.702
What's going on?
Who are you?

21:27.951 --> 21:29.913
I'm Jonathan Ames.
I'm a private detective.

21:30.264 --> 21:32.053
Show me some identification.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.751
I'm not officially
a private detective,

21:34.876 --> 21:37.146
but I do have a New Jersey
driver's license.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.351
- Let's go in the house.
- They're here about the sperm we used.

21:40.585 --> 21:41.935
It came from him.

21:43.597 --> 21:45.215
They know Lisa and Michelle.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.181
I'm pregnant with this guy's baby?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.849
- You're pregnant?
- It's early.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.808
- We're not really telling anyone yet.
- That's so exciting.

21:54.527 --> 21:57.232
- That's great that you're pregnant.
- This is bullshit.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.774
We're very happy.
This is what we wanted.

22:00.955 --> 22:02.040
What do you do?

22:02.165 --> 22:04.489
The donor was supposed
to be PhD from Stanford.

22:04.989 --> 22:06.799
I went to the university of Albany.

22:06.924 --> 22:09.004
I studied art.
I'm a cartoonist.

22:09.585 --> 22:11.162
Are you at least a vegan?

22:11.740 --> 22:14.207
We were told the donor would have
very little mercury in his sperm.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.876
Well, I eat fish.
And I eat a lot of meat...

22:18.295 --> 22:20.626
A lot of meat.
But I've had two colonics.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.128
Oh my God, you were supposed to
be a vegan with an average build.

22:24.491 --> 22:25.946
I do have an average build.

22:26.071 --> 22:29.013
I don't believe this. I feel like
Mia Farrow in <i>Rosemary's baby</i>.

22:29.199 --> 22:31.449
Oh, sweetheart, it's not that bad.

22:31.974 --> 22:33.476
Okay, you two get off my porch

22:34.020 --> 22:36.768
- or I'll call 911.
- Don't call 911. I hate 911.

22:37.175 --> 22:38.443
You should be happy.

22:38.568 --> 22:40.521
Ray is a great guy.
He's a wonderful friend.

22:40.646 --> 22:42.399
And I'm sure he has
incredible D.N.A.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.738
I do have good D.N.A. There's
Crohn's disease on my mom's side, but...

22:45.906 --> 22:47.780
Don't ever contact us again.

22:47.905 --> 22:50.705
You're to have nothing
to do with this child.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.458
Come on.

22:52.583 --> 22:53.565
I'm so sorry.

22:54.101 --> 22:55.349
Find me on facebook.

22:59.418 --> 23:00.818
I'm having a baby.

23:01.531 --> 23:03.256
The mother of my child hates me.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.139
It's kind of one of those...

23:08.404 --> 23:09.358
Papa.

23:11.942 --> 23:13.292
Get off my porch.

23:21.642 --> 23:23.250
To your first collaboration.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.125
And to not being sterile.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.565
To having a child
with a woman who hates me.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.240
Here's to being
just like my own father.

23:30.694 --> 23:33.077
Nice editorial, George.
I can't stand Antrem.

23:33.448 --> 23:35.663
I loved that line
about the starfish anus.

23:35.871 --> 23:37.540
I just report what I see, gentlemen.

23:41.579 --> 23:43.138
I challenge this man.

23:44.643 --> 23:45.993
To what, Richard,

23:46.331 --> 23:48.376
arm-wrestling, a spelling bee?

23:49.088 --> 23:51.971
When I was at Oxford
on my Rhodes scholarship,

23:52.708 --> 23:54.633
we would have settled this
in the ring...

23:55.291 --> 23:56.476
Queensberry rules.

23:57.282 --> 24:00.024
I challenge you to a boxing match,

24:00.940 --> 24:02.190
you old piece of shit.

24:02.907 --> 24:05.934
I don't mind saying that was
a horrible piece of writing.

24:06.059 --> 24:08.613
It was indulgent and cowardly...

24:09.114 --> 24:10.656
Louis, just stay out of it.

24:11.609 --> 24:14.320
I've known you for 25 years, Antrem,

24:14.860 --> 24:17.852
and I've wanted to hit you
for 25 years.

24:17.977 --> 24:19.916
I happily accept your challenge.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.334
And so do I.

24:24.583 --> 24:25.976
I'll fight Louis.

24:26.808 --> 24:29.258
- Say "I accept".
- I accept.

24:30.037 --> 24:31.781
What about me?
I want to fight.
