08:21.001 --> 08:22.334
All of our favorite
songs of his--

08:22.336 --> 08:24.436
That's when they came from,
right?

08:24.438 --> 08:26.338
Okay, our favorite bands
of all time--

08:26.340 --> 08:29.641
The stones, the ramones,
the replacements, us. Huh?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.510
They were high when they were
doing their best stuff.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.813
I mean, john lennon, high,
wrote<i> imagine,</i>

08:34.815 --> 08:37.482
And then<i> strawberry fields</i>
and<i> revolution.</i>

08:37.484 --> 08:39.784
Okay, john lennon, straight,
on his last album,

08:39.786 --> 08:42.020
Wrote a three-minute song
about bakin' a loaf of bread.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.456
I repeat--
baking a loaf of bread.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.991
Okay, he'd gotten so boring,

08:45.993 --> 08:47.459
If mark david chapman
hadn't shot him,

08:47.461 --> 08:49.961
Yoko probably would've.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.530
Guys,
it's not gonna work.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.465
It's called sex and drugs
and rock and roll.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.201
It's not, you know, yeast and
water and dinner [bleep] rolls.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.371
Name one great band or rock star
that doesn't get high.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.205
- Coldplay.
- Morrissey.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.506
Radiohead?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.208
I rest my case.
Okay?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.976
God, every time i hear
a radiohead song

09:04.978 --> 09:07.212
I feel like i'm failing
the sats all over again.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.814
And listen, guys,
i've never written a song

09:09.816 --> 09:13.518
Without some kind
of chemical assistance, ever.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.322
John, roll the dice.
See what happens.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.558
Do it for me, dad.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.894
Oh, god.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.870
Maybe you guys
are right.

09:31.872 --> 09:36.508
Maybe it's time--
time to try something else.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.310
I'll give it a shot.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.515
Yep.
[sighs]

09:43.517 --> 09:44.783
(all)
hey!

09:50.190 --> 09:51.222
(ava)
okay, i cleaned out
the hard liquor today,

09:51.224 --> 09:52.857
Except for all of this wine,

09:52.859 --> 09:54.859
And i am going to drink
every single bottle

09:54.861 --> 09:56.394
Because i love you,
honey.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.429
Proud of you, dad.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.730
Where are you sleeping?

09:58.732 --> 09:59.898
I'll be guarding
the front door.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.566
How do i know that
for sure?

10:01.568 --> 10:03.368
Well, if you wake up later
and manage to slip out to a bar,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.036
That means i'm sleeping
in gigi's room.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.738
Which means
he won't be sleeping.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.407
Which means i'll be sitting
in that chair right over there.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.442
Which means
you can watch.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.310
Ooh.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.551
Why are you
such a drag, man?

10:19.553 --> 10:22.420
I'm a drag?
[chuckles]

10:22.422 --> 10:24.456
You hit the lottery
here, asshole.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.125
I mean, mickey split
'cause family's not her bag,

10:27.127 --> 10:30.428
But ava--she obviously
digs this setup.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.632
In spite of yourself,
your ego, your drug abuse,

10:33.634 --> 10:37.268
You end up with a smokin'-hot
chick who loves you,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.404
Your old band
back together again,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.272
And a super talented
daughter

10:41.274 --> 10:45.143
Who just might drive your ass
back into actual show business.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.278
Yeah, if my songwriting partner
and lead guitar player

10:47.280 --> 10:49.247
Doesn't blow it all up
by sleeping with her first.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.249
Hey, man, there's
a genuine connection

10:51.251 --> 10:52.584
Between me and gigi.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.752
Yeah, there's
a genuine connection

10:53.754 --> 10:55.253
Between her ass
and your pants.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.588
There's a ton of great
long-term couples

10:56.590 --> 10:58.490
In the history
of rock and roll

10:58.492 --> 11:00.592
Whose sexual chemistry
made the bands even better.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.594
There's only one--
hall & oates.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.262
Kim gordon, thurston moore.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.597
Who no longer
speak to each other

11:05.599 --> 11:06.965
Or anybody else
in their band.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.433
I don't care what period
in rock and roll

11:08.435 --> 11:09.434
You want to talk about--

11:09.436 --> 11:12.137
Sonny and cher,
abba, blondie,

11:12.139 --> 11:14.272
The white stripes,
sonic youth, huh?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.974
It never works out.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.275
The benatars.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.443
Pat benatar?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.311
Her and her husband,

11:20.313 --> 11:22.447
Longtime songwriting partner,
lead guitar player.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.116
35 years, going strong.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.619
And his name is?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.521
Ben?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.456
Ben benatar?

11:31.458 --> 11:34.025
No, it--i mean, pat.
They're both named pat.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.695
His name is neil giraldo,

11:36.697 --> 11:39.164
Also known as the guy
standing behind pat benatar

11:39.166 --> 11:41.132
That nobody
pays attention to,

11:41.134 --> 11:44.302
Also known as
mr. Pat benatar.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.471
But look at the bright side,
you know,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.373
If you do sleep with gigi
and then the band breaks up

11:48.375 --> 11:50.141
And she leaves you behind,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.876
You got a great name
for a chain of hair salons.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.547
Mr. Gigi's.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.559
Hey.
What about that?

12:07.561 --> 12:08.893
No.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.731
Got nothin'.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.200
I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.068
[inhales sharply]

12:17.070 --> 12:18.570
[blows raspberry]

12:18.572 --> 12:21.740
You guys wanted me
clean and sober.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.203
How's it goin'?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.371
Do you want
some weed?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.906
Not funny.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.574
You want me to do
the pen thing again?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.076
[pen clicking]

12:58.078 --> 12:59.778
Radiohead to morrissey, huh?

12:59.780 --> 13:02.247
All righty.
That's what you asked for.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.254
Couple of vicodins maybe?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.756
I have a ton of inderal.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.457
I'll take some of that.
What does that do?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.592
- It's my heart medication.
- Oh, jesus christ.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.427
Helps with my arrhythmia.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.762
You don't have any
pain killers or anything?

Listen to me,
you're just jonesing.

- It will pass.

You don't take
anything anymore?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.269
- I take yoga.
- Oh, god.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.771
What, you can't picture
me doing yoga?

13:59.773 --> 14:01.272
Oh, no, no--i can picture
you doing yoga,

14:01.274 --> 14:02.607
But getting that picture
out of my head

14:02.609 --> 14:04.142
Is another reason i need
chemical assistance.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.510
Jesus, you in yoga pants?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.679
Man camel toe--bameltoe?
No, no thank you.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.480
That's a four-jameson job
right there.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.282
Have you ever heard
of "the art of now"?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.284

is it an art tatum record?

No, it's a life movement.

You need to get open,
john.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.862
The answers to these questions
that you're asking yourself--

14:23.864 --> 14:26.631
They don't lie
at the bottom of a bottle

14:26.633 --> 14:28.333
Or the end of a rolled-up
dollar bill.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.534
You know where they lie?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.502
Right here.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.838
You got to cure
the addiction. I did.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.140
And so can you,
and i can help you, brother.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.976
The booze,
the blow, the weed--

14:37.978 --> 14:40.144
They were all
emotional crutches for me,

14:40.146 --> 14:43.348
Until i cast them aside
and learned to walk again,

14:43.350 --> 14:46.985
A free, clear,
fully grown man.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.319

Hot--ow, ooh.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.159
Watch out, watch out.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.394
Are those tater tots?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.562
No.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.864
These are gluten-free
tater tots.

14:59.866 --> 15:00.865
Can you get me
the ketchup?

15:00.867 --> 15:03.334

I can't reach.

Hot, hot.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.010
Hey, re,
how you doing?

15:12.012 --> 15:13.845
What?

15:13.847 --> 15:14.579
Nothing, just checking
on how you're doing

15:14.581 --> 15:15.680
And what's going on.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.582
- I'm fine.
- Cool.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.184
New axe? 'cause it's--
whew, it's killer.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.920
Same one i played
in the heathens.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.521
Oh, i--
it's just that it's so--

15:23.523 --> 15:24.923
You keep it so,
you know, shiny,

15:24.925 --> 15:28.092
It just looks like...

15:28.094 --> 15:29.961
Brand-new.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.265
I just--
i don't understand.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.434
There's always this weird,
you know, like, vibe between us.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.369
I don't--
i don't know why.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.538
Which one, like, the anger vibe
or the animosity vibe?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.907
Here's my current one:
I don't have any drugs.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.375
Who said anything
about drugs, dude? I

15:44.377 --> 15:46.377
Can't just walk in here
and tell my favorite bass player

15:46.379 --> 15:47.545
Of all time,
which is what--

15:47.547 --> 15:49.380
Bam texted me
30 seconds ago.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.416
I know you have pills
in one of these bags here, man,

15:51.418 --> 15:53.551
So don't tell me
that you don't, huh?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.754
They're prescription pills
prescribed by my doctor

15:56.756 --> 15:58.056
- For very specific reasons.
- Yeah.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.891
Come on, johnny!
Listen to me.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.727
Oh, jesus, what's your
doctor's name, duane reade?

16:02.729 --> 16:04.228
This is what keeps me
clean and sober.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.230
I'll bet. What the hell
are they all for, dude?

16:06.232 --> 16:08.633
Well, these kill panic.
These kill anxiety.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.234
These keep me
from killing myself.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.103
These keep me
from killing you.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.238
These keep the voices
at bay.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.473
You hear voices?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.975
I do.
I hear voices.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.576
Do you want to know
what they're saying?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.445
"give johnny
some percocets"?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.146
[chuckles]
these voices are

16:22.148 --> 16:25.783
From a very old age, my friend,
and they wish to sing,

16:25.785 --> 16:29.253
So i wrote them
a song cycle.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.823
What do you mean, like, a--
like a rock opera?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.925
Rock operas ain't hip
no more, bro.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.760
Song cycles--
uber hip.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.295
Yeah, right. I forgot
we live in brooklyn.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.463
Dig this.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.931
It's about the famine.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.165
The famine?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.935
Ireland, 1845.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.603
The awful blight
upon the potato crop?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.472
It's called<i> an gorta mor.</i>

16:47.474 --> 16:50.842
Oh. Is that, like, the name
of the main guy, like<i> tommy?</i>

16:50.844 --> 16:54.345
