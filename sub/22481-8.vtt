WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.236
* Jingle bells, jingle bells

00:02.270 --> 00:05.039
* Jingle all the way

00:05.073 --> 00:10.111
* Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a '57 Chevrolet *

00:10.144 --> 00:13.647
* Jingle bells, jingle, jingle

00:13.681 --> 00:15.383
* Jingle all the way

00:15.416 --> 00:18.119
* Oh, what fun it is to ride

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
* In a one-horse
open sleigh... *

00:20.554 --> 00:22.123
It's a nice,
little turnout.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.457
Gonna get
a lot of donations.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.793
The guy on your 12 o'clock
is Sanjay Singh.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.695
His company just went public.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.331
MUMFORD:
Sounds rich.
He owns that
video game company, right?

00:30.364 --> 00:34.268
And about 20 other things
worth billions with a "B."

00:34.302 --> 00:36.137
Sanjay.
Hey.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.139
Meet our SWAT team leaders,
Sergeant Harrelson

00:38.172 --> 00:39.573
and Sergeant Mumford.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.143
Hey, that truck
y'all ride in...
Black Betty.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.677
Yeah, any chance I could drive
it around the parking lot?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.346
I'm researching a new game.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.814
For the right donation
to the Children's Hospital,

00:46.847 --> 00:48.182
we'll let you blast the siren.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.151
Awesome. I brought
my checkbook.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.585
I knew you'd come through
for us, Sanjay.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.587
Yeah.
SERVER:
Drinks?

00:53.621 --> 00:55.723
Thank you. Cheers.
Cheers.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.325
* Oh, what fun it is to ride

00:57.358 --> 00:59.760
* In a one-horse open sleigh

00:59.793 --> 01:02.363
* Oh.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.817
Tequila shots,
two blunts...

01:23.851 --> 01:25.353
And four lines of coke.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.487
Mm, how much for you?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.289
Learn the rules, sir.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.691
You can buy the drinks and
the drugs, but not the girls.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.293
Hey, listen up.
Two shots.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.362
Buy one, get one free.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.867
Diego. Some tequila, amigo?

01:39.900 --> 01:41.702
No.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.537
Mm, what
about you, Joaquin?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.306
You want a shot?
They're two for one.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.376
Cállate. Go away.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.814
*

02:05.493 --> 02:06.627
Don't stare, Reya.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.795
That's El Malo.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.897
He's known for
killing people

02:09.930 --> 02:12.333
just for looking at
him the wrong way.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.369
What did he do?

02:15.403 --> 02:18.906
I don't know, but
it's best not to ask.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.542
*

02:59.947 --> 03:02.816
*

03:28.776 --> 03:31.245
*

04:10.484 --> 04:11.919
Aah! What are you doing?

04:20.027 --> 04:22.730
OFFICER: Police!
Put your weapons down!

04:36.744 --> 04:39.647
Let's get you good people
locked up.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.983
You want to get cuffed,
too, for charity?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.719
Of course Hicks is sucking up
to Michael Plank.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.487
HONDO:
I know that name.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.988
President of the
police commission?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.990
Yup. Highest ranking
civilian in the room.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.696
Can I tell you how sexy you look
in that dress right now?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.731
Not until the party ends.
Well, later tonight,

04:57.765 --> 04:58.999
that dress and everything
under it is coming off.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.435
Who said there's
anything under it?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.872
You know Captain Cortez.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.474
Always a pleasure, Captain.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.741
HICKS: Commissioner Plank,
this is Sergeant...

05:07.775 --> 05:08.876
Sergeant Harrelson.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.611
Officer who made that sniper
shot from a SWAT helicopter.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.679
Great work.
Thank you.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.414
But I had a lot of help
from my team on the ground.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.548
HICKS: Oh, it was an
impressive operation

05:14.582 --> 05:16.116
from top to bottom.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.851
Maybe I can talk you into
trying for captain one day.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.687
I appreciate that,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.088
but you could say
I already have my dream job.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.590
I'd love to hear
the details

05:22.623 --> 05:24.091
on that op that didn't
make the papers.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.693
Well, I got to warn you, you ask
a cop for his glory stories,

05:25.726 --> 05:26.960
you can only believe
half of what he says.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.529
That's...

05:30.798 --> 05:32.366
Shots fired.
Officer in trouble.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.101
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.469
My guys are ready.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.704
I'll have more intel
in a minute.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.838
Mumford, I'm geared
up. I want in.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.540
Always room for one more.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.979
Interested in seeing
firsthand what SWAT does?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.053
Got an officer under fire.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.122
Unis can't get to him.
You know what that means.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.125
Time for a little bah humbug
for the bad guys.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.627
Sounds like bullets
flying in the casita.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.829
The gangbanger guards
in those places

06:01.862 --> 06:03.764
are mean sons of bitches,
so go in heavy.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.699
Anything to add, Hondo?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.901
It's your party.
I'm just along for the ride.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.797
MUMFORD:
Let's get you out of here.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.037
50-David to Command.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.040
Officer secure.
20-David, report status.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.610
20-David. Approaching target.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.844
Watch your cross fire.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.621
HONDO:
Put it down.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.992
Suspect down.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.431
Situation secure.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.237
What the hell did these clowns
decide to die for?

07:17.270 --> 07:21.208
What were the three gifts the
Wise Men brought to Bethlehem?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.643
Frankincense.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.544
Myrrh.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.545
And gold.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.583
*

08:05.553 --> 08:07.220
Mumford's team
is working the witnesses,

08:07.254 --> 08:09.790
but this has all the signs
of a casita robbery gone bad.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.559
Casita?
Underground bars.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.660
HONDO:
Cash only.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.261
Drinks, drugs, gambling,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.564
pretty girls called ficheras
to keep the party going.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.632
It's pretty much
a poor man's Vegas.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.133
Can't Vice close them down?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.569
Casitas are like weeds.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.070
Shut one down,
another takes its place.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.038
Who runs them?
This one?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.206
I'm guessing drug cartel.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.741
How do you know that?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.242
The shooter had a bag
full of gold.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.544
Now, unless he's Santa Claus,

08:30.578 --> 08:31.879
this casita
was a way station

08:31.912 --> 08:34.548
before the cartel could move
the profits to Mexico.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.149
Isn't it easier
to smuggle cash?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.552
No. The cartel buys gold
to launder its drug money.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.721
They like a paper trail
to get it past customs.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.623
Register a fake
jewelry company,

08:42.656 --> 08:43.957
add a phony invoice...

08:43.991 --> 08:45.292
And if they get stopped
at the border,

08:45.325 --> 08:46.627
they'll have papers
to show it's all legal.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.195
Exactly. Now, sir,

08:48.228 --> 08:50.263
cartel does not like
being ripped off.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.899
They're gonna want payback.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.201
All right, Hondo, I need
you to call your team in

08:54.234 --> 08:55.803
to work this with Mumford.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.639
My team's supposed to be down
for the next few days.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.574
Well...
My team can handle
this, Commander.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.344
Well, you said it.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.713
The cartel's
looking for blood.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.314
I need all hands on deck

09:07.347 --> 09:08.816
until we close this.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.851
I'll put out the call.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.919
Good.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.687
* It's beginning

09:13.721 --> 09:18.325
* To look a lot
like Christmas... *

09:18.358 --> 09:20.360
I thought you
ordered it online?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.729
I did. Three weeks ago.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.996
And then I get
an e-mail today

09:23.030 --> 09:24.264
saying they're not gonna
deliver it tomorrow.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.133
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.201
I know, and it's the only thing
Matthew wants.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.970
Last night, he prayed for one.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.605
You'd think that a toy
that shoots tiny foam cars

09:31.639 --> 09:32.606
would be easy to find.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.141
I called the mall. Nothing.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.743
Well, there's got to be one
in this city somewhere.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.711
I'll handle it.
Daddy, Daddy.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.180
Look, it's a picture of
me with the Nerf Nitro.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.353
* But the prettiest thing
to see... *

09:46.386 --> 09:47.888
I thought the team
was off for the holiday.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.024
Yeah. I'm not sure
what's going on.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.160
ANNIE:
David.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395
Forget something?
Yeah, sorry.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.130
Deacon at work,
David at home, my bad.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.298
Hey, let me see that.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.268
Now, that is a
fantastic picture.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.970
I'm gonna put this up
in my locker at work.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.037
Okay.
Come on.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.173
Bring it in. Hugs.
You be good.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.742
* Can hardly wait
for school to start again... *

10:08.776 --> 10:11.311
Take care.
Piece of cake.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.013
* Look a lot like Christmas...

10:14.347 --> 10:16.049
You guys want to help?
Yeah.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.284
All right.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.319
TAN: We know which cartel
ran the casita?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.054
Not yet. Mumford's team
is working on it.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.323
But we do know the cartel
will turn this city upside-down

10:23.356 --> 10:25.392
trying to find their loot,
so we need to move fast.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.027
You know, I got an ex-C.I.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.729
Ran with a Mexican cartel.
He might know something.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.863
HONDO:
Okay, work it.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.031
Take Tan and Luca.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.332
Share anything you find
with Mumford.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.267
Okay. We got intel
on the missing thief?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.435
JESSICA:
Witness says two men--

10:35.468 --> 10:37.137
Joaquin and Diego--
did the job.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.306
We took out Joaquin, but Diego
escaped before we arrived.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.408
He got away with the rest
of the cartel gold.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.911
No last name on Diego,
so we can't I.D. him yet.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.345
Robbery-Homicide
and Gang Unit

10:45.378 --> 10:47.047
are running
their database.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.182
One D.O.A. in the casita
was a known gang member.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.350
20th Street Diablos.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.752
HONDO:
Also, Diego may have had

10:51.785 --> 10:53.420
an accomplice,
a girl named Reya.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.088
She works at the casita.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.824
Witnesses say she was
talking to the suspects

10:56.857 --> 10:58.692
right before the
shooting started.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.960
Now, she was injured
in the robbery, bleeding badly,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.028
but then she disappeared.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.395
Sounds like a serious injury,

11:02.429 --> 11:04.297
but no local hospitals report
treating anyone

11:04.331 --> 11:06.133
in the last few hours
fitting her description.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.301
CHRIS: I got a connect who works
off the books as a street doc.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.170
She makes house calls to
people who don't want to show

11:10.203 --> 11:11.872
their faces at the hospital.
HONDO:
That's a place to start.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.240
STREET: If we know
Reya was involved,

11:13.273 --> 11:15.175
the cartel will, too.
HONDO:
No doubt.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.778
We got to find Diego and Reya
before the cartel does.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.946
Gear up.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.721
Well, there goes
my plans for tonight.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.256
PG or rated R plans?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.423
I was hoping for NC-17.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.292
You know what,
Mumford's team was up, not us.

11:33.761 --> 11:34.895
Hey.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.730
This sucks, I know.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.866
But Hicks wants to impress
the police commissioner.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.168
Yeah, as long as there's a good
reason for ruining our holiday.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.071
But I got a little something
that might help ease the pain.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.773
Hmm-- ugh.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.907
SWAT Tag.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.408
Oh!
All right.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.476
Huh?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.944
Okay.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.045
What's SWAT Tag?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.781
War, Street. All-out war.
LUCA:
Fun.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.749
Shh. What's the prize?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.084
Because it's my first time
being the referee,

11:57.117 --> 11:59.219
I had to wait until I had
something real special.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.253
All right. Come on, spit it out.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.321
HONDO: All right,
two team members

12:01.354 --> 12:03.090
get to go to New York City

12:03.123 --> 12:05.425
to advise the
NYPD on security

12:05.458 --> 12:07.160
for the Grammys...
Yes!

12:07.194 --> 12:08.328
What?
All-access pass

12:08.361 --> 12:10.864
to the greenroom,
face-to-face with the stars.
Nice.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.333
Beyoncé, sweet!
HONDO: All right,
all right,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.068
so here we go.
You know the rules.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.403
Hey, we don't know the rules.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.105
You'll catch up, Street,
just pick from the bucket.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.307
Okay, eyes closed, eyes closed.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.542
Let's see who starts out
with the golden ticket. Go.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.446
Top of my bucket list:
picture with Beyoncé.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.915
STREET:
Playing card

12:27.948 --> 12:29.516
with gold tape on it. Wow.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.251
So, break
a SWAT rule,

12:31.284 --> 12:32.953
you get tagged,

12:32.986 --> 12:34.187
lose your ticket.
Right.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.288
Your TAC gear's
not squared away,

12:35.322 --> 12:36.924
your socks aren't regulation,

12:36.957 --> 12:38.458
even the smallest violation,
you hand it over.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.993
But I don't break a rule, I win.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.094
Yep. As long as
you have the ticket

12:41.128 --> 12:42.562
at the end of the mission.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.933
STREET: I was musical chairs
champ in second grade, so...

12:45.966 --> 12:48.301
Piece of cake.
Tag. Your arm patch is crooked.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.871
You might want to tighten
that up a bit there, champ.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.207
Told you this was war.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.477
LUCA: Beyoncé.
It was, like, millimeters.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.982
CHRIS: Was hoping
you could help us.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.216
ORI:
Sure. Who you looking for?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.451
Her name is Reya.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.219
She has a pretty bad
cut on her arm.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.855
Needs stitches.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.356
You made any house calls
like that tonight?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.058
Chris, I haven't had
a human patient in months.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.459
Just paws and claws.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.827
STREET: I thought
you made your money

13:13.861 --> 13:14.862
on the side
as a street doctor.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.363
ORI:
I did,

13:16.396 --> 13:19.099
till this new guy Tommy started
undercutting my prices.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.500
I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be able

13:20.533 --> 13:21.869
to afford vet school
'cause of him.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.104
Sounds like
a dog eat dog business.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.839
I should've taken that job
on Wall Street.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.008
But I love animals.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.242
Better than humans, usually.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.944
No doubt. Do you know where

13:30.978 --> 13:32.145
we can find this Tommy at?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.513
Look for his EMS van parked

13:33.546 --> 13:35.482
behind those gin joints
near the 110.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.851
When he's got downtime
on his shifts,

13:37.885 --> 13:39.887
Tommy stitches up drunks
who get in bar brawls.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.088
HONDO:
We appreciate it.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.089
Happy holidays.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.561
*

13:48.595 --> 13:50.130
JESSICA:
Commissioner Plank.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.132
How'd you like
your first SWAT action?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.267
Michael. Please.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.904
SWAT definitely lives up
to its reputation.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.505
I just wore
a bulletproof vest over a tux

13:58.538 --> 14:00.107
to a shootout at an illegal club

14:00.140 --> 14:01.975
where drugs were being
passed around like beer nuts.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.145
Not my usual Saturday night.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.247
We made a lot of money
for Children's Hospital.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.149
Donations poured in
after the guests saw

14:09.182 --> 14:10.918
a real-life SWAT call.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.152
I bet they're all posting
selfies on Facebook,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.921
getting likes
from all their friends.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.389
Speaking of likes, I wanted
to ask you if had any thoughts

14:16.423 --> 14:18.558
or suggestions
on my policing proposals?

14:18.591 --> 14:20.060
Policing proposals?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.361
Commander Hicks
was gonna send them

14:21.394 --> 14:22.529
over to you for your thoughts?

14:22.562 --> 14:23.596
No, I'm sorry, I don't think

14:23.630 --> 14:24.597
I got anything from him.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.269
He's so busy, and it's probably
not at the top of his agenda.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.004
What were they regarding?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.405
Some ideas on how to
build more public trust

14:32.439 --> 14:34.607
with the LAPD, improve
police accountability,

14:34.641 --> 14:36.609
more outreach to
immigrant communities,

14:36.643 --> 14:37.945
mentors for female officers,

14:37.978 --> 14:39.546
anti-bias
training for cops

14:39.579 --> 14:42.149
to reduce the use of force--
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.516
Huh, usually,
it's like

14:43.550 --> 14:45.118
pulling teeth trying
to get police officials

14:45.152 --> 14:46.486
to talk about these topics.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.555
You sure they let you pass
the academy?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.657
I was the rebel
in my graduating class.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.959
I'll tell you what.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.526
I'd love to hear more.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.195
How about we cut out
the middleman,

14:55.228 --> 14:57.197
and you e-mail your proposals
directly to me?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.133
Sounds great. You're very kind.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.602
Practical. I'll take good ideas
anywhere I can find them.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.075
CHRIS:
I don't get it.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.442
How can you not like hip

15:09.476 --> 15:11.611
Well, uh, it's just
people talking,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.480
with music in the background.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.547
And even I can do that.
Okay, Street,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.616
that is the whitest thing
I've ever heard you say.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.952
Hondo, what's your go

15:18.986 --> 15:20.954
When I'm working out,
it's West Coast funk.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.056
I mean, if me and my girl
are taking care of business,

15:23.090 --> 15:24.224
you get to let jazz do

15:24.257 --> 15:25.959
what it does.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.494
When I'm chilling,
it's always the blues,

15:27.527 --> 15:29.462
and any time's the right time
for Otis Redding.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.965
Yo, Hondo.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.933
EMS van.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.070
Reya Montoya?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.105
Chris, Street,

15:38.138 --> 15:39.272
shut her down.
Hey!

15:41.141 --> 15:43.110
Hey, get out of there!

15:43.143 --> 15:44.511
Cut the engine!
CHRIS:
Show us your hands!

15:47.380 --> 15:48.348
Get out of the vehicle!

15:51.284 --> 15:53.653
I got nothing to do with
whatever it is she did.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.122
Oh, no, you're just playing
doctor off the books

15:55.155 --> 15:56.556
and without a license.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.125
Don't worry,
we're not here for you.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.462
We're the good guys,
you should be thanking us.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.563
For what?
For finding you

16:03.596 --> 16:04.998
before the cartel did.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.634
Get her out of here.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.474
Deac.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.143
How'd your C.I. work out?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.311
Uh, he said the word's out
somebody hit a casita.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.579
Big bounty for anyone involved.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.281
I was afraid of that.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.016
Any new info on which
cartel was moving the gold?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.018
No, and he's gonna text me
if he hears anything.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.020
We got our fichera girl, Reya.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.022
Maybe she can I.D. Diego
before this gets violent.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.190
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.092
CHRIS:
Bad news?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.594
I can't find this Nerf Nitro toy
my kid wants for Christmas.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.063
Mm.
And I had a lead

16:36.096 --> 16:36.963
on what's apparently
the last one

16:36.996 --> 16:38.498
in the city,
and it just fell through.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.167
Oh, that sounds bad,
and I hate to make it worse,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.435
but tag!

16:42.469 --> 16:45.305
You got a few, uh,
open keepers right there.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.577
SWAT has standards, yo.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.713
Game on.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.282
Wow.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.117
HONDO: Witnesses saw you
with Joaquin and Diego

16:57.150 --> 16:59.586
before the robbery.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.753
Serving drinks.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.122
That's my job.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.356
Job's not exactly legal.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.691
And why'd you disappear
after the shootings?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.493
My arm, I was hurt.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.628
Why not go to the hospital?
You don't understand.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.497
I understand the text
messages on your phone.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.199
It's you
promising someone

17:12.232 --> 17:13.266
you'll return their gold,

17:13.300 --> 17:15.502
so who were you talking to?

17:15.535 --> 17:18.271
I think you were in
on the casita robbery.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.273
Eyes and ears
for Diego and Joaquin,

17:20.307 --> 17:22.175
but once they got their
hands on the gold,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.310
they tried to cut you out.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.247
Reya, one of them is dead,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.082
the other one's
on the run,

17:29.116 --> 17:31.418
so that only leaves
you to put in prison.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.286
Unless you've got
a bigger cartel fish to give us.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.587
I can't talk to you.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.366
You see her bracelet?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.336
Yeah. Could just be
a piece of jewelry.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.542
All right,
time's up, Reya.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.746
I'm gonna have to go talk to
the D.A. about filing charges.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.788
I apologize.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.690
He can be a bit of a hothead.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.428
Noticed your bracelet.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.629
Our Lady of Guadalupe.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.797
You Catholic?

18:17.830 --> 18:20.567
No, it's... it's nothing.

18:20.600 --> 18:25.405
When I was a kid, I used to...
I used to hate going to Mass.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.640
All the kneeling
and the praying.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.511
I couldn't wait to get older so
I wouldn't have to go anymore.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.415
But now I'm grown up, and...

18:35.448 --> 18:36.549
I still go.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.151
I take my kids.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.686
I want them to learn about

18:39.719 --> 18:43.323
kindness and tolerance
and forgiveness.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.794
My mom took me to Mass.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.397
I haven't been since she died.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.165
Well, that doesn't sound
like the upbringing

18:52.199 --> 18:55.468
of a girl working at a casita,
selling drugs and booze.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.837
Fichera girl was never the goal.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.374
I went to college.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.175
I got a degree.

19:02.209 --> 19:06.713
I moved to L.A.
with a good plan.

19:06.746 --> 19:11.284
But I trusted the wrong people,
and it messed up my life.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.953
I think there's more to you
than you're letting on.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.723
I think your mother raised you
to do the right thing.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.725
I've tried
to do the right thing.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.760
And it never works out for me.

19:21.628 --> 19:25.598
Yeah, well, just because
you have good intentions

19:25.632 --> 19:29.702
does not mean you get rewarded.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.638
Not yet, anyway.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.875
It's when you do good
without the reward.

19:35.908 --> 19:39.212
That's when you find grace.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.984
Does lying to the cartel count?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.886
What do you mean?

19:46.919 --> 19:49.589
They texted me
that they knew I was involved.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.758
So I told them I have the gold,

19:51.791 --> 19:54.427
to buy time, to keep them from
killing me until I could find

19:54.461 --> 19:56.463
a safe way to get out of town.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.765
They keep texting me,
threatening me.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.267
DEACON:
SWAT can protect you.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.968
We can take down
the cartel if we find Diego

20:02.001 --> 20:04.437
and the rest of the gold.
I just need his last name

20:04.471 --> 20:05.805
or-or where he lives.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.777
Diego Pasqual.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.946
He was a casita regular.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.015
Thank you, Reya.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.684
You did the right thing.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.468
CHRIS:
LAPD SWAT, policía!

20:40.473 --> 20:41.741
Clear!

20:47.447 --> 20:48.748
Breach, Luca, now!

20:48.781 --> 20:50.550
Come on, sweetie,
who's a boss

21:04.464 --> 21:07.300
Give me two, give me two!
Two, two, two!

21:07.334 --> 21:08.835
Right side's clear!
Left side clear!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.703
All clear! Two!
Chris out!

21:10.737 --> 21:12.505
Luca out!
Street out!

21:33.593 --> 21:35.695
Deac! Deacon's down.
Deacon's down!

21:37.497 --> 21:39.432
Hondo, move!
Street!

21:45.071 --> 21:47.474
That's Diego.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.542
Deac.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.512
How is he?
Alive and kicking.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.013
CHRIS: Deac, stay down.
Deac, take it easy.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.482
Get your breath back.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.350
You just took two slugs
to the vest.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.751
Tan, call Command.
Tell them we need a medic.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.019
No, no paramedics.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.053
I just got the wind
knocked out of me.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.355
Hondo...

22:02.389 --> 22:03.356
got a present for you.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.394
Rest of the cartel gold.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.800
Hey, you think Beyoncé will
take a selfie with me?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.503
I don't get it.
You're not a single lady

22:16.536 --> 22:18.905
who wants to put a ring on it.
What's your obsession with...

22:18.938 --> 22:21.508
Queen Bey-- her songs
speak to me.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.842
Chris, is that an unclipped
buckle on your vest?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.110
Oh, come on, we just
took down a door.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.813
No excuse for sloppy.
Hand it over.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.651
Maybe you can arm-wrestle
Luca for his.
Mm.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.719
You good?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.421
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.456
I just gotta make a call
about that toy for Matthew.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.924
Okay.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.063
Hey. Hey, honey, just...

22:44.096 --> 22:46.466
just checking in.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.667
How's it going there?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.068
Uh, fine.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.437
Are you on your way home?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.772
DEACON:
No, not yet, uh, just, uh,

22:52.805 --> 22:56.075
just wanted to hear your voice.

22:56.108 --> 23:01.013
Um, I'm still searching
for that toy for Matthew.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.450
But, uh, I gotta go.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.087
I love you, Annie.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.123
I love you, too.
See you soon, I hope.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.596
How you feeling, man?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.865
I'm, uh, good.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.000
Probably get away
with a couple bruises.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.071
Annie's gonna whup my ass
when she sees it.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.773
Annie stopped worrying

23:26.806 --> 23:28.908
about my bruises years ago.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.481
Hey...

23:34.514 --> 23:36.983
I smelled the fresh paint.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.585
I thought it might be
a false wall,

23:38.618 --> 23:39.586
I should have
pulled the team out

23:39.619 --> 23:41.153
and sent the robot in.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.757
When I saw you go down...
I would have made the same call.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.059
It's all good.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.835
Who you got there, Mumford?

23:57.937 --> 24:01.741
Enrique Flores. "Little E"
to his homies in the Diablos.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.876
Your gang worked the casita
that got hit?

24:03.910 --> 24:06.746
Yeah. But we didn't
have nothing to do

24:06.779 --> 24:08.014
with the place getting jacked.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.048
Who's the missing gold
belong to?

24:09.081 --> 24:10.483
Think you're talking
to a snitch?

24:10.517 --> 24:11.918
No. No, I think I'm talking

24:11.951 --> 24:13.720
to the guy in charge
of security for that casita.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.988
Which means, sooner or later,
you're going to catch the blame.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.625
So why don't you just let us
clean up this mess

24:18.658 --> 24:20.226
before you get caught up in it?

24:22.829 --> 24:26.032
It's El Malo's gold.
And he wants it back.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.034
Rocker, give Mr. Flores
a tour

24:28.067 --> 24:29.502
of our fine facilities.

24:29.536 --> 24:30.603
He's got some
outstanding warrants.

24:30.637 --> 24:34.073
Let's go, Little E.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.775
El Malo's dangerous.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.044
He doesn't usually stick
his head above ground.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.179
No, he's too busy ordering
executions here and in Mexico.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.648
CHRIS:
Hondo,

24:41.681 --> 24:42.949
a video text message
just came in

24:42.982 --> 24:44.584
on Reya's phone.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.154
LUPE :
Reya,

24:48.187 --> 24:50.189
they want their gold back.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.625
If you don't give it to them,

24:52.659 --> 24:55.027
they're gonna kill me
at midnight.

24:55.061 --> 24:59.766
Reya, please, you're my friend.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.234
HONDO:
El Malo is ruthless.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.070
Reya's friend is dead
unless he gets his gold back.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.738
What if we use
this Reya as bait

25:05.772 --> 25:07.106
for a sting operation?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.275
Reya's a civilian.
The op could go bad.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.611
Let's remember, we almost lost
Street when he went undercover.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.179
I understand,
but we learned from that.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.581
It won't happen again.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.549
Plus, it's a chance
at a cartel boss

25:16.583 --> 25:18.718
wanted in two countries.
MUMFORD: Deacon has a point.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.687
Without a chance to really
plan this thing out

25:20.720 --> 25:22.555
and nail down the details,
we could end up

25:22.589 --> 25:24.891
with two dead civilians and
the department getting asked

25:24.924 --> 25:26.125
a lot of tough questions.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.128
Hmm. Well.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.564
Well, I'm not clear on all
the details of the case.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.833
Jessica, you've been
on it from the start,

25:33.866 --> 25:35.635
so I'm gonna leave
the call to you.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.306
Well, that's a profile
in courage right there.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.578
Okay, we cannot leave
a young woman to die.

25:45.612 --> 25:49.015
The best way to save her and get
to El Malo is to use Reya.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.652
Can we keep her safe?
We'll have to.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.221
Any doubts, share them now.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.989
We'll get it done.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.326
I'm calling it, then.
We do it.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.128
I just got a question.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.765
Is Reya up to it?

26:08.635 --> 26:11.604
DEACON: We are going to try
and rescue your friend

26:11.638 --> 26:13.372
and capture El Malo,
but there are risks.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.074
And we need your help
to make it work.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.310
You want me to do
the right thing, to trust you.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.380
People have lied
to me before.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.082
Well, I'm not.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.384
I've been shot,
I've faced death.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.287
Life requires trust.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.823
His people will find me.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.625
You'll get witness
protection.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.393
No one will ever find you.

26:34.426 --> 26:38.765
You can start a new life away
from cartels and casitas.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.900
Maybe go back to that
original plan of yours?

26:42.802 --> 26:45.705
If you say no,
you can walk out of here.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.373
And I promise,
we will spread the word

26:47.406 --> 26:49.175
that you don't have
El Malo's gold.

26:51.944 --> 26:56.883
If I say yes...
you'll protect me?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.653
With my life.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.264
Michael.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.934
I-I didn't expect you
back so soon.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.804
Please don't tell me you're here
for another ride-along.

27:17.837 --> 27:18.671
Don't tempt me.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.772
Wearing that vest
was almost enough

27:19.806 --> 27:21.874
to make a couch potato like
me feel like a real man.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.210
I hear your board meetings
can get pretty heated.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.946
I'm usually able
to defend myself there

27:26.979 --> 27:28.147
with just a witty remark.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.349
Actually, I came
to see you.

27:30.382 --> 27:31.884
I scanned through
your proposals.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.886
Thanks. I know you have
a reputation

27:33.920 --> 27:35.354
for being open to new ideas.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.724
These are big.
Frankly, some are just

27:37.757 --> 27:39.025
way too expensive
to implement.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.192
At least in the near future.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.028
Not if we apply
for federal grants.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.362
It's not just the money.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.931
Some are unrealistic in scope.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.799
But the police
accountability

27:46.833 --> 27:49.869
and anti-bias
training programs,

27:49.902 --> 27:52.438
those two could really
work-- I was impressed.

27:52.471 --> 27:55.241
Thank you.
Won't make a lot
of cops happy.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.710
The good ones won't mind,
and that's most of them.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.345
Have you worked
the budget numbers?

27:59.378 --> 28:01.413
We can start small
and scale up.
Jessica, to be honest,

28:01.447 --> 28:02.882
the proposals have to be
completely rewritten

28:02.915 --> 28:03.916
if you want the
board's approval.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.118
The ideas are there,

28:06.152 --> 28:07.887
but they have to be presented
in a way to attract
majority support.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.255
Right now they're not.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.990
I can have new proposals
ready in a few weeks.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.291
That's a lot of extra work.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.026
As a SWAT captain,
I know you're busy.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.395
I can do both.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.365
One question.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.301
What's behind
all this ambition?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.876
I wasn't born in this country.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.813
My parents sacrificed
to give me more.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.148
I want to pay them
and this city back.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.886
When I was young, I worked
construction with my dad.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.988
Laying tile and concrete.

28:42.021 --> 28:45.157
I know what it's like to want
more, to prove yourself.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.259
This isn't about me, though.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.429
I believe these projects could
make a real difference.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.164
Help people.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.234
That's why I joined
the police commission.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.537
I think you're going
to need my help, though,

28:58.570 --> 29:00.139
to get these approved.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.041
It's not going to be easy.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.410
I'm ready to do the work.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.847
Good.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.318
Thank you.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.353
Don't thank me yet.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.196
The kidnappers answered
our text, agreed to the meet.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.965
Hopefully, El Malo turns up
with Lupe.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.333
The deal is Reya
gives him the gold,

29:27.366 --> 29:28.801
and both women walk away.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.369
Kidnappers think they're
just talking to Reya.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.071
Operation's a go in 30 minutes.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.472
Chapel at Rosedale Cemetery.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.074
Cemetery's over 60 acres.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.810
The chapel is here,
near South Catalina Street.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.246
We'll cover all entrances
and exits.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.982
Aerial surveillance will clock
any movement on the ground.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.817
We've got no time to advance-
scout the meet sites,

29:44.851 --> 29:46.953
so we're going in blind--
stay sharp.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.221
Camera ready?
Just have to put it on.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.090
Bait car?
Gassed up, ready to go.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.825
Eyes in the sky?
Ready for takeoff.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.193
Decoy gold bars?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.527
Only way to tell
the difference

29:55.561 --> 29:56.829
is with ultrasound.
We're ready.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.797
Let's go set a trap.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.382
Hey, Techno Boy.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.217
Socks are regulation black,
yours are blue.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.491
Watch your back.
Game's not over.

30:32.899 --> 30:36.368
The button cam's so small.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.871
Hey, we're going to see
and hear everything you do.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.139
So if there's
anything dangerous,

30:40.172 --> 30:41.307
we move in and get you out.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.376
Now, how's the Kevlar
vest feel?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.545
Mm, it's weird.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.548
You're not gonna need it, but
it's good to know it's there.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.954
Remember, there'll be an
unmarked car right behind you.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.089
So we will have eyes
on you at all times.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.591
I'm scared.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.561
Yeah, I know the feeling.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.067
Do you know what I do
when I get scared?

31:08.100 --> 31:10.669
I put my faith in the plan

31:10.702 --> 31:12.638
and in my teammates.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.275
Can we say a prayer?

31:16.308 --> 31:18.577
Yeah, of course
we can, Reya.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.413
No, it's...

31:21.447 --> 31:23.415
it's Mireya.

31:23.449 --> 31:27.053
My mother chose it
because it means "miracle."

31:32.324 --> 31:34.026
Our Father...

31:34.060 --> 31:36.095
BOTH:
Who art in Heaven,

31:36.128 --> 31:38.097
hallowed be Thy name.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.699
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

31:40.732 --> 31:44.003
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.572
as we forgive those who
trespass against us,

31:46.605 --> 31:48.640
and lead us not
into temptation,

31:48.674 --> 31:51.010
but deliver us
from evil.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.678
For the kingdom, the
power, and the glory

31:52.711 --> 31:54.913
are yours for ever
and ever.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.051
:
Amen.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.086
Amen.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.054
Amen.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.533
*

32:37.323 --> 32:40.526
DEACON:
30-David. I have visual.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.694
No sign of El Malo
or the hostage.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.065
22-David.
Perimeter roads are clear.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.433
20-David. Eyes on our friendly.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.668
No eyes inside.
No way of knowing

32:49.701 --> 32:51.570
if El Malo got here early
and is hiding.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.305
Anything from the drone?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.274
We're coming
into range now.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.409
I got heat signatures
in the chapel.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.577
Could be El Malo
and his men.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.449
We got movement.
Roger that.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.684
DEACON:
Two hostiles with our friendly.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.053
Meet in progress.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.423
They're heading
inside the chapel

33:11.457 --> 33:13.159
No shot if they go inside.
Am I green to go?

33:13.192 --> 33:14.326
Not yet.
Only if our friendly

33:14.360 --> 33:15.561
is in danger, Deac.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.201
Roger that.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.472
20-David to Command.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.707
Any eyes inside?
Copy that. We have eyes.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.209
TAN:
Two male suspects
and the hostage.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.378
I got audio.
They're talking about the gold.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.213
Where's El Malo?
Nothing yet, but stay alert.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.783
Reya just told them
the gold's in the trunk

33:37.816 --> 33:39.251
of the car--
I think they bought it.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.153
We got six heat signatures
in the chapel.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.155
They're on the move, heading
for the chapel doors.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.257
Six? We only have three people
on Reya's button cam.

33:45.291 --> 33:45.957
Who are the other two?

33:47.426 --> 33:49.561
HONDO:
Does anyone see El Malo?

33:49.595 --> 33:53.099
DEACON:
Still no sign of El Malo,
but I have our two hostiles

33:53.132 --> 33:54.333
with our two friendlies.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.534
They're heading
for the bait car.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.590
Suspects down.

34:18.624 --> 34:19.725
CHRIS:
Get out! Get out!

34:19.758 --> 34:21.860
Get out!
Get out!

34:24.896 --> 34:27.499
OFFICER:
I got our two friendlies.
They're safe.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.535
He's not here, boss.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.503
El Malo get past us?

34:31.537 --> 34:32.738
Not with cameras and drones.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.639
*

34:37.643 --> 34:39.645
20-David to Command.
What's the location

34:39.678 --> 34:41.680
of those unknown
heat signatures?

34:41.713 --> 34:43.649
Two still moving, heading east
away from the chapel

34:43.849 --> 34:44.783
toward the crematory.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.823
He's underneath us,

34:51.857 --> 34:53.825
in the service tunnel
for the cemetery.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.127
Fan out.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.136
HONDO:
Check the blueprints.

35:04.170 --> 35:06.505
I need to know where the service
tunnel for the chapel ends.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.510
Hondo, you're parallel
to the two targets.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.612
Got the tunnel-- it ends
at Palm Tree Circle.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.813
Roger that.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.616
Approaching now.
Alert the team.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.220
HONDO:
Police!

35:31.630 --> 35:33.599
Stop moving! It's over!

35:37.436 --> 35:38.404
Get up!

35:38.437 --> 35:39.705
Get up!

35:41.440 --> 35:42.941
We're good?
We're good.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.176
Let's go.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.226
Good job.
HONDO:
We got a few

36:00.259 --> 36:02.228
of his guys, too.
All in all, not the worst way

36:02.261 --> 36:03.562
to spend a night in a cemetery.

36:03.595 --> 36:04.863
Definitely not.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.465
Sergeant!

36:12.238 --> 36:13.905
Thanks so much.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.274
My pleasure.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.443
Hey, good luck
with your new life.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.744
God loves you.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.380
Even with all my mistakes?

36:21.413 --> 36:23.582
Forgiveness starts with
forgiving yourself.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.353
I'll be praying for you.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.400
This case is closed.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.604
All right, so talk
to me, talk to me.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.306
What happened?

36:47.339 --> 36:48.740
Who got the golden tickets?

36:48.774 --> 36:51.277
Mwah! Beyoncé,
here I come!

36:51.310 --> 36:53.745
I got the golden ticket.
I'm going to New York.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.481
HONDO: Okay, okay.
Well, I'm not gonna lie. Street,

36:55.514 --> 36:57.883
I really thought you
were gonna pull from
behind on this one.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.017
:
Yeah.
Well, it looks like

36:59.050 --> 37:01.353
our winners are Luca and Chris.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.555
Enjoy the Grammys.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.756
Deac, what happened,
man? I just knew

37:04.790 --> 37:06.558
you were gonna put up
more of a fight.

37:06.592 --> 37:07.559
Aw, head's not
in the game.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.860
We got less than ten hours

37:08.894 --> 37:10.429
until Christmas morning
to find that toy,

37:10.462 --> 37:12.331
and my last lead
just went bust.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.566
Well, it is the season
of miracles, right?

37:14.600 --> 37:16.568
Well, listen up, I know
it's the holidays,

37:16.602 --> 37:19.638
but before you get out of here,
I just want to say something.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.740
I'm really proud of each
and every one of you.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.875
It's been a
hell of a year.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.612
And this team...

37:26.645 --> 37:28.614
It did take a
little time, though.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.949
But we worked it out.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.984
If we stick together,

37:33.018 --> 37:34.286
you know what
the reward is?

37:34.320 --> 37:35.687
One kick-ass SWAT family.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.889
You know it, boss!
Get out of here.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.291
Go have some fun.
You earned it. Go.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.427
All right.
Thanks, boss.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.429
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
One last thing.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.030
One last thing.
Almost forgot.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.433
You might find a
little something by your
lockers, I'm just saying.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.335
Happy holidays.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.269
LUCA:
All right, night, boss.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.474
*

37:55.507 --> 37:57.576
Oh, my God,
Christmas stockings.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.445
What?
Whoa!

37:59.478 --> 38:00.979
Oh!

38:01.012 --> 38:02.981
Yeah! Driving glasses!

38:03.014 --> 38:04.983
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

38:05.016 --> 38:07.753
Got to look sharp
when I'm wheeling Black Betty.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.588
Think he put a lump
of coal in mine?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.590
LUCA:
Aw, man, Team Challenge Coin.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.392
You got to really step up
to earn one of those.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.593
Can't wait to try these
in the ring.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.627
Lakers-Celtics!

38:15.661 --> 38:17.596
Oh! Sweet!
Is that the toy

38:17.629 --> 38:18.664
your kid wanted?

38:18.697 --> 38:19.898
Yeah.
STREET:
I thought you said

38:19.931 --> 38:21.867
they were sold out.
They were. They are.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.337
How'd he find one
on Christmas Eve?

38:25.371 --> 38:28.006
"It pays to have high
friends in low places.

38:28.039 --> 38:32.010
"Luckily, I had a favor
to cash in with the
toy king of Compton.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.746
Merry Christmas. Hondo."

38:34.780 --> 38:35.981
That's righteous.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.583
Your little man's
gonna love that.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.884
Yeah.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.786
("White Christmas"
by Otis Redding playing)

38:40.819 --> 38:44.390
* Little bitty, little bitty,
little bitty children... *

38:44.423 --> 38:46.858
Commissioner.
You got a minute?

38:46.892 --> 38:49.060
Don't forget the
bulletproof vest.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.868
Huh. Looks like you
took away Hick's favorite toy.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.904
How'd you manage that?

38:58.937 --> 39:01.440
Michael read my proposals
for police accountability

39:01.473 --> 39:02.741
and anti-bias training.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.543
He wants to help me
implement them.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.644
Jess, that's amazing.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.679
No stopping you now, huh?

39:08.947 --> 39:10.649
How does Hicks feel
about it?

39:10.682 --> 39:11.783
I'm not sure.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.084
Haven't told him yet.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.953
Be careful.
Always am.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.722
We on for later?

39:16.755 --> 39:17.989
Be there with bells on.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.959
Forget the bells;
bring the mistletoe.

39:23.762 --> 39:27.032
Heard you closed
that cartel case.

39:27.065 --> 39:30.436
Congratulations on catching
their ringleader.

39:30.469 --> 39:33.004
El Malo's gonna love
American prison.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.741
And the world's gonna be a
better place having him there.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.445
Speaking of leaders,
how's Captain Cortez as a boss?

39:40.479 --> 39:41.847
She's great.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.516
She cares about her
officers and civilians.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.418
She's impressive.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.086
Her ideas could
really help this city.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.455
HONDO:
She's definitely motivated.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.722
She's got a lot of heart.

39:50.756 --> 39:51.890
I agree.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.659
I think she's destined

39:53.692 --> 39:55.961
for bigger things
than just SWAT.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.598
Congratulations again,
Sergeant Harrelson.

39:59.631 --> 40:03.769
* And may all
of your Christmases *

40:03.802 --> 40:06.137
* Baby, may your days

40:06.171 --> 40:07.873
* May your days

40:07.906 --> 40:10.108
* Be merry

40:10.141 --> 40:11.209
* Merry

40:11.242 --> 40:13.545
* So merry and bright

40:13.579 --> 40:17.883
* Lord, have mercy,
I wish all of 'em, honey *

40:20.018 --> 40:21.487
* And may all

40:23.489 --> 40:25.423
* Your Christmases

40:27.225 --> 40:29.995

40:38.003 --> 40:41.106

40:49.948 --> 40:52.918
* Yeah, lovely
white Christmas *

40:52.951 --> 40:55.086

the one with... *
