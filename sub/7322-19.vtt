WEBVTT

00:02.473 --> 00:06.006
(Two Door Cinema Club's
"You're Not Stubborn" playing)

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
(Meredith)
PSYCHOLOGISTS BELIEVE

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
THAT EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.413
ALL OUR THOUGHT PROCESSES
AND BEHAVIOR PATTERNS,

00:12.413 --> 00:14.115
ARE THE DIRECT RESULT

00:14.115 --> 00:16.117
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO OUR PARENTS...

00:16.117 --> 00:18.018
WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING
ALL THOUGHTFUL.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.051
♪ NOW CAN WE GET ALONG? ♪

00:20.051 --> 00:23.124
I WAS JUST THINKING
HOW PRETTY YOU ARE...

00:23.124 --> 00:26.227
AND ALSO HOW PRETTY
OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.199
CHILDREN?

00:28.199 --> 00:30.301
LIKE, MULTIPLE?

00:30.301 --> 00:32.032
CHILD.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.435
LET'S JUST START WITH ONE
AND SEE HOW THAT GOES.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.537
YOU WANNA START?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.769
I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU'RE PRETTY.

00:38.769 --> 00:40.771
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:40.771 --> 00:43.174
THAT EVERY RELATIONSHIP
THAT WE HAVE

00:43.174 --> 00:46.777
IS REALLY JUST ANOTHER VERSION
OF THAT FIRST RELATIONSHIP.

00:46.777 --> 00:49.450
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO DR. WYATT?

00:49.450 --> 00:51.222
CRISTINA...

00:51.222 --> 00:54.725
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU...

00:54.725 --> 00:58.259
IT'S JUST US
TRYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN

00:58.259 --> 01:00.761
TO GET IT RIGHT.
(knock on door)

01:00.761 --> 01:02.263
(water running)
ALEX.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.265
MER?
OKAY, SO IZZIE'S NOT HERE,

01:04.265 --> 01:06.267
AND CRISTINA'S
NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE,

01:06.267 --> 01:07.768
AND I HAVE A THING.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.271
SO I NEED YOU
TO BE A GIRL FOR ME.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.374
WHAT'D HE DO?
YOU WANT ME TO KICK HIS ASS?
HE WANTS ME TO HAVE A BABY.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.706
SO YOU DO WANT ME
TO KICK HIS ASS.

01:15.706 --> 01:18.549
ALEX.
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
A BABY?

01:18.549 --> 01:22.313
A BABY DOESN'T WANT ME. I HAD
THE WORST MOTHER IN THE WORLD.

01:22.313 --> 01:25.256
I WOULD BE THE WORST MOTHER
IN THE WORLD.

01:25.256 --> 01:28.289
IZZIE WANTS A DIVORCE.
(sighs) SHE SENT THE PAPERS--

01:28.289 --> 01:31.722
THE OFFICIAL PAPERS.
WANT ME TO KICK HER ASS?

01:31.722 --> 01:33.093
(knock on door)

01:33.093 --> 01:35.626
HEY, ALEX. HEY.

01:35.626 --> 01:38.529
HE'S BEING A GIRL FOR ME.
DUDE, IT'S TRUE.

01:38.529 --> 01:39.870
RIGHT.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.603
WELL, THERE'S A GUY DOWNSTAIRS
SAYS HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.436
YOU WANT ME TO SEND HIM UP HERE
TO THE BATHROOM

01:45.436 --> 01:48.309
SINCE THIS SEEMS TO BE WHERE
YOU RECEIVE YOUR VISITORS?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.142
UH, TELL HIM TO WAIT.
RIGHT.

01:51.142 --> 01:52.883
YOU HAVE A BROTHER?

01:52.883 --> 01:55.786
YEAH.
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
GET RID OF HIM?

01:55.786 --> 01:58.749
CRAP.
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

01:58.749 --> 02:01.252
ALEX IS THE OLDEST,
THEN ME AND THEN AMBER.

02:01.252 --> 02:03.394
AMBER'S GRADUATING FROM
ST. SAVIOR'S IN MAY.

02:03.394 --> 02:05.896
SHE'S... SHE'S SMART,
LIKE ALEX.

02:05.896 --> 02:08.229
SHE COULD GO TO COLLEGE
IF SHE WANTED TO,

02:08.229 --> 02:10.231
BUT SHE'S LIKE,
"WHAT'S THE POINT?" YOU KNOW?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.233
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL HER.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.134
ALEX IS THE DOCTOR
IN THE FAMILY.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.867
I JUST MOVE PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.
(chuckles) HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:16.867 --> 02:19.170
MAN. YOU GOT OLD.
(laughs) HEY.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.141
DUDE, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.143
I HAD TO DRIVE TO PORTLAND
ON A JOB,

02:23.143 --> 02:26.477
AND SINCE I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD...
WELL, PORTLAND'S NOT
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:26.477 --> 02:29.180
IT'S THREE HOURS.
I DO THREE HOURS IN MY SLEEP.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.682
ALEX, HE'S YOUR BROTHER.
HE'S ALLOWED TO COME SAY HI.

02:31.682 --> 02:34.455
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR PRE-ROUNDS.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.328
OKAY. WELL, IT--IT WAS
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:37.328 --> 02:38.889
I'M LEXIE, BY THE WAY.

02:38.889 --> 02:42.663
I'M OVERDUE FOR A VISIT.
IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS.
NO, IT HAS NOT.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.197
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HOME.
SEVEN YEARS.

02:46.197 --> 02:49.540
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HOME
IN SEVEN YEARS?
DEREK. I HAVE THIS.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.642
MM-HMM. HEY, I'M DEREK.
NICE MEETING YOU.

02:51.642 --> 02:52.803
AARON.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.375
TAKE CARE.
I'LL SEE YOU.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.176
MEREDITH, BY THE WAY.
HELLO.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.209
NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:58.209 --> 03:00.211
HAS IT BEEN SEVEN YEARS?

03:00.211 --> 03:02.883
AMBER WAS 10
THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.556
AARON, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:05.556 --> 03:08.559
I DO MISS YOU, OKAY?
AND I-I DID WANT TO SAY HI,

03:08.559 --> 03:11.762
BUT SINCE YOU'RE A DOCTOR,
I THOUGHT I'D ASK...

03:13.864 --> 03:16.597
SHOULD I BE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS?

03:25.876 --> 03:27.878
(espresso machine whirs,
cash register dings)
(woman) THANK YOU.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.380
CAPPUCCINO.
CAPPUCCINO.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.382
SO... HOW'D THE DATE GO
WITH TEDDY?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.384
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL IT A DATE.

03:33.384 --> 03:36.387
DOESN'T GOING ON A DATE IMPLY
ACTUALLY GOING SOMEWHERE?

03:36.387 --> 03:39.320
(chuckles) OH, SHUT UP.
YOU HAD SEX?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.322
HEY, GUYS.
HEY. (chuckles)

03:41.322 --> 03:42.893
(chuckles)

03:44.795 --> 03:46.297
(elevator bell dings)

03:46.297 --> 03:48.299
OH! POUND CAKE.
(chuckles)

03:48.299 --> 03:50.631
I LOVE POUND CAKE...
(cash register beeps
and dings)

03:50.631 --> 03:52.763
(woman) THANK YOU.
RICH, BUTTERY POUND CAKE.

03:52.763 --> 03:55.806
MM.
YUM. POUND CAKE. (laughs)

03:55.806 --> 03:57.237
MMM.
MM.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.270
MM-HMM.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.741
(elevator bell dings)

04:00.741 --> 04:02.673
POUND CAKE?
OH, I'M GOOD. THANKS.

04:02.673 --> 04:04.244
MM. (chuckles)

04:04.244 --> 04:06.477
SO WHAT EXACTLY CONSTITUTES
A POUND CAKE?

04:06.477 --> 04:09.820
IT'S A YELLOW CAKE...
(woman) THERE YOU GO.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.622
KINDA HEAVY.

04:11.622 --> 04:13.854
COME ON. CODE FOR
SOMETHING DIRTY, RIGHT?

04:13.854 --> 04:16.857
LIKE "YOU EAT HER POUND CAKE.
SHE EATS YOUR POUND CAKE"?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.389
(elevator bell dings)
NO.

04:18.389 --> 04:20.391
OH, PLEASE,
TELL ME IT'S DIRTY,

04:20.391 --> 04:22.893
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, THAT WAS
THE MOST BORING CONVERSATION

04:22.893 --> 04:25.396
I'VE EVER BEEN A PART OF.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
POUND CAKE

04:25.396 --> 04:27.398
BECAUSE I WANT A KID,
AND SHE DOESN'T,

04:27.398 --> 04:29.400
AND WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.403
HOW LONG ARE YOU TWO NOT
GONNA HAVE THAT CONVERSATION--

04:32.403 --> 04:35.005
A YEAR, TWO YEARS, FIVE?

04:35.005 --> 04:38.509
WOW. SO... YOU AND TEDDY
ATE POUND CAKE TOGETHER.

04:38.509 --> 04:40.911
YOU'RE CHANGING THE SUBJECT.
(laughs) YOU LIKE
HOW I DID THAT?

04:40.911 --> 04:43.554
SO HOW WAS IT?

04:43.554 --> 04:45.285
MIND-BLOWING.
YEAH?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.287
I POUNDED HER CAKE.
SHE POUNDED MINE.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.789
(laughs) GOOD.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.290
EXCELLENT POUND CAKING.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.292
"POUND CAKING"
IS NOT A THING.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.365
(chuckles)
WHATEVER. I BLEW HER MIND.
(laughs)

04:54.365 --> 04:55.996
LIFE-CHANGING?
LIFE-CHANGING,
EARTH-SHATTERING.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.469
THE POINT IS, HE'S A LEGEND
FOR A REASON.

04:58.469 --> 05:01.001
I MEAN, HE HAS SKILLS THAT
I NEVER EVEN KNEW EXISTED.

05:01.001 --> 05:05.035
IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS
A-A PARTY GOING ON.
A PARTY IN YOUR PANTIES.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.077
OH. (laughs)
(laughs)

05:07.077 --> 05:09.309
(elevator bell dings)
MORNING.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.911
GOOD MORNING.
HI.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.584
(button clicks)

05:13.584 --> 05:15.886
(sighs)

05:15.886 --> 05:18.088
(motor whirring)

05:18.088 --> 05:21.552
(floor indicator bell dings)
OKAY, BYE.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.924
BYE.
SEE YA.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.628
(laughs)
HE'S ALWAYS SO GRUMPY.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.001
HE'S GOING THROUGH SOMETHING,
AND CRISTINA DOESN'T GET IT.

05:31.001 --> 05:33.003
SHE CAN'T,
WHICH ISN'T HER FAULT,

05:33.003 --> 05:36.467
BUT I DO GET IT, AND... AND I
CAN'T BE THERE FOR HIM,

05:36.467 --> 05:38.108
AND THAT'S...

05:38.108 --> 05:40.010
THAT'S REALLY HARD.

05:40.010 --> 05:43.914
BUT YOU'RE SEEING MARK.

05:43.914 --> 05:45.876
BUT I'M SEEING MARK.

05:47.618 --> 05:50.581
SO THEN A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
WE'RE AT THE GROCERY STORE,

05:50.581 --> 05:52.953
GARY AND I,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

05:52.953 --> 05:55.926
I'M FLAT ON MY BACK
IN THE FROZEN FOODS SECTION.

05:55.926 --> 05:57.988
SHE FAINTED.
AND I'VE NEVER FAINTED.

05:57.988 --> 06:01.792
I NEVER SEEN ANYBODY FAINT.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN FAINTING.
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD?

06:01.792 --> 06:04.795
I WOULD'VE IF THIS ONE
HADN'T CAUGHT ME. (laughs)

06:04.795 --> 06:06.967
MRS. CLARK IS ANEMIC
AND GUAIAC POSITIVE,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.800
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME INTERNAL BLEEDING,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.473
WHICH LOOKS LIKE
IT'S COMING FROM A--
FRIABLE TUMOR
NEAR THE AMPULLA OF VATER.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.145
YES, THANK YOU FOR THAT,
DR. KEPNER.
(Gary) DR. SWENDER TOLD US

06:15.145 --> 06:17.377
THE BIOPSY SHOWED
THE CANCER WAS BACK.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.110
BUT SHE SAID YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TAKE IT OUT.
THERE'S A CHANCE
I WON'T BE ABLE

06:20.110 --> 06:23.013
TO GO IN
AS DEEPLY AS I'LL NEED TO,

06:23.013 --> 06:25.516
BUT I PROMISE TO DO
EVERYTHING I CAN.

06:25.516 --> 06:27.688
ANYTHING YOU COULD DO.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.990
WE APPRECIATE IT,
DR. WEBBER.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.423
THANK YOU.

06:33.964 --> 06:36.096
THANK YOU.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.933
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK
I NEED SURGERY.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.635
YOU DO.
YOU DO.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.637
IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT
THAT BAD.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.939
YOU HAVE AN UMBILICAL HERNIA.
YOU NEED SURGERY.

06:48.939 --> 06:52.112
SO SHUT UP
AND FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK.
I THINK SURGERY'S JUST
GONNA MAKE IT HURT WORSE.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.645
YOU REMEMBER WHEN DAD HAD
HIS GALL BLADDER OUT?

06:54.645 --> 06:57.548
STOP TALKING AND WRITE.
WRITE WHAT? I DON'T
HAVE INSURANCE. OKAY?

06:57.548 --> 07:00.651
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE?
ASK BAILEY
TO DO IT PRO BONO.

07:00.651 --> 07:03.824
I CAN'T ASK HER TO DO THAT.
ALEX, HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.125
EVILSPAWN HAS A BROTHER?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.827
AH. AARON, CRISTINA YANG.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.930
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, DR. YANG.
I'M AARON KAREV.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.903
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE SO NICE.
HE'S SO NI--

07:12.903 --> 07:15.506
(whispers) BE NICE.
WHY CAN'T YOU BE NICE LIKE
YOUR BROTHER--ANGELSPAWN?

07:15.506 --> 07:18.509
WHY CAN'T YOU?
FAIR ENOUGH.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.011
UH, MER, WHAT'S UP?
YOU CALLED?
(normal voice) TEN TIMES.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.013
OH, WELL... OWEN'S STILL
IN HIS DARK PLACE,

07:23.013 --> 07:25.145
AND HE'S STILL NOT TALKING,
SO I TURNED OFF MY CELL

07:25.145 --> 07:27.818
IN CASE HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING,
WHICH HE DIDN'T.

07:27.818 --> 07:30.981
I HATE MEN. THEY'RE STUPID.
DEREK ASKED ME TO HAVE
A BABY WITH HIM THIS MORNING.

07:30.981 --> 07:33.023
REALLY STUPID.
(pager beeps)

07:33.023 --> 07:36.186
OH! GREAT. THE PIT,
WITH OWEN AND HIS DARK PLACE.

07:36.186 --> 07:39.229
(siren wailing)

07:39.229 --> 07:42.733
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
COP WITH MULTIPLE G.S.W.s.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.735
(Callie) HOW MANY COPS
DID YOU SAY?

07:44.735 --> 07:46.036
JUST ONE.

07:46.036 --> 07:48.238
(siren wails, brakes squeal)

07:48.238 --> 07:51.602
OFFICER GINA THOMPSON, 34,
G.S.W.s TO THE HIP AND CHEST.

07:51.602 --> 07:54.575
VITALS--100 OVER 70,
PULSE 118, RESPIRATION'S 28.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.907
THAT'S QUITE A POLICE ESCORT
THERE, OFFICER THOMPSON.

07:56.907 --> 07:59.079
I TOLD THOSE GUYS
I WAS GONNA BE FINE.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.052
WELL, YEAH. I WONDER
WHY THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.
I BEEN IN WORSE SHAPE.

08:02.052 --> 08:03.854
SERIOUSLY?

08:03.854 --> 08:06.517
(Gina) OH, YEAH.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUYS.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.889
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

08:08.889 --> 08:11.191
YOU TOOK DOWN THREE GUYS
BY YOURSELF?

08:11.191 --> 08:15.095
HEY, A GIRL'S GOTTA DO
WHAT A GIRL'S GOTTA DO.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.127
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?
(man) LET'S GO.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.679
HOW MANY BULLET WOUNDS?
FOUR,
BUT I'M WONDERING IF--

08:28.679 --> 08:31.041
NO EXIT WOUND
FOR THE RIGHT LEG.
PROBABLY BUSTED THE FEMUR.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.644
I HAVE TO GET IN THERE
AND DEBRIDE.
AND TRAJECTORY SEEMS--

08:33.644 --> 08:35.746
(Owen) SEEMS TO
HAVE GONE UPWARDS.
(Cristina) BREATH SOUNDS ARE--

08:35.746 --> 08:38.819
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT, THREE CHEST
WOUNDS CAN'T BE TRANSTHORACIC--
OH, GOD, GINA, BABY.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.722
BABY, LOOK AT YOU.
I'M OKAY, BABY. THEY'RE TAKING
REALLY GOOD CARE OF ME.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.024
THIS IS MY HUSBAND, JIMMY.
THAT'S LIEUTENANT MOORE.

08:44.024 --> 08:48.028
SO WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT
AT THE SCENE?
YOU WERE TOLD TO WAIT
FOR BACKUP.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.931
WELL, I WAS FIRST ON THE SCENE.
I HEARD A SHOT. I WENT IN.
YOU DISOBEYED A DIRECT ORDER.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.934
YOU ENDANGERED YOUR OWN LIFE
AND EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING.
I TOOK DOWN THREE MEN
BY MYSELF.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.306
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF
SUSPENDED FOR IT.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.538
WHAT?!
IT'S GOING TO THE REVIEW BOARD
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.041
YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO HAVE A JOB
BY THE END OF THE DAY.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

09:01.041 --> 09:03.914
NO, I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.
I GOTTA GO DEFEND MYSELF.
(Jackson) I NEED YOU TO TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.

09:03.914 --> 09:07.017
BREATH SOUNDS ARE DECREASING.
SHE'S BLEEDING INTO HER CHEST.
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT,
THROW IN THE CHEST TUBE NOW!

09:07.017 --> 09:09.079
GET THEM OUTTA HERE NOW!
NO, I GOTTA GO. PLEASE!

09:09.079 --> 09:11.121
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT, GINA,
JUST LIE BACK.

09:11.121 --> 09:13.083
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BREATHE.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.926
(Lexie) DR. WEBBER, DID YOU
CONSIDER DOING A WHIPPLE

09:15.926 --> 09:17.227
ON MRS. CLARK?

09:17.227 --> 09:19.229
I DID, BUT SINCE
THE CANCER CAME BACK,

09:19.229 --> 09:21.692
I THINK I CAN DO
A LOCAL RESECTION

09:21.692 --> 09:24.094
AND GET
THE ENTIRE VISIBLE TUMOR.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.136
DR. KEPNER,
ARE WE BORING YOU?

09:26.136 --> 09:29.299
NO, SIR. I JUST--I WASN'T
EXPECTING CHIEF SHEPHERD

09:29.299 --> 09:31.972
TO BE UP IN THE GALLERY
DURING A GENERAL SURGERY.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.574
BUT I GUESS THAT'S
THE CHIEF'S JOB, RIGHT--

09:34.574 --> 09:36.076
EVALUATING, OBSERVING?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.779
DR. KEPNER,
YOU'RE IN MY O.R.,

09:38.779 --> 09:41.211
AND THE ONLY ONE OBSERVING
AND EVALUATING YOU RIGHT NOW

09:41.211 --> 09:43.654
IS ME.

09:43.654 --> 09:45.085
YES, SIR. I'M SORRY, SIR.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.187
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:47.187 --> 09:51.591
(suction gurgling)

09:51.591 --> 09:54.695
(instruments clatter)

09:54.695 --> 09:58.298
(beeping continues)

09:58.298 --> 10:01.371
WITH THE ORANGE
OR THE RED?

10:01.371 --> 10:05.005
HOW'S THAT? ORANGE AND THE RED.
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA WORK?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.007
DR. BAILEY,
YOU GOT A SECOND?

10:07.007 --> 10:09.009
I DO. I HAVE A SECOND.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.141
WHICH IS WHY I'M SPENDING IT
WITH MY CHILD.

10:11.141 --> 10:13.644
HERE, LOOK.
SAY "BYE-BYE, DR. KAREV."

10:13.644 --> 10:15.646
SEE HIM? BYE-BYE.

10:15.646 --> 10:18.248
(speaks indistinctly)

10:18.248 --> 10:19.950
SAY BYE.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.251
DR. BAILEY...

10:21.251 --> 10:23.053
MY LITTLE BROTHER IS HERE,

10:23.053 --> 10:26.156
WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A, UH, UMBILICAL HERNIA.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.659
I DIDN'T KNOW DR. KAREV
HAD A LITTLE BROTHER.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.161
DID YOU KNOW DR. KAREV
HAD A LITTLE BROTHER?

10:31.161 --> 10:33.664
HE HAS NO MONEY. HE DOESN'T
HAVE INSURANCE, SO--

10:33.664 --> 10:35.836
AH, MOMMY SEES
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.039
HE--HE'D HAVE TO HAVE YOU
PERFORM THE SURGERY PRO BONO.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.012
AH! (laughs) DID YOU
HEAR THAT FUNNY WORD?
(laughs)

10:42.012 --> 10:43.313
(laughs) PRO BONO?

10:43.313 --> 10:45.976
MOMMY'S GOT A MOUNTAIN
OF SURGERIES TO SCHEDULE.

10:45.976 --> 10:49.019
DOES SHE HAVE TIME
TO DO FREE SURGERIES?

10:49.019 --> 10:51.321
AND I'LL SCHEDULE
YOUR SURGERIES...
(Tuck speaks indistinctly)

10:51.321 --> 10:54.154
FOR THE NEXT... WEEK
IF YOU WANT.
(laughs)

10:54.154 --> 10:56.326
YOU THINK MOMMY SHOULD FIX UP
DR. KAREV'S BROTHER...

10:56.326 --> 10:59.159
(baby talk voice)
AND MAKE HIM FEEL ALL BETTER?
TWO WEEKS. A MONTH.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
(normal voice)
WELL, ALL RIGHT. (laughs)

11:01.161 --> 11:05.095
I WILL MEET DR. KAREV'S BROTHER
IN, WHAT, HALF AN HOUR.

11:05.095 --> 11:08.899
SAY "BYE-BYE, DR. KAREV."
BYE-BYE. (laughs)

11:08.899 --> 11:10.170
I WOULDA DONE IT ANYWAY,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.803
BUT HE JUST KEPT TALKING,
DIDN'T HE? (laughs)

11:12.803 --> 11:14.174
YOU'RE SO GOOD.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.907
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:16.907 --> 11:19.009
MR. CLARK.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.311
HOW IS SHE?
SHE DID GREAT IN THERE.

11:21.311 --> 11:24.084
SHE WAS A TOTAL TROUPER.
THE SURGERY WENT GREAT.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.857
WE GOT THE TUMOR--ALL OF IT--
WITH GOOD MARGINS.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.859
(laughs)
OH, THANK GOD. OHH.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.221
DR. GREY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:31.221 --> 11:34.224
(exhales deeply)
MY WIFE KEEPS TELLING ME...

11:34.224 --> 11:36.226
I NEED TO BE MORE MANLY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.729
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE CANCER.

11:38.729 --> 11:41.201
SHE'S AFRAID I'M THE ONE
WHO WON'T MAKE IT.
I THINK
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.273
YOU BOTH ARE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HER?

11:43.273 --> 11:46.376
CAN I?
SHE SHOULD BE WAKING UP
ANY MINUTE.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.378
HOW IS IT YOUR BROTHER
IS A SURGEON

11:48.378 --> 11:50.941
AND YOU WAITED MONTHS
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS?

11:50.941 --> 11:53.243
I DON'T KNOW.
KAREVS ARE TOUGH.

11:53.243 --> 11:54.745
OH.

11:54.745 --> 11:56.747
I GUESS FIVE YEARS
IN FOSTER CARE

11:56.747 --> 11:59.249
WILL DO THAT TO YOU.
FOSTER CARE?

11:59.249 --> 12:00.951
YOU'RE ALL FOSTER CHILDREN?

12:00.951 --> 12:02.923
WELL, ME AND AMBER
WERE IN AND OUT,

12:02.923 --> 12:05.195
BUT ALEX, HE HAD LIKE...
(blows air)

12:05.195 --> 12:08.328
17 DIFFERENT FOSTER HOMES
IN 5 YEARS.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.330
SO ALEX WAS A FOSTER CHILD?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.203
YEAH, BECAUSE MY MOM WAS,
YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS BEFORE

12:13.203 --> 12:15.505
THEY HAD ALL THE MEDS
THAT THEY HAVE TODAY,

12:15.505 --> 12:17.938
AND SHE WAS--I GUESS
SHE WAS DOING HER BEST.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.510
BUT MY DAD,
HE... WASN'T A GOOD GUY,

12:20.510 --> 12:23.273
AND HE WAS...
YOU KNOW...

12:23.273 --> 12:24.444
WHATEVER.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.447
AND SO ALEX, HE GOT
SHIPPED AROUND A LOT.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.150
AND... (chuckles) HE WAS
A PRETTY ROUGH KID

12:30.150 --> 12:31.451
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM,

12:31.451 --> 12:34.024
SO PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE
TO KEEP HIM.

12:34.024 --> 12:35.325
THEN HE ENDED UP
IN JUVIE.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.027
J-J-JUVENILE DETENTION?

12:37.027 --> 12:39.389
(chuckles) YEAH,
'CAUSE MY MOM, SHE--

12:39.389 --> 12:43.263
SOMETIMES SHE'D FORGET TO...
BUY FOOD, SO...

12:43.263 --> 12:45.165
HE WAS GOOD, THOUGH.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.337
PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN KNOWN
HE WAS STEALING ANYTHING

12:47.337 --> 12:50.340
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR THE VIDEO CAMERAS.
HOW OLD WAS HE?

12:50.340 --> 12:52.202
MM, 11, MAYBE 12.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.444
HEY, WHAT ARE WE DOING
WITH 28-07?

12:58.809 --> 13:00.951
DUDE, ARE YOU TALKING CRAP
IN HERE?

13:00.951 --> 13:03.153
NO.
DUDE, I WORK HERE.

13:03.153 --> 13:07.017
SO GO TO WORK. UH, CHECK
THE CHEST TUBE IN 28-07. GO.

13:07.017 --> 13:09.860
SHUT IT, AARON.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.794
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER JUVIE?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.227
DR. BAILEY, I DON'T THINK
THAT ALEX--

13:17.227 --> 13:19.269
MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
AARON, AFTER JUVIE?

13:19.269 --> 13:21.271
YOU COULDN'T EXPECT ME
TO JUST SIT THERE

13:21.271 --> 13:22.572
WITH A 10-71 IN PROGRESS.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.274
I HAD GOOD, SOLID INFORMATION

13:24.274 --> 13:26.276
THE PERPS WERE THREATENING
A 2-1-7.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.578
BABY, BABY,
YOUR DOCTORS ARE HERE.
UH, WE NEED TO TAKE YOU
TO SURGERY.

13:28.578 --> 13:31.581
KENNY, DID YOU GET THAT?
IT WAS A 10-71.
BABY, HE GOT THAT, OKAY?
BUT YOU GOTTA GO WITH THEM.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.283
WAIT! LOOK,
THIS IS IMPORTANT, OKAY?

13:33.283 --> 13:35.585
THEY'RE GONNA NEED
A STATEMENT.

13:35.585 --> 13:39.289
BABY, THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
TRYING TO SAVE YOUR JOB?
JIMMY--

13:39.289 --> 13:42.352
LISTEN, EVERY YEAR, YOU PROMISE
ME THAT ONCE YOU MAKE DETECTIVE,

13:42.352 --> 13:45.825
WE'RE GONNA... BUY A HOUSE,
HAVE A KID AND SETTLE DOWN.

13:45.825 --> 13:50.200
BUT... (exhales deeply)
BABY, IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.202
AND EVERY TIME YOU GET CLOSE
TO A PROMOTION,

13:52.202 --> 13:54.164
YOU GO DO SOMETHING STUPID.
BABY--

13:54.164 --> 13:56.907
AND NOW THESE PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE,

13:56.907 --> 13:58.909
AND YOU WANT 'EM TO WAIT.

13:58.909 --> 14:02.172
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND WATCH YOU DIE.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.174
I WANT A LIFE
WITH YOU, BABY.

14:04.174 --> 14:07.077
I WANT A LONG...

14:07.077 --> 14:09.149
HAPPY, BORING LIFE.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.256
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:16.256 --> 14:18.058
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU DID.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.190
I WAS TRYING TO WEAN HER
OFF THE VENTILATOR,

14:20.190 --> 14:23.193
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT
SHE WASN'T BREATHING ON HER OWN.

14:23.193 --> 14:26.196
SO I PUT HER BACK ON
HER PREVIOUS VENT SETTINGS.

14:26.196 --> 14:28.198
WH--DR. WEBBER,
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

14:28.198 --> 14:29.900
SHE MAY HAVE STROKED OUT.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.973
GET A C.T.
AND GET THE SCANS TO SHEPHERD

14:32.973 --> 14:34.474
AND ALSO RUN AN E.E.G.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.477
WE NEED TO FIND OUT RIGHT AWAY
IF THERE'S ANY BRAIN ACTIVITY.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.479
IF THERE'S NOT,
THEN WE NEED--

14:39.479 --> 14:41.351
SHE--SHE LOOKS GREAT.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.113
OH, THANK GOD.

14:43.113 --> 14:46.056
DR. GREY TOLD ME
YOU GOT THE TUMOR.

14:46.056 --> 14:48.318
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. WEBBER.

14:48.318 --> 14:51.061
CAN I WAKE HER?

14:51.061 --> 14:53.163
SWEETHEART?

14:53.163 --> 14:54.664
(chuckles) OH.

14:54.664 --> 14:57.567
YOU STILL SLEEPING?

14:57.567 --> 14:59.199
(sniffles)

14:59.199 --> 15:02.272
THE DOCTORS SAID
YOU DID GREAT IN THERE.

15:02.272 --> 15:03.633
HONEY?

15:03.633 --> 15:05.305
(sniffles)

15:05.305 --> 15:07.077
YOU AWAKE?

15:07.077 --> 15:09.179
ALISON?

15:09.179 --> 15:12.082
ALISON? (sniffles)

15:20.120 --> 15:22.122
OH, THE PATIENT'S HAD
A MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.424
LOOK, YOU SEE HERE?
THE LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.426
THE HEMORRHAGE, IT'S--
IT LOOKS LIKE IT--

15:26.426 --> 15:29.259
WOW. THAT BLEED IS HUGE.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.561
(elevator bell dings)
WHAT?

15:31.561 --> 15:33.933
YOU LOOK EVEN PRETTIER
IN YOUR SCRUBS.
(chuckles)

15:33.933 --> 15:36.236
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR GIANT STROKE?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.968
NOTHING.
NOTHING?

15:37.968 --> 15:41.241
YEAH. MRS. CLARK HAS
A LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE HEMORRHAGE

15:41.241 --> 15:43.313
THAT'S EXTENDED INTO
THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM.

15:43.313 --> 15:46.376
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
WANT TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE?

15:46.376 --> 15:49.249
ONLY IF YOU KEEP TELLING ME
HOW PRETTY I AM?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.581
I'VE GOT
THREE BOWEL INJURIES HERE.

15:51.581 --> 15:54.054
YOU GOT ANYTHING, AVERY?
I FOUND
WHAT DID THE DAMAGE.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.556
YOU SEE THE BULLET?
LODGED NEAR THE LIVER.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.428
(suction gurgling)

15:58.428 --> 16:01.161
TEDDY, I'M LOOKING
AT A DEVASTATOR.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.063
WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:03.063 --> 16:05.195
IT MEANS BE CAREFUL.
THEY'RE SHARP LIKE SHRAPNEL

16:05.195 --> 16:07.667
AND THEY EXPLODE ON IMPACT.
(Callie) CAN YOU IMAGINE
GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY

16:07.667 --> 16:11.701
KNOWING YOU'RE GONNA END UP
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A GUN?
(Cristina)
I KNOW. SHE IS AWESOME.

16:11.701 --> 16:15.045
AND NOW HER HUSBAND WANTS HER
TO GIVE IT ALL UP?

16:15.045 --> 16:17.077
HE'S ALL LIKE, "LET'S START
POPPING OUT BABIES

16:17.077 --> 16:19.479
OR I'M LEAVING YOU"?
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
ONE OR THE OTHER?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.251
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS

16:21.251 --> 16:23.713
IF YOU'RE FACING MORTAR FIRE
EVERY DAY.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.256
IT SCREWS WITH YOUR HEAD.
IS THAT WHY
YOU DON'T HAVE 'EM--IRAQ?

16:26.256 --> 16:28.988
WELL, FIRST IT WAS RESIDENCY,
AND THEN IT WAS IRAQ,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.991
AND NOW IT'S, I DON'T KNOW,
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT GUY?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.494
YOU WANT TO HAVE KIDS?
WAIT. YOU DON'T?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.496
HAVE YOU MET ME? NO.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.230
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:40.230 --> 16:43.203
OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.035
I THINK I FEEL IT.

16:45.035 --> 16:48.208
(Teddy) FEEL WHAT?
THE BULLET.
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE HEART.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.610
THERE'S STILL SOME BLEEDING.
DON'T WORRY. I GOT IT.
(bovie sizzles)

16:50.610 --> 16:52.442
NO, NO, NO, DON'T!
DON'T TOUCH IT!
(pop)

16:52.442 --> 16:55.345
OH, GOD! WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
DAMN IT, CRISTINA.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.647
YOU ESSENTIALLY FIRED A BULLET
INTO THAT PATIENT'S CHEST

16:57.647 --> 17:00.090
IS WHAT YOU DID.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.591
(monitor beeps erratically)

17:01.591 --> 17:03.293
THAT'S MY INTESTINE?

17:03.293 --> 17:05.295
YEAH, AND THAT PART
RIGHT THERE

17:05.295 --> 17:07.297
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ON
THE INSIDE OF THE MEMBRANE,

17:07.297 --> 17:09.299
NOT THE OUTSIDE.
DUDE, THAT IS SICK.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.501
CAN I GET A COPY
OF ONE OF THESE?

17:11.501 --> 17:14.704
I WANT TO HANG IT
FROM MY FRIDGE.
UH, HEY, ARE WE DOING CONSULTS
AT THE DESK NOWADAYS?

17:14.704 --> 17:18.168
'CAUSE I KINDA NEED
TO USE THE COMPUTER.
OH, THIS IS ALEX'S BROTHER.

17:18.168 --> 17:20.340
AARON,
THIS IS ARIZONA ROBBINS.
OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.412
HOW COME I DIDN'T MEET YOU
AT THE WEDDING?

17:22.412 --> 17:25.075
ACTUALLY, DR. ROBBINS--
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
NO ONE'S FAMILY CAME.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.617
LAST-MINUTE SWITCHEROO
AND ALL THAT. (chuckles)
WHAT WEDDING?

17:27.617 --> 17:29.719
UH, ALEX AND IZZIE'S
NO ONE'S.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.552
ALEX GOT MARRIED?
(elevator bell dings)

17:32.552 --> 17:34.784
I'M JUST GONNA GO USE
THE COMPUTER OVER THERE. BYE.

17:34.784 --> 17:37.287
HE GOT MARRIED
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL US?

17:37.287 --> 17:39.189
(mouths word)
NO, IT--IT--IT SOUNDS WEIRD,

17:39.189 --> 17:42.061
BUT IT WAS TOTALLY
A SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT THING,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.264
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE OF THE CANCER.
ALEX HAS CANCER?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.595
LEXIE--
NO, IZZIE HAS CANCER.

17:45.595 --> 17:47.637
WHO'S IZZIE?
ALEX'S WIFE.

17:47.637 --> 17:50.600
BUT... (stammers) SHE'S NOT
REALLY HIS WIFE ANYMORE.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.243
IT'S--YOU KNOW, I-I REALLY,
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THEY GOT DIVORCED?

17:53.243 --> 17:55.245
NO, BUT THEY A--
WELL, S-SHE LEFT.

17:55.245 --> 17:58.108
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
SHE CAME BACK.

17:58.108 --> 18:02.152
BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY THINK
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING--OKAY.
LEXIE. STOP TALKING.

18:02.152 --> 18:05.255
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
(Callie) YOU GUYS
ALL RIGHT UP THERE?

18:05.255 --> 18:08.258
THERE IS
SHRAPNEL EVERYWHERE.
I WAS GOING FOR THE BLEEDER.
I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE BULLET.

18:08.258 --> 18:11.691
I SWEAR. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.
WHEN YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER
TELLS YOU TO STAND DOWN,

18:11.691 --> 18:14.164
YOU STAND DOWN.
GIVE ME THAT.

18:14.164 --> 18:17.297
I'M NOT IN THE ARMY. AND YOU'RE
NOT MY COMMANDING OFFICER.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.299
(exhales) DR. ALTMAN AND I
ARE YOUR ATTENDING.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.831
AND YOU ARE OUR SUBORDINATE.

18:21.831 --> 18:24.374
YOU DO EXACTLY AS WE SAY
EVEN IF YOU DO NOT AGREE.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.207
DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WE
KNOW MORE THAN YOU DO.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.209
FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW
THAT DEVASTATOR BULLETS

18:29.209 --> 18:30.510
HAVE CHEMICALS IN THEM,

18:30.510 --> 18:32.782
AND SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT
DETONATE ON IMPACT.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.784
SOMETIMES THE HEAT
FROM THAT BOVIE

18:34.784 --> 18:36.846
IS ENOUGH
TO MAKE THEM EXPLODE.

18:36.846 --> 18:39.289
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
DR. YANG, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,
DR. HUNT,

18:39.289 --> 18:41.291
I WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME THING YANG DID.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.194
ANYBODY WOULD.
IF IT'S A BLEEDER--
(Teddy)
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.

18:44.194 --> 18:47.257
THERE'S NO POINT IN ARGUING
ABOUT IT. LET'S JUST FIX IT.

18:47.257 --> 18:50.330
YANG, I NEED YOUR HANDS
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.333
OKAY, YOU SEE THIS?
HOLD IT.
YEAH. MM-HMM.

18:54.904 --> 18:58.468
HEY.
DUDE, HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE
TOLD ME YOU GOT MARRIED?

18:58.468 --> 19:00.440
YOU TOLD HIM?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.813
NO. NO. IT--IT WASN'T ME.
W-WELL, SOME OF IT WAS, BUT--

19:03.813 --> 19:06.316
IT WAS ARIZONA ROBBINS,
AND IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:06.316 --> 19:08.748
YEAH, SHE FIGURED YOUR OWN
BROTHER WOULD ALREADY KNOW

19:08.748 --> 19:11.721
THAT YOU MARRIED SOMEBODY,
BUT, HEY--
SEE, THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU,

19:11.721 --> 19:14.424
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.
YOU GET MARRIED

19:14.424 --> 19:17.457
ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT,
YOU WALK OUT ON YOUR WIFE--
I DID NOT WALK OUT ON MY WIFE.
SHE WALKED OUT ON ME.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.159
SHE WALKED OUT.
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT MOM'S
GONNA DO WHEN SHE FINDS OUT?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.532
SHE'S GONNA GO OFF HER MEDS.
SHE'S NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING

19:22.532 --> 19:24.534
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL HER, ALL RIGHT?

19:24.534 --> 19:26.366
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR FREE SURGERY,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.368
YOU'RE GONNA
GET BACK IN YOUR TRUCK,

19:28.368 --> 19:30.370
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.872
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED YOUR FREE SURGERY.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.374
I'LL SEE YA.
AARON, STOP.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.276
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I DON'T NEED YOUR CRAP!

19:36.276 --> 19:38.608
YOU WALK OUT ON US,
YOU WALK OUT ON YOUR WIFE?

19:38.608 --> 19:41.351
(scoffs)
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.
TAKE THAT BACK.

19:41.351 --> 19:43.313
GET OFF ME, MAN.
TAKE IT BACK!

19:43.313 --> 19:44.614
(crack)

19:44.614 --> 19:47.417
(pants)

19:47.417 --> 19:48.818
(Meredith) ALEX!
(grunts)

19:57.367 --> 19:59.369
GET OFF ME, MAN!
(Lexie and Meredith) ALEX!

19:59.369 --> 20:02.332
WHAT ARE YOU TWO FOOLS--
OH, NO, THIS IS NOT HAP--ALEX!
GET OFF!

20:02.332 --> 20:04.574
KAREV!
WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?!

20:04.574 --> 20:06.636
YOU ARE!
HEY, HEY, HEY!

20:06.636 --> 20:09.239
ALEX!
YOU HITTING PEOPLE NOW, TOO?
YOU REALLY DID TURN INTO DAD.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.741
WALK AWAY. ALEX, WALK AWAY.
JUST WALK AWAY.

20:11.741 --> 20:13.343
OH! (groaning)
UH-HUH.

20:13.343 --> 20:16.286
UM, GIVE HIM SOME SPACE, OKAY?
DON'T FOLLOW HIM.
OKAY.

20:16.286 --> 20:18.918
HEY, UH, I NEED A GURNEY.
RUN, HONEY.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.291
SHE COULD WAKE UP, RIGHT?

20:21.291 --> 20:24.324
I MEAN, PEOPLE WAKE UP
FROM COMAS ALL THE TIME.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.825
I'M SORRY.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.298
YOUR WIFE'S COMA
IS IRREVERSIBLE.

20:28.298 --> 20:32.402
DR. GREY, WOULD YOU
EXPLAIN IT, PLEASE?

20:32.402 --> 20:33.563
(sighs)

20:33.563 --> 20:36.336
MRS. CLARK'S SCANS
SHOWED A MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE

20:36.336 --> 20:37.837
IN HER BRAIN.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.341
AND THE E.E.G. SHOWED
MINIMAL BRAIN ACTIVITY.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.573
BUT THAT MEANS
THERE'S HOPE, RIGHT?

20:43.573 --> 20:47.447
BECAUSE...
AT LEAST THERE'S ACTIVITY.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.849
AND--AND HER HEART
IS STILL BEATING.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.851
ONLY BECAUSE
THE MECHANICAL VENTILATOR

20:51.851 --> 20:54.023
IS BREATHING FOR HER.

20:54.023 --> 20:55.855
WHEN WE TURN
THE MACHINE OFF,

20:55.855 --> 20:59.389
THE HEART WON'T GET THE OXYGEN
IT NEEDS, AND IT WILL STOP.

20:59.389 --> 21:01.331
WHY WOULD YOU TURN IT OFF?

21:01.331 --> 21:03.863
PEOPLE CAN LIVE FOR YEARS
ON THESE MACHINES.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.366
MR. CLARK, THE ADVANCED
DIRECTIVE YOUR WIFE SIGNED

21:06.366 --> 21:08.438
SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED
NO MECHANICAL VENTILATION.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.370
SHE FILLED THAT FORM OUT

21:10.370 --> 21:12.672
THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE CANCER
WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.705
THE DOCTOR TOLD HER
SHE HAD SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.

21:15.705 --> 21:17.707
AND SHE HELD ON
FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS.

21:17.707 --> 21:20.510
SHE'LL COME BACK
FROM THIS, TOO. YOU'LL SEE.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.011
YOU CAN'T UNPLUG HER.

21:22.011 --> 21:24.614
(Richard) LEGALLY,
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, SIR.

21:24.614 --> 21:26.916
BUT... SHE'S MY WIFE.

21:26.916 --> 21:28.418
IT'S MY CHOICE.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.760
IT'S YOUR WIFE'S CHOICE...

21:30.760 --> 21:34.824
AND SHE MADE IT
THREE YEARS AGO.

21:34.824 --> 21:38.067
YOU SAID THE SURGERY
WENT FINE.

21:38.067 --> 21:40.870
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
IT DID. BUT--

21:40.870 --> 21:43.733
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.
YOU'RE A CHILD!

21:43.733 --> 21:47.337
AND YOU'RE USELESS!
I'M DONE TALKING WITH YOU.

21:47.337 --> 21:50.380
I'M DONE TALKING
WITH ALL OF YOU.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.343
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

21:53.343 --> 21:57.447
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

21:57.447 --> 22:00.019
HE PROTECTED ME
MY WHOLE LIFE, YOU KNOW?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.021
KICKED MY DAD'S ASS SO HARD,

22:02.021 --> 22:04.023
THE SON OF A BITCH
NEVER CAME BACK.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.856
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE DID THAT FOR ME.

22:06.856 --> 22:10.329
BUT MAYBE HE JUST LIKES
THROWING PUNCHES.
AARON, I LIKE YOU.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.433
I DO, BUT YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT
MY FRIEND THAT WAY. OKAY?

22:13.433 --> 22:16.366
I NEED YOU TO COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM TEN FOR ME, OKAY?

22:16.366 --> 22:17.767
OKAY.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.769
TEN.

22:19.769 --> 22:21.941
(muffled voice) NINE.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.113
EIGHT.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.946
THAT'S IT.

22:26.946 --> 22:30.119
A JUNKIE DAD,
A CRACKPOT MOM,

22:30.119 --> 22:32.852
AND SOMEHOW KAREV
STILL BECAME A DOCTOR.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.855
I'M NOT EASILY IMPRESSED,
BUT I'M IMPRESSED.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.128
UH, PREP HIM.
WE'LL GO SCRUB.
(woman) YES, DOCTOR.

22:44.434 --> 22:45.735
DR. GREY.

22:45.735 --> 22:48.668
WE'RE MEETING GARY CLARK
IN SHEPHERD'S OFFICE.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.971
FIVE MINUTES.

22:55.505 --> 23:00.610
I TOLD A PATIENT'S HUSBAND
THAT... SHE WAS FINE,

23:00.610 --> 23:02.712
THAT HER SURGERY
WENT PERFECTLY.

23:02.712 --> 23:05.715
AND THE NEXT THING WE KNOW,
SHE HAS A STROKE,

23:05.715 --> 23:08.888
AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO
JUST UNPLUG HER.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.891
AND I KNOW--I KNOW THAT I AM
SUPPOSED TO TOUGHEN UP.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.764
I KNOW THAT I AM
SUPPOSED TO NOT CARE,

23:14.764 --> 23:19.098
BUT HOW...
H-HOW DO YOU NOT CARE?

23:19.098 --> 23:21.471
(clicks pen)

23:21.471 --> 23:23.833
(exhales deeply)

23:25.505 --> 23:28.608
IT'S THE HARDEST PART
OF THE JOB...

23:28.608 --> 23:30.710
THE VERY HARDEST PART.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.112
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.785
HOW DID YOU LEARN?

23:35.785 --> 23:38.748
I'M STILL LEARNING.

23:45.795 --> 23:48.698
WHY IS HER B.P. STILL LOW?
IS SHE STILL BLEEDING UP THERE?

23:48.698 --> 23:51.701
NO, I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
WE'VE HAD L.R. AND BLOOD HANGING
SINCE WE GOT HERE,

23:51.701 --> 23:54.103
BUT WE CAN'T SEEM TO CATCH UP.
IS HER LIVER STILL BLEEDING?

23:54.103 --> 23:56.936
(Owen) NO, I THINK WE GOT IT.
NO, DR. HUNT,
DR. TORRES IS RIGHT.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.469
THERE'S STILL BLEEDING
IN THE RETROPERITONEUM.
(Owen) WE NEED
A RETRACTOR IN HERE.

23:59.469 --> 24:02.542
(Callie) THAT'S A LOT OF BLOOD.
AVERY, GET IN THERE, SUCTION.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.114
CAN YOU SEE
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM?
I CAN'T SEE PAST THE CLOTS.
AVERY?

24:05.114 --> 24:07.146
THE SUCTION'S CLOGGING NOW.
LET'S USE OUR HANDS AND SCOOP.
COME ON. LET'S GET IN THERE.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.178
(Callie) DID YOU CHECK
THE UTERINE ARTERY?

24:09.178 --> 24:12.051
THAT COULD BE THE SOURCE.
DOWN TO 64 OVER 32.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.884
WE GOTTA STOP THIS THING
OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER.
IF WE HADN'T BEEN DISTRACTED
BY ARTILLERY IN THE O.R.,

24:14.884 --> 24:18.157
WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND
THIS BLEED EARLIER.
HUNT, NOT NOW.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.591
(monitor beeping erratically)

24:21.591 --> 24:24.033
(suction gurgles)

24:36.475 --> 24:39.478
(drain gurgling)

24:45.515 --> 24:46.816
(exhales)

24:46.816 --> 24:48.518
(door opens)

24:48.518 --> 24:50.660
(sighs)
THAT WAS, UM...

24:50.660 --> 24:53.663
THAT WAS OUR FAULT IN THERE.
WE WERE SPEAKING IN SHORTHAND.

24:53.663 --> 24:55.665
WE FORGET SOMETIMES THAT
YOU GUYS ARE CIVILIANS

24:55.665 --> 24:58.497
AND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT BALLISTICS.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.270
NO, IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
IT WAS...

25:01.270 --> 25:04.233
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

25:04.233 --> 25:07.206
HE'S BEEN...

25:07.206 --> 25:09.238
IT'S BEEN...

25:09.238 --> 25:11.981
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH.

25:11.981 --> 25:14.814
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE TALKS ABOUT IT.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.515
HE CAN'T.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.518
I MEAN, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
EITHER MOST DAYS.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.951
BUT... OWEN HAD IT
WORSE THAN ME.

25:21.951 --> 25:23.923
HE HAS IT WORSE.
HE'S TRIGGERED.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.224
RIGHT NOW, HE'S TRIGGERED,

25:25.224 --> 25:27.226
AND HIS TRIGGERS
MIGHT NEVER GO AWAY.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.699
I MEAN, THEY'LL GET BETTER
OVER TIME,

25:29.699 --> 25:31.701
IF YOU GIVE HIM TIME,
WHICH YOU SHOULD,

25:31.701 --> 25:34.233
BECAUSE HE IS IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.105
HE JUST NEEDS TIME.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.607
HE NEEDS THERAPY.

25:37.607 --> 25:40.109
I-I KEEP TELLING HIM
TO GO TO DR. WYATT--

25:40.109 --> 25:42.612
NO, DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T DO THAT.

25:42.612 --> 25:44.614
HE WON'T GO
IF YOU TELL HIM TO.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.716
HE'S... HE'S VERY...

25:46.716 --> 25:49.048
HE'S A GUY THAT WAY,
A MAN.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.050
DON'T EVER TELL HIM
WHAT TO DO.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.223
JUST... JUST TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL.

25:54.223 --> 25:57.186
(trash can clatters)

26:01.260 --> 26:05.264
WHEN'S THE BEST TIME
TO HAVE KIDS?

26:05.264 --> 26:09.068
THE BEST TIME
TO HAVE KIDS...

26:09.068 --> 26:10.640
IS NEVER.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.201
(chuckles)

26:12.201 --> 26:13.973
(laughs)
WELL, YOU ASKED.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.274
WELL, YEAH, BUT--

26:15.274 --> 26:18.277
THEY CRY ALL THE TIME,
NONSTOP.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.980
THEY NEVER SLEEP. THEY'RE
TERRIBLE CONVERSATIONALISTS.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.152
AND THEY TAKE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT--

26:23.152 --> 26:25.785
ALL YOUR TIME, ALL YOUR FOCUS,
ALL YOUR PATIENCE,

26:25.785 --> 26:27.186
ALL YOUR SLEEP--

26:27.186 --> 26:30.660
EVERYTHING--TILL YOU GOT
NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.091
WOW.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.323
(sighs) BUT THIS MORNING...

26:34.323 --> 26:36.325
LITTLE TUCK WOKE ME UP

26:36.325 --> 26:39.629
BY... PUTTING HIS NOSE
UP AGAINST MINE--

26:39.629 --> 26:41.931
HIS COLD, LITTLE NOSE.

26:41.931 --> 26:46.335
AND HE GOES, "WAKE UP."

26:46.335 --> 26:49.338
AND HE GOT THE "K" SOUND
IN "WAKE." "WAKE UP."

26:49.338 --> 26:52.341
SEE, UP UNTIL TODAY,
HE'D SAY "D" INSTEAD OF "K."

26:52.341 --> 26:54.784
"WADE UP."
(chuckles)

26:54.784 --> 26:59.348
(laughs) HA! GIRL,
HIM NAILING THAT "K" SOUND...

26:59.348 --> 27:01.220
IT'S THE PRIDE I FELT,

27:01.220 --> 27:06.195
THE IRRATIONAL,
UNBRIDLED, JOY...

27:06.195 --> 27:09.999
WELL, IT'S AT LEAST AS GOOD
AS ANY WHIPPLE.

27:09.999 --> 27:13.002
LOOK, IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR
THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE KIDS,

27:13.002 --> 27:16.265
YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO HAVE KIDS.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.370
(exhales deeply)

27:25.344 --> 27:27.777
HEY.

27:27.777 --> 27:30.780
AARON'S SURGERY
WENT WELL.

27:30.780 --> 27:33.883
HIS HERNIA DEFECT
WAS FAIRLY LARGE,

27:33.883 --> 27:37.386
BUT BAILEY WAS ABLE
TO USE MESH TO BRIDGE IT.

27:37.386 --> 27:39.328
SO...

27:41.230 --> 27:43.232
HE'LL BE WAKING UP
IN A FEW MINUTES

27:43.232 --> 27:45.394
IF YOU WANT TO STOP BY.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.273
MR. CLARK,
I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR--

27:54.273 --> 27:56.846
FOR YOUR LOSS.

27:56.846 --> 27:58.848
