00:44.343 --> 00:46.345
The instant high that you get from when, you know,

00:46.377 --> 00:48.514
10,000 people are laughing their heads off.

00:48.547 --> 00:52.752
What's your brain doing? What are your neuro transmitters doing?

00:52.785 --> 00:56.923
The human brain is, you know, an extraordinary three and a half pound gland,

00:56.956 --> 01:00.392
that is like quantum... it's quantum neurology, it's quantum physiology,

01:00.426 --> 01:01.794
that the moment you think you understand that it,

01:01.826 --> 01:04.596
it comes up with something else.

01:04.629 --> 01:08.768
Because I don't have an act per se, but more a cesspool of consciousness,

01:08.800 --> 01:12.571
just, you know, ideas.

01:12.604 --> 01:16.508
Moments when I'll be on a roll or something will happen that I'll fire off,

01:16.541 --> 01:18.911
and you can't have... it's like being possessed. It's like channeling.

01:21.479 --> 01:24.249
When it works it's great, and when it doesn't, it's painful.

01:24.283 --> 01:25.585
But when it's working,

01:25.618 --> 01:27.152
it's that, it's that weird thing about you're surfing,

01:27.185 --> 01:30.389
and kind of like you're in, you know, that thing athletes describe it

01:30.422 --> 01:33.226
as the same thing of being, "Oh, it's working."

02:03.721 --> 02:05.557
My name is Susan Schneider Williams,

02:06.458 --> 02:07.994
my husband Robin Williams...

02:09.495 --> 02:11.430
Two sentences, Leonard.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.431
It all happens in two sentences.

02:13.465 --> 02:16.602
We had unknowingly been battling a deadly disease.

02:16.634 --> 02:19.471
A disease for which there is no cure.

02:19.505 --> 02:22.775
Robin's... The devastation on Robin's brain from Lewy Bodies

02:22.807 --> 02:26.846
was one of the worst cases medical professionals have ever seen.

02:26.878 --> 02:29.983
Yet throughout all of this, his heart remained strong.

02:31.382 --> 02:32.384
Unchosen path.

02:39.557 --> 02:41.359
When Robin started acting out of character,

02:41.393 --> 02:44.563
nearly every region of his brain was under attack by Lewy Bodies.

02:49.734 --> 02:54.506
Can you imagine the pain he felt as he experienced himself disintegrating,

02:54.539 --> 02:58.443
and not from something he would ever know the name of or understand.

03:13.925 --> 03:17.029
So, um, I hate to have to report this.

03:17.061 --> 03:19.431
The breaking news just in to CNN

03:19.465 --> 03:22.902
is that actor Robin Williams is dead at the age of 63.

03:22.935 --> 03:25.371
We have just received word from the West Coast.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.440
Tragic, devastating word.

03:27.472 --> 03:31.009
Robin Williams has been confirmed dead.

03:31.043 --> 03:35.014
They believe that the Bay area resident committed suicide.

03:35.047 --> 03:37.917
We do know that at 11:55 this morning,

03:37.949 --> 03:42.020
Marin County communications received a 911 telephone call,

03:42.054 --> 03:45.124
reporting that a male adult had been located unconscious,

03:45.156 --> 03:47.493
and not breathing inside his residence,

03:47.525 --> 03:49.828
in unincorporated Tiburon, California.

03:55.434 --> 03:58.770
I felt... tremendous remorse,

03:58.804 --> 04:04.043
and guilt that, "Gosh, I could have done more. I should have done more."

04:08.013 --> 04:10.015
I know that something must've been terribly wrong

04:10.048 --> 04:14.821
for someone as brilliant as Robin to just, you know, jump ship like that.

04:17.454 --> 04:19.958
In the immediate aftermath of Robin's death,

04:19.991 --> 04:24.896
the confusion and information was constantly changing.

04:24.929 --> 04:27.098
Robin Williams' battle with addiction

04:27.131 --> 04:29.067
and mental illness was no secret.

04:30.099 --> 04:33.071
Before the coroner's report came out,

04:33.104 --> 04:36.141
there was a lot of media speculation.

04:37.876 --> 04:39.779
People who are assuming the worst,

04:39.811 --> 04:42.181
that he's broke, or he's depressed, or is just given up.

04:42.213 --> 04:45.116
The highs are highs and the lows are lows,

04:45.150 --> 04:49.688
and there's nothing sadder than when a comedian is by himself.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.857
They painted him as the sad clown.

04:52.890 --> 04:56.729
Those close to Williams believe he had bipolar disorder.

04:56.761 --> 04:58.830
They thought he just committed suicide

04:58.864 --> 05:03.669
for something related to unhappiness, drugs or depression.

05:03.701 --> 05:06.438
And of course, none of that is true.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.508
...on Robin Williams' mind before his death, money.

05:10.542 --> 05:13.512
- While it may seem strange... - People fill in the blanks,

05:13.544 --> 05:16.848
um, so a lot of that was going on.

05:16.881 --> 05:20.151
That last evening I spent with him, he was...

05:20.184 --> 05:23.988
he was completely sober and not on drugs,

05:24.022 --> 05:29.929
but just most, uh, troubled by what he was going through.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.131
I think it's important that the truth comes out

05:32.164 --> 05:36.836
because there were so many affirmative things that Robin stood for,

05:36.869 --> 05:38.837
and we want to believe in all of them.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.006
We want to believe in him.

05:41.039 --> 05:46.111
And there's a danger that his suicide could occasion people to think,

05:46.143 --> 05:48.881
"Oh, well he wasn't what we thought he was.

05:48.914 --> 05:50.783
"We didn't know him after all."

05:51.583 --> 05:53.852
Um, but we did.

05:53.886 --> 05:57.857
I felt like I was somehow being loyal to him

05:57.890 --> 06:00.726
by not speaking about the struggles that we saw.

06:00.758 --> 06:03.895
I think we felt that wasn't anyone's business.

06:03.929 --> 06:08.000
And so the story is one of Robin being at the mercy

06:08.032 --> 06:10.970
of something that you could not control.

06:11.003 --> 06:14.874
And even worse than not being able to control it, not even knowing about it.

06:17.643 --> 06:20.880
It was not till October,

06:20.912 --> 06:24.249
I was called in to sit down to go over the coroner's report.

06:24.282 --> 06:27.753
There were no surprises about what was in his toxicology,

06:27.785 --> 06:29.153
I knew my honey was clean and sober.

06:29.186 --> 06:32.691
They sat me down and said,

06:32.724 --> 06:38.631
"Essentially Robin died of diffuse Lewy Body Dementia."

06:40.732 --> 06:42.133
"What is that?"

06:42.167 --> 06:44.703
They started to talk about the neuro degeneration.

06:44.736 --> 06:47.640
He wasn't in his right mind.

06:47.672 --> 06:49.708
He described how these were these Lewy Bodies

06:49.741 --> 06:53.812
that were in nearly every region of his brain.

06:53.845 --> 06:59.285
It makes sense why he was experiencing what he was experiencing.

06:59.318 --> 07:03.289
Cognitive moods, movement, they were all affected.

07:03.321 --> 07:06.691
Depression, a fear, anxiety, hallucinations,

07:06.725 --> 07:11.162
delusional thinking, major sleep disorders, insomnia, paranoia.

07:12.097 --> 07:15.133
I remember walking out of that facility,

07:15.167 --> 07:18.604
down the steps outside and feeling,

07:18.636 --> 07:21.139
"Now I have the name of it."

07:21.172 --> 07:25.710
It was the beginning of understanding what had really gone on.

07:26.979 --> 07:30.316
I was talking to someone I'd met at UCSF,

07:30.349 --> 07:34.119
and she said, "Send me the last two years of the medical records,

07:34.152 --> 07:38.090
"I'll get them to Dr. Miller and I know he'll be happy to see you."

07:38.123 --> 07:42.227
Lewy Body Dementia is a devastating illness.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.965
It's a killer. It is fast. It's progressive.

07:45.998 --> 07:49.768
I'm looking at how Robin's brain had been affected.

07:49.801 --> 07:54.106
I realized that this was about as devastating form

07:54.138 --> 07:57.342
of Lewy Body Dementia as I had ever seen.

07:57.376 --> 08:00.979
Almost no area was left unaffected.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.784
It really amazed me that Robin could walk or move at all.

08:07.419 --> 08:09.655
The disease is devastating,

08:09.688 --> 08:12.157
but even more so when you realize that

08:12.189 --> 08:14.059
Robin did not have a diagnosis.

08:14.092 --> 08:17.897
He did not know where these new symptoms were coming from.

08:19.797 --> 08:23.701
The disease becomes progressively irreversible,

08:23.734 --> 08:27.706
unstoppable, uh, and always fatal, always fatal.

08:31.242 --> 08:34.212
But cures, we're far away from those.

08:34.245 --> 08:38.850
It affects many people and sadly one of the outcomes is suicide.

08:45.757 --> 08:50.262
If we'd had the accurate diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia,

08:50.295 --> 08:52.298
that alone would have given him...

08:53.864 --> 08:55.033
some peace.

09:05.911 --> 09:08.013
His soul thrived here.

09:09.413 --> 09:11.316
He grew up here. His roots were here.

09:11.349 --> 09:13.985
I mean, he... he started in Detroit,

09:14.018 --> 09:16.422
but he went to school here in Redwood.

09:24.428 --> 09:29.033
Robin could live anywhere he wanted and chose to live in a neighborhood.

09:29.066 --> 09:31.235
Living in Marin, which is kind of like, you know,

09:31.268 --> 09:32.736
north of San Francisco

09:32.771 --> 09:37.109
it's like, it's the idea of, "This is it. I don't need to live...

09:37.142 --> 09:41.146
"I can't. I mean, I don't do well in LA, if I was living in a gated community."

09:41.178 --> 09:44.215
And he said, "I want to live with people. I love people."

09:46.283 --> 09:50.489
He liked Marin, it's a wonderful, beautiful place to live.

09:50.522 --> 09:54.926
He would ride his bikes every day.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.796
You ran into him walking his dog outside

09:57.829 --> 10:00.965
and you're like, "Oh, he's a totally normal guy."

10:00.999 --> 10:05.303
You know, really not that different, people walking dogs, saying hello.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.004
He's just trying to be normal.

10:07.037 --> 10:11.943
But then on the flip side, like, he's lived a crazy life.

10:11.976 --> 10:13.745
You would never know he was a superstar.

10:16.815 --> 10:18.249
The Throckmorton Theatre in Mill Valley

10:18.282 --> 10:20.384
started doing the Tuesday Night comedy nights.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.885
It was just comedy.

10:21.920 --> 10:26.258
Yet it exploded and partly because Robin Williams lived down the street.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.292
So all of a sudden,

10:27.325 --> 10:30.095
you've got an open mic more or less on Tuesday

10:30.128 --> 10:33.831
that's drawing 250 people, on Tuesday. Every Tuesday.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.334
The audience would go crazy.

10:35.367 --> 10:38.437
And Robin would come up after I already had a show,

10:38.470 --> 10:41.038
and we would do another two hours of improv.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.807
And this would happen all the time.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.109
And he literally would just get up at the end of the night,

10:45.143 --> 10:47.812
and he would just crush it with no content.

10:47.845 --> 10:51.249
Nothing got him off as much as being in front of a live audience,

10:51.282 --> 10:54.952
and getting to just free float and let his brain take him

10:54.985 --> 10:56.922
where he's going and react with the audience.

10:56.955 --> 10:58.523
If someone throws something in from there,

10:58.556 --> 11:01.926
or just take what he's saying and do 300 rifts on that.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.829
His mind was just so fast.

11:05.397 --> 11:06.732
Look out there, there's a little kid out there.

11:06.764 --> 11:10.301
I saw a three-year-old kid who could barely use a fork or spoon.

11:10.335 --> 11:12.470
He's eating, he's eating blueberries with his hands,

11:12.503 --> 11:15.440
and all of a sudden someone handed him an iPhone, he was like...

11:18.243 --> 11:19.978
When you're playing with Robin Williams,

11:20.010 --> 11:23.347
you're not known for how you neck and neck with him.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.850
You're not known for how you beat him.

11:25.883 --> 11:29.220
You're known for how you just barely keep up with him.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.989
Look up here Rick, there's people on the Hills.

11:32.023 --> 11:33.892
Hi, everybody on the Hills.

11:33.925 --> 11:36.862
Screaming on the mount.

11:36.894 --> 11:39.430
- Did Jesus have comedy day? - Jesus had comedy day.

11:39.464 --> 11:40.999
I'll be back.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.402
There'd be improvs where I'm on stage with Robin,

11:43.435 --> 11:44.902
and we would sync up,

11:44.936 --> 11:50.341
and to see that in his eyes, that twinkle that means we made it.

11:50.374 --> 11:54.145
It's impossible to describe genius or comedy really. You can analyze it.

11:54.178 --> 11:59.116
But I went with him to two days of Aladdin recording sessions on the Disney lot,

11:59.149 --> 12:00.585
and watching him go back and forth,

12:00.619 --> 12:02.253
and do all of these characters.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.355
Let's blow this popsicle stand!

12:04.388 --> 12:06.291
A doorstop would be a fabulous career.

12:06.324 --> 12:09.928
Not bad, goodnight, Alex.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.930
Out of all of every pore of his being,

12:11.963 --> 12:13.198
and he was so happy and joyous.

12:13.230 --> 12:16.000
Hey. Go get him here, you little crazy guy.

12:16.033 --> 12:20.605
I don't care what I am, I'm free.

12:20.638 --> 12:23.075
Offer void or prohibited by law.

12:23.108 --> 12:24.443
He goes, "Let's do that again, I could do that better."

12:24.475 --> 12:26.077
And they go, "What do you mean you can do it better?"

12:26.110 --> 12:28.479
He goes, "No, just let me, just run it again. I think I have an idea, you know."

12:28.513 --> 12:32.184
"You think you have an idea, good Lord. Oh my God."

12:32.216 --> 12:33.417
I think the man has to flow.

12:33.451 --> 12:36.287
He has to be able to come in there and go against the magic.

12:36.321 --> 12:39.191
He's got his own magic, and he just hasn't found it in himself yet.

12:39.224 --> 12:41.560
Unnecessary use of reptile, 500 year penalty.

12:41.593 --> 12:45.063
Watching these technicians desperately laughing and crying,

12:45.095 --> 12:48.066
trying to keep up with him and not screw up the dials

12:48.099 --> 12:50.636
while they're witnessing true brilliance.

12:50.668 --> 12:55.106
Enough about you. Talk about her. She's a honey.

12:55.139 --> 12:57.308
Come on. Talk about the features.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.677
Her hair, her eyes, her shoes,

12:59.710 --> 13:03.347
bee-guiling, bee-witching, bee-utiful.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.117
When you're in the room with Robin, it is full go.

13:07.484 --> 13:08.853
- Um, thank you. - Not at all.

13:08.887 --> 13:12.357
Theodore Roosevelt, 26th president of these United States of America,

13:12.389 --> 13:13.591
at your service.

13:13.624 --> 13:17.028
He was a constant spark,

13:17.061 --> 13:20.264
comedic spark, idea spark, throwing in lines,

13:20.297 --> 13:22.234
improvising a ton.

13:22.267 --> 13:26.271
Some of the biggest laughs are things that Robin invented on the fly.

13:26.303 --> 13:30.608
I remember many, many days where Ben Stiller and I would look at each other

13:30.642 --> 13:35.347
because we're just watching Robin Williams off the top of his head just go off.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.350
And that kind of manic,

13:38.383 --> 13:42.321
wildly creative, bottomless pit of ideas.

13:42.354 --> 13:46.191
Um, that mojo, that ability,

13:46.224 --> 13:47.993
which was like a superpower.

13:48.026 --> 13:49.428
I'd never seen anything like it.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.063
Let go.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.970
The thing to know about the brain is that it's not static.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.672
The connections are always changing.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.507
We call it neuroplasticity.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.376
So you have someone who has a stroke,

14:04.408 --> 14:07.244
a part of the brain is damaged, it's not coming back.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.013
Some of those patients get completely better

14:09.047 --> 14:12.283
because the brain rewires, it has this resilience.

14:12.316 --> 14:15.519
And the determinants of resilience, we don't quite understand.

14:15.552 --> 14:18.489
But high intellectual abilities to begin with,

14:18.523 --> 14:21.726
seem to go along with that kind of resilience.

14:22.793 --> 14:26.063
People who have great brains,

14:26.096 --> 14:30.167
who are incredibly brilliant, can tolerate degenerative diseases

14:30.200 --> 14:33.305
better than someone who is average.

14:33.338 --> 14:37.142
The concept of reserve, Robin Williams was a genius.

14:42.814 --> 14:46.218
Robin was brilliant, he just knew things.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.521
But besides that, his... his extrasensory perception

14:50.555 --> 14:53.291
of life and of people and of me,

14:53.324 --> 14:55.227
he was a master at that.

15:01.398 --> 15:04.068
You could track it back to two years before he left.

15:06.104 --> 15:08.239
We'd go to the Throckmorton all the time.

15:08.273 --> 15:10.408
He always had an open invitation to go on.

15:10.441 --> 15:12.744
And what started to happen at around two years

15:12.777 --> 15:17.449
is he started to feel, um, like he didn't want to go on.

15:19.216 --> 15:21.552
He just wasn't as eager

15:21.585 --> 15:25.190
to, uh, meet with people backstage,

15:25.223 --> 15:27.225
or hang out too long in the green room.

15:27.258 --> 15:31.662
It was getting a little bit briefer and he didn't, um,

15:31.696 --> 15:37.335
he just... there were more insecurities cropping up for him about going onstage.

15:37.368 --> 15:40.472
There were a couple of shows where I was expecting Robin to be there,

15:40.504 --> 15:43.408
and he didn't make it for one reason or another.

15:45.442 --> 15:48.479
So that... that confidence that he had,

15:48.513 --> 15:52.350
and the ability to go on and play...

15:52.383 --> 15:55.821
He just wasn't willing to go there as much anymore, it was starting to lessen.

15:55.854 --> 15:58.757
That was concerning. Something's off.

16:02.627 --> 16:05.430
Someone is seemingly performing

16:05.463 --> 16:08.633
just as they had, you know, for years and years,

16:08.666 --> 16:11.503
and then all of a sudden there's some very strange thing that happens,

16:11.536 --> 16:14.773
uh, and that raises concern,

16:14.806 --> 16:16.740
but then the next day they're okay again.

16:16.773 --> 16:21.345
And then over time those dips become deeper and deeper,

16:21.378 --> 16:25.683
and we have these fluctuations, especially in the beginning.

16:25.716 --> 16:29.253
The last thing they probably think of is that it's a degenerative brain disease.

16:32.624 --> 16:37.162
After that, things were... just, life was busy, you know.

16:37.195 --> 16:40.331
He was working so hard on The Crazy Ones at that time,

16:40.364 --> 16:42.734
and it was getting more and more difficult for him

16:42.767 --> 16:44.102
to remember his lines,

16:44.134 --> 16:47.471
and he was getting more and more insecure about his performance.

16:47.504 --> 16:49.072
Mark!

16:49.106 --> 16:51.809
I know that he was sometimes having trouble with his lines,

16:51.843 --> 16:53.277
and stuff up front,

16:53.311 --> 16:58.150
but he was really always able to power through and be that guy.

16:58.182 --> 16:59.884
And once you hit editorial,

16:59.917 --> 17:04.522
you'd find the Robin Williams that you know and love was always there.

17:04.555 --> 17:07.458
I proposed we redo that 1972 spot,

17:07.492 --> 17:09.359
and take a chance of making people feel.

17:09.394 --> 17:12.797
For my projects, we... we really stick to the script,

17:12.829 --> 17:15.900
but when you have Robin Williams,

17:15.934 --> 17:19.936
it would be folly not to let him do whatever he wants to do.

17:19.971 --> 17:21.573
- And take. - Boss.

17:21.606 --> 17:23.808
Secret sauce.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.944
♪ Drive through lovin'

17:25.976 --> 17:27.711
♪ Drive Drive through lovin' ♪

17:27.743 --> 17:29.548
Booty shake, booty shake, booty shake, booty shake.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.349
You didn't give me enough ketchup...

17:31.381 --> 17:33.851
- Packets. - Oh, my God.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.520
So every take would be different.

17:35.552 --> 17:38.223
Uh, ad libs and these comic nuggets

17:38.255 --> 17:41.692
would come from Mars or somewhere in Robin's head.

17:41.725 --> 17:45.263
But a lot of them were gold.

17:45.295 --> 17:48.566
So, I think that he was maybe a little slower out of the gate,

17:48.600 --> 17:50.334
but he finished strong.

17:50.368 --> 17:52.503
He'd managed to, kind of, power through it.

17:52.536 --> 17:55.306
He'd get up and he'd become this guy

17:55.340 --> 17:57.576
that you knew, remembered and loved.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.878
- Can you be serious? - Well, maybe for a second.

17:59.910 --> 18:02.446
No, see... Sorry.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.916
It's not easy to do a network television show,

18:04.948 --> 18:07.418
on top of that he had Night at the Museum,

18:07.452 --> 18:10.755
and you know, he's, he's doing double duty.

18:10.788 --> 18:12.991
The third movie, the last movie,

18:13.023 --> 18:15.793
I would say, a month into the shoot,

18:15.827 --> 18:19.330
it was clear to me, it was clear to all of us on that set

18:19.363 --> 18:22.466
that something was going on with Robin.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.737
That's an experience that I've not spoken about,

18:25.770 --> 18:30.275
um, publicly ever.

18:30.308 --> 18:35.647
We saw that Robin was struggling in a way that he hadn't before.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.850
To remember lines, and to combine

18:38.882 --> 18:41.852
the right words with the performance.

18:41.886 --> 18:45.290
You know, when Robin would call me at ten at night, at two in the morning,

18:45.322 --> 18:47.725
at four in the morning saying,

18:47.759 --> 18:51.896
"Is it usable? Is any of this usable? Do I suck? What's going on?"

18:51.928 --> 18:54.265
I would reassure him.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.901
And so I said, "You are still you.

18:56.934 --> 19:01.505
"I know it, the world knows it. You just need to remember that."

19:02.506 --> 19:04.475
My faith in him never left.

19:04.509 --> 19:08.046
But I saw his morale crumbling.

19:08.079 --> 19:13.585
I saw a guy who wasn't himself and he thought that was unforgivable.

19:16.353 --> 19:19.290
Lewy Body Dementia is particularly tragic

19:19.323 --> 19:22.494
in the way that it increases anxiety,

19:22.526 --> 19:25.929
increases self-doubt, causes delusions,

19:25.963 --> 19:29.501
misbeliefs that have never been present in someone.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.936
And imagine how hard that is for someone

19:31.968 --> 19:34.672
who doesn't even realize that they're suffering

19:34.705 --> 19:36.675
from a degenerative disease,

19:36.707 --> 19:39.410
something that is slowly taking away

19:39.444 --> 19:41.812
the function of neurons across the brain.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.419
I think the thing that made Robin most special

19:48.453 --> 19:51.489
about this spectrum of abilities he had,

19:51.522 --> 19:53.792
was the solid guy in the middle.

19:53.824 --> 19:55.426
That's who you are in the middle of all that other stuff.

19:55.459 --> 19:56.927
These things come and go, who are you?

19:57.328 --> 19:58.664
Do you stay you?

19:59.763 --> 20:01.532
You know, what will you become?

20:05.770 --> 20:08.874
We met on the day he arrived in New York City.

20:11.676 --> 20:16.648
I remember really he was different. I could see the beginnings.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.351
Robin and Christopher Reeve came into my third year class

20:20.385 --> 20:22.686
at Julliard as advanced students.

20:22.719 --> 20:25.823
Christopher was my roommate and Robin became very quickly,

20:25.857 --> 20:28.059
my very best friend that I ever had.

20:28.091 --> 20:31.428
Yeah, we're hippies from space and he's an Ivy League preppy.

20:31.462 --> 20:34.799
But I'm telling you, the three of us had some good times.

20:34.831 --> 20:38.736
He wasn't a comedian back then, he was a very serious actor.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.272
I went to New York, and went to Julliard,

20:40.304 --> 20:44.441
which was, you know, classical training, but very much to be a thespian.

20:44.475 --> 20:46.811
For me it was a wonderful thing, number one to be in New York,

20:46.843 --> 20:49.713
the training and also to get that type of training

20:49.746 --> 20:53.150
where you get the combination of classical and the hardcore.

20:53.184 --> 20:55.954
And he was so believable, visually,

20:55.986 --> 20:59.890
but it's the way he used his voice, man, he was amazing.

20:59.924 --> 21:02.860
And it blew the faculty's mind as well as the students.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.596
But he was always funny.

21:04.628 --> 21:06.497
We'd be rehearsing lines, and he would go off,

21:06.531 --> 21:09.734
"My liege, thou a coxcomb, thou knowest not."

21:09.766 --> 21:12.070
And he would make up lines in iambic pentameter,

21:12.102 --> 21:16.941
but of course, you know, R rated lines, X-rated lines. It was hilarious.

21:17.908 --> 21:19.910
It was hard for him

21:19.944 --> 21:24.416
because there was a lot of politics going on at Julliard in that time.

21:24.448 --> 21:27.418
He left at the two-thirds of the way through that year.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.890
I would go back to San Francisco,

21:32.924 --> 21:35.093
and try and find acting work,

21:35.126 --> 21:37.061
and then took up stand-up comedy as a...

21:37.093 --> 21:39.797
- Right. - 'Cause I couldn't find acting work.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.734
The Holy City Zoo was the club house for all the comedians.

21:44.167 --> 21:45.936
If you could get on a set,

21:45.969 --> 21:49.540
when Robin was promising to be there that night,

21:49.573 --> 21:51.810
you were gold. They packed the place.

21:51.842 --> 21:54.678
Ladies and gentlemen, Robin Williams.

21:57.247 --> 22:01.852
He drained every scintilla of laughter out of that crowd.

22:01.886 --> 22:05.590
When he did that crazy stuff he did on stage,

22:05.622 --> 22:08.625
I think it let everybody else say, "Well, heck!" you know.

22:08.658 --> 22:11.929
Told everybody else, "Yes. Crazy stuff is acceptable."

22:11.963 --> 22:13.598
Robin is doing this in the '70s.

22:13.630 --> 22:16.167
I mean ten, 15, 20 years in some cases

22:16.199 --> 22:18.969
before some of this is happening elsewhere.

22:19.003 --> 22:21.473
He even came down to Hollywood and got up on stage

22:21.505 --> 22:22.806
at The Comedy Store and the Improv

22:22.840 --> 22:24.975
and it was like a landmine hit them, yeah.

22:25.009 --> 22:27.178
I am not a tuna.

22:27.211 --> 22:31.082
I am not a tuna. Is anyone here tonight on drugs?

22:31.115 --> 22:33.751
- Yeah! - Okay.

22:33.783 --> 22:37.088
A quick test right now if you are it's okay.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.624
Come here just a sec, dear brother.

22:40.657 --> 22:43.895
The Reverend likes this stuff here.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.964
He was performing at the Comedy Store,

22:45.996 --> 22:47.532
and he was hilarious.

22:47.564 --> 22:50.567
And I just watched him and I walked backstage,

22:50.600 --> 22:53.537
and he was sitting on the steps behind the stage.

22:53.571 --> 22:55.572
I saw him sitting alone.

22:55.606 --> 22:58.109
It seemed so extraordinary to watch a guy

22:58.141 --> 23:00.143
completely demolish an audience,

23:00.176 --> 23:04.215
and then seem so distanced from what he had just done.

23:04.247 --> 23:08.051
No celebration, just, like, exhausted

23:08.084 --> 23:10.054
from pouring out so much energy.

23:17.227 --> 23:18.629
I got a phone call.

23:19.763 --> 23:21.599
It was Robin.

23:21.631 --> 23:26.070
He was up in Vancouver and he was working on Night at the Museum 3,

23:26.102 --> 23:28.872
and he was... he was having a panic attack,

23:28.906 --> 23:31.676
and he could not calm himself down.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.777
He's having such a struggle...

23:35.745 --> 23:37.247
remembering just one line.

23:37.281 --> 23:40.918
- Your life depended on me. - Say that. It wasn't enough that you took a...

23:40.952 --> 23:42.587
He got very frustrated.

23:42.619 --> 23:46.991
I remember him saying to me, "I'm not me anymore.

23:47.023 --> 23:49.694
"I don't know what's going on. I'm not me anymore."

23:49.726 --> 23:53.931
His mind was not firing at the same speed.

23:53.965 --> 23:58.669
That spark was diminished.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.973
Uh, the joy was sometimes not there.

24:04.074 --> 24:06.544
I had to work harder editorially,

24:07.111 --> 24:09.046
to create it on screen

24:09.080 --> 24:11.883
because it wasn't always there in the same way on set.

24:11.916 --> 24:13.083
And I didn't resent that,

24:13.117 --> 24:16.788
it was more taxing, it took a lot more time and energy,

24:16.821 --> 24:18.356
but if that's what my guy needed,

24:18.388 --> 24:19.991
then that's what I was gonna give my guy.

24:23.293 --> 24:26.330
The one thing that did bother me was the arm.

24:26.363 --> 24:31.268
I'd frequently see him clutching his hand close to his chest a little bit,

24:31.301 --> 24:34.973
or he'd put it in his pocket and kind of mask certain things.

24:35.906 --> 24:37.809
We knew that he was fragile,

24:37.841 --> 24:42.714
and the deal was sometimes we had to let Robin be alone,

24:42.746 --> 24:45.048
take a minute, catch his breath,

24:45.081 --> 24:48.252
particularly at the end of shooting.

24:48.284 --> 24:51.723
Uh, the last time I was with him, I was on set.

24:51.755 --> 24:56.226
We were doing, shooting a, uh, scene in a church,

24:56.260 --> 24:58.296
it was called Glory of Love.

24:58.329 --> 25:01.832
Thought I saw the box move!

25:01.866 --> 25:06.371
And we had a room for him where he could, uh, go between takes,

25:06.404 --> 25:09.340
and I went into that room,

25:09.372 --> 25:12.275
we talked a little bit about the scene,

25:12.309 --> 25:17.348
and, um, he asked a few times, um,

25:17.380 --> 25:19.883
"How's it going? Is it working?"

25:19.917 --> 25:24.722
Um, but the subtext of it was, "How am I doing? Am I working?"

25:24.754 --> 25:28.225
His sense of security and confidence,

25:28.259 --> 25:30.228
and who he was and what he was,

25:30.261 --> 25:32.930
it was something eroding within him.

25:32.963 --> 25:34.298
We didn't know why.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.167
- You know, you got to give a little. - Yeah.

25:36.199 --> 25:37.801
'Cause we knew he was getting tested.

25:37.834 --> 25:41.872
He was feeling, um, infirm, or not himself,

25:41.906 --> 25:44.175
and he was getting tested, and I think

25:44.207 --> 25:48.178
that those tests included brain scans and nothing was showing up.

25:49.346 --> 25:52.784
It wasn't like he's my son, and I can say,

25:52.817 --> 25:55.019
"All right, timeout.

25:55.051 --> 25:58.790
"I'm going to pull you out of this because you're getting sick,

25:58.822 --> 26:01.458
"and you need some rest. And I don't care what the teachers say."

26:01.492 --> 26:03.327
No no no.

26:03.359 --> 26:05.830
He's signed up. These are contracts you don't break.

26:05.862 --> 26:07.364
This is this, this and the other thing. There's...

26:09.300 --> 26:11.202
What can I do?

26:11.234 --> 26:14.205
And Robin, he aimed to please every day,

26:14.237 --> 26:16.039
every minute, he aimed to please.

26:16.072 --> 26:18.775
If the studio or the network came begging

26:18.809 --> 26:24.081
for more interviews and more publicity, he would always give it his all.

26:24.115 --> 26:29.287
His intellect and his mental acumen were so beyond ours

26:29.320 --> 26:32.889
that it could be compromised a great deal probably,

26:32.923 --> 26:36.928
and he would still be playing a step ahead of the rest of us.

26:36.961 --> 26:41.199
- How much of the script in the show is you... - 23.5% improv.

26:41.232 --> 26:43.468
- Good. That's exactly what I wanted... - 23.5.

26:43.501 --> 26:45.802
- She hasn't finished the question here, Robin. - But I knew where she was going.

26:45.836 --> 26:50.341
- Oh, okay. - You dancing? There's one dance number and it's a ballet.

26:51.475 --> 26:55.346
So Lewy Body Dementia, like all degenerative diseases

26:55.378 --> 26:58.949
is a problem of plumbing and circuitry.

26:58.983 --> 27:01.351
These degenerative diseases are caused

27:01.385 --> 27:04.955
by misfolding of proteins within neurons,

27:04.988 --> 27:08.992
or the parts of the brain that allow us to move, think and feel.

27:10.927 --> 27:13.430
We have 70 billion neurons.

27:13.464 --> 27:16.501
They slowly disintegrate.

27:16.533 --> 27:21.238
This bad protein alpha-synuclein relentlessly picks off neurons

27:21.272 --> 27:25.376
in a specific neighborhood, spreading through that neighborhood,

27:25.408 --> 27:29.781
and then moves into different neighborhoods in the brain.

27:29.813 --> 27:33.383
And then finally it's swept across the entire brainstem,

27:33.417 --> 27:36.821
almost every neuron in that circuit

27:36.853 --> 27:42.125
with sleep, mood, anxiety, cognition has been affected,

27:42.158 --> 27:46.129
and that is really the late stage of dementia with Lewy Bodies.

27:46.163 --> 27:49.067
The stage that no one can get out of.

27:58.509 --> 28:01.579
Soldiers have very refined bull detectors,

28:01.611 --> 28:05.015
and to see that instantaneous connection

28:05.049 --> 28:06.885
that Robin was able to make.

28:09.186 --> 28:12.356
Good evening, Baghdad!

28:12.388 --> 28:13.357
Thank you.

28:13.389 --> 28:17.561
What he understood about the American soldier

28:17.594 --> 28:20.864
was where they came from.

28:20.898 --> 28:23.600
Some of these kids are dying, they're getting wounded.

28:23.634 --> 28:26.437
He had a way of connecting with them

28:26.469 --> 28:29.373
that just made them feel so good.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.442
He was there for them,

28:32.475 --> 28:34.878
and they understood that.

28:34.911 --> 28:38.148
There's combat, hardcore stuff and then it's a lot of waiting around,

28:38.182 --> 28:40.117
and it's that stuff where people need

28:40.149 --> 28:42.919
things just to fight the boredom, and that is most important.

28:42.953 --> 28:47.157
And I think most people are just shocked that someone showed up. Like, "Why are you here man?"

28:50.526 --> 28:53.864
Afghanistan, six times, Iraq, five. Yeah, it's crazy.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.434
And you haven't fixed it yet. That's disappointing

28:56.466 --> 28:58.535
You know, from going there, that's the best audiences in the world.

29:04.174 --> 29:06.109
I do have a story.

29:06.142 --> 29:08.412
I've... I've got a ton of them.

29:10.546 --> 29:13.416
A young man was very seriously injured,

29:13.449 --> 29:17.254
and his girlfriend had decided it was just a little bit

29:17.288 --> 29:18.656
too much for her to handle,

29:18.688 --> 29:22.560
and she had just left and she was not coming back.

29:22.592 --> 29:26.096
She was on her way to the airport.

29:26.129 --> 29:32.203
So we walked in and you could tell that he was in, um, in despair.

29:32.235 --> 29:36.206
And how afraid that he was, in going forward,

29:36.240 --> 29:38.643
that he would never have another girlfriend,

29:38.676 --> 29:42.280
you know, about what his life was going to be like.

29:42.312 --> 29:47.484
And, um, Robin pulled up his chair right beside his bed

29:47.517 --> 29:50.921
and started talking about fear.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.357
He went into some very personal things.

29:53.389 --> 29:56.026
I think we probably stayed an hour and a half.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.596
And, you know, we walked out,

29:58.628 --> 30:02.433
and, um, Robin actually said,

30:02.465 --> 30:04.368
"Boy, that was a tough one."

30:04.400 --> 30:09.039
He said, "Because for all of us, confronting our fears

30:09.072 --> 30:11.708
"is a very difficult thing to do."

30:11.742 --> 30:15.280
And he said, "I'm sure nobody ever thinks I'm afraid of anything."

30:17.380 --> 30:21.118
That was a big topic of conversation.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.486
Was their spouse going to stay with them?

30:23.520 --> 30:26.991
Were people going to be looking at them differently?

30:27.023 --> 30:29.627
He actually talked about those kinds of things.

30:29.659 --> 30:34.298
He was willing to sit and talk about some of his own fears.

30:36.734 --> 30:40.571
And, um, I'll never forget one day and he said,

30:40.603 --> 30:42.305
"Oh, Elaine, that was a tough one."

30:42.339 --> 30:44.642
And he said, "He doesn't know that,

30:44.675 --> 30:49.213
"but I have been so close to what he was talking about myself."

31:00.057 --> 31:02.493
It was early May and he came home,

31:02.525 --> 31:07.330
and it was like a plane coming in with no landing gear.

31:07.363 --> 31:12.369
His resources were just... spent.

31:12.403 --> 31:15.606
We were supposed to go to some friends and, um,

31:15.638 --> 31:18.443
Robin couldn't, he couldn't get out of bed.

31:20.711 --> 31:24.181
It was becoming more of a normal that,

31:24.214 --> 31:25.416
"Robin is not feeling well.

31:27.350 --> 31:30.654
"And I can't tell you why.

31:30.686 --> 31:32.255
"We're just gonna stay home."

31:32.789 --> 31:34.993
His delusional looping

31:36.260 --> 31:37.996
would just kick in at night.

31:39.629 --> 31:43.633
We'd gone to a birthday party, um, our dear, dear friend, Mort Sahl.

31:45.269 --> 31:47.138
That night,

31:47.170 --> 31:50.273
Robin was up, and he started talking about,

31:50.307 --> 31:54.245
he was so afraid that Mort was not going to make it through the night.

31:55.745 --> 31:58.349
You know, so we started to have this discussion again.

31:58.381 --> 31:59.716
It's like 12, one o'clock at night,

31:59.750 --> 32:02.053
and it goes to like 3:30 in the morning.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.388
And I mean, it goes, we're covering all the bases

32:04.420 --> 32:08.491
because he's convinced that he should go to Mort's house right now,

32:08.524 --> 32:09.761
and make sure he's okay.

32:11.794 --> 32:14.164
That night he was texting Mort, like,

32:14.197 --> 32:17.667
"Are you okay? Are you okay?" And Mort's asleep, most likely, you know.

32:17.701 --> 32:20.704
And so because he wasn't getting a response from Mort

32:20.736 --> 32:23.474
at two o'clock in the morning, he wanted to go there.

32:25.641 --> 32:29.112
So this was a typical night for us.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.249
There is something wrong.

32:33.282 --> 32:35.586
There is something not right here.

32:40.189 --> 32:42.526
And he said, "I just want to reboot my brain.

32:43.726 --> 32:45.595
"I just want to reboot my brain."

32:52.769 --> 32:55.573
We started to see some physical things happening to him,

32:55.606 --> 32:58.509
and he was trying to hide it with his arm and things like that.

32:58.542 --> 32:59.644
So we started to see it.

33:01.044 --> 33:04.414
One point, he came up and he was in a tee shirt.

33:04.447 --> 33:06.783
His ribs were actually showing.

33:06.817 --> 33:11.289
I grabbed his skin. "Robin, you're really getting thin."

33:12.688 --> 33:15.658
He said, "Yeah, boss, I've gone to the doctor,

33:15.692 --> 33:18.561
"but I don't know what it is."

33:18.594 --> 33:20.630
When he came to a party, and we were all there,

33:20.664 --> 33:24.602
the comedians were, they were flummoxed,

33:24.635 --> 33:27.204
they were overwhelmed.

33:27.236 --> 33:31.641
And he was off lurking in the corners alone.

33:31.675 --> 33:34.177
I mean, can you imagine, you're at a party and you're, "Where's Robin?"

33:34.211 --> 33:37.481
And you look and he's over in the corner fiddling around with a bush,

33:37.513 --> 33:40.184
or something like, well, this is not good.

33:41.517 --> 33:45.155
He was suffering and you could tell it.

33:45.188 --> 33:48.359
I tried to get him to go to a James Taylor concert with us,

33:48.391 --> 33:49.893
and he says, "I don't think I can."

33:49.926 --> 33:52.396
I go, "I mean, I know you're tired, but I'll drive and I'll come get you.

33:52.428 --> 33:53.898
"And we have the tickets and it's on me."

33:53.930 --> 33:56.199
And he goes, "No, I don't think I can leave the house."

33:56.233 --> 33:59.637
And that kind of, scared me a little bit, you know,

33:59.669 --> 34:03.206
'cause he was serious and I go, "Okay."

34:03.240 --> 34:06.911
And I didn't really press him on it, but I mean, he was leveling with me

34:06.944 --> 34:08.779
that "I don't think I could leave my house right now."

34:10.214 --> 34:11.949
And his speech patterns changed a little bit

34:11.982 --> 34:14.485
that I don't know how to... It's hard for me to talk about it.

34:14.518 --> 34:15.985
I knew there was something going on.

34:16.020 --> 34:19.757
I spoke with Robin almost every day or text and stuff,

34:19.790 --> 34:22.326
I witnessed his processing reality

34:22.359 --> 34:25.696
completely different than the way everybody else.

34:25.728 --> 34:27.598
And it just, the only reason I talk about that

34:27.630 --> 34:31.668
is his brain was giving him misinformation.

34:31.701 --> 34:33.270
Complete misinformation.

34:41.511 --> 34:45.917
Going from where Robin and I had our world together,

34:46.484 --> 34:49.386
that was our sanctuary.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.688
Oh, it's so lovely to see that you're so happy and everything.

34:51.721 --> 34:52.924
How did the two of you meet?

34:54.891 --> 34:57.461
Seriously, outside an Apple store.

34:58.929 --> 35:00.397
It was a busy Saturday.

35:00.431 --> 35:04.335
I had to go to the Apple store, and I start heading to the back,

35:04.368 --> 35:07.670
and I see this man dressed in camo.

35:07.703 --> 35:11.641
He was just smiling at me and I thought, "I think that's Robin Williams."

35:14.710 --> 35:17.214
And I thought, "All right, I'm just gonna go and say hi."

35:20.016 --> 35:23.419
I had camo pants on and she said, "How's that camo working for you?"

35:23.453 --> 35:25.788
"Really good, obviously, you saw it."

35:25.822 --> 35:29.893
We just started talking and we had the connection of 12 step stuff.

35:29.926 --> 35:34.697
You know, we both had crazy drug and alcohol days earlier in our lives.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.267
He knew enough information to be able to find me,

35:37.301 --> 35:39.904
if he wanted to, you know, I'm one of the regular 12 step meetings.

35:40.871 --> 35:42.740
The next Tuesday night,

35:42.772 --> 35:45.742
I was at my regular thing.

35:45.775 --> 35:47.777
I looked around the room, I didn't see him. I thought, "Oh, well."

35:47.810 --> 35:50.780
Midway through the meeting I turned around,

35:50.813 --> 35:53.917
and, uh, there he... there he was in the back of the room.

35:53.949 --> 35:56.986
Then I turned around real quick and thought, "Oh my God, he's here."

35:57.020 --> 35:59.523
Well, it was, kind of sweet and then I was like off and running.

35:59.556 --> 36:00.657
It was wonderful.

36:00.690 --> 36:04.895
He told me he met this girl, and she knocked him out.

36:04.927 --> 36:06.663
Well, he told me he was in love.

36:06.697 --> 36:09.367
You know, men don't usually say that to each other.

36:30.554 --> 36:34.391
My partner in crime who we've been walking clean and sober together,

36:34.424 --> 36:39.996
and enjoying all the rawness and authenticity of life together.

36:40.029 --> 36:42.765
Like here. This is Susan and Robin and it was great you know.

36:42.799 --> 36:47.003
It was like a, "I'm going to raise up. Let me lift myself up to love."

36:54.511 --> 37:00.351
We just had a theme, a way of approaching life that was so in sync.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.886
We just were like two little kids.

37:06.857 --> 37:10.127
We were looking at the world together,

37:10.159 --> 37:13.029
you know, almost like through each other's eyes.

37:14.831 --> 37:16.734
That was like having a best friend, you know,

37:16.766 --> 37:18.768
where you could really explore life together.

37:26.509 --> 37:28.378
Yeah, we dated for about four years.

37:28.411 --> 37:32.616
We'd had promise rings that we'd worn for a year already.

37:32.648 --> 37:36.453
Doesn't everybody do promise rings? I don't know.

37:36.485 --> 37:38.054
We knew we wanted to get married.

37:42.859 --> 37:45.529
October 22nd, 2011,

37:46.163 --> 37:47.665
it was storybook.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.402
Wow. I'm just picturing him. Um...

37:51.435 --> 37:52.603
He sure looked good.

37:56.473 --> 37:59.844
A part of my wedding vows was really all about...

38:00.777 --> 38:03.080
loving him as he is.

38:03.112 --> 38:05.382
I've no desire to change this man.

38:08.784 --> 38:10.487
And you had your honeymoon in Paris?

38:10.520 --> 38:11.822
- Oh, it was wonderful. - Yeah?

38:11.855 --> 38:13.956
The great thing is in Paris, all the paparazzi

38:13.989 --> 38:15.090
are like wildlife photographers.

38:15.125 --> 38:18.195
Obviously you look over there like, Robin, kiss her.

38:18.228 --> 38:20.030
Lift up her skirt. No, get away from me.

38:20.063 --> 38:22.566
Kiss her, kiss her, do it now.

38:22.598 --> 38:25.535
The comedian will now attempt to kiss the tall woman.

38:32.241 --> 38:34.644
He had come home from

38:34.677 --> 38:36.712
A Night at the Museum.

38:36.746 --> 38:37.948
He was basically home for a week.

38:38.982 --> 38:41.819
He was absolutely exhausted.

38:41.851 --> 38:43.987
We were looking at a week of testing.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.656
The calendar was just booked.

38:45.688 --> 38:47.924
So, we had this day at the beginning of it all.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.059
I said, you know, "Why don't we go out

38:49.092 --> 38:51.928
"to Tennessee Valley, go on a walkabout there,"

38:51.962 --> 38:54.498
which we loved. We just loved our walks.

38:54.531 --> 38:55.431
This is when I realized

38:55.465 --> 38:57.801
my honey had never ever been on a picnic.

38:59.235 --> 39:01.638
It was a pretty windy day.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.674
But as we got out there, there weren't a lot of people

39:03.706 --> 39:04.708
and, um,

39:05.775 --> 39:07.211
it was so nice

39:07.243 --> 39:09.012
to have space around us

39:09.645 --> 39:10.680
in nature.

39:10.714 --> 39:12.850
We went over to the rocks and, um,

39:13.683 --> 39:15.752
ate our sandwiches and it was just us

39:15.784 --> 39:18.087
and it was peaceful.

39:18.121 --> 39:20.891
It was one of those moments in the midst of this

39:20.924 --> 39:22.826
frenzy of trying to find out what's going on.

39:22.859 --> 39:24.761
Like the drum beat was getting more and more.

39:26.196 --> 39:28.197
And he was depleted.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.566
He was so...

39:30.634 --> 39:31.836
so depleted.

39:32.268 --> 39:34.036
And, uh...

39:34.069 --> 39:36.172
he just put his head down in my lap,

39:36.206 --> 39:38.742
you know, and I just, I just stroked his hair and...

39:40.777 --> 39:42.713
He just laid in my lap for like,

39:42.746 --> 39:43.747
couple hours.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.549
Well, the guy was tired.

39:53.656 --> 39:55.959
So, the first time that Robin came into my shop,

39:56.993 --> 39:58.728
it was in 1983

39:58.761 --> 40:01.898
and it was shortly after John Belushi died.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.768
When John Belushi passed away...

40:07.871 --> 40:10.107
it devastated Robin.

40:10.139 --> 40:12.109
John was crazier than anybody,

40:12.141 --> 40:13.877
and, but man, did he pay the price

40:13.909 --> 40:15.212
and, and, you know,

40:15.244 --> 40:17.982
it hit him like a sheet of cold ice.

40:19.014 --> 40:21.150
He pulled out of a dive.

40:21.183 --> 40:22.919
He stopped everything,

40:22.953 --> 40:24.888
but white wine for one year

40:24.920 --> 40:26.022
and he didn't go to AA.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.292
And I mean, "Wow how are you doing this?"

40:28.324 --> 40:30.726
And he goes, "Just because I have to," you know.

40:30.759 --> 40:31.761
He didn't want to die.

40:31.795 --> 40:33.730
Then of course, he'd always been

40:33.763 --> 40:35.632
really physical, you know, he was an athlete,

40:35.665 --> 40:36.967
he was a good athlete.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.902
He took up cycling.

40:38.935 --> 40:40.637
And he started riding more and more

40:40.670 --> 40:42.106
and we started seeing him more and more.

40:42.672 --> 40:45.042
You are a keen cyclist?

40:45.074 --> 40:46.342
Yes, sir. I am a bike sexual.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.844
Yes, sir. I like to ride the bike.

40:49.145 --> 40:50.980
I mean for me, it's my meditation.

40:51.014 --> 40:52.883
It's what I do. I can, uh,

40:52.915 --> 40:53.984
get on my bike and ride about,

40:54.016 --> 40:56.619
sometimes 20 miles, sometimes 40, or 50 miles

40:56.652 --> 40:57.754
and it's great. It's beautiful.

40:59.154 --> 41:00.223
He said that,

41:00.255 --> 41:02.960
you know, cycling was the closest thing to flying

41:03.860 --> 41:05.862
and it allowed him

41:05.895 --> 41:06.929
to free himself

41:06.962 --> 41:09.265
from all the things that went on in his mind

41:09.299 --> 41:11.601
because his mind was so active, right?

41:12.802 --> 41:15.105
Robin and running and biking

41:15.138 --> 41:16.840
was always in struggle.

41:16.873 --> 41:18.175
You know, you have to push yourself,

41:18.208 --> 41:19.243
you have to challenge yourself.

41:20.743 --> 41:22.378
And Robin as an artist,

41:22.411 --> 41:25.047
challenged himself to do roles

41:25.081 --> 41:26.350
that were like,

41:27.217 --> 41:28.952
stretching himself.

41:28.985 --> 41:31.888
He wanted to prove that he wasn't just a comedic actor,

41:31.920 --> 41:32.922
he was an actor.

41:32.956 --> 41:34.324
When you're improvising, you're going out looking.

41:34.357 --> 41:36.994
I'd be going and talking to flowers and how are you doing? Please cough.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.396
You know, when you're playing like that, you're going out.

41:39.429 --> 41:42.065
But by stopping that, you force the energy to implode

41:42.098 --> 41:44.266
and you find, you can explore yourself.

41:44.299 --> 41:46.603
Either memories or different emotions.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.040
Oh, Captain, my captain.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.141
Sit down, Mister...

41:51.174 --> 41:53.342
Dead Poets Society almost didn't happen

41:53.375 --> 41:55.711
because they really just wanted him to do it.

41:55.744 --> 41:56.980
The writer asked me...

41:57.980 --> 41:59.683
"How could we get Robin

41:59.715 --> 42:01.317
"to reconsider this and maybe do this?"

42:01.351 --> 42:03.720
I said, "Well, you need to involve him

42:03.752 --> 42:04.955
"in the creative process

42:04.987 --> 42:07.190
"and at least give him a voice

42:07.223 --> 42:09.359
"in choosing the director."

42:09.391 --> 42:10.926
I said, "Make him a short list."

42:10.960 --> 42:12.795
But Peter Weir was at the top of it

42:12.828 --> 42:14.897
and he said, "I'm in, if you can get Peter Weir."

42:15.699 --> 42:16.700
And it happened.

42:18.467 --> 42:20.002
Thank you, boys.

42:20.036 --> 42:21.938
Yeah, he gave me a sweet gift and, um,

42:21.971 --> 42:23.239
and I mean...

42:23.272 --> 42:24.907
When he's looking at the yearbook

42:24.940 --> 42:26.676
from when he was a student.

42:26.710 --> 42:29.012
Gentlemen.

42:29.045 --> 42:30.848
We were just looking in your old annual.

42:32.348 --> 42:34.317
Oh, my God.

42:34.350 --> 42:35.985
- Then the kids... - No, it's not...

42:36.018 --> 42:37.053
...show him this yearbook.

42:37.087 --> 42:38.722
He gets down on his knees and just...

42:38.755 --> 42:40.190
No, it's not me.

42:40.223 --> 42:42.292
Stanley "the toll" Wilson.

42:42.324 --> 42:44.226
Stanley "the tool" Wilson.

42:44.259 --> 42:45.428
Which was his nickname for me.

42:49.065 --> 42:50.701
What was the dead poets society?

42:52.402 --> 42:53.904
So, I'm sitting with him at the premiere

42:53.936 --> 42:54.938
next to the heads of Disney

42:54.971 --> 42:57.139
and he was smiling and he wouldn't look at me.

42:57.172 --> 42:59.475
But I started crying when this came on

42:59.509 --> 43:02.244
and that was his thank you to me for helping.

43:02.277 --> 43:04.013
And he was brilliant.

43:04.047 --> 43:06.150
Invincible just like you feel.

43:07.116 --> 43:08.217
The world is their oyster.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.221
He always wanted to push himself. He did.

43:11.253 --> 43:13.223
And I think that's incredibly admirable

43:13.255 --> 43:15.192
because you don't have to do that.

43:15.225 --> 43:16.460
When you're wealthy and famous

43:16.493 --> 43:18.295
and people, the world over love you

43:18.328 --> 43:19.763
and want you to make them laugh.

43:29.139 --> 43:31.274
We liked to go play basketball

43:31.306 --> 43:32.341
with a local group

43:32.375 --> 43:35.779
that helps develop mentally disabled adults.

43:38.380 --> 43:41.484
His neurologist, who also attends that,

43:41.518 --> 43:44.920
had, um, not seen him since December,

43:44.953 --> 43:48.859
when the suspicion about his, uh...

43:48.891 --> 43:51.393
the shaking of his hand was, you know it was...

43:51.427 --> 43:52.895
keep an eye on it, but at that point

43:52.929 --> 43:56.066
it was so minimal maybe it's because of this previous shoulder injury.

43:57.433 --> 43:59.902
Well, basically that night, um,

43:59.935 --> 44:01.971
that doctor made a visual diagnosis

44:02.005 --> 44:03.207
from way across court.

44:11.447 --> 44:14.084
All he knew was that we were going to be going in to see the GP.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.087
When he was told he had Parkinson's...

44:22.225 --> 44:23.860
and they're saying it's early to mild

44:23.893 --> 44:25.427
and, you know, that's great.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.163
So, okay, we get on medications,

44:27.197 --> 44:30.233
we'll figure this out, you know, you'll get it adjusted.

44:30.266 --> 44:32.369
They were saying ten good years.

44:32.402 --> 44:34.170
I could see he wasn't buying it.

44:35.103 --> 44:36.339
Robin got to ask

44:37.172 --> 44:38.507
these questions, um,

44:38.540 --> 44:40.243
which at the time seems like...

44:41.578 --> 44:42.780
you know...

44:44.514 --> 44:47.884
He asked, "Am I, um...

44:47.917 --> 44:49.853
"Do I have Alzheimer's?

44:49.886 --> 44:51.087
"Do I have dementia?

44:51.119 --> 44:52.188
"Am I schizophrenic?"

44:56.326 --> 44:58.362
And the answers were, no, no and no.

45:01.029 --> 45:03.065
The real depth of these symptoms,

45:03.098 --> 45:05.000
he only knew,

45:05.034 --> 45:06.970
the rest of us were working with what we could.

45:08.638 --> 45:12.141
In Robin's case, there was a focus on his movement.

45:12.174 --> 45:14.109
But I think internally for Robin,

45:14.143 --> 45:16.012
this was only a tiny part

45:16.045 --> 45:19.449
of the symptoms that he was experiencing.

45:19.482 --> 45:22.018
Another very early feature of dementia

45:22.051 --> 45:25.522
with Lewy Bodies is visual hallucinations.

45:25.554 --> 45:27.890
They often believe that these

45:27.924 --> 45:30.293
hallucinations are real.

45:30.326 --> 45:33.263
So, for Robin learning that he had Parkinson's disease

45:33.295 --> 45:34.297
was not enough.

45:40.435 --> 45:41.571
He's an old friend of mine

45:41.603 --> 45:44.174
and a former classmate at Julliard School in New York,

45:44.206 --> 45:45.208
Robin Williams.

45:48.344 --> 45:50.380
- You gotta keep that. Here you go. - Looky there!

45:51.281 --> 45:52.516
Or is somebody's fantasy.

45:57.987 --> 46:00.557
Robin and Christopher were very good friends.

46:00.589 --> 46:02.892
Christopher was a preppy from New England, and that was our

46:03.560 --> 46:05.561
slightly younger brother.

46:05.594 --> 46:07.997
And the three of us were, you know, brother Williams,

46:08.031 --> 46:09.333
brother Wilson and brother Reeve.

46:15.270 --> 46:18.173
Christopher, we went to see him when he first had this accident.

46:18.206 --> 46:20.576
He just had the accident and...

46:20.610 --> 46:23.213
there were people making decisions whether or not to keep him,

46:23.246 --> 46:24.547
you know, on life support.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.282
Robin went in disguised as a doctor

46:26.315 --> 46:28.118
in the emergency room.

46:28.150 --> 46:30.920
I said, I was a Russian proctologist

46:30.953 --> 46:32.621
and most of the other doctors, "Oh, no."

46:32.654 --> 46:35.090
and he looked up at me going, "Hey, brother, what's up?"

46:35.123 --> 46:36.659
And I said, "Would you mind, I'm just going to do a brief exam,

46:36.692 --> 46:39.662
"like what you said if you feel two fingers, it's your luck."

46:41.563 --> 46:43.098
You know, and he laughed

46:43.132 --> 46:44.501
and he said, "Hey, brother, what's happening?"

46:44.534 --> 46:47.337
And it was that idea of even in the face of that.

46:47.369 --> 46:49.038
And it helped. I mean, he,

46:49.072 --> 46:50.474
you know, he's an extraordinary guy.

46:52.141 --> 46:56.145
First one to show up down in Virginia when I was really in trouble.

46:56.179 --> 46:58.648
He came here to Kessler one afternoon and just...

47:01.551 --> 47:03.420
Thank God I wear a seatbelt on this chair

47:03.453 --> 47:05.121
because I would have fallen out laughing.

47:08.257 --> 47:11.194
When Christopher, we went to see him when he first had this accident,

47:11.226 --> 47:14.431
we both talked and said, "I never knew he was strong,"

47:14.464 --> 47:16.299
and Robin didn't either. And he says,

47:16.331 --> 47:19.234
"I don't think I could go through that"

47:19.268 --> 47:21.103
"and I wouldn't want to," you know.

47:26.542 --> 47:28.210
He looked very frail

47:28.243 --> 47:31.113
when he came back from the museum picture.

47:31.147 --> 47:33.183
He used to come over like, every afternoon.

47:34.449 --> 47:36.453
He'd sit in the chair right at the corner.

47:38.186 --> 47:40.257
He'd mumble along

47:40.790 --> 47:42.225
about it but...

47:43.759 --> 47:46.362
he never described the severity to me

47:47.362 --> 47:49.264
of losing everything.

47:49.297 --> 47:51.467
I'd trick him even when he got depressed,

47:52.534 --> 47:54.636
I'd say, "Well, a lot of times

47:54.670 --> 47:56.172
"I want to jump off the roof."

47:56.205 --> 47:57.340
"Really?" He'd say.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.676
But I said, "Yeah."

48:01.411 --> 48:03.647
I said, "You can't jump off the roof because...

48:06.315 --> 48:08.451
"you can't leave Susan alone."

48:08.484 --> 48:11.520
And as soon as I got anywhere near saying that and he would go,

48:11.554 --> 48:13.290
"Ooh. Ooh."

48:13.857 --> 48:16.159
Admiration all the time,

48:16.192 --> 48:18.594
that's the thing he kept getting

48:18.627 --> 48:21.196
over to me all the time and saying,

48:21.230 --> 48:22.599
"Now, I finally got it right."

48:23.665 --> 48:25.768
So, he saw a tremendous irony...

48:28.670 --> 48:30.239
in getting sick.

48:32.607 --> 48:34.744
He had these introspective moments.

48:36.746 --> 48:38.315
And a lot of depression

48:39.348 --> 48:40.384
as it approached,

48:43.152 --> 48:45.388
but he didn't verbalize that to me

48:45.420 --> 48:46.489
and, uh...

48:49.558 --> 48:51.093
he just wasn't laughing a lot.

48:55.163 --> 48:58.634
People believe that there is psychology

48:58.668 --> 49:00.603
and then there's neuroscience

49:00.636 --> 49:02.304
and they're not the same.

49:02.337 --> 49:04.273
But in fact it's all related

49:04.306 --> 49:06.176
to how our brain circuits are working.

49:07.610 --> 49:10.547
This is very hard for our society to understanding and grapple with

49:10.580 --> 49:12.715
because we have a different way of thinking

49:12.748 --> 49:14.384
about psychiatric disease.

49:14.417 --> 49:16.319
There's not a realization

49:16.351 --> 49:18.687
that the chemical changes in the brain

49:18.721 --> 49:22.391
are responsible for the psychiatric symptoms.

49:22.424 --> 49:25.661
Lewy Body Disease, it is brain circuits

49:25.694 --> 49:27.397
that cause troubles

49:27.429 --> 49:30.699
that people assume are, you know, behavioral,

49:30.732 --> 49:33.168
not potentially related to a disease.

49:33.201 --> 49:35.772
Someone has Parkinson's disease and they have shaking

49:35.804 --> 49:37.306
and they can't walk.

49:37.339 --> 49:39.775
Then, oh, that's clearly a disease.

49:39.808 --> 49:42.478
But in fact it's pure semantics.

49:42.511 --> 49:43.546
There's no difference.

49:43.580 --> 49:46.482
It's just different circuits are being affected.

49:46.516 --> 49:49.385
It flows over someone like a massive wave,

49:49.418 --> 49:51.421
no matter how moral,

49:51.453 --> 49:53.222
ethical, good,

49:53.255 --> 49:55.190
brilliant someone is.

49:55.223 --> 49:57.192
When they get, you know, disease

49:57.226 --> 49:59.863
of the magnitude of dementia with Lewy Bodies,

49:59.895 --> 50:01.363
they get very sick

50:01.397 --> 50:04.201
and they change enormously in a psychiatric way.

50:05.668 --> 50:07.403
It affects sleep very early.

50:07.435 --> 50:11.573
This is another very hard part of Lewy Body Disease.

50:11.607 --> 50:14.543
When they're asleep, they suddenly act out their dreams,

50:14.576 --> 50:17.147
we call REM behavior.

50:17.179 --> 50:18.815
They can strike out during a dream

50:18.848 --> 50:20.550
and actually hit people at night.

50:21.884 --> 50:24.320
The lack of sleep had been building

50:24.353 --> 50:27.490
very intensely since December.

50:27.522 --> 50:28.790
He's thrashing at night now,

50:28.824 --> 50:30.827
which is a Parkinsonian type symptom.

50:31.761 --> 50:33.096
So, now,

50:33.128 --> 50:35.464
what was happening, you know when you first fall asleep,

50:35.498 --> 50:37.833
like, you start to go deep pretty quick if you're tired?

50:37.866 --> 50:39.635
He would go,

50:39.668 --> 50:41.203
"Honey, what did you think about..."

50:41.237 --> 50:43.840
Like in a daytime voice, he was loud.

50:45.674 --> 50:47.176
No one was getting sleep.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.846
It was impossible because the delusional looping.

50:51.614 --> 50:54.918
And then the degree to which the paranoia

50:54.951 --> 50:57.621
came in, it was so drastic.

50:58.888 --> 51:00.590
He's just going from room to room,

51:00.623 --> 51:01.925
literally watching me,

51:01.958 --> 51:03.760
he's making a lot of phone calls

51:03.793 --> 51:06.396
and texting people and questioning.

51:06.429 --> 51:08.565
I'm sure. I know it was a lot about questioning

51:09.065 --> 51:11.434
my loyalty to him.

51:14.302 --> 51:16.371
And then I'm like back in the studio

51:16.404 --> 51:17.940
and he's watching me

51:17.973 --> 51:20.809
and he's standing there in a frozen stance.

51:21.944 --> 51:23.446
And he wasn't moving.

51:24.647 --> 51:26.415
And then he'd come out of it

51:26.449 --> 51:28.284
and he was so upset with himself.

51:30.319 --> 51:32.355
There were other scenes going on for him.

51:32.388 --> 51:35.225
There were other ideas about us.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.627
What part of this is...

51:38.527 --> 51:39.529
is freewill?

51:40.596 --> 51:41.931
He had this awareness

51:41.964 --> 51:45.335
of what he was doing and that pained him

51:45.368 --> 51:48.505
because he knew it wasn't us, it wasn't right.

51:51.806 --> 51:53.743
There's that core of that person

51:53.775 --> 51:56.279
that is still completely maintained

51:56.311 --> 51:57.647
and they struggle with this

51:57.679 --> 52:00.015
and they struggle with how they're changing

52:00.049 --> 52:02.518
and, you know, they often don't

52:02.551 --> 52:05.355
have a good logical conclusion about it.

52:05.388 --> 52:06.523
So, it's very hard.

52:13.029 --> 52:16.833
Robin is, um, not getting enough sleep.

52:16.866 --> 52:19.802
The therapists are like, "Not getting sleep can be really dangerous."

52:21.971 --> 52:24.007
When we were told to, um,

52:24.040 --> 52:26.610
to sleep apart because he needed to get sleep

52:28.677 --> 52:31.513
he came to me and he said...

52:31.547 --> 52:33.483
"Does this mean we're separated?"

52:36.951 --> 52:39.622
For someone so brilliant to say something like that.

52:40.855 --> 52:42.859
Such a mismatch of reality.

52:45.060 --> 52:46.528
Five minutes later...

52:48.364 --> 52:49.932
he was back

52:49.964 --> 52:50.865
and he realized,

52:50.900 --> 52:52.969
no, we're in love and we're married.

52:53.735 --> 52:54.737
There's no...

52:56.538 --> 52:57.674
I'm not leaving him.

53:01.844 --> 53:04.781
Robin was in the house visiting and...

53:04.813 --> 53:07.417
he wanted me to look out the back window,

53:07.449 --> 53:09.551
look at our boat dock and our boats

53:09.585 --> 53:12.054
and get a different view.

53:13.522 --> 53:16.826
And so, he looked out the back window,

53:16.859 --> 53:19.561
here, out of our sun room,

53:19.594 --> 53:21.964
he stood there and stood there,

53:21.996 --> 53:24.032
and stood there

53:24.065 --> 53:29.471
for about 10-12 minutes motionless.

53:29.505 --> 53:32.975
Didn't say a word. Just stood there and looked.

53:33.007 --> 53:37.513
For the longest period of time. Way too long.

53:37.545 --> 53:40.949
I finally said, "Robin, let's go back outside."

53:48.723 --> 53:50.559
In the middle of the storm,

53:51.659 --> 53:54.996
we kept trying to stay in the center.

53:55.029 --> 53:57.999
By now though, we were seeing the therapists every day,

53:58.032 --> 54:00.502
it's bike rides, it's 12 step work.

54:00.536 --> 54:03.438
Meditating together helped a little bit.

54:03.471 --> 54:06.408
We went to a hypnotist at Stanford.

54:06.442 --> 54:08.644
And God bless the man, he did everything.

54:08.677 --> 54:10.113
I would come in the room, and he would be sitting there

54:10.145 --> 54:12.514
doing this thing and it was part of the deal

54:12.547 --> 54:14.049
to like, hypnotize yourself.

54:15.016 --> 54:16.685
Kind of worked, a little bit.

54:16.719 --> 54:18.154
But it would always be temporary.

54:18.186 --> 54:19.855
But he would keep trying.

54:20.755 --> 54:22.891
He was a freaking warrior.

54:22.924 --> 54:24.960
The way that he was able

54:24.993 --> 54:29.030
to battle the inner turmoils, the inner fears.

54:29.063 --> 54:33.369
He was blessed with what his heart was capable of,

54:34.170 --> 54:36.873
in the midst of fear.

54:36.906 --> 54:39.475
You go your whole life never knowing how you look

54:39.507 --> 54:41.710
and then, there you are.

54:42.777 --> 54:44.580
You get hungry, you get stupid,

54:44.612 --> 54:46.081
you get shot and die.

54:46.114 --> 54:49.851
Then you get this quick glimpse of how you look to others,

54:49.884 --> 54:53.955
to the world around you. It's never what you thought.

54:53.989 --> 54:57.960
He could do what nobody else could do.

54:57.993 --> 55:01.431
He'd do what very few artists have ever been able to do.

55:01.464 --> 55:04.801
He was just... he was beautiful.

55:04.833 --> 55:08.136
I remember, the day I found out I was thrilled.

55:08.170 --> 55:10.206
Robin Williams is going to come do

55:10.239 --> 55:12.475
Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.

55:12.507 --> 55:13.842
He's the tiger.

55:14.909 --> 55:18.714
The fact is, tigers are atheists.

55:19.848 --> 55:21.750
All of us unabashed.

55:21.784 --> 55:25.054
Heaven and Hell, these are just metaphorical constructs

55:25.087 --> 55:28.090
which represent hungry and not hungry.

55:28.123 --> 55:32.962
I would see him waiting after the play,

55:32.994 --> 55:35.697
after we'd come out from a two hour and 20 minute show

55:35.730 --> 55:38.633
and he's waiting for every single person

55:38.667 --> 55:41.536
to get their picture and to sign their playbill.

55:41.569 --> 55:44.906
And I learned patience, and I learned compassion.

55:44.940 --> 55:48.811
He's everything you want from a fellow artist.

55:48.844 --> 55:52.514
- Hey, Kellen. - Looking hot in the green room.

55:55.150 --> 55:58.821
He'd go in and extend these mercy calls

55:58.853 --> 56:01.089
to the comedians in the green room.

56:01.123 --> 56:03.726
They all looked upon him as a hero,

56:03.759 --> 56:06.862
and he's more than generous.

56:06.895 --> 56:09.865
Wait, can we get you doing the guy who hit our car today?

56:09.898 --> 56:12.969
- Please? - No! Dude! No.

56:13.002 --> 56:16.505
- Nothing. - Dude, you hit my rental car, man.

56:16.538 --> 56:19.007
No, dude. I did but nothing happened.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.643
- That was like before and nothing happened. - That's so silly.

56:21.677 --> 56:23.579
Do you have insurance, maybe?

56:23.612 --> 56:25.782
Oh, not at all, thanks.

56:33.855 --> 56:35.857
That last bike ride with Robin,

56:35.891 --> 56:37.659
I asked him at the beginning of the ride, "You look beat."

56:37.692 --> 56:39.895
"Are you sure you're okay for a ride? You look exhausted"

56:39.929 --> 56:41.797
He said no, he needed it. He really needed it

56:41.830 --> 56:42.898
and was ready to do it.

56:42.931 --> 56:43.933
But it was clear he was off,

56:43.967 --> 56:46.569
off in a way he had not ever been off before.

56:46.601 --> 56:49.672
Much slimmer, just sort of not there.

56:51.639 --> 56:54.609
Couple of times he was over in the lane way more than

56:54.643 --> 56:58.114
he should have been. Way more toward the center of the lane.

56:58.147 --> 57:00.016
He asked a lot of weird questions,

57:00.049 --> 57:02.150
seemed oddly distracted.

57:02.183 --> 57:06.321
Turned around and he'd say stuff like, "What time you got, boss?"

57:06.355 --> 57:08.958
Never asked me that on a ride ever before.

57:08.991 --> 57:12.194
I'd say, "I don't know, we left it one, we're halfway through 1:30?"

57:12.226 --> 57:13.862
"Thanks, boss."

57:15.230 --> 57:18.902
Thirty seconds later. "What time do you got, boss?"

57:20.235 --> 57:23.806
Forty-five seconds later. The same question again.

57:23.839 --> 57:28.610
There were several other questions he asked that were odd and didn't make sense.

57:28.643 --> 57:32.814
Um, something along the lines, I think we should maybe getting back and we took

57:32.848 --> 57:36.118
one loop, we're getting back, that kind of stuff.

57:36.150 --> 57:39.688
Before you notice it, he started to leave me,

57:39.721 --> 57:42.725
he just was 20 yards and then 40 then 100.

57:42.757 --> 57:44.326
This has never happened in the ride.

57:44.360 --> 57:48.197
And all of a sudden he was a hundred and some yards and I couldn't catch him.

57:48.230 --> 57:50.666
I busted butt to catch up.

57:50.699 --> 57:52.969
I couldn't do it. But he pedaled all the way to the house,

57:53.002 --> 57:54.137
and we get to the house and he said,

57:54.170 --> 57:57.106
"Hope you don't mind, boss, but I got to get in today.

57:57.139 --> 57:59.309
"I got stuff to do." And I said, "Fine." And he hustled in the house.

58:15.757 --> 58:20.895
Uncharacteristically, around 9:30 in the evening,

58:20.929 --> 58:27.670
Carol noticed Robin and Leonard standing out front,

58:27.703 --> 58:34.677
I went outside and I asked if everything was okay.

58:34.710 --> 58:38.947
And he said, "Yes, I'm okay."

58:38.980 --> 58:41.249
Just sort of a pat answer.

58:41.282 --> 58:45.654
And then he said, "Boss, I really need a hug."

58:46.388 --> 58:49.958
And so I gave him a hug.

58:49.991 --> 58:56.197
And he started to cry at that point, put his head down.

58:56.230 --> 58:59.701
So I put my arm around his shoulder, but then

58:59.735 --> 59:03.205
I asked him, "Robin, Robin, are you okay?

59:03.237 --> 59:06.875
"Is anything wrong that I could help?

59:06.909 --> 59:08.244
"Are you in pain?"

59:08.277 --> 59:12.114
He said, uh, "No, boss."

59:12.147 --> 59:17.253
He talked about family and what was going on

59:17.286 --> 59:21.357
in his life and some things that

59:21.389 --> 59:25.694
I think he felt I would keep private.

59:27.228 --> 59:32.132
It took about 15 minutes. He said, "Bye, boss."

59:32.134 --> 59:34.170
I said, "I'll see you tomorrow."

59:34.203 --> 59:37.907
And he walked home.

59:41.810 --> 59:44.313
We were going to try and get to bed at a decent hour.

59:44.346 --> 59:48.985
And we stayed up for a little while, which is what we did that week.

59:50.052 --> 59:52.154
When sleeping apart it's like, well,

59:52.186 --> 59:55.924
we'd stay in our bed together until it was time to go to sleep.

59:55.958 --> 01:00:01.230
Again, I'd read to him, then it was just time for sleep

01:00:01.263 --> 01:00:05.500
and he, uh... he went into his office,

01:00:05.534 --> 01:00:09.338
which is right by our room and he went back there a couple of times to get things,

01:00:09.371 --> 01:00:12.273
and I saw he had his iPad and I thought,

01:00:12.306 --> 01:00:16.011
"This is really good because he hasn't wanted to read

01:00:16.043 --> 01:00:20.949
"or do any, you know, anything in a long time."

01:00:20.982 --> 01:00:24.385
We just said good night to each other. "Good night, my love."

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:26.822
"Good night, my love."

01:00:36.397 --> 01:00:38.800
We'd been meditating every morning together.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:42.971
So, when I got up and he wasn't up yet,

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:45.141
I thought, "Oh my God, the door's still closed.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:50.780
"He's sleeping, he's sleeping, this is really good."

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.150
His assistant showed up because they had some work stuff to go over

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:57.186
and I had to take off and I just told her, I said,

01:00:57.219 --> 01:00:59.755
you know, "Just text me when he's awake."

01:01:01.255 --> 01:01:02.891
Apparently he had slept in.

01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:07.562
And they couldn't figure out why he was sleeping in because it wasn't him. Right?

01:01:07.596 --> 01:01:10.166
And they tried to go in the room and it was locked.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.070
Then I got a text saying...

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:20.476
"He's not up, what should I do?"

01:01:20.509 --> 01:01:27.049
I knew... I just knew there was something terribly, terribly wrong,

01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:30.051
that wasn't right, and I just texted,

01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:33.456
"Wake him up immediately and call me back."

01:01:38.493 --> 01:01:40.429
She called me back.

01:01:48.103 --> 01:01:50.172
Susan had just come back.

01:01:50.205 --> 01:01:54.310
Dan and Rebecca were outside the house.

01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:58.047
The police were showing up and they didn't know what was going on.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:03.484
Sister came in the kitchen and said, "How are you?"

01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:06.222
And I said, "I'm fine." She goes, "Oh, so you... Oh my God, you don't know?"

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.390
And then she told me, you know.

01:02:08.422 --> 01:02:11.893
I was just sitting with a tsunami of grief.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:20.969
I'm driving back, on this day three years ago. And a reporter

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:24.539
from a tabloid called me on my phone.

01:02:24.572 --> 01:02:27.243
I don't even know how they got my number.

01:02:27.275 --> 01:02:29.611
And they said, "Do you have any comments about the death

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:33.415
"of your friend, Robin Williams, by suicide?"

01:02:33.447 --> 01:02:37.485
And I threw my goddamned phone across the car and kept driving.

01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:43.424
I remember very distinctly, we were standing out front

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:47.596
and you could hear a helicopter coming.

01:02:47.628 --> 01:02:50.333
He said, "Okay, here they come."

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:55.404
The whole Bay Area felt like a sledge hammer

01:02:55.436 --> 01:02:59.141
hit it in the head that day and New York too and Hollywood and everywhere.

01:02:59.174 --> 01:03:02.210
It was like a war zone, helicopter circling,

01:03:02.243 --> 01:03:04.979
news vans pulling up their big satellite dishes

01:03:05.013 --> 01:03:06.482
and they're all setting up cameras.

01:03:06.514 --> 01:03:09.183
They're knocking on our door asking for comment.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:11.320
It got pretty crazy around here.

01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:16.992
The global media descended on this little cul-de-sac.

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:19.161
How everybody just wanted their piece.

01:03:21.529 --> 01:03:26.467
We felt that it was a huge invasion of privacy.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:31.339
This was a horrifically tragic event to happen

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:34.911
to normal people that are our neighbors.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.417
We also had fans of Robin's

01:03:41.449 --> 01:03:43.685
that just wanted to come and pay tribute

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:48.357
and they would stand peacefully in front of his house and lay

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:52.161
flowers down and just pay their respects.

01:03:56.264 --> 01:04:00.035
You know, it's like really having...

01:04:00.067 --> 01:04:05.107
a limb or something ripped from you and you can't heal it right away.

01:04:14.715 --> 01:04:20.022
I remember walking out of that facility down the steps outside

01:04:20.054 --> 01:04:24.426
and feeling the last year and a half

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:30.031
of really hard work that my husband and I went through.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:32.969
I had the beginning of an answer.

01:04:34.268 --> 01:04:38.006
I started digging in for about the next year.

01:05:05.132 --> 01:05:08.203
You can't come back from Lewy Body Dementia.

01:05:08.235 --> 01:05:11.306
There is no cure. Depression, you can come back from.

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:14.310
He had come back from that earlier in life.

01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:19.747
Clumsy as it was, not in the right state of mind due to the tricks

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:24.686
that the disease plays on you and the lack of sleep and everything.

01:05:24.719 --> 01:05:28.791
But I think he just probably somewhere in his brain has decided,

01:05:30.324 --> 01:05:32.261
"I don't want to bring everybody down with me.

01:05:32.293 --> 01:05:34.797
"I don't want to spend a year or two going down this path."

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:37.732
Maybe he didn't have quite that level of consciousness. But knowing Robin,

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:40.601
"I want to ride my bike. I want to be with my beautiful wife. I want to do comedy."

01:05:40.634 --> 01:05:46.808
These things will probably all be off the books in a very short time.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.311
I just know that he finally one day said,

01:05:49.344 --> 01:05:50.846
"I'm not going to go where this is taking me."

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:55.083
But he's just so joyous. And then there would've been no joy in his life.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:59.687
No, he wasn't ready to go. He wasn't ready to go at all.

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:03.692
And he stuck around longer than he felt like it. I mean, I just know him

01:06:03.725 --> 01:06:08.831
because he wasn't ready to say goodbye to Susan or to life.

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:15.270
You know, when someone gets sick like that because it's so confusing.

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:18.239
It's not their heart that's sick.

01:06:18.272 --> 01:06:20.808
It's the mainframe, it's the computer,

01:06:20.842 --> 01:06:24.646
and that's very different,

01:06:24.679 --> 01:06:26.715
very different.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:33.554
Lewy body gives nobody a chance to prepare.

01:06:33.587 --> 01:06:39.393
The psychiatry is the disease. It's the manifestation of the disease in the brain stem.

01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:42.564
I think in this country, this is a big problem, that mental health

01:06:42.596 --> 01:06:45.234
and neurology are seen as separate.

01:06:45.266 --> 01:06:48.469
In fact, it's all abnormalities of brain circuits

01:06:48.502 --> 01:06:55.243
when your brain is not functioning to allow you to be a fulfilled human being.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:58.813
So there's a tendency to blame people for their behaviors

01:06:58.846 --> 01:07:02.717
and their illness, and a certain mindset around disease

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.154
that people are responsible for their own disease. They aren't.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:09.925
I think there's a blame-free world, just like when someone has cancer,

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.160
no blame.

01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:32.313
Robin Williams' widow is speaking out about the beloved comedian's...

01:07:32.346 --> 01:07:34.649
Speaking out for the first time since he took his life...

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.851
Susan Williams is breaking her silence.

01:07:36.884 --> 01:07:39.888
It's been a year since his death. I see you're still wearing your wedding ring.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.790
- How're you doing? - I'm doing okay.

01:07:41.822 --> 01:07:43.725
It's been a year of grieving.

01:07:43.757 --> 01:07:45.826
Uh, and it's been a year of

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.796
really trying to get to the bottom of what killed my husband.

01:07:47.828 --> 01:07:50.898
Susan Schneider Williams wrote an editorial for the journal Neurology...

01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:54.669
For her first TV interview since writing about Robin's health struggles.

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:58.340
People think your husband killed himself because he was depressed.

01:07:58.373 --> 01:08:00.576
Everyone thought that he died from suicide,

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.411
from depression. But that wasn't the case?

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:04.913
No, Robin did not die from depression.

01:08:04.946 --> 01:08:11.420
Robin had a deadly disease and it's called Lewy Body Dementia.

01:08:11.453 --> 01:08:13.889
Everybody deals with grief in their own way.

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:19.795
The part that needs the focus and attention is,

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:23.764
let's cure this disease. No one should have to go through that.

01:08:23.798 --> 01:08:28.237
No one should have to feel the level of pain that Robin felt.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.540
And he's one of millions.

01:08:31.572 --> 01:08:33.475
But what she's done, is educating

01:08:33.508 --> 01:08:36.877
everyone that cares to know what really happened,

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.645
the real story about his last year.

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:42.984
Autopsy reports diagnosed Williams with diffuse Lewy Body Dementia.

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:44.752
Lewy Body Dementia.

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:48.288
To a form of dementia, he had what's known as Lewy Body Dementia.

01:08:48.322 --> 01:08:51.859
Which was discovered only after his death.

01:08:51.892 --> 01:08:55.595
When you don't have a diagnosis and you're going down

01:08:55.629 --> 01:09:00.667
these trails of trying to find out what's going on, that is scary.

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:03.004
The terror of where's this coming from?

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:06.907
Robin asked, "Do I have dementia,

01:09:06.941 --> 01:09:09.511
"am I schizophrenic?"

01:09:09.544 --> 01:09:13.282
And okay now, right? Is that clear or not?

01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:14.782
This is what other families are going through.

01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:17.486
An example of what's going on in many of these lives.

01:09:19.486 --> 01:09:20.822
Having a diagnosis...

01:09:21.923 --> 01:09:23.759
would've meant everything.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:31.066
Doing the press for that last movie was really,

01:09:31.098 --> 01:09:34.703
I mean, it was very complicated emotionally

01:09:34.736 --> 01:09:38.674
and to be really blunt, I'm really proud of the fact that

01:09:38.706 --> 01:09:41.310
there were 200 people on that set every day,

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:42.778
and not one of them

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:48.783
spoke to anyone ever about the struggles we saw Robin enduring.

01:09:48.816 --> 01:09:52.886
But it no longer feels loyal to be silent about it,

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.891
but maybe more loyal to share without shame,

01:09:56.924 --> 01:10:01.562
without secrecy that, yeah, this guy was hurting.

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:04.532
He was going through something that he didn't have a name for yet.

01:10:04.566 --> 01:10:08.970
And it doesn't bring Robin back, but it does give clarity.

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:12.840
Because a completely new variable was entered

01:10:12.874 --> 01:10:17.478
late into the equation of Robin Williams' life, which ended his life.

01:10:17.512 --> 01:10:20.749
The Robin that we watched all those years,

01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:22.984
the man who put himself out there,

01:10:23.017 --> 01:10:26.355
the man who went overseas to entertain troops,

01:10:26.387 --> 01:10:30.057
the man who would entertain the crews on the sets,

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:33.995
the man who would hug and hold on to his friends.

01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.731
That was very real.

01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:48.976
After he left, in his bedside table there was a few items,

01:10:49.009 --> 01:10:54.048
just a few things. And every once in a while, I would pull that drawer open,

01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:57.651
one...

01:10:57.685 --> 01:11:01.589
when I missed him, and just wanted him to tell me something.

01:11:03.157 --> 01:11:05.727
I opened up that book and I was like, "Wow."

01:11:13.034 --> 01:11:17.873
And I remember that when we were talking about what we wanted to

01:11:17.905 --> 01:11:22.510
be able to leave as our legacy.

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:27.883
And for Robin, it was that, that he wanted to help people be less afraid.

01:11:40.061 --> 01:11:44.965
When you get to know Robin, just as our friend and our neighbor,

01:11:44.999 --> 01:11:47.469
like all of us knew him.

01:11:47.502 --> 01:11:50.105
That's one thing. But when you actually, there's a realization

01:11:50.137 --> 01:11:55.510
about the impact that he had on a global basis.

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:10.992
The last scene for the Night at the Museum franchise

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:14.596
is Robin and Ben Stiller saying goodbye,

01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:18.500
and knowing that they are probably not going to see each other again.

01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:20.701
That was the scene.

01:12:20.735 --> 01:12:23.906
We didn't realize that that was real life.

01:12:25.673 --> 01:12:28.109
It's time for your next adventure.

01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:30.212
I have no idea what I'm going to do tomorrow.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.815
How exciting.

01:12:39.187 --> 01:12:41.923
Goodbye, Teddy.

01:12:41.955 --> 01:12:44.659
Farewell, Lawrence.

01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:50.965
If you saw his movies,

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:57.239
Robin's movies, you saw one side of Robin.

01:12:57.271 --> 01:13:00.609
But the biggest blessing is who he was as a human being.

01:13:03.745 --> 01:13:08.282
He was a loving soul and that was who he was.

01:13:08.316 --> 01:13:10.519
He was totally open, you know.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.624
And he understood the bigness of love.

01:13:18.058 --> 01:13:22.096
Oh, man. This guy, I mean, I feel him around all the time.

01:13:22.129 --> 01:13:24.565
There'll be a moment when I just burst out laughing.

01:13:24.598 --> 01:13:27.636
I hear his voice in my ear.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:30.305
It's just one of the joys of my life, if not the,

01:13:30.338 --> 01:13:32.040
I mean, that was the best friend I ever had.

01:13:32.072 --> 01:13:34.942
You know what I mean? Truly, it was just the time.

01:13:34.976 --> 01:13:36.844
It was the ride of a life, man

01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:42.117
I just love him so much.

01:13:53.727 --> 01:13:55.797
Yeah, there's a sadness and then you have to go.

01:13:55.829 --> 01:14:00.034
Then there's also hope. Sadness, it's always like

01:14:00.067 --> 01:14:02.670
you wish they hadn't happened, but they did.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.272
And the purpose is to make you different.

01:14:04.304 --> 01:14:06.575
It's what they call the Buddhist gift.

01:14:06.607 --> 01:14:08.810
It's that idea of

01:14:08.843 --> 01:14:13.014
you're back and you realize the thing that matters are others,

01:14:13.047 --> 01:14:15.215
way beyond yourself.

01:14:15.249 --> 01:14:18.954
Self goes away, ego bye-bye.

01:14:18.986 --> 01:14:22.190
You realize there are a lot of amazing people out there

01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:24.926
to be grateful for, and a loving God.

01:14:24.959 --> 01:14:28.129
Other than that, good luck.

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:30.031
That's what life is about.
