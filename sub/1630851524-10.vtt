They escaped individually

Governor Garcia's holding

These men are possibly armed

06:07.534 --> 06:09.494

06:07.534 --> 06:09.494
extremely dangerous.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.329
- Any ideas as to motive?

06:11.329 --> 06:12.872
- No ransom demands as of yet,

06:12.872 --> 06:14.332
but we're not ruling out

06:12.872 --> 06:14.332
the possibility

06:14.332 --> 06:15.917
this is ransomware.

It's possible

06:15.917 --> 06:17.711
one of the inmates

06:17.711 --> 06:19.400

- Enlighten your colleagues,

06:25.552 --> 06:27.595

40 times

06:35.270 --> 06:36.855
in the TSC/terror nexus.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.982
- Which, of course,

06:36.855 --> 06:38.982
puts McClane high

06:38.982 --> 06:41.609

Sergeant Bell.

Any idea how they got in

06:51.745 --> 06:54.497
to the system?

06:54.497 --> 06:57.420
- A prison employee's computer

while connecting to a fast food

07:00.128 --> 07:03.600

07:03.600 --> 07:04.674
- Was state correction's

07:03.600 --> 07:04.674
cyber team able

07:04.674 --> 07:07.510
to isolate the script?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.510

- Wow.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.730
- Yeah.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.190
Good luck tracking it.

07:22.670 --> 07:23.260

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
My guest, Richard Wheatley,

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
was a tech innovator,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.575
son of a mafia don,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.575
and, most recently,

07:30.575 --> 07:32.619
a cooperating witness

07:30.575 --> 07:32.619
for the federal government

07:32.619 --> 07:34.412
after being accused

07:32.619 --> 07:34.412
of murdering

07:34.412 --> 07:36.706
an NYPD officer's wife.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.409
- Are you lost, or--

07:36.706 --> 07:38.409
- No, no.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.920
- Thanks, Richard,

07:39.918 --> 07:41.920
for choosing "Flexpoint"

07:41.920 --> 07:45.600
as the opening act

07:41.920 --> 07:45.600
on your redemption tour.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.425
- Always a cynic, Sara.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.761
I'd appreciate you mentioning

07:47.425 --> 07:49.761
I've been fully exonerated

07:49.761 --> 07:50.845
of those charges.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.223
- You've been cleared of them.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.974
Is that the same thing as being

07:53.223 --> 07:54.974
fully exonerated?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.351
- Semantics.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.269
But if you want to talk

07:56.351 --> 07:58.269
about the past...

07:58.269 --> 07:59.854
- It seems you don't.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.523

07:59.854 --> 08:01.523

08:01.523 --> 08:04.192

08:04.192 --> 08:06.444
To fixate on retaliating

08:04.192 --> 08:06.444
against those

08:06.444 --> 08:08.196
who falsely accused me.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.448
I lost my home,

08:10.448 --> 08:12.283
my company,

08:12.283 --> 08:13.660
and my fortune.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.954
- An ill-gained fortune,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.954
apparently.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.998
Isn't that why you cooperated

08:15.954 --> 08:18.998
with the feds?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.626
In exchange,

08:18.998 --> 08:21.626
all the RICO charges

08:21.626 --> 08:23.300
against you were dropped.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.588

10:09.943 --> 10:12.612
were arrested.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.447
<i>Moon cut a deal and walked.</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:16.533
<i>McClane is doing</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:16.533
<i>a five-year state bid</i>

10:16.533 --> 10:19.160
and still has a 30-year

10:16.533 --> 10:19.160
fed sentence waiting.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.370
- So the prison hack

10:19.160 --> 10:21.370
matches his MO.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.582
<i>- McClane's been behind bars</i>

10:21.370 --> 10:24.582

<i>electronic devices.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:30.672
This is guy is

10:28.628 --> 10:30.672
a master manipulator.

10:39.305 --> 10:53.403

10:54.404 --> 10:55.405
- What about the communal

10:54.404 --> 10:55.405
computer in the library?

10:56.281 --> 10:57.407
Does it connect

10:56.281 --> 10:57.407
to the internet?

10:57.407 --> 10:59.242
- No. It's offline.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.494
Besides, there's no way

10:59.242 --> 11:01.494
McClane got near it.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.747
He had an extra detail to keep

11:01.494 --> 11:03.747
him off that stuff.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.820
- Sloot.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.258
- Any idea what these could be,

11:12.464 --> 11:15.258
captain?

11:15.258 --> 11:16.926
- Looks like someone was

11:15.258 --> 11:16.926
sending him messages.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.970
- We might have just

11:19.179 --> 11:21.970
found out who.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.479
- I'm the only woman CO

11:24.893 --> 11:27.479
at Remsen.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.356
Sebastian looked after me.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.441
I really didn't think of him

11:29.356 --> 11:31.441
as an inmate.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.194
- Except you locked him

11:31.441 --> 11:34.194
in a cell every night.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.695
Is that where you would

11:34.194 --> 11:35.695
hook up?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.300
In his cell?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.340
- It was more than just

11:38.406 --> 11:41.340
a hook up.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.994
Did Constantine tell you

11:41.340 --> 11:42.994
about his plan

11:42.994 --> 11:45.413
to break out of prison?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.956
- Constantine?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.167
- That was McClane's handle

11:46.956 --> 11:49.167
on the dark web.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.795
He was notorious.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.880
- I didn't know anything

11:51.795 --> 11:53.880
about this.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.798
He would have told me.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.883
He would have at least found

11:54.798 --> 11:56.883
a way to say good bye.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.886
Men like him are experts

11:56.883 --> 11:59.886
at manipulation.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.550
- Sebastian wasn't

11:59.886 --> 12:02.550
manipulating me.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.266
He cares about me.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.180
- Did you ever give him

12:05.266 --> 12:07.180
anything?

12:07.180 --> 12:09.104
Besides the notes

12:07.180 --> 12:09.104
on the Sip O' Noodles lids?

12:09.104 --> 12:10.897
- No.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.941
- What about

12:10.897 --> 12:12.941
a contraband phone?

12:12.941 --> 12:15.527
- I told you--

12:12.941 --> 12:15.527
- What about your phone?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.653
You ever let him use that?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.740
- It was only a few times.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.701
His mother was sick.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.827
He had to get in touch

12:22.701 --> 12:23.827
with her.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.578
- His mother? You're sure

12:23.827 --> 12:25.578
that's what he said.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.913
- Yeah, why?

12:26.913 --> 12:29.833
- His mother's been dead

12:26.913 --> 12:29.833
for seven years.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.383
- Not exactly

12:36.589 --> 12:38.383
what I was expecting.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.801
- Definitely doesn't look

12:38.383 --> 12:39.801
like the home

12:39.801 --> 12:41.678
of a slacker kid in a hoodie.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.765
- Maybe he's turned over

12:44.264 --> 12:45.765
a new leaf.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.350
- Maybe he's hiding under one.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.940
- Can I help you?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.442
- We're looking for Rogin Moon.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.776
- That's my husband.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.361
- We need to speak with him.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.618
- McClane was behind it?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.618
- You tell us.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.620
- I haven't spoken to the guy

13:05.618 --> 13:07.620
in over five years.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.206
We didn't exactly part

13:07.620 --> 13:10.206
on the best of terms.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.292
- 'Cause you cooperated

13:10.206 --> 13:12.292
with the feds?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.836
- It was the right thing to do.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.836
He had to be stopped.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.213
- Tell us more about that.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.382
- I was on board

13:17.213 --> 13:19.382
for the corporate level stuff.

13:19.382 --> 13:23.470
You know, hacking companies,

13:19.382 --> 13:23.470

13:26.140 --> 13:28.600
But Sebastian took it too far.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.269
The Federal Reserve,

13:28.600 --> 13:31.269
that was his idea.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.481
And for me, well, I wasn't

- What are you doing

13:50.163 --> 13:52.207

13:52.207 --> 13:54.626
- I'm a data analyst

13:52.207 --> 13:54.626
for an insurance company.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.336
- So much for Marxist idealism.

What kind of car is that?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.530

17:04.232 --> 17:05.233
- McClane accessed

17:04.232 --> 17:05.233
the car's operating system

17:06.670 --> 17:07.152
so he could control it

17:06.670 --> 17:07.152

- Run an extended

17:10.488 --> 17:12.198

17:12.198 --> 17:13.867

17:13.867 --> 17:15.452
because his features

I guarantee you,

17:16.911 --> 17:19.830
he messed up his own face

17:19.830 --> 17:22.250
so we couldn't track him.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.585
That's so metal.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.880
- You lied to us.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.968
- Look, Sebastian called me

17:29.507 --> 17:31.968
the night he escaped.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.971
He told me to meet him

17:31.968 --> 17:34.971

17:34.971 --> 17:37.390
Said if I didn't, he'd--

17:34.971 --> 17:37.390
he'd finish me off for good.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.559
- He threatened to kill you?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.354
- Not kill me, worse.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.640
He's Constantine.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.899
He still has

17:44.640 --> 17:45.899
a legion of followers

17:45.899 --> 17:48.109
and they can touch everyone

17:45.899 --> 17:48.109

17:48.109 --> 17:49.527
that's ever touched me--

- Okay, I got it.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.528
- Where is he now?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.947
- I have no idea.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.283
- Sure about that?

17:52.947 --> 17:55.283
You have no idea?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.826
- I--

17:56.826 --> 17:59.829
- This phone is

18:04.167 --> 18:06.461
McClane sent you text messages

18:04.167 --> 18:06.461
from this phone.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.296
- Okay, yeah. He did.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.799
But it wasn't anything illegal.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.799
- Mm.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.426
- Nothing about

18:10.799 --> 18:13.426
trying to escape.

18:13.426 --> 18:18.306
He feels guilty

18:13.426 --> 18:18.306
about that guy who died

18:18.306 --> 18:19.849
When we hacked the Fed.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.601
- The janitor?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.601
- Yeah.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.728
He wanted me to get in touch

18:21.601 --> 18:23.728
with the guy's wife,

18:25.313 --> 18:26.940

18:26.940 --> 18:28.733

18:26.940 --> 18:28.733
I can't get involved.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.634
- No, it's not his style.

It's unlikely

19:02.225 --> 19:03.685

19:09.107 --> 19:10.650
- What?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.194
No. Do not make me do this.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.530
- Jet, listen to me.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.530
- I don't need his help.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.906
I can do this myself.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.616

We know you can.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.827
- But the clock is ticking.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.997
Look, we just want you to bring

19:20.827 --> 19:23.997
in Adam Mintock to help you.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.999
- How am I supposed

19:23.997 --> 19:25.999

19:25.999 --> 19:28.126
He lives off the grid.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.126
- Yeah, not anymore.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.300
We have him under house arrest.

Mintock.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.848

his front door.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.933

- He has an iris scanner

19:45.894 --> 19:48.104
So predictable.

his ankle bracelet,

he's in here somewhere.

Looks like he's back to

20:39.739 --> 20:41.866
so.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.244

You know I can have you

21:12.397 --> 21:15.191
you could have just called.

- I came to ask for your help

21:15.191 --> 21:17.902

Arrest me.

So how can I save your ass

- You heard

about the prison break upstate?

21:45.263 --> 21:46.473
- Assume I didn't.

I assiduously don't watch

We're fairly sure

21:59.402 --> 22:01.290
the hack was orchestrated

22:01.290 --> 22:02.739
by Sebastian McClane.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.350

They're under a lot

Not just from Garcia.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.754

Detective Stabler,

Sanford Bennington

22:43.290 --> 22:44.989
- Stabler, I'm sorry.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.283
I know how you must feel.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.161

22:47.283 --> 22:50.161
to do with anything.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.955
He's making a fool of you.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.790
Out of all of us.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.251
- Wheatley helped the FBI

22:53.790 --> 22:56.251
arrest Vladimir Mikhailov,

22:56.251 --> 22:59.587
chief architect

22:56.251 --> 22:59.587
of the 2020 U.S. election hack.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.700
He's been their ace in the hole

22:59.587 --> 23:02.700
for several high profile busts.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.759
- You could have given us a

23:02.700 --> 23:04.759
heads up, Lieutenant Brewster.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.803
- You wouldn't have showed up

23:04.759 --> 23:06.803
for the meeting.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.140
Look, I know you don't want

23:06.803 --> 23:09.140

23:09.140 --> 23:10.974
- Well, that's not

23:09.140 --> 23:10.974
entirely true, is it?

23:14.190 --> 23:17.439
Detective Stabler has been

23:14.190 --> 23:17.439
stalking me.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.442
Think he might even be

23:17.439 --> 23:20.442
a little obsessed.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.985
Which belies the premise

23:20.442 --> 23:21.985
he doesn't want to be

23:21.985 --> 23:23.570
anywhere near me.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.989
But I do believe the man

23:23.570 --> 23:25.989
is capable

23:25.989 --> 23:30.160
of managing his emotions

23:25.989 --> 23:30.160
on behalf of the greater good.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.541
Detective, I don't expect

23:34.164 --> 23:36.541
you to accept

23:36.541 --> 23:39.336
or even believe that

23:36.541 --> 23:39.336
you and I are on the same team.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.379
But nonetheless,

23:39.336 --> 23:41.379
I've been engaged by the FBI

23:41.379 --> 23:44.257
to help solve

23:41.379 --> 23:44.257
this most important case.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.551
- I doubt you did it

23:44.257 --> 23:46.551
out of pure altruism.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.763
- Well, they are paying me

23:46.551 --> 23:49.763
a boatload, that's true.

23:49.763 --> 23:50.972
But I would do it for free.

Unlike Elliot here...

23:54.976 --> 23:56.436
I don't hold grudges.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.670
- I don't hold a grudge.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.486
Here's how it gonna work.

Feel free to pat me down again.

They brought me here

27:22.809 --> 27:26.312
And now, Sebastian McClane.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.814
That name ring a bell?

27:30.692 --> 27:33.653
- No. I--I don't know.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.655
- Used to go by Constantine.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.867
- I'm sorry.

27:38.867 --> 27:42.579
My memory still

27:38.867 --> 27:42.579
isn't what it used to be.

27:47.830 --> 27:48.168
Thank you.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.700
- Hmm?

27:52.297 --> 27:54.700
- Mm? No.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.930
I can--I--no, I can do it.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.930
Thank you.

28:09.898 --> 28:11.608
- Angela, be careful.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.863
- I'm okay.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.116
I'm actually getting better.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.202

28:20.116 --> 28:22.202
your ex-husband.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.790
I know what he promises.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.958
We both know what he delivers

28:26.790 --> 28:28.958
in the end.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.755
Be well.

28:33.755 --> 28:40.804

28:49.270 --> 28:50.980
It's almost like

28:49.270 --> 28:50.980
witnessing a miracle.

29:04.770 --> 29:06.788
- Am I late? Have I missed it?

29:04.770 --> 29:06.788
- No, right on time.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.666
- So nice to see so many

29:06.788 --> 29:09.666
friends here today.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.459
When I was a boy,

29:09.666 --> 29:11.459
I read everything

29:11.459 --> 29:12.961
I could get my hands on.

29:12.961 --> 29:16.297
Books, magazines,

29:12.961 --> 29:16.297
even the Sears catalog,

29:16.297 --> 29:17.966
which some of you probably

29:16.297 --> 29:17.966
don't even know

29:17.966 --> 29:19.592
what I'm talking about.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.520
Tells you how old I am, eh?

29:21.520 --> 29:22.804
[laughter]

29:22.804 --> 29:25.181
Having grown up

29:22.804 --> 29:25.181
in this very neighborhood

29:25.181 --> 29:28.180
where scarcity is

29:25.181 --> 29:28.180
a way of life,

29:28.180 --> 29:31.438
I hope that this library

29:28.180 --> 29:31.438
we're finally building here

29:31.438 --> 29:34.566
will be a source of all kinds

29:31.438 --> 29:34.566

29:34.566 --> 29:35.859
Gentlemen.

29:42.365 --> 29:47.787
Leon Kilbride

29:42.365 --> 29:47.787
Community Library.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.915
My hope is that this library

29:47.787 --> 29:50.915
will nurture

29:50.915 --> 29:54.878
the next generation of readers,

29:50.915 --> 29:54.878

29:54.878 --> 29:56.963

29:54.878 --> 29:56.963
Thank you.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.883
Thank you.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.223
Thank you.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.223
Thank you for coming.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.602
Hey.

30:10.602 --> 30:14.397
Denise, Ayanna, thank you

30:10.602 --> 30:14.397
so very much for coming out.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.315
- We wouldn't miss this

30:14.397 --> 30:15.315
for the world.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.650
- Aw.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.650
- Congratulations, Congressman.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.444
- Leon, please.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.946
- Well, Leon,

30:19.444 --> 30:21.946
I'm from this neighborhood too.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.990
And you don't know

30:21.946 --> 30:23.990
what it means to me

30:23.990 --> 30:25.158
to see you doing

30:23.990 --> 30:25.158
what you're doing.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.701
- Thank you.

30:26.701 --> 30:30.163
Can you please take a photo of

30:26.701 --> 30:30.163
me and these two lovely ladies?

30:38.380 --> 30:39.547
- Excuse me, Congressman.

30:39.547 --> 30:41.132
We have to get going

30:39.547 --> 30:41.132
to your next appointment.

30:41.132 --> 30:43.968
- Always, always. Denise.

30:41.132 --> 30:43.968
Always good to see you.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.387
- Of course.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.387
- Ayanna.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.389
I hope to see you soon.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.601
- Wow.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.235
- Sorry.

31:00.235 --> 31:01.695
He asked me to get lunch

31:00.235 --> 31:01.695
with him and his wife

31:01.695 --> 31:02.904
at the Red Rooster.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.156
- Perks of being a VP.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.282
- I guess.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.369
He's fronting like this library

31:07.659 --> 31:09.369
like it's something

31:09.369 --> 31:11.204
he's doing on his own.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.872
But I recognize

31:11.204 --> 31:12.872
a lot of the guys there.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.207
They work for Preston Webb.

31:16.751 --> 31:19.212
Yeah, that's Julian Adams.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.548
He's Webb's

31:19.212 --> 31:21.548
construction foreman.

31:21.548 --> 31:22.674
I don't know much about him

31:22.674 --> 31:24.500
other than

31:22.674 --> 31:24.500
he doesn't like gays.

31:24.500 --> 31:28.513
- Well, I imagine that's not

31:24.500 --> 31:28.513
an anomaly in Webb's circle.

31:28.513 --> 31:30.980
Look,

31:30.980 --> 31:33.590
right now all you gotta do

31:30.980 --> 31:33.590
is watch and listen.

31:33.590 --> 31:35.812
Kilbride trusting you enough

31:33.590 --> 31:35.812
to make you his aide,

31:35.812 --> 31:36.938
that's huge.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.609
All right, I gotta get back.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.609
Stay safe, okay?

31:41.609 --> 31:42.777
- Yeah, you too.

31:42.777 --> 31:49.951
<i>* </i>

32:02.839 --> 32:05.717
- Congressman.

32:02.839 --> 32:05.717
You're right on time.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.427
- Always, Julian.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.429
Everybody here?

32:07.427 --> 32:09.429
- They are.

32:09.429 --> 32:10.972
First things first.

32:18.396 --> 32:20.315
- Now I'm ready.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.358
Wait here.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.280
- Listen up, fellas.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.655
Every year,

32:25.280 --> 32:27.655
New York City awards

32:27.655 --> 32:31.451
30% of its government contracts

32:27.655 --> 32:31.451
to minority owned businesses.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.578
That works out to

32:31.451 --> 32:33.578
about a billion

32:33.578 --> 32:35.580
in the pockets

32:33.578 --> 32:35.580
of construction companies

32:35.580 --> 32:36.831
like Preston Webb's.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.376
That's why I made sure his firm

32:39.376 --> 32:42.170
was awarded the contract

32:39.376 --> 32:42.170
to build my library

32:42.170 --> 32:44.881
and he, in turn,

32:42.170 --> 32:44.881
hired all of you.

32:44.881 --> 32:47.550
Now, they tell me if things

32:44.881 --> 32:47.550
work out according to plan,

32:47.550 --> 32:50.136
this library will cost

32:47.550 --> 32:50.136
about 15 million to finish.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.388
Now, the thing is...

32:53.140 --> 32:55.392
We're not gonna

32:53.140 --> 32:55.392
let them finish it.

32:55.392 --> 32:58.610
I want delays.

32:55.392 --> 32:58.610
I want work stoppages.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.605
I want anything that

32:58.610 --> 33:00.605
will drive the cost up.

33:00.605 --> 33:02.857
Blame it on China,

33:00.605 --> 33:02.857
blame it on the supply chain,

33:02.857 --> 33:03.983
whatever.

33:05.235 --> 33:08.279
Just make sure Webb has reason

33:05.235 --> 33:08.279
to keep going back

33:08.279 --> 33:10.907
and asking for more money.

33:12.575 --> 33:13.785
Do you follow me?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.620
- Yes, sir.

33:24.587 --> 33:28.910
getting inside the VPN chain.

33:28.910 --> 33:29.843
Did you borrow

33:28.910 --> 33:29.843
an override command code

33:29.843 --> 33:31.261
from the Department of Defense?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.515
- You told me nothing illegal.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.170
- It wasn't illegal.

33:37.170 --> 33:38.935
It was quasi-legal.

33:38.935 --> 33:42.647
I'm willing to bet that

33:38.935 --> 33:42.647
Saratov, Russia's a misdirect.

33:42.647 --> 33:44.649
That your hacker's right here

33:42.647 --> 33:44.649
in New York.

33:44.649 --> 33:47.777
- Oh, and your smug certainty

33:44.649 --> 33:47.777
is based on...

33:47.777 --> 33:50.697
- The fact Sebastian McClane

33:47.777 --> 33:50.697
is here in New York.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.449
- That's a smart man.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.577
- All right, Mr. OG,

33:52.449 --> 33:55.577
what do you suggest?

33:55.577 --> 33:58.747
We run an OS INT

33:55.577 --> 33:58.747
on the Russian IP?

33:58.747 --> 34:00.457
- That's not gonna work here.

34:00.457 --> 34:03.209
Try tracing all the sockets

34:00.457 --> 34:03.209
form the Saratov system.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.295

then transfer that money

37:04.974 --> 37:06.590

Could take days, hours,

In this case, they've already

accessed the money.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.358
- I'll need the geotag...

37:11.272 --> 37:13.358
- Just sent it to you.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.318
- Information.

37:21.157 --> 37:23.702
Holy Cooter Brown.

Someone just withdrew $800

He's inside the house.

Don't move.

38:28.990 --> 38:31.144
- The hacker's name

is Carlos Martinez.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.812
He's no mastermind.

- The prison hack originated

38:35.398 --> 38:37.442
from his computer,

38:37.442 --> 38:39.736
but he was just following

38:37.442 --> 38:39.736

Hired by a computerized cypher,

38:42.405 --> 38:44.324
who created the template.

38:44.324 --> 38:46.760
- It's unlikely it was McClane.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.660
We know exactly where he was

38:46.760 --> 38:47.660
at the time of the hack,

38:47.660 --> 38:49.537
and he's had

38:47.660 --> 38:49.537

38:54.793 --> 38:57.128
Who just got a commendation

38:54.793 --> 38:57.128
from the FBI

38:57.128 --> 38:58.338
for helping them nail Martinez?

38:59.673 --> 39:01.910
- Wheatley.

39:01.910 --> 39:05.950
- You think Wheatley hired

39:01.910 --> 39:05.950
Martinez then sold him out?

39:28.368 --> 39:30.453

39:31.830 --> 39:33.915
- You did. Kudos.

39:35.875 --> 39:38.545

39:35.875 --> 39:38.545

- Ex-wife.

- Angela, this is--

39:50.682 --> 39:53.351
what do you prefer?

39:53.351 --> 39:55.228
Sebastian? Constantine?

39:55.228 --> 39:56.938
- Sebastian's fine.

39:56.938 --> 39:58.523
- It's an honor.

39:58.523 --> 39:59.649
I've heard much about you.

40:03.737 --> 40:06.781
- Did I tell you

40:03.737 --> 40:06.781
how Sebastian and I met

40:06.781 --> 40:08.450

40:06.781 --> 40:08.450

40:08.450 --> 40:10.702
yes.

40:10.702 --> 40:11.703
- Ah, you remembered.

40:11.703 --> 40:15.874
- Your ex-husband said

40:11.703 --> 40:15.874
that he had a plan

40:15.874 --> 40:18.126
to bust me out of prison.

40:18.126 --> 40:19.419
I thought he was crazy.

40:19.419 --> 40:21.254
- Oh, Richard's many things.

40:21.254 --> 40:22.797
But he's not crazy.

40:22.797 --> 40:25.800
- But I can't take

40:22.797 --> 40:25.800
all the credit.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.761
I lifted some of the code

40:25.800 --> 40:27.761
written by the man himself

40:27.761 --> 40:29.346
to accomplish the hack.

I wish I could have seen

40:29.346 --> 40:31.598

40:31.598 --> 40:34.309

40:34.309 --> 40:36.603

40:36.603 --> 40:38.146
- First, we eat.

40:38.146 --> 40:40.648
Then we talk.

40:40.648 --> 40:42.525
You can stay here tonight,
