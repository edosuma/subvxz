Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

00:34.048 --> 00:35.079
Hi.

00:35.081 --> 00:37.816
As you know,
parole is a privilege.

00:37.818 --> 00:40.552
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee,

00:40.554 --> 00:42.086
is to avoid the company

00:42.088 --> 00:45.156
of any person who has
a criminal record of any kind.

00:45.158 --> 00:47.326
That would include
most of your extended family.

00:47.328 --> 00:50.228
Yeah, that's obviously
not something I'm proud of.

00:50.230 --> 00:53.564

challenge for you?

00:53.566 --> 00:55.000
No. No.
