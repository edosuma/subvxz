01:38.515 --> 01:43.352
Fallow arriving, area A. Do you copy?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.568
Hi, Mr. Fallow. Welcome.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.862
- Oh, please, right this way.
- Step right out.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.865
Hi, so nice to see you!

01:57.033 --> 02:00.619
- Mr. Fallow, Mr. Bavardage. This way.
- Very nice to meet you.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.037
Careful with that.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.581
We're in a bit of a rush...

02:04.749 --> 02:06.875
so let's hop on the cart and get going.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.127
There are a lot of people waiting.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.630
We're so honored to have you.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.342
This is really an historic occasion, Peter.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.597
- I'll meet you upstairs.
- Here we go.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.767
Mr. Fallow, I'd like
to take this private moment...

02:24.060 --> 02:26.895
to tell you how much I admire your book.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.232
When Faulkner was asked
to recommend three novels, he said:

02:30.400 --> 02:32.776
"Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina,
Anna Karenina."

02:32.944 --> 02:36.572
"The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.242
The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb,
The Real McCoy and..."

02:41.786 --> 02:45.706
I know you've heard it a million times...

02:45.874 --> 02:51.044
but the scene where the mayor is hit
in the head with the mayonnaise jar...

02:51.212 --> 02:53.213
Well, to be continued.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.632
On our way. Oh, Mr. Fallow.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.426
Right this way.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.803
Here we go.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.597
Whoop-si-daisy.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.933
Okay. Excuse us, gentlemen.
Coming through.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.977
I've got Mr. Fallow.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.521
- Okay. Now...
- There he is!

03:11.608 --> 03:15.903
Oh, please! Get away!
This should never have happened.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.613
I'm so sorry.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.115
All right. Oh, get!

03:21.075 --> 03:23.285
Right this way, Mr. Fallow.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.747
We're just going through these two doors.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.791
We're on our way.

03:29.959 --> 03:34.504
But I must say, if I may quote you...

03:34.672 --> 03:37.966
Oh, Look at all the busy bees.

03:38.384 --> 03:42.596
But I must say, Mr. Fallow... Mr. Fallow?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.932
If I may quote you...

03:45.099 --> 03:48.268
"How in the name of God...?
Who in the name of God...

03:48.436 --> 03:52.231
would bring a half-eaten jar
of mayonnaise to a public meeting?"

03:52.398 --> 03:53.398
Ambassador!

03:53.566 --> 03:57.778
I'm Charles Buchanan. This is my wife,
Stephanie, and my daughter.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.781
Mr. Fallow, I read your book 15 times.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.827
Next year, next year I'm going
to take a course in it.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.164
One second, one second.
We're going to go up by ourselves.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.003
Are you hungry?

04:16.964 --> 04:20.509
That's salmon, but I don't think
you should touch that.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.642
Mr. Fallow, it's such an honor
to finally meet you.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.435
Oh, my God!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.104
Oh, my God!

04:32.272 --> 04:33.272
Is that him?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.274
We are running a bit late.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.318
I don't know what to say. Let me see...

04:38.486 --> 04:40.612
- What's your name?
- Suzanne.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.489
Are you married?

04:42.657 --> 04:43.991
Excuse me!

04:47.912 --> 04:52.040
Excuse me! Excuse me!

04:52.208 --> 04:53.917
Animals!

04:57.088 --> 04:58.547
Let's go, let's take this.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.215
Someone needs deodorant.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.175
Mr. Fallow. Mr. Fallow...

05:02.343 --> 05:06.555
All right, all right, here we go.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.640
Everything is under control.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.559
Nothing to worry about.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.064
Oh. Excuse me. I haven't
introduced myself, have I?

05:16.232 --> 05:18.191
My name is Peter Fallow.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.193
I am a writer.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.154
But you know that already.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.866
Unless you haven't read a newspaper
or seen a TV recently...

05:26.075 --> 05:28.910
you know exactly who I am.

05:29.078 --> 05:32.873
I am the man of the moment.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.375
The hero of the evening.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.670
Me and a book I happened to write.

05:39.589 --> 05:43.383
The real hero of the evening
is not even with us tonight.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.552
We'll come to him in a minute.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.097
For now, indulge yourself
in the extravagance of the moment...

05:49.265 --> 05:55.729
and remember, if you will,
a phrase from another little best-seller:

05:56.272 --> 06:01.610
"What does it profit a man if he gains
the whole world and loses his soul?"

06:01.778 --> 06:03.570
They're waiting.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.366
This is a story about such a man.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.287
There he is!

06:24.008 --> 06:27.427
And it begins on a rainy night
a little over a year ago.

06:33.726 --> 06:38.647
Our hero, Sherman McCoy,
was about to make a simple phone call.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.984
But despite the existence of 11 phones
and seven different lines...

06:43.152 --> 06:46.780
in the 14 rooms
of his $6-million-plus apartment...

06:47.031 --> 06:50.033
this was a phone call
he could not make at home.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.536
Gotcha.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.454
What on earth are you doing?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.959
I'm taking the dog for a walk.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.712
You're not taking "the dog" for a walk,
you're taking "Marshall."

07:02.880 --> 07:06.675
Marshall has a name. He's family.
And, anyway...

07:06.843 --> 07:08.301
it's raining.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.137
I know that.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.972
So does Marshall.

07:12.181 --> 07:16.435
He doesn't want to go.
Do you, Marshall?

07:16.602 --> 07:17.769
Judy...

07:18.813 --> 07:22.774
All right. Have a nice time.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.823
He's not happy about it, Mr. McCoy.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.158
Neither am I, Bill.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.368
Tony, sir. My name is Tony.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.162
Well, whatever.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.498
Oh, Marshall, come on.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.334
Let's be men about this.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.224
Hello, Sherman.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.976
Good evening, Pollard.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.769
It's raining, you know.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.230
I did notice, yes.

08:02.440 --> 08:07.903
Sherman, a true friend
to man's "pest" friend.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.449
Pollard, you old phrase-maker.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.867
I beg your pardon?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.286
Is that the best you can do?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.622
Is that as witty as we get?

08:18.873 --> 08:20.999
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:21.167 --> 08:26.296
Furthermore, if you're wet
when you return, take the service elevator.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.010
Come on, Marshall.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.929
Oh, Marshall, come on.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.225
Come on now. Come on. Come on.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.098
Maria, hello. It's me.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.016
Who?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.727
I'm sorry. May I speak to Maria?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.271
Who is this?

09:25.314 --> 09:26.773
Maria?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.692
Sherman?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.735
Sherman, is that you?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.071
Sherman?

09:35.449 --> 09:36.700
Jesus!

09:43.457 --> 09:45.083
We're back.

09:46.252 --> 09:50.255
You were right. I got soaking wet
and Marshall didn't do anything.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.173
Sherman?

09:52.341 --> 09:54.759
If you want to talk to a Maria...

09:54.927 --> 09:56.052
why call me?

09:56.220 --> 09:57.887
What do you mean?

09:58.097 --> 10:01.474
Please don't lie.
It makes your forehead crinkle.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.561
What are we talking about?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.940
You should see your face.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.402
I don't get it.
Did I miss something?

10:12.612 --> 10:17.198
You're going to stand there and say
you didn't call here asking for Maria?

10:17.366 --> 10:18.408
Who?

10:18.576 --> 10:21.328
You think I don't know your voice?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.830
Judy, I was out walking the dog.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.292
- Crinkle, crinkle.
- I was not on the telephone.

10:27.501 --> 10:32.255
I am not lying. I took the dog for a walk.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.591
Then I came back here, and wham.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.636
I hardly know what to say.

10:38.095 --> 10:41.097
You are asking me to prove
a negative proposition.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.558
Negative proposition?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.103
Oh, God, Sherman.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.524
Listen to the way I sound.
Listen to the stress. Hear it?

10:54.278 --> 10:56.946
I don't want to be this person. I don't.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.282
I am thin and beautiful.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.534
I do not deserve this.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.665
- Judy.
- Here's the phone. Call her from here.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.502
I don't mind. I really don't mind.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.756
You are cheap and rotten and a liar.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.385
And you are dripping
on my Aubusson carpet.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.014
She was right.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.808
And Sherman knew it.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.852
Christ! How could he have been so stupid?

11:28.562 --> 11:30.814
A simple phone call.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.526
The next day, Judy's words still rang
in his ears.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.820
"Cheap, rotten and a liar."

11:36.987 --> 11:40.323
- Campbell, are we ready?
- I'm out of here.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.367
Hold on.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.910
Where is your mother?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.453
Campbell!

11:45.621 --> 11:48.206
She's crying on the Lifecycle.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.877
"Crying on the Lifecycle."

11:53.671 --> 11:58.383
Like so many men before him,
he was no match for a woman's tears.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.721
She won't kiss me because I'm all wet.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.642
Campbell, come and give
your mother a kiss.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.027
Judy?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.370
"Look, Judy, I still love you."

12:27.621 --> 12:31.624
I still love our daughter,
our home, our life.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.544
But I am a Master of the Universe.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.713
"I deserve more."

12:45.890 --> 12:48.516
Like the few privileged others
on Wall Street.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.145
How many? Two, three,
maybe 400 at most.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.482
For these men,
these Masters of the Universe...

12:55.649 --> 12:57.817
and Sherman McCoy was one of them...

12:57.985 --> 13:00.487
there were no limits whatsoever.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.747
Hi. This is 555-8771.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.500
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Thank you.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.630
Maria, I've been calling you for days.
Call me at the office.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.590
Gene's on from London.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.676
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Calm down, Rawlie.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.553
Let's not get overexcited.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.598
- Yes, Sherman. Sorry.
- Calm, cool, collated.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.185
Let's not lose our composure
over a few hundred million dollars.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.271
Christ, Sherman, you must be made of ice.

13:35.439 --> 13:40.401
Just remember, a frantic salesman
is a dead one.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.696
What the hell
will this crazy Giscard deal cost us?

13:43.864 --> 13:46.449
I need 600 million to buy the bonds.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.035
You want us to sit
on $600 million worth...

13:49.203 --> 13:50.995
of French government bonds?

13:51.163 --> 13:54.290
I'm confident on this.
It's a real sleeping beauty.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.168
- Where are you, Gene?
- At a cricket match.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.505
Somebody just hit the hell out of the ball.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.341
- Who's playing?
- Don't get technical.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.385
A bunch of men in white pants.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.512
How about it? Are we in or out?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.973
Gold has to hold steady.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.976
Bernard Sachs is already in
for $300 million.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.644
Feel better?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.355
You are going to make me
an old man.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.358
A rich old man, Gene. A rich old man.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.736
A $600 million deal.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.739
Sherman's commission
would be $1.7 million.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.658
All in a day's work.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.994
He was there! At the top!

14:31.245 --> 14:33.371
Impervious, untouchable...

14:33.664 --> 14:35.707
insulated by wealth and power.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.876
A Master of the Universe.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.379
A great height
from which to view the world.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.048
A great height from which to fall.

15:12.912 --> 15:18.541
Sherman, you are an absolute angel
coming all the way out here.

15:18.792 --> 15:23.546
I had to talk to you.
I did a very stupid thing.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.549
Are we going to talk about it now?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.593
I'm afraid we have to.

15:28.802 --> 15:33.264
Sherman, don't you want
a little poontang first?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.102
I know it has its funny side,
but it isn't funny.

15:38.395 --> 15:42.065
It's your own fault
for getting caught like a red herring.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.817
You mean red-handed.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.947
Can't we stop talking
about your wife now...

15:49.239 --> 15:55.453
and head over to our little hideaway
on 59th Street and just hide away a little?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.205
I think she knows.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.791
Of course she knows. That's not the point.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.250
It isn't?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.754
Oh, God, Sherman, you are so sweet.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.967
I could eat you alive if I could get
this goddamn zipper down.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.096
- Isn't that the turnoff?
- Where?

16:13.263 --> 16:14.722
The turnoff to Manhattan?

16:14.890 --> 16:17.141
I can't get over right now.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.061
We'll just exit and get back on.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.064
- Exit and get back on.
- Oh, no, Maria. Maria.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.440
- Maria!
- What?

16:32.825 --> 16:36.035
Sherman. Where are we?

16:36.370 --> 16:37.870
The Bronx.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.539
What does that mean?

16:39.707 --> 16:41.791
It means we're north of Manhattan.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.963
All I need to do is make a right
and find a street back.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.761
And there it was.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.888
A simple wrong turn.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.725
Anyone could have done it.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.351
A simple phone call...

17:00.519 --> 17:03.229
a simple wrong turn,
and you're off the track...

17:03.397 --> 17:06.273
moving towards a destiny
you never imagined.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.710
- Sherman?
- Yes, Maria.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.712
Where are all the white people?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.470
Are they going to scratch the car?

17:37.389 --> 17:38.765
Get a job.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.144
I'm from the South
and I don't like this very much.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.688
Excuse me.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.899
Please don't touch the car.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.442
Thank you.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.904
Get us out of here.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.947
I have a red light.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.494
Hey, baby!

17:59.661 --> 18:01.079
We're having a party!

18:03.290 --> 18:04.957
Maria!

18:09.254 --> 18:11.923
Go, Sherman, go...

18:12.549 --> 18:14.884
Get us out of here!

18:18.263 --> 18:21.182
I want my money.
I want my money now!

18:33.237 --> 18:35.321
There was no need to panic.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.573
That's what you think.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.118
I have all my luggage with me.

18:40.285 --> 18:44.330
I just don't want to do anything stupid.
If we keep our heads, we'll be fine.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.250
We're in the middle of a war zone...

18:47.459 --> 18:50.378
and you're worried about
doing the right thing?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.631
Look. An arrow!

18:53.799 --> 18:56.425
Right there. It's an arrow!

18:56.593 --> 18:57.718
I see it.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.762
Then turn!

18:59.972 --> 19:01.055
I'm going to.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.733
There's the ramp
back to Manhattan. See?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.153
What's that?

19:17.447 --> 19:18.781
It's a body!

19:18.949 --> 19:20.283
It's an animal!

19:20.450 --> 19:21.617
Is it dead?

19:21.785 --> 19:23.661
It's a tire, that's all!

19:23.829 --> 19:27.540
- It's a dead tire?
- Calm down! It's just a tire!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.756
What are you doing?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.634
I can't drive around it.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.387
You're going to move it?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.849
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.519
Sherman, be careful of your shoes.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.633
Sherman, come on.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.306
Touching that dirty old tire.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.309
Oh, yuck.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.187
I just want to get out of here.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.981
I want to get to Manhattan.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.983
Come on, Sherman.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.988
Oh, my God.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.574
Oh, my God.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.159
Natives!

20:45.327 --> 20:46.452
Oh, my God.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.329
Sherman! Sherman!

21:04.012 --> 21:05.680
Yo. Need some help?

21:07.015 --> 21:08.140
No.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.852
No, thank you. Hi!

21:13.689 --> 21:16.232
What's the problem? Need help or what?

21:16.400 --> 21:22.154
No. I don't think so. No. Thank you.
Very much. No.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.828
Shit.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.454
Shit!

21:31.081 --> 21:32.790
Sherman, come on!

21:46.805 --> 21:47.805
Sherman.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.770
Well, excuse me. I have to go.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.277
Where are you going with the tire?

22:04.740 --> 22:07.950
This is yours? Oh, then here, you take it.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.745
Damn.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.833
Oh, my God!

22:16.001 --> 22:17.793
Get in the car, quick!

22:20.005 --> 22:22.173
Here they come! Lock the door!

22:22.758 --> 22:25.593
- Drive.
- Open the door!

22:25.761 --> 22:29.513
- Get away! Get away!
- Careful. Look out!

22:31.266 --> 22:33.309
- Okay. Oh!
- Back up!

22:33.477 --> 22:36.896
- Open this door.
- Get away from the car! I can't see a thing!

22:40.776 --> 22:43.235
- Oh, my God!
- Watch out!

22:43.403 --> 22:45.780
- Stop!
- Okay!

22:47.115 --> 22:48.699
Go, car!

22:50.035 --> 22:53.245
Hey, stop! Bitch, open this door!

22:53.413 --> 22:56.499
Hey! Hey! Stop!

22:56.666 --> 22:57.875
Hey!

23:00.337 --> 23:02.129
Where's the ramp?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.175
What are we doing here?

23:06.343 --> 23:08.302
Just make a left.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.639
A left? Okay, a left.

23:46.007 --> 23:51.220
Sherman, fuck the luggage.
Let's go have a drink.

23:54.808 --> 23:55.808
Come on.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.646
- Maria.
- Oh, Sherman.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.983
Maybe we should tell
the police about this.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.276
The police?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.737
Yes, the police.
We were almost robbed.

24:11.408 --> 24:16.245
There's a possibility that you...
that we hit one of them.

24:16.413 --> 24:21.709
There was this sound,
like we hit one of them.

24:22.043 --> 24:24.211
Did you see him get hit?

24:24.379 --> 24:26.922
- No.
- No.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.091
Neither did I.

24:29.384 --> 24:33.554
So, if a question ever arises,
two boys blocked the road.

24:33.763 --> 24:37.099
They tried to rob us, and we got away.
That's all we know.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.769
But if we call the police now,
then we're not...

24:41.062 --> 24:44.398
Let's call them and invite them
to our little love nest.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.400
They'd love to get us.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.404
The police, the press
and all the rest of the "mediarites."

24:51.114 --> 24:53.741
Mediarites?

24:53.909 --> 24:58.412
The newspapers, radio, television.
I can see it now.

24:58.580 --> 25:04.460
"Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue,
and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue...

25:04.628 --> 25:08.464
are recuperating after their adventures
in the Bronx."

25:13.762 --> 25:16.430
Explain that one to your wife.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.599
Yes, you have a point.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.313
But I'd feel better if...

25:24.481 --> 25:28.484
You don't have to feel better.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.111
I was the one who was driving.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.531
And I say I didn't hit anybody.

25:33.698 --> 25:37.117
And I'm not reporting anything
to the police.

25:37.285 --> 25:42.122
And if you're a gentleman,
you'll support me in that decision.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.876
Sherman.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.213
Sherman. Sherman.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.590
We were in the jungle.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.302
- We were attacked.
- That's true.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.180
- We fought our way out.
- We could've been killed.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.140
We fought.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.601
I feel like an animal.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.145
You drove the hell out of that car.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.816
The hard part was getting into the seat,
over that gearshift.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.568
No, it was instinct.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.486
God, and that tire!

26:12.654 --> 26:15.864
- He was big, wasn't he?
- Sherman was bigger.

26:16.032 --> 26:19.159
- You were great.
- We were both great.

26:20.870 --> 26:24.540
This could be the best sex we've had
in a long time.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.835
- I still think...
- Don't think!

26:28.044 --> 26:30.045
Just fuck!

26:34.050 --> 26:35.968
Sonnenberg?

26:38.346 --> 26:40.889
Mr. Sonnenberg?

26:41.850 --> 26:44.643
Where the hell is Mr. Sonnenberg?

26:46.229 --> 26:50.357
Mr. Lockwood, you sit down.
If and when your lawyer appears...

26:50.525 --> 26:52.818
Two to six, Judge.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.905
Two to six. Two weeks ago,
he told me two to six.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.741
Two to six, or we go to trial.

26:58.908 --> 27:01.619
- Nobody wants to go to trial.
- I'll go.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.120
Approach the bench.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.664
I'll approach the bench.

27:08.084 --> 27:12.296
Listen, you son of a bitch. You're a
nice boy, with a lot going for you.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.383
We got 7000 felony indictments
in the Bronx every year.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.470
We got room for 650 trials.
Yours isn't one of them.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.679
I go to trial.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.223
You go sit down.

27:23.391 --> 27:27.061
And you'll take whatever plea bargain
we give you.

27:27.270 --> 27:31.106
You'll kiss my ass and thank me
that I didn't put you away for 25 years.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.736
That's what you'd get if this case goes
to trial. Now get out of my face.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.415
What'd he do?

27:48.583 --> 27:53.253
Robbed and raped a 70-year-old lady
and put her in a garbage can.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.963
Jesus Christ.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.049
Welcome to the South Bronx.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.425
Next case.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.969
People versus Harold Williams.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.640
- Indictment number 294721.
- Oh, shit.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.436
This case was dismissed three weeks ago.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.938
Go get 'em, tiger.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.565
Why is this case here?

28:13.733 --> 28:15.109
Your Honor.

28:15.276 --> 28:19.238
May I approach the bench,
Your Honor?

28:19.406 --> 28:20.823
Who the hell are you?

28:23.159 --> 28:25.953
Assistant District Attorney Kramer.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.664
Mr. Kramer, you are new here.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.916
Let me explain something to you.

28:31.751 --> 28:35.170
This case is what we call a piece of shit.

28:35.338 --> 28:39.299
Which, loosely translated,
means you don't have any evidence.

28:41.136 --> 28:45.431
Except that District Attorney Weiss
has instructed me to show you...

28:45.598 --> 28:49.685
I know who the District Attorney is,
Mr. Kramer.

28:49.853 --> 28:53.313
The only reason Mr. Weiss is interested
in this case...

28:53.523 --> 28:56.191
is because Mr. Williams over there...

28:56.359 --> 29:00.362
is a white man who lives
in a nice, big house in Riverdale.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.407
I'm not following you.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.243
Because it's an election year.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.413
Ninety-nine percent of those you shovel
through this court are black...

29:09.581 --> 29:13.167
and the other ninety-nine percent
don't speak English.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.877
But they do vote.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.465
So your boss, the District Attorney,
Mr. Weiss...

29:19.632 --> 29:23.510
who dreams every night
of one day becoming mayor of New York...

29:23.720 --> 29:25.512
needs a white man.

29:25.680 --> 29:29.224
He needs to find him, book him,
and throw him in jail.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.435
Then everybody likes him.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.312
The press and voters like him.

29:34.063 --> 29:37.357
You know, even your mother would like him.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.194
- You following me?
- I am now.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.780
Now you tell your boss,
"Captain Ahab Weiss"...

29:42.947 --> 29:47.367
that I know he's out there looking
for "the great white defendant."

29:47.577 --> 29:50.370
But Mr. Williams, over there, is not it.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.167
- Don't take it personally.
- Thank you.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.377
Maybe he didn't like your shoes.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.087
- You Andruitti?
- Yeah, what?

29:59.255 --> 30:03.050
I'm Martin, this is Goldberg.
We just came from Bronx Hospital.

30:03.218 --> 30:07.054
Kid named Henry Lamb came in last night
with a broken wrist.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.431
They fixed him up and sent him home.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.893
This morning, he comes back in
with a concussion.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.896
He goes into a coma,
and now they say he'll die.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.648
Did you talk to him?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.066
- He's in a coma.
- He's in a coma.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.567
Oh, yeah.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.236
What else?

30:22.403 --> 30:24.446
There's a nurse busting my balls.

30:24.614 --> 30:28.200
Says the kid told his mother he was hit
by a Mercedes, which drove off.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.953
- Hit-and-run.
- The mother told you this?

30:31.120 --> 30:35.123
She's got a pile of parking tickets
and won't talk to the police.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.625
Why come to us?

30:36.793 --> 30:40.796
You've got an unconscious victim,
no witness, and no driver.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.466
You've got what we call a piece of shit.
Right, Kramer?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.718
What we've got is a problem.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.096
Ever hear of Reverend Bacon?

30:49.264 --> 30:52.140
Oh, no. No, not me, gentlemen.

30:52.308 --> 30:55.769
Kramer, this is all yours. See you later.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.481
Reverend Bacon?

30:59.732 --> 31:06.738
Is my living in Vain?

31:08.825 --> 31:12.119
This is a tragedy!

31:12.287 --> 31:16.498
A fine young man has been struck down.

31:16.666 --> 31:21.295
God-fearing, church-going,
never in trouble...

31:21.462 --> 31:25.465
graduated from high school,
on his way to college.

31:25.925 --> 31:30.012
Somebody comes along,
some rich white people...

31:30.179 --> 31:32.973
in a rich white man's car, and wham!

31:35.977 --> 31:40.272
They run him down and never even stop.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.194
Now, what'll we do
about these parking tickets?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.239
Well...

31:49.407 --> 31:52.492
First of all, Reverend... Is it Reverend?

31:52.660 --> 31:55.579
Is, was and always will be.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.291
First of all, we have no evidence...

31:59.459 --> 32:01.585
This is your evidence.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.965
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.177
Mrs. Lamb is not speaking to the police.

32:10.386 --> 32:13.555
Until we have proper counsel,
I'll speak for her.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.515
Fine. That's good.

32:15.683 --> 32:20.312
I just want to get a few things straight.
The boy was hit by a car?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.897
On Bruckner Boulevard.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.400
Innocently walking along
minding his own business.

32:25.568 --> 32:28.236
A clear case of hit-and-run.

32:28.404 --> 32:33.241
But there were no witnesses.
Without a witness, you have no case.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.077
You got what he told his mother.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.870
It's hearsay.

32:37.038 --> 32:41.333
You and I may believe it,
but it's not admissible in a court of law.

32:41.709 --> 32:44.544
If this boy was born on Park Avenue...

32:44.712 --> 32:47.881
and was run down by two niggers
in a Pontiac...

32:48.049 --> 32:50.258
then you'd have a case, right?

32:50.426 --> 32:52.928
I work Park Avenue
and Bruckner Boulevard.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.263
There's good and bad in both places.

32:55.431 --> 32:58.141
We'll try to help this lady...

32:58.309 --> 33:00.602
- but there's not much to go on.
- Gentlemen.

33:01.771 --> 33:04.439
I want you to make an investment here.

33:04.732 --> 33:08.485
An investment in steam control.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.779
Steam control?

33:10.947 --> 33:13.115
Steam control.

33:13.282 --> 33:17.369
A righteous steam is building up
in the souls of my people.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.122
And that steam is ready to blow!

33:20.289 --> 33:22.165
- I see.
- Now...

33:22.333 --> 33:25.460
on Judgment Day, I am your safety valve.

33:25.628 --> 33:28.422
Because when it blows, and it will...

33:28.631 --> 33:33.260
how grateful you will be
that I am on your side.

33:33.469 --> 33:38.348
The one nigger who can control
the steam and save your white ass...

33:39.017 --> 33:41.476
from being burned
off the face of the earth.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.769
So to speak.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.148
That's...

33:46.315 --> 33:49.234
Thank you. We'll see what we can do.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.111
Excuse me.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.083
Thank you.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.836
He said...

34:08.337 --> 34:12.257
He said it started with an "R."

34:12.467 --> 34:15.635
The second letter was an "E"...

34:16.344 --> 34:17.846
or a "P."

34:18.306 --> 34:22.934
Those were the first two letters
of the license plate.

34:25.646 --> 34:29.274
We should move up here.

34:30.150 --> 34:34.696
Have you ever thought about moving out
of New York?

34:34.864 --> 34:38.658
Keep a small place in town.
Save loads of money. What do you think?

34:40.328 --> 34:42.204
About what?

34:42.371 --> 34:45.456
Do you think we could leave New York?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.335
No.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.003
My father did it.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.922
You are not your father.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.676
She knew how to hurt a guy.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.388
No, he was nothing like his father.

35:00.556 --> 35:04.768
His father, "The Lion of Dunning,
Sponget and Leach."

35:04.936 --> 35:08.563
His father, who took the subway
to work every day of his life.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.733
His father, who believed
in principles and ethics...

35:11.901 --> 35:17.447
whose lessons about duty and debt
had whistled through his son's head.

35:17.615 --> 35:21.618
No. Sherman McCoy was
nothing like his father.

35:22.411 --> 35:25.413
What're you looking for
in that paper?

35:25.581 --> 35:27.916
Nothing. Nothing special.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.751
What's a bond?

35:30.044 --> 35:31.878
Sherman, do explain it.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.465
Yes, your mother and I really want
to hear this.

35:35.633 --> 35:41.179
Well,
A bond is a way of lending people money.

35:41.347 --> 35:46.184
Say you want to build a road or a hospital,
and you need a lot of money.

35:46.352 --> 35:49.688
What you do is issue a bond.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.023
Do you build roads?

35:52.191 --> 35:54.651
No, I don't actually build them.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.319
You're in over your head.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.780
Let me try.

35:58.948 --> 36:04.452
Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads
or hospitals or anything, really.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.247
Daddy handles bonds for the people
who raise the money.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.292
That's what he said. Bonds.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.960
Yes. Now...

36:12.420 --> 36:16.798
Just imagine that a bond
is a slice of cake.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.926
Now, you didn't bake that cake.

36:20.094 --> 36:23.430
But every time you hand a slice
of that cake to somebody else...

36:23.598 --> 36:25.473
a little piece comes off.

36:25.641 --> 36:27.267
Little crumbs fall off.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.936
Really. Crumbs?

36:30.646 --> 36:33.899
And you are allowed to keep those crumbs.

36:34.066 --> 36:37.819
And many a man has sold his soul
for those little crumbs.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.654
And that's what Daddy does.

36:39.822 --> 36:43.992
Daddy passes somebody else's cake around
and picks up all of the crumbs.

36:44.452 --> 36:49.915
But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs,
and a great big golden cake...

36:50.082 --> 36:52.167
and a lot of golden crumbs.

36:52.335 --> 36:57.547
And imagine Daddy running around
picking up every little golden crumb...

36:57.715 --> 36:58.924
he can grab.

36:59.091 --> 37:02.135
And that's what Daddy does.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.847
You can call them crumbs if you want to.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.433
I'm doing the best I can.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.019
Excuse me.

37:19.528 --> 37:22.864
In my day, there was some integrity to it.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.659
Yes, well...

37:25.826 --> 37:29.829
Now it isn't about anything, is it?
Except the money.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.708
Well, I don't make the rules, so...

37:33.876 --> 37:36.086
All the more reason not to play the game.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.216
We're just having a little...

37:41.384 --> 37:43.385
It's nothing really.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.351
Up to this point in our story,
I was blissfully ignorant.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.145
I had no idea of the storm
that was gathering.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.231
Never even heard of Sherman McCoy.

37:56.399 --> 38:00.777
Hadn't the faintest notion that soon
his name would be inexorably tied to mine.

38:00.987 --> 38:04.572
That his fate would be inextricably bound
to my own destiny.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.491
I had my own problems...

38:06.701 --> 38:10.954
and I had no idea that Sherman McCoy
was the solution I was looking for.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.541
You're bad.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.920
- Billy.
- Caroline.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.339
Caroline, you look beautiful!

38:21.799 --> 38:23.091
- You devil.
- You pig.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.011
- Join us for a cocktail.
- No, I'm with someone.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.680
Yes. And a pretty someone he is.

38:30.516 --> 38:33.727
Filippo Chirazzi, the artist.
Peter Fallow, the has-been.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.689
We're crowded this evening.

38:37.898 --> 38:40.734
Why don't you sit on top of Billy Cortez?

38:41.027 --> 38:43.695
I'll see if Caroline will sit on my face.

38:43.904 --> 38:48.366
No thanks. The last time I sat on your face
I got a yeast infection.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.747
Good evening, Peter.

38:55.624 --> 38:56.916
Good evening.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.711
Don't get up. Do you know my daughter?

39:00.921 --> 39:03.631
Of course. How are you, Evelyn?

39:03.799 --> 39:05.925
This is one of my invisible employees.

39:06.093 --> 39:10.555
One of the many journalists
who supposedly write for my newspaper.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.724
You're very honored to see him.

39:13.726 --> 39:14.851
I rarely do.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.731
I can explain. Come have a drink...

39:19.899 --> 39:22.567
We're having a private party.

39:22.735 --> 39:26.237
I was at a dinner last evening,
and halfway through the pudding...

39:26.405 --> 39:30.367
a 4-year-old child came in
dragging a little toy cart.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.620
And on the cart was a fresh turd.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.288
Her own, I suppose.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.583
The parents just shook their heads
and smiled.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.586
I've made a big investment in you, Peter.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.464
Time and money, and it's not working.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.634
I could just shake my head and smile.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.845
But in my house, when a turd appears,
we deal with it.

39:51.013 --> 39:54.599
We dispose of it. We flush it away.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.644
We don't put it on the table
and call it caviar.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.563
Of course you don't.
I've been working at home.

40:00.731 --> 40:05.193
I'm working on a story that I can't talk
about here. It's a big story.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.196
I sincerely hope so, Peter.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.949
- Well, it is.
- I sincerely hope so.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.577
Come along, my dear.

40:16.455 --> 40:20.291
It was the end of the road for me.
I could see it coming.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.129
See it coming? It was here.

40:24.296 --> 40:27.340
I'd had my chance and I'd blown it away
in a bottle.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.593
It was over. I had to face up to that fact.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.722
I could go back home.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.475
Small town, small newspaper.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.812
Or I could write a novel or two.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.981
Or I could slit my wrists.

40:43.232 --> 40:48.653
This last idea seemed most appealing,
as it required the least amount of effort.

40:50.322 --> 40:52.323
And then the telephone rang.

40:57.746 --> 40:58.746
Yeah?

40:58.914 --> 41:00.790
Peter! Albert Fox here.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.793
Peter?

41:04.086 --> 41:05.587
Peter!

41:06.464 --> 41:09.007
- Hello, Peter?
- Yeah, this is Peter.

41:09.383 --> 41:11.384
You sound terrific.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.678
Any pulse?

41:14.889 --> 41:19.559
I called the paper. No one knew
where you were or who you were.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.519
Anything I should know?

41:21.687 --> 41:24.272
No, I'm just working at home today.

41:24.523 --> 41:28.693
Good. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.196
There's a hell of a story in it.

41:31.363 --> 41:34.449
Meet me at NBC, studio 4H, 7:00.

41:34.617 --> 41:35.742
Ciao.

41:36.410 --> 41:40.163
Yeah. Ciao.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.584
You see that Henry Lamb material?

41:44.752 --> 41:46.628
Yeah, I looked at it.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.338
What do you think?

41:48.756 --> 41:50.215
What do I think?

41:50.382 --> 41:53.718
I think it's an unfortunate situation.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.595
Where's the goddamn story?

41:55.763 --> 42:00.058
A poor, innocent black kid
walking down the street...

42:00.309 --> 42:03.770
and boom. Hit-and-run.
There's a story in it for somebody.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.814
The black community's up in arms.

42:06.982 --> 42:10.902
And when Reverend Bacon gets a feather
in his ass, the shit flies high.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.907
What's your angle on all this?

42:16.075 --> 42:18.159
What do you stand to get out of it?

42:19.078 --> 42:23.581
- I'm a lawyer. I want justice done.
- Come on, Albert.

42:23.749 --> 42:27.168
Reverend Bacon is my friend.
It'll be good for him.

42:27.336 --> 42:31.256
And knowing your situation,
I thought if you broke the story...

42:31.423 --> 42:32.924
Wait a minute.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.095
What do you mean, my situation?

42:40.266 --> 42:43.268
Your boss was at my house for dinner.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.270
He said a few things.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.023
I see.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.571
- You have a little daughter?
- Yes, I do.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.698
I bet she has a toy wagon.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.700
Yes, she does. Why?

42:58.867 --> 43:00.493
Got any scotch in that car?

43:01.495 --> 43:03.580
Henry Lamb. Who's that?

43:03.789 --> 43:07.292
He was a student of yours
at Ruppert High.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.168
He was? What's he done?

43:09.461 --> 43:12.338
Nothing. He's been seriously injured.

43:12.506 --> 43:14.465
I'm a newspaper reporter.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.217
I don't remember him.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.386
What kind of student was he?

43:18.554 --> 43:21.848
If I don't remember him,
I guess he was okay.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.683
Was he a good student?

43:24.476 --> 43:28.813
Good doesn't apply at Ruppert High.
They're cooperative or life-threatening.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.859
- Wasn't he going to college?
- City College.

43:33.027 --> 43:38.031
If you live in the city, graduate high
school, and breathe, they take you.

43:39.908 --> 43:44.329
What about his performance in class?
Any aptitude, special skills?

43:44.496 --> 43:47.498
- Fallow. Peter Fallow.
- Mr. Fallow, I got 65 students in each class.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.376
Tests, homework, any written work?

43:50.544 --> 43:54.672
There hasn't been written work
at Ruppert High for 20 years.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.049
Really?

43:56.216 --> 43:58.718
How do you keep track of the kids?

43:58.927 --> 44:01.721
There must be some records.

44:02.014 --> 44:05.058
You're thinking about
honor students and grades.

44:05.225 --> 44:09.062
We don't make those comparisons.
We just try to keep them off the streets.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.189
At Ruppert, an honor student...

44:11.357 --> 44:15.693
is somebody who comes to class
and doesn't piss on the teacher.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.533
By that standard...

44:22.701 --> 44:25.495
was Henry Lamb an honor student?

44:25.788 --> 44:27.664
Well...

44:27.956 --> 44:29.415
He never pissed on me.

44:29.750 --> 44:34.796
No, you're exaggerating
the situation. The franc is no problem.

44:34.963 --> 44:40.593
We can hedge that to next January,
to the term or to both, whatever.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.513
I don't think that's necessary.

44:46.892 --> 44:50.395
Look, Bernard, we've had our share of...

44:50.562 --> 44:56.609
Hell, I wouldn't even call them problems,
so let's not work ourselves up...

44:56.777 --> 44:59.112
into a coma.

44:59.405 --> 45:01.406
Jesus Christ, let me see that!

45:01.615 --> 45:03.366
No, not you, Bernard.

45:06.912 --> 45:08.287
Yeah.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.753
Wait. What the hell are you talking about?

45:16.422 --> 45:19.757
No, we can't wait.
We have to move on this thing now.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.635
Bernard, you're...

45:23.679 --> 45:25.805
You're bringing up phantom issues!

45:26.098 --> 45:29.267
We must pull ourselves together
and fucking do it!

45:29.435 --> 45:30.601
Look!

45:30.811 --> 45:33.104
Bernard. Bernard!

45:33.272 --> 45:35.857
But it was too late. It was gone.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.942
Oh, Jesus.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.654
Six hundred million dollars.

45:41.822 --> 45:46.951
On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was
a dead salesman. And Sherman knew it.

45:49.913 --> 45:53.666
Sherman. Hi.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.043
You know what?

45:56.295 --> 45:59.297
I was just thinking of you.
Where have you been?

45:59.465 --> 46:01.090
Have you seen this?

46:01.300 --> 46:03.676
- Don't I get a kiss first?
- Have you read it?

46:03.844 --> 46:07.972
You know I only read
the newspapers spasmodically.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.932
Sporadically?

46:10.100 --> 46:12.310
Maria. Maria.

46:12.644 --> 46:17.482
Who is this Peter Fallow
character? He's got it all wrong!

46:17.816 --> 46:20.818
Excuse me, but what is going on here?

46:21.153 --> 46:25.198
I'm installing a new intercom system.
Super let me in.

46:25.365 --> 46:28.326
Are you Caroline Heftshank?

46:29.953 --> 46:31.746
I need you to sign a receipt.

46:31.914 --> 46:35.541
I don't live here.
I'm a guest of Miss Heftshank.

46:35.709 --> 46:38.836
- Just a guest. Okay.
- Yeah.

46:39.004 --> 46:40.963
No problem. I'm all done.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.341
Good. Thank you.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.512
- That was close.
- What's going on?

46:47.721 --> 46:51.933
Oh, I don't know. Caroline pays $300 rent
for this place.

46:52.100 --> 46:55.686
It's rent-controlled. I
sublet it for $1100.

46:55.896 --> 46:58.105
But it's not legal.

46:58.273 --> 47:01.609
To get Caroline out,
they have to prove she doesn't live here.

47:01.777 --> 47:06.239
Isn't it weird that he came here today?
After that piece in the paper?

47:07.491 --> 47:11.744
Oh, Sherman.
You are completely "paranoidical."

47:11.912 --> 47:15.915
I have to leave for the airport
in about 20 minutes.

47:16.625 --> 47:19.710
So we don't have much time.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.257
Do you think they could trace
the car to me?

47:24.424 --> 47:27.552
How? They don't have
the full number or a witness.

47:27.719 --> 47:31.889
The only person who could recognize you
is in terminal "comatosis."

47:32.057 --> 47:35.226
But the other fella.
Suppose he comes forward?

47:35.644 --> 47:38.896
If he was going to materialize,
he would have by now.

47:39.147 --> 47:42.567
And he hasn't because he's a criminal.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.444
What a wretched painting.

47:45.612 --> 47:48.531
It's a Filippo Chirazzi.
He's a friend of Caroline's.

47:48.699 --> 47:52.410
- Know him?
- I hope not. God, that looks like you.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.829
No. How could it?

47:56.748 --> 48:01.252
- Where are you going?
- The airport. The car's coming soon.

48:01.461 --> 48:04.922
We have time for a quickie.
What do you say?

48:05.090 --> 48:06.340
Maria.

48:07.092 --> 48:11.429
I've lost $600 million today.
Possibly my job.

48:12.097 --> 48:14.974
I don't feel terrifically
sexy at the moment.

48:18.437 --> 48:21.606
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.

48:21.773 --> 48:23.900
You are incorrigible.

48:24.067 --> 48:26.903
Am I?

48:28.196 --> 48:33.284
I suppose we could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.

48:33.452 --> 48:36.287
And put our heads right
into the tiger's mouth?

48:36.955 --> 48:39.206
I'm the one who was driving the car.

48:39.458 --> 48:43.169
Shouldn't I be the one
to make that decision?

48:43.337 --> 48:47.673
And I say no. I say no.

48:47.841 --> 48:49.842
Trust me.

48:50.010 --> 48:54.055
Nothing will come
of that little newspaper article.

48:54.222 --> 48:56.766
Absolutely nothing.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.355
Thanks be to God

49:02.522 --> 49:06.943
The morning light of peace

49:08.987 --> 49:10.821
Over there. I'll be right with you.

49:10.989 --> 49:13.491
The storm is passing over

49:13.867 --> 49:16.202
Mr. Fallow. Our hero.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.245
Reverend Bacon.

49:18.413 --> 49:22.208
I feel as we already know each other.
And Mr. Corsaro.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.960
Nice to see you again.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.837
You have an exclusive. Understand?

49:27.214 --> 49:31.175
I could've had every newspaper
and TV station spreading this news.

49:31.343 --> 49:36.097
But I have chosen only
you two. And I expect big coverage.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.849
In-depth coverage.

49:39.017 --> 49:40.267
Let's get to work.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.602
Let's go.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.358
Look, Reverend.

49:47.526 --> 49:51.696
Might we be making a mountain
out of a molehill? Honestly...

49:51.863 --> 49:54.073
Honesty has nothing to do with this.

49:54.366 --> 49:58.369
This is show business. I've never known
the two to go hand in hand.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.706
Neither have I.
And I'm supposed to be a journalist.

50:01.873 --> 50:04.500
You're a drunk. That's what I heard.

50:04.876 --> 50:08.379
And you're almost out of a job.
Or am I misinformed?

50:08.547 --> 50:09.964
You have the wrong man.

50:10.132 --> 50:12.299
No, I don't think so.

50:12.467 --> 50:14.218
I don't think so at all.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.679
TV's ready, Reverend.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.640
Okay, man.

50:19.808 --> 50:24.520
Stay in the wide shot.
Push in when you see the action.

50:25.313 --> 50:27.898
The storm is passing over

50:28.066 --> 50:29.483
He's something, isn't he?

50:29.651 --> 50:30.776
He sure is.

50:30.944 --> 50:34.280
He's on the level with this one, right?
The story's legitimate.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.448
Of course.

50:35.615 --> 50:37.283
This Henry Lamb's a nice kid.

50:37.451 --> 50:40.411
The neighbors like him. No record.
Honor student.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.413
No question about it.

50:42.622 --> 50:47.001
Personally, I don't care. But, when I finish
with this story, the kid'll be a saint.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.211
Be nice to know it's true, that's all.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.629
It's true.

50:51.423 --> 50:54.425
We're rolling the cameras. Go ahead.

50:55.427 --> 50:56.677
The storm is

50:59.931 --> 51:02.266
Brothers and sisters...

51:02.434 --> 51:07.980
I stand before you
with a heart that is broken.

51:08.148 --> 51:13.986
And I stand before you
with a heart that is angry.

51:14.154 --> 51:17.573
It's heartbroken because our brother...

51:17.741 --> 51:21.619
our neighbor, our son, Henry Lamb...

51:21.787 --> 51:26.749
has been struck down
in the prime of his young life.

51:26.917 --> 51:32.797
And now he lies in a hospital,
broken, like my heart.

51:32.964 --> 51:35.508
But I tell you, my heart is also angry.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.384
Yes! Angry!

51:37.636 --> 51:42.014
Because the driver
of that car didn't do nothing for him!

51:42.390 --> 51:44.391
And neither did the police!

51:44.643 --> 51:48.020
And neither did this man!

51:48.188 --> 51:49.897
Mr. Abraham Weiss.

51:50.148 --> 51:53.859
That's my name. My own fucking name.

51:54.694 --> 51:57.238
That's a complete fuck-up.

51:57.989 --> 52:01.867
- Who the hell are you?
- Assistant District Attorney Kramer.

52:02.035 --> 52:03.619
I work in this office.

52:03.912 --> 52:07.123
And I, for one, am not gonna stand for it.

52:07.415 --> 52:08.415
No, sir.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.168
In response, Israel today appealed
for patience...

52:11.336 --> 52:12.711
General accounting office said...

52:12.879 --> 52:15.714
Sources at Motor Vehicles say...

52:15.882 --> 52:18.592
less than 200 Mercedes have plates...

52:18.760 --> 52:23.347
beginning with "RE," "RB," or "RP."

52:23.515 --> 52:26.976
How did they get this information
out of Motor Vehicles?

52:27.144 --> 52:30.271
Calm down. We've had this information
for over a week.

52:30.647 --> 52:34.233
Why aren't we doing anything about it?
Why aren't we tracing the car?

52:34.401 --> 52:36.402
Actually, I suggested we...

52:36.570 --> 52:39.488
What am I? The Wizard of Oz?

52:39.656 --> 52:44.326
Trace the car? Trace the car?
We don't even have a witness.

52:44.494 --> 52:47.788
We don't know where it happened,
or even if it happened.

52:47.956 --> 52:49.165
Trace the car.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.835
We don't have a case,
even if we find the car.

52:53.295 --> 52:57.006
If we found the driver,
and the driver came to us and said:

52:57.174 --> 52:59.800
"Yeah, that's right."

52:59.968 --> 53:03.971
I hit this kid the other night,
and I didn't stop.

53:04.139 --> 53:08.642
I didn't report it. I'm the guy. I did it."
Then we got a case.

53:08.977 --> 53:11.187
Just trace the fucking car.

53:19.154 --> 53:21.822
Yesterday, I was
a respected Jewish liberal.

53:22.657 --> 53:26.327
Ten minutes of news like this,
and now I'm a hymie racist pig?

53:28.830 --> 53:31.040
The Italians are going to love this.

53:31.208 --> 53:32.666
The Irish too.

53:33.501 --> 53:34.835
And the WASPs.

53:36.588 --> 53:39.673
They love this shit more than anybody.

53:40.008 --> 53:41.717
They love laughing at me.

53:42.510 --> 53:44.261
All the rich sons of bitches.

53:44.429 --> 53:46.555
They still think they own this town.

53:46.723 --> 53:51.977
They sit in their co-ops, Park Avenue,
Fifth, Beekman Place, snug like a bug.

53:52.145 --> 53:55.022
Twelve-foot ceilings, a wing for them,
one for the help.

53:55.190 --> 53:56.774
They think money'll protect them.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.400
You stupid sons of bitches!

54:03.907 --> 54:08.118
I'd like to light a fire under their
white asses. Let them see how it feels.

54:08.286 --> 54:11.538
Let the Third World see the smoke
and come after them!

54:12.040 --> 54:17.378
Let them feel what it's like when every
Puerto Rican, West Indian, Cuban, Korean...

54:17.545 --> 54:21.131
Albanian, Filipino, black man
from every borough...

54:21.299 --> 54:24.218
The future knows how to cross a bridge!

54:26.388 --> 54:28.097
You laugh.

54:28.265 --> 54:31.642
You laugh! All right!
Here's what we're going to do!

54:31.935 --> 54:35.271
We're going to turn this thing around
if it kills us!

54:35.563 --> 54:38.649
We'll prove to these black motherfuckers...

54:38.942 --> 54:40.442
Pardon my language.

54:40.652 --> 54:46.282
We'll prove to these niggers
that this administration loves them!

54:46.449 --> 54:48.575
No matter what it takes.

54:48.743 --> 54:52.121
I am no racist hymie.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.372
By November...

54:54.457 --> 54:57.793
they are going to be
thinking of me as...

55:00.088 --> 55:03.173
the first black district attorney
of Bronx County.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.634
Yeah.

55:06.094 --> 55:08.929
They're going to beg me to be mayor.

55:09.097 --> 55:11.807
- We'll walk away with that election.
- No question!

55:11.975 --> 55:14.601
- That's what we'll do!
- Yes!

55:15.270 --> 55:20.107
If we have to screw every white asshole
from Albany to Park Avenue, we will!

55:29.492 --> 55:31.410
- No.
- Like people...

55:31.578 --> 55:33.162
Here he comes now.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.080
- Tony, hi.
- It's Eddie, sir.

55:35.248 --> 55:37.708
I'm Detective Martin,
this is Detective Goldberg.

55:37.876 --> 55:41.337
We're investigating a car accident.
Maybe you heard about it.

55:42.797 --> 55:44.298
Yeah.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.092
Yes! On television.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.345
Last night. My wife...

55:49.596 --> 55:54.058
We said, "We have a Mercedes
and the license starts with 'R."'

55:54.225 --> 55:55.601
You and a lot of people.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.019
Going up?

55:57.228 --> 55:59.688
Yeah. Yes, yes, I will.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.523
Should we...?

56:01.691 --> 56:04.234
- Is it bad time for you?
- No, no...

56:07.030 --> 56:09.365
- We just have a few questions.
- Oh, yes.

56:09.532 --> 56:12.451
- Was your car in use the night it happened?
- When?

56:12.619 --> 56:14.078
Tuesday, a week ago.

56:14.245 --> 56:16.080
Let me think.

56:16.247 --> 56:18.207
Anybody else use your car?

56:18.416 --> 56:20.250
My wife sometimes.

56:20.543 --> 56:21.794
The men at the garage.

56:21.961 --> 56:25.005
Parking garage? You leave your car
and they park it?

56:25.215 --> 56:27.424
Can we go see it?

56:28.760 --> 56:30.427
The car? Now?

56:30.637 --> 56:34.264
Since we're here.
There's certain things to look for.

56:34.557 --> 56:37.393
We don't find them, we're out of your hair.

56:37.644 --> 56:40.104
- So you want to look at the car?
- Yeah.

56:40.271 --> 56:42.064
I see. I see.

56:42.273 --> 56:47.236
We don't have a description of a driver,
so we have to look for the car.

56:47.570 --> 56:51.031
We're sorry for the inconvenience,
but it's routine.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.449
I understand.

56:52.617 --> 56:57.996
But if there is a routine,
then I ought to follow the routine...

56:58.164 --> 57:02.042
that's appropriate to me,
to someone with a car in this situation.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.252
You see?

57:04.421 --> 57:06.380
No, I don't follow.

57:06.548 --> 57:10.676
If there's a routine
in an investigation like this...

57:10.927 --> 57:15.639
there must also be a routine
for a person like me.

57:15.807 --> 57:18.684
For the owner of a car
with a license number.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.811
That's what I need to consider.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.313
The routine.

57:24.482 --> 57:26.692
We just want to look at your car.

57:27.610 --> 57:29.820
That's what I mean. You see?

57:30.697 --> 57:31.905
No.

57:32.323 --> 57:34.867
Excuse me, Mr. McCoy.

57:35.285 --> 57:36.994
Do you want to tell us something?

57:37.579 --> 57:38.579
No.

57:39.330 --> 57:41.457
No. How do you mean?

57:41.958 --> 57:45.294
I mean, if there is,
now is the time to tell us.

57:45.462 --> 57:47.171
Before things get complicated.

57:47.338 --> 57:48.881
No, no, no...

57:49.048 --> 57:51.967
I just think that to be certain...

57:52.218 --> 57:55.137
to be safe, sure, I think...

57:57.807 --> 58:01.810
If you want to cooperate, that'd be great.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.606
If you have a reason not to cooperate...

58:06.149 --> 58:09.651
you don't have to say anything.
That's your right.

58:09.819 --> 58:13.071
If you want, you can say nothing at all.

58:13.239 --> 58:15.824
You also have the right to an attorney.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.577
For that matter...

58:18.745 --> 58:21.497
if you lack funds for an attorney...

58:21.664 --> 58:25.334
the state will provide you
with one free of charge.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.127
If that's what you wanted.

58:28.171 --> 58:30.881
Well look...

58:31.049 --> 58:35.177
I think what I should do is...

58:36.554 --> 58:38.347
talk to an attorney.

58:39.599 --> 58:42.017
So I casually read him his rights.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.937
Then he sits down on the guy's desk.

58:45.104 --> 58:48.565
And his eyes get bigger
and he starts double-talking like crazy.

58:48.733 --> 58:50.734
I know that there's something there.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.653
Mr. Weiss, I think we got him.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.031
Got who?

58:56.282 --> 58:58.283
Sherman McCoy. We got him.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.035
You think it's him?

59:00.703 --> 59:03.372
It's him! This guy is Park Avenue.

59:03.540 --> 59:08.168
His father ran Dunning, Sponget and Leach.
His wife is a socialite.

59:08.336 --> 59:10.754
Does this put an end
to this white-justice shit?

59:10.922 --> 59:12.714
We have zip on him.

59:12.882 --> 59:16.885
We could bring him in for questioning,
then go public.

59:17.053 --> 59:21.390
Go public? With what? The only
witness is in a coma, likely to die.

59:21.558 --> 59:24.434
Don't listen. You got a speech to make.

59:24.602 --> 59:27.062
Send a signal to the poor people
of the city.

59:27.230 --> 59:28.939
Let them know justice is blind.

59:29.107 --> 59:33.277
Let them know that rich whites
get the same treatment as poor blacks.

59:33.444 --> 59:35.571
You must give the people hope.

59:36.239 --> 59:38.657
You mean, we nail the WASP?

59:38.825 --> 59:40.409
To the wall.

59:42.829 --> 59:44.621
I like this man.

59:46.165 --> 59:48.750
So I tell him,
"I'm your lawyer from Legal Aid."

59:48.918 --> 59:53.005
He says, "I don't want a nigger lawyer.
I want a Jew."

59:53.256 --> 59:54.298
Nice guy.

59:54.465 --> 59:59.177
- It's his third drug arrest. He wants a deal.
- He'll say he was at the scene?

59:59.345 --> 01:00:01.972
He'll say whatever you want him to say.

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:06.935
Get me Andruitti. Tell him it's urgent
about this Lamb shit.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:12.107
Suppose this other fellow comes forward.
There was another fellow. He was big...

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:17.154
I believe you. It was a set-up.
They were going to rob you.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:19.948
He has good reasons not to come forward.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.284
Now, you just sit tight.

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:27.456
Look, you were recommended
as the best criminal lawyer around.

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:30.125
But I didn't come here to...

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.880
I want to preempt this situation.
I don't want it to go any further.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.548
What does that mean?

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.884
I want to take the initiative.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.553
I want to go to the police with Maria...

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:44.681
with Mrs. Ruskin,
and tell them what happened.

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:48.644
I feel morally certain
that what we did was right...

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.854
in the circumstances we were in.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:56.276
Yeah, you Wall Street honchos
are real gamblers.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.030
What are you, nuts?

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:03.158
They will devour you.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.494
- Eat you alive.
- Why?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.996
Forget that it's a political football.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.749
Forget about the TV and Reverend Bacon...

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.835
and Weiss's upcoming election.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:18.507
Remember that every day, the Bronx DA
prosecutes people with names...

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.302
like Tiffany Latour, Sancho Rodriguez...

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.764
Chong Wong and Shabazz Tamali.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:31.186
So he's dying to get his hands on a nice
white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.397
I mean, Biscuit City.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:36.024
Open your mouth and they will arrest you.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:40.779
They will make a big show of the arrest.
It will be very unpleasant. Guaranteed.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.158
And you don't want to be arrested
in the South Bronx.

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.037
Yeah.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.039
Put him on.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.083
I'll hold.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.961
I'll need to talk to Mrs. Ruskin too.

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.548
I understand you went to Yale.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:02.050
Yeah. You too?

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.970
What did you think of it?

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:08.390
It was okay, as law schools go.

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:11.226
They give you the scholarly view.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:16.565
And it's good for anything you want to do
that doesn't involve real people.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:23.280
Andruitti, you guinea bastard!

01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:26.241
Yeah? Well...

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.661
I'm sitting here with Mr. Sherman McCoy.

01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:32.414
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:37.919
I don't know if he needs a lawyer.
What do you think?

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.424
Okay. So what does that mean?

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.468
Yeah, sure.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:49.848
Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.143
We got a problem.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.228
What is it?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.522
They're going to arrest you.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:03.612
While Sherman faced catastrophe
in his career and in his marriage...

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.908
and while the police were circling,
while his life hung in the balance...

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:10.494
Sherman went to the opera.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.143
There he is...

01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:21.523
Don Juan in the vise-like grip of fate...

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:26.152
facing his crime, facing his entire life
of selfish consumption...

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.030
and profligate wasting
of himself and others.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.994
You're Judy McCoy's husband.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.204
Yes.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.415
Have you met Aubrey Buffing, the poet?

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.710
He's up for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.921
- Oh.
- We were talking about the opera.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:47.549
The wrath of heaven must be at hand.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.968
Its justice will not tarry.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.514
I see the deadly thunderbolt
poised above his head.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.601
Suddenly, he saw her in the crowd.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.728
Maria.

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:02.981
- And even when repentance...
- Excuse me.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.569
He followed her past the grinning faces
full of boiling teeth.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.529
Past the conversational bouquets.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.949
Past the impeccably emaciated
ladies of society.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.243
The social X-ray women.

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:18.496
Christ, was this the world he lived in?

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:22.000
Before he answered the question
he saw Maria being introduced...

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.252
to his wife.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.681
Maria's just back from Italy.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.475
She lives on airplanes.

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:41.645
She goes back and forth
from Italy like a Ping-Pong ball.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.773
Judy?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.441
Sherman.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.195
Have you met Nunnally Voyd?

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.906
- At last.
- How do you do?

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.825
- Bobby Shalfet from the opera.
- Oh, yes.

01:05:55.993 --> 01:05:57.535
- Hi.
- How do you do?

01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:59.454
And Arthur Ruskin.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:01.623
- How do you do?
- Ciao.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.084
And his wife, Maria.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.628
- How do you do?
- We've met.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:15.845
Couldn't you try just once
to be a little bit interesting?

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:18.640
I wanted you to meet Aubrey Buffing.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.602
Aubrey Buffing.
He's on the short list for the Nobel Prize.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.396
He has AIDS. You'll love him.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:26.439
Sherman.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:30.443
We are in the middle of the room,
a married couple talking to each other.

01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:34.864
You simply don't do it. Go mingle. Please.

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:39.369
And even when
repentance is offered, he refuses.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.663
He refuses to deny his life.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.166
The food, the drink, the flesh...

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:49.170
fatal as they may be,
he cannot resist them.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.693
Maria, may I speak to you?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.737
We have to stop meeting like this.

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:15.989
- Do you know Boris, the ballet dancer?
- No.

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:18.491
- Boris Karlevskov, Sherman McCoy.
- Hello. How do you do?

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.079
- He's defective.
- You mean, he defected.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:25.749
No, I mean he doesn't speak English.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.001
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.086
- Do you know what's going on?
- Watch.

01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:32.714
Boris, want me to eat your ass?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.927
You see? It went right over his head.

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:41.222
- We have to talk.
- Of course we do.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:44.476
But keep smiling because
my husband is watching.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:48.104
See? He's so pleased with himself.

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:53.651
He's just closed a new deal.
Charter business. He'll fly Arabs to Mecca.

01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:57.238
- I'm going to be arrested.
- The planes are from Israel.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:58.782
By the police.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.242
He'll make a goddamn fortune.

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.869
My lawyer, if you can call him that...

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:07.624
He called me a whore today.
Right in front of the servants.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:12.253
Really. How does he expect me
to run the house...

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:15.924
- If he humiliates me in front of the help?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.885
- You have a point.
- Oh.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.223
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.935
The other guy's come forward.
Says I was driving.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:30.438
I'm going to be arrested tomorrow.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:34.442
I need to know from you
what you want me to say.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.822
Maria, darling, I need your advice
about something.

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:41.741
Sherman, have you met Aubrey Buffing?

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.121
Like so many of us...

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:52.042
until Death itself takes us into his arms
and burns us with the fever of living...

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:56.798
dragging us like Don Juan
into the bonfires of hell.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.676
The voice of the ghost ringing in our ears.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.929
"Repent. Repent!"

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:21.698
Good morning. Careful. My kid got Styrofoam
shit back there and it sticks to your clothes.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.825
- How do you feel?
- Top notch.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.743
This is just a formality, right?

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:27.871
No problem. They promised me.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:33.209
I told Maria. I saw her last night.
In case we need her.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.379
That explains it.
She left the country this morning.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.674
You know an Italian painter
named Filippo Chirazzi?

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:44.345
I think your girlfriend's
got a new boyfriend.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.348
It won't be so bad. This is routine.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.518
Andruitti promised we'll be in
and out of there.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:52.770
No one will ever know what happened.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:54.647
Cuff him.

01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:56.065
What?

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:58.818
The zone captain will be there.
And the press.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.696
What the fuck? What press?

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.032
Ray promised no bullshit.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:08.119
Weiss gave the order this morning.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.705
Somebody's going to pay for this.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.381
I made sure I was there that day.

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:23.218
That day would be full of revelations.

01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:25.762
I would meet Sherman McCoy at last.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.056
When he finally appeared...

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:32.060
Well, excuse me, what the hell...?

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:35.563
Who were these people?
What were they doing here?

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.106
This was my story!

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:40.485
Sherman McCoy was my baby! My creation!

01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:52.789
Come on! Give us a statement!

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.625
Look at these punks.
Get out of here!

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.460
Why'd you hit that kid?

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.963
Put the cuffs on him.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.175
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:08.096
Don't say a word. Don't hide your head.

01:11:08.305 --> 01:11:10.473
You don't even know they're there.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.725
- I'm going to jail.
- Come on.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.906
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Over here.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.033
You been arrested before?

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:31.786
Where's your wife?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:35.790
You ran down Mrs. Lamb's son.
Have you anything to say to her?

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.043
Here! Let me take your picture, shithead!

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:42.213
How do you like this cocktail party?

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:47.218
Hello, Mr. McCoy.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:50.638
Don't make any statements!
Don't talk to anybody!

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.182
I'll meet you at the arraignment.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.269
- Don't make any statements!
- Move it. Come on, move it.

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:42.023
Murderer!

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:45.193
Order!

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:58.915
Order! Order!

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:03.878
Quiet! You people sit down!

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.380
Shut up!

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:10.927
Sit down. Everybody, sit down.

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:23.147
Mr. McCoy...

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:25.775
do you know the charges
that have been brought against you?

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:29.737
What?

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.700
How do you plead to the charges?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.080
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:44.001
I am very sorry. Please forgive me.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:47.672
- Oh, come on.
- Order!

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:54.095
I am truly sorry for everything.
Please forgive me.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.764
For my life. For everything.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.433
I'm truly sorry.

01:13:59.476 --> 01:14:00.643
Shut up.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.854
The defendant pleads not guilty.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:04.647
What?

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:09.861
Bail has been set at $10,000.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.284
Order! Order!

01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:20.746
You people sit down! Sit down!

01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:22.248
Your Honor.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.584
Your Honor.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.794
Your Honor.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.883
We do not believe it will serve
the interests of justice...

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:35.219
to allow this man to walk free...

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.472
on a token bail.

01:14:39.349 --> 01:14:44.687
Mr. Kramer knows perfectly well
that my client won't jump bail!

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:46.564
Think of the emotions of this community!

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:57.909
That is patent nonsense.
Bail has already been agreed to.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:04.874
Mr. Weiss has instructed me to ask
for bail in the amount of $250,000.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:06.375
Cash!

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:10.546
Order!

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:19.430
If your office has any information
bearing on bail status of this case...

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.724
make a formal application.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.101
Meanwhile, I release Mr. McCoy...

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.646
under a bond in the amount of $10,000.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:29.315
Now get this sideshow out of my court!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.816
Your Honor.

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:36.864
Your Honor, your action will irreparably
damage not only the people's case...

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:38.491
I have spoken!

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.619
But the people's cause as well.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.787
Mr. Kramer!

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.623
It ill-behooves the
criminal justice system!

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.583
Kindly behoove me no "ill-behooves."

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.418
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Kramer.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:52.046
The court directs you to shut up!

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:00.596
He's coming out the back!
Fall out! He's coming out the back!

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.265
Go get him!

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.976
Get him.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.479
He's getting away!

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.735
He's getting away.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.494
Pshew.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.457
So much for my introduction
to Sherman McCoy.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:32.003
Before we could even speak,
he had been swept away.

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:36.757
I began to appreciate the power,
the magnitude...

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:40.303
the sheer force unleashed
by my little story.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.640
Jackals.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.642
These dogs...

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.520
yapping at the heels of their prey.

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:52.148
And, my God, I was one of them.

01:16:52.649 --> 01:16:55.318
Let them have it. Enough is enough.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:59.155
With what little dignity I had left,
I decided to go home.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:09.790
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find a taxi?

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.215
Sherman McCoy.

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:20.134
Yeah, I know who you are.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.558
- What are you doing out here?
- I need a taxi.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.935
There he is! There's McCoy!

01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:36.567
You need to get out of here. Come on.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:40.196
Come on. We'll get out of here
on the subway.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:44.325
- I don't usually travel in the subway.
- Well, me neither...

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.176
I owe you an apology.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:04.345
No, you were very helpful.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.515
- You don't know who I am.
- It's all right. Thanks.

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.934
Listen.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.602
I should go.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.312
Go where? You're on a train.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.065
- Well, I'll just...
- Here, come here.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:18.275
Come over here and sit down.

01:18:18.443 --> 01:18:20.027
Sit down.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:24.407
I'll make sure you get home.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.380
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.798
Come on. Fuck it.

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:42.925
What'll they do?

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:44.552
Arrest you?

01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.979
Thank you.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:19:00.651
Does this train go
anywhere near Park Avenue?

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.321
Not for the last million years.

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:09.827
Well, my father rode the subway
every day of his life.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:15.207
He didn't live in the South Bronx, though.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.961
No. No.

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:21.797
I look terrible.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.717
You look like shit.

01:19:25.969 --> 01:19:28.596
You don't smell good, either.

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:37.354
I think when I was in jail
I pissed in my pants.

01:19:51.077 --> 01:19:52.703
Take it easy.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.830
I'm all right.

01:19:56.082 --> 01:19:57.458
I can't think.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.835
Cheer yourself up.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.681
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:23.025
Then this newspaper thing started.
This Peter Fallow.

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:27.029
Everything was wrong.
Total disregard for the truth.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.614
This is your stop.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:33.369
Everyone calls me by my first name,
like they know me. Like they own me.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:38.415
Lawyers, police, newspapers.
How did I get to be so important?

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.753
You're not important. You're dinner.
Don't you get it?

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:47.383
A week from now,
they won't even remember what they ate.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.552
Thank you for everything.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:54.640
I should have just called the police
right away. Right when it happened.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:58.143
But it really wasn't my decision to make.

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:00.104
I wasn't driving the car.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.024
Stand clear of the doors, please.

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.944
Sherman, wait a minute!

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.112
Excuse me. Sherman!

01:21:11.783 --> 01:21:13.951
It's going to be fine.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:56.118
- What do we want?
- Justice!

01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:57.953
- What do we get?
- Racism!

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:21.518
It's Sherman! A bravo, everybody!

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:39.328
You sly fox. Don't let the newspapers
keep you down.

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:41.664
The press are bloody fruit flies.

01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:43.832
They hover over the feces.
Just swipe them away.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.168
But they always come back to the shit.

01:22:47.712 --> 01:22:49.588
I always thought you were dull.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:51.423
Excuse me.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:57.054
Sherman. Congratulations.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.766
Has anybody talked to you
about television?

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:04.228
We'd have to play down the racial thing.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.772
Kind of make you more sympathetic.

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:12.361
I know I'm first, but I wanted to be there
before the corpse was cold.

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:13.946
Two hundred grand.

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:16.573
- I beg your pardon?
- Fuck my pardon.

01:23:16.866 --> 01:23:19.243
I'll suck your dick for the rights.
Two-fifty.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:23.580
A book, a mini-series. Half a million.
Go to jail, double.

01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:26.875
- Is that a great blow job or what?
- Excuse me!

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:30.212
Hey, Sherman.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:33.382
Oh, Rawlie, hi. Hi.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.926
- Didn't mean anything to interrupt anything.
- Oh, no, no.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.887
- Gene asked me to come by.
- No. Oh, Gene.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:41.265
I haven't talked with anyone yet.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:44.727
- If there's anything we can do...
- Oh.

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:47.896
I'll be back to work in a day or two.

01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:52.067
That won't be necessary.
That's what I was sent to...

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:53.819
You don't have to.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:57.406
I mean, you shouldn't come down.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.659
They don't want you to come down.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.954
- Oh. Oh.
- Sherman, I'm sorry.

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:07.291
Between this and the way you handled
the Giscard deal...

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:10.586
- I mean, $600 million is a...
- This is final?

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:14.089
Well, the firm feels that...

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.300
I'm sorry.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:38.030
Judy, could we...? What's going on?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:42.993
This dinner party was planned weeks ago,
if you bothered to check your calendar.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.622
Under the circumstances...

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:50.125
I know the whole story.
I saw it on television.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:54.463
- Television.
- I'm sorry. Judy, I am.

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:59.218
You betrayed us. Me. Campbell.
Even yourself.

01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:04.223
But I'm chairing the museum benefit
thanks to your escapades.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:06.517
What can I say? Life goes on.

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.853
I'll make the best
of an appalling situation.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.648
Can you forgive me?

01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:20.989
I suppose I can forgive anything,
but not television.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.659
I'm leaving you.

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:27.996
After the party.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:31.667
Now if you will excuse me,
we have guests.

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.379
No... Judy. No, Judy, please.

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:39.550
I'm terribly sorry to bother you.
Is this a bad time?

01:25:41.427 --> 01:25:43.679
Pollard. No.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.389
The more the merrier.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.350
I've been in touch with the co-op board.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.395
We want you to know
you have our support.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:53.063
Oh, thank you.

01:25:53.356 --> 01:25:55.357
You know, I wanted to die...

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:58.944
with everybody calling my name
in that courtroom.

01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:01.113
Of course. It's hard to believe.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:05.367
And then I thought, "I have a gun."

01:26:06.202 --> 01:26:08.203
A 12-gauge, pump action.

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:10.455
We've known each other a long time.

01:26:10.623 --> 01:26:13.750
We went to Buckley together.
My father knew your father.

01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:16.753
I speak as a friend and also for the board.

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:19.256
How do I get the barrels into my mouth?

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:22.092
How am I going to pull the trigger?

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.596
I read about a man who took off his shoe...

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.307
and pulled the trigger with his toe.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:33.228
This can't be a comfortable situation
for you.

01:26:36.482 --> 01:26:37.482
Is that a gun?

01:26:40.778 --> 01:26:42.487
Where would I do it?

01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:45.490
And who would find me?

01:26:45.658 --> 01:26:47.409
Yes, exactly.

01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:49.411
Have you considered...

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:52.581
changing residence for a while?

01:26:55.793 --> 01:26:57.419
You want me to leave?

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:59.004
Well...

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.342
- This is my home.
- I understand that.

01:27:03.509 --> 01:27:07.804
I have no safe place to go.
People are threatening my life.

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:10.265
I must protect myself.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:17.105
People are demonstrating out front.
Black people with basketballs.

01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:19.066
You're putting everyone at risk.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:22.027
It's not your fault. But that's the fact.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.821
If you're so scared, you move out.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:26.782
Please.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:28.533
Start...

01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:31.954
by moving out of my apartment now.

01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.748
I came here in good faith.

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.124
Now, out!

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.921
You were a fat blowhard at Buckley...

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.048
and you're a fat blowhard now!

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:46.343
I'll enforce the provision
on unacceptable situations.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:50.973
Another word and you'll have
an unacceptable situation up your ass!

01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:53.767
March!

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:03.193
That goes for the rest of you too! Out!

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:17.833
I said, get out!

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:21.586
Parasites! Everybody out!

01:28:21.879 --> 01:28:25.215
Out of my house! Out of my apartment!

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:29.177
Out of my life!

01:28:34.517 --> 01:28:37.227
Sherman McCoy is dead!

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:41.440
Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue
and Wall Street...

01:28:43.192 --> 01:28:48.322
will never be Sherman McCoy again!

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:58.123
Meanwhile, just a few blocks away,
I was being praised and congratulated.

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:01.752
It should have been
a triumphant yours truly...

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:03.337
but it wasn't.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:07.716
My encounter with the real
Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything.

01:29:08.384 --> 01:29:10.010
Truth has a way of doing that.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.720
Daddy, dinner.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:15.891
- Yes. Shall we take Peter with us?
- Lovely.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:19.061
Pay full attention to this story.

01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:22.731
We look better and better
the more we do for the Lambs.

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.275
These poor little Lambs.

01:29:25.568 --> 01:29:27.444
These fuzzy-wuzzy little wogs!

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:29.404
Oh, Daddy.

01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:31.990
- Excuse me, Peter.
- Yes?

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:35.577
- Phone call for you in the office.
- Oh.

01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:39.623
Thank you. I'm expecting a call
about the story.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.584
I'll see you at dinner. Thank you.

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:01.686
Where's the phone?

01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:03.313
I lied.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:05.899
I wanted to see you alone.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.320
I'm going to do you a favor.

01:30:10.696 --> 01:30:14.491
Does this mean I'll finally get
into your panties?

01:30:16.994 --> 01:30:19.579
You don't deserve this, Peter.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.376
I'm going to tell you something.

01:30:24.544 --> 01:30:27.295
I'm with some people right outside.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.966
Relax, darling.

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:35.804
Do you remember...

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:40.809
my pretty little Italian friend?
The painter.

01:30:40.977 --> 01:30:42.352
Yes.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.230
Frederico. No. Franco.

01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:46.898
- Filippo.
- Filippo.

01:30:47.066 --> 01:30:48.525
The shit.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:52.821
Caroline. You are very intoxicated.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.573
Well...

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:59.744
Filippo has run off with a little slut
you should know about.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.666
Isn't that dangerous?

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:09.129
At the very least, unsanitary?

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.714
Shut up, Peter.

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:12.841
You're not listening.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:18.054
Her name is Maria Ruskin.

01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:21.558
She was subletting my apartment.

01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:28.356
She was also subletting Filippo.

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:32.360
As it turns out...

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:38.033
she was in the car with Sherman McCoy
when he had his little mishap.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.537
You're joking.

01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:44.372
I never joke.

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:49.085
She was in the bloody car.

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:52.923
How do you know?

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.552
The apartment was bugged.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.388
They had a wire in the intercom.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:05.227
They wanted to prove
I wasn't living there.

01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:08.063
Which I wasn't.

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:13.610
Now I've lost the apartment
and the boyfriend.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:18.365
Do you know where they are?

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:21.409
No.

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:28.458
I am trusting you to find them.

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:33.630
When you do...

01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:36.258
give them this.

01:32:38.135 --> 01:32:41.930
Tell them it's from the little twat
who turned them in.

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:47.310
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Mr. Ruskin.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.853
Peter Fallow.

01:32:49.021 --> 01:32:51.648
I'm a good friend of your wife.

01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:53.483
My wife. My wife.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:57.320
I'm glad she's not here.
Otherwise I couldn't have a drink.

01:32:57.488 --> 01:33:01.324
Jacques. A Courvoisier VSOP.
Put it in a sidecar.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:02.617
Where is Maria?

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:05.370
Italy. She's always in Italy.

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:08.164
She's young. She needs young people.

01:33:08.332 --> 01:33:10.166
I know what goes on.

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:12.377
I'll want to talk to her.

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:14.796
My office has her number.

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:16.631
- Voilà, Monsieur Ruskin.
- Thank you.

01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:20.760
I'm not supposed to drink,
but I love a sidecar.

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:23.597
- So you're on The City Light?
- Yes.

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:28.059
We're profiling the new tycoons.
Naturally, we thought of you.

01:33:28.227 --> 01:33:30.729
Good. Good. I like that.

01:33:30.896 --> 01:33:33.773
New tycoons. What do you want to know?

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:38.403
The best one happened
a few weeks ago.

01:33:40.197 --> 01:33:43.700
My jackass pilot lands long
and the plane goes off the runway.

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.910
I was on the plane.

01:33:46.078 --> 01:33:49.706
We were going to Mecca.
The plane is full of Arabs with animals.

01:33:49.915 --> 01:33:54.377
Goats, sheep, chickens. They don't
go anywhere without their animals.

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:58.715
We had to put plastic in the cabins.
They urinate, they defecate.

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:04.471
Anyway, the plane goes off the runway
and lands into that sand with a jolt!

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:09.309
The right wing tip digs into the sand
and spins around in a circle.

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:13.772
Three hundred and sixty degrees.
I'm scared shitless. Panic!

01:34:13.939 --> 01:34:18.234
I look in the cabin. In
there, calm, quiet...

01:34:18.402 --> 01:34:21.404
they're picking up their luggage
and animals...

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:25.116
and looking out the window
at a little fire on the wings.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:28.912
They're waiting for the doors
to open like nothing happened!

01:34:29.121 --> 01:34:30.830
Then it dawns on me.

01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:32.916
They think it's normal!

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:37.087
That's how you stop a plane!

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:40.507
Stick the wing in the sand
and let it spin until it stops!

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:49.182
They'd never been on a plane before!
What do they know?

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.976
They think this is how you do it!

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:02.320
Mr. Ruskin?

01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:06.324
Mr. Ruskin?

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.121
Mrs. Ruskin?

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:14.791
I'm Peter Fallow.
I want to express my sympathies.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.668
How very kind.

01:35:17.002 --> 01:35:18.628
Did you know Arthur?

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:21.881
Actually, I was quite close to him
when he died.

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:28.805
You know, I have reprobated myself
over and over again for not being there.

01:35:28.973 --> 01:35:32.142
I understand that
you're Sherman McCoy's lover.

01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:33.560
Excuse me?

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:38.356
And that you were driving the car
on the night of that unfortunate accident.

01:35:38.524 --> 01:35:42.360
- Sherman would never tell you that.
- Tell me what happened that night.

01:35:42.528 --> 01:35:45.238
Listen, Mr. Peckerhead.

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:48.700
I am here for my husband's funeral.
Understand?

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:53.329
Go away. Disappear. Disintegrate.

01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:59.377
Yes, yes, yes.
This story was getting better every day.

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:01.004
I could smell it.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:03.590
Hell, some of it was even true.

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:08.553
I was back on track.
I was a reporter again.

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.603
You're a muckraking yellow journalist!

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:21.441
You print this story without so much
as a by-your-leave to me or the Reverend.

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:23.318
Who do you think you are?

01:36:23.486 --> 01:36:25.445
For chrissakes, calm down.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.364
You have to keep your voices down.

01:36:30.367 --> 01:36:34.412
Sherman McCoy was not driving the car.
I think I can prove it.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.580
So what?

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:39.584
This is our case. Right here.
The hospital is the guilty party.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:41.377
The hospital?

01:36:41.587 --> 01:36:45.715
The hospital. A young man comes in
with a cerebral concussion.

01:36:45.883 --> 01:36:47.634
They treat him for a broken wrist.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:51.971
That is our case. That is the lawsuit
we'll bring against the hospital.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:56.059
That is what we have been
working toward all this time.

01:36:56.268 --> 01:36:59.062
And you are confusing the issue.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:02.065
What about Sherman McCoy?

01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:04.108
What about the truth?

01:37:04.276 --> 01:37:05.777
Congratulations.

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:08.571
You're a reporter again.

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.408
Don't forget where your story came from.

01:37:12.743 --> 01:37:15.578
That's right. You our boy, Peter.

01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:19.082
You take care of us
and we'll take care of you.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:25.213
I promise you that is going
to be a very profitable relationship...

01:37:25.381 --> 01:37:27.048
for all of us.

01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:33.763
Annie.

01:37:36.475 --> 01:37:38.476
Annie.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:46.359
Annie, I know nothing can heal
the wound that you've suffered.

01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:52.615
But $10 million in damages
will make your grief more comfortable.

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.538
Well...

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:02.333
I could use a few things.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:09.465
I feel that the presentation of my person
should be carefully designed.

01:38:09.633 --> 01:38:12.844
I think I should have the right wardrobe.

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:17.807
So if Mr. Fox's limousine could pick me up
tomorrow morning...

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.310
I could do some shopping.

01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:23.980
Certainly.

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.735
I printed the story they wanted.

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.029
Why not?

01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:34.365
If you work in a whorehouse,
there's only one thing to be.

01:38:34.533 --> 01:38:36.409
The best whore in the house.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:40.872
And I was beginning to see
even greater possibilities in my situation.

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:44.000
They're going to sue the hospital.

01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.920
All they want is money.

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:52.216
Can you imagine using a tragedy like this
for your own selfish motives?

01:38:52.384 --> 01:38:53.885
It really is terrible.

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:56.179
Shut up, asshole.

01:38:56.805 --> 01:38:58.222
Yes, sir.

01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:04.020
What is happening to my campaign?
The People versus Sherman McCoy?

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.731
Where is my issue?

01:39:07.858 --> 01:39:09.692
Where is my cause?

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.737
Where is my hope?

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:16.032
Abe.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.494
We've got to talk to this Ruskin woman.

01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:28.711
You go to the press. Tell them we're going
to question the woman.

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:33.633
If she's the woman in the car,
she faces possible charges, etc., etc.

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.343
Okay.

01:39:37.554 --> 01:39:38.846
And you!

01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:42.433
Mr. Wise-Guy-Know-It-All-Shitface!

01:39:42.726 --> 01:39:45.728
You got us into this!
You're going to get us out.

01:39:45.938 --> 01:39:47.939
Look at me when I talk to you!

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:53.653
Go to this broad.
Tell her she's in a whole lot of trouble.

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:58.783
But if she's willing to cooperate,
if she'll say what we want her to say...

01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:00.952
we will grant her immunity.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:02.996
Yes, sir.

01:40:03.288 --> 01:40:05.289
What are you waiting for? Go.

01:40:09.753 --> 01:40:10.920
Today?

01:40:11.922 --> 01:40:14.424
Her husband's funeral is today.

01:40:16.927 --> 01:40:21.097
I don't care if today is
her mother's bar mitzvah.

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:23.099
Go to her. Now!

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.603
- Mr. Leach.
- Yeah.

01:40:27.771 --> 01:40:30.440
I hear you did some creative wiring
in the building.

01:40:30.607 --> 01:40:31.816
What?

01:40:31.984 --> 01:40:34.652
You bugged
Caroline Heftshank's apartment.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.488
In three minutes, I had what I needed.

01:40:37.781 --> 01:40:41.284
It was more than a story.
I had the makings of a book.

01:40:41.493 --> 01:40:44.537
A great book. A prize-winning effort.

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.164
All I needed was a finish.

01:40:46.331 --> 01:40:49.459
- Do you have the tape upstairs?
- I got it.

01:40:49.626 --> 01:40:52.503
I shipped off a present
to McCoy's lawyer...

01:40:52.671 --> 01:40:54.922
and waited for the fireworks.

01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:57.800
I don't feel terrifically
sexy at the moment.

01:40:57.968 --> 01:41:01.179
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.

01:41:01.346 --> 01:41:04.140
You are incorrigible.

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:06.809
That is me! That's Maria!
Where did you get this?

01:41:06.977 --> 01:41:08.352
Listen.

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:15.318
We could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:18.654
And put our heads right
into the tiger's mouth?

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:20.865
I'm the one who was driving the car.

01:41:21.492 --> 01:41:24.660
Shouldn't I be the one
to make that decision?

01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:28.372
And I say no. I say no.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.626
The apartment was wired?
It was bugged all that time?

01:41:31.794 --> 01:41:33.336
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:34.587
Who knows?

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:39.717
Whoever sent this tape is either a fan
of yours or not a fan of Maria's.

01:41:39.885 --> 01:41:41.761
Then we have this as evidence!

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:44.764
This tape is illegal. Totally illegal.

01:41:45.015 --> 01:41:47.767
The guy who did this could go to jail.

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:50.853
If this were your tape, it'd be legal.

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:52.063
But it's not.

01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:54.315
If it were my tape?

01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:57.026
If you recorded your own conversation...

01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:59.570
it would be okay.

01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:03.574
But this tape can't be used as evidence
in a court of law.

01:42:03.742 --> 01:42:05.326
Then what good is it?

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:08.121
- It gave me an idea.
- What kind of idea?

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:10.373
About what you wear to the funeral.

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:12.458
What funeral?

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.710
Please be seated.

01:42:57.921 --> 01:43:01.340
In accordance with the wishes
of Mr. Ruskin...

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:02.633
Just one second.

01:43:02.801 --> 01:43:07.972
Manny Leerman will play a medley
of Arthur's favorite songs.

01:43:14.897 --> 01:43:16.314
It's me. Sherman.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:20.693
Arthur. Arthur. Arthur.

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:26.449
Don't you know each cloud contains

01:43:26.617 --> 01:43:28.576
Pennies from heaven?

01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:30.870
Maria.

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:34.457
I need to talk to you. Can you come?

01:43:36.084 --> 01:43:39.503
Be sure that your umbrella

01:43:39.671 --> 01:43:41.756
- Is upside down
- Sherman. Sherman.

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:43.090
I'm so sorry.

01:43:43.258 --> 01:43:44.634
What are you doing here?

01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:46.385
I had to talk to you.

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:51.891
Sherman, it seems like you've been doing
all your talking to the newspapers.

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.562
I had nothing to do with it.
We didn't want your name brought up.

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.064
I see.

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.359
Maria, you have to help me.

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:03.361
How can I help you?

01:44:03.528 --> 01:44:08.741
This may sound strange,
but you could start by...

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:12.912
telling the police
what really happened that night.

01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:15.748
Sherman, you are the sweetest thing.

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:19.001
I'm not sure anybody knows
what really happened that night.

01:44:20.462 --> 01:44:22.171
Not anymore.

01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:26.968
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:44:28.887 --> 01:44:30.388
Oh, God, Sherman.

01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:34.267
There's something about funerals
that is so stimulating.

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:37.019
My panties have been wet all morning.

01:44:37.646 --> 01:44:40.398
Then I'm back on top

01:44:40.565 --> 01:44:41.899
Maria, stop.

01:44:42.067 --> 01:44:45.152
What's wrong with you?
Why are you all hunched over?

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:48.364
- What's on your back?
- My what?

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.408
This lump, this piece of metal.

01:44:50.575 --> 01:44:53.828
- That's my belt buckle.
- You don't have a buckle in the back.

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:56.414
There's subterfuge afoot.

01:44:56.581 --> 01:45:01.168
You're secreting something on your body.
I want to see what it is!

01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:06.465
A hidden microphone? A wire!

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.718
Sherman! Oh, Sherman!

01:45:09.511 --> 01:45:10.636
Sherman.

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.431
You rotten, dishonest bastard!

01:45:13.598 --> 01:45:16.517
I didn't want to do it!
You gave me no choice!

01:45:19.771 --> 01:45:21.397
Mrs. Ruskin?

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.524
Go away, whoever you are!

01:45:23.692 --> 01:45:29.113
I'm so sorry. I'm Jed Kramer,
of the district attorney's office.

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:32.867
District attorney's office.

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.497
My, my, my, Mr. McCoy.

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:42.626
I'd say your goose is
just about home-fried.

01:45:43.462 --> 01:45:46.339
I have protected you.
I have been a gentleman about this.

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:51.552
I've tried to keep your name out of the papers.
Now you must do the right thing.

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:56.766
Never. Never! Never!

01:45:57.851 --> 01:46:01.228
I hope you die and hang
in the electric chair!

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:07.902
Mrs. Ruskin, I apologize
for the intrusion...

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:09.403
He's gone.

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:12.907
I know. And I'm sorry for your loss.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.201
He just ran out the back door.

01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:19.747
- Who?
- Sherman McCoy!

01:46:20.415 --> 01:46:22.249
Jesus!

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:30.925
I'm sorry if I alarmed you,
but he was acting very strange.

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:36.180
Where are my manners?
My name is Maria Ruskin.

01:46:36.973 --> 01:46:39.266
Yes. I'm Kramer.

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.060
Jed Kramer.

01:46:42.479 --> 01:46:45.940
Jed. I'm the assistant district attorney.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.775
Bronx County.

01:46:49.152 --> 01:46:51.487
Oh. I see.

01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:54.448
What a handsome district attorney you are.

01:46:56.159 --> 01:46:59.078
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Yes, we do.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:01.872
Because if I'm going to testify...

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.084
I need to know what I should
or should not say.

01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:07.837
You can start by telling the police...

01:47:08.004 --> 01:47:09.380
what really happened that night.

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:11.799
Sherman, you are the sweetest thing.

01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:14.969
I'm not sure anybody knows
what really happened.

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.762
Not anymore.

01:47:17.389 --> 01:47:21.600
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, Sherman.

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:47.084
They weren't sure downstairs
if you were here.

01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:50.629
Well, I...

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.965
I usually come up the back way now.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:56.177
I see. May I?

01:47:57.971 --> 01:47:59.722
Yes. Yeah, sure.

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.812
It's all gone. Everything.

01:48:07.355 --> 01:48:10.191
- Yeah, Judy...
- Judy's gone too?

01:48:10.358 --> 01:48:11.775
Yes.

01:48:12.527 --> 01:48:14.737
She moves quickly.

01:48:15.363 --> 01:48:18.908
She's got a good lawyer.

01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:24.497
I'm not sure I ever really
liked her, your wife.

01:48:26.208 --> 01:48:27.416
No, of course not.

01:48:27.584 --> 01:48:32.004
Or this apartment, for
what you paid for it.

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.714
Or the furniture...

01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:38.135
Or my car, or my job,
or my clothes, my life, my money!

01:48:39.262 --> 01:48:43.682
Christ. You did not come
all the way here...

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:46.352
on a fucking subway to tell me...

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.103
I am not...

01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:52.525
at this late date, going to get
the ethics and morality speech.

01:48:52.692 --> 01:48:57.863
Not now! Not when I have to do what
I'm going to do in court tomorrow.

01:48:58.031 --> 01:49:00.824
If you came to give me that...
Jesus Christ!

01:49:00.992 --> 01:49:02.493
I came here to...

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:09.833
I don't know how to do this.

01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:15.172
You didn't call. We wanted to help.

01:49:17.592 --> 01:49:21.345
I came to say that we're here for you.

01:49:21.513 --> 01:49:25.558
You're our son and we love you.

01:49:27.602 --> 01:49:29.311
I don't mean "we."

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.605
I mean "I."

01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:34.608
I love you.

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.236
That's all.

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:41.240
Please.

01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:55.796
Well...

01:49:58.466 --> 01:50:01.051
Have you thought about
what you want to do?

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.596
Well, there's...

01:50:04.639 --> 01:50:07.141
There's only one thing I can do.

01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:10.853
I want the truth to come out
and burn every one of them.

01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:12.771
There's only one way to do that.

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:14.607
Go on the stand?

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.567
Lie.

01:50:21.156 --> 01:50:25.618
I have always been a great believer
in the truth.

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:28.704
I've lived my life as honestly as I can.

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:34.293
I believe in the truth as an essential
companion to a man of conscience.

01:50:34.502 --> 01:50:38.964
A beacon in this vast and dark wasteland
that is our modern world.

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:40.466
And yet...

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:43.510
Yes?

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:49.725
In this case,
if the truth won't set you free...

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:53.145
then lie.

01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:03.739
Did this incident take place
on the ramp to the expressway...

01:51:03.907 --> 01:51:06.784
or on the avenue itself?

01:51:06.951 --> 01:51:09.662
On the avenue. Right on the street.

01:51:11.665 --> 01:51:15.709
Was there a barricade,
or an obstruction of any kind...

01:51:15.877 --> 01:51:18.462
that forced the car to stop?

01:51:19.464 --> 01:51:22.675
No, there was nothing like that at all.

01:51:25.095 --> 01:51:26.136
Well...

01:51:26.304 --> 01:51:28.347
Just one last question.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.476
Who was driving the car
when Henry Lamb was hit?

01:51:36.815 --> 01:51:40.442
Sherman never let anyone drive his car.

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:48.992
So Sherman McCoy was driving the car?

01:51:52.997 --> 01:51:54.331
Yes.

01:51:58.336 --> 01:52:02.840
Lock him up! Bang it shut!
Lock him up! Bang it shut!

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:06.677
Chill, everybody. Chill!

01:52:07.846 --> 01:52:10.055
And there it was.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:12.766
The end of Sherman McCoy.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.186
It wasn't the ending I was hoping for.

01:52:16.354 --> 01:52:20.482
All my work, all my efforts,
down the tubes.

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:24.987
My hero was gone. Finished.

01:52:25.321 --> 01:52:28.907
Maria might as well have put a gun
to his head and pulled the trigger.

01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:31.618
She and everyone in this courtroom.

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:35.539
I saw a wave of triumph wash over them.

01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:39.418
I could feel them rising like the tide
as Sherman sank before them.

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:44.548
The Master of the Universe was
going down for the third time.

01:52:44.716 --> 01:52:46.383
It was all over.

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.427
There was no hope now.

01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:51.597
The darkness closed in around him.

01:52:51.765 --> 01:52:54.808
And then I noticed a peculiar thing.

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.688
Sherman was smiling.

01:52:59.856 --> 01:53:01.982
You people settle down!

01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:04.568
I will have you all thrown out!

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.238
You are out of order!

01:53:10.074 --> 01:53:12.117
Order in here! Order!

01:53:13.536 --> 01:53:15.621
We never...

01:53:16.414 --> 01:53:17.623
Order!

01:53:22.796 --> 01:53:24.463
Go on, Mrs. Ruskin.

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:27.466
And I wanted...

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:32.095
to report the incident,
but he wouldn't let me.

01:53:32.263 --> 01:53:34.181
He said that he was driving...

01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:37.851
and that it was his decision to make.

01:53:39.604 --> 01:53:43.649
And did that surprise you?

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:46.318
I was shocked.

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:51.907
There are certain qualities of virtue
that I admire in a human being.

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:55.786
Virtues that I hope I possess myself.

01:53:55.954 --> 01:53:59.414
We have time for a quickie.
What do you say?

01:54:06.756 --> 01:54:09.675
I don't feel terrifically
sexy at the moment.

01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:14.054
You know I'm a sucker for
a soft dick, Sherman.

01:54:16.724 --> 01:54:18.684
You are incorrigible.

01:54:20.979 --> 01:54:25.023
We could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.693
And put our heads into the tiger's mouth?

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:29.862
I'm the one who was driving the car.

01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:36.702
- Give me that tape!
- Get the hell out of here!

01:54:37.245 --> 01:54:39.496
Order! Order!

01:54:41.082 --> 01:54:42.624
Order!

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:51.258
Order in here, goddamn it! Order!

01:54:56.347 --> 01:54:58.098
Approach the bench.

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:02.394
Now, gentlemen.

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:08.358
Damn it.

01:55:09.694 --> 01:55:11.486
That can't be used.

01:55:27.879 --> 01:55:29.713
- Whose tape is this?
- Mine.

01:55:29.881 --> 01:55:31.298
- Your Honor...
- Shut up!

01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:38.430
Mr. McCoy.

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:42.309
I remind you that you are still under oath.

01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:44.895
Now...

01:55:46.564 --> 01:55:49.274
Did you record this conversation?

01:55:50.735 --> 01:55:52.444
Yes, sir, I did.

01:55:53.237 --> 01:55:55.489
I recorded the conversation on this tape.

01:55:55.657 --> 01:55:57.366
My tape. This is my tape...

01:55:57.533 --> 01:55:59.284
of my conversation.

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:02.079
I recorded it.

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:13.674
Get out of my face.

01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:16.677
All of you!

01:56:19.347 --> 01:56:22.140
You can't let them get away with this!

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:25.143
Order! Order!

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.730
Order in the court!

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:35.320
You insist on testing
the will of this court?

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:37.614
Now shut up and sit down!

01:56:51.129 --> 01:56:52.295
Very well.

01:56:53.423 --> 01:56:56.425
In the case of
The People v. Sherman McCoy...

01:57:00.805 --> 01:57:04.099
based on the evidence contained
in this recording...

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:09.980
I order the indictment dismissed
in the interest of justice.

01:57:13.276 --> 01:57:15.402
Justice? Justice?

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:19.865
You call that justice?
That's not justice, you racist pig!

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:23.410
- Racist?
- Yeah.

01:57:27.498 --> 01:57:30.751
- You dare call me racist?
- Yeah!

01:57:34.672 --> 01:57:36.506
I say unto you...

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.886
what does it matter
the color of a man's skin...

01:57:41.179 --> 01:57:42.304
if witnesses...

01:57:42.472 --> 01:57:44.556
Perjure themselves?

01:57:45.183 --> 01:57:46.391
If a prosecutor...

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:49.227
enlists the perjurers?

01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:52.397
When a district attorney...

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:55.233
throws a man to the mob...

01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:57.861
for political gain?

01:57:58.529 --> 01:58:01.239
When men of the cloth...

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:06.495
men of God...

01:58:07.205 --> 01:58:09.664
take the prime cuts?

01:58:16.089 --> 01:58:17.464
Is that justice?

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:27.140
I don't hear you.

01:58:32.063 --> 01:58:35.065
I'll tell you what justice is.

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.901
Justice...

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.570
is the law.

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.949
And the law...

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:47.953
is man's feeble attempt...

01:58:48.121 --> 01:58:52.916
to set down the principles of decency.

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:56.086
Decency.

01:58:57.421 --> 01:58:59.589
And decency is not a deal!

01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:06.012
It isn't an angle, or a
contract or a hustle.

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.307
Decency...

01:59:16.274 --> 01:59:20.902
Decency is what
your grandmother taught you.

01:59:25.116 --> 01:59:27.284
It's in your bones.

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:33.456
Now you go home.

01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:43.008
Go home and be decent people.

01:59:46.137 --> 01:59:48.346
Be decent.

01:59:58.024 --> 02:00:00.483
Mr. McCoy, you're free to go.

02:00:03.237 --> 02:00:04.654
No!

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:06.990
I don't fucking believe this.

02:00:09.243 --> 02:00:11.328
Shit. Damn.

02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.253
So we come to the end of our story.

02:00:20.963 --> 02:00:23.757
That was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy.

02:00:23.925 --> 02:00:25.967
The last anyone saw of him.

02:00:26.135 --> 02:00:27.385
He was gone...

02:00:28.095 --> 02:00:31.806
in a blaze of glory.
A hero for our times.

02:00:31.974 --> 02:00:35.602
Or as close to a hero
as we're likely to get these days.

02:00:48.282 --> 02:00:52.661
And now, without further ado,
the man of the moment.

02:00:52.828 --> 02:00:54.871
The winner of the Pulitzer Prize...

02:00:55.039 --> 02:00:58.041
the National Book Award
and every other prize you can win.

02:00:58.209 --> 02:01:01.336
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Peter Fallow.

02:01:24.485 --> 02:01:28.655
Sherman, who started with
so much, lost everything.

02:01:28.823 --> 02:01:30.615
But he gained his soul.

02:01:30.825 --> 02:01:33.827
Whereas I, who started with so little...

02:01:33.995 --> 02:01:35.829
gained everything.

02:01:35.997 --> 02:01:39.833
"But what does it profit a man
if he gains the world and loses..."

02:01:40.334 --> 02:01:41.960
Well.

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:44.296
There are compensations.
