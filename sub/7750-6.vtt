00:00.005 --> 00:01.979
Previously on
"Devious Maids"...

00:02.013 --> 00:04.197
We can prove Flora Hernandez
found out she was pregnant

00:04.215 --> 00:05.865
just before she was murdered,

00:05.883 --> 00:07.500
- and my client wasn't the father.
- Mom, it's me.

00:07.534 --> 00:08.885
I remembered something.

00:08.919 --> 00:10.253
Of course he will pay,

00:10.304 --> 00:11.554
because it's on video.

00:11.589 --> 00:14.174
We need to find a way to stay together
for Tucker's sake.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.142
And if that means changing
the rules of our relationship,

00:16.177 --> 00:17.343
I'm willing to consider it.

00:17.377 --> 00:19.562
Last night Spence told me

00:19.597 --> 00:21.231
he was willing
to have an open marriage.

00:21.265 --> 00:23.266
When a man starts talking
about having an open marriage,

00:23.317 --> 00:25.518
it's not because he wants
his wife to have a good time.

00:25.552 --> 00:27.220
Your husband's having
an affair.

00:27.238 --> 00:28.488
Do you see that man out there?

00:28.522 --> 00:30.406
- Yeah. Who is he?
- My husband.

00:30.441 --> 00:32.442
- You're going with me.
- No, I'm not.

00:32.493 --> 00:35.111
Oscar, no! Aah!

00:36.330 --> 00:37.447
I saw the way you fought
for me, Sam,

00:37.498 --> 00:39.082
but the thing is...

00:39.116 --> 00:41.534
- You don't want a relationship.
- No.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.203
What kind of fun
did you have in mind?

00:43.237 --> 00:46.122
I... haven't done that
in a while.

00:46.173 --> 00:48.124
You owe me.

00:48.175 --> 00:50.093
This new therapist is a genius.

00:50.127 --> 00:52.578
He could tell that I needed
to be on mood stabilizers

00:52.596 --> 00:55.181
within five minutes
of meeting me.

00:55.216 --> 00:57.016
It took him that long?

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:06.193 --> 01:08.478
It's not the end of the world.

01:08.529 --> 01:12.065
It is! It absolutely is!

01:12.099 --> 01:14.567
So stop trying to cheer me up!

01:14.601 --> 01:16.452
Did something happen at Armani?

01:16.487 --> 01:18.655
She couldn't fit into
the dress she wanted.

01:18.706 --> 01:21.407
And then the salesgirl
called me fat.

01:21.441 --> 01:23.609
She said you were a size 2.

01:23.627 --> 01:25.044
It's the same thing!

01:25.079 --> 01:26.946
She used to be a size zero.

01:26.964 --> 01:30.166
But years of Mexican cooking
have disfigured me.

01:30.217 --> 01:32.118
If you insult my cooking
one more time,

01:32.136 --> 01:35.121
you'll know what it means
to be disfigured by a Mexican.

01:36.590 --> 01:39.425
Um, can I, um, talk to you guys
about something?

01:39.459 --> 01:41.127
Not now, dear.

01:41.145 --> 01:44.063
I'm going upstairs and take
some aspirin and lay down.

01:44.098 --> 01:47.317
After I've gotten up and purged
the aspirin, we can chat.

01:47.351 --> 01:49.269
But this can't wait.

01:49.303 --> 01:52.021
There's a problem
with the gardeners.

01:52.072 --> 01:53.823
What sort of problem?

01:53.857 --> 01:55.908
They're refusing to work
until they get paid.

01:57.411 --> 01:59.329
I wrote them a check on Monday.

01:59.363 --> 02:00.980
It bounced.

02:00.998 --> 02:02.332
Bounced?

02:02.366 --> 02:04.417
And I just got a call
from our pool guy.

02:04.451 --> 02:06.536
His check bounced, too.

02:06.587 --> 02:10.156
Mrs. Delatour, I think we better
call your business manager.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.515
I'm calling
for Genevieve Delatour.

02:19.550 --> 02:22.302
She needs to speak
with Myron Moyer immediately.

02:22.336 --> 02:24.670
There seems to be some problem
with her account.

02:24.688 --> 02:26.389
There's no need to worry,
darling.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.142
Myron's been taking care
of my money for years.

02:29.176 --> 02:31.227
He'll figure this out.

02:31.278 --> 02:33.346
What do you mean
you can't find him?

02:35.049 --> 02:37.016
Oh, my God.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.985
"Oh, my God"?

02:39.019 --> 02:41.154
Why are you saying
"Oh, my God"?

02:41.188 --> 02:44.407
Yes. Um...

02:44.458 --> 02:45.992
I'll tell her.

02:47.411 --> 02:49.412
Zoila, what?
What's happening?

02:51.832 --> 02:53.466
Your business manager
has disappeared

02:53.500 --> 02:55.385
and taken all of your money
with him.

02:55.419 --> 02:57.587
Honey, I'm sorry,

02:57.638 --> 02:59.972
but because you gave Myron
control over everything,

03:00.007 --> 03:02.558
you now don't have a cent
to your name.

03:06.647 --> 03:09.215
Mrs. Delatour?

03:10.484 --> 03:13.552
Then I was right.

03:13.570 --> 03:16.055
It is the end of the world.

03:35.376 --> 03:37.743
Hello?

03:37.761 --> 03:39.295
Aah!

03:39.346 --> 03:41.464
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

03:41.515 --> 03:42.765
It's very, very rude.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.636
You know what else
is rude?

03:46.687 --> 03:48.604
Breaking into people's homes.

03:48.639 --> 03:49.772
Excuse me.

03:49.807 --> 03:51.757
I knocked,

03:51.775 --> 03:54.360
and that cute black guy said
I could borrow some eggs.

03:54.395 --> 03:56.429
But... you don't have any.

03:56.447 --> 03:57.763
That's because
the sexy brown girl

03:57.781 --> 03:59.598
hasn't gone to the store yet.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.100
Who are you?

04:01.118 --> 04:03.486
I'm Julie. I work next door,
for the Higgins.

04:03.537 --> 04:05.604
Oh. Right.

04:05.622 --> 04:07.490
I heard they hired a cook.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.376
Actually, I'm a chef.

04:10.411 --> 04:11.627
What's the difference?

04:11.662 --> 04:14.547
$60,000 in tuition.

04:14.581 --> 04:16.582
And a hat.

04:16.616 --> 04:20.168
I studied at the Cordon Bleu
in Paris.

04:20.220 --> 04:21.387
Fancy.

04:21.422 --> 04:23.789
So where am I gonna get
some eggs?

04:23.807 --> 04:27.260
Did the Cordon Bleu not teach
you about supermarkets?

04:27.294 --> 04:29.295
You're funny.

04:29.313 --> 04:30.513
Sort of.

04:30.564 --> 04:34.233
Uh, the problem is,
I don't have a car.

04:34.268 --> 04:35.234
Do you have a car?

04:35.269 --> 04:37.136
Why?

04:37.154 --> 04:39.405
I was thinking
you could drive me.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.441
Ah!

04:41.475 --> 04:42.742
Now you're funny.

04:42.776 --> 04:44.160
Sort of.

04:44.194 --> 04:46.412
Hey, Carmen.
I see you've met Julie.

04:46.447 --> 04:50.533
Yes. Yes. I was just saying,
"Welcome to the neighborhood."

04:50.584 --> 04:51.817
And good-bye.

04:51.835 --> 04:53.286
I'm not new
to the neighborhood.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.322
I-I used to work for
Barbara Crump over on Canon,

04:56.340 --> 04:58.124
but I had to quit.

04:58.158 --> 05:00.176
She got got a rottweiler,
and I'm allergic to dogs.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.595
And I told her
she would have to choose.

05:02.629 --> 05:05.598
Can you believe she chose
a rottweiler over me?

05:07.167 --> 05:09.385
Don't let me answer that.

05:09.436 --> 05:12.688
So, uh, Julie,
uh, do we have any eggs?

05:12.723 --> 05:14.340
No.

05:14.358 --> 05:16.609
Somebody forgot to go
to the store.

05:16.643 --> 05:18.861
Well...

05:18.896 --> 05:20.396
How about I run you over there
myself?

05:20.447 --> 05:23.950
Ah! Thank you so much.
You are so sweet.

05:23.984 --> 05:26.319
Uh, I'm gonna just run next door
and grab my wallet.

05:26.353 --> 05:29.205
Okay?

05:30.690 --> 05:32.625
So...
What do you think?

05:32.659 --> 05:34.193
- Of what?
- Of Julie.

05:34.211 --> 05:35.294
She's cute, right?

05:35.329 --> 05:38.331
I think I'm gonna ask her out.

05:50.844 --> 05:52.228
Oh, God.

05:52.262 --> 05:54.380
Don't say that.

05:54.398 --> 05:55.765
What?

05:55.816 --> 05:59.151
You took the lord's name
in vain. It's not right.

05:59.186 --> 06:01.270
What should I say?

06:01.321 --> 06:03.439
You can say...

06:03.490 --> 06:05.107
"Goodness"!

06:05.158 --> 06:07.726
After what we just did...

06:07.744 --> 06:09.111
I know.

06:09.162 --> 06:11.364
...that doesn't seem right either.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.366
But it was good, wasn't it?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.900
Ohh, it was great.

06:14.918 --> 06:17.537
What about you?

06:17.571 --> 06:19.789
How do you feel?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.675
I'm...

06:22.709 --> 06:24.594
happy.

06:24.628 --> 06:28.914
You sound surprised.

06:28.932 --> 06:31.934
After Ernesto died,
I was so sad.

06:31.969 --> 06:36.522
Then I had to leave my son
to come here.

06:36.557 --> 06:39.609
I cried every night.

06:39.643 --> 06:42.695
After a while,
I started to think,

06:42.729 --> 06:47.066
if I wasn't crying,
I was happy,

06:47.100 --> 06:49.935
'cause I forgot what
real happiness feels like.

06:49.953 --> 06:53.105
I'm happy, too.

06:55.292 --> 06:58.878
Mmm, what are you doing?

06:58.912 --> 07:00.830
Come on, Rosie.

07:00.881 --> 07:02.381
Just a little more happiness.

07:02.416 --> 07:05.334
But I got dishes to wash

07:05.385 --> 07:06.836
and floors to mop.

07:06.887 --> 07:08.921
And...

07:08.955 --> 07:12.058
Oh, God!

07:14.461 --> 07:16.729
The good news is
we've found Myron.

07:16.763 --> 07:17.847
Oh, thank God.

07:17.898 --> 07:20.766
The bad news is he's in Brunei.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.351
Why is that bad?

07:22.402 --> 07:24.153
We don't have an extradition
treaty with Brunei.

07:24.187 --> 07:26.405
So the police can't arrest him?

07:26.440 --> 07:30.776
No. No, Myron Moyer can spend
every cent of Genevieve's money,

07:30.810 --> 07:32.745
and no one can touch him.

07:32.779 --> 07:34.246
Well, what can we do?

07:40.337 --> 07:42.655
Hey there, Genevieve.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

07:42.673 --> 07:44.507
Of course, Michael.

07:44.541 --> 07:46.592
You look very dashing today.

07:46.627 --> 07:47.960
Thanks.

07:47.994 --> 07:50.296
Um, m-my law firm
is working with Interpol

07:50.330 --> 07:52.098
to try and get your money back.

07:52.132 --> 07:54.800
But...
it doesn't look good.

07:54.834 --> 07:58.671
Um... And we think you may want
to sell this house.

07:58.689 --> 08:01.440
But where would
Remi and I live?

08:01.475 --> 08:04.343
Fancy apartment?
A nice condo?

08:04.361 --> 08:05.778
- "Minium"?
- Mm.

08:05.812 --> 08:06.896
No.

08:06.947 --> 08:10.015
I like it here.

08:10.033 --> 08:12.785
But you can't afford
the mortgage now.

08:12.819 --> 08:14.654
This is America.

08:14.688 --> 08:17.206
We have safety nets.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.542
Surely there must be
some entitlement program

08:19.576 --> 08:22.294
that will help me pay
for my mansion.

08:22.329 --> 08:23.713
Well, you'd think so,

08:23.747 --> 08:26.749
but most government aid
only goes to poor people.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.551
That's not fair.

08:28.585 --> 08:31.387
They don't have the same
expenses rich people do.

08:31.421 --> 08:34.539
That's why people choose
to be poor in the first place.

08:34.558 --> 08:36.558
There's no overhead.

08:38.345 --> 08:39.595
Mom, where are you going?

08:41.014 --> 08:43.381
This man has given me stress,

08:43.400 --> 08:44.817
so I'm going to the spa

08:44.851 --> 08:47.570
to have Hans beat me with reeds
until it goes away.

08:47.604 --> 08:49.021
That's my point, Genevieve.

08:49.055 --> 08:51.941
You can no longer afford
the spa.

08:51.992 --> 08:55.361
You can't even afford the reeds.

08:55.395 --> 08:59.749
Hopefully, my relationship
with Hans is strong enough

08:59.783 --> 09:03.335
that he'll agree
to beat me for free.

09:04.871 --> 09:07.790
Why don't I just give her some
of the money from my trust fund?

09:07.841 --> 09:08.958
That should cheer her up.

09:09.009 --> 09:10.459
Actually,

09:10.510 --> 09:12.428
about your trust fund...

09:13.747 --> 09:16.098
It's gone, too?

09:18.418 --> 09:21.920
I'm so sorry, Remi.

09:45.462 --> 09:50.466
Ida, it's Marisol.
Did you get my message?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.052
I did. You said Eddie
remembered something.

09:53.086 --> 09:57.973
Yes. He once heard Flora
talking about a DVD.

09:58.008 --> 10:00.059
What kind of DVD?

10:00.093 --> 10:04.630
I'm not sure, but she was
using it to blackmail somebody.

10:04.648 --> 10:06.732
Where do you think she kept it?

10:06.767 --> 10:10.803
It's got to be somewhere
in the Powell house.

10:10.821 --> 10:12.521
It's got to be.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.833
Marisol?

10:44.771 --> 10:46.438
Have you seen my Birkin bag?

10:46.473 --> 10:48.941
It's right over there.

10:50.527 --> 10:52.728
I'm meeting my friend Genevieve
at the spa.

10:52.779 --> 10:55.531
The poor thing is having
horrible financial troubles,

10:55.565 --> 10:59.184
and I want to make sure
that she knows that I am not.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.955
Is everything okay?

11:02.989 --> 11:05.040
Everything's fine.

11:05.075 --> 11:07.076
I'm gonna go finish my ironing.

11:29.616 --> 11:32.300
Rosie!

11:32.335 --> 11:33.785
What's wrong?

11:33.803 --> 11:35.587
My silk top isn't here.

11:35.621 --> 11:37.839
That's because I didn't pick up
the dry cleaning yet.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.592
I have to look spectacular
today.

11:40.626 --> 11:42.310
Billy Bush is interviewing me,

11:42.345 --> 11:44.679
and the last thing I wanna do
is give that bitch ammo.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.964
I'm sorry.
I got a late start.

11:46.982 --> 11:49.484
Why do I have
so much Donna Karan?

11:49.518 --> 11:51.486
How many funerals can I go to?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.738
This one's nice.

11:53.773 --> 11:55.824
Whatever. Help me get ready.

11:57.777 --> 11:59.160
You know, Rosie,

11:59.195 --> 12:01.196
the house
has been a mess lately.

12:01.247 --> 12:03.415
I'm starting to think
you don't like your job.

12:03.449 --> 12:06.868
No, no. I like it very much.

12:06.919 --> 12:08.670
You should.

12:08.704 --> 12:10.839
You don't have to work
for boring people.

12:10.873 --> 12:12.507
Spence and I are celebrities.

12:12.541 --> 12:15.844
Yes.
My job is very exciting.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.712
So let's step it up a notch.

12:17.763 --> 12:20.515
No more dirty dishes
in the sink.

12:20.549 --> 12:21.850
No more dust on the shelves.

12:21.884 --> 12:24.719
I'll do better. I promise.

12:24.770 --> 12:25.854
I hope so.

12:25.888 --> 12:27.522
From what I can see,

12:27.556 --> 12:30.508
all you've done all morning
is wash my sheets.

12:41.404 --> 12:42.687
Hi.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.689
Brought you a little treat
to cheer you up.

12:44.707 --> 12:46.324
Cheer me up?

12:46.358 --> 12:49.861
No, I'm good. I'm good.
I'm... I'm great, actually.

12:49.879 --> 12:51.996
Really? 'Cause with everything
that's going on

12:52.030 --> 12:53.798
with your mom and the money...

12:53.833 --> 12:55.333
I know, right?

12:55.367 --> 12:57.001
I mean, usually you hear
your trust fund's gone,

12:57.035 --> 12:58.369
your freak out, but I'm thinking
this could be the best thing

12:58.387 --> 12:59.871
that's ever happened
to this family.

12:59.889 --> 13:01.339
Really?
Yeah!

13:01.373 --> 13:02.841
I mean, we'll move
into a smaller house,

13:02.875 --> 13:04.342
where we can talk and hang out

13:04.376 --> 13:06.895
and... and really connect,
you know?

13:06.929 --> 13:09.564
Maybe we'll move into a tent.
Have you ever been camping?

13:09.598 --> 13:11.549
Uh... no.

13:11.567 --> 13:12.767
Shut up!

13:12.818 --> 13:15.103
We are going camping.

13:15.154 --> 13:17.555
You're... taking this
really well.

13:17.573 --> 13:18.890
Well, there's no other way
to take it, girl.

13:18.908 --> 13:20.358
There's no other way to be.

13:20.392 --> 13:22.160
Okay, well,
I just wanted you to know

13:22.194 --> 13:23.828
that I'm here if you need
to talk or anything.

13:23.863 --> 13:25.830
I so appreciate that.

13:25.865 --> 13:27.499
But like I said,
I'm... I'm good.

13:27.533 --> 13:30.618
I'm really, really excellent.

13:40.429 --> 13:43.715
Marisol had
a nasty little shock today.

13:43.749 --> 13:45.517
Did she?

13:45.551 --> 13:50.421
I believe she happened upon
one of your nauseating DVDs.

13:50.439 --> 13:52.440
Which one?

13:52.475 --> 13:56.895
This exercise in voyeurism
featured the Stappords.

13:56.929 --> 13:58.596
Did Marisol say anything?

13:58.614 --> 14:00.031
Mnh-mnh.

14:00.065 --> 14:00.932
But she was hiding it
when I walked in the room.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.817
She was clearly mortified.

14:02.868 --> 14:05.770
Maybe.

14:05.788 --> 14:09.073
Maybe not.

14:09.107 --> 14:11.960
Marisol has an agenda.
We've known this for a while.

14:13.379 --> 14:14.879
Maybe she was searching for it.

14:14.914 --> 14:16.631
Why would she do that?

14:16.665 --> 14:19.384
So she could use it against me.

14:19.418 --> 14:21.836
I think it's time
to fire Marisol.

14:21.887 --> 14:23.972
I also have an agenda, Adrian.

14:24.006 --> 14:25.890
Mine is to not do housework.

14:25.925 --> 14:27.892
We can hire someone else.

14:27.927 --> 14:29.060
I finally have a maid

14:29.094 --> 14:30.478
who can cook
and conjugate English verbs.

14:30.513 --> 14:32.480
If you think I'm letting her go,
you're crazy.

14:32.515 --> 14:33.965
She wanders around this house
without any supervision.

14:33.983 --> 14:36.901
What happens if she stumbles
onto my collection?

14:36.936 --> 14:38.636
Well...

14:38.654 --> 14:40.522
First, she'll wanna
wash her hands.

14:40.573 --> 14:41.906
Pay attention, darling.

14:41.941 --> 14:43.525
If she finds those DVDs,

14:43.576 --> 14:46.578
she will tell people,
and we will be humiliated.

14:46.612 --> 14:47.862
For God sake, Adrian.

14:47.913 --> 14:49.581
The woman cleans tile grout
for a living.

14:49.615 --> 14:50.999
If you can't shield this secret
from her,

14:51.033 --> 14:53.651
you're not the brilliant
degenerate I married.

14:55.454 --> 14:59.657
Evelyn, that was precisely
the pep talk I needed.

15:22.698 --> 15:24.148
Am I interrupting something?

15:24.182 --> 15:25.900
Yeah.

15:25.951 --> 15:28.653
Okay, just as a reminder,
my room is right below yours.

15:28.687 --> 15:31.573
Sorry, I didn't... realize
we were that loud.

15:31.624 --> 15:32.574
"We"?

15:32.625 --> 15:34.158
Uh, Julie, say "hi" to Carmen.

15:34.192 --> 15:38.046
Hey, Carmen.
Don't come in. I'm super naked.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.964
Isn't this your first date?

15:39.999 --> 15:42.083
And if it keeps going this well,
we'll definitely have a second.

15:42.134 --> 15:43.534
Good night.

15:43.552 --> 15:45.536
Stop. You can't do this.

15:45.554 --> 15:47.005
Do what?

15:47.039 --> 15:48.640
Have sex with that woman.

15:48.674 --> 15:50.258
She's not up to your standards.

15:50.309 --> 15:52.209
Wait.

15:53.879 --> 15:55.013
What are my standards?

15:55.047 --> 15:57.815
I am your standards.

15:57.850 --> 16:00.217
But you don't want to date me.

16:00.235 --> 16:02.186
Well, just because
you can't have filet mignon

16:02.220 --> 16:04.656
doesn't mean that you have to
settle for fast food.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.075
For your information,
Julie is not a compromise.

16:07.109 --> 16:09.110
She's a smart, elegant woman.

16:09.161 --> 16:12.730
Sam!
My breasts are getting cold.

16:12.748 --> 16:13.998
I have to go.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.450
No! You need to stop.

16:15.501 --> 16:17.201
What do you care
who I sleep with?

16:17.235 --> 16:19.737
Well, I...

16:19.755 --> 16:20.705
I don't.

16:20.739 --> 16:22.790
Good.

16:29.765 --> 16:30.848
What's this?

16:30.883 --> 16:32.383
The ring you gave me
ten years ago.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.251
I want you to sell it.
You need the money.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.220
Zoila, it was a gift.

16:36.254 --> 16:39.090
I told you at the time
it was way too extravagant.

16:39.108 --> 16:41.059
You said hang onto it
in case of a rainy day.

16:41.093 --> 16:44.529
Well, it turns out it's
your roof that's leaking.

16:46.699 --> 16:48.866
Did I ever tell you
how I got this?

16:48.901 --> 16:51.119
It was an apology
from my second husband.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.154
- Philippe?
- Yes.

16:53.205 --> 16:55.873
I caught him sleeping
with my nutritionist.

16:55.908 --> 16:57.158
He was so ashamed,

16:57.209 --> 16:59.077
he showed up the next morning
with this ring.

16:59.111 --> 17:02.780
I screamed, "You can't buy
my forgiveness with diamonds."

17:02.798 --> 17:04.281
Then I threw it at him.

17:04.299 --> 17:06.851
The big stone scratched
his cornea.

17:06.885 --> 17:09.053
So it has sentimental value.

17:09.088 --> 17:11.689
Oh, Zoila,
I love you for offering,

17:11.723 --> 17:13.156
but I can't take this.

17:13.192 --> 17:15.259
You can't afford
to be generous either.

17:15.294 --> 17:18.179
You're broke. Remember?

17:18.230 --> 17:21.983
All this talk about money
is giving me a migraine.

17:22.017 --> 17:24.318
Can't we talk about this
next week?

17:24.353 --> 17:26.904
I won't be here next week,
sweetie.

17:26.939 --> 17:28.156
What?!

17:28.190 --> 17:29.857
You can't afford to pay me,

17:29.908 --> 17:32.076
and I can't afford
not to get paid.

17:32.111 --> 17:34.328
No! You can't leave me.

17:34.363 --> 17:35.830
I need you.

17:35.864 --> 17:38.583
What you need is
a big dose of reality.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.702
Your life has changed.

17:40.753 --> 17:42.954
You gotta start being smart.

17:42.988 --> 17:46.657
If I can think of a way out
of this mess, will you stay?

17:46.675 --> 17:47.875
I suppose.

17:47.926 --> 17:49.877
Okay. Okay.

17:49.928 --> 17:51.796
You just watch.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.931
I'm about to be smart.

17:53.966 --> 17:55.466
So...

17:55.500 --> 17:58.019
The question is,
how can I make some money?

17:58.053 --> 18:00.138
You could get a job.

18:00.172 --> 18:02.840
Honey, this is serious.
Don't make jokes.

18:02.858 --> 18:04.809
Sorry.

18:04.843 --> 18:06.343
Hey!

18:06.361 --> 18:08.780
Why don't I just get someone
to give me the money?

18:08.814 --> 18:10.681
I have a lot of rich friends.

18:10.699 --> 18:13.851
You won't once you start
asking them for money.

18:13.869 --> 18:15.453
You're right.

18:15.487 --> 18:19.741
I have to borrow from someone
who really loves me.

18:21.827 --> 18:25.630
Someone like
a rich ex-husband...

18:25.664 --> 18:27.999
Who feels guilty
about the way he treated you.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.001
Oh, Zoila!

18:30.035 --> 18:32.887
I like being smart.

18:38.074 --> 18:39.575
Carmen?

18:39.609 --> 18:42.077
Hey. What are you doing
out here?

18:42.111 --> 18:43.579
Thought you might want
a smoothie.

18:43.613 --> 18:45.948
Ah. After 6 miles?

18:45.982 --> 18:47.282
You bet.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.700
Mmm. While you're
catching your breath,

18:48.751 --> 18:50.369
can I talk to you
about something?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.421
Sure.

18:52.455 --> 18:54.423
One of your employees

18:54.457 --> 18:56.121
had sex last night...

18:56.156 --> 18:57.960
in your house...

18:57.994 --> 18:59.160
with a woman.

19:00.463 --> 19:02.297
No, no, no, no.
It wasn't me.

19:02.331 --> 19:03.548
You can put that eyebrow down.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.550
So Sam got laid.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.519
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah! Good for him.

19:07.553 --> 19:09.771
No! No! Not good.

19:09.806 --> 19:11.356
This woman that
came into your house...

19:11.391 --> 19:13.174
she's not all there.

19:14.277 --> 19:16.979
She's bald?

19:17.013 --> 19:18.113
No, she's crazy.

19:18.147 --> 19:20.065
- Really?
- Yeah. I met her.

19:20.116 --> 19:22.618
Psychotic. Or on drugs.
Or both.

19:22.652 --> 19:23.986
Either way, I think
you should tell Sam

19:24.020 --> 19:26.021
that he can't bring her
into your house.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.657
Let me tell you
a little something about Sam.

19:28.691 --> 19:30.575
He's been working here
for four years.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.027
He's been lonely
the whole time.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.529
And I'm thrilled
he's finally found someone.

19:34.547 --> 19:37.165
We should be happy for him,
not, uh...

19:37.199 --> 19:38.800
meddling in his love life.

19:38.835 --> 19:41.219
No, I-I don't care about
his love life.

19:42.505 --> 19:44.973
I just want him
to respect your house.

19:45.008 --> 19:47.142
Well, thank you very much,

19:47.176 --> 19:50.729
but I'm sure the house can
survive a booty call or two.

19:52.048 --> 19:53.348
Hi, Alejandro.

19:53.382 --> 19:55.267
Hey, Mrs. Crump.

19:57.186 --> 19:59.154
Um... excuse me?

19:59.188 --> 20:00.605
You're Mrs. Crump?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.357
Yes.
You live over on canon?

20:02.391 --> 20:04.225
Yes, I do.

20:04.243 --> 20:05.494
I'm Carmen.

20:05.528 --> 20:07.162
I work for Alejandro.

20:07.196 --> 20:08.563
Oh.

20:08.581 --> 20:12.167
I have to say, that is
one beautiful rottweiler.

20:12.201 --> 20:13.368
Why, thank you.

20:13.402 --> 20:15.587
I just love dogs.

20:15.621 --> 20:18.206
If you ever need anyone
to walk him,

20:18.240 --> 20:19.758
I'd be happy to.

20:29.552 --> 20:30.602
He's ready to see you now.

20:30.636 --> 20:32.604
Will you come this way?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.375
Mrs. Delatour.

20:53.409 --> 20:56.328
Mr. Delatour.

20:56.379 --> 20:58.630
How are you?

20:58.664 --> 21:00.448
How's our son?

21:00.466 --> 21:02.634
Remi is wonderful.

21:02.668 --> 21:05.170
You don't call him
as much as you should.

21:05.221 --> 21:06.588
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

21:09.342 --> 21:11.810
My God,

21:11.844 --> 21:14.346
you're as devastatingly
beautiful as ever.

21:14.397 --> 21:16.732
Why in the world
did we ever divorce?

21:16.766 --> 21:19.351
You kept committing adultery.

21:19.402 --> 21:21.069
Oh, that's right.

21:21.104 --> 21:22.988
You must have been
so disappointed in me.

21:23.022 --> 21:26.307
No. I knew you were French
when I married you.

21:26.325 --> 21:29.745
Yeah, still, I regret sleeping
with so many of your friends.

21:29.779 --> 21:32.364
I was able to get new friends.

21:32.415 --> 21:34.533
And then I slept
with your sister.

21:34.584 --> 21:38.370
Yes. Well, that was
a bit more awkward.

21:38.421 --> 21:40.505
Philippe...

21:40.540 --> 21:42.507
If time has taught me anything,

21:42.542 --> 21:45.260
it's how to forgive,

21:45.294 --> 21:47.796
- so consider yourself forgiven.
- Oh.

21:47.830 --> 21:49.998
I want us to be friends again.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.185
This wouldn't have
anything to do

21:53.219 --> 21:56.354
with Myron Moyer stealing
all your money, would it?

21:57.607 --> 21:59.357
So you've heard.

22:00.509 --> 22:03.195
Well, it's true.

22:03.229 --> 22:05.147
I am broke,

22:05.181 --> 22:06.531
and I need your help.

22:06.566 --> 22:09.734
But it is also true

22:09.786 --> 22:12.654
that I want you back
in my life.

22:12.688 --> 22:14.623
I've missed you, my love.

22:14.657 --> 22:17.358
I'm so glad to hear that.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.583
Do you remember this manet?

22:24.634 --> 22:26.635
Of course.

22:26.669 --> 22:28.703
You bought it on our honeymoon.

22:28.721 --> 22:32.674
It was recently appraised
at a million dollars.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.509
Would you like it?

22:34.543 --> 22:37.212
Oh, Philippe.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.381
You would just give it to me?
No strings attached?

22:40.399 --> 22:41.850
Well...

22:41.884 --> 22:44.486
I didn't say that.

22:49.325 --> 22:51.526
How'd it go?

22:51.560 --> 22:54.529
He offered me a painting
worth a million dollars.

22:54.563 --> 22:56.531
That's great!

22:56.565 --> 22:57.749
What's wrong?

22:57.783 --> 23:00.368
He offered it on the condition

23:00.402 --> 23:02.403
that I sleep with him.

23:02.421 --> 23:04.906
What?

23:04.924 --> 23:08.677
He said I was
the best he'd ever had,

23:08.711 --> 23:10.762
and it was worth
that much money for...

23:10.796 --> 23:14.799
and these are his words...

23:14.851 --> 23:18.386
another ride
on the sensual merry-go-round

23:18.420 --> 23:20.188
that is my body.

23:21.524 --> 23:24.392
So did you give him a ride?

23:24.426 --> 23:26.194
No!

23:26.229 --> 23:28.530
How can you even ask that?

23:28.564 --> 23:30.482
You're broke!

23:30.533 --> 23:32.317
I may be destitute,

23:32.368 --> 23:35.871
but I would never debase myself
just to pay a few bills.

23:35.905 --> 23:38.490
I'm sorry.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.108
I'm also very proud of you.

23:41.460 --> 23:44.663
Thank you.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.631
So...

23:46.666 --> 23:48.283
What happens now?

23:48.301 --> 23:52.287
You are going to learn
to take care of yourself.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.388
I am?

23:53.422 --> 23:55.590
And this is a good thing.

23:55.624 --> 23:57.425
It's your chance
to finally prove to people

23:57.459 --> 24:00.762
that you're more than a shallow,
spoiled Beverly Hills diva.

24:00.796 --> 24:03.231
I'm sure you can get a job

24:03.266 --> 24:04.983
selling clothes
at a fancy shop,

24:05.017 --> 24:07.686
or hostessing
at an upscale bistro.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.822
I can teach you how
to cook your own meals

24:10.856 --> 24:13.325
and wash your own clothes.

24:13.359 --> 24:15.827
And even though you'll fall
asleep exhausted every night,

24:15.861 --> 24:18.196
you will be happy
because you'll know

24:18.247 --> 24:21.249
you are finally
a productive member of society.

24:21.284 --> 24:22.500
And what are you doing?

24:22.535 --> 24:25.253
I'm starting up
the merry-go-round.

24:26.622 --> 24:28.373
But, honey...

24:28.424 --> 24:30.759
Relax. It's Philippe.

24:30.793 --> 24:32.928
And if memory serves me,

24:32.962 --> 24:35.347
the ride won't last that long.

24:46.642 --> 24:47.943
Where's Peri?

24:47.977 --> 24:50.946
She left for a costume fitting.

24:50.980 --> 24:52.280
Oh?

24:54.516 --> 24:56.651
Good.

24:56.685 --> 24:58.820
- Mmm.
- What are you doing?

24:58.854 --> 25:00.739
I must not be doing it well
if you have to ask.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.490
No. Mrs. Peri will
be back soon.

25:02.524 --> 25:04.409
So?

25:04.460 --> 25:06.911
So if I don't get my work done,
she is going to fire me.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.748
But I need to be with you.

25:13.052 --> 25:14.836
- Okay.
- Mmm.

25:14.870 --> 25:16.504
But we have to do it fast.

25:16.538 --> 25:17.922
Mrs. Peri told me
to fix the toilet in the den

25:17.974 --> 25:19.541
before she gets back.

25:19.575 --> 25:22.060
I'll have you holding
that plunger in no time.

25:24.046 --> 25:26.231
- Mmm. Thank you, Mr. Spence.
- Mmm.

25:26.265 --> 25:29.050
Ooh, just Spence.
It's quicker.

Spence?

Mr. Spence?

Mr. Spence?!

26:19.785 --> 26:21.436
<i>Madre de Dios!</i>

26:25.241 --> 26:26.941
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

26:26.959 --> 26:28.993
I think I need an ambulance.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.273
Rosie?

26:40.291 --> 26:42.442
What in God's name happened?

26:42.460 --> 26:45.295
Mr. Spence had a heart attack.

26:45.329 --> 26:48.582
What?!
But he's only 46.

26:48.616 --> 26:51.084
I'm just telling you
what the doctors said.

26:51.118 --> 26:54.004
I don't understand. What was
he doing when this happened?

26:54.055 --> 26:56.056
Huh?

26:56.090 --> 26:58.925
I mean, was he exercising?

26:58.959 --> 27:01.961
Yes. I'd say so.

27:01.979 --> 27:03.063
Mm-hmm.

27:03.097 --> 27:04.347
Mrs. Westmore?

27:04.398 --> 27:05.932
I'm Dr. Kagan.

27:05.966 --> 27:07.184
I wanna talk to you about
your husband's condition.

27:07.235 --> 27:09.236
Is he gonna die?

27:09.270 --> 27:12.189
No, no. He's in intensive care,
but he's stable.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.773
Thank God.

27:13.807 --> 27:15.075
I need to see him.

27:15.109 --> 27:17.777
Sure.
Uh, just for a moment.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.479
Can I see him, too?

27:20.781 --> 27:22.165
I'm sorry. You are...

27:22.200 --> 27:24.367
This is Rosie, our maid.

27:24.418 --> 27:27.954
Sorry, only family's allowed.

27:37.848 --> 27:39.049
Marisol.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.684
To what do I owe this pleasure?

27:40.718 --> 27:42.302
You're not due back here
till Sunday.

27:42.336 --> 27:45.722
I'm sorry. I think I left
my spare key in the study.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.057
Would you mind if I had a look?

27:48.359 --> 27:50.393
Of course not. Be my guest.

27:50.444 --> 27:53.780
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

27:56.117 --> 27:57.850
Thank you.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.344
Did you find your... key?

28:24.378 --> 28:27.380
Nope.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.215
Must have left it
somewhere else.

28:29.233 --> 28:32.319
Good luck finding it.

28:50.338 --> 28:52.339
Hmm.

28:57.428 --> 29:00.347
Okay, let's go.

29:01.432 --> 29:03.416
Come on, buddy. Come on.

29:03.434 --> 29:05.385
Come here. Come here.

29:05.419 --> 29:07.470
Find the treat.

29:07.521 --> 29:11.057
It's so delicious, right?
So delicious.

29:11.091 --> 29:12.925
Good boy! Good boy!

29:12.943 --> 29:16.896
Oh, how could anyone
be allergic to you?

29:16.930 --> 29:19.199
Okay, let's go.

29:19.233 --> 29:21.117
Come on, come on, come on.

29:25.956 --> 29:27.073
Yeah?

29:44.258 --> 29:46.393
Baby, I swear
we don't have a dog!

29:46.427 --> 29:48.061
You must have!

29:48.095 --> 29:51.130
It's the only thing
I'm allergic to!

30:04.245 --> 30:06.029
What's that?

30:06.080 --> 30:07.614
It's dog fur,

30:07.648 --> 30:08.948
and it's all over my sheets,

30:08.982 --> 30:10.750
along with crumbs
from a dog biscuit.

30:10.785 --> 30:12.535
Well, whatever kinky stuff
you and Julie are into,

30:12.586 --> 30:14.371
that's your business.

30:14.422 --> 30:18.041
Carmen, this is really
how you're gonna be right now?

30:19.427 --> 30:21.177
Okay!

30:21.212 --> 30:22.545
I did it.

30:22.596 --> 30:23.463
But I just thought she was
gonna get, like, a...

30:23.497 --> 30:25.131
like a rash or something.

30:25.165 --> 30:26.433
You could've killed her.
I know.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.385
I'm sorry.

30:28.436 --> 30:30.303
I just wanted her to go away.

30:30.337 --> 30:32.105
Are you jealous?

30:32.139 --> 30:34.307
No.

30:34.341 --> 30:35.675
Are you sure?

30:35.693 --> 30:37.394
I don't know what I was
feeling or... or thinking.

30:37.445 --> 30:39.612
I'm just... I'm sorry.

30:39.647 --> 30:42.348
I-I am very, very sorry.

30:42.366 --> 30:46.152
You had your chance.
You turned me down.

30:46.186 --> 30:47.704
So if you're not gonna
be with me,

30:47.738 --> 30:49.622
you have to let me be
with someone else.

30:49.657 --> 30:51.541
Okay?

31:06.557 --> 31:08.591
I told you to sell this.

31:08.642 --> 31:10.643
No.
I want you to have it.

31:10.678 --> 31:12.929
- Genevieve, I...
- Listen to me.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.432
I've had
six different husbands.

31:15.483 --> 31:18.318
They all vowed to stand by me
for the rest of my life,

31:18.352 --> 31:20.019
but none of them did.

31:21.322 --> 31:23.156
Only one person
has always been there,

31:23.190 --> 31:26.025
for better or for worse.

31:26.059 --> 31:28.361
So I want you to have
this ring...

31:28.395 --> 31:30.580
not as a gift,

31:30.614 --> 31:33.399
but as my promise
to take care of you,

31:33.417 --> 31:36.569
just like you have always
taken care of me.

31:43.043 --> 31:45.094
But you still have to come up
with a plan.

31:45.129 --> 31:48.131
You have a lot of bills
coming in,

31:48.182 --> 31:50.383
and you can't keep
exchanging sex for watercolors.

31:50.417 --> 31:53.219
Oh, I have a plan.

31:53.253 --> 31:55.221
Uh-oh.

31:55.255 --> 31:56.606
What are you gonna do?

31:56.640 --> 31:59.091
What I've always done.

31:59.109 --> 32:02.145
It's time to find
husband number seven.

32:27.454 --> 32:29.556
You're right.

32:29.590 --> 32:31.624
I am jealous.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.834
Marisol, what are you doing up?

32:51.868 --> 32:54.971
I needed
to talk to you both.

32:55.005 --> 32:56.005
What's all this?

32:56.039 --> 32:57.757
I made Martinis.

32:57.808 --> 33:00.376
Thanks, but we're not thirsty.

33:00.394 --> 33:03.212
After I'm finished,

33:03.230 --> 33:06.098
you're going to want a drink.

33:09.903 --> 33:13.722
So how many of these DVDs
do you think Adrian has?

33:13.740 --> 33:17.276
Well, if Mr. Powell taped
one of your sessions,

33:17.327 --> 33:19.996
he probably taped all of them.

33:20.030 --> 33:21.730
Oh, my God.

33:21.748 --> 33:24.166
Obviously,
this could be devastating

33:24.201 --> 33:26.002
if any of these got out,

33:26.036 --> 33:27.736
landed on the Internet.

33:27.754 --> 33:28.737
Adrian wouldn't do that.

33:28.755 --> 33:30.339
Would he?

33:30.374 --> 33:33.909
He might not, but you probably
don't wanna take that chance.

33:33.927 --> 33:35.744
Now...

33:35.762 --> 33:38.881
I would be willing
to steal them for you,

33:38.915 --> 33:42.051
but I would need to know where
Adrian keeps his collection.

33:42.085 --> 33:43.469
Any ideas?

33:43.520 --> 33:46.939
Not really.
It's such a huge house.

33:46.973 --> 33:50.443
Michael, did he ever
say anything to you?

33:52.312 --> 33:54.980
Mr. Stappord.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.866
Michael, where are you going?

33:58.869 --> 34:00.903
Oh, no.

34:11.297 --> 34:13.331
Michael. What a surprise.

34:13.382 --> 34:14.833
Did Evelyn let you in?

34:32.985 --> 34:34.136
The den.

34:41.745 --> 34:44.280
I bet you feel like
a big man now,

34:44.313 --> 34:45.498
which is ironic, considering...

34:45.532 --> 34:47.149
Where are they?

34:47.167 --> 34:48.951
Safe and sound.
Don't you worry.

34:48.985 --> 34:50.168
Uhh!

34:50.203 --> 34:51.420
Mr. Stappord, stop!

34:51.455 --> 34:52.838
You're gonna kill him!

34:52.873 --> 34:54.340
You listen to me, you pervert!

34:54.373 --> 34:57.126
I'm not leaving here
without those DVDs!

34:57.160 --> 34:58.594
Michael!

35:01.381 --> 35:04.183
Party's over. Get out.

35:07.020 --> 35:10.473
Perhaps my tone is not conveying
the seriousness of my intention.

35:14.010 --> 35:16.362
Have I made myself clear?

35:16.396 --> 35:17.897
Adrian has something
that belongs to me,

35:17.948 --> 35:19.565
and I'm not leaving
until I get it.

35:21.401 --> 35:23.852
Are you talking about the DVDs?

35:23.870 --> 35:25.204
You know?

35:25.238 --> 35:27.990
I know everything
that happens in this house.

35:28.024 --> 35:29.959
I'm going to give them
what they came for,

35:29.993 --> 35:32.027
and then we're gonna put this
nasty little mess behind us.

35:32.045 --> 35:33.963
Okay?

35:33.997 --> 35:35.498
Fine.

35:35.532 --> 35:38.250
I was tired
of looking at your wife anyway.

35:38.301 --> 35:40.202
So help me, Michael.

35:43.206 --> 35:45.541
Adrian?

35:45.559 --> 35:47.209
Go get some ice for your lip.

35:47.227 --> 35:50.312
Michael, you, Taylor, sit down.
Behave yourselves.

35:50.347 --> 35:52.064
I'm gonna get what you want.

35:52.098 --> 35:54.016
Marisol...

35:54.050 --> 35:56.569
come with me.

36:38.061 --> 36:39.862
Here we go.

36:47.487 --> 36:50.105
"The Taylor Collection"?

36:55.295 --> 36:57.379
As you can see,

36:57.414 --> 36:59.882
there are no other DVDs
bearing Taylor's name.

37:01.301 --> 37:04.303
Make sure you tell Michael
he has everything.

37:09.426 --> 37:12.928
Well, Michael, Taylor,

37:12.962 --> 37:16.015
obviously, we won't
be socializing anymore.

37:16.066 --> 37:17.299
What a relief it will be

37:17.317 --> 37:19.468
to stop pretending
that we like each other.

37:25.575 --> 37:26.992
Oh, and, Marisol?

37:29.279 --> 37:31.330
You're fired.

37:38.288 --> 37:41.090
Did you talk to the doctors?

37:41.124 --> 37:43.425
I did. Spence is doing
much better.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.344
He's awake and talking.

37:45.378 --> 37:47.429
Thank God.

37:49.332 --> 37:51.350
What is that?

37:51.384 --> 37:52.551
It's our wedding album.

37:52.602 --> 37:55.354
Just... got the urge
to go through it.

37:55.388 --> 37:58.190
Look.
It's Spence in his tux.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.477
So handsome.

38:01.511 --> 38:02.778
Wasn't he, though?

38:04.481 --> 38:07.733
You two seem very happy.

38:12.289 --> 38:15.624
I've decided
to go into therapy.

38:15.659 --> 38:17.543
Therapy?

38:17.577 --> 38:20.746
I want to understand why
I'm such a raging bitch.

38:22.165 --> 38:23.666
Ohh.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.635
You've seen me in action.
I'm a nightmare, right?

38:26.670 --> 38:28.170
No.

38:28.204 --> 38:29.638
I've seen worse.

38:29.673 --> 38:32.040
How? Did you clean
for Hitler?

38:32.058 --> 38:38.046
The things I say,
the way I act out...

38:38.064 --> 38:41.183
Something is wrong with me...

38:42.519 --> 38:45.521
And I'm going to fix it.

38:45.555 --> 38:49.057
What made you decide this?

38:51.444 --> 38:53.862
For the past year, I...

38:53.896 --> 38:56.448
began to think
I didn't love Spence anymore.

38:56.499 --> 39:01.587
But when
I saw him in that hospital...

39:01.621 --> 39:04.423
Oh, I do love him, Rosie.

39:04.457 --> 39:06.592
I just...

39:06.626 --> 39:08.677
forget it sometimes.

39:08.712 --> 39:11.513
Well...

39:11.548 --> 39:13.349
It's good you know that.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.635
So I'm gonna change for him,

39:16.686 --> 39:18.721
be the best wife ever.

39:18.755 --> 39:22.524
And Spence and I will
be happy again.

39:23.777 --> 39:26.145
It's a good thing,

39:26.196 --> 39:28.313
to be happy.

39:43.546 --> 39:44.613
Hello?

39:44.631 --> 39:47.299
Yeah, it's Michael.
I'm...

39:47.333 --> 39:50.085
I'm calling to see how you are.

39:50.119 --> 39:51.470
Well, apparently,

39:51.504 --> 39:53.422
I'm in need
of some plastic surgery.

39:53.456 --> 39:55.474
But to be fair,

39:55.508 --> 39:57.459
Evelyn's been saying that
for years.

39:57.477 --> 39:59.728
I had too much to drink.
You know how I get.

39:59.763 --> 40:02.264
I suppose I do.

40:02.298 --> 40:05.234
You know the real reason
why I came over there tonight,

40:05.268 --> 40:06.435
don't you, Adrian?

40:06.469 --> 40:09.571
You had an ulterior motive?
I'm shocked.

40:09.606 --> 40:12.107
I want that DVD back.

40:12.141 --> 40:13.642
The one with Flora?

40:13.660 --> 40:17.696
Relax. I smashed it
into a millions bits...

40:17.747 --> 40:19.281
a long time ago.

40:20.483 --> 40:22.150
Thank God.

40:22.168 --> 40:25.320
Obviously, back when I still
considered you a friend.

40:27.123 --> 40:29.658
Again, Adrian,
I'm sorry for what I did.

40:29.676 --> 40:32.177
Well, we all make mistakes.
