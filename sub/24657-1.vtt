01:11.042 --> 01:14.083
Seen the news? Is it real?

01:14.167 --> 01:16.333
If it's true, I'm so fucking dead.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.332
What did Tae-dong say?

01:19.333 --> 01:20.583
Let's go talk to him.

01:24.833 --> 01:25.917
Let's eat.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.292
What's going on?

01:31.083 --> 01:33.333
Tae-dong, what happened?

01:33.833 --> 01:34.833
What do you mean?

01:35.083 --> 01:37.458
You idiot, it was a scam!

- What's going on?
- Please calm down.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.500
- Tell me what's going on!
- I didn't know either!

01:53.417 --> 01:56.042
Tell me it's not real.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.000
It's all over!

01:58.833 --> 02:01.292
Where is Jang Doo-chil? Where's my money?

02:01.375 --> 02:04.792
He fled with my money too! I'm so fucked!

02:05.167 --> 02:08.375
Wait, so we can't get our money back?

02:08.500 --> 02:10.207
Let's drop it. No more.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.458
What?

02:12.792 --> 02:14.042
Honey wake up!

02:16.167 --> 02:18.832
Asshole, you vouched for him!

02:18.833 --> 02:20.250
Are you on his side?

02:20.458 --> 02:22.832
We're dead without that money!

02:22.833 --> 02:25.957
- Give our money back!
- Tae-dong!

02:25.958 --> 02:27.833
Let go of him!

02:29.875 --> 02:32.707
You okay? Are you hurt?

02:32.708 --> 02:33.833
Ma...

02:34.833 --> 02:37.250
How could you do this to him?

02:37.417 --> 02:40.792
Aunt, we're all broke!

02:40.875 --> 02:43.000
Tae-dong said it was our last chance!

02:43.542 --> 02:45.792
Tae-dong even put in

02:47.167 --> 02:49.625
the death benefit of his father!

02:49.917 --> 02:51.125
What?

02:52.875 --> 02:55.625
Bro... Uncle...

02:59.958 --> 03:01.208

03:42.083 --> 03:43.207
You're so dead!

03:43.208 --> 03:44.333
You jerk!

03:50.458 --> 03:51.875
Just stop!

- You prick!
- Shhh!

05:06.042 --> 05:08.917
That fucking rat! Look over there.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.000
I'll kill him!

05:13.042 --> 05:14.500
That was close!

05:19.625 --> 05:21.208
How the hell did they find out?

05:21.417 --> 05:25.041
It's all over, once you're caught.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.041
Then I won't get caught.

05:27.042 --> 05:29.624
They can't turn me in since
they're stolen goods anyway.

05:29.625 --> 05:32.250
Not a shred of business ethics.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.583
Ta-da!

05:38.125 --> 05:39.083
One's for you.

05:39.084 --> 05:40.583
One is real, and the other is fake.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.875
- Right one.
- Sure?

05:47.792 --> 05:49.542
You're still good.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.125
Mr. Night Fog!

05:51.875 --> 05:53.041
Nice.

05:53.042 --> 05:54.083
You're good.

05:55.167 --> 05:58.083
I'll be a good son and take the fake one.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.500
Like hell you are!

06:03.917 --> 06:05.708
It's quite nice for a fake.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.958
What are you hiding?

06:09.958 --> 06:12.208
- Jang Doo-chil?
- Give it to me!

06:12.292 --> 06:14.958
You said you're retired.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.917
This is my last job.

06:20.875 --> 06:21.957
Look at his face!

06:21.958 --> 06:24.875
He's got the slanted eyes of a crook.

06:24.917 --> 06:28.542
How did everyone trust him with
their money, with no doubts?

06:28.792 --> 06:30.542
They doubted a thousand times.

06:31.292 --> 06:33.292
That's why they get conned.

06:35.083 --> 06:38.542
Doubts become assurance
once they're dispelled.

06:41.958 --> 06:45.292
I'll be late. Don't wait up.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.708
Dad, should I tag along?

06:49.167 --> 06:50.500
No, kiddo.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.875
No need to get your life in a knot.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.417
See you soon.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.207
Transfer to a Chinese ship
in international waters,

07:14.208 --> 07:16.042
and they'll take you to Dalian city.

07:17.792 --> 07:20.125
Don't come to me even if you fail.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.375
You can't go in! Step back!

07:56.583 --> 07:58.000
You need to stay out!

07:58.833 --> 08:00.292
What's going on?

08:00.833 --> 08:01.625
Get him out!

08:01.626 --> 08:03.124
You can't be here!

08:03.125 --> 08:04.000
Get out!

08:04.042 --> 08:07.500
Let go of me. Dad, wake up!

08:09.083 --> 08:13.458
I should've tagged along! Let go of me!

- Uh... sure.

It's perfect for you.

Detective Kim, go easy!

10:48.125 --> 10:49.208
Shut it.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.375
You got me into so much shit.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.541
- Is this it?
- Yes.

10:55.542 --> 10:58.333
- I need to take a photo.
- Sure. Thank you, sir.

10:58.542 --> 11:02.250
If it weren't for you, I
could've been in big trouble.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.458
Not at all, sir.

11:03.459 --> 11:06.291
You acted so naturally.
You could be an actor.

11:06.292 --> 11:08.958
No way.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.958
I was nervous.
My legs are still trembling.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.375
Look at this!

11:17.417 --> 11:19.833
Thought you could get me again?

11:20.333 --> 11:22.250
I can never drop my guard with you.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.667
Thank you.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.541

- Good bye.
- Thank you, bye.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.000
Detective Lee!

11:52.125 --> 11:53.833
Good job, you son of a bitch!

11:55.167 --> 11:56.417
Fucker!

12:02.875 --> 12:04.708
That was thrilling.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.708
Did you see him getting a peek?

12:16.750 --> 12:19.375
Why did you say my name? Are you nuts?

12:19.583 --> 12:20.916
No worries!

12:20.917 --> 12:23.708
He would never think that
it was your real name!

12:24.000 --> 12:24.792
Right?

12:24.793 --> 12:27.792
Her name doesn't match her looks.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.166
The evidence is solid.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.750
It'll take the heat, so handle it swiftly.

12:47.292 --> 12:48.542
What are you?

12:50.208 --> 12:51.833
Do not disturb!

12:56.500 --> 12:57.667
Who the hell are you?

12:58.458 --> 13:01.583
Seoul Prosecutor's Office, Park Hee-su.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.708
I have a warrant for your arrest.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.667
What?

13:06.875 --> 13:08.999
Where the hell do you think you are?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.499
Get him out!

13:10.500 --> 13:11.625
Come out!

13:14.292 --> 13:16.000
Don't give me an order.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.833
You son of a bitch.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.042
Do you know what it is?

13:21.750 --> 13:24.875
This is evidence that
Jang Doo-chil bribed you.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.167
You took quite a lot!

13:29.042 --> 13:32.208
The ledger revealed that
Superintendent Kim Ta-kyun

13:32.333 --> 13:37.292
was paid off with $1.2 million
over 5 different occasions.

13:39.208 --> 13:42.792
Is the ledger Jang's much
rumored bribery list?

13:43.417 --> 13:44.625
Yes, it is.

13:45.250 --> 13:50.333
We'll dig deeper into it
for additional assailants.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.125
Is he alive?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.583
Jang Doo-chil, I mean,
you're in charge of this case.

14:00.792 --> 14:05.208
I believe the police confirmed
his death a few years back.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.500
Then why do we keep hearing
stories that he's alive?

14:14.667 --> 14:16.375
I wish the rumors were true,

14:16.750 --> 14:18.333
so that I could catch him myself.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.000
Sir, Park Hee-su is here.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.958
- Come sit down.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.042
We managed to calm the public this time,

14:58.083 --> 15:00.458
but we can't afford any more
rumors surrounding the list.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.249
No more scapegoats to use!

15:03.250 --> 15:05.042
It'll go away soon.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.833
Did you find the leak?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.625
Jang Doo-chil's man named
Lee Kang-seok is the one.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.708
Could he have the real list?

15:19.542 --> 15:21.958
He's a small timer.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.958
Then lock him up before
he blabbers any further.

15:30.250 --> 15:34.292
Also see if he's got the real list.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.917
How long must I cover your ass?

15:39.833 --> 15:40.833
Hey!

15:41.917 --> 15:43.750
If this shit hits the fan,

15:44.375 --> 15:46.458
you'll take the biggest fall.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.458
Be cool.

15:50.042 --> 15:54.417
When Councilor Sung assumes
power, you'll be a made man.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.292
I'll do what I'm told.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.792
<i>Restricted Area</i>

16:17.667 --> 16:18.792
Hello, sir.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.042
New necklace?

16:28.542 --> 16:30.917
It was her birthday so
we had a small event...

16:32.375 --> 16:34.917
I told you to keep your head down.

16:36.917 --> 16:37.917
Sorry, sir.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.417
Did you dig into Lee Kang-seok?

16:42.292 --> 16:44.375
Sure. I scanned him.

16:45.625 --> 16:46.833
Let's go inside.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.750
We looked into him.

16:58.958 --> 17:01.041
He's a crazy piece of shit!

17:01.042 --> 17:01.917
Meaning?

17:01.918 --> 17:04.333
- Too shady.
- How?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.833
- He's like you.
- Fuck off!

17:08.041 --> 17:09.333
Shut your face.

17:11.041 --> 17:14.583
He spent 3 years in prison
for working with Jang,

17:14.666 --> 17:19.000
and he got involved with
various scams thereafter.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.582
He recently hooked a pushover

17:21.583 --> 17:23.499
and is pulling a real estate scam.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.082
He's below you.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.249
Why're you after this petty crook?

17:27.250 --> 17:29.542
I just need him locked up to shut him up.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.749
Then you can just arrest him.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.791
I'll catch him with the police,
and you guys go to his house

17:34.792 --> 17:37.541
and look for any ledgers.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.542
Yes, sir.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.457
Fuck.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.083
Who the hell are you?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.583
Who told you to come in, you fuckers?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.417
Listen, prosecutor,

18:02.833 --> 18:04.791
I'm the victim here!

18:04.792 --> 18:06.083
Illegal foreign exchange in May.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.625
Bogus stock last month.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.125
You were in the middle
of a real estate scam.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.458
On Choi Chang-sik.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.083
Where the hell is that old fart?!

18:15.208 --> 18:17.542
How should I know? But you should.

18:17.625 --> 18:20.542
That bastard conned me!

18:22.667 --> 18:24.542
Son of a bitch!

18:27.375 --> 18:29.916
<i>I met that old fart for the first time</i>

18:29.917 --> 18:32.125
<i>at a foreclosure auction.</i>

18:35.708 --> 18:37.625
<i>I have an eye for suckers,</i>

18:38.500 --> 18:39.624
<i>and I knew it as soon as I saw him.</i>

18:39.625 --> 18:41.583
- Wait sir.
<i>- An ideal sucker!</i>

18:53.125 --> 18:55.583
<i>This is the deciding factor.</i>

18:55.875 --> 18:57.958
<i>The sooner he calls, the easier the job.</i>

19:00.042 --> 19:03.250
<i>And he called me within a day.</i>

19:03.750 --> 19:05.207
<i>A major sucker!</i>

19:05.208 --> 19:06.667
Mr. Choi!

19:07.375 --> 19:09.583
He was supposed to pay a $500K advance.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.625
Please give me 3 more days.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.207
What happened? It's so sudden.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.958
It's the money I inherited in the States,

19:19.417 --> 19:23.874
but the bank refuses to
transfer it due to some loans.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.541
Why don't you pay off the debt first?

19:25.542 --> 19:28.750
- It's more than $100K.
- I see.

19:29.292 --> 19:32.167
<i>What do we need now? Push and pull!</i>

19:32.583 --> 19:33.833
So I pushed him hard.

19:34.208 --> 19:38.167
The deal is off unless you
wire the money today.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.292
Then sell it to someone else.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.083
You can't...

19:49.542 --> 19:50.958
<i>Dammit!</i>

19:51.125 --> 19:53.250
<i>I spent a lot already to set up the agency!</i>

19:53.417 --> 19:55.250
Hey, Mr. Choi! Wait!

19:57.542 --> 19:59.250
So $100K will do?

20:03.708 --> 20:05.833
It'll take 20 minutes.

20:06.042 --> 20:08.457
You're a lucky guy

20:08.458 --> 20:10.333
to meet a guy like me!

20:11.417 --> 20:13.375
I need to go to the washroom.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.792
That's when I felt weird.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.917
<i>I have a special instinct for that.</i>

20:18.083 --> 20:20.583
I'm going too.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.875
- I'll see you outside.
- Yes...

20:33.167 --> 20:35.125
<i>That toilet didn't have a window.</i>

20:35.833 --> 20:38.083
<i>And I was right outside the washroom.</i>

20:41.000 --> 20:43.708
Mr. Choi, you're taking...

20:48.583 --> 20:50.458
What the heck?

20:54.792 --> 20:56.667
Fuck! How could he?

20:58.417 --> 20:59.917
<i>Cheating the swindler?</i>

21:00.458 --> 21:04.292
No job ethics! He should
be skinned alive!

21:08.375 --> 21:09.875
Found something?

21:10.042 --> 21:12.333
<i>We're at Lee's house.</i>

21:12.750 --> 21:15.583
<i>But it's been ransacked!</i>

21:18.625 --> 21:21.207
- Recognize him?
- Not a clue.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.958
He's not from our field.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.267
Play the security video by the washroom.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.583
Stop. Rewind.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.417
Rewind. Stop there.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.917
- When did he go in?
- Well...

21:47.333 --> 21:48.583
He didn't go in.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.083
Fuck!

22:02.875 --> 22:03.792
That bastard!

22:03.793 --> 22:05.000
Who the hell is that prick?

22:05.375 --> 22:09.833
That's the asshole who only cons swindlers!

22:10.833 --> 22:13.542
You caught me because he set me up!

22:19.458 --> 22:22.125
Sir, he ransacked Lee's house.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.917
He left the bank and came to Lee's house.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.000
Look at this guy...

22:32.917 --> 22:34.292
I got you, bastard!

22:34.542 --> 22:37.124
Let me take care of him!

22:37.125 --> 22:38.583
Where did he go afterwards?

22:39.667 --> 22:41.042
I got him.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.083
Dongho condo, #1606.

23:02.917 --> 23:03.917
What?

23:09.458 --> 23:11.125
Fuck, he's gone.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.667
<i>Sir, the parking lot!</i>

23:14.125 --> 23:15.333
<i>He's leaving!</i>

23:21.875 --> 23:23.375
- Direct me.
- Wait a minute.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.417
You look this way.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.417
Let me see.

23:31.083 --> 23:34.125
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

23:34.583 --> 23:36.500
Look at this! That's the one.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.333
Wait!

23:40.375 --> 23:41.666
Right.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.916
He's waiting for a left turn
at Myung-ji intersection.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.333
It's a black Sonata.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.458
<i>Next block.</i>

24:06.917 --> 24:08.375
He's turning left now.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.208
We turned left too.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.208
He's waiting for the left turn
at Joong-ang junction.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.167
Gotcha!

24:39.958 --> 24:40.958
Come out!

24:42.875 --> 24:44.125
Come out, fucker!

24:46.792 --> 24:49.625
Why's the window so tinted?

25:12.125 --> 25:13.167
It wasn't me...

25:16.625 --> 25:17.625
Turn right!

25:22.167 --> 25:23.917
Turn left in front of
the convenience store.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.667
I got no visuals in that area.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.083
Found me faster than I thought.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.167
You know me?

27:03.208 --> 27:04.917
I saw you taking Lee Kang-seok.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.958
You don't look like police.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.333
I guess you're a prosecutor?

27:11.958 --> 27:13.375
You were watching me?

27:15.833 --> 27:17.625
Quite interesting.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.542
Long time no see.

27:34.958 --> 27:36.792
How have you been, you son of a bitch?

27:40.250 --> 27:41.333
Hey, hey!

27:42.958 --> 27:47.833
I rotted in jail for a year
because of you, bastard!

27:55.667 --> 27:57.625
What did you take from Lee's house?

28:03.292 --> 28:05.125
Looking for something?

28:06.167 --> 28:10.583
Why didn't you take off after the job?

28:13.917 --> 28:16.125
What was the real reason you conned Lee?

28:19.417 --> 28:21.458
He's just bait.

28:22.417 --> 28:24.500
- To reel another.
- Who?

28:26.500 --> 28:28.250
You don't wanna know...

28:29.500 --> 28:30.500
Do I?

28:31.458 --> 28:34.875
- Jang Doo-chil.
- Jang Doo-chil?

28:35.333 --> 28:36.875
Fuck!

28:37.333 --> 28:39.542
- He died a long time ago.
- Yes, he died...

28:39.875 --> 28:41.333
...officially.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.500
You also believe that rumor?

28:47.792 --> 28:49.458
It's not a rumor.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.875
I met him.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.833
<i>He's known to have died in China,</i>

28:58.500 --> 29:01.708
<i>but he left China after
faking his own death.</i>

29:03.833 --> 29:06.208
<i>I wandered many countries to find him</i>

29:07.583 --> 29:09.708
<i>and finally found his right-hand man</i>

29:11.583 --> 29:14.000
<i>4 years ago in Thailand.</i>

29:38.292 --> 29:41.750
<i>I thought I finally had him,</i>

29:44.125 --> 29:45.833
<i>but I moved too hastily.</i>

29:48.708 --> 29:51.042
<i>He was standing in front of me</i>

29:52.208 --> 29:54.000
<i>but there was nothing I could do.</i>

29:56.833 --> 29:58.500
<i>That was it.</i>

29:59.208 --> 30:01.000
<i>I managed to escape</i>

30:01.708 --> 30:03.750
<i>but that was the last time I saw him.</i>

30:05.458 --> 30:06.500
So?

30:07.375 --> 30:10.500
You were gonna bait Jang with Lee?

30:11.083 --> 30:12.583
Christ.

30:12.917 --> 30:15.042
You think you're a superhero?

30:15.667 --> 30:17.208
I'm not trying to catch him.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.792
I just need to meet him once.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.542
Just once.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.000
So that I can kill him.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Hwang Ji-sung, 33.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.083
No criminal record. He's clean.

30:36.542 --> 30:37.916
Immigration records show

30:37.917 --> 30:39.917
he was in Thailand 4 years ago.

30:40.667 --> 30:41.708
Any family?

30:42.167 --> 30:44.249
His father committed suicide in 2008.

30:44.250 --> 30:46.042
He's got no relatives.

30:48.083 --> 30:50.917
<i>Seeing our young people
giving up their own lives,</i>

30:51.125 --> 30:55.042
the children who are fed
up with competitions,

30:55.708 --> 30:59.125
and the ordinary people,
who can't escape poverty,

31:02.417 --> 31:04.625
my tears flowed, and I was convinced.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.833
Citizens of Korea,

31:19.333 --> 31:20.625
I, Sung Yong-jae,

31:20.958 --> 31:23.707
declare my bid for the presidency

31:23.708 --> 31:26.125
to make Korea a better nation for all!

31:27.583 --> 31:30.708
Sung Yong-jae! Sung Yong-jae!

31:30.917 --> 31:32.333
The reaction was incredible.

31:32.583 --> 31:36.208
Tugging at the heartstrings
was the deciding factor.

31:37.708 --> 31:41.042
Don't worry about the media!

31:41.292 --> 31:43.958
I'll make the big stir!

31:45.042 --> 31:46.333
Let's drink.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.250
Prosecutor Park.

31:51.417 --> 31:52.917
Something's bothering you?

31:57.167 --> 31:58.958
Jang Doo-chil is alive.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.583
Why are you bringing it up here?

32:05.792 --> 32:07.166
We've got a witness.

32:07.167 --> 32:08.957
Then take care of it as usual.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.833
It won't stop here.

32:11.292 --> 32:13.125
More witnesses will come forward.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.625
Dammit...

32:15.250 --> 32:18.708
We shouldn't have let
him leave Korea alive.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.250
Let's get rid of him.

32:25.208 --> 32:27.542
Don't make this into a big deal.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.417
I'm not.

32:29.917 --> 32:31.677
I want to root out the
source of our trouble.

32:36.792 --> 32:37.917
Be honest.

32:38.333 --> 32:42.375
You just don't want to be
known as Jang's prosecutor.

32:44.583 --> 32:48.708
He just wants to erase his past!

32:51.083 --> 32:52.917
It's not just my past.

32:53.458 --> 32:54.749
- What?
- How dare you?

32:54.750 --> 32:56.417
That's enough.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.000
Prosecutor Park, we're on the same team.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.792
Just take care of the witnesses, okay?

33:18.958 --> 33:20.833
Damn fuckers.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.333
Too stupid for politics!

33:23.792 --> 33:26.000
Idiots...

33:44.542 --> 33:46.333
If you're gonna kill me, do it now.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.000
What's your plan to reel in Jang?

34:07.625 --> 34:09.417
None of your business.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.917
Why're you so obsessed?

34:16.542 --> 34:18.458
Nothing changes by killing him.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.708
Nothing changes?

34:24.500 --> 34:29.042
Would you utter the same shit
if your father died too?

34:39.917 --> 34:41.083
Let's get him.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.125
Let's get Jang Doo-chil.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.167
You and I?

34:49.583 --> 34:51.208
We're after the same thing.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.333
Jang Doo-chil's death.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.125
But I have one condition.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.333
I'll kill him myself.

35:11.708 --> 35:14.291
It's Jang Doo-chil we're talking about!

35:14.292 --> 35:16.750
If this goes bad, you're totally fucked!

35:17.000 --> 35:18.749
Then how could we live?

35:18.750 --> 35:19.750
So?

35:20.583 --> 35:23.625
But more than anything,
I can't work with that fuck!

35:24.542 --> 35:25.625
I won't!

35:29.875 --> 35:31.542
Don't do it, if you're not up to it.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.792
If you want to run, just run.

35:36.750 --> 35:39.250
- I haven't made up my mind...
- But...

35:39.792 --> 35:43.167
If you're not sure, don't bark.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.792
Are we all good?

35:55.917 --> 35:58.333
Let's clear one thing first.

35:59.042 --> 36:03.083
I'll set up the plan, and
we'll do it my way. Okay?

36:04.583 --> 36:06.417
- No problem.
- What?

36:09.042 --> 36:10.042
Okay.

36:15.792 --> 36:16.792
Okay?

36:19.958 --> 36:21.000
Okay!

36:22.750 --> 36:24.332
Let's get Lee first.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.875
Say what? He's locked up.

36:27.958 --> 36:28.875
I'll get him out tomorrow.

36:28.876 --> 36:32.333
No, it's a new setup,
this is a team game now.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.583
How about a beating?

36:40.500 --> 36:43.625
How could you beat me? I'm your senior!

36:43.667 --> 36:45.750
You hit me first!

36:45.917 --> 36:47.749
Also I warned you about
pocketing the collection!

36:47.750 --> 36:48.916
No respect for the thief!

36:48.917 --> 36:52.707
It's not pocketing! I doubled your money!

36:52.708 --> 36:55.167
By blowing off $1 million?

36:55.583 --> 36:58.291
I wanted to pay back
your money all at once!

36:58.292 --> 37:00.082
Lee will perk up when we talk money.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.250
Ignore him at first.

37:07.917 --> 37:10.000
- Excuse me...
- Ji-sung!

37:10.583 --> 37:11.833
Let's be honest,

37:12.250 --> 37:13.916
I did it for both of us.

37:13.917 --> 37:16.541
I'm fed up with your excuses.

37:16.542 --> 37:17.750
Don't ever talk to me!

37:18.375 --> 37:21.292
You want me to beg you?!

37:21.500 --> 37:22.500
Desperately?

37:22.501 --> 37:25.458
Over my fucking dead body!

37:27.833 --> 37:29.291
I'm on my knees.

37:29.292 --> 37:31.500
You can't see, but I really am.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.167
Ji-sung!

37:34.500 --> 37:37.458
You're rich, so this means nothing,

37:37.750 --> 37:41.792
but I'm nothing without you!

37:43.958 --> 37:45.417
I swear!

37:45.833 --> 37:48.458
I'm your faithful dog now!

37:49.042 --> 37:51.958
I'll follow your orders.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.750
Stop it!

37:56.542 --> 37:58.333
Fine, enough!

37:58.708 --> 38:00.167
This is your last chance.

38:00.417 --> 38:01.292
And bait?

38:01.375 --> 38:04.292
Throw him his favorite.

38:05.458 --> 38:06.458
Real estate.

38:09.042 --> 38:10.083
Listen, Ji-sung.

38:10.542 --> 38:12.499
To redeem myself,

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
I'll bring you something big.

38:15.458 --> 38:16.917
It's real estate. Interested?

38:17.417 --> 38:18.624
The best business in Korea.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.332
I'll take care of myself.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.000
You just don't mess around.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.792
I got it, I'll behave.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.667
The investigation is over.
Let Lee Kang-seok out.

38:39.292 --> 38:40.708
Hello there!

38:41.542 --> 38:44.125
You're a fine gentleman.

38:45.833 --> 38:48.500
You look familiar. Have we met before?

38:49.208 --> 38:50.292
Bye for now.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.042
Yes, he's on your tail.

39:10.167 --> 39:12.875
He'll do a background check on
me, is everything in order?

39:13.292 --> 39:14.333
Of course.

39:14.583 --> 39:17.292
He'll try to eat you alive.

39:18.042 --> 39:19.167
Just be careful.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.166
- Afternoon.
- Hello, hello!

39:30.167 --> 39:32.957
- Win much today?
- You know what it's like.

39:32.958 --> 39:34.375
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.208
Gosh!

39:42.500 --> 39:43.708
Oh, hello again!

39:45.375 --> 39:46.500
Do I know you?

39:47.250 --> 39:48.500
You don't recognize me?

39:49.958 --> 39:53.167
- At the lockup...
- Ah, right.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.875
Thank you for calling JM Assets.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.082
Sure, should I put you through?

40:28.083 --> 40:31.041
I know it's your first time,
but don't get nervous.

40:31.042 --> 40:33.082
Could you give her a call

40:33.083 --> 40:34.666
and pretend to talk to each other?

40:34.667 --> 40:36.416
- And also...
- He's here, get ready!

40:36.417 --> 40:38.457
Relax and try to be natural!

40:38.458 --> 40:41.208
Look like employees here! And don't
forget to greet that bastard...

40:41.583 --> 40:44.167
...I mean, the CEO.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.500
This can't be just a coincidence.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.833
Really? Sure, the brotherhood

40:53.167 --> 40:55.708
between cellmates is stronger
than that of soldiers.

40:56.250 --> 40:58.457
Bars rather than guns.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.333
It was my first time there.

41:03.958 --> 41:06.875
I heard that from somebody.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.750
<i>It was my first time, too.</i>

41:11.333 --> 41:13.083
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

41:13.417 --> 41:16.332
I overheard you were
looking into real estate.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.667
No, I'm through with it.

41:18.875 --> 41:21.375
I was scammed recently...

41:23.375 --> 41:25.167
Oh, gosh...

41:32.042 --> 41:38.125
My father who lived in the
States just passed away.

41:38.208 --> 41:41.125
He left me some inheritance...

41:42.375 --> 41:44.208
Isn't that how he got scammed?

41:44.542 --> 41:46.458
But I don't have anywhere
to invest that money.

41:47.208 --> 41:48.500
Is that so?

41:49.583 --> 41:51.875
I shouldn't say this on
our first meeting...

41:54.625 --> 41:56.375
No, forget it.

41:56.917 --> 41:59.917
Come on, we're already like brothers.

42:00.292 --> 42:03.083
Well, because it's illegal.

42:03.458 --> 42:05.125
I love it.

42:06.375 --> 42:07.833
Illegal stuff!

42:09.333 --> 42:11.500
Wow, you're a real man!

42:14.083 --> 42:18.000
The truth is, I've been
looking for a partner.

42:18.208 --> 42:20.333
- Partner?
- Concerning my casino.

42:20.708 --> 42:24.292
The return is good, but it
requires a large capital.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.917
- How much?
- $1 million.

42:27.667 --> 42:30.125
The return on investment
is 80% within 6 months.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.333
A million?

42:38.083 --> 42:42.125
$1 million, you say...

42:44.667 --> 42:47.666
Perhaps I was being too hasty.

42:47.667 --> 42:48.917
Just forget what I said.

42:49.958 --> 42:52.042
No, Mr. Hwang!

42:53.125 --> 42:57.167
I guess you're really lucky,
meeting a man like me.

42:57.625 --> 42:59.332
<i>Please give me more details.</i>

42:59.333 --> 43:01.333
The sooner he calls,
the easier the job, eh?

43:01.500 --> 43:03.082
It didn't even take 5 minutes!

43:03.083 --> 43:04.750
A major sucker!

43:05.208 --> 43:07.583
Hello, Mr. Lim.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.292
The reason I'm calling is...

43:09.708 --> 43:11.042
The time has come!

43:11.125 --> 43:13.250
It's the big score.

43:13.542 --> 43:15.999
<i>Trust me and lend me $1 million...</i>

43:16.000 --> 43:17.666
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

43:17.667 --> 43:19.250
He's a nervous wreck!

43:19.500 --> 43:22.208
He can't even bait one person!

43:22.667 --> 43:25.250
Would you? Think for once!

43:26.083 --> 43:27.375
Why do you hate me?

43:27.708 --> 43:30.083
There's only one person
who has that money.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.208
Jang Doo-chil.

43:35.792 --> 43:38.375
He's a persistent prick.

43:43.333 --> 43:44.708
He's making a phone call!

43:47.000 --> 43:48.333
Who are you calling?

43:51.708 --> 43:53.000
It's an international call.

43:59.708 --> 44:02.333
<i>Boss, it's Kang-seok.</i>

44:02.458 --> 44:04.917
<i>I told you not to call!</i>

44:05.875 --> 44:07.332
<i>- Sorry sir.</i>
- Jang?

44:07.333 --> 44:08.792
- Shush!
<i>- It's urgent.</i>

44:10.083 --> 44:14.083
<i>Could you please lend me $1 million?</i>

44:14.458 --> 44:16.917
<i>I said I'd pay you back later.</i>

44:17.792 --> 44:20.375
Jang's right-hand man,
from Lee's hometown.

44:20.875 --> 44:23.208
<i>We can make $800K in 6 months!</i>

44:23.917 --> 44:24.917
<i>What is it?</i>

44:25.000 --> 44:26.750
This guy's a money launderer.

44:26.958 --> 44:28.500
I want to run a casino with him.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.874
<i>- Money launderer?</i>
- Yes, he seems like...

44:30.875 --> 44:32.707
No, he's a big shot! Real big!

44:32.708 --> 44:33.792
<i>Wait.</i>

44:35.292 --> 44:36.583
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

44:36.958 --> 44:38.208
<i>It's Kang-seok.</i>

44:40.792 --> 44:41.917
<i>It's me.</i>

44:42.167 --> 44:43.750
<i>- How have you been?</i>
- That's him!

44:46.833 --> 44:49.083
<i>Sir, how are you?</i>

44:49.500 --> 44:50.958
<i>It's been a while.</i>

44:51.167 --> 44:54.416
<i>So, he's a money launderer?</i>

44:54.417 --> 44:56.625
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Listen, Kang-seok.</i>

44:57.333 --> 44:59.250
<i>You know I don't trust people easily...</i>

44:59.708 --> 45:02.583
<i>But sir...</i>

45:02.792 --> 45:04.333
<i>I'll send someone over.</i>

45:04.625 --> 45:06.542
<i>Let him take care of it.</i>

45:07.292 --> 45:09.624
<i>You'll get your cut.</i>

45:09.625 --> 45:11.000
<i>I see. Thank you, sir.</i>

45:17.000 --> 45:18.333
<i>Good work.</i>

45:18.917 --> 45:21.916
He's not dead!

45:21.917 --> 45:24.832
It's really Jang! This is nuts!

45:24.833 --> 45:26.393
He cheated his own death? Unbelievable.

45:27.250 --> 45:29.957
- Location?
- Somewhere in Thailand.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.166
He used relays to mask his coordinates,

45:32.167 --> 45:33.541
so his exact location isn't clear.

45:33.542 --> 45:36.125
- You met him in Thailand?
- Yes.

45:36.583 --> 45:38.333
Who's he sending over?

45:39.667 --> 45:42.458
Whoever it is, we need to lure him in.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.708
Kwak Seung-gun.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.707
He's a hotshot businessman
with no criminal records.

45:54.708 --> 45:56.625
No evident connection to Jang Doo-chil.

45:56.792 --> 45:59.667
He'd never send someone who
can be traced back to him.

46:00.917 --> 46:03.958
He must be rooted out.

46:06.417 --> 46:09.542
This is my godfather's casino.

46:10.208 --> 46:12.666
At first it was for Koreans,

46:12.667 --> 46:15.750
but as you see, over 90%
of the clientele is Chinese.

46:17.792 --> 46:20.875
They go apeshit for gambling.

46:21.167 --> 46:24.375
They come with big bucks,
so the casino's booming,

46:24.792 --> 46:26.512
but there aren't enough
people to manage it.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.292
- Jackpot!
- It's a jackpot!

46:35.042 --> 46:36.333
Congratulations!

46:44.333 --> 46:46.708
This is my specialty.

46:47.125 --> 46:49.708
I do money laundering for my godfather,

46:50.042 --> 46:51.667
and I get a cut.

46:52.500 --> 46:55.042
We raked in foreign money and doubled it,

46:55.333 --> 46:57.000
no, tripled it in 6 months!

47:00.625 --> 47:02.582
This is what we call

47:02.583 --> 47:03.958
a jackpot!

47:07.750 --> 47:09.292
The terms are very good.

47:10.042 --> 47:13.208
We were lucky to meet Hwang!

47:13.875 --> 47:16.500
It's perfect for a con.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.250
Is there a problem?

47:24.375 --> 47:26.917
Who'd give these terms to
someone you just met?

47:27.042 --> 47:29.083
It's a jackpot if you run it yourself.

47:29.500 --> 47:32.125
I can't manage it by myself.

47:32.417 --> 47:33.832
I only do the money laundering.

47:33.833 --> 47:35.458
That's what makes it so strange.

47:36.208 --> 47:39.667
If something goes wrong, we'll
be held legally responsible.

47:40.125 --> 47:41.875
We're fucked.

47:44.417 --> 47:46.708
Say that we'll take legal heat too.

47:47.750 --> 47:48.958
Tell me.

47:50.667 --> 47:53.167
Why did you approach us?

47:58.792 --> 48:03.083
So you want money without
any responsibility?

48:03.625 --> 48:05.542
Fucking hell...

48:06.917 --> 48:08.292
What the hell are you doing?

48:09.750 --> 48:11.583
There's no limit to your greed.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.042
Let's forget the whole thing.

48:16.167 --> 48:17.500
Mr. Hwang.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.458
Mr. Hwang, wait!

48:20.458 --> 48:21.542
Dammit...

48:29.292 --> 48:30.292
Buddy!

48:30.708 --> 48:32.417
You can't just walk away like that!

48:33.000 --> 48:34.207
We gotta catch Jang!

48:34.208 --> 48:35.957
- Isn't it strange?
- What is?

48:35.958 --> 48:38.958
He saw the terms before coming here.

48:39.167 --> 48:41.082
He was never interested in the deal.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.083
Right.

48:42.084 --> 48:45.125
Had I offered better terms,
he'd be even more suspicious.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.083
Then why'd he come?

48:49.375 --> 48:51.500
There's only one reason.

48:52.792 --> 48:53.958
What is it?

48:54.625 --> 48:56.208
To test us.

48:56.917 --> 48:58.667
There must be another reason.

49:00.042 --> 49:02.749
They live really complicated lives.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.166
So suspicious!

49:04.167 --> 49:05.208
It's okay.

49:05.458 --> 49:07.625
Doubts become assurance

49:08.000 --> 49:09.667
once they're dispelled.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.332
Kwak applied for several incorporations.

49:15.333 --> 49:16.917
Could he be starting a new business?

49:17.083 --> 49:20.082
It's Jang. He did the
same thing 9 years ago.

49:20.083 --> 49:21.208
It's a good chance.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.917
He'll call Jang with even
the slightest problems.

49:25.167 --> 49:29.125
Good, so we'll create a
problem for him to report!

49:31.042 --> 49:32.125
So!

49:33.958 --> 49:35.167
What's your plan?

49:39.792 --> 49:41.208
Let's try individual play.

49:42.292 --> 49:44.125
The main operator will be Choon-ja.

49:46.625 --> 49:48.041
- Great!
- Don't bluff!

49:48.042 --> 49:49.874
I don't believe you.

49:49.875 --> 49:53.250
- No, my boyfriend told me.
- Really?

49:57.750 --> 50:00.042
- Good evening.
- Eh?

50:00.417 --> 50:03.167
- My apology for yesterday.
- Who's he?

50:04.250 --> 50:07.750
He is... a scary guy.

50:14.417 --> 50:17.583
- I want it back.
- What do you mean?

50:17.833 --> 50:19.083
My wallet.

50:24.708 --> 50:26.375
What are you doing?

50:33.792 --> 50:36.500
I don't want to touch you.
Just give it to me.

50:39.208 --> 50:41.292
If you're so confident,
search me yourself.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.707
Can somebody call the police?

50:43.708 --> 50:45.041
It's nothing at all, excuse us.

50:45.042 --> 50:48.917
Is this your wallet, sir?

50:55.542 --> 50:58.458
I'm sorry. I really am.

51:05.417 --> 51:07.832
My sincere apologies!

51:07.833 --> 51:10.708
How can I make it up to you?

51:14.500 --> 51:15.625
Please wait.

51:29.042 --> 51:30.042
Thank you.

51:32.125 --> 51:34.167
I'm sorry about yesterday.

51:34.458 --> 51:36.625
It's okay, I'm over it.

51:37.292 --> 51:39.625
Anyway do I look like a thief?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.750
No, it's just...

51:44.833 --> 51:47.750
May I buy you a drink?

51:48.208 --> 51:52.500
To get Jang's location,
we need to spy on Kwak 24/7

51:52.792 --> 51:55.667
Keep him occupied
while we search his place.

51:56.250 --> 51:57.375
Got it.

52:11.917 --> 52:12.917
How much time you need?

52:12.918 --> 52:14.875
Not long, I'll be quick.

52:15.375 --> 52:18.167
You can never drink, got that?

52:18.375 --> 52:20.625
- I'm just worried.
- Fuck off!

52:46.917 --> 52:48.167
I'm counting on you.

52:50.458 --> 52:52.874
Please, that's my limit.

52:52.875 --> 52:54.916
What? Just a bit more...

52:54.917 --> 52:55.750
No...

52:55.875 --> 52:59.542
I might make stupid mistakes
if I drink one more glass.

53:02.375 --> 53:03.375
Check, please.

53:05.250 --> 53:06.833
It could take a few hours.

53:07.333 --> 53:08.416
It's tough, right?

53:08.417 --> 53:12.042
You kidding? I can lure him for life.

53:28.042 --> 53:29.875
You're too much.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.457
What?

53:33.458 --> 53:35.083
Today is...

53:36.208 --> 53:37.667
Today is...!

53:59.583 --> 54:00.833
Yes, baby?

54:01.125 --> 54:04.207
<i>Wanna die? What's taking so long?</i>

54:04.208 --> 54:06.833
10 minutes, just hold on.

54:07.083 --> 54:11.875
Gotta be quick, because I drank!

54:12.083 --> 54:14.167
What? Dammit!

54:16.917 --> 54:20.750
I must not laugh...
You bitch! No laughing!

54:32.208 --> 54:33.292
Sorry...

54:35.042 --> 54:37.500
You'd better stop drinking.

54:37.792 --> 54:39.417
I can't...

54:42.583 --> 54:44.750
keep it together today...

54:45.458 --> 54:47.958
without drinking.

54:49.167 --> 54:52.792
Do you mind if I ask
what today means to you?

55:04.125 --> 55:06.167
You really should stop...

55:12.667 --> 55:15.708
You're a real cutie!

55:17.875 --> 55:20.000
You really are quite drunk.

55:24.542 --> 55:26.750
Are you alright? Wake up!

55:26.792 --> 55:29.250
Suzy? You okay?

55:30.542 --> 55:32.792
I'll go to Thailand while she's on him.

55:32.958 --> 55:33.958
Thailand?

55:34.583 --> 55:36.082
That's where Jang's based.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.916
If he's starting a business,
his men will be on the move.

55:38.917 --> 55:41.958
Hey, are you trying to flee?

55:43.208 --> 55:44.332
Should I go with him?

55:44.333 --> 55:46.333
You got a job to do here.

55:48.458 --> 55:49.458
What job?

55:50.875 --> 55:53.333
Could you put out an article?

56:01.375 --> 56:02.375
Sir!

56:02.833 --> 56:04.708
I just want to make something clear.

56:05.125 --> 56:06.500
Don't trust that prick.

56:06.958 --> 56:09.333
He's always hiding a step.

56:11.333 --> 56:12.875
I never trust a swindler.

56:13.625 --> 56:15.167
You know better.

56:25.958 --> 56:27.875
Why're you so busy?

56:28.500 --> 56:30.291
I didn't know we had an interview.

56:30.292 --> 56:32.666
We don't need to have
an interview to chat.

56:32.667 --> 56:34.333
I dropped by to say hello.

56:34.917 --> 56:36.667
Were we that close?

56:37.125 --> 56:39.208
Why did you release Lee Kang-seok?

56:39.542 --> 56:41.082
The innocent must be set free.

56:41.083 --> 56:42.541
You just let him go?

56:42.542 --> 56:44.708
He could be a pawn.

56:47.125 --> 56:49.082
- Whose?
- How should I know?

56:49.083 --> 56:50.250
I don't know either.

56:54.708 --> 56:55.708
Reporter Choi.

56:56.417 --> 56:59.250
Write an article, not a novel.

57:03.292 --> 57:04.250
Good morning, sir.

57:04.251 --> 57:05.832
Find out what he's up to.

57:05.833 --> 57:06.875
Yes, sir.

57:23.458 --> 57:24.667
Dammit...

57:53.792 --> 57:55.167
Here she comes.

57:59.667 --> 58:01.833
Good job, baby.

58:08.292 --> 58:09.417
It's Ji-sung.

58:12.542 --> 58:15.833
- Have you arrived?
<i>- Yes, I'm in Bangkok.</i>

58:16.542 --> 58:19.667
<i>I'll look for local brokers
who dealt with Jang.</i>

58:20.125 --> 58:22.750
- Report every hour.
<i>- Will do.</i>

58:23.375 --> 58:26.458
Let me know how Kwak reacted to the news.

58:27.917 --> 58:30.208
The call came from Thailand.

58:44.125 --> 58:45.625
Ta-da!

58:45.667 --> 58:46.708
One more time?

59:05.042 --> 59:06.708
Do I not look like a woman to you?

59:09.833 --> 59:11.083
You... do.

59:11.417 --> 59:14.000
- Am I not attractive?
- More than enough.

59:14.667 --> 59:16.583
Then what is it?

59:16.917 --> 59:19.208
Be a man and put your arm around me,

59:19.917 --> 59:21.667
and turn on the TV...

59:23.125 --> 59:24.332
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

59:24.333 --> 59:25.916
<i>This is the 8 o'clock news.</i>

59:25.917 --> 59:27.317
And talk about current affairs too.

59:27.583 --> 59:31.667
<i>Do you remember 2008's Jang Doo-chil case?</i>

59:31.958 --> 59:35.499
<i>Jang was said to have
died in 2011 in China.</i>

59:35.500 --> 59:39.917
<i>But according to recent
reports, he may still be alive.</i>

59:40.042 --> 59:41.875
<i>Han Seung-hwan reports.</i>

59:41.958 --> 59:42.958
- What is it?
- Shush!

59:42.959 --> 59:46.208
<i>I was at a diner in
Bangkok about a week ago.</i>

59:46.542 --> 59:49.708
<i>He spoke Korean and looked familiar.</i>

59:50.125 --> 59:53.417
<i>He talked about Interpol or something.</i>

59:54.375 --> 59:56.166
<i>Then someone called him "Chairman Jang,"</i>

59:56.167 --> 59:58.958
<i>and it hit me, 'that's Jang Doo-chil!'</i>

59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.750
Who's Jang Doo-chil?
I think I've heard of that name.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:03.375
Excuse me for a minute.

01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:04.958
For what?

01:00:04.959 --> 01:00:06.916
<i>Jang died of a heart
attack in December 2011,</i>

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:11.083
<i>and his ashes were transported to Korea.</i>

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.333
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Sir.

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.333
Did you watch the news?

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:28.042
We got him!

01:00:28.043 --> 01:00:30.667
<i>I'm outside. What is it?</i>

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:33.625
<i>It was about someone spotting you.</i>

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.916
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:00:36.917 --> 01:00:38.667
<i>That couldn't have been possible lately.</i>

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:41.041
<i>Your face was on the news,</i>

01:00:41.042 --> 01:00:43.167
so please take some precautions.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.833
<i>No worries. Who could still recognize me?</i>

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:51.583
<i>Anyway, could you come out? I'm nearby.</i>

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.624
<i>I'll see you at the rendezvous point.</i>

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:55.833
What? He's in Korea?

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:02.542
I'm very sorry.

01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:09.333
Follow that car, please.

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:12.792
Sir, I'm in the taxi now.

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.417
<i>Which way?</i>

01:01:17.917 --> 01:01:19.125
One second.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:27.000
<i>Towards Namsan Tunnel 1 through Ulji-ro.</i>

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:31.125
Where the hell is he going?

01:01:35.083 --> 01:01:38.167
<i>He's heading up the hill on a side road.</i>

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:50.500
He got off.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.042
<i>Where?</i>

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.167
Seoul Tower.

01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:16.708
Sir.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:24.250
<i>- It's really Jang Doo-chil, sir!</i>
- Can we bug him?

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:29.833
It's on now.

01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:33.542
Wow, what a view!

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.833
Isn't it beautiful?

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:39.250
There's no place like my home country.

01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:41.750
<i>What brought you to Seoul?</i>

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.333
<i>I had some business at the Hill.</i>

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.875
<i>But you should stay low for a while...</i>

01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:48.333
Cut it out.

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.917
The media is all bark and no bite.

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:07.500
Did you meet the guy Lee introduced?

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:10.667
He's not greedy, so he's trustworthy.

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:13.833
Don't trust him too much though.

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:16.500
Loyalty follows the money.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:18.083
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:26.375
Come to Incheon on Sunday.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.000
I've got something for you.

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:30.333
Yes, I'll see you on Sunday.

01:03:35.417 --> 01:03:37.750
Please hurry! They're leaving!

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.000
Dammit!

01:03:58.625 --> 01:03:59.708
This way!

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.250
This way!

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:15.750
Sir!

01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:18.333
He's taking the cable car!

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:30.083
- Excuse me, sir!
- Hey!

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:15.875
Goddammit!

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:27.875
Where's Kwak?

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:30.000
He just got back to the hotel.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:31.916
Let's grab him now!

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:34.625
I'll make him tell us where Jang is!

01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:36.166
Did we find out anything?

01:05:36.167 --> 01:05:38.333
Well, I'm sure they'll meet again.

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:42.457
<i>Come to Incheon on Sunday.</i>

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.667
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.916
<i>Yes, I'll see you on Sunday.</i>

01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:48.375
Incheon? I don't believe it!

01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:53.082
What is it?

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.875
<i>Reporter Choi is meeting
with that swindler Hwang.</i>

01:05:58.417 --> 01:05:59.875
What are you talking about?

01:06:10.542 --> 01:06:12.083
Talking about Jang's bribery list.

01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:13.833
What? He's not in Thailand?

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:16.791
But he called from there?

01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:18.958
Yes, the origin was confirmed as Thailand.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.457
He could've faked it, then.

01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:23.958
This was all premeditated!

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:26.792
We shouldn't have trusted him!

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:28.292
Dig in.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.625
For what?

01:06:29.626 --> 01:06:32.083
Find out what he's really been up to!

01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:34.458
Okay.

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:39.000
While you were covering this story,

01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:41.041
you haven't seen the real list?

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.583
It would've been an
exclusive if I had seen it.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.042
I have some suspects but no proof.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:52.832
You're saying that only Jang
can confirm who got bribed?

01:06:52.833 --> 01:06:56.583
There's one other person
who knows about the list.

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:57.750
Who?

01:06:57.917 --> 01:07:01.292
Prosecutor Park Hee-su,
who's in charge of this case,

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.458
I've been poking around him.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.875
Do you know him?

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:12.041
<i>From his e-mails, he's been digging around</i>

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:14.083
<i>about the bribery list.</i>

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.375
<i>That's why he met reporter Choi.</i>

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.292
What else?

01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:22.042
<i>His father who killed himself,</i>

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.083
<i>he wasn't a victim of a
scam, but a swindler.</i>

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.082
A swindler?

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:29.000
<i>Yes, his name was Hwang Yoo-seok,</i>

01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:31.417
<i>known as 'Night Fog' in our line of work.</i>

01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:36.000
It's no big deal.

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:40.499
Do it one last time.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.500
Sir, I really am done with this.

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.125
Hey, Night Fog.

01:07:45.292 --> 01:07:47.583
Don't you want to enjoy your
retirement with your family?

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:52.167
Just help smuggle him
out of Magumpo Port.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:13.958
Wrap things up nicely for me.

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:25.417
Sir, I'll take this to my grave.

01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:34.832
Trust me, I'm Night Fog,
I'm a man of my word!

01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:36.750
I will never... ever...

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.167
<i>Hello, yes?</i>

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.125
Get back to Seoul now. Jang turned up.

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:05.500
<i>Where? In Korea?</i>

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.375
<i>Where is he now?</i>

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:10.832
Don't know yet. Kwak will meet him again.

01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.625
<i>I'll take the first flight tomorrow.</i>

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.542
Find anything over there?

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:42.042
They took off a while ago,
so I didn't get much.

01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:45.582
I understand.

01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:54.917
Tomorrow is D-Day.

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:56.792
Can you do it?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:58.958
I'd better.

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:02.375
I promised to kill him with my own hands.

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:21.708
You want him dead, right?

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:24.667
Make it look like Ji-sung
and Jang shot each other.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:26.750
Pardon?

01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:29.750
You'll be a free man from that moment.

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:43.375
They left.

01:10:43.542 --> 01:10:44.792
They left.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:49.208
We're following them with GPS.
You can move ahead.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:50.458
Okay.

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:52.583
We'll join you at the Incheon tollgate.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.000
You get nervous too?

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.874
You must be happy,

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:07.708
everything will end today.

01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:13.583
Let's do it.

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:23.292
<i>They turned right, keep your distance.</i>

01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:28.750
We're in Chinatown.

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:30.874
<i>Alright, we're in, too.</i>

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:33.250
<i>We'll be on their tail
after the intersection.</i>

01:11:33.417 --> 01:11:34.417
Okay.

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:43.833
He's making a stop, we'll just pass.

01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:58.250
He went into a restaurant.

01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:00.542
This must be the place.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.250
<i>Sir.</i>

01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:04.167
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:09.957
<i>- You're exercising?
- Yeah, wait a bit.</i>

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:10.958
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:13.333
It's not the restaurant,
there's no other noise.

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:16.792
The basement, let's move.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:30.458
Yes, sir.

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:31.666
<i>Standby nearby.</i>

01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:33.542
Move in if something goes wrong.

01:12:34.042 --> 01:12:36.208
We'll wipe them out at your signal.

01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:52.207
Found it. I'll check it out.

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:53.542
I need diversion.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.208
My god! That's cold!

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:01.667
Holy shit!

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:04.125
- Are you okay, miss?
- Don't touch me!

01:13:04.667 --> 01:13:06.042
I'll clean it for you.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:08.375
I'm so sorry.

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:10.583
- It's clean.
- What?

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:31.417
The door is locked.

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:34.708
Wait until they come out.

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.833
Handle it as quietly as possible.

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:40.166
<i>So, how's the prep going?</i>

01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:42.667
<i>I will contact him soon.</i>

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:46.208
<i>Here, the certificates of deposit.</i>

01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.833
<i>Let him handle it.</i>

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.417
<i>$30 million could be too risky.</i>

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:55.208
<i>Launder it, it's been 8 long years.</i>

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:59.667
<i>How much would you like to
launder in Korea this time?</i>

01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:02.000
<i>$300 million.</i>

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:04.749
<i>Make no mistake.</i>

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.375
<i>We're leaving Korea for good.</i>

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.792
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:10.458
<i>I'll come find you once it's done.</i>

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:13.917
<i>Alright, thanks.</i>

01:14:15.833 --> 01:14:17.708
They'll come out soon, get ready.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.500
<i>Hold.</i>

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:35.917
Pull out.

01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:38.542
What are you talking about?

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:40.667
Do as I say, pull out now!

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:42.583
- <i>Now!</i>
- No.

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.125
I'm ending this now.

01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:47.375
Ko Seok-dong!

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.917
$300 million...

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:57.958
Can you handle this?

01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:01.208
We found his hideout,
we can move in anytime.

01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:03.875
Okay.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.500
Once this thing wraps,

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.875
I'll make you Prosecutor General.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:14.167
I don't need that anymore.

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:18.750
Once you become president,
hand over your district to me.

01:15:23.542 --> 01:15:28.125
Sure, a man must have big ambitions.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:44.125
Hey! What the hell?!

01:15:44.542 --> 01:15:46.125
That was our chance!

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:55.292
We get the money first.

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:58.500
You want to scam Jang?

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:02.750
You're a crazy bastard.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.125
You guys go ahead,
I'll go kill him though.

01:16:08.292 --> 01:16:11.167
On your own? You really think you can?

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.542
Why? Wanna kill me?

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.125
Then who'll contact Kwak and get the money?

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:26.250
Don't be too greedy. I'll never do it.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:30.000
You don't need the bribery list?

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:38.333
You weren't in Thailand,
you dug around with Choi.

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:42.583
That's right.

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:46.792
Did you think that I'd be
done after killing Jang?

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:50.583
I'll kill everyone who was
bribed and helped Jang flee.

01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:53.542
I'll give you that list.

01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:59.208
There's one other person
who knows about the list.

01:17:04.417 --> 01:17:08.208
If you get the list and kill Jang,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.917
then you get everything you wanted.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.708
You think I'll buy that?

01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:18.292
It's your call.

01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:22.595
I'd like to apologize for our last meeting.

01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:24.167
I'm sorry.

01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:27.083
The deal is off the table.

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:32.875
I'll get to the point.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.958
Liquidate our CDs.

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.958
<i>Certificate of Deposit</i>

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.042
Are you kidding me?

01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:42.874
For $100K,

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:44.792
you can take it to any bank.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:46.625
Don't mess with him!

01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:51.707
- We've got a lot more.
- How many?

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:53.875
How much can you liquidate?

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:56.000
Give me your best shot.

01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:09.208
300 CDs.

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:13.750
Excuse me for a second.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.917
Where's that bastard going?

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:30.125
What? You don't want the list?

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.917
Let's raise the stakes to $300 million.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.167
But our cut is 50%.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Deal?

01:18:44.542 --> 01:18:46.208
Or should I call it quits?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.250
30%,

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:52.625
and the bribery list.

01:18:59.292 --> 01:19:00.374
Deal!

01:19:00.375 --> 01:19:02.750
You can all take 10% each,
I just want the list.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:20.542
If a large sum is liquidated in a
short period, it'll be flagged.

01:19:20.708 --> 01:19:22.625
I want a safe route.

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:26.625
Then we go through the
private loan market.

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:28.542
That's my specialty.

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:31.292
It'll take 2 weeks. My commission is 10%.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:34.083
Can you do it in a week?

01:19:36.375 --> 01:19:37.375
Take it.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:38.750
Yes.

01:19:39.083 --> 01:19:40.375
Thank you.

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:51.000
Is this all?

01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:54.207
$30 million for low level fucks?

01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:58.208
It's a total rip-off. Where's the rest?

01:19:58.542 --> 01:19:59.917
After this is all over.

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.624
We have to give him real
money on the first deal,

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:08.499
then we get the rest of his $270 million.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.917
I'll take care of it.

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:13.000
How will you make him
entrust the rest to us?

01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:18.082
Kwak'll start shell corporations
with the laundered money.

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:19.541
When funneling money as capital,

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:23.292
there'll be less suspicion,
so he'll launder the rest himself.

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:25.666
I knew it, that's pretty obvious.

01:20:25.667 --> 01:20:29.125
If his plan goes awry,
we become his only way.

01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:32.083
Lure him into our trap?

01:20:32.792 --> 01:20:34.083
It's your turn.

01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:36.750
Show us how much power you can muster.

01:20:46.417 --> 01:20:47.625
Take them all!

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.541
What is it?

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:54.875
Search warrant, please comply.

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.917
<i>I e-mailed you Jang's list.</i>

01:21:08.542 --> 01:21:09.874
<i>Jang's Bribery List Revealed</i>

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:13.792
<i>Jang Doo-chil's bribery list
was revealed by Hansin Daily.</i>

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:17.292
<i>It names dozens of civil servants
in public sectors.</i>

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.707
<i>This list will have wide
implications going forward.</i>

01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:21.625
<i>Councilor, it's an emergency.</i>

01:21:21.626 --> 01:21:22.906
<i>The list is out, please call me.</i>

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.375
<i>Jang's bribery list leaked this morning</i>

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:27.542
<i>has not been verified,</i>

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:32.250
<i>as the outlet refuses to
provide us with their source.</i>

01:21:38.292 --> 01:21:40.375
What the fuck have you done?!

01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:43.500
You said you took care of it!
Where did it come from?

01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:46.625
This won't end just with your dismissal!

01:21:58.417 --> 01:22:00.958
I never told you to stir up the media.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.500
They're just small timers.

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.333
It's the only way to kill him
and get the money too.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.458
Are you sure you can handle this?

01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:13.917
Jang's the one who'll take the heat.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:19.583
They'll be forced to go all-in.

01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:22.000
Sir!

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:24.667
Kwak's gone!

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:34.416
Our bugs and GPS aren't picking him up.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.041
His number is dead.

01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:38.416
Did he get scared and flee to Thailand?

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:40.042
Don't jinx it!

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.500
Why else would he sever
all communication?

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.333
We're closed for today...

01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:16.833
Hey! You son of a bitch!

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:20.833
What's your plan now?

01:23:21.417 --> 01:23:23.625
What's your next move, asshole!

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:34.917
<i>Restricted Number</i>

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.500
I should probably answer that.

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:48.667
<i>It's Kwak Seung-gun.</i>

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.208
Mr. Kwak?

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.292
<i>I had to change my number
due to an urgent matter.</i>

01:23:57.458 --> 01:23:58.792
Is there a problem?

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:02.292
<i>I have to fly out on an urgent business.</i>

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:07.083
<i>Can you prepare $30 million by tomorrow?</i>

01:24:07.667 --> 01:24:08.667
Tomorrow?

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:10.916
<i>If you can do it,</i>

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:12.958
<i>I'll entrust you with
the rest of our funds.</i>

01:24:14.958 --> 01:24:18.458
- How much is that?
<i>- $270 million.</i>

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:26.792
Alright, I'll try my best.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.792
<i>Thank you, I will call you again.</i>

01:24:31.917 --> 01:24:35.125
As expected, they'll
take off with the money.

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.792
And the cash? Can you get it ready?

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.292
We hand them $30 million
and get the rest of CDs.

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.250
Do whatever it takes to find Jang

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:50.708
by using Kwak.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.208
I need some cash by tomorrow morning.

01:24:57.833 --> 01:25:00.375
- What?
- $30 million.

01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:04.832
Pool the money you all
received from Jang.

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.583
I'll cover the rest.

01:25:11.875 --> 01:25:14.208
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:17.083
You think you're safe with
Councilor Sung's support?

01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:22.125
- Then pull out.
- You son of a...

01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:29.000
You crazy bastard!

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:33.917
What do you think I'm
fucking doing here?

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:38.875
I'm trying to clean
up your goddamn shit!

01:25:41.958 --> 01:25:47.458
At the very least do your damn part.

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.292
Work!

01:25:50.917 --> 01:25:51.917
Work!

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:02.000
If you want to keep what you got, okay?

01:26:08.542 --> 01:26:09.542
Yes, sir.

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:11.542
We can secure the funds by tomorrow.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:15.291
<i>What are you going to do about the media?</i>

01:26:15.292 --> 01:26:18.416
One of Jang's men has been
bragging about the list.

01:26:18.417 --> 01:26:20.625
We'll say he leaked the fake list,

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.917
and the buzz will die soon.
It's not a big deal.

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.542
Drink it.

01:27:03.625 --> 01:27:05.125
But, sir...

01:27:06.667 --> 01:27:09.374
Have I done anything wrong?

01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:10.708
Write this down.

01:27:15.792 --> 01:27:18.750
I won't endure my shame any longer now,

01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:22.125
for even a gust of wind
pained me terribly.

01:27:40.667 --> 01:27:42.667
Fucking shit!

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.583
You sons of bitches!

01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:47.250
You bastard!

01:27:57.167 --> 01:27:58.917
Suicide Note

01:28:06.708 --> 01:28:08.333
Why! Why!

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:11.583
Why did you have to
spread baseless rumors?

01:28:14.417 --> 01:28:16.000
I'll tell you everything!

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.292
That bastard told me to!

01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:25.167
Open up.

01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:35.792
Say it again.

01:28:39.208 --> 01:28:40.625
Please don't kill me!

01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:42.375
Please, sir!

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:46.417
I was paid to do what I did.

01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:50.375
What?

01:28:50.376 --> 01:28:52.625
That bastard Choi Chang-sik!

01:28:56.167 --> 01:29:00.625
You'll get double, if you spread
the rumor about the list.

01:29:04.083 --> 01:29:05.792
But you said he conned you.

01:29:06.333 --> 01:29:10.292
He promised me more money
after my release from jail

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.000
and just disappeared.

01:29:16.625 --> 01:29:18.375
He approached you on purpose?

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:32.167
Please don't kill me!

01:30:19.542 --> 01:30:22.917
<i>The $270 million, when can you do it?</i>

01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:25.042
<i>Such a big sum takes time.</i>

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:27.750
<i>I must fly out tomorrow night.</i>

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:30.333
<i>I'll get you as much as I can first.</i>

01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:32.333
The rendezvous point?

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:38.667
Magumpo Port.

01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.083
They're smuggling out.

01:31:00.583 --> 01:31:03.125
We'll finish Jang tomorrow at Magumpo.

01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:09.000
No need for that.

01:31:34.083 --> 01:31:35.417
Gotcha!

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:44.750
Yes?

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.042
We found him.

01:31:46.125 --> 01:31:48.292
Bring me Jang, dead or alive.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:49.750
Yes, sir.

01:31:57.625 --> 01:31:59.292
So we got the money

01:31:59.958 --> 01:32:02.042
and we got Jang too.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.292
There's no need for you anymore.

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:14.167
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:17.250
Why? Something's broken?

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:21.375
No, it's not.

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:32.958
You should've behaved yourself!

01:32:33.417 --> 01:32:35.457
How do you feel?

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.042
You regret it a bit now?

01:32:38.208 --> 01:32:40.292
Spend the rest...

01:32:41.083 --> 01:32:43.667
of your life cleaning
up other people's shit.

01:32:43.833 --> 01:32:45.917
You cheap bastard.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:57.625
Conniving son of a bitch!

01:32:58.875 --> 01:33:00.792
Watch your mouth!

01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:05.458
How dare you talk back at me!

01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:18.917
Keep running your mouth.

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:35.958
Yes, is it done?

01:33:35.959 --> 01:33:39.333
<i>Sir, Jang has disappeared.</i>

01:33:40.167 --> 01:33:42.792
<i>And the money's gone too.</i>

01:33:55.375 --> 01:33:58.833
We missed him slipping
out this way, sorry sir.

01:34:01.083 --> 01:34:03.333
I am really sorry, sir.

01:34:07.667 --> 01:34:09.666
Don't fool around everywhere,

01:34:09.667 --> 01:34:12.625
just come to Magumpo
tomorrow with your gang.

01:34:14.167 --> 01:34:15.542
Yes, sir.

01:34:20.958 --> 01:34:22.042
Who is it?

01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:26.667
<i>So the rats on my tail were your men?</i>

01:34:27.958 --> 01:34:29.292
Jang Doo-chil!

01:34:38.042 --> 01:34:40.583
<i>What? Wanna kill me?</i>

01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:45.125
<i>Damn, I can never trust anyone.</i>

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:47.750
<i>As if taking my money wasn't enough?</i>

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:49.958
<i>You're not afraid of me?</i>

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:55.375
Fuck you! Hey, Jang Doo-chil!

01:34:55.792 --> 01:34:58.292
Do I look like a chump
because I spared you?

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:02.500
You think I'm easy? Crazy bastard!

01:35:03.958 --> 01:35:08.082
<i>So you don't mind
releasing my ledger then?</i>

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.375
Suit yourself.

01:35:09.875 --> 01:35:12.374
It'll freak out the old farts,
but it won't hurt me.

01:35:12.375 --> 01:35:14.957
I will kill you, though.

01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:17.417
<i>I'm so scared!</i>

01:35:18.125 --> 01:35:19.500
<i>Was I right?</i>

01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:23.041
You son of a bitch!
What are you doing now?

01:35:23.042 --> 01:35:26.167
Mr. Jung, we have nothing to do with it.

01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:27.250
<i>What should I do?</i>

01:35:27.583 --> 01:35:30.708
<i>Should I release the list
with your permission?</i>

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.124
<i>It'll be a bloodbath.</i>

01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:36.416
<i>Mr. Jang, don't make this into a big deal.</i>

01:35:36.417 --> 01:35:38.000
<i>That hurts my feelings.</i>

01:35:38.167 --> 01:35:43.625
<i>That depends on how you
deal with your barking mutt!</i>

01:35:43.833 --> 01:35:45.207
<i>No more mistakes.</i>

01:35:45.208 --> 01:35:48.583
<i>Lee, if you don't take care of this,</i>

01:35:48.833 --> 01:35:50.166
I will finish you personally.

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:52.708
Park, you bastard, get back here now!

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.167
I'll deliver you Jang's head.

01:36:11.542 --> 01:36:13.958
Lure Jang to Magumpo tomorrow.

01:36:16.417 --> 01:36:18.042
Crazy son of a bitch.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.792
You think I'll do it?

01:36:27.958 --> 01:36:29.625
You will die if you don't.

01:36:31.833 --> 01:36:33.708
You'll kill me anyway.

01:36:41.292 --> 01:36:42.333
That's right.

01:36:43.083 --> 01:36:48.917
Wouldn't you like to die
after killing Jang?

01:36:53.167 --> 01:36:54.792
Not gonna get your revenge?

01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:06.250
Are you okay?

01:37:11.333 --> 01:37:13.417
Stop here and run away.

01:37:14.417 --> 01:37:15.957
You should live first.

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:18.750
That's right, do as she says.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:22.583
Unlike you, we can't flee anyway.

01:37:23.792 --> 01:37:25.083
No.

01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:27.708
I have to finish this.

01:37:34.958 --> 01:37:37.124
You got the wrong person.

01:37:37.125 --> 01:37:41.000
The man who killed your
father was someone else.

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:03.374
<i>That bastard lured my father,</i>

01:38:03.375 --> 01:38:05.542
<i>and he killed him to shut him up for good.</i>

01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:11.042
I'm sorry for not telling you.

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:38.542
I must pay back to him for my life.

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:45.167
I need your help.

01:39:04.625 --> 01:39:08.125
Surprised? Prosecutor Park had those.

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:12.499
Oh yeah, those are copies, of course.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.208
Are you okay with everything?

01:39:14.875 --> 01:39:17.125
What do you want?

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.249
<i>Why don't we talk face-to-face?</i>

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:22.082
Men are all the same...

01:39:22.083 --> 01:39:24.333
The Prosecutor General
said the same thing.

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:28.208
Fine, come alone.

01:39:35.708 --> 01:39:37.708
In a lump sum, in USD.

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.500
Okay!

01:39:51.292 --> 01:39:53.666
But it's quite a sum this time?

01:39:53.667 --> 01:39:56.208
We can't do it all at once.

01:39:56.792 --> 01:39:59.333
A $100 million advance,
and the rest in 6 months.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.292
We're here.

01:40:31.833 --> 01:40:33.791
The warehouse next to the dock.

01:40:33.792 --> 01:40:35.500
<i>I'll see you in a bit.</i>

01:40:37.875 --> 01:40:39.792
He'll arrive soon.

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.542
Great, then it's all done now?

01:40:44.875 --> 01:40:46.583
Give us our share and the list.

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.624
List? What list?

01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:52.417
You're a dead man, what's the point?

01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:59.375
You'll regret this.

01:41:00.958 --> 01:41:04.750
You don't mind me exposing
what you've done?

01:41:12.917 --> 01:41:15.625
You're going all-out over this, right?

01:41:20.958 --> 01:41:23.374
I retrieved all documents
meant for the media.

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:24.750
Ko Seok-dong, you bastard!

01:41:28.417 --> 01:41:30.250
Thanks for your service.

01:41:31.292 --> 01:41:32.292
Get rid of them.

01:41:33.167 --> 01:41:34.375
Wait, please!

01:41:34.792 --> 01:41:37.083
Sir! Sir!

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:07.666
Hey, Jung.

01:42:07.667 --> 01:42:11.083
<i>Mr. Prosecutor, what are
you trying to pull?</i>

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:15.542
These looked so real, I almost got fooled.

01:42:16.792 --> 01:42:17.708
What are you talking about?

01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:19.791
What am I talking about? Shit!

01:42:19.792 --> 01:42:23.458
These're counterfeits!

01:42:26.792 --> 01:42:28.083
<i>The deal's off!</i>

01:42:28.292 --> 01:42:30.624
<i>I need my advance back.</i>

01:42:30.625 --> 01:42:32.125
<i>You'll need to pay some penalty.</i>

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:39.083
If you mess with me again, I'll end you.

01:42:40.792 --> 01:42:42.125
<i>Understood?</i>

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:45.417
Goddammit!

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.750
Sir! They're here.

01:43:35.083 --> 01:43:38.832
Hey, Jang Doo-chil...

01:43:38.833 --> 01:43:41.041
Jang Doo-chil! You dare try to fool me?

01:43:41.042 --> 01:43:43.042
Where's the money, bastard?

01:43:54.917 --> 01:43:55.958
What's this?

01:43:56.833 --> 01:44:00.083
Did I surprise you?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.417
You trusted me?

01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:08.792
A swindler?

01:44:09.375 --> 01:44:11.791
Don't trust that prick.

01:44:11.792 --> 01:44:14.457
He's always hiding a step.

01:44:14.458 --> 01:44:16.500
<i>Let's clear one thing first.</i>

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:19.625
I'll set up the plan,
and we'll do it my way.

01:44:22.667 --> 01:44:25.250
I'll go to Thailand while she's on him.

01:44:26.458 --> 01:44:27.499
What? He's not in Thailand?

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.250
He's meeting that swindler.

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:58.167
Damn! You son of a bitch!

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.083
Hey!

01:45:02.792 --> 01:45:03.792
You bastard.

01:45:08.458 --> 01:45:09.833
And that's a wrap.

01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:19.458
Ko Seok-dong!

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.208
You!

01:45:41.708 --> 01:45:44.208
Tae-dong!

01:45:45.625 --> 01:45:46.750
Tae-dong!

01:45:47.417 --> 01:45:49.708
How the hell...

01:45:55.417 --> 01:45:57.417
Tae-dong!

01:46:03.208 --> 01:46:06.542
Honey! No! Please no!

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.500
You can't do this!

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:15.375
You're saying this prosecutor

01:46:15.917 --> 01:46:17.707
helped Jang run away?

01:46:17.708 --> 01:46:20.291
Let's just kill them all!

01:46:20.292 --> 01:46:22.292
Killing them is easy.

01:46:22.875 --> 01:46:24.874
<i>My dad told me.</i>

01:46:24.875 --> 01:46:27.666
<i>Fool me once, shame on you,</i>

01:46:27.667 --> 01:46:30.875
<i>fool me twice, shame on me.</i>

01:46:32.417 --> 01:46:36.250
I'll fool them over and over again,

01:46:37.125 --> 01:46:39.167
and make them pay.

01:46:44.458 --> 01:46:47.667
Do a year for all of us.

01:46:47.875 --> 01:46:48.875
Okay.

01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:50.999
At least I don't have
to worry about food.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.708
I rotted in jail for a year
because of you, bastard!

01:46:54.958 --> 01:46:57.833
<i>It grows every single day.</i>

01:46:58.750 --> 01:47:00.875
We will grow it into a
successful company...

01:47:03.958 --> 01:47:07.167
Here, the certificates of deposit.

01:47:07.333 --> 01:47:11.874
How much would you like to
launder in Korea this time?

01:47:11.875 --> 01:47:13.375
$300 million.

01:47:13.792 --> 01:47:16.375
You don't need the bribery list?

01:47:18.042 --> 01:47:21.791
<i>Thanks to your greed, we
got everything we wanted.</i>

01:47:21.792 --> 01:47:22.917
$30 million.

01:47:26.042 --> 01:47:29.667
Now the world will know what you've done.

01:47:30.042 --> 01:47:31.708
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

01:47:41.958 --> 01:47:43.500
That's all?

01:47:44.375 --> 01:47:49.250
You planned all this
over a petty swindler?

01:47:54.333 --> 01:47:55.417
Shoot me.

01:48:00.042 --> 01:48:01.125
Shoot!

01:48:03.542 --> 01:48:05.083
Pull the trigger, bastard!

01:48:05.667 --> 01:48:07.083
Do it!

01:48:20.208 --> 01:48:22.250
You think Night Fog died because of me?

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.167
No way.

01:48:24.583 --> 01:48:28.083
Several powerful men
were blindsided by Jang,

01:48:28.792 --> 01:48:31.375
and they killed him to cover it all up.

01:48:33.042 --> 01:48:37.917
They control the media, do you
think the truth will prevail?

01:48:39.250 --> 01:48:40.667
So what?

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.792
Give me the evidence.

01:48:48.208 --> 01:48:49.958
I will get them all.

01:48:56.083 --> 01:48:57.667
There's no need.

01:48:59.917 --> 01:49:01.667
Thank you for waiting.

01:49:04.042 --> 01:49:05.541
You son of a bitch!

01:49:05.542 --> 01:49:09.583
You're backstabbing us
after all we did for you?

01:49:13.875 --> 01:49:15.832
I'll make it up to you.

01:49:15.833 --> 01:49:17.874
I'll get Jang no matter what,

01:49:17.875 --> 01:49:21.458
and compensate his victims
by creating a law,

01:49:22.208 --> 01:49:24.125
so please give me a chance!

01:49:31.833 --> 01:49:33.791
Freeze!

01:49:33.792 --> 01:49:35.208
Drop your weapons!

01:49:35.458 --> 01:49:36.792
Hands in the air!

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.042
Over here please!

01:49:40.417 --> 01:49:42.250
Do you have anything to say?

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:46.707
You scored a big scoop!

01:49:46.708 --> 01:49:48.875
It's an utter chaos!

01:50:01.708 --> 01:50:04.542
What are you staring at? Surprised?

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.958
Shit, I feel so good.

01:50:08.375 --> 01:50:09.625
What's up?

01:50:10.292 --> 01:50:11.624
Big news!

01:50:11.625 --> 01:50:16.000
<i>An online broadcast went
live at 9:30 this evening...</i>

01:50:16.208 --> 01:50:18.957
<i>The video is going viral...</i>

01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:21.874
<i>The broadcast is still live</i>

01:50:21.875 --> 01:50:23.416
<i>and shows presidential candidate...</i>

01:50:23.417 --> 01:50:25.707
<i>Prosecutor Park Hee-su</i>

01:50:25.708 --> 01:50:28.792
<i>confessed his involvement...</i>

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.082
Enjoy it.

01:50:50.083 --> 01:50:51.833
It'll be hell till the day you die.

01:51:48.708 --> 01:51:50.375
Holy cow!

01:51:51.083 --> 01:51:52.500
When did you get out?

01:51:55.417 --> 01:51:56.666
It wasn't too hard?

01:51:56.667 --> 01:51:58.124
I brought something good.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:51:59.625
It's tofu.

01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:03.457
You got old really fast.

01:52:03.458 --> 01:52:04.917
You'll be single for good.

01:52:08.625 --> 01:52:09.625
Right, honey?

01:52:10.208 --> 01:52:11.208
What is it?

01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:14.582
Why are you all here?

01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:16.458
He's lost touch with the game.

01:52:16.792 --> 01:52:18.042
Can't you tell?

01:52:41.042 --> 01:52:42.542
One more bastard left.

01:52:42.917 --> 01:52:44.208
Mastermind it.

01:52:45.305 --> 01:52:51.306
