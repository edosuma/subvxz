<i>...reckless sinful
way throughout this life.</i>

00:46.078 --> 00:47.511
<i>The Lord has told me</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.845
<i>that the open
gates of Hell</i>

00:49.882 --> 00:52.578
<i>are yawning up
widely in our path.</i>

00:52.618 --> 00:54.483
<i>Yes, the flames</i>

00:54.520 --> 00:56.613
<i>of perpetual damnation</i>

00:56.656 --> 00:59.625
<i>are ever ready to grasp
our souls.</i>

00:59.659 --> 01:02.787
<i>We know the way
of the righteous man.</i>

01:02.828 --> 01:04.887
<i>Yeah, we know the prayer</i>

01:04.931 --> 01:06.592
<i>of the righteous man.</i>

01:15.875 --> 01:19.140
<i>I'm telling you
that the Lord has spoken.</i>

01:19.178 --> 01:22.306
<i>Yes, the Lord has spoken
to me.</i>

01:46.472 --> 01:48.235
Hi.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.333
Mike Enslin.
Checking in.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.901
Honey.
Mr. Enslin.

01:52.945 --> 01:54.503
We were afraid you
weren't going to show.

01:54.547 --> 01:57.243
Oh it's such an honor
to have you here.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.148
- Terrible night out there.
- If I could just get the key,

01:59.185 --> 02:00.880
I'll settle in and we can
talk in the morning after...

02:00.920 --> 02:03.013
You probably want to hear
all about our haunted history.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.353
Well, this staircase here,
this is where the maid

02:05.391 --> 02:07.689
reputedly hung herself
in 1860.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.160
- Oh.
- There's a picture!

02:09.195 --> 02:10.685
- Can we do this in the morning?
- Wait wait.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.595
It's printed in
our brochure.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.122
- Did we send you one of these?
- Uh, probably did.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.862
- Do you see her in the window?
- Yeah, there she is.

02:16.902 --> 02:19.894
That's a photo that
a guest took in 1986.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.907
In your letter
you mentioned that the rooms

02:21.941 --> 02:23.909
with the most
paranormal activity

02:23.943 --> 02:25.968
were in the attic.
Could I have one of those rooms?

02:26.012 --> 02:28.480
That's right, because the attic
is on the third floor

02:28.514 --> 02:30.641
which is the former
servant's quarters.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.117
People say that all
of Sylvia's children

02:33.152 --> 02:36.019
died up there
of tuberculosis.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.888
- All of them?
- Guests have reported strange sounds.

02:38.924 --> 02:41.518
At the stroke of midnight
there's been weird noises.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.188
Now our best advice
is to lock your door from the inside.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.891
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

02:45.931 --> 02:48.491
You take care, you just
lock it from the inside.

02:48.534 --> 02:50.263
I will.

02:50.302 --> 02:52.133
As soon as you
give me the key.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.707
I'm so... right.
Got it right here.

02:57.743 --> 03:00.644
- Number 14, you can't miss it.
- Been a long drive.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.648
- Good luck.
- All right, we'll see

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
what the night brings.

04:17.289 --> 04:18.483
Mrs. Clark, the proprietor,

04:18.524 --> 04:20.185
says she hasn't
slept a night

04:20.226 --> 04:23.059
since acquiring the inn
and I believe her.

04:23.095 --> 04:25.427
No no no,
I pity her.

04:25.464 --> 04:28.126
But in any case, the eggs
Benedict are delicious

04:28.167 --> 04:30.294
and if you call in advance,
Mrs. Clark says

04:30.336 --> 04:33.897
she will bake her famous
flourless chocolate cake.

04:33.939 --> 04:37.932
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping
Beach Inn six skulls.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.072
Screw 'em, five skulls.

04:55.027 --> 04:57.325
- Hi.
- Oh hey.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.025
How's it going?
Can I help you?

05:00.065 --> 05:01.498
Yeah, I'm here
for the big event.

05:01.534 --> 05:05.300
All right.
Cool.

05:05.337 --> 05:06.668
I'm Mike Enslin.

05:06.705 --> 05:08.798
Sorry?

05:10.176 --> 05:11.541
- Book signing.
- Oh, right.

05:11.577 --> 05:15.035
Oh, that's you, yeah.
I see the resemblance, yeah.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.139
- That's a good picture.
- Thanks, man.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.741
All right, hold on.

05:18.784 --> 05:21.912
Um... attention,
book lovers.

05:21.954 --> 05:25.412
Tonight we have noted
occult writer

05:25.457 --> 05:27.288
Michael Enslin

05:27.326 --> 05:30.056
at the Author's Corner
tonight.

05:30.095 --> 05:33.360
He's the writer of the best-selling
ghost survival guides,

05:33.399 --> 05:36.732
um... with such titles
as "10 Haunted Hotels,"

05:36.769 --> 05:39.897
"10 Haunted Graveyards,"

05:39.939 --> 05:41.497
"10 Haunted Lighthouses."

05:41.540 --> 05:43.974
That's tonight, 7:00 pm.

05:44.009 --> 05:46.273
Anyway, so I really
enjoyed writing it,

05:46.312 --> 05:48.246
and that's kind of
a history of the book.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.374
And I hope you enjoy it,
or enjoyed it.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.908
Uh, you know,
stay scared.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.352
Right?
Any questions?

05:55.387 --> 05:57.685
Where's the scariest place
you've ever been?

05:57.723 --> 05:59.850
Scariest place
I've ever been?

05:59.892 --> 06:01.883
Uh, I've never heard
that question before.

06:01.927 --> 06:04.122
That's a joke.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.495
Well, all these places have
very colorful histories.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.090
Um...

06:08.133 --> 06:10.226
I would say, if I had to
pick a top one,

06:10.269 --> 06:12.260
I would say
Bar Harbor,

06:12.304 --> 06:15.330
the site of the grisly
McTeig wedding night murders.

06:15.374 --> 06:18.070
That's an intense place.
Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota,

06:18.110 --> 06:21.011
where the crazed war widow
threw her baby down a well.

06:21.046 --> 06:23.378
I mean, those all have a lot
of... I mean, it's thick.

06:23.415 --> 06:26.213
- The air is thick.
- What about poltergeists?

06:26.252 --> 06:29.119
Look, I'm a good researcher.
I go into every gig locked and loaded.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.385
I travel with an EMF meter,
full-range spectrometer,

06:32.424 --> 06:35.120
infrared camera. I mean, look,
nothing would make me happier

06:35.160 --> 06:37.094
than to experience
a paranormal event,

06:37.129 --> 06:39.859
you know, to get a glimpse
of the elusive light

06:39.899 --> 06:41.264
at the end of the tunnel.

06:43.168 --> 06:45.466
So you're saying there's
no such thing as ghosts?

06:46.605 --> 06:48.266
I'm saying
I've never seen one,

06:48.307 --> 06:50.673
but they're awful convenient
for desperate hotels

06:50.709 --> 06:52.904
when the interstate moves away.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.641
This thing has really
gone off the rails. Who has a pen?

06:55.681 --> 06:58.241
- I do.
- Which one?

06:58.284 --> 07:01.515
Uh, but seriously, Mike,
if I want to see a real live ghost,

07:01.553 --> 07:03.316
where's my best bet?

07:03.355 --> 07:04.652
- Guaranteed?
- Yeah.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.248
Haunted Mansion,
Orlando.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.487
Awesome, thanks.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.087
- Stay scared.
- Thank you.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.961
Hey, Ray, can you lock up?

07:12.998 --> 07:15.933
I got band practice tonight.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.595
Holy shit.

07:17.636 --> 07:19.126
What rock did you
find that under?

07:19.171 --> 07:21.196
- Um, eBay.
- eBay, huh?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.265
How much did it go for?

07:23.309 --> 07:25.834
Well, there weren't
many bidders.

07:25.878 --> 07:28.312
I would think not.

07:28.347 --> 07:31.316
- Wow.
- But it's, um...

07:31.350 --> 07:33.079
- an amazing book.
- Oh.

07:33.118 --> 07:35.882
Um, so... unique

07:35.921 --> 07:38.856
and inspirational
and honest.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.586
Thanks.
What's your name?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.651
- Um, Anna.
- Okay, Anna.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.788
Are you gonna write another
one like this one?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.661
Nah, it's
a different guy.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.667
Um...

07:48.701 --> 07:50.669
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

07:50.703 --> 07:54.036
Um, the relationship
in the book

07:54.073 --> 07:56.769
with the father and the son...
it's probably too personal,

07:56.809 --> 08:00.404
- but, um, it's so authentic and...
- Mm-hm.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.006
well-constructed,
and...

08:03.048 --> 08:05.949
is it true?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.613
No.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.815
Well, thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

08:10.856 --> 08:12.221
My pleasure.

08:12.257 --> 08:13.815
Bye.

08:30.275 --> 08:32.708
- Good boy!
- Yo, homey...

08:32.745 --> 08:34.871
Just a minute, Tiffany!

08:34.913 --> 08:37.177
Yeah, I'm just gonna tie it
inside my suit here.

09:35.874 --> 09:37.865
Yo, Greg, check him out!

09:37.910 --> 09:39.639
Did you see what happened?

09:39.678 --> 09:41.543
Oh yeah.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.406
Are you okay, buddy?

09:45.451 --> 09:48.443
Hey, are you breathing?

09:52.991 --> 09:55.255
- No!
- Serious as a heart attack.

10:00.933 --> 10:05.597
We got 325.
That is back here, I think.

10:05.637 --> 10:07.400
Uh-huh.

10:07.439 --> 10:10.237
This is the one.
Sign on the line, please, sir.

10:10.275 --> 10:11.833
Oh, you mean
right here?

10:11.877 --> 10:14.710
- Have yourself a beautiful day.
- Thank you.

10:14.746 --> 10:17.010
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, man, you've been gone a while.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.347
- Hey, Jackson, what's up?
- Oh by the way, dude,

10:19.384 --> 10:22.353
I read your last book...
the "10 Haunted Mansions" thing.

10:22.387 --> 10:23.979
Man, that's some
scary shit.

10:24.022 --> 10:26.320
Cool.

10:26.358 --> 10:27.985
Later on, dude.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.389
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

10:33.432 --> 10:35.593
- Hi.
- Good.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.465
Thanks.

11:24.349 --> 11:26.146
That's cute.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.382
Good evening, Dolphin Hotel.

11:29.421 --> 11:30.945
How might I direct
your call?

11:30.989 --> 11:32.854
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about room 1408.

11:32.891 --> 11:34.654
One moment please, sir.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.026
How may I help you?

11:38.063 --> 11:40.554
Yeah, I'd like to stay in
room 1408 please.

11:40.599 --> 11:44.057
That room is
unavailable, sir.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.434
I didn't tell you
which date.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.706
How about Saturday?

11:49.741 --> 11:51.504
It's unavailable.

11:53.645 --> 11:56.478
The following Tuesday?

11:56.515 --> 11:58.244
Unavailable.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.046
Next month?

12:00.085 --> 12:01.552
Unavailable.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.782
Next summer?

12:29.748 --> 12:32.649
Somebody, anybody,
where's good Chinese near 48th?

12:32.684 --> 12:34.982
I got to have lunch with
that idiot from Random House. Anybody?

12:35.020 --> 12:37.011
Sam, Mike Enslin calling
from Los Angeles again.

12:37.055 --> 12:39.455
I'll take it in there.

12:39.491 --> 12:40.924
Clay, you got a sec for
Mike Enslin?

12:40.959 --> 12:42.426
- Say yes.
- Yes.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.986
Great. Now look, this guy
tends to get a little morose,

12:45.030 --> 12:47.294
so try to keep the energy up.
Otherwise he stews in his own funk.

12:47.332 --> 12:48.629
- Mike!
- Hey, Sam.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.794
Hey hey, read the first
five chapters last night.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.463
Spooky shit,
couldn't sleep a wink.

12:52.504 --> 12:54.438
Great. Hey, did you take care
of that thing?

12:54.473 --> 12:57.442
You'd better believe I did.
And I got our top lawyer here right now.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.602
Mike, Clay,
Clay, Mike.

12:58.644 --> 12:59.872
- Hi, Clay.
- Mike.

12:59.911 --> 13:01.776
Talk fast, all right?
This guy's $400 an hour.

13:01.813 --> 13:03.303
All right, Clay,
what's up with the Dolphin?

13:03.348 --> 13:04.747
Yeah, the Dolphin.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.343
That stick-up-its-ass
relic on Lexington.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.411
Too posh for
a free plug, right?

13:09.454 --> 13:11.718
Well, you are gonna love
what Clay's cooked up.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.282
He dug around and found you...
are you sitting down?

13:14.326 --> 13:16.760
- a Federal
Civil Rights law.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.820
Like somebody would
discriminate against you,

13:18.864 --> 13:21.958
a well-to-do white guy.
But the law's the law, right, Clay?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.661
Ergo, if the room's
not occupied

13:23.702 --> 13:25.670
- they have to give it to you.
- Really?

13:25.704 --> 13:27.968
Yeah. Now look, the manager there's
gonna put up a stink

13:28.006 --> 13:29.234
but he knows the drill.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.673
- Nothing you can't handle.
- So, Mike...

13:30.709 --> 13:32.233
we'll book the room
and if they refuse

13:32.277 --> 13:34.142
we'll rattle our sabers
and file suit.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.647
- So it's all done?
- Thanks, Clay. Get lost, all right?

13:36.682 --> 13:38.741
Bye, Clay.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.116
Yeah, Mike,
are you there?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.520
Yeah, uh, on a more
personal note,

13:44.556 --> 13:46.080
are you sure
you want to come here?

13:46.124 --> 13:48.991
Yeah, of course. It'll make a solid
closing chapter of the book.

13:49.027 --> 13:51.723
Yeah yeah,
I know the routine.

13:51.763 --> 13:54.755
But, I mean,
it's New York.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.701
All that happened... you really want
to put yourself through that?

13:57.736 --> 14:00.034
- I'll be quick.
- Are you gonna call Lily?

14:00.072 --> 14:03.041
No.
I don't want to impose.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.169
In and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.944
It's just a job.

14:21.693 --> 14:23.388
Here you are, Dolphin.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.057
Hey! Taxi!

14:46.051 --> 14:48.618
It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

14:48.653 --> 14:50.245
Pardon me, ladies.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.169
Thanks very much.

15:05.203 --> 15:06.693
Welcome to
the Dolphin, sir.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.706
- Are you checking in?
- Mike Enslin.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.968
One night.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.499
And how are we
spelling that today?

15:12.544 --> 15:14.808
- N-S-L-I-N?
- N-S-L-I-N.

15:14.846 --> 15:16.040
Yeah.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.850
Uh, would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

15:23.889 --> 15:25.618
Sure.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.753
Mr. Dempsey, Mike Enslin's
just checked in.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.265
- Where is he?
- He's over at my desk.

15:34.299 --> 15:36.699
That's fine, Marie.
I'll take care of it.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.100
Okay.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.499
It'll just be a minute,
Mr. Enslin.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.914
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you with your bag?

15:52.951 --> 15:55.419
- No.
- Very well.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.984
Mr. Enslin,
I'm Gerald Olin,

16:00.025 --> 16:01.788
manager of
the Dolphin.

16:01.827 --> 16:04.762
If there's anything that I can do
for you while you're here...

16:04.796 --> 16:07.060
dinner reservations,
theater tickets,

16:07.098 --> 16:08.827
maybe a Knicks game?
Anything...

16:08.867 --> 16:10.858
just tell me.
I am at your service.

16:10.902 --> 16:14.030
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408,
I can get out of your hair.

16:14.072 --> 16:17.803
Oh, we were thinking
of upgrading you to a penthouse suite.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.368
1408, please.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.539
Insistent,
aren't we?

16:22.581 --> 16:24.446
Could you please
humor me

16:24.483 --> 16:28.476
by coming to my office for a more
private conversation?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.920
- Sure.
- Excellent.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.460
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

16:39.197 --> 16:41.028
1408 a smoking room?

16:41.066 --> 16:43.364
As a matter of fact,
it is. Yes.

16:43.401 --> 16:46.802
Good, one less worry in
the watches of the night.

16:46.838 --> 16:48.772
Care for a cigar?

16:48.807 --> 16:50.934
No thank you,
I don't smoke.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.739
Oh this, yeah.
That's...

16:52.777 --> 16:55.211
in case nuclear war
breaks out.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.407
I gave it up
a long time ago.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.313
It's part habit,
part superstition.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.715
It's, you know,
a writer thing.

16:59.751 --> 17:01.514
You do drink,
don't you?

17:01.553 --> 17:03.316
Of course, I just said
I was a writer.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.654
Le Cinquante Sept
Deces, 1939.

17:06.691 --> 17:08.488
Exquisite.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.722
About $800 a bottle,
when you can find it.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.628
I appreciate the bribe,
but I intend on staying in that room.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.992
- How long?
- How long?

17:18.002 --> 17:19.630
My usual is
overnight.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.638
I see.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.506
No one's ever lasted
more than an hour.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.477
Jesus, man.

17:26.511 --> 17:28.569
You ought to shave your eyebrows
and paint your hair gold

17:28.613 --> 17:31.104
if you're gonna try
to sell that spookhouse bullshit.

17:31.149 --> 17:32.582
Otherwise, you'll
scare the children.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.676
Why are you mocking me
when I am genuinely,

17:34.719 --> 17:36.914
to the best of my ability,
trying to help you?

17:36.955 --> 17:38.684
No, you're playing
a little game.

17:38.723 --> 17:40.953
You're selling
the mystique.

17:40.992 --> 17:43.392
But eventually,
we both know

17:43.428 --> 17:45.953
you're gonna give me the key
and I'm gonna go up to the room

17:45.997 --> 17:48.693
and I'm gonna write my story
and your bookings are gonna go up 50%.

17:48.733 --> 17:52.066
Do you mind if my little friend records
our conversation?

17:54.873 --> 17:56.272
I'll take that as a yes.

17:56.308 --> 17:59.709
Sir, you quite
misunderstand the situation.

17:59.744 --> 18:03.043
Now, I know the Dolphin
doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza

18:03.081 --> 18:04.776
or the Carlyle,

18:04.816 --> 18:07.944
but we operate
at 90% capacity.

18:07.986 --> 18:09.146
Always.

18:09.187 --> 18:11.849
And my concern here
is not for the hotel.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.415
My concern here
is not for you.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.723
Frankly, selfishly,

18:16.761 --> 18:19.730
I don't want you
to check into 1408

18:19.764 --> 18:22.096
because I don't want
to clean up the mess.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.534
Now hotels are all
about presentation

18:25.570 --> 18:28.130
and fertile
creature comforts.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.142
My training is
as a manager,

18:31.176 --> 18:33.144
not a coroner.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.477
Under my watch there have
been four deaths... four.

18:36.514 --> 18:39.074
After the last one,
I forbade any guest

18:39.117 --> 18:41.381
from checking
into 1408 ever again.

18:41.419 --> 18:44.752
The last one was David Hide,
orthodontist, manic-depressive.

18:44.789 --> 18:46.916
Slit his wrist,
did a little self-surgery,

18:46.958 --> 18:48.425
turned himself into
a eunuch, right?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.951
Yes. So you've
done your homework.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.122
I'm a professional too.

18:52.163 --> 18:55.064
Well, grievously, in its
95-year existence,

18:55.100 --> 18:57.500
the hotel has seen
seven jumpers,

18:57.535 --> 18:59.560
four overdoses,
five hangings,

18:59.604 --> 19:00.832
- three mutilations...
- Three mutilations...

19:00.872 --> 19:02.567
two stranglings.
General manager Gerald Olin

19:02.607 --> 19:04.734
is well-versed in
the hotel's tragic history,

19:04.776 --> 19:07.574
dryly reciting the docket
of carnage like a bookkeeper

19:07.612 --> 19:09.341
discussing his ledger.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.440
Well, you think
you're clever, don't you?

19:11.483 --> 19:12.814
I know the game.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.250
Well, during
your investigation,

19:14.285 --> 19:16.776
did you discover
the 22 natural deaths

19:16.821 --> 19:18.812
that have occurred
in 1408?

19:20.592 --> 19:21.923
Natural deaths?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.292
Ah, didn't find out
about them

19:24.329 --> 19:27.856
because the newspapers don't
print anything about them.

19:27.899 --> 19:31.232
Hmm. All told,
there have been 56 deaths

19:31.269 --> 19:32.702
in 1408.

19:32.737 --> 19:35.968
56?
You're shitting me.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.804
You don't know anything.

19:37.842 --> 19:40.868
The causes of death
in 1408 range

19:40.912 --> 19:43.346
from heart attack,
stroke, drowning...

19:43.381 --> 19:46.077
- Drowning?
- Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller

19:46.117 --> 19:48.244
drowned
in his chicken soup.

19:48.286 --> 19:50.652
That's hard to do.
How... how did he do that?

19:50.689 --> 19:52.281
How indeed?

19:52.323 --> 19:55.315
Interesting.
It's all in here.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.727
I will let you have this
and give you access to my office.

19:58.763 --> 20:01.095
You can take notes,
put it all in your book.

20:01.132 --> 20:03.327
My only condition

20:03.368 --> 20:07.065
is that you do not
stay in that room.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.801
You'll let me look
at all that stuff?

20:09.841 --> 20:11.832
Hmm.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.520
I never did
get that drink.

20:41.139 --> 20:44.472
- Oh, that is good.
- Here, keep it.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.534
Compliments
of the house.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.851
- I'm still staying.
- Damn it to hell!

20:59.891 --> 21:01.791
I'm sorry.

21:01.826 --> 21:04.886
All right here.
Here, read the godforsaken thing.

21:04.929 --> 21:07.022
I guarantee you,
once you've read it

21:07.065 --> 21:09.431
you won't want to stay
in 1408.

21:11.402 --> 21:13.666
The first victim:
Mr. Kevin O'Malley,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.502
sewing machine salesman.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.405
Checked into the hotel
the first week it opened...

21:17.442 --> 21:20.377
- October, 1912.
- Cut his own throat, right?

21:20.411 --> 21:21.969
Oh, that's not
the horrific part.

21:22.013 --> 21:24.038
Afterwards, in a fit
of insanity,

21:24.082 --> 21:26.516
he tried to stitch
himself back together

21:26.551 --> 21:28.985
using an old sewing needle
before he bled to death.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.715
Easy, man.

21:30.755 --> 21:33.747
Look, Mr. Enslin,
you don't have to stay in 1408.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.817
You can take
photographs of 1404.

21:35.860 --> 21:39.387
It has the exact same layout and no one
will ever know the difference.

21:39.430 --> 21:42.092
- My readers expect the truth.
- Your readers?

21:42.133 --> 21:44.931
Your readers expect
grotesqueries

21:44.969 --> 21:47.130
and cheap thrills.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.902
"The headless ghost
of Mr. Eugene Rilsby

21:49.941 --> 21:51.704
still walks
his abandoned farmhouse."

21:51.743 --> 21:55.179
"The Barking Phantom
of Mount Hope Cemetery."

21:55.213 --> 21:56.942
A direct quote...
how'd you know that?

21:56.981 --> 21:58.744
Your books aren't
hard to find.

21:58.783 --> 22:00.648
They're on the bargain
shelves

22:00.685 --> 22:03.415
of any paperback
novel store;

22:03.454 --> 22:06.981
full of cynicism,
written by a talented, intelligent man

22:07.025 --> 22:09.687
who doesn't believe
in anything or anyone but himself.

22:09.727 --> 22:12.628
Guilty as charged.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.462
Hey listen, this meeting's over.
Why don't you give me the room?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.991
Oh please, don't act
like a hurt schoolgirl.

22:18.036 --> 22:21.096
- In fact, you surprised me.
- Oh.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.972
You are not
the hack-n-slash I expected.

22:24.008 --> 22:26.602
I rather liked the first one,
the hardcover.

22:26.644 --> 22:30.341
What was it called?
"The Last Walk..."

22:30.381 --> 22:31.678
"Long Road Home."

22:31.716 --> 22:34.685
"The Long Road Home,"
yes.

22:34.719 --> 22:37.187
I rather thought
the father was a bastard.

22:37.222 --> 22:39.122
Yeah, he was.

22:41.226 --> 22:42.693
Look man, just
give me the key.

22:42.727 --> 22:45.821
- Mr. Enslin...
- Just give me the key!

22:45.864 --> 22:48.890
Listen, I stayed
at the Bigsby house.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.868
I brushed my goddamn teeth
right next to the tub

22:51.903 --> 22:54.201
where Sir David Smith
drowned his whole family.

22:54.239 --> 22:57.208
And I stopped being afraid
of vampires when I was 12.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.803
Do you know why I can stay
in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin?

23:00.845 --> 23:03.643
Because I know that
ghoulies and ghosties

23:03.681 --> 23:05.979
and long-legged beasties
don't exist.

23:07.118 --> 23:08.608
Even if they did,

23:08.653 --> 23:11.247
there's no God to protect
us from them, is there?

23:12.991 --> 23:14.982
So I can't talk you
out of this?

23:15.026 --> 23:17.586
I think we've reached
an understanding.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.063
Very well.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.658
Come with me.

23:34.512 --> 23:36.946
Most hotels have
switched to magnetics.

23:36.981 --> 23:40.417
An actual key.
That's a nice touch... it's antiquey.

23:40.451 --> 23:44.012
We have magnetic cards also, but
electronics don't seem to work in 1408.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.920
Hope you don't have
a pacemaker.

23:45.957 --> 23:48.926
General manager claims that the phantom
in room interferes...

23:48.960 --> 23:51.053
I have never used
the word "phantom."

23:51.095 --> 23:53.563
Oh, I'm sorry.
Spirit? Specter?

23:53.598 --> 23:55.122
No, you misunderstand.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.430
Whatever's in 1408
is nothing like that.

23:57.468 --> 24:00.266
Then what is it?

24:00.305 --> 24:02.739
It's an evil
fucking room.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.803
Please.

24:10.548 --> 24:14.143
Mr. Odin.

24:14.185 --> 24:16.983
Oh, oui.
Tres bien.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.985
Why don't the owners
just close the room?

24:26.664 --> 24:29.132
The Yasuko Corporation
prefers to pretend there's no problem.

24:29.167 --> 24:32.159
Just as they pretend
there's no 13th floor.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.773
The room,
it's got to be filthy.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.002
I mean, the sheets haven't been changed
in what? 11 years?

24:38.042 --> 24:40.977
No no no,
we're very professional.

24:41.012 --> 24:44.448
1408 gets a light
turn once a month.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.712
I supervise, the maids
work in pairs.

24:46.751 --> 24:49.515
We treat the room
as if it's a chamber

24:49.554 --> 24:51.078
filled with poison gas.

24:51.122 --> 24:54.819
We only stay 10 minutes
and I insist the door remain open.

24:54.859 --> 24:57.225
But still...

24:59.530 --> 25:02.158
A few years ago, a young
maid from El Salvador

25:02.200 --> 25:03.758
found herself locked
in the bathroom.

25:03.801 --> 25:05.029
She was only there
for a few moments,

25:05.069 --> 25:07.060
but when we pulled
her out, she was...

25:07.105 --> 25:09.835
- She was dead.
- No, blind.

25:09.874 --> 25:12.069
She had taken a pair
of scissors

25:12.110 --> 25:14.078
and gouged
her eyes out.

25:14.112 --> 25:16.478
She was laughing hysterically.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.812
- Ouch.
- Your floor.

25:19.984 --> 25:21.611
Well, this is where
we part company.

25:21.652 --> 25:24.883
This is as close
as I get to 1408

25:24.922 --> 25:26.981
unless it's that time
of the month.

25:28.893 --> 25:31.623
- See you tomorrow.
- Mr. Enslin?

25:31.662 --> 25:33.630
Please...

25:33.664 --> 25:35.632
don't do this.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.838
I'll call you about
those Knicks tickets.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.181
Stop it!

27:11.162 --> 27:13.995
Okay. It's okay, sweetie.
We're home now.

27:14.031 --> 27:15.123
Here we go.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.058
This is it?

28:23.067 --> 28:25.729
You got to be kidding me.

28:41.719 --> 28:45.018
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin
for effective aggressiveness.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.389
I have to admit,
he had me going for a moment.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.493
But where is
the bone-chilling terror?

28:52.530 --> 28:55.294
Show me the rivers
of blood.

29:01.272 --> 29:03.740
It's just a room.

29:48.653 --> 29:51.918
$8 for beer nuts.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.481
This room is evil.

29:54.525 --> 29:57.585
Olin said hotels are about
fertile creature comforts.

29:57.628 --> 29:59.926
It's a good line,
but I wonder

29:59.964 --> 30:02.762
whether they're really
about reassuring platitudes,

30:02.800 --> 30:05.291
a prosaic sense
of the familiar.

30:05.336 --> 30:08.703
"Yes, I've
been here before.

30:08.739 --> 30:11.867
It's safe."

30:11.909 --> 30:14.400
There's a sofa,

30:14.445 --> 30:17.937
a writing desk,
a faux antique armoire,

30:17.982 --> 30:20.109
floral wallpaper.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.517
Carpet's unremarkable,
except for a stain

30:22.553 --> 30:25.750
beneath a thrift-store painting
of a schooner lost at sea.

30:25.790 --> 30:29.089
The work is done in the
predictably dull fashion

30:29.126 --> 30:30.991
of Currier and Ives.

30:31.028 --> 30:33.519
The second painting
is of an old woman

30:33.564 --> 30:35.794
reading bedtime stories...
a Whistler knockoff...

30:35.833 --> 30:37.596
to a group
of deranged children

30:37.635 --> 30:41.332
as another Madonna and child
watch from the background.

30:41.372 --> 30:45.035
It does have
the vague air of menace.

30:45.076 --> 30:49.137
The third and final
painfully dull painting

30:49.180 --> 30:51.171
is the ever-popular "The Hunt."

30:51.215 --> 30:53.843
Horses, hounds
and constipated British lords.

30:53.884 --> 30:56.944
Some smartass spoke about
the banality of evil.

30:56.987 --> 30:59.046
If that's true,

30:59.090 --> 31:01.854
then we're in
the seventh circle of Hell.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.296
It does have
its charms.

31:14.672 --> 31:17.835
The panorama is typically cramped
New York City view of nothing:

31:17.875 --> 31:20.571
Dull, grey
buildings all around;

31:20.611 --> 31:23.876
Honking traffic below.
The view of a...

31:27.318 --> 31:31.448
Holy shit.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.042
Bravo, Olin.
That is very unsettling.

32:06.624 --> 32:08.888
That means
someone's in the room.

32:12.129 --> 32:15.394
Hello?

32:15.433 --> 32:16.593
Hello!

32:20.171 --> 32:21.297
Whoa.

32:25.943 --> 32:27.376
That is bizarre.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.816
Finally I got
something to write about.

32:33.851 --> 32:36.319
A ghost that offers
turn-down service.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.520
All right.

32:41.559 --> 32:44.392
All right, let's Encyclopedia
Brown this bitch.

32:44.428 --> 32:46.396
Started off the window,

32:46.430 --> 32:48.455
hear the music,
nab my head.

32:48.499 --> 32:50.967
I turn around, go to
the bed for the chocolate.

32:51.001 --> 32:52.969
Then I go into the closet
which would have...

32:53.003 --> 32:54.994
my back was turned.
It would have let

32:55.039 --> 32:58.406
Houdini have time to come in
here do the paper trick...

32:58.442 --> 33:01.070
and he's in the living room.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.621
Out!

33:23.534 --> 33:25.001
Huh.

33:31.642 --> 33:33.371
Hello?

33:43.020 --> 33:45.750
You're gonna have to
try harder, asshole!

33:45.789 --> 33:47.814
Nice and warm
for you up there?

33:47.858 --> 33:49.519
It's hot down here,
bubba.

33:58.869 --> 34:00.530
Come on.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.952
- Front desk.
- Hello, this is Mike Enslin.

34:17.987 --> 34:20.286
- Guess which room.
- Good evening, sir.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.315
- Good evening.
- Are you ready to check out?

34:22.359 --> 34:24.224
Check out?
No no no no no.

34:24.261 --> 34:26.058
Check out, check out, no.
Why would I check out?

34:26.096 --> 34:29.532
Especially with this wonderful
maid service. It's so discreet.

34:29.567 --> 34:32.161
No no no, I need you to send somebody
to fix my thermostat.

34:32.202 --> 34:34.466
- Room's on fire.
- Of course, sir.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.063
We'll send an engineer
right up.

34:36.106 --> 34:38.574
- You will?
- Absolutely.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.371
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:22.486 --> 35:24.920
How many thin walls

35:24.955 --> 35:27.150
have we put up
with together,

35:27.191 --> 35:29.182
old boy?

35:30.194 --> 35:33.027
How many sarcophagal chambers?

35:36.767 --> 35:38.997
Hotel rooms are a naturally
creepy place...

35:40.004 --> 35:41.562
don't you think?

35:41.605 --> 35:43.937
I mean, how many people
have slept in that bed before you?

35:43.974 --> 35:45.566
How many of them
were sick?

35:45.609 --> 35:47.839
How many of them
lost their minds?

35:50.047 --> 35:53.244
How many of them... died?

35:55.219 --> 35:57.483
We came here
to get the story,

35:57.521 --> 36:00.388
and we don't rattle,
do we?

37:26.110 --> 37:29.011
It's not that what
I'm seeing is not real.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.310
It just ain't as real
as it seems.

37:35.719 --> 37:37.550
Hello?

37:37.588 --> 37:40.148
You got a problem
with the temperature?

37:46.096 --> 37:47.393
Yeah.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.960
Come on.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.337
Is it too hot
or too cold?

37:59.376 --> 38:01.276
What does it look like?

38:01.311 --> 38:03.404
Come on in.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.312
The box is
right over here.

38:05.349 --> 38:06.873
It's stuck around 80.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.079
I said the box
is right here.

38:12.122 --> 38:14.716
I know where the hell it is,
but I ain't going in this room.

38:16.093 --> 38:18.584
You just have to walk
six or seven feet.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.120
I said I ain't going in.
You know what happened in here?

38:21.165 --> 38:22.393
Yes, I'm well aware
of that.

38:22.432 --> 38:24.297
Look, I'll talk
you through it.

38:24.334 --> 38:26.461
Any jackass can fix
that thing.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.368
Just remove the panel.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.171
Okay, now above that coil

38:35.212 --> 38:36.975
is a little tube
filled with mercury.

38:37.014 --> 38:39.448
That's supposed to activate
the contact switch.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.611
But this hotel's so goddamn old,
half the shit in here don't work.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.314
Just give the tube
a little tap.

38:44.354 --> 38:45.946
Just tap the damn thing!

38:48.225 --> 38:49.988
Yeah, there it is.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.461
Oh, sir,
you're a genius.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.487
A gentleman and a scholar.

38:54.531 --> 38:56.021
Thank you.
Let me give you...

38:57.100 --> 38:58.499
a tip.

39:01.305 --> 39:02.863
Sir?

39:41.378 --> 39:43.312
Son of a...

40:04.768 --> 40:06.963
Nobody lasts
more than an hour.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.642
Very effective.

40:51.848 --> 40:53.748
Oh fuck!
Jesus!

40:55.085 --> 40:56.677
Oh, God.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.314
Ow!
Son of a...

41:16.173 --> 41:19.142
Ow! Fuck!
Agh!

41:22.612 --> 41:24.807
Ow!
God!

42:10.360 --> 42:13.090
Hello?

42:17.167 --> 42:19.032
- Hello?
- Sir, I'm afraid there was

42:19.069 --> 42:20.934
a miscommunication
in the kitchen.

42:20.971 --> 42:23.132
There's going to be a 10-minute delay
with your sandwich.

42:23.173 --> 42:24.299
Sandwich?
What sandwich?

42:24.341 --> 42:26.206
I didn't order any sandwich.
What are you talking about?

42:26.243 --> 42:27.733
I'm sorry.
You're welcome to substitute

42:27.778 --> 42:29.746
a side dish for
your French fries.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.805
We have cottage cheese,
macaroni salad,

42:31.848 --> 42:33.782
- coleslaw...
- Listen to me. You win.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.751
I'm checking out.
I'm hurt.

42:35.786 --> 42:38.016
Do you understand?
My goddamn hand is hurt.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.819
I understand. If you leave your dry
cleaning out by 10:00 AM,

42:40.857 --> 42:42.984
we'll have it pressed
and returned by 5:00...

42:43.026 --> 42:45.324
Shit, bitch! Call me a cab
to the nearest hospital!

42:45.362 --> 42:48.297
I'm hurt! Do you comprehend
what I'm telling you?

42:48.331 --> 42:51.494
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking
to me in that tone of voice.

42:51.535 --> 42:54.470
You're an idiot!
I'm gonna sue your ass!

42:54.504 --> 42:56.938
I'm gonna take legal action!
What's wrong with you?

42:56.973 --> 43:00.204
If you wish, I can connect you
with our manager Mr. Olin.

43:00.243 --> 43:02.370
Good! Good good good
good good! Put him on.

43:02.412 --> 43:04.607
Put him on. I'm gonna blitz
the son of a bitch.

43:04.648 --> 43:06.513
Olin... good!
Put him on now!

43:08.552 --> 43:10.782
When staying at
the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy

43:10.821 --> 43:13.756
New York's finest dining at the fabled
Sea Bream restaurant

43:13.790 --> 43:15.951
on our mezzanine level.
Muscles tense?

43:15.992 --> 43:18.460
Then make an appointment
to visit our deluxe spa

43:18.495 --> 43:20.292
on the Coral level.
With full massage,

43:20.330 --> 43:21.922
facial and aromatherapy
facilities,

43:21.965 --> 43:24.126
- it will leave you feeling relaxed...
- Hello?

43:24.167 --> 43:27.159
and revitalized.
Your call is important to us...

43:27.204 --> 43:28.933
You bitch.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.601
You win.
You win.

43:31.641 --> 43:33.836
All right.
Okay!

43:35.879 --> 43:38.109
Come on.
Come on!

43:56.366 --> 43:57.993
Come on.
Come on.

44:07.911 --> 44:09.469
Hey!

44:09.513 --> 44:11.310
Help!
Help!

44:24.094 --> 44:26.858
Help! Help!

44:29.099 --> 44:30.828
Can anybody hear me?

44:30.867 --> 44:33.335
Help!

44:34.504 --> 44:38.065
You! Sir!
Sir! Help!

44:39.976 --> 44:41.443
Yeah!
Yeah, you! Help!

44:41.478 --> 44:44.504
Help! Help!
You, sir!

44:45.749 --> 44:48.377
Help!
Can you see me?

44:48.418 --> 44:51.649
Yeah!
The Dolphin Hotel!

44:51.688 --> 44:53.588
Call the police!

44:55.659 --> 44:57.320
Help!

45:00.363 --> 45:01.955
Help!

45:40.971 --> 45:42.768
Hey!
Look out!

46:11.701 --> 46:14.101
Hey!

46:31.087 --> 46:33.282
I'm losing my mind.

46:33.323 --> 46:34.950
I can see you, Dad.

46:40.263 --> 46:43.130
Daddy?
Daddy, where are you?

46:45.168 --> 46:47.796
I'm gonna get you.

46:48.838 --> 46:50.328
Ready or not,

46:50.373 --> 46:52.307
here I come.

46:59.149 --> 47:01.344
Here you are.

47:01.384 --> 47:04.217
I see you, Daddy.

47:06.423 --> 47:08.516
Get ahold of yourself.

47:08.558 --> 47:10.822
You're running to places
that aren't real.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.987
Get up. Get up.

47:15.665 --> 47:17.223
You're losing the plot.

47:21.871 --> 47:24.704
You're losing
the whole goddamn structure.

47:24.741 --> 47:28.108
Daddy! Find me.

47:28.144 --> 47:31.113
Psychokinetic
fibrillations.

47:31.147 --> 47:34.378
A tired mind among classic haunted-house
powers of suggestion.

47:34.417 --> 47:36.317
Gaslit features,
faded rugs,

47:36.353 --> 47:38.480
like that motel
in Kansas.

47:38.521 --> 47:41.217
There's a reason for everything.
Just think.

47:43.993 --> 47:45.893
What's that?

47:46.930 --> 47:50.058
What is that?
Is that a spycam?

47:50.100 --> 47:53.627
Who is that?
Are you enjoying this?

47:53.670 --> 47:56.571
Is that the sadistic owner
of the hotel or is that Olin?

47:59.909 --> 48:01.809
Wait a minute.

48:03.279 --> 48:05.144
He gave me booze.

48:05.181 --> 48:07.843
He gave me booze.
Did he take a sip?

48:09.152 --> 48:11.017
I can't remember.

48:13.289 --> 48:14.950
He dosed me!

48:14.991 --> 48:17.084
It was the booze
or the chocolates.

48:17.127 --> 48:19.095
Never take candy
from strangers.

48:19.129 --> 48:21.825
All right, all right.
I'm just hallucinating.

48:21.865 --> 48:24.095
I'm just hallucinating.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.567
I've just got to
ride this out.

48:25.602 --> 48:27.069
I've got to
ride this out

48:27.103 --> 48:29.594
for four or five hours
and I'm straight. Okay.

48:31.007 --> 48:32.372
You can do this.

48:34.144 --> 48:35.873
Oh, man. I'm gonna get you.

48:35.912 --> 48:38.472
You are finished.
Come here. Come here!

48:38.515 --> 48:41.916
Dad! Sit down!

48:41.951 --> 48:43.543
You want me to sit down?

48:45.121 --> 48:46.520
You want me to sit down?

48:46.556 --> 48:48.148
- Yes!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

48:48.191 --> 48:49.715
Let me find a good...

48:49.759 --> 48:51.420
let me find a good
frame here.

48:53.396 --> 48:55.159
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:55.198 --> 48:58.258
welcome to the Most
Ugliest Person Competition.

48:59.436 --> 49:00.903
Fifth and fourth place

49:00.937 --> 49:03.371
goes to Boris and Doris
the goldfish.

49:03.406 --> 49:07.809
Ladies and gentlemen!
Let's get a closeup of those guys.

49:07.844 --> 49:09.709
Let's have a closeup
of Boris and Doris.

49:09.746 --> 49:12.544
Look at that.
Those are some ugly fish.

49:12.582 --> 49:14.948
They're so ugly
they're running from you.

49:14.984 --> 49:16.952
Third place
goes to Mike Enslin.

49:16.986 --> 49:18.715
Surprise surprise.

49:18.755 --> 49:21.815
Right, how's this for ugly?

49:26.095 --> 49:28.563
Second place
goes to Lily Enslin.

49:28.598 --> 49:31.726
That was good.

49:31.768 --> 49:35.329
That's kind of like Beowulf
meets a redneck.

49:35.371 --> 49:39.569
- I like it.
- And first place goes to Katie Enslin.

49:41.845 --> 49:43.870
That is a terror.
That is...

49:43.913 --> 49:46.108
oh, God! Don't show
me that face!

49:46.149 --> 49:47.810
Oh, I can't look
at it again.

49:49.352 --> 49:51.445
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.251
Whatever you do,
don't show us that face.

51:03.726 --> 51:06.160
Ma'am, can you hear me?

51:09.365 --> 51:11.265
Ma'am, I need your help.

51:12.435 --> 51:14.232
Please, ma'am,
can you hear me?

51:16.539 --> 51:19.337
Kid, be quiet.

51:19.375 --> 51:21.275
Please, ma'am.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.942
Quiet!

52:19.068 --> 52:21.866
I... wish...

52:22.872 --> 52:25.636
I was dead.

52:28.911 --> 52:31.004
Where's my garden?

52:32.615 --> 52:35.345
I can't smell anything.

52:35.385 --> 52:38.377
I hate this place.

52:43.526 --> 52:45.517
How did I get here?

52:49.599 --> 52:51.464
Pop.

52:51.501 --> 52:53.162
Dad.

52:54.470 --> 52:56.199
It's Michael.

53:08.384 --> 53:10.818
As you are...

53:10.853 --> 53:13.481
I was.

53:16.159 --> 53:18.252
As I am...

53:21.531 --> 53:24.193
you will be.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.580
Maybe I'm not real.

53:50.026 --> 53:52.119
Maybe I'm just
having a nightmare...

53:54.664 --> 53:56.928
an incredibly vivid

53:56.966 --> 53:59.400
lucid nightmare.

54:01.938 --> 54:04.498
When is the last time
I remember going to bed?

54:06.843 --> 54:08.777
I flew in yesterday.

54:09.912 --> 54:13.211
Or was that... today?

54:14.217 --> 54:16.185
I can't remember.

54:16.219 --> 54:18.210
Was I on a train?

54:21.758 --> 54:23.453
I woke up somewhere

54:23.493 --> 54:25.552
and I had breakfast.

54:25.595 --> 54:28.428
Where was I?
What did I eat?

54:36.405 --> 54:37.895
Here it comes.

55:00.730 --> 55:03.893
They say you can't die
in your dreams.

55:03.933 --> 55:05.457
Is that true?

55:24.921 --> 55:28.413
The shock
would wake you up.

55:32.995 --> 55:36.021
So you couldn't
really die.

55:40.603 --> 55:42.468
All right,
what are our options?

55:42.505 --> 55:45.963
Got the hallway,
got guest rooms on either side,

55:46.008 --> 55:49.102
stairwell,
fire exits.

55:49.145 --> 55:50.908
And that's
the next window...

55:52.348 --> 55:53.838
the next room.

55:55.318 --> 55:58.776
How many feet across
is that?

55:58.821 --> 56:00.482
One...

56:02.425 --> 56:04.017
...three,

56:04.060 --> 56:05.584
four, five,

56:05.628 --> 56:09.655
six, seven, eight...

56:09.699 --> 56:11.030
nine.

56:12.034 --> 56:14.935
Nine, nine...
18 feet across.

56:17.707 --> 56:20.835
Okay.
I can do this.

56:26.449 --> 56:29.350
If something should happen,
if I should slip and fall,

56:29.385 --> 56:32.548
I want it to be known
that it was an accident.

56:33.723 --> 56:35.657
The room...

56:35.691 --> 56:37.556
did not win.

56:39.095 --> 56:40.722
Okay.

56:40.763 --> 56:42.628
Okay, I can do this.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.799
18 little steps.

56:53.776 --> 56:55.744
Four...

56:55.778 --> 56:58.178
Don't look down.
Five...

56:59.448 --> 57:01.348
Keep moving.

57:05.755 --> 57:07.620
Here we go.

57:13.296 --> 57:15.992
All right.
Okay.

57:16.032 --> 57:17.693
Number nine...

57:17.733 --> 57:19.257
eight...

57:21.137 --> 57:22.502
six...

57:26.409 --> 57:28.877
Where is it?
Where is it?

01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:07.268
Get ahold of yourself.

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.396
You're running to places
that aren't real.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.403
Hotel rooms are naturally
creepy places.

01:00:19.548 --> 01:00:22.346
Strangely, the bedroom
has no window.

01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:26.613
Strangely, the bedroom has no window...

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.958
Dr. Edwards to Oncology.

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:37.464
Please, please.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:47.304
No. No. Doctors don't
know everything.

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.311
We can get another opinion,
look for other treatment.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.711
- You hear about...
- Look at me.

01:00:51.747 --> 01:00:53.271
...miracle cures.
- Lily.

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:56.580
Oh God.
Please, something.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:01:00.248
What kind of god would
do this to a little girl?

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:10.395
Katie.

01:01:10.432 --> 01:01:14.596
Daddy, I can't see you.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:17.800
Daddy, I can't find you.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.308
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:22.867
- Katie.
- I'm scared, Daddy.

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.971
Help.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.743
Help me.

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:28.647
Daddy, help me.

01:02:05.754 --> 01:02:07.619
Okay, how about
the wireless?

01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:09.146
Come on.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:18.830
Give me a signal.
Give me a signal.

01:02:18.867 --> 01:02:21.199
Good evening, Mike.

01:02:22.304 --> 01:02:23.771
Oh, yes!

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.906
Mike?

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.573
Mike, is that...
is that you?

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.343
- I can barely see you.
- Yes yes.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:36.818
- It's like seeing a ghost.
- No no no. Yes, it's me.

01:02:36.852 --> 01:02:38.683
- It's me. It's Mike.
- This is a little bizarre.

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.848
I mean, I haven't talked
to you in a year

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.948
and suddenly you pop up
in a box on my computer.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:45.324
I'm sorry, Lily.
Listen to me, please, quickly.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.955
Look, I'm at work, okay? So why don't
you call me at home tonight?

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:51.489
I'm trapped in this room,
this place.

01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.728
Mike, you're always trapped in weird
places. That's your job.

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.634
No no, please, Lily. Listen to me.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.502
- Please.
- Lily Enslin.

01:02:57.539 --> 01:02:59.507
- Hi. Yeah yeah.
- Lily!

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.600
- I've got those. I'll be right down.
- No. Lily!

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.942
Lily, please!
Call the cops.

01:03:03.979 --> 01:03:06.379
Send them
to the Dolphin Hotel.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.144
I'll call you back.

01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:12.914
- You're in the city?
- Yes!

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:15.446
- 2254 Lexington.
- What are you doing in New York?

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:18.927
I'll tell you later.
The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.929
- That's just perfect.
- Please.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.794
You walk out, you disappear.
Leaving me what?

01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:25.095
Not divorced. Separated?
I don't know, it's not clear.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.864
- Suddenly you need me?
- Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here.

01:03:27.903 --> 01:03:30.667
- I'm in danger. You understand?
- Okay, Mike. Slow down.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:31.934
You're not making
any sense.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:35.102
There's something trying
to kill me right now.

01:03:39.014 --> 01:03:40.777
No, Lily!

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.943
No no no!

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.709
I've got a knife!

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.321
That's the way out.

01:05:03.365 --> 01:05:05.424
Or that way.
Or that way.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.631
All right,
that's the way out.

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.266
Lady, let me in!

01:05:13.308 --> 01:05:17.039
- Help! Help!
- Please, sleep.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.809
- Lady, I'm coming through!
- Mike!

01:05:19.848 --> 01:05:23.011
Mike, can you help me?
Where'd you go?

01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:26.487
I got to get some cigarettes.
You want something?

01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:30.589
Jesus Christ!

01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:34.423
I've got to go. I'll be in California.

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.397
Mike, you can't do this.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.662
She needs you.
She lost a kid too.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.168
You've got an amazing talent
for stating the obvious, Pop.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.431
You think
I don't know that?

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.462
I'm trying to talk
some sense into your head!

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:47.270
- Don't put your hands on me, old man!
- Mike!

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:50.437
Talk? Why change what appears to be
the habit of a lifetime, Pop?

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:51.912
You were always great
at passing judgment,

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.847
but the problem is
you never gave a shit.

01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:56.817
I never gave a shit
because you're a bullshit writer!

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.721
Shit!

01:06:10.899 --> 01:06:12.423
Hello!

01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:18.899
Oh.

01:06:43.932 --> 01:06:45.297
Kevin O'Malley.

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:57.705
No.

01:06:57.746 --> 01:06:59.714
No no no no no no.

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:03.341
I can't help you.

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:04.818
I can't help you.

01:07:06.321 --> 01:07:08.881
No!

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:07.140
It's good to be back.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.649
That's enough of that.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.428
Alcohol.

01:08:26.468 --> 01:08:28.527
I was just checking to see
if the accommodations

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.162
are exceeding
your expectations.

01:08:30.205 --> 01:08:32.399
You know goddamn well
they are!

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:35.308
- What do you want from me?
- No no no.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.676
What do you want?

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.408
What do you want,
Mr. Enslin?

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:43.111
- You sought this room.
- It was a job. I was doing the job.

01:08:43.151 --> 01:08:45.176
- I beg your pardon?
- My job! I'm a writer.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.189
Oh, that's right.
You don't believe in anything.

01:08:48.223 --> 01:08:49.917
You like shattering
people's hopes.

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.255
Oh, that's bullshit!

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:53.055
Why do you think people
believe in ghosts?

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.461
For fun?
No.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.933
It's the prospect
of something after death.

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:02.198
How many spirits
have you broken?

01:09:02.237 --> 01:09:04.033
She was in so much pain.

01:09:04.072 --> 01:09:06.131
I'm sure she's smiling down
on us right now.

01:09:06.174 --> 01:09:09.143
What do you want
from me?

01:09:09.176 --> 01:09:10.474
Huh?

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:13.537
What do you want
from me?

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.243
You...

01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:17.548
you little...

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.149
What do you want?

01:09:23.191 --> 01:09:25.182
What?!

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:32.029
I want my drink!

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:46.442
You win.
You win.

01:09:54.122 --> 01:09:55.919
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

01:09:55.957 --> 01:09:58.187
Why is the Bible purple?

01:09:58.226 --> 01:10:00.490
I don't know why it's purple.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:03.987
It was a wedding present.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:06.523
My grandmother brought it
all the way from Hungary.

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:08.195
Someday it'll be yours.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.536
Are there people
where I'm going?

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:22.711
Hey, you're not
going anywhere, kiddo.

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:24.343
You're gonna stay
right here with us.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.411
Daddy...

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.753
everyone dies.

01:10:30.358 --> 01:10:32.690
When they're old.

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.320
When they're much older.

01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:36.626
Okay, and then they go
to a better place.

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:39.657
And it's beautiful there.

01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:42.633
And all your friends
will be there.

01:10:48.443 --> 01:10:50.172
Is God there?

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:52.339
Yes.

01:10:53.982 --> 01:10:55.847
Do you really
believe that, Daddy?

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.182
Yes.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.681
You know what I think!
We should have done more!

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:05.386
- We did everything we could!
- No, we didn't!

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.691
- We should have helped her fight...
- Oh my God.

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:09.959
...instead of filling her head full
of these stories

01:11:09.998 --> 01:11:12.262
about heavens
and the clouds and nirvana

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.131
and all that bullshit!

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.693
Those stories,
she like them.

01:11:15.737 --> 01:11:17.568
I'm going to get
some cigarettes, okay?

01:12:55.303 --> 01:12:58.431
We ponder the situation.

01:12:58.473 --> 01:13:01.806
I'm trying to
accurately describe...

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.706
Orpheus on
the Orpheum Circuit

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:07.738
bathed in tango light,

01:13:07.782 --> 01:13:11.047
the kind of light
that makes the dead...

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.515
get out of their graves
and tango.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.650
Now this is level nine...

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.863
the deepest level of hell,

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:25.663
furthest removed
from all light and warmth.

01:13:27.602 --> 01:13:29.536
This is six.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:32.199
It's goddamn five.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.401
I think I see
the pattern.

01:13:34.442 --> 01:13:37.707
Yes, I can see
the pattern.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.145
Mike.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.343
Mike, can you hear me?

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:45.478
- Michael, where the hell are you?
- Lily.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.317
Michael?

01:13:47.355 --> 01:13:49.380
- Mike.
- Lily.

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:52.188
Michael, can you hear me?

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:53.717
Lily.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:59.898
Oh my God. Thank God.
Jesus, I've been trying to get through!

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.096
- Did you call the cops?
- Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel.

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.162
- Didn't you say the Dolphin?
- Yes.

01:14:04.205 --> 01:14:06.673
- You're sure?
- Yes yes, 1408.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.734
Mike, they're in 1408.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.609
The room's empty.

01:14:11.646 --> 01:14:13.011
Mike?

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.740
Michael,
can you hear me?

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.309
Michael?

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:20.378
Michael,
where the hell are you?

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:23.118
I'm afraid I can't express
myself in this climate.

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.955
Calm down, okay?
We'll figure this out.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.052
- Don't panic.
- I'm supposed to die here.

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.529
Michael, stop it!
You're not gonna die, okay?

01:14:29.564 --> 01:14:31.498
Don't move.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

01:14:34.836 --> 01:14:37.134
Mike?
Michael?

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:40.300
15 minutes
isn't enough time.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:42.742
- It'll be too late.
- No, it won't be too late.

01:14:42.777 --> 01:14:44.244
- Lily.
- Don't...

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.679
Actually, 15 minutes
is perfect.

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.842
It's perfect.
Just come up. Come now.

01:14:48.883 --> 01:14:50.214
- Good, yes.
- I need you.

01:14:50.251 --> 01:14:52.219
You've always been someone
I can count on.

01:14:52.253 --> 01:14:55.279
I know we haven't talked a lot
since... since Katie died,

01:14:55.323 --> 01:14:58.190
- but I need you, sweetie.
- Wait!

01:14:58.226 --> 01:15:00.626
I can't explain it here. You just have
to come here and talk to me.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.788
I miss you too, but...

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.559
When you get here,
don't talk to anybody.

01:15:03.598 --> 01:15:04.997
Just come straight up to the 14th floor.

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.194
- Walk through the door.
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:07.235 --> 01:15:09.362
- It's life or death, sweetie.
- Do not come up to the room!

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.099
- Okay.
- Don't come up to the room!

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.834
- I need to talk to you about Katie.
- Don't! Shut up!

01:15:12.874 --> 01:15:14.933
- Lily, don't listen to him!
- Yes, good.

01:15:14.976 --> 01:15:16.773
- It's a trick! Don't come up here!
- I'll be right there.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.882
Lily! Lily!

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:59.685
My baby! My baby!

01:16:00.922 --> 01:16:03.720
She's heading for the rocks!

01:16:03.758 --> 01:16:06.989
I don't want to die!

01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:25.902
Oh God!

01:16:25.947 --> 01:16:28.040
Man overboard!

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.082
Come on!

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:59.436
Are you okay, buddy?

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.135
Hey, are you breathing?

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.912
Come on, talk to me.

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.346
You guys,
give me a hand here!

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:18.051
Dr. Edwards to Oncology, please.

01:18:23.164 --> 01:18:25.655
Hey.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.793
How are you feeling?

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.495
- Am I out?
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:18:31.539 --> 01:18:32.836
Lie down,
lie down, lie down.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:35.001
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
You're okay.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:36.601
You're in the hospital.

01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:38.805
Hospital where?
In New York?

01:18:38.846 --> 01:18:40.279
New York?
No no, you're in LA.

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:43.284
You got hit on the head
with your board.

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:44.979
I can't believe
you still surf.

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.218
You flew here
just for me?

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:51.248
Yeah. Yeah,
I was worried.

01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:53.487
They called.

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:56.053
I think I'm still listed
as your next of kin.

01:18:56.097 --> 01:18:58.531
Okay, I'm not in New York.

01:18:58.566 --> 01:19:01.034
- I'm out.
- Why do you keep saying that?

01:19:03.671 --> 01:19:05.866
I was in New York.
I was trapped.

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:08.671
In New York,
I was dying

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.042
in this Kafkaesque hotel,

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.240
the Dolphin.

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:16.307
- What?
- The Dolphin Hotel on 45th and Lex.

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.909
- I spoke with you there.
- 45th and Lex?

01:19:17.952 --> 01:19:20.113
- I called you.
- I've never heard of it.

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:26.249
You're gonna be okay.
You just need to rest.

01:19:43.711 --> 01:19:46.976
Oh, we have a winner.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.881
600 bucks.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.891
Unbelievable.

01:20:04.932 --> 01:20:07.093
I can see why
you live here.

01:20:13.641 --> 01:20:16.041
Why did you leave?

01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:25.074
Because every time
I looked at you,

01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:27.087
I saw her face.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.990
I think it's pretty clear.

01:20:40.034 --> 01:20:41.899
I think in the dream
the room's your subconscious

01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:43.767
and it brought up
a lot of stuff.

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.602
That's a good thing
for you.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.665
But this was... I mean, I was down
the rabbit hole.

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:50.109
I was rattled.
I was shook up.

01:20:50.144 --> 01:20:52.009
And I can't shake it.
I think after dinner

01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:53.513
you should drive me
back to the hospital,

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.449
check me into the psych unit.

01:20:58.152 --> 01:21:00.245
You look really great.

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.813
I can't believe
I'm sitting here with you.

01:21:04.325 --> 01:21:05.849
Tell me about it.

01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:08.088
Is everything all right?
Can I get you anything else?

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:11.428
I'll have another
glass of wine, please.

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:14.026
The same.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.794
Mike?

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.466
Yeah, I'll have
another tequila...

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:20.997
Patron, chilled,
double.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.600
Be right back.

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.176
Katie was there.

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.187
Mmm-hm.

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.082
Can you imagine

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:40.492
what it feels like
to have the sensation?

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.553
I mean, the very
real sensation

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.588
that I talked to her,
like, two days ago?

01:21:44.632 --> 01:21:47.396
I talked to her,
saw her, touched her.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.801
Yeah.

01:21:49.837 --> 01:21:52.533
I see her every night
when I shut my eyes.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.969
Yeah, but it was so vivid.

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.104
It was so real.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.047
Maybe you should
write about it.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:03.676
About Katie?
Shit.

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:06.551
- You always were tougher than me.
- Why not?

01:22:06.587 --> 01:22:09.579
Seriously, it sounds like
you're ready to deal with this stuff.

01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:16.295
Can you stay?

01:22:25.706 --> 01:22:28.072
I'm sorry.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.340
Okay, we have got 148.

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.874
148 is gonna be
right about...

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:40.683
Uh-huh.

01:22:40.721 --> 01:22:43.781
So if you'd like
to sign on the line.

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:47.727
Hey!
Hey, man!

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:49.992
You've been
gone a while.

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:52.966
Oh, by the way,
dude, I read your book.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.902
What is it?
"10 Most Haunted Motels," right?

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.838
That's some scary shit.

01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:05.139
See you around.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.680
Did I drop a postcard?

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.209
- What?
- Did I?

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.778
- Huh?
- A postcard.

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:50.416
No, I think I would
have seen it.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.688
But if I find it,
I'll put it in your mailbox.

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.390
Okay?

01:24:26.827 --> 01:24:29.955
My experience in the room
was terrifying,

01:24:29.997 --> 01:24:33.489
a fragmented loop
of unease and despair.

01:24:33.534 --> 01:24:35.627
1408 was a horrible dream,

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:40.266
yet somehow
I awoke from it renewed.

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.708
Mikey! You sound happy.

01:24:42.743 --> 01:24:44.506
- You're scaring me.
- I wouldn't go that far,

01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:47.036
but I must say that the work
is just pouring out of me.

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:49.447
I think I've actually
reinvented myself

01:24:49.483 --> 01:24:52.350
in the form of a kind
of a fictional memoir...

01:24:52.386 --> 01:24:54.115
"Autobiography
of a Nightmare:

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:56.623
Truman Capote meets H.R. Giger."
What do you think?

01:24:56.657 --> 01:24:59.455
I love it!
"In Cold Blood" with "Aliens!"

01:24:59.493 --> 01:25:01.825
That's sexy.
I wanna put it out to auction,

01:25:01.862 --> 01:25:04.353
start a bidding war.
When can I read it?

01:25:04.398 --> 01:25:07.231
Easy, tiger. Any day now.
You're gonna get it as soon as I finish.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:09.463
Okay, Mike.
Less talking, more writing.

01:25:09.503 --> 01:25:11.994
Hey, where's that decaf?
I'm dying here.

01:25:38.599 --> 01:25:40.396
Thank you.

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.539
Hey, Pop.

01:26:03.457 --> 01:26:06.290
How are you doing,
old boy?

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:09.763
Can you hear me?

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:11.992
I don't think so.

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:23.203
I know I haven't been
here in a few months,

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:26.008
but I just wanted to...

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:28.777
come by and see
how you're doing and...

01:26:30.751 --> 01:26:34.380
tell you I was doing okay.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:38.017
Doing pretty good, actually.

01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:42.951
I started talking
to Lily again.

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:46.694
And I wrote a new book,

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:49.567
which I actually think
you would like...

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:54.333
believe it or not.

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:03.378
Michael.

01:27:03.417 --> 01:27:06.580
Dad.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.021
Michael.

01:27:10.057 --> 01:27:13.424
Yeah.

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:16.658
Yeah.

01:27:23.804 --> 01:27:26.238
So...

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:34.444
Hey, you can't park there!
Move it down, will you?

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:37.883
Hey, I got a package
I need to overnight.

01:27:37.918 --> 01:27:41.081
Is this the right form? I got to get
this to New York by tomorrow morning.

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.749
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

01:27:47.828 --> 01:27:49.159
Very well.

01:30:02.963 --> 01:30:05.397
I was out.

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.232
Is that Katie?

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.932
Is that Katie?

01:30:11.972 --> 01:30:14.304
I was out.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.013
I was out!

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.012
I was out.
Please, God.

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:29.750
I know I was out.

01:31:18.038 --> 01:31:20.233
Yeah.

01:31:25.312 --> 01:31:27.177
Open it.

01:31:42.863 --> 01:31:45.696
<i>...are yawning up widely in our path.</i>

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:49.396
<i>We know the way
of the righteous man.</i>

01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.365
Daddy.

01:31:59.079 --> 01:32:02.776
- Daddy?
- No.

01:32:02.816 --> 01:32:05.512
- You're not Katie.
- I need help.

01:32:05.552 --> 01:32:08.282
Please.

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.653
You're not real.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.123
I'm cold.

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:14.059
- You're not Katie.
- So cold.

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.873
I love you, Daddy.

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:38.745
Don't you love me anymore?

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:41.050
Of course I do,
sweetheart.

01:32:42.689 --> 01:32:45.283
There we go.
I got you.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.921
I got you now, Katie.

01:32:48.962 --> 01:32:52.022
- Oh my God.
- They won't let me stay.

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:54.626
- Yes, they will.
- They won't let me stay.

01:32:54.668 --> 01:32:56.533
- What?
- They won't let me stay.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:59.903
No no no no no. Nobody's ever going
to take you away again.

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.774
I got you now, Katie.
Oh my God.

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:05.574
- I'm not gonna let you go.
- Do you love me, Daddy?

01:33:05.612 --> 01:33:08.046
Of course I do. I love you more than
anything in the world.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:10.050
I wish we could
stay together,

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.381
you, me, and Mommy.

01:33:11.418 --> 01:33:14.615
We can, we can.
I got you right here.

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:18.182
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:20.022
Everything is fine.

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.206
No.
No.

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:42.181
No. No.

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:44.150
You can't take her twice.

01:33:46.086 --> 01:33:47.747
You can't.

01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:52.158
Not again.
Please, God.

01:33:52.192 --> 01:33:55.355
You can't.

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:58.622
Please.

01:33:58.665 --> 01:34:00.633
No!

01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:02.498
No.

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:05.528
You bastard.

01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:33.390
You little...

01:34:33.433 --> 01:34:34.957
where is it?

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:37.232
Where?!
Where?!

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.841
Why don't you
just kill me?

01:36:24.878 --> 01:36:26.743
Because all guests of this hotel

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.577
enjoy free will,
Mr. Enslin.

01:36:28.615 --> 01:36:31.311
You can choose to relive this hour
over and over,

01:36:31.351 --> 01:36:34.616
or you can take advantage
of our express checkout system.

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:07.947
Mr. Enslin?

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:53.989
Are you ready to check out,
Mr. Enslin?

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:59.230
No.

01:37:59.272 --> 01:38:01.433
- Not your way.
- I understand.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.578
By the way, Mr. Enslin,
your wife just called.

01:38:09.616 --> 01:38:12.244
She'll be here in five minutes
and we'll send her straight up.

01:38:12.285 --> 01:38:14.617
She's not involved.

01:38:14.654 --> 01:38:17.487
You can't have her.

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:20.322
I'm done arguing with you.

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.893
I'm gonna end this.

01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:26.956
Five.
This is five.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.992
Ignore the siren.
Even if you leave this room,

01:38:30.036 --> 01:38:32.470
you can never
leave this room.

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:36.374
Eight.
This is eight.

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:39.675
We have killed
your friends.

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:42.238
Every friend

01:38:42.282 --> 01:38:44.944
is now dead.

01:38:55.128 --> 01:38:58.620
I lived the life of a selfish man.

01:38:58.665 --> 01:39:02.066
But I don't have
to die that way.

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:05.036
If I'm going down,

01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:08.234
I'm taking you with me.

01:39:11.411 --> 01:39:13.379
This may not all be real,

01:39:13.413 --> 01:39:16.075
and I may not even be real,

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:18.414
but this fire...

01:39:21.321 --> 01:39:23.653
that's got to be real.

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:35.597
Go to hell!

01:39:57.958 --> 01:39:59.425
Get out onto the street!

01:39:59.459 --> 01:40:01.484
Out the doors
and onto the street, please.

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:03.928
Everyone stay calm.

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:10.261
- What's going on?
- I don't know, lady.

01:40:10.303 --> 01:40:13.534
This might take a while.
Something must have happened.

01:40:13.573 --> 01:40:15.939
Thanks.

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:27.016
Keep quiet,
you bastard.

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.653
Please, you've gotta help me.
No, help me.

01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:32.055
- Calm down.
- My husband's inside.

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:34.151
My husband's inside.
You've gotta help him.

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:35.957
You've gotta help him,
please!

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.395
What floor?
What floor?

01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:39.557
14th floor, 1408.
Mike Enslin.

01:40:39.599 --> 01:40:42.033
Please come here.

01:40:42.068 --> 01:40:45.868
You're wasting your time.

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.972
We're here
to do the job,

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:56.141
and we don't rattle.

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:02.316
The decor is in tatters

01:41:02.355 --> 01:41:04.255
and the staff surly.

01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:07.226
But on the Shiver Scale...

01:41:08.628 --> 01:41:11.893
I award the Dolphin
10 skulls!

01:41:35.755 --> 01:41:38.622
Never kill
more than you can eat.

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.628
Daddy, everyone dies.

01:42:21.334 --> 01:42:24.565
We commend to Almighty God
our brother,

01:42:24.604 --> 01:42:27.664
and we commit his body
to the ground,

01:42:27.707 --> 01:42:31.268
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:34.872
dust to dust.

01:42:34.914 --> 01:42:36.575
May you rest in peace.

01:42:36.616 --> 01:42:38.413
Amen.

01:42:38.451 --> 01:42:40.180
Amen.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.688
Well, they're together now.

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.124
Let's go.

01:42:56.569 --> 01:42:58.764
Mrs. Enslin?

01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:05.600
I...

01:43:05.645 --> 01:43:08.011
I am sorry to intrude at such
a delicate time,

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:10.846
but I knew your husband.
I worked at the Dolphin.

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:12.852
Oh.

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.753
While we were cleaning up,
we came across some of his belongings.

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:18.155
No, thank you.

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.182
They are of such
a personal nature, ma'am.

01:43:20.226 --> 01:43:22.353
- I figured maybe you would want to...
- No, please.

01:43:22.395 --> 01:43:24.590
It's not how
I want to remember him.

01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:27.031
I'm sure you understand.

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.728
Oh yes, yes.
Of course I understand.

01:43:28.768 --> 01:43:31.430
But it's important that you know
that he did a great thing.

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:33.666
He did not die
in vain.

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:36.005
What are you talking about?

01:43:36.042 --> 01:43:38.203
Because of him,
the room won't reopen. It's been...

01:43:38.244 --> 01:43:40.337
All right, okay, stop.

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.213
Just give
the lady some air.

01:43:43.249 --> 01:43:45.479
She's been through enough,
don't you think?

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.255
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin

01:44:32.298 --> 01:44:33.595
for effective
aggressiveness.

01:44:33.633 --> 01:44:36.067
I have to admit,
he had me going.

01:44:36.102 --> 01:44:37.535
Get ahold of yourself.

01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:40.232
You're running to places
that aren't real.

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:41.797
Daddy,

01:44:41.841 --> 01:44:43.832
don't you
love me anymore?

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:46.004
Of course I do, sweetheart.

01:44:46.045 --> 01:44:48.605
- Don't you love me, Daddy?
- Of course I do, honey,

01:44:48.648 --> 01:44:50.843
more than anything.
I got you now.

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.512
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:56.920
I got you, Katie.
Nobody's ever gonna take you away again.

01:44:56.956 --> 01:44:58.753
Daddy?

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:01.852
Daddy!
Daddy!

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.954
Daddy!

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:06.329
Daddy!

01:45:14.774 --> 01:45:16.332
Hey, sweetie.

01:46:16.836 --> 01:46:18.997
Daddy!

01:46:19.038 --> 01:46:22.030
Daddy!

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:24.543
Yes, of course.
