00:14.791 --> 00:15.791
Come on!

00:16.291 --> 00:20.458
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.541 --> 00:24.000
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.083 --> 00:24.916
All right!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.125
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:29.375
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.458 --> 00:30.708
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.791 --> 00:32.166
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.250 --> 00:35.500
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.583 --> 00:36.416
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.500 --> 00:37.833
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.916 --> 00:39.916
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:45.291
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.375 --> 00:47.083
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:54.416 --> 00:57.416
<i>The babies are enjoying</i>
<i>their snacks today.</i>

00:57.500 --> 01:02.791
Broccoli's my favourite.
Teeny, tiny trees.

01:04.166 --> 01:08.375
Apple sauce is my favourite. Yum-yum!

01:12.791 --> 01:15.541
Tilly's favourite is peas.

01:16.875 --> 01:20.833
Does Tilly know what my favourite is?

01:25.666 --> 01:26.875
<i>Miàn!</i>

01:26.958 --> 01:30.291
Yes! "Noodles."

01:30.375 --> 01:32.333
Noodles!

01:32.416 --> 01:35.666
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

01:35.750 --> 01:38.750
<i>In the day, in the night</i>
<i>Give me oodles and oodles</i>

01:38.833 --> 01:40.250
<i>-Of noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

01:40.333 --> 01:41.791
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

01:41.875 --> 01:44.875
<i>I got to dance, got to dance</i>
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

01:44.958 --> 01:47.916
<i>I love to dance</i>
<i>Got to dance about the thing I love best</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:50.166
<i>-And that's noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

01:50.250 --> 01:51.458
<i>-Noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

01:51.541 --> 01:54.750
<i>-I move like a noodle</i>
<i>-Watch her wiggle</i>

01:54.833 --> 01:57.916
<i>-Every time I wiggle</i>
<i>-We start to giggle</i>

01:58.000 --> 01:59.583
<i>-My noodle</i>
<i>-Our noodle!</i>

01:59.666 --> 02:01.208
<i>-My noodle</i>
<i>-Her noodle</i>

02:01.291 --> 02:04.375
<i>In a bowl or a cup, I like to slurp 'em up</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:05.458
<i>Noodles</i>

02:05.541 --> 02:07.458
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:07.541 --> 02:10.458
<i>In the day, in the night</i>
<i>Give me oodles and oodles</i>

02:10.541 --> 02:11.916
<i>-Of noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:12.000 --> 02:13.416
<i>-I love noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:13.500 --> 02:16.500
<i>I got to dance, got to dance</i>
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

02:16.583 --> 02:19.666
<i>I love to dance</i>
<i>Got to dance about the thing I love best</i>

02:19.750 --> 02:21.750
<i>-And that's noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:21.833 --> 02:23.333
<i>-Noodles</i>
<i>-Noodles!</i>

02:23.416 --> 02:24.750
<i>Noodles!</i>

02:26.666 --> 02:30.208
-What's your favourite food, Kip?
-That's easy.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.375
My favourite food is

02:32.458 --> 02:34.541
birthday cake!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.208
Birthday cake is yummy,

02:38.291 --> 02:42.416
and you get to sing a song
before you eat it!

02:43.791 --> 02:46.875
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

02:46.958 --> 02:49.875
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

02:49.958 --> 02:53.041
<i>I look like a monkey</i>

02:53.125 --> 02:57.291
<i>But I'm a wallaby</i>

02:59.625 --> 03:02.708
You know, Tilly. Birthday cake?

03:02.791 --> 03:05.833
Yeah, the special cake
you eat on your birthday.

03:05.916 --> 03:06.916
Yeah.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.333
-Tilly wants cake.
-Yeah.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.750
Right now.

03:21.416 --> 03:26.625
Well, Tilly it's not your birthday today,
so we don't have a cake.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.041
Tilly looks really sad.

03:35.625 --> 03:38.291
Well, it's not her birthday,

03:38.375 --> 03:43.166
but maybe we can have
a different special day for Tilly!

03:43.250 --> 03:47.833
Yeah! Like… Happy Tortoise Day!

03:48.500 --> 03:49.875
Good idea.

03:49.958 --> 03:53.416
-And we can make her a special cake!
-Yeah!

03:53.500 --> 03:57.958
Make sure Tilly doesn't find out
or it'll ruin the surprise.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.958
-Yeah. I'm on it.
-Aye, aye, Bail-Bail.

04:02.166 --> 04:06.125
-This is going to be so fun!
-Yeah. I can't wait to make her a cake!

04:08.375 --> 04:10.333
Cookitybot!

04:12.208 --> 04:13.458
There he is!

04:14.458 --> 04:18.250
Cookity, we want
to make a special cake for Tilly.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.000
That's perfect!

04:24.875 --> 04:27.625
What ingredients do we need?

04:28.875 --> 04:30.166
Cake mix.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.041
Butter.

04:32.958 --> 04:34.125
And milk.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.000
Let's start cooking!

04:37.083 --> 04:38.833
Yeah! Let's do it.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.875
-Sorry.
-Excuse me. Pardon me.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.916
Tilly!

04:46.791 --> 04:51.000
So far, so good.
Tilly has no idea about our surprise.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.666
-Oh no!
-Oh no!

04:56.750 --> 05:00.083
-She's heading to the kitchen!
-Yeah. We got to stop her!

05:00.166 --> 05:02.416
-Tilly!
-Uh-oh!

05:03.125 --> 05:06.708
Let's play over here.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.750
Yeah! There are so many toys!

05:12.208 --> 05:14.541
-Want to play with blocks?
-Oh yeah.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.625
Or… wear funny glasses!

05:19.875 --> 05:23.125
Or… honk a horn?

05:23.208 --> 05:26.208
Beep!

05:27.666 --> 05:29.291
Tilly!

05:29.375 --> 05:31.333
Play with… Raffe!

05:45.291 --> 05:47.833
It's my special toy.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.791
Thanks, Lulu.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.041
Okay. That's the cake mix.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.875
-What's next?
-Time for the milk.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.041
What's wrong, Cookitybot?

06:03.791 --> 06:06.250
Maybe the butter goes in next.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.125
-Yeah.
-Here you go, Cookity.

06:10.416 --> 06:13.083
I think Cookity's trying
to tell us something.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.208
I have more milk than the recipe has.

06:25.541 --> 06:29.000
And the butter
in the recipe looks shorter.

06:30.625 --> 06:34.333
I wonder how much butter
and milk we're supposed to put in.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.791
That's a "how much" question.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.541
Maths Molly!

06:45.708 --> 06:47.000
Oh wait!

06:47.666 --> 06:52.666
We have to be quiet, Maths Molly.
We're making a special cake for Tilly.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.000
-It's a surprise.
-Yeah.

07:03.708 --> 07:04.666
Come on.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.416
Oh, hi!

07:07.916 --> 07:11.750
Kip, Maths Molly's going to help us
with Tilly's surprise!

07:11.833 --> 07:13.083
-Wow!
-Yeah.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.708
Let's go. Quietly.

07:19.416 --> 07:22.500
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:22.583 --> 07:25.666
We need help to make Tilly's cake.

07:29.541 --> 07:32.000
That's a block of butter.

07:33.833 --> 07:36.750
And that's how much
Cookity said we needed.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.541
Just that part.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.083
How much is that, big kids?

07:42.250 --> 07:43.875
<i>One half.</i>

07:45.958 --> 07:50.208
So we only need
one half a block of butter.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.833
But what about the milk?

07:55.333 --> 07:59.333
That's a whole jug of milk.
All the way to the top.

08:01.416 --> 08:06.541
But Cookity says we need this much.
Just up to the middle.

08:07.416 --> 08:09.041
How much is that, big kids?

08:09.625 --> 08:11.083
<i>One half.</i>

08:11.916 --> 08:13.958
Well, that's just a half too.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.500
Now I know why Cookity stopped us!

08:17.583 --> 08:20.750
We only need half a block of butter.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.250
And half a jug of milk.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.833
Now you can make Tilly's ca--

08:26.916 --> 08:28.708
Hi, Tilly.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.958
Wow, Tilly. You're just in time
for our… Maths Party!

08:35.041 --> 08:38.041
-Yeah!
-Maths Party!

08:39.083 --> 08:40.500
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:40.583 --> 08:42.000
<i>We did math</i>s

08:42.083 --> 08:44.166
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:45.083 --> 08:48.000
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

08:48.083 --> 08:51.458
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

08:51.541 --> 08:52.375
Yeah!

08:52.458 --> 08:54.083
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:54.166 --> 08:55.500
<i>We did maths</i>

08:55.583 --> 08:57.875
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:58.500 --> 09:01.166
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:01.250 --> 09:06.000
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:06.083 --> 09:08.625
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:09.208 --> 09:11.750
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:15.083 --> 09:16.958
One half jug of milk.

09:21.125 --> 09:24.375
And one half a block of butter!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.000
Scoopy-doop.

09:35.791 --> 09:37.708
He's mixing!

09:40.291 --> 09:41.916
He's cooking!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.833
Wow!

09:53.958 --> 09:54.958
Tilly.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.416
It's not your birthday,

09:57.500 --> 10:01.000
but we still wanted you
to have a special day.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.666
So…

10:03.791 --> 10:06.458
Happy Tortoise Day!

10:20.833 --> 10:23.541
That cake was so yummy!

10:25.000 --> 10:26.791
Did you like it, Tilly?

10:27.916 --> 10:28.750
Look!

10:28.833 --> 10:31.208
We ate half the cake.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.416
We sure did.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.875
One half of the whole.

10:37.416 --> 10:40.458
I'm really full now.

10:41.750 --> 10:42.833
Me too.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.291
Tilly, what do you want to do next?

10:55.416 --> 10:59.875
I think Tilly wants
to do her pattern dance.

10:59.958 --> 11:05.041
It's Happy Tortoise Day,
so the tortoise gets to choose!

11:05.583 --> 11:07.083
Yay!

11:08.208 --> 11:10.333
<i>Let's do Tilly's pattern dance</i>

11:10.416 --> 11:12.708
<i>-It's such a fun dance to do</i>
-Yeah!

11:12.791 --> 11:14.708
<i>We'll follow Tilly's pattern</i>

11:14.791 --> 11:16.875
<i>You can do it too</i>

11:16.958 --> 11:18.541
And it goes like this!

11:19.041 --> 11:21.208
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:21.291 --> 11:23.666
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:23.750 --> 11:25.708
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:25.791 --> 11:28.166
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:28.250 --> 11:30.541
<i>Can we change it a little?</i>
<i>Put a hop in the middle?</i>

11:30.625 --> 11:32.541
<i>Spin around and pretend to climb?</i>

11:32.625 --> 11:35.250
<i>But that's not Tilly's pattern</i>

11:35.333 --> 11:39.291
<i>A pattern does the same thing every time</i>

11:39.958 --> 11:41.458
Here we go!

11:41.541 --> 11:43.875
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:43.958 --> 11:46.333
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:46.416 --> 11:48.583
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:48.666 --> 11:51.416
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:51.500 --> 11:53.458
<i>That's Tilly's pattern</i>

12:00.625 --> 12:03.541
<i>The babies are playing outside today.</i>

12:04.083 --> 12:07.291
<i>Franny is painting a picture</i>
<i>of her friends.</i>

12:08.041 --> 12:09.166
Hold still.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.750
So I can paint you.

12:12.833 --> 12:17.875
Why did I think this was a good pose?
My leg is asleep.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.166
No moving.

12:19.916 --> 12:23.250
Franny, how much longer?

12:23.333 --> 12:29.125
Well, I can't finish until I find
the perfect colour for the last part.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.666
Let's see. Not red. Not purple.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.500
Hurry, please.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.750
I don't think my arm likes this any more.

12:37.833 --> 12:38.708
<i>Shì.</i>

12:39.875 --> 12:43.541
Maybe the big kids
can help you choose a colour?

12:45.125 --> 12:46.208
Great idea!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.666
I really need your help.

12:51.125 --> 12:54.166
<i>What's your favourite colour?</i>
<i>I'm asking you</i>

12:54.250 --> 12:57.833
<i>Clap two times</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's blue</i>

12:58.750 --> 12:59.875
<i>Blue!</i>

12:59.958 --> 13:03.000
<i>What's the nicest colour you've ever seen?</i>

13:03.083 --> 13:06.708
<i>Clap and dance</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's green</i>

13:07.708 --> 13:08.583
<i>Green!</i>

13:08.666 --> 13:12.166
<i>Is your favourite colour orange?</i>
<i>I'm asking you</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:15.666
<i>Clap and dance if you love orange too</i>

13:16.708 --> 13:17.666
<i>Orange!</i>

13:17.750 --> 13:21.041
<i>The colours of the rainbow</i>

13:21.125 --> 13:27.166
<i>-Are all so beautiful to me</i>
<i>-The colours of the rainbow</i>

13:27.250 --> 13:31.625
<i>Are so beautiful to see</i>

13:31.708 --> 13:32.833
<i>Colours!</i>

13:32.916 --> 13:34.291
<i>Colours!</i>

13:34.375 --> 13:35.750
<i>Colours!</i>

13:36.333 --> 13:37.333
<i>Colours!</i>

13:39.000 --> 13:43.875
-I choose… pink.
-Hurry.

13:43.958 --> 13:44.791
Done!

13:46.791 --> 13:49.583
-Come look!
<i>-</i>Okay.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.541
-Wow!
-I'm cute.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.541
And I'm silly!

13:57.625 --> 14:02.416
-What a good painting, Franny.
<i>-</i>You like it? You really like it?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.958
-I love it.
-Yeah!

14:04.041 --> 14:05.041
But…

14:05.125 --> 14:06.541
There's a mistake.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.000
-A mistake?
-Mm-hm.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.708
You're too tall in the painting, Franny.

14:12.791 --> 14:17.291
But I'm the oldest,
so that makes me the tallest.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.500
But I'm taller than you.

14:22.708 --> 14:24.333
No.

14:24.416 --> 14:30.125
The oldest is always the tallest.
It's a rule.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.000
Is that a rule?

14:32.583 --> 14:34.083
I don't think so.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.791
Well, maybe we could measure ourselves
to see who's the tallest.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.166
Okay, but how do we do that?

14:42.083 --> 14:43.791
The What's It Toy.

14:43.875 --> 14:47.125
He always has
what you need when you need it.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.041
Yeah!

14:48.125 --> 14:50.375
Follow the What's It!

14:57.333 --> 14:58.750
A pencil.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.458
Thanks, What's It!

15:03.250 --> 15:06.625
But how does a pencil help us measure?

15:06.708 --> 15:09.791
<i>Babies, you can use the pencil</i>
<i>to measure your height</i>

15:09.875 --> 15:12.791
<i>against the bathroom door,</i>
<i>like we've done before.</i>

15:12.875 --> 15:15.583
Oh yeah! I remember that.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.875
See? Here are our old measurements.

15:18.958 --> 15:23.666
-Look how little we used to be.
-Let's see how big we are now.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.583
<i>Dà.</i>

15:24.666 --> 15:26.458
That's right, Tilly. "Big."

15:27.291 --> 15:29.250
-Tilly can go first.
-Yeah.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.916
-Yeah!
-Come on, Tilly.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.208
Just stand against the wall,

15:34.291 --> 15:37.500
and I'll draw a line
where the top of your head is.

15:37.583 --> 15:41.708
And your sticker
goes right here to mark your height.

15:41.791 --> 15:44.291
That's how tall you are now, Tilly.

15:44.375 --> 15:48.125
-Me next! How tall am I?
-Okay. Come on, Lulu.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.958
Right here.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.250
And your sticker.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.791
I'm getting big!

15:56.875 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.250
My turn?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.291
-Yeah. I'll do it.
-Okay.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.583
Let's see if I've grown.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.291
Hold still.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.416
Yeah!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.000
And there's my sticker.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.083
I've grown!

16:14.041 --> 16:16.000
-Who's next?
-My turn.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.083
Okay, Kip.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.291
Kippie is super tall.

16:28.375 --> 16:30.000
I sure am.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.500
Okay. Your turn, Franny.

16:34.458 --> 16:39.291
Okay! I'm just gonna…
'Cause it's my turn, I'm just gonna…

16:39.375 --> 16:42.000
Wait a second.
I just want to see where Kip--

16:42.083 --> 16:44.166
Don't move, please, Franny.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.791
You're on your tippy-toes.

16:51.666 --> 16:54.416
-No tippy-toes.
-Okay, fine.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.583
But…

16:56.583 --> 16:59.666
Is that a giant walking bowl of noodles?

17:00.458 --> 17:02.791
Where? Noodles? Where?!

17:02.875 --> 17:05.666
-I don't see anything.
-I don't see any noodles.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.583
I thought I saw something,
but it was nothing.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.666
Okay, you can measure now.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.166
Wow!

17:12.250 --> 17:15.000
Wow, Franny! You're really tall!

17:15.083 --> 17:20.250
Yeah, well, I ate a lot of broccoli today,
so I guess I grew a lot.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.125
Franny, you're not supposed
to stand on a stool.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.083
I knew you weren't that tall.

17:33.166 --> 17:36.000
But I don't think we're measuring right.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.416
Because I should be the tallest!

17:38.500 --> 17:41.708
No. I am the tallest.

17:41.791 --> 17:44.000
I don't think so.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.083
I do think so.

17:48.875 --> 17:52.166
I think our measuring might be maths.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.458
Maths Molly!

17:56.666 --> 17:59.541
Yay! Come on, there she goes!

18:00.583 --> 18:02.000
Come quick, Tilly!

18:02.666 --> 18:06.083
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

18:06.166 --> 18:07.458
We need your help.

18:07.541 --> 18:11.000
To prove that I'm the tallest.

18:15.208 --> 18:19.875
That's us, but I can't tell
who's the tallest when we're like that.

18:19.958 --> 18:25.458
<i>Babies, when you measure,</i>
<i>everyone has to stand in the same spot.</i>

18:30.750 --> 18:32.791
Yes! Like that!

18:32.875 --> 18:35.166
Be in the same place.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.958
Now we can measure.

18:44.833 --> 18:50.375
Big kids, now that we're measuring
the right way, who's the tallest baby?

18:52.250 --> 18:53.208
<i>Kip.</i>

18:54.458 --> 18:57.666
Yeah! I'm the tallest baby!

18:58.750 --> 19:00.583
Tallest! Yeah!

19:00.666 --> 19:06.750
You are, Kip. I thought I was,
but I wasn't measuring the right way.

19:06.833 --> 19:11.166
Well, that's okay, Franny.
At least we learned how to measure.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.500
And now we can have a…

19:13.583 --> 19:17.000
Maths Party!

19:17.583 --> 19:22.458
You can have a Maths Party
if you want to. I don't feel like it.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.250
But we didn't even sing yet.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.583
-Franny, wait!
-Franny!

19:31.458 --> 19:33.083
Are you okay, Franny?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.416
We want to know how you're feeling.

19:41.916 --> 19:44.500
You should use your words.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.291
<i>There's a word for this</i>
<i>There's a word for that</i>

19:49.375 --> 19:51.916
<i>Use your words to say where you're at</i>

19:52.000 --> 19:53.458
<i>-Happy?</i>
<i>-Sad?</i>

19:53.541 --> 19:54.875
<i>Feeling not so good?</i>

19:54.958 --> 19:57.750
<i>Use your words to be understood</i>

19:58.333 --> 20:00.958
<i>-Do you have a frown?</i>
<i>-Feel icky and bad?</i>

20:01.041 --> 20:02.375
<i>What's the word to use?</i>

20:02.458 --> 20:04.125
<i>The word is "mad"</i>

20:04.208 --> 20:06.916
<i>-You feel like pouting?</i>
<i>-You want to scream?</i>

20:07.000 --> 20:10.416
<i>Use your words to say what you mean</i>

20:11.500 --> 20:14.416
<i>There's a word for this</i>
<i>There's a word for that</i>

20:14.500 --> 20:17.458
<i>Use your words to say where you're at</i>

20:17.541 --> 20:20.625
<i>Happy? Sad? Feeling not so good?</i>

20:20.708 --> 20:22.125
<i>Use your words</i>

20:22.208 --> 20:23.583
<i>Use your words</i>

20:23.666 --> 20:29.416
<i>Use your words to be understood</i>

20:31.625 --> 20:33.625
I'm ready to use my words.

20:33.708 --> 20:39.375
I'm sad because I thought,
since I was the oldest,

20:39.458 --> 20:41.958
that would make me the tallest.

20:43.250 --> 20:48.708
And if I'm not the tallest, what am I?

20:49.750 --> 20:55.083
Well, you're still the oldest.
And you're a really great painter.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.666
Yeah, and a really good chef.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.041
And you're the fastest, by a lot.

21:02.958 --> 21:06.416
-Well, I do have cheetah speed.
-Yeah.

21:06.500 --> 21:11.000
And you're also a really great friend.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.083
The best.

21:12.666 --> 21:13.583
<i>Shì.</i>

21:15.083 --> 21:18.375
So, it's okay that I'm not the tallest?

21:18.458 --> 21:22.166
Well, yes. You're Franny size.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.583
And that's a perfect size for a Franny.

21:26.166 --> 21:27.041
<i>Shì.</i>

21:28.333 --> 21:32.041
I guess it is.
Thanks for helping me feel better.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.791
And, Kip?

21:35.666 --> 21:38.666
Congratulations on being the tallest.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.375
Thanks, Franny.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.041
-I love you, Franny.
-Me too.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.708
What's Maths Molly doing?

21:53.458 --> 21:56.208
Well, we never had our Maths Party.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.208
Well, we learned how to measure,
and that was tricky.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.125
So we should have a…

22:04.166 --> 22:07.333
Maths Party!

22:08.875 --> 22:10.291
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

22:10.375 --> 22:11.791
<i>We did math</i>s

22:11.875 --> 22:13.958
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

22:14.875 --> 22:17.791
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

22:17.875 --> 22:21.250
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

22:21.333 --> 22:22.166
Yeah!

22:22.250 --> 22:23.875
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

22:23.958 --> 22:25.291
<i>We did maths</i>

22:25.375 --> 22:27.791
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

22:28.291 --> 22:30.958
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

22:31.041 --> 22:35.791
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

22:35.875 --> 22:38.416
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

22:39.000 --> 22:41.708
<i>We love maths!</i>

22:43.375 --> 22:47.666
Bye, big kids. Thanks
for helping us learn to measure today.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.958
And for making me feel better.

22:50.041 --> 22:52.791
Oh no, Balloony!

22:52.875 --> 22:54.041
Don't worry, Lulu.

22:54.125 --> 22:58.000
I'll get it with my cheetah speed!

22:58.083 --> 23:00.333
-Go, Franny!
-Go, Franny, go!
