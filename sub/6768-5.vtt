WEBVTT

00:01.751 --> 00:03.920
(tires squealing)

00:04.003 --> 00:06.339
(shots firing)

00:07.298 --> 00:08.758
(yelping)

00:08.842 --> 00:11.302
(resounding gunshot)

00:11.386 --> 00:12.804
{\an1}Brandon.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.889
{\an1}You okay?

00:14.973 --> 00:16.516
{\an3}Yeah.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.935
You're having that dream again,
weren't you?

00:19.018 --> 00:20.270
Yeah.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.522
Brandon, you got
to give yourself a break.

00:22.605 --> 00:23.732
It wasn't your fault.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.735
{\an3}Well, you know that,
and I know that.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.528
(sighs)

00:28.611 --> 00:32.448
But my subconscious is having a
little harder time accepting it.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.743
There's nothing
you could have done.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.120
One of those bullets
probably had your name on it.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.789
I wish those guys would
have had better aim.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.625
Don't say things like that.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.920
{\an1}Get this through
your thick male ego.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
You are not the bad guy.
They are.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.677
Thank God I'm in love
with a woman

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
with a degree in psychology.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.639
Child psychology.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.018
Even better.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.980
(sighing)

01:04.063 --> 01:06.733
Lineup's the day
after tomorrow.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.818
We could postpone,
if you're not ready.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.529
No. I want to get it over with.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.530
You sure?

01:12.614 --> 01:13.698
{\an1}Yeah.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.493
If I don't,
it's going to kill me.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.287
It'll kill us.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.540
It'll be okay, baby.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.834
It's going to be okay.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.965
{\an3}Mr. Parish, thanks
for seeing me again.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.550
{\an3}I apologize for
not calling first.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.385
{\an1}It's always a pleasure
seeing you, Donna.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.596
Your new designs
are sensational.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.348
{\an5}You'll be hearing
from us real soon.
Great.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.683
{\an5}You know the way out,
don't you?
Yes, I do.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.851
Thanks again.
Thank you.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.311
{\an3}Bye.
Bye.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.668
(indistinct conversations)

02:06.751 --> 02:08.044
(steam hisses)

02:17.971 --> 02:20.056
{\an3}Hi. Hey. I thought
we could talk again.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.850
I know you were in a
hurry the other day.

02:21.933 --> 02:22.934
I have to work now.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.228
{\an3}No. Listen. Nothing is
going to change around here

02:25.311 --> 02:27.230
{\an3}until someone talks about the
abuses, about the problems.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.941
No, no. No problems.
Everything is good.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.734
I have to work now.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.403
<i>Eluvia, vamonos.</i>
<i>¿Estas loca?</i>

02:33.486 --> 02:35.905
{\an4}<i>Vamonos.</i>
I know you probably
can't talk here.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.783
So, maybe you could give me
a call or you could come by.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.910
{\an5}ELUVIA:
<i>Señorita, necessito</i>
<i>pasar, por favor.</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:42.537
<i>Tengo que trabajar.</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:44.914
I don't speak
Spanish. Here.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.666
(whispers indistinctly)

02:48.960 --> 02:50.128
{\an1}PARISH:
Lost?

02:51.504 --> 02:52.881
Yes.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.382
{\an3}I am.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.082
I have got two words for you.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.875
Magic Mountain.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.918
{\an1}They've got
a roller coaster there

04:54.002 --> 04:55.378
that goes up like ten stories.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.046
{\an1}And then it drops you
straight back down.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.715
But you hang weightless
for, like, six seconds.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.091
{\an1}It's the coolest thing.
What do you say?

05:00.174 --> 05:03.052
I have two words
for you-- no way.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.054
{\an1}Oh, come on.
Zach will love it.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.389
Zach will miss school.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.057
{\an1}Miss school?
The kid's in first grade.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.434
{\an1}What's he going to miss,
Advanced Spitwad?

05:09.517 --> 05:10.601
I could teach him that.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.769
I have no doubt.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.938
Well, isn't there a
height requirement

05:14.022 --> 05:14.814
or something, anyway?

05:14.897 --> 05:17.483
I'm going to put lifts
in his shoes.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.278
And I thought you weren't
a good influence.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.529
That's a yes, isn't it?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.197
That's an "I'll think about it."

05:23.281 --> 05:24.782
How are you going
to take time off work?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.200
I'm the publisher.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.869
I'll just give myself a day off.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.704
Ah.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.250
Why don't you guys grab a booth?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.918
Hey, what's up, guys?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.045
{\an3}Hi.
Hey, bud.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.254
{\an1}Uh, could you
take special care

05:38.337 --> 05:39.630
{\an1}of my friends
over there, please?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.299
I live to serve.
Thank you.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.759
If it isn't Das Band.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.887
{\an3}From what Donna tells me,
those guys should be wearing

05:45.970 --> 05:48.639
jack boots and brown shirts.
(sighs)

05:48.723 --> 05:51.601
DAVID: I can't believe Donna's
telling people they're bigots.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.228
She said she heard one of them
saying something anti-Semitic.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.230
Steve, I've been
working with them

05:56.314 --> 05:57.398
{\an1}for a week straight,
all right?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.233
{\an1}We just pulled an all-nighter
working on their demo tape.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.777
If they were jerks,
I'd know about it.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.654
{\an3}Like I said, they look
like righteous dudes to me.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.073
{\an3}See you.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.785
{\an3}Hey, uh, you wouldn't
happen to have

06:08.868 --> 06:10.078
an extra 50 on
you, would you?

06:10.161 --> 06:11.537
{\an3}I left my
wallet at home.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.956
What do I look like, an ATM?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.541
I'm as tapped as you are.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962
BRANDON:
<i>What'd ya come up with?</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:21.672
{\an3}Nothing.
Her name's Eluvia.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.757
Not much to go on.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.633
Good news is, I did get

06:23.716 --> 06:25.927
a line on the owner
of the building.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.095
Hmm.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.805
Sandtrap Properties.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.848
What about the owner
of Soho Mix &amp; Match?

06:30.932 --> 06:32.308
Nothing there.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.810
Paper trail of holding
companies.

06:33.893 --> 06:34.894
I did get a listing

06:34.977 --> 06:37.480
of the fire code and sanitation
violations, though.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.774
The place is a real tenement.
If you could give me a hand,

06:39.857 --> 06:42.151
we may be able to get a line
on the real owner.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.946
Yeah, I'll just have Valerie
cover my afternoon appointment.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.327
Ooh.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.329
(phone ringing)

06:53.412 --> 06:54.497
Mmm, hello.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.498
COOPER:
Hungry?

06:55.581 --> 06:56.499
Cooper?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.042
You recognized my voice.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.335
That's a good sign.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.795
Well, it's good business,

07:00.878 --> 07:02.338
makes the customer feel
important.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.923
Oh, so that's all I am now?

07:04.006 --> 07:05.133
A customer?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.844
Well, then if you want to make
me feel really important,

07:07.927 --> 07:09.387
have breakfast with me.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.013
You know, I'm a very busy woman.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.849
I can't just drop everything
and run off.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.766
Sure, you can.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.811
I could pick you up there
in a heartbeat.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.271
Look, it's really tempting,
but...

07:18.354 --> 07:21.524
Yeah, I know, you got
someone coming over.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.984
No, I don't.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.986
(doorbell ringing)

07:25.069 --> 07:26.112
What are you, psychic?

07:30.074 --> 07:30.741
(ringing continues)

07:30.825 --> 07:32.827
(knocking)

07:32.910 --> 07:33.995
Hi.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.496
Uh, hi.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.707
Young, dark, handsome?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.041
He's not your boyfriend, is he?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.127
No, he's, um...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.507
Come on in.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.050
Oh, sure, I'd love
to see your place.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.552
No, stay right there.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.179
Trouble making
your mind up, huh?

07:51.262 --> 07:52.471
No.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.056
Come in.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.057
Hope you don't mind,

07:55.141 --> 07:57.018
{\an3}Brandon said I could use
the washer and dryer.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.352
Oh, okay, um,

07:58.436 --> 08:01.397
{\an1}it's in the kitchen,
first door on the right.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.940
Uh, what's the limo doing
out front?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.901
Oh, it's just a client of mine.

08:05.693 --> 08:06.694
Nice job,

08:06.777 --> 08:09.322
getting chauffeured around town
all day in a limo.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.241
{\an3}Look, I know we've been
avoiding each other,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.243
but while the machine's
eating my laundry

08:14.327 --> 08:16.078
how about breakfast?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.955
Breakfast? Uh, I can't.

08:18.039 --> 08:18.915
Why not?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.249
Oh, no, not you.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.125
Who?

08:21.209 --> 08:22.752
You know, this is really
not a good time.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.753
I can wait.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.546
Uh, deal with Mr. Duffel Bag.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.797
I gotta make a call to London.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.925
Okay, I-I'll call you back.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.138
So what's the, uh, sudden urge
to do laundry?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.557
Well, it's kind of hard to do it
out at sea.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.477
I took the offer.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.479
To skipper that 72-footer
back to Hawaii.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.898
Oh, I thought you were
just thinking about it.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.692
(phone ringing)

08:46.776 --> 08:48.110
So when?

08:48.194 --> 08:50.571
Couple of days.
I got nothing to hold me back.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.241
Yeah?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.450
London's busy.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.826
I'm still free for breakfast.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.870
Okay, I'll be right there.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.623
Listen, I gotta go.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.959
{\an1}Um, if I don't this client's
gonna be history.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.128
{\an1}So... but we really
need to talk.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.296
<i>Slow Dance.</i>

09:08.256 --> 09:09.632
That's the name of the boat.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.926
Slip 33.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.011
{\an3}VALERIE:
Okay, I'll find you.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.846
{\an3}Not after 6:00,
you won't.

09:15.930 --> 09:16.973
We'll be fueling up.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.444
(door opens, shuts)

09:30.528 --> 09:31.988
Hey, stranger.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.489
Kelly.

09:33.572 --> 09:34.991
Why are you dressed like that?

09:35.074 --> 09:36.534
How should I be dressed?

09:36.617 --> 09:37.785
For a day on a boat.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.162
Sailing?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.290
I'll be right back.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.253
(pager beeping)

09:48.921 --> 09:50.923
Sorry, it's business.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.844
Hey, what's up?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.846
Well, I'm still on this
sweatshop thing.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.015
Can you cover for me
with Mrs. Van Dyke?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
Donna, I'm not the personal
schlepper-- you are.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.685
Look, I already picked out
everything.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.812
All you have to do is pick up
the clothes at my place,

10:04.895 --> 10:07.857
take them to her, she'll try 'em
on-- like some, hate most.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.067
It's a whole performance type of
thing. Just take good notes

10:10.151 --> 10:11.902
and we'll go over them later,
is that okay?

10:11.986 --> 10:12.987
Okay.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.030
I'll give it a try.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.115
Great. You're a life saver, Val.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.035
Oh, well.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.203
We can still have
a quick breakfast.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.205
{\an3}Just not where
I'd planned.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.415
Where was that?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.542
San Francisco.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.885
Yeah, tell Brandon that
I got his messages.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.054
Yes, Terri, all four.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.014
Yeah, I'm at the marina
with Noah.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.390
He has the number.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.892
Okay, bye.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.435
Four calls.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.895
{\an1}It's cute.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.440
{\an4}The knot's called
a bowline.
Hmm?

10:49.523 --> 10:50.733
It's this end, yeah.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.735
Rabbit up through the hole.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.195
Wow.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.406
Yeah, he's been, uh,
keeping pretty close tabs.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.575
Well, I would, too.

10:59.658 --> 11:02.203
I just wish he wouldn't
worry so much, you know?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.080
{\an1}He'll lighten up
when the case is over

11:04.163 --> 11:06.123
{\an1}and these guys who
shot you are put away.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.750
{\an3}Yeah.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.877
You still worried about the
police lineup tomorrow, huh?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.088
I told Detective Woods
that I don't remember

11:12.171 --> 11:13.923
anything about the shooting,

11:14.006 --> 11:16.425
{\an3}but he said that maybe
if I see the guy

11:16.509 --> 11:18.552
it'll help jog my memory.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.096
Want me to go with you guys?

11:20.179 --> 11:21.263
{\an3}Oh, no.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.932
{\an3}You've already done
so much for us.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.266
I haven't done anything.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.103
My point exactly.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.939
{\an3}When I lost my memory
about Brandon,

11:30.022 --> 11:31.273
{\an3}you could've
taken advantage.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.483
But you didn't.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.068
{\an1}It's my proudest
achievement.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.029
Believe me.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.953
{\an1}(indistinct
conversation)

11:44.036 --> 11:45.955
BRANDON: Well, looks like
there's pretty good money

11:46.038 --> 11:47.123
in the slumlord business.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.958
We don't know that yet.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.001
Won't you have a seat?
I'll be right with you.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.962
{\an3}Thanks.
Thanks.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.971
Don...

12:06.725 --> 12:08.436
Rush Sanders?

12:08.519 --> 12:10.980
How do we tell Steve that
his Dad owns a sweatshop?

12:11.063 --> 12:13.065
I have no idea.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.327
VAN DYKE:
<i>For what I'm paying her,</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:27.163
I think Ms. Martin
might've worked out

12:27.246 --> 12:29.039
{\an1}her schedule
to accommodate me.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.042
Though I have to say,
she does have an eye.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.502
Well, she means well,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.671
but she's never run a
business like I have.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.298
{\an1}Defending your partner,
very admirable.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.508
Oh, I'm not defending her.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.511
Uh, why don't you try this one?

12:42.595 --> 12:43.429
You know, I think
it's all right to

12:43.512 --> 12:45.598
{\an3}go off on flights of
fancy sometimes but...

12:45.681 --> 12:48.517
A businesswoman can not
afford to be frivolous.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.354
Mrs. Van Dyke, I wouldn't
say this just to anybody

12:52.438 --> 12:55.316
{\an3}but Donna's gotten
herself involved

12:55.399 --> 12:59.653
{\an3}with... of all things,
a sweatshop.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.779
Sweatshop?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.199
I will not wear clothes

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
that came from a sweatshop.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.663
My God, I've got a closet full
of furs I can't even be seen in.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.207
No, I picked these out
at the finest...

13:11.290 --> 13:13.000
You picked them out?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.712
You should never
let someone else

13:16.795 --> 13:18.547
take credit for your talent.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.883
You may be a modern woman,

13:20.966 --> 13:23.219
but you have to learn
not to be so bashful.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.386
Unzip me.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.597
Well, I guess I just

13:26.680 --> 13:28.390
{\an3}grew up with a strong
sense of loyalty.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.851
{\an1}Being loyal is one
thing, Valerie.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.062
Being used is another.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.525
{\an5}STEVE:
<i>Well, okay, thanks for</i>
<i>calling</i> The Beverly Beat.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.400
Hello.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.401
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.528
So, we found out

13:40.611 --> 13:44.031
the height requirement
for the rides is 48 inches.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.574
And I'm 49.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.535
Yes!
Yes!

13:47.618 --> 13:49.745
{\an3}Which means you won't have to
commit a felony, after all.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.747
What's a felony?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.582
A felony is when you take

13:53.666 --> 13:55.417
a six-year-old kid
to an amusement park

13:55.501 --> 13:57.920
and don't take him
on all the rides.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.422
You wouldn't commit
a felony, would you, Mommy?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.592
Uh, you see that really
neat desk over there?

14:04.843 --> 14:06.095
Wanna go mess it up?

14:06.178 --> 14:07.388
{\an3}TERRI:
Better yet,

14:07.471 --> 14:09.265
how about I help you
make a headline?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.225
{\an1}Cool.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.061
Oh, we're gonna have a blast!

14:14.144 --> 14:15.437
{\an4}We'll get on that
roller coaster...
Steve...

14:15.521 --> 14:16.939
{\an1}We'll just go straight up
in the air and when we

14:17.022 --> 14:18.107
come down, all the blood...
Steve...

14:18.190 --> 14:19.316
Thanks.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.609
{\an3}I can't remember
the last time

14:20.693 --> 14:22.069
I saw him so excited.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.279
Cool.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.405
{\an1}Hey, guys.
Hey.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.447
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.283
Uh, we gotta
talk to you.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.577
{\an3}You know, I was just
on my way out.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.121
Come on, Zach.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.747
{\an3}Terri's putting me
in the headline.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.457
"Zach Rules!"

14:35.541 --> 14:37.459
{\an1}Oh, we'll have to read
all about it later.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.795
{\an1}STEVE: I'll pick you up at The
Peach Pit tomorrow at 10:00.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.297
Don't be late, Z-man.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.965
Don't worry, he'll be
ready at 8:00.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.509
Let me guess.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.594
Late-breaking news?

14:46.677 --> 14:48.470
{\an1}Steve, um, you
ever hear of

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
Sandtrap Properties?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.848
{\an3}Yeah.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.433
That's one of my
father's companies.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.643
Then I guess the best thing
is to just tell you.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.520
Tell me what?

14:56.604 --> 14:59.148
Sandtrap owns the
sweatshop building.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.233
Donna, my father owns
properties all over town.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.527
Just because
he owns the building

15:03.611 --> 15:04.820
doesn't mean he has
anything to do with

15:04.903 --> 15:06.196
what the tenants
are doing in it.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.532
Maybe, but it doesn't
look maintained at all.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.410
My father doesn't run
a sweatshop, Donna.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.288
Steve, we're not accusing,

15:14.371 --> 15:16.874
but it does make sense
that the landlord would know

15:16.957 --> 15:18.959
about the fire and
sanitation violations.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.169
He's been cited.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.462
You are accusing.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.298
We still have some
checking to do.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.717
No, we don't have
any checking to do.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.510
I will do the checking.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.346
I'm sure it's gonna be nothing.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.434
(door closes)

15:36.894 --> 15:38.020
Here, dude...

15:38.103 --> 15:41.732
(rock music playing)

15:41.815 --> 15:44.693
♪ Just let it go ♪

15:46.111 --> 15:47.863
♪ Let it go ♪

15:47.946 --> 15:50.991
Bring it up a little bit.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.292
(music fading)

16:00.376 --> 16:02.419
Guys, tha-that was it,
that was perfect!

16:02.503 --> 16:03.504
That was killer.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.755
DEVIN: Do you want to hear
something really killer?

16:04.838 --> 16:07.549
We got this new song we've been
working on called "Prophesy."

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
{\an3}It's a little raw, but that's
kind of the way we like it.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.220
Are you ready?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.055
{\an5}One, two...
DAVID:
Uh, guys,

16:13.138 --> 16:15.599
I really want to hear the song,
but, uh, what do you say

16:15.683 --> 16:17.476
we finish up
the stuff we already know works?

16:17.559 --> 16:18.727
{\an3}All right.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.481
You know what, uh, take five.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.525
Okay.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.611
Five's just about
all you got left.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.700
All we need is another hour
and we'll be outta here.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.243
No problem.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
Lucky there's no one
booked in behind you.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.246
Wonderful.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.914
But I need to collect up front.

16:38.997 --> 16:39.915
Up front?

16:40.874 --> 16:42.126
You know I'm good for it.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.419
You've heard these guys.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.294
We're on the Yellow
Brick Road here.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.505
Yeah, I know,
but it's a crowded road.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.508
Look, I don't make the rules.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.843
(sighs)

16:53.679 --> 16:54.930
Here.

16:55.013 --> 16:58.267
{\an1}This the one that
kicked back on me before?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.602
Um, yeah, it might be.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.231
{\an3}You know, as soon as, uh,
we're done, I'll bring

17:04.314 --> 17:05.441
another one back.
Sorry, man.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.983
My hands are tied.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.819
(sighing)

17:08.902 --> 17:10.404
What's up, boss?

17:10.487 --> 17:14.116
{\an3}Uh, nothing, um, the
studio's all booked up,

17:14.199 --> 17:15.409
we're out of time.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.201
We'll be back tomorrow.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.912
3:00's yours if
you want it, man.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.998
But you gotta handle it
before you start.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.540
{\an3}Thanks.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.960
{\an3}Handle what?
Just some,

17:25.042 --> 17:26.336
uh, release forms.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.588
{\an3}Is 3:00

17:27.671 --> 17:29.423
{\an1}cool for you?
Yeah, but I gotta

17:29.506 --> 17:31.842
be somewhere at 6:00, so, uh,
just make sure you tell

17:31.925 --> 17:35.053
the homeboy that we're not
working on African time.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.477
RUSH:
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:44.188
I didn't even know there was
a garment factory in there.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.315
{\an1}Ernie manages all my
downtown properties for me.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.484
Well, good, 'cause you know,
we got this lead

17:48.567 --> 17:49.818
and we gotta check up on it.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.361
Of course you do.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.530
I don't like people being
exploited any more than you do.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.907
I'll check into it myself.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.366
If any of my tenants are
violating the labor code,

17:56.450 --> 17:57.951
not paying overtime,

17:58.035 --> 17:59.787
whatever, I'll, uh, I'll
make them shape up.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.163
Good.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.456
Thanks.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.167
Uh, you know,

18:05.250 --> 18:06.835
{\an3}allegedly, there's some
building code violations.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.837
{\an1}Yeah, well, it's all
those downtown buildings.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.131
We're continually
fixing things up.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.175
{\an1}It may look a little funky,
but it all works.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.510
And it's safe.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.886
Well, that's what's important.
Mm-hmm.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.471
{\an1}Don't you worry,
leave everything to me.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.848
{\an1}I'll make sure nothing
illegal is going on.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.517
You're being straight
with me, right, Dad?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.851
Completely.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.064
Okay, I'm sorry I asked.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.192
(phone ringing)

18:30.275 --> 18:31.360
Hello?

18:31.443 --> 18:33.862
DONNA: I called Mrs. Van Dyke.
She said it went great.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.072
Yeah, she loved everything.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.657
Not only that,
she gave us a referral.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.866
A Mrs. Jordan.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.368
Th-That's great.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.036
Yeah, the only problem is,

18:41.119 --> 18:42.871
she wants to see me
tomorrow and I can't.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.081
Can you cover for me?

18:44.164 --> 18:45.374
Look, Donna, I don't mind

18:45.457 --> 18:47.042
covering for you in a pinch,

18:47.125 --> 18:48.544
but to put it bluntly,

18:48.627 --> 18:50.379
I don't know why we're
splitting the proceeds.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.339
Oh, no, no, the fee
is all yours.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.882
Okay, listen, um,
I'm kind of in a rush,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.425
so can you leave the
information on my machine?

18:55.509 --> 18:58.053
Sure. Wait, Val, are you okay?

18:58.136 --> 19:02.391
Yeah, it's just, uh...

19:02.474 --> 19:04.768
Donna, how do you know it's
right between you and David?

19:04.852 --> 19:07.521
Right like...

19:07.604 --> 19:09.064
Well, meant to be.

19:09.147 --> 19:10.440
Like you guys belong together.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.361
Well, I know we belong together

19:14.444 --> 19:16.530
because of the way
I feel when we're not.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.865
You feel empty.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.909
Yeah, completely.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.536
You and Noah?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.745
Yeah.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.206
But if he only had
money like Cooper.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.374
I'm sick of being poor.

19:27.457 --> 19:30.252
Listen, um, I gotta go.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.378
Bye.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.422
(doorbell ringing)

19:33.505 --> 19:35.048
(sighs):
God.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.219
So, how about dinner?

19:39.303 --> 19:40.429
You know, you gotta stop

19:40.512 --> 19:42.890
{\an1}coming by here
without calling.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.558
I called this morning.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.602
Look, I'm-I'm really late.
I gotta go, it's important.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.563
More important than dinner
at The Mark Hopkins?

19:49.646 --> 19:50.939
San Francisco?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.317
The jet's fueled and ready.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.738
(sighs)

20:12.669 --> 20:15.047
Where the hell are you, Val?

20:17.007 --> 20:20.135
Well, it's like I said,
he owns the building

20:20.218 --> 20:22.095
{\an3}but he doesn't know
what's going on.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.972
What's this?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.558
It's a document I got from
the County Clerk.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.602
Sandtrap Properties
not only owns the building,

20:28.685 --> 20:31.480
it's also listed as one of the
owners of Soho Mix &amp; Match.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.231
So?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.485
So, we're not just talking
about building codes.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.111
Rush is also liable for any

20:38.195 --> 20:40.364
sanitation and labor
violations, as well.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.491
Ah, it's some corporate thing.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.326
I'm sure there's a zillion
reasons why some bureaucracy

20:44.409 --> 20:46.286
would list Sandtrap
as one of the owners.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
We just need one.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.874
You're not gonna mention
my father in this, are you?

20:50.958 --> 20:54.378
I'm reporting who the owners
of Soho Mix &amp; Match are.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.463
Sandtrap Properties
is one of the owners.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.132
Rush Sanders is the CEO.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.842
Bran, you can't do that.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.553
A lot of people are being
mistreated here, Steve.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.306
Donna saw one person
get a little steam burn.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.225
That one person was a kid!

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
Oh, please, spare me the sermon.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.020
We both know this
isn't about some kid.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.606
Really?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.274
What's it about, Steve?

21:17.442 --> 21:20.529
Circulation? Notoriety?

21:20.612 --> 21:23.824
The <i> L.A. Times</i> turned you down
for a job, didn't they?

21:23.907 --> 21:26.535
Well, a big expose
like this would be your way

21:26.618 --> 21:28.036
of showing them they
were wrong, wouldn't it?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.496
You're way off base.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.914
{\an3}Maybe.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.833
But maybe you want
to succeed so badly

21:32.916 --> 21:34.668
you don't care who
gets hurt along the way.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.503
I don't like doing this.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.379
Then don't do it.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.714
{\an3}I have to!
Then keep my

21:38.797 --> 21:40.048
father's name out of it!

21:40.132 --> 21:41.800
I don't think I can.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.407
Hey,

22:05.490 --> 22:07.075
what's going on?

22:07.159 --> 22:10.454
Nothing.
We've, uh, just been operating

22:10.537 --> 22:13.582
on such different schedules
lately, I haven't seen you much.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.917
Wow, smells good.

22:16.001 --> 22:16.877
{\an3}Swordfish,

22:16.960 --> 22:18.545
asparagus, mashed potatoes.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.673
Give me five minutes, okay?
(chuckles)

22:25.343 --> 22:26.303
{\an1}Oh, boy,

22:26.386 --> 22:28.305
looks like the post office
finally figured out

22:28.388 --> 22:29.389
where I live.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.100
{\an3}Yeah, along with bill
collectors, junk mailers.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.810
{\an3}Can you believe
that whole stack is

22:33.894 --> 22:34.811
{\an3}one day's worth
of catalogues

22:34.895 --> 22:37.230
and easy credit offers?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.690
{\an3}Let me throw
that crap away.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.908
So, how'd the
demo turn out?

22:47.991 --> 22:51.953
Uh, we, we didn't finish.

22:52.037 --> 22:52.954
Did you run out of time?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.790
Yeah, something like that.

22:56.249 --> 22:59.461
You know, just 'cause someone
says something

22:59.544 --> 23:02.547
a little off color
doesn't make him a bigot.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.800
{\an4}I don't believe that.
Devin's under
a lot of stress.

23:04.883 --> 23:08.470
All right? I gotta believe
that's why he says those things.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.971
I don't care about Devin.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.641
Well, Steve told me what you've
been saying about him.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.811
David, I want you to do well.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.147
I'm just not sure I want you
to do well with him.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.278
Well, at least the guy I work
with doesn't operate sweatshops.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.655
{\an3}Yeah,

23:26.738 --> 23:29.533
the difference is,
I'm doing something about it.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.994
You know, I'm not really hungry.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.497
I think I'm just gonna go
to bed.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.337
(sighs)

23:43.463 --> 23:45.966
(elegant piano music plays)

23:46.049 --> 23:47.843
How long have you been here?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.470
A while.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.848
{\an1}It's okay.
I was just practicing

23:52.931 --> 23:54.349
{\an1}this knot
that Noah taught me.

23:54.432 --> 23:57.310
{\an3}Did he walk you up
from the boat?

23:57.394 --> 23:59.354
Yes, he did.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.524
Brandon, would you relax?

24:02.607 --> 24:05.902
Sorry, I'm just concerned,

24:05.986 --> 24:07.028
{\an3}that's all.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.865
I know you are,
but I'm fine, okay?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.538
In fact, I'm even ready
for tomorrow.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.999
It shouldn't be too bad.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.169
Go in, point at the guy,
put him away for 25 to life,

24:22.252 --> 24:24.045
go home.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.547
If I remember.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.174
You'll remember.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.259
You remembered everything else.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.763
Everything else
I wanted to remember.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.016
This I would rather forget.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.351
Kel,

24:38.435 --> 24:40.228
this is gonna end,

24:40.312 --> 24:41.813
I promise.

24:55.785 --> 24:59.039
{\an1}My God,
what happened here?

24:59.122 --> 25:03.293
{\an3}Uh, I was, I was taking the
trash out, and the bag broke.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.086
{\an3}You know, we should
really get

25:05.170 --> 25:06.087
those double-strength ones.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.422
Yeah, whatever.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.715
{\an1}Uh, listen,
before I forget,

25:08.798 --> 25:10.258
{\an1}Devin called while
you were in the bathroom.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.761
{\an1}He wanted to make sure
you were still on for 3:00.

25:12.844 --> 25:13.720
And he was rude about it.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.890
He's just a little on edge
about the demo.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.434
But believe me, the music's
well worth the aggravation.

25:19.517 --> 25:21.937
Well, you know how
I feel about it.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.772
Yeah, I do.
And I really don't feel like

25:23.855 --> 25:25.065
arguing about it this morning.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.942
David...

25:28.026 --> 25:29.903
Are, are we okay?

25:31.738 --> 25:34.783
(sighs)

25:34.866 --> 25:39.579
Look, last night was
my fault, okay?

25:39.663 --> 25:43.416
You cooked a really nice dinner,
and I blew it off.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.460
I'm sorry.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.963
It's not even about last night.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.841
I just feel like we never have
time to talk anymore.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.803
I just... I really need to get
this band up and running.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.555
Then everything will
level out, I promise.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.475
I hope you're right.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.271
Bye.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.689
{\an3}Bye.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.985
(door opens and shuts)

26:27.544 --> 26:29.087
(dialing)

26:34.259 --> 26:35.885
Hi. Uh, yeah, I'm calling

26:35.969 --> 26:39.889
about this instant credit
application you sent me.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.016
Right.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.811
Um, what do I have to do to get
this activated today?

26:46.813 --> 26:49.190
(rock music plays)

26:49.274 --> 26:50.025
Whoop.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.359
Where's Steve?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.986
I told you
we're early, honey.

26:53.069 --> 26:53.945
He'll be here.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.990
{\an3}All work and no play
makes Steve a dull boy.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.408
He's as sharp
as they get.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.368
He'll be here.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.204
{\an3}Where'd you get this?
Chk-chk-chk-chk!

27:03.288 --> 27:04.706
(both chuckle)

27:04.789 --> 27:08.084
{\an3}He's really teed off that
we're doing this story.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.086
{\an1}Steve's just being defensive
because of his dad.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.922
{\an3}I know, but there's also
something in what he said.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.257
{\an1}And it's an important
story to tell.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.925
{\an3}Even if it hurts
Steve?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.053
Yeah, even if.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.352
Is that Eluvia?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.730
{\an1}No, but I think one of them
was with her yesterday.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.816
(people speaking Spanish)

27:33.818 --> 27:34.736
Excuse me. Hi.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.905
{\an3}Do you remember me?
I'm looking for Eluvia.

27:36.988 --> 27:37.781
Um...

27:37.864 --> 27:39.908
Oh, please, I really
need to talk to her.

27:39.991 --> 27:40.700
Eluvia not here.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.285
Well, do you know
where she lives?

27:42.369 --> 27:43.912
{\an6}No.
You can trust me.
I really need to talk...

27:43.995 --> 27:46.039
I don't know
where she is.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.210
(sighs)

27:50.293 --> 27:51.753
{\an3}I can't stick around
here much longer.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.254
{\an3}I've gotta meet Kelly at
the police station.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.547
I know.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.883
I think I'm just gonna
stick it out here.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.928
All right, I'll see you
at the paper later.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.054
Brandon...

28:02.472 --> 28:04.766
We're doing
the right thing here.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.102
See you later.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.905
Hi, can I help you?

28:18.988 --> 28:19.948
Brandon Walsh?

28:20.031 --> 28:22.951
Oh, um, he's not in, but
you can leave a message

28:23.034 --> 28:23.868
if you'd like.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.830
Miss Donna give me paper,
write his name.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.833
Do you work at that Soho, um--

28:29.916 --> 28:31.167
what's the name?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.794
Hold down the fort, okay?

28:32.877 --> 28:34.087
Soho Mix &amp; Match.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.674
{\an1}Oh, that's Brandon's bid
for Pulitzer Prize.

28:37.757 --> 28:38.967
I'm outta here.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.427
Boss fire me for talking

28:40.510 --> 28:41.344
to Miss Donna.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.638
I say nothing.
(sniffles)

28:43.721 --> 28:45.640
{\an3}Oh, honey, sweetie,
here.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.642
{\an3}Don't...

28:47.725 --> 28:48.810
It's okay.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.812
It's okay.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.981
Terri, uh, maybe a glass
of water, too.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.983
Yeah, sure.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.985
I never say nothing.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.821
{\an1}How long we work,
for pennies.

28:59.904 --> 29:03.950
{\an1}44 of us squeezed
like sardines.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.994
{\an1}No go to the bathroom
when we want.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.829
It's okay, it's okay.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.913
Where are you from?

29:08.997 --> 29:11.875
El Salvador.

29:11.958 --> 29:15.003
{\an1}Come here, try make
a better life.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.090
<i>Gracias.</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:21.176
I'll tell you what.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.179
Let's start at the beginning.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.222
I'm gonna record this,

29:26.306 --> 29:28.016
{\an3}okay?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.476
Okay.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.769
Your name is?

29:31.853 --> 29:35.023
Eluvia Alvarenga.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.026
{\an1}I need food,
need rent.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.028
Husband is dead.

29:40.111 --> 29:43.156
Okay, just take it slow.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.327
(doorbell ringing)

29:50.955 --> 29:51.873
Hi.

29:51.956 --> 29:52.999
Hey.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.544
Listen, um, about last night.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.546
Uh, I was on my way over and...

29:58.630 --> 29:59.923
No need for an explanation.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.925
I got your message
loud and clear.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.134
So then why'd you come?

30:03.218 --> 30:05.136
In a word: Laundry.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.430
Kelly said she'd, uh,

30:07.514 --> 30:09.015
leave it in the dining room.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.684
Ah.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.564
Nice flowers.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.358
{\an1}Yeah,
they're Kelly's.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.360
Wow, Brandon really
goes all out, huh?

30:20.443 --> 30:23.363
Must be nice to have someone
that cares for you like that.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.366
I wouldn't know.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.451
No, I guess not.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.955
Noah, wait, okay?
This is dumb.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.918
So when you coming back?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.753
Year. A couple months.

30:38.836 --> 30:40.088
Never.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.131
You can't stay away from me
that long.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.968
Try me.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.930
It wouldn't have worked,
you know.

30:49.013 --> 30:49.764
No, maybe not.

30:49.847 --> 30:51.766
But you were too afraid
to find out.

30:51.849 --> 30:53.768
Afraid to find out what?

30:53.851 --> 30:55.144
Would I have stayed
if you asked me.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.081
{\an3}Part of me hopes that nothing
comes back in there.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.084
Isn't that awful?

31:18.167 --> 31:21.087
No.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.965
{\an1}Either way,
when this is done...

31:24.048 --> 31:26.050
we move on.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.429
You ready?

31:29.512 --> 31:31.514
{\an3}Guess so.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.771
{\an1}Uh, can't have you
in the room with her.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.773
Procedure.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.859
I'll be all right.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.863
Right over there.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.533
There you are.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.785
{\an3}Now, they're not gonna be
able to see me, right?

31:52.869 --> 31:56.247
{\an1}They can't see you, hear you,
or get anywhere near you.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.207
You're perfectly safe here.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.335
Let's do this.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.641
Take your time, Ms. Taylor.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.975
Be sure.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.584
(tires squealing)

32:41.668 --> 32:45.088
(gunshots)

32:48.299 --> 32:50.176
He's not here.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.721
{\an5}WOODS:
Kelly, are you sure
it's not number one?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.181
I'm positive.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.939
Hey, you okay?

33:03.022 --> 33:05.358
{\an1}Yeah, I remembered
everything.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.527
{\an3}At least you were able
to ID the guy.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.570
No, I didn't.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.905
But I thought you said...

33:10.988 --> 33:12.532
Brandon, he wasn't in there.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.245
The guy I picked
wasn't in there?

33:17.328 --> 33:19.455
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.583
Look, I gotta tell you, um,

33:22.667 --> 33:24.752
eyewitness ID's are
not foolproof.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.421
{\an3}BRANDON:
Kelly, that's the guy.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.214
I'll never forget his face.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.924
{\an1}KELLY:
Neither will I.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.134
Not anymore.

33:31.217 --> 33:34.721
You know, I gotta tell you,
the DA might drop the case.

33:34.804 --> 33:35.972
But that's the guy.

33:36.055 --> 33:37.390
I'm not saying it isn't.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.392
But without the victim
corroborating,

33:39.475 --> 33:41.352
this guy can walk.

33:57.326 --> 34:03.124
(officers conversing
indistinctly)

34:03.207 --> 34:04.792
{\an1}What did you want me
to do, Brandon?

34:04.876 --> 34:05.960
Lie?

34:06.043 --> 34:07.962
{\an3}No, Kelly, I didn't
want you to lie.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.672
You know what?

34:09.755 --> 34:11.299
{\an1}I just went through hell
in there. I don't

34:11.382 --> 34:12.842
appreciate being
punished for it.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.137
I'm just frustrated, okay, Kel?

34:16.219 --> 34:19.014
{\an3}I mean, you have to admit
that an immediate ID

34:19.098 --> 34:20.933
by someone who didn't go through
the trauma of getting shot

34:21.016 --> 34:22.768
{\an3}and didn't have amnesia
for almost a month

34:22.851 --> 34:25.021
{\an3}is worth a lot more than the
one you gave in there.

34:25.103 --> 34:26.481
{\an1}It's like
the detective said,

34:26.563 --> 34:28.274
{\an5}your mind can play
tricks on you.
Exactly.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.318
{\an3}And whose mind has been going
through hoops lately,

34:30.400 --> 34:32.320
{\an3}yours or mine?
Brandon,

34:32.402 --> 34:34.322
{\an1}you've been under a lot
of stress, too.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.324
{\an1}Or did you forget
about your nightmares?

34:36.407 --> 34:38.159
{\an1}Or maybe it's that you
wanted to ID someone

34:38.242 --> 34:39.827
{\an5}so bad...
That I just picked
anyone?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.996
{\an3}I'm right about that
guy, Kelly.

34:42.079 --> 34:44.040
Just like I was right about
the make of the stolen car,

34:44.123 --> 34:45.373
the partial license...
All right, Brandon,

34:45.458 --> 34:47.001
you're right.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.128
{\an1}You're right
about everything.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.178
Misread the green.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.180
Amateur mistake.
(chuckles)

34:59.263 --> 35:00.640
{\an3}Okay, hotshot,
you try it.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.141
No, thanks.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.144
{\an1}Dad, uh, we have something
to talk about.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.979
{\an3}Sure, what's on
your mind?

35:07.063 --> 35:08.981
{\an1}Well, there's some people
making charges.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.900
{\an1}I know there's a good
explanation.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.485
You talking about that
garment business again?

35:12.568 --> 35:14.320
{\an3}I mean, you just told me
about it yesterday.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.322
{\an1}Yeah, well I need
a couple of answers.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.490
{\an3}Okay.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.492
Okay, what are
these charges?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.536
16-hour workday,

35:21.619 --> 35:22.578
no worker's comp...

35:22.662 --> 35:24.455
Oh, wait a minute,

35:24.539 --> 35:25.706
those are labor code violations.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.543
The people who own the business
are liable for those, not me.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.546
Yeah, see, that's where the
confusion is for me, Dad.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.548
You see, the County
Registrar's Office

35:33.631 --> 35:36.551
lists Sandtrap Properties
as the owner.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.052
Of the building, sure.

35:38.135 --> 35:39.887
Of Soho Mix &amp; Match.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.681
Well, on paper, maybe.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.725
Hey, look, I operate a
complicated business,

35:44.809 --> 35:46.060
{\an3}I got investments all
over the place.

35:46.143 --> 35:47.728
{\an3}Sometimes I don't
even know

35:47.812 --> 35:49.021
which offices I'm
supposed to go to.

35:49.105 --> 35:52.108
Either you own the sweatshops
or you don't.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.778
{\an3}It's not that complicated.
An honest businessman

35:55.862 --> 35:58.406
can't turn around these days
without getting tangled up

35:58.489 --> 36:01.492
into some politically
incorrect snafu.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.703
{\an3}One minute you're investing
in a rental property,

36:03.786 --> 36:07.081
the next minute you're playing
nanny to 44 immigrant workers.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.584
How'd you know
it was 44 workers?

36:14.755 --> 36:17.675
Steve...

36:17.758 --> 36:20.720
I'm sure we can find a way
to do the right thing here.

36:20.803 --> 36:24.098
Well, that's never been my
strong suit, has it, Dad?

36:24.181 --> 36:25.892
You should know that
more than anyone,

36:25.975 --> 36:27.852
always telling me
what a screw-up I am,

36:27.935 --> 36:29.520
insisting that I grow up,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.063
take responsibility
for my actions.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.649
Well, now it's me telling you.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.903
Except we're talking
about the real world here,

36:36.986 --> 36:38.946
not some school prank.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.656
That's all the more reason.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.242
{\an1}Now, I intend to do
the right thing.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.202
The question here is, do you?

36:53.336 --> 36:54.503
I'm sorry, Dave,

36:54.587 --> 36:56.505
{\an3}but I'm gonna have to
bill you the time.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.507
{\an1}Ah, here they come.
You're late.

36:58.591 --> 36:59.634
{\an1}Whatever.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.761
Go ahead,

37:01.844 --> 37:04.472
{\an3}set up.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.807
Here you go.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.517
Oh, virgin card.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.519
Yeah, check out that
magnetic strip.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.771
Never been swiped.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.648
Yeah, well, don't forget
who helped you

37:13.731 --> 37:14.690
when you were getting started.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.485
Oh, your name's tattooed
on my chest.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.616
You guys set?

37:23.699 --> 37:26.327
Yeah, we've been ready
since 3:00.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.330
{\an3}You cost me two hours
of overtime.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.665
(drumroll plays)

37:30.748 --> 37:32.416
(snickers)

37:34.627 --> 37:37.338
Hey, um, Brandon, you...

37:37.421 --> 37:39.382
{\an3}you know, I-I could stay
if you want me to.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.217
No, that's all right,
I'm gonna be here late.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.718
First thing in the morning
will be fine.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.345
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.680
Oh, hey, Donna.
Hey.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.141
(under breath):
Hey.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.060
So I waited all day.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.520
Eluvia never showed.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.522
Listen to this.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.482
STEVE:
Your name is?

37:56.565 --> 37:57.525
ELUVIA:
Eluvia Alvarenga.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.026
Eluvia was here?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.027
Yep.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.362
I need food,

38:01.445 --> 38:02.780
need rent.

38:02.863 --> 38:05.074
Husband is dead.

38:05.157 --> 38:08.369
STEVE:
Okay, just take it slow.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.372
Tell me about Soho
Mix &amp; Match.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.374
How much do you get an hour?

38:13.457 --> 38:14.583
ELUVIA:
No hour.

38:14.667 --> 38:15.751
Piecework.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.087
I work 16 hours a day,

38:18.170 --> 38:20.172
no overtime.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.216
They no like your work,
you get nothing.

38:22.299 --> 38:24.343
Sometimes they say they no like,

38:24.427 --> 38:27.513
then use anyway.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.306
It's everything we need, right?

38:29.390 --> 38:31.392
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.061
Pretty amazing
stuff, Steve.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.563
Yeah, that's why it's gonna
be a great story.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.732
You know, Steve,

38:37.815 --> 38:39.734
I could write this
without mentioning Rush.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.444
I appreciate that.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.319
But he knew something about it.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.363
I don't know how much
or for how long,

38:44.447 --> 38:45.781
but he knew something.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.533
Just tell it straight.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.577
You sure?

38:49.660 --> 38:50.786
Yeah, yeah.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.247
And put in it that he said he'd
fix anything that's wrong.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.582
You got him to agree to that?

38:54.665 --> 38:55.708
Yeah.

38:58.335 --> 39:01.255
I'm on it, partner.

39:01.338 --> 39:03.049
You did a good thing, Steve.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.218
I hope Carly and Zach
aren't too bummed

39:06.302 --> 39:07.803
about missing Magic Mountain.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.612
{\an3}Boat's over at
the supply dock.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.405
{\an3}I'm just on my way
over there.

39:28.407 --> 39:31.327
Okay, um...

39:31.410 --> 39:33.954
then I'll be quick about
what I came to say.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.957
{\an1}I just came
to say, uh...

39:37.041 --> 39:38.793
you're completely wrong for me.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.796
I don't like the way
you live or

39:41.879 --> 39:43.422
{\an1}what you do...
Or that I'm broke.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.424
Or how you behave.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.134
Or even where you
do your laundry.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.969
Let's just speed things up
to the end, then.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.138
I got a lot of work to do
before shipping out.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.141
Okay.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.227
All right, the end.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.148
It's really hard for me to say.

40:03.275 --> 40:05.277
Get somebody to replace you.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.363
Please, Noah.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.699
I really don't want you to go.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.493
What's gonna change if I stay?

40:12.576 --> 40:14.578
I don't know. I...

40:16.914 --> 40:18.958
But if you leave now...

40:20.626 --> 40:22.670
...we're never gonna find out.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.549
Come here.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.641
You were right.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.685
I am afraid.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.062
So am I.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.031
I'm sorry.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.491
It's not good enough.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.369
All right, well, at least let me
apologize to Zach.

40:55.452 --> 40:57.371
{\an1}He may not
forgive me, but

40:57.454 --> 40:59.331
at least he'll see what
someone's supposed to do

40:59.415 --> 41:00.624
when they screw up, right?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.316
Hey, Z-man.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.823
Guess you don't want to have
anything to do with me.

41:34.950 --> 41:37.453
I don't blame you.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.873
I know it hurts when someone
you count on lets you down.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.584
{\an1}Especially
if it's a grownup.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.586
They're supposed to know better,
right?

41:47.296 --> 41:50.090
A grownup let me down
today, too.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.968
{\an1}I'm sorry about Magic
Mountain, buddy.

41:53.052 --> 41:56.639
Zachary, I hope someday
you could forgive me.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.808
If you don't, I'll understand.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.863
Are you gonna forgive the guy
that let you down?

42:16.116 --> 42:17.868
I'm gonna try.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.700
It's never gonna end, is it?

42:59.743 --> 43:02.579
{\an1}They're never going
to catch the guy.
