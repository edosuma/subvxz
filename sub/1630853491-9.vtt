09:11.551 --> 09:13.654
Child, I can't even step one
foot outside the grocery store

09:13.687 --> 09:15.155
'fo I hear
♪ "Dance like some niggahs ♪

09:15.188 --> 09:16.757
♪ Got some money in this hoe" ♪

09:19.159 --> 09:21.662
How it feel to be more
than hood famous now?

09:21.695 --> 09:23.630
<i>Scary, actually.</i>

09:23.664 --> 09:26.767
People be acting like they know
you, but they don't really...

09:26.800 --> 09:28.669
know you.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.337
Well, they don't need to.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.308
Uncle Clifford rule 51,081...

09:34.341 --> 09:35.275
"Don't try to be everybody's

09:35.309 --> 09:36.944
- cup of tea.
- Mm.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.045
'Cause then you
ain't gone have none

09:38.078 --> 09:39.313
to sip on for yoself."

09:39.346 --> 09:41.014
That's the case,
maybe it's time for me

09:41.048 --> 09:42.983
to move on for real.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.122
But then, I don't wanna
leave you here with--

09:49.156 --> 09:52.059
Don't worry about me.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.995
I am grown enough to know
that this wasn't forever.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.738
Fact, I think I should get
used to being alone...

10:04.771 --> 10:06.773
...since I'll
be all on my lonesome

10:06.807 --> 10:10.010
in this house soon enough.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.980
Cliff, man...

10:15.749 --> 10:17.651
I just wanna be there
to hold her hand...

10:19.353 --> 10:22.122
...but they won't even
let me do that.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.824
Can you imagine not being
there at the end

10:23.857 --> 10:26.026
for somebody that you love
with all yo' heart?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.132
Hmm?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.167
Naw...

10:34.201 --> 10:36.003
naw, I can't.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.982
Flame or flood ain't been able
to take Miss Ernestine out.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.318
I doubt some Rona will.
She gone push through.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.986
Well, if she don't...

10:54.821 --> 10:56.656
...I want you to rap
at the funeral.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.693
-
- What?

10:59.726 --> 11:00.961
Girl, you a fool.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.064
Child, there's a lots goin' on

11:04.097 --> 11:06.700
in Chucalissa today.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.668

11:11.338 --> 11:14.408

11:31.291 --> 11:33.060
<i>Bitch, you been
livin' here?</i>

11:33.093 --> 11:35.862
Ha. How does
a rich bitch stay rich?

11:35.896 --> 11:38.365
- How?
- She doesn't pay rent.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.870
So... got the passports.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.207
- Bought the tickets in cash.
- Good.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.875
Everything's packed.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.378
<i>The kids stayin' another night
at my sister's.</i>

11:51.411 --> 11:53.747
Derrick got that new job
he interviewed for,

11:53.780 --> 11:58.251
so he workin' tonight,
and I'm gone be home so late.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.121
Great coverup.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.023
I'ma pick 'em up first thing.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.131
After tonight,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.499
you'll have everything you need

12:12.732 --> 12:14.301
to get those babies out of here

12:14.334 --> 12:17.003
and build a new home.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.105
How'd you know

12:18.138 --> 12:21.741
Chucalissa
could be that for you?

12:21.775 --> 12:23.276
Home?

12:23.310 --> 12:25.045
It's not.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.381
As soon as I know where
this casino referendum lands,

12:28.415 --> 12:30.083
I'm gone too.

12:31.985 --> 12:36.389
Tomorrow I'll either be
a very rich woman

12:36.423 --> 12:38.225
or a very dumb bitch.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.193
Hmm.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.462
So you really gone
sell the Pynk?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.233
I wonder where Uncle Clifford
gone work.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.835
Don't be worried 'bout
Uncle Clifford.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.171
- Be worried 'bout you.
- Can't help it.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.041
This place been more a home
than home been sometimes.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.346
Well, soon it's gone be
a casino.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.115
And with the benefits
it'll bring,

13:02.149 --> 13:05.352
I think that it might be better
for everybody in Chucalissa.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.523
So...

13:11.057 --> 13:12.826
...Autumn,

13:12.859 --> 13:15.195
where you goin'?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.097
Wouldn't you like to know?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.498
Mm!

13:18.532 --> 13:22.002
Just checking to see
if you follow yo' own rules.

13:38.552 --> 13:41.054
I ain't know
you was gone be back here.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.059
Uh, ditto.

13:48.094 --> 13:51.298
You need me to fill up
that water bottle for you?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.435
If you don't mind.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.632
You know... it does work.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.101
Only that the Big Bad Wolf

14:28.134 --> 14:30.470
swallowed the key to the tower.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.609
No matter.

Oh, folks 'round here know
I loves to play

17:04.624 --> 17:06.526

17:06.559 --> 17:08.094
Mercedes,
Roulette, y'all... Hoooo...

17:08.128 --> 17:09.629
We do need to
think about safety

17:09.662 --> 17:11.798
and utilizing
each other's strength.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.401
Mercedes, if you can't hold
that move at that point,

17:14.434 --> 17:17.170
can I suggest
that you base for Keyshawn?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.072
I ain't basin' for not
na'an one of these bitches!

17:19.105 --> 17:20.573
Clearly, you can't hold it
very long.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.308
And whose fuckin' FAULT
IS THAT?!

17:22.342 --> 17:23.676
Aye, aye! Big L, Big L!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.245
Whose fault is that, huh,
bitch?!

17:25.278 --> 17:26.146
- Real mature, Mercedes.
- <i>Diamond! Diamond!</i>

17:26.179 --> 17:27.280
<i>Naw! No bitch! Naw!</i>

17:27.313 --> 17:28.815
<i>C'mon,
'Cedes! Listen, come on.</i>

17:30.183 --> 17:31.618
Aren't you tired
- of the blame game?

17:31.651 --> 17:33.186
If you want to fly,
pick up those wings

17:33.219 --> 17:35.088
the sun melted off your back.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.689
It ain't anybody's fault
but yours.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.525
Quit blaming me!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.226
Only thing I blame myself for
is when I went in that room.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.161
<i>Mercedes!</i>

17:41.194 --> 17:42.495
Put seven pounds of pressure
on the trigger

17:42.529 --> 17:43.797
- <i>Mercedes!</i>
- and put the wrong person in paradise.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.064
- Aye, <i>Mercedes!</i>
- Is that how you really feel?

17:45.098 --> 17:47.567
<i>Aye-aye-AYYYEEE! Now, look.</i>

17:47.600 --> 17:49.102

17:49.135 --> 17:51.137
<i>but y'all gots to be
sisters right now.</i>

17:51.171 --> 17:52.739
Y'all gone have to trust
each other tonight

17:52.772 --> 17:54.641
<i>whether y'all like it or not,
otherwise, Roulette is right.</i>

17:54.674 --> 17:57.677
One of y'all bitches
gone get hurt.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.413
Somebody always
gets hurt on nights like this.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.484
I just know it betta not
be a bitch pockets,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.220
'cause you got four
hitters up in this hoe,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.155
and on a door at 50% capacity,

18:09.189 --> 18:11.324
shit, we gone make more
on the floor than the door.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.093
Percentage of the pot
is based on pull.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.829
There's only one hitter
who pullin' enough

18:15.862 --> 18:17.363
<i>to triple the door</i>

18:17.397 --> 18:19.599
of a club that can only do
50% capacity.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.303
So let me guess.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.205
Keyshawn the hitter
you talkin' 'bout?

18:28.374 --> 18:31.611
Autumn, maybe we can

18:31.644 --> 18:34.614
adjust the door,
split the pot four ways.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.683
No. You need this.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.392
Oh, she a hitter aight.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.828
Too bad she ain't got good aim.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.632
Y'all wanna try and re-open
this bitch?

18:52.665 --> 18:55.201
Gone head and try
and do it without me.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.874
OH!
Now, hold on now, girl.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.542
- Mercedes!
- Fuck.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.177
Girl, don't you be--

19:04.210 --> 19:05.245
<i>Fuck this club!</i>

19:05.278 --> 19:06.145
Don't you let
no bitch run you out yo' house!

19:06.446 --> 19:09.215
Mercedes! MERCEDES!

19:09.249 --> 19:11.551
I can't buss it like I used to!

19:11.584 --> 19:13.286
I'm way past retirement!

19:13.319 --> 19:15.388
I shoulda been out this hoe
five fucking years ago!

19:15.421 --> 19:16.556
Just--

19:16.589 --> 19:18.224
<i>God damn it!</i>

19:18.258 --> 19:20.293
Aye.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.195
24.5, heiffa.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.197
Fuck yo rules, Uncle Clifford!

19:25.798 --> 19:28.167
I need to hear
the truth.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.939
Keyshawn better than me,
ain't she?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.407
Mercedes,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.643
ever since I was a youngin'

19:36.676 --> 19:40.547
I thought I'd find me a castle
with a tall tower...

19:40.580 --> 19:42.515
and I'd lock myself up in it
and throw away the key.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.451
This place has been
that castle for me.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.487
But even castles crumble,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.889
especially if they made
out of sand. Hmm?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.226
Sometimes you just gone
have to learn

19:53.259 --> 19:55.395
how to dream new dreams.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.964
Seem like you talkin'
to yo'self.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.735
Hmm.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.267
- Oh, excuse me.
- Damn!

20:34.300 --> 20:35.368
Watch where the fuck you goin'.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.703
I ain't see you.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.705
I don't see why not.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.674
We haven't met each other

20:41.708 --> 20:43.910
- properly.
- Hmph. We might not of

20:43.943 --> 20:45.545
met each other... proper,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.580
but I know enough 'bout you.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.816
These walls... been whisperin'.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.317
Have they?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.785
Be careful 'bout them whispers.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.788
They ain't always
well acquainted with the truth.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.590
Good you leavin' tomorrow.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.926
What make you think that?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.262
These walls got ears,

21:03.296 --> 21:05.365
mouths too.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.681
<i>She's so amazing!</i>

21:21.714 --> 21:22.782
She's powerful
and so beautiful

21:22.815 --> 21:24.384
<i>all at the same time.</i>

21:26.719 --> 21:29.455
<i>She's so strong.</i>

21:29.489 --> 21:32.759
<i>Look at the lines
she's creating with her body.</i>

21:32.792 --> 21:34.460
<i>I-I've just never
seen anything</i>

21:34.494 --> 21:36.629
<i>like this before.</i>

21:36.663 --> 21:38.331
<i>My gosh, look at those arms.</i>

21:38.364 --> 21:39.899
<i>I would be so dizzy.</i>

21:41.734 --> 21:43.503
I got so dizzy,
I almost vomited.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.738
She's so strong.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.740
<i>♪Gawdess.</i>

21:47.774 --> 21:50.576
<i>I could never hold
my own weight like that.</i>

22:15.635 --> 22:17.937
You like it?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.842
That's what good art does,
I think.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.744
Discombobulates you.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.813
Shakes you, questions you.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.015
Makes you understand
there is a God.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.717
That creation

22:30.750 --> 22:33.753
is this beautifully imperfect

22:33.786 --> 22:34.954
perfect venture.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.489
I don't know if I'm doin'
all that, now.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.396
I almost ain't come to Memphis.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.833
Didn't feel like
the hour drive, huh?

22:46.866 --> 22:50.570
Didn't know if I wanted to see
you again after that night.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.139
I didn't want that night
to end the way it did.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.677
And yet, I was...

22:57.710 --> 22:58.845
grateful.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.617
I'm filing for divorce
from Cedric.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.519
You divorcing all that money?

23:06.552 --> 23:07.820
Happiness is more important.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.490
- Says a rich bitch.
-

23:12.024 --> 23:13.760
So this that dream
you was yappin' 'bout.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.628
Yeah.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.097
I never thought I'd be able
to do this again,

23:18.131 --> 23:20.600
make photographs,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.835
but seeing you that day...

23:22.869 --> 23:25.772
...backlit against
that setting sun

23:25.805 --> 23:28.875
made this all possible again.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.644
I never thought
I'd be on a wall, like...

23:31.677 --> 23:33.780
I look like gravity
don't exist.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.882
Not for you.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.618
There was a time I ain't think
I'd get back on a pole.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.520
Why?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.889
My right shoulder
was so fucked up.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.858
You see how I transferred all
my weight to my left side?

23:45.892 --> 23:48.127
- I had to use my weak side.
- If that's your weak side,

23:48.161 --> 23:50.129
I'd hate to get into a fight
with you.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.934
I don't think I'd fight you.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.837
Would you... fuck me again?

24:01.474 --> 24:02.508
No.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.113
That was business,

24:07.146 --> 24:08.548
not pleasure.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.752
Well...

24:12.785 --> 24:14.620
maybe a little bit of pleasure.

24:16.722 --> 24:20.660
Well, I wish we all
could turn our weakness

24:20.693 --> 24:22.195
into strength.

24:22.228 --> 24:25.498
Enjoy the rest
of the exhibit, Mercedes.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.935

35:16.682 --> 35:18.450
Two hundred and fifty K.

41:10.068 --> 41:13.471
Well, leasing would mean
I would have to stay.

about that too?

41:18.877 --> 41:21.613
Burying that bag of bones?

Autumn gone sell,

50:20.551 --> 50:22.387

50:22.420 --> 50:24.055
<i>This coulda been a cornerstone

50:24.088 --> 50:26.090

50:28.159 --> 50:30.361
<i>That's why other people

50:30.395 --> 50:32.764
My daddy always said,
"Trust a snake to be a snake."

50:32.797 --> 50:35.199
Yeah. And you is a snake.

50:35.233 --> 50:38.803
Au contraire, mon frère.

50:54.786 --> 50:57.355
But I know one thing.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.591
If she dead, she can't sell.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.765
You fired, Big L.

51:09.434 --> 51:10.435

51:24.282 --> 51:26.284
Well, fuck it, then.

51:26.317 --> 51:28.085

51:31.222 --> 51:34.325

51:38.262 --> 51:39.797
Hello? Hello?

51:39.831 --> 51:42.366
Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't hear you.

51:45.436 --> 51:47.472

Hey, what you
listenin' to, hmph?

52:03.387 --> 52:05.156
Something to ease my mind.

52:05.189 --> 52:06.691
These niggahs
got my nerves bad.

52:06.724 --> 52:09.560
- Must be some slaw.
- No, it ain't no slaw.

52:09.594 --> 52:11.562
It's just new, ain't ready
to be ate up yet.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.133
Last time I saw you,
you was just

52:16.167 --> 52:19.403
a little perpetratin' ass
trapper rapper.

52:19.437 --> 52:22.507
- Look at you now.
- Yeah...

52:22.540 --> 52:25.776
Lot done happened since the
last time I was at the Pynk.

52:25.810 --> 52:29.280
Hell, since the last time
I was in this room.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.648
Me too.

52:43.361 --> 52:45.897
How come you ain't dance
wit' the pack tonight?

52:45.930 --> 52:48.833
Can't dance
when you scared of fallin'.

52:48.866 --> 52:51.536
One thing I done learnt
in this little life of mine

52:51.569 --> 52:54.872
is that fallin'
can change a niggah life.

52:54.906 --> 52:57.441
Don't I know it.

52:57.475 --> 52:59.477
Ain't this funny?

52:59.510 --> 53:01.579
I still get nervous around you.

53:01.612 --> 53:03.648
Bwoy, bye.

53:05.550 --> 53:07.752
Naw, I'm serious.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.487
Got a niggah leg bouncin'
harder

53:09.520 --> 53:11.255
than the way yo' booty

53:11.289 --> 53:12.623
- Niggah, really?
- Naw, shawty.

53:12.657 --> 53:14.559
That's a compliment.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.394
<i>You got that type of ass</i>

53:16.427 --> 53:18.329
that find the grace notes
in a niggah beat.

53:18.362 --> 53:21.265
<i>It vibrate to that 808
like nobody business.</i>

53:21.299 --> 53:24.569
<i>On top of that, the way
you find them drops, mmph.</i>

53:24.602 --> 53:26.571
Makes sense why anything
Mercedes dance to

53:26.604 --> 53:28.439
gets the streets rockin'.

53:28.472 --> 53:31.275
I thought that was yo' girl,
Keyshawn.

53:31.309 --> 53:33.311
Naw, bitch, you's a legend.

53:34.579 --> 53:36.314
A niggah like me
just trying to be.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.418
If you don't mind,

53:40.451 --> 53:42.486
I'd like a legend's opinion
on some shit.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.757
Niggah, I might hurt
yo' feelings.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.594
I can take a hit.

53:49.627 --> 53:51.495
'Cause that's what legends do.
