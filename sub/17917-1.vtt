04:48.455 --> 04:50.589
  Remember mission objectives.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.124
    One. Find and locate any

Alpha team offline in less than

   They were a hell of a lot
       tougher than you!

05:08.175 --> 05:10.809
    Our single advantage is
      we have some idea of

05:10.911 --> 05:13.078
    what we're walking into.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.213
 This maybe the one day in your
life you get to be smarter than
         someone, Pugh.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.916

05:26.460 --> 05:28.060
      One hundred percent.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.561
   Good. Set it for ten hours
          on my mark.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.896

 GPS beacon. Five hundred miles
east from here, there's an Ohio

We don't hit the snooze on that
    sucker within 10 hours,

05:42.910 --> 05:45.544
 our friends under the sea will
 surmise this island is beyond

05:45.546 --> 05:48.013
    reclamation and nuke the
    almighty crap out of it.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.450
   So, assuming we get out of
        here as planned,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.352

      remember to turn the

   Did overall just do that?

08:57.504 --> 08:59.371
   Pugh, take care of Duggan.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.041
   Gibson: I think that's the
    last of them...for now.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.776
        Gibson! Med kit!

09:06.346 --> 09:08.446

  -The whole island's swarming
           with them!

Pugh: It's going to be okay.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.187

          have to do.
         -Not now, Doc.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.223

10:33.000 --> 10:34.099
         We gotta move.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.867
Let's move! Let's move! Come on!

10:36.937 --> 10:38.336
           Let's go!

11:00.827 --> 11:05.030
  If you're going to insist on
bringing her, you might want to
          shut her up.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.564
   It's gonna draw attention.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.103
         Let her rest.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.108
         Sit her down.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.177
         There you go.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.912
         There you go.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.548
   Bite on this for me, okay?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.485
- You're going to be okay.
 You're going to be okay.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.356
     It's going to be okay.
     It's going to be okay.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.293
- It's going to be okay.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.099
     You know what you have
         to do, right?

11:45.472 --> 11:49.174
- Pugh: It's going to be okay.
  It's going to be okay.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.843
         Any morphine?
              -No.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.552
   The facility is that way.
     Probably a mile or so.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.457
     We're going to have to
          keep moving.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.260
And you cannot
  bring her with us.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.262
You know that?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.398
     Jerome and Pugh can go
           with you.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.467
      I need to stay here
        and handle this.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.002
      What are you doing?

12:18.305 --> 12:21.139
I'm going to stay here so I can
position the GPS so I can light
      a fuse in this dump.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.508
      We have to find that
       research facility.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.210
  "We"? You're not a member of
       this team, Doctor.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.011
   You're a piece of carry-on
            luggage.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.147
  Listen, our primary mission
        hasn't changed.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.882
          Yes it has.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.485
   The minute that that freak
   took our Captain into the

12:33.487 --> 12:34.953
jungle my mission became keeping
         my men alive.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.957
   On <i> your mission</i> is to find
     whatever's left of the
          Alpha team.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.892
That mission doesn't get tossed
   aside just because you saw
   something that scared you.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.062
    So, what's it gonna be,
          Lieutenant?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.197
     Are you gonna do what
      you came here to do?

12:46.299 --> 12:48.032
 Or are you going to run away?

12:50.837 --> 12:53.171
         Jerome. Pugh.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.473
 Are you ready to finish this?

12:55.575 --> 12:56.908
Sir. Yes, sir.

12:57.844 --> 12:58.910
Lieutenant!

13:00.480 --> 13:03.548
- It's alright! It's alright!
 -Look at me! Look at me!

13:03.650 --> 13:06.284
Mikaela: She's turning!
   She's turning!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.989

13:11.091 --> 13:12.791
          Look at me!
          Look at me!

13:15.262 --> 13:18.530
         Keep fighting!
         Keep fighting!
         Keep fighting!

13:22.002 --> 13:24.402
- What the!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.371
    Jerome: You killed her!

13:26.473 --> 13:27.906
      Pugh: What was that?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.508
    Dispatching the problem
     before it gets worse.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.214
  She was dead the moment that
         thing bit her.

 Then I guess that birds, fish,
  and stuff are not a problem.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.888
    What exactly went wrong,
            Colonel?

27:05.257 --> 27:11.895
   The order was to create a
 weaponized strain of the Ebola
             virus.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.101
  And you know, when the army
  embarks on such an endeavor,

27:17.236 --> 27:19.136
   We split the work into two
            tracks.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.272
 Refining the pathogen to make
         the bioweapon,

27:22.408 --> 27:26.176
 and synthesizing an anti-serum
         to defeat it.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.578
              Why?

27:27.713 --> 27:30.814
 Why do you have the safety on
       your gun, soldier?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.484
So you don't kill yourself with
        it accidentally.

27:34.854 --> 27:38.355
 What we saw out there in that
   jungle, that wasn't Ebola.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.725
        No. Not anymore.

27:41.861 --> 27:45.896
The head of my bioweapons teamis
   also my second in-command,
       Captain Marshall.

27:46.032 --> 27:52.903
   Marshall, he created some
 mutated strains of the virus.

27:53.039 --> 27:56.173
      See, he was sloppy.
            Sloppy.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.242
  He didn't follow protocols.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.745
Why have protocols if you're not
     going to follow them!

28:03.449 --> 28:07.084
 So one of his strains was very
          aggressive,

28:07.219 --> 28:10.220
    its effects were beyond
something that we could control.

28:10.356 --> 28:15.125
 And so when infected, then it
became what you saw out there in
          the jungle.

28:15.261 --> 28:22.399
      Those dead, rotting,
  flesh-hungry animals. Devoid
 of any human characteristics.

28:22.535 --> 28:25.536
    What Marshall created...

28:28.874 --> 28:33.911
   just wiped the soul out of
     everyone it infected.

28:37.116 --> 28:40.284
      I was overseeing the
       anti-serum teams.

28:40.419 --> 28:48.325
 We were progressing on a cure.
   A virus that would keep at
   bay, but it was too slow.

28:48.461 --> 28:51.328
   This is why if I had your
  mother. This is why it would

28:51.464 --> 28:53.430
      have been okay. This
         was her forte.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.066
And the minute that it left the
     lab we were all caught
          flat-footed.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.802
 I was lucky to have survived.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.739
 Too bad you can't say the same
         for your men.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.807
  How did the pathogen escape?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.813
What are you implying, soldier?

29:10.850 --> 29:15.786
    I have been running this
   facility by myself for ten
             years.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.757
 I have protocols. I don't need
        your questions.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.460
 Okay. You don't have to answer
         my questions,

29:23.596 --> 29:26.830
 but I don't think HQ is going
    to be quite so patient.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.770
Oh you think that you could...

29:37.076 --> 29:38.976
    Gibson: What's so funny?

29:43.916 --> 29:46.216
    I'm not going anywhere.

29:50.623 --> 29:55.492
    The work that I've been
      doing here is far to
     important to abandon.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.532
Your "work" ended ten years ago.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.500
   My initial research, yes.

30:05.371 --> 30:10.908
But what I have been working on
since the incident, Mikaela, it
      is very interesting.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.844
 So you've been continuing your
           research?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.980
       We're scientists.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.549

   nearly seven years by the
       time I found her.

31:02.595 --> 31:06.230
    With the pathogen having
 affected nearly every organism
         on the island.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.266
Coupled with a mortality rate of
  nearly one hundred percent,

31:09.401 --> 31:13.904
finding a cure for the virus was
          challenging.

31:14.440 --> 31:20.344
 I had to find a way to reverse
  the effects of the virus. At
 least to slow its progression.

31:20.846 --> 31:24.848
   And it was during my lab,
      Myopia, we call it.

31:24.850 --> 31:31.588
     I discovered it had an
 amazing effect on human death.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.998
  You can see, the effects are
       just fascinating.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.033
    You're experimenting on
        your own people.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.169
  No, no, no, no. Not people,
 Lieutenant. They are cadavers.

31:46.505 --> 31:50.340
   They're just a little more
           animated.

31:51.277 --> 31:56.280
 So after all the tests and all
the death, your research hasn't
     yielded any progress.

31:56.548 --> 32:00.350
     There are many ways to
  gauge progress, Lieutenant.

32:00.486 --> 32:06.523
 And, my theory is that I have
   made remarkable strides in
        modern medicine.

32:06.659 --> 32:10.127
   And fortunately, I had no
    shortage of raw material
         to work with.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.529

           subjects.

Cadavers.

  suffered an agonizing death,
     only to rise up again.

33:27.506 --> 33:33.477
    I saved them from that.
I gave them, I gave them a gift.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.413

percent chance of arresting the

35:56.922 --> 36:00.223
   Of the thirteen and a half
percent left, most will succumb
          to the virus

36:00.359 --> 36:04.161
  and then you just dispose of
     them by destroying the
         hypothalamus.

     Wexler: Any population

a certain percentage is going to
 display an anomalous reaction.

36:27.252 --> 36:30.453
